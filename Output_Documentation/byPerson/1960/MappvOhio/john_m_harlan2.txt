justice
john
m.
harlan
you
say
"supposed
search
warrant"
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
the
only
question
we've
got
here,
as
to
whether
the
statute's
constitutional
or
not
constitutional,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that
means
you're
asking
us
to
overrule
of
against
colorado?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
issue
in
this
case
that
the
books
were
obscene?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
see
any
constitutional
difference
between
a
statute
making
possession
of
narcotics
a
crime
and
a
statute
such
as
yours
making
obscene
literature?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
think
they're
both
the
same?
justice
john
m.
harlan
really,
your
constitutional
argument,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
come
from
roth,
is
that
roth
says
obscene
literature
is
not
protected,
and
therefore
it's
just
like
contraband,
and
therefore
the
state
can
do
anything
they
want
with
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
statute
does
seem
to
contain
some
exceptions,
if
i
read
it
correctly.
section
2905
exempts
from
the
provisions
that
are
involved
here,
“teaching
in
regularly
chartered
medical
colleges,
publication
of
standard
medical
books
for
regular
practitioners
of
medicine
for
the
purpose
of
legitimate
business."
they
don't
affect
the
distribution
of
bona
fide
works
of
art.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
it
applies.
i'd
understood
you
to
say
up
to
now
that
there
were
no
exceptions,
that
the
charge
was
obscenity
in
and
of
itself.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
have
to
read
that
section
together
with
—
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
with
some
other
sections
that
bear
different
numbers.
justice
john
m.
harlan
bona
fide
art
associations,
whatever
that
is.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
this
is
29
--
the
one
you've
got
here
is
2905.34,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
exception
that
i'm
reading
says
2905.33,
which
is
the
one
before
34,
to
2905.36
don't
apply,
in
these
categories
of
things
that
i've
been
reading.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
2905.37.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
would
it
have
exempted
this
lady
if
she
--if
what
she
had
was
a
bona
fide
work
of
art
made,
published,
and
distributed
by
a
bona
fide
association
of
artists,
or
an
association
for
the
advancement
of
art?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
know
what
those
other
sections
define.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
she
out
now?
justice
john
m.
harlan
out
on
bail?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
the
rochin
case?
