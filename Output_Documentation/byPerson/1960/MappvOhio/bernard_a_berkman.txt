mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
get
into
the
area
which
was
allotted
to
me,
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
american
civil
liberties
union
and
its
ohio
affiliate,
the
ohio
civil
liberties
union,
is
very
clear,
in
response
to
the
question
which
was
directed
to
counsel
for
the
appellant,
that
we
are
asking
this
court
to
reconsider
wolf
versus
colorado
and
to
find
that
evidence
which
is
unlawfully
and
illegally
obtained
should
not
be
permitted
into
a
state
proceeding,
and
that
its
production
is
a
violation
of
the
federal
constitution,
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
have
no
hesitancy
about
asking
the
court
to
reconsider
it
because
we
think
that
it
is
a
necessary
part
of
due
process.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
we
are
asking
the
court
to
re-examine
wolf.
our
interest
is
not
necessarily
the
same
as
that
of
the
defendant
who
was
convicted
in
this
case,
and
our
claim
is
more
broad
than
that,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
think
that
an
argument
could
be
made.
i
think
that
there
was
certainly
enough
of
a
scuffle
under
the
fact
situation
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
the
handcuffing,
the
scuffling
about
the
physical
person
of
the
defendant,
and
so
on.
an
argument
might
be
made
under
the
question
of
rochin,
but
we
are
not,
because
of
the
peculiar
position
in
which
we
stand
before
you,
are
not
raising
that
technical
argument.
our
principal
reason
for
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union
and
its
ohio
affiliate
is
to
urge
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
ohio
obscenity
law,
which
is
section
2905,
subsection
34
of
the
ohio
revised
code.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
we
understand
that,
and
in
a
case
in
which
the
facts
were
such
that
that
could
properly
be
raised
we
would
be
here,
with
the
leave
of
court,
arguing
that
point
as
clearly
as
the
question
of
obscenity
which
is
now
before
us.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
it
is
a
fairly
new
statute.
the
statute
which
immediately
preceded
it,
as
i
understand
it,
did
include
possession,
the
words
"possession
for
some
criminal
purpose."
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
that
portion
of
the
statute
apparently
is
no
longer
with
us
and
it
seems
to
us
to
be
one
of
the
principal
constitutional
defects
of
the
statute.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
believe
it
was
in
1955,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
there
have.
i
think
that
the
principal
one
upon
which
the
prosecution
in
this
case
relies
is
the
state
of
ohio
versus
collins
and
that
was
a
common
plea
decision,
a
trial
court
decision,
which
was
carried
no
further
than
the
trial
court
opinion
because
of
the
fact
that
the
jury
found
that
the
defendant
was
not
guilty,
so
there
was
no
reason
to
proceed.
there
may
have
been
others,
but
the
prosecution
doesn't
rely
on
them
and
i
don't
know
of
them.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
the
only
legislative
history
about
which
we
know
appears
in
the
brief
of
the
representative
of
the
defendant
in
this
case.
we
did
not
consider
that
point.
this
lady
was
convicted
under
this
statute
and
given
an
indeterminate
sentence
of
not
less
than
one
nor
more
than
seven
years.
she
was
convicted
under
this
statute
despite
the
fact
that
a
majority
of
the
members
of
the
highest
court
of
our
state,
the
ohio
supreme
court,
felt
that
the
statute
itself
was
unconstitutional
and
the
reason
for
this,
of
course,
is
the
fact
that
article
i,
section
2
of
the
ohio
constitution
holds
that
where
there
has
been
an
affirmance,
a
denial
of
unconstitutionality
in
a
criminal
case
in
the
court
of
appeals,
it
takes
all
but
one
of
the
justices
of
the
supreme
court
to
hold
a
statute
unconstitutional
and
therefore
void
a
conviction
thereunder.
we
are
not
at
this
point
disputing
that
statute.
we
feel
that
it
might
be
a
matter
to
be
disputed,
but
our
interest
is
confined
–
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i'm
sorry,
the
constitutional
provision,
but
we
are
not
now
arguing
about
that.
all
we
know
is
that
at
least
four
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
we
understand
that
at
that
time
some
social
legislation
was
under
consideration,
and,
as
happens
many
times
situations
come
back
to
haunt
us.'
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
we
think
--
it's
conceded.
we
think
that
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
as
i
say,
we
are
not
now
contesting
that
constitutional
provision.
we
think
that
in
this
case
it
has
resulted
in
an
injustice,
and
we
think
that
this
court
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
those
facts
are
not
before
us,
your
honor.
the
statute
under
which
the
defendant
in
this
case
was
convicted,
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
reads
like
this.
no
person
shall
knowingly
have
in
his
possession
or
under
his
control
an
obscene,
lewd
or
lascivious
book
print
or
picture.
there
are
some
words
left
out,
but
this
is
the
heart
of
the
particular
statute.
in
short,
as
we
understand
it,
if
a
normal
adult
knowingly
has
an
obscene
book
or
picture
in
his
possession,
without
any
criminal
intent
whatsoever,
he
has
committed
a
felony
in
ohio.
now,
as
far
as
the
facts
are
concerned,
the
only
facts
which
are
pertinent
to
our
argument
are
that
she
was
indicted
and
convicted
under
this
statute.
she
was
not
charged
with
any
criminal
intent.
she
was
not
charged
with
distributing
this
material
to
minors.
she
was
not
charged
with
commercial
traffic.
she
was
charged
only
with
knowing
possession
of
lewd,
lascivious,
or
obscene
books
or
prints.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
i
think
not.
i
think
that
by
any
definition
which
this
court
would
choose
to
apply
the
material
was
obscene,
and
for
our
purposes
we
are
assuming
that
to
be
the
fact.
we
deplore
the
appellant's
bad
taste
in
the
selection
of
her
literature,
and
we
are
not
now
arguing
in
favor
of
pornographic
literature
for
the
population,
but
this
aesthetic
issue,
we
submit,
is
not
presently
before
the
court.
as
we
see
it,
the
central
issue
in
considering
the
validity
of
this
statute
is
this.
is
this
an
area
in
which
the
individual
has
the
right
to
be
let
alone,
to
be
free
of
governmental
restraint?
mr.
justice
brandeis,
dissenting
in
olmstead
versus
the
united
states
has
stated
it
better
than
i
could.
it
is
cited
at
page
16
of
our
brief
amicus
and
he
said
this.
“the
makers
of
our
constitution
undertook
to
secure
conditions
favorable
to
the
pursuit
of
happiness.
they
sought
to
protect
americans
in
their
beliefs,
their
thoughts,
their
emotions
and
their
sensations.
they
conferred,
as
against
the
government,
the
right
to
be
let
alone,
the
most
comprehensive
of
rights
and
the
right
most
valued
by
civilized
men.”
more
specifically,
however,
the
issue
is,
does
this
statute
constitute
an
invalid
exercise
of
the
state's
police
power
so
as
to
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution?
now,
we
do
not
deny
that
a
state
may
properly
legislate
in
the
area
of
morals.
nor
do
we
argue
at
this
time,
although
well
at
an
earlier
time
we
might
have,
after
the
decision
in
roth
versus
the
united
states,
that
obscene
utterances,
the
obscene
word,
the
printed
word,
are
within
the
protection
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
as
they
relate
to
free
speech
and
the
press.
in
passing
and
in
candor,
the
american
civil
liberties
union
adheres
to
the
proposition
that
all
forms
of
expression
may
be
limited
only
by
the
application
of
the
tests
arising
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments,
the
test
of
clear
and
present
danger,
or,
as
modified
in
dennis,
clear
and
proper
danger.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
we
are
asking
you
to
reconsider
roth,
in
addition
to
the
other
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
not
representing
individual
defendants,
we
have
considerably
more
freedom.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
we
understand
that,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
consequently,
we
would
like
to
direct
our
attention
to
the
argument
which
we
feel
is
directly
related
to
the
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
there
are
several
branches
to
our
request
to
this
court.
number
one,
we
think
that,
as
far
as
all
forms
of
expression
are
concerned,
they
should
be
protected
by
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
we
think
the
roth
case
--
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
a.
berkman
yes,
your
honor.
our
other
branch
of
our
argument
is
that
we
feel
that,
even
in
the
area
of
morals,
which
we
have
conceded
is
a
proper
legislative
area,
that,
as
in
other
permissible
legislative
areas,
such
enactments
or
statutes
must
be
reasonably
adapted
to
accomplish
the
legislative
purpose
and
must
not
be
arbitrary
and
excessive.
furthermore,
they
must
not
infringe
upon
paramount
individual
rights,
particularly
where
a
similar
legislative
result
may
be
achieved
by
other
less
drastic
means.
we
submit
that
interposing
a
policeman
between
a
normal
adult
and
his
library
is
not
a
proper
means
of
accomplishing
what
might
otherwise
be
a
valid
legislative
purpose.
we
contend
that
the
statute
is
arbitrary
and
excessive.
we
urge
that
there
are
important
individual
rights
which
are
protected
against
encroachment
by
the
states
by
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty
embodied
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
which
are
substantially
and
unnecessarily
limited
by
this
statute.
and
we
say
that
the
evil
sought
to
be
controlled
here
can
be
met
by
less
drastic
statutory
means
without
limiting
the
liberties
of
the
citizens
of
the
state
of
ohio
and
as
a
consequence
we
say
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
now,
our
brief
has
discussed
some
of
the
sociological
and
scientific
studies
at
page
8.
in
appendices
a
and
b
we
have
correlated
some
of
the
studies
which
have
dealt
with
the
question
of
whether
obscene
material
results
in
depravity.
we
note
that,
at
page
8,
the
conclusion
seems
to
be
that
there
is
no
positive
study
that
so
holds.
we
are
not
saying
that
this
is
a
necessary
consideration
to
the
matter
of
the
first
amendment,
clear
and
present
danger.
that
is
not
our
point,
but
we
are
trying
to
demonstrate
that
this
legislation
is
not
reasonably
related
to,
nor
adapted
to
the
accomplishment
of
any
legitimate
governmental
purpose.
why
must
the
relationship
be
shown
between
the
legislative
means
and
the
desired
result
more
clearly
in
this
kind
of
a
case
and
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
because
individual
rights,
such
as
the
right
of
privacy,
the
right
to
read,
which
has
been
substantiated
as
part
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
wolf
versus
colorado
and
butler
versus
michigan,
both
of
which
opinions
were
written
for
the
court
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
and
we
do
not
feel
it
necessary
to
consider
whether
the
fourth
amendment
is
incorporated
bodily
into
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
think
that
certainly
the
right
of
privacy
is
a
basic
concept
of
freedom
which
appears
there.
we
think
also
that
smith
versus
california
gives
an
indication
of
the
direction
in
which
this
court
may
go
in
this
case,
and
that
is
that
even
though
the
first
amendment
is
not
involved
in
a
matter
dealing
with
admittedly
obscene
material,
we
think
that
this
statute
certainly
has
a
potentially
inhibiting
effect
upon
freedom
of
expression,
even
if
the
material
itself
is
not
constitutionally
protected.
and
we
feel
that
the
evil
sought
to
be
controlled
here
can
be
dealt
with
by
means
that
don't
infringe
upon
individual
freedom.
we
think
that
there
are
other
ways
of
attacking
the
problem
of
obscenity
without
saying
to
a
person,
“you
cannot
have
in
your
possession
a
book
which
may
or
may
not
be
obscene,
which
you
do
not
know
is
obscene
until
you
read
it,
and
immediately
after
you
have
read
it
and
have
the
necessary
knowledge,
whatever
that
may
be,
and
that's
a
question
which
is
left
for
another
day
too,
as
soon
as
you
have
the
requisite
knowledge,
you
are
guilty
of
a
felony.
we
think
that
this
is
certainly
a
broadly
drawn
statute
which
is
not
necessary
to
achieve
this
purpose.
we
urge
the
court
to
keep
in
mind
its
own
admonition
in
roth,
in
which
you
will
recall
mr.
justice
brennan,
speaking
for
the
court,
said
this.
“the
door
barring
federal
and
state
intrusion
into
this
area
cannot
be
left
ajar.
it
must
be
kept
tightly
closed
and
opened
only
to
the
slightest
crack
necessary
to
prevent
encroachment
upon
more
important
interests.”
in
this
case,
your
honors,
the
door
cannot
be
left
ajar.
it
must
be
kept
tightly
closed.
