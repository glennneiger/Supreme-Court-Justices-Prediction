mr.
a.
l.
kearns
mr.
chief
justice,
this
honorable
court,
if
the
court
please?
we
have
a
situation
here
arising
in
cuyahoga
county,
ohio.
the
defendant-appellant
in
this
case
was
living
in
a
residential
neighborhood,
owned
her
own
home,
and
living
there
in
a
two-family
house
on
the
second
floor,
having
rented
the
first
floor
to
another
tenant.
she
lived
there
with
a
daughter
approximately
eleven
years
of
age.
the
evidence
in
this
case
disclosed
that
she
is
a
woman
without
any
record
whatsoever
from
the
criminal
point
of
view,
a
decent,
respectable
american
citizen.
one
day
these
police
officers
of
the
city
of
cleveland,
three
in
number,
and
the
record
sets
forth
the
occurrence,
came
to
the
house
and
wanted
to
be
admitted
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
search.
when
they
rapped
at
the
door
or
rang
the
bell,
she
looked
out
the
window
and
asked
them
what
they
wanted.
and
they
said
that
they
wanted
to
search
the
house.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
in
the
daytime.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
weekday,
yes.
and
she
said
that
she
would
call
her
lawyer
and
see
what
he
said.
now,
the
evidence
discloses
that
the
police
officers
claimed
that
they
were
informed
that
there
was
some
paraphernalia
for
the
numbers
game
in
the
house,
and
they
were
also
informed
that
a
person
wanted
for
questioning
in
a
bombing
was
in
the
house.
she
called
her
lawyer,
mr.
greene,
who
is
my
associate;
and
he
said
to
her,
if
they
have
a
search
warrant,
you
permit
them
into
the
house.
so
she
told
them
that
they'd
have
to
have
a
search
warrant.
one
of
the
police
officers
then
called
his
chief,
a
lieutenant
cooney,
and
told
him
he
couldn't
get
into
the
house
because
they
required
a
search
warrant
and
within
a
few
minutes
thereafter,
several
zone
cars
with
many
police
officers
surrounded
the
house.
then,
the
evidence
discloses,
at
least
two
of
the
police
officers
who
knew
--
one
was
sergeant
delau,
knew
what
he
was
there
for,
but
made
no
effort
to
procure
a
search
warrant,
neither
one
of
them
did,
but
they
testified
that
a
search
warrant
was
procured
by
a
lieutenant
white.
now,
they
didn't
know
about
it.
the
evidence
discloses
that
they
were
told
that
a
search
warrant
had
been
procured.
when
they
came
to
the
house
with
the
search
warrant
and
by
the
time
or
supposed
search
warrant,
by
the
time
they
arrived,
mr.
greene
was
also
there.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
there
was
no
search
warrant,
your
honor.
i
intend
to
go
to
that
from
the
evidence
as
we
proceed.
this
lieutenant
white
came
and
showed
a
piece
of
paper,
and
mrs.
mapp
demanded
to
see
the
paper
and
to
read
it
to
see
what
it
was,
which
they
refused
to
do,
so
she
grabbed
it
out
of
his
hand
to
look
at
it
and
then
a
scuffle
started,
and
she
put
this
piece
of
paper
into
her
bosom
and
very
readily
the
police
officer
put
his
hands
into
her
bosom
and
removed
the
paper,
and
thereafter,
thereafter
handcuffed
her
while
the
police
officers
started
to
search
the
house.
now,
the
evidence
in
the
case
discloses
that
the
state
claims
there
were
only
seven
police
officers,
some
in
uniform.
mr.
greene,
who
was
there
and
was
not
permitted
entrance
to
the
house,
but
who
was
kept
outside,
says
there
were
approximately
twelve
police
officers
in
all.
now,
the
evidence
discloses
that
no
search
warrant
existed,
although
they
claimed
that
there
was
a
search
warrant,
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
of
any
magistrate
that
had
been
asked
for
a
search
warrant,
there
was
no
record
of
a
search
warrant.
we
asked
during
the
trial
of
the
case
that
the
search
warrant
be
produced
and
it
was
not.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
our
own
supreme
court
found
that
it
was
very
questionable
as
to
whether
there
was
a
search
warrant
in
this
case.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
we
don't
know
what
it
was.
she
was
not
given
an
opportunity
to
read
it.
she
doesn't
know
what
it
was.
it
was
a
piece
of
white
paper,
but
the
police
officers
never
produced
it,
because,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
it
please
your
honors,
i
waited
in
the
trial
of
the
case
for
lieutenant
white,
who
was
supposed
to
be
the
man
who
procured
the
search
warrant,
to
take
the
stand
so
that
at
least
i
could
cross
examine
him
as
to
where,
when
and
how
he
procured
the
search
warrant
and
what
the
search
warrant
contained,
but
the
state
was
clever
enough
not
to
put
him
on
the
stand
and
no
other
police
officer
knew
anything
about
it.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
if
i
called
him,
your
honor,
i
would
have
made
him
my
witness.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
i
agree.
we
have
freedom
with
hostile
witnesses,
but
i've
been
practicing
criminal
law
for
a
number
of
years
and
i
know
what
a
police
officer
of
experience
can
do
to
you
if
you're
not
careful,
as
far
as
a
jury
is
concerned.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
i
did
not,
i
did
not.
but
the
prosecutor
promised,
and
we
have
the
prosecutor
here,
that
the
search
warrant
would
be
produced,
and
it
never
was.
so
the
situation
is
that
the
home
was
entered,
the
place
was
searched
from
cellar
to
roof
by
all
these
police
officers.
they
found
some
paraphernalia
in
the
basement
pertaining
to
some
lottery,
belonging,
later
it
developed,
to
someone
else,
the
tenant
downstairs,
and
she
was
tried
for
that
and
was
acquitted
and
following
the
acquittal
as
to
the
paraphernalia,
she
was
then
arrested
and
tried
for
having
in
her
possession
obscene
literature.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
of
having
in
her
possession
policy
paraphernalia
for
gambling.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
it
was
in
the
basement
in
a
trunk.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
oh,
no.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
later,
and
in
an
entirely
different
court.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
the
prosecution
for
the
literature
was
by
indictment,
whereas
the
prosecution
for
the
paraphernalia
in
the
gambling
transaction
was
by
affidavit.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
if
i
recall
correctly,
there
was
almost
a
year.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
no,
after.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
after,
after.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
different
courts.
this
was
the
court
of
common
pleas
–
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
--
and
the
other
was
a
misdemeanor
so
it
was
tried
in
the
police
court.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
same
search.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
yes,
your
honor,
the
same
search,
at
the
same
time.
now
--
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
well,
parts
of
the
same
trunk,
we
claim.
the
evidence,
of
course,
was
this.
they
claimed,
the
police
officers
claimed
that
they
found
some
of
this
literature,
a
book
or
two,
in
the
dresser
drawer
of
her
bedroom.
they
found
some
literature,
they
claimed,
in
the
room.
we
say
that
she
had
a
roomer
in
the
house,
a
man
by
the
name
of
jones.
he
had
occupied
that
room.
he
had
moved
and
left
and
she
had
corroborating
testimony
to
that
effect.
he
had
moved
and
left,
and
left
some
of
his
clothes
and
these
things,
including
a
.22
caliber
revolver,
in
the
room.
and
when
she
discovered
that
he
wasn't
coming
back
within
the
week
or
two
weeks,
not
knowing
whether
he
was
going
to
return
or
not,
she
started
cleaning
out
the
room
in
order
to
put
his
things
away
should
he
call
for
them
or
send
for
them,
because
his
room
rent
was
paid
to
the
balance,
to
the
end
of
the
month
and
she
wanted
to
clean
the
room
out
so
that
she
could
give
the
room
to
her
daughter.
and
the
situation
was
that
while
she
was
cleaning
this
room
she
found
these
things,
a
couple
of
books
and
so
on,
together
with
some
of
his
belongings
in
the
dresser
drawers.
her
testimony,
and
the
testimony
of
her
corroborating
witness,
was
that
they
took
these
things
out
of
the
drawer.
and
these
particular
books,
the
obscene
literature
was
in
a
brown
envelope,
a
paper
bag—and
that
when
they
took
these
things
out
they
saw
what
it
was,
and
she
said
to
the
girl
that
was
helping
her,
look
at
what
terrible
things
men
read,
let's
put
it
away.
so
that
they
took
these
things
and
put
it
in
a
brown
box,
a
small
brown
box
together
with
his
socks
and
a
hat
and
things
of
that
sort,
and
put
it
in
the
basement,
but
the
police
officers
deny
that
they
found
these
things
in
the
basement.
they
said
they
found
them
all
in
the
room
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
evidence
shows,
and
the
record
is
here,
that
they
even
denied
that
there
was
a
pistol
there,
then
later
the
other
police
officer
says,
yes
there
was.
so
they
didn't
agree
on
their
testimony
at
all.
however,
she
did
explain
to
them
and
sergeant,
mr.
haney
who
was
the
first
witness,
denied
that
she
said
that
these
things
belonged
to
a
roomer
that
formerly
had
had
this
room.
whereas
sergeant
delau,
and
the
record
so
shows,
testified
that
she
did
tell
him
that,
and
that
she
was
keeping
these
things
for
the
man
when
he
came
for
his
goods.
then
following
that,
of
course,
she
was
charged
and
she
was
tried
before
a
jury.
now,
the
question
came
up
in
the
trial
of
this
cause,
and
this
being
a
comparatively
new
statute
in
ohio,
the
statute
in
itself
merely
says,
"whoever
knowingly
has
in
his
possession,"
and
goes
on
to
say,
"pornographic
literature,
even
stories
of
crime,
is
guilty
under
this
statute."
now,
the
purpose,
the
reason
for
having
it
in
the
possession,
as
one
of
the
judges
of
our
own
supreme
court
asked,
what
do
you
say
we
have
it
here
and
i
said
you're
guilty.
no
question
about
it
because
the
statute
does
not
differentiate
for
any
purpose
of
having
anything
in
your
possession,
knowingly
having
in
your
possession.
and
the
court
charged
the
jury
that
under
the
statute
she
knew
it
was
there,
and
knowing
that
it
was
there,
she
had
it
knowingly
in
her
possession.
consequently,
he
practically
charged
that
she
was
guilty
and
his
charge
so
showed.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
without
reference
as
long
as
she
had
it
in
her
possession
--
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
even
if
in
the
cellar,
because
she
testified
that
they
carried
it
down
to
the
cellar.
so,
she
had
it
in
her
possession.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
no,
he
didn't.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
he
did
not.
he
merely
said
that
if,
for
any
reason,
even
--
he
even
went
far
enough
to
say
that
if
a
person
has
things
like
this
in
their
possession
and
conceals
them
they're
still
guilty,
because
if
they
find
that
these
things
were
concealed
because
some
of
it
was
in
a
suitcase
under
the
bed
together
with
some
of
the
man's
clothing
and
socks
and
things
of
that
sort
that
she
had
put
away
for
him
as
she
found
them
in
the
drawer.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
the
rochin
case,
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
that's
still
the
law
of
ohio.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
that's
what
they
decided.
that's
what
the
--
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
unlawful
search
and
seizure.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
they
didn't
decide
those.
that's
the
reason
we
are
saying
that
this
is
--
they
went
along,
so
on
the
question
of
a
constitutional
question,
the
violation
of
her
constitutional
rights.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
well,
that
is
right.
the
one
thing
that
i
say
that
i
am
asking
this
court
to
decide
is
the
question
of
the
deprivation
of
eight-and-a-half
million
citizens
of
the
state
of
ohio,
depriving
them
of
their
constitutional
rights
to
--
against
unlawful
search
and
seizure
–
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
--
because
one
man
was
to
be
put
in
jail
and
wanted
to
be
and
should
have
been
kept
there
and
that's
the
lindway
case
because
they
say
in
the
lindway
case,
they're
actually
advocating
anarchy
because
in
the
lindway
case
they
say
that
the
police
officers
that
come
to
the
home
without
a
search
warrant
are
trespassing.
consequently,
if
they're
trespassers,
you
may
use
force
to
keep
them
out
of
your
home,
but
if
they
find
contraband
then
the
court
will
not
inquire
as
to
whether
it
was
lawfully
obtained
or
not.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
one
of
the
questions
i
am
trying
to
–
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
judge
frankfurter,
i
thought
i
would
start
giving
you
the
factual
situation
and
now
i
will
come
to
questions.
the
question
is
of
course
is
–
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
yes,
it
is.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
yes,
it
is.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
it
was
raised
in
our
court,
but
of
course,
they
didn't
actually
decided
by
putting
it
into
the
syllabus
or
the
syllabi
at
all.
the
situation
is
that
we
could
do
more
then
raise
the
question
as
has
been
previously
decided
by
our
own
supreme
court,
and
we
are
citing
those
decisions.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
we
do.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
to
my
knowledge,
yes,
it
is
right,
but
may
i
have
a
moment
and
i'll
read
part
of
it.
this
is
the
--
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
the
opinion
by
judge
taft
of
our
supreme
court.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
page
91
of
the
record.
now,
they
say
her
evidence
clearly
discloses
that
defendant
not
only
took
possession
and
control
of
the
room
which
she
had
rented,
but
also
of
the
belongings
of
her
former
tenant,
including
the
books
and
pictures
which
the
undisputed
evidence
shows
she
knew
to
be
lewd
and
lascivious.
hence
it
follows
that
if
the
portion
of
section
2905.34,
revised
code
that
was
applied
in
the
instant
case
is
not
unconstitutional
and
void,
then,
even
if
we
assume
that
there
were
errors
in
the
trial
court's
charge
as
defendant
argues,
such
errors
could
not
have
prejudiced
the
defendant.
so
they
speak
of
the
charge
of
the
court,
but
they
hold
that
it
wasn't
prejudicial
because
if
the
statute
itself
is
not
unconstitutional,
then
the
charge
of
the
court
was
not
prejudicial.
now,
personally,
of
course,
i
don't
agree
with
that,
but
--
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
two
questions,
as
we
see
it,
very
respectfully
submitted
is
the
question
of
is
the
statute
constitutional
under
which
she
was
convicted
and
the
search
and
seizure
proposition
in
this
cause.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
no,
i
don't
believe
we
are.
all
that
we're
asking
is
that
we
have
this
lindway
that
i'm
setting
forth
in
our
brief
that
is
controlling
the
entire
state
of
ohio.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
that's
right.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
well,
we
went
through
the
wolf
case,
but
we
don't
refer
to
it
here.
i
think
maybe
the
state
does,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
we
are,
as
citizens
of
ohio,
deprived
of
our
constitutional
rights
against
unlawful
search
and
seizure.
now,
may
i
go
on
with
judge
taft's
wording,
“defendant
contends
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
was
violated
by
her
conviction
for
possession
and
control
of
these
books
and
pictures
since
that
conviction
was
based
primarily
upon
their
unlawful
seizure
from
her
during
an
unlawful
search
of
her
home.”
there
is,
in
the
record,
considerable
doubt
as
to
whether
there
ever
was
any
warrant
for
the
search
of
defendant's
home.
no
warrant
was
offered
in
evidence.
there
was
no
testimony
as
to
who
issued
any
warrant
or
as
to
what
any
warrant
contained,
and
the
absence
from
evidence
of
any
such
warrant
is
not
explained
or
otherwise
accounted
for
in
the
record.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
tending
to
prove
or
from
which
an
inference
may
be
drawn
and
no
one
has
even
suggested
that
any
warrant
that
we
may
assume
that
there
may
have
been
described
anything
other
than
policy
paraphernalia
as
things
to
be
searched
for.
then
we
speak
of
our
statute.
section
2933.24,
requires
a
search
warrant
to
particularly
described
of
things
to
be
searched
for.
and
2905.35
of
the
revised
code,
our
constitution,
section
14
of
article
i,
specifically
forbids
the
issuance
of
any
such
warrant
except
upon
probable
cause
supported
by
oath
or
affirmation
particularly
describing
the
place
to
be
searched
and
things
to
seized.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
i
don't
believe
they
do,
your
honor,
although
they
speak
of
it,
and
they've
spoken
of
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
the
supreme
court,
but
they
don't
contend
that
there
was.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
no,
i
just
read
you
where
he
says
that
there
is
no
valid
search
warrant.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
it
certainly
is
because
--
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
no,
it
isn't.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
there
was
an
unlawful
search.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
i
did.
i
even
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
in
the
trial
court,
which
motion
was
overruled.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
of
any
response,
nothing.
the
record
shows
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
was
filed,
was
argued
for
the
court,
and
the
court
overruled
it.
and
i'll
say
to
this
court
very
honestly
that
the
court
overruled
that
because
of
the
lindway
case.
it
is
the
lindway
case
that
controls
them
because
time
and
again
we've
had
the
same
question
in
our
courts,
in
which
the
court
would
turn
to
me
and
say
well
mr.
kearns
can
we
say
anything
about
this
since
the
lindway
case
is
still
on
the
books.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
that
is
right,
and
if
they
do
not
find
contraband
then
they
are
liable
to
a
suit
for
being
trespassers,
that's
what
the
law
–
the
case
holds.
as
far
as
the
case
itself
is
concerned
because
at
that
time,
in
1935
i
believe
it
was,
there
was
this
one
man
who
was
making
bombs
for
the
unionists
and
so
he
was
convicted
and
he
rightfully
so
and
judge
herbert
in
his
dissenting
opinion
speaks
of
that
situation,
but
let
us
look
at
this
other
question.
here
is
a
woman
who
was
lawfully
in
her
own
home.
she
is
not
exhibiting
anything
like
this.
she
is
not
trying
to
sell
it,
she
is
not
throwing
anything.
assuming
that
they
did
find
it
in
her
home,
the
sentence,
the
sentence
imposed
upon
her
is
one
to
seven
years
for
having
exercising
let
us
say
her
right
to
look
at
a
book
that
she
shouldn't
look
at,
to
have
in
her
possession
a
book
that
she
shouldn't
have.
not
that
she
is
a
criminal,
not
that
she
has
a
former
record,
but
one
to
seven
years
imposed
upon
her
for
daring
to
have
a
book
of
this
sort
in
her
home.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
well,
constitutionally
haven't
her
constitutional
rights
been
violated?
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
on
the
severity
of
it.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
yes
and
we
cite
it
in
our
brief
with
the
constitutional
provision.
isn't
it
cruel
and
unusual,
in
a
matter
of
this
sort?
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
your
honor,
the
character
and
type,
you're
right,
but
in
this
case
the
court
had
the
right
to
give
her
a
money
fine
under
the
same
statute,
had
he
seen
fit
to
do
so.
now,
where
we
have
a
person
who
commits
crime,
where
we
have
a
person
who's
a
criminal
and
the
record
so
shows,
that's
one
thing,
but
here
we
have
an
honest-to-goodness
mother
of
an
eleven
year
old
child,
living
in
her
own
home,
not
bothering
anybody
and
she
is
not
given
a
fine
under
this
statute.
she
is
sentenced
to
seven
years
in
the
penitentiary
for
daring
to
have
this
in
her
possession.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
that
is
true.
but
i'm
assuming
for
the
sake
and
purpose
of
the
discussion
that
the
books
were
there
and
that
this
court
may
feel
that
it
was
a
crime,
but
we
do
say
that
this
is
not
a
crime
under
the
factual
situation
in
this
case;
that
she
did
not
intend
to
commit
a
crime;
that
she
did
not
intend
to
injure
any
of
the
other
citizenry
of
the
state
of
ohio.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
i
do.
i
do,
for
the
sake
of
this
discussion
if
she
was
constitutionally
convicted,
but
i
say,
of
course,
that
she
was
not
constitutionally
convicted.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
and,
our
supreme
court,
four
judges
of
the
seven
found
that
she
was
not
constitutionally
convicted,
but
under
our
particular
procedure
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
lower
court,
and
where
there
is
an
affirmance,
then
we
need
six
of
the
seven
jurists
to
hold
this
unconstitutional,
and
we
only
had
four
of
the
seven.
that's
the
situation
that
we're
asking
that
this
court
look
into
and
correct
the
rights
of
this
particular
individual,
this
plaintiff,
defendant-appellant.
i'm
going
to
give
mr.
berkman
an
opportunity,
if
the
court
will
permit
me,
to
say
a
few
words
on
behalf
of
the
civil
liberties
union.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
do
i
have
--
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
thank
you,
your
honor.
to
answer
the
question
that
was
asked
pertaining
to
our
supreme
court's
ruling,
on
page
13
of
our
brief,
our
supreme
court
has
said,
“under
our
statute
as
now
worded,
mere
possession
is
forbidden
even
where
the
possessor
does
not
have
a
purpose
of
again
looking
at
the
books
or
pictures;
and,
in
the
instant
case,
the
jury
could
have
found
the
defendant
guilty
and
she
could
have
been,
as
she
was,
sentenced
as
a
felon,
even
though
it
believed
her
evidence
that
she
had
innocently
acquired
possession
of
these
articles,
had
no
intention
of
ever
looking
at
them
again
and
was
merely
keeping
them
pending
instructions
for
their
disposition
from
their
owner
and
then
they
cite
cases
from
this
court.
now,
the
charge
of
the
court
to
the
jury,
that
portion
of
it
is
found
on
page
65
of
our
record.
number
three;
that
the
defendant
had
in
her
possession
and
under
her
control
the
books,
pictures
and
photographs
mentioned
in
the
indictment.
'possession'
means
the
act
or
state
of
detaining
a
thing.
it
is
the
act
of
holding
or
keeping
it.
now,
such
detention
does
not
mean
that
it
is
necessary
always
to
have
in
one's
sight
the
thing
possessed.
for
example,
one
who
deposits
articles
in
a
place
of
concealment
may
still
be
deemed
to
have
them
in
his
possession.
to
have
something
under
one's
control
is
to
have
the
present
right
and
power
to
do
with
it
as
one
wills.
so
that
the
court
actually
told
the
jury
that
under
the
language
of
this
statute
the
defendant
in
this
cause
was
guilty.
now,
a
question
arises
as
to
what
should
she
have
done
with
these
things
after
she
discovered
that
they
were
improper
things
to
have
in
her
possession.
now,
our
statute,
section
2909.01,
reads
as
follows
--
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
thank
you.[recess]
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
thank
you,
your
honor.
a
question
arose
as
to
what
this
defendant-appellant
could
have
done
with
these
--
this
material
after
she
found
them.
now,
we
have
section
2909.01
of
the
ohio
statute
which
reads
as
follows,
"no
person
shall
maliciously
destroy
or
injure
property
not
his
own.
whoever
violates
this
section
shall
be
in
prison
not
less
than
one
nor
more
than
seven
years
if
the
value
of
the
property
destroyed
or
the
injury
done
is
$100
or
more.”
so,
that
this
being
--
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
well,
if
she
called
it
to
the
attention
of
the
police,
she
would
still
be
in
possession
under
this
statute.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
and
--
and
if
the
police
were
of
the
type
that
they
were
and
doing
the
things
that
they
did
they
usually
do
in
cuyahoga
county
using
their
badges
as
supreme
authority,
they
would
have
done
the
same
thing
by
prosecuting
her.
i
want
to
just
say
a
word
or
two
in
the
language
of
our
judges.
now,
in
the
opinion
of
judge's
taft,
bell,
herbert
and
peck,
the
portion
of
section
2905.34,
revised
code
upon
which
defendant's
conviction
was
based,
now
this
is
the
majority
opinion,
is
constitutionally
invalid
and
for
that
reason,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
however,
section
2
of
article
iv
of
the
constitution
of
ohio
reads
in
part,
“no
law
shall
be
held
unconstitutional
and
void
by
the
supreme
court
without
the
concurrence
of
at
least
all,
but
one
of
the
judges
except
in
the
affirmance
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
declaring
a
law
unconstitutional
and
void.”
now,
i
just
want
to
say
a
word
about
the
reading
from
the
dissenting
opinion
of
our
judge
herbert
of
the
supreme
court.
and
he
says,
although
i
concur
in
paragraphs
one
and
three
of
the
syllabus,
i
must
dissent
from
paragraph
2
which
follows
state
versus
lindway,
131
ohio
state,
page
166
and
the
judgment.
the
facts
are
sufficiently
stated
in
the
majority
opinion.
section
14
article
i
of
the
ohio
constitution
provides
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secured
on
their
persons,
houses,
papers
and
possessions
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
shall
not
be
violated
and
no
warrant
shall
issue,
but
upon
probable
cause
supported
by
oath
or
affirmation
particularly
describing
the
place
to
be
searched
and
the
person
and
things
to
be
seized.
the
judgment
in
the
lindway
case
is
not
in
conflict
with
this
constitutional
provision.
had
i
been
a
member
of
this
court
at
that
time,
i
would
have
joined
in
the
judgment
as
all
the
members
of
the
court
tended
because
the
evidence
there
clearly
established
that
the
defendant
was
operating
a
bomb
manufacturing
shop
in
the
basement
of
that
house.
as
stated
by
judge
jones
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
that
case.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
the
relevance
that
it
has
to
our
point
--
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
state
constitutional
provision
as
well
as
the
federal
constitutional
provision.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
i
was
reading
from
the
state
constitutional
provision
as
same
as
section
--
practically
a
copy
of
our
own
federal
constitutional
provision
which
is
the
same
that
the
people
be
secured
in
their
homes
against
unlawful
search
and
seizure.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
not
that
they
held.
this
is
the
dissenting
opinion
your
honor
--
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
--
of
judge
herbert
--
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
--
reading
the
state
constitutional
provision
which
is
identical
with
the
federal
constitutional
provision
as
to
unlawful
search
and
seizure.
but
i
just
want
to
show
this
court
--
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
well,
we
feel
that
in
the
wolf
case,
this
court
did
not
intend
to
make
it
a
general
matter
or
proposition
of
that
sort
because
of
the
fact
that
there
are
such
exceptions
where
as
in
the
lindway
case,
where
there
is
real
criminality,
where
there
is
violation
of
law
knowingly,
intentionally
and
profitably
as
in
the
case.
in
this
case,
shall
we
be
--
have
our
constitutional
rights
denied,
wouldn't
we
do
not
violate
the
law
except
probably
looking
at
or
reading
for
the
mental
state
the
wrong
type
of
literature?
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
i
think
it
does.
here,
we
have
a
situation
if
it
please
the
court,
where
there
was
absolutely
no
intent
to
violate
the
law
where
the
public
could
not
be
injured.
we
were
speaking
of
the
damage
that
narcotics
might
be
cause
by
having
possession.
that's
a
matter
of
health.
that's
a
matter
of
the
body.
here,
we
are
trying
to
control
the
american
mind
as
to
what
they
shall
read
and
what
they
shall
not
to
look
at.
mr.
a.
l.
kearns
the
--
we
--
that's
--
i
--
i
can't
say
definitely
your
honor.
i
--
i'm
very
sorry,
but
i
don't
have
all
of
the
facts
in
the
case,
just
the
conclusions
that
i
reached
came
through
upon
that.
though
i
want
to
thank
the
court
very,
very
much
for
the
opportunity
of
appearing
before
you.
