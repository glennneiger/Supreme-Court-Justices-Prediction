justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
no
charge,
was
there,
here,
that
she
attempted
to
disseminate
it
or
intended
to
disseminate
it
or
intended
to
circulate
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
wouldn't
she?
that
statute
says
if
she
had
possession?
she
had
possession,
and
if
she
didn't
burn
it
or
throw
it
away
or
something,
why
wouldn't
she
be
guilty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
there's
any
difference?
do
you
think
a
person
can
get
off
by
saying,
i'm
holding
all
this
obscene
literature
for
somebody
else,
and
therefore
i'm
not
guilty
under
the
act?
is
that
the
court's
opinion
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
not
available?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
she
knew
about
it,
she
knew
it
was
there
in
her
house?
justice
hugo
l.
black
she
knew
it
was
there,
and
that
it
was
very
obscene,
and
didn't
do
anything.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
under
a
statute
that
makes
it
a
crime
to
have
morphine
or
narcotics
that
a
person
could
get
out,
on
the
basis
that
he
was
holding
or
in
possession
for
somebody
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
prohibition
times,
the
possession
of
liquor.
it
didn't
make
any
difference
who
it
belonged
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
it
might
be
wiser
not
to
discuss
the
university
libraries
much
further,
for
the
benefit
of
the
university
libraries.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
said
a
few
moments
ago
that
if
they
had
possession
and
it
was
obscene,
then
they
should
be
prosecuted.
you
tell
me
now
they've
not
been
doing
their
duty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
couldn't
draw
any
distinction
under
this
statute
between
a
university
librarian
and
anybody
else,
could
you?
as
far
as
you're
concerned
as
a
prosecutor,
am
i
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
she's
not
charged
with
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
circulating
library.
[laughter]
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
do
not
apply
to
this
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
all
the
exceptions
apply
to
each
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
apply
to
the
statute
under
which
this
lady
was
convicted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
understand
your
other
argument.
do
i
understand
that
the
exceptions
there
apply
to
the
statute
which
isn't
here,
or
do
they
apply
also
to
this
statute
under
which
this
lady
was
convicted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
â€“
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
what
relevance
to
that
as
to
your
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
state
--
state
constitutional
provision.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
reading
from
that.
i
thought
the
state
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
you
are
reading
what
the
supreme
court
has
held
with
reference
to
its
own
state
constitutional
provisions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
all
than
more.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
reach
the
question
that
you
ask
about
several
times.
that
is
assume
that
--
what
is
assumed
which
would
be
illegal
on
the
federal
constitution,
what
you
do
with
the
wolf
case,
you
said
that
did
not
justify
holding
it
unconstitutional
to
admit
evidence
that
is
the
result
of
the
search
has
been
made.
