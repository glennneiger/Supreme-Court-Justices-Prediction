mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
may
it
please
the
court
and
mr.
chief
justice?
at
the
outset,
i
want
to
say
this,
that
when
this
case
was
pending
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
or
just
after
its
deposition,
one
of
the
state's
exhibits
disappeared,
one
of
the
obscene
books.
and
when
the
exhibits
were
returned
to
the
clerk
of
the
court
of
common
pleas,
there
was
just
the
cover
of
this
one
obscene
book
that
came
back,
and
we
don't
know
what
happened
to
it.
i'm
only
mentioning
this
because
you
may
be
wondering,
if
you
examined
the
exhibits,
why
one
of
the
books
only
has
a
cover
and
the
rest
of
it
is
gone.
what
happened
to
it?
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
that's
right,
your
honor.
there
was
never
any
issue
--
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
no,
it
wouldn't,
except
that
i
did
not
introduce
the
cover
as
an
exhibit.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
well,
that
shows
you
the
necessity
for
the
provision
in
this
statute
against
possession,
knowing
possession.
i'm
not
referring
to
the
clerk
now.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
well,
frankly,
the
statute
doesn't
prohibit
reading
an
obscene
book.
it
doesn't
prohibit
looking
at
an
obscene
picture.
the
very
terminology
of
the
statute
shows
that
the
whole
purpose
of
it
is
to
prevent
the
circulation
of
obscenity.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
mr.
justice
brennan,
if
he
has
unlawful
possession
and
knowing
possession
--
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
that's
the
charge,
in
the
indictment
that
this
woman
was
charged.
of
course,
it
had
to
be
an
unlawful
possession.
in
other
words
there
is
--
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
i
disagree,
your
honor.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
well,
there
is
a
--
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
well,
there
is
a
possession
in
the
hands
of
the
prosecution.
for
example,
i've
had
those
obscene
books
and
pictures
for
the
purposes
of
prosecution.
the
courts
had
them
for
exhibits.
now,
there's
a
distinction,
certainly,
under
the
law,
between
a
lawful
possession
and
an
unlawful
possession
as
prohibited
by
the
statute.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
circulation,
i
–
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
there
has
been
no
such
construction,
but
a
reading
of
terminology--
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
that
is
right,
but
inherent
in
the
element
of
possession
is
the
opportunity
for
circulation,
wouldn't
you
say,
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
well,
that's
what
i
have
in
mind
in
connection
with
the
additional
provision
in
the
ohio
statute
which
was
made
in
1955.
prior
to
that
time,
it
prohibited
possession,
but
possession
for
the
purposes
of
exhibition
or
for
the
purposes
of
sale.
it
was
limited
to
that.
in
1955,
the
legislature
included
this
provision
to
prohibit
a
knowing
possession,
the
naked,
knowing
possession
of
obscene
materials,
without
regard
to
the
purpose.
now
--
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
a
knowing
possession
under
this
statute,
a
knowing
possession
of
obscenity
is
prohibited
by
this
statute.
i
would
say
it
extends
to
anybody
who
has
--
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
i
would
say
so,
your
honor.
any
collector
of
obscenity
would
be
--
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
any
collector
of
obscenity
would
be
violating
this
statute.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
well,
your
honor
[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
well,
your
honor,
but
you
would
have
the
opportunity,
having
possession
of
it,
to
circulate
it,
would
you
not?
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
you
would
have
the
opportunity
to
circulate
the
obscenity.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
well,
that's
an
element
involved
in
possession,
too.
i
mean
--
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
no,
there
was
not.
however,
there
is
the
dispute
on
this
evidence.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
mr.
kearns
gave
you
some
evidence,
one-sided
in
this
case.
the
state's
evidence
was
in
direct
conflict
with
the
evidence
offered
by
the
defendant.
as
to
the
locale
of
this
material,
to
begin
with,
in
the
house,
all
of
this
obscene
material
was
found
in
her
bedroom,
along
with
a
gun
and
a
tape
recorder
and
that's
in
the
record.
now,
the
book,
the
obscene
pictures,
there
was
a
hand
penciled
drawing
of
a
very
obscene
nature,
that
was
the
state's
evidence
that
the
officers
found
all
this
in
her
bedroom.
they
came
along
and
said
the
officers
didn't
find
it
in
her
bedroom.
they
found
it
in
the
basement,
but
there
was
a
direct
conflict
on
that
and
of
course
that
was
--
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
1
would
say,
sir,
if
she,
honorable
sir,
if
she
had
acknowledged
possession,
but
the
claim
was
that
she
didn't
have
possession
of
that,
that
she
had
an
involuntary,
if
you
will,
possession
for
someone
else.
she
denied
that
she
had
possession
of
that
for
herself.
that
was
the
issue.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
yes,
i
know,
your
honor.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
that's
what
they
held.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
well,
they
held
that
in
syllabus
1,
based
upon
the
defense
evidence
alone,
your
honor.
and
i,
of
course,
mentioned
that
in
my
brief,
that
i
feel
that
the
syllabus
1
of
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
is
subject
to
criticism
on
that
score,
because
they
based
that
on
the
defense
evidence
alone.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
well,
i
know,
but
to
me,
i
mean
as
a
prosecutor,
it
was
a
jury
question,
in
view
of
the
conflict
as
to
whether
she
had
possession,
as
she
was
charged.
she
was
charged
in
the
indictment
with
possession
and
control.
now,
if
she
had
possession
for
someone
else,
she
didn't
have
control
over
that,
did
she,
in
the
sense
that
she
had
the
right
to
do
with
it
as
she
would,
if
it
belonged
to
somebody
else.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
well,
the
charge
in
the
indictment
didn't
charge
her
with
possession
as
a
bailee.
it
charged
her
with
possession
and
control.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
no.
i
believe
this
that
if
she
had
a
defense
that
this
material
was
not
in
her
possession
in
the
sense
that
it
was
packed
away
and
belonged
to
someone
else,
was
not
available
to
her.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
yes.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
in
the
basement?
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
i
don't
believe
that
the
statute
contemplates
a
conviction
under
those
circumstances.
now
that's
where,
of
course,
i
very
humbly
disagree
with
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
syllabus
1,
because
neither
the
charge
contained
in
the
indictment,
under
that
charge,
charging
her
personally
with
the
possession
and
control,
or
the
charge
of
the
court
in
instructing
the
jury
on
possession.
he
never
instructed
the
jury
that
if
they
found,
that
even
if
they
found
that
that
material
belonged
to
somebody
else
and
was
in
the
basement,
that
they
could
find
her
guilty.
there
was
no
such
instruction
by
the
court.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
depending
upon
the
type
of
possession.
here
is
a
possession
in
a
--
well,
your
honor,
i
see
what
you
mean
on
that
score,
and
there
is
no
one
that
can
doubt
the
correctness
of
the
judgment
of
a
legislature
in
prohibiting
possession
of
narcotics,
regardless
of
who
they
belong
to.
i
recognize
that
ownership
--
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
that
is
true,
but
i
believe
this,
your
honors,
that
if
the
jury
had
given
credence
to
her
evidence
that
we
might
well
have
found
her
not
guilty.
certainly,
they
couldn't
give
credence
to
both
the
state's
evidence
and
the
defense,
because
it
was
in
conflict.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
no,
whether
the
statute
--
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
all
right,
your
honor.
the
statute
--
i
thought
that
you
might
be
concerned
with
it
from
the
standpoint
that
the
argument
is
that
whether
she
had
possession
for
or
on
behalf
of
a
roomer
or
--
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
no.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
all
right,
then.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
possession
and
knowledge.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
no
and
scienter
was
proven
in
this
case.
there
was
never
any
dispute
raised
on
that
in
the
reviewing
court
that
scienter
was
not
established,
so
that
the
elements
of
the
crime
were
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
the
constitutionality
of
this
legislation,
of
course,
we
are
relying
upon
your
decision
in
the
roth
case,
in
which
a
federal
statute
providing
that
obscene,
lewd,
lascivious
or
indecent
material
is
nonmailable
and
in
the
roth
case,
mr.
justice
brennan
made
this
statement.
“implicit
in
the
history
of
the
first
amendment
is
the
rejection
of
obscenity
as
utterly
without
redeeming
social
importance.
and
we
hold
that
obscenity
is
not
within
the
area
of
constitutionally
protected
speech
or
press.”
we
believe
that
this
statute
legislating
the
--
regulating
obscenity
and
the
dissemination
of
it,
or
the
circulation
of
it
in
ohio,
is
a
proper
exercise
of
the
police
powers
of
the
state.
recognizing
that
obscenity
is
an
evil
that
has
to
be
coped
with,
and
of
course,
that
is
not
peculiar
to
the
state
of
ohio
alone.
we
believe
that
--
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
well,
i
haven't
run
down
the
statutes,
your
honor.
but
this
is
true
that
when
you
--
when
this
court
had
the
winters
case
before
it
--
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
in
the
winters
case
you
had
a
different
part
and
that
was
a
similar
statute
to
the
ohio
statute,
but
i
do
not
recall
that
it
prohibited
possession
alone.
and
the
portion
of
the
statute
that
was
under
consideration
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
particular
provision.
but
i
do
remember,
in
reading
the
winters
case
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
his
dissent
on
that
pointed
out,
among
other
statutes,
a
number
of
statutes
of
the
states
said
that
might
be
struck
down
as
a
result
of
the
decision
in
the
winters
case,
and
he
mentioned
the
ohio
statute.
however,
the
portion
that
we
have
here
--
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
well,
i
say,
the
portion
that
we
have
here
was
not
in
the
ohio
statute
at
that
time.
however,
getting
back
to
the
roth
case,
which
the
other
side,
the
defense,
completely
ignored
on
the
issue
they've
raised
here
in
connection
with
the
constitutionality
of
this
legislation.
in
the
roth
case
i
want
the
court
to
know
this
that
in
the
trial
of
this
case,
the
trial
judge
in
instructing
the
jury
on
the
test
to
be
used
to
determine
whether
this
obscene
--
whether
this
material
was
obscene,
used
the
definition
that
this
court
laid
down
in
the
roth
case
and
told
the
jury
that
the
proper
test
is
whether,
to
the
average
person,
applying
contemporary
community
standards,
the
dominant
theme
of
the
material
in
question,
when
taken
as
a
whole,
appeals
to
the
prurient
interest.
that
was
the
instruction
of
the
court.
he
followed
the
definition
that
this
court
laid
down
in
the
roth
case.
and,
getting
back
to
the
constitutionality
of
legislation
prohibiting
scienter
possession,
in
the
supreme
court's
opinion,
of
course,
in
the
dissent,
i
think
judge
herbert
discusses
the
smith
case.
and
that
case
came
to
this
court
from
california,
and
i
think
it's
distinguishable
on
the
elements
required
to
be
proven
by
our
legislation.
this
court,
in
reversing
that
case,
pointed
out
that
scienter
was
not
required,
and
that
under
those
circumstances
a
bookseller
could
not
be
held
liable,
could
not
be
held
to
examine
all
the
books
that
he
had
in
his
store
in
order
to
avoid
a
prosecution
under
that
ordinance,
but
we
do
have
the
element
of
scienter
in
our
state
statute.
i
want
--
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
absolutely
not.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
i
think
so,
mr.
justice,
because
of
course,
restricting
the
possession
of
narcotics
comes
within
the
police
power
of
the
state
to
conserve
public
health
and
--
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
it
is
within
the
police
power,
yes.
yes,
that
is
our
position.
there
is
a
distinction,
of
course,
in
the
roth
case.
the
court
was
considering
knowingly
mailing
obscene
material,
but
what
good
does
it
do
to
legislate,
to
prohibit
the
production
of
obscenity,
the
distribution
of
it,
if
ultimately
possession
is
constitutionally
protected
--
the
user
of
it,
just
as
the
user
of
narcotics.
on
the
--
the
only
other
issue
i
think
that
is
before
this
court
on
this
search
and
seizure
--
on
the
trial
of
this
case
the
two
officers
that
testified
were
already
on
the
scene
when
this
lieutenant
white
came
out
there,
ostensibly
with
a
search
warrant.
the
record
doesn't
show,
and
we
have
admitted,
and
as
the
supreme
court
held,
this
was
an
unlawful
search
insofar
as
this
particular
evidence
was
concerned,
at
least.
there
was
no
search
warrant
to
cover
it.
but
on
the
motion
to
suppress
this
evidence
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
the
court
relied
upon
the
lindway
case
in
overruling
the
motion
to
suppress
and,
of
course,
the
constitutional
provision
against
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure,
as
this
court
has
held
in
the
wolf
case,
does
not
prevent
a
state
from
offering
into
evidence.
it
doesn't
affect
the
competency
of
evidence
tending
to
establish
the
commission
of
a
crime.
now,
we're
relying
on
the
wolf
case,
too,
with
this
court
that
if
this
is
a
settled
proposition
insofar
as
the
states
rules
of
evidence
are
concerned.
it
really
is
a
judicial
rule
of
evidence,
and
ohio
does
not
follow
the
exclusionary
rule.
and
this
court
has
held
that
the
state
has
a
right
to,
and
it
is
not
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
so
admit
evidence,
even
though
obtained
without
a
search
warrant.
i
have
never
been
able
to
reconcile
that
is
not
reconcile,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
provision
in
the
constitution
against
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
and
the
competency
of
evidence
establishing
the
commission
of
a
crime
are
not
directly
related
in
this
respect
that
the
absence
of
a
search
warrant
can
be
no
defense
to
a
crime.
if
the
evidence
establishes
a
crime,
what
defense
is
there
in
the
absence
of
a
search
warrant?
it's
a
collateral
matter.
it
provides
for
a
civil
suit
for
trespass
if
that
constitutional
right
is
violated.
police
officers
are
amenable
to,
as
held
in
the
lindway
case,
and
i'm
reading
from
the
lindway
case
right
now.
“an
officer
of
the
law
who
makes
a
search
and
seizure
in
a
dwelling
or
other
premises
without
a
warrant
or
with
an
illegal
warrant
in
contravention
of
section
14,
article
i,
of
the
constitution
of
ohio
is
a
trespasser
and
amenable
to
an
action
for
such
trespass.
there
are
many
constitutional
and
statutory
safeguards
provided
for
in
the
ohio
constitution
and
the
ohio
statutes
to
ensure
that
persons
accused
of
crimes
shall
have
a
fair
and
impartial
trial,
and
those
safeguards
apply
to
matters
of
form
as
well
as
substance.
but
neither
the
laws
of
ohio
nor
the
ohio
courts
are
solicitous
to
a
person
accused
of
crime
in
concealing
the
evidence
of
their
guilt
and
under
ohio
laws
many
presumptions
are
indulged
in,
in
favor
of
accused
persons,
and
a
strong
measure
of
proof
is
required
as
to
every
material
fact
necessary
to
establish
the
guilt
of
the
accused.
but
such
indulgence
does
not
reach
to
the
extent
of
rejecting
competent
evidence
because
of
the
method
by
which
it
was
procured.
and
so,
in
the
ohio
constitution
and
under
the
ohio
laws,
the
fact
that
there
was
a
search
warrant
would
not
make
the
evidence
any
the
more
competent
or
the
fact
that
there
was
no
search
warrant
would
not
make
it
any
the
less
competent.
it
has
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
the
evidence
itself
proving
the
corpus
delicti
of
the
crime.
this
brief
amicus
curiae,
your
honors,
raises
an
issue
that
was
not
brought
up
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
in
the
trial
court,
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
issue
should
be
enlarged
upon
by
the
time
they
reach
this
court,
because
the
court
of
appeals,
for
example,
had
no
opportunity
to
pass
upon
a
comparison
of
the
statutes,
this
2905.34.
in
the
brief
amicus
curiae,
they
talk
about
2905.37
and
3767.01,
and
try
to
draw
a
comparison
trying
to
show
that
there's
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
by
reason
of
the
exemptions
in
those
other
statutes,
but
the
lower
courts
had
no
opportunity
to
consider
those
statutes
along
with
2905.34.
there
was
never
any
issue
raised
in
this
case
by
this
defense
until
we
got
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
and
agreed
to
a
brief
amicus
curiae
being
filed.
the
defense
never
claimed
that
there
was
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
2905.34
and
indeed,
it
makes
no
exceptions
to
that
statute
alone.
no
one
is
exempt,
but
in
these
other
statutes
they
talk
about
2905.37,
for
example,
sets
forth
that
druggists
in
their
legitimate
business
shall
not
be
affected
by
2905.34,
but
it
says
"in
their
legitimate
business,"
and
i
don't
think
that
under
2905.34
that
a
druggist,
even
a
druggist,
could
violate
that
provision
and
unlawfully
have
in
his
--
and
knowingly
have
in
his
possession
in
the
drugstore
obscene
material,
but
this
is
what
the
brief
amicus
curiae
raises
and
they
talk
about
the
right
of
a
person
to
read
being
violated
under
the
constitution.
well,
under
your
roth
case
you
held
that
the
constitution
doesn't
protect
obscenity
in
any
respect.
the
right
to
read
and
they
said
the
right
of
privacy,
and
that's
getting
back
to
having
books
in
your
private
library.
if
under
the
roth
case
the
constitution
doesn't
protect
the
collection
of
obscenity,
then
i
say
that
you
can't
have
them
in
your
private
library
either
or
that
there's
no
constitutional
guarantee
that
that
can
be
done.
the
--
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
i
would
not
agree,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
any
of
those
libraries
contain
any
type
of
book
such
as
the
exhibits
are
in
this
case.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
i
would
find
it
difficult
to
believe,
without
even
examining
those
university
libraries,
that
those
libraries
would
contain
what
has
been
passed
upon
by
a
jury
in
this
case
as
obscene
material.
and
if
that
were
so,
if
any
one
of
those
libraries
contained
the
obscene
books
and
pictures
and
the
hand-penciled
drawings
that
are
to
be
found
as
exhibits
in
this
case,
then
somebody
should
be
arrested.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
they
have
to
--
well
--
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
well,
i've
often
--
i
won't
say
it,
your
honor,
but
–
[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
probably
wise.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
that
is
true.
well,
[attempt
to
laughter]
of
course,
i'm
trying
to
stick
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
your
honor.
i'm
not
covering
the
whole
field
of
—[laughter]
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
it
doesn't
exempt
a
psychiatrist.
it
says
"whoever
has."
there
is
no
exemption
in
it,
so
that
—
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
who?
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
oh,
no.
i
don't
know
what
is
her
--
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
i
don't
know.
yes,
well
she
had
--
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
well,
as
a
prosecutor,
if
we
had
one
charged
with
unlawfully
and
knowingly
having
in
his
possession
and
of
course
the
element
--
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
for
scientific
purposes.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
i
believe,
mr.
justice,
that
the
law
is
directed
against
a
scienter
possession.
by
your
very
definition
in
the
roth
case,
a
scienter
possession
for
this
purpose
--
well,
i
guess
the
roth
case,
again
you
have
a
—
and
i
say
under
the
law
there
is
a
difference
between
a
lawful
and
an
unlawful
possession.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
yes.
well,
of
course
the
statute
doesn't
make
any
such
distinctions,
i
mean,
the
language
of
it.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
well,
so
far
we
haven't
had
a
decision
on
anybody
from
a
university
charged
with
unlawful
possession
of
obscene
material.
i
think
that
would
be
a
question
coming
up.
i
don't
think
that
the
law
would
sustain
a
prosecution
of
going
into
a
university
and
—
well,
who
would
you
charge
with
possession
if
it
were
in
the
library,
to
begin
with,
an
unlawful
possession,
a
personal
possession,
a
scienter
possession?
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
the
individual
who
would
have
scienter
possession,
i
don't
know
who
you
would
charge.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
i
think
it's
the
possession
for
circulation.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
no,
but
the
possession
with
the
opportunity
for
circulation.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
that's
the
reason
for
it.
[laughter]
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
that
are
obscene?
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
the
only
cases,
your
honors,
perhaps
i
should
say
that
i
didn't
cover
the
field
in
this
issue,
beyond
what
my
experience
has
been
as
a
prosecutor
in
prosecutions
brought
under
this
statute.
now
we've
had
a
number
of
them,
where
individuals
are
found
in
possession
of
obscene
material
on
their
person.
they're
perhaps
in
a
car,
a
defendant
in
a
car;
the
police
are
searching
him
for
something
else
and
they
come
upon
a
lot
of
obscene
material.
that
person
is
charged
under
this
statute.
now,
my
experience
on
it
is
limited
to
the
cases
of
the
type
where
they're
walking
around
with
the
material
and
have
an
opportunity
to
disseminate
the
contents
of
it.
i
had
cases
where
the
officers
come
upon
it
in
searching
an
individual
may
be
quite
an
amount
of
it
that
is
in
their
automobile.
now,
insofar
as
having
a
case
against
the
head
of
a
university,
i
haven't.
now,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
[attempt
to
laughter]
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
something
on
the
part
of
the
individual
that
would
bring
him
under
this
statute,
rather
than
scienter
possession
because
a
knowing
possession
of
this
obscenity
implies
at
least
a
prurient
interest,
to
use
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
roth
case.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
no,
that
doesn't
appear,
but
our
trial
court
instructed
the
jury
--
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
oh,
no,
not
if
she
knew
it
was
there,
mr.
justice.
the
evidence
established
that
she
had
scienter.
she
had
knowledge
of
the
obscenity
of
the
contents
of
it.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
not
that
she
knew
the
book
and
pictures
were
there,
that
scienter
element.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
that
is
so.
i,
of
course,
disagree
with
their
--
i
think,
because
it's
based
on
the
defense
evidence
alone,
some
of
us
might.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
no.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
no.
however,
having
tried
the
case,
and
knowing
that
it
was
a
question
on
the
weight
of
the
evidence
as
to
who
was
telling
the
truth
to
begin
with,
the
state,
the
police,
or
the
defendant,
because
there
was
a
conflict,
maybe
that's
why
i
get
the
impression
that
i
feel
that
the
syllabus
is
a
one-sided
thing
and
it
was
a
jury
question
to
begin
with.
nobody
can
say
that
the
jury
believed
her
story.
wasn't
that
a
jury
question
to
begin
with,
that
they
believed
her
story?
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
that's
in
a
separate
section.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
no,
i
said
that
2905.34
contains
no
exceptions.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
with
the
others,
yes.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
yes,
those
are
the
two
-
2905,
exempting
druggists
and
exempting
—
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
of
course,
there
wasn't
any
question
raised
in
connection
with
those
other
statutes,
as
i
said
to
you,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
any
issue
raised.
that
was
brought
up
in
the
brief
amicus
curiae
on
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
because
there
are
exceptions
in
those
other
statutes.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
they
mentioned
2905.34,
yes.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
no,
the
one
that
he
is
reading
from
—
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
that
is
true,
mr.
justice.
there
are
exceptions
in
that
other
statute
exempting
--
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
that's
the
one
–
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
yes.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
that
is
true.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
the
exceptions
in
the
other
statute
are
really
exemptions.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
that
is
in
this
respect,
now
if
i
can
get
this
clear.
you
see,
i
didn't
have
this
issue
in
the
lower
courts
at
all.
it's
coming
up
here.
there
is
a
statute
that
exempts
teachers
and
druggists
in
their
legitimate
business.
i'm
trying
to
find
the
number
here.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
it's
37,
2905.37.
i
do
not
have
the
wording
of
2905.37.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
well,
2905.37
reads
that,
sections
2905.33
to
2905.36,
which
of
course,
would
include
2905.34,
do
not
affect
teaching
in
regularly
chartered
medical
colleges,
the
publication
of
standard
medical
books,
or
regular
practitioners
of
medicine
or
druggists
in
their
legitimate
business,
nor
do
they
affect
the
publication
and
distribution
of
bona
fide
works
of
art.
well
now,
that
is
a
reasonable
classification,
in
the
sense
that
2905.34,
so
long
as
2905.34
is
not
contravened,
for
example,
it
says
a
druggist
in
his
legitimate
business.
now,
nobody
could
hold
or
argue
that
it
is
the
legitimate
business
of
a
druggist
to
knowingly
possess
obscene
materials.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
i
suppose,
your
honor.
there
are
other
provisions
in
2905.34
with
which
this
case
isn't
concerned.
we
have
one
portion
of
the
statute
under
which
she
was
charged,
and
it's
quite
a
lengthy
statute
to
begin
with,
and
it
covers
various
other
matters.
however,
i
still
say
that
this
2905.37
would
not
exempt
a
druggist
from
2905.34
if
he
knowingly
had
in
his
possession
obscene
materials.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
no,
it
would
not,
your
honor,
because
the
very
end
of
that
statute
says
"whose
demonstrated
purpose
does
not
contravene
sections
2905.06
through
2905.34."
that's
the
qualification,
there,
even
if
she
belonged
to
a
bona
fide
association
of
artists.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
even
if
she
belonged
to
the
—
if
it
was
for
the
advancement
of
art,
it
cannot
be
held
to
contravene,
i
mean,
there's
no
exemption
if
it
contravenes
2905.34.
there
were
several
other
issues
in
this
case,
such
as
that
the
sentence
of
the
court,
that
the
sentence
is
unconstitutional.
under
the
laws
of
ohio,
a
sentence
is
not
for
a
definite
term,
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
the
statute
controlling
that
is
mentioned.
for
example,
a
crime
--
a
statute
may
call
for
a
penalty
of
one
to
seven
years,
grand
larceny
calls
for
that.
the
court
doesn't
sentence
the
defendant
for
one
year
or
for
two
years
or
for
seven
years
and
they've
been
arguing
all
the
way
up
through
the
courts
of
ohio
that
this
defendant
has
been
sentenced
for
seven
years,
which
is
not
a
fact.
the
court
merely
sentences
for
an
indefinite
term.
in
other
words,
they
sentence
to
the
ohio
state
penitentiary,
sentence
to
the
ohio
state
reformatory,
or
i
sentence
you
to
the
ohio
state
reformatory
for
women,
in
this
case,
which
means
this
that
the
statute
provides
for
a
minimum
of
one
and
a
maximum
of
seven,
but
after
serving
the
minimum,
the
defendant
can
come
up
for
consideration
for
parole,
and
in
fact
may
get
out
before
the
--
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
she
has
never
served
time.
she's
been
out
on
bail.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
in
other
words,
on
a
sentence
to
the
ohio
state
reformatory
for
women
in
this
case,
the
defendant's
time
could
be
one
year
or
less
a
month;
in
other
words,
she's
put
in
eleven
months.
if
that
--
all
rests
with
the
ohio
pardon
and
parole
commission,
under
the
laws
of
ohio,
as
to
how
long
a
defendant
will
put
in
time,
that
is
except
in
first
degree
murders,
so
that
there's
nothing
cruel
and
unusual
about
the
punishment
in
this
case.
there's
a
minimum
of
a
year
and
a
maximum
of
seven.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
oh,
no.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
oh,
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
under
the
entry
of
the
court,
all
it
says
is,
“defendant
is
sentenced
to
the
ohio
state
penitentiary.”
with
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
ohio
pardon
and
parole
commission,
that
defendant
can
come
up
for
consideration
upon
the
expiration
of
the
minimum.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
there's
no
maximum
sentence.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
the
sentence
includes
that?
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
well,
of
course,
i
--
it's
been
my
impression
that
they
go
to,
for
example,
on
the
one
to
seven,
or
one
to
ten.
for
example,
we
have
an
armed
robbery;
the
penalty
on
armed
robbery
is
ten
to
twenty-five
years.
now,
under
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
ohio
pardon
and
parole
commission,
and
depending
upon
the
institution
to
which
the
defendant
goes,
for
example
the
ohio
state
reformatory
takes
offenders
up
to
thirty,
and
the
penitentiary
beyond
that,
but
if
the
man
went
to
the
penitentiary
on
an
armed
robbery
conviction
on
a
ten
to
twenty-five,
he
would
put
in
a
minimum
of
about
six
and
a
half
years
on
that
ten
to
twenty-five
before
he
could
come
up.
but
at
the
reformatory,
the
same
person
would
put
in
two
and
a
half
years
on
a
ten
to
twenty-five
before
he's
considered.
however,
there
isn't
any
showing
that
this
punishment
provided
by
this
statute
is
cruel
and
unusual.
it's
not
an
unusual.
in
fact,
it
provided
for
a
fine
or
imprisonment,
or
both.
now,
the
court
could
have
fined
her
in
addition
to
the
imprisonment
sentence.
and
they
have
been
claiming
in
the
supreme
court
and
in
this
court
that
this
woman's
sentence
that
the
court
of
appeals
refused
to
review
it
and
that
isn't
a
fact
at
all.
if
you'll
look
at
the
journal
entry
of
the
court,
the
court
of
appeals
journal
entry,
you'll
find
that
they
said,
"upon
review
of
the
entire
case"
and
this
was
one
of
the
issues,
that
her
sentence
was
cruel
and
unusual,
if
you
look
at
the
journal
entry,
they
hold
that
punishment
was
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
trial
court.
in
other
words,
that
the
court,
the
trial
court,
had
the
discretion
whether
to
give
her
imprisonment
or
just
a
fine
or
both.
so
there
was
nothing
cruel
and
unusual
in
sentencing
her.
and
that
really
was
the
--
is
to
be
concluded
from
the
journal
entry
of
the
court,
because
they
said
they
reviewed
the
entire
case.
they
didn't
refuse
to
review
the
question
of
her
sentence
at
all.
your
honors,
we
believe,
the
state
of
ohio,
that
we
have
a
right
to
rely
on
your
decision
in
the
wolf
case
and
on
your
decision
in
the
roth
case
if
there
is
anything
to
the
doctrine
of
stare
decisis
and
that
we
also
--
the
trial
court
had
a
right
to
rely
on
the
lindway
decision
in
handling
this
matter
in
the
trial
court,
because
the
lindway
decision
is
in
line
with
your
decision
in
the
wolf
case.
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
there
has
been
no
violation
of
any
constitutional
right
of
the
defendant
in
this
case
on
the
trial,
by
reason
of
there
having
been
no
proper
search
warrant.
we
feel
that
that
constitutional
provision
does
not
cancel
out
evidence
of
a
criminal
offense,
or
does
not
constitute
a
defense
to
the
commission
of
a
crime,
whether
the
evidence
is
found
upon
the
person
or
found
in
the
privacy
of
a
home.
and
i
don't
think
that
if
this
obscene
material
was
found
upon
her
on
the
street
and
in
her
possession
and
there
had
been
no
search
warrant,
that
there
would
have
been
any
difference
in
the
case.
in
other
words,
if
she
had
been
searched
on
the
street
and
all
this
obscene
material
was
found,
the
constitutional
provision
against
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
also
goes
to
the
person
as
well
as
the
home
and
the
fact
that
it
was
found
in
her
home
without
a
search
warrant
or
a
proper
one,
and
on
that
issue,
i
want
to
correct
something
that
i
just
remember
mr.
kearns
told
you,
that
the
prosecutor
promised
on
the
trial
of
this
case
that
she
produce
a
search
warrant.
that
isn't
so
at
all,
and
it's
not
even
in
the
record.
he
had
as
much
right,
if
he
doubted
that
there
was
any
--what
this
lieutenant
white
had,
he
had
as
much
right
to
bring
lieutenant
white
in
on
subpoena
as
the
state
and
it
wasn't
incumbent
on
the
state
to
offer
any
search
warrant
as
an
exhibit,
as
an
element
of
the
crime
to
be
proven.
and
that
is
why,
on
the
authority,
in
fact,
in
view
of
the
lindway
decision,
that's
why
the
court
overruled
the
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
insofar
as
the
record
is
concerned,
it
doesn't
show
any.
mr.
gertrude
bauer
mahon
there's
no
record
that
there
was
a
search
warrant.
the
two
officers
who
testified,
who
were
the
only
ones,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
find
in
the
record
who
made
this
particular
search
and
found
this
evidence.
they
talk
about
twelve
police
officers
being
there
and
surrounding
the
place
and
making
the
search.
but
the
only
officers
who
turned
up
with
this
evidence
were
sergeant
delau
and
the
patrolman
who
testified
in
this
case.
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
obtaining
a
search
warrant.
when
the
defendant
requested
--
told
them
to
get
one,
the
officers
said
they
waited
and
that
lieutenant
white
came
out
there.
they
thought
he
had
a
search
warrant.
now,
that's
what
the
record
shows.
