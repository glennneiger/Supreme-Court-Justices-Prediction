mr.
charles
j.
morris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
poses
a
question
to
the
court
as
to
whether
or
not,
a
union
and
an
employer
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(a)
(2)
as
to
the
employer
in
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
as
to
the
union
if
and
when
an
exclusive
recognition
contract
is
entered
into
absent
the
existence
of
a
majority.
such
contract
was
entered
into
in
this
case,
and
this
is
very
much
part
of
the
question
posed
to
the
court.
absent
a
dual
union
situation,
there
was
no
rival
union,
absent
union
security
provisions
or
other
forms
of
coercion
either
individual
incidents
of
coercion
or
implicit
coercion
within
the
contract
itself
and
also
absent
a
union
dominated
and
controlled
by
the
employer.
further
at
issue
in
this
case
is
that
this
contract
was
entered
into
and
was
the
settlement
of
a
strike
which
had
been
in
existence
for
more
than
a
month
and
further,
this
contract
was
entered
into
when
the
parties,
in
good
faith,
believed
that
they
are
in
fact
existed
a
majority
of
the
employees
who
had
authorized
the
union
by
signing
cards
as
their
bargaining
representative.
the
facts
of
the
case
require
us
to
go
back
to
the
fall
of
1956
at
which
time
the
international
ladies'
garment
workers'
union
was
organizing
employees
of
a
nonunion
rather
large
manufacturer
of
ladies
cashmere
sweaters
in
san
antonio,
texas.
the
organizing
was
slow,
and
the
record
will
show
that
during
the
period
of
about
10
months,
a
little
over
100
cards
were
signed.
and
during
that
period
of
time,
the
union
increased
its
strength
but
something
happened,
as
frequently
occurs
in
labor
incidents,
which
trigger
the
organizational
effort
and
that
was
the
employer
granted
a
wage
decrease
to
some
of
his
skilled
employees
and
the
knitting
department
of
his
factory.
this
triggered
a
strike
which
the
union
supported
and
backed.
during
the
period
of
--
of
the
strike,
which
lasted
for
a
little
more
than
a
month,
the
union
continued
its
organizational
efforts
and
more
employees
signed
cards
and
toward
the
end
of
that
period,
the
--
the
strike
began
on
the
27th
of
july,
1957,
you
see,
about
10
months
after
the
organizing
had
started.
toward
the
end
of
that
period,
toward
the
end
of
july,
the
union
representative
received
a
call
to
come
to
new
york.
he
did
and
took
with
him
two
of
the
employees
who
brought
the
cards
with
him
and
after
five
days
of
very
intensive
negotiations,
this
strike,
which
obviously
was
difficult
of
settlement
because
it
was
settled
at
the
very
toppish
lines
of
the
company
and
the
very
toppish
pf
lines
of
the
union.
it
was
settled
at
the
office
and
with
the
assistance
of
the
international
president,
david
dubinsky
and
the
vice
president
of
the
union.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
the
record
shows
that
the
strike
was
in
protest
of
the
reduction
in
wages.
the
union
as
such
did
not
call
the
strike
but
supported
the
strike.
the
record
does
not
show
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
the
record
neither
shows
that
it
was
spontaneous
nor
called
by
the
union,
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
it
was
supported
there
--
it
is
undisputed
that
it
was
supported
by
the
union
in
--
in
every
respect
and
continued
as
part
of
the
union's
organizational
campaign.
it
was
not
an
organizational
strike
--
strike
that.
it
was
not
a
strike
for
recognition,
certainly
in
its
inception.
there
is
a
stipulation
in
the
record
that
the
strike
was
in
protest
of
the
reduction
in
wages.
now,
as
of
the
time
toward
the
end
of
that
strike,
and
this
brings
me
to
the
next
crucial
fact
here,
toward
the
end
of
that
strike,
in
new
york,
the
union
representative
was
getting
a
running
count
of
the
cards
which
had
been
signed
up
and
at
the
point
where
it
appeared,
based
upon
representations
made
by
the
employer
as
to
the
number
of
employees
in
the
probable
unit,
at
that
point,
the
union
requested
recognition.
and
one
might
say
that
as
of
them,
it
was
a
strike
for
recognition.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
yes.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
it
--
it
was
not
only
assumed,
your
honor,
but
it
was
found
specifically
by
the
trial
examiner
that
both
parties
acted
in
good
faith
in
believing
that
a
majority
existed
at
the
time.
this
was
not
set
aside
by
the
board
or
although
the
board
held
this
fact
to
be
immaterial
whether
or
not
the
parties
did
act
in
good
faith.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
there
were
--
certainly,
those
suggestions
in
the
briefs
filed
by
the
board
in
this
case,
your
honor
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
--
and
the
suggestion
was
made
by
the
board
in
its
order.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
the
union
advised
the
employer
that
it
had
a
majority
based
on
the
numbers
shown.
the
--
the
record
shows
that
the
employer
did
not
request
an
examination
of
those
cards.
the
finding
of
the
trial
examiner,
however,
which
is
undisputed
and
furthermore
was
not
set
aside
by
the
board,
was
that
it
--
and
i'm
quoting,
“it
would
have
been
impractical
or
impossible
to
obtain
a
list
of
employees
at
that
time
because
the
strike
was
still
in
progress.”
now,
i
would
like
to
elaborate
on
that
because
this
will
present
to
your
honors
the
picture
of
what
was
occurring
both
in
san
antonio
and
new
york
at
the
time.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
the
strike
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
surely.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
yes.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
yes.
there
were
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
the
economic
consequences
were
tremendous.
there
were
120
employees
who
were
either
on
strike
or
on
layoff.
the
--
it
was
rather
difficult
to
determine
who
was
actually
layoff
as
a
result
of
no
work
because
of
the
strike
and
who
was
voluntarily
on
strike,
but
a
substantial
number
of
employees
were
on
layoff
status.
in
addition,
it
was
pointed
out
toward
the
conclusion
of
the
strike
that
the
disruption
of
production
had
been
so
great
that
the
employer
requested
of
the
union
a
waiver
as
to
certain
clauses
and
the
ultimate
contract
as
to
overtime
on
weekends
and
asked
permission
to
work
its
knitting
department
24
hours
around
the
clock
on
a
seven-day
basis
operating
on
a
four-shift
basis.
this
was
actually
done
for
the
purpose
of
getting
production
back
up
to
normal.
this
is
a
very
large
company.
i
would
call
to
your
honors'
attention.
the
record
doesn't
show
the
size
except
by
implication
and
that
is
it
purchased
in
interstate
commerce
alone
in
a
single
year
an
excess
of
$1
million
worth
of
one
item,
yarn.
it
was
a
very
large
company
and
the
interstate
--
the
interstate
features
of
it
are
evident
from
the
fact
that
it
--
the
settlement
had
to
occur
in
new
york.
the
--
but
to
carry
on
with
what
i
started
to
say,
your
honor,
about
the
inability
of
the
parties
to
produce
a
payroll
list,
it
is
impossible
to
read
this
record,
and
it
was
impossible
for
the
trial
examiner
and
it
has
been
impossible
for
the
various
board
representatives
and
the
board
itself
in
writing
on
this
case
to
determine
the
exact
number
of
people
in
the
appropriate
bargaining
unit.
the
figure
which
the
board
uses
in
its
brief
is
a
figure
from
280
to
368.
this
is
quite
a
large
spread.
it's
undisputed
that
as
of
the
time
the
strike
ended
and
the
recognition
was
granted
and
a
memorandum
agreement
on
the
30th
of
august,
1957,
the
union
had,
in
its
possession,
valid
cards,
valid
in
the
sense
has
been
employed
by
the
company
to
the
extent
of
186.
it
was
--
because
they
had
these
186
cards
that
the
parties
were
under
the
impression
that
they
did
in
fact
have
a
majority
as
of
them.
what
the
union
didn't
know
and
what
the
employer
didn't
know
and
what
the
labor
board
for
that
matter
didn't
know
until
many,
many
months
later
was
that
of
the
union's
card,
for
instance,
there
were
34
cards
as
to
employees
who
did
not
show
up
on
a
current
payroll.
now,
there's
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
those
persons
were
still
employees
of
the
company
or
not.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
the
concept
of
employee
status,
your
honor,
is
one
which
has
great
significance
in
a
union
plant
where
there
is
a
collective
bargaining
contract
which
says,
“an
employee
shall
remain
an
employee
while
on
layoff”.
in
a
nonunion
plant,
these
are
concepts
which
are
virtually
means
all
employer
does
and
i
personally
participated
in
examining
these
payroll
records.
all
this
employer
did
was
that
he
would
have
a
payroll
which
would
show
that
on
a
particular
day
or
a
particular
week,
so
many
employees
worked
but
whether
or
not
suzy
jones
was
still
an
employer
or
not
when
she
left
for
maternity
leave
--leave
or
whether
or
not
juan
garcia
was
still
an
employee
when
he
had
either
quit
or
laid
off
or
take
a
leave
of
absence
was
not
important
in
this
kind
of
factory.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
that
is
correct.
these
are
issues,
your
honor,
which
are
responsible
in
board
cases
for
taking
many,
many
months
to
decide.
and
the
record
will
show
that
as
of
the
time
of
the
trial
in
this
case,
the
employer
recognized
that
there
were
still
four
categories
in
dispute
and
the
undisputed
testimony,
however,
was
that
prior
to
that,
there
were
as
many
as
30
or
40
categories
in
dispute
as
to
whether
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
in
my
experience,
your
honor,
if
i
may
draw
in
my
experience,
it
would
have
taken
months
in
view
of
the
issues
which
were
posed.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
yes.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
your
honor,
your
honor,
it
would
have
taken
months.
for
instance,
one
large
category
of
dispute
between
the
parties,
and
there
was
dispute
here
within
the
company
itself,
was
whether
or
not
some
25
employees
who
were
hired
as
replacements
in
the
strike
were
employees
and,
hence,
would
be
counted.
it
is
undisputed
and
the
trial
examiner
so
found
that
the
top
official
of
the
company
advised
the
union
officials
in
new
york
that
these
were
temporary
employees
and
therefore,
the
trial
examiner
so
found.
however,
the
production
strike
at
the
manager
of
the
company,
the
local
manager
of
the
company
said,
“no.
we
hired
these
people
as
permanent
employees.”
this
was
the
kind
of
thing
which
could
be
determined
only
after
detailed
investigation
which
would
involve
looking
at
the
employment
records,
interviewing
perhaps
people,
determining
whether
or
not,
they
were
employees.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
as
to
your
number
one,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
can
answer,
yes.
as
a
result
of
lengthy
investigation
outside
the
record,
and
this
is
noted
incidentally
by
the
trial
examiner
in
this
case,
he
commended
the
attorneys
for
spending
so
much
time
outside
the
record
so
that
the
record
could
be
shortened.
and
looking
at
this
voluminous
record,
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
were
158
cards
on
the
crucial
date
which
means
that
28
cards
had
to
be
excluded,
and
these
28
cards
were
valid
in
every
respect
that
--
except
that
i,
who
personally
try
the
case
on
behalf
of
the
union,
was
satisfied
after
i
talked
to
the
appropriate
people
and
look
at
the
appropriate
records
that
these
persons
were
no
longer
employees
of
the
company,
and
therefore,
i
so
stipulate
it.
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
general
counsel
stipulated
with
me
as
to
a
total
of
12
cards
including
eight
cards
that
had
been
signed
before
the
strike
started
or
during
the
strike.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
yes.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
either
280
or
286,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
that
is
wrong.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
the
board
assumes
that
they
were
on
layoff.
the
record
only
shows
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
that
is
correct,
i
believe.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
186.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
laid
off
or
on
strike.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
what
the
board's
brief
fails
to
note,
your
honor,
is
that
there
was
a
stipulation
in
the
record
that
158
people
who
signed
these
cards
were
employees,
were
employees.
there
is
no
such
stipulation
nor
is
there
any
crew
passed
to
the
others
who
were
not
currently
working
for
the
company.
this
is
in
the
record,
your
honor.
and
i
--
i
believe
it's
page
60,
but
i
could
be
wrong
on
that.
the
point
that
i
illustrate
is
not
that
we
are
seeking
to
contest
the
board
finding,
we
are
not.
actually,
below
we
did
because
the
trial
examiner
had
found
not
just
that
there
was
a
majority
but
the
general
counsel
had
failed
to
sustain
his
burden
of
proof
in
showing
the
absence
of
a
majority.
he
was
unable
to
read
the
record
and
find
that
that
burden
of
proof
had
been
sustained.
we
point
this
out,
your
honor,
not
for
the
purpose
of
going
behind
the
board
finding
to
the
effect
that
there
was
not
a
majority.
we
concede
that
for
purposes
of
this
case
but
we
point
this
out
as
being
a
crucial
factor
to
show
the
existence
of
good
faith
that
the
parties
had
because
of
the
complexities
which
existed
at
the
time.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
we
assume
to
base
on
the
evidence
that
we
had,
that
we
had
in
majority.
the
employer
was
interested
in
settling
his
strike,
took
us
at
our
work
presumably
that
we
had
valid
cards,
and
the
cards
incidentally
were
valid
in
the
sense
they
--
that
they
had
all
been
signed
by
employees.
there
was
never
any
question
as
to
the
authenticity
of
those
cards.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
this
case
can
be
decided
in
either
of
two
ways
aside
from
the
remedy
portions
of
it.
one,
that
if
there
was
a
technical
unfair
labor
practice,
the
unfair
labor
practice
should
not
have
been
found
based
on
the
absence
of
a
majority
if
the
party
is
in
good
faith
and
felt
there
was
a
majority.
secondly,
we
pointed
out
that
regardless
of
the
existence
of
good
faith,
and
this
is
a
feature
which
will
be
discussed
more
in
detail
by
my
co-counsel,
mr.
glushien.
regardless
of
that,
the
act
does
not
require,
does
not
require
nor
make
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
by
the
parties
to
sign
a
contract
with
a
minority
union.
and
the
authorities
are
cited
in
great
detail
in
our
brief
to
that
effect.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
the
board's
order
ran
both
against
the
company
and
the
union
and
declared
that
contract
of
august
the
30th
to
be
null
and
void.
there
was
a
second
contract
which
i
feel
should
be
before
your
honors
as
part
of
the
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
--
presentation
of
facts.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
the
company
has
not
been
in
any
of
these
proceedings,
including
the
labor
board
proceeding
your
honor,
except
to
file
an
answer
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
an
answer
to
the
labor
board.
it
made
no
presentation.
in
fact,
and
i
think
this
certainly
supports
the
fact
that
this
is
very
much
an
enormous
length
of
transaction,
not
a
sweetheart
agreement.
the
trial
examiner
noted
in
referring
to
the
testimony
of
the
company
production
manager
that
his
demeanor
and
testimony
was
such
that
it
left
a
hint
of
suspicion
that
he
was
interested
in
having
a
finding
of
coercion
so
that
the
contract
could
be
set
aside.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
we
are
contending,
your
honor,
that
there
was
not
an
8
(a)
(2)
in
this
case
as
to
the
--
and
we
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
would
want
you
to
find
that
there
was
not
an
8
(a)
(2)
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
we
have
contested
that,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
we
have
contested
the
entire
order
here
because
we
have
suffered
as
the
result
of
the
abrogation
of
this
contract.
this
contract
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
we
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
we
--
we
think
not.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
we
think
not.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
[laughs]
your
honor
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
i
would
like
to
--
excuse
me.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
mr.
glushien
will
go
into
that
in
detail,
but
i
will
state
our
position
to
you,
your
honor.
our
position
on
that
is
that
a
contract
which
contained
such
an
exclusive
clause
as
that
would
not
serve
as
a
contract
bar
to
bar
an
election
under
section
9
procedures
to
determine
the
majority
representative.
and
in
the
event
of
such
procedures,
obviously,
the
exclusive
list
of
a
contract
falls.
we
point
out,
however,
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
to
which
itself
bars
that
kind
of
contract.
we
point
out
further
that
the
board
went
much
beyond
knocking
out
that
cause.
the
board
said
the
entire
contract
falls
of
itself
not
just
the
exclusive
feature
of
it.
although
in
their
most
recent
brief,
it
is
possible
to
draw
the
conclusion
that
they
are
now
saying
that
a
members
only
contract,
had
these
been
a
members
only
contract,
then
it
would
not
have
been
unlawful
or
a
violation
of
the
act.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
a
two-year
contract,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
what
--
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
on
the
basis
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
--
on
the
basis
of
long
board
history
under
their
contract
bar
doctrine,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
the
board
--
the
board,
your
honor,
has
held
that
a
contract
which,
for
instance,
contains
an
unlawful
union
security
clause,
will
not
bar
an
election.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
--
will
not
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
it's
lawful
but
not
protected.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
but
not
protected,
your
honor.
it
is
lawful
but
not
protected.
we
could
not,
for
instance,
require
an
employer
to
bargain
with
the
minority
representative
of
the
union
in
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(5).
this
would
not
be
a
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(5).
but
we
point
out
that
the
history,
and
this
was
certainly
recognized
by
judge
fahey
who
filed
a
dissent
below,
who
had
grown
up
with
the
statute.
he
recognized
that
you
can
have
this
kind
of
a
minority
contract
and
refuse
to
find
either
in
8
(a)
(2)
or
in
8
(a)
(1).
mr.
charles
j.
morris
i'm
not
suggesting,
your
honor,
that
if
the
entire
contract
would
be
terminated,
i
think
the
exclusive
feature
of
it
would
be
terminated
on
the
holding
of
an
election
because
on
the
holding
of
an
election
in
section
9
would
have
been
invoked
by
the
parties
--
by
the
employees.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
it
would
not
remain
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent.
we
contend
it
would
remain
the
bargaining
agent
for
its
members,
and
it
would
--
could
become
a
“members
only”
contract,
that,
your
honor,
would
be
a
different
question
that
i
think
might
have
to
turn
on
the
facts
whether
the
contract
was
separable
as
to
that
clause.
i
think
i
can
focus
this
a
little
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
that
is
correct.
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind
about
that
at
all,
your
honor.
that
--
this
--
this
in
effect
would
nullify
the
prior
contract.
this
happens
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
yes.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
that's
right.
but
this,
your
honor,
it
depends.
this
depends
on
a
discretionary
administrative
feature
of
the
act
and
not
upon
the
act
itself.
the
board
has
changed
its
rules
from
time
to
time
on
the
contract
bar
doctrine.
there
is
nothing,
there
is
nothing
there
as,
your
honor,
recognizing
the
brooks
case,
which
requires
the
majority
to
be
adhered
to.
the
majority
there
had
seized
to
exist
in
the
brooks
case.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
that's
right.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
well
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
well,
perhaps,
i
should
make
myself
clear
here.
and
i
would
refer
to
the
dissent
by
fanning,
member
fanning,
and
that
is,
if
the
contract
was
terminable
within
a
year,
it
would
be
terminable
by
the
board.
and
only
when
the
board
decided
that
this
was
the
best
thing
to
do
in
terms
of
stability
of
industrial
relations,
balancing
on
one
hand
stable
industrial
relations
and
freedom
of
choice
on
the
other.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
a
minor
--
a
minority
union
only,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
that.
i'm
saying
that
if
the
employer
is
bargaining
with
a
minority
representative
and
30%
of
the
employees
file
a
decertification
petition
or
let
us
say
the
30%
of
the
employees
bring
in
a
rival
union
and
a
--
an
election
is
held
and
the
rival
union
wins
the
election,
the
employees
then
have
asserted
themselves
under
section
9
(a),
and
under
section
8
(a)
(5),
the
employer
is
then
obligated
to
bargain
with
that
rival
union.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
no,
your
honor,
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that
it
is
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
--
undesirable.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
assuming,
assuming,
as
in
the
brooks
case,
that
the
party
--
that
the
employees
themselves
had
already
asserted
themselves
to
select,
as
a
majority,
their
representative
and
therefore,
the
12-month
period
was
presumed
and
the
employer
was
not
in
the
position
to
contest
to
that.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
i
say
the
board
could
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
i
say
the
--
the
board
could
so
find.
but
if
it
found,
it
would
be
in
its
discretion
there
as
it
applies
the
contract
bar
rule.
for
instance,
the
board
will
find
that
for
a
two-year
period
now,
even
absent
the
existence
of
a
majority,
even
absent
the
existence
of
majority,
they
will
not
permit
a
rival
union
to
come
in.but
in
the
third
year,
they
will
even
though
the
contract
on
its
face
is
a
valid
contract
for
that
third
year.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
i
--
i
think
that
this
is
the
thing
to
be
weighed
in
terms
of
the
board's
discretion
under
its
contract
bar
doctrine,
whether
or
not,
the
board
would
deem
improper
to
hold
an
election
in
the
face
of
such
a
contract
as
it
does
hold
elections
in
the
face
of
some
types
of
contract.
let
me
point
out
that
there
was
a
second
contract
in
this
case,
your
honor.
and
the
second
contract
was
signed
on
october
the
--
the
10th.
it
was
signed
after
the
union
had
secured
a
complete
majority,
63
additional
employees
had
signed
as
of
that
time.
now,
the
board
contends,
and
this
is
all
they
contend,
that
the
mere
existence
of
an
exclusive
recognition
clause
in
the
first
memorandum
of
agreement
that
this
gave
the
union
a
marked
advantage
and
therefore,
it
vitiated
anything
that
happened
beyond
that.
the
record
however
shows
that
the
general
counsel
did
not
prove
that
a
single
person
even
knew
that
the
kind
of
recognition
was
given
was
exclusive
recognition
that
people
were
simply
advised
that
the
employer
and
the
union
had
signed
a
contract,
and
this
is
all
the
record
shows,
except,
it
shows
the
contrary
of
the
--
of
the
board's
contention,
and
that
is,
of
these
63
people
who
had
signed
cards
in
the
interim,
a
number
were
called
as
witnesses.
they
were
available
to
the
board
--
to
the
general
counsel
for
cross-examination.
and
they
testified
that
they
understood,
and
they
had
been
told
by
the
employer
that
it
didn't
make
any
difference
whether
they
joined
the
union
or
didn't
join
the
union,
they
would
get
the
same
benefits
anyway.
so
63
of
them
joined
and
172
of
them
did
not
join.
the
general
counsel
stipulated
that
had
all
of
those
who
had
been
available
and
were
standing
there
ready
in
the
courtroom,
had
they
been
called,
they
would
have
testified
the
same.
they
were
not
cross-examined
on
the
point.
the
general
counsel
may
knew
effort
to
show
that
any
individual,
any
individual
was
coerced
or
restrained
as
a
result
of
the
clause
which
it
says
is
the
defective
clause
and
that
is
the
exclusive
recognition.
now,
if
the
recognition
had
not
been
an
exclusive
recognition,
would
it
have
had
any
different
effect?the
record
does
not
show
it.
your
honor
--
your
honors,
one
other
point
i
would
point
out
here.
i
will
not
go
into
detail
as
to
everything
we
have
in
our
brief
on
this
good
faith
point
except
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
is
a
common
standard
used
in
business,
used
with
contracts,
and
we
had
here
a
ratification
of
what
occurred.
we
submit
that
under
the
circumstances
of
a
strike,
which
needed
to
be
settled,
which
needed
to
be
settled
that
it
was
proper
for
the
parties
to
settle
this
with
demonstrably
improved
benefits
for
the
employees.
they
didn't
have
any
holidays
before,
they
got
three
holidays
now.
they
got
a
5%
increase.
they
got
a
health
and
welfare
fund
based
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
i
think
the
benefits
are
relevant,
your
honor.
i
won't
go
into
them
in
detail.
the
fact
that
the
--
nobody
is
aggrieved
in
this
case.
the
--
nobody
sought
not
to
take
those
benefits.
nobody,
none
of
the
employees
sought
to
go
to
the
board
to
seek
a
decertification
to
say,
“we
don't
want
to
be
represented
by
this
union,”
instead,
what
they
did,
just
as
principles
frequently
do
in
ratifying
otherwise
unauthorized
acts
of
their
agent,
what
they
did,
63
of
them
affirmed
what
the
union
had
done
on
their
behalf.
and
we
submit
that
this
character
of
designation
in
itself,
a
non-protunct
or
retroactive
designation
was
an
affirmation
of
what
had
been
done
on
their
behalf
and
an
acceptance
of
the
benefits
and
not
a
repudiation
of
the
benefits.
it
happens
in
business
all
of
the
time,
a
contract
may
be
a
voidable
contract.
it
may
be
subject
to
being
set
aside
by
one
of
the
parties.
but
if
the
party
who
could
set
it
aside
accepts
the
benefits
or
somehow
affirms
that
contract,
ratifies
it,
refuses
to
repudiate
it,
the
other
party
is
not
in
a
position
in
ordinary
common
law
situations
to
set
it
aside.
and
we
think,
your
honors,
that
here
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
from
individual
employees,
your
honor,
two
or
three
individual
employees.
and
they
filed
their
charge
--
charges
based
on
some
incidents
really
of
individual
coercion
which
were
thrown
out
by
the
trial
examiner.
the
general
counsel
didn't
even
bother
to
take
exception.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
this
initiated
it.
this
is
something
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
no.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
their
grounds
for
dissatisfaction
were
based
on
personal
things
where
they
felt
they
were
being
personally
discriminated
against.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
we
submit,
we
had
ratification,
your
honor,
and
that
this
ought
to
be
a
proper
way
to
ratify
a
contract
just
as
a
common
law
and
in
corporate
affairs,
other
forms
of
business
law.
there
can
be
this
ratification.
i
close
with
just
this
point
and
then
i
will
turn
the
argument
over
to
my
colleague,
mr.
glushien.
we
are
well
aware
of
the
implication
of
this
decision
not
just
in
terms
of
possible
unfair
labor
practices,
your
honor.
but
because
this
honorable
court
held
in
the
lincoln
mills
case
and
under
section
301
and
one
of
the
sources
of
the
federal
substantive
law
to
be
applied
is
a
law
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
what
this
court
does
here,
what
this
court
does
here
as
to
determine
whether
this
contract
is
void
or
voidable
will
have
implications
in
301
procedures,
will
have
implications
as
to
whether
or
not
this
contract
which
had
no
strike
clause
in
it,
for
instance,
could
have
been
enforced.
there
is,
before
your
honors
now,
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
a
retail
clerk's
case
involving
the
lion
dry
good
company,
after
a
13-week
strike,
a
strike
settlement
with
the
minority
union
was
signed.
efforts
were
made
under
301
to
enforce
that.
this
is
pending
on
certiorari
here
on
petition
for
certiorari.
this
is
raised
in
our
case
because
if
this
contract
was
invalid
for
all
purposes,
then
it
was
invalid
not
alone
for
unfair
labor
practice
purposes
but
for
purposes
of
enforcement
as
to
any
of
the
rights
conferred
upon
anyway.
thank
you.
