justice

may
i
ask
you?
does
that
mean
that
entitled
to
say
that
this
union
cannot
represent
the
numbers
that
actually
had
in
this
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
until
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
--
why
is
it
tainted?
ordered
to
sign
up.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
should
let
them
represent
them,
why
do
they
not
have
the
right
to
choose
the
representative
of
their
choice
insofar
as
they
are
concerned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
it
was
stated
that
it's
the
responsibility
of
the
board
to
do
that.
what
right
if
you
have
no
majority
union?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
why
i'm
talking
about
this
argument.
you
have
no
majority
but
you
do
have
a
minority
union.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
have
claimed
more
than
they
should
have,
and
they
have
apparently
avoid,
we
would
say,
provision
in
their
contract,
why
does
that
authorize
the
board
to
say
that
the
members
cannot
be
represented
by
that
union
to
the
extent
that
they
represented
them
illegally?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
will
derive,
do
you
not,
it
will
derive
it
on
my
assumption
after
it
was
the
minority,
has
been
representing
a
minority
of
the
group.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
may
well
be
but
it
may
well
be
that
they're
stating
that
for
the
reason
they
went
in.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
board
have
the
right
to
punish
the
union
for
having
quite
numbered
or
having
claimed
more
than
they
were
entitled
to
get
on
the
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
require
some
movement
on
somebody's
part,
wouldn't
it,
rather
than
putting
initials
on
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
right
does
the
board
has
if
nobody
has
complained
of,
and
no
member
of
the
union
complained
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
paid
their
dues
and
they
wanted
to
belong
and
they
wanted
to
be
represented
by
this
minority
union.
why
--
why
does
that
one
clause
in
the
contract
invalidates
the
whole
thing
so
that
the
board
can
say,
"you
can't
do
anything
at
all.
you
people
have
no
representatives?"
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
can't
have
them
unless
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
we
have
an
election
to
decide
whether
or
not
you're
a
majority.
assuming
that
if
they're
not
a
majority.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
you
obtain
it
if
you
don't
have
some
findings,
some
evidence
that
they
coerced
them
to
get
in
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
protect
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
protect
them
from
the
union
that
they
voluntarily
joined
according
to
the
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
--
why
is
that
question
raised?
but
you
were
claiming
what
the
board
found
is
that
they've
tried
to
get
more
than
they
were
entitled
during
the
contract,
it
isn't
an
exclusive
representation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
because
i
--
i
don't
quite
get
this.
maybe
--
maybe
past
cases
have
cited
what
i
will
ask
you.
what
would
be
--
have
been
the
effect
to
this
contract
if
section
2
had
not
been
in
it.
they've
said
the
numbers
of
our
union.
in
view
of
section
2
act,
not
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
talking
about
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
it
cannot
be
possible
that
if
they
had
made
this
contract,
127
men
of
a
six
men
are
non-union
had
made
it
to
six
men
that
the
board
withhold
that
the
company
wasn't
bound
to
pay
the
wages
that
it
said
it
will
pay
in
here
or
would
left
out
number
two?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
understand
--
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
assuming
to
added
number
two
is
not
bad.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
about?
would
that
be
a
good
contract
or
not
with
reference
to
the
union
members?
did
they
call
off
this
strike
and
did
they
go
back
to
work
under
the
agreement
it
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
call
off
this
drive
and
go
back
to
work?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
there
was
an
agreement
that
they
would
pay
him
$1.10
per
hour
after
60
days
and
other
payments.
have
they
paid
him
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
record
show?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
it
your
believe
that
they
couldn't
enforce
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
call
that
they
made
a
mistake,
i'm
--
i
assume
it's
--
just
what
--
what
said
here
that
they
had
one
clause
in
the
contract
that
they
want
to
represent
them
all.
although
it
did
plainly
show
that
they
were
calling
their
men
off
that
strike
by
reason
of
this
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
it
--
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
exclude
the
contract,
but
suppose
it
does,
why
does
the
board
have
to
treat
as
inseparable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
therefore,
you
can
punish
the
employees
by
depriving
them
with
the
benefits
of
--
of
this
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it's
depriving
him
of
the
benefits
of
it,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
page
is
that?
