mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
union
is
an
aggrieved
party
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
even
with
respect
to
that
part
of
the
order
that
runs
against
the
company.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
for
that
reason,
i
think
that
the
union
here
is
properly
challenging,
and
the
absence
of
the
company
itself
is
properly
challenging
both
the
order
that
runs
against
the
company
as
well
as
the
order
that
runs
against
the
union.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
do
not
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
do
--
i
do
not
--
well,
let
me
say
this
briefly
that
i
think
that
that's
merely
a
sort
of
a
precautionary
clause
that
if
they
do
have
any
rights
under
this
contract,
the
board
is
not
saying
that
they
do
have
any
rights
but
if
they
do
have
any
rights,
the
board's
order
does
not
--
does
not
bar
those
rights
in
the
employees.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
other
considerations
may
govern
that
kind
of
the
thing.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now,
before
i
turn
to
the
considerations
which
underlie
this
controversy,
i
think
i
should
like
to
emphasize
because
despite
certain
acknowledges
that
have
been
made,
nevertheless,
i
think
that
the
two
points
had
been
blur
if
not
obscure
.the
first
is
that
the
board
in
this
case
found
that
the
union
did
not
represent
a
majority
of
the
employees
that
were
covered
by
this
--
this
contract.
that
finding
was
affirmed
by
the
court
below
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
petitioners
both
in
their
brief
as
well
as
during
the
course
of
the
oral
argument
have
set
up
a
sort
of
a
variable
smokes
screen
as
to
why
the
board
was
wrong
in
making
the
calculations
that
it
did
that
they're
showing
that
it
was
a
minority
union,
nevertheless,
both
in
this
brief
and
again
in
this
court,
they
have
acknowledged,
and
i
think
this
is
the
critical
thing.
they
have
acknowledged
that
this
question
of
--
of
the
minority
status
of
this
union
is
not
now
before
this
court
for
review.
and
so
the
starting
point,
our
starting
premises
that
this
union
did
not
represent
a
majority
of
the
employees
at
the
time
that
it
was
recorded
exclusive
recognition
by
this
company.
and
secondly,
secondly,
in
the
posture
of
this
case,
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
question
of
whether
major
--
or
minority
union
can
enter
into
a
contract
for
its
members
only.
nor
are
we
concerned
with
the
suggestion
that's
been
made
here
as
well
as
in
--
in
the
briefs
of
the
parties
that
the
minority
union
may
negotiate
for
all
of
the
employees
in
their
unit
as
long
as
there
is
no
explicit
recognition
of
an
exclusive
representative
status.
now,
we
think
that
the
distinction
is
one
with
without
a
difference.
but
in
any
event,
that
is
not
this
case,
because
in
this
case,
in
this
case
the
employer
did
afford
exclusive
recognition
to
this
union,
and
it
did
negotiate
--
and
this
union
did
negotiate
a
contract
covering
all
of
the
employees
as
their
exclusive
bargain
representative
at
a
time
when
this
union
did
not
represent
a
majority
of
those
employees.
now,
as
mr.
morris
has
said,
the
two
principle
questions
that
are
presented
in
this
case
are
first,
whether
the
employers,
whether
recognition
of
a
minority
union
has
the
exclusive
representative
of
all
of
the
employees
in
the
unit
whether
that
constitutes
first
on
the
part
of
the
employer
interferes
and
restraint
with
the
exercise
of
section
7
rights
by
the
employees,
illegal
employer
support
of
a
labor
organization
in
violation
of
the
statute
and
second,
whether
it
constitutes
on
the
part
of
the
union
the
acquisition
of
this
exclusive
representative
status
when
it
does
not
represent
a
majority
employees,
whether
that
acquisition
on
the
part
of
the
union
constitutes
restraint
and
coercion
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
of
the
statute.
now,
i
think
the
starting
point
of
our
analysis
in
this
case
here
is
a
word
about
the
collective
bargaining
mechanism
of
the
statute.
the
key
feature,
the
key
feature
of
that
mechanism
is
the
majority
rule.
that
provision,
the
majority
of
rule
is
incorporating
the
statute
by
virtue
of
section
9
of
the
act
which
provides
that
only
a
representative
chosen
by
a
majority
of
the
employees
and
an
appropriate
bargaining
unit
may
serve
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
of
the
all
of
the
employees
in
the
unit,
both
the
consenting
majority
as
well
as
the
non-consenting
minority.
under
the
statute,
under
the
statute,
only
a
majority
union,
one
which
has
been
designated
by
a
majority
of
the
employees,
the
unit
has
the
plenary
authority
to
speak
for
both
the
consenting
majority
as
well
as
the
non-consenting
minority.
and
under
the
statute,
an
employer
is
obligated
to
accord
exclusive
recognition
to
a
--
an
employee
is
representative
only
if,
only
if
that
representative
has
been
chosen
by
a
majority
of
the
employees.
now,
the
majority
rule
principle
is
a
common
place
of
our
political
life,
of
course.
and
congress,
congress
adopted
this
majority
rule
principle
on
this
statute
in
order
to
import
into
the
arena
of
industrial
relations
and
measure
of
democracy
such
as
barks
aaron
political
life.
now,
consistent
with
this
philosophy,
consistent
with
this
underlying
philosophy,
we
think
that
congress
could
not
have
contemplated
that
a
minority
union,
even
in
the
absence
of
majority
representative
that
a
minority
union
could
ever,
could
ever
exercise
plenary
authority
to
represent
both
--
all
of
the
employees
in
a
unit
both
a
consenting
minority
as
well
as
the
non-consenting
majority.
indeed,
when
the
majority
rule
principle
was
adopted
by
congress,
there
was
some
concern
expressed
over
the
notion
of
putting
even
the
man
consented,
minority
under
their
control
of
the
majority,
but
congress
concluded
that
the
majority
rule
principle
gave
assurance
of
both
stability
and
workability
and
it
adopted
this
principle.
now,
it
seems
to
us,
it
seems
to
us
that
to
say
that
a
minority
union
representing
only
minority
employees
may
represent
both
the
majority
as
well
--
do
not
consenting
majority
as
well
as
the
consenting
minority,
it
is
simply
to
stand
the
majority
rule
principle
on
its
head.
now,
additional
evidence
of
the
congressional
understanding
that
the
statute
does
not
permit,
that
the
statute
does
not
permit
a
minority
union
to
serve
as
the
exclusive
representative
of
employees
in
a
unit.
it
is
furnished
by
the
1959
amendments
to
the
act.
for
some
years
prior
to
1959,
proposals
have
been
made
in
the
senate
and
congress
to
exempt
certain
industries,
among
them
the
construction
industry.
to
--
to
exempt
certain
industries
from
the
majority
rule
principle
because
the
majority
rule
principle
had
been
found
to
be
unworkable
in
those
industries
because
of
the
casual
intermittent
employment
that
obtains
in
that
industry
as
well
as
others.
these
efforts
fail
because
congress
was
unwilling
to
sacrifice
the
majority
rule
principle
even
under
the
light
of
those
considerations.
but
in
1959,
in
1959,
congress
passed
section
8
after
the
statute.
and
section
8
after
the
statute
permits
an
employer
who
is
engaged
primarily
in
the
construction
industry
to
enter
into
what
is
called,
into
what
is
called
pre-hire
agreements
with
the
union
which
either
represents
none
of
his
employees
or
a
minority
of
his
employees.
now,
the
special
dispensation
which
has
been
thus
accorded
to
the
construction
industry
and
the
legislative
history
behind
it
which
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief,
i
think
evidence,
as
the
congressional
understanding,
that
recognition,
exclusive
recognition
through
a
minority
union
is
incompatible
with
the
majority
rule
principle
of
the
statute,
and
that
in
order
to
permit
it,
in
order
to
permit
it
a
special
statutory
provision
was
required.
now,
again,
again,
further
evidence
of
the
congressional
understanding
of
what
the
majority
rule
principle
in
the
statute
means
is
to
be
found
in
the
appropriations
to
the
board's,
to
the
board
--
to
the
writers,
to
the
--
they
found
in
the
writers
to
the
board's
appropriations
from
the
years
1944
to
1948.
and
these
appropriations,
these
writers,
the
court
will
recall,
were
considered
by
this
court
last
term
in
the
bryan
case.
under
those
writers,
the
board
was
precluded,
was
precluded
from
challenging
an
agreement
between
an
employer
and
the
union,
if
that
agreement
had
been
in
effect,
had
been
in
effect
for
a
period
of
three
months
or
more
without
a
charge
having
been
filed.
now,
in
that
--
those
writers,
those
writers,
as
this
court
noted,
as
this
court
noted
in
the
bryan
case
and
the
opinion
my
mr.
justice
harlan
that,
i'm
reading
from
the
opinion,
"that
that
legislation,
these
writers
were
enacted
with
the
specific
reference
to
agreement
with
minority
unions."
and
again
dropping
to
the
footnote
on
that
page,
the
court
again
noted
the
debates,
the
debates
concerning
the
writes,
showed
that
the
issue
of
representation
by
minority
unions
was
in
the
forefront,
in
the
forefront
of
legislative
concern.
now
as
i
say
congress
by
this
--
these
writers
concluded
the
board
from
upsetting
a
contract
even
with
the
minority
union
which
had
been
in
effect
for
three
months
without
a
charge
having
been
far.
now,
if
--
if,
as
the
other
side
argues,
the
statute
would
--
permits,
permits
an
employer
to
the
court
exclusive
recognition
to
minority
union,
then
these
writers
would
have
been
unnecessary,
it
seems
to
us.
now,
here,
here,
the
employer
has
done
quite
the
reverse
of
what
we
think
the
statute
commands.
it
has
accorded
exclusive
recognition
to
a
union
which
has
not
been
designated
by
a
majority
union
and
instead
of
the
non-consenting
minority
being
placed
under
the
consenting
majority,
the
reverse
has
taken
place.
the
non-consenting
majority
has
been
put
under
the
control
of
the
minority.
now,
we
think,
we
think
that
such
recognition,
in
the
first
place,
offends
the
legislative
--
the
statutory
prohibition
against
employer's
support
of
a
labor
organization.
long
ago,
as
it
has
already
been
indicated,
long
ago
this
court
said
that
where
the
employer
accords
exclusive
recognition
to
a
union
that
recognition
gives
it
a
marked
advantage,
a
marked
advantage
in
competing
for
the
support
of
the
employees.
that
kind
of
recognition
obviously
enhances
the
prestige
of
the
union,
the
eyes
of
the
employees.
and
we
think
that
in
every
meaningful
sense,
in
every
meaningful
sense,
it
is
a
kind
of
support
which
the
statute
forbids.
now,
of
course,
it's
true,
it's
true
that
where
you
have
a
majority
union,
which
is
recognized
that
it
too
derives
some
kind
of
support
from
--
from
the
recognition
but
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this
one
here
is
that
in
the
one
case,
the
majority
union,
the
statute
requires
the
employer
to
recognize
that
union
but
here,
here,
there
is
no
statutory
sanction
for
the
support
which
a
minority
union
derives
from
having
obtained
exclusive
recognition.
now,
we
also
think,
we
also
think
that
the
board
found
in
this
case
that
an
employers
recognition
of
a
minority
union
as
an
exclusive
bargaining
representative
of
all
the
employees
also
constitutes
an
impermissible
form
of
interference
with
the
employees'
rights.
section
7
of
the
right
guarantees
to
the
employees,
among
other
things,
the
right
to
bargain
collectively
through
representatives
of
their
own
choosing
or
to
have
none
at
all.
whether
an
employer
voice
upon
him
a
non-consenting
majority,
a
union
which
they
have
neither
--
may
have
neither
wanted
nor
designated,
nor
names
him,
the
exclusive
recognition
negates
and
abridges
that
right
to
be
free,
to
be
free
of
an
unwanted
union,
to
select
their
own
bargaining
representative
or
to
have
none
at
all.
now,
it
is
argued,
it
is
argued
that
the
employer
and
the
union
in
this
case
acted
in
a
good
faith
believe
that
the
union
represented
a
majority
of
the
employees.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
shows,
the
record
shows
that
the
employer
accorded
recognition
to
this
union
as
exclusive
bargaining
representative
without
proof
either
being
demanded
or
adduced
that
the
union
represented
a
majority
of
the
employees.
and
in
fact,
the
fact
is,
the
fact
is
that
the
employer
accorded
this
union
exclusive
recognition
upon
the
unions
on
verified
claim
and
as
it
turned
out
to
be
erroneous
claim
that
it
represented
the
majority
of
the
union.
but
in
any
event,
in
any
event,
it
is
our
position
that
the
good
faith
of
the
party
is
the
good
faith
believed
that
this
union
represented
a
majority
is
an
irrelevant
consideration.
in
the
first
place,
the
statute
does
not
say
that
a
union
which
is
deemed
in
good
faith
to
represent
a
majority
of
the
employees
shall
be
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative.
the
statute
says
that
only
a
union
which
has
the
majority
--
which
has
been
designated
by
a
majority.
secondly,
secondly,
the
statute
does
not
excuse
interference
or
support
because
of
the
good
faith
of
the
parties.
what
is
unlawful,
under
the
statute,
is
the
active
support
of
the
active
interference
and
properly
so
because
whatever
the
impart
is
good
faith
may
be
whether
or
not
he
is
acting
in
good
faith,
in
either
case,
in
either
case,
the
right
of
the
employers
to
be
free
of
an
unwanted
union,
to
be
free
to
bargain
collectively
to
a
representative
of
their
own
choosing,
in
either
case,
whatever
the
employers
thinking
may
be,
that
right
is
impaired.
now,
it's
argued
that
in
this
case,
there
was
no
rival
union,
there
was
no
union
security,
there
was
no
union
security
provision
which
was
incorporated
in
this
contract,
and
finally
that
the
employer,
that
the
employer
did
not
recognize
this
union
because
he
favored
it.
there
are
--
it
is
true,
it
is
true
that
the
board
has
had
a
number
of
cases
dealing
with
--
with
recognition
of
minority
unions
and
that
the
board
in
those
cases,
beginning
as
early
as
volume
4
--
volume
5
rather,
back
in
1938,
of
its
reports,
that
the
board
has
said
wherever
the
issue
is
directly
arisen,
that
the
board
has
said
that
exclusive
recognition
of
a
minority
union
is
unlawful.
it
is
true
that
in
those
cases,
we've
had
certain
factors
like
rival
unions,
we've
had
also
the
factor
that
there
was
--
that
the
contract
gave
the
union
some
kind
of
union
security
provision.
but,
your
honor,
the
board
has
never
qualified
in
any
of
these
cases
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
in
any
of
these
cases,
the
board
has
never
said,
has
never
qualified
the
statement
that
recognition
of
a
minority
union,
when
it
does
not
represent
a
majority,
is
bad.
these
other
factors,
the
fact
that
there
was
a
rival
union
in
the
picture,
the
fact
that
the
employer
may
have
given
the
union
a
union
security
provision,
these
were
merely
factors
which
underscored,
which
underscored
the
violation.
they
were
not
necessary
to
the
violation
in
the
board's
view.
they
were
not
controlling
or
decisive,
but
they
did
underscore,
they
did
underscore
the
fact
that
the
employer,
in
those
cases
here,
had
invaded
the
employees'
rights
to
be
free
of
an
unwanted
union.

dominick
l.
manoli
yes
i
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
understand.
the
last
figure
that
i
saw,
which
is
some
years
ago,
i
have
not
seen
a
current,
one
was
about
15
million.
i'm
quite
sure
that
figure
may
be
a
little
bit
higher
today.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
something
like
that
perhaps.
i
--
i'm
just
recalling
these
figures
from
the
top
of
my
head,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
have
any
current
figures,
your
honor,
but
since
the
last
time
i
had
a
case
and
look
into
for
some
years
ago
is
about
15
million.
it
may
have
gone
up
or
lower
but
i
think
it
somewhere
on
that
neighborhood.
as
the
astronomers
say
it
would
take
a
million
less
from
what
occurred.
[laughs]
the
--
well,
as
i
was
saying
that
in
these
other
cases,
we
do
have
a
situation
where
there
are
other
--
these
other
factors
of
rival
unions,
union
security
but
those
have
merely
been
aggravating
factors,
they've
not
been
controlling
under
the
decision.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
has
been
said
here
that
there
is
no
case
in
which
the
board
has
held
that
--
that
absent
rival
unions
or
union
security
of
the
board
has
held
that
a
recognition
of
a
minority
union
as
exclusive
representative
was
bad.
but
this
was
the
heart,
this
was
the
heart
of
the
board's
position
in
the
curtis
case.
in
the
curtis
case,
there
was
no
rival
union
and
neither
was
there
--
then
the
union
wasn't
--
obviously
didn't
get
a
contract.
the
union
wasn't
--
didn't
have
a
union
security
provision
and
went
on
that.
and
as
i
say
the
heart
of
that
case,
the
board's
holding,
the
board's
holding
at
the
picketing
was
bad.
of
course,
this
court
reversed
the
board
on
that
point.
but
the
basis
of
the
board's
decision
was
that
the
union
in
demanding
exclusive
recognition
when
it
did
not
represent
a
majority
of
the
employees
that
that
was
bad.
the
--
the
exclusive
recognition
would
be
bad.
now,
this
brings
me,
i
think,
to
the
second
leg
of
this
case
and
that
is,
whether
the
union's
acquisition
of
exclusive
recognition
of
this
case
constituted
interference
or
not
interference,
constituted
restraint
or
coercion
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
of
the
statute.
now,
if
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
yes,
sir.
if
recognition
of
such
a
union
by
an
employer
constitutes
restraint
or
coercion
on
his
part,
as
we
say
it
does,
then
logically,
we
see
no
reason,
logically,
we
see
no
reason
of
why
it
is
any
less
restraint
or
coercion
on
the
part
of
the
union
in
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
which
is
the
counterpart
at
least
in
language
of
section
8
(a)
(1).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
sir,
it's
general.
now,
this
brings
me,
of
course
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
finds
that
it's
interference
restraint
and
coercion
with
rights
of
the
employees.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
think
the
board
has
singled
out
the
word
"interference",
mr.
brennan.
now,
this
brings
me
to
the
--
to
the
court
in
curtis
case.
we
don't
read
that
case
to
be
dispositive
of
the
issue
of
this
leg
and
this
aspect
of
a
case
dealing
with
the
union's
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
in
the
curtis
case,
we
were
concerned,
we
were
concerned
with
the
legality
of
the
means
used
by
the
union
to
obtain
its
objective.
the
legality
of
picketing
used
by
a
minority
union
to
obtain
exclusive
recognition,
here,
we
are
concerned
with
the
legality
of
the
object.
now,
the
legality
of
the
means
and
the
thrust
of
the
curtis
decision
was,
that
in
view
of
the
legislative
history
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
and
in
view
of
other
provisions
of
the
statute
that
when
it
--
that
insofar
--
that
with
respect
to
organizational
activity
or
picketing
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
enlarge
the
scope
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
to
reach
this
kind
of
activity
except
where
it
was
--
there
was
violence
for
the
court's
language
where
it
was
--
where
the
action
was
tinged
with
violence.
and
the
reasons
which
led
congress
to
give
that
narrow
--
that
narrow
interpretation
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
was
that
in
the
sensitive
area
of
picketing,
in
the
sensitive
area
of
picketing
and
organizational
activity
to
have
given
a
broader
scope,
to
have
given
a
broader
scope
to
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
would
have
seriously
impaired
legitimate,
would
have
seriously
impaired
peaceful
picketing
or
organizational
activity
for
legitimate
objectives.
now,
except
for
disqualification,
the
note
was
repeatedly
sounded
in
congress
that
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
was
the
counterpart
of
section
8
(a)
(1).
and
if,
as
i
have
suggested,
if
we
are
correct
in
saying
that
--
that
this
recognition
constitutes
restraint
or
coercion
upon
the
part
of
the
employer,
then
there
is
no
compelling
reason
why
it
is
any
--
why
it
should
not
also
be
held
to
be
restraint
or
coercion
upon
the
part
of
the
union.
and
the
considerations,
the
considerations
which
--
which
warned
counsel,
i
believe,
your
--
your
honors'
word
was,
which
counsel
against
an
expansive
reading
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
in
other
--
in
other
words,
the
impingement
upon
peaceful
activity,
which
might
--
which
might
invade
or
destroy
the
right
to
engage
in
peaceful
picketing
for
legitimate
objectives,
those
considerations
are
not
applicable
here
because
here,
there
is
no
danger,
no
danger
of
cutting
down
upon
legitimate
--
upon
peaceful
activity
for
legitimate
objectives.
the
invasion
of
the
employees'
rights
here
whether
it's
by
the
employer
or
by
the
union,
it's
both
immediate
and
direct,
and
it's
not
one
which
is
easily
remediable
by
an
election.
because
in
any
election,
this
union
having
already
obtained
exclusive
recognition,
enters
the
list
with
a
marked
advantage.
now,
let
me
say
finally
a
word
about
the
board's
order.
the
board's
order
requires
the
employer
to
cease
and
refrain
from
according
inclusive
recognition
of
this
union.
it
also
requires
the
union
to
refrain
from
acting
as
exclusive
bargaining
representative
until
or
unless
the
union
has
been
designated
in
a
board
election
by
a
majority
of
the
employees
as
their
bargaining
representative.
the
board's
order
also
requires
the
company
to
cease
giving
effect
to
the
october
10th
agreement.
now,
there
are
two
attacks
made
upon
this
order.
the
first
is
that
the
board's
order,
insofar
as
it
directs
the
parties
to
cease
giving
effect
to
the
october
10th
contract,
is
unwarranted,
because
it
is
asserted.
by
that
time,
the
union
had
obtained
a
majority,
had
obtained
a
majority
status.
now,
whether
or
not
the
union
did
in
fact
obtained
majority
status
by
that
day,
we
neither
challenge
it
nor
admit
it,
but
whether
or
not
they
did,
whether
or
not
they
did,
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
that
majority
status
was
achieved
after
the
union
had
derived
illegal
support
from
the
exclusive
recognition
which
a
company
had
accord
us
to
at
a
time
when
that
union
was
not
entitled
to
that.
now,
we
don't'
believe
that
any
--
we
--
it's
our
view
that
any
majority
which
the
union
may
have
had
upon
that
date
cannot
be
disentangled,
cannot
be
disentangled
from
that
illegal
support
and
that
the
board
is
entitled
to
say
it's
a
tainted
majority
and
that
until
the
union
has
demonstrated
in
a
free,
fair
and
secret
election
has
demonstrated
its
majority
represent
--
its
majority
status,
it
is
not
entitled
to
enjoy
that
contract
because
to
do
otherwise,
to
permit,
to
permit
the
union
to
enjoy
this
contract
would
be
a
tantamount
to
permitting
this
union
to
a
wrongdoing,
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
its
own
wrongdoing.
now,
the
second
--
the
second
attack
it
has
made
upon
the
board's
order
is
--
goes
something
like
this.
that
the
board's
order
here
is
too
broad
insofar
as
it
requires
the
company
to
do
anything
more
than
to
withdraw
exclusive
recognition
from
this
union,
that
in
all
other
respects,
that
contract
should
be
permitted
to
stand.
i
don't
think
this
is
the
place
to
stop
to
--
to
determine
on
whether
the
majority
rule
principle
can
be
so
easily
avoided
by
simply
having
a
contract
that
covers
the
conditions
of
employment
of
all
the
employees,
the
union
as
a
minority
union
but
by
simply
omitting
the
exclusive
recognition
that
this
is
alright
because
here,
in
any
event,
the
contract
and
the
exclusive
recognition
which
this
union
obtained
were
inseparable.
they
were
in
length.
the
union
got
this
contract
because
it
was
purporting
to
act,
because
the
employer
recognized
it
as
the
majority
--
as
the
exclusive
--
as
inclusive
representative.
and
in
fact,
it
was
not.
and
we
think
that
in
this
situation,
in
these
circumstances,
the
board
is
entitled
to
wipe
the
slate
clean,
to
wipe
the
slate
clean
of
all
legally
binding
contractual
commitments.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board's
order
--
the
board's
order
does
not
permit
this
union
to
--
to
represent
its
members
until
an
election
is
held.
that's
true.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
until
an
election
has
been
held.
it
cannot
--
under
the
board's
order,
this
union
cannot
represent
even
its
own
members.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
the
reason
for
this,
your
honor,
is
that
even
the
union's
membership,
even
the
union's
membership
is
a
tainted
one
because
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
some
of
them
may
have
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
some
of
these
people,
your
honor,
joined
before
the
illegal
support
was
given
to
them
--
given
to
this
union.
some
of
them
joined
after
the
illegal
support,
but
the
board
is
entitled
to
say
that
because
of
that
legal
support,
we
are
in
no
position
to
determine
how
many,
that
have
originally
joined
this
union
of
their
own
freewill,
have
stayed
in
there
because
of
their
own
freewill,
and
we
cannot
say
that
those
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
because
the
union
has
derived
some
benefits
support
from
the
exclusive
recognition
to
which
he
was
not
entitled.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
your
honor.
and
it
may
well
be,
it
may
well
be
that
those
people
stayed
in
that
union
only
because
this
union
got
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
because
there
is
this
great
danger,
your
honor
that
these
people
may
have
remained
in
the
union
because
the
union
got
this
illegal
support.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sometimes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
they
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
because
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sorry.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
this
order
of
the
--
the
power
of
the
board
to
enter
this
kind
of
an
order
was
recognized
by
this
court
in
united
mine
workers
case
several
terms
ago.
and
it
is
the
obligation
of
the
board,
it
is
the
obligation
of
the
board
to
see
that
these
people
choose
this
union
fairly
and
freely
in
a
secret
election
in
view
of
the
fact,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
is
considerable
danger
that
this
--
that
--
that
even
the
membership,
even
the
membership
of
this
union
is
a
tainted
one
by
virtue
of
the
illegal
support
that
were
obtained
from
the
employer.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
is
no
such
evidence,
your
honor,
but
the
--
the
board
is
entitled,
we
think,
is
entitled
to
protect
these
employees
in
a
situation
of
this
kind
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
that's
a
question
of
whether
they
have
voluntarily
joined
it
or
not.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
the
board
may
infer
from
that.
the
board
my
infer
from
that
that
many
of
these
employees
who
originally
may
have
joined
the
union
of
their
own
freewill
stayed
in
it
only
because
the
union
obtained
these
benefits
and
because
of
that,
because
of
that,
we
think
that
the
board
can
insist
that
this
union
cannot
represent
its
members
even
its
members
until
that
membership
has
been
shown
by
a
fair
and
free
election.
