well,
let
me
see,
mr.
manoli,
let
me
approach
little
differently.
with
number

in
it,
as
i
understand
that
under

order

that
paragraph

in
it?
justice
william
j.

the
recognition
provision.
with
that
in
it,
as
i
understand
it,
under
the
board's
order,
the
employer
is
free
notwithstanding
the
contract
term
is
not
expired,
the
next
day
unilaterally
the
same.

if

not
in

justice

then
the
employer
would
not
be
free
during
the
contract
terms,
unilaterally
the
same.
