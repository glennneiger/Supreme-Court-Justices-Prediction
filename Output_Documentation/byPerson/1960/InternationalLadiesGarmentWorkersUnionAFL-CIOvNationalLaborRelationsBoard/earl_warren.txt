chief
justice

was
there
any
protest
by
the
--
by
any
of
the
other
employees
before
the
august
30th
agreement?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice

warren
that's
the
october
date?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief

you
may.

mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
wonder,
mr.
--
mr.
manoli,
if
we
will
--
wouldn't
run
into
the
same
kinds
of
--
of
a
take
to
speak
of
in
a
situation
of
that
kind.
if
--
if
the
unions
could
have
bargained
for
themselves
here
but
not
for
the
others,
and
if
they
receive
these
benefits
under
this
contract
and
those
who
were
not
members
of
the
union
did
not
receive
those
benefits,
wouldn't
that
in
itself
be
a
--
a
pressure
upon
the
non-union
members
to
--
to
join
the
union
so
they
would
get
the
benefits?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
see
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
--
that
was
differentiated
from
the
illustration
that
you
made
of
ford
and
general
motors,
wouldn't
it,
because
ford
would
not
be
required
to
--
to
give
the
benefits
that
general
motors
gave.
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
this
ruling
that
you
--
you
just
mentioned,
is
that
--
is
that
just
the
board's
interpretation
of
its
powers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
manoli,
may
i
interrupt
you
just
once
more.
if
--
if
this
were
just
a
members
only
contract,
how
long
would
it
take
to
--
to
get
an
election?
