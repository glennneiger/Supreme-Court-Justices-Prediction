mr.
morris.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
am
i
correct
in
understanding
from
the
board's
opinion
on
this
question
of
numbers
that
there
were
286
persons
actually
working
in
the
unit
on
the
crucial
date,
august
30,
1957?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
there
were
120
persons
belonging
to
the
unit
who
were
laid-off.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
is
--
that
is
wrong.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
that
the
finding
the
board
has
made?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
that
were
true,
that
would
be
406,
wouldn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
alright.
now,
then,
the
union
presented
158
cards
in
--
at
new
york
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
of
those
88
that
developed
were
persons
on
the
laid-off
list,
isn't
that
true?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
the
board
then
finds
that
you
had
70
out
of
the
total
of
400
--
285
--
286
workers.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
i
understand
you
(inaudible)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
morris
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
did
i
understand
you
correctly
to
argue
that
an
exclusive
bargaining
contract
may
be
made
by
an
employer
with
a
minority
union
that
doesn't
represent
the
majority
employees?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
please,
sir?
were
they
also
told
or
does
the
record
show
that
a
contract
had
been
made
making
the
union
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
of
all
employees
in
the
unit?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
see.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
didn't
say
what
those
times
were?
