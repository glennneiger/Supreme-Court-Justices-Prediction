john
m.

the
board
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
order
and
--
excuse
me.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
just
want
to
inquire
that
the
order
--
board's
order
run
against
both
the
company
and
the
union?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
mean
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
company
isn't
up
here
though.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
impact
do
you
think
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
curtis
case
as
in
your
position?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
didn't
have
any
such
thing
as
that
in
my
mind
at
all.
curtis
held
that
the
union
could
picket
and
or
peacefully
picket
to
get
recognition
and
my
question
is
if
it
can
peacefully
picket,
why
can't
it
agree
to
be
with
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
can
try
to
get
recognition
under
curtis.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
now
the
other
position
would
be
that
the
successful
in
getting
this
to
recognition
is
something
bad,
that's
what
i'm
wondering.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
