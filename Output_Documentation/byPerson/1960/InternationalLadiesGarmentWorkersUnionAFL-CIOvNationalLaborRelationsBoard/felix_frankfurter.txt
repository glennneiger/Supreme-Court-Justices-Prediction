can
you

the

asked

deal

problem
like
that

be
sure
what
the
motive

what
the

of
the

was
is
to
sheer
speculation,
so
far
as
i'm
concerned.
good
faith
doesn't
mean
much.
of
course,
he
was
good

he
wanted
to
settle
the

on
--
on
terms
that
are
not
obviously,
he
and
his
or
--
or
improper
from

there's
good

is
that
very
relevant
to

how
can
the

could
the
--
could
the
contract
be
valid
as
to
the
employer
and
invalid
as
to
the
employee?
justice

alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
it's
quite
a
wonderful
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
this
a
one
year
or
two-year
contract?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
are
you
suggesting
that
the
contract
is
valid,
free
from
any
infirmities,
perfectly
lawfully
entered
upon
for
two
years,
then
it's
terminable
if
it
is
found
that,
say,
within
a
year,
the
--
there
is
a
majority
of
the
union?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you're
suggesting?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
on
what
basis
do
you
suggest
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
a
year.
i
thought
contract
had
to
run
through
--
for
a
year
at
least
under
their
--
a
valid
--
even
though
there
is
a
change
in
the
majority,
the
contract
has
to
--
there
can't
be
a
reconsideration
for
a
year,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
but
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
said
unlawful.
but
the
starting
point
of
this
discussion
that
this
is
lawful
from
your
point
of
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
to
be
terminated
in
six
months.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
different
question,
but
i'm
--
i'm
worrying
about
the
consequences
if
you
do
find
it
a
lawful
contract
and
you
suggest
it
can
be
terminated
prematurely
i.e.
before
the
term
has
run
--
before
the
term
of
the
contract
has
run.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
under
this
contract,
under
the
contract
from
which
you
are
contending,
the
validity
for
which
you
are
contending,
for
which
you
are
contending,
the
union
becomes
the
bargaining
agency,
does
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
if
then
you
are
right
that
if
this
is
terminated
before
the
year
is
up,
then
it
couldn't
remain
the
bargaining
unit,
is
that
right
too?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
suppose
--
suppose
than
further
to
complicate
it,
i
--
i
just
want
to
see
what
the
consequences
are.
i
--
i
have
(inaudible)
do
on
any
aspect
of
this
case.
supposed
in
the
meantime
a
rival
union
comes
in
and
the
rival
union
comes
out
of
the
majority,
the
rival
unions
and
the
majority
unions
would
have
to
become
the
sole
bargaining
agent,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
point,
it
would
nullify
although
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
although
we
start
with
a
proposition
that
a
valid
contract,
the
contract
free
from
any
illegality,
any
infirmity,
any
prohibition
or
proscription
of
qualification
of
the
labor
act
when
entered
into
is
terminated
within
the
year,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
my
--
that's
the
starting
point
of
my
thinking
on
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
a
--
a
minority
can
continue
--
must
continue
for
reasons
given
there,
very
good
reason
in
industrial
relations
that
you
don't
want
to
have
a
change
within
the
year.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
in
this
situation,
you
do.
you
can't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
have
a
change
within
the
year.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
telling
me
that
the
board
can
terminate
within
the
year
although
it
says
it
again
good
industrial
relation
that
shouldn't
be
terminated
within
the
year?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
thought
the
whole
--
you
can
correct
me,
but
i
thought
the
whole
theory
was
that
it
is
undesirable
from
the
point
of
view
of
peaceful
industrial
relation
to
bring
into
question
who
is
the
majority
within
the
year.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
not
saying
you
suggested
that,
but
i
understood
that
could
be
the
policy
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
thinking
of
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
you
are
saying
now
is
that
since
here,
the
contract
that
came
into
being
wasn't
validated
by
a
majority
vote
if
it's
proven
within
the
year
that
the
majority
is
against
what
was
lawfully
entered
into,
that's
a
different
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
bears
on
--
that
bears
on
your
whole
theory
of
this
case
though.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
that
the
whole
point
is
the
gravity
of
the
period
during
which
you
do
not
want
to
unsettle
industrial
or
that
stabilizes
industrial
relation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
as
i
understand,
the
doctrine
of
theory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
kind
of
thing
i
can
understand.
but
you're
now
saying
the
opposite.
i'm
not
saying
you
are
saying
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
any
of
that
relevant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
these
individuals
say
"we
want
to
forego
these
benefits"?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
evidently
asked
some
other
ground
for
dissatisfaction,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
i'm
suggesting
that
the
intrinsic
benefit
or
make
ends
to
the
all
relations
of
the
contract
doesn't
seem
to
be
very
relevant?
and
the
ratification,
of
course,
implies
that
you
have
the
majority,
you
have
that,
there's
no
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
neither
mr.
morris
nor
you
thus
far
has
dealt,
at
least
to
my
hearing,
adequately
with
the
real
ground
of
the
court's
opinion
below,
namely,
that
no
appropriate
or
relevant
steps
were
taken
to
find
out
whether
this
union
did
represent
a
majority
of
its
union.
mr.
morris
has
made
exclusively
clear
that
many
of
the
members
are
subject
to
controversy
and
it's
time
to
find
out
etcetera.
but
the
burden,
the
gravamen
of
the
opinion
below
is
that
no
step
was
taken
at
all.
this
was
just
seemed
to
be
a
good
way
of
settling
the
strike.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
paraphrased
it
as
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
the
court
below
did
say
no
adequate
step
was
taken,
you
can't
have
good
faith
unless
you
find
out
what
it
is
your
good
faith
is
directed
towards.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
mean
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
if
you
really
mean
by
good
faith,
there
was
no
evil
motive,
why,
of
course.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
irrelevant
to
the
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
regional
director,
who?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
the
employer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
not
--
i
have
no
view
except
what
i
get
from
having
read
the
opinion
below.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
is
that
neither
mr.
morris
nor
you
have
adequately
thus
far
addressed
to
yourselves
to
what
i
take
to
be
the
driving
thought
of
mr.
justice
burton's
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
follow
that
because
you
have
a
right
to
picket,
that
the
other
provisions
of
the
act,
if
there'd
be
other
provisions
of
the
act,
can
we
just
regard
it?
the
right
to
picket
means
the
right
to
picket
and
by
picketing
get
a
majority
but
it
doesn't
mean
the
right
to
picket
and
not
have
a
majority
and
become
the
exclusive
agency.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
get
the
logic
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
anybody
can
picket.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
an
employee
of
anybody.
an
alien
--
a
whole
down
related
union
can
picket.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
far
--
so
far
as
the
act
goes,
can't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
glushien,
will
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
please
--
the
proviso
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
proviso
in
the
--
i'm
looking
at
page
9
of
the
order
appeal,
provided
that
nothing,
as
you
had
just
stated,
shall
require
the
company
to
bear
or
abandon,
and
it
engaged
under
the
contract,
but
the
last
clause
or
to
prejudice
gives
assertion
by
employees
of
any
rights
they
may
have
thereunder.
mr.
manoli
didn't
tell
me
what
that
means
but
i
should
aid
it
if
i
had
to
rely
on
my
instant
reading
of
it,
i
should
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice

that
to
include
their
right
to
insist
on
what
they
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

that
i
saw
--
read
the
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
yourself
said
that
the
exclusive
provision
can
be
exercised
living
the
rest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i
understand
that.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
i
read
the
last
clause
to
be
precisely
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
are
asking
this
court
to
allow
a
contract
which
is
--
which
is
violative
of
the
act
in
--
in
its
key
feature
to
--
or
in
a
feature,
exclusive
feature.
i
want
to
avoid
conflict
because
none
of
it
is
in
my
mind.
you're
asking
this
court
to
do
precisely
what
i
read
the
board
to
have
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that
their
contract
is,
we
would
say
that
can't
be
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
contract
cases
that
can't
be
done,
we
can
put
aside
those
contract
cases
soak
in
the
board.
justice

before
you
embarked
on
your
main
argument,
would
you
also,
in
the
interest
of
time,
take
out
this
last
question

conclusion,
what

your

justice
felix

mr.
manoli,
before
your
proceed,
as
appendant
to
justice
black's
question
before
recess
and
after
this
here,
would
you
be
good
enough
to
turn
at
page
94
of
the
record,
the
second
paragraph,
instead
of
what
is
now
two,
i'd
like
to
put
to
you
this
supposition.
suppose
instead
of
the
present
one,
there
was
a
recital
which
read
as
follow
--
what
we
read
as
follows,
"the
union
representative
has
been
designated
as
bargaining
representative
by
a
majority
of
the
employees
of
the
production
and
shipping
employees.
the
employer
without
accepting
this
representation,
either
denying
or
agreeing
with
it,
designed
to
settled
a
disastrous
strike,
poses
the
following
basis
for
settlement,"
and
then
go
on
with
one
--
the
--
the
rest
of
it
and
at
the
end
of
it,
accepting
on
behalf
of
the
international
ladies'
garment
workers
by
(inaudible),
that
have
been
alright?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
was
only
setting
out
in
second
clause
of
what
is
now
two
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
leave
the
rest
standing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do
not
leave
out
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
omit
as
he
leaves.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
of
--
not
all
of
two.
the
second
clause,
after
the
semicolon,
had
put
a
period
after
the
semicolon,
shipping
employees.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
cut
out
the
second
--
the
--
the
following
clause.
does
you
mean
that,
any
employer
recognizes
the
union,
the
union
represents
but
then
i'd
make
a
disavowal
that
the
employer
doesn't
know
if
it's
correct
or
incorrect.
he
either
accepts
or
rejects
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
my
--
in
my
proposal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
have
any
ambiguity
except
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
--
you
might
--
are
you
saying
that
as
a
matter
of
law
my
rephrasing
would
amount
to
recognizing
it
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent?
has
i
used
language
whereby
i
do
not
make
any
such
assertion
or
make
any
such
commitment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand.
justice
felix

i
know
i'm
not
a
good
draftsman

i
do

that's
right.

wants
to
take
advantage
i
understood.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
any
of
those
things.
they're
all
in
your
mind.
suppose
i'd
make
a
further
disavow.
and
in
no
--
i
--
i
make
the
union
represents
this,
the
employer
neither
accept
--
neither
accepts
nor
rejects
it,
but
decide
to
settle
a
--
a
disastrous
strike
and
therefore
offered
the
following
to
all
employees.
now,
you
said
that
as
a
matter
law,
that
in
--
that
would
make
the
union
be
the
exclusive
bargaining
authority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
not
mean
--
binding
means,
they
didn't
have
to
accept
it,
he
could
make
a
final
agreement
with
anybody
else?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
meant
to
convey
all
that,
and
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
don't
get
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
alright.
in
other
words,
you
do
not
--
the
board
does
not
here
contend
that
the
employer
cannot
make
in
the
absence
of
the
existence
of
any
exclusive
bargaining
agency
either
designated
by
the
board
or
agreed
to
be
in
existence
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
is
a
majority
by
taking
care
of
all
the
--
all
the
elements,
the
nonexistence
either
authenticated
or
in
fact
of
a
majority
that
can
speak
for
the
union,
for
this
matter,
the
employer
can
make
an
agreement
with
anybody
who
represents
anybody
either
a
single
individual
himself
or
representing
incorporate
or
a
union
speaking
for
less
than
the
designated
job.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
of
course.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
couldn't
--
he
couldn't
get
the
employees
or
not
members
of
the
union
with
benefits
that
he's
offering.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
may
i
ask
a
further
question,
about
the
question
who
along
--
regarding
the
subject
that
justice
black
raised.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
you
answered
as
you
did
why
shouldn't
it
--
what
is
the
reason
why
the
terms,
the
provisions
of
this
contract
couldn't
be
enforceable
to
those
because
the
members
of
the
union
even
assuming
they're
still
merely
a
minority
of
the
--
member
of
the
employee.
i
--
i
quite
follow
your
tainted
momentum
of
--
of
recognize
--
recognition
and
all
that.
but
why,
is
it
because,
for
all
one
knows,
some
people
would
rather
state
out
on
strike
in
other
month
--
in
other
month
on
a
--
on
a
theory
that
a
successful
or
disastrous
strike
that
the
employer
may
use
to
there
advantage.
is
it
that
the
momentum
of
this
agreement
in
itself
leads
them
to
throwing
their
(inaudible)
and
say,
“oh,
what's
the
use?”
they've
now
the
--
this
--
this
union
is
going
to
be
it?are
those
the
considerations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
talk
to
the
exclusive
--
to
the
validity
of
the
exclusive
features.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
talking
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
the
continuing
validity
of
the
--
of
--
of
all
provisions
other
than
the
exclusive
permission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
--
as
to
own
its
membership,
it
could
have
obtained
an
agreement
with
all
those
provisions
if
it
has
not
professed
to
the
extent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
last
statement
gets
down
to
a
little
more
concreteness
with
the
problem
that's
put
to
you.
you
are
not
suggesting
that
--
that
the
company
could
recover
past
payments.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
suggesting
that
they
couldn't
--
are
you
--
are
you
implying
that
they
couldn't,
the
next
day,
make
a
--
the
identical
contract
limited
to
the
members?
the
next
day,
suppose
they
just
say,
“this
contract
is
no
good
for
the
reasons
indicated
but
it's
tied
up
with
the
--
an
illegal
starting
point
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we
now
make
an
agreement
limited
to
the
members,"
would
that
be
alright
the
next
day?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
when
you
talk
about
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
could
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
they
can't
make
any
agreement
as
to
the
way
as
they
paid
them
until
there
is
an
election?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
they
make
it
individually
with
every
member?
could
they
just
enumerate
123
men?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
practically
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
every
provision
of
this
contract
could
renew
to
the
benefit
of
the
members,
couldn't
it?
the
very
terms
of
your
proviso
provides
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
let's
go
back
to
nine.
what
does
nine
say?
it
doesn't
prevent
the
--
the
employers
from
doing
exactly
what
the
contract
implies
without
having
the
union
speak
for
them,
isn't
that
right?
where
is
that
provision,
the
proviso?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
prejudice
the
assertion
by
employees
of
any
right
may
have
thereunder.
now,
could
it
--
couldn't
the
employer
say,
“no,
the
union
can't
speak
for
you
but
you
can
speak
for
yourself,”
and
the
following
123,
168
whatever
the
number
is,
will
have
the
following
--
their
working
conditions
and
wages.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
so
that
practically,
we
are
talking
by
a
lot
of
abstract
question,
aren't
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
short,
what
you
are
saying
is,
if
i
understand
your
argument,
that
this
court
has
again
and
again
and
again,
three
against,
and
i
think
at
least
three,
the
are
more
decisions
into
that,
spoking
severely
against
utilizing
a
minority
union
as
the
spokesman
for
the
union
because
it
gives
the
minority
by
recognition
of
the
union
to
which
it
isn't
entitled,
a
momentum
to
which
it
is
not
entitled.
that's
the
essence
of
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
now
that
--
when
you
say
if
there
are
no
complication
and
how
many
cases
are
there
complications?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
industrial
workers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you
very
much.
