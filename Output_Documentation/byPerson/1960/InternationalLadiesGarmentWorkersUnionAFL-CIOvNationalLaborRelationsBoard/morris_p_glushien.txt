mr.
morris
p.
glushien
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
ought
to
be
added
as
to
the
facts
emphasized
that
the
contract
in
this
case
did
not
have
any
union
security
clause
of
any
kind
and
therefore,
no
employees
were
obligated
or
required
to
join
the
union.
also
that
there
was
no
rival
union
in
the
picture
and
finally
that
there
is
no
possible
contention
that
the
union
in
question
here
was
in
anyway
a
dominated
union.
to
the
contrary,
the
evidence
shows
very
clearly
that
this
was
a
genuine
arm's
length
transaction,
and
that
the
employer
had
been
a
bitter
opponent
of
the
union
until
the
strike
and
the
settlement
which
ensued.
i
think
that
some
of
the
nutty
questions
which
have
been
imposed
here
may
perhaps
be
obviated
all
together.
if
we
look
at
one
further
factual
point,
which
mr.
morris
has
to
some
degree
gone
into
but
which
i
would
like
to
emphasize
a
little
more.
on
august
the
30th,
the
strike
settlement
memorandum
was
signed.
this
appears
in
the
record
and
it's
just
a
very
short
document
in
which
i
had
in
hand
and
brought
and
it
was
provided
in
that
document
that
within
two
weeks,
counsel
would
get
together
and
sign
a
formal
agreement.
now,
this
--
the
first
document,
the
august
30th
document,
contained
in
very
brief
and
summary
form
a
statement
"5%
increase
for
the
holidays
and
the
other
benefits"
and
one
of
the
clauses
said
"exclusive
recognition
of
the
production
and
shipping
employee".
between
august
the
30th
and
october
10th,
which
is
more
than
the
two-weeks
counsel
had
anticipated,
they
finally
got
together
and
signed
the
formal
agreement.
but
in
that
period
of
some
six
weeks,
i
guess,
the
union
continued
its
organization
campaigns.
as
mr.
morris
indicated
to
you,
workers
knew
and
were
told
that
it
was
stipulated
in
this
record
that
they
were
under
no
coercion
to
join
the
union
at
that
point.
it
was
stipulated
that
they
were
told
they
would
get
the
same
benefits
whether
they
did
or
did
not
join
the
union
and
there
is
a
stipulation
in
the
record
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
your
honor,
the
correct
answer
to
that,
i
think,
is
that
they
were
all
told
that
a
contract
had
been
signed
but
not
the
last
part
you're
talking
about.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
and
all
the
employees
knew
the
union
and
the
company
had
settled
the
strike
by
making
a
contract.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
no,
and
i
think
it's
a
pretty
fair
implication,
nobody
in
the
--
of
the
mexican-americans
they
would
have
known
what
exclusive
matter
that
they
have
been
told,
but
the
record
does
not
show
that
they
were
told
anything
of
a
kind.
now
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
not
at
all
except,
mr.
justice
warren,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
this
was
a
divided
plant
of
a
certain
large
number
of
workers
who
had
continued
to
work
while
the
strike
is
going
on.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
and
a
certain
large
number
was
going
out,
but
there
was
no
protest
shown
by
this
record
to
answer
your
specific
question.
now,
by
august
--
by
october
the
10th,
there
is
no
dispute,
i
don't
think
the
labor
board
claims
that
the
union
didn't
have
a
majority.
the
record
shows
clearly
at
that
point
by
a
stipulation
that
means,
which
you
will
find
in
the
record,
that
the
union,
by
that
time,
in
this
doing,
had
a
clear
majority
in
by
all
the
hindsight
and
the
retroactive
research
that
was
later
done.
the
october
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
the
october
date.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
and
on
october
the
10th,
when
they
signed
this
more
elaborate
and
formal
contract
which
i
had
in
handwriting.
there
is
also
a
clause
for
exclusive
recognition
with
a
more
--
with
a
similar
elaboration
of
the
wage
terms
and
all
the
other
customary
collective
bargaining
terms.
now,
the
--
i
say
that
the
whole
case
may
conceivably
be
disposed
of
on
the
october
10th
contract
for
this
simple
reason.
if,
by
that
time,
the
union
did
have
an
uncoerced
majority,
i
don't
think
it's
a
sufficient
answer
to
do
what
the
board
does
in
its
brief
to
say,
“well,
anybody
knows,
that's
just
a
tainted
fruit
of
the
original
august
30th
contract.”
that's
how
they
got
their
majority.
the
fact
is
that
the
board
in
its
decision
by
the
way
didn't
even
discuss
the
october
10th
agreement.
it
did,
in
its
order,
knock
it
out,
but
it
didn't
have
the
slightest
word
of
discussion
about
the
contract,
how
it
came
about,
whether
it
was
free
or
unfree.
the
board
in
its
decision,
in
its
brief
now
says,
“well,
you
held,
the
supreme
court
held
in
the
pennsylvania
greyhound
case,
back
20
odd
years
ago,
that
a
union
which
gets
exclusive
recognition
as
a
marked
advantage
over
any
of
it
in
obtaining
the
allegiance
of
the
employees.
what
the
labor
board
does
intent,
however,
is
this.
first
of
all,
in
the
pennsylvania
greyhound
case,
you
had
a
completely
dominated
union,
and
you
had
a
rival
union
situation
which
you
don't
have
here.
and
there
was
a
fight
going
on.
the
real
authority,
which
i
think
points
to
the
correct
result,
is
the
consolidated
edison
case,
which
this
court
decided
a
few
years
later
and
which
much
more
clearly
points
to
the
result
here.
in
the
consolidated
edison
case,
the
court
was
cited
to
pennsylvania
greyhound,
rejected
it
as
an
authority
and
the
consolidated
edison,
you
find
essentially
this.
there,
the
contract
on
its
face,
it
is
true,
said
that
it
was
a
contract
for
its
members.
the
--
the
recognition
clause
said
that.
and
to
that
extent,
it's
different
from
our
case.
but
the
economic
terms
was
stated
to
apply
to
everybody
in
the
plan.
the
contract
there
said
so.
in
that
case,
the
employer
was
engaged
in
a
rival
union
--
was
in
the
middle
of
a
rival
union
fight.
he
favored
this
ibew
union,
the
afl
union
over
the
cio
union.
he
engaged
in
various
acts
of
discrimination.
he
engaged
in
--
in
conduct
which
was
later
found
to
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
nevertheless,
when
the
labor
board
issued
its
order
which
set
aside
the
ibew
contract,
well,
i
forgot
--
i
should
have
added
one
other
thing.
the
--
the
testimony
in
that
case
showed
in
the
findings
were,
that
although
in
terms
it
stated
it
was
a
“members
only”
agreement
so
far
as
recognition
was
concerned,
the
finding
of
the
board
was
that
in
fact
it
was
an
exclusive
recognition
contract
that
it
had
been
so
applied
and
so
carried
on,
and
the
supreme
court
held
the
board
was
wrong
in
setting
aside
such
an
agreement,
that
this
agreement
was
not
the
fruit
of
the
unfair
labor
practices
and
could
not
be
presumed
to
be
the
fruit
of
the
unfair
labor
practices.
that
the
30,000
people
in
that
case
who
had
selected
the
ibew
had
some
rights
and
some
right
stability
of
employment
relations,
and
that
despite
the
employer's
unfair
labor
practices
and
despite
the
rival
union
situation,
that
contract
should
stand
and
not
be
set
aside
while
the
board
took
its
time
in
running
a
long
continued
election.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
i
don't
think
that's
a
fair
statement
of
what
the
court
below
held.
i
think
the
court
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
well,
i
think
the
court
below
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
well,
i
don't
think
the
court
below
challenged
the
finding
of
good
faith
as
such
but
did
say
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
well,
the
party
is
in
new
york.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
now,
the
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
record
does
show
that
mr.
(inaudible),
union's
regional
director
had
a
count
of
the
cards
and
had
a
count
of
what
the
payrolls
were,
and
had
--
had
a
running
count
of
the
--
the
--
we
call
it
a
head
count,
of
the
people
in
the
plant
and
believed
on
that
basis.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
the
union's
regional
director.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
i
--
well,
the
--
the
employer
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
oh,
what
i
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
well,
may
i
answer
it
this
way.
that
the
trial
examiner
believed
that
good
faith
meant
that
they
had,
from
the
information
at
hand
at
that
time,
a
reasonable
and
honest
belief
that
there
was
a
majority.
the
record
does
show
that
mr.
(inaudible),
the
union's
regional
director,
knew
the
number
of
people
for
whom
he
had
cards
and
knew
the
company
statement
of
how
many
people
there
were
in
the
plant.
and
based
upon
one
against
the
other,
he
thought
that
one
was
more
than
one
half
of
the
total.
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
the
company
and
the
union
got
together
and
signed
the
contract.
now,
i
--
i
want
to
add
this,
that
quite
apart
from
anything
else,
we
think
that
the
word
"exclusive"
in
that
agreement
had
no
--
in
the
first
memorandum,
the
august
30th
memorandum,
had
no
real
effect
upon
the
realities
of
the
employment
relations
in
this
plant.
as
we
read
the
board
decision
originally,
although
i
think
the
board
brief
is
now
otherwise,
we
felt
the
board
decision
meant
that
it
was
attacking
all
minority
union
bargaining
that
it
was
improper
to
have
minority
union
bargaining.
and
i
would
appreciate
it
if
the
court
would
ask
mr.
manoli
what
position
of
the
board
really
is
because
in
the
board
brief
now,
as
we
read
it,
they
say
the
only
attack
here
is
upon
that
clause,
the
exclusive
clause
and
the
only
real
penalty
that
will
ensue
say
they
chopped
out
the
clause,
the
board's
order
means
nothing
more
than
that
--
that
clause
should
be
chopped
out.
i
want
to
come
to
the
order
at
the
tail
of
my
argument,
but
the
board's
order,
may
i
say
at
this
point,
goes
way
beyond
merely
knocking
out
the
exclusive
clause
but
terminates
the
entire
contract
and
leaves
the
employees
without
any
contractual
protection.
we
--
we
go
through
in
our
brief
in
some
detail
to
show
that
minority
union
bargaining,
certainly,
without
an
exclusive
clause,
is
certainly
within
the
contemplation
of
the
protection
of
the
act
that
congress
intended
that
it
exist
and
that
historically,
minority
union
bargaining
was
perhaps
the
prevailing
kind
of
bargaining
in
big
industry
at
least
for
a
number
of
years
following
the
passage
of
the
wagner
act.
that
in
auto
and
in
steel
and
in
rubber
and
other
big
industries,
it
took
time
before
unions
were
able
to
secure
majorities
and
during
that
period,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
minority
bargaining.
and
we
also
say
that
it
is
essential
to
protect
that
right
to
minority
union
bargaining
because
otherwise,
you
may
have
strikes
and
considered
activities
by
workers
who
have
not
yet
secured
a
majority.
and
if
they
cannot
settle
their
disputes
and
settle
their
strikes
and
be
protected
against
discrimination
while
they
are
still
a
minority,
i
think
we
have
a
very
serious
en
route
upon
the
rights
guaranteed
in
section
7
of
the
act.
we
think
it
is
certainly
more
desirable
that
employment
terms
be
fixed
in
a
plant
by
two,
three,
five
or
any
number
of
--
of
employees
less
than
a
half
with
the
employer
through
genuine
arm's
length
bargaining,
then
to
have
the
employer
do
it
unilaterally
in
a
way
which
stated
the
wagner
repeatedly
referred
to
in
his
--
in
the
record
when
the
wagner
act
was
first
passed
as
the
trade
name
for
exploitation.
and
therefore,
we
think
that
minorities
do
have
the
right
to
fix
the
terms
of
the
bargain
so
long
as
there
is
no
union
security
clause
because
the
statute
does
expressly,
in
section
8
(a)
(3),
prohibit
a
union
security
clause
by
a
less
majority
group.
but
absent
that
and
absent
a
rival
union
situation
where
the
employer
is
applying
this
better
treatment
to
one
as
against
the
other,
and
absent
a
creature
of
the
company
kind
of
union,
we
think
it
is
perfectly
proper
to
have
minority
union
bargaining.
and
while
the
board
in
this
case
may
or
may
not
attack
it,
we
think
that
in
any
event,
this
court
ought
to
make
very
clear
that
this
is
proper.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
i
think
that
this
court
would
have
to
go
beyond
--
well,
may
i
answer
you
this
way,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
before
what
about
the
order
against
the
company?
doesn't
that
order
stand
up
in
any
event?
it
has
long
been
held
since
consolidated
edison
that
a
union
which
is
not
a
main
defendant,
so
to
speak,
or
respondent,
still
has
a
right
to
come
in
when
a
charge
is
filed
or
complained
or
issued
against
the
company
involving
the
union's
rights
under
a
contract
and
defend
independently
because
its
rights,
if
sustained,
are
--
would
result
in
the
dismissal
of
the
complaint
against
the
company.
and
i
think
our
position
here
to
make
it
amply
clear
is
that
the
entire
order
ought
to
be
vacated
and
that
so
far
as
the
complaint
against
the
company
under
8
(a)
(2)
is
concerned,
that
too
has
to
be
reversed
to
make
our
position
meaningful.
now,
mr.
justice
harlan,
to
answer
your
question,
i
think
to
the
extent
that
--
so
far
--
if
our
only
relief
here
were
--
would
be
to
just
vacate
the
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
order
against
the
union
but
to
leave
--
extent
order
against
the
company,
i
think
we've
gotten
a
pure
victory
and
a
rather
empty
one.
now,
we
do
think
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
i
was
going
to
come
to
your
--
to
your
claim.
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
complete
my
answer.
we
think
that
the
meaning
of
curtis
is
that
not
only
is
it
entitled
a
picket
but
is
entitled
without
violating
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
and
in
our
brief
we
developed
it,
to
obtain
a
recognition
for
which
it
is
picketing.
but
the
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
correct.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
well,
that
is
what
the
board
is
contending.
and
we
don't
think
that
that
is
correct.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
i
don't
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
don't
think
it
follows
that
because
a
right
to
picket
exist
that
that
necessarily
means
it
has
--
necessarily
means
it
has
the
right
to
get
the
contract,
but
what
i
do
say
is
that
8
(b)
(1)
(a),
as
interpreted
the
--
by
this
court,
does
not
prescribed
either
the
picketing
or
the
obtaining
of
the
agreement,
but
i
come
back
to
the
point
whether
that's
right
or
wrong.
the
heart
of
the
case
does
not
lie
in
my
judgement.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
correct.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
correct.
now,
i
would
like
to
spend
just
a
few
minutes
because
time
is
running
out.
on
the
scope
of
the
board's
order,
in
this
case,
the
--
we
contend
that
the
board
has
gone
much
beyond
what
it
should
in
any
event.
as
the
board's
brief
now
seems
to
say,
the
only
provision
that
is
vulnerable,
if
anything
is
vulnerable,
is
the
exclusive
recognition
clause.
and
the
board,
instead
of
merely,
in
its
order,
vacating
or
ordering
the
vacation
of
the
exclusive
clause
throughout
the
entire
agreement,
now,
the
contract
of
october
the
10th,
if
you
will
look
at
the
record
on
page
111,
contains
a
separability
clause,
a
standard
separability
clause.
even
if
it
didn't,
i
don't
think
the
board
would
have
had
the
right
to
vacate
the
entire
agreement
or
should
have.
the
most
that
should
have
done
was
to
say
that
exclusive
recognition
should
no
longer
be
continued.
it
should
be
withdrawn.
the
board
doesn't,
in
effect,
restore
the
status
quo
which
would
have
been
the
strike.
it
now
holds
that
the
union
cannot
represent
anybody
at
anytime,
not
only
exclusively,
but
anybody
at
any
time
until
and
unless
it
wins
an
election.
now,
it
also
says
that
the
--
the
workers
in
their
brief,
they
said
the
workers
aren't
prejudiced.
the
board
doesn't
order
that
the
workers
conditions
be
withdrawn.
no
it
doesn't
say
that,
but
it
doesn't
require
the
company
to
maintain
the
condition
set
forth
in
the
agreement.
and
in
other
words,
it
is
now
an
optional
aspect
with
the
company
whether
it
will
or
won't
continue
the
gains
and
the
working
conditions
that
were
improved.
the
company,
as
you
will
notice,
is
not
in
this
court
and
has
not
been
below,
and
i
would
not
be
surprised
that
they
would
be
very
happy
to
let
the
board's
order
stand
exactly
as
it
is.
now,
this
court
in
the
rockaway
news
case
and
in
the
consolidated
edison
case,
we
think
has
laid
down
the
correct
rule
that
the
proper
thing
to
do
is
not
to
vacate
the
entire
contract
but
merely
to
eliminate
what
may
be
the
illegal
part
if
anything
is
illegal
in
which
case,
we
would
hear
only
eliminate
the
clause
for
exclusive
recognition
and
leave
it
as
a
“members
only”
agreement.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
yes,
sir.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
yes,
sir.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
i
should
think
that
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
well,
if,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
if
the
union,
the
--
the
contracting
party,
which
made
an
agreement
on
their
behalf,
can
enforce
the
agreement,
if
--
if
it's
out
as
a
bargaining
agent,
i
would
be
very
much
surprised
if
any
third
party
beneficiary
would
be
able
to
enforce
any
rights
under
a
contract
which
has
been
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
well,
i
don't
know
what
the
board
means,
i
don't
see
how
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
if
we
are
--
if
we
have
violated
the
law.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
well,
we
--
we
--
picket
means
otherwise
and
that
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
--
there
is
a
lot
of
laws
saying
that
under
a
collective
agreement,
employees
as
such
don't
have
any
individual
rights.
there
is
a
good
body
of
more
to
that
effect.
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
well,
perhaps
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
well,
i
would
think
that
the
union
would
be
--
mr.
morris
p.
glushien
oh,
maybe
so.
let
me
just
finish
up
--
i
want
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal
ultimately.
may
i
finish
up
by
saying
this.
that
i
think
the
board,
in
its
brief,
has
cited
a
large
group
of
cases
to
say
that
exclusive
recognition
of
a
minority
union
is
improper.
i
think
you
will
find
if
you
look
at
all
of
those
cases.
that
in
every
instance
there
has
been
either
a
union
security
agreement,
which
is
expressly
prohibited
by
the
act
in
the
case
of
a
minority
union,
or
a
rival
union
situation
or
a
dominated
union.
and
that
the
(inaudible)
case
now
before
you
is
the
very
first
instance
in
which
it
is
ultimately
held
that
a
genuine
arm's
length
agreement
such
as
this
was
without
any
features
of
rival
union,
union
security
or
domination
has
been
offset
by
the
board
in
such
a
case.
i'd
like
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
