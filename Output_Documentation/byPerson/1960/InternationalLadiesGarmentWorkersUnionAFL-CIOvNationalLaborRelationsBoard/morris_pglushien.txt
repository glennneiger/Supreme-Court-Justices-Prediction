may

court.
mr.
morris
p.glushien
i
think
to
answer
a
question
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
put
to
mr.
manoli
earlier,
our
brief
does
indicate
the
number
of
organized
employees
out
of
a
total
labor
force
and
the
figure
is
approximately
15
million
out
of
60
million
or
one
out
of
four
and
we
cite
a
--
mr.
morris
p.glushien
industrial
workers,
sir.
it's
one
out
of
four
according
to
the
latest
study
of
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics
which
you
will
find
on
page
35
of
our
brief.
and
also,
in
the
two
years
from
1956
to
1958
which
are
the
latest
available
figures,
the
union
population
declined
by
400,000
members.
mr.
morris
p.glushien
that's
on
page
108.
now,
mr.
manoli,
i
think,
was
sparring
or
answering
questions
in
which
there
is
a
real
dilemma,
apparently,
from
the
board's
point
of
view.
i
think
mr.
manoli
was
indicating
that
if
you
have
a
members
only
contract
with
the
same
terms
applicable
to
everybody,
it
constitute
a
kind
of
exclusive
recognition.
that
would
be
bad
if
the
union
were
a
minority
union
presumably.
but
if
they
were
members
only
contract
with
different
terms,
then
as
the
board
has
held,
it
would
be
discrimination.
so
which
ever
leg
of
the
dilemma
you're
on,
you're
in
difficulty
and
that
is
not
the
only
dilemma
that
the
board's
presentation
presents.
let's
turn
to
the
question
of
good
faith
doubt.
the
board
cases
hold
that
if
an
employer
does
not
have
a
good
faith,
honest
doubt
of
a
union's
majority,
it
is
the
employer
--
but
nevertheless
asks
for
a
definitive
proof
of
majority,
the
employer
is
bargaining
in
bad
faith
if
it
turns
up
that
the
union
did
have
a
majority.
conversely,
however,
if
the
employer
who
has
no
good
faith,
doubt
and
beliefs,
honestly
that
the
union
has
a
majority
doesn't
ask
for
definitive
proof,
then
as
the
board
is
now
urging
to
this
court,
he
acted
as
(inaudible).
and
if
it
turns
out
ultimately
that
the
union
didn't
have
the
majority,
in
that
case,
the
employer
is
been
guilty
of
the
illegal
assistance
and
support
which
is
--
gives
rise
to
that
old
saw,
which
many
of
you,
i'm
sure,
are
familiar
with,
that
a
foresight
were
as
good
as
hindsight,
we'd
be
better
off
by
a
damp
site
but
that
is
not
the
way
law
ought
to
be
made.
now,
i
want
to
add
one
other
thing
that
under
the
board's
order,
and
this
has
not
been
brought
out,
if
an
election
were
conducted
and
lost
by
the
union,
it
couldn't
even
represented
to
all
members
the
way
the
order
is
phrased,
not
even
its
own
members.
mr.
morris
p.glushien
it
has
--
mr.
morris
p.glushien
well,
i
think,
mr.
--
it's
on
--
it
can
--
it
is
on
page
9,
i
believe
or
take
the
page
9,
the
employer
is
debarred
from
recognizing
the
ilg
as
the
representative
any
of
its
employees
or
less
than
two
until
it
demonstrates
its
exclusive
statement
--
exclusive
status
in
a
board
conducted
election.
that's
paragraph
1
(b)
on
page
9.
and
the
remedy
part
by
the
way,
mr.
justice
black,
bears
that
out,
too.
several
times
they've
repeat
that.
so
that
the
union
couldn't
--
there's
a
members
only
representative
unless
he
becomes
the
majority
representative,
and
i
think
that's
an
absurd
order.
now,
mr.
manoli
has
several
times
talked
about
wiping
the
slate
clean
that
has
a
marked
advantage
over
any
other,
these
are
cliches
which
the
board
has
repeated
many
times,
and
i
ought
to
understand
the
kind
of
thinking
that
goes
into
it,
but
i
think
these
cliches
ought
not
to
be
a
substitute
for
facts
that
a
particular
case
ought
to
be
looked
at
in
its
own
context.
and
if
in
a
particular
case,
as
we
think
here,
the
union
did
not
get
any
marked
advantage.
it
settled
the
strike,
it
got
benefits
for
the
workers
and
the
exclusive
recognition
clause,
i
think,
was
just
an
addendum
which,
in
a
practical
effect,
had
no
reality
and
that
the
october
10th
contract,
as
i
said
earlier,
resulted
in
a
fair
uncoerced
--
came
after
a
fair
and
uncoerced
majority
and
that
the
union
should
be
entitled
the
bargaining
rights.
thank
you
very
much.
