mr.
dominick
l.manoli
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
i
think
in
fact,
in
fact,
despite
the
reservation
made
there,
the
employer
could
be
according
to
this
union
exclusive
--
exclusive
representations
status
and
that
that
would
not
have
been
alright
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
--
if
i
understood
the
reservation
correctly.
i
understand
that
on
your
--
on
your
proposal
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
you
would
--
you
would
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
you
would
leave
all
of
that
in
--
except
for
the
qualification
that
the
employer
does
not
know
whether
the
union
is
a
majority
or
not,
that
way
or
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
oh
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
all
of
two.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
on
our
view,
on
our
view
in
view
of
the
fact
that
--
let's
say
that
there's
some
ambiguity.
i
think
your
honor
is
trying
to
suggest
that
you
made
this
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
in
your
proposal,
you'd
made
this
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
that
he
is
recognizing
it
is
the
bargaining
representative,
the
majority
of
the
employees
under
your
proposal.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
well,
let
me
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
let
--
let
me
say
this.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
we've
had,
for
example,
cases
in
which
the
--
the
contract
on
its
face
said
that
it
was
recognizing
the
union
only
for
its
members.
but
the
contract
however
went
on
and
prescribed
terms
for
everybody.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
and
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
and
after
the
contract
has
been
signed,
the
union
has
been
acting
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
for
everybody,
the
fact
that
the
contract
did
not
specifically
say
so.
if,
in
fact,
if,
in
fact,
the
union
by
virtue
of
the
contract
terms
applying
to
everybody
and
by
a
virtue
of
its
post
contract
conduct
is
acting
and
being
recognized
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
no.
now,
i
understand
it
more
clearly,
i
think,
what
your
honor
is
after.
i
think
that
the
employer
in
this
case,
and
this
is
one
the
arguments
made
on
the
other
side,
that
our
position
would
have
barred
this
employer
from
dealing
with
issuing
and
for
the
purpose
of
settling
the
strike.
now,
the
employer
could
talk
to
almost
anybody
about
the
settling
the
strike
but
whether
or
not,
whether
or
not
that
settlement
would
be
binding
upon
the
employees
would
depend
upon
what
the
union
or
whoever
it
was
that
was
entering
into
the
settlement,
to
this
alleged
settlement
with
the
employer,
whether
or
not
that
party
had
the
authority
to
speak,
had
the
authority
to
speak
on
behalf
of
the
employees.
now,
if
in
this
case
here,
the
employer
and
the
union
and
the
employer
saying,
“i
don't
know
if
you
have
a
majority
or
not,
but
let's
talk
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
i
don't
care.
let's
talk
about
the
settlement
of
the
strike.
that
--
that
settlement
would
not
have
been
binding
in
our
--
under
our
view,
would
not
have
been
binding
upon
the
employees,
because
only
a
majority
representative
can
speak
for
all
of
the
employers,
both
the
consenting
as
well
as
the
nonconsenting
--
consenting
majority
as
well
as
the
nonconsenting
minority.
an
employer
could
talk
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
about
settling
a
strike
and
the
employees
might
respect
that
settlement.
but
it
would
not
be
binding
upon
them,
because
the
president
of
the
united
states
would
not
have
authority
to
speak
on
their
behalf
and
bind
them.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
hey
--
the
--
the
employees
would
not
have
to
accept
it,
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
i'm
sorry
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
i
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
he
can
make
an
agreement.
now,
if
that
union
represents
--
does
not
represent
a
majority,
that
agreement
may
be
--
will
be
binding
only
upon
the
membership
of
that
union.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
it
will
not
be
binding
upon
the
nonconsenting
majority.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
that's
right.
now,
when
i
concluded
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
your
honor,
i
should've
also
added
to
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
at
this
whole
problem
of
whether
an
employer
can
recognize
a
minority
union
even
for
its
own
members
is
a
very
difficult
problem.
now,
there
have
been
several
board
cases
in
which
the
board
has
said,
which
the
board
has
said
that
the
employer
may
bargain
with
the
minority
union
for
its
members.
this
is
in
the
absence
of
any
majority
representative
of
course.
may
bargain
for
--
but
then
he
is
under
a
duty
not
to
discriminate
against
the
non-union
people
in
that
--
in
that
unit.
he's
under
a
duty.
now,
it
may
well
be
that
the
employer,
in
order
to
avoid
a
charge
of
discrimination,
will
have
to
extend
the
benefits
which
the
minority
union
has
obtain
for
its
people
to
the
non-members.
but
analytically,
your
honor,
this
does
--
it's
not
the
equivalent
of
saying
that
the
union
has
been
speaking
for
the
--
for
the
non-members.
it's
something
that
may
flow
from
the
fact
that
the
employer
has
made
a
bargain
with
the
minority
union,
that
the
only
way
he
can
save
himself
against
the
charge
of
discrimination
with
respect
to
the
non-members
is
to
give
them
the
same
benefit.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
but
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
yes
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
well,
there
--
practically
there
is
no
difference,
of
course,
that
in
effect,
the
union
has
called
the
two,
has
called
the
two
for
the
--
for
the
non-members,
as
well
as
--
for
its
own
members.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
but,
your
honor,
let's
take
a
case
like
this.
suppose
that
--
suppose
the
general
motors
enters
into
a
some
sort
of
bargaining
contract
with
its
--
with
its
people,
ford
will
probably
have
to
follow
that
the
union
that
general
motors
has
called
the
two
but
is
surely
is
not
bargaining,
that
union
is
not
bargaining
for
the
people
over
--
over
ford
at
the
same
time,
just
the
economic
realities
that
caused
an
employer
to
do
certain
things.
now,
here,
in
the
case
of
a
minority
union
be
in
accordance
to
certain
benefits
for
its
people,
and
as
i
say
this
is
a
wholly
unexplored
issue,
because
while
there
are
these
board
cases
that
say
that
the
minority
union
may
bargain
for
its
people
provided
the
employer
does
not
withhold
the
benefits
from
its
--
from
the
other
--
from
the
non-union
people,
the
board
in
its
latest
decision
on
this
subject
has
said,
“we
are
reserving
judgment
on
that
problem.”
and
i
think
it's
really
never
been
studied,
explored
completely.
but
at
any
rate,
whatever
books
or
whatever
cases
there
are
the
board
on
this
subject,
they
do
say
that
the
employer
may
not,
may
not
withhold
the
benefits
from
the
non-union
employees
if
the
only
reason
is
for
withholding
the
benefits
are
that
they
are
non-union.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
that
--
there
is
that
difference,
your
honor,
but
again,
i
say
that
it's
not
analytically,
analytically
--
and
i
think
you
do
have
to
pay
attention
to
the
analysis
of
the
--
what
it
--
what
the
situation
is
analytically.
it's
not
because
the
minority
union
has
been
bargaining,
it
has
been
bargaining
for
it's
--
for
the
non-members
that
the
non-members
obtained
the
benefits
which
have
been
given
to
the
members.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
that's
what
the
board
has
said,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
yes.
the
only
other
word
that
i
know
that
deals
with
the
subject
is
this
court's
decision
to
consolidated
edison
and
it's
largely
dictum,
i
think.
but
the
court
there
apparently
seem
to
give
approval
to
members
only
contract
but
it
didn't
go
on
to
say
what
the
employer
would
have
to
do
with
respect
to
the
non-members.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
i
will
accept
that
note.[laughs]
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
that's
right.
that's
right,
it's
not
a
bar.
it's
not
a
bar
and
incidentally
i'm
--
as
long
as
we're
talking
about
contract
bar,
under
the
board's
rules,
under
the
board's
so-called
contract
bar
rules,
this
contract
here,
which
on
it's
face,
looks
--
looks
alright
gives
it
--
presumably,
is
giving
exclusive
recognition
to
a
majority
union
that
this
contract
here
would
bar
an
election
for
the
duration
of
the
contract,
the
duration
of
the
contract.
now,
judge
fahy
in
the
court
below,
whose
opinion
i
respect
the
great
deal,
he
dissented.
judge
fahy
here
said,
“well,
those
--
that's
merely
the
board's
rules
that
the
contract
--
the
contract
has
barred
in
election.”
but
i
think
we
have
an
additional
answer
even
if,
even
if
this
contract
would
not
a
bar
to
an
election,
never
the
--
and
we
did
go
to
an
election
upon
the
--
some
petition
to
determine
who
the
representatives
are.
this
union
by
virtue
of
the
recognition
which
--
to
which
is
not
been
entitled
to
has
obtained
a
certain
amount
of
--
of
support.
it
enters
a
list
with
a
--
with
a
marked
advantage
by
having
--
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
has
this
exclusive
recognition.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
no,
your
honor,
the
considerations
are
these.
that
the
union
has
acquired,
has
acquired
this
contract.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
i'm
talking
to
the
contract
as
a
whole.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
i'm
talking
of
the
contract
as
a
whole.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
this
union
obtained
this
contract
only
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
claim
to
be
exclusive
--
exclusive
bargaining
representative
and
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
employer
accorded
that
that
kind
of
exclusive
recognition.
and
we
say,
your
honor,
we
say,
your
honor,
that
those
two
elements,
the
illegal
--
the
illegal
recognition
is
inseparable
from
the
union's
having
obtained
this
contract.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
it
could
--
it
could've
done
that,
but
that
isn't
what
happened.
and
i
think
that
the
board
is
entitled
to
say,
to
--
to
wipe
the
slate
clean,
to
wipe
the
slate
clean.
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
black's
question,
now,
conceivably
the
board
could've
said
that
this
contract
is
alright,
is
alright
with
respect
to
those
members
of
the
union
who's
membership
antedated,
was
membership
antedated
the
support,
the
--
the
illegal
recognition
of
the
union.
and
then
the
board
might
have
said,
you
might
have
gone
a
distinction
between
those
people
on
those
who
joined
after.
those
who
joined
after
and
the
board
might
have
said,
“well,
with
respect
to
those
who
joined
after,
their
membership
is
tainted.
well,
at
least
we
cannot
determine
whether
it
was
uninfluenced
by
the
fact
that
the
union
had
obtained
exclusive
recognition.”
the
board
could
have
done
that
but
i
suggest,
your
honor,
i
suggest,
your
honor,
that
this
is
not
a
very
clean
cut
satisfactory
solution
that
what
it
seems
to
be
good,
solid,
practical
solution
to
this
problem
is
to
restore
these
employees
the
freedom
to
choose.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
just
members
only
contract.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
members
only
contract.
well,
your
honor,
i've
already
indicated
that
there
are
three
board
decisions
that
i
am
aware
of
in
which
have
the
board
has
said
that
a
members
only
contract
is
alright
provided
the
employer
does
not
withhold
the
benefits
from
the
non-members
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
--
by
virtue
of
they
are
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
--
merely
by
virtue
if
they
are
non-union.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
well,
your
honor,
that
was
not
the
situation
in
this
case.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
but
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
it's
a
--
this
union
had
made
a
union
members
contract.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
yes,
they
did.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
they
didn't
go
back
to
work.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
i
assume
they
have.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
it
doesn't
show
in
the
contrary,
no.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
yes.
we
--
we
say
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
this
contract,
as
a
whole,
your
honor,
it's
our
position
that
this
contract,
as
a
whole,
represents
the
fruits
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
by
illegal
conduct,
namely,
the
obtaining
by
the
issuing
of
a
type
of
recognition
to
which
it
was
not
entitled
in
the
first
place.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
now,
what
the
situation
would
have
been,
what
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
because
it
makes,
as
i
say,
you
cannot
disentangle,
you
cannot
disentangle
the
fact
that
this
contract
was
obtained
by
a
union
on
the
basis
that
it
was
the
exclusive
representative
of
these
employees.
and
because
you
cannot
disentangle
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
i
don't
think
--
your
--
your
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
they're
not
--
they
will
not
be
legally
entitled
to
these
benefits.
that's
true.
they
will
not
be
legally
entitled
although
the
employers
are
not
required
to
change
him.
but
under
the
board's
order,
however,
he
is
not
required
to
maintain
this
and
they
would
have
no
contractual
rights
to
those
--
to
those
benefits.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
no,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
under
the
board
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
under
the
board's
order.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
under
the
board's
order
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
let
me
finish.
yes.
i
haven't
finished,
your
honor.
under
the
board's
order,
they
cannot
enter
in
that
contact
until
after
there's
been
an
election.
now,
if
there
is
an
election
held,
if
there's
an
election
held
and
this
union
wins
the
majority
of
the
employers
and
of
course,
it's
free
to
enter
the
contract
bargaining
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
that's
right.
this
union
cannot
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
--
under
--
under
the
board's
order.
under
the
board's
order,
this
union
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
they
can
--
the
--
the
employer
can
deal
--
can
deal
with
the
--
with
these
employees.
they
can
deal
with
some
other
union
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
--
with
some
other
union
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
if
this
contract
had
been
entered
into
a
non-members
only
basis
but
it
wasn't.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
does
the
order
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
it
could
that.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
he
could
do
that,
but
it's
not
this
union
that
can
deal
with
this
employer.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
is
this
number
two
or
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
that
would
present
a
wholly
different
problem.
let
me
put
it
that
way.
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
that's
--
mr.
dominick
l.manoli
well,
your
honor,
the
employees
could
file
a
petition,
and
i
think
that
our
average
time
these
days
on
processing
a
petition
of
that
kind,
provided
there
are
no
complications,
no
extended
hearings,
with
respect
to
units,
other
