mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
under
the
pennsylvania
deficiency
judgment
act,
if
a
mortgagee
forecloses
on
property
and
purchased
the
property
himself
at
the
foreclosure
sale,
then
the
debtor
and
his
guarantors
are
released
from
any
further
liability
to
the
mortgagee.
unless
within
six
months,
he
petitions
to
the
court
to
have
the
fair
market
value
of
the
property
he
determined
and
credits
that
against
the
indictment.
in
effect,
a
purchasing
mortgagee
is
required
to
give
credit
against
the
indebtedness
for
the
fair
market
value
of
the
property
he
acquires
which
is
deemed
to
be
equal
to
the
full
indebtedness
unless
he
proves
it
to
be
otherwise
within
six
months.
the
basic
question
in
this
case
is
whether
that
statute
relieves
the
united
states
of
its
liability
as
guarantor
on
loans
to
veterans
guaranteed
by
the
veterans'
administration
under
the
servicemen's
readjustment
act
of
1944,
that's
commonly
known
--
known
as
the
gi
bill.
the
--
on
january
--
in
january,
1948,
the
respondent,
a
world
war
ii
veteran
borrowed
$13,000
from
the
pennsylvania
bank
for
the
purchase
of
a
home
in
pennsylvania.
on
his
application,
the
veterans'
administration
guaranteed
$4000
of
that
loan.
because
of
the
guarantee,
he
was
not
required
to
make
a
down
payment
and
the
loan
was
given
for
the
full
purchase
price
of
the
property.
after
the
first
three
monthly
payments,
the
respondent
defaulted
in
his
payments
on
the
loan.
and
a
year
later,
on
may
12,
1949,
the
bank
entered
judgment
in
the
state
court
to
foreclose
the
abandoned
mortgage.
execution
was
had
on
the
judgment
at
a
share
of
sale
on
june
29th,
that's
six
weeks
later,
at
which
the
bank
bought
in
the
property
on
a
bid
of
$250.
that's
the
nominal
amount
covering
cost.
a
few
weeks
later
on
july
8th,
the
bank
submitted
its
claim
for
payment
of
the
guarantee
under
the
servicemen's
readjustment
act.
the
va
in
due
course
paid
the
bank
$4000
on
the
guarantee.
now,
at
no
time
did
the
bank
follow
the
procedure
under
the
pennsylvania
deficiency
judgment
act
to
have
the
fair
market
value
of
the
property
determined.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
we
do
not.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
we
do
not.
this
action
is
an
action
brought
by
the
united
states
against
the
respondent,
the
veteran
to
recover
indemnity
from
him
for
the
$4000
payment
that
we
have
paid
the
bank.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
respondent
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
affirmed.
it
agreed
that
the
respondent
was
liable
to
the
united
states
for
indemnity
for
any
amounts
that
we
were
required
to
pay
the
bank.
but
it
held
that
the
va
was
relieved
of
liability
to
the
bank
by
virtue
of
the
pennsylvania
deficiency
judgment
act.
therefore,
we
should
not
have
paid
the
bank
the
$4000
and
accordingly,
we're
not
entitled
to
recover
it
from
the
veteran.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
oh,
we
--
we
have
--
we
agreed
that
if
we
were
not
liable
to
the
bank,
we
can't
recover
from
the
veteran.
what
it
held
was
we
weren't
liable
to
the
bank
and
our
position
is
that
we
were
liable
to
the
bank.
we
are
here
then
in
the
position
of
asserting
our
own
liability.
our
position
is
that
united
states
does
not
relieve
of
liability
on
the
gi
loan
guarantee
by
the
pennsylvania
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
no,
(voice
overlap)
but
they
contest
that.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
they
contest
that.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
that's
right.
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
was
based
solely
on
the
lack
of
our
liability
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
to
the
bank.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
the
veteran
would
be
liable
to
us
if
we
were
liable
to
the
bank.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
now,
the
respondent
--
respondent
does
not
agree
with
that.
yes,
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
right.
the
reason
we
do
that,
although
it
involves
a
very
large
liability
on
the
government,
the
reason
we
--
we
assert
that,
is
that
in
our
view,
it's
essential
to
the
contingent
--
continued
functioning
of
the
gi
loan
program
that
the
liability
under
the
guarantee
not
be
impaired.
we
think
it's
--
without
our
liability
in
these
circumstances,
the
guarantee
as
i
hope
to
show
would
not
be
worth
anything
and
wouldn't
do
the
veterans
any
good.
the
veterans
couldn't
get
loans
under
the
gi
loan
program.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
we
were
--
i'm
not
sure
that
whole
figures
involved.
the
total
loans,
i
think
that
have
added
up
to
about
$30
billion
and
--
and
we
would
not
assert
a
--
the
result
and
guaranteed
liability
on
that
amount
unless
we
were
satisfied
at
least
that
that
that
was
required
by
--
by
the
statute.
now,
i
think
the
question
in
the
case
turns
entirely
upon
a
construction
of
the
--
the
question
of
our
liability
--
our
liability
to
the
bank,
i
will
deal
with
first,
turns
entirely
upon
the
construction
of
the
federal
act
and
the
va
regulations
issued
under
it.
the
court
of
appeals
turn
to
state
law,
as
we
understand
its
opinion,
not
because
it
thought
state
law
was
controlling
of
its
own
force,
but
only
because
it
thought
that
the
federal
regulations
did
not
provide
for
the
matter
and
were
intended
to
leave
its
state
law.
so
the
question
really
is
only
what
the
federal
regulations
do
provide.
and
what
i
hope
to
do
primarily
is
simply
to
show
how
the
federal
act
and
the
regulations
fit
together
in
how
the
guarantee
does
operate.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
there
is
such
a
claim
on
the
indemnity
regulation,
his
liability
over
to
us
which
is
the
second
question.
on
the
first
question,
our
liability
to
think
--
i
would
like
to
state
what
the
respondent's
argument
is
but
i
don't
think
i
can
do
a
justice.
we
are
--
we
really
are
speaking
in
an
entirely
different
terms
and
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
really
what
he
is
arguing
about
our
liability
to
the
bank.
so
i
prefer
just
to
state
or
might
argue
what
the
regulations
provide.
as
they
say
--
said,
the
va
originally
guarantee
at
the
respondent's
request,
$4000
of
the
$13,000
loan.
now,
in
fact,
the
--
the
guarantee
does
not
remain
at
a
fixed
amount
during
the
life
of
the
loan.
section
500
(b)
of
the
act
which
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
pages
--
at
page
62,
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
provides
that
the
--
that
the
guarantee
show
a
decrease
or
increase
pro
rata
with
any
decrease
or
increase
in
the
amount
of
the
outstanding
indebtedness.
now,
the
effect
of
that
is
to
convert
the
guarantee
from
a
guarantee
of
a
fixed
amount
to
a
guarantee
of
a
percentage
of
the
indebtedness
that's
outstanding.
now,
in
this
case,
the
--
the
percentage
works
out
to
be
30.76%.
so
what
the
guarantee
really
was,
was
a
guarantee
of
30.76%
of
the
indebtedness
outstanding
from
time
to
time
not
to
exceed
the
original
amount
of
$4000.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
it's
30.76%.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right.
now,
the
--
that
variable
nature
of
the
amount
of
the
guarantee,
the
fact
that
it's
a
percentage
introduces
one
complication,
because
you
have
to
then
provide
at
what
time
the
amount
becomes
fixed
when
you
--
it
is
liquidated
to
a
fixed
amount
of
guarantee.
that
is
performed
by
section
506
of
the
act
and
the
regulations
under
that
section.
section
506
is
at
page
64
of
our
brief.
well,
that
--
that
provides
that
in
the
event
of
default,
the
holder
shall
notify
the
administrator
who
shall
thereupon
pay
to
such
holder
the
guarantee.
now,
without
more
--
let's
take
that
that
part
of
--
of
506.
that
would
mean
that
the
guarantee
becomes
fixed
at
the
date
of
default
as
the
specified
percentage
of
the
indebtedness
outstanding
on
that
date
and
is
then
absolutely
payable.
however,
the
second
proviso
of
the
506
goes
on
to
say
that
the
administrator
may
permit
forbearance
on
the
part
of
the
lender
and
for
that
purpose,
may
authorize
interest
in
other
charges
to
continue
to
accrue
on
the
indebtedness
for
purposes
of
computing
the
guarantee
beyond
the
date
of
default.
though,
he
cannot
--
he
--
he
has
to
provide
a
cut-off
date
for
that
percentage
computation
no
later
than
the
date
of
judgment
and
decree
of
foreclosure.
the
regulations
under
that
--
now,
i'm
just
taking
about
the
time
at
which
one
computes
the
amount
of
the
guarantee,
the
percentage
computation.
the
regulations
under
that
authority
are
at
page
73
of
our
brief,
section
4321
(a),
subsection
(a)
of
that
section.
now,
those
provide
that
the
guarantee
shall
be
computed
as
the
specified
percentage
applied
to
the
indebtedness
computed
as
of
the
date
of
claim
but
not
later
than
the
date
of
judgment
or
of
decree
of
foreclosure.
now
then,
if
the
claim
is
filed
as
it
maybe
any
time
after
default
and
if
it's
in
fact
filed
before
foreclosure
then
the
date
on
which
the
claim
is
filed
controls
the
computation
for
this
indebtedness
outstanding
on
that
date.
however,
if
the
claim
is
not
field
until
after
foreclosure,
then
the
guarantee
is
computed
not
when
the
claim
is
filed
but
rather
back
at
the
date
of
judgment
of
foreclosure.
so,
the
--
the
guarantee
originally
variable
becomes
fixed
on
the
date
of
judgment
of
foreclosure.
in
this
case,
that
date
was
may
12,
1948
when
the
judgment
was
entered.
on
that
date,
there
were
no
proceeds
of
foreclosure
because
the
corp
--
the
sale,
the
execution,
--
the
sheriff's
sale
didn't
take
place
until
six
weeks
later.
so
the
proceeds
of
foreclosure
do
not
affect
the
computation
of
the
principal
or
face
amount
of
the
guarantee.
as
of
may
13th
--
may
12,
1948,
the
indebtedness
outstanding
in
fact
with
all
the
accrued
interest
in
other
charges
exceeded
$13,000.
the
30
--
30.76%
of
that
which
was
the
guarantee,
exceeded
$4000.
so
the
guarantee
became
fixed
at
$4000
and
it
--
it
is
now
a
liquidated
amount
of
$4000
as
the
face
amount
of
the
guarantee.
now,
all
of
that
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
the
answer
--
first
of
all,
i
haven't
gotten
to
the
point
at
which
the
proceeds
of
foreclosure
are
taken
into
account.
the
proceeds
for
foreclosure
do
have
to
be
taken
into
account.
they
--
they
do
--
don't
affect
the
--
the
face
amount
of
the
guarantee,
i.e.
the
$4000
penalty
amount
--
that
that's
our
maximum
liability
is
$4000.
the
--
the
foreclosure
proceeds
don't
affect
that
and
the
reason
they
don't
is
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
--
they
copied
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
they
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
that
does.
that
does.
that
is
the
final
accounting.
now,
is
it
--
even
if
we
started
out
with
a
guarantee
liability
fixed
at
$4000,
we
guarantee
$4000
of
the
debt.
that's
the
usual
--
that's
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
up
to,
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
you
would
normally
state
the
guarantee
is
$4000.
what
you
would
have
to
pay
--
what
would
you
have
to
pay
would
be
limited
to
the
loss.
i
--
i
think
if
i
go
ahead
and
show
where
you
do
take
into
account
the
foreclosure
proceeds,
it
will
clear
--
it
will
clear
this
up.
the
reason
you
don't
take
the
foreclosure
proceeds
into
account
in
this
first
percentage
computation
is
that
the
result
would
be
to
make
this
not
a
guarantee
but
a
share
--
share
--
sharing
of
the
loss
agreement,
because
if
you
take
the
foreclosure
proceeds
into
account
first
and
then
take
a
percentage,
really
owe
into
paying
is
a
percentage
of
the
ultimate
loss.
and
what
the
guarantee
is
designed
to
do
is
for
us
to
bear
with
the
entire
loss
up
to
amount
of
guarantee.
and
that's
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
that's
why
it's
important
to
compute
the
--
the
amount
of
the
guarantee
before
you
take
into
account
the
foreclosure
proceeds.
now,
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
--
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
let
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
alright.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
--
as
i
say
that
the
--
the
fact
that
we
haven't
considered
the
proceeds
of
foreclosure
in
determining
the
principal
amount
of
the
guarantee
does
not
mean
that
we
don't
take
them
into
account.
we
do
take
them
in
--
into
account.
the
section
506
provides
that
if
he
does
demand,
aim
into
the
guarantee
immediately
upon
the
default
and
we
pay
it.
we
are
then
subrogated
to
his
rights,
to
the
lender's
rights.
that
means
that
if
the
lender
then
forecloses
and
then
sells
the
property
that
he
has
to
repay
to
us
any
proceeds
that
he
realizes
an
excess
of
the
unguaranteed
part
of
the
debt.
so,
he
doesn't
get
a
windfall
on
the
judicial
sale
of
the
property.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
i
would
not,
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
as
i
understand
it,
we
don't
question
the
interpretation
of
the
pennsylvania
law
as
relieving
a
private
guarantor.
now,
the
--
going
back
to
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
bank
cannot
get
a
windfall
depending
upon
how
one
makes
evaluation
of
what
the
bank
gets.
the
--
the
--
mr.
justice
stewart
spoke
of
the
proceeds
on
the
bank's
ultimate
resale.
i
think
everyone
would
agree
and
i
think
anyone
makes
an
argument
to
the
contrary
that
the
profit
or
loss
on
the
resale
isn't
--
is
never
relevant.
we
never
take
into
account
what
happens
in
subsequent
sale.
the
problem
is
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
--
that
is
right.
that
is
basically
right.
if
a
third
party
buys
the
property
at
the
sheriff's
sale,
we
can't
go
after
him
for
the
profit
loss
when
he
resells
it
a
year
later.
the
problem
is
how
you
account
for
it
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
at
the
date
of
the
sheriff's
sale?
that's
the
time
of
which
we
have
to
make
our
final
accounting.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
let
me
say,
the
way
this
is
done
--
section
--
turning
to
--
back
to
the
regulations,
i
think
if
i
follow
up
through
the
regulations,
i
--
i
will
show
you
exactly
where
our
procedure
differs
from
the
state
procedure.
section
4321,
subsection
(b)
is
the
section
which
directly
governs
this
case.
this
applies
to
the
situation
where
the
--
the
guarantee
is
not
claimed
until
after
the
foreclosure
sale,
after
the
--
the
realization
on
the
proceeds
of
the
security.
it
provides
that
credits
accruing
from
the
proceeds
of
a
sale
or
other
disposition
of
the
security
subsequent
to
the
date
of
computation,
that's
this
case,
we've
already
fixed
the
principal
amount
of
$4000.
and
prior
to
the
submission
of
the
claim,
here
the
claim
wasn't
submitted
until
after
the
sheriff's
sale,
shall
be
reported
to
the
administrator
and
the
amount
payable
on
the
claim
--
on
the
claim
shall
at
no
event
exceed
the
remaining
balance
of
the
indebtedness.
that
is,
we
agreed,
we
were
liable
to
pay
the
bank
only
an
amount
equal
to
the
indebtedness
less
the
credits
for
the
proceeds
of
foreclosure
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
i.e.
the
loss
--
the
loss.
now,
well
i
can't
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
$13,000
it
was
over
that
actually
at
this
time.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
that's
the
question.
the
question
is
what
are
the
credits
we
have
to
give
for
the
--
for
the
sale?
that's
where
--
we
agreed
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
you
have
to
first
allow
a
credit
for
the
sale
of
the
security.
the
point
at
which
we
depart
from
the
court
of
appeals
is,
"how
do
you
determine
what
that
credit
shall
be?"
the
court
of
appeals
said
that,
"the
regulations
don't
provide
for
it,
we
have
to
turn
to
state
law."
under
the
pennsylvania
deficiency
judgment
act,
the
dollars
bid
at
the
sale
if
the
mortgagee
buys,
are
--
are
irrelevant.
the
mortgagee,
the
purchasing
mortgagee,
has
to
give
credit
for
the
full
balance
of
the
indebtedness
unless
he
filed
the
petition
in
the
state
court
to
--
to
appraise
the
property,
then
he
has
to
give
a
credit
for
the
fair
market
value
of
the
property.
since
the
bank
didn't
file
a
petition,
under
the
pennsylvania
law,
he
would
have
to
give
credit
for
the
full
indebtedness.
there'll
be
nothing
remaining
due
and
we
would
have
to
pay
nothing
under
the
guarantee.
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
held.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
don't
really
know
of
how
likely
in
practice
that
is
to
be
contested.
if
it's
contested,
you
have
a
full
hearing
with
expert
witnesses
on
value.
now,
whether
in
practice,
these
things
can
be
put
through
without
a
great
contest,
i
--
i
am
really
not
informed.
now,
the
point
which
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
went
wrong
was
in
thinking
that
the
--
the
federal
regulations
do
not
themselves
provide
for
the
credits.
it
is
our
position
that
the
regulations
do
specifically
provide
what
credit
shall
be
made
upon
the
disposition
of
the
security.
that
regulation
is
section
4320
which
appears
at
page
68
through
72
of
our
brief.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
think
--
i
think
mr.
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
if
i
may
--
if
i
may
--
if
i
can
tell
you
first
what
they
do
then
i
--
i
can
--
i
can
tell
you
how
i
justify
it
in
terms
of
the
statute.
well,
i
think
it
will
help
--
i
--
if
i
first
state
what
they
do.
this
provision,
70
--
4320
and
in
fact
provides
that
upon
the
administrators
receiving
notice
of
a
proposed
sale
of
the
security,
the
administrator
may
specify
an
upset
price.
if
he
specifies
an
upset
price,
the
mortgagee,
the
bank,
the
lender,
must
give
credit
for
that
upset
price
unless
in
fact
it's
sold
for
more
in
which
case
he
has
to
credit
the
actual
proceeds
but
he
must
give
credit
for
the
upset
price.
in
return
for
that,
he
has
an
option
to
resell
the
property
to
the
va
at
that
price.
and
if
we
do
not
set
an
upset
price,
the
regulation
specifically
provide
that
he
need
credit
against
the
indebtedness
for
purposes
of
the
guarantee
only
the
actual
proceeds.
now,
i
--
i
--
i'd
like
to
explain
what
the
function
is
of
the
upset
price
and
how
it
works.
the
reason
we
have
that
authority
is
to
minimize
our
liability
on
the
guarantee.
well,
the
only
thing
that
will
reduce
our
liability
on
the
guarantee
is
a
credit
that
exceeds
the
unguaranteed
balance
of
indebtedness,
in
this
case,
$9000.
the
indebtedness
was
$13,000,
guarantee
of
$4000.
we
still
have
to
pay
$4000
unless
the
credit
on
the
sale
of
the
security
is
more
than
$9000.
therefore,
we
have
no
interest
in
establishing
an
upset
price
unless
we're
willing
to
establish
one
higher
than
$9000.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
us
how
much
less
than
that
is
realized
so
long
as
it's
less
than
that.
so,
we
establish
an
upset
price
only
when
it's
on
our
appraisal
--
we
--
we
make
a
--
have
appraisal
reports
made
of
the
property
and
determined
in
our
view
what
the
realizable
value
of
the
property
is.
if
the
realizable
value
exceeds
the
unguaranteed
part
of
the
debt,
so
we'll
reduced
our
liability
in
the
guarantee,
we
establish
an
upset
price.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
this
--
since
we
were
unwilling
to,
we
could
have.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
--
that
is
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh
no,
think
--
we
get
the
benefit
of
the
actual
proceeds.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
i'm
sorry.
the
--
this
all
goes
to
the
sheriff's
sale
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
the
sheriff's
sale.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
and
--
and
an
unknown
theory
couldn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
everyone
agrees
that
it
is
solely
the
sheriff's
sale
that
we're
concerned
with.
now,
the
upset
price
provisions
of
the
regulations
are
we
think
the
--
the
heart
of
the
protection
provided
by
the
guarantee.
they
are
essential
to
the
perform
--
to
the
function
of
the
guarantee
and
encouraging
lenders
to
make
loans
to
veterans.
the
purpose
of
the
gi
loan
programs
is
to
--
is
to
provide
a
substitute
to
the
down
payment
for
veterans
who
can't
afford
a
down
payment.
the
guarantee,
under
the
regulations
with
the
upset
price
provisions,
do
just
that.
the
worst
that
can
happen
to
a
lender
under
the
guarantee
as
we
construe
the
regulations
is
that
you'll
be
paid
the
guarantee
in
full
and
we'll
have
to
accept
the
house
for
the
rest
of
the
indebtedness.
that's
what
happens
to
him
when
he
has
a
down
payment.
if
you
have
a
30%
down
payment,
the
lender
advances
only
70%.
the
house
stands
are
only
70%
and
if
he
buys
it
in
under
the
pennsylvania
law
and
has
to
accept
it
in
full
payment,
it
still
stands
for
only
70%
so
he
has
a
30%
cushion.
our
guarantee
works
exactly
the
same
way.
he
gets
the
guarantee
unless
he's,
otherwise,
made
whole
by
either
the
actual
cash
proceeds
or
the
offer
of
the
va
in
the
form
of
the
upset
price.
he
always
had
--
he
established
an
upset
price,
he
has
the
option
selling
it
to
us
and
can
be
made
whole.
but
unless
he
is
otherwise
made
whole,
we
are
liable
on
the
guarantee
and
it's
that
function
of
the
guarantee
that
makes
it
the
equivalent
of
a
down
payment.
now,
under
the
pennsylvania
law,
under
decisions
below
i
think
that
it
is
demonstrable
that
the
guarantee
is
virtually
no
protection
to
lenders.
now,
we're
not
issuing
protecting
lenders
for
their
own
sake.
we
want
to
protect
the
lenders
in
order
to
get
them
to
lend
money.
and
veterans
--
the
--
the
va
guaranteed
loans
are
not
particularly
attractive
investments
or
generally
a
low
interest
rate.
and
to
induce
100%
financing
to
the
veterans,
we
have
to
provide
security
and
protection
to
lenders.
now,
on
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
we
--
you
--
you
probably
wouldn't
have
both
the
down
payment
and
the
guarantor.
we
might
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
here,
we
have
no
down
payment.
there's
no
down
payment.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
would
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
would
think
that's
fairly
unlikely
in
pennsylvania.
i
think
the
effect
of
this
kind
of
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
effect
of
this
kind
statute
in
cutting
off
the
liability
of
the
guarantor.
this
cuts
off
the
liability
of
the
guarantor.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
i
think
i
was
specific,
yes
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
but
i
don't
think
you'll
find
many
lending
institutions
willing
to
rely,
make
out
100%
loan
and
willing
to
rely
upon
a
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
court's
evaluation
of
the
property
in
payment
of
that
loan.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
they
rely
upon
the
down
payment
cushion.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
it
is
except
that
ours
is
not
cut
off
by
pennsylvania
law.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
they
are
not
giving
the
guarantees?
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
i
doubt
that
they
are.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
but
--
and
on
the
--
the
question
of
--
of
indemnity,
i
--
i
will
rely
on
our
brief's
treatment
of
that.
thank
you.
