justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
they
paid
$250
and
they
brought
it
in.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
therefore,
this
$4000
do
--
do
--
(inaudible)
guarantee.
now,
they
hold
it
and
sell
it
for
$25,000,
in
a
couple
of
years,
it's
not
wasted.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we're
talking
in
figures.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
we
have
figures
here.
we
had
--
wasn't
the
--
the
indebtedness
was
$13,000?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now,
the
proceeds
to
the
sale
were
$250.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
see
if
i
get
this
clearly
mr.
barnett,
having
instead
about
$250.
it's
a
usual
mortgagee
who's
trying
to
bid.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
the
--
that
that
had
not
been
the
proceeds,
but
there
had
in
fact
when
the
sheriff's
sale
in
a
price
of,
say
$11,000
had
been
realized.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
mortgagee
would
have
to
credit
that
$11,000
because
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
indebtedness
of
$13,000.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
the
government's
obligation
would
have
been
reduced
at
two.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
since
in
this
instance,
the
government
couldn't
fix
an
upset,
that
didn't
happen
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
$250.
if
the
government
had
fixed
an
upset
price
of
$11,000,
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it
would've
been
the
same
result.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
since
it
couldn't
fix
one,
an
excess
of
$9000
will
fix
none.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
unwilling
about
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
unwilling
to.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that?
that's
the
obligation
that
became
forth
though.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
independently,
the
fact
that
the
bank
later
in
fact
sold
the
property
for
$10,500.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
didn't
the
bank
actually
sell
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
$10,500
ultimate
sale
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
doesn't
mean
(voice
overlap)
doing
those
guarantees,
i
take
it
out,
the
girard
trust
company?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no,
i
mean
making
arrangements
such
as
uncle
sam
has
made
that
will
enable
people
to
buy
a
property
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
without
paying
anything,
none
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
might
not.
