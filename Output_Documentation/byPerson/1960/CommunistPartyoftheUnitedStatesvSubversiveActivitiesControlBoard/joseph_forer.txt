mr.
joseph
forer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
first
to
take
up
our
point
that
the
act
is
unconstitutional
because
it
deprives
the
petitioners'
members
of
liberty
and
property
without
due
process
of
law.
now,
mr.
abt
pointed
out
once
the
registration
order
becomes
final,
it
outlaws
the
petitioner
as
an
organization.
and
it's
also
clear,
however,
that
the
order
will
have
catastrophic
effects
on
the
members
of
the
petitioner.
first
of
all,
their
names
and
addresses
have
to
be
listed
on
a
public
register
with
the
attorney
general
as
members
of
this
organization
that's
been
condemning
as
a
foreign
control
seditious
conspiracy
and
this
register
is
open
to
public
inspection.
this
is
the
same
as
making
them
wear
an
armband
or
making
them
wear
a
scarlet
letter
insofar
as
subjecting
them
to
social
ostracism,
social
appropriate
and
social
reprisal.
secondly,
the
act
subjects
the
members
by
its
terms
in
special
sanctions
enforceable
by
criminal
penalties.
this
--
this
also
been
listed
by
mr.
abt.
they
include
barring
the
member
from
an
extensive
range
of
private
employment
barring
him
from
any
labor
union
office
or
employment,
barring
him
from
government
--
governmental
employment,
preventing
him
from
receiving
or
applying
for
a
passport,
denaturalizing
him
under
certain
conditions,
reporting
him,
at
least,
an
alien.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
forer
as
soon
as
the
order
becomes
final,
the
sanctions
become
affected
--
mr.
joseph
forer
--
whether
or
not
they
are
registered.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes,
but
actually,
these
member
sanctions
come
into
play
even
before
he
sends
the
notice.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes,
with
one
exception.
mr.
joseph
forer
his
name
--
his
--
the
--
the
listing,
so
far
as
listing
on
the
register,
the
listing
has
included
everybody
with
a
member
for
the
last
12
years
--
mr.
joseph
forer
--
last
12
months,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
joseph
forer
then
he's
eligible.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
he
just
take
an
awful
chance.
no
--
no
reason
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
except
for
the
other
sanctions.
mr.
joseph
forer
he
can
get
rid
of
the
sanctions
by
putting
the
organization.
mr.
joseph
forer
but
--
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
your
question
assumes
some
of
the
things
that
i'm
going
to
come
to
because
that
includes
as
--
mr.
joseph
forer
yes,
well
for
i
get
in
--
just
let
me
answer
your
question.
assuming,
for
example,
a
member
with
full
knowledge
of
the
purposes
of
the
organization,
and
that's
one
of
the
first
things
i'm
going
to
come
to
with
something.
i
think
i
will
answer
your
question
in
the
course
of
my
argument.
but
if
the
member
remains
a
member
and
doesn't
resign,
he
becomes,
for
all
practical
purposes,
a
member
of
a
special
class
of
inferior
people.
he
--
he
becomes
--
the
--
all
the
members
become
what
you
might
call
a
class
of
untouchables.
mr.
joseph
forer
he
can
--
mr.
joseph
forer
--
quit.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
i
--
i'm
coming
to
what
he
has
to
know
in
a
minute,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
joseph
forer
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
if
his
question
is
--
mr.
joseph
forer
--
can
--
or
his
assumption,
yes.
i
intend
to
answer
that.
but
the
point
i
am
making,
and
i
think
this
is
--
distinguishes
the
act
from
what
justice
frankfurter
assumed,
that
under
the
act,
the
member
gets
this
untouchable
status
because
of
one
thing
only
and
that
is
the
bare
fact
that
he
is
a
member
of
an
organization
ordered
the
register.
now,
the
order
against
the
organization,
and
i'll
elaborate
that
in
a
moment,
the
order
against
the
organization
is
based
on
findings
that
the
organization
is
under
soviet
control
that
the
organization
is
advancing
the
objectives
of
the
world
communist
movement
but
nobody
ever
finds
that
the
members
under
foreign
control,
nobody
ever
finds
that
the
member
is
advancing
any
sinister
objectives.
furthermore,
the
sanctions
of
the
act
are
applicable
whether
or
not
the
member
has
any
intent,
they
are
applicable
to
the
member
whether
or
not
he
--
he
has
this
activity
factor
and
they
are
applicable
to
the
member
whether
or
not
he
has
any
knowledge
that
the
--
the
purposes
of
the
organization
are
bad.
they
are
even
applicable
if
he
has
no
knowledge
that
a
registration
order
was
issued
and
detained
point.
mr.
joseph
forer
this
answers
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
your
honor,
the
act
says,
and
i
have
to
go
by
what
the
act
says,
that
these
sanctions
are
enforceable
against
a
member
through
with
knowledge
or
notice
and
section
13
(a)
of
the
act
says
that
a
member
gets
notice
when
the
registration
order
is
published
in
the
federal
register.
now,
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
concede
that
anybody
who
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party
will
undoubtedly
get
notice
and
will
undoubtedly
know
that
this
order
of
the
board
was
affirmed.
so
it
is
true
that
a
member
of
the
communist
party
will
know
what
any
member
of
the
communist
party
in
his
right
mind
must
already
know
and
that
is
that
the
government
condemns
the
communist
party.
but
he
doesn't
have
to
know,
he
doesn't
have
to
know
that
the
communist
party
is
a
bad
organization.
he
doesn't
have
to
know.
he
doesn't
--
that
the
communist
party
is
controlled
by
the
soviet
union.
he
doesn't
have
to
know
that
the
communist
party
has
bad
objectives.
mr.
joseph
forer
he
--
mr.
joseph
forer
--
all
knows
is
that
the
government
says
that.
he
knew
that
already.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
joseph
forer
not
quite.
that
--
that
--
mr.
joseph
forer
--
should
in
a
somewhat
different
part.
what
i
am
saying
is
--
mr.
joseph
forer
well
--
mr.
joseph
forer
i'm
--
well,
you
--
you're
saying
he
shouldn't
be
stock
without
getting
an
opportunity.
mr.
joseph
forer
i'm
saying
that
you're
talking
in
terms
of
what
should
be.
i
prefer
to
talk
in
terms
of
what
the
act
is.
that's
the
only
difference
between
them.
now,
maybe
it's
just
phraseology
but
that
just
happens
in
the
way
i
think.
but
under
the
act,
the
fact
is
that
he
gets
stock
if
he
knows
or
has
notice
and
i
don't
care,
i'm
assuming
--
assume
that
he
knows.
if
he
knows
that
the
subversive
activities
control
board
thinks
that
the
communist
party
is
just
terrible
organization
and
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
apparently
bought
so
too
at
least
to
the
extent
of
affirming
the
order
of
the
board.
mr.
joseph
forer
it
would
have
to
think
that
there
was
a
basis
for
the
board's
order.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
i
--
i
think
that
one
of
the
issues
is
whether
the
--
the
court's
order
is
supported
by
the
evidence.
mr.
joseph
forer
my
argument
is
this.
in
wieman
against
updegraff,
this
court
condemned
the
indiscriminate
classification
of
innocent
with
knowing
activity
and
specifically
held
that
you
can't
bar
an
individual
from
a
privilege,
in
that
case,
government
employment,
because
of
membership
in
a
bad
organization
unless
in
a
minimum,
the
individual
knew
that
the
organization
was
bad.
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
mr.
joseph
forer
your
hypothesis
is
wrong.
he
doesn't
know
that.
all
he
knows
is
that
the
--
is
that
the
--
the
ford
county.
now,
in
wieman
against
updegraff,
he
knew,
mr.
wieman
knew,
i
guess
with
mr.
wieman
not
mr.
updegraff.
mr.
wieman
knew
that
the
organizations
have
been
found
bad
by
a
government
agency
because
these
were
organizations
on
the
attorney
general's
list.
in
adler
against
the
board
of
education,
mr.
adler
knew
that
the
organization
had
been
found
bad.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
that's
--
but
in
adler
against
board
of
education,
that's
exactly
what
they
had.
they
had
an
adversary
--
administrative
adversary
proceeding
with
judicial
review
by
the
court.let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
you
put
the
sanctions
on
the
member
because
he
is
stubborn
enough
to
believe
that
the
subversive
activities
control
board
is
wrong
and
because
he
is
stubborn
enough
to
disagree
within
the
decision
of
this
court,
i
think
you're
violating
due
process
or
the
act
is
violating
due
process
because
you
are
punishing
them
not
for
being
bad
or
for
knowing
anything
bad,
you're
punishing
them
for
being
stubborn.
and
i
think
people
are
entitled
to
be
stubborn
even
to
the
point
when
they
think
that
--
that
decisions
of
this
board
are
wrong.
mr.
joseph
forer
maybe
they'll
agree
with
the
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
joseph
forer
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
i
think
you
did.
i
would
--
and
what
i
was
challenging
was
your
hypothesis.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
do
because
i
think
that
this
act
applies
regardless
of
any
intent
and
regardless
of
any
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
member.
and
i'll
go
further,
mr.
justice
harlan.
if
this
hypothetical
member
should
happen
to
read
this
long
modified
report
of
the
board
and
then
should
happen
to
read
the
last
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think
it
might
well
confirm
it
in
the
belief
that
there
was
no
case
against
the
--
the
petitioner.
and
you
could
disagree
with
this
court
--
with
this
court
affirmatively.
now,
the
first
due
process
restriction
--
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
my
--
mr.
joseph
forer
and
you
shouldn't
make
him
lose
his
job
to
say
and
i
know
better.
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
this
isn't
just
a
social
consequence.
this
is
a
legal
consequence
--
mr.
joseph
forer
alright.
mr.
joseph
forer
--
is
that
the
member
sanctions
are
invalid
not
because
they
apply
whether
or
not
the
member
has
knowledge
that
the
organization
is
of
the
character
that
the
subversive
control
board
says
that
it
is
and
even
though
the
member
disagrees
with
the
court's
estimate
of
its
character.
but
there
is
i
think
another
due
process
restriction
here
other
than
that
of
this
scientor
as
to
the
organization
purposes
and
that
restriction,
i
think
was
spelled
out
not
in
warrington
but
in
adler
against
the
board
of
education.
and
the
principle
there
is
that
a
person
cannot,
because
of
membership
in
a
bad
organization,
be
excluded
from
privileges
open
to
other
people
unless
he
personally
has
an
opportunity
to
establish
that
despite
his
membership,
he
is
a
fit
person
to
enjoy
the
privilege.
in
other
words,
as
i
read
adler,
it
says
that
a
presumption
of
unfitness
to
enjoy
a
privilege
cannot
be
made
conclusive
because
of
organizational
membership,
the
most
it
can
be
is
a
prima
facie
presumption
which
the
member
has
to
--
have
a
chance
to
rebut.
the
act
doesn't
give
a
member
a
chance
to
rebut
at
any
such
presumption.
he
doesn't
get
a
hearing
as
to
his
personal
fitness.
he
doesn't
get
a
chance
to
show
that
even
if
he
is
a
communist,
still
that's
not
a
good
reason
in
his
case,
to
deprive
him
of
his
job
in
general
motors
or
some
other
defense
facility
or
to
deprive
him
of
his
union
office
or
to
bar
him
from
traveling
abroad.
he
gets
no
chance
to
show
that
despite
his
membership
in
the
party,
he
has
no
individual
propensity
of
the
wrong-doing
and
that
he
is
an
innocent
and
trustworthy
and
loyal
person
and
for
those
two
reasons
alone,
i
think
that
the
member
sanctions
are
invalid.
if
he
resigns,
if
he's
willing
to
give
up
his
constitutional
right
to
be
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
then
he
gets
out
these
sanctions.
mr.
joseph
forer
do
you
mean
the
basic
question
of
does
a
person
have
a
constitutional
right
to
be
--
mr.
joseph
forer
i
think
a
person
does
have
a
constitutional
right
to
be
member
of
the
communist
party
and
i
think
that
that
--
that
--
that
was
--was
assumed
by
the
court
in
the
douds
case.
i
want
to
skip
over
now
to
various
other
constitutional
questions
in
order
to
come
to
a
question
of
application
and
construction
of
the
act
and
that
involves
the
meaning
of
the
term,
foreign
control.
now,
under
section
3
(3)
of
the
act,
a
communist-action
organization
is
defined
in
terms
of
two
characteristics,
both
of
which
have
existed.
in
the
first
of
these
characteristics
is
that
the
organization
be
substantially
directed,
dominated
or
controlled
by
the
soviet
union.
in
board's
convenience
it
is
this
component
that
we're
calling
the
foreign
control
component
of
the
definition
of
a
communist-action
organization
and
the
meaning
of
this
foreign
control
component
comes
up
in
at
least
two
ways.
first,
we
say
that
the
board
and
the
court
below,
applied
an
erroneous
concept
to
foreign
control
and
that
on
this
ground
alone,
the
court's
order
and
the
judgment
below
should
be
set
aside.
and
secondly,
we
say
that
under
a
correct
definition
of
the
foreign
control
component,
it
is
clear
that
the
evidence
does
not
establish
the
existence
of
that
component.
now,
the
meaning
that
we
would
give
and
that
we
say
the
foreign
control
component
should
have
requires
a
relationship
in
which
the
soviet
union
has
and
exercised
some
power
to
exact
compliance
with
its
demands
from
a
domestic
organization.
it's
not
satisfied
merely
by
some
voluntary
conformity
by
the
domestic
organization
with
the
soviet
union.
we
say
that
in
a
controlled
relationship
for
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
there
has
to
be
some
course
of
means,
direct
or
indirect,
whereby
the
superior,
in
this
case,
the
soviet
union,
can
compel
compliance
with
its
requirements
or
impose
sanctions
for
noncompliance
and
if
there
is
no
means
of
coercion,
there
cannot
be
any
control.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes,
but
legal
control
involves
some
kind
of
coercive
mechanism,
but
if
--
if
there
is
no
means
by
which
one
or
the
--
the
soviet
union
has
any
power
to
discipline
or
coerce
the
organization
and
a
domestic
organization
nevertheless,
imitates
or
follows
or
adheres
to
soviet
views
or
policies,
that
adherence
is
a
product
of
voluntary
conformity.
it's
not
a
product
of
control
and
this
gets
us
back
very
much
to
the
initial
question
that
justice
black
has.
because
if
all
this
--
if
all
of
that
the
foreign
control
of
this
statute
requires,
is
not
that
the
foreign
government
have
any
power
to
give
any
behest
to
the
organization
as
justice
black
says,
but
merely
that
the
domestic
organization
agrees
and
acquiesces
in
the
views
of
the
foreign
power
or
even
on
its
own,
goes
out
and
promotes
those
views,
so
that
it
is
not
anything
like
a
genuine
agent,
then
obviously
a
--
any
constitutional
source
drawn
from
power
to
control
foreign
relations
doesn't
exist,
it
seems
to
me.
now,
this
meaning
of
control
that
i
am
suggesting
as
some
coercive
mechanism
--
mr.
joseph
forer
it
follows
i
think
from
the
dictionary
definition.
it
follows
from
the
case
definitions
in
other
fields
of
law.
it's
the
only
meaning
which
corresponds
to
the
description
in
section
2
of
the
act
of
the
relationship
between
the
soviet
union
and
communist-action
organizations
in
various
countries
and
it
is
the
only
meaning
which
prevents
the
foreign
control
component
from
being
a
redundant
here
of
the
section
3
(3)
definition,
because
if
all
that
the
foreign
control
component
means
or
--
is
a
voluntary
following
of
soviet
objective,
then
it
is
absolutely
nothing
to
the
second
component
of
a
communist-action
organization
in
section
3
(3),
which
is
that
the
organization
advanced
soviet
objective.
and
finally,
if
the
foreign
control
component
is
satisfied
by
nothing
more
than
the
organization's
voluntary
conformity
and
it
conforms
to
the
soviet
ideas
because
it
agrees
with
them,
then
it
seems
me,
it
magnifies
the
constitutional
objections
to
the
act.
now,
the
government
seems
to
say
that
the
definition
i
have
suggested
can't
be
correct
because
there
can't
be
a
relationship
whereby
a
foreign
group
can
coerce
a
domestic
organization,
but
obviously
this
isn't
so
and
domestic
groups
can
be
and
are
controlled
by
foreigners
or
by
foreign
sources
in
a
lot
ways.
and
for
example,
financial
subsidization
can
be
a
lever
of
control
because
the
giver
can
withhold
or
threaten
to
withhold
funds
or
subsidies
by
noncompliance
with
attrition
or
you
can
have
control
through
property
ownership,
through
financial
indebtedness
or
in
the
case
of
a
corporation,
through
stock
ownership.
you
can
have
levers
of
control
through
a
power
to
punish
essential
supplies
because
under
the
organization's
charter,
the
power
to
name
some
officers
or
directors
is
reserved
to
--
to
the
controller
or
through
an
interlocking
directorate
and
so
on.
now,
i
am
perfectly
sure
for
example
that
standard
oil
of
new
jersey
has
and
utilizes
levers
of
control
over
various
foreign
enterprises
even
though
it
doesn't
actually
own
them.
now,
if
we're
right
as
to
the
meaning
of
control,
then
it
is
clear
that
the
board
and
the
court
below
applied
a
wrong
construction
of
the
statute
and
this
misconstruction
is
in
fact,
expressly
stated
in
the
court's
second
opinion.
but
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
no
evidence
and
there
is
no
final
by
either
of
the
court
or
the
board
that
the
soviet
union
or
any
soviet
organization
has
or
utilizes
any
leavers
whereby
it
may
or
does
exercise
any
coercive
authority
over
the
petition.
and
with
regard
to
the
subject
of
finances
and
i've
mentioned
finances
as
a
potential
lever,
the
board
itself
expressly
found
and
i
quote
and
this
is
the
court's
finding,
"the
record
contains
no
evidence
of
substantial
financial
aid
subsequent
to
1940
and
none
after
1944."
now,
in
its
second
opinion,
the
court
below
appreciating
and
acknowledging
the
actions
of
evidence
of
any
coercive
means,
held
that
the
foreign
control
component
does
not
require
any
coercive
power
and
expressly
said
that
the
foreign
control
component
is
satisfied
if
an
organization
voluntarily
follows
soviet
direction.
now,
for
reasons
i
have
already
covered,
this
is
just
wrong.
but
even
if
this
test
is
adopted,
if
it's
enough
to
have
a
voluntary
following
a
soviet
direction,
it
still
was
not
applied
by
the
court
and
it
still
was
not
met
by
the
evidence
because
if
the
test
is
a
voluntary
compliance
with
soviet
directions,
then
the
record
has
to
show
that
the
petitioner
receives
soviet
directions
with
which
it
then
comply
even
voluntarily.
but
the
fact
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
and
there
is
no
finding
by
either
the
board
or
the
court
below
that
at
any
time
since
at
least
1940,
10
years
before
enactment
of
the
act,
1940
the
date
when
petitioner
disaffiliated
from
the
communist
international,
there
is
no
evidence,
there
is
no
finding
that
since
1940,
petitioner
received
any
soviet
directive
or
anything
that
could
be
construed
to
be
a
soviet
directive
for
him
to
follow
voluntarily
or
involuntarily
and
the
government's
brief
itself,
acknowledge
it
and
this
is
in
its
footnote
on
page
235,
footnote
84.
petitioner,
that's
us,
correctly
states,
that
the
board
made
no
findings
that
petitioner
has
continued
to
receive
directives
from
the
soviet
union
after
his
disaffiliation
from
the
communist
international
and
that
this
disaffiliation
as
i've
said
was
in
1940.
now,
we
now
agree
at
pages
99
to
100,
we
list
all
the
contacts
after
1940
between
petitioner
and
the
soviet
union
or
soviet
citizens
which
are
mentioned
in
the
board's
modified
report,
every
single
one.
mr.
joseph
forer
pages
99
and
100
of
our
brief
and
there
are
just
five
of
them
and
this
is
what
they
are.
first,
that
in
1945,
elizabeth
gurley
flynn,
one
of
petitioners'
leaders
and
officers,
while
on
a
visit
to
france,
ran
into
some
russian
women
and
she
chatted
with
them
about
child
care,
postwar
reconstruction
and
the
rights
of
women.
second,
in
1949,
the
petitioner
sends
stalin
a
telegram,
congratulating
him
on
his
70th
birthday
and
saying
that
he
was
a
great
man
and
that
the
communist
party
of
the
soviet
union
had
--
had
--
and
--
and
that
the
soviet
union
had
great
achievements.
that
was
his
70th
birthday
telegram.
third,
in
december
1950,
the
communist
party,
the
soviet
union
sent
a
telegram
of
greetings
to
petitioners'
national
convention
in
which
they
set
up
among
other
things
that
petitioner
was
a
--
was
really
standing
up
pretty
good
under
all
the
unjust
attacks
from
the
government.
fourth,
if
petitioners'
publications
sometimes
reprint
articles
and
soviet
publication
and
its
members
sometimes
read
a
newspaper
put
up
by
the
--
now,
debunked
european
communist
information
bureau
and
five,
the
daily
worker
had
a
correspondent
in
moscow.
now
these
are
all
the
contacts,
if
they've
been
be
called
contacts,
since
1940,
beginning
10
years
before
the
--
the
enactment
of
the
act.
they
show
no
soviet
directions
to
the
petitioner.
they
show
no
soviet
assistance
to
the
petitioner.
they
show
no
dealings
between
the
petitioner
and
the
soviet
union
other
than
two
congratulatory
telegrams,
one,
in
one
direction
and
one,
in
the
other.
they
show
no
supervision
by
the
soviet
union.
they
show
no
reporting
by
petitioners
to
the
soviet
union.
they
just
have
no
relevance
to
show
foreign
control
any
more
than
if
the
government
introduced
evidence
as
i
suppose
they
might
have
been
able
to
do
that
american
communist
wants
to
see
a
performance
to
this
(inaudible)
ballot.
so
it's
abundantly
clear
that
neither
the
board
nor
the
court
below
applied
a
meaningful
definition
of
foreign
control
and
furthermore
that
even
under
the
loose
definition
of
the
court
below
of
a
voluntary
following
of
directions,
foreign
control
wasn't
proved.
now,
this
brings
me
to
the
next
series
of
errors
in
the
construction
and
application
of
the
act
and
that
is
the
kind
of
evidence
that
the
board
and
the
court
below
did
rely
on
in
finding
that
the
petitioners
are
communist-action
organization
and
in
finding
the
existence
of
foreign
control.
this
evidence
is
summarized
in
one
paragraph
in
the
last
opinion
in
the
court
below
and
the
paragraph
is
quoted
on
pages
12
and
13
of
our
brief.
and
this
paragraph
and
the
board's
report
and
the
summary
to
the
board's
report
that
is
very
much
a
longer
line
from
the
paragraph,
show
that
the
determination
of
the
petitioner
is
up
--
is
under
soviet
control,
rests
on
three
bases.
the
first
basis
is
that
prior
to
1940,
petitioner
was
a
member
of
the
communist
international.
now,
during
this
period,
the
petitioner
bound
himself
to
comply
with
directions
of
the
international,
the
organization
with
--
which
is
its
affiliate
and
the
record
contains
rims
and
rims
of
evidence,
put
in
at
length
by
the
attorney
general,
concerning
this
pre-1940
period,
in
evidence
that
the
petitioner
received
direction
from
the
communist
international
that
it
received
financial
assistance
from
the
international,
that
it
was
supervised
by
and
reported
to
the
international.
now,
in
1940,
the
petitioner
disaffiliated
from
the
communist
international
and
thereafter,
it
had
absolutely
no
contact
with
it
of
any
kind.
this
disaffiliation
was
on
a
friendly
basis.
mr.
joseph
forer
oh
yes,
well,
you
--
you
can
read
this
record
from
beginning
to
end
and
you
will
find
no
dealings,
no
pointing
of
dealings
between
petitioner
and
the
communist
international
after
1940.
and
in
1943,
the
communist
international
went
out
of
existence,
so
there
certainly
couldn't
have
been
any
dealings
after
1943.
now,
this
disaffiliation
wasn't
on
any
hostile
basis,
but
that
the
petitioner
publicly
announced
that
it
was
disaffiliating
from
the
communist
international
and
that
it
thought
it
was
in
outrage
that
they'll
have
to
do
so,
but
--
but
it
was
disaffiliating
from
the
communist
international
in
order
to
avoid
registering
under
the
newly
enacted
(inaudible)
act,
then
they
made
a
public
statement
to
that
effect.
but
regardless
of
its
motivation,
the
fact
is
that
the
petitioner
did
disaffiliate
and
that
thereafter,
had
no
contacts
or
dealings
with
the
international
and
i've
listed
all
the
contacts
since
1940
where
i
--
i
spoke
them
out
with
the
soviet
union
and
--
and
they
amount
to
nothing
and
as
i
said,
the
international
itself
dissolved
in
1943.
but
the
board
just
raveled
in
this
evidence
of
the
pre-1940
period,
evidence
of
a
relationship
which
had
terminated
and
the
board
and
the
court
placed
an
overwhelming
reliance
on
this
pre-1940
evidence.
the
act
however
defines
a
communist-action
organization
in
terms
of
the
present
and
the
issue
therefore,
was
the
current
character
of
the
petitioner
and
character
behind
the
administrative
proceedings
or
at
least
after
the
enactment
of
the
act.
and
under
the
rule
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
cement
institute
case,
evidence
of
prior
transactions
and
that
is
transactions
prior
to
the
critical
period
and
in
this
case,
since
the
petition
--
since
the
case
was
started
so
soon
after
the
act
was
enacted,
we
can
talk
in
terms
of
pre-act
transactions,
evidence
of
pre-act
transactions
was
relevant.
only
where
you
had
a
continuing
situation,
where
the
pre-act
or
prior
transactions
tended
reasonably
to
show
or
illuminate
the
purpose
or
character
of
the
current
transactions,
in
this
case
the
post-act
transactions,
but
here
there
weren't
any
current
transactions
that
they
illuminate.
and
what
the
board
and
the
court
did,
was
to
treat
as
proof
of
a
present
relationship,
a
relationship
and
practices
which
had
been
discontinued
10
years
before
enactment
of
the
act
and
this
a
clear
error.
in
order
for
a
relist
at
pages
106
and
100
--
through
108,
all
of
the
post-act
matters
sighted
by
the
board's
report
and
since
had
2
or
3
pages,
i'm
not
going
to
read
them
but
i
just
say
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
examine
them
but
see
that
none
of
these
matters
of
any
tendency
to
show
the
petitioner
is
controlled
by
the
soviet
union
or
operates
to
advance
the
objective
prescribed
in
section
2
of
the
act,
in
fact,
they
are
certainly
irrelevant.
even
the
government
concedes
in
its
brief
and
i
quote
now
from
pages
268
to
269
that,
"the
government's
evidence
as
the
petitioner's
post-1950
activities
might
perhaps
not
independently
proved
it
to
be
a
communist-action
organization.”
now
the
government
goes
to
say
that
this
evidence
does
show
that
petitioners'
character
hasn't
substantially
changed,
since
to
the
days
of
the
communist
international.
now
of
course
that
the
post-act
evidence
is
that
well
maybe
it
--
it
doesn't
show
you're
under
foreign
control,
but
it
shows
you
haven't
changed
your
(inaudible).
now
of
course,
the
question
isn't
whether
petitioners'
character
changed
or
what
petitioners'
character
is.
the
question
is
what
is
the
relationship
shown
by
the
record
between
petitioner
and
soviet
union?
and
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
there
was
a
change
in
that
relationship
in
1940
as
a
result
of
an
end
to
petitioner's
disaffiliation
from
the
communist
international
or
by
that
disaffiliation
petitioner
removes
itself
from
the
only
possible
apparatus
of
control,
petitioner
removed
itself
from
any
further
contacts,
dealings
or
communication
with
the
soviet
union
and
after1940,
petitioner
no
longer
received
any
foreign
directive
or
had
any
meaningful
contact.
the
--
this
brings
me
to
the
other
two
bases
for
the
finding
against
petitioner.
the
first
one
is
discontinued
relationship,
discontinued
10
years
ago.
the
other
two
bases
are
those
which
lead
the
government
to
say
the
petitioner
hasn't
changed
its
character.
what
is
the
second
basis
that
is
shown
by
the
court
of
--
of
the
summary
of
the
court
below?
the
second
basis
is
that
if
the
petitioner
disaffiliated
from
the
communist
international,
it
continued
to
be
communist,
it
continued
to
adhere
to
and
it
still
adheres
to
the
principles
of
communism
and
not
only
the
principles
of
communism,
but
the
principle
of
communism
as
they
appear
in
the
theoretical
writing
of
marx,
engels,
lenin,
stalin
and
others
and
apparently,
these
writings
had
such
as
terrific
versatility
because
they
proved
a
case
under
the
smith
act.
they
proved
foreign
control
under
the
--
under
the
mccarran
act
and
it
is
true
that
after
1940,
the
petitioner
remained
a
communist
organization,
it
kept
the
name
communism
and
it
adhered
to
the
principles
of
communism.
and
it
is
those
writings
of
marx,
engels,
lenin
and
stalin
that
the
board
is
referring
to
when
it
says
in
its
modified
report
and
i
quote,
this
is
at
page
2409
of
the
record,
footnote
2,
"the
really
vital
part
of
the
attorney
general's
case,
is
documentary
evidence
which
to
considerable
extent,
means
relatively
little
to
our
illumination.”
so
the
first
basis
was
the
pre-1940
evidence,
the
second
basis
is
that
they
plead
in
communism
and
the
third
basis
was
the
so-called
non-deviation
evidence
that
mr.
abt
referred
to
before
lunch,
and
which
is
that
petitioners
consistently
agreed
with
soviet
views,
particularly
in
the
field
of
foreign
policy.
so
as
far
as
the
period
after
1940
is
concerned,
if
we
leave
aside
this
irrelevant
communist
international
stuff,
we're
left
solely
with
ideological
matters
as
a
foundation
for
the
board's
order,
namely
and
for
the
affirmance
below,
namely
that
petitioner
subscribed
to
communist
principles
or
to
marxism
and
leninism
agrees
with
the
soviet
union,
particularly
in
the
field
of
foreign
policy
and
thinks
that
the
soviet
union
is
the
great
power.
and
that
what
this
case
is
about,
that's
the
clear
and
present
danger,
that's
the
foreign
relation
nexus
that
is
supposed
to
justify
outlawing
the
petitioner
and
making
life
in
powerful
for
its
members
and
for
anybody
that
the
government
say
the
members
under
section
5.
and
the
court
below
recognized
this
fact
in
its
last
opinion,
because
it
said
in
explanation
of
this
conclusion
and
i
quote
and
this
is
the
quote,
“this
is
right
after
its
summary
to
the
other,
they
conclude,
“one
who
attaches
himself
by
intellectual
affiliation
to
a
cause,
assumes
the
name
of
the
cause,
puts
on
the
(inaudible)
of
the
cause
and
adheres
to
the
course
of
cause,
is
not
mistreated
if
it
be
inferred
prima
facie,
he
is
part
of
the
cause."
and
that's
saying
that
the
evidence
justified
the
court
in
finding
that
the
petitioner
has
an
intellectual
affiliation
with
the
cause
of
communism
in
that
instant.
now
we
don't
dispute
that
intellectual
affiliation.
we
don't
dispute
that
the
petitioner
has
assumed
the
name
of
the
cause
of
communism
that
it
adheres
the
communism
that
it
is
a
communist
organization
from
each
point
of
view,
but
we
do
say
that
this
intellectual
affiliation
of
the
communism
and
that's
all
there
is.
it
is
not
a
basis
under
the
terms
of
the
act
of
finding
that
petitioner
is
dominated
and
controlled
by
the
soviet
union.
and
if
it
were,
if
the
act
permitted
a
finding
foreign
control
and
the
subsequent
outlawry
to
be
based
on
that
kind
of
intellectual
affiliation,
we
say
it
would
be
a
gross
violation
of
the
first
amendment
to
outlaw
the
petitioners,
subject
its
members
to
the
sanctions
that
make
them
untouchables
because
of
their
intellectual
affiliation
to
communism
or
anything
else.
i'll
now,
pass
over
several
other
points
in
order
to
come
to
another
point
in
the
court's
application
of
the
act.
and
this
is
our
point
that
the
court
below
erred
in
refusing
to
remand
the
case,
because
of
the
board's
erroneous
reliance
on
a
finding
concerning
secret
practice.
and
the
situation
here
is
that
section
13
here
in
the
act,
sets
up
eight
criteria
which
the
board
is
directed
to
apply
in
determining
whether
an
accused
organization
meets
the
section
3
(3)
definition
of
the
communist-action
organization.
the
seventh
of
these
criterions,
section
13
(e)
(7),
is
the
extent
to
which
the
accused
organization
engages
in
secret
practices
for
the
purpose
of
concealing
foreign
control
or
for
the
purpose
of
promoting
the
organization's
objective.
engaging
in
secret
practices
for
other
purposes,
doesn't
meet
these
criteria.
now,
in
its
original
report,
the
board
found
that
petitioner
engages
in
secret
practices
for
both
of
the
purposes
stated
in
section
13
(e)
(7)
and
this
was
one
of
the
findings
on
which
it
based
its
order.
one
of
the
eight
findings
that
made
eight
findings
under
--
under
section
13
(e)
all
of
them
adverse
the
petitioner
and
then
it
issued
its
order
and
this
was
one
of
the
findings.
now,
when
this
got
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
its
first
review
and
its
first
opinion,
the
court
appeals
held
that
the
purpose
finding
in
the
board
was
not
supported
by
the
evidence
and
it
said
we
strike
the
finding
and
the
purposes.
we
don't
think
that
the
evidence
disclosed
as
a
clearly
revealed
purpose
either
way.
now,
the
effect
of
this
was
to
make
the
secret
practices,
purpose
solicited
from
a
legal
point
of
view,
but
it
made
the
secret
practices
standard
of
section
13
(e)
(7)
inapplicable
to
the
petitioner.
the
court
didn't
say
we
were
right
when
we
--
we
had
introduced
evidence
as
the
purpose
in
the
secret
practices,
was
in
order
to
protect
the
members
of
the
communist
party
from
unjust
and
unconstitutional
persecution.
the
court
said,
well,
i
will
say,
you're
right
but
the
board
certainly
didn't
do
in
this
case.
so
that
meant
that
13
(e)
(7),
one
of
the
eight
key
findings
of
the
board
was
out.
but
although
the
court
of
appeals
thus
reversed
the
board
on
the
one
of
its
eight
key
findings,
nevertheless,
it
affirmed
the
board's
order.
mr.
joseph
forer
this
is
on
the
first
review
and
we
immediately
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
saying
that,
you
can't
do
that.
they
denied
the
petition
for
rehearing
without
any
observation.
and
when
we
took
the
first
affirmance,
when
we
came
here
on
our
first
petition
for
certiorari,
one
of
the
questions
we
raised
was,
wasn't
it
wrong
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
affirm
rather
than
to
remand?
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
the
first
review,
they
had
not
only
stricken
the
finding
on
secret
practices
but
they
had
also
modified
another
one
of
the
eight
findings.
well,
this
court
reversed
the
court
of
appeals
on
other
grounds.
as
you
know
the
case
went
back
to
the
board
and
you
never
got
with
its
question
about
the
effect
the
board's
erroneous
finding
on
secret
practices.
but
when
the
case
went
back
and
in
the
subsequent
remand
proceedings,
the
board
deleted
from
the
record
huge
quantities
of
evidence,
including
much
evidence
which
it
had
considered
unfavorable
to
petitioner
on
the
subject
of
secret
practice.
no
new
evidence
on
the
subject
was
added
at
all,
so
the
record
on
secret
practice
was
now
better
for
us
than
it
has
before,
because
it
has
been
the
lead
any
of
our
evidence,
if
the
lead
allowed
the
government
(inaudible).
nevertheless,
the
board
retained
in
the
modified
report,
one
of
the
stricken
purpose
findings.
it
yielded
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
extent
of
abandoning
one
of
its
original
true
purpose
finding.
it
now
disclaimed
making
any
finding
that
the
secret
practices
were
engaged
in
for
the
purpose
of
concealing
foreign
control,
but
contrary
to
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals,
it
repeated
and
restated
its
finding
without
even
giving
the
court
of
appeals
the
deference
of
dimension,
it
repeated
and
reinstated
its
findings
that
petitioner
engages
in
secret
practices
for
the
purpose
of
promoting
its
supposedly
sinister
objective.
so
the
result
was
that
the
criterion
of
section
13
(e)
(7)
was
again
made
applicable
for
the
petitioners'
disadvantage
and
it
was
just
as
applicable
whether
they
had
one
purpose
or
both
purposes.
when
the
case
went
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
we
called
this
--
the
attention
of
the
court
and
court
said,
the
board
was
wrong
before
and
the
board
is
wrong
again
and
the
court
repeated
its
holding
that
the
board's
finding
was
not
supported
by
the
evidence
nevertheless,
it
again
affirmed
the
board's
order
in
(inaudible)
mr.
joseph
forer
on
the
grounds
that
once
a
court,
a
reviewing
court,
has
held
invalid
a
key
finding
on
which
an
administrative
order
is
based
in
part,
the
reviewing
court,
in
this
case
the
court
of
appeals,
is
obliged
to
remand
the
case
to
the
board,
to
the
administrative
agency
for
administrative
predetermination
on
the
basis
of
correct
findings
and
not
the
substitute
self
for
the
agency
by
saying,
while
even
if
the
--
the
basis
on
which
the
agency
acted
was
wrong,
nevertheless,
we
think
there
is
enough
in
the
record.
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
i
said
that.
mr.
joseph
forer
oh,
you
mean
on
what
ground
the
court
of
appeals
turned
us
down?
mr.
joseph
forer
oh,
well,
they
turned
us
down
and
they
said
there's
no
more
need
to
remand
it
now
than
there
was
in
the
first
place.
they
said
we
didn't
remand
it
before,
therefore
there's
no
need
--
need
to
remand
it
now.
they
never
told
us
why
it
didn't
they
remand
it
before.
so
they
still
gave
no
explanation,
if
i
--
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
you
before
mr.
justice
black,
but
they
gave
no
reason.
they
just
said,
we
don't
see
anymore
--
say
we
didn't
remand
before,
why
should
we
remand
now.
mr.
joseph
forer
they
didn't
say
that.
presumably
that's
--
mr.
joseph
forer
where
is
what
they
said,
the
second
time,
you
mean?
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
at
page
126
of
this
volume
of
opinions,
appendices
to
the
petition
where
we
have
the
--
where
we
everything
collected
--
mr.
joseph
forer
page
126
and
this
is
what
they
say.
in
our
original
opinion
on
this
matter,
we
struck
as
not
supported
by
preponderance
to
the
evidence,
a
finding
respecting
the
purposes
of
the
secret
practices
of
the
party.
the
board
has
let
the
finding
remain
and
its
modified
report
on
second
remand.
the
party
says
the
court
must
therefore
again
remand
to
the
board,
for
the
administrative
redetermination
in
the
light
of
the
striking
to
this
finding.
we
do
not
see
why
we
should
so.
we
did
not
find
it
necessary
to
reverse
the
order
of
the
board
or
to
remand
when
we
first
struck
the
finding.
no
new
evidence
on
the
point
has
been
added
since
then
and
so
we
adhere
to
our
first
conclusion,
but
the
necessity
for
remand
is
now
no
greater
than
it
was
and
we
think
the
board
is
entitled
to
adhere
to
its
view
on
the
point
until
our
view
of
it
has
been
tested
in
the
supreme
court.
now,
we
think
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
did,
usurp
the
function
of
the
board
and
violated
the
principles
stated
by
this
court
in
the
chenery
case
that
the
grounds,
“the
grounds
upon
which
an
administrative
order
must
be
judged
are
those
upon
which
the
record
discloses
that
agency's
action
was
based,
and
that
administrative
order
cannot
be
upheld
unless
the
grounds
upon
which
the
agency
acted
or
those
upon
which
its
action
can
be
sustained."
and
the
situation
here
is
the
same
as
in
the
virginia
electric
and
power
case,
where
the
court
remanded
a
labor
board
order
for
administrative
redetermination
because
the
board's
ultimate
conclusion
rested
in
part
on
the
finding
which
had
insufficient
evidentiary
support
and
the
court
did
so
even
though
it
expressly
recognized
that
the
labor
board
might
have
reached,
astoundedly
had
reached
the
same
ultimate
conclusion
without
the
erroneous
finding.
now,
the
government
argues
in
brief
that
a
remand
is
not
required
because
it
says
the
board
did
not
attach
much
importance
to
its
secrecy
finding
and
reaching
its
ultimate
conclusion.
and
the
argument
is
wrong
legally
in
the
light
of
chenery
and
virginia
electric
and
power,
but
it's
also
a
wrong
action.
in
the
first
place,
the
board
is
a
tribunal,
never
said
that
its
finding
on
secret
practices
was
not
essential
and
never
said
that
its
finding
on
secret
practice
wasn't
important
for
the
result.
that's
just
what
the
government
is
saying
now
belatedly
as
a
litigant.
and
it's
significant
that
the
board
as
a
tribunal,
refused
to
make
that
finding
any
--
refused
to
make
any
such
disclaimer
even
though
it
knew
when
it
repeated
it,
the
offending
finding
that
it
was
contradicting
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
we
were
going
to
make
exactly
the
same
argument
that
i
am
making
at
this
moment.
they
could've
taken
most
of
the
curse
of
the
matter
off
if
they
had
just
said,
well,
we
still
adhere
to
this
view,
we
still
make
this
finding,
but
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
anyhow.
they
didn't
say
that.
in
the
second
place,
this
isn't
just
an
ordinary
subsidiary
finding.
this
is
a
finding
under
one
of
eight
statutory
criteria
established
by
section
13
(e),
you
--
so
if
you
disparage
the
finding,
you
disparage
the
statutory
criteria.
in
this
situation,
an
advocation
is
--
is
worst
than
that,
because
of
the
eight
findings
under
this
criteria,
the
government
now
defends
the
order
on
the
bases
of
only
5
of
the
8,
one
of
which
is
the
finding
on
secrecy
and
which
the
secrecy
finding
that
makes
the
difference
between
a
plurality
of
section
13
(e)
finding
against
the
petitioner
or
in
even
division.
and
finally,
it's
just
impossible
for
me
to
see
why
the
board
devoted
19
closely
printed
pages
in
the
modified
report
that
the
subject
had
secret
practices,
they
considered
the
entire
subject
to
the
unimportant
and
unessential.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
we
think
they're
all
bad.
now,
it's
true
that
there
is
some
question
on
the
deportation
statute
because
of
what
i
considered
the
most
important
decision
of
this
court
in
galvan
against
press,
but,
we
--
we
think
they're
all
bad.
there
are
some
--
the
alien
sanctions
of
course,
run
into
the
problem
that
aliens
may
not
have
quite
as
many
rights
as
a
citizen.
the
last
point
i
will
argue
and
i
hope
i
can
finish
it,
is
also
a
remand
point.
and
it
is
that
the
board
and
the
court
below
erred
in
reducing
to
strike
all
the
testimony
of
the
attorney
general's
witness
louis
budenz.
at
the
original
board
hearing
in
1952,
budenz
testified
among
other
things,
the
two
supposed
incidents
which
had
come
to
be
known
in
this
litigation
as
the
(inaudible)
in
the
wiener
conversation.
i
--
i
will
save
time.
i'm
not
going
into
what
the
testimony
was,
but
there
were
two
important
subjects.
on
cross-examination
budenz
said,
he
has
reported
these
incidents
to
the
fbi
orally
and
didn't
know
whether
or
to
what
extent
the
fbi
had
refused
them
their
right.
so
we
move
for
the
production
of
these
statements
or
reports
made
by
defense
of
the
fbi
about
the
historic
letter
in
the
wiener
conversation.
the
attorney
general
or
his
representatives
objected
to
the
motions
and
the
board
denied
that
motion.
when
the
case
went
back
to
the
board
after
the
remand,
we
again
moved
for
the
production
of
budenz's
reports
to
the
fbi
on
the
(inaudible)
matters
and
this
time
added
the
alternative
that
at
least
the
board
inspect
them
in
camera.
again
the
attorney
general
objected,
again
the
board
sustained
the
objection.
so
we
complained
about
these
rulings
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
government
in
its
brief
from
the
court
of
appeals,
defended
the
rulings
on
the
grounds
that
there
weren't
any
written
reports
by
budenz
on
these
two
matters,
but
at
most,
only
some
summaries
prepared
by
the
fbi
and
not
seen
by
the
defense.
on
the
basis
of
this
representation,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
we
weren't
entitled
to
the
statements.
we
filed
the
petition
for
rehearing
but
this
time
for
the
first
time
it
occurred
to
the
government
that
instead
of
making
the
representations
that
weren't
any
reports,
perhaps,
government
counsel
should
check
with
the
fbi
first.
so,
they
checked
with
the
fbi
which
probably
informed
them
that
the
fbi
had
recorded
verbatim
days
and
days
of
interview
with
defense
including
a
material
which
would
be
relevant
for
the
subjects
of
wiener
and
(inaudible)
matter,
so
then
the
government
counsel
filed
a
memorandum
which
they
informed
the
court
of
appeals
that
they
had
finally
checked
with
the
fbi,
they
had
learned
that
the
fbi
had
the
verbatim
recording
and
then
told
the
court
that
--
that
they
thought
that
--
that
under
the
jencks
rule,
we
were
entitled
to
get
those
portions
of
the
recording
which
related
to
the
wiener
(inaudible),
so
the
court
changed
this
ruling.
mr.
joseph
forer
already.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes
--
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
jencks'
case
has
been
decided
even
the
jencks'
statute
was
enacted.
now
the
court
changed
this
ruling
so
as
the
--
require
the
production
of
these
statements.
the
case
was
going
back
for
other
purposes
anyway.
so
when
the
case
got
back
to
the
board
level
we
cut
excerpts
from
budenz's
talks
with
the
fbi
which
are
relevant
to
the
(inaudible)
and
wiener
testimony.
it
became
apparent
to
us.
i
think
it
becomes
apparent
to
anybody
that
looks
at
them
objectively,
not
only
that
they
contradicted
this
testimony
on
this
matter,
but
that
they
indicated
a
pattern
typical
of
this
witness
that
he
had
deliberately
concocted
testimony
that
fit
the
particular
needs
of
the
occasion.
so
we
said,
call
budenz
back,
we
call
him
because
now,
we
wanted
to
be
able
to
cross-examine
him
with
the
aid
of
the
--
these
statements.
then
hearing
the
examiner,
who
is
the
member
of
the
board,
ruled
that
we
were
entitled
budenz
recalled
for
this
purpose.
then
it
turns
out
that
budenz
had
a
lasting
illness,
he
was
too
sick
to
be
examined.
so
we
never
did
get
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine
with
the
aid
of
the
statements,
despite
the
fact
that
by
now
it
was
freely
and
finally
conceded
that
we
had
been
entitled
for
that
opportunity
when
we
had
first
asked
them
that
there
has
been
error
to
deny
the
opportunity
in
the
first
place.
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
we
had
crossed
examined
them
on
those
two
matters,
but
we
didn't
have
these
valuable
materials
that
make
them
out
of
the
(inaudible).
we
didn't
have
it.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes,
so
we
moved
that
because
we
have
been
the
--
the
pride
of
our
right
to
cross-examination,
we
move
that
all
of
the
budenz's
testimony
be
stricken.
our
motion
was
denied
by
the
board
but
the
board
did
strike
those
parts
of
budenz's
testimony
which
related
to
the
(inaudible)
and
wiener
matter.
it
kept
the
rest
of
budenz's
testimony
in
and
it
made
findings
based
on
it.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
this
ruling,
judge
bazalon
dissented.
and
the
question
is
therefore,
what
are
the
consequences
of
a
deprivation
--
of
this
deprivation
of
cross-examination
caused
by
the
witness'
death
or
lasting
illness?
such
authority
there,
as
there
is
on
the
subject,
is
summarized
by
weight
more
to
this
effect.
first,
if
the
witness
or
the
party
wigmore
has
any
sort
of
responsibility
for
the
deprivation,
then
all
of
the
witnesses'
direct
testimony
must
be
stricken.
the
illustration
given
by
wigmore
is
a
case,
where
a
party
obtained
the
postponement
to
direct
examination
and
the
witness
died
or
became
sick
during
the
recess.
second,
even
if
the
party
offering
the
witness
has
no
responsibility
for
the
deprivation,
nevertheless,
all
of
the
witnesses'
testimony
must
be
stricken
if
the
deprived
party
suffers
a
material
loss
from
the
deprivation.
if
this
rule
is
applied
we
say,
it
is
clear
that
all
of
budenz's
testimony
should
have
been
stricken
for
each
of
the
two
reasons
given
by
wigmore.
to
get
to
the
second
thing
first,
by
being
deprived
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine
this
witness
with
the
aid
of
these
two
statements
which
showed
contradictions
and
consistencies
and
perjury
on
these
two
vital
matters,
we
were
denied
the
opportunity
to
discredit
him
on
other
matters
and
to
show
that
he
belonged
in
the
same
category
as
the
government's
three
other
perjurers
who
appeared
in
this
case
crouch,
johnson
and
matusow,
because
we
were
deprived
from
that
opportunity
to
discredit
him
generally
and
because
the
board
nevertheless,
went
ahead
and
made
important
findings
based
on
his
testimony,
we
suffered
a
material
loss
from
being
deprived
of
--
of
this
opportunity.
secondly
and
this
is
the
first
reason
given
by
wigmore,
the
responsibility
for
the
deprivation
does
rest
on
the
attorney
general
and
the
board.
it
was
the
attorney
general
who
made
ill
founded
objections
to
our
production
demands.
it
was
the
board
which
made
erroneous
ruling
to
sustaining
these
objections
and
that
caused
the
deprivation.
moreover,
the
attorney
general
had
an
additional
responsibility
because
he
withheld
the
fact
that
the
fbi
had
the
yet
--
had
the
budenz
statements
in
its
possession
until
it
was
too
late
to
recall
it
then.
for
this
reasons,
all
of
budenz's
testimony
should've
been
stricken.
i
don't
know
if
we
have
any
time
left
but
we
too,
will
reserve
it.
thank
you.
