mr.
abt,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
forer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
answer
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
--
did
you
give
those
to
the
first
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
automatically
--
general
is
here
automatically
the
man
becomes
subject
to
prosecution
to
find.
the
mere
fact
that
he
had
--
the
he
admits
that
he
--
he
has
in
his
(inaudible),
he
--
he
then
subjects
himself
as
a
according
to
theory
he's
had
been
hearing
here
a
lot
there
so,
he
becomes
an
active
member
of
the
party
and
he
can
be
prosecuted
for
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
something
that's
in
the
reports
might
--
might
lead
to
--
to
his
incrimination
but
the
very
fact
that
his
admission
in
filing
the
claim
makes
him
subject
to
these
sanctions
and
to
prosecution
for
as
you
say,
under
the
smith
act,
for
being
a
member.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
--
mr.
davis
told
us
the
man
even
paid
dues.
he
was
more
than
a
per
se
member
that
he
was
then
a
member
who
came
within
the
purview
of
the
--
of
the
statute.
now,
here's
a
man
who
--
who
has
knowledge
and
--
and
has
documents
and
he
--
he
registers
for
the
party
and
wouldn't
that
be
more
substantial
than
the
just
paying
dues?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
leaving
your
form
out,
do
you
think
general
that
that
--
that
that
would
sufficient
under
the
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
nor
can
it
be
raised
of
any
other
time,
unless
they
refuse
to
file
the
claims,
they
remember
is
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
versus
subversive
activities
control
board.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
general,
if
we
--
should
--
if
the
court
should
disagree
with
you
on
the
question
as
to
whether
the
first
amendment
problems
and
the
fifth
amendment
problems
aren't
before
us
at
the
present
time.
suppose
we
should
conclude
that
all
of
those
problems
are
before
us,
would
we
then
proceed
with
the
--
with
the
--
your
separability
theory
in
accordance
with
the
case
you
have
cited
and
still
do
justice
to
the
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
if
i
can
--
i
think
you
may
have
to,
unless
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
unless
you
have
to
(inaudible)
please
the
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
general,
my
point
is
--
is
this
that
suppose
the
court
disagrees
with
you
on
that
and
believes
that
both
refers
to
the
fifth
amendment
problems
of
the
officers
and
members
of
the
organization
are
before
us
as
they
were
in
naacp
then
would
you
still
say
that
--
that
we
could
impose
the
separability
clause
in
a
manner
that
you
have
indicated
what
was
done
under
the
--
the
case
you
cited.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
didn't
think
there
are
any
fifth
amendment
problems
in
that
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
because
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
didn't
really
believe
there
were
any
first
amendment
problems
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
the
case
either.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
and
my
point
is
specifically
this.
suppose
this
court
was
of
the
opinion
that
those
problems
are
before
us
in
this
case,
can
we
then
adopt
the
reasoning
of
that
case
in
this
one,
and
determine
separability.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
so
understood
you,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we're
talking
about
self-incrimination
in
this
case
throughout,
not
any
other
portion
it
has
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
abt.
