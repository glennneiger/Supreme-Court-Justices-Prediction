mr.
john
j.
abt
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
for
review
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
affirming
an
order
of
the
subversive
activities
control
board
that
the
petitioner
register
as
a
communist-action
organization
under
section
7
of
the
subversive
activities
control
act.
the
act
was
passed
over
the
presence
veto
in
september
1950,
shortly
after
the
outbreak
of
war
in
korea.
the
order
of
the
board
was
issued
in
april
1953
after
a
hearing
on
a
petition
by
the
attorney
general
and
was
accompanied
by
a
report
in
which
the
board
stated
its
findings
as
to
the
facts.
on
the
first
review,
the
court
of
appeals
held
the
act
constitutional
and
affirmed
the
board's
order.
judge
bazelon
dissented
holding
the
act
unconstitutional
because
it
violates
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
this
court
refers
to
1956
without
reaching
any
of
the
other
questions
presented
because
of
the
denial
below
of
the
petitioners'
motion
for
leave
to
adduce
evidence
that
three
witnesses
called
by
the
attorney
general
for
perjury.
upon
the
remand
of
the
case
to
the
board,
the
attorney
general
did
not
contest
the
petitioners'
allegations
of
perjury.
accordingly,
the
board
expunged
the
testimony
of
these
three
witnesses.
after
further
proceedings,
the
board
issued
a
modified
report
and
a
recommendation
that
its
order
be
affirmed.
on
the
second
review
in
1958,
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
the
case
to
the
board
because
of
the
latter's
denial
of
petitioners'
motions
for
the
production
of
statements
to
government
agencies
by
to
of
the
attorney
general's
witnesses.
after
further
proceedings
before
the
board,
the
board
issued
its
modified
report
on
second
remand
and
again
recommended
affirmance
of
its
registration
order.
the
court
below
affirmed.
judge
bazelon
again
dissenting
adhered
to
its
original
position
on
the
constitutional
question
and
further
held
that
several
procedural
errors
required
another
remand
to
the
board.
the
case
presents
to
this
court
questions
of
the
highest
public
importance
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
subversive
activities
control
act
and
its
construction
and
application.
additional
questions
relate
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
and
to
what,
in
our
review,
were
for
major
procedural
errors
by
the
board
of
the
court
below.
the
first
point
that
i
shall
argue
is
that
the
act,
on
its
face
and
as
applied,
violates
the
first
amendment.
as
i
shall
show
under
the
guise
of
a
registration
statute,
the
act
represents
an
attempt
without
precedent
in
this
country
to
enforce
conformity
by
suppressing,
advocacy,
association
and
collective
activity
for
wholly
legitimate
purposes.
the
act
provides
for
proceedings
before
the
board
initiated
on
petitions
of
the
attorney
general
to
determine
whether
accused
groups
are
communist-action,
communist-front
or
communist-infiltrated
organizations
but
to
the
act,
denominates
collectively
as
communist
organizations.
a
communist-action
organization
is
defined
in
section
3
(3)
of
the
act
as
an
organization
which,
and
i
quote,
"one
is
substantially
directed,
dominated
or
controlled
by
the
foreign
government
or
foreign
organization
controlling
the
world
communist
movement,"
referred
to
in
section
2
of
this
title
and
two,
"operates
primarily
to
advance
the
objectives
of
such
world
communist
movement,"
as
referred
to
in
section
2
of
this
title.
section
2,
which
is,
of
course,
item
of
section
3
by
virtue
of
the
section
3
definition,
section
2
finds
that
the
world
communist
movement
referred
to
in
the
definition
is
directed
and
controlled
by
a
foreign
power,
operates
through
the
medium
of
a
worldwide
communist
organization
composed
of
communist-action
organizations
and
has
as
its
purpose
the
establishment
of
what
the
act
calls
a
communist
totalitarian
dictatorship
in
all
the
countries
throughout
the
world
by
means
of
espionage,
sabotage,
terrorism,
treachery,
deceit,
infiltration
to
other
groups
and
any
other
means
deemed
necessary.
communist-front
and
communist-infiltrated
organizations
are
defined
in
terms
of
their
control
by
a
communist-action
organization
or
its
members
and
by
their
purpose
of
giving
aid
or
support
to
a
communist-action
organization.
communist-action
and
communist-front
organizations
are
required
to
register
as
such
with
the
attorney
general
when
a
registration
order
becomes
final
upon
the
exhaustion
of
judicial
review.
communist-infiltrated
organizations
are
not
required
to
register
that
are
denied
the
benefits
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
registration
statement
of
a
communist-action
organization
must
list
the
names
of
its
officers
and
all
of
its
members
give
a
detailed
financial
accounting
and
list
of
printing,
mimeographing
and
similar
duplicating
facilities.
registration
statements
are
open
for
public
inspection
and
are
required
to
be
kept
current
by
annual
reports.
members
who
are
not
listed
in
the
registration
statement
of
the
organization
are
under
a
duty
to
register
themselves
after
an
administrative
determination
of
their
membership.
the
failure
of
the
officers
to
register
the
organization
or
the
members
to
register
themselves
is
punishable
by
five
years
imprisonment
and
a
$10,000
fine
cumulative
for
each
day
that
the
failure
to
register
continues.
in
view
of
the
findings
of
section
2,
a
final
registration
order
commence
the
organization
to
stigmatize
itself
and
its
members
or
the
members
to
stigmatize
themselves
has
participants
in
what
amounts
to
a
foreign
controlled
seditious
conspiracy.
a
final
registration
order
also
automatically
invokes
a
series
of
tripling
sanctions
against
the
organization
and
its
members.
all
these
sanctions,
it's
important
to
point
out,
become
operative
whether
or
not
the
organization
or
its
members
register
in
compliance
with
the
registration
order.
the
sanctions
are
the
following.
first,
the
organization
must
label
all
publications
which
it
distributes
through
the
mails
as
those
are
a
communist
organization.
its
broadcasts
and
telecasts
must
be
preceded
by
a
similar
identifying
announcement.
this
requirement,
in
our
view,
was
plainly
acquire
--
requirement
of
self-defamation
applies
to
all
of
the
organizations,
publications
and
broadcasts,
no
matter
how
legitimate
their
contempt
maybe.
mr.
john
j.
abt
section
10,
your
honor.
second,
it
is
unlawful
for
members
of
the
organization
to
hold
any
non-elective
federal
office
to
hold
employment
of
any
kind
in
an
enterprise
which
the
secretary
of
defense
has
listed
as
a
defense
facility
or
to
hold
any
office
or
employment
in
a
labor
union.
these
provisions
may
close
a
door
to
virtually
all
employment
opportunities
for
members.
third,
it
is
unlawful
for
members
to
apply
for
or
use
passports
for
any
purpose
including
the
most
innocent.
fourth,
it
is
unlawful
for
employees
of
the
government
or
of
the
defense
facilities
to
contribute
funds
or
services
to
the
organization
for
any
purpose
whatsoever
or
even
to
subscribe
to
the
publications
of
the
organization.
fifth,
naturalized
citizens
who
join
the
organization
within
five
years
after
naturalization
are
subject
to
loss
of
citizenship.
alien
members
are
to
be
excluded
or
deported
and
may
not
be
naturalized.
sixth
and
finally,
the
organization
and
its
employees
are
excluded
from
a
social
security
system.
the
sanctions
of
the
act,
with
reference
to
labeling,
employment,
passports
and
contributions
to
the
organization
are
all
enforceable
by
the
onerous
criminal
penalties
imposed
by
section
15
of
the
act.
all
of
these
sanctions
on
the
members
are
imposed
exclusively
because
of
their
membership
without
regard
to
their
personal
influence
--
innocence
or
lack
of
personal
knowledge
of
any
wrong
doing
whatsoever
on
the
part
of
the
organization.
mr.
john
j.
abt
not
entirely,
your
honor.
mr.
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
--
mr.
forer
has
been
to
argue
that
point.
i'd
like
to
refer
the
analysis
(inaudible).
mr.
john
j.
abt
qualification
of
--
in
some
aspects,
they
must
have
notice
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
--
of
the
--
or
not
notice
or
knowledge
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
--
that
an
order
has
been
issued
for
registration
order
but
no
personal
knowledge
that
the
organization
has
been
engaged
in
wrongdoing.
the
sanctions
imposed
by
the
act
on
front
organizations
and
their
members
differ
from
notes
that
i
have
described
with
preference
to
communist-action
organizations
only
in
a
few
ameliorating
details.
in
the
case
of
the
petitioner,
the
member
sanctions
are
not
implying
to
persons
who
are
its
members
by
any
conventional
standards.
they
extend
to
a
host
of
individuals
who
may
be
found
to
be
members
under
section
5
of
the
communist
control
act,
which
establishes
such
vague
and
comprehensive
standards
for
determining
membership
in
the
communist
party
and
that
we
show
in
our
brief
and
argue
it
here
almost
anyone
can
be
found
to
be
a
member.
a
final
registration
order
against
petitioner
will
have
further
consequences.
any
person
who
signs
a
registration
statement
or
whose
name
is
listed
in
it
becomes
a
candidate
for
prosecution
under
the
smith
act
and
the
extravagantly
vague
crime
created
by
section
4
(a)
of
this
act
of
conspiring,
"to
perform
any
act
which
would
substantially
contribute
to
the
establishment
of
a
totalitarian
dictatorship
under
foreign
control".
furthermore,
by
branding
the
organization
and
its
members
as
treasonable
conspirators,
registration
order
defames
them,
makes
them
social
outcasts
and
threatens
their
ability
to
earn
a
livelihood.
finally,
the
registration
order
will
make
it
prohibitive
for
other
groups
and
individuals
to
associate
with
the
petitioner
or
its
members
or
even
to
advocate
legitimate
social
or
economic
use
which
they
support.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
didn't
say
made
it
illegal,
your
honor,
i
said
it
made
it
dangerous
for
them
to
do
so
because
by
doing
so,
first
of
all,
they
may
make
themselves
--
themselves
members
under
the
evidentiary
indicia
of
section
5
of
the
communist
control
act.
and
in
addition,
any
group
that
engages
in
such
association
or
advocate
views
similar
to
those
advocated
by
the
communist-action
organization,
the
petitioner
risks
condemnation
under
the
act
as
a
front
or
infiltrated
organization
under
the
act's
standards
for
determining
what
front
and
the
infiltrated
organizations
are.
the
consequences
of
all
these
are
at
the
registration
order,
quarantines
the
organization
and
--
and
its
members.
registration
order
also
effectively
deters
the
whole
people
from
even
considering,
later
on
espousing
any
views
of
the
organization
advocates.
in
the
light
of
all
these
consequences
of
a
registration
order,
it
is
idle
to
pretend,
as
a
government
does
here,
that
the
act
it
is
nothing
but
a
simple
disclosure
statute.
no
disclosure
statute,
a
legitimate
disclosure
statute
defames
and
imposes
destructive
penalties
upon
those
who
complied
by
making
disclosure
nor
does
it
make
registration
an
act
of
self-exposure
to
criminal
and
civil
liabilities
created
by
the
legislation
itself.
the
act
makes
that
we
think
it
was
obviously
intended
to
make
registration
impossible
for
if
the
organization
registers,
it
destroys
itself
and
jeopardizes
the
livelihood
and
liberty
of
its
members,
contributors
and
those
who
do
business
with
it
by
listing
their
names
for
public
scrutiny
as
members,
contributors
or
persons
having
business
dealings
with
a
foreign
control
seditious
conspiracy.
for
member
registers,
he
destroys
himself
under
the
sanctions
of
the
act.
on
the
other
hand,
failure
to
register
exposes
the
officers
and
members
an
astronomical
cumulative
penalty.
the
order
thus
offers
the
organization
or
its
members
a
hobson's
choice
between
suicide
by
registration
and
governmental
execution
for
non-registration.
accordingly,
the
act
does
not
contemplate
really
that
the
order
--
a
registration
order
will
be
complied
with.
consequence,
the
order
will
not
and
can't
produce
information
because
nobody
can
register
under
it
and
survive,
but
it
results
in
its
proscription.
its
true
function
is
to
outlaw
the
petitioner,
lay
a
basis
for
the
mass
prosecution
of
its
members
and
establish
the
foundation
for
proscribing
other
organizations
as
fronts
or
infiltrators.
by
outlawing
the
petitioner,
the
act
does
not
merely
deter
but
proscribes
all
advocacy
by
and
association
with
it.
congress
thought
to
reconcile
these
consequences
with
the
first
amendment
by
finding
in
section
2
that
the
act
was
necessary
to
guard
against,
"a
clear
and
present
danger
to
the
security
of
the
united
states,"
at
section
215.
the
act
cannot
be
justified
on
this
ground.
first
place,
it
authorizes
the
entry
of
a
registration
order
against
an
organization
which
has
not
been
shown
be
endangering
the
national
security
in
any
way
whatsoever.
this
appears
in
section
3
of
the
act,
section
3
(3)
i
should
say,
which
defines
a
communist-action
organization
in
terms
of
two
characteristics.
first
characteristic
is
that
the
organization
is
under
soviet
control,
substantially
directed
and
dominated
and
controlled
by
the
foreign
government
controlling
the
world
communist.
but
the
existence
of
foreign
control
or
control
by
the
soviet
union
cannot
of
itself
establish
that
the
organization
is
a
threat
to
the
national
security
if
in
fact
the
only
activities
of
the
organization
engages
in
are
innocent,
lawful
and
peaceable.
this
would
seem
to
be
true
under
any
conception
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
"control"
but
certainly
true
under
the
conception
adopted
by
the
board
and
the
court
below
and
urged
by
the
government
in
its
brief
here
which,
as
mr.
forer
will
show
in
his
portion
of
the
argument
to
satisfy
by
nothing
more
than
voluntary
ideological
adherence
to
use
in
policies
of
the
soviet
union.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
haven't
come
to
the
purposes
of
that,
your
honor.
i
think
in
one
of
the
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
said
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
--
a
mere
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
said
the
mere
fact
that
the
organization
is
under
the
direction
of
a
foreign
country
without
respect
to
what
the
--
what
the
domestic
organization
is
doing
in
this
country
is
not
a
sufficient
constitutional
basis
to
permit
the
proscription
of
that
organization.
and
i
now
want
to
come
to
the
second
portion
of
the
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
based
on
the
first
amendment,
yes,
your
honor.
you
can't
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
--
we're
saying
that
you
can't
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
abt
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
we
stand
on
that
argument,
yes,
sir.
we
say
that
--
we
say
that
--
as
i've
said,
under
any
conception
of
the
word
"control"
that
is
to
say,
if
there
were
--
even
if
(inaudible)
shown
in
this
case
or
the
act
were
construed
to
require
a
showing
that
the
soviet
union
have
the
power
to
enforce
its
orders
or
demands
on
the
local
organization.
we
say
that
that's
obviously
true
under
the
conception
of
control
which
the
court
below
adopted
the
--
and
which
the
board
is
urging
here
which
dispenses
with
any
element
of
power
to
enforce
complaints
with
the
foreign
countries'
desires
and
rest
it
says
of
control
exist
merely
where
there's
a
voluntary
ideological
conformity.
i
don't
want
to
get
into
that
question
because
(inaudible)
in
our
argument
further
but
i
just
note
that
in
answer
to
your
--
your
honor's
question.
i
now
want
to
come
to
the
second
element
of
the
section
3
(3)
definition,
which
requires
proof
that
the
organization
operates
and
i
quote,
"primarily
to
advance
the
objectives
of
such
world
communist
movement
as
referred
to
in
section
2."
now,
section
2
contains
lengthy
findings
about
the
evils
of
the
world
communist
movement
but
neither
it
nor
any
other
provision
of
the
act
defines
the
objectives
of
the
movement.
there's
no
definition
in
the
act
of
the
objectives
of
the
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
i
am
coming
to
that,
your
honor,
because
i
think
that's
all
there
is.
what
i
say
is
that
the
objectives
are
left
to
be
inferred
from
what
you
can
read
in
to
--
in
to
or
out
of
section
2.
mr.
john
j.
abt
subsection
1,
that's
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
as
--
as
we
read
the
act,
and
i
take
it
as
your
honor
would
read
it.
the
objectives
of
the
world
communist
movement,
referred
to
in
section
3
(3),
are
synonymous
with
what
section
2
(1)
calls
the
purposes
of
the
movement.
that
is
the
establishment
of
a
communist
totalitarian
dictatorship
in
the
countries
throughout
the
world.
now,
if
this
is
all
of
the
objectives
element
of
section
3
(3)
comprises
that
is,
the
objective
of
world
communist
movements
is
to
establish
a
communist
totalitarian
dictatorship
in
the
countries
throughout
the
world
then
an
organization
can
be
required
to
register
as
communist
action
organization
and
to
suffer
all
of
the
sanctions
and
liabilities
of
the
act
merely
upon
proof
that
is
--
that
it
is
promoting
the
establishment
of
such
a
dictatorship
in
this
country
by
visible,
lawful
and
constitutional
means.
the
government's
brief,
at
least,
when
it
discusses
the
application
of
section
3
(3)
seems
to
agree
with
us
that
the
act
does
not
require
proof
that
an
accused
organization
practices
or
incites
of
violent
or
illegal
means
in
promoting
this
ultimate
objective
(inaudible)
than
it
has.
but
efforts
to
bring
about
a
change
in
our
form
of
government
without
incitement
of
violence
or
crime
can
never
endanger
the
national
security
no
matter
how
obnoxious
the
change
may
be
thought
to
be.
accordingly,
the
first
amendment,
we
think,
bars
congress
from
curtailing
the
advocacy
or
association
of
those
who
promote
such
change
by
peaceful
(inaudible)
peace.
the
act,
therefore,
as
we
interpret
the
objectives
component
of
section
3
(3)
violates
the
structure.
on
the
other
hand,
if
our
interpretation
is
wrong
and
if
this
court
should
hold
that
the
act
does
require
proof
that
an
accused
organization
uses
or
incites
a
violent
or
other
illegal
means
in
promoting
its
objectives
in
the
order
of
the
board
would
have
to
be
set
aside
because
the
board
made
no
finding
and
there
was
no
evidence
that
this
requirement
was
met,
that
is
to
say
that
the
communist
party,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
that
uses
or
incites
through
violence
or
illegal
means
for
the
achievement
of
--
of
its
objective.
mr.
john
j.
abt
government
doesn't
--
the
government
doesn't
reach
the
question,
your
honor.
because
the
government
says
we
read
--
read
their
brief
when
they
come
to
discuss
the
application
of
the
act.
government
has
says
that
all
of
section
3
(3)
requires
it
to
show
that
the
accused
organization
has
the
objective
of
establishing
a
communist
totalitarian
dictatorship
and
that
the
means
that
it
advocates
or
employs
to
achieve
that
objective
are
--
are
not
material.
mr.
john
j.
abt
it
doesn't
say
that
in
words,
your
honor,
you
will
have
to
--
you
will
have
to
ask
the
--
the
government
what
they
mean
but
they
do
say
in
page
261
of
their
brief
that
the
objective
referred
to
and
their
objectives
referred
to
in
section
3
(3)
is
the
objective
of
establishing
a
communist
totalitarian
dictatorship
in
this
country
and
it
don't
make
any
difference
what
the
means
proposed
or
the
means
employed
for
that
purpose
are
in
terms
of
satisfying
the
definition.
mr.
john
j.
abt
statute
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
--
statute
has
a
reference
to
changes
like
constitutional
amendments,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
you'll
have
to
ask
the
government.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
can't
speak
for
them.
mr.
john
j.
abt
they
make
no
reference
to
it.
i
think
that
that's
what
--
all
i
can
say
is
that
that
seems
to
me
that's
what
they
must
mean
when
they
say
that
the
means
don't
matter
because
in
my
judgment,
it's
a
means
that
--
that
--
are
the
only
thing
that
matters
and
not
--
not
the
ultimate
objective.
the
most
that
the
board
found
in
this
case
was
that
the
petitioner
and
i
quote
from
the
board's
report,
"advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force
and
violence
if
necessary".
this
finding
on
its
face
isn't
a
finding
of
incitement
for
violence
but
of
the
advocacy
of
abstract
documents.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that
finding,
your
honor,
is
record
2633.
moreover,
the
finding
was
based
on
substantially
the
same
evidence
which
was
before
the
court
in
the
yates
case
in
which
this
court
held
could
not
support
the
finding
of
incitement.
accordingly,
on
it's
face
and
as
applied,
the
act
outlaws
petitioner
without
proof
of
any
acts
or
advocacy
which
endangered
the
national
security.
this
conclusion
is
further
fortified
by
section
13
(e)
of
the
act.
section
13
(e)
enumerates
eight
criteria
for
the
board
to
consider
in
determining
whether
an
accused
organization
is
or
is
not
a
communist-action
organization.
most
of
these
criteria
focus
on
views,
policies
and
their
expression.
none
of
them
has
anything
to
do
with
the
use
or
advocacy
of
violent
or
unlawful
means.
thus,
section
13
(e)
(2)
requires
the
board
to
consider
the
extent
to
which
the
views
and
policies
of
an
accused
organization
do
not
deviate
from
those
of
the
soviet
union.
the
views
and
policies
need
not
be
seditious,
dangerous
or
even
false.
indeed,
they
may
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
american
people.
yet,
they
provide
one
of
the
basis
for
imposing
the
destructive
liabilities
and
penalties
of
the
act
simply
because
they
are
similar
to
views
expressed
by
spokesmen
for
the
soviet
union
in
applying
this
criteria
which
the
board
--
which
the
court
below
characterized
"as
furnishing
one
of
the
chief
items
of
evidence
in
the
case".
the
board
rested
its
finding
adverse
to
the
petitioner
primarily
on
the
fact
that
it
and
the
soviet
union
advocated
such
legitimate
and
widely
held
views
as
of
the
chiang
kai-shek
regime
was
reactionary
and
corrupt,
that
the
people's
republic
of
china
should
be
seated
at
the
united
nations.
that
syngman
rhee
was
a
corrupt
dictator
and
that
prohibition
of
atomic
weapons
as
advocated
in
the
stockholm
pledge
was
in
the
interest
of
world
peace.
but
the
heresy
of
non-deviation
from
views
like
these
can
be
penalized,
then
governmental
control
of
political
expression
and
association
is
indeed
unlimited.
in
fact,
the
ex-provisions
concerning
front
and
infiltrated
the
organizations
as
well
as
section
5
of
the
communist
control
act,
already
penalized
offense
of
non-deviation
from
the
views
of
petitioner.
this,
i
think,
is
a
technique
of
mercantilism
which
the
nation
rejected.
affirmance
of
the
act
and
the
board's
order
would
resurrect
and
make
it
our
national
policy
by
freezing
it
into
the
law
and
arming
it
with
intolerable
sanctions.
the
fact
is
that
the
act
would
violate
the
first
amendment
even
if
proof
were
required
that
an
--
an
accused
organization
was
engaged
in
conduct
endangering
the
national
security.
for
the
act's
restrains
sound
expression
and
association
are
far
broader
than
necessary
to
meet
any
possible
danger
from
such
conduct.
as
president
truman
stated
in
his
veto
message,
the
act
attempts,
and
i
quote,
"to
proscribe
for
groups
such
as
the
communists
certain
activities
which
are
perfectly
proper
for
everybody
else".
for
example,
whatever
else
may
be
charged
against
the
communist
party,
it
concededly
employs
association
in
the
advocacy,
collective
activity
for
legitimate
political,
social
and
economic
objectives
which
many
americans
share.
yet,
by
outlawing
petitioner
here,
the
act
suppresses
this
legitimate
political
activity.
it
does
so
not
as
unnecessary
incident
for
the
control
of
dangerous
conduct,
on
the
contrary,
it
is
legitimate
advocacy
and
legitimate
association
for
a
collective
activity
that
the
act
was
designed
to
reach
because
there
are
already
plenty
of
criminal
statutes
which
punish
espionage,
sabotage
and
seditious
conspiracy,
seditious
advocacy
and
provide
for
the
registration
of
foreign
agents
and
the
congress
has
overlooked
any
conduct
injurious
to
the
national
security,
it
could
easily
make
it
punishable
by
legislation
narrowly
drawn
for
that
purpose.
respondent
argues
that
the
act
is
valid
because
of
strikes
at
a
grave
evil
--
evil.
the
inference
is
that
once
congress
finds
that
an
organization,
like
petitioner
is
dangerous,
all
of
its
advocacy
and
selective
activity
may
be
suppressed
including
that
which
is
lawful
and
innocent.
this
is
a
theory
of
congressional
power
which
says
that
congress
may
toss
an
atom
bomb,
an
h-bomb
in
the
general
direction
of
any
evil
that
it
finds.
but
due
process
prohibits
congress
from
what
the
military
call
over
killing
at
least
on
constitutional
rights
for
the
victims.
and
the
prohibition
is
even
more
stringent
for
the
killing
occurs
within
the
area
where
the
first
amendment
grants
asylum.
accordingly,
use
of
the
legislative
h-bomb
embodied
in
this
act
cannot
be
validated
without
writing
off
the
first
amendment
and
indeed,
due
process
along
with
it
as
a
security
risk.
i
turn
now
to
the
question
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
the
registration
order
requires
petitioners'
officers
to
perform
an
act,
the
signing
and
filing
of
petitioners'
registration
statement
which
constitutes
an
admission
of
their
membership
and
officership
in
the
communist
party.
this
court
has
held
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
it
does,
your
honor,
in
several
ways.
first,
it
requires
the

to

know,
by
what
--
but
--
but
we
are
--
have
to
the
attorney
general
regulations
which
were
issued
under
the
authority
of
the
act,
specific
authority
of
the
act
which
require
the
registration
statement
to
be
signed
by
all
of
the
officers
and
members
of
the
governing
board
of
the
organization.

mr.
john

the
--
the
--
i
may
say
also
that
the
--
the
act
requires
that
the
--
in
the
event
that
the
organization
does
not
register,
the
officers
have
an
individual
duty
to
register
the
organization.
and
then,
of
course,
if
the
officers
don't
perform
that
duty
and
list
all
the
members,
the
members
are
(inaudible)
the
court
has
held
that
an
admission
of
membership
or
officership
in
the
communist
party
may
not
be
compelled.
accordingly,
at
least
under
the
attorney
general's
regulations,
the
registration
order
could
rose
invasion
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
the

my
argument
at

moment
is
that
--
mr.

because
the

mr.
john

abt
that's
right.
mr.
john
j.
abt
--
certainly
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
certainly,
congress
could
not
have
had
in
mind
that
a
lawyer
or
some
anonymous
individual
or
someone
who
didn't
know
about
the
organization
signed
the
registration
statement
because
section
15
of
the
act
imposes
a
serial
--
severe
penalty
for
every
misstatement
contained
in
the
registration
statement
for
the
omission
of
the
name
of
any
member
of
the
organization
from
the
registration
statement
and
for
whole
series
of
other
things
which
obviously
would
make
no
sense
in
terms
of
a
--
of
a
--
an
anonymous
legislation
statement
signed
by
nobody
and
certainly
no
human
being
who
wasn't
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
organization
would
undertake
to
make
himself
liable
to
this
fantastic
criminal
penalties
for
stating
things
about
which
he
didn't
and
couldn't
know
anything.
mr.
john
j.
abt
the
other
--
the
other
thing,
it
seems
to
me
clear,
is
that
congress
itself
recognize
it
that
there
was
a
real
problem
of
self-incrimination
here
because
it's
in
--
and
it
was
in
recognition
of
that
fact
that
it
wrote
section
4
(f)
into
the
act
for

mr.
john

this
court
certainly
is
going
to
have
to
pass
on
the
question
as
to
the
validity
of
the

since
they're

the

has
already

suppose
the

saying
that

assume
that

strike
down

regulation.
but
i
think
in
--
in
considering
whether
the
regulation
is
contrary
with
the
statute
whether
the
regulation
is
valid,
the
court
will
have
to
consider
the
problem
with
self-incrimination
in
this
case.

mr.

congress
--
this
congress
is
legislating
to
get
a

signed

an
unsigned

so
that

of

perjury
and

not.
mr.

about
the
tort,
your

i
can't
ream
that

any
such
thing
defined,
congress
must
have
supposed
that
some
human
being
having
knowledge

mr.

they

they
--
mr.
john

--
congress
thought
it
had
the
wit
to
reconcile
the
two,
your
honor,
and
a
part
of
it
reconciled
the
two
in
section
4
(f),
not
--
not
your
way
by
having
an
anonymous
statement
signed
but
by
putting
into
the
statute
but
if
thought
was
a
grant
of
immunity
that
would
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
--
do
the
trick.
mr.
john
j.
abt
surely,
your
honor,
that
--
that's
what
--
what
any
--
any
court
does
when
they
construe
the
statute.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
i
heard
what
mr.
taylor
said
and
i'm
not
sure
that
i
noticed
you
but
i
am
sure
of
one
thing
and
i
am
not
nearly
familiar
with
this
case
as
i
am,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
abt
and
i
don't
know
if
i
take
your
time.
mr.
john
j.
abt
section
4
(f),
the
immunity
statute,
as
i
indicated
yesterday,
it
doesn't
save
the
registration
provisions
from
attack
on
fifth
amendment
grounds
because
of
the
immunity
it
grants
is
not
coextensive
with
the
privilege.
this
is
so
because
section
4
(f)
does
not
bar
prosecution
of
an
accused
for
a
crime
which
might
never
have
been
discovered
except
for
the
lead
provided
by
its
registration
nor
does
it
prevent
the
prosecution
from
proving
the
party
membership
of
an
accused
by
evidence
to
which
his
registration
statement
applied
the
lead.
and
therefore,
it's
not
immunity.
it's
not
coextensive
of
the
privilege
within
the
meaning
of
(inaudible)
mr.
john
j.
abt
government
concedes
that,
yes.
the
majority
of
the
court
below
held
and
the
government
argues
here
that
adjudication
of
the
privilege
is
premature
in
this
proceeding.
the
argument
is
that
the
privilege
must
be
claimed
to
be
enjoyed,
a
petitioners'
officers
may
never
claim
it
and
that
those
who
so
desire
will
have
an
opportunity
to
do
so
on
a
registration
form
to
be
supplied
by
the
attorney
general.
the
government
never
suggests,
i
may
say
that
registration
maybe
accomplished
without
having
somebody
who
knows
the
fact
signs
(inaudible).
the
government's
argument,
i
had
to
say
its
argument
that
privilege
can
be
claimed
on
the
registration
form
to
be
supplied
by
the
attorney
general.
that
argument
overlooks
the
crucial
fact
which
makes
the
situation
of
the
officers
in
this
case
unique.
the
fact
is
that
a
claim
of
the
privilege
to
the
attorney
general
is
itself
in
an
incriminating
admission
that
the
claimant
is
an
officer
of
the
petitioner.
the
procedure
which
the
government
suggests
gives
the
officers
an
illusory
choice
to
clean
making
the
incriminating
admission
by
signing
and
filing
a
registration
statement
and
making
the
same
admission
by
asserting
our
privilege
not
to
file
the
statement.
since
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
to
assert
the
privilege
is
to
surrender
it,
its
assertion
cannot
be
made
a
condition
to
adjudication
that
the
privilege
protects
the
officer.
defendant
also
contends
that
the
self-incrimination
issue
was
premature
because
a
claim
of
privilege,
if
and
when
asserted,
might
be
found
to
have
been
waived
by
some
of
the
officers.
now,
showing
in
our
brief
that
none
of
the
factors
which
the
government
suggests
might
supply
a
waiver
even
if
they
were
applicable
to
the
persons,
who
were
the
petitioners'
officers
at
the
time
of
registration
is
required,
would
in
fact
waive
the
privilege.
but
--
but
apart
from
that
and
--
and
more
important
than
that,
the
question
of
waiver
by
a
particular
individual
can
arise
only
at
the
time
when
he
asserts
the
privilege.
the
act,
however,
deprives
the
petitioners'
officers
of
any
opportunity
for
its
assertion.
hence,
the
issue
of
waiver
can
never
arise.
the
government
also
argues
that
if
the
claim
of
privilege
is
made
by
an
officer
in
honor
or
by
all
the
officers,
the
only
result
would
be
to
make
the
registration
order
unenforceable
and
not
void.
this
argument
rests
on
the
same
clause
premise
as
all
the
others.
since
the
act
in
the
registration
order
necessarily
conflict
with
the
privilege
by
making
the
assertion
of
the
privilege
itself
incriminating,
the
act
and
the
order
are
not
only
unenforceable
on
a
particular
case
but
avoid
on
their
face.
on
our
brief
we
show
that
all
of
the
contentions
of
the
government,
which
i've
just
enumerated
here,
are
squarely
refuted
by
the
decision
of
this
court
in
boyd
versus
united
states.
i
can't
take
the
time
of
my
argument
for
the
court
to
go
into
that
case
if
i
refer
the
court
to
our
brief
on
it.
finally,
the
government
contends
on
the
authority
of
united
states
versus
white,
that
the
privilege
does
not
protect
the
petitioners'
officers
against
signing
and
filing
the
registration
statement.
the
white
case
is
inapplicable.
it
held
that
an
officer
of
an
organization
is
not
privileged
to
withhold
records
of
the
organization
on
the
claim
that
the
contents
of
the
record
might
incriminate
them.
here,
it
isn't
the
contents
of
the
records
but
the
admission
of
officership
in
the
communist
party
which
is
incriminating
and
it
is
that
admission
that
can't
be
compelled.
moreover,
the
decision
in
white
was
carefully
limited
to
the
production
of
the
records
themselves.
this
also
appears
from
the
court's
more
recent
decision
in
(inaudible)
versus
united
states.
the
registration
order,
however,
does
not
call
for
the
production
of
organization
records
but
for
the
preparation
and
filing
for
original
statements.
it
follows,
therefore,
that
the
privileges
available
to
the
officers
and
that
--that
its
assertion
in
this
proceeding
is
not
premature.
since
registration,
as
i've
shown,
would
very
materially
and
--
and
substantially
injure
the
petitioner
and
has
standing
to
challenge
thus,
the
constitutionality
of
the
requirement
of
the
officers
incriminate
themselves
by
filing
a
registration
statement.
accordingly,
as
judge
bazelon
held,
the
statute
could
be
held
invalid
as
conflicting
with
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
abt
correct.
mr.
john
j.
abt
we
argue
that
--
we
argue
the
members'
privilege
in
our
brief,
your
honor.
i
hadn't
found
it
to
argue
orally.
we
say
that
just
as
your
honor
held
in
n.a.a.c.p.
versus
alabama,
the
members
and
the
organizations
are
in
effect
identical
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
--
i
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
i
--
we
think
that
the
same
principle
is
applicable.
we
argue
that
in
our
brief.
mr.
forer
will
continue.
mr.
john
j.
abt
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
an
answer
to
a
question
from
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
stated
that
the
question
of
the
privilege
would
drop
out
of
the
case
if
the
act
could
be
construed
as
permitting
the
filing
of
an
unsigned
registration
statement.
i
was
wrong.
the
question
would
still
remain
on
the
case
because
section
7
(d)
requires
a
statement
to
list
the
names
of
all
officers
and
members
of
the
organization,
and
section
15
(b)
punishes
omissions
from
the
statement.
thus,
if
an
officer
or
a
member
of
petitioner
prepared
a
statement,
he
would
be
obliged
to
incriminate
himself
by
listing
his
name
as
such
even
if
he
didn't
sign
the
statement.
again,
that
the
state
--
statement
was
submitted
by
a
lawyer,
as
mr.
rankin
suggested,
the
lawyer
would
have
to
get
the
names
of
the
officers
and
members
from
one
of
them
and
the
latter
would
have
to
incriminate
himself
by
furnishing
his
name
to
the
lawyer
for
inclusion
in
the
statement.
hence,
there
is
no
escape
in
this
case
from
a
question
of
the
privileges.
mr.
john
j.
abt
someone
would
have
to
give
him
the
books
and
in
doing
so,
identify
himself
as
an
officer
or
a
member
of
the
organization
who
had
possession
of
the
books
and
that
in
itself
would
be
the
findings.
mr.
john
j.
abt
we
do
--
we
will
examine
our
brief
on
the
question
of
wide
services
in
the
discussion
length
during
mr.
rankin's
argument,
i
think
you'll
find
that
--
and
distinguished
by
them
--
let's.
i'd
like
--
i
only
have
a
--
what?
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
have
only
one
moment,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
i'd
like
to
come
to
the
second
point.
mr.
rankin
urges
that
the
court
should
not
pass
upon
the
sanctions
now
but
should
await
criminal
prosecution
for
their
violation.
but
once
the
order
is
affirmed,
the
sanctions
have
immediate
and
devastating
consequences
from
the
organization
by
writing
that
the
way
its
members
through
making
them
ineligible
for
jobs,
passports,
making
them
subject
denaturalization
of
what
not,
and
drives
away
its
contributors
and
supporters
and
that
it
even
drives
away
its
potential
audience.
thus,
if
the
sanctioned
--
as
that
aren't
passed
upon
now,
the
patient
will
die
before
the
doctor
arrives.
the
organization
will
be
destroyed
before
the
validity
of
the
sanctions
would
have
passed
upon
and
in
this
aspect
this
case
is
entirely
different
from
bond
and
share.
the
heart
of
the
public
utility
holding
company
act
was
the
so-called
death
sentence
of
section
11.
of
that
which
required,
under
certain
circumstances,
public
utility
companies,
when
ordered
to
do
so
by
the
sec
to
dispose
off
their
operating
companies.
but
that
this
sentence
never
came
into
operation
without
an
administrative
hearing
before
the
section,
with
all
kinds
of
opportunity
for
judicial
review.
and
when
mr.
justice
frankfurter
used
the
court
in
your
time
have
finally
got
around
to
testing
on
the
validity
of
a
sentence.
you
were
reviewing
an
administrative
determination
made
after
an
administrative
hearing
and
the
judicial
review
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
j.
abt
here
--
i
could
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes,
but
they're
quite
different,
your
honor.
here,
the
sanctions
of
the
act
automatically
go
to
effect
as
a
result
of
the
registration
order.
in
electric
bond
and
share,
the
registration
order
was
a
first
step
and
the
court
--
mr.
justice
hughes
discussed
the
so-called
incidence
of
registration.
what
he
didn't
discuss
and
what
he
said
were
reserved
for
later,
was
a
death
sentence
which
didn't
go
into
effect
as
a
result
of
registration,
didn't
go
into
effect
until
there
was
a
full
hearing
before
the
section
--
an
order
by
the
sec
and
judicial
review.
that's
the
difference.
