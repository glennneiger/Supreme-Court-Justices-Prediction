justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
recall,
mr.
abt,
of
the
order
described
the
manner
of
registration?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
abt,
what
significance
can
you
give
to
7
(h)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
case
of
a
failure
on
the
part
of
many
organizations
to
rise.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
it
becomes
the
duty
of
the
officer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
--
does
that
import
with
compliance
not
withstanding
7
(h)
would
be
have
if
merely
--
in
the
name
of
the
organization?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
does
it
mean
then,
what
7
(h)
mean?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
not
what
it
says
it's
--
this
--
that
bites
on
only
in
the
case
of
failure
on
the
part
of
any
organization
to
register
the
file.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
means
you
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
to
start
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
could
(inaudible)
and
i'm
so
confused
about
self-incrimination.
let's
assume
the
secretary
of
american
communist
with
this
petition,
in
fact
signed
an
isa-1,
with
more
or
less,
they're
all
answering
the
questions
or
not,
just
signed
it
as
secretary
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states,
as
i
understanding
you
to
say,
getting
back
in
the
state
of
this
argument
and
their
secretary,
the
activity
factor
of
a
(inaudible)
members
of
provision
to
the
smith
act,
would
be
satisfied
merely
from
the
fact
that
he
was
secretary
of
the
party.
and
may
he
be
prosecuted
under
the
membership
clause
if
the
government,
with
other
evidence
satisfied
the
other
elements
as
i
understood
mr.
davis,
elements
of
knowledge
and
intent
satisfying
the
activity
factor
merely
by
showing
that
the
he
had
signed
isa-1
as
the
secretary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
--
now,
he's
admitted
it
and
he
can't
use
the
fact
that
he
signed
it,
but
may
he
use
it
as
a
lead
to
discover
other
evidence
--
other
signatures
for
example,
on
other
documents
that
who
signed
the
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
was
great,
it
--
it
might
give
you
a
lead.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
it
does
give
you
a
lead,
could
you
use
what
you
got
even
if
it
was
a
lead
and
as
far
as
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
think
constitutionally?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
take
this
chance
if
you
don't
mind.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
that's
your
position
(inaudible)
on
perjury,
but
when
you
subpoena
(inaudible)
someone
or
requiring
someone
to
sign
this
registration
form,
your
identity
as
an
officer
of
the
communist
party
(inaudible)
it
is
all
your
doing
to
require
and
to
produce
perfect
books
and
records,
then
even
as
to
the
nexus
aspect,
(inaudible)
furnishing
the
lead
you
say
that
under
white,
you
still
can
force
him
to
produce
the
corporate
records,
even
though
the
(inaudible)
of
it
is
that
he
personally
identified
himself
as
a
member
of
the
organization
is
that
â€“
is
that
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
my
question
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
question
--
my
question
is
assume
he
filled
out
isa-1
and
signed
himself
as
secretary
of
the
communist
party,
but
i
don't
see
that
question
leads
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
solicitor
i'm
sorry
we
can't
get
the
witness
on
this
way,
but
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
this.
as
i
understood
mr.
davis'
argument,
the
fact
that
he
was
secretary
would
satisfy
that
element
of
the
smith
act
offense,
which
involves
under
the
government's
theory,
the
necessity
of
the
two
active
members,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
the
mere
fact
that
he
signed
this
paper,
as
i
understand
it,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
contents
of
the
records,
he
can
answer
all
of
the
questions,
but
the
mere
fact
he
signs
as
secretary,
supplies
then
doesn't
it,
if
it's
usable,
an
ingredient
in
the
smith
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
now
i
want
--
now,
i
want
to
go
beyond
that
to
the
question
i
asked
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
a
lead.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
unless
that's
so
to
the
extent
that
7
(a)
compelled
signature
of
an
officer
unless
what
you
now
conceded
as
true,
7
(a)
would
be
unconstitutional,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
didn't
understand
you
to
take
that
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
about
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
want
to
be
clear.
as
i
understand
you
there
is
the
first
amendment
problem
here
in
any
event,
this
is
along
the
naacp
v.
alabama
(inaudible)
and
then
there's
the
judicial
review,
the
issue
that
matter
whether
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
properly
found
that
the
established
case
beyond
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
preponderance
of
the
evidence
but
that's
definitely
sufficient
to
the
evidence.
no
one
else
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
adjudicate
all
those
questions
now
(inaudible)
i
can't
understand
why
they
aren't
purely
advisory
opinions,
if
ultimately,
this
case
comes
back
as
you're
having
gone
through
further
procedures
and
somebody
refused
to
sign
the
registration
statement
and
then
we
knock
out
the
statute,
knock
out
the
registration
and
this
registration
clause,
everything
else
falls
because
the
fifth
amendment
claim
is
here
and
it
can't
be
to
the
(inaudible)
why
you're
not
asking
us
to
judge
on
that
premise
an
academic
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
wasn't
that
something
--
it
was
that
something
like
that
(inaudible)
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
said,
we
got
to
take
to
take
this
as
a
package
dispose
of
all
these
things,
was
it?
and
once
they
didn't
make
a
lot
of
sense
in
perjury
matters.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
you
don't
think
so,
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
there
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
maybe
that's
the
nature
of
these
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
this
--
what
are
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
includes
the
mail,
so
i
suppose
the
labeling.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
in
this
contend,
on
--
on
your
approach,
the
fifth
amendment
claim
can't
be
asserted
by
the
organization,
either
for
officers
or
members
of
this
kind.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
anything
else?
or
--
nor
any
--
any
of
the
individual
sanctions
applicable
either
as
officers
or
as
members.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
due
process
argument
(inaudible)
