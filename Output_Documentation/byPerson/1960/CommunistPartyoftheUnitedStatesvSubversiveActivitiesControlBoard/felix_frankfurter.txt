justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
statute
itself
allows
changes
by
a
constitutional
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
statute
says
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
(inaudible)
the
government
read
that
would
acknowledge
the
statue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
just
wonder
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
that
--
why
they
had
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
inadequacy
would
you
find
that
the
statute
would
there
be
a
registration
specifically
to
sign
communist
party
of
--
in
the
united
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
would
be
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
about
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
follow
that
because
the
statute
is
valid,
the
regulation
is
was
invalid.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
--
i
suppose
the
board,
if
that's
what
you
call,
made
an
order,
specific
order,
is
the
order
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
at
the
tip
of
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it's
based
(inaudible)
communist
party
to
satisfy
the
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
what
i'm
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
repeat
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
piece
of
paper
was
sent
in
to
aid
in
whatever
registration
involved,
it
was
signed
communist
party
of
america,
does
that
satisfy
the
order
of
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
have
the
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
have
the
order
and
find
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
let's
have
the
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
here
we
are,
is
--
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
this
order
turns
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
to
be
obeyed
or
not,
is
it
not
the
question
before
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
not
the
question
because
that's
the
only
direction
that
has
been
made
against
the
communist
party.
that's
the
only
judicial
judgment
that
is
before,
isn't
it,
for
review
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
whole
litigation
(inaudible)
to
communist
party
of
united
states
of
america
and
the
subversive
activities
control
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
what
confronts
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
our
problem
is
whether
the
judgment
below
would
be
affirmed
or
reversed
or
sent
back.
so
therefore,
i'm
dealing
with
the
judgment.
now,
this
is
a
judgment
in
a
litigation
between
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
and
it
subversive
activities,
was
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
was
entered
against
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
of
america.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
before
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you're
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you're
assuming
that
the
order
of
the
court,
the
judgment
will
not
be
available.
my
question
at
the
moment
is
whether
the
order
was
in
--
before
to
find
to
obey
the
judgment.
and
i'm
not
now
confronted.
i
do
not
--
now,
i
have
to
decide
whether
in
case
you
disobeyed
the
order
of
the
court,
what
then
would
happen,
suppose
some
other
situations
arise,
other
parties
are
involved,
other
orders
will
be
issued,
other
demands
are
made
by
the
statute.
that's
not,
at
the
moment,
so
far
as
the
judgment
under
the
jury
is
concerned,
before
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
true
if
you
obeyed
the
judgment
of
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
you
said
that
it's
--
thought
it
would
be
alright
to
obey
this
judgement
put
in
--
put
in
a
piece
of
paper
signed
by
the
litigant
in
this
case,
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
america.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
no
regulations
had
been
issued
by
the
attorney
general.
justice
felix
frankfurter
lots
of
statutes
authorize
officials
to
issue
regulations
and
if
they
don't
issue
them,
the
statute
doesn't
fall.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
are
confronted
with
the
problem
of
deciding
whether
statute
is
constitutional.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
don't
have
to
take
everything
that's
either
is
in
--
is
in
the
statute
or
in
regulations
or
in
(inaudible)
by
speculating
in
order
to
invalidate
a
statute,
we
asked
just
the
opposite.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
we
have
before
us
the
statute
and
we
have
before
us
the
regulations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there's
no
command
that
we
should
also
validate
the
regulations
because
they
validate
the
statute
as
the
man
of
the
officer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
maybe
a
very
good
reason
for
an
individual
not
bringing
himself
into
that
danger
though.
that's
not
a
very
good
reason
for
not
construing
a
statute,
so
as
to
permit
its
validity
if
it
can
be
made
valid.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
problem
arises
constantly
in
the
case
of
corporations
who
are
summoned
to
produce
books
or
papers
that
arises
with
reference
to
labor
unions
as
we
now
know
everything
(inaudible)
that
problem
constantly
arises.
that
doesn't
immunize
the
legal
personality
from
obeying,
if
obedience
can
lead
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
they
get
a
part
from
the
statute,
there's
an
authorization
of
the
statute
to
issue
them
whether
they
are
valid
is
another
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
maybe
a
very
good
reason
for
throwing
out
the
regulation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
you
suggested
that
that
would
confront
the
court
with
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
self-incrimination
privilege.
and
i
say,
i'm
confronting
it,
you
might
have
to
invalidate
the
regulation
and
so
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
difficulties
are
answered
by
age
to
which
justice
clark
has
just
called
you
or
justice
brennan
has
called
your
attention.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
a
corporation
or
legal
personality
(inaudible)
anonymity.
it's
an
abstraction
maybe
but
not
an
anonymity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
the
preoccupation
of
congress
is
to
get
equal
for
perjury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
is
that
legislation
in
this
court
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
to
assume
that
people
are
going
to
commit
perjury.
that's
a
good
postulate
for
which
we
will
begin
to
read,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
also
urged
rightly
that
congress'
concern
to
protect
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination?
so
they
wanted
to
do
two
things.
they
wanted
to
get
information
and
they
did
not
want
to
make
any
(inaudible)
on
the
fifth
amendment.
and
therefore,
you
have
to
reconcile
the
two.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
beyond
the
witted
man
to
reconcile
the
suit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
didn't
(inaudible)
what
you've
said
about
congress.
i'm
entitled
to
use
my
own
way
to
do
the
--
this
legislation,
am
i
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
doesn't
bind
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
must
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
mr.
forer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
assume
now,
assume
that
i'm
assuming,
assume
that
there's
constitutional
power
by
congress
to
compel
registration
as
foreign
government
controls
enterprise
congregated
together
or
collected
together
in
the
from
of
a
party.
assume
there
is
constitutional,
i'm
not
talking
about
this
statute,
i'm
not
saying
what
i
think
of
this
statute
or
anything
like
that,
but
assume
that,
for
purposes
of
my
question,
if
there
is
constitutional
power
to
compel
such
disclosure
as
such
a
foreign
government
controlled
organization,
what
is
the
difficulty
--
what
is
the
limitation
upon
constitutional
power
to
exercise
that
power
although
the
consequences
are
that
individuals
who
belongs
to
it
with
full
knowledge
of
what
it
is,
full
knowledge
of
its
purposes
and
they're
on
adherence
with
purposes,
suffering
needs
social
consequences.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
take
your
own
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
once
--
once
there
is
a
public
declaration
by
the
attorney
general
announcing
the
state
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he
can
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he
cannot
not
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
it
--
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
i
thought
the
attorney
general
has
to
make
a
pronouncement.
i
thought
the
--
the
atmosphere
of
united
states
is,
as
it
was
saturated
in
the
notice
of
this
one.
why
do
make
the
contrary
assumption?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wouldn't
have
to
think
so
at
all
in
order
to
observe.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
to
think
that
congress
had
the
constitutional
power
to
bring
about
that
result.
that's
all
it
could
have,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
do
you
think
this
is
wieman
against
updegraff?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wonder
why
we
have
in
court
the
--
the
supposedly
the
ultimate
"determina"
whether
there
is
already
enough
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
mean
you
can't
go
out
with
--
you
can't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
can't
go
to
the
--
a
saloon
and
--
and
tell
the
appropriate
thing
that
a
servant
should
do
but
the
motion
--
was
anybody
concede
an
extra
judgment
as
the
report
has
adjudicated
that
there
are
facts
and
then
say,
"well,
i
know
better,"
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
don't
make
him
lose
his
job,
you
make
him
lose
his
job
in
such
as
a
social
consequence
because
congress
has
exercise
the
constitutional
power,
that's
my
assumption,
of
outlawing
an
organization
has
given
notice
and
it
said,
"anybody
who
belong
to
this
organization
and
thereby
ask
to
add
strength
must
take
a
social
consequence."
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
all
the
other
consequences.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
white
case
wasn't
anything
new.
that
was
held
way
back
in
(inaudible)
more
than
one
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
has
to
go
on
the
witness
stand
and
produce
those
books.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
his
feelings
are
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
a
difference
between
an
irresponsible
statement
and
the
statement
in
an
appropriate
name.
it
always
burden
(inaudible)
has
an
--
has
a
corporate
entity,
has
a
legal
personality.
everything
can
consist
of
the
individual
and
suppose
--
i
suppose
thousands
and
thousands
of
documents
are
signed
everyday
just
by
a
corporate
name
without
more,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
nothing
in,
that
isn't
anonymous
as
just
having
(inaudible)
everyday
maybe,
the
corporate
entity,
now
there's
a
personality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
getting
that
anybody
who
personally
claims
under
the
fifth
amendment
on
your
argument
and
that's
getting
that
plain
personal
claim,
it
all
claimed
under
the
fifth
amendment
(inaudible).
you're
not
suggesting
that
anybody's
personal
claims
under
the
fifth
amendment
is
foreclosed
by
any
(inaudible)
be
happy
to
make
that
claim?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
–
the
case
dealt
with
it,
the
case
turned
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
the
court
subsequently,
if
he
was
--
do
you
claim
that
other
fifth
amendments
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
--
i
don't
mean
in
this
--
i
don't
mean
the
electric
bond
and
share
but
later
to
just
(inaudible)
it's
under
(inaudible)
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
the
--
those
--
those
were
not
privilege
questions.
they
were
--
being
asked
by
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
plaintiff
established
what?
what
the
issues
were
in
the
electric
bond
and
share
or
whether
they
weren't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
it
came
out
to
affect,
i
don't
know
the
cause
and
perhaps
the
validity
of
the
death
sentence
which
was
refused
to
be
passed
on
in
electric
bond
and
share,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
unlike
the
--
i
wish
you
could
tell
me
what
the
metaphor
of
outlawing,
what
did
any
bearings
that
the
communist
control
act
of
1954,
in
his
statement,
therefore,
the
communist
party
should
be
outlawed
there
if
anything
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
does
that
--
what
is
--
what's
the
function?
what
purpose
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
instead
the
(inaudible)
is
learning
the
fact.
that's
just
the
--
an
exaltation
or
a
belief,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
(inaudible),
i
think
you
and
the
chief
justice
understate
there
are
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
determining
whether
the
fifth
amendment
was
or
wasn't
involved
in
the
electric
bond
and
share.
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment
was
not
involved.
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
was
involved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
--
it
can't
be
subject
if
fifth
amendment
was
not
involved
because
it
wasn't
involved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
regard
to
the
issue
that
came
before
it
on
the
merits
and
you
have
the
statute
label,
so
the
fifth
amendment
was
as
much
involved
there,
in
here
or
different
portions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
i
ask
you
--
inappropriate
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
see
(inaudible)
as
to
these
questions
on
the
assumption
that
you
will
permit
them
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
public
utility
holding
company
has.
do
you
mean
by
that,
the
report
doesn't
--
submitting
(inaudible)
congress
in
the
long,
long
debates
in
those
(inaudible)
and
i
would
like
to
ask
you
whether
you
think,
and
on
reading
those
debates
and
those
reports,
you
are
prepared
to
say
that
congress
would've
been
satisfied
that
all
congress
wanted
to
that
elaborate
process
with
which
one
is
familiar
in
that
particular
legislation
and
that
all
that
congress
wanted
is
to
establish
instant
right,
a
letter
saying
i
am
the
boss
of
this
holding
company.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
next
question
i
want
to
ask
you,
whether
you
think
that
with
reference
to
the
death
sentence
statute
to
the
very
main
important
which
was
involved
in
the
death
sentence
statutes,
whether
you
think
there
were
no
radiation
with
reference
to
that
act
flowing
from
the
fact
of
registration,
whether
the
--
the
opportunity
to
the
--
in
the
national
market,
whether
the
relationship
between
either
corporate
bodies
of
the
great
insul
empire,
etcetera,
etcetera.
whether
no
radiations
in
that
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
practically,
what
would
have
happened?
the
fact
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
anything
have
happened
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
administering
into
will
be
that.
would
he
--
nothing
would
have
happened.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
market
is
financing
one
of
those
and
i'm
just
--
just
saying
that
(inaudible)
will
be
call
on
just
the
same.
the
evaluation
of
it
is
changed,
would've
been
just
the
same?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
i
meant
to
ask
you
just
for
clarification
in
view
of
your
answer
to
justice
harlan's
question,
namely,
whether
isn't
it
a
fact
that
the
question
on
this
separability
gets
down
to
whether
the
court
decides
the
matter
now
or
later.
and
use,
if
i
may
take
them,
if
i
correct
it
said,
yes,
it
does
get
down
with
the
act.
and
i
don't
want
to
stop
this
but
the
fact
that
it
may
happen
to
decide
it
later,
justify
deciding
it
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
isn't
what
was
done
when
