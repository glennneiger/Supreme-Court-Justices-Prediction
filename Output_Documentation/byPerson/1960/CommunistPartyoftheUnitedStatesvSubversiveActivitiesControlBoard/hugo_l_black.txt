what
section
is
that
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
section
are
you
referring
(inaudible)
makes
it
illegal
for
someone
to
associate
any
members?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
here
seems
to
be
that
the
government
is
without
constitutional
power
to
proscribe
any
organization
to
be
controlled
by
any
foreign
government
for
its
purposes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
your
argument
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
without
constitutional
power
to
(inaudible)
the
taxing
of
(inaudible)
in
this
country
under
the
direction
of
a
foreign
country.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
based
on
the
first
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
saying
the
court
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
first
amendment
authorizes
people
of
this
country
to
engage
in
--
now
in
this
propaganda,
their
own
argument
or
whatever
you
call
it
and
at
the
same
time
--
and
at
the
same
time
also
permits
people
here
from
engaging
the
same
kind
of
argument
even
though
they're
--
during
(inaudible)
of
foreign
nation
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
have
to
stand
on
that
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
government
agree
with
you
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
the
government
have
read
their
brief
but
do
you
mean
that
they
argued
(inaudible)
change
the
form
of
government,
they
shouldn't
be
--
the
government
does
not
(inaudible)
justice

black
where
is
that
finding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
it
here?
justice

do
you
think
that
the
statute
to

decisive
in
any
way
by
somebody
unknown
(inaudible)
the
paper,
signed
communist
party
of

it

would
that
be
a
faith
(inaudible)
to
the

statute
of
congress?
justice

black
oh,
what
--
what
safety
would
be?
would
the
government
be
satisfied
with
that?
is
there
any
possibility
that
it
could
or
should
be
satisfied
with
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
had
to
be
signed
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
somebody
would
have
to
sign
it,
i
guess,
to
decide
rather
or
something
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
do
have
to
decide
unless
(inaudible)
your
proposition
on
the
fifth

and
who
could
do
that
except
somebody
who
knows
something
about
it
under
the
rules
that
are
vested
with
reference
to
self-incrimination,
i
think
we
said.
but
there
would
be
no
danger
of
self-intimidation
by
having
somebody
who
must
have
been
write
their
name
or
somebody
connected
with
the
organization
--
justice

--
as
to

i
don't
would

if
your

is
good.

it
would
be
--
justice
hugo

black
who
could
be
possibly
(inaudible)
unless
the
government
attempted
to
find
out
who
would
have
done
it?
somebody
has
to
do
it
who
knows
something
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
it
published?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
there's
any
possibility
that
this

would
ever
hold
that
under
this
act
(inaudible)
without
power
to
describe
that
somebody
before
this
organization
knows
something
about
it's
just
a

so
that
they
will
have
something
behind
you.
can
you
imagine
that
a
regulation
of
that
would
--
justice

(inaudible)
is
without
power
to
enact
or
promulgate
such

as
that?

i
hope
you
can
answer
the

i
hope
you
will
answer

i
think
his

is
very
personal.
justice

on

there's
(inaudible)

on

but
you
say
that,
on

it
didn't
qualify,
what

i
understood
you
to
say

yes,
on
that.
justice

did
they

it

126?
justice

we
don't

there's
no

we're

this

have?
is
there
any

then
there's
no
way
they

would
violate

they
didn't

they
didn't
sign
it,
didn't
sign
it?

if
they
have
to

something
acroding

that's
what
you

you'd

it
would
incriminate

held

that
he's
reporting

his

where
he

you

than
use
in

he's
an

in
your
argument,
(inaudible)
under

that
was

how

overrule
blau.
justice

his
act
getting
to

where
the

not

(inaudible).
you
say
that
doesn't
tend

being

is
not

you
must
show

it

justice

that's
right.
justice

that

that's
enough,
isn't
it
to
claim
the

self-incrimination?
justice

he's
asked
to.
justice

somebody
has

activity
associated

i
suppose

then
maybe
that's
what
(inaudible)
justice

black
(voice

is
that
what
this
is
asking?
justice

it
goes

question

somebody
can
deal

will
be
associated
with
the
communist

wouldn't
it?
justice

you
believe
anybody
can
answer
this
for
the
communist
party
where
that
shows
that
this
maybe
alright.
well,
that
shows
if
he's
actively

can

can

he's
actively

suppose
he's
not

signed

gives
all
the
information
--
justice

black
under
one
of

under

talking

does
he

violated

justice

by
applying.
justice

it
had
tried
out
one

that
he

applied

applied
for

justice

it
doesn't

he
kept

justice

those

right

why
does

you

is
ordered

and
testify?
justice

something
that

i
am
talking

i
am
talking

how
can
you
limit
this
(inaudible)

(inaudible)
justice

that's
what
(inaudible)
where
is
the
value

the
(inaudible)
justice

made
â€“
is
that
a
reason
why
made
as
a
rule
which
is
in
naacp
versus
alabama
with
reference
to
organization's
right
to
claim
the
privileges
of

so
there's
a
sufficient
nexus
to
allow
the

here
wrapped
up
as
it
is
and
all
of
the
consequences
(inaudible)
so
that
whether
or
not,
publication

so
that
they

if
it

if
it's
binding
on

as
you
are
here,
so
that

they

they
--
that
we

you
say
it,
as
i

it,
really
that's
all
that's
here.
it's
all
we
need
this
time.
we
don't
have
(inaudible)
have
anybody
sign,
don't
have
anybody's
name
will
just
to
say
communist
party,
we
register.
you
don't
think
that's
enough
to
decide,
do
you?
justice
hugo

black
should
it
be
considered,
shouldn't
it?
justice
hugo

black
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
large
and
important
act
then
we're
(inaudible)
we
don't
want
this
thing
(inaudible)
having
to
decide
it
on
the
basis
to
avoid
conflict.
we
shouldn't
consider
that
they
had
the
time
just
as
you
asked,
if
they
confide
with
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
might
effect
the
question
of
self-incrimination
are
they
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
least
under
the
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
declined
to
pass
on
government
--
government
determination
there
and
they
register
and
there
is
registration
with
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
did
they
only
get
the
question
of
self-incrimination
accepted
by
defending
themselves
against
the
charge
of
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
good
position
administration
in
connection
with
(inaudible)
if
they
judge
people
not
merely
with
the
(inaudible)
weight
under
the
(inaudible)
they
maybe
convicted
of
crime,
in
order
to
see
whether
or
not,
that
claim
of
self-incrimination
would
be
good.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
involve
the
fifth
amendment
problem
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't
mean
setting
up
another
action
in
fact?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
required
for
them
to
deal
in
the
future
and
the
present
facts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
evidence
to
suggest
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
they
were
raising
and
may
be
i
am
wrong
about
it,
the
place
is
in
fact
different,
possibly
a
district
case.
the
argument
here
that
i
can
gather
to
each
of
the
problems
is,
what
is
decided
in
the
act
in
communist
party
in
fact,
amounts
--
well,
not
expressly
declare
it
to
a
direct
money
unequivocal
practical
outlawry
of
the
political
party,
which
at
least,
in
some
of
the
evidences
is
(inaudible)
small
political
party.
the
plaintiffs
argue
--
argued
outlawry
and
that
cannot
be
done.
only
way
i
see
it
is
to
determine
that
it
does
not
invade
the
party
and
its
outlaws
and
the
criminal
fee
of
the
party
(inaudible).
the
only
way
perhaps,
that
it
grieves
death
certificates
to
see
whether
taken
as
a
whole,
it
does
amount
with
the
three
outlawing
of
(inaudible)
when
illegal
act
relates
to
justice
stewart's
opinion
to
--
i
recall
the
mr.
justice
brandeis
--
if
he
made
a
crime
but
you
couldn't
go
all
the
way
to
the
bridge
between
them
of
speak
and
express
influence,
simply
because
some
of
the
activities
were
illegal.
i
assume
that
that
is
done.
and
assuming
that
you
can
only
find
that
out
by
looking
at
the
whole
act
and
all
of
its
statutes,
how
could
the
court
and
members
of
the
senate
merely
to
registration
as
the
other
parties.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
any
other
cases,
as
i
understood,
of
that
case
under
the
light
--
that
case
which
did
not
refer
to
freedom
of
speech,
prayer
and
proximity
as
far
as
i
recall
it
and
(inaudible).
the
mere
registration
is
met
to
providing
or
to
make
any
changes
as
for
the
--
the
other
members
to
bring
about
a
conviction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
prevent
that
case
in
disposing
of
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
argue
here
that
any
party
--
any
party
that
operates
as
a
party,
rather
than
act
like
just
the
smith
act,
as
i
understand
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
incumbent
practice
as
an
outlawing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that,
i
understand
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
it
changes
but
--
but
you
can't
change
it
by
giving
it
a
different
label,
can
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
does
--
does
it
--
does
it
or
has
it,
or
has
it
not
and
i'm
not
talking
about
in
all
of
the
claims.
has
it
or
has
it
not
as
to
provoked
sought
votes,
sought
members
on
public
questions
which
--
which
--
to
some
of
which
is
said
to
be
wholly
illegal
but
has
it
or
not,
acted
in
that
respects
and
that
element
was
there
as
a
party?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
a
political
party.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i'm
getting
at
is
this.
we've
said
that
the
reference
to
the
littering
in
the
streets
that
there
are
other
ways
to
prevent
littering
in
the
streets
that
bars
freedom
of
speech
and
press.
you
could
go
after
the
direct
act
to
consider.
does
this
--
do
these
laws
(inaudible)
make
it
legal
or
illegal
(inaudible)
is
not
a
punishment
of
what
the
congress
wanted
to
do,
tried
to
do,
to
outlaw
the
parties
which
burdens
on
it
that
make
it
impossible
to
act
in
the
party
to
any
of
the
things
that
the
party
is
doing.
do
you
believe
that
it
could
possibly
act
through
the
party,
with
these
things,
these
laws,
i
think.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
they
manage
to
check
what's
presented
to
your
members?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn't
it
be
better
to
meet
the
case
in
on
to
put
on
something
down.
congress
has
intended
to
the
communist
party,
it
imposed
sanctions
that
amount
to
outlaw
(inaudible).
it
is
not
singled
out
action
which
it
has
--
it
has
imposed,
although
it
hasn't
said
so
but
in
doing
that
it
can
place
the
burden
as
to
the
burden
which
would
seem
to
bond
from
doing
all
of
the
--
to
the
business
of
the
party,
would
have
to
be
the
function.
tactics,
no
--
no
tactics
as
that
there
is
no
(inaudible).
how
could
it
function
as
a
party?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
--
i
understand
that,
i
agree
with
that
(inaudible)
my
question
is
based
on
that
assumption.
did
it
believe
and
said
that
was
--
that
they
engaged
in
business
of
advocating
some
kind
of
reason
at
all,
whatever
it
was
to
the
old
law
of
this
government
by
the
court
upholds
toward
the
staff
and
that's
the
reason
that
congress
had
--
as
i
read
the
act
and
sought
to
make
it
impossible
to
(inaudible).
perhaps,
someone
may
have
thought,
as
was
suggested
by
distinguished
citizens
that
it
would
find
the
outlaws,
would
violate
the
constitution.
whether
it
could
be
done,
simply,
by
imposing
the
sanctions
of
the
burden
and
they
did
impossibly
and
that
is
--
is
the
form
of
sanctions.
i'm
not
criticizing
it
as
to
that
but
isn't
that
what
we
have
to
meet
here
in
this
case
and
taken
as
a
whole
that
this
act,
insofar
the
various
threats
hanging
over
to
all
these
sanctions,
but
the
operation
of
it
is
advised.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
of
--
of
course.
of
course
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
maybe
that
that
is
what
would
save
its
constitutional
analysis
that
allowed
the
foreign
(inaudible)
and
the
outlaws.
but
what
i'm
saying
is,
why
(inaudible)
--
why
not
meet
the
case
or
can
say
that
this
congress
has
had,
does
it
outlaw
the
party
because
insofar
--
far
(inaudible)
and
because
it's
perfect
eventually
that
this
(inaudible).
why
not
meet
that
constitutional
issue
which
is
plainly
in
it
to
mean
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall
it
(inaudible)
that
--
that
the
--
as
i
recall
it,
the
basic
idea
of
inseparability
is
one
of
them.
if
we
look
to
see,
we'll
have
enough
time.
and
we
have
certain
things
that
apply
to
a
part
of
the
act,
as
i
see
it,
(inaudible).
you
can't
get
to
various
parts
of
it
(inaudible),
except
there
has
to
be
one
paragraph
that
may
have
stated,
the
communist
party
requirement,
could
stand
up
to
something
(inaudible)
or
statement
where
you
register
under
this
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
they
would
--
you
thing
that
was
a
good
decision
for
the
no
name,
nor
anyone
would
take
somebody's
statements
(inaudible)
with
the
communist
party's
statement,
now,
with
registration.
if
you're
asking
(inaudible)
orders
for
that,
do
you
say
that's
one
thing
that's
a
bit
of
--
that
that
could
--
if
you
make
the
standing
alone,
is
that
what
you
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
they
get
mr.
solicitor
general
if
they
all
have
from
the
act
of
local
--
of
an
action
and
say
it's
communist
party
(inaudible)
without
any
--
any
officers
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
have
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
that
effect,
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
all
they
wanted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
it's
anybody
that
was
(inaudible),
they
have
much
confidence.
as
in
that,
provided
nothing
in
the
file
in
the
paper
by
somebody
and
signed,
maybe
by
(inaudible),
it
has
something
to
communist
party
to
statement
of
registering.
is
that
what
the
argument
you
made
just
today
(inaudible),
i
think
part
of
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
being
responsible.
you
just
suggest
it
in
a
way
that
it
would
be
a
responsible
action.
you
just
--
if
they
just
emphasized
statements,
pre
registering.
that
does
have
--
under
the
act,
you
could
include
the
statements
insofar
as
the
(inaudible)
one
of
them
is
that
and
the
other
was
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
on
your
--
on
your
argument
before
to
this
case,
i
assume
that
everything
they
say
is
standing
--
that
we
consider
nothing
else
in
the
world
except
one
provision,
it
means
no
more
than
that
pre
registering.
and
we
say
it's
best
that
the
separable
parties
and
that
makes
it
--
we
had
the
(inaudible)
and
that
would
be
the
--
we
can
(inaudible)
it
to
that
is
fairly
treatment,
an
act
of
congress
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
about
10
years,
in
separate
facts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
(inaudible)
that
we
should
consider
it
all
(inaudible)
on
the
question
of
(inaudible),
it's
under
attack.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
have
then
resolved
the
question
of
whether
or
not
that
would
confiscate
their
properties
at
a
reasonable
familiarity
than
the
--
and
i
do
not
believe
that
it
was
impossible
to
say
at
that
time
under
the
act
(inaudible)
where
they
confiscated
enough
--
it
confiscate,
once
they
found
out
how
they
did
it.
therefore,
it
was
the
government
but
i
understand
that
it
was
far
more
subject
to
the
matter
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
plenty
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
injury?
what
constitutional
injury
(inaudible)
think
can
find
it
that's
declared
to
them
of
that
by
confiscation
of
the
property
if
--
if
they
meant
to
choose,
provided
in
the
act
to
abolish
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
if
anything
else
but
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
that's
right.
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
think
of
any
way
that
their
property
would
--
would
be
taken
except
by
registration?
can
you
think
--
would
that
have
barred
them
from
using
the
(inaudible)?
would
it
have
barred
them
from
getting
acted
up?
would
it
have
destroyed
them,
though
financially
to
mere
registration?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
they
--
they
got
--
they
got
around
that
by
registering.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
would
follow
--
what
would
follow
if
they
register,
that
would
be
dangerous
to
this?
would
they
lose
the
right
if
they
registered?
to
a
--
in
fact
there
are
so
many
things,
i
can't
remember
them
all,
but
was
there
any,
as
to
their
restraint
of
possible
(inaudible),
the
kind
that
there
is
here.
they
would
suffer
from
the
mere
acts
of
registration.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
the
climate.
what
did
the
act
provides
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
we've
done
to
them
by
merely
registering?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
bar
--
would
it
bar
them
from
using
mails?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
registration.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would've
happened
to
them
--
what
was
the
injury?
is
it
--
is
it
clear
to
them
by
registering
under
that
act
by
registering
alone?
what
property
would
have
been
taken
from
them?
would
they
have
lost
the
--
the
various
lives
of
tax
deductions,
or
any
of
the
things
like
that
that
have
provided
them
this
act
by
registering?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
i
understood
you
to
say
the
separate
and
that
court
held
that
was
separate.
it
wouldn't
involve
and
they
could
attach
that
later.
by
registering,
they
did
not
injure
themselves.
according
--
under
the
constitutional
claims
there,
they
didn't
think
it
barred
them
from
all
these
things.
it's
barred
them
from
injury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
and
i
--
i'm
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
speaking
about
the
truth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
is,
what
does
the
act
provide
by
law
that
could
be
done
to
them,
the
way
they
(inaudible)
from
doing
anything
of
any
kind
or
any
nature
by
registering.
what
did
the
act
say,
will
be
a
legal
consequences
that
will
destroy
your
business
by
mere
registration.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
a
matter
of
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
a
constitutional
right
if
they
are
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
--
i'm
--
it's
not
what
i'm
--
not
what
i'm
talking
about.
i'm
talking
about
the
legal
consequences
of
the
registration.
here,
you
admit,
i
thought
they
would
be
barred
from
various
things
that
you
get
practical
(inaudible)
what
other
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
--
when
--
why
else
would
it
be
(inaudible)
registering?
they
would
not
register
alone.
justice
hugo
l.
black
acted
up
to
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that's
separation
here,
treating
this
as
the
only
thing
that
we
consider,
these
consequences
don't
come
which
are
incomparably
away
from
the
legal
--
legal
consequences
provided
by
the
act
and
those
that
were
the
form
--
that
would
have
(inaudible)
on
the
whole
sense.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that's
not
correct,
i'd
like
to
know
why.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
--
what
i'm
talking
about
here
is,
is
it
not
â€“
is
it
not
true
that
if
they
had
merely
come
up
and
say,
"sign
a
statement
or
somebody's
going
to
pay
for
it
because
we
probably
have
thought
you
appeared
here
by
race."
would
that
--
are
there
any
consequences
such
as
acts
of
the
government
and
so
forth
that
would
have
to
be
a
part
of
(inaudible)
under
the
act
which
would
practically
destroy
their
ability
to
continue
what
they're
doing
of
the
party.
that
was
not
legal
consequences
under
the
wholly
(inaudible)
of
the
act
on
registration
alone.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
see
this
claim
that,
there's
no
relevance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they're
about
to
have
certain
by
passing
the
acts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
view
all
of
the
sanctions
together,
amounting
to
the
outlawry,
whether
you
call
it
so
or
not,
if
he
had
a
question
of
outlawry.
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
if
all
of
it
amounts
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
yes,
as
i
understood.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
reason
i
asked
that
before
is,
you
answered
the
question
which
said
the
outlawry
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
all
the
claims
and
is
a
matter
of
--
you
answered
that
here
and
as
i
understand
you
to
make
your
--
make
your
claim.
but
--
the
question
would
still
remain
if
all
the
sanctions
to
that
--
and
as
well
as
all
of
them
amounts
on
outlawry
of
all
the
activities
of
a
political
party
and
whether
that
could
be
constitutionally
be
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
--
would
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
as
a
matter
of
choice
but
as
a
matter
of
usage.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
--
do
the
order
require
individual
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
you
say
about
an
individual?
justice

can
you
think
off?
