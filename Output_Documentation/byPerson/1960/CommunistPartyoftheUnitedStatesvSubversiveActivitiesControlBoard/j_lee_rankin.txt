mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
during
the
recess,
i
asked
for
--
that
the
registration
that
they
performed
to
be
secured,
i
have
enough
copies
so
we
could
tender
the
court
as
evidence
(inaudible).
in
regards
to
that
additional
matter,
i
could
--
i
could
try
to
clarify
the
problem.
we
do
not
cite
in
our
brief,
the
portion
of
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
portion
of
the
code
of
federal
regulations
showing
the
regulation
of
attorney
--
attorney
general,
promulgated
under
the
statute
but
it
is
title
28,
section
11
(1)
and
following.
i
think
the
particular
section
that
you'll
be
interested
in
is
section
11.200,
which
says
forms
for
registration
of
organizations,
each
communist-action
organization
in
each
communist
front
organization
which
had
required
to
register
with
the
attorney
general,
shall
accomplish
said
registration
on
a
form
hereby
designated
as
form
isa-1.
this
form
is
available
at
the
internal
security
division
of
the
department
of
justice
and
so
forth.
now,
that
form
is
the
one
printed,
mimeographed
on
white
of
the
forms
that
the
clerk
has
and
it
does
provide
explicitly
for
signature
of
the
officers.
the
only
reference,
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
form
is
isa-1
is
the
white,
the
pink
form
is
for
members
themselves,
as
i
recall
or
it
maybe
for
the
front
organization.
so,
the
only
reference
in
the
regulations
is
to
the
form
by
this
description.
however,
it
does
provide
for
the
officers
to
sign
it.
now
the
government
does
not
argue
in
its
brief
that
the
communist
party
could
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
statute
by
not
having
officers
sign
it,
but
i
do
think
it's
a
valid
position
and
i'll
try
to
tell
you
why
at
this
point.
the
parts
of
the
statute
are
setout
in
the
appendix
to
a
petitioners'
brief
and
on
page
148
of
the
petitioners'
appendix
to
his
brief,
not
his
brief
but
its
appendix,
he
sets
out
section
7
(c)
which
describes
what
is
expected
from
a
communist-action
organization
and
then
in
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
appendices,
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
148.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
that's
the
statute,
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
call
attention
to
and
in
that
statute,
in
section
7
(c),
subparagraph
(c),
you'll
note
that
it
describes
what
is
expected
of
the
communist-action
organization
as
to
registration.
in
one,
in
the
case
of
an
organization
which
is
a
communist-action
organization
or
a
communist
front
organization
on
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
this
title
and
within
30
days
after
such
day,
the
--
the
registration
required
by
section
(a)
or
(b)
shall
be
made,
taking
sentence
there
or
part
of
the
sentence
and
starting
with
(c).
then
it
goes
on
to
(d),
saying
the
registration
made
under
subsection
(a)
or
(b)
shall
be
accompanied
by
a
registration
statement
to
be
prepared
in
so
forth.
so
it's
clear
that
it's
contemplated
by
the
congress
that
two
things
will
be
involved,
one
of
them
is
the
registration
of
the
organization
itself.
congress
was
interested
in
the
identity
and
identification
of
the
organization
itself
and
then
it
goes
on
to
provide
in
a
separate
portion
for
the
registration
statement
which
involves
and
contemplates
substantially
more,
both
from
constitutional
considerations
and
acts
themselves
then
is
involved
in
mere
registration
itself.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think,
they
can
just
say,
we
register,
in
so
many
words
and
comply
with
the
statute.
we
–
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
can
be
filed
by
mail
or
otherwise,
a
statement
that
the
communist
party,
a
communist-action
organization
registers
and
i
think
they
would
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
first
part.
they
do
not
require
the
--
or
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
second.
and
i
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh
yes,
i
think
they
are
contemplated
under
the
--
the
registration
statement
which
is
different
from
registration
of
the
party.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that
you
have
to
take
that
into
account
in
construing
the
act
and
the
acts
of
the
attorney
general
under
the
act
and
i
think
you
could
determine
that
the
attorney
general
had
no
power
to
require
officers
to
sign
to
register
--
to
sign
any
registration
statement
if
it
involves
a
constitutional
problem
that
might
otherwise
invalidate
the
act
because
it
shows
the
intention
of
the
congress
that
that
shall
not
be
done.
now,
i
think
that
there
are
other
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
i
think
also
that
it
is
bearing
in
the
interpretation
of
the
regulations
made
by
the
attorney
general,
if
they
could
be
--
a
portion
of
them
separate
it
under
separability
that
certainly
you
could
say,
"well,
the
registered
is
sure
of
signing
the
names
of
the
officers
if
that's
properly
and
physically
possible.
now
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
it
performs
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
--
mr.
justice,
it
is
set
forth
what
is
expected
of
the
registration.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
i'm
saying
that
i
think
that
you
could
construe
the
act
to
not
reach
the
constitutional
question
or
to
decide
that
the
regulation
was
beyond
the
attorney
general's
power
in
applying
the
act
insofar
as
he
required
the
officers
because
the
--
act
does
not
anyplace,
say
that
this
has
to
be
done
by
officers.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
would
require
you
only
to
readout
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
regulation
is
beyond
the
attorney
general's
power.
if
the
only
way
that
the
--
the
fling
could
be
accomplished,
was
in
violation
of
the
constitution
and
his
regulation
required
that,
then
i
think
that
the
interpreting
of
the
act,
you
would
stop
surely.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
when
he
--
certainly
couldn't
require
just
anything
as
far
as
the
form
is
concerned.
that's
my
point.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice,
i
think
they're
just
--
a
footnote
at
the
bottom
here
that
describes
how
it's
to
be
signed.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
number
6,
paragraph
6
on
the
front
page.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
goes
on
to
the
question
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
this
--
no,
this
is
the
only
form.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
they
would
have
to
file
something,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
would
have
to
go
as
far
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
they
could
say
--
they
have
to
invoke
their
privilege
and
they
could
say,
"if
we
reveal
our
officers,
it
would
incriminate
the
officers
and
therefore
we
will
go
as
far
as
we
can."
i
think,
that's
what
the
holding
of
this
court
show
and
invoke
it
as
to
the
part
that
they
couldn't
do.
now,
they
could
say
we
are
communist
organization,
we
have
certain
things
that
we
can
reveal
and
without
affecting
any
problem
of
incrimination
and
then
say
we
can't
fill
out
this
or
that
because
it
would
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
that
on
the
construction
of
the
white
case
of
this
--
of
this
court
--
the
decision
on
that
case,
that
this
court
made
it
very
plain,
that
the
officer
as
such,
did
not
have
the
privilege
that
if
he
said,
i
am
an
officer
of
so
and
so
labor
organization
and
therefore,
i
don't
want
to
bring
the
books
and
records
into
court
that
there
was
no
privilege
for
him
as
an
officer.
he
had
a
privilege
only
as
an
individual
and
that
is
of
great
importance
to
law
enforcement
in
this
country.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh
no,
but
--
let
us
look
at
that
with
the
white
case.
there
were
papers
and
records
of
a
labor
organization
and
you
couldn't
possibly
get
him
--
get
them
into
court
without
having
the
identity
of
the
officer
revealed
as
a
part
of
that
transaction
and
he
complained
about
it.
he
says
--
he
said
they
--
that
may
incriminate
him.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
he
claims
that
it
might
tend
to
incriminate
him
or
direct
to
produce
the
records.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right
and
the
court
said
that
the
fact
that
he
is
an
officer,
as
an
official,
he
has
no
privilege
whatsoever.
now,
as
an
individual,
he
did.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
want
to
deal
with
that
separately
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
that's
a
different
problem
but
i
--
i
do
want
to
insist
that
the
--
what
the
white
case
held
was
not
as
counsel
presented
it
and
it's
most
important
to
law
enforcement
in
this
country
because
it
doesn't
only
mean
in
this
case,
but
it
means
wherever
you
have
anyone
who's
asked
to
produce
the
--
the
books
and
records
of
a
corporation
or
any
association
in
this
country
who
says,
why,
if
you
find
out
i'm
an
officer,
it
will
lead
to
a
--
a
chain
that
will
convict
me
of
a
crime
and
i
won't
produce
it
and
that
would
close
up
vast
areas
of
proof
that
this
court
has
permitted
and
approved
ever
since
the
white
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right
mr.
justice,
but
i
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
could
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
mr.
justice,
i
think
it's
the
--
that's
merely
per
se.
i
don't
think
it
reaches
beyond
that
at
that
point.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
i
think
it
would
be
more
substantial
as
far
as
activity
is
concerned,
but
as
i
heard
mr.
davis
and
(inaudible),
maybe
i
misinterpret
him,
his
words
to
the
court,
it
seemed
to
me,
he
was
distinguishing
between
the
intent
and
the
membership
and
the
activity
when
you
said
that
he
thought
paying
dues
would
be
activity
and
he
was
trying
to
answer
the
question
whether
that
was
activity
as
a
part
of
membership
and
he
didn't
think
and
told
you
that
that
was
not
enough,
merely,
activity
and
membership
was
not
enough.
in
fact,
i
think
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question,
he
indicated
that
that
would
in
some
cases,
be
it
merely,
per
se.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
the
position
of
the
government
in
the
membership
cases.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
blau
was
going
into
the
question
of
what
the
records
contained.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
i
think
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
this
problem
here
with
the
act
as
an
officer
as
distinguished
from
his
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i'd
--
i'd
--
mr.
justice,
i
don't
think
the
blau
case
held
that
that
was
enough
for
the
membership
clause,
but
i
do
--
do
think
it
held
that
it
would
--
might
furnish
evidence
that
would
be
in
the
chain
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
that
-
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
but
he's
not
acting.
in
this
capacity,
he
signs
as
an
officer,
as
an
individual
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
he
can
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
he
can
withdraw
from
being
an
officer
and
not
have
any
responsibility
just
like
the
man
in
the
white
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
i
think
that's
a
separate
problem,
but
i
--
i'm
trying
to
say
and
i
think
this
court
has
held
very
clearly,
a
number
of
cases
including
the
last
time
that
i
recall
white
as
an
officer,
has
no
privilege
in
regard
to
the
books
and
regards
of
the
association
or
corporation
when
he's
asked
to
produce
it.
now
this
goes,
this
case
has
not
applied.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
think
this
case
goes
beyond
that
and
i
don't
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
this
has
asked
him
to
not
just
bring
the
records,
books
and
records
in,
but
to
bring
forth
a
statement
that
he
incorporates
things
that
are
on
those
books
and
records.
so
it
goes
beyond
the
white
case
in
that
regard.
now,
i
don't
--
i
think
this
case
is
premature
in
regard
to
that
problem,
because
he
--
you
don't
have
a
case
where
he
has
the
problem
of
registering
and
he
says,
i
can't
do
it
because
it
will
incriminate
me.
you
don't
have
that
before
you
and
he
just
says,
i
can
set
answer
to
this
and
this,
which
is
exactly
what
the
books
and
records
show,
but
we
don't
have
a
detailed
membership
for
this
and
so
i'd
have
to
make
that
up
and
i
don't
have
to
furnish
that
so
i
include
the
fifth
amendment
on
that
and
you
could
take
any
number
of
things
that
some
of
them
you
might
say,
there
is
a
real
detriment
that's
involved
and
some
you
might
say,
are
not.
and
then
he
would
have
to
answer
some
and
he
wouldn't
have
to
answer
some,
but
he
can
under
the
board
case,
he
can
--
on
the
sullivan
case,
he
can
take
the
form
and
answer
what
he
can.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
he
certainly
reveals
that
he
is
an
officer
of
the
party.
he
signs
as
an
officer.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
that
doesn't
necessarily
show
he
has
any
connection
that
could
incriminate.
if
i
could
assign
it,
well,
mr.
abt
could
sign
it
as
a
lawyer
and
lawyers
do
many
things
as
agents.
and
it
wouldn't
prove
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now
that
--
that's
an
argument
mr.
justice
black
that
is
not
justified
in
this
courtroom.
the
reason
is
this
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
--
they
made
that
argument
and
i
want
to
tell
you
what's
wrong.
that
section
of
the
statute
in
section
5
of
the
1954
act,
deals
with
the
problem
of
a
prosecution,
a
criminal
prosecution
against
an
individual
for
membership
from
the
party
and
then
it
proceeds
to
say,
these
different
elements
shall
be
considered
as
to
whether
he
is
a
member
in
accordance
with
instructions
to
the
jury
in
a
jury
trial.
now
that's
entirely
different
from
the
problem
in
this
case.
it
doesn't
in
anyway,
say
that
in
this
statute
or
in
that
one
as
it
amends
this,
that
that
shall
be
used
in
regard
to
who
are
members
of
the
communist
party.
they
are
to
file
and
say
who
their
members
are
and
then
if
anyone
is
prosecuted
under
the
(inaudible)
those
are
considerations.
it
doesn't
say
that
anybody
who
happens
to
be
affiliated
is
a
member.
there
aren't
any
such
words
in
the
statute,
but
it
says
if
he's
paid
money,
if
he's
affiliated,
if
he's
attended
meetings,
those
are
things
that
should
be
considered
and
congress
was
reasonable
in
taking
those
various
things
as
considerations
for
the
jury
to
examine
and
the
jury
was
--
and
jurors
say
and
if
the
court
didn't
sort
the
case
by
directing
verdict
that
many
of
those
things
that
the
evidence
was
not
substantial
and
showing
the
real
connection,
were
not
enough
to
have
any
jury
convict
a
man
of
membership.
so
that
it
isn't
kind
--
that
is
no
definition
either
by
contemplation
or
anyway
in
your
--
can
construe
this
statute
of
what
membership
is
in
this
context.
they
ought
to
try
to
determine
what
the
membership
is
and
presumably,
congress
thought
they
ought
to
know
if
they
are
people
in
leadership
of
this
part
and
then
it
gets
to
the
question
of
the
individual
and
he
if
the
party
doesn't
register
him,
he
is
to
come
forth,
but
there
all
kinds
of
protections
for
the
individual,
too.
he
has
an
opportunity
at
anytime
to
withdraw
and
the
list
isn't
made
public,
for
a
considerable
period
of
time.
and
it
doesn't
say
whether
he
was
a
member
for
12
months
as
counsel
remarked
here,
prior
to
the
time
of
filing.
the
statute
says,
if
he
was
a
member
at
the
time
of
the
filing
and
what
he
wants
to
get
off
the
list,
congress
provided
that
he
can
come
forward
and
he
can
tell
the
attorney
general,
i'm
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
therefore,
i
ask
my
name
be
removed
and
there
can't
be
any
publication
of
his
name
until
a
later
date
after
all
that
question
was
settled
and
a
provision
for
an
appeal
to
the
board
and
he
doesn't
have
to
say,
i
was
not
a
--
a
member
at
the
time
that
they
were
ordered
to
file
or
at
the
time
they
order
became
final.
all
he
has
to
say,
he
has
a
period
of
30
days
in
which
to
do
anything
like
that.
after
notice,
is
i
deny
that
i
am
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
that's
all
he
has
to
do
and
come
forth
and
make
presentation
to
attorney
general
throughout
that
period,
his
name
is
not
to
be
published
in
anyway
and
no
lists
has
been
published
that
included
his
name
until
after
that
whole
question
is
tried
out
and
this
criteria
are
not
the
--
the
test
at
all
for
whether
he's
--
he's
a
member
of
the
communist
party
at
that
time.
so
the
congress
did
try
to
protect
the
person
who
wanted
to
get
out
and
who
was
mistakenly
put
in
or
listed
and
all
of
those
things
that
might
catch
someone
who
in,
did
not
intend
to
be
connected
with
communist-action
or
communist
party.
now
there
is
this
element
enough
that
has
been
discussed
to
here,
about
whether
or
not,
he
gets
any
independent
trial.
it's
a
position
with
the
government
that
this
is
a
--
an
administrative
proceeding
in
which
the
due
process
is
provided
for
by
the
congress
for
this
board.
there
is
complete
judicial
review
for
the
action
of
the
board
and
the
standard
is
higher
than
this
court
has
approved
for
administrative
proceedings
many
times
in
that
it
require
a
clear
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
examining
the
matter,
said
that,
that
was
a
much
more
stringent
test
and
i'm
sure
that
your
honors
will
recognize
this
it's
much
more
a
strength
of
test
and
it
conscientiously
tried
to
apply
that
test
to
the
record
in
this
case
and
to
such
an
extent
that
it
took
some
76
pages
of
an
opinion
to
examine
all
of
this
evidence
and
not
only
say
that
their
findings
were
justified
by
the
evidence,
but
going
step-by-step
to
every
finding,
as
been
claimed
here
that
some
of
these
findings
under
13
(e),
some
eight
of
them,
they
were
not
complete.
that
is
there
were
some
that
they
did
not
find
and
therefore,
since
they
didn't
find
any
under
those
three
or
four
sections
of
or
paragraphs
of
13
(e)
that
they
were
not
justified
in
finding
this
a
communist-action
organization
under
the
3
(e)
(3),
but
the
statute
is
not
developed
or
built
in
and
properly
construed
that
way.
the
test
of
whether
it's
a
communist-action
organization
is
clearly
set
forth
in
section
3
--
3
in
parenthesis,
and
which
is
defined
what
a
communist-action
organization
is.
and
then
that
congress
set
up
in
13
(e),
eight
different
items
of
evidence
to
consider
and
it
said,
you
shall
determine
in
arriving
at
whether
or
not
a
--
an
organization
satisfies
the
requirements
of
section
3
(3).
the
words
were,
the
extent
of
and
we
all
know
in
trial
of
cases,
in
juries
in
courts,
before
juries
and
otherwise,
in
courts
that
that
means
take
into
account
the
extent
whether
a
little
bit,
none
at
all
or
a
great
(inaudible)
of
each
of
these
items.
and
then
determine
from
that,
whether
or
not,
you
satisfy
the
standards
of
section
3
(3).
now
they're
construing
and
i
think,
entirely
and
properly
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
the
government
that
it
should
be
construed
that
those
were
items
to
consider
the
extent
of
it
and
if
you
found
that
they
didn't
have
any
and
under
anyone
of
them,
it
didn't
mean
that
you
couldn't
find
that
it
satisfied
the
requirements
of
section
3
(3),
but
you
were
to
--
the
board
was
to
consider
each
of
them
and
then
determine
the
extent
of
and
so
under
that
kind
of
--
which
we
think
is
the
proper
construction
and
the
court
of
appeals,
adopted
and
followed
that
very
meticulously.
it
was
a
question
of
whether
or
not,
they
--
there
were
some
evidence
or
none
evidence
--
no
evidence
that
the
board
couldn't
say,
well
will
just
disregard
that
and
not
even
consider
it.
that's
the
way
we
read
section
13
(e)
and
the
court
of
appeals
examined
it
very
carefully
and
did
likewise.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
it
has
some
serious
sanctions
mr.
justice
black,
in
that
effect.
now,
they
do
have
a
period
of
30
days
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
you
may
say,
well
i
don't
have
to
separate
so
you
have
to
get
to
that
question,
then
we
say
there
are
certain
sanctions
that
the
act
provides
and
they're
each
separable,
so
it's
the
question
under
that
--
terms
of
the
act
it's
a
question
of
whether
you
would
sustain
anyone
of
the
sanctions
against
the
individuals
or
all
of
them
or
none
of
them.
we
still
say
it's
a
disclosure
statute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
these
are
the
provisions
of
what
would
happen
to
the
individual
that
you're
just
asking
about.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
one
of
them
is
that,
he
can't
obtain
or
apply
for
a
passport.
another
one
is
the
effect
on
an
alien
deportation
that
has
been
described
here.
another
one
is
the
effect
on
his
ability
to
either
obtain
a
job
in
federal
employment
or
apply
for
one.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
act
prohibits
his
application
for
it
if
he
continues
to
be
a
member
after
the
decision,
the
final
decision
on
review,
that
this
is
a
communist-action
organization.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
he
could
get
a
trial
on
his
own
of
the
question
of
whether
he'd
violated
the
law
and
there
was
criminal
liability,
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
i
think,
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
in
administrative
tribunal
where
the
judicial
review,
called
judicial
review
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
then
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
i
--
i
think
it
would
be
open
to
him
whether
he
violated
the
order
of
the
administrative
tribunal
that
had
become
final.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
merely,
if
whether
he
had
violated
the
order.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
by
a
member,
by
applying.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
as
a
member.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
there
was
an
order
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
that
there
was
unfair
labor
practice
and
it
became
final
and
a
man
violated
the
order,
this
court
wouldn't
allow
him
to
have
a
reexamination
of
whether
or
not,
the
order
was
valid.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
as
a
contempt
proceeding
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
government
argues
that
that
is
a
not
open
to
him
in
our
brief
but
we
say
that
the
matters
now
not
before
the
court,
but
it's
premium
to
it
and
that
the
court
could
at
that
time,
determine
the
extent
of
--
of
what
he
could
do
in
trying
out
the
issues
at
that
time.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
we
think
that
the
statute
is
fundamentally
a
disclosure
statute.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
i
don't
think
it
is
proven
in
that
ways
because
that
act
expressly
provides
that
you
can't,
so
that
we
have
to
prove
independently.
i
don't
--
that
adds
nothing
unless
you
could,
by
that
discover
that
he
was
the
secretary
when
he
didn't
know
it
otherwise.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
think
the
immunity
clause
go
with
as
far
as
(inaudible).
i
don't
think
this
is
sufficient
to
include
of
privilege
and
so
it
might
give
you
a
lead
except
you
would
have
the
further
problem
but
he
doesn't
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
statute
doesn't
say
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
here
is
a
--
that's
the
easiest
case
on
the
constitution
because
the
secretary
did
sign
the
agreement
(inaudible)
for
the
party.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
you
take
a
more
difficult
case,
if
we
don't
know
whether
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
--
alright,
take
that
case
(voice
overlap)
that's
a
more
difficult
case
for
me.
i
think
that
you
couldn't
use
the
material
as
a
lead
without
infringing
upon
constitution.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
--
that
is
my
position.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
you
say
it
is
not?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'm
confused.
i
--
i
feel,
in
order
to
try
to
make
myself
clear
about
white.
i
understood
the
court
to
say
in
white
that
the
fact
that
a
person
is
an
officer
and
by
coming
forth
as
an
officer
in
presenting
books
and
records,
he
might
incriminate
himself,
revealing
it
as
an
officer
or
what
was
in
the
books
or
records,
either
one,
there
is
no
privilege
for
him
as
an
officer.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
although,
when
the
court
went
on
to
say
that,
there's
no
privilege
for
him
as
the
official.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
it
reveals
that
he
is
the
man
that's
got
them.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right
and
if
he
--
and
it's
inherent
and
as
the
court
said
there
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
--
i
think
he
would
have
to
produce
them
in
the
court
room
and
make
it
clear
that
he
was
associating
himself
as
an
official
with
those
books
and
records.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
seems
to
me
the
statute
is
clear
that
it's
not
intended
to
be
used
that
way.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
immunity
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
the
immunity
would
cover
the
lead
as
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
because
it's
intended
by
this
immunity
to
make
it
clear
that
you
cannot
use
this
registration
as
any
evidence
and
i
don't
think
you
could
use
it
as
a
lead
without
getting
into
this
proposition.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
i
think
it
is
a
serous
problem.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that's
inherent,
in
all
inherent,
in
all
such
–
invoking
of
the
fifth
amendment,
but
i
don't
think
that
has
anything
that
the
courts
recognize
can
be
protected
against
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean
justice
harlan.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
as
an
officer.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
now,
i
was
not
treating
with
the
problem
as
he
invokes
his
--
the
fifth
amendment,
which
i
--
i
don't
regard
as
a
problem
in
this
situation
at
all.
i
think
the
court
has
said
that
invoking
the
fifth
amendment
is
not
any
indication
of
guilt,
whatsoever
and
has
to
be
treated
that
way.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
--
that's
always
possible.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
say
and
i
think
that
he
is
clearly
identified
as
being
official
that
has
the
possession
of
the
books
and
records.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
of
course
as
i
say,
as
said
in
white
and
is
not,
that
he
has
no
privilege
as
an
officer
and
that
it's
his
duty
to
bring
the
books
and
records
in
and
it's
most
important
to
law
enforcement
that
he
will
be
continued
in
the
force
and
effect.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
the
certification
may
go
farther
than
the
white
case
and
i
have
tried
to
indicate
to
the
court
that
i
think
when
the
case
comes
up,
the
representative
of
the
party
might
say,
we'll
answer
so
much,
we'll
plead
the
fifth
amendment
as
to
something.
we'll
fill
out
part
of
the
registration
statement
or
we
won't
do
any
of
those
things.
we'll
bring
the
books
and
records
in
here,
lay
them
down
on
the
attorney
general's
desk
and
we've
satisfied
the
statute
and
that's
all
we'll
do.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
think
that
--
it's
properly
in.
first
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
understand
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
i
think
that's
right
mr.
justice
harlan,
on
the
other
hand,
there
was
some
inquiry
from
the
court,
here
as
to
whether
or
not,
you
--
the
government
will
accept
an
irresponsible
statement
and
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
i
don't
want
to
imply
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'm
sure
it
is
mr.
justice.
and
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
the
form
would,
the
form
requires
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
i
think
that
--
i
do
think
that
the
statute
properly
construes,
involves
several
things.
one
of
them,
important
to
register,
just
plain,
come
in
and
register
and
i
think
that
would
satisfy
that,
now
i
don't
think
it
satisfies
the
part
about
a
registration
statement
giving
detail
of
their
officers,
members
and
their
finances.
i
think
there
are
two
parts
to
it
and
congress
wanted
them
to
come
forth
and
register
in
any
form
and
then
it
also
wanted
this
detailed
information
for
good
reason.
they
wanted
to
know
who
the
officers
were
and
who
the
members
were
and
what
kind
of
financing
this
type
of
organization
has.
but
i
think
that's
clear
that
there
are
two
parts
and
i
don't
think
the
forms
contemplate
that.
i
think
the
forms
make
it
clear
that
the
regulation
of
the
attorney
general
was
to
provide
for
this
one
form,
isa-1
(inaudible)
called
and
the
form
said
in
so
many
words
that
the
officers
have
signed
it,
but
i
don't
think
the
statute
contemplated
that
is
the
only
way
to
do
it.
i
think
statute
contemplated
registration
and
the
registration
statement
and
it
says
so
and
so
many
words.
and
the
court
can
satisfy
itself
as
whether
or
not,
it
does,
well
that
is
a
proper
interpretation
of
the
statute.
but
that's
the
way
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
language
of
it
and
i
think
with
the
congress
(inaudible).
first,
they
were
in
(inaudible)
this
act
in
several
claims,
they
wanted
to
be
--
they
considered
the
question
of
trying
to
outlaw
the
party.
and
they
passed
on
to
the
question
of
disclosure.
they
decided
they
preferred
the
idea
of
trying
to
get
out
in
the
open,
who
was
at
the
back
of
the
party
and
all
the
information
they
could.
the
vice
that
congress
saw
in
this
thing
was
not
what
counsel
have
been
talking
about
here,
as
to
whether
or
not
they
could
add
or
talk
about
marxism
and
leninism
as
such,
as
an
ideology.
that
wasn't
what
congress
is
trying
to
reach
at
all.
it
was
trying
to
reach
a
foreign
control
by
the
soviet
union
party
that
was
operating
in
the
united
states
to
try
to
carryout
the
objectives
of
that
foreign
or
that
world
communist
movement
and
it
wanted
to
get
that
kind
of
a
party.
and
if
this
particular
party,
the
petitioner
here
was
not
that
kind
of
a
party,
there
wouldn't
be
any
problem.
it
wasn't
interesting,
but
if
it
was
that
kind
with
that
kind
of
foreign
domination
control
and
trying
to
further
the
objectives
of
that
kind
of
world
communist
movement
within
the
united
states,
it
want
to
reach
it.
and
it
want
to
reach
it
first,
to
get
it
out
in
the
open,
so
everybody
knew
what
it
was,
who
its
officers
were,
who
its
members
were
and
what
its
finances
were.
that's
the
first
part
and
it
was
also
interested
in
having
the
people
of
this
country,
have
the
adjudication
and
they
weren't
interested
in
adjudication
just
by
some
board
or
administrative
agency,
they
provided
for
an
appeal
with
the
preponderance
of
--
of
the
evidence
to
be
the
determination
--
determining
factor
and
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
review
that
evidence
and
then
for
a
right
to
come
to
this
court
on
certiorari.
so
they
wanted
to
be
sure
that
there
was
a
clear
opportunity
for
a
judicial
process
in
addition
to
the
administrative
process
to
make
this
determination.
once
that
had
happened,
upon
the
fair
hearing,
this
court
was
to
determine
finally
whether
there
was
a
barrier,
they
wanted
the
people
of
the
united
states
to
know
just
exactly
what
kind
of
an
organization
this
was,
not
because
anybody
would
claim
it
before
this
court
or
in
some
other
court
or
claim
it
in
the
press
or
as
individuals,
but
because
they'd
had
a
hearing
and
it
was
adjudicated
and
they
placed
great
importance
on
it.
then
they
wanted
to
get
the
information
before
the
public
and
this
court
in
regard
to
that,
has
recognized
in
quite
a
number
of
statutes
that
there
doesn't
have
to
be
any
clear
and
present
danger
for
disclosure
statutes
and
has
recognized
the
power
of
congress
to
provide
for
disclosure,
for
there's
a
proper
reason.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
because,
i
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
black,
the
government's
position
and
i
think
it's
valid,
is
that
it
is
disclosure
plus
but
it's
separable
and
if
you
think
any
part
--
part
of
the
rest
is
not
constitutional,
where
it
goes
too
far
for
the
power
of
congress,
then
you
slice
that
part
off
so
that
now,
i
think
that
properly
to
consider
the
statute,
you
have
to
take
the
disclosure
part
as
the
fair
bones
first
and
then
take
the
various
sanctions
that
go
with
it
and
say,
“well,
you
can't
do
that
or
you
can
do
it.
you
can't
do
this
or
you
can
do
it.”
and
then
when
you
get
down
to
the
members
individually,
you
can
do
these
things
or
you
can't
do
it,
but
since
it
is
separable,
it's
a
question
of
whether
disclosure
alone,
congress
was
very
careful
about
making
assessment
in
--
in
the
language
that
you
--
that
you
have
to
examine
it
section
by
section
it
seems
to
me
to
see
what
congress
was
doing
and
if
it
had
constitutional
policy
to
make
disclosure
as
a
requirement,
then
it
can
do
that
much.
and
if
you
say,
well
when
they
say
that
you
can't
get
a
passport
and
you
can't
travel
without
a
passport
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
seemed
to
me
you
have
to
take
it
piece
by
piece
in
that
manner
to
examine
the
constitutional
problem
and
then
you
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
some
of
these
things,
the
organization
is
defending
a
case
and
is
binding
its
members
by
its
defense
and
i
think
it
has
a
right
to
raise
some
of
the
questions
in
regard
to
that,
here
in
the
constitutional
problems
because
it
is
representing
those
members.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
organization
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think,
mr.
justice
black
that
some
of
the
questions
can
be,
but
you
run
into
the
problem
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
self-incrimination?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that
the
problem
that
you
have
there
is
whether
or
not
that
facts
are
before
are
before
you
so
that
according
to
the
rules
that
you
have
laid
down
over
the
years,
you
will
consider
that
question
with
such
limited
or
sketchy
facts.
we
have
to
imagine
the
various
things
that
might
be
done.
for
instance,
it
was
claimed
when
they
tried
to
get
an
injunction
against
this
proceeding
in
the
lower
courts
and
they
abandoned
that
case,
that
nobody
would
come
forth
and
testify
because
of
fear
of
self-incrimination
in
this
case,
but
several
of
the
leaders
of
the
party
did
come
forward.
they
also
signed
the
pleadings
in
this
case.
the
secretary
signed
the
pleadings
on
behalf
of
the
party
and
identified
himself.
now,
it
was
claimed
that
those
things
wouldn't
or
couldn't
be
done
and
so,
you
have
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
they're
going
to
claim
the
fifth
amendment
and
you
generally
deal
with
it
only
when
it's
invoked.
you
have
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
waiver,
but
the
all
the
information
is
so
public
and
regardless
of
a
particular
individual
that
there
is
no
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
maybe
public
as
to
some,
it
maybe
not
public
as
to
who
takes
their
place
their
tomorrow
or
changes
or
things
of
that
kind.
and
that's
the
only
reason
why
i
think
your
--
the
rules
will
always
adhere
--
are
proper
if
you
examine
that
case
when
it's
presented
with
all
the
facts.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
you've
certainly
reached
the
question
of
whether
they
should
register.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that
the
registration
can
be
done
without
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
other
questions
that
in
regard
to
the
registration
that
the
first
amendment
question
and
the
other
questions
and
--
and
the
question
is
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
you
might
not
reach
it
at
all,
what
if
they
all
came
forward
and
cite
all
the
officers,
would
you
say
that
you
had
to
decide
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
they
take
the
form
and
say
whatever
they
can
about
their
membership,
whatever
they
can
about
their
officers,
whatever
they
can
about
their
funds
or
they
do
nothing,
then
the
procedure
can
be
brought
against
them
for
not
registering
in
accordance
with
the
final
board.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
you
can't
secure
the
necessary
procedures
or
you
can't
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
that's
the
problem
in
any
case
though,
mr.
justice,
if
you
can't
(voice
overlap)
if
you
can't
find
out
who
were
the
people
in
charge
of
a
--
a
corporation's
assets
or
anything,
you
have
to
secure
that
information
in
someway
or
you
have
to
do
it
on
information
and
belief
and
try
to
prove
it
the
best
you
can.
you
always
have
that
problem.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
in
this
particular
case,
you
don't
have
to
reach
this
fifth
amendment
problem
in
regard
to
this
registration,
because
it
isn't
here.
they
could
come
in
not
inconceivable
at
all
hence
and
signing
this
very
blank,
fill
out
whatever
information
they're
willing
to
fill
out
and
sign
it
as
officers.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
--
i
still
think
you
have
the
problems
of
the
question
of
the
--
the
merger
in
the
first
amendment
and
all
of
the
questions
of
whether
the
judicial
review
is
adequate
in
your
judgment
and
you
still
have
the
problem
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
no
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
want
to
be
misunderstood
on
that.
there
is
clearly
here,
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
the
--
the
congress
had
the
power
to
provide
for
this
determination
that
this
communist-action
organization
and
require
this
disclosure
under
the
first
amendment.
they
urge
that
and
it's
here,
then
there's
also
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
the
judicial
review
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
added.
there's
also
the
evidentiary
question,
separate
and
apart
from
the
fifth
amendment
question
and
the
sanctions.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
think
the
sanctions
are
here.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
what
it
was
adequate.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
--
they
raised
the
question
of
budenz's
testimony.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
the
gitlow
testimony,
under
the
jencks'
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
though,
i'm
hoping
you
weren't
going
to
do
that.
that's
the
final
point.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we
didn't
so
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
mr.
justice,
you
have
the
problem.
what
kind
of
facts
you're
going
to
deal
with
there?
and
it's
very
real,
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
that
they
were
trying
to
explore
various,
various,
hypothetical
possible
facts
instead
of
having
concrete
trust.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
believe
so
because
certainly
if
they
--
if
they're
required
to
register,
then
it
seems
to
me
you
have
a
valid
action
that
requires
them
to
take
some
action
and
it
can
be
done
without
incriminating
them
in
any
way
or
they
can
come
forth
and
say,
we
don't
invoke
the
privilege
and
it's
said
time
after
time,
but
the
privilege
has
to
be
invoked
in
all
of
these
cases
and
you
don't
examine
that
question.
now,
i
do
think
that
there
are
some
sanctions
in
regard
to
the
argumentation
itself
that
you
want
to
examine
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
the
question
of
the
contributions
that
can
--
that
cannot
be
made
by
employees
of
the
government
and
the
fact
they
aren't
any
exemptions,
under
the
income
tax
laws
for
them
after
the
adjudication.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
these
organizations
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
adjudication.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
the
label.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
the
position
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
you
--
you
do
have
a
problem
of
--
of
these
other
sanctions
that
mr.
justice
brennan,
just
described.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
would
affect
the
organization
as
soon
as
they
are
ordered
to
register.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
you
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that's
here
but
i
--
i
don't
want
to
be
misunderstood
about
its
regulation.
i
think
that
you
have
to
consider
the
fact
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
want
to
make
a
claim
if
the
law
provides
that
they
shall
act
in
accordance
with
the
attorney
general's
regulations
and
the
attorney
general
has
made
those
regulations
so
that
i
think
you
have
to
consider
those
regulations
and
whether
or
not,
the
extent
of
the
effect
that
they
have,
in
addition
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
you
might
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
you
might
consider
whether
or
not,
taking
that
act
would
involve
that
problem.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
any
of
the
officers
would
be
incriminated.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
because
i
think
the
statute
provides
that
they
have
to
the
effect
when
they're
ordered
and
there's
a
final
adjudication.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
oh,
i
don't
understand
your
statement
and
because
i
had
summed
that
you
would
say,
in
your
whole
and
that
the
act
itself
that
in
the
orders
valid
by
the
board
and
(inaudible)
as
proved
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
therefore,
all
of
the
operating
conditions
of
the
act
come
into
play
which
means
that
they
have
to
register.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
so
because
what
i'm
try
--
trying
to
say
is
that
then,
the
question
would
be
up
to
them
like
it
is
in
cases
--
case
of
adjudication
before
to
either
file
or
not
file.
if
they
file,
we
don't
have
any
problems
about
the
fifth
amendment
because
they
haven't
raised
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
say,
i'm
very
inept
at
it
apparently,
that's
what
the
seems
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
at
this
time,
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
--
i
think
that
you
would
want
to
examine
the
questions
about
the
sanctions
that
affect
the
organization
as
distinguished
from
the
individuals
at
this
time,
in
addition
to
the,
whether
or
not,
there's
been
judicial
review
and
whether
or
not,
there's
a
first
amendment
problem
and
then,
say
that
they
have
to
register
if
you
think
that
--
that
the
statute,
is
within
the
power
to
congress
and
otherwise
the
constitution
is
valid.
and
then,
if
they
come
forward
and
say,
they've
been
filed
and
signed
the
papers,
then
they
don't
raise
the
fifth
amendment
problems
at
all
and
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
it.
if
they
do,
raise
them,
then
that
case
is
ripe.
they
may
say,
we
raised
the
fifth
amendment
about
part
of
it.
we
don't
raise
the
others,
they
may
take
to
bring
their
books
in
and
lay
them
in
the
attorney
general's
office
(inaudible)
and
there,
i
don't
think
there's
--
i
think
the
--
the
attorney
general
is
satisfied
with
that
and
requires
nothing
more.
then
there's
no
problem
that
you
ever
had
to
adjudicate.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
know
whether
it
could
be
brought
up
by
a
territory
judgment
proceeding
or
not,
but
i
know
that
it
could
be
brought
up
in
the
prosecution
and
there,
you
would
have
to
determine
whether
or
not,
they
had
commit
the
crime
or
whether
they
complied
with
all
that
the
law
required
and
i'd
think,
it
would
be
ripe
for
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
court
has
many
times
(inaudible)
that's
what
required,
they
wouldn't
examine
questions
that
was
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
returning
to
my
argument,
i
tried
to
give
some
further
consideration
to
this
problem
of
separability
and
see
if
i
couldn't
draw
upon
the
decisions
of
the
court
to
find
a
case
that
might
elucidate,
illuminate
the
questions
better
than
i
have
been
doing.
and
i
thought
that
it
would
be
helpful
to
the
court
if
i
would
call
its
particular
attention
to
the
case
of
electric
bond
company
versus
the
commissioner,
in
303
u.s.
419.
you
probably
immediately
recall
that
that's
the
public
utility
holding
company
act
and
it
provided
for
a
number
of
things
in
the
act
and
one
of
them
was
of
course
registration
and
another
was
that
they
file
a
registration
statement
and
then
there
were
a
long
list
of
other
provisions
that
were
also
included
in
the
act.
and
a
very
bitter
controversy
occurred
before
this
court,
which
the
petitioners
in
that
case,
claim
that
the
act
was
inseparable
and
that
you
had
to
construe
all
of
the
various
provisions
together.
i
make
my
position
clear
in
this
case
on
behalf
of
the
government,
in
telling
the
court
yesterday
that
the
communist
party
alone
could
register.
i
did
not
mean
to
indicate
that
i
was
giving
up,
on
behalf
of
the
government,
any
of
the
other
provisions.
i
was
trying
to
make
it
clear
that
i
thought
the
court
had
the
duty,
under
the
law
and
under
its
decisions,
to
take
each
part
of
the
statute
step
by
step
and
examine
each
part
since
there
was
a
separability
provision
and
determine
the
validity
of
each
provision
as
it
became
ripe
because
of
its
properly
coming
before
this
court
under
its
decisions
for
determination
as
to
each
of
the
various
portions.
and
i
did
not
mean
to
indicate,
if
anyone
misunderstood
me,
that
the
communist
party
should
not
be
required
to
register
on
a
statement
as
the
next
step
after
registering
as
a
party.
and
that
then
various
other
provisions
of
the
act
would
still
be
applicable
unless
this
court
determined
that
they
were
unconstitutional
or
invalid
in
a
proper
case.
in
such
event,
and
each
one
that
the
court
would
strike
down,
would
disappear
from
the
act
but
the
rest
of
it
would
be
enforceable.
i
also
tried
to
indicate
that
i
thought
that
this
court
only
has
before
it,
limited
issues
at
this
time
because
the
other
issues
were
premature
and
not
ripe.
now,
in
the
electric
bond
and
share
case,
we
have
a
case
that
is
exactly
parallel
on
this
element
of
separability.
i'm
not
saying
for
a
moment
that
it
involved
a
first
amendment
problem.
in
this
case,
it
does
not
but
it
does
involve
the
--
the
problem
of
whether
or
not,
an
act
has
numer
--
numerous
provisions
and
whether
those
provisions
should
be
treated
separately
when
the
congress
says
so
in
how
this
court
should
act
in
such
a
matter
and
treatment.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
it
could've
been
in
this
regard.
it
--
the
registration
statement,
of
course,
required
all
the
kinds
of
information
as
i'm
sure
you
are
familiar
with
and
a
part
of
that,
for
example
on
the
insul
holdings,
there
are
all
kinds
of
fraudulent
transactions
alleged
with
regard
to
(inaudible)
about
stock
transactions.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
mean
that
--
that
that
was
a
factual
situation
that
came
--
that
was
revealed
to
the
public
in
connection
with
the
insul
and
if
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
but
it
also
would
probably
give
a
lead
to
who
the
officers
in
the
insul
empire
were
in
regard
to
all
of
these
various
transactions
that
were
alleged
to
be
fraudulent
about
the
issue
of
the
insul
stock,
if
you
recall,
at
that
time
so
that
i
think
there
was
the
problem
of
whether
a
registration
statement
would
reveal,
although
it
was
not
developed
in
the
case
as
--
as
decided
by
the
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
was
not
suggested
in
this
as
far
as
the
opinion
of
the
court
rules,
but
it
did
deal
with
the
question
of
separability
and
the
duty
of
the
court
to
--
where
there
was
such
a
provision
like
there
is
in
this
case
to
separate
out
a
portion
of
the
statute
that
was
divisible
and
you
said
there
was
a
presumption
in
that
regard
and
it
should
be
followed.
and
therefore,
the
statute
was
found
to
be
enforceable
and
valid.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
what
i
mean
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
that
was
the
heart
of
chief
justice
hughes'
opinion
in
regard
to
it
and
the
contention
was
bitterly
made
that
you
couldn't
consider
a
registration
and
the
registration
of
statement
as
a
separate
matter,
but
you
had
to
--
had
to
consider
them
altogether
and
the
court
said,
"that
was
not
correct
and
that
you
should
take
those
separately.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
mr.
justice
black,
in
the
electric
bond
case,
it
was
claimed
that
that
was
a
death
sentence
act
and
all
of
these
provisions
were
so
extreme,
including
prohibition
of
use
of
mails
for
legitimate
purposes
that
it
would
kill
the
utility
holding
company.
so
the
same
parallel
contention
was
being
made
and
the
court
said
the
examination
should
not
be
made
on
that
basis.
the
question
was
to
carry
out
the
will
of
the
congress
and
deal
with
it
on
a
separable
basis
and
take
each
part
and
see
whether
that
could
be
enforced
in
dealing
with
the
problem.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there
were
all
kinds
of
fifth
amendment
claims
in
that
case,
but
they
were
question
of
whether
you
take
the
property
without
due
process
but
they
were
there
and
they
were
apparent
that
they
were
doing
real
damage.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
it
is
on
the
separability
question.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
the
expressed
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice
and
the
court
said
to
all
those
questions
to
reserve
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
contend
that
they
shouldn't
be
in
this
matter.
they're
all
there.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
don't
think
it
has
any.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
none
at
all,
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned.
it's
merely
a
--
a
recital
of
the
statement
by
congress,
but
it
didn't
act
to
do
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
let
me
try
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
make
myself
plain
on
that,
mr.
justice
black.
the
government
does
not
treat
this
or
believe
that
this
is
just
a
party.
it
thinks
that
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
that
makes
all
of
the
difference
in
the
world.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
we
can
by
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
presumably,
it
has
done
lawful
acts
as
well
as
unlawful
act.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
it
could
do
--
it
could
act
as
a
party,
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
i
think
that
it
would
have
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
he
could
continue
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
congress
was
not
trying
that
issue
that
it's
just
a
party
and
i'm
trying
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that
you
have
to
assume
what
congress
provided
that
it
had
to
be
a
--
a
party
that
was
dominated
and
controlled.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
by
a
foreign
country.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
that
it
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
you
have
to
recognize
the
separability
decision
too
which
--
and
ends
by
the
congress,
so
as
to
carry
out
whatever
there
is
of
the
statute
that
you
consider
to
be
valid
because
that's
a
part
of
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
we
could,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
in
the
first
place,
i
have
not
tried
to
indicate
--
i
thought
the
first
amendment
problem
was
here
but
i
thought
it
was
in
regard
to
each
separate
part
of
it,
as
there
is
a
first
amendment
case
in
a
registration
and
the
registration
statement.
i
don't
want
this
--
help
you
to
understand
that
i
don't
think
there's
any
first
amendment
involved.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
then,
i
think
you
would
have
to
view
it
in
each
question
when
it
becomes
right.
if
the
registration
statement
is
answered
and
they
sign
in
their
names
and
don't
raise
any
fifth
amendment
problems,
i
don't
think
you
have
any
question
or
problem
in
it
whatsoever.
they
have
a
right
to
come
in
and
sign
their
names,
say
they're
officers,
say
who
the
members
are,
what
their
finances
are,
and
that's
their
legal
right
under
the
law
and
this
court
has
so
held.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
of
course
the
--
if
you
would
determine
that
it
couldn't
considered
that
way,
then
i
would
think
you
would
decide
that
congress
is
dividing
for
separability,
although
they've
tried
to
do
it,
could
not
lawfully
do
it.
i
think
that's
the
way
you
would
have
to
decide
what
you're
asking
me
now.
and
that
you
know
they
said
that
it
was
separable
but
you
couldn't
find
if
they
were
separable
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
in
that
case,
you
would
have
to
go
further.
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
in
this
case,
exactly
the
same
distinction
was
made
and
the
court
rejected,
and
said
it
had
to
do
if
it
could,
what
congress
said
and
take
it
piece
by
piece.
nor
to
that
answer
because
i'm
trying
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there
were
claims
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
a
different
kind
of
fifth
amendment.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
you
can
as
to
certain
phases
of
it.
for
instance,
i
think
you
might
well
think
--
consider
that
first
amendment
was
in
the
provisions
in
regard
to
registration
and
the
fifth
amendment
might
be
in
regard
to
some.
but
then
you
got
the
problem
of
the
registration
statements
and
whether
or
not
the
government
can
ask
for
the
information
and
you
have
not
said,
as
i
read
the
case,
that
they
can't
ask
for
the
information.
and
you
say
--
and
you
have
said
they
can't
compel
the
information.
therefore,
until
you
know
whether
someone
is
going
to
invoke
their
privilege
or
give
you
the
(inaudible)
the
government
the
information,
you
don't
have
the
case
ripe
for
decisions
before
the
court
and
i
don't
think
you
reached
that
particular
point,
although
you
reach
others.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
sorry.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
i
said
that
--
i
tried
to
say
and
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
so.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
on
some
of
them,
there
wouldn't
and
in
some
there
would
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
on
the
registration,
i
think
the
facts
would
be
very
important.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that
many
of
those
might
be
right
for
adjudication
in
a
declaratory
judgment,
the
action
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
as
to
those
who
are
members
and
apply
for
a
passport
for
instance,
you
have
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
law
outstanding
at
that
time
that
then
was
--
was
triable
which
is
the
constitutional
right
to
having
a
passport
and
how
you
will
interpret
that
provision
and
--
and
how
the
application
of
the
regulations
to
that
provision
might
be
made.
i
think
that
those
questions,
according
to
your
holdings
in
the
past
and
all
you've
reserved
until
they
come
before
you
with
a
party
who
was
asking
for
that
particular
relief.
well,
then
when
some
organization
claims
it
on
their
behalf,
i
don't
think
that
any
of
your
cases
would
sustain
your
--
a
passing
upon
that
kind
of
question
in
this
context.
now,
time
after
time,
people
appeared
before
this
court
asking
you
to
pass
on
constitutional
questions.
you
say
we'll
never
reach
that
question
because
you
have
to
and
it
seems
to
me,
all
of
those
sanctions
would
have
to
be
treated
under
those
holdings
as
you
adhered
to
when
they
come
up,
depending
upon
on
the
context
in
which
they're
presented
and
not
reaching
out
to
get
them
decided
in
this
case
when
they're
not
necessary.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
but
it
doesn't
appear
that
it's
necessary
to
a
decision
in
this
case
that
those
sanctions
be
passed
upon
now
until
that
particular
case
comes
up,
just
like
in
the
holding
company
act
when
the
death
sentence
provisions
were
passed
upon
when
they
came
up
by
an
independent
procedure.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
it's
clear
they
did.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
you
see
the
act
provides
for
the
registration
without
this
kind
of
a
hearing
too,
voluntary
registration
and
the
congress
was
willing
and
happy
to
have
that
if
they
could
get
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
a
voluntary
registration
without
any
trial
merely
a
--
a
mere
recognition
by
the
party.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
--
they
--
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
want
to
be
misunderstood
to
say
that
they
need
a
responsible
act
which
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
all
i
can
say
is
what
congress
did
say
and
it
was
--
it
very
--
it
very
clearly
said
that
they
could
satisfy
the
requirements
of
registration
by
coming
forward
itself
without
a
trial
or
hearing
or
anything
else
and
say,
"we
do
register."
that
was
one
particular
section
of
it
and
they
wanted
that,
and
it
meant
a
lot
because
it
would
be
a
recognition
that
this
party
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
didn't
say
it's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that
that
is
the
only
party
that
the
government
is
contending
as
valid.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
government
is
contending
for
all
of
that
but
it
does
take
the
position
that
--
that
with
the
separability
clause,
you
take
section
by
section
and
see
what
you
can
sustain
under
the
law
and
that
it
was
--
would
satisfy
one
of
the
purposes
of
congress.
it's
very
important
to
have
them
just
come
forward
and
say,
"we
register
with
nothing
more."
another
purpose
was
to
get
information
in
the
registration
statement
and
i
think
you
can
properly
and
should
consider
that
separately
--
separately.
and
that
the
government
can
ask
questions
and
they
don't
have
to
answer,
which
this
court
has
said.
they
can
say
this
will
incriminate
us,
we
don't
answer
or
would
tend
to
incriminate.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
only
make
that
argument
and
saying,
if
you
find
that
they
can't
do
more,
you
can
say
that
much
is
valid,
but
i
don't
want
to
be
misunderstood
to
say
it
that
i
--
i'm
not
urging
that
you
find
much
more
than
that
valid.
but
i
say
that
congress
said
and
i
can
only
resort
to
their
words,
and
i
think
the
history
is
plain
and
i
think
the
court
in
this
case,
electric
bond
and
share,
said,
"we
turn
to
that
language
and
it
was
contended
by
counsel
that
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
and
congress
wouldn't
have
--
have
urged
any
--
passed
such
a
bill
with
just
the
registration."
that
same
argument
was
made
and
they
said,
"look
at
the
legislative
history,"
and
the
court
said,
"look
at
the
language
that
congress
said."
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
guess
but
--
i
think
that
if
you
read
that
opinion
and
you
examine
it
again,
i'm
sure
you
would
agree
that
it
was
expressly
said
--
said
by
the
court,
that
the
duty
of
the
court
was
to
try
see
if
it
wasn't
separable
and
make
it
such
because
congress
said
so.
that's
where
you
start.
you
don't
start
in
the
other
presumption.
so
it
seems
to
me,
with
that
kind
of
a
presumption,
if
you
have
duty
to
see
if
you
can't
make
any
portion
of
it
standup
alone.
now,
you
might
find
you
couldn't
and
that's
something
else
again.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
there
is
--
the
radiation
that
you
describe
is
involved
in
the
act.
i
think
you
could
say
that
certain
portions
are
valid
without
allowing
the
--
the
other
to
come
into
play
and
that's
what
i
mean
by
taking
step
by
step
to
see
whether
it's
here
and
if
it
is
here,
whether
it's
necessary
and
if
it's
invalid,
you
leave
what
you
can
to
itself.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
can't
answer
the
question
with
the
assumption
because
i'm
only
familiar
with
the
newspaper
accounts
at
the
time
and
i
haven't
examined
that
history.
but
from
the
newspaper
accounts,
it
was
clear
that
congress
wanted
more
and
that
was
the
argument
that
was
made
in
this
particular
case
and
the
court
rejected
it
saying,
"we'll
turn
to
the
language
of
the
separability
clause
that
governs
our
duty
and
we'll
follow."
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there's
no
question
that
there
were
on
the
burden
of
the
argument
of
the
petitioners
in
that
case,
was
that
the
radiation
for
such
that
--
that
registration
in
itself
was
part
of
--
only
a
part
of
what
the
congress
wanted
and
these
other
steps
were
up
--
attached
to
it
and
bound
to
do
them
such
injury.
and
of
course,
the
recitals
in
the
legislation,
the
purpose
of
it
were
the
terrible
evils
that
the
public
utility
holding
companies
were
to
indicate
what
the
congress
was
trying
to
do.
i
think
that
was
clear
that
there
were
plenty
that
would
flow
from
the
mere
registration
and
the
filing
of
the
registrations.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
plenty
of
radiations
as
to
other
effects.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
when
you
say
except
that,
that's
pretty
involved
in
the
section.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
but
they
argued
that
they
were
taking
their
life
away
and
taking
their
properties
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
in
effect
and
all
of
these
property
would
be
destroyed
of
tremendous
values.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
failure
to
register
add
a
penalty
that
they
couldn't
use
the
mails
and
that
was
upheld,
right
in
the
same
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that
was
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
in
the
climate
of
those
days,
i'm
sure
that
registration
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
registration
would
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
registration
in
itself,
mr.
justice
black,
would
have
all
of
the
reflection
and
the
bad
effects
of
being
a
public
utility
holding
company
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
they
fail
to
register
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
i
think
you
(voice
overlap)
seen
in
the
others.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
the
registration
would
be
an
acknowledgment
that
was
involved
in
the
--
in
the
other
files.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
claims
were
that
as
immediately
as
the
one
that
registered,
they
would
lose
all
the
tremendous
values.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
think
the
act
said
in
itself
that
by
registration,
there
would
be
further
consequences.
now,
in
the
same
case
law,
the
court
said
that
the
registration
was
statement
is
also
valid
separately.
and
they
--
and
that
certainly
would
reveal
all
kinds
of
things
that
would
have
damaged
them
and
adversely
affected
the
values
of
their
properties.
it
isn't
personal
rights
but
it
is
property
rights
that
they
were
contending
for.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
very
real.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
would
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
they
would
be
barred
from
getting
the
contributions
from
government
employees
and
they
would
also
have
to
make
a
disclosure
on
their
--
their
label,
their
publications
that
they
were
communist
-action
organization.
that
much
they
would
also
have.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes
and
the
tax
deduction
of
course,
were
a
matter
of
grace
(inaudible)
and
whether
they
were
entitled
to
exemptions
and
on
behalf
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
want
to
try
to
answer
your
question
frankly,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
you're
treating
the
registration
as
being
--
as
being
a
separate
part
when
this
case
treats
both
the
registration
and
the
requirement
of
a
registration
statement
as
being
separable
parts
that
could
be
sustained
separately.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
there
is
left,
the
distance
between
the
two.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
--
i
do
think,
mr.
justice
black,
that
it's
unreal
to
say
that
these
people
weren't
--
wouldn't
be
hurt
under
the
public
utility
holding
act
by
a
registry,
but
it's
not
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
is
not
the
legal
consequence
that
you're
asking
about
but
certainly,
the
mere
fact
that
registering
would
have
its
impact
upon
the
value
of
all
their
property.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
ultimate
question
of
whether
if
you
will
abstain.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
hat's
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no
because
--
because
i'm
saying
you
slice
off
one-half
from
another
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
you
may
not
agree
with
that
but
i'm
trying
to
make
it
clear,
what
i
think
the
congress
said
and
if
you
think
that
out
of
eight
sanctions,
eight
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
didn't
understand
the
question
in
that
way.
i
think
that
if
you
would
say
in
--
in
your
question
as
i
understand
--
your
question
now
that
the
accumulation
of
all
of
them
makes
it
impossible
for
them
to
do
any
lawful
acts.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
then
you
still
have
that
problem.
i
agree
that
you
would.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
i
don't
agree
that
that
problem
is
in
the
case
because
i
--
i
contend,
on
behalf
of
the
government
that
this
is
not
lawful
action
and
i
say
it's
comparable
to
your
situation
in
an
antitrust
case
where
there
is
a
conspiracy,
say,
a
group
get
together
or
by
persons
and
they
agree
in
writing
to
conspire
to
restrain
trade
and
they
put
down
the
various
acts
they're
going
to
take
and
amongst
that
are
a
number
of
acts
that
are
lawful
that
no
one
could
take
offence
to
but
they
will
contribute
to
the
conspiracy
and
if
they
proceed
to
do
any
of
those
acts,
this
court
has
said,
"you
can't
proceed
to
do
lawful
acts
to
accomplish
an
unlawful
purpose."
now,
you
might
not
agree
that
that
is
the
--
what
we
have
before
the
court
here,
but
that
is
the
concept
and
i
think
it's
a
valid
one.
and
i
think
that
when
they
take
peace
for
instance
or
when
they
say,
"in
soviet
russia
today
we
have
a
free
press."
they're
not
talking
the
same
language
that
we
are
and
when
they
say
that
kind
of
thing
or
when
they
say
they're
--
they
have
peace,
they're
for
peace,
they
use
that
as
a
means
to
accomplish
their
--
their
objective
and
their
purpose
to
support
this
foreign
power
and
you
can't
use
lawful
means
for
that
illegal
purpose.
now,
that's
the
difference
whether
you
agree
with
it
or
not,
but
i'm
trying
to
point
out
and
i
don't
think
that
you
can
use
advocacy
either
for
an
unlawful
purpose
if
you
tie
them
together,
trying
to
carry
out
that
unlawful
purpose.
i
think
that's
the
problem
in
the
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
all
i
know
is
what
i
read
in
your
cases
in
this
court
and
constantly,
those
cases
said,
"you
don't
decide
constitutional
questions
until
you
reached
them."
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
in
principle
to
have
them
before
you
in
that
form
that
you'll
consider
this.
and
i
think
time
after
time,
you've
said
that
not
to
instruct
the
lawyers
but
because
it's
basic
to
the
function
and
to
the
duty
that
you
perform
on
behalf
of
the
country.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
i
can
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
said
that
a
number
of
times,
mr.
justice
harlan
but
i
wasn't
saying
the
first
amendment
question
was
not
here.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
i
did
want
to
make
it
clear
on
the
other
constitutional
questions
if
they're
properly
here.
i'm
not
saying
this
court
shouldn't
decide
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
adopted,
shows
that
other
people
disagree
but
the
government
does
not
think
they're
here
now.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
wanted
to
be
clear
that
i
was
not
saying
to
the
court
there
was
no
first
amendment
problem
before
the
court.
but
i
do
say
that
it
is
limited,
and
should
be
taken
step
by
step
as
to
every
single
respect
to
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
that's
our
position.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
not
at
this
point.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
directs
the
party
to
register.
that's
the
effect
of
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
you
--
you
see
the
--
the
whole
act
that
i
was
trying
to
describe
is
conceived
of
the
idea
of
reserving
the
question
of
the
individuals
and
the
individuals,
when
the
party
has
to
act,
then
are
given
a
time
in
which
to
try
to
get
out
of
the
party
if
they
decide
to
do
so.
