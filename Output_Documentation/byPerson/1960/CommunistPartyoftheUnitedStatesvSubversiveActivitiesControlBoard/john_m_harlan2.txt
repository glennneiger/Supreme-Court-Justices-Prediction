justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
have
a
copy
of
the
registration
statement
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
have
a
copy
of
the
registration
form?
justice
john
m.
harlan
solicitor
general
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
doesn't
wholly
(inaudible)
the
fifth
amendment's
point,
doesn't
it,
that
the
validity
to
it
because
the
separability
clause
of
the
statute,
i
take
it,
would
also
reach
to
the
regulation
and
if
we
concluded
that
there
was
merit
to
your
registration
point
that's
--
to
your
fifth
amendment
point
and
struck
the
requirement
of
the
attorney
general
which
would
leave
a
registration
form,
a
compliance
with
the
statute
unsigned
by
any
individual
and
your
fifth
amendment
point
would
have
evaporate,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
far
--
as
far
as
the
officers
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
are
concerned,
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
--
now,
the
other
question
that
you
were
arguing,
as
i
take
it,
is
that
fifth
amendment
reside,
you
cannot
judge
this
statute
unless
we
view
the
sanctions
in
relation
to
the
requirement
for
registration
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
which
is
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
treated
the
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
privilege
that
you're
talking
about
here
is
the
privilege
of
the
officer.
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
that
the
officer
required
to
sign
the
registration
statement.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
not
the
privilege
in
the
members
tell
that
your
claim
--
that
you
claim
would
be
asserted
as
such
at
this
stage
at
least
by
the
officer.
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
but
that
involves
the
first
amendment
not
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
just
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
those
sanctions
all
come
into
play
either
by
the
registration
or
when
made
the
final
order?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
and
the
attorney
general
has
to
send
out
notice
of
the
order
made.
he
has
to
send
out
notice
saying
that
the
organization
is
required
to
register
to
the
members.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
what
i'm
--
my
question
is,
can
a
member
relieve
himself
of
all
of
these
sanctions
by
resigning
to
new
york
position
once
these
--
once
the
order
to
--
to
register
becomes
final?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
the
exception?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
so
that
it
--
to
be
--
to
take
a
specific
illustration
of
the
fellow
ones
who
member
of
a
registered
organization
wants
to
join
the
governmental
service
and
he
bona
fide
him,
makes
a
bona
fide
resignation
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
he's
eligible.
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
after
he
gets
out
of
his
governmental
service,
if
he
wants
to
rejoin
the
party,
is
there
any
reason
why
he
shouldn't?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
i
mean
there's
no
reason
why
he
can't
rejoin.
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
this
--
well,
the
--
the
sanction
and
--
maybe
there's
some
difference
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
what
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
you're
saying
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you're
arguing,
i
take
it,
is
that
he
shouldn't
be
stocked,
the
individual
member
should
not
be
stocked
by
the
board
determination
without
an
opportunity
to
say
that
the
board
is
wrong
or
he
didn't
know
the
illegal
argument
or
the
purposes
of
the
party.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
am
i
wrong
about
what
your
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
if
i
misunderstand
your
argument
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you
mean
--
you
said
he
gets
a
notice.
how
do
you
know
this
is
the
board
determination?
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
you
leave
me
hanging
is
--
well,
i
know
that
because
your
argument
finished.
justice
john
m.
harlan
my
hypothesis
is
he
knows
that
because
the
board
is
asked
for
a
hearing
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
and
made
that
determination.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
but
the
attorney
general's
list
adversary
hearing
would
find
a
judicial
review
by
the
court
with
a
wholly
different
proposition.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
it
seems
to
me
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
what
you're
saying
now
shows
that
i
did
understand
your
argument.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
seems
to
me
what
you're
saying
now
shows
that
i
did
understand
your
argument.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page
is
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
constitutional
argument?
do
you
draw
any
distinction
as
among
the
same
(inaudible)
themselves
as
to
their
(inaudible)
authority
or
you
think
they're
all
bad?
justice
john
m.
harlan
quite
effected
any,
do
you
think
on
the
ultra
vires,
bot
the
ultra
vires,
the
administrative
regulations,
do
you
think
section
1
(b)
which
says,
"nothing
in
this
act
shall
be
construed
or
authorized
or
require
or
establish
military
and
civilian
censorship
or
anyway
limit
or
brings
upon
in
a
depressed
or
a
state
of
guarantee
with
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
no
regulation
shall
be
promulgated
hereunder
having
that
effect."
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
all
became
so
far
as
the
first
amendment
constitutional
plans
is
concerned
and
not
with
respect
to
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
ask
you
this
question.
now
suppose
the
court
in
the
white
case,
every
time,
no
matter
what
the
statute,
a
person
comes
into
the
court
and
says
i
raise
my
fifth
amendment
privilege.
in
a
sense
he
is
giving
the
government
the
lead
because
even
though
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
doesn't
prove
anything
in
the
way
of
guilt,
it
might
suggest
to
a
practical
prosecutor
that
is
they
smell
out
and
look
hard
enough
they
would
be
able
to
connect
him
up
with
something.
justice
john
m.
harlan
therefore,
you
don't
have
to
stand
just
on
the
white
case,
if
that's
a
sound
proposition,
do
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
when
you
(inaudible)
your
position
entirely
here,
it
seems
to
me,
on
the
white
case,
this
fellow
being
(inaudible)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
an
officer.
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
does
(inaudible)
your
some
possible
connections
as
far
as
the
lead
is
concerned
for
the
government.
justice
john
m.
harlan
always,
always
have
been.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
certification
(inaudible)
a
little
further
than
that.
you
ask
us
to
certify
(inaudible)
on
page
5,
how
do
you
think
that
--
that
certification
(inaudible)
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
assumes
your
--
your
regulation
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
of
course,
if
that's
permissible
and
leads
the
registration
statement
as
a
valid
registration
statement
under
the
act,
all
that's
talked
about
in
the
fifth
amendment
(inaudible)
goes
out
the
window.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
think
mr.
abt
did
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
this
registration
statement
can
be
furnished
without
anybody
signing
it
at
all,
at
all,
no
name
on
it,
no
individual
name
on
it,
then
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
problem
as
far
as
an
officer
is
concerned,
does
he
--
is
there
a
--
nobody
signed
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
bothered
by
that
for
this
reason
that
if
we
accept
your
argument
i
would
suppose
if
we
just
have
to
dismiss
this
case
as
improvidently
granted
and
then
let
it
come
up,
i
don't
know
how
in
the
context
is
the
fifth
amendment
claim,
i
--
we
reach
anything
if
we
don't
reach
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
i
have
a
question
to
you,
that
supposing
this
act
is
construed
as
it's
been
argued
here,
it
should
be
construed,
as
requiring
the
force
of
the
attorney
general's
regulation
make
signature
on
the
registration,
aren't
we
now
and
immediately
faced
(inaudible)
the
act
is
unconstitutional
because
it
forces
self-incrimination.
and
if
we're
not
faced
with
that
now,
what
is
--
how
can
we
adjudicate
the
registration
in
the
abstract
so
to
speak
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
a
different
question
and
i
have
said
and
suggested
that
if
view
is
accepted
that
you
are
now
espousing
that
you
can
excise
the
requirement
of
individual
signatures,
the
fifth
amendment
claim
as
distinguished
from
the
first
amendment
claim
disappears
from
this
law
suit,
but
that's
a
different
question.
i'm
not
taking
the
act
on
the
premise
that
has
been
argued
here
by
your
opponents
that
you
can't
excise
that
requirement
with
the
act
as
to
rewriting
of
the
act
and
whatnot
and
that
therefore,
we
have
to
judge
the
fifth
amendment
claim
on
the
premise
that
the
registration
thing
has
to
be
signed
by
somebody
and
my
question
here,
if
that's
true,
then
if
we
don't
reach
the
fifth
amendment
question
now,
what
is
there
left
for
us
to
do
except
to
dismiss
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes
then
we'd
still
be
left
with
--
if
we
decided
all
those,
one
way
the
--
supposing
we
decided
all
those
in
the
government's
favor,
we'd
still
have
a
fifth
amendment
attack
on
the
statute
which
on
your
view,
we
couldn't
reach
it
now.
when
will
we
ever
reach
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
then,
i'm
saying
that
the
--
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
this
case
unreleased
on
the
fifth
amendment
claim,
would
have
to
go
back
and
the
officers
either
come
in
and
say,
â€œwe
refuse
to
sign
or
as
more
likely,
they'll
do
nothing
and
when
--
when
is
this
question
ever
going
to
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
will
it
be
done,
who
they
are?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
only
thing
that's
left
is
floating
around
in
the
air
some
place.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
should
we
do
then
if
that
view
is
accepted
with
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
you
said
those
questions
weren't
here
too
and
that
you
were
just
to
take
simply
the
registration
itself
minus
all
the
sanctions
and
minus
the
fifth
amendment
claim.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
i
thought
that
should
be
there.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
had
put
(inaudible)
supposing
we
took
your
view
and
we
adjudicated
everyone,
all
deficiencies
(inaudible)
except
the
fifth
amendment
finding,
we
say
that
(inaudible)
did
you
--
did
you
consider
that
in
those
circumstances,
any
of
these
sanctions
came
into
effect?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
but
there
would
have
been
a
final
adjudication
as
the
fifth
amendment
claim
is
still
outstanding?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
could
you
say
that,
(inaudible)
adjudicated
fifth
amendment
claim.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
i
assume
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question
and
--
and
i
--
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i
hope
you
cover
the
individual
sanctions.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
john
m.
harlan
sorry.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
want
to
take
up
any
much
of
your
time
but
answer
this
question,
putting
aside
the
fifth
amendment
claims
in
a
--
on
a
question
of
sanctioning,
assuming
if
we
were
to
accept
your
argument
that
we
should
not
reach
any
of
the
sanction,
would
there
be
any
other
factors
other
than
the
factors
which
are
present
now
that
would
--
present
in
the
adjudication
of
the
sanction
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
basically,
your
basis
that
aren't
equally
before
us
now.
justice
john
m.
harlan
which
ones?
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
registration,
i'm
talk
--
i'm
talking
about
sanctions
distinguishing
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
aren't
they
equally
ripe
now?
but
why
aren't
they
equally
ripe
now?
justice
john
m.
harlan
alright,
this
is
the
question
originally.
now,
they
say
this
is
the
question,
a
part
of
the
constitution
attack
here
(inaudible)
the
--
that
this
(inaudible),
it's
part
of
the
constitution
in
terms
under
registration
provision.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
all
of
the
questions,
whether
we
decide
the
sanctions
now
or
whether
of
the
statute
that
he
can
build,
whether
values
has
a
priority
to
impose
the
elements
--
the
elements
of
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
the
sanctions
are
good
and
congress
had
the
power
to
pass
on
the
outlawry
claim,
has
no
dependable
distance
to
that
saying.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
the
ultimate
question
whether
we
review
the
sanctions
as
it
is
viewed
now
or
whether
we
view
them
piecemeal
as
they
arise,
ultimately,
the
question
you
have
to
decide
in
either
instances
whether
the
sanction
is
justifiable
to
--
to
his
constitutional
(inaudible)
in
this
sense.
justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
suppose
the
assumption
to
the
that
is
here
now,
whether
you
carve
it
up
or
(inaudible)
up
or
you
could
package
it
that
denies
the
distinguished
constitutional
question
that
the
individual
members,
independently
in
the
organization
that
were
raised.
it's
a
different
problem.
but
the
first
amendment
question
is
right
here
whether
you
carve
it
up
or
whether
you
deal
with
it
as
a
package
in
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
you're
not
postponing
any
first
amendment
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
wouldn't
you
say
--
wouldn't
you
say
that
their
summary
of
this
whole
discussion
is
that
either
courts
with
a
permissible
cause
for
the
court
to
adopt,
the
court
of
appeals
shows
to
regard
this
as
a
package
and
their
--
their
view
can
be
expressed
--
that
judgment
to
be
equally
well
postpone
adjudication?
and
could
adjudicate
the
sanctions
if
you
wished
to,
but
either
course
would
be
permissible.
