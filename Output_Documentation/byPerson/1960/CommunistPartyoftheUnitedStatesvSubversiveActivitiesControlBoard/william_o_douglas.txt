this
is
on
the
first
review?
justice
william
o.
douglas
does
the
regulation
ended
up
to
a
part
of
this
law?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
(d)
is
the
statement
for
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
registration
statement
that
i
all
--
i
suppose
i
have
to
look
at
this
to
find
out
what
that
involved.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
your
form
has
precluded
as
signing
of
the
court
to
rule
without
more.
justice
william
o.
douglas
we
have
more,
under
your
argument
--
your
position
on
just
the
political
disclosure
because
there
certain
possibility
that
would
pass
to
the
register,
if
you
didn't
pass
it
from
those
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
(voice
overlap)
and
put
down
ultimately
to
the
question,
i
suppose
and
in
these
case,
of
whether
any
words
of
the
electric
bond
and
share
opinions
i
have
used,
the
various
parts
are
so
interwoven
that
you
--
you
must
know
how
to
disposes
of
the
one
question
of
treatment
or
treat
more
than
just
that
one
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
think
those
words
were
interwoven.
justice
william
o.
douglas
my
difficulty
is
that
once
a
registration
statement
of
the
form
of
--
prescribed
by
the
attorney
general
if
filed
with
all
the
data,
a
lot
of
other
things
come
into
play.
we
know,
state
laws,
loyalty
boards,
boards
of
education,
state
laws
that
disqualify
people
from
holding
though
a
certain
jobs,
would
seem
to
come
into
play.
there's
a
radiation
from
it
that
that
is
very
pronounced,
isn't
that
--
wouldn't
that
be
true?
