before
you
proceed,

it
any
part
at
all
in
the
government's
theory
that
the
very
giving
of
false
answers
to
the

with
respect
to
arrest
and
the
very
giving
of
false
answers
or
incomplete
answers
with
respect
to
the
organizations
that
the
petitioner
belong
to,
that
those
very
falsehoods
are
evidence
of
his
bad
moral
character?
being
quite
apart
from
the
materiality
of
the
information
that
would
have
been
elicited
had
he
given
the
truth?
