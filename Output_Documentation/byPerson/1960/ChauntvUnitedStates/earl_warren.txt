mr
forer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
forer,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
roberts.
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
by
that
do
you
mean,
to
--
i
believe
that
there
should
be
a
remand,
mr.
roberts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
also
if
there
is
a
remand,
what
court
should
remand,
remain?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
the
circuit
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
didn't
that
last
language,
the
last
phrase
that
you
used
indicate
that
the
--
that
the
reason
for
this
was
to
determine
that
the
result
within
conviction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
concede
then
mr.
roberts
that
the
mayor
answering
of
these
questions
concerning
these
minor
arrests
is
not
sufficient
to
--
to
cause
his
denaturalization?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
--
do
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
contend
that,
as
justice
stewart
asked
you,
that
the
mere
failure
to
state
the
truth,
in
respect
to
some
minor
arrest
of
this
kind,
is
in
itself
sufficient?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that
gets
--
it
gets
a
little
far
afield
in
the
question
i
was
asking.
let
me
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
refer
to
you
in
a
very
--
very
simple
form.
suppose
these
arrests
instead
of
being
for
what
they
were,
were
three
arrests
for
parking
too
close
to
a
fire
hydrant
and
he
had
answered
that
he
had
not
been
arrested.
would
that
--
would
that
have
been
sufficient
in
your
judgment
just
because
it
was
wrong
to
justify
his
denaturalization?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
they
didn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
question
whether
a
judge
would
do
it
or
not
under
the
statute.
is
--
is
that
sufficient
grounds?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
don't
know
whether
i
got
a
yes
or
no
or
maybe
answer
there
but
--
but
i
still
would
like
to
--
to
ask
you
if
--
if
under
your
theory,
it
would
be
sufficient
to
denaturalize
this
man
if
he
answered
that
he
had
not
been
arrested
or
in
fact
he
had
been
arrested
two
or
three
times
for
parking
too
close
to
a
fire
hydrant.
now,
that's
a
rather
simple
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
said
it
was
wrong.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
thing
in
the
record,
mr.
roberts,
about
the
character
of
these
pamphlets
or
the
character
of
this
harangue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
wasn't.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understand
it
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
you
--
you
get
back
to
the
question
i
--
i
asked
you
if
a
--
if
a
man
made
a
false
statement
as
to
one
part
in
particular,
too
close
to
a
fire
hydrant,
do
you
believe
that
it
would
be
a
permissible
interpretation
to
this
act
to
say
that
it
could
be
denaturalized
for
that
statement?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
we're
talking
about.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
just
want
to
know,
i
thought
justice
harlan
want
to
know
if
--
if
any
false
statement
would
be
sufficient
in
your
opinion
to
--
to
do
it
under
the
law.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
forgot
it
to
be
a
different
thing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
talking
about
it
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
may
respond
the
course
if
you
wish,
mr.
forer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
the
court
of
appeals?
