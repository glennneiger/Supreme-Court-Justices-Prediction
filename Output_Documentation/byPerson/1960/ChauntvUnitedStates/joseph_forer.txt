mr.
joseph
forer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
denaturalization
case,
which
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
petitioner,
peter
chaunt,
was
born
in
hungary
and
he
came
to
this
country
in
1921,
when
he
was
22
years
old.
on
june
27,
1940,
he
filed
a
formal
petition
for
naturalization
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york.
and
on
that
date,
he
was
interviewed
by
examiners
for
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
they
passed
him
and
recommended
his
naturalization.
and
on
november
28,
1940,
the
eastern
district
admitted
him
to
citizenship.
i
think
it
is
of
some
relevance
that
he
was
admitted
to
citizenship
under
the
nationality
act
of
1906.
the
1940
nationality
act,
which
superseded
the
1906
act
had
already
been
passed,
but
was
in
effect
until
sometime
in
1941.
anyway,
on
november
28,
1940,
he
became
a
citizen.
thirteen
years
later,
the
government
brought
a
denaturalization
suit
in
california
under
section
340(a)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
alleging
that
he
had
procured
naturalization
by
concealment
and
misrepresentation
and
asking
for
a
judgment
cancelling
his
citizenship.
the
complaint
alleged
concealments
and
misrepresentation
on
three
subjects.
and
the
first
subject
was
on
an
arrest
record.
briefly,
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
in
the
naturalization
proceedings,
chaunt
has
been
asked
if
he
had
ever
been
arrested
and
he
said
he
had
not
been
arrested
and
in
fact
he
had
a
record
of
several
arrests.
i
will
at
a
subsequent
point
in
detail
what
those
arrests
were.
and
the
second
ground
was
that
he
had
concealed
communist
party
membership
that
having
been
asked
whether
in
effect
whether
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
he
had
denied
it
and
this
denial
was
untrue.
and
the
third
ground,
i
would
lump
together
in
one
alleged
that
he
had
misrepresented
his
attachment
to
the
constitution
disposition
to
the
good
order
and
happiness
of
the
united
states
and
he
has
intend
to
owe
allegiance
to
the
united
states.
and
those
three
allegations
as
to
his
--
what
you
might
call
as
political
state
of
mind
when
i
refer
--
if
i
referred
to
him
again,
i
will
call
them
the
attachment
ground.
but
those
were
the
three
subjects
of
misrepresentation
alleged.
arrest,
communist
party
membership
and
attachment.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
what
the
complaint
alleged
and
that's
what
the
evidence
--
well
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
there
was
nothing
in
the
questionnaire
and
the
reason
why
there
is
nothing
in
the
questionnaire
was
because
there
was
nothing
in
the
statute.
mr.
joseph
forer
but
the
--
the
--
the
immigration
examiner
according
to
the
word
of
his
testimony,
asked
them
two
questions
relevant
to
that
subject.
one
was,
do
you
believe
in
communism,
fascism
or
nazism.
in
which
he
answered
no,
according
to
the
immigration
examiner.
and
the
other
was,
according
to
the
immigration
examiner,
that
he
asked
on
what
organizations
do
you
belong
to,
and
he
answered,
"the
international
workers'
order."
and
apparently
no
others
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
no,
this
questionnaire
has
that
same
famous
question
28,
that
no
act
(inaudible).
mr.
joseph
forer
the
same
questionnaire.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
right,
same
questionnaire.
mr.
joseph
forer
well
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
the
reason
i
--
i
--
i
hitched
it
a
bit
was
because
the
immigration
examiner,
naturally
enough,
could
not
testify
as
to
what
had
actually
happened
at
the
interview.
he
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
all
he
could
testify
to
was
what
was
his
practice
as
to
what
questions
he
asked
and
what
some
of
his
symbols
--
sort
of
hieroglyphic
symbols
meant.
now
as
to
the
arrest
ground,
this
we
should
be
clear
on,
that
was
on
one
of
the
forms,
and
as
to
that
ground,
it
wasn't
just
what
the
practice
of
the
examiner
was
to
ask,
although
the
examiner
testified,
it
was
his
practice
as
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
mr.
joseph
forer
certainly
not
--
mr.
joseph
forer
his
recollection
and
his
notations.
mr.
joseph
forer
well
that
was
the
--
that
--
that
was
the
practice
then
and
the
--
i
don't
know
what
the
current
practice
is.
i
know
that
it
used
to
be
the
regular
practice
because
in
every
denaturalization
suit
that
i've
seen
that
participated
in,
it
was
always
the
same
way.
mr.
joseph
forer
the
issue
was
raised
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
i
wouldn't
--
one
of
the
defenses
was
that
the
evidence
was
not
sufficiently
show
that
he
had
asked
those
questions.
yes,
that
was
one
of
the
issues
i
think.
but
i'd
like
to
get
away
from
the
communist
question
to
get
to
what
i
think
is
the
real
question
which
is
the
arrest
question.
i
said
there
were
three
grounds
of
misrepresentation
or
three
subjects
of
misrepresentation
alleged.
with
the
complaint,
it
was
filed
an
affidavit
of
good
cause
as
required
by
the
statute.
but
the
affidavit
only
alluded
to
two
of
the
grounds
of
misrepresentation,
namely,
the
ones
as
to
communist
party
membership
and
the
ones
as
to
what
--
what
i
have
quote
attachment
to
the
constitution.
and
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
affidavit
relating
to
arrest
or
the
concealment
of
arrest.
and
this
is
really
conceded
by
the
government
in
its
brief.
now,
the
case
went
to
trial
and
the
trial
court
ordered
the
--
the
petitioner's
naturalization
cancelled,
making
findings
adverse
to
the
petitioner
on
all
three
subjects
contained
in
the
complaint
including
the
arrest
subject,
which
was
not
contained
in
the
affidavit.
mr.
joseph
forer
the
--
the
petitioner's
los
angeles
lawyer
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
original
complaint.
one
of
the
grounds
of
which
was
that
the
complaint
that
as
to
the
arrest
ground,
stated
in
the
complaint,
that
was
an
invalid
ground
because
it
was
not
covered
in
the
affidavit
of
good
cause.
thereafter,
the
government
amended
its
complaint,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
case
went
to
trial
on
a
second
amended
complaint.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
all
of
the
complaints
set
forth
all
three
grounds.
mr.
joseph
forer
the
affidavit
only
set
forth
two.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
and
it
becomes
acute
for
this
reason.
the
appellant
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
that
the
judgment
solely
on
the
arrest
ground,
that
is
solely
on
the
ground,
which
was
not
covered
in
the
complaints.
and
it
didn't
reach
at
that
point.
mr.
joseph
forer
not
covered
in
the
affidavit,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
joseph
forer
eleven
of
what?
my
brief
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
yes,
that's
the
arrest
you're
referring
--
mr.
joseph
forer
--
to
arrest.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
should
say
i
was
not
the
trial
counsel
on
that
but
that
was
obviously
what
was
intended
in
the
government.
but
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
denaturalization
on
the
one
subject
that
was
not
in
the
affidavit,
and
then
it
said
that
since
the
arrest
support
the
judgment,
we
don't
have
to
go
into
the
other
two
subjects
of
alleged
misrepresentation
namely,
communist
party
membership
and
attachment.
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
the
lawyer
did
not
raise
it
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
he
--
he
--
he
raised
it
on
--
with
regard
to
the
first
complaint.
the
--
the
district
court
ruled
against
them
and
he
didn't
raise
it
against
thereat.
but
without
going
now
into
further
factual
details,
i
would
like
now,
which
i
will
mention
when
they
become
appropriate.
i
would
like
now
to
argue
my
first
point
which
as
basically
already
been
stated
by
justice
frankfurter,
and
that
is
that
the
natural
--
the
judgment
of
the
court
below,
he
stand
because
it
was
based
on
a
misrepresentation
or
concealment,
which
is
not
alluded
to
in
the
affidavit.
now
in
the
zucca
case,
the
court
said
that
the
filing
of
this
affidavit
of
good
cause
is
a
prerequisite
through
filing
and
maintaining
a
denaturalization
action,
and
it
has
to
be
filed
with
the
complaint.
and
the
year
or
two
after
zucca
and
that
was
a
companion
cases,
the
court
said
that
this
prerequisite
what
it
said
in
the
statute
and
was
so
important
that
you
couldn't
cure
the
failure
to
file
an
affidavit
upon
--
with
the
complaint
by
amendment,
and
you
couldn't
have
a
late
filing
and
an
amendment
of
the
complaint
so
as
to
make
a
valid
denaturalization
action
or
a
valid
denaturalization
judgment.
now,
here
we
have
an
affidavit,
but
so
far
as
the
ground
of
denaturalization
is
concerned
and
as
the
case
is
now
before
us,
the
ground
of
denaturalization.
the
ground
on
which
petitioner
was
denaturalized
is
the
one
ground
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
had.
insofar
as
the
ground
for
denaturalization
is
concerned
therefore,
we
have
no
affidavits.
now
we
do
have
an
affidavit
on
other
grounds,
but
not
an
affidavit
on
the
ground
on
which
denaturalization
was
a
decree.
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
same
as
having
no
affidavit
at
all.
and
the
matter
was
virtually
anticipated
by
a
sentence
in
the
court's
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
harlan
in
the
nowak
case.
and
in
the
nowak
case,
the
--
one
of
the
issues
was
whether
or
not
the
affidavit
of
good
cause
was
sufficient,
because
it
wasn't
based
on
personal
knowledge,
but
based
on
matters
seen
in
the
files
and
records
of
the
immigration
service.
and
the
court
held
that
that
affidavit,
even
though
not
based
on
personal
knowledge
was
sufficient
because
it
said,
it
fulfilled
the
general
purpose
of
the
affidavit
requirement.
and
in
setting
out
what
these
purposes
were
and
how
it
fulfilled
it,
the
court's
opinion
in
nowak
said,
and
i
think
this
was
the
first
thing
it
said
on
the
subject
"in
substance,
the
affidavit
set
forth
the
same
matters
upon
which
the
district
court's
later
decree
of
denaturalization
was
based."
now
then
it
went
on
and
mentioned
other
matters.
but
the
first
thing
to
which
the
opinion
called
attention
to
was
that
the
affidavit
matched
the
judgment.
in
this
case
of
course,
it
doesn't
match
the
judgment.
mr.
joseph
forer
you
had
no
such
issue
but
you
have
that
language
and
this
was
part
of
the
ratio
decidendi.
now
on
principle
--
mr.
joseph
forer
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
or
if
it
--
it
may
not
be
entirely
a
jurisdictional
question,
but
whether
it's
jurisdictional
or
quasi
jurisdiction,
it
was
a
statutory
prerequisite
which
from
there,
adjudicating
that
issue
that
there'd
be
the
affidavit,
and
since
that
prerequisite
was
not
meant,
the
adjudication
of
that
issue
was
error.
that's
what
--
mr.
joseph
forer
yes,
i
--
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
that
is
the
issue
and
what
i'm
trying
to
argue
now
is
that
in
the
light
of
the
--
the
holding
first
in
the
--
the
holding
and
the
was
that
you
can't
amend
your
complaint.
secure
it.
secondly,
in
the
light
of
the
statement
in
nowak,
and
third,
in
the
light
of
the
purpose
of
the
affidavit
which
i'm
going
to
come
through,
it
is
the
first
alternative
that
i
think
is
--
is
the
one
that
is
the
correct
one
that
should
be
followed.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
first
--
yes.
i
--
yes
(voice
overlap).
well
i
will
just
get
rid
of
the
precedents
before
--
mr.
joseph
forer
--
i
came
to
the
purpose.
and
the
purpose
was
stated
in
the
zucca
case.
it
said
the
purpose
of
the
affidavit
is
to
protect
the
individual
that
is
denaturalized
citizen,
so
that
he
shall
not
feel
obliged
to
defend
his
citizenship
and
to
defend
his
reputation
unless
at
least
the
government
first
has
this
probable
cause.
in
other
words,
it's
a
matter
of
reputation
because
in
zucca,
the
court
pointed
out
that
mere
--
even
the
allegation
can
damage
the
citizen
so
that
congress
intended
that
the
allegations
shouldn't
be
made
without
having
this
showing
of
just
cause.
and
the
situation
you
have
here
is
that
the
petitioner
here
had
its
reputation
damaged
with
respect
to
concealment
of
arrest,
and
he
have
to
defend
his
citizenship
with
respect
to
alleged
falsification
of
arrest
without
this
safeguard
of
the
affidavit
that
the
court
in
zucca
said
was
a
prerequisite
and
the
purpose
of
which
was
to
protect
the
citizen
from
even
having
to
defend
his
citizenship
and
his
reputation.
now
the
government
says,
well
after
all,
he
was
already
suffering
because
the
other
two
causes
of
action
are
sustained
by
the
affidavit.
now
that's
like
saying
that
if
the
government
has
a
right
to
give
a
man
one
black
eye,
he
has
a
right
to
give
him
two
black
eyes.
now
because
they
have
a
right
to
do
something
which
injures
--
injures
the
reputation
in
one
respect,
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
have
a
right
to
tear
away
every
last
strip
of
his
reputation,
and
because
the
affidavit
gave
him
a
right
to
make
this
man
defend
his
reputation
insofar
as
something
about
communism
was
concerned
that
doesn't
mean
that
he
had
no
reputation
left
and
therefore
they
had
a
right
to
put
him
to
the
test
of
defending
his
reputation
and
a
citizenship
so
far
as
falsification
of
arrest
are
concerned.
and
if
the
government
is
right,
what
they
could
in
this
case
have
alleged
only
arrest
in
the
affidavit
and
confine
the
litigation
entirely
to
the
matters
of
communism
even
though
they
weren't
mentioned
in
the
affidavit.
and
certainly,
that
would
be
under
the
present
environment
of
very
serious
blow
to
his
reputation.
and
yet,
if
the
government
is
right,
the
safeguard
of
the
affidavit
would
not
be
required
on
that
subject.
or
if
the
government
is
right,
they
can
file
an
arrest
on
subject
a,
let
us
say
concealment
of
arrest,
let
us
say
concealment
of
the
number
of
years
in
this
country
and
then
they
go
to
trial,
they
don't
even
litigate
the
subject
in
the
arrest.
they
litigate
all
kinds
of
other
subjects,
some
of
which
maybe
very
damaging
to
the
man's
reputation.
so
it
is
my
position
that
if
you
are
to
give
the
affidavit,
the
function
which
it
was
intended
and
are
to
serve
its
purpose,
then
you
have
to
confine
the
litigation
to
the
ground
in
the
litigation
as
the
court's
opinion
in
nowak
recognized.
and
now
i
want
to
come
to
the
next
point
of
my
argument
which
maybe
described
as
the
materiality
point.
now
the
petitioner
here
in
the
denaturalization
proceeding
did
say
that
he
had
never
been
arrested
and
as
to
this,
there's
no
problem
because
on
one
of
the
forms,
he
answered
“no”
when
he
was
asked
that
he's
never
been
arrested
or
charged
of
violation
of
any
law.
and
there's
no
question
but
that
the
evidence
demonstrates
that
in
fact,
he's
been
arrested
three
times
all
in
new
haven,
connecticut.
in
all
three
arrests
occurring,
10
to
11
years
prior
to
his--
the
time
he
filed
his
application
of
citizenship.
and
i'd
like
to
tell
you
what
these
arrests
were
because
the
factual
situation
becomes
crucial.
the
first
arrest
was
on
july
30th,
1929
and
this
arrest
was
on
a
charge
that
the
petitioner
had
violated
a
new
haven
city
ordinance
by
distributing
handbills
on
the
public
street.
the
petitioner
pleaded
not
guilty
and
he
was
discharged
and
that's
the
first
arrest
in
this
disposition.
incidentally,
the
text
to
the
ordinance,
under
which
this
--
he
was
arrested
in
which
the
warrant
was
issued,
appears
on
the
record
at
pages
69
and
70.
the
court
of
appeals
was
mistaken
when
they
make
the
observation
of
their
opinion
that
the
text
of
this
and
the
second
ordinance
was
not
before
the
trial
court.
in
fact,
the
text
of
the
two
ordinances
because
this
one
would
be
--
what
i'll
mention
next
were
introduced
as
government
exhibit
without
any
opposition
or
objection
by
the
petitioner.
so
as
i
say
that
was
the
first
arrest.
needless
to
say,
i
think
it's
quite
obvious
you
look
at
the
ordinance
and
look
at
the
charge
by
the
way
that
in
the
light
of
jamison
against
texas
subsequent
cases,
this
new
haven
ordinance
was
unconstitutional.
the
second
arrest
occurred
on
december
21st,
1929.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
don't
think
it's
particularly
important.
i
don't
think
so.
but
for
whatever
bearing
it
has,
the
ordinance
was
plainly
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
at
least
with
the
hindsight
of
the
supreme
court
decision
to
decide
it
afterward.
on
december
21st,
1929
which
was
also
more
than
10
years
before
the
petitioner
applied
for
his
naturalization,
he
was
arrested
on
the
charge
that
he
had
violated
the
new
haven
park
regulations
by
making,
and
i'd
better
quote
this,
“an
oration,
harangue,
or
other
public
demonstration
in
new
haven
green,
outside
of
the
churches.”
the
--
this
--
he
pleaded
not
guilty
to
this
offense
and
the
disposition
is
unclear
in
the
record
as
everybody
admits
including
the
court
of
appeal
and
so
i
don't
know
whether
he
was
convicted
or
not
convicted
or
acquitted
or
what
happened.
i
don't
think
it's
important.
i
would
mention
that
the
maximum
fine
under
this
ordinance,
in
fact,
the
only
penalty
under
the
ordinance
was
applied
now
with
fine.
and
i
might
say
it's
also
clear
that
this
ordinance
was
unconstitutional
because
it
said
that
nobody
should
be
allowed
to
make
an
oration,
harangue,
or
other
public
demonstration
in
the
green
and
outside
of
the
churches
that
is,
unless
he
got
special
authority
the
commissioner
has
gave
no
standards
for
the
commission
to
exercise.
so
under
crook
(ph)
against
new
york,
decided
some
years
later,
that
was
under
unconstitutional.
the
third
arrest
also
occurred
more
than
10
years
before
the
application
and
that
occurred
on
march
11,
1930
and
that
arrest
was
on
a
complaint
issued
by
the
new
haven
city
attorney
which
charged
that
the
petitioner
committed
general
breach
of
the
peace
and
that's
all
it
said.
it
didn't
say
wherein
he
committed
a
general
breach
of
the
peace
and
i
suppose
one
might
claim
that
it
wasn't
sufficient.
they
definitely
state
any
kind
of
cause
of
action.
anyway,
the
petitioner
here
pleaded
not
guilty.
first,
he
filed
the
demurrer
which
was
overruled
by
whittaker,
jay
but
he
was
convicted
after
that
demurrer
was
overruled.
he
was
convicted
by
the
city
court
and
was
found
to
--
found
guilty
and
fined
$25
and
he
appealed
that
to
the
county
court
which
made
it
a
--
a
trial
de
novo
and
on
appeal
the
case
was
null
so
that
the
ultimate
disposition
of
that
case
was
also
--
no
conviction.
so
those
are
the
three
arrests,
10
or
to
11
years
of
prior
to
the
application
of
citizenship,
all
of
them
of
the
utmost
trivial
charges
nothing
involving
the
moral
turpitude
or
anything
like
that,
none
of
it
resulting
in
convictions
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
one
in
which
he
might
have
been
fined
$5
and
that
two
of
them
on
obviously
unconstitutional
orders.
and
the
question
arises
whether
concealment
of
this
tribute
justifies
denaturalization.
now,
the
government
recognizes
that
a
--
and
admits
that
you
can
only
denaturalize
for
a
material
concealment
or
misrepresentation.
mr.
joseph
forer
well
there's
just
no
evidence
on
that
one
way
or
another
and
the
court
found
that
it
wasn't
in
good
faith.
mr.
joseph
forer
and
i
didn't
raise
that
in
my
petition.
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i
don't
--
my
argument
applies
no
matter
what
is
bad
faith
was.i
accept
it.
i
mean
i'm
just
not
--
i'm
not
claiming
that.
now
the
government
says
you'll
have
to
suppress
a
material
of
fact
or
not
only
of
material
concealment
or
misrepresentation
to
justify
denaturalization
and
then
they
start
examining
and
analyzing
the
meaning
of
the
word
material
in
the
light
of
case
law
and
judicial
definitions
and
public
policy
and
whatever
are
the
considerations
that
the
courts
has
taken
to
account
in
determining
what
a
concept
or
a
word
means.
and
they
end
up
that
--
frankly,
i
don't
know
what
they
think
material
mean.
my
approach
is
entirely
different
because
i
say
it
isn't
a
question
of
the
case
law
or
definition
of
the
word
material.
i
say
that
if
you
must
use
it,
the
technique
--
the
issue
in
terms
of
materiality
which
maybe
a
little
misleading,
i
say
that
the
statute
has
a
built-in
definition
of
materiality
and
this
is
my
approach.
if
you
look
at
these
statutes,
it
doesn't
authorize
denaturalization
on
account
of
any
concealment
or
misrepresentation.
it
only
authorizes
denaturalization
in
cases
where
the
naturalization
was
procured
by
concealment
or
misrepresentation.
so
under
the
statute,
the
test
of
materiality
is,
did
the
falsification
or
suppression
procure
the
naturalization.
if
it
didn't
procure
the
naturalization
then
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
how
material
it
maybe
in
terms
of
case
law
in
other
field,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
statute
and
it
doesn't
authorize
denaturalization.
and
when
you
say
that
the
falsification
or
suppression
must
have
procured
denaturalization,
what
you
are
saying
is
that
the
test
of
materiality
is
--
did
the
falsification
make
the
difference
between
getting
denaturalization
and
not
getting
denaturalization.
if
it
wouldn't
have
made
difference,
if
the
true
facts
had
been
revealed
then
obviously
the
suppression
of
the
true
facts
did
not
procure
the
naturalization.
so
how
do
you
apply
this
test
that
i'm
saying,
the
test
of
did
the
falsification
procure
the
naturalization?
the
first
thing
you
have
to
do
is
to
look
at
what
where
the
conditions
for
naturalization
at
the
time
of
naturalization?
in
this
case,
you
would
look
at
the
1906
act
and
see
what
the
requirements
and
conditions
were
for
naturalization
and
then
you
have
to
ask
yourself
two
questions.
first,
would
the
facts
which
were
suppressed
have
in
themselves
justify
the
naturalizing
court
in
denying
naturalization?
if
they
did,
then
obviously
by
suppressing
those
facts,
the
applicant
for
naturalization
procured
naturalization
by
this
fraud
and
you
can
end
the
inquiry
there,
and
an
example
would
be
where
if
the
naturalization
statue
require
five
years
residence
and
the
applicant
said,
“well,
i've
lived
here
five
years”,
in
fact,
he'd
only
lived
there
four,
obviously,
that
falsification
procured
denaturalization.
but
you
don't
stop
there
because
--
let's
assume
a
situation
like
here
for
instance
where
the
facts
which
were
suppressed
would
not
in
themselves
have
justify
denaturalization.
nevertheless,
the
suppression
might
have
procured
denaturalization
if
the
true
facts
had
they
been
disclosed,
would
have
led
to
discovery
of
other
facts
which
would
have
resulted
in
just
or
which
would
have
justified
the
naturalizing
court
in
denying
the
naturalization.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
forer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honor.
i
was
saying
at
the
recess
that
in
order
to
meet
the
statutory
requirement,
that
a
suppression
had
procured
denaturalization.
it
follows
as
logically
and
inevitably
that
you
have
to
show
one
of
two
things.
either
that
the
true
facts,
if
disclosed,
within
themselves
have
justified
the
naturalizing
court
in
denying
naturalization
under
the
then
applicable
standards
of
naturalization
or
two,
that
the
true
facts,
if
disclosed,
would
have
led
to
the
discovery
of
other
facts,
which
if
known,
would
have
justified
the
naturalizing
court
in
denying
naturalization.
now,
if
i'm
right
and
this
becomes
a
crucial
issue,
then
you
can't
say
that
a
person
shall
be
denaturalized
because
the
suppressed
facts,
which
if
disclosed,
might
have
or
would
have
led
to
an
investigation.
because
if
i
am
right,
you'll
also
have
to
then
go
on
and
show
that
the
investigation
would
have
discovered
facts
which
would
have
justify
denaturalization
or
which
you
have
justified
a
refusal
of
naturalization.
if
the
investigation
would
have
been
fruitless,
in
the
sense
that
it
would
not
have
discovered
anything
to
the
man's
discredit
or
would
not
have
discovered
anything
that
would
have
justified
denial
of
naturalization,
then
the
investigation
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
he
got
naturalization
or
didn't
get
naturalization,
it
therefore
has
no
bearing
on
whether
or
not
denaturalization
was
procured
by
the
misrepresentation.
and
i
--
i
think
if
we
will
see,
that
is
the
principal
issue
between
my
position
and
the
opposition
of
the
court
below.
and
i
think
my
position
follows,
not
only
from
the
language
of
the
statute
which
says
that
you
can
denaturalize
only
if
naturalization
was
procured
by
the
suppression,
but
it
also
follows
from
the
principle
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
announced,
which
is
in
substance
that
in
a
denaturalization
case,
the
defendant,
denaturalized
citizen
is
given
every
possible
benefit,
both
on
the
facts
and
on
the
law.
and
i
think
that's
particularly
important,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
seems
to
be
no
statute
of
limitations
and
no
rule
of
laches
so
as
to
prevent
the
government
from
bringing
stale
cases
many
years
after
naturalization
was
obtained.
now,
i
think
it
is
apparent
that
if
my
test
of
materiality,
which
i
think
is
the
statutory
test,
is
applied
to
this
case,
then
the
--
the
judgment
below
was
wrong
in
holding
that
the
petitioner
was
rightly
denaturalized
on
the
arrest
ground.
if
you'll
look
at
the
statute
which
set
the
rules
at
the
time
of
naturalization,
namely
the
1906
naturalization
act,
there
was
only
one
ground
which
had
any
possible
relevance
to
the
subject
of
arrest.
and
that
was
the
requirement
of
the
statute
that
before
an
alien
could
be
naturalized,
he
had
to
be
--
be
a
person
who
had
behaved
for
the
five
preceding
years
as
a
person
of
--
of
good
moral
character
and
attached
to
the
constitution.
now,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
if
you
use
the
first
branch
of
my
test,
that
if
these
arrests
had
been
disclosed,
they
would
not
have
justified
the
naturalizing
court
in
holding
that
the
then
alien
did
not
meet
the
requirement
of
five
years
good
character.
first
of
all,
the
arrests
were
remote.
they
were
10
years
before
the
petition
not
within
the
five-year
period.
secondly,
they
had
no
application
to
a
man's
character
anyway,
since
they
were
for
trivial
offenses,
did
not
result
in
convictions
and
at
least
two
of
them
were
--
were
unconstitutional
offenses.
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
claim
and
did
not
hold
that
the
arrest,
if
they
had
been
divulged,
would
have
justified
the
denial
of
naturalization.
so,
i
think
we
can
--
i
can
get
safely
pass
the
first
prong
of
my
test
of
materiality.
this
leads
to
the
next
--
the
next
branch
of
my
test,
and
that
is,
did
the
suppression
of
the
arrest
result
in
suppressing
facts,
which
if
known
or
if
discovered,
would
have
other
facts,
which
if
discovered,
would
have
justified
the
denial
of
naturalization.
now,
in
the
first
place,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
claim
that
that
was
the
situation
either.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
in
their
opinion
and
it's
perfectly
clear,
and
this
is
at
pages
95
and
96
of
the
record.
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
only
thing
that
mattered
was
that
the
falsification
blocked
an
investigation
and
it
didn't
make
any
difference,
what
the
investigation
would
have
discovered.
and
it
didn't
make
any
difference
that
if
the
investigation
had
been
held,
nevertheless,
naturalization
might
have
been
granted.
now,
for
the
reasons
i've
already
gone
into,
that
seems
to
be
clearly
wrong.
so,
let's
come
now
to
a
--
to
apply
the
correct
test,
which
is,
would
the
investigation
have
disclosed
a
disqualifying
factor
to
the
facts.
the
only
testimony
in
the
record
on
this
subject
was
offered
by
the
government's
witness,
the
hearing
examiner,
the
--
for
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service,
a
man
by
the
name
of
derringer,
and
i
quote
this
testimony
in
full,
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
17
and
running
on
to
page
18
of
my
brief.
and
derringer
testified
that
if
a
person
had
an
arrest
record,
an
investigation
would
follow
but
he
testified
that
the
only
thing
the
investigation
would
do,
would
be
to
verify
the
facts
concerning
the
arrest.
and
that's
what
he
said,
would
be
just
to
check
whether
or
not
the
listing
of
arrest,
for
instance,
had
been
accurate
and
complete.
so,
if
you
take
derringer's
testimony,
if
the
petitioner
had
disclosed
his
arrest
record
or
if
you
take
derringer's
testimony,
the
only
thing
an
investigation
would
have
disclosed
is
the
identicals
matter
concerning
the
arrest
that
we
know
now
and
then
it's
now
in
the
record.
and
as
i've
already
said,
obviously,
those
trivia
in
themselves
would
have
not
had
justified
refusal
of
naturalization
and
the
court
below
recognize
that
they
would
not
have
justified
refusal
of
naturalization.
so
on
derringer's
testimony
and
that
is
the
only
testimony
there
is
in
the
record,
there
is
nothing
to
--
derringer's
testimony
negatized
and
there's
no
other
testimony
for
the
contrary,
any
assumption
that
an
investigation
would
have
discovered
any
disqualifying
fact.
and
when
you
consider
that
the
government
has
the
burden
in
a
denaturalization
case,
approving
all
essential
parts
of
each
case
by
clear,
unequivocal
and
convincing
evidence
which
does
not
lead
the
issue
in
doubt,
then
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
if
the
government,
as
i
say
it
had,
had
the
burden
of
showing
that
there
was
a
dena
--
disqualifying
fact
in
the
background,
which
an
investigation
would
have
led
to,
then
the
government
has
not
carried
that
burden
because
the
only
testimony
in
the
record
is
to
the
contrary.
now,
the
government,
in
its
brief,
now
subs
--
tries
to
substitute
a
complete
speculation
for
proof.
they
say
that
at
the
time
of
these
arrests,
1929
and
1930,
they
say
that
the
record
shows
that
at
or
about
that
time,
the
petitioner
was
a
district
organizer
for
the
communist
party
in
connecticut.
and
they
say,
well,
it
seems
we
--
it
seems
likely
or
it
can
be
assumed
that
if
the
service
have
had
the
information
about
the
arrest,
it
would
have
investigated
the
arrest
and
presumably
the
arrest
would
might
have
had
something
to
do
with
his
activities
as
an
official
of
the
communist
party,
and
then
the
service
would
have
discovered
from
the
arrest
that
he
was
therefore
a
--
had
been
a
district
organizer
for
the
communist
party
and
this
might
have
led
to
a
denial
of
naturalization.
now,
there
are
about
four
things
wrong
with
that
argument.
the
first
argument
is
that
it
is
a
complete
speculation,
which
can't
possibly
meet
the
test
for
denaturalization,
which
has
been
repeatedly
announced
by
the
court.
it
not
only
has
no
evidence
to
support
it,
it
is
a
speculation
and
direct
contradiction
to
the
testimony
of
derringer.
in
the
second
place,
there
is
no
competent
evidence
in
this
record,
that
at
the
period
of
the
arrest,
the
petitioner
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
was
a
district
organizer
in
--
for
the
communist
party
in
connecticut.
there
is
incompetent
evidence
on
that
subject
in
the
record,
consisting
of
some
hearsay
testimony
by
john
lautner,
the
government's
perennial
witness
and
of
some
articles
in
the
daily
worker.
but
i
don't
even
--
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
important
fact
because
even
if
you
accepted
the
hearsay
testimony
as
establishing
membership
in
the
communist
party
at
this
period,
nevertheless,
there
is
nothing
in
record
to
show
that
the
arrest
had
anything
to
do
with
the
communist
party
or
that
the
investigation
of
the
arrest
would've
led
to
anything
to
that
sort.
and
i
may
also
say
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
membership
in
the
communist
party
at
that
time
would've
been
irrelevant
anyway
for
a
large
number
of
reasons.
one
reason
is
that
it
was
10
years
before
the
petition
for
application
and
not
within
the
five-year
period.
the
other
reason
is,
and
under
the
1906
act,
that
communists
were
not
barred
from
naturalization
nor
for
that
matter
were
persons
belonging
to
organizations
advocating
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
and
schneiderman,
for
example,
was
naturalized
under
the
1906
act
and
this
court
held
in
the
schneiderman
case
that
--
that
didn't
seem
to
be
anything
wrong
with
that.
now,
in
my
original
brief,
i
said
nothing
about
or
made
no
argument
about
the
two
grounds
of
denaturalization
other
than
the
arrest
ground,
namely
the
--
what
i've
called
the
"communist
party
ground"
and
what
i've
called
the
"attachment
ground."
and
the
reason
i
didn't
argue
those
two
grounds
was
because
the
court
of
appeals
hadn't
discussed
them
and
said
that
it
didn't
have
to
consider
them.
and
i
assume
as
i
said
in
the
footnote
in
my
brief,
that
under
those
circumstances,
if
this
court
thought
that
i
was
right
on
either
of
my
--
either
of
the
points
that
i
raised
so
that
the
judgment
was
wrong,
so
far
as
the
arrests
were
concerned,
that
the
court
would
follow
the
normal
practice
of
remanding
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
dispose
off
and
decide
the
remaining
issues,
namely,
the
communist
and
attachment
ground.
in
its
brief,
the
government
alleged
as
an
independent
ground
for
sustaining
the
judgment
below,
that
there
had
been
a
misrepresentation
as
to
membership
in
the
communist
party.
the
government
didn't
allege
what
i
call
the
"third
ground"
as
an
independent
ground.
they
didn't
talk
about
the
"attachment
ground"
but
they
urged
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
below
even
if
the
court
below
is
wrong
on
the
arrest,
on
the
grounds
that
there
had
been
a
misrepresentation
as
the
communist
party
membership.
and
the
assumption
in
the
government's
brief
is,
that
it
--
the
court
ought
to
do
this
even
though
it's
an
exception
to
its
usual
remand
practice
because
there
isn't
any
factual
issue
or
no
real
dispute
on
the
facts
and
it's
just
the
question
of
law.
so
in
my
reply
brief,
i
took
up
this
question.
now,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
this
issue
has
to
be
decided
and
it's
up
to
the
court
whether
the
court
wants
to
decide
it
or
whether
it
wants
to
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
it.
that
is
it
has
to
be
decided
if
--
if
i
am
right
on
either
of
my
first
big
point.
and
i
wouldn't
presume
to
tell
the
court
whether
it
should
decide
it
or
whether
it
shouldn't
waste
its
time
and
let
the
court
of
appeals
decide
it.
but
since
the
issue
was
raised
in
my
reply
brief,
i
did
analyze
the
record.
i
analyzed
the
facts
and
i
think
i
showed
that
there
--
not
only
is
there
a
factual
question
but
that
the
only
correct
resolution
of
the
factual
question
is
that
the
petitioner
did
not,
did
not
lie
on
the
subject
of
communist
party
membership,
or
that
the
government
did
not
prove
that
there
had
been
any
misrepresentation
or
suppression
on
that
issue.
this
depends
on
--
on
rather
complicated
and
involved
state
of
facts.
in
addition
to
that,
i
went
on
and
said
that
the
subject
was
not
--
was
not
a
material
subject
within
my
definition
in
any
event
under
the
1906
act.
now,
for
present
purposes,
since
i
don't
know
whether
the
government
still
adheres
for
its
position,
that
there
basically
is
no
factual
dispute.
i
would
like
to,
unless
the
court
appeals
otherwise,
reserve
any
possible
discussion
on
the
suppression
as
to
or
alleged
suppression
as
to
communist
party
membership
until
after
the
government's
argument.
and
for
that
reason,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
joseph
forer
thank
you
sir.
mr.
joseph
forer
thank
you
sir.
first
of
all,
i
don't
understand
mr.
roberts
when
he
says
that
the
petitioner
did
not
raise
in
the
court
of
appeals
the
question
of
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
on
the
communist
party
ground
because
i
have
here
a
copy
of
the
appellant's
opening
brief
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
on
page
2,
they
have
a
statement
of
points
and
it
--
i'll
read
you
just
the
first
statement
of
the
first
points
stated.
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
--
and
he
--
you
don't
have
that
here
but
he
--
he
told
you
that
the
questions
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
was
not
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals.
but
the
very
first
point
reads
as
follows.
appellant
here
asserts
the
following
points,
one,
that
the
evidence
received
that
the
trial
was
insufficient
to
support
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
and
that
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
are
not
supported
by
the
evidence.
the
second
point
is
that
the
judgment
isn't
supported
by
the
finding.
on
its
first
point
is
that
the
findings
are
not
exploited
by
the
evidence.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
--
let
me
say
this.
i
have
trouble
understanding
his
brief
and
his
reply
brief.
and
the
whole
thing
is
--
i
don't
know
if
it's
--
what
it
discusses
or
what
it's
in
discussion
of.
there
is
a
few
sentences
that
it's
more
almost
like
an
outline,
like
maybe
the
kind
of
outline
that
i
have
here
when
i
get
up
to
argue
with
the
case.
there
are
few
sentences
in
his
reply
brief
that
indicates
to
me
that
he
at
least
differently
raised
the
--
the
precise
question
of
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
that
i
raised
in
my
replied
brief
mr.
joseph
forer
i
may
also
say
--
mr.
joseph
forer
it's
all
--
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
he
--
mr.
roberts
said
perhaps
he
shouldn't
remand
because
he
doesn't
know
whether
the
ninth
circuit
will
consider
the
point
because
they
may
say
the
point
wasn't
raised
before
them.
and
i
was
just
calling
to
your
attention
that
as
i
read
the
briefs,
the
point
was
raised
before
them
at
least
as
well
as
any
other
point
was
raised
before
it.
mr.
joseph
forer
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
that's
true
of
the
other
points,
justice
harlan.
and
nevertheless,
the
ninth
circuit
wrote
an
opinion.
so,
that
--
i
was
just
trying
to
give
you
the
facts
on
this
particular
matter
which
mr.
roberts
mentioned.
i'd
now
like
to
bring
up
the
point
that
justice
stewart
alluded
to.
it
maybe
true
that
lying
to
the
naturalization
examine
law
on
a
matter
which
is
not
material
maybe
evidence
of
bad
moral
character.
and
when
i
say
not
material
i
mean
not
material
in
the
sense
that
the
lie
wouldn't
made
it
--
that
note
was
purposeless
in
the
sense
that
if
he
told
the
truth,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
but
that's
to
an
irrelevant
fact,
justice
stewart,
because
of
the
fact
that
the
denaturalization
statute
does
not,
as
it
now
reach
and
as
it
passed
since
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
was
enacted,
does
not
authorize
denaturalization
just
because
the
person
was
ineligible
for
naturalization.
it
does
not
authorize
denaturalization
because
naturalization
was
wrongly
or
improvidently
or
even
illegally
granted.
it
authorizes
denaturalization
only
where
there
was
a
misrepresentation
or
concealment.
this
incidentally
is
a
change
in
the
law.
so
the
fact
that
the
man
was
a
person
of
bad
moral
character,
even
if
was
--
he
was
shown
to
be
such
by
his
misrepresentation,
does
not
bring
him
under
the
denaturalization
statute.
mr.
joseph
forer
or
concealment.
mr.
joseph
forer
it
doesn't
say
it
in
--
in
those
words.
mr.
joseph
forer
it
says
that
you
will
be
denaturalized
an
account
of
a
naturalization
which
was
procured
by
a
concealment
or
misrepresentation
and
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
that
naturalization
was
procured
by
a
falsification
unless
you
show
that
it
is
a
falsification
which
made
a
difference
to
the
result.
now,
let
me
get
in
terms
of
the
fire
plug
parking
analogy,
and
i
think
that's
very
good
to
show
the
differences
between
us.
now,
i
--
it
seem
to
me
that
mr.
roberts
vacillated
somewhat
on
his
answer
to
whether
lying
about
fire
plug
parking
was
or
was
not
a
denaturalizing
fact
and
i
thought
that
he
ended
up
by
saying,
"yes,
it
was
caused
for
denaturalization
but
maybe
a
judge
or
the
immigration
service
in
such
circumstances
would
give
the
individual
a
break
and
they
wouldn't
--
they
wouldn't
press
it."
now,
the
way
i
look
at
it
is
this.
i
say
that
if
the
alien,
the
applicant
for
naturalization
lied
about
this
fire
plug
parking,
it
might
or
might
not
be
cause
for
denaturalization.
if
all
you
showed
was
that
he
lied,
then
you
haven't
carried
the
burden
of
materiality,
because
obviously
he
has
not
suppressed
a
fact
which
would
have
made
any
difference
to
the
naturalizing
court.
so
if
the
government
really
wants
to
use
that
to
denaturalize
him,
then
they
should
do
it.
there
might
be
a
case
in
which
they
should
do
it
then
the
government
might
show
that
this
man
parked
in
front
of
the
fire
hydrant
because
he
was
trying
to
--
to
perpetuate
a
scheme
of
arson
and
this
was
a
way
of
doing
it.
and
if
he
had
told
the
immigration
service
about
this
arrest,
you
--
it
might
reasonably
have
led
the
immigration
service
to
discover
an
attempted
arson
and
if
they
had
discovered
that,
that
might
well
be
relevant
to
his
good
moral
character
and
might
have
led
the
naturalizing
court
to
deny
him
citizenship.
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
you
can't
look
at
it
from
a
point
of
abstraction
like
they're
doing
about.
is
it
the
kind
of
thing
that
sounds
bad
or
it
doesn't
sound
bad?
the
burden
is
on
the
government
to
show
whether
or
not
that
misrepresentation,
whether
it's
about
fire
plug
parking
or
anything
else
would
resulted
in
or
had
in
effect
on
the
procurement
of
naturalization
and
that
very
often
maybe
a
question
of
fact.
a
question
of
what
was
--
why
did
he
conceal
this
fire
plug
parking.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
--
i
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
no,
justice
frankfurter.
i
--
i
can't
agree
with
that.
in
the
first
place,
very
frequently,
the
arrests
which
have
been
suppressed
are
arrests
which
indicated
bad
moral
character
from
their
nature.
you
can
always
--
mr.
joseph
forer
--
check
the
conviction.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
don't
mean
the
arrest.
well,
so
why
--
so
why
should
you
denaturalize
a
man
on
account
of
that?
mr.
joseph
forer
but
he's
got
a
burden.
that's
--
that's
entirely
speculative
here.
he
--
the
government
has
the
burden
of
showing
that.
mr.
joseph
forer
if
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
i
don't
think
so.
suppose
he
--
he
lies
about
an
arrest
which
resulted
in
the
conviction
for
murder.
that
wouldn't
be
safe.
mr.
joseph
forer
not
on
this
form
particularly.
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
joseph
forer
the
form
said
not
--
not
that
form
has
said,
"have
you
ever
been
arrested?"
well,
it's
easy
enough
to
check
it.
well,
the
form
is
in
there,
but
let
me
just
make
one
additional
point
in
answer
to
your
question,
justice
frankfurter.
the
longer
that
the
government
waits,
the
harder
it
is
to
get
at
the
facts
here.
that's
obvious.
and
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
joseph
forer
well
--
but,
you
have
no
time
limit
here.
this
--
they
can
convict
the
man
for
perjury
if
it's
a
really
mat
--
if
it's
a
material
allegation.
this
is
a
question
of
putting
an
additional
sanction
on
but
it's
a
sanction
which
has
no
time
limit.
now,
they
can
wait
13
years
like
they
did
here
or
32
or
33
years
like
they
did
for
costello
and
--
mr.
joseph
forer
--
of
course
its
(inaudible)
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
i
don't
think
you're
encouraging
lying.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
the
policy
judgment
was
made
by
congress
when
it
said
a
naturalization
procured
by
misrepresentation.
in
the
second
place,
any
--
any
dilution
or
any
rule
of
materiality
can
be
said
to
encourage
lying
in
that
sense.
and
in
the
third
case
--
place
it
just
proves
too
much.
if
--
if
you
say
you
had
a
rigid
materiality
standard
that
encourages
lying,
then
you
can
say
that
it
--
they
have
any
materiality
standard
in
encourages
lying
and
you're
driven
to
what
the
third
circuit
did
in
the
montalbano
case
which
is
quoted
approvingly
by
the
government
in
their
brief
on
page
29.
and
they
said,
"as
long
as
the
government
fought
the
question
was
worth
asking
that
makes
the
question
material
in
the
individual
is
under
a
burden
to
answer."
now,
i
don't
think
that's
a
sound
rule
and
it
throws
materiality
out
of
the
window.
and
it's
particularly
an
unsound
rule
when
you
think
of
some
of
the
questions
that
some
of
the
subordinate
officials
or
the
immigration
service
thinks
worth
asking.
thank
you.
