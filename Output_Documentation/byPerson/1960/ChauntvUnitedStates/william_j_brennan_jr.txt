justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
see
if
i
get
this
clearly
mr.
roberts.
you're
speaking
now
that
your
second
point
in
your
brief,
the
judgment
is
independently
sustained
by
the
force
(inaudible)
who
are
communist
party
membership.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
is
it
your
point
that
no
question
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
no
point
was
made
of
the
alleged
insufficiency
of
the
evidence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
for
which
reason
you
think
if
we
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
if
petition
prevails
on
the
other
point,
the
court
of
appeals
may
say,
"no,
you
can't
be
heard
now.
you
didn't
raise
it
in
your
last
year."
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
wasn't
that
exactly
the
question
that
justice
stewart
fits
you,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
your
answer
is
that
that
would
be
evidential
of
a
lack
of
good
moral
character?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
the
time
of
his
making
the
false
statements.
