justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
--
when
you
said
according
to
the
immigration
examiner,
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
a
stenographic
minute
of
the
examiner?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
were
no
stenographic
minutes
of
the
interview.
justice
felix
frankfurter
aren't
--
aren't
the
interview
by
the
immigration
expected
normally
taking
down
stenographic
minutes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
subsequently
depends
on
his
recollection
on
what
took
place.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
--
that
is
the
practice
not
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
it
argued
at
the
trial
that
the
issues
have
to
be
limited
to
the
two
affidavit
designated
subjects.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
it
for
all
three
grounds?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
affidavit
did
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
your
contention,
is
it
--
i'm
jumping
ahead
that
the
--
that
the
main
issue
must
be
restricted
to
the
claims
made
in
the
affidavit
of
good
cause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
should
think
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
whether
the
requirements,
the
affidavit
sets
forth
all
the
grounds
where
competent
determination
is
a
prerequisite
to
the
courts
considering
the
case.
well
--
or
whether
an
affidavit
is
necessary
giving
grounds
that
show
good
faith
and
consideration
and
responsibility,
etcetera,
etcetera.
and
then
as
it
could
in
other
litigations,
you
can
amend
your
--
your
complaint
as
it
were.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
the
--
your
third
--
your
third
inquiry
is
really
the
first
ones,
the
crucial
one.
this
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
go
ahead.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
do
you
think
that
why
judicial
administrations
to
this
court
remand
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
ninth
circuit
for
them
to
decide
whether
questions
are
open
for
them
to
consider
and
have
them,
if
they
say,
they're
not
open,
shut
it
off?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
you
had
an
official
campaign
with
this
idea.
justice
felix
frankfurter
only
to
decide
what's
the
--
at
least
to
whether
they
should
decide.
justice
felix
frankfurter
nearly
meant
to
stay,
i
don't
mean
to
imply
that
it
wouldn't
be
wise
--
it
would
be
wise,
inappropriate
circumstance
for
this
court
to
have
the
court
of
appeals
--
a
court
of
appeals
to
deny
the
record
on
the
fact.
i
would
wrestle
myself
to
(inaudible)
inadvisable
where
this
court
send
the
case
back
for
examination
on
the
fact
if
the
court
of
appeals
should
think
it
--
it's
free
to
examine
the
fact.
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
very
sceptical.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
because
he
lied
as
i
understand
you.
as
i
--
as
i
understood
justice
stewart's
question
was
whether
only
a
part
from
the
quality
of
his
arrest,
what
it
was
that
he
was
arrested
for?
if
he
suppressed
disclosure
and
thereby
lied,
told
an
untruth
as
i
understood
his
question
what
would
not
telling
the
truth
with
reference
to
think
that
might
not
have
precluded
his
naturalization
was
the
mere
non-disclosure
effect
because
it
was
non-disclosure
be
a
barred
to
his
naturalization?
as
i
understood
you
to
say
at
--
at
most
you
were
dubious.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
about
supposing
instead
of
rehashing
with
somebody
else,
just
full
ask
you
a
few
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
were
three
--
in
this
record,
they
played
three
grounds
for
denaturalization
as
claimed
by
the
government.
one
that
he
didn't
tell
the
truth
about
his
arrest,
two
that
he
didn't
disclose
his
communist,
and
three
that
there
is
a
lack
of
attachment,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
were
all
those
three
grounds
urged
before
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
--
so
that
they
were
only
--
specifically
was
it
nebulously
urged?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
at
all
events,
the
court
of
appeals
only
went
on
one
ground.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
suppose
that
ground
comes
under
a
cloud,
either
because
of
the
--
the
suppression
didn't
bar
further
relevant
testimony
which
might
have
barred
his
naturalization
or
because
where
they
were
or
wasn't
arrested,
it
was
doubtful
as
that.
suppose
that
ground
alone
doesn't
satisfy
but
rather
reject
in
grating
statute
which
you've
laid
down
in
the
schneiderman
and
what
was
the
other
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
baumgartner.
now,
suppose
one
reaches
the
conclusion
that
the
record
doesn't
sustain
--
satisfy
what
this
court
has
ruled
now
and
whether
it
settled
doctrine.
the
necessary
quantum
of
proof
and
denaturalization
cases,
suppose
one
reaches
that
conclusion,
what
then
does
one
do
with
the
case?
can
we
go
on
the
other
grounds?
we
can't
do
that
because
non-concept
that
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
the
tribunal
that
in
all
but
there
are
cases,
exceptional
cases
should
have
the
last
say,
didn't
have
the
last
say
on
that,
that
was
end
up
to
be
a
remission
to
that
court
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
doesn't
bear
on
materiality
that
bears
on
whether
you
can
say
that
there
was
a
misrepresentation
because
if
the
question
is
validly
or
dubious
or
ambiguous
then
the
answer
necessarily
must
be
ambiguous,
but
the
question
that
justice
harlan
asked
to
the
discipline.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
we
--
in
order,
that
we
supposed
a
clear
question,
not
a
two
phasing
--
two
phasing
questions
on
a
two
phasing
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
your
argument
(inaudible)
--
if
your
argument
is
that
if
a
person
is
arrested
even
for
parking
at
the
wrong
place,
would
that
short
--
shut
off
inquiring
that
may
open
up
relevant
material
considerations
for
the
denial
of
the
denaturalization
may
open
up
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
the
man
may
park
at
the
wrong
place
for
very
serious
reasons.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
your
argument
in
the
cases,
it
was
a
good
deal
that
you
block
the
use,
where
do
you
use
that
(inaudible)
whether
it
blocks
the
inquiry,
i
don't
see
how
--
why
the
district
court
should
enter
upon
entirely
whether
they
did
or
didn't
block.
how
could
you
tell
five
years
later
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
refer
discussing
hypothetical
situations,
what
would
you
say
with
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
on
--
on
the
basis
of
what
did
it
sustained
the
de
--
denaturalization
between
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
was
all
arrest,
but
they
didn't
--
judge
maris
didn't
go
into
what
kind
of
arrest
to
conceal,
did
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
their
importance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
their
--
for
their
potential
disqualifications
or
what
it
might
lead
to
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
there
were
three
--
he
was
asked,
"are
you
arrested?"
and
said
no.
in
truth
and
in
fact,
he
knowing
suppressed
of
fact
that
there
had
been
(inaudible)
isn't
that
all?
isn't
that
the
decision
of
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
thought
the
district
--
i
thought
the
district
court
found
other
ground
which
should
have
followed
the
close
result
in
naturalization.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
chief
justices'
permission
and
submit
to
the
court
the
cases
in
which
courts
heard
what
you
said
they
sometimes
do
namely
--
namely
that
while
there
is
--
while
there
was
a
suppression
for
truth
or
full
--
full
consideration
makes
it
likely
that
he
could
be
readmitted
and
therefore
(inaudible)
which
you
said
there
were
such
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
wouldn't
you
go
back
into
department
you
consulted
your
associate
if
there
are
opinions
even
unreported
opinions,
would
you
be
good
enough
to
submit
it
to
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
what
the
(inaudible)
--
what
the
--
why
is
this
relevant
to
anything
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we
have
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
statute
say
that
there
must
be
a
misrepresentation
which
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
concealment,
which
we
prospectively
canvassed
and
considered
would
have
barred
examine
of
the
citizenship?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
what
words
does
it
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
practical
--
as
a
practical
thing,
as
a
practical
thing,
as
i
see
it,
we
attended
many
naturalization
proceedings
along
though,
what
you're
doing
is
reading
out
of
the
propriety
of
the
regulation
or
the
inquiry,
an
inquiry
to
whether
a
man
was
arrested,
as
a
practical
thing,
it
means
was
on
the
holding
that
he
lied
about
whether
you
arrest
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
practically,
it's
ultimately
possibly
to
have
carried
out
to
--
to
put
the
burden
on
the
government
that
if
he
had
told
the
truth,
nothing,
no
consequence
would
have
happened
rather
than
to
the
ultimate
judgment
on
naturalization.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
there
must
be
millions
of
arrests
that
have
no
such
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
that
in
this
case,
they
might
find
out
his
associations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
about
how
you
can
arrest
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
no,
but
you
--
then
it
wouldn't
--
he
also
has
to
answer
whether
he
is
being
convicted
of
any
crime.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
ask
about
that?
(inaudible)
whether
he's
been
convicted
of
felony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
partly
because
they
have
been
shut
off
from
getting
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
with
you
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
--
i'm
with
you
on
that.
i
have
long
stories
but
they
didn't
--
my
own
experience
would
be,
i'm
in
32
years
but
you're
in
20s.
i'm
with
you
on
that
but
there
would
be
a
time
limit.
but
we
can't
--
because
of
the
--
there
is
no
time
limit
indulging
rules
that
encourage
lying.
