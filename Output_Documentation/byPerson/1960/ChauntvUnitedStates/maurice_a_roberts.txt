mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps
at
the
outset,
i
should
clarify
the
government's
position
with
respect
to
the
question
which
counsel
for
petitioner
just
raised.
when
we
filed
our
brief
in
this
court,
we
had
supposed
that
the
fact
findings
below
with
respect
to
the
petitioner's
membership
in
the
communist
party
at
the
time
of
his
naturalization
were
not
questions.
for
the
reasons
that
we
stated
in
our
brief
on
the
merits,
we
felt
that
there
was
no
dispute
as
to
the
evidence
and
we
feel
we
were
justified
in
taking
that
position
but
it
seems
now
that
we
were
wrong.
petitioner
does
dispute
the
evidence
underlying
the
district
court's
fact
findings.
under
the
circumstances,
we
feel
we
cannot
ask
this
court
to
decide
these
factual
questions
on
a
very
large
record
without
the
sifting
process
in
the
ninth
circuit,
and
without
having
that
particular
issue
briefed.
i
might
point
out
that
the
adequacy
of
the
evidence
in
this
regard,
was
not
raised,
or
briefed,
or
argued
in
the
ninth
circuit.
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
we
assumed
that
there
was
solely
a
question
of
law
with
respect
to
the
communist
party
concealment
which
this
court
could
determine
and
could
affirm
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
found
below.
now,
turning
to
the
specific
issues,
i'd
like
to
add
one
further
word
though.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
if
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
if
--
if
we
are
incorrect
in
our
view
that
the
judgment
is
sustained
by
the
arrest
concealment
then
the
only
basis
left
would
be
the
communist
concealment.
and
since
questions
of
fact
are
raised
with
respect
to
that,
then
we
feel
that
this
court
might
wish
to
remand
rather
than
plowing
through
this
record
initially.
i'd
like
to
point
this
out
though.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
well,
i
think
that
would
go
to
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that's
right
because
it
was
that
court
which,
free
to
admit
it,
this
issue.
i
--
i
must
point
this
out
though.
these
questions
were
not
specified
as
errors
in
the
ninth
circuit.
i
don't
know
whether
the
ninth
circuit
would
consider
them
open
and
if
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
disposed
to
consider
this,
perhaps
we
might
want
to
brief
the
matter
in
the
light
of
these
objections
which
are
now
raised
it
seems
to
us
for
the
first
time,
but
denaturalization
is
important.
and
if
there
are
questions
with
respect
to
the
evidentiary
basis
for
the
findings,
we
--
we
receive
from
our
request
that
there
be
an
affirmance
on
the
alternative
basis
for
judgment
because
evidently,
we
were
wrong
when
we
assumed
that
--
that
petitioner
conceded
the
fact
as
found
by
the
district
court.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
no,
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
can
only
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
can
only
say,
as
counsel
said
that
we
cannot
tell
this
court
or
ask
this
court
to
decide
a
question
of
substantiality
of
evidence
on
a
large
record.
that
--
that's
a
matter
entirely
for
this
court.
now,
it's
true
that
this
court
does
review
the
evidence
in
denaturalization
cases
and
ordinarily,
it
does
so
after
the
facts
have
been
sifted
by
the
two
lower
courts.
i
don't
know
what
to
tell
this
court
in
that
respect.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
well
i
--
i
cannot
tell
what
the
reaction
of
the
ninth
circuit
would
be,
i
think
that
its
rules
were
not
complied
with
but
of
course
the
ninth
circuit
might
still
consider
this
factual
question.
i
just
can't
tell.
it
is,
may
i
say
this.
this
is
to
remain
only
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
this
question
arose
only
because
we
had
assumed
in
our
brief
that
the
issue
had
not
been
raised,
that
only
a
legal
issue
was
decided
or
was
--
was
proffered
to
the
ninth
circuit
for
decision.
and
that,
that
legal
issue
had
been
free
to
admit
it.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
yes,
sir.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
yes,
sir.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
yes
sir.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
felt
i
had
to
raise
that
possibility.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
there
would
be
a
little
point
in
remanding
to
the
district
court
because
the
district
court
has
already
considered
the
adequacy
of
the
evidence
and
has
found
it
to
be
ample
to
sustain
its
findings.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that
--
that
i
do
not
know.
as
an
alternative,
this
court
could
consider
the
adequacy
of
the
evidence
on
its
own
and
of
course
this
court
does
in
denaturalization
cases
review
the
adequacy
of
evidence.
we
--
we
don't
say
that
it
should
necessarily.
it
is
an
avenue
that
is
open
to
this
court
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
this
was
not
raised
below.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
oh,
yes.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
yes,
sir.
i
think
this
court
can
notice
errors
which
were
not
urged
below
or
were
not
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
well,
we
don't
think
that
the
claim
is
supportive
but
it
is
not
frivolous.
i
mean
the
petitioner
can
argue
the
point.
it's
a
matter
of
how
you
evaluate
the
evidence
in
this
large
record.
summarizing
briefly
the
issues
before
this
court,
the
district
court
found
as
fact
but
that
at
the
time
the
petitioner
filed
his
petition
for
naturalization
in
1940,
he
concealed
and
misrepresented
the
fact
that,
as
the
district
court
found,
since
1929
at
least,
he
had
been
a
member,
officer
and
full
time
functionary
of
the
communist
party.
and
the
district
court
found
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
at
the
time
he
petitioned
for
naturalization.
the
district
court
also
found
that
he
had
misrepresented
and
concealed
his
arrest
record
back
in
1929
and
1930.
and
the
district
court
found
that
as
a
result
of
these
misrepresentations
and
concealments,
the
government
has
been
precluded
from
making
an
adequate
investigation
of
the
petitioner's
qualifications
for
naturalization.
and
that
as
a
result,
the
naturalization
examiners
had
recommended
that
his
petition
be
granted
and
that
the
court
had
granted
the
petition,
the
naturalization
court,
without
these
items
having
been
adequately
sifted.
the
court
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
there
is
some
question.
the
record
indicates
that
he
had
been
convicted
on
the
third
charge,
the
breach
of
peace.
he
evidently
took
an
appeal
and
there
was
a
trial
de
novo
under
the
practice
in
connecticut.in
the
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
the
--
a
new
information
was
filed
and
a
nolle
prosequi
was
entered.
so
that
in
the
final
analysis,
there
was
no
conviction
on
that
charge.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
no,
sir,
the
statute
is
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
it
was
the
act
--
the
act
1906
under
which
this
petitioner
was
naturalized.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
it's
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
section
4,
subdivision
4.
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
that
is
stated
in
the
--
our
brief.
but
if
i
may,
i
have
a
copy
of
the
statute
right
here
and
if
i
may
read
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
the
part,
yes,
sir.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
this
--
this
is
from
the
nationality
act
of
1906
as
amended
in
1929
and
this
was
a
statute
in
effect
in
1940
when
petitioner
filed
his
petition.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
it
is
in
the
--
it
was
34
statute
596
as
amended
by
the
1929
act
which
is
45
statutes
1512
and
section
4,
read
as
follows,
"no
alien
shall
be
admitted
to
citizenship
unless,
one,
immediately
preceding
the
date
of
his
petition,
the
alien
has
resided
continuously
within
the
united
states
for
at
least
five
years
and
within
the
county
where
the
petitioner
resided
at
the
time
of
filing
his
petition
for
at
least
six
months."
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
no.
actually,
this
is
the
--
the
part
on
which
we
rely.
during
all
the
periods
referred
to
in
this
subdivision,
he
has
behaved
as
a
person
of
good
moral
character,
attached
to
the
principles
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
well-disposed
to
the
good
order
and
happiness
of
the
united
states.
the
question
of
arrests,
we
feel,
is
geared
to
the
requirement
that
the
petitioner
show
good
moral
character.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
don't
think
that's
contained
in
--
in
the
brief.
if
i
may
give
the
court
this
background
perhaps,
it
might
answer
your
question,
justice
black.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
oh
the
--
the
statute
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
the
statute
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
the
statute
makes
no
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
the
statute
does
not
mention
an
arrest
as
a
basis
for
denial.
the
statute
does
provide
for
the
requirement
of
good
moral
character
and
the
rank
of
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
oh,
no.
no.
not
necessarily.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
oh
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
no.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
no.
the
--
the
question
of
arrest
is
merely
an
element
which
goes
to
the
petitioner's
conduct.
good
moral
character
is
determined
by
whether
the
petitioner's
conduct
measures
up
to
the
standards
of
the
community.
it
is
his
conduct
which
is
the
criteria
and
his
arrests
are
merely
one
of
the
elements
involved
in
determining
what
his
conduct
has
been.
lawless
conduct
may
be
considered
in
determining
good
moral
character.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that
--
that
is
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that
is
true
but
of
course
since
its
conduct
which
is
being
inquired
into,
are
not
the
question
of
whether
he
has
been
convicted
even
an
acquittal
is
not
res
judicata.
there
maybe
instances
in
which
an
arrest
will
point
to
conduct
which
indicates
an
absence
of
good
moral
character
even
though
there
has
been
no
conviction.
in
other
words,
arrests
are
leads,
investigative
leads,
which
are
important
and
the
naturalization
questionnaire
the
preliminary
form
for
naturalization
in
1929
embodied
what
had
been
the
practice
and
this
question
with
respect
to
arrest
was
incorporated
at
that
time
it
has
been
there
since.
in
fact,
the
naturalization
regulations
since
1929
have
required
that
the
question
of
arrests
be
thoroughly
covered.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
read
the
pertinent
part
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
of
the
--
of
the
regulation.
as
they
were
at
the
time
of
this
petitioner's
petition
in
1940.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
no,
your
honor.
this
is
not
in
the
brief.
this
is
8
code
of
federal
regulations,
1938
edition
section
70.7.
i
shan't
read
the
entire
regulation
that
provides
in
substance
that
preliminary
examinations
of
applicants
shall
be
had
and
the
regulation
goes
on.
the
question
of
possible
arrests
must
be
thoroughly
covered.
if
the
applicant
has
been
arrested
or
charged
with
the
violation
of
any
law
or
ordinance,
all
the
facts
will
be
ascertained
including
information
as
to
whether
conviction
resulted.
in
other
words,
it
was
not
merely
the
fact
of
conviction.
it
was
the
fact
of
arrest
which
might
point
to
conduct.
i
could
give
this
court
examples
but
i'd
like
to
proceed.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
no,
i
think
the
word
including
information
as
to
whether
conviction
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
resulted
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
just
to
give
a
wholly
example,
a
man
might
be
charged
with
nonsupport.
he
might
be
acquitted
because
his
wife
would
prove
the
charges
but
yet
the
facts
that
he
didn't
support
his
wife
which
were
revealed
by
the
--
the
arrest
might
have
a
bearing
on
--
on
whether
he
is
a
person
of
good
moral
character.
i
mean,
these
examples
could
be
multiplied.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
bar
him
from
being
naturalized
or
being
it
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
well,
i
think
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
oh
i
think
--
i
think
that
--
that
the
questions
asked
should
be
relevant
to
his
eligibility
for
naturalization
and
there
are
various
eligibility
requirements,
good
moral
character
and
attachments.
and
as
i
propose
to
develop
in
the
course
of
my
argument,
those
are
ultimate
facts
which
must
be
found
but
they
depend
in
the
final
analysis
on
developing
subsidiary
facts.
for
example,
i
don't
suppose
it
can
be
expected
that
the
requirement
of
good
moral
character
would
be
established
merely
by
asking
the
petitioner,
"are
you
a
person
of
good
moral
character?
or
are
you
attached
to
the
principles
of
the
constitution?"
and
accepting
his
affirmative
response.
the
whole
history
of
the
nationality
laws
and
their
development
indicates
that
when
naturalization
was
an
ex
parte
proceeding
in
the
courts
before
the
nationality
act
of
1960
--
1906,
so
many
frauds
were
perpetrated
that
as
a
result
of
a
presidential
commission's
findings,
the
1906
act
was
enacted
with
specific
provisions
requiring
a
naturalization
examination.
the
--
the
underlying
facts
are
well-developed
in
this
court's
opinion
in
the
(inaudible)
case
and
so
i
won't
go
into
the
details.
but
in
the
1906
act,
congress
set
up
two
safeguards
against
fraud.
first
of
all,
it
set
up
a
bureau
of
naturalization
to
administer
the
act
and
it
authorized
naturalization
examiners.
this
was
section
11
of
that
act.
it
authorized
naturalization
examiners
to
appear
in
court
representing
the
government
and
to
question
the
petitioners
and
to
present
evidence
with
respect
to
the
qualifications
for
citizenship.
that
is
the
first
time
that
this
was
done.
and
then
section
15
of
the
1906
act
had
another
safeguard
against
fraud.
it
set
up
the
ancestor
of
the
present
provision
authorizing
judicial
revocation
of
naturalization
which
had
been
fraudulently
or
illegally
obtained.
in
fact,
this
court
pointed
out
at
an
early
case,
i
believe
it
was
the
nest
case
that
the
naturalization
examiners
were
the
ones
who,
by
reason
of
their
expertise,
could
best
be
relied
upon
for
determining
the
qualifications.
but
in
the
final
analysis,
the
qualifications
for
naturalization
must
depend
on
the
good
faith
of
the
petitioner.
i
am
now
arguing
a
point
that
i
had
hoped
to
reserve
till
later
but
i'll
be
very
happy
to
proceed
this
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
--
i
was
trying
to
answer
your
question
fully,
mr.
justice
black.
as
we
see
the
issues
here,
they
are
two.
first,
whether
the
affidavit
can
support
the
judgment
as
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
arrest
point.
then
the
second
question
is
whether
the
concealment
of
the
arrest
was
material
to
this
petitioner's
naturalization.
we
have
suggested
a
third
point
which
this
court
may
wish
to
consider
in
the
event
there
is
a
remand.
that
is
if
we
are
incorrect
in
our
first
two
points.
and
that
is
the
question
which
petitioner
has
raised
in
his
replied
brief
and
which
we
have
discussed
somewhat
in
our
brief
on
the
merits
as
to
whether
the
concealment
of
communist
party
membership,
even
if
adequately
proved,
was
a
material
fact
under
the
statute,
the
1940
when
petitioner
was
naturalized.
at
a
later
point
in
my
argument,
i
hope
to
discuss
that
if
time
will
permit.
we
feel
that
that
is
an
issue
which
this
court
might
wish
to
determine
since
it
is
a
legal
issue
not
dependent
on
fact
findings
and
which
would
give
guidance
to
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
event
of
remand
or
if
we
are
incorrect,
might
end
this
litigation.
i
shall
turn
now
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
yes,
sir.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that
--
that
was
one
of
the
grounds
for
denaturalization
found
by
the
court
below.
we
don't
rely
on
that
because
there
is
a
question
raised
in
our
--
as
to
the
adequacy
of
the
evidence
to
prove
that
there
was
in
fact
a
misrepresentation.
the
main
thrust
of
our
argument
is
with
respect
to
the
concealment
that
it
concealed
material
facts
with
respect
to
arrest
and
with
respect
to
communist
party
membership
both
of
which
reflected
upon
his
eligibility
to
naturalization
under
the
standards
laid
down
by
the
1906
act
under
which
he
filed
his
petition.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
no,
i
cannot
be
--
concede
that
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
--
and
on
this
basis,
if
i
may.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
at
--
at
a
later
point,
i
had
hoped
to
discuss
the
criteria
of
materiality.
we
--
we
disagree
completely
with
petitioner
as
to
what
the
proper
criteria
are
for
determining
the
materiality
of
a
misrepresentation
made
in
a
naturalization
proceeding.
and
i
should
like
to
discuss
that.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
yes,
sir.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
our
position
is
this,
that
arrests
are
of
material
inquiry
and
that
a
falsification
with
arrests
with
respect
to
arrests,
blocks
a
relevant
line
of
inquiry
at
the
time
when
the
inquiry
should
be
made.
we
cannot
tell
at
this
time
what
would
have
been
shown
by
an
investigation
conducted
in
1940,
when
it
would
have
been
conducted
had
the
facts
been
revealed.
one
thing
we
do
suggest
is
that
it
probably
would
have
disclosed
what
the
district
court
found
that
the
petitioner
at
that
time
and
in
fact
since
the
1920s
had
been
an
active
member,
an
officer,
a
full
time
functionary
of
the
communist
party.
but
we
don't'
--
we
don't
know,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
would
say
this
your
honor,
that
the
materiality
of
any
concealment
must
be
judged
in
the
context
of
the
circumstances
under
which
the
concealment
took
place.
if
that
were
all
they
are
worth
to
it,
i'm
sure
that
no
judge
would
deny
naturalization.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
but
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
the
statute
authorizes
denaturalization
for
concealment
or
misrepresentation
with
respect
to
a
material
fact.
all
arrests
are
material
facts.
they
should
be
disclosed
so
that
the
naturalization
court
which
has
the
ultimate
burden
of
judgment
should
have
them
all
before
it.
now,
our
view
is
that
when
the
government
has
established
by
requisite
evidence
that
a
clear
question
was
asked
with
respect
to
a
material
fact
such
as
arrests
and
an
answer
that
is
false
has
been
given,
and
this
answer
blocks
a
line
of
inquiry
that
is
prima
facie
material.
of
course,
it
is
open
to
the
petitioner
or
the
defendant
to
show
that
notwithstanding
this,
he
had
the
eligibility
requirements
and
that
he
would
have
been
naturalized.
but
one
never
knows
what
might
have
resulted
from
an
inquiry.
we
don't
know
to
this
day
what
a
--
an
investigation,
the
1940
with
respect
to
this
petitioner
would
have
shown.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
and
if
that
--
if
that
were
all
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
then
--
then
[laughs]
i
think
in
that
event,
it
might
--
the
arrest
itself
might
not
have
been
a
basis
for
denaturalization.
but
if
he
had
concealed
the
arrests,
willfully
that
would
reflect
on
his
good
moral
character.
this
may
be
closed
to
what
mr.
justice
potter
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
justice
--
it's
justice
stewart,
i
mean.
yes.
that
--
that
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that
is
right.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that's
right.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
--
i
probably
did
not
understand
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
surely.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
yes,
sir.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
the
lack
of
arrest
was
--
the
lack
of
attachment
was
the
non-disclosure
of
communist
party
membership
was
not
specifically
urged.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
there
was
a
--
a
specification.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that
is
right.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
nowak
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
baumgartner.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
baumgartner.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
think
that
is
so.
i
should
like
to
discuss
briefly
the
question
of
the
adequacy
of
the
affidavit.
we
suggest
in
our
brief
on
the
merits
that
this
question
has
been
abandoned
by
the
petitioner
below.
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
fact,
it
seems
to
have
been
abandoned
even
in
the
district
court
because
while
it
was
specified
in
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
original
complaint,
it
was
not
included
in
the
subsequent
motions
to
dismiss
an
amended
complaint
and
a
second
amended
complaint
based
on
the
identical
affidavit.
in
the
motions
addressed
to
those
two
subsequent
complaints,
the
petitioner
repeated
the
identical
basis
of
objection
that
were
incorporated
in
his
original
motion,
the
constitutionality
of
the
denaturalization
statute
and
res
judicata.
but
in
these
subsequent
motions,
he
did
not
repeat
the
affidavit
point.
we
feel
that
this
could
be
taken
as
an
abandonment.
and
certainly,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
mention
this
because
the
question
was
not
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals.
under
the
rules
of
the
court
of
appeals,
specificity
of
error
is
required.
we
feel
that
this
was
not
an
obvious
error
nor
was
it
an
error
which
otherwise
seriously
affects
the
integrity
or
public
reputation
of
judicial
proceedings
within
the
meaning
of
the
cases
decided
by
this
court,
where
this
court
will
notice
error
not
pointed
to
the
--
or
not
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i
should
like
to
turn
now
to
the
second
question,
and
that
is
whether
the
affidavit
is
adequate
to
support
the
judgment
on
the
basis
the
court
of
appeals
supported
it.
now,
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
(inaudible)
case
and
in
the
nowak
case
why
the
affidavit
of
good
clause
was
required.
it
was
required
to
protect
a
defendant
in
a
denaturalization
suit
against
ill-considered
or
irresponsible
governmental
action
in
instituting
such
a
proceeding.
therefore,
congress
required
that
there
should
first
be
a
screening
by,
i
believe,
mr.
justice
harlan's
opinion
in
the
nowak
case
referred
to
a
responsible
official
who
after
reviewing
the
facts
would
make
an
affidavit
setting
forth
the
evidentiary
matters
justifying
or
showing
good
cause
for
denaturalization.
i
don't
think
there's
any
quarrel
with
the
affidavit
filed
here
insofar
as
showing
good
cause
is
concerned.
it
recites
essentially
the
facts
which
were
recited
in
the
complaint
with
respect
to
the
concealment
of
the
communist
party
membership
and
the
court
below
that
is
the
district
court
found
those
facts
sustained
by
the
evidence.
but
petitioner
argues
that
that
is
not
enough,
that
the
affidavit
must,
in
effect,
contain
all
the
grounds
on
which
the
judgment
below
is
based.
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
so
and
if
i
may
draw
an
analogy,
i'd
like
to
compare
the
affidavit
of
good
cause
with
the
requirement
that
probable
cause
be
shown
under
the
fourth
amendment
to
warrant
an
arrest
or
search.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
baumgartner
case,
the
quality
of
the
evidence
or
the
standard
for
determining
the
adequacy
of
a
showing
of
probable
cause
differs
from
the
evidence
which
the
government
must
use
to
prove
a
conviction.
and
we
feel
similarly
that
the
evidence
which
must
be
shown
to
satisfy
the
statutory
mandate
that
there
be
good
cause
for
denaturalization
is
not
the
same
as
the
evidence
which
the
government
must
educe
to
prove
a
denaturalization
case.
moreover,
we
feel
that
the
petitioner
or
any
defendant
would
gain
no
meaningful
protection
from
such
a
requirement.
the
affidavit
when
executed
is
a
safeguard
against
departmental
irresponsibility
in
starting
such
a
proceeding.
the
complaint
tells
the
defendant
what
charges
he
must
defend
against.
in
combination,
they
give
him
an
adequate
safeguard.
we
don't
feel
that
congress
in
addition
to
requiring
a
showing
of
good
cause
intended
that
the
affidavit
include
everything
that
the
complaint
must
include,
such
a
reading
of
the
statute
would
make
the
affidavit
and
the
complaint
almost
identical
and
would
render
the
complaint
meaningless.
now,
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
schneiderman
case
that
it
is
to
the
complaint
that
the
defendant
must
look
to
see
what
he
must
defend
against
and
the
government
may
not
base
a
denaturalization
decree
on
a
ground
not
stated
in
the
complaint.
even
though
it
is
stated
in
the
accompanying
affidavit,
the
reverse
does
not
follow.
we
feel
that
there
is
adequate
protection
to
a
defendant
in
a
denaturalization
case
if
there
is
an
affidavit
setting
forth
one
good
cause
for
denaturalization.
we
do
not
feel
that
the
statutory
mandate
is
violated
if
instead
of
there
being
one
good
cause,
there
turned
out
to
be
two.
now,
a
petitioner
has
mentioned
the
fact
that
this
could
be
used
as
a
device
perhaps
for
alleging
one
ground
in
the
affidavit
and
then
abandoning
that
and
using
an
entirely
different
ground
in
the
district
court.
that
would
indicate
bad
faith
and
we
agree
that
there
should
be
no
bad
faith.
but
that
is
not
the
situation
here.
here,
the
affidavit
set
forth
good
cause
for
denaturalization
and
the
government
proved
that
case,
the
concealment
of
the
communist
party
membership.
in
addition,
the
government
proved
a
little
more
but
we
feel
that
taking
into
account
the
purpose
of
the
affidavit,
this
affidavit
was
adequate.
now,
i
should
like
to
discuss
the
question
of
materiality.
and
as
i
said,
we
disagree
with
petitioner
in
the
criteria
for
determining
materiality.
we
feel
that
a
misrepresentation
in
a
naturalization
case
is
material
if
there's
a
reasonable
possibility
though
not
a
certainty,
that
the
alien
would
have
been
denied
naturalization
if
the
truth
had
been
revealed.
it
must
be
remembered
that
naturalization,
although
it
is
a
judicial
proceeding
is
not
the
usual
proceeding
for
the
vindication
of
existing
rights,
rather
it
is
a
proceeding
to
have
granted
to
the
petitioning
alien
rights
which
have
not
yet
come
into
existence.
that
was
the
position
this
court
pointed
out
many
years
ago
in
manning
versus
united
states
278
united
states
17.
and
the
burden
of
proof
in
a
naturalization
proceeding
is
on
the
petitioning
alien.
any
doubt
as
to
whether
he
may
see
eligibility
requirements
must
be
resolved
against
him.
the
congress
has
laid
down
some
specific
eligibility
requirements
and
has
set
up
machinery
so
that
the
existence
of
those
requirements
can
be
ascertained.
and
as
i
pointed
out
before,
since
these
requirements
very
often
relate
to
state
of
mind,
that
is
what's
going
on
in
this
petitioner's
mind
with
respect
to
his
attitude
toward
government?
in
the
final
analysis
whether
he
has
those
requirements
depends
upon
his
good
faith
during
the
course
of
a
naturalization
examination
preceding
his
court
hearing.
this
is
underscored
by
the
fact
that
hundreds
of
thousands
of
petitions
are
filed
each
year.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
fiscal
year
1940
when
this
petition
was
filed,
some
278,000
petitions
were
filed
and
there
were
201
examiners.
naturalization
is
not
like
a
commercial
transaction
where
the
parties
may
deal
with
one
another
at
arm's
length.
the
courts
have
frequently
said
that
the
petitioner
must
deal
in
good
faith
with
the
government.
in
fact,
one
court
said
the
alien
must
deal
with
the
utmost
good
faith
toward
the
government.
now,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
materiality,
some
of
the
elements
which
congress
has
required
and
which
are
important,
such
as
attachment
to
the
principles
of
the
constitution
depend
for
their
ascertainment
on
subsidiary
facts.
attached
within
good
moral
character
are
ultimate
conclusory
facts.
but
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
naturalization
process,
the
naturalization
examiners
have
inquired
into
certain
subsidiary
facts
to
determine
the
existence
of
these
ultimate
findings.
and
as
i
pointed
out,
the
arrest
question
which
is
material
to
good
moral
character
has
been
in
the
naturalization,
regulations
and
in
the
form
itself
since
1929
even
though
arrest
questions
were
asked
even
before
that.
the
arrest
question
can
also
furnish
information
or
leads
with
respect
to
other
elements
of
naturalization.
this
was
--
we
feel
possible
right
in
this
very
case.
we
feel
for
example
if
the
petitioner
had
revealed
these
arrests
minor
though
they
may
seem
in
the
context
of
the
times
back
in
1940,
the
investigator
on
checking
and
finding
the
nature
of
the
arrests
might
very
well
have
pursued
these
leads.
it
must
be
recalled
that
in
1940,
the
war
had
broken
out
in
europe.
the
stalin-hitler
pact
was
of
recent
memory.
there
were
numerous
inquiries
into
the
extent
to
which
foreign
organizations
and
ideologies
were
--
in
all
of
the
united
states,
the
german-american
bund
was
being
inquired
into
the
communist
party
certainly.
there
were
various
legislative
inquiries
both
on
the
national
and
state
level
into
these
questions.
the
smith
act
and
other
acts,
which
seem
to
have
been
directed
at
the
communist
party,
were
enacted
in
june
27th
--
june
28th,
1940,
the
very
day
after
this
petition
was
filed.
the
--
the
question
of
membership
in
the
communist
party
was
being
inquired
into
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service,
not
only
in
connection
with
naturalization
petitions
but
also
in
connection
with
deportation
possibilities.
so
that
had
the
arrests
been
revealed,
the
investigator
or
perhaps
even
the
judge
might
have
been
led
to
inquire
--
what
were
--
what
was
the
nature
of
the
hand-bills
which
he
was
charged
with
distributing
and
whose
behalf
where
they're
being
distributed?
what
was
the
nature
of
the
oration
or
harangue
which
led
to
his
arrest,
assuming
that
--
that
there
was
such
an
oration
or
harangue?
what
was
the
nature
of
the
conduct
which
led
to
his
arrest
for
breach
of
the
peace?
all
these
might
do
without
necessarily
inquiring
or
without
the
fact
that
he
had
been
convicted
because
he
wasn't,
we
assumed.
and
in
those
days
outside
investigations
were
authorized
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
regulations.
in
other
words,
reliance
was
not
had
solely
on
the
examination
by
the
naturalization
examiner.
there
was
a
regulation
at
that
time,
i
refer
to
8
code
of
federal
regulations
1938
edition
70.9
which
required
the
district
directors
of
naturalization
to
have
naturalization
petitions
reviewed
and
further
investigations
conducted.
we
are
warranted.
and
we
feel
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
no,
sir.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
the
--
the
record
is
silent
on
that.
now,
i'm
not
saying
that
the
government's
case
necessarily
presents
on
that
with
respect
to
materiality.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
where
--
where
there
are
arrests,
the
court
is
entitled
to
know
about
them.
now
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
now,
when
the
--
when
the
inquiry
is
made,
perhaps
nothing
more
will
appear
and
the
court
will
be
satisfied
that
the
--
that
the
good
moral
character
is
shown
notwithstanding
the
arrests.
in
fact,
notwithstanding
conviction
sometimes
because
not
all
convictions
necessarily
point
to
poor
moral
characters
and
they
feel
of
the
underlying
conduct
which
is
the
important
thing.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
arrests
are
material
to
good
moral
character
and
the
time
to
investigate
is
at
the
time
the
petitioner
applies
for
naturalization
where
he
blocks
a
material
inquiry
such
as
this
by
his
misrepresentation
then
i
say
that
that
misrepresentation
is
material
to
his
naturalization.
i'd
like
to
draw
a
parallel
here
between
naturalization
and
some
of
the
other
types
of
inquiries
during
the
course
of
which
misrepresentations
are
made.
for
example,
in
the
course
of
a
judicial
inquiry
such
as
a
trial
or
a
grand
jury
inquest,
if
a
full
statement
is
made
and
that
blocks
or
torts
the
inquiry
or
has
a
tendency
to
block
the
inquiry,
the
full
statement
is
precarious.
there
need
not
be
any
showing
that
it
would
necessarily
have
altered
the
result.counsel
has
stretched
the
word
"procured"
in
the
present
statute.
we
feel
that
bad
word
does
not
have
a
significance,
counsel
attributes
to
it.
in
the
prior
statutes,
the
1906
act
and
the
nationality
act
of
1940
which
did
not
come
into
effect
until
shortly
after
this
petitioner
was
naturalized,
the
denaturalization
provision
relating
to
fraud
was
on
the
ground
of
fraud.
the
word
"procured"
was
not
used
with
respect
to
the
fraud
ground.
i
know
of
no
court
decision
stating
that
the
government
had
to
prove
that
naturalization
would
have
been
denied
had
the
truth
been
revealed.
in
fact,
it
is
my
recollection
that
the
montalbano
case
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
and
the
corrado
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
were
under
that
statute
and
they
stated
quite
the
contrary
that
if
a
relevant
line
of
inquiry
--
a
material
inquiry
to
arrest
his
blot
then
the
government
does
not
have
to
show
that
it
would
have
resulted
in
the
denial
of
naturalization.
i
believe
that
the
--
the
great
majority
of
the
circuits
which
have
considered
this
question
have
gone
along
with
that.
now,
the
--
the
legislative
history
of
the
change
does
not
indicate
that
congress
intended
any
change
in
the
standards
of
materiality.
the
1952
act
under
which
this
proceeding
was
brought
was
the
result
of
an
intensive
study
by
the
subcommittee
on
immigration
of
the
judiciary
committee
of
the
senate.
that
study
went
on
for
two
years
and
the
subcommittee
brought
out
a
report,
senate
report
1515
in
the
81st
congress,
which
analyzed
the
existing
laws
and
made
recommendations
for
changes
which
were
incorporated
in
the
new
bill
which
became
the
1952
act.
now,
the
subcommittee
analyzed
the
denaturalization
provision
and
pointed
out
that
there
had
been
a
couple
of
courts
which
had
questioned
whether
denaturalization
could
behead
for
intrinsic
fraud.
and
therefore
to
obviate
any
question,
they
recommended
the
present
language
in
order
to
make
it
a
little
more
explicit.
there
was
no
suggestion
that
the
word
"procured"
was
to
have
any
particular
significance.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
same
1952
act,
there
was
a
parallel
provision
in
the
deportation
section.
section
212
(a)
(19)
of
the
1952
act
has
a
provision
authorizing
the
exclusion
and
consequent
deportation
of
any
alien
who
has
procured
a
visa
or
other
document
by
willful
misrepresentation
of
a
material
fact.
now,
in
the
cases
which
deal
with
deportation
with
the
materiality
of
a
misrepresentation,
we
find
that
the
same
standard
for
which
we
contend
is
applied.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
(inaudible)
case
which
was
decided
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
and
affirmed
by
the
second
circuit
on
the
language
--
on
the
opinion
i
should
say
of
judge
dimmick
there
and
that
--
in
which
this
court
denied
certiorari
last
monday.
the
court
sent
forth
a
very
good
reason
for
this.
a
decision
that
an
alien
may
make
a
full
statement
in
his
application
for
a
visa,
we
could
substitute
for
naturalization.
in
order
to
avoid
the
raising
of
a
substantial
question
as
to
his
eligibility
and
then
if
he
is
caught
in
the
full
statement
after
having
successfully
trumped
off
investigation
may
try
out
his
eligibility
just
as
if
nothing
had
happened
would
it
seems
to
me
be
an
invitation
to
full
swearing.
there
are
also
additional
reasons
why
we
feel
that
the
same
standard
should
apply
with
respect
to
the
materiality
of
naturalization
falsifications
as
applied
to
the
falsifications
in
the
course
of
other
governmental
inquiries.
the
first
circuit
in
the
case
of
landen
v.
clark
stated
this
so
well
that
i'd
like
to
quote
it.
in
that
case,
the
first
circuit
reversed
the
district
court,
which
had
held
that
the
government
must
show
that
the
visa
would
have
to
be
denied
in
order
to
show
materiality.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
the
first
circuit
pointed
out
that
this
would
involve
the
courts
in
the
realm
of
conjecture
and
speculation
in
trying
to
make
a
decision
only
the
proper
authorities
could
have
capably
made.
i
see
that
my
time
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
sure.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
think
materiality
is
a
question
of
law
which
must
be
determined
in
each
case
upon
the
fact
of
the
particular
case.
i
think
it's
incumbent
on
the
government
to
prove
by
clear
convincing
an
equivocal
evidence
that
the
misrepresentation
alleged
took
place,
in
other
words
that
there
was
a
clear
question
asked
and
a
full
statement
given
and
that
--
that
misrepresentation
blocked.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
think
that
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
think
that
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
sure.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
think
--
i
think
that
--
that
prima
facie
is
materiality.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
think
so.
i
think
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
person
who
has
misrepresented
should
come
forward
and
show
if
he
can
that
notwithstanding
his
misrepresentation,
he
still
possess
the
eligibility
requirements
for
naturalization
and
that
might
be
that
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
oh,
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
these
questions
can
be
determined
in
a
vacuum.
i
think
all
the
circumstances
must
be
taken
into
account.
i
think
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case
among
the
evidence
before
this
court,
that
--
that
suppression
was
material
and
as
i
said
before
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that's
right.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
exactly.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
exactly,
that
is
a
nutshell.
i'm
not
sure
i
didn't
express
it
that
way
but
that
--
that
is
so.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
purely
theoretically.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
yes.
i
--
i
can
say
that
no
denaturalization
proceeding
would
be
instituted
if
that
were
the
only
fact.
the
government
does
not
institute
these
proceedings
merely
because
a
prima
facie
case
can
be
made
up.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
yes,
and
willful
full
statement.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
we'd
--
we'd
want
to
know
of
course
won't
the
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that's
right.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
but
a
willful
full
statement
might
always
conceal
something
else.
it
--
it
might
lead
to
other
things
which
could
show
that
it
should
be
denaturalized.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
per
se
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
with
respect
to
materiality?
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
yes,
yes.
then
i
think
the
burden
is
on
the
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
no.
i
don't
think
materiality
is
eliminated
because
the
door
is
always
open
to
the
defendant
to
come
in
and
show
that
actually
notwithstanding
this
parking
ticket
or
these
other
arrests.
he,
in
fact,
had
the
qualifications
and
could
have
been
admitted.
but
that
of
course
depends
upon
the
nature
of
the
inquiry
in
the
naturalization
court
and
that
is
where
the
inquiry
should
be
made.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
think
so.
i
think
if
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
no,
i
would
not
suggest
that,
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
that
the
government
has
the
burden
of
showing
materiality
but
that
materiality
is
a
--
a
legal
conclusion
which
depends
upon
all
the
facts
of
the
case.
if
the
misstatement
blocks
or
chokes
off
or
torts
a
relevant
line
of
inquiry,
then
it
is
prima
facie
material.
but
i
think
that
that
door
is
open
to
the
defendant
to
come
in
and
show
something
else.
and
on
the
sum
of
all
the
evidence,
after
it
is
all
in,
the
denaturalization
court
might
conclude
that
this
prima
facie
case
of
materiality
has
been
thrown
out.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
think
that
impeding
the
court
with
respect
to
any
relevant
item
which
the
court
has
a
right
to
inquire
into
and
itself
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
in
itself
is
material
as
a
prima
facie
matter.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
sure.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
think
its
decision
was
based
on
the
issue
presented
and
that
is
whether
the
findings
of
the
district
court
were
adequate
to
sustain
the
conclusion
that
there
was
a
material
misrepresentation
with
respect
to
arrest.
that
was
the
sole
basis
of
decision.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
no.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
no.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
no.
judge
maris
adhered
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
that
--
that
in
a
nutshell
is
the
decision
of
the
court.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
don't
think
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
i
don't
think
it
does.
there
have
been
some
decisions
where
the
district
courts
have
said,
well,
it's
true
that
this
happened
many
years
ago
but
the
government
hasn't
shown
that
in
recent
years
he's
been
have
poor
moral
character.
in
fact,
all
the
evidences
to
the
contrary
if
he
were
petitioning
today,
he
could
probably
show
eligibility.
there'd
be
no
point
in
denaturalizing.
i
may
add
that
that
is
one
of
the
criteria
which
the
department
considers
before
it
authorizes
a
suit.
there
was
no
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
naturalization
is
a
judgment.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
oh,
i
think
--
i
think
he
could
have.
the
--
the
defendant
in
this
case
wouldn't
take
the
stand.
he
--
he
made
no
--
he
made
no
showing
whatsoever.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
oh,
perhaps
--
perhaps
i
misunderstood
the
import
of
--
of
your
question
mr.
justice
black.
i
--
i
was
confiding
myself
--
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
said
i
recall
the
right
folder,
i
recall
some
--
i
don't
believe
that
they
are
reported.
i
--
i
am
merely
calling
upon
my
experience
in
this
field.
mr.
maurice
a.
roberts
yes.
i'm
--
i'm
not
so
sure
that
there
are
even
unreported
opinions.
if
--
if
i
can
find
that,
i
think
i'd
be
very
happy
to
submit
them.
