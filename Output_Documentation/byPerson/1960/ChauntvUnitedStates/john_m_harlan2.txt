john
m.
harlan
was
there
--
was
there
a
specific
question
in
communist
party
membership?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
couldn't
find
it
in
the
questionnaire.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
just
want
to
check.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
difference
between
this
questionnaire
and
the
ones
that
that
were
involved
nowhere
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
court
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
court
did
--
didn't
reached
that
but
it's
the
same
questionnaire.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
we
had
no
such
issues
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question,
is
there
any
issue
before
us
as
to
whether
or
not,
with
a
lack
of
time,
otherwise
this
man
was
in
good
faith.
good
faith,
forgotten
about
these
arrests,
is
there
any
issue
of
that
claim?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
not
arguing
that
obviously.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
--
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
it's
incumbent
on
the
government
to
make
any
showing
materiality?
justice
john
m.
harlan
let
me
put
my
question
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
that
the
government
makes
out
a
case
simply
by
showing
that
an
arrest
question
was
asked
--
answered
falsely?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
that
make
your
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
the
nature
--
the
nature
of
the
crime
for
which
the
arrest
took
place
by
the
crime
which
the
arrest
took
place,
the
nature
would
be
other
evidence
as
to
possible
grounds
of
deport
--
deportability
or
denaturalization
would
make
no
difference.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
then
you're
really
standing
on
a
per
se
rule
of
materiality
sort
of
come
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
once
you've
shown
in
a
full
statement,
a
willful
full
statement
which
is
where
this
record
must
be
taken
here.
that's
enough
to
make
out
your
prima
facie
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
they
discuss
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
on
the
communist
party
finding?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
you
describe
that?
i
would
say
a
sort
of
standard.
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
you
say
