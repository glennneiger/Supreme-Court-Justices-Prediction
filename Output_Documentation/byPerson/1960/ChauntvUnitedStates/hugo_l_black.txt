raised
if

on

in
the
defense

was
it
the
defense
that
the
immigration

did
not
ask
the
communist
questions?
justice

black
did
you
raise
in
the
court
of
appeals
the
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
nor
in
the
petition
either?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
wonder
if
your
second
complaint
was
attack
on
the
grounds
of
the
failure
to
allege
in
the
affidavit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
of
course
if
(inaudible)
there's
a
real
substantial
question
raised
as
to
whether
the
man
was
in
convicted
without
enough
evidence.
we
would
have
authority
would
you
not
under
the
statute
which
gives
us
the
right,
suppose
to
the
case
that
justice
may
require.
justice
hugo
l.
black
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
pass
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
insisting
its
claim
of
privilege?
justice
hugo
l.

has
he
been
convicted
of
an
anything,

what

what

what

black
inspection
of
the

i
haven't
yet
seen
yet.
which
one
are
you
relying
on
for
the
right
to
answer
that
question
and
claim
that
the
amounts
for
a
reason
to
deny
a
naturalization?
what
statute

statutory
statute?
justice

so
which
part

quoted

read
the
part

the

an
argument
read.
justice

what
is
the
united

code

justice

black
there's
no
contest
about
that?
justice

what
is
the
section
that's
authorized
as
the
department
to
ask
questions
which
are
not
legitimate
grounds
in
themselves
for
denying
accusations?
that
was
i
was
asking.
i'm
--
i'm
not
familiar
with
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
there
anything
in
it
that
indicates
that
the
mere
arrest
of
the
man?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
denying
the
right
to
naturalization?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
any
circumstances?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
makes
the
arrest?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
that
you
wouldn't
claim
that
an
arrest
necessarily
shows
that
he
didn't
have
good
moral
character
justice
hugo

black
as
far
as
(inaudible)
justice

black
--
just
what
the
basis
of
--
justice
hugo

--
this
is?
justice
hugo

could
i
be
presumed

as

regulation.
justice

is
that
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume,
i
don't
suppose
they're
challenging
you
but
i
presume
you
would
agree
that
the
mere
fact
if
they
have
a
right
to
ask
you
various
questions
in
connection
with
denaturalization
doesn't
mean
that
such
a
severe
thing
to
be
done
if
they
can
say,
just
take
up
any
little
statement
he
makes
to
prove
to
be
not
correct
to
bar
him
from
being
naturalized.
justice
hugo

to
authorize
his
denaturalization.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
there
are
some
bounds
or
limits
to
where
they
can
search
around
and
ask
questions
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
no,
you
go
ahead.
go
on,
it's
part
of
my
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
eliminating
materiality
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
materiality
by
that,
do
you
not
or
does
it
--
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
is
that
he
could
show
that
it
was
not
material.
they
couldn't
revoke
his
citizenship?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
what
you're
saying
in
effect
fact
is
that
the
burden
is
not
on
the
government
to
reach
necessary
allegation
on
all
this
charge
and
all
this
particular
institution
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you're
saying
in
effect,
as
i
see
it
is
that
--
and
maybe
you're
right
here
that
impede
the
court
infatuated,
it
may
keep
it
from
getting
evidence.
it
could
use
to
prove

genuine
ground
of
denaturalization

suppose,
the
court
--
i'm
just
asking
of
curiosity.
i
don't
know
whether
it's
ever
been
raised
and
not
eventually
yesterday.
suppose
this
denaturalization

that
says
that
i
am
satisfied
that
he
blocked

investigation
at

might
have
been
able
to
show
if
they
had
a
bad
character
but
didn't
show
it.
the
case
is
still
here.
i
can
revoke
the
judgment
in
his
favor
but
i'm
going
on
with
it
and
to
see
whether
or
not
he's
entitled
to
become

that
ever
occur?
justice

i'm
not
sure
it
occurred.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
was
rather
claim
as
i
see
it.
the
reason
i
asked
the
question,
i
suppose
that
the
--
thing
that
he's
charged
with
here
based
to
this
judgment,
is
that
he
made
a
false
statement
about
--
statement
about
arrest
and
then
that
would
not
have
been
enough
--
those
arrests
would
not
have
been
enough
alone.
it
did
not
to
take
citizenship
away.
i
understand
you
to
put
it
on
the
basis.
attempt
might
show
a
bad
character
but
that's
one
on
the
other
ground.
is
there
any
question
to
ask
whether
that
action
since
it
was
not
enough
to
bar
him
that
this
might
be
simply
setting
aside
the
judgment
that
was
rendered
it
is
a
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
setting
aside
the
judgment
and
that
left
the
matter
to
be
determined,
is
to
what
had
happened
(inaudible)
and
the
man
could
insist
that
even
with
that
there
was
not
enough
to
denaturalized?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
going
on,
on
the
basis
that
they
are
not
here
and
that
they
might
be
decided
in
the
other
man's
burden.
that's
right.
