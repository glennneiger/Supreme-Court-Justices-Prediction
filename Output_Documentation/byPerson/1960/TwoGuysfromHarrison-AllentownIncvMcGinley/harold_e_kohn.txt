mr.
harold
e.
kohn
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
feel
most
unfortunate
that
i
waited
a
long,
long
time
for
the
opportunity
of
coming
before
this
court.
i
find
the
two-case
in
which
i'm
going
to
argue,
the
arguments
are
anticipated.
yesterday,
the
argument
i
intended
to
present
on
monday,
the
antitrust
case
was
anticipated
and
today
mr.
berger
i
think
began
the
argument
of
my
case
sometime
before
i
got
here.
so
that
i
may
have
to
digress
for
a
moment
from
the
argument
that
i
had
intended
to
give
and
clear
what
i
think
it
has
to
be
cleared
by
way
of
the
record
before
we
begin
here.
in
the
first
place,
in
our
case
which
was
begun
before
the
1959
act
was
passed,
we
challenge
the
old
1794
act
which
had
become
a
part
of
the
criminal
code
when
all
of
pennsylvania
criminal
laws
were
codified
in
1939.
the
attorney
general,
in
his
brief,
at
page
3
is
quite
clear
on
that
and
says
that
there
are
two
statutes
involved
here
-
one,
the
old
1794
act
and
the
other
the
1959
act.
now,
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
the
old
statute
is
still
there.
i
may
say
this
too
sir
that,
we
had
evidence
in
our
case
partly
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
amateur
theologian
on
this
side
of
the
bar
from
giving
you
what
might
not
be
actually
the
correct
theology.
and
let
me
perhaps
explain
just
what
sunday
and
what
saturday
is
and
to
remind
you
what
sometimes
people
do
forget.
it's
once
again,
like
the
burner
that
justice
frankfurter
was
interested
in
seeing
yesterday.
saturday
began
as
a
religious
day
of
rest
in
the
old
testament.
you
have
it
of
course
first
write
in
genesis
at
the
very
beginning
and
then
very
emphatically
incorporated
as
part
of
the
biblical
law
in
the
ten
commandments
and
elsewhere
throughout
the
old
testament.
sunday
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
that
concept.
sunday
and
saturday,
insofar
as
the
quarrel
is
concerned
or
the
theological
dispute,
is
not
a
quarrel
as
to
which
is
the
day
of
rest.
in
other
words,
is
the
seventh
day
of
the
week
saturday
or
is
the
seventh
day
of
the
week
sunday,
and
this
is
all
in
the
evidence
which
was
produced
below
and
not
challenged
by
any
contradictory
evidence
on
the
part
of
a
commonwealth
and
by
no
witness
on
the
other
side.
about
300
years
after
the
resurrection
when
there
had
become
a
number
of
christian
communities
which
sprang
from
the
roman
or
the
gentile
or
pagan
origin
as
distinguished
from
those
which
sprung
from
jewish
origin
and
after
constantine
and
the
story
we're
all
familiar
with
when
in
this
sign
he
conquered
and
decided
that
he
was
going
to
make
christianity
the
state
religion.
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
pass
a
law
which
made
sunday,
this
was
in
320,
sunday,
which
had
been
forever
--
and
has
been
since
forever
commemorated
as
the
day
of
the
resurrection
not
the
day
of
rest,
a
holy
day
and
a
state
enforced
holy
day.
now,
what
did
he
do
in
order
to
make
it
enforce
as
a
state
holy
day.
he
took
from
the
jewish
religion
with
which
people
were
familiar
that
form
of
observance
which
traditionally
and
now
for
4,000
years,
i
mean
it's
in
the
blood
and
the
bone
as
a
method
of
celebrating
a
religious
event.
he
took
that
which
was
the
most
solemn
way
of
observing
a
religious
holy
day
refraining
from
work.
traditionally,
among
the
jewish
people,
that
sabbath
was
the
holy
day.
in
yom
kippur,
which
is
for
all
jews
who
have
any
religious
observance
at
all
the
most
sacred
day
of
the
year,
the
most
important
injunction
even
more
important
actually
than
fasting
is
the
refraining
from
work,
and
we
quote
in
our
brief
the
admonitions
in
the
bible
that
not
only
must
i
refrain
of
my
man
servant,
my
maid
servant,
the
people
in
my
house
and
even
the
animals
are
forbidden
to
work
on
that
day
in
the
jewish
community.
so
that
you
had
a
combination
really
of
two
things
-
you
had
the
enforcement
of
the
pivotal
doctrine
in
the
christian
religion,
namely,
the
resurrection
observed
by
state
compulsion
through
that
which
traditionally
among
the
jewish
people
have
been
the
way
of
showing
the
greatest
respect,
namely,
refraining
from
work.
i
read
justice
holmes
who
said
that
page
of
history
i
think
is
worth
the
volume
of
logic
and
you
just
can't
throw
out
of
the
window
as
the
city
solicitor
sought
to
do
some
4,000
years
of
jewish
history
and
some
1,600
years
of
christian
and
western
history.
judge
hastie
in
his
opinion
below
recognized
that
all
of
our
sunday
laws
are
part
and
parcel
of
the
same
thing.
our
expert
witness
has
said
pretty
much
along
the
line,
i
think
mr.
justice
black
mentioned
yesterday,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
form
of
words
you
put
it
in,
when
you
tell
people
they
cannot
work
on
sunday
in
the
judeo-christian
civilization
in
which
we
live,
they
know,
if
they
give
any
heat
to
the
matter,
that
you
are
enforcing
respect
for
a
religious
doctrine.
now,
that
we
think
is
forbidden
regardless
of
whether
you
approach
it
through
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
point
of
view
or
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
black's
point
of
view,
because
whether
it
be
the
first
amendment
incorporated
into
the
fourteenth
or
whether
it
be
those
fundamental
liberties
with
which
we
are
so
much
concerned
which
are
guaranteed
to
us
by
the
fourteenth,
the
answer
comes
out
the
same
way.
you
have
the
enforcement
of
a
religious
doctrine
by
the
state.
now,
judge
hastie,
when
he
discussed
this
matter
in
the
court
below,
and
if
you
refer
to
my
brief,
it
runs
through
from
pages
9
to
12
where
he
made
a
number
of
findings
which
were
never
challenged,
there
was
no
countervailing
evidence
whatsoever,
pointed
out
very
clearly
what
kind
of
day
sunday
is.
at
page
10,
for
example,
“sunday
is
the
day
designated
for
religious
services
and
observances
by
christian
and
so
on.”
he
pointed
out
that
sunday
work,
so
far
as
health,
rest,
etcetera
are
concerned,
is
no
different
as
work
from
work
on
any
other
day.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
commonwealth
conceded
it.
in
our
case
there
was
an
express
admission
of
that
in
the
pleadings
and
at
the
hearing
and
the
judge
may
define
and
dictated
by
the
--
by
the
record.
i
must
say,
as
i
say,
these
are
findings
of
fact.
now,
in
the
next
sentence
or
the
next
paragraph
on
page
10,
the
judge
there
did
what
i
think
anybody
must
do
comes
to
an
examination
of
the
subject.
he
considered
all
of
the
pennsylvania
statutes
together
and
pointed
out
how
there
were
a
number
of
exceptions
to
the
original
1794
act
which
have
carved
out
a
piece
here
and
carved
out
a
piece
there,
quite
obviously,
because
they
were
not
interested
in
keeping
sunday
the
day
of
rest
but
in
keeping
sunday
as
a
symbolic
day
of
devotion
to
the
doctrines
of
a
christian
religion,
and
you
can
preserve
the
symbol
even
though
you
erode
from
it
many
of
the
practical
work
a
day
aspect
as
long
as
you
keep
as
i
say
the
symbol.
now,
there
are
times
when
keeping
the
symbol
does
affect
people
adversely
either
practically
or
in
their
liberty
or
in
their
pocketbook
as
it
does
in
the
case
of
the
two
guys
from
allentown,
which
is
the
store
that
we
represent
in
this
case.
he
also
points
out
it
in
the
finding
of
facts
which
i
quote
on
page
12
that
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
has
enacted
a
pattern
of
economic
laws
under
the
police
power
which
regulate
hours
of
work
which
operate
completely
independently
of
the
sunday
laws.
now,
once
again,
our
employees
are
unionized.
they
don't
work
more
than
six
days
a
week.
if
john
wanamaker
had
decided
that
it
is
going
to
fight
tooth
and
nail,
the
union
which
wants
to
have
a
six-day
week
and
they
are
not
unionized,
you
don't
get
round
that
very
practical
economic
problem
by
this
kind
of
sunday
legislation.
you
can
have
all
of
these
sunday
statutes
enforced
to
the
hill
and
they
are
enforced
and
i
think
that's
one
of
the
vices
of
the
sunday
legislation
quite
spasmodically
and
irregular
--
irregularly
and
for
sometimes
not
very
fine
or
noble
purposes.
you
could
enforce
it
to
the
hill
and
you
wouldn't
keep
people
from
working
seven
days
a
week.
does
the
man
can
work
in
a
covered
occupation
six
days
and
then
go
to
the
exempted
occupation
on
the
seventh?
now,
if
you
want
to
keep
people
from
working
seven
days
a
week,
you
can
do
it
so
very
easily
by
simply
providing
in
a
statute
that
they
cannot
work
seven
consecutive
days
and
that
statute
is
very
easily
enforceable.
we
all
know
that
the
40-hour-week
for
example
is
very,
very
rigidly
enforced
and
if
you
can
force
--
if
you
can
enforce
a
law
which
permits
a
man
to
work
six
hours
in
one
day,
eight
hours
another
day,
10
hours
at
third,
three
hours
the
next
as
long
as
they
don't
add
up
to
more
than
40
hours
at
a
week,
you
can
certainly
enforce
this
kind
of
law,
which
says
that
a
man
cannot
work
for
12
consecutive
hours
or
24
consecutive
hours.
i
don't
think
it's
any
problem
on
that
score
at
all,
and
even
if
there
were,
i
think
it's
entirely
different
from
saying
that
because
of
that
administrative
problem
you
can
pass
legislation
which
has
this,
i
think,
very
important
symbolic
content
for
our
society
as
a
whole.
and
i
think
even
a
christian
could
come
in
and
complain
about
a
law
which
compel
him
to
refrain
from
work
on
sunday
or
to
go
to
church
on
sunday
even
if
seventh
day
sabbatarians
and
everybody
else
were
accepted,
and
i
know
that
the
seventh
day,
the
men
feel
very
strongly
about
that
and
they
would
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
in
all
--
beside
i
think
that
is
correct,
and
i
think
in
answer
to
--
i
think
it
was
a
question
asked
by
justice
whittaker
and
i
think
justice
harlan,
i
would
say
you
have
to
go
even
--
it's
not
necessary
in
our
case.
but
i
think
we
do
have
a
very
basic
constitutional
issue
here
which
i
think
should
be
discussed
by
counsel
frankly
and
candidly.
i
would
say
you
can
pick
no
day.
if
you're
going
to
pick
a
fixed
day
which
will
accomplish
the
purpose
constitutionally
that
the
proponents
of
sunday
legislation
say
they
have
in
mind.
if
you
pick
sunday,
then
you
have
the
people,
quite
sincere
people
like
the
braunfeld
plaintiffs
and
crown
kosher
plaintiffs
coming
in
and
saying,
“well,
yes
maybe
it
doesn't
hurt
me
very
much
but
it
does
hurt
me.”
and
there's
no
reason
why
they
should
be
hurt
if
the
purpose
can
be
accomplished
otherwise.
if
you
pick
saturday,
the
christians
have
a
perfect
right
to
complain.
if
you
pick
any
other
day
in
the
week,
then
anybody
who
must
observe
by
his
dictates
of
his
own
religion,
saturday
or
sunday
has
every
reason
to
complain,
and
there's
no
necessity
for
picking
any
particular
day.
you
can
pick,
you
can
do
just
what
i
said,
you
can
do
with
regard
to
24
consecutive
hours
off
which
is
more
recently
enforced
than
our
real
labor
legislation.
we
have
several
of
those
laws
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
absolutely
sir.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
well,
first
of
all
most
of
us
work
for
other
people
and
just
as
you
can
provide
and
do
provide
that
you
cannot
work
a
man
for
40
hours
a
week
without
paying
him
overtime
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
the
same
--
may
i
suggest
sir
that
the
same
records
which
show
how
many
hours
a
week
a
man
has
work
will
show
whether
he
has
worked
24
consecutive
hours
or
not,
it's
the
very
same
record.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
that's
right.
well
that
--
that
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
unfortunately
sir,
and
i
regret
it
more
than
any
by
enlarge
most
of
us
are
coming
to
work
for
other
people
whether
in
business
or
in
government
or
in
the
many
other
activities.
now,
i
would
say
this
that
if
what
you
are
saying
is
that
we
don't
know
whether
a
man
works
24
hours
consecutively
on
a
particular
day
in
the
week,
how
in
the
world
can
anybody
ever
enforce
the
1794
sunday
law
which
prevents
me
as
a
lawyer
actually
from
working
on
a
brief
in
this
case.
i'm
sure
all
of
us
in
pennsylvania
--
mr.
berger
and
i
have
worked
together
on
many
sundays
in
many
matters.
and
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
it's
precisely
sir
because
the
great
bulk
of
the
population
do
i
say
and
the
reason
for
which
they
--
i
said
that
the
law
which
compel
them
not
to
work
on
sunday
is
unconstitutional.
now
i
think
you
put
your
finger
on
the
very
practical
answer.
take
me
for
example,
i
wouldn't
work
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
i
wouldn't
work
--
i
wouldn't
work
on
sunday
except
that
much
more
arduous
labor
which
i've
been
confronted
with
in
the
last
several
sundays
writing
leaves,
but
i
think
a
person
who
was
compelled
to
do
what
he
would
do
voluntarily
has
a
right
to
complain.
i
think
in
our
pluralistic
society,
people
resent
and
resent
very
--
i
think
somebody
quite
humorously
said
about
the
child
in
the
progressive
school,
do
we
have
to
do
what
we
want
today.
and
i
think
it's
true.
i
would
resent
a
law.
i'm
not
too
devowed
but
i
would
resent
a
law
which
compelled
me
to
go
to
the
synagogue
on
yom
kippur.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
no
law
which
protects
me
on
yom
kippur
and
i
manage
to
do
quite
well,
and
i
am
sure
that
the
christians
in
a
predominantly
christian
community
would
have
no
trouble
enforcing
the
dignity
and
respect
to
which
the
sabbath
in
their
minds
their
sabbath
is
entitled
without
the
compulsion
of
this
law.
and
we
know
as
a
practical
fact
that
they
get
along
quite
well
despite
the
fact
that
these
laws
have
not
been
enforced
in
pennsylvania
in
many
places
for
quite
sometime.
i
think,
sir,
that
you're
countering
up
something
which
doesn't
exist
when
you
point
to
the
empower,
argue
the
impossibility
of
enforcing
that
kind
of
law.
it's
as
easily
enforced
as
the
law
which
forbids
motion
picture
operators
to
work
more
than
six
days
a
week,
and
as
so
far
as
i
know
no
violations
of
that
law
of
any
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
i
don't
think
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
it
would
spontaneously
enforce
itself
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
the
difficulty
of
enforcement
is
not
this
whole
test.
i
say
that
the
great
bulk
of
the
people
would
be
subject
to
enforcement
in
the
same
way
to
the
40-hour
we
did
enforce.
now,
as
to
the
other
people,
you
can
no
more
enforce
the
sunday
law
against
them
bearing
in
mind
that
the
sunday
law
in
pennsylvania
doesn't
only
mean
there's
a
law
that
we
heard
about
before
the
1959
act
but
the
1794
act
is
what
--
take
for
example
that
the
very
situation
mr.
berger
gave
you.
the
jewish
merchant
who
is
prohibited
from
doing
something
on
sunday
by
way
of
selling
but
can
take
inventory.
well,
if
he
takes
inventory
on
sunday
behind
his
own
close
doors,
he
is
violating
the
1794
act
which
is
still
in
effect
the
important
points
with
my
sunday
laws.
now,
how
do
you
enforce
that
against
any
more
than
you
enforce
a
law
where
it
says
he's
not
supposed
to
work
and
we
know
that
the
sabbath
jews,
if
this
record
is
correct,
and
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
it
does
not,
are
already
actually
observing
one
day
a
week.
they
are
not
working
on
sundays.
that's
why
in
that
particular
case
they
happened
to
come
here.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
well
that's
why
you
are
here,
if
may
i
say
so,
to
guide
them
when
their
views
are
on
questions
of
administration
transgress
constitutional
right.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
well,
that
was
a
gentle
word
and
i
think
you
have
[laughter]
--
that
describes
the
power
which
you
have
over
it.
if
you
approach
this
problem
with
the
same
clear
level
gauge
that
you
approach
when
i
think
is
a
similar
problem,
the
question
of
racial
discrimination,
this
is
a
question
of
religious
right,
i
think
there'll
be
no
problem.
i
mean,
i
think
this
kind
of
case
that's
into
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
it
must
be
approached
in
precisely
the
same
--
the
same
way.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
and
we
think
sir
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
well,
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
i
think
they
might
sir
and
there
are
many
cases
i
think
that
could
be
illustrated.
suppose
for
example,
i
ran
a
boxing
arena
and
the
law
of
louisiana
forbid
negroes
and
whites
to
box
together
and
that
caused
me
to
have
to
give
up
a
particular
match
which
i
would
like
to
have
scheduled
there.
i
then
suffer
a
monetary
damage
as
a
result
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
i
think
i
can
complain.
suppose
i
have
a
restaurant
in
which
i
want
to
have
negroes
and
white
persons
to
eat
together,
and
a
policeman
says,
“if
you
admit
this
negro
to
your
restaurant
who's
patronage
i
want,
i
will
arrest
you”
which
is
what
they
say
here,
if
you
sell
on
sunday,
i
will
arrest
you.
i
think
i
certainly
have
a
right
to
bring
that
matter
before
the
court.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
no,
they
are
not.
but
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
no.
they
raised
the
issue
for
themselves
in
the
same
way
that
the
sisters
of
mercy
in
the
pierce
case
and
the
hill
academy
in
the
pierce
case
raised
the
issue,
because
of
a
law
which
the
legislature
has
no
power
to
enact
under
the
constitution,
namely,
a
law
which
dignifies,
tends
to
establish,
sets
out
a
religion
or
a
religious
pass,
aid
to
religion.
i
am
hurting
my
pocketbook
that
under
many
decisions,
the
pierce
case
is
one
which
suggests
itself
immediately
to
me,
has
been
held
to
give
us
the
standing
to
come
in
and
complain.
and
i
think
there's
been
no
challenge
to
that
at
least
in
our
case
for
quite
some
time
now
since
we
got
before
the
three-judge
court.
now,
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
personally,
i
think
not,
because
i
think
that
grave
and
serious
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
that's
right.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
that's
right.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
i
think
there,
you'd
run
afoul
the
religious
problem.
i
think
you'd
run
afoul
as
to
whether
there
is
in
any
reasonable
purpose
which
is
served
by
such
a
law
within
the
competency
of
the
legislature
to
adopt
and
whether
that
--
which
maybe
a
very
severe
penalty
and
that
would
have
become
a
question
probably
of
fact
in
which
evidence
would
have
to
be
introduced
in
that
case
as
it
was
in
our
case
here,
whether
in
such
a
situation
the
remedy
is
too
harsh.
this
is
for
example
in
some
of
your
free
speech
cases,
you
held
that
in
an
effort
to
prevent
the
sale
of
obscene
literature
to
children,
you
can't
prohibit
the
sale
of
obscene
literature
generally.
in
an
effort
to
get
at
people
like
mr.
smith
out
in
california
in
a
case
you
decided
recently,
you
don't
want
to
discourage
people
from
selling
anything
which
is
on
the
doubtful
borderline
so
therefore,
you
must
lay
down
as
part
of
the
statutory
test
that
he
must
have
knowledge.
in
other
words,
these
are
very
practical
problems
and
you
have
to
consider
the
laws
in
the
context
in
which
they
arise,
but
i
do
say
this
that
this
particular
sunday
law
in
pennsylvania
with
the
overtones
that
it
had
had
since
1682,
and
the
commonwealth's
own
brief
draws
the
history
of
the
legislation
over
several
pages,
and
they
point
out
quite
clearly
that
the
first
law
which
i
think
even
uses
words
like
in
order
to
preserve
the
sabbath
of
the
primitive
christians
and
to
get
people
time
and
to
encourage
them
to
go
to
church
and
so
on
and
it's
just
routine
stock.
it
goes
right
down
for
250
years,
300
years
almost,
right
down
to
the
present
day.
so
i
think
in
that
context,
this
law
is
certainly
--
is
certainly
bad.
i
think
the
other
is
a
much
nicer
problem.
i
think
though
it's
the
kind
of
law
that
our
legislature
would
never
adopt.
the
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
no.
the
1959
law
was
put
before
the
legislature
with
a
great
religious
overtone.
i
have
here
the
transcript.
that
at
one
page,
the
chief
proponent
of
the
people
whom
you
heard
so
much
about
the
day,
the
department
stores,
said
that
when
the
vast
majority
of
the
people,
it's
department
store,
i
mean,
it's
not
a
(inaudible),
when
the
vast
majority
of
the
people
out
of
10
or
11
million
people
in
this
state,
probably
90%
of
them
are
of
a
christian
faith
and
one
sunday
is
a
holiday,
the
religious
holiday,
i
am
one
who
wants
them
to
keep
that
sunday
which
is
their
religious
holiday
and
day
of
rest.
so
that
i
think
we
can
manage
if
the
things
were
met
on
an
economic
issue,
but
it's
when
in
the
guys
of
a
religion
that
they
seek
to
do
something
like
this
that
you
can't
meet
in
the
legislature.
if
the
other
problem
comes
up,
i
think
we
have
entirely
different
situation.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
no
and
i
don't
think
it
cures
the
constitutional
defect
because
i
have
some
misgivings
myself
as
to
whether
if
you
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
just
pure
sabbatarian?
of
course
there
are
many
people
who
work
in
our
store,
many
of
our
customers
who
are
not
seventh-day
sabbatarians,
who
still
want
to
buy
on
sunday.
that
day,
as
to
them,
the
day
that
they
choose
to
go
out
and
shop
with
their
family.
there's
so
many
of
them
do
it.
it's
a
very
convenient
method
for
them,
and
it's
very
convenient
for
people
who
work
in
our
store
and
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
yes.
there
are
many
things
that
we
do
as
i
said
before
voluntarily,
and
in
our
civilization
which
is
good
we
do
voluntarily
which
you
cannot
compel
me
to
do.
it
might
be
a
desire,
really,
it
might
be
a
wonderful
thing
if
everybody
went
to
church
someday
or
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
that's
right.
certainly.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
that's
right.
but
when
the
reason
you
are
compelled
to
do
is
a
religious
reason
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
--
then
it
does
transgress
the
constitution.
it's
a
good
thing
to
be
vaccinated.
just
take
the
vaccination
case
for
example
which
i
think
poses
the
other
argument.
i
would
vaccinate
my
children
whether
i
required
by
law
to
do
so.
and
there
maybe
people
who
oppose
vaccination
on
religious
grounds,
but
vaccination
is
not
required
by
the
state
because
it
is
a
religious
ceremony.
it's
required
by
the
state
because
it's
a
health
measure.
and
i
think
you
yourself,
sir,
have
said
that
you
have
to
be
more
careful
about
the
restraints
you
put
on
the
mind
than
those
on
the
belly.
and
i
think
even
more
you
have
to
be
careful
about
the
restraints
you
put
on
the
spirit
than
those
you
put
on
the
mind,
than
those
you
put
on
the
belly.
so
they
can
compel
me
to
get
vaccinated
and
they
can
even
compel
somebody
who
opposes
vaccination
on
a
religious
ground,
but
here
you
have
no
public
purpose
to
serve
really
except
the
dignity
of
the
religion
and
the
religious
doctrine
which
sunday
has
traditionally
celebrated.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
that's
right.
i
did
want
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal,
sir,
so
i'll
close
at
this
time.
we'll
come
back
for
five
minutes
later.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
despite
that
constitutional
provisions
just
been
read
by
the
attorney
general,
it
was
from
pennsylvania
that
there
came
the
murdock
case
in
which
this
court
established
for
the
first
time
i
think
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
did
protect
this
kind
of
liberty.
now,
a
word
about
classification.
now,
i
haven't
argued
it,
probably
because
i
haven't
had
time.
now,
i
do
ask
the
court
to
believe
that
we
do
have
a
very
serious
argument
there.
we
could
regale
you
for
15
or
20
minutes
with
the
very
picture
as
the
example
chosen
from
the
statute.
the
two
lower
court
opinion
that
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
to
do
i
think
set
forth
in
just
a
few
pages
very
vividly
a
kind
of
wholly
capricious
and
irrational
distinctions
drawn,
whether
you
consider
this
as
a
religious
statute
or
whether
you
consider
it
as
a
statute
designed
to
enforce
a
day
of
rest
or
to
close
up
this
kind
of
--
no
matter
how
you
look
at
it,
it's
a
rational
from
every
standpoint.
now
judge
hastie,
immediately
after
the
portion
that
the
attorney
general
read
to
you,
did
say
that
there
is
testimony
which
establishes
the
fact
in
this
record
that
this
view
of
the
religious
significance
enforce
sunday
work
stoppage
is
sincerely
held
by
many
person
whose
religion
does
not
recognize
the
divinity
or
resurrection
of
jesus
or
the
sacredness
of
sunday
as
the
lord's
day.
and
then
he
did
proceed
to
make
the
findings
which
we
quote
at
pages
10
to
12
of
our
brief
and
he
did
say
in
another
case,
the
companion
case
which
we
quote
on
page
28
of
our
brief
that
were
not
for
the
freedman
case,
this
would
be
in
his
opinion
a
very
different
situation.
so,
it
wasn't
because
judge
hastie
thought
the
facts
were
against
this,
he
felt
confined
by
the
freedman
case,
and
i
think
it's
clear,
i
mean
the
judge
--
being
the
judge
he
is
that
when
he
made
all
these
findings
and
said
in
the
bargaintown
case
that
this
was
a
case
of
first
impression,
the
constitutionality
would
not
be
free
from
doubt.
it
is
quite
evident
what
he
meant
when
he
made
those
findings
and
quite
evident
why
he
made
the
findings.
and
i
think
it's
clear
from
those
findings
and
from
the
evidence
in
this
case
that
to
borrow
a
word
from
mr.
justice
frankfurter
yesterday
that
there
appears
to
be
here
a
great
legislative
preoccupation
with
religion,
whether
you
consider
the
types
of
exemptions
that
people
exempt
anything
else,
these
laws
one
thing
stand
out
from
the
preoccupation
with
religion.
on
the
day,
--
the
one
day
in
seven,
i
did
want
to
invite
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
civil
liberty
union
which
i
think
very
forcefully,
very
vividly,
points
out
that
the
so-called
problems
of
administration
are
really
de
minimis
and
we
have
laws
like
that
in
pennsylvania
ourselves
which
we
have
no
difficulty
enforcing,
many
other
states
do
too.
finally
i
invite
you
to
the
amicus
brief
filed
in
the
companion
cases
by
the
synagogue's
counsel
which
does
purport
and
which
does,
i
think,
represent
the
orthodox,
the
conservative,
and
the
jewish
point
of
view
with
regard
to
the
statutes,
and
very
clearly
i
think
confirms
the
expert
witness
testimony
under
oath
which
i
think
were
the
good
deal
more
than
anybody
as
i
say
standing
here
telling
you
is
the
jewish
is
not
the
jewish
point
of
view.
thank
you
sir.
