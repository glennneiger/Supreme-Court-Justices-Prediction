mr.
kohn,
as
i
understand
it,
it's
your
suggestion
that
the
--
all
of
your
constitutional
difficulties
could
be
--
would
be
resolved
if
pennsylvania
were
to
enact
the
statute
of
the
one-day
in
seven
variety,
providing
that
in
any
seven
day
period,
everybody
should
have
a
consecutive
24
hours
of
rest.
would
you
--
would
you
concede
that
the
pennsylvania
legislature
would
have
power
to
provide
that
one-day
in
seven
all
retail
stores
should
be
closed?
justice
potter
stewart
because
under
your
first
theory,
as
i
understand
it,
your
clients
could
operate
24
hours
a
day,
seven
days
a
week
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
so
long
as
they
arrange
their
employment's
schedule
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
so
as
not
to
employ
anybody
more
than
six
consecutive
days.

but
it's
not
unlike
the
1959
law.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
kind
of
curious
about
one
thing;
it's
hardly
worth
taking
much
time.
i
suppose
pennsylvania's
background
is
the
background
of
quakers
the
society
of
friends,
and
we've
been
told
earlier
here
today
that
to
the
society
of
friends
sunday
isn't
to
have
any
particular
--
that
each
day
of
the
week
is
equally
holdings.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
just
--
out
of
curiosity
wanted
if
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
two
lower
court
of
pennsylvania
decisions
recent
ones
don't
involve
this
plaintiff,
do
they?
justice
potter
stewart
the
ones
holding
invalid
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
one
was
a
criminal
case
and
the
other
was
an
equity
case.
