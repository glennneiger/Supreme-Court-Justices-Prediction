do
you
think
--
do
you
think
mr.
kohn
if
you
really
--
i'm
not
sure
if
i
follow
you.
are
you
suggesting
that
it
should
be
left
to
the
individual
discretion
which
24
hours
you
intimate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
how
is
that
enforceable
if
it's
left
to
the
free
willing
unless
you
attribute
much
more
than
i
do
spontaneous
obedience
of
individual
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we've
had
intricate
machinery
of
record
and
so
on
by
which
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
the
fair
labor
standard
act
applies
to
people
who
are
employed
by
others.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
think
of
the
--
think
of
the
diversity
of
activity
as
the
reconciled
entity
by
all
of
citizens
of
pennsylvania.
i
don't
know
how
many
hundreds
of
thousands
running
into
millions
don't
work
for
anybody,
where
there
are
no
record.
they
work
for
themselves,
for
their
private
scholars,
or
private
accountants
or
what
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
started
out
with
a
great
bulk
of
the
population
assenting
to
non-work
on
sunday
whereas
under
your
scheme
you
start
out
with
no
such
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
truly
not
to
represented
example.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
the
law
isn't
directed
against
your
kind.
it
is
directed
against
people
who
underline
your
respect
for
abstention
in
yom
kippur,
in
fact
our
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
the
interdependent
--
do
you
think
there
is
such
uniformity
or
comprehensiveness
in
collective
activity
in
our
day
that
anybody
as
a
different
group
picking
different
day,
they're
all
the
interdependent
of
industry
and
the
professions
or
whatever
you
call
calling,
that
that
would
just
spontaneously
enforce
it
though
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
the
(inaudible)
has
a
lot
complaint
enforcing
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
even
--
even
--
moderately
as
impossibly
enforce
itself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
you
--
suppose
you
were
right,
suppose
you
can
--
you're
demonstrably
right
or
persuasively
right
and
might
be
many
people
in
the
pennsylvania
legislature
who
might
have
the
same
narrow
view
about
enforceability
that
i
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
nice
view
from
us
to
--
whatever
you
used
to
guide
them.
i
didn't
know
that
was
my
job.
justice
felix
frankfurter
helpfully
under
racial
problem,
i
have
a
specific
provision
of
the
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
not
think
i
have
a
specific
provision
dealing
with
your
problem
else
we
wouldn't
have
had
five
hours
or
six
hours
of
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
sunday
have
some
non-judicial
--
non-religious
significance.
you
say,
they
like
to
shop
on
sundays,
so
sunday,
there
must
be
something
--
why
sunday
for
them
having
no
religious
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
other
way
around
is
also
true.
there
are
many
things
which
the
legislature
can
compel
to
doing
even
though
a
lot
of
people
would
do
them
anyhow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
fact
that
--
the
fact
that
you
--
as
i
say
you,
neither
of
those
general
statements
helps
us
in
this
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
heart
of
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
vidal
--
the
vidal
case
was
not
a
dehydrated
theology,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
by
a
very
learned
man.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
--
you
just
said
it's
the
holy
day?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
their
concern,
but
not
the
state's
concern.
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
are
through
characters
--
as
an
expression
of
state,
it
isn't
the
holy
day.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you're
saying
that,
then
you're
in
great
trouble.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
a
famous
jew
had
something
to
do
with
revolution
in
pennsylvania?
does
the
famous
jew
had
something
to
do
with
the
revolution
in
pennsylvania?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
a
particular
one.
