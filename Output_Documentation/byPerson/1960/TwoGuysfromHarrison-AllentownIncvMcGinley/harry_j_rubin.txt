mr.
harry
j.
rubin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
still
seems
to
be
some
question
about
the
exact
nature
of
the
rights
of
this
plaintiff
to
raise
a
question
in
this
case.
i
want
to
obviate
any
question
on
that
point
right
now.
this
plaintiff
is
a
corporation.
it
pleads
no
personal
or
religious
infringement
and
at
no
point
in
the
case
has
the
issue
of
interference
with
the
exercise
of
a
religion
been
involved.
but
as
a
corporate
plaintiff
being
forced
to
remain
closed
on
sunday,
it
has
suffered
economic
detriment
and
we
have
agreed
that
it
has
standing
to
raise
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
this
sunday
law
is
a
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion.
if
we
say
that
that's
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
if
it
affects
the
basic
freedoms
that
are
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
it
is
important
to
remember
that
this
plaintiff
simply
wants
to
remain
open
seven
days
a
week.
the
record
is
clear
that
it
closes,
if
allowed
to
remain
free
to
do
as
it
pleases,
that
it
closes
only
on
four
days
of
the
entire
year,
new
years
day,
fourth
of
july,
christmas
day
and
easter
sunday.
and
apart
from
that,
this
plaintiff
wants
to
remain
open
all
of
the
time.
i
think
that
it's
impossible
to
discuss
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
pennsylvanian
sunday
law
violates
the
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
the
nature
that
we've
describe
without
looking
at
history.
not
only
the
history
that
mr.
kohn's
discussed,
that
is,
what
was
the
original
intent
of
sunday
observance
at
the
time
of
constantine,
but
also
pennsylvania
history.
what
do
we
have
in
pennsylvania?
i
think
we're
all
familiar
with
the
fact
that
pennsylvania
was
founded
under
a
royal
charter
given
to
william
penn.
when
william
penn
drafted
the
first
frame
of
his
government
in
1682,
he
included
as
article
22
of
that
frame
a
provision
that
said
the
first
day
of
the
week
shall
not
be
used
for
ordinary
business.
it
was
a
very
brief
provision.
there
was
also
enacted
shortly
thereafter
several
of
the
laws
in
england
that
applied
to
the
new
pennsylvania
colony
when
the
colonist
came
here
immediately
thereafter
and
that
dealt
with
a
sunday
law
very
much
like
the
1939
codification
that
we
have
before
us
to
the
effect
that
every
first
day
of
the
week
called
the
lord's
day,
people
shall
abstain
from
their
common
daily
labor.
this
provision
of
the
original
laws
of
pennsylvania
and
found
in
the
first
frame
of
government
in
1682
was
carried
through
several
successive
laws
over
the
next
112
years,
the
pennsylvania
history.
until
in
the
act
of
1794,
that
was
promulgated
by
the
general
assembly
of
pennsylvania
enact
very
much
like
the
present
provisions
that
we
find
in
the
1939
penal
code
section
699.4.
this
being
so,
how
can
we
explain
pennsylvania's
devotion
to
religious
freedom
which
is
as
much
a
part
of
the
history
of
the
founding
of
pennsylvania
as
the
fact
that
we
had
established
churches
in
other
colonies
as
part
of
the
history
of
those
colonies.
pennsylvania
never
had
an
established
church.
william
penn
expressly
provided
for
religious
freedom
in
pennsylvania.
at
no
time,
where
these
tenants
violated
from
the
day
it
was
founded
until
today
and
i
refer
for
example
to
the
first
constitution
of
pennsylvania
enacted
after
the
founding
of
the
federal
system
of
government
in
this
country
under
the
federal
constitution
of
1789.
that
constitution,
the
constitution
of
1790,
expressly
provided
that
all
men
shall
have
freedom
to
worship
or
not
to
worship
as
they
please
and
that
the
state
shall
give
no
preferment
to
any
religion.
this
being
so
is
it
possible
to
say
that
this
sunday
law
is
a
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion.
in
the
braunfeld
case,
which
you
heard
earlier
today,
justice
frankfurter
mentioned
the
virginia
bill
for
religious
liberty.
that
bill,
the
outcome
of
large
scale
passionate
efforts
by
madison
and
jefferson
was
enacted
in
1785.
it
was
followed
one
year
later
in
the
virginia
legislature
by
a
reenactment
of
the
virginia
sunday
law.
now,
virginia
certainly
knew,
having
disestablished
its
church
a
year
previous,
what
establishment
meant
and
what
laws
violating
religious
freedom
meant,
and
yet
history
shows
us
in
virginia
as
well
as
pennsylvania
that
these
sunday
laws
formed
an
integral
part
of
the
community
and
the
social
fabric
of
the
laws
of
that
state.
secondly,
let
us
take
the
reference
made
by
the
plaintiffs
here
to
various
expressions
in
opinions
of
the
pennsylvania
courts.
they
cite
a
quotation
in
updergraph
against
the
commonwealth,
an
1824
decision
of
our
supreme
court
to
the
effect
that
christianity
is
part
of
the
common
law
of
pennsylvania.
on
its
face,
it's
hard
to
explain
that
statement,
but
if
you
look
at
the
paragraph
in
which
that
statement
appears,
i
think
you
get
a
completely
different
view.
i'd
like
to
quote
it,
“christianity,
general
christianity,
is
and
always
has
been
part
of
the
common
law
of
pennsylvania.
christianity
without
the
spiritual
artillery
of
european
countries;
for
this
christianity
was
one
of
the
considerations
of
the
royal
charter,
and
the
very
basis
of
its
great
founder
william
penn.
not
christianity
founded
on
any
particular
religious
tenets;
not
christianity
within
established
church
and
tithes
in
spiritual
courts,
but
christianity
with
liberty
of
conscience
for
all
men.”
even
this
court
has
had
occasion
to
refer
to
that
statement
and
to
the
updergraph
case.
in
the
famous
case
of
vidal
against
girard's
executors,
handed
down
by
this
court
in
1844,
you
said,
“it
is
also
said
and
truly
that
the
christian
religion
is
part
of
the
common
law
of
pennsylvania,
but
this
proposition
is
to
be
received
with
its
appropriate
qualifications
and
in
connection
with
the
bill
of
rights
of
that
state
as
found
in
its
constitution
of
government.”
then
quoting
the
provisions
from
the
constitution
that
you
went
on
to
say
“language
more
comprehensive
for
the
complete
protection
of
every
variety
of
religious
opinion
could
scarcely
be
used
and
it
must
have
been
intended
to
extend
equally
to
all
sex
whether
they
believe
in
christianity
or
not
and
whether
they
were
jews
or
infidels
so
that
we
are
compelled
to
admit
that
although
christianity
be
part
of
the
common
law
of
the
state,
yet
it
is
so
in
this
qualified
sense
that
is
divine
origin
and
truth
are
admitted,
and
therefore,
it
is
not
to
be
maliciously
and
openly
reviled
blasphemed
against
to
the
annoyance
of
the
believers
or
the
injury
of
the
public.”
it's
interesting
to
note
that
the
updegraph
case
itself
was
simply
a
case
involving
a
conviction
for
blasphemy,
the
very
thing
that
the
supreme
court
in
the
vidal
case
refers
to.
so
i
say
--
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
well,
it
wasn't
written
by
a
theologian,
as
best
i
know.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
it's
my
feeling
and
it's
our
position
that
the
history
of
the
pennsylvania
sunday
laws
cannot
be
isolated
from
the
history
of
pennsylvania
generally.
and
any
looking,
any
view
of
the
history
of
the
pennsylvania
certainly
convinces
anyone
that
this
colony
founded
on
principles
of
religious
freedom
tolerating
the
greatest
variety
of
religious
and
nonreligious
exercises.
it
cannot
be
said
in
the
passage
of
these
sunday
laws
since
1682
to
have
violated
any
of
the
restrictions
placed
upon
the
states
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
until
i
heard
that
today,
i
never
realized
such
a
thing
was
true.
i
had
always
thought
from
my
understanding
of
pennsylvania
history
that
sunday
was
being
the
christian
day,
the
holy
day
for
quakers
as
well
as
any
other
christian
sect.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
i
have
no
other
information
on
that
respect.
with
this
--
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
well,
it
was
the
day
of
observance.
it
was
the
day
in
which
the
quaker
would
go
to
church
just
as
a
methodist
would
go
to
church.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
that's
right.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
no,
we
don't
--
and
certainly
we
don't
claim
it
is.
we
say
--
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
we
say
that
all
that
the
sunday
laws
probably
were
designed
to
do
in
pennsylvania
when
you
put
them
into
this
historical
matrix
is
simply
to
see
to
it
the
people
who
came
to
pennsylvania
had
an
opportunity
to
enjoy
the
freedoms
pennsylvania
offered.
now,
it's
certainly
true
that
in
1682
for
most
of
the
historical
references
i
can
find,
there
were
either
no
jews
in
pennsylvania
or
very,
very
few
jews
in
pennsylvania.
i
think
no
jews
is
probably
correct.
the
first
jews
came
to
pennsylvania
in
the
early
1700s.
but
by
1794
when
the
last
act
was
passed,
the
one
that
forms
the
basis
for
the
1939
penal
code,
there
was
a
large
community
of
jews
in
pennsylvania
particularly
in
philadelphia
to
lancaster.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
i
believe
there
was.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
i
think
there
are
probably
were
several.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
in
this
background,
i
want
to
then
refer
to
several
things
that
the
plaintiff
here
has
referred
to
in
his
paper
books.
eight
times
in
the
paper
books
filed
by
the
plaintiff,
and
i
include
the
jurisdictional
statement,
the
brief
in
our
position
to
the
motion
to
affirm,
the
brief
on
the
merits
and
the
reply
brief.
the
plaintiff
has
said
or
implied
very
directly
that
the
court
below
made
explicit
findings
of
fact
that
sunday
laws
are
religious
in
origin
purpose
and
defect.
i'd
like
to
examine
just
what
the
court
below
did
say.
the
references
which
the
plaintiffs
made
or
to
the
portions
of
the
record
on
pages
280,
281,
286
and
290
to
292;
on
page
280,
in
the
paragraph
beginning
shortly
before
the
bottom
of
the
--
middle
of
the
page,
right
after
middle
of
the
page,
judge
hastie
said,
“we
think
it
cannot
be
seriously
questioned
that
in
their
relation
to
the
first
day,
sabbath
has
an
institution
of
christianity.
the
new
york
and
pennsylvania
statutes
have
a
common
background
and
were,
in
original
conception,
designed
to
the
same
end.”
i
would
say,
i
think
fairly
that
all
judge
hastie
was
pointing
to
it
at
that
point
was
that
historically
religious
considerations
of
some
nature
played
a
part
in
the
passage
of
sunday
laws.
he
repeats
very
much
the
same
thing
on
page
281
where
he
says,
“the
historical
religious
connection
is
clear
on
both
state
statutes
as
to
be
obvious
and
indisputable.”
i
might
add
that
what
he
was
doing
here
was
comparing
the
freedman
case
which
you
heard
so
much
about
with
the
present
situation
in
pennsylvania.
over
on
page
286,
of
course,
the
only
reference
as
to
the
fact
that
he
mentions
that
the
factual
statement
shall
constitute
the
findings
of
fact.
and
on
page
290,
we
find
supplementary
findings
of
fact
of
which
number
one
refers
to
the
nature
of
sunday
as
a
day
designated
for
religious
observance
by
christians
except
for
the
seventh
day
believers.
no
question
is
made
that
in
historical
origin
religious
problems
played
a
part
in
the
enactment
of
these
laws
but
the
plaintiffs
have
gone
on
to
say
that
in
purpose
and
effect,
present
purpose
and
present
effect,
if
you
please,
in
their
brief
on
the
merits,
judge
hastie
found
as
a
fact
that
these
were
religious
laws.
i
say
that
the
plaintiffs
are
wrong
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
whatsoever
that
would
enable
us
to
say
judge
hastie
made
such
a
finding.
furthermore,
they
go
further
on
page
17
of
their
brief,
in
the
last
paragraph
they
state.
“it
seems
equally
clear
that
the
findings
of
the
court
below
that”,
and
now
quoting
the
court
below,
“the
required
sensation
of
business
on
sunday
is
an
enforced
expression
of
respect
for
and
acknowledgment
of
the
sacred
character
in
religious
symbolism
of
the
christian
sabbath,
a
religious
institution
commemorating
the
resurrection
of
christ”,
then
referring
to
page
276
of
the
record.
if
such
a
finding
of
fact
were
made
by
the
court
below,
i
think
i
would
be
in
very
dark
trouble
at
this
point.
but
let's
look
at
page
276
of
the
record.
here's
what
judge
hastie
says
in
the
middle
paragraph,
“plaintiff
attacks
the
pennsylvania
legislation
commanding
the
cessation
of
certain
worldly
activity
on
sunday.
the
state
action
promoting
an
establishment
of
religion
contrary
to
the
prohibition
of
the
first
amendment
is
made
applicable
to
the
states
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
argument
is
that
this
required
cessation
of
business
on
sunday
is
an
enforced
expression
of
respect
for
an
acknowledgement
of
the
sacred
character
and
religious
symbolism
of
the
christian
sabbath,
a
religious
institution
commemorating
the
resurrection
of
christ.”
i
failed
to
find
any
finding
of
fact
by
judge
hastie
that
this
is
what
sunday
is
today.
i
only
find
an
expression
by
judge
hastie
that
this
is
what
the
plaintiffs
are
arguing
and
yet
in
their
brief
on
the
merits,
the
plaintiff
flatly
state
that
this
is
a
finding
of
fact
made
by
judge
hastie.
i
might
add
that
he
goes
on
to
say
that
there
are
many
persons
who
sincerely
believe
that
this
is
what
sunday
is
meant
to
do
in
the
modern
world.
but
i
also
say
that
that
is
hardly
of
finding
of
fact
by
the
court
that
bears
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
legislation.
it
simply
his
view
that
certain
persons
feel
that
these
sunday
observances
infringe
their
personal
beliefs.
it's
not
a
constitutional
determination.
going
on
to
some
of
the
other
arguments
that
are
raised
by
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
beyond
the
religious
one,
and
i
reemphasize
that
the
only
religious
argument
is
the
one
that
you
would
call
the
establishment
question.
they
also
raise
questions
of
whether
or
not
the
laws
violate
--
these
two
laws
violate
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
as
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
quite
apart
from
any
religious
issue.
their
argument
basically
centers
on
the
1959
statute
because
that
is
the
statute
that
says
you
cannot
sell
at
retail
certain
specified
commodities
and
those
are
the
commodities
which
this
plaintiff
wants
to
sell
on
sunday
and
every
other
day
of
the
week.
i
find
that
the
answer
to
this
problem
can
be
best
expressed
not
by
me
but
simply
by
what
judge
hastie
said.
in
his
decision
that
judge
hastie
found,
and
this
appears
on
page
284
of
the
record,
which
is
part
of
his
opinion,
that
the
circumstances
attending
or
existing
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
this
1959
act
affirmatively
suggest
a
rational
basis
for
the
legislative
action.
if
this
is
so,
and
he
goes
on
to
explain
what
he
means,
if
this
is
so,
i
find
it
very
difficult
for
the
plaintiffs
now
to
say
that
judge
hastie's
findings
of
the
facts
supporting
the
promulgation
of
that
legislation
can
be
disregarded
by
them
but
they
can
accuse
us
to
disregarding
explicit
findings
which
judge
hastie,
they
say
made,
which
he
didn't
make.
it's
our
view
that
the
legislative
background
of
the
1959
act
is
so
clear
in
judge
hastie's
opinion
and
it's
so
apparent
that
it's
hard
to
say
that
there's
any
violation
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
we
must
assume
that
if
you
can
think
of
any
rational
basis
for
the
enactment
of
this
law,
it
must
be
upheld.
we're
not
here
to
decide
whether
we
would
agree
with
that
legislature
or
whether
we
would,
as
members
of
the
legislature,
have
voted
for
the
law.
we're
only
here
to
determine
if
that
legislature
have
the
power
constitutionally
to
enact
it.
judge
hastie
felt
without
question
they
did
and
he
found
that
the
circumstances
justify
this.
furthermore,
this
court
has
held
several
times
that
the
burden
is
placed
upon
any
plaintiff
who
was
seeking
to
strike
down
a
law
on
this
basis
is
great
indeed.
in
the
lindsley
case,
which
we
refer
to
on
page
48
of
our
brief,
the
rules
are
set
forth.
i
know
of
no
case
which
has
ever
deviated
from
these
rules
or
said
they
no
longer
apply.
plaintiff
has
not
even
begun
to
meet
the
burden
placed
on
them
in
that
respect.
the
plaintiffs
raised
other
attacks
on
the
law,
their
attacks
which
they
haven't
mentioned
in
the
oral
argument
and
which
they
haven't
spent
much
or
any
time
at
all
in
their
brief.
one
deals
with
whether
or
not
defines
in
the
act
are
oppressive.
i'll
follow
the
plaintiff's
lead
and
not
speak
too
much
to
that
myself.
it's
covered
in
the
brief
on
pages
53
and
54.
i
think
the
law
is
very
clear
that
this
is
pretty
basically
a
matter
of
legislative
concern
and
most
defines
are
so
great
that
this
court
can
say,
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
they
are
absolutely
oppressive
and
in
fact
in
some
cases,
this
court
has
said
they
have
to
be
so
great
as
to
oppress
the
plaintiff
not
to
contest
them
with
penalties
that
would
be
imposed.
that
certainly
isn't
the
case
here.
i
want
also
to
discuss
a
final
point
which
the
plaintiffs
have
not
discussed
in
their
oral
argument,
but
most
of
the
record
is
taken
up
with
the
problem
raised
by
this
question
and
that
is
the
question
that's
not
in
any
of
the
other
cases.
did
the
district
attorney
of
lehigh
county
enforce
these
laws
in
the
discriminatory
fashion?
this
is
quite
a
part,
of
course,
from
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
laws
themselves.
in
answering
that
question,
i
think
a
preliminary
question
has
to
be
answered.
the
district
attorney
of
lehigh
county,
at
the
time
these
laws
were
being
enforced
and
at
the
time
this
case
arose,
was
paul
mcginley.
you
will
note
in
the
title
to
the
case
that
the
appellees,
the
defendants,
are
paul
mcginley,
district
attorney
county
of
lehigh,
pennsylvania
and
george
j.
joseph,
district
attorney
county
of
lehigh,
pennsylvania
substituted
additional
defendant.
what
happened
was
this.
mr.
mcginley's
term
of
office
as
district
attorney
terminated
on
january
4
of
this
year.
he
had
served
in
that
office
in
accordance
with
the
statutes
of
pennsylvania
for
four
years.
mr.
joseph
succeeded
him
having
been
duly
elected
the
preceding
november.
when
plaintiffs
here
presented
a
motion
to
the
court
below
to
substitute
mr.
joseph
in
the
case
and
i
will
take
full
blame
for
the
technical
nicety
that
was
overlooked
here.
a
motion
asked
that
he
be
substituted
as
a
substituted
additional
defendant
not
that
he
be
substituted
in
place
of
mr.
mcginley.
first,
i
find
nothing
in
the
federal
rules
that
allow
such
a
procedure.
rule
25
(d)
expressly
discusses
the
problem
of
substitution
of
the
public
officer
and
it
points
out
that
you
can
do
so
in
order
to
preserve
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
being
enforced
by
that
officer.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
for
several
reasons,
this
phase
of
the
case,
discriminatory
enforcement,
is
no
longer
before
the
court.
first
of
all,
if
you
didn't
have
rule
25
(d)
at
all
would
be
thrown
back
on
the
old
decisions
of
this
court
that
say
such
an
action
would
abate
when
the
public
officer
leaves
office.
second,
rule
25
(d)
being
present.
we
have
nothing
in
the
rule
as
i
pointed
out
that
allows
the
retention
of
a
former
public
officer
when
the
only
issue
relates
to
a
discriminatory
enforcement
of
the
statute.
third,
even
if
we
stretch
the
rule
to
try
to
cover
this
case,
the
rule
says
you
have
to
have
an
allegation
that
whatever
you're
alleging
is
invalid
will
continue.
and
in
this
case,
the
plaintiffs
in
their
motion
alleged
that
the
new
district
attorney
will
not
continue
this
pattern
of
enforcement.
fourth,
and
it's
a
very
technical
point,
i'd
never
heard
of
a
substituted
additional
defendant
except
when
you
have
third
party
practice
involved,
joinders.
and
finally
and
i
think
most
important
is
this,
in
this
case
the
plaintiffs
are
seeking
equitable
relief.
they
want
an
injunction.
as
the
first
ground
for
seeking
that
injunction
they
alleged
the
invalidity
of
the
statute
itself.
they
base
that
invalidity
on
the
grounds
we've
discussed,
religious
nature
of
the
statute
and
second,
the
violation
of
equal
protection.
second,
passed
that
point
they
say,
they
asked
for
an
injunction
on
the
ground
that
district
attorney
mcginley
enforced
the
statute
in
an
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
fashion.
they
seek
no
monetary
damages
from
mr.
mcginley
or
his
actions
as
district
attorney.
what
this
means
is
that
the
plaintiffs
here
are
asking
the
court
to
pass
upon
a
question
of
enforcement
and
obtain
an
injunction
against
the
public
official
who
is
no
longer
a
public
official.
since
mr.
mcginley
is
no
longer
district
attorney,
he
can't
enforce
the
statute
and
an
injunction
against
him
would
be
meaningless.
it
would
simply
be
an
advisory
opinion.
it
would
be
a
moot
act.
it
would
have
no
significance
whatsoever.
third,
under
the
1959
statute
as
judge
hastie
found,
mr.
mcginley
never
had
an
opportunity
to
enforce
that
the
act
was
passed
subsequent
to
the
institution
of
this
case
and
at
the
time
when
mr.
mcginley
was
under
restraint
issued
by
the
three-judge
court.
so
in
every
respect
that
i
can
think
of,
there's
no
grounds
whatsoever
for
going
into
the
entire
question
at
all
of
whether
or
not
there
was
discriminatory
enforcement.
the
plaintiffs
haven't
answered
any
of
these
arguments
in
their
reply
brief.
all
they
have
is
one
statement
in
their
brief
itself,
which
says
the
court
really
should
consider
this
question
because
down
in
lehigh
county,
before
several
justices
of
the
peace,
there
are
still
some
pending
criminal
summary
criminal
cases
which
were
brought
against
employees
of
the
defendant.
i
think
that
the
answers
to
this
are,
first,
that
this
record
doesn't
raise
any
of
those
questions
on
the
criminal
prosecutions,
and
second,
any
defense
on
this
ground
which
they
may
be
allowed
to
raise
can
be
raise
simply
in
those
criminal
prosecutions.
it
doesn't
affect
this
plaintiff.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
no,
i
don't
believe
they
do.
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
they
involve
other
plaintiffs
i
think
some
in
similar
position
of
the
same
natures
as
the
operation
may
be,
it's
similar
--
mr.
harry
j.
rubin
one
was
an
equity
case
and
one
was
a
criminal
case.
i'm
told
by
the
city
solicitor
of
philadelphia
that
the
equity
case
is
still
pending
on
exceptions
and
that
the
criminal
case,
the
district
attorney
for
various
reasons
concerning
the
record
didn't
feel
that
he
should
appeal
and
it
remains
in
that
posture.
as
far
as
the
question
of
discriminatory
enforcement
goes
on
the
merits,
we
have
covered
that
extensively
in
the
brief
in
case
the
court
wishes
to
look
at
it.
as
i
say,
the
record
itself
is,
for
the
large
part,
taken
up
with
testimony
on
the
nature
of
the
enforcement
in
lehigh
county
and
doesn't
deal
with
the
statute
itself.
i
will
close
with
just
one
final
reference.
pennsylvania
presently
operates
under
a
constitution
written
in
1874.
this
constitution
was
preceded
by
a
constitution
written
in
1838
and
that,
in
turn,
was
preceded
by
a
1790
constitution.
there
was
even
one
before
that
but
of
course
the
1790
constitution
was
the
first
one
which
was
promulgated
in
pennsylvania
after
the
united
states
constitution
and
after
the
statehood
achievement
of
pennsylvania.
in
the
1873
constitution
and
in
the
1838
constitution,
there
is
repeated,
almost
verbatim
with
no
significant
change,
if
any,
the
language
of
that
constitution
of
1790
which
i
have
referred
to.
i'd
like
to
read
it
because
i
think
it
was
applicable
to
pennsylvania
in
1790
before
the
passage
of
this
1794
act
and
it's
still
applicable
in
pennsylvania.
article
9
section
3
states
that
“all
men
have
a
natural
and
indefeasible
right
to
worship
almighty
god
according
to
the
dictates
of
their
own
consciences,
that
no
man
can
of
right
be
compelled
to
attend,
erect,
or
support
any
place
of
worship
or
to
maintain
any
ministry
against
his
consent,
that
no
human
authority
can,
in
any
case
whatever,
control
or
interfere
with
the
rights
of
conscience,
and
that
no
preferment
shall
ever
be
given
by
law
to
any
religious
establishments
or
modes
of
worship.”
thank
you.
