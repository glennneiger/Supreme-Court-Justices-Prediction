mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
the
respondent's
attempt
to
establish
a
principle
which
could
subject
the
united
states
to
an
enormous
liability,
this
principle
is
based
on
the
theory
that
the
insurer
of
a
mortgage
who
has
appraised
for
insurance
purposes
the
property
constituting
the
security
for
the
mortgage,
is
liable
to
a
purchaser
of
that
property,
unknown
at
the
time
of
the
appraisal,
for
the
difference
between
the
purchase
price
and
the
fair
market
value
of
the
property.
the
cases
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fourth
circuit,
which
is
in
effect
to
establish
that
principle
by
affirming
the
trial
court.
now,
the
facts
in
the
case
are
simply
stated
under
the
--
to
take
advantage
of
the
national
housing
act,
one
who
intends
to
sell
a
house
that
is
eligible
for
fha
mortgage
insurance,
they
generally
do
some
work
quickly,
if
he
knows
the
amount
for
which
the
fha
would
appraise
his
house
in
the
maximum
amount,
up
to
which,
it
will
insure
any
mortgage
on
the
house.
to
obtain
this
information,
he
must
have
a
financial
institution
approved
by
the
fha
as
a
mortgagee.
make
an
application
to
the
fha
for
a
so-called,
"conditional
commitment."
when
the
fha
receives
such
an
application,
it
sends
an
appraiser
to
appraise
the
property
to
determine
whether
it
meets
the
standards
of
eligibility
and
to
fix
evaluation
for
insurance
purposes.
if
the
property
is
found
eligible,
the
commissioner
in
this
so-called,
conditional
commitment,
to
insure
mortgage
on
the
house,
is
bound
to
insure
it
an
amount
computed
on
the
appraised
value
of
the
property,
subject
to
the
condition
that
the
mortgagor
when
he
comes
along
is
found
financially
able
to
carry
the
mortgage.
now,
upon
issuing
the
conditional
commitment
to
a
proposed
mortgagee,
the
commissioner
also
issues
a
separate
document
entitled,
statement
of
fha
appraisal,
which
sets
forth
the
written
--
the
appraised
value
of
the
property
as
determined
by
the
commissioner.
and
under
the
statute,
the
seller
is
bound
to
deliver
a
copy
of
this
appraisal
to
the
buyer
prior
to
the
sale.
in
the
case
at
bar,
colonel
almquist
in
march
of
1957,
followed
the
procedure
i
have
mentioned
above
and
had
an
approved
institution,
make
application
for
a
conditional
commitment.
in
following
the
procedure,
an
appraiser
was
sent
out
to
his
house,
by
some
time
prior
to
march
14th
of
that
year.
now,
on
march
14th,
mr.
stanley
neustadt,
the
respondent
here,
the
plaintiff
below,
was
a
washington
lawyer,
was
looking
for
a
house
and
he
and
his
wife
looked
at
colonel
almquist's
house,
after
the
appraiser
had
made
his
inspection.
mr.
neustadt,
the
--
the
house
suited
mr.
and
mrs.
neustadt
and
they
considered
the
possibility
of
hiring
someone
to
inspect
the
house,
but
it
was
his
understanding
that
the
fha
appraisal
would
disclose
any
matters
of
structural
defects
or
matters
as
to
which
he
had
any
concern.
he
was
informed
as
to
that,
by
his
real
estate
agent
and
that
was
his
understanding.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
sir?
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
no,
sir.
the
record
didn't
show
whether
he
was.
it
--
he
doesn't
have
to
be
a
veteran.
he
is
the
prospective
buyer
of
the
house.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
that's
correct.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
that
the
appraisal
would
reveal
a
--
a
structural
defect?
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yes,
sir.
he
was.
if
the
--
under
their
rules
and
regulations,
if
the
appraiser
notes
a
serious
structural
defect,
he
will
make
his
appraisal
subject
to
this
defect
and
note
it.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
the
--
mr.
neustadt
then
made
an
offer
on
this
house
for
the
sum
of
$24,500.
the
offer
was
conditioned,
expressly
conditioned
on
receiving
an
appraisal
in
that
same
amount,
an
fha
appraisal
of
$24,500.
the
appraiser
who
had
been
out
there
and
now
made
his
report
and
he
reported
that
the
house
was
worth
only
$22,750.
so
the
condition
of
the
contract
was
not
met
and
this
backed
the
fact
that
the
house
was
appraised
and
a
lower
figure
caused
mr.
neustadt
--
that
he
testified
grave
concern.
he
then
satisfied
himself
that
the
reason
the
house
was
appraised
at
a
lesser
value
was
not
because
there
was
no
structural
defect
in
the
house.
that
was
his
major
concern.
he
was
relying
in
short
on
that
appraisal.
now,
having
the
information
that
the
house
is
appraised
for
$22,750,
he
then
made
another
offer
in
a
contract
dated
april
9th,
1957.
and
this
time,
the
offer
was
conditioned
upon
receiving
an
appraisal
for
the
property
at
$22,750.
the
condition
was
met.
the
--
the
closing
and
the
--
and
the
transaction
took
place
on
july
2nd.
he
moved
into
the
property
on
july
10th
and
on
july
11th,
he
noted
some
--
the
house
began
to
settle,
cracks
began
to
appear
in
the
plaster.
he
had
the
damage
investigated
by
drilling
a
hole
in
the
--
through
the
cement
floor
in
the
basement.
it
was
discovered
that
some
water
had
collected
under
there.
and
he
then
--
six
months
later,
brought
the
instant
case.
now,
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
first
that
there
is
no
duty
running
from
the
fha
to
an
unknown
purchaser
of
the
property
to
appraise
that
separately.
second,
that
even
if
such
a
duty
is
found
that
the
united
states
is
not
liable
for
negligent
misrepresentation
which
is
the
essence
of
this
case
whether
--
and
third
that
the
term
misrepresentation
as
it
is
set
forth
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
is
the
section
from
which
the
united
states
excludes
itself
form
liability
for
then
the
torts
set
forth
in
section
2880
(h)
of
that
act
includes
negligent
misrepresentation.
and
on
this
point,
i
am
not
going
to
take
the
time
of
the
court
to
argue
because
on
eight
different
occasions,
in
six
different
circuits,
including
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
case
at
bar,
it
has
been
held
unanimously
each
time
that
the
word
misrepresentation
included
in
section
2680
(h)
of
the
statute
means
and
includes
negligent
misrepresentation.
but
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
consider
our
second
point
very
briefly
which
is
that
the
gravamen
of
this
action
is
the
communication
by
an
agent
of
the
federal
government
to
the
--
mr.
neustadt
of
a
fact
upon
which
he
relied,
which
turned
out
to
be
untrue,
namely
that
this
house
which
he
purchased
had
--
contains
structural
defects.
mr.
neustadt
in
his
complaint
which
is
reprinted
in
the
printed
record
on
page
2
in
paragraph
6,
states
that
he
relied
upon
that
provision
of
the
contract
of
sale
that
the
--
any
defect
in
the
property
would
be
disclosed
in
the
appraisal.
he
testified
and
his
testimony
is
contained
on
page
15
that
he
understood
the
fha
appraisal
would
disclose
matters
of
the
kind
about
which
he
had
any
concern,
so
he
wouldn't
have
to
hire
an
expert
to
look
at
the
property.
he
testified
that
on
page
17
of
the
printed
record
that
he
established
to
his
satisfaction
that
the
lower
appraisal
did
not
and
could
not
in
fact
represent
the
difference
in
an
appraisal
--
represent
the
existence
of
a
defect.
and
on
page
18,
he
testified
that
once
he
and
his
wife
were
convinced
that
the
appraisal
did
not
indicate
any
unsoundness
in
the
home,
he
made
another
offer
for
the
property.
now,
this
was
the
--
a
communication
made
to
him
through
this
appraisal,
which
as
it
turned
out,
was
erroneous
and
upon
which
he
relied
to
purchase
this
property
and
it
was
this
communication
that's
the
very
essence
of
the
common
law
tort
of
misrepresentation.
mr.
neustadt
also
wrote
a
letter
to
the
fha
which
is
in
the
record
on
file
before
this
court.
it's
not
reprinted
in
the
record,
but
stating
in
effect
that
he
--
the
same
terms
of
reliance.
now,
the
position
of
the
respondents
with
which
we
take
issue,
is
that
the
appraisers,
they're
not
--
they
say
they're
complaining
that
the
appraiser's
negligence
resulted
in
the
issuance
of
mortgage
insurance
and
consequently,
in
their
purchase
of
a
defective
structure
and
that
it
was
the
availability
of
this
insurance
and
not
the
receipt
of
the
appraisal
report,
which
in
--
in
effect
that
caused
them
to
purchase
the
house.
and
it's
our
position
that
this
house
--
that
that
is
simply
begging
the
question.
it's
an
--
an
attempt
to
escape
this
misrepresent
--
an
attempt
to
escape
liability
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
communication
to
them.
once
the
house
was
appraised
at
$22,750,
all
the
parties
concerned
knew
what
the
fha
would
--
the
amount
for
which
it
would
insure
the
mortgage.
and
thus
of
the
time
this
contract
was
complete,
the
damage
had
in
effect
be
done
--
been
done.
the
only
way
that
mr.
neustadt
could
then
have
gotten
out
of
his
bargain
was
if
he
were
deemed
a
poor
credit
risk,
not
if
he
were
--
if
the
house
were
found
to
be
structurally
defective.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
no,
sir.
the
fha
appraises
the
properties,
which
it
is
going
to
insure
to
determine
the
amount
of
the
mortgage
which
it
will
insure.
and
this
is
all
in
--
within
the
structure
of
the
basic
philosophy
of
the
national
housing
act,
which
is
to
encourage
private
capital
to
lend
money
so
that
much
needed
housing
can
be
constructed.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
under
section
226
and
1954,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
congress
imposed
upon
the
seller,
the
duty
of
transmitting
to
the
perspective
purchaser
a
written
copy,
a
written
statement
of
the
amount
of
the
fha
appraisal.
and
the
form
of
that
statement
is
set
forth
in
the
record
at
page
53,
it's
government's
exhibit
no.
2.
now,
the
purpose
of
the
congress
in
making
that
condition
was
to
put
the
purchaser
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
seller.
the
seller
already
had
that
information.
and
it
was
not
as
--
has
been
claimed
to
make
the
united
states
liable
to
the
purchaser
for
the
amount
of
the
difference
between
the
amount
of
the
appraisal
and
his
purchase
price.
and
if
the
court
please,
if
there
was
--
any
doubt
on
that,
i
would
refer
to
an
exert
from
the
hearings
that
the
--
held
by
the
congress
at
that
time
which
appears
on
page
28
of
the
government's
brief
in
which
senator
bennett
asks
the
nuestadt
case
that
in
effect,
he
send
and
a
question
whereto
mr.
cole
then
the
commissioner.
but
in
the
last
analysis,
the
property
owner
cannot
say
to
the
federal
government,
well,
your
inspector
inspected
my
house
and
now
look
what's
happened
therefore,
you're
responsible,
therefore,
you
must
come
down
here
and
fix
it
up.
isn't
that
a
correct
statement
of
the
limitation,
mr.
cole?
i
think
so.
the
--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
i
am
not
familiar
--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
justice
black,
of
a
case
where
an
insurance
company
has
appraised
property
to
determine
whether
or
not,
it
should
insure
and
then
was
held
liable
to
a
perspective
purchaser
of
the
property,
it's
--
to
me,
it
is
a
novel
--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
this
case
arose
in
eastern
district
of
virginia.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yes,
sir,
in
alexandria.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
i
have
not
--
i
just
don't
know
of
any.
now,
mr.
latto
cites
a
virginia
case
in
his
brief,
which
goes
on
the
question
of
fraud,
but
i
don't
think
that
that
is
apropos
here.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
no,
sir.
it
would
not
because
i
think
first,
it
is
necessary
to
find
a
duty
running
from
the
federal
housing
administration.
two,
the
perspective
purchaser
to
appraise
that
property
carefully
and
here,
the
--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
it
is,
justice
whittaker.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
the
statute
mr.
justice
harlan
was
enacted
for
an
entirely
different
purpose.
the
--
and
the
--
in
the
government's
reply
brief
on
page
7,
the
purposes
step
is
set
out.
it's
to
help
protect
the
buyer
from
artificially
inflated
prices,
perhaps
beyond
the
replacement
cost
and
caused
by
these
easy
mortgage
terms
which
then
became
available.
and
also
set
out
on
page
6
is
the
report
of
the
conference
committee
of
the
--
at
which
time
the
bill
was
passed.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
oh,
i
don't
--
i'm
quite
sure
that
it
did
mr.
chief
justice
and
they
said
so
in
so
many
words
that
they
wanted
to
put
the
buyer
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
seller.
they
said
that
they
wanted
to
protect
the
buyer
from
this
artificially
inflated
prices
and
--
but
this
it's
secondary
purpose
of
the
act.
i
do
not
think
that
the
--
as
senator
bennett's
statement
there
and
it's
borne
out
in
the
balance
of
the
hearings
at
that
time.
i
do
not
think
that
the
congress
intended
to
impose
a
primary
duty
on
the
fha
running
to
a
purchaser
unknown
at
the
time
that
it
appraised
the
house,
to
appraise
the
house
that
carefully
for
that
purchaser's
benefit.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
and
it
ran
to
his
employer
--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
but
--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
--
i
don't
recall
the
full
--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
--
the
context
of
the
question
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
the
duty
here
is
for
of
the
--
the
appraiser
is
to
determine
for
the
united
states
what
the
value
of
that
property
is
so
that
the
fha
will
know
to
what
extent
the
--
it
should
approve
mortgage
insurance
and
--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
oh,
certainly
that
--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
this
is
a
tort
problem.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
i
said
--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
no
that's
--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
well
--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
--
the
tort
and
you
--
they're
quite
correct
that
the
--
this
is
--
this
is
a
tort
case
and
we're
now
trying
to
establish
to
whom
that
duty
run.
but
first,
we
have
to
establish
exactly
what
the
duty
is
and
what
--
what
the
liability
was
that
the
congress
intended
to
impose.
now,
i
--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
well
i
--
that's
--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
you'll
--
to
term
that
in
my
opinion
it
was
quite
clear
--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
what
they
wanted
to
do
and
what
they
intended
to
do.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yes
--
pardon
me?
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
no,
sir
--
no,
sir.
i
did
know
it.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
well,
i
think
if
the
court
please,
that
this
is
a
--
this
is
an
incidental
purpose
to
this
--
to
the
federal
--
the
national
housing
act,
i
don't
think
that
the
--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
in
this
--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
the
thrust
of
this
case
if
the
court
please,
is
to
indentify
the
tort
that
it's
--
that
has
occurred,
it's
the
tort
of
the
misrepresentation.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
now,
assuming
--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
the
fellow
is
careless,
but
the
--
to
identify
the
tort
is
the
duty
--
it's
the
task
that
we
ask
the
court
to
do.
to
identify
it
as
the
tort
of
misrepresentation,
because
it
was
the
communication
of
this
--
the
fact
that
there
was
a
structural
--
the
--
the
house
was
free
from
structural
defects
which
caused
the
damage
to
the
plaintiff.
now,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
no.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
that's
correct.
yes,
sir.
but
specifically
excluding
the
tort
of
misrepresentation
and
this,
the
tort
in
the
case
at
bar,
was
the
tort
of
negligent
misrepresentation.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
that's
right,
the
--
the
tort
of
misrepresentation
--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
and
therefore
this
being
a
tort
of
misrepresentation,
the
united
states
is
not
liable.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
i'd
--
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
--
the
united
states
does
not
--
this
is
our
position,
is
that
--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
--
there
is
no
lied
--
no
duty
running
from
the
fha
to
the
perspective
purchaser
that
that
is
incidental
to
the
main
purpose
of
that
section.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
i
do
not
know,
sir.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yes,
it
does.
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
indian
towing
case
and
in
the
somerset
food
case,
the
damage
would
have
occurred
there
without
any
misrepresentation.
the
--
at
the
lighthouse
not
been
working,
the
ship
with
the
(inaudible)
would've
gone
to
ground
had
the
--
it
didn't
make
any
difference
that
the
communication
wasn't
the
sine
qua
non
of
the
injury.
in
this
case,
the
communication
--
he
was
injured
solely
by
the
communication
and
that
is
the
very
essence
of
the
tort
of
misrepresentation,
as
it's
set
out
in
glanzer
against
shepard
and
the
erie
railroad
case
and
the
other
cases
cited
in
our
brief.
it's
a
very
different
situation
from
of
the
situation
as
in
the
(inaudible)
case
where
the
united
states
undertook
a
duty
to
clear
the
channel
and
failed
to
clear
it
properly
and
then
told
people
that
it
had
cleared
it
properly.
and
then
the
ship
runs
a
ground.
that
is
not
the
concept
of
the
tort
of
misrepresentation.
it's
the
communication
here
that
caused
the
damage.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
the
--
that
argument
mr.
chief
justice,
has
been
made
and
there
are
elements
of
misrepresentation
and
made
negligence
cases
just
as
in
this
case,
there
are
elements
of
negligence.
but
in
this
case,
if
the
negligent
appraisal
had
not
been
that
fact,
had
not
been
communicated
to
mr.
nuestadt
and
if
he
had
not
relied
on
that,
that
he
would
not
been
damaged
at
all.
this
is
the
classic
misrepresentation
case.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
it's
section
26
(voice
overlap)
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
no,
sir.
you
did
--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
they
--
they
are
--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yes,
sir.
down
reading
from
28
u.s.c.
2688,
and
it
begins,
the
provisions
of
this
chapter
and
section
1346
(b)
of
this
title
shall
not
apply
to
and
then
in
(h)
any
claim
arising
out
of
assault,
battery,
false
imprisonment,
false
arrest,
malicious
prosecution,
abuse
of
process,
libel,
slander,
misrepresentation,
deceit
or
interference
with
contract
rights.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
no,
sir,
they'd
--
they
don't.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
the
--
the
eight
times,
six
different
circuits
have
held
that
that
term
misrepresentation
means
negligent
misrepresentation.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
no,
sir.
definitely
not
and
as
judge
frank
pointed
out
in
the
jones
case
that
the
statute
includes
deceit
which
--
and
where
you
do
have
to
have
that
element.
