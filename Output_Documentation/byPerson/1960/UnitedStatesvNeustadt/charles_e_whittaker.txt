isn't
that

justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
not
only
that.
not
only
appraise
it
carefully,
but
to
show
that
the
duty
was
owing
to
the
purchaser.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that's
all?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
that
fundamental?
first
of
all,
there
must
be
a
right
that
the
prospective
purchaser
whoever
he
is,
has
against
this
appraiser.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
understand
you
it
would
not
contend,
however,
that
fha
insures
anything
more
than
mortgage,
which
it
approves.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
latto,
does
the
government
concede
negligence
at
all
here?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
does?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
is
the
distinction
so
far
as
liability
for
negligence
is
concerned
between
the
fulger
mortgage
company
here
in
washington,
which
makes
appraisals
or
money
lenders
and
issue
certificates
of
appraisal.
on
the
one
hand
and
the
fha
on
the
other
hand,
to
an
eventual
buyer
of
the
house
subject
to
a
mortgage,
what's
the
distinction
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
in
liability?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
wouldn't
that
apply
as
well
to
this
private
appraiser?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
but
now
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that's
macpherson
against
buick,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
i'm
having
trouble
getting
to
my
mind,
doesn't
(inaudible)
right
that
when
a
person
files
an
fha
insures
a
house,
not
only
gets
and
insured
mortgage,
but
he
gets
an
insurance
against
defect.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
negligence
here
seems
to
be
established
on
the
mere
existence
of
the
facts
that
the
house
did
crack.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
understood
him
to
say,
counsel,
mr.
orrick,
to
say
that
