mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
mr.
orrick
has
pointed
out,
there
are
three
issues
in
this
case,
two
of
which
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
or
not
of
the
con
which
ordinarily
reached
this
court,
when
it's
the
ordinary
question
of
whether
there
was
a
duty
of
care,
whether
there's
an
action
and
negligence.
another
is
what
is
the
nature
of
this
case?
we
assert
that
it
is
the
common
law
action
of
negligence.
the
government
asserts
that
it's
a
cause
of
action
for
negligent
misrepresentation.
the
third
question
as
the
one
just
averted
to
and
that
is
i
think
an
important
question
of
interpretation
of
a
provision
of
the
tort
claims
act.
does
the
exception
for
misrepresentation
in
28
u.s.c.
2680
(h)
cover
deliberate
misrepresentation
or
does
it
include
negligent
misrepresentation
as
well?
i
should
point
out
briefly
in
respond
to
justice
frankfurter's
question
that
the
common
element
of
all
of
the
torts
accepted
in
2680
(h)
is
deliberateness.
there's
no
element
of
conscious
false
in
assault
and
in
libel
and
in
slander
and
then
the
other
torts
included
in
that
section.
but
there
is
a
common
element
of
deliberateness
and
i
hope
to
return
to
this
question
at
the
latter
part
of
my
argument.
i
would
like
to
return
to
the
question
raised
by
justice
whittaker
and
justice
frankfurter
and
that
is
the
question
whether
there
was
a
duty
of
care
owed
to
these
respondents
by
the
government,
in
connection
with
the
inspection
and
appraisal
functions
under
the
national
housing
act.
we
are
in
agreement
with
the
government
that
the
purpose
or
the
purposes
of
the
national
housing
act
in
--
in
particular
of
these
functions
under
the
national
housing
act,
is
a
matter
of
critical
importance.
we
don't
think
it
is
the
only
relevant
factor,
but
certainly
it
is
one
that's
entitled
to
very
great
weight.
and
mr.
orrick
said
in
the
course
of
his
argument
that
this
--
there
was
a
secondary
purpose
to
protect
the
prospective
purchaser
of
a
home.
my
difficulty
with
the
argument
is
that
congress
said
otherwise
and
said
so
quite
unmistakably.
now,
i
go
back
to
the
initial
enactment
of
the
national
housing
act
when
this
procedure
for
inspection
and
appraisal
was
first
instituted.
and
in
the
very
first
report
of
the
federal
housing
administration,
it
was
explained
that
the
existence
of
this
function
provided
a
purchaser
of
a
home
with
the
benefit
which
was
not
available
to
the
purchaser
of
a
home
which
would
be
financed
through
a
conventional
mortgage.
they
wanted
to
say
that
the
purchaser
will
have
what
probably
only
a
small
percentage
of
home
buyers
have
ever
had
in
the
past.
the
benefit
of
knowing
that
the
appraised
value
set
upon
the
property,
which
he
intends
to
buy
or
build
by
a
trained
evaluator
acting
in
accordance
with
the
procedure
designed
to
reduce
to
a
minimum
errors
that
might
result
in
casual
or
hasty
conclusions.
and
in
the
subsequent
year,
the
fha
explained
that
the
valuation
and
inspections
made
by
trained
staff
members
of
the
administration
tends
to
ensure
that
the
dwelling
is
in
a
good
physical
condition.
similarly
a
few
years
later,
the
fha
explains,
tends
to
ensure
that
the
dwelling
is
in
good
physical
condition.
now,
this
will
become
less
equivocal
as
i
go
on.
two
or
three
years
later,
the
5th
annual
report
explained,
the
administration
aims
that
no
homeowner
or
home
seeker
should
through
ignorance
of
the
insured
mortgage
plan,
enter
into
a
transaction
without
having
the
benefit
of
a
careful
disinterested
examination
of
the
property,
which
is
the
examination
that
is
made
by
the
fha
inspector."
we
now
move
over
to
1954
when
the
rather
thorough
going
revision
and
amendment
of
the
national
housing
act
was
made.
and
in
the
course
of
that
revision,
attention
was
given
to
the
program
under
which
homes
or
mortgages
insuring
single
family
homes
are
issued
by
the
federal
housing
administration.
the
congress
indicated
a
--
a
considerable
dissatisfaction
with
an
attitude
that
had
developed
within
the
fha.
the
agency
had
been
regarding
itself
more
or
less,
as
the
hand
making
of
the
mortgage
lending
industry
and
of
the
construction
industry.
and
congress
took
some
paying
to
ensure
that
this
would
not
be
the
approach
that
it
brought
to
the
performance
of
its
functions
under
the
act.
congress
provided
that
for
the
first
time
in
1954,
that
a
written
statement
of
the
appraised
value
would
have
to
be
furnished
to
a
perspective
purchaser
of
the
property.
and
the
legislative
history
is
very
clear
as
to
what
congress
had
in
mind.
congress
explained
that
well,
to
be
sure,
the
fha
should
be
concerned
with
protecting
its
insurance
fund,
the
builder
and
the
mortgagee
against
loss.
it
said
that
it
feel
that
there
is
a
need
for
change
in
the
approach
or
philosophy
of
--
of
administration
that
the
federal
housing
administration
appears
to
have
manifested
that
thus
far.
your
committee
fully
appreciates
the
importance
of
maintaining
a
high
level
of
housing
production.
but
these
objectives
should
not
obscure
the
fact
the
that
first
responsibility
of
congress
and
they
emphasized
first
and
that
of
any
agency
administrating
--
administering
part
or
all
of
the
housing
program,
is
to
protect
and
preserve
the
public
interest
in
general
and
the
rights
of
homeowners
in
particular,
then
the
report
went
on.
it
is
your
commit
--
committee's
considered
opinion
and
unless
contrary
views
are
expressed
or
amendments
are
offered
and
there
were
no
contrary
views
expressed
and
no
amendments
offered,
it
is
the
intent
of
congress
that
the
hhfa
and
its
constituent
agencies
one
of
which
is
the
fha,
in
their
administration
of
the
program
which
they
are
authorized
to
carry
out,
shall
at
all
times
regard
as
a
primary
responsibility
--
as
a
primary
responsibility,
their
duty
to
act
in
the
interest
of
the
individual
home
purchaser.
now,
this
same
act
provided
an
additional
protection
to
home
buyers,
those
persons
who
were
buying
new
homes,
this
was
not
a
new
home,
this
home
had
been
built
some
time
in
the
past
before
it
would
have
been
purchased.
in
connection
with
the
new
home
program,
congress
provided
that
the
builder
was
required
to
issue
a
certification
to
the
purchaser
that
his
home
had
been
built
in
accordance
with
the
plans
and
specifications
upon
which
the
fha
based
its
appraisal.
congress
went
onto
explain,
however,
this
is
still
in
the
senate
report,
while
this
affords
a
measure
of
protection
to
the
purchaser,
it
does
not
protect
him
against
all
structural
defects,
poor
materials
or
poor
workmanship.
basically,
the
homeowner
is
dependent
upon
sound
underwriting
by
the
fha
and
va
and
--
and
effective
inspection
on
compliance
program
and
your
committee
would
like
to
direct
the
attention
of
the
fha
to
the
importance
that
attaches
to
them.
and
a
later
point
in
the
same
report,
the
committee
said,
it
should
be
noted
as
was
discussed
earlier
in
the
report
that
the
requirement
of
certification
is
only
supplemental
to
the
compliance
and
inspection
systems
of
the
fha
and
va
which
are
the
primary
means
of
insuring
the
construction
of
sound
homes.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
under
the
national
housing
act,
the
fha
issues
insurance
to
the
mortgage
lender.our
claim
is
not
based
on
the
national
housing
act.
our
claim
is
brought
under
the
tort
claims
act.
the
tort
claims
act
provides
that
were
a
governmental
function
is
carried
out
there
is
an
obligation
to
carry
out
this
function
with
care.
and
if
it's
carried
out
negligently
and
an
individual
is
damaged,
he
recovers
not
because
he
has
been
given
a
right
of
action
under
the
national
housing
act,
but
only
because
the
congress
has
waived
sovereign
immunity
under
the
tort
claims
act.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
1946,
i
believe.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
1934
with
the
housing
act
and
the
amendment
that
i
have
been
discussing
--
legislative
history
that
i've
been
reading
to
the
court
is
in
connection
with
the
1954
amendment.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
that
--
that
is
not
my
position,
sir.
i
do
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
certainly
not.
i
agree
that
if
this
is
held
to
be
the
tort
of
negligent
misrepresentation
and
if
the
court
aggressed
with
the
courts
of
appeals
that
the
term
misrepresentation
in
2680
(h)
is
to
be
read
to
include
negligent
misrepresentation,
then
we
lose
our
case.
i
argue
first
that
this
is
not
the
tort
of
negligent
misrepresentation,
but
the
tort
of
negligence,
so
that
2680
(h)
is
not
applicable
at
all.
i
argue
second,
that
if
this
is
considered
to
be
the
tort
of
negligent
misrepresentation,
then
2680
(h)
is
inapplicable
because
it
was
not
intended
to
include
negligent
misrepresentations,
the
claims
arising
out
of
negligent
misrepresentations,
but
only
claims
arising
out
of
deliberate
misrepresentation.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
they're
wholly
unrelated,
i
agree
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
there
are
certain
exceptions
in
the
tort
claims
act,
which
i
agree
are
capricious.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
yes,
a
deliberate
misrepresentation.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
no.
i
--
i
don't
honestly
feel
like
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
i
don't
think
so
justice
frankfurter,
for
this
reason.
i
--
i'm
really
adopting
the
position
taken
by
the
court
below
which
says
that
there
are
many
claims
known
to
our
law
in
which
there
is
an
element
of
misrepresentation.
despite
this
fact,
the
courts
have
applied
the
rules
of
law
of
negligence,
of
libel,
of
slander
and
so
on.
they
said
that
in
each
case,
you
have
to
examine
the
facts
and
see
what
the
gravamen
of
the
action
is.
what
is
the
essential
element
of
the
tort?
if
the
essential
element
is
the
negligence
in
the
performance
of
the
act
and
if
--
and
it
happens
to
have
been
embodied
in
a
report,
this
does
not
deprive
the
plaintiff
from
being
entitled
to
sue
on
the
basis
of
his
cause
of
action
in
negligence.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
well,
i
--
i
hope
to
show
in
a
moment
that
it's
not
strange,
but
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
yes,
i
make
that
argument.
i
--
i
certainly
do
and
i
--
i
would
like
to
proceed
to
that
argument
if
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
certainly,
justice
harlan.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
i
think
it
must
be
federal
law.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
well
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
no,
let
me
withdraw
that,
if
i
may.
the
--
the
issue
of
federal
law
is
how
the
term
misrepresentation
in
2680
(h)
is
to
be
interpreted.
that
seems
to
me
clearly
a
federal
law
question.
the
question
of
what's
your
cause
of
action
is,
i
mean
this
--
this
brings
back
again,
this
area
that
we
have
thought,
we
put
behind
us
many
years
ago,
i
think
is
--
is
essentially
a
common
law
question.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
yes,
this
case
is
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
i
--
i
--
as
i
say,
i
--
i
misspoke
before
and
i
think
that's
--
that
the
correct
answer
to
your
honor's
question
is
that
it
would
be
decided
by
state
law.
unfortunately,
this
is
the
problem
that
we
have
here
with
the
introduction
of
fact
and
notice
pleading
in
this
century.
the
courts
have
been
little
concerned
with
this
particular
issue.
they
haven't
attempted
to
decide
whether
your
cause
of
action
is
negligence
or
whether
your
cause
of
action
is
negligent
misrepresentation.
indeed,
there
are
some
question
in
my
mind
as
to
whether
there
is
a
tort
of
negligent
misrepresentation,
because
recovery
on
these
set
of
facts
only
began
within
the
last
50
or
60
years
and
this
parallel,
the
situation
in
which
the
causes
of
action
were
at
the
same
time
being
abandoned.
so
that
there's
very
little
authority
on
this
point
that
can
be
gleaned
that's
helpful,
certainly,
there's
nothing
in
virginia.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
oh,
yes.
the
government
concedes
that
the
inspection
was
negligently
performed
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
yes.
this
issue
was
not
in
the
case
and
that
the
respondents
were
damaged
and
the
amount
of
the
recovery,
all
this
is
conceded.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
well
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
--
the
distinction
i
--
i
suppose
rest
upon
this.
i
said
before
that
the
question
of
a
purpose
in
making
the
inspection
was
something
that
had
considerable
weight.
there
are
other
factors
involved
that
decide
--
that
determine
whether
or
not,
there
is
to
be
liability
--
the
foreseeability
--
foreseeability
of
harm
mr.
justice
frankfurter
mentioned,
the
nature
of
the
relationship
between
the
parties,
the
extent
to
which
a
single
negligent
act
will
cause
very
large
damage.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
well,
it
--
it
would
depend
upon
the
purpose
for
which
he
was
pertained.
here,
we
have
this
very
strong
expression
of
congressional
purpose
to
protect
the
buyer.
if
in
fact,
this
private
appraiser
understood
that
the
function
of
his
job
was
to
protect
the
purchaser
of
a
home,
then
i
say
he
would
be
liable.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
in
that
connection,
may
i
--
may
i
just
read
a
--
an
illustration
from
the
restatement
of
a
--
the
law
of
torts,
which
bears
on
this.
it's
not
in
my
brief,
but
it
presents
a
--
a
very
similar
situation.
a,
wishing
to
sell
his
car
to
b,
rights
to
c,
an
expert
mechanic,
asking
him
to
inspect
the
car
and
forward
to
him,
a,
a
letter
stating
its
condition
in
order
that
he
may
give
it
to
b,
who
as
he
tells
c,
is
a
perspective
purchaser.
in
such
case,
c
may
properly
be
regarded.
that's
the
expert
who
did
the
inspection,
as
supplying
information
for
the
guidance
of
either
b
or
any
other
purchaser,
whom
a
may
find.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
well,
no.
that's
much
closer
to
this
case
it
seems
to
me
than
macpherson
against
buick.
this
is
where
a
man
is
retained
to
make
an
inspection
and
a
restatement
editors
least,
insist
that
he
would
be
liable
to
any
person
to
whom
that
property
may
be
sold,
if
this
inspection
was
negligent.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
oh,
i
think
this
is
an
entirely
separate
question,
one
that
i'm
anxious
to
get
to.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
and
if
i
may,
i
will
turn
that
now.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
you
have
not,
sir.
i
--
i'm
content
that
i
think
to
rest
upon
the
line
of
inquiries
suggested
by
the
government
in
its
brief.
in
its
summary
of
argument,
it
says,
"it
is
clear
that
this
exception
from
misrepresentation
bars
negligent
as
well
as
willful
misrepresentation."
they
point
out
that
five
circuits
have
so
held
and
then
say,
"this
interpretation
is
supported
by
the
structure
of
the
tort
claims
act,
by
its
history
and
by
the
general
principles
of
tort
law."
i
think
the
government
is
wrong
on
all
three
counts.
if
i
can
turn
first
to
the
structure
of
the
tort
claims
act,
the
government's
argument
essentially,
is
the
2680
(h)
excludes
misrepresentation
and
deceit
and
they
rely
essentially
on
the
cannon
of
construction
that
says
that
you
must
strive
to
give
meaning
to
every
word
in
a
statute
and
since
deceit
already
covers
false
--
knowingly
false
misrepresentations
--
misrepresentation
must
be
read
to
mean
negligent
misrepresentations
as
well.
i
certainly
don't
deny
that
there
are
times
when
the
cannons
of
construction
are
usual.
if
the
hazard
has
enterprise
even
in
this
case,
i
should
point
out
that
if
you
give
misrepresentation,
the
meaning
urged
by
the
government
or
indeed
the
meaning
which
we
urge
that
be
no
need
for
the
word
deceit
in
the
statute,
so
that
one
or
the
other
word
is
going
to
be
superfluous
here.
we
also
rely
on
an
equally
vulnerable
cannon
of
construction
and
that
is
that
words
should
be
given
meaning
in
accordance
with
the
context
in
which
they're
found.
and
if
2680
(h)
is
read
in
its
entirety
rather
than
just
selecting
these
two
words
from
the
statute,
you
find
that
it
represents
an
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
to
exclude
virtually
all
of
the
deliberate
torts
known
to
the
common
law,
assault,
battery,
false
imprisonment
and
the
like.
and
at
least
one
can
start
with
the
assumption
that
it
may
will
be
that
deliberate
torts
were
intended
to
be
excluded
and
nothing
more.
if
we
turn
to
the
legislative
history
and
i'll
come
back
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
yes,
you
may.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
it
certainly
would
and
there
is
some
sense
in
this,
if
your
honor
please.
and
this
involves
the
structure
of
the
tort
claims
act
which
i'll
come
[laughs]
back
to
before
going
to
the
legislative
history.
as
this
court
well
knows,
this
act
took
about
30
years
of
congressional
consideration
before
it
was
adopted.
and
congress
was
plagued
throughout
this
period
by
private
acts
and
they
were
concerned
about
the
kind
of
(inaudible)
of
justice
that
was
rendered
by
this
group.
when
the
act
was
adopted,
the
underlying
premise
involved
the
recognition
of
the
fact
that
with
the
government
increasingly
involved
in
large
scale
enterprises,
mistakes
were
going
to
be
made.
people
are
going
to
be
injured
because
of
the
negligence
of
government
employees.
the
feeling
was
that
the
damage
when
it
occurred
ought
not
to
be
visited
upon
the
individuals
who
happened
to
be
concerned,
but
ought
to
be
shared
by
the
country
generally.
and
so
essentially,
what
we
have
is
an
act
which
makes
the
government
liable
for
the
negligence
of
its
service.
now
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
he
gets
no
insurance
at
all,
because
if
the
inspection
has
been
properly
conducted.
but
the
man
is
in
error,
he
even
makes
a
--
the
mistake
of
judgment.
there's
no
cause
of
action
here
at
all.
it's
--
it's
necessary
that
you
prove
that
he
was
negligent
when
he
made
the
appraisal.
(voice
overlap)
--
this
is
not
a
guarantee
or
an
insurance
to
the
purchaser
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
oh,
that's
--
that
is
not
the
case
at
all.
i
mean,
i
--
i
--
this
has
not
been
an
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
the
petitioner
does
not
say
that
and
the
record
does
not
say
that.
there
was
overwhelming
proof
in
this
case
that
any
competent
appraiser
would
have
found
very
serious
structural
defects
that
existed
in
this
house
at
the
time
his
inspection
was
made.
this
is
a
very
difficult
matter
to
establish
and
it
will
be
established
in
very
few
cases
i
may
say,
but
it
happened
to
be
established
in
this
case.
negligence
was
not
inferred
from
the
fact
the
damage
at
all.
there
was
a
specific
proof
on
this
court.
if
i
may
return
to
this
question
of
the
meaning
of
misrepresentation
in
2680
(h),
if
--
if
in
truth
that
the
--
the
broad
and
just
purpose
of
the
tort
claims
act
is
to
make
the
government
liable
for
the
negligence
of
its
employees
and
this
court
in
indian
towing
said
that
this
was
a
purpose
of
the
act.
i
see
no
reason
for
this
very
grudging
and
niggardly
interpretation
that
the
government
seeks
to
give
to
the
word
in
this
representation.
it
detracts
from
rather
than
further,
is
the
central
purpose
of
the
act.
it
results
in
denying
recovery
in
many
cases
where
there
plainly
should
be
recovery,
in
some
of
the
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeals
that
government
relies
upon,
were
such
cases.
it
has
almost
nothing
to
commend
it,
except
for
these
cannon
of
construction
upon
which
they
rely.
and
if
i
have
sometime,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
legislative
history.
here,
we're
something
of
a
disadvantage.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
the
reference
is
to
2680
(h),
the
explicit
reference
is
where
to
the
statute
--
where
through
that
section
as
a
whole,
not
2680,
but
2680
(h)
and
to
the
exception
of
assault
and
battery.
there
were
no
explicit
references
to
misrepresentation
and
deceit.
there
were
several
references
i
should
say,
to
2680
(h),
the
section
which
had
all
11
torts.
and
these
references
are
perfectly
clear.
the
department
of
justice
which
had
hand
in
drafting
the
bill,
sent
a
formal
memorandum
to
the
congress
and
it
explained
that
these
were
deliberate
torts.
the
assistant
attorney
general
testified
in
connection
with
the
legislation
and
he
informed
the
committee
that
these
were
deliberate
torts.
the
senate
reports
on
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
well,
they
are
certainly
commonly
thought
of
as
deliberate
torts.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
well,
it
is
true
and
the
government
has
relied
very
heavily
on
this
that
there
are
occasions
on
which
these
torts
can
be
committed
negligently.
but
i
think
in
trying
to
ascertain
the
intent
of
congress,
it's
fair
to
assume
that
we're
dealing
with
a
number
of
lawyers
and
other
laymen
and
the
common
understanding
of
these
torts
is
that
they
are
deliberate.
for
example,
there
were
several
law
review
articles
written
shortly
after
the
enactment
of
the
tort
claims
act
by
scholars
in
the
law,
professor
gilhorn
at
columbia,
professor
davis
who's
written
so
much
in
the
administration
of
law
field,
and
mr.
gately
who
was
in
the
tort
claim
section
of
the
department
of
justice
at
the
time.
all
of
these
men
referred
naturally
and
without
further
consideration
to
the
exception
for
deliberate
torts
included
in
2680
(h).
now,
it
maybe
their
refined
analysis
will
find
in
occasional
case
in
which
these
torts
are
not
committed
deliberately.
but
certainly,
the
common
understanding,
the
explanation
by
the
framers
of
the
bill
to
the
congress
was
that
2680
(h)
included
deliberate
torts
alone.
i'd
like
to
say
a
word
about
the
question
suggested
by
justice
whittaker,
which
related
to
the
fact
that
if
this
--
if
a
--
if
a
deliberate
misstatement
had
been
made
by
an
inspector,
i
agree
that
there
would
be
no
liability
and
it
seems
initially
odd
that
there
should
be
liability
for
a
--
in
effect,
a
lesser
tort.
but
if
one
looks
to
the
structure
of
the
act,
it
seems
fairly
plain
that
libel,
slander,
conscious
misrepresentation,
this
is
the
kind
of
activity
which
is
not
ordinarily
engaged
in
by
a
government
employee
as
part
of
his
governmental
functions.
if
a
man
slanders
someone,
perhaps
in
law,
he
would
be
regarded
as
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment,
but
as
a
practical
matter,
he's
not
engaged
in
carrying
out
a
governmental
function.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
is
carrying
out
this
inspection
function
and
negligently
performs
it
to
someone's
injury,
then
we
have
a
case
which
falls
within
the
classic
pattern
of
the
tort
claims
act.
so
that
isn't
at
least
bit
hard
that
congress
might
have
decided
that
were
a
government
employee
strays
off
the
reservation
as
it
were
and
access
an
individual
that
there
should
be
no
governmental
liability,
except
for
the
unusual
case
where
they
would
still
be
the
private
bill
available.
this
seems
to
me
a
perfectly
sensible
reason
for
2680
(h).
now
finally,
mr.
orrick
opened
his
argument
by
pointing
out
that
if
this
case
were
affirmed,
there
would
be
vast
liability
visited
upon
the
united
states.
i
think
i
have
two
brief
answers
to
this.
first
if
it
were
true,
his
argument
would
be
addressed
to
the
congress
and
not
to
this
court
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
(inaudible).
more
important
perhaps
is
the
fact
that
it
is
not
true.
under
the
tort
claims
act,
the
united
states
is
liable
only
in
circumstances
were
a
private
person
would
be
liable
in
like
circumstances
to
a
private
individual.
under
the
common
law,
as
it
has
been
generally
recognized
throughout
the
united
states,
they
had
been
limitations
imposed
upon
the
kind
of
widespread
liability
that
mr.
orrick
is
talking
about,
where
a
single
negligent
act
is
likely
to
give
rise
to
very
widespread
liability.
courts
have
uniformly
held
that
there
is
no
duty
of
care,
the
classic
case
in
this
area
is
the
cardozo
--
judge
cardozo's
opinion
in
ultramares
against
touche
where
an
accountant's
certificate
which
might
be
sent
very
widely
abroad,
was
held
not
to
give
--
not
to
give
rise
to
a
duty
of
care
in
favor
to
anyone
that
might
read
and
rely
upon
it.
this
is
to
be
compared
with
his
same
opinion
in
glanzer
against
shepard,
where
a
public
weigher
was
held
liable
to
a
third
party
who
relied
upon
his
certificate
of
weight,
because
he
had
reason
to
expect
that
such
reliance
will
be
given
and
where
the
extent
of
the
liability
would
be
limited.
so
long
as
--
as
in
this
case,
the
total
damage
which
could
be
inflicted
upon
the
united
states
is
the
value
of
this
house,
the
damage
contented
for
the
government
simply
would
not
result.
