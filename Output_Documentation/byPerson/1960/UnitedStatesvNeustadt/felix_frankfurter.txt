mr.
orrick
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understood
you
or
did
you
ascent
to
justice
whittaker's
question
that
the
crucial
question
is
whether
the
duty
of
correct
or
reliable
appraisal
where
at
the
question
was
to
whom
did
that
duty
run?
certainly,
the
appraiser
had
a
duty
of
making
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
non
--
a
non-negligent
or
a
non-negligibly
--
negligence
protect
him
correctly,
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
--
i
understood
do
you
agree
that
the
question
is
a
crucial
question
as
to
whom
did
the
duty
to
run,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
agree
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
whatever
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
doubt
that
the
fha
--
that
he
had
a
duty
--
an
appraiser
had
a
duty
to
fha,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
question
recently
put
or
just
put
by
chief
justice,
wasn't
it
reasonably
to
be
expected
that
--
that
there
wouldn't
be
a
buyer
or
buyers
or
candidate
for
purchase.
would
--
that
to
be
expected,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
reasonably
do
you
expected
that
the
buyer
would
make
real
---
would
--
would
look,
to
take
into
account,
whether
conclusively
or
not,
the
appraisal
made
for
fha?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
--
i
--
i
ask
you
this
question?
it's
whether
to
whom
the
duty
runs?
that
legal
question,
this
is
a
tort
problem
is
problem,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
tort
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
the
question
to
whom
a
duty
of
care
non-negligence
runs
isn't
something
that
--
that
is
mathematically
determinable
or
that
you
find
expressed
in
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
reasonable
likelihood
is
that
there
would
be
a
purchaser
and
that
he
would
rely,
why
isn't
this
come
within
the
buick
against
macpherson
doctrine?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
reasonable
expectation
is,
why
is
that
any
different
from
the
buick
doctrine,
mr.
orrick?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
the
congress
didn't
tell
us
in
terms,
did
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
couldn't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
mean
to
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
statute
do
it
in
terms?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
statute
in
terms
say
that
they
restrict
the
obligations
for
violation
of
the
duty
of
care
to
the
fha,
if
this
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
then
we
asked
to
argue
from
analogy
as
reasonableness
of
things,
etcetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
my
--
my
problem
is
why
isn't
this
a
buick
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
incidental
than
--
than
the
manufacturer
of
a
buick
car
to
the
wholesaler
or
then
sells
(inaudible)
to
the
sixth
fellow
on
the
line.
why
anymore
incidentally
in
one
case
than
the
other?
justice
felix
frankfurter
part
of
was
dealing
here
was
taking
of
conventional
concept
of
the
law
to
applicability.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reaching
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
reaching
the
tort,
not
the
tort,
the
tort
is
perfectly
fine,
merely
the
fellow
is
careless.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
this
were
--
if
you
--
can
you
give
me,
put
the
case
leaving
out
the
united
states,
no
doubt
at
all
that
introduced
a
new
principle
of
liability
in
the
sense
that
it
was
truly
immunity
of
the
sovereign
from
suit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
didn't
create
a
new
--
a
new
conception
of
liability,
did
it?
quite
the
contrary
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
passing
down,
took
over
the
liability
for
this
same
situation,
if
done
between
private
people,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
the
answer
of
your
answer,
if
i
may
suggest,
by
mr.
justice
whittaker
is
that
that
to
whom
the
liability
runs,
that
is
not
the
question.
what
you
say,
there
is
a
far
out
exception
of
the
scope
of
fraud
liability
which
the
congress
created.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh
that's
a
very
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
where
is,
may
i
trouble
you
just
one
more
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
don't
set
forth
a
full
text
of
the
exception
in
age,
where
is
that?
have
you
tried
to
(inaudible)
in
front
of
you
mr.
orrick?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
have
trouble
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
within
those
exceptions,
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
anything
else
do
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
are
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
notice
the
tendency
of
the
problem
of
government
if
you
just
ask
there
is,
with
the
immediate
problem
with
statute
not
involved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
that's
a
very
good
idea,
i
may
say
so,
because
when
one
wants
to
see
a
--
concept
at
its
context.--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
most
of
those
things
only
involve
element
of
dishonesty,
do
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
assault,
doesn't
it
slander
and
libel
doesn't
it
--
it
appears
in
the
contract
where
(inaudible)
doesn't,
you
are
arguing
that
--
what
happen
to
the
rulings
as
to
whether
misrepresentation
must
be
merely
a
representation
that's
inactivate
or
representation
that's
falsely
based?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
to
have
an
element
of
conscious
forces.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
--
what
was
the
date
of
the
tort
claims,
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
act
in
which
is
--
what
was
the
holding
act
under
which
this
transaction
took
place?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
you're
saying
is
--
what
you're
saying
is
that
--
that
taking
--
calling
the
statements
from
the
housing
act
is
an
implied
repeal
of
the
exclusion
of
misrepresentation
acts
from
the
tort
act
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
not
in
turn,
but
that's
when
it
gets
down
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
these
purposes
of
congress
in
the
two
acts
referring
to
it,
are
wholly
unrelated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
wholly
unrelated
and
congress
in
the
--
in
the
federal
tort
act
sought
it
in
its
own
vibe
in
the
capricious
way,
more
capricious
(inaudible)
and
to
exclude
certain
categories
of
misconduct
or
conduct
which
has
between
man
and
man,
would
give
rise
to
assume,
that's
correct
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
assume
(inaudible)
even
to
the
court
of
these
two
problems.
one,
misrepresentation
contrary
wise
to
what
the
various
courts
of
appeals
have
held
means
a
deceitful
conduct,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
deliberate
--
deliberate
falsification.
and
secondly
that
what
was
said
in
the
housing
act
must
be
joined
to
and
the
--
the
--
in
case
you
will
go
against
your
--
negligent
on
misrepresentation
then
in
any
event,
it
is
an
implied
repeal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
the
word,
that's
what
it
gets
down
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
evade
myself.
you're
arguing
that
misrepresentation,
one
of
the
selective
excluded
class
or
strange
reasons
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
all
depends
without
(inaudible)
that
the
exception
in
age,
including
misrepresentation
followed
by
deceit,
misrepresentation
does
not
to
include
the
time
of
age
that
the
other
courts
of
appeals
have
included.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
whole
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whole
actually
states
on
state
conception
of
tort.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
myself,
that
this
were
pure
man
to
man
issue,
i
would
have
no
trouble
at
all
if
this
case
coming
within
the
general
--
the
conference
of
the
general
area
of
buick
against
macpherson.
i
have
difficulties
in
finding
--
in
finding
any
--
in
being
able
to
jump,
no
matter
what
quotation
you
can
find
on
quotations,
as
to
the
extent
in
which
the
costumed
--
or
eventually
purchase
is
to
be
protected
in
jumping
from
that
fact
to
construing
what
misrepresentation
mean
anything
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
apologize
to
how
to
this
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
move
on,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
this
appraisal
as
for
reason
for
its
own,
purposefully
put
in
a
line
of
appraisal,
will
that
be
excluded
on
the
tort
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
i
don't
reduce
your
time
that
you've
left
if
i
ask
you
whether
there's
any
explicit
reference
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
meaning
that
was
in
the
mind
with
the
draft
which
they
explicitly
in
words
as
to
what
misrepresentation
of
purposes
of
age
was
intended
to
cover.
is
there
any
explicit
--
i
don't
--
i
--
await
your
argumentation.
but
is
there
anything
which
tells
me
that
congressman
jones
said
misrepresentation
means
thus
himself?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
couldn't
be
slander
and
libel
and
not
deliberate
torts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
really,
well,
the
most
of
the
(inaudible)
and
slander
and
libel,
except
when
it
purposefully
done
and
(inaudible)
non-deliberative
forms.
