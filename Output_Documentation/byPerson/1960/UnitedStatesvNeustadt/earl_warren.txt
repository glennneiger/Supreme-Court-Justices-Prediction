chief

yes.
chief
justice

warren
was
that
requirement
in
any
way,
for
the
benefit
of
the
purchaser
or
is
it
just
for
the
government's
own
information?
chief

earl
warren
but
wouldn't
that
indicate
that
in
passing
this
bill,
congress
had
some
concern
about
the
buyer
and
was
trying
to
protect
the
buyer
in
some

i
suppose

could
say
that
the
government
having
represented
that
it
would
--
that
it
would
maintain
this
lighthouse
and
having
failed
to
do
so,
it
--
it
misrepresented
to
--
to
the
shippers
going
by
that
--
that
there
were
no
dangers
there.
