where
is

card?
justice

that's
what
i
--
it
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
position
do
you
take,
if
you
have
taken
any,
on
whether
the
delay
in
arraignment
was
illegal
under
new
york
law?
justice

mr.
heffron,
my
question
had
not
quite
gone
that
far.
i
have
to
say,
there's
been
any
--
what
was
the
law
in
new
york
without
reference
to
this
delay,
is
it
legal
or
illegal,
the
delay,
this
length
of
time.
i
--
i
didn't
ask
about
the
exclusionary
rule.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
look
at
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
was
the
point
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
well,
that
was
still
not
quite
what
i
was
asking.
i
think
your
answer
and
i
want
to
be
sure
on
that,
under
the
circumstances
here,
are
we
to
assume
that
it
was
illegal
to
get
this
man's
statement
without
--
without
arraigning
him
as
the
statute
requires,
illegally?
do
the
circumstances
here
bring
it
toward
in
the
promptness
that's
required
by
the
state
statute?
