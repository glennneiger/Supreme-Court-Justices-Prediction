mr.
william
b.
mahoney
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
the
writ
in
this
particular
matter
covers
two
judgments,
the
petitioner,
after
separate
trials,
having
been
convicted
of
the
federal
statute
relative
to
bank
robberies
and
incidental
crimes.
the
question
presented
here
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
petitioner,
coppola,
made
an
oral
and
a
written
statement
to
federal
officers
while
he
was
being
illegally
detained
in
the
custody
of
the
buffalo
police
department
in
violation
of
section
165
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
of
the
state
of
new
york.
the
question
presented
here
is
as
to
whether
or
not
that
oral
and
written
admission
were
admissible
under
the
principle
of
anderson
against
the
united
states
in
which
case
the
mcnabb
rule
of
exclusion
was
applied
to
a
statement
made
to
a
federal
officer
while
be
--
being
illegally
detained
by
the
sheriff
of
the
state
of
tennessee.
and
a
further
question
arises,
namely,
that
irrespective
of
the
collaboration
and
the
working
agreement
that
was
mentioned
in
the
anderson
case
and
was
the
basis
for
that
particular
decision,
whether
or
not
in
the
interest
of
fair
play
that
the
oral
and
the
written
statement
were
inadmissible
because
of
the
fact
that
they
were
held
illegally.
that
is,
the
petitioner
was
held
illegally
after
an
arrest
on
suspicion
as
well
as
being
detained
in
violation
of
the
code
provision
that
i've
just
mentioned
to
the
court.
in
this
particular
situation
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
--
there
were
two
indictments
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
it's
not
a
coerced,
no,
your
honor.
it's
the
illegal
detention
under
the
anderson
and
the
mcnabb
rule.
there
were
two
indictments
returned
against
the
petitioner
and
others.
the
first
indictment
charged
that
on
february
15th
of
1956,
the
petitioner
and
an
individual
by
the
name
of
d'antuono,
entered
a
branch
bank
of
the
manufacturers
and
traders
trust
company
in
the
city
of
buffalo,
new
york
and
that
they
escaped
with
something
in
or
around
$50,000.
the
indictment
charged
the
petitioner
and
d'antuono
when
actually
committing
that
particular
crime.
the
second
indictment
that
was
returned
at
the
same
time
had
to
do
with
a
different
date,
namely
october
2nd,
1956.
it
was
a
different
bank,
the
liberty
branch
or
a
branch
of
the
liberty
bank
of
buffalo
and
in
that
particular
indictment,
the
petitioner
was
not
accused
of
having
perpetrated
the
robbery
of
the
bank.
that
part
of
the
indictment
was
directed
against
the
same
d'antuono
as
well
as
three
other
individuals;
john
roche,
millio,
and
simmons,
but
there
were
three
additional
counts
in
that
indictment
that
accused
the
defendant
of
aiding
and
abetting
in
that
particular
matter.
as
i
said,
there
were
two
separate
trials.
the
defendant
was
found
guilty
in
both
of
them,
was
sentenced
to
20
years,
the
second
sentence
to
run
consecutively
--
consecutively
with
the
first.
now,
relative
to
the
m.
&
t.
and
i'd
like
to
approach
that
in
as
much
as
the
earliest
in
time,
on
february
15th
of
1956,
the
m.
&
t.
branch
bank
was
entered
by
two
men,
both
of
whom
were
masked.
money
was
taken
and
there
was
an
escape.
as
early
as
february
27th
of
1956,
that's
approximately
12
days
after,
the
petitioner
was
taken
into
custody
by
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
in
the
city
of
buffalo,
new
york.
and
while
he
was
merely
held
at
their
office,
a
telephone
call
was
made
to
the
officers
of
the
bank
instructing
them
that
at
the
close
of
the
business
hours
on
that
particular
day
that
they
should
hold
their
employees
in
the
same
positions
that
they
were
in
on
february
15th
when
the
holdup
occurred.
and
after
that
arrangement
was
made,
the
petitioner
was
taken
to
the
locale
of
the
m.
&
t.
bank.
and
when
the
f.
b.
i.
men
got
him
out
there
in
the
east
side
of
the
city,
they
handed
him
a
silk
stocking
and
told
him
to
pull
it
over
his
face.
and
after
he
had
done
that,
the
door
was
opened,
and
of
course
this
was
after
the
banking
hours
of
the
day.
the
door
was
opened
and
the
f.
b.
i.
gave
him
directions
to
hold
his
hand
in
this
particular
fashion
to
enter
into
the
bank.
and
then,
they
directed
him
to
follow
their
instructions
which
were
the
substance
of
what
had
been
given
to
the
f.
b.
i.
by
the
employees
of
the
bank
on
the
15th
of
february,
1956,
the
day
the
holdup
occurred.
as
a
result
of
it,
the
petitioner
followed
the
instructions
of
the
f.
b.
i.
and
he
went
around
the
bank,
he
approached
the
manager
then
the
assistant
manager,
then
the
cashier's
cages,
he
did
certain
things
relative
to
drawers,
and
then
he
also
followed
their
instructions
until
he
got
outside
of
the
bank.
when
they
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
approximately
12
days
your
honor,
the
difference
between
february
15th
and
february
27th
of
1956.
when
he
got
outside
of
the
bank,
the
petitioner
was
released
by
the
f.
b.
i.
investigation,
of
course,
as
you
can
readily
appreciate,
followed
from
that
particular
time,
but
with
no
molestation
as
far
as
actual
custody
interrogation
of
the
petitioner
was
concerned.
now,
as
to
the
liberty
bank,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
petitioner
was
not
an
actual
participant
but
nevertheless,
he
was
accused
of
being
an
aider
and
an
abetter.
when
these
cases
came
on
for
trial
and
they
came
on
for
trial,
the
first
of
them
in
july
of
1957,
we
had
testimony
in
the
m.
&
t.
bank
case
that
emanated
from
witnesses,
one
of
whom
was
a
man
by
the
name
of
byars.
and
byars
was
a
deputy
sheriff
of
the
county
of
erie
who
was
doing
some
undercover
work
for
the
f.
b.
i.
and
he
testified
as
to
some
admissions
that
the
petitioner
had
made
to
him
concerning
the
m.
&
t.
or
the
manufacturers
and
traders
bank
job
and
in
addition
to
it,
d'antuono,
the
co-defendant
in
the
m.
&
t.
job,
testified
for
the
government.
and
then
gordon
eddy
and
a
man
by
the
name
of
jensen,
two
members
of
the
f.
b.
i.
testified
after
a
preliminary
hearing
without
the
presence
of
the
jury,
testified
as
to
an
oral
and
a
written
confession
that
they
secured
from
the
petitioner
in
the
buffalo
police
headquarters
on
the
night
of
january
10th,
1957.
now,
that's
approximately
11
months
after
the
commission
of
the
crime
and
approximately
10
1/2
months
from
the
time
that
the
petitioner
had
reenacted
the
crime
at
the
direction
of
the
f.
b.
i.
after
the
hearing
without
the
presence
of
the
jury,
the
court
decided
as
a
matter
of
law
that
there
was
no
illegal
detention
and
just
brushed
aside
the
fact
that
anderson
against
the
united
states,
mcnabb
against
the
united
states
were
not
applicable.
in
the
liberty
bank
job,
it
was
practically
the
same
type
of
testimony,
byars
again,
the
deputy
sheriff
having
testified,
d'antuono,
and
again
eddy
after
an
examination
of
mr.
eddy
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury,
the
court
ruled
as
a
matter
of
law
that
there
was
no
unnecessary
delay
that
there
was
no
application
of
the
anderson
rule.
before
a
panel
court
in
the
second
circuit,
both
judgments
were
reversed
with
one
judge
dissenting
and
they
reversed
on
the
grounds
that
the
factual
picture
in
the
coppola
cases,
both
of
them,
that
the
confessions
were
improperly
received
in
evidence
under
the
authority
of
anderson
against
the
united
states.
at
that
particular
time,
judge
moore
indicated
a
dissent
in
july
of
1959
with
the
statement
that
an
opinion
would
follow
later.
that
opinion
was
never
handed
down
until
december
4th
of
the
same
year.
that
was
the
same
day
that
the
court
of
appeals
granted
the
application
of
the
government
for
a
hearing
en
banc
and
that
order
was
dated
december
the
4th,
1956,
which
was
the
date
of
judge
moore's
dissenting
opinion.
before
the
court
en
banc,
which
was
made
up
at
that
time
of
five
members,
the
court
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
with
two
judges
dissenting,
judges
waterman
and
clark
and
they
held
that
there
was
--
the
anderson
rule
was
not
applicable,
and
that
what
the
f.
b.
i.
members
had
done
with
the
local
police,
were
consistent
with
normal
police
procedure
and
affirmed.
now,
in
addition
to
the
factual
picture
here,
i've
referred
to
byars
the
special
deputy
sheriff
of
the
county
of
erie.
the
testimony
in
the
case
shows
that
as
early
as
november
5,
1956,
which
was
approximately
two
months
before
the
petitioner's
arrest
that
byars
had
conversed
with
the
petitioner.
and
that
the
petitioner
had
made
the
admission
to
byars
about
complicity
in
the
manufacturers
and
traders
robbery.
and
that
he
was
making
written
reports
to
the
f.
b.
i.
and
the
testimony
is
positive
that
throughout
november
and
december
of
1956,
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
had
received
a
number
of
reports
relative
to
the
so-called
admissions
--
excuse
me
--
that
had
been
made
by
the
petitioner,
coppola,
to
byars.
now,
as
of
january
7
of
1957,
special
agent
roche
and
i
might
say,
your
honors
that
the
special
agent
roche
that
i
refer
to
is
one
of
the
three
prime
movers
of
the
members
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation,
whose
conduct
in
the
anderson
case
was
construed
as
making
or
carrying
out
a
working
arrangement
with
state
police
in
the
anderson
case
itself,
roche
having
taken
three
of
the
statements
in
the
anderson
case
back
in
1940.
now,
a
special
agent
in
charge
of
the
buffalo
office
and
having
byars
report
in
his
possession
of
having
as
the
proof
shows
here
that
roche
testified
without
the
presence
of
the
jury
that
we
and
the
buffalo
police
from
the
time
of
the
robbery
in
february,
1956
up
to
and
including
january
7,
when
roche
contacted
the
buffalo
police,
that
we
worked
this
case
mutually.
whenever
we
had
a
problem
that
we
were
confronted
with,
we
assigned
an
agent
and
a
police
officer
to
work
it
out
and
they
worked
it
out
between
them.
and
in
connection
with
that,
the
examination
of
roche
that
was
being
conducted
was
so
surprising
to
the
court
and
although
the
record
has
sufficiently
close
your
honors
that
it
never
shows
any
inflection
of
a
voice
whatsoever,
and
i
respectfully
refer
you
to
page
112
of
the
record
and
this
was
the
examination
that
was
being
conducted
by
myself
and
it
starts
right
at
the
top
of
the
page.
but
your
honors
will
notice
at
approximately
the
middle
of
the
page
while
i'm
examining
this
officer
about
the
cooperation
that
occurred
between
february
of
1956
and
the
time
of
the
arrest
which
was
january
10,
1957,
i
asked
him,
“and
during
the
investigation,
you
would
--
cooperated
more
or
less
with
the
local
authorities
and
they
with
you?”
“that's
correct.”
then
i
asked
him,
“when
i
say
cooperated,
you'd
relay
information
to
them”
and
here's
his
answer.
“well,
we
worked
very
closely
with
the
detective
bureau
of
the
buffalo
police
department
and
we
worked
the
case
mutually.”
and
you
worked
very
closely
and
the
court
exclaimed
at
that
time
to
the
agent
on
the
stand,
“what
are
you
saying?”
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
court
evidently
was
somewhat
surprised
at
the
utterances
that
were
being
made
by
special
agent
roche
of
the
f.
b.
i.
at
that
time,
you
will
find
at
page
113
and
it's
the
second
question
from
the
top,
“what
was
the
type
of
your
conduct?”
his
answer
is,
“if
we
had
any
information
we
wanted
to
work
on
mutually,
we
would
work
with
the
detectives
and
we
would
assign
a
detective
and
an
agent
together
to
work
it
out.”
“and
that
was
done
relative
to
the
m&t
stick
up,
was
it
not,
”answer,
“correct.”
now,
that's
the
part
that
--
of
the
collaboration
and
the
cooperation
and
the
working
arrangement
that
was
in
existence
for
a
period
of
eight,
nine,
or
10
months
from
february
1956
up
to
and
including
january
of
1957.
in
addition
to
that,
you
have
what
i've
referred
to
of
byars,
the
special
deputy
sheriff,
that
he
had
been
making
these
written
reports
to
the
f.
b.
i.
in
november
and
december
of
1956.
now,
we
approach
1957,
january.
on
january
the
5th
of
1957,
roche
contacts
chief
golombeck
or
chief
of
detectives
golombeck,
of
the
buffalo
police
department.
he
makes
a
query
of
them
as
to
whether
or
not,
there's
an
unsolved
crime
on
their
books
involving
one
paul,
that's
all
the
information
that
was
given.
golombeck's
retort
was
to
the
effect
that
yes,
we
have
a
situation
on
our
book
and
for
a
--
relative
to
a
redlinski
and
with
that
information,
then
roche
at
his
office
in
the
f.
b.
i.
takes
photographs
of
the
petitioner
and
two
others
and
takes
them
over
the
headquarters
to
golombeck
and
at
that
particular
time,
there's
testimony
here
coming
from
golombeck
to
the
effect
that
an
identification
was
made
by
redlinski
of
the
petitioner.
now,
that
was
january
7th,
1957.
in
spite
of
the
identification
that
appears
in
the
record,
nothing
was
done
by
the
buffalo
police
as
far
as
the
petitioner
was
concerned.
he
wasn't
bothered
on
the
7th.
he
wasn't
bothered
on
the
8th,
nor
on
the
9th
of
january
of
1957.
not
content
with
that,
on
january
the
9th
of
1957
and
this
is
not
stated
to
the
court
as
any
criticism
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
for
making
such
a
report,
but
on
january
9th,
1957,
roche
again
calls
golombeck
and
tells
him
that
we
have
some
information
that
there's
going
to
be
a
robbery
tomorrow
morning
on
the
east
side
of
the
city
of
buffalo.
and
in
addition
to
roche
informing
the
--
golombeck
of
that
fact,
he
also
testified
that
he
went
to
the
office
of
john
dwyer,
the
district
attorney
of
erie
county
and
informed
him
of
the
same
fact
and
also
told
mr.
dwyer
that
we
are
investigating
coppola,
the
petitioner,
relative
to
the
manufacturers
and
traders
stickup
in
february,
1956
and
the
liberty
bank
stickup
in
october
of
1956.
the
following
morning,
golombeck
takes
four
or
five
different
squads
and
fans
them
out
around
the
eastside
of
the
city
of
buffalo.
at
approximately
10
am
in
the
morning
with
a
shotgun
in
the
hands
of
one
officer
and
with
golombeck
and
harry
klenk,
who
is
head
the
homicide
squad,
they
ordered
the
petitioner
and
two
others,
d'antuono
and
simmons
over
to
occur.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
on
a
street,
in
an
automobile.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
in
the
--
in
the
vicinity
of
it,
yes.
when
i
say
blocks,
i
want
that
fairly
clear
to
the
court.
they
admit
that
the
arrest
was
on
suspicion.
there's
no
doubt
about
that,
harry
klenk
admits
that
in
the
testimony,
golombeck
admits
it
in
the
testimony.
they
admit
they
had
no
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
the
petitioner
and
there's
nothing
in
this
testimony
that
indicates
that
golombeck
was
making
an
arrest
because
of
an
identification
that
was
made
on
the
7th
of
january
by
redlinski
of
the
petitioner.
he
does
say,
that
as
golombeck
does
say
in
his
record
that
he
knew
that
an
officer
had
the
authority
or
the
right
to
make
an
arrest
for
a
felony
not
committed
in
his
presence
if
he
had
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
it
had
been
committed.
that's
as
far
as
golombeck
would
go
in
his
testimony.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor.
that
as
a
result
of
this
not
at
the
--
when
you
say
request,
i
would
like
to
make
my
position
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
in
other
words,
what
i'm
saying
is
they
didn't
come
out
and
give
many
mandate
or
command.
you
go
out
and
arrest
coppola
and
hold
him
in
your
custody
until
we
get
an
opportunity.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
the
panel
court
found
to
the
contrary
that
it
had
--
the
arrests
have
been
made
at
the
suggestion
or
the
request
of
the
working
arrangement
and
the
collaboration.
then
the
en
banc
court
overturned
that,
three
judges
stating
that
there
was
insufficient
to
bring
it
within
the
anderson
rule
and
there
were
two
dissents
in
that.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
when
did
i
first
raise
that,
your
honor?
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
in
the
trial
itself.
that's
why
just
as
soon
as
they
swore,
federal
agent
eddy,
i
objected
and
asked
for
a
hearing
without
the
presence
of
the
jury.
and
that
hearing
was
conducted
not
only
in
the
m.
&
t.
bank
case,
but
it
was
also
conducted
in
the
liberty
bank
case.
both
of
those
hearings
took
place
without
presence
of
the
jury.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
no.
if
your
honor
--
what
the
government
claims
in
this
particular
case
is
that
a
--
a
question
arose
that
first
came
in
the
second
case
which
was
the
liberty
bank
case
and
at
that
particular
time,
assistant
district
attorney
browton
who
was
trying
the
case
for
the
government
utilized
the
word
that
i
made
a
claim
that
the
arrest
was
made
at
the
behest
of
the
f.
b.
i.,
and
i
asserted
that
i
did
not
make
that
claim.
and
the
word
behest
that
was
used
to
be
perfectly
candid
with
the
court,
my
only
contact
with
it
had
been
that
it
meant
some
kind
of
a
command
or
a
mandate.
but
knowing
that
roche
was
one
of
the
agents
in
the
1940
case
that
came
before
this
court
and
that's
anderson
against
the
--
anderson
against
the
united
states,
i
think
you
can
readily
appreciate
that
knowing
that
and
even
if
i
didn't
know
it,
i
wouldn't
ask
an
officer,
“did
you
command
or
did
you
direct
or
did
you
mandate
that”
because
the
stereotype
answer
that
you
generally
receive
is
in
the
negative
and
certainly,
i
don't
think
count
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor.
i
do
when
i
say
that
mr.
roche's
testimony
relative
to
the
working
together
the
assigning
of
a
--
an
f.
b.
i.
agent
with
the
detective
to
work
out
the
details
throughout
the
entire
year
of
1956
is
a
very
strong
indication
of
the
fact
that
they
were
working
together.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
pardon
me.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
on
the
m.
&
t.
case.
it
wasn't
on
anything
at
that
particular
time
that
had
to
do
with
a
state
violation
unless
you
would
want
to
bring
into
this
particular
picture
that
the
robbery
of
a
bank
is
both
a
violation
of
a
federal
statute
as
well
as
a
state.
that
has
been
urged
by
the
government
in
this
case,
but
what
they
were
working
on
was
that
roche
was
the
one
that
was
directing
the
activities
to
solve
the
m.
&
t.
and
the
liberty
bank.
and
it
was
he
who
is
contacting
golombeck
and
assigning
his
agents
to
work
with
the
detective,
and
the
police
assigning
the
detective
to
work
with
an
f.
b.
i.
agent
in
order
to
get
out
a
solution
to
those
particular
crimes.
now,
as
i
say
that
on
january
10th,
the
arrest
was
made,
and
it
was
made
by
these
particular
officers.
and
may
i
say
to
you
that
just
as
soon
as
the
arrest
was
made
by
detective
chief
golombeck
and
the
head
of
the
homicide
squad,
and
this
is
brought
out
through
the
testimony
of
agent
roche
prior
to
the
time
that
they've
delivered
the
petitioner
and
the
two
others
to
the
headquarters,
golombeck
from
his
car
or
from
a
stop
they
made
phones
roche
at
the
office
of
the
f.
b.
i.,
“we've
made
the
arrest
and
we're
on
our
way
to
headquarters.”
in
other
words,
that
the
statement
was
made
by
golombeck
to
roche
by
telephone
that
“we've
arrested
the
petitioner
and
the
others
and
we're
on
our
way
to
headquarters.”
that
was
at
approximately
11
o'clock
or
within
an
hour
after
the
man
had
been
taken
over
to
the
side
of
the
street
itself.
before
noon
on
that
particular
day,
january
10th,
1957,
roche
leaves
f.
b.
i.
headquarters
and
he's
into
the
chief
of
detectives
office
in
the
buffalo
police
department
and
as
i
say,
that
was
shortly
before
noon.
now,
may
i
say
this
to
you
that
roche
definitely
admitted
in
his
examination
and
you
will
find
this
in
the
record
at
107
and
108,
and
that
is
that
they
were
on
their
way
to
headquarters
and
in
connection
with
that,
may
i
call
your
attention
to
the
record
of
115
and
116
wherein
roche
said
in
substance
that
he
expected
such
a
call
from
golombeck
if
anything
developed.
now,
as
i
say,
shortly
before
noon,
you
have
roche
in
headquarters
and
he
went
over
there,
and
this
is
the
purpose
for
which
he
went
over
and
again,
i
respectfully
call
your
attention
to
the
record
113
and
114
and
you
will
find
there
that
roche
said
his
purpose
in
going
to
police
headquarters
was
to
find
out
if
anything
occurred
as
to
the
m.
&
t.
bank,
the
liberty
bank,
and
the
branch
of
the
marine
trust
as
it
developed
that
there
was
some
conversation
between
byars
and
coppola
relative
to
an
anticipated
foray
in
the
future
involving
the
marine
trust,
but
that
has
never
materialized
and
this
is
the
sole
reference
to
it
in
the
record
itself.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
they
found
nothing
on
them,
your
honor
with
the
exception
of
some
keys.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
keys.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
keys.
they
had
no
weapons,
no
instruments
of
any
kind
and
it's
conceded
by
both
golombeck
and
klenk
who
were
the
two
prime
arresting
officers,
there
was
a
third
one
by
the
name
of
segate
along
with
them
but
he
was
merely
a
patrolman
and
had
been
taken
along,
but
both
golombeck
and
klenk
said
that
they
were
arrest
--
they
arrested
them
on
suspicion.
that
in
addition
to
it,
they
had
no
warrant,
and
in
addition
to
it,
klenk,
as
i
will
point
out
later,
put
no
charge
against
the
petitioner
until
1
o'clock
on
the
afternoon
of
january
11th
of
1957
or
the
day
following
their
arrest.
now
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
that
charge
was
2124
and
404
--
404,
your
honor.
that's
robbery
and
larceny
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
--
under
the
penal
law
of
the
state
of
new
york.
now
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
redlinski,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
pardon
me?
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
do
you
want
their
page
in
the
record?
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor.
they
had
information
to
that
effect.
that
answered
the
question,
sir?
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
yes.
coppola
would
be
involved.
now,
after
roche
got
into
headquarters
at
approximately
at
noon
time,
his
contacts
were
then
with
golombeck,
chief
of
detectives,
klenk,
both
of
whom
were
the
arresting
officers,
john
dwyer,
the
district
attorney
of
erie
county,
who
had
been
apprised
the
day
before
and
when
he
found
out
that
there
had
been
no
interrogation
of
coppola
at
that
particular
time,
then
all
four
of
them
went
to
lunch.
they
were
gone
to
lunch
until
2:30
in
the
afternoon.
now,
i
say
that
that
is
a
definite
significant
factor
because
unless
you
would
want
to
take
just
one
definite
stand
and
say
that
it
was
merely
a
sociable
gathering
over
that
period
of
time
from
approximately
noon
until
2:30,
i
certainly
think
that
that
is
a
factor
that
can
be
taken
into
consideration
by
the
court
as
to
a
continuation
of
that
working
arrangement
that
was
existent
between
roche
and
his
agents
on
the
one
hand
and
golombeck
and
klenk
on
the
other.
what
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
excuse
me.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
i
think
that's
a
confidential
communication.[attempt
to
laughter]
it
was
never
ascertained
as
far
as
the
record
was
concerned.
however,
as
i
say,
i
think
that
the
court
is
in
a
position
to
draw
the
inference
that
at
that
particular
lunch,
there
was
discussion
about
the
arrest
that
had
been
made
and
the
charge
that
should
or
should
not
be
preferred
in
a
detention
that
should
take
place
and
who
was
to
do
the
examining
and
the
reason
that
i
say
this
to
the
court
is
because
of
this
factor.
when
the
four
of
them
returned
to
headquarters
at
2:30,
harry
klenk,
one
of
the
arresting
officers,
the
head
of
the
homicide
squad,
started
the
interrogation
of
the
petitioner
coppola.
and
although
he
was
questioning
him
about
some
state
crime,
nevertheless,
he
admitted
that
he
interrogated
him
about
the
manufacturers
and
traders
trust
stickup
or
holdup
and
he
also
interrogated
him
about
the
liberty
bank
situation.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
the
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
the
larceny.
yes,
your
honor.
that's
what
i
answered
to
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
--
i
think
justice
warren
or
clark
before
that,
they
are
state
violations.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
now,
he
doesn't
claim
and
--
and
he
never
claimed
in
his
testimony
that
--
as
to
whether
or
not
his
interrogation
was
concerning
the
federal
side
of
an
order
of
the
state.
the
record
is
devoid
of
any
testimony
as
to
which
of
the
two
factors
he
examined
them
about,
but
at
3:30,
when
his
interrogation,
coppola
ceased,
roche
and
dwyer
both
of
whom
had
remained
at
headquarters
during
klenk's
interrogation
of
coppola,
then
those
two
individuals,
roche,
the
special
agent,
and
dwyer,
they
took
up
a
joint
questioning
of
the
petitioner
coppola.
and
in
that
questioning,
roche
was
concerned
with
the
m.
&
t.
job
and
he
was
concerned
with
the
liberty
bank
job,
and
he
was
also
concerned
as
to
whether
or
not
he
could
get
permission
from
the
petitioner
to
affect
the
search
of
his
home
which
was
in
niagara
falls,
some
26
miles
away.
now,
that
joint
conference
between
these
two
men,
the
special
agent
roche
and
the
district
attorney
ended
at
approximately
4:00
o'clock.
now,
in
the
city
of
buffalo,
our
city
court,
where
arraignments
on
state
offenses
are
held,
adjourns
at
5:00
o'clock
at
night.
the
united
states
commissioners
have
no
designated
hours
but
they're
generally
there
doing
the
regular
business
hours
of
the
day
and
that
would
be
5:00
o'clock.
what
they
did
with
coppola
at
that
particular
time
was
to
put
him
back
in
confinement
and
he
stayed
in
confinement
until
approximately
9:00
o'clock,
that
particular
night,
this
is
january
10th
of
1957.
at
about
8:00
o'clock,
special
agent
roche
assigned
six
deputies,
two
of
whom
were
assigned
to
coppola,
to
go
to
police
headquarters
for
the
purpose
of
getting
a
statement.
and
i
might
say
at
this
particular
time
and
i
do
urge
this
upon
the
court
that
in
as
much
as
they
had
the
written
reports
of
byars
to
the
effect
of
an
admission
having
been
made
by
the
defendant
or
by
the
petitioner
as
to
both
of
these
cases,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
they
were
no
longer
investigating
because
they
had
more
than
sufficient
proof.
that
is
the
federal
agents
had
more
than
sufficient
proof
in
their
possession
where
they
could
have
gone
over
to
a
commissioner
on
november
the
5th,
1956
or
up
until
the
end
of
december
of
1956
and
secured
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
the
petitioner.
and
they
--
if
their
evidence
was
believable,
it
was
more
than
sufficient
to
warrant
a
conviction
on
a
question
of
fact
in
the
federal
courts.
but
it
would
seem
to
me
at
this
particular
stage
that
when
roche
engages
in
these
calls
of
january
7th
and
9th
and
then
he's
so
active
on
january
10th,
and
then
he
assigns
men
to
go
over
and
interrogate
coppola,
he's
not
interested
in
investigation
of
a
crime
nor
is
he
interested
in
trying
to
absolve
somebody
who
might
be
suspected
but
his
sole
interest
on
that
basis
or
his
sole
interest
is
the
basis
of
going
over
and
getting
a
statement
for
the
purpose
of
conviction.
so
what
happens?
they
go
out
--
they're
assigned
there
at
about
8:00
o'clock
at
night.
and
now
this
is
agent
eddy
and
jensen's
testimony
that
they
went
over
to
headquarters
at
approximately
8:00
o'clock
at
night,
that
they
waited
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor,
this
is
january
10th,
and
at
about
9:00
o'clock,
the
police
officers
took
the
petitioner
out
of
the
cell
block
and
brought
him
to
a
small
office
where
the
two
agents,
eddy
and
jensen
were
seated.
that
the
interrogation
started
at
about
9:02
at
night
and
it
finished
at
12:45
the
following
morning.
and
during
that
particular
time,
their
testimony
was
to
the
effect
that
they
secured
the
oral
admission
and
then
the
written
admission
from
coppola.
now,
during
that
particular
time
and
while
they
were
in
custody,
this
is
another
significant
factor,
harry
klenk,
the
head
of
the
homicide,
who
stated
that
he
was
investigating
alleged
state
crimes
between
the
hours
of
9:00
and
12:45
the
following
morning,
on
three
occasions,
he
went
to
the
cell
block
that
is
located
on
the
fourth
floor
for
the
purpose
of
processing
whatever
had
to
be
done
relative
to
the
investigation
of
a
state
crime.
on
each
occasion,
he
found
that
they
were
still
being
interrogated
by
the
federal
agents
and
he
did
not
pursue
what
he
had
in
mind
relative
to
the
investigation
of
state
crime,
but
he
merely
--
whether
a
matter
of
convenience
as
the
government
contends
or
a
matter
of
courtesy,
nevertheless,
that's
what
did
occur.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
this
was
in
police
headquarters
of
the
buffalo
police
department.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor,
the
lockup.
now,
these
men
were
--
the
petitioner
as
well
as
the
others
that
have
been
brought
in
that
particular
day,
they
were
then
incarcerated
until
approximately
11:00
o'clock
the
following
morning.
at
10:00
o'clock
the
following
morning,
special
agent
roche
sent
one
of
his
agents
over
to
u.s.
commissioner
to
secure
a
warrant
to
file
the
information
of
course
and
then
he
made
a
request
to
the
buffalo
police
to
deliver
them
over
to
a
commissioner's
office
for
purpose
of
arraignment,
that
is
deliver
him
into
the
custody
of
the
f.
b.
i.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
that
was
january
the
11th
at
approximately
11:00
a.m.
you
must
bear
in
mind
and
i
think
as
i
develop
this
argument
that
you'll
be
satisfied
that
there
was
no
state
charge
had
been
placed
at
this
hour
of
january
11th
or
at
11:00
o'clock
or
january
the
11th
at
11:00
o'clock.
there
was
no
state
charge
had
been
placed
against
the
petitioner
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
on
january
11th,your
honor?
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
the
government
called
police
headquarters
and
talked
to
klenk
and
asked
him
if
he
would
deliver
the
petitioner
in
this
case
to
the
office
of
the
u.s.
commissioner
to
surrender
him
to
the
f.
b.
i.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
at
that
particular
time,
that
was
not
done
because
at
11:00
o'clock
in
the
morning,
the
petitioner
was
taken
over
to
the
office
of
the
district
attorney
in
what
we
call
an
erie
county
hall
and
they
were
held
there
or
he
was
held
there
until
approximately
1:00
p.m.
and
shortly
after
that,
the
petitioner
was
taken
to
the
city
court
of
buffalo
where
he
was
arraigned
at
approximately
2:00
p.m.
on
the
afternoon
of
january
the
11th,
1957,
on
the
charge
of
the
redlinski
holdup.
i
might
add
to
the
court
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
he
was
not
booked
according
to
klenk
until
1:00
or
1:10
on
january
11th,
1957.
and
i
have
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
about
an
hour
before
arraignment,
your
honor,
yes.
there
is
and
i
might
say
to
you
at
this
time
that
there
is
some
dispute
on
the
part
of
golombeck
about
being
booked
on
a
charge
but
i
think
i'll
clarify
that
for
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
when
i
discuss
that
particular
facet.
as
i
say,
the
man
was
arraigned
at
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon,
sometime
between
2:00
and
3:00
o'clock,
and
he
was
turned
over
then
to
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
who
brought
him
before
a
u.s.
commissioner
and
he
was
arraigned
for
the
first
time
before
a
u.s.
commissioner
at
4:00
p.m.
on
january
the
11th
of
1957.
now,
as
i've
said
to
the
court
here,
this
is
a
series
of
events,
the
evidence
of
which
in
the
petitioner's
opinion
as
well
as
my
own,
certainly
shows
that
there
was
a
definite
working
agreement
between
the
f.
b.
i.
and
the
buffalo
police
as
to
the
m.
&
t.
and
the
liberty
bank
jobs
from
february
1956
up
to
and
including
that
call
of
january
7th,
1957.
when
a
man
states
that
we
mutually
work
the
case
together,
i
can
conceive
of
no
other
deduction
that
could
be
consistently
drawn
that
that
wouldn't
spell
out
a
working
arrangement.
when
he
adds
to
it
that
we
would
assign
our
officers
one
with
the
other
to
work
out
the
details
of
the
case
in
order
to
further
the
investigation,
that
couldn't
be
anything
other
than
the
working
arrangement
that
was
mentioned
in
anderson
against
the
united
states
as
i
have
read
that
particular
decision.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
that's
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
that's
true.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
no,
very
true.
but
i
say
this
--
that's
why
i
say
to
the
court
here
that
the
circumstances,
not
one,
not
two,
but
a
number
of
them
that
would
show
as
to
what
they
were
doing
in
that
year
of
1956.
and
that
there
was
no
hesitancy
on
the
part
of
mr.
roche
to
admit
that
fact
while
he
was
being
examined
without
the
presence
of
the
jury.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
by
the
gambino
case,
your
honor?
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
i
would
say
that
there,
it's
suggestive
of
just
what
is
meant
and
even
in
spite
of
that
particular
fact,
i
do
say
to
the
court
that
the
circumstances
proven
here,
the
continuity
of
them,
the
number
of
them,
and
the
substance
of
what
occurred
certainly
would
seem
to
me
to
bring
it
within
the
byars
case
that
they
had
a
hand
in
it.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
no.
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
well,
the
question
then
arises,
your
honor,
as
to
the
breath
of
what
is
an
effort
to
solve
a
crime.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
well,
and
i
--
i
certainly
think
that
cooperation
between
those
agencies
would
be
commendable,
and
i
wouldn't
be
one
--
for
one
at
any
time
that
i
would
criticize
it.
but
when
it
goes
beyond
that
cooperation
and
when
this
circumvention
starts
to
assert
itself
and
the
means
employed
in
order
to
circumvent
some
of
the
rules
that
have
been
enunciated
by
this
court
and
we
can
see
from
a
factual
picture
of
this
kind
that
they
are
working
not
only
from
what
roche
have
to
say
but
a
strange
situation
and
i'd
like
to
call
this
to
the
court's
attention.
the
government
in
its
argument
at
page
45
of
its
brief
in
calling
the
court's
attention
to
the
record
in
the
anderson
case,
they
say
this.
this
is
about
the
ninth
line
from
the
top
of
the
page.
the
record
shows
that
the
federal
agents
and
the
state
officers
worked
hand
in
hand
with
each
other.
again,
the
facts
--
the
actual
facts
are
not
brought
out
or
admitted
but
i'd
--
would
refer
you
to
page
102
of
the
record
before
yourself.
on
my
recross
examination
of
detective
golombeck
and
when
i
was
querying
him
as
to
why
he
would
make
a
call
--
a
telephone
call
from
outside
of
headquarters
before
he
brought
these
men
to
headquarters
to
inform
special
agent
roche
that
“we've
made
the
arrest,
we're
on
our
way
to
headquarters,”
his
answer
was
this.
“we
work
hand
in
hand
with
them
in
the
sheriff's
office.”
now,
the
very
phraseology
that
the
government
says
was
present
in
the
anderson
case
is
just
about
what
golombeck
admits
in
the
examination
of
himself
before
the
trial
judge.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
that's
true.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
yes.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
sure
that
they
were
partners
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
well,
and
--
and
i
would
say
again
in
answer
to
that,
your
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
no.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
well,
i
--
i
would
say
very
candidly
to
the
court
that
i
think
that
the
admissions
made
by
special
agent
roche
as
well
as
those
made
by
chief
of
detectives
golombeck
show
that
they
were
partners
in
this
venture
and
not
only
were
they
partners
in
it
but
what
came
from
the
lips
of
special
agent
roche
was
that
he
and
his
agents
under
him
were
partners
with
golombeck
and
klenk,
and
members
of
the
buffalo
police
department
of
a
lesser
rank
and
i
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
that's
true.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
yes.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
that's
true,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
your
honor
please,
the
--
the
testimony
in
sort
of
a
capsule
form
is
that
the
interrogation
was
from
2:30
until
3:30
on
january
10th,
from
3:30
to
4:00
on
that
same
day
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
then
there
was
some
additional
interrogation
by
the
police
officers
relative
to
what
they
were
interested
in
and
then
the
interrogation
of
the
petitioner
started
at
9:02
p.m.
on
january
10th
and
ended
at
12:45
a.m.
on
january
the
11th,
1957.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
no.
no.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
the
only
--
the
only
evidence
in
the
case
was
that
the
state
had
never
indicated
that
it
was
going
to
do
anything
else
throughout
the
10th
as
well
as
the
11th
of
january
up
until
1:10
p.m.
to
hold
a
man
on
suspicion
or
as
they
call
it
on
open
charge.
does
that
answer
it?
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
thank
you,
your
honor.
now,
i
think
it's
quite
significant,
your
honors
that
what
i've
said
here
about
these
three
--
these
four
individuals
being
in
police
headquarters
and
going
to
lunch
on
that
particular
day.
that
that
certainly
has
tremendous
significance
to
myself
and
it
had
significance
to
judge
waterman
with
whom
judge
washington
joined
on
the
panel
court
before
the
court
of
appeals.
i
don't
think
that
being
a
little
realistic
that
we
could
think
that
four
officers
who
had
congregated
together
for
one
purpose,
m.
&
t.
and
this
came
from
the
lips
of
mr.
roche,
“for
the
m.
&
t.
and
the
liberty
bank
and
no
other
purpose
that
they
could
sit
through
a
period
of
12:00
until
2:30
in
the
afternoon
without
discussing
some
phase
of
it.”
and
i
think
it's
just
as
consistent
with
whatever
might
be
said
in
the
opposite
that
they
discussed
at
that
particular
time
as
“how
shall
we
proceed
from
here?
who'll
do
the
approaching?
how
long
we
got
to
hold
him
or
how
long
shall
we
hold
him?”
because
it
doesn't
seem
that
we
would
be
at
all
realistic
in
the
event
that
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
they
only
discussed
last
night's
poker
game
or
last
night's
theatre
that
they
might
have
attended
on
that
particular
occasion.
again
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
klenk.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
he's
the
buffalo
police
and
he
interrogated
as
soon
as
he
came
back
from
lunch
but
his
interrogation
as
i
said
before
covered
among
other
things
the
manufacturers
and
traders
trust
and
also
the
liberty
bank.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
well
i
--
if
they
weren't
afraid,
they
were
really
careful.
i
think
again
as
to
what
i
had
to
say
about
behest
which
i
said
to
the
court,
always
in
my
mind,
was
somewhat
of
a
command
or
a
mandate
or
a
direction.
that's
what
it
always
implied
to
me
and
certainly,
you
wouldn't
be
making
inquiries
of
that
kind
as
defense
counsel,
did
your
command,
did
your
mandate
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
no.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
there
was
none,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
i
--
i'd
like
to
definitely
pinpoint
this
to
the
court
at
this
time
if
i
may
because
the
government
in
the
lower
court
that
is
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
notice
again
in
their
brief
that
they
talk
about
the
defendant
having
been
booked
at
3:45
and
4:15
on
the
afternoon
of
january
10th,
1957
in
police
headquarters.
now,
frankly,
i
think
that
their
reading
of
the
record,
probably
in
the
first
instance
they
were
justified
in
drawing
that
deduction
but
if
they
had
gone
further
in
golombeck's
testimony,
they
would
have
readily
have
seen
that
when
it
was
called
to
golombeck's
attention
relative
to
the
3:45
and
4:15
being
on
the
book
in
the
detective
bureau
that
he
practically
admitted
that
he
was
in
error
and
that
officer
klenk's
testimony
was
correct
and
just
to
pinpoint
that
to
the
court,
i
would
respectfully
refer
you
to
page
81
of
the
record.
you
will
note
that
right
at
the
top
of
it,
“and
you
held
him
on
suspicion
until
1:00
o'clock
or
10
minutes
to
1:00
january
11th,
1957?”
answer
-
“yes,
sir.”
then
of
course
i
asked
this
next
question
and
i
could
never
understand
the
ruling
of
the
court,
but
i
think
the
court
will
appreciate
it,
but
now,
in
keeping
with
the
continuity
of
the
expression
that
i
made,
i
would
like
to
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
next
page.
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
the
second
last
question.
“the
charge
was
placed
against
this
man
on
the
afternoon
of
the
10th,
the
day
of
the
arrest?”
answer
-
“not
the
charge
of
robbery,
it
was
placed
on
the
11th.”
now,
that
was
direct
examination
by
mr.
fallon,
the
district
attorney.
you'll
note
that
from
page
81
and
then
golombeck
testified
somewhat
to
the
contrary,
your
honors,
on
page
91
of
the
record
and
at
this
particular
time,
he
was
being
examined
by
mr.
fallon.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
91.
this
is
officer
klenk
again
who
--
whose
testimony
i
just
referred
to
at
page
82.
the
first
question
at
the
top
of
the
page,
your
honor,
is
i'm
now
examining
now
as
to
exhibit
41
which
is
police
blotter.
“does
this
time
indicate
on
here
under
this
time
column,
does
that
indicate
the
time
that
they
were
brought
down
from
the
cell
block
and
officially
put
on
the
memorandum
of
arrests
on
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day?”
answer
-
“yes.”
“then
the
time
in
here
has
an
indication
as
to
when
they
were
brought
into
thee?”
the
answer
-
“detective
bureau.”
detective
bureau
answered,
that's
right.
“and
that
indicates
the
time
of
their
arrival
at
the
detective
bureau?”
“yes
sir.”
now,
just
to
--
i
notice
my
time
is
running
short,
at
page
97
for
reference
to
the
court,
you'll
find
that
golombeck
at
that
particular
time
--
i
should've
said
page
99,
your
honor.
question
about
the
second
third
--
second
last
question
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
in
this
particular
case,
we
have
testimony
here
to
the
effect
that
is
the
time
they
were
brought
from
the
cell
block
into
the
detective
bureau.
well
then,
it
must
be
so.
he
contracted
what
he
had
said
on
page
97.
now,
in
answer
to
justice
to
frankfurter's
query,
may
i
say
this?
in
answer
to
your
question
which
i
understood
to
be
that
“would
that
evidence
be
admissible
by
state
officers
in
the
state
courts
of
new
york
state?
that
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
--
i
think
i
got
it.
thank
you.
in
as
much
as
we
do
not
follow
the
exclusionary
rule
as
you
well
know
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
--
people
against
(inaudible),
which
is
very
familiar
to
yourself
and
other
kindred
cases.
but
i
would
say
that
if
this
testimony
had
been
introduced
in
the
state
courts
of
new
york
state
that
my
objection
to
it
certainly
would
have
been
overruled.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
before.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
if
your
honor
please,
i
--
i
think
i
can
answer
it
this
way.
investigation
without
anything
being
designated
as
to
investigation
--
but
then
again
on
the
11th,
the
redlinski
charge
came
into
being
because
an
information
was
filed
in
the
city
court
of
buffalo.
to
this
day,
there
hasn't
been
anything
done
by
the
local
authorities
including
golombeck,
klenk,
and
others
as
to
that
redlinski
charge
and
that's
supposedly
occurred
in
1957
in
january
and
here
it
is,
1961.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
yes.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
i
found
that
to
be
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
in
what?
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
well,
i
know.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
no
warrant
of
arrest.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
but
it's
just
loose
talk
on
the
part
of
those
police
officers
that,
you
know,
they're
talking
a
certain
type
of
jargon
and
you
can't
control
them,
but
i
would
say
that
if
that
was
definitely
loose
talk
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
very
definite
and
they've
set
convictions
aside
our
court
of
appeals.
people
against
lovello,
the
mummiani
case
is
and
other
one
where
they
have
set
it
aside
because
of
a
failure
to
arraign
promptly
in
violation
of
section
165
of
the
code.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
failure
to
obey
does
lead
them
to
set
aside
the
conviction.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
i
think,
your
honor,
in
view
of
what
our
court
of
appeals
has
said
that
there
definitely
would
be
a
reversal
if
this
testimony
were
allowed
to
be
introduced
in
state
court
and
merely
because
of
the
violation
on
the
part
of
the
police
officers
in
detaining
illegally.
that's
my
thinking
concerning
our
court
of
appeals.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
that's
true.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
well,
we
have
a
section
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
yes,
we
have.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor.
that
--
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
it's
true.
it
is.
thank
you.
mr.
william
b.
mahoney
no
reply
your
honor.
thank
you.
