mr.
howard
a.
heffron
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
anderson
case
was
decided
at
the
same
time
as
in
mcnabb
decision
came
down
and
as
we
see
it,
the
rule
of
the
anderson
case
is
a
corollary
of
the
mcnabb
principle.
and
that
anderson,
in
effect
says
that
federal
agents
may
not
do
indirectly
through
a
state
investigation
what
they
could
not
do
directly.
so
that
as
we
see
it,
the
search
under
the
anderson
principle
is
to
find
culpable
conduct
by
federal
agents;
such
conduct
which
would
warrant
this
court
in
finding
that
they
had
deliberately
violated
the
rules
of
federal
procedure
in
a
situation
in
which
they
had
sufficient
control
and
power
to
adhere
to
those
rules.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
it
would.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no,
we
would
not
insist
that
that
is
a
test.
now,
in
this
case,
what
we
have
is
a
bank
robbery
which
was
at
the
same
time
a
state
crime
as
well
as
a
federal
crime.
there's
no
doubt
that
both
sets
of
authorities
were
interested
in
solving
this
bank
robbery.
the
f.
b.
i.
had
an
informant
who
was
in
communication
with
this
defendant
and
who
made
various
submissions
to
the
informant
which
were
duly
conveyed
to
the
f.
b.
i.
and
the
investigation
proceeded.
there
came
a
time
in
the
course
of
this
investigation
when
the
informant
advised
the
f.
b.
i.
that
the
petitioner
and
his
accomplices
were
planning
a
state
offense,
the
robbery
of
a
tavern
in
buffalo.
now,
at
that
point,
the
f.
b.
i.
investigation
had
not
yet
been
completed.
they
still
had
an
informant
in
contact
with
this
petitioner
and
they
were
receiving
reports
of
--
of
a
nature
which
interested
them.
there
were
various
accomplices
named.
at
one
time,
the
informant
reported
that
he'd
been
told
that
a
man
named
jimmy
had
been
involved
in
the
liberty
bank
robbery
with
no
further
identification.
so
there
was
good
reason
for
the
investigation
to
continue.
then
the
f.
b.
i.
learned
through
its
informant
of
the
--
of
a
projected
state
crime
and
they
faced
a
dilemma.
their
investigation,
they
decided,
should
continue,
at
least
they're
not
willing
to
bring
it
to
an
end
at
this
time.
they
have
an
informant.
they're
receiving
information
of
value
to
them.
on
the
other
hand,
a
state
crime
is
about
to
be
committed.
under
these
circumstances,
they
had
no
choice
but
to
convey
this
information
to
the
state
authority
so
that
the
state
authorities
could
then
make
--
take
appropriate
action
to
prevent
this
robbery
of
a
tavern
from
being
accomplished.
that's
precisely
what
happened
here.
the
f.
b.
i.
in
the
course
of
its
investigation
ascertained
information
about
an
independent
state
crime
unrelated
in
any
way
to
the
federal
crime
which
was
under
investigation.
and
as
part
of
their
responsibility,
they
felt
they
had
to
convey
this
information
to
the
state
police.
when
the
state
police
received
this
information,
they
apprehended
coppola.
now,
there's
some
question
as
to
legality
of
the
arrest.
the
--
the
chief
of
police
of
buffalo
testified
that
before
he
apprehended
this
petitioner,
that
he
had
been
advised
by
one
redlinski
that
the
petitioner
was
the
man
who
robbed
his
butcher
store,
that
he
had
shown
redlinski
a
photograph
of
petitioner,
redlinski
and
identified
him.
when
the
car
was
stopped
and
the
police
officers
searched
the
car,
under
the
seat
they
found
not
only
the
keys
referred
to
by
mr.
mahoney,
but
silk
stockings.
silk-stocking
was
as
the
mask
used
by
the
bank
robbers
in
the
m.
&
t.
bank
job.
now,
having
the
prisoners
in
custody,
the
state
police
then
removed
them
to
the
jail
in
the
city.
now,
up
to
this
point,
we
say,
we
have
nothing
more
than
a
normal
kind
of
police
cooperation.
the
f.
b.
i.
has
information
about
a
state
crime.
they
feel
they
must
turn
this
information
over
to
the
state
police.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
no,
there's
nothing
here.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
as
we
see
it,
there
is
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that's
right.
there
is
no
problem
at
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
this
point.
now,
then
these
men
are
brought
in
--
are
brought
to
a
police
headquarters
and
the
state
police
interrogate
them
about
various
state
crimes,
about
these
bank
robberies.
the
f.
b.
i.
requests
permission
to
interrogate
the
man
and
they
are
told
when
we're
ready
in
effect.
and
when
we're
ready
means
in
this
case
at
9:00
in
the
evening
which
is
when
the
f.
b.
i.
were
finally
permitted
access
to
interrogate
this
man
uninterrupted.
now,
up
until
that
time,
the
man
was
in
control
of
the
state
police.
he
was
being
held
on
charges
of
an
independent
state
crime.
he
had
been
arrested
by
state
police
pursuant
to
these
charges.
there's
no
suggestion
in
the
record
that
this
arrest
was
anything
other
than
that
which
it
appeared
to
be,
an
arrest
on
independent
state
offense.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
can
advise
the
court
that
on
january
23rd,
an
indictment
was
returned
in
the
state
court
in
buffalo
charging
this
petitioner
with
the
redlinski
robbery,
which
was
the
one
the
chief
of
police
had
had
the
victim
identify
petitioner
prior
to
the
apprehension
of
these
men.
that
indictment
still
subsists
and
there's
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
there's
been
no
trial
under
it.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
that
is
the
butcher
shop
robbery.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
of
1957.
it
was
13
days
after
they
had
apprehended.
now,
it's
--
was
stipulated
below
that
the
interviews
which
the
f.
b.
i.
had
with
the
petitioner
did
not
delay
his
arraignment
under
state
law.
those
interviews
took
place
in
the
evening
and
that
the
--
the
counsel
agreed
below
that
it
was
impossible
to
arraign
the
man
until
the
following
morning.
so
what
we
have
here
is
an
arrest
of
a
man
for
an
independent
state
crime.
he
is
taken
into
custody
by
state
police.
when
they
are
permitted
by
state
police,
the
f.
b.
i.
interviewed
the
man.
thereafter,
on
the
following
day,
he
is
arraigned
for
his
state
crime
and
just
as
soon
as
he
is
released
to
federal
agents,
he
is
arraigned
promptly
on
his
federal
crime.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i'm
not
sure
i
--
i
understand
--
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
they
talked
to
him
at
--
from
9:00
o'clock
in
the
evening
until
midnight
or
past
midnight.
he
was
arraigned
the
following
day
at
about
one
o'clock
in
the
afternoon.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
and
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that's
right.
at
--
at
10
o'clock
in
the
morning,
following
this
evening
of
interrogation,
a
complaint
was
filed
before
the
united
states
commissioner
charging
coppola
with
the
--
with
the
bank
robbery.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
there
was
none.
the
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
if
you
--
if
you
assume
the
arrest
took
place
that
evening
which
was
not
the
case
here.
in
fact,
in
this
case,
the
police
officers
apprehended
this
man
approximately
9:45
in
the
morning
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
of
that
day.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
the
relation
was
one
where
the
f.
b.
i.
had
supplied
information
which
led
to
this
man's
arrest.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
and
they
awaited
an
opportunity
to
interview
the
prisoner.
they
requested
permission
to
interview
the
prisoner
and
they
finally
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that
same
day.
they
were
finally
granted
permission
at
8:00
o'clock
that
night.
now
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
they
had
lunch
with
the
state
officers.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no,
they
did
not.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
they
did.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
but
did
they
actually
come
into
his
presence
and
--
and
began
to
talk
with
him?
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
there
is
one
occasion
at
3:30
in
the
afternoon
when
the
f.
b.
i.
agent
roche
and
the
district
attorney
dwyer
jointly
saw
petitioner.
the
testimony
is
that
roche
asked
for
permission
to
search
the
petitioner's
apartment
and
the
petitioner,
at
first
agreed,
whereupon
roche
left
to
get
a
form
of
consent
for
the
petitioner
to
sign.
when
he
returned
with
the
form,
petitioner
said,
“i'd
rather
not
sign
this.”
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
“i'd
rather
not
sign
this
form”
and
that
was
the
end
of
that
interview.
now,
the
next
occasion
that
the
f.
b.
i.
has
any
contact
with
the
man
is
at
9:00
o'clock
that
night.
they
had
arrived
at
police
headquarters
at
8:00
and
requested
permission
to
interview
the
man.
he
was
then
out
in
a
lineup
where
various
victims
had
been
called
in
to
identify
him.
he
did
not
return
until
9:00
o'clock.
there's
no
question
that
at
this
--
during
this
entire
period,
the
custody
was
that
of
the
state's.
this
was
--
this
took
place
at
police
headquarters.
when
the
f.
b.
i.
requested
permission
to
interview
them,
they
had
to
wait.
the
detective
--
the
--
the
city
detective
klenk
testified
that
he
had
come
in
to
try
and
take
the
man
away
for
a
show-up.
while
the
f.
b.
i.
were
interviewing
them,
he
did
not
out
of
courtesy.
he
said
they
were
my
prisoners,
i
could
have
taken
them
if
i
had
wanted
to.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
the
city
detective.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no,
i
would
not.
this
maybe
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
subsequent
to
his
arraignment
on
the
state
charges,
he
was
turned
over
to
united
states
marshals.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
subsequent,
yes,
and
brought
before
the
united
states
commissioner
that
afternoon.
there
is
no
contention
here
that
there
was
any
delay
in
that
period.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
the
only
statements
that
are
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
offered
here
were
in
the
evening
session.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
we
assume
that
the
f.
b.
i.
arrested
this
man
at
9:45
in
the
morning
and
did
not
arraign
him
until
the
following
afternoon.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
that's
right.
that
is
not
--
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
there
is
no
question
that
mr.
roche
wanted
an
opportunity
for
the
f.
b.
i.
to
interview
this
man.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
he
went
over
there
to
find
out
precisely
what
had
happened.
find
out,
i
presume,
whether
or
not
the
defendant
had
already
made
statements
relating
to
these
bank
robberies.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
the
record
only
--
it
only
appears
in
the
record
that
he
was
interested
in
finding
out
what
had
occurred
or
what
developments
took
place.
now,
there
--
there
are
many
differences
between
this
case
and
the
anderson
case.
we've
attempted
an
exhaustive
analysis
of
the
anderson
record
and
we've
made
references
in
our
brief.
the
differences
are
many
in
--
in
our
view
of
decisive
importance
here.
in
anderson,
it
was
a
joint
investigation
of
the
same
crime,
blowing
up
of
the
tva
lines
which
was
both
a
federal
offense
and
a
state
offense,
a
joint
investigation
of
the
same
crime
which
resulted
in
the
detention
which
was
allegedly
unlawful.
in
anderson,
the
arrest
and
detention
were
admittedly
for
the
purpose
of
investigating
the
very
crime
upon
which
the
f.
b.
i.
was
working
together
with
the
state
police.
here,
the
arrest
and
detention
were
in
connection
with
an
unrelated
state
offense.
in
anderson,
the
detention
was
for
the
purpose
of
permitting
the
f.
b.
i.
to
interrogate
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
in
this
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
the
butcher
robbery
as
well
as
the
--
the
alleged
conspiracy
to
rob
a
tavern
which
was
thwarted
when
--
when
these
men
were
apprehended
by
the
city
police.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
any
--
anything
other
than
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
well
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
well,
there
is
a
card,
a
booking
card
which
is
filled
out
when
a
prisoner
arrives
at
--
at
the
detective
headquarters
portion
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
of
the
jail.
that
card
shows
under
charge,
it
has
a
--
it
has
a
--
an
appropriate
heading
charge
and
it
shows
the
butcher
robbery
as
well
as
another
crime,
an
unrelated
straight
--
state
crime
of
burglary
in
niagara
falls.
now,
there
is
some
dispute
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
pardon.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
it
--
the
references
to
it
appear
at
different
portions
of
the
record
and
they're
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
there
is
some
question
about
that
as
mr.
mahoney
indicates.
a
police
officer
klenk
testified
that
the
charges
were
placed
against
the
man
on
the
11th
rather
than
the
10th.
i
--
i
think
from
a
--
a
fair
reading
of
the
record
indicates
that
the
officer
was
confused
as
to
whether
the
--
the
question
or
meant
by
charge,
simply
the
state
court
or
the
state
police's
allegation
of
a
charge
which
appeared
on
the
card
or
the
formal
charge
in
court.
the
chief
of
police
testified
at
one
point
that
the
--
the
charge
that
he
directed,
that
the
charge
be
placed
upon
the
card
that
afternoon.
so
there
is
a
conflict
here.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
the
card
itself
indicates
with
particularity
two
separate
and
distinct
charges,
one
for
robbery
and
one
for
burglary.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
the
card
is
in
exhibit
and
i
assume
that's
with
the
clerk.
that's
government
exhibit
41
and
at
the
time
when
the
chief
of
police
testified,
he
was
asked
whether
he
would
explain
about
the
card
and
he
says
--
it
shows
--
this
is
at
record
84,
it
shows
on
january
10th,
1957
at
3:45
p.m.,
he
was
booked,
gave
the
address,
the
name,
so
and
so,
can
read
and
write,
charges
2124
of
the
penal
law.
“what
is
that?”
“robbery”
“and
does
it
show
the
complainant?”
“yes.”
“who
was
it?”
“paul
redlinski.”
then
later
on
january
10th,
at
4:15
he
was
booked
on
the
charge
of
404,
the
penal
law
or
burglary
and
the
third
degree
felony
on
the
complaint
of
albert
zydel.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
in
terms
of
the
testimony
which
was
developed
at
the
preliminary
hearing
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
the
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well
the
trial
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
oh,
i
would
say
over
1000
pages
clearly.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
but
i
would
say
this
that
the
bulk
of
the
testimony
at
the
hearings
which
pertained
to
the
issue
of
the
illegal
detention
and
admissibility
of
confession
by
far,
virtually
all
of
that
is
in
the
printed
record.
the
remainder
of
the
transcript
relates
to
the
actual
testimony
at
the
trial
relating
to
the
petitioner's
participation
in
the
robbery.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
the
testimony
at
the
trial
was
--
was
actually
a
duplicate
of
what
took
place
at
the
preliminary
hearings.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
we
know
of
nothing
different
in
that
transcript.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
now,
i
was
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
going
on
with
the
difference
between
the
anderson
case
and
this
case.
in
anderson,
there
is
testimony
that
the
sheriff
told
the
f.
b.
i.
that
his
informant
and
that
was
a
state
informant,
in
anderson.
that
--
that
the
following
named
men
were
implicated
in
the
--
in
the
blasting.
and
that
he
intended
to
bring
them
in
for
the
f.
b.
i.
to
interview.
and
there
is
testimony
that
the
f.
b.
i.
agent
said,
“we
concur
to
that
extent.”
it's
clear
from
the
anderson
record
that
the
purpose
of
arresting
the
man
and
the
purpose
of
detaining
them
was
so
that
the
f.
b.
i.
could
interview
them.
in
the
anderson
case,
it
is
also
clear
that
it
was
the
f.
b.
i.
interrogation
which
caused
the
length
of
the
detention.
there,
as
i've
said
before,
the
arrest
was
for
the
purpose
of
permitting
the
f.
b.
i.
to
interview
these
men
and
they,
in
fact,
did
almost
all
the
interviewing.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
believe
it
went
six
days.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
sir.
now,
in
substance
then,
as
we
see
it
in
the
anderson
case,
the
investigations
of
both
the
state
and
the
f.
b.
i.
had
so
fused
that
it
was
appropriate
to
--
to
charge
the
f.
b.
i.
for
the
failure
to
arraign
these
men.
they
had
as
much
control
in
effect
over
them.
they
benefited
by
the
detention.
the
detention
was
brought
about
so
that
they
could
interview
the
men.
it
was
proper
under
all
the
circumstances
to
charge
the
f.
b.
i.
with
the
--
with
the
failure,
failures
of
the
state
police
who
had
formal
custody
to
arraign
these
men.
and
by
the
--
by
the
citation
in
the
anderson
opinion,
particularly
the
byars
case,
which
in
effect
held
that
where
the
investigation
is
joint
and
the
federal
agents
participate
in
the
illegality,
the
--
the
acts
must
be
treated
as
if
the
federal
agents
had
performed
them
solely
by
themselves.
we
say
we
don't
have
that
sort
of
case
here
at
all.
we
have
the
f.
b.
i.
investigating
this
man
and
in
the
course
of
their
investigation,
they
receive
information
of
an
independent,
unrelated
state
crime
which
is
about
to
be
committed.
they
have
no
alternative
even
though
it
may
jeopardize
their
investigation,
even
though
an
arrest
by
state
police
here
will
cut
off
the
source
of
their
information
because
their
informant
will
no
longer
have
access,
even
though
it
may
run
directly
contrary
to
their
own
interest
in
finding
out
the
names
of
additional
accomplices,
a
place
where
the
--
the
money
may
have
been
hidden,
where
the
firearms
are.
even
though
it
may
have
run
contrary
to
all
these
interests,
there
is
no
alternative
under
the
circumstances
but
to
advise
the
police
in
order
to
--
to
postulate
that
that
kind
of
cooperation
is
the
kind
of
working
arrangement
which
this
court
condemned
in
anderson,
we
say
is
just
not
correct.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
we
have
assumed
that
it
was
illegal
under
new
york
law
in
our
brief.
now,
this
matter
with
respect
to
the
working
arrangement,
this
issue
is
an
issue
which
was
resolved
against
the
petitioner
by
two
district
judges
and
four
circuit
judges.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i'm
--
i
just
--
i
don't
know.
i
didn't
anticipate
in
having
the
record
on
appeal
brought
before
this
court.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
at
9:00
p.m.,
i
take
it.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
9:00
p.m.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
--
i
would
say
that
would
depend
on
other
circumstances
whether
the
commissioner
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
was
--
was
available
at
some
point.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
don't
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
there
have
to
be
more
facts.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
mr.
chief
justice,
on
the
question
of
whether
the
new
york
state
courts
would
exclude
these
confessions
if
this
had
been
a
state
prosecution,
our
understanding
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
not
adopted
any
exclusionary
rule,
but
on
the
contrary,
it
has
expressly
held
that
it
is
not
bound
by
the
mallory
decision
and
will
not
adopt
a
similar
exclusionary
rule.
so
it
is
our
understanding
that
these
confessions
would
be
admissible
in
a
state
trial.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
know
of
no
jurisdiction
which
has
adopted
a
rule
similar
to
the
mcnabb-mallory
principle.
wharton's
criminal
evidence,
the
most
recent
edition,
states
with
respect
to
the
mcnabb
principle,
that
following
the
adoption
of
the
federal
rule,
the
state
courts
have
generally
either
expressly
rejected
it
or
ignored
it.
and
we
know
of
no
state
jurisdiction
which
has
held
that
a
confession
must
be
excluded
where
it
was
procured
during
a
detention
illegal
under
state
law.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
see.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
we
have
--
we
have
assumed
in
our
brief
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
delay
was
illegal
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
that
this
man
should
have
been
arraigned.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that's
right.
new
york
--
new
york
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
new
york
statute
uses
the
same
language
as
a
federal
rule,
unnecessary
delay.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
we
have
assumed
that
the
delay
here
was
illegal.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
i
believe
they
did.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
particular
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
as
we
understand
it,
there
is
no
distinction
taken
in
the
new
york
cases
between
a
willful
violation
or
some
other
violation.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
expressly
refused
to
adopt
an
exclusionary
principle
similar
to
the
mcnabb
rule.
the
court
of
appeals
has
stated
that
the
legal
nature
of
the
detention
is
a
factor
which
maybe
considered
in
connection
with
all
the
other
circumstances.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
is
not
itself
a
reason
for
excluding
a
confession
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no,
no.
so
far
as
we
know,
no.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
it
is
our
understanding
that
there
is
no
such
rule.
new
york
court
has
indicated
that
where
a
request
to
charge
is
made
which
request
the
trial
judge
to
charge
that
there
was
an
illegal
detention
here
and
that
that
delay,
an
illegality
in
the
detention
maybe
considered
along
with
all
the
other
factors
in
the
case
has
bearing
on
the
issue
of
voluntariness,
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
such
a
charge
should
be
given
where
it
is
requested.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
there
--
yes,
sir
on
page
43
of
our
brief.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
that's
correct.
now,
the
second
point
which
petitioner
makes
here
is
one
which
assumes
that
there
was
no
working
arrangement,
no
cooperation,
no
joint
investigation
here
such
as
would
under
the
anderson
case,
require
exclusion
of
the
confession.
this
point
urges
that
even
though
there
been
--
there
has
been
no
such
cooperation
that
nevertheless
the
court
ought
to
hold
that
the
confessions
are
inadmissible.
now,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
basis
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
for
such
a
result.
under
that
hypothesis,
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
is
inapplicable.
federal
agents
have
not
disobeyed
the
mandate
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
they
have
done
nothing
wrong
at
all.
they
have
taken
the
prisoner
as
they
found
him
and
they
have
interviewed
him.
there's
no
basis
for
the
application
of
the
mcnabb
restriction.
the
court
has
--
in
dealing
with
evidence
of
this
kind,
this
court
has
never
excluded
this
kind
of
evidence
unless
an
exclusion
was
an
implementation
of
a
federal
constitutional
command,
statutory
or
rule
of
procedure.
none
of
these
is
involved
here.
petitioner
does
not
claim
that
he
was
deprived
of
any
constitutional
rights.
he
does
claim
that
he
was
--
that
his
detention
violated
a
state
rule
of
procedure
and
that
would
be
the
basis
upon
which
he
asked
the
court
to
proceed.
now
the
court
has
never
excluded
evidence
of
this
kind
absent
of
violation
of
a
federal
constitutional
command,
statute
or
rule
of
procedure.
none
of
those
are
involved
here.
the
general
rule
at
common
law
and
as
i've
indicated
in
all
of
the
state
jurisdictions
has
been
that
a
confession
is
nonetheless
admissible
despite
any
illegality
in
the
detention
which
preceded
it.
the
test
is
one
of
voluntariness.
the
illegal
custody
maybe
a
factor
in
determining
whether
the
confession
was
voluntary,
but
no
state
jurisdiction
has
gone
beyond
that.
and
indeed
as
we
understand
it,
the
rule
in
this
court
prior
to
mcnabb,
the
general
common
law
rule
on
confessions
was
that
a
confession
is
inadmissible
even
if
it
is
made
while
the
prisoner
is
in
custody
so
long
as
it
is
voluntary
and
meets
the
test
of
voluntariness
and
there's
no
issue
here
of
voluntariness.
that
question
was
not
even
raised
below.
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury
and
resolved
against
petitioner.
he
did
not
raise
it
in
the
court
of
appeals.
he
does
not
raise
it
here.
so
this
confession
qualifies
as
admissible
under
the
rules
of
all
the
states
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
under
the
general
common
law
principle
regarding
admissibility
of
confessions
which
this
court
had
--
had
adhered
to
prior
to
the
mcnabb
rule.
now,
if
the
circumstances
do
not
call
for
application
of
the
mcnabb
rule,
that
is
if
there
is
no
finding
here
that
federal
officers
in
--
in
someway
were
involved
with
the
illegality
and
therefore
should
be
disciplined
by
--
by
an
exclusion
here,
there's
no
basis
as
we
see
it
upon
which
to
exclude
this
confession.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that
is
--
that's
right.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
think
that's
what
it
did
say.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
i
believe
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that
is
our
point
here.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that
is
correct.
that
is
as
we
see
this
case.
the
petitioner
has
raised
this
point
though
and
we
are
trying
to
deal
with
it
as
best
we
can.
if
you
eliminate
the
factor
of
federal
cooperation
to
constitute
a
working
arrangement
within
anderson,
you
eliminate
the
basis
for
any
rule
of
exclusion
as
it
has
been
applied
by
this
court.
the
court
has
stated
that
the
--
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
rule
of
exclusion
is
to
prevent
and
not
to
repair.
now,
a
rule
of
exclusion
here
would
not
serve
any
useful
purpose
by
hypothesis
on
this
branch
of
the
argument.
federal
agents
have
done
nothing
wrong.
if
anything
illegal
has
been
done,
it's
been
done
by
state
officials
who
have
been
engaged
in
investigating
an
independent
state
crime.
a
rule
of
exclusion
here
would
not
serve
to
encourage
state
police
to
adhere
to
their
own
local
rules
of
procedure
on
the
possibility
that
during
their
investigation
of
an
unrelated
state
crime,
a
confession
to
a
federal
offense
might
be
obtained
from
the
prisoner
which
would
be
admissible
in
the
state
court,
but
which
would
not
be
admissible
in
the
federal
court
under
the
extension
of
mcnabb
proposed
here
by
petitioner.
that
would
be
a
sanction
but
it
would
produce
no
desirable
effect.
it
would
not
be
disciplining
the
state
police
and
since
by
hypothesis,
the
federal
agents
here
have
done
nothing
wrong.
it
would
not
serve
any
useful
function
with
respect
to
them.
once
you
eliminate
mcnabb
and
once
you
eliminate
any
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights,
we
say
that
the
court
is
thrown
back
on
the
usual
rule
which
applies
to
confessions,
a
rule
which
the
states
have
applied
and
which
this
court
applied
before
it
promulgated
the
mcnabb
rule
as
a
means
to
enforce
the
mandate
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
when
you
resort
to
the
normal
common
law
rules
of
evidence
here
which
all
the
state
applied
as
far
as
we
can
tell
and
which
this
court
applied
prior
to
mcnabb,
the
only
basis
upon
which
this
confession
maybe
excluded
is
that
it
was
involuntary
and
there
is
no
contention
that
it
was
involuntary
here.
that
being
so
as
we
see
it,
there
is
no
basis
upon
which
the
confession
can
be
excluded.
it
was
properly
admitted.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
my
information,
i
gather,
was
not
as
current
as
that.
as
far
as
i
could
tell
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
but
if
i
may
summarize
on
this
branch
of
the
argument,
absent
involvement
by
federal
officers
the
reason
for
applying
a
mcnabb-mallory
rule
of
exclusion
is
not
present.
there
is
no
basis
upon
which
to
apply
the
sanction
if
there
has
been
no
unlawful
conduct
which
is
designed
to
punish.
and
under
the
normal
rules
of
evidence,
a
confession
is
admissible
even
though
it
is
obtained
while
a
prisoner
is
held
in
custody
providing
that
it
meets
all
the
tests
of
voluntariness.
a
confession
here
does
meet
those
tests
and
therefore
we
say
it
was
properly
admissible
and
there's
no
basis
in
the
mcnabb
rule
to
exclude
it.
