do
you
think
that's
a
term
--
do
you
think
that
as
a
term
of
art
of
working
arrangement?
do
you
think
that's
a
technical
phrase
mr.
--
senator
mahoney?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
a
colloquial
phrase
which
relates
to
a
set
of
circumstances
to
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
demonstrated
in
each
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
a
litmus
paper
test,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
the
two
cases
cited
after
the
phrase
working
arrangement
or
a
few
words
after
by
as
the
gambino
indicates
what
was
meant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
say
the
gambino
case
and
the
byars
case
cited
for
and
used
the
following
sentence
using
the
phrase
“working
arraignment”
indicates
what
is
meant
by
working
arrangement,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
won't
you
--
won't
you
go
beyond
--
all
that
i
was
suggesting,
senator
mahoney
is
that
working
arrangement
isn't
a
talismanic
phrase.
justice
felix
frankfurter
senator
mahoney,
all
--
all
words
are
rather
sharp
instruments.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
avoid
them
--
avoid
that.
would
you
accept
in
order
to
get
the
case
out
of
the
atmosphere
of
--
of
insisting
it
in
--
into
that
phrase
and
don't
--
were
a
binding
phrase,
would
you
accept
the
colloquial
phrase
that
the
two
sets
of
officials
were
partners
in
this
enterprise
with
the
power
and
responsibility
that
the
partners
had
or
the
power
of
control
that
the
partners
had.
justice
felix
frankfurter
should
you
accept
that
as
the
colloquial
way
of
trying
to
express
the
same
idea
that
lay
behind
that
phrase,
in
the
context
of
the
anderson
case?
i
don't
mean
to
be
--
introduce
this
by
saying
that
all
words
are
treacherous,
but
that's
the
--
that's
the
idea
of
a
working
arrangement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
that
while
somebody's
in
complete
control
of
somebody
else
he
had
lead
to
somebody
else
to
talk
to
and
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
--
from
the
--
what
i
call
partners
being
active
companions
in
a
common
enterprise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
does
or
doesn't
come
within
the
phrase.
i'm
just
trying
to
rip
any
technical
connotations
out
of
the
phrase.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
--
when
you
use
language
like
that,
you
imply
as
--
you
imply
responsibility
on
the
part
of
federal
officials,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
implied
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
it
isn't
by
grace
of
the
state
authority
were
they're
allowed
to
do
something
but
they
had
a
responsible,
active
controlling
share.
that's
part
of
your
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
senator
mahoney,
either
now
or
later,
i
don't
want
to
break
into
your
argument,
before
you
sit
down,
will
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
us
whether
these
disclosures
made
by
the
defendants,
whether
they
would
have
been
admitted,
whether
they
were
admissible
in
case
these
people
had
been
tried
for
a
state
offense,
just
take
your
(inaudible),
the
arrest
of
--
whether
--
whether
under
new
york
state
law,
there
were
illegalities
on
the
part
of
the
state
law
enforcement
officials
which
would
have
led
to
the
exclusion
of
this
same
testimony
in
a
state
proceeding
--
just
when
you
get
around
to
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
and
i
--
i
assume
and
knew
there
was
--
judge
cardozo's
opinion
before
--
before
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
and
you
referred
to
page
82,
senator
mahoney.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
charges
were
faced
against
number
10?
answer
-
“investigation.”
is
that
loose
talk
or
is
there
really
under
in
new
york
practice
as
a
man
--
his
investigation
or
charge
under
which
a
man
is
held?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
that
common
practice
just
to
put
down
investigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
to
--
and
to
call
any
charge,
sounds
a
little
odd,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
an
investigation
is
called
a
charge
that
was
at
large.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
warrant
of
arrest
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
warrant
of
arrest,
no
charge,
it's
just
an
investigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
while
your
--
while
the
court
of
appeals
--
while
you
haven't
got
the
exclusionary
rules,
they
have
from
time
to
time
and
sets
things
about
this,
the
court
of
appeals.
it
is
large
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
well,
is
your
answer
saying
that
the
evidence
would
not
be
excluded
also
covers
that
they
--
the
question
whether
failure
to
obey
the
statute
leads
them
to
set
aside
the
conviction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
i'll
repeat
my
question.
in
this
case,
would
failure
to
arraign
--
what
would
be
the
effect
of
the
failure
to
arraign?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
little
difficult
of
--
there
and
--
for
me
to
reconcile
that
with
the
general
rule
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
mere
fact
of
the
evidence
is
obtained
from
the
circumstances
of
--
it
pursues
him
illegal
or
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
now
have
a
search
and
seizure
provision,
haven't
you,
in
new
york?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
now,
evidence
may
be
procured
in
violation
of
the
search
and
seizure
provision
of
the
state
constitution,
but
that
would
not
exclude
the
evidence,
but
failure
to
arraign
in
time
might
lead
to
a
reversal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
little
difficult
to
reconcile.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
culpable,
we
get
into
trouble
sometimes,
we
use
moral
terms.
all
they
have
to
do
on
the
mcnabb
and
anderson
is
not
obey
the
requirement
of
prompt
arraignment.
they
may
be
--
they
may
not
--
they
may
be
zealous,
they
maybe
high
minded,
they
may
have
not
thought
about
it,
and
they
just
fail
to
arraign
him
for
several
days.
that
would
exclude
the
statements,
wouldn't
it
under
mcnabb?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
when
you
say
culpable,
you
introduce
an
element
of
--
of
moral
responsibility
that
isn't
required.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
--
it
may
accompany
to
transaction
but
it
isn't
a
test.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
up
to
this
time,
doesn't
anything
that
calls
for
interpretation.
up
to
this
time,
you
haven't
gotten
anything
yet
insofar
as
the
federal
benefit
of
the
--
of
the
arrangement,
whatever
arrangement
there
has
been,
have
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
there's
no
problem
as
yet.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
much
upon
do
you
--
how
much
time
transpired
--
took
place
between
the
arraignment
either
by
state
or
federal
--
under
state
or
a
federal
charge
other
than
the
investigation
--
arraignment
i'm
talking
about.
how
much
time
elapsed
between
disclosures
made
by
them,
talk
subsequently
used
in
the
federal
trial
and
the
arraignment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
federal
--
the
f.
b.
i.
people
talk
with
the
petitioner
before
he
was
arraigned.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
much
time
elapsed
between
the
time
that
they
talked
to
him
and
the
time
that
he
was
arraigned?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
--
they
just
intervened
the
night
and
before
noon,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
talk
between
after
the
midnight
talk?
there
was
a
talk
from
9:00
which
terminated
at
12:00.
was
there
any
further
talk
between
the
f.
b.
i.
the
following
fore
noon
which
was
used
in
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
suppose
you
had
--
suppose
all
this
had
taken
place
through
federal
law
enforcement,
through
f.
b.
i.
no
state
federal
problem
intervened,
suppose
he'd
been
arrested
that
day
and
suppose
they
had
questioned
him
from
9:00
to
12:00
and
he'd
been
arraigned
the
next
morning
on
the
mcnabb
would
the
government
not
--
not
use
this,
the
confess
--
the
statements
or
if
they
came
here
with
a
confessed
error.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
that
day?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
was
therefore
the
--
we
have
to
canvas,
i
think
the
relation
of
the
f.
b.
i.
to
the
arrest
and
to
the
condition
into
which
he
was
placed
until
the
f.
b.
i.
began
their
talk
--
investigation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
at
9:00
at
night.
now,
what
was
it,
with
great
particularity?
what
was
the
f.
b.
i.'s
relation
to
the
time
that
he
was
arrested
by
the
state
officials
and
the
talk
began
by
the
f.
b.
i.
at
9:00
at
night?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
antecedent
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
same
day
--
that
same
day?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
have
anything
to
do
except
furnishing
the
information
on
the
basis
of
which
the
state
police
made
the
arrest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
have
anything
to
do
with
the
actual
arrest,
the
physical
arrest?
justice
felix
frankfurter
during
the
course
of
the
day,
did
they
seek
to
talk
to
the
prisoner?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
they
asked
permission
to
talk
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he'd
rather
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
said
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
giving
the
word
control
or
the
conception
of
control
has
looser
the
meaning
as
you
think
is
warranted,
would
you
say
that
anytime
during
the
course
of
that
day,
the
f.
b.
i.
had
control
over
this
person?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
do
you
think
--
at
what
point,
if
ever,
is
any
aspect
of
control
over
the
disposition
of
petitioner
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
arise
in
the
f.
b.
i.?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
at
1:00
o'clock.
what
other
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
was
--
within
that
period,
were
there
any
further
statements
before
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
9:00
to
12:00
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
ask
you
again
whether
if
everything
that
took
place
with
reference
to
the
petitioner
and
the
conduct
of
the
f.
b.
i.,
the
state
were
out
of
it
entirely.
would
the
government
feel
obligated
to
say
yes?
this
is
in
disregard
in
violation
of
mcnabb,
anderson.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
did
they
--
but
you
say
you
can't
assume
that
and
it's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
contrary
to
facts
in
the
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
presume,
does
the
record
shed
any
light
itself?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
heffron,
on
--
you
just
--
in
the
phrase,
the
police
card,
on
page
82,
what
did
the
police
card
say
and
then
the
question,
the
qa
that
i
put
to
senator
mahoney,
“what
charges
were
placed
against
him
on
the
10th?”
answer
-
investigation.
am
i
to
infer
from
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
that
on
this
--
that
the
answer
“investigation”
would
appear
to
be
more
particularized
on
the
police
card,
namely,
that
they
put
down
the
butcher
shop
robbery
and
whatever
it
is,
and
the
other
things.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
state
police
--
the
policeman
here
answered
generally
of
investigation,
that's
what
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
due
course,
it
wasn't
--
find
the
record
as
to
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
the
card?
is
the
card
an
--
as
an
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
heffron,
can
you
tell
(inaudible)
how
many
pages
of
the
stenographic
minutes
of
this
trial
that
has
gone
to
the
clerk
as
against
the
printed
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
whole
of
proceeding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
whole
--
the
whole
proceeding.
how
many
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
stenographic
--
how
many
pages
from
flimsy
papers
are
filed
with
our
clerk
on
the
basis
of
which
this
record
is
made
up
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
over
1000
pages.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
for
all
one
know,
there
maybe
some
reference
as
to
some
of
these
matters
in
the
--
in
the
trial
on
the
merits
to
crop
out
somehow
or
other,
what
they
did
and
what
they
didn't
do,
the
police.
i
suppose
mr.
mahoney
did
all
he
could
to
get
our
cross
examination
what
he
could
get
from
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
makes
it
all
the
more
important,
is
what
took
place?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting.
all
i'm
saying
is
--
unnaturally
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
--
what
was
the
--
the
largest
number
of
hours
of
anyone
of
the
various
defendants
involved
in
anderson?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
f.
b.
i.?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
put
--
may
i
revert
back
to
my
question
about
what
would
have
--
have
happened
if
this
had
been
the
federal
courts
exclusively?
suppose
the
--
suppose
they
had
arrested
the
--
the
petitioner
at
9:00
o'clock
and
they've
questioned
him
until
12:00,
and
had
not
arraigned
them
until
--
arraigned
him
until
10:00
o'clock
next
morning,
they're
still
(inaudible)
facts.
would
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon.
9:00
p.m.
justice
felix
frankfurter
9:00
p.m.,
they
questioned
him
until
12:00,
arraigned
him
at
10:00
o'clock
next
morning.
no
more
than
that.
would
that
be
mcnabb?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
said
just
those
--
or
--
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
it
falls
back,
just
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
there
have
to
be
more
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
new
york
has
the
common
statute
of
requiring
from
the
arraignments
the
--
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
what
consequences
follow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
the
meaning
under
the
--
of
the
new
york
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
heffron,
as
i
--
if
i
correctly
had
heard,
senator
mahoney
very
early
in
his
argument,
or
almost
at
the
beginning,
he
was
interrogated
by
mr.
justice
harlan
and
he
was
asked
whether
he
claimed
that
this
is
a
coerced
confession
case.
and
he
said
quite
clearly
and
unambiguously
the
answer
was
no.
this
is
not
a
coerced
confession
case.
so
then
we've
got
at
--
we've
got
in
any
event
nothing
more
than
some
illegality
under
state
procedure
some
illegality
declared
by
the
state
law.
now,
you
say
in
your
footnote
which
justice
stewart
has
called
attention,
your
courts
have
construed
the
local
arraignment
statute
as
making
--
is
making
it
illegal
for
the
police
officers
to
delay.
you
cite
a
lot
of
cases
of
which
only
one
(inaudible)
is
in
the
next
paragraph
in
which
you
state
in
general
rule
of
new
york,
that
is
illegally
obtained
evidence
is
not
excludable.
what
i
want
to
put
to
you
is
this.
i
don't
want
what
one
would
have
to
--
i
would
have
to
read
all
those
cases
to
find
what
that
means.
it's
illegal.
does
it
that
a
policeman
can
be
put
on
trial
that
he
could
be
disciplined,
that
he
could
be
discharged,
that
he
could
be
sued
for
by
the
individual
who
detained
him
illegally,
etcetera,
etcetera.
at
all
events,
it's
not
of
a
constitu
--
of
--
it's
not
of
a
constitutional
--
as
if
this
is
not
of
significance,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
brings
me
to
the
perkins
case
--
to
the
elkins
case,
you
correct
me
but
i
understood
the
elkins
case
to
stand
for
the
proposition
that
if
what
is
done
in
the
state
proceedings,
if
what
is
done
by
a
state
official
would
if
done
by
federal
officials,
as
constituted
a
breach
to
the
fourth
amendment,
constitutional
violation,
a
violation
of
some
constitutional
right,
it
will
be
so
--
the
evidence
will
be
dealt
with
as
it
would
have
been
if
it
had
been
done
by
the
federal
officials,
is
that
right?
is
that
what
elkin
says?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
standard
is
the
federal
standard
of
constitutional
analogy
on
the
search
and
seizure.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
i
do
not
recall
or
rather
thought
the
opposite
that
the
case
did
not
go
on
the
proposition.
that
if
there
was
conduct
in
securing
evidence,
util
--
sought
to
be
utilized
in
the
federal
courts
who's
violated
a
state
law,
but
not
the
federal
constitution,
that
that
evidence
would
be
excluded
merely
if
the
--
let
me
put
it
clearly
and
squarely,
if
the
federal
--
if
the
federal
prosecution
avails
itself
of
evidence
illegally
secured
by
state
officials,
such
evidence
is
not
excludable
in
the
federal
courts.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
then,
the
mere
fact,
no
matter
what
illegality
may
involve
in
--
under
new
york
law
in
these
transactions,
that
in
and
of
itself
does
not
exclude
the
evidence
in
the
federal
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
the
only
basis
of
dealing
with
this
question
or
the
problem
--
the
only
problem
is
whether
in
fact
the
official
--
the
evidence
was
secured
by
the
federal
officials
in
circumstances,
which
if
there
had
be
no
intervention
of
state
authorities,
they
would
be
held
responsible
for
it
under
mcnabb.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
in
the
interest
of
that
was
--
you
see
mr.
heffron,
i
had
my
recollection
verified.
michigan
is
the
sole
state
in
union
which
in
1960
adopted
the
mallory
rules,
for
your
information.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
why
i'm
telling
it
to
you.
