mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
to
review
its
judgment
in
the
civil
action
brought
by
the
united
states
to
recover
statutory
damages
for
the
fraudulent
purchases
of
government
property.
respondent
hougham
is
a
used
car
dealer,
the
other
three
respondents
are
veterans,
who
had
been
found
fraudulently
obtained
veteran's
priorities
certificates
and
used
them
to
purchase
for
hougham
some
$79,500
worth
of
surplus
trucks
and
trailers.
the
fraud
consisted
of
misrepresentations
and
their
applications
for
these
certificates
that
the
property
was
to
be
used
by
them
in
their
own
businesses
whereas
in
fact
they
had
no
businesses
in
purchasing
the
property
for
hougham.
those
findings
were
affirmed
on
appeal
and
they
are
not
an
issue
here.
the
only
question
here
is
the
measure
of
recovery
to
which
the
united
states
is
entitled.
the
statute,
section
26
(b)
of
the
surplus
properly
act
of
1944,
which
is
set
forth
in
our
main
brief
at
pages
2
and
3,
provides
three
alternative
measures
of
recovery.
the
defrauder
is
required
to
pay
either
$2,000
for
each
fraudulent
act
plus
double
damages
or
if
the
united
states
shall
so
elect,
a
sum
equal
to
twice
the
consideration
agreed
to
be
given
to
the
property.
or
again,
if
united
states
shall
so
elect
to
restore
the
property
itself
and
forfeit
you
on
this
page.
now,
neither
the
last
option
nor
actual
damages
under
the
first
option
are
involved
here.
and
the
choice
here
is
narrowed
to
recovery
of
either
$2,000
for
each
act
or
double
consideration
damages
under
the
second
option.
the
government's
claim
is
that
it
is
entitled
to
recover
under
the
second
option
26
(b)
(2)
that
is
twice
the
$79,500
paid
for
the
property
or
a
total
of
a
$159,000.
the
district
court
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
we
were
entitled
to
recover
only
under
the
first
option
that
is
$2,000
for
each
act.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
court
held
that
the
--
the
only
accessible
acts
were
the
applications
for
the
priority
certificates.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
fraudulent
applications,
not
as
we
claimed
each
purchase.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
there
were
only
four
applications
producing
a
--
a
judgment.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
four
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
and
he
accessed
$2,000
for
each
of
those
four,
giving
us
a
judgment
of
$8,000.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
we
--
they
argued
it
that
each
purchase
was
an
accessible
act.
we
did
not
appeal
on
that
ground
and
do
not
raise
it
here.
our
only
argument
here
is
that
we're
entitled
to
recover
under
the
second
option
rather
than
the
first
that
is
double
consideration
damages
instead
of
$2,000
assessments.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
--
the
purchases
were
for
$79
--
$79,500.
it's
about
150
trucks
and
trailers.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
trucks
and
trailers,
i
think
mostly
trucks,
a
total
of
150
items.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
that
was
the
purchase
price,
price
of
which
facility.
we
don't
know
what
the
value
it
was.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
now,
in
its
original
complaint,
the
government
asked
for
$2,000
assessments
under
the
first
option
on
the
basis
of
the
150
items
purchased
as
we
asked
it
initially
for
$2,000
on
150
purchases.
however,
we
thereafter
file
the
motion
to
file
a
second
amended
complaint
in
which
in
addition
to
making
various
corrections
in
factual
allegations,
we
change
the
prayer
for
relief
and
ask
instead
for
double
consideration
damages
that
is
twice
the
$79,000
or
$159,000.
respondents
opposed
the
amendment
and
in
the
conferences
with
the
judge-in-chambers,
the
trial
judge
indicated
that
he
thought
the
original
complaint
was
an
irrevocable
election
and
we
couldn't
change
the
prayer
for
relief
to
ask
a
double
consideration
damages.
government
counsel
thereupon
withdrew
that
motion
to
file
the
first
amended
complaint
and
with
this
court
did
file
a
second
amended
complaint
making
only
the
changes
to
the
factual
allegations
and
keeping
the
original
prayer
for
relief.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
and
we
had
withdrawn
the
first
amended
complaint
and
we
do
not
rely
on
it.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
we
say
we
went
to
trial
on
the
pretrial
order.
i
haven't
come
to
that.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
what
then
happened
was
after
further
pretrial
proceedings,
the
district
court
entered
a
formal
pretrial
order
under
rule
16
of
the
federal
rules.
the
crucial
paragraph
of
that
order
appears
at
page
101
of
the
record,
that's
paragraph
(b)
there.
that
recites
the
trial
court's
previously
indicated
view
that
the
original
complaint
was
an
irrevocable
election
and
that
we
couldn't
change
it.
it
states
the
government's
contention
that
the
original
complaint
was
not
irrevocable
and
the
government's
election
if
not
barred
by
the
original
complaint
of
double
consideration
damages
under
the
second
option.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
first
amended
complaint,
we
never
got
to
a
formal
ruling.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
we
filed
it
and
it's
been
an
informal
conferences.
the
judge
indicated
that
he
would
not
allow
it
but
there's
no
ruling
on
the
record.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes
but
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
was
withdrawn
by
the
government,
without
being
--
any
--
any
ruling
being
in
and
on
record.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
was
withdrawn
and
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
we
did
not.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
we
did
not
do
that,
and
we
do
not
--
we
do
not
here
rely
on
this.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
we
withdrew
the
motion
and
so
the
motion
to
file
was
never
acted
on
--
of
record.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
we've
got
the
motion
to
life.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
precisely
right
mr.
justice.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
we
did
not
stand
on
that
and
we
do
not
stand
on
it
here.
we
stand
it
here
on
the
pretrial
order
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
which
does
expressly
state
our
election
and
in
itself
states
as
the
federal
rules
provide
that
it
governs
the
issues
to
be
litigated
in
the
course
of
the
trial.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
the
reason
that
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
have
spelled
out
the
--
these
procedures
not
because
we
think
they're
important
but
because
respondents
do
make
the
argument
that
we
weigh
our
claim
to
double
consideration
damages.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
we
have
a
ruling
by
the
district
court
that
we
are
bound
by
the
first
election.
we
have
a
ruling
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
disagrees
with
the
district
court
on
that
ground,
but
affirms
the
decision
on
the
ground
that
the
district
court
is
not
bound
by
our
election
but
that
the
district
court
itself
has
discretion
to
choose
among
the
several
remedies.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
in
this
case.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
not
sure
i
--
i
understand.
as
i
understand
it,
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
rule.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
ruled
that
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
our
election,
even
though
properly
made
wasn't
buying
it.
it's
that
i
understand
it
to
be
your
question.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
that's
what
the
court
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
--
that
is
what
i
understand
to
be
the
court
of
appeals
holding,
though,
i
must
say,
it
is
not
entirely
clear
what
the
court
of
appeals
is
saying.
now,
i
understand
that
to
be
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
now,
i
may
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
the
reason
i've
gone
into
this
is
the
respondents
assert
various
other
ground
in
support
of
their
judgment
which
they're
entitled
to
do
and
i'm
attempting
to
answer
all
of
those,
as
well
as
the
court
of
appeal's
ground.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
rely
upon
these
procedural
myths.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
it
does
decide
that
the
district
court
is
not
bound
by
the
government's
election.
now,
precisely
the
grounds
for
that
on
how
the
district
court
is
supposed
to
make
the
choice
is
not
clear
from
its
opinion,
but
i
think
it
is
clear
if
that
is
what
he
is
holding.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
now
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes
and
that's
the
arguments
respondents
to
make
that
i
--
i'm
trying
to
anticipate
and
ask,
that
we
made
our
election
in
pretrial
order
and
the
court
--
the
district
court
did
expressly
rule
upon
it
in
the
final
conclusions
of
law
on
the
ground
that
the
original
complaint
was
in
irrevocable
election
and
we
cannot
there
have
to
change
it.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
i
wasn't
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
wasn't
in
fact
planning
so
much
time
on
that
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
--
i
--
the
original
judgment
entered
by
the
district
court
for
$8000
was
not
stated
into
an
appeal.
we
accordingly
filed
judgment
liens
against
respondent's
property.
the
respondents
came
around
and
wanted
their
property
release
from
the
liens
and
offered
to
pay
$8000
which
we
accepted
and
released
the
liens,
and
they
now
contended
that
made
the
case
moot.
i
can
only
say
that
they
have
not
cited
the
single
case
in
support
of
that
proposition
and
we
do
not
know
if
they
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no
papers
other
than
acknowledgement
of
the
payment
and
we
see
the
way
he
meant.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
do
not
believe
it
was.
i
think
--
i
think
the
reason
it
wasn't,
though
i
don't
think
it
would
make
a
difference
whether
we
got
some
inclination
that
the
respondents
were
going
to
claim
that
it
was
moot
and
at
that
point,
we
decided
not
to
discharge
the
judgment
just
for
that
reason.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
they
were
making
the
argument
and
there's
no
point
in
giving
them
more
ammunition
to
make
it
with,
but
we
--
no,
no
authority,
the
payment
of
a
smaller
judgment
in
any
way
acceptance,
in
any
way
wage
or
claim
to
a
larger
amount
or
an
appeal
on
the
ground.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
would
think
not
your
honor.
the
judgment
if
not
stated
is
a
judgment
outstanding
requiring
him
to
pay
$8000
and
he
pays
it.
i
think
it
is
by
force
of
law
at
this
charge.
now,
if
that
judgment
is
--
is
reversed
on
appeal
and
it
is
still
a,
i
think,
appealable
order
even
though
he
satisfied
it.
the
parties
--
if
he
has
succeeded
the
parties,
you
turn
to
the
original
positions.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
not
--
not
entered.
he
paid
the
$8000,
if
we
acknowledge
receipt
up.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
i'm
not
sure
how
--
how
i
can
answer
that.
we
did
not
enter
a
--
a
stipulation
to
discharge
the
judgment.
certainly,
we
cannot
collect
anything
more,
that
were
the
only
judgment
ultimately
to
be
affirmed.
we
have
a
number
of
citations
in
our
opening
brief
on
the
question
and
respondent.
as
i
say,
it
has
no
authority
to
support
that
position.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
right.
i
was
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
was
on
the
--
it
was
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
as
i
remember
it.
at
that
time,
the
notes
were
given
and
final
payments
on
the
notes
actually
were
not
until
after
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
but
i
don't
think
that
makes
any
difference.
on
--
getting
to
the
grounds
for
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
which
as
we
understand
it
is
--
it's
just
that
the
district
court
is
not
bound
by
our
election.
i
would
like
to
say,
first
and
which
i
think
is
a
complete
answer
is
that
the
district
court
never
made
the
finding
for
the
court
of
appeals'
reports
to
affirm.
the
district
court's
conclusions
of
law
explicitly
and
exclusively
are
based
upon
the
ground
that
the
original
election
was
irrevocable
as
a
matter
of
law,
not
an
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
district
court
to
choose
for
itself
among
the
remedies.
it
just
held
that
we
were
bound
by
our
first
election.
but
passing
--
passing
that
difficulty,
we
think
it's
equally
clear
that
the
district
court
does
not
have
the
discretion
to
choose
among
the
remedies.
the
statute
on
that
question
is
as
ex
--
as
explicit
as
it
is
possible
seems
to
us
first
statute
to
be.
it
says
that
the
defaulter
shall
pay
$2,000
or,
if
the
united
states
shall
so
elect,
shall
pay
twice
the
consideration
agree
could
be
given.
or,
if
the
united
states
shall
so
elect,
return
the
property
and
forfeit
the
amount
of
pay.
now,
if
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
that
the
reason
for
the
words
at
the
election
of
the
government
was
to
make
it
clear
that
the
remedies
were
not
accumulated,
but
not
--
we
think
obviously
is
not
an
explanation
because
the
disjunctive
or
by
itself
makes
them
alternative
instead
of
cumulative.
and
the
only
possible
function
for
the
words,
if
united
states
shall
so
elect,
is
to
make
clear
who
it
is
and
how
the
choice
is
to
be
made,
namely
is
to
be
made
by
the
government.
now,
since
the
statutory
expressly
gives
united
states
the
right
to
recover
whichever
of
the
three
alternatives
it
elects.
we
think
it's
clear
that
upon
a
timely
and
proper
election,
there's
no
function
that
the
district
court
other
than
the
traditional
one
of
determining
whether
the
government
has
proved
its
case
and
established
the
amount
to
which
it
is
entitled
under
the
election.
now
in
particular,
i
would
like
to
say
that
respondent's
suggestion
that
--
and
this
maybe
behind
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
that
the
government's
election
should
be
disallowed
unless
the
government
affirmatively
proves
actual
damages
proportionate
to
the
recovery,
which
simply
defeat
the
purpose
statute
which
as
this
court
acknowledge
in
the
rex
trailer
case
and
through
50
u.s.
was
to
provide
a
--
a
liquidated
measure
of
recovery
for
damages
which
are
in
their
very
nature
difficult
or
even
impossible
to
prove.
now,
i
don't
want
to
be
understood
of
saying
that
there
are
no
judicially
and
forcible
limits
on
what
the
government
elects.
we
can
acknowledge
this
--
the
possibility
at
least
of
the
case
arising
in
which
a
literal
application
of
one
of
the
remedies
would
produce
a
--
a
--
recovery
so
grossly
disproportionate
to
any
possible
remedial
purpose
that
it
might
by
the
constitutional
limitations
or
possibly
limitations
implicit
in
the
statute.
but,
all
that
mean
is
that
when
that
happens
in
any
given
case,
the
court
properly
can
and
should
disallow
the
recovery.
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
court
has
general
discretion
in
all
cases
to
choose
among
the
three
alternatives,
so
long
as
the
government's
choice
does
not
produce
an
unconstitutionally
excessive
result
or
otherwise
illegal
result
if
we
submit
must
be
given
effect.
i
would
like
also
to
answer
the
other
arguments
on
which
the
respondent
seeks
to
sustain
the
judgment,
which
were
not
adapted
by
the
court
of
appeals.
i've
dealt
already
with
the
argument
that
we
didn't
raise
the
issue
in
the
trial
court.
we
did
make
our
election
in
pretrial
order
and
that
was
the
controlling
order
under
a
new
case
and
the
court
ruled
them.
he
makes
also
another
argument
which
depends
upon
that
one.
he
argues
that
the
election
should
not
be
allowed
because
the
change
of
election
should
not
be
allowed,
because
of
the
prejudicial.
the
prejudice
that
he
claims
is
that
the
case
was
tried
on
the
--
under
the
first
option
of
the
$2,000
pack
assessment
theory
and
he
says
that
he
would
therefore
be
prejudiced
if
he
now
apply
a
different
measure.
but
the
fact
is
that
he
made
the
election
before
the
trial
and
not
after
the
trial.
he
made
it
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
believe
our
original
complaint
has
a
general
prayer
for
double
damage.
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
certain
to
that
plus
the
two
thousand
plus
double
damages.
our
second
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
our
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
--
it
didn't.
our
second
amended
complaint
doesn't
even
ask
for
double
damages.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
do
not
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
that
is
right.
that
is
right.
and
--
and
we've
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
that
the
--
the
additional
recovery
of
double
damages,
it
does.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
do
not
believe
we
did
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i,
i
--
i'm
not
sure
we
would
have
to
plead
it.
but
in
the
event,
we
dropped
any
claim
for
double
damages
in
the
second
amended
complaint
and
in
the
pretrial
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
is
concerned
with
the
relationship
of
the
recovery
to
the
damage
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
as
i've
suggested,
but
we
contend
that
as
rex
trailer
made
clear.
we
can't
be
required
actually
to
prove
damages
to
support
just
our
liquidated
recoveries.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
there
was
a
constitutional
issue
involved
in
rex
trailer.
and
the
kind
of
situation
i
have
in
mind
will
be
more
likely
to
arise
into
the
first
option,
the
$2,000
assessments.
say
for
a
hundred
desk
papers,
if
we
try
to
assess
$2,000
for
each
desk
paper
regarding
a
recovery
of
$200,000,
i
think
that
might
be
this
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes
--
well
--
i,
i
don't
--
i
don't
want
to
resolve
what
the
constitutional
limits
might
be.
i'm
only
--
i
only
wish
to
acknowledge
that
there
might
be
some.
the
--
the
other
argument
which
respondents
make
here
in
defense
of
their
judgment
again
not
relied
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
that,
26
(b)
(2)
the
double
consideration
measure
is
inapplicable
to
the
transactions
involved
here
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
has
two
aspects.
well,
the
first
of
which
is
suggested
by
the
court
of
appeals,
so
i
don't
think
that
is
it's
holding.
the
court
of
appeals
suggests
that
it
may
not
be
applicable
at
all
to
executed
transactions
only
to
a
transaction
where
there
has
been
an
agreement
to
purchase
which
has
never
been
executed.
now,
there's
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
section
to
suggest
that
distinction
and
we
do
not
understand
why
it
would
ever
be
more
posit
in
one
case
that
the
other.
if
anything,
it's
a
less
burdensome
recovery
in
an
executed
transaction
than
in
an
unexecuted
one.
in
the
executed
transaction,
the
defaulter
does
end
up
paying
three
times
instead
of
twice
the
price
for
the
goods.
but,
for
the
third
payment,
he
got
the
goods
and
he's
entitled
to
keep
them.
and
therefore,
he
got
the
benefit
of
his
bargain
and
pays
his
damages
only
the
same
amount
that
the
--
that
he
would
in
an
unexecuted
transaction.
and
certainly,
there's
no
reason
to
prefer
the
one
who
gets
the
fruit
to
this
bargain
over
the
one
who
discovered
before
he's
able
to
do
so.
the
respondent's
argument
here
is
slightly
different.
he
agrees
that
it
applies
generally
to
execute
transactions,
but
contends
that
the
transaction
must,
at
one
point,
or
a
(inaudible)
in
time
have
been
executory.
he
distinguishes
between
a
bid
and
award
with
a
high
max
before
payment
and
an
over-the-counter
sale
with
simultaneous
payment.
presumably
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
refers
to
consideration
agreed
to
be
given
and
an
over-counter
--
over-the-counter
sale,
there's
consideration
given
but
none
agreed
to
be
given.
well,
first
the
record
does
not
support
his
characterization
of
these
transactions,
but
more
than
that
the
--
the
distinction
we
think
is
of
no
substance
in
over-the-counters
--
even
in
over
--
over-the-counter
sale,
the
parties
necessarily
agreed
on
the
price
to
be
paid.
and
there
is
an
agreement
which
would
in
fact
support
a
maximum
contract
if
by
miscounting
the
change
or
otherwise,
it
turned
out
to
be
not
paid
to
full
price.
and
finally,
we
think,
there
is
no
possible
reason
to
distinguish
the
measure
of
recovery
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
measurable
(inaudible)
or
time
between
the
agreement
and
the
payment.
i
would
like
if
i
may
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
my
first
care
of
the
number
of
trucks
involved
a
quick
count,
comes
to
46
trucks
out
of
149
items.
the
others
were
all
trailers.
there
were
not
tires
or
inner
tubes
in
the
second
amended
complaint.
something
--
there
were
(inaudible)
first
complaint
but
they
were
going
down.
as
to
the
pretrial
order
who
wrote
the
order,
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
government
counsel
did
prepare
the
order.
since
writing
the
--
filing
our
brief,
i've
checked
the
rules
of
the
court
in
--
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
which
restitute
an
earlier,
and
it
may
cleared
up
to
say
that
those
rules
provide
that
the
plaintiff,
whatever
happens
to
the
plaintiff,
shall
submit
the
order
and
it
shall
be
approved
as
to
form
and
substance
by
both
parties.
i
hear
it
literally
says
form
and
context,
trying
to
suggest
from
this
print
of
content
though
we
don't
think
it
may
make
something
difference.
now,
as
to
the
rule
of
the
court,
this
--
just
that
we're
depriving
the
court
of
any
rule
seems
to
us
the
court
has
precisely
the
same
rule
in
this
case
that
has
any
other
to
determine
whether
the
party
claiming
the
right
has
that
right.
and
the
statute
gives
us
three
rights
among
which
we
make
elect
and
we
elect
then
we
are
claiming
that
right
and
the
court
can
determine
whether
we
have
approved
our
case,
whether
it
established
fraud
and
in
this
case,
whether
we
have
established
the
consideration
agreed
to
be
paid.
nothing
more
remains
to
be
found
and
that
we
submit
is
in
the
end
of
the
case.
thank
you
very
much.
