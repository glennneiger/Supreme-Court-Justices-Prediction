then,
as
i
understand
it
mr.
barnett,
the
second

did
pray
for
the
$
2,000
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
per
debt
--
for
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
the
transaction.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
the
one
you
want
to
trial
on
now?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
actually,
it
was
never
filed.
if
you
filed
a
motion
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
for
leave
to
file
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
then
before
action,
you
withdrew
the
motion
for
leave.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
even
if
the
--
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
about
that,
you
still
have
to
show
that
the
question
was
lie
there,
don't
you
and
that
you
haven't
waived
it
in
the
district
court?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
was
that
satisfaction
of
the
judgment
mr.
barnett?
where
--
has
there
been
a
satisfaction
of
the
judgment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
what
the
judgment
before,
$8000.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
took
$8000.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
was
that
a
satisfaction
of
the
judgment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
but
isn't
it
true
that
this
is
the
language
of
subdivision
1
of
section
26
and
it
is
not
in
the
disjunctive,
it's
$2,000
and
damages.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
he
asked
(inaudible)
to
a
--
a
pretrial
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you're
also
going
to
argue
the
satisfaction
going?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
you
relied
on
that,
anything
else
abusive,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
are
we
talking
--
if
i
may
suggest,
are
we
talking
about
compromise,
settlement
or
are
we
talking
about
satisfaction
in
the
judgment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
when
--
when
one
has
a
judgment
for
y
dollars
and
he
receives
y
dollars,
are
there
any
legal
implications
as
to
intentions
to
satisfy?
have
you
any
views
on
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
many
satisfactions
can't
there
be?
