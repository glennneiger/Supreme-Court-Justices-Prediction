well,
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
he
was
not
given
any
chance
to
go
over
and
makes
suggestions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
object
to
that?
did
you
ask
for
the
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
object
--
did
you
object
to
not
being
allowed
to
participate
in
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
sign
it
yourself?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
accepted
the
payment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say
that
accepted
the
remedy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
did
asked
for
judgment,
the
great
deal
was
be
more
than
that
and
not
deceive
this,
and
the
cases
and
--
as
a
read
them
is
fully
upheld
that
that
was
--
you
can't
say
that
will
stop
the
man
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
claiming
the
reversal
of
the
judgment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
government
does
challenge
one
of
the
judgments
on
the
ground
that
entitled
about
a
100
and
how
much
more?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
took
the
case
up
on
the
ground
that
has
not
enough
and
while
there
in
ordinary
cases,
this
maybe
an
exception
in
ordinary
cases.
the
mere
acceptance
of
a
judgment
which
is
less
hard
explained
is
not
ground
to
say
that
he
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
appeal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if
you
can
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
can
show
that
they
said
we're
going
to
accept
this
payment
of
all
and
we're
going
to
stand
in
our
appeal.
that's
another
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
said
it
will
imply
if
they
were.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
you
paid.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
when
you
paid
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
have
accepted.
if
you
intended
it
on
condition,
they
accepted
as
they
were
in
fraud
and
not
to
claim
more,
that
would
have
been
monetary.
can
find
you
find
--
can
you
find
in
of
such
agreement
or
the
expressed
are
implied
from
this
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
a
--
that
maybe
that
the
court
will
hold
that
but
do
you
have
any
cases
that
upheld,
that
are
indicated,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
you
do
you
do
with
cases
like
erwin
against
lowry
which
is
you
said,
it's
precisely
a
different
rule,
that
the
payment
of
the
judgment
when
it's
less
to
the
man's
claim
and
in
then
appeal
not
to
be
taken
as
abandoned
by
him
or
his
rights
and
you
get
a
reversal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
you
wouldn't
pay
it
if
you
didn't
admit
owing
as
i
suggest
that's
right.
