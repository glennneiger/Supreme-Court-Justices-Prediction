mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court,
counsel
for
the
government.
first,
in
answer
to
justice
frankfurter's
inquiry
with
respect
to
the
record
as
to
the
contents
of
the
prayer
in
the
first
complaint,
the
prayer
asked
for
a
monetary
amount
in
damage
of
each
defendant
and
i'll
name
only
one.
they
are
all
typical.
against
the
defendant,
owen
dailey
had
asked
for
$138,000.
that
figure
is
right
there
on
the
basis
of
$2,000,
a
purchase
as
alleged
in
the
complaint.
in
other
words,
$2,000
an
act
and
the
material
part
of
what
you
inquired
about
says
this,
"plus
double
the
amount
of
damages
which
this
court
may
deem
together
with
cost
and
interest
in
cost
of
this
suit".
the
complaint
in
no
respect,
in
any
place
alleges
that
the
government
suffered
any
monetary
damage
of
any
kind
or
damage
of
any
character
except
a
so-called
benefit
that
it
might
have
been
deprived
of
by
having
one
otherwise
not
entitled
to
purchase
of
product
at
a
fair
price,
in
other
words,
the
selection
of
the
customer.
it
is
our
position,
if
the
court
please,
that
this
problem
that
the
government
poses
has
never
been
properly
presented
to
this
court
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
or
to
the
federal
district
court.
as
counsel
says,
"it
came
into
the
case
at
a
time
not
when
the
government
had
indicated
that
--
the
court
had
indicated
possibly
that
$2,000
per
act
was
--
was
improper
because
an
election
is
made.
it
came
before
the
court
at
a
time
when
the
government
was
arguing
$2,000
an
act
in
response
to
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
the
point
was
made
that
the
allegation
--
did
--
the
complaint
would
not
support
a
prayer
for
damages
for
double
consideration.
now,
that
is
the
status
of
the
case
and
in
the
heat
of
that
argument,
the
government
voluntarily
withdrew
its
motion
to
file
this
first
amended
complaint
never
did
present
it
or
any
other
complaint
in
which
any
prayer
for
damages
other
than
$2,000
per
act
was
sought
for
by
the
government.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
i
don't
think
they
did,
your
honor.
and
my
reason
for
that
is
--
is
two-fold.
in
the
first
place,
the
pretrial
order
does
not
say
that
the
government
wanted
a
ruling
of
the
trial
court.
it
abstractly,
and
as
i
put
it
in
my
brief,
out
of
thin
air
brought
out
the
assertion
that
the
government
contends
that
it's
entitled
to
claim
$2,000
per
act
but
they
never
asked
the
district
court
for
a
ruling.
it
is
inserted
in
that
pretrial
order
out
of
thin
air.
it's
not
contained
in
any
of
the
proceedings
of
the
pretrial,
there
was
no
request
made.
the
purpose
of
pretrial
is
to
consider
the
advisability,
the
important
purpose.
a
pretrial
is
to
consider
the
advisability
of
amendment
to
the
pleadings,
had
the
government
chosen
at
that
time
to
make
the
contention,
rather
than
at
the
time
it
had
previously
withdrawn,
it
should
have
said,
"i
want
to
file
the
minute
it
complained
here."
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
no
request
was
ever
asked.
it
was
not
--
even
the
subject
was
not
brought
up
at
pretrial.
it
was
inserted
in
the
pretrial
order
prepared
by
the
government
after
the
pretrial
had
taken
place.
and
no
request
to
file
an
amendment
to
the
pleadings
was
ever
presented
to
or
ruled
upon
or
considered
at
the
pretrial.
that's
why
i
assert
that
there
never
was
the
question
properly
presented
in
the
district
court.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
it
certainly
is
your
honor,
but
it
was
inserted
there
not
as
a
result
of
whatever
was
taken
in
that
course
of
the
pretrial.
that's
the
government's
orders,
not
ours.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
it's
the
judge's
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
--
order.
i
have
to
admit
that.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
and
it's
asserted
in
there,
but
i
say
it's
asserted
improperly.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
well,
i
wasn't
aware
that
--
of
that
or
the
significance
at
the
time
i
did
it.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
that
certainly
is.
i
beg
no
contention
to
the
contour.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
well,
and
i'll
answer
that
the
--
that
i
have
no
particular
objection
to
the
context
of
the
order,
but
i
claim
it
does
not
raise
the
issue.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
yes,
it
does.
the
pretrial
says,
"we
have
previously
contended."
well,
they
have
not.
and
then
we
reasserted
here
to
preserve
it.
the
point
previously
made
for
purposes
of
appealing.
there'd
been
no
point
made.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
i'm
--
i'm
coming
to
that
and
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
alright,
alright.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
i
have
to
be
bound
by
that,
but
i
--
i
hadn't
finished
discussing
that
pretrial
order.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
the
pretrial
order
itself
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
that's
what
your
pretrial
ruling
required
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
alright,
then
let's
--
let
us
supplement
the
pleadings.
the
pretrial
order
still
says
that
the
government
is
contending
$2,000
per
act.
the
government
has
only
mentioned
part
of
its
pretrial
order
and
i
refer
you
to
page
94
of
the
pretrial
order
in
the
record.
so
what
do
we
have
here?
taking
it
in
the
position,
the
most
favorable
to
the
government.
the
government
is
asking
the
pretrial
court
to
make
a
selection
between
$2,000
per
act
and
doubled
consideration.
it's
leaving
it
still
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
court,
while
the
government's
voluntary
action
taken
at
the
pretrial
order.
now,
i
seek
further,
the
point
is
not
properly
before
this
court
because
why?
the
government
elected
to
go
trial,
on
the
second
demand
and
complaint,
well-knowing
that
it
sought
$2,000
per
act.
and
incidentally,
i
forget
just
which
one
of
you
gentlemen
inquired
about
--
about
the
number
and
the
size
of
this
so-called
fraud
and
it's
--
it's
rather
important
here,
in
consideration
of
these
acts
and
so
forth
and
whether
double
consideration
would
be
appropriate.
as
the
trial
court
found,
there
were
only
four
activities
or
actions
taken
by
all
of
these
gentlemen
that
had
anything
questionable
about
it.
they
signed
this
application
for
the
right
to
later
purchase
if
they
wanted
to
surplus
property.
now,
the
question
was
asked
by
some
of
you
gentlemen,
how
many
items
were
involved
and
what
was
the
size
of
them?
and
counsel
replied
about
150
trucks.
actually,
the
record
i
--
no,
he
didn't
intentionally
misquote
it.
but
actually,
the
record
will
show
that
only
about
11
sizeable
articles
in
value
of
over
$2,000
were
involved
and
a
150
or
60
or
70
may
be
even
more
that
he
mentioned
than
that
were
articles
of
--
of
insignificant
value
or
small
monetary
value.
i
have
in
mind
an
order
of
60
or
70
trailers,
mount
trailers.
i
have
in
mind
an
order
of
tires,
many
items
of
tires.
let's
say
worth,
$7
and
$14
and
they
started
out
asking
for
$2,000
tires.
$2,000
for
$27
bomb
shelters
and
they
had
only
about
a
dozen,
and
i'm
speaking
at
round
figures,
articles
of
substantial
value
that
embraced
the
total
of
$2,000
per
act
figure.
i
brought
up
this
rather
stupendous
amount
in
the
prayer
because
of
the
--
of
the
numerical
largeness
of
the
number
of
a
great
many
articles
of
insignificant
value,
rather
than
--
than
a
terrific
amount
of
--
of
big
articles.
now,
that
has
a
bearing
on
--
on
whether
or
not
when
you
have
your
--
your
remedy
whether
it's
going
to
be
as
was
suggested
by
justice
frankfurter
to
be
a
deprivation
of
property
without
due
process
or
severe
--
so
severe
as
to
be
penal.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
yes.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
yes.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
yes,
the
case
was
argued
on
based
on
$2,000
per
act.
in
my
argument,
that
the
only
acts
that
was
--
were
tricks
or
devices
which
is
the
penalty
that
act
specify.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
well,
we
contended
all
the
way
down
the
line
and
the
trial
court
at
the
end
and
i
quote
that
in
my
brief.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
the
end
of
the
trial
after
all
the
evidence
was
in.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
now,
your
honor.
i
am
right
or
wrong
depending
upon
whether
the
pretrial
order
properly
presented
the
issue.
if
it
did,
i
would
concede
that
that
would
perhaps
be
a
proper
finding.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
but
i
contend
that
there
never
was
a
proper
pretrial
order.
it
never
was
before
the
court
or
raised
it
all
of
the
trial.
we
went
to
trial
on
the
second
amended
complaint,
asking
for
$2,000
per
act.
and
therefore,
the
finding
that
you
quote,
"i
contend
to
be
surplus,
each
being
outside
of
the
issues
presented
to
the
court."
re-finding
of
the
court
is
on
findings
3,
9,
and
11,
which
appear
in
transcripts
at
page
107
through
113.
anyone
of
them
are
significant
thereof,
and
take
finding
3
which
is
in
reference
to
the
first
count.
and
that
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
no,
i
don'
think
so
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
--
your
honor.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
now,
i
have
in
mind
page
107
of
the
transcript.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
and
there,
the
court
finds
that
the
sum
of
$2,000
per
act
is
not
appropriate
not
because
the
government
had
made
an
election
but
because
the
evidence
wouldn't
support
that
there
have
ever
been
any
money
as
agreed
to
be
paid.
that
is
the
basis
of
the
trial
court's
judgment
and
it
sound
--
it's
the
trial
court's
--
it
was
determination
that
section
26
(b)
(2)
in
the
surplus
act
was
improper
to
the
facts
and
appropriate
to
the
facts
in
this
case
because
the
trick
did
not
involve
a
monetary
scheme.
this
trick
was
a
representation
as
to
quality
or
--
or
to
timeliness
only.
the
dollar
part
of
the
transaction
was
fair
and
honest
to
everybody.
there
was
no
deception
or
advantage
gain
or
loss
by
the
government
monetary
wise
and
that
was
a
consideration
that
the
court
found
to
support
the
judgment
and
necessarily
the
conclusion
that
was
inserted
in
the
findings
out
of
thin
air
which
was
never
before
the
court
had
initiated
that
they
have
made
an
election.
however
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
yes,
i'm
trying.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
mr.
lavigne
of
the
united
states
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
--
attorney's
office.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
yes.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
that's
right.
now,
what
actually
is
what
the
government
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
judge
gilbert
jertberg,
yes
in
the
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
he
ordered
this
--
this
one
to
be
grant
by
counsel.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
by
the
government
counsel.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
it's
unusual.
now
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
no,
i
was
not
your
honor.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
frankly,
i
did
not
raise
a
timely
objection
to
the
form
of
the
findings.
i
have
to
accept
them
and
need
them
if
the
heard
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
well,
i
was
allowed
to
participate
to
--
in
this
--
to
this
extent
that
--
and
i
cited
it
in
my
brief.
i
have
--
i
have
--
won't
go
back
to
the
record
right
now.
it's
in
the
--
the
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
that's
right.
the
memorandum
on
--
on
the
transcripts
to
the
court's
opinion
and
the
findings
of
the
close
case
which
appeared
i
think
at
court
37
following
where
the
court
gave
an
oral
summary
and
i
quote
a
part
of
it
in
a
--
in
a
footnote
in
my
--
in
my
brief.
he
gave
an
oral
summary
of
what
he
thought
and
how
he
thought
the
case
should
be
decided
in
which
he
said
as
he
was
con
--
he
was
impressed
with
the
$2,000
per
act
on
the
four
applications
only.
and
then
he
direct
that
he
says,
"the
government
will
prepare
findings
in
accordance
with
my
views
expressed
here."
so
to
that
extent,
to
answer
your
questions
sir,
i
did
participate
and
i
had
assumed
and
perhaps
maybe
not
carefully
enough
that
the
government
would
confine
its
order
and
findings
to
the
remarks
directed
by
the
trial
judge.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
that's
the
provision
in
section
16
of
the
rules
as
well
as
the
--
the
part
of
the
actual
order.
and
if
it
just
says
supplement,
we
have
the
second
amended
complaint
where
you
have
a
government
praying
for
$2,000
an
act.
we
have
--
we
have
the
government
in
the
pretrial
order
containing
$2,000
an
act
and
double
consideration.
in
other
words,
we
have
the
government
blowing
wind
at
both
ends.
it
says
that
once
a
privilege
of
shooting
three
rabbits
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
hiding
the
two
skinny
winds
and
from
the
game
ordain
and
taking
the
fat
one
home.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
by
six
months.
it
came
out
in
january
and
the
pretrial
was
in
september
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
yes,
i'll
have
to
take
--
yes,
that's
--
that's
there
it
is
but
i
--
i
argue
for
what
it's
worth
at
the
pretrial
order
and
the
--
incidentally,
there
are
--
there
are
two
cases
are
in
that
point
that
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
if
i
can
find
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
that's
right.
i
can
find
a
balance
of
my
time
to
--
to
the
real
substantive
point
that
i
don't
admit
before
the
court.
anyway
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
i
think
i
haven't
rather
fully
covered
in
my
brief
your
honor
and
i
agree
with
all
of
you
have
expressed
here
i
think
the
government
conclusively
has
accepted
the
form
of
release
specified
by
the
act
which
says
it
has
to
elect
warrant.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
that's
right.
that's
right
whether
if
--
if
i'm
right
on
any
one
of
these
points
while
your
problem
is
simple.
but
i
would
like
to
make
a
few
remarks
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
i
have
no
doubt
on
what
that
should
be
in
proper
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
it
has
been
fulfilled.
it
says
that
they
have
the
option
of
finding
one
to
three.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
that's
right,
if
i'm
right.
there's
no
question
on
what
the
government
has
accepted
the
--
the
remedy
that
the
trial
court
told
them
they
were
entitled
to
but
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
because
the
remedy
have
the
trial
court
was,
that
there
were
four
acts
and
the
law
says
$2,000
per
act
and
they
have
accepted
the
money.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
oh,
i
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
i
quite
agree
with
you
justice
black
up
to
this
point.
we
have
the
surplus
act
which
says
they're
entitled
to
one
form
of
relief
only.
we
have
a
judgment
here
in
which
the
trial
court
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
were
--
but
four
acts.
that
point
has
not
been
challenged
on
appeal.
the
government
does
not
contend
that
the
finding
is
clear
erroneous.
in
other
words,
if
--
if
they
should
have
$2,000
for
every
$14
tire.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
well,
the
government
asked
for
two
--
for
doubly
consideration
agreed
to
be
paid.
and
that
is
substantially
more
than
four
acts.
that's
correct.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
well,
they
accepted
that
under
circumstances
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
they
accepted
that
the
--
your
statement
is
correct
as
a
matter
of
law.
it's
not
quite
factually
the
situation
here.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
the
government
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
no,
they
never
said
that
but
they
took
the
notes
and
they
took
the
money
and
i
can't
say
that
they
said
that
they
would
abandon
their
appeal.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
well,
i
say
as
matter
of
law
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
after
they
take
the
$8000
at
a
time
when
the
judgment
itself
was
not
final
and
being
appealed
by
both
lawyers.
we
didn't
admit
until
--
we
didn't
admit
at
the
time
this
was
made.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
then
we
owe
the
8000
when
they
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
well,
we
tendered
it
and
they
took
and
the
rule
as
i
understand
is
if
you
accept
the
benefits
of
a
judgment,
you
waive
your
right
to
challenge
it.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
there
the
agreement,
no.
the
record
did
not
go
that
far.
we
tendered
$8000
and
they
took
it.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
no.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
it
represented
a
full
satisfaction
of
one
theory
of
recovery
and
now
the
--
the
government
can't
accept
the
benefit
if
one
theory
of
recovery
and
challenge
it.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
well
all
--
all
of
the
cases
that
the
government
collected
in
its
brief
i
think
recognized
that
statute
to
the
general
rule
of
guess.
they
claim
that
there
--
they
claim
that
there
without
that
exception
because
they
claim
that
they
--
they
didn't
accept
it
in
full
but
when
--
when
your
matters
in
controversy
and
--
and
there
you
tendered
some
up
a
certain
price
and
take
it,
they're
precluded
thereafter
and
says
the
doctrine
a
waiver
or
election
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
i'm
talking
about
satisfaction
i
think.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
well
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
well
i
think
--
i
think
the
government
by
taking
the
money
is
--
is
obligated
as
a
matter
of
law
to
satisfy
the
judgment
that's
--
that's
the
import
of
the
judgment.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
i
say
only
one.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
as
i
understand
that
case
--
as
i
understand
that
case
in
the
other
cases
in
the
group
and
the
payment
of
an
amount
admittedly
owing
can
we
at
--
at
that
time
in
this
payment
admitted
only
nothing.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
well,
we
were
still
appealing
and
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
yes.
yes,
your
honor
and
this
payment
had
all
has
took
place
during
dependancy
of
the
cross
appeal.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
i
see
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
everybody
was.
that's
right.
now
--
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
my
--
[laughter]
my
final
point
i
see
the
white
light
is
on
me
and
i'll
have
to
be
rather
rapid,
is
that
i
don't
agree
with
the
government's
contention
as
to
the
proper
and
meaning
of
the
surplus
act.
in
other
words,
as
i
read
the
act,
if
this
word
alternative
that
the
government
uses
time
and
time
again,
you
won't
find
it
in
the
act.
the
government
says,
"we
are
entitled
after
proving
fraud
of
any
kind
to
fit
a
thin
air
anyone
with
three
remedy."
i
contend
that
is
not
a
proper
construction
of
the
act,
that
a
proper
construction
of
the
act
shows
that
it
was
made
purposely
broad
to
fit
very
factual
situations.
in
other
words,
a
$2000
an
act
could
be
appropriate
remedy
for
some
situation,
double
consideration
might
considerably
be
appropriate
to
some
situations
such
as
excecutory
contracts.
the
policy
of
the
war
surplus
act
was
to
get
rid
of
surplus
property.
it
contemplated
the
--
the
channeling
of
large
volumes
of
property
not
only
by
slots
sale
but
by
contracts,
by
--
by
conditional
sales
contracts,
by
executory
contracts,
by
signed
payment
contracts.
and
as
i
read
the
act,
it
was
put
in
to
meet
that
sort
of
a
situation,
not
a
situation
where
there's
no
monetary
fraud
involved.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
i
don't
exactly
go
that
far.
i
don't
think
i
have
to.
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
there
are
different
measures
of
damage
for
different
factual
situations.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
i
admit
that
the
government
has
a
right
in
the
first
instance
to
make
the
appropriate
selection.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
calvin
h.
conron,
jr.
that's
right.
they
have
the
right
in
the
first
instance
to
select
which
of
those
remedies
is
appropriate
according
to
their
opinion.
but
whether
the
--
whether
the
remedy
is
appropriate
to
the
occasion,
i
say
it's
within
the
power
of
the
court
in
the
last
analysis
to
determine.
i
say
that
in
the
other
construction
of
the
statute
would
--
would
lead
you
right
into
--
you
might
say
chaos.
it
would
strip
the
power
of
the
court
of
all
this
discretion.
it
would
make
the
trial
court
a
mere
chairman
of
a
--
of
a
proceeding
and
it
would
leave
the
judge
and
the
justice
of
the
justice
department
in
the
role
of
prosecutor
judge,
jury
and
executioner.
and
that
form
of
--
of
statutory
interpretation
has
not
been
are
off
for
many,
many
years.
we
got
away
from
that.
we
will
--
discarded
absolute
monarchy.
now,
one
final
word
in
--
in
reference
to
that
line,
it
has
always
been
a
practice
in
the
interpretation
of
the
so-called
penal
damage
statutes
and
i
say
that.
of
course,
when
the
court
is
considering
whether
the
statute
limitation
is
run
then
they
say
it's
compensatory.
but
when
--
but
now,
here
is
the
government
turning
right
around
and
asking
double
the
consideration
when
it's
already
been
fully
and
fairly
paid.
and
--
and
i
--
i
cite
your
honors'
attention
merely
to
this
--
to
the
--
to
the
false
claims
act,
the
copyright
laws
act,
the
patent
laws
act
as
waste
laws,
all
of
which
have
these
penal
provisions,
all
of
which
leaves
the
determination
of
reasonable
is
--
in
the
final
analysis
to
the
court.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you
for
your
attention.
