what
was
each
act
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
applications
were
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
four
documents
that
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
four
documents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
claim
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
--
did
i
hear
you
say
that
you
withdrew
the
amended
complaint
which
the
judge
disallowed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let
me
be
at
--
let
me
understand
it
very
explicitly.
in
the
sec
--
in
the
amend
--
in
the
first
amended
complaint,
you
asked
specifically
relief
and
that
you
regard
as
option
two
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
government's
elective.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
if
you
were
told
that
that
amended
would
be
disallowed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
what
state
very
accurately
had
you
do,
just
what
happened?
what
happened
to
that
amended
complaint?
was
it
dropped?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
was
withdrawn.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
didn't
stand
your
ground
and
say
you
are
entitled
to
file
it
and
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
entered
the
exception
on
the
adverse
ruling.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
asked
that
you
--
you
make
that
your
complaint.
the
court
indicated
it
wouldn't
grant
the
motion
and
you
withdrew
the
motion
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
make
that
the
basis
of
the
litigation,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
i
--
jumping
ahead
of
the
--
this
game
if
i
asked
or
that
when
this
gets
done
to
a
--
to
the
issue
of
procedure
or
pleading
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
rather
than
the
subsequent
matter
whether
if
by
initially
appropriate
make
explicit
complaint
in
allegation.
the
government
had
emission
as
whatever
choices,
thought
was
ultimately
to
this.
that
is
the
case
we
have
here,
is
it?
we
have
a
more
complicated
case
which
is
my
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
my
question
is
a
different
one.
is
there
a
ruling
or
have
you
before
it
a
ruling
which
says
the
government
may
not,
if
it
takes
appropriate
steps
seek
to
enforce
anyone
of
the
three
alternatives?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
in
this
case
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
in
general
proposition
that
if
the
government
initially,
i'd
like
you
to
answer
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
if
the
government
initially
had
said
in
appropriate
procedural
language
having
three
--
three
choices
for
reliefs,
we
choose
number
2.
are
we
to
rule
on
the
basis
of
this
record
that
the
government
couldn't
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
alright
if
it
ruled,
but
then
it
didn't
rule
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
didn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
important
to
me
what
is
says
there,
or
it's
all
tangled
up
with
the
kind
of
procedure
that
follower
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
here
before
you
started
out
with
the
choice
that
you
have,
would
reject
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
me,
there
were
great
deals
of
difference,
whether
we've
got
here
a
confuse
(inaudible)
court
of
appeals
would
taken,
which
probably
arrests
on
the
procedure
and
development
in
this
case,
all
under
the
issue
is
unclear
whether
it
doesn't
quite
when
you
put
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yet,
you
stated
isn't
clear
or
did
decide
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
during
your
complaint,
the
original
complaint
set
forth
the
ground
on
which
you
asked
double
--
what
kind
of
damages
did
you
ask
for?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
doubled
the
amount
of
any
damages?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
must
be
set
forth
from
specific
damage
of
the
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i'm
--
i'm
speaking
to
the
first.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
it
may
be
enough
what's
in
the
mind
of
that
fee.
what
was
in
his
mind
is
--
i
just
want
to
read
it
from
his
opinion.
he
was
thinking
about
this
business
of
damage
and
finds
some
indications
the
statute
is
concerned
with,
with
allegations
of
damage.
or,
if
damages
again
are
not
ascertainable
then
you
will
go
to
liquidate
the
damages.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
does
refer
to
damage?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
well,
if
double
damage
means
that
you
are
asserted
some
damage.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
you
must
have
been
in
particular.
you
must
be
particular
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
how
can
you
double
any
damage
unless
you
can
support
what
a
single
one
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
all
that.
what
i'm
trying
to
spell
it
out,
i
usually
like
to
find
out
why
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
if
i'm
to
find
it's
wrong.
that's
my
present
endeavor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
it's
mine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
i
was
led
to
this
inquiry
by
your
suggestion,
there
might
circumstances
whether
recovery
would
be
so
outrageous
to
even
invoke
the
constitution.
it
seems
to
be
impossible.
justice
felix
frankfurter
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
in
civil
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
a
little
troubled
by
what
you've
just
said
because
our
attention
was
called
to
page
101.
the
following
issues
of
law
and
no
others
remained
to
be
litigated
upon
the
trial
and
that
statement
of
the
issue
is
to
be
litigated
assigned
by
the
district
judge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
it's
the
judge's
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
said
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
what
context
is
a
context.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
satisfy
my
curiosity
by
telling
me
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
mr.
conron
who
addressed
at
the
pretrial
conference
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
the
counsel
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
counsel
address?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
whatever
it
may
be,
there's
certainly
of
a
flat
contradiction
between
orders
set
forth
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
page
94
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
action
flat
contradiction
as
they
did
to
(inaudible)
should
be
it
and
then
you
have
--
of
this
also.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
the
--
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
the
government's
second
complaint
which
the
court
indicated
it
was
the
--
no
government's
first
amended
complaint
which
the
court
indicated
it
would
not
grant.
that
--
that
offer
you
can
call
it
as
such,
any
of
that
transaction
preceded
this
pretrial
conference
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
that
answers
of
yours
goes
against
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
better
not
take
too
much
time
because
you
still
have
to
go
down
to
assuming
your
right
about
this,
you
still
have
to
meet
the
question
that
--
that
this
doesn't
bar
the
government
asking
if
the
matter
of
relief,
whatever
it
can
ask
some
of
the
statute
apart
from
the
pleading.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
true?
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
problem
is
if
--
if
--
if
you're
right
about
that
and
we
order
dismiss
this
case
is
in
improper
to
be
granted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there's
no
issue
on
--
on
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
rather
the
--
the
statute
have
been
fulfilled.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
said
if
you're
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
is
--
this
isn't
the
ordinary
case
of
a
man
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
owing
a
$100,000
and
it
takes
$8000
on
account
because
the
$8000
represented
one
theory
of
recovery.
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
everybody
was
dissatisfied
with
everything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
when
the
statute
pass
these
three
choices
shall
pay
or
shall
pay
the
government
elect
and
shall
pay
the
united
states
so
--
so
elect,
the
government
had
these
modes
of
seeking
relief
but
it's
still
left
for
the
court
to
decide
whether
they
elected
properly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
it's
not
for
the
government
to
choose
what
they
are
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
to
make
the
offer
of
this
is
our
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
important
to
say
what
the
case
is.
that's
your
point,
is
it?
