justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
withdrawn,
meaning
this
is
not
filed
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
not
in
effect
to
say
that
no
matter
what
the
government
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
desired
nor
how
it
may
have
evidence
its
choice
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
the
choice
was
not
to
be
made
by
the
government
but
by
the
trial
judges
as
a
matter
of
discretion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
issue
we
have,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
this
is
only
summary
mr.
barnett,
you
are
going
to
--
i
hope
give
a
few
minutes
to
reflect
that
the
government
took
the
$8,000
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
trying
to
get
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
wish
make
it
better.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
there
papers
passed
in
connection
with
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
the
record
--
was
that
the
judgment
discharged
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
will
identify,
make
some
difference
that
you
have
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
--
you
would
approve
it
yourself
mr.
conron,
as
to
form
and
context.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
105
and
is
that
your
signature?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
proved
that
the
form
and
context
can
certainly
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
says
context.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
addition
conron,
look
at
paragraph
9
at
page
104,
the
pretrial
order.
the
foregoing
admissions
having
been
made
by
the
parties
and
the
parties
have
specified
the
foregoing
issues
remaining
to
be
litigated.
this
order
shall
supplement
the
pleadings
and
govern
the
course
of
the
file
of
this
course
unless
modified
to
prevent
manifest
injustice,
page
104
of
the
record,
the
order
that
you
signed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
you
said
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
maybe
i
misunderstood
you
but
i
thought
that
your
argument
was
that,
what
appears
at
101
in
relation
to
this
issue
is
meaningless
because
it
was
not
followed
by
some
motion
to
amend
the
pleadings.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
but
that's
what
--
that's
your
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet
you
said
that
in
paragraph
9
and
you
signed
it
that
this
order
supplements
the
pleadings
and
governs
the
course
of
trial.
why
isn't
that
conclusive?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
conron,
when
did
the
--
these
proceedings,
was
that
they
filed
itself
--
it
was
narrowed
down
to
the
four
acts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
happened
after
the
trial
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
before
the
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
that
at
the
end
of
the
trial
when
all
the
evidence
was
in
that
you
have
the
arguments?
how
many
acts
were
actually
involved
for
purposes
of
section
8?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
--
but
that
the
ruling
was
not
until
the
end
of
the
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
page
94.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
conron,
(inaudible)
before
whom
was
this
trial,
judge
jertberg?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
allows
the
counsel
of
that,
the
pretrial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
not
together
but
by
government
counsel?
