versus

mr.
rowe.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
greene.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
does
the
man
know
what
--
what
term
he's
serving
if
they
are
not
specified
by
the
order
in
which
they
are
to
be
served?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
knows
he's
in
jail.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
does
he
know
or
does
he
know
what
he's
in
jail
for
at
the
particular
moment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
do
you
rest
it
on
that
grounds?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
we're
dealing
with
the
liberty
of
a
man,
is
it
too
much
to
expect
of
the
court
saying
those
things
specifically?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
suppose
--
suppose
you
have
two
accounts
or
two
--
two
indictments
that
he
is
sentenced
on,
and
there
is
no
certainty
as
to
which
one
is
serve
first
and
he
seeks
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
the
government
served
what
have
here
isn't
serving
on
this
one.
he's
serving
on
the
other
--
the
other
count
and
a
man
goes
before
the
lower
court.
the
court
says
â€œyes,
we
think
this
is
clear
enough.
we
think
that
a
defendant
can
divine
which
one
of
these
he
--
he
is
serving
at
this
particular
time
and
that
denies
him
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
because
he
is
--
he
is
serving
on
a
valid
--
valid
indictment.
then
he
has
to
come
all
the
way
up
to
this
court
in
order
to
get
that
reversed
and
then
the
meantime,
he's
doing
about
two
more
years
in
the
penitentiary
just
because
a
judge
has
been
imprecise
in
his
--
in
the
judgment.
now
is
that
any
material
thing?
is
that
a
slight
thing
so
far
the
rights
of
a
defendant
are
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
you
have
--
you
have
to
come
all
the
way
here
to
be
sure
of
what
his
rights
are?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
that
regard?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
i
understand
you
--
you
seek
to
confirm
the
sentence
by
saying
that
the
judge
must
be
precise
but
he
was
precise
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
if
that's
it,
alright,
but
you
use
the
word
imply
--
it
could
be
implied
that
this
was
true
so
that's
a
little
different
to
me.
if
--
if
you
say
that
the
court
marshal
should
be
precise
but
that
there
was
adequate
precision
here,
i
can
understand
very
--
very
well
what
your
position
is.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
case
where
--
where
once
i've
said
--
congress
said
it
was
12,
the
other
said
it
was
13,
the
judge
said
it
was
14,
and
then
it
ended
up
in
the
written
judgment
as
12.
is
that
the
case
you're
talking
about
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
sentence,
the
oral
sentence
he
gave
that
day
or
the
--
or
the
written
judgment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
the
written
judgment
cannot
alter
or
change
that
--
that
oral
statement.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
it
can
supply
certainty
that
--
that
it
wasn't
there
when
the
defendant
was
sentenced.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
record
show
this
was
signed
the
same
day?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
greene,
what
do
you
have
to
say
to
the
argument
of
mr.
rowe
that
in
the
case
that
you
rely
united
states
versus
doherty,
35
years
ago,
the
court
although
sustaining
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
said
this
and
similar
unfortunate
causes
should
it
manage
the
trial
courts
to
require
the
use
of
meticulously
precise
language
in
all
judgment
entries.
special
care
is
essential
where
sentences
for
crime
are
imposed
and
the
fact
that
nothing
has
happened
to
clarify
that
matter
and
that
it's
about
time
that
this
court
should
do
something
to
see
that
they
do
follow
that
admonition
that
was
given
and
in
the
case
you
rely
on.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rowe.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
think
and
also
in
effect,
is
it
not
that
the
time
for
appeal
runs
from
the
oral
sentence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
it
did
--
and
if
it
did
and
the
written
judgment
does
not
prepare
for
some
days
he
wouldn't
have
any
10
days
in
which
to
appeal
from
the
judgment,
would
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rowe,
before
you
sit
down,
i
should
like
to
express
the
appreciation
of
the
court
to
you
for
having
accepted
the
assignment
of
the
court
to
represent
this
indigent
defendant
as
public
service.we're
always
comforted
by
thought
that
lawyers
are
willing
to
take
such
cases
and
pursue
them
with
the
diligence
and
understanding
that
you
have.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
greene,
i
should
like
also
to
thank
you
for
the
diligence
and
the
helpfulness
that
you
rendered
to
the
court
in
representing
the
government
in
this
matter.
