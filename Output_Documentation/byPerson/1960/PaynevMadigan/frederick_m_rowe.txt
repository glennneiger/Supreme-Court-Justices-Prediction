mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
two
cases
which
have
been
consolidated
for
argument
are
here
by
writ
of
certiorari
respectively
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
the
petitioners
in
both
of
these
cases
are
prisoners
incarcerated
in
alcatraz
for
whom
counsel
has
been
appointed
by
this
court.
one
of
the
petitioners
enjoys
the
dubious
distinction
as
the
justice
department's
brief
points
out
with
some
evident
relish
of
once
having
been
in
the
list
of
the
fbi's
10
most
wanted
men.
but
the
case
and
the
issue
presented
by
these
cases
rise
beyond
the
faith
of
these
two
convicts
and
entails
a
broader
issue
and
an
important
issue
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
the
federal
courts,
a
field
over
which
this
court
has
traditionally
exercised
a
supervisory
jurisdiction
to
maintain
and
to
improve
the
standards
of
procedure.
basically
as
we
shall
go
on
to
detail,
the
fundamental
issue
in
both
cases
is
whether
a
judge
in
pronouncing
sentence
in
multiple
criminal
cases
must
impose
sentence
with
dignity
and
clarity
in
open
court
so
that
a
defendant
of
ordinary
intelligence
can
learn
from
the
sentencing
pronouncement
whether
with
respect
to
each
charge,
he
must
go
to
prison
and
if
so
for
how
long
and
when
in
relation
to
any
other
sentences
that
maybe
simultaneously
imposed.
without
resort
to
the
written
judgment
or
commitment
form
which
is
ordinarily
prepared
subsequently
by
the
clerk
and
signed
by
the
judge
after
the
conclusion
of
the
proceeding
in
open
court.
as
we
will
go
on
to
detail,
we
feel
that
such
a
requirement
that
sentences
be
pronounced
with
such
clarity
in
open
court
either
essential
not
only
to
protect
the
defendant
and
to
guarantee
him
the
rights
of
procedural
fairness,
but
also
to
maintain
the
dignity
of
the
judicial
procedure
in
imposing
criminal
sentences
and
to
stem
the
rising
tide
of
litigation
in
the
federal
courts
involving
challenges
by
petitioners
who
are
in
prison
to
obscure
and
rambling
pronouncements
of
sentence
by
federal
judges.
the
facts
in
both
of
these
cases
are
not
complex.
in
the
first
case,
number
180,
the
petitioner
payne
appeared
in
1956
before
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
tennessee
to
plead
guilty,
to
set
separate
information
and
one
indictment
charging
various
violations
of
the
postal
laws
over
a
period
of
several
years
in
various
courts
of
the
united
states.
he
agreed
to
transfer
of
his
sentence
and
waiver
of
trial
in
the
jurisdiction
in
tennessee
where
he
pleaded
guilty.
after
the
trial
judge
received
these
pleas
of
guilty,
he
proceeded
to
impose
sentence.
without
quoting
in
lengthy
detail
from
the
sentencing
pronouncement
by
the
judge,
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
sentencing
pronouncement
by
the
judge
created
as
the
court
of
appeals
below
put
it
some
confusion
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing
and
indeed
the
court
of
appeals
before
rendering
its
decision
below
suggested
that
some
administrative
procedure
be
taken
to
render
this
sentence
a
“intelligible
one.”
nevertheless,
there
was
some
misunderstanding
at
the
time
of
the
imposition
of
sentence
just
whether
the
judge
had
in
mind
12
years,
counsel
thought
13
years,
the
clerk
at
one
time
thought
a
different
period
of
years,
but
most
important
at
no
time
even
though
the
judge
used
the
word
consecutive
during
his
pronouncement,
at
no
time
did
he
specify
or
issue
any
direction
in
his
oral
pronouncement
just
when
anyone
of
these
multiple
sentences
were
to
be
served
by
the
defendant
in
relation
to
any
of
the
other
sentences
which
were
simultaneously
imposed
by
the
judge.
several
years
later,
having
commenced
the
service
of
the
sentence
in
alcatraz,
the
petitioner
sued
out
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
challenging
his
continued
detention
as
unlawful.
his
claim
was
that
in
as
much
as
the
judge
in
pronouncing
sentence
in
open
court
had
failed
to
specify
or
direct
the
sequence
of
anyone
of
these
sentences
or
their
commencement
date
of
service
that
by
operation
of
law,
all
of
these
sentences
must
begin
to
run
from
the
time
of
their
imposition
ie
-
need
to
run
concurrently
and
since
he
had
already
served
a
term
longer
than
the
longest
individual
term
of
these
multiple
sentences,
that
his
continued
detention
at
that
time
became
unlawful.
the
district
court
denied
his
claim
to
relief,
stating
that
it
felt
that
the
intention
of
the
district
judge
in
pronouncing
sentence
was
to
commit
him
for
12
years,
for
a
total
of
12
years
although
the
habeas
corpus
court
did
not
address
itself
to
the
question
at
all
as
to
one
--
anyone
of
these
sentences
was
to
be
served
in
relation
to
any
of
the
others.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
whose
decision
is
here
on
certiorari
affirmed
but
on
entirely
different
grounds.
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
held
that
the
sequence
of
service
of
multiple
sentences
was
a
matter
of
substance,
which
the
sentencing
judge
must
indicate.
however,
since
the
sentencing
judge
in
its
pronouncement
had
not
indicated
expressly
any
sequence
of
these
sentences
or
their
commencement
date
in
relation
to
each
other,
the
court
of
appeals
resorted
to
the
written
forms
of
judgment
and
commitment
which
were
prepared,
so
far
as
this
record
indicates,
after
the
close
of
the
proceeding
in
open
court
and
were
subsequently
signed
by
the
judge.
these
written
forms
of
judgment
and
commitment
which
as
a
matter
of
fact
were
not
in
the
original
record
of
this
case,
but
were
requested
by
the
court
of
appeals
during
oral
argument
and
were
then
supplied
by
the
u.s.
attorney
were
taken
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
specify
in
effect
the
missing
sequence
of
the
sentences
or
the
missing
commencement
dates
which
the
oral
pronouncement
of
the
judge
did
not
contain.
and
the
heart
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
is
contained
in
this
brief
excerpt
from
its
opinion
and
i
am
reading
from
page
18
of
the
record
in
the
payne
case,
number
180.
“whereas
here,
the
consecutive
sentences
pertain
to
six
information
and
an
indictment,
there
is
authority
for
the
view
that
a
more
precise
specification
of
the
order
of
sentences
must
be
indicated
than
is
to
be
found
in
the
instant
oral
sentences
in
providing
that
more
precise
specification
of
the
order
of
sentences,
the
written
judgments
and
commitments
entered
herein
did
not
deport
from
the
oral
pronouncements.
at
most,
they
resolved
in
ambiguity.
in
the
oral
pronouncements,
it
was
indicated
that
the
sentences
were
to
be
served
consecutively.
the
manner
in
which
the
pronouncements
were
made
indicates
that
a
sequence
of
sentences
corresponding
to
the
numerical
order
of
the
cases
was
probably
intended.
the
written
judgments
and
commitments
signed
by
the
judge
in
the
same
date
confirmed
this
inference.
in
our
view,
written
judgments
and
commitments
may
properly
serve
the
function
of
resolving
ambiguities
in
orally
pronounced
sentences.”
and
then
the
opinion
went
on
to
say,
“what
we
have
with
respect
to
the
sequence
of
sentences
has
equal
application
with
regard
to
the
clarification
of
the
total
time
to
be
served,
concerning
which
there
was
some
confusion
at
the
time
of
sentencing.”
the
facts
in
number
184,
the
young
case,
are
equally
simple.
in
that
case,
the
petitioner,
young,
appeared
before
the
federal
district
court
for
north
--
north
dakota
in
1952
to
plead
guilty
to
two
separate
information
and
one
indictment
alleging
the
larcenies
and
offences
against
the
united
states.
upon
receiving
those
guilty
pleas,
the
district
judge
for
north
dakota,
went
on
to
impose
separate
five-year
terms
upon
each
of
these
indictments
and
information.
in
this
sentencing
pronouncement
from
the
bench,
the
judge
did
say
and
did
use
the
word
consecutive.
the
judge
also
indicated
at
some
point
in
his
oral
pronouncement
that
he
contemplated
a
25-year
term
for
the
petitioner
young.
here
to
however,
the
judge
in
his
oral
pronouncement
at
no
time
indicated
the
sequence
of
anyone
of
these
multiple
sentences
in
relation
to
any
of
the
other
sentences
or
in
effect
to
fix
a
commencement
date
when
anyone
of
these
sentences
were
to
begin
running.
in
this
case,
the
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
well,
there
were
several
sentences.
there
were
five
sentences
imposed
by
the
judge.
at
no
time
did
the
judge
say
that
the
sentence
on
indictment
numbers
so
and
so
or
in
charge
number
so
and
so
will
begin
to
run
after
the
exploration
of
the
sentence
on
indictment
number
so
and
so
or
count
number
so
and
so.
however,
this
detail
which
the
judge's
oral
pronouncement
do
not
contain,
in
this
case
too
was
contained
in
the
written
form
of
judgment
and
commitment
which
is
part
of
the
record
in
this
case
number
184.
there
was
some
additional
element
of
confusion
in
this
particular
case,
number
184,
which
is
not
present
in
the
other
which
is
that
on
one
of
the
written
forms
of
judgment
and
commitment
specifies
that
two
separate
sentences
were
to
run
consecutive
with
each
other.
i
merely
point
this
out
for
the
sake
of
completeness
since
that
is
one
element
that
is
present
in
the
one
case
but
not
in
the
other.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
that,
of
course,
mr.
justice
harlan
is
a
question
which
involves
a
basic
distinction
between
the
chief
precedent
relied
on
by
the
department
of
justice,
the
doherty
case,
and
the
chief
precedent
relied
on
by
ourselves,
i
may
say
without
anticipating
in
my
argument
that
i
would
be
making
the
same
argument
of
multiple
counts
which
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
believe
that
that
comes
close
to
focusing
on
the
heart
of
the
case,
although
we
would
take
the
position
that
regardless
of
the
vitality
of
the
doherty
case,
we
are
entitled
to
prevail
because
we
have
multiple
indictments
here
rather
than
multiple
counts.
in
case
number
184,
the
petitioner
young
sought
relief
by
way
of
a
motion
to
correct
judgment
rather
than
by
way
of
habeas
corpus
as
the
petitioner
in
number
180
payne.
petitioner
young's
theory
was
that
the
written
judgment
should
be
conformed
--
to
conform
with
the
judge's
oral
pronouncement
and
in
as
much
as
the
judge's
oral
pronouncement
had
not
indicated
any
sequence
or
order
of
service
of
these
sentences
that
too
by
operation
of
law,
all
sentences
began
to
ran
from
the
time
of
their
imposition
and
that
since
the
written
judgments
and
commitment
forms
has
specified
a
different
sequence
of
service
that
these
written
forms
should
be
harmonized
with
the
oral
pronouncement
on
which
they
rested.
there
too
the
petitioner's
claim
for
relief
was
denied
by
the
district
court.
the
district
court
in
essence
felt
that
the
judge's
manner
in
pronouncing
the
sentence
on
petitioner
young
indicated
that
he
thought
that
these
sentences
should
be
served
in
the
particular
sequence
in
which
the
judge
took
up
these
various
indictments
and
information
and
pronounced
sentence
although
again,
the
district
judge
did
not
say
whether
the
sentence
was
to
run
in
that
sequence.
he
only
took
up
these
indictments
and
--
and
proceeded
to
impose
sentence
having
said
indictment
number
so
and
so,
so
many
years.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
again
affirmed
the
district
court's
ruling
and
it
too
held
that
the
overall
manner,
the
overall
way
in
which
the
district
judge
had
imposed
sentence
indicated
his
intention
that
the
sequence
of
service
of
the
sentences
was
to
be
in
the
same
sequence
in
which
he
had
taken
up
these
various
indictments
and
imposed
a
sentence
from
the
bench.
the
basic
issue
which
we
urge
before
the
court
on
the
basis
of
these
two
rulings
is
this.
we
maintain
essentially
that
a
federal
district
judge
in
pronouncing
sentence
in
court
on
multiple
criminal
charges
must
indicate
with
sufficient
clarity
when
each
sentence
is
to
begin
in
relation
to
the
others
that
he
imposes
at
the
same
time
so
that
a
defendant
of
ordinary
intelligence
will
learn
when
he
must
go
to
prison
in
relation
to
each
of
several
charges
on
which
he
is
being
simultaneously
sentenced
in
court.
and
we
further
maintain
as
we
will
detail
that
the
written
judgment
and
commitment
forms
which
are
clerically
prepared,
typically
after
the
close
of
the
proceeding
in
open
court,
cannot,
as
the
justice
department
urges,
be
use
to
help
understand
what
the
judge
has
pronounced
in
open
court
from
the
bench
because
this
--
such
a
resort
to
ministerial
and
clerical
forms
to
in
a
fact
improve
on
the
judge's
oral
pronouncement
would
not
only
debase
the
dignity
of
the
proceeding
in
open
court,
but
would
deprive
the
defendant
of
his
traditional
right
to
be
present
in
open
court
at
every
stage
of
the
proceeding,
including
the
stage
at
which
sentences
pronounced
upon
him
ie
-
the
general
issue
that
was
involved
in
the
green
case
upon
which
the
court
rendered
its
judgment
this
morning.
we
feel
furthermore
that
such
a
clear
cut
rule
by
this
court,
namely,
that
the
sequence
of
sentences
must
be
indicated
by
the
judge
in
open
court
will
improve
the
administration
of
judges
--
the
administration
of
justice
and
will
tend
to
abate
the
numerous
--
the
perhaps
flood
of
litigations
are
now
going
through
the
lower
federal
courts
based
on
challenges
by
prisoners
to
the
terms
of
a
district
judge's
sentencing
pronouncement
which
is
obscure
and
which
is
rambling
such
as
the
particular
sentencing
pronouncement
at
least
in
the
payne
case,
number
180.
for
authority,
for
argument,
we
start
back
with
the
patterson
decision
rendered
by
mr.
justice
bradley
of
this
court,
sitting
as
circuit
justice
in
1887.
in
that
case,
in
the
patterson
case,
mr.
justice
bradley
entertained
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
sued
out
a
--
by
a
prisoner
challenging
his
continued
detention
as
here
under
the
terms
of
a
sentencing
pronouncement
involving
separate
indictments
concerning
violations
of
the
federal
banking
laws.
the
sentencing
pronouncement
in
the
patterson
case
indicated
separate
terms
of
sentence
for
the
separate
indictments
involved
in
the
case
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
district
judge,
the
sentencing
judge
in
that
case
went
on
to
say
that
these
sentences
are
not
to
be
serve
concurrently.
nevertheless,
mr.
justice
bradley's
opinion
held
that
such
a
pronouncement
ineffectual
to
impose
consecutive
sentences
of
five
years
each
as
were
involved
in
that
case
on
the
ground
that
the
failure
to
specify
the
sequence,
the
order
in
which
these
sentences
were
to
be
serve
by
the
defendant,
rendered
the
sentencing
pronouncement
incapable
of
application
because
no
one
would
know
from
the
pronouncement
which
of
the
several
sentences
was
to
come
before
and
which
was
to
come
after
the
others
and
to
quote
briefly
from
mr.
justice
bradley's
opinion
in
the
patterson
case
in
1887
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
12
of
our
brief
in
the
payne
case
number
180.
according
to
mr.
justice
bradley's
opinion,
this
pronouncement
was
uncertain
and
incapable
of
application
for
no
intelligence
is
sufficient
to
answer
the
question
as
to
which
sentence
applied
to
which
of
the
several
indictments.
and
as
mr.
justice
bradley
viewed
the
situation
in
the
opinion,
he
said,
if
for
any
reason
peculiar
to
either
of
said
indictments
as
for
example
some
newly
discovered
evidence
should
be
a
different
face
put
upon
the
case
so
as
to
induce
the
executive
to
grant
the
prisoner
a
pardon
of
the
sentence
on
that
indictment,
no
person
could
affirm
which
of
the
three
terms
of
imprisonment
was
condoned.
if
a
formal
record
of
anyone
of
the
indictments
and
the
judgment
rendered
thereon
were
for
any
reason
required
to
be
made
out
and
exemplify,
no
clerk
or
person
skilled
in
the
law
could
extend
the
proper
judgment
upon
such
record.
he
could
not
tell
whether
it
was
a
sentence
for
the
first,
the
second,
or
the
last
term
of
imprisonment.
in
sum
and
mr.
justice
bradley's
opinion
in
the
patterson
case
held
that
a
prisoner
is
entitled
to
know
under
what
sentence
he
is
imprisoned
and
that
the
vague
words
of
the
opinion
characterized
him
in
question
which
did
indicate
that
the
sentences
were
not
run
concurrently
that
these
vague
words
were
insufficient
to
alter
the
legal
rule
that
each
sentence
is
to
commence
at
once
unless
otherwise
specially
ordered.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
traditionally,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
and
i
believe
still
today,
the
sole
judicial
force
so
far
as
a
prisoner's
rights
are
concerned
and
so
far
as
his
sentence
is
concerned
is
the
judge
--
judge's
oral
pronouncement
from
the
bench.
now
to
be
sure
this
oral
pronouncement
by
the
judge
is
recorded
in
various
ways
before
the
adoption
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
it
was
recorded
by
the
clerk
in
the
minutes.
now
under
the
rules,
there
is
a
form
called
judgment
and
commitment
which
is
recommended
by
the
rules
and
is
typically
used
by
the
district
courts
to
record
that
judgment
but
to
answer
your
question,
sir,
the
authority
on
which
a
prisoner's
sentence
rests
is
the
judge's
pronouncement
in
open
court.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
there
is
no
requirement
under
the
rules,
mr.
justice
clark,
that
the
prisoner
receive
a
copy
of
the
commitment.
there's
nothing
to
indicate
in
this
record
that
he
did
get
one.
we
all
have
been
operating
on
--
on
the
assumption
which
is
not
contradicted
by
the
record
that
he
does
not
get
one.
and
we
have
ascertained
from
the
district
court
here
and
the
district
of
columbia
that
the
practice
is
that
several
copies
of
the
form
are
prepared
none
of
which
is
given
to
the
prisoner,
one
of
which
is
retained
by
the
clerk
and
the
other
set
is
given
to
the
marshall
and
the
imprisoning
authorities
so
that
in
the
normal
course
of
the
events,
to
answer
your
question
sir,
the
prisoner
does
not
get
a
copy
of
that
form.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
there
is
no
question,
mr.
justice
whittaker
that
the
written
judgment
and
commitment
forms
are
authorized
and
are
responsive
to
rule
32.
the
question
however
is,
sir,
and
this
is
not
answered
by
the
rule
is
whether
these
written
forms
can
in
effect
embroider
and
improve
upon
and
amplify
what
the
judge
has
pronounced
in
open
court.
in
other
words
whether
the
clerk,
who
typically
prepares
these
forms,
can
in
filling
out
these
forms,
improve
on
the
judge's
pronouncement
by
in
effect
putting
things
in
there
which
the
judge
in
his
pronouncement
from
the
bench
did
not
say.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
that
interpretation
of
the
rule,
mr.
justice
whittaker
would
in
effect
revolutionize
the
traditional
function
of
the
sentencing
process
in
the
courts
because
traditionally
the
sentence
is
the
order
pronounced
by
the
judge
in
open
court
and
is
then
recorded
in
various
clerical
forms.
we
may
get
in
our
argument
to
the
discussion
of
the
hill
case
perhaps
where
this
court
held
in
the
1930s
that
the
clerk,
no
matter
what
the
rule
of
court
was,
was
not
authorized
to
improve
on
the
judge's
oral
pronouncement
which
was
recorded
in
exactly
the
same
fashion
as
he
pronounced
it
orally.
and
--
so
that
the
clerk
had
no
authority
to
go
beyond
in
effect
what
the
judge
has
said
and
what
was
recorded
in
open
court
and
this
is
precisely
the
rule
that
we're
urging
here.
we
rely
entirely
on
what
the
judge
said
and
what
was
recorded
in
open
court.
and
our
contention
is,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
that
the
clerical
forms
made
up
afterwards
cannot
differ
with,
cannot
depart
from,
cannot
amplify
what
the
judge
said
or
fill
in
any
omissions
by
the
judge
in
open
court
because
it
is
the
judge's
pronouncement
which
imposed
a
sentence
and
not
what
some
clerk
thought
the
judge
intended
to
say
even
though
he
didn't
say
it.
i
have
discussed
the
patterson
decision
in
which
mr.
justice
bradley
in
1887
laid
down
the
basic
ground
rule
and
in
which
the
opinion
in
effect
pronounced
a
rule
which
would
clearly
invalidate
the
decisions
below
because
under
the
patterson
rule,
even
the
judge's
use
of
the
words,
these
sentences
are
not
to
run
concurrently,
could
only
create
concurrent
sentences
when
he
failed
to
specify
when
each
of
the
sentences
was
to
begin
running
in
relation
to
any
of
the
others
on
separate
indictments
such
as
we
have
here.
now
to
be
sure,
in
1926,
this
court's
doherty
decision
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
mcreynolds
qualified
and
limited
the
scope
of
the
patterson
decision
of
mr.
justice
bradley.
in
the
doherty
case
in
1926,
they
were
involved
multiple
terms
of
imprisonment
imposed
on
three
counts
of
a
single
indictment.
the
judge
in
imposing
separate
sentences
on
these
three
counts
of
the
single
indictment
had
also
used
the
word
sentences
to
be
served
consecutive
but
had
not
specified
any
order
of
sequence
in
its
oral
pronouncement
as
to
which
any
of
the
three
sentences
was
to
begin
in
relation
to
the
others.
this
court
held
that
nevertheless
consecutive
sentences
were
authorized
to
run
in
the
same
sequence
as
the
sequence
of
the
several
counts
in
the
indictment.
and
the
opinion
by
mr.
justice
mcreynolds
said
that
the
only
fair
and
natural
implication
from
the
whole
judgment
was
that
the
sentences
were
to
run
in
the
same
order
as
the
numbers
of
the
three
counts
in
the
single
indictment
on
which
they
were
predicated.
however,
the
opinion
by
mr.
justice
mcreynolds
expressly
distinguished
the
patterson
case
and
said
it
presented
a
materially
different
question
because
here
there
were
only
multiple
counts
of
a
single
indictment
involved
whereas
in
doherty,
there
were
different
indictments
involved,
and
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
i
would
not
rest
my
case,
mr.
justice
harlan
on
the
profundity
of
the
distinction
drawn
by
mr.
justice
mcreynolds
opinion
in
the
doherty
case.
however,
there
is
a
distinction
insofar
as
when
there
are
several
counts
of
a
single
indictment.
ordinarily
one
may
assume
that
there
is
some
nexus
between
the
one
and
the
other
and
that
there's
some
logical
sequence
or
evolution
of
a
state
of
facts
where
counts
in
an
indictment
sets
forth
what
the
offense
is.
where
however
you
have
entirely
different
indictments
which
are
consolidated
for
sentencing
in
bulk
and
where
you
have
indictments
such
as
here
which
were
brought
in
different
jurisdictions,
there
is
no
necessary
relationship
whatsoever
between
one
indictment
and
another
indictment.
and
so
i
believe
one
may
say
with
some
force
that
when
several
indictments
are
involved,
the
lack
of
connection,
the
lack
of
rational
relationship
which
may
attend
this
process
requires
the
judge
to
be
extra
especially
careful
to
be
extra
explicit
in
making
clear
when
he
pronounce
his
sentence
when
each
of
the
sentences
on
these
different
indictments
is
to
be
served
in
relation
to
any
of
the
others
whereas
if
you
have
multiple
counts
of
a
single
indictment,
perhaps
some
inference
slander,
some
inference
nevertheless
maybe
drawn
from
the
counts
of
the
indictment
itself
the
way
they
are
phrased.
mr.
justice
mcreynolds'
opinion
in
the
doherty
case
did
go
on
to
say
that
there
were
unfortunate
causes
referring
to
this
type
of
prisoner's
litigation
before
the
court
and
that
the
judges
in
the
future
should
avoid
similar
unfortunate
causes
by
using
meticulously
precise
language
in
their
sentencing
pronouncements.
now
as
i
pointed
out
before
whatever
maybe
the
present
vitality,
the
present
validity
of
mr.
justice
mcreynolds'
doherty
opinion
in
1926
today,
after
35
years
of
intervening
experience,
our
case
fits
the
rule
of
the
patterson
case
not
of
the
doherty
case
because
here
we
do
have
multiple
indictments.
however,
i
may
go
on
to
say
that
even
though
we
can't
prevail
regardless
of
the
doherty
opinion,
this
court
may
well
wish
to
reassess
the
continuing
vitality
of
the
patterson
rule
promulgated
by
mr.
justice
mcreynolds
in
1926
in
the
light
of
supervening
experience
after
35
years
in
the
federal
courts.
and
that
supervening
experience,
if
i
may
suggest,
has
indicated
that
the
district
judges
apparently
have
no
uniformly
heeded
the
cautionary
and
monetary
words
if
by
mr.
justice
mcreynolds
and
have
not
used
meticulously
precise
language.
there
was
certainly
no
meticulously
precise
language
in
the
sentencing
pronouncements
here
and
that
the
volume
of
litigations
which
one
finds
in
just
perusing
the
west
digest
pertaining
to
this
particular
in
the
federal
courts
would
indicate
that
notwithstanding
the
exhortation
by
the
court
in
the
doherty
case,
there
is
still
a
sufficient
problem
of
district
judges
using
rambling
imprecise,
perhaps
even
sloppy
pronouncements
of
sentence
which
leave
the
petitioner
and
the
clerk
to
make
out
by
the
exercise
of
judgment
rather
than
to
make
out
from
the
words
of
the
judge
himself
just
what
the
sentence
is
and
when
each
of
several
sentences
has
to
begin
running
in
relation
to
the
others.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
no
sir
but
they
pronounced
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
that
is
correct
sir
but
nevertheless
at
all
time
and
i
don't
know
how
far
i
may
go
back
in
either
my
own
recollection
or
on
the
basis
of
what
the
common
law
was
with
some
feeling
of
accuracy,
nevertheless,
at
all
times,
there
was
an
oral
pronouncement
in
open
court
by
the
judge
which
was
recorded.
what
today
is
recorded
by
the
court
reporter
and
whose
record
is
reflected
really
in
the
record
of
these
cases.
this
is
the
pronouncement
made
by
the
judge
as
recorded
in
open
court.
now
to
be
sure
they're
after
a
various
steps
of
a
clerical,
a
ministerial
nature
take
place
now
as
before,
whereas
before
there
was
some
kind
of
minute
entry
made
by
the
clerk
on
the
basis
of
what
the
judge
said
in
open
court,
now
we
have
something
more
formal.
now
we
have
this
form
under
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
entitled
judgment
and
commitment
which
is
filled
out
typically
by
the
clerk
and
signed
by
the
judge
afterwards
which
gives
a
more
formal
evidence
really
of
what
it
is
that
the
judge
did
in
open
court,
but
at
no
time
either
before
or
after,
we
respectfully
submit,
does
the
force
spent
by
the
judicial
process
on
the
prisoner
come
from
any
other
source
but
the
judge's
oral
pronouncement
in
open
court,
because
without
this,
there
is
no
sentence
and
without
this,
there
is
no
judgment.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
my
answer
to
your
question,
sir,
would
be
that
rule
32
required
there'd
be
a
written
judgment
form.
however,
we
don't
believe
rule
32
or
any
decision
interpreting
rule
32
has
changed
the
traditional
principle
that
no
written
form
can
have
any
greater
validity
or
any
greater
force
than
the
judge's
pronouncement
on
which
it
rests
because
if
it
were
the
other
way,
if
it
were
the
written
form
that
would
control
rather
than
what
the
judge
says
in
effect,
we
would
be
doing
a
way
with
the
judge's
oral
pronouncement
and
all
we
would
need
is
a
clerical
form
filled
out
by
someone
in
the
clerk's
office
as
the
authority
for
the
detention
of
the
prisoner.
we
feel
the
interpretation
of
rule
32
for
which
we
contend
takes
account
of
the
historic
right
of
the
defendant
to
be
present
in
open
court
when
the
sentence
is
imposed
by
the
judge
rather
than
something
that
is
done
afterwards
ex
parte
not
in
the
presence
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
i
would
construe
it,
mr.
justice
black,
as
both
a
hope
and
an
admonition
but
in
either
event,
i
don't
believe
it
has
achieved
the
result.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
yes
sir,
there
was.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
well
without
expressing
myself
with
respect
to
either
the
majority
pronouncement
or
the
other
pronouncement
in
the
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
i
would
say
a
pronouncement
by
this
court
prospective
retrospective
whether
holding
or
dictum
is
a
word
to
the
wise
and
i
doubt
whether
a
district
judge,
whether
he
concentrated
on
the
words
of
the
minority
or
on
the
majority
opinion,
in
the
green
opinion
this
morning,
in
the
green
case
this
morning
would
feel
as
free
as
it
did
before
the
decision
of
the
court
was
rendered
to
disregard
and
ignore
the
rights
of
a
prisoner
so
far
as
his
rights
to
make
a
statement
in
open
court
is
concerned.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
no
sir,
because
we
maintain
that
it
would
--
that
it
would
tend
to
a
more
dignified
and
a
more
effective
administration
of
justice
as
well
as
to
a
greater
protection
of
the
rights
of
the
defendant
if
mr.
justice
mcreynolds
opinion
in
1926
were
in
effect
confined
to
its
own
particular
facts.
now
we
don't
need
such
a
holding
in
order
to
prevail
here
because
we
have
multiple
indictments
and
not
merely
multiple
counts
as
existed
in
the
doherty
case.
but
as
counsel
appointed
by
this
court
to
present
these
arguments,
i
would
say
in
all
candor
that
the
better
ruling
--
the
more
just
decision
by
this
court
regardless
now
of
whether
we
could
win
under
a
narrower
ruling
would
be
that
mr.
justice
mcreynolds'
opinion
in
the
doherty
case
should
be
confined
to
its
own
particular
facts
if
not
overruled
because
a
contrary
decision
by
this
court
today
would
be
more
consonant
with
fair
and
dignified
judicial
procedure
and
would
be
warranted
really
by
the
experience
in
the
interim
since
mr.
justice
mcreynolds'
opinion
which
have
not
born
out
the
hope
or
the
admonition
which
that
opinion
expressed
that
judges
should
use
meticulously
precise
language
because
in
many
cases,
they
have
not.
moreover
to
come
back
to
the
distinction
of
the
multiple
counts
and
the
multiple
indictment
problem,
where
in
doherty
they
have
a
multiple
counts
and
in
patterson
they
have
multiple
indictments,
we
believe
that
this
form
to
which
mr.
justice
whittaker
has
had
reference,
form
25
attended
to
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
indicates
that
even
where
there
are
multiple
counts
only
rather
than
multiple
indictments
there
should
be
a
clear
cut
specification
at
least
so
far
as
the
written
form
is
concerned
when
each
of
several
sentences
is
to
begin
and
end
in
relation
to
any
other.
in
other
words,
under
this
form
it
is
not
sufficient
to
say
consecutive
but
rather
the
form
requires
that
it
be
stated
thereon,
when
each
sentence
if
consecutive
is
to
really
run
in
relation
to
any
other.
in
other
words,
what
it
is
consecutive
too?
now
to
be
sure
this
form
25
appended
to
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
is
not
mandatory.
it
is
not
prescribed.
it
is
only
a
suggestion.
nevertheless,
we
feel
that
the
rule
was
promulgated
under
the
auspicious
of
this
court
and
indicate
certainly
what
the
better
practice
should
be
and
the
better
practice
we
feel
is
that
regardless
of
the
distinction
of
multiple
counts
and
multiple
indictments,
the
judge
should
be
clear
in
what
he
says
from
the
bench
when
he
tells
a
defendant
to
go
to
prison
just
when
he
is
supposed
to
be
going
with
respect
to
any
of
the
several
sentences
upon
which
he
is
being
simultaneously
sent
to
prison.
in
no
event
do
we
feel
however
that
this
form
which
is
clerically
prepared
and
signed
by
the
judge
typically
afterwards
that
in
no
event
should
this
form
be
use
to
construe
what
the
judge
meant
when
he
pronounced
sentence
in
open
court.
since
the
form
is
typically
prepared
in
the
absence
of
the
defendant
which
is
what
the
picture
is
that
emerges
from
this
record
to
have
the
form
control
the
substance,
to
have
the
form
rise
superior
to
the
judge's
pronouncement,
would
deprive
the
defendant
of
his
opportunity
to
be
there
at
every
step
of
the
way
which
culminates
in
the
sentencing
process.
in
other
words,
whatever
counts,
whatever
is
the
decisive
step
in
the
sentencing
process
that
must
be
where
the
defendant
is
present
(inaudible)
his
traditional
right
to
participate
in
the
criminal
process
is
frustrated.
and
so
we
feel
it
is
the
oral
pronouncement,
what
the
judge
says
from
the
bench
as
recorded
by
the
court
reporter
is
what
must
be
controlling
rather
than
that
this
written
clerical
form
prepared
afterwards.
we
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
realize
that
under
the
stress
of
a
judicial
proceeding,
we
cannot
expect
each
judicial
pronouncement
from
the
bench
in
a
criminal
case
to
be
a
model
of
clarity
and
precision.
nevertheless
however,
when
we
have
a
judicial
pronouncement
which
doesn't
even
say
when
each
of
several
sentences
has
to
begin
to
run
in
relation
to
any
of
the
others,
that
is
the
omission
or
shortcoming
which
i
don't
believe
the
written
form
may
properly
supply.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
it
means
to
me
only,
sir,
that
they
are
to
be
consecutive
that
being
the
intention
of
the
judge
without
however
expressing
any
kind
of
direction
which
of
these
perhaps
10
or
12
separate
pronouncements
here
has
to
come
before
and
which
is
to
come
after
any
of
the
others.
now
if
the
only
issue
was
how
many
years
the
judge
wanted
to
send
the
man
to
jail,
it
would
be
a
different
problem.
but
what
we
have
here
is
separate
offenses
and
separate
directions
and
separate
sentences
by
the
judge
so
that
we
can't
really
rest
by
checking
to
see
how
many
years
the
man
was
supposed
to
go
to
jail
and
there
were
separate
indictments
and
there
were
separate
sentences,
and
when
you
have
those
separate
pronouncements
by
the
judge,
we
feel
that
the
judge
should
be
sufficiently
clear
in
what
he
says
so
that
the
man
at
least
knows
whether
he
is
going
to
jail
first
on
the
indictment
which
happened
in
north
dakota
or
whether
he's
going
to
jail
first
on
the
information
which
happened
in
tennessee
to
make
up
some
examples.
because
after
all,
the
sentencing
function
is
not
only
a
mechanical
process
to
tell
a
man
to
go
to
jail
for
a
certain
number
of
years,
it
is
also
a
dignified
ritual
where
society
pronounces
its
judgment
upon
a
particular
defendant
standing
there
and
telling
him,
“this
is
what
you
have
done,
and
for
this
you
must
go
to
jail”.
and
to
us,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
this
ritual
function,
this
dignity
of
the
sentencing
process
is
frustrated
when
the
procedure
becomes
mechanized
to
the
point
that
where
the
judge
says,
well
consecutive
and
then
the
clerk
takes
over
and
fills
out
the
form.
now
we
feel
the
defendant
standing
there
at
the
bar
of
justice
has
a
right
and
should
know
under
our
system
of
jurisprudence
when
he
should
go
to
jail
for
what
particular
offense
and
that
the
judge
has
the
duty
to
make
that
clear
from
the
bench,
because
that
is
the
justification
really
for
the
judge's
function
to
be
exercised
in
this
manner.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
i
think
certainly
one
easy
way
the
he
could
use
to
clarity
what
he
wanted
to
say
is
to
say
the
end
of
it
that
it
is
my
further
direction
that
each
of
these
different
sentences
is
going
to
begin
running
as
soon
as
the
sentence
in
the
previous
numbered
indictments
expires
which
is
in
effect
what
the
written
form
of
judgment
and
commitment
said,
and
this
is
what
his
oral
pronouncement
omitted
to
state
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
whittaker
but
it
didn't
say
consecutive
to
what.
in
other
words,
you
can
say
there
are
five
different
sentences
all
to
be
consecutive
but
unless
it
is
a
matter
of
no
substance
whatsoever
which
goes
before
the
other,
the
failure
to
state
what
the
sequence
is
or
when
any
particular
one
begins
to
run
in
relation
to
the
other
is
a
defect.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
he
could
have
said
beginning
with
10,
7
--
676,
i
would
like
you
to
or
the
sentence
is
to
run
in
the
numerical
order
just
like
the
indictments
are
run
numerically
and
that
the
next
one
as
to
begin
when
the
last
one
leaves
off.
and
that
he
did
not
do
and
that
the
petitioner
in
effect
had
to
figure
out
from
himself
and
it
is
something
which
the
clerk
in
preparing
the
form
in
effect
also
had
to
figure
out
for
himself
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
no
sir
i
believe
the
word
consecutive
conveys
part
of
the
meaning
but
certainly
it's
only
part
of
it
and
not
the
whole.
the
whole
should
be
consecutive,
yes,
but
consecutive
to
what.
consecutive
two
after
one
or
three
after
two,
or
maybe
two
after
five,
because
there
can
be
reasons
why
a
judge
wouldn't
want
a
particular
sentence
regardless
of
what
the
numbers
on
the
indictment
were
to
run
first
or
to
run
last
for
reasons
that
are
within
his
discretion
and
for
reasons
that
are
on
his
own.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
i
think,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
that
would
certainly
be
good
and
careful
practice
because
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
well
he
could
prepare
notes
which
he
could
follow
and
certainly
give
the
defendant
his
right
to
speak
up
because
the
green
case,
of
course,
concerned
in
not
the
judge's
allocution
but
the
defendant's
allocution.
and
so
the
judge
could
draft
an
outline
which
he
could
revise
in
the
of
course
of
the
open
court
proceeding,
but
use
that
written
graph
as
a
guide
to
his
oral
pronouncement
rather
than
in
effect
as
the
judge
did
in
number
180,
if
i
may
use
the
word,
ramble
on.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
well
i
--
mr.
justice
whittaker
cannot
tell
from
this
record
just
what
the
claims
the
judge
may
have
had
with
the
case
previously.
it
maybe
that
this
is
the
first
time
he
saw
the
case
and
the
defendant,
but
nevertheless,
what
we
come
down
to
ultimately
is
really
how
careful
must
the
judge
be
in
imposing
sentence.
maybe
and
now
that
the
issue
is
before
this
court,
really
this
court's
pronouncement
will
determine
which
way
it
goes.
will
it
be
in
the
direction
of
requiring
greater
specificity
and
greater
care
by
the
district
judge
or
will
this
court's
sanction,
if
it
should
sanction
the
judgment
below,
give
greater
leeway
or
give
greater
authority
to
the
district
judges
to
more
or
less
be
on
their
own.
and
so
we
appeal
to
this
court's
supervisory
jurisdiction
in
elevating,
in
raising
the
standards
of
criminal
procedure
as
one
of
the
basic
grounds
on
which
we
would
urge
that
the
judgments
below
be
reversed
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
that
the
argument
for
the
department
of
justice
points
out
the
really
fundamental
issue
permeating
this
entire
case
which
is
whether
after
35
years
of
experience
with
the
doherty
decision
on
the
basis
of
developments
in
the
interim,
this
court
should
render
a
decision
which
either
raises
or
perhaps
lowers
the
required
standards
of
clearness
and
specificity
in
criminal
sentencing.
i
believe
those
are
the
basic
alternatives
because
if
on
the
one
hand
this
court
would
sanction
what
happened
in
these
cases
below
and
where
counsel
says
that
these
sentences
were
specific,
i
regret
to
say
some
they
were
not
specific
and
those
were
considered
specific.
and
then
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
i
believe
that
mr.
justice
clark
that
the
doherty
opinion
as
shown
by
the
developments
of
a
35
years
has
in
effect
given
too
much
leeway
to
the
trial
judges
which
they
have
not
employed
in
such
a
manner
as
to
have
required
specificity
in
the
sentences.
the
court
had
managed
in
effect
that
caution
that
exhorted
the
judges
to
use
meticulously
precise
language
but
certainly
it
has
shown
that
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
well
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
i
had
thought,
mr.
justice
clark
in
the
basis
of
the
briefs,
said
that
this
point
was
opened
but
i
believe
that
counsel
for
the
government
has
not
taken
the
position
which
he
might
have
taken
that
what
we
look
to
is
the
written
judgment
rather
than
the
oral
pronouncement
with
that
kind
of
state
his
case
has
specifically
for
him
did
have
the
clear
impression
that
what
he
was
saying
is
--
and
this
agrees
with
our
position
that
it
is
the
judge's
oral
pronouncement
in
open
court
which
controls
and
that
any
departures,
any
substantial
departures
in
the
written
form
from
what
the
judge
has
pronounced
an
oral
court
is
inconsequential
and
in
effect
null
and
void.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
quite
so
and
that
was
the
reason
why
we
urge
that
possession,
mr.
justice
whittaker
that
the
rule
must
not
be
and
cannot
be
lawfully
that
something
is
controlling
on
the
sentence
where
the
prisoner,
where
the
defendant
is
not
present
because
that
is
one
of
the
most
fundamental
guarantees
of
our
criminal
procedure
and
that
the
defendant
must
be
in
court,
must
be
present
when
that
happens
which
determines
whether
he
must
go
to
jail.
and
for
that
reason,
counsel's
concurrence
in
our
basic
position,
i
think,
simplifies
this
court's
decision
on
this
case.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
i,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
cannot
give
you
a
confident
answer
to
your
question.
i
would
believe
it
to
be
the
case
but
i
cannot
be
sure.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
that
is
correct,
sir.
traditionally,
it
is
what
the
judge
does
on
offense
rather
than
the
important
thing.
what
the
clerk
does
afterwards
--
afterwards
is
necessary,
is
useful,
and
must
be
done
by
somebody.
but
certainly,
nothing
that
the
clerk
does
can
rise
superior
in
authority
to
what
a
judge
does
on
the
bench
and
his
oral
pronouncement.
and
that
is
the
heart
of
our
contention,
of
course,
that
it
is
what
the
judge
said
and
not
what
the
clerk
did
afterwards
that
must
determine
how
long
and
when
these
petitioners
must
serve
their
sentences
that
were
imposed
in
open
court.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
the
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
there,
the
written
judgment
and
commitment
form,
as
we
understand
the
practice
is
executed
in
triplicate
or
quadruplicate
and
one
copy
is
given
to
the
martial
or
to
the
other
official
corresponding
to
a
martial
in
the
sentencing
court,
and
this
form
then,
this
copy
which
the
martial
has
is
the
authority
by
which
the
body
of
the
prisoner
is
delivered
to
prison.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
the
prisoner
himself
has
not
furnished
a
copy.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
the
prison
authority
has
a
copy.
yes
sir.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
it
is
signed
by
the
judge.
it
is
prepared
by
the
clerk
in
type
written
form
customarily
after
the
end
of
the
proceeding
on
the
basis
of
observations
made
by
the
clerk
when
he
sits
there,
and
the
subsequently,
the
judge
signs.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
in
this
case
it
was
on
the
same
day
but
there's
certainly
no
requirement
that
as
the
judge
signed
it
on
the
same
day
and
then
inquiring
of
the
local
district
court
as
to
their
procedure
that
we
were
told
that
it's
signed
by
the
judge
either
on
the
same
day
or
on
the
next
business
day
which
frequently
has
became
friday
and
monday,
yes.
as
i
started
to
say,
i
believe
this
decision
really
is
a
turning
point
insofar
as
whatever
decision
is
rendered
by
this
court
will
either
mean
that
the
standard
is
raised
upward
or
that
what
has
been
done
below
is
approved
and
so
the
necessary
tendency
will
be
that
any
leeway
that
trial
judges
felt
they
had
on
the
basis
of
the
doherty
case
to
render
pronouncements
such
as
were
rendered
by
the
district
judge
here
will
continue
and
to
our
mind
would
really
aggravate
a
continuing
problem
of
challenges
by
prisoners
in
the
courts
to
obscure
pronouncements
which
they
cannot
make
out
on
the
basis
of
the
judge's
own
words.
the
question
on
the
one
hand
is,
as
i
believe,
justice
department
counsel
has
put
it
whether
the
sentence
pronounced
by
the
judge
should
be
governed
by
what
the
fair
implication
is
or
what
the
reasonable
implication
is,
about
what
the
natural
inference
is,
i
think
we
must
recognize
that
defendants
appearing
in
court
for
a
sentence
on
a
criminal
charge
are
not
semantic
experts
that
they're
not
philosophers.
they're
people
of
normal,
if
not
subnormal
intelligence,
and
if
they
are
to
rely
on
natural
inferences
and
reasonable
understandings
or
fair
implications
of
what
the
judge
is
saying,
i
believe
they're
being
deprive
of
a
right
which
they
have
guaranteed
under
our
procedure
namely
to
find
out
when
they
go
to
court
to
be
sentenced,
when
they
must
go
to
prison,
and
if
so,
for
how
long,
and
when
in
relation
to
each
criminal
charge
on
which
they
have
been
brought
before
the
bar
of
justice.
counsel
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
believe
the
contention
that
habeas
corpus
was
not
a
proper
vehicle
for
securing
the
remedy
which
the
petitioner
in
number
180
sought.
it's
rather
a
belated
and
a
tardy
discovery
on
the
part
of
the
department
of
justice
because
it
was
never
urged
in
any
stage
of
the
proceedings
below
either
in
this
case
nor
in
any
other
case
that
we've
been
able
to
ascertain
and
certainly
no
court
has
ever
said
that
habeas
corpus
was
not
a
proper
remedy,
but
passing
up
that
aspect
of
the
situation
--
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
jurisdiction,
we
believe
that
in
effect
that
the
department
of
justice
has
answered
its
own
point
when
it
has
said
that
the
vital
incident
of
this
case
is
not
the
written
judgment
but
it
is
rather
the
oral
pronouncement
of
the
judge
in
open
court.
because
we
are
relying
on
the
essential
and
the
vital
incident,
the
judge's
oral
pronouncement
and
the
government
having
stated
that
this
is,
yes,
that
this
is
the
important
incident
in
the
procedure
is
now
precluded,
we
think,
from
saying
that
what
we
have
done
is
to
go
behind
the
judgment
of
the
court.
we're
not
going
behind
it,
we're
relying
on
it.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
yes
sir.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
oh
no,
sir.
i'm
sorry.
i
did
misunderstand
your
question
because
the
prisoner
who
sought
relief
by
way
of
habeas
corpus
did
move
in
the
southern
district
court
of
california.
and
there
is
no
question
but
that,
that
is
the
proper
venue
where
and
he
can
secure
relief
by
way
of
habeas
corpus.
the
north
dakota
incident
arose
when
the
one
prisoner
filed
a
motion
to
correct
the
judgment
with
the
sentencing
court
in
north
dakota.
he
didn't
file
habeas
corpus
in
north
dakota.
mr.
frederick
m.
rowe
so
the
question
to
which
you
eluded
and
which
i
misunderstood,
i
don't
believe
is
the
case.
but
counsel
did
raise
the
point
that
habeas
corpus
is
never
the
proper
remedy
in
these
proceedings.
and
our
position
there
is
that
when
counsel
has
agreed
with
us,
that
the
essential
act
as
the
judge's
oral
pronouncement,
then
habeas
corpus
is
necessarily
the
proper
remedy
because
we're
not
going
behind
the
judgment
of
the
court.
we
are
relying
on
the
judgment
of
the
court
when
we
say
that
when
the
district
judge
fails
to
specify
any
sequence
in
the
sentences
that
he
imposes
from
the
bench,
then
by
operation
of
law,
all
of
these
sentences
must
be
held
to
run
from
the
time
they
are
imposed
and
not
some
other
time.
and
with
respect
to
the
remedies
also
which
the
department
of
justice
has
suggested
in
effect
what
their
suggestion
adds
up
to
as
we
understand
it
is
if
the
test
is
the
natural
implication
of
the
reasonable
understanding
or
the
fair
meaning
of
what
the
judge
says
in
open
court
in
effect
the
prisoner
has
to
get
a
declaratory
judgment
sometime
later
to
find
out
from
the
judge
what
he
meant
the
first
time.
this
is
what
it
comes
down
to
unless
this
court
promulgates
a
rule
that
the
judge
has
to
pronounce
the
sentence
clearly
from
the
bench
in
such
a
manner
that
the
defendant
can
understand
it
the
first
time
around,
not
years
after
in
some
kind
of
declaratory
judgment
proceeding
because
if
every
prisoner
in
order
to
find
out
under
what
sentence
he
was
serving,
had
to
file
a
motion
whether
it's
called
a
motion
to
correct
the
inquiry
or
motion
to
correct
the
judgment
or
habeas
corpus,
then
the
district
courts
would
be
clogged
with
prisoners
trying
to
find
out
what
the
term
of
sentence
is
and
under
which
particular
judge
--
under
which
particular
charge
they
were
currently
serving
in
prison.
and
for
that
reason
we
believe
that
a
clear
cut
specific
vigorous
rule
is
necessary
in
the
case
of
this
kind
so
that
for
the
next
35
years,
we
will
not
have
the
problem
that
we
have
had
with
the
doherty
rule
for
the
last
35
years
that
namely,
if
the
court
fails
to
say
those
very
simple
few
words
which
apprise
the
prisoner
when
he
must
go
to
jail
of
any
particular
charge
in
that
event,
all
the
sentences
will
run
from
the
time
of
the
imposition
and
we
feel
that
such
a
rule
by
this
court
requiring
that
kind
of
specificity
will
not
only
raise
the
standards
of
judicial
procedure
but
will
ensure
unlike
the
doherty
experience
that
from
now
on
in
the
judges
will
be
as
precise
as
i
believe
counsel
for
the
department
of
justice
agrees
with
us,
they
should
be.
thank
you
very
much.
