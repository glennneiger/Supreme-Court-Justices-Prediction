justice
charles
e.
whittaker
was
that
evidence
(inaudible),
could
the
law
take
care
of
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
is
the
sentence
in
oral
of
that
commission
or
is
the
judgment
to
which
the
judge
is
the
statute
when
he's
given
the
(inaudible)
and
requires
the
judge
being
consolidated.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
judgment
of
conviction
shall
cut
forth
plea,
verdict
to
binding
and
the
adjudication
of
such
judgment
should
decide
by
a
judge
who
has
the
filing
clerk,
does
not
contemplate
a
written
judgment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i
am
wondering
if
this
rule
doesn't
make
the
judgment,
this
written
thing,
that's
defined
in
that
rule?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
rowe
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
i
was
(inaudible)
that
in
the
federal
court,
prior
to
the
adoption
of
rules
and
even
since
only
to
(inaudible)
federal
courts'
judgments
entered
no
judgments
at
all
of
record.
they
didn't
write
as
such,
did
they?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
the
court
could
speak
through
its
judgment
and
the
question
is
which
is
its
judgment
since
these
rules?
did
this
rule
32
change
the
law
so
as
to
require
the
judgment
to
be
in
right,
sign
of
the
judge?
is
that
the
judgment
or
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
two
or
three
word
per
word?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
--
what
strength
do
you
get
out
of
(inaudible)
in
this
page
180
saying
all
the
indifferent
indictments
will
be
consecutive,
would
have
been
(inaudible)
and
all
the
different
indictments
would
be
consecutive,
but
what
does
that
mean
to
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
this
is
in
fact
to
say
about
not
quite
those
words
well
we
did
to
say
that
all
the
different
indictments
will
be
consecutive.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
it
also
a
proof
that
as
in
this
very
case,
when
this
judge
got
on
the
bench
he
never
heard
(inaudible)
this
case
has
followed
an
indictment
to
this
(inaudible)
some
indictments
and
information,
some
most
of
which
were
involved
multiple
counts.
now
he's
got
to
sentence
him
at
that
time
or
hold
(inaudible)
while
he
figures
out
what
he's
got
to
do
with
it,
doesn't
he?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you?
do
you
rely
on
the
written
form
of
oral
pronouncement
alone
upon
the
ground
that
written
judgment
under
the
rule
32
is
not
the
â€œjudgment'
or
what
is
your
basis
to
this?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
is
your
position
that
(inaudible)
the
defendant
wasn't
present
then
the
written
sentence
was
witness
was
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
i
can
understand.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
that
wouldn't
raise
mr.
rowe's
point
however,
would
it,
where
he
contends
there's
much
more
here
than
a
mere
clerical
mistake,
does
he
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
maybe
i
misunderstood
--
i
understand
him
to
contend
that
these
sentences,
none
of
them
being
denominated
to
succeed
other
sentences
all
ran
concurrently
and
then
when
he'd
served
the
period
of
the
longest
when
he's
entitled
to
release.
isn't
that
his
claim?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
this
seems
--
this
seems
to
be
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
have
you
to
say,
sir,
in
respect
to
argue
--
the
argument
of
counsel
for
the
government
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
below
to
enter
an
order
of
habeas
corpus
with
respect
to
these
men
who
were
confined
in
alcatraz?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i'm
not
talking
about
proper
remedy.
i'm
talking
about
jurisdiction.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
think
i
had
made
myself
clear.
as
i
understand
in
the
habeas
corpus
case,
the
relief
can
only
be
granted
by
the
district
court
that
has
jurisdiction
of
the
person
or
the
district
the
person
or
the
accused
exists.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
these
men
were
incarcerated
in
alcatraz.
one
of
them
filed
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
in
north
dakota.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
not
habeas
corpus
(inaudible)
