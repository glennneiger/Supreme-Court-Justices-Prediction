mr.
harold
h.
greene
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
several
things
should
be
kept
in
mind
initially.
in
the
first
place,
it's
clear
beyond
any
doubt
that
the
court
here
said
in
both
cases,
said
and
meant
and
intended
and
everyone
understood
that
the
sentences
were
to
be
consecutive.
there's
no
question
about
that
at
all.
in
the
payne
case,
the
court
stated
“and
all
the
different
indictments
will
be
consecutive.”
we
computed
the
number
of
years
that
would
--
the
defendant
would
have
to
serve
and
it's
clear
that
indicated
that
the
sentences
would
be
consecutive
because
the
longest
individual
sentence
was
two
years
and
the
sentence
was
here
computed
at
12
and
in
one
instance
13
or
14
years.
in
the
young
case
similarly
the
court
said,
“it's
the
order
of
this
court
that
these
sentences
be
served
consecutively,
which
means
to
you
mr.
young
a
total
sentence
of
25
years
and
for
you
mrs.
young
a
total
sentence
of
20
years.”
now
on
the
second
place,
mr.
rowe
has
alluded
to
the
fact
that
the
court
made
an
error
in
addition,
he
at
one
time
talked
about
the
total
sentence
being
12
years
or
13
years
for
the
clerk
said
14
years.
i
think
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
that's
irrelevant
because
no
one
is
trying
to
keep
the
petitioner
beyond
12
years.
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
informed
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
sentence
has
been
construed
to
be
12
years.
he's
only
served
two
years
and
10
months.
so
that
the
mathematical
error
is,
i
think,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
issues
that
are
present
in
this
case.
now
it's
clear
from
all
of
this
that
if
the
lower
courts
ought
to
be
reversed
here,
it
would
not
be
because,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
courts
intended
or
said
to
everyone
understood
these
sentences
to
be
concurrent,
clearly
neither
courts
did
that.
it
would
only
be
because
there
maybe
a
rule
of
law
that
regardless
of
what
the
court
said
and
regardless
of
what
the
court
intended,
and
regardless
what
everyone
understood
the
court
to
mean,
the
sentences
should
be
concurrent
as
a
matter
of
law
where
the
sequence
of
service
of
the
various
consecutive
sentences
is
not
expressly
stated.
now
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well
he
knows
--
he
certainly
knows
the
total
term.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
yes.
no
he
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
as
i
will
try
to
show
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
in
this
case
while
the
--
in
these
both
of
these
cases,
while
the
sequence
was
not
expressly
stated,
the
sequence
of
service
was
certainly
--
it
was
implied
to
sufficient
clarity
to
inform
the
prisoner
and
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
--
suddenly
of
the
doherty
case
and
any
other
cases
in
which
--
which
might
have
been
dealing
with
the
subject.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
no
my
--
my
point
is
that
the
prisoner
here
did
know
from
the
way
--
from
the
manner
in
which
the
sentences
were
imposed,
from
the
way
the
court
imposed
these
sentences
in
numerical
and
chronological
order.
the
prisoner
did
know
and
everyone
there
must
have
understood,
if
i
may
anticipate
my
argument,
everyone
must
have
understood
when
the
court
said
your
sentence
on
indictment
number
1,
indictment
number
2,
indictment
number
3,
indictment
number
4
and
so
on,
all
these
sentences
to
be
consecutive,
it
seems
to
me
would
be
pretty
farfetched
to
assume
from
that,
that
the
court
intended
that
the
indictments
will
be
serve
number
six
first
and
then
number
three
and
then
number
four
and
then
number
one.
the
natural
implication
of
that
is,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
sentences
would
be
served
in
the
same
number
in
which
--
in
the
same
order
in
which
they
were
imposed
and
at
least
one
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
that
--
that
the
--
that
sentences
should
be
interpreted
in
that
way.
now
there
is
a
second
way
in
which
this
--
these
petitioners
could
tell
how
the
sentences
were
to
be
served
and
that
is
the
same
manner
as
was
done
in
the
doherty
case.
in
the
doherty
case,
there
was
no
--
no
specificity
at
all
as
to
the
various
counts.
but
the
court
--
this
court
held
unanimously
that
they
would
--
they
would
imply
from
the
fact
that
these
counts
in
the
indictment
are
numbered
one,
two,
and
three,
they
would
imply
from
that
and
infer
from
that,
that
the
sentences
were
to
be
served
in
the
same
order.
now
it
so
happens
in
this
--
in
both
of
these
cases
the
chronological
order,
the
numerical
order
and
the
order
of
imposition
were
the
same.
so
under
both
of
those
tests
of
implication,
the
prisoner
and
everyone
else
would
know
that
this
was
the
order
in
which
the
sentences
were
to
be
served.
now
it's
true,
i
concede
it
didn't
say
it
expressly,
but
the
question
here
is,
if
the
court
please,
whether
an
express
statement
of
the
order
must
be
made
and
whether
if
--
if
an
express
statement
is
not
made,
well
that's
fatal
to
the
consecutive
and
to
the
intention
of
the
court's
and
post
consecutive
sentences.
now
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
it
certainly
is
--
is
desirable
to
have
as
much
specificity
is
as
possible
and
--
and
we
certainly
don't
--
don't
come
here
to
argue
that
the
most
specificity
that
can
be
--
can
be
obtained
is
desirable,
but
these
--
all
we're
arguing
here
that
under
the
test
which
have
been
laid
down
by
the
court
thus
far
and
the
test
of
reasonableness,
these
sentences
were
amply
sufficient
to
impose
consecutive
sentences.
now
if
--
the
rule
that
that
regardless
of
the
intention
or
regardless
of
the
statement
of
the
sentencing
court,
the
rule
that
regardless
of
that,
the
sentences
must
be
made
concurrently
as
a
matter
of
law
comes
as
mr.
rowe
indicated
from
the
patterson
case
in
1887.
since
that
time,
there's
no
case
which
we
have
been
able
to
find
or
that
counsel
has
cited
except
the
dictum
in
one
case
that
the
courts
have
followed
the
rule
propounded
by
mr.
justice
bradley
in
district
court
in
the
patterson
case.
in
every
case
which
has
come
along
since
that
time
including
this
court
in
doherty,
the
courts
have
either
distinguished
the
patterson
case
or
it
flatly
refused
to
follow
it.
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
is
some
reason
for
this
reluctance
of
the
courts
to
go
along
with
the
patterson
case.
and
i
might
say
that
the
patterson
case
might
--
might
be
appropriate
on
its
own
peculiar
facts
because
there,
it
was
impossible
from
anything
the
court
said
to
deduce
the
order
of
--
in
which
the
sentences
were
to
be
served.
there
was
simply
one
sentence
and
he
said
they
were
all
to
be
serve
not
concurrently
but
there
was
no
--
none
is
here
a
--
the
order.
each
sentence
being
imposed
separately,
each
sentence
being
the
--
the
numbers
being
stated
separately,
the
type
of
offense
that's
involved
being
stated
separately.
all
of
those
things
were
absent
in
the
patterson
case.
and
because
of
that
perhaps
the
patterson
case
stands
up
as
appropriate
on
its
own
thoughts.
but
in
patterson
itself,
mr.
justice
bradley
said
if
materials
were
available
from
which
he
could
deduce
the
order
of
sequence
in
which
these
sentences
were
to
be
serve
at
least
he
under
made
it
the
decision
might
have
been
differently.
now
where
a
prisoner
is
complaining
about
not
knowing
the
order
of
consecutiveness,
what
is
he
really
complaining
about?
he
certainly
can't
show
any
tangible
present
prejudice.
it's
true,
it's
been
said
that
if
he
doesn't
know
which
sentence
he
is
serving,
he
can't
make
a
motion
perhaps
under
section
2255
if
he
feels
one
of
the
sentences
is
--
is
an
illegal
one
or
it's
been
said
in
--
in
--
i
believe
in
the
patterson
case,
and
counsel
states
also
that
he
can't
get
a
pardon.
if
he
wants
to
get
the
pardon
on
one
of
the
sentences,
not
on
the
others
so
the
executive
might
--
might
wish
to
give
him
the
pardon,
he
should
know
which
sentence
he
is
serving
or
more
basically
he
just
should
know
which
sentence
he
is
serving.
and
that's
certainly
true
but
the
remedy
for
that,
i
submit,
is
not
to
make
concurrent
as
a
matter
of
law,
what
is
consecutive
as
a
matter
of
fact.
the
remedy
for
that
is
to
let
him
know
which
sentence
he
is
serving.
the
remedy
doesn't
just
--
doesn't
fit
the
problem.
in
this
case
for
example,
in
the
payne
case,
he
now
knows
which
sentence
he
is
serving.
perhaps
if
--
even
if
you
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
originally
he
did
not
know,
that
originally
he
was
in
doubt
although
as
--
as
i
say,
i
feel
that
the
sentence
was
sufficiently
clear
to
make
him
understand,
to
make
everyone
else
understand
the
sequences
which
they
were
served,
but
then
if
he
goes
back
and
files
a
motion
--
you
know
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
or
motion
to
rule
36
which
we
suggest
is
the
proper
remedy
and
then
the
court
construes
the
sentence
then
he
knows
if
the
--
which
sentences
is
being
served.
i
don't
think
the
remedy
for
--
for
this
type
of
a
problem
where
no
present
tangible
prejudice
can
be
shown
except
merely
the
desire
to
know,
the
remedy
for
that
it
seems
to
me
is
not
to
wipe
out
the
intention
of
the
court
and
wipe
out
what
the
court
said
and
make
the
sentences
concurrent,
the
remedy
it
seems
to
me
is
to
let
the
prisoner
know
which
sentence
he
is
serving.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well
i
would
assume
mr.
chief
justice
that
if
he
came
to
the
court
complaining
about
not
knowing
which
sentence
he
is
serving,
the
sentencing
court
would
then
as
the
sentencing
court
did
in
these
cases
specify
if
there
is
no
insufficient
specificity.
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
arguing
here
that
if
nothing
whatever
is
said
in
any
of
the
sentences
with
respect
to
consecutiveness
or
if
nothing
is
said,
nothing
can
be
implied
with
respect
to
the
order
in
which
the
sentences
are
to
be
serve
that
there
might
not
be
some
right
to
--
to
have
the
sentences
serve
concurrently.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
in
this
particular
type
of
case
where
the
consecutiveness
itself,
the
consecutive
character
of
the
sentence
is
absolutely
clear
where
there
can
be
no
question
about
it
and
where
the
order
of
service
can
be
implied,
in
that
type
of
case
it
seems
to
me,
it
would
not
be
appropriate
simply
to
disregard
all
of
that,
and
to
say
that
notwithstanding
all
of
that,
the
sentences
should
be
made
concurrent.
in
that
type
of
case
it
seems
to
me
the
remedy
would
be
to,
if
there
is
this
lingering
doubt
which
on
these
facts,
i
don't
believe
there
is,
but
if
there
is
a
lingering
doubt,
the
remedy
would
be
to
find
out
from
the
sentencing
if
necessary
what
the
sequence
of
sentence
is.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well
i
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
the
sentencing
court
is
certainly
best
qualified,
and
best
equipped
to
determine
what
the
sentence
is.
now
sentence
is
a
sentencing
court.
the
sentencing
court
pronounced
the
sentence.
i
don't
believe
that
it
should
be
assumed
that
the
sentencing
court
will
not
properly
construe.
it
will
not
properly
tell
which
of
the
sente
--
in
which
order
the
sentences
were
to
be
imposed.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
yes.
our
principle
argument
is
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
yes.
yes
indeed.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
i
don't
want
to
--
i
don't'
want
to
mislead
the
court.
the
court
did
not
expressly
--
the
court
--
the
court
did
not
expressly
state
the
order
in
which
these
consecutive
sentences
were
to
be
served.
but
i
say
that
the
court
with
sufficient
precision
that
the
order
of
consecutiveness
can
be
implied
from
the
whole
entry
as
--
as
this
court
put
it
in
the
doherty
case.
this
court
said
in
that
case
that
if
the
order
of
consecutiveness
can
be
implied
from
the
whole
entry
that
is
sufficient
under
the
--
at
least
under
the
judgment
of
the
court
at
that
time.
in
the
doherty
case
itself
there
the
court
only
the
sole
sentence
of
the
court
was
this
and
i'm
quoting,
“the
prisoner
to
be
sentence
for
the
term
of
five
years
on
each
of
the
said
three
counts,
said
term
of
imprisonment
to
run
consecutively
and
not
concurrently,
that's
all
the
sentence
on
the
consecutive
part
that
the
court
impose
in
the
doherty
case
not
as
here
where
the
sentences
were
specifically
in
the
counts,
in
the
indictments
but
specifically
identified
each
by
number.
each
was
identified
by
subject
matter.
each
sentence
was
separately
imposed.
in
payne
when
the
court
in
number
180
when
the
court
intended
for
two
counts
to
run
the
sentences
in
two
counts
to
run
concurrently,
it
specifically
said
so.
in
both
cases
the
courts
added
up
the
total
number
of
years.
all
of
that
i
suggest
to
the
court
is
far
more
precision,
far
more
of
an
expression
by
the
courts
as
to
not
only
the
consecutive
character
of
the
sentences
but
also
the
order
in
which
those
sentences
were
to
be
serve.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
i'm
talking
about
both
cases.
this
is
certainly
one
of
those
cases.
there
was
some
confusion.
there
was
confusion
about
the
total
number
of
years
which
the
prisoner
was
to
serve.
but
as
i
indicated,
i
don't
think
that
this
confusion
as
to
--
in
the
addition
of
the
number
of
years
has
any
bearing
whatever
on
the
question
of
the
consecutiveness
of
the
sentences
and
the
order
in
which
the
sentences
were
to
be
served.
the
judge
may
have
been
wrong
in
adding
up
the
sentences
and
as
i
say
ultimately
the
petitioner
was
given
the
benefit
of
the
minimum
number
of
--
of
those
years,
but
i
don't
believe
that
this
is
a
confusion
if
it
was
that
or
just
poor
mathematical
ability
reflects
in
anyway
on
the
consecutive
character
of
the
sentences
or
on
the
--
on
the
order
in
which
they
were
to
be
served.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
he
ultimately
got
12
--
the
--
the
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
the
court
of
appeals
inquired
of
the
government
in
this
case
as
to
the
total
number
of
years
that
mr.
payne
wants
to
serve
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
advised
that
as
the
government
construed
the
sentences,
he
was
to
serve
12
years.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
12
years.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that
as
the
bureau
of
prisons
construed
these
sentences,
as
to
bureau
of
persons
understood
these
sentences
they
imposed
no
more
than
12
years.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
no,
the
judge
i
don't
--
i
believe
the
14
years
was
simply
someone
stated
14
years
but
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that's
what
the
court
said
but
as
i
indicated,
the
court
may
have
been
a
poor
mathematician
but
he
didn't
--
he
at
no
time
imposed
14
years
on
the
specific
sentences
that
he
--
that
he
imposed
ov
each
specific
counts.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
no
your
honor.
the
--
the
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well
the
confusion
that
arose
came
in
on
--
on
sentence
on
10681
on
the
indictment
on
10681.
if
you
will
refer
to
--
on
page
7
to
where
the
court
for
the
first
time,
where
the
court
imposed
actually
imposed
the
sentences
on
--
on
indictment
number
10681,
he
said
one
year
on
each
count
concurrent.
then
when
you
recapitulate
on
page
8,
he
said
on
10681
two
years
and
that's
where
the
confusion
came
in.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well
it
was
repeated
at
that
time
the
original,
the
sentence
that
was
originally
imposed
what
we
consider
to
be
the
proper
sentence
was
12
years.
the
written
judgments
that
were
made
out
contained
only
12
years
and
when
the
bureau
of
prison
was
asked
in
the
--
the
government
was
asked
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
what
they
considered
to
be
the
sentence,
they
said
12
years
and
i've
come
--
from
all
of
that,
we
believe
that
12
years
is
the
--
is
the
sentence
that
was
imposed
here
but
all
of
that
doesn't
go
to
the
question
on
whether
the
sentences
were
to
be
consecutive
or
concurrent
because
the
largest
single
sentence
was
two
years,
the
largest
single
separate
sentence.
so
it
--
it
couldn't
have
been
--
he
couldn't
have
meant
whether
it
was
12
or
14
years,
he
couldn't
have
been
concurrent
under
either
and
under
any
of
the
interpretations.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
we
would
agree
that
the
sentence
of
the
court
is
the
oral
sentence.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
the
written
judgment,
we
believe,
if
it
differs
in
a
matter
of
substance
from
the
oral
sentence,
it
is
void,
it
cannot
--
it
cannot
change
that.
however,
we
do
argue
that
the
written
judgment
can
be
used
to
resolve
an
ambiguity
if
there
is
an
ambiguity,
but
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
it
can
supply
certainty
where
--
well,
in
these
cases
where
the
implication
from
the
whole
entry
was
that
these
sentences
were
to
be
consecutive
in
a
certain
order,
then
i
think
the
written
judgments
can
be
use
to
confirm
that
that
implication
if
further
confirmation
is
necessary.
we
don't
say
in
--
the
only
cases
have
been
cited
are
cases
in
which
the
written
judgment
totally
differs
from
the
oral
pronouncement.
if
that
so,
certainly
the
written
judgment
cannot
vary
and
cannot
overcome
the
oral
sentence.
but
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
should
close
the
eyes
to
the
written
judgment
where
it
was
signed
and
entered
at
the
same
day
by
the
same
judge
who
--
who
pronounced
the
oral
sentence.
but
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
yes.
now
let
me
--
let
me
emphasize
that
we
do
not
rely
on
the
written
judgments
initially.
we
only
rely
on
the
written
judgments
in
the
alternative
and
only
on
the
assumption
that
our
principle
argument
may
not
be
accepted.
i
believe
that
--
that
on
our
principle
argument,
that
the
oral
sentences
themselves
were
sufficient
to
impose
consecutive
sentences,
we
really
never
need
to
refer
to
the
problem
of
where
the
written
judgments
can
be
use
for
that
purpose
or
not.
now
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
the
oral
sentence
is
certainly
the
sentence
known
to
the
law
as
the
sentence
of
the
courts.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
i
think
there
would
be
great
difficulty
in
maintaining
the
position
that
the
written
judgment
was
the
judgment
of
the
court
and
which
supersede
the
oral
sentence
because
of
the
fact
that
the
defendant
is
not
present,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
yes.
it's
in
the
record.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
in
the
two
cases
of
course
in
the
--
in
the
payne
phase,
the
written
judgments
didn't
get
into
the
--
into
the
court
until
the
time
that
the
court
of
appeals
asked
for
them.
in
the
young
case,
the
written
judgments
were
there
right
from
the
beginning
because
this
was
in
the
sentencing
court.
the
young
motion
was
brought
into
sentencing
court.
in
the
payne
case,
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
brought
in
a
--
in
a
district
other
than
the
sentencing
court
and
therefore,
there
was
--
there
was
some
difficulty
about
getting
the
records.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
i
just
don't
know.
now
some
argument
is
made
that
the
doherty
case
should
not
control
here
because
they're
with
different
counts
of
an
indictment
were
involved
and
here
we
have
different
indictments
and
that
this
should
make
some
difference.
now
it's
true
that
indoor
may
the
court
referred
to
the
patterson
case,
mr.
justice
bradley's
opinion
and
said
that
the
question
was
different
in
that
case.
but
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
can
be
construed
as
an
endorsement
of
patterson.
at
best,
it
was
simply
a
way
of
not
overruling
the
case
where
it
wasn't
absolutely
necessary.
but
whatever
maybe
the
merits
of
that,
i
think
as
a
matter
of
substance,
no
tenable
distinction
can
be
made
between
different
counts
of
an
indictment
and
different
indictments
in
this
--
on
this
type
of
question.
the
seven
court
of
appeals
decisions
in
three
circuits
which
have
dealt
with
this
problem,
not
one
has
been
able
to
see
and
has
been
able
to
decide
the
question
on
the
basis
of
that
distinction.
the
only
thing
the
petitioners
point
to
is
that
multiple
counts
in
one
indictment
typically
have
to
deal
with
transgression
and
that
because
of
that,
this
factor
of
one
transgression
might
clarify
the
sequence
in
which
the
sentences
are
to
be
served.
i
think
both
of
these
suppositions
and
propositions
are
erroneous.
in
the
first
place
on
the
rule
8
(a),
you
can
join
in
one
indictment
and
various
counts
a
number
of
criminal
acts
whether
they
occur
out
of
one
--
one
transgression
or
not,
as
long
as
they
are
the
same
with
similar
character.
except
for
the
fact
that
in
this
case,
the
indictments
came
from
different
districts,
i
suppose,
these
--
these
offenses
could
have
been
tried
to
the
counts
of
one
indictment.
so
to
make
the
clarity
of
the
sentences
depend
on
that,
seems
unrealistic,
but
even
if
the
different
--
even
if
the
different
counts
came
from
one
transgression
if
you
had
only
a
single
indictment.
i
don't
believe
that
would
prove
anything
as
to
the
sequence
in
which
the
sentences
were
to
be
served.
supposing
for
example
on
narcotics
case,
one
count
charged
the
illegal
possession
without
a
written
order
form.
without
more,
i
don't
believe
from
that
you
could
deduce
the
order
or
the
sequence
in
which
sentences
on
these
two
counts
were
to
be
served.
so
the
distinction
that
petitioners
try
to
draw
between
counts
of
one
indictment,
in
different
indictments
for
these
purposes
simply
is
untenable
and
if
doherty
is
still
the
law,
it
would
have
to
of
course
apply
to
both
situations.
mention
has
been
made
upon
25%
which
is
attached
to
the
criminal
rules
and
it's
true
that
in
form
25
or
footnote
to
the
forms
says
that
the
form
--
the
court
in
preparing
the
judgments
should
give
the
order
or
the
sequence
in
which
the
sentences
are
to
be
served,
but
two
things
ought
to
be
born.
in
the
first
place
under
rule
58,
the
forms
themselves
are
only
illustrative
and
not
mandatory.
in
the
second
place
form
25
applies
to
the
written
judgment
under
rule
32
(b).
it
doesn't
apply
to
the
oral
sentence
under
rule
32
(a).
so
to
make
an
illustrative
form
which
applies
to
written
judgments,
to
make
that
mandatory
for
oral
sentences
seems
--
seems
again
not
--
not
appropriate.
let
me
just
allude
briefly
to
a
question
of
jurisdiction
which
arises
out
of
the
peculiar
way
in
which
these
cases
came
out.
the
young
case,
number
180,
came
up
by
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
in
which
the
petitioner
was
confined.
on
the
other
hand,
the
payne
case,
number
184,
came
up
by
a
motion
to
correct
sentence
in
the
district
in
which
he
was
sentenced.
now
the
petitioners'
claim
that
they
can
properly
bring
either
a
motion
under
section
2255
of
title
28
or
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
raise
the
same
issue.
now
section
2255
specifically
provides
in
the
last
paragraph
that
it's
--
you
cannot
apply
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
unless
a
motion
under
section
2255
is
unavailable.
in
other
words
the
two
remedies
are
mutually
exclusive.
so
i
don't
believe
it's
possible
to
bring
the
same
question
up
in
the
--
in
two
different
districts.
also
the
habeas
corpus
petition
isn't
proper
because
on
a
collateral
attack
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
hill
case,
on
the
collateral
attack,
the
judgment
of
the
courts
is
the
judgment
and
no
--
no
court
in
any
other
district
can
go
behind
that
judgment.
for
those
purposes,
the
written
judgments,
the
judgment
under
rule
32
(b)
is
the
judgment
of
the
court
and
not
the
oral
sentence
as
the
hill
case
makes
quite
clear
although
in
the
hill
case
it
didn't
have
a
written
judgment
but
you
had
the
equivalent
of
docket
entry
signed
by
the
court.
so
that
for
that
reason
alone
in
the
payne
case
for
jurisdictional
reasons,
the
petitioner
could
not
raise
this
question
in
the
courts
in
the
manner
in
which
he
did.
we
believe
the
appropriate
manner
and
the
proper
manner
to
raise
this
kind
of
a
question
is
by
a
motion
to
correct
under
rule
36
which
is
a
motion
to
correct
clerical
errors
or
omissions
if
--
if
in
fact
the
written
judgment
departs
in
that
manner
from
what
the
true
sentence
of
the
court
is,
then
a
motion
under
rule
36
would
lie.
and
while
the
petitioner
in
young
didn't
call
his
motion,
a
motion
under
rule
36
apparently,
he
thought
he
was
filing
a
motion
under
rule
2255
--
under
section
2255.
i
think
his
motion
can
be
construed
to
be
a
motion
under
the
rule
36
because
at
least
it
was
in
the
sentencing
court
and
the
court
which
has
the
papers
there
which
has
the
judgment
and
which
it
entered
the
judgment,
and
this
judgment
should
be
good
against
the
whole
world.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well
he
would
contend,
i
believe,
that
there
is
a
clerical
mistake
in
that
the
written
judgment
doesn't
correctly
reflect
the
true
sentence
of
the
court.
he
would
say
that
the
true
sentence
of
the
court
was
that
the
sentences
were
to
be
concurrent
and
since
the
written
judgment
doesn't
provide
for
concurrent
sentences
the
written
judgment
was
in
error
and
should
be
corrected
to
reflect
--
to
intent
in
the
two
judgment
of
the
court.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that's
right,
but
he
is
entitled
to
that
release
under
the
oral
sentences,
under
the
sentences
that
were
imposed
orally.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
written
judgments
do
not
conform
to
that,
they're
obviously
an
error
if
he
is
correct
on
the
merits
on
the
substance
of
his
claim.
and
i
suggest
that
a
motion
under
rule
36
is
a
good
a
way
of
raising
this
--
this
problem
as
any
particularly
since
habeas
corpus
is
unavailable
because
it's
in
the
different
districts,
district
and
particularly
also
since
the
motion
under
section
2257,
i
believe,
is
also
unavailable,
because
it
only
goes
to
illegal
sentences
and
this
sentence
is
not
illegal.
it
merely
says
he
serve
the
full
term.
so
he
obviously
must
have
some
remedy,
and
i
suggest
to
the
motion
under
rule
36
would
be
the
appropriate
remedy.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
number
one,
i
think
as
i've
indicated,
i
believe
these
cases
are
much
more
precise
than
the
judgment
and
the
sentences
that
were
imposed
in
the
doherty
case.
so
to
that
extent
the
district
court
here
did
comply
with
the
admonition
of
the
court
in
the
doherty
case.
also
since
that
time
we
have
of
course
had
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
and
form
25
which
in
the
written
judgment
at
least,
sets
forth
precisely
all
of
the
things
in
--
in
both
as
to
consecutiveness
in
order
of
sentence
in
a
very
precise
and
meticulous
manner.
all
that
i'm
suggesting
is
that
you
cannot
expect
in
a
--
in
a
--
in
oral
pronouncement,
it
will
be
difficult
to
expect
the
same
kind
of
precision
as
you
would
have
in
the
written
judgment
unless
the
whole
thing
were
written
out
in
advance.
so
to
answer
your
question
quickly,
i
believe
that
these
sentences
all
much
clearer
than
the
sentences
in
the
doherty
case
and
they
clearly
set
forth
the
consecutive
character
and
the
order
of
consecutiveness
and
that's
about
what
could
be
expected.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well
in
this
--
yes.
well
in
this
sent
--
in
this
sentence,
the
court
treated
separately
each
of
the
various
indictments
and
discussed
each
of
the
various
indictments
by
number
and
by
subject
matter
and
then
at
the
end
said,
after
discussing
them
all
in
that
order,
he
said
now
all
of
--
all
of
the
sentences
should
be
a
consecutive.
the
--
the
implication
from
that
--
the
much
clearer
implication
from
that
is
that
there
would
be
consecutive
in
the
order
in
which
they
were
imposed.
whereas
in
doherty,
all
you
had
was
the
--
the
pronouncement
said
term,
i
believe
the
court
didn't
even
use
the
plural,
he
said,
said
term
of
imprisonment
to
run
consecutively
not
concurrently
which
is
a
much
vaguer
pronouncement
than
what
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
i
believe
that
no
tenable,
no
rational
distinction
can
be
drawn
at
least
none
has
been
suggested
that
would
--
would
make
sense
with
--
for
these
purposes.
you
would
have
distinction
between
counts
and
indictments
because
in
many
instances,
you
could
have
--
you
could
bring
the
same
kind
of
charge
on
indict
--
on
different
indictments
or
different
counts.
and
to
make
the
clarity
of
the
sentence
depends
upon
whether
similar
offenses
--
a
series
of
offenses
were
charged
in
one
indictment
and
in
one
number
or
in
several
indictments
for
several
--
several
in
number.
i
just
don't
believe
it
can
be
done
because
the
fact
that
different
counts
different
indictments
are
involved
doesn't
illuminate
at
all
the
sequence
in
which
the
sentences
are
to
be
served.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
nealy
case
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
there's
no
question,
mr.
justice
black,
but
that
in
the
doherty
case,
the
court
said
about
the
--
what
the
court
said
about
the
patterson
case
and
nealy
case
was
that,
it
was
not
addressing
itself
to
insofar
as
--
as
its
rule
in
this
case
was
concerned.
it
didn't
mean
to
apply
it
to
counts,
but
what
i'm
suggesting
is,
it
didn't
mean
to
apply
different
indictment.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
no
rational
distinction
can
be
drawn,
so
either
you'll
have
to
go
back
to
do
--
to
the
old
patterson
rule
and
--
and
hold
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
these
sentences
are
ought
to
be
concurrent
regardless
of
the
--
of
what
the
court
said
and
what
the
court
intended
or
doherty
would
have
to
be
held
to
apply
to
both
counts
and
indictments.
