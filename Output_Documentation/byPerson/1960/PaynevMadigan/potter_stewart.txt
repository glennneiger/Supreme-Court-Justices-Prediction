if
he
did
that,

would
take
any
benefit
away
from
the
allocution
which

mentioned
in
the

from
anything
happens

sentencing
procedures.
he
made
up
his
mind

began
revising

and
he'd
certainly
be
in
danger

was
signed
not
by
the
clerk,
it's
signed
by
the
judge.

potter
stewart
entered

the
same
day.
