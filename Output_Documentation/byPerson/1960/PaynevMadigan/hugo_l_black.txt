justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
states
would
rather
suggest
that
mcreynolds
should
be
construed
merely
a
hope
that
judges
would
be
particular
said
after
all
that
they
should.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
there
was
an
opinion
came
down
this
morning
similar
to
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
judge
that
thereafter
the
court
could
with
impunity
violate
what
the
court
said
must
be
put
in
the
--
in
the
chance
must
be
--
must
be
given
to
defendant
when
he
is
convicted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
i
was
accepting
if
majority
wholly
and
accepting
the
statement
as
they
were
saying
theoretical,
they
can
do
it
the
other
way,
would
you
say
that
after
that
statement
the
courts
to
go
ahead
with
impunity
to
refuse
to
allow
to
solicit
personally
the
statement
of
the
defendants?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if
that
is
to
be
accepted
as
a
--
as
a
holding
that
theoretically
that
has
to
--
you
have
to
give
him
that
personal
chance,
would
the
same
rule
apply
or
should
the
same
reasoning
be
given
in
connection
with
this
holding
of
justice
mcreynolds
in
the
courts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
government
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
they
were
--
the
court
of
appeals
was
advised
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
i
don't
understand.
it
seems
to
me
like
it
was
14
under
the
--
and
the
judge
said
14
and
there
were
seven
cases.
what
was
that
basis?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
you
said
the
court.
i
figured
14.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
why
it's
clearer
than
the
doherty
case,
is
that
it?
i'm
not
sure
that
that
settles
the
case
though
but
i
was
just
reading
the
doherty
sentence
for
the
term
of
five
years
which
was
set
on
three
counts
as
i
believe
he's
been
discharged
that
terms
(inaudible)
consecutively
and
concurrently.
i
don't
understand
why
you
say
this
senate
is
clearer
than
the
doherty
case
with
reference
to
the
affirmance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
do
you
say
about
the
effect
as
doherty
case
distinguished
between
the
counts
and
the
indictments?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
pretty
clear
whether
that's
right
or
not,
the
court
in
doherty
thought
it
made
it.
(inaudible)
the
fact
not
merely
what
you've
said
--
in
fact
you
said,
we
think
the
reason
of
that
opinion
is
not
applicable
to
present
situation.
nealy
versus
united
states
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
was
based
upon
the
fact
that's
otherwise
different
not
different
indictment.
