mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
may
it
please
the
court.
the
first
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
traditional
employee
referral
agreement,
sometimes
referred
to
or
called
the
union
hiring
halls,
under
which
an
employer
agrees
to
obtain
his
workforce
exclusively
through
the
union,
violates
the
taft-hartley
act
and
this,
even
though
the
agreement
is
non-discriminatory
on
its
face,
unless
the
parties
to
the
agreement
include
in
the
agreement
certain
safeguards
which
are
--
which
had
been
prescribed
by
the
board
and
which
i
will
indicate
later.
a
second
issue
is
whether,
assuming
this
agreement
to
be
invalid,
the
board,
in
framing
a
remedy,
can
require
the
union
to
return
to
all
its
--
its
members
hired
under
the
referral
agreement,
their
dues
and
initiation
fees
during
a
term
of
the
agreement
and
for
a
period
of
six
months
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
charges.
that
issue
is
also
involved
in
case
number
68,
local
60,
brotherhood
of
carpenters
which
follows
this
case
and
which
has
been
consolidated
with
this
case
for
purpose
of
argument
by
arrangement
of
counsel
and
consent
of
this
court,
mr.
dunau
will
argue
that
issue
in
the
next
case
which
is
in
both
these
cases.
the
sections
of
the
law
which
are
claimed
to
be
violated
by
the
referral
agreement
in
this
case
are
sections
8
(a)
(3)
and
8
(b)
(2)
which
forbid
an
employer
or
a
union
to
discriminate
employ
--
in
employment
so
as
to
encourage
or
discourage
union
membership.
the
board
says
the
referral
agreements,
any
referral
agreement,
any
hiring
hall
inherently
and
ipso
facto,
operates
to
encourage
union
membership.
the
hiring
hall
or
referral
system
which
--
under
which
employment
is
channeled
exclusively
through
the
union
has,
as
this
court
is
undoubtedly
aware,
been
and
used
in
operation
for
many
years
in
such
industries
as
the
building
trade,
maritime,
stevedoring
and
some
aspects
of
transportation
where
--
where
the
employment
conditions
are
transitory
--
transitory
or
irregular
and
the
--
where
in
the
absence
of
a
central
referring
--
referral
place
such
as
the
union
hall
or
the
hiring
hall,
the
workers
involved,
usually
craftsmen
have
to
spend
their
time
haphazardly
searching
for
employment.
and
the
employer
who
needs
a
qualified
workforce,
a
skilled
workforce
has
to
have
an
equally
or
has
an
equality
haphazard
search
for
that
working
force.
the
salutary
effects
of
the
hiring
hall
in
solving
the
employment
problems
peculiar
to
these
particular
industries
had
been
noted
by
leading
economists,
by
the
members
of
management
and
labor,
by
members
of
congress,
by
the
courts
and
indeed
by
the
labor
board
here
itself,
the
board's
brief
had
meant
as
much.
now,
the
issue
of
the
legality
of
the
referral
agreements
in
this
case
arose
in
the
following
factual
posture
which
is
not
in
dispute.
in
1955,
the
petitioning
union
here,
local
357
of
the
teamsters,
along
with
some
other
15
locals
in
the
southern
california
area
entered
into
a
three-year
collective
agreements
with
a
trucking
association,
california
trucking
association,
representing
some
1000
carriers
in
the
southern
--
middle
california
and
southern
california
area.
and
the
particular
employer,
respondent
in
this
case,
seattle
or
los
angeles-seattle
motor
express
company,
is
one
of
those
carriers
which
is
--
who
was
a
member
of
the
carriers
association
and
which
is
a
member
of
this
referral,
which
is
a
party
to
this
referral
agreement.
now,
this
referral
agreement
applies
only
to
casual
employees
employed
by
these
carriers
and
employed
by
seattle
motor
carriers,
not
the
regular
drivers,
just
the
casual
drivers
employed
by
these
companies.
and
the
referral
clause
which
is
set
forth
on
page
4
of
our
brief
and
page
62
of
the
record,
states
expressly
that
dispatching
through
the
union
in
a
hall
located
some
three
miles
from
a
union
headquarters
was
to
be
done
exclusively
on
a
basis
of
seniority
in
the
industry.
in
the
entire
industry
covered
by
the
contract,
seniority
became
applicable
after
three
months
of
employments
and
seniority
was
absolutely
determinative
regardless
of
whether
any
applicant
was
or
was
not
a
union
member,
that's
expressly
written
into
the
contract.
if
a
union
couldn't
supply
the
necessary
casual
help,
the
employer
was
free
to
hire
his
own
and
as
i
indicated,
the
employer
hired
all
his
own
regular
employees.
lester
slater,
the
individual
involved
in
this
case,
was
a
member
in
good
standing
of
the
petitioner
union
for
some
two
years
prior
to
august
of
1955.
and
during
that
two-year
period,
he
had
obtained
casual
employment
through
the
referral
system
set
up
in
the
contract.
in
that
--
at
that
time
in
august,
through
some
mistake
that's
not
relevant
here,
he
obtained
employment
with
seattle
motor
express
without
going
through
the
referral
system
under
the
contract.
when
the
union
learned
about
this
it
asked
the
employer
to
let
slater
go
unless
he
went
through
the
provisions
of
the
--
unless
he
followed
the
provisions
of
the
contract
and
the
employer
did
let
slater
go
at
the
union's
request.
thereafter,
slater
filed
charges
with
the
labor
board
and
the
board
issued
its
complaint
against
the
union
and
the
employer,
slater
--
los
angeles
seattle
motor
express
alleging
that
the
--
slater's
discharge
operated
to
violate
sections
8
(a)
(3),
8
(b)
(2)
as
well
as
8
(a)
(1)
and
8
(b)
1
(a)
under
the
referral
agreement.
the
trial
examiner
dismissed
the
complaint
in
its
entirety,
finding
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
discriminatory
application
of
the
agreement,
either
at
slater
or
generally,
and
finding
further
that
the
agreement
was
valid
on
its
face.
an
appeal
to
the
board,
the
full
board
reversed
in
a
very
short
opinion
in
which
the
issues
weren't
discussed,
but
the
board
did
rely
and
referred
to
its
recent
decision
in
mountain
--
in
the
mountain
pacific
case,
the
infamous
mountain
pacific
case,
in
which
for
the
first
time
the
board
had
held
that
the
union
hiring
hall
or
a
referral
system
or
agreement
was
invalid
or
operated
to
violate
the
law
on
its
face
and
would
be
held
violative
of
the
provisions
i
just
mentioned,
unless
a
clause
that
contained
express
provisions
prescribed
by
the
board
which
are
as
follows.
first,
the
agreement
has
to
expressly
disclaim
any
intent
to
discriminate
and
has
to
expressly
state
that
it
will
not
be
applied
discriminatorily
as
between
union
members
and
non-union
members.
second,
it
had
to
state
expressly
that
the
employer
was
free
to
reject
any
applicant
for
any
clause
at
the
employer's
sole
discretion.
and
third,
it
had
to
require
that
either
the
referral
agreement
with
these
clauses
in
it
be
posted
in
places
where
it
would
be
seen
and
read
by
applicants.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
will
tell
you
by
shortly.
the
union
does
object
to
--
particularly
to
the
clause
which
says
that
the
employer
has
a
completely
free
hand
to
reject
applicants.
we
feel
that
many
collective
agreements
state
that
the
union
at
least
should
have
say
on
that
and
it
maybe
a
matter
for
grievance
procedure
or
arbitration
if
the
union
thinks
that
the
rejection
is
arbitrary.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
irrespective
of
the
administration
generally
or
in
respect
to
a
particular
individuals
and
also,
the
employer
(inaudible)
the
same
unfair
labor
practices
that
are
applicable
as
in
employers,
the
8
(a)
sections.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no,
your
honor.
prior
to
that,
as
i
will
indicate
shortly,
the
board
had
upheld
these
agreements.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
none
--
none
whatsoever.
the
board
simply
says
that's
irrelevant
for
reasons
which
i
say
that
the
agreement
on
its
face
must
be
held
to
inherently
encourage
membership.
now,
as
--
as
i've
--
and
as
we've
just
been
discussing,
i
--
the
importance
by
the
important
here
to
note
that
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever,
none
--
none
in
slightest
that
slater
here
had
lost
his
job
because
of
his
union
membership
or
lack
of
it
or
--
or
because
of
his
activity
in
the
union
or
lack
of
activity
in
the
union.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
was
a
good
member
and
standing
at
--
a
member
in
good
standing
at
the
time
of
his
discharge.
the
board
so
held
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
would
have
been
a
contract
breach
had
any
applicant
been
referred
by
--
on
the
basis
of
his
union
membership
or
lack
of
that
and
on
a
criterion
other
than
his
seniority.
and
finally,
as
i
indicated
the
board
it
completely
immaterial
and
irrelevant
that
there
was
no
discrimination
as
to
slater
or
that
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
as
to
any
discriminatory
application
of
this
referral
agreement
during
its
term.
the
board
reasoned
that
under
--
in
mountain
pacific
and
it
applied
the
doctrine
here
that
any
agreement
under
which
a
union
had
exclusive
control
of
hiring
or
referral
will
inherently
operate
to
encourage
union
membership
of
the
employees
or
the
applicants
being
put
in
position
where
they
feel
that
they
must
either
cater
to
the
union
or
become
a
union
member
in
order
to
get
referred
and
the
board
concluded
by
saying
that
the
inference
of
encouragements
of
union
membership
is
inescapable
for
the
mere
existence
of
a
union
--
union
referral
agreement.
and
this,
even
though
the
referral
agreement
itself
has
no
discriminatory
clauses
in
it
such
as
that
only
union
members
will
be
referred
or
that
union
members
exclusively
have
access
to
the
agreement.
the
union
appealed
to
the
courts
of
appeals
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
in
our
brief
and
argument
there
and
our
--
in
our
first
brief
here.
i'm
mentioning
this
because
the
board
has
somewhat
changed
its
position
in
its
reply
to
our
brief
but
in
our
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals
below
and
in
our
first
brief
here,
we
argued
simply
that
the
--
the
board
in
so
inferring
an
unlawful
act
was
basing
its
--
but
it
was
concluding
on
a
basis
of
mere
inference
and
speculation
that
it
was
attempting
to
shift
the
burden
of
proof
that
it
was
--
or
there
was
this
duty
and
function
to
specifically
prove
by
some
credible
evidence
that
there
was
a
discriminatory
application
either
as
slater
or
generally
and
that
the
board
was
avoiding
this
burden.
two
of
the
judges
below,
justices
miller
and
danaher
affirmed
the
board
in
a
per
curiam
without
discussion.
judge
edgerton
dissented
following
with
the
arguments
that
we
had
made
in
the
brief
and
at
oral
argument.
all
judges
however
disagreed
with
the
board
as
to
the
remedy
which
had
been
adopted
all
holding
that
the
board
had
exceeded
its
powers
in
--
in
requiring
return
of
the
dues
and
--
and
initiation.
now,
the
board
here
in
its
reply
brief
has
taken
a
somewhat
different
position
to
what
it
–
it
took
below
and
from
what
the
board
itself
took
in
the
mountain
pacific
case.
the
board
now
argues
that
section
8
(a)
(3)
can
be
broken
down
into
two
parts.
the
first
part
which
deals
with
the
discrimination
in
regard
to
hire,
the
word
discrimination
in
that
part
of
8
(b)
(8)
and
8
(b)
(3),
8
(a)
(3)
can
be
equated
with
the
term
difference
or
disparity
so
that
if
any
difference
or
disparity
has
been
brought
about
in
hire,
the
first
part
of
section
8
(a)
(3)
is
applicable
and
then
the
board
says
that
one
fact
difference
is
established
even
though
it
has
no
relation
to
union
member
--
membership
as
such,
the
board
then
has
a
body
of
experts
isn't
--
is
permitted
or
is
to
be
permitted
to
look
into
the
practical,
practicalities
of
the
situation
and
see
whether
the
difference
that
had
been
created
does
operate
in
its
judgment
as
experts
to
encourage
or
discourage
union
membership.
the
difference
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
in
the
government's
brief.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
brief.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no,
in
their
brief
which
was
in
reply
to
our
principal
brief,
we
filed
the
first
brief
and
the
government
filed
its
brief.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
the
government's
brief.
now,
the
difference
or
disparity
or
discrimination
here,
says
the
board,
is
the
--
and
as
created
by
this
hiring
arrangement
as
by
any
hiring
arrangement
is
found
to
exist
in
the
creation
of
two
classes
of
jobseekers,
those
who
must
apply
through
the
union
and
those
who
must
not.
by
having
found
this
alleged
discrimination,
the
board
calls,
it's
a
discrimination,
the
board
then
with
its
special
knowledge
in
the
field
concludes
that
these
systems
inevitably
operate
to
encourage
jobseekers
either
to
become
members
or
ingratiate
themselves
with
the
union
so
that
the
board
can
reasonably
conclude
union
encouragement
and
the
board
need
not
demonstrate
further
that
there
was
any
actual
discrimination
because
of
union
membership
or
any
actual
encouragement
of
union
membership
other
than
the
mere
existence
of
the
union
of
referral
agreement
and
the
need
for
employees
or
applicants
to
go
through
that
agreement
to
obtain
their
employment.
this
--
this
reasoning,
we
believe
to
be
utterly
places,
a
foul
that
would
commit
the
board
to
inquire
into
and
imperil
the
whole
fabric
of
collective
bargaining.
all
collective
bargaining
agreements
as
i
will
indicate
shortly
do
create
similar
differences.
the
term
"discrimination"
as
used
in
section
8
(a)
(3)
we
say
must
necessarily
have
some
reference
or
relationship
to
union
membership
or
to
union
membership
as
such
or
some
aspect
of
it
and
that
the
mere
creation
of
two
classes
is
not
sufficient,
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
union
membership
is
not
--
is
not
enough.
now,
before
discussing
this
reasoning
and
our
disagreement
with
it,
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
in
all
the
years
that
this
issue
has
been
before
the
board
in
previous
cases,
and
there
have
been
some
seven-and-a-half
years
the
board
has
had
various
aspects
of
the
hiring
hall
before
it,
all
previous
boards
have,
without
any
difficultly,
found
the
hiring
agreements
valid
on
its
face
and
not
violative
of
the
act
on
its
face.
and
in
each
case,
the
board
would
find
a
violation
of
the
act
only
if
it
was
shown
there
was
some
actual
discrimination
regard
to
union
membership
practiced
under
the
agreement
or
as
applied
to
particular
individuals.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
we
have
--
we
have
references
in
our
brief
to
the
practices
in
the
different
industry.
i
don't
think
we
have
in
our
brief
though
actual
statistics
as
to
the
how
many
hiring
halls
are
in
existence
in
each
of
these
industries
but
the
fact
is
and
economic
writers
all
indicate
that
the
practice
is
quite
extensive
in
the
maritime
and
stevedoring
and
in
building
trade,
less
in
transportation
which
we're
involved
with
here,
except
in
the
casual
part
of
transportation,
(inaudible)
transportation
which
we
have
in
this
case
where
there
are
--
a
similar
agreements.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
it
does
in
the
building
trades
field,
it's
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
only
the
building
trades
field
so
landrum-griffin
amendments
don't
affect
this
case
except
in
the
building
trades
field.
similarly,
the
courts,
all
the
courts
that
have
considered
the
question
prior
to
the
board's
decision
in
mountain
pacific,
all
the
courts,
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
that
have
considered
the
question
of
--
of
each
of
them
upheld
the
hiring
hall
as
such
as
long
that
it
didn't
contain
in
it
an
--
a
discriminatory
clause
or
as
long
as
there
was
no
discrimination
in
practice
under
it
or
a
discriminatory
application
under
the
agreement.
this
is
the
first
case,
mountain
pacific
was
the
first
case
and
it's
the
first
case
in
which
it
was
--
was
applied
to
the
(inaudible)
remedy
in
which
it
has
been
held
invalid
on
its
face.
the
circuit
courts
have
splits
and
to
whether
the
board's
mountain
pacific
doctrine
is
proper
under
the
act
and
that's
why
the
case
is
here.
two
circuits
have
held
with
--
with
the
board
and
two
and
perhaps
three
have
held
against
the
board,
usually
in
spilt
decisions.
further,
the
legislative
history
of
the
1947
amendment
indicates
quite
clearly
that
there
was
no
intent
by
congress
to
outlaw
the
hiring
hall
at
such
--
as
such
but
only
discriminatory
practices
under
it.

one
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
pardon?
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
the
board's
view
would
outlaw
the
union
referral
agreement
unless
it
contained
these
three
proscriptions.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
it
would
outlaw
the
agreement
in
this
case
because
it
does
not
have
these
three
conditions.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
that
is
right
your
honor
but
i
will
tell
why
it
doesn't
satisfy
the
union
shortly.
so
as
far
as
legislative
history
is
concerned,
it's
quite
clear
and
i
don't
think
the
board
argues
to
the
contrary
that
congress
intended
to
outlaw
the
hiring
hall
as
such
which
--
which
on
its
face
was
not
discriminatory
or
which
is
not
discriminatory
in
application,
just
quite
clear.
now,
turning
to
the
board's
rationale
which
would
mechanically
apply
to
section
8
(a)
(3)
and
--
and
use
the
board's
alleged
expertise
to
infer
or
preclude
that
the
inevitable
result
of
hiring
halls
was
to
encourage
union
membership.
we
say,
first
of
all
that
the
board
has
failed
adequately
to
define
a
relevant
class.
the
relevant
class
in
this
case
and
in
other
hiring
hall
cases
is
not
those
who
must
go
through
the
union
form
plummet
or
not
at
all
anymore
than
it
would
be,
all
that
have
to
go
through
an
employer
or
not
at
all.
the
relevant
class,
the
only
irrelevant
class
which
the
board
should
consider
is
the
class
the
employees
or
all
employees
or
applicants
who
seek
casual
employment,
all
applicants
who
seek
casual
employment.
now,
as
to
this
class,
it's
quite
clear
that
there
is
no
discrimination
all
in
that
class,
all
seeking
causal
employment
are
dealt
with
evenhandedly
on
an
equal
basis.
all
are
referred
for
employment
regardless
of
membership
or
non-membership
and
solely
on
the
basis
of
seniority.
what
the
board
is
really
saying
is
--
here
as
in
their
attempted
classification
is
that
to
enforce
a
uniform
standard
applicable
to
an
entire
class
is
to
discriminate
against
those
who
disregard
it.
it's
like
saying
that
people
who
try
to
get
into
a
restaurant
before
or
after
closing
hours
and
are
excluded
because
the
restaurant
has
a
rule
that
you
can't
get
in
or
out
the
restaurant
before
or
after
closing
hours
are
discriminated
against
as
distinguished
from
a
--
a
discrimination
which
might
result
from
their
race,
religion
or
union
affiliation,
the
same
sort
of
analogy,
the
board
is
--
is
--
in
dealing
with
here.
now,
we
say
this,
if
the
creation
of
a
class
of
those
who
have
to
go
through
the
union
for
employment
constitutes
discrimination
that
that
really
can
constitute
discrimination
that
their
creation
of
that
class
of
those
who
have
to
go
through
the
union
for
employment
then
under
all
collective
agreements,
many
similar
classes
of
alleged
discriminations
are
created.
the
most
obvious
example
of
course
is
the
fact
that
the
union
under
--
under
a
type
of
bargaining
agreement
is
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
and
employees
have
to
look
to
the
union
to
protect
their
rights
under
a
collective
bargaining
or
not
at
all.
so
therefore,
they
--
the
board
could
reasonably
infer
i
suppose
that
the
--
that
union
membership
is
encouraged.
and
even
more
striking
usual
clause
is
the
grievance
clause
in
most
union
contracts
under
which
the
union
handles
grievances
exclusively.
there
again,
this
creates
a
class
that
go
through
that
--
go
through
the
union
and
those
who
do
not
and
it
could
reasonably
be
said
by
the
board
that
the
employees
are
subtly
–
subtly
encouraged
to
be
friendly
with
the
union
or
to
join
the
union
or
to
ingratiate
themselves
with
the
union
just
as
they
do
because
of
the
existence
of
the
hiring
hall
and
there
are
more
--
even
more
barring
examples.
the
one
before
this
court,
in
aeronautical
industrial
lodge
versus
campbell,
337
u.s.
2
–
521,
there
the
collective
agreement
provided
that
union
stewards
be
accorded
seniority
--
super
seniority
even
beyond
war
veterans
solely
on
the
basis
of
their
being
union
stewards.
this
court
upheld
that
alleged
discrimination
in
that
case
although
the
nl
--
the
national
labor
relations
act
was
not
directly
involved
there.
however,
later,
when
this
court
did
consider
a
similar
type
of
seniority
clause
in
ford
motor
company
versus
hoffman,
it
reverted
back
to
the
industrial
lodge
case
and
held
--
and
then
indicated
by
way
of
dictum
at
least
that
the
seniority
clause
in
aeronautical
lodge
versus
campbell
would
not
violate
the
national
labor
relations
act.
we
submit
that's
most
obviously,
if
that
clause
would
not
violate
the
act
then
certainly,
the
mere
existence
of
a
referral
agreement
would
not
violate
--
violate
the
act
because
of
a
tendency
or
some
sort
of
an
--
tendency
to
encourage
union
membership.
what
the
board
forgets
is
that
the
union
--
all
unions
are
service
institutions
and
the
more
and
the
better
they
service,
the
more
they
are
likely
to
encourage
membership.
so,
all
of
union
functioning
could
be
drawn
into
possible
violation
of
the
act
by
virtue
of
some
inherent
tendency
to
encourage
membership.
i
don't
think
the
board
is
going
to
argue
that
but
it's
the
--
it
follows
from
what
they
are
trying
to
assert
here
in
hall
and
–the
hiring
hall
inherently
unlawful.
similarly,
employers
have
many
occasions
to
affect
employment
rights
in
their
discharges,
layoffs,
promotions
and
demotions
where
a
discrimination
i
suppose
is
created
but
where
of
course
the
board
is
required
to
show
that
there
was
an
actual
intent
to
discriminate
because
of
union
membership
or
a
lack
of
it
by
reason
of
the
demotion
or
layoff.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
we
believe
not
for
these
reasons,
your
honor.
in
the
first
place,
the
--
the
hiring
hall
agreement
of
clause
is
a
subject
matter,
a
very
important
subject
matter
of
collective
bargaining.
in
these
industries
in
particular,
it
is
probably
one
of
the
most
important
portions
of
the
collective
agreement.
we
feel
the
party
should
be
free
to
negotiate
their
own
clauses
without
interference
from
the
board
particularly
where
as
i
will
indicated
shortly
that
there's
--
if
these
causes
are
not
in
themselves
and
cannot
in
themselves
be
called
illegal.
we
--
we
resent
suggestions
from
the
board,
let
alone
mandates
from
the
board,
as
to
what
should
be
put
in
to
collective
agreements
before
we
can
use
them,
before
we
can
agree
to
particular
clauses.
and
we
say
that
if
these
clauses
are
valid
without
these
conditions
that
the
board
seeks
to
impose,
there
is
no
reason
in
law
or
in
policy
why
we
shouldn't
be
permitted
to
make
our
own
agreement
the
employer
and
the
union
and
enforce
them
according
to
their
terms.
now,
in
addition
as
i
will
show
shortly,
the
--
the
particular
clauses
are
--
the
particular
conditions
which
the
board
seeks
to
impose
upon
us
are
objectionable,
in
particular
the
one
which
says
that
we
have
--
we
have
no
right
to
have
any
voice
in
rejections
of
applicants.
but
apart
from
that,
i
think
it's
very
important
that
--
but
we
think
it
important
that
we
be
permitted
to
--
to
maintain
the
rights
and
negotiate
our
own
contracts
if
they're
legal,
free
from
board
interference.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
just
before
the
recess,
we
were
discussing
the
reasons
why
the
unions
object
to
the
boards
attempting
to
condition
their
union
rapport.
i
think
--
i
don't
think
i
have
pointed
out
in
this
case
as
yet,
however
that
here,
the
board
assumes
in
illegal
agreement
of
some
sort
before
it
even
attempts
to
impose
a
condition,
it
attempts
to
impose
a
condition
only
as
a
means
of
achieving
--
of
eliminating
what
it
thinks
is
illegal
about
the
agreement.
so
under
the
board's
own
rationale
if
as
i've
indicated,
the
agreement
is
--
and
must
be
considered
legal
on
its
face
because
not
discriminatory
on
its
face
or
an
implication,
then
the
board's
right
even
to
impose
conditions
is
lost.
now,
obviously,
if
the
agreement
were
legal
without
these
conditions,
the
board
would
have
no
right
to
impose
these
three
conditions
because
it
would
be
a
direct
intrusion
on
the
collective
bargaining
process
which
this
court
in
the
oliver
case
and
in
american
national
insurance
and
the
many
other
cases
that
says,
"it's
not
the
board's
function."
it
is
commerce's
function
to
impose
conditions
like
that
if
it
thinks
the
hiring
hall
in
some
way
should
be
tampered
with
or
if
it
thinks
the
unions
and
the
employers
should
not
have
a
right
to
make
their
own
agreements.
that's
for
congress
to
--
to
do,
not
for
this
board.
and
so,
on
any
other
postulate
but
--
that
the
agreement
itself
on
its
face
is
illegal,
the
board
would
have
no
power
to
impose
these
conditions,
i
think
that's
clear.
now,
turning
to
the
specific
conditions
once
more
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
just
by
an
edict
to
mountain
pacific,
we
--
we
hereby
state
that
you
can't
have
a
union
referral
agreement
which
we
find
on
its
face
to
be
illegal
which
--
which
in
all
such
agreements,
we
--
we
conclude
are
illegal
because
they
encourage
membership
unless,
you
put
in
one,
two,
three.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
none
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
none,
your
honor
the
board
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
no
promulgates
the
rules
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
--
no
provision
of
the
law,
no
legislative
history,
merely
something
which
the
board
in
its
expertise
deemed
--
this
board
at
least
deemed
was
necessary
in
order
to
have
a
proper
union
referral
agreement
under
the
taft-hartley
act.
all
previous
force
just
as
expertise
did
not
have
this
dealing
but
this
court
has
imposed
these
three
conditions.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
there
was
when
--
when
senator
murdock
was
on
the
board,
he
dissented
the
mountain
pacific.
the
present
board,
there
is
no
--
no
dissent.
now,
on
the
three
conditions,
the
unions
object
very
strongly
to
being
required
to
expressly
include
the
provisions
which
says
that
they
aren't
going
to
discriminate
because
that
adds
a
--
a
contractual
obligation
not
to
discriminate,
in
addition
to
the
statutory
obligation
not
to
discriminate.
thus
giving
--
thus,
if
there
is
a
violation
giving
two
remedies,
thus
the
remedy
of
a
contract
violation
being
available
in
whatever
form
someone
might
be
able
get
into.
and
if
there
is
any
discriminate,
we'd
rather
have
the
board
and
look
rather
than
some
course.
we
think
this
is
a
matter
primarily
to
the
board
to
worry
about
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
there's
dozens
of
them.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
mount
pacific
is
the
only
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
--
is
the
only
case
where
the
rationale
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
--
will
be
discussed.
i
think
that's
a
correct
statement.
mount
pacific
is
the
only
case
where
they
really
discuss
the
rationale.
that's
set
forth
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
of
the
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
1950
--
1958,
march,
1958.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
march,
1958,
i
think
1958
or
april
1,
1958.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
april
1,
1958.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
that's
their
rationale.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
that
same
rationale
as
i
said
implies
to
all
collective
bargaining
agreements
where
the
union
is
the
--
is
the
exclusive
representative
and
pretty
much
ingratiate
themselves
to
use
the
board's
phrase
or
where
the
union
has
to
do
with
the
grievance
settlement
or
where
--
where
if
you're
a
union
steward,
you
can
get
super
seniority.
all
sorts
of
conditions
in
collective
agreements
might
give
unions
--
might
bend
the
employees
under
the
agreement
to
get
in
good
with
the
union
but
that
doesn't
--
is
not
enough.
there
has
to
be
an
encouragement
or
a
discrimination
based
on
union
membership
which
we
haven't
got
here
anywhere.
the
board
merely
assumes
--
infers
that
there
--
that
there
is
some
inherent
encouragement
in
--
in
hiring
halls.
congress
didn't
find
so,
congress
didn't
think
it's
necessary
to
legislate
on
it.
all
previous
boards
didn't
think
so.
this
particular
board
has
relied
on
some
or
mostly
about
12
cases
in
which
this
had
the
hiring
hall
actually
before
it
and
from
that
assumes
this.
we
have
--
if
--
if
that
assumption
is
to
be
made
in
the
case
of
the
union
where
the
employment
is
channeled
through
the
union
then
the
board
should
make
the
same
assumptions
when
the
employment
is
channeled
to
the
employer
because
employers,
the
--
the
statistics
show
are
10
times
discriminatory
as
unions
when
they
have
a
chance
to
reject
or
not
reject
on
their
own.
so
by
the
board's
same
reasoning,
these
standards
and
--
and
these
three
conditions
should
be
a
test
to
the
employer's
right
to
hire
on
his
own
when
he
is
the
exclusive
source
of
employment,
the
employer
because
the
record
show,
experience
shows
that
employers
are
much
more
discriminatory
than
unions.
so,
the
whole
--
that
that
i
grab
will
be
ridiculous
but
that
is
the
board's
reasoning
in
this
case.
and
that
--
that
that's
why
we
say,
you
have
to
show
some
actual
intent
as
in
the
case
of
slater
here
get
after
slater
because
he
didn't
abide
by
some
union
rule
before
he
could
be
discharged.
in
this
case,
slater
was
discharged
not
because
he
was
a
good,
bad
or
in
different
union
member
at
all.
he
was
discharged
solely
because
he
didn't
do
what
all
other
employees
in
industry
or
other
casual
employees
in
the
industry
do
go
through
the
contractual
provisions
for
employment.
and
accordingly,
all
he
was
discharged
for
was
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
proper
collective
agreement
before
the
board
to
--
to
seek
to
reinstate
in
a
given
back
pay
as
to
afford
the
protections
of
the
act
to
deliberate
contract
breaker.
that's
all
slater
was.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
he
was
been
referred.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
he
would
have
an
absolute
right
to
be
referred
on
the
basis
of
his
union
seniority
for
two
years
prior
to
when
he
was
fired,
he
was
--
he
had
gone
through
the
hall
and
had
been
referred
on
each
and
every
occasion
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
--
based
on
his
seniority
and
he
was
a
member
of
good
standing.
so,
how
could
there
be
any
union
encouragement?
there's
no
point
and
he
was
a
member
in
good
standing
of
the
union
when
he
was
discharged
at
the
request
of
the
union
for
not
going
through
the
procedures
set
forth
in
the
contract
not
because
he
was
not
a
good
union
member
or
bad
union
member
or
he
was
in
bad
with
the
union,
not
bad
at
all
simply
as
refusal
to
go
through
the
hiring
procedure
which
been
set
--
had
been
set
up
by
the
employer
and
the
unions
in
the
whole
southern
california
area,
many
thousands
of
employees
involved
to
regularize
and
channelize
employment.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
yes,
it's
not
material
here
but
there
was
--
he
went
under
the
mistaken
belief
and
didn't
have
to
at
one
point.
he's
had
a
letter
from
someone
not
authorize
to
give
a
letter
saying
he
could
get
the
job
without
going
through
it,
this
particular
job.
and
it
was
a
--
there
was
--
letters
shouldn't
have
been
given,
it
was
given
by
an
unauthorized
representative.
the
board
doesn't
claim
that
that
amount
to
referral,
proper
referral,
so
the
situation
is
--
is
exactly
as
if
he
never
went
through
the
hiring
procedure
at
all
which
he
didn't.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
then
he
--
well,
i
don't
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
the
record
doesn't
show
whether
there
was
any
disciplinary
action
taken
by
the
union
against
him.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that
is
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
he
was
discharged
at
the
union's
request
because
he
had
failed
to
comply
with
the
contract
referral.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
the
board
found
that
to
be
violation
of
8
(a)
(3)
by
the
employer
and
8
(b)
(1)
or
8
(b)
(2)
by
the
union.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
well,
if
he
went
through
the
hiring
procedure,
he
was
free
to
get
another
job.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
automatically.
he
chose
to
go
to
the
labor
board
and
file
charges.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
not
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
not
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
don't
think
the
record
showed
either
way
but
i
--
i
know,
it
wouldn't
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
you
--
it
makes
no
difference
at
all
whether
you're
union
member
or
a
non-union
member
or
a
union
officer
or
non-union
officer
or
anything
to
do
with
the
union.
if
you
have
seniority
in
the
industry
and
as
the
whole
southern
california
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
you'd
have
to
go
through
the
union,
show
your
seniority,
they
keep
records
as
to
your
work
with
the
different
employers,
to
see
it's
an
intermittent
scattered
thing
for
--
one
day
at
a
time.here,
there
with
a
thousand
different
employers.
they
keep
records
and
that's
maintained
in
the
central
hall,
the
union
--
the
union
referral
hall
and
then
they
look
at
the
record
to
see,
"well,
what's
your
seniority
in
the
industry?"
and
then
you're
referred
on
the
basis
of
that
seniority,
you
got
the
most
seniority,
you're
the
first
outs.
the
board
disclaims
any
intent
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
union
membership
as
such
here
at
all.
that
isn't
in
this
record.
board
thinks
it's
immaterial.
the
board
simply
said
that
the
mere
fact
that
you
have
to
go
the
union
at
all
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
--
makes
to
the
thing
illegal.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
they
concede
that
it's
immaterial.
they
say
that's
irrelevant.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i'll
reserve
the
remaining
time
--

on

on

of
the

of
the

the

mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
thank
you.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
if
--
if
they
did
so
your
honor,
it
was
under
threat
of
having
to
return
all
dues
in
the
--
initiations
fees
collected
during
the
period
of
the
unlawful
referral,
so
i
don't
think
that
denotes
its
union
acceptance
for
the
board's
proposition
at
all.
i
think
the
more
one
listens
to
the
board's
argument
here,
the
more
obvious
it
becomes
that
the
board
is
trying
to
do
congress'
job.
i'll
just
read
two
excerpts
from
legislative
history.
here
is
senator
taft's
in
answer
to
the
thomas
bill
of
1959
on
page
23
of
our
brief.
he
states,
“in
order
to
make
clear
the
real
intention
of
congress,
it
should
be
clearly
stated
that
the
hiring
hall
is
not
necessarily
illegal.
the
employer
should
be
able
to
make
a
contract
with
union
as
an
employment
agency.
neither
the
law
nor
the
decisions
forbid
hiring
halls,
even
hiring
halls
operated
by
--
operated
by
unions
so
long
as
they
are
not
so
operated
as
to
create
a
closed
shop.”
then
in
1959
was
the
landrum-griffin,
this
is
on
page
4
of
the
brief
for
petitioners
in
the
following
case,
number
68,
and
commenting
upon
the
hiring
hall
provisions
of
the
landrum-griffin
section,
8
(f)
ongoing
construction.
this
is
both
the
senate
and
the
house
reports.
“these
provisions
are
not
intended
to
diminish
the
right
of
labor
organizations
and
employers
to
establish
an
exclusive
referral
system
of
the
type
permitted
under
existing
law.”
this
court,
i'm
afraid
will
have
to
determine
what
is
existing
law.
at
that
time,
the
law
was
that
they
were
legal
under
mountain
--
under
all
decisions
prior
to
mountain
pacific.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
none.
on
the
contrary,
all
courts
affirmed
the
validity
and
required
the
board
to
make
a
positive
proof
of
discrimination.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
i
think
it's
--
in
what
your
honor
have
mentioned
a
minute
ago,
they
changed
in
personnel.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
there
wasn't
any
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
--
nothing
in
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
the
examiner
had
decided
along
the
line
of
the
--
well,
the
board
decided
that
the
--
the
charges
were
in
the
line
of
the
board's
new
theory.
the
trial
examiner
rejected
the
board's
--
the
--
the
general
counsel's
theory
and
decided
in
--
in
line
of
the
previous
decisions,
all
which
upheld
--
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
this
was
a
general
counsel
proposal.
mr.
herbert
s.
thatcher
that's
--
or
must
have
originated
there
under
the
charges
in
mountain
pacific
specifically.
thank
you.
