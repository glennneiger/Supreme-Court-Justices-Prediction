questions

explained
it.
justice

suppose
he
had
come
to
the
hiring
hall
of
the
union,
what
would
have
been
his
--
justice

black
--
what
have
been
his
rights?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
his
status
after
the
union
took
the
matter
after
his
employer
and
he
was
denied
the
place?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
his
status
with
reference
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
that
he
was
--
that
he
was
discharged?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
what's
found
to
be
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
after
he
was
discharged,
what
was
his
status
with
reference
to
future
employment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
automatically?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
admit
the
statute
defer
on
that?
i
asked
you
the
question
as
to
what
was
the
man
has
stated
after
the
action
authority
is
taken
(inaudible)
what
precisely
had
been
thorn
and
he
--
and
he
gone
there
for
referral
and
he
would've
been
referred
for
seniority?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
that
--
as
i
gather
it,
filing
--
no
filing
or
it
means
no
more
than
this
from
what
you
say.
i'm
--
i
was
wrong
that
he
didn't
want
to
go
there
to
be
referred,
he
didn't
go.
he
went
to
the
employer
and
they
discharged
him,
then
he
wanted
to
still
continue
to
want
to
go
get
a
job
without
referral.
he
got
a
--
tried
to
get
a
national
officer
to
get
him
there.
but
do
you
have
any
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
basis
is
as
i
understand
it,
it's
inherently
by
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
board
has
found,
it's
so
inherently
susceptible
of
abusive
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
by
the
union
that
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
them
to
put
that
on
the
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
could
you
guarantee
that
with
the
second
provision
of
the
board's
holding
unless,
you
assume
that
the
employer
never
wants
to
encourage
him
either
to
belong
or
not
to
belong
to
a
union?
as
i
understand
it,
the
board
is
here
because
i
thought
you
said
that
whether
this
contract
bears
three
reasons.
one
of
which
is
that
even
though
a
union
selects
the
man
on
the
basis
of
seniority,
in
fact
sent
to
the
employer,
the
employer
must
be
left
with
the
right
to
reject
him
contrary
to
the
contract
he
made.
i
don't
understand
the
--
the
reason
for
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
in
connection
with
the
arguments
you're
making
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
either
to
the
employer
or
the
employee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
could
be
in
a
different
with
these
conditions
entirely?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
don't
put
that
in,
wouldn't
it
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
them
to
operate
their
hall
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
should
we
ask
to
discriminate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn't
it
be
an
unlawful
--
wouldn't
be
an
unfair
labor
act
from
--
to
discriminate
against
the
non-union
man
even
if
this
is
not
in
the
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
it
--
i
thought
it
would
have,
i'm
--
i'm
just
asking
when
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
forget
the
conditions
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it's
not
in
the
contract
but
they
do
discriminate
and
decline
to
let
a
union
man
go
--
non-union
man
do
that
who
has
seniority,
wouldn't
that
be
of
unfair
labor
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
--
what
this
is
doing
in
effect
one,
is
simply
to
get
them
to
say
they
won't
violate
the
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
the
union
man
think
he's
going
to
get
better
treatment
merely
because
you
left
the
employer
with
the
right
to
refuse
him
even
though
he
had
seniority?
how
could
he
anticipate
that
the
employee
was
treated
better
because
he
was
a
union
man?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
if
the
employer
has
taken
away
from
him
the
right
to
follow
a
procedure
where
he
selects
the
man
who
has
seniority,
that's
what
it
is,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
in
the
--
that's
--
that's
an
argument
against
employer
and
employee
having
the
right
to
make
an
agreement.
they
will
apply
according
to
seniority,
they're
two
separate
things.
one
is
that
and
the
other
is
where
the
union
should
be
allowed
to
administer
to
the
extent
that
it's
allowed
under
the
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
even
there
are
safeguards,
they
discriminate.
can't
the
board
hold
them
guilty
with
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
can
understand
your
argument
or
the
board's
argument
that
hiring
halls
are
inherently
beneficial
to
unions
and
that
means
on
the
question,
"what
congress
done
about
it,
has
it
said
anything
or
declined
to
say
anything
or
taken
any
action
or
refuse
to
take
any
action?"
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
effort
made
to
outlaw?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
effort
made
to
make
it
legal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
specific
terms.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
anybody
ever
have
an
amendment
in
connection
with
it
or
did
anybody
ever
have
anything
for
senate
in
connection
with
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
he
do
that
in
connection
with
an
amendment
where
he
was
going
to
live
the
employer
with
that
right
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
hiring
hall?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that
on
--
on
your
brief?
do
you
remember?
i
don't
--
take
your
time
if
you
take
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
your
answer,
it
would
be
means
that
--
that
does
not
what
it
means
as
i
like
to
know.
it
means
that
this
contract
was
interpret
to
them
even
as
it
is
without
these
conditions
if
the
employer
had
left
him
set
free
to
accept
or
not
to
accept
the
board's
assignment
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
the
--
would
the
unfair
labor
practice
are
discriminating
without
this
clause
if
at
you
say,
would
be
any
greater
and
would
if
it's
in
or
any
greater
unfair
labor
practice
if
this
is
in
that
what
if
he's
out,
if
the
act
to
discriminate
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
it
correct
to
say
that
the
whole
argument
that
boils
down
to
this
if
this
is
a
bad
practice
which
inherently
bad,
it
ought
not
to
be
allowed,
can't
the
--
congress
has
not
barred
by
itself
by
anything
specific,
did
not
acted
on
it
at
all
as
to
board
now
has
acted
itself
and
it
is
question
is
whether
the
board
has
the
power
to
do
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
that
the
one
that
you
never
found
again
until
1958?
did
you
--
did
you
question
that
and
the
board
changed
any
during
those
days?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
your
man
didn't
gain
much
experience,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
your
man
didn't
gain
much
experience
from
what
the
others
have
gained?[laughter]
justice
hugo
l.
black
let
me
ask
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
all
the
experience
of
the
board
up
to
this
time
had
been
the
other
way,
i
understood
you
to
say
and
they
hadn't
--
hadn't
thought
it
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
all
the
members
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
up
to
the
time
of
the
mountain
pacific
case,
had
there
been
anything
court
that
it
indicated
that
this
kind
of
contract
would
be
illegal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
this
method
of
determination
--
how
was
it
suggested
first
to
the
board,
does
the
record
show?
was
it
in
the
brief
or
what
was
it
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
was
--
it
must
have
been
something
that
preceded
the
board's
finding
in
the
way
of
an
argument,
was
it
not?
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
had
the
examiner
decide
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
this
proposed
in
by
the
general
counsel?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
why
it
originated?
