was
there
any
challenge
to
the
finding
of
the
examiner
to
the
effect
that
there
had
been
no
actual
discrimination
in
this
operation
of
this

chief

earl

mr.
thatcher,
is
there
--
are
there
any
statistics
to
show
how
extensive
the
hiring-hall
practice
is
in
the
country?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
date
of
that
--
what
was
the
date
of
that
opinion?

his

would
have

on
his

right
to
go
through

the
regular
way
--
chief

--
and
(voice

according
to
similarly?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
come.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
mr.
thatcher
to
say
that
--
that
there
was
an
express
finding
by
the
examiner
that
--
that
there
was
no
discrimination
in
this
situation
and
that
that
was
not
challenged.
chief
justice

how
about
a
union
shop?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
--
i
was
just
thinking
about
the
policy
of
--
of
the
union
shop
as
compares
with
the
policy
of
this
kind
of
a
--
of
a
hiring
hall,
wouldn't
it
be
far
more
encouragement
to
join
the
union,
to
have
a
union
shop
agreement
than
to
have
an
agreement
of
this
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there's
a
different
alright
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
wouldn't
you
say
that
that
as
the
approach
that
30
days
as
a
non-union
member
with
the
thought
that
he
was
about
to
lose
his
job
permanently
at
the
end
of
the
30
days
unless
he
joined
the
union
that
there
would
be
some
encouragement
offered
by
such
an
agreement
to
--
to
join
the
union?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
did
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
does
that
leave
us,
mr.
come?
was
this
--
was
this
kind
of
an
arrangement
for
a
hiring
hall
legal
and
within
the
scope
of
collective
bargaining
prior
to
the
mountain
pacific
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is,
is
this
--
is
this
a
rule
that
the
--
that
the
board
lays
down
for
us
or
is
this
an
interpretation
that
all
previous
boards
who
are
wrong
and
that
it
always
has
been
illegal
to
have
such
--
such
kind
of
arrangements
even
though
they've
been
recognized
and
used
for
many
years
in
the
industry,
which
of
the
two
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
is
it
--
how
is
that
doctrine
being
administered
mr.
come?
is
--
are
they
all
automatically
banned
now
and
proscribed
by
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
do
you
wait
for
discrimination
in
some
case
--
in
cases
to
take
it
up?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
no
way
the
board,
you
know
where
--
where
things
of
this
kind
or
inherently
illegal,
there's
no
way
that
the
board
can
--
can
get
into
the
case?

justice
