what
--
i've
been
reading
this
board
opinion
in
that
case.
they
apparently
go
on
the
theory
that
they
need
the
--
these
protective
provisions
because
they
say
as
respects
the
non-union
members
that
may
be
hired,
they
will
be
--
instead
their
concern
is
and
must
be,
"what
about
themselves?"
will
probably
please
the
union
or
their
agents.
how
can
they
conduct
themselves
best
to
conform
with
such
rules
and
policies
as
unions
are
likely
to
enforce?
in
short,
how
to
ingratiate
themselves
with
the
union
regardless
of
what
the
employer's
desires
and
needs
maybe?
that
was
their
(voice
overlap)
--
justice

but
what
do
you
say
to
that?

justice
william

douglas
suppose,
i
was
a
non-union
member,
a
non-union
employee,
i'm
not
a
member
of
the
union,
how
would
i
work
--
how
does
it
work
in
the
hiring
hall
as
respects
me?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
i
--
i
have
to
go
through
the
union?
justice
william
o.
douglas
where
is
the
provision
in
the
contract
on
promising
no
discrimination?
i
don't
see
that
in
those
--
in
those
terms.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
think
by
three.
justice
william
o.
douglas
thank
you.
