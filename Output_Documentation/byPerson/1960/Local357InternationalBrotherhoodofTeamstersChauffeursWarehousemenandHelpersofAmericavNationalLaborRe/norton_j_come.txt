mr.
norton
j.
come
may
it
please
the
court.
as
mr.
--
mr.
thatcher
has
indicated,
this
case
involves
the
validity
of
the
board's
so
called
mountain
pacific
doctrine
which
has
been
approved
by
the
court
below
and
by
the
first
circuit
and
rejected
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
to
some
extent
by
the
--
by
the
sixth
circuit.
now,
in
the
mountain
pacific
case
which
was
the
basis
for
the
decision
here,
the
board
--
there's
a
combination
of
its
more
than
10
years
experience
with
union
control
hiring
hall
arrangements.
concluded
that
an
arrangement
between
an
employer
and
a
union
which
gives
the
union
exclusive
power
to
clear
applicants
for
an
employment,
in
short,
an
exclusive
hiring
hall
arrangement.
in
conditions
the
employment
upon
such
clearance,
violates
the
provisions
of
the
act,
sections
8
(a)
(3)
and
8
(b)
(2)
which
ban
discrimination
in
employment
to
encourage
union
membership.
absent,
adequate
assurances
that
job
applicants
will
be
referred
without
regard
to
union
membership
considerations.
now,
the
basis
for
the
--
for
the
board's
conclusion
is
briefly
this,
“that
an
exclusive
hiring
arrangement,
even
if
not
in
terms
restricted
to
union
members,
affects
a
discrimination
in
employment
by
treating
employees
differently
who
seek
employment
directly,
what
the
employer
is
distinguished
from
those
who
go
through
the
hiring
hall.
the
--
the
experience
of
slater
here
indicates
that.
by
going
to
the
employer
directly
for
this
job
instead
of
through
the
union
hall,
he
suffered
discharge.
he
--
he
was
able
to
get
a
job
but
he
wasn't
able
to
keep
it.
there
could
be
no
clearer
discrimination
in
employment.
however,
that
isn't
enough
to
establish
a
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(3),
8
(b)
(2).
the
discrimination
in
employment
has
to
encourage
union
membership
and
that
is
where
the
front
of
our
case
calls
occurrence.
i'm
--
i'm
showing
that
the
board
had
a
reasonable
basis
in
its
experience
for
concluding
that
a
contract
arrangement
that
require
the
employees
to
clear
through
the
union
before
they
could
get
a
job,
could
reasonably
tend
to
encourage
union
membership
adherence
to
union
policies
and
practices,
absent
--
the
safeguards
which
the
board
has
promulgated
in
which
i
will
get
to
in
a
moment.
now,
the
board
found
that
the
hiring
provisions
of
the
contract
here
required
the
motor
carrier
of
los
angeles
and
seattle
to
obtain
casual
employees
solely
through
the
dispatching
service
operated
and
controlled
by
the
union
and
that
slater
was
discharged
for
failure
to
follow
this
procedure.
and
that
the
hiring
procedure
was
invalid
because
it
did
not
contain
the
mountain
pacific
safeguards.
there's
no
question,
i
might
add
to
these
safeguards
are
three
fold.
in
the
first
place,
it
must
provide
that
--
that
the
basis
for
referral
will
be
without
regard
to
union
membership
or
compliance
with
union
rules.
the
employer
shall
have
a
right
to
reject
applicants
referred.
and
thirdly,
that
the
standards
for
operating
the
hiring
hall
should
be
posted
so
that
the
employees
will
know
what
they
are.
now,
there's
no
question
that
this
contract
here
did
not
contain
a
posting
requirement
nor
did
it
provide
for
a
right
to
reject
on
the
part
of
the
employer.
furthermore,
the
board
found
that
the
unequivocal
assurance
that
hiring
would
be
without
regard
to
union
membership
considerations
was
also
lacking
here
in
that
although,
the
contract
does
provide
that
seniority
shall
govern
dispatch.
the
gap
in
there
is
that
you
can
only
get
seniority
after
you've
worked
for
three
months
in
the
industry
and
there
is
no
assurance
in
this
contract
that
in
inquire
--
in
acquiring
the
three
months
seniority
that
you
will
be
dispatched
without
regard
to
union
membership
considerations
and
you
can
lose
seniority
if
you
are
discharged
by
an
employer.
and
that
apparently
is
what
happened
to
slater
here
that
he
had
lost
his
seniority
because
when
he
went
out
on
a
job,
he
wasn't
able
to
--
to
perform
it.
and
as
a
result,
he
had
difficulty
getting
the
union
to
refer
him
which
resulted
in
this
effort
to
get
an
authorization
from
the
international
representative
of
the
union
that
would
permit
him
to
work
without
going
through
the
hiring
hall.
and
when
the
union
learned
of
that,
they
said,
“that's
no
good,”
and
procured
his
discharge
for
not
getting
through
the
hall.
so
that
you
could
lose
seniority
under
this
arrangement
very
readily
and
there
was
no
assurance
that
you
could
build
it
backup
without
regard
to
your
adherence
to
union
rules.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
there
is
no
specific
finding
on
--
on
that,
justice
black.
there
--
the
only
thing
that
the
record
shows
is
that
slater
had
difficulty
getting
a
job
through
the
union
hall
because
of
the
fact
that
he
had
been
discharged
by
an
employer
after
being
referred
on
one
occasion.
as
a
result
of
that
difficulty,
his
landlady
tried
to
patch
things
up
and
got
this
letter
from
the
international
representative
of
the
union
that
said
it
would
be
okay
for
him
to
--
to
work
without
going
through
the
hall.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
am
not
--
i
am
not
suggesting
that
the
board
has
found
that
this
hiring
hall
was
operated
discriminatorily.
that
is
not
the
basis
for
the
--
for
the
board's
decision
i
will
get
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
--
that
is
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
without
the
--
without
the
safeguards.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
do
not
find
that
there
was
such
an
express
finding.
there
is
no
finding
that
there
was
discrimination,
let
me
--
let
me
put
it
that
way
because
this
case
was
tried
before
the
examiner
on
a
--
on
a
slightly
different
theory
and
that's
the
reason
why
there
was
an
affirmative
finding
as
--
as
mr.
thatcher
has
--
has
suggested.
the
theory
on
which
it
was
tried
was
that
slater
was
a
regular
employee
and
not
a
casual.
therefore,
he
wasn't
required
to
resort
to
the
contract
procedure
which
was
applicable
only
to
casuals
and
the
examiner
found
that
in
fact
he
was
a
casual
employee
and
that
he
was
properly
discharged
for
not
resorting
to
the
contract
procedure
and
ended
the
matter
at
--
at
that
point.
he
didn't
go
on
to
find
whether
the
hiring
hall
was
discriminatory
thoroughly
operated
or
not.
the
board
in
its
--
in
its
decision
however,
in
applying
the
mountain
pacific
principle
did
not
find
that
the
hiring
hall
was
discriminatorily
operated
because
the
board's
position
is
that
that
factor
is
irrelevant,
the
mere
existence
of
an
arrangement
that
require
as
an
employee
to
clear
through
the
union
to
get
a
job
without
warrant
inherently
encourages
union
membership.
it's
an
analogous
to
a
--
a
closed-shop
contract
which
unquestionably
standing
alone,
inherently
encourages
union
membership
and
affects
a
discrimination
which
is
violative
of
the
act.
mr.
norton
j.
come
a
union
shop
does
not
for
the
specific
reason
that
the
proviso,
the
section
8
(a)
(3)
has
a
specific
provision
that
permits
such
an
arrangement
and
that
is
all
of
it
if
it
permits.
that
is
the
sole
exceptions
of
the
general
ban
against
discrimination
in
employment
to
encourage
union
membership
which
is
set
forth
in
the
section
8
(a)
(3).
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
there's
one
big
difference,
your
honor
and
that
is
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
there,
the
difference
is
that
in
this
kind
of
a
set
up
as
with
the
closed
shop.
if
the
board's
promise
is
correct,
the
employee
is
not
going
to
get
a
chance
to
get
to
that
job
without
being
encouraged
to
become
a
union
member
and
that
is
at
that
the
threshold
of
the
protection
that
8
(a)
(3)
of
the
act
was
supposed
to
give
the
employer.
the
union
shop
doesn't
come
in
to
play
until
after
the
employee
has
gotten
a
job.
he
doesn't
have
to
be
a
union
member
or
he
isn't
supposed
to
be
influenced
towards
becoming
a
union
member
until
he
gets
on
that
job.
and
then
he's
given
30
days
to
make
up
his
mind
as
to
whether
he
wants
to
join
or
not
assuming
that
the
union
has
some
adjourn.
under
the
closed
shop,
he
can't
get
to
that
job
without
being
a
union
member
and
under
the
board's
view
of
an
exclusive
hiring
arrangement
without
the
mountain
pacific
safeguards,
the
impact
on
the
employee
is
the
same.
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
is
no
question
that
it
would
your
honor
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
but
the
point
of
--
but
the
point
is,
congress
in
--
in
balancing
the
respective
interest
here
realized
that
the
union
in
certain
circumstances
might
have
a
right
to
force
the
employee
to
make
--
make
the
decision
but
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
he
had
the
right
to
get
to
the
job
without
being
unduly
influenced.
mr.
norton
j.
come
alright,
we'll
let
me
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
well,
let
me
--
let
me
try
to
amplify
that
if
i
may,
justice
black.
and
i
--
i'd
like
to
begin
back
a
little
ways
if
i
--
if
i
may.
as
i
said
at
the
outset
as
the
--
as
the
board
views
section
8
(a)
(3)
and
we
believe
that
this
court's
approach
to
that
section
and
its
counter
part
8
(b)
(2)
and
the
radio
officers
case
supports
that.
there
are
two
elements
to
the
violation.
you
have
to
have
a
discrimination
in
employment
and
the
discrimination
in
employment
must
encourage
union
membership.
now,
in
radio
officers,
this
court
held
that
you
either
--
that
you
didn't
have
to
--
that
you
didn't
have
to
prove
a
purpose
to
encourage,
although
you
i
believe
dissented
from
that
holding,
your
honor.
if
it
was
reasonably
foreseeable
from
the
nature
of
the
discrimination,
if
it
was
then
you
could
impute
the
intent
to
encourage
under
the
common
law
of
principle
that
one
is
presumed
to
intend
the
reasonable
consequences
of
his
acts.
mr.
norton
j.
come
now,
the
--
that
is
correct.
so,
that
you
need
your
discrimination
in
employment
and
it
must
be
of
such
a
nature
that
it
would
reasonably
tend
to
or
the
foreseeable
consequence
of
that
is
to
encourage
union
membership
and
radio
officers
holds
that
union
membership
means
not
only
to
become
a
union
member
but
to
be
a
good
union
member.
in
other
words,
comply
even
if
you
are
a
union
member
or
with
the
--
with
the
union
rules.
now,
the
discrimination,
the
board
finds
in
the
despair
treatment
between
the
employee
who
has
to
go
through
the
hiring
hall
and
the
employee
who
tries
to
get
the
job
directly.
now,
so,
you
have
--
you
have
the
discrimination
in
employment
in
the
board's
view
and
the
question
is,
"can
it
be
said
that
a
foreseeable
consequence
of
--
of
requiring
employees
to
go
through
to
the
union
in
order
to
get
a
job
is
that
they
will
be
encouraged
if
they're
not
union
members
to
become
union
members
or
if
they
are
a
union
member
to
make
sure
that
they're
in
good
standing?"
now,
the
board,
as
a
result
of
its
experience
with
these
hiring
hall
cases
in
the
10
years
that
they
lived
with
them
since
the
enactment
of
taft-hartley,
found
that
despite
the
--
the
ban
on
--
on
closed
shops
that
taft-hartley
was
supposed
to
have
imposed,
the
closed
shop
continue
to
exist
and
by
enlarge,
it
was
present
in
the
situations
of
intermittent
employment
where
the
hiring
hall
was
the
--
was
the
basis
on
which
employees
had
to
get
jobs.
the
board
concluded
that
in
the
light
of
what
the
employees
in
these
industries
knew
about
the
way
the
hiring
hall
was
operated.
it
was
reasonable
to
infer
that
they
would
tend
to
be
encouraged
for
union
membership
if
all
that
you
said
was,
“you
had
to
go
through
the
union
in
order
to
get
a
job.”
in
other
words,
that
discrimination
tended
to
encourage
union
membership
as
the
first
circuit
summed
up
in
the
case
in
which
they
held
with
this
which
is
referred
to
in
our
brief
and
if
i
may
quote
for
a
moment.
"in
our
opinion,
the
board
could
well
conclude
that
an
applicant
who
must
be
cleared
for
a
job
by
a
union
hiring
hall
will
fear
that
his
opportunity
of
selection
will
be
small
if
he
does
not
become
a
union
member
in
view
of
the
widely
accepted
belief
often
encouraged
by
unions
themselves
that
hiring
halls
do
operate
in
a
discriminatory
nature."
so,
the
basis
of
the
board's
mountain
pacific
decision
is
not
that
the
union
would
necessarily
discriminate
in
referring
but
that
the
employees
would
reasonably
tend
to
believe
that
if
they
were
a
union
member,
they
would
stand
a
better
chance
of
getting
a
job.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
board
believes
that
that
encouragement,
that
unlawful
encouragement
would
be
minimized
substantially
by
the
conditions
which
the
board
has
enunciated
in
the
--
in
the
mountain
pacific
decision.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
would
be
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
what
is
--
what
is
that
your
honor?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
if
i
understand
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
if
--
if
despite
these
conditions
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
board
feels
that
there
is
an
inherent
encouragement
in
the
--
in
the
contract
provision
standing
even
apart
from
the
--
its
discriminatory
operation.
there's
no
question
that
a
closed
shop
contract
for
example,
standing
alone
without
regard
to
its
application
violates
the
act
because
on
its
face,
that
has
an
inherent
--
well,
it
--
it
affects
a
discrimination
and
it
has
an
inherent
encouraging
effect.
in
the
board's
view,
an
exclusive
hiring
hall
contract
without
the
safeguards
has
the
--
has
the
same
effect
and
we
submit
that
the
board
could
reasonably
make
that
judgment
in
the
light
of
its
experience
with
hiring
halls.
but
the
point
that
i
want
to
make
is
that
the
safeguards
go
to
cure
the
unlawful
encouragement.
they
do
not
bear
on
the
discrimination
because
in
the
board's
view
that
exist
from
the
fact
that
the
hiring
hall
sets
up
this
arrangement,
whereby
you're
going
to
be
fired
if
you
don't
go
through
the
union
to
get
a
job.
the
mere
fact
that
that
rule
was
applied
uniformly
isn't
enough
to
save
it
from
being
discriminatory
if
it
has
the
encouraging
effects
that
are
prescribed
by
--
by
8
(a)
(3)
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
shelley
against
kraemer,
the
indiscriminate
application
of
--
of
a
--
of
an
--
of
any
qualities
doesn't
--
doesn't
make
it
proper.
i
mean,
the
mere
fact
that
--
that
this
hiring
hall
is
--
is
applied
to
all
casual
employees
doesn't
assure
the
defect
in
it
if
the
board
is
correct
in
saying
that
it
has
this
inherent
encouraging
effect.
and
the
safeguards
that
the
board
has
promulgated
go
toward
mitigating
the
unlawful
encouragement
and
if
it
is
viewed
in
that
light,
then
i
think
much
of
the
union's
argument
as
to
how
could
they
conceivably
have
any
reasonable
relationship
to
the
problem
disappears
because
they
are
not
addressed
to
the
presumption
that
the
union
is
going
to
discriminate.
they're
addressed
to
the
dissipating
of
the
beliefs
of
the
employees
that
they
will
be
better
treated
if
they
adhere
to
union
policies
and
--
and
union
rules
because
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
right
to
reject
bears
on
the
point
that
the
board
judgment
is
that
the
employee
will
feel
that
if
he
has
to
go
to
the
union
in
order
to
get
a
job,
the
question
that
is
going
to
govern
the
union
in
referring
him
is
not
necessarily
what
skills
does
he
posses
but
how
well
has
he
complied
with
union
policies
and
how
good
standing
is
he
in
union
affairs.
if
the
employer
is
given
the
right
to
reject,
the
board
believes
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
point
is
that
just
because
seniority
is
--
is
made
the
basis,
that
doesn't
necessarily
end
it
if
there
is
--
if
the
board
is
correct
that
requiring
the
union
to
be
the
exclusive
operator
of
this
arrangement
has
an
inherently
encouraging
effect.
the
mere
fact
it's
put
in
a
contract
doesn't
establish
the
legality
of
the
--
of
the
procedure.
the
union
for
example,
couldn't
agree
to
a
contract
provision
that
made
seniority
depend
upon
when
an
employee
became
a
union
member.
we
have
to
look
to
more
than
the
fact
that
seniority
here
is
made
the
basis
for
the
--
for
the
referral.
i've
pointed
out
that
you
may
never
get
enough
service
to
acquire
seniority
here
under
this
arrangement.
there
is
no
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
board
feels
that
if
you're
going
to
give
the
union
the
exclusive
power
to
clear
people
for
employment
without
any
safeguards
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
there's
no
question
that
the
board
could
do
that,
mr.
justice
black,
they
could
also
hold
a
union
and
an
employer
liable
if
they
should
require
an
employee
to
join
a
union
as
a
condition
of
getting
employment.
in
other
words,
a
closed
shop
arrangement
but
you
have
an
additional
violation
from
the
mere
fact
that
this
contract
is
standing
there
over
the
heads
of
the
employees
if
the
type
of
provision
and
in
the
board's
view,
this
hiring
hall
arrangement
is
such
is
of
such
a
nature
that
it
would
discourage
them
or
encourage
them
before
they
ever
get
to
--
get
the
first
base.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
let
me
tell
you
what
congress
says
as
gone
here.
in
the
first
place,
with
respect
to
the
taft-hartley
amendments
which
banned
the
closed
shop,
the
classic
example
that
was
given
of
a
closed
shop
was
in
the
context
of
the
hiring
hall
arrangement.
senator
taft
pointed
to
the
case
of
the
maritime
industry.
you
had
the
closed
shop
going
hand
and
hand
with
the
--
with
the
hiring
hall.
however,
in
enacting
the
taft-hartley
amendments,
they
did
not
specifically
outlaw
the
hiring
hall
as
such.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor.
to
my
knowledge,
there
was
--
there
was
not
but
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
let
me
--
let
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
let
me
tell
you
what
--
what
happened.
we
have
the
taft
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
--
i'd
like
to
--
to
cover
that
if
i
may.
you
have
the
47
situation
where
senator
taft
talks
about
the
hiring
hall
going
hand
and
hand
with
the
closed
shop
and
one
of
the
vises
that
he
pointed
out
about
the
hiring
hall
was
the
employer
had
no
right
to
select
the
people
who
he
would
employ.
in
other
words,
the
employer
had
had
no
right
to
reject.
he
had
to
take
whoever
the
--
the
union
referred.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
what
can
you
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
what
--
what
you
had
was
the
amendment
of
the
proviso
to
8
(a)
(3)
which
banned
the
closed
shop.
in
the
next
session
of
congress,
which
was
in
1949,
you
had
the
thomas
bill
which
would
have
restored
the
closed
shop.
and
senator
taft
proposed
an
amendment
which
would
have
returned
to
the
taft-hartley
union
shop
provision
and
he
tapped
on
a
proviso
to
that
that
said
that
the
employer
provided
however,
that
the
employer
should
have
the
right
to
call
upon
the
union
to
refer
people
provided
that
the
employer
had
the
right
to
reject
them
because
if
they
didn't
have
the
right
to
reject
then
that
would
be
a
violation
of
--
of
present
law.
that
provision
passed
to
senate
but
it
died
in
the
house.
it
was
--
it
was
not
enacted.
in
the
next
session
in
1950,
you
had
a
proposal
by
senator
magnusson
to
authorize
the
hiring
hall
in
the
closed
shop
in
the
maritime
industry.
that
provision
was
not
enacted.
thereafter,
you
get
nothing
until
--
to
my
knowledge
until
you
get
to
the
landrum-griffin
amendments
in
1959
and
this
is
what
you
get
there
and
i
think
this
is
addressed
to
a
question
that
--
also
that
mr.
justice
brennan
mentioned.
in
8
(f)
of
the
landrum-griffin
amendments,
congress
gave
special
treatment
to
the
building
trades
and
in
this
8
(f),
they
provided
that
it
would
not
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
the
building
trades
to
enter
into
so
called
“free
hire
agreements,”
that
is
a
contract
between
a
union
and
an
employer
that
would
recognize
the
union
as
the
bargaining
agent
before
any
employees
had
been
hired
which
would
ordinarily
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
furthermore,
they
could
provide
in
that
contract
without
permitting
an
unfair
labor
practice
that
the
employees
could
be
required
to
join
the
union
seven
days
after
employment
as
distinguished
from
the
30
days
in
the
8
(a)
(3)
proviso.
and
furthermore,
it
would
not
be
unlawful
for
the
employer
and
the
union
to
incorporate
in
--
in
such
an
agreement
a
provision
that
would
require
that
the
union
be
given
an
opportunity
to
refer
applicants
according
to
objective
criteria
such
as
length
of
time
in
the
area
and
things
of
that
sort.
now,
that
proposal
when
it
was
introduced
and
was
ultimately
enacted
was
criticized
on
the
ground
that
it
would
permit
hiring
hall
arrangements
without
regard
to
the
safeguards
that
the
board
had
in
its
mountain
--
had
enunciated
in
its
mountain
pacific
decision.
and
when
this
was
enacted,
you
have
a
specific
provision
in
the
house
conference
report
which
is
referred
to
on
our
briefs
that
specifically
says
that
nothing
in
this
8
(f)
shall
be
construed
to
affect
the
applicability
of
the
board's
mountain
pacific
decision,
citing
the
decision
and
the
--
and
the
citation.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
i
can
find
it
fairly
quickly,
your
honor.
it's
on
pages
44
and
45
of
our
brief,
footnote
23.
now,
to
the
best
of
my
recollection,
that
is
the
extent
of
the
congressional
history
of
this
--
of
this
problem.
the
board
feels
that
the
grant
in
section
8
(a)
(3)
and
in
section
8
(b)
(2)
to
prohibit
discrimination
in
employment
which
tends
to
encourage
union
membership
is
sufficient
to
enable
it
to
cover
a
situation
such
as
we
have
here
without
a
specific
provision
in
the
--
in
the
act.
this
was
one
of
those
problems
that
congress
left
to
the
administrative
agency
to
work
out
on
the
basis
of
its
experience
as
it
did
with
respect
to
balancing
the
interest
of
employers
and
unions
and
with
respect
to
no
--
the
solicitation
of
union
membership
and
analogous
of
problems
of
that
sort.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
the
--
that
the
--
the
board
would
have
probably
treated
it
as
--
as
legal.
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
think
that
this
is
one
of
those
problems
like
with
respect
to
the
--
like
the
hot
cargo
clause
problem
for
example,
where
the
board
as
a
result
of
its
continued
experience
with
the
problem
has
decided
that
they
were
wrong
the
first
time
and
the
experience
has
shown
that
the
--
that
the
hiring
hall
itself,
an
exclusive
hiring
hall
i'm
talking
about,
not
a
--
a
non-exclusive
one
where
the
employer
would
be
free
to
--
to
hire
on
his
own
but
an
exclusive
hiring
hall
that
requires
that
the
employee
come
through
that
union
hall
before
he
can
get
a
job.
at
that
standing
alone
without
the
safeguards
is
inherently
encouraging
to
union
membership
adherence
the
union
rules
and
at
it
--
this
inference
an
incur
of
--
that
it
has
this
effect
is
a
reasonable
one
that
the
board
was
entitled
to
go
out
based
on
its
--
on
its
experience
and
that
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
it
represents
the
board's
judgment
that
8
(a)
(3)
outlaws
these
arrangements.
most
--
most
of
them
have
been
operated
in
conjunction
with
the
closed
shop.
it's
only
been
since
taft-hartley
that
--
where
--
which
specifically
banned
the
closed
shop
that
you
would
get
a
union
reporting
to
operate
a
--
a
hall
without
specifically
imposing
a
closed
shop
and
the
board's
experience
in
these
cases
since
taft-hartley
found
that
even
those
cases
were
relatively
few,
that
most
of
the
cases
show
that
the
--
that
the
hiring
hall
continued
to
be
operated
in
conjunction
with
the
--
with
the
closed
shop.
but
the
board
has
determined
that
whether
you
can
show
that
it
has
been
operated
that
way
or
not
standing
alone
without
the
safeguards,
it
violates
the
act.
the
only
thing
i'm
trying
to
point
out
is
that
although
this
is
the
board's
interpretation
of
8
(a)
(3),
it's
been
the
kind
of
problem
that
the
board
could
understandably
come
to
this
view
only
after
some
experience
because
it
hasn't
been
the
traditional
way
in
which
these
hiring
halls
have
operated
historically
and
operated
as
an
adjunct
of
the
closed
shop.
that
part
has
been
kicked
out
by
taft-hartley
and
it's
only
been
since
taft-hartley
that
the
board
has
had
to
face
up
to
the
problem
of,
"well,
what
about
the
hiring
hall
standing
alone?"
and
it
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
that
standing
alone
without
the
safeguards
violates
8
(a)
(3)
as
well
as
one
that
would
be
discriminatorily
operated
for
the
reasons
i've
indicated.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
--
i
think
that
the
contract
would
have
been
valid
if
it
had
three
conditions.
it
doesn't
have
any
of
the
--
of
the
three
conditions
that
the
board
laid
down
in
mountain
pacific
and
not
only
does
not
leave
the
employer
the
right
to
reject.
it
does
not
provide
or
posting
of
the
conditions
under
which
the
hiring
hall
are
going
to
be
operated
so
that
the
employees
can
see
what
those
objective
criteria
are
and
thirdly,
they
guarantee
that
the
hall
was
going
to
be
operated
without
regard
to
union
membership
considerations
that
is
set
forth
in
the
contract
is
not
an
adequate
one
because
it
does
not
cover
the
period
during
which
seniority
status
is
going
to
be
acquire.
mr.
norton
j.
come
if
they
actually
discriminated,
it
would
not
be
justice
black
but
you
have
those
cases
where
you
may
not
get
the
employee
complaining
to
you.
he
might
have
been
detoured
by
--
if
the
board
is
correct
by
this
inherently
encouraging
system
and
thereby
comply
with
the
union
rules
and
to
that
extent
in
that
hall
area,
you
would
be
having
a
--
an
impairment
of
the
--
of
the
congressional
policy
here.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we
think
that
the
--
of
course
the
question
is
whether
the
board
has
the
power
to
do
it.
we
think
that
we
have
a
specific
grant
of
authority
adequate
to
handle
the
problem
in
8
(a)
(3).
congress
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
yes
it
did,
your
honor
but
we
also
gained
experience
in
the
--
in
these
cases
in
that
time
too.
mr.
norton
j.
come
what
is
that
your
honor?
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
you
needed
awhile
for
these
cases
--
cases
to
build
up
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
we've
--
we've
tried
to
list
this
in
appendix
to
our
brief,
a
sample
of
the
--
of
the
board's
experience
in
this
--
in
this
area.
and
we
submit
that
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
i
also
tried
to
indicate
that
we
had
relatively
few
cases
that
presented
the
naked
problem.
most
of
the
cases
up
until
then
had
been
ones
where
you
had
had
discrimination
in
addition.
you
had
the
hall
operated
discriminatorily.
and
there
were
relatively
few
cases
in
which
you
had
merely
a
hiring
hall
and
nothing
more
and
in
those
cases,
you
do
have
an
indication
that
the
--
that
the
board
would
not
have
considered
that
enough.
but
as
a
result
of
its
further
experience
with
the
problem,
the
board
did
change
its
view
but
it
has
only
been
after
considerable
experience
with
the
problem
that
you
begin
to
get
cases
in
the
naked
form,
i
mean
at
least
in
considerable
quantity
that
you're
having
them
in
--
now
and
that
are
exhibited
in
--
in
this
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
in
--
in
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we
have
to
wait
for
a
charge
your
honor
and
i
mean
the
board
is
not
free
to
--
to
act
unless
--
unless
a
charge
is
--
is
filed.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
as
for
that
reason
that
the
board
has
tried
to
engage
in
prevented
medicine
as
it
were
by
enunciating
what
the
standards
are
which
they
believe
would
cure
the
illegal
encouragement
in
the
hiring
hall
problem.
and
i
further
believe
that
most
of
the
unions
have
conformed
their
contracts
to
the
--
to
the
mountain
pacific
requirements.
thank
you
your
honor.
