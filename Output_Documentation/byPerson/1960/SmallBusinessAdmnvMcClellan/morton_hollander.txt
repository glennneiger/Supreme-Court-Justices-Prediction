mr.
morton
hollander
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
out
of
a
vague
bankruptcy
proceeding.
it's
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
petitioner
is
the
small
business
administration
which
is
here
challenging
the
denial
by
the
court
below
of
a
statutory
right
explicitly
conferred
upon
the
government
by
the
congress
more
than
160
years
ago,
the
claim
of
priority
in
the
distribution
of
the
assets
of
the
estate
of
an
insolvent
debtor.
the
priority
actually
was
written
into
the
statute
purposes
far
back
as
1797.
that
is
one
of
the
two
principal
statutes
with
which
we
are
here
concerned.
we
set
forth
the
text
of
that
statute
on
page
3
of
our
brief.
it
provides
--
it
provides
in
--
in
very
broad
unequivocal
terms
that
whenever
any
person
indebted
the
united
states
is
insolvent,
the
debts
due
to
the
united
states
shall
first
be
satisfied.
the
other
pivotal
statute
with
which
this
case
is
concerned
is
the
bankruptcy
act’s
priority
provisions
themselves.
now
in
the
bankruptcy
act,
the
congress
has
carried
over
this
right
of
priority
under
the
1797
statute
and
actually
converted
it
into
a
fifth
class
priority
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding.
it
is
that
fifth
class
priority,
the
small
business
administration
claims
it
is
entitled
to
in
this
case
and
it
is
that
fifth
class
priority
that
was
denied
to
the
small
business
administration
by
the
courts
below.
i
would
like
briefly
to
review
the
facts
out
of
which
this
controversy
emerges.
in
the
--
in
november
of
1956,
byquist,
the
bankrupt
in
this
case,
a
small
wholesaler
of
electronic
supplies
and
radio
equipment,
needed
additional
working
capital.
he
solicited
the
aid
of
both
the
small
business
administration
and
a
local
bank,
a
private
bank,
the
brookville
state
bank
of
kansas.
he
filed
applications
with
them
under
the
small
business
administration
act
for
a
loan
of
$20,000.
the
bank
took
the
position
that
it
wasn't
ready
to
extend
the
full
$20,000
credit
to
him
but
that
if
the
united
states
government
would
participate
with
the
bank,
the
brookville
state
bank
and
advanced
$15,000
of
the
entire
$20,000
loan
sought
by
byquist,
the
bank
would
add
the
additional
$5000
and
the
$20,000
loan
could
be
extended
to
mr.
byquist.
the
bank
took
this
matter
up
with
the
small
business
administration.
the
small
business
administration
agreed
to
enter
into
a
participation
agreement
with
the
bank
so
that
the
united
states
would
advance
75%
of
the
loan
or
$15,000
with
the
bank
advancing
the
remaining
$5,000.
at
the
time
the
united
states
entered
into
this
--
to
the
small
business
administration
--
entered
into
this
participation
agreement
with
the
bank
and
notified
mr.
byquist
directly
that
his
application
has
been
approved.
in
the
participation
agreement,
and
i
would
like
to
invite
your
honors
attention
to
page
5
of
our
brief
because
this
is
one
of
the
crucial
provisions
in
the
participation
agreement
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
seize
in
order
to
justify
its
forfeiture
of
this
long
standing
priority
dated
back
in
1797.
the
--
on
page
5,
we
set
forth
two
of
--
in
quotes,
two
of
the
provisions
of
the
participation
agreement.
the
first
one,
paragraph
12,
points
out
in
effect
that
whenever
any
collection
is
made
under
the
loan
from
the
borrower,
the
proceeds
are
to
be
shared
proportionately
with
both
lenders,
and
that
is
three-fourths
of
each
collection
has
to
go
to
the
united
states
and
the
remaining
one-fourth
to
the
bank.
paragraph
14,
the
particular
paragraph
that
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on,
also
points
out
that
--
in
the
event
that
there
should
be
a
loss
under
the
loan.
the
loss
should
be
shared
in
proportion
to
the
investment
of
the
united
states
in
the
one
hand
and
the
bank
on
the
other.
in
other
words,
if
there's
a
loss,
united
states
gets
stock
to
the
extent
of
three-fourths
of
its
interest
and
the
bank
only
to
the
extent
of
its
25%
interest.
mr.
morton
hollander
the
government
did
not
reduce
its
claim,
your
honor.
i
will
get
to
that.
i'll
get
to
that
in
just
one
minute.
mr.
morton
hollander
the
--
the
government
--
what
happened
was
this.
the
--
the
--
in
order
to
answer
your
honors
question,
i'll
have
to
explain
exactly
what
happened
with
the
--
with
the
amount
in
the
loan.
no,
i
think
it's
crucial.
i
think
--
i
think
your
honors
question
actually
is
crucial
to
the
government's
position
in
this
case.
as
soon
as
--
as
soon
as
the
bank
had
agreed
with
the
united
states,
united
states
agreed
to
supply
$15,000.
united
states
sent
its
check
drawn
on
the
united
states
treasury
for
$15,000
to
the
brookville
bank.
brookville
bank
took
the
proceeds
of
that
check,
added
$5,000
of
its
own
money
to
it
and
made
out
a
check
to
byquist
for
$20,000,
getting
in
exchange
byquist’s
note
for
$20,000,
made
out
payable
to
the
bank.
about
a
year
elapsed
byquist
repaid
about
$4000
of
the
outstanding
note,
$3000
going
to
the
united
states,
and
$1000
going
to
the
bank.
and
he
was
thrown
at
the
bankruptcy
at
that
point,
about
a
year
after
the
note
had
been
given
to
the
bank.
when
there
was
a
balance
of
$16,000
due
on
the
--
on
the
note.
after
the
bankruptcy,
there
was
a
formal
assignment
of
the
note
itself
from
the
bank
to
the
united
states
government.
and
it
was
at
that
point,
in
answer
to
your
question,
that
the
united
states
filed
on
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
in
effect,
a
claim
on
its
own
behalf
for
the
$12,000
due
here
on
the
note
and
also
a
claim
on
behalf
of
the
bank
for
the
$4000
due
the
bank
on
its
share
of
the
note.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes.
it
was
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
it
was.
no.
that's
absolutely
right.
in
other
words,
the
government
lump
both
of
them
together
but
has
made
it
absolutely
clear
throughout
this
proce
--
throughout
the
proceeding
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court,
the
referee,
that
the
only
portion
of
that
$16,000
obligation
is
to
which
the
government
was
insisting,
it
had
a
right
to
priority
under
3466,
the
19
--
1797
statute
and
the
pertinent
provision
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
the
only
portion
of
that
$16,000
loan
as
to
which
the
government
claim
that
it
had
a
right
to
priority
was
the
$12,000
portion
of
the
loan
representing
the
federal
government's
investment
in
that
loan.
mr.
morton
hollander
absolutely,
your
honor.
it
was
--
it
was
for
75%
of
the
outstanding
balance
just
as
it
had
been
for
75%
of
the
original
face
value.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor,
$4000
was
inserted
as
general.
mr.
morton
hollander
it
actually
resulted
in
the
termination
of
the
participation
agreement,
in
the
sense
that
the
united
states
had
actually
acquired
from
the
bank
at
that
point
the
bank’s
25%
interest
in
the
--
in
the
loan.
mr.
morton
hollander
with
the
understanding
--
with
the
understanding
of
course
that
the
government
was
acting
simply
as
a
collection
agent.
under
the
participation
agreement,
it
--
it
in
effect
--
the
participation
agreement
in
effect
permitted
either
the
bank
or
the
united
states
that
the
option
of
the
united
states
to
act
as
collection
agent
for
any
of
the
proceeds
affected
by
way
of
recovery
under
the
loan.
up
until
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
to
the
extent
--
to
the
extent
that
--
to
the
extent
that
the
united
states
has
to
honor
its
contractual
commitment
under
the
participation
agreement
to
share
ratably
or
proportionately
with
the
bank
so
far
as
any
loss
is
incurred
under
the
--
under
this
particular
notice
is
concerned,
of
course,
it's
still
--
we
--
we
believe
it
still
retains
its
--
the
full
vitality
it
had
at
the
time
the
arrangement
itself
was
entered
into.
and
the
united
states
of
course
stands
ready
to
honor
its
commitment
under
the
share
ratably
--
a
share
ratable
over
share
proportional
provision.
mr.
morton
hollander
the
bank
would
have
gotten
thousand,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
you're
--
you're
--
that's
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
right.
i
don't
know
whether
under
those
circumstances,
some
adjustment
might
have
to
be
made
in
order
to
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
under
the
agreement
to
put
the
united
states
in
the
same
position
as
the
bank.
i'm
not
sure.
but
--
mr.
morton
hollander
i
shouldn't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
shouldn't
think
that
it's
a
pertinent
consideration
to
the
bankruptcy
court
at
all,
just
as
much
as
if
the
united
states
had
decided
the
very
last
minute
to
waive
whatever
rights
it
might
have
had
under
this
agreement
and
to
--
to
leave
the
parties
in
the
status
quo.
the
--
the
government
after
filing
its
claim
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding,
had
the
claim
rejected
by
the
referee
on
the
ground
that
this
claim
was
not
one
due
to
united
states
but
was
in
fact
due
to
some
separate
entity.
on
appeal
to
the
district
court,
the
district
court
was
dissatisfied
with
the
reason
the
referee
had
given
for
rejecting
the
government's
claim
and
felt
that
the
claim
should
be
denied
because
the
government,
the
district
court
thought
was
asserting
a
claim
acquired
by
it
for
the
first
time
after
the
petition
of
bankruptcy
has
been
filed.
now
the
court
of
appeals,
apparently
dissatisfied
with
both
of
those
grounds,
seized
upon
this
third
justification
for
denial
of
the
government's
priority
and
that
justification
arises
out
of
the
language
in
article
14
of
the
participation
agreement.
the
court
of
appeals
was
of
the
view
that
since
the
united
states
under
this
loss
ratable
provision
and
participation
agreement
would
have
to
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out,
turn
over
$3000
of
the
$12,000
it
would
recoup
if
its
priority
were
recognized,
it
would
have
to
turn
over
$3000
to
that
$12,000
to
the
private
bank.
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
this
violated
some
long
standing
principle
of
interpretation
under
3466,
namely,
that
the
united
states
was
in
effect
collecting
by
exercising
its
right
to
priority
for
the
benefit
of
a
private
party.
mr.
morton
hollander
under
the
agreement,
i
think
--
under
the
agreement
i
think
the
parties,
your
honor,
would
have
to
strike
a
balance
and
after
recoveries
of
--
mr.
morton
hollander
the
--
the
agreement
does
provide
that
--
that
parties
shall
share
ratably
or
proportionately.
all
losses
are
sustained
under
the
agreements.
so
i
think
irrespectively
meant
the
bank
recovered
in
the
other
from
one
hand
of
the
amount
that
the
united
states
government
recovered
on
the
other.
they
would
have
to
strike
a
balance
and
then
a
portion
of
the
loss,
25%
of
the
loss
with
the
bank
and
three-fourths
of
the
loss
to
the
united
states
government.
now
the
--
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
say,
invoked
the
theory
that
since
the
united
states
at
least
impart
had
to
turnover
the
part
of
the
proceeds,
it
was
going
to
recoup
to
the
private
bank
that
it
was
therefore
not
entitled
to
the
priority
established
by
3466.
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
connection
relied,
i
think,
exclusively
on
this
court's
earlier
decision
in
the
nathanson
case,
nathanson
against
national
labor
relations
board.
now,
i
have
time
i
think
to
--
two
minutes
to
just
briefly
describe
the
facts.
tomorrow,
i
hope
to
be
able
to
distinguish
that
case
adequately
but
the
facts
in
this
case
with
which
i
would
like
to
leave
the
court
this
afternoon
are
simply
these.
the
--
in
the
nathanson
case.
the
national
labor
relations
board
issued
a
backpay
order.
it
directed
an
employer
of
certain
bus
company
up
in
massachusetts
to
pay
several
thousands
of
dollars
in
backpay
to
some
employees
with
respect
to
only
the
employer
is
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
bus
company
was
thrown
into
bankruptcy,
and
at
that
point,
the
board
filed
a
claim
on
behalf
of
all
of
the
employees
in
who
is
in
favor
of
the
backpay
award
has
been
made.
and
it
filed
a
claim
under
the
bankruptcy
act
and
it
claimed
the
priority
under
3466
and
64
--
section
64
(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
act
said
that
these
claims
should
first
be
satisfied
because
of
the
government's
priority.
and
this
court,
i
think
quite
properly
in
a
case
point
that
--
that
after
all,
the
whole
underlying
purpose
of
the
federal
priority
statutes
is
to
enable
the
federal
government
to
secure
it
to
any
sufficient
public
revenue
to
sustain
the
public
burden
and
to
discharge
the
public
debt.
and
the
court
pointed
that
quite
naturally
that
any
recovery
or
backpay
in
this
bankruptcy
proceeding
were
necessarily
new
or
exclusively
to
the
benefit
of
the
employees
in
whose
favor
the
backpay
award
has
been
made.
and
the
--
the
court
by
putting
those
two
concepts
together,
i
think
came
up
to
the
inevitable
conclusion
that
since
the
priority
in
that
case
sought
to
be
asserted
on
behalf
by
the
national
labor
relations
board,
on
behalf
of
the
employees
with
not
a
single
penny,
that
priority
have
recognized
whatever
intuitive
benefit
of
the
federal
treasury
can
never
be
used
to
sustain
any
part
of
the
public
burden.
well
obviously,
the
government
was
not
entitled
to
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
morton
hollander
here,
the
government
would
get
75%,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
afternoon,
i
finished
discussing
the
facts
in
the
nathanson
case,
the
labor
board
case
in
which
this
court
denied,
i
think,
quite
properly,
the
national
labor
relations
board
a
priority
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
for
a
backpay
award.
the
backpay
award
in
that
case
had
the
priority
been
recognized,
would
have
been
--
you
had
exclusively
to
the
benefit
of
each
of
the
individual
employees
involved.
now,
it
was
exclusively
on
the
basis
of
the
nathanson
decision,
as
i
read
the
opinion
in
the
court
below,
that
the
--
a
court
below
found
a
fatal
infirmity
in
small
business
administration's
insistence
that
it
was
entitled
to
a
priority
in
this
case.
but
the
--
the
obvious
distinction
that
leaps
to
mind
so
far
as
the
comparison
of
the
nathanson
case
with
our
case
is
concerned
is
that
in
our
case,
unquestionably,
three-fourths,
three-fourths
of
the
priority,
if
recognized,
will
stay
in
the
federal
treasury.
indeed,
the
entire
recovery
of
the
$12,000
which
the
government
insists
it
is
entitled
to
by
way
of
priority
in
this
bankruptcy
proceeding,
will
go
to
the
federal
treasury.
it
is
true
that
under
this
separate
and
contractual
arrangement
with
the
bank
at
sometime,
the
united
states
will
have
to
pay
over
to
the
bank
one-fourth
of
$12,000
and
not,
of
course,
necessarily
any
of
these
funds.
these
funds
are
not
earmarked
to
the
bank.
all
of
the
money
collected
by
the
government,
if
its
priority
is
recognized
is
turned
into
the
federal
treasury.
i
think
two-way,
a
--
a
very
significant,
a
very
significant
distinction
between
nathanson
and
this
case
is
the
fact
that
in
this
case,
we
do
have
conclusive
congressional
manifestation
that
the
general
priority
under
3466
recognized
in
favor
of
the
government
and
its
agencies
as
far
back
as
1797,
that
this
priority
was
to
be
preserved
intact
so
far
as
the
sba
was
concerned.
after
the
small
business
administration
act
has
been
on
the
statute
about
five
years,
it
was
proposed
by
a
senator
to
strip
the
sba
of
the
priority
everybody
thought
it
had.
indeed,
the
priority
we
all
thought
it
had
until
the
decisions
of
the
court
below
challenged
that
priority.
and
senator
payne
introduced
in
1958,
introduced
into
the
congress
a
bill
which
would,
in
expressed
terms,
have
deprived
the
sba
of
their
priority
under
section
3466,
the
1797
statute.
mr.
morton
hollander
there
was
understandably
considerable
consternation
when
this
bill
was
introduced.
the
sba
objected
vehemently
and
as
a
result,
the
bill,
in
the
form
of
which
is
--
in
which
it
was
introduced,
which
would've
wiped
out
the
governmental
priority,
which
would,
in
fact,
have
reached
the
--
have
resulted
in
the
same
situation
as
that
required
by
the
decision
of
the
court
below
in
this
case.
that
bill
was
never
reported
out.
instead,
a
much
water
down
substitute
was
finally
passed
by
congress.
and
in
this
1958
amendment,
with
the
agreement
of
the
small
business
administration,
congress
provided,
in
effect,
that
the
federal
government's
priority
under
3466
should
be
made
to
yield
only
to
certain
state
and
local
tax
lanes
but
not
--
but
not
to
the
claims
of
the
general
unsecured
creditors
who
are
involved
in
this
litigation.
we
think
too
that
a
--
another
--
a
third
--
a
very
vital
distinction
between
nathanson
and
this
case
is
that
in
nathanson,
obviously,
none
of
the
moneys
which
would've
been
recovered
by
the
board,
as
i
pointed
out,
would
have
possibly
been
enable
to
help
sustain
the
public
burden.
and
because
of
that,
the
numerous
admonitions
of
this
court
that
section
3466
is
to
be
liberally
applied,
this
court
has
pointed
in
--
in
a
host
of
decisions
that
the
mandate
of
section
30
--
of
30
--
section
3466
is
--
is
broad.
it's
clear,
it's
unequivocal.
and
when
it
says
that
the
text
of
the
united
states
shall
first
be
satisfied,
that's
--
that's
expressly
what
it
means.
and
the
reason
for
the
broad
interpretation,
of
course,
was
the
need
for
assuring
adequate
public
revenue
to
sustain
the
public
burden
and
to
discharge
the
public
debt.
well,
in
nathanson
this
court
wasn't
concerned
with
that
broad
policy
of
interpretation,
which
was
essential
to
apply
in
order
to
help
secure
adequate
public
revenue
because,
as
i
pointed
out
in
nathanson,
no
public
revenue
at
all
was
involved.
that's
not
true
in
this
case.
as
i
pointed
out
in
this
case,
every
cent
of
that
$12,000
goes
into
the
federal
treasury.
it
is
true
that
under
our
contractual
arrangement
with
the
bank,
at
some
later
date,
the
bank
will
get
a
part
of
the
proceeds
of
that
loan.
one
other
--
one
other
distinction,
i
don't
want
to
belabor
this
point
but
i
feel,
i
--
i
have
this
--
mr.
morton
hollander
a
--
oh,
well
--
mr.
morton
hollander
the
--
the
statute
doesn't
--
as
--
probably
as
true
of
every
other
statute
authorizing
the
government
to
engage
in
a
lending
program
of
this
sort.
it
doesn't
spell
out
the
details
of
the
arrangement
but
it
definitely
encourages
the
participation
arrangement,
the
participation
agreement
arrangement.
mr.
morton
hollander
there
is
no
expressed
provision
requiring
the
small
business
administration
in
its
contract
with
the
bank
to
say
that
of
the
proceeds
recovered
by
the
parties,
there
shall
be
--
they
shall
be
distributed
in
accordance
with
their
respective
investment
or
interest
in
the
loan.
no,
that
provision
is
not
the
--
the
statute
does
make
it
very
plain,
however,
that
a
participation
agreement
is
to
be
encouraged
and
that
if
participation
agreements
are
available,
the
small
business
administration
is
not
to
lend
--
mr.
morton
hollander
that's
set
forth
on
page
22
of
our
brief
in
quotes
from
section
636
(a)
(2)
of
the
statute.
the
whole
plan
of
the
small
business
administration
act,
of
course,
is
this,
that
to
the
extent
that
the
would-be
borrower
can
get
the
funds
privately
is,
of
course,
encouraged
to
do
so.
in
fact,
the
small
business
administration
has
to
--
has
to
certify
that
a
private
loan
is
not
available
before
the
small
business
administration
act's
authority
can
be
triggered
into
play.
after
a
demonstration
of
nonavailability
of
private
loans
is
made,
then
the
statute
and
that
provision
that
your
honor
is
reading,
points
out
that
the
small
business
administration
shall
try
as
--
a
next
step
to
arrange
for
a
participation
loan
with
the
bank
to
have
the
bank
come
in
at
least
to
share
in
the
making
of
the
loan
to
the
individual
and
failing
that,
then
the
small
business
administration
is
allowed
to
loan
100%.
now,
again
--
mr.
morton
hollander
oh,
this
is
--
mr.
morton
hollander
so
far
as
the
small
business
administration
is
concerned?
oh,
this
is
--
mr.
morton
hollander
insofar
as
the
small
business
administration
program
is
concerned,
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
the
typical
agreement
but
this
is
the
--
the
type
of
agreement
that
right
now,
i
think,
covers
over
$500
million
of
government
funds
disbursed
under
the
small
business
administration
act
in
participational
loans.
i
would
like
--
i
--
i
would
like
to
--
to
point
out
that
there
is
this
one
last
distinction
between
nathanson
and
this
case.
we
filed
a
claim
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
for
$16,000.of
that
$16,000,
$4000
belongs
to
that
bank.
that
$4000,
if
we
collect,
we
turn
over
to
the
bank
or
if
we
collect
the
dividend
on
it,
that
$4000,
we're
not
asking
for
any
priority.
in
connection
with
that
$4000,
we're
not
asking
for
any
priority
at
all.
we
are
asking
and
that's
the
$4000
which
conceivably
comes
within
the
scope
of
the
nathanson
decision.
we
are
asking
for
priority
only
with
respect
to
the
$12,000
representing
the
federal
investment
in
this
loan.
now,
for
the
--
for
the
reasons
that
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
it's
filed
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
now,
for
these
reasons,
we
think
the
court
below
improperly
relied
on
nathanson.
we
think
that
the
district
court
and
the
referees
improperly
relied
on
those
recent
that
i've
been
able
--
unable
to
get
into
and
develop
because
of
the
limited
time
available.
our
arguments
with
respect
to
the
two
other
grounds,
that
is
those
relied
on
by
the
district
court
and
those
relied
on
by
the
referee
are
set
forth
in
our
brief.
and
i,
of
course,
have
to
submit
in
those
arguments
in
the
brief.
but
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
the
brief,
for
those
reasons
i've
tried
to
outline
in
my
arguments
here
today,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
an
error
and
should
be
reversed
with
instructions
to
that
court
to
direct
the
lower
courts
to
recognize
the
federal
priority
under
3466
and
under
the
bankruptcy
act's
provision,
section
64.
mr.
morton
hollander
may
it
please
the
court.
i
--
i
should
like
to
clarify
one
thing
so
far
as
the
sequence
of
events
is
concerned
here.
i
am
not
quite
sure
how
important
it
is
and
what
materiality
it
has.
but
i
did
state
in
my
affirmative
argument
that
the
united
states
treasury
check
for
$15,000
was
advanced.
it
was
sent
to
the
bank.
the
bank
added
50
--
the
bank
$5000,
then
it
made
its
$20,000
loan.
mr.
morton
hollander
oh,
yes.
oh,
yes,
the
--
mr.
morton
hollander
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
the
application
to
the
bank
was
made
on
a
loan
provided
by
the
small
business
administration
that
before
this
small
business
administration
disbursed
its
75%
to
the
bank,
the
borrower,
mr.
barquist
(ph)
was
personally
advised
by
letter
from
the
sba.
mr.
morton
hollander
oh,
yes.
this
is
--
the
--
the
relations
are
made
very
clear.
does
the
sequence
to
that
--
the
fact
that
what
happened
was
that
sba
or
the
treasury
sent
its
$15,000
check,
the
bank
added
$5000
and
then
the
$20,000
loan
was
made,
is
made
very
clear
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
in
this
case.
the
record
at
page
39,
the
district
court's
opinion
says,
"the
facts
are
not
disputed
in
compliance
with
the
agreement.
small
business
administration
paid
over
to
the
bank
the
sum
of
$15,000
by
a
draft
drawn
on
the
treasury."
the
bank
then
loaned
the
money
to
the
bankrupt.
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
on
page
46
says,
"on
november
21,
the
sba
sent
the
bank
the
check
for
$15,000
worth
75%
interest."
the
bank
then
loaned
$20,000
to
barquist
(ph).
the
record
also
shows
that
in
a
memorandum
submitted
by
my
opponent,
the
very
same
sequence
of
events
was
set
forth.
i
--
i
don't
believe
there's
any
question.
the
only
--
on
that
aspect
of
the
case,
the
only
crucial
consideration
is,
did
the
sba
or
did
the
sba
not
disburse
its
interest
in
the
funds
before
bankruptcy?
clearly,
it
did.
it
disbursed
the
funds
in
november
1956.
the
petition
of
bankruptcy
was
filed
the
barquist
(ph)
was
adjudicated
a
bankrupt
late
in
1957.
the
marxen
case
can
have
no
applicability
under
those
circumstances
because
in
the
marxen
case,
the
government's
disbursement,
the
expenditure
of
federal
funds
so
far
as
its
guarantee
of
the
--
the
national
housing
administration
contract
was
concerned
and
the
note
thereunder,
the
federal
disbursement,
the
disbursement
of
federal
funds
in
that
place
did
not
occur
until
sometime
after
the
filing
of
the
petition
of
bankruptcy.
here,
as
i
say,
whatever
investment
the
government
made
occur,
practically
a
full
year
before.
i
would
like
to
touch
on
--
on
the
argument
that
--
that
somehow
the
--
there's
a
--
a
violation
of
the
end
line
principle
of
the
bankruptcy
act
by
allowing
the
bank
to
participate
in
the
federal
government's
priority
to
the
extent
of
25%.
it's
been
suggested
that
this
gives
the
bank
an
undue
preference
over
the
other
general
unsecured
creditors.
but
i
do
submit
that
what
the
united
states
does
with
the
recovery,
it
effects
and
the
interests
of
stimulating
small
business
expansion
is
really
a
matter
of
concern
between
the
united
states
government
and
the
private
party.
there
is
absolutely
no
difference
between
that
arrangement
and
the
arrangement
between
one
creditor
and
the
second
creditor
under
which
the
first
creditor
tells
the
second
creditor,
"well,
i'm
going
to
turnover
to
you
all
of
the
general
dividends
i
get
to
the
distribution
of
the
estate."
that
no
way,
prejudice
is
credit
to
c,
d,
e
and
f.
they
still
get
the
same
as
they
would
have
if
the
first
creditor
had
kept
his
general
dividend
distribution
to
himself
and
he
had
not
turned
it
over
to
the
second
creditor.
whatever
benefits
the
second
creditor
gets,
he
gets
solely
at
the
advantage
of
the
first
creditor,
not
at
the
other
general
unsecured
creditors.
that's
the
--
the
same
situation
in
this
case.
the
general
unsecured
creditors
are
in
no
way
prejudiced.
they
still
get
the
same.
for
those
reasons
and
for
those
that
i
pointed
out
earlier,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
