justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest,
mr.
royce,
with
all
--
what
shall
i
say,
friendly
and
nice
but
when
--
when
you
said
the
united
states
and
then
changed
to
the
small
business
administration,
i
don't
think
that
was
a
slip
of
the
tongue.
i
think
it
is
a
bit
of
unconscious
reason.

frankfurter
but
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
feel
your
seriousness
that's
why
i
made
the
comment.
it
was
what
they
call
--
what
the
modern
call,
the
subconscious,
i
think,
prevailed
there.

all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
in
my
master's
house,
uncle
sam,
there
are
many
managements.
