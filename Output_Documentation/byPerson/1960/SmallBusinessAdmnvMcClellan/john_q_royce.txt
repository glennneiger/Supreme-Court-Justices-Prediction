mr.
john
q.
royce
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
when
mr.
hollander
was
stating
the
facts,
he
said
that
the
sba
sent
a
treasury
check
to
the
roopville
state
bank
in
the
amount
of
$15,000.
and
that
the
bank
added
$5000
and
lent
back
was
$20,000.
that
is
not
an
accurate
statement
of
the
sequence
of
events.
i
believe
--
i
don't
think
mr.
hollander
was
trying
to
confuse
anyone,
but
i
think
that
the
actual
sequence
of
events
is
important,
at
least,
is
material
to
one
of
my
arguments.
actually,
if
you'll
note
from
the
record
on
page
4,
paragraph
2,
the
participation
agreement
provides
that
the
bank
--
that
sba
would
purchase
from
the
bank
75%
of
each
disbursement
made
by
the
bank.
paragraph
4
of
the
participation
agreement
provides
that
the
bank
will
not
cash
the
check
until
bank
has
disbursed
to
the
borrower
the
amount
it
represents
it
will
disburse
to
the
borrower
and
the
bank's
requisition
to
sba
for
such
check.
you'll
note
also
in
the
record
at
page
9
that
the
note
is
dated
november
16,
1956.
the
requisition
to
the
bank
which
is
found
in
the
record
at
page
27,
exhibit
f,
shows
that
the
bank
on
november
26
or
on
november
16
requested
the
funds.
the
check
from
the
sba
to
the
bank
is
dated
november
23rd.
the
sequence
of
events
was
that
the
bank
lent
back
was
$20,000
and
then
the
sba
sent
its
check
to
the
bank
for
$15,000.
i
believe
that
is
material
in
one
of
my
arguments
that
i'll
try
to
point
out
later.
mr.
john
q.
royce
that
would
be
my
understanding
but
that
is
the
way
that
is
supposed
to
be
handled
at
least.
now,
mr.
justice
brennan
inquired
twice
i
believe
yesterday,
what
would
be
the
result
of
a
dividend
on
the
common
unsecured
part
of
this
claim
and
mr.
justice
whittaker
inquired
whether
or
not
the
participation
agreement
from
the
assignment
lost
its
validity.
i
believe
mr.
hollander
correctly
answered
those
questions
that
the
agreement
is
still
operative.
it
has
been
pointed
out
here
today
that
there
has
--
there's
only
one
claim
applied.
the
claim
appears
on
page
2
of
the
record
here.
now
that
is
one
claim
for
16,700
and
some
dollars.
in
paragraph
4,
it
notes
that
the
consideration
is
the
$20,000
note
executed
and
delivered
to
the
bank
and
thereafter,
assigned
to
the
small
business
administration.
you'll
note
on
paragraph
6
that
priority
actually
is
claimed
in
the
claim
for
the
full
$16,000.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
grounds
of
objection
filed
with
the
referee
initially
in
this
case
was
that
the
small
business
administration
didn't
have
that
much
money
coming.
and
mr.
farmer,
who
was
then
united
states
attorney,
said,
"no,
of
course,
that
is
conceded.
we
are
bringing
this
action
for
the
sba
and
the
bank
as
their
interest
may
appear."
we
have
attached
the
--
as
exhibit
a,
the
participation
agreement
and
as
exhibit
b,
the
note.
so
that
it
is
from
those
documents
that
you
determine
what
interests
each
of
them
do
have
in
this
loan.
mr.
john
q.
royce
that
is
what
they
say
now.
mr.
john
q.
royce
yes.
mr.
john
q.
royce
i
don't
believe
so.
we
--
we
accepted
that
at
least
as
a
partial
victory
initially
that
they
were
not
claiming
for
the
entire
$16,000
notwithstanding
their
claim
as
file
said
so.
mr.
john
q.
royce
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
q.
royce
it
has
never
been
amended.
no,
sir.
now,
we
have
three
points.
the
priority
statute
provides
a
priority
for
debts
due
to
the
united
states.
we
contend
that
in
this
case,
there
is
no
debt
due
to
the
united
states
as
such.
that
maybe
a
sort
of
a
robust
position
but
i
believe,
it's
true.
the
basis
of
that
is
that
the
small
business
administration
is
a
separate
entity.
our
second
contention
is
that
even
though
the
--
mr.
john
q.
royce
yes,
sir.
i
--
and
i
--
mr.
john
q.
royce
--
i'll
develop
it
a
little
bit
later.
briefly,
i
--
i
am
dead
serious
--
mr.
john
q.
royce
--
about
it
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
what
the
referee
found
in
this
case.
the
second
one
is
that
even
though
the
sba
is
the
united
states,
then
we
contend
that
there
was
no
debt
due
to
the
sba
at
the
time
of
bankruptcy.
that
is
the
holding
of
this
court
in
the
marxen
case.
our
third
point
is
that
this
court
has
said
that
where
the
allowance
of
the
priority
would
be
plainly
inconsistent
with
other
statutes
and
acts
of
congress,
it
will
not
be
enforced.
we
believe
that
the
priority
here
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
priority
statute
itself
with
the
bankruptcy
act
and
inconsistent
with
the
small
business
act
itself.
now,
i
--
i
will
mention
this
proposition
that
the
small
business
administration
is
not
the
united
states.
i
might
start
that
with
the
proposition
that
the
--
the
government
in
its
brief
says
it
is
now
firmly
established
that
a
non-incorporated
agency
of
the
united
states
must
be
considered
the
--
to
be
the
united
states
for
the
purpose
of
the
priority
statute.
if
that's
true,
then
i
have
no
argument.
this
court,
however,
in
the
--
in
the
marxen
case,
suggested
the
argument
in
connection
with
the
fha
that
the
administrator
had
been
given
the
power
to
sue
and
be
sued
and
--
but
the
question
is
not
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
that
constitutes
the
federal
housing
administration
a
separate
entity.
in
the
remund
case,
united
states
against
remund,
which
involved
the
farm
credit
administration,
the
court
found
that
the
farm
credit
administration
was
the
united
states
but
they
did
it
not
on
the
basis
it
is
not
incorporated
but
on
the
basis
that
it
did
not
bear
any
resemblance
to
the
government
corporations
or
actual
separate
entities.
here,
in
addition
to
the
power
to
sue
and
be
sued
in
any
court
to
handle
its
property
to
adopt
the
seal,
congress
initially
set
up
a
revolving
fund
for
the
small
business
administration.
we
contend
that
the
money
--
that
it
also
provides
that
the
small
business
administration
shall
pay
interest
to
the
treasury
on
the
money
that
it
has
drawn
from
its
revolving
fund.
in
this
case,
if
there
is
a
recovery
by
the
small
business
administration,
the
money
will
not
be
paid
to
the
treasury
of
united
states,
it
--
except
insofar
as
it
is
the
custodian,
the
bank
in
which
small
business
administration
keeps
its
money.
it
does
not
have
to
account
annually
for
the
funds
that
are
drawn.
the
revolving
fund
is
set
up
without
fiscal
year
limitation.
the
small
business
administration
simply
pays
interest
on
the
amount
that
it
has
drawn.
when
this
goes
back
in,
it
will
serve
to
reduce
the
interest
that
small
business
administration
pays
but
it
--
it's
not,
in
fact,
a
payment
to
the
treasury
of
united
states.
that
is
my
argument
on
the
proposition
that
this
is
a
separate
entity.
as
i
say,
i
--
i
recognized
that
if
it
has
to
be
incorporated,
this
one
isn't.
i
submit
that
it
does
have
all
of
the
powers
and
stands
between
the
debtor
and
the
united
states
as
it
is
now
set
up.
now,
my
second
proposition
is
that
there
was
no
debt
due
to
small
--
to
the
small
business
administration
at
the
time
of
bankruptcy.
at
that
time,
the
bank
--
the
bank
was
the
only
payee
on
the
note.
it
still
held
the
note.
the
only
interest
that
small
business
administration
had
was
a
right
to
participate
with
the
bank.
this
is
the
reason
that
i
--
i
think
the
order
in
sequence
of
events
as
to
how
the
loan
was
made.
small
business
administration
had
a
contract
with
the
bank.
it
was
not
a
party
lender
at
all.
it
said,
"bank,
if
you
will
lend
this
man
$20,000,
then
we
will
purchase
from
you
75%
of
it."
the
bank
did
lend
the
money
and
still
held
the
note.
the
debtor
could
not
have
made
a
payment
direct
to
the
united
states
if
he
wanted
to
at
that
time.
the
only
legal
assignment
of
this
note
occurred
subsequent
to
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
mr.
john
q.
royce
yes,
sir.
and
that
is
my
second
point
that
there
was
no
equitable
assignment
of
any
part
of
the
note.
the
small
business
--
or
the
participation
agreement
provides
that
on
written
demand,
the
bank
will
assign
--
will
transfer
the
word
--
the
word
uses
--
used
as
"transfer
without
recourse"
not
assigned.
we'll
transfer
without
recourse
within
five
days
after
written
demand.
now,
an
agreement
to
assign
in
the
future
does
not
constitute
an
equitable
assignment.
an
equitable
assignment
arises
when
there
is
an
intention
immediately
to
assign
but
for
some
reason,
no
--
the
actual
assignment
does
not
occur.
here,
there
was
no
intention
to
make
any
immediate
assignment.
it
was
to
be
made
five
days
after
a
written
demand.
mr.
john
q.
royce
that
is
not
--
mr.
john
q.
royce
not
--
not
my
reasoning,
no,
sir.
i
--
the
small
business
administration
in
its
brief
takes
the
position
the
minute
we
parted
with
our
money,
we
had
an
interest.
i
say,
"no,
you
were
interested
but
you
had
no
legal
interest."
if
you
follow
the
distinction
that
i
make
between
interested
and
interest.
mr.
john
q.
royce
yes,
sir.
now,
that
--
now,
that
is
the
one
that
judge
stanley
took
in
this
case.
mr.
john
q.
royce
well,
that,
as
i
say,
i
think
that
is
my
position
in
connection
with
that
phase
of
this
thing.
now,
i
do
not
agree
with
mr.
hollander
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
only
on
the
basis
of
the
nathanson
case.
that
case
is
similar.
it
is
not
analogous
to
the
situation
here.
in
that
case,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
the
--
none
of
the
money
sought
to
be
recovered
went
to
any
agency
of
the
united
states.
in
this
case,
it
is
true
that
75%
of
the
recovery
incidentally,
that
is
not
an
absolutely
accurate
statement,
75%
of
the
amount
of
the
recovery
by
sba
because
it's
75%
of
the
total
recovery,
if
any
--
any
part
of
the
common
claim
is
allowed
that.
mr.
john
q.
royce
that's
right.
that
would
have
to
be
included
as
a
total
recovery
on
this
note
and
then
the
parties
will
bear
the
loss
"ratively"
in
accordance
with
their
interest.
mr.
john
q.
royce
not
--
no
--
no.
i
have
set
out
in
my
brief.
frankly,
i
think,
the
cost
may
have
gone
up
since
the
original
computation
was
made
but
the
--
just
what
distribution
they
will
get
in
this
case.
now,
my
--
my
proposition
that
the
allowance
of
the
priority
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
priority
statute
is
simply
that.
to
the
extent
of
bank
shares,
the
money
recovers
will
not
be
available
to
sustain
the
public
burdens
or
discharge
the
public
debt,
at
least
a
part
of
it
is
going
to
a
private
party.
now,
it
is
for
that
same
reason
also
inconsistent
with
the
bankruptcy
act.
we
have
a
number
of
cases
saying
that
the
theme
of
the
bankruptcy
act
is
equality
of
distribution
among
creditors
holding
just
demands.
here,
while
the
bank
will
not
recover
$4000,
if
the
priority
is
allowed
in
this
case,
the
bank
will
recover
75%
of
its
debt,
where
the
other
common
creditors
will
receive
not
more
than
2%,
if
they
receive
any.
so
that
the
allowance
of
the
priority
not
only
produces
a
preference
or
a
priority
to
a
common
creditor
without
any
superior
equities
over
any
of
the
other
creditors
but
also
to
the
extent
that
that
money
is
paid
over
to
the
bank,
it
will
not
be
available
to
sustain
the
public
burdens
and
discharge
the
public
debt.
mr.
john
q.
royce
it's
by
a
contract
with
the
small
business
administration.
i'm
careful
not
to
say
--
mr.
john
q.
royce
--
united
states.
it
--
it
gets
it
by
its
private
contract.
now,
the
provision,
the
only
provision
in
the
law,
and
i
do
not
have
the
whole
thing
set
out
in
my
brief,
appears
at
page
19
section
636
(a)
of
the
small
business
act,
15
u.s.c.
section
636
(a)."
the
administration
is
empowered
to
make
loans
of
various
varieties
and
such
loans
maybe
made
or
affected
either
directly
or
in
cooperation
with
banks
or
other
lending
institutions
through
agreements
to
participate
on
an
immediate
or
differed
basis."
that
is
the
--
that's
the
only
language
of
the
statute
which
provides
for
the
participation
between
the
bank
and
small
firm
--
participation
of
small
business
administration
with
banks
and
other
commercial
lending
institutions.
now,
i
also
contend
that
the
allowance
of
the
priority
here
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
small
business
act
itself.
at
page
22
of
my
brief,
commencing
at
that
bottom
of
the
page,
is
section
1
of
the
small
business
act.
it
says,
"the
essence
of
the
american
economic
system
of
private
enterprise
is
free
competition
only
through
full
and
free
competition
can
free
markets,
free
entry
into
business
and
opportunities
for
the
expression
and
growth
of
personal
initiative
and
individual
judgment
be
assured.
the
preservation
and
expansion
of
such
competition
is
basic
not
only
to
the
economic
well-being
but
to
the
security
of
this
nation.
such
security
and
well-being
cannot
be
realized
unless
the
actual
and
potential
capacity
of
small
business
is
encouraged
and
developed.
it
is
the
declared
policy
of
the
congress
that
the
government
should
aid,
counsel,
assist
and
protect
insofar
as
possible
the
interest
of
small
business
concerns
in
order
to
preserve
free
competitive
enterprise
to
ensure
that
a
fair
proportion
of
the
total
purchases
and
contracts
for
property
and
services
for
the
government
including,
but
not
limited
to,
contracts
for
maintenance,
repair
and
construction
be
placed
with
small
business
enterprises
to
ensure
that
a
fair
proportion
of
the
total
sales
of
government
property
be
made
to
such
enterprises
and
to
maintain
and
strengthen
the
overall
economy
of
the
nation."
in
the
united
states
v.
guaranty
trust
company
case,
which
this
court
has
cited
in
or
has
been
apparently
cited
to
this
court,
nearly
every
case
where
the
priority
statute
was
involved,
which
involved
the
transportation
act
of
19
--
1820,
long
in
there.
they
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
strengthen
the
credit
position
of
the
railroads
and
that
allowing
a
priority
would
defeat
that
purpose.
i
believe
the
same
thing
is
--
is
true
here.
your
ordinary
supplier,
materials
and
services,
if
he
knows
that
his
debt
is
going
to
come
after
a
priority
allowed,
the
united
states
is
going
to
curtail
his
credit.
if
the
argument
was
made
in
connection
with
the
fha
and
the
emory
case
and
in
that
case
the
court
said,
"no,
the
purpose
of
the
fha
was
--
was
not
--
was
to
stimulate
the
building
trades."
the
building
trades
would
not
be
embarrassed
by
the
allowance
of
a
priority
against
the
borrower
or
the
homeowner.
in
this
case,
it
is
the
borrower
himself,
whose
credit
we
are
attempting
to
bolster,
the
small
business
organization.
i
believe
that
as
a
matter
of
--
as
a
practical
matter,
we
have
advised
clients
in
our
office
to
be
a
little
weary
of
--
to
extending
very
much
credit
to
people
who
have
these
loans
and
i
say
that
not
--
that
has
been
even
after
this
case
has
arisen,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
i
have
been
successful
in
every
court
by
either
the
appellee
or
the
respondent.
i
still
feel
that
i'm
swimming
upstream.
this
is
not
--
i
--
i
can't
say
that
this
is
the
pure
cut-and-dried
proposition
and
until
this
court
speaks,
we
are
kind
of
warning
our
clients
that
they
might
find
themselves
out
if
there
is
a
small
business
loan.
so
--
this
thing
is
not
just
argument,
it
is
a
practical
matter
i
think
as
--
mr.
john
q.
royce
yes,
sir.
now,
there
was
some
suggestion
yesterday
that,
why
can
we
raise
this
question
of
the
participation
of
the
bank?
i
don't
recall
just
who
it
was
except
--
well,
isn't
that
just
the
side
agreement,
can't
i
agree
to
do
anything
i
want
to
do
with
the
money
i
recover?
my
answer
to
that
is
simply
that
this
is
one
single
claim
by
the
united
states
--
by
the
small
business
administration.
as
their
interest
may
appear,
therefore,
you
must
examine
the
participation
agreement
in
order
to
determine
how
their
interests
do
appear.
first,
you
determine
how
the
--
how
much
has
been
paid,
how
much
each
has
recovered.
but
then,
the
--
it
is
also
necessary
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
priority
is
due
since
it
has
been
claimed.
i
submit
that
you
have
to
examine
the
entire
document,
the
whole
document,
to
determine
how
much
is
going
to
be
available
to
sustain
the
public
burdens
to
discharge
the
public
debt.
mathematically,
the
only
place
where
the
--
everybody
comes
out
even,
where
the
--
all
of
the
laws,
the
bankruptcy
act,
the
priority
statute
and
the
agreement
between
the
bank
and
the
small
business
administration,
the
only
place
that
they
come
out
even
is
that
if
everybody
gets
just
an
ordinary
dividend
without
priority.
the
minute
you
allow
a
priority,
then
the
bank
has
got
to
get
some
of
it
or
there
is
a
violation
of
the
participation
agreement.
mr.
john
q.
royce
i
said,
"i
--
i
realized,
this
is
a
--
a
robust
request."
nevertheless,
i
--
i
really
am
serious
but
i
--
i
--
mr.
john
q.
royce
i
think
there
is
a
--
there
are
two
kinds
of
agents,
burdening
question,
but
--
but
that
the
small
business
administration
is
an
agent.
but
my
contention
is
that
it
deals
with
its
own
funds
to
perform
the
work
of
its
master.
the
farm
credit
administration,
which
this
court
said
was
not
a
separate
agency,
got
an
annual
appropriation.
it
was
all
cleaned
up
at
the
end
of
each
year.
here,
the
master
said
to
the
agent,
"use
my
money
to
perform
your
service."
i
say
that
the
small
business
administration
has
been
given
some
money
and
said,
"now,
use
your
money,
pay
me
interest
on
it."
mr.
john
q.
royce
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that
is
all
of
my
argument.
i
believe
for
all
of
the
various
reasons
stated
that
each
of
the
courts
below
was
correct
and
that
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
