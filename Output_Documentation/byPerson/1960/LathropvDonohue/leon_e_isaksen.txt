mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
a
compulsory
bar
was
not
justified
in
wisconsin
and
it
is
not
existing
as
a
means
of
disciplining
the
members
of
the
bar
or
educating
the
members
of
the
bar.
it
was
not
justified
by
the
supreme
court
and
it's
not
existing
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
public
from
any
incapacity
on
the
part
of
the
members
of
the
bar
or
any
fraud
or
any
deception
or
anything
of
that
kind.
what
the
supreme
court
did
say
in
regard
for
the
justification
for
this
compulsory
bar
was
this,
and
i'm
substantially
quoting,
"the
public
welfare
will
be
promoted
by
securing
and
publicizing
the
composite
judgment
of
the
members
of
the
bar
on
matters
directly
affecting
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
practice
of
law."
it
said
further,
"the
general
public
and
the
legislature
are
entitled
to
know
the
opinions
of
the
majority
of
the
members
of
the
bar."
it
said,
"the
court
has
determined
that
the
public
interest,
that
it
is
in
the
public
interest,
to
have
public
expression
of
the
views
of
a
majority
of
the
members
of
the
bar
on
these
subjects."
and
it
concluded
that,
"the
compulsory
bar
could
do
this
job
much
more
effectively
than
could
a
voluntary
bar."
in
other
words,
if
the
court
please,
this
compulsory
bar
is
existing
and
justified
for
the
express
purpose
by
the
supreme
court
which
created
it,
of
securing
and
publicizing
the
opinions
of
men
on
the
number
of
the
subjects
that
relate
to
the
administration
of
justice
or
the
practice
of
law
or
court
reforms.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
it
does.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
it
does.
yes,
but
subject
to
the
discipline
of
the
supreme
court.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
never
mentioned
it.
these
are
the
reasons
for
the
--
justifying
the
compulsory
feature
--
compulsory
bar.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
it
was
the
same
under
the
voluntary
party,
it
had
the
same
discipline
--
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
--
under
the
voluntary
party.
now,
we
submit,
if
the
court
please,
respectfully
submit
that
our
supreme
court
erred
first
in
this
respect,
that
it
found
that
there
was
invasion
in
fact
of
first
amendment
freedoms
in
this
case.
the
court
said,
"he
is
as
free
as
before
to
express
his
opinions
on
any
subject
in
any
manner
he
wishes."
and
when
it
came
to
the
balancing
of
interest
in
that
part
of
its
opinion,
it
said,
"when
we
attempt
to
balance
the
competing
interest,
we
find
no
interference
with
the
right
of
freedom
of
speech."
now,
in
determining
whether
there
is
an
--
an
interference
in
fact
in
this
case,
we
must
remember
that
the
justified
purpose
and
function
of
this
bar
is
to
make
public
expression
of
the
views
of
the
majority
of
the
bar
to
be
voiced
through
its
board
of
governors.
now,
what
is
the
effect,
if
the
court
please,
on
a
member
of
the
bar
who
wishes
not
to
speak
or
to
remain
silent
or
not
take
a
stand
on
a
bill
before
the
legislature
relating
to
divorce
or
to
retirement
of
judges?
it's
impossible
for
him
not
to
take
a
stand.
the
supreme
court
recognized
in
its
opinion,
that
part
of
the
dues
and
i'm
quoting,
"are
used
to
advocated
causes
to
which
he
is
opposed."
so
the
mere
fact
of
compulsory
membership,
compulsory
payment
of
dues,
one
has
taken
a
stand
whether
he
wishes
to
or
not.
true,
he
has
a
choice
of
remaining
silent
and
not
taking
a
stand
by
resigning
from
the
practice
of
law.
it
was
held
in
one
of
the
jehovah
witness
cases
that
a
tax
or
a
license
fee
cannot
be
exacted
for
exercising
a
freedom
that's
guaranteed
or
freely
given
under
the
constitution.
here,
the
price
of
remailing
--
remaining
silent
--
remaining
silence
is
far
more
than
a
mere
license
fee.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
in
what
way
has
he
come
in
conflict?
no
way
except
that
he
is
--
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
he
is
sued
for
his
dues.
he
paid
his
dues
under
protest,
protesting
that
on
the
very
grounds
we're
setting
forth.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
you
mean
a
particular
issue?
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
on
any
particular
measure?
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
no,
no,
it's
not
a
made
up
case.
it's
--
it's
a
payment
of
dues
under
protest
alleging
that
we
have
to
take
a
stand
--
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
oh,
yes.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
there
--
there
--
there's
a
general
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
they
have
done
so
and
that's
all
we
have
to
allege
under
our
pleadings
and
that's
admitted
under
the
demurrer
that
they
have
done
so
and
the
supreme
court
has
said
so,
that
part
of
the
dues
are
used
for
that
purpose.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
no,
no,
that's
correct.
now,
so
that
in
order
for
this
man
not
to
take
--
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
no,
i
don't
think
it's
claimed
--
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
it's
admitted
that
they
took
positions
contrary
to
his
and
to
which
he
objected,
that's
admitted
in
the
case.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
that's
correct.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
right,
any
number
of
questions
that
relate
to
the
administration
of
justice.
now,
so
that
a
man
does
have
a
choice
of
remaining
silent
or
not
taking
a
stand
by
resigning
from
the
profession,
that's
the
only
way
he
can
refrain
from
taking
a
stand
on
legislation.
the
price
is
too
high.
it
means
his
profession.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
bar
cannot
afford
not
to
take
a
stand.
so
they
have
two
other
choices,
one
is
to
say
nothing
and
as
do
violence
to
the
conscience
or
to
--
to
speak
out
himself,
in
order
to
disassociate
himself
from
the
majority
view.
and
in
order
to
do
that,
he
also
has
to
speak
in
a
louder
voice
so
to
speak,
in
order
to
offset
the
majority
voice
which
has
been
amplified
with
the
dues
that
he's
had
to
pay
to
help
amplify
the
majority
voice.
now,
what
if
the
person
who
wishes
to
speak
on
a
particular
measure?
his
rights
are
impaired
because
his
voice
is
still.
it's
stilled
at
least
to
the
extent
that
his
--
the
effect
of
his
voice
is
minimized
by
the
amplification
of
the
majority
voice,
but
it's
still
by
a
much
more
subtle
force,
we
submit.
this
is
--
a
compulsory
bar
was
created
by
our
highest
court.
it
has
supervision
of
this
bar.
it
retains
supervision
of
this
compulsory
bar.
it
has
--
they
say
as
regard
with
mission
of
lawyers
in
regard
to
the
discipline
of
lawyers,
we
practice
before
that
supreme
court.
now,
his
court
has
said
that
there
shall
be
public
expression
of
the
views
of
the
majority
of
the
bar
through
the
board
of
governors.
inevitably,
the
view
of
the
board
of
governors
tends
to
become
the
official
--
the
official,
the
orthodox
view.
and
inevitably,
the
tendency
would
be
to
avoid
a
view
that
is
unorthodox
that
isn't
in
accordance
with
the
official
body
that's
created
by
the
supreme
court.
if
for
no
other
reason,
then
that
one
would
take
the
attitude
where
there's
no
use.
money,
they've
got
all
the
money.
they're
doing
the
work
on
this
particular
view,
my
voice
is
minimized
and
there
are
other
reasons
why
it
would
be
discouraged.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
the
state
bar
commissioners,
state
court
of
(inaudible)
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
--
separate
arguments.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
they
are
not.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
it
seems
that
is
this
discouraging
of
exercising
one's
first
amendment
freedom
that
is
possibly
the
greatest
evil.
this
court
has
said
many
times
and
once
through,
mr.
chief
justice
hughes
in
the
dejonge
case,
free
discussing
of
ideas
--
it
is
the
free
discussing
of
ideas
that
results
in
change
by
lawful
means.
and
in
the
watkins
case,
the
court
said,
"the
absence
of
the
unorthodox
voice
would
be
symptom
of
grave
illness
in
the
society."
this
compulsory
bar
tends
to
stipple
the
unorthodox,
the
unpopular
view.
and
the
result
of
the
stultifying
conformity
which
in
one
opinion
of
this
court
said
could
be
more
dangerous
in
the
long
run
than
a
foreign
agent.
now,
it
isn't
only
the
voice
of
the
one
who
wishes
to
speak
or
doesn't
wish
to
speak
that
is
still
or
impaired,
but
the
public's
rights
are
impaired.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
no,
they
--
no,
they
are
representatives
and
they
have
their
own
powers.
they're
elected
by
the
members.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
there's
a
referendum,
my
partner
tells
me
that,
it
could
by
referendum.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
i'm
not
familiar
with
that.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
no
--
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
--
one
may
speak
out
and
speak
out
on
the
meetings,
certainly.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
yes,
certainly
--
certainly.
one
may
speak,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
that
is
right.
they
couldn't
do
with
that.
we
also
feel
that
the
public
is
entitled
to
be
free
from
this
majority
voice,
this
amplified
voice
bombarded
on
the
public
and
i
think
that's
the
spirit
of
only
mentioning
in
the
public
utilities
case
versus
pollak
where
they
had
the
programs,
i
believe
was
on
the
transit
system.
here,
we
have
a
situation
if
the
court
please,
where
the
government,
the
judiciary,
forces
opinions,
publicizes
them
with
the
expressed
purpose
of
influencing
legislation
in
the
legislative
branch
of
the
government.
this
court
has
said
time
and
again,
it's
not
the
function
of
government
to
keep
the
citizen
from
falling
into
error.
authority
here,
it
is
said,
is
to
be
controlled
by
public
opinion,
not
public
opinion
by
authority.
and
in
the
watkins
case,
the
very
purpose
of
the
first
amendment
is
to
foreclose
public
authority
from
assuring
a
guardianship
of
the
public
mind.
so
we
feel
that
the
public
is
entitled
to
be
protected
against
this
government
authority
getting
opinions
and
securing
and
publicizing
them.
now,
we
feel
that
the
wisconsin
court
also
erred
in
another
important
aspect
as
a
matter
law,
when
it
said
that
the
public
and
the
legislature
are
entitled
to
know
the
opinions
of
a
majority
of
the
members
of
a
bar.
under
the
decisions
as
we
see
them,
except
under
the
most
extraordinary
circumstances
and
compelling
circumstances
for
government
isn't
least
concerned
with
the
opinions
of
man.
this
court
has
quoted
on
more
than
one
occasion
the
opinions
of
men
are
not
the
object
of
civil
government.
this
has
been
stated
many
ways,
what
a
man
thinks
is
of
no
concern
to
government.
i
think
we
must
let
his
mind
alone.
here,
we
have
a
vehicle
created
for
the
express
purpose
of
obtaining
and
publicize
private
opinions.
and
as
a
condition
precedent
to
practicing
law,
to
earning
a
living,
i
have
to
agree
to
voice
that
opinion
on
matters
of
great
public
concern,
before
i
even
know
the
subject
is
or
how
it's
going
to
affect
me.
it
seems
that
it
has
some
of
the
characteristics
of
the
old
(inaudible).
it
reminds
one
of
the
remonstrances
of
madison
against
taxing
those
who
do
not
believe
for
the
support
of
those
who
do
believe.
it
seems
to
have
some
kinship
with
the
licensing
of
the
press,
the
same
logic.
this
is
a
privilege.
we'll
do
a
better
the
job
for
the
profession
itself.
we'll
do
a
better
job
for
the
public
and
so
on,
the
same
--
the
same
logic.
in
the
konigsberg
case,
this
court
said,
that
is
the
bar
case
to
california,
admission
to
bar
case,
"if
the
license
for
admission
to
the
bar
was
refused
unless
he
answered
questions
relating
to
his
political
philosophy,
then
we
would
be
compelled
to
decide
far-reaching
and
complex
questions
relating
to
freedom
of
speech."
we
think
we've
reached
the
question
in
this
case.
this
is
a
different
type
of
free
speech
case
than
usually
comes
before
the
court,
its
forced
affirmation
as
distinguished
from
merely
a
--
a
suppression
of
expression.
there
are
relatively
few
cases
of
this
type.
we
have
the
flag
salute
case,
where
the
court
said,
it's
a
compulsion
to
state
of
belief.
the
senate
--
it
requires
affirmation
of
a
state
of
mind.
that
was
reversed.
we
have
the
california
tax
exemption
case,
speiser
v.
randall.
we
have
the
konigsberg
case.
we
have
similar
cases
such
as
the
--
the
sweezy
and
the
rumely,
where
it
wasn't
a
belief,
but
stating
some
facts,
those
were
all
reversed.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
your
honor,
we
have
no
objection,
nobody
objects
to
paying
a
fee
and
certainly,
this
fee
is
reasonable
and
submitting
to
the
discipline
and
paying
for
the
discipline
and
the
court
doing
the
usual
things
that
it
can
with
regard
to
the
officers
of
the
court,
but
i
can
think
of
no
case
where
we
have
to
--
where
we
are
forced
to
belong
to
an
association.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
yes.
is
there
anything
for
which
it
could
be
used,
the
money
could
be
used?
now
if
it's
forced?
unless
there
is
a
countervailing
public
interest
that
would
justify
such
a
thing,
but
we
don't
have
that
and
i'm
coming
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
we
know
what
--
we
know
what
the
court
said
in
--
in
--
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
the
court
--
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
the
court
--
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
if
it's
a
forced
organization,
yes.
no
one
has
--
can
compel
me
to
pay
to
support
the
view
on
any
of
those
unless
--
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
that's
right.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
the
only
--
the
only
activity
and
it
is
the
big
activity
and
the
court
says,
it's
the
securing
and
publicizing
of
opinions
to
put
them
before
the
legislature
and
the
public.
that's
--
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
that
a
public
what?
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
i
don't
--
i
wouldn't
--
i
wouldn't
--
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
i
would
--
wouldn't
suppose
that
they
--
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
that's
right.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
that
is
correct.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
that
is
correct.
that's
right.
we
have
had
the
employment
cases.
the
only
cases
that
i
know
of
were
--
we've
gone
into
--
the
court
has
sustained
getting
opinion
and
they're
apparently
on
the
basis
that
it
has
some
relation
to
competency
and
so
on.
now,
what
is
the
--
the
compelling
interest
on
the
part
of
the
state
here
to
justify
this
invasion
into
private
opinion,
this
publicizing
and
securing
a
private
opinion?
there
isn't
in
this
case,
any
claim
of
any
public
evil
or
any
great
public
danger
or
of
any
--
anything
of
that
kind.
there's
no
interference
here
with
the
operation
of
the
government
or
the
functions
of
the
government
or
anything
of
that
kind.
the
only
thing
the
supreme
court
says
is,
it's
for
the
public
good
that
we
have
these
opinions
of
the
lawyers
and
they
be
--
and
--
and
you
pay
and
the
board
of
governors
voice
those
opinions.
that's
all
we
have.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
i
don't
think
they
can
be
attributed
to
the
court,
but
there's
--
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
i
should
say,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
they're
possibly
are
situations
where
the
invasions
of
ones
opinion
are
just
that.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
i
don't
think
so,
because
this
is
the
--
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
i
have
no
--
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
your
--
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
the
court
could
do
it
under
the
--
this
circumstance
of
this
case
because
--
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
i
say
that
--
i
say
that
the
court
has
decided
what
this
organization
is
for.
it
created
the
organization.
this
is
what
is
to
do.
we
have
to
take
the
court's
word
as
to
what
it
is
and
that's
what
it
is
and
we
say
that
is
not
a
compelling
reason,
it's
not
a
justifiable
invasion.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
right.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
that
is
correct.
the
supreme
court
says
so
and
we
say
that
that
is
error
because
it
cannot
be
true
because
we
have
had
to
pay
our
funds
which
are
used
for
the
purpose
of
this
organization,
which
is
to
get
the
opinions
of
the
majority
of
the
bar.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
that
is
--
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
or
--
or
to
the
law,
both
of
them.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
right.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
to
the
treasurer
of
the
bar,
the
association.
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
yes,
sir.
mr.
justice
clark,
we
do
have
a
state
statute
in
wisconsin
256.31,
which
was
enacted
in
1943
and
which
created
the
state
bar
of
wisconsin.
and
--
mr.
leon
e.
isaksen
this
court?
yes,
sir.
in
that
connection
your
honor,
in
1946,
and
all
this
impetus,
all
this
effort
to
create
the
state
bar,
it's
interesting
to
note,
came
from
the
leaders
of
the
voluntary
bar
association
for
the
obvious
reason
that
they
were
having
trouble
and
they
were
ineffectual
and
unable
to
do
and
accomplish
the
aims
and
goals
they
had
set
forth
before
them.
in
1946,
they
came
to
the
court
again
and
asked
that
the
bar
be
integration
--
be
integrated.
they
came
at
that
time
with
some
form
of
petition
signed
by
a
lot
of
lawyers.
the
court
indicated
it
wasn't
interested
in
what
the
lawyers
felt
about
integration
and
it
decided
not
to
integrate
the
bar.
then,
in
1956,
these
bar
leaders
again
petitioned
the
court
to
integrate
it.
this
time,
the
court
said,
"well,
it's
been
tried
in
a
number
of
states.
we'll
try
it
in
wisconsin
for
a
test
period
of
two
years."
at
the
end
of
that
two-year
period,
the
wisconsin
court
reviewed
the
situation
in
a
very
fine
opinion
in
5
wisconsin.
2d
618,
the
wisconsin
court
pointed
out
that
all
of
the
objections
that
had
been
raised
by
integration
had
not
materialized.
none
of
them
had
materialized.
it
pointed
out
that
under
the
two-year
experiment
with
integration
it
had
been
demonstrated
that
the
integrated
bar
had
increased
its
services
to
the
profession
and
had
increased
its
contributions
to
the
administration
of
justice.
it
went
on
to
point
out
the
close
relationship
in
the
judicial
process
between
the
lawyer
and
the
courts,
but
the
courts
depend
upon
the
lawyers
and
their
scholarship
and
their
aid
in
assistance
in
the
functioning
of
the
judicial
process
in
that,
it
is
not
undemocratic
to
require
those
who
are
privileged
to
practice
law
and
are
entrusted
with
the
duty
to
secure
or
protect
the
property,
rights,
and
liberties
of
others
to
become
bound
together
in
a
united
effort
to
increase
their
own
capabilities
to
maintain
the
high-standards
of
the
group
and
to
increase
the
effectiveness
of
their
service
to
the
public.
the
integrated
bar
said
it
has
been
defined
as
a
process
by
which
every
member
of
the
bar
is
given
an
opportunity
to
do
his
share
in
carrying
out
the
public
service
of
the
bar
and
oblige
to
bear
his
portion
of
the
responsibility.
and
it
added,
most
objections
have
centered
round
the
obligation
to
bear
a
portion
of
the
responsibility,
but
in
the
nature
of
things,
every
privilege
has
a
correlative
obligation.
now,
the
counsel
for
the
appellant
here
has
stated
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
that
the
court
justified
or
grounded
the
need
for
integration
on
the
basis
of
the
public
be
entitled
to
the
views
of
the
lawyers
and
legislative
matters.
now,
i
think
that
that
gives
undue
emphasis
to
the
state
and
the
court,
but
the
court
merely
said
in
that
case
was
that
appellant's
argument
as
to
unconstitutionality
is
grounded
upon
the
proposition
that
the
state
bar
expresses
opinions
on
legislative
matters.
and
then
it
went
on
to
say
that
this
was
a
--
this
serve
the
public
purpose,
that
this
was
in
the
public
interest
and
that
the
public
was
entitled
to
know
it
how
these
experts
what
their
opinions
were
on
legislative
matters
within
a
narrow
restricted
field.
