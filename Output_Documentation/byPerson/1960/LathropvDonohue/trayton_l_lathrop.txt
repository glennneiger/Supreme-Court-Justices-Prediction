mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
which
was
entered
on
april
5,
1960.
this
action
involves
the
validity
of
rules
of
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
which
requires
that
persons,
who
practice
law
in
the
state
of
wisconsin,
join,
belong
to
and
support
an
association
of
attorneys
known
as
the
state
bar
of
wisconsin.
rules
were
adopted
in
the
latter
part
of
1956
for
a
temporary
period
of
two
years.
at
the
end
of
1958,
they
were
continued
in
effect,
indefinitely.
this
action
was
commenced
in
june
of
1959
to
recover
from
the
treasurer
of
the
association,
dues
which
were
paid
to
him
under
protest.
it’s
contended
that
the
rules
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
there
was
a
demurrer
to
the
complaint.
the
circuit
court
sustained
the
demurrer
and
dismissed
the
action
without
leave
to
plead
over.
the
--
upon
appeal
to
the
supreme
court,
that
court
held
that
the
rules
do
not
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
circuit
court.
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
is
invoked
under
section
1257
(2)
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
code.
the
appellee
asserts
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
under
said
section
on
the
ground
that
the
rules
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
do
not
constitute
a
statute
under
that
section.
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
over
a
period
of
more
than
75
years
that
the
word
statute,
as
it's
used,
touched
in
the
appellate
jurisdiction
of
this
--
this
court,
covers
all
acts
of
a
legislature
--
legislative
nature
to
which
the
--
the
court
--
which
the
state
gives
its
sanction
and
enforces.
for
example,
it
is
stated
that
a
city
ordinance
constitutes
a
statute,
that
a
rule
of
board
of
regents
of
the
university
governing
the
conduct
of
students
constitutes
a
statute,
that
a
constitutional
provision
constitutes
a
statute.
the
--
the
appellee
asserts
however
that
we
have
only
a
judicial
act
here.
it
is
submitted
what
the
appellee
is
--
is
saying
that
is
because
of
the
nature
of
the
body
which
creates
the
act
that
it
is
judicial
rather
than
the
nature
of
the
act
itself.
we
submit
that
it
is
the
nature
of
the
act
which
controls
legislative
powers
defined
as
the
power
to
make
laws
and
laws
defined
as
the
aggregate
of
those
rules
and
principles
of
conduct
which
the
governing
body
recognizes
as
those
which
are
enforcing
sanctions.
so
it
is
respectfully
submitted
that
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
do
constitute
a
statute.
we
further
state
that
wisconsin
supreme
court
itself,
states
that
they
are
part
of
the
police
power,
is
exercised
pursuant
to
the
police
power
and
they're
exercised
pursuant
to
the
policy
making
functions
of
the
court,
and
not
pursuant
to
a
--
an
adjudicatory
function
of
the
court.
he
was
attended
by
the
--
i
should
say
that
the
argument
is
going
to
be
divided
between
mr.
isaksen
and
myself.
mr.
isaksen,
will
address
himself
to
the
free
speech
question
and
i
will
address
myself
to
the
question
of
freedom
of
association.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
mr.
isaksen
will
address
himself
to
the
free
--
free
speech
question
and
i
will
cover
the
question
of
freedom
of
association,
your
honor.
it
was
intended
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
that
the
integrated
bar
association
be
a
continuation
of
the
previously
existing
voluntary
wisconsin
bar
association.
that
attention
has
been
accomplished.
the
integrated
bar
started
out
with
the
same
general
officers,
the
same
executive
director,
the
same
property,
the
same
files,
the
same
magazine.
the
court
rules
provided
that
the
integrated
association
shall
elect
their
delegates
to
the
american
bar
association
previously
elected
by
the
voluntary
association.
court
rules
provided
that
the
integrated
association
shall
elect
the
members
of
the
state
judicial
council
which
were
previously
elected
by
the
voluntary
association.
the
integrated
--
the
rules
and
bylaws
refer
to
the
integrated
association
as
an
association
over
60
times.
the
integrated
association
performs
substantially
the
same
functions
and
it's
substantially
the
same
manner
as
did
the
voluntary
association
and
as
does
--
does
the
american
bar
association
as
it
is
alleged
in
the
complaint.
complaint
alleges
that
more
than
--
they're
--
one
of
the
main
objects
and
purposes
of
the
integrated
association
have
been
to
promote
law
reform.
complaint
alleges
that
the
association
makes
and
opposes
proposals
for
changes
in
laws
and
constitutional
provisions
as
the
court
systems,
systems
of
selecting
judges,
text
codes,
corporate
codes,
property
laws,
criminal
codes,
laws
among
nations.
and
that
the
association
has
used
its
funds
in
opposition
to
the
adoption
of
legislation
favored
by
the
plaintiff,
contrary
to
the
plaintiff's
convictions
and
beliefs.
the
law
reform
activities
of
the
association
extend
to
the
united
states
congress.
it
had
laws
to
the
state
legislature.
a
special
subcommittee
has
been
created
for
--
for
federal
legislation.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
and
in
the
opinion
below,
took
judicial
notice
of
the
activities
of
the
association
in
the
legislative
field
and
stated
that
in
every
instance,
legislative
measures
advocated
or
opposed,
have
dealt
with
the
administration
of
justice,
court
reform
and
legal
practice.
since
the
court
below
took
judicial
notice
and
went
beyond
the
complaint,
this
court
is
entitled
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
same
facts.
a
certified
copy
of
the
minutes
of
the
board
of
governors
and
of
the
executive
committee
of
the
state
bar
of
wisconsin,
have
been
deposited
with
the
clerk
of
this
court.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
it's
printed
in
the
record,
your
honor,
on
--
rule
--
rule
2,
section
2,
provides
that
--
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
i'm
sorry,
i'm
sorry.
well,
look
down
at
page
8
of
the
record.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
no,
on
page
8
of
the
transcript
of
the
record.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
yes
sir
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
and
there
is
one
--
there
is
a
section
called
enrollment,
which
requires
that
everyone
enroll
and
it
just
--
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
i
beg
you
pardon?
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
alright,
then
on
--
on
page
9,
in
section
4,
states
that
no
individual
other
than
an
enrolled
active
member
of
the
state
bar
shall
practice
law
in
the
state
or
in
anyway,
any
manner
hold
themselves
out
as
authorized
--
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
he's
subject
to
both
the
criminal
penalty
and
i
think
he's
also
subject
to
being
in
contempt
of
court.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
no,
sir.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
i
--
i
do
not
know.
i'm
sorry,
but
i
do
know
that
--
that
i
would
be
very
effectively
stopped
from
exercising
my
ability
to
practice
law.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
yes,
sir.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
your
honor,
it's
stated
in
the
complaint
that
that
i
am
required
by
the
orders
of
the
supreme
court
and
the
--
all
--
all
of
the
truth
--
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
--
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
the
entire
--
the
entire
rules
which
we
were
–
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
your
honor
--
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
following
the
--
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
following
the
court,
the
--
the
system
of
--
of
pleading
into
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
set
forth
the
ultimate
facts
in
this
complaint.
i
have
set
forth
the
fact
that
i've
been
admitted
to
--
to
practice
law
and
now
i
am
required
to
join
this
--
this
association.
and
--
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
it
is
the
compulsory
feature
of
it,
your
honor.
i
am
required
to
join
in
this
--
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
that's
correct.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
it
makes
the
--
the
difference
makes
that
i
will
no
longer
be
able
to
--
to
pursue
the
only
livelihood
for
which
i
have
been
engaged.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
and
that's
alleged
in
the
complaint.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
that's
correct,
except
in
my
own
behalf.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
that's
--
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
that's
correct.
the
--
there
are
specific
illustrations
of
the
activities
of
the
wisconsin
bar
association
and
the
state
--
state
bar
of
wisconsin
integrated
association,
which
appear
in
the
minutes
and
among
these
are
comprehension
--
comprehensive
revision
of
federal
law
relative
to
tax
liens,
family
law
bill
which
among
other
things,
forbids
those
who
were
divorced
and
have
children
from
remarrying
without
permission
of
a
circuit
judge
and
which
makes
it
a
felony
for
attorneys
to
start
actions
for
breach
of
commerce,
appropriation
of
funds
to
a
legislative
counsel,
judicial
salaries,
constitutional
changes
permitting
increase
of
judicial
salaries
during
the
term
of
office,
a
proposal
to
repeal
integration
of
the
bar,
a
proposal
reducing
the
time
for
buying
mechanics
liens,
constitutional
revision
of
the
court
system
--
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
there
was
a
proposal
in
the
--
in
the
--
in
the
wisconsin
legislature
which
was
opposed
by
this
--
by
the
integrated
association.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
these
are
some
of
the
--
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
but
these
are
--
these
are
the
proposals
that
the
bar
have
either
supported
or
opposed.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
now,
your
honor.
i
--
i
would
like
point
out
this
--
this
statement,
whether
i
disagree
or
not,
i
think
is
entirely
irrelevant.
i
belong
for
example,
to
a
church
and
i
like
the
church,
but
the
moment
that
i'm
told
that
i
belong
to
that,
i
have
to
belong
to
the
church
is
when
i
don't
want
to
get
out
of
it
because
i
don't
think
that
the
state
has
any
business
to
tell
me
that
i've
got
to
belong
to
it
or
that
the
state
has
any
business
to
tell
me
that
i
got
to
belong
to
an
association
and
when
the
association
accepts
that
kind
of
relief
from
the
state
then
in
and
of
itself,
the
association
becomes
something
which
i
am
not
attracted
to
and
that
i
don't
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
that's
--
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
--
it's
even
the
--
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
that's
correct,
sir.
another
--
and
one
other
--
one
other
proposal
that
has
concerned
me,
at
the
present
time,
the
bar
of
governors
has
--
has
under
serious
consideration,
a
proposal
for
the
--
establishing
the
missouri
plan
for
selecting
judges
in
the
state
of
wisconsin.
these
are
illustrated
--
proposals
and
they're
not
at
--
at
all
inclusive.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
the
integrated
bar
in
wisconsin
was
established
as
of
the
1st
of
january,
1957.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
north
dakota
in
1921.
the
--
the
integrated
association
uses
its
executive
director
as
the
lobbyist
and
he's
registered
as
a
lobbyist
pursuant
to
wisconsin
statutes
which
require
registration
and
reports
for
personal
contacts
that
are
made
of
committee
hearings.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
this
--
this
is
--
this
is
--
the
statement
that
i
make
here
is
referred
to
in
the
brief,
your
honor,
but
it
--
it
appears
--
it's
some
of
the
matters
that
the
court
of
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
took
judicial
notice.
it
does
not
appear
in
the
complaint
but
as
i
said
before,
when
the
court
below
took
judicial
notice.
in
all
fairness
to
me,
this
court
should
be
able
to
do
so
too
and
i
have
cited
authority
to
the
effect
that
what
this
law
in
fact,
below,
is
also
law
in
fact,
in
this
court.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
yes.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
that's
correct,
except
as
to
the
--
what
the
board
of
governors
are
doing
as
to
establishing
the
missouri
plan
which
appears
only
in
the
--
in
the
last
minutes
of
the
board
of
governors
and
that
has
been
deposited
with
this
court.
it
doesn't
appear
in
--
in
either
of
the
--
of
the
printed
documents,
but
you
do
have
it
in
the
certified
copy
of
the
--
of
the
proceedings
of
the
state
bar
association.
other
activities
of
the
association
include
the
study
in
curricular
--
study
the
--
of
the
teaching
methods
in
curricular
law
schools,
the
promotion
of
programs
for
post-graduate
education
of
lawyers,
interpretation
of
proper
practice
of
law
to
other
professions
and
work
on
a
minimum
fee
schedule.
and
the
association
also
outlines
procedures
for
furnishing
legal
aid
to
the
court,
but
this
--
the
association,
however
itself
does
very
little
work
in
legal
aid.
it
does
--
its
--
its
work
is
in
the
form
of
encouraging
or
insisting
the
--
the
voluntary
associations
which
do
that
work.
in
connection
with
the
interpretation
of
the
proper
scope
of
the
practice
of
law,
the
association
enters
into
formal
agreements
with
various
other
private
associations.
it
has
it
--
they
have
grievance
committees
and
these
--
the
grievance
committees
supplement
the
work
and
activities
of
the
wisconsin
board
of
bar
commissioners,
an
agency
created
by
the
legislature
and
which
had
been
existed
for
many
years
and
it
has
--
it
has
saved
that
agency
only
about
$400
a
year.
the
association
is
engaged
in
a
public
relations
program
to
advance
the
public
acceptance
of
objects
and
purposes
of
the
association.
that
is
alleged
in
the
complaint.
however,
it
does
not
allege,
but
does
appear
form
the
minutes,
that
it
hires
a
public
relations
consultant
and
that
when
it
felt
that
publicity
should
be
given
to
show
the
good
work
of
the
association
in
securing
the
voluntary
surrender
of
licenses
of
attorneys,
the
committee
--
the
public
relations
man
was
consulted
in
a
meeting
of
the
executive
committee
to
determine
how
press
releases
should
be
handled.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
no,
sir.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
$15
a
year.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
the
supreme
court
is
the
creator
of
it
or
is
the
--
is
the
body
that
--
that
caused
it
come
into
existence.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
i
--
i
believe
there
is
a
report
that
goes
to
the
supreme
court
at
the
end
of
each
year.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
i
have
a
--
i
have
a
copy
of
the
--
attached
to
the
jurisdictional
statement
of
the
budget
of
the
--
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
--
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
expenditures
which
were
--
i
believe
were
reported
to
the
supreme
court.
it'll
appear
at
the
last
page
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
i
do
--
i
--
i
believe
that's
so
but
i
--
i
cannot
say
it.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
no.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
it's
a
matter
--
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
it's
a
matter
of
a
--
of
the
association
making
that
report
and
maybe
that
the
rules
require,
but
i
--
i
do
not
think
that's
so.
integration
in
wisconsin
is
part
of
a
national
law
reform
movement.
it
has
been
fostered
and
guided
by
the
american
judicature
society.
this,
we
believe,
clearly
appears
from
the
--
the
amicus
curiae
brief
filed
by
this
society
and
i
should
like
to
read
from
pages
3
to
4,
a
paragraph
on
--
from
their
brief.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
american
--
american
judicature
society
brief.
pages
3
to
4
states
at
the
bottom
of
page
3,
"from
the
outset,
it
was
a
main
line
of
policy
that
the
society
would
work
chiefly
in
and
through
the
organized
bar
for
the
achievement
of
specific
judicial
reform
projects.
this
was
for
the
sound
and
sensible
reason
that
people
everywhere
tend
to
be
suspicious
of
outsiders
coming
in
and
telling
them
what
to
do.
the
burden
of
lobbying
and
campaigning
must
always
be
carried
on
by
local
residents
of
the
state
or
community"
and
then
skipping
a
sentence,
"this
meant
that
the
correction
of
the
weakness
and
deficiencies
of
the
bar
would
necessarily
be
a
prerequisite
to
any
substantial
accomplishment
and
judicial
selection,
court
organization
procedure
or
other
reform
areas."
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
we
have
county
bar
associations.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
yes,
they
do.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
yes.
that
is
not
in
the
record,
your
honor,
and
it
may
or
may
not
be.
i
--
i
couldn't
say
it.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
yes.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
well,
i
can
say
this
that
there
is
an
undertaking
by
this
--
by
the
state
association
to
get
the
--
the
county
associations
to
channel
all
of
their
proposals
into
the
state
association
and
they
work
from
there,
so
as
to
present
one
--
one
front.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
i
beg
your
pardon?
--
i'm
not
saying
there's
anything
wrong
with
it
except
that
i
don't
feel
that
i
should
be
compelled
to
support
it,
that's
--
that's
the
question.
and
some
other
things
if
they
do
--
do
like,
i
do
not
agree
with,
but
that's
--
the
main
question
is
whether
or
not,
a
person
should
be
compelled
to
support
an
association.
in
1946,
the
wisconsin
court
held
that
integration
could
not
be
established
for
the
purpose
of
conducting
propaganda
in
defense
of
a
legal
profession
or
maintaining
a
legislative
agent.
in
1958,
the
court
specifically
overruled
the
1946
opinion.
and
wisconsin
court
in
the
opinion
below
adopted
the
view
of
the
florida
court,
that
the
public
welfare
will
be
promoted
by
securing
and
publicizing
the
composite
judgment
of
attorneys
on
matters
affecting
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
practice
of
law.
the
--
florida
court
had
held
that
discipline
is
not
the
reason
for
creating
the
integrated
bar
associations.
it
is
submitted
that
the
integrated
bar
association
in
wisconsin
is
a
political
party.
a
political
party
is
an
association
of
men
who
are
desirous
of
carrying
out
a
certain
line
of
public
policy,
to
have
that
policy
enacted
in
the
law.
many
times,
a
political
party
accomplishes
this
end
by
advancing
and
supporting
candidates,
but
the
objects
of
the
party
can
be
obtained
just
as
well
by
influencing
those
persons
who
are
already
in
office.
also,
the
ends
of
the
party
can
be
achieved
simply
by
creating
a
climate
of
public
opinion
in
favor
of
the
party's
principles.
this
court
has
held
on
many
occasions
that
freedom
of
association
is
guaranteed
by
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
it
has
held
that
the
right
of
freedom
association
is
a
right
of
freedom
of
movement.
it
has
held
that
the
state
cannot
select
its
lawyers
in
such
a
way
as
to
impinge
upon
freedom
of
political
expression
or
association.
however,
the
court
below
refused
to
recognize
that
there
is
a
freedom
not
to
join
an
association.
it
said
that
it
is
merely
cliche
to
say
that
the
freedom
to
associate
includes
the
freedom
not
to
associate.
we
submit
that
there
cannot
be
a
right
to
join
an
association,
unless
there
is
a
right
not
to
join
an
association.
otherwise,
we
are
translating
our
rights
into
requirements.
the
framers
of
the
united
nations
declaration
of
human
rights
did
not
regard
freedom
not
to
associate
as
mere
cliche.
they
specifically
provided
that
no
one
may
be
compelled
to
belong
to
an
association.
this
declaration
which
was
made
at
the
end
of
world
war
ii
is
highly
significant
and
should
not
be
lightly
disregarded.
in
italy,
for
example,
in
order
for
a
man
to
go
into
business
or
to
engage
in
farming
or
obtain
employment
or
engage
in
his
profession,
he
was
required
to
either
pay
dues
to
or
belong
to
his
own
syndicate
and
the
syndicates
were
both
political
and
economic.
this
was
the
corporate
statement.
we
submit
that
the
history
of
our
constitution
and
of
our
country,
shows
that
the
freedom
not
to
join
an
association
is
a
basic
liberty
guaranteed
by
the
due
process
clauses
and
as
well
as
the
first
amendment.
just
before
the
american
declaration
of
independence
in
1776,
a
french
liberal
minister
turgut,
prevailed
upon
louis
xvi
to
free
the
french
from
the
compulsory
guild
system.
we
believe
that
madison
had
in
mind,
the
european
compulsory
associations,
when
he
wrote
that
a
free
government
is
not
a
just
government
for
arbitrary
restrictions,
exemptions
and
monopolies
denied
to
part
of
its
citizens,
the
free
use
of
their
faculties
of
which
violates
the
property
that
individuals
have
in
their
opinions
or
which
invades
the
conscience
of
individuals.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
yes,
i
do.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
i
--
i
suspect,
your
honor
that
that's
--
that's
what
we're
going
to
be
led
to.
it
will
be
--
first
will
be
the
--
first,
it
will
be
the
accountants'
association
and
then
it
would
be
the
--
the
doctors
and
the
dentists
and
then
of
the
beekeepers
and
those
to
hold
taxi
cab
licenses
and
all
the
way
up
and
down
the
line.
i
think
that's
what
we're
--
what
we're
headed
for.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
yes.
i
--
i
think
when
we've
taken
this
step
here,
we've
already
done
it.
now,
for
example,
we
already
have
an
integrated
dental
association
in
oklahoma.
not
only
that,
but
other
states
have
used
other
types
of
coercion
perhaps
in
to
cause
people
to
join
associations
instead
of
an
outright
statements
you
have
to
join,
they
give
governmental
powers
to
the
association
and
the
--
and
that
members
of
the
profession
who
do
not
belong
or
do
not
want
to
belong
are
in
fact
coerced
to
belong
for
their
own
protection.
in
south
dakota,
the
state
nurses
examining
board
is
appointed
from
list
of
names
submitted
by
the
state
--
by
south
dakota
state
nurses
association.
also
in
south
dakota,
the
board
of
funeral
directors
is
required
to
be
selected
from
a
list
of
candidates
nominated
by
the
embalmers
and
funeral
home
directors
association.
the
appointment
of
board
of
dental
examiners
is
from
the
north
carolina
dental
society.
also,
in
north
carolina,
four
of
the
nine
members
of
the
board
of
health
are
elected
by
the
medical
society.
also
in
alabama,
the
medical
association
has
constituted
the
state
board
of
health.
we're
already
a
long
way.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
your
honor,
i
think
that
they
were
made
compulsory
by
the
mere
fact
that
the
--
that
the
governmental
power
is
given
to
these
associations,
but
those
are
on
the
outside
in
effect,
have
to
come
in
for
their
own
protection.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
alright.
i
understand
--
i
understand
it
isn't,
but
if
you
give
--
if
you
give
a
--
a
board,
disciplinary
powers
and
you
say
that
that
board
is
to
be
elected
by
an
association,
the
natural
result
is
that
the
--
the
association
has
a
tendency
to
--
to
protect
their
own
members,
but
those
who
are
on
the
outside
are
not
so
likely
to
receive
the
protection.
if
with
this
--
let's
basically
refer
to
the
--
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
i
understand
that,
but
i
--
we
were
talking
about
how
this
is
leading
to
where
we're
--
where
we're
going.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
yes.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
no.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
they're
not
integrated,
i'm
--
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
well,
i
can't
make
that
broad
statement,
your
honor.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
alright.
and
again,
emphasizing
the
--
the
freedom
of
association
which
was
existing
in
this
country,
refer
again
to
tocqueville
and
his
work
on
observation
of
democracy
in
america.
in
the
first
part
of
the
19th
century,
he
stated
that
freedom
of
association
is
one
of
the
most
fundamental
rights
and
that
no
legislature
can
attack
it,
but
on
impairing
the
foundations
of
society.
and
in
america,
he
said
that
no
one
abjures
the
exercise
of
his
reason
and
his
free
will.
now,
in
view
of
these
things
that
i've
just
stated,
i
think
that
one
can
now
wonder
whether
or
not,
that
isn't
what
we're
coming
to.
the
--
the
compulsory
association
idea
has
been
referred
to
as
a
matter
of
--
of
group
self-government
by
the
appellee.
perhaps,
the
word
group
could
better
be
left
out
of
it
and
as
a
matter
--
i
meant
the
word,
itself,
could
be
left
out
so
it's
just
a
matter
of
group
government,
because
for
example,
in
--
in
missouri,
the
group
government
ideas
brought
about
a
constitutional
revision
giving
the
bar
association
equal
rights
with
the
governor
in
the
appointment
of
judges.
and
it's
also
shown
in
the
national
scene
where
the
american
bar
association
is
seeking
to
obtain
as
a
matter
of
regular
course
of
procedure
that
the
executive
refer
all
proposals
for
the
appointment
of
judiciary
to
the
american
bar
association.
and
in
view
of
these
precedents
in
the
case
of
lawyers,
i
say
it's
a
small
wonder
that
the
group
self-government
proposals
and
--
and
enactments
which
were
involved
in
the
schechter
poultry
case
and
in
the
carter
coal
case
were
enacted.
so
--
so
small
wonder
that
we
have
the
compulsory
features
that
appear
in
the
railway
labor
act.
and
in
the
carter
case,
the
majority
of
the
court
held
without
disagreement
of
the
minority
on
this
point
with
the
--
also
with
the
concurrence
of
chief
justice
hughes
that,
"to
permit
a
group,
to
make
rules
according
to
their
own
views
of
expediency
so
as
to
bind
or
disagree
minority,
violates
the
guarantees
of
liberty
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin,
when
it
decided
to
integrate
the
bar,
adopted
a
group
of
bylaws
and
rules
and
then
it
said
in
a
later
opinion
that
if
you
--
if
the
bar
association
stays
within
these
rules
and
bylaws,
you're
--
you're
free
and
independent,
you
can
do
what
you
want.
now,
that's
the
connection.
they
created
it.
they
said,
"you
got
to
belong,
but
when
you're
within
these
rules,
you're
--
the
--
the
association
is
free
and
independent."
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
yes,
sir.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
it
--
it
stated
that
that
was
the
way
that
it
was
--
it
was
promulgating
that,
that's
correct,
under
its
inherent
power.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
yes,
sir.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
yes,
sir.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
because
the
annual
license
of
the
--
such
as
the
medical
of
--
medical
man's
license
is
paid
to
the
state
treasury
and
it
is
used
to
pay
representatives
of
the
whole
people
appointed
by
the
governor
or
the
legislature,
whatever
it
is,
to
regulate
the
profession.
in
our
case,
the
dues
are
--
are
paid
to
an
association
which
is
--
has
not
appointed
as
so-called
by
the
--
by
the
governor,
but
it's
this
--
the
association
itself
that
decides
what
laws
it's
going
to
propose
to
--
to
--
or
--
or
oppose
and
it's
the
association
itself
that
has
the
grievance
committees
and
so
on.
this
is
--
in
other
words,
the
difference
is,
in
the
one
case
and
i
think
this
is
a
very
vital
difference,
in
the
one
case,
you've
got
government
by
representatives
of
the
people
as
a
whole,
in
the
other
case,
you've
got
group
or
class
government.
there's
a
very
real
distinction
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not,
we're
going
to
have
that
kind
of
government
in
this
country.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
my
view
is
that
the
integrated
bar
under
the
first
amendment
--
that
the
bar
association
under
the
first
amendment,
should
be
able
to
--
to
take
any
position
it
wants
with
respect
to
legislation
or
--
or
candidates
or
whatever.
the
association
under
the
first
amendment
should
be
able
to
do
any
of
those
things.
the
court
should
not
be
able
to
come
in
and
tell
it
that
it
can't
do
any
of
those
things.
my
view
is
however,
from
the
other
end,
that
the
state
or
the
court
cannot
tell
me
to
support
the
association.
the
association
itself
can
do
what
it
wants,
but
it
cannot
support
--
cannot
compel
me
to
support
the
association.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
not
to
the
association,
your
honor
and
pay
it
to
the
state
to
be
administered
by
the
representatives
of
the
whole
people.
i
think
that's
a
very
vital
distinction.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
no,
sir.
i
do
not
believe
it
could.
my
time
is
about
up,
i
want
to
comment
on
--
on
the
hanson
case
before
i
leave
that
is
relied
on
continuously
throughout
the
brief
of
the
--
of
the
appellee.
one
construction
of
the
hanson
case
maybe
that
the
court
believed
that
freedom
of
association
would
be
infringed
in
that
case,
when
the
government
coerces
an
individual
to
support
an
association,
but
that
the
court
was
of
the
opinion
that
it
was
required
to
waive
the
government
interest
in
keeping
open
the
channels
in
the
arteries
of
interstate
commerce
as
against
the
individual
interest
of
freedom.
and
that
in
that
case,
the
court
struck
the
balance
in
favor
of
the
governmental
interest.
if
that
is
the
case,
the
hanson
case
cannot
be
a
precedent
in
a
different
kind
of
case
where
we
are
weighing
different
interest
as
against
different
facts
or
cannot
even
be
a
precedent
even
under
the
same
statute
where
you
have
--
weigh
different
facts.
so
we
submit
that
the
hanson
case
cannot
be
considered
as
a
precedent
in
this
case.
however,
if
the
court
does
deem
the
hanson
case
to
be
a
precedent,
we
submit
that
there
was
an
error
in
that
case,
a
very
serious
error
in
that
the
court
did
not
determine
whether
or
not,
the
interest
of
the
government
in
keeping
open
the
--
the
arteries
of
commerce
was
so
great
and
so
compelling
as
to
be
what
this
court
has
called
the
compelling
subordinating
interest
which
required
the
invasion
of
the
right
of
freedom
of
association.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
well,
your
honor,
you
may
have
decided
it,
but
it
--
it
does
not
appear
from
the
opinion
and
it's
--
it's
a
matter
of
a
state
--
it
appears
that
it
was
left
largely
up
to
congress
to
make
that
determination
as
to
--
as
to
how
the
interest
should
be
weighed.
the
court
itself
did
not
appear
to
do
it.
it
says,
"congress
has
so
determined,"
and
this
is
within
the
--
the
function
of
congress
and
the
court
did
not
make
the
determination.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
you
honor,
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
well
--
well,
your
honor,
the
--
the
wisconsin
court
was
familiar
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
requiring
that
there'd
be
a
determination
of
compelling
interest.
and
the
wisconsin
court
did
not
make
such
a
determination
and
i
am
--
i
am
lead
to
believe
that
the
wisconsin
court
did
not
feel
that
it
could
say
that
there
was
such
a
compelling
interest
on
the
part
of
the
state
which
would
require
attorneys
to
belong
to
this
association.
mr.
trayton
l.
lathrop
it
merely
attempted
to
weigh
it
as
it
appears
that
it
was
done
in
the
hanson
case,
merely
saying,
"well,
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
valid
government
interest
and
we're
just
going
to
--
to
sustain
it."
it
did
not
attempt
to
see
whether
there
was
such
a
compelling
interest
as
this
court
has
required.
