justice
william
o.
douglas
in
what
way
is
the
--
the
petitioner
come
in
conflict
with
the
integrated
bar?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
then
we
don't
have
a
case
of
controversy
here.
justice
william
o.
douglas
then
we
don't
have
a
case
of
controversy.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
but
in
what
way
has
his
--
you're
talking
about
his
ideology
and
the
bar's
ideology,
but
you
haven't
shown
so
far
unless
i've
missed
something,
what
the
conflict
was.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
is
there
any
--
has
there
been
any
conflict
or
is
this
just
a
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
a
made
up
case
there
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
know
but
is
he
--
has
--
has
the
bar
taken
--
been
taking
a
position
on
issues
that
he
disagrees
with?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
are
those
issues?
they
don't
--
i
don't
find
them.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
we
don't
know
what
those
issues
are.
justice
william
o.
douglas
when
--
when
the
union
--
labor
union
case
was
under
argument
a
little
while
ago,
one
of
the
lawyers
for
the
protesting
member,
i
think
stated
that
--
conceded
that
use
of
the
funds
for
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
was
legitimate
as
the
use
of
the
funds
for
other
purposes
what
--
whatever
he
called,
political
purposes
in
that
complaint,
they
were
objected
to.
can
you
think
in
this
case
of
any
legitimate
use
of
the
integrated
barâ€™s
funds
for
any
project?
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
well
that
--
that
that's
belonging.
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
i'm
talking
about
your
point
of
freedom
of
speech.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
of
course
we
don't
know
under
this
complaint
what
these
--
what
the
controversies
are
between
the
bar
and
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
we
don't
know,
are
they,
for
example,
the
--
whether
wisconsin
should
--
should
adopt
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure?
whether
wisconsin
should
adopt
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure?
justice
william
o.
douglas
whether
wisconsin
should
adopt
a
public
defender
system?
justice
william
o.
douglas
are
those
all
illegitimate
activities?
justice
william
o.
douglas
there
--
there
is
no
--
not
in
this
case,
there's
no
even
small
circle
of
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
activities
that
