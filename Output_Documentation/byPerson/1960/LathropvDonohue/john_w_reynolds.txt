mr.
john
w.
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
in
the
next
few
moments,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
issue
of
the
--
whether
or
not
the
regulations
of
the
court
to
the
integrated
bar
and
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
believe
that
the
regulation
is
reasonable.
the
points
i
would
like
to
discuss
at
the
authority
of
the
court
and
briefly,
i
don't
know
if
we
have
that
in
throughout
the
history
of
the
--
this
integrated
bar
in
wisconsin
and
the
record.
the
integration
of
the
state
bar
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
we
believe
is
a
reasonable
method
of
regulating
the
practice
of
the
law.
i
think
that
it
is
quite
clear
from
the
pronouncements
of
this
court
and
on
the
history
of
jurisprudence
that
the
courts
have
an
obligation
to
control
the
practice
of
law.
in
england,
they
did
it
through
the
courts,
didn't
do
it
but
the
ends
of
court
did
it,
and
this
court
in
several
cases
has
been
pointed
out
such
as
in
the
thread
case
by
justice
frankfurter,
the
court's
control
over
a
lawyer's
professional
life
derives
from
his
relation
to
the
responsibilities
of
the
court.
in
our
briefs,
we
have
cited
several
other
authorities
for
this.
this
has
been
recognized
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
in
our
four
integration
cases
where
the
supreme
court
of
our
state
has
indicated
that
they
have
a
--
they
have
a
responsibility
to
the
practice
of
law.
the
--
in
addition
to
that,
our
state
legislature
passed
the
law
section
256.30
which
stated
as
a
misdemeanor
can
practice
law
without
a
license
and
furthermore
that
you
could
be
held
in
contempt
of
court
can
practice
law
without
a
license
which
infer
--
which
indicates
the
legislature
recognized
the
inherent
power
of
the
court
to
control
the
practice
of
law.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
that
law
is
enforced
at
present
time.
i
think
that
of
course
it's
not
only
based
on
historical
precedent
but
it's
based
upon
practical
necessity.
it
starts
out
with
the
practice
of
law
when
you
are
admitted
to
the
bar,
and
you
are
given
a
monopoly
over
a
certain
field
of
activity
and
this
monopoly,
like
all
monopolies,
i
believe,
have
to
regulated
or
at
least
to
this
public
has
to
be
protected
from
the
abuse
of
the
people
who
control
the
monopoly.
the
court
in
wisconsin
felt
that
it
was
very
important
that
the
bar
association,
or
the
lawyers
of
the
state
be
conscious
of
their
responsibility
to
the
court
in
the
administration
of
justice
and
to
society.
in
other
words,
that
we
rise
above
mediocrity
and
the
history
of
the
integrated
bar
in
wisconsin
i
think
indicates
that
this
is
a
reasonable
approach
and
it
has
not
been
something
that's
rash.
now
i'd
like
to
just
quickly
go
through
the
history.
in
1935,
the
state
legislature
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
passed
a
law
authorizing
the
court
to
establish
the
integrated
bar.
this
law
was
vetoed
by
the
acting
governor
at
the
time.
in
1943,
the
state
legislature,
that
is
the
people
of
wisconsin
through
their
legislature,
passed
another
law
and
directing
the
court
to
integrate
the
bar.
and
to
the
end,
and
i
quote
from
the
statute
“that
such
association
shall
promote
the
public
interest
by
maintaining
high
standards
of
conduct
in
the
legal
profession
and
by
aiding
in
the
efficient
administration
of
justice”.
in
other
words,
the
people
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
were
literally
crying
out
to
their
court,
"why
don't
you
supervise
these
lawyers?"
and
the
leading
members
of
the
bar
also
cried
out
to
the
court
for
that
and
their
cries
fell
fortunately
on
deaf
ears.
in
1946,
the
court
again
refused
to
integrate
the
bar
and
on
the
theory
to
quote
them,
that
the
price
and
i
quote
is
the
46
decision,
the
phrase
of
integration
that
is
supervision
or
policing
by
the
court
by
the
activities
of
lawyers
and
it
would
be
much
greater
than
the
court
or
any
lawyer
ought
to
be
willing
to
pay.
that
was
the
logic
of
the
46
decision.
in
my
judgment,
i
think
the
court
misconceived
its
role
because
actually,
the
fact
that
you
have
a
laissez-faire
system
doesn't
mean
that
you
necessarily
have
--
have
freedom.
i
think
the
court
has
an
obligation
and
they
seem
to
recognize
that
to
prevent
things
from
happening.
in
1956,
the
court
ordered
the
integration
of
the
bar
on
the
theory
that
they
are
--
that
the
lawyers
are
entitled
to
the
supervision
and
control
of
the
court.
this
court
here
sitting
here
today
admitted
a
group
of
lawyers
to
the
bar
of
the
united
states
supreme
court,
you
did
this
on
the
assumption
that
the
states
are
assuming
their
responsibilities
to
supervise
these
lawyers.
they
see
to
it
the
lawyers
are
following
the
--
the
ethics
of
the
profession
by
carrying
out
their
duties.
i
think
that
the
record
in
this
case
in
the
case
that
there
have
been
no
violations
of
any
of
the
freedoms
of
the
appellant
is,
and
there
has
been
no
violation
of
his
freedom
of
speech
or
his
freedom
of
association.
the
appellant
as
my
colleague,
mr.
sinykin
pointed
out
the
appellant
when
he
became
a
lawyer,
he
joined
the
bar
of
the
court.
and
the
integrated
bar
is
merely
a
mechanism
for
the
court
to
supervise
its
own
bar.
and
it's
up
to
the
state
to
determine
which
method
of
supervision,
granting
they
have
the
authority
to
supervise
it
and
it's
reasonable
as
to
which
method
they
--
they
should
use.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
the
--
the
state
i
believe
that
--
yes.
i
think
the
same
thing
could
be
said.
in
other
words,
the
--
the
court
is
still
having
integrated
bar
could
have
very
easily
said
we
will
set
up
a
commission
and
the
commission
will
police
the
activities.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
it
is
my
opinion
that
this
could
only
be
done
provided
that
there
is
a
state
agency
that
represents
the
whole
state
or
society
at
large
such
as
the
court
or
some
other
agency
appointed
by
the
governor
to
supervise
the
--
say
the
integrated
medical
profession.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
well,
i
think
that
the
problem
that
justice
black
is
referring
to
is
the
unlawful
delegation
of
authority,
in
other
words,
if
you
don't
have
a
state
agency,
if
you
--
i
don't
believe
you
can
delegate
governmental
authorities
to
a
completely
private
agency.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
and
just
--
and
say
that
all
the
men,
all
doctors
have
to
run
the
associate
--
medical
association
without
any
control
by
the
state
itself.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
that's
a
--
that's
substantially
--
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
i
don't
think
it
presents
a
constitutional
problem.
the
question
is
wise
policy
but
i
think
their
association
is
different
that
you're
dealing
with
officers
of
the
court
to
start
out
with.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
well,
i
think
it's
a
--
it's
done
for
the
purpose
of
improving
the
administration
of
justice.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
i
would
--
i
don't
think
so.
in
other
words,
i
think
if
you
took
the
medical
society
and
have
an
interfering
medical
society
and
they
want
to
express
their
views
on
health
problem,
there's
no
reason
why
they
couldn't
express
their
views.
at
the
same
time,
we're
going
to
keep
in
mind
they
were
not
the
same
as
the
minority
in
that
association
could
not
express
its
views
too.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
there
was
no
one
that
was
being
silenced
by
the
integrated
bar
or
by
this
method
of
regulation.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
well,
that's
a
hypothetical
question.
it
is
in
this
case
--
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
he
hasn't
named
what
he
is
against
though
on
the
record.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
on
the
record
of
this
case,
he
hasn't
complained
of
any
--
of
any
--
he
hasn't
named
any
act
that
he's
against.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
no,
no.
there
has
been
a
great
--
on
the
record
in
this
case
--
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
well,
i
want
to
point
that
out
but
i
want
to
answer
your
question.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
well,
i
want
to
point
it
out.
but
i
also
wish
to
answer
the
question.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
in
the
sense
--
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
well,
in
the
record
of
this
case,
the
complainant,
the
petitioner
has
never
complained
of
a
single
act.
he's
never
named
the
act
of
the
state
bar.
he
has
never
availed
himself
of
his
remedies,
your
honor,
to
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
and
say,
your
honors,
the
bar
is
violating
the
law
of
the
state
by
its
activities.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
no.
or
that
is
the
--
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
well,
the
--
the
constitution
in
wisconsin
is
substantially
the
same
as
the
constitution
of
united
states.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
but
as
to
the
question
of
using
the
fees
which
are
licensed
fees
in
the
same
category,
this
i
believe
goes
on
everyday.
we
have
a
judicial
counsel
in
madison,
wisconsin
and
they
make
recommendations
to
legislature.
our
conservation
department
--
we
--
we
collect
money
from
every
--
fees
from
every
county
in
wisconsin,
there
were
500,000
of
them
and
we
take
those
fees
the
conservation
department
does
--
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
that's
the
government.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
but
this
your
honor
is
the
government
too.
the
state
bar
is
a
state
agency.
that's
why
i'm
here
as
their
--
as
the
attorney
general
defending
them.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
well,
if
he
belongs
to
the
association
before
it's
integrated.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
but
this
here
is
--
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
but
your
honor,
to
be
in
the
real
estate
business
in
wisconsin,
you
have
to
license
for
the
real
estate
board.
the
board
itself
uses
those
fees
to
present
its
points
of
view
to
the
legislature
before
--
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
but
i
think
it's
the
--
it's
the
normal
way
of
operating
or
regulating
trades
in
our
society.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
by
act
of
the
legislature.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
they're
appointed
by
the
governor.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
the
realtors
have
the
real
--
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
it's
a
governmental
agency
but
our
position
is
that
the
state
bar
of
wisconsin
is
just
as
much
a
governmental
agency.
is
that
an
example
--
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
yes.
mr.
john
w.
reynolds
no,
the
officer
of
the
court.
he
has,
of
course,
certain
powers
that
were
given
by
the
court.
thank
you
very
much.
