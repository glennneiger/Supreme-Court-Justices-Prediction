mr.
lathrop.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
isaksen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
it
have
any
disciplinary
powers
at
all
--?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
does.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
the
court
merely
said
that
wasn't
the
--
the
burden
of
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
state
bar
conduct
the
examinations
for
lawyers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
are
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
are
they
a
part
of
the
--
of
--
of
this
organization?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
are
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
isaksen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
the
matter
could
be
here
anyway?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you,
next
to
the
argument
that
you
made,
you
probably
going
to
jurisdictional
argument,
what
issues
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
to
speak,
he
have
the
lawyers
or
pay
for
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
with
respect
of
controlling
what
they
say
and
do
and
that
then
the
limits
of
that
charter
that
he
spoke
of
as
i
understood
the
counsel
to
the
supreme
court
made
in
the
charter
stating
what
the
--
the
jurisdiction
was.
now,
if
they
stay
within
that
jurisdiction,
he's
representing
the
opinions
of
the
public,
matters
of
the
quasi
political
let
us
say,
the
supreme
court
deserve
the
right
to
strike
that
down
and
say
you
cannot
do
this
or
--
or
do
they
have
other
autonomy
that
they
can
do
what
they
want
within
that
charter?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
majority
determines
what
the
public
interest
is?
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
necessarily
self-government,
the
question
is
what
is
the
difference
when
you
get
to
things
that
are
fairly
involved
or
some
essential
--
let's
say
the
law
of
corporation
which
points
out
(inaudible)
changes
in
the
law
of
corporation.
you
don't
consider
that
a
matter
of
organization.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
they're
doing
something
of
that
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wish
your
counsel
said
that
they
haven't
(inaudible)
in
the
lower
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
insurance
and
negligence
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
they
not
take
position
of
any
of
those
matters?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
in
a
short
time
to
have
these
policies
and
all
of
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
--
do
that,
no
one
is
compelled
to
the
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
the
counsel
objected
to
the
regulation
that
(inaudible)
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
was
that
a
reason
for
(inaudible)
medical
profession
held
belong
in
the
organization
and
pay
dues
and
what
the
power
of
the
majority
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
that
that
inducts
preference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
didn't
you
say
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
plumbing
then
to
a
part
of
public
health
and
safety?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
that
question
after,
i
don't
have
the
full
authority
to
say
the
state
bar
for
many
years
to
take
part
with
the
simple
statement
(inaudible).
what
i'm
trying
to
do
in
my
mind
(inaudible)
between
this
case
and
the
basis
of
this
proceeding
and
finding
that
there's
a
little
difference
in
my
mind
at
the
present
time
and
which
i
believe
that
some
of
these
activities
that
we're
talking
about
in
the
two
cases
are
very
much
alike.
and
i
have
to
put
a
little
help
to
see
if
there
--
if
there
is
any
differentiation
between
--
insofar
as
the
first
amendment
is
concerned,
insofar
as
the
right
of
association
and
not
to
association
is
concerned.
if
there
is
any
differentiation,
i'd
like
to
know.
that
--
that's
the
reason
why
i
ask
you
these
questions
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
the
constitutionally
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
--
i
would
agree
on
the
same
principles
say
we're,
if
they
both
were
engaged
in
the
same
types
of
activities
(inaudible)
personal
facts
of
constitutionality
is
the
same
in
both
instances?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
in
that
case,
he
may
object
to
all
the
legislative
factors
as
being
beyond
the
scope
because
it
abridged
the
right
of
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
to
--
to
associate
and
to
speak.
and
that
in
a
sense,
we
say
it's
the
same
taken
under
the
number
of
judgments
in
the
county.
that's
rather
a
political
thing
that
amounts
to
and
quite
and
also
the
question
of
how
much
judges
should
be
paid
is
more
or
less
a
political
thing
and
i
would
think
just
as
much
as
a
minimum
wage
law,
but
in
that
case,
they
contended
that
the
fact
should
then
go
beyond
the
--
the
right
to
impose
on
the
proponents.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
to
answer
an
important
question
that
justice
frankfurter
has
asked
of
the
counsel.
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
a
financial
report?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
no,
it
wasn't
for
that
purpose.
the
important
purpose
is
that
to
ascertain
just
what
the
appellees
state
bar
covered
in
governing
apparently
to
the
court
show
what
the
activities
of
the
state
bar
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
quite
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
to
that
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
attorney
general
reynolds.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
law
is
enforced
at
present
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
--
that's
a
different
thing.
that's
a
different
thing
to
set
up
a
commission
to
regulate.
what
i
mean
is,
could
they
--
with
any
of
the
added
professions
do
exactly
as
they
did
here,
say
that
anyone
in
order
to
--
to
be
--
to
practice
that
profession
in
the
state
must
belong
to
an
organization
of
--
of
that
profession?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
supervision
in
itself
relieved
any
disabilities
because
of
constitutional
defects.
it
could
be
supervision
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
your
associate
to
say
that
within
the
limits
of
this
charter
so-called
that
the
--
that
the
supreme
court
gave
to
the
legal
profession
that
they
had
autonomy
and
that
they
have
absolute
independence
to
act
as
they
see
fit
and
that
is
to
those
manners
the
court
--
the
court
did
not
supervise
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
those
are
the
things
that
are
complained
of.
those
--
those
so-called
political
activities
are
the
things
that
are
being
complained
of.
now,
my
question
is,
could
they
do
the
same
thing
with
every
other
profession
that
the
state
regulates
them
and
i
think
most
states
do
regulate
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they're
not
officers
of
the
--
they're
officers
of
the
court
when
it
comes
to
employing
a
--
a
lobbyist
that
the
legislature
to
--
to
represent
views
of
the
majority
against
the
minority?
that
that
isn't
practiced
at
all,
is
it
for
regulating
their
activities?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
i
don't
doubt
that
at
all.
but
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
general,
is
it
--
if
there's
any
distinction,
legal
--
constitutional
distinction
between
such
activities
of
the
state
bar
and
such
activities
of
any
other
profession
or
business
or
employment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
how
was
the
board
created,
your
real
estate
board?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
and
who
--
who
fills
the
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
the
governor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
strictly
--
strictly
a
real
estate
--
