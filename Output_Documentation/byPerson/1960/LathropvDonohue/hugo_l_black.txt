may
i
ask
you,
where
is
it,
the
quotation
of
the
state
rules
that
compel
the
lawyers
to
belong
to

association?
where
is
that
printed?
justice

where
is
that?
justice

of

statement?

oh,

justice

black
what
is
the
penalty?
justice

black
what
is
the
penalty
for
failing
to
enroll?
justice

black
what
--
what
is
the
law
with
reference
to
one
who
holds
himself
out
or
attempts
to
practice
law
--
justice

black
--
without
permission.
justice

black
is
a
criminal
statute
included

justice

what
is
the
penalty,
do
you
know?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
cite
us
to
that
before
the
argument
is
over?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
you
say
that
was
required
with
reference
to
a
proposal
to
repeal
the
integration
laws?
justice
hugo

black
where
is
that
in

record?
is
that

all
these
things
is
stated
in
the
record?
justice

black
in
all
the

that
you
are
telling
us,
we
can
find
either
in
the
complaint,
in
the
record
or
in
the
judicial
find

knowledge
expressed

justice

black
does
the
state
contribute
anything
to
the
bar
association
funds?
justice

black
what
are
the
dues?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whose
brief,
american
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
presume
that
being
lawyers,
they
sometimes
disagree?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
not
--
that's
not
your
case
here,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
have
many
other
integrated
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
things
as
i
understand
it,
the
hairdressers
and
--
and
the
beauticians
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
farmers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they're
not
anywhere?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
anywhere
--
any
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
they
were.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
it
affects
your
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
your
--
that's
your
real
issue
in
it,
whether
you
can
be
compelled
to
pay
money
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
enter
a
fund
which
will
be
used
in
part,
to
propagate
views
that
you're
against,
whether
the
state
can
compel
you
to
pay
the
money
for
that
purpose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
opinion
of
that
case
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
said
you
just
--
you
just
preserved
the
independence
of
the
bar?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
sounds
to
me
if
i
may
say
so
that
your
--
the
way
you
fix
the
bar,
it
sounds
very
much
like
the
old
nra
where
the
congress
gave
businessmen
not
lawyers,
businessmen
without
a
need
fixed
the
side
of
the
policy
has
on
it
and
then
that
it
was
submitted
to
whatever
governmental
agency
was
there,
they
might
approve
it
or
might
not.
you
submit
yours
to
the
court
and
that
is
the
difference
between
a
delegation
of
power
in
the
nra
and
delegation
of
power
here
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
question
i
was
getting
at
was
this.
it
seems
to
be
that
in
both
of
these
cases,
other
groups
like
this,
the
question
ultimately
gets
down
to
whether
the
government
has
the
power
to
divide
citizens
into
groups
or
segments
according
to,
we'll
say
vocations
or
professions
or
what
not,
somehow
and
provide
that
all
of
them
have
pay
funds
to
run
their
association
and
that
it
can
propagandize
for
the
views
if
the
majority
approved.
is
that
an
unfair
statement
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
right.
i'm
not
familiar
--
i
don't
see
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
have
self-government
--
we
have
self-government
in
this
country
because
we
have
a
government,
but
can
congress
delegate
a
legislative
body
that
--
i
--
i
have
a
hard
time
speaking
of
it
as
self-government
is
a
kind
that
the
country
had,
say
to
divide
groups
and
let
the
government
require
them
to
pay
money
into
that
and
they
make
laws
which
of
a
propagate
ideas
which
are
binding
on
the
minority.
i
understand
that
for
the
government,
but
i
don't
quite
understand
that
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
a
plumbing
lady?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
held
in
that
case
that
it
didn't
violate
the
equal
protection
law,
that
was
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
least
that's
--
at
least
that's
what
i
thought
when
i
wrote
the
opinion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
should
be
compelled
to
take
a
part,
shouldn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then,
you
said
you
know
they
should
take
a
part.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
talking
about
association,
and
you
haven't
yet
discussed
the
question
of
the
collection
of
money,
getting
money
for
the
purpose
of
using
it
to
take
part
in
view
of
what
is
the
political
activity.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
knew
the
passage
of
legislature.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
are
activities
in
connection
of
the
statute
of
the
legislation
on
which
people
differ,
on
which
they
frequently
have
some
of
the
biggest
fights
they
ever
had.
how
many
judges
do
you
have?
what
are
you
going
to
pay
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
do
they
have
a
referendums
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
hadn't
understood.
maybe
i
--
i'm
interested
as
to
prove
is
the
attack
based
with
any
extent
on
the
facts
the
bar
i
think
decided
disciplinary
(inaudible).
i
can
see
where
it
could
be
charged.
was
it
good
enough
that
violated
some
of
the
constitution?
but
i
haven't
understood
that
would
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they're
not
being
silenced.
that
complaint
is
at
least
in
one
respect
that
a
part
of
their
money
taken
out
of
their
pocket
against
their
will
and
put
in
to
a
collective
fund,
part
of
which
is
used
for
the
propagation
of
political
ideas
that
they
are
against.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
not
a
hypothetical
question.
that's
what
i
understand
to
be
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
--
it
wasn't
that
agreed
to
between
you
that
there
were?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
--
are
you
then
depending
on
the
basis
of
the
--
not
that
you
could
do
that
but
does
the
record
doesn't
show
that
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
is
that
what
you're
depending
on
that
if
this
record
doesn't
show
that
you
have
done
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
would
you
raise
that
question
because
that
raises
a
different
question
to
what
i
thought
you
would
raise?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
has
he
claimed
that
it's
violating
the
law
of
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
him
to
say
that
it
was
violating
the
law
of
the
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
government,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
well,
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
the
government
which
as
through
your
judges
has
set
up
a
system
under
which
a
man
to
get
the
right
to
practice
law
has
to
belong
to
the
bar
association.
and
he's
complaining
not
that
he
has
to
be
a
lawyer,
it
maybe
that
they
are
raising
here
the
question
they
can't
do
that
at
all,
but
they're
certainly
raising
the
distinct
question
that
you
cannot
require
them
to
belong
to
association
and
pay
their
dues
and
then
use
them
to
propagate
ideas
that
they're
against.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
quite
a
different
thing.
i
--
i
presume
that
nobody
has
ever
raised
any
question,
whether
the
associate
people
who
belong
to
a
voluntary
association
somehow
i
think
we
have
a
case
on
that
several
years
ago.
some
others
(inaudible)
and
some
are
not,
that
a
voluntary
association
could
spend
its
own
money
is
it
saw
fit
and
they
couldn't
bar
that
--
that's
a
different
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
when
you
force
any
one
man
to
--
to
contribute
money
for
something
he
is
against
is
where
--
what
i
understand
is
one
of
the
questions
they
raise
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
maybe
--
maybe
the
board
if
you
have
this
same
setup
where
you
compel
the
people
to
pay
dues
and
pay
something
into
it
in
order
to
spend
it
for
propaganda
purposes
might
have
the
same
question
they
have
here.
i
don't
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
they
get
--
do
they
get
a
salary
these
real
estate
members?
are
they
officials
of
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
every
lawyer
an
official
of
the
state
under
your
law?
