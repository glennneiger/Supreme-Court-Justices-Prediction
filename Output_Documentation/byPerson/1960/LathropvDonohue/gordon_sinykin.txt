mr.
gordon
sinykin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
argument
on
behalf
of
the
appellee
will
be
divided
between
myself
and
the
attorney
general
of
wisconsin.
and
i
will
try
to
deal
with
the
questions
of
jurisdiction
and
first
amendment
freedoms
and
my
associate
will
discuss
the
proposition
that
integration
of
the
bar
is
a
reasonable
form
and
means
of
regulating
the
profession.
with
respect
to
the
jurisdictional
question
of
whether
an
appeal
lies
in
this
case
under
subsection
2
of
section
1257,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
word
statute
of
any
state
mean
legislative
action
of
some
kind
whether
it
is
direct
action
by
the
legislature
or
--
or
by
delegated
authority
to
a
commissioner
of
board
or
a
municipality
in
the
form
of
municipal
ordinances.
likewise,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
integration
orders
here
in
question,
orders
promulgated
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
constitute
judicial
action.
the
only
question
then,
the
only
possible
issue
is
whether
such
judicial
action
can
be
equated
to
legislative
action
under
the
word
statute
of
any
state
as
it
appears
in
the
appeal
statute.
and
we
think
clearly
not
because
of
the
traditional
distinction
between
legislative
and
judicial
functions
of
the
government
which
would
be
obliterated
if
judicial
action
was
said
to
be
the
same
for
the
purposes
of
the
appeal
statute
as
legislative
action.
as
far
as
appellant's
argument
is
concerned
that
if
the
orders
have
the
effect
of
law,
that
is
true
of
all
judicial
acts.
orders
and
judgments
of
courts
have
the
effect
and
force
of
law
as
in
the
case
of
enactments
of
a
legislature
that
no
one
would
contend
that
thereby,
they
are
state
statutes
under
subsection
2
of
1257.
if
congress
had
intended
the
words
statute
of
any
state
to
apply
to
judicial
action,
it
certainly
as
mr.
--
as
it
has
been
said
by
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
a
dissenting
opinion,
it
could've
made
its
intent
and
meaning
clearer
in
the
wording
of
the
statute.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
they
--
yes,
sir.
they
were
expressed
in
a
dissenting
opinion
with
respect
to
a
different
type
of
action.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
no,
sir.
only
that
they
do
not
come
within
the
provisions
for
review
under
the
subsection
2
by
appeal.
they
should
come
in
under
certiorari.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
yes,
sir.
and
that
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
briefs.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
now
--
mr.
gordon
sinykin
and
the
statute
directed
the
supreme
court
to
implement
it
by
proper
rules,
but
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
in
the
first,
what
i
call
four
integration
cases,
said
that
that
statute
was
not
binding
upon
it
that
integration
of
the
bar
was
a
judicial
function
and
not
a
legislative
function.
and
that
this
statute
merely
declared
the
--
was
a
declaration
by
the
legislature
that
it
would
serve
the
public
interest
to
have
an
integrated
bar.
and
the
court
thereupon
in
this
first
integration
case
which
we
have
cited
several
times
in
our
brief
declined
to
integrate
the
bar.
its
reason
at
that
time
was
that
there
were
so
many
lawyers
in
the
military
service
that
it
thought
that
this
matter
ought
to
be
deferred.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
well,
it
sounds
like
--
mr.
gordon
sinykin
yes,
mr.
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
correct,
sir.
that
is
precisely
what
they
said
in
more
attack
for
language.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
they
traced
--
mr.
gordon
sinykin
well,
that
should
we
--
that
should
we
to
try
to
point
out
in
our
--
mr.
gordon
sinykin
yes
sir
and
we
have
stated
that
in
our
brief
in
--
in
discussing
this
very
jurisdictional
question.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
that's
--
mr.
gordon
sinykin
well,
that
--
that
is
our
argument
your
honor.
that
this
is
judicial
action
and
not
legislative
action
because
of
the
very
fact
that
we
have
had
a
statute
passed
here
by
the
wisconsin
legislature
creating
the
state
bar
and
our
supreme
court
said,
“no”
in
a
lengthy
scholarly
opinion
reviewing
the
authority
of
the
court
with
respect
to
the
profession
and
saying,
this
is
our
responsibility
and
not
your
responsibility.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
that
is
correct,
sir.
the
alleged
statute
is
merely
the
supreme
court
said
in
delicate
language,
“we
appreciate
the
--
the
legislative
enactment
because
it
tells
us
that
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
thinks
it
will
serve
the
public
interest.”
mr.
gordon
sinykin
that's
correct,
sir.
that
opinion
is
in
244
wisconsin
8
and
the
same
doctrine
is
referred
to
in
the
subsequent
integration
cases
in
wisconsin.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
sir,
i
think
that
this
case
presents
with
respect
to
the
integrated
bar
really
only
the
issue
decided
in
hanson
with
respect
to
labor
organizations
namely
the
question
whether
lawyers
can
be
compelled
to
belong
and
pay
dues
to
the
state
bar
in
the
exercise
of
the
state's
power
to
regulate
the
bar.
appellant
has
made
it
clear
here
and
it
certainly
clear
from
his
complaint
and
from
the
record
that
his
objection
as
to
the
general
proposition
of
having
to
belong
to
the
bar.
his
second
objection
is
to
the
bar
rendering
any
legislative
services,
giving
any
legislative
opinions
regardless
of
whether
he
agrees
or
disagrees.
in
fact,
in
his
complaint,
he
doesn't
allege
any
disagreement
except
in
one
instance.
he
says
that
the
state
bar
opposed
some
legislation
which
he
favored
but
he
doesn't
say
what
it
is,
but
going
through
the
few
bills
up
to
the
time
of
the
complaint,
and
going
through
the
few
bills
in
which
the
state
bar
took
the
position
in
the
period
of
a
two
and
a
half
years
of
its
existence
there
were
about
13
or
14
bills
on
which
the
state
bar
took
a
position.
the
only
bill
which
he
had
opposed
that
i
can
see
during
that
time
is
the
bill
to
repeal
the
integrated
bar
act
and
the
position
that
we
took
on
that
was
merely
to
write
a
letter
to
the
assembly
judiciary
committee
which
i
wrote
merely
stating
that
under
the
decisions
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
the
responsibility
for
continuing
or
discontinuing
integration
was
with
it
as
a
matter
of
law
and
not
with
the
legislature
and
that
its
repeal
would
be
ineffective
for
the
purpose
of
disintegrating
the
state
bar.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
so,
we
have
these
general
contentions.
he
hasn't
shown
how
he
has
been
hurt
or
injured.
his
contention
is,
even
if
i
agree
with
every
view
expressed
by
the
state
bar,
as
a
constitutional
matter,
you
can
express
views.
now
first,
as
to
his
contention,
that
his
freedom
of
association
is
violated
by
being
required
to
be
a
member
of
the
integrated
bar.
as
to
that,
his
objection
is
the
same
as
in
hanson
bear
membership
is
a
ground
for
his
objection.
as
he
stated
here,
he
admits
the
power
of
the
state
to
require
a
license
fee
of
lawyers
for
regulatory
purposes.
so,
his
objection
is
not
to
the
annual
dues.
his
objection
runs
to
being
compelled
to
belong
to
an
organization
of
lawyers.
but
he
was
required
to
belong
to
the
bar
before
integration
when
he
of
his
own
free
will
decided
to
become
a
lawyer
and
qualify
himself
to
become
a
lawyer,
he
had
to
be
admitted
to
the
bar,
he
had
to
become
a
member
of
that
bar
and
in
order
to
practice
law,
he
had
to
remain
a
member
in
good
standing.
and
as
such
a
member,
he
accepted
all
the
conditions
and
burdens
and
restraints
which
go
at
the
pre
--
prerogatives.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
he
didn't
have
to
pay
for
it
your
honor
but
he
certainly
could
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
principle
be
compelled
to
pay
a
license
fee
for
regulation.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
he
didn't
object
to
that.
but,
with
respect
to
association,
he
isn't
compelled
now
to
associate
with
anybody
anymore
than
before
integration.
he
doesn't
have
to
attend
a
single
one
of
the
meetings
of
the
bar.
if
he
wants
to
forego
the
benefits
of
those
meetings,
he
is
a
free
citizen
to
forego
then.
he
doesn't
have
to
associate
with
anybody.
he
doesn't
have
to
vote
in
any
elections
we
have
under
the
state
bar
rules,
a
democratic
self
governing
form
of
organization
with
the
right
which
includes
every
single
lawyer
in
the
state
and
there
is
no
distinction
as
to
class
or
creed,
religion
or
race.
it
represents
everybody
and
everybody
is
given
an
opportunity
to
vote.
everybody
is
given
an
opportunity
to
make
his
voice
heard
in
the
self-government
of
this
organization,
but
he
was
compelled
before
integration
to
submit
the
certain
restraints.
as
a
lawyer,
he
does
not
have
the
full
freedom
of
any
other
citizen.
he
is
subject
to
the
control
and
the
discipline
and
the
supervision
of
the
court
because
he
is
a
part
of
that
primary
function
of
government,
the
administration
of
justice.
he,
the
lawyer
is
the
moving
and
advising
officer
of
the
court
and
as
such,
he
is
always
subject
to
the
discipline
and
the
regulation
of
the
court.
what
integration
did
was
simply
to
take
this
body
of
court
officers,
called
the
bar,
and
give
it
a
constitution
in
the
form
of
rules
and
bylaws
under
which
the
profession
could
operate
with
the
form
of
self-government.
all
was
subject
to
the
continuing
supervision
of
the
court
and
the
court
has
said
in
these
integration
cases,
they
said
in
this
case
the
court
below
and
in
5
wisconsin,
“we
stand
here
ready
to
take
any
remedial
action
if
the
integrated
bar
should
abuse
its
powers
or
step
beyond
the
lines
we
had
delineated
or
otherwise,
do
anything
which
is
not
in
keeping
with
the
public
purposes
which
the
integrated
bar
is
suppose
to
serve.”
but
the
supreme
--
mr.
gordon
sinykin
your
honor,
they
are
autonomous
and
the
supreme
court
has
pointed
out
in
5
wisconsin.
that
we
will
not
be
a
censor
of
the
bar
as
long
as
they
stay
within
the
limits
that
we
have
marked
out
in
these
rules
and
bylaws.
we
believe
in
an
independent
bar
and
we
want
to
foster
this
idea
of
independence,
but
the
integrated
bar
is
for
--
is
to
serve
public
purposes
--
public
interest.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
and
the
majority
determines
questions
of
self-government
within
--
mr.
gordon
sinykin
no,
sir.
we
don't.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
the
board
of
governors
of
the
executive
committee
is
given
a
discretion
and
judgment
to
decide
what
view
to
take
on
such
matters,
but
when
it
comes
to
the
question
of
corporations,
the
question
would
be
whether
it
is
within
the
narrow
confines
of
what
the
court
has
said
we
can't
take
positions
of.
the
court
has
limited
us
strictly
to
administration
of
justice,
the
court
reforms,
practice
and
procedure.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
they
--
these
sections
--
the
sections
you
see
that
in
the
bar
as
you
undoubtedly
know,
there
are
number
of
committees
and
a
number
of
sections.
there
is
a
section
that
deals
with
corporate
law.
they
study
corporate
law.
there
is
a
section
on
taxation.
they
study
questions
of
taxation.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
insurance
and
negligence
and
family
law
labor
relations
and
so
forth,
but
that
studying
these
things
having
forums,
having
discussions
on
the
problems
and
on
the
meanings
of
the
laws
and
the
decisions
as
they
come
down,
there's
quite
a
different
matter
from
taking
a
position
on
the
legislative
measure.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
they
do
not
take
positions
on
any
of
those
matters
except
and
unless
they
relate
to
the
administration
of
justice,
practice
and
procedure.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
yes,
sir.
the
court
in
this
case
said
we
couldn't
do
that.
the
court
said
that
we
have
to
stay
within
these
limits
and
that
--
in
that
respect,
we
are
different
from
the
american
bar
association
or
the
bar
association
you
just
mentioned.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
the
workings
of
the
court.
they
are
just
--
mr.
gordon
sinykin
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
could
--
mr.
gordon
sinykin
i
think
we
have
been
unduly
limited.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
but,
they
have
preserved
the
independence
on
the
bar
but
on
legislative
matters,
they
have
limited
the
bar
to
these
narrow
fields
apparently
with
the
thought
of
keeping
us
out
of
the
political
sphere.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
yes,
sir.
i
think
they
can.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
i
would
think
that
that
would
come
under
administration
of
justice.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
i
would
say
so,
sir.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
i
would
say
that
wasn't.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
well,
your
honor,
up
to
now
in
four
years
of
integration,
we
have
taken
positions
on
i
think
19
or
20
measures,
so
that
there
hasn't
been
any
problem.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
well
--
where
--
where
a
young
growing
integrated
bar.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
well,
i
think
that
we
should
be
permitted
your
honor
to
go
further
than
the
narrow
limits
that
the
court
has
laid
out
for
us,
but
we
should
stay
out
of
matters
which
are
political.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
we
do
not
submit
our
legislative
proposals
to
the
court.
the
board
of
governors
--
mr.
gordon
sinykin
well,
i
don't
think
that
in
the
case
of
the
legislative
measures
of
--
mr.
gordon
sinykin
i
don't
think
it's
propaganda,
but
i
do
think
that
the
idea
of
giving
a
group
that
is
subject
to
regulation
and
that
has
particularly
heavy
public
duties,
the
opportunity
for
self-government
is
a
good
one.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
your
honor,
if
it's
correct
for
the
government
then
you
have
it
happening
all
the
time,
in
all
different
levels
of
government,
taking
positions
on
legislative
matter
and
even
lobbying
and
i
can
say
to
all
kinds
of
even
the
judicial
conference
of
the
united
states
makes
legislative
recommendations.
now
--
mr.
gordon
sinykin
the
integrated
bar
is
a
governmental
agency
too.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
but,
public
funds
are
being
used
to
support
this
effort.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
i
agree
that
--
i
think
that
that
would
be
constitutional
and
valid
in
the
case
--
mr.
gordon
sinykin
i'm
not
so
sure
about
that.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
because
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
it
maybe
constitutional
in
the
case
of
commerce
but
i
have
a
little
more
difficulty
because
the
medical
profession
has
a
much
greater
public
service
--
public
interest
served.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
health,
life
and
death
--
mr.
gordon
sinykin
[attempt
to
laughter]
yes,
i
have.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
it
might
be
that
--
that
the
plumbers
too
could
be
regulated
in
that
fashion.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
differentiation
between
hanson
in
this
case
on
the
proposition
of
freedom
of
association.
i
think
the
principle
established
in
hanson
as
far
as
freedom
of
association
is
concerned
applies
to
this
case
too
although
of
course
the
bar
is
different
than
a
labor
union.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
well,
although
--
i
mean,
in
make
up,
but
i
think
the
constitutional
principle
applies
that
if
you
can
compel
persons
to
belong
to
a
labor
union
in
the
interest
of
the
legitimate
governmental
objective
of
maintaining
industrial
peace
along
the
arteries
of
commerce,
you
certainly
should
be
able
to
compel
lawyers
to
belong
to
a
bar
organization
in
the
interest
of
improving
the
profession
in
regulating
a
profession
and
improving
and
promoting
the
administration
of
justice.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
yes,
sir,
but
i
do
think
there
is
a
difference
here
between
our
case
and
the
case
of
street
in
that
we
do
not
support
any
political
or
judicial
candidates,
we
do
not
engage
in
any
ideological,
political
partisan
activity
of
any
kind.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
well,
when
you
deal
with
subjects
that
are
in
these
loaded
fields
which
the
court
has
marked
out
in
this
case,
your
honor,
there
maybe
some
political
aspects
to
them
or
to
some
of
them,
but
in
the
main,
they
are
technical,
noncontroversial
items
of
legislation
in
which
the
lawyer
certainly
ought
to
take
a
part.
i
think
the
bar
has
been
--
mr.
gordon
sinykin
well,
they're
not
compelled
to
take
a
part.
they're
--
mr.
gordon
sinykin
yes.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
i
don't
think
they
--
mr.
gordon
sinykin
i
don't
think
they
are
political
activities.
and
in
--
mr.
gordon
sinykin
but
other
public
agencies
are
taking
--
mr.
gordon
sinykin
other
public
agencies
are
taking
positions
on
legislation
all
the
time.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
i
would
say
that
that
was
within
the
sphere
of
the
administration
of
justice.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
yes,
sir.
i
can
think
of
a
lot
more
political
--
mr.
gordon
sinykin
it
--
it
certainly
has
political
--
mr.
gordon
sinykin
yes,
i
do.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
yes,
i
do,
sir.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
yes,
i
do.
but
--
mr.
gordon
sinykin
well,
i
am
not
so
--
this
term
political
means
many
things
and
we
don't
seem
to
be
concerned
--
we
don't
seem
to
be
concern
with
all
of
the
departments
of
government
who
--
mr.
gordon
sinykin
my
time
is
up
and
my
associate
will
now
take
over.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
the
state
bar,
your
honor,
furnishes
an
annual
report
to
the
supreme
court,
a
financial
report.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
just
a
financial
report
and
i
might
say
that
there
is
continuing
supervision
here
in
that
officers
of
the
state
bar
meet
with
the
court
from
time
to
time
to
go
over
their
affairs,
so
it
isn't
a
thing
that
isn't
a
case
of
there
being
just
out
here
and
left
alone
to
without
any
guidance.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
i
don't
have
such
a
report.
we
might
be
able
to
find
something
that
would
be
in
the
nature
of
such
--
which
should
give
such
information.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
no,
sir.
we
don't.
we
did
make
a
report
to
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
in
1958
when
the
integration
was
considered
as
to
whether
it
shall
be
continued.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
well,
we
sent
out
--
mr.
gordon
sinykin
no,
sir.
we
have
not
sent
out
any
particular
questions.
the
only
ballot
we
sent
out
is
written
out
of
ballot
it's
a
--
what
it
is
in
the
sense
a
questionnaire
each
year
when
the
dues
statements
are
sent
out
a
--
statement
is
sent
out
asking
the
members
of
the
bar
to
suggest
any
changes
in
the
rule
of
bylaws
and
activities
or
any
improvements
that
could
be
made.
that's
the
only
sort
of
thing
to
do.
i
would
like
to
comment
on
one
more
thing
that
was
--
mr.
gordon
sinykin
yes,
sir.
we
will
do
that.
on
this
question
of
discipline,
a
statement
was
made
here
by
counsel
that
our
disciplinary
procedure
is
the
same
under
the
integrated
bar
as
it
was
under
the
voluntary
bar
and
i
just
beg
to
differ
with
them
that
we
have
an
entirely
different
procedure
under
the
full
voluntary
bar.
we
really
didn't
have
any
grievance
procedure.
we
had
a
little
grievance
committee
and
that
it
would
pass
the
complaints
on
to
the
local
bar
associations
and
more
serious
ones
would
go
up
to
the
state
board
of
bar
commissioners.
now,
we
have
a
very
extensive
set
up
whereby
the
state
is
divided
into
nine
districts
and
there
are
grievance
committees
of
at
least
five
lawyers
in
each
district
where
a
regular
procedure
that
they
follow
for
handling
these
things
and
for
investigating
them
and
for
holding
hearings
and
for
passing
on
their
recommendations.
they
also
have
the
right
to
investigate
misconduct
--
judicial
misconduct
i
noticed
in
the
rules.
they
also
have
the
function
and
duty
of
investigating
the
reinstatement
of
disbarred
or
suspended
lawyers
who
are
petitioning
for
reinstatement
and
make
recommendations
to
the
board
of
bar
governors
and
to
the
supreme
court
with
respect
to
those
things.
and
i
think
that
the
report
will
show
that
within
the
last
year
and
quarter
or
so,
last
two
years
i
think
it
is,
they
handled
around
232
grievance
complaints
as
against
17
that
were
handled
in
the
year
before
integration
and
eight
that
were
handled
in
the
second
year
before
integration.
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
this
had
been
due
to
the
fact
that
when
you
got
price
and
much
money,
you
can
do
a
lot
of
things
you
can
employ
personnel.
they
have
a
paid
investigator
who
is
full
time
working
on
investigation
of
grievances,
the
unauthorized
practice
of
the
law
and
assisting
the
professional
ethics
committee
in
interpreting
its
rules.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
no,
that
is
not
involved,
sir.
because
the
supreme
courts
still
retains
the
power
on
due
hearing
and
notice
to
decide
disbarment
and
suspension
cases.
mr.
gordon
sinykin
up
to
now,
it
doesn't.
no
sir.
it
hasn't
entered
in
that
field.
