justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
--
is
that
--
what
do
you
set
forth
in
your
complaint
as
the
--
as
the
greed
--
as
the
palm
that
comes
to
you
that
when
--
i
was
about
to
say,
you're
happily
here
so
you
can
best
tell,
what
this
means
to
a
particular
fellow
who
doesn't
want
to
join
and
doesn't
want
to
be
integrated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
have
you
set
forth
in
your
complaint
will
follow,
if
this
judgment
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
stands?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
which
--
could
you
--
if
you
could
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
just
return
to
the
exact
--
to
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
not
the
rules,
but
what
you
said
is
the
damage
your
complaint
or
hurt,
the
hindrance
upon
protected
freedom
if
not
proper
the
interest
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
it
set
forth?
justice
felix
frankfurter
page
what
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
--
what
if
i
read
it,
not
actually
read
it,
right
now,
why
wouldn't
i
--
what
is
there
in
it
that
you
state
that
makes
a
difference
from
an
invitation
to
join
a
fraternity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
required
means
that
if
you
--
the
question
is
that
justice
black
has
been
pursuing
with
you,
required
means
that
if
you
don't
do
something,
it
makes
a
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
you
--
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
you
couldn't
argue
a
case
before
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
now
giving
a
list
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
proposals
by
the
bar
to
which
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
maybe
things
to
which
you
may
or
in
fact
do
with
which
you
in
fact
--
with
which
--
with
which
you
may
or
in
fact
do
disagree,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
or
are
you
saying
this,
"if
you
can't
be
coerced
to
express
even
your
convictions."
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
cannot
be
coerced
by
state
action
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
should
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
keen
to
express
your
conviction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
relation
of
the
--
of
your
supreme
court
to
the
--
to
the
schemes
of
this
integrated
bar?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
--
do
any
reports
of
the
doings
of
the
association
at
the
bar,
go
to
the
supreme
court
or
to
anybody?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
haven't
got
those
copies
of
that
about,
have
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
you
--
as
i
inferred
that
there's
a
separate
document
called
an
annual
report
by
the
officers
of
the
bar
that
go
to
the
supreme
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what's
the
theory
or
the
--
does
the
statute
make
this
a
requirement
of
the
budgets
that
go
to
the
supreme
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
just
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
relation
â€“
tenure
relation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
is
it
--
do
you
imply
by
your
argument
or
do
you
make
the
argument
because
of
the
implications
that
it
carries,
it
would
carry,
if
this
statute
were
found
not
to
be
unconstitutional
regarding
the
coercive
power
of
a
state
to
make
people
join
all
sorts
of
organizations.
is
that
the
fear
the
considers
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
does
that
mean
that
you
would
think
that
if
this
court
sustained
this
statute
that
the
milwaukee
legislature
could
pass
a
statute
of
every
able-bodied
man
between
18
and
45
must
join
the
(inaudible)
milwaukee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
take
one
step,
you
must
take
six
others.
and
he's
one
other
--
he's
one
other,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
leads
me
to
ask
whether
you
could
expand
on
the
question
i
put
to
you
earlier.
what
is
the
connection
and
what
is
more
particularly
the
authority
that
the
supreme
court
has
over
the
doings
of
the
integrated
bar?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
here
--
here,
the
state
made
this
determination
in
matters
that
are
concerned
of
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
here,
wherein
--
wherein
is
the
power
of
the
state
to
make
a
determination
accommodating
conflicting
interest
as
to
state
matters,
any
different
from
the
power
of
congress
as
to
matters
confined
to
its
competent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
on
what
basis
did
it
sustain
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
it
anymore
disciplinary
power
in
the
full
meaning
of
that
term
than
the
voluntary
bar
association
had
in
wisconsin?
in
other
words,
if
the
mechanism
by
which
matters
are
brought
to
the
attention
of
what
ultimately
is
the
determination
of
the
supreme
court,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh
--
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
state
or
if
the
bar
association
will
ever
represent
whoever
is
the
respondent,
is
it
claimed
that
in
fact,
they
did
not
express
views?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
claimed
that
they
did
not
express
views
in
all
sorts
of
subjects?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
--
on
matters
that
come
within
the
confines
of
--
of
their
functioning
scope,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
their
functioning
scope
is
just
the
kind
of
questions
that
the
chief
justice
would
earlier,
salaries
of
justice
that
of
judges
at
tenure,
etcetera,
etcetera?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
your
state,
does
every
lawyer
agree
that
a
public
defender
system
is
desirable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
public
defender
system
is
the
desirable
way
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
taking
--
taking
--
of
remedying
a
real
evil.
has
every
lawyer
in
wisconsin
agreed
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
the
great
division
of
opinion
on
that
subject
--
might
have
penetrated
even
wisconsin.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
every
lawyer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
your
argument
suggests
--
your
argument
suggests
that
some
better
reasons
could
be
found
for
the
conclusion
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
than
it
gave,
but
if
better
reasons
can
be
found
and
they
must
be
attributed
to
that
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
then
you
must
say
as
i
suggest
that
you
do
say,
but
if
they
spelled
all
these
out,
it
still
would've
been
a
coercion
that
involved
and
in
fact
you
may
go
right
to
be
free
from
having
a
coerced
opinion
expressly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i'm
talking
about
this
case.
i'm
talking
about
if
an
integrated
bar
can
be
justified
by
considerations
that
saved
it
--
that
saved
this
scheme
from
unconstitutionality,
that
saves
the
--
the
rule
--
the
ruling
of
your
supreme
court
from
unconstitutionality,
then
the
mere
fact
that
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
has
written
as
good
as
opinion
as
could
be
written,
would
be
immaterial,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
to
say,
we're
bound
by
the
insight
and
the
literary
skill
and
the
economy
of
time
at
the
disposal
of
the
state
courts
in
deciding
whether
a
statute
is
constitutional
or
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
for
anyone
of
those
reasons,
if
they
didn't
write
the
opinion
satisfactorily
or
some
other
member
of
that
court
thought
as
could've
written
a
better
opinion,
it's
concealed
on
--
under
the
anonymity
of
per
curiam.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
that's
all
--
if
you
say
that,
then
you
say
--
then
there's
no
complaint
about
they
didn't
give
this
reason
or
that
reason.
then
your
position
is
that
no
reasons
could
vindicate
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
read
--
at
least
i
can
read
the
opinion
as
saying,
"only
this
and
nothing
more."
it
gives
--
it
makes
a
long
speech
about
the
--
the
help
that
expressions
of
opinion
give
also
stating
right
along
side
of
it,
the
complete
freedom
to
the
individual
to
have
his
say,
doesn't
it,
this
opinion?
this
opinion
says,
despite
the
mobilization
of
professional
opinion
through
this
mechanism
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
any
member
and
every
member
of
the
bar
can
have
his
say.
