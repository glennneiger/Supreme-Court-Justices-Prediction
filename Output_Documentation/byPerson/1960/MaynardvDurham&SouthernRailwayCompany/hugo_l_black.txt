justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
pleadings,
i
don't
quite
understand.
the
defendants
pleaded
the
release,
that's
an
amendment
under
your
procedures.
you
filed
something
which
you
called
a
reply,
that's
what
you
only
call
a
replication?
you
call
it
a
replication
in
north
carolina?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
--
in
paragraph
4
of
your
replication,
you
said
that
the
amount
paid
was
not
far
a
release
for
damages
but
was
for
wages
due.
what
followed
there
--
what
pleading
followed
that
in
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
with
reference
to
that
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
raises
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
that
was
for
payment,
for
the
injury
or
payment
for
wages
that
is
this
replication
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
put
--
well
that's
what
it
says,
that's
what
you
charge.
that
--
did
that
become
an
issue
or
was
it
necessary
for
them
on
the
old
pleadings
to
deny
that,
if
they
wanted
to
deny
it,
i
don't
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
deemed
denied
by
being
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
did
they
offer
any
evidence
on
that
point
as
to
the
wages
that
was
due
him,
was
there
any
offer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
pointed
to
some
which
he
thought
raised
that
point
by
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
what
he
referred
to
and
what
you
have
referred
to
is
the
total
relevant
evidence
on
that
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
there
any
evidence
beside
here
that
much
you
had
with
reference
to
what
was
the
policy
of
the
company
when
men
were
off
injured
to
whether
they
could
pay
them.
