mr.
charles
b.
nye
mr.
chief
justice.
i
like
to
say
first,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
north
carolina
supreme
court
did
not
rule
in
accordance
with
the
applicable
federal
authorities.
it
was
stipulated
in
the
trial
court
and
the
record
will
show
that
the
case
was
to
be
decided
by
federal
law.
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
recognized
that
the
case
should
be
decided
by
federal
law.
it
recognized
the
problem
before
it,
because
it
says,
“the
only
question
to
be
determined
is
whether
or
not
the
issue
fraud
and
lack
of
consideration
should
go
to
jury.”
so
what
i
am
here
doing
now,
is
arguing
a
nonsuit
motion,
because
there
is
no
law
in
conflict.
there
is
no
law
that
i
know
of
that
the
petitioner
cited
that
i
am
in
fundamental
disagreement
with.
now,
he
raised
two
questions
in
his
petition.
he
cited
the
same
two
questions
in
his
brief,
but
he
did
not
as
such,
discussed
the
questions.
he
raised
five
points
and
discussed
five
points.
i
would
like
to
mark
--
remark
briefly
on
each
of
the
five
points.
his
first
point,
was
federal
not
state
law
prevails
is
conceded
here,
is
conceded
in
the
trial
court,
it
was
conceded
in
the
supreme
of
north
carolina.
his
second
point
was
defendant
concedes
evidence
sufficient
to
take
the
case
to
the
jury
had
the
plaintiff
not
signed
the
so-called
release.
in
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina,
my
statement
was
the
evidence
was
properly
sufficient
to
go
to
the
jury
on
negligence,
had
not
the
release
existed,
but
if
you
will
read
this
evidence,
there
is
not
enough
evidence
of
negligence.
there
is
not
enough
evidence
of
injury
to
support
a
jury
verdict
for
negligence
and
damages,
but
that
question
was
not
before
the
supreme
court,
it
is
not
before
this
court,
but
it
does
have
some
bearing
on
the
entire
picture
of
this
action.
mr.
charles
b.
nye
no,
sir.
that
was
raised
to
support
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
petitioner's
point
3
is
this,
“only
preponderance
or
greater
weight
of
evidence
is
required
to
set
a
signed
release."
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
stated
that
and
recognized
the
federal
principle.
it
was
conceded
in
my
brief
that
that
is
the
law.
petitioner's
point
4,
so-called
release
unsupported
by
any
consideration
and
therefore
void.
i'd
like
to
say
that,
in
--
in
that
connection
this.
now,
we
can
follow
the
petitioner's
logic
to
this
extent.
i
can
file
an
action
for
wrongful
death
and
bring
the
deceased
in
the
court
to
testify
he
is
dead
we've
got
a
conflict
of
evidence
and
it
has
to
go
to
jury
whether
or
not
he's
dead.
now,
that
if
you
call
cow
mule,
that
cow
is
not
a
mule.
the
--
the
plaintiff
testified
at
various
times
about
--
dealt
with
so
much
for
labor,
dealt
with
so
much
for
wages,
but
on
page
26,
now,
here
is
where
we
come
clear,
the
judge
can't
close
his
eyes
and
recognize
the
truth
as
it
comes
out.
i
did
not
know
that
it
was
standing
policy
to
durham
&
southern
railway
company
that
when
an
employee
is
injured
on
the
railroad
that
it
would
pay
the
injured
employee
only
upon
the
signing
a
release,
that's
important
because
the
plaintiff's
own
witness,
his
labor
supervisor
stated
that
it
had
been
a
policy
for
forty
years,
this
is
the
plaintiffs
evidence.
now
i
thought
--
mr.
charles
b.
nye
--
they
were
--
mr.
charles
b.
nye
the
plaintiff
testified
and
then
he
put
on
his
labor
supervisor
as
his
own
witness.
on
cross-examination
mr.
bailey
testified
that
for
forty
years,
the
policy
of
the
railroad
had
been
that
if
when
an
employee
was
injured
and
was
off
from
work
when
came
back
regardless
of
responsibility,
they
paid
him
his
back
wages
while
he
was
out
for
the
consideration
to
sign
a
release,
that's
the
plaintiff's
evidence.
mr.
charles
b.
nye
yes,
sir,
but
he
was
a
--
a
labor
representative,
a
union
labor
representative.
mr.
charles
b.
nye
and
he
testified
and
my
position
is
to
be
sure
that
the
employees
get
a
fair
break.
now,
this
is
what
the
petitioner
testifies
about
those
wages.
i
thought
they
were
paying
while
you
were
out.
i
mean
i
hadn't
been
discharged
from
the
railroad.
i
just
wasn't
able
to
work.
i
have
never
been
discharged.
i
expected
wages
when
i
was
not
working
because
i
just
figured
it
was
mine.
i
have
never
been
discharged
form
the
railroad
and
was
just
off
because
i
was
hurt.
now,
is
he
due
those
wages
because
of
labor?
now
is
he
playing
words,
the
facts
are
he
was
out
four
or
five
days.
the
--
the
railroad
gave
him
the
equivalent
salary
and
he
signed
the
release.
now,
that's
your
consideration,
now,
when
one
reads
this
record,
it
is
inconceivable
to
me
that
you
could
come
up
with
a
theory
that
that
was
due
for
labor,
he
referred
to
it
as
labor,
he
referred
to
this
wages,
but
there
again,
is
cow
a
mule
because
you
refer
it
back
and
forth,
the
truth
came
out
of
this.
mr.
charles
b.
nye
no
sir,
he
did
not.
mr.
charles
b.
nye
no,
sir.
mr.
charles
b.
nye
the
man
had
worked
for
the
sea
board
for
nine
years,
your
honor
before
he
came
on
the
government
and
he
was
an
apprentice
foreman.
he
was
educated,
he
was
--
went
through
10th
grade
and
it
--
in
reference
to
the
check,
he
testified
that
it
was
a
different
place
from
where
i
usually
sign
for
my
check,
that's
his
regular
word.
he
testified
that
he
usually
didn't
sign
things
without
looking
at
them,
but
just
on
the
question
of
consideration,
it
is
my
opinion
that
one
can
read
the
entire
record
and
state
that
he'd
labored
for
these
wages.
it
was
equivalent
of
--
of
what
he
would
receive
had
he
worked.
mr.
charles
b.
nye
your
honor,
he
was
out
--
mr.
charles
b.
nye
--
he
stopped
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
b.
nye
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
b.
nye
now,
just
as
the
side
remark,
the
petitioner
in
his
brief
stated
that
saturday
was
a
normal
work
day.
the
only
evidence
is
that
said,
it's
not
a
normal
work
day.
that's
--
that's
what
the
record
says.
mr.
charles
b.
nye
yes,
sir
and
that's
what
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
b.
nye
--
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina.
mr.
charles
b.
nye
yes,
sir.
now,
i
think
it's
very
important
just
to
get
--
mr.
charles
b.
nye
what
--
he
act
--
cannot
read
otherwise.
he
--
he
says,
“i
didn't
know
that
it
was
policy.”
but
he
says,
“i
didn't
work,
i
just
felt
was
doing
--
mr.
charles
b.
nye
that
is
right.
but
his
own
witness,
the
next
witness
testified
as
to
40-year
policy,
that
when
the
railroad's
witness.
mr.
charles
b.
nye
this
is
based
on
fraud,
your
honor,
not
--
not
mistake.
now,
you
paid
alleged
the
state.
instead
of
the
vicious
(inaudible)
they
did,
that
we
might
not
be
here,
but
they
didn't
allege
mistake.
they
didn't
offer
any
evidence
concerning
mistake.
that
brings
us
up
to
the
next
point.
mr.
charles
b.
nye
well,
the
question
--
i
don't
think
--
mr.
charles
b.
nye
the
other
one
is
no
consideration.
mr.
charles
b.
nye
which
is
a
big
difference
in
the
--
in
the
period
of
the
state
--
mr.
charles
b.
nye
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
b.
nye
they
tried
to
set
aside.
mr.
charles
b.
nye
that's
right,
sir.
well,
the
first
point
i
show
that
there
are
about
a
little
bit
of
consideration,
by
then
very
small
related
portion
on
that,
they
said
no
consideration.
the
next
part,
execution
of
the
so-called
release
procured
by
fraud,
misrepresentations
and
undue
influence
on
the
part
of
the
defendant's
agents,
required
submission
of
the
jury
and
here's
your
evidence
in
that
respect,
page
25
of
the
record.
now,
there
were
two
estimates
executed,
he
was
hurt
on
august
27th,
so
he
says
then
on
august
23rd,
there
was
accident
report
signed
by
the
petitioner
and
he
was
referring
on
page
25
the
accident
report.
it
states
on
here
that
i
would
probably
have
no
disability,
that
none
were
expected.
i
didn't
expect
much
disability
at
that
time.
i
didn't
know
how
bad
my
disability
was
at
that
time.
i
didn't
expect
any
permanent
disability.
i
just
thought
it
was
a
mild
back
sprain
and
that
i
would
get
over
in
a
few
weeks
or
a
month.
when,
i
signed
it
with
the
answer
to
the
problem
of
disability,
"i
mean
it
at
that
time,"
that
was
just
a
few
days
before
the
release.
at
the
time
i
filled
out
that
accident
report,
i
had
no
idea
i
would
ever
get
the
lawsuit
back.
now,
just
a
few
days
later,
he
signs
a
release,
an
evidence
concerning
that.
now
--
now,
the
evidence
shows
that
this
accident
report
which
was
signed
in
apex,
north
carolina
where
he
says,
no
disability,
everything
was
held
properly,
were
set
to
mcallister
in
durham,
north
carolina,
a
few
days
before
the
petitioner
went
to
durham
and
signed
this
release.
the
evidence
is
that
mcallister
knew
nothing
about
the
accident,
nothing
about
the
facts,
except
what
was
set
forth
in
that
accident
report
signed
by
maynard
which
he
says,
“when
i
signed
it,
i
didn't
think
i'll
be
hurting.”
so,
on
page
31,
we
were
talking
about
the
day
he
signed
the
release,
i
do
not
know
what
i
--
i
did
not
know
what
i'm
signing
that
day.
i
did
not
have
any
curiosity
about
it.
i
thought
i
was
just
signing
for
my
check.
i
just
assumed
that's
what
i
was
doing.
it
was
at
a
different
place
from
where
i
usually
signed
for
my
check.
i
haven't
--
then
he
goes
back
to
personnel
injury
report.
i
admit
signing
the
personnel
injury
report,
but
i
don't
remember
when
or
what
time
to
sign,
i
couldn't
say.
if
i
knew
what
the
personnel
injury
report
was
at
the
time
signed
it,
but
i'd
usually
don't
sign
papers
not
knowing
what
they
are.
now,
we
get
back
to
the
release,
this
fellow,
they
say
was
used
duress
and
fraud.
mr.
mcallister
didn't
tell
me
anything
about
it,
he
didn't
tell
me
a
story
about
it,
all
he
did
was
ask
me
how
or
was
on
that
particular
day.
i
don't
know
how
--
i
didn't
know
how
long
in
the
future,
i
still
thought
it
was
temporary.
what
was
there
from
mr.
mcallister
to
defraud
him
about?
mr.
mcallister
didn't
know
the
things
that
what
he
put
on
the
--
on
the
accident
report.
and
--
and
certainly,
if
the
plaintiff
himself
thought
it
was
temporary,
there
was
nothing
for
under
defraud
and
there
was
nothing
for
mcallister
to
make
a
--
misrepresentation
about
at
that
time.
that
could
have
been
a
mutual
mistake.
we're
not
here
on
mutual
mistake.
at
that
time
i
didn't
know
what
it
was
--
that
i
was
signing
or
wouldn't
sign
it,
he
did
testify
that.
at
that
time
mr.
mcallister
didn't
know
what
disability
might
be
in
the
future
from
my
injury.
he
didn't
make
any
false
misrepresentation.
the
only
thing
he
did
do
there,
he
just
didn't
explain
the
paper
to
me.
he
didn't
make
any
deceitful
suggestions
to
me.
he
didn't
make
any
fraudulent
suggestions
to
me.
he
just
put
the
paper
down
there
and
i
signed
it
and
got
my
check
and
left.
i
didn't
think
i
was
going
to
be
pertinent
in
the
future.
what
was
there
to
misrepresent
this
man
who
was
an
apprentice
foreman,
who
would
had
been
on
the
railroad
for
9
or
10
or
11
years,
who
the
record
shows,
talked
to
his
union
representative
before
he
filed
the
accident
report
and
knew
all
their
in
his
negotiations
went
through
his
labor
representatives.
the
trial
judge
heard
the
evidence,
he
nonsuited.
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
fully
and
fairly
recognized
each
and
every
question
presented
to
it.
and
i
state
that
there
was
only
one
question
before
this
court.
and
my
question
was
this,
the
question
for
determination
is
whether
or
not,
the
plaintiff's
evidence,
in
supporting
his
--
allegations
that
the
release
was
without
consideration
and
rather
procured
by
means
of
fraud
and
duress
was
sufficient
the
warrant
its
submission
to
the
jury.
i
quoted
the
only
question
before
this
court
from
page
55
of
the
record
which
is
a
quote
from
the
decision
of
the
north
carolina
supreme
court.
now,
what
the
supreme
court,
it
recognized
both
of
those.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
before
us
to
support
the
contention
of
plaintiff
that
he
was
entitled
as
a
matter
of
right
to
the
$144.60
as
wages
for
the
time
he
did
not
work
because
of
his
alleged
injuries.
therefore,
unless
the
release
was
procured
by
fraud
and
duress
as
alleged
in
plaintiff's
reply
to
the
appropriate
matter
pleading
in
defendants
answer,
the
judgement
of
nonsuit
entered
in
the
court
below
must
be
upheld.
as
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
construes
the
evidence,
he
does
not
show
any
fraud
or
duress
on
the
part
of
defendant
or
its
agency.
but
on
the
contrary,
his
own
testimony
negates
his
allegations
in
that
respect.
in
our
opinion
the
plaintiff
and
defendant
entered
into
the
release
in
good
faith,
neither
party
at
time
of
the
execution
of
the
release,
had
any
idea
to
the
plaintiff
has
sustained
an
injury
that
might
or
would
develop
into
any
permanent
disability.
there
are
may
have
been
mutual
mistake
on
the
part
of
plaintiff
and
the
defendant
in
this
respect
as
was
alleged
and
relied
on
in
cohen
versus
pennsylvania
railroad,
supra.
however,
in
instant
case,
the
plaintiff's
cause
of
action
is
not
about
a
mere
mistake,
but
on
fraud
and
duress.
in
the
light
of
the
record
before
us
in
the
applicable
decisions
bearing
thereon,
we
are
constrained
to
hold
that
the
ruling
of
the
court
below
must
be
upheld.
so
that's
the
reason
i
say,
“we're
here
arguing
a
motion
of
nonsuit.”
the
record
gets
smaller
and
smaller,
as
it
comes
up
in
the
trial
court.
but
the
truth
came
out
at
the
trial
we
call
the
cow,
mule,
but
it
was
still
a
cow.
he
referred
it
as
labor,
he
referred
to
his
wages,
but
the
record
and
the
plaintiff's
evidence
shows
that
it
was
a
small
consideration,
it
was
a
consideration.
they
have
not
based
his
answer
on
--
insignificant
consideration
or
mutual
mistake.
they
based
their
action
on
a
very
vicious
reply
alleging
all
types
of
fraud
and
duress
were
at
the
time
and
i
repeat,
there
was
nothing
for
mcallister
in
this
representation.
