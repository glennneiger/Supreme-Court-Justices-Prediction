justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
what
is
your
complaint
that
--
the
copy
that
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
applied
the
wrong
standard?
isn't
this
on
determination
that
whatever
the
appropriate
standard
is,
the
proofs
were
not
sufficient
to
raise
the
jury
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
in
other
words
that
there
was
deficiency
in
the
quantum
of
proof,
isn't
that
the
basis
on
which
they
turned
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
the
$144.60
pay,
wasn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
your
point
that
the
only
evidence
--
there
was
at
least
a
jury
question
although
that
did
--
was
the
consideration
supporting
the
release
or
not,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
apparently,
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
contention
that
he
was
entitled
for
the
$144.60
as
wages.
and
your
suggestion
is
there
was
some
evidence
upon
of
which
a
jury
can
make
that
finding
and
thus
find
that
there
was
--
a
release
was
not
supported
by
consideration,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
on
this
last
point
mr.
blanchard,
i
notice
at
page
31,
this
is
not
a
complete
transcript,
isn't
it,
it's
just
a
narrative
point
of
transcript.
is
the
evidence
that
you
suggest
presented
the
jury
question
that
which
here
under
redirect
examination
at
page
31,
“the
$144.60
that
i
receive
there
from
mr.
mcallister
there
was
not
for
injuries
that
was
my
pay
check.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
but
that's
question
is
not
before
us
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
your
point
i
gather
is
this,
even
--
for
its
time
off
he
would
not
have
been
paid
any
wages
compensation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
but
that
--
in
order
to
give
him
that
--
that
he
would
execute
a
release,
the
company
was
willing
to
pay
him
the
equivalent
of
what
would
have
been
his
wages
if
he
had
worked.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you're
pointing
this
out
as
an
effect
that
admission
of
his
is
that
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
also
says
that
--
still
that
i
--
i
thought
they
were
paying
you
while
you
were
out.
in
other
words,
he's
taking
the
position
that
--
his
understanding
was
that
even
though
he
was
off
hurt,
he'd
be
compensated
for
this
time
--
at
the
wages
he
would
have
received,
had
been
working
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
we
were
not
on
the
fraud
issue
in
the
colloquy
you
and
i
have
had,
we're
talking
only
that
federal
consideration,
lack
of
consideration.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
aren't
the
questions
here,
one
is
fraud
and
the
other
is
lack
of
consideration.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
consideration,
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
they're
separate
issues
as
i
understand.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
either
should
have
gone
to
the
jury,
then
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
was
in
error
was
it?
