mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
action
was
brought
in
the
north
carolina
state
court
by
the
railroad
employee,
maynard
against
his
employer,
the
durham
southern
railway
company
under
the
provisions
of
the
federal
employer's
liability
act,
growing
out
of
injuries
which
he
received
on
august
22nd,
1955.
the
case
came
on
for
trail
in
the
wake
county
superior
court
in
april
1959,
the
superior
court
being
north
carolina's
(inaudible)
highest
court.
railroad's
motion
of
a
nonsuit
was
granted
at
the
end
of
all
of
the
evidence,
without
the
juries
having
the
opportunity
of
passing
on
any
of
the
issues.
the
supreme
court
on
appeal,
affirmed
the
superior
court
with
one
justice
dissenting.
thereafter
this
--
the
united
states
supreme
court
granted
the
writ
on
27
june,
1960.
the
petitioner
was
seriously
injured
while
assisting
in
loading
of
one
of
the
railroad's
motor
trucks.
in
bar
a
petitioner's
rights,
the
railroad
pleaded
and
offered
evidence
of
a
release
signed
by
the
petitioner.
plaintiff
or
petitioner
attacks
the
validity
and
did
attack
the
validity
below
of
the
purported
release
on
two
grounds,
one
that
it
was
unsupported
by
any
consideration
whatsoever
and
its
execution
was
procured
by
fraud,
misrepresentation
and
undue
influence.
now,
to
please
court,
since
the
railroad
conceded
in
open
court
in
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
that
--
probably
the
evidence
offered
by
the
petitioner,
was
sufficient
to
take
the
case
to
the
jury
on
the
issue
of
negligence,
it
would
appear
unnecessary
for
me
to
take
the
court's
time
in
reciting
the
minute
details
of
how
the
plaintiff's
serious
injuries
occurred
during
the
loading
of
the
truck.
with
that
background,
let
us
consider
the
evidence
most
favorable
to
the
petitioner
in
respect
to
the
execution
of
the
release,
itself.
following
his
injury,
the
petitioner
was
off
his
job
for
approximate
two
weeks
and
was
required
to
see
several
doctors,
before
he
was
able
to
return
to
work
around
the
middle
of
september
1955.
thereafter,
on
saturday,
september
17,
1955,
petitioner
went
to
the
office
of
the
defendant
railroad's
general
manager
to
get
his
pay
check.
the
petitioner
produced
evidence,
that
on
this
date
the
defendant
railroad
owed
him
a
$144.60
for
back
wages.
there
were
two
men
in
the
office,
the
general
manager
these
being
the
petitioner
and
the
general
manager
and
no
others.
when
the
petitioner
requested
his
pay
check,
the
general
manager
took
a
piece
of
paper
from
the
desk
drawer
and
keeping
it
partially
covered
with
his
hand,
pushed
it
across
the
desk
for
petitioner
and
told
petitioner
to
sign.
he
didn't
take
his
hand
off
to
the
paper
testified
the
petitioner,
i
remember
very
distinctly
that
mr.
mcallister
kept
his
hand
on
it,
he
further
testified.
he
also
testified
that
he
was
not
even
given
a
chance
to
read
this
paper.
petitioner
thought
that
he
was
signing
for
his
pay
check
and
so
he
testified
and
he
testified
he
ordinarily
received
his
pay
check
on
the
saturday
and
this
being
--
this
was
also
saturday.
he
would
not
have
signed
the
paper
had
he
known
it
was
a
release
and
that
he
had
never
been
paid
anything
--
he
had
never
been
paid
anything
for
his
injuries
we
--
when
he
signed
what
he
thought
was
a
receipt.
now,
the
petitioner
urges
that
under
this
evidence,
there
were
two
jury
questions,
it's
properly
two
jury
questions,
one,
the
question
of
fraud
whether
it
was
procured
by
fraud
and
second
was
there
complete
lack
of
consideration
as
alleged.
in
doing
so,
making
these
contentions,
the
petitioner
does
not
rely
only
on
evidentiary
or
factual
propositions.
we
feel
that
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
simply
misinterpreted
or
ignored
the
vast
federal
questions
and
authorities
on
the
subject
of
releases.
first,
as
to
fraud,
dice
versus
akron,
canton
&
youngstown
railroad
are
considered
at
this
court
in
342
u.s.
1952,
seems
to
be
and
appears
to
be
the
leading
case
in
the
last
time
this
court
has
considered
the
question
of
releases
and
the
--
and
the
fraud
in
the
procurement
of
releases
under
the
federal
employers
liability
act.
there,
the
petitioner
alleged
that
he
was
owed
$900
by
the
railroad
and
he
went
to
get
his
pay
check
and
the
railroad
told
him,
he
was
merely
signing
a
receipt,
turned
out
to
be
a
release
from
liability
for
personal
injuries.
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
yes
your
honor,
the
court
did
say
that
there
--
that
there
was
deliberate
false
statements
made
to
deceive
and
which
did
deceive
in
that
case.
here,
in
the
principal
case,
we
have
false
and
deceptive
silence
made
to
deceive
and
which
did
deceive.
we
have
a
situation
where
the
general
manager
knew
the
plaintiff
had
been
hurt,
he'd
come
for
his
pay
check,
he
kept
the
so-called
release
partially
covered
with
his
hand
during
the
interview
in
which
they
were
alone
and
it
knows
--
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
your
honor,
we
feel
that
it's
more
than
that,
the
--
we
feel
that
the
north
carolina
court
misinterpreted
all
of
the
federal
authority
apparently
and
while
they
didn't
specifically
said,
apparently,
they
felt
that
the
federal
authorities
require
affirmative
statements
--
false
statements
or
require
some
deliberate
act
of
fraud
and
since
there
were
no
affirmative
misstatements
in
this
case,
we
feel
that
they
let
it
go
off
on
that
and
that
tenure,
but
missing
--
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
your
honor,
we
feel
it's
more
than
that.
we
feel
that
they
ignored
the
federal
authorities.
we'd
say
that
there
does
not
have
to
be
affirmative
fraud.
there
can
be
fraud
by
silence
and
by
actions,
rather
than
affirmative,
deliberate
fraud
and
in
that
respect
we
say,
they
ignored
the
federal
authorities.
they
did
not
consider
for
instance,
the
purvis
versus
pennsylvania
case,
decided
by
the
third
circuit,
the
same
year
as
dice,
but
following
dice
and
it
is
based
on
dice.
we
feel
in
that
case
the
further
--
the
purvis
case
the
facts
are
as
close
to
being
on
all
force
as
this
case
as
any
case
can
be.
there,
there
was
no
deliberate,
no
affirmative
misstatement
of
facts,
it
was
simply
the
actions
and
the
silence
to
the
railroad
which
--
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
now
--
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
yes,
your
honor.
may
i
ask
--
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
both
issues
--
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
now,
as
--
as
to
lack
of
consideration,
plaintiff
clearly
gives
the
evidence
that
he
was
owing
at
the
time
of
the
execution
of
this
release,
they
owed
him
a
$144.60.
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
never
treated
total
lack
of
consideration
in
its
opinion.
on
the
inadequacy
of
consideration
did
they
discuss
in
their
opinion,
which
is
of
course
in
the
record.
they
said,
near
inadequacy
or
consideration
alone,
is
insufficient
and
cited
only
to
an
immediate
state
court
cases.
they
cited
the
nevada's
case
and
the
william's
case
and
intermediate
cases
in
illinois,
missouri
as
authority
for
that
holding
and
at
no
time
did
they
consider
the
complete
lack
of
consideration
and
in
our
brief,
we
have
the
burns
case
coming
out
of
the
eight
circuit
and
the
hogue
case
from
a
certain
district
court
which
reasonably
and
logically,
we
say
require
that
a
release
be
supported
by
some
consideration
and
when
its
not
supported
by
any
consideration,
its
nullity.
therefore,
--
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
yes,
your
honor.
we
feel
that
north
carolina
has
just
decided
the
federal
question
of
substance
not
in
accord
with
decisions
of
this
and
other
federal
courts
and
that
is
not
merely
an
evidentiary
or
factual
proposition
before
this
court
in
this
case.
and
that
if
the
case
is
permitted
to
stay,
it
will
become
authority
for
other
erroneous
state
decisions
under
the
federal
employers
liability
act.
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
he
dissented,
but
he
did
not
write
a
(voice
overlap)
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
that's
one
of
the
places
in
record,
which
we
complain
of
and
there
are
two
or
three
others,
your
honor.
one
on
page
21,
“i
thought
i
had
to
sign
for
my
pay
check,
at
that
time
the
railroad
owed
me
$144.65
for
labor
--
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
21.
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
i
never
received
anything
from
the
railroad
as
a
result
from
the
injury
which
i
have
described
here
today
and
there
--
there's
i
think,
on
page
26
of
the
transcript
a
similar
statement.
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
in
respect
to
$144.60
which
the
petitioner
states
was
due
him,
the
defendant
railroad,
never
offered
any
evidence
to
the
effect
that
petitioner
was
not
entitled
to
the
$144.60.
there
our
main
witness,
mr.
mcallister,
never
testified
that
the
man
was
not
due
$144.60
for
labor.
all
the
general
manager
testified
to
about
this,
was
that
he
told
the
petitioner,
“it
would
be
necessary
for
him
sign
a
release
before
settling
up.”
so,
you
--
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
record
45,
your
honor.
so
you
would
think
that
if
a
--
they
--
are
we
really
going
to
make
a
lot
about
this
$144.60
not
being
used
to
the
petitioner,
they
would
put
on
some
evidence
themselves.
now,
in
respect
to
our
own
witness,
what
he
had
to
say
about
the
policy
of
the
railroad.
i
want
to
say
first
this
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
petitioner
ever
knew
about
any
so-called
policy
or
that
this
witness
ever
informed
the
petitioner
about
this
so-called
policy.
all
that
that
witness
which
has
been
referred
to
and
testified
to
him,
was
that
--
was
on
page
34
as
follows.
i
know
that
the
policy
of
the
company
that
--
was
that,
when
anyone
had
been
off
and
had
come
back
to
work,
they
did
not
get
their
wages
unless
they
sign
the
release.
i
knew
that
--
i
knew
that
was
the
policy
of
the
durham
&
southern
railway
company,
ever
since
i
have
known
anything
about
it.
that
is,
you
don't
get
your
wages
when
you
have
been
off
from
work,
unless
you
sign
a
release,
didn't
say
anything
about
injuries
there,
but
then
it
goes
down
to
next
paragraph
as
so,
likewise
if
a
man
is
injured
he
is
called
upon
to
sign
a
release
when
he
gets
his
money.
never
--
this
witness
which
they
tried
to
establish
the
policy
of
that,
never
said
that
this
release
is
required.
he
uses
the
word,
is
called
upon.
that
i
think
is
synonymous
with
asked
to
sign
a
release,
but
even
that
witness
which
they
may
so
much
to
do
about,
never
said
that
it
was
necessary
to
sign
a
release
before
getting
his
money.
and
finally,
we
say
that
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
never
considered
the
subject
of
lack
of
consideration
--
of
--
of
total
lack
of
consideration.
no
way
in
the
decision
can
i
see
that
--
that
point
was
even
considered
by
the
court
and
we
say
that
there
in
particular,
did
they
ignore
the
federal
authorities
in
never
discussing
the
complete
lack
of
consideration.
they
did
discuss
inadequacy
of
consideration
at
some
--
at
some
length
and
cited
particularly,
the
(inaudible)
and
williams
cases,
the
two
state
intermediate
cases,
which
dealt
entirely
within
adequacy
of
consideration.
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
your
honor
--
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
i
--
i
do
not
believe
further
pleadings
were
filed
following
a
reply,
i'm
sure
they
were
not.
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
that's
our
opinion,
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
i
think,
your
honor,
it's
deemed
denied.
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
your
honor,
we
--
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
he
pointed
to
our
own
witnesses
on
cross-examination
and
is
called
by
name
of
bailey,
but
they
themselves,
never
offered
any
evidence
that
the
wages
were
not
due
to
this
petitioner.
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
in
--
in
my
opinion,
yes,
justice
black.
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
justice
black
the
only
thing
about
that
was
the
evidence
of
-
of
dues
from
my
own
witness
bailey
and
they
never
offered
any
evidence
about
the
policy
of
the
railroad,
but
i
used
bailey
to
show
what
the
policy
was
about
a
man
when
he
was
off,
but
they
did
not
specify
about
a
man
who
was
injured.
now,
being
off,
that
could
apply
to
somebody
who
just
quit
or
decided
did
--
did
not
want
to
work
for
two
or
three
weeks,
but
that
was
the
only
thing
--
bailey
was
the
only
witness
to
discuss
that
point
and
he
was
the
petitioner's
witness.
mr.
charles
f.
blanchard
well
he
was
petitioner's
witness
and
they
took
him
on
cross-examination
to
establish
what
the
so-called
policy
was,
but
never
offered
any
evidence
themselves
on
that
point.
