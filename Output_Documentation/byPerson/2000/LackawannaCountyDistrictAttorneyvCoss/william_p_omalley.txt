mr.
william
p.
o'malley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
essentially
involved
in
this
case
is
the
failure
of
the
third
circuit
court
to
apply
the
rationale
espoused
by
this
court
in
custis
v.
united
states,
to
conclude
that
constitutional
deprivations
other
than
deprivation
of
the
right
to
counsel
can
be
addressed
in
habeas
corpus
proceedings
as
constituting
a
collateral
effect
enhancing
the
sentence
of
someone
in
custody
under
a
conviction
that
they
are
seeking
to
attack
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
in
this
case,
edward
coss
had
been
convicted
in
the
mid-eighties
of
simple
assault
and
institutional
vandalism
and
had
been
sentenced
to
incarceration,
and
he
had
completely
served
his
sentence.
