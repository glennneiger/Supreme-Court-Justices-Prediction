justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now
the
second
case
is
lackawanna
county
district
attorney
versus
coss,
and
it
comes
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit,
and
it
has
a
resemblance
to
the
case
just
announced.
this
is
the
state
analogue
of
the
daniel’s
opinion
which
i
just
described.
in
that
case
as
i
explained
we
delth
with
challenges
to
federal
sentences
enhanced
by
allegedly
unconstitutional
prior
convictions.
in
this
lackawanna
case,
we
deal
with
challenges
to
state
criminal
sentences
enhanced
by
allegedly
unconstitutional
prior
state
convictions.
in
1986
mr.
coss
was
convicted
in
pennsylvania
state
court
of
assault,
vandalism,
and
criminal
mischief.
he
filed
a
petition
for
state
postconviction
relief
alleging
that
those
convictions
were
the
product
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
the
pennsylvania
courts
never
ruled
on
his
petition
and
he
served
his
full
sentence
on
those
offences.
in
1990,
coss
was
again
convicted
in
state
court,
this
time
of
aggravated
assault.
taking
under
consideration
his
extensive
criminal
record
of
which
his
1986
convictions
are
a
small
part,
the
state
court
sentenced
coss
to
six
to
twelve
years
imprison.
coss
then
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
under
28
u.s.c
section
2254
in
federal
court,
claiming
that
his
1986
convictions
were
the
product
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
and
that
he
was
in
custody
in
violation
of
a
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
petitioner,
the
lackawanna
county
district
attorney
and
the
court,
understood
coss
to
be
arguing
that
his
sentence
for
that
1990
crime
was
adversely
affected
by
his
earlier
1986
state
convictions.
the
district
court
held
that
it
had
jurisdiction
but
it
denied
the
petition
finding
that
coss
had
not
been
prejudiced
by
his
1986
counsel’s
ineffectiveness.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
agreed
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
but
remanded
upon
finding
that
but
for
his
counsel’s
ineffectiveness
he
would
not
have
been
convicted
in
1986.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit.
coss
does
satisfy
the
in
custody
requirement
for
habeas
petitioners
because
he
is
challenging
the
sentence
is
currently
serving
for
his
1990
conviction.
we
have
not
previously
determined
the
extent
to
which
a
prior
conviction
used
to
enhance
a
subsequent
state
court
sentence
maybe
subject
to
challenge
in
an
attack
on
the
enhanced
sentence.
we
extend
our
holding
in
daniel’s
which
was
announced
this
morning
to
the
section
2254
context
and
for
the
reasons
stated
in
that
opinion,
we
hold
once
a
state
conviction
is
no
longer
open
to
direct
or
collateral
attack
in
its
own
right
because
the
defendant
failed
to
pursue
those
remedies
when
they
were
available
or
because
he
did
so
unsuccessfully,
that
conviction
is
conclusively
valid.
if
that
conviction
is
then
used
to
enhance
a
subsequence
state
sentence,
the
previous
state
conviction
may
not
be
collaterally
attacked
through
a
secton
2254
petition
directed
at
the
enhanced
sentence.
as
in
daniel’s
we
recognized
an
exception
to
this
general
rule
where
the
prior
conviction
was
obtained
for
failure
to
appoint
counsel.
justice
scalia
has
joined
all
but
parts
3b
and
3c
of
the
opinion;
justice
thomas
has
joined
all
but
part
3b;
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
stevens
and
justice
ginsberg
have
joined;
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
