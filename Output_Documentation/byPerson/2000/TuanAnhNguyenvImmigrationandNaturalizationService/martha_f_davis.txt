ms.
martha
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
raises
the
question
of
whether
differential
treatment
of
mothers
and
fathers
under
federal
citizenship
law
violates
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
joseph
boulais
has
raised
his
out
of
wedlock
son
from
infancy.
under
8
usc
section
1409,
an
out
of
wedlock
mother
of
a
foreign-born
child
can
establish
her
child's
citizenship
at
birth
upon
proof
of
three
things:
u.s.
nationality
at
the
time
of
the
child's
birth,
parentage
of
the
child,
and
prior
physical
presence
in
the
united
states.
joseph
boulais
meets
all
of
these
criteria.
however,
solely
because
he's
the
male
parent,
the
law
imposes
two
additional
criteria.
first,
mr.
boulais,
as
a
father,
must
produce
a
signed
statement
that
he
will
support
the
child
until
his
18th
birthday.
the
father
here
supported
his
son,
but
he
never
signed
a
statement.
second,
the
father
must
before
his
child's
18th
birthday,
either
legitimate,
adjudicate
paternity
or
formally
acknowledge
paternity,
and
here
the
father
has
formally
acknowledged
paternity,
but
not
until
his
son
was
in
his
20s.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
justice
o'connor,
this
is
a
facial
challenge.
we
do
not
believe
there
is
any
constitutional
basis
on
which
this
statute
could
be
applied
to
individuals.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
your
honor,
the
fiallo
case
concerns
the
situation
of
some
individuals
who
are
citizens
applying
for
special
immigration
preferences
for
children
of
those
citizens
or
relatives
of
those
citizens.
the
court
here
ruled
that
that
was
covered
by
the
plenary
power.
here
the
issue
concerns
only
citizens
applying
for
trying
to
transmit
citizenship
at
birth,
benefits
to...
to
parents,
and
so
the
difference
is
the
question
of
what
the
extent
of
plenary
power
is.
and
we
believe
that
plenary
power
should
stop,
at
the
very
least,
before
it
reaches
a
situation
where
a
citizen,
here
mr.
boulais,
is
seeking
to
transmit
citizenship
benefits
to
a
child
who,
as
the
statute
indicates,
once
citizenship
is
recognized
will
relate
back
to
the
date
of
birth.
so
i
guess
there
are
two
basic
distinctions.
one,
that
there's
a
relation
back
issue,
so
the
citizen's
child...
the
child
here,
once
his
citizenship
is
recognized,
will
have
been
deemed
to
have
been
a
citizen
from
birth,
and
therefore
there
isn't
any
of
the
concern
about
transfer
of
allegiances
that's
the
case
in
naturalization
or
also
potentially
the
case
in
immigration
sorts
of
situations.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
as
soon
as
those
conditions
are
met,
then
his
citizenship
is
recognized
at
the
time
of
birth.
that's
recognized
under
statute--
ms.
martha
f.
davis
--and
once
his
citizenship
is
recognized,
he
will
be
deemed
to
have
been
a
dual
citizen
of
the
country
from
the
date
of
birth,
but
the
statute
itself
recognizes
that
there
isn't
a
transfer
of
allegiances
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
there
isn't
an
oath
of
allegiance
that's
required
for,
to
establish
citizenship
at
birth,
unlike
naturalization,
where
that's
a
substantive
requirement
of
the...
of
the
recognition
of
the
status.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
not
at
all,
your
honor.
what
we're
saying
is
the
immigration
statute
makes
a
distinction
between
citizenship
at
birth
and
other
forms
of
immigration
status,
and
that
because
of
that
distinction,
the
plenary
power
that
shields
in
some
instances
immigration
actions
from
full
constitutional
review
should
not
apply
here.
it
should
stop
short
of
barring
full
constitutional
review
or
ordinary
constitutional
review
of
transmission
of
citizenship
from
a
citizen
to
a
plenary
citizen.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
justice
kennedy--
ms.
martha
f.
davis
--yes.
justice
kennedy,
this
court
has
never
extended
plenary
power
to
every
statute
that
potentially
implicates
foreign
relations.
there's
only...
there
are
many,
many
that
do
that,
including
child
support
and
environmental
laws.
this
court
has
also
never
extended
plenary
power
to
every
action
under
even
the
immigration
nationality
act
in
ins
versus
chadha,
for
example.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
the
rationale
that
this
court
has
offered
is
the
idea
that
foreign
relations
is
directly
implicated,
i
presume
in
part
because
of
this
transfer
of
allegiances.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
your
honor,
then
they
would
be
in
the
same
category
as
the
citizens
here.
they
would
have
been
citizens
from
birth.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
your
honor,
here
what
we
base
our
argument
on
is
the
structure
of
the
statute
as
well
as
the
long
history
of
jus
sanguinis
citizenship,
and
this
court's
ruling
in
rogers
versus
bellei
which
also
indicated
that
citizenship
at
birth
was
subject
to
ordinary
constitutional
scrutiny,
even
though
there
isn't
a
right
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
that
citizenship,
even
though
congress
could
change
the
rules
of
citizenship
tomorrow,
still
the
statute
itself,
the
history
of
jus
sanguinis
citizenship
and
this
court's
construction
of
that,
of
that
law
in
rogers
versus
bellei
we
believe
supports
limiting
the
extension
of
plenary
power
authority
to
a
situation
where
a
citizen
here
is
seeking
to
transmit
citizenship
to
his
child
who
will
be
a
citizen
at
birth
at
the
time
that
citizenship
is
recognized.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
your
honor,
i
guess
i'm--
ms.
martha
f.
davis
--yes,
your
honor,
it
is
naturalization
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitutional
naturalization
clause.
however,
congress,
in
implementing
that
clause,
has
made
choices
about
how
to
implement
it
that
we
believe--
ms.
martha
f.
davis
--that
we
believe
implicate
the
extent
of
the
plenary
power.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
that's...
that's
correct.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
your
honor,
i
mean,
we
certainly
wouldn't
be
able
to
argue
that
the
transfer
of
allegiances
and
those
issues
no
longer
implicated
foreign
relations,
and
that's
a
critical
part
of
our
argument
here.
let
me
turn--
ms.
martha
f.
davis
--your
honor--
ms.
martha
f.
davis
--your
honor,
this
court
has
held
in
the
past,
most
notably
in
rogers
versus
bellei,
that
the
authority
to
grant
citizenship
at
birth,
jus
sanguinis
citizenship,
derives
from
the
naturalization
clause.
now,
whether
in
the
absence
of
that
clause
congress
could
still
go
forward
i
don't
know
because
we,
you
know...
the
court
hasn't
had
to
confront
that
issue.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
depend
upon
what
the
term
naturalization
meant
even
at
that
time.
we
know
what
it
means
now
because
congress
itself
has
defined
it
in
the
statute
to
apply
only
to
those
individuals
who
have
citizenship
that
is
prospective
only,
and
here
mr.
boulais
and
his
son
come
forward
with
a
claim
for
citizenship
that
relates
back
to
birth,
so
it's
clearly
not
in
the
same
category
as
naturalization
is
defined
under
the
current
statute.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
that's
correct,
but
in
implementing--
ms.
martha
f.
davis
--your
honor,
we
don't
believe
that
fiallo
must
be
reversed
in
order
to
rule
in
our
favor
because
of
the
distinction
that
we
just
discussed.
however,
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief,
there
are
reasons
to
reassess
fiallo,
given,
in
particular,
the
subsequent
development
of
equal
protection
law
that
might
suggest
that
the
result
in
that
case
is
one
that
the
court
would
no
longer--
ms.
martha
f.
davis
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
yes,
because
it
retains
the
sex
based
classifications.
of
course,
there
the
congress
was
not
responding
to
a
finding
on
constitutionality,
so
they
weren't
bound
by
that
kind
of
a
ruling.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
your
honor,
we
don't
quarrel
with
the
construction
that
rogers
versus
bellei
adopted,
which
is
that
citizenship
at
birth
is
a
form
of
naturalization.
however
what
we
argue
is
that
the
congress
in
implementing
that
power
has
made
a
distinction
between
naturalization
under
the
statute
and
citizenship
at
birth
under
the
statute,
and
the
implications
of
that
distinction
are
that
the
plenary
power
of
congress
to
regulate
immigration
does
not
extend
to
citizenship
at
birth
because
citizenship
at
birth
relates
back
to
the
date
of
birth
because
naturalization
is
defined
to
be
prospective
only
because
there
isn't
a
requirement
of
an
oath
of
allegiance
in
order
to
have
citizenship
at
birth
acknowledged.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
person
would
be
covered
in
the
same
way
that
those
citizens
concerned
in
afroyim
and
those
cases
whereby
the
constitution
for
denaturalization
purposes,
that
person
could
have
additional
conditions
placed
on
citizenship
that
would
not
be
appropriate
for
a
jus
soli
citizen.
or...
yes,
for
a
jus
soli
citizen.
so,
for
example,
the
conditions
placed
on
the
individual
in
rogers
versus
bellei,
who
was
a
citizen
at
birth,
the
residency
conditions
are
permissible
under
the
constitution
even
though
if
those
conditions
are
not
filled,
the
individual
will
lose
citizenship
at
the
time
that
they
fail
to
comply
with
those
conditions.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
if
the
child
of
the
american?
ms.
martha
f.
davis
your
honor,
no,
our
argument
would
not
be
different.
i'm
raising
that
because
it's
an
indication
of
the
fact
that
congress--
ms.
martha
f.
davis
--yes.
no,
your
honor,
our
argument
doesn't
hinge
entirely
on
that,
no,
but
i
raise
that--
ms.
martha
f.
davis
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
argument
that
i'm
making
reflects
the
construction
of
the
statute.
the
statute
itself
makes
a
distinction
between
citizenship
and
citizenship
at
birth
and
naturalization.
it
lists
in
the
section
1401
jus
soli
citizenship
along
with
citizenship
at
birth.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
yes,
justice
scalia,
the
issue
is
the
extent
of
the
plenary
power
doctrine,
which
this
court
has,
as
i
suggested
earlier,
has
not
always
applied
in
the
immigration
area,
and
we
believe
that--
ms.
martha
f.
davis
--that...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
applying
it
to
citizens
and
citizens
at
birth,
would
extend
the
plenary
power
doctrine
beyond
where
it
has
ever
been
extended
in
the...
in
the
past.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
right.
well,
in
fact,
your
honor,
you
mentioned
natural
born
citizen,
and
many
commentators
believe
that
citizens
at
birth
are
deemed
to
be
natural
born
citizens,
so
this
is
a
category
of
citizenship
that
traditionally
has
had
a
different
status
than
naturalized
citizenship
for
many,
many
years,
for
centuries.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
president,
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
that's
correct,
your
honor.
however,
the
statute,
the
immigration
and
naturalization
statute,
treats
those
jus
soli
citizenship...
citizens
and
citizens
at
birth
in
the
same
section,
so
they
clearly
are
contemplating
that
many
of
the
same
protections
are
going
to
apply
to
those
citizens.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
that's
correct.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
your
honor,
there...
according
to
the
remedy
that
we've
proposed,
there
would
still
be
some
criteria
to
be
met,
yes,
but
the
remedy--
ms.
martha
f.
davis
--a
mother
currently
can
sponsor
a
child,
transmit
citizenship
at
any
time
during
the
child's
life.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
our
argument
is
that
a
father,
that--
ms.
martha
f.
davis
--should
have
the
same
right,
the
remedy
that
this
court
should
impose
should
be
one
that
gives
the--
ms.
martha
f.
davis
--what
this
court
has
indicated,
both
in
rogers
v.
bellei
and
also
in
a
majority
of
the
justices
in
the
miller
case--
ms.
martha
f.
davis
--stated
that
it's
recognition
of
existing
citizenship
and
continuing
citizenship.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
your
honor,
that
would
remedy
the
equal
protection
issue,
but
we
believe
that
it
would
run
contrary
to
what
we
know
about
the
court's
principles
in
crafting
a
remedy.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
we
have
not
been
able
to
find
a
case
where
there
has
been
equalization
down,
as
you
say.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
certainly.
i
mean,
our
position
is
that
they
need
to
meet
the
heightened
scrutiny
standard.
but
even--
ms.
martha
f.
davis
--sure.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not...
well,
to
start
out,
we
believe
that
that
issue
is
not
properly
in
the
case
because
we
haven't
challenged
the
physical
presence
requirements
here,
and
the
government
as
well
as
congress
have
indicated
that
the
way
they
have
dealt
with
statelessness,
concerns
about
statelessness
is
to
have
differential
physical
presence
requirements
for
mothers
and
fathers.
mr.
boulais
doesn't
have
standing
to
challenge
those.
he
meets
both
those
physical
presence
requirements.
if
the
remedy
that
we
seek
is
imposed,
those
physical
presence
requirements
will
remain
and
will
continue
to
do
the
job
that
the
government
says
they
are
needed
for
in
terms
of
addressing
the
potential
for
statelessness,
but
even
beyond
that,
even
assuming
that
it
is
in
the
case,
the
risk
of
statelessness
is
not
gender
specific.
the...
there
are
a
number
of
nations
that...
and
this
is
set
out
in
the
equality
now
amicus
brief
which
was
submitted
to
the
court,
there
are
a
number
of
countries
which
have
laws
that
are
gender
neutral
so
that
there
isn't
any
greater
risk
of
statelessness
for
children
of
mothers
than
there
is
of
fathers.
some
of
those
laws
are
avail--
ms.
martha
f.
davis
--there
are
some
nations
that
are
not
at
that
level.
there
are
some
nations
where
there's
a
greater
risk
of
statelessness
for
children
of
fathers,
and
those
children
are
currently
not
getting
the
benefit
of
the
generous
physical
presence
requirements.
for
example,
canada
has
a
provision
that
says
that
if
a
child
is
born
abroad
and
doesn't
maintain
connections
with
canada
that
they
will
lose
their
citizenship
by
age
28.
well,
by
age
28,
the
child
of
a
u.s.
father,
the
father
can
no
longer
transmit
the
citizenship
to
the
child,
so
in
fact
that
child
of
u.s.
father
is
at
much
greater
risk
of
statelessness
than
a
child
of
a
u.s.
mother
who
had
a
child
with
a
canadian
citizen
abroad.
so
the
government
could
much
better
address
its
concerns
about
statelessness
by
either
having
a
more
generous
physical
presence
requirements
across
the
board
because
it's...
any
requirement
increases
the
risk
of
statelessness,
so
it
could
have
more
generous
require...
more
generous
provisions
across
the
board
or
it
could
have
one
that's
tailored
to
the
specific
countries
where
statelessness
is
at
issue
for
mothers
or
for
fathers
instead
of--
ms.
martha
f.
davis
--exactly
right.
i
mean,
the
remedy
that
we
seek...
the
court
would
have
to
go
beyond
the
four
corners
of
the
complaint
or
of
the
issue
here,
the
case
here
in
order
to
address
the
physical
presence
requirements.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
and
as
i
said,
in
fact,
may
increase
the
risk
of
statelessness
because
any
barrier
that's
placed
on
transmittal
of
citizenship
increases
the
risk
of
statelessness,
especially
absolute
cutoff
at
age
18.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
i'm
sorry,
the
children
of
parents
born
abroad
are
naturalized?
ms.
martha
f.
davis
yes.
your
honor,
the
wording
of
the
constitution
is
natural
born
citizens
for
purposes
of
being
president
or
vice
president.
and
what...
i
haven't
done
the
research
myself.
what
commentators
say
is
that
natural
born
is
the
equivalent
of...
includes,
encompasses
jus
soli
and
jus
sanguinis.
but
that's
a
different
term
than
naturalized.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
that's
correct.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
your
honor,
i
guess
the
question
is
whether
the
term
naturalized
in
the
constitution
also
encompasses
natural
born
citizens.
in
rogers
versus
bellei
suggested
that
it
did.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
i
think
it's...
i
think
it's
totally
clear
that
jus
sanguinis
citizenship
has
a
different
history
than
naturalized
citizenship
and
has
traditionally
by
this
court
as
well
as
by
congress
been
treated
differently.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
yes,
by
the
same
token--
ms.
martha
f.
davis
--by
the
same
token,
one
could
say
that
the
provision
would
apply
now
to
ensure
that
congress
can't
apply
suspect
classifications
to
keep
certain
individuals
from
aspiring
to
those
offices.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
no,
your
honor,
i
do
disagree
with
that.
i
believe
that
it
encompasses
jus
sanguinis
citizenship.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
is
a
debate
over
it,
that's
correct--
ms.
martha
f.
davis
--whether
he
can
be
vice
president.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
to
return
to
that
issue
briefly,
i
want
to
make
sure
that
the
court
understands
that
applying
heightened
scrutiny
does
not
mean
that
the
government
then
does
not
get
to
make
its
case,
that
the
concerns
about
dual
citizenship
or
concerns
about
statelessness
might
meet
heightened
scrutiny.
they
can
still
come
forward
and
in
those
unusual
instances
where
they
can
establish
that
they
meet
that
standard,
apply
classifications
that
would
otherwise
be
suspect.
we
believe
those
would
be
rare
cases,
but
it's
not
that
there
is
no
review.
what
it
means
is
simply
that
you're
saying,
or
that
the
citizens
transmitting
citizenship
would
be
able
to
invoke
the
same
constitutional
standards
as
are
usually
invoked.
i
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
martha
f.
davis
thank
you.
first,
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question
about
whether
or
not
any
bill
was
introduced
in
congress,
no,
there
was
not.
mr.
kneedler
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
talking
about
the
legal
relationship
which
he
asserts
is
automatically
established
at
the
time
of
birth
between
a
father
and
child.
in
fact,
as
this
court
knows,
that
to
the
extent
that
that
exists,
it's
a
legacy
of
coverture
and
common
law
discrimination
which
this
court
has
previously
condemned
in
frontiero
versus--
ms.
martha
f.
davis
--i'm
sorry?
ms.
martha
f.
davis
your
honor,
i
think
it
can
be
distinguished
from
this
case,
aside
from
my
view
of
its
propriety.
this...
in
lehr
versus
robertson
the
issue
required
the
state
to
decide
between
competing
parents,
and
to
do
that
quickly
because
of
the
emotional
trauma
involved
with
the
adoption.
here
there
isn't
any
need
to
create
a
hierarchy
between
parents,
any
need
to
create
those
kind
of
classifications
to
make
that
decision
proceed
quickly,
and
so
therefore,
the
government
interests
are
different--
ms.
martha
f.
davis
--right.
exactly,
your
honor.
and
so,
no,
i
don't
believe
that
a
ruling
in
our
favor
in
this
case
would
require
this
court
to
reassess
the
decision
in
lehr.
in
addition,
the
court
asked
about
the
question
of
the
numbers
that
would
be
involved
here,
and
there's
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
the
congress
has
been
concerned
about
that
in
looking
at
this
statute,
as
mr.
kneedler
just
indicated.
in
fact,
the
statute
has
progressively
gotten
more
liberal,
and
i
think
that
that
underscores
the
fact
that
in...
as
this
court
looks
at
the
intent
of
congress
in
crafting
a
remedy
that
the
court
should
take
into
account,
that
congress
has
progressively
gotten
more
liberal
in
addressing
this
issue.
most
recently
in
1986,
the
congress
eliminated
the...
or
reduced
the
ten
year
residency
requirement
down
to
five
years.
now,
that
had
presumably
a
significant
effect
on
the
additional
numbers
of
individuals
who
could
seek
transmission
of
citizenship
under
this
law.
yet,
there
was
no
mention
of
that
in
the
legislative
history
as
being
a
factor
that
was
influencing
in
any
way
congress'
view
of
this.
in
addition,
there
are
other
indicia
of
congress'
intent.
one
is
that
congress
has
itself
moved
away
from
this
notion--
