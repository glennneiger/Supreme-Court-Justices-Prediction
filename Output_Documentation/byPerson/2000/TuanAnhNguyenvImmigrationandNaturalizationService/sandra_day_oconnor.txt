miss
davis,
is
this
an
as-applied
or
a
facial
challenge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
you
deal
with
the
fiallo
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
is...
it
is
naturalization
in
the
broader
sense
of
referring
to
the
constitutional
authority?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
to
that
extent
i
think
it
makes
it
somewhat
difficult
to
distinguish
fiallo.
are
you
arguing
that
we
need
to
reverse
fiallo
if
necessary?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you've
heard
all
these
arguments
this
morning
that
this
isn't
a
case
of
naturalization
and
not
part
of
congress'
plenary
power
when
a
child
is
born
of
a
parent
that's
a
u.s.
citizen.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
concerned
that
your
time
will
expire
before
you've
addressed
either
point
that
may
be
critical
here...
the
application
of
fiallo
and
if
we
disagree
with
you
and
think
there's
some
equal
protection
problem,
what
about
the
remedy?
will
you
try
to
touch
on
both
of
those.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
the
statute
we're
considering
here
meet
heightened
scrutiny
to
think
that
applied?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
kneedler,
your
time
is
almost
up.
not
a
word
yet
about
remedy.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
know,
but
i
think
we
need
to
talk
about
it
briefly
if
we
could
in
any
time
remaining.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
have
a
severability
clause,
so--
