unknown
speaker
well,
wait.
why
is
there
no
problem
with
transfer
of
allegiances?
i
mean,
it's
fine
to
make
it
retroactive
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned,
but
that
doesn't
change
the
reality
of
it.
the
reality
of
it
is
he's
not
an
american
citizen
until
these
conditions
are...
are
met,
and
he's
proclaimed
to
be
such.
prior
to
that
he's
not
an
american
citizen,
is
he?
unknown
speaker
but
he
was
a
citizen
of
some
other
country
before
then.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
miss
davis,
you're
not
suggesting
that
there's
a
constitutional
right
to
have
your
citizenship
conferred
on
an
american,
the
child
of
an
american
parent
brought
abroad?
unknown
speaker
and
why...
to
say
that
plenary
power
stops
puzzles
me.
unknown
speaker
you
say...
you
say
fiallo
would
have
come
out
differently
if
these
aliens
were
not
only
admitted
but
having
been
once
they
are
admitted
are
proclaimed
to
have
been
american
citizens
from
birth?
that
would
wash
out
the
plenary
power
of
the
federal
government?
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
me.
if...
if...
if...
if
you
admit
them
without
making
them
citizens
from
birth,
you
have
plenary
power,
but
if
you
do
even
the
greater
thing,
admit
them
and
make
them
citizens
from
birth,
suddenly
your
plenary
power
disappears.
it
seems
to
me,
if
anything,
it
ought
to
be
the
opposite.
unknown
speaker
so
that
congress,
so
far
as
the
clause
is
concerned,
congress
could
do
this,
leaving
aside
equal
protection.
congress
can
do
this
if
it
simply
did
not
have
the
relation
back
provision?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
--so
what
is
this
to
do
with
naturalization?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
were
to
reexamine
fiallo,
i
suppose
under
your
view,
the
amendment
in
1986
to
the
statute
involved
in
fiallo
that
adopted
the
position
of
the
dissenters
in
fiallo
would
also
be
unconstitutional
because
it
basically
followed
the
same
pattern
as
this
statute
does.
unknown
speaker
has
precisely
the
same
right?
unknown
speaker
--well,
if
we
agreed
with
your
equal
protection
argument,
i
suppose
we
would
have
the
alternative
to
say
not
simply
that
the
father
is
pushed
into
the
same
favorable
position
as
the
mother,
but
the
mother
is
pushed
into
the
same
unfavorable
position
as
the
father.
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
always
a
first
time.
in
this
case
the
government's
argument,
the
stateless
person
problem,
takes
much
more
prominence
than
it
did
in
our
earlier
case,
and
that
would
seem
to
state
a
rational
basis
for
this
distinction.
would
you
comment
on
the
government's
argument
in
this
regard?
unknown
speaker
well,
and
i
think
it
might
meet
that
as
well,
but
would
you
comment
on
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
there
are
some
nations
that
are
not
in
that
classification,
are
there
not?
unknown
speaker
of
course
the
interesting
thing
about
that
provision,
it
requires
that
he
be
natural
born
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution.
that's
what
it
literally
says.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
when
you
say,
when
you
say
in
effect
that
all
citizens
are
treated
alike,
certainly
a
naturalized
citizen
in
the
nonargumentative
use,
someone
who
has
been
an
alien
and
comes
here,
can
have
his
citizenship
revoked.
unknown
speaker
so,
if
any...
may
i
ask
just
a
question.
are
there
any
statistics
anywhere
that
tell
us
the
size
of
either
of
the
classes
of
children
born
abroad
of
an
unmarried
female
parent
and
those
born
abroad
of
an
unmarried
male
parent?
do
we
have
any
idea
how
many
people
are
going
to
be
affected
by
this
decision?
unknown
speaker
that's
unquestionable,
isn't
it?
and
isn't
that
perhaps
one
of
the
reasons
behind
the
differentiation
in
this
statute?
there
are
large
populations
of
children
of
united
states
servicemen
in
the
far
east
and
in
germany,
and...
service
personnel.
and
i
expect
very
few
of
these
are
the
children
of
female
service
personnel.
unknown
speaker
all
they
have
to
do
is
say,
you
know,
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
person.
i
met
her
once,
and
that
was
it.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
we
were
assuming
it
was
not...
i
thought
we
were
assuming
with
modern
techniques
that
it's
very
easy
to
establish
the
relationship
now.
what
is
our
assumption,
it's
difficult
or
it's
easy?
unknown
speaker
in
many,
many
cases,
all
the
child
would
have
to
do
is
ask
his
mother.
unknown
speaker
and
on
that
point,
you
heard
obviously
the
colloquy
between
me
and
the
petitioner's
counsel.
petitioner's
counsel
indicates,
oh,
well,
there
are
statements,
problems
on
the
side
of
the
father,
too,
just
as
great.
unknown
speaker
but
all
goes
to,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
all
goes
to
matters
of
proof.
what
you're
pointing
out
is
that
it
would
be
much
easier
for
the
child
of
the
american
mother
to
prove
the
things
that
perhaps
we
would
all
agree
should
be
proven
if
citizenship
is
to
be
recognized,
but
i
don't
see
how
it
goes
to
the
justification
of
the
differential
standards.
unknown
speaker
why
before
18?
1986.
unknown
speaker
either
way.
unknown
speaker
we
do
that
even
domestically,
don't
we?
i
mean,
we
do
not
treat
biological
fathers
as
necessarily
having
any
rights,
whereas
we
do
treat
biological
mothers
as
having
rights
from
the
outset.
unknown
speaker
well,
he's
had
no
choice
with
all
the--
unknown
speaker
suppose
we
think
there
is
an
equal
protection
problem
and
remedy
has
to
be
addressed.
unknown
speaker
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-2071,
tuan
nguyen
versus
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
