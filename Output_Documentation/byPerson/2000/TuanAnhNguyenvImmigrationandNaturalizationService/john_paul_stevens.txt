justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
clarify
one
thing?
your
view
is
the
statute
is
invalid
on
its
face,
which,
as
i
take
it,
means
that
the
requirements
as
to
the
children
of
female
parents
have
to
be
applied
in
the
same
way
to
children
of
male
american
citizen
parents
born
abroad?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
anyone
anywhere
in
the
world
at
any
time
can
prove
that
his
parent,
his
father
was
an
american
citizen,
has
been
a
citizen
since
that
person's
birth,
even
if
it
was
60
years
ago?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay,
criteria
other
than
those
applied
to
children
of
mother...
of
mother...
whose
mother
was
an
american
citizen.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
doesn't
have
the
right.
it's
whether
he
has...
he
has
already
done
it,
merely
by
virtue
of
being
a
citizen
and
by
having
lived
in
the
united
states
for
a
certain
period
of
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
your
position
is
all
i
wanted
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
just
one
brief
question.
after
our
decision
in
miller
against
albright,
did
anyone
in
congress
raise
this
issue
for
further
consideration,
to
your
knowledge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
lehr
against
robertson
was
correctly
decided?
justice
john
