mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
naturalization
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
commits
to
congress
the
plenary
power
inherent
in
the
sovereignty
of
every
nation
to
determine
which
aliens
will
be
granted
united
states
citizenship.
as
this
court
said
in
the
ginsburg
case,
no
alien
has
the
slightest
right
to
naturalization
unless
all
statutory
requirements
are
complied
with.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
with
respect
to
that,
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
wong
kim
ark
is
dispositive.
there
the
court
traced
the
history
of
united
states
citizenship
with
reference
to
the
common
law
of
england
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
constitution,
and
in
that
case
the
court
pointed
out
that
at
common
law,
in
order
to
be
a
citizen
at
common
law,
it
was
necessary
for
the
person
to
be
born
in
england.
the
citizenship
conferred
on
people
who
were
born
abroad
to
british
subjects
was
conferred
only
by
statute.
in
other
words,
it
was
not
regarded
historically
in
england
as
a
fundamental--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
i'm
not
disputing
that.
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
this
court
held
in
wong
kim
ark
and
also
held
in
rogers
v.
bellei
that
the
conferral
of
citizenship
on
someone
born
abroad
to
a
united
states
citizen
is
encompassed
in
the
naturalization
clause,
and
the
important
thing
about
wong
kim
ark
is
the
court
distinguished
persons
born
to
u.s.
citizens
abroad
not
on
the
ground
that
that
was
a
more
fundamental
form
of
citizenship,
but
if
anything,
a
less
fundamental
form
of
citizenship.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
once--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--once
the
person
is
a
citizen,
of
course,
then
that
citizen,
like
every
other
citizen,
is
entitled
to
all
the
rights
of
a
citizen
under
the
united
states
constitution.
but
the
question
here
is
who
will
be
entitled
to
enter
the
citizenship
of
the
united
states
to
begin
with,
and
in
that
respect
we
think
this
case
is
identical
to...
at
least
as
strong
as
fiallo
versus
bell,
and,
if
anything,
stronger,
because
it
is
not
merely
the
question
of
who
will
be
entitled
to
physically
enter
the
united
states,
but
who
will
be
regarded
as
a
member
of
our
society
on
a
permanent
basis.
citizenship
is
essentially
irreversible.
an
alien
can
be
expelled.
a
citizen
is
a
permanent
member
of
the
community.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
oh,
absolutely.
no,
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest...
yes.
it's
absolutely
clear
that
a
naturalized
citizen
can
have
his
naturalization
revoked.
for
example,
if
it
was
procured
by
fraud,
but
the
other
important...
and
this
was
significant
in
rogers
v.
bellei,
which
had
to
do
with
the
constitutionality
of
a
condition
subsequent
for
a
citizen,
a
person
who
was
born
abroad
to
united
states
citizens.
in
that
case,
it
was
the
parallel
provision
here
in
1401
(g)
until,
i
believe,
it
was
1978,
someone
in
that
situation
had...
the
child
had
to
reside
in
the
united
states
for
some
period
of
time
after
birth
in
order
to
establish
the
requisite
connection
with
the
united
states,
and
that
was
challenged
on
the
ground
that
the
person
having
been
declared
a
citizen
at
birth,
there
could
not
be
a
condition
subsequent
to
perfecting
it.
and
this
court
upheld
that
provision
in
rogers
v.
bellei,
and
importantly,
it
did
so
by
distinguishing
the
children
of
u.s.
parents
born
abroad
from
those
who
are
born
in
the
united
states
with
the
suggestion
that
congress
has
greater
latitude
with
respect
to
the
naturalization
of
those
persons
than
it
does
to
others,
precisely
because
they
are
not
encompassed
by
the
terms
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
fourteenth
amendment
refers
to
citizens
who
are
born
or
naturalized
in
the
united
states,
and
the
court
pointed
out
that
persons
who
are
born
to
united
states
citizens
abroad
do
not
fall
within
that
description
and
therefore
are
not
citizens
for
fourteenth
amendment
purposes.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
i'm
sorry,
i
do
not
know
the
totals.
i
think
the
statistics
that
were
cited
in
this
court's
opinion
in
miller
v.
albright
suggest
that
the
pool
is
probably
larger
for
the
u.s.
citizen,
children
of
u.s.
citizen
fathers
rather
than
mothers,
which
i
think,
by
the
way--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
that's
true.
and
one
point
i
wanted
to
make,
justice,
an
aside
here,
that
goes,
that
would
go
critically
to
the
question
of
remedy
in
this
case.
if
we
were--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
think
there
is
probably
a
wide
variation
of
the
fact
pattern.
i
took
the
question
to
mean--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
took
the
question
to
be
identifying
the
father
who
is--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
right,
and
even--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
may
or
may
not,
but
if
the
possibility
of
citizenship
was
available
to
people
who
had
no
prior
assumption
that
they
had
any
claim
to
united
states
citizenship,
it
is
valuable
enough
in
the
world
community
that
we
would
expect
people
to
look
for
it.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
in
many
cases
that
is
correct.
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
point
about
fiallo
v.
bell
because,
as
i
said,
i
do
believe
this
case
is
controlled
by
fiallo
v.
bell,
if
anything,
the
reasons
for
the
deference
to
congressional
powers
are
stronger
here
than
they
were
in
fiallo
v.
bell.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
absolutely.
once
a
person
is
a
citizen,
they
are
a
member
of
our
national
community
and
entitled
to
all
of
the
rights
of
any
other
citizen.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
would
have
to
be,
certainly
as
a
statutory
matter
and
perhaps
as
a
constitutional
matter,
some
defect
in
the
original
naturalization
or
the
original--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
but
that's
why
i
think
the
prospect...
i
mean,
i
suppose
if
in
a
situation
like
this
the
child
was
recognized
as
a
u.s.
citizen
on
the
ground
that
the
parent
was
a
u.s.
citizen
and
then
it
turned
out
that
the
parent
was
not
a
u.s.
citizen
after
all,
then
the
child's
citizenship
could
be
revoked
on
the
ground
that
it
was
fraudulently
or
improperly
procured,
so
it
would
be
a
situation
with
a
factual
predicate
for
the
grant
of
citizenship
in
the
first
place.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
would
think--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
believe
that
if
the
question
ever
arose
of
the
denaturalization
of
someone
who
was
born
abroad
to
united
states
citizens,
the
same
standards
would
apply
to
anyone
who
was
naturalized
in
the
united
states
and
therefore
is
a
fourteenth
amendment
citizen,
and
i
believe
the
standard
for
denaturalization
is
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
i'm
not
sure
of
that,
but
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
will.
in
fact,
with
respect
to
fiallo,
we
think
that
all
of
the
reasons
why
deference
to
the
political
branches
in
this
area
applied
to
immigration
in
fiallo
apply
equally
here,
first
of
all
in
fiallo
itself,
the
court
lumped
together
immigration
and
naturalization
at
page
79,
i
believe
it's
792
of
its
opinion,
in
describing
congress'
plenary
powers.
and
also
first
of
all
a
reason
why
fiallo
applies
is
it's
a
question
of
who
is
going
to
enter
our
society.
certainly
the
children
or
parents
in
fiallo
were
seeking
to
come
into
the
united
states
with
the
hope
eventually
of
being
citizens.
in
fiallo
it
was
a
two
step
task.
here
it's
a
one
step,
but
we
don't
think
that
the
analysis
in
fiallo
should
change
on
that.
and
therefore
deciding
who
should
be
a
citizen
is
also
an
aspect
of
who
is
an
alien.
they
are
flip
side
to
the
same
question.
and
congress
has
plenary
power
to
control
which
aliens
will
be
entitled
to
enter
the
united
states.
third,
it's
intimately
tied
up
with
foreign
relations,
and
again
this
is
a
point
that
was
made
in
fiallo
itself.
there
the
court
rejected
the
proposition
at
page
730
that
the
concerns
about
foreign
relations
only
have
to
do
with
situations
where
there
are
grave
threats
to
the
national
security
or
the
general
welfare
of
the
united
states.
the
court
said
it
had
never
deferred
to
the
branches
depending
upon
whether
there
was
some
threat
of
that
nature
or
some
more
individualized
determination
as
to
who
will
be
entitled
to
enter
the
united
states.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
again,
that
may
depend.
i
mean,
if
you
have
a
child
born
abroad
to
two
u.s.
citizen
parents,
that
may
be
true,
it
may
not
be
true,
depending
on
the
country.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
there
are
countries
that
go
both
ways,
but
what--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
is
true,
and
of
course
someone
declared
to
be
a
citizen
under
this
statute
may
also
be
a
citizen
of
someplace
else
as
well.
there
are
questions
of
dual
nationality
that
can
arise.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
the
justification
for
the
shorter
residency
requirement
because
that
is
apt
to
be
true
in
many
cases,
but
the
broader
point--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--they
are
certainly
not
just
as
great.
there
may
be
an
isolated
country
here
and
there
where
the
problem
would
arise,
but
your
question
and
justice
ginsburg's
questions
highlight
another
reason
for
deference
to
congress
in
that
area,
and
that
is
that
congress
has
to
strive
to
make
the
laws
of
this
nation
with
respect
to
immigration
and
naturalization
respond
or
make
sense
vis
a
vis
the
laws
of
not
just
one
other
nation,
but
many,
many
other
nations.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
would
be
subject
to
judicial
review,
and
under
the
facially
legitimate
bona
fide
standard
of
kleindienst
v.
mandel
and
fiallo,
it
would
be
necessary
to
ask
what
congress
was
up
to
in
a
situation
like
that,
so
we
are
not
suggesting
that
there
is--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--given
the
developments
of
equal
protection
under
the
law
in
this
country,
this
court
might
well
conclude
that
it
would
not
be
facially
legitimate
for
congress
simply
to
decide
to
go
back
to
as
you
described
it,
the
bad
old
days
where
all
rights
were
thought
to
derive
from
the
father
or
the
husband.
so
we
are
not
suggesting
that.
but
this
law,
this
law
is
fundamentally
different
from
the
situation
that
you
are
positing.
this
law--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
standard
that
the
court
applied
in
fiallo
v.
bell
was
that...
was
the
facially
legitimate
standard
drawn
from
kleindienst
v.
mandel.
the
law
is
subject
to
scrutiny,
and
whatever
rationale
is
posited
has
to
be
regarded
by
this
court
as
legitimate.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
believe
the
wauchope
decision
that
struck
down
the
provision
that
you're
referring
to,
the
pre-1934
decision,
if
i'm
remembering
correctly,
the
ninth
circuit
decision
i
believe
invalidated
it
under
that
standard.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
believe
it
could
because
fundamentally
what
this
is
about
is
trying
to
put
fathers
of
children
born
out
of
wedlock
abroad
in
a
position
where
they
can
do
the
same
thing
that
a
mother
can
in
order
to
put
them
on
an
equal
plane
with
women.
it
is
not
a
product
of
trying
to
discriminate.
it
is
a
product
of
trying
to
put
men
or
fathers
in
a
position
where
they
can
do
the
same
thing
that
mothers
can
do.
and
let
me
explain
why--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
if
i
may
explain
what,
as
we
understand
it,
is
going
on
here
precisely,
and
that
is
that
congress
made
a
judgment
that
it
wanted,
while
the
child
is
still
a
minor,
for
there
to
be
established
a
legal,
formal
recognized
relationship
between
parent
and
child.
after
the
child
is
no
longer
a
minor,
at
that
point
the
child
is
an
adult
and
can
seek
citizenship
in
his
own
right.
in
this
very
case,
petitioner
nguyen
could
have
applied
for
citizenship
in
his
own
right
after
he
became
an
adult
and
did
not
do
so.
the
idea
is
that
under
these
naturalization...
this
naturalization
provision,
while
one
is
still
a
child,
one
is
under
the
care
of
the
parent.
after
adulthood,
that's
not
so.
so
what
congress
was
focusing
on
was
not
just
biological
paternity,
but
a
recognized
formal
relationship
that
outside
people
could
look
at
and
say,
yes,
that
is
a
father
child
or
mother
child
relationship.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
believe
that...
let
me
start
by
explaining
what
the
situation
is
for
married
parents.
when
you
have
a
child
born
to
married
parents,
you
have
a
legal
relationship
with
mother
and
father
at
the
moment
of
birth.
with
the
mother
by
virtue
of
the
birth
and
with
the
father
by
virtue
of
the
marriage
to
the
mother.
that
marriage
legitimates
the
child
and
establishes
a
legal
father
child
relationship.
where
you
do
not
have
married
children,
there
is
no
lawful
relationship...
or
legal
relationship
between
man
and
woman,
that
in
turn
creates
a
legal
relationship
between
father
and
child.
something
else
needs
to
be
done.
in
the
case
of
the
mother,
the
mother's
relationship
to
the
child,
the
legal
relationship
is
established
at
the
moment
of
birth
in
the
same
way
as
it
is
for
a
married
mother.
the
mother's
name
will
typically
be
on
a
birth
certificate
or,
at
the
very
least,
the
birth
will
be
witnessed
by
all
present.
there
will
not
be
any
question,
just
to
the
biological
maternity--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it's
not
a
differential
standard.
with
all
respect,
it
is
an
attempt
by
congress
to
equalize
two
situations
that
start
out
quite
unequal
because,
as
i
described,
at
the
moment
of
birth
the
mother
has
a
legal
relationship
with
the
child,
that
is
true
in
the
united
states.
it
is
true
virtually
throughout
the
world.
the
child
is
born
to
the
mother,
the
mother
has
custody
as
a
legal
matter,
and
before
that
child
can
be
taken
away
from
the
mother,
the
mother
would
have
to
give
it
up,
relinquish
rights,
legal
rights,
or
they
would
have
to
be
taken
away
from
her.
in
the
case
of
the
father
that
is
not
true
until
paternity
is
established
in
some
formal
or
legal
way,
and
all
that
congress
has
done
here
is
said
that
that
has
to
be
done
before
the
age
of
18,
and
as
this
court's--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
prior
to
1986
the
only
way
that
that
legal
relationship
could
be
established
with
respect
to
the
child
who
was
born
out
of
wedlock
was
by
legitimization,
and--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--because
congress--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--because
congress
decided
that
derivative
citizenship
from
a
u.s.
citizen
should
only
apply
while
the
child
is,
in
fact,
a
child.
you
have
the
formal
legal
relationship
which
can
then
be
a
springboard
for
a
practical
relationship
between
parent
and
child,
but
not
only
that,
citizenship
itself
is
a
formal
relationship
between
the
citizen
and
the
country,
and
congress
could
reasonably
conclude
that
in
order
to
recognize
a
formal
legal
relationship
between
a
child
in
the
united
states,
a
central
element
of
that,
the
relationship
of
the
child
to
parent
should
have
a
comparable
formality
and
recognition
so
that
it
is
recognized
by
the
father
and
child
and
by
those
looking
at
that
relationship
as
not
just
a
biological
relationship,
perhaps
even
a
deep
biological
relationship,
but
a
lawful,
formal
recognized
one
that
the
rest
of
the
world
and
this
country
can
look
to,
because
citizenship,
in
fact,
carries
rights
and
responsibilities
on
behalf
of
both
the
citizen
and
the
nation,
rights
of
protection,
rights
of
duties
to
serve
in
the
armed
forces,
and
congress
could
reasonably
decide
that
it
is
not
sufficient
that
out
there
somewhere
during
a
child's
minority
there
was
someone
who
was
a
biological
parent.
it
is
necessary
that
the
formal
legal
relationship
be
regarded
as
in
existence
during
the
minority.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
one
of
the
things
that
congress
is
aiming
at
is
the
existence
of
the
legal
relationship
by
18.
that's
set
forth
explicitly
in
the
statute.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
correct,
unless
and
until
the
father's
paternity
is
formally
established.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
it's
not
entirely
gone
because
while
dna...
it's
important
not
to
focus
solely
on
the
domestic
situation
in
the
united
states
in
looking
at
this
law,
and
that
goes
both
with
respect
to
assumptions
about
proving
paternity
and
assumptions
about
what
the
law
is
or
ought
to
be.
the
other
nations
in
the
world
are
not
necessarily
living
under
the
same
availability
of
medical
care,
the
same--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
true,
but
the
age
18--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
although
the
age
18
would
help
to
deter
some
fraudulent
claims,
but
that's
not
our
principal
submission
here.
our
principal
submission
is
that
the
recognition
of
the
legal
relationship
is
itself
a
legitimate
interest,
and
in
this
respect
we
think
this
case
is
very
similar--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
congress
could
reasonably
conclude
that
with
respect
to
mothers,
and
this
is
true
of
both
mothers
in
wedlock
and
out
of
wedlock,
that
the
legal
relationship
is
established
at
the
moment
of
birth.
this
court
pointed
that
out
in
the
lalli
decision
and
pointed
it
out...
we
quoted
page
34
of
our
brief
from
this
court's
decision
in
lehr
v.
robertson
which
we
think
is
very
instructive.
there
the
court
said
the
mother
carries
and
bears
the
child.
in
this
sense
her
parental
relationship
is
clear.
the
validity
of
the
father's
parental
claims
must
be
gauged
by
other
measures.
and
again
this
is
not
just
proof.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
if
congress
could
conclude
that
in
virtually
every
case
that
requirement
is
satisfied
at
the
moment
of
birth,
it
would
be
unnecessary
to
require
the
mother
to
go
through
that,
and
in
fact
if
that
sort
of
requirement
would
be
imposed
now
there
could
be
all
sorts
of
children
of
u.s.
citizen
mothers
who
would
never
have
taken
a
step
like
that.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
on
the
remedy--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
is
a
severability
clause,
but
we
think
the
proper
remedy
would
be
to
sever
1409
and
put
the
ball
in
congress'
court
to
decide
how
to
deal
with
this
particular
problem.
we
think
that's
true
for
several
reasons.
for
one
thing,
if
this
court
were
to
broadly
declare
that
a
whole
new
category
of
persons
were
united
states
citizens
there
may
be
some
question
as
to
whether
congress
could
undo
that.
that,
coupled
with
the
point
that
this
court
made
in
ginsberg
and
pangilinan
that
it's
questionable
whether
a
court
can
ever
declare
someone
to
be
a
citizen
when
congress
has
not
so
declared,
we
think
way
powerfully
in
the
direction
of
striking
section
1409
and
letting
congress
decide
what
is
the
proper
remedy
in
the
situation.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
because
in
our
view
the
admission
to
citizenship
is
so
central
to
the
formation
of
our
society
and...
our
society
under
the
constitution
that
it
is
fundamentally
different,
and
this
court
says--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
and
in
the
situations
you're
describing,
you're
describing
situations
that
arise
wholly
in
the
domestic
context.
here
we
have--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i'm
not
aware
whether
a
bill
was
introduced.
i
did
want
to
point
out
one
further,
one
last
thing
on
the
question
of
remedy.
if
one
thing
is
clear
from
1940
until
1986,
it
is
congress
did
not
want
u.s.
citizenship
to
pass
solely
by
virtue
of
mere
biological
paternity.
congress
insisted
on
something
more
in
1940
and
1952
and
1986,
in
1952.
in
all
of
those
situations,
congress
moved
to
make
things
easier
for
u.s.
citizen
fathers
to
transmit
citizenship.
from
1952
to
1986,
only
legitimization,
which
often
meant
marrying
the
mother,
was
adequate.
in
1986
congress
tried
to
ease
things
to
make
it
easier
for
u.s.
citizen
fathers
to
put
themselves
in
the
same
position
as
u.s.
citizen
mothers,
by
providing
for
the
acknowledgment
of
the
child
in
writing
so
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
resort
to
the
varying
state
laws
regarding
legitimization
or
elsewhere.
the
last
point
i
would
like
to
make
with
respect
to...
two
other
points.
one,
this
is
a
transaction
that
occurred
abroad,
not
in
the
united
states.
it
involved
one
alien
and
one
u.s.
citizen.
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
the
heightened
scrutiny
under
our
constitution
would
ordinarily
be
thought
to
apply
because
of
a
solely
domestic
setting,
but
i
should
point
out
that--
