justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
miss
davis,
do
i
take...
do
i
understand
correctly
the
point
you're
making
is
that
the
people
who
are
being
brought
in
or
sought
to
be
brought
in
in
fiallo
were
coming
in
as
aliens
who
might
never
become
citizens,
they
were
not
coming
in
as
citizens?
they
were
coming
in
as
preference,
preference-eligible
aliens,
and
now
you're
saying,
the
distinction
that
you're
making,
if
i
grasp
it
correctly,
is
these
people,
if
you
are
correct,
will
never
come
in
as
aliens.
the
application
is
that
the
citizenship
should
be
recognized
immediately.
that's
the
distinction
you're
making?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
miss
davis,
may
we
go
back
a
few
steps
because
you
said
something
that
surprised
me.
i
know
that
the
solicitor
general
took
the
line
in
its
brief
that
there
are
only
two
kinds
of
citizens...
born
in
the
united
states,
and
everybody
else
for
constitutional
purposes
is
naturalized.
my
grandson
was
born
in
paris
of
u.s.
citizen
parents.
i
had
never
considered
him
a
naturalized
citizen
of
the
united
states,
but
is
that
his
correct
status?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
such
a
person
be
denaturalized?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
has
never
been
applied
in
that
whole
line
of
cases.
they
are
all
cases
of
people
who
are
admitted
as
aliens,
so
if
it
were
to
extend
to
such
a
case,
it
would
be
an
extension.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
debate
over
whether
someone
born
abroad
could
be
a
candidate
for
president?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
the
court
ever
in
those
extension
versus
invalidation
cases,
has
it
ever
taken
the
route
of
lessening
the
benefits
instead
of
equalizing
up?
has
it
ever
equalized
down
instead
of
up?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
understand
though
that
we
are
now
engaged
in
an
academic
discussion?
because
in
this
case
he
has
no
standing
to
raise
that
problem
since
he
amply
meets
the
residence
requirements,
so
he
can't
raise
somebody
else's
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
things
that
hold
him
back,
the
two
things,
seem
to
me
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
statelessness
concern
anyway,
the
formal
acknowledgment
of
paternity
and
proof
of
support,
of
418.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
statelessness.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
any
academic
right
is...
there's
a
debate
over
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
a
debate
over
whether
my
grandson
is
a
natural
born
citizen.
i
think
he
is.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler,
before
we
get
to
that,
why
would
it?
you
said
it
in
your
brief.
it
seems
to
me
you
have
a
tremendous
hurdle
in
the
beginning.
if
the
notion
is
that
there
are
these
men
out
there
who
are
being
johnny
appleseed
around,
to
prove
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
they
are
the
father,
for
the
person
to
even...
the
woman
even
to
identify
this
person
seems
to
me
an...
but
most
of
the
cases
of
men
who
don't
want
to
be
fathers
who
have
in
fact
have
sired
children
abroad,
it
isn't
difficult
at
all
to
escape
that
obligation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
once
we
find
out
who
he
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
may
even
take
an
awful
lot
of
resources
to
find
out
who
he
is,
to
get
him
to
take
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
before
you
do
that,
mr.
kneedler,
you
did
say
something.
i
keep
worrying
about
this
grandson
of
mine.
you
said
that
he's
not
a
citizen
for
purposes
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
i
assume
he
had
the
same
equal
protection
rights
and
due
process
rights--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
think
he
might
be
denaturalized,
the
way
a
naturalized
citizen
could
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
no
naturalization.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler,
i
have
this
problem
with
it.
you
would
surely
have
a
huge
statelessness
problem
if
you
didn't
recognize
that
the
child
born
abroad
to
u.s.
citizens
is
a
u.s.
citizen
because,
as
you
point
out
in
most
countries
in
the
world,
they
go
by
blood,
not
by
land
of
birth.
so...
but
you
don't
have
that
situation
with...
an
alien
coming
to
our
shores
is
a
citizen
of
someplace.
so
the...
you
call
the
child
born
abroad
an
alien,
but
in
most
places
in
the
world
that
child
would
not
be
a
citizen
of
the
place
in
which
that
person
is
born;
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
thought
you
said
in
your
brief
that
in
most
places,
and
i
think
it's
right,
they
do
not
go
on
just
solely,
they
go
on
the
parentage.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
person
coming
in
in
fiallo
is
a
citizen
of
someplace.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
brought
up
the
problem,
you
said
one
of
the
reasons
for
this
is
that
the
child
and
the
mother
will
be
a
citizen
of
no
place
if
not
of
the
united
states.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler,
if
congress
went
back
to
the
way
it
when
was
everything
was
determined
by
the
father's
citizenship,
go
back
before
1934,
suppose
congress
accepts
your
argument
or
we
accept
your
argument
and
say
plenary
power,
they
can
do
whatever
they
damn
please,
so
they
say
children
born
abroad
of
fathers
who
are
u.s.
citizens
can
become
u.s.
citizens,
but
not
children
who
are
born
abroad
of
u.s.
citizen
mothers
where
the
father
is
an
alien.
that's
the
way
it
used
to
be
in
the
bad
old
days.
i
take
it
from
your
argument
if
congress
wanted
to
go
back
to
that,
it
would
not
offend
anything
in
the
u.s.
constitution
to
do
so.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
congress
wants
to
restore
the
way
it
was,
the
way
it
was
for
most
of
our
nation's
history,
that
the
father's
citizenship
gets
transferred
to
the
child,
not
the
mother's?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
that
might
violate
equal
protection,
but
even
under
some
plenary
power
notion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
case
in
all
the
area
where
they
do
apply
the
lesser
standard
that
has
ever
come
out
against
the
government,
against
the
classification
that
congress
made?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
talking
to
children
not
born
to
a
marriage
because--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
used
to
be
in
the
old
days,
even
though
the
mother
bore
the
child,
she
was
not
the
parent
that
counted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
kneedler,
how
does
that
differ
from
the
clause
of
the
constitution
that
says
no
money
shall
be
drawn
from
the
treasury
but
in
consequence
of
appropriations
made
by
law,
no
money,
and
yet
you
know
the
whole
line
of
cases
from
frontier
out
to
wescott
that
this
court
thought
was
compatible
with
that
clause.
i
don't
see
any
difference,
frankly,
between
those
two.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no
money
shall
be
drawn
from
the
treasury
but
in
consequences
of
appropriations
made
by
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
a
problem
for
the
child
in
lehr?
lehr,
one
of
the
grave
concerns
i
thought
was
holding
up
an
adoption,
holding
up
placing
a
child
in
a
secure
setting.
here
you
have
none
of
that.
it
would
benefit
the
child,
surely,
to
be
a
u.s.
citizen.
you're
not
hurting
the
mother.
it's
worlds
different
from
lehr.
