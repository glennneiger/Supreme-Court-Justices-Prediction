section
1409
of
title
8
united
state
code
governs
the
acquisition
of
united
states
citizenship
by
persons
who
are
born
to
one
united
states
citizen
parent
and
one
noncitizen
parent
when
the
parents
are
unmarried
and
when
the
child
is
born
outside
of
the
united
states.
the
statute
imposes
different
requirements
for
the
child’s
acquisition
of
citizenship
depending
upon
whether
the
citizen
parent
is
the
mother
or
the
father.
in
particular,
a
citizen
father
is
required
to
legitimate
the
child
or
acknowledge
paternity
under
oath
or
established
paternity
by
adjudication
but
one
of
those
acts
must
occur
before
the
child
turns
18.
tuan
nguyen
was
born
in
vietnam,
his
father
is
joseph
boulais,
an
american
citizen
and
his
mother
was
a
vietnamese.
boulais
and
the
child’s
mother
were
not
married.
when
nguyen
was
just
6-years-old
boulais
brought
him
to
the
united
states
and
nguyen
was
raised
here
by
his
father
and
was
a
lawful
permanent
resident.
after
nguyen
was
convicted
of
sexual
assault
on
a
child,
ins,
immigration
and
naturalization
service,
initiated
deportation
proceedings
against
him
as
an
alien.
nguyen
eventually
asserted
that
he
is
a
united
states
citizen
by
virtue
of
the
blood
tie
to
his
father
boulais.
when
nguyen
was
28
years
old,
boulais
obtained
an
order
of
parentage
from
the
texas
court.
because
boulais
did
not
obtained
that
order
before
he
reached
the
age
of
18,
however,
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
determined
that
section
1409
had
not
been
satisfied.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
statutory
distinction
between
citizen
mothers
and
citizen
fathers
is
consistent
with
the
constitutional
guarantee
of
equal
protection,
we
now
affirm.
for
agenda
based
distinction
to
withstand
equal
protection
scrutiny,
it
must
be
established
at
least
that
the
challenged
classification
serves
important
governmental
interest
and
that
discriminatory
means
employed
or
substantially
related
to
the
achievement
of
those
interests
or
objectives.
section
1409
is
substantially
related
to
the
achievement
of
two
governmental
objectives:
first,
the
statute
bares
a
substantial
relation
to
the
governmental
interest
in
assuring
that
a
biological
parent-child
relationship
exists.
in
the
case
of
the
mother
the
relation
is
verifiable
from
the
birth
itself,
the
mother’s
status
is
documented
in
most
instances
by
the
birth
certificate
or
hospital
records
and
the
witnesses
who
attest
to
her
having
given
birth.
in
the
case
of
the
father,
however,
the
uncontestable
fact
is
that
he
need
not
be
present
at
the
birth
if
he
is
present
furthermore
that
circumstance
is
not
incontrovertible
proof
of
fatherhood.
fathers
and
mothers
does
not
similarly
situated
with
respect
to
the
event
of
birth
and
proof
of
biological
parenthood.
section
1409
represents
a
permissible
judgment
by
congress
that
the
father
must
act
to
provide
the
assurance
of
biological
fatherhood
that
is
inherent
in
the
mother’s
relationship
to
the
birth
of
the
child.
second,
section
1409
substantially
furthers
the
important
governmental
interest
in
insuring
at
least
the
potential
for
genuine
relationship
between
the
citizen
parent
and
child
to
develop.
such
a
relationship
not
only
provides
a
bond
between
the
citizen
child
and
the
parent,
it
also
ties
the
child
through
the
citizen
parent
to
the
united
states
which
is
the
very
basis
of
meaningful
citizenship.
a
mother
knows
in
every
instance
that
a
child
exists
and
is
hers
and
has
at
least
some
opportunity
for
contact
with
the
child.
in
the
case
of
the
father,
biology
does
not
provide
these
assurances.
section
1409,
represents
a
permissible
effort
by
congress
to
take
account
of
this
difference
by
requiring
the
father
to
engage
in
some
form
of
conduct
acknowledging
paternity
before
the
child
turns
18.
the
statute
insures
at
least
an
initial
contact
between
father
and
child,
and
thus
the
opportunity
for
a
relationship
to
develop.
we
have
never
required
a
gender-based
statute
to
achieve
some
ultimate
objective
in
every
instance
in
order
to
survive
equal
protection
scrutiny.
substantial
furtherance
of
the
interest
is
sufficient.
the
statute
is
consistent
with
the
constitutional
guarantee
of
equal
protection
to
fail
to
acknowledge
even
our
most
basic
biological
differences
such
as
the
fact
that
a
mother
must
be
present
at
birth
but
the
father
need
not
be.
risks
making
the
guarantee
of
equal
protection
superficial
and
so
disserving
it,
mechanistic
classification
of
all
of
our
differences
as
stereotypes
would
operate
to
obscure
those
misconceptions
and
prejudices
that
are
real.
the
distinction
embodied
in
the
statutory
scheme
here
at
issue
is
not
marked
by
misconception
and
prejudice
nor
does
it
show
disrespect
for
either
class.
the
difference
between
men
and
women
in
relation
to
the
birth
process
is
a
real
one,
and
the
principle
of
the
equal
protection
does
not
forbid
congress
to
address
the
problem
at
hand
in
a
manner
specific
to
each
gender.
