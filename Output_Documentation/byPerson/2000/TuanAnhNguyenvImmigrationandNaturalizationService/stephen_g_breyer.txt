justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
wonder,
suppose
there
were
no
naturalization
clause,
suppose
it
didn't
exist.
wouldn't
congress
still
have
the
power
to
enact
this
statute?
no
one
is
being
naturalized.
they
are
simply
stating
who
is
a
citizen.
just
as,
after
all,
no
one
in
1789
had
been
born
in
the
united
states
of
america
or
very
few,
and
there
had
to
be
rules
as
to
who
was
a
citizen
and
who
isn't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
congress
said
everyone
in
1780
who
has
been
born
in
the
united
states
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states,
would
that
have
been
naturalizing
everybody?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
saying
that
children
of
american
parents
born
abroad,
of
whom
there
are
millions
and
millions,
are
naturalized
citizens
and
could
never
be
president
like
george
romney
couldn't
have
run
for
president?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i
mean,
their...
their
citizenship
is
conferred
by
statute,
and
they
are
citizens
from
birth,
and
there
are
probably
tens
of
millions
of
them,
and
george
romney
was
one
of
them,
and
i
had
not
thought
that
they
were
naturalized
citizens.
i
thought
they
were
citizens
who
were
citizens
by
virtue
of
their
birth,
and
they're
citizens
from
birth,
but
you
were
saying
they're
the
same
as
naturalized.
or
maybe
i
misunderstood.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
so,
then
those
who...
then
those
who
are
born
abroad
of
an
american
parent
are
natural
born
citizens
in
your
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
contrasted
with
naturalized
citizens
who
would
have
been
aliens
who
previously
were
aliens
and
would
have
become
citizens
by
virtue
of
a
naturalization
law;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i...
for
present
purposes
what
we're
interested
in
is
what
standard
of
review
to
apply,
and
whether
the
extremely
deferential
standard
applies
to
these
natural
born
citizens.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
not
so.
i
mean,
you're
right
in
saying
by
statute.
normally
in
all
countries
citizenship
was
conferred
by
statute.
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
passed
to
the
problem
of
slavery.
but
statutes
traditionally
transmitted
citizenship
most
cases
through
blood.
isn't
that
true?
and
so
would
you
say
that
when
the
united
states
passes
a
statute
like
any
other
country
that
transmits
citizenship
through
blood
that
they
treat
that
person
who
results
as
a
citizen
the
same
way
precisely
as
a
naturalized
citizen?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
in
other
words,
in
your
view,
the
hundreds
of
millions
of
people
by
now
who
may
have
been
born
abroad
of
american
parents
are
suddenly
subject,
when
their
constitutional
rights
are
at
stake,
to
a
less
basic
review
by
the
courts
than
citizens
who
are
born
in
the
united
states?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
citizens
of
service
people,
citizens
of
millions
of
people
who
have
lived
abroad?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
problem
with
those
things
is
usually,
is
insofar
as
you
get
a
lesser
degree
of,
for
example,
procedural
protections,
in
certain
instances
there
are
conflicts
about
what
the
facts
are,
and
insofar,
if
it
is
ever
true
that
a
person
who
is
involved
in
naturalization
gets
less
than
full
judicial
review,
would
that
same
be
true
of,
say,
my
daughter
or
millions
of
others,
say,
servicemen's
children
who
are
born
abroad
and
who
the
children
of
servicemen
and
women
who
are
abroad
and
not
born
in
the
united
states?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
naturalized
people
get
lesser
protection,
less
than
full
review.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
presupposes
that
the
father
accepts
all
this,
i
mean,
but
just
doesn't
do
it
in
the
way
that
it's
said,
or
suppose
a
mother.
i
mean,
you
understand
the
problem.
you
can
create
situations
where
the
mother
is
not
the
caretaker,
where
the
father
is
the
caretaker,
and
you
get
everything
the
other
way
around.
what
is
the
answer
to
that?
i
mean,
what's
the...
or
you
could
be
in
a
country
where
it
doesn't
descend
one
way
or
you
could
be
in
a
state
where
they
have
different
relationships.
i
mean,
why
not
tie
it
to
the
relation
or
the
statelessness
or
to
the
thing
you're
aiming
at
rather
than
to
gender?
