let's
assume
the
statute
was
slightly
different
and
the
citizenship
to
be
conferred
did
not
recognize...
did
not
relate
back
to
birth.
would
you
then
say
that
the
statute
with
that
one
change
in
it
exceeded
congress'
plenary
power
under
the
naturalization
clause?
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
it
would
be
simpler
if
i
asked
the...
i
think
i
can
ask
the
question
a
different
way.
do
you
think
that
the...
the...
the
act
of
recognizing
citizenship
here
for
children
born
abroad
is
naturalization
within
the
meaning
of
the
naturalization
clause?
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
that's
what
i
wanted
to
get
at.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
wouldn't
the
simpler
way
to
do
that
be
simply
to
have
one
uniform
support
or
recognition
standard?
i
mean
why
do
you
have
to
have
differential
standards
in
the
statute
if
that's
all
you
want
to
do?
on
your...
on
the
factual
assumptions
that
you
are
making,
which
may
well
be
true,
it
would
be
easier
for
the
children
of
american
mothers
born
abroad
to
satisfy
the
standard,
but
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
an
argument
for
having
differential
standards.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
why
not
have
the
same
criteria
to
determine
whether
that
relationship,
if
proven,
is
adequate
for
citizenship
purposes?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
the
crucial
point?
isn't
it
the
case
that
if
you
were
arguing
this
case
20
years
ago
before
dna
testing
had
become
current,
one
of
your
arguments
and
one
that
we
might
well
accept
would
be,
there's
a
terribly
difficult
problem
of
proof
here,
and
one
of
the
interests
of
the
united
states
is
to
avoid
fraud
in
claims
of
citizenship.
but
that
issue
is
gone
now,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
that's
the
case,
then
the
proof
of
the
relationship
is
simply
going
to
be
much
more
difficult
for
the
child
who
is
in
this
other
country
without
the
benefit--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
how
does
the
united
states
suffer
simply
because
under
a
nondifferential
standard
the
child
abroad
without
a
dna
lab
nearby
is
going
to
have
a
tough
time
proving
the
relationship?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
isn't
the
answer
to
that
then
require
the
indicia
of
recognition
to
be
the
same
for
mothers
and
fathers?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
simply
means
that
congress
has
nothing
to
lose
by
a
differential
standard.
it
simply
means
that
the
child
of
the
mother
is
going
to
have
an
easier
time
proving
it.
