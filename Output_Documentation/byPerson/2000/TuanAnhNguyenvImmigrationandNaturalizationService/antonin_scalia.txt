miss
davis,
i
gather
your
position
would
be
different
if
in
addition
to
the
three
conditions
that
you
mentioned
there
were
a
fourth
condition,
and
that
is
that
the
child
of
the
american
father
swear
allegiance
to
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
yes.
before
he
could
retroactively
be
deemed
a
united
states
citizen
from
birth,
in
addition
to
the
other
three
factors,
he
must
swear
allegiance
to
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
thought
your
argument
hinged
entirely
upon
the
fact
that
there's
no
problem
about
changing
allegiances,
and
this
would
require
him
to
change
allegiance,
to
swear
allegiance
to
the
united
states
over
whatever
other
country
he
had
come
from.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
opinions...
it
seems
to
me
so
artificial
to
say
that
simply
because
you
make
the
admission
retroactive
and
say
he
shall
be
deemed
to
have
been
a
citizen
from
birth,
somehow
the
power
of
congress
to
make
people
who
are
not
born
in
this
country
and
therefore
automatically
citizens,
citizens
somehow
becomes
abridged.
i
don't...
i
just
don't
see
how
the
retroactivity...
it's
such
an
artificial
device.
congress
could
make
it
retroactive
or
not
retroactive.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
we're
not
talking
about
the
statute.
i
can
agree
that
you
can...
you
can
make
a
statutory
distinction
between
those
two
situations,
but
does
that
convert
into
a
constitutional
distinction?
and
that's
what
you're
arguing
before
us,
that
there
is
some
things
you
can
constitutionally
do
when
you
make
the
person
retroactively
from
birth
a
united
states
citizen
or
things
that
you
can't
do
when
you
do
that
that
you
could
do
if
you
didn't
make
him
retroactively.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
assumes
the
person
is
not
an
alien
simply
because
congress
says
the
person
shall
be
retroactively
deemed
a
citizen.
but
for
constitutional
purposes,
it
seems
to
me,
as
opposed
to
statutory
purposes,
whether
the
person
is
an
alien
or
not
should
depend
upon
whether
the
person
is
a
natural
born
citizen
of
the
united
states
or
whether
citizenship
must
be
conferred
by
congress.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
has
not
been
called
natural
born
citizenship?
i
mean,
isn't
it
clear
that
the
natural
born
requirement
in
the
constitution
was
intended
explicitly
to
exclude
some
englishmen
who
had
come
here
and
spent
some
time
here
and
then
went
back
and
raised
their
families
in
england?
they
did
not
want
that.
they
wanted
natural
born
americans.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
jus
soli,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe.
i'm
just
referring
to
the
meaning
of
natural
born
within
the
constitution.
i
don't
think
you're
disagreeing.
it
requires
jus
soli,
doesn't
it?
