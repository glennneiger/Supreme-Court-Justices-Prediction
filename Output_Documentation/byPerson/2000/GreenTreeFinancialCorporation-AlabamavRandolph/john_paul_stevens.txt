justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question,
to
be
sure
i
get
it
in
before
the
hour
goes
by,
on
question
2.
do
you
think
there
are...
let's
assume
you're
dead
right,
that
the
arbitration
clause
does
not
have
to
specify
the
costs
in
detail
and
so
forth.
now,
are
there
cases,
and
i'm
wondering
in...
take
care
of
this
one...
in
which
an
arbitration
clause
could
be
so
one
sided
that
it's
not
enforceable?
this
clause,
as
i
read
it,
preserves
the
company's
right
to
judicial
remedy.
it
says
the
arbitration
clause
shall
not
interfere
with
their
right
to
use
the
judicial
process
to
secure
relief,
but
it
does
interfere
with
the
other
side's
right.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
that's
sufficiently
one
sided
to
raise
a
question
or
not,
but
are
there
clauses
that
are
so
one
sided
that
it
might
not
be
enforceable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
the
relief
you're
asking
for
on
that
ground
that
we
send
it
back
and
give
the
plaintiff
the
opportunity
to
make
that
showing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
your
client
makes
its
position
on
this
issue
known
to
the
district
court,
what
the...
how
the
costs
would
be
allocated
and
so
forth,
or
did
they
just
say,
we'll
fight
it
out
when
we
get
to
the
arbitrator?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
didn't
volunteer
them,
of
course.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
they--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--they
pay
the
costs
even
if
they
didn't
lose?
