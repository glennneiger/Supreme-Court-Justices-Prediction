why
can't
you
just
ask
the
arbitrator
to
make
that
decision
at
the
outset?

why
can't
the
claimant
simply
ask
the
arbitrator
to
please
make
the
determination
at
the
outset
as
to
what
the
fees
are
going
to
be?
you'd
have
a
filing
fee
and
you'd
say,
for
your
first
hour,
first
half
a
day,
tell
me
what's
involved,
i
might
want
to
get
out
of
here.

i
know
there'd
be
a
filing
fee--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--an
initial
fee,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
if
the
parties
agree
on
arbitration,
and
the
arbitrator
has
to
be
fair
not
only
in
the
decision
but
in
the
allocation
of
costs
and
expenses,
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
for
the
arbitration.
