justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
did
they
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
did
the...
the
only...
i'm
totally
puzzled,
frankly,
by
this
statute,
and
i
did
notice
the
only
people
who
seem
to
understand
it,
because
i
guess
they
wrote
it,
was
the
judicial
conference,
and
they
put
in
the
legislative
history
that
it
would
allow
appeals
from
final
judgments,
including
the
final
judgment
in
an
action
to
compel
arbitration,
or
a
final
action
dismissing
an
action
in
deference
to
arbitration,
so
i
didn't
see
that
last...
what
could
that
last
statement
mean,
other
than
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
it's
not
a...
an
obvious
thing
that
you
would
want
to
allow
an
appeal
in
this
kind
of
a
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it's
not
obvious
that
you
wouldn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
do
the
other
way.
you
see,
there's
situation
a,
where
a
plaintiff...
a
plaintiff
wants
arbitration,
and
the
defendant
doesn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
plaintiff
would
love
to
go
to
arbitration,
defendant
doesn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
is
he
supposed
to
do?
the
defendant
won't
show
up
in
the
room,
won't
set
it
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
goes
to
court
and
asks
the
judge,
judge,
send
him
to
arbitration,
and
the
judge
does
or
he
doesn't.
either
way,
he
gets
an
appeal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
either
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
the
converse
case,
the
plaintiff
does
not
want
arbitration,
but
the
defendant
does.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
plaintiff
runs
into
court
and
brings
his
case.
the
defendant
says,
judge,
send
me
to
arbitration.
if
the
judge
doesn't
send
him
to
arbitration,
there's
an
immediate
appeal,
and
if
he
does
send
him
to
arbitration,
on
your
view
he's
out
to
lunch,
stuck.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
their
view
it's
at
least--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--consistent.
you
know,
both
ways--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
get
an
appeal
under
both
situations.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
can
do
it
where
it's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--where's
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
that's
a
big
exception.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
suppose
that
you...
this
is
what's
bothering
me
a
lot.
you
have
a
plaintiff
bringing
a
claim.
count
1,
nothing
to
do
with
arbitration.
count
ii,
nothing
to
do
with
arbitration,
iii,
nothing
to
do
with
it,
count
iv,
arbitration's
at
issue.
the
judge,
instead
of
staying
it,
dismisses
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
appeal?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you'd
have
to...
the
other
side
would
have
to
cross
appeal.
they
would
say...
what
they
would
say
is,
this
should
have
been
stayed
and
not
dismissed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
what's
bothering
me
about
accepting
your
position,
which
is
very
logical
and
may
be
absolutely
the
right
one,
but
we're
going
to
create
now
a
whole
spin
off
web
of
law,
and
the
web
of
law
is
going
to
be...
because
the
first
thing
that's
going
to
happen
every
time,
you
see...
not
every
time,
but
what
will
happen
is
the
judge...
the
plaintiff
brings
a
case.
judge
dismisses
it.
aha,
says
the
plaintiff,
now
i
can
appeal,
and
there
will
be
a
cross
appeal,
and
the
claim
will
be
that
in
fact
this
is
a
case
where
there
should
have
been
a
stay,
and
not
a
dismissal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
pretty
soon
rules
of
law
will
develop
as
to
just
when
it's
the
one,
and
when
it's
the
other,
and
all
that
means,
delay,
delay,
delay,
the
very
opposite
of
what
the
arbitration
act
is
designed
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mm
hmm.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
don't
think
you
as
a
lawyer
will
be
capable,
even
in
my
imaginary
case,
of
arguing
that,
although
the
judge
thought
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
it,
or
it
really
did,
or
the
judge
thought
it
did
but
it
really
didn't,
et
cetera?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
doesn't
alabama
law
cover
that?
i
mean,
maybe
it...
i
found,
or
my
law
clerk
found
a
case
here
involving
green
tree
where
the
alabama
supreme
court
says,
where
a
clause
in
a
contract
is
silent
on
a
particular
question,
notions
of
fairness
and
settled
principles
of
alabama
law
prevent
us
from
deciding
the
question
by
indulging
in
assumption
that
the
proof
would
support
a
worst
case
scenario.
it's
a
rather--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
why,
following
just
alabama
law,
wouldn't
you
say,
well,
what
we're
going
to
do
is
assume
that
it
will
be
interpreted
in
a
reasonable
way
that
would
support
the
arbitration--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
either
fair
or
not.
you
said,
it
will
make
her
go
forward
on
an
assumption
the
costs
would
be
allocated
in
a
fair
way.
well,
what's
wrong
with
going
forward
on
an
assumption
that
they'll
be
allocated
in
a
fair
way?
how
could
anybody
object
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--then
that
wouldn't
be
very
fair,
would
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
you
do
this
in
respect
to
costs--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--could
you
do
the
following?
i'm
not
sure
you
can.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
see
that
alabama
says
customer
usage
is
used
to
interpret
the
silent
contract,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
associations
like
the
american
arbitration
association
that
have
gone
to
enormous
trouble
to
figure
out
how
to
structure
costs
and
procedures
so
as
to
be
fair
to
consumers
or
others
who
don't
have
the
money,
and
they
might
be
frightened
of
the
costs.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
could
you
read
that
customs
or
usage
in
alabama
as
embodying
some
such
system,
or
the
like,
not
necessarily
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--arbitration
one,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--some
such
system
that
would
avoid
the
problem
of
later
unconscionability,
and
would
therefore
make
the
thing
valid,
and
both
valid
and
fair?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
then
couldn't
the
court
in
this
instance
have
said,
look,
we
have
a
silent
contract
here.
alabama
tells
us
to
use
customer
usage.
by
that,
they
mean
customer
usage
that
will
make
the
provision
valid
if
it
exists,
and
here
is
a
body
that
does
that,
and
so
we
assume
something
like
that
will
be.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
class...
i
don't...
the
class
action
issue
seems
harder
to
get
a
hold
of
to
me
at
the
moment
because
it's...
seems
like
a
pure
state
law
issue.
they're
interpreting
the
contract,
and
they
simply
interpret
the
contract,
perhaps
wrongly,
so
that
the
class
action
in
this
case,
in
this
contract,
is
not
excluded
from
the
arbitration.
the
other
questions,
of
course,
are
also
state
law
questions,
but
they
basically
are
questions
of
state
law
that
are
made
federal
because
of
the
policy
of
the
arbitration
act,
contrary
to
hostility
by
the
state
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
class
action--
