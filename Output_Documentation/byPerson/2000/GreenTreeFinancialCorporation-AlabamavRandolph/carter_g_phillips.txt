mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
central
flaw
in
the
jurisdictional
and
the
enforceability
of
holdings
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
is
the
manifest
hostility
that
court
demonstrated
towards
arbitration.
the
view
reflected
in
those
holdings
is,
to
use
a
phrase
that
this
court
used
in
similar
circumstances,
quote,
far
out
of
step
with
this
court's
endorsement
over
the
past
15
years
of
arbitration
as
an
effective
and
an
efficient
method
of
dispute
resolution
of
federal
statutory
claims.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
do,
mr.
chief
justice,
largely
because
it's
reasonably
clear
that
had
the
court
treated
that
order
as
an
interlocutory
order,
then
this
matter
would
have
gone
immediately
to
arbitration,
and
the
arbitration
process
would
have
been
allowed
to
go
forward.
by
treating
it
as
a
final
judgment,
as
the
court
did,
it
then
undertook
to
review
the
merits
of
arbitrability--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--there
is
no
question,
justice
o'connor,
that
this
case
would
have
and
probably
should
have
been
dealt
with
as
a
stay
order.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
section
3
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
quite
plainly
states
that
the
court
shall
enter
a
stay.
in
this
context
i
think
he
did
this
to
clear
his
docket,
although
that
was
not
specifically
our
request.
that
was
his
decision.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
is
still
an
embedded
proceeding,
and
even
though
he
ultimately
dismisses
everything,
it
is
certainly
available
to
come
back
to
him
at
the
end
of
the
arbitration
and
have
these
issues
reviewed,
and
it
would
certainly
be
much
easier--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--as
a
matter
of
judicial--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
if
you
take
it
to
the
flip
side,
though,
justice
ginsburg,
what
happens
in
the
situation
where
you
deny
summary
judgment
but
style
it
as
formally
a
final
judgment,
even
though
it
in
fact
isn't
a
final--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--clearly
that's
not
what
the
judge
did
here,
and
the
question
is,
what
should
an
appellate
court
do
when
it's
presented
with
this
particular
problem,
and
my
answer
to
you
is
to
recognize
that
the
dismissal
in
this
context
was
an
inappropriate
way
to
proceed,
treat
it
as
a
stay,
and
therefore
conclude
that
it
was
not
appropriate
to
go
beyond
that,
and
entertain
the
question
of
arbitrability,
because
to
do
that
is
to
create
a
new
class
of
problems
under
section
16
that
otherwise
wouldn't
exist.
we
know
that
if
it's
a
true
independent
action
and
you
order
something
to
arbitration,
then
there's
an
appeal
on
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
that's
the
only
case
like
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
ultimate
question,
it
seems
to
me,
justice
ginsburg,
is
going
to
be
whether
you
treat
form
or
substance
in
this
context
as
the
most
important,
because
it's
pretty
clear
to
me
that
while
the
judge
did,
in
fact,
formally
dismiss
the
action,
what
was
both
required
under
section
3
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
what
we
asked
for
him
to
do
was
to
stay
this.
this
is
the
plaintiff's
choice
of
forum.
there's
no
reason
the
case
couldn't
have
stayed
there.
we
can
respond
directly
to
the
chief
justice's
and
justice
o'connor's
concerns
about
judicial
administration
by
retaining
the
case
under
those
circumstances,
and
we
can
fulfill
the
overall
purposes
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
appellate
review
standards
by
insisting
that
matters,
when
all
doubts
are...
you
know,
when
you
can
resolve
all
doubts
in
favor
of
making
sure
they
go
to
arbitration,
rather
than
go
through
what
we
are
today,
which
is
having
adjudicated
this
issue
at
three
different
levels
of
the
federal
court
system
over
5
years,
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars,
and
we're
no
closer
today
to
resolving
the
merits
of
this
dispute
over
the
15
charge
and
whether
that's
a
finance
charge
or
not--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
there's
no
question--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--there's
no
question
about
that,
justice
souter.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
what
we
need
is
an
answer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
where
we
ought
to
look
for
the
appropriate
legal
standard
is
the
statutory
scheme,
and
i
think
congress
clearly
incorporated
embedded
versus
independent
into
the
subcomponents
of
section
16.
they
clearly
recognize
there
are
independent
proceedings
and
there
are
embedded
proceedings,
and
it
has
specific
rules
about
how
appeals
ought
to
be
followed
in
that
course.
so
to
be
sure,
there
may
be
some
potential
for
manipulation
by
the
parties,
but
i
don't
know
of
much
evidence
to
reflect
that
that's
any
kind
of
a
problem,
and
congress
essentially
bought
into
that
distinction
in
1988
when
it
adopted
the
statute
in
the
form
that
it
did.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
to
be
sure,
congress
could
have
been
clearer
here,
and
i
think
what
the
court
said
in
cortez
byrd
last
term
applies
equally
here,
that
enlightenment
is
not
going
to
come
from
parsing
the
language
of
this
particular
statute.
at
the
end
of
the
day
what
we
know
is
that
the
final
decision
language
in
section
16(a)(3)
covers
the
classic
situation
involving
an
independent
proceeding.
whether
it
should
be
extended
beyond
that
to
a
new
class
of
claims
that
will
interfere
with
the
implementation
of
the
goals
of
arbitration
is
the
issue
before
this
court.
i
find
it
difficult
to
get
passionate
about
this
because
i
believe
justice
souter
is
right,
at
the
end
of
the
day
what
really
matters
is
that
we
have
a
rule.
once
we
have
a
rule,
the
rest
of
us
will
presumably--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--be
able
to
line
up
behind
that
rule.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
that
last
statement
could
be
read
directly
to
apply
to
this
case.
whether
or
not
it
was
meant,
and
whether
congress
adopted
that,
i've
no
idea.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
exactly.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
i
think
it's
quite
obvious
you
would
not
want--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--to
appeal
in
this...
no,
justice
breyer...
that's
wrong.
it
is
clear
to
me
that
you
would
not
want
to
go
through
the
delay
and
forestalling,
allowing
these
matters
to
go
to
arbitration.
that's
what
the
parties
voluntarily
agree
to.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
an
independent
action
you're
talking
about.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no
question.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
because--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it's
not
consistent
in
the
sense
that
if
you
look
at
the
way
16(a)
and
16(b)
are
set
up,
they
really
are
designed
basically
to
say
if
you
have
an
ultimate
order
that
says
arbitrate
you
don't
want
to
go
to
appeal,
and
if
you
don't--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--there
is...
there
is
a--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--there's
a
single
exception,
that's
true,
justice
breyer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
all
i'm
saying
is,
the
question
is,
do
you
want
to
drag
in
another
exception
under
these
circumstances
where
it's
a
perfectly
sensible
to
say,
what
should
have
been
entered
in
here
in
this
context
was
a
stay
that's
not
appealable,
and
in
the
future,
go
on
forward
in
other
cases.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'd
love
to
talk
about
question
2.
thank
you,
justice
o'connor.
[laughter]
obviously,
if
the
court
finds
that
there
is
jurisdiction,
the
hostility
that
i
mentioned
at
the
outset
of
my
argument
applies
with
particular
force
with
respect
to
the
presumption
that
the
court
of
appeals
employed
in
deciding--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--there
may
well
be.
my...
let
me
answer
the
first
part
which
is
that
we
know...
is
that...
is
the
particular
imbalance
in
this
clause
sufficient
to
render
this
unenforceable.
i
don't...
i
don't
understand
the
other
side
to
have
argued
that.
if
they
did
argue
it
below,
they...
clearly
that
was
rejected
because
the
district
court
analyzed
and
dealt
with
all
of
the
unconscionability
issues,
so
i
don't
think
that
issue's
on
the
table.
with
respect...
i
mean,
is
it
possible
to
have
an
arbitration
clause
that
says
in
order
to
get
entry
into
arbitration
you...
you
know,
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
file
a
million
dollars,
i
think
obviously
a
clause
like
that
would
be
unenforceable
under
those
circumstances
because
it
would
interfere
with
the
ultimate
enforcement
of
the
statutory
right,
and
that
is
one
of
the
conditions
of
allowing
arbitration
of
general
statutory
claims,
and
i
don't
have
any
problem
with
that.
the
problem
is
that
if
you
have
a
clause
like
the
one
we
have
in
this
case,
which
is
silent
on
these
issues,
the
clear
presumption,
then,
must
be
that
you
would
favor
arbitration.
you
would
not
assume
all
of
the
costs
are
going
to
be
extreme
or
excessive.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that
is
exactly
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
eleventh
circuit
said
we
will
presume
all
of
the
potential
costs,
large
filing
fees,
pay
for
the
costs
of
the
arbitrator
and
pay
for
everything
else,
without
any
showing
being
made
by
the
plaintiff
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
and
therefore
we're
going
to
say
that
there
is
an
inherent
conflict.
what
i
suggest
to
you
is
that
the
language,
inherent
conflict,
doesn't
remotely
entertain
that
kind
of
an
analysis.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
the
plaintiff
had
the
opportunity
to
make
that
showing.
she
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
engage
in
all
of
the
discovery
she
wanted
to.
she
chose,
on
a
motion
to
reconsider,
to
throw
some
materials
from
the
american
arbitration
association
over
the
transom
to
try
to
make
some
kind
of
a
showing.
the
answer
is,
she
should
go
to
arbitration,
ascertain
whether
the
arbitrator...
whether
the
fees
for
arbitration
would
be
waived,
what
the
costs
of
the
arbitrator
will
be,
and
then,
if
it
turns
out
at
the
end
of
the
day
that
either
those
costs
are
unconscionable
as
a
matter
of
state
law--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
that
the
decision
of
the
court
in
cole
is
completely
premature
for
this
court
to
entertain
at
this
point
in
time,
because
we
don't
know
what
kinds
of
costs
we're
talking
about.
in
the
record
before
the
d.c.
circuit
in
cole,
they
had
some
evidence
about
what
they
thought
the
costs
would
be,
given
the
nature
of
those
claims.
here,
we
have
no
evidence
like
that.
is
it
possible
in
a
particular
case
that
the
court
could
declare
something
unenforceable
because
the
costs
are
too
great?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
as
i
say,
yes,
i
think
you
could
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
don't
disagree
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
you
have
either
of
two
ways
to
try
to
prove
up
your
case,
either
through
discovery,
which
she
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
do,
and
didn't
present
any
evidence
with
respect
to
that,
or,
assuming
that
there's
going
to
be
doubts...
and
i
think
all
doubts,
again,
ought
to
be
resolved
in
favor
of
pushing
toward
arbitration
in
order
to
ascertain
this.
remember,
if
you
read
the
american
arbitration
association's
amicus
brief
it
says
that
they
consistently
waive
their
filing
fees,
they
often
reduce
arbitrator's
fees,
and
we
know...
and
it's
the
reason
why
i
think
it
makes
much
more
sense
for
the
court
to
entertain
these
issues
after
an
arbitration
rather
than
before
an
arbitration...
is
that
we
may
find
out
at
the
end
of
the
day,
if
the
plaintiff
prevails,
that
all
of
those
costs
go
back
to
her,
and
so
she's
really
out
of
pocket
nothing
except
for
the
marginal
costs
during
the
pendency
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
hopefully
that
wouldn't
happen,
obviously,
and
you
wouldn't
expect
it
to
happen
very
often,
but
again
i
don't
disagree
with
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
what
you're
saying
is,
should
the
plaintiff
have
an
opportunity
to
prove
unconscionability
at
the
outset
of
the
process,
i
don't
have
any
problem
with
that,
assuming
she
does
more
than
what
she
did
here,
which
was
to
say,
i'm
not
going
to
arbitration,
i'm
not
going
to
do
anything,
i'm
simply
going
to
put
in
a
study
from
the
aaa
which
may
or
may
not
apply
to
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
i'm
not
even
going
to
ask
green
tree
whether
or
not
they're
willing
to
pay
for
the
fees
in
the
circumstances
a
la
what
the
d.c.
circuit
required
in
the
cole
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
they
make
that
argument,
and
they
ask
the
court
in
this
case
to
affirm
on
that
alternative
ground,
and
our
position
here
is
that
there
is
no
distinction
between
this
case
and
gilmer
with
respect
to
the
treatment
of
class
action.
there
is
no
greater
right
to
a
class
action--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--as
a
matter,
i'm
sorry,
of
what?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
first
view.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
justice
ginsburg,
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
it's
largely
a
matter
of
the
court's
discretion
what
alternative
grounds
which
are
asserted
by
a
party
in
litigation
to
defend
a
judgment
the
court
will
entertain.
they
have
raised
a
class
action
issue.
we
have
responded
to
the
class
action
issue.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
in
a
recent
decision
in
johnson,
which
we
filed
a
supplemental
brief
on,
has
exhaustively
analyzed
the
class
action
issue,
and
the
bottom
line
is
there
is
nothing
in
tila
that
is
any
more
pro
class
action
than
there
was
in
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act,
which
this
court
held
in
gilmer
did
not
prevent
enforceability
of
the
arbitration
clause
in
that
context
and,
indeed,
tila
has
provisions
that
clearly
envision
providing
significant
opportunities
for
plaintiffs
to
recover
in
these
kinds
of
cases.
there
are
statutory
damages
provisions
that
give
significant
moneys
even
without
showing
of
injury--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
there
are
attorney's
fees
and
reasonable
costs.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
the
problem
with
the
situation
is
that
you
don't
presume,
in
the
face
of
silence,
that
there's
going
to
be
a
problem
with
going
to
arbitration.
this
court
has
said
consistently
for
15
years,
in
interpreting
the
relationship
between
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
federal
statutes,
that
we
presume
they
should
go
to
arbitration
and,
if
there
are
gaps,
we
assume
that
the
arbitrator
will
provide
for
them
and
we
know,
as
this
case
comes
to
the
court
at
this
point
based
on
both
what
was
in
the
record
below
and
what
the
amici
briefs
have
shown,
is
that
this
does
not
need
to
be
an
expensive
enterprise.
it
may
not
cost
her
anything
with
respect
to
either
filing
fees
or
arbitrator's
fees.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
am
troubled,
justice
ginsburg,
by
the
idea
that
you
would
adopt
a
rule
judicially
that,
as
a
matter
of
law,
one
party
must
always
front
the
costs
regardless
of
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
case,
and
i
agree
with
you,
to
that
extent
i
think
the
d.c.
circuit's
opinion
is
overbroad.
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
necessarily
be
applied
as
broadly
as
the
language
seems
to
suggest,
but
what
i
do
know
is
that
the
problems
inherent
in
that
kind
of
a
rule,
which
has
not
been
tested
particularly,
are
such
that
it's
completely
premature
for
this
court
to
go
down
that
path.
where
this
court
ought
to
focus
is,
what
was
before
the
district
judge
when
that
court
decided
to
send
it
to
arbitration,
and
what
was
before
that
judge
at
that
time
was,
silence,
which
you
construe
favorably
to
arbitration
and
therefore
send
the
matter
to
arbitration
with
no
further
judicial
review.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
we
said...
we
were
never
asked
specifically
our
views
with
respect
to
this.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
issue
came
up
in
a
motion
to
reconsider,
justice
stevens.
that
was
the
first
time
they
suggested
that
these
costs
were
excessive.
they
did
raise
the
class
action
earlier
in
the
process,
but
they
didn't
raise
the
question
of
costs
specifically
and,
frankly,
even
in
the
eleventh
circuit
the
cost
question
was
more
of
a
second
thought
than
it
was
a
primary
portion
or
focus
of
the
attention
of
the
court.
if
you're
asking
me,
would
we
pay
those
costs
in
most
cases,
i
can
tell
you
that
i
know
that
green
tree
does
pay
those
costs
in
a
lot
of
instances,
but
that's
the
whole
point.
the
plaintiff
has
the
obligation--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--at
least
to
ask
that
question.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
even
if
we
didn't
lose.
we
front
the
costs
at
a
minimum,
and
oftentimes
we
can't
get
those
costs
back.
if
there
are
no
questions,
further
questions,
i'd
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
unless
you
have
further
questions
on
the
jurisdictional
issue,
i'm
going
to
focus
on
the
question
of
enforceability.
it
was
only
at
the
very
tail
end
of
mr.
sellers'
remarks
that
he
identifies
the
fact
that
there
is
a
national
policy
favoring
arbitration,
and
i
don't
think
we
should
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
in
this
context
there
was
a
voluntarily
entered
into
arbitration
clause
that
ought
to
be
enforced
under
these
circumstances,
and
there
are
no
guarantees,
when
you
go
down
arbitration
as
opposed
to
litigation.
we
are
in
a
situation
now
where
we
have
litigated
this
issue
in
three
different
jurisdictions
and
levels
of
this
court.
i
don't
think
anybody
going
in
anticipated
any
of
those
costs,
and
certainly
no
one
is
in
a
position
to
give
a
guarantee
that
any
process
of
dispute
resolution
is
going
to
be
cost
free
or
have
cost
constraints
and,
indeed,
the
plaintiff
never
asked
the
district
court
for
any
of
the
specifics
that
counsel
has
identified
in
the
context
of
this
particular
case.
what
she
said
is,
plaintiff
does
not
have
the
resources
to
arbitrate,
notwithstanding
her
agreement.
therefore,
plaintiff's
only
option
is
to
forego
any
claims
against
this
company.
that
is
the
sum
and
substance
of
her
position
with
respect
to
costs,
not
some
kind
of
more
restrained
action,
and
that's
why
the
district
court
rejected
the
notion--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that
those
costs
were
unconscionable.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there's
no
problem
with
seeking
discovery.
the
question
is,
did
she--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it's
not
in
the
record
in
this
case.
she
sought
some
discovery.
she
didn't
seek
additional
discovery.
those
are
reasonable
choices
litigants
make
every
day,
and
the
point
is,
it's
certainly
not
appropriate
for
this
court
in
a
case
in
which
the
eleventh
circuit
quite
clearly
handled
all
of
this
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
chief
justice
is
absolutely
right.
you
read
17(a)
and
18(a)
and
it
says,
presume
everything
adverse
to
the
lender
in
this
case,
and
only
then
can
you
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
arbitration
clause
should
be
enforced.
that's
clearly
wrong,
as
an
approach
to
this
particular
case,
and
that's
the
judgment
that
ought
to
be
reversed.
the
rest
of
these
issues
i
think
legitimately
ought
to
be
considered
somewhere
down
the
line.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
cole
and
reasonableness
and
unconscionability
are
questions
that
need
to
be
resolved
in
a
framework
that
is
fundamentally
different
from
a
litigant
who
throws
up
her
hands
and
says,
i'm
not
going
to
participate
in
this
particular
process.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
may
be
wrong,
if
we
have
the
right
facts.
i
think
it
is
a
mistake
to
say
categorically
that
the
lender
will
always
pay
the
fees,
regardless
of
the
circumstances
in
a
particular
case.
now,
you
know,
if
the
case
came
up
in
the
right
context,
i
could
well
imagine
the
court
might
adopt
a
view
like
that.
i
could
also
imagine
it
might
adopt
the
dissenting
opinion
in
cole
and
say,
no,
it
still
requires
more
of
a
case
by
case
analysis
in
order
to
properly
balance
the
interests
of
both
sides,
but
the
clear
thing
you
shouldn't
do
is
reject
sending
this
case
to
arbitration
on
a
record
where
the
plaintiff
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
and
chose
simply
to
say
she's
not
going
to
play
in
that
particular
ball
park.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
thank
you,
your
honor.
