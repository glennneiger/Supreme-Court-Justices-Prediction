mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court--
i
am
happy
to
address
the
first
issue
briefly,
and
then
turn
to
the
second
issue,
second
question.
very
importantly,
the
federal
arbitration
act
did
not
divest
the
district
courts
of
discretion
to
dismiss
cases,
as
the
district
judge
did
here,
as
opposed
to
staying
a
case.
therefore,
the
district
court
had
that
discretion,
exercised
the
discretion
and,
as
justice
ginsburg
observed,
i
think
once
the
decision
was
made
to
dismiss
with
prejudice
there
was
nothing
else
left
for
the
court
to
do,
and
that
satisfied
the
classic
standard
of
finality
that
made
it
subject
to
immediate
appellate
review.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
actually,
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
think
that's
a
fair
reading
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
section
3
says
you
must
stay,
but
there's
nothing
inconsistent
about
section
3,
as
the
majority
of
the
circuit
courts
have
recognized,
and
ultimate
dismissal.
section
3
was
designed
to
ensure
that
there
would
be
no
further
pursuit
of
the
merits
of
the
action,
that
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
litigation
of
the
action
in
that
court
until
the
arbitration
concluded.
there's
nothing
improper,
however,
about
a
dismissal
following
that
and,
by
the
way,
if
i
might
just
add,
green
tree
did
ask
to
dismiss
this
case.
they--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--requested--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--alternately,
that's
correct,
and
the
district
court,
if
nothing
else
in
responding
to
green
tree's
request
for
relief,
was
properly...
acted
properly
in
granting
that
request.
but
even
if
green
tree
had
not
requested
the
dismissal,
there's
nothing
impermissible
about
a
dismissal.
again,
i
must
add,
i
don't
think
the
federal
arbitration
act
in
any
respect
divested
the
district
courts
of
a
fundamental
aspect
of
the
discretion--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
that's
correct,
and
the
eleventh
circuit
permit...
was
legitimately
entitled
to
rely
on
the
dismissal
as
a
basis
for
appeal--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--that--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--that
i
think
would
be
reversible
error,
your
honor,
because
i
think
it's
clear
that
that
would
not
be
an
interlocutory...
that
would
be
an
interlocutory--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
but--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--justice
breyer,
i
think
the
rules
could
be
articulated
fairly
clearly
that
will
avoid
the
multiplicity
of
appeals
that
concern
you.
if
there
is
a...
in
the
hypothetical
you
gave,
where
the
referral
to
arbitration
did
not
refer
all
claims
that
were
pending
before
the
court--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--i
think
it
would
be
reversible
error
to
dismiss
the
case,
or
if
it
was
dismissed
it
would
be
treated
as
an
interlocutory
and
the
court
of
appeals
could
legitimately
direct
the
court
to
reinstate
the
case,
and--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
law
is
pretty
clear,
and
the
choices
that
congress
made
in
enacting
section
16(a)3
are
pretty
clear,
and
that
kind
of
scenario
would
not
ordinarily
give
rise
to
an
appealable
order
and
i
think,
as
justice
souter
observed,
once
the
rules
are
set
out
here,
i
think
we
will
all
be
able
to
follow
them.
right
now
there's
some
confusion.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
i'm
sorry.
what
i
meant
was,
it
would
be
reversible
error.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
that
would
be
the
end
of
it.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
right.
if
there
are
no
issues
left
over,
the
court
may
have
some
discretion,
but
it
certainly
is
permissible
to
dismiss,
as
the
district
court
did
here,
and
i
would
ordinarily
think
most
district
courts
would
dismiss
under
those
circumstances,
because
there'd
be
nothing
left
for
the
district
court
to
do.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
16(a)3,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
oh,
i'm
sorry,
section
3.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
section
3.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
forgive
me.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
the
term,
must
stay,
we
read
to
mean
that
it
may
not
permit.
it
is
nondiscretionary,
but
the
key
is
what
it's
nondiscretionary
as
to.
it
may
not...
the
district
court
must
stay
any
litigation
of
the
merits
of
the
underlying
claims.
that
does
not
speak
to
the
question
of
whether
the
district
court
has
discretion,
if
it
refers
the
entirety
of
the
claims
to
arbitration,
to
ultimately
dismiss.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
certainly.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
correct.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
correct,
and
i
think
that's
consistent
with
the
way
congress
would
have
viewed
it
in
1925,
when
it
was
originally
put
in
place.
may
i
turn
to
the
second
issue
that
i
understand
is
also
of
central
concern
to
the
court.
i
think
that
mr.
phillips,
in
using
a
hypothetical,
or
responding
to
a
hypothetical
of
the
court,
illustrates
the
problem
with
costs,
and
the
reason
why
the
circuit
court
was
correct
in
holding
the
agreement
unenforceable
because
of
the
risk
of
the
imposition
of
large
costs.
the
example
given,
well,
suppose
the
plaintiff
was
expected
to
put
up
1
million
in
costs,
or,
if
we
can
be
a
little
more
realistic,
suppose
the
cost
of
arbitration
were
5,000
dollars,
just
the
initial
arbitration
specific
costs,
the
costs
of
filing,
the
cost
of
the
arbitrator,
because
he
or
she's
setting
aside
a
day
or
two
to
come
out,
they
want
to
check
in
advance,
which
often
happens,
suppose
that
they
have
to
rent
a
room,
suppose
there's
a
stenographer,
and
they
want
all
that
payment
up
front.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
well--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
fact,
she
tried
and
she
was
unsuccessful,
but
not
through
any
fault
of
her
own.
i
might
begin
by
noting
that
she...
that
ms.
randolph
did
request,
and
did
mention
costs,
well
before
this
time
of
reconsideration
was--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--well,
the
court
of
appeals
is
relying
on
the
showing
that
ms.
randolph
made
of
the
average
cost
from
a
aaa
survey
because,
notwithstanding
her
request
for
discovery,
and
she
filed
a
motion
for
discovery,
i
might
add,
which
is
found...
it's
docket
number
11
in
the--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--it
was
discovery
with
respect
to
arbitration
procedures.
it
was
not...
it
was
procedures
which
i
think
is
fairly...
could
be
fairly
construed
to
include
costs.
that
motion,
pursuant
to
that
motion
she
eventually
took
a
deposition
pursuant
to
rule
30(b)(6).
that
was
taken
in
december
of
1996.
it
is
not
in
the
record,
and
in
that
deposition
testimony
was
elicited
about
whether
green
tree
was
prepared
to...
the
question
specifically
was
posed
as
to
the
cost
of
arbitration.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
it
is
not
properly
before
the
court,
and
i
want
to
explain
why
it
was
not
put
in
the
record.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
very
well,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
merely
want
to
note
its
existence,
because
i
think
if
the
court
is
not
satisfied
with
the
showing
that
was
made
on
costs,
i
would
like
it
to
entertain
the
request,
or
the
question
that
justice
stevens
put
to
my
colleague,
and
that
is
that
a
remand
be
permitted
so
that
the
record
may
be
more
fully
substantiated.
i
might
add
that
green
tree,
during
the
course
of
this
litigation,
was
asked...
was...
there
was
litigation
over
the
issue
of
costs
both
at
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
green
tree
was
asked
at
oral
argument,
as
is
apparent
from
the
appeal...
from
the
opinion
from
the
eleventh
circuit
about
the
costs,
and
it
was
unprepared
to
say
that
there
were
specific
costs,
or,
as
mr.
phillips
has
now
allowed,
that
they
might
very
well
allow
costs
in
the
outset.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--i
understand--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--i--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--i
understand,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
refer
now
to
the
section
of
the
opinion
that's
found
at
appendix
17(a)
and
(b)...
i'm
sorry,
17(a)
and
18(a),
where
the
eleventh
circuit
refers
to
some
questions
and
answers
given
to
it
by
the...
by
green
tree's
counsel
at
argument,
and
they
asked
about
whether
aaa
rules
are
normally
used.
they
say,
we
don't
typically
do
that.
then
it
says,
the
opinion
on
top
of
page
18(a)
says,
green
tree
also
asserted
at
oral
argument
the
arbitrator
may
apportion
the
fees
of
the
arbitration
in
his
award,
but
that
provides
no
guarantee
that
a
consumer
successfully
arbitrating
under
this
clause
will
not
be
saddled
with
a
prohibitive
cost
order,
and
it
goes
on.
they
were
asked
and
given
an
opportunity,
apparently,
to
indicate
what
are
the
costs
for--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--well,
i
think
that
the...
there
was--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--i
understand,
but
i
think
that's
part
of
the
record
that
we
have
here
as
to
what
those...
there
was
a
consistent
difficulty
in
pinning
down
green
tree
as
to
what
the
costs
were.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
i
understand.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
because...
because,
justice
breyer,
that
would
put
ms.
randolph
in
the
untenable
position
where,
in
the
pursuit
of
a
claim
that
had
economic
damages
of
about
15,
she
would
be
forced
to
go
forward
with
an
arbitration
on
the
presumption
that
the
fees
and
costs
would
ultimately
be
allocable
in
a
fair
way
without
knowing
what
that
would
be--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--and
challenge
it
later.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
what
they
did
offer
was
information
that
was
taken
from
the
aaa
survey.
there
was
information
in
the
record.
it
is
true
that
it
was
not
taken
from
this
case,
and
i
have
explained
the
reason
for
that,
but
that
is
evidence
in
the
record
before
the
district
court
as
to
the
average
costs
of
arbitration
and
filing
fees.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
because...
because,
justice
breyer,
nobody
knows
what
that
means,
and
the...
it
would
cause
her
to
go
for--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--i'm
sorry,
if
i
could
just
finish.
it
would
cause
her
to
go
forward
in
pursuit
of
a
claim
of
very
limited
economic
value
on
the
possibility
at
the
end...
let's
suppose
that
the
fair
way
in
the
mind
of
the
arbitrator
was
to
split
the
costs,
regardless
of
outcome.
each
side
bears
its
own...
bears
half
the
cost
of
the
arbitration,
and
if
the
arbitration
was
5,000
dollars,
and
her
share
was
2,500
dollars,
she
might
very
well
not
go
forward
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
no,
i
don't
think
it
would
be,
but
that
might
be
in
the
eye
of
the
arbitrator,
the
result
that
is
awarded,
and
we
won't
know
that
unless
it's
determined
or
ascertainable
at
the
beginning.
we
don't
take
the
position
that
the
costs
have
to
be
set
forth
specifically
in
the
arbitration
agreement,
but
that
they
be
ascertainable,
and
in
fact
the
american
arbitration
association
last
year
adopted
new
rules
pursuant
to
a
consumer
protocol
which
set
forth
the
provision
that
a
maximum
of
125
must
be
borne
by
the
consumer
and
the
rest
would
be
borne
by
the
company
for
smaller
claims.
that
is
a...
had
this
agreement
simply
said,
we
will
follow
that
kind
of
rule,
or
refer
to
it
an
outside
source
of
that
kind
of
rule,
that
would
have
been
fine.
but
complete
silence.
it
was
even
silent
as
to
whether
there
were
costs.
there
was
not
even
an
indication
that
somebody
who
went
forward
with
an
arbitration
would
have
to
bear
costs.
she'd
have
to
be...
have
to
know
that,
and
have
confidence
that
in
going
forward
there
would
be
a
reasonable...
there'd
be
an
expectation
of
an
allocation
that
is
fair,
whatever
that
means.
we
submit
that
that
kind
of
uncertainty
creates
a
disincentive
to
go
forward
and
enforce
the
rights
under
the
truth
in
lending
act
that
this
court
in
mitsubishi
and
in
gilmer
made
clear
is
the
basis
either
to
decline
to
enforce
the
agreement
altogether
or,
as
was
asked
about
the
cole
decision...
if
i
may
address
it
for
a
moment.
we
understand
there's
a
split
in
the
circuits
as
to
whether,
under
section
4
of
the
federal
arbitration
act,
there
is
any
authority
that
the
district
courts
have
to
insert
provisions
into
an
agreement
to
have
it
conform
with
the
law
as
they
view
it.
whether
or
not
that
authority
exists,
ultimately
the
outcome
ought
to
be
that
the
district
court
should
tell
the
parties,
i
won't
permit
this
to
go
forward
unless
you
spell
out
costs
or
give
the
party
against
whom
the
arbitration
agreement
is
being
enforced
the
opportunity
to
be
assured
that
they're
not
going
to
bear
costs
beyond
those
that
would
be...
they
would
ordinarily
expect
if
they
went
forward
in
court.
that
is
the
forum
that
they
chose.
if
the...
if
judicial
and
arbitral
forums
are
to
be
comparable,
you
can't
impose
on
one
party
costs
well
in
excess,
or
create
the
risk
that
they
would
bear
those
costs--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
and
of
course
if
the
plaintiff
did
that,
she...
ms.
randolph
would
have
already
incurred
costs
going
forward--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--even
if
she
later
wanted
to
back
out.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
well,
and
maybe
the
costs...
you'd
have
part
of
the
costs
of
the
arbitrator,
and
again,
i
must
add,
the
arbitrator
said,
as
again,
people
who
are
busy
and
expected
to
arbitrate
cases
are
often
called
upon
to
do,
i'm
going
to
have
to
bill
you
for
a
day
because
i've
set
aside
all
my
other
work
in
order
to
attend
to
this
arbitration,
so
if
you
take
10
minutes
or
10
hours,
that's
the
time
i'm
charging
you
for.
that
is
a
cost...
that
is
a
risk
that
a
prudent
person
i
don't
think
ought
to
be
expected
to--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--well,
again,
i...
we
submit
that...
we
understand
that
that
determination
may
and
properly
should
ultimately
be
made
by
an
arbitration,
but
costs
are
really
unique,
and--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
okay.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
uh
huh.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
i
understand.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
justice
breyer,
i
certainly
think
you
could
do
that,
but
i
think
the
key
to
it
is
that
it
be
established
at
the
outset,
and
not
at
the
end
of
the
arbitration.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
yes,
i
think
the
district
court
had
that
authority,
and
could
and
should
have
exercised
some
additional
authority
in
telling
the
parties
at
that
juncture,
before
it
sent
them
off
to
arbitration,
i
am
concerned
about
the
silence
on
costs.
i
believe...
i
want
to
give
effect
to
this
agreement.
i
believe
that's
the
intention
of
the
parties.
but
i
am
also
concerned
about
the
potential
imposition
of
excessive
costs.
in
alabama
there's
a
customer
usage
provision,
and
i
want
to
establish,
before
i
send
this
off
to
arbitration,
or
have
a
initial
conference
with
the
arbitrator
to
determine
at
no
expense
to
the
parties
what
cost
is
going
to
be
assessed,
and
how
it's
going
to
be
allocated,
and
at
that
point
go
forward
and
arbitrate.
that
would
satisfy
us.
but
it's
got
to
be
done
at
the
outset,
not
at
the
end,
because
at
that
point
you
bear
the
costs,
you're
stuck
with
them,
or,
as
in
the
case
of
ms.
randolph,
you're
so
deterred
by
the
possibility
of
excessive
costs
that
you
won't
go
forward,
and
that's
the
prospective
waiver
of
the
tila
claims
that
this
court
has
expressed
concern
if
it
were
to
arise.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
we
don't
want
that
to
happen
either.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
i'm
sorry,
i
misunder...
i
didn't
understand
the
question.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
oh,
yes.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
correct.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
correct.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
correct.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
that's...
either...
either,
justice
ginsburg,
either
the
d.c.
circuit
and
cole's
approach
is
acceptable,
or
the
approach
i
was
suggesting
to
justice
breyer,
which
is
that
the
court
convene
the
parties,
say
to
them,
you
have
to
pencil
in
this
cost
rather
than
the
court
doing
it,
and...
because
i'm
not...
i
want
to
enforce
this
agreement,
and
i
understand
you
both
agree
to
it,
but
we
need
to
spell
out
these
costs.
so
it's
either
the
district
court
does
it
as
the
cole
court
endorsed
at
the
outset,
or,
instead,
the
parties
are
directed
to
do
it.
but
it's
always
at
the
outset,
before
they're
compelled
to
go
to
arbitration.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
the
specific
course?
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
the--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--no,
not
in
those
words,
but
yes,
insofar
as
we
are...
forgive
me
for...
i
feel
a
need
to
explain
my
answer.
yes,
insofar
as
we
argued
to
the
eleventh
circuit
that
there...
they
had
an
option
that
was
other
than
simply
to
invalidate
the
agreement
in
its
entirety,
that
the
cost
had
to
be
established
up
front.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
no,
i
didn't
present
the
options
in
the
way
i've
just
presented
to
the
court
today,
but
i
think
that
it's
reasonable
to
infer
that
if
the
district
court
regarded
itself
as
lacking
authority
to
pencil
in
anything
as
the
cole
court
allowed
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
that's
clear,
and
it
is
also
clear
that
there
was
issue
about
the
cost
presented
to
the
district
court,
and
about
their
being
excessive,
and
the
record
was
developed.
whether
it
was
sufficient
on
the
costs
in
that
case
or
not
to
satisfy
the
court,
i
think
we
may
have
a
difference
of
opinion,
but
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
issue
of
costs
was
raised
early,
and
it
was
raised
several
times.
it
was
not
a
last
minute
concern,
and
it
was
raised
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
same
fashion.
and
if
i
might
add,
if
i
can
turn
for
just
a
moment
to
the
class
action
issue,
which
i
understand
was
not
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals,
because
it
apparently
didn't
feel
it
needed
to
reach
the
issue,
but
i
think
at
least
i
want
to
make
clear
that
much
the
same
kind
of
approach
we
advanced
here
could
be
taken
with
respect
to
the
class
action
issue.
ms.
randolph
has
taken
the
position
here
that,
not
that
class
actions
under
truth
in
lending
act
are
always
exempt
from
arbitration.
any
time
a
lawyer
styles
a
case
as
a
class
action
it's
exempt
from
arbitration.
that
is
not
the
position
that
we've
taken
here.
the
position
is
likewise,
the
agreement
was
silent
on
class
actions.
the
district
court
viewed
it
as
silence
meant
it's
excluded.
that's
the
end
of
the
discussion,
even
though
the
district
court
expressed
some
sympathy
for
ms.
randolph's
concerns
about
aggregating
small
consumer
claims
in
the
absence
of
that,
the
parties
being
left
with
no
recourse,
and
i
submit
that
once
again
the
district
court
could
have
and
should
have
been
able
to
say
to
the
parties,
i
see
also
that
ms.
randolph
has
styled
this
case
as
a
class
action.
i
believe
that
the
truth
in
lending
act,
while
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
contemplates
class
actions,
but
more
importantly,
congress
made
it
clear,
echoing
the
views
of
the
federal
reserve
board,
that
there
was
great
importance
attached
to
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
through
class
actions.
and
the
district
judge
could
have
said
and
should
have
said,
i
think
that
the
view...
i
don't
know
whether
you
intend
to
include
class
actions
here,
although
green
tree
had
already
made
its
position
clear
by
opposing
class
certification,
that
it
presumably
didn't
want
it
and
may
very
well
have
hoped
that
it
would
never
see
another
class
action
again
and
these
kinds
of
boiler
plate
agreements.
but
that
i'm
going
to
send
this
to
arbitration,
but
i
want
you
to
understand
that
i
regard...
the
district
court
says
this,
i
regard
class
action
to
be
an
option,
either
left
to
the
arbitrator
to
determine
whether
to
certify
the
class,
or
for
the
district
court
itself
to
determine
whether
to
certify
the
class,
and
then,
upon
review
at
the
end,
to
satisfy
itself
that
the
interests
of
absent
class
members
have
been
adequately
protected.
i
think
the
district
court
viewed
its
role
in
a
way
that
was
much
too
passive
for
the
circumstances
of
the
federal
arbitration
act,
but
we
do
not
take
the
position,
and
i
want
to
be
very
clear
about
it,
that
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
all
tila
claims
should
be
exempt
from
arbitration,
or
even
all
tila
class
actions
should
be
exempt
from
arbitration,
nor
that
the
district
court
was
without
recourse
to
have
the
parties
put
in
place
some
assurances
about
cost,
or
to
actually
insert
a
provision
about
cost,
as
the
cole
court
seems
to
have
contemplated.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
well,
certainly
mastrobuono
allows
for
that
possibility,
this
court's
decision
in
mastrobuono.
we
also
recognize,
however,
that
there's
a
strong
policy
favoring
the
enforcement
of
appropriate
arbitration
agreements,
and
all
we
are
saying
here
is
that
either
there
has
to
be,
as
the
eleventh
circuit
did,
a
conclusion
that
the
agreement
is
not
enforceable,
or
the
district
courts
could
have
some
discretion
to
ensure
that
the
parties
put
in
place
at
the
outset,
not
at
the
end
of
the
arbitration
process,
but
at
the
outset,
mechanisms
to
ensure
that
these
kinds
of
protections--
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
--justice
breyer,
it
would
be...
might
be
state
law,
but
the
district
court
treated...
interpreted
the
question
in
the
context
of
section
4
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
mr.
joseph
m.
sellers
the
class
action
issue.
it
never
got
to
the
question
of
whether
class
certification
was
warranted
under
state
law.
it
stopped
at
the
issue
of,
it's
silent,
therefore
i
have
no
discretion
to
consider
it,
and
then
expressed
some
sympathy
for
the
plaintiff's
view
that
class
action
might
be
appropriate
here,
but
i
have
no
authority
to
interpret
this
silent...
this
agreement
that
was
silent
on
this
as
permitting
class
actions.
that,
i
think,
is
a
view
of
its
role,
the
district
court's
role
that
is
too
passive,
given
this
statute.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i'll--
