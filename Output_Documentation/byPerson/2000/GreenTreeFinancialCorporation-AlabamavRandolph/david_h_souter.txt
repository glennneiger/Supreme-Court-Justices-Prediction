david
h.
souter
sure,
but
if
you
lose
this
case
it
won't
take
another
5
years
and
another
case,
because
everybody
will
know
pretty
much
where
we
stand.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
the
problem
of
the
long
litigation
here
is
that
you've
got
an
unresolved
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you
said
the...
we
should
see
this
as
a
choice
of
form
versus
substance.
haven't
we
got
a
form
versus
substance
problem,
in
effect,
whichever
way
we
go?
i
understand
your
form
and
substance
argument
here,
but
if
we
follow
the
embedded
independent
distinction
we've
got
a
form
and
substance
problem,
too,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
follow
the
embedded
independent
distinction
we
are
in
effect
going
to
be
leaving
it
up
to
a
matter
of
pleading
in
a
great
many
instances
as
to
what
the
appealability
may
be,
and
let
me
just
throw
out
the
suggestion
that
we
might
be
better
off
to
let
district
judges,
in
effect,
make
the
form
substance
distinction
and
decide
the
appealability
question
than
leave
it
to
parties
who
are
pleading
to
make
that
distinction
for
us.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
this
is
discovery
going
to
the
costs
of
the
arbitration?
