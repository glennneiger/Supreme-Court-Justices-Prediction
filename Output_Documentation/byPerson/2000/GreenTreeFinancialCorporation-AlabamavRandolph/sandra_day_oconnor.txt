justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
phillips,
there
was
a
crucial
difference
here.
the
court
purported
to
dismiss
all
the
claims.
it
didn't
just
enter
a
stay
order,
as
would
typically
be
the
case.
it
said
everything
else
is
dismissed,
and
i
take
it
that
would
mean
then
that
the
statute
of
limitations
might
run
before
the
case
ever
got
back,
or
something
like
that,
and
isn't
there
a
real
difference
between
the
entry
of
a
stay
order
pending
the
arbitration
versus
a
dismissal?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
we
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute
dealing
with
the
final
decision,
we
look
at
the
fact
that
it
was
a
dismissal,
so
we
say,
okay,
there's
jurisdiction.
now
are
you
going
to
talk
about
question
2?
