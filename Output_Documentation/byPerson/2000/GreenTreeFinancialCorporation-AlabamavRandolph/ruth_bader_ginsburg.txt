justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
is
that
wrong,
mr.
phillips,
if
what
the
district
judge
says
is,
gee,
there's
nothing
before
me,
i
think
every
single
issue
in
this
case
belongs
in
the
arbitral
forum,
so
i'm
going
to
dismiss,
and
i
look
at
section
3.
what
i
see
that
as
telling
me
is,
don't
move
forward.
it's
not
stay
versus
dismissal,
but
it's
stay
versus
letting
the
case
continue.
why
should
a
district
judge
who
says,
there's
nothing
to
come
back
to
me,
this
is
not
a
case
where
some
issues
are
to
be
referred
to
other...
to
the
arbitral
forum,
and
then
there
are
other
issues
that
i'll
decide
after
the
arbitration.
why
isn't
it
perfectly
proper
for
a
district
judge
to
say,
there's
nothing
here
for
me
to
decide,
everything
is
for
the
arbitrator?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
issues?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
issues?
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it,
i
understand
the
formal
distinction.
this
is
the
plaintiff
consumer
suing
rather
than
an
action
to
order
arbitration,
but
it
seems
to
me
even
if
you're
right
that
the
district
judge
should
have
stayed,
what
in
fact
happened
was
the
district
judge
dismissed,
total,
case
gone,
and
that
seems
to
me
as
final
a
judgment
as
there
could
be.
you
could
argue,
he
shouldn't
have
done
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
like
erroneously
entering
summary
judgment,
we
don't
say
it
isn't
the
final
judgment.
judge
says,
i
award
summary
judgment
to
defendant.
plaintiff
says,
gee,
judge,
you
shouldn't
have
done
that,
but
it
doesn't
make
the
judgment
any
less
final
that
the
judge
maybe
should
have
done
something
other
than
dismiss.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
doesn't
matter
how
you
style
it.
you've
got
something
before
you.
you've
held
onto
something.
it
doesn't
matter
what
label
you
pin
to
it.
if
a
district
judge
disassociates
itself
from
the
case,
that's
the
classic
definition
of
a
final
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
district
judge
says,
out.
this
case
isn't
here
any
more,
gone,
as
distinguished
from,
i'm
entering
an
interlocutory
order.
it's
not
what's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
when
you
say
treat
it
as--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--when
you
say
treat
it
as,
you're
already
saying...
this
district
judge
says,
dismissed.
treat
it
as,
district
judge,
your
wrong,
you
should
not
have
dismissed,
we
have
to
review
and
reverse
at
least
that
much
to
say,
you
should
not
have
dismissed
the
case,
you
should
have
stayed
it.
so
i
could
see
if
you're
right
about
that,
that
the
proper
result
here
is
always
stay,
never
dismiss,
then
the
court
of
appeals
says,
this
judge
was
wrong
in
dismissing,
we
certainly
have
to
review
that,
that's
as
final
as
it
could
be,
and
on
the
merits
of
that
decision
to
dismiss,
just
as
we
would
do
with
a
summary
judgment,
we
say,
district
judge,
you're
wrong,
you
had
no
authority
to
dismiss,
you
should
have
stayed.
i
don't
know
that
courts
of
appeals
treat
dismissals
that
are
wrong
as
if
the
judge
had
not
dismissed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
phillips,
from
what
you
just
said
i
take
it
you
disagree
with
the
d.c.
circuit.
the
d.c.
circuit
said,
plaintiffs,
employees...
and
i
take
it
consumers
would
fall
in
that
same
boat.
they're
going
to
not
go
to
an
arbitration
if
they're
gong
to
face
the
possibility,
which
they
never
face
in
court...
in
court,
they
don't
have
to
pay
the
judge.
arbitrators
sometimes
charge
a
lot
of
money
per
hour
of
their
time,
so
unless
the
contract
says,
or
unless
the
court
reads
into
the
contract
that
the
seller
in
this
case,
or
the
finance
company,
the
employer
in
that
case,
pays
at
least
for
the
judge,
then
this
would
be
an
unconscionable
arrangement.
you
can't
require
the
consumer
or
the
employee
to
pay
the
judge,
and
that
has
to
be
clear.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
she
had
other
reasons,
too,
and
one
the
eleventh
circuit
didn't
deal
with
because
they
didn't
have
to,
and
that
is,
she
said,
i
don't
have
to
go
to
arbitration
because
under
the
truth
in
lending
act
i
have
a
right
to
make
this
a
class
action
and
i'm
not
going
to
get
the
class
action.
the
eleventh
circuit,
as
i
understand
it,
said
we're
not
going
to
address
that
issue
because
we've
already
decided
she
has
to
have
security
that
she's
not
going
to
have
to
pay
for
the
arbitrator
under
any
circumstances.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
we
can't
address
that
as
a
matter
of
first
view.
i
mean,
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--first
view.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
eleventh
circuit
didn't
address
it
at
all.
it
said,
that's
a
question
we
leave
open.
we
don't
have
to
get
to
it
on
our
theory
of
the
case.
our
theory
of
the
case
is
that
the
party
seeking
arbitration
has
to
pay
the
arbitrator,
period.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
we...
so
at
least
i
feel
that
the
class
that
question,
whether
there
could
be
arbitration
at
all
because
of
the
class
action
provision
of
the
truth
in
lending
act,
we
can't
address
that
in
this
proceeding
because
it
hasn't
been
aired
below.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the...
you're
saying
there's
enough
in
here--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--for
us
to
deal
with
the
class
action
issue,
but
you've
mentioned
gilmer
more
than
once,
and
one
of
the
things
about
gilmer
that
struck
me
is
that
the
securities
industry
said,
unlike
what
you're
saying...
you
say,
wait
and
see.
let's
see
what
the
arbitrator
does.
we're
not
going
to
tell
you
one
way
or
the
other.
the
securities
industry
said,
we
pay
for
the
judge,
and
so
that
was
out
of
the
case.
when
gilmer
came
to
this
court
it
was
presented
with
a
situation
where
the
employee
was
not
going
to
have
to
pay
the
cost
of
the
arbitrator
because
the
party
seeking
arbitration,
the
securities
industry,
said,
what...
don't
worry
about
that.
we
pay
the
arbitrator.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
taking
this
position
you
have
to
be
saying
the
d.c.
circuit
not
only
was
premature,
but
it
was
just
wrong.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
as
i
read
the
d.c.
circuit
they
said,
to
make
this
contract
fair
and
enforceable,
it
must
be
not
the
arbitrator's
decision,
it
must
be,
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
the
party
seeking
arbitration
pays
for
the
arbitrator,
as
a
matter
of
law,
not
for
the
individual
arbitrator
to
decide
in
each
arbitration.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
sellers,
if
you
took
the
position
that
i
thought
mr.
phillips...
he
will
straighten
us
out
on
it...
was
embracing
at
this
argument,
although
not
in
his
brief,
that
alabama...
the
amici,
the
housing
institute
took,
they
said,
yeah,
you
could
say
this
was
a
dismissal
in
the
final
judgment,
but
the
eleventh
circuit
should
say,
district
judge,
you're
wrong,
because
you
don't
have
any
authority
to
dismiss.
you
must
stay,
because
section
3
says
must
stay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
alternately--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--alternately
they--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
court
of
appeals
would
then
instruct
the
district
judges,
when
there's
something
left
over,
of
course
you
don't
enter
a
final
dismissal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
would
be...
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the...
so
the
court
of
appeals
would
take
it
to
final
judgment
and
then
say,
if
there
are
issues
left
over,
you
must
stay,
not
dismiss.
if
there
are
no
issues
left
over,
then
it
was
perfectly
proper
to
dismiss.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
your
take
on
the
argument
that
was
made
in
that
amicus
brief
that
under
section...
is
it
3?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
16(a)3,
the
words
say,
must
stay.
it
doesn't
say--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
section--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--section
3.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
okay.
i
didn't
want
to
detain
you
on
that.
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure
that
you
recognized--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
saying
if--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
sellers,
that
if
the
eleventh
circuit
had
taken
the
d.c.
circuit
route,
that
is,
not
tossed
out
this
arbitration,
which
would
allow
your
client...
as
i
understand
the
posture
now,
your
client
can
go
into
court
with
a
truth
in
lending
act
suit
and
is
freed
from
the
yoke
of
arbitration,
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
i
understand
the
eleventh
circuit
decision--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--this
contract
is
no
good.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
therefore,
your
client
can
go
to
court--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
bring
a
truth
in
lending
act--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--action,
class
action
and
the
works.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
have
indicated
that
you
would
have
found
acceptable
the
d.c.
circuit
solution,
which
is
the
arbitration
agreement
is
preserved,
we
just
read
in
the
provision
that
we
think
is
necessary
to
make
it
enforceable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
why
should
the
district
court
do
that?
i
mean,
if
you're
right,
why
not
say,
we
construe
the
contract
against
the
drafter,
the
drafter
didn't
put
it
in,
so
the
contract
is
no
good?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
notion
that
she
wanted
to
have--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--discovery
into
what
the
arbitration
proceeding
would
be,
and
why
couldn't
one
assume
that
that
discovery
would
inevitably
involve
issues
about
the
costs
of
arbitration?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
that
she
was
told
she
couldn't
have
discovery
in
the
district
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
including
whether--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
are
asking
us
to
reject
the
d.c.
circuit
solution.
that
is,
in
contrast
to
the
eleventh
circuit
that
said,
no
arbitration,
you
can
have
your
suit
in
court,
the
d.c.
circuit
said,
you
must
go
to
arbitration
but
we're
going
to
relieve
the
party
resisting
arbitration,
relieve
her
of
the
anxiety
of
thinking
she's
going
to
have
to
pay
costs
by
telling
her
that's
a
term
of
law
that
we...
not
asking
the
district
court
to
do
it,
the
court
of
appeals
saying
we
write
that
into
the
contract.
what
is...
you
said
it
was
premature.
is
it
wrong?
