chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
99-1235,
the
green
tree
financial
corporation
v.
larketta
randolph.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
can
understand
your
characterization
of
the
second
holding
that
way
about
the
possibility
that
the
arbitration
might
entail
costs,
but
the
jurisdictional
holding,
do
you
think
that
manifests
a
hostility
to
arbitration?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying
in
effect
that
the
burden
is
on
the
person
challenging
the
fairness
of
the
clause
to
show
some
unfairness--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
that
the,
what,
the
eleventh
circuit
here
just,
without
any
showing
on
the
part
of
the...
that
party
simply
said
because
it
might--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
phillips,
supposing
that,
unlike
the
case
here,
the
person
objecting
to
arbitration
had
made
a
significant
showing
in
the
district
court,
not
going
to
arbitration
but
saying,
look,
here
are
some
figures
from
past
arbitrations;
we
think
this
is
going
to
be
just
like
this
one;
the
party
who
wanted
to
go
to
arbitration
doesn't
contradict
that;
the
district
court
says
yes,
these
kind
of
costs
are
going
to
be
incurred
in
the
arbitration,
and
therefore
it's
unconscionable.
i
don't
see
why
the...
that
party
should
have
to
go
to
arbitration
if
they
can
make
a
persuasive
showing
to
the
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
supposing
the
arbitration,
say,
goes
on
for
a
week,
and
the
arbitrator's
time
is
consumed,
and
the
plaintiff's,
and
the
defendant's,
and
then
it
turns
out
that
a
court
is
going
to
find
the
arrangements
were
unconscionable,
that
the
plaintiff
was
required
to
put
up
thousands
of
dollars,
or
the
party
objecting,
and
so
you've
basically
spun
your
wheels
in
the
arbitration
proceeding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
sellers,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
even
if
there
is
something
improper
about
a
dismissal,
it's
nonetheless
a
dismissal--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--isn't
it?
i
don't
think
we're
in
the
habit
of
looking
into
whether
the
dismissal
was
correct
or
not
and
deciding
whether
something
was
appealable.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you...
you're
necessarily
requiring...
required
to
say
suppose,
mr.
sellers,
because
your
client
made
no
showing
below.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
rely
on
any
showing.
the
court
of
appeals
just
speculated.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
now,
are
you...
if
it's
not
in
the
record,
is
it
properly
before
us?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
it
isn't
in
the
record,
and
it's
not
properly
before
the
court,
i
should
think
that
would
be
the
end
of
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
understand
its
opinion,
didn't
talk
about
actual
costs.
it
simply
said
that
because
these
might...
these
things
might
happen.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
know,
you've
put
the
burden--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--basically
on
the
parties
seeking
arbitration,
rather
than
on
the
party
challenging
the
arbitration.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
question
the
propriety
of
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
the
burden
be
on
them?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
weren't
challenging
the
arbitration
agreement.
your
client
was.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
don't
think
that--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
don't
think
that's
necessarily
correct,
mr.
sellers.
conceivably
some,
you
know,
proof
could
be
offered
in
the
district
court,
before
the
arbitration,
that
the
fees
would
be,
you
know,
way,
way
out
of
proportion,
but
it
just
wasn't
done
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
did
you
argue
that
to
the
eleventh
circuit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
answer
yes
or
no,
can't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
sellers.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
the
case
is
submitted.
