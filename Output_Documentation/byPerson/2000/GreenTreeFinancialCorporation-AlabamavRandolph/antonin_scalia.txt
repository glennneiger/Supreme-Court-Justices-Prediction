well,
it
did
set
forth
specific
rules,
but
it
certainly
didn't
adopt
the
embedded

as
a
test
for
anything
else,
and
the
word
it
used
for
appealability
was
a
classic
word
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
embedded
versus
nonembedded.
i
mean,
if
that's
what
they
meant
by
final,
you
know,
final
decision,
they
should
have
said
something
else.
it's
a
very
strange
word
to
use
to
convey
embedded
versus
nonembedded.

i
don't
understand
what
you
mean
by

it's
dismissed
it
would
be
treated
as
interlocutory.
