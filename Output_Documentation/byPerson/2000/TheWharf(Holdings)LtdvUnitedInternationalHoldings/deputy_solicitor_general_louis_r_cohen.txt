mr.
louis
r.
cohen
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
uih
pleaded
and
the
jury
found
that
uih
purchased
a
security,
an
option,
and
paid
for
that
separate
security
with
services
that
wharf
requested
and
crucially
needed.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
thank
you.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
it
was
both
a
purchase
and
a
separate
attempt
to
exercise.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
in
the
spring
of
1993,
after
wharf
got
the
cable
franchise
from
the
broadcast
authorities.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
wharf
had
conducted
a
public
offering,
raised
the
money,
called
mr.
ing
and
sought
to
exercise
the
option.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
it
could
not
be.
its
terms
were
that
uih
would
have
the
option,
and
had
bought
the
option.
in
return
for
these
massive
services,
it
would
have
the
option
to
invest
ten
percent
of
the
capital
required
by
this
newly
formed
company
and
get
ten
percent
of
the
stock.
that
option
would
be
exercisable...
this
is
all
in
our
complaint...
would
be
exercisable
for
six
months
after
the
award
of
the
franchise
to
wharf
cable
by
the
broadcast
authority,
because
without
that
award
there
would
be
nothing.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
they
do.
[laughter]
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well,
the
cost
of
providing
the
services
with
which
we
purchased
the
option
was
about
a
million
dollars
out
of
pocket,
but
it
was
the
time
of
people
who
were
investors
in
these
businesses.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well,
there
was
a
good
deal
of
testimony
at
trial--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--it
was
a
handshake
deal
that
had
been
preceded
by
a
written
reference
to
an
option
in
the
bid
that
wharf
submitted
to
the
broadcast
authority,
that
language
was
pulled
at
the
last
minute.
it's
an
option
that
is
referenced
in
later
internal
wharf
documents.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
and
uih
would
have
been
well
advised
to
come
out
of
that
meeting,
call
its
lawyer
and
say
how
do
we
document
this?
but
the
agreement
at
that
meeting
was
that
documentation
would
be
prepared.
the
agreement
at
that
meeting
also
was
that
wharf
needed--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--yes,
because
wharf--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--the
kind
of
person
you're
talking
about
is
a
person
who
is
a
victim
of
an
unscrupulous
securities
salesman
who
calls
up
and
says
i've
got
an
oil
company
here,
and
i've
got
some
shares
to
sell
you,
and
fails
to
say
there
isn't
any
oil
and
says
give
me
your
credit
card
number,
or
send
me
a
check
and
i'll
send
you
a
certificate.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
you
have
a
fraud
if
there--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--if--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
think
yes.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes,
because
i
think--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--no,
because
i
think
there
is
a
contract.
i
don't
think
i
need
that
one.
i
think
my
case
is
much
easier.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
any
time
someone
has
a
provable,
enforceable
contract
to
buy
a
share
of
stock--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--justice
breyer,
what
we
have
here
is
not
merely
an
executory
contract
to
purchase
some
stock.
we
have
a
completed,
consummated
contract
to
sell
and
purchase
an
option
which
is
a
separate
security
as
defined--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--he
hasn't--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--he
hasn't
been
defrauded
out
of
anything
except
perhaps
driving
fast
to
deliver
the
pizza.
we
have
been
defrauded
out
of
services...
the
valuable
services...
that
we
undertook
to
deliver
only
because
wharf
agreed
to
grant
and
granted
us
an
option.
that
option
is
a
separate
security
which
we
were
then--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--well,
let
me
say
this
about
the
policy.
first,
there
is
the
difference
between
a
mere
breach
of
contract
and
an
intent
at
the
time
that
a
contract
is
entered
into
not
to
perform,
and
several
courts
of
appeals
have
spoken
to
that.
second,
we
are
talking
here
about
the
defendants'
intention
quite
different
from
the
problem
in
blue
chip
of
the
plaintiff
proving
the
plaintiff's
own
intention
by
his
own
affidavit,
an
inherently
untestable
thing
that
gets
into
the
jury
to
get
past
the
defendant's
intention,
a
statement
that
he
intended
to
fulfill
the
contract,
the
plaintiff
is
going
to
have
to
come
up
with
some
concrete
evidence.
we
had
that
evidence
here...
written
evidence
from
wharf's
files
that
wharf
did
not
intend
at
the
time
that
it
entered
into
the
contract
to
fulfill
it.
and
furthermore,
congress
has
taken
much
of
this
burden
off
the
court's
shoulders,
if
you'll
excuse
me
for
just
a
second,
by
adding
the
requirement
in
the
private
securities
litigation
reform
act
of
1995
in
which
it
recognized
a
10(b)(5)
claim
and
cited
how
to
cabin
it,
and
it
requires
a
specific
pleading
of
facts
sufficient
to
create
a
quote
strong
inference
of
intent
to
defraud,
and
if
you
can't
do
that,
your
claim
is
dismissed
under
that
statute.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
so
that
policy
has
been
addressed.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
no.
blue
chip
was
interpreting
the
statute.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
the
statute
requires
a
purchaser--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
don't--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--the
difference
is
that
we
have
a
completed
purchase.
we
have
a
completed
purchase
that
is
sustained
by
testimony--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--let
me
say
one
other
thing
about
blue
chip--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
think
it
makes
no
difference
to
the
outcome.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well,
first,
of
course,
it
was
valid
under
the
colorado
securities--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--no,
i
don't
think
you
would
be--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
death
knell.
i'm
trying
to
answer
the
question.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
think
the
sale
of
a
security
that
is
an
invalid
security
that
is
represented
to
be
a
security
is
sufficient
under
blue
chip
to
support
a
10(b)(5)
claim,
whether
the
security
is
enforceable
or
not,
and
i
think
the
majority
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
agreed
with
that.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well,
it
has
to
have
a
security--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--the
promise...
that
promise
is
not
an
option
on
my
view.
an
option
is
a
security
that
you
pay
separate
consideration
for
that
gives
you
the
right
but
not
the
obligation
to
purchase
another
security.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
that's
what
we
have
here.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
what
i've
tried
to
say
is
that
you
can
decide
this
case
in
my
favor
without
reaching
that
by
determining...
agreeing
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
what
you
had
here
was
a
completed
actual
paid
for
sale
of
a
different
security,
an
option
which
the
parties
intended
to
document
but
didn't
end
up
documenting,
because
that
was
part
of
the
fraud,
and
then
there
was
a--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--the
statute
of
frauds--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--it
was,
and
we
paid
for
it
in
services
that
had
a
cost
to
us
of
about
a
million
dollars,
and--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--justice
scalia,
first
of
all,
the
present
statute
in
colorado
and
every
other
state
says
sales
of
securities
are
enforceable
without
a
writing.
there
is
no
statute
of
frauds
applicable
to
securities.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
and
at
the
time
there
was
a
statute
of
frauds
which
was
determined
not
to
apply
because
of
the...
because
of
wharf's...
because
of
uih's
completed
performance
of
its
obligations.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
performance
took
this
out
of
the
statute
of
frauds.
excuse
me.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
think
you
should
say
that
the
question
whether
there
has
been
a
sale
of
securities
is
a
question
of
state
law,
as
it
has
been.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes,
i
think
whether
the
resulting
contract
fits
the
definition
of
a
security
is,
of
course,
a
question
of
federal
law.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes,
as
a
matter
of--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--matter
of
state
law.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
no.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
no.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
what
we
had
was
not
a
unilateral
contract.
it
was
a
bilateral
contract
as
the
jury
found.
wharf
sold
us
an
option
on
april
8...
on
october
8,
1992.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes,
we
were.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes,
we
did.
but
we
also...
but
we
promised
to
do--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--yes,
there
was.
there
was
a
performance
of
our
contract
to
acquire
an
option
by
providing
services
that
wharf
requested
which
included
dispatching
named
people
immediately
to
hong
kong
at
our
expense
to
serve
as
officers
of
wharf
cable--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--we
could
have
been
sued
if
we
hadn't
done
that.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
it
wasn't
an
if.
they
granted...
they
entered
into
a
contract...
this
is
a
jury
finding
on
a
stipulated
verdict
forum...
they
entered
into
a
contract
granting
uih
an
option.
in
that
contract,
granting
us
an
option,
we
promised,
and
immediately
did,
pay
for
that
option
by
providing
required
services.
there
was
a
completed
actual
sale
here.
that's
what
this
trial
was
about
for
eleven
weeks.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
you
need
to
prove
that
at
day
one
there
was
no
intent
to
perform.
you
need
to
get
past
some...
motion
to
dismiss,
to
have
concrete
evidence
of
that,
and
there
needs
to
be
a
completed
contract...
completed
sale...
in
connection
with
it,
which
that
misrepresentation
is
made.
