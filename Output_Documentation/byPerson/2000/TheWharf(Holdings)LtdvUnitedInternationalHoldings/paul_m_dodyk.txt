mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
let
me
start
by
suggesting
that
whether
my
client
wharf
holdings
misrepresented
its
intention
to
sell
stock
of
wharf
cable
to
uih
is
a
matter
of
no
concern
under
the
'34
act.
the
paradigm
section
10(b)
plaintiff
is
an
investor
who
has
purchased
a
security
which
has
been
inflated
by
deception,
the
price
of
which
was
been
inflated
by
deception
or
manipulation.
i
submit
the
central
purpose
of
the
'34
act
is
to
protect
such
investors
from
financial
loss.
the
'34
act,
i
submit,
was
not
passed
to
provide
a
federal
remedy
to
plaintiffs
who
complained
of
their
inability
to
purchase
stock.
the
'34
act
was
not
passed
for
the
purpose
of
federalizing
the
adjudication
of
disputes
over
the
ownership
of
securities.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
in
part
that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
i
think
not
solely.
not
solely.
i
think
there
are
also
issues
going
to
the
nature
of
the
misrepresentation
involved,
and
the
first--
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
what
i
am
suggesting
to
your
honor
is
that
the
oral
expression
which
passes
or
is
asserted
to
be
a
security
in
this
case
should
not
be
accepted
as
such,
that
in
this
case
that
what
you're
basically
dealing
with
is
a
conversation
which
gave
rise
to
an
asserted
right
to
purchase
common
stock
in
a
subsidiary.
the
answer
to
why,
as
i
understand
the
law,
your
honor,
is
rooted
in
the
blue
chip
stamps
case.
and
as
i
interpret
that
case,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
to
reflect
a
reluctance
on
the
part
of
the
court
to
accept
oral
assertions
as
satisfying
the
predicate
to
establish
standing
to
sue
as
a
purchaser
of
securities.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
well,
certainly
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
then
oral
statement
cannot
constitute
a
misrepresentation.
far
be
it
from
me
to
suggest
that.
going
to
the
second
part
of
your
question,
your
honor,
i
certainly
think
that
distinctions
can
be
made
between
the
breadth
of
section
10(b)
in
the
hands
of
the
sec
and
the
breadth
of
the
judicially
implied
private
right
of
action
under
section
10(b).
and
as
your
honor
is
aware,
there
are
distinctions.
in
an
sec
action,
it
is
of
no
concern
whether
anyone
relied
on
misrepresentation.
in
fact,
there
is
no
purchaser
requirement
constraining
the
sec's
enforcement
bar.
so
i
think
the
contours
of
the
private
right
of
action
which
is
implied
under
section
10(b)
are
quite
different
from
the
contours
within
which
the
sec
might
bring
an
enforcement
action.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
your
honor,
i
think
as
a
matter
of
federal
securities
law,
as
i
read
the
blue
chips
stamps
case,
that
a
conversation
which
a
person
asserts
via
an
oral
option
should
not,
under
the
doctrine
of
that
case,
be
accepted
as
a
security.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
there
is
no
question
about
that.
the
holding
of
the
case
itself
was
limited
to
a
situation
in
which
the
offerees
in
that
situation
did
not
purchase
the
stock.
but
what
i
say
to
your
honor
is
i
don't
think
given
what
i
understand
to
be...
and
of
course
your
honor
would
know
better
than
i...
the
thrust
of
that
opinion.
the
reluctance
of
the
court
to
accept
wholly
oral
testimony
not
for
the
purpose
of
saying
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
misrepresentation,
but
for
the
purpose
of
satisfying
the
threshold
predicate
requirement
of
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff
has
purchased
securities.
the
court,
time
and
again
in
the
course
of
that
opinion,
said
that
the
principal
advantage
of
that
doctrine
was
to
place
as
a
requirement
for
standing
in
a
10(b)
case
a
transaction
which
could
be
proven
by
document.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
your
honor
is
correct
in
saying
that
there's
no
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
purchase
of
an
option
here
in
a
contractually
binding
sense,
because
as
your
honor
is
aware,
it
certainly
is
our
position
that
the
court,
the
district
court,
failed
to
properly
instruct
the
jury
with
respect
to
the
statute
of
fraud.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
i
don't
think
it's
simpler,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
in
which
blue
chip
stamps
saw
a
difficulty,
if
i
could
explain.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
it's
not
simpler
for
the
following
reasons,
what
was
the
core,
as
i
understand
it,
of
blue
chips
stamps'
concern
was
that
you'll
get
someone
who
attempts
to
establish
standing
to
bring
a
section
10(b)
action
based
on
an
oral
assertion
of
what
it
is
they
would
have
done.
now
i
submit
to
your
honor,
that
this
case
is
no
different
in
that
respect.
the
oral
option...
the
purchase
of
the
oral
option...
all
of
that
is
a
lawyer's
description
of
what
happened
in
a
conversation.
and
just
as
in--
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
--i
think
it
is,
if
i
may.
i
think
this
is
a
would
have,
could
have,
should
have
case.
no
question
about
it.
don't
forget
that
in
the
blue
chips
stamps
case,
you
weren't
talking
about
a
drive
by
offeree
in
the
market
place.
what
you
were
talking
about
in
blue
chip
stamps
were
a
group
of
retailers
who
as
a
result
of
a
plan
of
reorganization
that
was
entered
after
a
consent
decree
had
the
right
to
purchase
a
determinate
number
of
shares
which
was
defined
in
the
consent
decree.
therefore,
their
right
to
make
the
purchase
was
clearly
documented.
in
addition,
in
terms
of
the
damage
claim
in
that
action,
in
terms
of
the
injury,
they
were
pointing
to
the
difference
between
what
the
price
the
stock
was
trading
at
currently
and
the
price
which
it
was
offered
at
in
the
prospectus.
and
they
said
that
is
the
measure
of
my
damages.
here,
you're
dealing
with
i
think
very
much
a
weaker
case
in
the
sense
that
the
alleged
act
of
purchase,
the
existence
of
the
option,
was
throughout
a
lawyer's
description
of
an
oral
event.
and
the
would
have,
could
have,
should
have
goes
like
this,
i
would
have
exercised
my
option;
i
would
over
a
period
of
years
have
invested
fifty
million
dollars
in
this
business;
the
business
would
have
succeeded,
and
the
stock
market
would
have
valued
my
stock
interest
at
x
million
dollars.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
well,
i
think
where
the
subjunctive
gets
in...
and
perhaps
it's
not
a
subjunctive
as
such...
what
i'm
saying
to
you
is
that
the
nature
of
the
jury's
conclusion
in
this
particular
case,
i
think,
should
not
be
relevant
to
the
determination
which
the
court
is
making,
if
my
construction
of
the
blue
chip
stamps
case
is
accurate.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
no
it's
not...
i'm
not
saying...
i
think
it's
a
would
have,
should
have
case
in
many
regards,
your
honor,
in
many
regards.
but
what
i'm
saying
with
respect
to
the
reason
why
blue
chip
stamps
should
be
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case
is
that
i
don't
see
any
difference
in
the
quality
of
the
oral
evidence,
or
the
oral
event
which
gave
rise
to
the
finding,
and
the
quality
of
the
oral
evidence
which
drove
the
court
in
blue
chip
stamps
to
say
no,
i'm
not
going
to
extend
the
doctrine
to
that
situation.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
that's
what
i
am
saying.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
that's
right.
i'm
not
saying
that
oral
representation
cannot
be
fraudulent.
what
i
am
saying
is
where
a
plaintiff
cannot
satisfy
the
threshold
requirement
of
purchase
of
a
security
except
by
a
purely
oral
event,
then
i
would--
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
--well,
your
honor,
as
to
that
i
would
suggest
that
if
you
look
at
section
3810
that
all
of
the
elements
of
a
security
there
as
defined
are
elements
which
are
ordinarily
written
instruments...
common
stock,
bonds,
notes.
there
is
nothing
i
think,
your
honor,
in
3810...
no
one
of
the
individual
elements...
which
is
not
a
written
document
and
therefore--
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
--i'm
not
saying
that
that...
i
can't
tell
you
what
element
alone
would
have
sufficed
for
the
conclusion.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
no,
i
don't.
i
don't
think
it
would
have.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
well,
that
is
certainly
true.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
well,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
blue
chip
stamps
opinion
governs
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
i
would
point
out
to
your
honor
is
that
two
circuit
courts
have
interpreted
blue
chip
stamps
to
bar
standing
to
a
plaintiff
who
sought
to
assert...
satisfied
the
purchase
requirement
and
sought
to
assert
standing
on
the
basis
of
an
oral
agreement
to
purchase
securities.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
in
the
kagen
case...
the
kagen
case--
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
--in
the
seventh
circuit,
and
the
pelletier
case
in
the
eleventh
circuit
both
held
that,
and
those
are,
to
my
understanding,
the
only
reasoned
interpretations
of
blue
chip
stamps
since
that
case
was
decided
with
respect
to
this
particular
issue.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
a
couple
of
things
about
that.
first
of
all,
certainly
the
courts
of
appeal
have
construed
blue
chip
stamps
to
hold
that
if
you
had
a
purely
oral
event
to
satisfy
the
purchase
requirement
which
is
unenforceable
under
the
statute
of
frauds,
that
under
blue
chips
stamps
that
didn't
suffice,
number
one.
number
two,
the
argument
i
was
making
about
blue
chip
stamps
and
the
significance
of
oral
evidence
is
not
limited
to
the
statute
of
frauds.
after
all,
you're
talking
about
the
meaning
of
the
federal
statute,
and
my
interpretation
of
justice
rehnquist's
opinion
in
blue
chip
stamps...
excuse
me,
the
court's
opinion
in
blue
chip
stamps
as
underlying
the
kagen
and
pelletier
decisions
is
that
where
the
quality
of
the
satisfaction
of
the
purchase
is
oral,
the
quality
of
the
evidence
is
purely
oral,
that
the
claim
is
too
dubious
in
its
nature
to
satisfy
that
threshold
requirement--
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
--no,
i'm
not
saying
that.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
no,
no,
no.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
no,
what
i
was
saying
was
that
where
for
purposes
of
construing
the
federal
statute,
irrespective
of
the
statute
of
fraud,
that
the
rule
is
a
federal
rule,
and
the
rule
should
be
that
where
the
event
which
is
said
to
satisfy
the
purchase
of
a
security
requirement
is
wholly
oral,
that
that
should
be
insufficient
for
very
much
the
same
reasons
as
the
underlay
of
the
blue
chip
stamps
requirement.
now,
with
respect
to--
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
well,
let
me
speak
to
that
if
i
may,
and
also
it
comes
back
to
the
second
part
of
justice
souter's
question.
and
this
has
to
do
with
the
significance
of
the
statute
of
frauds
in
this
case.
and
the
proposition
which
i'm
going
to
advance,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
the
errors
committed
by
the
district
court
and
by
the
eleventh
circuit
with
respect
to
the
statute
of
frauds
are
clear
and
undeniable
and
are
fatal
to
every
cause
of
action
which
was
asserted
in
this
case,
state
or
federal.
now,
grant
me
the
indulgence
of
assuming,
although
i've
had
little
indication
of
this,
that
the
kagen
and
pelletier
approach
would
prevail,
and
that
the
court
was
at
least
open
to
the
argument
that,
well,
blue
chip
stamps
means
that
if
you
have
an
oral
event
upon
which
you
are
basing
your
purchase
argument,
and
you
don't
have
an
enforceable
contract
under
the
statute
of
frauds,
you
don't
have
a
purchase.
now,
i
think...
and
i
don't
mean
to
be
rude
or
over
reaching...
but
i
think
it's
clear
that
both
the
district
court
and
the
eleventh
circuit
committed
undeniable
errors
in
the
way
they
treated
the
statute
of
frauds
question.
in
the
court
of
appeals
they
said
that
the
statute
of
frauds
did
not
apply
to
this
case
because
the
oral
option,
although
a
security
for
securities
act
purposes
was
not
a
security
for
the
purpose
of
the
statute
of
frauds.
now,
bear
in
mind
that
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
an
oral
agreement
contract
option
for
the
sale
of
securities.
and
i
submit
that
there
can't
be
any
question
that
the
proper
analysis
on
these
facts
is
that
the
oral
option
was
the
contract
for
the
sale
of
securities
which
the
statute
of
frauds
rendered
unenforceable.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
well,
your
honor,
if
i
understand
where
we're
at
at
this
point,
and
that
is,
what
is
the...
what
should
be
the
consequence
of
a
decision
in
this
case?
that
there
was
no
section
10(b)
violation
because
of
the
existence
of
the
state
claim.
if
i
can
address
that
question
briefly.
my
position
on
that
question
is
that
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
decided
case
authorities
since
santa
fe
and
blue
chip
stamps,
there
are
two
lines
of
authority
which
unanimously
would
have
resulted
in
the
dismissal
of
these
claims.
now,
we've
been
talking
about
one
of
those
lines,
and
that
is
to
say
whether
or
not
you
can
create
a
purchase
out
of
an
oral
event.
there
is
another
line
of
cases
which
doesn't
deal
with
the
purchase
question.
another
line
of
cases
which
says
that
where
you
have
a
misrepresentation
of
a
party's
intention
to
sell
securities,
as
distinguished
in
the
language
of
the
courts,
from
a
misrepresentation
going
to
the
value
of
the
securities,
you
don't
have
a
section
10(b)
violation.
there
are
four
circuit
courts
that
have
come
to
that
conclusion;
there
are
two
district
court
cases
within
the
last
three
years
that
have
followed
those
cases.
just
this
year--
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
--yes,
indeed,
and
that
made
it
all
the
way
into
the
restatement,
did
it
not?
did
it
not?
but
what
i
say
to
you
is
this,
and
it's
not
a
simple
thought
to
get
across,
but
to
the
extent
we're
talking
about
whether
or
not
that
type
of
statement
which
has
been
made
in
this
case
is
actionable,
that
we've
gone
a
long
way
beyond
the
state
of
the
digestion,
and
where
we
have
gotten
to
in
the
united
states,
generally
speaking,
is
to
the
economic
loss
doctrine,
which
is
squarely
applicable
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
i
think
it's
also,
your
honor,
a
doctrine
which
this
court
should
take
into
account
in
deciding
what
types
of
misrepresentation
are
actionable
under
section
10(b).
the
proposition
is--
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
--your
honor--
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
--your
honor,
i
think
whether
or
not
you
recognize
the
distinction
here
depends
on
how
you
characterize
the
purpose
of
the
securities
act...
if
we're
talking
about
a
10(b)(5)
case,
which
is
what
we're
talking
about.
and
what
i
mean
to
say
by
that
is
there
are
lots
of
actions
which
can
undermine
the
value
of
a
security
or
an
option
to
purchase
a
security.
but
i
submit
that
there
is
a
very
clear
distinction
between
a
misrepresentation
about
the
financial
condition
of
a
company
and
the
refusal
to
accede
to
an
asserted
contractual
obligation
to
delivery
securities,
and
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
given
the
way
in
which
this
court
has
articulated
the
purpose
of
the
'34
act
that
a
line
should
be
drawn
between
those
representations
which
in
the
garden
variety
section
10(b)(5)
case
speak
to
the
value
of
a
security
in
a
situation
such
as
this
in
which
a
person
says
he
should
have
sold
me
the
stock
and
he
didn't,
and
he
lied
about
it
in
the
first
place.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
i
keep
trying
to
get
there,
but
i
get
diverted.
and
the
reason
is
this,
and
this
is
the
reason
that
i
was
speaking
to
the
other
reason
why
you
shouldn't
find
a
section
10(b)
violation
here,
which
is
in
terms
of
the
character
of
the
representation
which
has
been
made
here,
and
the
limited
purpose
of
the
'34
act.
and
i
was
about
to
get
to
that
point
when
i
said
there
are
four
circuit
courts
who
have
decided
uniformly,
consistently,
that
the
'34
act
does
not
apply
to
an
alleged
misrepresentation
of
a
party's
intention
to
sell
securities.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
i'm
about
there...
i'm
about
there.
[laughter]
and
the
answer
is...
the
answer
is
that
is
the
kind
of
decision
which
can
be
made
in
a
rule
12
case.
now
i
understand
your
honor's
formulation
of
well,
if
they've
got
jurisdiction
and
there
is
a
decision,
what
is
all
this
about?
what
i'm
saying
to
you
is
this.
there
is
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
with
a
standard
which
says
whether
or
not
the
court
should
proceed
to
adjudicate
the
state
law
claims
depends
on
the
degree
of
frivolity
of
the
federal
action.
i
say
to
you
that
those
courts...
those
circuit
courts...
which
have
decided
that
if
you
have
a
case
which
is
dismissable
under
rule
12,
then
you
shouldn't
go
forward
and
adjudicate
the
state
claims
is
squarely
applicable
here.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
well,
i
say
that
that
factor
is
not
worth
consideration
which
your
honor
is
according
to
it
for
the
following
reason.
number
one,
there
is
a
value
in
having
important,
unsettled
questions
of
state
law
decided
by
state
courts,
and
that
is
why
the
courts
have
been
restricted
from
asserting
jurisdiction
over
the
state
claim
when
they
have
dismissed
the
federal
claim
prior
to
the
trial.
now,
i
say
that
if
you
accept
my
construction
of
section
10(b),
if
you
accept
my
construction
of
blue
chip
stamps
as
six
circuit
courts
have
done,
the
answer
is
when
that
case
came
up
on
a
rule
12
motion,
judge
king
should
have
thrown
it
out.
now,
he
should
not
have
gone
forward
at
that
point
to
have
adjudicated
the
state
cause
of
actions,
and
i
say
to
you--
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
--that's
correct.
abuse
of
discretion,
because
had
he
made
the
right
decision
assuming,
granting
me
the
assumption,
that
there
is
no
10(b)(5)
action
here,
he
should
have
thrown
the
case
out
at
that
point.
now
you
have
to
ask
yourself,
well,
does
it
make
a
difference
that
we
have
had
some
investment
of
time
as
a
result
of
a
judicial
mistake?
and,
again,
a
couple
of
circuits
have
said
no,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
because
there
are
values
in
restraining
the
federal
judiciary
from
deciding
state
court
issues
in
those
circumstances
which
are
not
excused
by
the
fact
that
someone
made
a
mistake
at
the
district
court
level
and
we
should
therefore
vacate
that
decision.
that's
what
happened
in
tully
v.
mott
supermarkets,
for
example.
now,
i
say
to
you
also--
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
--that
is
true
but
for
one
other
consideration,
your
honor,
and
that's
this.
i
say
to
you
that
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
district
court
were
unquestionably
wrong
in
the
way
they
decided
the
statute
of
frauds
question,
and
in
the
way
they
decided
the
economic
loss
doctrine
question.
a
proper
decision
on
either
one
of
those
theories
would
have
thrown
out
every
cause
of
action
in
this
case,
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
where
you're
in
a
situation
where
there
is
in
fact
at
the
end
of
the
day
no
federal
question,
and
you
present
it
with
a--
