justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you've
raised...
it
seems
to
me
in
your
last
point
you've
raised
two
points.
one
is
a
valuation
point,
which
i
don't
think
is
directly
what
justice
scalia
is
concerned
with.
the
other,
the
would
have,
should
have
point
is
i
would
have
exercised
my
option.
but
as
i
understand
it,
it's
not
open
to
us
to
assume
that
that
is
the
case.
as
i
understand
it,
the
finding
was
that
they
did
exercise
the
option.
that
they
exercised
the
option
by
going
ahead
in
effect
and
paying
part
of
the
consideration
for
that...
for
getting
the
option
which
was
the
help
that
they
gave
to
your
client
in
getting
the
license.
so
that
as
i
understand
it,
we
have
a
finding
that
this
is
not
a
hypothetical
should
have
or
would
have
case,
but
a
case
in
which
we
did.
we
went
ahead,
and
when
we
performed...
when
we
did
the
part
performance,
at
least...
that
sealed
the
deal
for
the
option.
we
had
the
option,
and
there
is
no
question
as
i
understand
it
that
they
sought
to
exercise
the
option
at
a
later
time.
so
i
don't
see
where
the
subjunctive
gets
into
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
your
construction...
i
thought
your
construction
is
that
yes,
blue
chip
stamps,
as
justice
scalia
put
it,
is
a
would
have,
should
have
case,
and
this
is
a
would
have,
should
have
case.
and
i
don't
think
this
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
i
think
you
in
essence
are
saying
that
they
cannot
be
the
oral
creation
of
the
security
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that
is
true,
then
you
have
to
admit
that
blue
chip
doesn't
stand
for
the
proposition
that
you
can't
have
an
orally
created
security,
and
that
we
are,
as
justice
scalia
started
out
by
saying,
going
to
have
to
go
beyond
blue
chip
to
hold
your
way
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
why--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
you're
in
effect
saying
that
the
'34
act
should
be
construed
as,
in
effect,
incorporating
the
statute
of
frauds
for
purposes
of
determining
how
a
security,
or
what
can
qualify
as
a
security
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
my
question
is,
why
should
we
interpret
it
when
the
statute
of
frauds
has
traditionally
had
an
independent
life
of
its
own,
and
of
course
incidentally
in
this
case,
the
statute
of
frauds
has
either
been
satisfied
by
part
performance,
or
has
been
satisfied
by
part
performance
as
i
understand
it
in
the
findings
of
the
jury.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
there
could
be
an
oral
contract,
and
there
could
be
the
oral
creation
of
a
security,
but
that
the
act
of
exercise
cannot
be
oral.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
that's
what
you
just
said.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
sorry.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
cohen,
i
just
want
to
go
back
to
justice
breyer's
question--
justice
david
h.
souter
--tell
me
if
i'm
wrong
here.
i
think
we've
got
to
say
something
definite
about
what
the
statute
of
fraud
rule
is
that
will
underlie
our
case,
even
if
you
are
right
on
part
performance,
and
i
will
assume
you
are,
because
we
could
construe
the
statute
either
to
say
there
is
no
requirement
of
writing
in
the
statute.
in
other
words,
it
has
no
built
in
statute
of
frauds.
or
we
could
say
there
is
some
kind
of
a
built
in
statute
of
frauds,
but
it
is
satisfied
by
part
performance.
or
we
could
say
possibly...
i
don't
know
whether
we
should...
but
we
could
say
the
federal
statute
in
effect
simply
leaves
the
problem
of
writing
to
state
law.
if
state
law
would
in
fact
recognize
the
contract
under
its
statute
of
frauds,
then
that
contract
is
sufficient
to
create
a
security,
or
whatnot,
for
the
purposes
of
the
securities
act.
i
think
we've
got
to
say
one
of
those
three
things.
which
should
we
say?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
then
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
creation
of
the
security
in
the
case
of
the
creation
of
the
option...
that
too...
i
mean,
that's
essentially
a
contractual
act,
and
that
too
is
a
question
to
be
governed
by
the
state
statute
of
frauds.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
agree
that
the
statute,
in
effect,
looks
to
state
law
on
the
question
of
statute
of
frauds
issues?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
there
is
either
a
standard
implied
in
the
statute
itself,
or
there
is
no...
a
requirement
implied
in
the
statute
itself,
or
there
is
no
requirement,
period.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
that
leaves
open
the
question
of
what
a
contract
is.
and
don't
we
look
to
state
law
to
determine
what
that
contract
is?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
would
open
the
doors
of
the
securities
act,
presumably,
to
claims
that
state
law
would
not
recognize
and
that
in
itself
might
be
a
good
reason,
if
we
knew
nothing
else,
to
say
that
the
question
of
contractual
formation
is
a
state
law
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
we
may...
we
may
get
very
close
to
it
if
we
have
to
address
what
the
source
of
any
writing
requirement
or
the
dispensation
of
any
writing
requirement
is.
and
if
we
look
to
state
law
on
that,
presumably
it
would
be
odd
if
we
didn't
look
to
state
law
as
well
for
what
a
contract
is.
