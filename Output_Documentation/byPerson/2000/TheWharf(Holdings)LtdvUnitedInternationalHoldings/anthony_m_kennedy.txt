justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
one
question.
justice
souter
asked
counsel
for
petitioner
whether
or
not
the
option
was
not
exercised
when
these
additional
services
were
performed,
i
take
it
after
october
8,
1992.
i
thought--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
i
thought
there
was
some
agreement
from
petitioner's
counsel
that
that
was
in
fact
the
theory
of
the
case.
of
course,
he
says
there's
no
option
at
all.
when
was
this
option
exercised?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
was
it
exercised
in
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay,
so
the
option
was--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
the
option
was
not
exercised
in
your
view
immediately
after
october
8
when
the
additional
services
were
performed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
could
have
been
sued
if
you
didn't
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
it
is
important,
and
you
agree
with
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
that
this
was
a
bilateral
contract
in
which
they
could
have
been
sued
if
they
did
not
provide
the
necessary
services,
and
those
services
were
sufficiently
specific
to
have
a
contract
that
was
not
illusory
in
the
trial
courts,
and
the
jury
so
found?
