justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
unlike
those
typical
securities
situations,
what
worries
me
about
this
case
is
the
pizza
man
says,
smith,
my
customer
told
me
over
the
phone
that
if
i
got
the
pizza
there
on
time
he'd
give
me
fifty
shares
of
his
stock.
do
we
have
a
securities
fraud?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
in
my
example.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
my
example.
in
my
example
the
pizza
man
calls
up...
pizza
man,
i
called
him
yesterday,
and
he
said
if
i
got
the
pizza
there
in
fifteen
minutes
he
would
sell
me
fifty
shares
of
his
stock
for
forty
dollars.
is
that
a
securities
fraud?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
you'd
say
no
to
that
one.
i
was
about
to
tell
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you're
saying
then
that
any
kind...
any
time
a
person
claims
that
somebody
sold
them
a
share
of
stock,
or
promised
to
sell
them
a
share
of
stock
orally,
that
becomes
a
federal
securities
case.
i
didn't
think
you
were
going
to
say
that,
but
if
you
are,
i'm
quite
interested.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we're
saying
the
same
thing,
and
i
guess
the
argument
against
that
would
be
that
the
securities
statute
doesn't
intend
to
have
every
oral
contract
for
selling
some
stock
to
become
a
securities
fraud
case.
there
was
no
intention
to
have
that
done,
there
is
no
reason
to
have
it
done.
it's
perhaps
a
contract
action.
most
states
wouldn't
permit
it
because
it
would
be
oral,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
know,
but
i'm
trying
to
get
at
the
policy
that
would
underlie
my
concession
exactly
right.
the
pizza
man
says
i
have
a
completed
executory
contract
to
sell
me
an
option
in
return
for
my
getting
the
pizza
there
on
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
has
promised
to
sell
me
fifty
shares
of
stock.
now,
that's
an
option.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
missing
my
question,
and
i
won't
pursue
it
except
to
add
what
i
thought
you'd
answer.
i
thought
you'd
answer
my
question
no,
because
there's
no
fraud
there.
and
then
i
was
about
to
say,
but
all
you
have
to
do
is
add
the
allegation.
and
at
the
time
he
intended
not
to
carry
it
out.
and
that
allegation
always
can
be
added,
for
after
all
he
is
defending
the
case,
isn't
he?
and
if
he's
defending
the
case,
that's
pretty
good
evidence
that
he
intended
not
to
carry
it
out,
and
therefore
you've
made
all,
or
almost
all,
oral
promises
into
securities
cases,
contrary
to
the
intent
of
the
statute.
now,
i
was
trying
to
get
you
to
address
the
policies
that
might
refute
my
hypothetical,
but
maybe
it's
too
complex,
and
maybe
you
can't
do
that
easily.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
win...
this
is
just
what's
worrying
me.
imagine
every
state
says
sales
of
goods
or
services
over
ten
million
dollars
has
to
be
in
writing.
all
right?
now,
to
a
person
who's...
that
would
make
no
difference.
that
statement
i
just
made
would
be,
as
a
practical
matter,
irrelevant
because
anybody
in
the
stock
area,
because
anybody
who
wanted
to
allege
an
oral
contract
to
sell
ten
million
dollars'
worth
of
stock
would
run
right
into
federal
court
and
say
it's
a
securities
claim.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
what
he
says
is
he
promised
to
sell
me
some
stock.
the
promise
is
an
option
on
your
view,
and
therefore
it
is
a
security.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
promise.
i'm
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sorry.
in
return
for
my
services,
he
promised
that
he
would
sell
me
some
stock.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
all
those
cases
which
would
be
outlawed
by
the
state
statute
of
frauds,
i've
imagined,
would
suddenly
come
into
federal
court
as
securities
claims.
it's
the
same
problem
i
have.
what's
bothering
me
is
the
sweep
of
a
decision
in
your
favor,
and
that's
what
i
want
you
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
was
exactly
why
i
asked.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
why
i
asked...
it
seems
like
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world,
look,
this
will
come
up
in
families.
no
brokers,
no
securities,
uncle
joe
promised
to
lend
me...
to
give
me
securities
if
i
would
take
care
of
him
for
a
year
or
two,
which
i
did.
okay,
we've
got
your
option.
and
you
say,
oh,
well,
but
what
about
the
misrepresentation?
well,
if
uncle
joe
is
alive.
look...
he's
defending
the
case,
isn't
he?
and
therefore
if
you
believe
that
he
made
the
oral
statement,
why
didn't
he
carry
it
out?
so
he's
here
defending
it,
so
he
must
have
intended
not
to
carry
it
out.
now,
maybe
that
isn't
totally
sufficient,
but
you'd
be
well
along
the
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
is
here...
he
is
here
defending
the
case
which
proves
he
never
intended
from
day
one
to
follow
his
oral
thing
and,
besides,
i
remember
his
saying
that
once.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
the
second
case
is
called
wharf
holdings
v.
united
international
holdings,
and
it
is
a
federal
security’s
case.
now,
as
many
know,
the
federal
securities
act,
as
it
has
been
elaborated
by
rule
10b-5,
forbids
the
use
of
any
deceptive
device,
any
fraud
or
deceit
which
includes
the
making
of
any
materially
untrue
statement
or
fact,
and
it
includes
the
omission
of
such
a
fact
“in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
any
security”.
now,
in
this
case
we
have
to
take
as
given
the
following
facts
so
they
were
much
disputed
below
but
we
must
take
them
as
given.
wharf,
which
is
a
hong
kong
company,
obtained
the
help
of
united,
which
is
a
colorado
company
in
helping
wharf
prepare
a
bid
for
an
exclusive
hong
kong
cable
television
franchise.
in
return,
wharf,
orally
granted
united
an
option
to
buy
10%
of
the
resulting
cable
system
shares
if
wharf
proves
successful,
which
wharf
did
prove.
but,
at
the
same
time
that
wharf
was
saying
this,
wharf’s
chairman
was
simultaneously
and
secretly
writing
other
things
for
example
no,
no,
no,
we
don’t
accept
that,
referring
to
the
option.
a
fact
that,
along
with
other
evidence
convinced
the
jury
that
wharf
had
a
secret
reservation.
it
secretly
intended
not
to
live
up
to
its
word.
wharf
has
here
tried
to
convince
us,
as
it
tried
to
convince
the
court
of
appeals
that
circumstances
of
this
kind
fall
outside,
not
inside
the
scope
of
the
securities
act,
but
like
the
court
of
appeals,
we
conclude
that
wharf
is
wrong.
we
think
the
securities
act
does
cover
this
kind
of
case.
on
its
face
the
act’s
term
seems
satisfied.
wharf
would
seem
to
have
sold
the
security,
namely
the
option
to
united
in
return
for
united
services.
wharf
would
seem
to
have
made
a
false
material
statement
of
fact
or
more
accurately,
a
material
omission,
in
failing
to
tell
united
about
its
secret
reservation
not
to
follow
through
on
its
premises
and
the
omission
would
seem
to
have
taken
place
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
the
security,
namely
the
option.
wharf,
however,
makes
three
basic
claims
to
the
contrary:
first
it
points
out
that
its
promise
to
grant
the
option
was
oral
and
it
argues
that
this
court’s
blue
chip
stamps
case
in
effect
takes
oral
promises
outside
the
act’s
scope.
well,
we
disagree
with
that
interpretation
of
the
case
and
we
note
that
states
recognize
in
their
statute
of
frauds'
oral
contracts
to
buy
securities
and
we
hold
the
oral
nature
does
not
make
a
difference.
second,
it
argues,
the
act
does
not
cover
the
kind
of
material
misrepresentation
or
omission
here
at
issue.
a
failure
to
disclose
the
secret
reservation,
not
to
perform,
because
wharf
says
that
misrepresentation
did
not
relate
to
the
value
of
the
security.
well,
assuming
that
it
has
to
it
does.
but
we
think
if
you
have
the
secret
reservation,
not
to
follow
through
that
makes
the
option
makes
the
option
worth
a
lot
less.
third,
wharf
argues
that
this
kind
of
failure
to
disclose
should
not
count
as
a
misrepresentation
within
the
acts
term
because
it
will
be
too
easy
to
sweep
within
federal
securities
law,
ordinary
state
law
breach-of-contract
claims,
just
failure
to
live
up
to
a
promise
to
sell
by
recharacterizing
them
as
secret
reservation
cases,
so,
you
didn’t
intend
to
sell
all
the
time.
here,
however
united
proved
that
its
case
was
not
a
simple
breach-of-contract
case.
it
showed
the
secret
reservations
with
documentary
evidence
and
the
practical
problems
that
wharf
points
to
just
happen
to
risen
in
circuits
that
have
permitted
secret
reservation
cases.
for
these
and
related
reasons,
we
reject
wharf’s
argument.
we
affirm
the
court
of
the
appeals
determination
in
favor
of
united.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
