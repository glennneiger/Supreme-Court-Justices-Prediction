justice
ruth
bader

mr.
dodyk,
how
far
do
you
take
that?
are
you
saying
that
no
oral
representations
count
under
the
exchange
act?
are
you
saying
that
that
goes
for
the
sec
as
well
as
what
we
have
here,
private
suitor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying,
mr.
dodyk,
that
there
can't
be
any
oral
options
as
a
matter
of
federal
securities
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
a
statute
that
lists
a
whole
bunch
of
things
that
constitute
a
security;
one
of
them
is
an
option.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
in
writing
in
the
text
of
the
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dodyk,
may
i
ask?
there
is
an
aspect
of
this
case
that
is
very
disturbing
to
me,
and
i
want
you
to
get
to
it
before
your
time
runs
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
a
case
with
one
federal
claim.
i
think
there
were
ten
or
eleven
state
claims.
it
was
thoroughly
tried.
there
were
determinations
of
those
state
claims.
the
damages,
as
i
understand
them,
would
have
been
the
same
if
you
never
had
10(b)
in
the
picture.
and
at
this
stage,
at
least
going
in,
i
mean,
you're
urging
that
the
court
hold
something
today
that
it
has
never
held
before.
there
is
an
arguable
question
of
the
interpretation
of
federal
law.
the
state
claims
were
pended
to
that
and
thoroughly
tried.
this
is
not
a
case
that
was
dismissed
at
the
threshold.
why
are
we...
it
seems
to
me
that
we're
talking
about
something
that
is
academic
in
this
case
if
a
judgment
is
going
to
stand
based
on
the
adjudication
of
the
state
claims.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
one
might
say,
if
we
accepted
everything
you
said,
that
the
federal
claim
would
fail
on
a
12(b)(6).
but
there
was
federal
question
jurisdiction
by
virtue
of
a
claim...
of
an
arguable
claim.
and
there
was
indeed
a
trial.
and
i
just
don't
understand
why,
even
if
i
accepted
what
you
just
said,
that
touches
the
fact
that
there
was
federal
question
jurisdiction,
that
everything
that
you're
talking
about
would
go
to,
has
there
been
a
claim
for
relief
stated?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dodyk,
you
still
haven't
gotten
to
why,
even
if
we
accept
what
you
said,
there
should
be
any
redoing
of
this
case
when
the
state
claims
were
tried,
and
the
same
damages
would
apply
to
those.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
question
is,
we're
not
in
the
posture
of
should
you
go
forward?
they
have
gone
forward,
and
what
you're
saying
is
that
we
should
upset
this
entire
adjudication.
if
we
were
back
in
the
beginning
and
the
question
was
should
the
federal
court
go
forward
on
the
state
claims
once
the
federal
claim
is
out
of
the
picture,
one
gets
one
answer.
but
we're
at
the
end
of
the
line,
and
these
cases
have,
in
fact,
been
tried.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
is
a
matter
of
lack
of
jurisdiction,
but
abuse
of
discretion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
would
not
reach
that
judgment
if
we
thought
that
the
case
for
the
federal
claim
was
a
lot
more
solid
than
you
suggest,
even
if
you
would
ultimately
win
on
it,
that
this
was
not
frivolous
by
any
means.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
extinguish
between
a
garden
variety
breach
of
contract
where
somebody
doesn't
perform
and
one
where
from
day
one
there
was
no
intent
to
perform?
