justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
what
you
consider
the
security
to
be
in
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
first
about
what
the
security
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
the
respondents
say,
and
what
the
court
below
believed
is
that
the
security
here
was
an
option.
and
the
definition
of
security
in
the
act
includes
an
option
to
purchase
securities.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
isn't
the
issue
here...
whether
the
plaintiff
purchased
or
not.
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
security
existed.
whether
there
was,
indeed,
an
option,
or
there
wasn't
an
option.
if
there
was
an
option,
there's
no
doubt
that
this
plaintiff
purchased
it.
it
isn't
a
question
of
whether
the
plaintiff,
you
know,
agreed
to
accept
the
option
or
not.
that's,
as
i
understand
it,
not
an
issue.
the
question
is
was
there
an
option.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
quite
a
different
question
in
blue
chip.
the
question
in
blue
chip
is
whether
the
plaintiff
would
have
bought
the
stock
or
not.
you
have
no
idea
whether
the
plaintiff
would
have
bought
this
stock.
plaintiff
said
i
would
have
but
for
this
misrepresentation,
or
i
would
have
sold
it
but
for
the
misrepresentation.
it's
totally
up
in
the
air.
the
question
here
is
much
simpler,
much
more
focused.
was
there
a
promise
by
the
alleged
seller
of
the
option
to
deliver
the
stock
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
description
of
would
have,
could
have,
should
have.
i
mean,
and
that's
what
was
at
issue
in
blue
chip.
oh,
had
i
known
this,
i
would
have.
had
i
not
known
it,
i
would
not
have.
and
it's
all
speculation
about
the
future.
there's
no
speculation
about
the
future
here.
it
is
a
simple
past
fact.
was
there
this
promise
to
deliver
the
stock
in
exchange
for
certain
actions
by
the
other
side,
or
was
there
not?
that's
not
at
all
as
hard
to
prove
as
the
would
have,
could
have,
should
have
stuff
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that
blue
chip
would
have
come
out
differently
if
there
were
a
writing
from
the
president
of
the
purchaser
to
his
mother
saying
we
intend
to
purchase
this
stock
of
this
corporation
next
week.
do
you
really
think
that
the
only
problem
in
blue
chip
was
the
lack
of
a
writing,
or
was
it
the
inherent
difficulty
of
showing
what
somebody
would
have
done
when
it
has
not,
in
fact,
been
done.
whereas
the
claim
here
is
that
something
has
been
done;
not
that
it
would
have
been
done,
but
that
it
has
been.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
a
letter
might
have
done
the
job,
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
think
it
would
have,
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
giving
you
the
point
that
the
only
kind
of
misrepresentation
that
counts
under
10(b)
is
a
misrepresentation
of
value,
do
you
really
think
that
an
option
to
purchase
from
someone
who,
when
he
gives
you
the
option,
has
no
intention
of
ever
selling
you
what
he
has
promised
to
sell
you?
is
it
worth
as
much
as
an
option
from
someone
who
when
he
gives
you
the
option
intends
to
go
through
with
the
delivery
of
stock
if
you
exercise
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
that...
i
can't
imagine
what
would
more
go
to
the
value
of
the
option
than
the
intent
of
the
optionor
to
follow
through
on
the
contract
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you,
mr.
dodyk.
mr.
cohen,
we'll
hear
from
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cohen,
i
must
say
i
just
marvel
at
the
bon
homme
or
the
old
fashioned
nature
of
your
client
to
gamble
all
of
this
money
on
an
oral
handshake
deal.
do
people
still
do
that
out
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
how
much
money
was
involved
in
this
deal?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
i
wouldn't
even
buy
an
automobile
without
a
written
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
that
we
ought
to
protect
this
kind
of
recklessness.
if
you
want
to
rely
on
a
handshake
deal,
then
you
better
be
sure
you're
shaking
the
hand
of
somebody
who
can
be
trusted.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have
over
a
million
lawyers
in
this
country,
and
one
of
the
main
things
they
do
is
to
make
sure
that
people
make
things
easy
by
putting
it
in
writing.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
went
ahead
before
the
documentation
was
prepared.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i'm
making
a
serious
point
here,
i'm
just
not
saying
your
client
was
foolish.
i'm
questioning
whether
we
ought
to
protect
foolish
people
like
that...
whether
we
ought
to
enable
strike
suits,
enable
people
to
be
accused
of
having
sold
an
option
in
order
to
protect
somebody
who's
foolish
enough
to
invest
a
million
dollars
on
the
basis
of
a
handshake.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
somewhere
in
that
long
sentence
you
made
the
point
that
in
blue
chip
there
was
no
solid
written
evidence
as
you
say
there
was
in
your
case.
do
you
think
blue
chip
would
have
come
out
differently
if
there
was
solid
written
evidence
to
demonstrate
that
the
alleged
purchaser
would
have
purchased?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
so
what
difference--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay,
what
difference
does
it
make
if
you
have
written
evidence?
and
blue
chip
didn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
blue
chip
wouldn't
come
out
any
differently,
written
evidence
or
not,
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
fine,
but
the
evidence
makes
up...
the
evidence,
or
the
existence
of
written
evidence
or
not
makes
no
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes
or
no?
the
existence
of
written
evidence
or
not
in
this
case
makes
no
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
wasn't
that
sale
worth
a
million
dollars,
or
whatever
the
statute
of
frauds
limit
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
surely
that
contract
is
worth
something,
and
what
was
the
value
of
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
is
that
below
the
state's
statute
of
frauds
amount?
that
million
dollars?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
answer,
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cohen,
though,
the
federal
court
determined
what
the
state
statute
of
frauds
was
in
this
case,
and
the
federal
court
determined
that
performance
took
this
out
of
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
i
disagree
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
performance
takes
a
contract
out
of
the
statute
where
you
have
a
bilateral
contract.
i
promise
to
do
one
thing,
you
promise
to
do
another.
one
of
us
performs.
the
contract
is
then
out
of
the
statute
of
frauds.
but
when
you
have
something
that
is
called
a
unilateral
contract,
if
you
do
something...
you
don't
have
to...
but
if
you
do
something,
then
i
am
obligated
to
do
something
else.
and
that's
what
you
have
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
did
these
things,
you
will
have...
i
will
give
you
an
option.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
did
the
things,
you
got
the
option.
that
is
what
concluded
the
contract,
and
i
would
not
hold
it,
if
i
were
the
state
supreme
court
judge,
that
that
statute
was
out
of
the
state
statute
of
frauds.
justice
antonin
scalia
were
you
obliged...
were
you
obliged
to
go
out
and
do
those
acts
which
created
the
option
for
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
promise
to
do
those
acts?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
contract
was
within
the
statute
of
frauds
then,
because
there
certainly
wasn't
any
performance
of
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
not
an
option.
that
promise
is
not
a
security.
if
you
promise
to
do
some
act,
and
i,
in
exchange,
promise
that
if
you
do
the
act
i
will
give
you
an
option...
that
contract
is
not
an
option
and
is
not
therefore
a
security.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
that
the
respondent
here
could
have
been
sued
for
breach
of
contract
if
the
respondent
did
not
perform
those
services?
i
didn't
read
the
transaction
as
really
envisioning
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
that
would
follow,
but
you
think
that
that
was
the
reality?
that
the
respondent
could
have
been
sued
if
it
didn't
send
those
people
over
to
do
the
work
that
was...
you
see,
i
viewed
it
as
much
more
of
a
unilateral
contract.
if
you
send
the
people
over,
you'll
have
an
option.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it
does
for
the
statute
of
fraud
purpose.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
old
do
you
have
to
be
to
buy
a
security?
you
mean
we
can
adopt
a
federal
rule
that
sixteen
year
olds
can
buy
securities?
justice
antonin
scalia
surely
that's
a
question
of
state
law,
isn't
it?
