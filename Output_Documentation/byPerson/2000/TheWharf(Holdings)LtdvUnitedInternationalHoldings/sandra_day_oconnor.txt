the
seller
of
an
option?
justice
sandra

o'connor
would
you
rephrase
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
was
not
an
agreement
to
be
performed?
do
you
think
the
sale
took
place?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
say
what
happened
was
that
wharf
said
i
give
you
an
option
today,
and
in
return
you
must,
in
the
future,
perform
certain
services.
was
that
the
agreement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
the
concern,
mr.
roberts,
is
that
we
not
sweep
in
under
the
securities
act
a
lot
of
breach
of
contract
suits.
justice

o'connor
yes,
it's
easily--
