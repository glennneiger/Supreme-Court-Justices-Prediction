mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
when
the
seller
of
a
stock
option
misrepresents
its
intention
to
permit
the
buyer
to
exercise
the
option,
the
seller
violates
section
10(b).
the
text
of
section
10(b)
prohibits
the
use
of
any
manipulative
or
deceptive
device
in
connection
with--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--the
seller
of
the
option.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
which
here
is
wharf
cable...
sold
the
stock
option
which
was
the
right
to
purchase...
excuse
me.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
a
sale
took
place.
at
the
meeting,
there
was
a
contract,
as
was
explained,
the
contract
was
an
exchange
of
a
promise
to
provide
services
for
the
sale
of
the
option.
the
promise
was
performed--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i
sell
you
an
option
in
exchange
for
your
promise
to
perform
services,
and
that
there
was
performance,
which
would
take
that
contract
out
of
the
statute
of
frauds.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
under
the
understanding
that
there
was
a
sale
for
a
promise,
yes.
you
know,
under
the
understanding
there
was
a
sale
for
services.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
there
was
performance
of
the
promise
which
would
take
it
out
of
the
statute
of
frauds.
even
if
it
is
was
a
contract
that
was
unilateral,
the
performance
of
the
services
would
take
it
out
of
the
statute
of
frauds
as
well,
and
once
the
option
was
purchased,
the
option
was
a
security,
and
the
misrepresentation
of
the
intention
to
permit
the
exercise
of
the
option
was
a
misrepresentation.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
what
the
jury
found
was
that
they
entered
into
a
contract
selling
them
an
option
for...
to
purchase
ten
percent
of
the
stock.
i
don't
recall
right
at
the
moment...
i
don't
have
it
in
front
of
me...
that
finding.
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
said
in
exchange
for
the
promise
or
not
in
the
specific
language
of
that
finding,
but
the
finding
was
on
page
e21.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
your
honor,
and
you
don't
do
that,
because
in
order
for
there
to
be
a
10(b)(5)
violation,
there
must
be
a
misrepresentation.
there
has
to
be
a
fraud,
not
just
a
breach
of
contract.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it's
not
sufficient,
your
honor.
just
as
it's
easy
to
allege,
it's
very
hard
to
prove.
in
order
to
avoid
dismissal
under
the
private
litigation
securities
reform
act,
the
plaintiff
has
to
allege
with
particularity
facts
that
give
rise
to
a
belief
that
there
was
misrepresentation--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--that
would
be
insufficient
to
meet
that
burden,
your
honor.
the
fact
that
he's
defending
a
suit,
obviously,
would
be
insufficient.
and
the
plaintiff's
own
testimony
about
what
he
thought
the
defendant's
intention
was
does
not
prove
the
state
of
the
defendant's
mind,
nor
does
the
fact
that
the
defendant
failed
to
perform
prove
anything
more
than
a
breach
of
contract.
the
restatement
makes
that
clear...
that
same
principle
would
apply.
failure
to
perform
alone
is
not
sufficient.
there
has
to
be
additional
evidence,
and
there
was
additional
evidence
in
this
case...
both
testimonial
and
documentary
evidence...
that
there
was
no
intention
to
perform
at
the
time.
in
addition,
it's
important
to
understand
that...
it's
important
to
cover
oral
contracts
such
as
these
because
many
contracts
for
the
purchase
of
securities
are
oral,
such
as
when
customers
contract
with
their
brokers
over
the
telephone
to
buy
stock.
and
oral
contracts
for
the
sale
of
securities
are
generally
enforceable
under
the
law
of
all
fifty
states.
in
addition
to
that,
the
act
does
not
require
that
there
be
a
writing
to
make
someone
a
purchaser
or
a
seller
of
a
security.
the
act
provides
that
the
options
are
securities,
and
the
act
also
provides
that
a
purchase
includes
any
contract
purchase.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
i
think
the
statute
of
frauds
is
irrelevant
to
a
violation
of
section
10(b).
the
statute
of
frauds
is
a--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--there
is
no
requirement.
even
under
common
law,
the
traditional
rule
is
that
fraud
in
inducing
a
contract
is
actionable,
even
if
the
contract
is
unenforceable
under
the
statute
of
frauds.
the
same
principle
applies
to
section
10(b),
as
well,
and--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--whether
something...
no,
a
contract
is
a
federal
term
in
the
statute;
it
is
a
federal
question,
i
think
whether
it's
a
contract--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--there's
court
authority
for
the
fact
that
purchasers...
parties
to
an
oral
contract
to
purchase
are
purchasers
of
securities.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
notwithstanding
state
law?
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
they
don't
specifically
address
notwithstanding
state
law,
but
in
the
court
of
appeals
case
that
comes
to
mind,
the
threadgill
case
from
the
d.c.
circuit,
the
district
court
had
said
that
there
was
no
purchase
or
sale
because
the
contract
had
not
been
performed,
fully
performed,
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
said
that
the
act
defines
contract
to
include...
the
act
defines
purchase,
excuse
me,
to
include
any
contract
to
purchase.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
it
wouldn't
serve
the
purposes
of
the
securities
act
for--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--first,
you
don't
have
to
address
that
issue
here
because
there
is
a--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i
don't
think
that
you
should
look
to
state
law
for
any
of
these
questions,
your
honor.
it's
a
question
of--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--if
there's
fraud--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--whether
it's
a
sale
under
state
law
is
a
question
of
state
law,
whether
it's
a
sale
for
purposes
of
the
securities
act
is
a
question
of
federal
law.
and
it
wouldn't
serve
the
purposes
of
section
10(b)
to
hold
that
because
there
isn't
a
sale
that's
enforceable
under
state
law--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes,
your
honor,
congress
does.
but
congress
simply
used
the
term
contract
in
the
definition
of
purchase
to
include
any
contract,
and
used
the
term
contract,
and
that
was
commonly
understood
at
that
time,
if
i
may
issue
that
answer.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
sorry.
thank
you.
