we'll
hear
argument
on
number
00-347,
the
wharf
limited,
et
al.,
v.
united
international
holdings.
mr.
dodyk.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
would
certainly
take
it
beyond
the
holding
of
the
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
it
has
very
little
to
do
with
the
writing
and
much
more
to
do
with
the
inherent
ineffability
of
future
intentions.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
reasoning,
mr.
dodyk?
you
know,
there's
some
english
chancellor
hundreds
of
years
ago
said
that
the
state
of
a
man's
mind
is
as
much
a
question
of
fact
as
the
state
of
his
digestion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cohen,
i
think...
what
if
this
contract
were
found
to
be
void
because
it
didn't
comply
with
the
colorado
statute
of
fraud?
could
it
nonetheless
be
acted
upon?
in
other
words,
would
that
be
a
final
death
knell
for
your
suit,
or
can
you
say
that
under
federal
securities
law
that
isn't
conclusive?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
get
to
the
answer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can't
get
to
the
answer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
even
though
we're
invalid
under
colorado
statute
of
frauds,
it
could
proceed
under
the
federal
securities
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cohen.
mr.
roberts,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whether
or
not
something
is
a
contract...
does
that
depend
on
state
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
a
court
authority
for
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
say
notwithstanding
state
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
state
contract
law,
not
statute
of
frauds.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
to
say
it
wouldn't
serve
the
purposes
of
section
10(b)
isn't
the
final
answer
on
a
case
like
this.
congress
legislates
with
a
background
of
what
has
been
decided
under
state
law,
and
what
is
a
matter
of
federal
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
you
may
not.
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
