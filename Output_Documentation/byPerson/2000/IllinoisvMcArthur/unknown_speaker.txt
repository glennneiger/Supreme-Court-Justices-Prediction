unknown
speaker
well,
can
we
take
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
there's
a
substantial
risk
that
in
this
context
he
would
have
destroyed
the
evidence?
unknown
speaker
and
the
reasons
are?
the
reasons
are?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
he
knew
they
were
present--
unknown
speaker
but
in
any
case
she
didn't
say
anything
one
way
or
the
other
about
quantity--
unknown
speaker
--as
far
as
the
record
tells
us.
unknown
speaker
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
if
it
were
different...
if,
for
example...
some
counties
around
the
country
don't
prosecute
on
cases
like
this,
or
maybe
the
quantity
would
have
to
be
a
little
smaller.
if
they
had
a
policy
of
not
prosecuting
minimal
amounts
of
possession
of
marijuana,
then
i
take
it,
it
would
or
would
not
be
reasonable
to
go
in?
unknown
speaker
could
they
have
arrested
this
defendant
without
a
warrant,
without
an
arrest
warrant--
unknown
speaker
--based
on
the
information
that
they
had?
unknown
speaker
you
think
they
didn't
need
an
arrest
warrant,
they
could
just
have--
unknown
speaker
no,
but
even
apart
from
this,
and
just
as
a
general
rule,
why
shouldn't
that
be
the
general
rule,
that
the
police
would
have
to
establish
a
felony
level
before
they
go
into
a
house
to
arrest
without
a
warrant?
unknown
speaker
let
me
make
the
question
a
little
more
precise.
does
the
seriousness
of
the
offense
weigh
into
the
analysis
at
all
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
the
other
thing
i
wondered
about
is,
what
would
have
happened...
this
case
arose
out
of
an
argument
between
the
husband
and
wife,
as
i
remember.
what
if
she
changed
her
mind
when
she
got
to
the
magistrate
and
decided
not
to
support
the
probable
cause
and
they
never
got
the
warrant,
would
the
seizure
then
have
been
unlawful?
unknown
speaker
does
the
legality
depend
on
the
fact
that
the
warrant
was
ultimately
issued?
unknown
speaker
even
if
the
warrant
were
not
issued?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't...
sorry.
unknown
speaker
she...
the
wife
says,
who
lives
in
the
trailer
with
the
husband,
that
her
husband
has
put
pot
under
the
couch.
unknown
speaker
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
no,
but
seriously,
i
mean,
what...
how
could
that
standard
ever
be
satisfied
in
the
case
justice
breyer
gave
you,
except
on...
you
know,
some
silly
assumption
like
that?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now
what
i'm
trying
to--
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
at
page
7
of
your--
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
in
your
brief
in
opposition
you
said,
although
probable
cause
existed,
and
the
police,
so
forth,
so
on.
you
did,
i
think
in
your
brief
in
opposition,
you
assumed
there
was
probable
cause.
unknown
speaker
all
right--
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
we
could
posit
a
situation
in
which
officers
think
that
a
really
big
drug
ring
is
cutting
heroin
in
a
particular
apartment,
and
you
certainly
wouldn't
expect
them
to
knock
on
the
door
and
say,
you
know,
are
you
guys
cutting
heroin
in
there,
do
you
mind
if
we
come
in
and
look,
and
they
say
no,
we
don't
want
you
to
come
in
and
look.
whereupon,
they
burst
in
on
the
basis
of
exigent
circumstances.
i
suppose
we
wouldn't
allow
that,
would
we,
so
you
don't
have
to
be
frank
with
the
criminal.
it's
sometimes
a
good
idea
not
to
be
frank
with
the
criminal.
unknown
speaker
is
get
a
warrant.
unknown
speaker
i
agree.
unknown
speaker
even
without
exigent
circumstances
you
think
that
he
could
have
made
the
exclusion
from
the
house?
