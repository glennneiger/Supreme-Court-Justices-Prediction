chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
99-1132,
illinois
v.
charles
mcarthur.
mr.
bertocchi.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bertocchi,
how
far
did
the
police
have
to
go
geographically
to
get
a
warrant
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
question
presented
is,
is
it
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment
for
police
officers
who
have
probable
cause
to
believe
a
residence
contains
evidence
enough
to
secure
the
residence
from
the
outside,
so
your
question
certainly
assumes
the
existence
of
probable
cause.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
doesn't
really
say
anything
about
exigent
circumstances.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
probable
cause
is
enough.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
bertocchi.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
roberts,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
maybe
the
police
officer
could
go
in
himself
and
bring
the
kid
outside.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
ms.
jones,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
offense
in
welsh
was
quite
different
than
the
one
here.
here,
according
to
your
colleague
at
any
rate,
this...
the...
it
could...
was
grounds
for
arrest,
and
also
he
could
have
served
time
in
jail.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
that
important,
ms.
jones,
to
your
argument?
i
mean,
supposing
there
had
been
a
large
stash
of
heroin.
would
that
make
this
case
different?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
surprised
you
say
that
no
one
was
taking
this
seriously
when
the
police
went
to
get
a
warrant
and
secured
the
house.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
know,
there's
always
a
great
deal
of
second
guessing
in
these
fourth
amendment
cases.
if
the
police
do
a,
they
should
have
done
b,
and
if
they
do
b,
they
should
have
done
a.
so
i
think
you
have
to
base
your
case
on
the
infirmities
in
what
the
police
actually
did.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
challenge
the
question
presented
in
your
brief
in
opposition?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
and...
but
it
is...
is
it
reasonable
under
the...
for
police
officers
who
have
probable
cause,
so
that
is
the
premise
of
the
question
presented,
that
the
police
officers
have
probable
cause.
unless
you
disputed
that,
you're
not
in
a
position
now
to
challenge
probable
cause.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
now,
that
is
obviously
an
argument
you're
very
much
entitled
to
make,
but
i
think
you've
been
making
a
different
one,
that
there
was
no
probable
cause,
and
i
think
it's
questionable
whether
you're
entitled
to
make
that
argument
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
basically
arguing,
then,
if
you
say
there's
no
probable...
that
the
decision
should
be
affirmed
on
an
alternate
ground?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
question
presented
says,
is
it
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment
for
a
police
officer
who
had
probable
cause
to
believe
a...
this
is
probable
cause
for
the
police
officers
to
act.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
fact
you
say
you
concede
there's
probable
cause
to
issue
the
search
warrant
doesn't
really
get
to
that
point,
does
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
precisely,
and
that's
what
the
question
raises,
and
that's
what
the
lower
courts
found
against
you.
that's
what
you've
conceded
in
your
brief
in
opposition.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
jones.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bertocchi,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bertocchi.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-1132,
illinois
versus
mcarthur
will
be
announced
by
justice
breyer.
