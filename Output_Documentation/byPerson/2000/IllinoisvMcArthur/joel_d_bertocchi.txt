mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
thank
you.
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
in
this
case,
a
police
officer
who
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
readily
destructible
evidence
was
concealed
in
charles
mcarthur's
home
secured
that
home
from
the
outside
while
his
partner
went
to
see
the
judge
to
get
a
warrant.
by
doing
so,
the
police
officer,
officer
love,
prevented
what,
as
it
turned
out,
would
have
been
the
certain
destruction
of
that
evidence.
he
also
avoided
doing
something
that
this
court
has
often
condemned
in
its
fourth
amendment
cases.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
i
don't
think
they
knew
it,
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
correct.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
i
agree.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
your
honor,
by
mentioning
that
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that
the
court
should.
i
think
that
demonstrates
something
about
the
fact
that
people
can
intend
to
destroy
evidence
without
telegraphing
it.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
but
i
agree
that
the
officers
certainly
didn't
know
it.
mr.
mcarthur
didn't
say
so.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
i
agree,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
police
believed
that,
that
they
were
concerned
about
the
risk
to
evidence,
but
i
can't
say
that
they
could
read
his
mind.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
in
this
case
they
could
have,
although
i
would
emphasize
again
that
they
never
actually
went
in
at
all
except
briefly
with--
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
--i
believe
that
is
so,
your
honor,
and
certainly
it
demonstrates
that
the
intrusion
that
we're
asking
for
here
is
amply
justified.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
i
understand
that
argument,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
believe
it
applies
in
this
case
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
one
is
that
i
believe
the
officers
had
genuine
concern
sufficient
to
allow
them
to
impound,
certainly,
and
perhaps
to
go
in
even
before
they
spoke
with
him.
mrs.
mcarthur
told
the
officers
that
she
had
just
seen
mr.
mcarthur
conceal
the
marijuana
under
the
couch.
she
told
them
that
when
she
came
out
into
the
house,
and
i
believe
that
that
told
the
officers
not
only
that
there
was
marijuana
inside,
which
provided
them
with
probable
cause
to
search,
i
think
that
also
demonstrated
to
them
that
mr.
mcarthur,
or
at
least
would
give
them
reasonable
grounds
to
suspect
that
mr.
mcarthur
was
interested
in
preventing
them
from
getting
access
to
the
evidence
and
had
already
at
least
once
translated
that
idea
into
action.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
i...
your
honor,
i...
that
isn't
what
i
intended
to
say,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
your
honor,
i
don't
believe...
i
do
believe
that
they
did.
i
don't...
i
do
believe--
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
--the
reasons
are,
your
honor,
that
they...
as
i
indicated,
that
they
had...
they
were
aware
that
mr.
mcarthur,
while
they
were
present,
and
he
knew
they
were
present,
had
already
taken
action
to
conceal
the
evidence
from
them,
and
i
think
it
would
be
reasonable
for
them
to
believe
that
he
might
take
additional
action,
or
decide
that
that
action
wasn't
sufficient.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
in
addition,
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that--
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
--yes,
your
honor.
he...
the
police
had
been
outside
for
some
time
while
mrs.
mcarthur
was
moving
her
items
out,
and
they
wouldn't
have
been
very
good
peacekeepers
if
they
didn't
let
it
be
known,
or
she
didn't
let
it
be
known
that
the
police
were
outside
while
she
was
moving
her
items
out.
so
at
the
time
mrs.
mcarthur
came
out
and
said
all
this,
the
police
knew
that
mr.
mcarthur
knew
they
had
been
outside
for
some
time,
that
they
were
in
the
company
of
his
wife,
who
was
angry
at
him
and
might
be
motivated
to
snitch
on
him,
and
she
also
told
them
that
he
had
already
taken
at
least
some
action
to
conceal
marijuana,
the
marijuana
that
was
inside,
from
them.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
your
honor,
she
did
not
say
anything...
there
is
no
testimony
in
the
record
that
she
said
anything
other
than
that
it
was
marijuana,
and
that
is
really
one
of
our
central
points
in
response
to
that
argument,
is
that
the
officers
had
no
reason
to
know
just
what
the
stakes
would
be
for
any
number
of
reasons.
one
of
them
was
that.
it
is
certainly
unlikely
that
if
they
had
asked
her
mrs.
mcarthur
could
have
said
2.3
grams.
at
most
she
might
have
said,
a
little,
but
a
little
can
rise
to
the
level
of
a
felony
in
illinois,
and
even
a
little
little
is
a
jailable
crime.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
correct.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
that
is
correct.
your
honors,
officer
love's
conduct
in
this
case
was
restrained
and,
indeed,
specifically
calibrated
to
intrude
no
more
than
necessary
while
giving
full
effect
to
the
warrant
requirement,
and
we
ask
that
this
court
approve
that
conduct
because
it
will
both
protect
both
evidence
and
privacy.
there
are
two
facts
that
we
believe
demonstrate
that
officer
love's
conduct
fell
clearly
within
the
limits
of
reasonable
conduct
under
the
fourth
amendment.
one
of
them,
of
course,
is
that
there
was
no
entry
necessary
in
this
case,
and
we
believe
that
that
substantially
lesser
intrusion
is
very
important.
it
interfered
only
with
mr.
mcarthur's
possessory
interest
in
his
home,
and
while
those
interests
are
certainly
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment,
the...
they
are
not...
they
do
not
receive
the
high
level
of
protection
that
privacy
interests
do,
particularly
where
a
home
is
concerned.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
your
honor,
i
think
on
this
record
the
most
you
could
say
would
be
2
hours,
but
i
believe
that
the
more
justified
conclusion
would
be
about
an
hour
and
15
minutes
from
the
time
the
impoundment
was
imposed
to
the
time
that
the
warrant
was
signed.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
was
a
much
harder
case,
but
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances
that
caused
it
to
take
that
long.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
i
think
this
is
an
amount
of
time
that
you
could
almost
say
was
per
se
reasonable.
i
think,
in
fact,
that
it
was
surprisingly
brief,
in...
particularly
in
light
of
the
fact
that
this
is
a
small
rural
jurisdiction
with
a
small
police
force
and--
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
--certainly,
your
honor.
i
know
the
court
has
said
on
many
occasions
that
an
intrusion
on
fourth
amendment
rights
can
start
off
okay
and
become
unreasonable
by
degree.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
your
honor,
i
think
under
welsh
you
can't
say
that
it
doesn't
figure
into
the
fourth
amendment
calculus.
we
believe
that
there
was
ample
justification
in
this
case
in
light
of
the
quantity
of
marijuana.
this
is
a
case
which
the
state
of
illinois
legislature
has
decided
you
can
go
to
jail
for.
this
is
a
case
that
the
county
prosecutor,
who
is
the
original
jurisdiction
prosecutor
in
the
county,
has
decided
was
worth
a
search
warrant--
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
--your
honor,
i
think
if
they
had
a
blanket
policy
that
was
known
to
the
police
officers,
then
i
think
they
would...
you
know,
before
they
even
got
to
that
question
they
would
doubt,
or
be
sure
that
they
couldn't
get
the
prosecutor
to
approve
the
search
warrant
in
the
first
place.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
i
believe
that
they
could
have.
i
believe
they
had
probable
cause
both
to
search
the
house
and
to
arrest
mr.
mcarthur.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
your
honor,
i
am
not
aware
of
that.
i
know
that
mr.
mcarthur
lived
in
sullivan,
and
that
sullivan
is
the
county
seat
of
moultrie
county,
so
they
didn't
have
to
leave
the
town
of
sullivan
to
get
to
the
courthouse.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
your
honor,
i
agree
that
impoundment
does
present
something
of
a
complication,
but
i
don't
think
it's
that
serious,
and
i
think
that
the
test
is
not
all
that
different,
because
it's
a
balancing
test
ultimately,
always.
i
think
that
in
this
case
we
also
distinguish,
as
does--
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
--i
understand--
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
--well,
your
honor,
it's
our
position--
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
--your
honor,
if
the
court
were
to
agree
with
me
that
exigent
circumstances
were...
particularized
exigent
circumstances
were
present
here,
sufficient
to
allow
an
entry,
that
would
be
very
satisfactory,
because
i'm
sure
that
would
result
in
the--
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
no
specific
or
particularized
exigent
circumstances
were
required
to
do
what
officer
love
did.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
probable
cause
is
enough
that
you
don't
have
to
make
an
entry,
yes,
your
honor.
your
honors,
as
i
was
indicating
in
response
to
justice
stevens,
the
intrusion
in
this
case
lasted
a
surprisingly
brief
amount
of
time,
but
another
important
aspect
of
its
limitation
is
that
it
was
always
intended
only
as
a
step
on
the
way
to
getting
a
warrant.
impoundment
is
really
not
capable
of
analytical
separation
from
getting
a
search
warrant.
it
is
a
step
in
its
execution
which
is
designed
to
assure
that
if
there
is
evidence
in
the
house
at
the
time
probable
cause
arises,
it
will
still
be
there
by
the
time
the
judge...
the
officers
come
back
with
the
warrant
if
the
judge
signs
it.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
well,
your
honor,
in
this
case
i
think
if...
that
once
he
had
come
outside
the
house
they
could
have
arrested
him
because
they
had
probable
cause
to
arrest
him
and
then,
incident
to
that,
i
think
they
could
have
reached
into
his
pocket.
so
in
those
situations
where
there
is
probable
cause
to
arrest,
personal
search
issues
are
going
to
be
subsumed
in
search
of
the
person
incident
to
arrest.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
i
believe
that
when
they
had
this...
that...
the
record
demonstrates
that
mr.
mcarthur
came
out
of
his
house
to
speak
with
the
officers,
and
i
believe
that
at
that
point
he
was
in
a
public
place
and
could
be
arrested
without
a
warrant,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
i
believe
that...
i
believe
that
they
could
have,
again
based
on
the
exigent--
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
in
this
instance
had
they
gone
in
to--
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
in
some
cases
that
might
very
well
be
a
difficult
rule
to
administer,
and
i
think
this
is
a
good
example
of
that,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
mrs.
mcarthur
would
likely
have
been
able
to
give
them,
even
if
they
had
asked,
the
detail--
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
they
did
have
sufficient
cause
in
this
case
had
they
needed
to
enter
to
effectuate
this
impoundment,
but
i
don't
believe
that
they
needed
it
to
do
it
in
the
way
that
they
did.
if
there
are
no
other
questions
i
would
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
if
i
could.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
thank
you.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
your
honor,
i
believe
when
i
was
addressing
the
question
of
exigent
circumstances
that
i
was
doing
so
in
response
to
specific
questions
about
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
it
is
our
position
that
if
the
court
were
to
determine
that
particularized
exigent
circumstances
were
necessary,
then
they
were
present
if
the
court
wanted
to
ask
that.
we
do
stand
behind
the
question
presented.
we
do
believe
that
the
officer
had--
mr.
joel
d.
bertocchi
--yes,
i
believe
that,
your
honor.
that
is
our
position,
and
if
i
may
speak
up
for
the
question
presented
and
for
the
rule
it
proposes,
i
would
submit
that
that
is
not
going
to
be
a
difficult
rule
to
apply,
because
it
will
only
require
police
officers
to
know
two
things,
1)
that
they
have
probable
cause
to
search,
and
2)
the
character
of
the
evidence,
and
if
they
don't
know
that,
then
they
shouldn't
be
looking
for
a
warrant,
and
if
they
shouldn't
be
looking
for
a
warrant,
they
would
have
no
basis
and
no
need
to
impound.
thank
you,
your
honors.
