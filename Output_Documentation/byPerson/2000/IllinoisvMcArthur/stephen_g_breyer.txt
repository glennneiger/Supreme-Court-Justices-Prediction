justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
suppose...
is
it...
all
right,
the
wife
says,
i...
you
know,
she
lives
in
the
trailer
with
her
husband,
and
the
wife
says,
he
hides
dope
under
the
couch,
okay?
and
he's...
there's
some
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
happened.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
why
wouldn't
the
officer
think
that
if
i
say
goodbye,
i'm
going
off
to
get
a
search
warrant,
the
husband
would
take
the
dope
and
flush
it
down
the
toilet.
that's
what
i
would
think.
i
mean,
why
wouldn't
he
think
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
fact,
if
he's
intelligent,
that's
what
the
man
would
have
done.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
he
hadn't
been
let
into
the
house,
right?
he
hadn't
had
time,
or
had
he
had
time?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
i'm
just
saying,
is
there
any
reason
why
the
police
wouldn't
think,
if
he
gets
back
in
the
house,
he
will
go
take
the
marijuana
and
put
it
down
the
toilet?
is
there
anything
here
that
would
make
that
an
unreasonable
thing
to
think?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
isn't
that...
and
this
is
now
a
legal
question.
i
was
trying
to...
why
isn't
that
an
exigent
circumstance
that
would
give
the
policeman
the
right
to
go
in
and
preserve
the
evidence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--can
you
tell
me
this...
out
of
a
very...
say,
just
a
person
who
knew
nothing
about
the
law
approaches
this
and
says,
the
wife
says
there's...
he
put
some
pot
under
the
sofa.
the
policeman
then
goes
to
the
door
and
says,
did
you
put
pot
under
the
sofa?
he
says,
no.
okay?
off
to
get
a
search
warrant.
if
i
were
a
policeman
i
would
think,
he's
going
to
flush
that
right
down
the
toilet.
that's
where
we
left
off,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
i
would
think
that
instead
of
going
into
the
house,
which
i'm
not
sure
why
he
couldn't
have
done
it,
he
says,
look,
i'll
just
keep
you
outside
the
house.
that
way
i
don't
have
to
go
into
the
house.
i
would
think
he
might
have
gotten
a
fourth
amendment
medal,
instead
of
fourth
amendment
criticism,
because
what
he's
doing
is,
he's
trying
to
do
the
least
restrictive
thing
possible
consistent
with
the
evidence
being
preserved.
now,
why
isn't
what
he
did
a
good
thing
rather
than
a
bad
thing
from
a
fourth
amendment
point
of
view,
and
what
is
the
case
that
makes
it
impossible
for
him
to
do
that
thing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
haven't
said
what
a
rule
was.
i
just
wanted
to
say,
the
common
sense
of
it
seeming
to
be
that
he
should
keep
the
person
outside
rather
than
go
in
the
house,
and
the
only
alternative
being
that
you
have
to
let
these
people
who
have
marijuana
in
violation
of
the
law
destroy
the
evidence.
those
seem
to
me
to
be
the
two
alternatives.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
understand.
i'm
saying
why
exactly
can't
he
just
keep
the
person
outside?
i
would
say
from
a
fourth
amendment
point
of
view
you'd
say
yes,
he
can
keep
the
person
outside
because
it's
the
least
restrictive
way
to
preserve
the
evidence.
the
only
alternative
is
to
let
him
preserve
the
evidence.
now,
the
thing
that
would
be
wrong
with
that
hypothetical
rule
is
what?
i'm
not
saying
i
adopt
it.
i
just
want
to
get
what's
the
objection
to
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
you
say
there's
nothing
wrong
with
my
rule.
now,
you
must
think
there's
something
wrong
with
it,
because
you
want
to
come
out
the
other
way.
now,
one
thing
you'd
say
was
wrong
with
it
was
because
he
didn't
have
probable
cause.
we've
discussed
that
enough.
the
second
thing
you
think
is
wrong
with
it
is
because
the
circumstances
don't
justify
it.
you
use
this
word
exigent,
but
the
reason
why
they
don't
justify
it,
what
he's
got
before
him
is,
the
wife's
told
him
there's
pot
under
the
sofa,
the
man
lives
in
a
trailer,
he's
told
the
man
he's
looking
for
the
pot,
and
his
knowledge
of
human
nature.
all
right.
those
are
the
things
he
has
before
him.
now,
why
isn't
that
enough?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
asking
you
why
that
isn't
enough
to
justify
keeping
the
man
outside
the
trailer
so
he
won't
destroy
the
evidence.
that's
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
tera
mcarthur
asked
two
police
officers
to
accompany
her
to
a
trailer
home
where
she
lived
with
her
husband
charles,
so
that
she
could
take
her
belongings
out
of
the
home.
just
after
she
came
out
of
the
trailer
with
her
things
she
told
the
police
that
charles
had
some
drugs
inside.
the
police
knocked,
they
asked
charles
if
they
could
search,
he
said
no,
he
then
came
out
of
the
trailer
and
eventually
one
of
the
policeman
stopped
charles
from
going
back
into
the
trailer
while
the
other
one
went
off
to
get
a
warrant.
the
illinois
court
later
held
at
the
trial
of
charles
mcarthur
that
this
police
restrained
stopping
him
from
going
back
into
the
trailer,
while
they
were
going
to
look
for
a
search
warrant,
violated
the
fourth
amendment.
today
we
disagree
with
that
conclusion.
we
have
examined
the
restraint
that
the
police
imposed
in
order
to
decide
whether
it
was
reasonable
in
fourth
amendment
terms,
and
we
conclude
that
it
was.
the
police
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
mcarthur’s
trailer
home
contain
drugs.
there
are
both
evidence
of
a
crime
and
contraband.
they
had
good
reason
to
fear
that
unless
restrained
charles
mcarthur
would
destroy
the
drugs
before
they
could
come
back
with
the
warrant.
they
imposed
the
restraint
for
a
limited
time,
two
hours;
during
that
time
they
acted
with
diligence
to
obtain
a
warrant,
and
hence
consequently
in
imposing
this
limited
restraint
for
a
limited
time
they
made
reasonable
efforts
to
reconcile
law
enforcement
needs
with
the
demands
of
personal
privacy.
we
do
not
believe
the
fourth
amendment
requires
more.
for
these
and
related
reasons
we
revere
the
illinois
court’s
contrary
determination.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
