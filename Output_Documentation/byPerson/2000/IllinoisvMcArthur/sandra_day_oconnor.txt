justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
stop
you
there,
please,
counsel?
as
it
turns
out,
and
you
mentioned,
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
respondent
would
have
entered
the
home
and
destroyed
the
evidence
if
he'd
had
the
chance,
but
the
police
didn't
know
that
at
the
time,
did
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
think
that
we
have
to
take
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
they
didn't
know.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
i
don't
think
we
should
look
at
the
fact
that
he
said
that
later
in
resolving
the
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
was
suggested
in
segura,
i
guess,
as
a
possible
rule.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
should
the
police
have
done
to
preserve
evidence
that
they
know
is
at
risk?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
they
knew
of
the
risk
of
destruction
of
the
evidence.
my
question
is,
what
could
they
do
to
preserve
the
evidence
in
these
circumstances,
nothing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
wouldn't
an
arrest
have
been
more
intrusive?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
have
thought
so.
i
would
have
thought
that
the
police
were
acting
in
a
restrained
fashion
by
getting
a
search
warrant,
finding
out
what
they
had,
and
then
taking
action.
an
immediate
arrest
would
have
i
think
been
more
of
a
personal
intrusion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
don't
think
i
agree
with
that.
they
had
been
told
that
he
had
marijuana
in
his
possession
and
i
don't
know
what
all,
and
that's
probable
cause,
isn't
it,
to
suspect
that
he
was
in
possession
of
marijuana?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
wasn't
a
warrant
obtained
from
a
magistrate
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
was
it
obtained
without
probable
cause?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ms.
jones,
how
can
you
do
that?
the
appellate
court
of
illinois
found
that
the
police
had
probable
cause
here.
you
didn't
take
a
cross
appeal
from
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
would
assume
we
would
accept
that
finding.
i
don't
know
why
you're
here
arguing
there
was
no
probable
cause
at
the
scene.
that
seems
to
be
both
contrary
to
what
the
illinois,
appellate
court
of
illinois
found,
and
contrary
to
the
assumption
made
in
the
question
on
certiorari.
