ms.
deanne
f.
jones
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court--
the
question
presented
by
these
facts
is,
what
analysis
should
this
court
employ
in
determining
under
what
circumstances
and
by
what
method
the
police
can
seize
a
home
in
order
to
preserve
evidence
of
a
crime?
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
united
states
of
america
want
this
court
to
issue
a
broad
rule
that
it
is
always
all
right
for
police
officers
to
seize
a
home
on
the
basis
of
probable
cause
alone.
this
court
should
find
that
such
a
rule
violates
the
fourth
amendment
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
it
does
not
take
into
account
the
high
esteem
in
which
this
court's
decisions
place
the
home,
and
it
is
also
not
a
logical
extension
of
other
cases
concerning
the
seizure
of
property.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
your
honor,
in
the
dicta
in
segura
there
is
some
suggestion
that
external
seizure
of
the
home
would
have
been
justified
in
segura's
case,
and
perhaps
that
is
because
everyone
with
a
possessory
interest
in
the
apartment
in
segura
was
in
custody
and
therefore
the
police
really
weren't
interfering
with
anyone's
possessory
right.
in
this
case
you
do
have
the
homeowner
present,
and
his
possessory
rights
in
the
home
are
being
substantially
interfered
with,
and
the
government's
test
of
probable
cause
only
simply
does
not
take
in
to
account
the
high
esteem
in
which
the
home
is
held
and
the
fact
that
it's
very
intrusive.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
your
honor,
there
were
two
alternatives
for
the
police
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
once
mrs.
mcarthur
told
the
officers
that
she
saw
her
husband
slide
marijuana
under
the
couch,
the
first
thing
they
could
have
done
is
simply
left
with
mrs.
mcarthur,
went
down
to
the
courthouse,
and
obtained
a
search
warrant.
the
second
alternative
was
to--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--no,
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
they
could
do,
and
the
reason
i'm
suggesting
that
is,
in
welsh
v.
wisconsin
the
officers
on
that
scene
were
faced
with
a
similar
dilemma.
the
only
way
they
had
to
preserve
evidence
of
mr.
welsh's
blood
alcohol
level
is
to
do
what
they
did,
which
was
to
enter
the
home
without
a
warrant
and
arrest
him
before
his
blood
alcohol
level
went
down.
this
court
found
that
because
that
was
a
minor
offense,
the
police
officers
could
not
do
that
in
order
to--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--your
honor,
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
offense
here
and
the
one
in
welsh.
welsh
was
a
nonjailable
offense,
that's
true.
here,
we
have
a
class
c
misdemeanor,
which
is
the
lowest
category
of
crime.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
yes,
your
honor,
it
would
make
this
case
different,
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
i'm
suggesting
you
reject
the
probable
cause
only
test
and
stick
with
the
probable
cause
plus
exigent
circumstances
test,
and
the
reason
the
quantity
of
the
drugs
would
be
important
is
because
that
goes
to
the
exigency.
as
this
court
observed
in
welsh
v.
wisconsin,
the
prevention
of
the
destruction
of
evidence
is
not
an
exigent
circumstance
when
you're
talking
about
a
minor
offense.
presumably,
then,
it
is
when
you're
talking
about
a
major
crime.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
two
responses
to
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
line
that
i'm
drawing
is
that
the
officers
have
to
have
probable
cause
and
exigent
circumstances.
in
this
case,
it's
my
position
that
they
had
neither,
but
the
line
i'm
asking
the
court
to
draw
again
is
probable
cause
and
exigent
circumstances.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
i
am,
your
honor,
that's
true,
and
the
reason
i
make
the
distinction
is
again,
it's
part
of
that
analysis
of
whether
or
not
the
exigent
circumstance
of
destruction
of
evidence
is
present.
that's
at
least
what
the
welsh
decision
suggests,
that
if
you're
trying
to
preserve
evidence
of
a
minor
crime,
then
the
officers
are
not
justified
in
entering
the
home
to
preserve
evidence
of
that
crime,
so
it's
a
factor
of
determining
whether
or
not
there's
an
exigent
circumstance
of
destruction
of
evidence.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
your
honor,
if
i
may,
she
had
a
question
before
that.
you
had
also
asked
me
about
if
the
officers
knew
about
the
quantity
of
marijuana
at
the
scene.
the
officers
i'm
sure
did
not
know
that
there
were
precisely
2.3
grams
of
marijuana
present.
however,
the
officers
could
easily
have
asked
mrs.
mcarthur
about
the
quantity
she
saw,
and
the
fact
that
nobody
really
seemed
to
be
taking
this
incident
very
seriously
suggests
that
the
officers
knew
they
weren't
talking
about--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--your
honor,
if
they...
they
didn't
ask
mrs.
mcarthur
questions
about
the
quantity.
they
didn't
ask
her
questions
about
whether
her
husband
was
dealing
drugs.
if
they
thought
they
had
a
serious
offense
and
they
thought
they
had
probable
cause
at
the
scene
they
could
have
placed
mr.
mcarthur
under
arrest
immediately.
mr.
mcarthur
evidently--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--your
honor,
they
did
go
and
get
a
warrant,
but
what
i'm
suggesting
is,
you're
not
taking
about
a
major
crime
here
where
the
police
felt
that
they
had
the
immediate
need
to
make
an
arrest
of
mr.
mcarthur.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
yes,
your--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--your
honor--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--your
honor,
again
i'm
suggesting
that
because
the
officers
did
not
have
probable
cause
at
the
scene
they
could
not
arrest--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--your
honor,
i
respectfully
disagree
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
mr....
or,
excuse
me,
officer
love
did
not
ask
mrs.
mcarthur
that
very
important
question
of
whether
she
was
familiar
with
what
marijuana
looked
like.
under
illinois
law,
when
you
gather
information
from
an
informant
about
the
existence
of
contraband,
illinois
law
generally
requires
that
you
have
some
indication--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--your
honor,
it
was,
and
if
you--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--no.
your
honor,
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
search
warrant,
and
if
you
compare
the
search
warrant
application
and
the
affidavit
submitted...
you'll
find
those
in
the
joint
appendix,
i
believe
beginning
on
page
5.
if
you
look
at
the
application
for
a
search
warrant
and
the
affidavits,
there's
a
lot
of
information
contained
in
those
affidavits
that
were
not...
that
was
not
given
to
officer
love
at
the
scene.
for
example,
in
the
application
for
a
search
warrant
the
state's
attorney
thinks
it's
important
enough
to
put
in
there
that
mrs.
mcarthur
is
familiar
with
the
appearance
of
marijuana.
the
state's
attorney
also
includes
in
there
that
mrs.
mcarthur
has
seen
marijuana
on
the
presence...
or
on
the
premises
several
times.
he
has
her
put
in
the
affidavit
that
she
has
seen
her
husband
use
marijuana
on
several
occasions.
none
of
that
information
was
given
to
officer
love
at
the
scene.
all
officer
love
had
at
the
scene
was
a
woman
who
officer
love
admits
was
predisposed
into
getting
her
husband
into
trouble
tell
him
as
she's
leaving,
oh,
by
the
way,
i
just
saw
him
slide
some
dope
under
the
couch.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
i'm
sorry.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
mm
hmm.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
yes.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
your
honor,
in
this
case
there
were--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--well,
your
honor,
from
the
record,
what
we
know
what
mr.
mcarthur
did
is
when
the
police
arrived
on
the
scene,
he
didn't
flush
the
marijuana.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
the
officers
had
not
been
let
into
the
house,
but
they
were
certainly
outside,
and
mr.
mcarthur
was
aware
of
their
presence,
yet
he
didn't
take
any
steps
to
destroy
the
evidence.
he
simply
hid
it
under
his
couch.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
your
honor,
it
may
be
a
reasonable
thing
to
think,
but
that
certainly
does
not
then
give
the
police
the
power
to
take
the
next
step,
which
is
to
either
seize
the
home
or
make
a
warrantless
arrest.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
your
honor,
the
reason
why
it's
not
is--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--this
court's
holding
in
vale
v.
louisiana
suggests
that
evidence
has
to
be
in
the
process
of
destruction
before
it's
considered
to
be
an
exigent
circumstance
permitting
the
officer
to
make
a
warrantless
entry
inside.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
no,
your
honor.
i'm
not--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--your
honor,
i
agree
that
the
evidence
having
to
be
in
the
process
of
destruction
is
a
high
standard
for
the
police
to
meet,
and
that's
why
lower
courts
have
taken
the
vale
case
and
have
reduced
that
somewhat
to
require
a
fear
that
the
evidence
is
in
imminent
danger
of
destruction.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
i'm
sorry,
i'd
like
to
clarify.
are
you
asking
in
my
particular
case,
or
are
you
asking
in
general?
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
first
of
all,
the
reason
why
this
court
should
continue
with
that
standard
that
the
evidence
has
to
be
in
imminent
danger
of
destruction--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--your
honor,
the
reason
the
officers
should
not
have
considered
the
evidence
to
be
in
imminent
danger
of
destruction
is,
again,
mr.
mcarthur
took
no
steps
with
regard
to
that--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--your
honor,
first
of
all...
i
believe
this
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
i'm
sorry
i
don't
remember
the
page
number
for
this,
but
officer
love
or
mr.
mcarthur,
one
of
them
was
asked
the
question
whether
or
not
mrs.
mcarthur
saw
him
conceal
the
marijuana,
and
nobody
knew
the
answer
to
that,
so
first
of
all
maybe
mr.
mcarthur--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--your
honor,
i
would
disagree
that
it's
reasonable
to
infer
that
she
saw
them.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
your
honor,
i'm
claiming
there
was
no
probable
cause
and
no
exigent
circumstances,
and
a
probable--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--there
was
probable
cause
to
get
the
warrant
because
the
information
that
was
given
to
judge
flannel
was
different
than
the
information
that
officer
love
had
at
the
time
that
he
made
the
determination
to
seize
the
home.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
your
honor,
yes,
if
probable
cause
and
exigent
circumstances--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--existed,
yes.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
your
honor,
i'm
not
conceding
that
probable
cause
existed
in
this
case,
and
i'm
also
asserting
that
a
rule
that
permits
external
seizure
of
the
home
on
probable
cause
only
does
not
take
into
account,
first
of
all,
this
court's
holdings
with
respect
to
the
home
and
second
of
all,
does
not
really
weigh,
or
doesn't
fairly
balance
the
state's
interest
in
prosecuting
the
particular
kind
of
issue.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
your
honor,
we...
we're
still
sticking
with
the
question
presented,
whether
this
is
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
your
honor,
i
understand
what
the
question
presented
is
and,
as
a
general
rule,
we
disagree
that
that
ought
to
be
the
rule
that
applies
in
all
seizure
of
the
home
cases.
the
court,
or
excuse
me,
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
united
states
of
america
is
asking
this
court
to
permit
seizures
of
the
home
on
probable
cause
only,
and
it
is
our
contention
that
this
court
should
not
adopt
such
a
rule.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
your
honor,
i
guess
what
i'm
doing
is,
i'm
suggesting
that
no
matter
which
rule
you
adopt,
the
one
advocated
by
the
state
or
the
one
that
we're
presenting,
when
you
apply
that
rule
to
our
case
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
illinois
appellate
court
should
be
affirmed,
i'm
suggesting
to
you
reasons
that,
no
matter
which
rule
you
adopt,
the
decision
of
the
illinois
court--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--yes,
your
honor,
i'm--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--your
honor,
again,
we're
not
contesting
probable
cause
to
issue
the
search
warrant,
and
that's
true
the
illinois
appellate
court--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--yes.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
no,
your
honor.
you
have
to
look
at
the
probable
cause
at
the
time
that
the
home
was
seized.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
your
honor,
in
our
brief
in
opposition
we
do
state
that
the
illinois
appellate
court
was
incorrect
in
finding
that
we
never
contested
probable
cause.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
your
honor,
again,
let
me
state
that
i
do
accept
the
question
presented
as
it
is,
and
it's
our
argument
that
this
court
should
not
adopt
a
rule
that
permits
a
seizure
of
the
home
on
probable
cause
alone.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
okay.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
your
honor,
first
of
all,
if
you
adopt
that
rule,
then
you're
agreeing
with
the
state
and
the
united
states
of
america
that
probable--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--your
honor,
if
he's
keeping
the
person
outside
of
the
home
because
he
believes
it
contains
marijuana
and
he's
concerned
that
the
marijuana
is
going
to
be
destroyed--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--then
he's
making
the
seizure
on
probable
cause
and
exigent
circumstances,
and
that's
the
test
that
we
want
this
court
to
adopt
with
respect
to
seizures
of
the
home,
and--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--your
honor,
if
there's
probable
cause
and
exigent
circumstances,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that,
and
also
what
the
court
should
keep
in
mind
is
external
seizure
of
the
home
may
not
always
be--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--if
you're
asking
me
why
that
isn't
exigent
circumstances
in
this
particular
case--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--probable
cause
and
exigent
circumstances
would
be
sufficient
to
seize
a
home.
what
i'm
arguing
is,
that's
the
rule
we
want
you
to
adopt,
probable
cause
and
exigent
circumstances.
now,
when
that's
specifically
applied
to
our
case,
the
reason
there
are
no
exigent
circumstances
here
are
twofold.
one,
officer
love
is
the
person
that
created
the
exigency
of
the
destruction
of
evidence,
and
several
lower
courts
have
held
that
when
police
officers
create
the
exigency
of
destruction
of
evidence,
they
cannot
then
use
that
exigency
to
turn
around
and
enter
a
person's
home
without
a
warrant
in
order
to
preserve
that
evidence.
here,
officer
love
admitted--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
i
am
suggesting
that.
several
lower
courts,
including
the
seventh
circuit
in
united
states
v.
roselli,
have
held
that
when
it
is
reasonable
or
it
is
foreseeable
that
evidence
will
be
destroyed
if
you
ask
for
permission
to
search,
if
you
go
ahead
and
take
that
step
and
ask
for
consent
and
it's
denied,
you
can't
then
turn
around
and
use
that
exigency
to
enter
the
home
without
a
warrant,
because
the
police
have
created
the
exigency.
here,
if
you
look
on
page
20
of
the
joint
appendix,
officer
love
testifies
that
at
the
time
mrs.
mcarthur
told
him
that
mr.
mcarthur
hid
marijuana
under
the
couch,
mr....
or
mr.
mcarthur
was
still
free
to
come
and
go
from
his
home.
however,
once
officer
love
asks
mr.
mcarthur
for
permission
to
search
and
is
denied,
from
that
point
on,
mr.
mcarthur
can't
go
in
because
now
officer
love
is
concerned
that
the
evidence
is
about
to
be
destroyed.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
your
honor,
if
you
know
that
there's
an
apartment
where
people
are
cutting
drugs,
then
the
step
that
the
officers
should
take
in
that
hypothetical--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--they
should
have
went
and
gotten
a
warrant.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
no.
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
your
honor,
the
problem
with
having
that
be
the
standard
to
determine
the
exigent
circumstance
of
the
destruction
of
evidence
is
that
you
could
say
that
in
any
case
where
someone
has
evidence
of
a
crime
inside
of
their
home.
i
believe
justice
stevens--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--your
honor,
two
reasons
why
it
wouldn't
give
a
sufficient
exigency.
first
of
all,
the
police
were
out
at
the
mcarthurs
for
a
while
and
again,
mrs.
mcarthur
was
coming
and
going
out
of
the
trailer
this
whole
time
the
police
were
there.
evidently
mr.
mcarthur,
from
whatever
he
could
gather
from
what
was
occurring
there,
wasn't
concerned
enough
that
his
possession
of
marijuana
was
going
to
be
reported
that--
ms.
deanne
f.
jones
--thank
you.
