justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
if,
in
your
view,
the
length
of
time
that
it
takes
to
get
the
warrant
is
relevant
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
this
case,
what
was
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
took,
say,
8
or
10
hours,
you
would
say
that's
probably
unreasonable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
say
the
length
of
time
would
be
a
relevant
consideration?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
also...
what
is
your
position
on
whether
the
quantity
of
drugs
is
relevant
to
the
inquiry?
i
mean,
if
it
was
a
bomb
about
to
explode
you
take
one
view,
and
an
ounce
of
marijuana
you
can
get
a
little
different
reaction
intuitively,
but
do
you
think
legally
it
should
make
any
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
roberts,
do
you
think
all
evidence
is
fungible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
all
evidence
that's
capable
of
alteration
or
destruction
fungible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
child
is
old
enough
to
destroy
the
evidence
and
sees
what's
happening?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
the
police
go
in
and
make
the
child
come
out,
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
no,
the
child
is
inside,
and
the
officer
realizes,
well,
maybe
he'll
destroy
the
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
could
ask
him
to,
but
the
child
says
i'm
too
busy
destroying
evidence.
