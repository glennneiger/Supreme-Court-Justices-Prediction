justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
didn't
the
evidence
that
they
had
before
them
establish
at
least
exigent
circumstances?
could
they
have
gone
in
on
an
exigent
circumstances
exception?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
realize
that,
but
i
mean,
in
deciding
the
reasonableness
of
the...
of
blocking
the
individual
from
going
back
in,
it
seems
to
me
we
ought
to
consider
that
they
could
have
gone
in
themselves
under
an
exigent
circumstances
theory,
if
that
is
so.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
want
to
know
how
fine
you're
slicing
it
when
you
say
reasonable
cause
to
believe.
do
you
mean
probable
cause?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
you
don't
mean
probable
cause,
then
i
think
your
response
to
justice
ginsburg
is,
there
were
no
exigent
circumstances
sufficient
to
support
an
entry
but
for
the
police's
statement
to
him
that
they
knew
about
the
drugs
and
they
wanted
to
go
in.
am
i
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
now,
assume
they
did
not...
assume
we
remove
from
consideration
the
fact
that
they
told
him
that
the
wife
had
snitched
on
him
and
they
would
like
to
search.
did
they
have
probable
cause
to
make
an
exigent
circumstances
search?
justice
david
h.
souter
--of
course,
your
theory,
i
take
it,
is
that
he
could
have
been
arrested
in
the
house
without
a
warrant
because
the
indication
that
the
police
had
was
that
he
was
possessing
drugs
inside,
but
they
didn't
have
particularized
knowledge
that
the
amount
of
drugs
was
only...
only
carried
the
offense
to
the
misdemeanor
level,
so
i
take
it
you
would
have
said
he
could
have
gone...
they
could
have
gone
in
and
arrested
without
a
warrant.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
shouldn't...
given
the
fact
that
we
do
have...
we
do
make
a
distinction
between
arrest
with
or
without
warrant
in
one's
own
home,
why
shouldn't
the
police
have
the
burden
of
demonstrating
that
they
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
drugs
were
in
a
felony
quantity
before
they
went
in
to
arrest?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
right,
and
therefore
they
couldn't
have
gone
in.
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
administer,
it
would
be
easier
to
administer,
but
you'd
lose.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
effect
you're
saying
that
yes,
balancing
is
going
to
have
to
be
done
in
the
field,
so
i
think
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
is,
we
don't
have
just
a
simple
rule
that
if
there's
probable
cause
they
can
impound.
your
rule
is,
there's
a
general
rule
that
if
there's
probable
cause
they
can
impound,
but
there
may
be
circumstances
which
vary
the
permissible
application
of
that
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean,
they've
got
to
hear
the
sound
of
the
water
flushing,
or
something
like
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--before
they
can
go
in?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
why...
going
back
to
his
question,
why
wasn't
there
a
basis
for...
to
conclude
that
it
was
in
imminent
risk
of
destruction?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
your
particular...
well,
i'm
talking
about
justice
breyer's
hypo,
which
i
think
responded
to
your
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
assuming
we...
assuming
that
is
the
standard,
why
isn't
it
satisfied
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
gave,
which
i
think
is
descriptive
of
what
we
know
about
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you're
saying
that...
and
i'm
not
quite
sure
why,
but
you're
saying
we
know
for
a
fact
that
at
a
given
moment
he
had
not
taken
a
step
to
destroy
the
evidence,
but
the
hypothetical
is,
and
i
think
the
facts
of
the...
in
the
record
support
the
hypothetical,
that
the
wife
from
whom
he
is
estranged
and
who
has
an
obviously
rocky
relationship
with
him,
has
just
been
in
the
trailer,
has
seen
the
drugs,
is
now
outside
talking
to
police
officers.
isn't
a
person
of
any
intelligence
going
to
say,
she
is
very
likely
to
tell
them
what
she
saw,
i'd
better
get
rid
of
the
drugs?
the
question
is
not
whether
at
any
given
moment
he
had
actually
started
flushing
them
away.
the
question
is
whether
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
would
do
that,
and
why
isn't
there,
or
why
wasn't
there
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
she
had
come
out
and
said,
there
are
drugs
under
the
sofa,
after
having
been
in
the
trailer
extracting
personal
possessions.
isn't
it
reasonable
to
assume,
to
infer
that
she
had
seen
them?
she'd
just
been
there.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
so
your
claim
is
there
was
no
probable
cause.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
the
officer...
let
me
change
the
hypothetical
slightly
which
i
think
is...
in
a
way
that
i
think
is
also
supported
by
the
record.
consider
only
these
facts.
they...
the
police
are
outside
the
trailer.
they
are
in
plain
view,
so
it's
reasonable
to
suppose
that
he
inside
the
trailer,
he
knows
they're
there.
the
wife
goes
in.
the
wife
comes
out
and
says
to
the
police,
there's
marijuana
under
the
sofa.
he
sees
the
wife
talking
to
the
police.
don't
the
police
at
that
point
have
exigent
circumstances
to
believe
that
he
will
destroy
the
evidence?
justice
david
h.
souter
wouldn't
any
sensible
person
destroy
the
evidence?
i
mean,
wouldn't
he
reasonably
say,
she
has
just
been
in
here,
she
has
seen
the
drugs
under
the
sofa,
she's
talking
to
the
cops,
she
hates
my
guts,
she
is
probably
going
to
tell
the
cops
what
she
saw
in
here,
i'd
better
get
rid
of
it?
isn't
that
a
reasonable
thought
process
for
someone
in
his
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
you
can't
say
that.
what
makes
this
exigent
is
the
confluence
at
a
particular
point
in
time
in
which
the...
it
isn't
merely
a
case
in
which
he
has
drugs,
he
knows
somebody
knows
that
he
has
drugs,
he
knows
that
maybe
that
somebody
may
go
to
the
police.
it's
all
happening
in
front
of
him
at
that
time.
he
has
the
drugs,
the
person
who's
going
to
snitch
on
him
has
just
seen
the
drugs,
he
can
see
the
person
outside
his
trailer
talking
to
the
police.
it
is
sort
of
the
temporal
unity
of
all
of
this
that
gives
it
the
exigency,
and
why
doesn't...
that's
my
argument.
why
doesn't
it
give
a
sufficient
exigency?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you're
trying
to
answer
the
hypothetical
by
adding
facts
about
something
that
was
going
on
in
the
trailer
that
the
police
could
not
know,
and
if
the
police
didn't
know
it,
it
doesn't
get
into
the
analysis.
i
don't
see
how
it
affects
the
fact
that
they
could
infer
an
exigency.
i
guess
your
time
is
up.
