mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
for
three
reasons,
police
officers
who
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
residence
contains
incriminating
evidence
may
prevent
entry
for
a
reasonable
period
of
time
in
order
to
preserve
the
evidence
while
they
obtain
a
search
warrant.
first,
there's
a
strong
law
enforcement
interest
in
preserving
evidence
pending
issuance
of
a
warrant.
second,
securing
the
premises
from
the
outside
by
preventing
entry
is
a
limited
and
temporary
intrusion.
third,
it's
less
intrusive
than
other
means
of
preserving
evidence,
and
it
promotes
fidelity
to
the
fourth
amendment's
preference
that
searches
be
authorized
by
a
warrant.
when
a
residence
contains
evidence
of
a
crime,
there's
an
inherent
danger
that
the
evidence
may
be
damaged
or
destroyed
if
people
are
allowed
on
the
premises,
and
therefore,
unless
police
have
a
means
to
protect
the
evidence
during
the
time
that
it
takes
to
obtain
a
warrant,
the
search
pursuant
to
the
warrant
may
often
be
fruitless.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
all
evidence
is
not
fungible,
your
honor,
but
almost
all
evidence
is
capable
of
alteration
or
destruction,
or
damage
in
some
way.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no.
[laughter]
all
evidence
that's
capable
of
alteration
or
destruction
isn't
fungible
either,
but
there's
a
sufficient
inherent
danger
of
some
kind
of
damage
with...
damage
or
destruction
of
evidence
under
the
circumstances
that
the
risk
would
be
too
great
in
enough
cases
to
warrant
asking
for
some
particularized--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--certainly
not
when
all
we're
talking
about
is
temporarily
preventing
entry
for
a
limited
period
of
time.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
and--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--our
rule
that
we're
proposing
here
that
has
already
been
reflected
in
cases
involving
containers,
vehicles,
and
evidence
in
plain
view,
and
the
court
suggested
in
dicta
it
applies
to
securing
residences
as
well,
is
easily
applied.
the
issue
is,
is
there
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
residence
contains
evidence
of
a
crime,
and
if
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that,
then
there
is
a
consequent--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
the
court's
made
clear--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--the
court's
made
clear
that
any
search
or
seizure,
even
one
that's
justified
by
a
warrant,
can
be
rendered
unreasonable
by
the
manner
in
which
it's
executed,
and
one
factor
that
you
would
consider
in
determining
whether
the
seizure--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--no,
your
honor.
the
basic
principle
would
still
apply,
but
the
police
officers
have
to
act
reasonably.
that's,
the
fundamental
principle
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
reasonableness,
and
if
under
the
circumstances
reasonableness
required
some
accommodation
of
the
needs
that
were...
that
the
occupants
were
impeded
from
addressing
because
of
the
seizure,
the
police
would
have
to
reasonably
address
that.
if
there
was
a
child
inside,
i
think
that
would
create
exigent
circumstances
that
would
justify
them
going
in
to
take
care
of
the
child
if
there
were
some
need
to
do
that.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
there
may
be
circumstances
which
require
the
police
to
take
other
actions
to
address
the
needs
as
reasonable,
but
the
fundamental
rule
remains
the
same,
and
i
don't
think
that
is
different
than
in
any
other
circumstance,
any
other
kind
of--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i
think
that
if...
if...
unless
the
officer
had...
knew
that
there
wasn't
a
kid
in
there,
which
in
this
case
he
might
know
because
the
wife--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--he
could.
he
could
accompany
him
inside.
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
say
before,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
there
was
a
child
who
was...
who
needed
protection
that
much
that
required
the
respondent
to
enter,
then
that
would
justify
the
police
officer
going
in
in
the
interest
of
public
safety.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
if
the
child
were
outside
and
wanted
to
go
in
and
was
old
enough--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--oh,
the
officer
could
ask
the
child
to
come
out
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well
then,
that
would
certainly
create
exigent
circumstances
that
would
justify
going
in
to
secure
the
premises
from
the
inside,
but
this
case
involves
a
very
different
and
much
more
limited
situation,
where
all
that
was
necessary
was
to
prevent
entry
and
that
kind
of
intrusion
is
extremely
more
limited,
because
it's
only
possessory
interest
in
the
premises.
it
lasts
only
long
enough
to
get
the
judicial
determination
about
whether
there's
probable
cause
to
search
and
seize,
and
it's
far
less
intrusive
than
the
other
alternatives.
for
instance,
if
the
police
officers
here
had
arrested
respondent,
that
would
have
invaded
his
personal
privacy
and
his
liberty.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--the
legality
depends
on
the
presence
of
probable
cause.
i
think
at
the
time
that
they
conducted
the
seizure
they
would
have
had
probable
cause
and
the
seizure
would
be
legal.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
even
if
the
warrant
were
not
issued.
as
i
was
saying
before,
the...
part
of
the
reason
that
the
intrusion
is
so
small,
is
limited
here,
and
that
this
is
particularly
reasonable,
is
that
the
other
alternatives
such
as
arresting
the
occupants,
such
as
a
warrantless
entry,
are
more
intrusive,
involve
invasions
of
privacy.
they're
more
serious,
and
by
providing
an
alternative
to
immediate
warrantless
entry
this
external
impoundment
option
actually
encourages
police
officers
to
seek
a
warrant
before
they
search.
the
court
has
therefore
recognized
a
principle
that
the
interest
in
protecting
evidence
can
temporarily
supersede
possessory
interest
in
property
for
the
time
that
it
takes
to
get
a
warrant
in
a
variety
of
contexts.
as
i
noted
before,
the
court's
done
it
in
dictum
in
situations
involving
securing
premises,
but
the
court's
held
that
that's
true
in
a
variety
of
cases
like
container
cases,
where
the
court
has
held
that
if
the
police
have
probable
cause
to
believe
the
container
holds
evidence
they
can
seize
the
container
pending
a
warrant
to
search
it,
and
the
court's
held
that
if
the
police
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
evidence
that's
in
plain
view
is
associated
with
criminal
activity,
they
can
seize
it.
the
same
principle
that
underlies
that,
the
interest
in
protecting
the
evidence,
the
inherent
danger
that
the
evidence
may
be
damaged
or
destroyed
if
there
isn't
an
ability
to
freeze
the
status
quo
while
the
police
get
a
warrant,
the
fact
that
the
police
are
getting
the
warrant
here,
all
point
to
the
fact
that
it's
eminently
reasonable
for
the
police
to
be
able
to
secure
the
premises
from
the
outside
for
a
temporary
time
while
they
obtain
a
warrant
to
search.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
