justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bertocchi,
i
guess
your
case
is
easy
if
you
assume,
as
you
do,
that
they
had
authority
to
enter
without
a
warrant
on
the
basis
of
exigent
circumstances,
but
assuming
i
don't
agree
with
you
on
that
point,
i'm
concerned
about
complicating
the
criminal
law
more
than
is
necessary.
you're
asking
us
to
establish
some
standards
below
the
exigent
circumstances
standard
which
would
dispense
with
a
warrant,
and
you're
saying
if
you
don't
actually
go
into
the
house
we
want
yet
another
test
that's
a
little
bit
less
than
exigent
circumstances.
i'm
not
sure
that
human
beings
are
capable
of
entertaining
as
many
variations
and
figuring
out
what
is
less
than
exigent
circumstances
but
still
enough
to
justify
this.
why
shouldn't
we
just
have
one
single
rule?
it's
an
exigent
circumstances
rule.
if
there
are
exigent
circumstances,
you
can
either
go
in
the
house
or
exclude
the
homeowner
from
going
back
in
himself.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
not
a
balancing
test
with
exigent
circumstances.
if
there
are
exigent
circumstances
you
can
go
in.
you
don't
have
to
say,
you
know,
well,
is
it
a
really
expensive
house,
or
is
it
a
less
expensive
house,
or,
you
know,
is
this
person
really
concerned
with
his
privacy,
or
is
he
the
kind
of
guy
who
leaves
his
window
shades
up
anyway?
you
don't
balance
anything.
if
there
are
exigent
circumstances,
you
go
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
when
you
have
that
test
the
courts
know
how
to
deal
with
it.
why
don't
we
just
have
a
flat
rule,
if
there
are
exigent
circumstances,
you
can
either
go
in
or
you
can
stop
him
from
going
in?
justice
antonin
scalia
life
is
too
complicated.
we
can't
engage
in
all
of
these
myriad
levels
of
police
activity.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
that
the
wife
had
told
the
police
officers
not
that
he
had
hidden
some
contraband
under
the
sofa
but,
rather,
that
he
had
it
in
his
pocket.
are
we
going
to
have
to,
in
the
next
case,
ask
whether,
although
the
police
could
not
arrest
him
without
a
warrant
on
the
basis
of
just
that
probable
cause,
they
could
nonetheless
prevent
him
from
putting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
or,
you
know,
follow
him
around
and
make
sure
that
he
doesn't
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket,
which
is
a
lesser
intrusion
than
arresting
him,
arguably
a
lesser
intrusion
than
stopping
him...
i
mean,
is
there
any
end
to
the
number
of
variations
of
lesser,
lesser,
lesser
intrusion
that
we'll
be
confronted
with?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
roberts,
you
say
that,
you
know,
there's
a
great
law
enforcement
interest
in
preserving
the
evidence,
but
there's
also
a
considerable
interest
on
the
part
of
the
individual
in
going
into
his
own
home.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
he
tells
the
police
officer,
gee,
i
have
to
get
back
in
there,
i
have
something
on
the
stove
that's
going
to
burn.
or,
you
know,
i
have
a
child
in
there
that
i
have
to
attend
to.
now,
are
we
going
to
have
to
weigh
all
of
those
additional
factors
in
this
subtle
balancing
test
once
we
abandon
the
exigent
circumstances
rule
and
ask
in
each
case,
well,
this
isn't
just
getting
back
into
his
home,
it's
getting
back
into
his
home
to
turn
off
his
computer,
or
to
take
care
of
a
child.
we're
going
to
go
crazy
trying
to
balance
these
things
all
the
time.
why
not
just
stick
with
the
exigent
circumstances
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
there's
a
child
in
there
that
needs
taking
care
of,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
clear
rule,
then.
you're
going
to
take
that
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
not
a
manner
of
executing
it.
they're
executing
it
by
not
letting
him
go
into
the
house,
but
you're
saying
it
isn't
just
the
house
you
have
to
consider,
it's
also
all
these
other
factors,
why
he
wants
to
go
in,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
rule
would
depend
on
the
facts
as
they
are
known
to
the
officer,
even...
so
that
so
long
as
the
homeowner
says,
i
have
a
kid
in
there,
even
if
he
doesn't
have
a
kid
in
there,
it
would
be
unreasonable
for
the
police
officer
to
stop
him
from
going
in,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
could
i
come
to
the
question
presented
here,
which...
i
had
thought,
frankly,
that
the
question
presented
posed
neither
the
issue
of
exigent
circumstances,
nor
the
issue
of
probable
cause.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
this
is
not
a
hard
case
if
there
were
exigent
circumstances.
if
you...
if
the
police
officer...
you
would
acknowledge,
i
think,
that
if
he
could
have
gone
into
the
house,
he
could
do
the
lesser
thing
of
stopping
your
client
from
going
into
the
house.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
mean,
there's
no
reason
to
take
this
case
if
there
were
exigent
circumstances.
and
as
for
probable
cause,
the
way
i
read
the
question
presented,
is
it
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment
for
police
officers
who
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
residence
contains
evidence
that
could
readily
be
destroyed,
to
secure
the
residence
by
preventing
its
occupant
and
others
from
entering
unaccompanied.
i
thought
that...
you're
not
conceding
the
existence
of
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
residence
contained
evidence
that
could
readily
be
destroyed?
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
talking
about
your
brief
in
opposition
to
the
petition,
not
the
brief
in
opposition
on
the
merits,
and
you
do
say
on
page
7
of
your
brief
in
opposition
to
the
petition,
and
that's
the
basis
on
which
we
decide
whether
or
not
to
accept
these
petitions,
what
is
the
issue
presented.
we
don't...
we
wouldn't
have
taken
this
case
to
decide
whether
in...
on
these
particular
facts
there
was
probable
cause
or
not.
that's
not
the
kind
of
thing
we
normally
do
here.
but
you
had
said
in
your
opposition,
although
probable
cause
existed,
and
the
police
entry
was
made
peaceably.
you're
obviously
talking
about
before
the
warrant
was
issued,
and
i
took
that
to
mean
accepting
the
question
presented,
is
it
reasonable
for
police
officers
who
have
probable
cause
to
believe.
if
you
were
going
to
contest
that,
you
should
have
made
that
clear
when
you
opposed
the
petition.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bertocchi,
i
would
not
normally
intrude
upon
your
time,
but
you
know,
i've
just
criticized
or
discussed
with
ms.
jones
whether
she
wasn't
altering
the
question
presented.
i
have
the
same
question
for
you.
i
had
frankly
thought
that
this
case
involved
neither
the
question
about
whether
there
was
probable
cause,
nor
the
question
about
whether
there
were
exigent
circumstances.
if
there
were
exigent
circumstances
so
the
policeman
could
have
gone
in,
this
is
an
easy
case.
but
you
come
up
and
argue
exigent
circumstances.
it
was
not
argued
in
your
petition
for
certiorari.
it
was
not
contained
in
the
question
presented
for
review
in
your
petition
for
certiorari,
which
is,
by
the
way,
different
from
the
question
that
you
show
in
your
blue
brief.
what
are
we
talking
about
here?
all
of
a
sudden
i'm
discussing
a
case
that
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
case
that
i
thought
we
were
going
to
hear.
