but
then
you
run
up
against
your
opponent's
argument
that
the
police
themselves
created
the
exigent
circumstances,
because
they
told...
they
told
the,
later,
defendant
that
his
wife
had
snitched
on
him,
and
if
he
didn't
know
that,
then
he
wouldn't
have
any
incentive.

--did
she
indicate
how
much
marijuana,
because
much
is
made
by
mcarthur
that
this
was...
this
is
very
small
stakes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
police
had
no
way
of
knowing
the
quantity
at
that
point.
i
think
you
just
told
us,
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
that
if
the
crime
would
be
a
felony,
then
what
was
done
here
was
okay.
secure
the
premises
pending
receipt
of
a
warrant
by
the
police
officer.
but
if
the
crime
is
only
a
misdemeanor,
then,
too
bad,
you
have
to
take
the
risk
that
the
evidence
will
be
destroyed.
i
think
that's
the
line
you're
drawing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
is
it
exigent
circumstances
if
it's
a
felony
but
not
if
it's
a
misdemeanor?
that's
what
i
don't
fathom,
because
i
thought
from
your
brief
and
from
what
you
said
before
that
you
were
making
a
distinction
between
lesser
offenses
and
felonies.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
are
they
not
taking
it
seriously?
they
immediately
go
off
to
get
a
warrant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
had
conceded
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
get
the
warrant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
stop
you
at
that
point,
because
i
think
you're
telling
the
police,
don't
be
candid
with
the
people
who
you
suspect
about
what's
going
on.
it
seems
to
me
here
the
officers
did
everything
by
the
book.
they
asked
him
whether
he
had
contraband.
when
he
said
no
they
said,
we're
going
off
to
get
a
warrant,
and
it
seems
what
you're
saying
right
now
is
that
the
police
would
have
been
in
a
better
position
vis
a
vis
the
fourth
amendment
if
they
had
not
told
him
what's
up.
