mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
because
something
in
this
case
does
appear
to
turn
on
whether
merely
rationality
review
is
appropriate
or
whether
one
needs
something
more
important,
we
would
suggest
very
much
more
important
since
we
do
think
this
is
a
free
speech
case,
i
wanted
to
begin
with
justice
scalia's
question,
is
there
anything
that
congress
does
that
is
not
important.
i
think
it's
a
question,
however
couched,
that
one
really
has
to
address
in
the
context
of
these
programs
because,
as
the
solicitor
general
mentioned,
there
are
a
dozen
programs
in
which
congress
has
essentially
provided
for
the
government
to
mandate
that
growers
and
producers
pay
for
advertisement
and
then
although
there
is
some
other
informational
stuff,
that's
the
core
of
it,
and
in
this
case,
as
we
point
out
in
footnote
7
of
our
brief,
it's
98
percent
of
it.
these
other
programs
are
really
quite
haphazard.
they
cover
blueberries
but
not
raspberries.
they
don't
cover
strawberries.
they
cover
avocados,
not
artichokes.
they
cover
popcorn.
at
1996
congress
found
specifically
that
popcorn
has
all
of
the
characteristics
of
mushrooms
vital
to
the
economy,
and
indeed
it
was
in
1996
determined
by
congress
that
canola
is
even
more
important
to
the
survival
of
the
economy
and
yet
no
canola
program
was
put
in
place,
and
maybe
that
explains
why
problems
are
occurring.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
not
at
all,
but
in
wileman
you
had
an
economic
regulation
essentially,
and
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
greater
new
orleans
case,
the
various
haphazard
features
of
the
commercial
regulation
there,
of
commercial
speech
might
have
been
constitutionally
tolerable
if
congress
had
undertaken
substantively
to
regulate
the
gambling
industry.
that's
a
very
fundamental
difference.
of
course,
one
finds
a
crazy
quilt
pattern
and
one
doesn't
inspect
congress'
findings
when
merely
rationality
is
involved,
but
if
we
are
to
accept
the
government's
theory,
and
i
want
to
turn
to
government
speech
in
a
moment,
if
we're
to
accept
the
government's
theory
that
whenever
there
is
an
interest,
not
a
program,
not
a
regulatory
regime,
nothing
like
collective
bargaining
or
a
labor
union
with
an
integrated
set
of
obligations
or
an
integrated
bar,
as
in
the
keller
case,
but
just
an
interest,
like
the
interest
in
not
having
kids
waste
too
much
money
on
designer
clothes.
whenever
you
can
posit
an
interest
in
the
air
and
then
you
can
find
speech
that
would
advance
that
interest,
that's
all
you
need.
now,
that
would
be
an
astonishing
principle.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
sure.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i'm
not.
i
do
believe
that
the
court
would
have
to
break
new
ground,
perhaps
along
the
line
justice
kennedy
has
suggested
if
there
were
government
speech.
in
your
questions,
justice
breyer,
you
said
we,
we.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
who
is
the
we
in
your
question?
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
i
really
should
turn
to
whether
this
is
speech
for
which
the
government
bears
responsibility
because
it
seems
to
me
that
in
all
of
your
cases,
whether
the
ultimate
vehicle
for
the
speech
is
the
tobacco
council
or
the
government,
it's
the
government's
message.
it's
quite
different
to
say
that
we're
going
to
take
money
from
private
enterprise,
private
individuals,
we're
going
to
give
it
to
other
private
individuals
so
that
they
can
compose
a
message,
like
a
message
that
brands
don't
make
any
difference,
if
you've
seen
one
mushroom,
you've
seen
them
all,
a
message
which
is
very
much
opposed
to
the
interest
of
those
who
are
forced
to
pay.
now,
if
this
were
government
speech,
where
government
is
accountable
to
the
people,
a
principle
like
justice
kennedy,
saying
that
as
long
as
the
beneficiaries
are
the
ones
who
are
taxed
might
suffice,
but
let
me
turn
to
whether
it's
government
speech
because
i
think
when
we
get
back
to
the
question
of
whether
it
can
survive
on
any
other
theory,
it
will
be
fairly
clear
that
it
cannot.
now,
i'm
not
going
to
spend
time
on
whether
this
issue
is
properly
before
the
court,
except
to
say
that
it's
not
just
a
technicality,
it's
not
simply
that
the
matter
was
not
raised
or
addressed
below,
and--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--oh,
i
understand
their
reasons
for
doing
it.
i
just
wanted
to
say
what
reasons
the
court
might
have
for
not
letting
them
do
it.
and
that
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
face
of
this
law,
as
i'll
explain
in
a
moment,
it's
not
government
speech.
to
show
that
it
was,
they
would
have
to
adduce
some
facts,
as
in
brentwood.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i'm
not
saying
the
court
lacks
jurisdiction,
but
i'm
saying
in
order
to
establish
that
the
government
is
really
responsible
for
these
messages,
despite
the
fact
that
under
the
regulations
and
the
statute,
the
secretary
cannot,
in
fact,
reject
a
message
for
any
reason
other
than
that
the
program
established
by
the
mushroom
council,
it
violates
the
statute,
or
that
the
message
derogates
another
individual's
product.
the
message
is
composed
by
these
private
individuals
in
the
mushroom
council.
the
members
of
the
mushroom
council
are
selected
by
nomination
from
the
private
industry.
the
government
is
simply
saying,
promote
mushrooms.
now,
if
that
is
government
speech,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
a
case
like,
oh,
for
example,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
amtrak
case
where
they
rely
heavily
on
lebron,
in
amtrak
where
this
court
did
hold
that
for
purposes
of
making
first
amendment
arguments
against
amtrak,
it
is
an
instrumentality
of
the
government,
but
the
artist
who
wanted
to
put
something
on
that
huge
billboard
in
amtrak's
penn
station
was
not
going
to
be
propagating
a
government
message
simply
because
the
government
was
providing
the
facility.
the
question
of
whether
you
can
make
a
first
amendment
argument
against
an
entity
whether
it's
sufficiently
the
government
for
that
purpose,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
of
whether
it
is
government
speech
when
that
entity,
as
in
the
case
of
the
mushroom
council,
uses
its
private
capacity
to
propagate
messages
in
its
private
interests.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
he
could
under
the
statute,
only
if
the
message
is
not
consistent
with
the
statute.
if
he
does
not
have
general
censorial
powers,
he's
not
an
editor
under
this
statute.
so
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--he
has
the
ultimate
power
to
approve
the
whole
program.
the
program
is
approved
by
him.
but
he
does
not
have
authority
to
disapprove
a
campaign
of
advertising
under
the
program
on
the
ground
that
he
doesn't
like
what
it
says.
he
has
never
exercised
such
authority,
the
regulations
don't--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
in
the
guidelines
of
the
department
of
agriculture
itself
for
oversight
of
commodity
research,
on
page
49
of
our
brief,
the
description
is
that
the
agricultural
marketing
service
only
reviews
materials
to
ensure
that
they
are
in
compliance
with
the
applicable
legislative
authority.
i
don't
know
if
one
could
construe
this
statute
to
make
the
secretary
of
agriculture
assume
a
purely
editorial
capacity,
i
rather
doubt
it,
but
clearly
no
such
construction
has
been
suggested
by
the
agency
that
administers
the
statute.
i
think
the
idea
that
the
mushroom
council
is
somehow
the
voice
of
america
is
not
plausible.
it's
not
plausible
because
this
is
not
a
message
that
the
government
has
in
any
way
organized
or
composed,
and
if
one
did
take
that
view--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the
fact
that
it
is
permitted
by
government
does
not
mean
that
it
is
government's
voice.
a
great
deal
is
permitted
by
the
government.
if
it
is
required,
if
the
exact
words
are
required,
the
words
on
a
cigarette
package,
the
surgeon
general
has
determined
that
this
is
detrimental
to
your
health.
that's
government
speech.
but
if
we
say
this
is
government
speech,
then
much
of
what
this
court
was
struggling
with,
in
cases
like
keller
and
lehnert,
the
speech
of
a
state
bar
association,
an
integrated
bar,
which
the
chief
justice
in
his
opinion
for
a
unanimous
court
pointed
out
the
integrated
bar
for
some
purposes
might
be
the
government,
but
the
expressive
activities
in
which
it
engages,
even
if
they
are
germane
to
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining,
that
is,
even
if
they
are
related
to
the
process
of
exclusive
representation
and
therefore
squarely
within
the
ambit
of
what
the
government
has
authorized
the
entity
to
do
in
the
case
of
a
labor
union,
and
even
if
they
are
part
of
the
process
of
regulating
the
legal
profession
or
improving
legal
service,
it
doesn't
make
it
government
speech.
in
fact,
the
magic
wand
of
government
speech
would
obliterate
a
great
deal
of
the
doctrine
this
court
has
carefully
built.
i
do
think
it's
worth
looking
at
the
reasons.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
if
you
had
a
comparable.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
taxing
the
consumer
of
a
product--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
don't
care
if
it's
a
tax.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
okay.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
to
make
it
the
same...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt.
to
make
it
the
same,
justice
breyer,
you
would
have
to
have
a
group
of
museums,
some
of
them
believing
that
all
museums
are
the
same,
and
you
don't
have
to
have
anything
fancy
in
the
museum,
it
doesn't
really
matter
if
you
have
any
jackson
pollack,
you
just
put
stuff
up,
and
other
museums
that
specialize,
and
they
have
brands.
and
now
the
government
comes
along
and
says,
all
of
you
are
free
to
say
what
you
want
about
whether
you
will
have
picasso
there
or
jackson
pollack.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think
the
users--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
see
the
problem,
but
the
quicksand
that
you're
describing,
i
think,
one
can
avoid
to
some
extent
by
saying
that
the
government
does
not
have
the
power
without
complying
with
a
very
stringent
first
amendment
requirement
to
make
people
speak,
either
speak
directly
or
contribute
to
someone
else
who
then
propagates
a
message
in
effect
in
their
name.
it's
true
that
when
i
buy
a
product,
the
price
may
include
the
advertising
costs.
i
buy
pictsweet
mushrooms
and
it...
but
if
we
say
the
government
can
make
the
people
who
sell
clothes
say
that
it's
not
very
good
to
buy
designer
clothes,
then
we
are
lost.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
general,
what
i
would
like
to
see,
but
the
court
has
really
not
struggled
with
problems
in
this
precise
area,
i
would
like
to
see
a
principle
that
says
that
government
speech,
when
the
government
takes
responsibility
for
it,
and
assumes
the
shield
from
first
amendment
scrutiny
must
be
funded
from
general
revenue.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
that's
right,
justice
scalia.
that
is,
apart
from
the
portion
of
your
statement
that
said
we're
indifferent
about
mushrooms,
which
doesn't
reflect
my
present
state
of
mind,
apart
from
that,
i
think
that
it
should
not
be
permissible
for
the
government
to
make
people
propagate
messages.
how
can
it
possibly
make
a
difference
whether
we
are
told,
you'd
better
hire
an
agency
next
year
and
spend
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
advocate
the
following
view,
either
that
mushrooms
are
not
so
good
for
you
or
that
mushrooms
are
great
or
that
mushrooms
make
you
want
to
smoke
and
therefore
they're
not
good
for
you.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
the
principle
that
sometimes
what
you
don't
say
is
as
important
as
what
you
do
explains
why
in
cases
like
zouderer
and
debonyez
the
court
has
stopped
short
of
saying
that
the
government
may
never
fill
in
the
gaps
in
someone's
commercial.
that
is,
if
one
is
selling
cigarettes
and
not
mentioning
that,
by
the
way,
they
may
kill
you,
perhaps
the
government
has
the
power,
it's
been
assumed
that
it
does,
to
say
you
better
add
that
to
your
message,
but
this
is
not
a
case
where
there
is
a
gap
in
speech
that's
being
filled
by
the
government
to
protect
consumers.
here
the
government
says
we
want
essentially
to
manipulate
consumer
preference.
it's
exactly
like
liquormart
except
a
mirror
image.
in
liquormart
this
court
essentially
said,
if
you,
i
think,
combine
the
opinions
i
think
this
court
said,
that
if
your
purpose
is
to
affect
consumption,
in
that
case
of
liquor,
by
affecting
price,
and
to
affect
price
by,
in
that
case,
wording
competition
because
competition
might
drive
price
down
and
drive
consumption
up.
then
you
at
least
have
to
satisfy
central
hudson,
you
would
at
least--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--justice
ginsburg,
in
riley
and
in
hurley,
this
court
said
it's
not
very
different.
forcing
you
to
say
x
is
not
different
from
preventing
you
from
saying
y,
and
that's
why
the
example
i
just--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--a
corporation
never
can
say
anything,
all
it
can
ever
do
is
pay
money.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
understand,
justice
stevens,
and
i
think
technically...
well,
that's
why
i
gave
the
example
of
go
and
hire
an
ad
agency.
if
the
only
thing
that
riley
and
hurley
prevent
is
having
the
government
actually
say
to
you,
you
must
use
your
own
employees
to
get
out
the
following
message,
then
it
would
follow
that
they
could
require
us,
just
as
they
can
require
us
to
put
money
in
the
kitty
of
the
mushroom
council
so
that
they
can
speak
for
us,
they
could
require
to
us
go
out
and
hire
an
ad
agency
and
put
out
a
certain
kind
of
message
and
spend
a
hundred
thousand
a
year
because
they
wouldn't
be
buttoning
our
lip.
and
by
the
way,
the
message
better
be,
all
mushrooms
are
great.
it
seems
to
me
if
we've
had
to
hire
an
ad
agency,
no
one
here
would
doubt
that
that
violated
the
first
amendment,
to
require
us
to
do
it,
and
yet
that
would
be
better
for
us
than
having
to
rely
on
the
mushroom
council.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
believe
it
can.
the
government
can--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it
can
be
selective.
the
government
can...
viewpoint
based
in
its
speech.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
the
moment
you
start
targeting
people
to
pay
for
speech,
a
certain
subgroup,
there
is
a
first
amendment
problem.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
to
protect
consumers.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
justice
breyer,
i
think
there
is
a
common
theme
that's
very
important,
and
that
is,
regulation
designed
to
eliminate
impediments
to
fair
bargaining
may
sometimes
involve
an
informational
component.
certain
kinds
of
deception
interfere
with
the
ability
of
people
to
operate
in
the
marketplace
of
ideas
and
goods
and
services.
it's
on
that
theory
that
the
commercial
speech
doctrine
can
make
some
sense,
and
as
suggested
in
a
number
of
this
court's
opinions
that
i
think
may
converge
to
that
view,
whenever
you
try
to
manipulate
preferences
rather
than
enabling
people
to
express
them,
you
are
essentially
playing
a
big
brother
role
with
information.
that's
why
there's
a
fundamental
difference
in
principle
between
saying,
in
this
case
you
better
add
a
certain
warning
or
you
will
be
fundamentally
fooling
the
person
on
the
other
side
of
the
bargaining
table--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--and
saying
you
better
say
the
following
kind
of
thing
because
it's
important
to
us
that
you
say
it.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
wouldn't
minimize
the
importance
of
the
slippery
slope,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
the
advertisement
of
the
fact,
the
mere
fact
that
you've
been
inspected
by
the
government
is
anything
more
than
requiring
you
to
be
a
vehicle
for
government
speech,
and
cases
like
wooley
v.
maynard
supposedly
limit
that.
they
limit
it
on
the
ground
that
if
the
message
is
ideological,
you
shouldn't
be
forced
to
do
it.
but
there's
the
slippery
slope.
where
does
ideology
end?
ethical
treatment
of
mushrooms.
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
far
safer
in
terms
of
protecting
people
from
either
having
the
government
button
their
lip
or
having
the
government
force
them
to
speak,
to
limit
the
government's
power
with
respect
to
mandating
speech
or
mandating
the
funding
of
speech
to
cases
where
the
government
can
show
not
just
any
old
general
important
interest
because
that's
unlimited,
but
show
that
the
transactions
involved
are
going
to
be
significantly
distorted
by
either
misinformation
or
by
overbearing
unless
a
certain
message
is
included.
the
moment
you
go
beyond
that,
it
seems
to
me,
the
moment
you
take
advantage
of
that
branch
of
the
central
hudson
test
which
allows
the
government
effectively
to
control
speech
in
order
to
manipulate
preferences
because
it's
in
the
public
interest,
you've
abandoned
the
premise
of
virginia
board
of
pharmacy
and
of
the
whole
line
of
cases
that
follow
it.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
so,
but
i
do
want
to
remind
the
court
that
the
issue
here
is
principally
whether
this
program
can
escape
scrutiny
under
the
first
amendment,
not
whether
it
is
bad
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
right,
i
have
no
problem
with
the
thing
on
the
package--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--but
making
the
industry
fund
a
campaign.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no
problem
at
all.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
look
out
for
the
blue
mushroom,
that's
right.
no
problem
whatever.
whether
this
program
should
be
subject
to
first
amendment
scrutiny
other
than
on
the
government
speech
theory,
which
as
i
tried
to
explain,
i
think,
does
not
work,
depends,
i
think,
on
whether
it
is
ancillary
to
something,
that
is,
it's
not
a
question
of
exactly
what
all
the
bells
and
whistles
look
like
in
the
regulatory
program
for
nectarines
and
peaches.
it
was
clear,
as
this
court
repeatedly
emphasized,
including
in
the
section
of
the
opinion
explaining
why
the
central
hudson
framework
didn't
fit,
it
was
clear
that
the
fundamental
structure
of
the
program
was
to
replace
individual
choice
and
competition
with
collectivization,
and
when
you
do
that,
the
premises
of
central
hudson
don't
work,
and
when
you
collectivize,
among
other
things,
people
don't
necessarily
have
much
incentive
to
say
things
that
will
have
positive
spillover
effects
for
other
people's
products.
there's
a
kind
of
advertisement
gap
which
perhaps
the
government
could
fill
the
way
it
did
in
wileman.
it's
a
close
question.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
uh
huh.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
must
say
i
read
the
in
any
event
phrase,
which
is
pivotal
here.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
from
the...
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
know.
i
read
it
less
literally.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
right.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
all
one
really
has
to
ask
is
whether
it
would
be
conceivable
to
have
a
rule
that
says
as
long
as
it's
not
ideological,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
germane
to
anything,
you
can
make
people
speak
about
it,
so
we
could
make
the
mushroom
people
distribute
copies
of
weather
reports
to
everyone
in
the
country.
you
might
come
up
with
a
rationalization
for
that.
if
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
but
for
one
thing
you
can
have
a
serious
antitrust
conspiracy
simply
because
of
minimum
quality
agreements.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
it
really
went
beyond
that.
also,
there
were
size
restrictions
on
the
fruit.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
nectarine.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
exactly,
exactly.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
clearly
they
were
immune,
for
example,
from
the
antitrust
laws.
this
was
now
collectivized,
and
so
all
the
talk
about
the
free
market
of
information
which
underlies
and
undergirds
virginia
board
didn't
apply.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
that's
always
present.
that
is,
if
you
want
to...
germane
in
liquormart
to
having
people
consume
less
liquor,
i
mean,
that
will
never
do.
it
seems
to
me
the
moment
you
kick
the
prop
out
from
under
this
it's
simply
a
free
floating
mandate
to
fund
speech,
and
it
seems
to
me
as
such
it
can't
possibly
be
sustained.
and
i
do
think
that
even
the
word
germane
is
awfully
slippery,
as
is
the
word
ideology.
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
look
at,
for
example,
what
keller
said
about
the
ellis
case,
it's
really
required
in
the
whole
abood
line
of
cases
that
something
be
reasonably
necessary
as
an
expense
incurred
to
make
the
nonspeech
program
of
collective
bargaining
or
of
professional
regulation
work.
this
is
not
reasonably
necessary
to
make
anything
work
except
itself,
and
indeed
one
of
their
amici
representing
beef
and
milk
and
eggs
i
think
said
it
quite
bluntly
i
think
on
page
6
of
the
amicus
brief.
they
said
this
speech
is
germane
to
itself.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
seems
to
me
that
tautology
is
everybody's
friend
except
the
friend
of
the
first
amendment,
and
i
think
with
that
i
would
close.
