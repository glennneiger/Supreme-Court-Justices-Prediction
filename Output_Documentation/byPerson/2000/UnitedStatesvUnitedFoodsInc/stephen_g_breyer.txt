justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
it
matter
if
they
have
an
ideological
objection?
i
noticed
in
their
brief
they
said
they
objected
to
the
association
of
mushrooms
with
alcohol,
for
example.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
it
astonishing?
suppose
the
government
were
to
say
museum
goers
pay
an
extra
ten
cents
on
a
ticket
so
that
we
then
can
advertise
to
the
inner
city
the
presence
of
museums.
suppose
that
you
had
tobacco,
and
they
said
we
want
to
charge
50
cents
more
a
cigarette
pack
so
that
we
can
advertise
that
cigarettes
are
bad
for
you?
all
right,
i
mean,
you
can
think
of--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--lots
of
things
that
are
not
the
slightest
bit
absurd.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you're
saying
that
all
those
things
are
unconstitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
there
isn't.
in
my
questions
there
is
no
government
speech.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
we
is
that
they
have
the
museum
council,
and
the
museum
council
is
told
by
statute
to
collect
ten
cents
on
each
ticket
to
advertise
museums
in
the
inner
city
or
we
have
the
tobacco
council,
and
the
tobacco
council
is
told
to
collect
50
cents
a
pack
to
advertise
that
tobacco
smoking
is
bad
for
you.
now,
i'd
want
to
know...
all
those
things
seem
identical
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
it
be
government
speech,
though,
with
the
museums?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
what
they're
doing
is
a
tax,
museums,
they're
private
organizations.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no.
what
happens,
they
raise
it
the
same
way.
i
just
want
to
make
it
the
same.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
make
it
the
same.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
the
museums
are
going
to
advertise
throughout
the
city
the
arts.
they
are
going
to
say
come
to
the
museums,
the
arts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
could
happen.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--even
the...
see,
the
problem
is
you
go
in,
what
the
actual
problem
it
seems
to
me,
and
through
tobacco,
is
to
start
making
these
distinctions.
i
don't
know
what
kinds
of
lines
we're
going
to
have
to
draw.
does
the
fact
that
it's
a
tobacco,
antismoking
message
make
the
difference,
all
other
things
being
the
same?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course
you
think
of
the
securities
area
where
it's
among
municipal
bonds,
as
soon
as
you
get
into
that
it's
a
common
thing
for
a
government
to
require
people
to
take
certain
newspaper
ads,
to
have
certain
kinds
of
prospectuses.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
ah
yes,
all
right.
now,
just
for
reasons
that
are
good
reasons.
i
mean,
this
may
be
quite
basic,
and
the
cases
may
just
not
permit
me
to
ask
this
question,
but
i
just
wonder
why
it
is
that
advertising
here
you're
going
to
treat
differently
from
solicitation
to
buy
stocks
from
any
one
of
thousands
and
thousands
of
business
activities
carried
on,
as
all
business
is,
through
speech
acts
which
are
subject
to
wide
varieties
of
regulations,
subsidy,
dozens
of
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wasn't
it
true
that
in
the
wileman
that
the
object...
it
wasn't
cartelization,
there
weren't
price
or
production
regulations,
there
were
simply
regulations
as
to
product
quality.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
that's
true.
