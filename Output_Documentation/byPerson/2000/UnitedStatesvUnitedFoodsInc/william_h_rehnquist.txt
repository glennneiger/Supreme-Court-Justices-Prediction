chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
on
no.
00-276,
the
united
states
and
the
department
of
agriculture
v.
united
foods,
inc.--
ms.
mcdowell.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
answer
the
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
our
old
butler
case
you
know,
in
1936,
where
there
was
a
tax
on
processors
that
the
court
held
was
unconstitutional
because
it
was
misdirected.
now,
then
the
case
may
not
be
good
law
anymore,
but
certainly
you've
got
some
problem
with
a
tax
which
is
imposed
on
some
people
but
benefits
a
lot
of
other
people.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
treat
this
as
simply
a
tax
thing,
a
tax
scheme,
that's
probably
our
most
lenient
standard
of
review,
but
you
have
the
commercial
speech
cases
which
talk
about
an
intermediate
level
of
scrutiny
well
above
even
ordinary
rational
basis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
that
argument's
rejected
in
buckley--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
argument
you
just
made,
that
the
government
is
paying
to
have
more
speech
was
exactly
the
argument
we
reject
in
buckley
where
the
campaign
finance
rule
that
we
struck
down
said,
you
know,
we
need
to
hear
from
more
people,
not
less,
and
so
we're
going
to
restrict
some
people's
speech,
and
the
courts
refused
to
go
along
with
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
a
mushroom
caucus
in
congress,
isn't
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
mcdowell.
mr.
tribe,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
to
what
extent
do
you
have
to,
you
know,
if
you
lose
a
case
in
the
court
of
appeals,
your
common
sense
tells
you
have
a
little
bit
different
emphasis
in
the
supreme
court,
maybe
you'll
win.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we're
talking
about
the
first
amendment.
this
is
just
one
strand
as
opposed
to
another
strand
of
first
amendment
arguments.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tribe.
ms.
mcdowell,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
mcdowell,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
united
states
versus
united
foods,
no.
00-276.
four
terms
ago
in
glickman
v.
wileman
brothers,
we
rejected
a
first
amendment
challenge
of
the
constitutionality
of
a
series
of
agricultural
marketing
orders.
as
part
of
a
larger
regulatory
marketing
scheme,
those
orders
required
producers
of
certain
california
tree
fruits
to
pay
assessments
for
product
advertising.
in
the
case
now
before
us,
a
federal
statue
mandates
assessments
on
the
handlers
of
fresh
mushrooms
for
product
advertising.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
found
the
mandated
payments
were
not
part
of
a
more
comprehensive
statutory
program
for
marketing,
and
it
held
the
assessments
were
invalid
under
the
first
amendment.
we
granted
certiorari
and
in
an
opinion
for
the
court
authored
by
justice
kennedy
we
affirm.
we
have
used
standards
for
determining
the
validity
of
speech
regulations,
which
accord
less
protection
to
commercial
speech
than
to
other
expression.
even
when
we
to
view
commercial
speech
as
entitled
to
some
lesser
of
protection,
we
find
no
basis
in
either
glickman
or
under
our
first
amendment
precedents
to
sustain
the
compelled
assessment
sought
in
this
case.
first
amendment
values
are
at
serious
risk
if
the
government
can
compel
a
particular
citizen
or
a
discrete
group
of
citizens
to
pay
subsidies
for
speech
on
the
side
that
it
favors,
and
there
is
no
apparent
principle,
which
would
accept
minor
debates
such
as
those
about
mushrooms
in
this
case,
from
that
general
principle.
the
program
sustained
in
glickman
differs
from
the
one
under
review
in
a
fundamental
aspect.
in
glickman
the
mandated
assessments
for
speech
were
ancillary
to
a
more
comprehensive
program
restricting
market
autonomy.
here,
for
all
practical
purposes,
the
advertising
itself,
far
from
being
ancillary,
is
the
principle
object
of
the
regulatory
scheme.
mushroom
producers
are
not
forced
to
associate
as
a
group,
which
makes
cooperative
decisions.
a
proper
application
of
the
rule
in
abood
v.
detroit
board
of
education,
a
long
standing
precedent
of
this
court,
requires
us
to
invalidate
the
instant
statutory
scheme.
under
abood
only
an
overriding
associational
purpose
allows
any
compelled
subsidy
for
speech.
here
the
only
program
the
government
contends
the
compelled
contributions
serve
is
the
very
advertising
scheme
in
question.
were
it
sufficient
to
say
speech
is
germane
to
itself,
the
limits
observed
in
the
abood
line
of
cases
would
be
empty
of
meaning
in
significance.
so,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justices
stevens
and
thomas
have
filed
concurring
opinions;
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
ginsburg
joins,
and
in
which
justice
oâ€™connor
joins
as
to
parts
1
and
3.
