justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
take
it
it's
your
position
that
if
it
were
solely
confined
to
advertising,
it
would
be
constitutional
nonetheless.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
this
commercial
speech
that
is
within
the
first
amendment
for
some
purposes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
your
position
is
that
in
some
instances
industries
or
persons
can
be
compelled
to
contribute
to
commercial
speech
when
there
is
no
other
program
that's
connected
with
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
line
gets
back
to
ideology
again,
and
i
do
want
you
to
address
the
government
speech
argument
justice
o'connor...
let
me,
just
one
hypothetical.
suppose
that
the
government
decides
that
kids
are
spending
too
much
money
on
designer
clothes,
and
they
want
them
to
buy
generic
clothes,
and
because
they're
causing
jealousy
in
the
high
schools
and
all
that
stuff,
so
the
government
has
a
huge
advertising
campaign,
buy
generic
clothes,
but
assesses
all
the
clothing
manufacturers,
including
the
designers,
is
that
ideological?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
controlling
consumer
tastes,
demands,
attitudes.
this
it
seems
to
me,
is
something
that
our
culture,
rightly
or
wrongly,
is
very
interested
in,
and
you're
saying
that
the
government
can
compel
people
that
don't
believe
in
that
particular
approach
to
contribute
to
shaping
social
attitudes
about
it
through
speech?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
so
now
you
have
to
have
some
special
government
interest?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now
you
have
to
have
some
special
government
interest,
some
compelling
interest
that
the
government
is
accomplishing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
it
would
be
a
stable
or
a
workable
line,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
there's
not
much
we
can
do
about
government
speech,
but
maybe
at
least
we
can
say
it
has
to
be
funded
by
general
revenues
and
not
from
a
targeted
group
that
objects
to
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
anything--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
do
we
need
an
important
purpose
other
than
just
to
solve
rational
basis,
in
which
case
is
any
old
purpose?
is
it
important
because
speech
is
involved?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what's
the
case
or
the
rule
or
the
line
of
doctrine
that
says
speech
interests
can
be
abridged
because
there's
an
important,
as
opposed
to
simply
a
rational,
government
interest?
that
sounds
to
me
like
a
new
line
of
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
then
why
are
you
saying
it
has
to
be
an
important
interest?
then
if
speech
isn't
involved,
then
just
any
old
rational
basis
will
do,
the
government
can
do
whatever
they
want.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
there
were
some
sort
of
a
disclaimer
or
an
affirmation,
i
suppose
it
would
be,
this
message
is
required
and
permitted
by
a
governmental
program
and
governmental
regulations.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
the
test
just
is
whether
or
not
it's
against
a
particular
taxpayer's
or
contributor's
interest.
i
don't
think
that's
going
to
work.
i'm
concerned
about
the
museum,
hypothetic--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
what
would
happen
in
this
case,
everything's
the
same
except
the
department
of
agriculture
writes
all
this
stuff?
they
assess,
then
you
would
have
somebody
in
the
department
of
agri...
that
would
bring
it
on
a
parallel
with
the
museum
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
the
government
just
advertise
mushrooms
on
its
own?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
some
kinds
of
mushrooms?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
can't
target
a
particular
group
to
pay
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
the
fundamental
principle
just
that
there's
a
slippery
slope
here?
suppose
you
have
tires
that
are
coming
apart
at
high
speeds,
there's
two
ways
to
solve
it.
one
is
for
the
government
to
inspect
everything
and
to
charge
the
tire
makers
for
the
inspection
fee
and
then
put
a
government
inspection
label
on
it.
i
assume
no
problem
with
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
auto
tire...
tire
makers
have
to
pay
for
it.
let's
say
that
it
is
more
cost
effective
for
the
tire
makers
to
simply
advertise
that
they
have
been
inspected
by
the
government
and
the
tire
makers
are
required
to
do
that.
assume
that
it
costs
the
same
or
even
less
to
require
the
advertising
scheme,
but
that
the
same
objectives
are
achieved
so
far
as
the
market.
why
is
the
government
prohibited
from
doing
one
and
not
the
other,
just
because
of
the
slippery
slope
of
speech?
