justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
correct,
as
your
opponent
in
the
red
brief
says,
that
there
are
actually
two
different
rather
dramatically
different
kinds
of
programs
in
the
department
of
agriculture
and
that
this
is
not
in
the
same
group
that
the
one
in
wileman
was
involved
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
does
the
tax
apply
to
everybody
who
benefits
from
the
speech?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
tax
imposed
on
every
producer
who
benefits
from
the
speech?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
imposed
on
all
of
those
who
benefit
from
the
speech?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
imposed
on
all
those
who
benefit
from
the
speech?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes
or
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask,
if
the
government
has
made
this
argument,
and
there
have
been
a
bunch
of
these
cases
involving
different
programs,
meat
and
pears
and
so
on.
has
the
government
made
the
government
speech
argument
in
any
of
these
other
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
i
had
one
other
question
that's
based
on
something
in
the
red
brief.
i
don't
recall
this,
but
they
quote
from
the
oral
argument
in
the
case,
the
wileman
case,
saying
that
the
government
said
they
would
lose
if
it
were
not
a
marketing
program
like
this,
is
that
a
correct
statement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
another
question
i
have
on
the
government
speech
argument.
how
significant
is
it
that
it
wasn't
raised
below,
and
you're
the
petitioner,
you're
not
the
respondent?
i
know
you
say
it's
embraced
within
the
question
presented,
but
does
that
satisfy
the
procedural
requirement?
normally
when
petitioner
relies
on
an
argument,
the
petitioner
should
have
raised
it
at
some
earlier
stage
in
the
litigation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what's
the
closest
case
you
can
call
our
attention
to
that
would
say
you
have
not
procedurally
defaulted
the
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
i
may
just
interrupt,
nobody's
forced
to
say
anything
here.
your
client
doesn't
have
to
say
anything.
all
he
has
to
do
is
pay
money
into
a
fund.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
it
can
finance
its
own
message.
it
is
not
being
compelled
to
say
anything
as
a
separate
entity.
