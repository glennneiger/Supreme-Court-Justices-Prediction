justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
speak
of
the
economic
program.
what
is
the
economic
program
other
than
the
program
requiring
contributions
to
this
advertising
scheme?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
did
those--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
wileman,
the
argument,
i
didn't
think
it
was
a
persuasive
one,
but
the
argument
that
carried
the
day
in
wileman
was
that
the
restrictions
on
speech,
which
i
agree
fall
within
justice
scalia's
hypo
were
justified
because
they
were
incidental
to
and
they
were
germane
to
what
was
a
true
act
of
market
regulation.
there
was
regulation
by
quality
control
on
what
could
be
marketed,
and
there
was
regulation
in
terms
of
quantity
that
could
be
marketed.
now,
i
take
it
there
are
no
such
features
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
sorry,
you're
right.
the
standards
for
bringing
fruit
to
market
were
in
wileman,
you're
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
do
you
make
of
the
germaneness
argument
in
wileman
and
its
relation
to
this
case?
i
mean,
it's
got
to
be
germane,
the
argument
in
wileman
was
that
the
restrictions
were
germane
to
these
other
market
regulatory
activities,
and
what
you
have
described
as
the
government's
activities
here
seem
to
be
entirely
either
advertising
or
other
promotional
activities.
you
said,
well,
they
tell
the
produce
managers
where
to
put
the
mushrooms
in
the
stores.
i
mean,
that
isn't
market
regulation.
it's,
i
would
say
it's
simply
promotion,
teaching
them
how
to
sell
mushrooms.
so
i
don't
see
that
there
is
anything
to
which
this
is
germane
which
is
comparable
to
the
scheme
in
wileman.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
did
the
court
spend
all
the
time
that
it
did
discussing
germaneness?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
in
that
case
then
you're
simply
saying
that
the
advertising
scheme
was
in
effect
germane
to
a
general
scheme
of
addressing
the
desirability
of
marketing
this
material,
and
that
seems
to
me
to
read
the
germaneness
requirement
right
out
of,
you
know,
right
out
of
any
significance.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
thought
the
smoking,
i
thought
the
justification
for
the
smoking
example,
as
you
put
it,
was
to
fill
a
gap,
which
i
took
it
as
a
way
of
saying
it
required
the
correction
of
what
would
otherwise
have
been
a
misleading
presentation
by
the
tobacco
company.
justice
david
h.
souter
--oh,
oh,
oh.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
sorry,
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
likewise
here
if
every
100th
mushroom
was
blue
and
blue
mushrooms
made
you
sick,
there
would
be
no
problem--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
funding
a
scheme
saying
look
out
for
the
blue
mushroom?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
only
difference
was
the
particular
thing.
germane
there
to
product
quality,
germane
here
to
expanding
the
market.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
hurrah.
