ms.
mcdowell,
is
that
perhaps
why
you
raise
an
alternative
argument,
that
this,
in
fact,
is
government
speech?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
it
because
of
this
problem
that
you've
been
listening
to
this
morning
that
it
doesn't
appear
to
be
part
of
a
broader
regulatory
program?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
that
argument
made
below?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
are
you
going
to
address
it
in
your
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
our
closest
case
that
supports
this
kind
of
fee
to
pay
for
some
kind
of
government
designed
speech?
what
do
you
rely
on?
