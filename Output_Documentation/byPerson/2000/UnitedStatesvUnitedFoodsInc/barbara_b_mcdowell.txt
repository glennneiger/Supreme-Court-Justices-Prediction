ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
assessments
imposed
under
the
mushroom
promotion,
research,
and
consumer
information
act
do
not
abridge
the
freedom
of
speech
of
any
mushroom
producer.
no
producer
is
restrained
by
the
act
from
communicating
any
message
to
any
audience,
no
producer
is
compelled
to
speak,
and
no
producer
is
compelled
to
fund
the
expression
of
others'
political
or
ideological
views.
mushroom
producers
are
simply
required
to
contribute
to
the
costs
of
a
program
of
commercial
speech
and
other
activities
designed
to
further
the
economic
interests
of
their
own
industry.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
not
entirely,
your
honor,
no,
but
congress
is
entitled
in
this
sort
of
economic
program
to
make
the
determination
that
the
interests
of
the
industry
as
a
whole
would
benefit
from
such
a
program.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
the
program
is
not
limited
to
advertising,
justice
souter.
as
the
title
of
the
statute
suggests,
it's
promotion,
research,
and
consumer
education,
so
the
programs
authorized
by
the
mushroom
council
can
and
in
some
instances
do
include
more
than
advertising.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct,
justice
kennedy,
as
long
as
congress
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
strengthening
the
market
for
a
particular
agricultural
commodity,
congress
is
entitled
under
wileman
to
enact
this
sort
of
program
and
impose
it
upon
an
industry.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
it
is,
commercial
speech.
certainly
if
an
individual
producer
was
engaging
in
the
same
sort
of
message,
the
government
would
be
constrained
by
the
commercial
speech
doctrine
from
restricting
the
speech.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct.
of
course,
such
programs
are
subject
to
other
constitutional
constraints,
such
as
rational
basis
considerations
and--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
then
presumably
you
wouldn't
be
a
mushroom
producer
and
you
wouldn't
be
covered
by
this
statute.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
i
still
think
in
those
circumstances
you
would
be
outside
the
statute
because
you
wouldn't
be
selling
them
for
consumption.
on
the
other
hand--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--it's
a
line
that
the
court
drew
in
wileman
brothers
itself
contrasting
those
sorts
of
objections
of
fruit
producers
with
the
kinds
of
objections
that
were
asserted
in
cases
like
abood
and
keller,
objections
to,
for
example,
a
nuclear
freeze
initiative
that
the
california
bar
had
supported
or
contributions
to
political
candidates
in
the
abood
context.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
those
would
clearly
fall
on
that
side
of
the
line,
whereas--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--pardon
me?
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
certainly
respondent
and
others
are
free,
notwithstanding
the
mushroom
act
to
express
their
own
views
about
the
benefits
of
a
free
economy.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
in
fact,
justice
ginsburg,
other
programs
are
going
on.
there
has
been
research
into
the
nutritional
and
health
benefits
of
mushrooms,
there's
a
considerable
amount
of
working
with
grocery
store
managers
in
terms
of
the
placement
of
mushrooms,
safe
storage
of
mushrooms,
other
programs
of
that
nature,
but
probably
the
bulk
of
the
expenditures
of
the
program
to
date
have
been
for
public
relations
and
publicity
type
activities,
but
there
are
other
activities
going
on
here
as
well.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
it's
true,
justice
stevens,
that
the
program
in
wileman
brothers
was
authorized
under
the
agricultural
marketing
agreements
act
and
programs
authorized
under
that
act
sometimes,
in
most
cases,
in
fact,
do
include
other
regulations,
but
there
are
some
11
promotion,
research,
and
consumer
information
programs
that
are
quite
similar
to
this
one,
including
the
ones
in
the
beef,
pork,
and
cotton
industries.
all
of
these
programs
in
different
years
involved
different
components
of
research,
consumer
information,
and
promotion.
so
it
would
be
difficult
to
draw
a
line
between
which
were
more
and
less
like
the
ones
in
wileman
brothers.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
that
was
certainly
one
of
the
complaints
that
was
raised
in
wileman
brothers,
and
it
wasn't
given
constitutional
significance.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
presumably
congress
could
determine
that
there
were
benefits
to
be
obtained
to
the
entire
industry
by
promotion
that
focused
at
least
in
one
year
on
particular
products.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
presumably
congress
could
do
that,
justice
scalia,
but
that's
not
what
this
program
does.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct,
but
i
would
disagree
with
your
premise
that
there
were
quantity
controls
in
wileman
brothers.
there
weren't.
there
were
only
quality
and
maturity
controls.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes.
we
don't
think
that
those
differences
in
regulation
make
any
difference
with
respect
to
the
first
amendment
interests
that
are
implicated
here.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
we
had
raised
that
alternative
argument,
justice
o'connor.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
we
raised
the
government
speech
argument
because
we
think
it's
also
a
viable
argument.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no,
it
wasn't
made
below.
we
believe
that
it's
encompassed
by
the
question
presented
in
our
petition,
and
that
the
court
has
the
discretion
to
reach
that
question
if
it
wants
to.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
i
will,
if
i
could
just
return
briefly
to
justice
souter's
question
because
i
think
our
argument
in
wileman
brothers
and
how
we
read
the
court's
opinion
is
not
that
the
generic
advertising
program
has
to
be
germane
to
some
separate
regulatory
program.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
as
we
understand
the
court's
opinion,
the
court
was
saying
that
the
generic
advertising
program
was
germane
to
congress's
interest
in
strengthening
and
stabilizing
the
market
for
an
agricultural
product,
and
that's
precisely
the
same
interest--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--we
would
disagree.
we
think
that
in
both
this
case
and
wileman
brothers
there
was
a
legitimate
nonspeech
purpose
for
the
regulation,
and
that
was
strengthening
and
stabilizing
the
market
for
a
commodity.
it
wasn't
there
and
it
isn't
here
simply
to
encourage
speech
about
mushrooms.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
the
opinion
certainly
can
be
read
in
that
manner,
and
here,
as
in
wileman
brothers,
there
is
no
political
or
ideological
content
to
the
speech.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
the
court
has
so
held
in
cases
such
as
lehnert
where
the
court
allowed
nonmembers'
dues
to
be
used
to
fund
certain
union
programs
which
were
not
ideological
and
were
not
particularly
germane
to
the
purpose
of
collective
bargaining
but
were
nonetheless
considered
to
be
permissible.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
we
would
still
view
that
i
think
as
a
commercial
message,
but
it
would
be
somewhat
more
problematic
because
the
clothing
producers
would
be
required
to
fund
a
program
that's
directly
contrary
to
their
interests.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
it's
a
somewhat
more
difficult
question
than
this
one,
justice
kennedy,
i
will
agree
with
you.
if
there
is
a
sufficiently
important
government
interest,
it
might
well
be
permissible.
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
always
rational
basis
standards
that
apply,
and
it
might
not
seem
rational
to
single
out
the
clothing
producers
in
this
instance
for
that
sort
of
an
assessment.
it
seems
much
more
rational
to
impose
an
assessment
on
those
members
of
the
industry
that
benefit.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
pardon
me?
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
perhaps
an
important
interest
under
the
abood
standard
if
one
is
to
view
this
as
ideological
speech.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
it
happens
rarely,
your
honor,
but
perhaps
congress
could
be--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
the
court
certainly
has
done
that
in
instances
where
the
group
singled
out
the
taxation
was,
for
example,
the
media,
but
obviously
the
hypothetical
posited
by
justice
kennedy
wouldn't
involve
that.
if
i
could
get--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--i
was
about
to
get
back
to
that,
thank
you.
it's
our
view
that
the
speech
here
is
speech
of
the
government,
funded
by
taxes
or
user
fees
on
those
who
are
perceived
by
congress
to
benefit
the
most
from
the
speech.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
pardon
me?
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
it's
imposed
on
those
who
congress
determined
would
benefit
the
most.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
surely
there
may
be
some
small
producers
that--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--no,
no.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
and
indeed
congress
perceived
the
statute
to
benefit
the
entire
agricultural
industry,
and
indeed
the
entire
agricultural
industry
does
not
pay
those
assessments,
either,
but
congress
determined
that
the
major
mushroom
producers
would
be
the
ones
who
benefited
the
most,
and
the
vast
majority
of
the
industry
does
contribute
to
the
assessments.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
congress
could
reasonably
determine
that
the
costs
of
imposing
the
tax
on
the
very,
very
small
producers
would
exceed
the
benefits
of
doing
so.
for
example,
under
the
current
assessment
of
a
quarter
cent
per
pound
of
mushrooms
produced,
the
smaller
producers,
those
who
are
exempt,
would
pay
at
most
$1250
a
year,
and
that's
really
a
very
small
amount.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
that's
correct,
but
we
don't
believe
that
the
commercial
speech
cases,
central
hudson,
and
so
on
are
applicable
here
because
we're
not
talking
about
restrictions
on
anyone's
speech
or
regulations
of
speech.
rather,
we're
talking
about
a
program
that
imposes
a
tax
or
user
fee
for
the
purpose
of
encouraging
more
consumer
speech,
not
less.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
in
contrast
to
buckley,
though,
this
isn't
a
program
that
restricts
people's
speech,
that
limits
how
much
mushroom
producers
can
speak.
they
are
free
to
speak
as
much
as
they
want
to.
they
are
only
required
to
contribute
money
to
this
program
in
addition
so
that
there
can
be
generic
speech.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
i'm
not
sure
that
we
have
any
case
of
this
court
that
involves
a
targeted
fee
to
pay
for
a
government
speech
program.
certainly
the
court
has
recognized,
although
not
necessarily
relied
as
a
holding
on
the
principle
that
the
government
isn't
subject
to
the
constraints
of
the
first
amendment
when
it
speaks
on
its
own
behalf,
and
the
court
has
recognized
that
all
government
programs
don't
have
to
be
funded
through
general
tax
revenues
but
can
be
targeted,
can
be
funded
through
a
variety
of
user
fees
and
other
targeted
taxes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
that
would
obviously
be
a
line
could
you
draw,
justice
kennedy.
there
are
some
cases
that
have
similar
aspects,
where
the
government
has
imposed
a
user
fee
on
individual
speakers,
for
example
in
the
context
of
the
cox
case,
the
court
recognized
that
user
fees
could
be
imposed
to
reimburse
local
government
for
the
costs
of
administering
parades,
and
so
there
seems
to
be
nothing
inconsistent
with
the
first
amendment
with
requiring
special
taxes
or
assessments
for
speech
activity.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
we
made
the
argument
in
the
frame
case,
which
was
the
case
that
conflicted
with
wileman
brothers,
a
third
circuit
case.
the
third
circuit,
although
it
perceived
the
question
as
a
close
one,
did
not
rule
for
the
government
on
the
government
speech
ground.
it
instead
ruled
on
the
ground
that
there
was
a
compelling
interest
for
the
beef
program,
which
is
very
much
like
the
mushroom
program.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no,
it's
not
a
correct
statement,
your
honor.
what
we
said
was
that
if
the
court
didn't
recognize
that
there
was
an
important
purpose
to
be
served
by
these
programs,
we
would
lose,
but
we
didn't
tie
our
argument
in
wileman
to
the
existence
of
additional
regulation.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
we
were
arguing
in
that
case
pre
wileman,
obviously,
before
the
court's
wileman
decision
that
the
abood
standard
was
the
appropriate
one
to
apply
in
these
cases,
and
under
abood
the
speech
program
that's
funded
by
the
objectors
has
to
be
germane
to
an
important
government
purpose,
and
so
that's
why
we
were
arguing
that
the
purpose
was
at
least
important.
we
would
argue,
of
course,
that
the
purpose
of
the
mushroom
act
is
also
an
important
one
to
strengthen
the
mushroom
industry,
as
congress
found,
and
to
thereby
strengthen
the
entire
agricultural
commodity.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
i
wouldn't
be
able
to
give
you
one,
justice
scalia,
but
certainly
in
this
case
congress
conducted
hearings
on
the
mushroom
act,
heard
from
both
sides
of
the
issue,
and
heard
some
legitimate
concerns
from
members
of
the
mushroom
industry
about
developments
in
the
industry
over
the
past
decade
or
so
that
had
resulted
in
many
mushroom
farmers
going
out
of
business.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
i'm
not
aware
of
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
to
get
back
to
the
government
speech
argument,
we
would
emphasize
that
the
mushroom
council,
the
entity
that
engages
in
this
speech,
was
created
specially
by
congress,
congress
specified
that
the
secretary
of
agriculture
would
appoint
all
members
of
the
mushroom
council,
congress
specified
the
categories
of
activities
in
which
the
mushroom
council
could
and
could
not
engage
and
congress
provided
that
the
secretary
of
agriculture
would
have
to
approve
each
plan,
project,
and
budgeted
the
mushroom
council
before
it
was--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
we
would
suggest
that
this
particular
program
doesn't
involve
any
infringement
of
speech
interests
at
all.
the
court
has
suggested
that
there
are
some
first
amendment
interests--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--implicated
in
cases
such
as
abood
with--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
that's
correct,
and
that's
what
the
court
seemed
to
recognize
in
wileman
brothers,
that
this
case
did
not
implicate
any
special
first
amendment
interests
at
all
and
therefore
rational
basis
applied.
we
had
argued
in
wileman
brothers
not
for
a
standard
that
lenient
but
for
the
abood
standard,
and
we
were
arguing
there
that
the
programs
from
california
tree
fruits
satisfied
that
standard,
as
would
the
mushroom
program
here.
no
further--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--we
should
have
raised
it,
your
honor,
that's
true.
we
didn't.
we
think
that
the
court
certainly
has
jurisdiction
and
discretion
to
address
it
in
this
case,
and
the
court
has
addressed
similar
cases
that
have
come
up
in
similar
circumstances.
when
cases
occur--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--vance
v.
terrozzas,
444
u.s.
252,
a
1980
decision
by
justice
white.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no,
we
believe
that
under
wileman
this
is
not
the
sort
of
objection
that
would
amount
to
an
ideological
one,
one
that
would
invalidate
the
entire
program.
it's
more
as
the
court
put
it
in
wileman,
a
disagreement
about
tactics.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
there
is
certainly
a
procedure
through
the
mushroom
council
which
consists
of
persons
who
were
nominated
by
members
of
the
mushroom
industry
to
contact
them
and
to
express
disagreement.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
such
complaints
can
certainly
be
voiced
to
the
secretary
of
agriculture
as
well.
there's
not
a
mechanism,
for
example,
for
obtaining
a
refund
for
this
sort
of
expression
with
which
one
might
disagree,
but
there
are
avenues
for
expressing
objections.
indeed,
i
would
note
that
respondent's
own
representative
was
a
member
of
the
mushroom
council
at
the
time
that
the
so
called
aphrodisiac
program
was
implemented,
and
he
voiced
his
objection
to
it
at
the
time
and
apparently
was
not
persuasive
to
the
other
members
of
the
council,
but
he
certainly
was
heard
on
that
matter.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
i
did
want
to
correct
the
suggestion
that,
as
mr.
tribe
put
it,
the
secretary
of
agriculture
does
not
have
general
censorial
power
over
the
speech
of
the
mushroom
council.
indeed,
she
does.
it's
inherent
in
7
usc
6104
(d)(3),
no
plan
or
project
of
promotion,
research,
consumer
information
or
industry
information
or
budget
shall
be
implemented
prior
to
its
approval
by
the
secretary.
indeed,
i'm
informed
by
the
department
of
agriculture
that
secretaries
of
agriculture
have
censored
speech
of
agricultural
groups
such
as
this
one
on
grounds
of
taste
as
well
as
on
grounds
of
lack
of
conformity
with
the
statute
and
regulations.
mr.
tribe
referred
to
the
theory
that
the
government
should
not
be
buttoning
a
person's
lip
or
forcing
them
to
speak.
this
program
does
neither
for
the
reasons
recognized
in
wileman
brothers.
respondent
is
not
required
to
engage
in
any
speech
nor
is
respondent's
own
speech
censored
in
any
manner
by
the
mushroom
act.
the
mushroom
producers
such
as
respondent
are
merely
required
to
contribute
to
an
economic
program
to
promote
their
product.
sometimes
perhaps,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
money
can
be
speech,
but
here
it's
just
money.
thank
you.
