ruth
bader

ms.
mcdowell,
i
take
it
you're
making
a
point
that
in
that
respect
it's
no
different
from
wileman,
but
you've
gotten
away
from
a
point
that
you
started
on
when
justice
kennedy
put
a
question
to
you.
you
of
course
are
trying
to
make
this
as
much
like
wileman
as
you
can.
is
there
anything
in
this
program,
as
there
was
in
that
one,
other
than
the
advertising?
you
said
the
statute
authorizes
research
and
something
else
you
mentioned,
but
in
fact
is
anything
going
on
other
than
the
advertising?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
couldn't
at
least
one
read...
there
may
be
ambiguity
in
it,
but
wileman
to
have
alternative
arguments
that
is
one
is
the
germaneness
thing,
but
then
i
think
the
court
used
expressions
like
in
any
event,
which
sounds
like
that's
a
self
standing
ground,
that
it
wasn't
necessary
to
have
both,
if
it
had
either,
it
would
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
message
here
other
than--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mushrooms
are
so
good
for
you?
i
mean,
i
thought
that
that
was
your
central
point,
that
unlike
central
hudson,
this
is
not
a
restriction
on
what
anybody
can
say.
this
is
just
a
message
that
presumably
all
who
sell
mushrooms
couldn't
object
to.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
a
procedure
to
object
to
that?
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
mushrooms
are
so
good
to
eat,
but
if
one
says
they're
an
aphrodisiac,
is
there
a
procedure
to
object
to
that
kind
of
advertisement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
the
secretary
of
agriculture?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
tribe,
how
does
that
differ
from
some
tree
fruits
that
were
covered
and
others
weren't
in
wileman?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
that
so?
couldn't
the
secretary
of
agriculture
say
i
veto
this
message,
we
won't
have
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
he's
an
approver,
that
if
he
doesn't
approve,
the
message
doesn't
go
out.
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
he
hasn't
exercised
it,
but
where
in
the
statute
does
it
say
he
doesn't
have
that
authority?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
surgeon
general
has
determined
that
smoking
is
hazardous
to
health.
that's
a
message
that
the
government
compels
every
cigarette
manufacturer
to
put.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
in
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
that
that
too
is
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
these
cases,
like
central
hudson,
say
this
is
what
you
can't
say.
in
this
case
the
argument
is
nobody
is
stopping
any
individual
producer
from
saying
whatever
they
want
to
say.
they
must
in
addition
support
the
generic
advertising,
but
except
for
the
theory
that
there's
only
a
limited
kitty
and
if
i
have
to
support
generic
i
won't
be
able
to
plug
my
own
product,
it
is
very
different
from
saying
i'm
closing
your
mouth,
you
cannot
say
x.
i'm
saying
you
can
say
x,
but
you
must
in
addition
say
y.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
tribe,
all
this
depends
on
your
reading
wileman
in
a
way
other
than
justice
souter
appeared
to
read
it
in
his
footnote
3
when
he
said--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--germane
is
one
thing
or
is
not
ideological.
he
seemed
to
think
that
this
opinion
had
two
legs,
and
it
could
stand
on
one
or
the
other.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
from
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
court's
opinion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
reading
the...
or
from
the
dissenting
opinion.
