not
in
their
view?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
it
can't
cover
ideological
speech.
what
is
ideological
speech?
i
mean,
suppose
i
am
a
member
of
the
people
for
the
ethical
treatment
of
mushrooms,
and
i
think
that
mushrooms
should
not
be
eaten
at
all,
can
i
be
compelled
to
take
part
in
this
advertising?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
no,
i
produce
them
to
make
them
happy.
i
just
don't
harvest
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
it
be
ideological?
i
mean
what
is
this
ideological
line
that
you're
drawing?
i
mean,
what
if
i
feel
adamantly
about
a
free
market
and
this
advertising
is
slanting
the
market?
i
feel
passionately
that
as
an
ideological
matter
a
free
market
is
a
good
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
nuclear
freezes
and
political
candidates
are
ideological.
justice
antonin
scalia
free
economy
is
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
free
economy
is
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
presume
you
can
be
forced
to
contribute
to
a
program
that
is
clearly
against
your
economic
interests.
i
mean,
you're
a
peach
grower
and
you're
compelled
to
contribute
to
an
advertising
program
promoting
yellowish
peaches
whereas
you're
growing
orangey
peaches.
you
could
be
compelled
to
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
answer
is
yes?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
make
you
contribute
to
the
saying
that
my
competitor's
product
is
better
than
mine?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
you're...
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
mcdowell,
if
germaneness
to
a
government
regulatory
program
is
irrelevant,
how
do
you
explain
the
limitations
we've
placed
upon
compulsory
union
dues?
could
a
union
compel
nonunion
members
to
contribute
to
union
activities
other
than
those
of
representing
the
employees
so
long
as
those
other
union
activities
are
not
ideological?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
the
last
case
in
which
a
tax
scheme
was
stricken
down
because
the
objects
of
it
were
irrational?
justice
antonin
scalia
very,
very
rarely
rational
basis
of
taxation
is
almost
anything
goes.
i
can't
imagine
striking
down
that
scheme
on
the
basis
that
it's
irrational
because
of
the
taxpayers
identified.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
anything
that
congress
does
that
is
not
important?
i
mean,
if
strengthening
the
mushroom
program
is
important,
what
is
not
important?
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
some
government
program
that
is
not
important,
less
important
than
strengthening
the
mushroom
program?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
subterranean
group,
no
doubt.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
it
could
be,
mr.
tribe,
that
the
mushroom
example
strikes
us
as
different
from
the
museum
example
or
the
tobacco
example
simply
because
we're
more
permitting
of
restrictions
upon
free
speech
for
reasons
that
we
consider
good,
and
maybe
we
like
museums
a
lot
and
we
hate
smoking
a
lot,
and
we're
quite
indifferent
to
mushrooms.
that
might
express,
it
might
be
the
reason
behind
why
these
examples
cause
difficulty.
i
frankly
don't
see
any
more
justification
for
the
museum
example
or
the
tobacco
example
than
i
do
for
the
mushrooms.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
don't
like
the
museum
and
the
smoking
example,
right?
i
mean,
on
that
theory,
they
would
be
bad.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
i
meant
the
other
smoking
example
of
general
advertising,
smoking
is
bad--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
the
thing
on
cigarettes.
justice
antonin
scalia
poor
quality--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
one
manner
of
competing,
you
sell
poor
quality--
justice
antonin
scalia
--goods
at
a
cheaper
price.
some
people
prefer
to
pay
less
and
can't
tell
the
difference.
