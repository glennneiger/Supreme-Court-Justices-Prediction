justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
how
does
that
nondiscriminatory
get
into
it?
suppose
congress
simply
reduces
the
salaries
of
all
federal
employees,
officers
and
employees,
and
judges
among
them.
surely
the
fact
that
it
was
nondiscriminatory
wouldn't
prevent
it
from
violating
the
compensation
clause,
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
although
you
could
say
they're
clearly
not
trying
to
impair
the
independence
of
judges.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that,
because
a
tax
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
their
compensation,
and
therefore
it
doesn't
count?
why
would
a
discriminatory
tax
violate
the
compensation
clause,
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
compensation,
you
could
do
it
discriminatorily,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
maybe...
you
call
it
a
central
purpose,
but
it's
not
the
only
purpose,
and
it's
clear
that
another
purpose
is
to
enable
those
who
come
to
the
bench,
setting
aside
a
lucrative
profession,
to
be
able
to
be
sure
that
they
will
get
so
much
money
over
the
term
of
their
lifetime
service.
you
acknowledge
that's
one
of
the
purposes.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
purpose.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
disagree
with
alexander
hamilton,
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there,
it
was
because
they
had
not
yet
become
effective,
and
therefore
they
were
not
part
of
the
compensation
that
the
judges
had--
justice
antonin
scalia
--perhaps,
but
is
it
fair
to
equate
payments
into
a
retirement
system
with
general
taxes?
i
mean,
when
employers
offer
compensation,
they
offer
a
compensation
package,
which
very
often
includes
retirement
plans.
some
of
them
are
contributory,
some
of
them
are
noncontributory,
but
that
is
part
of
the
whole
scheme
of
compensation,
and
it
may
well
be
the
case
that
the
general
taxes
are
something
entirely
different,
but
does
that
necessarily
show
that
contributions
to
retirement
schemes
are
entirely
different?
isn't
that
much
closer
to
involving
the
compensation
of
the
judges?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
was
meant
to
replace
for
these
judges
the
civil
service
retirement
system,
wasn't
it,
which
they
previously
had
been
entitled
to
participate
in?
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
replaced
that
element
of
compensation
with
the
social
security
system
for
other
federal
employees,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
yet
you
say
that
it
really
has
nothing
to
do
with--
justice
antonin
scalia
--retirement
or
compensation
for
retirement.
it
seems
to
me
congress
thought
it
very
much
did.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
the
contributory
versus
noncontributory
factor,
whether
you
get
out
as
much
as
you
put
in,
why
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
it
is
realistically
regarded
as
part
of
your
total
compensation?
does
it
make
a
difference,
when
an
employer
hires
you
and
promises
you
a
certain
retirement
system,
whether
you
contribute
to
it
or
not,
or
whether,
you
know,
somehow
it
is
tied
to
your
wages
or
not?
it
seems
to
me
it's
part
of
the
total
employment
package.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
be,
but
when
they
do
come
to
the
step
of
extending
it
or
not
extending
it
to
this
very
discrete
group
of
individuals,
judges,
you're
confronted
with
the
problem
that
they
may
be
induced
to
extend
it
or
not
to
extend
it
on
the
basis
of
whether
they
like
judges
or
not,
on
the
basis
of
whether
they
think
these
judges
have
been
coming
out
with
decisions
of
the
sort
they
like
or
not.
once
you
allow
congress,
whether
it's
part
of
a
step-by-step
proceeding
or
not,
to
single
out
judges
for
an
imposition
of
this
sort,
you
run
the
risk
that,
you
know,
that
they're
doing
it
for
a
wrong
reason,
and
we
can't
inquire
case-by-case
whether
they
did
it
because
they
were
mad
at
judges
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
how
you'd
find
that
out,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
okay,
you
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
there's
some
science
fiction
book
i
read
once
that
had
a
devilishly
clever
plot
in
which
one
of
the
protagonists
is
poisoned,
but
he
has
a
poison
scanner
that
detects
all
sorts
of
poison,
so
you
couldn't
get
to
him
that
way,
and
the
way
they
get
to
him
is
that
they
give
him
something
that
isn't
poison,
but
that
is
very
addictive,
and
then
withhold
it
from
him,
and
if
he
doesn't
get
it,
he
will
die.
you're
saying
that
you
can
do
the
same
thing
with
federal
judges.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
cannot
put
a
new
tax
just
on
judges,
but
when
they
come
in,
you
can
say,
hey,
guys,
we're
going
to
give
all
of
you
a
special
tax
exemption,
and
if
you
behave
yourselves,
you
can
keep
that
tax
exemption,
but
you
get
us
mad,
and
you're
not
going
to
have
that
special
exemption
any
more.
you
really
think
that
that's
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
the
reason
that
judges
were
distinguished
from
some
other
categories
in
this
general
revision
of
the
federal
retirement
system,
isn't
one
of
the
reasons
that
they
had
a
guaranteed
retirement
income,
and
that
was
the
basis
for
narrowing
the
focus
to
judges?
do
you
think
that's
a
fair
basis
for
saying,
well,
since
you
have
this
retirement
income,
which
the
constitution
guarantees
you,
we're
going
to
use
that
guaranteed
income
as
the
basis
for
treating
you
differently
from
other
people?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
really
don't
think
hamilton
would
have
bought
your
argument
there.
i
think...
you
know,
the
judge
knows
where
he
stands--
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
my
poison
example,
it's
the
same
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rosenthal,
does
this
targeting
of
judges
almost
exclusively
apply
to
both
programs,
or
just
to
one
of
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
say,
as
i
understand
your
argument...
i
don't
understand
why
you
wouldn't...
that
if
everybody
in
the
country
had
a
10,000
dollar
exemption,
your
first
10,000
dollars
is
for
free,
okay,
and
then
they
took
it
away
for
the
whole
country,
is
it
your
contention
that
judges
alone
would
have
to
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
understand
that's
your
position,
and
it's
a
reasonable
outcome,
but
i
don't
see
why
the
logic
of
your
argument
supports
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
on
the
discriminatory
point
i
understand--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you're
using
this
argument
for
the
aspect
of
your
case
in
which
there
is
no
discrimination.
