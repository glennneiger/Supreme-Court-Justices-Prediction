mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
congress
brought
federal
judges
within
the
coverage
of
the
social
security
and
medicare
programs,
they
began
to
share
with
the
vast
majority
of
all
other
americans
the
costs
and
benefits
of
a
universal
program
of
social
insurance
that
benefits
society
at
large.
the
obligation
to
participate
in
those
programs
posed
no
threat
to
the
central
purpose
of
the
compensation
clause,
which
is
to
protect
the
judiciary
from
interference
from
the
other
political
branches.
as
this
court
recognized
in
o'malley
v.
woodruff,
judges
are
also
citizens,
and
the
compensation
clause
does
not
grant
them
an
immunity
from
participating
in
the
burden
of
government,
whose
constitution
and
laws
they
are
charged
with
administering.
a
nondiscriminatory
tax
that
falls
on
judges
as
well
as
most
other
citizens
does
not
violate
the
compensation
clause.
the
concern
that
the
framers
had
with
congress'
possibly
abusing
its
power
to
set
judges'
statutory
salaries
does
not
apply
to
congress'
application
and
extension
of
a
nondiscriminatory
tax
on
income.
now,
the
framers
understood
that
when
congress
exercised
its
authority
to
enact
statutory
salaries,
it
would
have
the
opportunity
for
mischief.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
that's
the
holding,
of
course,
of
will,
which
is
that
a
nondiscriminatory
reduction
in
federal
employees'
salaries
that
includes
judges
does
violate
the
compensation
clause,
but
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
a
direct
reduction
of
judges'
salaries
violates
the
plain
language
of
the
clause,
because
it
is,
after
all,
a
diminution
of
their
compensation
that
is
owed
to
them
for
their
services,
but
it's
another
thing...
and...
but
it's
another
thing
to
say
that
a
tax,
which
is
not
a
direct
reduction
of
their
compensation
but
is
an
obligation
that
they
must
share
with
all
other
citizens,
implicates
the
compensation
clause.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
first
of
all,
i
think--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i'm
not
sure
it
would
violate
the
compensation
clause
itself.
it
very
likely
would
violate
fundamental
principles
underlying
article
iii,
a
discriminatory
tax,
even
if
it
didn't
fall
on
judges'
compensation.
if...
one...
there
are
two,
essentially
two
different
principles
here.
one
is
a
reduction
of
judges'
compensation,
and
another
is
discriminatory
treatment
of
judges
in
some
way
which
might
or
might
not
be
directed
at
their
salary
or
at
their
income.
i
think
the
same
principles
would
apply,
a
discriminatory
tax
principle
would
apply
if
congress--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
cases
like
plaut
v.
spendthrift
farm
show
that
there
are
broader
principles
protecting
the
independence
of
the
judiciary
that
go
beyond
some
political
interference,
that
go
beyond
just
the
compensation
clause,
but
i
want
to
add,
even
if
i'm
wrong,
and
even
if
one
should
analyze
the
discriminatory
tax
on
judges'
salaries
under
the
compensation
clause,
that
doesn't
mean
one
would
have
to
also
conclude
that
a
nondiscriminatory
tax
violates
the
compensation
clause,
because
the
clause
would
still
be
interpreted
in
light
of
its
central
purpose,
which
is
to
protect
judges
from
interference
with
their
function
by
the
political
branches.
now--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
certainly
acknowledge
that
that
is
a
benefit
that
the
compensation
clause
has,
but
i
think
it's...
i
think
it's--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
agree
that
that
is
a
central
purpose
of
the
compensation
clause.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
but
i...
hamilton
said
that
that
would
certainly
be
a
benefit
of
the
clause,
but
i
think
that
even
if
that's...
even
if
that's
so,
and
even
if
i
agree
with
you,
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow...
it
doesn't
follow,
in
fact,
that
every
expectation
that
a
judge
had,
that
he
brought
with
him,
or
her,
when
taking
office,
was
protected
from
any
disparagement
or
any
adverse
effect
by
later
action
in
congress.
after
all,
the
same
claim
was
made
in
will.
the
judges
argued
that
the
formula
for
adjusting
the
statutory
salary
had
been
built
into
the
statute
at
the
time
they
took
the
judges,
and
they
fully
expected
that
those
adjustments
in
salaries
would
come
automatically
each
year,
and
yet
congress
in
2
years
prevented
those
salaries
from
taking
effect.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
but
the
broader
point
is
that
it
just
is
not
the
case
that
every
single
expectation
that
a
judge
has
about
his
financial
position
when
he
takes
office
is
something
that
the
compensation
clause
freezes
in
place.
for
example,
congress
surely
could
have
raised
the
rate
of
the
general
applicable
income
tax
on
all
citizens
in
the
exact
same
amount
as
was
the
amount
of
the
medicare
and
social
security
taxes
in
this
case,
and
congress
could
have
done
so,
in
fact,
because
it
had
decided
that
from
this
point
on
these
programs
of
social
insurance
should
be
financed
out
of
general
income
tax
revenues
instead
of
a
separate
tax
on
income.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
i
think
that
they
bear
elements,
social
security
bears
some
analogizing
to
a
contribution
to
a
retirement
scheme,
but
it
also
is
principally
a
tax
that
is
laid
on
the
wages
and
salaries
of
every
earner.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--the...
not
only
that,
but
there's
both
a
floor
and
a
ceiling
in
social
security
benefits.
congress
has
also
made
clear
by
statute
that
it
can
adjust
social
security
benefits,
and
that
there
are
no
contractual
or
vested
rights
in
a
particular
level
of
benefit,
so--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
it's
a
pay-as-you-go
system,
principally,
and
it
operates
on
a
principle
that
a
large
fund
is
being
financed
by
all
taxpayers,
and
that
all
taxpayers...
and
that
all
wage-earners
also
derive
a
benefit
from
it,
but
there's
no
direct
connection.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
actually,
no.
the
judges...
the
judges
themselves,
while
judges,
did
not
participate
in
the
civil
service
retirement
system.
now,
federal
employees
did
participate
in
an
entirely
separate,
self-contained
system,
csrs,
and
congress
did
not
bring
incumbent
federal
employees
into
social
security
on
a
mandatory
basis.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
for
federal
employees--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
i--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
i...
no,
i
don't
think
that
congress
thought
that
social
security
is
a
civil
service
retirement
system.
it
is
not
a
contributory
retirement
system.
it
is...
it
obviously
does,
as
does
a
civil
service
retirement
system,
go
to
the...
go
to
citizens'
interests
in
retirement
income
security,
and
congress
didn't
want
federal
employees
to
have
to
pay
twice
for
retirement
income
security.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
first,
the
question
here
is
not
whether
judges'
social
security
benefits
are
part
of
their
compensation.
i
mean,
the
question
that
we
are
presenting
here
is
whether
congress
could
ask
judges,
or
could
require
judges
to
participate
in
the
financing
of
a
system
that
operates
for
the
benefit
of
society
at
large,
and
that
is
the
obligation
that
was
extended
to
judges
for
the
first
time
in
1983
and
1984.
and
the
reason
why
that
is
different
from
a
statutory
form
of
compensation,
or
why,
i
should
say,
that
the
concerns
that
the
framers
had
with
diminishing
direct
reductions
of
statutory
salary
don't
apply
here,
is
that
when
congress
enacts
and
shapes
a
general
tax
like
social
security,
it
legislates
with
the
broad
perspective
of
society
at
large,
and
it
doesn't
have
a
narrow
focus
on
the
judiciary,
and
when
congress
sets
the
generally
applicable
tax
rate,
it
is
also
constrained
by
political
checks,
by
the
popular
political
objection
to--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--mr.
chief
justice,
congress...
it's
true
congress
brought
judges...
congress
eliminated
the
exemption.
it
did
bring
judges
within
the
social
security
system,
and
that
is
part
of
a
general
progress
of
extension
of
the
social
security
system
over
time
since
1934
to
the
present.
i
mean,
it's
one
of
many
extensions
that
congress
has
made.
in
1984,
along
with
federal
judges
and
new
hires
in
the
federal
government,
it
brought
in
employees
of
nonprofit
organizations.
in
1986,
it
extended
mandatory
coverage
to
employees
of
state
and
local
governments
who
weren't
otherwise
covered
by
a
system
similar
to
csrs.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
first
of
all,
there
is
no
claim
in
this
case
that
congress
did
this
for
that
reason,
that
congress
extended
the
coverage
of
the
programs
to
judges.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
second,
this
isn't...
excuse
me.
this
is
not
the
imposition
of
a
special
tax.
this
is
the...
this
is
eliminating
an
exemption
that
had
precluded
judges
from
both
the
costs
and
benefits
of
the
social
security
program,
so
that
is
a--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
some
judges
might
have
not.
judges
also
get
a
benefit
that
society
at
large
has
from
having
a
fiscally
sound
social
security
program
that
benefits
everybody.
after
all,
the
logic
of
social
security
is
not
just
that
it
benefits
the
people
who
pay
in
specifically
for
what
they
paid
in.
it
benefits...
it
is
a
program
of
social
insurance.
it
benefits
us
all
that
other
people
obtain
social
security
benefits
and
are
not
impoverished,
do
not
have
to
draw
on
public
welfare
resources--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
don't
think
it
would
matter.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
think
that
there
was
a
wide
variety
in
judges'
experience,
and--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
it
probably
is
the
case
that
the
majority
of
judges,
majority
of
judges
were
already
fully
insured.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
a
couple
of
million,
i
think.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
that's
not
quite--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
first
of
all
it's
not
quite
right,
which
is
that
in
the
first
place
one
has
to
remember
that
close
situation
of
employees
of
the
legislative
branch
and
members
of
congress,
who
before
1984
were
not
mandatorily
covered
by
either
csrs
or
social
security,
and
they
were
required,
as
of
'84,
basically
to
choose
one,
and
so
they
were
in
roughly
the
same
situation
as
federal
judges,
which
is
that
beforehand
they
were
not
subject
to
any
mandatory
contribution,
and
the
other
person
who
is
similarly
situated
is
the
president
of
the
united
states.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
members
of
congress
and
legislative
employees--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--they
had
to
accept
one
or
the
other.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
they're
the
only
ones
who
had
to--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--they're
the
only
ones
who
had
to
accept
it
then,
yes,
but
of
course
90
percent
of
the
civilian
labor
force
had
to
accept
it.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
no,
i
understand,
but
that's
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
understand.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
they
were
the
only
people
who
were
newly
required,
as
incumbent
employees.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i'm
thinking
about
the
end
of
the
question.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
doubt
that
would
be
okay.
i
mean--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
the
question
is...
well,
first
of
all,
it
seems
to
me
that
even
though
congress
is
calling
that
a
tax,
it
really
is
not
a
tax.
it's
not
raising
revenue.
it
is
what
is,
in
effect,
a
reduction
in
judges'
salaries.
that
is
to
say,
if...
what
it
is,
is
basically
is
if
congress
had
done
the
same
thing
that
it
did
in
will,
but
had
just
called
it
a
tax.
that
is,
i
don't
think
it
would
have
mattered
to
the
decision
in
will
if,
instead
of
passing
a
law
that
said,
this
tax...
this
salary
increase
is
rescinded,
if
congress
had
said,
there
shall
be
imposed
a
tax
on
federal
judges
in
the
amount
equal
to
the
salary
increase
that
they
received
on
october
1,
1979,
so
i
mean,
i
think
the
first
question
is,
is
that
really
a
bona
fide
tax
of
any
kind,
and
so
i
think
that's
one
question.
then
the
second
question,
even
if
one
gets
that
point,
the
second
question
is,
is
there
a
legitimate
reason
for
congress
to
treat
federal
judges
differently
from
everybody
else?
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
don't
think
it
would
be
in
the
situation
that
you
present,
because
it
doesn't...
i
mean--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--justice
breyer,
i
agree
that
when
congress
treats
judges
for
tax
purposes
differently
than
other
people
who
are
similarly
situated,
it
has
to
have
a
significant
reason
for
doing
so,
but
i
would
say
two
things.
first
of
all,
i
think
that
tax
equalization,
bringing
judges
into
line
with
the
vast
majority
of
other
people
and
also
extending,
of
course,
the
benefits
of
the...
the
attendant
benefits
of
the
coverage
that
i
discussed
earlier
to
them
as
well
as
everybody
else,
as
well
as
90
percent
of
the
civilian
labor
force,
i
believe
that
that
is
a
significant
reason
for
tax
equal...
for
treating
judges
for
tax
purposes
equally,
as
all
other
citizens.
now,
the
hypothetical
that
you
gave
me
is
not
tax
equalization.
i
mean,
it's...
it
is
imposing
a
special
tax
on
judges.
so
that,
i
think
is...
i
think
that
is
almost
always,
perhaps
always,
a
legitimate
objective
of
congress,
which
is
to
treat
judges
equally
with
all
other
citizens
for
tax
purposes,
because
the
constitution
does
not
require
congress
to
grant
judges
a
perpetual
exemption
from
taxes.
what
it
does
require
congress
to
do
is
to
recognize
that
when
judges
take
office
with
a
particular
salary,
that
they
cannot
reduce
that
level
of
salary.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
i--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--yes,
they
are,
and
that
case
that
you
mentioned
is
basically
the
case
that
was
decided
by
the
fourth
circuit
in
baker
v.
commissioner,
after
this
court
decided
o'malley,
and
in
that
case,
a
panel
in
which
chief
justice
stone
sat,
it
raised
the
situation
that
after
this
court's
decision
in
miles
against
graham,
congress
exempted
judges
from
the
income
tax
and
then,
after
o'malley,
it
brought
them
back
within
the
income
tax--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--yes,
i
think
that
is
okay.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
yes,
and--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--justice
scalia,
i
think
the
problem
with
analyzing
it
that
way
is
that
there's
no
question
that
congress
could
have
raised
everybody's
income
taxes
in
the
exact
same
amount
that
it
raised
judges,
that
it
was
equal
to
the
medicare
and
social
security
taxes
in
these
cases.
so
judges
did
not
have
any
expectation...
if
they
came
into
office
at
the
salary
of
100,000
dollars
and
the
income
tax
rate
was
30
percent,
there's
no
question,
or
it
isn't
disputed
in
this
case,
i
don't
think,
that
congress
could
have
raised
the
general
income
tax
on
everybody
5,
10
percent.
it
might
have
required...
it
might
have
been
required
to
by
economic
distress,
by
wartime.
not
only
that,
congress
could
have
imposed
what
it
has
called
from
time
to
time
a
surtax,
which
is,
you
know,
a
special
kind
of
tax
that
is
found
necessary
to
impose
from
time
to
time.
now,
that
has
the
exact
same
economic
effect
as
a...
as
the
elimination
of
the
5.4...
the
exemption
for
the
5.4
percent
for
social
security
taxes
and
the
medicare
tax,
so
i
think
it's
just
wrong
to
say
that
the
judges
had
an
enforceable
entitlement
that
required
congress
to
freeze
this
in
place,
because
their
economic
situation
could
have
been
changed
in
exactly
the
same
way.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
think
it
would
be
accurate
to
say
that
congress
realized
that
if
it
was...
if
it
extended
the
social
security
taxes...
and
we're
only
talking
about
the
old
age
tax
here.
i
mean,
the
medicare
tax
applies
to
everybody
across
the
board,
so
that's
completely
nondiscriminatory,
but
as
for
the
oasdi
tax,
if
congress
had
required
incumbent
federal
employees
to
pay
that,
they
would
have
been
subject
to
double
deductions,
and
congress
realized
that
that
in
itself
was
unfair.
that
is,
it
would
be
required
to
treat
alike
things
that
were
not,
in
fact,
alike,
so
the
fact
that
judges
had
the
guaranteed
retirement
annuity
was
a
difference
for
treating
them
differently.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
when
congress
extended
social
security
taxes
to
federal
judges
and
to
other
federal
employees
in
1984
it
had
several
objectives
that
had
to
be
balanced.
one
objective
was
to
bring
as
many
people
as
possible
within
the
social
security
system,
people
who
had
been
exempted
from
it
in
order
to
sustain
the
fiscal
soundness
of
the
system.
another
objective
was
to
treat
federal...
people
in
federal
service
similarly
in
that
each
should
be
subjected
to
one,
but
only
one,
contribution
for
retirement
income
security,
and
a
third
was,
congress
understood
that
federal
employees
in
the
civil
service
retirement
system
had
a
large
vested
interest
in
that
system,
which
had
been
in
place
since
1920,
and
that
it
would
be
extremely
disruptive
just
to
terminate
it
and
start
as
if
it
had
never
existed,
especially
because
many
federal
employees
would
not
have
been
able
to
accrue
enough
service
in
social
security
after
that
point
to
become
eligible
in
social
security,
especially
if
they
were
older.
the
federal...
the
civil
service
retirement
system
allows
retirement
at
age
55.
it
also
is
more
expensive
on
the
cost
side
for
federal
employees
than
social
security
in
some
sense,
because
the
contribution
rate
is
higher,
and
there
was
no
earnings
cap
on
social
security...
on
csrs,
as
there
was
under
the
old
age
tax
system,
so
all
of
those
factors
had
to
be
balanced.
the
point
is,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
federal
judges
joined
virtually
everybody
else
in
our
society
in
being
subject
to
a
5,
6
percent
mandatory
contribution
for
a
retirement
income
security
system,
and
that's
what
i
mean
when
i
say
that
the
overall
objective
of
congress
was
equalization,
and
that
congress
treated
them
no
differently
at
the
end
of
the
day
than
it
treated
everybody
else.
now,
it
is
true,
there
are
issues
that
come
up
in
a
transition,
as
there
are
any
time
when
congress
extended
social
security,
or
where
a
state
might
adjust...
a
state
might
adjust
an
exemption,
for
example,
the
intragovernmental
tax
immunity
system
doctrine
was
alluded
to.
well,
there
was
a
time
when
states
exempted
all
federal
employees
and
federal
contractors
from
their
taxes
because
they
thought
they
were
required
to
under
this
court's
decisions
in
collector
v.
day.
then
along
came
graves,
and
the
court
said
that
states
could
tax
federal
employees
and
federal
contractors
on
an
equal
rate.
the
states
were
required
to
adjust
their
systems,
or
had
the
opportunity
to
adjust
their
systems,
and
they
were
able
to
do
so
in
many
different
ways.
it
required
some...
it
required
a
lot
of
adjustment
because
of
the
ways
that
different
people
had
been
treated
differently,
and
this
court
has
many
cases
on
that
point,
reviewing
the
adjustments
that
the
states
made,
but
the
point
is,
the
principle
that
emerged
from
those
cases
was,
what
was
required
at
the
end
of
the
day
was
nondiscriminatory
taxation
of
those
who
dealt
with
the
federal
government,
and
that
principle
we
think
is
the
same
principle
that
should
govern
here.
that
is,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
congress
is
required
to
do
more
than
treat
federal
judges
on
par
with
the
vast
majority
of
american
citizens.
i
do
want
to
touch
on
the
termination
of
violation
point,
which
is,
even
if
we're
wrong
about
everything
that
i
just
said,
it
seems
to
me
the
only
expectation
that
judges
could
have
had
when
they
took
office
was
that
their
net
pay
would
not
have
been
reduced
below
the
level
at
which
they
took
office.
so
the
expectation...
the
expectation
that
judges
had
was
not
that
they
remain
exempt
from
social
security
taxes
in
a
kind
of
indefinite
number
that
is
just,
they
have
an
interest
in
an
exemption,
quia
exemption,
but
a
particular
number
has
to
be
put
on
that,
so
if
a
violation
did
occur,
the
violation
came
to
an
end
when
congress
brought
judges'
net
pay
back
up
above
the
highest
level
that
it
had
ever
been
at
any
earlier
time.
if
the
court
has
nothing
further--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--it's
not
just
that
judges
had
the
pension
plan.
it's
also
that
judges
didn't
have
to
pay
anything
and
everybody
else
had
to
pay
something.
all
federal
employees
also
had
to
pay
something,
so
they
were
not
brought
in
mandatorily.
thank
you.
