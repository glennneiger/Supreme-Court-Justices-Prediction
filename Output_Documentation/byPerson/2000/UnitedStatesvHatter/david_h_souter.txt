but
it
changes
the
tradeoff.
you
were
making
a
tradeoff
argument
before,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
justice
ginsburg's
question
goes
right
to
the
tradeoff,
and
if
your
tradeoff
argument
is
right,
it
seems
to
me
you've
got
to
say,
no,
it
can't...
that
tax
can't
be
imposed--
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
but
the
income
isn't.
when
i...
the
theory
of
the
tradeoff
is
that
i
go
on
the
bench,
i
take
less
money,
but
i
know
where
i
stand,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
argument
is
just
as
strong
when
the
tax
goes
on
everybody.
it's
quite
true,
i
can
go
out
and
start
earning
a
living
under
different
conditions,
but
i...
the
deal
is
being
changed.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
legislative
history,
or
any
evidence
that
might
have
been
admissible
in
this
case,
that
there
was
a
discriminatory
intent?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
that's
quite
true,
but
i
mean,
that
was
a
case
in
which
it
was...
in
effect,
it
was
easy,
because
it
was
stated
salary,
and
you
could
say,
however
you
literally
read
the
compensation
clause,
this
had
to
be
within
it.
now
we're
not
in
such
a
situation.
we're
saying,
well,
this
isn't
so
clearly
literally
within
the
core
of
the
compensation
clause,
and
maybe
one
of
our...
maybe
our
principle
criterion
ought
to
be
to
determine
whether
this
is
also
prohibited,
since
it
gets
away
from
the
core,
is
a
discrimination
criterion,
was
it
used
to
discriminate
for
purposes
of
cowing
the
judges
and
so
on,
so
the
fact
that
in
the
core
case
we
didn't
look
to
it
doesn't
mean
that
we
shouldn't
look
to
it
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
that
because
that's
what
the
intragovernmental
immunity
doctrine
means?
in
other
words,
it
was
discriminatory
as
a
matter
of
law,
rather
than
discriminatory
as
a
matter
of
intent.
so
i
guess
you
would
have
to
say,
on
that
analogy,
anything
which
is
unequal
to
the
extent
of
a
penny
is,
on
the
discrimination
criterion,
going
to
be
discriminatory
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
i
guess
that's
what
you
are
saying.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
you're
saying
for
the
10,000
exemption
just
what
you
were
saying
for
the
original
tax,
which
is
nondiscriminatory.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
