justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
figures
that
i
have
said
that
95
percent
of
those
who
were
judges
in
198...
'82,
'92...
'82...
'82,
95
percent
had
already
maxed
out,
so
as
to
that
95
percent,
this
had
the
effect
of
nothing
but
a
tax.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
at
least
the
figures
i
saw.
do
you
have
anything
to
the
contrary,
or
do
you
think
they're
not
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
think
these
figures
are
not
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
is
it
also
right
that...
is
it
also
the
case
that
when
this
was
extended
to,
let's
say...
how
many
million
in
federal
employees
were
there
in...
there
were
about,
say,
5,
10
million
federal
employees,
extended--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--a
couple
of
million,
all
right.
as...
if
there
were
2
million,
let's
say,
1,950,000
it
didn't
apply
to,
because
there
it
was
just
for
the
future.
as
to
the
remaining
50,000,
there
were
probably
less,
probably
5,000,
maybe
2,000,
it
did
apply
to
them,
but
they
were
given
the
choice
whether
to
opt
in
or
not.
but
for
800,
there
were
only
800
out
of
that
50
million,
or
5...
2
million
that
didn't...
that
had
no
choice,
that
had
to
take
it,
is
that
right,
and
those
800
were
the
federal
judges
then
sitting,
so
everybody
else
could
opt
out--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
in
fact
only
a
few
had
to
opt
out
because
it
didn't
cover
any
sitting
employee
but
for
those
few.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
the
800
judges
had
to
accept
this
social
security.
no
one
else
did.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
had
to
go
into
the
federal--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so...
all
right.
so,
but
as
to
this
particular
tax
at
issue,
the
only
ones
that
had
to
accept
it
were
the
judges
and
the
president.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
i
just
want
to
know
if
that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--isn't
that,
what
you
just
said,
totally
irrelevant,
in
that
isn't
the
issue
whether
or
not
a
person
who
was
already
employed
at
that
time
had
to
accept
it?
i'm
trying
to
just
get
the
facts
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
making
an
argument,
yet.
i
want
to
get
the
facts
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
this
is
my
question,
if
those
facts
are
right.
suppose
congress
said,
i
want
a
general
tax,
everyone
in
the
united
states
will
pay
it,
the
tax
is
equal
to
100,000
dollars
a
person.
it's
a
big
tax,
but
everybody
pays
it.
no
problem
with
that
for
judges,
right?
i'm...
the
answer
is
right,
no
problem.
okay.
now,
what
they
do
is
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no...
everybody
in
the
united
states
happens
to
get
a
rebate,
exactly
of
100,000
dollars,
or
to
make
it...
and,
by
the
way,
our
reason
for
this
is
not
to
discriminate
against
judges.
it's
that
everybody
else
in
the
united
states
doesn't
have
this
marvelous,
guaranteed,
nonpayable
in
retirement
system,
so
we're
only
leaving
out
those
who
have
this...
who
happen
to
be
judges,
of
course.
now,
a)
is
that
okay,
in
your
view,
under
the
constitution?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
not
okay,
and
i
don't
think
it
is
either,
what's
the
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
is.
the
reason
is
that
they
have,
guaranteed
by
the
constitution,
a
retirement
system,
and
no
one
else
does.
now,
is
that
a
legitimate
reason,
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no.
i
mean,
it's
easy
to
manipulate
the
hypothetical.
we
don't
call
it
100,000,
call
it
50,000,
have
it
come
out
of
the
retirement
committees
of
congress,
have
it
viewed
as
some
kind
of
effort
to
help
people
who
don't
have
guaranteed
retirement.
i
mean,
you
know,
we
could
fix
that
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
it
your
basic
point,
i
mean,
whether
you're
right
or
you're
wrong,
i
thought
it's
well-established
law
that
a
uniform
tax
applied
to
everybody
is
constitutional,
and
you
agree
with
that,
i
take
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
whether
it
fits
your
reasoning
or
whether
it
doesn't,
that's
still
the
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
we
have
two
things
here
in
addition.
one
is,
it's
not
a
uniform
tax.
it's
only
applying
to
some
people
and
not
others,
in
your
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
second
thing
is,
the
third
thing
is,
it's
not
only
not
uniform,
it
is
also
discriminatory.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
there
any
plaintiffs
still
left?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
were
just
giving
the
numbers
that
i
was
quite
interested
in.
i'm
sorry--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
right
numbers.
that
is
to
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--before
you
tell
me
the
numbers--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
it
right
to
this?
i'm
trying
to
think
of
people
in
the
federal
government
who
get
a
paycheck
once
a
month.
now,
most
of
these
people
don't
have
as
good
a
retirement
program
as
judges,
so
it's
already...
that
paycheck
is
right
there.
it's
already
reflecting
a
great
thing
for
judges,
okay.
now,
we
look
at
that
paycheck.
now,
i
want
to
know...
i'm
just
thinking,
some
people
will
get
a
smaller
one
because
of
social
security.
other
people
won't
get
a
smaller
one
at
all
than
they
had
been
getting.
okay,
i
want
to
know
who's
getting
a
smaller
one
than
they
had
been
getting,
and
who
is
getting
the
same
one
they
had
been
getting?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
be
clear.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
2-1/2
million.
800
of
those,
namely
the
federal
judges,
plus
the
president,
are
getting
a
smaller
paycheck.
nobody
else
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
contrary
to
what
the
sg
just
said,
because
the
sg
just
said
there
are
also
some
people
in
congress.
now,
who
are
those
people?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying,
as
of
the
date
that
this
took
effect,
there
might
have
been
some
people
in
congress
who
were
not
already
having
a
deduction
from
their
paycheck,
but
you
believe
that
number
is
zero.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
it
is
more
than
zero,
it's
very
small.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
the
word
discrimination
applicable
here
or
not?
my
check
is
200
dollars
smaller
this
month.
no
one
else's
is
but
for
judges
and
four
other
people,
and
the
reason
is
not
that
they
don't
like
my
opinion.
the
reason
is
because
i
have
a
constitutionally
guaranteed
pension,
something
that
judges
only
have.
now,
those
are
the
facts.
is
that
discrimination?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
a
sense,
it's
not,
because
they're
not
doing
it
because
they
don't
like
my
opinion.
in
a
sense
it
is,
because
they're
picking
on
a
characteristic
that
belongs
only
to
judges.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
yes,
as
long
as
you're
at
it,
the
part
that
was
bothering
me
was
not
the
part,
treating
judges
the
same.
it
was
the
part
of
treating
judges
differently.
so
what...
i
mean,
they're
treated
differently
in
that
everybody
else
is
allowed
to
opt
out
but
judges.
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
reason
is
clear,
i
guess.
they
weren't
angry.
they
didn't
dislike
our
opinions.
it's
just
that
they
thought
judges
already
have
this
pension
plan,
which
is
perfect.
that's
why
they
did
it.
but
that
only
applied--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
first
case
united
sates
versus
hatter.
the
federal
constitutionâ€™s
compensation
clause
guarantees
federal
judges
a
compensation,
which
shall
not
be
diminished
during
their
continuance
in
office.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
this
clause
prevents
the
government
from
collecting
medicare
and
social
security
taxes
from
a
small
number
of
judges
who
held
office
about
20
years
ago
before
congress
extended
the
taxes
to
federal
employees.
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
about
the
medicare
taxes.
the
court
of
appeals
struck
down
the
medicare
tax
on
the
authority
of
a
case
called
evans
versus
gore,
a
1920's
case,
which
held
that
congress
could
not
include
sitting
judges
within
the
scope
of
what
was
then
a
brand
new
federal
income
tax
law.
although
the
court
of
appeals
could
not
overrule
that
case
because
it
is
a
supreme
court
case,
we
believe
that
subsequent
developments
of
undermine
the
case
to
the
point
where
it
is
no
longer
good
law,
we
consequently
overrule
evans,
and
we
hold
that
the
compensation
clause
does
not
forbid
congress
from
enacting
a
law
that
imposes
a
nondiscriminatory
tax,
which
includes
an
increase
in
rates
or
a
change
in
conditions
upon
judges
like
everybody
else
whether
those
judges
were
appointed
before
or
after
the
tax
law,
in
question,
was
enacted
or
took
affect.
because
the
extension
of
the
medicare
tax
to
the
judges
in
this
case
was
nondiscriminatory,
we
uphold
its
validity.
congress'
extension
of
the
social
security
tax
to
the
judges
is
a
different
matter.
as
if
the
time
of
extension
the
early
1980's,
all
federal
employees
had
remained
outside
the
social
security
system
for
nearly
50
years.
when
in
the
law
that
we
are
here
considering,
congress
extended
the
social
security
tax
to
judges,
it
exempted
all
the
federal
employees
who
were
then
federal
employees
from
the
new
system
with
an
exception,
and
the
exception
was
people
who
were
then
federal
employees
if
they
fell
into
the
category
of
members
of
congress,
high-level
executive
branch
employees,
judges,
and
a
handful
of
others.
but
then
looking
at
those
people
within
the
exemption,
it
made
an
exemption
from
the
exemption,
and
except
for
judges
it
offset
the
new
social
security
tax
by
reducing
other
pension
payment
obligations
to
the
point
where
individual
employee
payroll
deductions
remained
about
the
same
that
is
they
got
the
same
sized
pay
check.
the
result
was
a
significant
adverse
financial
impact
not
upon
everybody
else
in
the
class,
but
upon
judges
and
upon
judges
virtually
alone
in
this
respect,
that
is
because
they
were
in
the
exception
to
the
exception.
upon
close
examination,
we
find
that
the
justification
the
government
advances
for
that
differential
in
our
view
is
not
sound.
we
explain
why
this
is
so
in
our
opinion.
we
conclude
that
the
special
way
in
which
congress
applied
the
social
security
tax
to
judges
compared
to
all
other
federal
employees
discriminated
against
the
judges
and
in
our
view
the
compensation
clause
forbids
that
kind
of
discrimination.
our
holding
does
not
apply
to
later
appointed
judges
i
might
add
such
as
ourselves
who
do
have
to
pay
the
tax.
we
also
hold
that
congress
did
not
cure
the
problem
when
later
it
raised
the
judgesâ€™
nominal
pay.
those
later
nominal
pay
increases
partly
offset,
partly
offset,
the
erosion
of
real
pay
levels
due
to
inflation.
they
were
not
meant
to
help
those
few
pre
1980
judges
overcome
the
problem
that
we
just
described.
in
sum,
we
hold
that
the
compensation
clause
does
not
prevent
congress
from
imposing
a
nondiscriminatory
tax
laid
generally
upon
judges
and
other
citizens,
but
it
does
prohibit
taxation
that
singles
out
judges
for
especially
unfavorable
treatment.
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
in
part
and
affirm
in
part.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part;
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
justice
stevens
and
justice
o'connor
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
