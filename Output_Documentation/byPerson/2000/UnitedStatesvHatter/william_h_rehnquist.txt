we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
99-1978,
united
states
v.
terry
j.
hatter.
mr.
wolfson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
cases
support
the...
your
second
hypothesis?
we've
had
cases
involving,
you
know,
the
compensation
clause
and
decided
them
one
way
or
the
other,
but
what
cases
support
this
second
line
of
argument?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
quite...
it's
actually
quite
different
from
other
compensation
schemes,
where
you
get
out
what
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--a
fraction
of
what
you
paid
in.
social
security,
you
can
go
for
just
a
few
quarters
and
get
the
whole
deal,
and
pay
60
years
and
get
nothing
more.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
could
say
that
congress
did
have
a
focus
on
the
judiciary
here,
since
judges
weren't
included
until
1983,
and
then
it
was
decided
to
bring
judges
in,
who
had
not
been
in
before.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
many
judges,
speaking
generally,
had
already
qualified
for
the
social
security
system
in
private
practice.
--many
judges...
many
judges
might
have,
mr.
chief
justice.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
wolfson.
mr.
rosenthal,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
authority
in
our
cases
is
there
for
either
of
those,
mr.
rosenthal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
a
judge
who
has
served...
this
is
perhaps
a
rather...
a
very
old
judge,
who
was
serving
in
'37.
when
they
came
in,
they're
exempted,
so
unlike
the
rest
of
the
population
the
judge
gets
a
benefit
that
the
rest
of
the
population
doesn't
get.
then
he
continues
to
serve
until
1982.
then
the
exemption
is
taken
away.
now,
he's
in
no
worse
shape
now
than
he
was
when
he
went
on
the
bench
in
1936.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
a
change
in
the
tax
rate?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me
that's
really
stretching
article
iii.
i
mean,
it's
a
perfectly
good
policy
reason,
but
i
don't
think
our
cases
have...
at
least
in
their
holdings
haven't
extended
article
iii
to
that
length.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
hamilton's
not
a
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
o'malley
casts
some
doubt
on
evans
against
gore,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
think
it
does
cut
against
your
tradeoff
argument.
a
judge
can
go
on
the
bench,
no
income
tax
anywhere,
saying,
i'm
getting
100,000
a
year
for
this
job,
i've
got
so
many
kids
to
educate,
i
can
just
make
it
the
way
it
is,
and
i'm
willing
to
sacrifice
whatever
i
would
have...
more
i
would
have
made
in
the
profession.
but
then
the
tax
comes
along
and
the
tradeoff,
what
he
had
bargained
for
is
no
longer
there.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
poison
example
depends
on
the
idea
that
judges
are
addicted
to
money.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
given
the
present
state
of
judicial
salaries
you
really
can't
say
that,
i
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
were
required
to
join
that
or
something
else.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
we
get
outside
the
compensation
clause,
several
recent
congressional
pay
raises
in
1989
gave
district
judges
a
higher
percentage
pay
raise
than
court
of
appeals
judges,
court
of
appeals
judges
a
higher
percentage
pay
raise
than
supreme
court
justices.
now,
would
that
be
grounds
for
saying
that
maybe
congress
had
it
in
for
the
supreme
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
not,
under
your
theory?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rosenthal.
mr.
wolfson,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wolfson.
the
case
is
submitted.
