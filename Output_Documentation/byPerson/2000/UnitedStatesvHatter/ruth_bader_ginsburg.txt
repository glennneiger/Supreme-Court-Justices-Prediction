and
you
could
be...
you
can
be
a
bachelor,
or
you
could
have
nine
children,
and
it
would
be
the
same.
it's
a
tax.
it's
not
like
the
civil
service
retirement
system
that's
also
a
piece
of
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
a
tax.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wolfson,
do
i
understand
your
argument
to
be
essentially,
this
is
no
different
than
if
congress
had
initially
given
federal
judges
an
exemption
from
income
tax,
and
they
enjoy
that
exemption...
say,
a
judge
when
he
took
office
got
that
exemption.
10
years
later,
the
congress
decides
that
judges
shouldn't
be
exempt
from
the
federal
income
tax,
so
puts
it
on.
now,
we
decided
a
case
that
deals
with
the
prospective
aspect
of
it
and
said
that's
okay
if
someone
was
coming
on
the
bench,
once
the
tax
is
in.
we
didn't
decide
the
part
that
says,
what
about
people
who
are
already
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
your
view
that
these
two
cases
are
the
same?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
okay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
would
you
say
on
that
reasoning
that
when
the
social
security
tax
came
in
and
everybody
in
the
general
population
was
exposed
to
it,
and
the
judges
were
not,
that
the
judges'
compensation
went
up,
they
had
an
increase...
they
had
an
increase
in
compensation,
therefore,
that
couldn't
be
decreased
later
on.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
would
have
to
say
that,
that
exempting
them
from
the
tax
increased
their
compensation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
they
couldn't
diminish
the
compensation,
and
this
is
a
diminution,
you
argue--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--then
equally,
it
had
to
be
an
augmentation
when
the
social
security
first
came
in
and
the
judges
were
exempt
from
it.
if
it
didn't
increase
their
salary,
how
did
it
decrease
their
salary?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
that
was
involved
in
o'malley
is
it
was
somebody
who
came
on
board--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--after
the
tax,
so
the
court
didn't
have
to
deal
with
somebody
who
was
already
a
judge
when
the
tax
came
on,
but
is
your--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
think
i
grasp
your
argument
correctly
that
you
would
say,
if
the...
there
is
no
income
tax,
and
there
are
sitting
judges,
and
then
congress
puts
an
income
tax
on
the
general
population,
everybody,
you
can't
put
it
on
the
judges
who
were
appointed
to
the
bench
before
the
tax
came
in.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i'm
deciding
whether
to
take
a
judgeship.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
there's
no
tax
on
my
income.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right,
and
then
i
take
the
bench,
and
they...
but
i
know
what
my
salary
is.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
there
is
a
tax.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
imposed
on
everybody,
so
my
take-home
pay
is
less,
because
of
this
tax.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
were
already
having
a
bigger
bite
taken
out
for
the
cr...
the
civil
service
retirement
was
a
larger
percentage
of
their
salary
than
the
social
security
would
be.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
you
were
socking
them
with
social
security
on
top
of
the
7
percent
for
civil
service,
and
then
putting
5.7...
i
think
those
employees
would
say,
we've
been
discriminatorily
impacted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
saying
the
second
tax
is
no
good,
either,
then...
as
i
understand
it...
or
are
you
just
saying
the
oasdi?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
then
to
that
extent
you're
saying,
congress
has
a
choice.
either
it
taxes...
it
gives
no
exemption,
ever,
to
judges,
because
if
it
gives
them
an
exemption,
it
can
never
take
it
away,
so
it's
got
to
treat
judges...
it
can't
give
them
preferential
treatment,
in
other
words,
if
it
gives
them
preferential
treatment,
that
it's
stuck
with
that,
but
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--explain
how
that...
you've
answered
my
question,
did
the
judge's
compensation
go
up
when
everybody
else
was
exposed
to
this
tax
and
the
judges
weren't,
and
you
resisted
saying
that
yes,
they
got
an
increase
in
compensation,
even
though
their
salary
remained
the
same.
