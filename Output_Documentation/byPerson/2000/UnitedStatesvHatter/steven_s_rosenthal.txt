mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
that
the
court
determined
the
liability
issues
in
1996
and
need
not
reach
them
now,
but
if
this
court
does
reach
the
liability
issues,
we
believe
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
a
tax
can
ever
be
a
diminution
in
judicial
compensation.
we
contend
that
it
can
in
at
least
two
circumstances.
circumstance
number
1
is
where
congress
or
the
political
branches
change
the
economic
tradeoff
that
a
judge
makes
when
assuming
the
bench,
and
secondly,
where
congress
discriminates
against
federal
judges.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
well,
with
respect
to
the
discrimination,
the
latter,
virtually
every
one
of
these
cases,
especially
the
woodrow
case,
refers
to
a
nondiscriminatory
tax.
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
the
tradeoff,
the
tradeoff
is
derived
from
both
will
and
evans,
which
refer
to
the
fact
that
one
of
the
primary
purposes,
an
equal
purpose
of
the
clause,
was
to
bring
judges...
bring
qualified
judges
into
the
judiciary.
to
quote
alexander
hamilton,
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
clause
was
to
get
people
with
the
requisite
knowledge,
combined
with
the
requisite
integrity.
that
was
a
primary
purpose,
as
he
indicated
in
federalist
78.
therefore,
the
purpose
was
so
that...
and
i'm
again
quoting
hamilton.
it
was
so
that
a
man
knew
what
ground
he
stood
on,
and
the
ground
that
these
judges
stood
on
was,
they
didn't
get...
they
got
a
lot
of
disadvantages,
your
honors,
from
when
they
became
federal
judges,
but
one
of
the
small
advantages
they
did
get
was,
all
of
the
plaintiffs
were
free
from
oasdi
and
hi,
and
that
was
retroactively
changed.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
well--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--well,
i
would
prefer
to
say
it
the
other
way.
our
view
is
that
compensation
refers,
justice
ginsburg,
to
what's
available
for
the
support
and
sustenance
of
a
judge.
when
our
clients,
when
these
plaintiffs
took
office
they
had
available
to
them
the
stated
salary,
but
the
stated
salary
without
a
deduction
for
oasdi
and
hi,
and--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--yes.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
well,
i...
i'm
not
sure
how
i
answer
the
question
about
whether
it
was...
the
exemption
constituted
an
increase.
it
may
have,
but
it's
quite
clear
to
me
that
the
imposition
of
the
tax
definitely
constituted
a
decrease,
and
this
was
a
policy
decision,
justice
ginsburg,
that
was
made
by
congress
in
1935.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
your
honor,
that
is
admittedly
not
this
particular
case.
what
that
is
is
actually
the
evidence
case
itself.
that
was
a
case
in
which
the
judge
took
office
before
the
tax
was
imposed
on
the
general
public.
our
position
is
that
the...
that
a
general
rate
increase
which
is
uniform
for
the
entire
population
does
not...
and
applies
to
everybody,
does
not
change
judicial
compensation,
and
although
we
believe
that
the
principle
of
evidence
is
correct,
we
believe
there
is
a
possibility,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
particular
facts
of
evidence
might
have
been
different,
depending
on
whether
evans
was
appointed
in
1912
or
1915.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
no.
your
honor,
if
it's
a
uniform
change
in
the
tax
rate,
that
doesn't
go
to
the
purpose
of
the
clause.
what
we're
looking
for
are
changes
in
taxation
which
will
induce
justices
who
are
in
office
to
leave
office,
or
lead
potential
candidates
not
to
join
the
bench.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
well,
i
think,
with
respect,
i
think
that
a
fair
reading
of
hamilton...
hamilton's--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--no,
i
understand,
it's
not
a
case.
but
in
reality,
the
only
case
that
is
here,
the
only
case
which
has
dealt
with
this
issue
is
evans
v.
gore,
and
evans
v.
gore
might
have
used
broader
language,
but
it
didn't
deal
with
this
particular
case.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
on
the
broad
reasoning
of
evans
v.
gore,
but
o'malley
does...
because
the
court
overturned
miles
but
didn't
overturn
evans,
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
this
court's
case
law,
reading
the
three
cases
together,
is
that
the
principle
we're
advocating,
a
change
for
a
sitting
judge
in...
that
changes
the
economic
tradeoff,
is
prohibited
by
the
compensation
clause.
that's
the
principle
we
derive
from
reading
those
three
clauses
together,
and
i--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--after--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
no,
that
isn't...
our
position
is,
this
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
that
question.
our
position
is
that
if
congress
were
to
adopt
a
new
tax
today,
and
were
to
impose
it
uniformly
on
both
judges
and
nonjudges,
there
would
be
no
incentive
for
a
judge
to
want
to
leave
the
bench.
there
would
have
been
no
disincentive
for
him
going
on
to
the
bench.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
well,
i
may
have
misunderstood
justice
ginsburg's
question.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
yes.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
in
the
private
sector
or
on
the
bench.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
imposed
on--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--i
would
submit,
justice
ginsburg,
that
on
that
fact
pattern
there
is
no
incentive
to
leave
the
bench
because
the
tax
is
the
same
on
both
sides
of
the
equals
sign.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
our
position
is
that,
although
that
additional
category
might
be
covered,
we
don't
need
to
reach
that
question
in
this
case.
at
least
in
our
view
of
the
tradeoff,
justice
souter,
we
don't
need
to
deal
with
a
case
where
there
is
a
uniform
change
in
rates
or
a
uniform
change
in--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--well,
your
honor,
i
understand
that
position.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
well,
i
think
the
imposition
of...
this
court
held
in
evans
v.
gore
and
that
the
imposition
of
a
new
tax
does
violate
the
compensation
clause.
we
don't
reach
that
issue
because
we
have
a
more
limited
circumstance.
we
have
a
case
where
judges
take
office
during
a
50-year
period
in
which
congress
had
a
policy
in
effect
that
a
tax
would
not
be
applied.
this
is
not
a
transitory
issue,
i
might
add.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
and
if
it
did...
if
it
did
repeal
the
tax
on
everybody
else
and
left
it
in
effect--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--well--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--well,
you
would
have
to
be
adversely
affected
by
the
tradeoff,
not
advantageously.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
look--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--we
agree
with--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--we
agree
that
a
uniform
imposition
of
a
tax,
a
uniform
change
of
tax--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--that's
correct.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
and
if
i
could...
because
i
don't
want
to
lose
the
discriminatory
point,
let
me
provide
you
the
facts,
because
i've
been
involved
in
this
case
for
12
years.
first
of
all,
of
the
federal
employees--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--thank
god,
there
are.
we
have...
we
had
2-1/2
million,
approximately,
federal
employees
to
whom
this
tax
was
not
applied.
those
were
incumbent
federal
employees
who
were
not
required
to
join
oasdi.
that
represented
99-1/2
percent--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--no,
actually,
they
were
already
in
csrs,
and
they
were
allowed
to
simply
stay
where
they
were,
but
they
were
not
required
to
join
oasdi.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
i
believe--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--all
of
that,
i...
we
view
as
being
form
over
substance,
because...
well,
because
the
government
sets
the
salaries
and
then
takes
6,
7,
8
percent
out.
they
could
have
just
as
easily
have
set
the
salary
at
the
lower
level
and
said,
we
give
you
this
benefit,
which
is
what
they
did
with
judges.
instead
of
saying,
you
get
paid
x
dollars
and
we
take
out
10
percent
for
your
retirement
annuity,
they
simply
set
the
salary
and
say
you
get
the
retirement
annuity.
we
view
that
as
essentially
artificial.
it's
just...
the
fact
that
it's
taken
out
is
just
a
matter
of
the
semantics
of
the
way
the
statute
was
enacted.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
let
me
give
you
the
numbers--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--your
honor.
2-1/2,
90--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
i'm
happy
to
answer
that
question.
the
article
iii
judges
and
the
president
of
the
united
states
are
in
that
category.
the...
in
the
reply
brief,
the
government
for
the
first
time
in
this
litigation
suggested
that
there
might
be
a
small
component
of
congressional
employees
that
might
also
be
in
that
category.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
yes.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
that
is
correct.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
well,
there
was
a
theoretical
possibility
that
you
had
not
been
in
csrs
before,
and
the
government
for
the
first
time
in
the
reply
brief
raised
this
issue.
i've
done
some
inquiries,
and
i
am
informed
that
that
set
of
people
who
did
not
elect
csrs
is
either
very
few
or
none
at
all,
and
the
reason
for
that
is,
it
was
almost
irrational
not
to
elect
csrs
because
it's
refundable,
so
if
you
were
a
youngster
who
was
just
out
of
school
and
went
to
work
for
congress
in
199...
1983,
you
elect
csrs
because
2
years
later
you
can
get
the
money
back.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
zero
or--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--it's
very
small,
your
honor.
but
of
the
2-1/2...
of
the
2-1/2
million,
we're
talking
about,
a
number
in
the
three
digits
or
the
low
four
digits.
the
fact
is...
and
that
is
the
basis
of
our
discrimination
argument,
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
election
that
was
given
was
not
just
given
once,
it
was
given
three
times,
so
if
you
were
fool
enough
to
miss
it
the
first
time,
you
were
given
a
number
of
opportunities
to
opt
out
of
the
deduction
from
your
salary,
and
that
is
the
basis
for
our
discrimination
argument.
the
government
says,
oh,
we
have
a
rationale
for
discrimination,
and
that
is
equalization.
i
would
answer
that,
number
1,
this
court's
decision
in
the
will
case
said,
equalization
can't
justify
a
diminution,
because
the
government
made
the
same
argument
in
will.
they
said,
oh,
we
lowered
federal
judges'
salaries,
but
we
were
lowering
all
federal
employees'
salaries
at
the
same
time,
and
this
court
said,
equalization
can't
be
a
rationale.
but
secondly,
the
fact
is
that
it
doesn't
take
a
very
creative
legislature
to
come
up
with
some
reasonably
sounding
rationale
to
justify
a
diminution
in
a
particular
case,
and
equalization,
which
is
an
argument
concocted...
excuse
me,
an
argument
presented
by
the
solicitor
general's
office,
nowhere
appears
in
the
legislative
history
of
any
of
these
statutes.
there's
nothing...
this
equalization
doctrine,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
is
nothing
that
appears
in
the
statute
or
in
its
legislative
history.
they
didn't
say,
we
need
to
tax
federal
judges
because
we
need
equalization.
we
think,
at
a
bare
minimum,
for
this
argument
to
be
honored
by
this
court,
at
least
congress
ought
to
say,
we
wanted
to
equalize
federal
judges.
we
still
don't
think
it's
constitutional,
but--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--no,
and
this
court
has
never
required
discriminatory
intent.
in
will,
recall,
justice
souter,
there
was
an
increase
for
a
mere
12
hours,
and
then
the
salaries
dropped
back
down
again.
there
was
no
fleeing
from
the
federal
judiciary.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
if
i
could
suggest
a
case
which
i
think
is
quite
analogous,
and
that's
davis
v.
michigan
department
of
revenue.
as
the
court
may
recall,
that
was
a
case
in
which
state
employees
were
exempted...
state
retirees
were
exempted
from
a
tax
on
their
retirement
benefits.
federal
employees
and
the
rest
of
the
michigan
public
had
to
pay
income
taxes
on
retirement
benefits.
this
court
held,
under
the
intragovernmental
immunity
doctrine,
that
that
was
discriminatory.
there
was
no
intent
to
discriminate
against
federal
employees.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
i
think
that
is
what
we're
saying,
and
obviously
the
penny...
i
mean,
if
there
were
a
penny
drop
in
stated
salary,
that
obviously
would
be
unconstitutional,
but
we
infer
the
intent
from
the
facts.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
no,
your
honor.
i
mean--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--well,
because
first
of
all
we're
dealing...
all
of
those
cases
are
by
common
consent
increases,
and
this
court's
holding
in
various
cases
give
congress
very
broad
power
when
one
is
dealing
with
an
increase.
the
discretion
with
congress
is
how
much
to
increase.
there
is
no
dispute...
there
is
a
factual
finding
by
a
rather
unsympathetic
trial
court
that
there
was
a
reduction
in
our
salary
in
this
case.
there
was
a
reduction
in
take-home
pay,
so
we're
dealing
here
with
a
reduction
in
take-home
pay,
and
the
question
in
this
case
is,
was
it
an
unconstitutional
reduction?
so
we
distinguish
it
from
cases
where
there
are
different
levels
of
increase,
where,
frankly,
political
factors
do
play
a
role,
but
that
was
a
decision
made
by
the
framers,
that
when
you
deal
with
increase
congress
has
a
much
greater
role
than
with
a
decrease,
where
a
prophylactic
rule
has
to
be--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--well--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--well,
i
agree--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--well,
i
think
the
word
discrimination
is
used
to
cover
a
number
of
things.
it
doesn't
necessarily,
justice
breyer,
just
include
an
intent
by
congress.
it
includes
exactly
the
circumstance
you're
describing,
in
which
a
distinction
is
made
between
federal
judges.
suppose
the
distinction
weren't
merely
based
on
the
pension,
but
the
fact
that
we
think
you
should
get
less
because
you've
got
a
lifetime
job
and
everyone
else
holds
their
job
at
the
pleasure
of
the
president
of
the
united
states.
any
factor
that
inheres
peculiarly
within
the
judiciary,
and
is
a
basis
for
a
distinction,
i
think
could
also
be
a
basis
for
finding
discrimination.
in
other
words
it
covers
a
broad
mix
of
factors.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
no.
this
would
only
apply
to
the
oasdi.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
we
agree
with
that.
the
hi
was
more
universal.
our
first
argument
about
the
tradeoff
would
have
to
apply
to
the--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--the
discrimination
argument,
justice
ginsburg,
only
applies
to
the
oasdi,
because
it
doesn't
apply
to
the
hi.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
if
i
could
just
give
you
an
analogy,
suppose
congress
next
year,
instead
of
providing
an
increase
in
stated
salaries,
said,
all
judges
can
take
10,000
dollars
tax-free,
10,000
dollars
of
their
income
is
tax-free.
i
point
out
this
is
not
so
unusual.
congress
for
a
number
of
years
gave
the
president
50,000
dollars
for
expenses
tax-free.
i
would
submit
that
becomes
part
of
a
judge's
compensation,
and
congress...
the
congress
can't,
10
years
later,
decide
to
take
it
away.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
i
resist
it
because
exemption
from
a
tax...
i
think
now
that
i've
used
my
hypothetical,
i
think
if
there
were
at
least
one
directed
to
judges,
if
there
were
an
exemption,
that
might
be
interpreted
to
be
an
increase
in--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--if
it
were
uniform
throughout
the
united
states,
we're
not
contending
that
that
would
constitute
a
diminution--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--because,
at
least
on
the
discriminatory
point,
it
wouldn't
be
discriminatory.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
but
i--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--i
admit
that
these
represent
close
cases,
but
our
position...
first
of
all,
it's
not
this
particular
case,
but
moreover,
i
think
changes
in
taxing,
if
they
were
uniform
and
taken
away
from
judges,
my
inclination
is
not
to
be
arguing
here
that
that's
part
of
compensation.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
yes.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
let
me
briefly
touch
on
the
last
point,
the
claim
of
the
government
that
this
increase
was
terminated
by
subsequent
increases.
our
position
is
very
simple.
a
congressional
action
doesn't
remedy
or
terminate
an
unconstitutional
diminution
if
the
judge's
compensation
is
the
same,
unless
it
is
the
same
as
it
would
have
been
but
for
the
unconstitutional
diminution.
we
are
subscribing
to
a
but-for
test.
it's
quite
clear
that
the
increases
that
took
place
after
oasdi
and
hi
were
imposed
were
general
cost-of-living
increases
that
applied
not
just
to
judges
but
to
broad
categories
of
federal
employees.
we
would
have
gotten
those
anyway,
and
in
that
circumstance
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
those
terminated
or
remedied
our
particular
diminution
in
this
particular
case.
we
do
contend,
however,
that
if
congress
were
to
provide
us
with
the
amount
of
our
diminution
plus
interest,
that
would
compensate
us
for
past
periods.
we
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
federal
circuit
and
hold
that
in
order
to
vindicate
both
the
text,
which
we
believe
is
clearly
applicable
in
this
particular
case,
and
the
purposes
of
the
compensation
clause,
that
the
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
the
relief
that's
ordered.
