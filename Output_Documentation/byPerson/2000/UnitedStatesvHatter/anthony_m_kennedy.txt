--well,
under
that
same
reasoning,
if
the
judges
take
office
and
there's
no
tax
for
social
security,
and
there's
a
social
security
tax
on
everybody
else,
under
that
reasoning,
if
congress
decides
to
repeal
the
social
security
tax
on
everybody
else,
the
tradeoff
has
now
been
changed
as
well.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
so...
even
if
the
judges
still
don't
pay
it,
they're
still
in
a
less
advantageous
position
vis-a-vis
everybody
else
under
your
tradeoff
argument.
congress
can't
repeal
the
tax
on
anybody
else,
either--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--without
violating
your
tradeoff
theory.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you're
still
disadvantaged
vis-a-vis
the
public
where
you...
compared
to
what
it
was
when
you
took
the
bench.
