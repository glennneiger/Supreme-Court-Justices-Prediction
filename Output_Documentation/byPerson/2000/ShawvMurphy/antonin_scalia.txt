justice
antonin
scalia
can
we
take
it
as
a
given
that
this
was
insolent
language,
because,
you
know,
i'm
somewhat
dubious
whether
this
was
insolent
language,
but
that's
a
given
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
had
the
opportunity
to
contest
that?
he
could--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
don't
have
to
go
that
far
in
this
case,
nor
do
we.
i
mean,
really,
all
you're
asserting
in
this
case
is
that
normal
prison
regulations,
including
those
against
displaying
insolence
towards
the
prison
guards,
do
not
become
suspended
when
there
are
communications
involving
legal
representation.
isn't
that
as
far
as
we
would
have
to
go
in
order
to
give
you
all
that
you're
interested
in
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
meant
that
it
encourages
the
recipient
to
become
confrontational
with
the
guards.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does
that
also?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
but
that's
not
what
you
meant
by
its
confrontational
aspect.
then
i
share
justice
souter's
perplexity.
i
don't
understand
who
he's
confronting.
i
mean,
i
can
understand
how
it's
not
good
for
prison
discipline
to
allow
prisoners
to
incite
one
another
against
the
guards.
if
that's
what
you're
talking
about,
it
makes
sense,
but
how
one
letter
from
one
prisoner
to
another
prisoner
confronts
the
prison
guards,
that's
beyond
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
do
have
control
over
the
prisoners.
justice
antonin
scalia
more
or
less.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
would
be
based
on
that
same
thing.
i
mean,
what
would
an
as-applied
challenge
be
based
on
unless
it
is
the
fact
that
in
fact
this
regulation
wasn't
violated?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
he
raise
that
question
below?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
take
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
is
going
to
whether
the
regulation
was
violated,
whether
this
particular
communication
was,
indeed,
insolence
towards
the
guard.
isn't
that
perfectly
explicable
as
raising
the
issue
of
whether
the
regulation
was
violated?
justice
antonin
scalia
turner
v.
safley
dealt
with
a
constitutional
right,
i
mean,
you
know,
the
right
to
marry,
and
you
know,
rested
on
the
proposition
that
it
is
settled
that
a
prison
inmate
retains
those
constitutional
rights
that
are
not
inconsistent
with
his
status
as
a
prisoner.
once
you've
acknowledged
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
provide
legal
advice
to
another
prisoner,
which
was
the
question
presented,
how
does
turner
v.
safley
come
into
play?
justice
antonin
scalia
now
you
have
me
confused.
i
thought
you
acknowledged,
in
response
to
justice
o'connor,
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
assist
another
state
prison
inmate
with
a
pending
court
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you'd
be
happy
to
be
thrown
back
into
the
briar
patch,
essentially,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there
are
many
other
imaginative
solutions
of
this
case
that
can
be
devised,
i
suppose,
and
this
would
knock
off
one
of
them,
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
get
it
expunged
later.
i
mean,
this
is
a
strange
manner
of
litigating,
that
you
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
that
something
that's
been
done
to
you
was
unlawful,
and
then
bring
a
second
suit
to
undo
what
was
done
to
you
because
it
has
been
declared
to
be
unlawful.
i
don't
understand
it.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
conditions
for
a
declaratory
judgment
exist
when
it
is...
i
mean,
it
is
equitable
relief,
and
i'm
not
sure
a
court
should
provide
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--when
there
is
available
to
you
legal
relief
that
will
give
full
satisfaction
to
your
client.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
understand
that.
that's
equitable,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
think
that
a
court
ought
to
give
that
if
you
don't
care
enough
about
what's
happened
to
you
to
seek
to
have
that
undone.
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
respond
to
the
last
point?
was
there
any
manner
in
which
this
litigant
could
have
gotten
the
allegedly
unlawful
imposition
of
discipline
undone
through
the
courts?
was
there
no
means
by
which
that
could
have
been
done?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
would
that
proceed?
he'd
challenge
it
before
the
prison
administration
and,
if
it
was
rejected
by
the
prison
administration,
then
he
would
go
where?
surely
the
state
court,
i
assume
he
could
have
gone.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
about
federal
court?
