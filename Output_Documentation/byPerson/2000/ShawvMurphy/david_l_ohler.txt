mr.
david
l.
ohler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
an
inmate
has
a
freestanding
right
to
provide
legal
assistance
to
another
inmate
which
entitles
correspondence
from
that
inmate
to
special
protection
under
the
first
amendment.
with
respect
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
question
may
be
phrased--
mr.
david
l.
ohler
--i
don't
believe
they
are,
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
believe
the
respondent
in
his
brief
at
page
10
indicated
that
mr.
murphy
did
not
seek
expungement
of
the
disciplinary
action
that
was
taken
against
him.
we
believe,
and
with
respect
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
question
may
be
whether
an
inmate
can
evade
censorship
of
communication
and
discipline
for
insolent
language
contained
in
a
letter
to
another
inmate
which
also
contains
legal
advice.
if
an
inmate
does
not
have
a
free--
mr.
david
l.
ohler
--we
believe
it's
a
given.
we
don't
believe
that
mr.
murphy
contested
whether
or
not
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
find
that
he
was
insolent,
and
in
fact--
mr.
david
l.
ohler
--he
did,
your
honor,
and
as
i
indicated
to
the
question
from
justice
o'connor,
he
has
not
sought
expungement
of
that
disciplinary
infraction.
if
an
inmate
does
not
have
a
freestanding
right
to
receive
legal
assistance,
as
this
court
stated
in
lewis
v.
casey,
then
the
corollary
must
be
true,
an
inmate
does
not
have
a
freestanding
right
to
render
legal
assistance.
it
is
petitioners'
position
that
legal
advice
is
entitled
to
no
greater
protection
than
speech
in
general
in
a
prison
context.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
that
is
the
position
of
the
united
states,
and
that
is
a
position
that
we
disagree
with.
it's
our
position
that
once
the
cloak
of
special
protection
is
removed
from
the
legal
advice,
the
legal
advice
privilege
as
we
termed
it
in
the
brief,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
legal
advice
under
the
turner
analysis,
or
whether
or
not
the
prison's
disciplinary
policy
under
the
turner
analysis
is
reasonably
related
to
a
legitimate
penalogical
interest,
and
we
believe
it
is.
once
that
determination
has
been
made,
that
the
policy
is
valid
and,
in
fact,
the
respondent
has
conceded
that,
he's
not
contested
the
facial
validity
of
that
policy,
but
once
the
validity
of
that
policy
under
turner
is
determined,
then
the
only
question,
we
believe,
is
whether
or
not
mr.
murphy
in
fact
violated
the
policy
and,
as
i
mentioned
to
justice
scalia's
question,
he
has
not
raised
that
question,
and
that's
a
due
process
question
that
was
not
raised
below.
in
turner
itself
the
court
did
not
distinguish
between
legal
communications
and
other
types
of
communication
between
inmates,
and
there
is
no
logical
reason
why
legal
communication
should
be
entitled
to
any
different
standard
of
review
than
other
types
of
speech,
including
political
speech.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
well,
in
this
case,
and
this
case
is
an
example,
perhaps,
of
the
hypothetical
you
pose,
but
mr.
murphy
had
the
opportunity
in
this
case
to
communicate
to
the
inmate
tracy.
he
could
have
provided
the
legal
advice
that
was
contained
in
the
letter,
don't
plead
guilty,
have
your
attorney
get
a
hold
of
me,
i've
got
some
information.
inmate
murphy
went
beyond
that
and--
mr.
david
l.
ohler
--with
respect
to
inmate-to-inmate
communications
it's
our
position,
no,
that
there
is
no
right
for
inmate-to-inmate
communications.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
not
with
respect
to
communication
under
the
turner
opinion,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
no,
your
honor,
we're
not
saying
that.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
no.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
correct.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
under
turner,
i
believe
turner
can
be
read
that
way.
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
only
thing
that
the
prison
was
punishing
was
the
insolent
language
contained
in
the
communication,
and
the
prison
in
this
case
did
permit
that
communication
to
occur
between
inmate
murphy,
who
is
a
law
clerk,
and
inmate
tracy.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
with
respect
to
an
inmate
law
clerk
program,
as
occurred
here--
mr.
david
l.
ohler
--we
permitted,
the
prison
permitted
communications
between--
mr.
david
l.
ohler
--i'm
sorry,
i
may
have...
i
misspoke
or
misunderstood.
i
was
simply
saying
that
turner
seemed
to
imply
that
with
respect
to
inmate-to-inmate
correspondence,
that
communications
could
be
prohibited
by
a
prison
and,
in
turner,
in
fact,
the
regulation
at
issue,
which
was
at
the
lorenz
correctional
facility
in
missouri,
as
practiced
at
that
particular
prison,
precluded
legal
communications,
and--
mr.
david
l.
ohler
--that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
correct.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
if
we're
going
to
term
the
communication
that
occurred
here
as
representation--
mr.
david
l.
ohler
--that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
your
honor,
with
respect
to--
mr.
david
l.
ohler
--i
don't
think
we
have
to
get
into
that.
i
think
the
naacp
cases
and
the
in
re
primus
line
of
cases
dealt
with
access
to
courts.
in
fact,
i
think
this
court
used
that
language
in
the
primus
case,
dealt
with
access
to
courts
by
free
citizens,
and
providing
free
citizens
with
the
tools
to
gain
a
foothold
into
the
court
and
to
advance
their
civil
rights,
and
there
is
a
large
amount
of
jurisprudence
from
this
court
relative
to
the
right
of
access
as
it
applies
to
inmates,
and
we
believe
that
that
jurisprudence
controls,
relative
to
the
right
of
access
by
inmates
in
a
prison
setting.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
that
would
be
another
matter
and,
in
fact,
that
correspondence
could
have
occurred,
and
the
difference
between
that
situation
and
the
situation
that's
presented
in
this
case
is
the
correspondence
that
is
going
outside
the
prison,
and
so
it's...
the
confrontational
aspect
of
inmate
murphy's
letter
is
not
the
same,
because
it's
being
sent
outside
the
prison.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
that
would
have
been
fine.
once
again,
we
don't
have
that
confrontational
aspect
that
occurred
when
this
correspondence
remained
within
the
prison.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
no.
our
policy
permits
outgoing
correspondence
to
go
out,
and
is
only--
mr.
david
l.
ohler
--it's
only
read
if
there's
a
reasonable
probability
to
believe
that
it
contains
certain
types
of
information
that
would
be
detrimental
to
the
prison,
so
in
most
cases
outgoing
correspondence
is
not
read.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
well--
mr.
david
l.
ohler
--the
language
contained
in
the
letter
was
disparaging
about
correctional
officer
galle.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
and
it
was
a
challenge
to
the
authority
of
correctional
officer
galle
in
particular,
but
correctional
staff
in
general,
and
it's
that--
mr.
david
l.
ohler
--correct,
and
there
were
also
other
comments
in
there
concerning
his
sexual
orientation
which
this
court
i
believe
in
thornburgh
recognized
as
a
security
concern
in
the
prison
context.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
no.
i
think
the
confrontational
aspect
of
that,
and
the
challenge
to
authority,
goes
between
inmate
murphy
and
officer
galle.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
the
problem
is,
we
don't
know
what
happens
to
the
letter
once
it
gets...
assuming
that
the
letter
was
transmitted
to
inmate
tracy,
that
letter
could
have
been--
mr.
david
l.
ohler
--it
does
that
also,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
yes.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
and
that's
one
aspect
of
it,
and
that
is
a
concern,
is
that
in
fact
this
particular
inmate
that
the
letter
was
sent
to
had
just
recently
assaulted
a
correctional
officer.
this
letter
would
tend
to
incite
inmate
tracy.
the
other
concern
is
what
this
court
termed
a
ripple
effect
when--
mr.
david
l.
ohler
--there
are...
there
still
are
concerns
there,
justice--
mr.
david
l.
ohler
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
that's
correct.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
thank
you.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
have
any
rebuttal,
but
i
would
be
happy
to
answer
any
questions.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
i
believe
that
he
could
have
sought
expungement
of
the
disciplinary
infraction.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
he
could
have
gone
to
the
state
court,
yes.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
it
seems
to
me
that
he
could
have
raised
that
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
ohler
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
untimely,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
have
a
firm
answer
with
respect
to
the
law.
