chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
99-1613,
robert
shaw
v.
kevin
murphy.
mr.
ohler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
ohler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
millett,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
am
i
wrong,
or
was
the
petitioner
wrong
in
suggesting
that
that
had
not
been
raised?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
there
are
two
levels
of
application
of
turner,
that
even
if
a
regulation
on
its
face,
so
to
speak,
is
valid
under
turner,
it
could
be
invalid
as
applied?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we've
never
held
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
millett.
mr.
renz,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
question
presented.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
do
you
have
an
answer?
are
you
saying
that
you
agree
that
the
question
presented,
does
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
grant
a
state
prison
inmate
an
independent
right
to
assist
another
state
prison
inmate,
do
you
agree
that
that
is
not
a
correct
statement
of
the
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
what
sort
of
relief
are
you
seeking?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
renz,
you
say
he
wants
to
continue
to
say
these
words,
but
i
take
it
you
don't
mean
exactly
these
words.
i
mean,
he's
not
going
to
report
exactly
the
same
incidents
if
he
wants
to
write
to
another
inmate.
you
mean,
a
letter
like
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let's
rephrase
that,
because
i
read
the
question
to
you
before
and
i
thought
i
got
a
different
answer.
let's
make
absolutely
sure
where
you
stand
on
this
thing.
the
question
presented
is,
does
the
first
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
grant
a
state
prison
inmate
an
independent
and
freestanding
right
to
assist
another
state
prison
inmate
with
a
pending
court
case
even
if
the
state
supplies
other
forms
of
legal
assistance
to
the
prison
inmate?
now,
is
that
a
correct
statement
of
the
law
or
an
incorrect
statement
of
the
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he's
inside
the
prison.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
at
a
loss
to--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
several
years
ago
we
held
in
a
habeas
corpus
case
where
the
person
sought
declaratory
relief,
also
from
the
ninth
circuit,
incidentally,
that
when
there's
a
specific
remedy
provided
you
can't
impose
a
declaratory
judgment
on
top
of
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
renz.
mr.
ohler,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ohler.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-1613,
shaw
against
murphy
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
