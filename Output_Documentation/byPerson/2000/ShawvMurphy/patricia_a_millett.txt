ms.
patricia

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals'
categorical
protection
of
inmate
legal
advice
from
rules
that
reasonably
regulate
all
other
prison
correspondence
is
inconsistent
both
with
this
court's
precedents
and
with
realities
of
prison
management.
in
our
view
prisoners...
and
in
this
court's
view,
prisoners
have
a
right
of
access
to
the
courts
to
press
their
own
grievances
and
claims,
but
this
court
has
never
recognized
a
freestanding
first
amendment
right
on
the
part
of
other
inmates
to
get
involved
in
each
others'
litigation
efforts.
that
is
particularly
true
when
the
litigating
inmate
is
already
represented
by
an
attorney.
in
lewis
v.
casey,
this
court
held
that
while
inmates
must
be
allowed
to
bring
suits
challenging
their
own
convictions
and
conditions
of
confinement,
impairment
of
any
other
litigating
capacity,
and
that
would
include
serving
as
a
legal
advisor,
is
simply
going
to
be
incidental
and
perfectly
constitutional
consequences
of
conviction
and
incarceration.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
the
remand
would
be
on
an
as-applied
challenge
to
this
particular
communication.
it
would
not
be
a
request,
as
the
ninth
circuit
found
here,
for
categorical
protection
of
all
inmate
communications
of
legal
advice.
the
question
would
be
whether
application
of
the
insolence
regulation
to
this
particular
communication,
looking
at
its
particular
content,
would
be
consistent
with
the
first
amendment
under
a--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
our
understanding
is
that
what
was
not
raised
is
whether
or
not
this
communication
fell
within
the
definition
of
insolence
or
violation
of
a
due
process,
or
interference
with
a
due
process
hearing
under
the
terms
of
the
regulations,
and
that's
not
what
we're
saying
should
be
remanded.
what
we're
saying
should
be
remanded
is
whether
there's
an
as-applied
constitutional
challenge
to
application
of
those
regulations
to
this
communication.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no,
you
could
have...
prisons
could
have
a
regulation.
for
example,
they
could
decide
that
insolence
could
includes
any,
for
example,
criticism
of
a
guard,
so
that...
and
those
might
well
pass
facial
constitutionality
under
a
turner
v.
safley
analysis,
but
you
could
still
find
that
a
comment
to
a
guard
that,
you
know,
that's
a
bad
hair
cut,
would
fall
within
the
meaning
of
insolence,
and
so
would
fall
within
the
regulation,
but
would
not
survive
a
turner
v.
safley
as-applied
analysis
because
it
would
not
be
a
security--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--absolutely,
and
i
think
that's
what...
for
example,
in
thornburgh
v.
abbott
this
court
upheld
regulations
as
applied
to
the
public
generally...
i'm
sorry,
not
as
applied,
facially,
the
application
of
a
prison
regulation
limiting
the
types
of
publications
and
magazines
that
could
come
into
a
prison,
but
remanded
for
as-applied
review
of
whether
publication
by
publication
the
prison's
decision
to
keep
a
particular
publication
out
violated
the
first
amendment,
and
that's
all
that
we
think
the
remand
here
would
need
to
encompass.
but
the
important
thing
to
keep
in
mind,
and
the
main
problem
with
the
ninth
circuit--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that's
our
understanding
of
the
complaint,
and
it's
based
in
part
on
the
magistrate
judge's
analysis
which
is
in
the
petition
appendix,
where
they
talk
about
the
failure
of
the
state
to
come
forward
at
that
stage
with
information
showing
why
this
particular
communication
was
a
threat
to
security.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
we
understood
that
argument
in
the
complaint,
that
analysis
by
the
magistrate
judge
and
respondent's,
including
respondent's
arguments
here
about
whether,
you
know,
how
this
particular
communication
does
or
does
not
challenge
security
interests
as
an
as-applied
challenge,
but
we're
not
here
because
we
have
a
strong
interest
on
that.
if
we've
misunderstood
the
record,
and
there
is
no
as-applied
challenge
in
the
case,
then
there
would
be
no
basis
for
a
remand.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes.
well,
our
position
is
that
there's
no
special
first
amendment
status
accorded
to
this
communication
because
it
was
legal
advice.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
exactly.
that...
the
crux
of
our
point
is
that
turner
v.
safley
is
a
sufficient
test
to
review
all
prison
regulations,
and--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
our
position
is
that
inmates
could
always
claim
that
and
then
the
burden
would
be
on
the
prison
to
show
in
the
circumstances
that
there
is
or
is
not.
for
most
of
the
time
there's
a
lot
of
prisoner
communication
that
goes
on
that
does
not
affect
prison
security.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
the...
i
think
the
premise
of
the
recognition
that
you
read
would
be
reviewed
under
turner
v.
safley,
and
i
think
a
regulation
that
said,
prisoners
shall
never,
under
all
circumstances
shall
never
speak
to
another
inmate,
no
inmate
shall
ever
speak
to
another
inmate,
would
have
to
be
reviewed
under
turner
v.
safley,
and
the
government
would
have
to
come
in
and
show
why
any
communication
at
all
between
inmates
is
a
threat
to
security.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i'm
sorry
if
i
misunderstood
your
question.
our
only
position
is
that
there
certainly
may
be
circumstances,
in
fact,
in
which
it
would
be
appropriate
for
a
prison
to
say,
there
shall
be
no
communications
at
all
between
inmates,
either
curfew
times,
or
lockdown
situations,
or
high
security--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--he
was.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
our
understanding
is
that
he
was
allowed
to
write
a
letter
to
this
inmate,
so
there
was
not
a
complete
ban
on
communication
between
people,
inmates
in
respondent's
category
and
this
high
risk,
or
this
maximum
security
unit.
there
was
not
a
complete
ban
on
communications.
it
was
just
the
content
of
this
letter.
clearly,
any
communication
that
is
written
between
prisoners
must
be
consistent
with
valid
penalogical
limitations
on
those,
and
those
would
include
that
communications
not
be
insolent
or
incite
one
inmate
against
another,
inmate
against
another
or
against
guards
or
prison
staff.
the
important
thing,
we
think,
to
keep
in
mind
with
respect
to
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
is
that
the
turner
v.
safley
test
is
sufficient
for
purposes
of
analyzing
any
first
amendment
claims
to
speech
or
other
rights
invoked
by
prisoners
and
that
beyond
that,
prison
correspondence
involving
legal
advice
does
not
have
any
special
exemption
from
those
rules,
should
not
be
analyzed
under
any
separate
standard
and,
in
fact,
can
present
the
exact
same
dangers
that
routine
correspondence
does.
they
can...
according
special
status,
as
the
ninth
circuit
has
done,
to
inmate
correspondence
could
allow
that
type
of
correspondence
to
become
a
ready
vehicle
for
secretly
coded
communications
and
other
illicit
communications.
jailhouse
lawyers
are
frequently
a
menace
to
prison
discipline,
and
they
could
be
allowed
through
special
treatment
to
set
up
an
order
or
a
hierarchy
that
would
compete
with
the
prison
order
system.
in
addition,
the
circulation
among
inmates
of
potentially
volatile
allegations
and
accusations
can,
in
the
judgment
of
prison
officials,
exacerbate
the
already
extremely
tense
relations
between
prison
officials
and
inmates
and
that,
much
like
in
jones
v.
north
carolina
prisoners
labor
union,
where
this
court
held
that
prisoner
communications,
prisoner
assertions
of
first
amendment
speech
and
association
rights
that
are
focused
on
encouraging
an
increase
in
adversarial
relations
between
prison
and
staff
can
be
regulated
and
restricted
consistent
with
legitimate
penalogical
objectives.
and
finally,
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
there
are
ample
alternative
channels
for
inmates
to
communicate
information
bearing
on
a
case.
they
can
communicate
with
attorneys,
government
officials,
courts
and
other
members
of
the
public.
they
may
bring
their
own
grievances
or
lawsuits.
the
appropriate
analysis,
we
think,
is
turner
v.
safley
and,
beyond
that,
the...
to
the
extent
someone
is
concerned
about
information
getting
into
courts.
thank
you.
