is
another
way
of
saying
what
you're
trying...
maybe
i
don't
quite
get
it,
that
even
though
he
doesn't
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
act
as
a
lawyer
and
practice
law
in
the
prison
context,
he
had
a
first
amendment
right
to
write
this
particular
letter?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
but
just
under
ordinary
first
amendment
review--
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
another
point,
too,
that
if
the
prison
regulations
do
permit
communication,
there
is
still...
there
arguably
could
be
a
first
amendment
right
to
say
certain
things
in
those
communications
without...
in
other
words,
they
say,
we'll
let
you
write
letters,
but
we're
going
to
tell
you
exactly
what
you
can
say.
that's
a
rather
strange
view.
well,
anyway--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
renz,
i
don't
want
to
invade
your
attorney-client
privilege
or
anything
like
that,
so
don't
answer
the
question
if
you
think
it's
improper,
but
i'm
just
very
puzzled,
how
is
it
that
you're
not
challenging
the
discipline
to
your
client,
when
you're
challenging
the
basis
for
the
discipline?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
sanction
must
have
adverse
consequences
for
his
future
status
in
prison,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
if
you're
not
asking
to
have
it
expunged.
it
would
still
be
on
his
record.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
very
puzzled.
i
just
don't
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
he
were
now
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
ask
to
amend
the
complaint
and
say,
under
my
prayer
for
any
other
relief,
or
whatever
the
language
is,
i
would
like
to
have
this
order
expunged
from
my
record?
would
that
be
untimely?
