justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
while
kevin
murphy
was
incarcerated
in
state
prison,
he
learned
that
a
fellow
inmate
had
been
charged
with
assaulting
a
correctional
officer.
murphy
decided
to
assist
the
inmate
with
his
defense
and
sent
him
a
letter
to
this
effect.
the
prison
intercepted
this
letter
in
accordance
with
prison
policy.
based
on
the
letter’s
content,
the
prison
sanctioned
murphy
for
violating
prison
rules
prohibiting
insolence
and
interfering
with
due
process
hearings.
murphy
sought
relief
under
section
1983
alleging
violation
of
the
first
amendment
including
the
right
to
provide
legal
assistance
to
other
inmates.
the
district
court
rejected
this
claim
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
according
to
the
court
of
appeals
prisoner’s
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
give
legal
assistance
to
other
inmates,
the
effect
of
this
holding
is
that
prisoner
correspondence
containing
legal
advice
is
entitle
to
more
constitutional
protection
then
prisoner
correspondence
not
containing
such
advice.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
reverse
and
remand.
in
turner
v.
safley
this
court
set
a
unitary
standard
for
reviewing
prisoners’
constitutional
claims.
under
this
test
a
prison
regulation
impinging
on
inmates’
constitutional
rights
is
valid
if
it
is
reasonably
related
to
legitimate
penological
interests.
turner
does
not
permit
an
increase
in
constitutional
protection
when
a
prisoner’s
communication
includes
legal
advice.
the
value
of
a
communication
is
not
relevant
to
turner
analysis
which
concerns
only
the
relationship
between
the
assorted
penological
interest
and
the
prison
regulation.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
