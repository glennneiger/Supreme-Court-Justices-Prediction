justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'm
slightly
mixed
up,
because
i
thought,
suppose
that
inmate
a
wants
to
represent
inmate
b,
but
he
isn't.
i
thought
you
were
saying
that's
this
case,
and
there's
no
special
right
to
be
a
lawyer.
you
don't
have
a
constitutional
right
to
get
to
be
a
lawyer,
any
more
than
you
get
to
be
an
architect,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there's
a
different
situation.
a
is
representing
b.
in
that
case,
b,
not
a,
has
a
right
to
legal
representation,
which
may
involve
sending
letters.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
that,
i
thought.
am
i
not
right
that
a
is
not
representing
b
in
this
case,
he'd
just
like
to?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
if
we're
writing
an
opinion,
i
guess,
shouldn't
i
be
careful,
drawing
on
your
personal
view,
not
some
case
but
your
view
as
a
lawyer,
to
make
certain
that
we
don't
say,
we
don't
talk
about
the
situation
where
b,
who
is
the
person
who
needs
a
lawyer,
he
may
well
have
a
right
to
get
communications
from
his
lawyer
that
is
different
from
the
ordinary
right
just
to
speak.
am
i
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
what
about
the
case
where
we
have
an
association
of
people
who
help
to
provide
lawyers
to
inmates?
i'm
obviously
thinking
of
naacp
v.
button,
for
example,
and
maybe
that
association
of
lawyers,
or
people
who
want
to
give
lawyers
to
inmates,
has
a
few
inmates
in
it.
might
they
have
a
special
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
want
to
say
we
don't
have
to
get
into
that
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
did
have
a
whole
paragraph
where...
i
thought
a
whole
paragraph
where
the
ninth
circuit
says
there's
a
special
right
that
every
prisoner
has
to
represent
other
prisoners.
i
mean,
it's
on...
it's
appendix
page
9
here.
it
says,
the
prison
discipline
of
murphy
implicates
the
first
amendment
right
recognized
by
this
court
in
rizzo,
where
we
held
the
provision
of
legal
assistance
to
fellow
inmates
is
an
activity
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
and
then
they
said,
several
of
our
sister
circuits
have
refused
to
recognize
a
constitutional
right
to
assist
others.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
a
right
to
get
assistance.
it's
a
right
to
assist
others.
everybody
has
a
constitutional
right
to
be
a
lawyer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
how
i
read
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
know
you
had
that
right,
and
i
haven't
seen
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
think
there
is
a
separate,
freestanding
right
to
assist
others
in
pressing
legal
claims?
that's
where
a
wants
to
represent
b.
i'm
not
talking
about
b's
right
to
get
assistance.
i'm
talking
about
a's
right
to
go
to
somebody
and
say,
i
want
to
represent
you.
do
you
think
there's
a
special,
freestanding,
first
amendment
right
to
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i
mean...
all
right.
i
didn't
read
turner
recently,
so
don't
say
not
outside
of
turner.
just
say
yes
or
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there?
i
didn't
know
there
was.
i
mean,
everyone
has
a
right
to
go
assist
other
people
as
a
lawyer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
have...
what
is
there,
a
special
first
amendment
right
to
be
a
lawyer?
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
saying
there
isn't
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
just
saying
i'm
not
familiar
with
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean,
there's
a
special
first
amendment
right
to
do
that?
i
mean,
maybe
there
is.
i
just
haven't
seen
it.
i
don't
know.
i'm
not
familiar
with
it.
what
case...
is
there
a
case
that
says
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
there
you
have
a
special
right
to
give
somebody
legal
assistance
that's
different
from
your
ordinary
first
amendment
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
you
object
to
an
opinion
from
us
that
says
the
following?
there
are
passages
in
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
that
suggests
there
exists
a
special,
separate,
freestanding
right
of
a
prisoner
to
represent
someone
else,
even
if
he
doesn't
want
it,
or
whatever.
we
are
not
aware
of
any
such
right.
of
course,
the
first
amendment
applies
to
prisons
as
anywhere
else,
and
so
we've
written
about
that,
so
go
back
and
consider
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
you'd
like?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
adding,
and
we're
not
certain
how
you
happen
to
be
in
court,
because
there
might
be
a
problem
here
of
declaratory
relief.
what
you
asked
for
in
your
complaint
was
a
declaration
that
rule
009
and
022
are
too
vague,
and
that
this
violated...
and
that
you
can't
have
a
policy
in
a
prison
which
says
content
of
a
letter
is
relevant
to
discipline.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
