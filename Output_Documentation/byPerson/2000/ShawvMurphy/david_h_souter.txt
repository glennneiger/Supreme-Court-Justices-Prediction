justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if...
are
you
answering
your
question
limited
simply
to
sending
letters,
or
are
you
saying
that
one
inmate
can
be
assigned
to
defend
another,
and
the
prison
may
preclude
all
communication
between
them
of
any
sort
whatsoever?
are
you
saying
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
limiting
it
simply
to
written...
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy
is
limited
simply
to
written
statements?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
the
confrontation
that
you're
talking
about?
i
may
not
understand
what
you
mean.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
spoke
about
confrontational
aspect.
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
was
a
challenge
to
his
exercise,
or
as
the
letter
claimed,
his
abuse
of
authority.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
what's
the
confrontation?
are
you
talking
about
the
confrontation
between
the
person
who
writes
the
letter
and
the
prison
censor
who
reads
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
officer
galle
never
saw
the
letter,
could
not
have
been,
i
take
it,
expected
to
see
the
letter.
the
only
person
who
could
be
expected
to
see
the
letter,
other
than
the
recipient,
was
the
prison
censor.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
you're
talking
about
the
confrontational
aspect
of
the
letter.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
is...
i'm
sorry.
i
was
going
to
say,
as
a
general
proposition,
you've
already
got
that
in
turner
and
safley,
and
you
either
want
something
specific
to
this
case,
though
without
any
relief
in
this
particular
case,
or
you
want
something
broader,
and
when
you
state
what
the
broader
relief
is
that
you
might
want,
it
seems
to
be
about
the
same
level
of
generality
as
turner
and
safley
itself,
so
we're
stuck
as
to
what
we
can
do
for
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--even
if
we
accept
your
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
you
defending
the
ninth
circuit,
or
are
you
not?
do
you
adopt
their
reasoning,
and
are
you
prepared
to
defend
it?
