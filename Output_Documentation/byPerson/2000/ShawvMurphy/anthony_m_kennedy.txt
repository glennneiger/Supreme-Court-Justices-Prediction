justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
you
have
a
prison
where,
in
a
disciplinary
proceeding,
not
a
criminal
charge
but
a
disciplinary
proceeding,
one
inmate,
as
the
custom,
often
represents
another.
do
you
think
then
the
so-called
inmate
law
clerk
would
have
a
privilege
to
communicate
with
the
inmate
that
he's
representing?
it's
maybe
a
little
hard
for
you
to
answer,
because
we
have
to
assume
a
lot
of
regulations
and
stuff
that
are
not
in
play,
but
just
to
flat
out
say
that
there's
never
this
right
is
somewhat...
goes
somewhat
far,
i
think.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
my
question
is,
does
he
have
a
right
to
send
the
communication?
you
say
there's
no
right
at
all,
we
don't
have
to
get
into
insolence
or
interpretation
of
the
letter,
there's
just
simply
no
right,
but
i'm
suggesting
that
in
some
instances
there
might
be.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
when
one
inmate's
representing
another
in,
say,
a
grievance
proceeding,
or,
pardon
me,
a
disciplinary
proceeding?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
both
of
justice
ginsburg's
hypotheticals,
i
assume
the
prison
authorities
would
read
the
letter
first,
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
it's
a
hypothetical,
but
i
assume...
that's
your
regulation.
don't
you
read
everything
that
goes
out?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
whether
or
not
it's
read.
it's
not
read?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
in
your
view
there
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
your
view
there's
a
first
amendment
right
for
prisoners
to
communicate
with
each
other?
i
mean,
does...
that
has
to
be
the
beginning
point,
based
on
my
understanding
of
your
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
a
very
substantial
holding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
asking
us
to
have
a
foundational
proposition
that
there's
a
first
amendment
right
for
prisoners
to
communicate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
the
only--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
question
that
was
presented.
justice
o'connor
put
the
question
to
you.
that's
the
question
in
the
blue
brief.
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
mean,
this
is
the
question
that
we're
interested
in.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
you
say
that
you're
in
agreement
that
there's
no
special
right
to
render
legal
advice,
then
all
this
is
is
a
question
whether
or
not
this
communication,
or
other
communications
like
them,
can,
for
general
purposes
be
suppressed,
and
the
fact
that
he
wants
to
give
legal
advice,
he
doesn't
have
a
right
to
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
don't
know
what...
this
is
just
a
routine
prison
disciplinary
case
once
you
concede
the
main
proposition
on
which
we
granted
the
case.
