mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
appears
to
me
that
the
state
prison
here
is
proposing
a
change
in
the
turner
rule
which
the
turner
opinion
does
not
accommodate.
as
i
understand
the
state's
position,
so
long
as
their
rules
are
neutrally
drawn,
and
so
long
as
the
rules
on
their
face
satisfy
turner,
then
they
are
free
to
apply
them
in
any
manner
in
which
they
deem
fit.
i
don't
think
that
turner
says
that.
i
don't
think
that
turner
nor
abbott
contemplate
that.
this
is
an
as-applied
case,
it
was
an
as-applied
case,
and
it
always
has
been
an
as-applied
case,
with
the
single
exception
that
mr.
murphy
challenged
the
rules
on
their
face
as
vague,
and
the
vagueness
issue,
the
facial
vagueness
issue
is
not
before
this
court.
this
case
is
strictly
about
punishment
of
content
of
speech.
i
think
there
are
several
issues
here
that
are
not
in
dispute.
first,
this
is
speech
that,
if
uttered
outside
the
prison,
is
without
question
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
second,
this
communication
was
permitted
within
the
prison.
that
is,
mr.
murphy
was
permitted
under
the
prison's
regulations
to
write
to
mr.
tracy.
and
third,
if
these
two
things
are
true,
as
they
are,
then
turner
and
abbott
provide
the
analytical
framework
for
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
i
think
that
the
language
in
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
--well,
i
would
contend,
your
honor,
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
being
somewhat
circular
when
they
said
that
the
prison's
emphasis
is
at
a
low
edge,
ebb
when
the
language
is
legal
advice.
no,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
no.
no,
we
do
not
contend
that.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
that's
not
the
end
of
the
case,
your
honor.
i'm
the
respondent,
and
this
court
may
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
on
any
grounds
that
appear
in
the
record.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
yes,
but
this
in
my
view
is
a
straightforward
turner
application.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
i
would
agree
with
that,
yes,
but
what
we
have
here
is,
we
have
a
communication
permitted
by
the
prison
that
contained
information
and
contained
legal
advice,
and
mr.
murphy
was
punished
for
what
he
said.
he
was
punished
for
what
he
said
and
the
prison
has
never,
ever
stated
why
that
punishment
advanced
the
interests
it
articulates.
it
has
never
shown
the
connection
between
its
articulated
interests
and
the
punishment
of
mr.
murphy,
and
that
is
exactly
what
turner
and
abbott
require.
that
has
never
happened
here.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
--if
the
question
is
whether
we
are
seeking
relief
to
purge
the
discipline,
that's
right.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
we're
seeking
declaratory
relief,
your
honor,
that
says
the
prison
may
not
do
this
without
demonstrating
some
sort
of
connection
between
its
interests
and
what
it
has
done.
remember,
it
has
punished
mr.
murphy.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
well,
mr.
murphy
continues
to
be
imprisoned.
he
continues
to
give
legal
advice
for
the
prisoners.
he's
seeking,
and
sought
in
this
lawsuit
prospective
relief.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
i
think
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
murphy
wants
to
continue
giving
legal
advice
without
the
fear
of
sanctions,
and
a
declaration
that
the
prison
may
not
do
this
without
demonstrating
some
connection
between
its
punishment
and
the
interests
it
articulates--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
--i
see.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
the...
let
me
catch
up.
the...
mr.
murphy
wrote
this
letter.
he
said
these
words.
he
wants
to
continue
to
be
able
to
say
these
words
without
fear
of
sanction.
saying
to
the
prison
that
you
may
not
punish
these
words
without
showing
us
more
means
that
he
is
armed
with
something
in
the
future
when
the
prison
comes
to
him
and
says--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
--a
letter
like
this.
remember,
the
prison
has
acted
to
apply
its
rules
in
a
certain
way.
it's
extended
the
scope
of
its
rule
to
encompass
this
kind
of
speech.
now,
the
prison
is
free
to
do
that
so
long
as
they
show
a
connection
between
its
interests
and
the
extension
of
the
rule
and
the
punishment
of
mr.
murphy,
but
they
haven't
done
that
here.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
i
think
that's--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
--well,
he
certainly
has
no
special
right.
i
mean,
he
was
hired
and
retained
as
a
legal
clerk.
he
was
under
the
practices
of
the
prison
permitted
to
communicate
and
assist
mr.
murphy,
even
though
mr.
murphy
may
have
had
counsel.
but
the
question
here
is
whether
he
can
be
punished
by
the
prison
for
his
communication,
and
the
prison
has
taken
a
rule,
expanded
its
scope
to
encompass
mr.
murphy's
speech,
and
they've
not
articulated
a
basis
for
it.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
well,
i
disagree
with
your
statement,
justice
scalia.
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
provide
advice
to
another
prisoner.
the
question
is
whether
it
survives
a
turner
analysis.
in
this
case,
it
survives
the
turner
analysis.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
as
i
understood
justice
o'connor's
question,
it
was
whether
or
not
there
was
a
special,
sort
of
elevated
right,
and
i
would
have
to
agree--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
--then--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
--then,
justice
o'connor,
i
apologize,
because
i
misunderstood
your
question.
if--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
--i'm
prepared
to
defend
it.
if
we--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
--i...
as
i
construe
it,
i
think
it's
a
fair
statement,
and
that
is
that
were
mr.
murphy
outside
the
prison,
he
would
have
an
independent
and
freestanding
right--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
--that's
correct,
and
once
he
is
inside
the
prison
we
then
engage
in
the
turner
analysis.
i'm
not
sure
if--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
--i'm
at
a
loss,
too.
if
we
take...
what
i'm
saying
is
that
we
don't
have
an
independent
freestanding
right
that
survives,
or
stands
outside
of
turner.
i
think
that
is
a
correct
statement.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
to
the
extent
that
they
create
a
right
outside
of
turner--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
--but
they
didn't
do
that.
they
engaged
in
a
straightforward
turner
analysis.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
justice
breyer,
that's
right.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
that's
right.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
but
the
holding
in
rizzo
was,
rizzo
was
a
retaliation
case
decided
at
the
pleadings
stage,
and
in
that
case
the
prisoner
was
free
to
assist
other
prisoners
in
his
particular
prison.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
to
provide
assistance?
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
not
outside
of
turner.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
well,
yes,
there
is
in
the
sense
that
we
have
the
same
kind
of
right
outside
of
prison.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
not
as
a
lawyer,
your
honor,
but
of
course--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
--well,
if--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
--oh,
no,
i
understand.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
if
the
brotherhood
of
trainmen
can
send
a
union
secretary
to
another
trainman
and
say,
don't
settle
this
case,
go
see
this
lawyer,
and
that
is
protected
under
the
first
amendment--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
--it's
the
brotherhood
of
trainmen,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
no,
not
different
from
the
ordinary
first
amendment.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
i...
in
terms
of
the
right
of
association?
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
i
don't
think
necessarily
because
of
primus
and--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
--i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
the...
it
depends
upon
what
we
call
legal
advice.
someone
on
the
street
can
say,
gee,
you
know,
this
car
ran
over
you,
your
case
is
worth
a
lot
of
money,
you
should
go
see
a
lawyer.
that's
legal
advice,
but
it
certainly
isn't
the
sort
of
legal
advice
that
we'd
consider
in
terms
of
what
lawyers
give.
this
is
much
the
same
character
of
the
advice
that
murphy
gave.
gee,
i
know
about
these
things
about
mr.
galle.
you
should
have
your
lawyer
get
a
hold
of
me
on
this.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
and
part
of
that
communication
from
mr.
murphy
said
that
exactly,
justice
ginsburg.
he
said,
this
happened
to
me,
and
that
makes
him
a
competent
witness.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
i
suspect
that
it
may
have
come
from
our
argument
in
which
we
articulated
that
the
prison
has
no
legitimate
interest
in
regulating
a
communication
that
is
intended
for
a
court
outside
the
prison.
i
can't
say.
i
don't
see
that
specifically
in
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement
of
the
law,
justice
breyer.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
well,
now
we're
talking
about
fashioning
relief--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
--and
i
think
that's
for
the
lower
court.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
[laughter]
i
would
not
be
objecting
to
being
thrown
into
the
briar
patch.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
crafting
of
relief
is
something
that
needs
to
be
done.
we
haven't
done
that
yet.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
i
think
so.
i
mean,
we're
sort
of
jumping
down
the
road
here
when
we
talk
about
the
form
of
relief.
i
mean,
the
form
of
relief
hasn't
been
crafted
yet,
and
i
think
that
we
can
do
that.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
well,
as
we
read
edwards...
well,
edwards
hadn't
been
decided
yet.
as
we
read
heck
and
played
heck
out
it
was
argued
that
we
were
not
in
a
position
to
purge
the
sanction
against
him.
to
the
extent
that--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
--that
would
be
true,
but
an
opinion
from
the
district
court
order
of
the
ninth
circuit
that
said
he
was...
what
he
had
done
was
protected
by
the
constitution
would
certainly
vitiate
that.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
it
would
be
on
his
record,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
--the
holding
of
the
court
that
what
he
had
done
was
protected
by
the
constitution
and
was
legal
and
permitted
would
also
be
before
the
parole
board
or
whoever
might
see
that
information.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
well,
we
also--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
--we
do
seek
conjunctive
relief
in
this
case,
judge...
justice--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
renz
uh-huh,
but
this
court
also
held
in
edwards
v.
ballistock,
and
that
was
a
prison
discipline
case,
that
the
correction
of
that
prison
discipline
was
not
something
that
was
cognizable
under
section
1983.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
submit
the
case.
