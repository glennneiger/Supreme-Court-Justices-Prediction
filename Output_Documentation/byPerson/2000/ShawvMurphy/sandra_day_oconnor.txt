justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there's
some
discussion
in
the
briefs
about
the
penalties
that
were
imposed
on
the
prisoner
by
virtue
of
his
writing
the
letter
that
he
wrote.
i
guess
those
are
not
at
issue
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
take
the
position,
then,
that
if
an
inmate
were,
by
the
prison,
assigned
to
provide
legal
assistance
to
another
prisoner,
that
no
written
communication
could
be
sent
from
the
one
providing
the
assistance
to
the
other
prisoner?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
possible
interest
would
the
prison
have
in
prohibiting...
assuming
you
allowed
an
inmate
to
provide
legal
services
to
another,
which
sometimes
i
understand
happens,
what
interest
of
the
prison
is
there
in
making
sure
that
it
is
never
done
in
written
form,
which
the
prison
can
then
read?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
just
told
me
that
you
would
not
allow
any
written
communication,
even
though
a
law
clerk
assignment
had
been
made.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
i
thought
this
involved
such
a
situation.
the
person
to
whom
respondent
wanted
to
communicate
was
in
a
maximum
security
section.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
had
understood
the
prison
did
not
permit
communication
from
prisoners
in
other
parts
of
the
prison
with
lesser
restrictions
to
prisoners
in
the
maximum
security.
am
i
wrong?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
the
ninth
circuit
articulated
at
least
some
freestanding
first
amendment
right
of
a
fellow
prisoner
to
offer
legal
advice
to
another
prisoner.
at
least
there's
language
to
that
effect
in
its
opinion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
defend
that
as
a
proposition
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
do
you
contend...
excuse
me.
do
you
contend
that
the
prisoner
has
a
freestanding
first
amendment
right
to
offer
legal
advice
to
another
prisoner?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
freestanding
first
amendment
right
to
represent
another
prisoner,
and
i
thought
you
told
me
no,
there
is
not,
that
you
did
not
defend--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--what
it
was
the
ninth
circuit
panel
said.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
think
that
stemmed
from
some
labor
union
contract
dealing
with
discipline
of
employees
and
union
members?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
the
private
world,
outside
the
labor
contract,
no
labor
union
agreement,
and
you
just
have
a
nonlawyer
who
wants
to
give
legal
advice
to
somebody
else.
is
there
some
freestanding
first
amendment
right
to
give
legal
advice?
you
don't
have
to
be
a
lawyer.
you
have
some
right
to
go
give
legal
advice
to
somebody?
