justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
ohler,
may
i
ask
if...
at
least
i
understood
that
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
not
the
same
as
the
one
that
you
are
telling
us
about,
nothing
else
being
at
issue
but
the
insolence
and
the
other
charge.
i
thought
that
the
position
of
the
united
states
was
that
this
should
be
remanded
for
consideration
of
those
factors
of
that
part
of
the
case
in
light
of
turner
v.
safley.
is
that
wrong?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
it
have
been
the
same
offense,
in
your
view,
if
the...
was
it
murphy,
had
sent
the
letter
not
to
tracy
but
to
tracy's
assigned
counsel?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
it
were
sent
to
an
investigative
reporter?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
more
so
than
if
his
lawyer
had
told
him,
his
lawyer
said,
i
got
this
letter
from
a
fellow
inmate,
what
do
you
think
of
it,
or
if
an
investigative
reporter
asked
him?
would
it
be
less...
would
that
be
less
of
a
problem?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
have
no
control
over
the
lawyers,
i
take
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
millett,
will
you
clarify
for
us
what
the
united
states
would
remand?
what
would
be
open
to
the
court
below
to
consider,
assuming
we
accept
your
first
position
that
there
is
no
right
of,
to
represent...
one
inmate
to
another
to
represent
each
other?
there's
no
attorney-client
relationship
that
stems
from
any
constitutional
guarantee.
let's
say
we
accept
that.
what
would
you
remand
on?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
renz,
would
you
clarify...
what
we
were
told
before
was
that
you
had
waived
all
of
that,
that
you
were
not
contesting
the
disciplinary
action
that
was
taken
against
him.
i
think
that's
what
we
were
told
was
your
position.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
were
told
that
you
were
not
contesting
the
disciplinary
action
that
was
taken.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
said
you're
not
challenging
the
punishment.
that's
what's
so
odd
about
this.
the
reference...
murphy
does
not
seek
expungement
of
his
record,
the
record,
i
take
it,
being
the
record
of
his
discipline.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
you're
not
challenging
that,
then
i
don't
understand
what
interest
you
have
in
an
abstract
statement
of
what
the
law
should
be
in
another
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's...
i
think
what's
bothering
us
is,
we
understand
that
there
very
well
may
properly
be
requests
for
declaratory
relief
of
a
general
sort,
but
what
you're
seeking
here
apparently
isn't
declaratory
relief
as
a
general
sort.
it's
a
declaration
that
an
as-applied
challenge,
this
challenge,
this
communication,
this
instance
only,
is
valid
because
there's
a
first
amendment
violation,
and
yet
with
respect
to
this
specific
instance
you're
not
asking
for
any
relief.
it
doesn't
seem
to
fit
into
any
of
our
recognized
categories
of
litigable
issues.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
sounds
like
somebody
saying,
i'm
a
witness,
a
potential
witness
for
you,
but
not
that
i
have
a
right
to
give
you
legal
advice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
arguing
for
some
kind
of
a
right
for
somebody
with
relevant
information
to
convey
it
to
someone
who's
in
trouble,
but
that's
not
the
theory
that
the
ninth
amendment,
ninth
circuit
proceeded
on,
and
i'm
wondering
where
they
got
it
from.
was
it
in
your
briefs?
did
you
argue
that
theory
to
the
ninth
circuit,
that
there
is
a
right
of
one
person
to
represent
another?
