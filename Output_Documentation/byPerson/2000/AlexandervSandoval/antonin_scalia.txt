justice
antonin
scalia
atascadero,
which
you
put
so
much
reliance
on,
is
distinguishable
in
that
it
did
involve
a
money
damage
action,
and
it
explicitly
involved
the
eleventh
amendment.
that's
not
the
issue
here,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
the
agency
not
have
had
any
rulemaking
authority
without
section
602?
wouldn't
it
have
had
the
ability
to
promulgate
interpretive
regulations--
justice
antonin
scalia
--setting
forth
what
its
own
view
of
the
anti-intentional
discrimination
provision
of
601
was?
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
and
under
our
case
law
it
wouldn't
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
only
way
the
regulation
here
is
valid
is
on
the
assumption
that
it
is
not
an
interpretive
regulation,
but
rather
is
a
regulation
that
goes
beyond
the
meaning
of
601
in
a
prophylactic
way
to,
as
601
puts
it,
to
effectuate
the
provisions
of
601?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
the
question
for
which
we
took
the
case,
and
i'm
assuming
and
will
assume
that
the
regulations
are
valid.
now,
are...
is
it
your
position...
is
it
your
position
that
if
the
agency
promulgated
a
regulation
that
was
an
interpretive
regulation
which
was
not
precluded
by
our
prior
case
law,
namely,
it
didn't
say
that
you
don't
have
to
have
intentional
discrimination
but
it
said,
this
is
what
intentional
discrimination
consists
of,
and
that
regulation
is
within
the
bounds
of
reasonableness
that
would
satisfy
chevron,
is
it
your
position
that
that
regulation
also
would
not
be
able
to
be
vindicated
by
a
private
right
of
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
a
text
cannot...
you're...
a
text
cannot
unambiguously
create
a
right
for
the
agency
to
issue
a
chevron-based
rule
which
is
premised
upon
an
ambiguity
in
the
statute.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
agency
has
no
chevron
power
unless
there's
an
ambiguity
in
the
statute,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
matter
to
you
whether
it's
an
interpretive
rule
or
a
substantive
rule,
you
can't
imply
it
against
the
state
in
a
private
right
of
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
handles
the
eleventh
amendment
argument,
but
it
doesn't
handle
the
spending
clause
argument,
you
know,
the
argument
that
any
conditions
you're
imposing
upon
the
states
under
the
spending
clause
have
to
be
clear.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
but
the
university
wasn't
a
state
university,
it
was
a
private
university.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
sort
of
crucial
to
your
spending
clause
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
our
cases
say
that
even
when
you're
using
your
spending
clause
power
to
give
private
individuals
the
rights
to
some
federal
money
you
have
to
be
clear.
i
thought
we
only
have
said
that
when
you're
giving
money
to
the
states
under
the
spending
clause
you
have
to
be
clear.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
schnapper,
the
two
cases
that
you
said
did
involve
regulations,
bazemore
and
alexander,
were
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
they
involve
a
regulation
that
could
not
possibly
have
been
an
interpretive
regulation?
you
see,
i
mean
that's
what's
distinctive
about
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
what's
distinctive
about
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
here
we
have
a
regulation
that
cannot
possibly
represent
the
agency's
view
of
what
the
statute,
601,
requires,
because
we've
said
what
601
requires,
and
it
doesn't
require
this.
now,
did
those,
either
of
those
two
cases
involve
that
kind
of
a
regulation?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
would
be
'64
to
'86.
i
mean,
you're
relying
to
some
extent
on
much
later
amendments
to
the
act.
i
mean,
that's
a
substantial
part
of
your
case,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
at
least
by
the
time
those
amendments
were
adopted,
those
earlier
cases
were
subject
to
considerable
doubt.
justice
antonin
scalia
were
those
regulations
that
you're
concerned
about
regulations
that
plainly
went
beyond
an
interpretation
of
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
see,
i
mean,
that's
what's
distinct
about
this
case.
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
it
involves
a
state,
you
have
a
regulation
that
cannot
possibly
be
characterized
as
simply
an
agency
interpretation
of
the
statute.
now,
are
the
medicare
regulations
that
you're
talking
about
of
that
genre?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wish
i
were,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
respondent
martha
sandoval
sought
to
obtain
an
automobile
driver’s
license
from
petitioner
the
alabama
department
of
public
safety
what
was
hindered
in
that
attempt
by
the
department’s
policy
of
administering
the
license
examinations
only
in
english.
seeking
to
force
the
department
to
administer
the
examination
in
other
languages,
she
suited
under
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
or
more
precisely
she
suited
under
a
regulation
promulgated
by
the
united
states
department
of
justice
under
or
pursuant
to
title
vi.
the
distinction
between
title
vi
and
its
regulations
is
central
to
this
case.
title
vi
itself
in
section
601
prohibits
only
intentional
discrimination
based
on
race,
color,
or
national
origin
as
we
recognized
most
recently
in
alexander
versus
choate,
and
as
the
parties
to
this
case
all
agree.
some
regulations
promulgated
under
section
602
of
title
vi
however,
reach
more
broadly.
that
is
two
of
the
regulation
at
issue
here
called
a
disparate-impact
regulation,
which
prohibits
the
use
of
administrative
methods
that
have
the
effect
although
they
do
not
have
the
intent
of
subjecting
individuals
to
discrimination
based
on
race,
color
or
national
origin.
this
court
has
never
squarely
held
that
such
regulations,
which
make
unlawful
action
that
601
itself
permits
are
valid,
although
when
a
case
called
guardians
association
versus
civil
service
commission
of
new
york
city
five
justices
voiced
that
view
of
the
law
at
least
as
alternative
grounds
for
their
decisions.
for
purposes
of
the
present
case
however,
we
assume
that
such
regulations
are
valid.
the
issue
presented
in
the
case
is
whether
private
individuals
may
sue
directly
to
enforce
such
disparate-impact
regulations.
our
decision
in
cannon
versus
university
of
chicago
clearly
establishes
that
private
individuals
may
sue
to
enforce
section
601’s
ban
on
intentional
discrimination,
but
we
have
never
resolved
whether
they
may
also
sue
to
enforce
the
regulations
promulgated
under
section
602.
cannon
had
no
cause
to
reach
that
issue,
because
it
was
decided
on
the
assumption
that
the
respondent
there
had
intentionally
discriminated
and
so
could
rest
exclusively
on
section
601.
the
holding
of
our
later
decision
in
guardians
association.
versus
civil
service
commission
of
new
york
city
likewise
did
not
require
us
to
resolve
that
issue
and
of
the
five
justices
who
voted
in
guardians
to
approve
disparate-impact
regulations
as
lawful,
three
expressly
reserved
the
question
of
a
direct
private
right
of
action
to
enforce
them.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
resolved
this
open
question
in
favor
of
respondent,
it
held
that
a
private
right
of
action
does
exist
to
enforce
the
disparate-impact
regulations
at
issue
here.
we
reserve.
the
rule
our
cases
have
established
is
that
private
rights
of
action
to
enforce
federal
law,
like
substantive
federal
law
itself
must
be
created
by
congress.
the
judicial
task
is
to
interpret
the
statute
congress
has
passed
to
determine
whether
it
displays
and
intent
to
create
not
just
a
right
but
also
a
private
remedy.
applying
this
rule
we
cannot
discern
a
statutory
intent
to
create
a
free
standing
private
cause
of
action
to
enforce
regulations
promulgated
under
section
602.
some
of
section
602’s
regulations
of
course
can
piggyback
on
the
cause
of
action
that
we
have
already
recognized
to
enforce
section
601,
regulations
for
example,
that
applies
601’s
ban
on
intentional
discrimination
are
no
doubt
covered
by
the
cause
of
action
to
enforce
that
section.
but
the
disparate-impact
regulations
here
are
of
the
different
kind.
they
do
not
simply
apply
section
601
indeed
they
forbid
conduct
that
section
601
permits
and
must
they
do
not
fall
within
the
private
right
of
action
to
enforce
section
601.
the
private
right
to
enforce
the
regulations
must
therefore
be
grounded
somewhere
else
and
section
602
is
the
only
alternative.
but
section
602
does
not
display
any
intent
to
create
a
private
right
of
action
to
enforce
the
regulations
it
authorizes.
whereas
the
text
of
601
speaks
in
broad
rights-creating
language
and
focuses
on
a
distinct
class
of
protected
individuals,
it
declares
that
no
person
shall
be
subjected
to
discrimination.
the
text
of
602
does
neither
of
these
things,
it
does
not
purport
to
create
new
rights
but
instead
merely
authorizes
federal
agencies
to
“effectuate
the
rights
created
by
section
601”,
and
it
focuses
neither
on
a
protected
class
of
individuals
nor
even
on
the
funding
recipients
being
regulated,
rather
it
focuses
on
the
regulating
agencies.
hence,
under
our
decision
in
cannon
versus
university
of
chicago,
there
is
far
less
reason
here
to
infer
a
private
remedy.
moreover,
section
602
expressly
provides
elaborate
methods
for
agencies
to
enforce
their
regulations,
and
while
we
found
in
cannon
that
these
enforcement
methods
did
not
defeat
the
private
right
of
action
to
enforce
the
statute
created
by
section
601
they
certainly
suggest
that
congress
did
not
intent
to
create
a
separate
private
remedy
to
enforce
the
regulations
alone
through
section
602.
respondents
in
the
united
states
argue
that
the
legal
context
in
which
title
vi
was
enacted
should
lead
us
to
a
different
result,
but
in
determining
whether
statutes
create
private
rights
of
action
as
in
interpreting
statutes
generally
legal
contexts
matters
only
to
the
extent
it
clarifies
text.
finding
no
ambiguity
in
section
602
we
have
no
occasion
to
appeal
to
legal
context.
for
these
reasons
and
others
discussed
in
an
opinion
released
today,
we
hold
that
there
is
no
private
right
of
action
to
enforce
disparate-impact
regulations
promulgated
under
section
602
of
title
vi.
