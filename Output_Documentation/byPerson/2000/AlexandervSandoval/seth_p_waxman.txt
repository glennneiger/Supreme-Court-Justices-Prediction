mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
over
25
years,
courts
have
afforded
injunctive
relief
against
violations
of
title
vi
regulations
against
state
officials
as
well
as
other
public
officials
and
private
officials.
that
practice
is
consistent
with
the
expectations
of
the
congress
that
enacted
title
vi,
particularly
considering
the
legal
and
social
contexts
that
existed
in
1964,
and
successive
congresses
have
validated
the
private
right
of
action.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
among
other
things,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
persistent
practice
of
many
local
jurisdictions
in
evading
the
dictates
of
this
court
and
of
congress
with
respect
to
a
variety
of
civil
rights
issues,
the
most
prominent
one
being--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes,
local
and
state
jurisdictions.
for
example,
the
kind
of
thing
that
prompted
the
voting
rights
act
of
'65.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
are
you
talking
about
against--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--against
states,
or
generally
speaking,
because
the
answer
is
yes--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think
that
it
is
utterly
embedded.
the
cases,
the
decided
cases
are
collected
in
mr....
in
two
appendices
to
mr.
schnapper's
brief,
but
with
respect
to
states
in
particular...
i
mean,
let
me
speak
first
to
the
regulations
issue
and
then
to
the
states
issue,
which
i
take
to
be
the
state
of
alabama's
principal
points.
there
is
no
case
of
which
i
am
aware
in
which
this
court
has
ever
even
suggested,
much
less
held,
that
in
determining
the
scope
of
a
right
of
action,
whether
expressed
or
implied,
that
a
distinction
should
be
made
between
rights
articulated
in
a
statute
itself,
and
rights
articulated
in
substantive
regulations
that
the
statute
mandates
that
the
agency
promulgate.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
this
is
a
separation
of
powers
issue.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
would
like
to
make
two
points,
justice
souter,
in
response
to
that
observation,
with
which
i
agree.
first
of
all,
the
implication
of
drawing
the
kind
of
distinction
that's
been
suggested
here
has
very,
very
broad
ramifications
beyond
enforcement
of
civil
rights
statutes.
if
you
look
at
the
cases,
either
implied
or
under
1983,
in
which
private
parties
have
sought
to
enforce
against
state
agencies
obligations
under
the
medicare
and
medicaid
statutes,
those
are
regulatory
obligations.
the
contemporary
legal
context
in
which
title
vi
and
the
other
civil
rights
provisions
of
the
'64
act
were
enacted,
as
this
court
recognized
in
cannon
and,
in
particular,
in
then-justice
rehnquist's
separate
opinion
in
cannon,
were
enacted
in
a
regime
in
which
it
was
understood
that
legislative
silence
with
respect
to
a
statute
that
created
substantive
rights
for
the
benefit
of
individuals
would
be
enforced
by
the
courts
in
an
implied
right
of
action,
and
that
existed
in
regulatory
cases.
we've
talked
about
borak.
merrill
lynch
was
decided
somewhat
later
in
1982.
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well...
no,
no,
no.
it's
quite
right
that
those
weren't
against
states,
and
mr.
schnapper
has
cited
some
of
the
title
vi
and
title
ix
cases
that
have
operated
against
states.
my
only
point
on
distinguishing
between
regulations
and
statutes
for
purpose
of
implying
a
right
of
action
is
that
you
will
run
into
this
court's
decided
case
law
under
the
medicare
and
medicaid
statutes
whether
under
implied
rights
of
action
or
under
1983,
the
wright,
wilder,
blessing--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--they
were--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
wish
i
were
more
expert
in
medicare
and
medicaid
regulations.
my
understanding--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if--
[laughter]
i
will
gladly
take
guidance
from
you,
justice
scalia,
on
this,
but
i
believe
that
those
statutes,
like
others
in
1983
actions
against
state
officials,
involved
both
substantive
and
interpretive
regulations
and,
of
course,
if
you
were
going
to
draw
a
distinction
here,
it
would
drive
a
wedge
right
through
the
heart
of
this
court's
cases,
including
chrysler
corporation
v.
brown
and
chevron,
that
hold
that
substantive
regulations
that
are
mandated
by
statute
have
the
force
of
law.
let
me
go
to
the
state
point,
the
notion
that
states--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
don't
think
i
can
do
better
than
simply
to
repeat
what
i...
the
point
i
hope
that
i
had
made,
which
is,
there
is
no
case
suggesting
that
for
purposes
of
enforcing
a
spending
clause
obligation
there
is
a
distinction
in
recognizing
a
cause
of
action
based
on
a
statute,
or
on
regulations
that
the
funding
agency
is
mandated
to
put
forward.
the
principle--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--correct.
what
we
have
on
our
side
is,
i
believe,
a
completely
unbroken
practice
of
enforcing
obligations
under
both
the
spending
clause
and
otherwise
equally,
whether
they
arise
within
the
four
corners
of
the
statute,
or
under
substantive
regulations
that
are
mandated
by
the
statute.
now,
i
understand
that
this...
that
our
position
puts
great
weight
on
the
validity
of
these
regulations,
but
that
point,
as
the
court
of
appeals
noted,
was
expressly
conceded
by
the
state
below,
and
we
don't
think
that
it's
at
issue
here.
with
respect
to
the
implication
of
a,
an
implied
private
right
of
action
against
a
state
official,
which
was
mr.
sutton's
first
point,
mr.
schnapper
cited
some
of
the
cases
under
title
vi
and
its
cognate
statutes,
but
i
think
it's
also
important
to
recognize
not
only
the
long
line
of
1983
cases,
many
of
which
enforce
spending
clause
statutes
and
their
regulations
in
injunctive
action,
but
also
the
point
that
justice
kennedy
made
in
his
dissent
in
golden
state
transit
for
himself
and
justice
o'connor
and
the
chief
justice,
which
is
that
there
may
be
instances
in
which
a
healthy
disagreement
may
arise
as
to
whether
a
particular
provision
of
federal
law
creates
a
right,
privilege,
or
immunity,
but
when
what
is
being
sought
is
injunctive
relief,
prospective
relief
only
against
a
state
official,
the
courts
have
long
recognized
a
cause
of
action
under
the
supremacy
clause,
sections
1331
and
2201,
including
in
spending
clause
cases
which
we
have
cited
and
discussed
probably
too
briefly
in
footnote
12
of
our
brief.
cases
like
blum
v.
bacon
and
lead-deadwood
are
spending
clause
cases...
blum
was,
even
involved
a
regulation...
in
which
a
suit
was
brought
by
a
private
party
against
the
state
official
saying,
look,
the
state
has
a
policy.
it's
reflected
in
a
regulation
or
a
statute
that
operates
in
a
manner
that's
inconsistent
with
federal
law
and
therefore
it
is
preempted,
and
the
background
principle,
the
principle
of
law,
i
respectfully
submit,
that
mr.
sutton
is
advocating
runs
directly
contrary
to
the
particular
cases
we
cited
under
title
vi
and
its
cognate
statutes
and
1983,
but
also
this
more
underlying,
long
line
of
cases
that
includes
but
goes
well
beyond
spending
clause
precedents.
our
position
fundamentally
in
this
case
is
that
for
25
years,
it
is
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
not
a
holding
directly
on
point
that
says,
you
may
have
a
private
right
of
action
to
enforce
the
title
vi
regulations,
but
there...
for
25
years
at
least
there
has
been
a
shared
understanding
among
the
three
branches,
reflected
in
a
unanimous
set
of,
body
of
case
law
from
the
federal
courts,
from
successive
congressional
enactments.
in
addition
to
the
attorney's
fees
amendment,
the
rehabilitation
act
amendments,
and
the
civil
rights
restoration
act,
congress
has
enacted
11
cognate
civil
rights
statutes
in
which
the
funding
agencies
are
expressly
directed
to
promulgate
regulations
patterned
after
those
under
title
vi,
all
against
a
backdrop
in
which,
at
least
since
lau
v.
nichols
and
running
up
to
the
present,
implied
rights
of
action
against
state
public
agencies
and
other
public
agencies
have
been
adjudicated,
and
the
executive
branch
across
administrations...
i've
pulled
out
briefs
filed
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
by
my
predecessors,
robert
bork
and
rex
lee,
explaining
to
the
court
that
the
implied
private
right
of
action
to
enforce
these
cases,
and
i
believe
that
the
former
one
was
in
alexander,
which
was
a
case
against
a
state,
are
important
for
the...
an
important
complement
to
federal
enforcement
officials.
our
brief
in
darrone
said,
quote,
the
award
of
individual
relief
to
a
private
litigant
who
has
prosecuted
her
own
suit
is
not
only
sensible
but
is
fully
consistent
with
and,
in
some
cases,
even
necessary
to
the
orderly
enforcement
of
the
statute.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we'll
submit.
