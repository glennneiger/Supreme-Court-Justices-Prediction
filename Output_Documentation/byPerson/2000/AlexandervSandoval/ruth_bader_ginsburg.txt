mr.
sutton,
do
i
understand
what
you
just
told
us
to
mean
that
if
the
cannon
case
had
been
against
the
state
medical
school
instead
of
against
a
private
university
there
would
have
been
no
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
a
different
point,
but
i
wanted
to
know
how
sweeping
your
position
is,
and
you
are
saying
that
if
cannon
had
been
against
the
university
of
illinois
instead
of
the
medical
school
of
the
university
of
chicago,
it
would
have
been
thrown
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
cannon
itself
said
that's...
as
far
as
implied
rights
of
action
it
said,
we
come
from
a
past
when
congress
was
reacting
to
the
courts'
activity
and
knew
that
the
courts
were
implying
private
rights
of
action.
i
thought
cannon
said,
this
much
but
no
further.
congress,
we're
now
putting
you
on
notice
that
henceforth
we
are
not
going
to
imply
private
rights
of
action,
but
we
understand
that
cannon
comes
from
a
different
milieu,
and
we're
going
to...
not
going
to
change
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
explain,
mr.
sutton,
the
impact
in
the
civil
rights
remedies,
equalization
act
that
i
thought
waived
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
for
title
vi,
title
ix...
and
504
cases,
no?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
were
stating
sweepingly
that
when
you
answered
my
question,
cannon
was
under
the
basic
prohibition,
not
against--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right,
and
you
said
there
would
be
no
such
claim,
but
now
i
think
you're
amending
that,
because
you
said
after
the
'86
act
there
would
be.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
same
true
of
rule
14?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
proxy
rules,
the
statute
and
the
proxy
rules,
is
the
same...
what
you're
saying
now
true--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--where
i
thought
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
rule,
the
regulation
there,
the
rule
went
beyond
the
statute.
it
was
kind
of
like
a
prophylactic,
and
i
don't
know...
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
if
there
is
any
other
instance
of
splitting
the
regulation
from
the
statute.
i
mean,
the
private
right
of
action,
the
10(b)(5)
action,
the
rule
14
action,
they're
all
wedded
to
a
statutory
text,
and
as
far
as
i
know
there's
no
distinction
between,
oh,
i'm
bringing
it
under
rule
10(b)
and
not...
rather
than
the
statute,
or
rule
14
rather
than
the
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
on
your
argument
that
the
regulation
is
invalid.
if
the
regulation
is
valid,
then
it
seems
to
me
we
just
decide
rule
14.
