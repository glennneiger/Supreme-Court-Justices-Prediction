justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true,
but
you
do...
in
your
view,
is
this...
do
i
have
your
argument
correct
that
there'll
be
a
certain
number
of
civil
rights
statutes
where,
in
respect
to
an
implied
right
of
action,
there
is
basically
silence,
and
do
you
think
there
could
be
a
number
of
those
statutes
where
you
would
imply
from
that
silence
a
private
right
of
action
against
an
individual
but
not
against
a
state?
that's
your
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
your
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
that's
your
view,
then
you're
reading
a
lot
of
complication
into
the
silence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
you're
reading
all
that
into
a
silence,
so
if
you're
going
to
read
that
much
complication
into
the
silence,
why
not
read
into
it
that
you
could
bring
injunctive
actions
but
not
damage
actions,
given
the
eleventh
amendment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
authority
for
that
kind
of
interpretation
of
a
silence
that
we
get
out
of
the
silence
actions
against
a
private
person
but
not
actions
against
the
state?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
other
words,
you're
saying
that
if
you
take
the
silence...
this
is...
i'm
trying
to
follow
the
complicated...
if
you
take
the
silence,
and
if
you...
you
either
read
the
silence
as
a
whole,
just
private
rights
of
action
against
states
and
individuals
for
damages
and
injunctions,
or
you
try
to
create
epicycles,
or
split
the
atom,
if
you're
going
to
split
that
atom
of
silence,
and
if
you
split
it
to
distinguish
between
state
and
private
defendants,
then
you
should
also
split
the
state
defendants
to
distinguish
between
injunctive
actions
and
damage
actions.
at
least,
that's
what
you'd
have
authority
for
under
case
law,
because
you
have
some
cases,
injunctions
versus
states,
and
you
have
other
cases,
damages
versus
private.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
say
anything
about...
it's
35
years,
and
you
said
in
35
years
everyone
has
assumed
that
there
is
a
private
right
of
action
for
injunctive
relief
based
on
a
regulation
under
title
vi,
but
have
there
only
been
like
one
or
two
in
35
years,
or
have
there
been
a
lot,
or
is
this
the
first
time
it's
come
up,
or
the
second
time,
or--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
can
say
anything--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
let's
say
against
a
governmental
body,
however
you
want
to
answer
it.
i'm
just
trying
to
get
an
empirical
idea
of
whether
people
really...
this
really
is
embedded
in
the
public
mind
or
not.
