mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
points
that
i
would
like
to
make
this
morning.
the
first
is
that
it
is
never
appropriate
for
a
branch
of
the
federal
government
to
imply
the
creation
of
a
private
right
of
action
under
the
spending
power.
the
second
is
that,
regardless
of
the
participation
of
the
state
as
a
defendant
in
this
case,
the
court's
implied
right-of-action
doctrine
does
not
extend
to
these
disparate
effect
regulations.
let
me
start
with
the
first
point.
in
case
after
case
over
the
last
two
to
three
decades
the
court
has
made
clear
that
states
are
not
run-of-the-mill
civil
defendants.
they
are
not
mere
interest
groups.
they
are
coequal
sovereigns
and,
as
a
result,
the
court
has
not
lightly
inferred
that
congress
means
to
regulate
the
states
as
states,
to
regulate
in
core
areas
of
local
sovereignty,
or,
as
here,
to
expose
the
states
to
a
private
right
of
action.
those
principles
are
particularly
critical
when
it
comes
to
the
spending--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--that's
true,
your
honor.
that's
exactly--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
exactly,
your
honor
and,
of
course,
the
eleventh
amendment
applies
even
to
injunctive
relief
and
even,
as
this
particular
case
reveals,
you
can
still
alter
the
federal-state
balance
by
allowing
private
rights
of
action.
indeed,
in
cannon,
the
court
distinguished
a
case
not
unlike
this
one
on
just
this
ground.
in
cannon,
in
footnote
13,
the
court
reviewed
many
of
the
implied
right-of-action
cases
it
had
decided,
and
it
looked
at
a
case
called
santa
clara
pueblo,
a
case
in
which
the
court
had
not
implied
a
right
of
action
against
a
tribe,
and
for
that...
and
the
reason
it
did
not
imply
a
right
of
action
was
because
tribes
are
sovereigns.
now,
they're
statutory
sovereigns,
whereas
states
are
constitutional
sovereigns.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
right,
and
it
would
have
been...
of
course,
it's
an
even
harder
claim
here,
because
this
claim
is
under
regulations,
which
is
something
the
court
has
never
inferred
before
from
congressional
actions.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that's
true,
and
that
is
our
first
principal
point.
and
i
think,
your
honor,
it
follows
from
all
of
the
cases...
i
mean,
whether
you
look
at
gregory
v.
ashcroft,
atascadero,
or
south
dakota
v.
dole,
pennhurst,
all
of
those
cases
made
clear,
when
you
alter
the
federal-state
balance
congress
has
to
be
unmistakable
in
what
it's
doing,
and
in
this
case
it
was
anything
but
unmistakable.
everyone
agrees--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--but,
your
honor,
states
are
different.
the
court...
the
only
case
that's
been
identified
so
far
by
respondents
involving
what
seems
to
be
an
oxymoron,
implied
right
of
action
against
the
state,
is
the
allen
case
from
1969.
that
was
not
a
spending
clause
case,
point
number
1,
but
point
number
2,
more
importantly,
that's
a
case
that
falls
under
this
case's...
this
court's
decisions,
specifically
atascadero,
where
you
can
have
an
overwhelming
implication
in
the
statute
that
a
right
of
action
was
created.
in
allen,
had
there
not
been
a
right
of
action,
the
individuals
would
not
have
been
able
to
enforce
other
parts
of
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
that
case
is
not
a
classic
implied
right-of-action
case
where
there's
no
suggestion
in
the
statute
that
congress
meant
to
create
a
right
of
action.
in
this
case,
it's
just
the
opposite.
here,
congress
did
create
a
right
of
action,
just
not
by
private
individuals,
by
agencies,
so
you
said
my
first
proposition
is
a
sweeping
one,
and
perhaps
it
is,
but
there
are
not
a
lot
of
cases
recognizing
the
implied
right-of-action
doctrine
against
states.
i
mean,
that's
not
something
the
court
has
been
doing.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
that
may
be
true,
your
honor,
but
i
did--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--it
is
my
view,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
the
reason
you're
saying
that
is
because
states
will
be
treated
differently
from
other
litigants
in
the
statutes?
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
as
justice
powell
said
in
atascadero,
states
are
different.
i
mean,
to
quote
him
at
page
246,
given
their
constitutional
role,
the
states
are
not
like
any
other
class
of
recipients
of
federal
aid.
that's
exactly
the
premise
for
the
court's
clear
statement
decisions.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
that's
exactly
atascadero,
where
you
could
get
money
damages
actions
against
private
individuals
under
section
504,
but
not
against
states,
so
there
is
authority
for
that
exact
point.
but
i
do
want
to
go
back
to,
i
think
a
premise
in
your
question,
which
is
that
this
argument
is
somehow
sweeping
because
there
are
lots
of
other
civil
rights
statutes
where
somehow
there
would
not
now
be
a
right
of
action
against
the
state,
and
we're
concerned
about
that.
i
don't
think
that's
true,
however.
i
don't
know
what
those
statutes
are.
no
one's
pointed
them
out.
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
itself,
congress
was
very
explicit
when
it
wanted
either
private
rights
of
action,
as
in
title
ii
or
title
vii,
or
ag
enforcement
actions,
as
in
title
iii
and
title
iv.
title
vi--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--that's
true,
your
honor,
but
as
i
pointed
out,
in
cannon,
in
footnote
13,
the
court
has
already
dealt
with
this
very
issue.
santa
clara
pueblo
was
a
case
that
was
an
ex
parte
young
action
against
a
tribe.
what
the
statute
in
that
case
said
is,
we
create
an
express
right
of
action
for
habeas
corpus
relief.
it
said
nothing
else
under
the
indian
civil
rights
act.
that
was
the
statute
at
issue.
the
court
said,
in
light
of
the
silence,
in
light
of
the
express
creation
of
one
cause
of
action,
silence
about
any
other
one,
and
in
light
of
the
sovereignty
of
the...
the
statutory
sovereignty
of
tribes,
we're
not
going
to
imply
a
right
of
action.
that's
cannon
itself,
and
that
is
this
case.
if
you
don't
imply
rights
of
action
casually
against
statutory
sovereigns,
you
surely
don't
do
it
against
constitutional
sovereigns.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
you're
referring
to
the
1986
rehabilitation
act
amendments?
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
that's
a
very
good
point,
and
we're
very
sympathetic
to
it,
but
i
just
want
to
clarify
one
thing.
that
point
goes
to
the
application
of
the
standard
i'm
advocating.
it
does
not
contest
the
standard,
because
what
happens
in
1986
is,
congress
shows
it
understands
this
dialogue
between
the
court
and
congress
as
to
what
is
required
before
you
regulate
the
states
in
these
areas,
and
i
think
there's
a
very
good
argument
that
congress
was
express
in
1986
that
there
were
causes
of
action
against
states,
but
conspicuously
missing
from
those
amendments
is
any
indication
that
they
were
causes
of
action
under
regulations,
as
opposed
to
the
statutory
antidiscrimination--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--title
ix.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
under
901,
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well
then,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
i
thought
you
were
referring
to
all
other
cases.
i
mean,
in
other
words,
all
statutes
that
are
silent
about
creating
a
private
right
of
action,
and
i'm
acknowledging
the
argument
is
sweeping
in
that
respect.
it
applies
to
all
statutes.
you
are
right,
after
1986,
when
it
comes
to
section
504,
title
ix
and
title
vi,
the
argument's
not
sweeping
at
all
when
it
comes
to
the
antidiscrimination
mandate,
because,
as
respondents
have
argued,
in
1986
congress
picked
up
on
the
dialogue
and
said,
we
are
going
to
create
an
express
right
of
action,
so
when
it
comes
to
intentional
discrimination,
that
which
is
barred
by
title
vi
or
title
ix,
there
is
a
right
of
action.
but
the
critical
failing
with
that
particular
argument,
and
i
think
that's
why
it's
really
not
being
relied
upon
by
respondents,
is
congress
says
nothing
at
all
about
rights
of
action
under
regulations,
which
you
know,
after
all,
is
an
extraordinary
concept.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
in
this
particular
case?
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
i
think,
as
this
court
has
said,
cities
are
different
from
states.
i
mean,
in
my
view,
cities
are...
they're
statutory
sovereigns.
they're
state--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--there
would
be
with
respect
to
the
first
argument
i'm
making,
but
let
me
switch
now
to
the
second
argument
we're
making,
where
i
do
not
think
there
would
be
a
right
of
action
against
a
city,
county,
or
for
that
matter,
a
private
person.
when
one
looks
at
all
of
the
court's
implied
right-of-action
cases
whether
it's
1964
in
the
borak
decision,
or
cannon,
or
more
recent
decisions,
they
all
start
with
and
agree
that
the
most
important
point
is
congressional
intent,
congressional
meaning
and
design.
there
are
several
indicators
in
title
vi
that
congress
did
not
mean
to
imply
the
creation
of
a
private
right
of
action
under
the
section
602
regulations.
the
first
is
that
as
this
case
comes
to
the
court
there's
no
doubt
what
the
antidiscrimination
mandate
means.
everyone
agrees.
no
one's
contesting
bakke,
fordice,
for
the
view
that
601
only
prescribes
what
the
equal
protection
clause
prescribes,
so
first
of
all
it's
a
very
unusual
way
for
congress
to
work,
to
prescribe
one
type
of
state
action
or
city,
county
action
and
then
somehow
implicitly
create
a
cause
of
action
with
an
entirely
different
standard
of
review.
the
second
indicator
of
congressional
intent,
it
may
be
helpful
to
look
at
the
statute
itself,
and
if
you
look
at...
if
you're
interested,
if
you
look
at
page
1
and
2
of
the
blue
brief,
our
opening
brief,
i'd
like
to
point
out
some
language
that
i
think
is...
well,
we're
obviously
a
little
biased,
but
close
to
dispositive
on
this
particular
point.
if
you're
relying
on
section
602
to
implicitly
create
this
cause
of
action,
you've
got
to
read
all
of
section
602.
granted,
it
does
create
rulemaking
authority
for
the
agencies,
but
if
you
look
on
page
2...
it's
about
eight
or
nine
lines
down,
the
beginning
of
a
new
sentence...
you
have
the
sentence
that
says,
compliance
with
any
requirement
adopted
pursuant
to
this
section
may
be
affected,
so
once
again,
compliance
with
any
requirement
adopted
in
accordance
with
this
section.
in
other
words,
section
602
does
give
rulemaking
authority
to
agencies,
but
it
then
says,
if
you
want
to
enforce
those
rules,
here's
how
you
do
it,
and
the
here's
how
you
do
it
creates
special
rules
when
it
comes
to
termination
of
funding--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--exactly,
your
honor,
and
this
is
critical.
the
second
possibility
for
getting
compliance
with
these
rules
is
by
any
other
means
authorized
by
law
and,
as
the
federal
government
acknowledged
in
its
brief,
i
think
at
page
11,
that
includes,
for
example,
injunctive
relief
so,
for
example,
under
that,
at
a
minimum
all
agree
an
agency
could
come
in
and
enjoin
the
state
conduct,
for
example,
the
way
alabama
is
administering
its
driver's
licenses.
but
here's
now
the
critical
second
statutory
point.
you
then
have
this
proviso,
exactly
after
the
line
that
justice
o'connor
has
quoted,
that
now
says
that
no
such
action...
the
such
is
obviously
referring
to
everything
they've
discussed
so
far...
says,
shall
be
taken
until
the
department
or
agency
concerned
has
advised
the
appropriate
persons,
here
the
alabama
department
of
public
safety,
of
the
failure
to
comply
with
a
requirement,
has
determined
that
compliance
cannot
be
secured
by
voluntary
means.
how
in
the
world
could
a
private
individual
establish
that
a
state
is
in
compliance
with
a
federal
agency
rule?
that's
not
something
they
have--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--but
your
honor,
let's
take
the
most
virtuous
and
earnest
state
attorney
general.
they're
faced
with
one
of
these
private
enforcement
actions,
and
the
private
litigant
does
what
you're
suggesting.
they
first
put
them
on
notice.
they
send
a
letter,
listen,
we
don't
think
what
you're
doing
is
permissible
under
this
rule--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--and
the
point...
i
guess
the
point
i'm
making
is
that,
take
the
ideal
state
attorney
general.
they
get
this
lawsuit,
and
the
private
individual
says,
listen,
we'd
like
to
give
you
an
opportunity
to
voluntarily
comply,
and
here's
how
we
suggest
you
do
it.
what
assurance,
what
guarantee
is
there
that
the
state
is
now
in
compliance
with
a
federal
agency's
rules
that
this--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--it
does,
your
honor,
and
you're...
this
is
a
better
point
than
the
one
i'm
making
in
response
to
justice
souter.
that
language
makes
it
clear
who
is
the
one
that's
doing
the
advising,
and
if
we're
going
to
draw
any
inferences
from
this
statutory
scheme,
it's
an
inference
that
whatever
could
be
done
under
section
601,
under
section
602,
that
was
an
enforcement
provision
for
agencies,
enforcement
provision
in
the
sense
that
they
could
promulgate
rules
to
effectuate
section
601,
and
then
they
could
go
about
enforcing
them,
but
as
the
chief
justice's
question
points
out,
it
is
the
federal
department
or
agency
that
they're
referring
to.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
oh,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
here's
the
reason
i
read
it
this
way,
and
i
want
to
make
sure
i'm
answering
your
question--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--i
think
there's
a
very
good
argument
that
there's
an
overwhelming
implication
after
1986
that
there
is
a
cause
of
action
under
section
601.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
are
you
referring
to
602,
or
601?
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
i
think
there's
a
very
good
argument
that
there
is
an
express
cause
of
action
for
all
of
title
vi.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
after
1986,
so
post
cannon.
i
think
that
there
is
a
very
good
argument
for
that.
again,
it
requires
implications,
but
i
think
that
falls
under
the
atascadero
point
that
it
has
to,
if
it's
a
sufficiently
overwhelming
implication,
then
we're
going
to
recognize
it.
after
all,
in
1986
they
didn't
create
a
right
of
action.
all
they
did
is,
they
said,
we're
abrogating
the
state
immunity.
but
i
want
to
make
sure
i'm
understanding
a
point
that
i'm
not
sure
i
addressed,
and
this
goes
back
to
the
compliance
sentence
about
nine
lines
down
on
page
2.
it
says,
compliance
with
any
requirement
adopted
according
to
this
section,
and
i
don't
know
how
one
can
read
that
to
say,
you
don't
follow
these
rules
when
you
try
to
obtain
compliance.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
but
it's--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
maybe
this
is
my
confusion.
when
it
says,
any
requirement
adopted
according
to
this
section,
the
requirement's
referring
to
the
rules.
section
602
does
two
things.
it
says,
you
can
promulgate
rules,
number
1,
and
number
2
you
can
go
out
and
enforce
them,
and
it
does
seem
to
me
that
that
requirement
language
is
referring
to
the
requirements
promulgated
under
the
section,
and
so--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--i
may
be
wrong.
i
may
be
wrong,
but
that
is
the
way
we
think
we
read
it,
and
we
certainly
think,
given
the
requirement
of
clarity,
at
a
minimum
it's
not
ambiguous
the
other
way.
i
mean,
that
seems
to
me
quite
striking.
if
i
could
shift
to
a
few
other
points,
there
are
some
other
indicators--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--no,
your
honor,
we
do
not,
and
we
think
the
better
reading
is
that
these
regulations
are
invalid,
but
as
we
indicated
in
our
opening
brief
and
our
reply,
we
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
address
the
validity
of
the
regulations.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
your
honor,
and
that's
a
possibility,
but
you
still
have
the
problem
of
rules
of
the
language
in
section
602
that
i
just
referred
to
that
suggest
indicates
that
all
of
those
rules
were
rules
that
agencies
were
to
enforce,
not
private
individuals,
so
even
if
you
decided...
and
i
don't
think
you
need
to
decide
this,
but
even
if
you
decide
the
rules
were
valid,
it
would
still
be
rules
that
could
be
enforced
by
the
agencies.
in
other
words,
if
you
thought--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--absolutely.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
i
don't
think
anyone
agrees...
i
mean,
i
want
to
be
clear
but
i
don't
think
anyone
agrees
that
this
suit
can
be
characterized
as
being
under
601.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
and
the
reason,
the
reason
is
that
the
court
has
already
made
clear
that
section
601
does
not
cover
disparate-effect
legislation
and,
as
justice
o'connor
and
justice
powell
indicated
in
guardians,
one
does
not
effectuate
a
statutory
antidiscrimination
mandate
by
redefining
it.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
no.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
respectfully,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
the
most
that
can
be
said
is
that
you
would
be
enforcing
at
that
point
section
602,
and
section
602
is
the
part
of
the
statute
that
gives
the
agencies
rulemaking
authority.
i
mean,
that's
the
way
respondents
have
characterized
their
action,
that's
the
way
the
lower
court
characterized
their
action.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
that
is
possible.
in
other
words--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--that's
true,
and
that's
not
the
way
the
case
has
been
argued,
but
if
that
were
true,
then
i
think
it's
fair
you
would
need
to
look
at
whether
that's
a
legitimate
interpretation
of
section
601.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
absolutely
not,
because
chevron
deference--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--that's
exactly
right,
and
there's
some
guidance
in
the
court's
cases.
in
fact,
it
even
comes
from
the
line
of
authority
in
which
respondents
are
relying,
and
that's
the
securities
cases.
there
have
been
many
cases
under
section
10(b)
and
under
rule
10(b)(5)
where
plaintiffs
have
attempted
to
bring
a
cause
of
action
that
broadens
section
10(b).
the
most
notable
of
them
is
central
bank
from
six
terms
ago.
another
one,
ernst
&
ernst
v.
hockhelder
in
1976
were
both
situations
in
which
the
private
litigants
attempted
to
create
a
cause
of
action
to
rule
10(b)(5),
which
actually
has
an
even
broader
source
of
statutory
authority,
and
the
court
rejected
them
because
they
created
a
cause
of
action
that
contained
fewer
elements
than
the
statutory
right
of
action,
and
i
think
that's
a
good
analogy
here.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
excuse
me?
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
your
honor,
that,
of
course,
is
the
hagen
case
that
you
wrote
for
the
court
in
1997--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--under
rule...
i
want
to
make
sure
i'm
answering
your
question.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
under
rule
14(e)(3)
you've
got
a
different
statutory
authorization
of
rulemaking
power.
there,
the
operative
language
is
that
the
agency
can
promulgate
rules
that,
quote,
prevent
the
underlying
prohibition.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
i
couldn't
agree
more,
and
i
don't
think
there
is
precedent
for
that
point.
i
mean,
that,
i
think,
is
our
main
point,
that
if
the
case
comes
to
court,
we
all
know
what
section
601
means,
and
that's
why
they
have
to
characterize--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--but
your
honor,
the
implied
right
of
action
inquiry
is
an
inquiry
that
goes
really
to
the
same
question
that
you
ask
when
you
decide
whether
an
agency
rule
is
valid,
and
that's
what
did
congress
mean,
what
did
congress
authorize
here,
so
it's
true,
if
there's
not
an
implied
right
of
action
it
may
make
these
regulations
of
dubious
validity,
but
that's
not
necessarily
true.
the
federal
government--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--if
the
regulations
are
invalid,
that's
true.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
that...
it
is
our...
we
do
think
they're
not
valid,
but
i
want
to
make
clear,
we
think
that's
a
harder--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
that
is
one
way
to
proceed,
and
we've
argued
that
they're
not
valid.
that
is
an
easier
way
to
proceed.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
that's
a
harder
case,
your
honor,
but
the
reason...
i
think
the
way
to
look
at
it
is,
does
the
text
unambiguously
create
this
right.
if
the
text
doesn't
do
it,
i
don't
know
how
a
rule
can
do
it
by--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--your
honor,
you're
right.
let
me--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--this
question
gets
to
the
distinction
between
my
first
argument
and
my
second.
when
it
comes
to
the
creation
of
an
implied
right
of
action
against
the
state,
the
court
has
always
said
it's
about
what's
in
the
text,
so
if
the
state
is
a
defendant,
then
i
stick
with
what
i
just
said.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
if
it's
a
private
party,
city,
or
county,
then
i
do
not.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
that's
exactly
right.
if
i
could
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
a
few
brief
points,
your
honor.
in
terms
of
the
question
of
what
vantage
point
the
court
uses
in
looking
at
this
issue,
there
are
many
cases
from
the
eighties
and
nineties
where
the
court
has
not
looked
to
the
date
on
which
the
statute
was
enacted
for
determining
whether
it's
an
applied
right
of
action.
touche-ross,
involving
the
1934
securities
act,
is
the
very
same
statute
that
borak
involved,
and
it
didn't
look
back
in
time.
it
followed
what
the
court
was
doing
at
that
point
in
time.
the
true
is...
the
same
is
true
of
transamerica,
california
v.
sierra
club,
and
northwest
airlines.
even
cannon
itself
applied
the
court
v.
ash
test
which
came
4
years
after
title
ix.
now,
as
for
the
question
whether
guardians
has
resolved
this,
the
last
thing
that
guardians
resolved
was
the
question
of
whether
there
was
an
applied
right
of
action.
even
if
one
allowed
for
the
counting
of
dissents
and
plurality
votes,
you
only
had
two
justices
agreeing
there
was
an
implied
private
right
of
action
in
guardians,
so
that
surely
was
not
decided
there.
and
the
notion
that
pre-1983
there
were
settled
expectations
on
this
point
can't
possibly
be
true.
look
at
justice
marshall's
opinion
in
guardians.
footnote
1
identifies
the
split
in
lower
court
authority
on
the
very
question
the
court
tried
to
resolve
but
didn't,
so
that
doesn't
seem
possible.
as
far
as
the
preemption
cases
that
the
federal
government
is
relying
on,
i
think
it's
footnote
11
or
12
in
its
brief,
that's
a
very
different
issue.
the
question
of
whether
a
properly
promulgated
rule
would
preempt
state
law
is
one
issue.
it's
a
second
issue
whether
a
private
individual
can
enforce
it.
i
have
no
other
points.
thank
you,
your
honor.
