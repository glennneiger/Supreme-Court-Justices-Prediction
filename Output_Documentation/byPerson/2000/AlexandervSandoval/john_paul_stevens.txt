mr.
sutton,
do
you
think
the
word
compliance
talks
about
private
actions
as
well
as
actions
by
the
federal
government?
i
always
thought
that
sentence
referred
to
compliance
may
be
effected,
as
by
the
federal
government
may
be
effecting
this,
but
that
isn't
talking
about
private
actions,
is
it?
do
you
think--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
read
it
that
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though...
do
you
think
there's
an
express
cause
of
action,
rather
than
an
implied
cause
of
action
under
title
vi?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
there's
an
express
cause
of
action
under
title
vi?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
that's
not
my
question.
the
question
is,
do
you
think
there's
an
express
cause
of
action,
as
opposed
to
one
that
we
found
in
cannon
that
congress
intended
to
imply
a
cause
of
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
602.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
one
could
read
it
to
say,
that
sentence
just
refers
to
actions
instituted
by
the
federal
government--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--compliance
actions,
which
is
a
fairly
normal
way
to
refer
to
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
why
do
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
i
understand
your
argument,
you're
saying
even
the
federal
government
couldn't
bring
this
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
your
position
is,
they
are
invalid,
therefore
the
government
couldn't
bring
this
action,
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
wouldn't
need
to
worry
about
all
the
argument
about
implied
cause
of
action
and
all
the
rest
if
the
regulation's
invalid.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
that
is
joined
by
justice
souter,
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
breyer,
because
it
is
a
rather
long
opinion
i
shall
just
make
a
few
brief
points.
the
civil
rights
act
that
we
construe
today
was
enacted
in
1964.
a
few
years
later
this
court
decided
a
case
raising
a
claim
identical
in
all
relevant
particulars
the
one
brought
in
this
suit.
the
unanimous
court
held
that
private
plaintiffs
might
proceed
with
that
claim.
in
their
concurring
opinion
in
that
case
lau
against
nichols,
justice
stewart,
chief
justice
burger
and
justice
blackmun,
cogently
and
correctly
analyze
the
precise
question
the
court
addresses
today.
in
the
intervening
years
the
courts
of
appeals
have
also
repeatedly
answered
today’s
question.
in
case
after
case
those
courts
have
held
without
exception
that
the
disparate-impact
regulations
promulgated
under
title
vi
are
enforceable
in
private
actions.
given
the
fact
that
the
law
in
this
area
was
well-settled
and
that
those
cases
were
correctly
decided,
there
was
no
need
for
this
court
to
grant
certiorari
in
this
case.
the
courts
of
appeals
relied
heavily
and
the
reasoning
in
our
opinion
in
cannon
against
the
university
of
chicago.
in
that
case
we
noted
that
our
evaluation
of
congressional
action
must
take
into
account
its
contemporary
legal
context.
we
held
that
even
though
the
statute
did
not
say
so
in
so
many
words,
it
was
clear
that
congress
intended
to
authorize
private
actions
to
enforce
the
regulatory
scheme
contained
in
titles
vi
and
ix
of
the
civil
rights
act.
today
the
court
relies
on
arguments
advanced
in
the
dissenting
opinions
in
cannon.
it
puts
the
majority's
opinion
in
that
case
to
one
side
on
the
remarkable
ground
that
cannon’s
holding
applies
only
to
cases
involving
intentional
discrimination
and
therefore,
it
sheds
no
light
on
this
disparate-impact
case.
in
doing
so
however,
the
court
simply
ignores
the
long
description
of
the
actual
claim
in
cannon
in
which
the
plaintiff
had
alleged
that
medical
school
policies
that
disfavored
applicants
who
were
more
than
35
years
old
had
a
disparate-impact
on
females,
because
the
incidents
of
interrupted
higher
education
is
higher
among
women
than
among
men.
in
other
words,
despite
what
the
court
now
says
about
the
holding
in
cannon
it
was
in
fact
a
typical
disparate-impact
case.
moving
beyond
precedent
the
court’s
position
defies
simple
logic.
the
court
acknowledges
that
our
prior
cases
recognize
the
private
right
of
action
to
enforce
title
vi
antidiscrimination
mandate
and
accepts
for
the
purposes
of
today’s
decision
that
the
regulations
at
issue
in
this
case
are
validly
promulgated
measures
to
effectuate
the
statutory
goal.
given
those
propositions
the
answer
to
the
question
presented
should
be
so
evident.
it
strains
credulity
to
think
that
congress
would
have
without
saying
so,
intended
to
make
available
a
right
of
action
to
enforce
some
of
the
regulations
promulgated
under
title
vi
but
not
others.
i
mention
these
details
to
identify
the
character
of
the
arguments
that
court
has
advanced
in
an
attempt
to
justify
its
parsimonious
construction
of
a
very
important
statute.
for
reasons
stated
at
greater
length
in
my
written
opinion,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
both
precedent
in
reason
provide
powerful
support
for
the
conclusion
that
the
,congress
that
enacted
title
vi
in
1964,
intended
to
authorize
private
actions
to
enforce
all
regulations
validly
promulgated
under
that
title.
