well,
let's
assume
that
the
regulations
are
permitted.
make
that
assumption.
that,
then,
is
simply
an
implementation
of
601.
i
mean,
it
has
to
be
or
we
have
a
delegation
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
substantive
obligation
that
the
state
must
meet
is
a
601
obligation,
as
interpreted
by
the
agency
under
602.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
can't
you
say
the
suit
is
under
601?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand
that,
but
i
want
to
know
why.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
once
the
regulation
is
in
place,
doesn't
the
statute
then
have
a
new
meaning,
as
interpreted
by
the
agency?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
else
why
does
the
agency
have
authority
to
do
this
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
a
preventative
measure?
