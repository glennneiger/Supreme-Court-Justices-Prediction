well,
one
way
the
two
could
be
reconciled,
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it's
the
best
way,
but
one
way
to
reconcile
them
would
be
to
say
that
the
private
right
of
action
is
contingent
upon
the
states
having
taken
the
steps
in
the
proviso,
so
that
until
the
state
had
notified,
and
until
there
had
been
some
conclusion
drawn
that
voluntary
compliance
would
not
be
reached
in
the
absence
of
action,
the
private
party
could
not
seek
the
injunction.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
was
suggesting
something
perhaps
even
more
awkward.
i
was
suggesting
that
the
private
litigant
couldn't
go
ahead
until
the
state
agency
had
said,
you
know,
you're
out
of
compliance,
and
the
state
agency
had
come
to
some
conclusion
that
voluntary
compliance
was
in
fact
not
feasible.
at
that
point
the
individual
could
then
go
ahead
with
the
suit,
and
one
of
the
predicates
for
the
private
injunctive
suit
would
be,
the
state
has
tried
to
get
voluntary
compliance
and
it
can't.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i...
actually,
as
i
guess
my
question
implied,
i
think
that
is
certainly
the
easier
reading,
but
i
guess
i
also
think
that
if
we
felt
otherwise
impelled
to
recognize
the
private
action
here
based
on
other
principles,
i
don't
suppose
this
would
necessarily
stand
in
the
way
of
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
cannon,
cannon
did
not
involve
the
regulation,
right?
it
involved...
that
was
a
claim
under
the
substantive
standard
itself,
whether...
i
think
it
was
a
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
did
either
of
those
cases
involve
regulations
as
the
immediate
premise
for
the
suit?
justice
david
h.
souter
both
did?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
one--
justice
david
h.
souter
--general,
i
may...
i
think
i
agree
with
the
proposition
you
start
with,
but
one
reason
to
look
at
it
differently
now
would
be
this.
we
have...
since
the
statute
was
passed,
we
have
taken
a
different
and
at
least
in
the
minds
of
some
of
us
a
more
realistic
view
of
the
circumstances
in
which
you
really
can
in
fact
infer
a
congressional
intent
to
provide...
to
recognize
a
private
right
of
action,
so
we're
trying
to
preserve
congress'
expectations
with
respect
to
the
law
that
was
passed
under
the
earlier
regime,
but
it's
also
sensible
for
us
not
to
expand
that
earlier
regime
any
further
than
it
necessarily
has
to
go
based
upon
the
precedent
that
the
congress
might
have
assumed.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
therefore
there
may
be
a
good
reason
simply
because
this
is
no
longer
the
world
of
case
and
borak,
to
draw
just
the
kind
of
distinction
which
you
point
out
we
never
have
drawn
before,
but
which
we
have
never
recognized,
which
we
have
never
precluded
drawing
before.
justice
david
h.
souter
my
only
thought,
they
may
have
the
force
of
law,
but
they
may
not
have
the
force
of
the
unequivocal
for
purposes
of
the
spending
clause.
