mr.
eric
schnapper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
proposing
substantial
changes
in
the
law
in
a
number
of
distinct
areas.
first,
they
characterize
this
case
as
involving
a
fundamental
change
in
federal-state
relations
requiring
a
particularly
clear
and
explicit
statement
that
congress
intends
to
do
that.
this
is
a
classic
ex
parte
young
injunction.
it's
an
injunction
against
mr.
alexander
in
his
official
capacity
to
restrain
future
violations
of
the
law.
this
court
held
in
will
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
remedy
that
is
not--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--in
will
v.
department
of
corrections,
that
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
legislation
that
does
not
fundamentally
disturb
federal-state
relations,
and
i
think
the
whole
line
of
cases
since
ex
parte
young
simply
could
not
survive
if
that
were
the
law.
secondly--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--i...
to
which
i'm
about
to
turn.
they...
mr.
sutton
next
suggests
that
there
cannot
be
an
implied
cause
of
action
in
spending
clause
legislation,
that
any
cause
of
action
in
spending
clause
legislation
has
to
be
explicit.
if
that
is
right,
cannon
and
guardians
were
wrongly
decided.
they
are
spending
clause
legislation,
guardians
is
this
very
statute.
they
both
recognize
an
implied
cause
of
action,
and
that
whole
line
of
cases
would
have
to
be
overruled.
mr.
eric
schnapper
title
ix.
mr.
eric
schnapper
title
ix.
mr.
eric
schnapper
strictly
spending
clause.
mr.
eric
schnapper
the
specific
claim
in
cannon
was
actually
an
effect
claim.
the
plaintiff
was
a
woman
who
asserted
that
the
university's
practice
of
rejecting
medical
school
applicants
over
a
particular
age
had
a
discriminatory
effect.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes,
i
understand.
i
understand.
mr.
eric
schnapper
it's
not--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--i'm
about
to
turn
to
the
state
issue,
but
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
the...
i
think
the
spending
clause
argument
is,
as
they
make
it,
would
encompass
private
defendants.
mr.
eric
schnapper
if
the
spending
clause
rules
are
limited
in
that
fashion,
then
that
would
be
correct.
i'm
not...
but
then
there--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--well,
if
you
conclude,
were
to
conclude
that
the
spending
clause
limitations
don't
apply
to
private
parties
or
to
cities
at
all,
then
you...
then
that
problem
would
be
solved,
but
the
next
problem
would
not,
because
this
court
has
been
applying
this
implied
cause
of
action
to
state
defendants.
it
did
so
in
bazemore
v.
friday,
and
in
alexander
v.
choate.
those
were
classic
ex
parte
young
injunctions
against
state
officials,
and
the
court
had
no
hesitation
in
applying
it.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
it
assumed
it,
as
have
the
lower
courts
for
years.
i
mean,
this
is
an
established
part
of
the
fabric
of
the
law,
and
it
has
been
for
many
years.
mr.
eric
schnapper
both.
mr.
eric
schnapper
in
bazemore
we
relied
on
a
title
vi
regulation,
and
in
alexander
we
relied
on
a
section
504
regulation.
mr.
eric
schnapper
right.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that
is
right.
in
our
view,
the
provisions
of
the
eleventh
amendment
and
the
sort
of
penumbra
of
the
eleventh
amendment
issue
in
will
exhaust
the
federalism
problems
that
are
applicable
in
a
situation
like
this,
and
when
you
get
to
an
ex
parte
young
injunction
that
problem
no
longer
exists.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--yes.
mr.
eric
schnapper
they
did
not.
i
mean,
there
was
an
authoritative
determination
of
what
the
scope
of
the
statute
was
in
the
context
in
which
those
regulations
were
invoked.
petitioners
have
suggested
that
there
can
never
be
an
implied
cause
of
action
to
enforce
a
regulation,
or
i
would
have
to
say
here
as
well
a
rule,
because
that's
really
where
this
has
come
up,
that
contains
a
prohibition
not
contained
in
the
statute
itself.
this
court
has
done
that
on
two
occasions.
in
borak
v.
j.i.
case,
which
was
decided
shortly
before
the
announcement
of
the
adoption
of
this
statute,
the
court
recognized
an
implied
cause
of
action
to
enforce
rule,
part
of
rule
14.
and
then
in
the
superintendent
of
insurance
case
7
years
later,
the
court
did
the
same
thing
with
regard
to
rule
10(b)(5).
those
were
implied
cause
of
actions
to
enforce--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--yes,
but
the
court
has
continued
to
recognize
that
cause
of
action.
in
any
event,
those
decisions
reflected
the
standard
for
implying
causes
of
actions
that
were
prevailing
at
the
time
the
1964
civil
rights
act
was
adopted
and
it's
been
the
practice
of
this
court,
in
addressing
the
question
of
whether
it
would
imply
a
cause
of
action,
to
look
at
the
law
that
existed
when
the
statute
was
adopted,
on
the
presumption
that
congress
would
have
intended
whatever
result
would
follow
from
the
then-prevailing
law.
mr.
eric
schnapper
we
have...
we
think--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--right,
but
we
think
that
an
implied
cause
of
action
was
appropriate
under
the
'64
act
as
written.
mr.
eric
schnapper
without
resort
to
the
'86
act.
finally,
with
regard
to
the
suggestion
of
the
petitioners,
they
urge
quite
specifically
that
a
regulation
cannot
forbid
action
not
forbidden
by
the
statute
itself.
the
court
has
addressed
that
question
on
several
occasions,
in
morning
v.
family
publications
service
with
regard
to
the
truth-in-lending
law,
and
in
gemsco
v.
walling,
a
1946
decision
with
regard
to
the
minimum
wage.
both
cases
involved
prohibitions
containing
regulations
which
clearly
went
beyond
the
language
of
the
statutes.
both
cases,
they
were
upheld
by
this
court,
and
gemsco
again
was
the
prevailing
law
at
the
time
the
congress
authorized
regulations
in
602,
so
it
seems
to
me
that's
appropriate
to
look
to
here.
with
regard
to
the
argument
regarding
the
limitations
on
the
preconditions
for
certain
actions
under
section
602,
this
court
has
addressed
that
question
already
in
cannon.
it's
important
to
note
here
that
congress
clearly
intended
that
the
limitations
in
section
602
on
an
agency
action
would
apply
in
a
discriminatory
intent
case.
indeed,
the...
that
was
a
particular
focus...
intentional
commission
was
a
particular
focus
in
1964.
the
one
thing
that's
certain
is
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
permit
an
agency
to
cut
off
a
state
agency
or
a
city
agency
or
a
private
entity
from
federal
funding
without
going
through
all
the
loops
set
up
in
section
602.
that
is
to
say,
section
602
applies
even
where
we're
dealing
with
a
section
601
violation.
so
the
court
had
that
problem
before
it
in
cannon,
and
this
very
argument
was
made.
it
was
made
in
justice
white's
dissent
in
cannon.
it
was
made
in
justice
white's
opinion
in
bakke.
it
was
made
in
justice
powell's
dissent
in
guardians.
it
was
made
by
the
defendants--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--that...
i'm
sorry.
that
the
notice
and
predetermination
clause
of
section
602
would
be
evaded
if
you
allowed
a
private
cause
of
action,
because
private
parties
don't
make
those...
you
know,
can't,
or
don't
do
those
things.
that
very
argument
was
made
in
all
three
cases
and
it's
never
been
accepted
by
the
court,
indeed,
specifically
was
rejected
by
this
court.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
with
all...
am
i
answering?
mr.
eric
schnapper
with
all
respect,
there
were
three
different
issues
in
guardians,
two
of
which
were
clearly
resolved,
one
of
which
was
opaque.
the
question
of
whether
there
was
an
implied
cause
of
action
was
clearly
resolved.
there
were
six
members
of
the
court
who
ruled
that
there
was.
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
regs
was
expressly
resolved.
five
members
of
the
court
addressed
it
and
resolved
it.
what
was
unresolved
was
the
scope
of
the
remedy
in
one
of
those
cases.
that
was
the
issue.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
think
the
reasoning
with
regard
to
the
first
two
issues
i
mentioned
was
perfectly
consistent.
mr.
eric
schnapper
because
the...
because
there
were
differing
views
as
to
the...
as
to
subsidiary...
as
to
other
issues.
there
was
a
difference
about
section
601
covered
intent,
which
separated
justice
white
and
justice
marshall
from
justices
stevens,
brennan,
and
black,
so
they
had
to
write
different
opinions.
thank
you.
