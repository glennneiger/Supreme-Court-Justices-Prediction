chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
99-1908,
james
alexander
v.
martha
sandoval.
mr.
sutton.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sutton,
look
at
the
sentence,
provided,
however,
that
no
such
action
shall
be
taken
until
the
department
or
agency
concerned.
does
the
phrase
department
or
agency
there
refer
to
the
federal
department
or
agency
in
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
sutton.
mr.
schnapper,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
what
case,
mr.
schnapper?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
cannon?
i
thought
that
was
title
vii.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
title
ix?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that's
strictly
spending
clause?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
spending
clause
argument
is,
as
i
understand
it,
goes
to
the
fact
that
you're
trying
to
make
a
state
a
defendant,
so
cannon
can't
be
dispositive
of
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
you
said
to
accept
the
spending
clause
argument
meant
that
cannon
had
been
wrongly
decided.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
it
explicitly
decide
the
question,
or
did
it
just
assume
it
in
those
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
those
were
a
long
time
ago,
weren't
they,
mr.
schnapper?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
without
resort
to
the
'86?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
when
you
start
talking
about
guardians,
to
suggest
that
it
hasn't
been
accepted,
really
nothing
was
accepted,
nothing
much
was
accepted
in
guardians,
there
were
so
many
different
opinions.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
the
reasoning
of
the
various
opinions
was
not
identical.
in
the
cases
where...
in
those
cases
where
they
did...
where
there
was
a
holding,
there
was
not
any
majority-accepted
reasoning.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
why
were
there
different
opinions?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schnapper.
general
waxman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
social
context
existed
in
1964?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
referring
to
what
was...
what
various
local
jurisdictions
were
doing
at
the
time?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
none
of
those,
though,
were
against
states.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there's
no
case
suggesting
that
there
isn't,
either.
i
mean,
i
think
justice
souter's
point
was
that
this
is
an
area
where
there
is
no
precise
authority
one
way
or
the
other.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
waxman.
mr.
sutton,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
sutton.
the
case
is
submitted.
