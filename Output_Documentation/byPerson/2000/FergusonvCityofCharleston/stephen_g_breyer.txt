justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
a
doctor
today,
when
he
thinks...
he
has
a
pregnant
woman,
and
he
thinks
the
woman's
taking
drugs.
doctors
won't
look
at
the
urine
to
see
if
she's
taking
drugs?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
don't
know
if
it's
a
routine
matter
or
not.
where
i'm
having
the
problem
is,
if
you
came
in
and
told
me,
or
the
other
side
did,
that
doctors
normally
test
pregnant
women
for
drugs,
that
would
sound
okay
to
me,
and
moreover,
if
you
told
me
no,
that's
not
what
they
do,
they
normally
don't,
but
if
they
think
the
woman's
taking
drugs
and
she's
pregnant
they
do,
that
would
sound
all
right
to
me,
too.
i
mean,
after
all,
they're
supposed
to
be
looking
after
the
health
of
the
mother
and
the
baby.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah,
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
if
it's
a
criminal
sanction
that
makes
the
difference--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
is
what
i
thought
the
case
was
about,
then
i
would
like
to
know
your
response
to
justice
scalia's
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
was,
as
i
understood
it...
he's
better
at
repeating
his
question
than
i,
but
i
thought--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
won't
resist
the
chance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question,
as
i
took
it,
is,
it's
a
normal
thing,
i
believe,
in
the
medical
world,
at
least
for
psychiatric
social
workers
and
for
doctors,
they're
all
told
that
if
during
a
medical
examination
you
discover
that
the
patient
is
going
to
hurt
some
other
person
by
killing,
or...
you
know,
is
going
to
kill
the
teller,
they're
planning
a
robbery,
you
have
an
obligation
to
tell
the
police.
and
of
course,
that's
relevant,
because
the
other
side
is
saying
that's
just
what's
happening
here.
we're
learning
that
the
woman
has
put
this
viable
fetus,
a
person,
at
risk,
all
right.
these
are
children
about
to
be
born,
and
they're
at
serious
risk,
and
so
why
doesn't
this
apply.
now
that,
i
think
was...
is
that
fair,
that
that
was
roughly
the
question,
and
why
doesn't
that
apply?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
hard
for
me
is
to
figure
out
what
you
mean
by
this
leverage
point.
the...
imagine
you
have
a
community
with
a
high
incidence
of
tuberculosis.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
anything
wrong
with
doctors
saying,
you
know,
we're
just
going
to
regularly
test
our
pregnant
women
to
see
if
they
have
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there...
you
feel...
i
don't
know...
the
consent's
a
separate
issue
here,
and
i
suppose
that
doctors
normally
do
get
consent--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--for
the
test
anyway.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
all
right.
now,
suppose
that
the
same...
it's
not
tuberculosis,
but
it's
simply
drug
use.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i'm...
just
follow
my
reasoning.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
we're
doing
is
testing
the
woman.
for
tuberculosis
it's
okay,
right,
with
consent?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
same
with
drug
use.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
if
the
doctor
discovers
in
the
course
of
a
test
that
the
person's
about
to
commit
a
crime,
he
can
report
it
to
the
police,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
if
you're
that
far
down
the
road--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--then
you
give
the
test,
you
discover
the
result,
and
now
you
report
it
to
the
police,
and
you're
saying
all
that's
okay,
and
so
if
there's
something...
if
you're
saying
all
that's
okay,
what's
different
about
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
those
are
conclusions,
but
what
i
want
to
know
is,
what's
different
from...
what
happened
in
the
world
that's
different
from
what
i
just
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
give
the
test,
they
discover
there's
the
drug
use,
and
they
report
it
to
the
police.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
i'm
thinking
about
this
at
the
moment
on
this
exact
point,
that
if
you
have
an
unconsented
turning
over
of
private
medical
information
to
the
police,
there
must
be
something
special
about
the
circumstance.
now,
the
ama,
and
the
most
famous
case
in
this
area,
called
tarisoff,
both
try
to
define
that
circumstance,
and
that
circumstance,
as
the
ama,
or
as
tarisoff
defined
it,
involves
when
a
patient
threatens
to
inflict
serious
bodily
harm
to
herself
or
a
third
party
and
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
that
the
patient
will
carry
out
that
threat,
so
i
thought
that
you
either
have
to
bring
yourself
within
that
exception,
or
you
lose,
and
what
i'm
worried
about
at
the
moment
is
how
can
you
bring
yourself
within
that
exception
when
you're
faced
with
all
the
material
in
the
amicus
briefs
and
all
the
studies
that
suggest
that
this
type
of
program
does
not
help
third
parties,
namely
the
fetus.
rather,
there
is
a
question
as
to
how
much
cocaine
abuse
hurts
the
fetus,
particularly
compared
to
the
situation
where
the
mother
does
not
request
prenatal
care,
and
that
this
kind
of
program,
because
of
the
later
problem,
the
latter
problem,
probably
hurts
more
fetuses
than
it
helps.
now,
faced
with
that
kind
of
data,
and
i
see
no
data
on
the
other
side,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
bring
yourself
within
the
tarisoff
exception,
and
if
you
can't
do
that,
i
don't
see
how
you
win
the
case.
that's
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mm
hmm,
all
right.
you
come
within
tarisoff.
then
you're
arguing
that
you're
within
tarisoff.
fine.
how
do
you
get
there,
given
this
mass
of
data
that...
you
know,
that
they
refer
to
in
the
amicus
briefs,
that...
and
i've
tried
to
look
up
a
little
independently,
where
i've
come
to
is
the
conclusion...
i'm
not
a
doctor
or
an
epidemiologist,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
studies
on
cocaine
abuse
are
pretty
inconclusive
and...
as
to
how
they
affect
the
fetus,
and
even
if
they
aren't,
they're
pretty
one
sided,
the
studies,
that
this
kind
of
thing
hurts
the
fetus
because
mothers
don't
come
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
am
i
supposed--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
so
in
other
words
you
think
that
the
fourth
amendment
permits
the
police
to
go
to
a
doctor
and
to
ask
the
doctor
to
turn
unconsented...
unconsented
private
medical
information
over
to
the
police
about
a
past
crime?
in
other
words,
the
fourth
amendment
permits
doctors
to
become
agents
in
private...
you
know,
private
patient
relationships
and
suddenly
turn
over
everything
to
the
police,
even
though
no
future
risk
is
at
stake?
