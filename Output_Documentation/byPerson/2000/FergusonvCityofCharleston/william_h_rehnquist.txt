we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
99-936,
crystal
ferguson
v.
the
city
of
charleston.
ms.
smith.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ms.
smith--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
vehicle
for
the
discovery
was
a
urine
sample,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
i
suppose
you
have
to
decide
when
you
have
a
urine
sample
you
could
look
for
different
things
in
different
ways.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
they
have
made
a
special
search
for
this
kind
of
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
determine
anything
from
a
urine
sample
you
have
to
make
a
special
search,
don't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
your
complaint
is
not
that
it
was
done
for
drugs,
but
that
the
use
of
the
discovery
would
be
used
for
arrest.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
gathered
from
some
of
your
previous
answers
to
questions
that
you're
objecting
that
this
test
for
drugs
was
something
so
highly
specialized
that
itself
it
raised
a
flag,
but
it's
only
that
it
was
used
in
connection
with
a
desire
to
bring
law
enforcement
to
play
that
you
object
to
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
know,
you
take
a
urine
specimen,
and
i
think
physicians
can
look
for
any
number
of
things
in
the
urine
specimen.
each
one
requires
a
specific
procedure,
and
i
don't
think
looking
for
drugs
requires
any
different
sort
of
procedure
than
to
look
for
any
number
of
other
things
in
the
urine
sample.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
separate--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--no.
i
had
thought
that
you
could
use
a
urine
sample
and
test
for
any
number
of
things
with
that
sample.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
one
of
them
would
be
drugs.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean,
so
far
as
this
procedure
was
concerned?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
smith.
mr.
hood,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hood.
ms.
smith,
you
have
about
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
smith.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
