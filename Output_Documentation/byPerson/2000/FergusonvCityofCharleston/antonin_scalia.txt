justice
antonin
scalia
is
dss
civil
purposes?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let
me
put
another
hypothetical
to
you,
then.
many
states,
maybe
most
states
require
physicians
who
in
treating
someone,
find
some
indication
of
criminal
activity--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
can't
get
treated
for
a
gunshot
wound,
for
example,
without
having
that
being
reported,
be
reported
to
the
police.
now,
how
does
that
differ
from...
let's
assume
they're
just
doing
routine
urinalyses
of
pregnant
women
to
be
sure
that
they
don't
have
drugs
which
would
make
the
delivery
more
difficult
and
possibly
hurt
the
child,
and
they
find
drugs
in
someone.
are
they
allowed
to
report
that
to
the
police?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand.
why
does
that
make
it
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
didn't
they
do
it
to
everybody?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
but
those
criteria
would
be
the
same
criteria
that
would
determine
whether
it
was
likely
that
this
woman
was
endangering
her
health
and
the
health
of
the
child.
are
the
criteria
any
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
doesn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--are
the
criteria
any
different
from
what
would
be
reasonable
criteria
to
determine
whether
the
woman
was
at
risk
because
of
drug
use
or
was
endangering
the
fetus
because
of
drug
use?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
doesn't
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
why
doesn't
that
put
the
woman
and
the
child
at
greater
risk--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
there's
been
inadequate
prenatal
care?
i
mean,
the
drug
use
would
be
all
the
more
dangerous
for
the
woman
and
the
child.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
hospital
knows
that
it's
operating
in
an
area
where
there
is
a
lot
of
drug
use,
and
it
just
says,
as
a
matter
of
sound
policy,
we're
going
to
test
all
of
the
patients
who
come
in.
we
have
a
very
high
percentage.
we
don't
want
to
take
a
chance.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
doing
urinalyses
anyway,
we're
going
to
add
drug
use
to
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
this
is
being
done
for
medical
purposes.
that's
why
the
hospital
does
it.
we're
concerned
that
there
is
a
high
incidence
of
drug
use
in
this
community.
we
know
that.
now,
you
know,
it's
hard
to
tell
who
is
and
who
isn't,
but
to
be
sure
of
being
able
to
treat
the
woman
and
the
child
properly,
we're
going
to
give
a
urinalysis
to
everyone
who
comes
in
for
drug
use.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
police
approach
the
hospital,
or
did
the
hospital
approach
the
police
to
set
this
program
in--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
the
initiative
came
from
the
hospital.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
police
didn't
show
up
at
the
hospital
one
day
and
say,
you
know,
we'd
like
to
find
some
way
to
bust
your
patients
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
somehow
the
doctors
who
were
concerned
that
there
was
a
problem
with
drug
use
by
pregnant
women.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
there
are
no
such
children
except
before
the
protocol
was
adopted?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
of
the
pending
lawsuit
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
said
that
was
the
reason.
justice
antonin
scalia
--there's
also
no
testimony
in
the
record
that
any
other
hospital
was
approached.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
roper
hospital
refusing.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
drugs?
do
they
test
it
for
drugs?
i
mean,
you
know,
it
isn't
an
omnibus
test.
you
have
to
decide
what
you're
going
to
test
for.
do
they
all
test
for
drugs?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
don't
you
have
a
law
that
anyone
treated
for
a
gunshot
wound
by
a
physician,
the
fact
of
that
treatment
has
to
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--told
to
the
police?
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
happens
all
the
time
that
a
doctor
has
to
turn
somebody
in.
you
gave
us
a
citation
earlier
for
the
statement
of
the
district
judge
to
the
effect
that
these
protocols
were
medically
necessary.
you
said
pages
14
to
15
of
the
joint
appendix.
i
can't
find
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
1408.
you
said
page
14.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hood,
i
guess
the
finding
of
fact
you're
referring
to
is
on
page
1410,
and
i
assume
that
your
colleague
will
address
this
in
rebuttal.
the
policy,
the
protocol
was
applied
in
all
maternity
departments
at
musc.
its
goal
was
not
to
arrest
patients,
but
to
facilitate
their
treatment
and
protect
both
the
mother
and
unborn
child.
that's
a
finding
of
fact.
