justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
smith,
with
respect
to
the
first
of
your
reasons
you
point
out
that
it
is
quite
true,
in
a
sense,
that
the
law
enforcement
component
of
the
whole
scheme
was
necessary
for
success.
i
think
success
as
you're
using
it
is
success
in
getting
people
into
the
drug
treatment,
the
counseling
program
and
finishing
whatever
course
of
counseling
there
is,
and
i
understand
that.
but
isn't
there
a
special
need,
independent
of
that,
in
the
sense
that
the
treating
physicians
need
to
know...
regardless
of
whether
anyone
takes
counseling
or
not
they
simply
need
to
know
whether
there
is
drug
use
involved,
because
that
affects
the
risks
to
the
mother
and
the
risks
to
the
fetus,
and
those
are
the
things
that
they
need
to
provide
for.
so
my
question
is,
even
if
we
assumed
there
were
no
law
enforcement
component
and
there
were
no
counseling
scheme,
wouldn't
they
have
a
special
need
to
know
and,
in
fact,
didn't
they
demonstrate
that
before
the
law
enforcement
component
was
even
added
to
the
mix?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
had
no...
i'll
grant
you
that
the
treating
physicians
had
no
special
need,
i
guess,
to
get
people
into
drug
treatment
programs,
necessarily,
but
they
did
have
a
special
need
to
discover
the
facts
and,
in
fact,
to
get
the
evidence
that
ultimately
was
turned
over
to
the
police.
that
is
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
didn't
they
do
it...
maybe
i'm
wrong.
didn't
they
do
it
routinely?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're
saying
they
didn't
have
the
arrangement
with
law
enforcement
at
other
hospitals.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
not
saying
that
other
hospitals
as
a
matter
of
course
ignored
the
possibility,
if
they
had
reason
to
suspect
it,
they
ignored
the
possibility
of
drug
use
among
pregnant
women.
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
all
right,
but
it's
the
arrest
as
leverage
then.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
the
doctor...
as
i
understand
it,
if
the
doctor,
acting
without
any
prearrangement
with
the
police--
justice
david
h.
souter
--had
said,
i
think
we
have
reason
to
worry
about
drug
use
in
this
patient,
test
the
urine
to
see
if
there
is
an
indication
of
drug
use,
and
the
hospital
had
done
so,
they
had
found
such
an
indication,
i
take
it
in
your
judgment
there
would
be
no
constitutional
problem
if
they
then
called
the
police
and
said,
we
have
evidence
that
patient
x
is
using
drugs.
justice
david
h.
souter
did
you,
or
did
your
counsel
at
the
trial
level
if
it
wasn't
you,
ever
ask
for
a
finding
by
court
or
jury
that
any
of
the
criteria
used
to
determine
the
urine...
that
this
test
would
be
made
of
the
urine
samples
was
not
a
criterion
that
was
medically
appropriate?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we
don't
have
any
finding
on
it
by
court,
or
by
implication
of
the
jury
verdict,
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
that
had
there
not
been
the
formality
of
the
prearrangement,
the
agreement
with
the
police,
that
the
result
would
be
different
in
this
case.
in
other
words,
if
they
had
made
the
phone
call
and
the
police
hadn't
said,
yeah,
the
way
to
do
it
is
to
maintain
the
chain
of
custody
and
so
on,
on
your
own
reasoning
there
would
be
no
constitutional
violation
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
there's...
there--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it
is
simply
the
agreement,
in
effect--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
makes
the
difference
between
constitutionality
and
unconstitutionality.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
mean,
as
i
understand...
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg
a
minute
ago.
you
said
in
so
many
words
it's
the
police
component
of
this
scheme
that
taints
it,
and
i
understood
that
to
at
least
imply
sort
of
the
same
point
that
i
was
getting
at
with
my
question,
that
there's
no
finding
here,
there's
no
reason
for...
we
cannot
assume
here
that
the
criteria
for
taking
samples
or
for
testing
samples
were
criteria
that
were
not
medically
appropriate.
maybe
not
all
of
them
were
used
before,
but
we
have
to...
i
think
we
have
to
assume,
as
the
case
comes
to
us
and
as
you
present
your
argument,
that
the
reasons
the
hospital
used
for
determining
that
a
sample
would
be
taken
and
the
criteria
for
testing
that
sample
for
drug
presence
were
medically
appropriate
criteria.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
when
you
say
that
in
so
many
words
it's
the
police
component
of
the
scheme
that
taints
it,
what
you
mean
to
say
is
that
part
of
the
very...
the
very
determination
of
whether
to
test
or
not
was
modified
from
a
medically
appropriate
set
of
criteria
to
at
least
a
partial
law
enforcement
set
of
criteria.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
wait
a
minute.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
want
to
understand
you.
yes
or
no,
is
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
the
doctor
has
become
a
police
agent.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
the
doctor
must
be
treated
as
a
police
officer.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
did
roper
hospital
have
any
comparable
protocol
of
testing,
not
of
informing
the
department
or
the
police,
but
did
they
have
any
comparable
protocol
for
testing
pregnant
women
prior
to
the
time
they
were
approached
by
the
solicitor?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
care
whether
it's
state
owned
or
not.
the
point
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
the
medical
appropriateness,
or
the
lack
of
an
indication
of
medical
appropriateness
for
what
was
being
done
here,
and
my
question
is,
if
you
know,
or
if
it's
in
the
record,
is
there
any
indication
that
roper
hospital
was
following
some
kind
of
a
protocol
for
treating
for
drug
use
among
pregnant
patients
before
they
were
approached
by
the
solicitor?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
child
abuse
statute,
as
i
understand
it,
requires
reporting.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
does
the
child
abuse
statute
impose
a
protocol
of
medical
testing
on
doctors
who
treat
pregnant
women?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
what
is
the
indication
that
at
roper
hospital
they
were
following
a
protocol
of
testing
urine
for
drug
use
when
a
pregnant
woman
came
in?
what's
the
record
tell
us?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
expect
that
is
so,
but
the
protocol
here
went
far
beyond
a
particularized
suspicion
as
a
reason
for
doing...
running
that
urine
test,
and
i
take
it
that
the
answer,
and
i
don't
want
to
spend
a
lot
more
time
on
this,
but
i
take
the
answer
is,
the
record
does
not
tell
us
whether
roper
hospital
was
following
any
kind
of
a
comparable
protocol
of
testing
most
urine
samples
of
most
women
coming
in
for
prenatal
care,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
one
last
question.
you
indicated
that
there
were
findings
or
determinations
of
some
sort
with
respect
to
the
hospital
in
this
case
that
the
criteria
were
medically
appropriate.
where
do
we
find
those
determinations?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
did...
did
he
make
specific
findings
of
fact?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
hood,
would
you
comment
on
this
point?
with
minor
variations,
i
think
we're
pretty
much
agreed
that
if
in
the
normal
course
a
doctor
obtains
the
evidence
that
a
patient
is
about
to
commit
some
kind
of
imminent
violence
or
damage
to
another
person,
or
if
a
doctor
obtains
evidence
such
as
gunshot
evidence
which
clearly
points
to
a
crime,
that
the
doctor
is
permitted
and
obligated
to
turn
that
evidence
over
to
the
police
and
the
police
can
use
it.
start
with
that
premise.
the
argument
that
i
want
you
to
comment
on
is
this.
that
kind
of
a
rule
was
derived
in
situations
in
which
the
doctors
are
simply
going
about
their
business,
acting
independently
as
physicians.
in
this
case,
however,
the
doctors,
as
a
result
of
their
arrangements
with
the
police,
had
become
in
effect
agents
of
the
police,
and
they
were
acting
in
a
dual
capacity.
they
had
their
medical
responsibilities,
but
they
were
acting
under
an
agreement
with
the
police
to
look
for
certain
things
and
to
turn
over
information
if
they
found
it,
and
the
argument
is
that
in
that
case
the
police
should
not
be
able
to
use
the
evidence
unless
the
evidence
has
been
searched
for
and
seized
in
accordance
with
the
same
rules
that
the
police
would
have
to
follow
if
they
were
doing
it
in
the
first
place
because
otherwise,
in
effect,
the
co
option
of
the
medical
community
will
eliminate
the
fourth
amendment
whenever
the
police
can
use
the
doctors.
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
assume
that
we
found...
let's
just
assume
that
we
found,
as
a
kind
of
a
constitutional
fact
on
this
record,
that
an
agency
relationship
had
been
established.
what
is
your
response
to
the
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
what
you're
arguing
is
that
there's
no
basis
for
finding
that
kind
of
agency
here,
but
if
we
make
the
assumption
that
there
is
a
basis,
what
is
your
response
to
the
argument
that
in
that
case
the
criteria
for
police
receipt
and
use
of
evidence
has
got
to
be
the
criteria
that
would
apply
even
if
the
doctors
weren't
involved
because
otherwise
the
fourth
amendment
gets
swallowed
up
in
the
agency
relationship?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
this--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay,
and
so
your
answer...
i
mean,
i
guess
i
don't
understand
the
argument.
you're
saying
yes,
there's
a
way
to
say
that
the
dual
relationship
doesn't
affect
it,
but
is
there
a
good
reason
for
us
not
to
fear
that
this
agency
kind
of
relationship
will
swallow
up
the
fourth
amendment
standards
that
otherwise
the
police
would
have
to
satisfy?
