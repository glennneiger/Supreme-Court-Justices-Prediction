justice
john

--may
i
ask,
ms.
smith,
was
this
the
same
program
instituted
at
any
other
hospital?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
the
other
hospitals
in
the
city
of
charleston?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
they
follow
the
same
procedures?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--could
extend
the
policy
to
other
hospitals?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
there
ever
any
effort
made
to
extend
the
policy
to
other
hospitals?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
there
any
explanation
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just,
at
that
very
point,
i
thought
we
had
to
assume
for
purposes
of
analyzing
this
issue
that
there
was
no
consent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
jury
found
consent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
in
affirming
the
jury
verdict
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
the
issue
of
consent
and
said--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
in
fact
held
that
even
if
there
were
no
consent,
these
searches
were
proper
under
the
special
needs
doctrine,
is
that
not
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
don't
we
have
to
assume
for
purposes
of
analyzing
the
legal
issue
that
there
was
no
consent,
and
if
there's
an
issue
to
be...
if
we
disagreed
with
the
court
of
appeals,
in
other
words,
we'd
send
it
back
to
say
whether
there
was
evidence
supporting
the
jury
verdict.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
no,
we
could
affirm--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--on
the
ground
that
there
was
consent,
but
the
special
needs...
and
then
we
wouldn't
need
to
reach
the
issue
of
special
needs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
we
were
to
confront
the
issue
of
special
needs,
we
do
that
on
the
assumption
that
we
don't
have
to
decide
whether
there
was
consent
or
not,
which
is
tantamount
as
a
matter
of
law
to
saying
we
assume,
in
analyzing
this
issue,
that
there
was
no
consent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
only
one
of
the
city's
hospitals,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
only
one
of
the
city's
hospitals.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
it
raises
the
question,
whether
the
interest
in
using
the
threat
of
criminal
sanctions
to
deter
a
pregnant
woman
from
using
cocaine
can
justify
a
departure
from
the
fourth
amendment’s
general
prohibition
against
warantless
and
suspicionless
searches?
a
task
force
made
up
of
local
police
officials
and
members
of
the
staff
of
a
public
hospital
in
charleston,
south
carolina,
developed
a
policy
for
identifying
and
testing
pregnant
patients
suspected
of
drug
use.
those
who
tested
positive
were
either
arrested
or
threatened
with
arrest
to
induce
them
to
undergo
a
treatment
for
drug
abuse.
petitioners
are
former
obstetrical
patients
who
were
arrested
after
tested
positive
for
cocaine.
they
filed
this
suit
challenging
the
policy’s
validity
on
the
theory
that
the
drug
tests
were
unconstitutional
searches.
after
a
trial,
the
district
court
instructed
the
jury
that
the
test
were
unreasonable
unless
petitioners
had
consented
to
them.
the
jury
found
such
consent
and
petitioners
appealed
arguing
that
the
evidence
was
not
sufficient
to
support
the
jury’s
finding.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
but
it
did
not
decide
to
consent
question.
it
held
that
even
without
consent
the
searches
were
reasonable
as
a
matter
of
law,
under
this
court’s
case’s
recognizing
the
special
needs
may
in
exceptional
circumstances,
justify
a
search
policy
designed
to
serve
non-law
enforcement
ends.
we
granted
certiorari,
to
review
the
appellate
court's
holding
on
the
"special
needs"
issue.
as
the
case
comes
to
us,
we
view
the
issue
as
involving
a
public
hospital’s
right
to
conduct
tests
for
the
purpose
obtaining
evidence
of
a
patient’s
criminal
conduct,
without
the
patient’s
informed
consent.
our
“special
needs”
cases
have
involved
special
programs
such
as
the
testing
of
student
athletes
and
have
employed
a
balancing
test
weighing
the
intrusion
of
the
search
on
the
individual’s
privacy
interest
against
the
special
needs
that
support
the
program.
in
each
of
the
prior
cases,
the
special
need
was
one
divorced
from
the
state’s
general
law
enforcement
interest.
here,
however
the
central
feature
of
the
policy
was
the
use
of
law
enforcement
to
coerce
patients
in
the
substance
abuse
treatment.
while
the
ultimate
purpose
of
the
program
was
to
protect
the
health
of
pregnant
woman
and
their
unborn
children.
the
immediate
objective
of
the
searches
was
to
generate
evidence
for
law
enforcement
purposes.
given
that
purpose
and
the
extensive
involvement
of
law
enforcement
officials
at
every
stage
of
the
policy,
the
case
does
not
fit
within
the
category
of
special
needs
identified
in
our
prior
cases.
accordingly
for
reasons
stated
more
fully
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
court,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion;
the
chief
justice
and
justice
thomas
have
joined
part
two
of
justice
scalia’s
dissent.
