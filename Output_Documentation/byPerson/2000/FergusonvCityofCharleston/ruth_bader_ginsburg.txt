justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
they
had
reasons--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
have
arrests.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
had
turned
this
information
over
to
the
social
services
department--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
the
people
who
act
as
counselors
to
women
who
are
receiving
public
assistance.
would
that
have
involved
any
fourth
amendment
violation
in
your
view?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
smith,
may
i
go
back--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
smith--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
smith,
i
wish
you
would
clarify
one
point--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--because
it's
gotten
terribly
confused
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
you
said
the
only
thing
that's
wrong
with
this
program
was
that
it
was
driven...
it
was
a
means
that
the
police
were
using
to
apprehend
people
engaged
in
criminal
conduct.
you
said
in
answer
to
my
question,
i
thought,
if
a
doctor's
just
testing
for
drugs
so
they'll
know
how
to
treat
the
woman
and
the
child,
that's
okay.
if
the
doctors
took
that
test
and
gave
it
to
the
social
service
people,
that's
okay.
so
all
of
that
is
okay,
and
we
shouldn't,
i
think,
go
back
and
qualify
that
unless
you
mean
to.
i
thought
when
you
started
out
you
said
this
was
a
program
driven
by
the
police.
it
was
their
way
of
getting
people
who
had
taken
drugs.
that's
one
thing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
i
thought
you
said
that's
what
makes...
infects
this
whole
thing.
if
you
didn't
have
the
police
driving
it,
it
would
be
okay
for
medical
purposes
and
for
social
welfare
purposes.
now,
is
that
your
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
did
that
work
when
the
woman
in
question
was
no
longer
pregnant,
had
given
birth
to
the
child,
and
was
taken
from
the
hospital
just
after
birth?
you
can't
prevent
anything
when
a
child
is
born.
as
i
understand
it,
most
of
these
plaintiffs
were
women
who
did
not
come
in
for
prenatal
care,
but
were
tested
at
the
time
they
came
into
the
hospital
to
give
birth,
and
then
one
day
after
the
birth
were
removed
to
the
jail.
is
that
not
the
case,
that
most
of
these
arrests
took
place
after
a
child
was
born?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
may
have
misspoken
when
i
said
most.
were
there
women
among
these
plaintiffs
who
were
tested
at
the
time
of
childbirth
and
who
were
sent
to
jail
the
day
after
the
child
was
born?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
that
part
of
the
showing,
that
these
children
were,
in
fact,
brain
damaged?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
a
determination
that
the
child
was,
in
fact,
brain
damaged
in
any
of
these
cases?
as
i
understand
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--no
one
inspected
the
child.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
that
was
irrelevant
in
the
case,
because
you...
perhaps
i
have
the
facts
wrong,
but
i
thought
they
were
women
who
did
not
come
in
before,
who
came
in
to
give
birth,
tested
positive,
the
only
thing
that
they
signed
was
the
kind
of
consent
form
that
we
all
file
when
we
go
to
the
hospital
for
a
procedure--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
still
don't
see
how
that
works
out
when
the
woman
has
had
a
child.
i
can
see
if
you
were
making
an
argument
about
intervening
at
an
early
stage
in
pregnancy
to
help
the
woman,
but
i
don't
understand
that
argument
at
all
when
the
child
is
already
born.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
other
hospitals
where
pregnant
women
came
to
give
birth?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
solicitor
asked
the
other
hospital--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
they
did
not,
they
did
not
adopt
such
a
policy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
we
don't
know
why.
i
mean,
you
can--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
so
you're...
you're
making--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that...
but
that...
the...
far
as
the
consent
is
concerned,
it
was
an
argument
which,
as
you
said,
the
eleventh
circuit
didn't
address,
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
of
that
consent,
and
i
looked
at
the
consent
form.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
police.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
happened
to
the
people
who
didn't
come
in
for
prenatal
care,
who
came
in
at
the
time
of
labor,
and...
well,
you
tell
me...
and
tested?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
tell
me
when
they
were
given
that,
because
it
seems
it
would
be
rather
stressful
situation
in
which
to
try
to
get
informed
consent
from
someone.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
well,
you're
stepping
over
to
another
question.
the
one
i
asked
concerned
the
argument
that
the
eleventh
amendment
didn't
address
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
of
consent,
and
i
was
simply
suggesting
to
you
that
there
might
be
a
question
of
the
sufficiency
of
evidence
of
consent
in
the
case
of
women
who
never
came
to
the
hospital
for
prenatal
care,
who
came
in
while
they
were
in
labor,
and
what
they
consented
to,
what
they
signed
at
that
point,
there
might
be
reason
to
suspect
the
legitimacy,
the
informed
nature,
the
voluntary
nature
of
such
consent.
that's
all
i
meant
to
indicate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
seems
there
were
a
lot
of
doctors,
then,
violating
south
carolina
law
if
only
in
this
one
hospital
were
doctors
engaged
in
this
practice,
and
that's
a
little
odd.
they
wouldn't
need
this
protocol,
and
they
wouldn't
need
these
meetings
with
law
enforcement
people,
if
the
law
in
fact
required
when
they
test,
and
one
of
the
things
they
test
for
is
drugs,
that
they
turn
over
that
information,
but
as
far
as
this
record
shows
it's
only
this
one
hospital,
and
only
pursuant
to
the
protocol,
so
that
doesn't
fit
in
with
your
statement
that...
in
answer
to
some
questions
that
yes,
the
doctors
have
an
obligation
to
and
they
do.
is
there
anything
to
show
that
apart
from
this
one
hospital
and
pursuant
to
this
one
protocol,
that
doctors
who
find
pregnant
women
testing
positive
for
drugs
are
turning
over
that
information
to
the
police?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
say
just
that.
just...
i
want
to
be
precise
about,
said
just
what?
they
said
other
hospitals,
other
obstetrician
gynecologists
are
turning
this
information
over
to
the
police
because
that's
what
a
doctor's
obligation
is?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
asking
about
this
hospital.
i'm
asking
about
any
other
place.
this
place
has
a
protocol
that
the
police
have
given
to
this
hospital.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
which
the
police
participated.
there
were
meetings--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--did
they
say
it
to
any
other
obstetrician
gynecologist,
as
far
as
the
record
shows
it
seems
to
me
you
would
have
certainly
put
that
into
the
record
if
it
existed,
but
what
comes
to
us
is
one
hospital,
and...
with
the
nurse
who
asked
if
we
could
get...
can
we
get
the
police
involved.
there's
not
one
shred
of
any
indication
that
other
hospitals...
this
is
the
law.
the
law
requires
them
to
do
it.
