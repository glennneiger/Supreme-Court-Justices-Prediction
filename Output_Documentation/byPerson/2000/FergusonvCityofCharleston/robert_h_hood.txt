mr.
robert
h.
hood
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
issue
presented
is
whether
urine
drug
screens
for
medical
purposes
were
reasonable
under
the
special
needs
doctrine
and
as
consensual
searches.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
your
honor,
we
raised
the
issue
of
consent
at
trial.
we
proved
that
each
and
every
plaintiff
consented.
the
jury
found
they
consented.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
well,
sir,
i
don't
agree
with
that,
because
i
believe
under
the
united
states
v.
new
york
telephone
company,
decided
in
1977,
the
court
is
not
limited
to
affirm
on
an
issue
that
is
not
really--
mr.
robert
h.
hood
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
correct,
and
that's
what
the
fourth
circuit
did,
your
honor.
the
policy
purpose
was
to
prevent
pregnant
women
from
using
cocaine.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
no,
your
honor.
most
of
them
were
not
after
birth.
several
of
the
women...
four
of
them
were
before
the
policy
became
the
protocol
of
medical
university,
so
what
was
going
on
with
those
four
was,
they
were
turned
over
to
substance
abuse,
or
dss.
because
they
were
tested
positive
for
cocaine,
it
was
child
abuse.
the
protocol
went
into--
mr.
robert
h.
hood
--yes,
your
honor,
there
were.
however--
mr.
robert
h.
hood
--the
purpose
there,
your
honor,
was
child
abuse.
the
child
had
been
subjected
to
cocaine,
was
born
a
cocaine
baby
with
brain
damage
and
other
damage
from
the
cocaine.
the
department
of
social
services
took
over--
mr.
robert
h.
hood
--i
didn't
hear
the
premise.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
if
we
didn't
have
time--
mr.
robert
h.
hood
--for
the
life
of
the
policy,
to
answer
that
question,
we
didn't
do
the
follow
up
studies
with
these
individuals,
10
individuals.
but
of
these
10,
only
five
of
them
were
actually
under
the
protocol
adopted
by
the
board
of
trustees
of
medical
university
on
november
27,
1989
and
each
of
those
five
signed
a
letter,
when
they
tested
positive,
from
the
solicitor
that
said,
i
understand
that
if
i
test
positive
again,
i
will
be
arrested
and
i
will
be
prosecuted.
they
went
home.
they
came
back
a
week,
or
two,
or
three
later,
tested
positive
again,
justice
ginsburg
and
yes,
they
were
arrested.
they
were
put
in
jail,
not
only
for
the
illegal
crime
of
using
cocaine
themselves,
but
for
what
they
were
doing
to
their
child,
and
they
knew
they
were
going
to
be
arrested
in
each
instance.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
well,
your
honor,
the...
one
or
two
of
the
women
meet
that
category,
and
those
women
were
before
the
medical
university
board
adopted
this
protocol.
the
protocol
was
medical.
the
doctors
wrote
the
protocol.
there
were
nine
criteria.
the
district
court
found
that
those
criteria
were
medically
valid
and
good.
the
district
court
found
that
as
to
consent,
we
had
to
make
one
step
further
than
that
solicitor
letter.
we
had
to
show
that
each
of
those
10
plaintiffs
knew
that
they
could
be
arrested.
the
jury
found
that
they
knew
that.
that
issue
was
briefed
to
the
fourth
circuit.
the
fourth
circuit
went
and
affirmed
the
case
on
special
needs.
this
case
is
so
much
stronger
than
any
opinion
the
united
states
supreme
court
has
written
on
special
needs
for
two
reasons.
we
have
a
medical,
independent
clinical
reason
to
test
here.
we
have
child
abuse,
and
a
reporting
statute
that's
involved.
we're
not
just
stopping
someone
to
see
if
they're
drunk
or
not.
we
are
trying
to
stop
a
woman
from
doing
irreparable,
major
harm
to
her
child
in
utero.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
well--
mr.
robert
h.
hood
--yes,
your
honor.
the...
if
you
would
like,
we
can
go
through
each
one
of
these
individuals,
and
i'm
prepared
to
do
that
if
you
want
to,
but
what
i
wanted
to
say
about
special
needs
and
what
the
fourth
circuit
did
and
what
this
court's
done
with
special
needs
is,
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
a
tragic
crisis
in
society
in
1989,
a
true
medical
epidemic.
in
the
words
of
the
plaintiffs--
mr.
robert
h.
hood
--your
honor,
we
only
have
one
teaching
hospital
in
charleston.
it's
the
medical
university
of
south
carolina.
it's
owned
by
the
state.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
the
solicitor
at
the
time
approached
the
other
hospital,
large
hospital
in
our
community,
wrote
the
hospital.
this
lawsuit
came
along
and
everything
was
stopped
at
my
request.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
if
they
would
consider
adopting
their
board
of
directors,
of
trustees
would
adopt
the
policy,
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
i
can't...
there's
no
testimony
in
the
record
to
answer
your
question,
but--
mr.
robert
h.
hood
--if
i
could
be
allowed
to
testify,
i
believe
that's
the
reason.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
your
honor,
there
is
a
reference
on
page
1128
where
there's
testimony,
justice
scalia,
about
david
swacky,
the
solicitor
at
the
time,
approaching
roper
hospital.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
not
as
to
what
they
did,
just
that
they
were
considering
it.
then
the
lawsuit
came
along.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
justice
souter,
roper
hospital
is
a
charitable
hospital
owned
by
doctors,
and
there
are
no
other
state
owned
hospitals
in
charleston
where--
mr.
robert
h.
hood
--the
answer
is
yes.
every
hospital
in
south
carolina
follows
the
child
abuse
statute.
the
doctors
are
absolutely
required
to.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
there's
nothing
in
this
record--
mr.
robert
h.
hood
--but
every
hospital
tested
urine
of
every
pregnant
woman
because
they
need
to
know
what's
in
her
body
so
they
can
treat
her.
they're
going
to
give
her
anesthesia.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
if
the
doctors
suspect
the
use
of
drugs
in
any
hospital,
hopefully
in
this
country,
they
test
for
drugs--
mr.
robert
h.
hood
--so
they
can
treat
the
patient
properly.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
by
the
district
judge
himself.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
yes,
sir.
judge
c.
winston,
our
senior
district
judge
in
south
carolina,
on
page
1415
of
the
joint
appendix
states,
medical
university
adopted
these
medically
valid
criteria
to
avoid
the
very
subjective
test
about
which
the
plaintiffs
complain.
judge
houck,
at
the
conclusion
of
this
5-week
trial,
made
very...
and
it's
in
those
pages,
the
1400
numbers...
about
each
and
every
issue
that
was
raised
in
this
case.
he
took
us
one
step
further
on
consent
than
i
think
this
court
requires.
he
required
us
to
convince
the
jury
that
each
person
understood
that
their...
if
they
tested
positive,
they
would
be
arrested.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
the
consent
form
says,
i
consent
to
having...
to
the
testing
of
drugs,
and
there
are
two
consent
forms,
one
in
the
hospital,
one
in
the
clinic.
they
both
say
the
same
thing.
every
patient
signed
that.
then,
when
they
suspected
under
this
nine
medical
diagnoses,
these
differential
diagnoses,
that
the
patient
was
using
cocaine,
then
a
counselor
met
with
the
patient,
showed
her
a
video,
explained
to
her
the
consequences,
the
dire,
staggering
consequences
to
her
child
and
herself
of
using
cocaine,
basically
pled
with
her
to
stop
doing
it,
got
her
to
sign
this
solicitor
letter,
and
sent
her
to
substance
abuse,
and
if
she
went,
great,
and
that's
what
happened
to
90
percent
of
them.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
if
they
tested
positive
they
were
given
what
i
just
said,
and--
mr.
robert
h.
hood
--well,
you
have
to
put
it
in
the
context
of
what
was
going
on.
the
reason
they
were
told
is
because
it
was
mandatory.
the
hospital
board
of
directors
adopted
a
protocol
that
was
mandatory
and
nondiscretionary,
once
you
met
that
criteria,
those
medical
criteria.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
concede
there
was
not
consent.
in
fact,
i
argued--
mr.
robert
h.
hood
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
justice
o'connor,
in
my
humble
opinion
we
have
to
affirm
the
lower
court
special
needs.
we
have
consent.
we
have
dual
purpose
but
we
do
not...
state
actors--
mr.
robert
h.
hood
--you're
correct,
your
honor,
in
that
certiorari
was
granted
on
one
issue,
and
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
your
honor,
each
of
the
special
needs
cases
apply
directly,
starting
with
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
tlo
and
your
honor's
own
concurring
opinion
there,
with
justice
powell.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
we
then
jump
to
the
griffin
case
from
wisconsin,
the
sitz
case,
and
in
those
opinions
law
enforcement
was
involved,
and
in
our
case
the
role
of--
mr.
robert
h.
hood
--nor
was
it
in
our--
mr.
robert
h.
hood
--in
our
case
law
enforcement
was
not
involved
at
the
time
of
the
search.
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
search.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
that's
the
other
side's
argument.
that
was
not
the
proven
facts.
the
facts--
mr.
robert
h.
hood
--your
honor,
we
come
within
the
requirements
that
you
have
outlined.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
if
your
honor
has
a
chance
to
look
at
page
314
of
the
joint
appendix,
your
question
will
be
answered
by
the
plaintiff's
lead
expert,
dr.
ira
chasnoff,
wherein
he
said
there
was
an
urgent
need
for
the
medical
community
to
do
something.
this
was
a
major
crisis,
an
epidemic
in
the
united
states,
and
we
tried
to
down
in
charleston,
and
it
worked,
and
90
percent
of
the
people
that
had
this
awful
addiction
and
were
doing
what
they
were
doing
to
their
children
were
helped,
and
it
worked.
we
got
the
lawsuit,
and
we
stopped,
and
here
we
are.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
that's
the
other
difference
of
our
case.
it's
a
child
abuse
case,
where
the
doctor
has
to
do
it.
there
is
no
privacy.
the
doctor
is
violating
the
law
if
he
doesn't
turn
it
over.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
just
like
if
she,
if
a
pregnant
woman--
mr.
robert
h.
hood
--the
judge,
findings
of
fact
start
on
page
1408,
justice
scalia.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
i
apologize.
i
talk
funny.
1408--
[laughter]
the
order
ends
at
1417,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
justice
ginsburg,
i
believe,
and
i
can't
cite
a
page,
that
several
of
the
experts
that
we
put
on
the
stand
in
the
5-week
trial
said
just
that.
however,
you
have
to
look
at
the
patient
base
that
this
hospital,
the
state
hospital--
mr.
robert
h.
hood
--well,
it
never...
this
issue
never
came
up
at
trial,
but...
except
to
the
extent
that
this
was
a
teaching
hospital,
and
every
young
physician
in
the
ob
department
was
taught
about
that.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
not
the
police.
i
hate
to
interrupt
you,
but
the
police
did
not
do
the
protocol.
the
doctors
did
it.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
all
the
police
did
was
say,
you've
got
a
duty
and
a
responsibility
here,
and
they--
mr.
robert
h.
hood
--justice
ginsburg,
the
question
that
you're
asking
me
was
not
raised
at
trial
by
anyone,
nor
answered
by
anyone
at
trial,
but
the
answer
to
your
question
is,
we
have,
like
every
state,
a
child
abuse
statute,
and
if
a
doctor
in
any
practice
observes
child
abuse,
they
have
an
affirmative
duty
to
report
it.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
the
police
were
never
the
agent
of
the
hospital.
the
police
were
purely
a
means
or
method.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
we
strenuously
objected
it
was
established.
if
it
were
established
to
the
satisfaction
of
anyone,
and
i
don't
believe
it
was
at
trial
or
at
the
fourth
circuit,
then
the
role
of
the
police,
they
are
not
determining
who
is
tested.
they
are
not
determining
who
gets
the
test
results.
they
are
not
determining
the
counseling
of
the
patient.
they're
not
determining
whether
the
patient
makes
the
counseling
sessions.
they're
not
determining
whether
the
patient
signs
a
consent
form,
which
every
one
of
them
did.
they're
not
determining
whether
the
patient
actually
makes
the
substance
abuse
clinic--
mr.
robert
h.
hood
--that
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
apply,
that
the
court
adopt
the
case
of
attson
from
the
ninth
circuit,
wherein
it
said
the
dual
purpose
applies,
and
if
there
are
two
purposes
and
one's
medical
and
one's
not--
mr.
robert
h.
hood
--it's
okay.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
it
didn't
happen
in
this
protocol,
in
this
policy.
it
never
happened.
all
they
did
was
to
help...
these
people
helped
themselves.
every
one
of
them
ended
up
getting
off
of
cocaine,
and
it
helped.
you
know,
one
use
of
cocaine
can
kill
the
baby.
mr.
robert
h.
hood
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
that's
what
judge
houck
found.
law
enforcement
was
not
the
purpose
of
this
thing
at
all.
it
was
purely
the
tragedy
of
a
medical
crisis
of
these
pathetic
babies
coming
into
the
world
and
trying
to
stop
it,
and
trying
to
help
them
stop
it.
they
couldn't
help
themselves,
some
of
them.
thank
you.
