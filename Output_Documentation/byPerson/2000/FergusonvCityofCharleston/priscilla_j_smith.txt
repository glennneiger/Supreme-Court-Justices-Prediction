ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
case
involves
pregnant
women
who
sought
medical
care
at
a
public
hospital
and
who
then
were
searched
by
their
doctors
for
evidence
of
crimes
and
arrested,
seven
of
them
right
out
of
their
hospital
beds.
the
special
needs
exception
does
not
apply
to
this
case
to
excuse
the
lack
of
warrants
for
three
reasons.
first,
unlike
every
other
special
needs
case,
the
threat
of
law
enforcement,
the
use
of
arrest
as
leverage
was
the
key
element
of
the
policy.
it
was,
in
the
respondent's
own
words,
what
made
the
policy
effective.
second,
the
searches
were
conducted
here
in
the
context
of
the
private,
physician
patient
relationship
and
thus
there
was
no
diminished
expectation
of
privacy,
again,
unlike
the
other
special
needs
cases.
and
finally,
the
defendants
here
skirted
the
warrant
and
probable
cause
requirements
without
demonstrating
impracticability.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
if
there
were
no
law
enforcement
scheme
there
would
be
a
search
that
was
being
done,
but
it
would
be
a
search
that
was
only
done
for
medical
purposes,
your
honor,
and
therefore,
as
it
was
before
the
policy
was--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
right.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--implemented,
right,
and
therefore
it
would
have
been
consented
to,
because
there
was
consent
to
treatment
in
that
context.
but
as
soon
as
they
incorporated
a
criminal
sanction
and
made
the
policy
what
it
was,
they
had
to
comply
with
the
fourth
amendment,
and
what
the
warrant--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--in
some
cases
there
may
have
been
a
need
to
do
medical
testing.
in
some
cases--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--they
did
medical
testing
prior
to
the
policy
for
about
3
to
6
months,
your
honor.
they
had
just
started
to
do
testing--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--pursuant
to
a
listed
protocol.
as
soon
as
they
adopted
the
policy
they...
3
months
later,
approximately,
they
expanded
the
protocol
in
order
to
find
more
people
and
really
what
this
policy
was
about
was
using
arrest
as
leverage,
and
they've
admitted
that
in
their
brief.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
yes.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
mm
hmm.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
mm
hmm.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
i
don't
believe
it
would
have
been
a
violation,
your
honor,
if
they
were
testing
for
medical
purposes
and
discovered
evidence
of
drug
use
during
pregnancy.
at
that
point
they
have
some
level
of
individualized
suspicion
and
reporting
to
dss,
as
they
did,
for
every
other
substance,
for
heroin,
for
methamphetamines...
they
didn't
report
any
of
those
to
the
police.
reporting
those
to
dss
may
meet
some
kind
of
reasonable
ground
standard.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
it's
the
department
of
social
services,
to
the
civil
child
abuse
authorities.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
sitz
is--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--well,
in
fact--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--if
i
understand
your
honor
correctly,
in
sitz,
for
example,
it's
a
standardized,
nondiscretionary
policy,
and
that
i
think
is
what
saves
it.
it's
also
a
minimal
intrusion,
not
a
search
like
we
have
here,
and
there's
also
the
diminished
expectation
of
privacy
that
drivers
have,
and
that
this
court
has
discussed
in
a
number
of
cases,
including
opperman,
and
in
sitz,
whereas
in
this
case
we
have
a
discretionary
list
of
criteria
where
some
women
who
met
the
criteria
were
tested.
we
know
in--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--i
believe
on
some
levels
it
would
be.
on
the
other
hand,
this
is
not
like
sitz
for
the
other
reasons
i
mentioned.
there's
a
search,
not
a--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--but
i
don't...
i'm
sorry.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
i
don't
believe
that
there
was
individualized--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--if
there
was
true
individualized
suspicion,
and
a
search
was
done
and...
just
for
civil
purposes,
your
honor,
that
might
meet
fourth
amendment
standards.
the
lower
courts
have
held
civil
searches
to
a
lower
level
than
the
probable
cause
standard.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
the
department
of
social
services
is
the
civil
child
abuse
investigatory
agency.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
mm
hmm.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
if
there
was
a
routine
program,
as
your
honor
is
presenting
it,
without
a
targeted
list
of
criteria,
as
they
had
here,
a
discretionary
list
of
criteria,
which
is
what
makes
this
program
so
different--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--because
when
you
have
a
law
enforcement--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--no,
your
honor.
they
didn't
search
everyone.
they
looked
at
a
targeted
list
of
criteria
that
included
discretionary
elements
such
as
inadequate
prenatal
care,
and
there's
evidence
in
the
record
that
some
people
who
had
inadequate
prenatal
care
were
tested
and
some
people
who
had
inadequate
prenatal
care
weren't
tested,
precisely
because
the
word
inadequate
is
so--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--not--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--not
in...
not
to
be
tested
for
drugs,
your
honor.
if
you
mean
just
in
general
are
urine
samples
taken,
at
some
point
during
the
course
of
prenatal
care,
i
believe
they
are,
but
not--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--no.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
you
have
to
look
for
it.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
you
have
to
search
for
it,
your
honor,
which
is
what
they
did
here.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
it's
a
special
test
that
would
need
to
be
run
on
top
of
what's
normally
done
and,
in
fact--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--they
might,
your
honor.
i
understood
justice
o'connor's
question
to
be,
just
as
a
routine
matter
is
it
always
done.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
because
what
happened
here
was,
they
incorporated
a
criminal
sanction.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
the
reason
they
were
doing
the
testing--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
could
you
repeat
the
question,
your
honor?
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
that's
not
the
case
here,
your
honor,
because
this
is
not
a
case
where
they
were
treating
people
and
in
the
course
of
medical
treatment
they
came
across
evidence
of
a
bullet
or
evidence
of
drug
use.
they
searched
for
it.
they
joined
with
the
police
to
determine
what
criteria
they
were
going
to
use
to
do
the
search.
it
was
not
a--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--yes.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
absolutely.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
well,
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
the
difference
here
is
that
the
search
is
done
specifically
to
use
arrest,
to
use
the
criminal
sanction
and
incorporate
that
into
their
treatment.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
that's
right,
your
honor.
as
soon
as
they
started
to
search,
as
soon
as
they
became
essentially
the
police,
searching
for
evidence
of
a
crime,
in
order
to
use
arrest
as
leverage
they
took
on
a
new
role
and
they
had
to...
they
became
like
a
police
officer
searching
a
suspect.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
i
don't
know
if
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
well,
it
requires
a
separate
test,
your
honor.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
is
that
what
you
mean,
or--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--that's
true,
yes,
you
can
test
for--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--and
one
of
them
would
be
drugs,
but
it's
a
specific
extra
step
that's
not
done
unless
you
meet
the
criteria,
and
unless
you
want
to
use
arrest
as
leverage.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
as
far
as
this
policy
goes.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
well,
the
criteria
were
changed
after
the
policy
was
instituted.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
and
there's--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--absolutely.
they
are
not
reasonable
criteria,
your
honor--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--and
the
experts
have
testified
that
criteria
like
inadequate
prenatal
care,
lay
prenatal
care,
preterm
labor,
these
are
medical
complications
of
pregnancy--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--or
they're
more
apt
to
be
indicators
of
poverty
than
they
are
of
drug
use.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
for
drug
use?
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
it
may
have
put
her
at
greater
risk
for
other...
not
having
gotten
prenatal
care,
but
it
didn't
give
us
any
reasonable
suspicion,
reasonable
grounds,
probable
cause,
whatever
level
of
individualized
suspicion
you're
looking
for--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
no
other
hospitals--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--no,
your
honor
and,
in
fact,
that's
one
of
the
things
that
shows
the
discretion.
the
law
enforcement
officers
in
this
case
went
to
the
one
public
hospital,
joined
with
doctors
at
the
one
public
hospital
to
enforce
this
policy.
they
did
not
enforce
this
policy
at
the
private
hospitals,
and
they
did
not--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--that's
right.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
nobody
at
another
hospital--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--that's
right,
your
honor--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--but
nobody
at
another
hospital
searched
their
patients
in
order
to
use
arrest
as
leverage.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
mm
hmm.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
mm
hmm.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
and
i
think
the
reason
why,
your
honor,
is
because
there's
probable
cause
there.
there
may
be
a
lower
level
of
suspicion,
depending
on
the
circumstances,
to
report
to
a
civil
authority
like
a
department
of
social
services.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
your
honor,
the
same
reasoning--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--the
same
reasoning
would
apply
to
searches
of
people's
homes.
there's
a
high
crime
area,
we
know
there's
a
lot
of
drug
sales
that
go
on
here,
we
don't
like
the
look
of
these
houses,
they
meet
a
criteria
that--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--but
they
can't...
the
difference
here,
your
honor,
is
that
they
set
out
to
target
certain
people,
to
test
certain
people
in
order
to
use
arrest
as
leverage,
not
simply
for
medical
purposes
any
more,
and
the
criteria,
the
list
of
criteria
is
a
discretionary
list
of
criteria
that's
now
being
applied
in
the
context
of
a
police
search,
which
is
what
made
delaware
v.
prouse
an
improper
program.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
mm
hmm.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
without
their
consent?
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
if
they
were
testing
people--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--if
they
were
testing
people
for
medical
purposes
and
they
had
consent
to
medical
care,
then
there's
not
a
problem.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
right.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
it's
not...
it
is
a
problem,
your
honor,
if
the
purpose
of
the
search--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--yes,
i'm
sorry.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
if
it's
medical
treatment,
yes.
yes.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
if
it's
medical
treatment--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--and
there's
consent
to
do
that,
yes.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
at
that
point
he
has
probable
cause
or
individualized
suspicion.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
uh
huh.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
what's
different
here
is
that
the
search
was
conducted
without
probable
cause.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
what's
happened--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--what
happened
that's
different
is
that
different
people
are
tested,
because
we
have
discretionary
criteria
that
are
being
applied
in
a
law
enforcement
setting,
so
we
have--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--he
instructed
the
jury,
your
honor,
that
there
was
a
dual
purpose
to
the
test,
that
as
soon
as
there
was
also
a
law
enforcement
search,
then
the
field
changed,
the
search
changed,
and
the
fourth
amendment
applied.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
in
the
context
of
jury
instructions,
where
he
then
said
these
were
conducted
for
both
purposes,
your
honor,
yes.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
i
don't
believe
there
was
a
request
for
a
finding,
but
there
certainly
was
medical
testimony
on
that
fact,
your
honor,
from
ira
chasnoff,
from
dr.
chasnoff.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
the
jury
verdict--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--okay.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
okay.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
mm
hmm.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
that
is
my
position,
your
honor,
and
i
didn't
mean
to
change
from
that.
all
i
meant
to
do
was
clarify
why
i
thought
it
was
okay,
and
not
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
to
then
turn
it
over
once
you
have
some
evidence
and
you
can
meet
the
standards
of
the
fourth
amendment.
but
it's
a
different--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--the
original
call
that
went,
your
honor,
was
from
the
hospital
to
the
police,
but
then
it
was
a
very
preliminary
inquiry,
and
a
task
force
was
formed
consisting
of
members
of
all
the
departments,
and
the
task
force
was
actually
chaired
by
law
enforcement,
by
the
chief
of
police
and
by
the
solicitor,
and
the
policy
as
first
written
was
written
by
law
enforcement,
by
the
police.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
the
question--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--no.
the--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--the
question...
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
question
originally
came
from
the
hospital
to
the
police,
but
the
answer,
the
answer
of
how
to
cope
with
this
came
from
the
police,
and
they
wrote
the
policy,
and
they
taught
the
hospital
how
to
maintain
the
chain
of
evidence
at
the
beginning
of
the
search
for
people
who
fell
within
a
list
of
discretionary
criteria,
and
they
enforced
this
policy
at
this
one
hospital
and
not
at
any
other
hospital.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
no,
your
honor,
there
was
not.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
no,
your
honor,
there
was
not.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
i
think
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
the
purpose
of
the
warrant
requirement...
at
least
for
the
people
who
tested
positive
and
they
then
were
reported,
but
for
the
people
who
didn't
test
positive
and
who
were
searched,
we
don't
know
who
those
people
were,
there
was
certainly
a
constitutional
violation
there,
because
they
were
being
searched
for...
no,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i'm
wrong.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
because
they
weren't
being
searched
for
law
enforcement
purposes.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
you're
right.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
it's
the
agreement,
and--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--and
it's
a
list
of
discretionary
criteria
being
applied
by
police
officers.
it's
the
difference
between
delaware
v.
prouse
and
sitz.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
well,
there's
no
finding
on
that
from
the
district
court,
and
the
only
testimony
shows
that
it's
a
list
of
discretionary
criteria
that
is
not
liable
to
really
find
people
who
use
cocaine--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--i
think
the
difference
is,
your
honor,
that
the--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--yes.
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
i
think
it's
not
quite
my
argument,
because
the
issue
i
think
is
that
the
discretion
when
it's
used
by
a
doctor
for
medical
purposes...
doctors
have
discretion
and
that
may
be
appropriate
in
the
context
of
medicine,
but
once
discretion
is
used
by
police
officers
for
a
law
enforcement
purpose,
the
world
changes.

ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
thank
you,
your
honor.
three
brief
points,
your
honor.
what
distinguishes
this
policy
from
a
medical
protocol
is
that
it
was
designed
by
and
for
law
enforcement,
and
implemented
by
the
hospital
for
the
purposes
of
crime
detection.
to
say
that
the
medical
criteria
was
medically
appropriate,
as
i
said,
is
different
from
saying
that
it
establishes
probable
cause
or
individualized
suspicion,
or
allows
the
hospital
officials
therefore
to
search,
as
agents
of
the
police,
under
a
police
policy
that
incorporates
criminal
sanctions
for
evidence
of
a
crime,
and
to
turn
that
right
over
to
the
police.
and
if
it
was
probable
cause,
if
they
had
probable
cause
here,
why
not
obtain
a
warrant?
why
not
test
your
criteria
with
an
objective
magistrate
to
ensure
that
you're
not
the
discretion
that's
allowed
in
those
criteria
is
not
being
abused.
that's
the
purpose
of
the
warrant
requirement,
is
to
protect
against
that
kind
of
abusive
discretion,
and
that's
exactly
the
discretion
we
see
that
was
used
in
this
policy,
where
women
who
met
the
criteria
were
not
tested,
and
women
who
didn't
meet
the
criteria,
perhaps,
in
some
cases
were.
we
don't
know.
we
do
know
that
some
who
met
the
criteria
weren't
tested.
in
terms
of
the
finding
of
fact,
in
the
title
vi
opinion
the
court,
in
addressing
the
policy
as
a
whole,
talks
about
the
goal
of
the
policy,
the
ultimate
goal
of
the
policy,
but
when
he's
looking,
when
the
trial
judge
looked
at
the
purpose
of
the
search,
he
recognized
the
dual
nature
of
that
searched...
search,
that
there
was
a
medical
purpose
and
a
law
enforcement
purpose,
and
that's
what
brought
this
search
under
the
fourth
amendment,
and
that's
what
makes
this
policy
so
insidious.
what
happened
here
is
that
the
doctors
used
the
promise
of
confidentiality
in
the
private
physician
patient
relationship
to
obtain
information
from
their
patients
in
order
to
turn
it
over
to
the
police.
that's
all
they
did
here,
and
when
they
did
that,
when
they
took
on
the
mantle
of
the
police,
they
had
to
obtain
a
warrant
based
on
probable
cause,
and
they
had
to
do
that
for
all
the
reasons
this
court
enunciated
in
the
special
needs
doctrine,
when
it
limits
that
doctrine
so
that
discretion
will
not
invade
police
actions,
so
that
delaware
v.
prouse
is
not
okay,
sitz
is,
because
of
that
discretion.
and
that's
why,
even
if
this
court
were
to
apply
the
balancing
test
here,
we've
got
a
case
that's
got
discretionary
criteria,
we
have
a
significant
intrusion
on
the
body,
not
a
minimal
intrusion
like
we
had
in
sitz,
and
we
have
no
diminished
expectation
of
privacy.
in
fact,
we
have
a
heightened
expectation
of
privacy
in
our
doctor
patient
relationship,
and
as
the
amici
point
out
much
better
than
i
could,
that's
what's
at
stake
in
this
case.
so
we
ask
this
court--
ms.
priscilla
j.
smith
--thank
you,
your
honor.
