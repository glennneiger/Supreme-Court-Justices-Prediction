why
does
individualized
suspicion
help?
in
cases
like
sitz,
the
roadblock
case,
one
of
the
rationales
for
sustaining
it
is
that
it's
random.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
were
work
both
ways,
the
randomness
and
the
individualized
search,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
policy
of
testing
everyone
to
see
if
some
need
counseling
is
perhaps
more
sustainable
than
the
individualized
suspicion--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--argument
that
you're
making
to
us--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
it
would
be
more
sustainable
if
they
did
this
for
everybody?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
i
mean,
which
would
you
say,
the
individualized
suspicion
helps
or
hurts,
because
you
were
arguing
a
moment
ago
that
individual
suspicion
makes
this
more
suspect--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
now
you're
telling
me
that
it
would
have
been
better
without
it.
well,
i
need
to
know--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--which
is
the
more
appropriate
policy
for
a
hospital
to
use,
to
do
this
for
everybody,
or
just
with
individualized
suspicion.
which
of
the
two?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
don't
know
why
the
latter
doesn't
make
this
more
defensible
than
the
former.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
tarisoff
case,
there
had
been
no
crime
committed.
in
this
case
there
had
been
a
crime
committed.
