what
is
dss,
please?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
not
a
routine
urine
specimen
collected
for
someone
in
the
hospital
and
tests
employed?
i
mean,
that
seems
rather
routine.
is
that
not
done
for
pregnant
women
entering
a
hospital--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
connection
with
a
birth?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
and
wouldn't
that
routinely
show
up
something
like
this,
or--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--do
you
have
to
apply
special--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--analysis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
that
not
routine
in
today's
world,
where
drug
use
is
more
common,
and
the
doctor
might
need
to
know
what
to
look
for
with
the
child?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
this
with
reference
to
this
question
of
justice
breyer.
i
thought,
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
that
the
district
court
found
the
hospital
personnel
conducted
the
urine
drug
screens
for
medical
purposes,
wholly
independent
of
an
intent
to
aid
law
enforcement
efforts.
now,
has
that
been
determined
to
be
an
invalid
finding?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
was
there
a
finding
at
the...
by
the
district
court
that
it
was
conducted
for
medical
purposes,
independent
of
the
intent
to
aid
law
enforcement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
i
thought
that
we
established
that
we
take
this
on
the
assumption
there
was
no
consent.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
address
it,
and
for
purposes
of
deciding
special
needs
we
just
assume
no
consent.
isn't
that
correct?
you
already
admitted
that.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
no,
you
misunderstand
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
for
purposes
of
deciding
the
issue
on
which
we
granted
certiorari,
special
needs
exception--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--we
assume
for
purposes
of
deciding
that
there
was
no
consent,
because
consent
was
not
reviewed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
just
said
this
was
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
is
that
right?
i
thought
we
aired
this
with
justice
stevens
at
the
outset,
and
yet
we're
getting
bogged
down
in
consent,
and
i
just
want
to
know
where
we
are.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
that
for
purposes
of
deciding
the
question
on
which
we
granted
certiorari
we
simply
assume
there
was
no
consent.
it
will
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
depending
on
how
we
resolve
it,
to
determine
whether
there
was
consent.
suppose
we
say
it
was
unreasonable.
it
would
go
back,
then,
for
review
of
consent.
i
assumed
that
that
was
how
we
were
deciding
it.
i
thought
that's
what
you
reviewed
with
justice
stevens
when
you
began
your
argument.
am
i
wrong?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
okay,
and
on
that
issue
what
support
in
our
case
law
do
you
find
that
supports
a
special
needs
exception
where
law
enforcement
is
tangled
up
with
the
search?
is
there
any
case
of
ours
where
we
have
so
held?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
well,
we
reserved
the
answer
to
the
question
in
tlo,
whether
it
would
be
the
same
answer
if
law
enforcement
were
involved.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
in
the
conduct
of
the
search,
were
they--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--or
in
the
determination
to
have
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
the
procedure
was
developed
with
the
assistance
of
the
police,
in
part,
to
ascertain
whether
there
was
drug
use
so
that
people
could
be
charged.
