justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
also
the
case
that
in
order
to
build
more,
whatever
the
more
might
be,
beach
house,
residential
development,
whatnot,
there
would
have
to
be
filling
of
the
wetland;
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
what
is
the
significance
of
the
finding,
and
i
think
it
was
in
judge
israel's
opinion,
but
i
could
be
wrong
about
which
one
it
was,
that
any
such
filling
would
have
been
a
nuisance
at
common
law
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
would
in
effect
have
eliminated
the
use
of
the
wetland
for
fin
and
shellfish
breeding
and
so
on,
what's
the
significance
of
the
nuisance
finding?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i'm...
i
don't
want
to
reduce
the
case
to
something
silly,
but
i
mean
is
the
takings
claim
predicated
on
the
right
that
in
measuring
the
taking,
we
should
measure
it
on
the
assumption
that
he
was
somehow
reasonably
bound
to
be
allowed
to
build
a
beach
club
with
nothing
but
portable
sanitation,
is
that
in
effect
the
kind
of
baseline
for
the
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
now,
let's
assume
that
at
some
point
the
state
says,
well,
this
is
causing
damage,
it's
either
going
to
cause
pollution
because
of
nitrates
or
it's
going
to
interfere
with
the
fisheries
because
things
breed
in
the
shallow
waters
and
so
on,
is
it
your
position,
in
effect,
that
if
the
state
decides
to
regulate,
to
prohibit
wetland
filling,
that
it
therefore
is
engaging
in
a
taking
of
every
piece
of
wetland
that
a
landowner
might
otherwise
wish
to
fill?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
is
that
the
assumption
of
your
claim
here
that
you
used
to
have
a
right
to
fill
any
wetland,
and
regardless
of
what
the
reason
for
the
state
saying
you
no
longer
can
do
that,
that
is
a
taking.
justice
david
h.
souter
but,
with
respect,
in
other
words,
you're
saying
if
it
could
prove
the
nuisance
then
there
would
have
been
no
change
from
the
prior
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
now
let's
assume
that
it
would
never
have
been
understood
to
be
a
nuisance
at
the
prior
law
because
nobody
ever
paid
any
attention
to
that
and
they
now
say,
well,
we
don't
want
nitrates
to
go
up,
we
want
fish
to
breed
and
so
on,
and
that's
the
reason,
is
that
the
predicate
for
the
taking
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
a
different
question,
would
it
be
a
predicate
for
the
taking
claim
for
a
state
to
pass
a
statute
saying
all
dwellings,
all
public
accommodations
must
have
modern
plumbing
with
septic
systems,
would
that...
and
in
the
past
that
wasn't
necessary,
so
it
naturally
reduces
the
value
of
the
land
because
it
makes
it
more
difficult,
more
expensive
to
develop.
would
that
be
a
predicate
for
a
taking
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
i'm
getting...
no,
i'm
sorry.
all
i'm
getting
at
is,
it
sounds
suspiciously
to
me
as
though
that,
at
least,
is
what
was
involved
or
could
have
been
involved
whether
it
was
stated
or
not
when
the
state
said,
no,
we're
not
going
to
let
you
build
a
beach
club
without
any
plumbing.
and
if
the
alternative
was
pollution
by
any
plumbing
system
that
went
in
because
of
runoff
from
the
septic
system
or
a
beach
club
with
no
plumbing
at
all,
and
in
effect
modern
outhouses,
that
seems
to
me
a
weak
basis
for
a
takings
claim
and
if
that's
not
we're
concerned
with
i
want
you
to
explain
it
to
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
never
reached
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
burling,
if
rights
to
land
use
pass
from
owner
to
owner
like
that,
how
far
back
does
the
chain
go?
i
mean
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
no
logical
stopping
place
until
you
get
back
to
roger
williams
and
the
17th
century
settlement.
so
where
do
we
draw
the
line?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
doesn't
the
same
argument
apply
to
a
normal
zoning
set
back
requirement?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
a
different
question.
the
ultimate
question
of
the
taking,
it
seems
to
me
is
separate
from
the
question
of
what
background
principles
are
supposed
to
apply
to
define
how
you
calculate
the
taking,
and
i
suppose
that
if
the
background
principle
of
filling
wetland
cannot
be
tampered
with
in
effect
by
new
wetland
regulation
then
the
background
principle
of
being
able
to
build
the
property
line
cannot
be
tampered
with
by
a
setback
requirement.
i
mean,
is
that
correct,
so
far
as
calculating
the
basis
for
a
taking.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
a
reasonable
set
back
requirement?
don't
build
within
10
feet
of
the
property
line
on
a
lot
that
may
be
no
wider
than
60
feet.
that
would
be
a
reasonable
set
back
requirement,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
why
isn't
a
reasonable
coastal
zone
limitation
on
filling
acceptable?
why
does
that
have
to
be
taken
as
a
per
se
pull
back
on
preexisting
property
rights
and
as
such
the
baseline
for
a
taking?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
what
is
reasonable
then
is
going
to
be
determined
in
relation
simply
to
the
economics
of
what
came
before
and
what
came
after.
i
don't
think
you
want
to
take
that
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
would
you
look
to
the
reasons
for
the
state
regulation?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
do
you
look
to
the
reasons
for
the
state
regulation
for
anything
short
of
common
law
nuisance.
in
other
words,
is
common
law
nuisance
then
going
to
be
the
baseline?
justice
david
h.
souter
regardless
of
what
we
may
in
the
meantime
have
learned.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
i
guess
you're
going
to
have
to
come
up
with
some
other
criterion,
i
fed
you
the
word
reasonable
because
i
thought
that
probably
was
what
we
were
going
to
end
up
talking
about,
but
you're
going
to
have
to
come
up
with
some
other
criterion
for
what
passes
muster
and
what
doesn't
pass
muster.
and
you've
said
to
us
that
it's
not
a
purely
economic
calculation,
and
you've
said
to
us
that
it's
not
purely
a
matter
of
using
existing
nuisance
law
as
a
baseline.
so
if
it's
not
going
to
be
some
concept
of
reasonable
regulation
that
looks
to
the
reasons
why
the
government
did
it
and
when
it
did
it,
what
are
we
going
to
look
at
to
draw
this
line
which
i
think
you
assume
has
to
be
drawn.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
problem
here,
i
mean
we
probably
would
all
agree
that
your
first
proposition
that
you
may
not
simply
isolate
from
the
parcel,
the
one
unusable
portion,
define
that
as
a
separate
parcel,
call
it
a
100
percent
taking
and
go
home
free.
justice
david
h.
souter
at
the
other
extreme
there's
got
to
be
some
limit
to
the
parcel
that
you
use
for
defining
value
or
somebody
with,
you
know,
a
hundred
square
miles
can
have,
in
effect,
no
way
of
ever
proving
a
taking
even
though
by
most
of
our
lights
the
taking
might
be
extensive
on
some
portion.
and
our
problem
is,
how
do
you
define
parcel?
is
there
any
way
to
do
it.
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
raised
by
this
case,
but
i
mean
we're
getting
into
it,
is
there
any
way
to
do
it
other
than
by
some
reference
to
normal
commercial
usage
in
the
area.
what...
when
people,
for
example,
characteristically
define...
apply
for
subdivision
regulations...
for
subdivision
approval,
what
is
the
size
of
the
land
that
they
tend
to
group
as
one
parcel
and
apply
for
approval
for?
don't
we
have
to
look
to
some
standard
of
what
is
standard
commercial
usage
to
know
how
to
define,
how
reasonably
to
define
a
parcel?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
will
agree
with
you.
let's
say
in
your
example
that
they
say,
well,
the
appropriate
parcel
is
the
wetland
plus
one
acre.
and
the
government
says,
no,
it's
the
wetland
plus
the
remaining
10,000
acres
minus
the
wetland.
perhaps
neither
of
those
is
acceptable,
but
perhaps
we
would
look
to
the
usage
in
the
area
to
determine,
you
know,
what
are
the...
what's
the
range
of
developable
parcels
about
which
we
can
assume
the
government
was
regulating?
maybe
in
texas
it
would
be
10,000
acres,
maybe
in
manhattan
it
would
be
the
one
acre.
but
don't
we
have
to
look
to
some
criterion
of
usage
to
determine
what
is
a
reasonable
basis
for
defining
a
parcel
in
order
to
make
the
calculation?
