justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now
when
you
say
local
regulations
that's
a
zoning
authority
of
the
town.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
that
zoning
authority,
the
zoning
board?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
i
just
want
to
ask
a
few
questions
to
make
sure
that
we
take
this
case
on
the
assumption,
and
both
parties
agree
on
that
assumption,
that
the
only
development
that
would
be
allowed
is
perhaps
a
single
residence
on
the
high
ground.
so
far
as
the
'83
denial,
it
seems
to
me
that
was
the
skimpiest
kind
of
showing,
i
don't
see
any
zoning
authority
accepting
a
proposal
to
just
fill
the
marsh
without
any
further
specified
use.
i
don't
really
count
that
very
heavily
in
your
favor.
so
far
as
the
beach
club
is
concerned,
that's
a
bit
different.
do
you
read
the
opinion
by
judge
israel
and
then
the
opinion
by
judge
williams
and
the
opinion
by
the
supreme
court
of
rhode
island
as,
particularly
the
latter,
as
proceeding
on
the
assumption
that
the
one
lot
with
the
residence
on
the
high
ground
would
be
the
only
permitted
development?
can
we
take
the
case
on
that
assumption.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
it
that
beach
club
or
any
beach
club?
because
that
beach
club
was
just
about
11
acres
of
paving
with
a
port-a-john
and
a
dumpster
and
a
couple
trash
cans.
is
the
state
going
to
tell
us,
oh,
well,
we
might
have
approved
some
other
use?
are
we
going
to
hear
that
from
the
state,
do
you
think?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
know
of
any
zoning
authority
in
the
united
states
that
would
allow
a
major
filling
without
knowing
what
structure
was
going
to
be
put
on
it?
i
mean,
i
just
don't
think
we...
i
don't
think
we
need
to
get
in
that
because
i
think
the
supreme
court
of
rhode
island
did
reach
the
issues
that
you
wish
to
present
to
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
we
take
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
only
likely
permitted
use
of
the
property
in
question
is
to
build
one
residence
on
the
upland
area
leaving
the
18
or
so
wetlands
area
unimproved.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
odd
then
that
they
would
get
to
the
question
of
a
lucas
taking,
et
cetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
the
opinion
to
announce
for
the
court
in
palazzolo
versus
rhode
island,
no.
99-2047.
the
case
requires
us
to
explain
some
of
the
rules
and
principles
which
are
applicable
when
a
land
owner
claims
that
government
has
imposed
such
a
severe
restrictions
on
the
use
or
development
of
the
land
that
the
government
in
effect
has
taken
the
property
without
paying
for
it.
the
just
compensation
clause
or
the
takings
clause
of
the
constitution
is
in
the
fifth
amendment
but
it
is
applicable
to
the
states
by
reason
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
property
owner
here
is
anthony
palazzolo,
he
is
the
petitioner
in
the
court.
the
petitioner
is
a
resident
of
the
westerly,
rhode
island
where
the
property
is
located.
he
decided
to
purchase
the
property
in
his
home
town
in
1959,
it
consists
about
20
acres,
it
fronts
on
one
side
on
a
pond
called
“winnapaug
pond”
and
it
looks
on
the
other
side
over
a
street
called
atlantic
avenue
and
on
atlantic
avenue
there
is
some
the
beachfront
homes
and
then
the
beach
which
is
block
island
beyond
at
the
atlantic
ocean.
so
he
purchased
the
property
in
the
1959
through
a
corporation
and
then
in
1978
he
succeeded
in
his
individual
capacity
to
the
corporation’s
title.
in
the
meantime,
between
the
time
of
the
purchase
and
the
time
when
he
succeeded
to
title
in
1971,
the
state
of
rhode
island
enacted
legislation
by
creating
a
state
entity
called
“the
coastal
resources
management
council”
and
the
council
was
authorize
to
make
regulations
controlling
the
use
of
weapons.
almost,
all
of
the
petitioner’s
property
was
classified
as
weapons
under
the
council’s
regulation
and
that
means
there
are
severe
restrictions
on
developing
the
property.
in
1983,
the
petitioner
began
his
efforts
to
develop
the
property
and
he
submitted
two
proposals
to
the
council:
first,
he
thought
to
fill
the
entire
parcel
and
construct
the
wooden
bulkhead
along
the
shore
of
the
property.
he
did
not
say
what
he
was
going
to
do
with
the
property
he
just
wanted
to
fill
it.
the
second
proposal,
submitted
in
1985
was
to
fill
a
smaller
portion
of
the
property
to
build
what
he
called
the
private
beach
club,
and
the
details
do
not
tend
to
inspire
the
reader
with
an
idyllic
coastal
image,
for
the
proposal
was
to
fill
11
acres
of
the
property
with
gravel
to
accommodate
"50
acres
with
boat
trailers,
a
dumpster,
port-a-johns,
picnic
tables,
barbecue
pits
of
concrete,
and
other
trash
receptacles."
that
was
the
beach
club.
the
council
rejected
both
these
applications
because
the
regulations
do
not
permit
wetlands
to
be
filled
except
in
very
limited
circumstance
inapplicable
to
the
petitioner's
development
proposals.
based
on
the
rejections
of
the
proposals
to
fill
property
the
petitioner
sued
the
state
and
the
other
parties
in
the
rhode
island
state
court.
he
claimed
that
property
had
been
rendered
valueless
and
so
it
had
been
taken
without
compensation.
the
state
supreme
court
rejected
his
claims.
first,
the
court
said
the
claims
were
not
right
because
he
had
not
done
enough
to
make
the
projects
specific
and
concrete;
second,
the
court
said
he
had
not
right
to
challenge
the
regulations
because
the
regulations
were
in
effect
when
he
took
ownership
of
the
property
from
the
corporation;
third,
the
court
held
there
was
no
taking
anyway
because
they
were
still
a
portion
of
property,
so-called
uplands
portion
on
which
he
could
build
at
least
one
single
family
residence.
we
granted
certiorari
to
review
these
holdings.
in
our
opinion
today
we
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
first,
as
to
the
question
of
rightness
we
disagree
with
the
state
court.
the
rulings
of
the
council
make
it
clear
that
on
these
wetlands
there
can
be
no
fill
for
any
ordinary
land
use
and
with
outfield
it
cannot
be
improved.
more
specific
applications
for
a
permit
simply
were
not
necessary
to
establish
this
point,
so
the
case
is
right.
second,
we
disagree
with
the
state
supreme
court's
determinations
that
since
the
petitioner
acquired
ownership
of
the
property
in
1978,
he
cannot
challenge
regulations
promulgated
under
the
1971
rhode
island
legislations.
we
cannot
accept
the
rational
that
the
purchaser
or
successive
title
owner
like
the
petitioner
is
deemed
to
have
notice
of
a
preexisting
regulation
and
so
as
barred
from
bringing
and
takings
claim.
where
we
to
accept
this
sweeping
rule,
the
post-enactment
transfer
of
title
would
absolve
the
state
of
its
obligation
to
defend
any
action
restricting
land
use,
no
matter
how
extreme
or
unreasonable.
a
state
would
be
allowed,
in
effect,
to
put
an
expiration
date
on
the
takings
clause.
this
ought
not
to
be
rule.
future
generations,
too,
have
a
right
to
challenge
unreasonable
limitations
on
the
use
and
value
of
land.
now,
given
our
determination
that
the
petitioner
can
assert
a
takings
claim,
we
must
reach
near
to
that
claim.
now,
here
there
are
two
lines
of
cases,
two
principle
authorities
to
be
considered:
first,
the
petitioner
asserts
the
taking
under
the
rationale
of
our
decision
in
lucas
v.
south
carolina
coastal
council.
in
lucas
this
court
indicated
that
if
a
regulation
denies
all
economically
beneficial
use
of
the
land
then
compensation
is
required.
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
held
the
petitioner
do
not
suffer
a
total
taking
because
an
upland
portion
of
the
property
can
still
be
improved
by
building
the
residence.
we
agree
with
that
holding
and
so
we
affirm
this
ruling
of
the
state
supreme
court.
we
do
hold
however
that
on
remand,
the
state
supreme
court
must
address
the
second
takings
theory
the
owner
asserted.
this
is
the
claim
that
there
has
been
taking
under
the
reasoning
of
this
court
in
a
case
called
penn
central
v.
new
york
city.
the
penn
central
case
requires
the
state
court
to
consider
the
regulation's
economic
effect
on
the
landowner,
the
extent
to
which
the
regulation
interferes
with
reasonable
investment-backed
expectations,
and
the
character
of
the
government
action
and
other
matters,
and
this
issue
must
be
addressed
on
remand.
justice
o’connor
and
justice
scalia

filed
concurring
opinions;
justice
stevens
has
