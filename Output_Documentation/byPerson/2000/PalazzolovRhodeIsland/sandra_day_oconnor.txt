may
i
ask
the
extent
to
which
it
affects
the
reasonable
investment
expectations
of
someone
who
buys
property
with
regulations
already
in
existence,
so
that
when
you
buy
the
property
you
know
to
develop
this
it's
going
to
be
a
tough
uphill
battle,
because
i
know
what's
on
the
books
and
i
know
how
they've
treated
them.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
we
know
what
size
of
the
property
to
look
at
in
looking
at
this
takings
claim?
can
we
look
just
at
the
wetlands
which
is
what
his
application
dealt
with?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
didn't
sound
like
it
today.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
think
of
this,
there
is
a
poor
little
widow
woman
who
owns
it
and
she
can't
possibly
develop
it
or
deal
with
it
and
she
puts
it
on
the
market.
and
somebody
comes
along
and
knows
the
regulation
is
there
but
says,
look,
that
regulation
is
going
to
have
to
be
applied
in
a
reasonable
manner,
i'm
going
to
pay
you
x
amount
for
this
property
and
then
challenge
it.
i
mean
what's
the
matter
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
buyer
takes
it
expecting
to
have
to
make
a
penn
central
type
takings
challenge.
