justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
that
the
record
showed
that
the
rhode
island
courts
concluded
that
mr.
palazzolo
could
have
built
quote,
at
least
one
house
on
the
upland
portion
of
the
property,
the
crmc
director
testified
he
might
have
built
as
many
as
four,
and
that
the
residual
property
would
have
had
a
value
of
about
157,000
dollars
if
given
as
open
land.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
wouldn't
let
you
build
the
house
or
not?
i
thought...
was
there
testimony
at
trial
that
you
could
have
built
up
to
four
houses,
the
crmc
director
said,
i
don't
have
the
exact
words,
but
i
take
it
he
might
be
able
to
build
as
many
as
four.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
there's
a
finding
by
them
that
you
couldn't
build
four?
in
other
words...
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is,
you're
saying
that
the
value
of
the
property
was
reduced
to
near
zero.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
some...
or
that
what
you
think
is
equivalent
to
lucas
zero,
because
it
might
have
been
worth
3
million.
we'll
have
a
record
here
in
findings
and
all
kinds
of
argument
about
what
the
value
of
the
house
would
have
been,
the
value
of
the
place
would
have
been,
how
do
we
know?
what--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
didn't
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
want
the
answer
to
that,
that's
why
i
read
the
part
that
justice
scalia
cited
earlier.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
do
say
a
portion
of
the
site
would
have
been
approved
as
a
single
home
site.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
is
true.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
don't
say
whether
other
things
might
also
have
been
approved.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
he's
right
though
in
saying
that,
in
reading
it,
one
might
have
thought
that
what
we're
talking
about
is
it's
been
established
that
this
could
be
used
just
for
a
single
home
and
that's
it.
and
now
the
argument
comes
back
when
it's
fully
argued,
well,
it
maybe
could
have
been
up
to
four
homes,
maybe
they
could
have
done
other
things,
he
never
applied,
et
cetera.
what
are
we
supposed
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
you
address--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
curious
on
a
different
issue
which,
if
we
get
to
it,
i'm
having
trouble
with.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
is
does
a
takings
claim
run
with
the
land?
and
i'd
like
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
about
that.
what
i
found
difficult
is
both
sets
of
briefs
had
pretty
good
arguments
and
i
can
see
the
horribles
that
seem
to
occur
either
way.
the
gas
station
with
the
land
dumped
on
it,
on
the
one
hand,
or
the
people
going
out
and
buying
old
claims
at
the
other.
and
so
i
wondered,
on
your
opinion,
would
it
work
to
say
it
does
run
with
the
land
but
no
one
can
recover
more
than
his
investment
back
expectation,
that
is
to
say
if
somebody
goes
and
buys
cheap,
land
with
an
already
existing
taking
claims,
they
will
not
benefit
from
that
because
they
could
not
recover
more
in
fairness
than
what
they
paid
for
the
land
minus
the
value
of
the
land
for
all
other
purposes.
now,
i
want
to
see
if
that's
a,
i
mean
there's
some
suggestion
of
that,
but
i
want
to
know
how
to
decide
that
issue
just
in
case
we
get
to
it.
and
it
is
a
very
hard
issue,
in
my
opinion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
period.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
what
do
you
do
with
the
gas
station
where
some
old
map
is
around
and
because
the
person
didn't
check
the
title
perfectly
or
didn't
know
what
to
do,
lo
and
behold
he
wakes
up
and
he
discovers
400
cubic
yards
of
dirt
thrown
all
over
his
property
making
it
unusable
and
they
say
oh,
three
generations
back
there
was
a
map
filed
somewhere
that
said
maybe
the
city
would
have
ability
to
do
that.
you
know
what
i'm
talking
about,
that
seemed
a
very
appealing
hypothetical.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
going
to
do
that
completely
100
percent,
what
do
you
do
about
the
gas
station?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know,
in
the
briefs
they
have...
i
don't
want
to
go
into
it,
it's
too
long.
but
the
person
sold
his
gas
station,
years
ago,
and
at
that
time
there
was
a
map
somewhere
in
city
council,
and
it
showed
that
the
highway
that
went
by
was
subject
to
some
kind
of
support,
and
years
later
the
third
owner
finds
one
day
his
gas
station
is
under
dirt
because
they
said
it's
time
to
have
the
support.
and
he
wanted
to
claim
that...
if
you're
not
familiar
with
it...
take
my
word
there
could
be
very
unfair
things
that
happen
as
a
result
of
an
absolute
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
what
you
replied
to
justice
kennedy
by
saying
that
the
claim,
a
valid
right
takings
claim,
or
a
valid
takings
claim
does
not
run
with
the
land,
no
matter
what.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
goes
into
that
ordinarily?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
he
would
pay
200,000
dollars?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
we
were
agreeing
that
the
value
of
the
18--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
value
is
200,000.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
i'm
trying
to
figure
out,
lucas
versus
penn
central.
why
isn't
that
enough?
take
everything
in
your
favor,
you
admit
the
property
is
worth
200,000,
and
then
there's
some
testimony
here
that
if,
if,
if,
if,
if,
if,
if,
it
might
have
been
sold
for
3
million,
okay,
it
still
has
200,000
left,
why
isn't
that
good
enough?
go
to
penn
central
if
you
want
some
recovery.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
absolutely
right.
my
question
is
why
isn't
200,000
dollars
enough
to
take
it
out
of
the
total
takings
case,
reduce
value
to
zero,
namely
lucas,
and
to
throw
it
in
the
box,
legal
box
marked
penn
central.
