mr.

you've
had
a
number
of
questions,
i'm
going
to
extend
your

by
five
minutes,
i'll
extend

general
whitehouse.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
supreme
court
of
rhode
island
did
not
rely
on
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
both
sides
of
atlantic
avenue
or
just
on
the
seaward
side?

pondward.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
cases
like
williamson
county
and
some
of
the
other
leave
the
states
completely
free
to
exact
whatever
they
want
in
what
you
might
call
procedural
requirements
for
zoning.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
you
have
answered
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--then
you're
saying
in
my
hypothesis
of
an
entire
section
of
land,
a
developer
fences
off
10
acres,
that
when
he's
turned
down
for
10
acres
saying
no
use
at
all,
that
not
only
is
there
no,
but
it's
not
even
ripe.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
whitehouse.
mr.
stewart,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he's
relying
on
the
just
compensation
clause
and
armstrong
isn't
the
only
case
construing
the
just
compensation
clause.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
stewart,
supposing
i
bought
an
acre
of
land
out
in
tysons
corner
for
15,000
dollars
in
1959.
now
it's
appraised
at
a
million
dollars
and
the
government
comes
on
and
says,
well,
look,
you
only
paid
15,000
for
that,
we
ought
to
take
that
into
consideration
deciding
whether
it's
been...
what's
been
taken.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
burling,
you
have
seven
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
thank
you,
mr.
burling.
the
case
is
submitted.
