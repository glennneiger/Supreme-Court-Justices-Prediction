mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
open
by
addressing
two
questions
that
justice
souter
raised.
the
first
is
a
rather
technical
one
having
to
do
with
the
effect
on
the
pond
of
the
nuisance
and
the
cause.
and
i
would
refer
you,
your
honor,
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
page
appendix
b10
in
which
the
rhode
island
superior
court
found
that
the
12
percent
loss
of
the
total
salt
marsh
filtering
in
the
winnapaug
pond
will
have
a
significant
detrimental
impact
on
the
existing
salt
marsh
and
went
on
from
there
to
reach
the
nuisance
conclusion.
it
did
not
have
to
do
with
the
isds
system
and
that
was
based
on
testimony
that
was
in
the
record
about
the
fact
that
there
are
nitrates
and
things
that
wash
into
this
pond
and
the
wetland
itself
is
the
mechanism
that
filters
those
nitrates
out.
and
so
simply
the
removal
and
filling
of
those
wetlands
per
se
was
the
basis--
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
--they
didn't
speak
to
it
one
way
or
the
other,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
i
do
not
believe
justice
kennedy
that
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
decisions
of
either
the
rhode
island
superior
court,
or
the
rhode
island
supreme
court,
which
both
indicated
that
there
were
additional
economically
viable
uses
available
and
they
did
not
refer
to
those
as
the
building
of
a
house.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
well,
there
are
three
categories
of
information
here.
there
is
the
established,
and
what
we
referenced
your
honor
in
our
memorandum
in
opposition,
there
was
the
established,
and
established
in
the
superior
court,
proposition
that
at
least
one
house
worth
at
least
200,000
dollars
can
be
built.
then
there
is
the
uncertainty
as
to
what
additional
upland
there
is
and
how
many
other
houses
can
be
built.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
no,
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
well--
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
--sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
yes.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
correct.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
which
is
true.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
correct,
because
that's
the
uncertainty
area.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
it
has
been
established
that
it
can
be
used
as
at
least
one
single
family
home,
and
that
was
what
i
intended
to
refer
to.
and
it
has
not
been
established,
because
of
the
unripeness
problems
in
this
case,
what
further
development
might
be
permissible.
and
to
get
back
to
the
question
about
lucas,
that's
significant,
because
the
court
addressed
the
valuelessness
issue
and
found
that
there
was
substantial
value
there.
and
if
lucas
is
seen
as
a
pure
valuelessness
case
then
that
would
appear
to
settle
the
question.
but
there's
also
discussion
in
lucas
about
what
justice
scalia
called
the
deprivation
fraction,
and
that
would
appear
to
require
a
more
complex
analysis
than
was
required
in
lucas
where
you
had
the
finding
of
valuelessness
from
the
court
below
as
opposed
to
the
finding
from
the
courts
below
here
of
value.
and
where
that
founders--
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
--yes,
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
well,
the
most
recent...
i
would
go
back
to,
for
instance,
at
the
earliest
expression
the
penn
central
case,
which
used
the
term
parcel
as
a
whole
and
from
which
the
parcel
as
a
whole
discussion
has
emerged
and
then
most
recently
in
justice
scalia's
concurring
opinion
in
the
suitum
decision,
you
referred
to
the
relevant
property
as
the
aggregation
of
all
the
owners
property
subject
to
the
regulation
at
least
those
that
are
contiguous.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
i
believe--
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
--we
always
face
in
these
takings
cases,
the
problem
of
whether
it
is
the
regulation
itself
that
has
effected
the
taking
or
whether
property
interests
have
been
arranged
in
such
a
way
as
to
create
a
valuelessness
portion.
and
i
think
without
knowing
more
about
the
facts
behind
an
example
like
that,
it
could
fall
into
either
category.
and
i
think
that's
why
it's
an
important
distinction.
i'd
like
to
focus
a
moment
on
the
ripeness
issues
that
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
raised.
and
the
first
has
to
do,
they
found
obviously
that
this
case
was
unripe
on
two
grounds,
and
the
first
ground
was
that
there
had
been
no
application
for
the
74-unit
subdivision.
and
that
to
us
makes
perfect
sense
because
in
the
rhode
island
courts,
unlike
in
this
court,
the
petitioner
presented
that
74-unit
subdivision
as
a
proposal
and
not
as
a
claim
of
value
for
determining
the
size
of
the
taking.
and
so
that
is
very
likely
responsive
to
the
argument
made
to
that
court
that
this
was
a
proposal,
and
even
if
it
was
not
responsive
to
that,
i
would
argue,
even
if
they
were
asserting
a
proposition
of
rhode
island
ripeness
law
that
we
want
in
rhode
island
to
have
people
when
they
come
and
apply
for
a
use
or
come
and
make
a
takings
claim
for
a
particular
use
to
have
applied
for
that
same
use
at
some
point.
and
in
this
case--
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
--the
critical
word,
your
honor,
in
your
question
was
this,
and
the
question
if
this
is
the
wetland
then
you're
correct.
but
if
this
is
his
property,
then
you
have
to
look
because
ripe...
the
takings
determination
looks
at
value,
you
have
to
look
at
what
remaining
value
there
is.
somebody
can
insist
on
applying
for
apartment
buildings,
amusement
parks,
everything
in
the
world
in
a
residential
development
and
be
told
no,
over
and
over
and
over
again.
and
there
can
still
be
value
in
that
property,
it's
just
never
been
applied
for.
and
that's
the
case
here.
there
is
value
in
this
property.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
the
part
that's
not
wetland,
absolutely
and
the
part
that
is--
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
--yes.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
let
me
start
at
the
ocean.
you
start
at
the
atlantic
ocean
and
you
come
up
the
beach,
and
at
the
top
of
the
beach
is
atlantic
avenue.
on
the
other
side
of
atlantic
avenue,
the
predecessor
parcel
to
this
parcel
began,
and
the
prior
owner
edgemere
realty,
who
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case,
sold
off
all
the
lots
along
atlantic
avenue,
which
would
be
consistent
with
the
pattern
of
development
that
the
aerial
photographs
show.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
they
only
owned
on
the
pondward
side--
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
--and
they
sold
off
that
first
layer
of
development
that
is
consistent
with
the
development
pattern
up
and
down
that
area.
then
comes
sgi,
and
it
owns
the
land
behind
that
on
the
pondward
side,
and
they
make
11
sales,
five
of
which
come
back,
six
net
sales,
four
of
those
sales
now
have
houses
standing
on
them.
at
that
point,
sgi
fails
to
file
its
proper
papers
with
the
secretary
of
state's
office,
the
property
transfers
by
operation
of
law
to
mr.
palazzolo
and
now
he
applies
only
to
fill
the
remaining
wetlands
in
what
is
really
a
third
generation
remainder
of
a
parcel.
and
there
is
no
evidence
coming
out
of
the
administrative
proceedings
because
of
the
way
in
which
the
filing
was
made
about
where
the
value
is.
all
of
the
value
testimony
in
this
case
comes
out
of
the
case
in
the
superior
court.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
examples
like
what
the
court
saw
in
del
monte
dunes
suggest
that
there
can
be
overbearing
by
state
regulators.
and
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
sort
of
general
rule
about
prior
regulation
being
a
bar,
i
think
that
there
are
some
of
these
cases,
neither
in
del
monte
dunes
nor
in
macdonald
that
this
court
inquire
as
to
the
order
in
which
the
acquisition
and
the
regulation
occurred.
in
every
other
case,
you
have
a
prior
regulation
and
a
subsequent
acquisition.
and
i
think
the
reason
is
because
they
were
looking
at
what
the
agency
was
actually
doing.
were
they
obstructing?
were
they
being
a
nuisance?
was
there
futility?
and
there,
i
think
it's
a
separate
question.
does
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
that
may
be,
if
you
have
a
situation
in
which
the
entire
parcel
is
put
before
that
agency,
so
that
it
can
make
a
sensible
decision.
in
a
nutshell,
your
honor,
the
ripeness
problem
in
this
case
isn't
an
exhaustion
of
remedies
type
ripeness
problem,
we
do
not
assert
that
mr.
palazzolo
has
left
something
undone
procedurally
in
this
case.
we
assert
that
he
only
put
his
most
heavily
burdened
property
into
the
administrative
process
and
there
was
and
could
be
no
inquiry
as
to
what
value
there
was.
and
that
to
us
seems
a
recipe
for
the
prospect
of
manufacturing
takings,
if
you
can
isolate
the
portion
of
your
property
that
is
not
valuable
or
that
is
not
buildable
and
apply
only
as
to
that
and
not
show
the
regulators
or
discuss
with
the
regulators
property
that
you
can
perfectly
well
build
on,
you
put
them
in
an
impossible
situation.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
but
in
this
case
the
record
below
and
the
findings
of
the
courts
is
that
there
is
valuable
use
there
and
perhaps
a
good
deal
of
valuable
use.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
i
would
argue
that
he
would
almost
certainly
never
be
permitted
to
fill
it
for
residential
subdivision
purposes.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
it
would
be
very,
very
hard.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
it
would
be
very,
very
hard.
there
is
testimony,
your
honor,
that
it's
worth
7,000
dollars
an
acre
as
an
amenity
value
to
the
existing
uplands.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
well,
i
think...
i'm
trying
to
make
a
narrower
point,
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
which
is
that
for
ripeness
purposes,
which
is
what
i
was
intending
to
be
talking
about,
the
parcel
that
is
brought
forward
to
the
regulators
should
be
the
whole
parcel
so
that
they
can
make
an
assessment
of
what
the
value
is,
and
when
you
can't,
you
leave
the
numerator
and
the
denominator
uncertain.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
if
the
test
of
a
taking
is
the
value
that
is
left
in
the
property
after
the
application
of
the
challenged
regulation,
then
you
have
to
know
that
value.
it
is
ipso
facto
always
going
to
be
100
percent
as
to
the
burden
part
of
the
parcel.
and
that's
precisely
our
point
here.
there's
a
whole
parcel
violation
that
underlies
the
ripeness
problem.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
correct.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
and
we
know
that
it
isn't
in
this
case.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
well,
ripeness
is
a
somewhat
discretionary
doctrine,
and
there
may
be
facts
in
which
it
can
become
ripe,
as
this
court
did
in
lucas,
can
find
and
ripen
a
case
in
which
there
hasn't
been
a
formal
application
made
for
the
use.
but
in
this
case
the
rhode
island
court
was
presented
with
a
very
difficult
situation,
it
was
presented
with
a
case
in
which
the
record
contained
nothing
about
the
value
of
the
property.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
from
the
administrative
record.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
but
that
wasn't
determinable
from
the
administrative
record.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
from
the
trial
record.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
correct.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
let
me
first...
i'm
not
sure
that
i
would
agree
with
your
premise,
first.
if
somebody
owns
a
10,000-acre
ranch
and
they're
forbidden
from
building
in
a
wetland
on
the
corner
of
that
ranch
and
they
isolate
that
wetland
through
a
variety
of
corporate
devices
and
then
claim
that
they've
had
a
taking,
i
would
say
that
first
that
is
not
a
taking
because
the
entity's
interests
should
be
looked
at
entirely,
certainly
as
justice--
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
--i
think
that
the
argument
could
become
so
extravagant
that
you
got
to
the
point
of
having
to
define
those
parcels.
but
i
think
the
ordinary
definition
will
come
from
the
chain
of
title
of
the
property.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
that's
what
you
got.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
and
in
the
long
run,
i
mean,
this
case
presents
an
interesting
situation,
if
all
of
the
upland
ends
up
getting
sold
off
by
mr.
palazzolo,
and
now
he's
left
with
nothing
but
his
wetlands,
now
we
do
face
that
question
very
directly
because
there
isn't
the
unripeness
of
the
value
determination,
we're
there.
and
i
think
in
that
circumstance
because
of
what
the
takings
clause
is
about,
you
have
to
be
able
to
look
to
the
history
of
that
parcel.
we
can't
have
a
situation
in
which
you
can
whittle
your
way
down
to
the
only
thing
you
can't
build
on
and
then
claim
it
as
a
taking.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
i
didn't
mean.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
i
guess
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
a
particular
parcel,
once
defined
within
a
single
owner,
if
there's
a
heavily
burdened
portion
of
that
parcel
and
then
over
time
it
gets
whittled
down
to...
you
should
be
able
to
look
back
to
some
point
in
time,
arguably
the
owner,
at
the
time
that
the
challenged
regulation
went
into
effect
and
define
the
parcel
thusly--
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
--yes.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
my
argument
would
be
that
it
does
not
run
with
the
land.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
period.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
yeah,
yeah.
my
argument
is
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
timing
of
the
acquisition,
you
have
to
look
at
who
owned
it,
you
have
to
look
at
the
state
law
of
whether
things
are
transferable
in
that
kind
of
transfer
or
not.
i'm
not
saying
you
can
never
go
back
and
in
house
we've
been
talking
about
what,
you
know,
what
would
have
happened
if
mrs.
suitum
had
died
at
the
last
minute.
would
her
estate
not
arguably...
it
would
be
fair
to
have
a
claim
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
and
i
think
the
best
way
to
argue
that
is
under
penn
central.
and
this
was
a
lucas
case
and
that's
why
the
court
didn't
quite
get
to
it.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
really,
you
honor,
since
time
immemorial.
i
have
to
disagree
with
my
brother's
assertion
that
there
was
a
right
to
fill
in
rhode
island.
mr.
sheldon
whitehouse
never
was
one.
never
has
been.
and
the
cases
that
he
searched
for
the
alternative
proposition,
yates
versus
milwaukee
and
the
series
of
rhode
island
decisions
are
all
cases
that
involve
a
harbor
line.
and
the
way
this
law
works
as
the
court
knows,
is
that
you
have
no
right
to
fill
out,
it's
the
state's
property,
and
it's
subject
to
the
state's
control
and
regulation.
and
one
way
the
state
lets
you
know
that
you
can
and
gives
its
assent
is
by
establishing
a
harbor
line.
and
when
it
establishes
that
harbor
line
then
you
can
build
out
to
it.
but
always,
always,
always...
there's
one
other
point,
which
is
that
you
do
have
a
common
law
right
to
wharf
out
or
build
out
into
the
wetlands
as
against
your
neighbor,
as
against
the
rest
of
the
world.
but
you
don't
as
against
the
state
because
the
state
from
the
very
first
day
in
rhode
island
has
owned
all
of
its
wetlands
in
fee.
and
still
does
to
this
day.
the
public
trust
doctrine
is
alive
and
well
in
