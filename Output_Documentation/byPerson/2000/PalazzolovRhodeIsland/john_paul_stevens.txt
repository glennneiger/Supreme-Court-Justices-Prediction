let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
the
geography,
i've
been
looking
at
tab
six.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
uplands...
is
the
wetlands
between
the
uplands
and
the
ocean?
in
other
words
would
a
person
with
a
house
in
the
uplands
have
the
same
view
of
the
ocean
if
something
were
built
in
the
wetlands?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
at
some
point
the
state
or
the
governmental
agency
has
the
obligation
to
come
forward
and
say
what
it
will
allow?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
when,
in
your...
your
opponent
says
the
taking
occurred
in
1986.
when,
in
your
opinion,
did
the
state
prevent
the
wetlands
from
being
filled?
when
did
the
legal
obstacle
to
filling
arrive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
do
you
think
that
ended
or
do
you
think
there
never
was
one?
