mr.
james
s.
burling
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
according
to
local
land
use
regulations
there
are
two
uses
to
which
mr.
palazzolo's
property
can
be
put,
residential
and
a
beach
club.
in
1983
mr.
palazzolo
applied
to
fill
all
18
acres
of
his
property
which
would
have
made
the
property
suitable
for
either
use.
when
that
was
denied,
he
applied
for
a
lesser
scaled-back
permit
application
to
fill
11
and
a
half
acres
for
a
beach
club.
mr.
james
s.
burling
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
s.
burling
that
is
the
town
of
westerly's
zoning
authority,
your
honor.
mr.
james
s.
burling
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
know
from
the
reasons
given
by
the
coastal
resource
management
council,
crmc,
for
its
denial
of
the
1985
application,
that
it
found
that
a
beach
club
would
not
serve
the
compelling
public
interest
standard
that
the
crmc
has
for
approving
applications.
mr.
james
s.
burling
i
do
not
believe
they
will,
your
honor,
because
they
have
never
made
that
allegation
or
statement
previously
in
this
case
with
regard
to
any
kind
of
beach
club
use
being
allowed.
now,
this
beach
club,
which
by
the
way
was
unpaved
and
did
have
very
minimal
structures,
mr.
palazzolo
believed
that
that
would
have
less
of
an
environmental
impact
than
having
structures
with
sanitation
facilities
and
things
of
that
nature.
we
know
quite
clearly
what
uses
he
could
and
could
not
do
with
the
property.
at
trial,
for
example,
it
was
brought
out
that
no
residential
structures
of
any
kind
would
meet
the
public
purpose
requirement
of
crmc.
mr.
james
s.
burling
your
honor,
if
i
may
try
to
clarify
the
record
a
bit
on
that,
we
do
readily
admit
that
the
state
has
said
that
it
would
gladly
allow
mr.
palazzolo
to
apply
for
one
homesite
on
the
small
upland
area
on
the
property,
a
40
by
90-foot...
40
by
80-foot
turn
around,
50
by
80-foot
turn
around,
excuse
me,
at
the
end
of
the
1500-foot
roadway.
that
would
be
allowed.
there
was
some
initial
testimony
at
trial
regarding
other
wetland
uses,
excuse
me,
other
upland
uses
perhaps,
but
later
on
at
trial
that
became
clear
that
any
other
upland
on
this
property
could
only
be
reached
by
filling
wetland
to
access
it.
and
at
trial
the
crmc
executive
director
made
it
quite
clear
that
there
were
no
residential
structures
could
meet
the
compelling
public
purpose.
i
think
we're
going
in
this
case--
mr.
james
s.
burling
--and
later
on
in
testimony
by
crmc's
biologist
show
that
to
reach
any
other
upland
on
the
property
wetlands
would
have
to
be
filled,
and
that
would
not
be
in
the
public
interest.
it
would
not
meet
the
compelling
public
interest
there.
mr.
james
s.
burling
to
200,000.
mr.
james
s.
burling
i
think,
your
honor,
the
best
way
of
telling
is
looking
at
the
state's
opposition
to
the
petition
for
cert
where
they
say
in
there
that
they
would
gladly
allow
mr.
palazzolo
to
build
a
single
family
home--
mr.
james
s.
burling
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
s.
burling
your
honor,
i
couldn't
agree
with
you
more.
mr.
james
s.
burling
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
s.
burling
judge
williams'
decision
is
the
one
that
talked
about
nuisance.
mr.
james
s.
burling
yes,
your
honor.
and
he
was
referring
to
the
consequences
from
the
18-acre
fill,
and
specifically
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
his
decision,
he
talks
about
the
impacts
caused
by
nitrate
pollution.
nitrates
come
from
septic
systems,
however,
as
i
said
earlier,
mr.
palazzolo's
beach
club
application
would
involve
no
septic
systems--
mr.
james
s.
burling
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
specifically
to
avoid
any
problems
with
septic
systems
or
nitrates.
mr.
james
s.
burling
not
precisely,
your
honor.
the
baseline
of
our
claim
is
that
mr.
palazzolo
can
make
no
use
whatsoever
of
any
of
his
wetland.
now,
the
issue
of--
mr.
james
s.
burling
--traditionally
in
rhode
island
one
owning
riparian
property
has
always
had
the
right
to
fill
the
wetland.
indeed,
as
our
reply
brief
points
out,
this
has
been
the
law
in
rhode
island
for
a
century
and
a
half.
as
the
supreme
court
said
below
at
pages
a3
to
a4,
that
as
of
the
early
1960s
there
was
not
even
a
permit
requirement
to
fill
wetland.
mr.
james
s.
burling
this
would
have
to
be
looked
at
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
mr.
james
s.
burling
not
precisely,
your
honor,
because
if
the
state
is
able
to
prove
that
the
particular
application
before
it
would
cause
a
nuisance
and
by
nuisance
talking
about
a
genuine
nuisance
not
something
decreed
anew,
not
something
that
has
always
been
unlawful.
mr.
james
s.
burling
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
if
you--
mr.
james
s.
burling
--when
talking
about
what
is
and
what
is
not
a
nuisance,
it
is
important
not
to
simply
say
that
the
law
of
nuisance
is
coterminus
with
the
police
power,
in
this
case
it's
not
only
that
it
was
not
a
nuisance
beforehand,
but
also
that
the
state
has
not
proven
that
the
proposals
by
mr.
palazzolo
would
indeed
constitute
a
nuisance.
it
is
not
enough
simply
to
say
that
we
have
new
knowledge
today
and
it
is
therefore
a
nuisance,
the
inquiry
must
be
more
searching
than
that.
mr.
james
s.
burling
probably
not,
but
again,
we
must
look
at
the
individual
circumstances
of
the
case.
why
are
the
septic
systems
being
required?
if
it
is
to
prevent
a
genuine
health
and
safety
risk
then
i
would
have
to
concur
that
that
would
be
a
regulation
passed
to
protect
public
health
and
safety
and
it
may
rise
to
the
level
of
a
nuisance.
mr.
james
s.
burling
the
state
supreme
court
did
not
in
this
case
base
its
decision
on
the
existence
of
a
nuisance.
indeed
the
finding
of
nuisance
was
appealed
to
the
state
supreme
court
and
that
could
be
found
at
pages
12
to
14
of
mr.
palazzolo's
brief
to
the
state
supreme
court,
but
the
issue
was
never
reached--
mr.
james
s.
burling
--they
never
reached
it.
this
case
is
not
based
on
the
existence
of
a
nuisance
or
the
lack
of
a
nuisance.
mr.
james
s.
burling
no,
your
honor.
the
beach
application
was
the
last
application.
mr.
james
s.
burling
correct.
mr.
james
s.
burling
correct.
mr.
james
s.
burling
it
was
turned
down
because
it
lacked
specificity
and
because
of
some
general
concerns
that
it
would
impact
the
environment.
but
the--
mr.
james
s.
burling
--the
plans
needed
to
have
more
detail
in
them,
contour
lines
and
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
james
s.
burling
in
the
application...
in
the
application,
he
did
not
indicate
why
he
wanted
to
do
the
fill.
he
wanted
to
move
this
on
in
a
multistep
process.
mr.
james
s.
burling
he
does
not,
and
we
do
not
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
james
s.
burling
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
s.
burling
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
this
case
needs
to
turn
on
the
18-acre
application,
indeed
it
was
not
even
part
of
the
complaint.
i
think
the
key
here
is
understanding
that
no
filling
of
any
wetland
would
be
allowed
for
any
reason
that
was
lawful
under
the
local
zoning
code.
no
structures
of
any
kind
would
be
permitted
by
mr.
palazzolo
to
construct.
so
we
know
that
he
cannot
use
his
wetland.
for
that
reason,
there
is--
mr.
james
s.
burling
--the
18
acres
is
all
wetland.
the
upland
portion
is
the
small
road
that
i
referred
to
earlier
with
the
turn
around.
there
may
be
an
isolated
island
of
upland,
the
amount
unspecified
how
much,
but
it
is
fairly
small,
that
is
surrounded
by
wetland.
mr.
james
s.
burling
and
indeed
small
compared
to
the
total
size
of
that
road
and
the
turn
around
on
that
as
well.
mr.
james
s.
burling
the
court
never
concluded
that
it
was
20
acres,
and
it
is
probably
less
than
that.
but
i
can
not
be
more
specific
than
that.
since
we
know
what
uses
can
and
cannot
be
made
with
the
property,
the
primary
question
that
is
of
concern
to
us
is
whether
or
not
the
existence
of
regulations
in
1978
when
mr.
palazzolo
acquired
the
property
is
sufficient
to
deny
him
the
ability
to
challenge
the,
either
the
application
of
those
regulations
or
challenge
the
impact
of
those
regulations
upon
him
if
he
contends
that
that
is
a
regulatory
taking.
we
certainly
know
that
shore
gardens,
incorporated
had,
from
1971
until
the
time
it
was
dissolved
in
1978,
the
right
to
apply
for
permits
and
the
right
to
bring
a
takings
claim
if
those
permits
were
denied.
to
suggest
that
the
state
can
deny
a
permit
and
refuse
somebody
even
the
right
to
seek
just
compensation
because
they
acquired
the
property
from
a
predecessor
is
contrary
to
what
this
court
had
held
earlier
in
nollan
which
i
don't
need
to
repeat
the
entire
cite,
except
this
court
did
say
briefly,
so
long
as
the
commission
could
not
have
deprived
prior
owners
of
the
easement
without
compensating
them,
the
prior
owners
must
be
understood
to
have
transferred
their
full
property
rights
in
conveying
the
lot.
mr.
james
s.
burling
the
taking
occurred
in
1986
when
the
permit
was
denied.
the
taking
was
simply
not
in
existence
until
that
time
because
as
we
also
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
this
court
has
held
in
preseault
that
the
existence
of
a
permitting
requirement
in
and
of
itself
does
not
generally
take
property.
one
expects
that
the
government
in
good
faith
will
allow
a
permit
to
be
granted
or
will
at
least
consider
that
permit
fairly.
and
one
further
expects
that
in
the
event
that
a
permit
is
denied,
at
the
time
of
denial
a
litigant
has
the
right
to
seek
a
just
compensation
remedy
if
the
litigant
can
prove
that
there
has
been
a
taking.
mr.
james
s.
burling
there
are
two
answers
to
that,
your
honor,
a
theoretical
one
and
a
practical
one
to
this
case.
theoretically,
in
defining
what
background
principles,
i
would
suggest
that
we
go
back
as
far
in
time
as
before
there
was
an
existence
of
pervasive
regulation.
but
that
rather
theoretical
issue
is
one
that
this
court
does
not
need
to
fully
address
because
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
and
as
i
said
previously,
as
of
the
early
1960s
there
was
absolutely
no
requirement
for
a
litigant
to
obtain
a
permit
to
fill
wetland.
we
also
know
in
the
century
and
a
half
before
that
that
there
was
a
right,
not
only
to
fill
wetland
but
to
fill
tidelands
which
are
those
lands
that
are
under
water
all
the
time.
mr.
james
s.
burling
that's
the
key
here,
your
honor.
the
question
is--
mr.
james
s.
burling
--i
believe,
obviously
the
answer
is,
yes,
those
rights
still
do
exist.
mr.
james
s.
burling
yes,
your
honor.
they
existed
in
1985
because
the
imposition
of
a
permitting
requirement
that
was
adopted
in
1971,
as
i
said
earlier,
does
not
effect
the
background
principles
of
property
law.
it
does
not
change
the
title.
it
simply
requires
a
landowner
to
go
through
more
of
a
permitting
process.
it
requires
a
landowner
to
be
more
careful
about
what
that
landowner
is
trying
to
do.
but
it--
mr.
james
s.
burling
--you
certainly,
when
you
buy
property
and
it's
subject
to
regulation,
you
have
the
expectations
that
it's
going
to
be
more
of
a
difficulty
to
develop
that
property,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
that
affects
the
background
principles
of
the
very
property
itself,
the
regulation
that
you
are
challenging
in
a
takings
case
cannot
still
affect
background
principles
that
you
have
no
right
to
bring
that
takings
challenge
in
the
first
place.
mr.
james
s.
burling
it
would
not,
unless
you
are
arguing
that
that
zoning
set
back
requirement
itself
is
so
onerous
that
it
takes
property.
now
that
is
normally
not
the
case.
mr.
james
s.
burling
not
precisely,
your
honor,
because
land
is
always
subject
nowadays
especially
to
some
degree
of
regulation.
mr.
james
s.
burling
that
would
be
a
taking,
your
honor.
mr.
james
s.
burling
a
reasonable
set
back
requirement
is
acceptable.
mr.
james
s.
burling
the
property
interest
that
may
be
affected
by
a
reasonable
coastal
regulation
or
a
reasonable
set
back
is
not
necessarily
a
taking.
but
when
it
comes
to--
mr.
james
s.
burling
--absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
james
s.
burling
so
we
better
redefine
reasonable,
your
honor.
if
the
set
back
is
so
much
that
it
destroys
the
economically
viable
use
of
the
property,
that
would
be
unreasonable,
that
would
be
a
taking.
mr.
james
s.
burling
when
we're
talking
about
the
reasonableness
of
the
set
back,
i
think
the
best
analysis
i
have
seen
is
one
adopted
by
a
lower
pennsylvania
court
in
a
case
we
cited
in
our
reply
brief
called
machipongo,
based
on
an
article
by
fee
in
the
chicago
law
review.
that
sets
a
standard
that
you
look
at
the
amount
of
area
put
in
that
particular
set
back,
and
if
that
area
is
so
large,
then
that
area
by
itself
would
be
an
economically
viable
use
of
property
if
you
could
put
it
to
some
use
regardless
of
the
surrounding
property,
that
might
indeed
be
a
taking.
mr.
james
s.
burling
as
with
the
requirement
that
you
do
not
commit
a
nuisance,
of
course,
but
simply
saying
that--
mr.
james
s.
burling
--in
lucas
this
court
found
that
something
that
has
not
always
been
unlawful
is
a
lawful
use
of
the
property
and
that
as
we...
no,
we
certainly
may
learn
new
things--
mr.
james
s.
burling
--no,
your
honor,
in
lucas
this
court
also
said
that
new
knowledge,
such
as
building
that
reactor
on
the
nuclear
fault
is
the
new
knowledge
and
to
prohibit
that
certainly
would
not
be
a
taking.
mr.
james
s.
burling
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
s.
burling
government
regulates
all
the
time
that
it's
reasonable
to--
mr.
james
s.
burling
--you
are
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
s.
burling
as
quickly
as
i
can
say
before
i
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal,
this
case,
in
determining
whether
there
has
actually
been
a
taking
here
should
be
remanded
to
the
rhode
island
court.
the
rhode
island
court
found
that
simply
some
value
left
was
not
a
taking.
so
what
the
court
must
look
at
is
truly
not
simply
whether
this
falls
outside
the
exceptional
circumstance
of
lucas
and
say,
if
it
falls
out
the
exceptional
circumstance
there
is
no
taking.
it
must
look
at
the
before
and
after
position
of
the
property.
it
must
look
at
the
fair
market
value,
the
uses
of
the
property,
the
aerial
extent
of
the
property
that
can
be
used
and
those
other
things
that
an
investor
would
look
at--
mr.
james
s.
burling
--if
the
court,
not
in
the
first
analysis,
but
if
the
court
is
not
able
to
determine
that
there
has
been
a
denial
of
economically
viable
use,
then
in
a
penn
central
analysis
which
i
think
is
the
next
place
that
the
court
should
look
at,
certainly
the
character
of
the
government
regulation
is
one
of
those
things
that
this
court
said
in
penn
central
should
be
looked
at.
mr.
james
s.
burling
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
in
the
joint
lodging
that
there
is
a
map
of
some
sort
of
the
property
at
tab
5
and
you
can
see
it
on
tab
6.
mr.
james
s.
burling
no,
your
honor,
those
maps
are
not
very
precise.
what
we
simply...
on
determining
how
much
land
must
be
subject
to
that
requirement
of
how
much
you
can
build--
mr.
james
s.
burling
--there
is
no
map
that
shows
precisely
where
wetlands
are
and
uplands
are,
but
we
will
rest
on
the
state's
assertion
in
its
opposition
to
the
petition
as
justice
souter
pointed
out
earlier
that
the
state
would
allow
one
home
to
be
built
on
the
upland
area.
mr.
james
s.
burling
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
james
s.
burling
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
a
few
points
to
rebut
was
just
said,
i
think
that
when
we
look
at
what
property
has
been
taken
and
what
property
has
not
been
taken,
we're
talking
about,
are
we
only
going
to
look
at
the
wetlands
or
are
we
only
going
to
look
at
the
upland?
our
case
is
submitted
on
the
idea
that
there
are
many
ways
of
determining
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
denial
of
economically
viable
use
and
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
taking.
it
may
be
that
in
some
cases
we're
dealing
simply
with
a
large
parcel
and
we're
looking
at
that
time
devaluation
of
that
parcel.
some
cases
it
may
be
that
we're
dealing,
as
here,
with
a
situation
where
some
of
the
land
is
carved
out
and
you're
told
you
can
use
some
of
it
but
the
vast
majority
of
that
you
cannot.
the
problem
of
what
happened
in
the
court
below
is
that
they
did
not
go
through
any
sort
of
realistic
analysis
of
whether
or
not
there's
been
a
taking,
simply
finding
that
there
was
some
value
left
at
the
end
of
the
day
therefore
it
doesn't
fit
within
lucas
is--
mr.
james
s.
burling
--excuse
me,
your
honor,
i
didn't
hear
the
first
part
of
your
question.
mr.
james
s.
burling
there
are
three
independent
grounds
of
the
decision
below,
one
ground,
of
course,
is
that
the
case
is
not
ripe
and
i
think
we've
talked
about
that,
the
other
that
he
bought
the
property
on
notice
of
the
existence
of
the
regulation,
and
third
the
court
did
look
at
the
fact
that
there
was
some
value
left
in
finding
that
the
existence
of
some
value
took
the
case
outside
of
the
lucas
situation
and
therefore
it
did
not
need
to
consider
further
whether
or
not
there
had
been
a
denial
of
economically
viable
use.
so
the
court
below
did
reach
all
three
of
these
issues
and
provide
them
this
independent
grounds
for
the
taking
below.
there
was
some
discussion
previously
about
what
the
value
was
and
that
the
administrative
agency
did
not
discuss
the
value
of
the
case.
this,
of
course,
is
an
issue
for
a
trial
court
and
it
is
what
trial
courts
determine
all
the
time.
evidence
was
submitted
as
to
the
value
of
the
property,
rebuttal
evidence
was
also
submitted
by
the
state
as
to
the
value
of
the
property--
mr.
james
s.
burling
--either
way,
your
honor,
the
200,000
figure
does
include
a
so
called
7,000
dollar
per
acre
attribution
from
the
wetlands
that
cannot
be
used.
i
am
not
sure
that
that
is
a
legitimate
way
of
looking
at
the
value
of
this
property.
if
that
remaining
wetland
belonged
to
the
state,
if
it
had
been
taken
by
the
state,
which
is
indeed
what
we
assert
here,
the
value
to
the
upland
owner
would
be
the
same,
whether
or
not
title
allegedly
belonged
to
the
owner
or
not.
they're
talking
about
the
valley
from
a
nice
view.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
nice
view
has
been
taken
by
the
state.
and
so
the
true
value
of
what
the
upland
is,
if
you
do
not
add
in
this
attribution
is
probably
significantly
less
than
that,
indeed
in
the
trial
transcript,
in
the
testimony
of
thomas
andolfo
at
pages
662
to...
682
to
683
is
where
this
200,000
dollar
value
comes
from,
it
talks
about
a
few
dollars
being
spent
to
improve
the
road,
and
then
primarily
the
rest
of
the
value
will
come
from
this
attribution
of
the
remaining
area.
mr.
james
s.
burling
a
later
purchaser
of
those
18
acres,
after
attempting
to
go
through
the
permitting
process,
may
indeed
be
able
to
sue
if,
as
the
question
said
earlier,
this
area
is
within
the
economically
viable
size
of
development
in
the
area.
i
think
that
is
one
way
of
looking
at
it,
we
certainly
know
that
there
are
three
home
sites
on
fill
in
the...
immediately
adjacent
to
mr.
palazzolo's
property.
home
sites
that
are
very
small
as
the
record
reflects.
and
if
there
are
18
acres
of
developable
property
on
site,
then
indeed
that
should
be
looked
at
separately.
but
that
is
something
i
do
not
think
this
court
needs
to
fully
determine,
what...
what
the
situation
would
be
in
that
hypothetical,
because
in
this
case
we
know
that
mr.
palazzolo
can
make
no
use
of
his
wetland,
and
we
know
that
his...
the
value
of
the
upland
should
not
be
enough
to
simply
take
this
case
out
of
a
determination
of
whether
there
has
been
economically
viable
use.
mr.
james
s.
burling
because
in
looking
at
economically
viable
use,
an
appropriate
way
of
looking
at
it
would
be
what
would
an
investor,
looking
at
the
property
before
it
is
regulated,
be
willing
to
pay
if
he
knew
what
that
property
was
worth
at
the
end
of
the
day.
mr.
james
s.
burling
if
an
investor
would
pay
200,000
dollars
for
this
property,
that
is
a
different
case
from
what
has
been
alleged
below.
mr.
james
s.
burling
oh,
yes.
mr.
james
s.
burling
and
if
an
investor,
knowing
that
before
the
regulations
are
imposed,
that
that
is
all
the
value
of
the
property,
then
indeed
there
may
be
a
different
circumstance,
that
is
why
this
case
needs
to
be
remanded.
mr.
james
s.
burling
because
no
reasonable
investor
would
put
3.1
million
dollars--
mr.
james
s.
burling
--your
honor,
we
do
not
believe
it
is
enough
to
take
it
out
of
that
box.
we
believe
that
a
nonzero
value
is
not
in
and
of
itself
enough
to
avoid
an
inquiry
under
lucas.
thank
you
very
much.
