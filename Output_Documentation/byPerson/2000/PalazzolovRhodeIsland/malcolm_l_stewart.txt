mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
this
court
stated
in
armstrong
versus
united
states,
the
just
compensation
clause
was
designed
to
bar
a
government
from
forcing
some
people
alone
to
bear
public
burdens
which,
in
all
fairness
and
justice,
should
be
borne
by
the
public
as
a
whole.
and
petitioner's
regulatory
takings
claim
necessarily
depends
upon
the
proposition
that
he
has
been
unfairly
singled
out
to
bear
a
disproportionate
share
of
the
burdens
attendant
on
the
provision
of
public
benefits
or
the
prevention
of
public
harms.
in
our
view
the
record
entirely
fails
to
bear
out
that
assertion.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no,
that's
correct.
and
certainly
this
court
in
lucas
made
clear
that
even
when
there
is
no
exercise
of
eminent
domain
authority
or
physical
occupation
of
the
land
there
may
be
a
taking
if
the
burden
imposed
by
regulatory
limitations
on
land
use
has
the
same
practical
effect
as
a
direct
appropriation.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
that's
incorrect.
at
least,
in
our
view,
the
record
in
this
case
strongly
supports
the
assertion
that
filling
of
wetlands
has
been
a
very
rare
practice
in
this
part
of
rhode
island.
now
it's
true
that
it
wasn't
until
comparatively
recently
that
statutory
permit
requirements
were
imposed
as
a
prerequisite
to
the
fill
of
wetlands.
but
the
record
doesn't
suggest
that
extensive
filling
of
wetlands
has
occurred.
now,
my
understanding
is
that
even
as
to
the
dry
land
in
this
area
it
is
only
a
short
distance
above
the
water
table,
and
therefore
even
to
construct
a
house
on
dry
beach
land
you
need
fill,
but
it's
not
fill
of
wetlands
and
it
doesn't
have
the
same
environmental
consequences
as
wetlands
fill.
and
the
point
we'd
like
to
stress
is
that
the
requirements
imposed
most
recently
by
the
crmp
and
informally
by
its
predecessors
are
generally
applicable
limitations
on
the
ways
in
which
wetlands
properties
can
be
used
and
they
secure
a
reciprocity
of
advantage
to
landowners
in
the
vicinity.
so
it's
easy
to
say
on
the
one
hand
that
the
coastal
resources
management
plan
hurts
mr.
palazzolo
in
one
sense,
in
that
it
limits
the
use
he
can
make
of
the
wetlands
portion
of
his
property,
but
at
the
same
time
the
fact
that
those
prohibitions
are
imposed
on
his
neighbors
as
well
tends
to
benefit
mr.
palazzolo
insofar
as
his
tract
also
includes
an
uplands
area,
because
presumably
the
prevention
of
filling
by
neighbors
preserves
the
quality
of
the
environmental
resources
in
the
area,
most
notably
winnapaug
pond
and
in
practical
effect
the
restrictions
function
as
a
sort
of
density
restriction
that
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
think
we
can,
justice
o'connor
and
for
one
reason,
i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
the
short
answer
is
that
as
the
case
comes
to
this
court
i
think
the
petitioner
has
really
given
up
any
claim
that
the
wetlands
portion
of
the
property
constitutes
a
separate
parcel
because
the
third
question
presented
was--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
agree
that
the
argument
has...
the
point
has
been
raised
at
oral
argument,
but
the
third
question
presented
in
the
cert
petition
was--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--right,
merely
because
the
property
retains
a
value
greater
than
zero.
and
the
explication
in
the
body
of
the
petition
of
that
third
question
presented
made
it
clear
that
mr.
palazzolo
was
not
claiming
the
wetlands
portion
are
a...
constitute
a
separate
parcel
and
the
value
of
that
is
zero.
rather
the
basis
of
the
takings
claim
as
it
came
to
the
court
in
the
cert
petition
was
that
the
parcel
as
a
whole
had
a
value
of
only
200,000
dollars
and
that
that
value
was
so
small
in
comparison
to
the
purported
3
million
dollar
figure
as
to
amount
to
a
total
deprivation
of
economically
beneficial
use.
i
think
even
if
the
point
hadn't
been
weighed,
there
would
be
strong
arguments
for
regarding
this
all
as
a
single
parcel.
it
was
bought
together,
it
was
platted
together,
and
the
state's
appraiser
testified,
and
his
testimony
was
credited
by
the
trier
of
fact,
that
the
presence
of
wetland
areas
even
if
they
couldn't
be
separately
developed
would
enhance
the
value
of
a
home
constructed
on
the
uplands
area,
in
the
sense
that
a
house
constructed
on
a
20-acre
parcel
is
going
to
be
more
valuable
than
a
house
constructed
on
a
two
acre
plot,
because
you
have
open
space,
you
have
a
feeling
of
privacy
and
seclusion.
i
think
it's
also
important
to
recognize
that
the
original
investment
in
this
property
was
something
less
than
13,000
dollars,
that
is...
i
say
something
less
because
sgi
purchased
a
larger
parcel
for
13,000
dollars
and
partly
in
1959
and
partly
in
1969
sold
portions
of
it
for
prices
that
aren't
revealed
in
the
record.
so
if
mr.
palazzolo
or
his
predecessor,
sgi,
put
in
13,000
dollars
and
now
has
something
worth
200,000
dollars
he's
hardly
had
anything
taken
from
him.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
the
other
point
we
would
make
about
the
3
million
dollar
figure
is,
it's
very
important
to
realize
exactly
what
the
3
million
dollar
figure
means.
petitioner's
appraiser,
in
arriving
at
the
3
million
dollar
figure,
looked
at
a
nearby
tract,
presumably
on
uplands,
and
said
that
lot
sold
for
125,000
dollars
and
he
said
the
lots
that
could
be
constructed
out
of
wetlands
are...
could
be
made
comparable
to
that.
and
if
you
sold
74
of
them
at
125,000
dollars
each,
you
would
come
up
with
a
figure
of
a
little
over
9
million
dollars.
he
deducted
the
expenses
that
he
thought
would
be
incurred
in
actually
doing
the
fill
and
came
up
with
a
net
of
3
million--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
agree,
if
mr.
palazzolo
could
ever
identify
a
point
in
time
at
which
the
property
was
worth
3
million
dollars,
then
we
would
have
a
very
different
case.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the
point
i
was
making
is
in
your
hypothetical
the
land
would
have
actually
been
valued
at
1
million
dollars
in
the
real
world
today.
but
if
you
look
at
the
methodology
that
was
addressed
by
mr.
palazzolo's
appraiser,
he
took
as
his
starting
point
the
price
that
was
paid
for
a
comparable
lot
in
1988.
now
obviously
that
price
was
paid
in
an
environment
where
wetlands
development
in
this
region
is
subject
to
substantial
restrictions.
so
in
effect
what
the
appraiser
was
determining
was,
if
mr.
palazzolo
could
develop
his
property
to
the
hilt
and
everybody
else
around
him
remained
subject
to
extensive
restrictions
on
development,
his
property
would
dramatically
appreciate
in
value.
even
if
we
assume
that
the
appraiser
was
correct
in
that
hypothesis,
it
can't
form
the
basis
of
a
takings
claim.
mr.
palazzolo
is
essentially
asking
to
have
the
benefit
that
arises
as
a
result
of
the
imposition
of
development
restrictions
on
neighbors
without
accepting
the
same
development
restrictions
on
his
own--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
at
least
in
general
our
position
would
be
that
a
person
who
takes
with
notice
of
an
existing
restriction
on
land
use
can't
show
a
taking
by
virtue
of
the
application
of
that
restriction.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understood
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--and
think
that
the
word
unfair
is
crucial
here
that
there
could
be
circumstances--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
i
said
ordinarily
a
person
who
takes
with
notice
of
an
existing--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
certainly
if
the
person
could
challenge
it
if
the
nature
of
the
challenge
was,
this
is
an
unreasonable
regulation,
it's
not
lawful.
but
if
the
challenge
was,
this
is
reasonable
but
it
forces
me
to
bear
a
disproportionate
share
of
the
burdens
and
therefore
i'm
entitled
to
be
compensated,
we
don't
think
that
there
would
be
any
equities--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
again,
the
purpose
of
the
regulatory
takings
doctrine
is
to
identify
those
situations
in
which
an
individual
has
been--
