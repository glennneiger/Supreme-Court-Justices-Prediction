unknown
speaker
--twice
in
the
brief
in
opposition
they
acknowledge
that
the
cmrc
would
have
approved
a
single
home
site,
which
would
have
netted
greater
proceeds
i.e.
200,000
dollars
at
less
risk,
they
say
that
on
page
four,
and
again
at
say,
page
19,
they
say
specifically
the
council
would
be
happy
to
have
petitioner
situate
a
single
home
thus
allowing
petitioner
to
realize
200,000
dollars.
so
i,
you
know,
i
thought
that
was
not
in
the
case
when
we
took
it.
unknown
speaker
we
might
not
have
taken
it
had
i
thought
it
was
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
williams
used
nuisance?
unknown
speaker
because
they
were
going
to
have
portable
toilets?
unknown
speaker
but
what
is
the
basis
upon
which
you
claim
that
you
have
or
should
have
a
right
to
fill
the
wetland.
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
about
the
beach
club,
i
thought
after
the
beach
club
application
you
came
up
with
another
application
that
was
just...
just
to
fill.
unknown
speaker
was
the
second
one.
the
first
was
just
to
fill
without
any
specification.
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
turned
down.
unknown
speaker
for
what
reason?
unknown
speaker
specificity
in
what
respect?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
didn't
say
why
he
wanted
to
do
the
fill,
did
he?
he
said
i
want
to
fill
this.
unknown
speaker
why
does
he
have
to
show
why
he
wanted
to
do
the
fill?
i
mean
the
only
change
was
the
fill,
he
said
i've
got
a
swampland
in
front
of
me,
i'd
rather
be
able
to
walk
on
it.
does
he
have
to
say
he's
going
to
use
it
for
a
beach
club?
unknown
speaker
i
think
i
have
some
question,
they
did
say
that
the
owner
hasn't
sought
permission
for
any
use
that
would
involve
substantially
less
filling,
but
having
left
us
with
that
lingering
doubt
they
then
rush
into
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
what
portion
of
his,
18
acres
is
it?
what
portion
is
wetland
and
what
portion
upland?
unknown
speaker
small
compared
to
the
18
acres.
unknown
speaker
can
we
assume
20
acres
of
which
18
is
wetlands?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
very
brief
question?
in
your
opinion,
when
did
the
taking
occur
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
were
those
rights
still
extant
in
1985?
unknown
speaker
so
what's
your
answer?
what?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
not
still
do
exist.
did
they
exist
in
1985?
unknown
speaker
you
say
not
precisely,
you
would
not
have
any
problem
with
saying
that
there's
a
taking
if
you
have
a
set
back
requirement
of
900
yards
on
a
lot
that
is
901
yards
wide.
would
that
trouble
you
to
say
that
that's
a
taking?
unknown
speaker
so
is
there...
why
isn't
there
then
a
question
here
as
to
whether
this
set
of
fill
regulations
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable?
could
i
understand
what
you're
saying...
what
you
mean
by
the
word
reasonable?
i
mean
let's
take
a
60-yard
setback,
a
60-foot
set
back
requirement,
i
guess
that's
reasonable
as
opposed
to
900-yard
ones.
would
that
be
a
taking
of
a
lot
that
happens
to
be
only
61
feet
wide?
unknown
speaker
and
would
it
be
a
reasonable
set
back
requirement,
i
suppose
it
would,
but
you'd
still
say
it
would
be
a
taking.
unknown
speaker
mr.
burling,
it
is
not
your
submission
that
those
actions
by
the
government
are
only
takings
which
are
unreasonable?
surely
the
government--
unknown
speaker
--can
make
a
reasonable
taking,
can't
it?
unknown
speaker
whether
it's
reasonable
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
whether
it's
a
taking,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
reasons
for
the
regulation,
should
the
court
look
at
that?
unknown
speaker
did
you
reference
that
in
your
brief
in
opposition?
i
mean
that
might
have
made
a
big
difference
as
to
whether
we
wanted
to
take
this
case.
did
you
make
any
reference
to
the
fact
that
there
was
uncertainty
as
to
how
much
additional
use
could
be
made
of
the
property?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
too
late
now.
unknown
speaker
is
it...
is
it
your
position,
general
whitehouse,
if
someone
has,
say
a
section
of
land,
a
square
mile,
either...
a
square
mile.
and
picks
out
a
10-acre
plot
at
one
edge
of
that
and
applies
for
zoning
use
and
claims
that
it's
denied,
he
claims
to
have
been
denied
all
economic
use.
that
the
fact
that
he
has
a
remaining
everything
square
mile
minus
10
acres
means
that
that
has
to
be
taken
into
consideration,
too?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
our
cases
support
that.
unknown
speaker
we
don't
generally
get
our
law
out
of
concurring
opinions.
unknown
speaker
but
in
the
chief's
hypothetical,
what
if
he
then
sells
off
all
except
the
10-acre
plot
and
then
reapplies,
and
the
10-acre
plot
is
again
denied
to
development,
then
there's
been
a
taking.
it's
such
a
silly
result.
there
is
not
in
the
first
case,
because
he
hasn't
yet
sold
off
the
rest
of
the
one
square
mile,
but
if
he
sells
off
the
rest
of
the
one
square
mile,
and
makes
the
very
same
application,
gets
the
very
same
result,
then
there's
been
a
taking.
i
mean
that
seems
to
me
very
strange.
unknown
speaker
even
when
they've
made
it
clear
we
are
not
going
to
allow
you
to
fill
this
for
anything
unless
the
public
at
large
benefits
from
it.
i
mean,
why
do
you
have
to
keep
coming
back,
would
you
approve
this,
no,
we
will
never
approve
any
fill.
oh,
would
you
approve
this,
no
we
will
never
approve
any
fill.
why
does
he
have
to
keep
coming
back?
unknown
speaker
how
do
we--
--you
mean
the
part
that's
not
wetland?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
other
property?
i
mean
property
in
new
york,
you
know,
property
adjacent?
you
know
some
of
the
theories
of,
what
is
it,
the
denominator
is
in
these
taking
cases,
some
of
those
theories,
in
fact
urged
by
your
brother
in
this
case,
say
that
the
test
is
whether
the
area
that
remains
after
what
has
been
taken
has
any,
in
isolation,
valuable
use.
if
you
apply
that
kind
of
a
theory,
it
wouldn't
matter
whether
you
applied
only
for
the
portion
that
they've
denied
the
permit
on.
unknown
speaker
not
the
swampland,
not
the
part
he
wanted
to
fill.
you
acknowledge
that
there
is
no
feasible
economic
use
of
the
part
that
is
not
filled.
unknown
speaker
and
that...
or
for
any
other
purpose,
do
you
think,
for
any
other
purpose?
unknown
speaker
any
other
purpose
that
would
enable
any
feasible
economic
use.
well,
it's--
unknown
speaker
--so
you're
making
it
essential
to
your
case
that
in
determining
the
taking,
we
must
look
at
the
whole
parcel
and
cannot
restrict
ourself
to
the
wetlands
portion,
whose
development
has
been
forbidden.
unknown
speaker
okay.
i
mistook
you
then.
unknown
speaker
but
the
two
questions
are
the
same,
what
you
need
for
ripeness
depends
on
what
you
need
to
find
a
taking,
and
if
all
you
need
to
find
a
taking
is
that
the
wetlands
couldn't
be
used
for
anything,
then
it
didn't
matter
that
he
applied
for
nothing
but
the
wetlands.
i
think
the
two
are
connected.
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
know
the
value
of
the
property.
unknown
speaker
but
the
question
is,
what
property?
what
property?
if
the
property
is
only
the
wetlands
all
you
have
to
know
is--
unknown
speaker
he
has
to
come
back
for
some
proposal
for
developing
the
rest
of
the
land.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
a
moment
ago--
unknown
speaker
--that
the
wetlands
had
a
value
of
7,000
dollars
an
acre?
unknown
speaker
oh,
that's
determined
from
the
trial
record?
unknown
speaker
a
parcel
is
what
you
thought
it
was
reasonable
to
buy.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
do
you
know--
unknown
speaker
the
case
is
somewhat
like
lucas,
it
seems
to
me,
in
that
other
landowners
who
got
there
first
were
left
alone
and
then
the
wetlands
people
got
into
the
act.
or
am
i
wrong
in
that
construction?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
and
what
principle
governs?
unknown
speaker
whether
the
remaining
permissible
uses
of
regulated
property
are
economically
viable.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
really
think
that's
irrelevant
and
that's...
justice
breyer
suggested
there
should
be
a
cap,
that
assumes
the
government
doesn't
have
to
be
reasonable
on
an
ongoing
basis,
i
think
that's
just
wrong.
unknown
speaker
we're
not
taking
it
on
the
assumption
it's
worth
3
million,
certainly
not
the
proof
because
it
hasn't
been
proven.
but
my
hypothesis
to
you
is,
it
is
my
property
at
1
acre
is
now
appraised
at
a
million
dollars.
unknown
speaker
that
just
has
to
do
with
admissibility
of
comparable
value
testimony.
what
is
your
position
on
the
question
justice
breyer
asked
regarding
the
rights
of
successive
owners?
unknown
speaker
--mr.
burling,
may
i
ask
you
a
very
brief
question
on
the
valuing,
your
third
question,
the
value
greater
than
zero,
does
that
mean
we
should
just
assume
there's
a
value
greater
than
zero
because
the
uplands
has
value,
or
do
we
assume
for
the
purpose
of
the
case
that
the
wetlands
also
have
value
that
enhances
the
value
of
the
uplands?
unknown
speaker
well,
under
your
view
of
the
case,
if
you
lose
because
there's
200,000
dollars
worth
of
value
and
we
hold
that
lucas
bars
you,
then
some
later
purchasers
could
just
purchase
the
18
or
so
acres
of
wetlands
and
sue.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
