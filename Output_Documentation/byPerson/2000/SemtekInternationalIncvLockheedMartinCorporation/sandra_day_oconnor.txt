justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
gottesman,
i
would
have
thought
that
the
rule,
rule
41,
does
appear
expressly
to
cover
this
situation.
you
say
no,
it
doesn't.
if
it
doesn't,
then
it
seems
that
we
would
have
to
look
to
erie
and
to
hannah.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
hannah
seems
to
say
that
a
federal
diversity
court
should
apply
a
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
to
the
case
before
it
whenever
the
rule
covers
the
point
in
dispute
and
isn't
unlawful
under
the
rules
enabling
act
or
the
constitution.
so
you
would
then
have
to
persuade
us
that
the
rules
enabling
act
makes
this
rule
unlawful,
as
applied
in
this
situation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
have
to
persuade
us,
1)
the
rule
doesn't
cover
it,
if
it
does,
it's
unlawful.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
gottesman,
let
me
pursue
one
more
thing
that
i
think
bears
on
what
i'm
interested
in
and
perhaps
what
justice
breyer's
asking
about.
after
the
federal
district
court
in
california
proposed
to
enter
the
order
it
did,
did
your
client
then
ask
for
an
amendment
of
that
judgment
or
explain
the
problem,
or
ask
the
court,
look,
here's
the
problem,
we
want
to
go
to
maryland,
would
you
clarify
this
and
make
sure
that
we're
not
bound
or
prevented
from
going
to
maryland?
it
seemed
to
me
that
your
client
had
the
first
opportunity
to
do
that
and
perhaps
just
bypassed
it,
and
so
there's
no
inequity
here
if
you're
bound.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
dellinger,
to
what
extent
should
we
be
guided
by
an
opinion
of
this
court
called
walker
v.
armco
steel?
now,
that
case
dealt
with
rule
3
of
the
federal
rules,
and
rule
3
says
an
action
is
commenced
by
filing
a
complaint,
and
this
court
said,
it
does
not
determine
when
an
action
is
commenced
for
the
purpose
of
triggering
a
state
statute
of
limitations
in
a
diversity
case,
and
the
court
in
walker
said
that
the
rule
did
not
displace
the
state's
policy
determinations
underlying
its
statute
of
limitations.
it
seemed
as
clear
a
rule
in
its
language
as
rule
41,
and
in...
was
a
diversity
case,
and
invokes
the
same
concerns,
i
think,
and
yet
we
said,
okay,
there
we're
not
relying
on
rule
3's
text.
does
that
have
a
bearing
on
this?
