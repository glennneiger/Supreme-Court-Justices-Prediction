mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
gottesman
has
described
what
seems
to
be
an
utterly
unworkable
system
in
which
we
have
a
state
court
that
is
in
the
process
of
recognizing
an
earlier
federal
judgment
begin
the
process
of
deciding
what
the
federal
district
court
should
have
done.
rule
41
serves
an
extremely
important
function
in
the
structure
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
it
reflects
an
understanding
by
the
advisory
committee
on
the
federal
rules
that
it
is
very
important
to
determine
at
the
time
a
federal
civil
action
is
dismissed
whether
that
judgment
of
dismissal
brings
an
end
to
litigation
arising
between
those
parties
and
their
privities
on
the
same
set
of
facts.
it
gives
you
that
answer
so
that
everyone
knows
whether
this
is
an
adjudication
on
the
merits.
it
is
not,
as
mr.
gottesman
suggests
at
some
point,
a
complete
rule
of
preclusion.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
with
all
due
respect,
justice
kennedy,
two
responses.
one,
i
do
not
think
that
rule
41
can
be
read
to
be
merely
issue-preclusive
rather
than
precluding
the
claim
and,
secondly,
even
if
it
were
so
read,
it
would
lead
to
very
unpalatable
consequences
on
the
first
question.
this
court,
i
think,
has
passed
this
point
in
plout,
where
you
specifically
held
that
congress
violated
article
iii
of
the
constitution
when
it
tried
to
reopen
and
revive
federal
cases
that
had
been
adjudicated
and
determined
to
be
found
outside
the
statute
of
limitations
and
congress
tried
to
retroactively
extend
the
statute
of
limitations,
and
the
parties
seeking
to
defend
the
act
of
congress
said,
well,
that's
just
statute
of
limitations,
and
this
court
says
in
plout
that--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
understand
that,
and
i
will
come
to
that
point.
i
just
wanted
to
make
it
clear
that
there
is...
there's
clear...
that
what
the
court
does
in
plout
is
to
analogize
a
statute-of-limitations
dismissal
to
a
failure
to
prove
substantive
liability
and
a
failure
to
prosecute.
that
is
a
judgment
on
the
merits.
the
court
said,
to
be
precise,
the
rules
of
finality
treat
a
dismissal
on
statute-of-limitation
grounds
the
same
way
they
treat
a
dismissal
for
failure
to
state
a
claim,
for
failure
to
prove
substantive
liability,
or
for
failure
to
prosecute,
as
a
judgment
on
the
merits,
citing
for
that
proposition
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
41(b).
that
wasn't
dicta.
that
was
part
and
parcel
of
why
it
violated
article
iii.
41(b)
stands--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes,
and
since
there
are
two
issues
on
the
table,
1)
that
they
should
win
because
this
should
be
only
claim-preclusive,
which
is
what
justice
kennedy
asked,
and
your
question,
they
should
win
because
this
is
a
diversity
case.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
on
the
whole...
and
if
i
could
just
make
the
most
critical
point
to
justice
kennedy,
and
then
i'll
return,
which
is
that
the
structure
of
rule
41(b)
says
that
all
dismissals,
involuntary
dismissals
are
on
the
merits
except
those
for
lack
of
jurisdiction,
lack
of
venue,
and
failure
to
join
an
indispensable
party.
those
three
are
claim-preclusive.
i'm
sorry.
those
three
are
issue-preclusive,
and
because
we
know
that
the
three
exceptions
are
issue-preclusive,
we
therefore
know
that
the
basic
part
of
the
rule,
not
the
exception,
extinguishes
the
claims,
and
i
think
plout
makes
no
sense
otherwise.
with
respect
to
the
fact
that...
the
notion
that
rule
41(b)
should
only
operate
where
the
first
case
is
a
federal
question
case
and
not
a
diversity
case--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
let's
be
precise
about
this.
this
is
a
federal
case
in
the
sense
it
is
in
federal
court.
the
dismissal
is
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court.
it
is--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--in
only
federal
causes
of
action.
there
has
never
been
a
holding
that
a
federal
rule
whose
text
applies
to
all
civil
actions
applies
only
in
cases
in
which
there
is
a
federal
question
rather
than
a
diversity
basis
for--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--it
would
be
contrary
to
hannah
to
say
so,
because
hannah,
the
plain
text
of
the
rule
covers
both
of
these.
also,
it's
important
to
note
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
follow
the
notion
that
rule
41
provides
the
preclusive
effect
only
in
federal
question
matters
because
often,
increasingly
these
days,
a
lawsuit
will
encompass
both
federal
and
pendant
or
supplemental
state
claims,
so
that
there's
simply
no
indication
in
the
rule
that
when
a
federal
court
reaches
a
judgment
of
dismissal
in
a
case
involving
federal
questions,
in
a
case
involving
state
law
claims,
or
in
a
case
involving
mixed
claims,
that
you
don't
judge
the
preclusive
effect
by
looking
at
rule
41
and
how
it
operates
as
a
judgment
of
dismissal
in
the
federal
courts.
whether
it
is
a
federal
question
case
or
a
diversity
case,
the
federal
courts
have
a
strong
interest
in
establishing
at
the
time
of
dismissal,
whether
this
does
extinguish
the
claim
or
not,
and
their
suggestion
that,
you
know,
why
would
the
federal
courts
have
an
interest...
you
may
be
asking
whether
the
federal
courts
have
an
interest
when
it's
a
state
law
cause
of
action.
i'm
just
saying
that
that's
the...
let
me
explain
why
the
federal
courts
do
have
an
interest.
they
would
say,
look,
this
is
a
state
law
cause
of
action,
and
the
next
lawsuit
is
going
to
be
filed
outside
the
federal
court
system
in
state
courts,
but
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the
federal
courts
do
have
a
very
vital
interest
in
not
allowing
people
casual
access
to
try
their
cases
in
federal
court
and
not
be
bound
by
the
results.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
agree
with
the
question
that
california
doesn't
have
much
of
an
interest
here,
and
if
you
think
of
this,
if
we
get
to
it
in
erie
terms,
and
i
think
because
this
is
a
hannah
case
with
a
federal
rule
squarely
on
point
we
never
get
to
erie,
but
if
you
think
of
it
as
an
erie
case,
you're
exactly
right
that
california
doesn't
have
an
interest.
california
has
determined
that
the
substantive
policy
should
be
that
there
will
be
a
cause
of
action
for
business
torts.
california
has
balanced
the
interest
between
keeping
that
alive
and
the
interest
of
repose
in
favor
of
settling
at
2
years
for
how
long
that
should
be
tried
in
california.
mr.
gottesman
infers
from
california
decisions
that
california
would
not
preclude
a
suit
brought
in
maryland.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
my
point
is
this.
california
has
no
coherent
interest.
it
may
be
indifferent
to
whether
the
suit
is
brought
in
maryland,
but
we're
not
frustrating
any
interest
of
california's
in
deciding
that
we're
going
to
consider
the
dismissal
conclusive,
whereas
the
federal
courts
have
a
real
interest
in
having
federal
lawsuits
that
are
tried
there
absolutely
conclude
an
issue
so
that
parties
don't
think--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--because--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes,
right.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
it
could
well--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no,
no,
that's
exactly
where
i'm
going,
after
noting--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--not
if
you
have
an
indication
that
the
judge
is
otherwise
specified--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--i
would
think
that
that
is
a
bar.
the
only
issue
would
be
if
the
judge
has
expressly
stated,
outside
the
four
corners
of
the
page
of
the
judgment,
that
he
intends
it
not
to
be
a
dismissal,
you
know,
on
the
merits--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
i
think
that's
a
possibility,
but
i
would
go
with--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--otherwise
specifies
would
suggest
that
you--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--but
you
ought
to
stay
within
the
four
corners
of
the
order,
and
if
the
judge
doesn't
specify
otherwise,
it
is
claim-preclusive,
and
there
is
an
opportunity
at
that
moment--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
it
does.
it
does
mean
that,
and
that's--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that
is
right,
because
the
federal
court
system
sets
its
own
rule
for
when
a
dismissal
is
on
the
merits
and
precludes
further
litigation
of
that
claim.
the
federal
interest
in
that--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--let
me
go--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
let
me
go
directly
to
that
point.
almost
all
of
their
arguments
are
in
fact
arguments
that
judge
collins,
the
federal
district
judge,
got
it
wrong.
to
the
extent
that
they
believe
that
she
got
it
wrong...
and
there
are
a
number
of
different
arguments
you
could
make.
you
could
make
the
argument
that
justice
scalia
is
making
that
judge
collins
should
have
thought,
and
counsel
for
semtek
should
have
argued
to
her,
don't
make
this
dismissal
a
dismissal
on
the
merits.
specify
otherwise,
for
any
one
of
a
number
of
reasons,
either
because
we
think
that
it...
since
this
is
a
state
law
matter,
state
law
doesn't
make
it
preclusive.
they
didn't
do
that.
they
did
not,
after
the
dismissal
comes
down,
and
not
only
under
rule
41...
they
didn't
file
under
rule
59(e)--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that's
because
what
is
at
issue
here
is
not
a
determination
of
what
the
law
of
business
torts
ought
to
be
in
california.
what
is
at
issue
here
is
not
even
how
long
one
has
to
sue.
what
is
at
issue
here
is
the
effect
of
a
judgment
of
a
case
that
has
been
adjudicated
in
a
federal
court,
where
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
set
up
a
clear
system,
a
signalling
system
for
saying,
all
voluntary
dismissals
are
not
on
the
merits,
are
not
claim-preclusive,
all
involuntary
dismissals
are,
that's
a
default
rule
unless
you
otherwise
specify.
now,
there
may
be
many
reasons
why
you
would
think,
justice
scalia,
that
a
federal
judge
sitting
in
diversity
ought
to
make
a
decision
dismissing
the
case
on
statute
of
limitation
grounds
or
any
other
grounds
not
claim-preclusive,
that
the
judge
ought
to
specify
otherwise,
and
rule
41(b)
provides
for
that,
so
that
whatever
the
reasons
are,
a
federal
court
sitting
in
diversity
and
a
party
before
that
court
can
say,
you
should
not
make
this
claim-preclusive.
one
of
the
factors
you
ought
to
take
into
account
is
the
existence
of
a
contrary
california
law
on
claim
preclusion.
and
if
the
judge
insists
on
not
otherwise
specifying,
or
in
this
case
making
it
absolutely
clear,
by
saying
this
dismissal
is
in
its
entirety
with
prejudice
and
on
the
merits,
you
can
seek
relief
under
rule
59
from
the
form
of
that
judgment
and
you
can
go
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
where
they
went
to
contest
the
merits
of
the
statute
of
limitations
claim.
they
didn't
do
that.
they
didn't
take
it
to
the
ninth
circuit.
they
didn't
seek
certiorari.
if
that
judgment
was
wrong,
it
is
wrong
in
a
way
that
is
still
clearly
preclusive
under
res
judicata.
as
this
court
said--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--it
seems
to
me,
justice
souter,
that
there
are
two
federal
interests.
one
is
in
having
a
clear
determination
at
the
time
a
suit
is
dismissed
in
federal
court
whether
that
is
an
adjudication
on
the
merits
or
not.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
no,
it
is
not--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--well,
it
is
not
clear
to
me
that
the
state
of
california
has
a
clear
rule,
but
let
me
put
that
to
one
side.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
if
you
assume
for
a
moment
that
it
does,
there's
also
a
federal
interest
in
not
providing
moot
court
opportunities
for
litigants.
this
is--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--because
it
would
certainly
lead
to
a
too-casual
resort
to
federal
court
if
the
judgment
was
not
going
to
be
preclusive.
let
me
give
you
a--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--you
raise
a
state
interest.
justice
souter
raises
the
federal
interest.
let
me
preface
my
responses
by
saying
that
i
believe
the
rules
advisory
committee
has
settled
this
debate
by
the
way
it
has
written
the
clear
language
of--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--rule
41,
but
i'm
happy
to
engage
in
it,
if
i--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--it
does,
but
we
still
win.
it
does
in
the
following
sense.
i
think
that
the
best
argument
that
you
can
make
for
saying
that
a
federal
court
ought
to
apply
nonpreclusive,
ought
to
reach
a
nonpreclusive
judgment
when
the
state
rule
so
provides.
the
best
rule,
the
best
argument
for
that
would
be
an
argument
that
follows
from
walker
and
justice
ginsburg's
opinion
in
gasperini,
where
those
cases
take
the
position
that
the
federal
rules
are
to
be
construed,
although
under
hannah
they
clearly
prevail,
they're
to
be
construed
with
sensitivity
to
state
interest.
so
that
you
could
imagine
that
the
proper
thing
for
a
federal
court
to
do
sitting
in
diversity
is
to
say,
well,
look,
it
first
looks
like
there's
a
direct
conflict
between
41(b)
and
state
law,
because
41(b)
says
these
are
all
dismissals
on
the
merits,
but
state
law
is
to
the
contrary,
and
i
have
this
otherwise-specifies
clause,
so
i
can
make
an
exception,
so
i
could
in
the
sense
of
gasperini
make
an
exception
where
there's
a
contrary
state
law.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
appreciate
the
distinction,
but
it's
important
to
remember
that
any
argument
you
have
with
what
judge
collins
should
have
done
in
the
federal
district
court
is
an
argument
that
should
have
been
made
before
her
and
taken
up
on
the
court
of
appeals,
so
that
if
in
the
future
you
wanted
to
tell
district
judges
that
they
always
had
to
defer
to
state
statute
of
limitations
the
way
to
do
that
is
on
direct
review
of
a
diversity
case.
there's
a
certain
oddness
here,
if
you
think
about
it,
that
we're
talking
about
erie
and
hannah
and
federal
diversity
cases
on
review
of
a
state
court
judgment
dealing
with
a
matter
of
state
law,
because
the...
it's
just
as
if
judge...
suppose
judge
collins
had
said
that
she
was
going
to
decide
this
case,
clearly
erroneously,
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law
business
torts,
and
they
didn't
appeal
it
to
the
ninth
circuit,
they
didn't
seek
cert
from
that.
even
though
that
would
be
clearly
erroneous
under
erie,
they're
bound
by
that
and
can't
second-guess
it.
now,
i
never
got
the
question
of
the
federal
interest
here.
you
could
have
a
litigant
that's
got
a
troublesome
statute
of
limitations
claim,
because
it
involves
possible
concealment,
possible
latent
defects,
nondisclosure.
they
could
say,
look,
we
could
bring
this
in
federal
court
in
california.
we
can
try
it
for
3
years,
and
if
we
lose
on
the
statute
of
limitations
grounds
we'll
have
a
very
good
practice
opportunity,
because
it
won't
preclude
us
at
all
from
bringing
the
very
same
case
in
some
other
state.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that's
a
very
good
question,
and
it
clarifies
a
point
that
they
make.
their
best
point
under
the
rules
enabling
act,
which
has
troubled
justice
scalia
in
his
questions,
is
that
this
is
a...
all
of
a
sudden
we're
making
rule
41(b)
into
a
whole
federal
law
of
preclusion.
no,
we're
not.
we're
only
saying
it
resolves
one
of
the
issues
of
preclusion.
it
doesn't
reach
all
those
other
issues.
for
example,
you
have
to
establish
a
final
judgment
on
the
merits
between
the
same
parties
involving
the
same
claims.
the
only
issue
that
41(b)
addresses
is
whether
that
first
judgment
was,
in
fact,
on
the
merits.
it's
not
a
rule
of
mutuality.
it's
not
a
rule
of
all
of
these
other
things.
there
are
a
lot
of
preclusion
issues
where
you
would
look
to
state
law,
and
that's
a
possible
outcome,
some
of
which
this
court
hasn't
resolved,
but
those
are
not
issues
with
respect
to
which
there
is
a
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
squarely
on
point.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
scalia,
if
that
is
considered
an
alteration
of
substantive
law
it
would
raise
havoc
with
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
there
are
counterclaim
rules,
there
are
interpleader
rules,
there
are
all
kinds
of
rules
that
relate
to
and
have
some
effect
on
whether
a
judgment
winds
up
being
a
judgment
of
dismissal
on
the
merits,
and
it's
not
the
kind
of
issue
about
which
justice
harlan
was
concerned
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
hannah
v.
plumer
when
he
said,
we
have
to
be
careful,
i
realize
that
the
federal
rules,
if
they're
arguably
procedural,
take
precedence
over
state
law--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--but
we
have
to
worry
about
ordering
people's
private
lives.
this
is
not
a
rule
that
orders...
that
tells
people
how
to
order
their
private
lives.
it
makes
political
choices
that
a
state
ought
to
make
for
itself.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
if
they
mean
any--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
didn't
say
it
was
a
good
answer.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
this
court
has
never
held
that
a
federal
rule
simply
doesn't
apply
in
diversity
cases
when
the
plain
text
of
the
rule
says
it
applies
to,
you
know,
all
suits
of
a
civil
nature
under
rule
1,
and
there's
just
no
way
to
tease
that
out
of
the
rule.
i
think
that
the
uncertainty
that
would
occur...
for
many
reasons,
california
has
never
passed
judgment
on
the
question
of
whether
the
dismissal
of
a
claim
in
california
for
the
running
of
statute
of
limitations
should
preclude
the
same
claim
from
being
brought
in
another
state.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
ginsburg,
if
i
may
interrupt,
as
a
matter
of
full
faith
and
credit,
but
increasingly...
as
a
matter
of
full
faith
and
credit
if
there's
not
been
a
first
lawsuit,
a
state...
the
second...
the
second
state
in
a
case
like
sun
oil,
the
second
case
can
apply
its
own
longer
statute
of
limitations,
period,
even
though
the
first
state
has
a
shorter
limitations
period
and
is
providing
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i'm
sorry.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
thank
you.
