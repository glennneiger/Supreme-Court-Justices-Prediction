justice
john
paul
stevens
--can
i
throw
a
question
in,
just
one
here?
does
the
form
of
the
judgment
make
a
difference
to
you?
in
other
words,
if...
supposing
that
if
the
judge
had
said,
if
i
dismiss
this,
this
won't
hurt
you
because
you
can
sue
in
maryland,
but
then
he
entered
a
judgment
which
did
not
get
outside
the
rule,
would
the
rule
trump
his...
would
the
rule
require
that
they
could
not
proceed
in
maryland
even
though
he
thought
they
could?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
enters
the
same
judgment
he
enters
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's
a
matter
of
subjective
intent
of
the
judgment,
of
the
judge
who
enters
the
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
also
finally
resolve
the
merits
of
the
question
whether
the
statute...
whether
the
claim
is
barred
by
the
california
statute
of
limitations.
that
issue
is
resolved
on
the
merits.
