justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
happens
if
we
have
a
litigated
case,
a
litigated
diversity
case
in
the
federal
court
and
a
judgment
is
entered,
and
then
a
question
arises
as
to
the
preclusive
effect
of
that
judgment,
any
of
the
many
different
issues
surrounding
res
judicata?
is
it
established,
or
is...
are
those
matters
adjudicated...
are
they
determined
as
a
matter
of
state
law
or
federal
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
asking...
it
must
arise
fairly
often.
a
judgment's
entered.
it's
a
diversity
case
and
plaintiff
wins,
and
now,
later
on,
there
is
a
question
in
any...
in
another
federal
court
to
make
it
simple,
as
to
what
the
meaning
of
that
litigated
judgment
is
in
terms
of
res
judicata.
does
that
second
federal
judge
look
to
the
state
law,
or
is
there
some
kind
of
federal
law
on
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
and
if
there
is
a
precedent,
i
mean,
the
obvious
thing
is
they
should
be
treated
similarly.
that's
your
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
was
just
looking
for
a
precedent
on
that
and
i
didn't
find
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no,
there
are
all
kinds
of...
you
know,
peripheral
matters--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
my
law
clerk
told
me
that
it's
split
on
that,
that
there's
a
split
in
the
circuits.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
we're
really
deciding
that
when
we
decide
this,
i
guess.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
where
that's
likely
to
come
up,
i
think
would
be,
you
could
imagine
a
federal
court
dismissing
on
the
ground
that
this
is
no
legal
issue,
that
the
state
has
a
rule
that
if
it
was
a
pro
se
litigant
you
get
two
or
three
chances.
then
what
happens?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
justice--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
just
don't
want
you
to
lose,
before
you
sit
down,
justice
o'connor's
argument
that
she
just
asked
about,
why
would
it
be
a
violation
of
erie?
that
is,
another
way
of
looking
at
this
is,
what
you've
all
described,
you've
described
what
california
does
that
isn't
a
judgment
on
the
merits,
so
the
district
court
here
used
the
wrong
word.
it
made
a
mistake.
it
wasn't
dismissing
it
on
the
merits,
or
it
shouldn't
have,
but
it
did,
so
your
remedy
was
to
appeal
from
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it
says
on
the
merits,
it
means
on
the
merits,
and
what
you
all
want
is
something
that
wasn't
on
the
merits.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
if...
i'm
just
trying
to
get
you
to
respond
to
the
question
of,
assuming
you
lost
on
the
point
about
what
it
means,
then
would
this
in
fact
violate
erie,
et
cetera?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why?
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
no,
i
mean,
i'm
just
going
to
say
i'm
surprised,
i
thought
your
answer
was
going
to
be,
and
tell...
perhaps
it
isn't...
that
california
has
no
interest
in
preventing
them
from
suing
in
maryland,
maryland
has
no
interest,
and
the
federal
courts
have
no
interest,
and
what
they
should
have
done
is
just
say,
don't
dismiss
it
on
the
merits.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
all,
and
they
didn't
say
it.
i
thought
that...
now
you
didn't
say
that,
so
i'm
sort
of
interested.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
thought
your
point
was,
you
know,
a
dismissal
on
the
merits
is
a
dismissal
on
the
merits--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
maybe
they're
right,
therefore
the
thing
to
do
is
say,
judge...
you
see,
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
isn't...
again,
isn't
your
answer
the
same
as
before?
you
say,
of
course
the
federal
court
here
should
have
allowed
another
suit
to
be
brought
in
california.
that's
why
it
says,
unless
the
court
otherwise
specifies.
the
lawyer's
supposed
to
say,
judge,
california
doesn't
dismiss
this
on
the
merits.
what
california
does
is
just
bar
you
under
the
statute
of
limitation.
that's
why
those
words
are
in
the
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
is
that
right,
or--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--don't
say
i'm
right
if
i'm
not,
please.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's...
can
you
answer
my
other
question
that
i
had
before?
i
was
not
just
trying
to
be
helpful
to
you.
i
was
trying
to
build
up
to
a
question
that
i
have.
[laughter]
that
the...
imagine
we
have
a
piece
of
paper,
which
is
called
a
judgment,
after
litigation
in
federal
court
on
a
diversity
case
and
it
says,
defendant
wins.
now,
a
lot
of
questions
can
arise
as
to
the
res
judicata
effect
of
that,
peripheral
questions,
privity,
parties,
et
cetera.
don't
we
normally
use
state
law
to
determine
the
meaning
of
that
piece
of
paper
called
the
judgment,
which
came
out
of
diversity
after
litigation,
or
do
we?
i'm
not
positive.
and
then,
of
course,
i'm
thinking
if
we
do,
shouldn't
we
get
to
the
same
result
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--was
your
answer
to
me,
then,
that
the
words,
on
the
merits,
are
not
peripheral
because
if
they
mean
anything
they
mean
claim
preclusion--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
therefore,
if
you
apply
it,
you
can't
just
look
to
state
law
because
that
would
make
the
words
meaningless
in
that
heartland
issue,
and
if
you
put
that...
you
applied
it
where
it's
not
applied,
that's
just
a
mistake
like
any
other
court,
any
other
federal
court.
that's...
is
that
what
your
answer
is?
