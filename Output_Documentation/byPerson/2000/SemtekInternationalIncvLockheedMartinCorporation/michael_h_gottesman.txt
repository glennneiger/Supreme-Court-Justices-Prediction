mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
business
tort
action
based
entirely
on
state
law,
filed
in
the
maryland
state
court.
the
suit
was
filed
within
maryland's
time
limits,
but
the
maryland
courts
believed
that
they
could
not
entertain
the
suit
because
it
was
barred
by
operation
of
rule
41(b)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
it
was
barred,
they
believed,
because
a
federal
district
court
in
california
had
dismissed
an
earlier
assertion
of
the
claim
on
the
ground
that
it
was
untimely
under
the
california
statute
of
limitations
and
it
declared
that
dismissal
to
be
on
the
merits.
now,
that
earlier
california
case
had
been
filed
by
the
plaintiffs
in
state
court
and,
of
course,
we
now
know
it
was
untimely.
if
the
case
had
remained
in
state
court
and
had
been
dismissed
as
untimely
by
the
state
court,
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
under
california
law
it
would
not
have
precluded
the
suit
in
maryland,
and
that's
because
the
california
supreme
court
has
stated
repeatedly
that
dismissals
based
on
the
statute
of
limitations
do
not
extinguish
the
substantive
right.
so
far
as
california
is
concerned--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
certainly
if
it...
if
maryland
was
borrowing
the
california
statute
of
limitations
it
would
certainly
have
to
give
credit,
but
even
if
it
was
relying--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
i
think
if
it
was
a
disputed
issue
of
fact
it
would
probably
be
collaterally
estopped.
there
would
be
issue
preclusion.
but
of
course
maryland
might
have
a
different
definition
of
what
constitutes
fraud,
in
which
case
the
finding
of
fact
in
california
would
not
necessarily
dispose
of
the
comparable
question
under
the
maryland
statute
of
limitations.
there
was
a
close
question
here
about
exactly
how
much
knowledge
do
you
have
to
have
to
be
compelled
to
file.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
it
might
have
issue-preclusive
effect,
but
what
the
california
supreme
court
has
been
very
clear
about
is
that
so
far
as
your
right
to
assert
the
underlying...
you
still
possess
your
underlying
tort
rights,
this
being
a
tort
suit,
even
though
we
have
dismissed
this
suit
on
the
basis
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
surely,
if
california
had
a
statute
and
it
was
construed
to
mean
that
it
bars
the
right,
then
yes,
that
would
preclude
you
going
to
another
state.
we
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
but
here,
california
is
clear
that
its
general
statutes
of
limitations
do
not
have
that
effect.
now,
as
a
result,
when
the
defendant
removed
the
california
case
to
the
federal
court
and
immediately
moved
to
dismiss,
so
it's
clear
that
it
understood
at
the
time
it
was
removing,
we're
going
to
move
to
dismiss
this
case
based
on
the
statute
of
limitations,
but
by
moving
it
from
the
state
court
to
the
federal
court
and
getting
the
exact
same
ruling,
a
ruling
on
california
law,
because,
of
course,
the
federal
court
was
obliged
to
apply
the
state's
statute
of
limitations,
by
getting
that
ruling
in
a
federal
court,
it
is
now
claimed,
and
the
maryland
courts
accepted
the
claim,
that
the
rights
which
california's
statute
of
limitations
preserve
had
been
extinguished
because
the
statute
of
limitations
was
applied
by
the
federal
court.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
that's...
as
this
court
has
said
in
the
o'melveny
&
myers
case,
it's...
you
know,
it...
there's
a
little
riddle
attached
to
that.
we...
i
mean,
if
erie,
for
example,
is
a
federal
rule,
if
dupasseur
is
a
federal
rule,
then
yes,
we
would
agree
that
it
is
a
federal
rule,
but
the
federal
rule
is
that
the
state's
determination
controls,
so
in
some
sense,
clearly
it
is
a
federal
rule,
because
this
court
decides
what
law
applies.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
absolutely,
that
we
regard
as
the
critical...
for
us,
the
critical
threshold
question
is,
we
must
persuade
you
that
rule
41(b)
is
not
a
rule
of
preclusion,
or
that
if
it
is,
it
violates
the
rules
enabling
act,
because
it
is
substantive,
and
so
let
me
turn
to
that.
rule
41(b)
we
submit
for
five
reasons
should
be
not
understood
to
be
a
rule
of
preclusion.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
it
doesn't--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
i
mean
yes,
we
would
prevail
if
you
said
that
in
this
case,
but
i
don't
think
that
that's...
analytically
it's
not
our
position
that
it
is
a
rule
of
preclusion,
but
only
issue
preclusion.
we--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
surely,
but
i
understand
the
question
to
be,
what
if
an
issue
was
adjudicated,
would
the
party
be
barred
from
relitigating
that
issue.
i
think
the
answer
is,
they
may
well
be
barred,
but
it's
not
41(b)
that
causes
the
bar.
they'll
be
barred
because
whether
you
apply
federal
or
state
law,
issue
preclusion
rules
generally
are--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes,
five
reasons.
the
first
is
the
text,
and
i'll
come
to
that.
let
me
just
rattle
off
the
five,
and
then
i'll
go
back
and
talk
about
each
of
them
if
time
permits.
the
first
is
the
text.
it
is
not
by
its
terms
a
rule-preclusion
provision.
secondly,
that's
not
inadvertent.
as
the
advisory
committee
notes,
and
states
repeatedly,
the
federal
rules
do
not
state
rules
of
preclusion
and
it
would
be
improper
if
they
attempted
to
do
so,
because
such
rules
are
substantive.
the
third
is
this
court's
decisions
since
the
federal
rules
were
enacted.
now,
this
court
has
not
had
a
preclusion
case
involving
a
state
law
diversity
action
since
the
rules
were
enacted,
but
it's
had
a
number
of
federal
question
cases,
and
so
it's
had
an
opportunity
to
discuss
what
are
the
sources
of
the
preclusion
rule
that
the
court
applies
in
federal
question
cases
and
it
has
never
suggested
that
the
source
is
rule
41(b).
quite
the
contrary,
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
these
rules
of
preclusion
are
judge-made
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
we
have
the
power
to
determine
when
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
are
appropriate,
et
cetera,
so
that
it's
clear
that
this
court
does
not
understand
rule
41(b)
to
be
directing
the
answer
to
rule
preclusion
questions.
the
fourth,
and
i
hope
i
have
time
to
explain
this,
is
that
the
rule
would
be
incongruous
and
in
some
respects
implausible
in
operation
if
it
were
a
rule
preclusion
law,
and
the
fifth
is
that
it
would
violate
the
rules
enabling
act
and
would
undermine
important
questions
of
sensitivity
to
state
interests,
these
being
things
that
would
cause
the
court,
when
in
doubt,
to
interpret
it
as
not
being
a
rule
of
preclusion.
let
me
start
with
the
text,
because
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is
principally
that
the
words
of
41(b)
are
a
rule
of
preclusion.
the
words
of
41(b)
are
that
a
dismissal,
unless
it's
in
one
of
the
exceptions,
quote,
operates
as
a
judgment
on
the
merits,
end
quote.
now,
it
doesn't
say
how
a
judgment
on
the
merits
operates.
often,
judgments
on
the
merits
do
operate
to
be
rule...
to
be
claim-preclusive.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
if
they
were
state
matters
that
were
adjudicated
we
would
suggest
it
would
be
state
law.
there
is--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
we
believe
that
the
judge
looks
to
state
law.
it
may
be
a
federal
rule
that
is
using
the
state
law,
but
we
believe
that
the
question
of
its--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
your
honor,
good
phrase
for
it.
federal
law
renvoi
is
what
justice
scalia
said,
and
i
think--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
don't
know
of
a
case
like
that,
and
part
of...
one
of
the
reasons
is
that
in
all
50
states
if
you
had
a
case
litigated
on
the
true
merits
to
a
judgment,
everybody
would
regard
that
as
claim-preclusive,
so
the
issue
would
never
arise.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
in
the
circuits,
just
as
there
is
a
split
on
this.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
the
first
step
is
to
decide
whether
rule
41(b)
is
the
controlling
answer.
if
it's
not,
you
then
have
to
decide,
well,
if
it's
not,
what
is,
and
i...
that's
the
second
part
of
our
argument,
and
our
argument
for
what
is,
is
that
dupasseur
or
erie,
we
think
they
are
both
actually
grounded
in
exactly
the
same
principles.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
we
would
agree
that
it
would
be
preclusive,
but
not
because
41(b)
says
so.
41(b)
says
it's
on
the
merits,
and
california
would
regard
that
as--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--we
think
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
second
suit
is
filed
in
the
state
court
or
a
federal
court,
that
either
way
preclusion
is
determined
by
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
original
judgment
was
rendered,
because
it's
there
that
a
ruling
or
judgment
gets
its
preclusive
effect,
and
whatever
court
is
receiving
that,
or
is
considering
that
in
a
second
case,
must
refer
back
to
the
first
case
to
determine
that.
so
as
we
understand
what
the
right
answer
should
be,
it
would
not
matter
whether
the
second
case
is
in
a
state
court
or
a
federal
court.
the
question
is,
is
what
happened
in
that
first
court
preclusive
of
the
suit
that's
being
filed
in
the
second
court,
and
we
have
to
answer
that
by
looking
to
the
law
that
appropriately
applies
to
the
first
ruling.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
we
think
in
that
case
the
dismissal
is
not
for
a
reason
of
state
law.
in
the
case
that
your
honor
is
describing,
the
dismissal
is
for
behavior
in
front
of
a
federal
court,
a
matter
which
the
federal
court
polices
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
if
that's
what
causes
the
dismissal,
then
we
would
agree
that
there
is
certainly
at
least
a
strong
argument
and
maybe
a
compelling
argument
that
a
federal
rule
of
preclusion
would
apply
to
that,
but
the
federal
rule
of
preclusion
still
would
not
be
41(b).
the
federal
rule
of
preclusion
would
be
something
independent
of
that.
but...
in
other
words,
to
us
it's
not
just
that
it's
a
diversity
case
that's
important
here.
it's
a
diversity
case
that
was
dismissed
for
a
reason
of
state
law.
that
being
so,
we
need
to
know
whether
that
reason
of
state
law
precludes,
and
california
says
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
if
the
frivolous...
if
it
is
a
penalty
sanction,
if
adjudication
is
simply,
you
have
obviously
not
stated
a
claim--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--under
state
law,
then
because
it
is
under
state
law
it
is
the
state
preclusion
rule
that
would
apply.
if
what
the
court
is
saying
is,
you
are
being
vexatious
and
we
want
to
punish
you
by
the
dismissal
of
your
lawsuit,
that
might
be
federal,
because
then
the
animus
for
the
ruling
is
not
state
law
but
something
about
the
federal
court
and
the
federal
court's--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--it
gets
harder,
your
honor.
[laughter]
i
grant
that
it's
harder,
but
i
can
identify
what
the
principle
is.
it's
just
the
application
of
it
to
all
these
cases.
each
one
of
them
is
an
interesting
question.
the
principle
is
that
if
this
is
a
decision
that...
if
the
dismissal
by
the
federal
court
is
rooted
in
state
law,
then
state
law
controls
the
preclusive
effect
of
that
dismissal.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
once
you
move...
and
that's
our
case.
once
you
move
me
away
from
that
and
start
introducing
federal
elements
that
induce
the
dismissal,
the
case
becomes
more
complicated.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--that
is,
i
think,
a
difficult
middle
ground
case,
and
it
was
actually
addressed
by
the
advisory
committee
to
the
rules,
not
in
the
case
of
rule
13,
which
is
what
your
honor
is
referring
to.
the
same
issue
arises
under
rule
23(b)(3),
the
class
action
provision.
what
if
people
don't
opt
out
of
a
(b)(3)
class?
are
they
then
precluded...
if
they
lose,
if
the
class
loses,
are
they
precluded
from
bringing
their
own
lawsuit
in
another
court?
when
rule
23(b)(3)
and
(c)
were
drafted
the
advisory
committee
said,
we
cannot
state
in
the
rules
that
your
failure
to
opt
out
means
you
are
bound
because
we
are
not
allowed,
by
the
rules
enabling
act,
to
declare
what
the
res
judicata
effect
of
that
is,
so
all
we
say
in
the
rules
is,
if
you
don't
opt
out
of
the
class
you
will
be,
quote,
included
in
the
judgment,
and
it
will
be
then
for
those
who
determine
what
the
preclusion
rules
are
to
determine
what
that
means,
and
we
think
they're
likely
to
say
that
that
means
that
they
are
preclusive,
but
that's
not
for
us
to
say.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
we
think,
your
honor,
that
the
question
is
then
answered
by
either
dupasseur
and
that
line
of
cases
which,
if
rule
41(b)
did
not
overturn
that,
which
is
what
our
first
position
is,
then
that
is
still
the
law
of
this
court.
now,
of
course,
one
more
thing
has
intervened
since
dupasseur,
and
that
is
this
court's
decision
in
erie,
and
this
court's
decision
in
erie
would
independently
suggest
that
if
this
is,
quote,
substantive
in
the
sense
that
erie
makes
the
distinction,
that
state
law
would
control,
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
anything
that
was
more
substantive
than
this
in
the
two
senses,
the
twin
aims
of
erie.
first
of
all,
california
law
says
that
the
fact
that
you
filed
untimely
here
does
not
extinguish
your
substantive
right.
you
still
have
it,
if
you
can
find
somebody
who
will
hear
it.
the
right
is
still
alive,
but
the
federal
court
is...
if
it
invokes
a
rule
that
would
say,
ah,
but
your
right
is
not
alive
if
it
was
issued
by
a
federal
court
you're
getting
exactly
the
opposite
outcome
on
whether
there
exists
a
tort
right,
depending
on--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes,
they
have,
your
honor.
there
are
three
different
ways
that
rule
plays
out
in
california.
two
of
them
are
within
california.
you
can...
if
you...
for
example,
if
you
are
dismissed
because
your
complaint
did
not
state
a
claim,
because
you
failed,
for
example,
to
allege
one
of
the
elements,
even
on
that
very
claim
you
can
file
it
again
in
a
california
court
if
you
can,
you
know,
write
a
complaint
that
does
state
a
claim.
secondly,
even
if
you
are
foreclosed
from
pursuing
that
claim
in
california,
you
can
take
the
same
set
of
facts
and
say,
well,
we
first
alleged
it
as
a
tort.
that
was
untimely,
but
those
same
facts
actually
add
up
to
a
breach
of
contract,
and
california
will
allow
you
to
refile
and
pursue
the
claim
as
a
contract
claim.
but
thirdly,
the
california
court
has
expressly
said,
and
this
is
the
western
coal
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
48,
that
even
if
you
are
precluded
from
coming
back
to
the
courts
in
california
you
are
free
to
go
to
a
sister
state
if
they
are
willing
to
hear
the
claim.
now,
your
honor's
question
is
why?
why
does
california
do
that?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
okay.
well,
then
i
will--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
if
this
rule
is
a
rule
of
preclusion,
then--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--correct,
or
that,
3)
that
we
are
in
fact
covered
under
the
exception
in
the
rule,
but
that
argument
i'd
prefer
to
leave
to
the
briefs.
yes,
that
is
why
rule
41(b)
has
to
be
the
threshold
point.
now,
the
reason...
in
explaining
why
it
does...
it
is
not
itself
a
rule
of
preclusion,
even
the
respondent's
brief
at
page
5
recognizes
that
it's
not.
what
their
brief
says
there
is
that
rule
41(b)
addresses
one
of
the
elements
of
claim
preclusion,
and
when--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
but
that's
not
the...
again,
the...
california
has
law
in
this,
too.
it
is
not
what
the
judgment
says
that--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
it
would...
i
mean,
i
think
on
the
merits
in
rule
41(b)
it
has
a
fixed
meaning.
i
don't
think
it's
a
meaning
that
is
variable
with
the
nature
of
the
case.
it
would
make
rule
41(b)
quite
unusual,
because
the
consistent
rulings
of
this
court
have
been
that
the
federal
rules--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
surely
they
had
the
opportunity.
we
don't
know
whether
they
would
have
prevailed
or
not
on
that,
and
if
they...
if
rule
41(b)
is
a
rule
of
preclusion
their
failure
to
avail
themselves
of
that
opportunity
obviously
will
be
fatal,
but
if
we're
right
that
it
is
not
a
rule
of
preclusion,
then
their
failure
is
irrelevant.
the--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
it
was
too
late.
the
federal
district
court
said,
sorry,
you're
too
late.
it
said
a
lot
of
things
that
suggested
that
she
certainly
had
not
intended
to--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
that
actually
turns
on
the
question--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
certainly
this...
if
all
41(b)
is
is
issue
preclusion,
then
yes,
this
issue
is
different,
because
the
issue
here
is,
is
it
timely
under
maryland's
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
claim
preclusion.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
first
of
all
it
is
there
because
it
informs
whatever
the
rule
preclusion
rule
is.
when
41(b)
was
adopted
there
were
two
preclusion
rules
announced
by
this
court,
one
for
federal
question
cases,
one
for
state
cases.
the
federal
question
rule
was
that
if
it
was,
quote,
on
the
merits
it
is
precluded
unless
we
find
an
exception.
the
state
rule
was,
we
look
to
the
state
law
to
determine
what
the
rule
preclusion
is,
so
obviously
41(b)
plays
an
important
role.
wherever
the
operative
preclusion
rule
says
that
on
the
merits
dictates
claim
preclusion,
then
it
will
have
that
effect,
but
it's
having
that
effect
not
because
of
rule
41(b)
but
because
of
whatever
the
operative
preclusion
rule
is.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
thank
you,
your
honor.
three
short
points.
first,
i
think
it
must
be
evident
that
if
respondent
is
right,
every
defendant
in
the
25
to
30
states
which
still
adhere
to
the
traditional
preclusion
rules
is
going
to
remove
every
possible
case
it
can
to
federal
court
if
it
thinks
there's
a
time
bar
question
because,
by
removing
it,
it
will
get
preclusion
unless,
and
this
is
now
my
second
point,
unless
justice
breyer's
solution
becomes
the
solution.
now,
i
want
to
make
clear
we
do
not
believe
41(b)
is
a
preclusion
rule,
but
still
i
will
address
the
question
of
whether
these
problems
can
get
solved
that
way.
for
three
reasons,
i
think
they
can.
first,
the
advisory
committee
has
said
it
is
not
the
function
of
the
rendering
court,
the
first
court,
to
worry
about
the
res
judicata
effect
of
its
decisions.
that's
in
the
advisory
committee
notes
to
rule
23(c)
in
1966,
and
that
is
a
traditional
hornbook
rule.
the
rendering
court
doesn't
sit
around
and
say,
now,
let's
see
what
the
preclusive
effect
of
my
decision
will
be.
secondly,
it
would
be--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--right.
well,
to
the
law
of
the
rendition
court.
not
to
the
court
itself,
but
to
the
law
of
the
state
of
the
rendition
court,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
you
rarely
see
an
opinion
in
which
the
opinion
ends
by
saying,
and
i
think
this
decision
ought
to
have
res
judicata
effect.
i
mean,
it
just
isn't
done,
and
the
rules
committee
said
it's
not
being
done
in
the
federal
rules.
secondly,
it
would
be
too
complicated.
preclusive
of
what,
as
justice
kennedy
asked.
every
decision
precludes
some
things.
the
court's
going
to
have
to
write
a
hornbook.
if
it's...
if
the
argument
is,
state
law
isn't
preclusive
of
certain
things,
your
honor,
you
should
tailor
your
order
appropriately,
the
parties
are
going
to
sit
there
and
analyze
the
entire
jurisprudence
of
that
state
in
order
to
write
in
what
it
does
preclude
and
what
it
does
not
preclude.
it
would
be
an
impossible
task.
and
thirdly,
it
would
mean
that
you
would
have
constant
appeals,
because
districts...
we
now
have
created
a
whole
other
issue
to
litigate
in
the
rendering
court.
parties
might
not
ultimately
decide
to
bring
a
second
lawsuit,
but
they're
got
to
worry
that
in
case
i
might
i'd
sure
better
get
this
thing
right,
and
we
are
going
to
have
endless
litigation
in
that
first
court,
and
it
will
be
a
federal
court,
because
we're
talking
about
rule
41
here.
now,
the
third
point
i
want
to
make
is
this.
there's
something
very
asymmetric
about
this.
41(b)--
