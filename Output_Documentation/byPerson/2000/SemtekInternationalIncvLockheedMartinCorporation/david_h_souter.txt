h.

yes,
but
that...
isn't
that
a
pretty
tough
argument,
because
the
text
of
the
rule
says,
operates
as
an
adjudication
on
the
merits--
justice
david
h.
souter
--which
sounds
like
issue-preclusion
language,
and
i
guess
that...
which
leads
to
my
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
is...
yeah.
assuming
that
we
accept
your
position,
what
function
does
the
phrase,
operates
as
adjudication
of
the
merits,
perform
in
a
case
like
this?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
the
federal
interest
that
in
effect
supports
your
entire
argument?
why
are
we
going
through
this?
you've
gotten
right
up
to
the
line
a
couple
of
times
to
explain
what
the
federal
interest
is
which
differs
from
the
state
interest,
but
you've
never
gotten
across
the
line.
what
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
would
have
a
clear
determination
if
you
simply
followed
the
california
rule.
you
don't
need
this
for
a
clear
determination.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
only
time
you
need
it
is
if
the
state
doesn't
have
a
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
but
we're
assuming
it
does.
i
mean,
that's
the
premise
on
which
we're
taking
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
you
say,
we
don't
want
the
federal
court
used
twice.
there
is
a
federal
system,
and
if
you've
gone
into
a
federal
court
once,
you
shouldn't
be
going
into
a
federal
court
twice,
but
why
does
that
preclude
you
from
going
into
a
state
court?
justice
david
h.
souter
--exactly.
