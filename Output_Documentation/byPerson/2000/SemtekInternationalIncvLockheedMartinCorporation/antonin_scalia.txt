federal
law
looks
to
the
sea--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
gottesman,
i
hope
you
can
spend
some
time
on
what
happens
if
we
agree
with
you
that
rule
41(b)
does
not
answer
the
question.
what
does
answer
the
question,
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dellinger,
i
don't
think
your
colleague
contests
that.
i
think
he
agrees
that
41(b),
when
it
says,
on
the
merits,
does
preclude
another
federal
court,
and
any
state
court,
where
the
question
is
a
federal
question
and,
therefore,
where
it
is
up
to
the
federal
government
to
say
what
an
on-the
merits...
what
effect
an
on-the-merits
decision
has.
but
i
think
what
he
says
is,
it's
up
to
the
state
courts
to
decide
what
an
effect
an
on-the-merits
decision
has
with
regard
to
state
causes
of
action.
now,
is
there
some
reason
why
that
can't
be
true?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
the
whole
hog,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm
not
saying
it
should
not
only
operate.
it
operates
all
the
time.
but
what
is
the
effect
of
being
an
adjudication
on
the
merits
is
only
determined
by
41(b)
in
federal
cases,
because
that
is
a
federal
determination
of
what
the
effect
of
an
on-the-merits
decision
is
in
a
federal
case,
and
what
mr.
gottesman
is
saying
is
that
it's
up
to
the
states
what
the
effect
of
an
on-the-merits
decision
is
in
a
non-federal
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
federal
cause
of
action
is
what
i
mean
by
federal--
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
excuse
me.
why
does
it
have
to
be
claim...
i
would
like
to
come
back
to
your
assertion
that
the
dismissal
on
the
merits
cannot
mean
one
thing
for
purposes
of
a
federal
claim
and
something
else
for
purposes
of
a
state
claim.
we've
heard
that
california
allows
you
to
rebring
the
same
claim
that
has
been
dismissed
on
the
merits
because
you've
left
out
one
of
the
elements
of
the
claim.
you
can
bring
back
the
same
claim
involving
the
same
transaction.
you
put
in
the
missing
elements,
and
you're
allowed
to
proceed,
even
though
there
has
been
a
dismissal
on
the
merits.
now,
that's
not
what
a
dismissal
on
the
merits
means
in
the
federal
system.
it
means
something
quite
different.
now,
what
if
you
have
a
dismissal
in
a
federal
court
in
california
on
the
merits?
does
that
mean
that
that
suit
cannot
be
rebrought
even
in
a
california
state
court,
when
you
put
in
an
additional
element
that
should
have
been
put
in
in
the
original
complaint?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
dictating
the...
california's
own
res
judicata
effect
as
to
what
should
be
the
effect
of
a
judgment?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
saying
because
they
didn't,
what
would
not
have
been
preclusive
under
state
law
has
now
been
made
preclusive
by
this
federal
judgment,
and
that
brings
you
right
up
against
the
proposition
that
rule
41(b)
cannot
make
any
substantive
change.
i
think
that's
a
massive
substantive
change,
to
say
that
a...
an
adjudication
that
under
state
law
would
not
prevent
further
state
litigation,
now,
because
a
federal
judge
has
said
this
is
on
the
merits
will
preclude
further
state
litigation.
why
isn't
that
a
substantive
alteration,
which
the
federal
rules
should
not
be
able
to
produce?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're
just
saying
that,
then,
it's
only
changing
a
very
tiny
bit
of
substantive
law.
i
mean,
it's
still
changing
substantive
law,
even
if
it's
a
tiny
bit.
the
fact
is
that
if
a
dismissal
on
the
basis
of
the
statute
of
limitations
under
state
law
would
not
prevent
the
plaintiff
from
bringing
the
suit
again,
and
if
a
federal
court,
whether
by
mistake
or
not...
whether
by
mistake
or
not...
makes
a
dismissal
on
the
basis
of
the
statute
of
limitations
and
says
it
shall
preclude
further
actions
under
state
law,
you're
going
to
allow
that
to
govern.
i
think
that
is
an
alteration
of
substantive
law.
now,
it
maybe
just
a
tiny
bit
of
substantive
law,
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
seems
to
me
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
a
good
answer,
because
they
wouldn't--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
they
would
not
make
the
words
meaningless,
you
acknowledge,
in
those
cases
where
you're
dealing
with
a
federal
cause
of
action
and
where
it
is
within
the
power
of
the
federal
courts
to
say
what
the
effect
of
a
judgment
on
the
merits
is.
that's
enough
to
give
the
words
meaning.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
second
decision
i
have
to
announce
is
in
case
no.
99-1551,
semtek
international,
inc.
versus
lockheed
martin
corporation.
that
case
comes
to
us
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
maryland
court
of
special
appeals.
petitioner
semtek
filed
suit
against
respondent
lockheed
martin
in
california
state
court
alleging
breach
of
contract
and
various
business
torts.
respondent
removed
this
suit
to
california
federal
district
court
based
on
diversity
of
citizenship
and
successfully
moved
to
dismiss
the
case
on
the
merits
as
barred
by
california’s
statute
of
limitations.
petitioner
then
brought
suit
in
maryland
state
court
alleging
the
same
causes
of
action
which
were
not
time
barred
under
maryland’s
statute
of
limitations.
that
court
dismissed
the
case
on
the
grounds
of
res
judicata.
in
affirming
the
maryland
court
of
special
appeals
held
that
regardless
of
whether
california
would
have
accorded
claim-preclusive
effect
to
a
statute
of
limitations
dismissal
by
one
of
its
own
courts,
the
california
federal
court’s
dismissal
barred
the
maryland
complaint.
it
did
so,
the
court
reasoned
because
the
res
judicata
effect
of
federal
diversity
judgments
is
prescribed
by
federal
law,
under
which
the
earlier
dismissal
was
on
the
merits
and
thus
claim-preclusive.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
41(b)
provides
that
unless
the
court
“otherwise
specifies”
an
involuntary
dismissal
other
than
a
dismissal
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
improper
venue
or
failure
to
join
a
party
under
rule
19
“operates
as
an
adjudication
upon
the
merits”.
respondent
contends
that
this
rule
controls
the
outcome
of
this
case.
we
disagree.
although,
the
original
connotation
of
a
judgment
on
the
merits
was
one
that
passes
directly
on
the
substance
of
a
claim
and
will
thus
be
claim
preclusive.
the
meaning
of
the
term
has
undergone
change
and
it
no
longer
necessarily
designates
a
“judgment
effecting
claim
preclusion”.
there
are
number
of
reasons
for
believing
it
does
not
bear
that
meaning
in
rule
41(b).
it
would
be
peculiar
to
announce
a
federally
prescribed
rule
on
claim
preclusion
in
a
default
rule
for
determining
a
dismissal’s
import
which
is
what
41(b)
is,
or
to
find
a
rule
governing
the
effect
to
be
accorded
federal
judgments
by
other
courts
ensconced
in
rules
governing
the
internal
procedures
of
the
rendering
court
itself.
indeed
such
a
rule
would
arguably
violate
the
jurisdiction
limitation
of
the
rules
enabling
act
which
provides
that
the
rules
shall
not
abridge,
enlarge
or
modify
any
substantive
right.
moreover,
as
so
interpreted
the
rule
would
in
many
cases
violate
the
federalism
principle
of
erie
railroad
versus
tompkins
by
engendering
substantial
variations
in
outcomes
between
state
and
federal
litigation
which
would
likely
influence
the
choice
of
forum.
finally
this
court
has
never
relied
upon
rule
41(b)
when
recognizing
the
claim
preclusive
effect
of
federal
judgments
in
federal
question
cases
as
oppose
to
diversity
cases.
we
think
the
key
to
the
meaning
of
“operates
as
an
adjudication
upon
the
merits,”
in
rule
41(b)
is
to
be
found
in
rule
41(a)
which
makes
clear
than
an
adjudication
upon
the
merits
is
simply
the
opposite
of
a
dismissal
without
prejudice
that
is
to
say.
it
is
a
dismissal
that
prevents
refilling
of
the
same
claim
in
the
same
court.
that
is
undoubtedly
a
necessary
condition
for
claim
preclusive
effect
in
other
courts,
but
it
is
not
a
sufficient
condition.
we
think
the
claim
preclusive
effect
of
a
federal
court
dismissal
in
a
diversity
case
is
governed
not
by
rule
41(b)
but
by
court
determined
federal
common
law,
as
it
is
in
federal
question
cases
where
we
have
long
held
that
states
cannot
give
federal
court
judgments
merely
whatever
effect
they
would
give
there
own
judgments
but
must
accord
them
the
effect
that
this
court
prescribes.
as
to
what
the
court
determined
federal
common
law
rule
ought
to
be
since
state
rather
than
federal
substantive
law
is
at
issue
in
these
diversity
cases
there
is
no
need
for
a
uniform
federal
rule.
indeed
nationwide
uniformity
is
better
served
by
having
the
same
rule
of
claim
preclusion
the
state
rule
apply
whether
the
dismissal
has
been
ordered
by
a
state
or
by
a
federal
court.
consequently,
we
think
this
is
a
classic
case
for
adopting
as
the
federally
prescribed
rule
of
decision
the
law
of
it
would
be
applied
by
state
courts
in
the
state
in
which
the
federal
diversity
courts
sits,
any
other
rule
would
produce
the
sort
of
forum
shopping
and
inequitable
administration
of
the
laws
that
erie
seeks
to
avoid.
while
the
federal
reference
to
state
law
will
not
obtain
in
situations
in
which
the
state
law
is
incompatible
with
federal
interests
there
is
no
such
conflict
here.
consequently,
the
maryland
court
of
special
appeals
erred
in
holding
that
the
federal
court
dismissal
necessarily
precluded
the
bringing
of
this
action
in
maryland
court’s.
whether
it
did
so
depends
upon
the
claim
preclusion
law
of
california
the
state
in
which
that
federal
court
sat,
we
do
not
pass
upon
what
that
california
law
is
but
leave
it
to
be
determined
by
the
court
of
special
appeals
of
maryland
on
remand.
the
court’s
decision
is
unanimous.
