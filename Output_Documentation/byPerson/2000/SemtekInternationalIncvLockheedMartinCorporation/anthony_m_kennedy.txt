would
it
have
been...
would
the
california
judgment
have
been
binding
on
maryland
if
the
same
issues
were
involved,
i.e.,
the
statute
of
limitations
are
about
the
same,
and
the
question
was
when
the
tolling
period...
whether
there
was
a
tolling
period
or
something
like
that,
and
the
california
court
had
ruled
on
the
merits
in
the
sense
of...
on
the
issue,
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
was
tolling?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
i
take
it
maryland,
a)
would
have
and
b)
perhaps
must
give
credit
to
the
earlier
judgment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
suppose
the
statutes
were
exactly
parallel,
and
the
issues
were
exactly
parallel,
but
a
disputed
issue
of
fact
as
to
whether
or
not
there
had
been
tolling?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
there
is
some
instance
in
which
california's
judgment
has
extraterritorial
effect.
that's
all
i
was
trying
to
say.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--before
you
say
that,
do
you
mean
issue
preclusion
or
claims
preclusion,
or
does
that
make
a
difference?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
can
we
say
that
it
is
a
rule
of
issue
preclusion
and
you
still
prevail?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
had
five
reasons
and
i
sidetracked
you.
i'm
sorry.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
don't
want
to
use
up
your
rebuttal
time,
but
mr.
dellinger's
brief
says,
and
he's
going
to
get
up
here
and
say
they're
running
away
from
rule
41.
they're
running
away.
why
don't
you
just
say,
rule
41
is
claim
preclusion
and
this
claim
is
different,
end
of
story?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
missed
it.
it
is
issue
preclusion.
it
is
issue
preclusion,
and
this
issue
is
different.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
question
is,
on
the
merits
of
what?
you
want
to
say,
on
the
merits
of
the
suit,
and
the
rule
doesn't
say
that.
it's
on
the
merits
of
what
was
presented
to
the
court,
and
this
sounds
to
me
like
issue
preclusion.
now,
it
may
be
that
if
you're
dismissed
on
the
merits
for
failing
to
comply
with
the
rules
of
the
court
there's
a
strong
federal
policy
there,
but
here
there's
no
federal
policy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
was
because
they
were
trying
to
reopen
the
judgment
on
the
same
grounds
that
the
judgment
was
granted.
