if
it's
an
ordinary
statute
of
limitations;
but
suppose
it
was
what
was
once
called
a
built-in
statute
of
limitations,
a
proscription
period
that
bars
not
merely
the
remedy,
but
the
very
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you,
before
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
isn't
termed
as
a
rule
of
issue
preclusion,
because
rule
41(b)
says
that
unless
it's
a
jurisdictional
thing
it
counts
as
a
dismissal
on
the
merits,
even
though
nothing
may
have
been
adjudicated,
so
it
may
be
that
41(b)
would
be
applicable
despite
the
absence
of
any
specific
issue
of
adjudication.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gottesman,
at
least
41(b)
would
govern
if
you
tried
to
bring
the
very
same
case
back
in
the
district
court
in
california,
would
you
agree
that
far,
that
this
would
operate
as
an
adjudication
on
the
merits,
it
would
be
preclusive
of
any
further
claim?
if
the
very
same
tort
claim
were
reinstituted
it
would
at
least
be
preclusive
of
bringing
it
back
to
the
very
same
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
right.
then
let's
switch
to
the
district
court
in
maryland
now,
the
federal
district
court
in
maryland,
not,
as
we
have
here,
the
state
court.
two
federal
courts.
would
the
district
court
in
maryland
be
in
the
same
situation
as
the
state
court
in
maryland,
or
would
it
look
to
the
district
court
in
california
and
copy
what
that
court
would
do?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
this
question
be
answered
en
masse,
or
doesn't
it
depend
upon
what
the
dismissal
was
for?
suppose,
for
example,
the
federal
case
was
dismissed
not
on
statute
of
limitations
grounds,
this
removed
case,
this
diversity
case,
but
because
the
plaintiff
was
recalcitrant
and
wouldn't
comply
with
discovery
requests,
and
the
district
judge
gives
lots
of
warnings
and
he
said
finally,
plaintiff,
i'm
dismissing
your
case
as
a
sanction
under
rule
37
for
your
recalcitrance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
wouldn't
be--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
isn't
that
example
that
justice
breyer
just
gave,
it's
a
federal
procedural
policy
that
isn't
going
to
go
very...
won't
be
very
effective
if
the
recalcitrant
litigant
or
the
frivolous
litigant
can
bring
the
very
same
case
somewhere
else,
federal
or
state,
so
don't
you
have
to
look
at
the
particular
reason
for
the
dismissal,
and
you
can't
say
it's
always
state
law,
it's
always
federal
law,
but
at
least...
well,
let
me
give
you
another
concrete
example.
suppose
there's
a
whole
claim,
and
it
gets
adjudicated,
there
is
a
counterclaim
that
defendant
failed
to
bring.
federal
courts
have
a
compulsory
counterclaim
rule.
defendant
then
goes
in
as
plaintiff
to
a
state
court,
brings
what
would
have
been
a
compulsory
counterclaim
in
the
federal
court,
in
the
state
court
where
it's
not
a
compulsory
counterclaim.
would
the
state
court
then
be
obliged
to
defer
to
the
federal
dismissal,
what
a
federal
court
would
have
done,
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't
you
go
back
to
the
district
court
at
some
point--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--after
the
litigation
in
maryland
and
the
district
court
refused
to
say--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
access
to
what?
this
is
my
problem,
mr.
dellinger,
with
your
position.
this
is
a
case
that
was
begun
in
california
state
court...
you're
relying
on
erie
and
no
forum-shopping...
begun
in
a
california
state
court,
removed
by
the
defendant
to
a
california
federal
court,
and
then
the
case
is
begun
again
in
maryland,
which
has
a
longer
statute
of
limitations.
but
for
the
removal
of
that
diversity
case
to
the
federal
court,
this
case,
when
it's
reinstated
in
maryland,
would
have
been
heard
under
the
3-year
statute
of
limitations
and
one
thing
we
know
for
sure,
there
is
no
substantive
policy
that
either
california
or
the
federal
court
there
is
putting
forward.
they're
saying,
we
don't
want
to
clog
our
courts
with
a
stale
claim,
a
claim
we
regard
as
stale.
if
maryland
wants
to
have
its
courts
occupied
by
old
claims,
it's
none
of
our
business.
we
don't
care
what
they...
this
is
a
procedural
policy
in
that
sense,
what
cases
do
we
want
our
courts
to
be
dealing
with.
that
kind
of
statute
of
limitations,
as
opposed
to
one
that
bars
the
right,
is
one
that's
directed
to
how
long
we
want
to
open
our
court
door.
why
should
the
federal
court
or
california
court
care
if
another
state
wants
to
make
it
longer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
nothing,
i
mean,
at
all
unusual
conjecture.
it
is
normally
the
rule
that
a
statute
of
limitations
that's
merely
a
procedural
one
you
don't...
when
you
rule
out
the
door
you're
ruling
for
your
forum
and
not
for
some
other
state.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
could
you,
if
you're
relying
on
41(b)
and
41(b)
says,
unless
the
court
in
its
order
for
dismissal
otherwise
specifies--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
point--
--but
the
plaintiff
didn't
resort--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
was
removed
by
the
defendant,
and
that's
why
this
is...
the
position
you're
taking,
frankly,
is
so
troublesome,
because
it's
the
defendant
who's
forum-shopping,
and
there
is
a
reason
for...
you
hesitated,
why
does
california
say,
we
don't
care
if
maryland
wants
to
entertain
it
longer.
it's
kind
of
a
sisterly
or
brotherly
attitude
toward
your
fellow
state
courts.
one
says,
we
have
a
short
time.
you
have
to
come
into
our
court,
say,
in
1
year.
another
one
is
more
laid
back
and
says,
you
can
come
any
time
within
3
years,
so
the
first
state
says,
we're
not
going
to
clog
our
courts
with
this
business.
if
someone
else
want
to
entertain
it
longer,
it
doesn't...
no
skin
off
our
teeth.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
i
don't
think
so,
not...
because
gasperini
was
talking
about
the
way
federal
judges
uniformly
will
operate.
rule
41(b)
is
set
up,
unless
that
district
judge
otherwise
so
directs.
that's
the
problem
with...
your
out
is,
this
district
judge
should
have
otherwise
specified,
go
up
to
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
a
big
difference
between
leaving
it
in
the
hands
of
each
individual
district
judge
and
saying,
as
in
the
case
of
rule
3,
when
this
court
interpreted
that
rule,
not
for
one
district
judge
but
for
all
them
it
says,
your
clock
doesn't
start
ticking
until
you
actually
serve
the
summons
and
complaint
because
we
want
to
honor
state
policies.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dellinger,
it
is
the
normal
rule,
and
i
think
you're
well
aware
that
in
the...
the
ryder
miller
treatise
puts
this
very
issue.
the
longer
period
of
limitation
in
the
second
forum,
the
traditional
rule
has
been
that
it's
free
to
proceed
with
the
second
action
if
the
state
has
a
longer
limitation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
wish
that
you
hadn't
interrupted--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--only
for
this
reason,
because
the
next
sentence
goes
on
to
say,
civil
rule
41(b)
is
even
more
clearly
inapposite
to
these
problems
than
to
the
many
other
difficult
preclusion
questions
it
may
seem
to
touch.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
recognition
court
must
look
to
the
rendition
court
to
find
out
what
the
preclusive
effect--
