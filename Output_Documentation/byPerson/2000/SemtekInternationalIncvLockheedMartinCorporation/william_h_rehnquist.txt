william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
99-1551,
semtek
international
incorporated
v.
lockheed
martin
corporation.
mr.
gottesman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
the
position
of
your
opponents
here,
mr.
gottesman,
that
there
is
a
federal
rule
as
to
res
judicata
issue
preclusion?
do
you
disagree
with
the
idea
that
there
is
a
federal
rule,
or
just
disagree
with
their
version
of
the
federal
rule?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
opponents
also
argue,
i
think
with
some
merit,
that
dupasseur
has
been
superseded
by
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
what's
your
position
on
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
a
case
is
dismissed
on
the
grounds
of
frivolousness,
and
that's
an
application
of
state
law.
it's
a
diversity
case,
but
the
federal
rules
provide
for
dismissal
of
something
on
the
grounds
it's
frivolous.
which
one
is
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
the
california
court
ever
given
any
explanation
of
this
doctrine,
that
it's
a
state
law
question,
you're
barred
under
state
law
by
the
statute
of
limitations,
but
the
right
isn't
extinguished?
i
mean,
have
they
ever
applied
that
to
allow
a
plaintiff
to
prevail?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
wouldn't
ask
any
question
like
that.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
gottesman.
mr.
dellinger,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it
would
be
quite
contrary
to
hannah
to
say
so,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it
would
have
to
be
within
the
four
corners
of
the
order.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dellinger.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gottesman,
you
have
3
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gottesman.
the
case
is
submitted.
