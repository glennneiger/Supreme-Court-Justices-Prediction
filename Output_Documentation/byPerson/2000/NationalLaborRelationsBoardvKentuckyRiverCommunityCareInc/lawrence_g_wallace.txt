mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
national
labor
relations
act
confers
organizational,
representational,
and
bargaining
rights
on
employees,
broadly
defined,
including
professional
employees,
but
it
expressly
excludes
supervisors
from
that
protected
class.
the
term,
supervisors,
is
defined
in
section
211
of
the
act,
which
is
set
forth
on
page
2
of
our
brief,
or
also
on
page
2
of
our
petition,
and
to
be
a
supervisor
under
this
provision
an
employee
must
have
authority
in
the
interest
of
the
employer
to
perform
one
of
12
specified
supervisory
functions,
or
effectively
to
recommend
that
such
action
be
taken,
and
the
employee's
exercise
of
that
authority
must
not
be
of
a
merely
routine
or
clerical
nature,
but
must
require
the
use
of
independent
judgment.
in
1994,
in
nlrb
v.
health
care
and
retirement
corporation,
this
court
held
that
the
board
had
mistakenly
applied
a
special
test
of
supervisory
status
for
the
health
care
industry
based
on
an
incorrect
interpretation
of
the
phrase,
in
the
interest
of
the
employer.
the
court
held
that
the
board
had
set
up
a
false
dichotomy
between
action
taken
in
connection
with
patient
care
and
action
taken
in
the
interest
of
the
employer,
which
is
in
the
business
of
patient
care,
and
in
so
doing,
the
court
did
not
at
all
suggest
that
the
problem
of
reconciling
the
coverage
of
professional
employees
with
the
exclusion
of
supervisors
was
an
insuperable
one
for
the
board.
it
suggested
some
possible
approaches
that
might
result
in
a
defensible
solution.
it
specifically
agreed
with
the
proposition
that
phrases
in
section
211
such
as
independent
judgment
and
responsibly
to
direct,
are
ambiguous,
and
the
board
needs
to
be
given
ample
room
to
apply
them
to
different
categories
of
employees.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
this
was
a
determination
made
by
the
board
in
going
back
to
the
drawingboard,
so
to
speak.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
of
course,
but
the
board
made
a
determination
that
responsibly
to
direct
in
the
abstract
need
not
be
defined
because
it
is
always
qualified
by
the
exercise
of
independent
judgment
not
of
a
routine
nature
in
order
for
these
determinations
to
be
made,
and
early
on,
after
taft-hartley
was
passed,
the
board
got
burned
by
courts
of
appeals
in
trying
to
interpret
responsibly
to
direct,
particularly
in
a
case
called
ohio
power.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
board
i
think
quite
properly
on
the
basis
of
textual
analysis
of
this
provision
holds
that
there
must
be
a
nexus
between
the
exercise
of
independent
judgment
and
the
exercise
of
one
of
the
12
categories
of
authority
that
define
who
is
a
supervisor,
because
that
is
what
is
qualified
by
the
phrase,
requiring
the
exercise
of
independent
judgment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the...
if
we're
talking
about
when
an
employee
is
performing
his
own
functions,
his
trade
or
his
profession,
carrying
out
his
own
tasks,
that
is
not
one
of
the
functions
that
makes
one
a
supervisor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
assignment
is
a
separate
category
in
this,
but
let
me
respond
more
directly
to
your
question.
if
the
nurse
did
not
have
anyone
assisting
her
and
had
to
decide
which
patient
was
in
more
acute
need
of
care,
the
nurse
would
be
making
a
professional
judgment
and
carrying
it
out.
if
the
nurse
has
an
extra
pair
of
hands
available
with
which
the
nurse
has
to
communicate
by
more
than
brain
waves
in
order
to
exercise
the
same
professional
responsibility,
and
this
is
a
less-skilled
employee,
and
the
direction
to
that
employee
once
that
professional
determination
has
been
made
falls
into
the
category
of
routine,
in
giving
the
directions
to
the
assistant,
so
that
it
would
be
in...
for
purposes
of
dividing
labor
and
management,
which
is
what
this
is
about,
in
the
category
that
also
would
include
the
journeyman
directing
his
apprentice--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
would
depend
on
further
inquiry
about
whether
she
is
making
determinations
about
how
the
staff
is
to
be
deployed
beyond
direction
that
she
got
from
her--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
would
be
much
further
along
what
i
think
of
as
a
spectrum
between
the
journeyman
apprentice
and
the
managerial
employees.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
was
stipulated
that
the
nursing
coordinator
here,
who
had
authority
to
hire
and
fire,
and
made
staffing
decisions
about
who
would
be
working
in
the
wings
of
this
facility
was
a
supervisor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
it
became
comparable
to
that,
yes.
i
mean--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
there's
also
a
finding
that
these
registered
nurses
usually
work
on
their
own,
without
any
assistance
in
performing
their
duties,
and
the
other
employees
who
may
be
present...
we're
talking
about
the
evening
hours
when
less
is
going
on,
are...
do
not
report
to
the
nurse,
whether
she's
the
building
supervisor
or
not,
and
are
performing
tasks
that
are
laid
out
for
them
by
management
in
the
facility,
so
of
course
she
would
be
using
judgment
in
performing
her
own
nursing
services,
to
the
extent
they're
called
for.
but
what
the
board
found
in
this
case,
the
regional
director
found
in
the
representation
hearing,
was
that
all
that
the
building
supervisor
designation
meant
in
practice
was
that
she
was
to
try
to
see
to
it
that
prescribed
numbers
of
staff,
and
we're
talking
about
rather
small
numbers,
were
met,
previously
prescribed
staffing--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
what...
that
standard
that
we've
articulated
was
based
on
longstanding
board
experience
with
other
employment
situations
involving
skilled
crafts,
team
leaders,
lead
men,
group
members,
who
they
on
their
experience,
or
their
superior
technical
knowledge,
direct
discrete
tasks
to
be
performed
by
other
members
of
the
group
that
management
has
assigned
to
be
members
of
that
team.
they're
not
deciding
for
themselves
who
should
be
members
of
the
team
to
perform
the
function.
this
has
come
up
in
a
wide
variety
of--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that's
precisely
my
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
management
is
deciding
who
the
team
shall
be
and
who
shall
be
in
the
position
of
the
leader.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
if
you're
exercising
one
of
the
12
kinds
of
supervisory
authority,
of
course
you
would
be
a
supervisor,
regardless
of
whether
management
prescribed
the
team,
but
that's
one
indication
of
the
limited
role
that
the
team
leader
is
playing.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
is
qualified
by
the
degree
of
discretion
that
the
particular
skilled
employee
or
professional
is
given,
and
the
degree
to
which
the
exercise
of
any
direction
to
others
or
assignment
of
people
who
had
been
put
on
the
shift
to
discrete
tasks
is
cabined
by
standards
both
express
and
implicit
in
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
think
what
you
have
said
reflects
the
facts
at
issue
in
this
case
very
accurately,
justice
breyer.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
the
findings
and
the
record
are
quite
clear
that
her
responsibility
as
the
building
supervisor
is
just
to
see
that
the
prescribed
head
count
that
management
has
prescribed
is
there,
so
to
speak,
and
in
doing
that
she
first
asks
for
a
volunteer
that's
falling
short.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
may
briefly
mention
a
couple
of
other
hypotheticals
along
the
spectrum
which
may
shed
some
light
on
what
the
board
has
to
decide
here,
supposing
a
nurse
either
has
a
broken
arm,
or
has
her
hands
tied
up
with
another
patient,
and
another...
and
a
different
patient
needs
something
administered
that
requires
two
hands,
and
she
directs
someone
to
do
that,
even
selecting
from
among
the
staff
assigned
to
her
someone
that
she
knows
knows
how
to
do
that,
that
would
be
very
similar
to
the
team
leader,
the
skilled
electrician
or
carpenter
who
is
doing
one
thing
and
asks
another
man
of
his
team
to
do
the
other
thing
that's
required.
moving
much
more
toward
management
on
the
spectrum,
if
the
nurse
is
anticipating
a
difficult
night,
and
can
authorize
someone
to
stay
overtime
in
addition
to
the
regular
staff,
and
therefore
commit
the
employer's
resources
to
decide
how
the
business
should
be
run,
rather
than
what
happens
here,
just
seeing
to
it
that
the
preordained
head
count
is
met,
that
would
move
the
judgment
much
more
toward
the
managerial
side
along
the
spectrum.
perhaps
it
would
move
back
a
bit
if
this
discretion
were
cabined
by
rather
specific
criteria
from
the
employer.
the
task
of
the
board
is
to
place
these
various
fact-intensive
situations,
and
we've
shown
them
in
many
other
areas
of
the
workforce,
to
place
them
accurately
along
this
spectrum
and
to
decide
where
the
line
is
to
be
drawn,
and
if
there
is
to
be
coherence
in
the
administration
of
the
act
in
this
respect,
it
is
important
that
when
the
board
reasonably
does
so
the
court
defer
rather
than
second-guess
those
judgments.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
independent
of
managerial
directives,
or
the
implicit
understanding
of
the
way
that
particular
supervisory
functions
should
be
utilized,
because
the
same
question
arises
with
respect
to
the
function
of
assigning,
with
respect
to
the
function,
other
functions
that
appear
in
section
211.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
because
the
exercise
of
her
own
professional
expertise
in
carrying
out
her
professional
tasks
is
not
one
of
the
12
functions
of
a
supervisor,
and
the
judgment
that
she's
exercising
in
selecting
the
helping
hands,
if
it's
merely
of
a
routine
nature
within
the
meaning
of
the
other
part
of
the
independent
judgment
clause,
would
not
make
her
a
supervisor.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
only
nurse
who
testified
said
she
had
not
read
two
of
the
three
memoranda
that
had
been
introduced
and
had
never
been
shown
it.
the...
on
page
16
of
our
reply
brief
we
respond--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--with
record
citations
to
some
of
these
factual
claims.
i
do
think,
to
put
this
in
context,
it's
important
that
the
sixth
circuit
did
not
set
aside
any
of
the
board's
findings
in
this
case
as
erroneous.
it
just
reached
different
legal
conclusions
based
on
its
view
of
what
constitutes
supervision,
based
on
the
board's--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
to--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i...
the
board
did
not
make
such
a
finding,
and
i
don't
know
the
basis
on
which
the
sixth
circuit
made
the
finding.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
they...
what
the
regional
director
said
was
that
paper
authority
differs
from
authority
in
practice,
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--all
of
the
testimony
was
about
what,
in
practice,
the
nurses
understood
their
authority
to
be
when
they
were
acting
in
the
capacity
of
building
supervisor
as
well
as
in
conducting
their
other
activities.
the
board
does
have
a
procedure
for
review
of
the
regional
director's
findings,
and
that
review
was
denied
in
this
case,
and
that
is
in
an
order
in
our
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
which
appears
on
page
34a,
because
they
found
that
nothing
requiring
review
had
been
presented,
no
substantial
issues
had
been
presented.
there
is
a
practice
of
not
receiving
new
evidence
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
unless
there
is
something
newly
discovered,
or
there
are
special
circumstances
warranting
it,
because
otherwise
the
contestants
in
the
representation
proceeding
would
not
have
sufficient
incentive
to
present
all
of
the
relevant
evidence
and
get
that
proceeding
decided
accurately.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
our
view,
and
we
have
citations
on
page
6
of
our
brief
as
well.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't
think
it's
clear.
there
certainly
is
indication
that
it's
for
the
head
count,
and
the
burden
wasn't
sustained,
and
the
burden
is
on
the
proponent
of
the
exception.
