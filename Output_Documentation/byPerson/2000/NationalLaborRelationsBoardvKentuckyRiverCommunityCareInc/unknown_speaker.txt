unknown
speaker
so
there
were
those
three
phrases
that
could
possibly
justify
the
exclusion
of
registered
nurses
generally,
and
one
of
them
was
disposed
of
in
the
earlier
case.
there
are
two
left,
independent
judgment,
and
responsibly
to
direct,
but
the
government
has
chosen
not
to
put
both
in
play
in
the
present
case,
right?
only
independent
judgment
is
at
issue
here,
so
that
if
you
lose
on
this
one,
you
still
have
the
third
swing,
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
the
government,
right.
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
the
trouble
is
that
hanging
it
all
on
independent
judgment
is...
that's
much
the
broader
way
to
go.
i
think
that
suggests
that
no
professional
exercises
independent
judgment
if
he
is
acting
on
the
basis
of
knowledge
that
is
peculiar
to
his
profession,
or
her
profession,
in
the
case
of
nurses,
for
the
most
part.
what...
you
really
think
you
can
sustain
that
position?
unknown
speaker
but
your
basic
position
is
that
professional
judgment
is
not
independent
judgment,
that
if
something
is
required
to
be
done,
and
any
qualified
professional
would
do
it
that
way,
this
is
not
independent
judgment.
it
comes
closer
to
routine.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical,
one
that
concerns
me.
let's
say
that
you
have
a
registered
nurse
in
charge
of
a
health
care
facility,
and
one
of
her
tasks
is
to
assign
the
other
health
care
personnel
to
one
or
another
patient.
she
says,
we
need
more
help
here.
this
patient
is
in
more
need
of
help.
the
other
patient
is
in
less
need
of
help.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
supervisory
activity,
even
though
it
is
based
upon
her
medical
expertise.
that's
opposed
to
the
situation
in
which
the
registered
nurse
is
merely
supervising
one
of
the
practical
nurses
in
the
care
of
a
particular
patient,
and
she
says,
you
know,
put
a
bandage
here,
you
know,
or
give
him
two
aspirins.
there,
you're
not
directing
the
employee
to
one
task
or
another.
you're
telling
that
employee
how
to
do
the
task
that
employee
is
doing.
well,
if
the
registered
nurse
is
really
assigning
all
of
the
people,
and
saying,
we
need
three
more
over
here,
we
need
two
more
down
there,
i
don't
know
why
that
is
not
supervisory
work.
unknown
speaker
sure,
i
understand.
i'm
not
sure
where
you
came
out
on
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you.
is
that
nurse
who
is
assigning
other
health
care
personnel
to
one
patient
or
another,
on
the
basis
of
her
expert
medical
judgment
of
which
patients
need
help
more,
is
she
in
a
supervisory
position,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
yes.
no,
no.
it's
her
independent
judgment.
the
owner
of
the
home
tells
her,
you
know,
we
have
30
personnel
here,
and
you
know,
some
of
them
are
in
this
ward,
some
in
that
ward.
we
don't
know
which
ones
are...
should
be
where.
it's
up
to
you
to
assign
them
where
they
should
be.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
maybe
you
can
tell
us
when
an
rn,
under
the
board's
current
definition,
when
would
an
rn
not...
would
be
an
uncovered
employee
and
would
be
ranked
a
supervisor,
so
that
she
would
not
come
under
the
act's
protection.
maybe
that
would
be
better.
give
us
examples
of
rn's
under
this
test
who
would
not
qualify
as
employees,
but
would
be
excluded
as
supervisors.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
just
the
question
that
justice
scalia
asked
about
staffing,
making
staffing
decisions,
who
goes
to
which
ward?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
in
this
very
case,
and
maybe
i'm
wrong,
but
there
is
a
mechanism
whereby
there's
a
registered
nurse
who's
the
building
supervisor
when
the
other
folks
aren't
there,
and
that
that
amounts
to
about
72
percent
of
the
time,
in
terms
of
total
hours
that
the
building
is
open,
24
hours
a
day,
and
there
is
an
internal
memo
which
states
that
these
registered
nurses,
as
building
supervisors,
are
in
charge
of
the
facility,
and
all
rehabilitation
staff,
and
are
ultimately
responsible
for
quality
patient
care.
now,
why
isn't
that
using
independent
judgment?
i
have
a
hard
time
understanding
why
a
person
under
those
instructions,
who
is
in
charge,
and
the
only
person
there
at
the
building,
isn't
exercising
independent
judgment
under
your
proposal.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
i
am
less
concerned
about,
you
know,
the
outcome
of
this
case,
whether
these
particular
nurses
were,
indeed,
supervisory,
as
i
am
with
the
rationale
that
the
board
used,
and
the
rationale
that
it
used...
i'll
quote
it
from
your
brief.
it
is
that
an
employee's
exercise
of
ordinary,
professional
or
technical
judgment
in
directing
less-skilled
employees
to
deliver
services
in
accordance
with
employer's
specified
standards
is
not
the
exercise
of
independent
judgment.
now,
if
that's
the
principle
on
which
the
board
is
proceeding,
it
seems
to
me
that
would
say
that
in
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you
before,
that
nurse,
who
is
using
her
expert
judgment
to
direct
the
less-skilled
employees,
you
go
here,
you
go
there,
she
would
not
be
a
supervisory
personnel,
because
she's
using
her
professional
judgment
to
know,
you
know,
which
medical
services
are
needed
where,
and
it
seems
to
me
she
is
a
supervisor,
on
any
reasonable
analysis.
in
other
words,
i
think
maybe
you
have
to
take
the
third
swing,
and
go
back
and,
you
know,
try
to
resolve
this
case
under
the
remaining
test,
which
is,
what
is
it,
authority
to
direct.
unknown
speaker
but
most
supervisors
don't
necessarily
decide
who
shall
compose
the
people
that
they're
going
to
supervise.
that's
usually
a
given
by
management.
unknown
speaker
why
should
the
fact
that
management
gives
you
a
team
of,
say,
30,
be
fatal
to
your
position
as
a
supervisor,
the
fact
that
you
don't
pick
them
yourself?
that
can't
be
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn't
this
turn
on
what
the
authority
to
direct
consists
of?
if
all
the
supervisor
has...
the
purported
supervisor
has
authority
to
do
is
to
tell
the
mechanic,
no,
turn
the
screw
clockwise,
not
counterclockwise,
okay,
if
that's
all
he
has
authority
to
do,
you're
turning
the
screw
the
wrong
way,
that's
not
supervision.
but
if,
on
the
basis
of
his
expert
knowledge,
he
says,
listen,
i
want
you
to
go
over
to
this
other
job
which
needs
immediate
assistance,
i
want
to
take
three
fellows
off
of
this
job,
put
them
over
there,
that's
supervision,
and...
but
that's
not
the
basis
on
which
the
board
decided
this
case.
it
decided
it
on
the
basis
that
there's
no
independent
judgment
when
you're
using
your
professional
standards,
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
much
too
broad.
unknown
speaker
is--
--well--
--i
thought
that
what
justice
scalia
is
talking
about
is
not
really
involved
in
this
case,
so
i
must
not
understand
it,
because
i
thought
there
were
three
separate
things.
one
is
a
situation
where
you
have
a
carpenter,
and
he
has
an
assistant
carpenter.
now,
the
assistant
carpenter
may
tell
the
carpenter
a
lot
of
things,
all
about
carpentry,
and
if
that's
what's
going
on,
that
isn't
supervision,
because
they're
experts,
they're
carpenters,
and
as
long
as
they're
talking
about
carpentry,
that
falls
within
the
rule
we're
talking
about.
am
i
right?
and
that
describes
the
relationship
between
the
registered
nurse
and
the
licensed
practical
nurse.
the
licensed
practical
nurse
does
things,
gives
shots
or
whatever,
so
that's
the
expertise
point,
but
i
thought
this
case
primarily
involved
two
other
things.
one
is,
what
does
the
woman
do
who
is
the
nurse,
let's
say,
during
the
night
hours?
now,
if
she's
ordering
building
people
around,
like
maintenance
people
or
others,
maybe
she's
a
supervisor,
but
there
was
a
finding
she
did
nothing.
she's
just
there,
doing
her
nurse's
job.
and
then
there
was
a
second
thing.
it
isn't
quite
true
she
does
nothing.
in
fact,
she
can
call
in
substitutes,
but
when
she
calls
in
the
substitutes,
they
don't
have
to
come,
or
she
has
little
discretion
there.
now,
that
i
thought
was
the
key
question.
when
she
deals
with
those
substitutes
who
are
coming
in
when
there's
a
shortage,
that
if
i'm
right,
that
doesn't
have
much
to
do
with
that
aspect
of
the
case
that
justice
scalia's
talking
about.
that's
a
little
long,
but
that's
how
i
was
seeing
it,
and
i'd
like
you
to
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
unknown
speaker
then
maybe
your
opponent
will
correct
me.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
we'll
resume
at
1:00.
you
may
continue,
mr.
wallace.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
i
agree
with
that,
but
my...
again,
my
problem
is,
why
is
it
that
the
phrase,
independent
judgment,
is
the
key
to
distinguishing
among
those
various
hypotheticals?
why
is
that
the
key?
independent
of
what?
i
gather
the
government's
position
is,
independent
of
the
professional
expertise
of
the
individual,
and
i
don't
see
how
that
distinguishes
among
the
various
hypotheticals
along
the
spectrum
that
you've
described.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
with
respect,
it's
not
independent
of
managerial
judgment,
because
even
in
the
case
where,
in
the
first
hypothetical,
where
she
clearly
is
not
supervisory,
she's
just
telling
another
nurse
to
do
this
or
that,
that's
independent
of
the
managerial
judgment.
it's
her
judgment
as
to
whether
this
nurse
should
do
this
or
that,
so
it
isn't
independent
of
managerial
judgment.
the
position
of
the
government
has
been
that
it
has
to
be
independent
of
her
professional
expertise,
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
can't
understand
how
that
has
anything
to
do
with
distinguishing
among
these
various
hypotheticals.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
hawkins,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
the
description
that
the
regional
director
gave.
i
looked
back
at
it,
and
he
said
that
the
only
thing
that
the
building
manager,
or...
what
was
the
term
that
was
used?
unknown
speaker
building
super...
the
only
thing
that
she
did
was
to
make
sure
that
the
count
was
met,
that
she
had
no
discretion
to
order
anybody
to
show
up,
that
she
just
counted
how
many
people
were
there.
she
was
to
assure
that
the
shifts
were
fully
staffed,
period,
and
that
she
had
no
further
authority
than
that,
so
those
are
the
fact-findings
that
were
made.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
finding
is
clearly
erroneous?
the
only
additional
duty
assumed
by
a
building
supervisor
is
to
obtain
needed
help
if
for
some
reason
a
shift
is
not
fully-staffed.
unknown
speaker
did
you
raise
that
before
the
board?
unknown
speaker
and
then
the
board
has
said
what,
in
response
to
your
statement
that
that
statement's
clearly
erroneous?
what
did
the
board
say?
unknown
speaker
you
raised,
as
a
matter
of
objection,
there's
a
finding,
the
only
additional,
et
cetera,
which
justice
ginsburg
raised.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
you
say,
you
raised
to
the
board
that
that
finding
was
clearly
erroneous.
my
question
to
you
is,
in
response
to
that
statement
to
the
board,
what
did
the
board
say?
unknown
speaker
did
it
say,
it
is
clearly
erroneous,
or
it
isn't?
unknown
speaker
did
the
board
address
it
specifically?
unknown
speaker
the
board
did
not
address
your
statement,
so
when
i
read
the
record
i'll
find,
objection,
it
was
clearly
erroneous,
and
the
board
just
didn't
address
it.
unknown
speaker
they
don't
have
a
system
where
you
raise
an...
you
object
to
an
alj's
finding,
and...
they
don't?
this
is
the
first
time
i've
heard--
unknown
speaker
--i'm
not
used
to
words
like,
rubberstamped.
i'm
used
to
words
like,
there's
a
statement,
somebody
objects
to
that,
and
then
there's
a
finding
by
the
higher
administrative
body.
unknown
speaker
it's
an
enforcement
action.
unknown
speaker
so
there
was
no...
i
take
it...
implicit
in
what
you're
saying
is,
there
was
no
way
for
you
to
raise
a
specific
objection
to
that
finding
before
the
board
itself,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
you
say,
okay,
i
object
to
the
regional
director's
determination.
do
you
have
an
opportunity
to
say,
and,
in
particular,
the
finding
that
justice
ginsburg
just
read
was
clearly
erroneous?
unknown
speaker
you
have
the
opportunity
to
say
that?
unknown
speaker
is
the
answer
to
my
question,
then,
no?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
so
the
first
opportunity
you
had
to
make
a
specific
claim
that
this
was
clearly
erroneous
was
before
the
circuit?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
an
opportunity
to
make
a
specific
objection
with
respect
to
the
specific
finding
that
it
is
clearly
erroneous?
unknown
speaker
okay,
and
you
did
not
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
regardless
of
who
did
it,
was
it
done
before--
unknown
speaker
--well,
let's
get
into
how
this
practice
works.
the
evidentiary
hearing
is
before
the
regional
director,
or
before
an
alj?
unknown
speaker
before
a
hearing
officer.
unknown
speaker
and
he
makes
findings.
unknown
speaker
and
then
what
happens?
unknown
speaker
and
then,
if
that
is
unsatisfactory
to
a
party,
the
party
has
a
right
to
appeal
it
to
the
nlrb?
unknown
speaker
okay,
but...
so
you're
dissatisfied
with
the
regional
director's
finding.
does
that
go
automatically
to
the
board,
without
any
submission
on
your
part?
unknown
speaker
so
there's
no
way
that
you
can
ask
the
nlrb
to
change
the
finding
of
the
regional
director?
unknown
speaker
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
where?
unknown
speaker
but
you
opposed
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
against
you
for
refusal
to
bargain,
are
you
limited
to
the
evidence
that
was
adduced
originally?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
de
novo
proceeding.
you
can
bring
in
new
evidence
about--
unknown
speaker
--oh,
you
are
stuck
with
that.
that's
what
i
was
asking.
unknown
speaker
you
are
stuck
with
that
record?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
in
answer
to
the
board's
complaint
you
can
assert
as
a
defense
one
of
the
findings
of
fact
was
clearly
erroneous,
can't
you?
unknown
speaker
and
you
did
do
that
before
the
board?
unknown
speaker
you
did,
in
your
answer
to
the
complaint
before
the
board,
on
the
refusal
to
bargain,
you
did
make
the
point
that
this
finding
of
fact
was
clearly
erroneous.
unknown
speaker
on
what
did
you
base--
--and
did
they
rule
on
that?
unknown
speaker
but
they
did
not
make
a
ruling
specifically--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
hawkins,
could
you
please
tell
me
on
what
basis
you
urged
it
was
clearly
erroneous,
because
i
went
back
to
read
mr.
eichol's
testimony,
and
it
corroborates
what
the
regional
director
reported
exactly.
he
said
that
the
only
authority
that
they
had
as
building
supervisor
was
to
call
employees,
and
they
could
use
a
list
of
employees
who
live
nearby,
the
building
supervisor
had
no
authority
to
compel...
mr.
eichol's
testimony
is
perfectly
consistent
with
what
the
regional
director
found.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that...
that's
not
in
the...
where
is
it
in
the
joint
appendix?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
joint
appendix?
unknown
speaker
everything
that
i
read
in
the
joint
appendix
is
consistent
with
what
the
regional
director
reported.
unknown
speaker
i
would
like
to
know
specifically,
what--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
hawkins,
a
statement
was
made
that
she
has
no
authority
to
order
anyone
to
stay,
that
yes,
she
can
write
somebody
up,
but
anybody
else
can
write
anybody
up.
is
there
any...
anything
that
contradicts
the
statement
that...
what
was
the
expression
that
was
used,
that
it
was
just
to
count,
to
make
sure
that
the
count
was
met,
and
that
she
could
ask
people
to
stay,
if
they
said
no,
she
had
no
authority
to
compel
them
to
stay,
she
got
not
one
penny
extra
for
that
building
supervision--
unknown
speaker
--if
a
person
said
no,
then
what
happened?
unknown
speaker
but
where
is
it
that
says
that
somebody
is
obliged
to
say
yes
to
the
request
for
overtime?
i
didn't
find
that.
unknown
speaker
with
what
request?
unknown
speaker
we're
talking
about
a
legal
definition.
we're
not
talking
about
who
you
can
call
a
supervisor
or
not.
call
anyone
you
want.
and
i
didn't
know
until
you
started,
which
is
why
i
was
asking,
that
there
were
any
facts
in
dispute
in
this
case.
i
thought,
when
i
read
the
sixth
circuit,
that
it
was
perfectly
consistent
with
what
the
alj
had
found,
and
i
thought
the
key
facts
are
that
krcc
directs
that
the
registered
nurses,
1)
may
direct
the
lpn
in
dispensing
medicine.
i
didn't
think
that
was
in
dispute.
i
thought
that,
2)
they
regularly
serve
as
the
highest
ranking
employees
in
the
building.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
3)
they
seek
additional
employees
in
the
event
of
a
staffing
shortage,
all
right.
unknown
speaker
and
i
thought
that
they
move
employees
between
units
as
needed.
that
i
better
put
a
question
mark
on,
but
i
suppose
if
i
read
that
carefully
in
the
alj
i'll
find
they
have
some
authority
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
and
they
have
the
authority
to
write
up
employees
who
do
not
cooperate
with
staffing
assignments.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now,
i
didn't
know
that
there
is
a
factual
dispute.
unknown
speaker
why
is
it
substantial
evidence?
i
thought
that
the
issue
is
whether
the
legal
label
called
supervising
can
fit
on
those
facts,
as
the
record
will
support
them,
i
imagine
to
some
extent,
and
so
we're
dealing
with
a
question
of
law,
and
normally
you'd
say
it's...
on
that
kind
of
a
question
we'd
give
a
lot
of
deference
to
the
board.
unknown
speaker
but
here,
you
wanted...
the
sixth
circuit
said,
the
board
does
not
have
the
legal
power
to
say
that
the
other
side
has
the
burden
of
proof,
namely
you.
they
didn't
have
that
legal
power,
and
the
other
thing
they
said
was
that
they
have
been
saying
certain
things
in
the
past,
mouthing
a
standard
but
doing
something
the
opposite,
so
we're
not
going
to
give
them
as
much
attention
as
normal.
unknown
speaker
is
that...
am
i
right?
what
are
we--
unknown
speaker
--i'm
trying
to
get
what
our
issue
is
here.
unknown
speaker
obviously
not--
unknown
speaker
--but
the
classic
case
was
the
case
of
the
newsboys,
wasn't
it...
they
were
called
newsboys
at
that
time...
are
they
employees,
or
are
they
supervisors,
and
i
believe
that
this
court
in
that
first
case
said
that
the
board
gets
a
lot
of
deference
because
they
know
about
these
things,
and
we
don't.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
a
lot
of
them--
unknown
speaker
--you
mean
you're
saying
we
shouldn't
give
deference
to
the
board
on
such
a
question?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
board's
definition?
unknown
speaker
is
that
found
in
the
briefs
somewhere?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hawkins,
then
every
professional
employee
would
be
excluded,
because
everything
that
you've
read
to
me
is
what
professional
employees
do.
unknown
speaker
the
typical
thing,
i
thought,
that
the
rn
who
says
to
the
lpn,
do
this
injection,
and
supervises
that
process.
i
thought
that
that
would
fall
within
the
definition
of
professional
employee,
but
not
supervisor.
unknown
speaker
there,
the
board
was
trying
to
have
some
special
definition
just
for
nurses
and
health
care
people.
now,
as
i
understand
it,
they're
saying,
we're
not
creating
any
different
definition
for
nurses
than
any
other
professional
employee.
we're
trying
to
distinguish
between
professional
employees
on
the
one
hand,
and
supervisors
on
the
other.
unknown
speaker
can
i
come
back
to
the
facts
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
is
it
really
uncontested
that
the
building
supervisor
had
the
ability
to,
as
one
of
these
memos
say,
if
necessary,
pull
from
one
unit
to
another.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
they
had.
is
that
conceded?
i
thought
that
the
accuracy
of
these
memoranda
as
a
description
of
what
their
genuine
authority
was,
was
contested
by
the
board.
they
said
these
memoranda
is
just
words
on
paper,
and
that's
in
fact
not
how
it
worked.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
okay.
i
mean,
you
can
introduce...
basis
for...
so
on,
right.
the
point
still
remains,
did
they
reflect
the
actual
duties
of
the,
responsibilities
of
the
building
supervisor,
and
the
board
said
that
in
fact
they
didn't.
isn't
that
what
the
board
said?
unknown
speaker
okay.
now,
how
can
we
say
that
that
was
wrong?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
evidence
do
you
have
that
it
did
represent--
unknown
speaker
--well,
maybe
the
burden's
on
them,
i
guess.
it
is
a
memoranda
that
goes
to
all
nurses.
they
don't
deny
that
it
went
to
all
nurses.
unknown
speaker
and
they...
but
they're
just
saying,
it
never
happened?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
just
concerns
being
short
on
night
shift,
and
that
is
really
just
a
mathematical
call.
that
doesn't
take
any
independent
judgment
there.
you're
supposed
to
have
30
people
there,
we
have
only
29,
pick
up
the
phone
and
see
if
you
can
get
a
thirtieth
in.
that's
just
not
independent
judgment.
unknown
speaker
she
wasn't
given
that
discretion.
as
i
understood
it,
she
had
to
make
the
call
when
they
were
understaffed.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
that,
no
restriction
on...
yeah,
she
was
supposed
to
try
to
get
them
up
to
the
full
count,
and
to
call
people,
but
where
is
there--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
see
how
to
deal
with
the
case
unless
we're
like
a
super-nlrb,
unless...
i
could
go
this
far,
we
take
the
facts
as
stated
in
the
sixth
circuit,
you
know,
and
we
say
that
insofar
as
those
are
conclusory,
what
they
actually
mean,
as
long
as
it
allows
it,
is
what
the
board
said.
i
mean,
we'd
go
back
to
the
opinions
of
the
board,
which
i
agree
is
just
a
summary
affirmance,
so
you'd
go
back
to
the
opinions
of
the
district
director
and
say
that's
what
the
words
mean,
so
when
they
talk
about
it,
you
know,
when
they
talk
about
her
super...
how...
unless
you
want
us
to
go...
you're
saying
we
should
go
read
through
the
whole
record
and
decide
whether
all
these--
unknown
speaker
--well,
and
you
say
it
was
her
judgment
as
to
how
many
of
the
extant
employees
would
be
in
each
of
the
various
units.
she
said,
you
know,
we
need
eight
here,
rather
than
just
five,
so
i'm
going
to
pull
three
from
the
next-door
units.
she
could
do
that.
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
everybody's
there,
the
full
complement
of
the
staff
is
there,
and
you
say
she
had
authority
to
say,
we
need
more
in
this
unit
than
they
need
in
the
other
unit.
unknown
speaker
i'm
going
to
transfer
three
people
to
this
unit.
unknown
speaker
and
that,
and
the
evidence
for
that
is
the
memorandum
which
says,
if
necessary,
pull
from
one
unit
to
another.
unknown
speaker
well,
could
you
give
us
an
example
of
what
those
citations...
is
that
the
testimony
of
a
witness
that
you're
referring
to?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
talking
about
calling
people
in.
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
i'm
talking
about
assigning
the
employees
that
are
there
and
saying,
i
am
going
to
make
the
independent
judgment
that
we
should
have
more
people
in
this
unit
than
the
employer
originally
put
there,
because
this
unit
has
special
needs
today,
and
i
am
making
that
judgment,
three
people
come
from
this
unit
and
go
here.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
evidence
is
there
for
that,
beyond
the
statement
in
the
memorandum?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--let
me
ask
one
question.
you've
given
us
so
much
detail
it's
really
kind
of
hard
to
follow
the
argument.
am
i
correct
in
assuming
that
the
factual
basis
for
your
position
is
entirely
found
on
page
18a
and
19a
of
the
appendix
to
the
cert
petition?
that's
what
the
sixth
circuit
relied
on,
as
i
understood
it.
unknown
speaker
and
so
you
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
call
our
attention
to
any
other
facts
than
those
that
the
sixth
circuit
relied
on?
unknown
speaker
they
have
said,
though,
that
these
facts
are
sufficient
to
establish
their
status
as
supervisors.
unknown
speaker
and
so
either...
it
seems
to
me
you
either
agree
or
disagree
with
what
they
say
on
that
page.
unknown
speaker
your
six
points
on
what's
the
correct...
are
they
in
your
brief,
because
i'd
like
to--
unknown
speaker
--what
rn
under
those
standards...
what
rn
would
ever
be
professional
and
not
supervisory?
unknown
speaker
well,
typically
isn't
it
so
in
hospitals
nowadays
that
you
have
a
lot
of
subpeople
under...
who
are
not
rn's
but
are
lpn's,
and
then
other
categories,
and
that
the
nurse
on
the
shift
would
be
telling
those
people...
she
wouldn't
be
the
nurse
in
charge
of
assigning
anybody
any
place,
but
she
certainly
would
be
directing
the
nurse's
aides
and
the
lpn's.
unknown
speaker
i
asked
you
to
tell
me
who,
under
your
definition,
what
nurse,
assuming
that
the
nurse
is
going
to
give
instructions
to
an
lpn,
to
a
nurse's
aide,
and
to
other
people
who
work
in
the
hospital,
what
nurse
would
not
fit
the
standards
that
you
just
read?
unknown
speaker
what
nurse
in
any
hospital
setup
would
not
have
the
authority
to
direct
the
lpn,
supervise
the
lpn
in
the
way
a
treatment
is
administered,
a
treatment
ordered
by
a
doctor?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
hawkins.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
you
have
6
minutes
remaining.
mr.
wallace,
i
hope
at
some
point
in
your
6
minutes
you'll
tell
us
on
what
basis
the
board
disregarded
and
apparently
didn't
accept
the
truth
of
the
memorandum
which
said
that
these
nurses
had
authority,
if
necessary,
to
pull
from
one
unit
to
another.
unknown
speaker
what
does
that
prove?
unknown
speaker
the
sixth
circuit
did
say
that,
in
its
opinion,
that
they
have
the
authority
to
move
employees
between
units
as
needed,
and
i
don't
think
the
board
said
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you...
mr.
wallace,
do
you
challenge
the
sixth
circuit's...
you
say
the
sixth...
you
agree
the
sixth
circuit
said
there
was
the
authority
to
move.
now,
do
you
challenge
that
finding?
unknown
speaker
you
can
answer
that
yes
or
no.
try,
anyway.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
the
memos
in
the
record,
and
to
follow
up
on
justice
scalia's
question,
you
say
that
a
nurse,
one
nurse
testified
she
had
read
only
one
of
the
two
memos.
was
there
other...
what
was
the
other
factual
basis
for
the
board
saying
these
memos
were
not
accurate,
or
were
not
used?
unknown
speaker
what
was
his
authority
for
saying
that?
i
mean,
what
was
the
testimony,
or
reason
that
he
said
that?
unknown
speaker
can
i
take
it
as
some
concession
on
this?
the
sixth
circuit
says,
they
have,
the
registered
nurse
has
authority
to,
quote,
move
employees
between
units
as
needed.
in
respect
to
that...
that's
the
only
one
that
wasn't
there
before.
in
respect
to
that,
you
say
on
page
16
of
your
brief,
the
building
supervisors,
namely
the
nurses
here,
transfer
employees
from
one
unit
to
another
simply,
quote,
to
make
sure
the
head
count
is
there,
end
quote.
unknown
speaker
so
i
don't
really
see
the
conflict.
unknown
speaker
so
they
do
have
authority
to
move
people
to
make
sure
the
head
count
is--
--well,
wait,
i
don't
understand
that.
as
needed
means
to
make
sure
the
head
count
is
there.
they
have
a
full
complement
of
people.
how...
if
you're
short-staffed,
moving
it
to
another
unit
can't
increase
the
head
count.
i
mean,
it
clearly
means
in
that
memorandum
that
they
can
decide
they
need
more
in
one
unit
than
are
assigned
to
that
unit
normally.
doesn't
it
clearly
mean
that?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
unknown
speaker
the
opinion
of
the
court
