justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
respondent
kentucky
river
community
care,
incorporated
operates
a
residential
care
facility
in
pippa
passes,
kentucky
where
it
employs
approximately
110
professional
and
non-professional
employees
including
six
registered
nurses.
this
case
arose
when
the
kentucky
state
district
council
of
carpenters,
a
labor
union,
sought
to
represent
a
bargaining
unit
of
respondent’s
employees,
and
respondent
appose
the
inclusion
within
that
bargaining
unit
of
its
nurses.
respondent
argued
that
the
nurses
were
supervisors
under
section
2(11)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
if
true,
that
would
permit
respondent
to
insist
that
the
nurses
be
excluded
from
the
bargaining
unit.
the
national
labor
relations
board’s
regional
director
held
a
representation
hearing
to
settle
the
dispute
between
respondent
and
the
union
concerning
representation.
at
that
hearing
the
regional
director
placed
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
nurses
were
supervisors
upon
respondent.
it
then
found
that
respondent
had
not
met
its
burden
and
included
the
nurses
in
the
unit.
respondent
refuse
to
bargain
with
the
union
prompting
the
board’s
general
counsel
to
file
an
unfair
labor
practice
complaint
which
is
the
usual
way
to
obtain
judicial
review
of
the
representation
decision.
the
board
granted
the
general
counsel
summary
judgment
on
the
basis
of
the
regional
director’s
representation
decision,
but
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
refused
to
enforce
the
board’s
order.
we
granted
certiorari
to
decide
two
issues:
first,
we
must
decide
which
party,
respondent
or
the
board,
carries
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
nurses
are
or
are
not
supervisors
under
section
2(11)
of
the
act.
the
act
itself
does
not
expressly
allocate
the
burden
of
proving
supervisory
status
but
the
board
has
consistently
placed
that
burden
on
the
party
claiming
that
the
employee
is
a
supervisor,
and
sometimes
that
will
be
the
employer,
sometimes
that
will
be
the
union.
we
find
that
rule
to
be
reasonable
and
consistent
with
the
act
and
so
we
defer
to
it.
as
applied
to
this
case,
the
rule
dictates
that
“respondent
who
is
seeking
to
exclude
its
nurses
from
a
bargaining
unit
because
they
are
supervisors
must
bear
the
burden
of
proving
that”.
the
sixth
circuit
therefore
erred
when
it
placed
the
burden
on
the
board.
the
second
issue
we
address
is
whether
the
board’s
interpretation
of
the
statutory
test
for
supervisory
status
is
reasonable
and
consistent
with
the
act.
the
act
deems
employees
to
be
supervisors
if
they
satisfy
three
criteria:
first,
they
must
exercise
one
of
twelve
listed
supervisory
functions,
one
of
which
is
“responsibly
directing”
other
employees;
second,
they
must
use
“independent
judgment”
in
exercising
that
authority;
and
third,
they
must
“exercise
their
authority
in
the
employer’s
interest”.
the
board
rejected
respondent’s
proof
that
its
nurses
were
supervisors
on
the
ground
that
employees
do
not
use
independent
judgment
and
hence
fail
to
meet
the
second
criterion,
when
they
exercise
“ordinary
professional
or
technical
judgment
in
directing
less
skilled
employees
to
deliver
services
in
accordance
with
employer
specified
standards”.
there
are
several
elements
to
this
interpretation
by
the
board,
and
we
find
that
while
some
of
them
are
permissible,
others
are
not.
the
text
of
section
2(11)
which
requires
that
the
exercise
of
supervisory
authority
“not
be
of
a
merely
routine
or
clerical
nature,
but
require
the
use
of
independent
judgment”,
introduces
questions
regarding
the
degree
of
judgment
that
is
sufficient
to
make
one
a
supervisor.
the
board
by
declaring
that
ordinary
judgment
is
not
enough
permissibly
interprets
this
ambiguity
regarding
degree.
in
addition,
by
recognizing
that
some
tasks
are
performed
in
accordance
with
employer
specified
standards,
the
board
properly
finds
that
orders
issued
by
an
employer
can
reduce
the
degree
of
judgment
ordinarily
required
to
perform
a
task
below
the
statutory
threshold
for
supervisory
status.
the
board
also
however,
relies
on
factors
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
degree
of
discretion
and
employee
exercises,
and
that
is
where
it
parts
company
with
the
text
of
the
statute.
under
the
board’s
interpretation,
even
a
significant
judgment
that
is
only
loosely
constrained
by
the
employer,
will
fail
to
be
independent
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
if
it
is
a
“professional
or
technical”
judgment.
this
is
a
distinction
in
kind
that
the
statute
does
not
permit.
similarly,
the
board’s
application
of
this
distinction
to
only
one
of
the
twelve
listed
supervisory
functions,
namely
the
function
of
responsibly
directing
other
employees
also
contradicts
the
text
of
the
statute.
since
we
do
not
find
persuades
of
the
board’s
contention
that
congress
incorporated
its
interpretation
of
independent
judgment
when
congress
amended
the
act
in
1947,
we
hold
the
board’s
interpretation
impermissible.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justices
sutter,
ginsburg
and
breyer
have
joined.
