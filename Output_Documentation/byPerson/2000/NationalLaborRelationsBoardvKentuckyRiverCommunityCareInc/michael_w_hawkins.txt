mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
must
reject
the
board's
interpretation
of
independent
judgment
and
the
definition
of
supervisory
status
in
this
case
in
order
to
assure
americans
throughout
this
country
that
when
they
put
their
loved
ones
in
nursing
homes,
health
care
facilities,
and
home
care
facilities
such
as
our
client,
that
they
are
assured
of
an
environment
which
will
be
supervised
and
well-managed.
no
one
in
this
room,
or
this
country,
would
put
themselves
or
their
family
or
loved
ones
into
a
nursing
home
or
health
care
facility
where,
unknowing
to
them,
there
was
no
one
in
supervision
for
72
to
75
percent
of
the
time.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
building
supervisor,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
well,
your
honor,
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
regional
director
must
have
read
some
different
record,
because
he
didn't
read
the
record
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
that
is
completely
erroneous.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
we
raised
it
in--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--they
take
the
position
that
they
take,
and
that
they're
right.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
well--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--the
board
gave
the
rhetoric
that
it
gave
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
no,
they
did
not
find...
the
board
did
not
find
it
erroneous,
but
the
sixth
circuit
did.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
the
sixth
circuit
did.
the
board
did
not
address
it.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
your
honor,
the
way
this
process
works,
this
was
our
case
hearing,
and
what
ends
up
taking
place
is,
it
goes
to
the
board,
and
then
they
issue
a
complaint
for
summary
judgment
for
the
employer's
refusal
to
bargain,
so
you
don't
have
a
full,
adjudicative
burden
of
proof,
burden
of
evidence
hearing
before
the
nlrb
itself.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
well,
the
employer
in
this
case
raised
an
objection
to
the
regional
director's
decision.
that
was
just
rubberstamped
by
the
nlrb.
we
appealed
to
the--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--well,
what
i'm
getting
at,
your
honor,
is
that
there
is
not
a
formal
determination
by
the
board.
it
is
a,
we
reviewed
it,
we
agree
with
the
regional
director,
the
employer
technically
refuses
to
bargain
to
get
this
issue
before
the
sixth
circuit,
and
that's
what
this
employer
did
in
that
situation.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
so...
it's
an...
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
other
than
raising
the
issue
about
the
board's
regional
director's
determination.
you
raise
it
with
the
board,
the
nlrb--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--in
the--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--in
odd
case
situation,
which
this
arises
out
of,
the
employer's
ability
to
challenge
it
is
by
refusing
to
bargain.
the
nlrb--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--the
answer
to
your
question
is
no.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
you
do
not
have
a
formal
process
to
resolve
it
before
the
board.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
no,
your
honor.
you
have
the
ability
to
raise
the
erroneous
nature
of
it
before
the
board,
but
you
do
not
get
a
hearing
before
the
board.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
yes,
you
do,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
no,
that
was
done,
to
my
understanding.
i
did
not
handle
the
case
at
the
board
level.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
to
my
knowledge,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
it's...
no,
it's
not
before
an
al...
it's
before
a
hearing
officer--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--of
that
particular
region.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
yes.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
and
then
the...
well,
he
doesn't
make
findings.
he
apparently
makes
some
recommendations
to
the
regional
director,
and
the
regional
director
writes
up
a
report
based
on
those
recommendations.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
it's
not
really
an
appeal.
you
raise
your
objections
about
that
determination,
i.e.,
in
this
case
that
these
individuals
were
supervisors,
as
opposed
to
were
not
supervisors.
that
process
then
ends
up
forcing
an
election.
you
don't
have
a
choice
about
it.
they
hold--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--no.
you...
they
order
an
election
and
schedule
an
election.
you're
stuck
with
that
process.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
not
in
that
process,
no.
they
direct
an
election,
the
regional
director
directs
an
election,
and...
he
has
an
election.
the
way
you
challenge
that
issue
is
by
refusing
to
bargain
and
they
end
up
filing
a
technical
8(a)(5)
charge
against
the
employer,
the
employer
refuses
to
bargain,
and
then
if
your
way
of...
they
file
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--the
nlrb
general
counsel
files
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
with
the
nlrb,
and
the
nlrb...
i
mean,
every
case,
our
case
i've
had,
they
end
up
granting
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
yes,
i
did,
in
the
lower
level.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
well,
you
don't
have
a
new
hearing.
you're
stuck
with
the
record.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
yes,
you
are
stuck
with
the
record.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
correct,
and...
so
the
way
in
which
you
get
review
of
it
by
a
court
is
with
the
refusal
to
bargain,
and
then
you
end
up
with--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--yes,
and
the
sixth
circuit
so
agreed
that
they
were
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
they
grant
summary
judgment.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
they
don't
issue
you
a
formal
decision
and
write-up,
and
we
find
this,
and
we
find
that.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
your
honor,
i
believe
this
court's
standard
is
the
record
as
a
whole,
and
it's
not
on
one
particular
page
of
a
transcript.
if
you
look
at
the
record
as
a
whole--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--where's
what
in
the
joint
appendix?
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
yes--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--well,
your
honor,
if
i
may
i'll
be
glad
to
point
out
some
things
to
you.
some
11
times
in
the
transcript,
in
the
administrator's
testimony
from
transcript
138
to
221
he
references
responsible
or
responsibility
11
different
times.
he
talks
about
judgment,
or
judgment
calls--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--okay.
pages
140--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--your
honor,
there's
nothing
in
section
211
that
talks
about
pay
being
an
issue.
i
would
submit
to
you
at
j.a....
joint
appendix
62,
63,
and
64,
which
are
the
three
memos
in
question,
and
if
you
take
all
of
mr.
eichol's
testimony
in
total,
you
will
find
that
these
individuals
clearly
had
supervisory
authority,
and
clearly
had
authority
under
211
that
surpassed
and
was
not
routine,
and
much
more
significant
than
anybody
else
in
that
building
during
the
time
that
they
supervised.
they
had
the
ability
to
call
in
people
for
overtime,
and
even
the
hearing
officer--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--according
to
the
memo,
they
have
the
authority
to
write
them
up,
and
i
know
the
regional
director
made
a
to-do,
well,
they
didn't
write
anybody
up,
but
that
assumes
that
all
your
employees
must
totally
disrespect
you
as
a
supervisor,
and
that
you
have
to
be
writing
everybody
up.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
well,
it
says
in
the
j.a.
63,
please
write
up
anyone
who
does
not
comply
with
the
request
immediately.
there
was
also
testimony--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--the
request
to
work,
or
to
cover
the
unit,
or
to
pull
someone
from
one
unit
to
another,
and
so
therefore,
if...
it
was
also
testified
that...
and
it's
in
the
record,
that
every
employee
in
the
facility
had
to
sign
all
three
of
these
memoranda,
read
them,
to
acknowledge...
i
mean,
a
company
and
an
employer
cannot
do
anything
more
significant
and
more
strongly
to
communicate
to
every
one
of
their
employees,
this
person
is
the
supervisor,
they
are
in
charge
of
the
building
and
you
will
follow
their
lead,
to
the
point
that--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
i'm
not
disputing
those
facts.
i
guess
really
more
what
the
issue,
then,
is,
is
the
substantial
evidence
issue,
and
that's--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--unless
there--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--well,
your
honor,
if
we
look
at
these--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--well,
you
certainly--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--this
court
in
chevron
and
a
number
of
the
other
cases
said
you
certainly
do
not
give
the
board
deference
when
their
interpretation
of
the
act
and
application
of
it
is
irrational--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--and
is
not
consistent
with
the
law.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
this
court
in
hcr
and
yeshiva,
and
bell--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--all
these
cases,
is
not
giving
deference
to
the
board.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
no,
you
should
not
give
deference
to
the
board
in
this
case
because
their
interpretation
of
this
particular
statute
is
so
irrational
and
so
inconsistent
with
the
act.
in
fact,
addressing
justice
scalia's
point
earlier,
you
raised
the
question,
justice,
about
this
issue
of
responsibly
direction,
the
board
go
back,
and
come
back,
is
that
going
to
be
the
next
one
we're
going
to
have.
if
you
read
the
definition
that
they
have
of
independent
judgment,
and
i
would
really
address
this
and
tell
the...
suggest
to
the
court
that
you
pay
attention
to
this...
the
board
continues
with
employers
to
not
be
proactive.
they
just
keep
telling
employers
what
it's
not.
it's
a
shell
game.
what
it's...
they
never
say...
if
i
read
through
the
enter
carpenter's
brief
you
can't
find
where
they
say
what
independent
judgment
is.
they
keep
saying
what
it's
not.
but
in
looking
at
their
definition
of
it,
and
if
you
stack
that
up
against
senator
flanders'
comparison
of
what
responsibly
direct
is,
they
have
literally
written
out
of
the
act,
responsibly
direct.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
the
board's
definition--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--yes.
they
set
it
forth
in
the
petition
for
cert,
item
number
1
and
index
1,
which
is
the
reverse
of,
it's
not
independent
judgment
if
an
rn
exercises
ordinary
professional
technical
judgment
in
directing
less-skilled
employees
to
deliver
services
in
accordance
with
employer's
specified
standards.
well,
what
did
senator
flanders
say
in
the...
at
pages
14
and
15
of
our
brief,
what
did
senator
flanders
say
was
responsibly
direct?
guess
what?
he
said,
it's
exercise
personal
judgment
based
on
personal
experience,
training,
and
abilities.
he
says,
it's
the
direction
of
a
department
and
the
men
under
him,
the
less-skilled
people.
he
says
he
determines
under
general
orders
what
to
do,
and
he
gives
instructions
for
its
proper
performance.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
no,
i
disagree,
your
honor,
and
let
me
explain
why.
if
you
look
at
what
senator
flanders
was
talking
about
as
to
the
definition
of
responsibly
direct,
he's
hit
all
of
these
points.
he
has
hit
the
fact
that
you
exercise
personal
judgment
based
on
your
skill
and
training,
i.e.,
a
professional.
he
has
hit...
this
is
not
what
all
professionals
do,
direct
their
men
under
them,
do
it
pursuant
to
general
orders
of
the
employer,
and
gives
instructions
for
its
proper
adoption.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
well,
your
honor,
i'm
aware
of
the
concern
and
the
dissent
that
you
wrote
in
hcr
about
this
issue
concerning
when
is
someone--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--and
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
they
have
not
done
that.
in
fact,
all
they've
done
is,
in
different
terms,
defined
professional.
if
you
look
at
their
definition
of
independent
judgment,
and
if
you
took
it
and
put
it
up
on
a
board
next
to
definition
of
supervisor
and
definition
of
professional,
and
said,
which
one
does
this
fit,
you'd
say,
it
fits
professional.
their
definition
of
independent
judgment
is
a
professional.
that's
why
it's
wrong,
and
that's
why
it's
inconsistent
with
the
act.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
they
had
the
ability
to
do
that.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
your
honor,
those
memoranda
were
introduced
without
objection.
in
fact,
it
was...
when
they
were
introduced--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--well,
they
may...
yes,
they
did
say
that
they
didn't.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
on
the
substantial
evidence
standard.
this
court--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--i'll
give
you
a
few
examples,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
and
they
don't
deny
that
all
the
board
signed
for
it.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
no,
your
honor,
they're
not
saying
those
different
things
did
not
happen.
let
me
go
through
a
few
of
these
points
in
the
record,
and
these
are
some
questions
that
were
posed
by
the
hearing
officer
herself
in
this
case.
in
the
record,
it's
very
clear
that
there
typically
was
oftentimes
one
individual
on
duty.
there
was
one
question
at
j.a.
36
where
the
administrator
was
asked,
even
if
you're
on
duty,
say,
beyond
3:00
and
this
building
supervisor
is
there,
what
ends
up
happening,
and
would
you
handle
it?
he
says,
no.
in
other
words,
if
i'm
in
the
building,
i
would,
you
know,
be
surprised
if
they
came
to
me
and
said,
looks
like
we're
going
to
be
a
little
short
on
night
shift,
what
do
you
think
we
should
do?
in
other
words,
the
question
is
going
to
be
asked
of
the
building
supervisor,
not
me,
the
administrator.
she's
in
charge
of
that
issue.
that's
as
strong
a
granting
of
the
right
to
independent
judgment
and
section
211
duties
as
any.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
your
honor,
if
you
apply
that
principle,
then
the
vast
array
of
supervisors
throughout
the
united
states
are
not
going
to
be
supervisors,
because
i
believe,
as
mr.
chief
justice
indicated,
it's
very
frequently
the
exact
situation,
where
management
tells
you,
these
are
how
many
people
are
allocated
to
your
department,
you're
going
to
get
the
job
done,
if
enough
people
don't
show
up,
call
people
in,
hold
people
over
for
overtime...
that
is
an
inherent
part
of
supervision,
making
those
judgments.
we
can
get
the
production
out
today
with
less
people,
so
i
won't
call
anybody
in.
no,
we
can't
get
the
production
out
today,
we
need
to
call
someone
in.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
your
honor,
at
page,
transcript
206,
concerning
overtime
without
restriction,
the
question
by
the
hearing
officer
again
was,
so
is
there
no
restriction
on
that
concerning
overtime
assignment
and
calling
people
in,
and
the
answer
was
no.
even
a
question
at
transcript--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--but
there's
no...
the
point
there

one
of
the
residence
assistants
says,
yeah,
i've
been
asked
to
stay
over
and
called
in
a
lot,
so
she
clearly
had
those
responsibilities.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
that
you
have
to
go
read
through
the
whole
record.
i'm
saying
that,
absent
showing
that
the
sixth
circuit
was
in
some
way
arbitrary
and
capricious
about
the
way
in
which
they
handled
this
matter,
they
should
be
affirmed.
the
other
point
i
would
make,
and
i
would
like
to
propose,
and
i've
been
doing
this
work
for
some
25
years,
and
not
unlike
what
this
court
did
in
ellerith
&
ferriger,
it
provided
good
determinative
standards
for
employers
to
follow
to
be
able
to
comply
with
the
law,
to
define
in
this
situation
what
is
a
supervisor,
and
i'd
like
to
propose
six
points
for
this
court
that
i
think
address
these
issues.
one
is
that
the
individual
in
question
should
have
the
authority
from
their
employer
to
engage
in
one
of
the
twelve
activities.
in
our
case,
they
had
the
authority
to
assign,
transfer,
and
responsibly
direct
the
employees
by
those
definitions.
two,
the
individual
should
be
responsible
for
other
employees,
a
shift,
a
department,
a
unit,
a
facility.
in
our
case,
the
rn
was
in
charge
of
the
building
and
the
shift,
and
of
the
residents,
and
the
facility
in
general.
senator
flanders
talks
about
that
in
terms
of
direction
of
department,
men
under
him.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
if
the
census
was
down
in
a
particular
period
of
time,
if
it
was
up
she
had
those
sorts
of
abilities.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
yes,
she
did.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
yes,
she
did,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
it's
more
than
that,
your
honor.

mr.

w.
hawkins
--these
are
testimony
of
various
witnesses
about
being
assigned,
calling
people
in,

and
that

employees
are
needed.
building
supervisors
can
situationally
ask
for
an
increase.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
i'd
also
like
to
address--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--yes,
your
honor,
we
rely
on
what
the
sixth
circuit--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--well,
i
do
to
the
extent
the
board's
wanting
to
say
these
people
aren't
engaged
in
independent
judgment,
because
i
think
these--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--right.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
with
the
sixth
circuit,
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
no,
they're
not,
your
honor,
and
i'd
like
to
finish
those
quickly.
the
fourth
one
is
the
authority
they
have
in
exercise
under
section
211
is
different
from
those
they
supervise
and
thus
not
routine,
and
i
think
that
addresses
the
routine
issue.
it
also
addresses
yeshiva
at
690
about
it
not
being
routine,
and
when
you
look
at
the
totality
of
the
activities
that
these
rn's
are
engaged
in,
they're
not
routine
as
compared
to
the
others
they
supervise.
fifth,
that
the
authority
to
exercise
does
not
consist
only
of
record-keeping
or
filing,
and
thus
not
clerical,
and
sixth,
in
exercising
their
authority
they
are
not
subordinate
to
those
that
they
supervise,
and
use
their
personal
judgment
based
upon
experience,
training,
and
ability,
thus
they
use
independent
judgment,
and
these
standards
are
rational,
they're
reasonable,
they
alleviate
any
concern
that
we're
trying
to
suggest
that
all
professionals
are
supervisors,
or
that
somehow
or
another--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--well,
certainly
in
large
health
care
facilities
you'll
have
a
floor
in
a
hospital,
as
an
example,
where
everybody's
an
rn,
and
you'll
have
one
unit
supervisor.
you
wouldn't
say
all
of
those
rn's,
just
because
they
simply
periodically
tell
another
nurse
aide
or
lpn,
oh,
adjust
this--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--well,
your
honor,
if
the
rn
is
directing
the
facility,
as
this
one
was
in
this
situation,
they
would
be
a
supervisor.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
a
nurse
that
doesn't
have
the
authority
from
the
employer
to
direct
those
employees.
a
nurse
that's
not
been
told
you're
in
charge
of
the
unit.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
your
honor,
as
an
example,
in
some
of
the
other
cases
that
this
court
has
dealt
with
you
talked
about
whether
the
individual
is
aligned
with
management
or
not.
that
is
a
key
component.
is
a
nurse
just
performing
her
duties
in
a
project
sort
of
the
straw-boss
lead
person,
or
are
they
actually
aligned
with
management
and
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
directing
the
facility
or
the
unit
or
the
group
of
individuals.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
the
board
did
not
say
that,
and
that
is
not
my
understanding
of
the
findings.
i
will
say,
i'm
holding
in
my
hand
here
the
response
to
the
general
counsel's
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
before
the
board,
and
there
was
no
effort
to
introduce
any
further
evidence
on
any
of
the
matters
that
we're
talking
about.
the
only
request
to
introduce
further
evidence
was
on
the
question
of
whether
the
employer
was
exempt
from
coverage
because
it
was
an
arm
of
the
state
government,
or
because
its
board
was
controlled
by
public
officials.
