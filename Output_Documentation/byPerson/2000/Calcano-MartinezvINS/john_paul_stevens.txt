justice
john
paul
stevens
could
i
just
interrupt
you
with
one
quick...
do
you
concede
that
a
conviction
prior
to
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
the
statute
is
proper
ground
for
deportation
without
having
an
opportunity
for
discretionary
review?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand,
but
are
you
conceding
convictions
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
statute
have
the
same
legal
effect
as
convictions
after
the
enactment
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
suggestion,
because
justice
kennedy
poses
a
case
that,
you
know,
right
on
the
brink
of
deciding
that
he's
going
to
have
his
earlier
conviction
set
aside.
what
if
he's
just
filed
his
habeas
corpus
petition
in
state
court,
and
it's
going
to...
on
the
docket,
and
it's
going
to
sit
there
for
3
years
before
it's
decided?
would
the
immigration
judge
have
authority
to
say,
i
think
i
want
to
wait
to
see
what
happens
in
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
you,
mr.
kneedler,
with
this
question.
they
are
unquestionably
removable,
and
there's
no
right
to
discretion
if
your
construction
of
the
statute
is
right,
but
sort
of
in
the
background
of
this
case
is
the
question
whether
convictions
obtained
before
the
enactment
of
this
statute
have
the
same
legal
significance
as
convictions
obtained
afterwards,
and
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
the
government's
position
is
there's
no
way
in
which
a
federal
court
can
decide
whether
that's
correct
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
concede
that,
why
couldn't
the
litigants
in
this
case
say,
we
make
that
constitutional
argument
and,
secondly,
we
say
you
should
construe
the
statute
to
avoid
that
constitutional
question,
so
now
we're
in
court...
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
they
did
that,
do
you
think
we
could
then
decide
the
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that's
all
perfectly
clear
with
respect
to
convictions
after
the
statute
is
passed,
but
the
problem
is,
it's
not
quite
as
clear,
as
least,
as
to
convictions
before
the
statute
was
passed,
and
that's
why
we
have
the
problem.
