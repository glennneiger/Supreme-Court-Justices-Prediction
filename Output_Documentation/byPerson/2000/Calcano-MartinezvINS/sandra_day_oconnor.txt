but,
of
course,
the
discretionary
relief
provision
was
changed,
too,
wasn't
it,
and
doesn't
afford
it
now
for
people
convicted
of
this
type
of
crime.

but
this
claim
comes
very
close
to
being
covered
by
the
combination
of
the
heikkila
and
accardi
cases,
which
together
indicate
that
the
constitution
requires
some
kind
of
judicial
review
over
a
claim
that
an
executive
actor
unlawfully
failed
to
exercise
any
discretion.
justice

o'connor
true,
it
didn't
spell
it
out,
but
if
you
look
at
heikkila
and
accardi
together,
there's
some
indication
of
support
for
the
position
of
your
opposing
counsel.
