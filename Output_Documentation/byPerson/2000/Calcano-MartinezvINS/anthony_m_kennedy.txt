justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
there's
a
case
in
which
it's
conceded
that
the
attorney
general
has
discretionary
authority.
before
he
exercises...
and
the
immigration
judge
has
found
that
the
person
is
deportable.
before
the
attorney
general
exercises
that
discretion,
is
there
a
final
order
of
deportation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
do
you
concede
there's
a
final
order
of
deportation
here,
or
do
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
it
seems
to
me
that
may
be
important
under
the
interpretation
of
the
statute.
it
seems
to
me
you
can
argue
that
where,
as
in
your
case,
the
alien
requests
the
attorney
general
to
exercise
the
attorney
general's
discretion,
there
is
no
final
order
of
deportability
until
he
does
so.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
think
there's
a
final
order
under
the
statute,
1252?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
this
is
a
final
order
of
removal
against
an
alien
who
is
removable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
just...
in
just
looking
at
this
statute,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
attorney
general
does
not
give
much
force
to
the
phrase,
who
is
removable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
makes
for
an
awkward
statute,
frankly,
if
you
take
it
out,
but
it's...
i
thought
that
your
argument
might
be
that
this...
your
client
is
not
an
alien
who
is
removable
under
a
final
order.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
saying
that
because
removable
means
a
person
who
is
potentially
deportable,
that
your
client
is
removable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
asking
if
you
could
make
the
argument
that
your
client
is
not
removable
because
the
statute
does
not
prevent
discretion
being
exercised
as
to
him,
you've
asked
for
discretion,
it
hasn't
been
exercised,
so
there
is
no
final
order
against
an
alien
who
is
removable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
did
you
argue...
you
don't
argue
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
under
my
submission,
and
frankly
i
don't
think
this
works,
because
the
statute
is
pretty
awkward
and
because
of
what
you've
already
said
about
removal,
but
under...
if
there
was
some
merit
to
this
interpretation
and
it
could
be
adopted
to
avoid
the
constitutional
problem,
then
the
review
wouldn't
even
be
by
habeas,
it
would
be
just
under
the
review
mechanisms
of
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
don't
seem
to
be
too
happy
with
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
getting
back
to
the
statute,
and
justice
scalia's
question,
the
question
was,
well,
suppose
he
hadn't
committed
a
criminal
offense,
would
that
be
grounds
for
saying
that
the
statute
doesn't
apply?
i
thought
your
answer
would
be
yes,
even
the
government
concedes
that...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
habeas
portion
of
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
again,
does
that
mean
there
is
no
final
order
here,
or
is
it
a
contingent
final
order,
because
this
is
very
important
for
the
statutory
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that...
but
then
justice
souter's
question
is,
suppose
the
discretion
was
just
abused.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
there
then
be
a
final
order?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
just
remind
me,
what
happens
if
a
collateral
attack
is
underway
and
the
justice
department
institutes
deportation
proceedings?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
there
were
a
very
strong
showing
of
deficiency
in
the
conviction,
a
brady
violation,
gideon
violation,
would
the
collateral
review
court
have
the
authority
to
stay
the
deportation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
it
didn't.
would
an
article
iii
court
have
that
authority?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
to
which
court,
the
collateral
review
court
in
the
criminal
proceeding?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
but
i
thought
there
was
no
review...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
kneedler...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
the
court
of
appeals
has
authority
to
stay
the
removal
in
that
case,
why
doesn't
it
have
the
authority
to
stay
the
removal
here,
when
it
says,
i'm
in
a
class
of
persons
to
whom
this
statute
simply
doesn't
apply?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
under
your
reading
the
statute
is
the
same
as
if
who
is
removable
isn't
even
there.
there's
kind
of
a
missing
pronoun.
it's
awkward.
but
you
give
no
effect
to
who
is
removable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
your
position
is,
there's
a
final
order
of
removal
against
an
alien
by
reason
of
having
committed
a
criminal
offense.
that's
your
position,
so
under
your
position
the
who
is
removable
has
no
force.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
have
some
question
about
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
the
chennary
case,
which
i
never
fully
understood,
says
that
if
the
exercise
of
discretion
is
committed
to
an
official,
the
official
must
exercise
that
discretion
in
some
instances.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
give
me
some
authority
for
that
proposition,
either
under
the
statute,
or
under
our
cases?
