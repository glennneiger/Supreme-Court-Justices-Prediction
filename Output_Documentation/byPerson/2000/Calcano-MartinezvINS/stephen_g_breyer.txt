justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
they
mean
by
the
last
step.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
justice
kennedy
started
out
with,
i
thought,
was
that
their
claim
here
is,
there
is
a
section
of
a
new
statute,
and
that
section
doesn't
apply,
because
it
isn't
retroactive.
now,
that's
like
saying,
this
court
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
a
claim
under
that
section
because
it
doesn't
apply.
now,
maybe
they're
right,
maybe
they're
wrong,
but
it
sounds
as
if
they're
making
a
claim
that
is
a
claim
of
jurisdiction,
or
very
similar
to
one,
and
how
do
you
distinguish
that
very
basic
claim
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
because
there
is
no
applicable
law
from
the
claims
that
you
admit
you
could
hear,
which
include,
i
am
not
the
alien,
i
am
not
removable...
you
say
in
your
brief
they
could
hear
whether
the
alien
is
removable,
whether
the
ground
of
removal
is
one
which
precludes
judicial
review,
whether
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
and
whether
the
proceeding
is
fundamentally
unfair.
all
of
those,
you
say,
could
be
heard
under
this
statute...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
want
to
know
what
is
different
about
a
claim,
there
is
no
jurisdiction
because
this
whole
section
of
the
new
statute
simply
doesn't
apply.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there
are
five,
five
instances
in
this
case
in
which,
despite
the
language,
you
think
congress
has
decided
to
permit
the
very
review
that
the
language
seems
to
forbid.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine,
then
why
wouldn't
they
also
have
to
decide
the
question
of
whether
they
have
jurisdiction
at
all
because
this
major
section
of
the
new
statute
just
doesn't
apply?
