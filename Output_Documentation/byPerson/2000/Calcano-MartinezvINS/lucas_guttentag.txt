mr.
lucas
guttentag
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
jurisdictional
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
a
legal
ruling
by
the
attorney
general
on
a
pure
question
of
law
compelling
the
deportation
of
long-time
legal
permanent
residents
is
reviewable
in
any
court.
never
in
our
country's
history
has
an
alien
been
subject
to
deportation
without
the
judicial
branch
determining
the
legal
validity
of
the
administrative
deportation
order.
we
submit
that
the
constitution
does
not
permit
denying
judicial
scrutiny
of
the
attorney
general's
ruling,
and
that
the
statute
did
not
deprive
this
court
and
the
district
court
and
the
courts
of
appeals
of
considering
the
pure
question
of
law
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
your
honor...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
he
is...
our
clients
are
subject
to
the
deportability
grounds,
but
they
are
not
subject
to
deportation
without
an
adjudication
of
the
application
for
discretionary
relief.
the
final
order
of
deportation...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
well,
your
honor,
the
question
is
whether
the
final
order
of
deportation
was
properly
entered
and,
under
this
court's
case
law...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
no,
your
honor,
we
disagree
with
that,
respectfully.
the
final
order
of
deportation
cannot
be
entered
until
there
is
an
adjudication
on
the
application
for
discretionary
relief
if
the
person
is
eligible
to
apply.
in
this
case,
the
attorney
general...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
the
chadha
case,
your
honor,
the
foti
case,
all
said
that
the
final
order
of
deportation
is
contingent
on...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
yes.
in
all
those
cases,
your
honor,
the
question
was
whether
a
final
order
of
deportation,
and
whether
the
discretionary
element
that's...
on
which
the
final
order
is
contingent
was
reviewable
in
court,
and
the
way
the
immigration
act
is...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
yes,
but
the
iirira
has
not
changed
that
element,
your
honor.
under
the
immigration
act,
both
before
and
after,
there
is
a
two-part
process
for
issuing
a
final
order
of
deportation.
there's
the
question
of
deportability,
and
that's
the
question
of
whether
a
person
falls
within
the
grounds
enumerated
in
the
statute.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
we
do
concede
that,
your
honor.
there's
no
question
that
our
clients
conceded
that
they
fit
within
the
grounds
of
deportation.
then
the
second
question...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
well,
that's
a
construction
of
the
statute,
your
honor,
that
the
government's
offered.
we
don't
dispute
that,
although
we
come
to
that
conclusion
for
different
reasons,
but
the
question
is
whether
the
final
order
of
deportation
itself
is
reviewable,
and
the
final
order
cannot
be
entered...
and
i
believe
the
government
will
concede
this,
your
honor...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
well,
the
conviction
itself
is
a
basis
for
triggering
the
grounds
of
deportability.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
not
for
purposes
of
discretionary
relief,
your
honor.
that's
our
claim
on
the
merits
in
the
st.
cyr
case.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
yes.
our
basic
claim,
your
honor,
is...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
no,
we
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
our
claim
is
that
the
question
of
legal
eligibility
to
apply
for
the
discretionary
relief
is
reviewable.
the
attorney
general...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
question
of
a
categorical
denial
raises
a
different
issue,
and
whether
that's
permissible
or
not,
raises
a
distinct
question.
but
just
to
be
clear,
the
attorney
general
has
not
done
that
in
this
case.
what
the
attorney
general
has
said
is
that
he
lacks
the
legal
authority
to
exercise
discretion,
on
a
pure
question
of
interpreting
the
statute
that
congress
has
divested
him
of
the
legal
authority
to
consider
applications
for
discretionary
relief.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
attorney
general,
if
he
interpreted
this
statute
correctly,
would
adopt
a
categorical
rule.
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that.
he
has
determined
that
he
lacks
any
discretionary
authority.
how
he
exercises
that
authority
would
be
a
separate
and
distinct
question.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
no,
there's
not,
your
honor.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
well,
we
do
not...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
well,
we
certainly
agree
that
there's
not
a
legally
valid
final
order
of
deportation.
there
was
an
order
issued
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
so
in
that
sense
there's
a
piece
of
paper
that
constitutes
a
final
order,
but
we
agree
that
there's
not
a
legally
valid
final
order.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
the
(a)(2)...
well,
we
believe
there's
a
final
order
for
purposes
of
seeking
judicial
review
of
the
bia's
decision.
we
do
believe
that
that
constitutes
a
final
order.
we
believe
that
it
is
not
a
legally
valid
final
order
because
of
the
attorney
general's
ruling.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
well,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
statute,
the
(a)(2)(c)
does
not
apply
to
bar
review
of
this
claim.
what
the...
we
believe
that
the
provision
barring
review
does
not
apply.
whether
it's
because
it
doesn't
constitute
a
final
order
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
as
intended,
because
there's
a
legal
error
underlying
the
adjudication,
or
whether
there
is
a
final
order
but
it's
reviewable
nonetheless
for
that
legal...
because
it
lacks
legal
validity,
either
way
there's
review
of
that
determination.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
right,
and
that
is
an...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
we
would
certainly
accept
that
interpretation,
your
honor,
if
removable
is
not
the
term
that
normally
appears
in
the
immigration
act,
because
the
technical
term
would
be
deportable.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
no.
we
would...
i...
your
honor,
we
believe
that
it's
very
difficult
to
interpret
this
statute,
that...
[laughter]
that
the
one
thing
it
doesn't
do
is
preclude
review
of
the
legal
claim
presented
here.
whether
that's
because
the
term
is
removable...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
we
would
certainly
accept
that
interpretation.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
we've
argued
principally
that
the
term
review
does
not
preclude
the
scope
of
inquiry
that's
traditionally
be
encompassed
by
habeas
corpus
because
of
the
constitutional
problems
that
would
be
raised
by
barring
all
review.
we
believe
that...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
and
we...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
no,
we
absolutely
will
accept
that,
your
honor...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
because
we
believe
that
there
can
be
review
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
that
if
the
term
removable
means
only
a
properly
entered
final
order
of
removable...
removal,
then
our
clients
are
not
removable.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
they
are
subject
to...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
but
your
honor,
we
don't...
that
language
does
not
preclude
review
of
our
claim,
because
what
242(g)
does
is
place
all
review
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
we
agree
that
review
can
be
in
the
court
of
appeals.
we
have
no...
our
construction
of
the
statute
permits
that,
because
we
agree
that
the
final
order
of
removal
is
reviewable
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
only
provision
that
bars
review
of
that
order
in
the
court
of
appeals
is
(a)(2)(c).
mr.
lucas
guttentag
no,
your
honor.
we...
our
contention
is
only
that
there
would
be
review
in
the
district
court
as
a
fail-safe
mechanism
if
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
possible.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
we
recognize
that
the...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
we
believe
that
district
court
review
in
the...
excuse
me.
we
believe
that
habeas
corpus
review
in
the
district
courts
is
not
barred
by
the
language
of
this
statute,
but
that
the
scope
of
review
that
would
be
heard
in
the
district
courts
can
certainly
be
placed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
as
this
court
has
always
said
that
the...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
we...
the
second
circuit
held
that
there
was
district
court
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
because
it
first
concluded
that
there
was
no
review
possible
in
the
court
of
appeals.
we
believe
that
if
review
is
possible
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
we
believe
that
it
is,
because
(a)(2)(c)
should
be
construed
as
to
permit
review
in
the
court
of
appeals,
then
the
district
court
habeas
corpus
procedure
need
not
be
available.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
your
honor,
i
think
the
term
is
ambiguous,
because
it
is
not
the
term,
deportable,
which
is
what
the
immigration
statute
uses
to
determine
what...
to
say
that
someone
is
subject
to
deportation.
it
does
not
say,
subject
to
a
final
order
of
removal,
which
is...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
your
honor,
we
believe
it
means
that
someone
who
could
be
removable,
but
is
not
subject
to
final
order
of
removal,
so
therefore
the
statute
would
not
apply
to
that
individual.
it's
a
term
that
appears
in
various
places
in
the
immigration
act.
and
it
doesn't
have,
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
a
consistent
meaning
throughout
the
act.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
i
believe
it
appears
in
other
places
in
the
act.
it
appears
in
relation
to
detention
provisions
and
other
places.
it's
not
in
other
places
in
the...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
well,
we
don't
believe
it
does,
your
honor,
but
the
critical
question
is
whether
this
claim
must
be
reviewed
in
some
court,
and
we
believe
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
clear.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
well,
but
i
believe
it's
possible
to
read
it,
your
honor,
providing
a
properly
entered
final
order
of
removal,
and
that
would
include
the
proper,
legally
authorized
exercise
of
discretionary
relief,
that
if
the
statute
entitles...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
right,
but
our
contention
on
the
merits,
your
honor,
is
that
our
clients
are
eligible
for
the
discretionary
relief
as
it
existed
at
the
time
of
the
preenactment
event.
that's
a
pure
legal
question.
the
attorney
general
has
determined
that
they're
not
eligible.
the
question
of
eligibility
for
that
relief
was
decided
by
a
legal
ruling
of
the
attorney
general
that...
and
that
determines
whether
or
not
it
was
a
properly
entered
final
order
of
removal.
when
that
question
is
resolved,
then...
one
way
or
the
other
on
the
merits,
then
there'll
be
a
decision
on
whether
it
was
a
properly
entered
order.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
right,
and
that...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
yes,
and
that
whether
or
not
the
person
actually
committed
the
offense
is
a
question
of
whether
they
fit
within
one
of
the
enumerated
categories
that
are
set
forth
in
the
statute,
and
i
believe
the
government
does
concede
that.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
no,
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
that's
a
determination
that's
made
in
the
criminal
procedure,
and
when
that
certified
conviction
is
brought
before
the
immigration
judge,
that's
dispositive
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there's
a
disqualifying
conviction.
but
then
the
question
is
whether
that
conviction
constitutes
a
deportable
offense
within
the
meaning
of
the
immigration
act,
and
that's
a
question
that
the
government
agrees
is
reviewable
and,
as
i
indicated,
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
final
order
of
removal
was
properly
entered
must
be
reviewable
as
well,
and
if
there's
been
a
failure
to
allow
the
person
to
apply
for
the
discretionary
relief
for
which
they
are
entitled
by
statute,
then
that
cannot
be
a
legally
valid
order
of
removal,
and
again
i...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
we
believe
that
congress
did
significantly
restrict
the
scope
of
judicial
review
of
final
orders
issued
against
so-called
criminal
aliens.
we
recognize
that.
our
contention
is
only
that
the
core
review
that
has
always
existed
and
that
has
never
been
prohibited
as
to
questions
of
law
and
as
to
the
legal
validity
of
the
deportation
order,
that
that
issue
must
remain
reviewable;
that
there's
never
been
a
time
during
the
entire
period
when
review
was
severely
curtailed
under
the
finality
provisions
that
we
detail
in
our
brief
at
some
length;
that
there
was
a
long
period
of
time
when
there
was
no
review
of
orders
of
deportation
except
in
habeas
corpus
proceedings,
and
what
this
court
repeatedly
recognized
is
that
that
scope
of
review
is
extremely
narrow,
but
it
does
encompass
a
question
of
the
legal
validity
of
the
order,
and
questions
of
the
construction
of
the
immigration
act,
and
that's
what's
at
issue
here.
the
attorney
general
has
construed
the
immigration
act
to
say
that
our
clients
are
not
eligible
to
apply
for
the
exercise
of
discretion
to
which
the
statute
entitles
them.
that
question
must
be
reviewable
in
a
court
to
determine
whether
the
attorney
general
improperly
excluded
an
entire
class
of
people
from
eligibility
for
discretionary
relief,
and
this
court's
decision
in
foti
and
in
chadha
and
in
other
cases
recognized
that
the
final
order
is
contingent
on
the
issuance...
the
adjudication
of
discretionary
relief,
and
that
means
two
questions.
one
is...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
your
honor,
if
there
is
no
legally
issued
adjudication,
then
i
suppose
it's
accurate
to
say
there's
no
legally
valid
order,
and
so
therefore
there
isn't
a
final
order.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
well,
we
don't...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
it
depends
on
if
the
final
order
is
a
question
of
a
piece
of
paper
that
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
issues,
in
which
case
there
is
a
final
order,
or
whether
the...
there's
a
legally
valid
final
order...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
yes,
your
honor.
as
i
indicated,
there
must
be
that
piece
of
paper
from
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
saying
this
person
is
ordered
removed
from
the
united
states.
that's
what
triggers
section
1252.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
that's
exactly
our...
and
the
question
of
eligibility
for
relief
is
entirely
distinct
from
the
exercise
of
discretion.
once
the
attorney
general
makes
an
accurate
decision,
a
legally
valid
decision
as
to
eligibility
for
discretionary
relief,
then
the
exercise
of
discretion
follows.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
no,
your
honor,
we're
not,
and
we're
certainly
not
intending
to.
we
believe
that
there's
ambiguity
in
the
statute,
given
the
severe
constitutional
questions
that
would
be
raised
if
there
were
no
review
at
all
of
this
pure
question
of
law,
the
attorney
general's
decision,
and
that
ambiguity
can
come
from
the
term,
removable.
we
set
forth
in
our
brief
the
reason
why
we
think
the
term,
review,
is
not
sufficiently
clear
to
bar
the
scope
of
inquiry
that's
always
been
available
to
review
a
final
order.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
we
think
there
are
many
ambiguities.
i
believe
the
government
as
well
is
finding
ambiguities
in
this
statute.
it
is
a
statute
that
seeks
to
limit
the
role
of
the
courts,
and
our
contention
is
that
it
can
do
that,
but
it
cannot
preclude
the
courts
from
reviewing
and
determining
the
legal
validity
of
the
order,
and
that
that
is
a
question
that
is,
whether
there
are
legal...
in
this
case,
that
is
a
question
of
whether
there
is
a
legal
eligibility
determination.
we
think
the
accardi
case
is
very
significant
in
this
respect,
because
in
the
accardi
case,
this
court
confronted
the
question
of
the
scope
of
habeas
corpus
inquiry
to
review
a
final
order
of
deportation.
it
was
a
case
of
an
alien
who
was
admittedly
deportable,
there
was
no
issue
about
that,
and
claimed
that
he
had
not
gotten
a
lawful
exercise
of
discretion
because
the
attorney
general
had
refused
to
exercise
his
discretion,
as
was
required.
in
this
case...
and
the
court
held
that
that
was
reviewable
in
habeas
corpus
during
the
period
when
the
review
was
as
restricted
as
it
could
possibly
be,
the
year
after
this
court
said
in
the
heikkila
case
that
the
only
review
that
was
available
was
that
which
was
constitutionally
required.
now,
this
claim
is
even
more
fundamental.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
accardi
exercised
review.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
it
did
not...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
i...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
i
think,
your
honor...
it
did
not
specifically
say
that,
but
i
think
there's
two
points
that
are
important.
one,
it
was
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
decided
the
term
after
this
court
said
in
the
heikkila
case
that
the
only
review
that
was
available
was
that
which
was
required
by
the
constitution.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
i
don't
believe
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
but
may
i
point
out...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
may
i
point
out
what
the
dissent
said
in
accardi,
your
honor,
which
is
that
it
specifically
objected
to
the
court's
exercise
of
jurisdiction
on
the
ground
that
habeas
corpus
did
not
encompass
the
claim
raised
in
that
case,
and
it
objected
to
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
on
precisely
the
same
grounds
that
the
government
argues
here,
that
a
person
is
deportable,
that
it
concerns
discretionary
relief.
and
the
court
rejected
that,
and
exercised
discretion,
and
said
there's
a
fundamental
difference
between
reviewing
the
exercise
of
discretion
and
reviewing
the
refusal
to
exercise
discretion,
and
this
is
a
case
about
the
refusal
to
exercise
discretion
based
on
the
attorney
general's
legal
ruling
that
an
entire
class
of
individuals
is
not
eligible
for
relief.
and
it's
our...
our
only
challenge
is
to
that
determination
by
the
attorney
general,
that
his
legal
determination
as
to
who
is
eligible
to
apply
and
who
is
not
is
legally
incorrect,
and
we
believe
that
claim
must
be
reviewable
in
a
court.
it
can
be
the
court
of
appeals,
and
we
set
forth
why
we
believe
that
is
entirely
possible
and
appropriate,
but
it
must
be
reviewable
in
a
court.
i'd
like
to
save...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
thank
you.
i
want
to
be
clear
that,
under
the
statute,
there's
no
final
order
of
deportation
until
the
application
for
discretionary
relief
is
adjudicated.
that
has
been
the
case
since
these
statutes
were
first
enacted
in
1917,
when
discretionary...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
the
chadha
case
stands
for
that
proposition,
your
honor.
the
foti
case
clearly
stands
for
that
proposition.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
there
continues
to
be
the
case
that
the
regulations
require
that,
your
honor.
there's
no
doubt
about
that,
that
the
regulations
require
the
immigration
judge
to
adjudicate
an
application
for
relief.
that,
in
and
of
itself,
is
a
duty.
secondly,
the
cases
do
say
that
the
final
order
is
contingent
on
the
determination,
and
this
is
not
about
the
exercise...
mr.
lucas
guttentag
it's
212...
it
was
212e(b)(2),
i
believe,
and
it's
currently
also
the
regulation
governing
the
current
version
of
that,
which
is
the
cancellation
of
removal,
and
i'd
be
happy
to
provide
it
at
the
next
case,
if
that's...
that
that
final
order...
and
i
don't
believe
the
government
would
actually
contend
that
under
the
statute
as
it's
currently
implemented,
and
as
it
has
been
since
1917,
and
under
the
regulations
that
govern,
that
a
final
order
could
be
entered
with
the
immigration
judge
or
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
the
attorney
general
simply
say,
i
refuse
to
adjudicate
your
application
for
relief.
if
the
attorney
general
determines
that
the
individual
is
not
legally
eligible,
then
so
be
it,
but
that
claim
is
reviewable.
if
the
attorney
general
exercises
discretion,
then
that
is
not
reviewable,
and
we
concede
that.
the...
what
the...
what
this
court
has
said
about
the
pardon
analogy
to
the
discretionary
decision
goes
to
the
exercise
of
discretion.
that's
very
clear
from
the
jay
v.
boyd
case.
it's
clear
from
the
yang
case,
your
honor,
where
the
exercise
of
discretion
is
not
reviewable,
but
the
question
of
whether
the
attorney
general
has
properly
construed
who
is
eligible,
the
attorney
general
in
this
case
has
said
that
an
entire
class
of
individuals
is
ineligible
because
i
determined
that,
congress
instructed
me
to
apply
this
law
retroactively.
whether
the
statute
applies
retroactively
or
not
is
a
question
that
the
courts
must
decide.
that's
what
landgraf
said,
and
it's
for
congress
to
legislate
clearly
and
specifically
what
the
temporal
scope
of
the
statute
is,
and
that's
not
for
the
attorney
general
to
determine.
i
also,
in
regard
to
the
particular
provision
governing
the
review
of
discretionary
decisions
that
mr.
kneedler
referred
to,
that
refers
to
particular
determinations
there
in
the...
that
are
in
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general.
for
example,
asylum
claims
remain
reviewable,
so
it's
clear
that
the
preclusion
provision
here
still
would
do
a
significant
amount
of
work,
and
as
far
as
the
definition
of
what
constitute...
of
what
removable
means,
that
definition
does
not
specifically
apply
to
the
term
in
section
1252,
in
the
judicial
review
provision.
it
is
a
definition,
but
it
does
not
specifically
apply
to
what
we
have
at
issue
here.
and
finally,
in
terms
of
the
government
arguing
that
the
attorney
general
could
simply
decide
to
deny
any
exercise
of
discretion,
that
is
the
chennary
principle,
that
the
decision
of
the
attorney
general
must
be,
correct
or
not...
