justice
ruth
bader

mr.
guttentag,
may
i
just
add
a
post
script
on
that
question
to...
suppose
the
attorney
general
were
to
say,
in
light
of
aedpa,
and
however
you
pronounce
the
other
statute,
i
have
decided
that
henceforth
i
will
exercise
my
discretion
never
to
be
gracious,
and
i
will
simply
deny
these
applications.
it
is
as
an
exercise
of
discretion,
and
it's
in
tune
with
what
i
think
is
the
current
climate
in
the
legislature.
you
just
answered
justice
souter
that
you
would
not
challenge
an
exercise
of
discretion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
includes
saying
you
didn't
intend
us
to
have
discretion?
that
seems
to
me
very
odd.
if
the
question
is,
is
there
discretion,
then
how
is
it
compatible
with
that
scheme
for
the
secretary
to
say,
i'm
going
to
determine
as
a
matter
of
administrative
fiat
that
there
is
no
discretion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
she...
he
exercised
his
discretion
in
a
totally
arbitrary
way
to
say,
admitting
people,
setting
grace
on
people
of
one
race
or
one
religion,
even
so,
that's
just
not
reviewable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
argument
that
congress
never
gave
the
attorney
general
such
authority?
we
don't
get
to
any
grand
constitutional
issue,
but
discretion
must
be
exercised
reasonably.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
is
the
concept
of
abuse
of
discretion...
his
authority
to
exercise
discretion,
there's
lots
of
discretion
in
federal
agencies,
but
there's
also
a
concept
of
abuse
of
discretion,
and
you
seem
to
be
saying
no,
there
isn't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler,
may
i
ask
you
just
to
clarify
what
you...
you
say
there
are
a
number
of
categories
where
there
is
court
review
before
the
person
is
removed,
and
one
of
them
is
a
substantial
constitutional
challenge
to
an
aggravated
felony,
removal
order.
i
was
trying
to
envision
what
such
a
challenge
would
be,
given
the
tightness
of
the
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
was
wrong
with
the
court
of
appeals
saying,
if
there's
nothing
else,
there's
always
the
general
habeas,
unless
congress
says
specifically...
mentioning
the
statutory
provision
by
number
or
name.
that
essentially
was
the
second
circuit's
position,
was
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
the
answer...
the
second
circuit
was
saying,
we
accept
what
the
government
tells
us,
there's
no
review
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
congress
has
not
deleted
the
general
habeas
authority.
