mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1996,
in
two
separate
statutes,
congress
fundamentally
restructured
the
nation's
immigration
laws.
there
are
amendments
of
general
applicability,
and
also
ones
specifically
dealing
with
criminal
aliens
to
ensure
that
criminal
aliens
were
expeditiously
removed
from
the
united
states.
briefly,
the
three
amendments
of
general
applicability
that
are
most
relevant
to
these
two
cases
this
morning
are
congress's
elimination
of
deportation
and
exclusion
proceedings,
and
replacing
them
with
a
single
proceeding
called
removal.
secondly,
congress
repealed
the
prior
1182(c)
under
which
petitioners
here
seek
relief,
and
replaced
it
with
a
new
proceeding,
or
form
of
discretionary
relief
called
cancellation
of
removal,
and
third,
congress
reenacted,
or
enacted
a
new
judicial
review
provision
which
channeled
judicial
review,
if
it's
to
be
had
at
all,
to
the
courts
of
appeals.
the
two
amendments
specifically
dealing
with
criminal
aliens
that
are
relevant
here
is
that
congress
not
only
repealed
the
prior
1182(c),
but
rendered
aggravated
felons
and
in
some
cases
other
criminal
aliens
altogether
ineligible
for
cancellation
of
removal,
and
secondly,
congress
provided
in
section
1252(a)(2)(c)
of
the
act
that
no
court,
which
includes
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court,
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
remove...
to
review
an
order
of
removal
entered
against
an
alien
who
had
committed
one
of
the
specified
criminal
offenses.
the
theory
was
that
an
alien,
just
like
a
citizen,
would
have
full
access
to
the
courts
to
contest
the
criminal
conviction
in
the
criminal
proceedings,
both
direct
review
and
collateral
attack,
but
once
that
was
done,
the
validity
of
the
conviction
was
established,
and
therefore,
with
respect
to
access
to
the
courts,
there
was
really
no
further
need
to
test
the
central
basis
on
which
the
alien
was
to
be
removed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
unless
and
until
the
criminal
conviction
was
set
aside,
it
would
be
a
conviction
on
which
the
removal
order
could
be
based.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
wouldn't
think
that
would
be
true,
but
i
think
typically
what
would
happen
is
the
immigration
judge
would
stay
the
removal
proceedings.
i
think
that
happens.
i'm
aware
of
some
cases
where
that
has
happened.
what
the
alien
should
do
is...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
would
be,
i
think,
probably...
i'm
not
certain
about
that,
but
there
may
be
access
to
the
court
to
stay
the
removal.
ordinarily
you
couldn't
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
direct...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
i
meant
the...
i
meant
the
review
in
the
immigration
proceedings
going
to
the
court
of
appeals.
i'm
not
certain
which
avenue...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
there
is...
if
the
claim
was...
if
the
alien
was
in
a
position
that
the
substantive
ground
for
removal
may
be
invalid,
and
that's...
not
the
eligibility
for
discretionary
relief,
but
the
substantive
ground
of
removal
may
be
invalid
because
there's
an
ongoing
collateral
attack,
then
i...
my
assumption
is
that
some
court...
first
of
all,
i
think
the
immigration
court
would
stop
it,
or
the
bia
could
prevent
the
proceedings
from
going
forward,
either
one,
or
the
attorney
general,
but
failing
that,
i'm
confident
that
some
court
would
probably
have
review.
i'm
not
sure
whether...
perhaps
the
collateral
review
court,
although
i'm
not
sure
why
that
would
be
so,
because
it
could
be
a
state
collateral
proceeding
that
the
alien
was
trying
to
have
his
conviction,
state
court
conviction
set
aside
in,
and
i
wouldn't
think
that
court
would
have
any
authority
to
enjoin
a
removal
under
federal
immigration
law,
so
it
may
be
that
the
alien
could
apply
to
the
district
director
and
perhaps...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
seek
a
stay
of
removal
in
that
way.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
sure.
the
immigration
judge
would
have
the
authority
to
stay
the
proceedings.
that
was
the
answer
that
i...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thought
i
was
giving.
but
the
more
fundamental
point
is,
the
alien
wouldn't
be
removed
until
there
was
a
final
order
of
removal
entered
against
him
by
the
bia.
if
at
that
point
the
alien
was
saying,
wait
a
minute,
i'm
seeking
to
have
my
criminal
conviction
set
aside,
don't
execute
the
order
of
removal,
while
there
may
be
an
invalidity
here,
the
alien
could
seek
a
stay
of
removal
in
the
court
of
appeals,
could
move
to
reopen
the
proceedings...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
court
of
appeals
would
not
be
required
to
issue
a
stay
of
removal,
but
if
it
was
the
first...
i
was
just
addressing
the
question
of
power,
not
whether
it
should
be...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
no,
absolutely,
and
i
think
as
a
general
rule
there
would
be
no
question.
i
was
just
addressing
there
might,
in
an
extreme
case,
be
some
cases...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there's
a
fundamental
difference
between
the
case
i
think
you
were
positing
and
this
one.
that
case
had
to
do
with
the
substantive
ground
for
removability.
in
other
words,
is
the
person
removable
for
having
committed
an
aggravated
felony?
here,
the
question
is
quite
different.
as
counsel
for
petitioners
has
said,
petitioners
concede
that
they
are
removable.
the
only
question
here
is
whether
the
attorney
general
properly
denied...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
last
step
was
taken.
there
was
a
final
order
of
removal
entered
against
the
aliens.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
if
i
could
just
give
two
responses
to
that.
the
preclusion
of
review
under
1252(a)(2)(c),
which
was
set
out
at
106(a)
of
our
certiorari
petition,
it
refers
to
an
alien
who
is
removable
by
reason
of
having
committed
a
criminal
offense
covered
in
certain
sections
of
the
act.
the
word
removable
doesn't
stand
alone
there.
it
is
removable
by
reason
of
having
committed
an
offense.
it
is
identifying
the
aliens
who...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
this
would
only...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it's
identifying
the
subset
of
aliens
against
whom
a
final
order
has
been
entered,
to
whom
this
preclusion
of
review
applies,
and
it's...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
this
was
a
preclusion
of
review
that
was
obviously
intended
to
accomplish
something,
and
petitioners...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
not
governed
by
paragraph
(c).
that
is
governed
by
the
preceding
paragraph,
1252(a)(2)(b)
on
the
same
page,
which
independently
bars
any
judgment
regarding
the
granting
of
relief
under
certain
specified
sections,
or
any
other
decision
that
is
vested
in
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general,
so
that
category
of
decisions
that
are...
that
petitioners
are
conceding
is
not
even
addressed
by
this
provision.
this
provision
must
mean
something
else,
and
we
think
it
quite
clearly
encompasses
denial
of
discretionary
relief
by
the
attorney
general,
whether
that
denial
is
based
on
an
exercise
of
discretion
or
the
attorney
general's
determination
that
congress
has
not
conferred
on
him
the
power
to
exercise
discretion.
in
either
event,
the
alien
has
been
denied
relief
that
congress
has
specified
is
discretionary,
and
as
that...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
because
they...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
attorney
general
certainly
has
jurisdiction
to
decide
whether
to
grant
discretionary
relief.
the
attorney
general
can
decide
that
on
a
variety
of
factors,
including
the
attorney
general's
understanding
of
the
statute,
just
as
a
discretionary
determination
to
exercise
prosecutorial
discretion
not
to
bring
an
administrative
proceeding
that
was
before
this
court
in
food
and
nutrition
workers
you
could
decide,
the
agency
could
decide
not
to
bring
the
case
because
they
didn't
think
the
equities
warranted
it,
or
because
of
an
interpretation
of
the
statute.
that
interpretation
may
be
wrong,
but
when
something...
when
congress
intends
to
vest
something
in
the
discretion
of
an
administrative
officer,
that
includes
legal
issues
that
may
bear
on
the
exercise
of
discretion...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
what
congress
has
done
is
vest
in
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
the
responsibility
for
interpreting
and
administering
the
immigration
laws,
and
in
section
1103,
that
this
court
relied
upon
in
the
ageri-ageri
case,
this
court
said
that
the
attorney
general's
interpretation
of
the
immigration
laws
is
controlling.
congress...
in
other
words,
what
congress
did
with
respect
to
the
question
at
issue
here
was
to
vest
the
final
determination
whether
to
grant
discretionary
relief
in
the
attorney
general,
whether
that
is
based
on
an
interpretation
of
the
statute,
or
the
exercise
of
discretion,
or
sometimes
a
combination
of
the
two.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
in
accardi,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
it's
difficult
to
figure
out
exactly
on
what
basis
jurisdiction
was
exercised
in
accardi.
the
supreme
court...
this
court...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
one
thing
to
bear
in
mind
is
that
the
petitioner
in
accardi
argued
the
case
in
terms
of
a
due
process
violation.
what
was
alleged
there
was
that
the
attorney
general
had
engaged
in
prejudgment
and
had
deliberately
subverted
an
administrative
scheme
for
adjudicating
discretionary
applications,
and
the
petitioner
argued
that
that
was
a
violation
of
due
process.
now,
this
court
subsequently
has
said
in
the
university
of
missouri,
in
435
u.s.,
that
accardi
did
not
state
a
rule
of
constitutional
law
binding
on
the
states,
so
in
light
of
subsequent
understandings
of
what
accardi
stood
for,
it
would
seem
odd
that
if
it
didn't
state
a
fundamental
rule
of
constitutional
law
that
is
binding
on
the
states,
that
it
would
nonetheless
be
the
sort
of
thing
that
congress
would
be
compelled
to
provide
judicial
review
of
under
the
immigration
laws.
i
wanted
to
respond
to
two
statutory
questions,
and
then
perhaps
explore
this
point
further.
petitioners
have
relied
on
the
foti
and
chadha
cases
with
respect
to
the
final
order
of
removal
being
contingent
upon
the
exercise
of
discretion,
in
those
cases
suspension
of
deportation.
that...
the
court
explored
that,
though,
solely
for
purposes
of
deciding
which
court
would,
as
a
statutory
matter,
have
jurisdiction
over
the
particular
claim
there,
and
what
the
court
said
is,
sensibly
it
only...
it
makes
sense
for
suspension
of
deportation
claims
to
be
heard
in
the
courts
of
appeals
because
the
attorney
general
has
chosen
to
adjudicate
applications
for
suspension
of
deportation
together
with
the
substantive
basis
for
deportation
in
one
single
proceeding.
but
the
court
made
pretty
clear
in
foti
that
the
attorney
general
was
not
required
to
do
that,
and
it
would
have
been
equally
consistent
with
the
act
for
the
attorney
general
to
determine
whether
to
grant
relief
to
particular
aliens
outside
of
the
affirmative
removal
proceeding
as
a
matter
of
discretion,
maybe
on
a
sort
of
certiorari
jurisdiction
to
the
attorney
general
to
decide
at
the
close
of
the
case
whether
to
do
that
or
not,
and
that
remains
the
case
under
the
current
law.
nothing
in
the
act
requires
that
the
attorney
general
adjudicate
an
application
for
1182(c)
relief,
or
for
cancellation
of
removal
before
entering
a
final
order
of
removal.
the
regulations
provide
that
method
of
adjudication,
but
nothing
in
the
act
does,
and
the
question,
i
think,
for
purposes
of
whether
judicial
review
is
compelled
is
whether
there
is
a
statutory
right,
because
after
all,
congress
has
plenary
power
over
immigration,
over
the
jurisdiction
of
the
lower
federal
courts,
and
broad
power
over
the
fashioning
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
as
this
court
said
in
felker,
and
congress
could
legitimately
decide
if
there
is
not
a
statutory
right
to
have
an
application
for
cancellation
or
1182(c)
relief
adjudicated
in
a
particular...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
but
in
this
respect,
what...
with
respect
to
whether
the
person
is
an
alien,
and
with
respect
to
whether
he
is
removable...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
by
reason
of
having
committed
an
offense.
a
reviewing
court
has
to
decide
those
questions
in
deciding
whether
the
statutory
preclusion...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
for
the
reasons
that
i
said,
that...
for
the
reason
that
i
said,
is
that
the
act
does
not
require
that.
all
1182(c)
said
is
the
attorney
general
may
admit
an
alien.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
what
proceeding
that
will
be
held
in.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
whether
or
not
there
would
be...
whether
or
not
there
would
be
a
review
of
a
constitutional
claim
we
think
would
be
a
different
matter.
for
example,
in
chadha,
chadha
was
a
constitutional
challenge
to
the
statute
governing
suspension
of
deportation.
it
may
be
that
congress
would
have
intended
that
a
constitutional
challenge
to
the
statute
under
which
the
attorney
general
was
granting
or
denying...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the...
all
the
act
says
is
that
the
attorney
general
may
admit
an
alien
and,
with
that
sort
of
discretionary
grant
of
authority,
this
court
has
said
in
cases
like
jay
v.
boyd,
and
maybe
five
terms
ago,
i
think
it
was,
in
the
yang
case,
that
that
is
like
the
power
of
pardon.
it's
a
power
of
dispensation.
it
is
a
power
of
the
attorney
general
to
relieve
an
alien
of
the
admitted
consequences
of
an
order
of
removal,
to
lift
the
consequence
of
removal
and
allow
the
alien
to
remain
here.
it
is
a
matter
of
grace,
in
no
sense
a
matter
of
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
not
every
situation
in
which
someone,
an
administrative
officer
has
been
afforded
a
right
to
exercise
discretion,
is
there
judicial
review
of
that.
i
mean,
this
court
has
on
a
number
of
occasions,
like
heikkila
v.
cheney,
and
like
food
and
nutrition
workers,
and
with
respect
to
the
census,
an
issue
of
major
magnitude,
this
court
held
that
there
was
no
review
of
statutory
questions
or
discretionary
issues
in
that
situation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
to
the
pardon
power.
i
assume
we
wouldn't
review
the
president's
refusal
to
exercise
the
pardon
power
for
abuse
of
discretion.
absolutely,
and
this
isn't
to
say
that
the
attorney
general
may
not...
or
the
president
at
some
point
may
decline
to
exercise
the
pardon
power
for
a
reason
that
would
be
thought
contrary
to
law,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
possibility
of
getting
a
pardon,
or
in
this
case
a
discretionary
dispensation
from
removal,
gives
right
to
a
personal
right
that
the
constitution
requires
congress
to
provide
access
to
the
courts
to
litigate.
and
congress
enacted
iirira
against
the
background
of
great
frustration
with
the
inability
of
the
system
to
remove
criminal
aliens
from
the
united
states,
and
because
of
the
potential
for
criminal
aliens
to
tie
up
the
courts
in
trying
to
stave
off
the
removal.
this
is
an
example
of
this
in
this
very
case,
that
these
aliens
unquestionably
are
removal...
removable,
have
conceded
it,
and
yet
we
are
litigating
a
number
of
years
later
on
the
question
of
whether
the...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
true,
because
again,
what
congress
has
done
has
granted
a
discretionary
authority
to
the
attorney
general
to
decide
whether
to
dispense
with
removal
or
not,
and
let
me...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
again,
going
back
to
the
language
of
paragraph
(c),
there
are
two
different
clauses.
one
says,
review
any
final
order,
so
that's
the
passage
that
deals
with
there
having
been
an
order
entered,
and
then
it
says,
against
an
alien
who
is
removable
by
reason
of
having
committed
a
criminal
offense.
that
is
simply
identifying
which
aliens,
which
ground
of
removal
triggers
the
preclusion
of
review...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
the
question...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
but
again,
i...
removable
does
not
stand
alone.
it
says,
removable
by
reason
of
having
committed
the
offense.
i
think
it
does
no
more
than
identify
the...
if
i
could
mention
one
other
thing.
the
word
removable
is
defined
in
the
act,
but
for...
this
is
in
8
u.s.c.
1229a(e)(2),
which
is
not
reproduced
in
the
papers,
but
since
the
question
was
raised,
it
is
part
of
the
provision
that
deals
with
removal
proceedings,
and
it
says...
now,
again,
it
says
in
this
section,
meaning
the
section
dealing
with
removal,
and
the
next
section,
which
deals
with
cancellation
of
removal,
the
statute
says,
the
term
removable
means,
in
the
case
of
an
alien
who
hasn't
been
admitted,
that
the
alien
is
inadmissable
under
1182
of
the
act,
or,
in
the
case
of
an
alien
admitted
to
the
united
states,
such
as
the
aliens
here,
that
the
alien
is
deportable
under
section
1227
of
this
title.
in
other
words,
the
term
is
meant
to
identify
the
substantive
ground
on
removal
that...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
a...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
the
paragraph
(c)
goes
on
to
identify
the
specific
statutory
provisions
that
it
is
referring
to,
and
they
are
all
substantive
grounds
of
removal.
they
are
not...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
true.
i
mean,
as
you
pointed
out,
read
expansively
it
could
go
to
any
question
that
might
be
thought
to
call
into
question
the
propriety
of
the
attorney
general's
action.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
it
separately
addresses
that
in
the
preceding
line
by
saying,
review
of
a
final
order,
and
then
it's
which
final
order,
so
i
think
it's
already...
i
think
congress
has
already
spoken
to
that
question.
i...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
suppose
there
could
be...
we
don't
think
it
would
fail,
but
i
mean...
we
don't
think
it
would
succeed,
but
if
there
were
some
argument
that
it
would
be
constitutionally
impermissible
to
apply
a
ground
of
deportation
to
conduct
that
arose
before
the
statute
was
passed,
or
that
there
was
some
sort
of
equal
protection
violation
in
singling
out
one
ground
of
removal
over
another
in
providing
a
ground
for
removal,
that
could
be
a
constitutional
challenge
to
the
statute
under
which
the
person
is
being
ordered
removed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
they
have
not
made
a
constitutional...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we...
i
think
not.
i
think
that
the...
i
think
the
only
thing
that
could
be
done
would
be
to
challenge
the
constitutional
ground
of
removal.
congress...
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
one
thing
that
is
clear
from
the
legislative
background
of
the
passage
of
iirira
and
aedpa
is
that
congress
wanted
to
expeditiously
remove
criminal
aliens
from
the
united
states,
and
it
regarded
the
entry
of
the
judgment
of
conviction
as
a
sufficient
ground
for
doing
so.
it
did
not
want
to
provide...
first,
in
our
view,
we
believe
congress
eliminated
discretionary
grounds
for
removal,
but
it
surely
would
not
have
intended
to
have
litigation
over
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
is,
but
it
wouldn't
be
at
all
surprising
that
in
the
climate
in
which
congress
acted,
what
congress
wanted
to
do
was
to
vest
the
final
determination
on
questions
such
as
that
in
the
attorney
general.
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
the
attorney
general
could
have
just
decided,
taking
into
account
the
recent
legislative
enactment,
simply,
even
if
the
act
applied,
to
say,
i'm
not
granting
relief
to
anyone
whom
congress
has
identified
as
an
unworthy
to
remain
here,
and
there's
no
question
that
that
would
be
a
permissible
exercise
of
discretion,
which
shows
that
it
can't
be
a
fundamental
right...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
this
court
held
in
the
lopez
case...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
this
is
a
statute...
again,
looking
at
the
statute,
in
which
congress
has
given
the
power
to
the
attorney
general,
but
unlike,
for
example,
the
asylum
provision,
the
asylum
provision
says
in
section
208,
the
attorney
general
shall
establish
a
procedure
for
aliens
to
file
applications
for
asylum,
meaning
that
the
attorney
general
has
to
at
least
be
in
a
position
to
receive
an
application
and
do
something
with
it.
there
is
no
such
provision
in
this
act
that
requires
the
attorney
general
to
receive
and
consider
a
particular
application
for
relief
from
deportation,
just
as
there
is
nothing
to
require
the
president
to
actually
entertain
and
pass
upon
an
application
for
a
pardon,
and
this
court
said
in
jay
v.
boyd
that
this
relief
is
to
be
regarded
much
as
the
application
for
a
pardon
to
the
president
of
the
united
states.
one
final
point
i
want
to
make
clear
is
that,
whatever
else
may
be
true
with
respect
to
judicial
review,
the
court
of
appeals
was
certainly
wrong
to
say
that
judicial
review
would
be
in
the
district
court.
it
would
stand
this
act
on
its
head
to
suggest
that
criminal
aliens
whom
congress
wanted
to
remove
from
the
country
with
particular
emphasis
would
be
able
to
go
to
the
district
courts,
get
a
level
of
review
there,
go
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
then
perhaps
to
this
court.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
there's
no
requirement
that
congress,
in
order
to
channel
all
review
to
a
court
of
appeals,
has
to
specifically
mention
2241,
but...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
congress
did
two
things
before
iirira
was
enacted
in
section
401(e),
in
a
provision
called,
elimination
of
habeas
corpus,
congress
repealed
the
prior
provision
for
habeas
corpus
relief
and
secondly,
in
the
provision
enacted
here,
it
channeled
all
review
to
the
courts
of
appeals.
