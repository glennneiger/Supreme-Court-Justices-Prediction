chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
00-1011,
deboris
calcano-martinez
v.
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
mr.
guttentag.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
authority
for
that
proposition,
mr.
guttentag,
your
case
authority?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
was
not
talking
about
the
attorney
general's
discretion,
was
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
was
before
the
iirira,
or
however
you
pronounce
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
concede
those
have
been
met
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
say
there's
also
then
habeas
review
in
the
district
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
what...
but
not
under
habeas,
you
just
said,
as
i
understood.
do
you
or
do
you
not
think
habeas
review
in
the
district
court
is
available?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
you
don't
agree
with
the
second
circuit's
decision
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
think
the
term,
removable,
in
(a)(2)(c)
means?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
what
do
you...
what
do
you...
how
do
you
interpret
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
it
adopted
just
in
connection
with
this
provision
that
provided
an
alien
who
was
convicted
of
a
felony
should
be
deported?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
you
could
go
behind
a
judgment
of
conviction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
you
need
a
final
order
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
first
place?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
this
is
a
final
order,
as
you're
talking
about,
1252
says
no
court
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
review
any
final
order
of
this
sort.
i
mean,
are
you
using
final
order
in
two
different
senses?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you're
got
three
different
ambiguities
in
one
sentence
that
you've
focused
on?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
guttentag.
mr.
kneedler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
alien
has
already
had
a
couple
of
habeas
petitions
challenging
his
criminal
conviction,
which
have
decided
against
him,
he
now
gets
a
final
order,
and
he
says,
well,
i
just
filed
a
third
habeas
application?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
yes,
but
ordinarily
you
don't
need
a
habeas
review
or
collateral
review
to
establish
the
validity
of
a
conviction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
done
on
direct
review,
and
when
that
judgment
becomes
final,
the
conviction
is...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
guttentag,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
guttentag.
the
case
is
submitted.
