justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
claim
is
that
you
are
entitled
to
an
adjudication
at
the
administrative
level,
ultimately
by
the
attorney
general,
under
a
statute
that
contains
this
discretion.
that's...
isn't
that
your
basic
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
now...
okay.
let
me
ask
you
part
2
of
my
question.
do
you
also
claim
that
if
you
are,
or
if
your
client
in
this
case
is
entitled
to
an
exercise
of
discretion,
that
the
exercise
of
discretion
itself
is
reviewable
for
abuse
of
discretion?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
one
difference,
then,
that
has
been
made,
that
as
i
understand
it
that
you
concede,
is
that
on
your
view,
once
it
is
determined
that
the
attorney
general
did
apply
the
statute
that
authorizes
discretion,
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
review.
there
could
not
be
a
further
step
in
which
you
say,
the
refusal
to
exercise
it
in
favor
of
my
client
was
an
abuse
of
discretion.
you
concede
that,
i
take
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think
you're...
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you've
got
a
final
order
for
purposes
of
seeking
review,
but
if
you
get
the
review,
you
say,
well,
it
is
not
a
valid
final
order
because
it
was
entered
without
application
of
the
authority
to
grant
discretion.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
they're
saying
the
last
step
is
the
exercise...
they're
saying,
the
statute
that
invests
him
with
discretion
still
applies
to
my
case.
he's
not
applying
that
statute.
he
is
categorically
refusing
to
exercise
discretion
because
he
says
he
doesn't
have
it,
and
he's
wrong.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
but
the
statute
identifies
them
by
reference
to
what
may
be
done
to
them.
i
mean,
i
think
i'm
bothered
by
the
same
thing
that
justice
kennedy
is
getting
at.
the
word
removable
refers
not
merely
to
their
alien
status,
and
not
merely
to
their
conviction.
it
refers
necessarily
to
a
statute
which
makes
them
removable,
and
if,
as
you
concede,
they
can
challenge
the
alien
status,
they
can
challenge
the
fact
of
the
conviction,
why,
by
a
parity
of
reasoning,
may
they
not
also
challenge
the
fact
that
the
statute
that
the
attorney
general
is
operating
under
doesn't
make
them
removable
until
discretion
has
been
exercised?
how
do
you
draw
that
line?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
their
answer
is,
what
it
accomplished
is,
no
more
review
of
the
exercise
of
discretion
when
the
discretion
is
exercised.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
you
are
doing
when
you
say
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
reading
the
words
of
the
statute
that
says,
removable
by
virtue
of
the
criminal
convictions
and
so
on,
to
mean
not
removable,
but
to
mean
ordered
removed
by
the
attorney
general.
you
are
taking
a
statute
that
says
removable,
and
you
are
reading
it
to
say,
ordered
removed,
thereby
insulating
the
courts,
or
the
alien
from
the
possibility
of
challenging
the
correctness
of
the
statute
under
which
the
attorney
general
is
acting.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that's...
no,
but
that's
the
question
in
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
doing
anything
other
than
identifying
the
kind
of
order
by
the
attorney
general,
or
is
it
doing
something
more?
is
it
saying,
the
attorney
general
must
be
acting
under
a
statute
under
which
it
is
proper
for
him
to
make
an
order
of
removal
without
admitting
any
discretion.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
the
issue
in
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
term
requires
two
things.
it
requires
a
substantive
ground.
it
also
requires
a
statute
under
which
the
substantive
ground
is
sufficient
by
the
attorney
general
operating
under
the
statute...
justice
david
h.
souter
and
they're
saying...
they're
not
challenging
the
ground
that
says,
i'm
an
alien,
or
the
ground
that
says,
i
have
a
conviction.
they're
challenging
the
attorney
general's
operation
under
a
statute
that
they
say
doesn't
apply,
and
removable
can
cover
that
just
as
well
as
it
can
cover
the
substantive
grounds
relied
upon
for
the
removal.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
if
congress
wanted
to
make
that
point,
clearly,
congress
would
have
said,
anybody
who
is
ordered
removed
by
reason
of
being
an
alien
with
a
criminal
conviction.
that's
not
what
congress...
