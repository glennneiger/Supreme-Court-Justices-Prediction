justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
the
legal
validity
of
his
deportation
is
at
issue.
in
what
respect
do
you
claim
he
is
not
properly
deportable?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
understood
it,
it
is
conceded
that
he
met
the
qualifications
for
deportation.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
you're
complaining
about
is
that
the
attorney
general
did
not
accord
them
discretionary
relief,
but
all
of
your
grounds
for
asserting
that
you're
not
deportable
you
had
an
opportunity
to
challenge
in
court,
didn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
properly
entered
if
all
of
the
qualifications
for
deportation
existed.
your
complaint
is
that
the
attorney
general
did
not
exercise
his
discretion
to
let
your
client
stay
in
the
country
nonetheless.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
also
that
all
of
those
grounds
can
be
challenged
in
court,
that
iirira
does
not
prevent
judicial
review
of
all
of
those
grounds
of
deportation,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
didn't...
you
don't...
i'm
sure
you
would,
but
unfortunately...
justice
antonin
scalia
well...
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
guttentag...
justice
antonin
scalia
may
i
suggest
that
the
reason
you
didn't
make
that
argument
is
that
it's
not
a
very
good
one,
because
there
is
more
than
one
section
which
excludes
the
judicial
review
that
you're
seeking.
not
all
of
them
contain
that
phrase,
who
is
removable.
subsection
(g),
entitled,
exclusive
jurisdiction,
does
not
use
the
term.
it
says,
except
as
provided
in
this
section,
and
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law,
no
court
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
any
cause
or
claim
by
or
on
behalf
of
any
alien
arising
from
the
decision
or
action
by
the
attorney
general
to
commence
proceedings,
adjudicate
cases,
or
execute
removal
orders
against
any
alien
under
this
act.
it
does
not
contain
the
language
that
you
now
want
to
rely
upon.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
ask
this,
if
who
is
removable,
if
that
embraces
the
requirement
that
the
attorney
general
first
have
exercised
his
discretion,
why
doesn't
it
also,
under
that
kind
of
a
reading,
embrace
the
requirement
that
he
actually
committed
a
criminal
offense
covered
in
section
1182(a)(2)?
i
mean,
if
you're
going
to
read
removable,
who
is
removable
that
broadly,
that
is
to
say
that
any
defect
in
the
proceedings
which
rendered
the
order
of
removal
invalid
causes
him
not
to
be
removable,
you
simply
open
up
the
whole
statute.
you
say
any
defect
which
causes
him
not
to
be
removable
takes
him
out
of
(a)(2)(c).
i
mean,
it
just
cuts
a
swath
through
the
entire
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
your
constitutional
argument,
but
we're
trying
to
discuss
first
a
proposed
statutory
argument
which
would
avoid
our
reaching
that,
and
i'm
suggesting
that
if
you
read
who
is
removable
to
embrace...
to
make
a
person
unremovable
where
anything
that
should
have
been
done
has
not
been
done,
you
open
up
the
whole
prior
proceedings.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
accardi
say
that
review
was
constitutionally
required?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that...
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
don't
know
the
basis
on
which
it
exercised
jurisdiction,
and
our
cases
are
clear
that
cases
which
do
not
address
the
jurisdictional
question
are
not
authority
for
the
existence
of
jurisdiction.
i
don't
know
on
what
basis
accardi
took
the
case...
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
certainly
didn't
say
that
there
had
been
a
constitutional
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
accardi
cite
heikkila?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
didn't.
i
have
no
idea
on
what
basis
accardi...
justice
antonin
scalia
took
jurisdiction.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
concede
that
they're
removable
any
more.
they
concede
that
they
are
removable
but
for
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
didn't
take
the
final
step
of
exercising
his
discretion.
what's
your
response
to
that
argument?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
they
are
not
removable
within
the
meaning
of
that
statute
because
the
last
step
hasn't
been
taken?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
refusal
to
grant
a
pardon,
since
you're
analogizing
this...
justice
antonin
scalia
nobody
is
removable
by
reason
of
that
alone.
i
mean,
if
you
take
removable
in
the
broad
sense
to
mean
all
of
the
conditions
have
been
complied
with
to
make
the
removal
proper,
if
you
take
it
in
that
broad
sense,
this
provision
makes
no
sense,
because
in
that
broad
sense,
nobody
is
removable
solely
by
reason
of
having
committed
a
criminal
offense.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
says
that
those
cases
came
out
that
way
simply
because
the
attorney
general
had,
as
a
discretionary
matter,
decided
to
determine
the
discretionary
element
together
with
the
merits
determination,
so
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
happened
to
have
been
preceding
the
order
of
deportation,
but
that
there
was
no
legal
requirement
that
that
be
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
a
regulation
number
for
that,
or...
