mr.
austin
c.
schlick
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
section
1962(c)
reaches
racketeering
activity
by
a
defendant
who
is
employed
by
the
rico
enterprise,
without
regard
to
the
scope
of
the
defendant's
employment.
that
is
clear
from
the
text
of
section
1962(c)
which
reaches
racketeering
activity
by
any
person
employed
by
or
associated
with
any
enterprise.
a
scope
of
employment
rule
defies
that
plain
language.
in
addition,
a
scope
of
employment
rule
is
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
scheme
in
three
additional
respects.
first,
a
scope
of
employment
rule
defies
congress's
intent
to
reach
criminals
who
infiltrate
and
corruptly
run
legitimate
businesses.
it's
important
in
that
respect
to
address
the
question
of
whether
a
criminal
or
otherwise
wrongful
act
can
be
within
the
scope
of
employment.
and
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
it
can
be.
section
231
of
the
restatement
of
agency
addresses
that
point,
but
consider
the
example
of
a
corporation
which
instructs
its
employee
to
make
a
sale,
knowing
that
the
way
that
that
sale
was
made
traditionally
is
through
bribery.
in
that
case,
the
bribery
would
be
within
the
scope
of
employment,
notwithstanding
that
it
would
be
unlawful
and,
notwithstanding,
there
might
not
have
been
specifically
urged
by
the
corporation.
because
of
that,
when
criminals
take
control
of
a
business,
they
are
able
to
bring
illegal
activity
within
the
scope
of
that
business.
and
under
the
second
circuit's
scope
of
employment
rule,
that
would
immunize
the
racketeering
activity.
second,
the
scope
of
employment
rule
would
create
additional
difficulties
in
applying
section
1962(c),
because
the
test
itself
is
contextual
and
subject
to
the
case
specific
application.
this
court
discussed
that
in
faragher
v.
city
of
boca
raton.
the
difficulties
and
the
permutations
of
the
rule.
third,
a
scope
of
employment
limitation
is
inconsistent
with
the
court's
holding
in
reves
that
a
defendant,
under
section
1962(c),
must
participate
in
the
operation
or
management
of
the
affairs
of
the
business.
if
participation
and
operation
and
management
is
necessary
for
there
to
be
liability,
then
carrying
out
the
affairs
of
the
business
cannot
prevent
liability.
an
employee
who
controls
a
corporation
would,
under
that
rule,
be
immune
from
liability
when
he
misuses
his
control
of
the
corporation
to
involve
the
corporation
in
racketeering.
if
the
court
has
no
questions?
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
yes,
justice
o'connor,
the
concern
intuitively
about
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
is
the
predicate
act,
which
is
mail
fraud
or
wire
fraud.
if
you
took
the
same
hypothetical
and
substitute
arson
or
murder
or
narcotics
trafficking
as
the
offense,
i
don't
think
that
anyone
would
be
shocked
or
surprised.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
this
case
goes
to
the
interpretation
of
section
1962,
which
applies
to
criminal
as
well
as
civil
cases.
courts
have
looked
under
section
1964(c)
to
addressing
particular
abuses
in
the
civil
context,
but
what
ever
one
thinks
of
the
allegations
in
this
particular
complaint,
the
core
fact
pattern
which
is
the
running
of
a
business
in
a
pervasively
corrupt
manner
is
exactly
what
congress
intended
to
reach
through
rico.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
justice
kennedy,
it
would
be
possible
to
frame
a
complaint
either
way,
but
the
fact
that--
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
--but
to
do
that,
you
would
be
alleging
two
different
fact
patterns.
suppose
the
corporation
needed
the
personal
assets
of
mr.
king
to
carry
out
its
racketeering
activity.
in
that
case,
it
might
be
possible
to
have
the
corporation
named
as
the
defendant
or
person,
and
mr.
king
as
the
enterprise.
but
that
would
be
a
different
fact
pattern
than
the
one
alleged
here.
it
would
not
be
possible
simply
to
flip
the
defendant
and
the
enterprise
at
will.
mr.
austin
c.
schlick
under
this
fact
pattern,
the
allegation
is
that
mr.
king
has
used
not
only
his
personal
resources
but
also
other
agents,
other
employees,
of
dkp
corporation
to
carry
out
the
racketeering
activity,
so
it
would
be
necessary
to
allege
an
enterprise
that
incorporates
those
persons
or
things
that
are
used
in
the
racketeering.
