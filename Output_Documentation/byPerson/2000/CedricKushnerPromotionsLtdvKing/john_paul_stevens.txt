justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
quickly
for
you
to
comment
on
the
plain
language
argument
of
the
opponent--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
the
language
does
seem
to
read
rather
plainly
in
his
favor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
doesn't
it
make
sense?
any
person...
so
you
get
an
enterprise
that's
violate...
you
know,
meets
all
the
definitions,
and
this
statute
says
any
person
who
participated
as
an
associate
or
employee,
and
that
work
is
covered.
why
doesn't
it
make
sense?
it
says
that
not
only
the
corporation's
liable,
but
the
individuals
who
perform
these
foul
deeds
are
equally
liable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
had
to
be
distinct.
i
mean,
obviously
it's,
one
of
them
is
general
motors,
the
other
is
the
president
of
general
motors.
they're
distinct
people.
why...
why
doesn't
the
plain
language
just
apply?
i
don't
get
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
this
statute
of
this
section
doesn't
purport
to
impose
liability
on
the
enterprise--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
to
impose
liability
on
people
who
work
for
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
going
through
section
(c),
it
doesn't
impose
any
liability
on
the
corporation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
certainly
you're
dead
right
that
section
(c)
does
not
impose
liability
on
the
enterprise.
it's
focused
on
the
persons.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
you
can
really
say
it
eliminates
respondeat
superior.
it
simply
didn't
apply
respondeat
superior
to
the
activities
of
these
individuals
who
are
themselves
violating
the
statute
because
they're
assisting
in
enterprise
doing,
engaged
in
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
answer
to
that
is
very
simple.
the
statute
says
so.
that's
exactly
what
the
statute
says.
it's
true
of
collection
of
an
unlawful
debt.
if
he
collects
the
debt...
we're
interested
in
the
individuals
who
do
these
wrongful
things.
that's
what
the
statute
says.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
it's
absurd
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--rule
of
reason
in
is...
could
be
a
rule
of
reason
under
this
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
problem
with
that
argument
is
that
i
was
involved
in
some
of
these
decisions,
we
thought,
well,
if
we
really
read
it
finely,
congress
will
straighten
it
out
because
they
couldn't
have
meant
this
vast
extent.
but
congress
has
let
it
sit
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
sure,
yeah.
