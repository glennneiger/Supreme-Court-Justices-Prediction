mr.
richard
a.
edlin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
adopting
a
scope
of
employment
test
should
be
rejected
and
reversed
for
three
principal
reasons.
first,
the
scope
of
employment
test
cannot
be
reconciled
with
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
second,
the
decision
below
runs
contrary
to
this
court's
decision
in
reves,
as
well
as
in
turkette
and
as
well
as
in
scheidler.
finally,
the
decision
below
would
unnecessarily
eviscerate
the
ability
of
private
litigants
in
the
government
to
bring
1962(c)
actions.
turning
to
the
first
point,
on
page
one
of--
mr.
richard
a.
edlin
--yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
edlin
your
honor,
the
problem--
mr.
richard
a.
edlin
--i
think
the
problem
with
the
second
circuit's
decisions
is
that
it
does
reach
the
general
problem.
clearly
if
you
have
a
corporation
that
has
many
employees,
and
one
of
the
corporate
employees
is
the
person,
and
the
rest
of
the
corporation
is
the
enterprise,
i
see
no
problem
with
that
case.
i
see
no
problem
with
this
case.
this
case
is
exactly
the
same,
because
the
introduction
of
the
corporate
form
changes
things,
and
whether
it's
a
one
person
corporation
or
a
multiple
person
corporation,
the
issue
is
precisely
the
same.
mr.
richard
a.
edlin
i
think
the
problem
with
the
second
circuit's
decision
is
that
it
may
well
say
the
same
thing.
mr.
richard
a.
edlin
the
problem
that
we
have
with
the
second
circuit's
decision
is
that
it
is
hard
to
rationalize
with
the
meaning
of
the
statute
and
with
the
court's
decision
in
reves.
reves
clearly,
for
example,
confers
liability
on
all
inside
managers.
whatever
else
it
does,
it
certainly
confers
liability
on
all
inside
managers.
there's
no
question
under
reves
that
mr.
king
would
be
included
within
the
operation
and
management
test
that
this
court
adopted
there.
the
second
circuit's
decision
immunizes
precisely
the
same
group
of
people,
or
a
single
person,
that
reves
would
impose
liability
upon.
and
the
second
circuit's
decision
is
not
limited
and
does
not
distinguish
between
corporations
in
which
there
is
one
principal
party
or
corporations
in
which
there
are
many
parties.
i
agree
with
you
the
scope
of
management
test
doesn't
really
work,
but
it's
because
it
doesn't
work.
it's
not
because
the
second
circuit
has
limited
it
to
just
this
fact
item.
mr.
richard
a.
edlin
your
honor,
i--
mr.
richard
a.
edlin
--if
you're
missing
something,
i
am
too,
and
i
am
eager
to
hear
an
answer
from
mr.
fleming
on
that
question.
but
even
beyond
the
corporation,
certainly
rico
reaches
both
legitimate
and
illegitimate
enterprises
and,
in
the
context
of
the
illegitimate
enterprise,
scope
of
employment
analysis
makes
no
sense
at
all.
so
i
just
think
that
when
you
look
at
what
the
second
circuit
is
doing,
it
can't
be
reconciled
with
what
the
words
of
the
statute
said.
the
words
of
the
statute
are
extraordinarily
broad.
this
court
has
had
many
opportunities
to
look
at
this
section
of
the
statute,
and
when
we
look,
for
example,
on
page
one
of
the
blue
brief,
at
the
definitions,
person
includes
any
individual
or
entity,
and
an
enterprise
for
this
purpose
includes
any
corporation.
and
1962(c)
refers
to
any
person
employed
by
an
enterprise.
mr.
richard
a.
edlin
on
these
facts,
i
think
that
that...
you
could
allege
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
that
would
be--
mr.
richard
a.
edlin
--no,
i
don't
think
that
you
can
do
both.
i
don't
think
you
can
set
it
up
and
try
to
have
it
both
ways,
but
i
think--
mr.
richard
a.
edlin
--if
you
chose
just
one.
if
you
had...
if
you
chose
don
king
productions
as
the--
mr.
richard
a.
edlin
--unfortunately,
you
know,
you
might
have
to
do
that
in
the
second
circuit.
i
don't
think
that's
the
way
that
the
statute
is--
mr.
richard
a.
edlin
--on
the
facts
of
this
case,
your
honor,
certainly
the
pleading
that
we
have
in
this
case
satisfies
the
standards
of
the
case.
there's
an
individual,
he
is
conducting
his
affairs
through
a
corporate
enterprise
and
engaging
in
racketeering
activities.
no
question
that
that
pleading
is
appropriate.
now
if
you
flip
it
and
you
had
don
king
productions
conducting
the
affairs
of
don
king,
depending
upon
what
the
facts
were,
that
would
not
violate
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
there
are
contexts
that
one
could
probably
come
up
with
in
which
the
facts
would
justify
that
sort
of
pleading.
in
this
case,
i
think
we've
pled
it
the
right
way.
mr.
richard
a.
edlin
i
think
that
that's
no
doubt
technically
correct,
but
i
don't
think
that's
what
we're
trying
to
do
just
because
you
can
plead
in
the
alternative.
i
don't
think
that
pleading
in
the
alternative
means
that
you
can
plead
wholly
inconsistent
theories
of
facts.
you
can
plead
alternative
results,
but
i
don't
think
that
a
pleading
in
the
alternative
like
this
would
pass
a
motion
simply
because
i
do
think
that
in
terms
of
the
structure
of
the
person
and
the
enterprise,
you
do
have
to
pick
it.
mr.
richard
a.
edlin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
that
case,
a
sole
proprietorship
with
employees
would
be
an
association
in
fact
enterprise
and,
again,
distinct
from
the
person.
so
as
long
as
there
is
no
complete
overlap
between
the
person
and
the
association
in
fact,
those
pleadings
which
are
again
not
at
issue
in
this
case
have
routinely
been
upheld
as
appropriate
pleadings.
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
that
our
circuit
just
got
this
one
wrong,
and
i
think
that
it's
very
simple
to
address
it.
moving
past
the
language
of
the
statute
and
on
toward
the
reves
case,
again
as
i
mentioned
just
a
moment
ago,
reves
carefully
considered
the
appropriateness
of
imposing
liability
upon
employees
or
others
who
were
in
operational
and
management
control
of
the
corporation.
there
is
no
question
that
under
that
test
don
king
would
qualify
as
someone
in
operational
or
management
control
of
this
enterprise,
and
that
is
the
appropriate
standard
to
use
here.
it
is
not
a
scope
of
employment
standard.
reves
is
the
appropriate
standard,
and
under
reves
mr.
king
would
have
liability.
the
second
circuit's
decision
simply
immunizes
that.
the
final
vice
with
the
second
circuit's
decision
goes
toward
the
evisceration
of
1962(c)
actions.
1962(c)
actions,
i
believe...
i
haven't
done
the
math,
but
i
believe
they
are
the
wide
majority
of
rico
claims
that
are
brought.
there
are
many
more
cases
there.
now,
whether
you
take
the
government's
example
of
a--
mr.
richard
a.
edlin
--i
don't,
your
honor.
i
don't
know.
mr.
richard
a.
edlin
your
honor,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
statute
was
targeted
at
organized
crime,
but
there
is
also
little
doubt--
mr.
richard
a.
edlin
--your
honor,
there
is
little
question
that
what
you're
saying
is
true,
except
for
the
fact
that
this
court
has
read
in
sedima
into
the
statute
the
fact
that
it
has
an
extremely
broad
sweep
and
it
catches
precisely
this
kind
of
activity.
congress
made
a
choice
in
unveiling
the
broadest
possible
statute,
that
it
would
err
on
the
side
of
including
these
kinds
of
cases,
possibly
even
shifting
the
burden
to
federal
courts
to
deal
with
these
kinds
of
claims
so
that
loopholes
were
not
created
for
clever
racketeers
to
slip
through
and
avoid
liability.
i
believe
that
that
demonstrates
the
breadth
of
the
statute,
and
if
that
is
a
problem
to
be
remedied
as
this
court
has
observed
on
many
occasions,
it
lies
with
congress.
the
plain
language
of
this
statute
has
been
amply
satisfied
by
this
pleading,
and
i
believe
that
the...
again,
to
my
last
point,
the
problem
with
the
second
circuit
decision
is
that
whether
you
take
the
government's
example
of
the
corporate
president
who
directs
the
company
to
bribe
public
municipalities,
or
whether
you
take
our
example
of
an
organized
crime
family
incorporating
and
appointing
everybody
an
executive
vice
president,
those
two
situations,
under
the
second
circuit
standard,
would
not
be
caught
within
the
scope
of
the
statute,
and--
mr.
richard
a.
edlin
--we
urged
it
in
the
second
circuit.
we
argued
it
extensively
in
the
second
circuit,
and
what
is
interesting
to
me
at
least
in
the
second
circuit's
decision...
there
are
a
couple
of
points
of
interest.
one,
it
did
not
discuss
reves.
second,
it
was
a
panel
of
two
judges
in
the
second
circuit,
but
also
judge
lloyd
george
of
nevada
who,
in
addition
to
presumably
knowing
something
about
boxing,
knows
something
about
the
laws
outside
the
second
circuit
and
how
his
circuit
interprets
this.
a
per
curiam
decision
which
drops
a
very
strong
footnote
in
footnote
4
which...
in
which
the
second
circuit
owns
up
to
the
fact
that
its
decision,
it's
intention,
if
not
direct
conflict,
with
the
laws
of
every
other
circuit
on
this
point,
i
think
demonstrates
in
some
way
that
the
second
circuit
was
inviting
this
certiori.
mr.
richard
a.
edlin
i'm
simply
observing
that
i
found
how
the
court
issued
its
decision
interesting,
given
the
fact
that
it
does
not
mention
reves.
it
is
very
difficult
to
understand
how
this
case,
which
is
so
close
to
reves,
is
not
even
mentioned
in
this
very
short
second
circuit
decision.
and
i
think
the
reason
is
obvious.
it
can't
be
reconciled.
there
is
no
way
to
take
the
facts
of
this
case
and
support
them
under
any
reading
of
reves.
mr.
richard
a.
edlin
justice
breyer,
i
agree
with
that.
however,
this
court
has
rejected
every
instance
in
which
a
circuit
court
has
sought
to
artificially
restrict
the
language
of
the
statute
and
has
observed
that
the
remedy
is
with
congress.
this
statute
was
not
passed
without
congress
observing
that
these
exact
criticisms
were
possible.
it
was
passed
over
opposition.
the
answer
to
the
opposition
was
simply
that
the
protections
of
the
statute
did
not
take
place
in
the
definitional
sections,
it
took
place
in
the
pattern
and
enterprise
sections
so
that
garden
variety
frauds
are
typically
not
committed
with
a
pattern
and
continuity.
mr.
richard
a.
edlin
justice
scalia,
whether
it
is
or
it
isn't,
it
was
considered
by
congress
at
the
time
it
was
passed,
and
congress
made
a
decision
that
it
would--
mr.
richard
a.
edlin
--i'm
trying
carefully
to
say
it's
not
absurd
in
that
example,
but
apparently
it's
hard,
and
i
won't
continue
to
try
to
do
it.
the
fact
is,
though,
that
we
do
have
a
statute.
it's
been
read
by
this
court
a
number
of
times,
it
supports
our
interpretation
of
the
statute.
the
second
circuit's
decision
should
be
reversed,
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
remaining
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
a.
edlin
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
there
are
any
questions,
we
are
prepared
to
waive
rebuttal.
