but...
i
just
want
follow
up
justice
breyer's
question,
in
the
case
of
a
large
corporation,
what
would
the
second
circuit
say?
the
same
thing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--on
these
facts,
could
you
have
alleged
that
king
was
the
enterprise
and
the
corporation
was
the
person?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
could
have
count
one,
where
one
is
the
person,
and
count
two,
and
it's
the
same?
that
seems
rather
odd.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
thought
you
just
indicated
you
could
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
flip
a
coin
to
decide
which
way
you're
going
to
do
the
count?
do
the
pleading?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
under
your
theory.
under
your
theory
you
say
that
you
can
participate
with
your
own
corporation.
i
said
what's
the
difference
between
an
enterprise
and
a
person
on
the
facts
of
this
case?
it
seems
to
me
that
they
could
have
just
been
flipped
around.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
that
this
complaint
could
have
been
just
as
easily
drafted,
switching
the
enterprise
and
the
participant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
mean
prove
the
case
as
well.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
why
not,
under
this
fact
pattern.
