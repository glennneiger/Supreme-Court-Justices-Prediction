mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
this
court--
as
usual,
you
depart
from
what
you're
prepared
to
say.
first,
the
application
of
1962(c)
to
ordinary
business,
is
absurd.
we
do
not
rely
upon
that,
although
we
do
believe
that
if
thinking
along
with
us
the
court
concludes
that
the
second
circuit's
reading
of
1962(c)
and
its
application
is
correct,
the
absurdity
of
the
other
reading
would
lead
acceptance
of
its
result.
mr.
justice
breyer,
our
case
is
not
limited
to
a
single
employee
situation.
it
would
be...
the
second
circuit's
approach
would
be
applicable
if
there
were
five
or
six
employees
or
more.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
and
exempt
under
(c),
but
would
not
exempt
under--
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
--our
position
would
be,
justice
breyer,
that
(a)
covers
that
situation,
and
it
was
congress's
intent
that
(a)
cover
that
situation,
where
the
same
response
to
justice
souter's
question,
and
that
has
to
do
with
whether
any
criminal
act
or
predicate
act
or
civil
fraudulent
act
can
be
considered
within
the
scope
of
employment.
unfortunately,
i
think
experience
shows
that
those...
that
torts
of
that
sort
are
conducted
within
the
scope
of
employment.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
we
do
agree
on
that.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
it
could
be...
it
could
be
to
further
the
interests
of
the
corporation.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
said...
second
circuit
said
in
riverwoods
was
in
the
course
of
their
employment
and
on
behalf
of
the
corporation...
and
on
behalf
of
the
corporation.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
the
court
would...
what
you're
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
if
an
employee
commits
a
tort...
commits
a
fraudulent
act,
it
simply
cannot
be
considered
from
the
scope
of
employment.
i
would
disagree
with
that
if,
in
fact,
he
was
acting
for
the
benefit
of
the
corporation.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
and
we
all
know
what
happens.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
so
long
as
he's
acting
for
the
benefit
of
the
company.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
yes,
i
think
it
does.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
i'm
sorry...
i
misunderstood.
i
thought
what
justice
souter
was
saying
was
that
the
person's
acting
in
his
job...
he
may
be
acting
tortiously
in
his
job,
but
he's
acting
for
the
benefit
of
the
company,
and
i
believe
that
occurs
all
of
the
time,
unfortunately,
and
when
it
does
occur,
it
is
within
the
scope
of
his
employment.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
i
am
in
agreement
with
that.
the
second
circuit's
view
is
very
clear.
they
say,
as
all
the
circuits
say,
that
under
1962(c)
the
rico
person
must
be
distinct
from
the
enterprise,
whatever
that
enterprise
may
be.
they
then
say
that
so
far
as
they
are
concerned,
corporate
employees
working
for
the...
on
behalf
of
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
corporation,
are
not
distinct
from
the
corporation
itself.
we
think
that's
consistent
with
the
traditional
view
of
a
corporation.
there's
the
argument--
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
--if
understand
what
you
said,
justice
o'connor.
you
make
exactly
our
point
about
rico
and
why
the
second
circuit
is
correct.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
the
common
law
provides,
as
the
court
knows,
that
a
corporation
is
liable
certainly
civilly
and
sometimes
criminally
for
the
conduct...
for
the
wrongful
conduct
of
its
employees.
rico
exempts
the
enterprise
from
liability
and
points
to
the
person
only.
we
think
if
you
have
to
look
at
that
issue,
when
you're
asking
yourself
what
congress
was
looking
for
in
1962(c),
we
say
that
because
the
enterprise
is
exempt
from
liability
for
the
wrongful
conduct
of
the
person,
that
can
be
consistent
with
common
law
principles
only
in
that
situation
where
the
corporation
is
exempt
by
common
law.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
all
the
circuits
agree
that
under
1962(c),
there
must
be
the
rico
person...
it
could
be
any
person...
the
rico
person
must
be
distinct
from
the
enterprise.
all
the
circuits
agree
on
that,
and
all
the
circuit...
excuse
me,
justice
ginsburg?
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
not
in...
not
in
the...
in
the
seventh
circuit,
yes.
and
in
another
circuits,
perhaps
yes.
in
the
second
circuit,
no,
if
the
predicate
acts
were
performed
for
the
benefit
of
the
sole
proprietorship.
but
i
agree,
justice
ginsburg,
that
a
sole
proprietorship
with
a
few
employees
is
subject
to
1962(c)
application.
the
question
is
whether
the
second
circuit's
view
of
the
application
of
1962(c)
should
prevail,
or
whether
the
view
of
other
circuits
should
prevail.
the
second
circuit
is
saying
that
corporate
employees
acting
with
the
corporation
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
corporation
are
really
a
part
of
the
corporation
and
are
not
distinct
from
the
corporation
for
the
purposes
of
the
distinctness
required
by
rico.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
against
the
employees.
but
i
think
there
could
be
punishment
of
the
corporation,
and
perhaps
of
the
employees
also,
under
section
a
of
1962,
in
which
the
corporation
is
the
beneficiary
and
can
be
punished.
when
you
look
at
the--
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
--and
for
the
purported
benefit
of
the
corporation.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
but
the
conduct
could
be
reached
under
rico
under
section
(a),
both
as
to
the
corpora...
certainly
as
to
the
corporation,
and
we
believe
also
as
to
the
persons.
and
when
you
look
at
the
entire
statutory
scheme,
you
have
a
situation
where
under
(a)
the
beneficiary
corporation...
what
mr.
blakey
calls
the
perpetrator
corporation...
is
subject
to
rico
liability.
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
when
you
get
to
1962(c),
there
should
be
a
quasi
redundancy,
and
that's
why
the--
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
--our
reply,
your
honor,
is
that
between
one
or
the
other,
ours
is
better.
the
second
circuit--
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
--because
i
believe
the
conduct
that
the
court
describes
can
be
reached,
even
under
rico,
under
other
the
sections
of
rico.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
the...
the...
(a)
is
reprinted
in
gray
brief,
the
amicus
brief,
at
page
4(a).
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
if
i
could,
your
honor,
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person,
so
it
should
be
unlawful
for
any
corporation
which
has
received
any
income
derived
from
a
pattern
of
racketeering
to
employ
that
in
the
operation
of
the
enterprise.
in
the
herako
case,
the
herako
case,
it's
exactly
how
judge
cutahy
harmonized
professor
blakey's
argument
about
perpetrator
corporations.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
yes.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
person
and
enterprise
have
to
be
distinct
under
1962(c).
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
the
courts
say
that
they
can
be
the
same,
but
courts
say
that
(a)
is
a
corporate
beneficiary
rico
statute;
the
perpetrator
corporations--
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
--exactly.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
i
believe
you
can
get
the
individuals
under
(a)
also,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
well,
it's
a
question
of
booking,
i
suppose.
the
difficult
word
there
is
received
which
after
concede,
but
if
the
venal
people
that
justice
breyer
is
describing
are
engaging
in
all
sorts
of
activity
which
is
bringing
income
into
the
organization
or
the
enterprise,
i
believe
they
can
be
captured
under
(a)
also.
the
real
risk
here--
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
i
have
two
points
if
i
could,
justice
stevens.
one
is
any
person,
which
is
what
i
believe
it
says,
is
plain
language,
but
plain
language
which
has
not
made
sense
in
the
application
of
a
statute
has
been
disregarded
by
this
court
where
appropriate.
it
was
just--
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
--it
can...
it
can
be
read
as
literally
meaning
that,
but
there
is
an
inherent
ambiguity
when
you
look
at
the
interpretation
of
1962(c).
the
courts
have
not
only
required
distinctness--
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
--because
the
courts
have
also
held
that
the
enterprise
shall
not
be
liable,
so--
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
--exactly.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
that's
my
point,
if
your
honor
please,
and
if
you
think
about
the
common
law
principles
in
this
court
in
proup
has
said
common
law
does
implicate
the
interpreta...
or
is
implicating
the
interpretation
of
rico,
the
only
time
a
corporation
is
not
financially
liable
for
the
wrongdoing
of
its
employees
is
when
the
employee
is
acting
for
the
employee's
benefit
and
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
corporation,
and
that
is
exactly...
that
is
the
ambiguity
in
this
statute
which
we
think
takes
away
from
applying
meaning.
this
statute
says,
as
interpreted,
says
any
person...
but
it
also
says
the
enterprise
shall
not
be
liable
for
that
person's
conduct,
and
we
believe
the
only
fair
inference
from
that,
which
is
also
consistent
with
what
congress
was
talking
about
overall
and
its
dominant
purpose
of
rico,
the
only
inference
which
can
be
taken
from
that
is
that
congress
intended
the
persons
to
be
liable
when
they
acted
within
a
corporation
for
their
own
personal
benefit.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
said
judicially.
i
can
only
say
that,
judge
scalia.
all
of
the
circuits
in
connection
with
the
distinctness
rule
have
felt
that
the
corporation
shall
not
be...
there
is
no
respondeat
superior
in
rico.
and
that's
how
we
look
at
it--
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
--excuse
me?
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
and
we
think
that
you
have
to
look...
we
think
you
have
to
look
at
that
when
you're
trying
to
say
what
did
congress
mean
here?
you
have
an
(a)
section
which
we
believe
implicates
the
renegade
corporation
and
its
renegade
people.
you
have
association
in
fact
which
was
created
for
the
purpose
of
getting
the
renegade
organization.
you
now
have
(c).
i
think
everyone
agrees
that
(c)
is
absurd
when
it
exposes
all
commercial
america
to
the
threat
of
rico.
we
don't
rely
on
that.
we
don't
think
the
second
circuit
relied
on
that.
i
think
the
secretary
was
saying
a
very
simple
thing.
they
were
saying
when
employees
and
officers
are
working
together
for
the
benefit
of
the
company,
they
happen
to
commit
acts
of
alleged
fraud,
they
are
not
distinct
from
the
company.
they
are
the
enterprise,
and
there
is
no
rico
person.
now,
i
answer
the
plain
language
argument
in
two
ways,
the
sherman
act
said
every
person
who
contracts
and
combines,
and
the
single
actor
model
is
imposed
upon
that
quite
correctly.
i
look
not
only
at
that,
but
i
also
look
at
what
i've
just
described,
and
that
is
the
absence
of
derivative
liability.
you
cannot
properly
interpret
this
statute
and
its
application
without
considering
why
congress
targets
a
person
employed
but
eliminates
respondeat
superior.
the
only
time
at
common
law
where
that
occurs,
we
think
you
have
to
presume
that
congress
acts
with
a
view
toward
the
common
law
is
when
the
person
acting--
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
--our
position...
we
believe
the
second
circuit's
position
is
that
the
individual
who's
targeted
under
1962(c)
is
like
the
infiltrator.
he
happens
to
be
in
the
corporation,
and
he
acts
for
his
own
benefit.
and
we
think
that's
totally
consistent...
i
really,
you
now,
i
read
the
book
and
said
never
ask
the
court
a
question
so
i
will
not,
but
i
think
we
have
to
consider
this...
is
it
conceivable...
is
it
conceivable
that
congress
intended
the
absurdity
that
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
with
regard
to
the
application
of--
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
--because
there
the
corporation
is
corrupt.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
all
right.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
no,
i
think
probably
not.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
i
think
not.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
i
think
(a)
looks
more
at
the
corrupt
enterprise,
and
i
think
we
will
all
accept
the
idea
that
corrupt
enterprise
is
a
potential
rico
target.
you
know,
we're
not
talking
about
a
no
liability
situation
when
we
eliminate
some...
when
you
protect...
when
there
is
some
protection
afforded
under
1962(c).
if
there
is
anything
to
mr.
kushner's
claims,
he
has
single
damage
remedy
against
not
only
mr.
king
individually,
but
don
king
productions.
it
also,
you
know,
when
i,
you
know,
i
think
we
have
to
ask
this
question,
unless
the
individual...
the
person
who
is
the
target
of
1962(c)
is
a
person
who
has
been
acting
for
his
own
personal
benefit
and
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
corporation,
unless
he's
that
person,
why
should
that
person
be
subjected
to
treble
damages
for
his
conduct?
put
it
another
way,
if
that
person
engaging
in
tortious
conduct
on
behalf
of
his
company...
on
behalf
of
his
company...
why
should
that
person
be
target
for
treble
damage
liability
when
the
company's
liability...
the
beneficiary...
is
limited
to
single?
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
don't
believe
that--
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
--we've
been
sitting
around
here
for
a
month,
and
we've
asked
ourselves
what
happens
if
we
are
asked
doesn't
the
statute
say
exactly
that?
and
we
say
in
a
sense...
in
a
sense--
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
--in
a
sense
it
does,
but
we
believe
that
the
exemption
from
corporate
liability
introduced
an
ambiguity
which
does
not
allow
a
plain
language
reading.
second,
you
know,
this
court...
this
court
in
copperweld
said
every
person
does
not
mean
every
person.
in
pierson
it
said
any
person
except
a
judge
because
it
implicated
the
common
law.
in
the
bach
laundry
case,
defendant
was
defined
as
any
party.
i
think
justice
scalia
defined
it
as
a
criminal
defendant
in
a
concurring
opinion.
in
42
u.s.c.
1985,
which
is
conspiracy
to
violate
civil
rights,
a
number
of
dist...
a
number
of
circuit
courts
and
district
courts
have
held
that
two
or
more
persons
does
not
mean
two
or
more
persons
if
they're
employed
by
the
corporation.
so
this
single
actor...
this
unity
of
conduct
which
the
second
circuit
focused
upon...
is
not
foreign
to
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court,
and
we
believe
it
is
the
only
appropriate
way
to
harmonize
the
absurdity
of
this
statute
applied
on
a
plain
language
basis,
and
rico's
purpose
of
punishing
the...
call
them
racketeer...
person
engaging
in
racketeering
and,
in
this
case,
the
quasi
infiltrator,
the
employee
who
goes
bad
and
uses
his
job
as
a
means
of
feathering
his
nest.
the
department
talks
about...
solicitor
general,
i'm
sorry.
i'm
always
used
to
saying
the
department.
the
solicitor
general
says
they
need
rico
to
get
unions...
to
bring
injunctive
action
against
unions.
think
of
that.
what
they
are
trying
to
do
is
to
get
rid
of
the
union
officers
who,
at
the
expense
of
the
corporation,
are
feathering...
stuffing
their
own
pockets,
feathering
their
own
nests.
we
think
that's
what
congress
was
looking
at
when
it's
talking
about
1962(c),
and
the
one
thing
we
surely
think
congress
was
not
looking
at
was
ibm
against
ibm,
which
is
the
effect
of
the
any
person
analysis.
a
question
was
asked
about
the
use
of
it;
i
think
in
the
sedima
case,
we
do
not
have
the
appropriate,
we
did
not
get
the
up
to
day
statistics.
in
the
sedima
case,
the
aba
reportedly
cited
that
said
that
nine
percent...
nine
percent
of
the
civil
1962(c)
lawsuits
were...
had
to
do...
had
anything
to
do
with
organized
crime,
and
the
other
ninety
one
percent
were
commercial
disputes.
i
go
back
to
justice
marshall's
dissent
in
sedima,
as
i
go
back
to
justice
marshall
in
the
second
circuit.
i
think
there
is
another
consideration
which
he
posed.
the
broad
application
of
1962(c)
for
which
they
contend
is
based
principally,
if
not
entirely,
upon
a
quote,
unquote,
plain
language,
with
all
respect,
justice
stevens,
with
no
real
analysis
and
no
answer
to
all
to
our
point
with
regard
to
the
absence
of
true
liability.
no
answer
at
all.
the
application
of
their
quote,
unquote,
plain
language
approach
in
essence
does
turn
federal
jurisdiction
on
its
head
because
not
only
do
you
have
people
being
threatened
with
treble
damage
liability
where
that
should
not
exist,
but
you
have
federal
jurisdiction
being
obtained
where
everything
else
lacking,
you're
in
state
court
in
a
common
law
fraud
case,
or
in
this
case
in
a
supposed
tortious
interference
with--
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
--am
i
allowed
to...
am
i
allowed
to
comment
on
what
congress
will
straighten
out?
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
they
took
out
securities
fraud,
and
i
assume
that's
because
there
is
a
strong
securities
fraud
lobby.
mail
and
wire
fraud
will
never
disappear
from
this
statute,
never.
first
of
all,
it's
needed
for
criminal
purposes,
so
it
will
never
disappear
as
a
predicate
act.
mr.
peter
fleming,
jr.
i
saw
it.
thank
you.
