justice
david
h.
souter
in
any
case,
i
was
going
to
ask
basically
the
same
question.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
scope
of
management
test
includes
at
least,
as
i
assume
it
must,
some
reference
to
the
purposes
of
the
corporation,
then
no
corporation,
whether
it's
a
regular
corporation
or
a
pure
formality,
can
be
organized
as
a
matter
of
law
to
commit
acts
of
racketeering.
so
the
odd
thing
to
me
about
the
second
circuit's
opinion
is
the
notion
that
one
would
be
within
the
scope
of
employment
while
engaging
in
the
prohibited
activities.
and
i
would
have
thought
that
that
was
a
legal
impossibility.
am
i
missing
something?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
should
ask
your
opponent
that
question,
but
just
to
stir
him
up--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that...
that's
an
easy
conclusion
to
draw
if
your
sole
test
of
scope
of
employment
is
intent
to
benefit
the
corporation,
but
the
scope
of
employment
inquiry
is
broader
than
that
and,
even
apart
from
the
fact
that
there's
always
a
policy
component
to
it,
you've
got
to
take
into
consideration
in
some
way
corporate
purpose,
and
i
take
it
we
at
least
have
common
ground
that
there
is
no...
there
is
not
state
corporation
law
that
would
charter
a
corporation
to
commit
within
the
scope
of
its
corporate
authority
an
act
of
racketeering.
we
agree
on
that,
don't
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
and
if
that
has
got
to
be
considered
then
in
determining
what
can
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
employment
of
an
employee
or
an
officer,
then
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
how
any
act
of
the
officer
could,
under
state
corporation
law,
be
within
the
scope
of
his
employment
because
it
can't
be
within
the
scope
of
the
corporate
purpose.
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
but
that's
true
only
if
that's
your
sole
test
of
scope
of
employment,
and
if
that's
going
to
be
the
case,
it
would
just,
it
seems
to
me,
make
for
clearer
thinking
if
we
didn't
talk
about
scope
of
employment
and
instead
said,
look,
the
test
is
whether
it's
to
further
the
financial
interest
of
the
corporation.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i'm
suggesting
that
you
can't
have
both.
you
might
have
a
subjective
purpose
to
bring
lucre
to
the
corporation,
but
i
don't
see
how
as
a
matter
of
law
to
be
within
the
scope
of
employment,
too.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
then
scope
of
employment
then
turns--
justice
david
h.
souter
--then
scope
of
employment,
in
effect,
is
going
to
be
limited
in
this
context
to
serving
a
corporate
purpose
in
the
sense
of
trying
to
bring
monetary
gain
to
the
corporation.
that
is
the
sole
test.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
think
the...
i
don't
want
to
take
more
of
your
time
on
this
than
this
last
question,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
way
the
circuit
was
referring
to
the
test,
it
was
confining
the
test
to
this
one
element.
was
it
trying
to
further
the
financial
interest
of
the
corporation.
whether
we
as
lawyers
or
judges
would
come
up
with
a
different
test
for
that
phrase,
i
don't
know.
but
that
seems
to
be
the
one
criterion
that
the
circuit
was
applying,
and
i
thought
that's
what
you
were
agreeing
to.
