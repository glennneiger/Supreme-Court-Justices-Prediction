any
idea
what
percentage
of
them
really
pick
up
organized
crime,
which
is
supposedly
the
object
of
rico?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
that
would
be
a
more
interesting
statistic
as
far
as
whether
your
interpretation
really
fulfills
the
purpose
of
rico.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
and
all
your
statistic
may
prove
is
that
the
statute
is
being
used
excessively
for
a
purpose
that
it
did
not
have
in
mind
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
no...
that's
no
protection
in
the
hypothetical
that
justice
breyer
gave
you.
i
mean,
you
have
one
salesman
who
steps
over
the
line
a
couple
of
times,
and
suddenly
you're...
you're...
the
corporation
is
into
rico.
i
mean,
that's
totally
absurd.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
don't
tell
me
it's
not
absurd.
say
you
know
it's
absurd,
but
that's
what
congress
provided.
i
thought
you
were
trying
to
say
it's
not
absurd.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
think
you
have
to
disagree
with
that.
and
i
think
you
would
say
that
a
corporate
charter
cannot,
certainly
under
any
state
law
that
i'm
aware
of,
authorize
the
corporation
to
act
negligently
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
nonetheless,
when
a...
or
willfully
negligent,
either.
and
nonetheless,
when
a
corporate
officer
does
that,
he's
deemed
to
be
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
you
wouldn't
say
that's
the
sole
test,
mr.
fleming.
surely
if
somebody
is
a
lineman
for
a
telephone
company
and
he
does
some
act
that,
you
know,
that
is
an
act
only
appropriate
for
the
vice
president,
you
wouldn't
say
he's
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment.
it
has
to
be
somehow
within
the
assigned
job
that
the
individual
has
been
given,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
it
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
you're
saying
it's...
it's
using
the
income
in
the
operation
of
its
own
enterprise?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
thought
you
say
that
person
and
enterprise
have
to
be
distinct.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
you
say
for
(a)
they
can
be
the
same.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
can
get
the
corporation
because
it
makes
the
income
and
invests
it
in
its
own
operations.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
individuals?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how?
they're
not
getting
the
income.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
it
say
that
the
corporation
shall
not
be
liable
for
that
person's
conduct?
