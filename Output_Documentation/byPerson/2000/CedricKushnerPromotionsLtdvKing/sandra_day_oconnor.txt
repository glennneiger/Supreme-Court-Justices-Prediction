do
you
see
any
way
to
limit
the
application
of
rico
to
the
situations
described
by
justice
breyer?
it
is
a
little
far
afield
from
its
ostensible
purpose.

the
thing
that
strikes
me
as
a
little
bit
odd
about
the
scope
of
employment
test
is
that
the
scope
of
employment
in
reves
is
one
we
usually
make
as
relevant
to
whether
the
employer
is
liable,
and
it's
not
the
inquiry
we
make
when
we're
looking
to
see
if
the
employee
is
liable,
and
i
just
don't
see
how
the
test
quite
fits.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
wouldn't
think
so.
i
didn't
make
the
point
for
that
purpose.
