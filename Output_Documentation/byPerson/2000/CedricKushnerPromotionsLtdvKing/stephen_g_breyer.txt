justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
tell
me
something,
before
you
get
into
this,
i
would
appreciate
your
correcting
the
following
misapprehension,
if
it
is,
or
affirming
it.
this
is
my
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--are
we
talking
about
only
a
really
odd
situation?
a
situation
where
we're
talking
about
one
individual?
because
if
there
are
several
individuals
in
a
corporation,
there
really
is
no
problem
that
this
act
clearly
applies,
but
we're
only
talking
about
a
circumstance
where
there's
just
like
one
person.
is
there
a
general
aspect--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
what
we're
talking
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that's
what
i
didn't
see
because
it
seemed
to
me
in
any
real
corporation
it's
not
going
to
be
following
what
the
corporation
wants
to
commit
a
crime,
so
it's
not
in
the
scope
of
your
employment
to
commit
a
crime.
and
so
under
the
second
circuit's
rule,
unless
you're
suddenly...
unless
we're
talking
about
a
corporation
that
wants
to
go
off
and
commit
crimes,
the
person's
never
going
to
be
acting
in
the
scope
of
his
employment,
so
always
he's
caught
within
the
statute.
if
there's,
you
know,
several
people,
certainly.
am
i
right?
can
you
explain
that
very
clearly?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
suppose
that
what
they're
worried
about,
if
i'm
trying
to
imaginatively
put
myself
in
their
shoes,
is
that
a
person
could
claim
the
following.
take
any
company
whatsoever
that
does
business
in
interstate
commerce,
and
the
plaintiff
says
there's...
there's
a
manager
in
that
company
who,
on
a
couple
of
occasions,
at
least
two,
told
the
salesmen
to
overstate
or
to
lie
about
a
characteristic
of
the
product.
that's
it.
and
now
all
of
those
become
rico
violations
because
it
is
claimed
that
this
person,
you
see,
is
engaging
or
participating
in
the
affairs
of
american
express
company
or
any
other
large
company,
through
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity,
i.e.
two
instances
of
mail
fraud.
and
that's
so
distant
from
the
purposes
of
this
statute
that
they're
searching
for
ways
to
limit
the
scope.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that
isn't
the
problem.
the
question
i
think
is...
is
there
anything,
any
judicial
interpretation,
because
mail
fraud
is
one
of
the
predicate
acts,
isn't
it?
we're
not
a
legislature.
i
mean,
so
the
question
is,
is
there
some
area
in
this
which
would
be
an
interpretation
that
brings
it
closer
to
the
basic
congressional
intent
which
is
just
as
you
describe,
to
get
organized
crime
people
the
bad
things,
but
not
sweep
in
so
many
things.
or
this
simply
a
question
of
that's
how
the
legislation
was
drafted,
put
up
with
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
that's
their
concern,
because
if
that's
right,
then
the
one
time
when
the
interest
of
the
employee
committing
the
crime
and
the
interest
of
the
corporation
are
likely
to
be
congruent
is
where
you
have
an
evil
corporation,
and
that
seems
to
be
the
one
time
that
clearly
the
second
circuit
rule
would
exempt
from
the
statute,
and
so
oddly
enough,
insofar
as
it
has
an
impact,
its
impact
is
bad
in
terms
of
the
statutory
purpose.
that's
the
argument
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
but
insofar
as
the
second
circuit
rule
has
real
has
real
bite
beyond
a
single
person,
its
bite
is
biting
the
person...
in
other
words,
bite
goes
just
in
the
wrong
direction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
that
(a)
is
about...
is
investing
racketeering
proceeds
in
an
enterprise,
and
(b)
is
about
obtaining
control,
and
(c)
is
about
managing
the
enterprise
or
participating
in
its
affairs
through
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
they
seem
different.
so
i
thought
that...
imagine
the
case
where
you
have
a
group
of
racketeers...
i
mean,
let's
call
them
really
bad
people,
all
right?
the
really
bad
people
in
fact
created
or
are
found
in
positions
of
responsibility
in
an
enterprise,
and
what
they
do
is
they
have
a
series
of
really
bad
acts.
so
we
get
that
out
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
these
are
really
bad
people,
they
have
a
lot
of
really
bad
acts,
so
they're
just
the
people
that
(c)
wants,
and
you
write
them
out,
because
after
all
they
are
not
going
against,
they
are
even
furthering
what
the
enterprise
is
there
for.
now,
that's
what
they
say.
now,
you
say,
which
may
be
true,
if
their
interpretation
is
right
and
the
legal
distinctness
consists
of
either
(a)
legal
distinctness,
or
(b)
factual
distinctness,
the
distinctness
requirement
is
always
satisfied
but
for
the
fact
that
where
there
is
a
single
person,
and
he
doesn't
even
work
through
a
corporation.
so
you
say
that
meets
it
meaningless.
now,
they
say
between
the
two,
theirs
is
better.
all
right?
so
what's
your
reply
to
that,
because
they
say
that
there
should
be
limitations?
there
are
other
words
in
the
statute
to
do
it,
not
this
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
that's
what
you
think,
but
at
the
moment
i
would
say
given
the
fact
that
your
interpretation
takes
it
out
of
the
heartland
where
it
should
apply,
why
isn't
theirs
better?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
do
you
get
it
under
(a),
because
i
thought
(a)
was
about
investing
in
an
enterprise,
and
i'm
assuming--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
it
talks
about
investing
the
income
or
part
of
the
proceeds.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
have
the
same
doctrine
in
(a).
i
mean,
on
your
reading
of
(a),
whatever
we
do
about
(c),
exactly
the
same
thing
would
happen.
my
example...
why
wouldn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no.
no,
going
back
to
the
first
example
of
the
bank
that
has
the
supervisor
with
the
two...
i
mean,
by
innocent
example.
the
innocent
example,
you
get...
there...
you
see,
there
were
two
instances
of
exaggerating
or
lying
about
the
qualities
of
our
vacuum
cleaner.
we
said
it
picked
up
mice
and
it
doesn't.
thy
don't
fit
through
the
hole.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so
now
twice
they've
said
that,
and
it
was
planned,
and
of
course
they
sold
two
vacuum
cleaners
as
a
result,
and
they
obtained
a
thousand
dollars
for
that,
and
the
money
was
thereby
obtained
through
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity,
and
they
used
that
thousand
dollars
to
pay
expenses
of
the
corporation,
etcetera,
and
therefore
it
was
used
in
the
operation
of
the
enterprise.
so
all
the
absurdities
are
just
as
great
in
(a)
as
they
are
in
(c).
now,
am
i
right
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
the
second
case,
kushner
promotions
v.
king,
involves
rico,
the
racketeer
influenced
and
corrupt
organizations
act.
now,
this
provision
here
makes
it
“unlawful
for
a
person”
who
is
employed,
by
or
and
associated
with
an
“enterprise”
to
use
the
enterprise
to
commit
what
rico
calls
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
in
this
case,
one
boxing
promoter,
cedric
kushner
promotions
sued
a
different
boxing
promoter,
don
king
claiming
that
king
was
the
person
who
used
an
enterprise
namely
his
company
called
don
king
productions
to
engage
in
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
without
deciding
whether
the
allegations
were
true
or
not
true,
the
lower
court
dismissed
the
complaint
because
king
as
president
and
sole
shareholder
of
don
king
productions
was
not
in
its
view
separate
enough
from
the
corporation
which
was
the
enterprise.
it
pointed
out
that
lower
courts
have
required
that
there
would
be
some
distinctness
between
the
person
and
the
enterprise
when
a
plaintiff
brings
an
action
under
this
provision
of
rico.
now,
in
this
case
we
consequently
have
to
decide
two
questions:
one,
whether
this
rico
provision
does
require
two
separate
entities,
a
person
and
a
distinct
enterprise,
and
two,
if
so,
whether
there
is
enough
distinctness
in
this
case
given
the
closed
relationship
between
don
king
and
his
enterprise
don
king
productions.
the
lower
courts
held
that
there
was
a
distinctness
requirement.
we
agree
with
that,
in
fact,
every
appellate
court
that
has
considered
this
question,
agrees
with
that.
we
explain
it
some
length
in
our
opinion
that
both
the
language
of
the
provision
and
its
basic
purpose
support
our
interpretation.
the
harder
question
is
whether
the
rico
enterprise
and
rico
person
are
here
distinct.
we
find
contrary
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
but
they
are
sufficiently
distinct.
as
we
have
noted,
king
is
the
president
and
sole
shareholder
of
don
king
productions.
the
plaintiff
says
that
while
working
as
the
president
of
that
company,
he
engaged
in
the
unlawful
pattern.
the
court
of
appeals
focused
on
the
fact
that
the
allegations
related
to
actions
taken
by
king
were
within
the
scope
of
his
corporate
employment.
in
this
situation,
according
to
that
court,
the
employee
and
the
employer
are
essentially
the
same
not
distinct.
we
disagree.
in
law
of
course,
a
corporate
owner,
a
corporate
employee;
a
natural
person
is
distinct
from
the
corporation
itself
which
is
a
legally
different
entity
with
different
rights
and
responsibilities.
we
can
find
nothing
in
the
statute
that
requires
any
more
separateness
than
that.
linguistically
speaking
an
employee
like
king
who
conducts
the
affairs
of
the
corporation
through
illegal
acts
comes
within
the
terms
of
the
statute
that
forbids
any
person
unlawfully
to
conduct
an
enterprise
particularly
given
the
acts
expensive
definitions
of
person
and
enterprise.
we
also
find
that
the
application
of
rico
in
these
circumstances
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
statute’s
basic
purposes
as
we
have
previously
defined
them
namely
preventing
the
victimization
of
legitimate
organizations
and
protecting
the
public
from
persons
who
would
use
an
enterprise
as
a
vehicle
for
unlawful
activity.
the
court
of
appeals
formulation
we
fear
would
contravene
statute’s
basic
purposes.
we
therefore
reverse
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
our
decision
is
unanimous.
