but
as
far
as
pleading
is
concerned,
the
rules
allow
you
to
plead
in
the
alternative,
and
you
don't
have
to
pick
your
theory
at
the
pleading
stage,
so
i
guess
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy
means
that
in
your
complaint
you
could
have
alleged
it
both
ways
and
then
waited
to
pick
until
later
on.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
need
a
corporation
on
your
theory?
i
mean,
i
was
reading
your
presentation
and
i
had
the
notion
that
it
wouldn't
matter
if
it
were
a
sole
proprietorship.
at
least
if
it
had
employees,
the
sole
proprietorship
could
be
the
enterprise
and
king
could
be
the
person.
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
could
have
a
sole
proprietorship
that
has
some
employees,
and
that
would
satisfy
the
distinctiveness
requirement,
would
it
not?
because
as
long
as
it
wasn't
just
the
one
person
operation
with
no
employees,
so
you
don't
have
to
have
another
form.
you
could
be
operating
a
sole
proprietorship
and
still
meet
the
distinctiveness
requirement,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
united
states
is
one
example
where
the
second
circuit
position
would
meet,
and
it
says
here's
a
corporation,
tells
its
employees
go
out
and
bribe
the
local
police,
it
will
be
able
to
do
this,
that,
or
the
other
thing,
and
they
won't
touch
us.
those
employees
who
are
giving
the
bribe
then
are
acting
in
the
scope
of
their
employment
for
the
benefit
of
the
corporation,
and
under
your
theory,
there
would
be
no
rico
claim.
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
would
be,
i
suppose,
could
make
a
criminal
bribery
case,
but
as
far
as
1962(c),
on
your
theory,
such
a
pattern
would
not
fit
because
it
was
within
the
scope
of
their
employment
to
give
out
these
sweeteners.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
