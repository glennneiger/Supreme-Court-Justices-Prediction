justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in...
in...
suppose
that
a
stranger
goes
into
your
house,
trespassing,
puts
his
ear
to
the
bedroom
door
and
hears
your
private
conversation
or
goes
in
and
steals
your
diary
and
turns
it
over
to
a
newspaper,
knowing
all
this
publishes
it,
is
it
constitutional
not
to
forbid
the
publication,
but
to
collect
damages
from
the
newspaper?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
it
does.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
you're
saying
that
its
unconstitutional
to
prohibit
trespassers
from
coming
into
your
house,
steal
your
diaries,
and
listen
to
your
most
private
conversations
and
then
publish
them
in
mass
circulation
dailies
and
you
can't
get
damages
from
that
as
long
as
the
newspaper
itself
didn't
do
the
trespass,
just
knew
all
about
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
not
a...
is
not
a
reporter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
just
someone...
it's
a
stranger.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
asking
if
you
can
get
damages
from
the
newspaper
and
i
think
your
answer
straightforwardly
is
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
i
don't
see
how
you're
going
to
have
privacy
left.
i
mean,
what
kind
of
privacy
is
there
if
people
can
break
into
your
house,
steal
all
your
information,
can
be
published
in
the
newspaper
that
knows
it
and
you
can't
get
any
damages
from
the
newspaper?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
goes
with
trade
secrets,
copyrighted
books
and
your
most
private
information.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
but
we
don't
know
who
that
person
is,
you
know.
he
takes
his
money
and
runs,
all
right.
so
the
only
effective
redress
is
to
stop
the
entire
united
states
from
knowing
your
most
secret
information
or
your
trade
secrets
or
your
copyrighted
book
which
was
obtained
with
the
newspaper's
full
knowledge
through
trespass,
breaking
and
entering,
any
kind
of
stealing
you
want.
is
that
not
your
position?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
i
disagree
with
that
you
lose--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no.
no.
i'll
take
it
out
then.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
given
that,
then
why
is
it
worse?
why
is
it
worse
to
receive
a
stolen
diary
than
to
steal
the
diary
yourself?
why
is
it
worse
to
receive
with
knowledge,
the
stolen
diary?
do
you
see
my
point?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
is
it
a
fact--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
might
be
quite
difficult.
is
the...
i
think
that
the
congress
or
states
pass
property
laws
in
part
to
keep
people
away
from
my
bedroom.
and
they
are
doing
that
in
part
for
reasons
better
than
trade
secret
law
or
copyright
law
because
there
is
something
about
human
dignity
that
requires
it.
well,
if
they
can
keep
people
away
from
my
bedroom
to
hear
my
private
conversations,
even
about
important
matters,
can't
they
try
to
protect
that
same
kind
of
basic
dignity
in
respect
to
the
new
world
that
will
come
through
wireless
communication?
now,
do
you
see
there's
a
lot
involved
there,
but
that's
at
the
bottom
of
what
i'm
trying
to
work
out
in
this
case.
