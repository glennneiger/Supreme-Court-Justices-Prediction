mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
perhaps
i'll...
i've
had
enough
questions
in
the
first
15
minutes
to
keep
me
fully
occupied--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
would
welcome
any
and
all
questions
as
always.
i
want
to
start
first
by...
i
do
want
to
address
the
pentagon
papers
point
and
the
point
that
justice
kennedy
made
about
using
information
obtained
on
the
radio
to
talk
with
his
own
wife
or
make
his
own
decisions
and
justice
o'connor's
question
about
what
difference
does
it
make
how
you
get
it.
i
first
want
to
make
the
point
because
there
is
been
some
suggestion
i
think
here
that
it
is
the
government's
position
that
the
first
amendment
does
not...
the
first
amendment
interests
here
don't
require
heightened
scrutiny.
that's
not
our
position.
we
do
recognize
that
there
is
an
important
burden
on
first
amendment
rights
here,
but
we
submit
that
the
appropriate
level
of
scrutiny
is
intermediate
level
scrutiny
because
this
is
a
totally
content
neutral
law
of
general
applicability
that
protects
fundamental
values
of
privacy
and
private
speech
and
denies
third
parties
nothing
that
they
otherwise
would
have
had
if
the
act's
prohibition
on
interception
itself
was
fully
effective--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
think
that
is
so
here,
and
i
also
think
that
that
is
not
an
accurate
characterization
of
all
the
intermediate
scrutiny
cases.
i
mean,
it
was
not
true,
for
example,
in
cohen
v.
cowles
media
or
in
zacchini
and
harper
&
row.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
exactly
right
and
that's--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--right.
and
that's
why...
that's
why
we
think
that
unlike
cohen
v.
cowles
media
where
the
court
applied
no
heightened
first
amendment
scrutiny
and
the
dissenters
objected
on
that
ground,
we
think
that
heightened
scrutiny
is
appropriate
here,
because
there
is
a
restraint
on
speech.
but
it
is
not
a
restraint
on...
with
respect
to
any
topic,
any
viewpoint,
any
speaker.
if
these...
anybody
who
gets
wire
tapped
information
or
information
from
a
bug
planted
in
my
home
or
my
conference
room...
gets
the
information
otherwise,
the
identical
information
is
fully
available
for
speech
or
other
use.
in
other
words,
what's
missing
here--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
is
absolutely
true
and
that
is
why
heightened
scrutiny
applies.
it
is
our
submission
that
it's
significant
that
if
the
same
information
comes
from
any
other
source,
it
can
be
used
or
disseminated
with
impunity
which
is
another
way
i
think,
of
what
i'm
trying
to
suggest,
which
is
that
there
is
no
suggestion
here,
unlike
the
pentagon
papers
case,
or
the
florida
star
line
of
cases
of
a
censorial
motive
by
the
government,
an
effort
to
take
certain
facts
off
the
table,
and
the
reason
that
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
kennedy,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
we
win
because
intermediate
level
scrutiny
applies.
i
have
three
reasons
that
i'd
like
to
articulate
why
we
think
we
do,
but
i
certainly
acknowledge
the
fact
that
the...
a
restriction
on
speech
under
intermediate
level
scrutiny
may
fail
just
as
heightened
scrutiny
like
in
cases
like
bursen
v.
freeman
and
austin
v.
michigan
chamber
of
commerce
can
sometimes
prevail.
my
point
here
is,
and
this
goes
to
the
distinction
with
the
pentagon
papers
case
and
i
think
to
justice
o'connor's
initial
question
about
why
we
should
care
how
the
information
came
to
be,
is
that
the
knowing
use
of
illegally
intercepted
private
expression
implicates
other
constitutional
values
as
this
court
recognized
in
cox
and
florida
star
and
in
particular
the
distinction
between
information
that
is
leaked
from
the
government
or
otherwise
that
is
leaked
as
the
result
of
a
failure
of
a
trusted
responsibility,
which
was
at
issue
in
florida
star
and
perhaps
at
issue
in
landmark
and
certainly
was
at
issue
in
the
pentagon
papers
case,
where
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
that
in
that
instance,
where
we're
talking
about
information
that
was
not
unlawfully
obtained,
but
instead
was
disclosed
to
the
public
as
a
result
of
a
failure
of
a
trust
relationship,
there
is
quote,
almost...
there
are
almost
always
less
drastic
means
of
resolving
the
problem,
both
because
you
can
be
more
careful
about
who
you
trust,
and
secondly,
there
is
a
much
smaller
universe
of
potential
violators.
here
we're
talking
about
an
interception
which
almost
by
definition
is
impossible
of
detection.
people
don't
even
know
that
their
conversations
at
home
or
at
work
are
being
overheard,
let
alone
who
did
it
and
this
case
is
a
perfect--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
don't
think...
i
do
understand
your
point
justice
kennedy,
i
would
quarrel
with
your
characterization
of
this
as
tainted
speech
that
you
can't
do
anything
about.
again,
because
it
doesn't
look
at
the
topic
or
the
subject
or
anything.
it
simply
says
that
if
you
know
that
this
is
the
result
of
an
illegal
intrusion
into
a
zone
of
conversational
privacy,
you
cannot
use
it
until
it
becomes
publicly
known.
and
i
also...
i'm
not
sure
that
it
is
fair
to
say
that
there
is
no
precedent
for
taking
speech
like
this
off
the
table.
i
think
we
have
talked
about
seattle
times
and
cowles
and
harper
&
row
and
zacchini
but
there
is
also
the
san
francisco
arts
case
involving
use
of
the
word
olympic.
there
is
trade
secret
law
which
relates
to
fact
and
not
expression.
there
are
grand
jury
secrecy
rules
and
rules
under
the
conic
pickering
test
about
what
employers--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--and
employees
may
or
may
not
say.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
think
that
that's
wrong;
that
is
the
scarcity
of
cases
shows
it
because
if
you
look
at
the
cases,
for
example,
that
are
reprinted
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief
and
in
respondent
vopper's
brief,
a
very
large
number
of
those
cases
involved
use...
at
least
if
you
take
out
the
marital
cases...
involved
use
by
third
persons,
and
the
deterrence
or
disincentive
point
which
is
one
of
the
three
points
that
we
make
support
the
importance
of
the
use
and
disclosure
provisions
as
a
means
of
protecting
conversational
privacy,
i
think,
depends
just
by
the
way
just
as
the
statute's
exclusionary
rule
in
2515
does,
it
depends
on
the...
the
common
sense
point
that
if
you
prohibit
all
means
of
exploiting
stolen
information,
whether
they
are
expressive
means
or
not,
you
will
lessen
the
incentive
materially
for
many
people
to
engage
in
the
interception.
now,
it's
true
there
will
be
people
who
as
a
hobby
just
like
to
eavesdrop
or
intercept
other
people's
conversations
and
the
use--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
we
think,
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief
that
both
the
meaning
of
the
word
disclose
which
is
in
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history
demonstrates
that
the
statute
no
longer
applies
once
it
is
public
information
or
common
knowledge.
and
we
also
think...
we
also
think
that...
well,
that's
our
answer
with
respect
to
how
far
it
goes,
and
it
would
also
be
an
answer
to
justice
kennedy--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--excuse
me?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
the...
the
statute
precludes
that
use
of
it.
it's
not
addressed
in
this
case,
but
the
statute
precludes
all
use
of
it.
now--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--now,
if
there
was--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well
i...
there
has
never
been
a
case,
a
reported
case
which
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--there
has
never
been
a
reported
case
in
which
there
was
either
a
prosecution
or
a
civil
suit
brought
here,
and
of
course
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
did
not
sue
the
school
board
members
that
were
told
about
it.
but
the
point
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
what
congress
was
trying
to
protect
here
was
not
private
facts
and
not
to
restrain
speech
on
its
own,
but
to
protect
the
sanctity
of
what
we
all
know
to
be
critical
to
our
society,
which
is
the
ability
to
speak
in
an
uninhibited
candid
fashion.
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
questions
about
the
extent
of
the
necessity
defense
which
we
mentioned
in
our
reply
brief
or
the
meaning
of
the
word
disclosure
are
all,
of
course,
questions
of
application
that
will
be
given
judicial
interpretation
in
appropriate
cases
where
they
arise.
the
salient
point
here
is
that
the
respondents
have
not
made
a
case,
either
in
their
briefs
or
here,
that
going
solely
against
the
wiretapper
is
going
to
significantly
protect
privacy.
and
contrary
to
their
representation,
the
legislative
history
does,
in
fact,
reflect
both
great
solicitude
for
the
privacy
rights
involved
and
that's
quoted
at
page
3
of
our
reply
brief
and
also
repeatedly
the
recognition
that
wiretapping
and
bugging
and
now
of
course
we
have
hacking
into
e
mails
is
almost
completely
impossible
of
interception
or
even
detection.
the
nominal
fine
that
mr.
levine
referred
to
levine
referred
to
is,
of
course,
$5,000
which
is
not
nominal
with
respect
to
most
people,
and
in
any
event
exists
independent
of
the
civil
remedy
under
2520
that
congress
thought
was
appropriate
and
congress
said
in
the
legislative
history
was
appropriate
to
vindicate
the
privacy
rights
of
the
people
whose
privacy
interests
were
not
vindicated.
the
notion
that
there
is
a
limiting
principal
for
facts
of
public
significance,
i
think,
is
fatal.
first
of
all,
if
there
were
such
an
exception,
that
would
not...
that
would
deprive
the
statute
of
being
content
neutral.
and
second
of
all,
there
is
almost
no
way
to
draw
the
line,
as
justice
scalia
suggests,
for
what
is
publicly
significant.
this
court
has
already
held
twice
that
the
name
of
a
woman
who
has
been
raped,
not
the
fact
that
there
was
a
rape
or
the
name
of
the
perpetrator,
but
the
victim
is
a
matter
of
public
significance
and
public
interest.
so
we
don't
think
that
there
is
a
constitutional
way
to
draw
a
line
here.
the
daily
mail
principle
that
the
other
side
bases
its
case
on
is
distinguishable
from
this
case
and
this
law
in
five
critical
respects.
those
were
laws
that
applied
only
to
the
press
and
not
to
nonexpressive
uses.
they
were
content
based
laws
reflected
a
determination
that
society
should
not
know
certain
information.
they
reflect...
they
dealt
with
information
that
came
from
the
government
that
is
not
in
the
hands
of
private
parties
and
there
are,
we
understand,
reasons
to
respect
a
censorial
motive
when
the
government
seeks
to
limit
disclosure
of
information
about
its
own
activities.
they
did
not...
they
all
obtained...
involved
information
that
was
lawfully
obtained.
every
single
one
of
the
persons
who
gave
that
information
to
the
newspaper
got
it
lawfully.
