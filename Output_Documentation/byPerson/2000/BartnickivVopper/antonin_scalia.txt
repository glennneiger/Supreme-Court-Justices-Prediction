justice

which
is
what
happened
here,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
an
anonymous
tape
was
sent
to
the
radio
station
which
is
almost
always
the
way
it
will
happen.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wouldn't
think
of
doing--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
wouldn't
think
of
doing
that,
of
course,
if
somebody
sent
me
a
tape
that
i
knew
had
been
illegally
taken,
i
certainly
wouldn't
run
around
talking
to
people
about
it.
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
so
outrageous.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
justice
kennedy
lives
in
my
neighborhood,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think...
i
think
that
the
other
side
would
have
acknowledged
that
if
it
was
indeed
it
was
a
clear
threat
to
blow
off
somebody's
porches
there
might
have
been
an
exception
to
the
statute.
i
don't
want
to
decide
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
this
was
a
threat
to
blow
off
somebody's
porch.
it's
at
least
ambiguous
in
the
record
and
if
all
you
want
is
a
decision
that
you
can
disseminate
it
if
it's
a
threat
to
blow
off
somebody's
porch,
i'll
give
you
that,
that's
an
easy
case.
but
you
want
us
to
go
beyond
that
and
you
want
us
to
say
even
if
it
wasn't
a
threat
to
blow
off
somebody's
porch,
it
can't
be
disseminated;
isn't
that
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
let's
forget
about
blowing
up
the
porch.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
would
be
content
for
a
holding
that
says
that
a
statute
that
does
not
contain
such
an
exception
is
unconstitutional;
is
that
what
you're
asking
us
for?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
us
to
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
that
this
statute
does
not
have
any
exception
for
threatened
criminal
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
my
ability
to
speak
over
the
phone
with
some
assurance
of
confidentiality
an
interest
of
the
highest
order.
i
mean
you
have
speech
involved
on
both
sides
of
this
bear
in
mind.
that
to
the
extent
the
position
you
urge
renders
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
prohibition
against
intercepting
my
telephone
conversations
less
effective.
it
inhibits
my
speech.
and
indeed
it
does.
i
mean
i
don't
use
my
home...
what
is
it
it...
wire
free
phone--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whenever
i
talk
to
anything
involving
the
court,
because,
you
know,
i
don't
know,
i
don't
know
who
is
picking
it
up.
and
you're
saying
it's
perfectly
okay
for
somebody
not
only
to
pick
it
up
but
to
publish
it
in
the
washington
post
so
long
as,
you
know,
so
long
as
they
didn't
actually
do
the
tap,
just
make
a
tape
and
mail
it
to
the
post.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
is
perfectly
okay
to
give
the
person
who
picked
it
up
exactly
what
that
person
wanted,
that
is,
dissemination
of
my
private
conversations.
i...
you
enable
the
criminal
to
achieve
the
object
of
his
criminality.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
no
collaboration
but
this
is
an
essential
instrument
for
the
criminal's
achieving
what
he
wanted
to
achieve.
and
that
is
disseminate
to
the
world
information
which
he
has
unlawfully
obtained.
it
doesn't
seem
me
unreasonable
for
the
government
to
say
no,
we're
not
going
to
let
the
criminal
get
the
advantage
of
his
criminality.
we
do
the
same
thing
where
the
highest
function
of
government
of
all
is
involved,
the
criminal
law.
we
prevent
information
from
being
introduced,
even
told
to
the
jury
when
it
has
been
obtained
illegally.
i
find
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
newspaper's
not
going
to
publish
it
unless
it
has
public
interest?
and
is
public
interest
and
public
significance
the
same
thing?
i
mean,
you
know,
somebody
taps
the
phones
of
a
prominent
public
official
or
of
a
prominent
jurist
and
it
turns
out
the
guy
swears
like
a
trooper
and
this...
you
know,
and
the
whole
conversation
is
published
in
the
paper.
is
that
a
matter
of
public
significance?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
to
read
statutes
unreasonably.
i
mean
if
that's
an
unreasonable
result,
don't
read
disclose
to
mean
that.
i
mean
you
usually
reads
statutes
to
produce
both
constitutional
and
reasonable
results
where
that's
possible.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
knows
it
was
illegally
obtained.
he
didn't
know
who
illegally
obtained
it.
do
you
really
think
this
phone
conversation
what,
just
dropped
out
of
the
air
or
something?
it
was
obviously
illegally
obtained.
wasn't
it
an
obvious
phone
tap?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
why
do
you
have
to
know
who
did
it?
