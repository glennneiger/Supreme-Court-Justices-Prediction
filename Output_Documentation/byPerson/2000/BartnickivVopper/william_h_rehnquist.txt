chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
99-1687,
gloria
bartnicki
and
anthony
kane
v.
frederick
vopper.
mr.
collins.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
it's
very
difficult,
is
it
not,
to
enforce
the
prohibition
against
wire
tapping
against
the
person
who
actually...
who
actually
does
the
tapping.
in
other
words,
that
person
is
usually
not
going
to
come
to
light
or
publicize
the
thing.
the
way
that
person
does
the
work
is
to
push
it
on
to
somebody
else
who
will
do
the
disclosure.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
collins.
general
waxman,
we
will
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
don't
want
anymore.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
waxman,
what
about
the
situation,
this
is
broadcast
over
a
radio
station
in
wilkes
barre,
as
i
understand
it.
now
supposing
the
wilkes
barre
newspaper
wants
to
do
a
story
about
the
fact
that
this
was
broadcast,
how
far
down
the
line
does
it
go?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
may.
mr.
goldstein.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
levine,
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
mr.
levine,
you
agree
that
there
is
an
exception
for
matters
of
the
highest
priority.
how
about
our
decision
in
hill
against
colorado
last
year,
which
involved,
you
know,
protected
speech
on
one
hand
but
said
nonetheless
the
state
could
permit
a
strong
interest
in
privacy
to
triumph.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
something
like
that
happened
here,
didn't
it?
i
mean
there
is
an
anonymous
interceptor
who
gave
if
to
a
radio
station.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
presume
that
the
government
ought
to
have
some
presumption.
they
are
saying
that
it's
very...
they
enforce
these
laws.
they
are
just
saying
it's
just
very
difficult
to
find
this
person,
the
initial
interceptor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
levine.
mr.
goldstein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
you
then
presumably
have
other
ideas
as
to
how
the
government
might
get
at
this
problem,
less
drastic,
perhaps?
what
are
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now
what's
the
difference
if
we...
do
our
cases
articulate
any
difference
between
public
significance
and
public
interest.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
answer
the
question
yes
or
no?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you're
presenting
it
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
no
longer--
--not
according
to
solicitor
general.
he
says
the
word
disclosed
means
that
once
it
has
been
publicly
disclosed,
the
next
person
is
not
a
discloser.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
hope
you
will.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
expressed
in
the
government's
brief
or
is
this
just
something
that
you're
adding
to
the
government's
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
your
feeling
is
that
if
it's
just
disclosed
in
northeastern
pennsylvania,
then
someone
who
discloses
it
perhaps
in
northwestern
pennsylvania
is
disclosing
it
anew?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
sure
does.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
wouldn't
a
reporter
or
a
news
station
ordinarily
want
to
check
out
a
story?
are
they
just
going
to
get
the
tape
and
say
gee,
let's
put
it
on?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
goldstein.
general
waxman,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
waxman.
the
case
is
submitted.
