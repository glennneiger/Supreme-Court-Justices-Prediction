mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
even
if
the
petitioners
are
correct
that
the
wire
tap
acts
redisclosure
prohibition
and
that's
what
i'll
call
it,
it's
the
second,
third,
fourth
person
to
receive
it,
even
if
that
prohibition,
prophylactically
adds
some
deterrent,
as
justice
scalia
and
the
chief
justice
have
suggested,
and
justice
breyer's
concern
about
privacy
identifies,
even
if
it
does
add
some
deterrent,
that
prohibition
is
too
crude
a
weapon,
effectively
a
thermonuclear
bomb
of
sorts
to
be
sustained
in
the
sensitive
area
of
not
property
but
free
speech.
it
therefore
should
be
invalidated
at
least
under
intermediate
scrutiny.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
we
believe
that
the
solution
adopted
by
the
third
circuit,
the
narrow
approach
it
took
is
the
one
that
is
appropriate
under
intermediate
scrutiny
and
that
is
it
left
in
place
by
and
large
the
redisclosure
prohibition
but
recognized
that
when
the
final
disclosure
is
on
a
question
of
public
significance,
and
is
by
a
person
completely
uninvolved
in
the
illegal
interception,
then
the
speech
rights
outweigh.
so
when
you
have
only
the
circumstance
where
you
have
speech
on
a
matter
of
public
significance,
not
just
what
was
happening
on
the
phone,
someone
came
in
and
just
overheard
my
conversation
in
my
bedroom,
they
adopted
a
line...
this
a...
a
principle
that
exists
in
lots
of
this
court's
cases,
including
in
the
defamation
context,
in
pickering
balancing,
when
you're
speaking
on
a
matter
of
public
importance,
that's
when
the
first
amendment
interests
are
at
their
highest.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
is
a
matter
of
public
interest.
this
court--
but
it
may
well
not
be
a
matter
of
public
significance.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the
court
has--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
because
it
hasn't
been
presented,
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
would--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
chief
justice,
in
three
lines
of
cases,
the
court
has
taken...
has
drawn
the
line
at
public
significance
and
i
will
identify
them
specifically.
defamation
and
libel,
the
hustler
magazine
case,
the
philadelphia
newspaper
v.
hepps
case
and
dun
&
bradstreet
all
turn
on
whether
or
not
the
speech
in
question
is
on
an
issue
of
public
significance.
the
same
is
true
in
the
pickering
balancing
cases,
including
particularly
the
court's
opinion
in
united
states
v.
national
treasury
employee's
union
which,
too,
was
a
content
neutral
statute.
but
i
need
to
return
to
what
else
we
would
say,
what
other
strictures
we
would
put
on
the
statute
in
order
to
permit
it
to
survive
intermediate
scrutiny
and
still
fulfill
what
we
agree
is
an
important
governmental
interest
and
that
is
that
no
one
wants
people
tapping
phones
and
breaking
into
homes.
the
difficulty
here
is
that
there
are
a
number
of
respects
in
which
the
statute
is
not
tailored
whatsoever.
and
so
i
want
to
get
to
justice
stevens'
point
that
really
this
does
get
to
the
heart
of
the
matter.
the
real
problem
is
that
this
is
not
a
case
like
the
daily
mail
case
where
it
is
a
one
to
one
trade
off,
we're
going
to
reduce
some
speech
in
order
to
further
some
other
interest.
we
have
here
a
statute
that
is
so
broad
that
much
speech
that
the
government
has
no
interest
or
actual
intent
to
stop
from
being
published
will
in
fact
be
published.
the
different...
i
will
identify
five
distinctions.
the
first
is
that
it
applies
equally
and
i
mean
all
the
way
down
the
line
in
terms
of
punishment
whether
or
not
you
can
put
someone
in
jail,
identical
fines
to
the
newspaper
that
is
the
10th
party
down
the
line
to
receive
the
information
as
to
the
intercepting.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
argument
is
not
inconsistent
with
what
i
have
just
said.
i
will
explain
why.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
the
radio
station
here
played
the
tape
in
this
area
of
northeastern
pennsylvania,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
new
york
times
comes
along
and
listens
and
says
oh,
my
goodness,
look
what
happened
here.
they
then
publish
it
nationally.
under
the
soliciter
general's
interpretation,
that
is
a
violation
of
the
statute
because
it
wasn't
known
to
the
people
in
california.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
in
the
difficult
position
that
this
argument
is
made
in
one
sentence
in
the
government's
reply
brief
and
so
this
is
my
understanding.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
exactly.
and
as
ridiculous
as
that
sounds--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--and
i...
i
agree
with
you
that
it's
ridiculous
but
it
is
what
the
statute
says
and
it's
completely
consonant
with
what
congress
was
apparently
attempting
to
do
here.
if
you
look
through
the
petitioner's
brief,
time
and
again,
they
say
each
time
it
gets
out
it's
like
a
hundred
thousand
people
intercepting
the
communication.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
the
plain
text
of
the
statute
uses
a
much
broader
term
than
is
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general
and
let
me
continue
with
the
other
four
problems
with
tailoring.
the
second
is
that
it
applies
to
any
piece
of
information
about
the
conversation,
not
merely
the
tape.
the
fact
that,
and
justice...
there
was
a
question
about
talking
to
my
neighbor.
in
this
context
if
you
receive
innocently
a
tape
recording
and
merely
mention
the
fact
that
you
have...
you
know
that
there
was
a
tape
recording
of
the
conversation,
it
applies
equally
because
the
definition
of
contents
is
so
broad.
it's
literally
any
datum
about
the
conversation.
the
third
is
that
it
imposes
civil
and
criminal
liability
and
permits
the
commencement
of
litigation
even
when
there
has
been
no
injury
at
all.
and
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
disavowed
any
claim
that
they
had
been
actually
been
hurt.
the
fourth
is
that
it
applies
equally
no
matter
whether
the
information
and
indeed
the
conversation
in
question
was
even
private.
and
this
was
justice
o'connor's
first
question
is
that
the
information
that
was
spoken
and
was
heard
and
intercepted
could
have
been
a
completely
public
fact
but
the
fact
that
it
was
said
in
a
conversation
would
be
disclosed,
and
fifth
and
this
one
is
the
particularly
troubling
one
that
i
began
with,
it
applies
even
when
the
information
is
of
vital
public
significance.
now,
the
reason
i
mentioned
these
five
is
that
you
have
to
look
at
someone
who
is
in
the
position
of
receiving
a
piece
of
information
and
there
is
the
grave
concern
that
when
you
get
a
piece
of
information
notwithstanding
the
reason
to
know
the
limitation
which
is
what
the
solicitor
general
points
had
to
saving
the
statute,
you
had
real
doubts
about
the
provenance
of
information.
because
of
the
great
breath
of
the
statute,
it's
unlike
daily
mail
and
it's
unlike
florida
star.
you've
got
a
rape
victim's
name
and
you
know
okay
that's
prohibited.
i'm
not
going
to
say
that
if
i
followed
the
statute
and
its
constitutional--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--mr.
chief
justice,
if
that's
the
case
then
i
don't
think
that
we
have
a
problem.
if
you
are
going
to
have
a
situation
where
you
attempt
to
discern
the
provenance
of
information,
this
case...
this
statute
operates
only
in
the
circumstance
where
the
newspaper
doesn't
know
the
intercepting
party.
if
the
newspaper
knows
the
intercepting
party
then
the
statute
operates
because
the
newspaper
will
be
subpoenaed
and
will
have
to
testify
about
who
gave
them
the
interception
and
that
person
will
be
prosecuted.
in
the
situation
where
you
don't
know
and
if
the
court's
point
is
that
look,
it
simply
won't
be
published
in
that
instance
we
don't
have
a
problem
because
the
broader
disclosure
won't
happen.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
let
me
begin
by
stepping
back
to
the
variant
on
that
question
that
you
asked
my
colleague.
and
i
do
want
to
specify,
that
when
it
comes
to
things
like
diaries,
the
intellectual
property
laws
still
apply
fully
in
the
same
way
they
did
in
cowles,
those
sorts
of
copyright
laws,
and
we
don't
doubt
that
if
it's
a
diary
and
it's
something
that
is
your
personal
information,
you
have
written
it
down,
that
you
can
claim
that
you
have
stolen
something
like
intellectual
property.
your
version
to
me
was,
can't
we
try
hard
to
reduce
the
incentives,
and
i
think
congress
is
doing
that
here.
there
is
no
record
that
suggests
there
is
a
real
problem,
but
i
think
we
all
agree
intuitively,
it
will
reduce
somewhat
the
incentive
to
engage
in
the
interception.
our
problem
is
that
it's
a
purely
prophylactic
ban
on
someone
and
could
result
in
massive
punitive
damages
or
jail
time
on
someone
who
hasn't
engaged
in
the
primary
wrongdoing.
where
the
prophylaxis
has
broken
down,
my
client
has
no
idea
who
gave
him
this
piece
of
information.
he
has
it.
it's
of
public
significance.
it's
a
legitimate
threat
on
page.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
was
an
obviously...
it
was
obviously
recorded
and
very
likely
recorded
by
someone
who
wasn't
a
party
to
it.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
because
he
is
not
engaged
in
anything
that
anyone
believes
is
wrong.
he
has
information,
a
legitimate
threat.
the
court
of
appeals,
justice
scalia,
on
page
26-a
of
the
petition
appendix
explains
that
this
is
not
just
an
idle
threat.
he
says
really,
truthfully,
we're
going
to
have
to
do
some
work
on
these
people,
blow
off--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--with
respect,
that
is
not
correct,
particularly
as
to
my
client.
immediately
after
receiving
it,
within
a
day,
he
published
it,
disclosed
it
in
the
sense
of
the
statute
by
giving
it
to
the
radio
station
and
notifying
the
people
who
were
the
subject.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
he
did.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
think
that
there
is
something
to
be
said
of
warning
the
public.
but
i
agree--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--when
he
gave
it
to
the
radio
station,
yes,
we
were.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
is
correct.
our
point
is
that
when
you
have
a
piece
of
information
and
the
prophylactic
goals
of
the
statute
have
broken
down
and
it
is
a
matter
of
public
significance,
you
are
not
involved
in
anything
that
congress
attempted
to
stop.
it
is
speech
of
the
highest
interest.
when
you
have
a
limited
holding
like
the
third
circuit
did
here
under
intermediate
scrutiny,
if
it
is
only
speech
on
matters
of
public
significance
and
by
someone
who
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
interception,
has
no
idea
who
was,
that
speech
is
protected.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
has
reason
to
know.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
souter,
if
i
said
this
wasn't
what
congress
was
trying
to
do,
i
misspoke.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
we
agreed
that
that
was
congress'
goal.
our
point
in
that
respect
is
twofold,
is
that
neither
the
congress
nor
the
plaintiffs
or
the
government
have
attempted
to
develop
any
record
that
that
was
a
serious
problem.
and
second
is
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
ginsburg,
they
had
the
opportunity
to
develop
a
record
in
this
case
and
the
other
two
cases
that
have
come
before
you,
that
are
the
peavey
case
and
the
baynor
case
have
gone
through
the
courts
and
no
one
has
suggested
that
they
are
going
to
develop
any
kind
of
record.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
they
did
not
attempt
in
this
case
to
put
forward
any
record
regarding
the
efficacy
of
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
think
maybe
you
and
i,
justice
ginsburg,
are
speaking
about
two
slightly
different
things.
the
first
is
a
point
you
identified
to
my
colleague
before
which
is,
is
it
really
difficult
to
identify
people
and
stop
them
when
they
are
doing
these
kinds
of
interceptions.
i
think
this
court
can
assume
that
to
be
the
case.
the
point
that
i
am
making
is
that
congress
when
it
legislated
here
did
not
operate
on
an
understanding
or
any
evidence
that
there
was
a
problem.
