well,
the
difference
is
in
one
case
they're
acting
unlawfully
and
in
the
other
case
they
have
information
that
they
just
came
across
because
someone
else
acted
unlawfully
and
that'd
be
a
big
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
the
strongest
argument
that
i
think
judge
pollack
made
in
his
dissent
is
that
you
want
to
dry
up
the
market
for
this
sort
of
thing
so
you
get...
just
sort
of
like
child
pornography
and
the
majority
said,
well,
there's
really
no
evidence
that
this
will
accomplish
that
goal.
and
i
would
kind
of
like
you
to
comment
on
that
because
it
does
seem
to
me
that
an
awful
lot
of
this
illegal
activity
will
continue
to
go
on
by
people
who
just
use
it
for
their
own
private
illicit
purposes
no
matter
whether
you
apply
this
particular
rule.
and
i
think
the
scarcity
of
cases
suggest
that
enforcing
this
rule
really
would
not
do
very
much
to
dry
up
the
market
but
maybe
you'd
comment
on
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
i
don't
understand
there
to
be
any
exception
in
the
statute
for
speech
that
threatens
to
blow
off
somebody's
porch.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
really
don't
care
whether
you
win
or
not,
you
just
want
to
win
on
the
right
grounds,
is
that
what
you
want?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
sure.
well
then
stop
giving
out
your
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
rationale
of
the
statute
is
to
dry
up
the
market,
it
doesn't
prohibit
too
much
speech,
it
prohibits
precisely
the
amount
of
speech
that
is
the
product
of
what
the
statute
is
aimed
at.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
you're
arguing
about
the
quantity.
the
quantity
is
precisely
tailored
to
the
underlying
criminal
conduct.
it's
the
fruits
of
that,
just
like
the
fruits
of
an
illegal
search,
to
take
justice
scalia's
example.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
the
problem
is
illegal
intercepts.
and
it
covers
the
product
of
every
illegal
intercept.
it
doesn't
cover
any
speech
that
is
not
the
product
of...
it
seem
it
is
to
me
their
tailoring
argument
is
not
really
very
persuasive.
it
exactly
fits,
in
terms
of
quantity,
if
you're
just
talking
about
quantity,
the
quantity
is
exactly
the
full
market
for
this
illegal
activity.
