mr.
collins,
may
i
ask
you
if
i
understand
your
first
amendment
boundaries
theory
correctly,
that
pentagon
papers
which
was
a
prior
restraint
case,
if
congress
so
provided,
the
times
or
anybody
else
who
published
the
materials
could
after
the
publication
be
held
responsible
in
money
damages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
general
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
shouldn't
the
government
at
least
have
a
chance
to...
i
mean,
the
government
here
was
cut
off.
there
hasn't
been
any
trial.
there
were
1292-b
certifications.
the
third
circuit
said
the
statute
is
no
good.
if
the
question
is,
is
it
really
difficult
to
get
out...
get
after
interceptors,
shouldn't
the
government
have
had
a
chance
to
show
that
indeed
it
is?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
they
should
have
time
to
do
it
under
the
procedure
as
it
has
gone
so
far,
they
haven't.
if
that's
the
flaw--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--then,
but
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong.
i
thought
the
district
court
kept
the
case
there,
certified
questions
to
the
third
circuit.
the
third
circuit
didn't
say
but
now
you
have
a
chance
to
show
it,
just
cut
him
off.
they
prevailed
in
the
district
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
they
knew
they
were
required
to
do
something
beyond
the
intuitive
judgment
that
people
make
that
of
course
nobody
is
going
to
do
this
if
nobody
is
going
to
touch
it,
if
it's
going
to
be
treated
like
a
hot
potato.
