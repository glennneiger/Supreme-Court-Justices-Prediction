mr.
lee
levine
mr.
levine,
your
honor.
mr.
lee
levine
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondents
are
before
the
court
this
morning
because
they
disseminated
to
the
public
the
contents
of
a
telephone
conversation
in
which
the
president
of
a
public
teacher's
union
apparently
threatened
to
blow
off
the
the
front
porches
of
the
homes
of
members
of
the
local
school
board.
petitioners
contend
that
such
an
act
of
pure
speech
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment
because
that
information
was
at
some
prior
time
unlawfully
acquired
by
someone
else.
mr.
lee
levine
so
long
as--
mr.
lee
levine
--your
honor,
i--
mr.
lee
levine
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
is
why
i
gave
the
context
to
explain
why
this
speech
that
was
disseminated
by
the
respondents
here
was
truthful
and
involved
a
matter
of
public
concern.
mr.
lee
levine
that
is
correct
justice
stevens.
on
its
face,
the
statute
applies
to
any
information
concerning
the
content
of
an
intercepted
communication.
and
content
is
defined
in
the
statute
as
any
information
concerning
the
substance,
purport
or
meaning
of
that
communication.
mr.
lee
levine
i'm
asking
your
honors
to
apply
the
principle.
mr.
lee
levine
no,
your
honor.
mr.
lee
levine
the
except...
what
it
doesn't
have
an
exception
for,
your
honor,
is
the
dissemination
of
truthful
speech
about
a
matter
of
public
concern.
mr.
lee
levine
your
honor,
i'll
take
it
any
way
i
can
get
it.
mr.
lee
levine
but
the
principle
that
we're
advocating
because
it
derives
from
this
court's
case
law
is
the
daily
mail
principle.
and
the
daily
mail
principle
holds
that
where,
as
here,
a
speaker
has
lawfully
acquired
the
information
he
disseminates
and
that
information
is
accurate
and
involves
a
matter
of
public
concern,
his
speech
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
absent
a
demonstrated
need
to
vindicate
an
interest
of
the
highest
order.
mr.
lee
levine
cordless.
mr.
lee
levine
your
honor,
let
me
make
clear
it
is
not
perfectly
okay
to
pick
it
up.
that
is
violated
by
the
statute.
mr.
lee
levine
and
your
honor,
if
there
was
any
act
of
collaboration
between
the
criminal
and
the
fence,
as
has
been
called
in
some
amicus
briefs,
then
that
person
may
be
held
liable
for
his
own
conduct.
mr.
lee
levine
justice
scalia,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it's
not
unreasonable,
but
that's
not
the
standard
when
you're
talking
about
prohibition
on
the
dissemination
of
truthful
speech
about
a
matter
of
public
concern.
mr.
lee
levine
your
honor,
hill
versus
colorado
was
a
time,
place
or
manner
restriction,
and
the
court,
because
of
that
properly
analyzed
the
case
under
intermediate
scrutiny.
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
daily
mail
principle.
this
statute,
unlike
the
one
at
issue
in
the
hill
v.
colorado
case,
is
a
direct
prohibition
of
speech
itself.
it
is
not
a
time,
place
or
manner
restriction.
it
is
not
a
regulation
of
conduct
that
has--
mr.
lee
levine
--your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
content
neutrality
is
a
factor
when
you're
talking
about
application
of
the
daily
mail
principle.
mr.
lee
levine
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not.
the
statute
does
not
even
survive
intermediate
scrutiny.
and
in
that
regard,
let
me
get
to
a
point
that
both
justice
scalia
and
the
chief
justice
made
earlier.
this
notion
of
the
laundering
rationale
somehow
being
enough
to
make
the
statute
survive
intermediate
scrutiny.
that
rationale,
we
submit,
is
not
persuasive
when
you're
talking
as
we
are
here
about
matters
of
public
concern.
in
the
internet
age,
an
interceptor
doesn't
need
the
press
to
disseminate
anonymously
information
to
a
mass
audience.
even
if
he
did,
there
is
no
evidence
that
that
provides
that
person
with
an
incentive
to
intercept
in
the
first
place,
especially
where,
as
in
this
case
money
does
not
drive
the
market
hypothesized
by
the
petitioner.
there
may
well
be
the
occasional
case
in
which
an
anonymous
interceptor
gratuitously
throws
the
contents
of
an
intercepted
communication
over
the
transom,
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
this
is
a
systemic
problem
or
that--
mr.
lee
levine
--but
your
honor,
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
identity
of
the
interceptor
in
this
case
could
not
have
been
uncovered.
mr.
lee
levine
your
honor,
that
is,
with
all
due
respect
to
the
government,
purely
conjecture.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
support
that.
the
scores
of
prosecutions
under
the
acts
interception
provision
suggest
that
that's
not
true.
and
in
all
of
the
cases,
applying
the
acts,
use
and
disclosure
prohibitions
which
are
cited
in
the
appendix
to
our
briefs.
mr.
lee
levine
your
honor,
in
light
of
the
ample
evidence
that
is
contained
in
the
record
and
available
to
the
court,
that
at
least
when
you're
talking
about
matters
of
public
concern
as
you
are
here,
where
money
doesn't
drive
the
market
to
the
interception,
that
that
is
not
the
case.
i
think
warrants
a
conclusion
that
the
government
doesn't
need
to
be
able
to
do
that,
and
of
course
if
the
court
applies
the
daily
mail
principle,
we
don't
reach
that
question
because
the
daily
mail
principle
obviates
the
need
to
show
that,
especially
whereas
here
there
are
so
many
less
restrictive
alternatives
to
prohibiting
the
dissemination
of
information,
like
meaningful
criminal
penalties
against
the
interception
itself.
in
this
case,
your
honors,
the
maximum
criminal
penalty
that
could
be
applied
against
the
interceptor
of
this
communication
was
a
nominal
fine
with
no
possibility
of
incarceration.
in
the
baynor
case,
another
one
of
the
cases
that
is
pending
before
this
court,
the
interceptor
of
that
conversation
was
fined
$500.
mr.
lee
levine
your
honor,
if
the
information
did
not
involve
a
matter
of
public
concern--
mr.
lee
levine
--if
it
involves
a
matter
of
public
concern--
mr.
lee
levine
--and
there
is
no
unlawful
conduct
of
any
kind
by
the
person
who
publishes
the
information--
mr.
lee
levine
--your
honor,
i
think
i
misunderstood
your
question.
the
person
who
broke
into
your
house
and
listened
in--
mr.
lee
levine
--right.
mr.
lee
levine
that
person
can
be
prosecuted.
mr.
lee
levine
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lee
levine
your
honor--
mr.
lee
levine
--your
honor,
you
can
go
after
the
person
who
intercepted.
mr.
lee
levine
justice
breyer--
mr.
lee
levine
--justice
breyer,
if
i
understand
your
latest
iteration
of
the
hypothetical,
you
included
a
payment
in
there.
if
the
newspaper
paid
for
the
information,
that's
a
much
closer
question.
mr.
lee
levine
your
honors,
in
the
last
analysis,
this
statute
simply
prohibits
too
much
speech.
in
this
case
it
prohibits
respondent
yocum
from
notifying
members
of
the
school
board
that
they
might
be
in
danger.
mr.
lee
levine
the
answer
is
yes,
justice
kennedy,
because
if
an
intermediate
scrutiny
does
apply,
one
of
the
prongs
of
the
intermediate
scrutiny
test
is
that
the
statute
at
issue
must
not
prohibit
more
speech
than
is
necessary.
i
don't
see
how
a
litigant
in
our
position
can
make
that
point
without
making
the
arguments
that
we
have
here
about
the
fact
that
this
statute
simply
prohibits
too
much
speech.
the
statute
also
prohibits
the
media
respondents
from
sharing--
mr.
lee
levine
--but
if
you
focus
on
the
speech
itself,
justice
stevens,
and
it
is
truthful
and
it
involves
a
matter
of
public
concern,
that
speech
has
value.
that's
what
the
daily
mail
principle
is
all
about.
mr.
lee
levine
not
when...
not
when
the
congress
was
focused
on
other
kinds
of
interceptions
and
disclosures
involving
things
like
industrial
espionage,
insider
trading,
contested
divorce.
congress
did
not
focus
on
things
like
speech
involving
matters
of
public
concern.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
suggest
that
congress
thought
that
that
was
problem
that
it
was
trying
deal
with.
mr.
lee
levine
i
think
it's
fairest
to
say
that
i'm
talking
about
quantity
and
quality.
quality
in
the
sense
that
the
information
involving
truthful
speech
without
matters
of
public
concern
is
at
the
core
of
the
first
amendment
and
that's
what
this
statute
prohibits
in
addition
to
whatever
it
may
legitimately
prohibit
involving
speech
that
doesn't
involve
a
matter
of
public...
concern.
mr.
lee
levine
i
see
your
point
and
this
may
be
a
fine
distinction
in
response,
but
i
think
it's
an
important
one,
justice
breyer,
the
physical
diary
is
property.
taking
that,
regardless
of
what's
inside
it,
is
not
the
function
of
the
first
amendment
to
speak
to.
if
you're
talking
about
the
contents
of
the
diary,
the
information
and
you're
then
penalizing
someone
for
now
knowing
that
information,
having
it
in
his
brain
and
then
disseminating
it
to
other
people,
that
is
something
that
the
first
amendment
is
concerned
about,
especially
when
you're
talking
about
speech
that
is
the
truth
and
is
a
matter
of
public
concern.
mr.
lee
levine
that's
right.
mr.
lee
levine
that's
correct.
