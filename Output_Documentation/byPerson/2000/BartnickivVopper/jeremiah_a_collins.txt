mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
a
society
that
values
personal
freedom
and
autonomy,
there
is
a
vital
interest
in
securing
the
ability
of
individuals
to
exclude
unwanted
intruders
from
their
private
activities.
and
where
the
private
activity
consists
of
speech
there
is
a
particularly
vital
interest
in
preventing
intrusion
so
that
individuals
may
conduct
their
private
communications
freely
and
securely.
and
for
that
reason,
congress
and
the
legislatures
of
virtually
every
state
in
this
country
have
made
it
unlawful
to
gain
access
to
a
private
communication.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
because
i
think
justice
o'connor
what
congress
and
the
state
legislatures
and
in
some
respects
the
common
law
have
recognized
that
separate
and
apart
from
the
question
about
whether
there
is
certain
information
that
is
so
private
that
it
should
or
shouldn't
be
revealed
which
raises
content
discrimination
problems
among
other
things,
there
is
a
vital
interest
in
people
having
private
places
in
their
lives
where
a
stealthy
intruder
cannot
come
in
whether
or
not
the
individual--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--because
your
honor,
as
congress
and
some
forty
states
have
reasoned,
if
there
is
intrusion
into
an
individual's
private
communications,
a
tap,
a
bug,
a
scanner,
whatever,
and
then
what
is
obtained
is
broadcast
to
all
the
world
or
under
these
statutes
exploited
in
any
other
way,
the
same
interests
that
are
harmed
by
the
initial
intrusion
are
harmed
again
and
all
the
more
severely
because
in
essence,
you
have
invited
in
this
instance
a
hundred
thousand
people
to
eavesdrop,
and
as
petitioner
bartnicki
stated
in
her
deposition,
when
she,
having
no
idea
that
anyone
had
intruded
into
her
communication
with
mr.
kane,
when
she
heard
on
the
radio
it
being
broadcast
she
felt
that
she
had
been
violated
in
front
of
a
hundred
thousand
people
and
that
is
true
i
believe
independent
of
the
content.
if
i,
riding
home
today,
hear
a
radio
station
broadcasting
a
conversation
where
i
convey
my
grocery
list
to
my
wife
or
vice
versa,
i
feel
a
violation
of
my
personal
autonomy.
just
as
if
someone--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--if
you--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--well,
the
far
downstream
uses
are
not
at
issue--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--well
they...
i
think
your
honor,
first
of
all
they
can't
raise
it
when
they
they've
brought
explicitly
an
as
applied
challenge
and
at
no
point
in
the
litigation
until
this
court
have
they
started
raising
the
other
applications
that
they
now
posit,
and
secondly
this
court
in
the
florida
star
and
all
the
preceding
case
emphasize
that
in
the
very
difficult
area
and
it
is
difficult
of
conflicts
between
privacy
type
interests
and
first
amendment
interests
the
court
should
decide
only
as
much
as
it
needs
to
decide
in
a
particular
case.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
that
is
certainly
true
in
this
very
case--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
and
congress...
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case
and
congress
was
told
in
both
1968
and
'86
that
it
happens
very
frequently.
i
think--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--your
honor,
i
believe
the
same...
i
think
there
are
two
responses
to
that.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
i
think
there
are
two
responses
to
the
question,
your
honor.
the
first
is
there
is
in
the
law,
as
the
government's
reply
brief
points
out
a
doctrine
of
necessity
which
in
some
narrow
circumstances,
and
it's
not
precisely
clear
how
far
it
extends,
in
essence
privileges
what
would
otherwise
be
a
violation
of
a
statute.
if
the
statute
doesn't
rule
that
defense
out.
so
an
action
to
protect
life
and
limb
may
be
an
exception.
the
second
answer
though,
is
that...
because
it
is
a
very
hard
question,
but
there
are...
when
there
are
content
neutral
laws
that
say
that
because
of
the
way
in
which
information
came
to
someone,
that
information
is
not
to
be
revealed
be
it
these
statutes
or
be
it
for
example
a
protective
orders
in
the
seattle
times,
that
generally
the
fact
that
what
was
revealed
is
a
matter
of
public
importance
does
not
automatically
say
that
the
interests
that
are
being
served
by
the
content
neutral
law
that
says
either
you
should
not
have
this
information
at
all
or
you
should
not
be
able
to
use
it,
they
don't
necessarily
give
way.
and
that's
indeed
if
this
exact
tape
had
been
received
in
discovery
i
believe
under
seattle
times
the
press
could
again
be
prevented
from
making
use
and
publishing
the
tape.
and
the
key
is
that--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--but
in
both
instances,
though,
justice
kennedy,
we
are
saying
that
a
person
has
information,
it
is
of
public
importance,
and
because
of
interest
bound
up
in
the
way
in
which
they
received
it,
we
will
not
allow
them
to
distribute.
the
interests
are
different
granted.
and
the
court
did
not
say
in
seattle
times
that
the
fact
that
this
information
is
coming
in
discovery
means
there
is
no
first
amendment
concern.
quite
the
contrary.
the
court
said
the
court
has
to
conclude
that
there
will
be
harm
to
privacy
interests
and
the
like
if
it
is
disclosed
and
the
court
applied
intermediate
scrutiny.
but
the
court
said
that
because
of
interests
of
the
justice
system
that
are
served
by
being
able
to
limit
disclosure
of
that
which
is
given
in
discovery
we
can
tolerate
the
fact
that
the
press
cannot
tell
the
public
something
of
great
importance.
here
we
again
have
very
vital
interests,
different
interests,
but
the
interests
of
people
knowing
that
they
will
not
come
home
some
day
and
have
a
hundred
thousand
people
hearing
a
phone
call
that
they
made.
and
i
submit
that
what
unites
those
cases
and
in
essense
solves
the
problem
here
is
the
fact
that
we're
dealing
with
a
totally
content
neutral
statute
and
one
which
as
applied
does
not
unduly
interfere
with
the
ability
of
the
press--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--your
honor,
i
don't
know
of
any
case
in
which
this
court
has
struck
down
a
statute
which
is
content
neutral
in
the
full
sense
that
this
one
is
except
in
some
rare
circumstances
where
the
court
in
essence
has
determined
that
too
much
speech
is
going
to
be
supressed.
in
other
words,
we
are
not
saying,
we
don't
have
to
say,
that
some
of
this
is
a
category
of
speech
of
no
first
amendment
significance
whatsoever.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
there
are
important
governmental
interests
harmed
not
only
by
the
interception
but
by
the
disclosure.
if
those
are
then
taken
into
account
through
a
content
neutral
statutory
regime,
we
believe
and
we
have
argued
that
that
in
essence
exhausts
the
first
amendment
concerns
both
as
to
level
of
scrutiny
and
as
to
satisfying
scrutiny
as
long
as
we
are
not
in
one
of
the
rare
situations
such
as
city
of
ladue,
for
example,
where
the
court
would
say
granted
it's
content
neutral,
but
you're
just
restricting
too
much
speech
and
we
think
in
this
case
the
question
would
be,
the
concern
about
whether
this
content
neutral
law...
and
let
me
just
pause
for
a
moment
because
i
think
it's
essential
to
emphasize
when
i
say
content
neutral
this
law
is
neutral
in
a
way
that
absolutely
requires
a
determination
of
content
neutrality.
it's
neutral
as
to
viewpoint.
it's
neutral
as
to
subject
matter.
it
doesn't
allow
liability
to
turn
on
disagreement
with
a
particular
message.
it
doesn't
even
target
speech
specifically.
it
targets
all
uses
of
what
has
been
unlawfully
intercepted,
so
there
is
no
case
in
this
court
that
would
characterize
this
law
as
content
based.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
absolutely.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
it's
as
applied,
your
honor.
and
that's
clear
in
the
question
certified
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it's
clear
in
the
briefs
below.
and
it's
clear
from
the
fact--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--well,
certainly,
the
question
in
this
case
is
properly
presented
as
to
whether
the
statute
can
apply
to
those
who
are
not
involved
in
the
interception.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
we
submit
that
it
does
not
for
two
reasons.
that
first
of
all,
there
is...
we
are
applying
a
content
neutral
statute
based
on
important
government
interests
and
secondly...
and
i
do
think
this
is
critical,
we
then
have
to
ask
ourselves
is
this
one
of
the
very
rare
cases
in
this
court's
jurisprudence
where
one
would
say
that
even
though
a
statute
is
totally
neutral,
doesn't
lend
itself
to
government
thought
control,
to
supression
of
ideas
in
any
way,
it's
not
reshaping
public
debate,
totally
neutral,
does
it
in
some
way
restrict
too
much
speech?
and
one
area
where
one
would
worry
is,
does
it
prevent
the
press
from
doing
what
it
needs
to
do?
we
believe
this
is
not
such
a
narrow...
one
of
those
rare
situations
because
as
the
court
says
branzburg--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--we
don't
deny
that
matters
of
public
concern
are
involved.
what
we
say
is
that
under
branzburg,
for
example,
the
court
says
that
we
know
the
press
could
get
important
information
of
public
concern
through
wire
tapping.
we
know
the
press
could
get
important
information
of
public
concern
by
having
a
system
of
private
informants.
we
say
to
the
press,
you
cannot
do
that.
even
if
you
know
that
behind
that
wall
is
someone
communicating
matter
of
utmost
public
importance,
you
can't
pierce
that
wall.
so
why
then
is
it
crucial
to
the
press
to
say
we
can't
ourselves
go
out
and
try
to
obtain
this
information
of
public
concern
through
wire
tapping
but
if
serendipitously
some
third
person
has
done
it,
it's
vital
us
to
be
able
to
then
use
the
information.
and
even
the
amici,
your
honors,
do
not
submit--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--i
think
in
the
final
analysis,
no,
your
honor,
because
as
i
understand
florida
star
and
this
court's
jurisprudence,
the
question
here
is
whether
there
are
sufficient
government
interests
to
justify
a
content
neutral
application
of
these
laws
in
this
manner.
it's
not
a
question
of
is
the
press
a
bad
actor
or
not
to
be
punished.
one
has
to
be
concerned
undoubtedly
will
the
press,
by
the
rule
that
we
advocate,
be
chilled
from
performing
its
function
and
we
argue
no
because
as
we
have
briefed
the
way
that
the
reason
to
factor
can
be
construed
under
this
statute,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
proper
analysis
of
the
issues
here
can
ultimately
turn
simply
on
did
the
press
violate
a
law
when
they
received
the
information
or
not,
otherwise
of
course
congress
could
take
a
jab
with
the
pen
and
say,
oh,
and
also
it's
illegal...
to
be
receiving
any
that
has
been
intercepted.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
possibly,
your
honor,
but
pentagon
papers
would
be
different
not
only
for
the
reason
you
gave
but
because
it's
arguably
content
based.
it's
the
government
itself
determining
what
information
by
subject
matter--
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
--well
if
it
applied
to...
but
it
wouldn't
be
general
because
it's
by
definition
talking
only
about
government
information
which
is
arguably
a
content
base.
mr.
jeremiah
a.
collins
and
it
runs...
there
you
do
get
into
of
the
risk
of
shaping
debate.
