justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
want
to
say
that
if
i
also
hear
that
and
tell
my
wife
that
i'm
committing
a
crime.
that's
what
this
statute
says.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
the
statute
goes
downstream
without
end.
now
maybe
there'll
be
some
creative
suggestion
for
when
it's
in
the
public
domain
or
something
like
that.
but
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
but
it
seems
to
me
with
all
respect
that
they
are
because
the
respondents
can
raise
those
issues
on
an
overly
broad
statute
under
the
thornhill
doctrine
even
if
this
does
not
apply
to
them.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
in
seattle
times
and
rhinehart
and
in
the
aguilar
case,
we
were
controlling
the
people
who
received
the
information
under
a
court
order.
they
were
within
our
immediate
control.
the
rhinehart
case
would
be
as
if
somebody
surreptitiously
took
this
tape
and
gave
if
to
a
person
and
then
that
person
gave
it
to
the
newspapers.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
merely
because
it's
content
neutral
does
not
mean
you
can
regulate
it.
this
isn't
seditious.
it
isn't
obscene.
and
there
is
no
category
that
i
know
of
which
allows
you
to
regulate
it.
it's
intercepted
which
is
now
going
to
be
a
new
category
under
your
rule
and
there
is
no
precedent
for
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yeah,
yeah,
but...
to
say
that
we've,
as
your
colleague
did,
it's
very
rare
to
strike
down
statutes
that
are
content
neutral.
that's
not
accurate.
miami
press
v.
tornado,
the
reply
statute
case...
taxes
on
newspapers
are
content
neutral,
the
parade
cases
are
content
neutral.
what
you're
doing
here
is
you're
suppressing
speech
that
is
valuable
to
the
public.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
problem
is
that
in
order
to
make
this...
no
one
questions,
we
can
assume
that,
that
you
can
punish
the
interceptor,
but
what
you're
doing
is
you're
taking
a
class
of
speech
and
saying
this
is
now
tainted
speech
and
it
can't
be
repeated
by
anybody.
and
there
is
simply
no
precedent
for
that
in
the
cases
of
this
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
can't
tell
my
next
door
neighbor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
i
innocently
hear
this
tape,
and
i'm
the
second
one
to
hear
it,
but
i
just
hear
it
at
yocum's
house,
then
i
can't
tell
my
neighbor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
permitted
to
raise
an
overbreadth
challenge
in
this
posture
of
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
guess
the
case
points
up
that
chattel
analogies
are
difficult
in
a
modern
age
of
digitized
speech,
et
cetera.
i
mean
you
don't
have
an
airline
ticket
anymore.
it's
just
out
there
in
a
computer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
the
government
is
trying
to
do
is
to
recognize
that
in
this
statute.
