justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
stop
you
right
there
and
ask
you
why
should
the
question
of
whether
private
information
about
someone
is
published
turn
on
how
the
information
was
obtained?
why
don't
you
just
look
at
what
it
is
and
focus
there?
why
does
it
become
secondarily
such
an
important
interest
to
focus
on
how
it
was
obtained?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well...
well,
it
ought
to
turn
on
the
public
significance
perhaps
of
the
information
and
presumably
the
state
can
prevent
unlawful
tapping
of
wires
directly
and
get
at
the
bad
actor,
but
why
should
it
extend
to
the
subsequent
user
who
didn't
do
anything
wrong?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
change
the
facts
just
a
little
bit.
suppose
what
the
conversation
revealed
was
not
some
conversation
about
we're
going
to
have
to
commit
some
violent
acts
but
let's
suppose
it
revealed
that
in
fact,
a
murder
had
been
committed
because
of
this
very
situation.
and
the
anonymous
tape
then
is
passed
on
to
the
police
and
your
going
to
punish
the
person
who
passed
on
that
tape
when
a
very
serious
crime
has
been
committed.
now
how
is
the
public
interest
served
by
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
i
actually
had
that
very
situation
as
a
trial
court
judge
in
a
murder
case.
i
had
a
hard
time
understanding
how
the
public
interest
was
served
by
punishing
the
person
who
passed
on
the
information.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
this
an
as
applied
challenge
in
this
suit--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--or
is
it
attacking
it
facially?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
would
there
be
a
difference
on
an
as
applied
challenge
if
the
person
you're
talking
about
is
the
person
who
made
the
wrongful
tapping
as
opposed
to
the
person
who
just
passes
it
on?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
would
it
matter
if
it's
a
newspaper
at
the
end
of
the
day
commenting
on
the
information
that's
been
disclosed?
does
that
alter
the
result?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
although
this
had
to
do
with
negotiations,
did
it
not
with
a
public
school
board
in
a
a
labor
union
context,
you
don't
think
that's
sufficiently
important
to
warrant
newspaper
discussion
of
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
may
nonetheless
deserve
intermediate
scrutiny
because
of
its
content
neutrality.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
lose
if
intermediate
scrutiny
is
applied?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court,
which
is
authored
by
justice
stevens
in
these
cases
to
announce
for
him.
they
come
on
certiorari
from
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals.
during
contentious
collective-bargaining
negotiations
between
a
union
representing
teachers
at
a
pennsylvania
high
school
and
the
local
school
board,
an
unidentified
person
intercepted
and
recorded
a
cellular
telephone
conversation
between
a
union
negotiator
and
the
union
president.
they
are
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
tthe
respondent
vopper,
a
radio
commentator,
subsequently
played
a
recording
of
the
intercepted
conversation
with
news
reports
about
the
settlement
reached
during
the
negotiation.
petitioners
then
brought
a
lawsuit
for
damages
under
both
federal
and
state
wiretapping
laws
against
the
respondents
vopper
and
yocum,
yocum
is
the
head
of
a
local
organization
oppose
to
the
union’s
demand
and
who
received
a
copy
of
the
unauthorized
tape
from
an
unknown
person
and
in
turn
gave
it
to
various
media
representatives.
in
ruling
on
cross-motions
for
summary
judgment
the
district
court
rejected
the
respondent’s
defense,
that
the
first
amendment
protected
the
disclosures
at
issue
even
though
they
violated
the
statute.
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
accepted
an
interlocutory
appeal,
and
the
petitioner
united
states
intervened
to
defend
the
federal
act’s
constitutionality.
applying
intermediate
scrutiny,
the
court
of
appeals
found
the
statutes
violated
the
first
amendment.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
the
constitutional
question,
and
we
now
hold
that
the
first
amendment
protects
the
disclosures
made
by
the
respondents
in
this
lawsuit.
because
of
this
suit’s
procedural
posture
we
assume
the
interception
of
the
cellphone
conversation
was
unlawful
and
that
respondents
had
reason
to
know
that.
accordingly
the
disclosures
violated
the
statutes,
in
considering
whether
the
statutes’
application
in
this
case
violates
the
first
amendment
we
accept
respondents’
submissions
that
they
played
no
part
in
the
illegal
interception,
that
their
access
to
the
information
was
obtained
lawfully,
and
that
the
conversations
dealt
with
a
matter
of
public
concern.
the
issue
in
this
suit
then
is
a
narrow
one,
wherein
individual
or
organization
has
lawfully
obtained
information
from
a
source
who
obtained
it
unlawfully,
may
the
government
punish
the
ensuing
publication
based
on
the
defect
in
the
chain.
our
refusal
to
construe
the
issue
more
broadly
is
consistent
with
our
repeated
refusal
to
answer
categorically
whether
the
publication
of
truthful
information
may
ever
be
punished
consistent
with
the
first
amendment.
the
first
interest
identified
by
the
government
removing
an
incentive
for
parties
to
intercept
private
conversations
does
not
justify
punishing
and
otherwise
innocent
disclosure
of
information.
the
normal
method
of
deterring
unlawful
conduct
is
to
punish
the
person
engaging
in
it
and
in
virtually
all
of
the
cases
brought
under
the
federal
statute
the
interceptor’s
identity
has
been
known.
moreover,
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
the
assumption
that
the
prohibition
on
disclosure
reduces
the
number
of
illegal
interceptions.
the
government's
second
interest,
minimizing
the
harm
to
persons
whose
conversations
have
been
illegally
intercepted,
is
considerably
stronger.
however,
our
commitment
to
the
principle
that
debate
on
public
issues
should
be
unlimited
robust
and
wide
open
supported
this
court’s
holding
in
new
york
times
versus
sullivan
that
neither
factual
error
nor
defamatory
content,
nor
a
combination
of
the
two
sufficed
to
remove
the
first
amendment
shield
from
criticism
of
official
conduct.
parallel
reasoning
requires
the
conclusion
that
a
stranger’s
illegal
conduct
does
not
suffice
to
remove
the
first
amendment
shield
from
speech
about
a
matter
of
public
concern.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
breyer
has
written
a
concurring
opinion,
which
i
joined;
the
chief
justice
has
written
a
dissenting
opinion,
which
justices
scalia
and
thomas
have
joined.
