justice
david
h.
souter
general,
isn't
the
problem
with
the
easy
analogy
to
the
other
intermediate
scrutiny
cases
that
here
there
in
effect
is
a
complete
suppression
of
speech,
whereas
in
the
paradigmatic
intermediate
scrutiny
cases,
somebody
can
speak
somewhere,
sometime.
o'brien
can
tell
what
he
thinks
about
the
draft
without
burning
his
card,
you
can
speak
at
some
other
time
or
some
other
place
in
the
time,
place,
and
manner
cases.
that's
not
so
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
also
and
i
think
you're
right
there
but
you
also
had
a
very
different
kind
of
general
statute
in
cohen
and
cowles--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
contract
law
and
not
speech
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may
be
it,
it
may
not
be
depending
on
other
circumstances,
but,
i
mean,
there
is
no
question
that
if
we
didn't
have
the
neutrality
that
you
emphasize
this
would
be
a
much
easier
case.
it's
still
true
that
when
you
do
the
balancing,
whether
you
call
it
intermediate
scrutiny
or
you
figure
out
some
other
level
to
put
it
on,
you're...
what
you've
got
to
balance
is
that
if
this
law
is
good,
then
the
disclosure
which
apparently
has
no
other
source
of
information
which
is
of
concern
to
the
public
is
absolutely
forbidden
and
we've
got
to
accept
that
as
one
of
the
prices
that
will
be
paid.
maybe
as
you
say
not
in
every
case
but
it
will
be
paid
if
the
statute
is
going
to
be
enforced
across
the
board.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think
your
argument
is
that
blowing
off...
the
willingness
to
blow
off
porches
is
a
matter
of
some
public
concern
in
viewing
the
labor
crisis.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
it
the
case
that
by
the
time
the
publication
which
is
the
subject
of
this
action
occurred,
the
threat
was
over?
this
publication
all
occurred
after
the
point
at
which
the
threat
was
gone--
justice
david
h.
souter
--why
didn't
he
just
notify
the
people
who
were
the
subjects
of
the
threat?
justice
david
h.
souter
once
it
goes
to
the
radio
station
you're
not
talking
about
an
exception
for
people
who
are
performing
the
public
service
of
warning
victims.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
public's
porches
weren't
going
to
be
blown
off,
the
school
committee's
porches
were
going
to
be
blown
off,
and
they
were
notified.
so
that
when
it
went
to
the
radio
station,
we
weren't
worried
about
potential
victims
of
porch
blowings,
were
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
at
the
same
time,
he
was
making
it
known,
i
forget
how,
but
he
was
making
it
known
to
the
victims
so
that
the
radio
station
was
not
necessary
to
make
it
known
to
the
victims
and
the
people
who
learn
through
the
radio
station
weren't
potential
victims.
that's
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
who
knows
that
someone
upon
whom
he
is
depending
acted
illegally.
justice
david
h.
souter
has
reason
to
know
and
certainly
there
is
reason
to
know
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
and...
and
congress
certainly
did
intend
to
stop
that,
it
seems
to
me,
contrary
to
what
you
said.
why
do
you
suggest
that
this
is
outside
of
ambit
of
what
concerned
congress.
congress
wanted
to
dry
up
a
market,
and
i
can't
think
of
a
more
obvious
market
than
the
market
of
a
radio
station
which
has
reason
to
know
that
it
is
publishing
illegally
seized
interceptions.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
you
did
say
that.
