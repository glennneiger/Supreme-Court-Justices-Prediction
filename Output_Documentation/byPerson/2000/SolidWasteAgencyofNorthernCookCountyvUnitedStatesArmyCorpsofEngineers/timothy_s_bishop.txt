mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
by
1972
the
terms
navigable
waters
and
waters
of
the
united
states
had
a
settled
meaning
after
a
century
during
which
congresses
and
this
court's
conception
of
what
those
terms
meant
had
expanded
significantly
from
an
initial
strict
view
that
the
navigable
waters
were
those
navigable,
in
fact,
to
a
recognition
that
they
included
in
addition
waters
navigable
with
improvements
and
tributaries
of
those
waters,
to
this
court's
statement
in
the
union
electric
case
in
1965
that
the
only
things
excluded
were
intrastate
nonnavigable
waters
that
did
not
flow
into
the
navigable
waters.
by
1972,
when
the
act
was
passed,
the
broadest
conception
of
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
included
all
waters
that
form
part
of
a
single
aquatic
system
with
navigable
waters
in
the
traditional
sense,
that
flow
into
and
so
can
affect
the
quality
of
those
waters.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
the
traditional
phrase
that
appears
over
and
over
again
in
the
statutes
and
in
the
court's
opinions
is
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states,
but
there
are
instances
where
those
are
broken
up,
and
in
effect
the
terms
are
used
interchangeably.
in
section
10
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1899,
for
example,
the
statute
begins
by
talking
about
protecting
the
navigable
capacity
of
the
waters
of
the
united
states,
and
immediately
switches
to
talk
about
preventing
obstructions
to
the
navigable
waters.
in
a
much
more
recent
statute,
1990,
the
aquatic
nuisance
prevention
act,
which
i
did
not
cite
in
my
brief,
but
which
i
have
alerted
the
solicitor
general
to,
it's
at
16
usc
4702.
that
is
a
statute
in
which
the
jurisdictional
term
is
waters
of
the
united
states.
what's
the
definition
in
the
statute?
navigable
waters.
the
phrases
have
been
used
interchangeably
in
statutes
and
in
this
court's
opinions,
and
in
our
reply
brief
in
a
footnote
towards
the
end
we
cited
a
number
of
opinions.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
yes,
i
think
in
that
same
footnote
we
cite
a
number
of
cases
where
the
waters
of
the
united
states
is
used
in
contradistinction
to
the
waters
of
the
states.
one
of
the
problems
with
the
government's
interpretation
is
that
there
is
no
longer
any
such
thing
as
the
waters
of
the
states.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
just
one
question.
we're
not
taking
a
position
on
groundwaters.
the
circuits
are
in
conflict
on
that.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
some
courts
have
held
that
groundwaters
that
are
connected
to
the...
that
is,
flow
into
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states,
serve
as
a
source.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
there
is
no
evidence
of
that.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
i
think
what
the
congress
had
in
mind
in
borrowing
the
common
law
and
prior
statutory
meanings
of
these
terms
was
that
it
did
want
to
protect
water,
but
it
was
also
very
cognizant
of
states'
rights
and
retained
rights
under
the
10th
amendment
to
regulate,
and
wanted
to
maintain
limits
on
the
scope
of
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
clearly
i
have
to
accommodate
that
position,
and
that
is
one
that
congress
addressed
specifically
as
the
court
noted
in
riverside
bayview.
it
pointed
out
that
the
adjacent
wetland
abutted
and
drained
into
the
navigable
waters.
i
think
what
congress
had
in
mind,
when
you
read
the
legislative
history,
in
the
context
of
the
statutory
language
and
the
history
of
these
terms
is
not,
as
the
government
says,
the
commerce...
the
effects
of
commerce
jurisdiction,
but
the
channels
jurisdiction.
it
was
interested
in
expanding
federal
jurisdiction
over
the
water
as
a
protective
matter
as
far
as
it
thought
it
could.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
it's
clear
that
what
that
refers
to
are
tributaries.
the
only
thing
excluded
from
the
state
program
are
traditional
navigable
waters
narrowly
defined
as
waters
navigable
in
fact,
navigable
with
improvement,
and
wetlands
adjacent
thereto.
that
leaves
a
vast
array
of
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
as
set
forth
in
prior
statues
in
this
court's
understanding
of
those
terms.
xxx
which
are
tributaries,
primary,
secondary,
tertiary
tributaries.
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out,
what
is
excluded,
we
believe,
are
the
small
proportion
of
waters
that
are
totally
isolated,
that
do
not
flow
into
the
tributaries.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
it
would
not
cover
isolated
waters.
it
clearly
does
allow
states
to
regulate
tributaries,
that
is,
traditional
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states,
under
for
example,
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
or
the
1948
version
of
the
clean
water
act.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
that's
right,
justice
o'connor,
and
the
state
of
alabama
in
its
amicus
brief
set
out
a
long
appendix
with
state
statutes.
it's
clear
that
virtually
all
states,
if
not
all
states,
regulate
isolated
waters
and
protect
them.
here
the
state
of
illinois
and
cook
county
carefully
investigated
our
project
over
many
public
hearings,
over
many
months,
and
concluded
the
project
would
not
impact
the
waters
involved
here
in
any
way.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
this
court's
definition
in
appalachian
electric
of
a
navigable
water
included
one
that
could
be
used
by
small
noncommercial
vessels
on
the
theory
that
that
indicated
the
potential
of
the
water
body
to
be
used
for
commerce,
and
we
are
not
objecting
here
to
the
court's
claim
of
jurisdiction
over
waters
that
are
navigable
in
fact,
even
by
small
vessels.
we
are
objecting
solely
to
the
taking
of
jurisdiction
over
isolated
water
bodies
that
do
not
support
commerce
or
boating
and
that
do
not
flow
into
and
therefore
affect
the
quality
of
navigable
waters
over
which
the
corps
has
always
had
jurisdiction.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
right,
but
we're
not
objecting...
i
mean,
that
is
not
our
case,
justice
stevens,
so
i
can't
claim
to...
you
know,
i
don't
want
to
state
a
definitive
position
on
this.
it's
not
unreasonable
in
our
view
for
the
corps
to
have
regarded
small
lakes
that
support
intrastate
commerce
as
part
of
the
flow
of
commerce
around
the
nation.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
these
ponds
are
very
tiny
and
shallow.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
it's
private
land.
they
have
never
been
used.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
there
are
a
number
of
ponds.
when
i
was
out
three
weeks
ago
there
was
no
water
on
the
land.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
i
think
in
the
record
they
say
several
acres.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
they're
very
shallow.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
the
position
that
the
corps
has
taken,
which
we
do
not
object
to--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--yes,
anything
that
supports...
our
position
essentially
is
anything
that
supports,
could
support
commerce,
and
that
would
include
the
intrastate
portion--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--i
find
that
implausible,
but
that
is
what
the
court
said
in--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--yes,
i
think
you
have
intrastate
waters
if
they
are
navigable,
that
is,
if
a
boat
can
go
on
them
and
move.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
or
if
they
could
prove
that...
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
that's
right,
justice
scalia,
but--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--because
i
believe
there
is
a
connection.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
no.
i
believe
that
when
congress
talks
about
navigable
waters,
particularly
in
the
expanded
sense
that
grew
up
over
the
hundred
years
after
the
daniel
ball,
they
had
in
mind
the
channels
power,
and
that
that's
how
it
reaches
tributaries
and
things
that
affect
the
navigable
waters.
clearly
many
of
the
waters
that
are
covered
under
the
tributaries
language
of
the
statutes
are
not
navigable
in
fact
and
could
not
support
even
a
small
rowboat.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
absolutely
right.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
yes,
i
believe
it's
the
channels
power
under
the
commerce
clause,
but
it
is
not
what
the
government
has
taken
here
which
is
the
effects
of
commerce.
congress
by
1972
knew
very
well
how
to
invoke
the
effects
commerce
power.
it
did
so,
for
example,
in
844(a)
of
the
criminal
code,
which
this
court
considered
in
lopez,
where
it
specifically
invoked
that
power.
it
did
not
do
so
in
the
clean
water
act.
it
used
these
traditional
terms,
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states,
and
under
any
plausible
understanding
of
those
terms,
historical
or
just
common
sense,
and
certainly
reading
the
legislative
history,
there
is
absolutely
no
indication
that
congress
meant
to
reach
isolated
ponds
that
can
have
no
affect
on
the
quality
of
navigable
waters.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
no,
you
are
right,
but
the
statute
does
not
define
the
limits
of
what
is
being
allotted
to
the
states.
the
corps...
congress
is
only
allotting
to
the
states
that
which
is
left
over
from
the
404
permit
program
once
traditional
navigable
waters
have
been
taken
out.
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
nothing
else
in
the
statute
that
gives
the
federal
government
power
over
isolated
waters
with
no
impact
on
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states,
and
therefore
the
only
thing
that
404(g)(1)
reaches
are
the
tributaries
which
are
part
of
the
navigable
waters
but
which
are
not
part
of
the
traditional
corps
meaning
of
navigable
waters
in
the
daniel
ball,
appalachian
electric
sense.
that
seems
like...
i
mean,
the
statute
does
not
say
isolated
waters;
there
is
nothing
in
there
that
even
hints
that
isolated
waters
are
part
of
what
is
left
over.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
wetlands
adjacent
to
waters
that
are
navigable
in
fact
or
navigable
with
improvements,
not
waters
that
are...
wetlands
that
are
adjacent
to
tributaries,
which
are
left
to
the
states.
that
leaves
an
enormous
amount
of
regulatory
power
to
the
states
over
tributaries
and
their
adjacent
wetlands,
but
nothing
in
there
suggests
in
the
least
that
isolated
waters
are
included
in
that
package,
and
isolated
waters
are
traditionally
regulated
by
the
states
anyway.
there
are
principles
of
statutory
interpretation
here
that
even
if
there
were
any
ambiguity
in
the
statutory
language,
which
we
don't
believe
there
is,
there
are
principles
of
statutory
interpretation
which
require,
we
believe,
our
reading
as
opposed
to
the
government's.
the
first
of
those
is
the
debartolo
principle
that
a
statute
or
in
this
case
a
regulation,
the
bird
rule
should
not
be
read
so
as
to
create
constitutional
problems.
whatever
one's
conclusion
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
bird
rule,
it
seems
beyond
question
that
it
does
raise
serious
questions.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
i
believe
that
that
regulation,
justice
o'connor,
does
not
satisfy
our
view
of
the
statutory
language
and
therefore
should
be
set
aside.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
right,
the
one
defining
waters
of
the
united
states.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
that
is
true,
it
does
not.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
what
it
does
is
to
extend
the
government's
jurisdiction
to
the
limits
of
the
effects
commerce
power.
we
don't
believe
that
that's
what
the
clean
water
act
says.
now,
having
said
that
i
would
like
to
add,
however,
that
the
only--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--well,
the
government
has...
the
sole
basis
on
which
the
government
has
claimed
jurisdiction
in
this
case
during
the
past...
since
1987
when
all
this
started
is
the
bird
rule.
they
have
never
mentioned
another
rule.
in
their
brief--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--the
sole
basis
is
the
migratory
bird
rule.
that
is
what
they
stated
when
they
took
jurisdiction
in
the
first
place.
it
is
the
only
basis
of
jurisdiction
that
is
stated
in
the
404
permit
denials.
having
said
that,
we
obviously
don't
want
to
go
back
down
and
find
ourselves
caught
on
some
other
provision
of
the
other
waters
regulation.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
other
waters
regulation
is
wholly
inconsistent
insofar
as
it
reaches
any
water,
any
isolated
water
that
has
any
conceivable
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
that
is
incompatible
with
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history,
and
so
although
we...
the
migratory
bird
rule
is
the
only
basis
on
which
jurisdiction
has
been
asserted
in
their
briefs
to
this
court,
the
government
does
retreat
from
that
and
rely
on
the
activity
itself,
which
i
think
is
an
intent
to
rely
on
the
other
waters
regulation.
and
so
we
would
like
the
court
to
address
that
to
save
another
30
million
in
public
money
which
is
what
we
spent
dealing
with
the
corps
for
the
last
13
years.
i
was
talking
about
the
principles
of
statutory
regulation
which
we
think
support
our
interpretation.
one
is
the
debartolo
principle,
but
a
second
one
and
one
the
congress
had
very
much
in
mind
as
section
101(b)
of
the
statute
makes
clear
is
that
it
was
concerned
not
to
trample
state
powers
over
land
use
and
over
the
environment,
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
that
trampling
occurred
here.
the
corps
put
together
a
47,000-page
record
over
the
course
of
seven
years
of
permitting,
and
in
doing
so
overrode
the
considered
determinations
of
the
state
of
illinois
and
cook
county.
when
it
does
a
404
determination,
once
it
has
taken
jurisdiction,
it
doesn't
just
keep
its
eyes
on
the
isolated
waters.
it
roams
far
and
wide,
using
a
public
interest
standard.
the
elements
of
that
public
interest
standard
include,
for
example,
whether
the
project
meets
the
needs
and
welfare,
the
general
needs
and
welfare
of
the
people.
it
includes
review
of
economics,
aesthetics,
an
array
of
other
things.
it
is
general
land
use
regulation
at
that
point,
and
we
believe
that
that
is
both
inconsistent
to
stretch
the
jurisdiction
as
the
corps
has
through
its
rules,
to
stretch
the
jurisdiction
to
impinge
on
state
regulation
in
the
face
of
a
clear
statement
in
the
preamble
of
the
statute
that
congress
intended,
had
a
policy
to
preserve
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
state
and
local
government
over
these
matters,
and
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
clear
statement
principle
that
this
court
has
applied
which
requires
that
if
congress
is
going
to
impinge
on
the
reserved
rights
of
the
states
that
it
should
say
so
clearly.
far
from
saying
so
clearly
in
this
case,
it
said
that
it
wished
to
preserve
to
the
extent
possible
the
rights
of
the
states.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
101(b),
your
honor,
section
101(b),
1251(b),
which
is
probably
quoted
on
the
first
page
of
our
blue
brief.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
the
policy
of
congress
to
recognize,
preserve,
and
protect
the
primary
responsibilities
and
rights
of
states
to
prevent,
reduce,
and
eliminate
pollution
and
to
plan
the
development
and
use
of
land
and
water
resources.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
i
don't
believe
that
the
federal
government
may
regulate
these
ponds
under
the
interstate--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--not
under
the
commerce
clause,
but
they
clearly
can
use
treaty
power.
you
have
to
understand
that
birds
are--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--west
nile
disease
is
spread
by
birds
and
kills
birds,
and
under
the
migratory
bird
treaty
act
congress
can
clearly
take
birds
by--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--congress
can
certainly
regulate
anything
that
is
commercial,
including--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--exactly,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
yes,
justice
scalia.
there
is
no--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--and
if
you
can
find
a
commerce
connection,
for
example,
because
the
product--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--if
there
is
no
commerce
connection,
the
answer
is
no.
and
the
framers
of
the
constitution
did
not
intend
that
the
federal
government
have
power
over
every
problem
just
because
it
was
national
in
scope.
it
intended
that
the
states
have
reserve
powers
to
deal
with
problems
as
well,
and--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--well,
but
i
don't
think
that
substantial
effects
on
an
end
user...
here
the
claim
is
that
the
birds,
because
they
fly
interstate
and
at
some
point
may
get
shot
by
or
watched
by
people
who
are
crossing
state
lines
and
spending
money,
that
is
a
sufficient
interstate
commerce
connection.
if
that
connection--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--that
doesn't
seem
very
different
to
me.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
that
doesn't
seem
very
different
to
me
from
the
hypothetical.
but
some
end
user
commerce
connection
is
not
enough.
if
you
get
there
then
there
are
no
reserve
powers
left
to
the
states,
everything
is
within
the
enumerated
powers.
if
i
could,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
justice
o'connor,
the
state
of
illinois
rejected
our
first
permit
application,
made
us
reapply.
we
filed
a
1700-page
application,
there
were
an
additional
set
of
public
hearings.
they
subjected
the
project
to
51
conditions
before
they
would
let
us
proceed.
cook
county
engaged
in
the
largest,
longest
permit
proceeding
it
had
ever
engaged
in
over
this
project.
let
me
say
that
the
act
is
not
open
ended.
it's
not
that
any
connection
will
do.
the
corps...
and
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
on
the
other
side
from
the
wetland
scientists
claims
that
isolated
ponds
are
in
fact
somehow
connected
on
the
surface
or
through
groundwater
to
the
navigable
waters,
but
the
fact
is
any
change
made
in
the
landscape
will
make
some...
have
some
effect
on
the
flow
of
water.
i
just
switched
the
gutter
on
my
garage
so
that
it
drains
onto
an
impermeable
surface
where
the
water
evaporates
rather
than
onto
the
garden
where
it
goes
down
into
our
water
table
and
ends
up
in
lake
michigan.
the
corps
cannot
use
this
language
which
requires
some
physical
connection
to
the
navigable
waters
to
extend
its
jurisdiction
in
the
same
way
that
it's
now
extending
it
endlessly
through
the
effects
commerce
strand
of
the
commerce
power,
so...
and
as
to
groundwater,
i
did
not
and
certainly
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
the
corps
can
regulate
any
water
that
flows
into
groundwater.
the
law
is
clear
in
the
7th
circuit
that
the
corps
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
groundwater.
other
courts,
the
5th
circuit,
for
example,
has
held
that
if
the
groundwater
recharges
surface
water,
there's
jurisdiction.
that's
simply
an
issue
that
is
not
in
this
case,
and
i
do
not
concede
that
if
there
is
any
connection
to
the
groundwater
here
that
that
would
be
jurisdictional.
and
the
record
in
this
case
which
is
47,000
pages
long
contains
no
basis
of
jurisdiction,
no
sourcible
authority
at
all
other
than
presence
of
migratory
birds
on
these
waters.
the
parade
of
horrors
that
mr.
wallace
has
trotted
out
should
also
not
be
believed.
the
clean
water
act
is
not
out
there
by
itself
protecting
clean
water,
or
birds.
the
migratory
bird
treaty
act
which
is
authorized
under
the
treaty
power
gives
congress
the
authority
to
protect
birds
and
their
habitats.
the
spending
power
has
been
used
to
great
effect
in
the
prairie
potholes
region
whereas
this
court
considered
in
the
south
dakota
case,
the
federal
government
has
either
acquired
outright
or
bought
easements
over
more
than
a
million
acres,
and
this
is
20
years
ago,
more
than
a
million
acres
of
prairie
potholes.
so
taking
out
this
strand,
the
bird
rule
and
the
other
waters
rule,
this
strand
from
the
corps'
jurisdiction
will
have
and
should
have
no
impact
on
what
congress
can
do
under
the
other
statutes.
if
you
address
this
case
as
a
statutory
rather
than
a
constitutional
case,
it
would
also
want
to
address
the
question
whether
congress
can
come
back
with
a
different
plan
to
protect
clean
waters.
what
we
don't
believe
the
government
can
plausibly
assert
is
that
the
terms
navigable
waters
defined
as
waters
of
the
united
states,
given
the
history,
given
the
legislative
history,
given
the
historical
usage
of
those
terms,
in
this
court
and
other
statutes,
extends
to
isolated
ponds
regulated
by
the
states.
and
finally
on
the...
as
to
the
rule
of
lenity,
i
would
recommend
that
the
court
follow
the--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--thank
you,
chief
justice.
