g.

i
can
understand.
i
don't
think...
i
can
understand
the
position
that
says
waters
of
the
united
states
means
the
navigable
waters,
but
that's
not
your
position.
you're
saying
it
includes
anything
that
flows
into
navigable
waters.
i
could
understand
the
position
that
says
waters
of
the
united
states
means
whatever
congress
can
legislate
on
under
the
commerce
clause,
but
that's
not
your
position.
that's
their
position.
what
i
don't
understand
is
the
position
which,
i
take
it
is
yours,
which
says
that
all
nonnavigable
waters
which
flow
into
a
navigable
water
is
within
the
statute,
and
that
apparently
according
to
the
amici
brief,
is
about
80
percent
of
every
backyard
pond.
but
those
which
flow
into
waters
under
the
ground
rather
than
over
the
ground
which
i
guess
are
excluded
on
your
theory,
just
because
they
go
under
the
ground.
that
isn't
the
small
ones;
that
includes
crater
lake,
the
great
salt
lake,
huge
bodies
of
water.
it
isn't
the
big
ones.
it's
some
small
ones,
some
big
ones,
80
percent,
the
only
difference
being
that
they
happen
to
flow
into
the
stream
that's
navigable
under
the
ground
rather
than
over
the
ground.
so
what
conceivably
could
congress
have
had
in
mind
on
your
interpretation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
you're
even
saying
that
some
of
the
ones
that
go
under
the
ground
are
within
the
statute,
but
others
aren't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
into
the
fox
river,
isn't
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
question
you
see,
is
i
can
understand
their
interpretation,
i
can
understand
a
narrow
interpretation,
but
i
don't
understand
what
any
human
being
would
want
to
accomplish
by
writing
your
interpretation
that
would
in
fact
exclude
somewhere
between
5
and
20
percent
of
the
bodies
of
water
in
people's
backyards.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
congress
regulate
these
ponds
to
prevent
them
from
serving
as
nesting
places,
say
for
mosquitos
that
carry
west
nile
disease
from
state
to
state?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
instead
of...
if
they
discovered
that
mosquitos
are
flying
all
over
the
place,
infect
birds,
and
people
are
dying
in
different
states
because
of
a
pond
that
is
not
appropriately
sprayed,
congress
lacks
the
power
in
your
view
to
tell
the
states
or
to
tell
individuals
to
spray
their
ponds
or
not
to
use
certain
pesticides
that
are
killing
people
in
other
states.
do
they
have
that
power?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i'm
talking
about
under
my
hypothetical;
there
is
no
treaty,
as
i
know,
on
west
nile
disease
mosquitos?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
trying
to
ask
with
my
question,
if
you
can
just...
suppose
that
it's
discovered
that
birds
are
causing
diseases
or
suppose
that
pesticides
are
dangerous
to
people.
can
congress
tell
you
that
you
cannot
use
a
certain
pesticide
in
your
backyard
pond
or
your
backyard
tree
because
the
effect
of
that
is
to
spread
disease
from
state
to
state?
do
they
have
that
power?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
said
what
the
hypothetical
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mr.
wallace,
how...
i'm
trying
to
get
a
quantitative
idea
from
what
one
of
the
amici
briefs
suggested.
your
view
is
that
all
the
water
that
affects
interstate
commerce,
maybe
the
word
is
substantially
affects
or
significantly
affects,
whatever
the
constitutional
test,
but
think
of
that
set
of
water,
all
the
water
that
significantly
affects
interstate
commerce
is
included.
i
take
it
that
they
agree
that
all
the
water
that
affects
interstate
commerce
is
included
provided
it
also
is
either
navigable
or
if
not
navigable,
it
flows
into
navigable
water,
and
i
thought
they
were
talking
about
flows
on
the
surface.
there
is
an
amicus
brief
that
says
well,
there
is
only
about
20
percent
left
over.
is
that
right?
now,
i
think
maybe
today...
i'm
not
sure.
i
think
maybe
they
said
it
also
includes
the
water
affecting
interstate
commerce
that
isn't
navigable
but
flows
underground,
in
which
case
i
would
think
that
takes
care
of
everything
else.
maybe
there
is
a
tiny
little
bit
that
actually
doesn't
flow
underground,
and
i
take
think
it
this
particular
place,
the
army
corps
of
engineers
and
the
epa
think
it
does
flow
into
the
fox
river
underground,
and
they
think
it
doesn't
flow
into
the
fox
river
underground,
so
i'm
not
sure
what
we're
supposed
to
do.
i'm
trying
to
get
an
idea
of
what
the...
what
we're
talking
about.
