two
feet
deep,
i'm
told.
unknown
speaker
so
what
is
the
source
of
the
congress'
authority
over
navigable
waters?
is
it
the
commerce
clause?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bishop,
i
don't
mean
to
belabor
this
but
i'm
looking
at
the
text
of
404(g),
and
it
seems
that
this
provision
addresses
permits
on
the
application
of
the
governor
of
any
state
to
things
that
are
not
navigable
waters,
not
tributaries,
not
adjacent
wetlands.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
quite
understand.
the
sole
basis
is
what,
mr.
bishop?
unknown
speaker
first
page
of
the
blue
brief?
unknown
speaker
my
question
is
whether
or
not
congress
has
the
power
to
regulate
local
products
in
local
ponds
on
local
trees
that
would
spread
diseases
from
one
state
to
another.
unknown
speaker
that's
true,
but
unlike
those
other
statutes,
this
one
is
limited
to
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
as
defined
in
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
the
assertion
was
that
if
there
was
no
commerce
clause
connection,
it
would
be
unconstitutional,
and
that's
what
the
discussion
was
about,
a
sufficient
commerce
clause
connection.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
when
a
justice
is
asking
you
a
question,
i
suggest
you
remain
quiet
until
he
finishes,
if
that
isn't
too
much
trouble.
--thank
you.
unknown
speaker
do
the
states
exercise
any
regulation
over
the
prairie
potholes?
