but
why
isn't
there
going
to
be
a
commerce
connection?
i
mean
apart
from
the
chief
justice's
suggestion,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
hypothetical
that
justice
breyer
throws
out
is
a
pretty
good
predicate
to
substantial
effects
on
commerce.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
think
that
was
the
hypothetical,
was
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
wasn't
the
hypothetical.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
that
a
serious
problem
then
under
any
clear
statement
analysis?
i
understand,
i
think
i
understand
your
argument,
and
i
can
see
that
it
is
possible
to
construe
the
language
as
broadly
as
you
do,
but
when
literally
any
farm
pond
in
the
united
states
is
going
to
be
subject
to
corps
jurisdiction
on
your
analysis
and
congress
has
not
spoken
any
more
clearly
than
it
has
here,
isn't
that
a
reason
for
construing
the
statute
more
narrowly
rather
than
as
broadly
as
you
are
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
a
good
reason.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
do
here
seem
to
have...
and
maybe
we
did
there
for
that
matter,
but
we
seem
at
least
to
have
a
conflict
in
principle
because
we
have
the
deference
principle
and
then
we
have
some
clear
statement
notion
when
the
results
get
to
the,
sort
of
to
the
bizarre
point.
so
which
principle
do
we
choose?
