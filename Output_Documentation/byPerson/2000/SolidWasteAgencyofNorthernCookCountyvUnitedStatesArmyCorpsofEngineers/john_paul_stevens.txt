justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
quite
understand
your
position
as
to
why
if
it's
a
small
lake
entirely
within
the
boundaries
of
the
state
that
you
don't
object
to
federal
jurisdiction
there.
even
if
it's
navigable,
that's
not
interstate
commerce,
it's
local
commerce.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
this
case
be
different
if
the
united
states
could
prove
that
people
used
rowboats
to
go
fishing
in
the
pond
that
we're
talking
about
here?
it's
several
acres
in
size,
i
think,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
big
is
the
pond
we're
talking
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
big
is
the
biggest
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
several
acres.
so
you
could
row
back
and
forth
across
that
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
could,
would
that
make
a
difference
to
you?
say
it
was
ten
feet
deep
instead
of
two
feet
deep,
and
people
regularly
went
out
in
rowboats
in
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
asking
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
asking
specifically,
if
it
can
support
people
going
out
in
a
rowboat
and
rowing
back
and
forth
across
the
lake,
that
would
be
sufficient
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
would
like
to
get
an
answer
to
my
question,
if
you
could
please.
what
is
your
view
on
that
hypothetical?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
would
be
a
different
case
if
the
government
could
prove
that
rowboats
could
go
back
and
forth
across
the
water?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
had
the
epa
taken
this
position
before
1977?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
that
position
was
in
a
regulation
at
the
time
congress
acted
in
1977?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
point
of
the
footnote,
as
i
remember
it
was,
if
the
matter
is
cleared
up
in
the
civil
proceedings,
then
the
rule
of
lenity
doesn't
apply
subsequently
because
there
is
no
longer
the
ambiguity
that
gives
rise
to
the
rule
of
lenity
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
just
to
be
clear
on
one
thing,
it
is
the
corps'
position,
is
it
not,
that
the
phase
iii
water,
their
power
to
regulate
the
phase
iii
water
applies
whether
or
not
the
isolated
ponds
have
an
underground
connection
to
navigable
waters?
