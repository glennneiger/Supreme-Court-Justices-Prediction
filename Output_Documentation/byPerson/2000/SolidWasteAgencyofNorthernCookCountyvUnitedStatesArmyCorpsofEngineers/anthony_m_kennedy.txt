justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
we
ever
used
the
term
waters
of
the
states
or
has
congress
ever
used
the
term
waters
of
the
states?
it
would
seem
there
might
be
a
dichotomy
there;
i'm
not
sure
that
it
necessarily
follows.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
mean,
this
case,
it
seems
to
me,
does
point
up
the
problem
that
petitioner's
counsel
raised
quoting
from
page
1
of
the
blue
brief,
it
is
the
primary
responsibility
of
the
states
to
eliminate
pollution
and
to
plan
development
and
use
of
land.
here
you
have
a
47,000-page
report,
did
i
hear
that
correctly,
that
the
corps
of
engineers
issued?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
this
illustrates
that
the
way
in
which
the
corps
has
promulgated
its
regulation
departs
from
the
design
of
the
statute.
