mr.
bishop,
if
that's
so,
then
how
do
you
explain
section
404(g)
of
the
statute,
which
allows
the
states'
governments
to
submit
to
the
epa
a
description
of
a
program
involving
discharging
into
waters
that
are
other
than
navigable
or
adjacent
to
navigable
waters?
why
would
congress
give
the
governors
permission
to
do
that
if
those
waters
are
excluded?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
404(g)
would
not
cover
such--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
seem,
this
section
seems
to
fit
the
category
that
you
say
is
outside
the
statute.
perhaps
you
can
look
at
the
text
of
404(g)
and
show
me
where
i
am
wrong.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
adjacent
wetlands
are
not
left
over
because
that's
specifically
mentioned--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
where
are
the
words
that
say
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace,
if
you
would
turn
to
the
language
in
riverside
bayview
that
you
cited
in
passing,
that
does
say
that
the
word
navigable
in
this
statute
has
a,
quote,
limited
office.
as
i
understand
what
you're
telling
us
now,
which
you
put
forward
in
your
brief,
it
has
no
office
at
all,
that
the
statute
would
mean
what
you
say
it
means
if
the
term
navigable
were
not
in
there
so
that
you
give
no
effect
whatever
to
that
term.
am
i
correct
in
so
understanding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
does
it
have
to
do?
in
other
words,
would
the
statute
do
anything
more
or
less
in
your
view
if
the
word
navigable
were
not
there
and
there
were
just
the
words
waters
of
the
united
states?
in
other
words,
does
navigable
have
any
function
whatever,
not
has
it
been
defined
away?
