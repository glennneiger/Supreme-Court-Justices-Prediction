mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
clean
water
act
states
its
goals
as
to
restore
and
maintain
the
chemical,
physical,
and
biological
integrity
of
the
nation's
waters
and
to
attain
water
quality
which
provides
for
the
protection
and
propagation
of
fish,
shellfish,
and
wildlife.
the
operative
provisions
at
issue
here
prohibit
discharges
of
pollutants
into
certain
waters...
we'll
get
into
what
those
are
in
just
a
moment...
without
a
permit.
those
provisions
regulate
human
conduct,
usually
commercial
in
nature,
and
certainly
commercial
in
this
instance,
in
order
to
avert
harm
to
natural
resources,
wildlife,
or
the
environment,
and
in
common
with
similar
antipollution
provisions
in
other
federal
environmental
statutes,
these
prohibitions
on
conduct
do
not
purport
to
assert
any
special
federal
domain
over
the
place
where
the
conduct
occurs.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
for
example,
in
the
act
commonly
known
as
rcra,
another
environmental
statute,
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act,
a
permit
situation,
a
permit
system
is
set
up
for
the
treatment,
storage
or
disposal
of
hazardous
waste,
which
occurs
in
privately
owned
land
ordinarily,
without
any
reference
to
waters
whatsoever.
the
endangered
species
act
prohibits
harm
to
the
protected
species,
whether
that
occurs
on
land
or
water.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
am
saying
there
are
many
prohibitions
on
conduct
that
pollutes
or
endangers
the
natural
resources
of
this
country
or
the
wildlife
of
this
country
that
are
enacted
under
the
commerce
power
and
that
are
not
commonly
thought
of
or
thought
of
in
the
law
as
asserting
a
special
federal
domain
over
the
place
where
the
conduct
occurs.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
as
defined
in
the
statute,
that's--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that's
exactly
what
i'm
going
to
turn
to
now,
but
i
have
to
speak
first,
as
i
tried
to
do,
to
the
argument
that
there
would
be
a
constitutional
problem
if
the
conduct
prohibited
occurred
in
one
place
rather
than
another.
the
conduct--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
guess--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
sorry.
i'm
just
trying
to
help
with
the
inquiry.
i'm
sorry.
in
any
event,
let's
turn
now
to
the
question
of
what
waters
the
statute
addresses.
the
first
thing
to
be
said
about
this
question,
before
turning
to
the
statute,
is
that
this
court
has
already
spoken
to
this
issue,
not
in
detail,
but
quite
clearly
in
an
opinion
in
which
it
was
an
important
part
of
the
court's
reasoning,
and
i'm
speaking
of
a
carefully
crafted
opinion
of
the
court
in
international
paper
company
against
ouellette
which
dealt
with
a
very
difficult
issue.
this
is
in
479
u.s.,
which
dealt
with
a
very
difficult
issue
of
implied
preemption
under
the
act
in
light
of
the
meaning
of
two
savings
clauses.
and
an
important
part
of
the
reasoning
of
the
court
in
concluding
the
scope
of
preemption
of
escape
based
causes
of
action,
it
happened
to
be
a
challenge
to
a
discharge
that
caused
harm
in
an
adjoining
state,
but
an
important
part
of
the
court's
reasoning
was
consideration
of
the
comprehensive
scope
of
the
clean
water
act.
and
the
court
stated
at
page
486
of
479
u.s.
in
describing
the
case
first
that
the
act
applies
to
virtually
all
surface
water
in
the
country,
and
it
had
a
footnote
at
that
point
citing
its
decision
from
the
previous
term
in
riverside
bayview
homes
which
had
described
the
corps'
regulations
that
extended
to
isolated
waters
so
called.
and
then
in
the
legal
discussion
in
its
opinion
several
pages
later
at
479
u.s.
page
493,
the
court
reasoned,
as
we
noted
in
milwaukee
2,
congress
intended
the
1972
act
amendments
to
establish,
quote,
an
all
encompassing
program
of
water
pollution
regulation,
unquote.
the
act
applies
to
all
point
sources
and
virtually
all
bodies
of
water,
and
it
sets
forth
the
procedures
for
obtaining
a
permit
in
great
detail.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
term
is
defined
in
the
statute,
so
it
has
effect
as
a
reference
to
the
definition,
but
it's
a
term
of
art
in
the
statute,
and
it's
defined
as
waters--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
believe
the
answer
is
that
the
use
of
the
word
navigable
in
the
statute,
as
a
reference
to
the
definition
of
what
navigable
means
for
purposes
of
the
statute,
does
not
have
any
independent
significance.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
word
navigable
appears
in
the
statute
in
that
spot
but
not
elsewhere.
the
statute
does
not
deal
with
navigability
problems.
the
statute
deals
with
a
water
pollution
crisis
that
was--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
this
is
the
main
law
governing
conduct
that
pollutes
surface
waters
in
this
country,
and
it's
comparable
to
the
safe
drinking
water
act
which
protects
aquifers
and
underground
waters
more
directly.
but
to
answer
your
question
more
directly,
as
we
explained
in
discussing
the
'72
act
and
then
the
1977
amendments,
the
act
started
off
and
was
called
the
federal
water
pollution
control
amendments
of
1972,
and
it
used
the
definition
navigable
waters,
which
was
left
over
from
prior
legislation,
including
the
rivers
and
harbors
act,
but
in
the
course
of
the
development
of
the
'72
act,
dissatisfaction
was
expressed
with
the
idea
that
the
act
would
apply
too
narrowly
and
the
definition
of
navigable
waters
was
changed
from
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
to
just
the
words
waters
of
the
united
states,
and
the
committee
report
reporting
it
out
at
that
time
said
it
was
meant
to
exert
the
full
constitutional
authority
of
the
congress
under
the
commerce
power.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
can
be
said
quite
plainly,
i
mean,
congress
could
have
spoken
with
greater
clarity
than
it
did.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
arguably
is
a
reason,
although
the
court
in
riverside
bayview--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--said
the
deference
to
the
corps'
interpretation
was
appropriate,
because
congress
had
not
directly
spoken
to
the
issue.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
have
to
take
issue
with
whether
the
result
here
gets
to
a
bizarre
point
that
implicates
a
clear
statement
rule,
but
i
do
think
that
we're
talking
precisely
on
the
issue
on
which
congress
focused
in
the
1977
amendments
to
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
did
not
interpret
it
this
way
originally
but
were
reprimanded
by
several
court
decisions
for
misinterpreting
the
act.
epa,
which
has
the
primary
authority
to
interpret
the
act,
did
interpret
it
this
way
originally,
and
the
corps
came
around
after
conducting
another
rulemaking
proceeding
as
it
was
ordered
to
do
by
a
court
that
had
said
its
view
of
the
authority
was
too
narrow
to
accomplish
the
purposes
of
the
act
that
congress
had
in
mind,
and
the
two
agencies
reached
the
same
conclusion
by
the
time
congress
was
considering
the
1977
amendments
which
focused
very
specifically
on
the
question
of
whether
the
jurisdiction
over
so
called
isolated
waters
had
gone
too
far.
the
house
of
representatives--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
and
it
was
also
in
the
interim
rule
that
the
corps
had
come
to,
and
indeed
the
corps
adopted
its
final
rule
during
the
course
of
consideration
after
the
house
had
passed
its
bill
but
before
the
senate
had
voted.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
was
an
issue
that
the
court
addressed
in
its
opinion
in
babbitt
versus
sweet
home
in
footnote
18
of
that
opinion,
where
in
a
civil
proceeding
a
similar
concern
was
raised.
and
i
think
the
answer
given
in
that
footnote
that
in
a
civil
context
of
litigation
where
the
agency
interpretation
has
been
made
clear,
that
there's
no
occasion
to
invoke
the
rule
of
lenity.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
don't
take
that
position.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
a
footnote
by
this
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
do
have
mens
rea
questions
that
we
and
the
courts
have
been
struggling
with.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
very
well
restated.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we're
very
cautious
about
not
bringing
what
we
think
would
be
an
unfair
criminal
prosecution.
we're
mostly...
we
mostly
try
to
confine
those
initiatives
to
scofflaw
situations
where
we
think
that
we
could
prevail
and
where
that
kind
of
sanction
is
appropriate.
but
to
get
back
to
the
1977
controversy,
the
house
did
pass
a
bill,
and
a
similar
bill
was
sponsored
by
senator
bentsen
in
the
senate,
but
both
bills
made
clear
that
they
were
not
repudiating
the
broader
scope
of
authority
for
epa
in
regulating
toxic
discharges
into
all
waters
of
the
united
states
as
they
had
been
interpreted
in
the
regulations,
but
only
addressed
the
corps'
permitting
activities
with
respect
to
dredge
and
fill
activities.
the
congress
indicated
in
detail
that
it
was
very
familiar
with
the
agency
interpretations
by
both
agencies,
and
even
then
the
senate
refused
to
pass
the
house
version
or
the
bentsen
amendment,
and
it
decided
instead
to
retain
the
existing
scope
of
the
geographic
authority
stated
in
the
regulations
that
had
been
adopted,
but
to
counterbalance
that
with
this
new
provision
that
justice
ginsburg
has
been
averting
to,
404(g),
which
provided
authority
for
the
states
to
adopt
their
own
programs
over
what
were
called
in
the
corps'
new
regulation
and
the
senate
report,
very
specifically
referred
to
this
as
phase
ii
and
phase
iii
of
the
expansion
of
the
corps'
permit
program,
and
we
have
quoted
the
senate
report
that
uses
precisely
those
terms
on
page
25
of
our
brief.
the
committee
amendment
does
not
redefine
navigable
waters.
instead,
the
committee
amendment
intends
to
assure
continued
protection
of
all
the
nation's
waters
but
allows
states
to
assume
the
primary
responsibility
for
protecting
the
waters
outside
of
the
so
called
phase
i
waters,
which
are
the
navigable
waters
and
those
adjacent
and
then
the
wetlands
adjacent
thereto.
under
the
committee
amendment
the
corps
will
continue
to
administer
the
entire
section
404
program
in
all
navigable
waters
until
the
approval
of
a
state
program
for
phase
ii
and
phase
iii
waters,
and
the
phase
iii
waters
which
the
corps
was
planning
to
get
to
in
a
couple
of
years
time
are
the
waters
at
issue
here.
so
the
whole
premise
of
the
senate
bill,
which
is
what
the
conference
committee
adopted,
was
that
the
extension
of
jurisdiction
to
these
phase
iii
waters
would
be
retained,
but
the
states
would
be
given
the
option
of
administering
the
program.
two
states
have
chosen
to
do
that,
new
jersey
and
michigan.
new
jersey
was
one
of
eight
states
that
have
filed
a
brief
in
our
support
in
this
case.
only
one
has
filed
a
brief
on
the
other
side,
i
hasten
to
point
out.
and
the
senate
also
counterbalanced
the
retention
of
the
broad
jurisdiction
by
providing
for
certain
exemptions,
including
an
exemption
of
certain
agricultural
activities
because
of
precisely
the
concern
that
justice
souter
suggested
might
raise
a
question
of
bizarre
authority
and
also
have--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
in
the
statute.
that
was
part
of
the
1977
amendments
that
certain
exemptions
were
added.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
yes,
it
is.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
section
1344(f)
of
title
33.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
one
of
the
rules
specified
by
the
corps
in
its
elaboration
of
its
regulations
as
to
what
waters
can
affect
interstate
commerce
are
those
that
are
used
as
habitat
by
migratory
birds
protected
under
bird
treaty
acts
or
that
migrate
between
the
states,
which
happened
to
be
the
basis
on
which
jurisdiction
was
asserted
here,
on
the
basis
of
the
factual
showing
that
was
made
to
the
corps
by
an
illinois
state
agency
dealing
with
birds.
and
perhaps
if
we
get
away
from
this
particular
cite
for
a
moment,
much
of
the
battle
would
be
about
the
so
called
prairie
potholes
in
the
dakotas
and
adjoining
states
where
about
50
percent
of
the
waterfowl
in
this
country
breed.
under
petitioner's
position,
as
i
understand
it,
the
commerce
power
would
enable
congress
to
protect
the
winter
habitat
of
duck
species
and
other
waterfowl
in
the
chesapeake
bay
area
with
all
of
its
tidal
waters
and
navigable
rivers
and
et
cetera,
but
not
to
protect
the
summer
breeding
habitat
of
these
same
waterfowl.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
a
statutory
argument,
but
he
also
is
making
the
argument
that
that
interpretation
is
one
that
should
be
adopted
because
otherwise
there
would
be
constitutional
doubt
about
the
authority
of
congress
to
protect
this
bird
habitat,
and
of
course
any
scientist
would
look
at
this
question
and
say,
well,
it's
futile,
it's
ineffectual
to
be
able
to
protect
the
habitat
that
they
use
in
one
season
but
not
to
be
able
to
protect
the
habitat
that
they
use
in
another
season,
the
breeding
season.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
and
the
so
called
prairie
potholes
are
perhaps
the
prime
example
of
that.
the
waters
here,
that's
a
more
difficult
inquiry.
certainly
they
serve
as
storage
for
what
would
otherwise
be
flood
waters
during
periods
of
heavy
rain
that
would
cause
overflow.
that
was
part
of
what
the
corps
had
to
deal
with
in
dealing
with
this
application.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
do.
this
whole
area
is
one
of
concurrent
and
overlapping
authority
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government,
as
the
states
that
have
filed
amicus
in
our
support
have
pointed
out.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
exactly
contrary
to
what
the
senate
committee
said
in
adopting
the
1977
amendments.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
was
a
very--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
the
corps
grants
all
but
less
than
one
percent
of
applications
each
year,
and
about
85
percent
of
the
permits
that
it
issues
are
issued
under
general
permit
programs
which
are
streamlined
and
do
not
require
individual
inquiries
into
the
categories
that
they
fall,
if
certain
conditions
are
met
in
the
application.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
what
we
had
in
this
case
was
what
turned
out
to
be
a
very
complex
inquiry,
although
petitioner
characterizes
that
it's
trenching
on
local
land
use
planning
functions,
but
local
land
use
boards
seldom
have
to
deal
with
a
project
of
this
magnitude,
and
its
potential
and
long
range
effects
on
the
people
who
will
be
affected
by
it
in
their
posterity,
which
is
why
the
states
supporting
us
say
that
the
special
expertise
of
the
corps
and
of
the
other
agencies,
state
and
federal,
that
weighed
in
in
this
process,
and
of
course
responses
were
received
from
petitioner
and
its
supporters,
were
so
important,
because
what
was
implicated
here
was
not
only
dangers
to
migratory
birds
but
a
question
of
possible
contamination
of
an
aquifer
used
by
thousands
of
people
for
their
drinking
water.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
state
agencies
participated
in
the
corps
proceeding.
it's
true
that
they
initially
licensed
a
plan
to
which
many
mitigation
measures
were
added
by
the
state
so
that
the
plan
would
have
been
a
much
better
one
if
the
corps
had
approved
it
than
what
petitioner
started
with.
