mr.
bishop,
the
government
says
that
the...
while
you
may
be
correct
about
the
perception
of
what
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
consist
of,
that
there
was
no
practice
of
referring
to
that
conception
as
waters
of
the
united
states.
do
you
have
instances--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
the
statutory
text
or
in
our
opinions
where
that
precise
phrase
that's
used
in
the
definition
here,
waters
of
the
united
states,
is
used?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
see
why
you
keep
referring
to,
you
know,
supporting
interstate
commerce.
i
thought
the
whole
core
of
your
case
is
that
when
you
referred
to
navigable
waters,
you're
not
talking
about
interstate
commerce,
that
there
is
one
basis
of
jurisdiction
which
is
the
commerce
clause,
and
there
is
another
basis
of
jurisdiction
which
is
navigable
waters,
and
if
you
interpret
navigable
waters
to
mean
waters
that
are
navigable,
whether
they
are
navigable
interstate
or
not,
it
would
necessarily
include
lakes
big
enough
to
float
a
rowboat.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
keep
referring
to
interstate
commerce?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
part
of
the
navigable
waters
clause?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
affect
navigable
waters,
and
so
congress'
authority
over
the
navigable
waters,
presumably
gives
the
congress
the
authority
to
protect
navigable
waters,
from
pollution
for
example.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
it
affect
only
people
in
indiana
and
not
people
in
illinois,
so
that
illinois
doesn't
care
about
it?
i
mean,
is
this
a
real
problem?
if
it's
a
national
problem,
are
these
mosquitos
just
going
to
bite
indianans
and
not
people
from
illinois,
so
that
illinois
would
have
as
much
interest
in
preventing
that
as
the
federal
government?
you
would
think
they
would
have
more
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
may
i
suggest
why
it
could
have
some
independent
significance?
now,
congress
has
many
authorities
under
the
commerce
clause.
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
this
statute
was
appealing
to
one
aspect
of
congress'
commerce
clause
powers,
that
aspect
which
has
to
do
with
the
control
of
navigable
waters.
and
to
leap
from
that
and
simply
ignore
the
navigable
waters
appeal
and
just
say
all
congress
is
doing
is
exerting
its
broad
commerce
power
in
all
its
aspects
simply...
just
seems
to
me
to
ignore
a
very
precise
appeal
to
one
aspect
of
the
commerce
clause
power.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
but
congress
was
limiting
its
control
over
that
problem
to
navigable
waters,
and
even
the
definition
which
means
waters
of
the
united
states,
that
can
be
explained
without
making
the
word
navigable
totally
useless
in
the
statute,
by
simply
saying
that
was
meant
to
make
it
clear
that
when
congress
said
navigable
waters,
it
meant
the
broad
definition
of
navigability,
which
had
been
apparent
in
our
cases,
so
that
it
includes
wetlands
adjacent
to
navigable
waters
and
includes
even
tributaries
that
go
into
navigable
waters.
but
it
seems
to
me
to
blink
reality
and
to
say
that
congress
was
relying
upon
a
general
commerce
clause
power,
which
is
what
the
government's
position
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
it
didn't
say,
mr.
wallace,
is
what,
for
example,
16
usc
section
817
says,
a
different
statute.
that
imposes
requirements
on
water
projects
on,
quote,
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
and
other
waters,
quote,
over
which
congress
has
jurisdiction
under
its
authority
to
regulate
commerce.
now,
you're
essentially
saying
that's
what
this
statute
says.
but
if
it
says
it,
it
says
it
in
such
a
roundabout
way.
i
mean,
this
is
a
very
easy
way
to
say
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
water
projects
are
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
and
other
waters
over
which
congress
has
jurisdiction
under
its
authority
to
regulate
commerce.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wallace,
it's
at
least
unclear
enough
that
the
corps
of
engineers
didn't
come
to
this
interpretation
until
quite
late
on.
they
didn't
interpret
it
this
way
originally
themselves,
did
they?
that's
how
at
least
unclear
it
is,
not
to
say
clear
in
the
other
direction.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
statute
can
mean
one
thing
if
it's
prosecuted
criminally,
and
something
different
if
it's
prosecuted
civilly?
that's
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
what
the
footnote
you
appeal
to
would
seem
to
suggest.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
even
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
raises
the
different
problem
of
what
the
statute
means
depends
upon
whether
the
first
case
prosecuted
is
a
criminal
or
a
civil
case,
is
that
the
government's
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
that's
his
position.
i
think
his
position
is
not
that
the
commerce
power
doesn't
allow
you
to
protect
them.
it's
that
the
navigable
waters
aspect
of
the
commerce
power
doesn't
allow
you
to
protect
them,
and
if
congress
wants
to
come
back
and
exert
its
commerce
power
generally,
it
would
be
a
different
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
the
federal
government
was
content
to
protect
the
navigable
waters
from
pollution
and
to
leave
the
problem
of
the
pollution
of
waters
that
don't
affect
the
navigable
waters
to
the
states.
it's
a
perfectly
rational
approach.
