--and
presumably,
states
can
regulate,
under
your
theory,
these
isolated
waters
that
don't
flow
into
navigable
waters.
it's
within
the
states'
jurisdiction.
justice
sandra

what
about
lakes
or
ponds,
intrastate,
that
don't
flow
into
navigable
waters
but
which
can
support
rowboats
or
small
sailboats
or
something
like
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
are
you
asking
us,
counsel,
to
just
focus
on
the
bird
habitat
final
rule
or
to
focus
on
the
regulation
in
33
code
of
federal
regulations,
section
3328.3,
defining
waters
of
the
united
states?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
the
one
3328.3,
the
one
defining
waters
of
the
united
states?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
want
us
to
focus
on
that
and
in
your
view
it
is
too
broad
and
covers
things
the
statute
didn't
authorize?
justice
sandra

isolated,
intrastate
pond?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
the
bird
habitat
regulation
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it,
or
it
does?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
wallace,
this
comes
to
us
as
a
sort
of
as
applied
challenge,
i
guess,
and
in
the
context
of
provisions
imposing
criminal
penalties.
does
that
influence
our
interpretation
at
all?
is
there
any
rule
of
lenity
concerns
or
anything
of
the
sort
because
we
are
dealing
with
statutes
imposing
criminal
penalty?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
see
how
that
should
affect
our
determination.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
illinois
showed
no
interest
at
all
or
concern
about
this
particular
site?
is
this
a
situation
where
the
state
has
just
turned
its
back
and
said,
we
don't
care?
