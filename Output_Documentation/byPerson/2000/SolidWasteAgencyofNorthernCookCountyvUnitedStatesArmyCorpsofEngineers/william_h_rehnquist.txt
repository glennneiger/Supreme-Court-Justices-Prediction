of

mr.

rehnquist
mr.
bishop,
is
your
position
on
this
issue
influenced
in
any
respect
by
our
decision
in
riverside
versus
bayview
homes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
the
pesticide
is
shipped
in
interstate
commerce,
they
could
regulate
it
on
that
basis?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
bishop.
mr.
wallace,
we
will
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
understand
exactly
what
that
means,
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying
there
are
a
lot
of
laws
like
this
one?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
in
the
statute,
mr.
wallace?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
give
us...
is
it
in
your
brief
somewhere?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
tell
us
where?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
bishop,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bishop.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
two
cases.
the
first
is
99-1178,
solid
waste
agency
of
northern
cook
county
versus
the
untied
states
army
corps
of
engineers.
here
the
solid
waste
agency
purchased
an
abandoned
sand
and
gravel
pit
of
the
disposal
of
its
baled
non-hazardous
waste.
the
balefill
project
called
for
some
of
the
sites
permanent
and
seasonal
ponds
to
be
filled.
under
a
section
of
the
clean
water
act,
passed
by
congress,
the
army
corps
of
engineers
has
regulatory
authority
over
the
discharge
of
fill
material
into
navigable
waters.
the
corps
has
interpreted
this
language
to
include
discharge
into
non-navigable,
isolated,
intrastate
waters
observed
as
a
habitat
for
migratory
birds.
the
corps
found
that
the
ponds
of
the
old
mining
site
fell
under
this
so-called
migratory
bird
rule
and
refused
to
issue
a
discharge
permit.
the
solid
waste
agency
filed
suit
arguing
that
the
corps
has
exceeded
its
statutory
authority
in
interpreting
clean
water
act.
the
district
court
rejected
its
argument
and
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
it
held
that
the
clean
water
act
reached
as
many
waters
as
the
commerce
clause
allowed,
and
that
the
destruction
of
habitat
for
migratory
birds
substantially
affects
interstate
commerce.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse.
the
clean
water
act
defines
navigable
waters
as
waters
of
the
united
states,
although
we
have
previously
held
that
the
act
extends
the
wetlands
actually
abutting
on
a
navigable
waterway.
we
have
never
held
that
it
extends
to
isolated
ponds
that
have
no
significant
nexus
to
navigable
waters.
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statue
precludes
us
from
doing
so
now.
congress
intended
the
term
navigable
to
have
at
least
some
import,
and
the
corps’
position
would
require
to
read
it
out
of
the
statute
completely.
nonetheless,
the
corps
submits
that
the
amendments
of
the
clean
water
act
in
1977
demonstrate
congress’
awareness
of
and
acquiescence
to
the
migratory
bird
rule,
but
this
subsequent
legislative
history
does
not
convinced
us
that
congress
intended
to
displace
the
original
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
corps
also
contends
that
the
bird
rule
is
reasonable
and
should
it
be
afforded
deference,
but
warrant
administrative
interpretation
of
the
statute
invokes
the
outer
limits
of
congress’
power
under
the
commerce
clause.
we
expect
a
clear
indication
that
congress
intended
that
result.
the
exertion
of
federal
authority
under
the
migratory
bird
rule
raises
significant
constitutional
questions.
yet
there
is
nothing
approaching
a
clear
statement
from
congress
that
it
intended
to
regulate
isolated,
intrastate
ponds.
we
therefore
hold
the
corps
exceeded
its
authority
under
section
404
of
the
clean
water
act
in
asserting
jurisdiction
over
the
solid
waste
agency’s
side.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
souter,
ginsburg,
and
breyer
join.
