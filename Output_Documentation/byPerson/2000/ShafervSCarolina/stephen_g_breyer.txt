justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
the
prosecutor
argued
that
the
victim,
or
somebody
in
the
store
had
kept
saying,
they
might
come
back,
they
might
come
back,
and
then
he
tells
the
jury,
remember,
remember,
they
might
come
back,
they
might
come
back,
and
he
presented
quite
a
lot
of
evidence
that
this
person
had
committed
other
crimes,
and
that
he'd
even
committed
crimes
when
he
was
in
custody,
and
that
he
didn't
show
any
remorse.
i
mean,
what's
that
telling
the
jury?
it
sounds
the
jury
might
conclude
from
that
that
what
he's
worried
about
is
they
might
come
back,
including
this
man.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
we
wouldn't
care
if
they
came
back
if
they
weren't
going
to
be
dangerous
when
they
got
back,
would
we?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
addressing--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
addressing
your
point
about
the
argument,
and
you
just
said
that
what
they
were
concerned,
what
the
prosecutor
was
concerned
with
was
that
other
persons,
other
than
this
defendant
might
come
into
the
county.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
my
suggestion
is
that
i
don't
suppose
that
would
have
been
relevant
unless
those
persons,
when
they
came
into
the
county,
would
be
dangerous,
and
if
that's
true,
it
sounds
like
a
future
dangerousness
argument
that
would
apply
not
only
to
those
other
people,
but
to
this
person.
isn't
that
so?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
know
it
wasn't
phrased
like
that.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
that's
the
only
reasonable
tendency
of
the
argument.
how
else
would
it
have
been
taken?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
did
he
say...
what
is
really
etched
in
my
mind,
what
is
really
etched
in
my
mind
is
monica
picking
up
the
phone
and
saying,
hurry
up,
they
might
come
back,
they
might
come
back.
i
just
wondered
why
he
said
that.
it
was...
just
happened
to
be
a
circumstance
of--
