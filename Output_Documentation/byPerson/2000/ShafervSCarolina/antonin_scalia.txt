justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
to
be
future
dangerousness
to
the
general
public.
i
mean,
one
assumes
that
any
brutal
murderer
is
going
to
be
dangerous
in
the
prison
setting.
as
i
understand
simmons,
the
only
reason
it's
relevant
to
the
jury
to
know
whether
this
person
will
be
paroled
or
not
is
because
the
jury
is
worried
that
he
will
be
a
danger
to
the
general
public.
he'll
be
a
danger
to
other
inmates
in
the
prison
whether
he's
going
to
be
paroled
or
not,
so
don't
you
have
to
establish
that
what
has
been
argued
is
future
dangerousness
to
the
general
public?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
saying
that
a
prosecutor
cannot
argue
that,
you
know,
the
death
penalty
is
the
only
adequate
remedy
here
because
this
person
is
a
brutal
murderer.
he
has
killed
before
in
prison.
there
is
no
assurance
that
if
we
just
put
him
into
prison
he
will
not
kill
again
in
prison--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
you're
saying
if
the
prosecutor
makes
that
argument,
simmons
is
triggered,
because
obviously
if
he's
going
to
be
dangerous
in
prison
he's
going
to
be
dangerous
out
of
prison,
although
the
prosecutor
does
not
make
that
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
saying
you
can't
say
he's
going
to
be
dangerous
in
prison?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
said
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
argument
proves
too
much.
i
mean,
it
just
washes
the
simmons
requirement
that
you
have
argued
future
dangerousness
out.
i
mean,
suppose
the
prosecution
just
shows
during
the
course
of
the
trial...
he
never
argues
dangerousness,
but
he
shows
this
is
a
person
with
a
mean,
nasty
temper,
uncontrollable,
many
instances
of
killing
many,
many
people.
you
could
make
the
same
argument
you're
making
now,
it's
obvious
to
the
jury
that
this
person's
going
to
be
dangerous
if
we
let
him
out
again,
and
therefore
a
simmons
instruction
has
to
be
given.
i
don't
think
that
that's
what
we
said
in
simmons.
i
think
in
simmons
we
required
that
dangerousness
be
argued.
if
it's
not
argued,
then,
then--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
dissented,
of
course,
so
i
do
think
it
stands
for
a
strange
proposition,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
that
statute
can
be
amended,
i
presume,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
really
tell
the
jury
he
will
never
get
out
of
jail.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
isn't
the
law
that
must
guide
the
jury.
that
law
isn't
directed
to
the
jury.
it's
directed
to
prison
authorities,
and
if
the
jury
really
wants
to
know
whether
this
person
is
going
to
be
a
danger
to
the
general
public,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
advise
them
of
that.
you
know,
right
now
that's
how
the
statute
reads,
but
there's
a
great
anti
capital
punishment
movement
abroad
now,
and
many
people
think
we've
been
too
harsh,
it
may
be
amended.
what's
wrong
with
that
if
you
want
the
jury
to
know
the
real
state
of
affairs?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
i
understand
your
argument
correctly
that
you
think
simmons
would
apply
even
if
there
was
no
argumentation
about
future
dangerousness
so
long
as
the
jury
posed
the
question,
came
in
to
the
judge
and
said,
you
know,
will
he
get...
does
life
in
prison
mean
life
in
prison.
as
i
understood
what
you
said
a
little
bit
earlier,
you
think
that
that
alone
would
trigger
simmons,
no
argumentation
about
future
dangerousness
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
always
evidence
that
a
guy's
dangerous.
he's
killed
somebody.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
normal
murder
cases
that
aren't
these
family
murder
cases,
you
think
if
the
jury
asks,
you're
entitled
to
a
simmons
instruction.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
simmons
said
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
a
different
problem.
that's
not
the
problem
you're
complaining
about
here.
i
mean,
that
may
well
be
a
violation
not
to
let
counsel
argue
it.
whether
a
state
has
to
let
counsel
argue
it
is
quite
a
different
question
from
whether
a
state
must
require
the
judge
to
instruct
the
jury
concerning
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
that
part
of
your
assignment
of
error,
that
counsel
was
not
allowed
to
read
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
might
well
have
been
a
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
he
repeated
that
in
argument,
didn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
zelenka--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
other
state...
do
you
know
if
any
other
states
are
relying
upon
our
language
in
simmons
that
said
that
future
dangerousness
had
to
be
argued?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
suppose
we
changed
that
in
this
case
and
just
said,
oh,
foo,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
argued
or
not,
what
state
would
have
their
judgments
of
conviction
and
death
penalty
overturned?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
that
a
state
could
game
the
system,
couldn't
it,
by
providing
for
parole
eligibility
even
when
there
is
a
life
imprisonment
sentence
but
appointing
a
parole
commission
that
is
so
tough
that
it
never
gives
parole.
then
the
jury
would
be
instructed
that
unless
you
condemn
this
person
to
death,
there's
a
possibility
that
he'll
be
paroled,
although
in
fact
the
possibility's
not
very
realistic.
