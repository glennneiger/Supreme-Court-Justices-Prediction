justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
tell
me...
i
don't
want
to
take
you
too
far
away
from
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
states
that
do
apply
simmons
almost
as
a
matter
of
course,
do
many
of
those
refrain
from
giving
this
instruction
of
future
dangerousness
if
it's
not
argued?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
opponent
tells
us
that
south
carolina
and
pennsylvania
are
the
only
two
states
who
are
sort
of
the
rear
guard
against
giving
the
simmons
instruction.
just
so
you
have
a
fair
opportunity,
would
you
tell
what
is
the
state's
interest
that's
really
served
by
refusing
to
give
the
instruction
that
most
states
seem
to
think
pretty
ordinary?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
that's
the
case
it
would
be
just
harmless
to
give
me...
it
would
be
harmless
to
give
them
the
additional
sentence,
if
your
reading
is
correct.
why
not
read
the
other
sentence
and
remove
any
doubt?
