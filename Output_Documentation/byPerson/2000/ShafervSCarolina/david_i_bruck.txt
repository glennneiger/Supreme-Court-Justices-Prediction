mr.
david
i.
bruck
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
in
this
case
the
state
of
south
carolina
raises
three
arguments
designed
to
evade
this
court's
prior
decision
in
simmons
v.
south
carolina.
first,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
cited
a...
an
extraneous
feature
of
a
post
simmons
amendment
which,
the
main
thrust
of
which
was
to
abolish
parole
in
all
cases
of
murder,
to
hold
that
simmons
v.
south
carolina
does
not
apply
to
south
carolina.
secondly,
the
state
argues
that
even
though
simmons
recognized
a
due
process
right
to
inform
the
jury
that
the
defendant
was
ineligible
for
parole,
arguments
of
counsel
and
instructions
of
the
court
that
never
did
that
nevertheless
somehow
satisfy
the
due
process
requirements
of
simmons
in
any
event,
and
finally
the
state
argues,
seizing
on
a
single
word
culled
from
the
opinions
in
simmons,
the
word
argue,
submits
that
because
counsel
rather
self
evidently,
out
of
a
desire
to
evade
and
avoid
the
due
process
rule
in
simmons,
declined
to
drive
home
in
jury
argument
their
future
dangerousness
case
as
it
had
been
presented
to
the
jury,
therefore
the
rule
in
simmons
was
not
triggered.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
no.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
no,
it
didn't.
i
should
note
that--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--yes.
the
trial
judge--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--focused
entirely
on
this
word
argue
which,
of
course,
came
from
simmons,
because
simmons
was
a
case
where
the
state
presented
no
evidence
in
the
penalty
phase,
no
new
evidence
in
aggravation,
except,
i
think,
for
the
indictments
about
simmons'
prior
record,
but
all
the
facts
of
his
prior
conduct
had
come
in
in
the
guilt
phase,
and
what
the
court
did
in
simmons
was
present
a
veiled
metaphorical
argument
which
a
majority
of
the
court
found
to
raise
the
issue
rather
indirectly.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
excuse
me.
the
prosecutor.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
the
prosecutor
presented
a
veiled
metaphorical
argument
that
the
majority
of
this
court
found
raised
the
specter
of
future
dangerousness
in
the
simmons
case,
and
therefore
on
occasion
members
of
this
court
in
the
various
opinions
in
simmons
referred
to
the
rule
in
simmons
as
one
involving
a
triggered
by
argument
relative
to
future
dangerousness.
however,
at
other
points
in
the
opinions
the
court
also
used
terms
such
as,
where
the
prosecution
seeks
to
demonstrate.
i
think
that
was
the
formulation
in--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--yes.
in
formulating--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--because
of
the
fact
that
at
other
points
in
justice
o'connor's
same
opinion
she
used
the
term,
show
future
dangerousness,
where
the
state
seeks
to
show
that
the
defendant
would
be
dangerous
in
the
future.
it--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
that's
correct,
and
here
i
think
the
state
court
is
simply
confused
about
what
simmons
required.
the
south
carolina
procedure
is
that
the...
a
jury
is
instructed
to
determine
first
whether
any
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
is
shown.
this
is
a
georgia
type
nonweighing
statute
in
which
the
finding
of
an
aggravator
is
a
threshold
finding.
the
jury
is
instructed,
pursuant
to
the
statute,
and
this
jury
was
instructed
that
if
the
jury
does
not
unanimously
find
the
existence
of
a
statutory
aggravating
factor,
it
goes
no
further.
it
does
not
sentence.
it
simply
reports
its
failure
to
find
the
aggravator
to
the
judge,
and
the
judge
sentences,
and
at
that
point
the
judge
has
the
option,
and
only
under
those
circumstances
the
judge
has
the
option
of
either
imposing
a
30-calendar-year
sentence
or
life,
of
course
without
the
possibility
of
parole.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
they
were
not
instructed
about
the
30-year
option
because
it's
none
of
their
concern.
they
were
simply
told--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--well,
that's
correct,
because
that's
all
the
jury
needs
to
know.
that's
the
jury's
job.
once
the
jury
finds
an
aggravating
factor,
then
and
only
then
the
jury
becomes
the
sentencer.
prior
to
that
time,
they
don't
need
to
know
about
parole.
they
don't
need
to
know
about
aggravation,
mitigation.
they
don't
need
to
know
anything.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
that's...
if
they
have
them,
that's
exactly
correct,
and
so
the
judge
correctly
told
the
jury,
if
you
find
aggravation,
then
you
become
the
sentencer,
and
there
are
only
two
alternatives,
the
death
penalty
or
life
imprisonment.
this
is
exactly
the
situation
in
simmons.
it
cannot
be
distinguished.
the
only
difference
is
that
the...
if
the
jury
never
acquires
sentencing
responsibility
in
the
first
place,
there
is
another
option.
there's
no
reason
why
the
jury
should
know
about
that.
it's
not
part
of
their
job.
it's
not
part
of
their
responsibility.
the
state
supreme
court
just
yesterday
filed
another
case
which
my
friend
helpfully
filed,
lodged
with
the
court
yesterday,
state
v.
kelly,
in
which
the
court
finally
explained
its
rationale...
this
is
the
state
supreme
court...
for
this
holding.
it
said
in
kelly
that
where
another
sentence
other
than
life
without
parole
was
available
to
the
defendant
as
an
alternative
to
the
death
penalty...
this
is
at
page
11
of
the
slip
opinion...
then
a
simmons
charge
would
actually
mislead
the
jury
by
representing
that
the
defendant
would
never
be
released
from
prison,
when,
in
fact,
a
30-year
sentence
is
a
potential
sentence
for
the
defendant.
now,
it's
clear
what
has
happened.
this
explanation
doesn't
appear
in
the
shafer
case
or
in
the
accompanying
starnes
case,
but
now
apparently
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
is
laboring
under
the
misconception
that
a
simmons
instruction
is
a
prediction
to
the
jury
as
to
the
defendant's
fate,
rather
than
an
explanation
of
the
sentencing
option
of
life
imprisonment
that
the
jury
is
given.
of
course,
the
simmons
instruction
is
the
latter.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
prediction
about
what
is
going
to
happen
to
the
defendant
as
of
this
moment,
when
the
jury
hasn't
yet
found
aggravation.
in
any
event,
none
of
this
really
matters.
the...
it's
quite
clear,
i
think,
that
justice
kennedy's
plurality
opinion
in
ramdass,
which
we
quoted
in
our
brief
and,
indeed,
in
the
question
presented
in
the
cert
petition,
three
times
stated
the
holding
of
simmons
in
a
way
that
precisely
encompasses
this
case.
he
said,
the
parole
eligibility
instruction
is...
of
simmons
is
required
only
when,
assuming
the
jury
fixes
the
sentence
at
life,
the
defendant
is
ineligible
for
parole
under
state
law.
simmons
applies
elsewhere
in
the
opinion
only
to
instances
where,
as
a
legal
matter,
there
is
no
possibility
of
parole
if
the
jury
decides
the
appropriate
sentence
is
life
imprisonment,
and
i
can
go
on.
that
is
the
holding
of
simmons.
that
is
the
holding
which
was
clearly
violated
in
this
case
and
which,
according
to
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
no
longer
applies
in
south
carolina.
now,
clearly
a
mistake
has
been
made
and
we
submit
that
it
should
be
corrected.
this
leaves
the
question
of
what
to
do
with
this
case.
the
state
asks
you
to
remand
the
case
back
to
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
to
perform
the
rest
of
the
simmons
analysis.
we
submit
that
the
case
has
been
fully
briefed
and
fully
argued
as
to
every
aspect
of
simmons
below.
surely
if
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
thought
that
future
dangerousness
had
not
been
placed
in
issue
in
this
case,
they
would
not
have
gone
to
such
a
constitutionally
tenuous
attempt
to
reconsider
the
first--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--yes,
before
kelly
i
would
have
said
that
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
required
the
word
dangerousness
to
actually
be
used
in
jury
argument.
in
kelly
they
actually
used
the
word
dangerousness,
and
apparently
that's
still
not
enough,
so
i
was
coming
around
to
saying
that
while
i
had
thought
that
south
carolina
did
not
accept
the
state's
argument
on
the
dangerousness
prong
of
simmons,
kelly
does
cast
that
into
some
light.
certainly,
this
whole
little
saga
leaves
us
with
the...
i
think
should
leave
the
court
with
some
confidence
that
it's
time
to
decide
this
case,
the
whole
aspect
of
it.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
as
a
lawyer
who
tries
these
cases
in
the
trial
court
i
think
there
is
considerable
merit
to
that
view,
but
i
don't
endorse
it
or
embrace
it
on
behalf
of
my
client,
because
there's
no
need
to.
the
rule
in
simmons
is
workable
and
is
certainly
more
than
enough
to
warrant
relief
in
this
case.
when--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--i
stand
corrected.
that
is
what
they
ask.
now,
it
is
possible
to
imagine
cases
which
do
not
raise
future
dangerousness.
we
should
keep
in
mind,
though,
the
nature
of
the
south
carolina
statute,
in
which
it
is
especially
difficult,
i
agree,
to
draw
a
line.
this
is
a
very
open
ended
statute,
in
which
there
is
no
limitation
on
the
nonstatutory
evidence
that
the
jury
may
consider
as
weighing
on
the
death
side
of
the
question.
once
a
statutory
aggravator
is
found,
in
this
case
the
entire
penalty
phase
showing
by
the
state
consists
of
wesley
shafer's
prior
convictions
for
criminal
sexual
conduct
and
burglary,
his
failure
as
a,
quote,
high
risk
probationer,
who
is
incapable
of
rehabilitation,
according
to
the
state's
claims
and
evidence,
who
is
prone
to
angry
outbursts
of
explosive
behavior
even
in
the
highly
restrictive
confines
of
the
union
county
jail,
and
who
exhibits
lack
of
remorse
and
lack
of
insight
about
his
prior
behavior.
now,
this
is
a
classic
showing
of
future
dangerousness.
this
is
exactly
why--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--yes,
but
the
fact
that
a
person
is
dangerous
in
prison
is
ipso
facto
evidence
that
if
the
bars
are
removed,
and
the
jail
door
is
opened,
and
he's
allowed
to
go
into
the
far
less
protected
and
restrictive
environment
of
society...
i
mean,
it
would
be
farcical
to
argue,
well,
this
person
will
be
dangerous
in
prison,
but
if
you
let
him
out
there's
no
reason
to
think
he
won't
do
just
fine.
the
state
supreme
court,
i
submit,
has
become,
with
all
due
respect,
confused
on
this
issue
as
well
and
in
the--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--certainly--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--yes,
and--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--he
can
say
it,
but
the
defense
is
entitled
to
simmons
instruction,
and
seven
members
of
this
court
joined
opinions
which
said
that
in
simmons.
the--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--which
said
that
the...
that
when
a
simmons
instruction
is
given,
of
course
the
state
may
still
show...
justice
o'connor's
plurality
opinion
made
this
point,
as
did
the...
justice
o'connor's
concurrence,
as
did
the
plurality
opinion.
the
state
may
still
show
that
he
will
nevertheless
be
dangerous
in
prison,
but
everything
must
come
out.
there
is
no
warrant
whatsoever
for
saying
that
someone
is
so
dangerous
that
he
will
kill
again
in
prison
and
yet
pretend
as
though
the
jury
is
not
going
to
draw
the
inevitable
common
sense
conclusion
that
if
he's
that
dangerous
in
prison,
with
concrete
and
bars
all
around
him,
he
will
also
be
dangerous
if
he's
released
on
parole,
and
if
there's
any
doubt--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--that
is
exactly
my
point,
that
the
fact
that
even
under
all
this
supervision
he
is
explosively
angry,
and
the
jailer
has
to
slam
the
door,
the
cell
door
to
constrain
his
rage
when
his...
the
telephone
is
cut
off--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--well,
if
that
had
been
the
holding
of
simmons,
then
simmons
would
stand
for
the
very
strange
proposition
that
the
state
is
entitled
to
prove
future
dangerousness,
to
call
witness
after
witness,
and
indeed
that's
what
they
did
here,
and
the
state's
own
pretrial
notice
described
this
evidence
as
evidence
of
future
dangerousness.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
that's
okay.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
no.
in
fact,
this
is
an
argument
which
has
almost
run
its
course
in
the
entire
nation.
by
our
count
there
are
37
states
that
have
a
policy,
statute,
rule
or
court
decision
on
this
issue.
35
of
them
tell
the
jury
the
law
about
parole
release,
which
in
most
cases
is
no
parole
release.
the
only
states
in
which
simmons
has
any
application
at
all,
and
i
include
south
carolina
here,
although
the
state
supreme
court
says
it
has
almost
none,
are
pennsylvania
and
south
carolina,
and
pennsylvania,
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
is
divided
4
to
3
on
whether
to
give
a
simmons
instruction
in
every
case,
and
there
is
an
arguable
distinction
in
pennsylvania
that
does
not
apply
in
south
carolina,
a
way
of
distinguishing
the
two
states,
which
is
that
in
pennsylvania
aggravation
is
limited.
this
court
knows
the
statute
from
blystone
v.
pennsylvania.
only
designated
statutory
aggravating
factors
may
be
considered
as
reasons
to
impose
the
death
penalty,
and
future
dangerousness
is
not
one
of
them,
so
in
theory
there
is
nowhere
for
the
jury
to
give
aggravating
weight
to
the
likely
dangerous
behavior
of
the
defendant.
nevertheless,
when
the
argument
is
made,
the
state
supreme
court
has
required
that
a
simmons
instruction
be
given.
that
is
the
entire
roster
of
states
that
don't
just
tell
the
jury
what's
going
to
happen
if
they
spare
this
man's
life,
so
as
i
say,
this
is
an
issue,
a
debate
which
is
really
to
all
intents
and
purposes
virtually
over,
except
in
south
carolina.
now,
part
of...
i
think
part
of
the
proof
that...
and
it
does
not
depend
on
the
jury's
questions,
but
the
jury's
questions
really
remind
us
that
we
really
have
encountered
a
pretty
serious
problem
here.
the
jury,
why
did
they
ask?
why
would
they
have
asked
about
parole,
if
not
for
the
fact,
having
found
an
aggravating
circumstance
and
turned
to
their
sentencing
responsibility,
they
were
worried
about
whether
he
was
going
to
get
out
or
not
because
he
was
dangerous.
parole
is
relevant
because
of
future
dangerousness,
and
that
is
probably
what
was
happening.
the
prosecutor's
evidence,
his
case
of
dangerousness,
did
resonate
with
this
jury,
which
is
entirely
to
be
expected.
as
i
was
getting
ready
to
say,
if...
if
an
actual
formal
argument
or
statutory
allegation
were
required
to
trigger
the
rule
in
simmons,
then
it
would
be
entirely
all
right
for
the
prosecution
to
do
everything
they
could
through
evidence--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--no.
no.
we
are
one
of
only
two
states
in
which
the
governor
has
only
clemency
power
over
the
death
sentence.
he
cannot
reduce...
this
is
as
airtight
a
system
as
the
mind
of
man
can
devise.
life
without
parole
in
south
carolina
means
just
that.
there
is
a
statutory
provision
which
by
its
terms
requires
the
most
extraordinary
circumstances.
in
simmons,
this
court
noted--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--yes,
of
course.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
but
that's
not
the
instruction
we
asked
for.
the
instruction
we
asked
for
was
the
statutory
language
about
parole.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
yes.
you
so
decided
in
california
v.
ramos.
that's--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--no.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
it
never
has
been
passed
on,
but
that
is
a...
that
is
a
peculiar
problem,
because
to
argue
that
the
law
that
must
guide
the
jury
is
like
ice,
it's
likely
to
melt
next
summer
and
can
effervesce
away,
leaves
the
jury
with
a
rather
brutal
fact
that
only
death
is
permanent.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
you
know,
the
general
proposition
is
that
states
enjoy
broad
discretion
under
california
v.
ramos
to
tell
all
sorts
of
things
like
this
to
the
jury,
and
my
case
does
not
depend
on
the
exact
outer
limitation
of
that.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
and--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--of
course
he
could.
of
course.
simmons
is
an
argument
about
rebuttal.
it
is
an
argument...
we
don't
allege
prosecutorial
misconduct.
we
just
allege
the
right
to
tell
our
side
of
the
story,
and
let
the
prosecutor
tell
their
side.
they've
got
to
tell
theirs,
and
we
didn't
get
the
most
important
fact
before
the
jury,
which
is
that
19-year-old
wesley
shafer
is--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--if
there
was
neither
argumentation
nor
evidence
presented
by
the
state--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--well,
there
really
isn't.
you
know,
the
capital
case
tried
before
this
one,
in
this
very
courtroom
in
union
county,
south
carolina
was
the
case
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
v.
susan
smith.
now,
that
is
a
paradigmatic
example
of
a
case
in
which
future
dangerousness
was
not
at
issue.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
and
drowned
her
children,
right.
now,
there
are
rare
cases,
but
family
murders,
for
example,
situational
murders
like
that,
where
the
circumstances
are
certain
never
to
recur,
do
not
implicate
future
dangerousness.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
if
there
is--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--no.
i
think
that
either...
no,
i
don't
think
it's
the
jury's
question.
i
think
that
is
the
question
for
another
day.
i
think
a
good
argument
could
be
made
that
you
are
entitled
to
it,
but
it
is
not
an
argument
that
we
need
to
make,
because
the
reason,
in
this
case,
the
jury
probably
asked
is
that
the
state
proved
future
dangerousness,
or
at
least
took
a
pretty
good
run
at
it,
as
they
said
they
were
going
to
do
in
their
pretrial
notice.
they
were
good
to
their
word.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
no,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
counsel
requested
the
right
to
read
that
statute
to
the
jury.
the
state
opposed
the
argument,
and
the
judge
ordered
him
not
to
do
it,
and
as
a
result,
all
he
was
left
with
was
various
metaphors
for
the
term,
life
imprisonment,
which
by
its
terms...
i
mean,
if
you
analyze
it
closely--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--no,
you
don't,
but
in
the
course
of
argument
about
the
statute,
the...
about
the
jury
instructions,
defense
counsel
i
think
very
properly,
when
the
court
indicated
he
wouldn't
give
the
charge,
counsel
said,
well,
i
would
at
least
like
to
read
to
the
jury,
which
of
course
simmons
says
is
another
way
to
take
care
of
this
problem,
this
statute,
and
the
prosecution
said
no,
that
will
educate
the
jury
about
parole
and
you
can't
do
that
either,
and
the
judge
sustained
the
state's
position,
so
he
said
nothing
about
parole,
and
the
jury
clearly
noticed
the
omission.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
well,
in
this
court...
in
this
case,
seven
members
of
this
court
said
that
it
was
all
encompassed
within
the
simmons
rule,
and
that's
the
way
it
was
addressed
in
this
case.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
no.
we
did
not
make
that
a--
mr.
david
i.
bruck
--a
separate
assignment
of
error.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
if
i
may,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
thank
you,
your
honor.
justice
o'connor
asked
whether
the
prosecutor
or
judges
had
the
power
to
give
this
instruction
whether
simmons
is
seen
to
require
it
or
not.
in
the
record
of
this
case
that
you
have
here,
there
is
an
excerpt
from
a
subsequent
case
tried
by
the
same
trial
judge,
judge
hayes,
state
v.
robertson,
which
was
added
to
this
record
in
the
lower
court,
in
which
the
same
argument
by
the
same
prosecutors
in
an
adjoining
county
was
made
in
which
judge
hayes
ruled
that
he
would
give
the
instruction
and
stated,
this
has
bothered
me
ever
since
the
shafer
case,
so
until
the
shafer
decision
from
the
state
supreme
court,
this
was
an
area
of
considerable
discretion
and,
in
fact,
most
prosecutors
didn't
make
an
issue
of
it
and
the
instruction
was
very
often
given.
but
now,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
has
made
quite
clear
that
except
in
very
rare
cases
involving
a
recidivist
statute
that's
almost
never
invoked,
the
life
without
parole
section
of
the
statute
will
never
be
given
unless
this
court
rules
otherwise
under
the
simmons
case.
the
last
thing
i
want
to
say
is
that
the
near
unanimity
of
the
states
on
this
issue
really
does
demonstrate,
i
think,
a
paradigmatic
example
of
a
due
process
violation,
where
the
considered
judgments
of
the
american
people
on
this
claim,
as
expressed
through
their
courts
and
legislatures,
is
already
quite,
quite
clear.
now,
i
had
thought
that
simmons
was
also
clear
as
to
what
the
due
process
clause
required,
but
clearly
in
south
carolina
it
is
not
clear
enough,
so
i
would
hope
that
this
court
will
decide
all
of
the
issues
that
are
presented
by
this
record
whether
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
reached
them
or
not.
i
think
there's
no
need
for
another
analysis
such
as
went
on
in
the
kelly
case.
mr.
david
i.
bruck
your
honor,
i
was
under
that
impression,
too,
and
i
was
just
looking
through
the
joint
appendix
right
now.
i
recall
mr.
banks,
defense
counsel,
saying
that
he
wanted
to
read
that
to
the
jury,
but
i
can't
put
my
finger
on
it
right
now.
if
i
may,
i
will
file
a
letter
with
the
clerk
giving
the
citation
if,
in
fact,
my
recollection
is
correct.
and
for
those
reasons
we
hope
that
the
court
will
take
up
all
of
the
issues
presented
by
this
case
and
will
reverse
the
death
sentence
imposed.
