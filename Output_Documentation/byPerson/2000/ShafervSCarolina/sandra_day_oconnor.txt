justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
now,
the
court
of
appeals
decision
here
did
not
really
reach
that
issue--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--of
whether
future
dangerousness
was
argued,
did
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
the
trial
judge
thought
that
the
prosecutor
had
not,
in
fact,
made
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--argument.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
even
if
we
thought
that
future
dangerousness
must
be
argued
or,
as
you
now
put
it,
shown,
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
didn't
reach
that
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
what
we
really
are
left
looking
at
here,
i
suppose,
is
whether
this
other
sentencing
option
that
the
trial
judge
would
have
if
the
jury
does
not
find
an
aggravating
circumstance
would
trigger
simmons.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
supreme
court,
as
i
read
the
opinion,
really
rested
its
holding
on
this
new
sentencing
option
for
the
trial
judge
of
30
years
in
the
event
the
jury
did
not
find
an
aggravating
factor.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
really
didn't
reach
the
question
of
whether
future
dangerousness
was
argued
or
presented.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
so
are
you
going
to
talk
about
the
ground
that
the
supreme
court
rested
on?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
you
do
that,
it
seemed
to
me
that
at
the
time
the
jury
was
instructed
and
given
an
instruction
about
what
it
could
do,
that
it
was
told
if
they
found
an
aggravating
circumstance,
then
its
options
were
life
imprisonment
or
death,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
jury
is
not
told
about
what
might
happen
by
sentencing
by
the
trial
judge
if
they
don't
find
an
aggravating
circumstance.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
would
think
that
simmons
would
apply
to
the
jury
instruction
at
that
stage,
assuming
future
dangerousness
is
in
the
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
option
was
not
available
to
the
jury.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
what
the
jury
was
told
its
function
was.
i
just
don't
understand
why
simmons
would
not
apply,
assuming
future
dangerousness
was
at
issue.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
that's
what
the
jury
had
to
decide.
if
it
found
an
aggravating
factor,
then
its
options
were
life
imprisonment
or
death,
and
the
jury
sent
around
questions
saying,
what
does
it
mean
if
it's
life
imprisonment.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
would
have
thought
that
simmons
would
be
triggered
there,
despite
the
fact
that
if
they
found
no
aggravating
circumstance,
then
something
else
would--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it
was
not
a
potential
the
jury
had
before
it.
i
just
don't
understand
this
argument
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what's
the
matter
with
telling
the
sentencer
what
the
statutory
scheme
is?
why
is
that
such
a
problem?
why
not
just
tell
them
what
the
statute
says?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
just
don't
understand
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
was
the
prosecutor's
decision.
i
mean,
if
the
prosecutor
had
given
the
instruction,
the
supreme
court
wasn't
going
to
somehow
revoke
it.
i
mean,
it
was
up
to
the
prosecutor,
wasn't
it,
whether
to
agree
to
allow
the
statute
to
be
read?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
the
prosecutor
said,
judge,
we're
perfectly
willing
to
have
the
statute
read,
that
would
be
okay,
wouldn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
you
check
the
record
and
tell
us
if
that's
the
case?
not
right
now,
you
have
no
time
left,
but
advise
us
subsequently?
