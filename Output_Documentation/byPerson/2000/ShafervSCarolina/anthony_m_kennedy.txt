justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
i
be
right
to
observe...
maybe
it's
not
right.
did
the
jury
know
in
this
case
about
this
third
option,
or
was
it
instructed
to
that
effect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
far
as
the
jury
knew,
it
was
determining
just
between
life
imprisonment,
however
they
might
define
that,
and
the
capital
punishment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
yesterday's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yesterday's
case...
is
it
williams
+/?
or
kelly,
the
kelly
case
does
indicate
that,
to
me
that
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
takes
a
very
formal
view
of
the
issue
of
future
dangerousness.
there
it
seems
to
me
that
the
argumentation
by
the
prosecution
was
really
much
more
geared
towards
future
dangerousness
even
than
yours,
and
even
in
that
case
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
thought
that
that
issue
had
not
been
submitted
to
the
jury
in
a
way
to
trigger
the
simmons
instruction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
those
cases,
let's
say
a
simmons
instruction
is
given,
can
the
prosecution
stand
up
and
say,
well
now,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
it's
true
that
there's
life
parole,
but
you
know,
these
legislatures
change
things,
and
10
years
from
now
this
defendant
may
get
out.
would
that
be
proper
argumentation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
has
that
ever
been
passed
on?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
want
us
to
interpret
the
concurring
opinion
in
simmons
as
a
formal
submission
of
an
aggravating
factor
of
future
dangerousness
as
the
basis
for
triggering
the
simmons
requirement.
there...
i
think
there's
other
language
in
the
concurring
opinion
that
goes
somewhat
further
than
that.
it
says
that
prosecutors
often
emphasize
the
defendant's
future
dangerousness
in
their
evidence
and
argumentation
at
the
sentencing
phase.
that's
not
a
formal...
of
future
dangerousness
in
the
sense
of
a
statutory
aggravating
factor.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand
that,
so
we're
talking
about
the
argumentation
that's
made
at
the
sentencing
phase.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
was
not
a
potential
the
jury
knew
anything
about.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
you're
right,
as
a
metaphysical
matter,
for
a
moment
in
time
this
was
like
ramdass.
there
were
more
than
two
options
open.
but
from
a
functional
standpoint,
the
jury
didn't
know
anything
about
it,
and
that's
what
simmons
is
directed
to.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
that
you
would
agree
that
if
there
were
a
trifurcation
here,
and
the
jury
first
found
that
there
was
an
aggravating
factor
and
then
came
back,
then
the
simmons
instruction
would
have
to
be
given
if
future
dangerousness
was
going
to
be--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--would
it
be
fair
for
me
to
infer
from
this
record
and
from
what
i
read
in
the
kelly
case
that's
just
been
submitted
that
prosecutors
in
your
state
sometimes
are
a
little
careful
about
arguing
future
dangerousness
so
that
the
simmons
instruction
will
not
be
triggered?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
a
tactical
decision.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
seems
to
me
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
that
seems
to
me
to
indicate
there's
a
very
strong
reason
for
simmons
instructions
to
be
given,
because
it
does
affect
what
the
jury's
going
to
do.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
was
just
three
lines,
three
or
four
sentences.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
they
weren't
read
the
one
or
two
sentences
that
strictly
follow
that
from
the
statute.
it
takes
30
seconds
to
read
it,
if
that.
