do
you
associate
yourself
with
the
position
that
was
taken
by
a
friend
on
your
side
that
inevitably,
in
any
capital
murder
case,
future
dangerousness
is
present
as
a
factor,
so
that
it
isn't
a
case
by
case
thing,
that
the
jury
in
every
case
is
determining
whether
it's
going
to
be
death
rather
than
life?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
couldn't
the
prosecutor
at
least
argue,
if
you're
going
to
make
your
argument,
at
least
argue
to
the
jury,
this
person
is
an
animal,
he
will
try
to
get
out...
bust
out
of
prison.
maybe
there
was
a
history
of
jail
break
by
this
person.
couldn't
the
prosecutor
bring
that
up?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
zelenka,
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
since
this
new
option
came
in
for
the
judge
alone,
not
for
the
jury,
in
capital
murder
trials
in
south
carolina,
on
how
many
occasions
has
the
jury
failed
to
find
an
aggravator
so
that
the
judge
would
be
sentencing
under
the
30-year
mandatory
minimum?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
there
been
any?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
how
long
has
it
been
in
force,
this
judge
option
of
30
years?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
there
would
have
been
some
time,
if--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i'm
not
clear
on
your
answer.
have
there
been
cases,
capital
murder
cases
where
the
jury
has
failed
to
find
the
aggravator--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
they
were
charged
they
could
find?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh,
a
guilty
plea,
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
could
have
come
about
as
a
guilty
plea?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
okay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--before
we
get
to
that,
could
a
defense
attorney
say,
judge,
i
want
you
to
bifurcate.
first
tell
the
jury,
come
and
say
whether
or
not
they
find
an
aggravator,
and
that
would
set
the
defense
up
to
get
the
simmons
charge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
it
been
asked
for
in
any
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
when
a
jury
asks...
i
mean,
obviously
this
jury
thought
that
was
ambiguous
because
they
asked
the
judge,
in
effect,
what
does
it
mean--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
the
judge
did
read
the
statute
up
to
that
point,
life
imprisonment
means
until
death
of
the
offender,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
just
didn't
go
on
with
the
rest
of
the
statute,
which
would
have
made
it
plain
what
that
meant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
when
the
judge
couples
that
with
a
statement,
now,
don't
you
worry
about
parole,
that's
none
of
your
business,
the
implication
is
that
there
is
such
a
thing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
is
not
the
case
that
the
defense
attorney
asked
if
he
could
read
the
rest
of
the
statute,
including,
starting
with
no
person
sentenced
to
life
in
prison
is
eligible
for
parole?
he
was
not...
he
wanted
to
read
that,
and
he
was
not
allowed
to.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
the
judge,
and
not
defense
counsel?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bruck,
do
you
know
the
answer
to
the
question
that
was
asked
about...
i
was
under
the
impression
that
defense
counsel
had
asked
to
be
allowed
to
say
this,
or
was
told
he
couldn't
say
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
capital
cases,
a
state
may
support
its
death
penalty
plea
by
suggesting
to
the
jury
that
the
defendant
will
pose
a
future
danger
to
society
unless
the
ultimate
punishment
is
imposed.
in
a
1994
decision,
simmons
against
south
carolina,
we
held
that
when
a
state
suggests
the
defendant’s
future
dangerousness,
if
the
jury
is
allowed
only
two
sentencing
choices,
death
or
life
imprison
without
the
possibility
of
parole,
due
process
requires
that
the
jurors
be
told
of
defendant’s
parole
ineligibility.
this
case
concerns
the
application
of
simmons
to
the
capital
sentencing
scheme,
effective
in
south
carolina
since
1996.
this
scheme
enforce
when
petitioner
wesley
aaron
shafer
was
tried
and
convicted
of
murder.
during
the
sentencing
phase
of
shafer’s
trial,
the
defense
maintained
and
the
prosecutor
denied
that
the
state
had
placed
shafer’s
future
dangerousness
at
issue.
the
trial
court
thought
the
question
closed
but
ruled
in
the
prosecution’s
favor.
the
judge
therefore
refused
to
tell
the
jury
that
a
life
sentence
carries
no
possibility
of
parole.
he
simply
instructed
that
life
imprisonment
means
until
the
death
of
the
defendant.
after
deliberating
for
some
hours,
the
jury
sought
further
instruction.
it
sent
a
note
to
the
judge
asking
‘is
there
any
remote
chance
for
someone
convicted
of
murder
to
become
eligible
for
parole’.
the
judge
replied,
‘parole
eligibility
or
ineligibility
is
not
for
your
consideration’.
about
an
hour
and
20
minutes
later,
the
jury
unanimously
recommended
the
death
penalty
which
the
judge
imposed.
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
affirmed
that
court
assumed
for
purposes
of
its
decision
that
the
prosecutor
have
in
fact
placed
shafer’s
future
dangerousness
at
issue.
nevertheless,
the
court
held
that
simmons
was
inapplicable
to
the
state’s
new
sentencing
scheme.
under
that
regime
the
court
explained,
when
a
capital
jury
begins
its
sentencing
deliberations,
three
sentencing
possibilities
exist:
death,
life
without
the
possibility
of
parole,
or
a
mandatory
minimum
30-year
sentence.
because
an
alternative
to
death,
other
than
life
without
parole,
figures
in
the
scheme,
the
court
concluded
that
simmons
no
longer
bears
on
south
carolina’s
capital
sentencing.
satisfied
that
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
read
our
simmons’
decision
incorrectly,
we
reverse.
the
south
carolina
supreme
court’s
reasoning
might
be
persuasive
if
the
sentencing
discretion
entrusted
to
the
jury
included
the
three
choices
the
court
identified,
but
it
does
not.
south
carolina
capital
jurors
are
charged
to
approach
their
sentencing
task
sequentially.
first,
they
decide
whether
the
state
has
proven
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt,
the
existence
of
any
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
set
out
in
the
sentencing
statute.
if
no
statutory
aggravator
is
found
unanimously,
the
jury’s
job
is
done.
the
judge
then
becomes
the
sentencer
and
may
impose
either
a
life
sentence
or
mandatory
minimum
30-year
prison
term.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
the
jury
finds
one
of
the
listed
aggravators,
it
then
faces
just
two
sentencing
choices:
death
or
a
life
imprisonment
without
the
possibility
of
parole.
no
other
sentencing
option
is
available
to
the
jury.
when
the
jurors
endeavor
the
moral
judgment
whether
to
impose
the
death
penalty,
parole
eligibility
or
the
absence
thereof,
may
become
critical
to
its
life
or
death
decision.
therefore,
simmons
holds
sway
at
that
stage
and
the
jury
must
be
told
that
the
defendant
is
ineligible
for
parole.
we
reject
south
carolina’s
alternative
argument
that
the
jury
was
adequately
informed
by
the
trial
court’s
instructions
and
by
defense
counsel’s
closing
argument
that
shafer
would
die
in
prison
if
sentenced
to
life.
eliminating
parole
availability
is
a
relatively
recent
development.
common
sense
indicates
that
many
jurors
might
not
know
whether
a
life
sentence
carries
with
it
the
possibility
of
parole.
the
jury’s
question
whether
someone
convicted
of
a
murder
could
be
eligible
for
parole
indicates
that
shafer’s
sentencers
failed
to
gain
from
counsel
or
court
a
clear
understanding
of
what
a
south
carolina
life
sentence
means.
south
carolina
supreme
court
did
not
take
up
the
question
whether
the
prosecutor’s
evidentiary
submissions
or
closing
arguments
in
fact
placed
shafer’s
future
dangerousness
at
issue.
that
matter
remains
open
for
consideration
on
remand.
justice
scalia
and
justice
thomas
have
each
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
