mr.
donald
john
zelenka
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
in
the
1994
decision
of
simmons
v.
south
carolina,
justice
o'connor
in
her
concurring
opinion
stated
that
when
the
state
puts
the
defendant's
future
dangerousness
in
issue
and
the
only
alternative
sentence
to
death
is
life
imprisonment
without
possibility
of
parole,
due
process
entitles
the
defendant
to
inform
the
capital
jury
by
either
argument
or
instruction
that
he
is
parole
ineligible.
for
three
separate
reasons,
we
submit
the
south
carolina
trial
judge
in
1998
did
not
violate
due
process
or
the
mandates
of
this
court
in
simmons
in
failing
to
specifically
instruct
the
jury
that
the
petitioner
was
parole
ineligible.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
we're
not
asserting,
and
south
carolina
does
not
have
a
formal
statutory
aggravating
factor
of
future
dangerousness.
it
allows
the
admission
of
evidence
concerning
the
defendant's
character
as
a
fact.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
that's
correct.
based
upon
argument
or
evidence,
the
issue
of
future
dangerousness
to
society
is
what
would
be
necessary
in
this
particular
case.
for
the
reasons
that
we've
set
forth
in
our
brief,
we
think
that
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
appropriately
followed
the
mandates
of
simmons
in
making
its
determinations
that
simmons
did
not
apply
because
there
was
at
the
time--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--that's
correct.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
it
did
not
appear
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
future
dangerousness--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--yes,
i
am,
and--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--that's
correct.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
they
were
not
told
in
this
situation.
they
were
told
if
they
did
not
find
an
aggravating
factor
they
should
stop.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
we
believe
that
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
correctly
decided
the
case
because
when
the
jury
instructions
were
given,
after
the
jury
arguments
were
made
there
was
another
option
that
was
available
for
sentencing,
and
that
option
was
a
30-year
sentence--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--because
the
question
as
to
whether
that
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
existed,
which
was
the
factor
which
would
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
the
30-year-without-parole
option
was
available,
had
not
been
decided
by
the
jury
at
that
particular
time,
so
when
it
was
facing
its
decision--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--that's
correct.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
okay,
well,
we
think
they
were
not
faced
with
the
false
dilemma
that
this
court
was
concerned
with
in
simmons,
because
there
was
a
potential
that
he,
in
fact,
would
be
released
from
prison.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
the
jury
did
not
know
anything
about
it,
but
it
was
still
faced
with
the
situation
that
its
decision
did
not
create
that
false
dilemma
because,
in
fact,
he
would
be
available
to
be
released
in
society
based
upon
a
determination
the
jury
made,
that
determination,
whether
in
fact
an
aggravating
factor
existed.
at
the
time
that
question
was
asked,
at
the
time
the
jury
was
making
its
determinations,
that
aggravating
factor
had
not
been
found,
and
in
fact
he
was
still
available
to
be
sentenced
to
be
released
from
prison.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
i'm
not
aware
of
that
particular
number.
i
apologize
for
not
knowing
that,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
i
could
not
say
that
there
have
not
been
any.
those
cases
generally
would
not
have
been
brought
to
my
particular
attention.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
the
statute
became
effective
in
january
1996.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
there
has
been
some
time
in
that
option.
the
existence
of
a
statutory
aggravating
factor
is,
of
course,
one
of
fact.
whether
the
jury
finds
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
its
existence
depends
upon
a
matter
of
proof
which
goes
to
the
judge.
there
has
been
sentencing
under
that
option.
now,
whether
that
was
done
based
upon
the
jury's
failure
to
find
the
statutory
aggravating
factor
or
another
reason,
it's
unclear
to
me.
it
may
have
been
a
guilty
plea
situation
where
they
have
sentenced
beyond
that
30-year
mandatory
minimum
up
to
a
sentence
of
40
and
50
years.
i
am
aware
of
those
situations.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
what
i'm--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--it's...
i
do
not
have
a
true
understanding
as
to
whether
the
jury
did
not
find
those
factors,
or
whether
it
was
a
guilty
plea
situation
where--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--the
judge
did
not
find
those
factors--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--for
a
bench
trial.
i
do
know
that
there
have
been
sentences
above
that
30-year
mandatory
minimum
sentence.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
it's
our
position,
as
we've
stated,
because
the
finding
of
the
statutory
aggravating
factor
is
not
a
ministerial
act,
up
until
the
time
the
jury
enters
its
verdict,
that
in
fact
the
potential
for
release
into
society
is
still
there,
and
it
was
no
false
dilemma--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--they
did
not
know
anything
about
it,
but
if
they
had
been
advised
as
to
what
the
actual
answer
is
particularly
to
their
question,
they
would
have
been
advised,
yes,
there
is
an
option
that
is
available
for
release,
a
30-year
mandatory
minimum
sentence,
which
would
cause
him
to
be
possibly
available
for
release
at
that
time,
while
those
deliberations
were
going
on.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
yes,
that
would
be
correct.
that
would
be
consistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
the
simmons
case.
for
the
second
reason,
we
submit
that
future
dangerousness
was
not
presented
in
this
case,
simmons
was,
in
fact,
not
triggered.
we
agree
that--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--there's
nothing
in
our
particular
statute
that
i
see
that
would
have
prevented
that
situation
from
occurring.
i
don't
know
how
it
would
have
been
set
forth.
it
may
require
some
statutory
change,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
statute,
necessarily,
that
would
have
prevented
that
situation
from
occurring.
it
was
not
asked
for
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
i'm
not
aware
of
it
being
asked
for
in
any
of
the
cases
that
have
gone
up
to
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
which
would
be
three
cases,
the
shafer
case,
the
starnes
case,
and
the
kelly
case
that
was
decided
yesterday.
with
respect
to
the
second
issue,
we
submit
that
while
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
did
not
expressly
decide
future
dangerousness
as
additional
sustaining
grounds,
simmons
did
not
apply
in
this
situation
because
future
dangerousness
was
neither
presented
by
the
evidence
nor
argued
in
this
particular
situation
by
the
prosecutor
from
union
county.
particularly,
this
court
determined
that
when
the
state
argues
future
dangerousness,
it
urges
the
jury
to
sentence
an
individual
to
death
so
that
he
will
no
longer
be
a
threat
to
society.
that
was
not
the
presentation
that
was
made
in
this
particular
case
by
the
prosecution.
in
fact,
at
the
time,
prior
to
the
determination
of
the
sentencing
instructions,
the
trial
judge
conceded
that
future
dangerousness
had
not
been
presented
in
this
case.
the
prosecutor,
recognizing
the
ability
in
simmons
that
it
was
their
option
to
not
argue
future
dangerousness,
which
would
not
bring
the
parole
issue
before
the
jury,
chose
not
to
do
that,
and
expressly
stated
to
the
court
that
it
was
not
going
to
do
that.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
i
think
your...
the
petitioner's
assertion
is
taken
somewhat
out
of
context.
in
the
phrase,
they
might
come
back,
that
was
raised
at
the
time
of
the
crime
itself
by
individuals
who
came
upon
the
crime
scene.
it
was
part
of
the
videotape,
and
it
was
describing
the
crime
itself.
there
was
nothing
about
that
particular
statement
which
was
directed
towards
that
the
defendant
is
a
future
threat
to
society.
what
the--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--he
repeated
it
in
argument
about
the
circumstances
of
the
crime,
when
the
victims
came
upon
the
crime...
when
the
victims,
witnesses
came
upon
the
crime
scene
at
that
particular
situation,
but
then
he
followed
that
up
with,
in
utilizing
the
phrase,
they
might
come
back,
that
was
not
directed
towards
this
defendant
may
come
back,
but
it
was
directed
towards
other
individuals
who
may
come
into
the
counties
of
south
carolina.
it
was
an
argument
not
for
specific
deterrence
of
this
defendant,
but
for
general
deterrence
for
society
as
a
whole
to
make
that
determination,
that
a
death
sentence
in
this
case,
based
upon
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
crime,
not
the
circumstances
of
the
defendant,
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
well,
that
was
part
of...
i
mean,
that
was
what
the
victims
said
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
the
emotional
trauma--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--that's
correct.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
no,
it
was
not
phrased
as
that.
there
was
nothing--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--as
an
argument
against
crime
in
general.
as
an
argument
against
allowing
an
individual
or
individuals
to
come
into
the
state
of
south
carolina
and
commit
these
acts
and
not
be
fairly
punished.
that
is
what
that
statement
was
for,
and
it
was
an
argument
for
specific...
excuse
me,
general
deterrence
against
other
criminals
from
coming
into
that
state
and
not
be
punished.
we
think--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--it
was
a
circumstance
of
the
crime
expressing
people
who
came
upon
that
crime
scene's
immediate
fear
at
what
they
saw,
on
the
brutal
slaying
of
mr.
broome.
that's
what
it
was
an
expression
of.
it
was
a
recognition,
almost
to
some
extent
that
these,
in
fact,
were
victims.
it
was
a
victims'
impact
statement
in
a
phrase
as
to
what
exact
had...
exactly
had
occurred
at
the
time.
they
testified
about
what
occurred
with
them,
and
we
think
that
that
was
fair
comment.
it
was
not
comment
upon
future
dangerousness.
similarly,
we
submit
that
the
presentation
of
the
evidence
that
was
presented
in
the
penalty
phase
of
the
trial
concerning
his
prior
records,
that
does
not
go
to
future
dangerousness.
that
goes
simply
to
the
character
of
this
defendant.
there's
nothing
that
was
utilized
about
those
records
to
show
that
he,
in
fact,
would
have
a
propensity
to
commit
the
crime
in
the
future.
there
was
no
representation
that
those,
in
fact,
suggested
that
he
would
be
a
future
threat.
what
he
was
asking
for
was
a
sentence
in
retribution
that,
in
fact,
this
individual,
based
upon
his
own
unique
character,
deserved
a
death
sentence.
it
was
not
a
question--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--i
think
they
recognize
the
language
from
justice
o'connor's
statement
to
say
if
future
dangerousness
is
not
argued,
then
parole
eligibility
does
not
become
an
issue
for
the
jury,
so
they
are
cognizant
of
that
particular
situation.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
they're
making
that
as
a
tactical
decision--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--realizing
the
benefits
and
the
concerns
that
it
would
have.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
what
they're...
what
they
understand
that
it's
doing
is
to
try
to
not
raise
that
issue,
where
there
may
be
some
due
process
concerns.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
well,
i
think...
i
think
first
off
is
we've
asserted
in
the
third
argument
the
statute
was
initially
given
to
them
when
they
were
told
on
three
occasions
that
life
imprisonment
means
until
the
death
of
the
offender,
or
life
imprisonment
means
incarceration
until
the
death
of
the
offender.
the
concern--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--i
understand
that,
and
in
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
we
believe,
following
this
court's
mandate
in
california
v.
ramos,
believes
that
as
a
policy
that,
in
fact,
the
jury's
attention
should
be
directed
towards
the
characteristics
of
the
defendant
and
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
and
not
other
potential
release
mechanisms
which
may
exist
also.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
well,
it's
up
to
the
trial
judge
to
make
a
determination
as
to
what
is
consistent
with
the
law,
and
under
the
decisions
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
they
have
held--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--the
prosecutor
could
have
said
that.
the
judge
would
not
have
been
bound
by
the
prosecutor's
statement.
the
trial
judge
would
be
bound
to
follow
the
decisions
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
which
consistently
have
said,
parole
eligibility
is
not
an
appropriate
factor
for
a
juror's
consideration,
in
the
same
way
that
they
have
implicitly
said
the
other
collateral
matters
of
potential
release
are
not
appropriate
matters.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
that's
correct.
the
prosecutor
may
have
been
willing
to
do
it,
the
defense
counsel
may
have
been
willing
to
do
it,
but
the
trial
judge
necessarily
would
not
have
had
to
do
it
under
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court,
which
expressly
says
it's
not
supposed
to
be
given
except
when
future
dangerousness
is
argued.
that
was
the
land
of
the
law--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--at
that
time.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
yes.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
pennsylvania
would
be
directly
affected
by
it.
the
cases
we
cite
in
pennsylvania
look
to
whether
an
argument
of
future
dangerousness
is
given.
they've
determined
arguments
or
evidence
of
future
dangerousness
are
not
given
when
they
have
an
aggravating
factor,
if
the
defendant
has
a
prior
history
of
violent
crimes,
when
his
prior
record
is
presented.
they
look,
in
the
same
way
we
submit
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
has
been
looking,
as
to
whether
in
fact
future
dangerousness
is
there.
in
fact,
i
believe
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
says
future
dangerousness
has
to
be
specifically
pointed
out
to
the
jury
for
that
argument
to
in
fact
come
in,
so
pennsylvania
would
be
also
directly
affected
by
whether
that
future
dangerousness--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--well,
i
think
the
state
interest
is
basically
that
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
wants
the
jurors
to
focus
on
the
particular
characteristics
of
the
defendant
and
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
crime,
and
not
be
concerned
with
potential
collateral
matters
such
as
potential
release
which
may
divert
the
attentions
to
some
speculative
issue
which
may
not
in
fact
ever
occur,
that
in
fact
the
life
in
prison
that
they
would
get
with
the
jury
sentence,
whether
it's
parole
eligible
or
not,
may,
in
fact,
under
the
unique
characteristics
of
this
defendant,
be
as
much
as
a
life
sentence
whether
there's
parole
eligibility
or
not,
that
he
would
serve
the
entire
time
in
prison.
again,
addressing
one
of
the
questions
about
the
existence
of
pardon,
pardon
exists
in
south
carolina.
it's
not
in
the
hands
of
the
governor.
it's
in
the
hands
of
the
south
carolina
department
of
probation
and
parole.
they
make
that
determination,
so
that
also
does
exist
as
soon
as
a
conviction
is
entered
on
any
inmate
in
south
carolina.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
i
think
that's
the
state
interest
that
is
concerned
about
going
into
those
collateral
matters,
that
in
fact
those
issues
may
weigh
upon
the
jurors'
decision
but
may
not,
in
fact,
be
what
exactly
happens,
because
the
parole
board
may
be
such
that
it
would
never
parole.
there
may
be
a
parole
board
that
always
paroles,
but
again
there's...
they're
elected
every
4
years,
essentially,
in
south
carolina
and
that
may
change
every
4
years,
so
we
can't
predict
how
that
situation
would
arise
any
more
than
pardon,
any
more
than
a
change
of
law.
we
submit
that
the
instructions
that
were
given
in
this
case
adequately
complied
with
south
carolina
law.
further,
if...
we
also
submit
that
in
fact
what
occurred
in
this
case
should
be
seen
to
satisfy
simmons
because,
as
i
said,
the
jury
was
instructed
on
three
occasions
that
life
imprisonment
in
fact
means
until
death
of
the
offender,
that
life
imprisonment
in
fact
means
incarceration
until
the
death
of
the
offender.
that
is
not
the--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--they--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--that's
correct.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
well,
we
take
the
position
that
it
was
plain
that
life
imprisonment
means
until
the
death
of
the
offender
in
fact
means
imprisonment
until
the
death
of
the
offender.
reasonable
juries
we
think
should
understand
that,
and--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--well,
consistent
with
south
carolina
law
they
said
that
parole
eligibility
or
ineligibility
is
not
for
your
consideration,
but
that
followed
the
language
that
life
imprisonment
means
until
the
death
of
the
offender.
we
think
a
juror
should
have
understood
that
to
mean,
in
fact,
that
he
will
be
in
prison
forever.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
because
under
south
carolina
law
they
were
required
under
state
v.
southerland
to
limit
the
way
that
answer
was
made,
and
the
judge
was
complying
with
the
south
carolina
law
mandate
on
that,
but
also
the
jury
did
not
appear
to
be
confused
because,
consistent
with
this
court's
opinion
in
weeks
v.
angelone,
they're
presumed
to
follow
their
oath
and
instructions,
and
they
did
not
come
back
and
ask
a
further
question
after
they
received
that
information.
the
defense
counsel
was
not
prevented
from
making
his
argument
that
the
defendant,
in
fact,
would
serve
life
in
prison,
in
jail.
in
fact,
it's
clear
that
with
the
information
the
defense
counsel
made,
they
stated,
and
it's
set
forth
at
page
39
and
40
of
our
brief,
that
the
question
is,
will
the
state
execute
him,
or
will
he
just
die
in
prison?
we
ask
that
he
be
able
to
spend
his
natural
life
there.
life
in
prison
until
death.
wesley
shafer
is
going
to
prison
and
staying
there.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
that's
correct.
he
asked
that
that
be
read
as
part
of
the
instruction,
and
he
was
not
authorized
to
have
that
happen.
the
judge
made
a
determination
that
that
shouldn't
be
presented,
because--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--that's
correct.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
no,
i
don't
recall
that
occurring
within
this
particular
record.
it
may
have,
but
my
understanding
was,
what
he
was
seeking
to
do
was
to
in
fact
have
the
judge
make
that
instruction
at
the
time...
at
the
outset
of
the
case,
that
that
language
be
given.
now,
if
the
judge
made
that
instruction--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--yes,
i
will.
i
know
that
there
was
an
earlier
motion
in
limine
made
by
the
prosecution
that
he
not
be
able
to
say
that
there...
the
defendant
be
in
prison
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
that
was
removed,
based
upon
the
way
the
instructions
ended
up
coming
and,
in
fact,
the
defense
counsel
at
page
198
said,
when
they
say
give
him
life,
he's
not
going
home,
a
child
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
in
prison,
send
a
19-year-old
to
prison
for
the
rest
of
his
life,
was
the
argument
that
he
made.
we
submit
that
due
process
in
this
particular
case
was
satisfied.
there
was
no
false
dilemma
presented
by
either
the
facts
or
circumstances,
or
the
law
as
defined
in
this
particular
case,
and
we
would
request
that
the
conviction
and
death
sentence
of
wesley
shafer
be
affirmed.
