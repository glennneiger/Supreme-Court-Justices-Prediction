chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
00-5250,
shafer
v.
south
carolina.
we'll
wait
just
a
minute.
mr.
bruck.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
the
court
presented
a
veiled
metaphorical
argument.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
prosecutor...
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
justice
o'connor's
opinion
in
that
case,
which
two
of
the
rest
of
us
joined,
does
say
that
one
of
the
conditions
of
simmons
is
the
prosecution
argued
that
the
defendant
will
pose
a
threat
to
society
in
the
future.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
shouldn't
we
take
that
as
a
holding
of
the
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bruck,
you
said
that
the
state
asks
us
to
remand.
as
i
understand
their
brief,
they
first
ask
us
to
affirm
and
then
say,
if
the
court
decides
to
reverse
it,
it
should
be
remanded.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
follow
so
far
as
i
can
see.
i
mean,
prison
is
a
much
more
restrictive
environment,
and
a
person
who
is
prone
to
dangerousness
might
well
confine
themselves
in
prison
during...
under
constant
supervision.
he
gets
out,
and
he
isn't
under
any
supervision,
and
might
behave
differently.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
bruck,
suppose...
i
take
it,
does
the
governor
in
south
carolina
have
the
power
to
pardon?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
in
a
state
where
the
governor
does
have
the
power
to
pardon,
and
the
court
says,
we
want
to
give...
we
want
you
to
give
a
simmons
instruction,
could
the
state
say,
well,
in
addition
to
that,
please
say
that
the
governor
does
have
the
authority
to
pardon
this
defendant?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that...
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
she
was
the
one
that
drove
into
the
lake?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bruck,
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
you
didn't
have
a
chance
to
get
your
side
of
the
argument
to
the
jury.
certainly
the
defense
counsel
could
have
stated
to
the
jury,
he'll
never
get
out
of
prison
because
the
alternative
is
life
without
parole.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
now,
are
you
saying
that...
in
south
carolina
do
you
have
to
submit
in
advance
your
arguments
to
the
other
side?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
bruck.
mr.
zelenka,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
if
the
prosecutor
had
said,
i
have
no
objection
to
the
giving
of
a
simmons
instruction,
that
would
not
necessarily
have
meant
it
would
have
been
given
if
the
trial
judge
had
felt
it
was
not
consistent
with
the
rulings
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
or
this
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
had
understood
from
your
colleague
that
not
only
was
the
instruction
refused,
but
the
effort
of
the
defense
counsel
to
himself
read
the
statute
as
part
of
his
closing
argument
was
refused.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
zelenka.
mr.
bruck,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bruck.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
00-5250,
shafer
against
south
carolina
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
