mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent
waived
its
immunity
from
suit
when
it
entered
into
a
contract
expressing
its
willingness
to
submit
to
binding
arbitration
and
judicial
confirmation
of
the
arbitration
award
in
state
court.
we
think
that
the
test
should
be
with
respect
to
evaluating
a
waiver
of
tribal
immunity
whether
the
contract
states
a
waiver
by
sufficiently
expressed
language
or
by
overwhelming
implication
from
the
text
such
that
by
applying
the
traditional
rules
of
construction,
the
only
reasonable
interpretation
is
that
the
tribe
intended
to
subject
itself
to
suit
on
the
contract.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
think
if
the
contract
otherwise
says
we
agree
to
be
sued,
and
there
is
a
forum
selection
clause,
that
those
together
certainly
would
be
effective.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
don't
believe
that
that
would
do
it,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
believe
not,
your
honor,
for
a
couple
of
different
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
standards
that
the
states
have
set
for
waiving
their
own
immunity
are
matters
of
state
law
and
the
states
have
adopted
a
variety
of
standards
so
one
can't
speak
of
a
uniform
standard
of
waiver.
but,
more
importantly,
the
eleventh
amendment
developed
in
a
different
way.
this
court
in
chisolm
said
that
the
states
didn't
have
immunity
from
suit
in
federal
court.
and
it
took
a
separate
amendment
to
the
constitution,
which
now
emanates
from
the
federal
government
to
protect
the
states
from
suit.
it
is
a
federally
imposed
limitation
on
the
federal
court's
own
jurisdiction
that
emanates.
and
therefore,
we
believe
it
is
somewhat
separate
and
apart
from
the
state's
own
sovereign
immunity
with
respect
to
waiver.
with
that
in
part--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--this
court
has
stated
a
standard
from
time
to
time
with
respect
to
waivers.
but,
the
court
has
not
really
been
in
the
position
of
having
been
asked
specifically
what
that
standard
is.
so,
the
language
from
santa
clara
pueblo
has
simply
come
forward
to
the
state
without
really
being
used
in
any
specific
case
and
without
being
tested.
and
that
is
what
is
at
issue
today
before
the
court.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
think
i
am
asking
the
court
to
adopt
this
same
test,
and
that
is
the
test
set
out
in
edelman
and
repeated
in
the
atascadero,
which
is
it
should
be
sufficiently
expressed,
or
by
overwhelming
implication
from
the
text--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--because
the
eleventh
amendment
contains
a
specific
requirement
as
to
federal
court.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
let
me
correct
my
answer,
justice
stevens.
i
didn't
understand
it
in
that
way.
if
there
were
authorization
to
waive
a
state's
immunity
in
this
fashion,
then
we
believe
that
it
could
be
waived
by
this
kind
of
language.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
we
have
two
basic
arguments.
one
is
that
we
agree
with
the
petitioner
here
that
the
subject
matter
of
jurisdiction
of
the
tribal
courts
is
limited
by
montana
and
by
straight.
and
that
therefore,
because
this
is
a
contract
involving
off
reservation
commercial
activities,
the
tribal
court's
jurisdiction
cannot
extend
to
this
type
of
activity.
and
therefore,
there
could
be
no
expectation
by
either
party
that
the
arbitration
confirmation
would
be
in
tribal
court.
we
also
would
argue--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
believe
it's
federal
law,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
the--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--going
back
to
the
basic
analysis
that
this
court
laid
out
in
kennecott
copper,
it
talked
about
the
fact
that
state
courts
are
courts
of
general
jurisdiction.
and
in
our
dual
system,
the
state
courts
are
the
only
courts
of
general
jurisdiction.
and
so,
with
the
eleventh
amendment
overlay,
there
is
a
question
when
you
say
any
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
that
that
means
state
court.
but,
the
tribal
courts
themselves
are
courts
of
very
limited
jurisdiction
and
it's
not
clear
that
saying
any
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
would
ratchet
down
to
the
tribal
court,
but
would
rather
continue
to
apply
to
the
state
court,
particularly
when
the
contract
is
adopting
state
law.
it
incorporates
the
oklahoma
uniform
arbitration
act,
which
defines
the
only
court
under
that
act
that
can
confirm
an
arbitration
award
as
oklahoma
state
court.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
think
for
on
reservation
activity,
there
is
probably
that
ability.
but,
that
wasn't
done
in
this
case
and
i
have
not
seen
a
case
where
there
has
been
any
agreement
to
do
that.
i
certainly
don't
think
that
contractors
expect
to
be
brought
in
to
tribal
court
or
to
be
forced
to
bring
their
suits
to
confirm
in
tribal
court.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
that
is
one
reason.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
if
you
sue--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--no.
i
think
that
they
could,
but
not
specifically
by
suing
under
the
oklahoma
arbitration
act.
that
would
have
to
be
brought
under
the
federal
arbitration
act.
but,
i
think
under
the
rules
they
could
have
gone
into
either
court.
they
chose
oklahoma
and
they
chose
to
come
under
the
oklahoma
act.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
we
agree
that
they
are
directly
incorporated
by
the
parties.
in
fact,
if
c
&
l
had
attempted
to
confirm
its
award
in
tribal
court,
there
could
have
been
an
objection
that
they
had
not
followed
the
arbitration
rules
which
were
incorporated
which
they
agreed
to.
they
were
bound
by
those
rules
as
much
as
the
tribe
was
and
they
simply
could
not
under
their
agreement
bring
that
confirmation
action
in
tribal
court.
that
is
why
we
think
under
these
circumstances
that
the
tribe
waived
its
immunity
as
to
a
confirmation
suit
in
tribal
court.
and
we
think
also
that
the
united
states
discussion
of
finney
in
its
brief
suggests
that
if
they
were
to
view
the
arbitration
agreement
as
more
than
a
simple
agreement
to
arbitrate,
but
to
evaluate
the
incorporation
of
those
arbitration
rules,
as
was
the
state
statute
in
finney
and
as
this
court
considered
by
reference
in
kimmel,
that
they
too
would
agree
that
there
has
been
a
sufficient
pointing
to
the
court
that
the
action
should
be
brought
in,
that
this
agreement
taken
as
a
whole
and
interpreted
according
to
the
usual
rules
of
construction,
clearly
indicates
the
tribe
was
willing
to
subject
itself
not
merely
to
suit
generally,
but
also
to
suit
or
more
specifically
to
suit
in
oklahoma
state
court
for
confirmation
of
an
arbitration
award.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
the
state
doesn't
have
a
position
on
that.
but,
what
we
will
say
is
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
an
issue
before
the
court.
it
may
be
determined
on
remand
if
it's
necessary.
if
the
court
determines
that
there
has
been
a
waiver,
that
there
is
a
waiver
in
the
language,
certainly
the
tribe
may
want
to
assert
that
defense
again.
but,
it
comes
up
before
this
court
with
the
presumption
that
authority
existed.
and
certainly,
25
usc
section
81,
which
was
recently
amended,
clearly
contemplates
that
the
tribes
will
and
can
waive
their
sovereign
immunity
in
the
contracts
themselves.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
there
was
an
initial
assertion.
that
is
my
understanding.
it
was
asserted,
but
was
not
decided.
