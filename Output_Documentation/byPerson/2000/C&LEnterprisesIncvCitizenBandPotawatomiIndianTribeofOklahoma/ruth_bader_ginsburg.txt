justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
three
years
ago
in
kiowa
tribe
against
manufacturing
technologies,
this
court
held
that
an
indian
tribe
enjoys
sovereign
immunity
from
suit
in
a
state
court,
even
for
off-reservation
commercial
conduct,
unless
congress
has
authorized
the
suit
or
the
tribe
waives
its
immunity.
today’s
case
presents
the
question
whether
a
tribe
waives
its
suit
immunity,
when
it
subscribes
to
a
contract
calling
for
arbitration
as
the
means
by
which
the
parties
will
resolve
their
disputes.
some
years
ago,
the
citizen
potawatomi
nation,
a
federally
recognize
indian
tribe,
entered
into
a
standard
form
construction
contract
with
c&l
enterprises.
under
the
contract,
c&l
was
to
install
a
roof
on
the
tribe
owned
bank
building,
in
shawnee,
oklahoma.
two
provisions
of
the
tribe
c&l
contract
are
key
here.
the
first
is
a
clause
calling
for
arbitration
of
all
contractual
disputes
between
the
parties.
the
regime
for
arbitration,
the
contract
specifies
is
the
one
set
out
in
the
construction
industry,
arbitration
rules
of
the
american
arbitration
association.
those
rules
state
that,
“parties
to
agreement
of
the
kind
the
tribe
and
c&l
signed,
consent
to
the
entry
of
judgment
upon
an
arbitration
award
in
any
federal
or
state
court
having
jurisdiction
thereof.”
the
second
key
provision
is
a
choice
of
law
clause
stating,
“the
contract
shall
be
governed
by
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
construction
project
is
located,”
here
oklahoma.
oklahoma’s
arbitration
act
instructs
that
the
making
of
an
agreement,
providing
for
arbitration
in
oklahoma,
confers
jurisdiction
on
the
court
to
enforce
the
agreement
and
to
enter
judgment
on
an
award
there
under.
the
act
defines
court
to
mean
any
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
of
this
state.
before
c&l
began
working
under
the
contract,
the
tribe
retained
another
company
to
install
the
roof.
claiming
that
the
tribe
had
dishonored
the
contract,
c&l
sought
arbitration
and
gained
an
award
for
damages,
attorney’s
fees,
and
cost.
c&l
successfully
sued
to
enforce
the
award
and
the
district
court
of
oklahoma
county,
a
state
court
of
general
first
instance,
jurisdiction.
on
appeal
however,
the
oklahoma
appellate
court
held
that
the
tribe
had
not
waived
its
suit
immunity
with
the
requisite
clarity,
and
therefore,
ordered
the
district
court
to
dismiss
c&l's
case.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
conflict
amongst
state
and
federal
courts
on
the
question
whether
an
arbitration
clause,
providing
for
judicial
enforcement
arbitration
award,
waives
tribal
immunity
from
a
suit
stemming
from
the
contract.
the
answer
our
opinion
explains
is
yes.
to
relinquish
its
immunity,
a
tribe’s
waiver
must
be
clear.
the
tribe
in
this
case,
we
conclude,
has
waived
its
immunity
from
c&l's
suit
with
the
requisite
clarity.
the
tribe
expressly
agreed
to
adhere
to
a
certain
dispute
resolution
procedure.
in
fact
the
tribe
itself
tendered
the
contract
that
called
for
that
procedure.
the
regime
to
which
the
tribe
subscribed,
includes
entry
of
judgment
upon
an
arbitral
award
in
accordance
with
the
oklahoma
arbitration
act,
that
act
indicates
as
a
proper
enforcement
forum
the
very
court
in
which
c&l
brought
suit.
the
judgment
of
the
oklahoma
court
of
civil
appeals
holding
the
tribe
immune
from
c&l’s
suit
is
therefore
reversed.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
