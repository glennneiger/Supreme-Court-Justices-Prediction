mr.
john
d.
mashburn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
potawatomi
indian
tribe
on
august
25th,
1993
presented
a
contract
to
c
&
l
enterprises
for
the
construction
of
a
roof
upon
a
bank
building
that
the
tribe
was
building
off
of
the
reservation.
the
contract
contained
an
arbitration
provision
specifically
adopting
the
rules
of
the
american
arbitration
association
and
also
specifically
providing
that
the
award,
the
arbitration
award
in
such
proceedings,
would
be
enforceable
by
judgment.
there
is
no
question
that
the
arbitration
agreement
provided
that
the
tribe
waived
its
immunity
as
to
the
american
arbitration
association
and
its
arbitration
proceedings.
there
is
no--
mr.
john
d.
mashburn
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
we
believe
the
standard,
that
no
standard
has
required
that
it
specifically
state
we
waive
sovereign
immunity.
rather
they
clearly
stated
we
agree
to
be
brought
into
the
american
arbitration
association
and
to
be
subjected
to
arbitration,
a
binding
arbitration.
they
went
further
than
that
and
they
said
in
the
agreement
we
agree
that
a
judgment
may
be
entered
upon
that.
mr.
john
d.
mashburn
and
the
ambiguity
that
the
respondent
attempts
to
raise
is
regarding
which
court
is
being
referred
to
where
the
phrase
recites
any
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
however,
we
believe
that
that
argument
of
ambiguity
fails
for
four
reasons.
first,
the
american
arbitration
association
rule
47c,
which
is
incorporated
by
the
very
terms
of
the
clause,
states
that
awards
under
their
procedures
may
be
enforced
as
a
judgement
in
any
federal
or
state
court.
the
contract
itself
selects
oklahoma
law
as
governing
law
in
addition
to
this
court's
rulings
in
mescalero,
oklahoma
tax
commission
v.
potawatomi
organized
village
of
cocky.
all
of
those
saying
that
when
the
tribe
goes
off
the
reservation,
it
is
subject
to
the
substantive
laws
of
the
state.
the
third
reason
is
the
tribal
court
is
not
mentioned
anywhere
in
the
contract.
and
the
fourth
reason
is
we
don't
believe
the
tribal
court
would
have
had
jurisdiction
to
even
hear
this
case
under
the
ruling
in
montana
v.
united
states
because
it
is
undoubtedly
non-indian
not
on
the
reservation.
mr.
john
d.
mashburn
because
despite--
mr.
john
d.
mashburn
--we
believe
that
that
type
of
jurisdiction
is
in
fact
subject
matter
jurisdiction
because
under
the
ruling
in
montana
v.
united
states,
the
court
indicated
that
tribes
don't
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
matters
unless
it's
been
specifically
given
to
them
by
the
constitution
or
statute.
mr.
john
d.
mashburn
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
one
of
the
two
exceptions
that
are
carved
out
under
montana
is
for
a
party
that
enters
into
a
consensual
agreement.
however,
montana
doesn't
even
get
to,
we
believe,
those
exceptions
until
you
find
that
it's
on
reservation
activity.
all
of
the
activity
discussed
in
montana
and
in
the
cases
we've
reviewed
following
that
regard
on
reservation
activity.
mr.
john
d.
mashburn
yes.
but,
the
question
is
more
difficult
and
if
i
could
explain.
mr.
john
d.
mashburn
under
this
court's
ruling
in
edelman
v.
jordan
regarding
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
the
court
stated
that
the
rule
is
that
the
waiver,
and
again
this
one
applies,
as
you
know,
to
eleventh
amendment
immunity
from
suit
in
federal
court,
but
the
courts
even
there
stated
that
the
ruling
regarding
whether
a
provision
waives
such
immunity
is
that
it
must
be
stated
by
the
most
express
language
or
by
such
overwhelming
implications
from
the
text
as
will
leave
no
room
for
any
other
reasonable
construction.
and
in
this
situation,
under
the
same
circumstances,
we
believe
that
that
standard
would
find
a
waiver
because
there
is
no
other
reasonable
construction
of
this
clause
when
you
take
what
the
clause
incorporates.
and
in
fact,
in
this
court's
ruling
in
port
authority
v.
feeney,
and
subsequently
in
kimmel
v.
florida
board
of
regents,
the
court
recognized
that
the
consent
provision
may
look
to
other
provisions.
in
the
port
authority,
it
looked
to
a
venue
provision.
and
in
kimmel,
it
looked
for
an
ada
claim;
it
looked
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
found--
mr.
john
d.
mashburn
--no,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
do
not.
we
believe
that
that
is
peculiar
to
the
states
and
that
that
at
the
very
most
is
the
highest
standard
that
this
court
should
apply
and
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
appropriate
for
an
indian
tribe.
mr.
john
d.
mashburn
there
is
some
discussion
of
that
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
cairo
that
it
appears
that
that's
what
the
court
is
doing.
we
don't
believe
that
that's
what
the
court
intended
to
do.
and
certainly,
we
don't
believe
that
that's
the
rule
that
should
be
followed
here.
we
believe
that
the
court
should
find
a
waiver
if
there
is
simply
a
clear
statement
that
using
the
usual
rules
of
contract
construction
that
the
tribe
agreed
that
upon
a
breach
it
could
be
brought
to
court
and
sued
for
the
breach
of
that
contract.
mr.
john
d.
mashburn
no,
your
honor,
we
don't
believe
that
it
does.
first
of
all,
we
believe
that
a
distinction
has
to
be
drawn.
in
that
instance,
congress
was
attempting
to
bring
some
uniformity
to
a
variation
of
rules
that
had
been
applied.
and
in
fact,
as
this
court
recited
the
history
of
foreign
sovereign
immunity
in
the
cairo
case,
there
had
been
a
move
from
virtually
no
immunity
to
virtually
total
immunity
under
i
believe
it
was
the
tate
letter.
and
then,
shrinking
back
from
that,
and
then
applying
implied
consent
from
commercial
operations.
we
don't
believe
that
the
fact
that
they
acted
there
to
specifically
provide
that
as
a
waiver
indicates
that
where
they
have
not
acted
that
there
is
no
waiver.
and
in
fact,
we
believe
the
court
can
take
guidance
from
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
and
from
cases
leading
up
to
that
finding
waivers
from
entering
into
commercial
relations,
or
in
particular
arbitration
agreements,
and
find
that
that
is
within
the
appropriate
policy
that
the
united
states
has
followed.
mr.
john
d.
mashburn
no,
your
honor,
i
believe
you
have
to
look
to
the
specific
term
here
in
the
arbitration
agreement.
mr.
john
d.
mashburn
that's
correct.
but,
as
a
general
rule,
we
believe
that
if
the
arbitration
agreement,
first
of
all,
if
it
incorporates
rules,
as
this
one
does
from
the
american
arbitration
association,
then
we
think
it's
perfectly
appropriate
for
the
court
to
look
to
those
rules
and
the
parties
are
both
on
notice
that
those
rules
are
going
to
govern
the
procedures.
we
also
believe--
mr.
john
d.
mashburn
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
it
is
correct
that
it
was
simply
a
codification
of
what
was
the
emerging
case
law
in
the
field.
it
certainly
is
appropriate
for
this
court
to
draw
a
waiver
rule
as
lenient
as
the
foreign
sovereign
immunity
rule,
and
certainly
no
more
strict
than
the
eleventh
amendment
waiver
rule.
and
this
court
has
complete
authority
to
do
that
because,
as
your
honor
has
stated,
this
court
recognized
in
cairo
that
it
is
a
court
created
doctrine.
especially
in
the
context
that
it
tends
to
impinge
on
the
state's
rights
and
be
court
created,
we
believe
there's
even
more
argument
for
the
court
to
move
cautiously
in;
certainly
in
expanding
any
immunity
that
has
been
afforded
to
indian
tribes.
mr.
john
d.
mashburn
no,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
there
is
and
the
reason
that
there
is
is
because
first
of
all
it
adopts
the
american
arbitration
association
rule
which
says
the
award
may
be
enforced
in
state
or
federal
court.
secondly,
it
adopts
oklahoma's
arbitration
act,
which
says
that
the
award
may
be
enforced
in
any
court
of
the
state.
and
we
believe
when
you
combine
that
with
the
fact
that,
in
our
opinion,
the
tribal
court
would
not
have
had
jurisdiction,
there
is
no
ambiguity
that
the
court
that
is
being
selected
is
not
the
tribal
court.
so,
the
only
other
alternative
would
be
to
argue
that
the
term,
that
the
provision
was
meaningless
and
that
it
was
selecting
no
court.
but,
we
don't
even
believe
that
that
argument
holds
water
because
the
parties
had
adopted
oklahoma
law
specifically.
the
parties
have
adopted
the
american
arbitration
association
rules.
and
under
both
of
those
bodies
of
law,
the
forum
is
either,
you
know,
from
a
state
court
or
a
federal
court,
not
the
tribal
court.
mr.
john
d.
mashburn
because
under
the
court's
ruling
in
montana
v.
united
states,
the
court
indicated
that
unless
there
was
specific
statute
or
constitutional
provision
providing
for
jurisdiction
over
civil
matters
by
the
indian
tribe,
that
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
off
the
reservation.
mr.
john
d.
mashburn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
mashburn
not
in
this
case.
no
parties--
mr.
john
d.
mashburn
--i'm
not
aware
of
whether
they
have
or
not,
your
honor.
no
party
has
attempted
to
bring
any
action
in
tribal
court
in
this
case
at
any
time.
mr.
john
d.
mashburn
i
agree
that's
a
different
question.
and
if
the
court
views
that
as
more
a
personal
jurisdiction
question,
then
certainly
a
non-indian
party
could
consider
it
in
that
court.
mr.
john
d.
mashburn
well,
we
believe
the
waiver
would
also
include
waiving
immunity
in
the
tribal
court,
yes.
mr.
john
d.
mashburn
i'm
sure
that
they
would
assert
that
they
are
immune
from
suit
in
their
own
court.
i
need
to
clarify
one
matter
though
for
your
previous
question,
your
honor.
there
is
some
question
because
the
agreement
incorporates
the
american
arbitration
association
rules
and
because
that
makes
no
reference
to
bringing
an
action
to
enforce
the
award
in
anything
other
than
state
and
federal
court.
i
suppose
there
could
be
some
question
there
whether
they
were
consenting
to
suit
in
their
own
court.
however,
no
party
has
asserted
tribal
court
jurisdiction
here.
no
party
has
attempted
to
bring
any
action
in
tribal
court.
mr.
john
d.
mashburn
if
this
were
a
state,
we
would
say
that
it
meant
state
court
because
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
we
do
not
question
that
the
tribe
could
have
said
you
may
sue
us,
but
only
in
tribal
court.
but,
the
language
of
the
contract
simply
does
not
indicate
that.
the
language
of
the
contract,
especially
when
you
incorporate
the
american
arbitration
association
rules
that
say
state
or
federal
court,
certainly
does
not
indicate
that
the
tribal
court
is
going
to
be
the
exclusive
court
of
jurisdiction,
if
it
indicates
tribal
court
at
all.
mr.
john
d.
mashburn
no,
your
honor,
i
may
not
have
made
myself
clear.
i
was
attempting
to
respond
in
the
sense
that
if
that's
the
way
the
court
reviewed
what's
going
on
in
montana
as
personal
jurisdiction,
i
do
not
believe
it
is.
i
believe
montana
speaks
in
terms
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
and
i
do
not
retreat
from
the
statement
that
if
it
is
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
that
in
the
ordinary
sense
it
would
not
be
able
to
be
conferred
on
the
court
simply
by
the
parties
agreeing
to
it.
and
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
john
d.
mashburn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
unless
there
are
further
questions,
we
would
waive
our
rebuttal.
