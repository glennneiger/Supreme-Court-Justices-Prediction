unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
didn't
use
the
magic
phrase.
it
didn't
say
waive
immunity.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
but,
what
if
the
non-indian
brought
the
suit
in
the
tribal
court?
why
wouldn't
it
have
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
you
must
be
suing
on
the
arbitration
order.
it
seemed
to
me
you
would
waive
any
objection
to
tribal
jurisdiction
if
you
brought
the
suit.
unknown
speaker
but,
there's
a
consensual
exception
to
montana
too,
is
there
not,
where
there's
a
consensual
transaction
between
the
tribe
and
a
non-indian?
unknown
speaker
now,
if
the
very
same
clause
were
in
a
contract
that
your
client
entered
into
with
a
state,
do
you
think
that
we
would
have
found
a
waiver
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity?
unknown
speaker
i
would
have
thought
we
wouldn't,
that
our
cases
would
have
said
not,
that
wouldn't
be
enough
to
waive
sovereign
immunity.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
concede,
mr.
mashburn,
that
an
indian
tribe
has
the
same
sort
of
immunity
as
the
state
under
the
eleventh
amendment?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
some
ways,
indian
tribes
have
been
given
more
immunity
than
states,
hasn't
that
been
the--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
mashburn,
as
this
respects
foreign
sovereigns,
congress
in
1988
made
the
specific
provision
that
if
you
agreed
to
an
arbitration
dispute
settlement
mechanism,
then
you
have
no
immunity.
the
congress
did
that
by
statute
and
doesn't
that
imply
that
when
congress
doesn't
do
it
by
statute,
the
immunity
persists?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
take
the
position
do
you,
maybe
you
do,
that
any
arbitration
agreement
necessarily
implies
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity?
unknown
speaker
you're
dealing
with
this
one.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
of
course,
was
just
tracking
developments
in
international
law
that
had
generally
allowed
suit
on
commercial
transactions
by
states.
why
do
you
think
it's
open
to
us
to
apply
such
a
rule
to
the
sovereign
immunity
of
indian
tribes,
which
we
made
up
ourselves
anyway,
right?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mashburn,
even
if
you
could...
you've
agreed
the
agreement
is
saying
yes,
they
agreed
to
arbitration.
that's
explicit
right
out
there
that
but
they
are
going
to
resolve
this
through
arbitration.
but,
where
do
you
get
tied
to
that,
that
the
court
to
enforce
the
arbitration
award
would
be
a
state
court?
there
is
no
explicit
agreement
to
that
by
the
tribe,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
the
reason
that
the
tribal
court
would
not
have
had
jurisdiction
is--
unknown
speaker
--so,
even
if,
are
there,
is
there
a
tribal
court?
unknown
speaker
and
has
it
had
any
arbitration
proceedings?
unknown
speaker
have
they
asserted
jurisdiction
over
arbitration
in
other
cases?
unknown
speaker
i
wouldn't
have
thought
that
the
montana
case
would
prohibit
a
non-indian
from
choosing
to
resort
to
tribal
court
jurisdiction.
i
mean,
if
your
client
wanted
to
go
into
tribal
court
to
enforce
it,
i
wouldn't
have
thought
montana
would
be
a
barrier.
that
arose
in
the
context
of
a
tribal
court
or
a
tribal
plaintiff
trying
to
force
a
defendant
into
tribal
court.
now,
that's
a
different
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
any
indication
that
the
tribe
would
waive
its
immunity
in
its
own
court
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
assume
you
lose
in
this
court
on
the
interpretation
of
the
contract,
i
take
it
that
the
tribe
would
say
that
they're
immune
from
suit
in
their
own
court
as
well.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
well,
obviously
not
because
you
were
going
to
sue
them
in
state
court.
but,
they
say
the
words,
we
agree
to
be
sued
in
any
court
meaning
any
tribal
court.
now,
what's
the
answer
to
that
argument?
you
say
they're
not
able
to
say
that
in
a
contract?
why
not?
you
and
your
client
and
they
could
sign
a
contract
saying
we
want
to
be
sued
in
a
tribal
court.
is
there
a
tribal
court?
yes.
what
happens
if
they
try
to
assert
immunity
in
their
tribal
court?
you
say
you
signed
a
promise
here
not
to
by
your
own
words.
so,
what's
the
problem?
i
mean,
if
this
were
a
state,
we'd
say
it
meant
any
state
court.
this
is
a
tribe,
so
they're
saying
by
analogy
it
means
any
tribal
court.
now,
what's
the
answer
to
that?
there's
a
kind
of
black
hole
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mashburn,
you
are
now
retreating
from
a
position
that
you
started
out
originally
because
you
answered
justice
o'connor's
question
if
we're
talking
about
personal
jurisdiction,
of
course,
you
can
submit
to
personal
jurisdiction.
but,
before
that,
you
were
taking
a
position
about
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
tribal
courts.
you
were
saying
that
parties
can't
confer
subject
matter
jurisdiction
on
the
court.
and
if
we
follow
that
reasoning,
then
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor
should
have
been
no.
these
courts
are
simply
powerless
to
entertain
the
case
where
one
of
the
litigants
is
a
non-member
and
the
episode
and
suit
occurred
off
reservation,
you
started
out,
are
you
abandoning
that
position?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
mashburn.
mr.
coleman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
what
about
a
forum
selection
clause?
would
that
comply
with
your
test
because
you
want
to
know
what
that
says?
but,
the
standard
forum
selection
clause?
unknown
speaker
but,
it's
not
if
it
just
says
in
any
dispute
between
the
parties
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york
will
apply?
that
wouldn't
do
it?
unknown
speaker
would
this
clause
have
sufficed
to
waive
state
sovereign
immunity
for
eleventh
amendment
purposes
if
it
were
state
instead
of
a
tribe?
unknown
speaker
how
about
cases
that
have
delineated
a
narrower
immunity
for
tribes,
indian
tribes?
unknown
speaker
you're
asking
us
to
adopt
a
rather
confusing
body
of
law.
we
have
one
set
of
standards
for
when
an
indian
tribe
is
deemed
to
have
waived
its
sovereign
immunity
and
another
for
the
state
and,
why
should
we
do
that?
unknown
speaker
perhaps
i
misunderstood.
i
thought
you
indicated
to
justice
o'connor
that
this
would
be
insufficient
to
waive
immunity
if
it
were
the
state
that
was
involved.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
her
question
didn't
just
ask
you
about
the
eleventh
amendment.
it
could
be
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
pursuant
in
the
state's
own
courts?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
answer
then?
that
they
say
the
words,
this
agreement
shall
be
specifically
enforceable
in
any
court
having
jurisdiction
means
in
any
tribal
court
having
jurisdiction,
and
why
doesn't
it
mean
that?
so,
why...
i
mean
that's
a
possible
reading.
what's
wrong
with
their
argument?
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
interrupt
you
if
i
may.
what
is
it
that
imposes
the
limit
on
the
tribal
court's
jurisdiction?
you
talked
about
montana.
is
it
federal
law,
state
law
or
tribal
law
or
all
three?
unknown
speaker
the
federal
law
prohibits
an
indian
tribe
from
accepting...
a
tribal
court
from
accepting
jurisdiction
in
a
case
like
this?
that's
your
position?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
wait
a
second,
i'd
like
to
get
both.
you
had
a
second
answer.
this
is
in...
i
just
want
to
know
what
your
second
answer
is.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
rather
strange
to
me
that
they
can
agree
to
an
arbitration
by
the
american
arbitration
association,
which
is
a
private
body,
but
then
they
couldn't
further
agree
that
the
arbitration
would
be
enforceable
in
an
indian
court.
unknown
speaker
now,
you
say
that
would
allow
them
to
get
into
state
court
because
the
arbitration
agreement
incorporates
the
state
arbitration
act,
which
refers
to
a
state
court
of
general
jurisdiction,
right?
unknown
speaker
but,
the
arbitration
agreement
also
incorporates
the
rules
of
the
american
arbitration
association,
which
allows
them
to
get
into
any
state
or
federal
court.
now,
which
one
of
the
two
do
you
want
to
have
been
incorporated?
why
should
we
prefer
the
one
rather
than
the
other?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
they
couldn't
get
into
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
so,
you're
not
contradicting
the
assertion
that
the
rules
of
the
american
arbitration
association
were
incorporated,
which
refer
to
both
state
and
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
mr.
coleman,
what
do
you
make
of
the
argument
that
going
back
even
before
we
get
to
the
arbitration
clause,
that
the
people
who
negotiated
this
contract
had
no
authority
to
do
so
because
they
didn't
officially
represent
the
business
council.
unknown
speaker
was
the
authority
contested
in
the
oklahoma
courts
from
which
this
case
came
to
us?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
coleman.
mr.
minnis,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
isn't
there
more
here
than
a
mere
arbitration
clause
and
let
me
direct
you
to
the
language
that
concerns
me.
i'm
quoting
it
from
page
of
the
blue
brief,
page
six.
the
relevant...
page
six
on
the
blue
brief.
the
relevant
language
in
the
middle
of
the
block
quotes
is
this
"the
award
rendered
by
the
arbitrators.
"
i'm
skipping
"shall
be
final
and
judgment
may
be
entered
upon
it
in
accordance
with
applicable
law
in
any
court
having
jurisdiction
thereof.
"
that
reference
to
jurisdiction
thereof
has
to
mean
jurisdiction
to
enter
judgment
on
an
arbitration
award.
so,
it
is
describing
a
court
by
reference
to
a
certain
kind
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
that
that
court
has.
when
they
agree
that
in
effect
they
will
be
subject
to
a
court,
having
that
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
when
they
agree
that
they
are
subject
to
any
court
having
that
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
isn't
that
a
pretty
clear
waiver
and
doesn't
it
go
beyond
certainly
merely
an
agreement
to
arbitrate?
and
doesn't
it
go
beyond
merely
an
agreement
to
be
subject
to
a
court
with
jurisdiction
or
with
competent
jurisdiction?
isn't
it
pretty
darn
specific
in
identifying
courts
by
reference
to
a
certain
subject
matter?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
but,
it
does--
unknown
speaker
--but,
it
does
take
it
out
of
the
ambit
of
those
cases
that
are
merely
considered
references
to
courts
of
competent
jurisdiction
in
which
the
reference
to
the
jurisdiction
in
those
cases
is
far
less
specific
than
it
is
here.
isn't
that
true?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
what
does
the
fact
that
it's
boiler
plate
language
have
anything
to
do
with
it?
unknown
speaker
then,
the
answer
is,
is
it
not...
it
isn't
a
severely
specific
waiver.
i
don't
see
why
the
fact
that
it's
boiler
plate
cuts
one
way
or
the
other.
unknown
speaker
these
were
customers
of
a
securities
firm?
unknown
speaker
these
were
customers
of
a
securities
firm?
unknown
speaker
and
does
it
matter
here
that
apparently,
and
we
are
told,
and
i
gather
without
contradiction,
that
it
was
the
tribe
that
prompted
this
agreement?
it
was
the
tribe
that
proposed
using
this
form.
unknown
speaker
is
that
correct?
and
doesn't
that
make
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
does
the
word
in...
and
does
the
word
in
any
court
mean
in
any
tribal
court
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
and
what
else
could
it
include?
unknown
speaker
you
say
could,
what
else?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
includes
state
court,
then
they
have
said
shall
be
specifically
enforceable
in
any
state
court.
so,
that's
the
end
of
this
case.
unknown
speaker
no.
i'm
saying
in
your
opinion,
what
does
it
mean?
does
it
mean
in
any
tribal
court?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
could,
what
else
could
it
mean?
unknown
speaker
sorry.
there
are
words,
in
any
court.
unknown
speaker
i'm
asking
a
simple
question.
you
say
those
words
do
not
mean,
do
not
include
state
court.
so,
i
want
to
know
what
in
your
opinion
they
do
include.
unknown
speaker
fine.
now,
my
next
question
is,
is
there
a
tribal
court?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
my
next
question
is,
has
that
tribal
court
ever
considered
an
arbitration
case
involving
people
off
the
reservation?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
know
that
they
ever
have?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
you're
not
aware
if
they
ever
have?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
is
there
an
indication
they
ever
considered
any
arbitration
matter?
unknown
speaker
are
you
aware,
and
you
are
their
lawyer--
unknown
speaker
--of
any
instance
in
which
any
case
involving
arbitration
was
decided
by
this
particular
court?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
are
you
aware
of
any
instance
in
which
any...
i'm
doing
a
little
cross
examination.
unknown
speaker
what
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
is
why
would
a
contractor
sign
a
contract
to
go
to
a
court
that's
never
even
heard
of
our...
i
mean,
never
even
considered
any
arbitration
matter.
i
mean,
i'm
trying
to
construe
these
words
in
any
court.
and
you
said
they
mean
any
tribal
court.
and
after
all,
contractors
are
in
business.
they're
businesspeople.
if
they
want
to
deal
with
arbitration,
it
seems
highly
unlikely
that
that's
what
they
would
have
meant
or
what
anybody
would
have
meant.
now,
what's
the
response
to
that?
because
i
mean
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
a
response
to.
this
seems
so
unlikely,
your
interpretation,
and
i
want
a
response
to
it.
i
would
agree
with
justice
breyer's
perplexity
if
it
were
clear
to
me
that
tribes
say
that
they
consent
to
jurisdiction
in
tribal
court.
this
is
the
first
time
i've
understood
that.
is
it
your
position
that
you
consent
that
you
waive
immunity
in
tribal
court?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
don't
think
it
means
tribal
court?
i
didn't
understand
your
answer
to
justice
breyer.
you
don't
think
it
even
mean
tribal
court,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
you
think
it
means
any
court
that
you
can
get
me
in
without
this
agreement,
which
doesn't
include
any
tribal
court.
unknown
speaker
is
it
a
court
on
the
moon?
i
mean,
what
is...
there
are
only
to
my
knowledge
tribal
courts,
federal
courts,
state
courts,
what
else
is
there?
unknown
speaker
but,
you
say
no
court
has
jurisdiction
because
this
isn't
a
waiver
of
tribal
immunity.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
your
position
was
no
court
had
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
you're
on
the
moon.
unknown
speaker
so,
the
tribe
in
effect
has
asked
the
contractor
to
use
a
term
which
in
fact
is
totally
meaningless,
utterly
misleading,
and
apparently
an
act
of
intentional
bad
faith.
isn't
that
the
consequence
of
your
position?
unknown
speaker
it
means
any
court
having
jurisdiction.
a-ha,
there
isn't
one
of
those.
too
bad.
we
didn't
mention
that.
that
seems
to
be
the
argument.
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt
you
with
this
question?
we
had
a
case
a
couple
weeks
ago
and
it
rose
out
of
california
contracting
and
problems
with
that.
suppose
california
had
this
clause
as
a
standard
part
of
all
its
government
contracts,
all
its
procurement
contracts.
would
it
be
enforceable
or
not?
unknown
speaker
precisely
the
same
language
we
have
before
us
and
they
agreed
to
arbitration,
the
american
arbitration
association,
and
all
the
rest.
would
that
be
an
unenforceable
or
an
enforceable
agreement
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
it
would?
even
if
they
did,
in
all
their
contracts,
they
said
this
precise
thing?
unknown
speaker
this
is
standard
boiler...
we're
using
your
term,
it's
boiler
plate.
they
use
it
in
all
their
contracts.
unknown
speaker
if
it
is
created
by
the--
unknown
speaker
--well,
they're
the
ones
who
tender
the
contract
just
like
your
client
did.
is
it
enforceable
against
the
state
or
not
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not,
i
have
not
seen.
i
have
never
seen...
you
say
any
government
other
than
an
indian
tribe
government
could
make
this
argument.
i
have
only
been
here
a
limited
time,
but
i
have
never
seen
a
state
government
make
this
argument.
i
thought
that
state
governments
would
argue
the
words
in
any
court
in
our
contract
mean
in
any
state
court.
and
of
course,
the
state
courts
are
open.
they
have
waived
immunity
in
those
courts.
it's
a
perfectly
plausible
alternative
forum.
i've
never...
and
so,
if
there
is
some
case
where
it
is
different
between
the
tribal
government
and
the
state
government,
i'd
like
to
know
what
that
is
because
my
impression
is
it's
the
same.
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
i'll
look
at
that.
i
was
just
saying
that.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
minnis,
the
picture
here
is
that
a
tribe
selects
out
a
certain
form
contract
to
present
to
the
other
side.
and
as
i
understood
the
way
this
thing
unfolded,
it
wasn't
simply
the
enforcement
in
court.
the
tribe
stayed
out
of
the
arbitration
forum
too,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so,
it
gave
the
other
side
a
piece
of
paper
that
says
arbitration
and
the
whole
thing
was
a
deception.
it
was
illusory?
unknown
speaker
there
is
also
a
rule,
isn't
there,
in
most
common-law
jurisdictions
that
parties
deal
in
good
faith
with
one
another
and
don't
pretend
something,
which
is
just
illusory
as
you
interpret
this
contract
to
be?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just
thought
i--
unknown
speaker
--just
deceptive
you
said.
is
that
your
answer
to
judge--
unknown
speaker
--wasn't
that
your
answer?
unknown
speaker
just
a
minute.
unknown
speaker
i'm
asking
you
what
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg
was,
whether
you
didn't
agree
whether
it
was
a
deceptive
contract?
unknown
speaker
so,
the
tribe
brings
this
contract
to
the
contractor.
it
says
they
agree
to
arbitration
in
any
court
having
jurisdiction,
but
it
really
doesn't
grant
anything
that
way.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
that
just
restates
the
proposition
of
what
the
law
is
and
brings
us
right
back
to
where
we
started.
let
me
ask
you
this.
for
this
party,
this
contractor,
are
there
any
claims
procedures
by
which
he
can
request
payment?
suppose
he
built
the
building
and
the
tribe
just
didn't
pay?
unknown
speaker
there
are
no...
would
he
go
to
the
tribal
council
and
ask
for
a
special
private
bill
to
get
paid?
i
mean,
is
that
the
way
it
works?
unknown
speaker
i'm
asking
what
alternative
remedies
there
are
if
you
contract
with
this
tribe
and
you've
got
this
language
in
it
and
the
tribe
says
it
means
that
you
can't
sue.
unknown
speaker
but,
you
do--
--don't
other
states
have
the
possibility
of
pursuing
private
bills,
of
pursuing--
unknown
speaker
--pursuing--
unknown
speaker
--pursuing
administrative
claims
adjudication?
unknown
speaker
and
i'm
asking
if
any
of
those
procedures
have
ever
been...
exist
with
the
tribe
or
have
ever
been
pursued
by
other
contracting
parties?
unknown
speaker
justice
scalia,
did
you
have
a
question?
i
was
um,
you
know,
it
doesn't
matter.
pardon?
thank
you,
mr.
minnis.
unknown
speaker
mr.
garre,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
authority
for
that,
mr.
garre?
was
that
said
in
the
kiowa
case?
unknown
speaker
that
was
just
dicta
in
santa
clara,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but,
you
think
clear
waiver
necessarily
means
the
same
standards
that
are
required
for
a
waiver
by
a
state
under
the
eleventh
amendment?
unknown
speaker
but,
what's
unequivocal?
it
may
mean
something
different
when
you're
talking
about
a
state
court
and
when
you're
talking
about
a
tribal
court.
for
instance,
if
i
read
this
clause
about,
you
know,
you
can
bring
suit
in
any
court
having
jurisdiction
thereof,
if
the
tribe
were
taking
the
more
limited
position,
which
i
gather
the
united
states
is,
that
this
was
at
least
an
agreement
to
suit
in
the
tribal
court.
okay.
if
i
had
this
agreement
with
a
state,
i
would
think
that
it
might
be
limited
to
just
the
state
court.
but,
if
i
entered
into
this
agreement
with
a
tribe
with
respect
to
real
estate
off
of
the
tribal
reservation,
the
notion
of
a
tribal
court
just
wouldn't
enter
into
my
mind
when
it
spoke
about
in
accordance
with
applicable
law
in
any
court
having
jurisdiction
thereof.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
what's
unequivocal
depends
on
what
you
have
in
your...
maybe
i'm
not
enough
of
a
westerner.
i
don't
know.
but,
a
tribal
court
wouldn't
occur
to
me.
unknown
speaker
no.
i'm
assuming
they
exist.
but,
i'm
still
saying
the
reasonable
import
of
that
language,
the
unequivocal
import
of
that
language
with
regard
to
a
state
might
well
be
that
you
can
only
bring
suit
in
the
state
court.
i
am
not
sure
that
it
would
be
the
same
when
you're
dealing
with
a
tribe
simply
because
who
thinks
of
any
court
having
jurisdiction
thereof
as
a
tribal
court.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
doesn't
that
presumption
operate
in
circumstances
in
which
the
state
is
making
agreements
in
the
state
context.
the
state
is
making
agreements
for
work
to
be
done
in
the
state.
and
if
here
the
agreement
were
for
work
to
be
done
on
the
reservation,
you
would
have
a
stronger
argument.
but,
here
the
agreement
is
for
work
to
be
done
outside
the
reservation
on
non-indian
lands.
and
doesn't
that
bring
us
back
to
what
justice
scalia
said?
that
if
you've
got
a
contract
within
its
four
corners
makes
it
clear
that
you're
contracting
about
work
to
be
done
outside
the
reservation.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
have
the
implication
that
it's
a
waiver
only
as
to
tribal
courts.
unknown
speaker
you
know,
but
it's
the...
but
the
question
is
what
does
unequivocal
mean
here?
what
is
clear
here?
and
it
seems
to
me
that
what
is
clear
here
will
perhaps
vary
depending
on
whether
the
subject
matter
of
the
contract
is
subject
matter
on
reservation
or
off
reservation.
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
it
a
sensible
distinction
to
draw?
in
other
words,
we're
trying
to
find
meaning
here.
unknown
speaker
but,
it
also
might
be
helpful,
at
least
to
me
i
would
think,
if
any
tribe
is
supposed
to
be
tribal
court.
i
would
like
to
know.
do
tribal
courts
normally
handle
arbitration
matters
or
don't
they?
you
represent
the
interior
department.
i
would
imagine
that
they
must
have
discussed
this
with
you.
so,
are
there
normally
arbitration
matters
in
tribal
courts
or
are
there
not?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
but,
that
isn't
a
matter
of
the
record.
it's
a
matter
of
what
the
interior
department
and
the
government
would
represent.
unknown
speaker
but,
this
contract
does
refer
to
application
of
the
rules
of
the
american
arbitration
association
and
it
makes
some
reference
to
the
state
act.
both
of
those
in
turn
refer
to
at
least
state
court
and
in
the
american
arbitration
association
to
state
or
federal
court.
now,
why
isn't
that
part
and
parcel
of
the
contract
then?
we
know
what
it
referred
to.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
so.
no.
it
refers
to
it
within
the
contract
itself.
it
asked
the
parties.
the
parties
agreed
that's
what's
going
to
be
binding.
unknown
speaker
just
on
this
whole
issue,
you're
arguing
that
this
might
be
in
tribal
court.
but,
the
tribe
represented
to
us
12
minutes
ago
that
it
was
not
waiving
its
immunity
in
a
tribal
court.
so,
this
is
just
a
red
herring
that
you're
entered
into
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
yes.
but,
didn't
the
agreement
incorporate
the
rules
of
the
american
arbitration
association
which
refer
to
federal
or
state
court
and
don't
mention
indian
tribal
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
couldn't
you
say
it
provided
for
arbitration
in
oklahoma
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
could
be
brought
in
any
court
of
competent
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
first
i
thought
that
in
winning
this
case,
the
tribes
would
lose
the
war
because
they'd
have
an
awfully
hard
time
getting
people
to
contract
with
them.
in
general,
what
contractors
will
go
into
this
kind
of
thing
with
your
fine
spun
arguments
being
used
against
them?
unknown
speaker
so,
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
garre.
mr.
mashburn,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
