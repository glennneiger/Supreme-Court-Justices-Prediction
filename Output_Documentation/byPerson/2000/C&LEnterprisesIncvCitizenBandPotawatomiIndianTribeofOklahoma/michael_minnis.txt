mr.
michael
minnis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
an
arbitration
clause
is
just
that,
it's
an
arbitration
clause.
it
is
not
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
and
it's
certainly
not
one
by
the
standards
that
this
court
has
adopted,
which
is
clear
and
unequivocal.
mr.
michael
minnis
no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
minnis
this
language,
as
we
pointed
out
before,
is
boiler
plate
language
in
an
agreement,
a
standard
form
agreement
between
private
parties.
the
language
there
in
the
arbitration
clause
is
merely,
closes
the
loop.
the
first
part
of
the
loop
is
we're
waiving
in
an
arbitration
clause
our
right
to
go
in
and
have
a
jury
trial
on
the
issue
of
who
has
got
the
damages.
any
contract
is
presumably
enforceable
in
any
court
having
jurisdiction
thereof.
all
this
does
is
close
the
loop
and
say
once
your
arbitration
agreement,
once
you
have
your
arbitration
award,
it
can
be
enforced
in
a
court
of,
any
court
having
jurisdiction.
mr.
michael
minnis
just
like
the
contract
could
have.
mr.
michael
minnis
in
the...
you
mean
in
the
language
of
the
courts
in
the
cases
that
said
any
court
of
competent
jurisdiction?
mr.
michael
minnis
i
think
it's
just
the
same
thing.
i
think
it's
said
in
a
different
way.
i
do
not
agree
with
the
justice
that
the
language
is
interpreted.
you
have
to
go
in
and
construe
it
as
you
did
when
you
announced
it.
i
think
this
is
boiler
plate
language.
it
simply
made
it
clear--
mr.
michael
minnis
--well,
because
it
has...
what
it
has
to
do
with
is
the
intention
of
the
parties
to
waive
sovereign
immunity.
and
if
it's
a
contract,
it's
not
a
contract
tailored
any
way
for
a
government,
or
any
way
for
an
indian
tribe,
you're
reading
it
and
it
seems
like
a
party--
mr.
michael
minnis
--well,
your
honor,
let
me
cite
from...
i
mean,
mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
cite
from
mastrobuono
v
shearson
lehman
hutton,
514
u.s.
52
at
63
where
this
court
was
construing
an
arbitration
clause
that
spoke
about,
that
specifically
said
new
york
law
will
be
controlling
in
new
york
law.
and
that
instance
allowed
punitive
damages.
the
suit
was
brought
in
pennsylvania
and
they
said
new
york
law
doesn't...
this
is
going
to
be
construed
under
new
york
law,
therefore
you
cannot
get
punitive
damages.
and
this
court
said,
as
a
practical
matter,
it
seems
unlikely
that
petitioners
were
actually
aware
of
new
york's
bifurcated
approach
to
punitive
damages
or
that
they
had
any
idea
that
by
signing
a
standard
form
agreement
to
arbitrate
disputes
they
might
be
giving
up
an
important
substantive
right.
mr.
michael
minnis
pardon?
mr.
michael
minnis
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
minnis
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
minnis
under
the
circumstances,
no,
i
do
not
think
it
makes
any
difference.
mr.
michael
minnis
it
could
include
a
tribal
court.
mr.
michael
minnis
pardon?
mr.
michael
minnis
federal
court,
state
court,
any
court
that's
out
there.
mr.
michael
minnis
no,
but
your
honor,
it
didn't
say
that.
and
i--
mr.
michael
minnis
--it
could
mean
that,
yes.
mr.
michael
minnis
well,
i
don't
want
to
divine
the
intention
of
a
party--
mr.
michael
minnis
--right.
mr.
michael
minnis
tribal
court.
mr.
michael
minnis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
minnis
i
am
not
sure
whether
they
have.
i
am
not
aware
if
they
have.
mr.
michael
minnis
no.
mr.
michael
minnis
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
minnis
they
are
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction.
so,
they
could
consider
any
case.
mr.
michael
minnis
yes.
mr.
michael
minnis
i
am
not
aware.
mr.
michael
minnis
i
understand.
mr.
michael
minnis
no.
mr.
michael
minnis
well,
i...
what
i
tried
to--
mr.
michael
minnis
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
minnis
there
are
any
courts
that
have
jurisdiction.
it
begs
the
questions
which
court
has--
mr.
michael
minnis
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
minnis
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
minnis
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
minnis
no,
your
honor.
the...
every--
mr.
michael
minnis
--that
is
the
argument,
your
honor.
but,
it's
the
argument
any
party
that
contracts
with
any
government,
except
perhaps
an
indian
government--
mr.
michael
minnis
--if
california
had
as
part
of
their--
mr.
michael
minnis
--in
my
view,
it
would
be
unenforceable.
mr.
michael
minnis
well,
it--
mr.
michael
minnis
--right.
it's
boiler
plate
created
contracts
created
by
them,
not
boiler
plated
in
a
contract
copyrighted
by
the--
mr.
michael
minnis
--by
the
american
arbitration
association.
mr.
michael
minnis
in
my
view,
it
would
not
be.
and
my
view
is
that
an
arbitration
clause
is
not
a
waiver
under
any...
of
any
sovereign
immunity
except,
as
counsel
is
arguing
here,
if
the
party
that
is
involved
happens
to
be
an
indian
tribe.
mr.
michael
minnis
well,
maybe
i'm
deviating
from
the
focus
of
your
question.
but,
we've
cited
prepay...
florida
prepay
where
they
discussed
that
the
state
does
not
consent
to
suit
unless...
in
their
own
courts
unless
they
specifically
say
it
even
though
they
have
that
language.
and
so,
i
don't
understand
how
they
could--
mr.
michael
minnis
--well,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
minnis
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
minnis
well,
it
is
a
deception
in
terms
of
a
party
who
is
not...
if
you
say
that
the
parties
aren't
charged
to
know
the
law,
which
in
oklahoma
they
are.
and
the
law
is
that
you
have
to
have
a
waiver
by
the
tribal
government
or
the
state
government.
it's
not
deceptive.
mr.
michael
minnis
well,
i
don't
interpret
this
contract
as
illusory.
mr.
michael
minnis
i
interpret
this--
mr.
michael
minnis
--well--
mr.
michael
minnis
--i
interpret--
mr.
michael
minnis
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
minnis
i
don't
believe
it's
a
deceptive
contract
as
a
matter
of
law
because
everyone
is
chargeable
with
knowledge
of
the
law,
which
are
that
indian
tribes
have
sovereign
immunity
and
unless
they
waive
it.
and
they
don't
have
a
clear
and
unequivocal
waiver
here
and
therefore--
mr.
michael
minnis
--absent
from
something
from
the
tribe,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i'd
like
to
quote...
the
same
thing
is
true
of
any
municipality
in
terms
of
the
authority.
here
is
nottingham
v.
city
of
yukon,
766
pacific
2nd
973,
at
975,
976.
in
this
case,
a
city
manager
had
compromised
the
claim.
he
said
that's
deceptive
because
the
city
manager
didn't
have
authority.
here's
what
oklahoma
said,
"the
yukon
city
manager
acted
in
excess
of
his
statutory
authority
by
attempting
to
settling
compromise
or
wrongful
demotion
claim.
"
and
then
the
court
said
whoever
contracts
with
a
municipality
does
so
with
notice
under
limitation
on
its
or
its
agents
powers.
everyone
is
presumed
to
know
the
law
and
whoever
contracts
with
such
a
municipality
or
furnishes
supplies
does
so
with
reference
to
the
law.
if
such
persons
go
beyond
the
limitations
imposed,
they
do
so
at
their
own--
mr.
michael
minnis
--if
he
built
the
building
and
the
tribe
didn't
pay,
then,
no,
there
would
be...
it's
just
like--
mr.
michael
minnis
--they
could,
but
that
of
course
is
not
the
situation
here.
nothing
happened
here.
but,
you're
talking--
mr.
michael
minnis
--there
is
no
alternative
remedy.
when
you
deal
with
a
sovereign,
you
get
the
sovereign
to
waive
the
immunity
and
you
get
the
sovereign
to
do
it
as
is
provided
for
in
its
own
laws
or
you
don't
have
the
waiver.
mr.
michael
minnis
oh
yes.
mr.
michael
minnis
yes.
mr.
michael
minnis
yes.
mr.
michael
minnis
i
don't
know
any
other
contracting
party
that
i
can
think
of
right
now
who's
ever
had
a
problem
getting
paid
for
doing
work
that
they
performed
for
the
tribe.
i
don't
know
that
it's
a
situation
that's
ever
arisen.
mr.
michael
minnis
thank
you.
