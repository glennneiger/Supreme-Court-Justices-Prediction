mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
kiowa
tribe,
this
court
recognized
that
indian
tribes
enjoy
sovereign
immunity
from
suit
in
state
courts
with
respect
to
both
the
governmental
and
commercial
activities.
in
deciding
whether
a
tribe
has
waived
that
immunity,
this
court
applies
the
same
stringent
standard
that
is
applied...
that
it
applies
in
determining
whether
a
state,
or
the
united
states,
has
waived
its
immunity
from
suit.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
certainly
this
court
in
the
santa
clara
pueblo
case--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
court
said
that
the
test
was
unequivocal
expression.
and
the
court
has
in
the
potawatomi
case
said
the
test
was
a
clear
waiver
which
certainly
we
view
as
being
the
same
as
an
unequivocal
waiver.
and
the
court
even
in
the
kiowa
case
cited
santa
clara
pueblo
with
approval.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
we
certainly
don't
mean
that
unequivocal
means
one
thing
for
a
state
and
one
thing
for
a
tribe.
the
court
has
expressed
the
standard
as
unequivocal
expression
and
the
merrion
v.
jicarilla
apache
tribe,
the
court
addressed
the
question
of
whether
because
indian
tribes
had
different
attributes
of
their
sovereignty
than
the
states,
or
the
united
states,
a
different
waiver
standard
ought
to
apply.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
that
sort
of
interpretation
i
think
goes
beyond
the
four
corners
of
the
document
that
the
court
would
be
construing.
and
this
court
in
finding
unequivocal
waivers
has
always
limited
its
analysis
to
the
language
of
the
statute
of
contract.
here,
that
would
be
applying
an
understanding
or
a
belief
about
the
availability
of
jurisdiction
in
tribal
court,
about
whether
tribal
courts
exist.
and
that,
we
don't
know
from
the
record
in
the
case.
and
that
i'm
not
sure
it'd
be
reasonable
in
the
case--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--but,
the
court
of
course
has
said
that
in
the
context
of
the
state
in
the
kennecott
copper
case
and
in
the
college
savings
case.
and
we
think
that
that
makes
sense
as
a
rule
of
construction,
that
a
sovereign
as
a
presumption
would
only
intend
to
consent
to
suit
if
it
were
going
to
consent
to
suit
in
its
own
courts
and
not
another
sovereign's
courts.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
of
course--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
we
don't
believe
that
it
does.
because
the
court
has
held
squarely
and
most
recently
in
kiowa
tribe
that
the
on
the
reservation...
off
the
reservation
distinction
doesn't
work
for
purposes
of
tribal
sovereign
immunity.
this
contract
was
entered
into
with
the
tribe.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
but,
we
don't
think
that
the
court
has
drawn
that
distinction
or
should
draw
that
distinction
in
this
case.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
contractor...
the
contract
was
entered
into
with
the
tribe.
the
fact
that
the
particular
property
underlying
this
contract
was
not
on
the
reservation
doesn't
add
or
subtract
any
ambiguity
from
the
language
that's
in
there,
which
is
again
any
court
having
jurisdiction
language.
it
doesn't
answer
the
ambiguity
that
this
court
identified
in
kennecott
copper--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
record
in
this
case
doesn't
reflect
that.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i'm
not
prepared
to
make
a
representation
on
that.
it
is
clear,
however,
that
this
court
and
congress
has
recognized
that
tribal
courts
are
perfectly
competent
and
capable
of
adjudicating
important
personal
and
property
rights.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
of
course,
it
would
require
the
court
to
go
beyond
the
contract
to
interpret
it,
which
is--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
contract
provides
that
arbitration
shall
be
in
accordance
with
the
rules.
if
that's
all
that
were
here,
then
the
separate
arbitration
enforcement
provision
would
not
be
necessary.
and
moreover,
whatever
ambiguity
that
is
resolved
by
the
fact
that
the
rules
provide
for
jurisdiction
in
a
federal
or
state
court,
the
fact
that
the
contract
omits
that
language
simply
reintroduces
the
ambiguity
back
into
it.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we
don't
think
so.
we
believe
that
the
party's
intent
should
be
determined
from
the
language
in
the
contract
as
in
any
other
contract
case.
and
in
reviewing
this
language,
we
believe
that
the
language
does
not
unequivocally
express
the
tribe's--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--as
i
said,
the
agreement
says
arbitration
shall
be
in
accordance
with
that.
there
would
be
no
need
for
the
separate
enforcement
provision
of
the
clause
if
the
reference...
if
the
parties
thought
that
the
reference
to
the
rules
alone
resolved
that.
and
the
fact
that
the
contract
doesn't
contain
the
federal
or
state
court
limitation
that's
in
the
rules
simply
introduces
ambiguity
as
to
whether
the
parties
intentionally
omitted
that.
now,
with
respect
to
the
choice
of
law
provision,
we
don't
think
that
the
separate
choice
of
law
provision
itself
can
unequivocally
express
the
tribe's
consent
to
suit
in
state
court.
and
moreover,
the
oklahoma
uniform
arbitration
act
by
its
terms
is
inapplicable
to
the
contract
in
this
case
because
that
act
only
applies
to
agreements
which
provide
for
arbitration
in
this
state.
and
the
agreement
in
this
case
did
not
provide
for
arbitration
in
oklahoma.
so,
that
act
doesn't
apply.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
that
gets
back
to
the
question
of
what
courts
would
have
competent
jurisdiction.
but,
it
is...
given
the
plain
meaning
to
the
language,
providing
for
jurisdiction
in
this
state
we
think
that
the
conflict...
that
the
law
requires
that
the
arbitration
contract
provide
for
arbitration
in
oklahoma.
that's
not
uncommon
in
this
context.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
some
tribes--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--some
tribes,
like
some
states,
and
the
united
states
after
80
years
of
its
existence,
have
decided
to
waive
immunity
from
suit
in
breach
of
contract
actions.
the
navajo
nation
has
done
that
in
its
laws.
each
tribe
will
have
to
make
that
determination
in
whether
or
not
to
waive
its
immunity
from
suit
in
any
given
case.
in
kiowa
tribe,
this
court
recognized
that
congress
was
in
the
best
position
to
weigh
the
competing
policy
concerns
and
reliance
interests
in
this
area.
the
court
has
consistently
recognized
the
unequivocal
expression
standard.
we
don't
think
that
unequivocal
should
mean
one
thing
in
the
case
of
the
states,
which
even
here
today
has
acknowledged
this
type
of
language
would
not
waive
their
immunity
from
suit
in
federal
court
and
should
mean
another
thing
for
the
tribes.
