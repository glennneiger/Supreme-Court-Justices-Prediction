justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
clarify
one
thing
in
my
own
mind
about
your
position?
i
understand
if
the
prisoner
files
a
case
in
which
he
just
asks
for
damages
and
nothing
else,
it's
accusing
a
guard
of
beating
him
up
on
a
particular
occasion.
you'd
say
he
must
exhaust
and
maybe
you
can
satisfy
him
by
transferring
the
guard
or
moving
or
something
like
that,
but
supposing
the
guard
is
dead
and
there's
nothing
that
could
be
done
to
remedy
a
situation
except
money
damage,
do
you
still
say
he
should
exhaust?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
why
again
in
that
hypothetical?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
give
me
an
example
of
this.
my
hypothetical
is
he
sues
because
he
was
assaulted
by
a
guard
who
since
died
and
nothing
else
he
wants
but
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
could
the
prison
give
him
that
would
help
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
suggesting
there's
sort
of
an
undefined
category
of
relief
that
might
be
granted
by
the
warden
independently,
not
as
a
result
of
a
particular
proceeding
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
my
hypo
was
the
dead
guard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
say
well
they
might
give
him
a
different
cell
or
they
might
give
him
library
privileges
or
something
like
that,
but
if
none
of
that
is
prescribed
in
the
procedure,
that
is,
you
know,
the
prison
disciplinary
remedy
procedure,
can
you
still
say
that's
a
part
of
the
available
remedies?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
the
procedure
has
a
limited
set
of
remedies
that
it
does
authorize.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
you're
still
saying,
but
that
still
would
not
be
exhaustive.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just,
so
i'll
be
sure
i
have
time
to
get
your
answer.
what
if
the
system
doesn't
provide
any
relief
at
all
for
the
particular
grievances
in
my
example?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would.
so
you
would
just
agree
with
the
state
on
that
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
interpretation
of
the
word
remedy
is
more
than
process
then,
it's
some
relief.
