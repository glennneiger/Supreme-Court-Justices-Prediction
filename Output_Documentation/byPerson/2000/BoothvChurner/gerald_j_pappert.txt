mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
plra,
congress
changed
the
exhaustion
scheme
that
it
had
previously
imposed
upon
prisoners
because
it
had
not
worked.
it
had
not
controlled
the
explosive
growth
in
prisoner
litigation.
congress
amended
the
scheme
by
deleting
the
requirements
that
the
administrative
remedies
be
plain,
speedy
or
effective
and
by
withdrawing
from
the
courts
the
discretion
to
determine
whether
or
not
exhaustion
is
required.
in
light
of
these
changes,
it
is
clear
that
congress
wants
prisoners
to
exhaust
their
prison
administrative
processes
whether
or
not
those
processes
can
provide
the
prisoner
the
relief
he
or
she
says
they
need.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
your
definition
of
available,
your
honor,
is
ours.
if
the
prison
will
in
any
way
accept
the
prisoner's
complaint
and
address
it.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
what
it
means,
your
honor,
is
what
congress
wanted
and
that
is
that
there
is
a
presumption
that
underlies,
i
think,
the
petitioner's
point
and
your
initial
question,
which
is
that,
just
because
money's
not
available
there
is
nothing
that
this
process
can
do
for
the
prisoner.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
well,
remedy
in
this
statute
means
process,
your
honor.
congress
wanted
the
inmates
to
exhaust
their
administrative
process.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
no,
it
doesn't.
no,
it
doesn't,
your
honor.
and
where
i
respectfully
differ
with
your
question
is
again
the
presumption
that
it
means
nothing.
the
process
means
nothing
if
there
isn't
money
at
the
end
of
the
line
and
the
reason
that
that
is
not
correct
is
that
there
is
an
indefinite
and
almost
endless
list
of
ways
that
the
prison
could
satisfy
the
prisoner,
short
of
money.
there
is
always
a
possibility
that
the
prison
can
satisfy
the
prisoner
short
of
giving
him
or
her
money
because
in
essence
the
currency
equivalence
isn't
money.
money
has
a
value
within
the
prisons,
but
the
currency
of
prisons
is
in-kind
relief.
and
there
are
many
things
within
a
prison
that
money
can't
buy
and
that
are
very
valuable
to
the
prisoner.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
you
would
still
need
the
statute.
again
because
congress
wanted
as
many
of
these
claims
going
through
the
administrative
process
as
possible
because
they
wanted
as
few--
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
--he
says
he
doesn't
want
to
go
through
it,
your
honor,
but
again
i
think
we
make
a
mistake
to
equate
what
the
prisoner
says
he
wants
or
needs
when
he
files
a
grievance,
with
what
the
prisoner
says
he
wants
once
he
files
his
civil
rights
complaint.
and
the
entire
premise
upon
which
the
petitioner's
interpretation
is
based
is
that
there's
absolutely
nothing
the
process
can
do
for
him
and
that's
simply
not
true.
there
are
many
things
the
process
can
do
for
him,
but
your
honor,
in
your
hypothetical
if
the
prisoner
goes
through
the
process,
if
he
doesn't
accept
any
of
the
various
forms
of
relief
that
he's
offered,
if
his
allegations,
of
course,
are
found
to
be
true
by
the
prison,
he
can
still
go
to
court.
we
have
no
problem
with
that.
this
is
just
a
mechanism
to
try
to
weed
as
many
of
the
court
claims
out
as
possible.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
statute
of
limitations
claim
may
start
to
run
earlier
and
if
it
does,
that
is
just
something
that
congress
took
into
mind
when
it
imposed
no
doubt
a
dramatic
difference
in
how
they
wanted
prisoner
litigation
handled.
such
that,
you
know,
as
long
as
he
goes
through
the
process,
he
conceivably
can
still
file
a
federal
court
claim.
the
administrative
process
will
be
over
with
in
most
cases
before
a
statute
of
limitations
on
an
underlying
claim--
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
--your
honor,
i
agree
with
part
of
your
question
and
respectfully
disagree
with
the
second
part.
there
may
be
an
instance
where
there
is
a
harsh
result
following
the
prison
process
and
if
the
statute
of
limitation
expires
it's
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all
being
that
congress
wanted
to
leave
the
setting
of
the
deadlines
to
the
discretion
of
the
states
and
the
departments
of
corrections
and
the
local
institutions.
so--
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
--well,
the
rationale
is,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
the
second
part
of
your
prior
question
ties
into
my
answer
to
this
question.
that
was,
you
indicated
that
the
prison
could
in
effect
drag
the
process
out.
we
would
not
agree
with
that.
and
we
would
say
that
if
the
administrative
process
is
not
honored
by
the
prison,
the
prisoner
will
still
have
a
remedy.
we
are
not
saying
that
courts
do
not
have
the
discretion
under
this
statute
to
determine
whether
exhaustion
has,
in
fact,
taken
place.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
well,
the
idea
of
exhaustion
of
remedies,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
to
prevent
having
to
go
to
court,
as
congress
wanted
this
statute
to
work.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
yes
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
i
wouldn't
assume
that,
your
honor,
and
that
was
the
point
i
was
leading
to.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
right.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
i
was
honestly
trying
to
get
to
that,
your
honor,
and
that
is,
that
that's
my
point
behind
the
fact
that
courts
do
not
lose
the
discretion
here
to
determine
whether
exhaustion
has
taken
place,
which
means
that
the
prisoner's
put
in
the
position
that
justice
ginsburg
referred
to
and
for
no
good
reason
that
the
prison
simply
dragged
out
the
process.
the
prisoner
can
still--
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
--we
believe
that
the
prisoner
could
make
an
equitable
tolling
argument
at
the
appropriate
time,
yes,
your
honor.
but
another
point
here
though
is
that,
under
the
petitioner's
interpretation,
we
still
have
the
problem
justice
ginsburg
referred
to.
if
there's
a
short
deadline
for
the
bringing
of
the
claim
to
the
administrative
process,
whether
or
not
there's
relief
at
the
end
of
the
line
that
the
petitioner
wants,
they
still
may
have
that
very
situation.
so
the
petitioner's
interpretation
of
the
statute
doesn't
satisfy
some
of
the
problems
that
could
come.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
that
was
in
the
context,
your
honor,
of
what
i
thought
was
justice
ginsburg's
hypo
of
the
prison
unreasonably
dragging
out
the
process
for
the
purposes
of
blowing
the
statute
of
limitations.
and
what
i
was
saying
in
response
to
that
is,
that
in
situations
like
that,
we
would
determine
that
exhaustion...
we
would
feel
that
exhaustion
has
taken
place
if,
for
example,
the
prisoner
submits
his
claim,
the
prison
sits
on
it,
they
do
not
honor
their
deadlines
under
the
exhaustion
process.
exhaustion
has
taken
place
under
that
and
what
i
am
saying
is
there's
no
prohibition
on
a
court
recognizing
that.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
in
pennsylvania
under
these
facts,
it
would
be
two
years,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
well,
if
the
deadlines
in
this
process
are
honored
by
pennsylvania,
the
process
would
take
on
average
probably
under
90
days,
your
honor.
if
the
deadlines
have
not
been
honored
and
the
prison
has,
in
effect,
sat
on
the
grievance,
the
prisoner
would
have
a
remedy,
yes.
the
petitioner's
interpretation
of
the
statute
i
think
most
importantly
would
reintroduce
the
effectiveness
requirement
that
came
out
in
some
prior
questions.
and
it
would
also
allow
the
prisoner
to
bypass
the
process
simply
by
manipulating
the
relief
that
he
requests.
and
there's
no
better
example
of
that,
i
think
in
response
to
a
question,
we
heard
that
it's
not
just
money.
money
might
not
be
the
only
issue
and
we
get
to
the
questions
of
the
caps
and
that
is
that
next
time
it
may
be
that
the
prisoner
wants
the
prison
regulations
be
declared
unconstitutional.
and
he
says
that
you
can't
declare
it
unconstitutional,
prison,
so
i
have
to
go
the
federal
courts.
there
will
be
different
ways
to
evade
the
process
other
than
by
saying
that
money
is
all
that
the
prisoner
really
wants
and
that
is
a
risk
here.
and
that,
in
fact,
happened
in
one
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
petitioner
in
the
fifth
circuit
where
the
prisoner
filed
a
mixed
claim,
as
in
some
of
the
prior
questions,
the
magistrate
recommended
dismissal
of
the
claim
based
on
failure
to
exhaust.
the
prisoner
quickly
amended
his
claim
and
made
it
solely
a
money
damages
case
and
the
fifth
circuit
allowed
that.
i
mean,
that's
a
clear
example
of
empirical
evidence
of
how
a
prisoner
got
around
the
exhaustion
requirement
and
that
we
know
is
contrary
to
what
congress
wanted
in
this
statute.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
yes,
your
honor,
and
that's...
it
is.
under
the
pennsylvania
process
it's
almost
as
though
a
provision
tries
to
foster
use
of
the
grievance
process
by
putting
it
into
the
context
of
settlement
negotiations.
we
were
not
speaking
in
terms
of
a
factual
record
as
a
lower
court
would
deliver
to
an
appellate
court.
but
what
we
meant
there
was
there
can
still
be
an
investigation.
there
can
be
the
gathering
and
preservation
of
evidence
by
the
prison,
all
of
which
can
narrow
the
claims
that
do
make
it
to
court
and
that's
what
we
meant
by
the
value
in
a
record
sense
of
exhausting
the
process.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
your
honor
because--
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
--in
that
hypo,
even
though
there
could
be
no
action
taken
against
the
guard,
there
could
still
be
something
that
the
prison
could
give
the
prisoner
that
would
satisfy
him.
the
problem
with
the
petitioner's
interpretation
of
the
statute
is,
we
will
never
know
that.
we
don't
know
that
in
this
case
before
the
claim
gets
to
federal
courts
and
we
will
not
know
that
in
all
the
cases
that
are
similar
to
this
that
follow
because
we
never
gave
the
prison
the
chance
to
try.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
yes.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
the
types
of
relief
that
they
could
try
to
satisfy
him
with,
your
honor,
again,
could
be
one
of
any...
a
single...
a
better
cell
assignment,
a
single
cell,
extra
privileges.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
your
honor,
there
are...
yes,
your
honor,
and
i'll
assume
under
your
question
that
there's
absolutely
nothing
the
prison
can
do
for
that
prisoner.
congress
focused
more
broadly
in
this
statute
and
there
still
things
that
can
benefit
the
other
inmates
who
remain
at
the
prison
and
the
prison
itself
by
putting
the
prison
on
notice
of
the
problem
and
giving
the
prison
the
first
opportunity
to
correct
it.
so
those
are
benefits
that
can
flow
generally
from
exhaustion
of
the
process.
even
though
under
your
question,
your
honor,
that
particular
prisoner
was
not
satisfied.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
well,
again,
our--
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
--well,
we
define
remedy
as
process,
your
honor.
remedy
is
not
relief--
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
--under
this
statute.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
the
words
are
used
interchangeably
in
the
statute
and
when
we
do
speak
of
exhaustion
of
remedies
we
don't,
as
i
believe
justice
souter
pointed
out,
we
don't
speak
of
exhaustion
of
the
money
or
the
injunctive
relief,
we
speak
of
exhaustion
of
the
process.
so
i
would
respectfully
differ
with
you
there,
but
again
even
in
your
question--
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
--yes.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
what
you're
referring
to,
justice
stevens.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
yeah,
oh,
okay.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
yes,
your
honor.
the
procedure
itself
does
not
list
in
it
what
a
prison
can
or
cannot--
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
--okay.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
we
are
still
saying
that
the
prisoner
under
you
question,
your
honor,
would
have
to
exhaust
the
process
because
one,
there
still
may
be
something
that
can
satisfy
him.
two,
even
if
there
isn't,
there
may
be
something
that
can
benefit
the
prison
and
the
other
inmates
and
three,
that
even
if
all
the
above
fail,
the
prisoner
can
still
go
to
court
and
that's
all
congress
really
wanted.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
that
would
not,
your
honor,
and
again
that
gets
to
our
definition
of
available.
if
the
prison
will
accept
and
address
the
complaint,
he
has
an
available
remedy.
under
your
question,
the
prison--
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
--it
doesn't
hinge
as
much
on
remedy,
your
honor,
as
it
does
on
whether
the
prison
will
take
the
complaint
and
address
it
in
any
way
and
under
your
question--
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
--no,
that
would
more
be
the
petitioner's
interpretation
of
the
statue
as
meaning
that
the
prisoner
has
to
get
what
he
wants,
that
would
not
be
our
interpretation--
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
--that
would
not
be
an
available
remedy,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
it
is
not,
justice
scalia,
as
i'm
interpreting
the
question.
i'm
interpreting
the
question--
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
--no,
i'm
just
saying,
will
they
address
it
all?
and
under
your
question,
your
honor,
the
prison
is
saying,
you
can
bring
us
the
complaint.
we're
not
going
to
do
anything
about
it,
but
if
it
makes
you
feel
better,
you
can
drop
it
on
our
doorstep,
there
is
no
available
remedy
there.
that
is
almost...
that's
an
exclusion
of
the
claim.
mr.
gerald
j.
pappert
thank
you,
your
honor.
