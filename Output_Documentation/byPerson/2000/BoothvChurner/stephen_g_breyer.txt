justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
this
case
the
statute
says,
no
action.
it
doesn't
say
particular
claim
for
something.
it
says
no
action
shall
be
brought
until
such
administrative
remedies
as
are
available
are
exhausted.
your
client,
i
take
it,
brought
an
action
and
in
that
action,
he
wanted
a
transfer
of
records,
a
bunch
of
different
things,
as
well
as
damages.
so
at
least
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
why
wasn't
there
for
that
action
remedies
to
exhaust,
namely
all
the
transfer
part,
all
the
other
parts?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
looking
at
the
statute,
the
statute,
though,
and
the
statute
refers
to
action
and
this
is
a
mixed
action.
and
i
would
think
there's
a
very
strong
argument
that
whatever
you
think
about
somebody
who
runs
into
court
and
files
a
claim
only
for
money
damages,
where
a
prisoner
asks
for
both,
he
shouldn't
be
able
to
bring
his
money
claim
in
court
until
after
he's
exhausted
his
prison
remedies
in
respect
to
what
there
is
to
exhaust
and
there's
a
lot.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
what
i
want
to
know,
what's
the
rationale
for
allowing
a
person
who
has
the
mixed
claim
to
go
to
federal
court
at
all,
if
he
doesn't
first
go
and
exhaust
what
he
has
to
exhaust?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
but
the
argument
is...
as
are
available,
as
we'll
hear
the
complaint.
i
mean,
obviously
they'll
hear
it,
but
i
take
it
that
they're
willing
to
hear
it.
he
has
a
complaint
about
something,
guard
hit
me,
as
are
exhausted.
i
mean,
do
you
see
the
obvious
thing?
am
i...
what's
the
answer
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
available
means
they'll
hear
it.
of
course
if
they
won't
hear,
you
don't
have
to
go
there.
will
they
hear
it
in
your
case
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
does
that
mean?
i
mean,
that's
the...
i
mean,
i
imagine
this
is
a
case,
which
it
isn't,
which
is
only
money
damages
were
at
stake.
there's
nothing
else
at
stake.
what
does
it
mean
to
exhaust
a
process
where
all
you
want
is
money
and
they
can't
give
you
any
money,
what
does
that
mean?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
does
it
mean?
what
does
it
mean
to
accept
it
and
hear
it
when
the
prisoner's
only
asking
for
money?
what
does
that
mean?
can
you
give
content?
i
know
i
wanted
to
hear
her
response,
but
i'm
still
puzzled
by
my
own
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
is
that
a
forfeit?
how
does
he
forfeit
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
part
i
don't
understand.
suppose
it's
15
days,
all
right
he
has
to
file
in
15
days,
what's
the
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true
of
any
claim
that
he
has
to...
i
mean,
that
would
be
true
of
every
claim--
