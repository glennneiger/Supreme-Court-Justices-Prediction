ms.
nancy
winkelman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
an
excessive
force
action
brought
by
a
state
prisoner
under
section
1983
that
was
dismissed
on
the
grounds
that
the
prisoner
had
not
exhausted
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania's
three-tiered
prison
grievance
system.
the
case
turns
on
an
issue
of
statutory
construction,
whether
when
first
enacting
and
then
amending
section
1997e(a),
to
limit
the
exhaustion
provisions
to,
quote,
such
administrative
remedies
as
are
available.
congress
intended
to
require
a
prisoner,
whose
remedy
is
one
for
monetary
damages,
to
address
a
past-completed
constitutional
violation
to
exhaust
a
prison
grievance
system
that
cannot
provide
such
a
remedy.
of
course,
the
backdrop
of
this
case
is
that
there's
no
general
exhaustion
requirement
in
section
1983.
but
what
is
key
here
is
that
when
congress
first
enacted
the
section
1997e
exception
in
1980
and
then
when
it
amended
section
1997e
in
1996,
while
dramatically
strengthening
and
changing
the
exhaustion
provision
in
many
respects,
it
retained
the
key
words,
such
administrative
remedies
as
are
available.
ms.
nancy
winkelman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
congress
took
out
the
words
plain,
speedy
and
effective
in
1996,
along
with
making
exhaustion
mandatory
rather
than
discretionary,
removing
the
stay
provision
and
a
number
of
other
changes.
the
purpose
of
taking
out
plain,
speedy
and
effective,
though,
those
words
did
not
drive
the
result
that
we're
seeking
here.
they
didn't
drive
the
inquiry
of
whether,
in
fact,
the
prison
grievance
system
could
provide
the
relief.
what
those
words...
what
the
work
that
those
words
did
in
the
prior
statute,
and
this
is
evident
from
looking
at
the
present
statute,
which
is
reprinted
on
page
5a
of
respondent's
brief.
ms.
nancy
winkelman
your
honor,
when
mr.
booth
brought
his
claim,
it's
true
that
he
sought
both
what
we
know
as
injunctive
relief
and
money
damages
and
in
fact
that
was
the
basis
upon
which
respondents
opposed
our
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
that
this
was
a
mixed
case.
but
the
question
that
we
presented
was
a
money
damages
only
case
and
that's
the
question
that's
before--
ms.
nancy
winkelman
--actually,
your
honor,
the
courts
of
appeals
have
taken
a
different
approach.
the
tenth
circuit--
ms.
nancy
winkelman
--the
courts
of
appeals
haven't
explained
their
reasoning
in
the
decisions,
but
one
possibility
would
be
a
practical
one,
which
is
if
in
a
mixed
claim
situation
the
prisoner
has
to
go
back
and
exhaust
both
the
injunctive
and
the
monetary
part,
it's
likely
that
their
monetary
claim...
they
would
risk...
face
a
high
risk
of
forfeiting
their
money
claim
because
it
would
be
too
late
to
exhaust
that
through
the
prison
grievance
system.
pennsylvania's,
for
example,
is
five
days.
it's
15
days
for
bringing
your
initial
grievance.
so
if
mr.
booth's
case
had
been
dismissed,
he
would
have
been
out
of
time,
in
all
likelihood
by
that
point,
to
pursue
the
money
claim
through
the
grievance
procedure,
which
is
why
i
think
the
courts
of
appeals
had
approached
the
issue
and
dealt
with
this
problem
by
permitting--
ms.
nancy
winkelman
--my
argument
justice
ginsburg
is
that
when
he
brought
his...
he
brought
his
mixed
action,
that
is
true.
if
he
had
been...
if
that
action
had
then
been
dismissed,
go
back
and
exhaust
because
there
are
injunctive
claims
in
here
that
need
to
be
exhausted,
he
would
have
been,
he
would
have
been
time-barred
from
pursuing
the
money
damages
claim
then
in
federal
court
because
he
had
to
bring
his
grievance,
under
pennsylvania's
grievance
procedure,
within
15
days
of
the
incident.
by
the
time
he
brings
his
action
in
federal
court,
the
federal
court
then
dismisses.
he's
too
late.
ms.
nancy
winkelman
if
our
interpretation
is
right
on
the
money
damages
point,
and
i'd
like
to
go
there,
if
that's
right
then
the
approach
that
the
tenth
circuit
took
in
the
miller
case,
i
think,
addresses
the
concern.
the
prisoner
brings
a
mixed
claim.
the
court
allows
the
money
damages
aspect
of
the
claim
that
the
tenth
circuit
agrees
does
not
have
to
be
exhausted
to
go
forward,
thereby
avoiding
this
problem
of
the
prisoner
perhaps
losing
the
money
damages
claim
all
together
because
they
could
never
exhaust
the
claim.
it's
too
late.
ms.
nancy
winkelman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
nancy
winkelman
it's
not
exactly
if
you
want
money.
it's
if
what
you
are
seeking
and
the
relief
that
you're
seeking,
that
the
prisoner's
seeking
in
the
1983
action,
is
not
available,
cannot
be
provided--
ms.
nancy
winkelman
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
nancy
winkelman
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question,
justice
scalia,
lies
in
the
whole
purpose
of
administrative
exhaustion.
what
are
we
talking
about
here?
we're
talking
about,
in
any
context,
prisoner
context,
or
security
context,
any
other
context,
an
individual
going
to
an
administrative
agency
when
that
agency
can
provide
the
relief.
here
there's
no
question--
ms.
nancy
winkelman
--your
honor,
if
congress
had
intended
to
require
exhaustion
in
every
case,
a
blanket
exhaustion
rule,
it
would
have
and
could
have
written
such
a
statute,
but
it
didn't
do
that
in
1980
and
when
congress
had
the
opportunity
in
1996,
and
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
question
about
effective
because
i
don't
think
i
answered
that
completely.
when
congress
had
the
opportunity
in
1996
to
create
this
kind
of
blanket
exhaustion,
we
want
all
prisoner
problems
to
go
through
the
prison
grievance
system,
it
didn't
do
that,
it
retained
the
six
words.
ms.
nancy
winkelman
let
me
suggest
to
you
what
we...
that
the
kind
of
the
statute
that
we
would
think
would
be
this
blanket
exhaustion,
exhaustion
every
case,
it's
a
good
thing
for
prisons.
the
statute
is
at
issue
in
mcneil,
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
an
action
shall
not
be
instituted
under
the
ftca
unless
the
claimant
shall
have
first
presented
the
claim
to
the
appropriate
federal
agency.
so
this
statute
could
have
said
congress
could
have,
rather
than
advertently
leaving
in
the
words,
until
such
administrative
remedies
as
are
available,
congress
could
have
written
a
broad
exhaustion
statute.
ms.
nancy
winkelman
it
might
be--
ms.
nancy
winkelman
--justice
kennedy,
it's
not...
this
isn't
a
general
prison
notification.
there
may
be
benefits
to
having
prisons
know
about
problems
in
the
first
instance.
we
don't
dispute
that.
we
don't
dispute
that
there
are
benefits
to
prison
grievance
systems,
but
the
point
here
and
our
argument
is
that
congress
kept
in
these
words.
it
didn't
create
an
ftca
type
statute
and
what's
important--
ms.
nancy
winkelman
--if
the
result
is
that
all
prison
complaints
and
all
prison
problems
are
aired
through
the
prison
grievance
system
first,
then
i
submit
that
congress
could
have
created
that
type
of
statute,
but
congress
didn't
do
that.
ms.
nancy
winkelman
i
agree
that
there's
some
ambiguity
in
the
word
remedy
and
procedure
and
it's
something
certainly
that
we've
struggled
with,
with
the
word
remedy
in
the
statute,
that
sometimes
it
can
mean
an
administrative
procedure
and
sometimes
it
can
mean
the
right.
where
we've
come
out
is
that
in
this
statute
it's
probably
doing
double
duty
in
some
sense,
but
when
it--
ms.
nancy
winkelman
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
it's
still
an
administrative
remedy
as
are
available.
it
means
both
procedure
and
it
means
something
that
can
actually
give
you
the
right,
the
relief
that
you
seek,
something
that
can
actually
redress
the
wrong.
that's
the
meaning
of
remedy.
ms.
nancy
winkelman
chief
justice
rehnquist,
this
problem
of
bypass,
i
think,
is
a
little,
somewhat
overblown
in
some
of
the
briefs.
it's
conjectural.
in
fact,
the
empirical
evidence
would
point
to
the
contrary
that
in
the
circuits,
in
the
fifth
and
the
ninth
circuits,
that
have
held
our
away
on
the
money
damages
point,
there
hasn't
been
this
bypass
and
this
explosion
of
litigation
and
that
makes
sense
because
if
what
the
prisoner
wants,
the
prisoner
can,
in
fact,
get
through
the
prison
grievance
process,
then
just
like
the
state's
amicus
brief
points
out,
numerous
grievances
are
resolved
in
a
prisoner's
favor.
they
would
go
there.
i
need
a
different
cell.
i
need
to
be
housed
without
a
smoker.
why
would
they
give
up
the
injunctive
relief
that
they
want
simply
to
get
into
federal
court
where
they
have
to
today
pay
a
filing
fee,
at
least
in
installments,
where
they
risk
losing
one
of
their
three
lifelong
strikes
if,
in
fact,
their
proceeding
ifp
and
their
case
is
dismissed?
so--
ms.
nancy
winkelman
--your
honor,
in
that
situation,
justice
ginsburg,
the
prisoner
would
have
to
go
through
the
prison
grievance
system
because
the
prison
grievance
system,
while
it
couldn't
provide
the
one-to-one
correlation
of
the
relief
could
provide
the
category
of
relief
and
certainly
our
position
wouldn't
preclude
a
cap
such
as
the
one
that
you
posit
your
hypothetical.
but
in
that
situation
there
is
a
monetary
damages
remedy
available.
it
may
not
be
a
perfect
remedy.
it
may
not
be
the
one-to-one
fit,
but
the
difference
between
that
case
and
our
case,
is
that
in
our
case
there
was
no
monetary
damages
remedy
available
at
all
and
that's
why
mr.
booth,
as
a
matter
of
administrative
exhaustion,
didn't
have
to
go
through
that
process.
remember,
when
we're
talking
about
administrative
exhaustion
and
congress
can
be
presumed
to
have
been
legislating
when
it
chose
and
then
retained
these
words,
such
available...
such
administrative
remedies
as
are
available,
that
there's
a
long-standing
jurisprudence
in
the
administrative
law
area
about
the
futility--
ms.
nancy
winkelman
--certainly
that
was
a
purpose
of
the
prison
litigation
reform
act.
we
acknowledge
that
and
there
are
numerous
provisions
in
the
plra
that
go
to
that
point,
the
filing
fee,
the
three
strikes
provision,
all
the
enhanced
mechanisms
for
a
district
court's
screening
of
prisoner
complaints.
and
even
this
very
statute
was
amended
in
significant
respects
to
channel
far
more
grievances
and
complaints
through
the
grievance
system
before
they
could
come
to
court.
it's
mandatory
rather
than
discretionary.
there's
no
more
stay.
there's
no
more
federal
oversight
of
the
adequacy
of
the
state
procedures,
but
congress
fell
short
we
believe
when
it
retained
those
words
against
a
backdrop
of
administrative
law
jurisprudence
about
futility.
when
it
retained
those
words,
congress
intended
to
preserve
that
avenue
for
prisoners
and,
in
fact,
there
are
other
parts--
ms.
nancy
winkelman
--certainly,
justice
scalia,
there
would
be
some
threshold
at
which
the
prison
grievance
system's
damages
might
be
so
nominal
as
to
not
be
the
kind
of
relief
that
we're
talking
about.
i
don't
know
exactly
where
that
line
is.
but
the
other
point
in
terms
of
statutory
interpretation
is
that,
if
all
congress
meant
to
do
was
to
say
that
prisoners
have
to
go
through
every
prison
grievance
system,
then
these
words
would
be
superfluous.
what
could
they
mean,
such
administrative
remedies
as
are
available?
certainly,
if
there's
not
a
procedure
in
existence,
congress
wasn't
trying
to
say
a
prisoner
has
to
go
through
that.
ms.
nancy
winkelman
i
think
actually,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
we're
putting
less
uncertainty
into
the
act
than
respondents'
reading
is
because,
even
respondents
don't
take
the
extreme
position
that
such
administrative
remedies
as
are
available
means
any
procedure
in
existence.
even
respondents
acknowledge
that
the
procedure
has
to
be,
the
administrative
remedy
has
to
be
capable
of
addressing
the
subject
matter
of
the
prisoner's
complaint.
and
with
that
in
mind
that
would
create
more
work
on
the
district
courts
because
instead
of
just
looking
at
what
the
prisoner
is
seeking,
what
relief
and
then
is
that
available
in
the
grievance
system,
they're
going
to
have
to
parse
through
the
subject
matter
of
the
complaint,
parse
through
whether
the
grievance
system
can
actually
address
that,
which
i
think
it
would
create
more
work
for
the
district
courts.
ms.
nancy
winkelman
but
if
that's
the
case,
your
honor,
then
i'd
go
back
to
the
point
then
the
words
are
superfluous,
why
are
they
in
there
if
there's
no
doubt?
ms.
nancy
winkelman
if
all
congress
meant
was,
is
there
a
procedure
in
existence
or
does
the
procedure
address
the
subject
matter,
it
didn't
need
to
say
such
administrative
remedies
as
are
available
because
certainly
it
goes
without
saying
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
grievance
procedure
in
existence
and
that
that
procedure--
ms.
nancy
winkelman
--because
congress
couldn't
have
been
intending
to
write
a
statute
that
would
require
a
prisoner
to
exhaust
if
there
was
no
procedure
in
existence
to
begin
with.
ms.
nancy
winkelman
but
available
means--
ms.
nancy
winkelman
--in
that
case,
again
i
think
it
goes
without
saying,
i
think
that
those
words
then
aren't
necessary.
certainly
if
the
prison
grievance
system...
if
there's
no
grievance
procedure
or
if
it
won't
hear
this
type
of
complaint,
then
nobody's
suggesting
that
the
prisoner
would
have
to
go
through
it.
congress
didn't
need
to
add
those
six
words
and
retain
those
six
words
if
that's
all
it
meant
to
do.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
nancy
winkelman
and
i
have
three
points,
your
honor.
number
one,
there's
been
a
lot
of
discussion
about
the
types
of
remedies,
disciplining
the
guard,
apologies
and
so
forth.
i
would
point
out
and
emphasize
that
none
of
what
has
been
mentioned
is
a
remedy
to
the
prisoner
for
the
particular
wrong.
in
this
case,
mr.
booth
was
assaulted
by
prison
guards.
the
only
remedy
available
to
address
that
wrong
to
him
is
money
damages.
transferring
the
prison
guard
is
not
going
to
provide
redress
to
mr.
booth
for
the
wrong
that
was
inflicted
upon
him.
and
as
counsel
for
the
respondent
conceded,
mr.
booth
has
a
high
risk
of
forfeiting
his
money
damages
claim
under
section
1983
completely
for
no
reason.
the
prison
grievance
system
cannot
remedy
that
wrong.
he
has
everything
to
lose.
ms.
nancy
winkelman
because
if
he
misses
one
of
these
short
time
frames
through
the
prison
grievance
system
as
is
pointed
out
in
mccarthy--
ms.
nancy
winkelman
--if
he...
the
prison
grievance
system
has
three
levels.
if
he
misses
one
of
those
time
frames
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
mccarthy,
he
has
a
high
risk
of
forfeiting
his
federal
claim
all
together
because
when
he--
ms.
nancy
winkelman
--that's
true,
but
in
the
injunctive
context,
he
has
something
to
gain.
here
he
has
nothing
to
gain.
the
second
point
is,
is
that
in
terms
of
what
about
couldn't
it
just
mean
that
the
prison
grievance
will
hear
the
complaint.
i
would
return
this
court
to
the
words
in
first
iowa
of
55
years
ago.
when
congress
intends
for
a
litigant
to
do
something
futile,
it
has
to
be
explicit
about
it.
here
congress
was
far
than
explicit
about
it.
under
our
view,
we
think
it
was
said
the
opposite.
at
best
it
was
ambiguous,
but
certainly
congress
didn't
explicitly
require
a
prisoner
to
do
a
futile
act.
and
the
final
point
on
the
deletion
of
the
word
effective,
i
would
point
the
court
to
the
prior
statutory
scheme
because
the
words
plain,
speedy
and
effective
in
that
scheme
right
on
the
face
of
the
statute
went
only
towards
the
procedural
aspects
of
the
state
grievance
procedure.
did
it
prevent
against
reprisals?
could
it
deal
with
things
quickly
enough?
that's
what
congress
took
out.
but
what
congress
left
in
was
such
administrative
remedies
as
are
available,
which
we
believe
have
force
and
in
this
situation
the
only
remedy
available
was
to
pay
damages.
