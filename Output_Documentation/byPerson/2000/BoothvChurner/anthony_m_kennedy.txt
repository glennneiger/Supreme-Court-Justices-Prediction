justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
would
work.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
statute
that
the
congress
has
here
is
better.
there
may
be
cases,
not
just
as
justice
scalia
indicated
where
the
claim
is
insubstantial,
there
may
be
cases
where
it's
very
substantial.
but
the
courts
are
certainly
helped
by
having
a...
suppose
they
had
a
hearing,
the
guard
was
disciplined,
reprimanded.
they
restored
whatever
disciplinary
demerits
or
they
erased
any
disciplinary
action
that
was
taken
against
the
petitioner.
that
would
be
very
helpful
to
the
court.
now
maybe
they
can't
give
damages,
but
that's
the
next
stage.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you're
saying
that
it's
just
irrelevant
to
the
courts,
that
there
are
some
disciplinary
mechanisms
that
the
prisoner...
that
cover
this
incident.
it's
not
saying
that
he
has
to
apply
for
library
privileges
or
something.
it
is
to
cover
this
incident
and
help
clarify
and
crystallize
the
situation.
then
he
goes
and
asks
for
damages.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
ftca
statute
doesn't
work
because
you
don't
make
a
claim
for
damages.
what
the
congress
is
saying
here
is
there
are
other
benefits
besides
simply
processing
this
claim.
we
want
to
have
the
entire
incident
investigated
first
and
you
can't
make
that
parallel
between
the
ftca
and
this
statute.
this
statute
served
purposes
that
are
not
served
by
the
ftca
example
you
put
out
and
this
statute
is...
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
the
congress
could
have
taken
the
ftca
analogy
to
accomplish
the
result
that
it
wants
to
accomplish
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
somewhat
concerned
about
your
cautious
answer.
you
said,
well
he
could
make
argument
that
there's
equitable
tolling.
that
indicates
to
me
that
the
state
at
some
later
time
is
to
going
take
the
position
there's
no
tolling
and
that's
of
great
concern.
if
that's
your
position,
i'd
like
to
know
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
am
concerned
about
the
fact
that
there's
no
general
tolling
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
suppose
the
state
in
all
good
faith
is
behind,
and...
how
long
is
the
statute
of
limitations
for
filing
on
the
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
i
can
see
a
court,
prison
system
taking
18,
19
months
and
you
say
there's
no
tolling.
