we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
99-1964,
timothy
booth
v.
c.o.
churner.
ms.
winkelman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
also
took
out
the
words
about
effective,
did
they
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
of
the
practical
difficulties
of
your
interpretation
is
that
i
gather
a
prisoner
by
simply
saying
he
wants
money
damages
in
any
case
can
avoid
the
grievance
system
entirely
even
though
money
damages
might
not
be
a
major
part
of
what
he
wants.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you're
right,
ms.
winkelman,
federal
judges
are
going
to
have
to
say,
does
this
prison
system
allow
for
damages?
and
maybe
it
won't
always
be
clear
whether
it
does
or
not.
and
secondly,
what
is
the
cutoff
point
in
damages,
which
you
say
there
must
be,
between
just
allowing
enough
to
require
exhaustion
and
not
requiring
it
and
not
awarding
enough.
so,
you're
putting
more
uncertainty
into
the
act
it
seems
to
me.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
i
mean,
as
is
opposed
to
applying
for
a
library
card,
is
there
really
going
to
be
much
doubt
about
whether
a
prison
system
can
address
a
type
of
grievance?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
winkelman.
mr.
pappert,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--a
court
might
well
say
that
a
remedy,
which
took
a
greater
length
of
time
than
the
statute
of
limitations,
was
not
available
since
the
idea
of
exhaustion
of
remedies
is
to
get
ready
to
go
to
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
at
any
rate
a
predicate
to
going
to
court.
it
contemplates
the
idea
that
at
the
end
of
the
administrative
road,
the
prisoner
may
still
want
to
go
to
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
a
chaplain
in
the
armed
forces,
which
perhaps
sometimes
serves
that
purpose,
you
know
you
go
talk
to
the
chaplain,
nothing
much
happens.
thank
you,
mr.
pappert.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gornstein.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gornstein.
ms.
winkelman,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
ms.
winkelman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
