justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
would
agree
with
you
that
congress
perhaps
could
have
been
clearer
about
it.
but
i
want
to
ask
you
just
a
textual
question
to
see
whether
we
disagree
on
that.
i
will
admit
that
when
i
first
looked
at
the
statute
i
thought
remedies
referred
to
form
of
relief.
but
after
reading
the
briefs
and
reading
the
statute
a
few
more
times,
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that,
in
fact,
remedies
was
an
ambiguous
word.
it
could
either
mean
form
of
relief
or
it
could
mean
administrative
process.
and
one
of
the
textual
clues,
it
seems
to
me,
that's
in
there
to
indicate
that
congress
meant
administrative
process
was
its
use
of
the
word
exhaust.
we
don't
normally
speak
of
exhausting
the
relief
that
you
get.
i
mean,
like
running
through
the
money
damages
and
having
a
good
time,
that's
what...
i
mean,
exhaustion
usually
refers
to
exhausting
a
particular
process.
so
just
at
kind
of
step
one,
the
textual
point
here
seemed
to
me
probably
to
make
a
better
argument
or
support
a
better
argument,
that
what
congress
was
talking
about
when
it
used
relief
was
administrative
process
rather
than...
a
remedy
rather.
it
was
using
administrative
process
rather
than
particular
relief
awarded.
would
you
comment
on
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
it's
doing
double
duty,
doesn't
that
nix
your
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
--why
does
it
have
to
go
without--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
that's
so,
why
doesn't
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
why
do
you
take
the
position...
there
may
be
a
very
simple
answer
to
this,
but
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
why
do
you
take
the
position
that
it,
why
you
assume
that
the
statute
of
limitations
on
the
damage
action
cannot
be
tolled?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
don't
assume
that
then
you
don't
have
the
problem
that
you
got
into
with
justice
ginsburg.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
not
saying
that
there
would
be
a
satisfaction
of
the
statue
in
the
case
in
which
the
prison
literally
simply
provided
a
forum
for
complaints
and
said
we'll
never
do
anything
about
them,
but
if
you
want
to
get
them
off
your
chest,
sure
you
can
come
in
and
tell
us.
you're
not
claiming
that
that
would
satisfy?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
if
some
remedy
of
some
sort
is
available,
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
if
it...
when
you
say
address,
i
assume
address
with
the
object
of
providing
relief
if
there
is
merit
in
the
complaint,
some
kind
of
relief.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
mean
that
is
the
prison's
argument,
but
i
mean,
i'm
suggesting
that
perhaps
the
prisoner
would
have
a
good
argument
here
if
the
prison
said,
we
have
a
system
that
does
not
provide
relief.
we
simply
have
a
system
in
which
you
can
come
up
and
make
your
complaints
and
feel
better
for
having
talked
to
somebody.
the
prisoner
would
say
there
surely,
in
that
case,
we
don't
have
to
go
through
the...
under
the
statute
does
not
require
us
to
go
through--
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
procedure
leading
to
some
conceivable
relief.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
prison
litigation
reform
act
of
1995
amended
42
u.s.c.
section
1997e(a).
that
section
now
requires
a
prisoner
to
exhaust
what
it
calls
such
administrative
remedies
as
are
available
before
suing
over
prison
conditions.
when
the
petitioner
booth
sued
the
respondents
who
are
a
group
of
corrections
officers
under
section
1983
for
alleged
abuses,
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
for
failure
on
booth’s
part
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies.
the
third
circuit
affirmed
rejecting
booth’s
argument
that
the
exhaustion
requirement
does
not
apply
to
his
case
because
the
prison’s
administrative
process
could
not
award
him
the
monetary
relief
he
sought
when
money
was
at
that
point
the
only
relief
he
still
requested.
we
granted
certiorari.
in
a
unanimous
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
third
circuit,
and
hold
that
under
the
statute
an
inmate
seeking
only
money
damages
must
still
complete
any
prison
administrative
process
capable
of
addressing
the
subject
of
the
inmate’s
complaint
even
if
the
process
does
not
make
specific
provision
for
monetary
relief.
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
“such
administrative
remedies
as
are
available”
is
the
crux
of
the
case.
neither
practical
considerations
nor
other
dictionary
definitions
of
the
words
remedies
and
available
urged
by
the
parties
are
conclusive
in
seeking
the
congressional
intend
here.
clearer
clues
have
found
in
the
broader
statutory
context
in
which
congress
referred
to
“available”
administrative
“remedies”,
and
in
the
statutory
history
of
this
section.
this
history
shows
that
exhaustion
is
required
regardless
of
the
relief
offered
through
the
administrative
procedures.
before
subsection
a
was
amended
a
court
had
discretion
to
require
an
inmate
to
exhaust
what
the
statute
then
called
“such
remedies
as
are
available”,
but
only
if
the
remedies
were
plain,
speedy
and
effective
in
the
statutory
words.
congress
however,
has
eliminated
both
the
discretion
to
dispense
with
administrative
exhaustion
and
the
condition
that
the
remedy
be
effective
before
exhaustion
can
be
required.
in
mccarthy
v.
madigan
decided
in
1992,
we
interpreted
the
requirement
of
an
effective
remedy
so
as
to
excuse
exhaustion
by
those
seeking
only
money
damages
when
money
was
unavailable
at
the
administrative
level.
it
has
to
be
significant
that
congress
removed
the
very
term
effective
that
the
mccarthy
court
had
previously
emphasized
in
reaching
the
result
that
booth
now
seeks,
and
the
fair
inference
to
be
drawn
is
that
congress
meant
to
preclude
the
mccarthy
result,
which
would
be
in
booth’s
favor
here.
