mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
plra
requires
an
inmate
to
exhaust
available
administrative
remedies
without
regard
to
whether
they
offer
the
relief
that
the
inmate
seeks
in
court.
so
if
an
institution
responds
to
legitimate
complaints
about
excessive
force
through
such
means
as
disciplining
the
officer
involved--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--then
we
would
say
that
no
administrative
remedies
are
available.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
on
that
small
point
and
i
don't
think
it
would
come
up
very
much
because
almost
often...
almost
in
all
cases
there
would
be
something
that
the
administrative
process
could
do
about
the
complaint
and
here
we're
talking
about
a
complaint
about
excessive
force.
so
the
available
remedies
that
have
to
be
in
existence
is
just
something
that
addresses
complaints
about
excessive
force
and
it
could
be
transferring
the
inmate
to
another
area,
it
could
be
disciplining
the
officer
involved
and
directing
the
officer
not
to
repeat
that
conduct
and
that
would
show
that
administrative
remedies
are
available
and
an
inmate
would
have
to
exhaust,
even
if
he
only
wants
to
seek
money
in
court.
now
that
conclusion
follows
when
the
textual
changes
that
congress
made
in
the
statute.
before
the
act
was
amended,
exhaustion
could
only
be
required
when
the
available
administrative
remedies
were
effective.
and
this
court
said
in
mccarthy
against
madigan
that
administrative
remedies
are
not
effective
when
the
inmate
seeks
only
money
and
the
administrative
process
does
not
offer
that
specific
form
of
relief.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
of
course,
it
was
dictum,
but
when
congress
is
reviewing
a
statute
and
are
attempting
to
amend
it,
it's
very
unlikely
that
congress
is
going
to
make
fine
distinctions
about
whether
this
court
had
a
holding
or
an
analysis
that
was
necessary
to
the
holding
or
that
it
was
dicta.
what
congress
was
faced
with
was
an
interpretation
of
the
term
effective
and
the
court
interpreted
it
to
mean
then
when
administrative
remedies
do
not
offer
money
and
the
inmate
is
seeking
money,
the
administrative
available
remedies
are
not
effective
and
in
that
context,
congress's
elimination
of
the
term
effective
shows
that
congress
intended
to
require
inmates
to
exhaust
available
remedies
in
all
cases,
including
ones
like
that
in
mccarthy,
in
which
the
inmate
seeks
only
money
and
the
available
remedies
do
not
offer
money.
so
what
we
have,
what
the
statue
essentially
says
to
an
inmate,
is
if
you
have
a
complaint
about
prison
conditions
and
the
administrative
process
will
address
it
in
some
way,
you
must
give
the
administrative
process
a
chance
to
do
it
to
your
satisfaction
and
if
they
cannot
do
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
think
it's
some
relief,
but
that's
what
i
think
is
implicit
in
a
grievance
procedure.
i
would
just
use
the
word
grievance
procedure.
a
grievance
procedure
is
something
that
offers
some
relief
for
the
kind
of
complaint
that
an
inmate
is
complaining
about.
and
the
reason
congress
made
the
particular
changes
that
it
made
here
is
it
wanted
to
reduce
the
enormous
burden
that
these
kinds
of
cases
were
placing
on
federal
district
courts
and
the
change
that
it
made
accomplishes
that
in
two
important
ways.
first
of
all,
an
inmate
may
start
out
wanting
nothing
other
than
money
and
he
may
end
up
being
satisfied
with
something
else.
and
second
of
all,
you
have
cases
where
the
inmate
receives
a
decision
on
the
merits
and
he
decides
after
seeing
that
decision
that
this
is
not
a
claim
that's
worth
pursuing
in
court.
and
finally,
it's
important
to
note
that
very
few
state
administrative
programs
offer
money
for
anything
other
than
personal
property
loss.
so
the
consequence
of
accepting
the
petitioner's
construction
here
would
be
that
an
inmate
would
have
the
ability
in
a
wide
range
of
cases
to
avoid
the
exhaustion
requirement
simply
by
formulating
a
complaint
that
seeks
only
money.
if
the
court
has
nothing
further--
