justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
follow
that
if
he
hadn't
come
to
court
at
all.
if
the
rule
is,
if
you
want
more
than
one
kind
of
relief,
you
must
go
to
the
administrator
within
five
days,
whatever.
so
the
idea
is,
i
think
what
justice
breyer
was
suggesting,
that
is
if
you
have
a
mixed
claim,
this...
what
you're
trying
to
present,
you
said,
the
question
we
presented
is
damages
only.
you
want
this
court
to
treat
this
case
as
though
there
were
never
any
claims,
anything
else
other
than
money
damages
and
i
understand
that
that's
how
you
would
like
this
case
to
be
treated,
but
if
we
take
this
very
case,
i
am
not
following
your
argument
that
there
would
be
any
loss
of
time
and
a
time
bind
for
the
defendant
if
you
must
go
swiftly
to
the
prison
system
and
name
everything.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
point
is
he
should
never
have
come
to
a
federal
court.
on
the
interpretation
that
you've
got
a
mixed
claim,
don't
come
to
federal
court,
exhaust.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
about
that?
is
it
your
position,
let's
say,
it
was,
you
were
seeking
nothing
but
money,
that
it
is
not
required
even
to
take
the
first
step.
here
there
were
three
steps
in
the
grievance
procedure,
the
first
was
taken.
there
was
an
administrative
complaint
filed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
the
prisoner
said,
i'm
not
going
to
go
on
to
steps
two
and
three.
but
i
take
your
argument
to
be,
if
you
want
money,
you
don't
even
have
to
take
step
one.
you
can
go
directly
to
court.
you
don't
have
to
complain
within
the
prison
system
at
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
just
asking
you
to
answer
that
question
yes
or
no.
on
your
theory,
am
i
right,
is
not
available,
you
don't
even
have
to
take
step
one?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
could
be
all
sorts
of
remedies,
damages,
injunctions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
winkelman,
i
wanted
to
get
a
clearer
handle
than
i
now
have
on
the
nature
of
the
claim
you
think
you
have.
you
were
candid
in
saying
before,
if
you
have
this
kind
of
claim,
you
can
go
directly
to
court
with
no
administrative
filing
at
all.
suppose
the
administrative
process
does
include
some
kind
of
monetary
relief,
but
it's
got
a
cap,
say
a
thousand
dollars
capped.
and
your
client's
view
is
they
beat
me
to
a
bloody
pulp
and
a
thousand
dollars
wouldn't
begin
to
compensate
me
for
my
injury.
could
such
a
person,
in
your
view,
go
directly
to
court
because
there's
no
available
remedy?
there's
a
monetary
remedy
but
it's
capped.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'd
like
to
ask
you
now,
i
understand
the
nature
of
the
claim
you're
asserting.
suppose
i
were
of
the
view,
this
statute
is
nor
crystal
clear.
it
could
be
read
either
way.
it
could
be
read
to
say,
if
there's
administrative
process,
you
have
to
exhaust
it
or
it
could
be
read
to
say,
only
if
the
kind
of
relief
you're
seeking
is
available
must
you
exhaust.
then
when
the
text
doesn't
tell
me
which
one
of
those
is
right.
why
isn't
the
proper
perspective
what
congress
was
trying
to
do?
one
thing
we
know
congress
was
trying
to
do,
is
to
curtail
prisoner
litigation.
why
wouldn't
it
be
appropriate
for
a
court
to
say
well
that's
going
to
be
how
i
break
the
tie?
the
text
could
be
read
either
way,
but
i
know
that
congress
wanted
to
curtail
prisoner
litigation
so
i'm
going
to
read
it
the
way
that
will
keep
cases
out
of
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
it's
not...
you're
saying,
tough
luck.
you're
saying
congress
built
a
process,
which
the
prison...
if
the
prison
wants
to
defeat
ultimate
relief
in
court,
could
just
string
it
out
till
the
time
limit
is
up
and
say,
well,
too
bad,
we
got
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
could
understand
the
deadlines
for
within
the
prison
process.
i
don't
understand
something
that
says
we
give
you...
the
clock
starts
ticking
when
the
event
occurs,
when
the
alleged
assault
occurs.
and
even
if
you're
in
the
twirls
of
the
administrative
process,
it
continues
to
tick
and
if
the
time
is
up
while
you're
still
in
the
administrative
process,
too
bad,
you
can't
get
to
court,
but
that's
what
you're
telling
me
this
statute
does.
and
i
don't
see
the
rationale
to
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
to
clarify
one
other
thing?
as
i
recall,
in
your
brief,
you
said
one
of
the
virtues
of
the
administrative
process
is
that
it
can
establish
a
factual
record,
but
i
think
part
of
this,
isn't
it
part
of
the
pennsylvania
rules
that
whatever's
developed
in
the
grievance
system
cannot
be
used
in
court?
