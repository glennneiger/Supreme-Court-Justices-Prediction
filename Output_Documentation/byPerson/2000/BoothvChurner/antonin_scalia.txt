justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
how
you
get
there
from
the
statute.
i
mean,
you
would
have
the
statute
read
until
such
administrative
remedies
providing
the
same
relief
are
exhausted
and
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
until
such
administrative
remedies
as
are
available.
i
mean,
that's
a
very
broad
phrase,
such
administrative
remedies
as
are
available.
justice
antonin
scalia
on
what
basis
do
you
want
it
limited
to
only
those
remedies
that
provide
your
client
the
same
relief
he
wants
in
the
1997e
action.
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
that
may
well
be
with
respect
to
those
exhaustion
requirements
that
are
devised
by
the
courts
without
any
statutory
requirement,
but
it
is
entirely
conceivable
that
an
exhaustion
requirement
would
have
other
purposes
as
your
opponents
claim
here,
simply
making
the
prisoner
go
through
a
lengthy
procedure
that
may
satisfy
him
even
though
the
relief
is
not
the
same
or
that
may
persuade
him
that
the
factual
basis
for
his
claims
are
so
insubstantial
that
it's
no
use
troubling
the
federal
courts
with
them.
there
are
a
lot
of
other
reasons
for
making
him
go
through
these
hoops
before
he
is
one
of
the,
what,
45,000
prisoners
a
year
who
run
into
federal
court
right
away.
that
seems
to
be
a
perfect
valid
purpose
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
way
the
statute
reads.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
possible
language
i
would
use
if
i
were
writing
a
statute
to
demand
precisely
that
result,
other
than
the
language,
until
such
administrative
remedies
as
are
available
are
exhausted.
i
mean,
that
seems
to
me
to
do
precisely
what
you
say
congress
hasn't
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
winkelman,
when
justice
ginsburg
followed
up
on
her
question,
i
thought
she
was
going
to
follow-up
by
asking
what
if
the
damages
available
in
the
prison
grievance
procedure
were
only
50
dollars?
i
presume
your
answer
would
be
the
same
since
there
is
a
damage
remedy
available
in
the
administrative
procedure
you
have
to
exhaust,
which
means
that,
you
know,
that
what
you're
proposing
to
us
besides
not,
in
my
view,
corresponding
to
the
text
of
the
statute
doesn't
even
have
the
virtue
of
providing
fairness
it
seems
to
me.
why
should
it
be
if
i
can
get
50
dollars
i
have
to
go
through
the
prison
grievance
procedure
when
i'm
claiming
10,000
dollars
of
actual
damages?
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
words?
i
don't
understand.
you
did
say
that
before
and
i
didn't
understand
what
you
meant.
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
his
complaint
is
not
money.
his
complaint
is
that
a
guard
whacked
him
over
the
head
or
something
of
that
sort.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
way
the
statute
reads,
it
says
with
respect
to
prison
conditions,
no
action
shall
be
brought
with
respect
to
prison
conditions
until
such
administrative
remedies
as
are
available
are
exhausted
and
i
gather
the
condition
here
is
the
fact
that
guards
go
about
whacking
people
over
the
head
and
the
remedies
for
that
are
presumably
whatever
remedies
the
prison
provides
for
when
you
get
whacked
over
the
head,
which
might
include
money
damages,
but
might
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
there's
nothing
at
the
end
of
it?
you
mean
it's
just
a
process.
we,
you
know,
we're
not
going
to
give
you
anything
but
we're
going
to
have
a
hearing
and
then
an
appeal
and
then
a
second
appeal.
of
course,
you
can't
get
any
relief.
surely
it
doesn't
mean
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
come
on,
this
is
a
sort
they
likes-to-but-what
kind
of
an
argument.
what...
if
indeed
what
the
prison
can
provide
is
more
attractive
to
the
prisoner
than
money
presumably
you
wouldn't
need
this
statute
to
make
him
go
through
the
prison
procedure.
he
would
use
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
a
different
argument.
don't
tell
me
that
you're
helping
the
prisoner
because
there
a
lot
of
things
that
he
would
think
even
more
valuable
than
money.
if
he
would
think
them
even
more
valuable
than
money,
he'd
use
them.
this
is
forcing
the
prisoner
to
go
through
the
prison
procedure,
which
presumably
he
doesn't
want
to
go
through.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
assume
the
statute
of
limitations
on
his
money
claim
or
any
other
claim
that
he
cannot
get
in
the
prison
grievance
system
would
not
start
running
until
the
exhaustion
of
the
administrative
remedies?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
have
eliminated
the
last
couple
of
minutes
of
a
very
difficult
discussion.
justice
antonin
scalia
justice
souter
was
saying
less
than
that.
justice
souter
was
saying,
and
i
confess
i
don't
know
any
other
situation
in
which
you
are
compelled
to
exhaust
and
the
statute
keeps
on
running
while
you're
exhausting.
that
seems
to
be
a
very
unusual
situation.
justice
souter
was
suggesting
that
the
statute
of
limitations
is
simply
tolled
while
you're
exhausting
and
you
think
that
is
conceivable
too,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
consider
that
to
be
an
administrative
remedy,
even
though
it
doesn't
give
any
benefit
to
the
inmate
at
all.
that's
pretty
tough
statutory
construction.
justice
antonin
scalia
until
such
administrative
remedies
as
are
available
are
exhausted,
i'd
be
inclined
to
say
that
if
the
prison
can't
give
me
any
satisfaction
that's
going
to
do
me
any
good,
there
is
no
administrative
remedy
available.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
that's
nice.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say
process
though,
it
says
remedies.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
means
a
process
that
provides
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
not?
it's
a
procedure.
it's
a
procedure
and
it's
available.
i
thought
you
say
remedy
means
procedure.
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
was
dictum
there,
of
course.
