mr.
chinn,
i
think
you
answered
to
an
earlier
question
that
the
dominant
reason
for
this
program
is
to
catch
people
who
distribute,
unlike
the
alcohol
stops,
the
sobriety
checks,
that
the
dominant
purpose
is
not
to
catch
dangerous
drivers,
and
you
have
no
record
of
distinguishing
between
those
two,
so
we
have
to
assume...
well,
you
have
been
candid
about
it.
your
purpose
is
to
catch
people
who
are
distributing
drugs.
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
don't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
rationale
with
the
car
was
a
lesser
expectation
of
privacy
in
a
car,
say,
as
opposed
to
a
home,
but
if
you're
going
to
do
expectation
of
privacy,
one
can't
be
seen,
i
suppose
the
street
would
be
lowest
because
the
car,
at
least
you
are
sheltered
by
the
car
itself.
on
the
street
there
you
are.
everybody
can
see
you,
so
the
rationale
that
you're
offering,
i
think,
would
apply
at
least
as
much.
a
high
crime
area,
you
have
reason
to
suspect
that
people
are
going
to
get
away
so
that
the
police
are
there
to
check
them,
and
is
there
a
distinction
based
on
the
expectation
of
privacy?
i
don't
see
it,
but
perhaps
you
can
explain
it
to
me.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
chinn,
wasn't
there
the
factor,
the
locational
factor
there
that
the
stop,
although
distant
from
the
border,
was
on
the
main...
the
road,
the
highway
that
you
would
take
if
you
were
going
from
the
mexican
border
into
the
interior
because
that's
where
all
the
traffic
flowed.
but
here
you
don't
have
that.
it
could
be
any...
anyplace.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
was
a
fact
in
the
case.
there
wasn't
any
question
it
was
a
main
highway
that
people
used,
traveling
from
mexico.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
other
words,
in
order
to
do
it,
the
city
has
candidly
told
us
it
wants
it
to
apprehend
drug
distributors,
it
has
this
pretense
of
stopping
people
to
check
their
licenses
an
also
purpose,
but
it's
using
that
as
a
gateway
to
get
to
what
it's
really
interested
in,
which
is
the
drug
distribution.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
you
said
that
they
would
have
to
do
that.
mr.
chinn
told
us...
candidly,
i
thought,
to
his
credit...
that
the
primary
purpose
of
doing
this
is
to
apprehend
drug
distributors.
so
you're
saying,
yeah,
but
they
couldn't
just
do
that
openly
or
overtly,
they
need
some
kind
of
cover
for
it.
so
we
do
the
license
check.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
let's
take...
then
let's
take
away
that.
you
are
saying
without
the
license
and
registration
check
this
would
still
be
okay,
we
just
stop
people
because
we
want
to
have
the
dog
go
around
the
car.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
trying
to
reconcile
that
decision
as
a
piece
of
a
tapestry
with
the
ones
that
had
to
do,
for
example,
with
the
fire
investigation
when
this
court
did
make
something
of
a
purpose
line.
they
said
if
you
want
to
find
out
how
this
fire
got
started,
that's
regulatory
and
it's
okay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you're
trying
to
find
the
arsonist,
it's
not
okay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
was
it
advertised
to
the
public?
i
forgot
what
those
signs
were.
i
know
there
was
a
sign
that
said
canine,
but
what
was
the
other
sign?
wasn't
it
drug
checkpoint
ahead?
