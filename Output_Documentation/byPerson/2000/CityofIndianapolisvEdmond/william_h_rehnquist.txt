william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
chinn.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--is
that
the
only
purpose?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
reasoning
of
the
court
in
martinez-fuerte?
there
you
had
a...
a...
a...
a...
a
stop
with...
without
a
search,
and
unless
there
was
probable
cause.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
chinn.
ms.
millett,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
millett.
mr.
falk,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
the
seizures
in
martinez-fuerte
and
sitz
were
also
seizures
of
primarily
entered
in.
no
one
claims
they
had
a
51
percent
harvest
there.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
martinez-fuerte
they
arrested
these
people.
that's
how
the
case
came
to
this
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
did
the
court
say,
then
in
martinez-fuerte?
what
did
it
say
the
main
purpose,
the
programmatic
purpose,
as
you
call
it,
was?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
could
the
city
show
that
without
having
done
some
investigation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
dog...
the
dog
is
not
a
search
under
our
place.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
it's
a
stop.
not
just
arguably.
the
court
has
said
it's
correct.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
beyond
the
scope
of
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
can't
the
city
or
the
state
have
a
multipurpose
stop?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
counsel
here
said
that
there
were
three
purposes
for
the
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
service...
at
what
point
do
you
think
the
city
would
have
to
make
that
showing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
the
city
council
would
have
to
pass
a
resolution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
justifying
it
at
what
point?
i
mean,
when
it's
brought
to
court,
as
it
was
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
not
saying
they
would
have
to
justify
it
beforehand?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me
in
court,
the
lower
court,
the
district
court
they
found
that
there
were
additional
purposes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
surmised?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
that
was
satisfactory
for
the
district
court,
are
you
saying
it's
clearly
erroneous
to
have
found
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
no
bright
line.
i
read
over
martinez-fuerte
twice
in
the
last,
and
i
simply
don't
find
any
statement
in
there
that
the
seizure
was
primarily
regulatory.
can
you
refer
me
to
language
in
the
case
that
says
that?
they
ended
up
arresting
the
people.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
where
does
it
say
in
martinez-fuerte
that
the
seizure
is
primarily
regulatory?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
asked
you
about
martinez-fuerte.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
says
it's
regulatory?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--would
you
say
stopping
for
driver's
license,
a
man
who
doesn't
have
a
driver's
license
is
not
a
criminal
investigatory
purpose?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
deemed
by
whom?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there's
also
a
presumption
you've
committed
a
crime.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
falk.
mr.
chinn,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you
all.
thank
you,
mr.
chinn.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-1030,
city
of
indianapolis
versus
edmond
will
be
announced
by
justice
oâ€™connor.
