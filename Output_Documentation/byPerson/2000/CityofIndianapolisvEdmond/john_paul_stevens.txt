justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record...
does
the
record
tell
us
how
many
of
these
drug
arrests
involved
persons
who
were
selling
drugs
as
opposed
to
those
who
might
have
just
been
using
them
themselves?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
your
case
be
as
strong
if
the
record
showed
that
every
one
of
the
persons
stopped
just
happened
to
be
a
casual
user
or
something
and
then
had
some
drugs
left
in
the
car?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
really...
you
don't
really
have
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
some
of
them
may
be
selling
drugs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
seems
to
be
your
argument,
the
strength
of
your
case
depends
on
the
success,
your
success
rate.
in
other
words,
you
prove
it
was
reasonable
by
what
you
find
rather
than
by
what
you
knew
before
you
started.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
i
read
your
brief,
it's
important
to
your
case
that
5
percent
of
the
people
in
indianapolis
apparently
don't
have
their
driver's
license
with
them
and
another
5
percent
have
some
marijuana
in
the
car.
if
there
was
only
1
percent,
your
case
would
be
much
weaker.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
didn't
know
that
until
you
conducted
the
searches.
justice
john
paul
stevens
sort
of
like...
sort
of
like
you
found
something
there,
ergo,
it
was
reasonable
to
look
for
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
your
first
point
about
martinez,
how
would
you
respond
to
justice
scalia's
question?
would
that
checkpoint
have
been
legal
in
indianapolis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
a
constitutional
matter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
with
what
we
now
know
about
indianapolis,
just
right
as
of
today,
do
you
think
it
would
be
legal
to
have
the
martinez-fuerte's
checkpoint
in
indianapolis
today?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
did
they
have
to
show
them
before
they
conducted
these
checkpoints
here,
did
the
city
have
to
show
that
5
percent
of
the
people
were
driving
without
licenses
or
did
they
find
that
out
after
they
did
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
high
crime
statistics
they
got
as
a
result
of
the
program
they
instituted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
really
arguing
that
there's
a
difference
between
pretext
when
it's
an
individual
officer
acting
and
pretext
when
it's
a
regulatory
program.
that's
the
heart
of
your
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
word
motive
instead
of
pretext.
