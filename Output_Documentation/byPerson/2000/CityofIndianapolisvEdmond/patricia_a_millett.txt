ms.
patricia
a.
millett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
is
first
the
petitioner's
checkpoints,
including
their
drug
detection
component,
are
constitutional
under
this
court's
decisions
in
martinez-fuerte,
which
upheld
a
checkpoint
designed
to
intercept
alien
smuggling,
and
sitz,
which
upheld
a
sobriety
check-in...
checkpoint.
second,
petitioner's
checkpoints
are
also
constitutional
because
they
advance
the
government's
legitimate
interests
in
assuring
that
only
properly
licensed
and
sober
drivers--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--as
a
constitutional
matter,
yes.
as
a
statutory
matter,
no.
the
border
patrol--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--does
not
have
authority
to
go
beyond
a
hundred
miles.
as
a
constitutional
matter,
if
the
government,
border
patrol
was
able
to
show
that,
for
example,
in
indianapolis
or
kansas
or
between...
somewhere
in
colorado
there
was
a
thoroughfare
that
had
a
strong
nexus
to
alien
smuggling,
for
example,
seasonal
workers
moving
back
and
forth,
then
it
would
be.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
think
we
would
have
to
show
an
alien
smuggling
nexus
to
the
roadways
on
which
we
established
our
checkpoints.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
think
they
have
to
establish...
they
have
to
have
a
reasonable
basis
for
believing
that
there
will
be
a
problem.
obviously,
we
have
that
with
the
alien
checkpoints
that
the
border
patrol
operates,
and
here
the
city
of
indianapolis
focused
on
crime
statistics
and
was
able
to
determine
that
particular
areas--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
no,
no,
general
crime,
drug
crime
statistics,
which
you
obviously
will
know
in
advance
as
a
law
enforcement
agency,
just
as
we
know
where
the
primary
problems
of
alien
transportation
are
in
the
country.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
think
as
a
constitutional
matter,
if
the
government
were
able
to
show
the
appropriate
nexus
and
the
effect
that
its
checkpoints
again
were
actually
effective
that
it
would...
and
the
intrusion
was
no
more
than
it
was
in
martinez-fuerte,
but,
yes,
the
fourth
amendment
applies
the
same
in
indianapolis
as
it
does
in
arizona.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no,
not
at
all.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
there's
a
bright
line
in
this
court's
decisions
between
cars
and
pedestrians.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
first,
it's
beneficial.
i
don't
think
there's
anything
about
this
case
that
puts
us
closer
to
pedestrian
checkpoints
than
martinez-fuerte
and
sitz,
but
the
rationale
has
been--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--because
cars
are
different
than
pedestrians.
cars
are
highly
regulated.
this
court
has
recognized
this
they
are
subject
to
a
web
of
regulation
by
government,
and
i
think
it
was
justice
breyer
earlier
said
one
has
no
reasonable
expectation
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
you
will
not
be
briefly
stopped
and
asked
to
show
a
driver's
license,
your
authority
to
operate
the
car,
and
under
martinez-fuerte
that
you
are
not
using
the
car
to
smuggle
illegal
aliens,
we
see
no
difference
between
that
and
smuggling
drugs.
and
in
this
case
the
drug
component
isn't
necessary
to
explain
the
seizure.
the
entire
scope
of
the
seizure
is
independently
justifiable.
in
fact,
most
of
the
time
is
expended
on
the
driver's
license
checkpoints.
the
only
role
of
the
drug
detection
component
is
that
they're
in
a
justifiable
stop
under
this
court's
precedence
for
driver's
license
checkpoint
and
sobriety
checkpoint.
they
add
a
canine
sniff
for
dogs.
that
does
not
independently
cause
the
seizure,
although
we
do
think
a
drug
checkpoint
in
its
own
right
is
constitutional,
but
it
does--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--yes.
i
think
the
police
have
a
right
to
be
on
street
corners
with
their
dogs
or
without
their
dogs,
and
smell...
the
sniff
the
dog
alerts
to
is
odors
emanating
from--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
that
then
i
think
would
be
a
seizure
of
a
pedestrian
if
they
won't...
can't
get
away,
but
the
pedestrian
can
walk
away.
it's
a
big
difference.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no,
i
don't
think
so.
because
the
difference
between
the
pedestrian
example
and
this
one
is
that
you
have
a
legitimate
basis
for
the
seizure
independent
of
the
dog.
that's
the
driver's
license
checkpoint.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
that...
that...
well,
i
think
it's
a
separate
question
whether--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i'm
not
sure
that
a
traffic
light,
in
fact,
effectuates
a
seizure
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
because
pedestrians
can
turn
around
and
walk
away,
they
can
do
a
u-turn.
i'm
sorry.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
my
understanding
is
that
it's
done
while
the
driver's
license
check
is
going
on.
and
that's
what
takes
the
two
to
three
to
five
minutes.
dog
sniffs
take
a
minute,
90
seconds
at
the
most
for
a
very
large
vehicle.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
it
doesn't...
we
have
two
rationales.
our
position
is
that
drug
interdiction,
drug
smuggling
checkpoints
in
their
own
right
are
constitutional,
so
obviously
under
that
theory
it
would
not.
but
if
the
court
disagrees
with
that
and
says
that
that
is
not
a
legitimate
basis
for
having
a
checkpoint,
then
the
case
would
be
different
if
they
did
the
stop
and
they
did
not
actually
effectuate
the
interests
that
are
served
by
a
driver's
license
checkpoint,
they
didn't
ask
for
the
licenses,
and
they
didn't
act
upon
license
violations.
if
they,
in
fact,
act
upon
license
violations
and
serve
that
interest
within
the
meaning
of
this
court's
prior
recognition
of
that
as
a
legitimate
interest,
then
the
fact
that
they
also
serve
another
legitimate
interest
that
does
not
in
any
way
change
the
nature
of
the
intrusion
on
the
individual,
does
not
enhance
the
length
or
duration
or
intensity
of
the
seizure,
then
it
would
not
make
a
difference,
and
then
what
the
government
says
or
doesn't
say
in
the
preamble
i
don't
think
would
change
the
fourth
amendment
analysis.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
you
mean
pretense
by
the
fact
that
they
ask
for
licenses
but
don't
do
anything
about
it?
and
i
profess
to
do
something--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that's
not
what
i
mean
to
say.
our
position
is
that
a
drug
checkpoint
in
its
own
right
would
be
constitutional.
border
patrols,
the
drug
smuggling,
aliens--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i'm
saying
two
things.
we're
saying
that's
our
first...
that's
our
first
argument.
our
second
argument
is
if
the
drug
interdiction
purpose
is
not
in
itself
a
basis
for
the
stop,
then
as
long
as
the
driver's
license
stop
or
the
sobriety
stop
is
actually
being
accomplished
by
the
government,
those
interests
are
being
served,
and
the
drug
detection
component
does
not
add
anything
to
the
length
or
duration
of
the
seizure,
then
it
would
still
be
constitutional
under
both
of
them.
and
that
if
both
of
them
are
legitimate
interests,
if
the
court
doesn't...
as
long
as...
as
long
as
one
legitimate
interest
is
served
by
the
checkpoints
and
explains
the
entire...
and
justifies
the
entire
scope
and
duration
and
intensity
of
the
seizure,
the
fact
that
the
government
has
other
interests,
primary
or
secondary,
doesn't
matter.
