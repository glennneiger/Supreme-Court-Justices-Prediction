mr.
kenneth
falk
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
not
martinez-fuerte.
this
case
is
not
sitz.
the
indianapolis
roadblocks
are
criminal
investigatory
seizures
of
primarily
innocent
persons
without
cause.
in
martinez-fuerte--
mr.
kenneth
falk
--that's
correct,
but
this
court
recognized,
your
honor,
for
instance,
in
montoya
de
hernandez
that
martinez-fuerte
was
one
of
a
number
of
cases
reflecting
the
long-standing
concern
for
the
protection
of
the
integrity
of
the
border,
which
has
been
characterized
as
a
noncriminal
investigatory
concern.
mr.
kenneth
falk
well,
of
course,
your
honor,
but
in
camara
back
in
1967,
violation
of
the
housing
codes
in
issue
there
were
criminal.
in
new
york
v.
burger,
violation
of
the
regulatory
statute
turned
out
to
be
criminal.
this
court
in
all
those
cases
looked
back
to
see
what
the
programmatic
purpose
was,
and
recognized
that
the
programmatic
purpose
was
not
for
criminal
investigation.
if,
in
fact
a--
mr.
kenneth
falk
--protection,
integrity
of
the
borders,
your
honor,
have
been
recognized
by
this
court
since
i
believe
the
1880s
in
the
united
states
v.
boyd,
that
the
united
states
has
an
inherent
regulatory
right
to
ensure
that
people
and
things
that
enter
this
country
do
so
lawfully.
that
is
a
regulatory
purpose.
similarly,
lower
courts
have
recognized
through
inspection
and
checking
licenses,
registrations,
and
inspection
status
has
recognized
a
safety-related
purpose
for
traffic
stops.
mr.
kenneth
falk
and
drunk
driving,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
falk
if
the...
if
the
city
of
indianapolis
could
show
here
that
there
was,
indeed,
a
problem
of
drugged
driving,
like
there
was
in
sitz
of
drunk
driving,
then
of
course
there
could
be
a
regulatory
purpose.
mr.
kenneth
falk
well,
i
think
if
you
looked
at
sitz
there
were
reams
of
statistics
introduced
there
to
show
what
the
national
and
local
problem
of
drunk
driving
was.
sitz
recognized...
i'm
sorry?
mr.
kenneth
falk
sitz
recognizes
that
there
is
a
regulatory
right
of
a
state
to
get
an
immediately
unsafe
vehicle
off
the
road.
in
the
same
way
that
a
car
without
brakes
is
imminently
unsafe
to
innocent
persons,
so
is
a
car
driven
by
a
drunk
driver.
mr.
kenneth
falk
arguably,
your
honor,
but
even
those
stops,
even
those
noncriminal
investigatory
seizures
have
to
be
justified
under
brown,
there
has
to
be
a
showing
there
actually
is--
mr.
kenneth
falk
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
falk
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
falk
subjective
intent
is
irrelevant
provided
there
is
otherwise
probable
cause.
mr.
kenneth
falk
but
there
is
no
cause
here,
your
honor,
and
this
court
has
insisted--
mr.
kenneth
falk
--well,
there's
not
a
criminal
investigatory
cause.
and
i
would
add,
your
honor,
that
this
court
has
made
it
clear
in,
for
instance,
in
terry,
you
cannot
go
beyond
the
scope
of
what
is
allowed
by
the
narrow
exception
to
the
cause
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment.
michigan
v.
clifford,
same
example.
mr.
kenneth
falk
well,
your
honor--
mr.
kenneth
falk
--obviously
adding
the
dog
goes
beyond
the
scope
of
a
license
checkpoint.
a
dog
is
not
necessary
to
check
licenses.
under
the
roadblocks--
mr.
kenneth
falk
--well,
arguably
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
falk
the
court
has
said
that
a
search
of
unattended
luggage
is
not...
by
a
dog,
a
sniff,
excuse
me,
is
not
a
search,
but
i'm
assuming
it's
not
a
search
for
this
purpose,
your
honor,
but
still
it
is
clearly
beyond
the
scope.
it
is
something
unnecessary--
mr.
kenneth
falk
--beyond
the
scope
of
what
is
allowed
for
the
regulatory
intrusion
to
check
someone's
license,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
falk
well,
but
your
honor,
this
is
a
seizure.
mr.
kenneth
falk
this
is
not
like
stopping
at
a
red
light.
this
is
being
pulled
over
by
a
sign
saying,
warning,
drug
interdiction
checkpoint
ahead.
mr.
kenneth
falk
this
is
a
search
to
look
for
drugs,
your
honor.
no
matter
how
quickly
one
shows
a
valid
license
or
registration,
one
cannot
leave
the
checkpoint
until
the
dog
sniffs
the
car.
mr.
kenneth
falk
the
city
of
indianapolis
concedes
that
the
primary
purpose
of
this
search,
excuse
me,
of
this
seizure
is
to
look
for
drugs.
mr.
kenneth
falk
they
have
conceded
that,
i
believe,
in
their
briefs.
they
conceded
that
today
before
this
court.
mr.
kenneth
falk
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
cannot
answer
that.
all
i
can
answer
is
that
everything
that
an
individual
is
told
when
they
are
stopped,
they
are
told,
you
are
now
at
a
drug
roadblock.
they
are
told,
this
is
a
drug
interdiction
checkpoint
coming
ahead
with
canines
to
check
for
drugs.
you
cannot--
mr.
kenneth
falk
--the
trial
court
found
that
from
the
fact
that
the
licenses
were
checked,
that
there's
a
secondary
purpose
to
look
for
licenses.
the
seventh
circuit,
judge
posner
found
that
the
primary,
not
sole
purpose
was
to
look
for
evidence
of
drugs,
and
in
fact
as
i've
indicated,
everyone
is
told
when
they're
pulling
up
there
is
no
pretense,
there
is
no
one
saying
this
is
a
license
roadblock,
you
are
at
a
drug
checkpoint.
and
even
if
as
i
indicated
this
was
a
checking
of
licenses,
there
is
no
valid
reason
to
go
beyond
that
and
introduce
the
drug-detecting
dog
unless
you
are
now
converting
this
seizure
which
arguably
might
be
a
regulatory
seizure
into
one
for
purposes
of
criminal
investigation.
mr.
kenneth
falk
arguably
they
could.
they
don't
in
this
case,
but
arguably
they
could.
but
you
still
have
to
look--
mr.
kenneth
falk
--the
city
has
never
attempted,
never
attempted
below
to
justify
even
under
brown
having
a
license
checkpoint.
there
never
was
a
showing
that
there
was
a
public
need
for
this.
there
was
never
a
showing
that
the
means
used
were
not
overly
intrusive,
and
in
fact
advanced
that
effort.
mr.
kenneth
falk
i
think
at
some
level
they
would
have
to
show
that
they
believe
this
is
a
problem
in
indianapolis
and
this
is--
mr.
kenneth
falk
--no,
i
mean
in
the
course
of
justifying
their
search
to
the
court.
mr.
kenneth
falk
yes.
mr.
kenneth
falk
no.
mr.
kenneth
falk
the
lower
court
found
only
that
licenses
and
registrations
were
taken,
and
from
that
she
surmised
this
secondary
purpose.
mr.
kenneth
falk
well,
there
is
no
other
evidence,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
falk
no,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
way
the
roadblock
is
set
up
that
licenses
and
registration
are
taken
to
hold
the
people
there
so
that
the
dog
can
sniff
the
car.
mr.
kenneth
falk
yes,
your
honor,
that
would
be
unconstitutional
because
you
have
now
gone
beyond
the
scope
of
what
is
arguably
a
valid,
noncriminal
investigatory
seizure
under
brown.
arguably--
mr.
kenneth
falk
--yes,
your
honor.
this
court
has
never
said
you
can
take
a
noncriminal
investigatory
seizure
and
incrementally
add
things
to
it
and
still
be
constitutional.
the
opposite
is
true.
let's
go
back
to
opperman,
inventory
case.
you
can
have
one
officer
searching
a
car
and
another
officer
searching
the
exact
same
car,
i
mean
another
car
in
the
exact
same
way,
two
different
searches
exactly
the
same.
one
can
be
constitutional
because
the
programmatic
purpose
is
not
criminal
investigation,
an
inventory
search.
the
other
could
be
unconstitutional
if
the
officer
is
looking
for
evidence
of
a
crime.
mr.
kenneth
falk
yes,
it
does,
and
for
the
reason
i
indicated.
mr.
kenneth
falk
your
honor--
mr.
kenneth
falk
--your
honor,
we're
not
asking
this
court
or
any
court
to
go
inside
the
head
of
people
to
see
what
their
real
purpose
is.
when
you
add
the
dog,
there
is
only
one
purpose.
a
dog
cannot
check
licenses
or
registrations.
mr.
kenneth
falk
no,
provided
they
use
that
expertise
in
a
way
that
does
not
require
dogs
or
equipment
or
anything
that
is
beyond
the
scope--
mr.
kenneth
falk
--sure.
of
course.
and
that's
analogous
to
doing
an
inventory
inspection
of
a
car
and
seeing
evidence
of
a
crime
in
plain
view.
mr.
kenneth
falk
because...
but
you've
added
the
dog.
you've
added
something
which
is
beyond
the
scope.
it's
not
in
plain
view.
you've
added
something
completely
different
and--
mr.
kenneth
falk
--your
honor,
we
are
arguing
this
because
we...
the
question
has
been
asked,
what
if
there
was
a
legitimate
secondary
purpose.
we
have
contended
all
along
in
both
the
lower
courts
and
our
briefs
that--
mr.
kenneth
falk
--your
honor,
i
cannot
tell
you
what
the
city
would
and
would
not
have
done
but
for
the
drug
search
seizing.
mr.
kenneth
falk
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
falk
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
falk
programmatic
purpose
has
always
been
extremely
important
in
searches
or
seizures
which
are
designed
for
things
other
than
criminal
investigation.
mr.
kenneth
falk
the
problem,
your
honor,
is
if
we
lose
the
purpose
inquiry
procedures
which
are
not
inherently
regulatory
like
martinez-fuerte,
which
are
not
immediately
concerning
safety,
like
sitz,
then
we
are
going
to
end
up
with
pedestrian
roadblocks
because--
mr.
kenneth
falk
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
as
i
said,
they
arrested
people
in
burger
and
arguably
could
have
arrested
in
camara.
mr.
kenneth
falk
martinez-fuerte
does
talk
about
the
immigration
problems,
and
other
cases
i
cited
this
court
back--
mr.
kenneth
falk
--no,
there
is
nothing
in
martinez-fuerte,
your
honor,
that
specifically
says
it's
regulatory.
mr.
kenneth
falk
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
falk
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
falk
of
course.
and
in
opperman
this
court
found
it
extremely
important
that
the
seizures
there
and
the
searches
were
pursuant
to
a
noncriminal
inventory
purpose.
mr.
kenneth
falk
well,
if
the
category
collapses
in
multiple
dimensions,
the
first
collapse,
as
this
court
noted
in
questionings
of
mr.
chinn
is
what
about
things
that
are
serious
concerns
to
the
city
other
than
drugs?
so
we
will
have
an
expansion
to
what
other
problems,
people
not
paying
parking
tickets,
people
not
paying
child
support,
other
things
of
stopping
motorists.
it
also
collapses,
however,
as
far
as
who
can
be
seized.
if
the
argument
is
that
somehow
getting
into
your
car
is
a
surrender
of
your
privacy
interests,
that
same
argument,
as
you
noted,
applies
to
a
pedestrian
in
a
high
crime
neighborhood.
why
not
stop
that
person?
that
person
has
by
going
out
in
public
surrendered
a
significant
amount
of
privacy,
arguably
more
than
i
surrender
when
i
drive
down
the
street
in
my
car.
ultimately
what
the
city
is
arguing,
i
believe,
is
that
if
we
subject
everyone
to
the
same
degree
of
intrusion
pursuant
to
this
plan,
that
that
somehow
makes
everything
constitutional,
but
this
court
has
never
viewed
the
fourth
amendment
as
somehow
being
something
that
allows
everyone
to
be
treated
in
an
even-handed
manner.
as
long
as
everyone's
constitutional
rights
are
violated
in
the
same
way,
that's
appropriate.
mr.
kenneth
falk
it's
an
unsafe
car
involved,
as
justice
o'connor
noted.
it's
an
immediately
unsafe
car
that
is
going
to
cause
imminent
harm
to
innocent
persons
because
it
is
a
deadly
weapon
when
driven
by
someone
who
is
drunk
or
drugged.
mr.
kenneth
falk
but
it
doesn't...
that's
correct,
but
it
doesn't
translate
to
searching
the
trunks
of
cars
to
search
for
drug
smugglers,
it
doesn't
translate
to
that
at
all.
it
translates
to
checking
to
see
if
someone
is
drunk
or
someone
is
impaired.
mr.
kenneth
falk
there
is
an
increase
in
intrusion
when
the
state
turns
a
criminal
investigatory
eye
on
presumably
innocent
persons,
yes.
mr.
kenneth
falk
yes.
mr.
kenneth
falk
yes.
mr.
kenneth
falk
yes.
mr.
kenneth
falk
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
falk
this
is
most
definitely
a
drug
case.
the
city
has
always
indicated
its
primary
purpose
is
to
interdict
drugs,
not
to
find
drugged
drivers.
the
city
has
always
said
that's
not
the
purpose.
the
purpose
is,
as
the
city
conceded
this
morning,
to
stop
bad
guys
carrying
drugs,
from
carrying
them
through
the
streets
of
indianapolis,
and
that
is
why
it's
no
different
than
a
pedestrian
search,
because
there
are
bad
guys
carrying
drugs
who
are
walking
through
the
streets
of
indianapolis.
mr.
kenneth
falk
and,
again,
assuming
that
was
the
case
here,
which
i
do
not
believe
it
is,
because
i
think
we
are
dealing
with
a
primarily
if
not
sole
drug
issue,
but
even
assuming
that
sort
of
mixed
motive
which
you're
hypothesizing--
mr.
kenneth
falk
--then
what
we
have
is
a
criminal
investigatory
seizure
done
without
any
individual--
mr.
kenneth
falk
--no,
it's
not.
it's
a
seizure.
when
you
have
a
dog
there,
it's
a
seizure
to
look
for
drug
activity.
mr.
kenneth
falk
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
falk
there
has
been--
mr.
kenneth
falk
--because--
mr.
kenneth
falk
--because
then
you're
going
back
to
having
a
seizure
which
is
for
criminal
purposes
which
is
beyond
the
scope
of
what
might
otherwise
be
allowed
in
a
noncriminal
investigation.
mr.
kenneth
falk
yes,
although
i
think
in
defense
of
indianapolis,
they're
not
winking.
they're
coming
out--
mr.
kenneth
falk
--if
you
break
the
distinction
down
between
criminal
investigatory
purpose
and
a
noncriminal
investigatory
purpose--
mr.
kenneth
falk
--i
believe,
your
honor,
that
that's
been
deemed
to
be
regulatory
because--
mr.
kenneth
falk
--well,
i
think
in
lower
courts,
in
approaching
the
problem,
have
deemed
that
to
be...
the
desire
is
to
remove
immediately
unsafe
people
off
the
roads.
there's
a
presumption
if
you
have
no
license
you're
unsafe.
mr.
kenneth
falk
well,
yes,
your
honor,
but
again
this
court
has
recognized,
as
i
said,
in
camara
and
burger
and
other
cases
that
you
can
have
a
regulatory
purpose
and
a
criminal
investigatory
purpose.
mr.
kenneth
falk
and
that's
why
sitz
said
that,
because
martinez-fuerte,
i
believe,
was
there,
indicating
that
for
that
seizure
which
was
not
a
criminal
investigatory
seizure,
which
was
part
of
the
inherent
regulatory
right
of
the
united
states
to
regulate
people
and
things
coming
into
the
united
states,
in
that
you
use
a
balance,
but
if
we
abandon
the
cause
requirement
when
it's
a
pure
criminal
investigation,
then
we
will
have
seizures
which
are
based
on
a
perceived
governmental
need.
mr.
kenneth
falk
a
dog
searching...
if,
in
fact...
if,
in
fact,
this
court's
case
law
allowed
regulatory
seizures
at
that
point
for
purposes
of
contraband,
yes.
mr.
kenneth
falk
it
is,
and
i
don't
like
using
the
word
pretext
because,
again,
i
think
the
city
of
indianapolis
isn't
being--
mr.
kenneth
falk
--it's
a
primary,
what
is
the
purpose,
and
this
court
itself
in
opperman
said
here
the
primary
purpose
is
noncriminal
investigatory.
in
burger
the
primary
purpose
is
noncriminal
investigatory,
and
the
reason
for
that
was
because
if
it
was
a
criminal
investigatory
purpose,
there
would
have
to
be
specific
cause.
mr.
kenneth
falk
because
the
danger,
then,
i
believe
is
that
a
sufficient
government
interest,
the
drug
crisis,
will
be
sufficient
to
overcome
the
privacy
interests
which
this
court
has
always
recognized
as
something
held
by
individuals
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
kenneth
falk
the
record
is
not
clear,
your
honor.
the
only
thing
the
record
indicates
is
that
there's
an
affidavit
from
an
officer
which
says
it's
usually
done
at
the
same
time,
but
it's
also
clear
from
the
record
that
no
one
can
leave
the
checkpoint
until
they're
sniffed
by
a
dog.
so
it's
clear
that
there
are
times
when
the
last
thing
being
done
is
being
sniffed
by
a
dog,
and
that
makes
sense.
if
you're
just
checking
licenses
and
registrations,
it
won't
take
five
minutes,
and
given
the
size...
there
are
30
police
officers
there.
given
the
number
of
cars,
the
dogs
have
to
do
multiple
cars,
and
inevitably
i
believe
there's
going
to
be
a
wait
for
the
dog.
but
obviously,
your
honor,
the
risk
here
is
that
if
we
break
down
the
barrier
here
and
allow
this
seizure
which
is
clearly
for
criminal
investigatory
purposes
to
occur
without
cause,
then
we
will
be
faced
with
ever-increasing
incursions
which
will
be
balanced
away
because
if
the
problem
is
deemed
serious
enough,
if
the
intrusion
is
deemed
minimal
enough,
we
will
have
seizures
of
persons
on
streets.
