mr.
a.
scott
chinn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
city
of
indianapolis
operates
roadway
checkpoints
comprised
of
conduct
that
in
other
relevant
contexts
this
court
has
approved.
the
court
of
appeals
declined
to
apply
this
court's
brown
versus
texas
balancing
test
to
evaluate
that
conduct
because
the
checkpoints
primarily
investigate
crimes,
but
the
city's
checkpoints
are
constitutional
for
two
independent
reasons.
first,
this
court
used
the
balancing
test
in
upholding
other
roadway
checkpoints
where
the
government's
interests
was
to
investigate
crimes.
second,
the
city's
checkpoints
serve
sobriety
checking
and
driving
regulation
interests
that
this
court
has
approved
and
the
city's
drug
checking
conduct
adds
no
additional
intrusion
to
these
procedures.
the
roadway
checkpoints
this
court
has
previously
upheld--
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
--it's
to
do
both,
your
honor,
but
primarily
to
look
for
drug
possession
and
trafficking
in
cars.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
not
in
this
case.
on
this
record
there
is
no
evidence
that
any
driver
was
arrested
because
he
or
she
was
under
the
influence
of
drugs
or
alcohol.
our
statistics
show
that
4.7
percent
of
the
drivers
stopped
possessed
some
sort
of
narcotics.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
no,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
different
than
the
hypotheticals
that
you
described
for
this
important
reason.
the
relationship
between
smuggling
drugs
in
cars,
of
course,
and
the
roadway
itself
is
close.
we
have
found
that,
obviously,
with
our
high
hit
rate
in
indianapolis.
carrying
drugs
in
cars
is
important
to
foster
the
drug
trade
in
our
neighborhoods,
both
in
terms
of
possession
amounts
and
smuggling
amounts,
traffic
amounts.
the
ease
with
which
the
drugs
can
be
concealed
and
moved
about
very
easily
and
enter
our
neighborhoods
is
a
problem.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
it
might
be,
your
honor,
if
that
connection
was
shown.
if
there
was
a
significant
connection
shown
by
the
government
in
that
case
between
that
rash
of
burglaries
or
whatever
the
crime
may
be
and
the
use
of
the
roadway,
that
would
be
perhaps
available.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
well,
certainly
if
you
have
a
lot
of
crime
in
the
neighborhood--
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
--probably
not,
your
honor.
certainly
a
substantial
connection
can
be
shown
in
this
case
and
was
shown
in
martinez-fuerte,
for
example.
the
court
can
easily
set
the
bar
at
that
substantial
connection
or
significant
connection
that
would
differentiate
between
stopping
cars
for
general
criminal
violations.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
it's
special,
your
honor,
because
here
the
car
is
used
as
an
instrumentality
to
secret
away
the
drugs
that
are
then
either...
have
been
just
purchased
in
a
neighborhood
or
may
be
on
their
way
to
a
neighborhood
for
sale.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
it
doesn't
tell
us
specifically,
your
honor.
what
the
record
does
tell
us
is
that
in
the
very
first
checkpoint
that
indianapolis
set
up
there
was
a
sizable
distribution
amount
that
was
seized
in
the
checkpoint,
but
our
checkpoints
are
designed
to
both
attack
the
supply
and
demand.
we
think
it's
important
to
attack
possession
amounts
as
well.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
our
case
would
be
as
strong
for
two
reasons.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
that's
correct.
it
tells
you
something
about
our
program,
but
it...
but
it
need...
we
need
not
have--
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
--distributing...
to
smuggle
drugs.
people
who
smuggle
drugs,
either
for
distribution
or
possession.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
for
these
checkpoints?
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
our...
our...
no.
we
have
three
interests
that
are
being
served
here.
the
drug
distribution
interest
is
primary,
and
we
conceded
that,
but
we
also,
and
the
record
shows
this
indisputably,
check
for
signs
of
impairment.
so
we
are
interested
in
catching
drivers
who
are
under
the
influence
of
drugs
or
alcohol.
and
thirdly,
we
check
drivers'
license
and
registrations
at
each
checkpoint.
in
fact,
that's
the
first
thing
that
the
officers
do
at
the
checkpoints,
and
we
had
a
measurable,
a
sizable
hit
rate
for
driving
violations
as
well.
it
was
essentially
equal
to
our
narcotics
hit
rate,
and
both
were
higher
than
this
court
sustained
in
sitz.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
pedestrian
stops
present
a
different
case,
your
honor,
for
several
reasons.
one,
this
court
certainly
hasn't
applied,
for
example,
the
brown
balancing
test
to--
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
--well,
i
believe
because
the
degree
of
intrusion
and
one's
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
pedestrian
context
is
simply
higher
or
different
than
in
the
motorist
context.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
well,
the
court
certainly
has
recognized
for
some
time,
for
75
years
perhaps
since
carroll,
that
motorists
enjoy
a
diminished
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
again,
i
think
there
are
some
differences,
your
honor,
between
the
pedestrian
context
and
the
motorist
context.
certainly
there
is
that
expectation
of
freedom
of
movement,
of
liberty
interest
that
is
different
between
cars
and
pedestrians.
pedestrians
are
much
less
regulated
certainly
than
cars,
much
less
used
to
the
government
telling
them
that
they
have
to
stop.
pedestrians
can
stop
at
their
own
will
and
proceed
down
the
street
and
window
shop
in
a
way
that
cars
cannot
certainly.
cars
have
to
be
traveling
at
speeds
dictated
by
the
government
in
a
direction
that's
dictated
by
the
government,
cannot
change
lanes
unless
they
do
it
in
a
way
that
the
government
has
told
them
they
can.
so--
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
--i
think
in
this
case
the
expectation
is
a
freedom
of
movement
because
here
no
searches
are
undertaken
without
probable
cause,
so
really
what
we're
talking
about
in
this
case
and
all
respondents
have
ever
challenged
about
this
case
is
the
initial
stop
of
the
car.
so
the
point
is
merely
that
because
people
in
cars,
motorists
are
used
to
being
stopped,
even
at
the
behest
of
the
government
for
any
number
of
different
reasons.
it's
that
expectation
that
makes
these
checkpoints
in
this
case
the
same
as
the
checkpoints
that
the
court
has
upheld
in
martinez
fuerte
and
sitz
reasonable
under
the
circumstances.
that's
simply
different
than
the
pedestrian
context.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
i
think
it's
inherently
part
of
the
brown
balancing
test,
as
this
court
applied
it
in
sitz,
for
example,
it
measures
in
the
third
element
of
the
brown
test
the
degree
of
intrusion
on
motorists.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
i
think
the
point
remains
that
cars
are
stopped
in
any
number
of
different
contexts,
even
at
the
government's
direction,
and
so
it's
reasonable
for
the
court
to
conclude
that
that
is
a...
presents
a
lesser
degree
of
intrusion
than
the
pedestrian
context.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
it
is
reasonable
to
stop
a
car
because
of,
again,
the
connection
between
the
activity
that's
sought
to
be
regulated
here
and
the
roadway.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
again,
we
think
that
the
court
could
look
to
the
substantial
connection
between
drugs
and
their
trafficking
and
possession
on
the
roadways.
if
the
court
is
not
convinced
that
that
presents
a
significantly
different
context
than
the
pedestrian
situation,
then
of
course
you
could
apply
brown
in
that
context.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
yes,
the
court
found
on
balance
the
degree
of
intrusion
was
not...
did
not
outweigh
the
government's
interests
in
that
case,
and
that
since
martinez
fuerte,
like
the
case
here,
is
a
smuggling
case.
there
the
fear
was
that
persons
or
motorists
were
smuggling
illegal
aliens
in
their
cars,
and
the
court
thought
it
sufficient
that
a
program
of
the
neutral
seizures
at
a
checkpoint
guarded
against
arbitrariness
and
did
not
outweigh
the
intrusion
caused
by--
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
--let
me
say
a
few
things
about
that
if
i
can,
your
honor.
first,
that
was
not
part
of
the
court's
decision
in
martinez
fuerte.
these
were
stops
of
persons
that
there
was
no
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
had
just
crossed
the
border.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
yes,
it
was
a
factor
in
the
case,
your
honor,
but
it
didn't
appear
critical
to
the
court's
holding,
nor
did
the
united
states
argue
that
that
case
is
sufficiently
different
from
our
case.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
if
a
particular
government
program
was
not
successful,
certainly,
that
is
one
check
against
that
sort
of
checkpoint
as
well.
the
second
element
of
the
brown
balancing
test
requires
essentially
that
the
programs
serve
the
governmental
interests
at
stake,
and
so
a
program
that
didn't
do
very
well
certainly
wouldn't
survive
this
court's
fourth
amendment
scrutiny.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
i
think
it's...
i
think
it's
both,
your
honor.
we
clearly
have
articulated
in
this
case
a
substantial
interest
in
interdicting
drugs.
respondents
haven't
really
challenged
that
as
an
important
interest,
and
it's
an
interest
that
this
court
has
upheld
on
many
occasions.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
it
would
be
weaker,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
although
probably--
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
--well,
we
knew
that
we
had
a
problem.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
well,
we
certainly
knew
we
had
a
problem,
and
our
program
actually
proved
that
we
were
correct.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
it's
not
for
a
couple
reasons.
first,
that
case
was
for
that
quote,
and
that
case
was
talking
about
searches,
and
of
course
we
don't
search
anyone
here.
we
engage
in
a
pattern
of
brief
roadway
seizures.
and
secondly,
this
court's
decisions
in
martinez
fuerte
and
sitz
and
its
suggestion
in
delaware
versus
prouse
shows
there
are
any
number
of
things
that
a
court...
that
a
government
can...
interests
that
can
be
served
by
a
checkpoint
program.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'll
reserve
my
remaining
time.
thank
you.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
first
clear
up
from
our
perspective
one
of
justice
breyer's
concerns
about
what
is
the
primary
purpose
or
what
are
the
purposes
in
this
case.
it's
clearly
true
that
indianapolis
has
wanted
to
primarily
emphasize
drug
detection
in
these
checkpoints,
but
it's
also
clear
that
we
had
three
interests
being
served.
it's
clear
in
the
record.
we
were
so
interested,
in
fact,
in
driver's
license
and
registration
checks
being
performed
in
this
very
set
of
checkpoints
that
4.2
percent
of
the
motorists
stopped
in
these
checkpoints
were
arrested
for
traffic
violations.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
it's
not
clear
from
the
record
whether
we
do,
your
honor.
i
know
certainly
that
we
do
in
indianapolis
sobriety
checkpoints
quite
all
the
time.
i'm
not
sure
about
driver's
license
and
registration
checkpoints
apart
from
sobriety
or
drug
checkpoints,
but
we're
clearly
interested
in
all
three
of
these
interests
being
served.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
yes,
the
signs...
the
signs
display
what
our
area
of
emphasis
is
for
those
checkpoints,
which
is
narcotics
detection
checkpoint
ahead
so
many
miles,
one
mile,
half
a
mile,
canine
in
use.
be
prepared
to
stop.
that's
what
the
sign
said.
mr.
a.
scott
chinn
well,
mr.
falk
is
certainly
correct,
the
record
isn't
absolutely
clear
on
that.
my
understanding
is
that
the
dogs
do
their
work
very
quickly.
we're
only
talking
about
five
to
ten
cars
in
a
sequence,
and
the
dog
is
led
around
each
car
really
in
a
matter
of
seconds.
so
it's
my
understanding
in
almost
all
situations
the
dog
will
be
done
with
its
work.
