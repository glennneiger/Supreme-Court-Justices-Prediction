justice
david
h.
souter
i
suppose
given
the
fact
that
you
don't
have
a
record
with
respect
to
finding
actual
impairment
among
the
people
that
you
stop,
i
suppose
that
if
we
sustain
the
search
here,
we
would
be
required
to
do
the
same
thing
if
you
made
a
facial
showing
that
in
a
given
neighborhood
drug
distribution
was
done
on
foot.
i
suppose
you
would
be
able
to
stop
pedestrians
again
on
a
sort
of
a
random
basis
according
to
some
set
of
criteria
like
this
and
question
every
pedestrian.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
reason
that
it
is
is
that...
that
we...
we
have,
if
not
a
history,
at
least
some
experience
with...
with
motorist
checkpoints,
but
there
was
a
day
when
we
didn't.
it
had
to
start
somewhere,
and
i
don't
know
why
the
same
reasoning
couldn't
be
applied
to
pedestrians
and
start
somewhere
there,
and
after
a
while
we'd
have
a
tradition
of
stopping
pedestrians
on
the
street,
too.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
the
original
rationale
for
that
was
that
because
the
person
was
in
a
car,
the
person
could
get
away
easily,
and
yet
that
rationale
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
rationale
that...
that
you're
advancing
here
to
justify
this
stop.
your...
your
rationale
for
stopping
cars
is
that
people
use
cars
to
distribute
drugs,
and
my
suggestion
is
that
in
a
given
area
if
people
distribute
drugs
on
foot,
the
same
rationale
that
would
justify
what
you're
doing
here
would
justify
pedestrian
stops,
and
the
original
carroll
justification
for
an
automobile
exception
so-called
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
either
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
the
same
result
then
would
be
for
pedestrian
checkpoints?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
should
there
be?
in
other
words,
the
rationale
that
you're
advancing
and
that
your
brother
has
been
advancing
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
make
any
particular
sense
of
that
distinction.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if...
if
martinez-fuerte
can
be
applied
as
you
have
said
to
justice
scalia
that
it
may
be
applied
in
indianapolis
or
the
middle
of
nebraska
somewhere
because
there
is...
there
is
a...
a...
a
general
basis
in
the
evidence
prior
to
the
search
operation,
that
there
is
a
high
incidence
of
illegal
aliens,
then
to
begin
with
judge
posner's
rationale
has
nothing,
i
guess,
to
do...
much
to
do
with
the
case,
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
have
anything...
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
key
to
the
use
of
automobiles,
and
therefore
i
don't
see
why,
if
we
accept
your
answer
to
justice
scalia,
we
are
not
well
down
the
road
toward
pedestrian
checkpoints.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then,
on...
excuse
me...
on
that
theory
could
the
police
station
drug
detection
dogs
at
every
street
crossing
where
the
traffic
lights
require
pedestrians
to
wait
until
the
yellow
light
comes
along?
the
pedestrians
are
being
stopped
in
the
normal
manner
in
which
pedestrian
traffic
is
regulated.
the
dog
is
no
more
intrusive
than
the
dog
is
when
it
goes
around
the
car.
could
the
police
do
that
and
have
a
good
search?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
if
somebody
says
to
the
dog,
you
know,
get
away
from
me,
the
police
can
say,
no,
you've
got
to
let
the
dog
search
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
isn't
it
a
seizure
of
the
car
for
something
other
than
the
purposes
of
checking
license
plates
when
the
dog
goes
around
the
car?
are
you
telling...
or
maybe
your
answer
would
be
that
the
driver
of
the
car
can
say
to
the
police,
get
the
dog
away
from
the
car.
and
the
police
would
have
to
do
it.
would
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
have
a
legitimate
basis
for
stopping
the
pedestrian
until
the
light
turns
yellow.
the
pedestrian
is
just
as
validly
stopped
as
the
car
is
for
the
driver's
license
check.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
the
pedestrian
can
tell
the
police
to
get
the
dog
away,
why
can't
the
car
owner?
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
take
an
easy
case
in
which
there
is
simply
a
history
in
indianapolis
or
any
other
jurisdiction
of
license
roadblock
checks,
and
after
25
years
of
doing
this,
suddenly
one
day
a
drug
sniffing
dog
appears
at
the
license
check.
would
you
find
anything
constitutionally
suspect
in
the
use
of
the
dog
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
let's...
you're
talking
about
seizure.
let's
assume
that
the
dog
simply
sniffs,
if
it
sniffs
at
all,
during
the
time
in
which
it
takes
to
look
at
the
license
so
that
there
is
no...
there
is
no
greater
imposition
upon
the
driver
by
the
use
of
the
dog.
would
that
raise
a
constitutional
suspicion?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
the
example
that
i
gave
you,
the
assumption
that
i
was
making
or
implying
by
the
hypo
was
that
the
license
check
remained,
in
fact,
a
bona
fide
license
check.
it
had
been
so
before
dogs
arrived,
it
continued
to
be
so
after
the
dog
arrived.
if
you
make
that
assumption,
that
in
fact
there
is
a
bona
fide
license
check
being
made
for
the
ostensible
purpose,
that
of
checking
licenses,
does
the
addition
of
the
dog
raise
a
constitutional
suspicion?
justice
david
h.
souter
does
it
raise
it
for
any
other
reason
than
it
raises
a
question
as
to
whether
they
are
still
really
looking
for
licenses?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
can
understand...
i
guess
i
can
understand
your
argument.
you
say,
hey,
look,
when
the
dog
appears,
we
all
know
that
they
are
no
longer
interested
in
licenses,
they
are
interested
in
something
else.
they
are
doing
just
what
they
are
doing
here.
that
argument
i
can
understand.
but
if
you
assume,
if
it
were
proved,
if
it
were
found
as
a
fact
by
a
reviewing
court
that
the
license
check
was
still
a
bona
fide
purpose,
that's
where
i
have
trouble
with
your
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
rationale
that
i
think
you
started
to
add
up
right
there
for
the
reason
for
the
purpose
inquiry.
if
i
understood
what
you
were
saying
is,
i
think
you
were
implying
that
in
cases
like
martinez-fuerte
and
the
regular
driver's
checks,
the
question
of
purpose
was
not
in
the
case;
that
where
purpose
has
come
into
the
case,
as
justice
ginsburg
suggested,
we
have...
we
have
said
that
in
fact
purpose
is
a
crucial
inquiry.
and
i
understood
you
to
be
starting
to
say
that
if
you
don't
make
it
a
crucial
inquiry,
your
categories
simply
collapse
and
there
is
no
way,
in
effect,
to
stop,
as
you
said
in
your...
there
is
no
way
to
stop
short
of
pedestrian
search.
can
you
elaborate
on
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
this
comes
back
to
your
purpose
argument.
you're
basically
saying
that
justice
scalia's
premise
cannot
be
accepted
in
those
circumstances.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you're
saying
that
because
purpose
is
crucial,
we
characterize
it
this
way
as
the
drug
search.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
tough
question,
and
i
think
this
is
consistent
with
his
question,
what
if
we
assume,
it
is
found
as
a
fact
by
the
reviewing
court
that
the
license
check
or
the
registration
check
is,
in
fact,
a
genuine,
bona
fide
purchase...
purpose,
and
they
simply
add
the
dog?
they're
saying,
look,
if
we're
stopping
them
for
this
legitimate
purpose
anyway,
why
not
check
for
this,
too?
why
not
let
the
dog
go
around?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
does
the
dog
taint
the
search
in
that
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
is
the
reason
of
the
beyond
the
scope
criterion
essentially
a
slippery
slope
reason?
are
you,
in
effect,
saying
that
my
premise
is
really
an
unsupportable
premise?
because
if
you
accept
that
premise,
everybody's
going
to
wink
and
say,
we're
just
checking
for
licenses,
and
we
happen
to
have
this
dog
here,
and...
and
that
the...
that
the
premise,
in
fact,
will
never...
or
will...
the
threat
that
the
premise
will
not
be
true,
that
it
will
not
be
a
bona
fide
purpose
is
just
too
great,
and
that's
why
you
don't
let
the
dog--
justice
david
h.
souter
--oh,
i
realize
that.
i'm
pursuing...
i'm
just
pursuing
the
limits
of
your
argument
as
justice
scalia--
justice
david
h.
souter
and
what's
the
danger
that
you
perceive
in
making
the
distinction
between
the
individual
and
the
programmatic?
why
do
you
make
that
distinction?
why
do
you
say
there
can't
be
a
programmatic
rem?
