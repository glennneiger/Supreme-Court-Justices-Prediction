justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
using
the
expectation.
it's
just...
it's
much
more...
it's
reasonable
to
stop
cars
very
often,
very
often
for
checks,
you
know,
all
the
things
that
people
have
said
in
prior
cases.
but
the
difficulty
with
your
case
is
it
doesn't
seem
any
more
reasonable
to
stop
a
car
just
to
look
for
evidence
of
a
crime
in
general
than
it
does
to
stop
a
pedestrian
to
look
for
evidence
of
a
crime
in
general.
and
what
you
haven't
done,
at
least
i
haven't
heard
you
do,
is
to
say
why
there's
something
special
about
this
that
would
really
justify
stopping
the
car
any
more
than
it
would
justify
stopping
a
pedestrian.
so
what
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
when
we
go
back
to
justice
ginsburg
who
made
the
point
very
well,
look,
people
sometimes
rob
banks
on
foot.
bank
robbers
perhaps
are
poor,
they
can't
afford
cars.
they
walk
around.
and
that
happens
a
certain
number
of
times.
so
do
we
stop
all
the
pedestrians?
i
mean,
you
heard
her
question.
my
problem
is,
i
can't
find
anything
special
about
being
in
a
car
in
respect
to
a
general
search
without
suspicion
that
there's
any
special
crime
but
just
a
general
effort
to
stop
crime,
and
i
haven't
heard
you
present
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
a
policeman
could
walk
a
dog,
a
sniffing
dog
down
the
street,
couldn't
he?
i
mean,
suppose
he
did
that.
there
are
people
stopped,
i
mean,
so
it
doesn't
bother
anybody,
but
he
sniffs
the
dog.
i
thought
probably
that
was
lawful.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
would
like
you
to
address
that
particular
point.
i'm
confused.
my
characterization,
not
theirs.
but
from
what
mr.
chinn
said,
i
thought
that
this
was
a
stop
the
basic
purpose
of
which
was
to
look
for
drugs;
i.e.,
if
the
police
had
known
they
weren't
going
to
get...
be
able
to
look
for
drugs,
there
would
have
been
no
stop.
from
what
the
solicitor
general
said,
i
thought
that
my
characterization,
not
hers,
that
this
was
a
different
kind
of
stop.
this
was
a
stop
to
search
for
drunk
drivers
or
a
stop
to
search
for
licenses...
unlicensed
drivers,
and
the
police
would
have
done
it
if
drugs
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
it,
and
their
having
done
this
is
like
somebody
stopping
at
a
red
light,
and
people
walk
a
dog
around.
well,
there
seems
to
be
quite
different
considerations.
so
what
is
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that
isn't
my
point.
my
point
is,
have
the
police
set
this
up
to
look
for
drugs
and
in
the
absence
of
their
ability
to
do
that,
they
wouldn't
have
set
it
up,
wouldn't
have
stopped
people?
or
is
it
a
search
that
the
police
set
up
to
look
for
no
licenses
and
alcohol?
and
if
you
had
told
them
you
can't
look
for
drugs,
they
would
have
done
it
anyway?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
when
you
say
it's
a
search
to
look
for
drugs,
and
the
solicitor
general
says
it
isn't,
it's
a
search
for...
how
am
i
going
to
find
out
who
is
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
did
they
concede
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
does
primary
purpose
mean
in
the
absence
of
their
ability
to
do
that,
they
wouldn't
have
done
it;
i.e.,
it
was
a
necessary
condition
for
the
stop?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
about
bringing
a
witness,
just
bringing
a
witness
to
look
at
somebody
stopped
at
a
stoplight?
i
mean,
people
do
things
like
this
all
the
time.
you
stop
them
for
one
purpose,
but
what
the
policeman
does
doesn't
hurt
them
in
any
way
whatsoever.
it's
just
a
way
of
getting
a
witness
or
somebody
to...
you're
pursuing
this
line
of
i
guess
assuming
that
this
was
a
stop
that
was
done
for
a
legitimate
other
purpose,
and
i'm
having
trouble
following
that
assumption.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
does
secondary
mean?
to
me
secondary
meant
that
they
never
would
have
done
this
thing
if
it
weren't
for
the
primary
purpose.
that's
what
i
thought
it
was
and
now
i'm
a
little
mixed
up
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
they
have
any
other
places
in
the
city
where
they
stop
people
for
checking
for
licenses?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
they
have
any
other
places
in
the
city
in
the
same
way
where
they
stop
people
for
drunk
driving
with
these
same
kinds
of
checks?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
you
say
yes,
but
until
i
heard
the
solicitor
general,
frankly,
i
thought
that
just
like
the
first
of
the
cases
you're
talking
about
was
an
immigration
case
and
the
second
case
was
a
drunk
search.
this
was
a
drug
search.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
lower
courts
have
treated
it
this
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
indianapolis
had
said
any
other
purpose
was
secondary.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
suddenly
since
the
solicitor
general
argued,
i
think
there
is
a
new
premise
reaching
in...
reaching
in.
this
is
not
a
drug
search
case.
this
is
a
drunk
search
plus
a
dog.
now,
that's
quite
a
different
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
because
of
that
issue,
i
think
it's
important
to
get
clear
on
what
it
is,
and
if
we're
treating
it
as
a
drug
case,
it's
one
thing.
drunk
case
plus
a
dog,
it's
another.
so
in
your
last
answer,
you
accepted
the
characterization.
the
second
characterization.
and
i
want
to
be
sure
what
you
think
about
that
and
why
i
take
it
you
think
it
should
be
the
first
characterization,
not
the
second.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
do
you
ever
do
other
similar
traffic,
any
registration
checks
without
the
drugs?
