justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
have
just
one
question
about
that.
i
guess
on
the
checkpoints
to
check
for
drunk
drivers,
that's
at
least
related
to
the
condition
of
the
driver
of
the
car,
and
the
court
applied
a
balancing
test
and
upheld
it.
now,
is
this
search
more
to
find
drugs
being
transported
in
vehicles
or
is
it
looking
for
drivers
who
are
impaired
by
drug
use?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
does
that
make
this
akin
to
a
checkpoint,
for
instance,
to
catch
burglars
in
an
area
or
a
murderer
or
something
of
that
kind?
is
this
more
for
typical
law
enforcement
purposes?
and
does
that
affect
the
balance
in
some
way?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
there
were
a
high
crime
area
with
lots
of
thefts
and
burglaries
and
it
was
believed
that
the
burglars
typically
made
their
getaway
in
cars,
is
it
appropriate
to
have
roadblocks
and
check
people
for
that
purpose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
drunk
driving.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
driving
while
impaired
by
drug
use?
if
that
were
the
purpose,
okay?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
courts
below
find
there
were
these
other
purposes
in
addition?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
falk,
i
want
to
get
into
this
same
area
with
you
because
as
i
read
sitz
and
martinez-fuerte,
this
court
didn't
look
at
purpose
at
all.
we
have
spent
most
of
the
morning
here
talking
about
purpose,
what
was
the
purpose.
that
wasn't
the
analysis.
the
court
just
went
to
balancing.
what
does
the
government
need
and
how
closely
does
the
checkpoint
serve
that
need?
and
we
totally
obviated
the
need
to
look
for
purpose,
so
i'm
not
sure
that
these
discussions
have
helped
the
analysis
that
much.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
we
have
recognized
special
needs
as
an
exception
to
the
individualized
suspicion,
and
we've
recognized
those
special
needs
in
the
automobile
context.
and
it
is
certainly
arguable,
i
guess,
that
because
the
state
licen...
or
the...
because
the
state
licenses
the
driver
and
because
motor
vehicles
are
deadly
weapons
potentially
that
the
state
has
a
special
need
of
assuring
that
the
people
who
are
driving
are
licensed
and
are
not
impaired
by
drugs
or
alcohol.
and
maybe
there's
a
special
need
there
that
can
be
met
by
occasional
checkpoints.
is
that
unreasonable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
doesn't
translate
to
pedestrians
at
all.
we
are
dealing
with
licensing
somebody
to
use
this
potentially
lethal
vehicle.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
then
it
boils
down
to
whether
there
is
any
increase
in
intrusion
by
having
the
dog
sniff.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
in
august
1998,
the
city
of
indianapolis
started
a
highway
checkpoint
program.
the
primary
purpose
of
the
program
is
the
interdiction
of
illegal
narcotics.
the
party
stipulated
in
the
case
that
the
checkpoints
were
being
conducted
in
accordance
with
written
guidelines,
under
which
the
police
stop
a
predetermined
number
of
vehicles
at
each
checkpoint.
an
officer
informs
the
driver,
that
the
driver
is
being
stopped
at
a
drug
checkpoint,
and
asked
for
the
license
and
registration
of
the
vehicle.
the
officer
looks
for
signs
of
impairment
and
examines
the
vehicle
from
the
outside.
a
narcotics
detection
dog
walks
around
the
outside
of
the
vehicle.
the
city
conducted
six
of
these
drug
roadblocks
between
august
and
november
1998,
stopping
over
1100
vehicles
and
arresting
approximately
9%
of
the
motorists
stopped.
roughly
half
the
arrests
were
for
drug
related
offenses.
the
respondents
filed
a
class
action
suit
after
being
stopped
at
one
of
these
checkpoints.
the
district
court
denied
a
preliminary
injunction.
a
divided
panel
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed,
holding
that
the
checkpoints
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
seventh
circuit.
in
michigan
department
of
state
police
versus
sitz,
we
approved
a
sobriety
vehicle
checkpoint
for
the
purpose
of
combating
drunk
driving.
in
united
states
versus
martinez-fuerte,
we
approved
vehicle
checkpoints
near
the
mexican
border
for
the
purpose
of
intercepting
illegal
immigrants.
these
cases
are
examples
of
limited
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
that
a
search
or
seizure
is
ordinarily
unreasonable
in
the
absence
of
individualized
suspicion
of
wrongdoing.
considerations
specifically
related
to
the
need
to
police
national
borders
were
significant
factor
in
the
martinez-fuerte
decision.
in
sitz,
there
was
a
close
connection
between
the
imperative
of
roadway
safety
and
the
law
enforcement
practice
at
issue.
likewise,
we
suggested
in
the
case
of
delaware
versus
prouse,
that
a
state
could
constitutionally
set
up
a
roadblock
for
checking
licenses
and
registrations
of
the
vehicle
in
order
to
serve
the
violent
for
sub-highway
safety.
we
distinguished
roadway
safety
interest
from
the
general
interest
in
crime
control.
the
petitioners
concede
and
the
evidence
shows
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
checkpoints
in
this
case
is
to
interdict
illegal
narcotic
drugs.
this
purpose
is
ultimately
indistinguishable
from
the
general
interest
in
crime
control.
as
a
result
we
hold
that
the
indianapolis
drug
checkpoint
program
violates
the
fourth
amendment.
a
low
traffic
in
illegal
narcotics
create
social
harms
of
the
first
magnitude.
the
gravity
of
the
threat
alone
could
not
be
dispositive
of
what
means
law
enforcement
officers
may
use
to
pursue
a
given
end.
our
holding
today
is
limited
to
checkpoints
whose
primary
purpose
is
general
crime
control.
it
does
not
address
other
programatic
searches
or
seizures,
aimed
primarily
at
purposes
beyond
the
general
interest
in
crime
control.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
joins
and
in
which
justice
scalia
joins
as
to
part
1
i
believe;
justice
thomas
has
also
filed
the
dissenting
opinion.
