what
do
the
statistics
show
or
do
they
show
about
the
percentage
of
people
that
were
arrested
that
were
using
drugs
and
were
therefore
driving
under
the
influence
of
drugs?
do
the
statistics
show
us
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
even
so,
it's
somewhat
circular.
i
mean,
if
we
say
there
is
no
expectation,
then
there
is
going
to
be
no
expectation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
case
that
everybody
begins
with
in
automobile
searches
is
carroll,
the
prohibition
case,
and
the
chief
justice
in
that
case
writing
it
said
it
would
be
intolerable
and
unreasonable
if
a
prohibition
agent
were
authorized
to
stop
every
automobile
on
the
chance
of
finding
liquor
and
thus
subject
all
persons
lawfully
using
the
highway
to
the
inconvenience
and
indignity
of
such
a
search.
that's
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
city
council
authorized
this
search
and
had
a
preamble
and
said,
in
order
to
interdict
drug
distributors,
we
are
setting
up
the
following
checkpoint,
and
then
the
case
is
just
like
it
is,
and
you
have
a
license,
they
say
that
the
sole...
the
purpose
is
to
interdict
drug
smuggling.
does
that
change
the
case
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
reality
of
police
work
is
that
the
police
enforce
all
of
the
laws.
suppose
there
were
a
driver's
license
checkpoint
as
stipulated
by
justice...
hypothesized
by
justice
souter,
and
the
police
said
now
we
want
to
add
the
people,
the
officers
manning
this
license
checkpoint
who
are
experts
in
drug
detection.
would
there
be
something
constitutionally
suspicious
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
they're
trained
especially
to
look
at
people's
eyes
and
to
smell
and
to
look
at
the
kinds
of
containers
they
can
see
in
plain
view,
this
is
to
normal
police
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
if
that's
permissible,
what's
not
permissible
about
adding
the
dog?
because
the
dog's
more
efficient?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
i
may
add,
this
is
exactly
what
the
court
said,
this
is
what
justice
o'connor's
point
is.
this
is
exactly
what
the
court
said
in
sitz.
we
don't
need
martinez-fuerte,
not
because
there
is
a
difference
between
a
regulatory
stop
and
a
stop
for
probable
cause,
but
because
it's
a
car
involved.
that's
the
way
i
read
sitz.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
want
us
to
use
the
von
raab
analysis
and
in
sitz
we
said
when
you
have
automobiles
you
don't,
you
use
the
martinez-fuerte
analysis.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
allow
a
dog
in
a
martinez-fuerte
stop?
