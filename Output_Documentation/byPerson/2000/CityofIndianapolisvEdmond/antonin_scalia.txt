justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there's
always
such
a
connection.
i
know
very
few
burglars
that
go
on
foot.
i
mean,
you're
saying
yes,
then.
you're
answering
the
question
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
stop
all
cars
to
see
if
they
have
burglary
tools?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
the
connection
between
burglars,
who
usually
get
where
they're
going
by
car,
not
as
close
as
the
connection
with
drug
traffickers,
who
usually
engage
in
their
business
by
car?
i
mean,
everybody
almost
usually
does
everything
by
car.
it
seems
to
me
i
don't
see
anything
special
about
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
i've
never
heard
the
concept
of
expectation
of
privacy
which
has
been
applied
to...
to
searches
applied
to
seizures,
which
is
what
you're
now
saying.
you're
saying
there's
no
reasonable
expectation
of
not
being
seized,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
of
any
of
our
cases
that
ever
applied
that
reasoning
to
seizures?
i
mean,
after
all,
you
have
to
stop
for
a
traffic
light.
you
have
to
stop
for,
you
know,
bridges
that
are
up
and
all
sorts
of
things,
so
you
say,
you
expect
to
be
stopped
or
seized
by
government
order
frequently
while
you're
in
a
car,
and
therefore
you
have
no
right
not
to
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
expectation
of
being
stopped.
i
mean,
this
is
just
a
novel,
a
novel
approach
to
me,
to
use
the
expectation
rationale
with
respect
to
seizures
as
opposed
to
searches.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
think
you
could
stop...
police
can
stop
cars
anywhere
in
the
united
states
just
to
look
for
smuggled
immigrants?
just
stop
the
car
and
say,
you
know,
can
i
see
your
papers,
please?
that's
sort
of
scary.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
follow
up
on
the
indianapolis
hypothetical.
why
would
it
have
to
be
alien
smuggling?
i
mean,
why
couldn't
you
simply
identify
an
area
that
has
a
large...
you
know
that
there
are
a
large
number
of
illegal
aliens
in
this
section
of
indianapolis
that
is
largely
hispanic,
so
you
simply
set
up
roadblocks,
and
i'll
bet
you
you'll
get
a
pretty
good
catch
if
you
stop
every
car
that
drives
down
the
street
in
that
section
to
see
if
there
are
illegal
aliens
in
the
car.
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
we
know
in
the
facts
of
this
case
whether
the
dog
sniffing
occurs
while
the
license
check
is
going
on
or
whether
the
policeman
first
checks
the
license
and
then
says,
okay,
now
stay
here,
i'm
done
checking
your
license,
but
i
want
to
walk
around
the
car
with
a
police
dog?
justice
antonin
scalia
please,
finish
your
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
a
driver
without
a
driver's
license,
is
that
a
safety
concern?
do
you
acknowledge
that
it's
okay
to
make
the
stops
to
see
that
the
person
behind
the
wheel
has
a
driver's
license?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine.
let's
assume
that
that
is
so
justified
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
difference
does
it
make
that
in
the
course
of
that
search,
in
the
course
of
that
stop
the
police
also
send
a
dog
around
the
car?
i
mean,
in
the
case
of
individualized
traffic
stops,
we
have
innumerable
cases
where
the
person
who
was
caught
with
drugs
in
his
car
after
a
stop
for
a
broken
taillight
and
in
the
course
of
interrogating
the
driver
about
the
broken
taillight,
the
policeman
sees
something
suspicious,
and
then
conducts
a
full
search.
and
it
is
often
alleged
and
may
well
be
true
that
the
reason
the
policeman
stopped
the
car
with
the
broken
taillight
was
that
this
car
looked
suspicious
and
he
thought
it
might
have
drugs
in
it,
and
we
have
simply
rejected
that
argument.
we've
said
we're
not
going
to
go
into
the
subjective
motivation
of
the
individual
policeman.
so
long
as
he
had
a
valid
basis
for
stopping
the
car,
that's
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
why
shouldn't
that
apply
in
gross,
just
as
it
applies
with
respect
to
individual
traffic
stops?
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
there
is
cause.
you've
acknowledged
that
it
is
okay
to
stop
to
check
for
driver's
licenses.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
assuming
they're
not
going
beyond
what's
allowed.
they're
only
stopping
to
check...
now
their
real
purpose
is
to
find
drugs,
but
they're
only
stopping
the
cars
as
long
as
it
takes
to
check
for
driver's
licenses.
justice
antonin
scalia
while
they
do
that
the
dog
sniffs
around
the
car.
justice
antonin
scalia
officers
with
really
sharp
noses
would
be
okay?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
falk,
i
don't
understand
why
it
makes
any
difference
whether
the
city
would
have
done
this
otherwise.
why
does
it
make
any
difference
in
this
case?
it
surely
makes
no
difference
when
a
defendant
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
drug
offense
comes
in
and
says,
the
policeman
who
stopped
my
car,
oh,
yes,
he
stopped
it
because
of
a
defective
brake
light,
but
that's
not
really
what
he
was
after.
and
we
don't
inquire
as
to
whether
that's
really
what
he
was
after,
and
i
frankly
personally
believe
that
very
often
that
isn't
what
he
was
really
after,
that
he
stopped
this
suspicious
looking
car
which
happened
to
have
a
defective
brake
light.
now,
we
just
don't
listen
to
that
argument.
we
don't
care
what
the
primary
subjective
purpose
was.
why
should
we
care
here
so
long
as
they
have
authority
to
stop
for
the
driver's
licenses
and
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
stop
is
driver's
licenses,
what
difference
does
it
make
that
they
have
another
motive?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
is
wrong
about
the
city
saying,
look,
we
have
a
right
to
stop
people,
to
look
at
their
licenses?
police
forces
do
this
all
the
time
in
fairfax
county.
they
stop
to
make
sure
you
paid
your
vehicle
tax.
why
don't
we
do
that,
and
in
the
course
of
doing
it
have
a
dog
sniff
around
the
car?
in
fact,
their
primary
purpose
may
be
to
have
the
dog
sniff
around
the
car,
but
they
are
conducting
a
stop
that
is
a
perfectly
legitimate
stop,
and
we
don't
look
into
purpose.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm
not...
i'm
not
assuming
a
mixed
motive.
i'm
hypothesizing
that
they
wanted
to
get
people
carrying
drugs,
and
the
means
of
doing
it,
they
said
we
have
a
perfect
right
to
stop
cars
in
order
to
look
at
licenses,
and
why
don't
we
do
that,
and
while
the
cars
are
stopped,
send
a
dog
around
the
car.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
isn't
a
criminal
investigatory
seizure.
it's
a
seizure
to
look
at
their
licenses.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
falk,
i
asked
miss
millett
earlier
whether
the
dogs
ever
took
longer
than
the
license
check,
and
she
said
no,
that
the
license
check
takes
three
to
five
minutes,
and
the
dog's
done
by
the
time
the
license
check...
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
your...
what
is
your
take
on
whether...
whether
you
have
to
wait
after
your
driver's
license
has
been
checked
for
the
dog
to
complete
sniffing?
do
we
know
about
that?
