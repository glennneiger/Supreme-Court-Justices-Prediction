each
of
the
plaintiffs
in
these
cases
is
an
alien
who
is
a
lawful
permanent
resident
of
the
united
states,
but
is
deportable
because
he
pleaded
guilty
to
a
criminal
offense.
at
the
time
of
each
of
the
guilty
pleas,
federal
law
provided
that
the
alien
could
apply
to
the
attorney
general
for
a
discretionary
waiver
of
deportation.
literally,
thousands
of
such
discretionary
waivers
had
been
granted
in
the
years
prior
to
1996,
when
congress
enacted
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act
and
the
illegal
immigration
reform
and
immigrant
responsibility
act.
as
the
government
construes
those
statutes,
they
withdrew
the
attorney
general’s
authority
to
grant
plaintiffs
the
waivers
that
were
available
when
they
agreed
to
plead
guilty.
moreover,
the
government
also
contends
that
procedural
provisions
in
those
statues
deprive
both
the
federal
district
courts
and
the
courts
of
appeals
of
jurisdiction
to
review
the
attorney
general’s
legal
conclusion
that
discretionary
relief
is
no
longer
available.
thus,
these
cases
raise
both
procedural
and
substantive
questions.
for
reasons
stated
in
opinions
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
answer
these
questions
the
same
way
that
the
court
of
appeals
did.
we
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
entertain
the
plaintiffs’
petitions
for
direct
review
of
the
decisions
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
but
that
the
district
court
does
have
jurisdiction
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
to
order
a
hearing
on
their
applications
for
a
discretionary
waiver.
on
the
merits
we
hold
that
the
repeal
of
the
attorney
general’s
authority
to
grant
discretionary
relief,
does
not
apply
to
aliens
who
pleaded
guilty
before
the
enactment
of
the
1966
legislation.
justice
scalia
has
filed
dissenting
opinions
that
are
joined
in
full
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
thomas,
and
in
part
by
justice
o’connor.
