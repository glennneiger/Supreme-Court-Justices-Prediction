unknown
speaker
--forum,
the
law
doesn't
apply
to
me
because
it
doesn't
take
effect
until
the
year
2004.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no.
just
say
that
this
whole
statute
doesn't
apply
to
me
because
the
whole
statute
doesn't
take
effect
until
2004.
it's
fanciful
in
this
circumstance
but
you
can
see
where
i
am
going.
unknown
speaker
would
you
need
habeas
corpus
to
review
those
things?
i
thought
they'd
be
reviewable
under
the
legislation?
unknown
speaker
things
are
covered
anyway?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
go
ahead.
with
respect
to
habeas
corpus,
it
is
not
at
all
the
case
that
congress
overlooked
even
in
section
1252
the
possibility
of
habeas
corpus
relief.
subsection
(a)(1)
of
section
1252
establishes
the
general
rule
of
court
of
appeals
review
but
it
specifically
carves
out
an
exception
for
situations
in
which
an
alien
is
in
expedited
removal
proceedings
and
as
to
that,
subsection
(e)
of
1252
specifically
provides
for
judicial
review
by
habeas
corpus.
so
congress
knew
when
to
provide
and
preserve
habeas
corpus
by
name
in
this
statute.
it
did
it
for
that
limited
category
and
did
it
in
no
other
and
1252(b)(9),
the
zipper
clause
says
that
unless
that
it's
specifically
provided
for
in
1252,
the
review
is
not
available.
and
if
there
could
be
any
doubt
as
i
mentioned
even
before
iirira,
congress
in
aedpa
had
repealed
the
provision
of
the
prior
judicial
review
provision
in
section
1105a(a)(10)
that
said
that,
provided
for
custody
review
of
aliens
of
their
deportation
orders,
that
that
was
specifically
eliminated.
so
congress
knew
very
well
what
it
was
doing
in
eliminating
habeas
corpus
as
such
but
providing
a
fully
adequate
substitute,
constitutionally
adequate
substitute
in
the
court
of
appeals,
something
that
this
court
said
in
swain
congress
can
do.
i
have
a
question
that
perhaps
the
statute
answers.
i
just
don't
have
it
clearly
in
mind.
if
there
had
not
been
the
provision,
the
specific
provision
for
habeas
in
the
accelerated
review
cases,
would
habeas
review
have
been
necessarily
postponed
in
those
cases
until
after
the
court
of
appeals
had
finished?
in
other
words,
i
guess
my
question
is
was
the
provision
for
habeas
review
in
the
accelerated
cases
in
effect
the
provision
of
kind
of
an
alternative
forum
that
otherwise
wouldn't
have
been
available
until
the
conclusion
of
the--
unknown
speaker
--the
current
law.
unknown
speaker
okay,
what
the
prior
law?
unknown
speaker
might
that
have
been
the
reason
for
the
specific
provision
under
the
new
law?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
the
competing
habeas
provision
in
this
period
of
uncertainty,
whether
you
could
go
to
both
places,
that
was
in
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
itself.
it
wasn't
1143,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't
the
general
habeas
statute.
unknown
speaker
that
wasn't
my
question.
my
question
was
you
referred
to,
wwas
it
11?
the
one
that
was
repealed?
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
and
so,
in
the
period
of
when
you
could
go
one
place
or
the
other,
wasn't
it
the
1105
that
was
used
to
get
into
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
could
you
just
advise
me,
is
it
the
attorney
general's
position,
the
justice
department's
position,
that
anybody
who
is
removable
under
this
statute
will
be
removed?
unknown
speaker
and
does
he
have
regulations
as
to
how
that,
what
is
the
present
position
is,
i
guess
my
question.
unknown
speaker
does
the
attorney
general
bring
removal,
removal
proceedings
under
anybody
that's
within
the
purview
of
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
would
you
clarify
one
thing?
you
said
that
there
is
no
more
discretion
under
the
new
statute,
but
you
just
answered
a
question
that
says
well
there
is
discretion,
but
it
goes
on
outside
the
statute.
the
attorney
general,
is
not
required,
even
with
knowledge
that
there
is
a
person
who
is
qualified
to
be
removed,
is
not
required
to
remove
anyone.
the
discretion
is
there
but
it's
kind
of
a
lawless
discretion.
is
that
what
you're
telling
us?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
you
were
asked.
you
said
there
aren't
any.
you
said
that--
unknown
speaker
--but
you're
not
aware
of
any?
unknown
speaker
just
in
case.
imagine
i've
read
this
and
it
reminds
me
of
these
brain
teasers
in
the
newspapers,
it's
very
complex.
and
suppose
after
i
got
through
reading
all
these
complex
arguments
technically
on
both
sides,
i
got
to
the
situation
where
i
thought
i
want
to
assume
congress
would
have
wanted
to
do
what
was
basically
fair
in
terms
of
retroactivity.
all
right.
then
i
thought
there'd
be,
what's
gone
is
the
attorney
general's
discretion
to
deal
with
a
sympathetic
case.
i've
thought
of
one.
a
man,
40,
45
years
old,
had
several
children,
the
bread-earner
of
the
family
when,
in
his
youth,
once
stole
a
pair
of
tennis
shoes
in
massachusetts...
an
aggravated
felony
under
this
statute,
i
think.
another
time,
on
another
occasion
he
stole
some
fruit
from
a
passing
train.
all
right?
now,
what
would
seem
to
be
the
fair
thing
is
at
least
you
give
him
a
shot
so
that
we
he
was
20
years
old
and
was
going
to
steal
the
fruit
from
the
train,
he
would
know
that
that
might
mean
deportation.
and
so,
if
we're
going
to
assume
congress
would
have
wanted
to
do
the
fair
thing,
why
wouldn't
we
assume
that
at
least
it
would
give
these
people
a
shot
so
that
the
second
time
they
know
the
likely
consequence.
hence,
we
would
apply
this
so
that
it
applies
to
people
whose
second
felony,
aggravated
felony
like
stealing
a
pair
of
tennis
shows,
i
say
slightly
sarcastically
but
it's
within
that,
i
think.
so
that
they'd
at
least
know
when
they
did
that
what's
going
to
happen.
well,
that's
what
i
call
the
basic--
unknown
speaker
--certainly
the
first
one
but
let's
say
the
second
one,
so
that
now
he
knows
what's
going
to
happen
and,
you
see,
that's
what
i
call....
now,
maybe
you
can't
even
get
to
that
because
you
go
through
all
the
technical
arguments.
we're
at
that
point.
is
there
any
answer?
is
there
any
answer
to
that
which
suggests
that
the
application
of
the
way
you're
doing
it,
and
indeed,
i
mean,
you
know,
you
go
pick
up
people
who
are
60
years
old.
they
have
families.
in
their
youth,
they
committed
a
few
indiscretions
and
without
any
hope
of
mercy
through
any
kind
of
discretion,
they're
gone.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
see
anything.
i
read
the
colloquy
and
i
didn't
see
anything
in
that
that
suggests
that
the
senators
who
were
for
this
provision
that
became
law
wouldn't
want
to
give
the
alien
at
least
the
knowledge
of
what
was
going
to
happen.
unknown
speaker
did
he
say
first
or
both?
unknown
speaker
did
he
say
first
or
both?
of
course
they
could
have
included
somebody
whose
first
crime
was
a
long
time
ago.
unknown
speaker
i
believe
the
court
also
said
in
landgraf
that
if
congress
hasn't
clearly
answered
the
question,
then
the
court,
taking
into
account
familiar
considerations
of
fair
notice,
reasonable
reliance,
settled
expectations
asks
whether
the
law
attaches
new
legal
consequences
to
events
completed
before
its
enactment.
now,
that
particular
phase
would
certainly
seem
satisfied
here.
unknown
speaker
with
a
new
legal
consequence
to
the
second
theft
of
the
tennis
shoes,
or
whatever,
is
without
knowing
it,
the
consequence
is
goodbye.
deportation.
unknown
speaker
there's
a
legal
consequence
in
this
sense
in
that
there
are
many
plea
bargains
and
plea
bargains
i'm
sure
have
been
influenced
by
the
fact
that
the
alien
who
pleads
guilty,
and
knows,
or
thought
he
could,
apply
for
discretionary
relief.
that's
a
legal
consequence
that's
been
changed.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it's
not
a
clear
case
either
way,
i
suppose.
wasn't
that
the
point
of
judge
easterbrook's
opinion.
i
forget
the
case.
it
was
cited,
i
guess,
in
the
government's
brief
in
which
he
suggested
what
has
been
suggested
here
that
your,
number
one,
the
consequence
does
not
depend,
need
not
depend,
on
anything
that
happened
since
the
guilty
plea.
and
the
guilty
plea
may
very
well
have
been
entered
on
the
ground
that
whatever
the
immigration
consequence
may
be,
it
was
a
consequence
that
it
was
at
least
subject
to
mitigation
by
the
exercise
of
discretion
and
the
alien
may
very
well
have
said,
my
best
shot
is
with
discretion
and
therefore
i'm
going
to
enter
the
plea
on
that
basis.
now,
since
there's
no
intervening
event
upon
which
the
immigration
is
going
to
be
predicated,
it
certainly
is
adding
a
consequence
that
was
not
there
when
the
immigrant
entered
the
guilty
plea.
unknown
speaker
even
apart
from
the
guilty
plea
cases,
it
does
attach
additional
legal
consequences
to
the
conviction
whether
by
guilty
plea
or
not.
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
courts
of
appeals
have
said
that,
is
it
not
correct
that
it
did
add
significant
legal
consequences
to
the
past
crime?
unknown
speaker
which
of
our
cases
are
you
relying
on
for
that
proposition?
unknown
speaker
landgraf,
which
uses
the
terms
additional
legal
consequences,
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
no,
it's
attaching
new
consequences
to
the
criminal
conduct.
that
much
seems
to
be
perfectly
clear.
unknown
speaker
but
the
second
circuit
said
it's
absurd
to
measure
it
in
terms
of
what
the
criminal
wrongdoer
expected
to
happen
in
that
sense.
but
nevertheless
it
does
attach
a
very
serious
additional
consequence.
but
you
just
said
in
landgraf
we
didn't
mean
to--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
guttentag,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
now
i
take
it
your
point
is
it
only
has
to
be
interpreted
once.
this
is
not
an
issue
once
it's
settled
that's
going
to
come
up
in
case
after
case
after
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
is
it
that
we
can
confine
the
decision?
you
think
this
would
be
a
very
rare
instance
in
which
there
would
be
an
application
for
review
under
your
theory
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
it
involves
a
class
of
eligibility,
then
there
might
be
people
who
say
they
in
fact
are
citizens
or
they
were
never
convicted
and
that
would
be
about
it?
unknown
speaker
can
you
narrow
that
further,
which
you
may
not
want
to
do?
but
this
particular
claim
i
was
thinking
of
is
like
a
claim
of
no
jurisdiction
because
it's
saying
there's
a
provision
of
the
statute,
a
whole
big
section,
that
just
doesn't
apply
because
the
time
hasn't
come
yet
for
it
to
apply.
unknown
speaker
and
now
is
that
like
jurisdiction
or
is
it...,
i
mean,
it's
not
literally
jurisdiction
in
a
12(b)(2)
sense
or
something
but
what
is--
unknown
speaker
--the
cases
that
heikkila
actually
cited
after
it
said
that
we
conclude
that
review
is
available
only
as
required
by
the
constitution,
and
there
are
three
or
four
of
them,
did
any
of
those
involve
a
situation
like
accardi.
unknown
speaker
and
there's
no
discussion
of
the
basis
of
review
in
accardi,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
the
majority
opinion,
do
they
say
exactly
what
the
basis
for
review
is?
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
that
if
they're
relying,
we're
relying
on
the
constitutional
line
that,
as
you
say
heikkila
set
forth
so
clearly,
they
would
have
cited
heikkila.
i
mean,
the
failure
to
cite
it,
it
seems
to
me,
is
so
significant
that
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that,...
regard
that
case
as
a
holding
that
this
is
a
constitutional
defect.
unknown
speaker
well,
accardi's
also
a
five
to
four
decision.
unknown
speaker
there
are
cases
of
this
court
denying
habeas
relief
in
such
circumstances,
aren't
there?
i
mean,
they're
old
cases
but
they're
cases.
unknown
speaker
but,
isn't
that
one
thing
congress
was
trying
to
correct
here?
they
thought
that
the
attorney
general
has
granted
far
too
much
discretionary
relief.
unknown
speaker
these
are
all
aggravated
felonies
under
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
colloquy,
the
colloquy
that
they're
talking
about
in
the
history?
unknown
speaker
mr.
guttentag,
what
do
you
say
about
mr.
kneedler's
reliance
on
section
309?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
what
you're
talking
about
is
something
in
lindh
where
there
is
a
different
situation
than
here.
do
you
think
that
congress
has
to
make
the
same
sort
of
showing
that
you
say
when
we're
basically
with
aliens
over
which
congress
has
plenary
power
and
who
do
not
have
vested
rights?
unknown
speaker
why.
what's
the
authority
for
that?
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
the
government's
distinction
that
we're
talking
about
treaty
rights
there?
unknown
speaker
suppose
congress
just
changes
its
immigration
laws
and
says
that
a
whole
large
category
of
people
who
previously
had
been
admissible
as
permanent
resident
aliens
are
no
longer
admissible.
they
have
to
pack
up
and
go
home.
can
congress
do
that?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
that's
fine.
but
if
congress
does
it,
is
that
retroactive?
it's
eliminating
a
qualification
that
used
to
be
valid
and
they're
saying
for
future
residents
in
the
united
states,
it's
no
longer
valid.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
closest
case
you
have
for
that
kind
of
thing,
that
kind
of
a
definition
of
retroactivity?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
would
draw
distinction,
using
justice
scalia's
example
to
a
new
statute
that
said
all
aliens
who
are
citizens
of
the
united
kingdom
shall
now
be
deported.
that
wouldn't
attach
any
legal
consequences
to
past
conduct.
that
they
could
do,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
they
were
naturalized
citizens
of
great
britain.
certainly
that
would
attach
it
to
past
conduct.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
consequence
involved
in
landgraf?
what
was
the
consequence
of
landgraf
of
applying
it
in
prior
conduct?
unknown
speaker
so,
you're
talking
about
the
imposition
of
criminal
penalties
or
penalties
for
a
past
act.
here
you
are
talking
about
who
can
stay
in
the
united
states.
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
totally
different
category,
i
think.
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
me
to
talk
about
making
the
statute
retroactive.
unknown
speaker
that's
exactly
what
i
think
it
would
suggest.
unknown
speaker
the
court
below
seemed
to
have
applied
its
rule
only
to
guilty
pleas
and
not
to
an
actual
conviction
on
trial,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
defend
that
distinction?
unknown
speaker
do
you
defend
the
distinction?
unknown
speaker
what
was
in
your
complaint.
what
was
the
category
in
your
complaint?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
thought...
that
your
case
was
in
fact
centered
on
the
guilty
plea.
unknown
speaker
so
that
whatever
would
apply
in
another
case
involving
a
trial
and
conviction
is
not
before
us
now.
unknown
speaker
i
must
confess
i
find
it
hard
to,
just
as
a
matter
of
interpreting
statutes,
to
say
it's
retroactive
to
some
people
convicted
of
a
crime
or
not
as
to
others.
just
as
a
matter
of
pure
logic,
i
think
it's
pretty
hard
to
swallow
for
me.
unknown
speaker
that
is
an
event
to
which
additional
legal
consequences
are
attached.
unknown
speaker
and
that
would
mean
there's
no
distinction
as
to,
you
know,
whether
he
got
caught
or
whether
he
was
sentenced
heavily
or
pleaded
guilty.
those
aren't
relevant,
really.
unknown
speaker
suppose
you
have
a
statute
that
eliminates
or
narrows
the
circumstances
in
which
a
governor
or
the
president,
for
that
matter,
can
grant
a
pardon.
that
statute
is
passed
and
is
framed
in
a
way
that
it
covers
all
crimes...
all
people
currently
in
prison.
would
you
say
that
under
our
retroactivity
law,
you
would
have
to
interpret
that
statute
to
apply
only
to
crimes
committed
after
its
passed
and
that
people
who
committed
crimes
before
that
in
reliance
upon
the
fact
that
if
i
stole
these
sneakers,
the
attorney
general
might
let
me
stay
in
the
country
anyway?
i
mean,
you
know,
this
is
not
a
very
substantial
reliance.
unknown
speaker
and
if
i
stole
the
sneakers,
the
attorney
general
just
might
let
me
stay
in
the
country.
this
is
the
kind
of
reliance
we're
protecting.
if
you
do
the
same
thing
in
the
pardon
context,
do
you
think
that
we
would
interpret
to
be
prospective
only
a
statute
that
narrowed
the
ability
of
a
governor
or
of
the
president
to
grant
mitigation
of
a
criminal
penalty?
unknown
speaker
wait,
it
was
discretionary
whether
they
had
to
grant
it,
but
they
had
granted
it
and
there
was
an
entitlement
to
it
as
it
was
described.
whereas,
here
you
have
nothing
but
this
off-the-wall
hope
that
the
attorney
general
might
let
you
stay
in
the
country.
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
interrupt.
we're
not
arguing
whether
it's
an
ex
post
facto
law
and
therefore
unconstitutional.
you're
only
point
is
that
they
have
to
be
clear
about
it.
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
to
his
question
should
be
depends
how
clear
the
statute
is.
unknown
speaker
i
told
you
what
the
statute
said.
all
it
said
is
that
this
eliminated...
this
discretion
is
eliminated
and
it
applies
to
all
crimes,
which
is
what
the
statute
here
says.
and
i
don't
think
there's
a
chance
in
the
world.
i'm
not
talking
about
ex
post
facto.
i
don't
think
there's
a
chance
in
the
world
that
we
would,
that
any
sensible
court
would
interpret
a
statute
like
that
to
apply
only
to
crimes
committed
in
the
future
because
all
the
people
who
committed
those
crimes
in
the
past
may
have
hoped
that
the
governor
would
grand
them
a
pardon.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
just
not
the
kind.
yes,
we
haven't
made
reliance
the
test
for
our
retroactivity
but
basically
what
retroactivity
law
seeks
to
protect
is
reliance.
and
i
find
the
reliance
that
we're
arguing
about
here...
such
an
insubstantial
thing.
unknown
speaker
i'm
suggesting
that
eliminating
an
act
of
grace
is
not
a
substantial
legal
consequence
of
the
sort
that
would
invoke
that
rule
neither
in
the
pardon
situation
nor
here.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
congress
thought
that
by
passing
this
very
harsh
law
they
would
discourage
people
from
committing
new
crimes,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
that's
one
of
the
purposes,
i
guess,
they
must
have
thought
it
would
have
had
an
effect
had
it
been
in
effect
earlier
on
the
old
crime
scene.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
guttentag.
mr.
kneedler,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
