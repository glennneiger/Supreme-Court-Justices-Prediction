mr.
lucas
guttentag
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
address
first
a
few
remaining
issues
on
the
jurisdictional
question
before
i
turn
to
retroactivity.
again,
an
analogy
to
the
exercise
of
the
pardon
power
is
simply
not
applicable
here
because
that
deals
with
the
exercise
of
discretion,
not
with
the
question
of
legal
eligibility.
we
raise
no
claim
regarding
the
exercise
of
discretion.
our
claim
is
regarding
the
attorney
general's
decision
to
exclude
from
eligibility
an
entire
class
of
individuals
based
on
the
attorney
general's
decision
to
apply
the
new
statute
retroactively.
that
question
of
whether
the
new
statute
applies
retroactively
is
a
pure
question
of
law
and
is
one
that's
governed
by
the
landgraf
principles
and
they're
for
courts
to
decide.
by
the
very
nature
of
the
inquiry,
it's
an
inquiry
that
must
be
decided
by
a
court
because
it
turns
to
what
congress
intended
pursuant
to
the
default
rules
that
this
court
enunciated.
secondly,
the
american
arab
case,
we
think,
doesn't
speak
to
the
question
here
because
the
american
arab
case
dealt
with
whether
claims
could
be
raised
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
whether
an
issue
had
to
await
resolution
until
there
was
a
final
order
of
deportation.
there
is
a
final
order.
this
is
not
about
the
fragmentation
of
procedures.
this
is
a
question
about
whether
any
court
at
any
time
will
be
able
to
review
this
claim.
and
as
we've
indicated
in
our
briefs,
we
believe
it's
appropriate
to
construe
the
statute
to
allow
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
this
pure
question
of
law.
that
does
not
lead
to
delay
of
proceedings
or
delay
of
removal;
it's
a
pure
question
of
law
that
needs
to
be
interpreted
as
to
what
the
statute
means.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
and
this
is
not
a
question
of
repetitive
review
of
exercises
of
discretion,
or
anything
like
that.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
yes,
i
think--
mr.
lucas
guttentag
--yes,
i
think
it's
an
extremely
narrow
group
of
cases,
your
honor,
and
that's
really
what
this
court's
decisions
during
the
finality
era
when
the
only
review
that
was
in
habeas
corpus
established
that
during
that
period
of
time
there
was
a
very
limited
class
of
claims
that
were
reviewable
and
they
went
to
either
constitutional
claims
or
claims
that
the
attorney
general
had
misconstrued
the
statute.
when
there's
an
error
of
law
going
to
the
construction
of
the
statute,
that's
reviewable.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
right.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
it
certainly
is
analogous
in
the
sense
that
the
attorney
general
has
decided
what
issue
he
has
jurisdiction
over
and
he's
decided
that
he
has
no
power
to
even
consider
these
claims
for
relief.
so,
in
that
sense,
it
certainly
goes
to
the
attorney
general's
determination
of
what
the
statute
means
and
what
class
of
cases
he
has
jurisdiction
to
consider
discretion
and
in
that
respect
it's
certainly
similar.
i
just
want
to
note
that
the
final
order
continues
to
be
contingent
on
the
adjudication
of
discretionary
relief.
it
has
been
like
that
since
1917.
it
continues
to
be
like
that.
the
new
cancellation
provision
is
still
the
same.
the
regulation
that
i
referred
to
earlier
is
at
212.3,
i
believe
it
is,
and
there
is
also
a
regulation
at
1229
under
the
regulations
implementing
1229(b)
of
the
statute.
one
goes
to
the
1182(c)
form
of
relief
that
we're
asserting
here.
the
other
one
goes
to
the
existing
cancellation
of
relief
that's
available
for
people
whose
convictions
occur
after
the
effective
date
but
it
continues
to
be
the
case
that
these
applications
for
relief
have
to
be
adjudicated
before
a
final
order
of
deportation
can
be
entered.
and
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
accardi
case
for
another
moment
because
it
is
the
case
that
accardi
was
decided
by
this
court
in
the
term
immediately
following
the
heikkila
decision
and
in
heikkila
the
court
went
back
and
reviewed
the
entire
sweep
of
decisions
that
this
court
had
decided
in
relation
to
review
of
deportation
orders
during
the
time
when
the
review
was
extremely
limited
and
was
limited
to
that
that
was
available
in
habeas
corpus
and
heikkila
reviewed
all
of
that
and
it
did
it
in
detail
and
at
the
conclusion
of
that
review,
it
said
that
the
only
scrutiny
that
was
available
was
that
which
was
required
by
the
constitution
and
the
very
next
year
this
court
looked
at
the
accardi
claim
and
in
that
context
held
that
the
claim
raised
there,
a
claim
regarding
discretionary
relief,
was
reviewable
and
the
dissent
went
back
and
cited
the
very
same
case
that
the
court
in
heikkila
had
said
restricted
review
to
the
minimum,
the
ecku
case,
and
said
that's
the
scope
of
review
that
we
think
is
appropriate
and
habeas
should
not
cover
that
claim
and
the
court
rejected
that
and
exercised
jurisdiction
over
the
claim.
so,
heikkila
and
accardi
together,
i
think,
establish
that
this
claim
is
reviewable
if
it
falls
within
that
and
it
clearly
does.
the
fact
that
congress
could--
mr.
lucas
guttentag
--those
cases
did
not
so
far
as
i
know,
your
honor.
the
accardi
case
came
the
following
term.
there
are
numerous--
mr.
lucas
guttentag
--but
there
is
in
terms
of
the
distinction
between
the
majority
and
the
dissent.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
it's
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
your
honor.
it
says
that
we
review
the
failure
to
exercise
discretion
and
it
distinguishes
that
between
the
exercise
of
discretion.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
well,
in
any
event,
at
a
minimum,
your
honor,
it
certainly
established
the
very
serious
constitutional
question--
mr.
lucas
guttentag
--yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
it
was
a
decision
of
this
court
and
specifically
rejecting
the
dissent's
view
of
the
scope
of
habeas
corpus.
it
was
a
five
to
four
decision.
but
in
any
event,
it
certainly
demonstrates
the
profound
constitutional
question
that
would
arise
if
this
statute
were
construed
to
bar
review
of
the
claims
that
have
historically
been
reviewed
and
there
is
a
long
series
of
courts
of
appeals
decisions
reviewing
precisely
the
same
kinds
of
legal
eligibility
claims.
we
cite
those
in
our
brief
in
footnote
10,
i
believe
it
is,
so
that
it
was
not
there
was
a
unique
circumstance
where
legal
eligibility
claims
in
relation
to
discretionary
relief
reached
the
courts.
it's
just
that
they
didn't
reach
this
court
until
the
accardi
case.
now,
i
do
want
to
recognize
congress
could--
mr.
lucas
guttentag
--not
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
where
the
court
said
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
kind
of
claim
that's
presented
here.
now,
it
is
true
that
congress
could
change
the
eligibility
criteria
and
congress
could
eliminate
discretionary
relief.
we
don't
dispute
that.
it's
our
contention
congress
hasn't
done
that
and
the
availability
of
discretionary
relief
has
to
be
based
on
what
the
statute
says.
and
the
statute
has
to
be
interpreted
in
light
of
this
court's
decisions
in
landgraf
and
other
decisions
as
to
whether
the
new
statute
eliminates
relief
retroactively
or
not.
but
that
question
is
a
legal
question
that
the
court
must
decide.
if
congress
were
to
change
the
statute,
that
would
be
a
different
situation
and
in
terms
of
the
general
principle
of
chenery
and
administrative
law,
the
attorney
general
has
not
said
i
would
adopt
a
general
rule
denying
eligibility
to
everyone.
he
hasn't
done
that
and
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
he
would.
historically,
fifty
percent
of
the
applicants
received
the
relief
if
they
were
eligible.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
that
may
be
so,
your
honor,
and
that's
what
congress
did
prospectively.
we
don't
believe
it
did
it
retroactively
and
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
attorney
general,
if
he
understood
that
he
had
the
authority,
would
apply
the
new
statute
retroactively
to
bar
relief
to
the
most
compelling
cases.
the
very
fact
of
applying
this
retroactively
means
that
the
kinds
of
individuals
who
are
the
most
qualified
for
the
relief
are
those
who
are
rendered
ineligible.
a
person,
and
this
is,
there
are
numerous
examples
set
forth
in
one
of
the
green
briefs
from
the
florida
immigrant
advocacy
center,
numerous
individuals
who
committed
offenses
20,
15,
10
years
ago,
minor
offenses...
theft
of
a
car
radio,
a
single
drug
offense
for
which
a
person
received
only
probation,
a
theft
offense.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
they
are
now
because
congress
explicitly
rendered
them
aggravated
felonies
by
specific
legislation
specifically
saying
that
this
applies
retroactively
to
old
convictions.
what
congress
did
not
do,
and
we
think
it's
a
very
different
inquiry,
it
did
not
say
that
the
eligibility
for
relief
that
that
is
eliminated
retroactively.
and
in
our
view
that's
a
significant
distinction
because
congress
may
and
clearly
did
want
to
sweep
a
wide
range
of
convictions
into
the
new
procedures.
but
it
did
not
say
that
it
wanted
to
eliminate
relief
particularly
for
those
individuals
whose
offenses
occurred
so
long
ago.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
well,
i
would
note
that
that
occurred
after
the
legislation
was
passed.
so,
to
the
extent
that
it
says
anything
about
it,
and
i
don't
know
that
it's
relevant
given
that
that
colloquy
occurred
after
the
statute
passed,
but
what's
important
is
to
look
at
what
the
statute
indicates.
and
we
believe
you
can
work
your
way
through
the
incredibly
detailed
and
nuanced
provisions
in
great
detail
and
never
find
anything
that
says
the
eligibility
for
relief
is
repealed
as
to
convictions
that
preceded
this
date.
there
is
nothing
there.
the
only
thing
that's
there
is
an
effective
date
that
says
that
the
new
statute
goes
into
effect
on
a
certain
date,
including
the
repeal
of
section
1182(c).
we
recognize
that
and
there's
a
provision
that
governs
transitional
rule
cases
and
that
says
that
those
cases
that
are
already
in
the
pipeline
shall
continue
to
be
governed
by
the
old
rules.
but
what
this
court
said
repeatedly
in
both
the
martin
v.
hadix
and
in
lindh
v.
murphy,
and
i'm
reading
from
page
22
of
our
brief
and
quoting
from
the
case,
the
only
thing
that's
sufficient
is
an
unambiguous
directive
or
expressed
command
that
the
statute
is
to
be
applied
retroactively.
language
is
so
clear
that
it
can
sustain
only
one
interpretation.
there
is
no
language
in
iirira
that
can
sustain
only
one
interpretation
to
apply
this
retroactively.
what
the
statute
does
is
say
that
new
cases
will
be
governed
by
new
rules.
we
understand
that
but
it
doesn't
say
that
the
eligibility
for--
mr.
lucas
guttentag
--309
says
only
that,
excuse
me,
that
cases
that
were
already
in
the
pipeline
shall
continue
to
be
governed
by
the
rules
in
place
at
that
time.
and
we
agree
with
that.
and
presumably
it
means
the
cases
initiated
after
that
time
will
be
governed
by
new
rules.
but
what
lindh
said
is
that
even
when
a
new
statute
goes
into
effect,
in
even
language,
it
says
a
new
statute
shall
apply
to
new
cases.
and
that's
at
best
an
inference
to
be
drawn
from
the
309
language,
because
it
doesn't
say
it
directly.
but
even
if
that
inference
could
be
drawn,
what
this
court
said
in
lindh
is
that
inference
is
not
in,
or
cautioned
that
that
inference
in
and
of
itself
is
not
sufficient
to
infer
a
retroactive
effect.
it's
not
sufficiently--
mr.
lucas
guttentag
--yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
i
think
the
chew
heong
case
most
significantly,
the
original
case
in
which
this
court
held
that
retroactive
analysis
does
apply
and
held
that
the
provision
did
not
apply
and
the
government
sought
to
distinguish
that
case
on
the
ground
that
it
involved
treaty
rights
and
so
on.
but
that
court
applied
retroactivity
analysis...
this
court,
excuse
me...
applied
retroactivity
analysis.
it
cited
the
same
cases,
u.s.
v.
heth,
and
others,
saying
that
retroactivity
analysis
applies
in
the
immigration
context.
it's
done
it
consistently
since--
mr.
lucas
guttentag
--i
don't
think,
i
think
that's
a
false
distinction,
your
honor.
what
we
have
here
is
legal
permanent
residents
who
are
asserting
rights
under
the
statute.
the
treaty
in
chew
heong
had
the
effect
of
a
statute
and
that's
what
the
court
said.
it
had
an
entirely
distinct
part
of
that
opinion
talked
about
retroactive
legislation
in
the
immigration
area.
here
we
have
legal
permanent
residents
who
are
asserting
a
statutory
right
and
based
on
the
fact
that
congress
didn't
legislate
with
sufficient
specificity.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
congress
can
do
it
if
it
does
it
explicitly,
your
honor,
but
it
can't--
mr.
lucas
guttentag
--do
it
inferentially.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
right.
it
depends
on
what
it's
based
on,
your
honor.
what
this
court
said
is
that
retroactivity
analysis
is
a
practical
look
at
the
legal
consequences
of
a
past
event.
if
congress
says
every
immigrant
who
did
something
in
the
past
shall
now
be
deported,
that's
a
retroactive
effect
because
we
look
at
practical
consequences
and
irrevocable--
mr.
lucas
guttentag
--well,
i
think
that's
exactly
what
the
court
said
in
lindh
v.
murphy
and
that's
what
it
said
in
martin
v.
hadix
and
i'd
be
happy
to,
but
when
it
imposes.
what
the
court
said
in
martin
v.
hadix
is
a
common
sense
functional
judgment
about
whether
a
new
provision
attaches
new
legal
consequences
to
events
completed
before
the
enactment.
and
as
i
believe
justice
stevens
said
whether
it
increases
a
party's
liability
for
past
conduct,
attaches
a
new
disability
or
sweeps
away
settled
expectations
and
that's
all
language
from
landgraf
and
from
martin
v.
hadix
and
that's
what
occurred
here.
individuals
pled
guilty
based
on
the
law
as
it
existed
at
that
time
and
now
as
a
result
of
that
are
ineligible
for--
mr.
lucas
guttentag
--i
suppose
they
could,
your
honor.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
it
may,
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
critical
inquiry
is
whether
it's
an
irrevocable
act
that
was
based
and
it
sweeps
away
settled
expectations
and
attaches
new
legal
consequences.
and
if
congress
chooses
to
do
that,
and
i
think
this
is
the
important
distinction,
if
congress
chooses
to
do
that,
it
has
enormous
power.
but
it
has
to
do
it
explicitly.
and
it
can't
do
it
by
inference.
and
that's
why
landgraf
laid
down
the
rule.
congress
is
obligated
to
look
at
the
consequences
of
what
retroactive
legislation--
mr.
lucas
guttentag
--to
the
employer?
i'm
sorry.
that
an
employer
would
have
been
subject
to
punitive
damages
based
on
a
discriminatory
act
that
occurred
before
the
law
change.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
well
that
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
if
the
employer
in
the
landgraf
case
were
an
immigrant,
that
imposing
punitive
damages
on
that
individual
for
their
discriminatory
conduct
would
be
retroactive
but
passing
a
law
now
that
says
an
immigrant
will
be
deported
based
on
that
past
discriminatory
act
is
not
retroactive.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
this
court
has
applied
the
same
principles
that
congress
must
legislate
explicitly
in
the
immigration
context,
not
the
chew
heong
case.
it
did
it
in
kessler
v.
strecker.
it
did
it
in
mahler
v.
eby.
again
and
again,
it's
precisely
because
the
consequences
are
so
severe
and
i
think
that
the
consequences
for
an
immigrant
to
be
deported
on
any
real
life
practical
consequence
are
far
greater
than
the
imposition
of
damages
on
an
employer
and
there's
a
protected,
as
well
as
this
court
having
recognized
again
and
again
that
a
permanent
resident
has
a
protected
liberty
interest
in
being
here.
it
doesn't
mean
that
congress
doesn't
have
the
power
but
it
must
do
it
explicitly.
and,
again,
as
i
say,
i
don't
think
that
there's
anything
in
this
statute,
the
various
provisions,
there
is
not
a
specific
provision
that
says
that
even
though
the
new
definition
of
aggravated
felony
sweeps
very
broadly,
we
acknowledge
that
and
we
recognize
that.
congress
has
cast
the
net
very
wide
but
it's
precisely
because
of
that
that
the
elimination
of
discretionary
relief
is
so
devastating
and
that
if
congress
intended
not
only
to
sweep
everyone
in,
but
then
also
to
eliminate
any
eligibility
for
discretionary
relief
that
existed
at
the
time.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
yes.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
well,
we
believe
the
guilty
plea
represents
the
most
compelling
example
of
where
the
greatest
reliance
occurs,
but
we
think
anything...
new
consequences--
mr.
lucas
guttentag
--no,
we
believe
that
the
distinction
should
apply
equally
to
a
conviction
but
the
court
need
not
decide
that
here
because
this
individual
pled
guilty.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
mr.
st.
cyr
pled
guilty
and
so
that
was
the
challenge
that
was
brought
in
his
case
so
far
as
i
recall.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
not
directly
presented
by
this
case
and
i
might
note
that
when
this
court
decided
the
hughes
aircraft
case,
it
didn't
pick
the
particular
retroactive
past
event.
there
was
the,
it
was
the
final
determination.
since
all
the
relevant
events
occurred
prior
to
the
change
in
law,
this
has
a
retroactive
effect
and
we
will
leave
for
another
day.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
it
would
ultimately
go
back
to
the
commission
of
the
offense
because
that's
the
point
at
which
the
irrevocable
act
occurs
and
new
consequence--
mr.
lucas
guttentag
--that's
right,
your
honor,
we--
mr.
lucas
guttentag
--that
would
be...
and
that's
consistent
with
what
the
court
does
of
course
in
the
ex
post
facto
context.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
but
reliance--
mr.
lucas
guttentag
--your
honor,
first
the
critical
inquiry
is
not
reliance
and
this
court
has
not
said
that
reliance
is
the
test
for
retroactivity.
it's
new
legal
consequences.
whether
that
would
apply
to
a
pardon
or
not,
i'm
not
sure,
but
it
is
the
case
that
this
court
has
said
that
in
the
context
of
game
time
credits
in
the,
i
believe
it
was
the
weaver
case,
although
i
may
be
wrong,
it
said
that
the
eligibility
for
relief
from
sentencing
that
is
discretionary...
there
was
an
act
of
grace
with
the
board
of
parole
that
has
a
retroactive
effect
and
hence
violates--
mr.
lucas
guttentag
--no,
i
disagree
with
that,
your
honor,
because
what's
here
is
the
legal
entitlement
to
apply.
that's--
mr.
lucas
guttentag
--that's
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
that's
right.
that
is
right
and
i--
mr.
lucas
guttentag
--the
obligation....
mr.
lucas
guttentag
but,
your
honor,
in
that
respect,
that's
where
the
ex
post
facto
cases
are
relevant
because
the
ex
post
facto
cases,
which
this
court
has
cited
in
the
civil
retroactivity
context
is
what
constitutes
a
retroactive
effect.
look
not
to
what
the
individual
relied
on
in
any
sort
of
sense
that
we're
talking
about
right
now
but
rather
whether
it
attaches
new
legal
consequences.
if
it
does
that
in
the
criminal
context,
it
violates
the
ex
post
facto.
if
it
does
in
the
civil
context,
congress
has
to
be
clear
to
achieve
that
effect
and
here
because
of
the
circumstances
in
which
this
applies
it
is
particularly
evident
what
the
new
legal
consequences
are.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
the
cases,
i
think,
support
the
view
that
the
fact
that
it
is
discretion,
in
fact
in
hughes
aircraft
itself--
mr.
lucas
guttentag
--it
certainly
is
one
of
the
purposes.
mr.
lucas
guttentag
right,
that's
certainly
one
of
the
elements.
and
it's
not
analogous
to
an
injunction
because
this
is
not
an
ongoing
prohibition
against
deportation.
and
that's,
this
is
a
one
time
negating
the
immigration
consequences
of
a
prior
criminal
conviction.
that's
what
the
waiver
does.
it
is
not
on
ongoing
injunction
against
deportation
and
that
also
distinguishes
this
circumstance
from
the
other
cases
that
the
government
was
speaking
about
that
were
discussed
in
aadc...
prosecutorial
discretion,
an
after
the
fact
decision
by
the
attorney
general
not
to
actually
implement
the
deportation
or
something
like
that.
those
are
discretionary
acts
and
we
recognize
that.
and
those
are
not
in
the
same
category
as
this
particular
form
of
relief
from
deportation
which
has
been
in
the
statute
since
1917
and
upon
which
the
final
order
of
deportation
is
contingent.
so,
deferred
action,
and
prosecutorial
discretion,
those
other
kinds
of
things
are
very
different
and
that
might
be
a
unilateral
hope
but
eligibility
for
a
waiver
of
deportation
is
not.
i
believe
that
the
question
this
court
faces
is
whether
a
pure
question
of
law
decided
by
the
attorney
general
that
will
determine
whether
deportation
becomes
mandatory
for
persons
who
committed
offenses
many,
many
years
ago
at
a
time
when
the
eligibility
for
relief
was
in
the
law
and
their
likelihood
of
receiving
it
was
at
least
fifty-fifty,
whether
that
pure
question
is
reviewable
in
any
court.
the
attorney
general
has
decided
that
he
lacks
all
authority,
not
because
he
doesn't
want
to
grant
relief,
not
because
he
thinks
it
might
not
be
appropriate
in
many,
many
cases
but
because
the
attorney
general
determined
that
he
lacks
the
statutory
authority
because
congress
took
it
away
from
it.
we
believe
that
legal
ruling
is
wrong
and
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
manifests
the
clear
and
unambiguous
intent
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
in
the
retroactivity
context
is
mandatory
to
impose
those
kinds
of
drastic
new
legal
consequences
on
long
time
legal
permanent
residents
who
have
made
their
lives,
who
have
established
their
families,
and
who
have
done
nothing
wrong
but
that
one
offense,
one
time
in
the
past
and
ever
since
complied
with
the
law
and
are
now
swept
up
in
this
change
and
subject
to
mandatory
deportation.
