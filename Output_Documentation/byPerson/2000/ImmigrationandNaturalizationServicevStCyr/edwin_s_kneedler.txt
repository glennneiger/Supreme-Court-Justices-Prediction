mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
this
case,
there
are
questions
both
of
jurisdiction
and
of
the
merits
of
whether
the
attorney
general
reasonably
construed
the
act
to
conclude
that
petitioner
in
this
case,
oh,
excuse
me,
respondent
in
this
case
is
ineligible
for
discretionary
relief
under
the
repeal
of
1182(c).
i
do
want
to
make
sure
that
i'm
able
to
address
the
merits
question,
but
i
did
have
a
few
things
that
i
wanted
to
address
with
respect
to
habeas
corpus
and
the
constitutional
question
here.
one
recent
decision
of
this
court
which
i
think
is
instructive
on
the
question
of
when,
what
sorts
of
claims
congress
must
make
a
judicial
forum
available
to,
is
the
court's
decision
two
terms
ago
in
american-arab
anti-discrimination
committee
v.
reno
in
which
the
court
concluded
that
a
constitutional
claim
of
selective
enforcement
was
not
a
judicially
cognizable
defense
to
a
final
order
of
removal,
and
in
our
view,
if
congress
could
provide
under
the
immigration
laws
that
that
sort
of
claim
does
not
give
right
to
a
personal
right
to
have
a
final
order
of
removal
set
aside,
then
it
follows
a
fortiori
that
congress
is
not
required
to
provide
a
judicial
forum
for
a
failure
by
the
attorney
general
to
grant
discretionary
relief
from
removal
that
is
purely
statutory
in
form
and
particularly
here
where
the
objection
is
a
non-constitutional
objection
to
the
failure
to
grant
discretionary
relief.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
it
is
an
application
for
discretionary....
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
the
claim
is
that
i
am
not
subject
to
deportation
or
removal
because
the
statute
doesn't
apply,
that
is
subject
to
judicial
review
under
this
statute
and
we
think
that
the
suspension
of
habeas
corpus
clause
probably
does
require
that
a
court
be
available
to
entertain
a
claim
that
the
person
who
is
subject
to
removal
is
not
an
alien
and
is
not
subject
to
removal
because
in
those
cases,
we
will
assume,
this
certainly
for
purposes
of
this
case,
the
executive
would
be
acting
beyond
any
authority
granted
to
the
attorney
general.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
oh
yes,
no,
yes,
no,
i'm
sorry.
i
was
going
to
the
constitutional
claims
that
the
statutory
judicial
review
procedures
are
inadequate
because
they
don't
cover
more
things.
no,
you
certainly--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
that's
absolutely
right.
we
think
that
the
statute
provides
for
judicial
review
of
the
two
fundamental
points
at
issue
in
a
removal
proceeding.
is
the
person
an
alien
and
is
the
person
subject
to
removal?
the
statute
provides
for
that.
the
zipper
clause
that
this
court
referred
to
in
the
aadc
v.
reno
provides
that
all
questions
of
law
and
fact,
including
statutory
interpretation
and
constitutional
interpretation
can
be
heard
only
on
judicial
review
of
a
final
order
of
removal
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
do
you
mean,
in
the
current
law
or
the
prior
law?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
current
law.
no,
it's
a
substitute
for,
an
expedited,
a
substitute
for
a
court
of
appeals
review.
people
in
that
category,
their
orders
of
removal
are
reviewed
only
in
the
district
courts,
not
in
the
courts
of
appeal.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in
the
prior
law,
it
was
frankly
unclear
to
what
extent
habeas
overlapped
with
court
of
appeals
review,
and
this
was
i
think
part
of
the
problem.
some
courts
have
held
that
in
habeas
the
alien
could
not
get
review
of
the
merits
of
the
deportation
order
but
could
just
challenge
the
detention.
some
courts
have
allowed
some
review
of
the
deportation
order,
which,
of
course,
would
have
provided
for
duplicative
review
in
the
courts
of
appeals
and
the
district
courts.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
i
think
the
reason
under
the
new
law
was
one
of
expedition,
to
not
have
two
stops
in
the
court
but
only
one
petition
for
review
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
wasn't?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
the
provision
in
the
ina
was
necessary
to
preserve
that
habeas
corpus
because
the
prior
act
was
worded,
the
judicial
review
is
in
the
courts
of
appeals
under
the
hobbs
act
except,
and
as
this
court
said
in
stone
there
were
a
series
of
exceptions
that
follow
that,
one
of
which
was
the
specific
exception
for
district
court
habeas.
now,
whether
one
views
that
exception
as
itself
a
grant
of
habeas
or
a
preservation
of
habeas
under
2241,
we
think
is
essentially
irrelevant.
in
either
event,
the
expressed
exception
to
seek,
to
preserve
that
was
necessary
and
to
our
knowledge
no
court
held--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--1105(a)(10).
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
some
courts
said
it
was
2241.
some
said
it
was
1105(a).
some
courts
didn't
explain
it
and
there
was
really
no
reason
to.
in
our
view,
probably
the
best
way
to
look
at
it
is
that
1105(a)
preserved
general
habeas
jurisdiction
but
you
could
look
at
1105(a)
as
a
specific
grant,
but
in
either
event,
it
was
an
expressexception
to
what
otherwise
would
have
been
an
exclusive
court
of
appeals
jurisdiction
which
the
legislative
history
we
set
out
in
our
brief
of
the
61
act
shows
that
congress
was
aware
that
habeas
corpus
would
have
been
precluded
if
the
statute
had
been
permitted
toward...
to
be
worded
that
way.
i
also
want
to
just
briefly
just
touch
on
the
notion
that
there
is
an
unconstitutional
suspension
of
habeas
corpus
if
the
act
operates
in
the
way
that
we
describe.
and
we
think
that
that
is
clearly
not
correct.
as
this
court
said
in
felker,
first
of
all,
habeas
corpus
is
available
only
insofar
as
it's
provided
by
law.
the
courts
are
not
free
at
large
to
address
that
question
and
the
court
also
reiterated
in
felker
that
congress,
that
it's
essentially
up
to
congress,
at
least
in
the
first
instance,
to
exercise
the
judgment
as
to
what
the
scope
of
the
writ
should
be.
beyond
that,
in
this
context
we
think
that's
especially
so
because
congress
has
plenary
power
over
immigration
and
has
to
be
able
to
balance
the
need
for
access
to
the
courts
against,
in
this
situation,
what
congress
saw
to
be
a
critical
need
for
expeditious
removal
of
criminal
aliens
who
have
already
had
a
chance
to
test
their
criminal
convictions.
and
finally,
this
court
has
also
said
that
congress,
deference
is
owed
to
congress
with
respect
to
what
due
process
procedures
are
appropriate
for
people
generally,
and
again,
that's
something
where
deference
we
think
is
especially
appropriate
in
the
immigration
context.
for
all
of
these
reasons,
we
think
congress's
judgment
as
to
what
sorts
of
things
should
be
subject
to
review
and
what
should
not
is
due
extraordinary
deference
by
this,
by
this
court.
and,
in
particular,
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
is
required
to
provide
for
judicial
review
of
a
power
that
it
has
granted
in
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general.
this
is
not
worded
as
a
personal
right
of
the
alien,
much
less
a
personal
right
that
is
so
fundamental
that
an
alien
should
have
access
to
courts,
must
have
access
to
courts,
to
litigate
it.
congress
should
not
be
put
to
the
choice
or
put
in
the
all
or
nothing
position
of
granting
discretionary
powers
to
the
attorney
general
only
at
the
cost
of
buying
into
a
system
of
judicial
review.
as
this
court
said
in
aadc
v.
reno,
there
are
a
number
of
discretionary
determinations
the
attorney
general
makes
all
the
time
with
respect
to
whether
to
institute
proceedings
in
the
first
place,
whether
to
drop
them
along
the
way,
whether
to
perhaps
not
execute
the
order
of
removal
at
the
end
of
the
day.
those
are
all
discretionary
and
surely
congress
is
not
required
to
provide
for
judicial
review
of
that.
congress
could
conclude
that
this
should
be
regarded
in
the
same
way.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
attorney
general
has
the
authority
not
to
execute
an
order
of
removal
if
there
was--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
there's
certainly
a
general
rule
that
final
orders
of
removal
will
be
carried
out
because
that's
what
congress
had
in
mind,
but
congress--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i,
i
can't
represent
that
every,
that
every
case
has
been
brought
but
one
of
the
things
to
bear
in
mind
is
that
when
congress
passed
iirira
and
expanded
the
definition
of
aggravated
felony,
it
made
that
definition
applicable
to
offenses
that
occurred
before
1996
and
in
ins's
view,
that
meant
that
congress
wanted
ins
to
do
something
about
people
who
had
previously
committed
offenses
and
may
not
have
been
aggravated
felons
before.
so,
the
general
thrust
of
the
ins's
enforcement
efforts
has
been
that
but
i
certainly
can't
represent
that
it
would
never
decline
to
remove
someone.
and
the
fact
that
in
accardi
again
an
unexplained
decision,
this
power
may
well
once
have
been
exercised
should
not
prevent
congress
from
revisiting
the
question,
revisiting
the
question
of
how
discretionary
relief
should
be
thought
of
in
saying
for
these
purposes,
it
is
constitutionally
equivalent
to
the
sort
of
discretion
to
institute
proceedings
in
the
first
place
that
was
unreviewable
in
aadc
v.
reno
even
for
constitutional
grounds
and
has
been
held
unreviewable
in
other
situations
as
well.
now,
to
the
merits
of
the
question.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it's,
the
fact
that
it's
not
judicially
reviewable
doesn't
make
it
lawless.
there
are,
there
are
either
formal
standards
as--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
don't,
i
don't,
i
don't
believe
there
are
and
this
court
pointed
out
in
aadc
v.
reno
that
there
were
internal
guidelines
for
the
exercise
of
that
discretion
in
the
past
and
the
ins--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
am
not
aware
of,
but
congress
could
reasonably
conclude
that
the
statutory
provisions
for
cancellation
of
removal
sets
up
a
similar,
or
allows
the
attorney
general
to
set
up
a
similar
regime
but
doesn't
in
the
process
require
judicial
review
of
that
in
the
courts.
if
i
could
turn
to
the
merits
question
of
whether
the
attorney
general
reasonably
determined
that
the
repeal
of
1182(c)
does
not
provide
a
basis
for
relief
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
congress
specifically
addressed
the
temporal
applicability
of
all
of
title
iii-a
of
iirira
of
which
this
repeal
is
a
part
in
section
309
of
the
act.
in
309(a)
congress
specified
what
it
called
a
title
iii-a
effective
date,
which
was
six
months
after
iirira
was
enacted,
the
delay
obviously
being
put
in
place
to
allow
the
attorney
general
to
set
up
the
new
procedures.
and
then
congress,
in
309(c)
specified
what
is
the
operative
event
for
applying
that
effective
date.
what
it
said
was
that
for
people
in
exclusion
or
deportation
proceedings,
note
not
removal
proceedings,
an
exclusion
or
a
deportation
proceedings
as
of
the
title
iii
effective
date,
the
amendments
made
by
title
iii
shall
not
apply
but
instead,
the
prior
law,
the
ina
as
in
effect
prior
to
title
iii-a
shall
apply.
it
follows
for
people
like
the
petitioner
here,
excuse
me,
the
respondent
here,
who
was
put
in
removal
proceedings
after
the
title
iii-a
effective
date
that
congress
intended
that
the
title
iii-a
provisions
would
be
applied
and
congress
enacted
them
as
a
package.
as
i
mentioned,
it
eliminated
deportation
and
exclusion
and
replaced
it
with
removal.
it
repealed
specifically
1182(c)
and
replaced
it
with
cancellation
of
removal
and
it
provided
a
new
system
of
judicial
review.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
with
respect
to
the
notice
point,
congress
specifically
made
the
definition
of
aggravated
felony
applicable
to
offenses
that
occurred
before
that
enactment
and
that
includes
situations
in
which
someone
might
be
rendered
removable.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
several
things.
first
of
all,
we
don't
think
it's
technical.
we
think
the
statutory
specification
of
an
effective
date
and
what
events
that
effective
date
attaches
to
couldn't
be
clearer
from
looking
at
section
309
of
the
act.
congress
identified
the
commencement
of
proceedings
as
the
operative
event
and
that
makes
sense
because
what
cancellation
of
removal
as
it's
now
called
is
something
that
is
a
forgiveness
of
a
ground
of
removal.
it's
something
that
only
arises
after
the
removal
proceedings
have
been
brought.
so,
we
think
the
statutory
answer
is
clear.
with
respect
to
fairness,
it
depends.
congress
is
looking
at
fairness
from
a
broader
perspective.
it
was
looking
at
fairness
from
the
perspective
of
a
large
number
of
criminal
aliens
in
this
country
who
had
not
obeyed
our
laws
and
it
wanted
to
do
something
about
it
and
congress
also,
and
importantly,
concluded,
made
the
judgment
that
the
executive
branch
was
granting
far
too
many
applications
for
discretionary
relief
under
1182(c).
what
congress
did
here
spoke
to
the
attorney
general.
it
did
not
speak
to
any
supposed
rights
of
individual
aliens.
it
was
responding
to
what
it
regarded
as
excessive,
and
even
referred
to
as
abuse
of
the
power
that
was
granted
by
the
attorney
general
and
they
wanted
to
take
that
away,
and
they
wanted
to
take
that
away
now.
the
only
effective
way
they
could
do
that
was
to
stop
now.
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
sense
to
grandfather
in
people
who
may
have
committed
crimes
10
or
20
years
ago
if
what
they
wanted
to
do
was
to
stop
the
executive
branch
from
granting
too
many
applications.
at
the
close
of
our
reply
brief,
we
had
citations
to
a
colloquy
between
senator
abraham
and
senator
hatch
and
if
you
read
that
colloquy,
it
responds
directly
to
your
point,
justice
breyer.
we
don't
set
it
out
at
length.
but,
importantly,
in
iirira
congress
actually
drew
back
a
little
bit
on
the
disqualification
for
discretionary
relief.
under
aedpa
the
disqualification
under
1182(c)
for
criminal
aliens
was
broader.
in
iirira
for
a
permanent
resident
alien,
congress
confined
it
to
aggravated
felony.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
what
senator
hatch
said
as
in
explaining
one
of
the
reasons
for
having
done
this
was
that
in
the
category
that
congress
allowed
to
get
relief
under
cancellation
of
removal,
which
was
a
category
that
was
barred
under
aedpa,
those
might
have
included
people
who
committed
their
crimes
a
long
time
ago
and
those
were
the
minor
crimes
that
congress
identified
as
saying
those
people
should
be
eligible
not
for
1182--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--pardon
me?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
he
was
referring
to
any
crime
that
might
have
been
a
long
time
ago.
well,
that's
the
important
thing.
but
even
then,
what
congress,
what
he
explained
is
that
congress
made
them
eligible
for
cancellation
of
removal.
he
didn't
say
that
congress
had
somehow
carried
forward
1182(c)
relief,
which,
as
we
point
out,
was
expressly
repealed
in
section
304(b)
of
iirira,
and
it
was
repealed
because
it
had
been
replaced
with
the
provision
for
the
cancellation
of
removal
which
congress
intended
to
be
applied
as
part
of
a
package
dealing
with
the
institution
of
removal
proceedings
and
then
the
cancellation
of
removal
proceedings.
congress
did
not
intend
a
hybrid
sort
of
thing
where
discretionary
relief
from
inadmissibility
could
somehow
be
applied
in
the
proceeding
where
that
didn't
even
make
sense.
but
beyond
the
statutory
answer
to
the
question
that
we
think
congress
supplied
in
section
309,
this
change
in
the
law
is
not
retroactive
within
the
meaning
of
this
court's
retroactivity
jurisprudence
and
there
are
a
variety
of
ways
in
which
that
could
be
understood
but
they
all
point
in
the
same
direction.
and
i
would
like
to
identify
them
because
they're
different
ways
of
coming
at
them.
first
of
all,
this
court
has
said
in
lopez-mendoza
and
most
recently
again
in
the
aadc
case
that
the
enforcement
of
the
immigration
laws
is
inherently
prospective.
it
looks
to
the
question
of
whether
aliens
will
be
permitted
to
remain
in
the
united
states
in
the
future,
whereas
the
court
said
in
aadc,
deportation
is
necessary
in
order
to
bring
to
an
end
an
ongoing
violation
of
the
law.
and
the
reason
why
this
is
so
is
that
part
of
the
justification
for
congress's
plenary
power
over
immigration
is
as
this
court
said
in
the
harisiades
case,
that
congress
has
to
take
into
account
the
contemporaneous
policies
with
respect
to
aliens.
it
has
to
decide
at
any
particular
moment
in
time
who
that
is
an
alien
in
this
country
should
be
permitted
to
remain
and
who
should
not.
removal
is
not
punishment
or
regulation
of
past
conduct.
it
is
a
determination
of
who
should
be
permitted
to
stay
in
the
united
states
in
the
future.
another
point
that
can
be
made
about
1182(c)
and
congress's
repeal
of
it
is
that
it
operates
much
like
the
repeal
of
the
authority
to
grant
injunctive
relief.
when
the
attorney
general
grants,
under
the
prior
law,
granted
1182(c)
relief,
it
was
essentially
an
injunction
against
carrying
out
an
order
of
deportation.
well,
this
court
has
made
clear
than
when
congress
most
recently
in
miller
v.
french
that
when
congress
changes
the
authority
for
granting
prospective
relief,
that
that
change
in
the
authority
for
granting
prospective
relief
has
to
be
applied
by
the
courts
at
the
time
that
it
is
applied,
that
it
arises.
another
point
is
that
this
statute
speaks
to
the
power
of
the
attorney
general
not
to
any
rights
of
the
alien.
this
provision
has
never
been
worded
as
a
right
of
the
alien.
it
is
again
an
act
of
grace
or
like
a
pardon
as
this
court
has
said.
and
this
court
has
made
clear
in
its
retroactivity
jurisprudence
and
in
kansas
v.
hendricks,
for
example,
even
in
considering
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
that
a
statute
is
not
retroactive
simply
because
it
arises
in
a
case
that
is
based
on
antecedent
conduct.
you
have
to
look
to
see
whether
it
is
punishment
or
a
penalty
for
the
past
conduct
or
whether
what's
going
on
is
simply
regulating
someone's
current
ability
and
in
kansas
v.
hendricks
it
was
a
current
ability
to
be
at
large.
the
statute,
though,
was
triggered
on
the
basis
of
prior
conviction.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
believe
it
would.
it
does
not
attach
new
legal
consequences
in
the
sense
relevant
to
retroactivity
analysis.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
for
example,
if
there
is
an
enhanced
penalty
provision
for
a
second
offense
based
on
having
committed
a
prior
offense,
that's
not
considered
to
be
retroactive
under
ex
post
facto.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
is,
well,
it's
not
a
legal
consequence
of
a
guilty
plea.
this
statute
does
not
regulate
past
criminal
conduct
and
it
much
less
regulates
guilty
pleas.
it
provides
deciding
whether
somebody
will
currently
remain
in
the
country
on
the
basis
of
their
past
conduct.
a
guilty
plea
is
not
primary
conduct
of
the
sort
that
sometimes
gives
rise
to
retroactivity
analysis
in
other
settings.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
has
not
added
the
consequence
to
a
guilty
plea.
it
may
have
undermined
the
alien's
expectation
but
this
court
made
clear
in
landgraf
that
a
law
that
affects
someone's
pre-existing
expectations
does
not
itself
give
rise
to
retroactivity
analysis.
there's
not
the
slightest
suggestion
in
this
act
that
congress
intended
the
application
of
the
various
provisions
to
turn
on
whether
someone
pleaded
guilty
to
the
offense
or
did
not.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--every
court
of
appeals
that
has
looked
at
that
question
has
concluded
that
this
statute
does
not
raise
retroactivity
concerns
on
that
basis
because
it
goes
to
the
prospective--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--not
in
the
sense
used
in
this
court's
retroactivity
analysis
because
again
this
is
a
situation
that
looks
to
current
status--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
rely
on
the
discussion
in
landgraf
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
direct.
this
is
not
regulating
criminal
conduct.
this
is
regulating
status
in
the
united
states.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
has
undermined
expectations
but
we
do
not
believe
it
is
attaching
new
legal
consequences
in
the
relevant
sense.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not
in
that
sense.
in
aadc
v.
reno,
again,
the
court
said
that
immigration
law
is
prospective
and
retroactivity
analysis
we
think
just
doesn't
apply
for
that
reason.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
with
respect
to
the
cases
that
i
would
rely
on
for
nonretroactivity,
justice
stevens,
i
would
mention
kansas
v.
hendricks
where
the
court
said
there
was
no
ex
post
facto
violation
because
the
act
wasn't
retroactive
even
though
it
operated.
one
of
the
triggers
was
a
prior
conviction,
but
it
looked
to
current
and
future
of
status.
also,
the
cox
case
mentioned
in
landgraf
itself
gives
a
description
of
some
such
cases.
with
respect
to
attaching
new
legal
consequences,
that
has
to
be
proximate
legal
consequences
in
the
sense
of
the
statute
like
title
vii
itself
imposing
penalties
on
prior
conduct.
the
immigration
laws
do
not
regulate
and
penalize
prior
conduct.
they
look
to
someone's
current
status
and
decide
whether
he
shall
remain
in
the
united
states.
there's
no
pre-existing
right
to
remain
in
the
united
states
so
a
new
ground
of
removal
does
not
interfere
with
any
pre-existing
rights.
in
particular,
there
was
no
right
to
expect
to
be
granted
relief
from
deportation.
so,
even
if
a
new
ground,
substantive
ground,
for
removal
would
be
retroactive,
and
this
court's
opinions
would
refute
that,
certainly
taking
away
a
discretionary
power
in
the
attorney
general
to
grant
relief
in
the
future
is
in
no
way
retroactive.
we
think
this
case
comes
down
to
a
question
of
deference
to
the
attorney
general
under
this
court's
decision
in
aguirre
and
aguirre
and
chevron
and
the
attorney
general
has
reasonably
construed
the
act
not
to
allow
discretionary
relief.
with
respect
to
jurisdiction,
congress
was
not
required
to
recognize
this
form
of
relief
as
the
sort
of
fundamental
personal
right
that
habeas
has
to
be
available
for.
