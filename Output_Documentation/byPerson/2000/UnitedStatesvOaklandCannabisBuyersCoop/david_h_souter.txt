h.

well,
maybe
it
will,
but
isn't
the
real
concern,
and
i
want
to
state
a
variant
on
justice
kennedy's
question,
isn't
the
real
concern
behind
this
that
with
the
passage
of
the
california
proposition
and
the
popularity
within
the
california
population
that
that
necessarily
entails,
it
will
be
very,
very
difficult
for
the
government
ever
to
get
a
criminal
conviction
in
a
jury
trial,
and
the
reason,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
reason
i
assumed
this
was
being
brought
was
to
avoid
hung
juries
in
criminal
cases.
if
the
trial
court
in
fact
were
to
conclude
that
that
is
the
reason
and
that's
why
the
injunctive
remedy
was
being
invoked,
would
that
be
a
good
reason
for
the
court
to
say
it
is
not
certainly
a
necessary
and
maybe
not
an
appropriate
use
of
equity
to
give
the
government
an
alternative
to
six
month
or
less
sentences
for
criminal
contempt
in
order,
in
effect,
to
make
a
criminal
statute
enforceable
which
in
the
normal
criminal
course
is
not.
would
that
be
an
abuse
of
discretion?
justice
david
h.
souter
no
matter
what
the
lengths
of
sentence
requested?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
juries...
there
can
be
a
criminal
contempt
proceeding
if
the
injunction
is
violated
under
the
statute,
correct?
something
was
said
a
minute
ago
about
its
being
just
a
civil
jury.
the
u.s.
attorney
could
bring
criminal
contempt
if
someone
violated
it
and
i
thought
your
answer
was
under
the
statute
even
if
it's
criminal
contempt
and
the
penalty
would
be...
the
penalty
requested
would
be
within
the
minor
offense
range,
they'd
still
get
a
jury
trial
and
that
was
the
answer
to
my
suggestion.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
did
it
deprive
them,
i
mean,
ms.
underwood's
answer
was
they
get
a
jury
trial
in
any
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean
for
a
criminal
contempt?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
criminal?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
what
was
the
penalty
that
was
being
requested,
was
the
penalty
a
fine
or
cumulative
incarceration?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
was
requested
when
you
went
to
trial,
did
the
government
say,
we
forego
any
incarceration
as
punishment
we're
going
to
ask
for
a
fine
as
punishment,
did
the
government
make
any
specification
of
that
sort?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
in
effect
saying
that
even
if
it's
purely
civil
contempt
if
they
are
found
to
violated
the
injunction
and
they
do
not
agree
to
abide
by
the
injunction
in
the
future
they
can
at
least
be
jailed
coercively.
is
that
the
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
--may
i
just
ask
you
a
question?
i
take
it
there
was
no
constitutional
litigation
below
that
you're
raising
the
constitutional
issue
here
on
the
constitutional
avoidance
rationale.
justice
david
h.
souter
was
it,
i
mean,
did
you
put
in
evidence
on
it
or
did
you
argue
it
or
was
it
just
one
of
those
things
that
you
never
got
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
also
raise
the
commerce
clause
on
constitutionality?
