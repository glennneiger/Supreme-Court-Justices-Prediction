chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
00-151,
the
united
states
v.
oakland
cannabis
buyers.
general
underwood.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
romero-barcelo
was
a
civil
injunction
in
connection
with
the
epa,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
underwood,
if
you
take
it
as
a
criminal
prosecution
and
it's
an
unsettled
question
of
law
whether
it
is
a
medical-necessity
defense,
a
typical
district
trial
judge
is
probably
going
to
err
on
the
side
of
letting
it
in
since
you
can't
say
one
way
or
the
other
and
you
may
not
get
it
resolved
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well
general
underwood.
mr.
uelmen,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
a
civil
contempt
they
say
you
have
the
key
to
the
jail
in
your
own
pocket
because
it's
enforced
to
cause
to
you
do
something,
you
can
be
jailed
i
believe
on
civil
contempt.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
they
ask
for
a
jury
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
case
authority
for
that
sort
of
a
proposition
because
the
cases
you
cite
in
your
brief
strike
me
as
quite
far
off
the
point,
hecht
and
company
and
romero-barcelo.
in
those
cases
the
person
was
either
in
compliance
by
the
time
it
got
to
court
or
else
the
court
said,
look,
i
won't
issue
an
injunction,
romero-barcelo,
but
you
have
to
go
get
a
permit.
in
no
case
did
the
court
ever
say
well
we
think
you've
got
a
defense
to
this
act
so
we're
not
going
to
issue
the
injunction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
in
one
way
it
said,
the
violations
had
been
cured
as
promptly
as
they'd
been
called
the
attention
that
hecht's
had
put
in
a
new
staff
to
try
to
do
things.
i
mean,
it's
quite
different
from
your
case
where
you
say
we're
going
to
just
go
ahead
and
do
this.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
say
it
wasn't
contemplated
by
congress
when
congress
made
a
finding
that
there's
no
known
medical
use
for
it
doesn't
make
much
sense,
i
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
definition
of
schedule
one
in
the
controlled
substances
act.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
presumably
if
it
did
it
itself,
it
must
have
thought
that
it
qualified
for
schedule
one
under
those
criteria,
it
just
didn't
want
to
leave
it
up
to
an
administrative
agency
to
make
the
decision.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
other
case
in
which
this
court
has
recognized
the
medical-necessity
defense.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
asked
you
a
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
based
on
common
law,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you
have
here
is
a
statute
that
congress
enacted
that
quite
arguably
simply
ruled
out
the
sort
of
defense
that
you're
urging.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
from
its
placement
on
schedule
one.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
serious
does
your
medical
condition
have
to
be?
i
mean,
i
gather
cannabis
is
not
a
life-saving
drug.
it
alleviates
great
pain
and
discomfort.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
how
serious...
how
serious
does
a
case
have
to
be
before
this
medical-necessity
defense
kicks
in,
in
your
view.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
sort
of
harm?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
press
both
of
those
in
the
court
of
appeals
when
you
were
appealing
from
the
original
injunction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
pass
on
them
i
gather.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
it
was
pointed
out
earlier
that
the
district
court
here
whose
discretion
it
is
originally
granted
the
injunction
just
what
the
government
asked
for,
and
it
was
the
court
of
appeals
who
does
not
have
discretion
which
directed
the
district
court
to
exercise
it
in
a
different
way.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
should
we
do
if
we
decide
that
the
court
of
appeals
misconceived
the
law?
i
mean,
what
should
we
do
with
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
choice
of
evils
is
the
provider
faced
with?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
not
being
able
to
supply
the
person.
i
mean
it
certainly
isn't
the
provider's
responsibility
to
look
after
the
individual.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
letting
someone
die.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
don't
think
your
example
from
the
model
penal
code
would
envision
a
pharmacist
filling
a
prescription
or
filling
an
order
for
some
drug
that
is
on
schedule
one
which
no
prescription
is
good
for.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
a
state
law
requiring
a
prescription
for
a
bunch
of
drugs
can
be
violated
in
an
emergency.
it's
another
thing
to
say
that
a
schedule
one
law
which
says
there's
no
useful
medical
purpose
for
this
drug
shall
be
violated.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you
general
underwood.
the
case
is
submitted.
