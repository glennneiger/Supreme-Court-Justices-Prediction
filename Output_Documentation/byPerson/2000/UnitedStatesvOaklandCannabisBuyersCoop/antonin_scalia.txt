justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
underwood,
these
judgments
made
by
the
federal
agencies,
the
fda
and
the
dea,
i
think
they
take
into
account
the
overall
public
interest,
i
mean,
they...
i'm
not
sure
that
they
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
marijuana
would
never
ever,
ever
be
helpful
to
someone
who's
in
extreme
pain.
i
think
what
they've
probably
done
is
made
the
judgment
that
the
chances
of
its
being
that
helpful
and
not
being
replaceable
by
something
else
are
so
slim
that
in
view
of
the
abuses
to
which
general
permission
for
its
use
would
lead
it's
best
that
it
be
proscribed,
is
that
an
inaccurate
determination
on
my
part?
could
you
really
say
that
there
has
been
a
determination
by
the
federal
government
that
marijuana
is
never
medically
useful.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
not
be
an
abuse
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
scared
me
there
for
a
minute.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
underwood,
do
you
agree
with
all
of
the
premises
of
these
questions?
i
mean
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
it
true
that
california
juries
generally
don't
convict
people
of
crimes
that
they
don't
agree
with?
is
that
the
practice
in...
i
haven't
lived
in
california
in
quite
a
while
but
california
juries
only
enforce
those
criminal
laws
they
like,
is
that
the
general
practice.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
know
whether
this
united
states
attorney
brought
this
as
a
civil...
as
a
civil
matter
precisely
because
of
the
legal
doubt
or
rather
in
order
to
avoid
a
jury
trial,
do
we
have
any
idea
which
of
the
two
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
of
course,
this
entire
argument
would
disappear
if
congress
eliminated
the
criminal
penalty
and
then
presumably
the
u.s.
attorney
would
be
free
to
get
as
many
injunctions
as
he
liked
with
the
same
consequences.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
referring
to
the
legislative
history
i
presume,
it
doesn't
say
that
in
the
statute,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
some
little
piece
of
congress
said
that,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
out
of
evil
cometh
good,
general
underwood,
isn't
that
wonderful.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
just
said
out
of
evil
cometh
good
is
your
position
on
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
underwood,
what
is
the
penalty
for
violating
an
injunction?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
be
criminal
contempt?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
i'm
getting
to
is
would
you
be
entitled
to
a
jury
in
the
trial
for
contempt?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
make
a
big
difference
to
a
jury
who
doesn't
want
to
convict
this
person.
i
mean,
at
the
end
of
the
road
there's
a
jury,
which
is
going
to
let
you
off
if
it
wants
to
let
you
off,
whatever
the
standard
of
proof
is
so
that
if
the
u.s.
attorney
here
were
only
trying
to
avoid
a
jury,
he
ought
to
be
replaced.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
your
respondents
ask
to
be
prosecuted
criminally,
was
that
their
preference?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
i
thought
that
this
kind
of
civil
contempt
where
you
have
the
key
in
your
pocket
is
only
for
the
kind
of
contempt
that's
in
the
presence
of
the
court
where
you
refuse
to
testify
or
disrupt
proceedings
or
something
like
that,
i'm
not
sure
that...
any
way,
we
can
look
that
up.
let
me
come
to
your
perception
that
it
would
be
unthinkable
that
it
could
be
up
to
the
u.s.
attorney
whether
to
bring
a
criminal
action
or
not,
but
a
federal
judge
could
not
decide
that
he
won't
issue
an
injunction
using
the
same
sort
of
discretion,
why
is
that
so
unthinkable?
i
mean,
in
a
criminal
case
the
federal
judge
certainly
can't
say,
you
know,
i
don't
think
this
criminal
case
should
have
been
brought
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
stupid
prosecution
and
i'm
going
to
ignore
it.
he
can't
do
that,
can
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
say
this
civil
action
should
not
have
been
brought,
i
disagree
with
the
united
states
attorney
that
this
civil
action
which
is
authorized...
which
he's
authorized
to
bring
under
the
statute
should
have
been
brought
and
therefore
i
will
nullify
it,
you
think
a
court
has
that
power.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
the
case
how
could
it
be
that
the
patient
wouldn't
be
able
to
get
a
prescription.
i
mean,
you're
saying
it's
absolutely
necessary
for
you
to
stop
the
patient
from
dying
or
from
vomiting
or
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
not
a
doctor
in
california
who
will
say,
you
know,
here
i'll
write
you
a
prescription.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
so
it's
not
just
a
requirement
of
a
prescription
that
congress
is
prescribing.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
would
it
be
limited
to
cannabis
or
would
you
have
a
similar
exception
to
any
of
the
prohibitions.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be
up
to
the
individual
who
wants
it
to
take
his
chances
and
say
i
think
there's
medical
necessity
and
then
try
and
prove
that
later--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
you
know
if
he
really
thinks
he's
going
to
die
that's
an
easy
gamble
right,
a
jury
versus
the
grim
reaper,
i'll
take
the
jury
any
day.
justice
antonin
scalia
stomachache?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
harm,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
add
some
adjective
to
just
imminent
harm,
you
want
imminent
life-threatening
harm,
imminent
what?
you
want
to
exclude
a
stomachache
and
an
earache
maybe.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
uelmen,
let
me
talk
about
the
medical,
i
had
understood
medical-necessity
defense,
if
it
existed,
to
be
a
defense
on
the
part
of
the
person
who
is
in
medical
necessity
and
who
uses
marijuana
or
any
other
prohibited
drug
when
he
shouldn't.
now
you
would
extend
this
also
to
the
person
who
provides
it
to
any
persons
who
was
in
such
needs.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
would
extend
it
beyond
that
to
someone
who
opens
up
a
business
in
order
to
provide
prohibited
drugs
to
people
who
need
them.
that's
a
vast
expansion
beyond
any
necessity
defense
that
i've
ever
heard
of
before.
justice
antonin
scalia
i've
heard
of
necessity
defense
on
the
part
of
defendant
who
used
it
or
whatnot,
but
you're
saying
by
reason
of
a
necessity
defense
you
can
open
up
a
business
to
provide
for
these
necessities.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
is
this
is
a
regular
druggist,
this
is
not
a
druggist
who's
in
the
business
of
providing
illegal
drugs
to
people
in
necessity.
i
mean
you're
making
a
business
out
of
it.
i
can
understand--
