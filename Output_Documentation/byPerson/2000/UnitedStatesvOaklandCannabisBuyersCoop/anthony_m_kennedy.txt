justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
general
underwood,
there's
some
indication
in
the
trial
court's
observation,
he
had
no
choice
but
to
enter
this
injunction,
that's
something
of
an
over-reading,
but
suppose
i
were
the
district
judge
and
i
said,
you
know,
general
underwood,
you
want
me
to
basically
supervise
what's
going
to
be
a
major
effort
to
prosecute
people
and
you're
doing
this
under
my
contempt
power,
i
don't
want
the
court
to
get
involved
in
this,
you
have
your
own
united
states
and
assistant
united
states
attorneys,
you
have
investigate
these,
bring
these
as
prosecutions
and
then
we'll
hear
these
cases
and
if
there's
a
necessity
defense
or
something
we
can
rule
on
it,
but
you're
basically
asking
me
to
issue
an
injunction
and
in
order
to
enforce
it
i'm
going
to
have
to
make
prosecutorial
decisions,
i
don't
want
to
be
bothered
with
that
because
i
think
it
intrudes
upon
a
separation
of
powers
balance,
it's
making
me
more
of
a
prosecutor
than
a
neutral
judge.
if
he
said
that
would
he
be
abusing
his
discretion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
judge
has
legitimate
concerns
that
given
the
resources
of
the
court
that
it's
going
to
make
him
basically
substitute
for
the
united
states
attorney
in
the
northern
district
of
california,
he's
going
to
have
to
decide
who
to
prosecute
for
contempt
and
it's
going
to
be
criminal
contempt
and
so
forth,
basically
it
seems
to
me
that
he's
now
being
put
in
the
role
of
the
supervising
prosecutor
just
in
order
to
enforce
his
injunction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
sure
that
he
has
or
should
have
a
major
say
in
how
he's
going
to
enforce
his
injunction,
who
he's
going
to
bring
to
court
for
the
contempt
action
in
the
first
instance,
what
kind
of
examples
he's
going
to
make,
et
cetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
advantage
the
government
has
from
an
injunction
rather
than
a
concerted
effort
of
discrete
prosecutions
by
the
united
states
attorney's
office?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
you
do
want
us
to
rule
on
the
issue
that
the
ninth
circuit...
you're
ruling
just
as
a
general
matter
that
there's
no
medical-necessity
defense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
concerned
about
using
the
courts
to
answer
questions
so
remote
from
specific
disputes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
you're
very
pleased
with
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
in
one
sense
because
now
you
can
get
the
issue
resolved
up
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
just
don't
think
that's
a
good
use
of
the
federal
district
court's
authority.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
the
sanction
for
finding
of
a
civil
contempt
violation?
it
can't
be
jail.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
just
like
a
civil
nuisance
action,
it's
just
a
nuisance
action
in
the
federal
court
is
all
it
amounts
to.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just...
i
take
it
that
if
i'm
a
trial
judge
and
i
have
someone
who's
violated
my
injunction,
i
can't
say,
i'm
going
to
put
you
in
jail
now
until
you
sign
an
agreement
not
to
do
this
anymore.
i
can't
do
that.
it's
a
coercive
action
for
something
that's
within
the
power...
within
your
power
to
perform,
to
turnover
some
goods,
to
unlock
a
locker
to...
but
that's
not...
so
there
can't
be
any...
there
can't
be
incarceration--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
these
are
all
past
acts,
there's
nothing
to
incarcerate
for
or
am
i
wrong?
am
i
missing
something,
did
the
judge
incarcerated
these
people?
he
couldn't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
disagree
with
that
but
we'll
leave
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
doesn't
sound
to
me
limited
at
all,
even
with
drugs
that
can
be
dispensed,
doctors
are
required,
prescriptions
are
required,
that
wasn't
any
part
of
this
injunction
as
envisioned
by
the
ninth
circuit
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
nonmedical
people
deciding
the
so-called
medical
necessity.
that's
a
huge
rewriting
of
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
asking
us
to
uphold
that
this
defense
exists
in
broad
general
terms,
it's
a
sweeping
proposition
with
no
specific
plaintiff
in
front
of
us,
with
no
specific
symptoms
or
testimony
from
a
doctor
as
to
this
person,
which--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--which
led
me
to
question
that
the
whole
use
of
the
injunctive
power
to
begin
with
but
so
long
as
we
have
the
injunction,
the
statutory
authority,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
wait
for
a
specific
case
to
raise
this
defense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
in
the
meantime
it
seems
to
me
that
nuisance
can
be
enjoined
and
if
the
defendant
wants
to
take
his
chances
on
a
criminal
contempt
he
can
do
so.
