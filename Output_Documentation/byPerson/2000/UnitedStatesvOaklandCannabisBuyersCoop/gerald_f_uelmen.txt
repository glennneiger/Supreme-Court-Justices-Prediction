mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
the
government
initiated
these
proceedings,
it
made
a
tactical
choice
to
forego
criminal
prosecution
in
favor
of
seeking
injunctive
relief
pursuant
to
section
882.
that
choice
had
serious
consequences
for
the
respondents
because
it
deprived
them
of
the
full
opportunity
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
we
had
no
choice
in
the
matter,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
it's
a
jury
trial
in
accordance
with
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
which
means
that
the
court
can
enter
a
summary
judgment
and
the
court
does
not
apply
the
standard
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
that
actually
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
for
a
civil
contempt.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
well,
they
have
not
initiated
a
criminal
contempt
prosecution.
that
would
be
a
criminal
prosecution
and
we
would
have
a
right,
full
right
to--
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
--no.
i
believe
they
could
be
fined.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
if
you
refuse
to--
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
--yes,
until
you
conform
with
the
order.
and
that
happened
here.
i
mean,
these
respondents
were
found
in
contempt
of
court
without
a
jury
trial.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
yes,
but
the
court
ruled
that
under
section
882
the
trial
as
conducted
in
accordance
with
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
therefore
a
summary
judgment
could
be
entered
and
the
government
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
summary
judgment.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
no
fine
was
imposed.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
no,
the
government
asked
that
the
sheriff
or
the
marshal
seize
the
premises
in
which
the
business
was
being
operated
and
of
course
the
respondents
were
at
risk
of
incarceration
if
they
remained
in
contempt.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
but
the
point
is
the
defenses
that
the
respondents
wished
to
assert
were
never
determined
by
a
jury.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
absolutely.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
yes.
it
would
truly
be
ironic
to
hold
that
federal
prosecutors
have
full
discretion
to
decline
prosecution
but
when
they
elect
to
come
into
a
federal
court
sitting
as
a
court
of
equity,
that
court
has
no
discretion
to
decline
to
issue
an
injunction.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
clearly,
you
could
incarcerate
me
until
i
obey
the
court
order.
i
mean,
that's
done
all
the
time
with
a
witness
who
refuses
to
testify
and
is
held
in
contempt.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
he
did
not
in
this
case
because
the
respondents
agreed
to
refrain
from
the
conduct,
the
contempt
was
purged
ultimately,
but
if
the...
if
the
respondents
insisted
on
continuing
their
operation
in
violation
of
the
injunction,
they
could
have
been
jailed.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
in
a
criminal
case,
your
honor--
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
--in
a
criminal
case
a
judge
is
sitting
as
a
court
of
law,
what
we're
saying
is
when
a
federal
court
is
sitting
as
a
court
of
equity
it
has
the
traditional
discretion
to
weigh
the
interests,
to
balance
the
interests--
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
--what
we're
saying
is
that
all
the
statute
says
is
if
the
court
has
jurisdiction
to
issue
an
injunction
surely
they
can
come
in
and
ask
for
an
injunction
and
we're
saying
the
court
has
discretion
to
say
under
these
circumstances
i'm
not
going
to
issue
an
injunction.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
well
we
believe
that
hecht
v.
bowles
and
weinberger
v.
romero-barcelo
are
quite
on
point
because
in
both
cases
it
was
within
contemplation
that
future
violations
would
occur
and
the
court
still
declined
to
exercise
its
jurisdiction--
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
--well
in
romero-barcelo
the
court,
in
effect,
said
that
the
navy
can
continue
to
drop
its
bombs
while
it
applies
for
a
permit,
so--
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
--well,
first
of
all,
by
declining
to
enjoin,
the
court
is
not
allowing
the
violations
to
continue
because
the
government
still
has
the
option
of
initiating
a
criminal
prosecution
at
any
time
and
that's--
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
--that's
correct.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
what
the
ninth
circuit
held
is
that
the
district
court
had
discretion
to
allow
this
exemption
to
the
injunction
for
two
reasons,
first,
because
the
respondents
who
came
within
this
common
law
necessity
defense
were
not
violating
the
act
so
they
should
not
be
enjoined
because--
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
--well,
it's
not
a
blanket
defense,
your
honor,
in
is
the
sense
that
every
respondent
who
wishes
to
take
advantage
of
it
is
going
to
have
to
show
that
they
are
suffering
from
a
serious
medical
condition,
that
they
face
imminent
harm
of
death
or
blindness,
that
cannabis
will
alleviate
their
condition
and
that
they
have
no
reasonable
alternative,
that
everybody
alternative
available
has
been
tried
and
found
ineffective
for
them
so--
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
--well,
no,
actually
selling
to
anyone
other
than
the
limited
number
of
patients
who
come
within
this
exception
is
enjoined
by
the
preliminary
injunction,
all
the
court
has
done
is
to
create
a
very
narrow
exception
for
a
very
limited
number
of
patients
who
come
within
these
four
criteria.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
well
our
contention
is
that--
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
--well,
it's
implicit
in
all
of
these
conditions
that
there
is
a
medical
decision
being
made.
that
is,
no
patient
qualifies
under
the
california
initiative
unless
they
have
a
physician's
recommendation
or
approval
in
meeting
the
criteria
that
all
alternatives
have
been
tried
and
failed
implicitly
assumes
some
medical
supervision
in
that
process.
our
contention
is
that
when
we
come
within
this
medical-necessity
defense
no
prescription
is
necessary.
that
we're
dealing
with
highly
unusual
circumstances
that
were
not
contemplated
by
congress
when
it
required
a
prescription
for
the
normal
use
of
any
drug,
when
a
physician
issues
a--
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
--well,
your
honor,
congress
never
made
such
a
finding.
they
did
not
say
there
is
no
known
medical
use
for
cannabis.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
the
criteria
for
placement
on
schedule
one
or
movement
off
of
schedule
one
when
it's
done
administratively
by
the
dea
are
set
forth
in
section
812
and
those
criteria
do
include
no
currently
accepted
medical
use,
but
congress
itself
put
cannabis
on
schedule
one,
so
it
wasn't
bound
by
those
criteria.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
all
it
had
to
conclude
in
terms
of
a
rational
basis
test
was
that
it
wanted
to
impose
the
most
restrictive
limitation
and
that
is
schedule
one,
no
use
without
a
prescription,
but
we're
saying
even
that
finding,
that
there's
no
use
without
a
prescription,
is
not
a
rejection
that
under
limited
circumstances
where
a
patient
is
facing
imminent
harm
and
has
no
reasonable
alternative,
the
drug
cannot
be
used
without
a
prescription,
it's
a
classic
illustration
of
the
choice-of-evils
defense.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
that's
right.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
not
for
cannabis,
not
for
cannabis
because
it
is
on
schedule
one,
a
physician
cannot
write
a
prescription.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
well,
by
putting
it
on
schedule
one
they're
saying
you
can't...
you
can't
use
it
by
prescription,
now
when
a
doctor
issues
a
prescription
all
he's
concluding
is
that
this
will
help
you,
he's
not
required
to
conclude
that
you
have
no
other
alternative.
he's
not
required
to
conclude
you
have
a
serious
condition
and
you
may
die
or
go
blind
if
you
don't
have
this
medicine,
all
he's
got
to
say
is,
this
will
help
you,
here's
a
prescription,
go
get
it
and
take
it.
but
the
medical-necessity
defense
requires
much
more.
it
requires
a
conclusion
that
the
patient
is
facing
a
serious
medical
crisis.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
well,
calling
it
medical
necessity--
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
--no.
okay.
but
medical
necessity
is
just
an
example
of
the
classic
necessity
defense
defined
by
the
model
penal
code.
in
fact,
one
of
the
examples--
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
--yes,
it
is.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
well,
congress
certainly
didn't
explicitly
rule
it
out.
what
the
government
is
arguing
is
that
we
can
imply
this
limitation
from
the
structure
of
the
act
and
from
its
purpose,
but
a
careful--
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
--well,
its
placement
on
schedule
one
involves
this
issue
of
currently
accepted
medical
use
which
is
a
term
of
art
that
does
not
address
the
question
of
whether
under
particular
circumstances
of
an
individual
patient
facing
a
medical
crisis
there
might
be
medical
utility
for
the
drug.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
that
is
absolutely
correct.
this
defense
should
be
available
to
any
patient
in
any
state
regardless
of
whether
that
state
has
approved
under
broader
conditions
the
general
use
of
cannabis
as
medication.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
well,
if
the
conditions
are
met
that
you
face
this
imminent
crisis
and
no
other
alternative
is
available,
yes,
it
should
be
available
for
other
medications
as
well.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
that's
a
risky
venture
because
that
individual
is
going
to
have
to
prove
in
a
court
of
law
that
in
fact
he
had...
he
was
facing
this
crisis
and
he
had
no
alternative.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
well,
at
least
in
the
confines
of
the
modification
of
this
injunction
we're
talking
about
more
than
that,
we're
talking
about
a
requirement
that
you
prove
that
you
have
tried
all
of
the
other
alternatives
that
might
be
available
and
they
didn't
help.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
well,
we
believe
it
is
a
life-saving
drug.
it's
a
life-saving
drug
for
aids
patients
who
are
not
going
to
benefit
from
the
new
medications
available
to
keep
them
alive
if
they
can't
keep
their
weight
up,
if
they
can't
maintain
their
general
health.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
well,
in
the
injunction
we're
talking
in
terms
of
imminent
harm,
we
believe
that--
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
--death,
starvation,
blindness.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
no.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
we're
talking
about
patients
who
are
going
to
lose
their
sight,
who
are
going
to
forego
chemotherapy
or
radiation
because
they
can't
live
with
the
severe
nausea.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
no,
i
think
we're
talking
about
much
more
serious
harm,
but
we're
talking
about
balancing
the
choice
of
evils
here.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
clearly
congress
did
not
say
that,
but
if
it
did,
we
would
contend
that
we
then
have
a
serious
constitutional
problem
in
terms
of
a
violation
of
the
substantive
due
process
right
to
preserve
your
life,
then
we
can
cite
the
glucksberg
case--
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
--yes,
the
constitutional
issue
was
raised
but
in
a
different
context.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
it
was
argued
in
the
context
of
the
broader
motion
to
dismiss,
but
with
respect
to
the
medical-necessity
issue
that's
before
this
court,
our
position
is
that
if
this
statute
is
construed
to
preclude
a
medical-necessity
defense
under
these
circumstances
where
the
patient
faces
loss
of
life
or
loss
of
sight
there
would
be
a
violation
of
a
substantive
due
process
right--
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
--we
did,
we
did.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
they
were
fully
briefed
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
context
of
the
dismissal
motion--
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
--no,
they
didn't,
although
they
didn't
address
it
specifically
in
the
context
of
the
medical-necessity
defense.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
well,
it
may
be
better.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
well,
that's
our
position
justice
kennedy
that
the
availability
of
the
medical-necessity
defense
should
await
a
criminal
prosecution
in
which
the
defense
is
asserted
and
evidence
is
presented
and--
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
--well,
our
contention
is
that
you
can
decide
this
court
just
based
on
the
traditional
discretion
that
a
court
of
equity
has
to
allow
this
exception
to
the
injunction.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
well,
the
court
of
appeals
was
saying
that
the
district
court
misconceived
the
law
when
the
court
was
asked
to
modify
the
junction.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
well,
if
you
feel
that
the
court
of
appeals
misconceived
the
law
then
of
course
you're
going
to
have
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals,
but
our
position
is
the
court
of
appeals
was
essentially
correct
on
both
grounds,
that
the
court
does
have
discretion
to
decline
to
enjoin
and
these...
this
conduct
doesn't
violate
the
statute
because
it
comes
within
this
medical
necessity
defense.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
that's
correct.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
well
it's
perfectly--
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
--if
it's
perfectly
consistent
with
the
choice
of
evils
concept
of
the
necessity
defense
because
the
person
who
provides
the
substance
to
the
patient
is
also
faced
with
a
choice
of
evils.
the
case
of
united
states
versus
newcomb
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
on
page
23
makes
it
very
clear
that
this
common
law
necessity
defense
extends
to
the
third-party
provider
as
well.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
of
letting
someone
die
or
violating
the
law.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
well--
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
--we're
saying
the
necessity
defense
permits
or
justifies
this
choice
even
by
the
provider
as
well
as
the
patient.
actually
the
choice
of
evils
defense
as
described
in
the
model
penal
code
offers
this
as
an
example,
a
druggist
may
dispense
a
drug
without
the
requisite
prescription
to
alleviate
grave
distress
in
an
emergency.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
it's
a
very
limited
business
under
this
injunction
which
can
serve
only
patients
who
meet
these
criteria,
and
i
might
point
out
it's
a
business
in
which
the
government
itself
has
been
engaged.
the
government
provides
cannabis
at
the
present
time
to
eight
patients
who
meet
essentially
the
criteria
of
medical
necessity
and--
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
--well,
we're
saying
the
requirement
of
a
prescription
is
not
a
judgment
with
respect
to
the
availability
of
a
necessity
defense.
even
a
drug
as
to
which
no
prescription
is
permitted--
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
--well
the
government's
position
actually
is
that
there
is
no
necessity
defense
for
any
drug
under
the
controlled
substances
act,
and
i
think
it's
very
important
that
the
court
realize
that
the
reason
we're
here
is
because
the
government
shut
down
the
only
program
that
could
accommodate
these
patients.
for
many
years
they
provided
cannabis
and
still
do
for
eight
patients
who
come
within
this
medical
necessity
criteria,
and
they
closed
that
program
down
in
1992
and
they
say
in
their
brief
we
can
do
it
because
we're
the
federal
government.
you
can't
do
it
because
you're
a
private
citizen.
well,
we're
saying
if
you
won't
do
it,
we
can
do
it
because
the
only
justification
you
have
to
do
it
is
the
same
necessity
defense
that
we're
asserting
and
the
way
the
necessity
defense
works
is
if
a
patient
comes
in
and
says
i
have
to
have
this
to
live
and
the
court
says
well,
the
government
has
a
program.
they'll
give
it
to
you.
therefore
you
have
a
reasonable
alternative.
you
don't
have
a
necessity
defense
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
united
states
versus
burton
the
sixth
circuit
case.
a
patient
with
glaucoma
comes
into
court,
asserts
a
necessity
defense.
the
court
says
you
have
a
reasonable
alternative
and
that
patient
then
goes
to
the
government
and
they
put
him
on
the
compassionate
ind
program
and
provide
him
with
cannabis.
well,
now
the
government
decides
we're
not
going
to
operate
that
program
anymore
and
we
say
if
you're
not
going
to
do
it
then
we
can
because
the
only
justification
you
had
to
do
it
was
this
medical
necessity
concept.
there
is
no
authorization
within
the
controlled
substances
act
for
the
government
to
give
cannabis
as
medicine
to
patients
and
when
this
program
was
examined
by
congress,
and
i
especially
invite
the
court
to
carefully
look
at
the
hearings
held
by
congress
on
the
therapeutic
uses
of
marijuana
in
schedule
one
drugs.
the
way
this
program
was
explained
to
congress
in
1980
was
we
are
providing
cannabis
for
medical
use
by
these
patients
and
the
reason
we're
doing
it
is
because
of
compassion
and
because
of
the
therapeutics.
that
was
the
explanation
given
by
congress.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
it
came
out
of
a
settlement
of
a
lawsuit
where
the
patient
successfully
asserted
a
medical
necessity
defense
and
the
federal
authorities
then
stepped
in
and
said
we
will
provide
you
with
the
cannabis
you
need
to
preserve
your
sight.
mr.
gerald
f.
uelmen
this
was
after
he
was
acquitted
he
brought
a
civil
lawsuit
and
in
settlement
of
that
suit
this
program
was
established.
