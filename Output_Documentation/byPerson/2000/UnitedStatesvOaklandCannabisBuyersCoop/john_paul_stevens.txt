justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question
on
that
subject
ms.
underwood?
you
have
a
footnote
in
your
brief,
footnote
11,
that
describes
some
of
the
situations
there
that
gives
the
impression
that
this
whole
case
is
a
sham,
that
it's
really
just
a
front
for
using
marijuana
and
i'm
wondering
if...
and
your
argument
you're
just
making
now
suggests
there
are
always
alternatives.
do
you
think
we
should
take
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
there
really
are
some
people
for
whom
this
is
a
medical
necessity
or
should
we
assume
that
there
are
no
such
people.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question,
does
the
executive,
the
district
attorney
have
prosecutorial
discretion
not
to
bring
a
case
if
he
thinks
a
particular
defendant
really
is
a
person
that
has
this
serious
illness
and
so
forth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
a
judge
have
less
discretion
than
a
prosecutor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
judge
reacts
to
precisely
the
same
reasons
that
motivate
a
prosecutor
not
to
bring
a
case,
would
that
be
an
abuse
of
discretion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
you
can
make
the
same
argument
for
bringing
criminal
prosecution,
so
presumably
you
put
somebody
in
jail,
they'll
stop
doing
it
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes
but
those
are
cases
where
there's
a
legitimate
difference
of
opinion
on
whether
there
was
a
violation
of
law.
your
view
here
that
violation
of
law
is
so
obvious
and
clear
that
there
isn't
even
any
colorable
argument
to
the
contrary.
