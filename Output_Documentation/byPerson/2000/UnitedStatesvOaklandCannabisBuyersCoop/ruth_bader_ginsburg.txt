justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
underwood,
may
i
just
stop
you
there
because
take
one
of
the
examples
that
was
in
the
brief,
the
one
about
the
man
who
was
constantly
vomiting
and
the
only
thing
that
calmed
him
down,
he
had
a
lymphoma
or
something
like
that,
that
is
not
an
uncommon
experience
and
what
surprised
me
about
this
case
was
that
that
kind
of
thing
has
been
going
on,
individual
doctor
prescribing
marijuana
just
to
prevent
that
kind
of
extreme
suffering,
and
that
seemed
to
have
gone
without
enforcement
until
california
passes
this
proposition
and
you
get
clinics
selling
it,
not
individual
doctor.
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
there
has
been
quite
a
bit
of
this
going
on
in
the
medical
profession.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
underwood,
it
would
help
me,
general
underwood,
if
you
would
tell
me
why
the
word
preemption
doesn't
appear
in
the
government's
brief
because
i
took
the
simple-minded
approach
looking
at
this,
congress
says
this
is
a
schedule
one
drug
and
california
says
you
can
have
it
if
you've
got
a
note
from
a
doctor
that
says
you
have
a
migraine
headache.
why
isn't
the
federal
law
that
says
this
is
the
schedule
one
drug
preemptive,
it
must
have
been
with
some
thought
that
you
didn't
use
that
word.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
explain
that
to
me
because
i
thought
to
comply
with
federal
law
you
can't
sell
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
it
says
you'll
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
feds
and
we
won't
go
after
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
one
aspect
of
this
general
underwood
that
respondent
says
and
this
i
think
you
might
know
the
answer
to,
respondent
says
that
overwhelmingly
this
act
is
enforced
by
a
criminal
prosecution
rather
than
civil
injunction.
and
do
you
know
that,
what
is
the
enforcement
practice
with
respect
to
the
csa.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
still
it's
civil
so
it
wouldn't
be
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
it
would
be
i
think
it's
clear
and
convincing
in
this
case;
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
understood
you
before
in
answer
to
the
question
about
why
the
civil
injunction
to
say
that
you
wouldn't
do
that
with
a
street
peddler
but
you
want
to
put
this
clinic
out
of
business.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
wasn't
any
failure
to
rule
on
what
the
law
is
in
both
of
those
cases.
the
judge
adjudicated
the
case
and
said
you
did
wrong,
but
i'm
not
going
to
slap
you
with
an
injunction
because
in
the
bowles
case
it
was
inadvertent
and
i
have
ever
reason
to
believe
you
won't
do
it
again.
i
didn't
get
from
any
of
the
cases
you
cite
authority
that
a
judge
would
have
to
say,
i'm
just
not
going
to
participate
in
the
adjudication
of
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
action
is
brought
against
the
clinic
not
against
the
individual
sufferers,
so
you
seem
to
be
putting
together
two
things
that
don't
mix,
you're
saying
that
an
individual
might
have
a
plea
of
medical
necessity,
but
the
judge
who
is
faced
with
a
clinic
that's
selling
to
all
kinds
of
people,
some
of
them
don't
fit
that
description
at
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
understand
you
correctly
mr.
uelmen
from
what
you've
argued
about
medical
necessity,
the
california
initiative
is
essentially
irrelevant
because
you'd
be
making
the
same
argument
in
any
state;
is
that
correct.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
congress
were
to
say
we
don't
want
a
medical...
we
didn't...
we
thought
controlled
substance
schedule
one
is
prohibited.
now
we're
going
to
make
clear
there's
no
medical-necessity
defense
then
what
happens
to
your--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
it
came
out
of
a
settlement
of
a
lawsuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
successfully
in
what
way
did
the
plaintiff
get
a
judgment
in
that
case?
