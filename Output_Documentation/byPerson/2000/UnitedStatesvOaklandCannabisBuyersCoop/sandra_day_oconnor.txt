it
seems
to
me
what
happened
here
is
that
it
originally
went
to
a
federal
district
court
judge
who
granted
an
injunction
and
then
it
was
appealed--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--at
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
appeared
at
least
to
create
some
kind
of
a
blanket
exception
to
the
provisions
of
the
controlled
substances
act
and
returned
it
to
the
district
court
which
it
required
to
withdraw
or
to
enter.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
was
a
kind
of
a
blanket
medical-necessity
defense
that
it
recognized
when
i
would
have
thought
that
the
initial
trial
judge
did
not
abuse
his
discretion
at
all
and
that
the
ninth
circuit
erred
at
the
point
that
it
created
this
blanket
defense.
