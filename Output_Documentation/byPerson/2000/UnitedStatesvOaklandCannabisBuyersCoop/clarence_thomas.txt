justice
clarence
thomas
i
have
the
opinion
in
the
united
states
versus
oakland
cannabis
buyers
cooperative.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
respondent
oakland
cannabis
buyers
cooperative
was
organized
to
distribute
marijuana
to
qualified
patients
for
medical
purposes.
the
united
states
sought
to
enjoin
the
cooperative’s
efforts
under
the
controlled
substances
act,
which
prohibits
the
manufacture
and
distribution
of
certain
drugs
including
marijuana.
the
district
court
granted
the
government’s
request
for
a
preliminary
injunction.
the
court
then
rejected
the
cooperative’s
motion
to
modify
the
injunction
to
permit
distributions
that
are
medically
necessary.
the
cooperative
appealed
and
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court’s
ruling
on
the
motion
to
modify
the
injunction.
according
to
the
ninth
circuit,
medical
necessity
is
a
legally
cognizable
defense
to
the
statute’s
prescriptions.
the
ninth
circuit
also
concluded
that
the
district
court
could
have
issued
an
injunction
more
limited
in
scope
than
the
controlled
substances
act,
and
thus
instructed
the
district
court
to
consider
the
criteria
for
the
medical
necessity
exception.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
and
remand.
we
hold
that
there
was
no
medical
necessity
exception
to
the
controlled
substances
act’s
prohibition
on
manufacturing
and
distributing
marijuana.
under
any
conception
of
legal
necessity,
the
defense
cannot
succeed
when
the
legislature
itself
has
made
a
determination
of
values.
here
the
act
reflects
a
determination
that
marijuana
has
no
medical
benefits
meriting
an
exception.
whereas,
other
drugs
can
be
dispensed
and
prescribed
for
medical
use,
the
same
is
not
true
for
marijuana,
which
according
to
the
act,
has
no
currently
accepted
medical
use.
the
ninth
circuit
erred
in
instructing
the
district
court
to
consider
the
criteria
for
medical
necessity
exception
when
fashioning
the
injunction.
although
district
courts
that
are
properly
acting
as
courts
of
equity
generally
have
discretion
in
designing
relief.
they
cannot
ignore
congress’
judgment
expressed
explicitly
in
legislation.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment,
which
justices
souter
and
ginsburg
have
joined.
justice
breyer
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
