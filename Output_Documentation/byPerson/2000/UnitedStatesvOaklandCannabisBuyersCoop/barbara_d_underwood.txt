ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
controlled
substances
act
prohibits
the
distribution
of
marijuana
outside
federally
authorized
research
programs
because
congress,
the
attorney
general
and
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
have
each
determined
that
there
is
no
currently
accepted
medical
use
for
the
drug,
and
it
has
a
high
potential
for
abuse.
the
statute
also
recognizes
that
new
information
might
come
to
light
that
would
justify
less
restrictive
controls
so
it
establishes
administrative
procedure
for
changing
the
classification
and
the
restrictions
for
marijuana
and
other
controlled
substances.
that
statutory
scheme
leaves
no
room
for
the
oakland
cannabis
buyers'
cooperative
to
distribute
marijuana
without
the
approval
of
the
attorney
general
under
a
claim
of
medical
necessity,
and
it
leaves
no
room
for
a
court
to
consider
such
a
claim
as
a
basis
for
refusing
to
enjoin
the
marijuana
operations
of
the
cooperative.
the
ninth
circuit's
ruling
in
effect
authorizes
the
operation
of
marijuana
pharmacies
outside
the
safeguards
and
restrictions
of
the
act
and
undermines
the
ability
of
the
act
to
protect
the
public
from
hazardous
drugs.
the
common
law
defense
of
necessity
can
sometimes
authorize
a
person
to
violate
the
law
in
order
to
avoid
a
more
serious
harm
but
it
doesn't
apply
here
for
three
reasons.
first,
because
the
legislature
has
already
balanced
the
harms
and
come
to
a
different
conclusion.
congress
anticipated
there
would
be
claims
of
medical
uses
for
controlled
substances
and
provided
an
administrative
procedure
for
evaluating
them
allowing
trial
judges
and
juries
to
redetermine
that
balance
in
individual
cases
would
undermine
the
procedure
established
by
congress.
second,
because
the
defense
has
no
application
because
the
co-ops
members
and
the
co-op
itself
have
alternatives
to
violating
the
criminal
law.
they
have
substantive
alternatives,
other
lawful
medications
including
a
synthetic
form
of
the
active
ingredient
of
marijuana.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
the...
on
the
assumption
that
there
are
no
such
people
because
the
food
and
drug
administration
charged
with
evaluating
the
medical...
the
scientific
information
and
the
dea,
that
is
the
agency
that
report
to
the
attorney
general
and
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
having
evaluated
the
claims
of
medical
use
have
found
that
there
is
no
accepted
medical
use,
that
some
of
the
claims
of
medical
use
are
simply
wrong.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
the
record
doesn't
reflect
and
i
don't
know
how
much
of
it
has
been
going
on.
i
think
there
are
two
things
to
say
in
response
to
that
though,
one
is
that
the
agencies
charged
with
evaluating
the
medical
uses
here
have
ongoing
studies
and
have
so
far
concluded
that
there
are...
that
the
particular
use
that
you're
describing
is
best
served...
there's
now
an
extract
of
marijuana
that's
been
on
the
market...
been
available
and
been
put
on
the
lower
schedule
than
schedule
one
for
15
or
16
years
which
is
this
marinol
and
efforts
are
being
made
to
find
other
methods
of
administering
the
pure
substance
and
determining
whether
it
has
the
effect
that's
described.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well
the
determination
that's
been
made
is
that
the
medical
utility
of
it
has
not
been
established
which
is
a
slightly
different
way
of
putting
it
but
there
is
a
separate
determination
the
fda
makes
determinations
as
it
does
with
substances
that
aren't
on
the
controlled
substances
list,
that
is
there
are
new
drugs
that
are
proposed
all
the
time
which
might
possibly
be
useful
and
aren't
authorized
for
use
until
after
tests
satisfy
the
fda
that
the
drug
is
safe
and
effective
for
use
and
marijuana
has
not
passed
that
screen.
there
is
an
additional
screen
for
controlled
substances
that
is
in
addition
to
considering
and
the
scheduling
decision
takes
into
account
not
just
medical
utility
but
also
the
potential
for
abuse,
but
the
fda's
role
in
it,
the
health
and
human
services
role
in
it
is
just
to
assess
or
it
has
a
role
in
simply
assessing
the
medical
evidence
and
has
concluded
that
to
date
there
is
insufficient
reason
to
think
that
it
is
a
safe
and
effective
drug
although
there
are
continuing
research
projects
going
on
to
try
and
pursue
the
anecdotal
information
that
it
is
sometimes
helpful
or
that
components
of
marijuana
are
sometimes
helpful.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well
the
california
law
doesn't
actually
purport
to
authorize
the
distribution
of
marijuana
with
a
doctor's
note,
it
provides
a
defense
to
california
law.
now
it
is
true
that
an
effort
is
being
made
here
to
invoke
the
judgment
behind
that
law
as
in
support
of
the
claim
of
medical
necessity,
but
california
didn't
purport
to
create
a
defense
to
federal
law
as
it
couldn't
have
if
it
had
tried
it
would
have
been
presumably
preemptive...
preempted.
but
it's
perfectly
possible
to
comply
with
both
california
law
and
federal
law.
there
isn't
that
kind
of
conflict
here.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well
that's
right
but
california
law
doesn't
require
you
to
sell
it.
it
simply
says
that
you
won't
be...
california
could
remove
the...
could
eliminate--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
and
i
should
say
that
the
decision
of
the
federal
agencies
not
to
accept
the
kind
of
anecdotal
evidence
that
you're
suggesting
is
a
decision
that
the
federal...
the
food
and
drug
administration
has
made
again
not
just
in
the
controlled
substance
area
but
it
has
concluded
that
the
anecdotal
reports
of
individuals
are
a
basis
for
research,
a
reason
to
conduct
research
and
not
a
basis
for
authorizing
the
use
of
a
drug
or
changing
its
scheduling.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes.
there
are
grounds
on
which
a
court
can
deny
injunctive
relief.
for
example,
if
the
court
found
that
violations
had
stopped
and
are
unlikely
to
recur
and
an
injunction
wasn't
necessary
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
act,
this
court
noted
that
in
hecht
against
bowles,
and
there
may
be
other
grounds
but
i
would
say
that
the
judge
who
said
what
you
just
said
would
be,
in
fact,
intruding
on
article
ii
executive
prerogatives
by
insisting
that
when
congress
has
provided
both
civil
and
criminal
enforcement
mechanisms
as
it
often
does
that
the
executive
is
not
free
to
choose
the
enforcement
mechanism,
the
civil
enforcement
mechanism
that--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--there's
always
prosecutorial
discretion.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
the
judge
has
different
discretion
from
a
prosecutor,
it
is
for
the
prosecutor
to
decide
whether
a
case
merits
prosecution
or
whether
a
civil
injunction
is
worth
bringing.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes
it
would.
the
court's
role
in
the
process
is
not
the
executive's
role.
the
court
cannot
deny
an
injunction
on
the
grounds
that
the
executive
should
for
instance
have
chosen
the
criminal
sanction
or
should
not
have
brought
the
case
at
all.
if--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well
no
the
contempt
actions
of
him
would
be
brought
by
prosecutor
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
why
civil--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--there's
a
reason
why
civil
injunctive
enforcement
is
authorized
and
why
it's
appropriate.
i
don't
think
it's
for
the
court
to
second-guess
the
prosecutor
but
there
is
a
reason.
the
civil
injunctive
remedy
in
this
statute
was
patterned
on
a
similar
provision
in
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act,
and
the
purpose
of
that
was
to
provide
a
way
to
resolve
legal
disputes
without
the
harshness
of
a
criminal
prosecution.
this
is
just
that
kind
of
dispute,
open
and
ongoing
violations
of
the
law
designed
to
test
its
statute
with
the
california
state
law
in
the
background,
once...
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
once
a
court
resolves
the
question
that...
holds,
for
instance,
that
there
is
no
medical
necessity
defense
or
holds
that
in
any
event
whatever
medical
necessity
defense
there
might
be
doesn't
authorize
the
operations
of
marijuana
pharmacies
as
in
this
case,
that
the
oakland
cannabis
buyers'
cooperative
won't
comply
with
the
law.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
not
if
the
statute
authorizes
a
civil
injunctive
remedy
and...
but
i
would
like--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--excuse
me.
i
misspoke.
that
would
not
be--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion.
it
would
not
be
an
appropriate
ground
for
withholding
injunctive
relief
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
statute,
this
statute,
perhaps
out
of
a
concern
like
that
or
perhaps
for
some
other
reason,
contains
a
jury
trial
requirement...
provides
a
jury
trial
for
a
trial
of
the
contempt
of
an
injunction
that
is
obtained--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--yes.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
i
have
no
information
about
that
but
i
would
like
to
point--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--i
was
not...
i
don't
have
the
answer
to
that
question
but
i
know--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--i
should
think
so.
i
would
just
like
to--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--i
know
that
civil
injunctions
have
been
used
on
other...
exactly
on
occasions
under
this
statute
as
well
as
under
other
statutes
where
there
is
a
business
enterprise
going
on
that
has
a
dispute
with
the
government
about
whether
what
they're
doing
is
outside
the
statute.
i
don't
think
it's--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--that's
correct
but...
and
under
this
statute
in
particular
though
the
controlled
substances
act
it
is
not
customary
to
seek
injunctions
against
street
dealers
of
narcotics
but
it
is
customary
to
seek
injunctions
against,
for
instance,
manufacturing
plants
that
are
claiming
that
their
use
of
particular
chemicals
is...
what
they're
doing
is
within
the
act
or
without
the
act,
i
mean,
when
there
is
essentially
a
dispute
with
the
business
enterprise
about
the
legality
and
propriety
of
what
they're
doing
and
that
is
actually
not
just
under
the
controlled
substances
act
but
under
many
statutes,
the
kind
of
occasion
when
an
injunction
is
used
to
resolve
the
legal
dispute
on
the
assumption
that
once
that
legal
dispute
is
resolved
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
seek
further
enforcement
but
there
will
be--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--yes,
but
what
congress
said
actually
in
authorizing
injunctive
relief
is
that
when
there
is
this
kind
of
dispute
it
is
desirable
to
provide
a
mechanism
for
resolving
it
without
putting
people
at
risk
of
going
to
jail
if...
and
that's
one--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--no,
it
does
not.
i'm
referring
to
legislative
history
actually--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
i'm
actually
referring
to
legislative
history
of
the
food,
drug...
of
the
analog
provision
in
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
simply
to
suggest
not
that
we
know
that
that's
what
congress
voted
on
but
that
that
is
a
common
widely-understood
reason--
--that
is
a
common
widely-understood
reason--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--that's
our
view
but
there
is
a
claim
to
the
contrary
and
i
don't
think
it
requires
that
we
credit
that
claim
to
decide
that
an
appropriate
way
to
resolve
that
dispute
is
in
a
civil
enforcement
action,
and
that...
so
that's
the
story
about
when
we
sometimes
use
civil
enforcement
actions.
actually
very
often...
respondent
has
suggested
that
it's
hardly
ever
used
because
there
aren't
reported
opinions,
the
most
common
occasion
where
civil
enforcement
actions
are
used
they're
also
settled.
that
is,
the
injunction...
the
complaint
is
filed
and
there's
a
civil
settlement
involving
money
and
agreements
to
change
practices
and
make
an
agreement
not
to
deal
in
a
particular
drug,
chemical
for
some
period
of
time.
there
are
numerous
examples
of
that.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
for
example,
here,
where
we
are
arguing
where
it
is
our
position
that
there
simply
is
no
medical-necessity
defense
at
all
and
therefore
that
one
shouldn't
be
entertaining
evidence
and
adjudicating
the
appropriateness
of
a
medical-necessity
defense
in
a
particular
case,
the
way
to
get
that
resolved
systemically
is
in
a
civil...
a
civil
proceeding
that
simply
presents
that
legal
question.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
it
is
a
part
of
our
argument--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--it
isn't
necessary
to
reach
that
result
but
it
is
a
part
of
our
argument
that
the
reason
the
injunction...
the
reason
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
to
suggest
that
the
injunction
might
not
issue
or
might
be
limited
that
the
court
predicated
that
holding
on
an
error
of
law,
i
mean
one...
there
are
many
reasons
why
a
court
might
exercise
its
discretion
but
it
is
not
a
good
reason
to
exercise
its
discretion
to
rely
on
a
mistake
of
law
and
a
mistaken
view
of
the
law
and
that
mistake
is
that
the
controlled
substances
act
authorizes,
contemplates
or
is
consistent
with
a
medical-necessity
defense.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
i
would
say
that's
the
result
of
what
the
ninth
circuit--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--pardon
me?
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
our
initial
position
was
not
that
we
wanted
to
bring
this
to
the
united
states
supreme
court
but
that
the
practice...
that
the
oakland
cannabis
buyers'
cooperative
and
similar
cooperatives
should
be
enjoined
from
engaging
in
the
open
and
notorious
violation
of
the
controlled
substances
act--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
the
statute
calls
for
enforcement
by
contempt.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well
there's
a...
no,
well,
there's
a
civil
contempt
in
the
statute.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes,
i
said
earlier
the
defendant
by
statute
is
entitled
to
a
jury.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
it's
not
a
criminal
proceeding
it's
a
trial
under
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--the
statute's
section
882
says
in
case
of
an
alleged
violation
of
an
injunction
or
a
restraining
order
issued
under
this
section,
trial
shall
upon
demand
of
the
accused
be
by
a
jury
under
the...
in
accordance
with
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
that's
what
congress
contemplated
and
instructed.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
want
to
stop
it
from
engaging
in
the
unlawful
distribution
of
marijuana,
it
might
have
some
other
business,
but
i
don't
believe
the
oakland
cannabis
buyers'
cooperative
at
the
moment
is
engaged
in
other
businesses,
and
as
i've
said,
that's
the
dispute
that
we
have
with
the
oakland
cannabis
buyers'
cooperative
about
whether
what
they're
doing
is
lawful
or
not
is
one
that
is
ideally
suited
to
resolution
in
a
civil...
in
a
civil
litigation.
i
think
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
a
medical
necessity
defense
is
foreclosed
here
not
only
by
the
fact
that
congress
contemplated
and
rejected
it
and
not
only
by
the
fact
that
alternatives
are
available
but
also
because
any
necessity
defense
is
a
response
to
unusual
and
unforeseen
circumstances.
it
couldn't
possibly,
the
common
law
necessity
defense
couldn't
possibly
authorize
an
ongoing
enterprise
designed
to
stand
ready
and
provide
supplies
to
people
who
might
show
up
with
their
own
individual
claims
of
medical
necessity.
there's
no
constitutional
problem
with
the
statutory
procedure
for
deciding
when
and
if
medical
uses
for
a
drug
exist
where
with...
and
the
court
held
in
weinberger
against
hynson
that
it's
perfectly
appropriate
for
the
fda
to
reject
anecdotal
evidence
and
insist
on
controlled
studies.
there's
also
no
problem
with
protecting
sick
people
from
charlatans
or
unsafe
and
ineffective
drugs
as
this
court
held
in
rutherford
in
dealing
with
laetrile
the
claim
that
there
was
a
right
to
use
laetrile.
respondents
in
this
case
have
never
presented
their
claims,
the
claims
they're
making
here,
to
the
fda.
they've
never
sought

of
the
classification
of

to,
at

so

the
record

trials
that
are
ongoing

to
deal
with
synthetic

seeking
fines
or
incarceration,

judge
wasn't
contemplating
fines
or
incarceration
but
just
evicting
and
padlocking,
closing
down
this
business.
