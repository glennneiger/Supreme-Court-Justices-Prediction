--well,
your...
what's
left
of
the...
what's
in
the
shell,
i
guess,
is
a
kind
of
interrorum
jurisdiction
to,
in
effect
to
guarantee
the
concessions,
and
it
may
never
have
to
be...
presumably
it
will
never
have
to
be
exercised,
but
you're
conceding
that
it
could
be.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
to
keep
it
simple,
on
res
judicata
they
could
simply
enjoin
collection
beyond
the
conceded
limitation.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
