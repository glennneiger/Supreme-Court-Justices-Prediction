chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
1999...
correction,
1331,
james
lewis
v.
lewis
&
clark
marine.
mr.
dripps.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
true
of
both
the
jones
act
and
fela,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
you
have
excess
funds,
multiple,
and
the
jones
act?
are
you
saying
that
the
jones
act
would
prevent
a
liability
determination
in
all
of
those
situations?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
possible
to
rule
for
you
here
without
holding
that
rule
(f)
is
invalid
just
as
a
matter
of
interpretation,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
defendant
cannot
ask
for
a
jury
trial
in
that
situation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
it's
one
thing
to
say,
for
congress
to
say
it
can't
be
removed,
but
it
seems
to
me
it's
quite
another,
a
separate
thing
for
congress
to
say
that
the
plaintiff
can
have
a
nonjury
trial
and
the
defendant
cannot
move
for
a
jury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
well,
it
certainly
isn't
directly
involved
here,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
said
in
singer,
that
singer
case,
in
the
criminal
case
that
the
government
can
move
for
a
jury
trial
even
though
the
defendant
doesn't
want
one.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
it
meets
every
test.
it
meets
every
test
for
being
procedural,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
being
substantive?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
dripps.
mr.
o'brien,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
the
district
court's
view
would
have
been
different
had
the
right
to
jury
trial
not
been
given
up?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
this
case
hinges,
in
your
view
at
any
rate,
on
the
fact
that
the
plaintiff
had
waived
the
right
to
a
jury
trial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
provision
of
the
limitation
act
gives
you
the
right
to
have
an
exoneration
proceeding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
where
is
that
in
the
appendix?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
see
it's
at
pages
1
and
2
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
pursuing
the
limitation
of
liability
is
one
thing.
getting
an
exoneration
determination
is
another.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
norwich,
for
example,
under
the
norwich
was
decided
long
before
the
jones
act
was
passed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
jones
act
affects
the
holding
in
norwich
in
any
way?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
why
do
you
say
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
langnes
says
the
single
claimant
is
different,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
request
for
a
jury
trial
was
essential
to
the
holding
in
langnes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
about
the
practical
advantage
of
a
plaintiff
who
thinks
he's
going
to
get
a
better
verdict
in
madison
county,
illinois,
than
he
will
in
the
federal
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
missouri?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
so.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
now,
are
you
saying
that
in
the
single
claimant,
stipulated
claim
less
than
the
value
of
the
vessel,
we
would
have
to
overrule
cases
in
order
to
rule
against
you
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
that's
what
you
just
did
say.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
o'brien.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
dripps,
you
have
6
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dripps.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-1331,
lewis
versus
lewis
&
clark
marine
inc.
will
be
announced
by
justice
oâ€™connor.
