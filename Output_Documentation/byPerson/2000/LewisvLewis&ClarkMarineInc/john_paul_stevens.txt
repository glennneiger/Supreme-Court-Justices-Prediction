justice
john
paul
stevens
but
wasn't
that
only
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
jurisdiction
under...
just
to
seek
limitation?
as
part
of
the
proceeding
they
could
seek
exoneration,
but
was
there
any
case
where
the
only
issue
was
exoneration
versus
liability?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
word
exoneration
is
not
in
the
statute
itself,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
wouldn't
all
these
cases
fit
together
if
we
simply
held
that
in
an
appropriate
case
where
the
limitation
of
liability
proceeding
involves
multiple
claimants
and
an
original
intent
to
get
more
than
the
gross
value
of
the
ship,
that
in
such
a
case,
the...
among
the
things
the
shipowner
can
do
is
seek
a
complete
defense
of
a
nonliability?
wouldn't
all
the
cases
fit
together
if
we
just
held
that's
where
the
exoneration
is
appropriate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
really
is
whether
that
did
not
satisfy
the
purposes
of
the
limitation
of
liability
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
statutory
right
that
he's
talking
about,
there's
two
ways
to
define
it.
one
is
the
savings
to
suitors
clause
itself
is
a
statutory
right.
he's
entitled
to
invoke
that,
and
it
doesn't
really
say,
only
if
he's
seeking
a
jury
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
of
course,
can't
you
just
read
that
as
the...
this
is
a
particularly
strong
reason
for
vindicating
the
plaintiff's
right
to
choose
his
own
forum,
that
in
one
forum
he
gets
a
jury
and
in
the
other
he
doesn't?
that
makes
it
a
very
appealing
case,
but
i
don't
think
you
can
necessarily
deduce
from
that
the
conclusion
that
he
wouldn't
also
have
a
right
to
pick
the
forum
of
his
own
choice
without
that
feature.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
gets
the
same
remedy
whether
it's
a
jury
trial
or
a
bench
trial.
he's
seeking
damages.
that's
the
remedy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i...
go
ahead.
that's
all
right.
