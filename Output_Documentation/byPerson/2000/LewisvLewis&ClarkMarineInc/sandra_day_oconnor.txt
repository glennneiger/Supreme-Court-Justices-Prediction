well,
under
what
circumstances
could
the
district
court
exercise
its
discretion
and
not
dissolve
the
injunction
and
require
litigation
of
liability
in
federal
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
the
courts
and
rule
(f)
preclude
a
single
claimant
exception?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
think
that
rule
(f)
is
invalid?

this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
the
petitioner
james
lewis
claims
he
was
injured
while
on
board
the
respondent
lewis
&
clark
ship
while
working
as
a
deckhand.
the
petitioner
sued
the
respondent
for
his
injuries
in
the
illinois
state
court.
the
petitioner
did
not
ask
for
a
jury
trial.
in
anticipation
of
petitioner’s
lawsuit,
the
respondent
ship
owner
filed
a
complaint
in
federal
district
court
under
the
limitation
of
liability
act.
the
limitation
act
grants
vessel
owners
the
right
to
seek
limited
liability
in
federal
court
for
claims
of
damage
aboard
their
vessels.
another
federal
statute
grants
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
federal
courts
over
admiralty
and
maritime
claims,
but
that
statute
also
has
a
clause
that
saves
the
suitors
like
petitioners,
their
choice
of
remedies
including
remedies
in
the
state
court.
the
federal
district
court
noted
the
potential
tension
between
the
limitation
act
and
the
saving
to
suitors
clause.
the
district
court
eventually
allowed
the
petitioner
to
proceed
with
his
claims
in
state
court
after
the
petitioner
provided
certain
stipulations
and
waivers
assuring
the
district
court
that
respondent’s
right
to
seek
limitation
of
liability
in
federal
court
would
be
protected.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court,
concluding
that
litigation
should
have
continued
in
the
federal
court.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
respondent
had
a
right
to
ask
for
exoneration
from
liability
not
just
limitation
of
liability
in
federal
court.
the
court
of
appeals
also
held
that
because
petitioner
did
not
ask
for
a
jury
trial
in
state
court,
he
had
not
sought
a
saved
remedy
under
the
saving
to
suitors
clause.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
eighth
circuit.
as
the
courts
although
recognized
there
is
tension
between
the
limitation
act
and
the
saving
to
suitors
clause.
the
limitation
act
allows
vessel
owners
like
respondent
to
seek
limited
liability
in
federal
court.
the
saving
to
suitors
clause
gives
suitors
like
petitioner
their
choice
of
remedy
including
remedies
in
state
court.
the
tension
arises
when
the
vessel
owner
wants
to
proceed
in
federal
court
and
the
injured
suitor
wants
to
proceed
in
state
court.
we
believe
that
district
court
properly
resolved
that
tension
in
this
case
by
allowing
the
petitioner
to
proceed
with
his
claims
in
state
court
after
having
protected
respondent’s
right
to
seek
limited
liability.
the
court
of
appeals
contrary
conclusion
had
two
defects
we
think:
first,
the
limitation
act
does
not
give
vessel
owners
the
right
to
seek
exoneration
from
liability
where
limitation
of
liability
is
not
at
issue;
second,
suitors
like
the
petitioner
have
the
right
to
their
choice
of
remedies
in
state
court
not
just
the
choice
of
a
jury
trial.
the
decision
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
