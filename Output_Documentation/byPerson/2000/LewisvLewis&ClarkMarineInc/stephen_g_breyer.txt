justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
i
read
it,
you're
trying...
you
seem
to
be
trying
to
make
the
tail
wag
the
dog.
these
early
cases
say,
well,
you
know,
if
you're
in
federal
court,
shipowner,
trying
to
limit
your
liability,
because
we've
had
a
collision
and
there
are
42,000
plaintiffs
and
you've
got
to
deal
with
this
and
just
limit
it
to
the
vessel,
well,
as
long
as
you're
there,
we'll
try
out
whether
you're
liable
at
all.
we'll
try
out
exoneration.
the
only
reason
we're
doing
that...
they
didn't
do
it
in
england,
but
the
court
says...
we
say,
from
time
immemorial
it
was
done
in
every
other
country,
right?
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
we'll
do
it.
but
if
you're
not
here,
what's
the
point
of
doing
it,
and
you're
not
here
if
there's
a
single
plaintiff
or
if
there's
an
adequate
fund.
i
mean,
the
reasoning
of
it
would
seem
to
me
to
be,
if
you're
not
here,
and
you
can't
get
here
because
there's
an
adequate
fund,
for
example,
there's
no
reason
for
us
to
snatch
the
issue
of
liability
away
from
the
state
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course
that's
true,
provided
that
you
are
properly
in
the
federal
court
limiting
your
liability.
my
point
is,
suppose
you're
not,
as
is
true
here,
for
the
reason
that
you
already
have
an
adequate
fund.
you
have
no
basis
to
get
into
the
federal
court
if
there's
an
adequate
fund.
your
only
basis
could
be
that
we
want
to
exonerate,
but
exoneration
is
there
in
case
you're
in
anyway.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
would
that
be?
i
mean,
let's
suppose
that
a
jones
act
plaintiff
does...
could
go...
he
could
get
into
federal
admiralty
court.
he
could
get
in,
or
he
could
do
what
he'd
prefer
to
do,
which
is
to
file
in
the
state.
why
shouldn't
he
be
able
to
file
in
the
state
unless
there's
some
federal
reason
that
prefers
the
federal
tribunal?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
i
mean,
you're
making
both
arguments.
one
argument
is
that
there
is
a
federal
reason
and
the
federal
reason
is
the
exoneration,
and
that's
countered
with
the
argument
that
there
is
no
federal
reason
where
there
isn't
an
independent
reason
for
being
in
the
limitation
action,
all
right,
so
i'm
taking
the
other
part.
let's
assume
there
is
no
federal
reason.
if
there
is
no
federal
reason...
he
has
the
right
come
in
the
door,
but
there's
no
federal
preference.
why
shouldn't
he
be
able
to
go
to
the
state
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
you
didn't,
if
there
were
no
reason
favoring
the
federal
court,
then
would
you
say,
give
him
his
choice?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
but
if
you're
prepared
to
go
that
far,
then
the
case
turns
on
whether
there
is
a
federal
reason,
and
the
federal
reason
you
say
is
exoneration,
so
i
understand
that.
and
then
i'm
back
to
the
question
i
had
before,
which
i'm
not
sure
i
had
a
satisfactory
answer
to
totally,
that
really
what
this
exoneration
is
is
the
tail
and
it
follows
the
dog
into
the
federal
court,
and
the
only
reason
it's
ever
there
was,
historically
in
england
they
did
this,
what
the
courts
thought
were
absurd,
to
force
the
shipowner
to
give
up
his
right
to
exoneration
in
order
to
get
in
federal
court,
and
our
court
years
ago
said
that's
silly,
no
other
country
does
that
and
we're
not
going
to
do
it.
