justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
might
not...
but
it
might
not
go
that
far
if
you
had
a
mass
disaster
and
there
were
many
sailors
injured
and
the
vessel
wasn't
worth
enough
to
cover
all
the
claims.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
also--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
understand
the
limitation
correctly?
i
mean,
the
typical
use
would
be
if
you
have
a
collision
and
lots
of
people
are
hurt,
but
this
is
a
single...
this
is
a
tripping
on
wire,
so
we
know
it
isn't...
it
isn't
disputed
in
this
case,
is
it,
that
we're
dealing
with
a
single
sailor
accident?
there
was...
he
tripped
over
a
wire
on
the
deck.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
sued
later.
oh,
you
think
that
they
came
in
precipitously
so
that
the
forum
would
be
where
they
wanted
it,
rather
than
where
you
chose
to
sue?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
their
limitation
proceeding
was
filed
in
which
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
was...
seemed
to
be
a
concession
that
if
only
you
had
asked
for
a
jury
trial
you'd
be
home
free,
because
you
can't
get
a
jury
trial
in
admiralty
and
that's
what
the
savings
to
suitors
clause
saved.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
have
you
conceded
with
respect
to
the
limitation
forum,
because
there'll
be
nothing...
there'll
be
nothing...
the
only...
this
is
the
only
lawsuit,
this
jones...
this
is
the
only
claim,
so
they
have
a
shell
of
an
action,
but
there's
nothing
to
fill
the
shell
because
this
case
will
go
on
in
the
state
court,
there'll
be
a
decision,
there's
more
than
enough
money
in
the
till
to
pay
the
judgment,
so
what
have
you
conceded
by
letting
them
keep
the
limitation
action?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
your...
that's
your
concession,
that
your
claim
is
for
less
than
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
correctly
understand
the
picture
on
this
exoneration
that
would
go
on
if
you...
say
you
did
have
a
collision,
would
go
on
in
the
admiralty
forum,
that
the
function
is
served
by
the
defense
that
the
shipowner
can
put
into
the
jones
act
claim
that
is,
there
was
no
negligence
here,
and
that
is
effectively
what
the
exoneration
plea
would
do?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
from
the
shipowner's
point
of
view,
it's
one
thing
to
say
the
shipowner
itself
had
no
involvement
in
the
negligence,
it
was
the
other
deck
hands.
it's
a
respondeat
superior
situation.
that's
one
thing.
another
thing
is,
there
was
no
negligence
by
anybody
at
all,
and
i
thought
that
that
was
the
equivalent
of
the
exoneration
plea,
that
nobody
was
negligent
at
all,
as
distinguished
from,
maybe
we
have
respondeat
superior
liability,
but
we
should
be
allowed
to
limit
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that
i
don't
follow,
because
if
there
was
a
determination
of
exoneration,
that
is,
no
liability
at
all,
not
limited
but
no
liability
at
all,
why
wouldn't
that
have
been
preclusive
in
state
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ah.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
determination?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
the
federal
court
had
made
the
determination
first,
and
that...
and
hadn't
been
reversed,
then
that
would
be
preclusive.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that
sounds
like,
entirely
in
sync
with
my
suggestion
that
the
defense
of
no
negligence
at
all,
which
can
be
put
into
the
jones
act
proceeding,
is
the
equivalent
of
getting,
in
the
federal
court,
exoneration.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
following
your
argument
to
this
extent.
i
thought
all
this
came
up
originally
not
because
of
statutes,
but
because
of
court
made
doctrine
in
admiralty,
and
then
that
doctrine
gets
reflected
eventually
into
rule
(f).
it's
not
a
like
a
rule
in
place
of
a
statute,
where
i
would
follow
your
argument
very
well,
but
it
is
taking
what
was,
indeed,
substantive
law,
but
substantive
law
originally
made
up
by
courts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
say
that
because
you
say,
well
then
he
doesn't
need
the
state
forum
because
he
can
get
a
nonjury
trial
in
admiralty,
but
wouldn't
one
say
equally,
once
the
jones
act
plaintiff
stipulates
that
he's
not
going
to
seek
more
than
x
amount
of
damages,
you
don't
need
the
limitation
proceeding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'd
like
to
back
up
a
little
bit,
because
i
don't
think
i
followed
you
that
far
down
the
trail.
that
is,
as
i
understand
it,
the
whole
reason
for
being
of
a
limitation
action
is
so
that
the
shipowner
will
be
able
to
limit
the
extent
of
his
economic
loss
to
the
value
of
the
ship.
now,
once
it
is
certain
that
that
will
in
fact
be
the
case,
that
there
is
no
exposure
beyond
the
value
of
the
ship,
what
function
does
a
limitation
proceeding
save...
serve,
other
than
to
block
what
would
ordinarily
be
a
garden
variety
jones
act
case
from
proceeding
in
whatever
forum
the
sailor
chooses
to
sue
in?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
were
any
of
those
cases
single
claimant
cases
where
the
fund
was
adequate
to
cover
the
injury,
or
were
they
all
what
one
thinks
of
as
limitation
case,
a
rather
larger
disaster?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
did
you
know
that,
because
the
federal
suit
was
filed
second.
you
had
your
limitation...
if
i
remember
the
chronology
right,
you
sought
limitation,
and
then
a
week
later
the
jones
act
case
was
started.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
plaintiff--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--this
plaintiff
hadn't
made
any
such
claim
then.
you're
basing
it
on
other
claims
that
were
made
against
this
shipowner?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
brought
it
up
in
answer
to
your
assertion,
we
knew
that
he
originally
had
a
claim
in
excess
of
the
value
of
the
vessel.
you
didn't
know
that
specifically
with
respect
to
this
plaintiff.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
didn't
have
to
make
any
prediction
a
week
later.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
prayer
for
relief
was
for
in
excess
of
450,000
dollars?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
understand
you,
then,
that
the
vessel
owner
in
every
case
where
the
sailor
chooses
to
sue
in
state
court
and
not
ask
for
a
jury
trial
the
vessel
owner
can
always
pick
the
forum
instead
by
filing
a
limitation
proceeding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what...
you
told
me
that
the
only
thing
that's
preserved
is
jury
trial,
not
the
jones
act
claim,
which
is
what
i
would
have
thought
that...
i
would
have
thought,
apart
from
entertaining
your
position
that
it's
not
the
jones
act
claim,
and
the
choice
of
forum
that
congress
has
provided,
but
it's
only
the
device
of
jury
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
isn't
the
remedy
the
courthouse
that's
closest
to
my
home
that's
most
convenient
for
me?
why
isn't
that
the
remedy
that
is
saved,
the
ability
to
choose,
irremovably,
the
venue?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
position
was
that
that
wasn't
saved
at
all,
because
you
could
get
a
nonjury
trial
in
the
admiralty
forum.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
practically
what
the
position
you're
urging
on
us
comes
down
to
is
that
the
jones
act
plaintiff
can
get
his
choice
of
forum
as
long
as
he
insists
on
having
a
trial
by
jury.
if
he
doesn't
insist
on
having
a
trial
by
jury,
he
doesn't
preserve
his
right
to
choose
the
forum.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
your
position?
