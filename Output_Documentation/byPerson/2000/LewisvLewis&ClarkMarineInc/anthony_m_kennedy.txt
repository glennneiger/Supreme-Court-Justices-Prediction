anthony
m.
kennedy
how
does
it
work
in
practice?
you
have
a
single
claimant,
and
there's
adequate,
adequate
funds
to
cover
the
claim
and
it
goes
to
the
state
court.
then
6
weeks
later
somebody
else
has
a
slip
and
fall,
and
then
there's
another
suit.
does
that
make
everything
start
all
over
again?
how
does
this
work
in...
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
great
merit
to
your
position,
but
that
on
the
other
hand
there's
going
to
be
problems
down
the
line
when
you
have
subsequent
claims,
or
is
that
maybe
not
a
problem?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay,
so
the
priority
is
what
solves
the
problem,
then.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--a
chronology
of
when
the
claim
was
filed,
or
when
the
injury
occurred?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
i
think
there
might
be
a
problem
with
successive
claims.
we
need
not
get
into
it.
it's
in
the
background,
it
seems
to
me,
of
the
rule
we
must
make,
because
if
we
ship
it
all
off
to
the
state
court,
and
then
there
are
going
to
be
subsequent
claims,
you
might
have
to
start
the...
stop
the
state
proceeding
midway.
