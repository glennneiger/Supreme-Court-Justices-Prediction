mr.
james
v.
o'brien
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
issue
that
is
presented
on
certiorari
grant
from
this
court
in
this
case
is
whether
the
district
court
in
this
case
abused
its
discretion
in
lifting
the
injunction
that
was
imposed
upon
the
filing
of
the
limitation
of
liability
case
and
allowing
the
claimant
to
proceed
with
a
nonjury
case
in
illinois
state
court,
where
he
was
a
single
claimant
in
the
limitation
and
where
the
fund
was,
at
least
after
the
initial
filing,
deemed
adequate.
the
eighth
circuit
answered
this
question
in
the
affirmative,
and
held
that
since
the
remedy
sought
by
the
claimant,
a
nonjury
trial,
was
already
available
in
the
limitation
of
liability
court,
that
there
was
no
saved
remedy.
in
other
words,
there
was
no
statutory
right
of
the
claimant
implicated,
and
therefore
the
federal
district
court
in
the
limitation
case
was
bound
by
its
grant
of
jurisdiction
under
article
3,
section
2--
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
--mr.
chief
justice,
our
position
in
the
case,
and
i
believe
the
position
of
the
eighth
circuit
was
that
if
a
jury
trial
had
been
requested,
then
a
remedy
that
was
not
available
in
the
district
court
would
have
been
sought
and
therefore
a
saved
remedy
would
have
been
sought,
and
therefore
the
stay,
assuming
the
single
claimant
exception
and
the
adequate
fund
exceptions
were
met,
would
have
been
allowed
to
proceed
in
illinois
state
court.
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
to
a
large
extent
it
does.
if
i
may--
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
--our
position
takes
a
step
back,
and
our
position
looks
back
at
the
original
origin
of
the
single
claimant
exception
that
was
set
forth
by
this
court
in
langnes
v.
green,
and
what
we
say
is
that
we
know
a
number
of
things
about
what
this
court...
what
the
district
courts
have
to
do
under
the
limitation
of
liability
act.
unlike
some
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
petitioner,
where
there
is
no
limitation
case,
we
know
that
when
there's
a
limitation
case
on
file
there
is
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction,
and
we
know
that
the
district
courts
are
therefore
bound
to...
exclusively
to
administer
the
rights
of
the
limitation
claimant
and
all...
the
limitation
petitioner,
excuse
me,
and
all
those
claimants
who
make
claim.
the
only
way
for
any
given
claimant
to
exit
from
the
limitation
case
is
if
they
can,
for
lack
of
a
better
word,
trump
the
limitation
petitioner's
rights
to
an
exclusive
determination
in
the
federal
court
with
some
statutory
right,
and
in
this
case
that
would
be...
the
source
of
that
right
would
be
28
u.s.c.
section
1333,
the
saving
to
suitors
clause.
now--
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
--because
the
limitation
of
liability
act
has
more
than
just
to
limit
liability.
it
also
has
the
purpose
of
allowing
an
exoneration
to
be
pursued
by
the
shipowner
and,
indeed,
in
langnes
v.
green,
the
seminal
case
that
started
this
exception,
the
court
was
very
clear,
this
court
was
very
clear
that
the
limitation
court
had
both
the
power
to
decide
exoneration
and
limitation.
now--
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
--mr.
chief
justice,
we
believe
that
the
entire
act
construed
by
this
court
in
the
norwich
v.
wright
case
provides
that
right.
specifically,
section
183,
but
also
read
in
conjunction
with
section
185
and
the
entire
statute.
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
well,
the--
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
--yes,
your
honor.
well,
the
statute
itself,
of
course,
is
in
the
united
states
code,
and
under
section
183
of
title
46
the
vessel
owner
is
entitled
to
pursue
the
limitation
of
liability,
and
is--
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
--yes,
sir.
your
honor,
going
back
to
norwich
v.
wright,
this
court
on
at
least
a
dozen
occasions
since
1871
has
decided
that
exoneration
is
a
fundamental
right
under
the
statute
and
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
limitation
proceeding.
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
the
early
cases,
justice
ginsburg,
typically
involved
a
petitioner
limit
after
a
judgment
had
already
been
obtained
in
a
district
court.
indeed,
the
norwich
case
that
is
the
case
cited
in
both
briefs,
and
the
original
seminal
case
in
limitation
liability,
involved
such
a
proceeding,
and
the
benefactor,
the
second
case
after
norwich,
also
involved
a
shipowner
that
came
in
after
a
finding
of
liability
in
the
district
court.
but
when
those
early
decisions
came
out
construing
the
limitation
of
liability
act,
for
the
first
time...
it
had
been
passed
in
1851...
they
had
to
decide
what
it
meant,
and
there
is
an
extended
discussion
in
norwich
v.
wright
about
it,
and
in
that
case
this
court
stated
that
the
american
limitation
of
liability
act
represented
a
departure
from
english
law,
because
the
english
chancery
courts,
which
had
earlier
heard
limitation
cases
in
england,
lacked
the
power
to
investigate
claims
in
admiralty,
and
therefore
under
english
admiralty
law
the
shipowner
was
required
to
admit
liability.
in
the
american
courts,
and
under
the
limitation
act
as
construed
by
this
court
in
norwich
v.
wright,
a
determination
not
only
of
limitation
was
undertaken,
but
also
exoneration,
and
from
that
time
forward--
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
--not
per
se,
your
honor.
not
per
se.
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
it
is
not
found
in
the
statute,
although
it
does
state...
the
statute
does
state
that
the
vessel
owner's
liability
shall
not
exceed
the
value
of
the
vessel--
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
--well,
it
also
does
not
deny
the
district
court...
the
same
statute
that
gives
the
jurisdiction
to
decide
limitation
of
liability
does
not
deny
to
the
district
court
the
ability
to
decide
exoneration.
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
well,
certainly
that's
one
option.
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
and
i...
we
would
certainly
urge
that
on
the
court,
and
i
believe
it's
part
of
the
limitation
act
that
the
shipowner
should
be
entitled
to
seek
exoneration
in
any
case
in
which
it
seeks
a
limitation
as
well.
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
we
do
not.
it's
clear
that
the
rights
that
the
seaman
has
under
the
jones
act
are
subordinate
to...
in
general
to
the
rights
of
the
shipowner
to
limit
liability.
in
other
words--
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
--because...
for
the
reason
that
it's
clear
that
if
it
had
been
a
limitation
proceeding
with
multiple
claimants
in
a
case
where
the
claims
asserted
exceeded
the
value
of
the
vessel--
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
--well,
what...
langnes
really
rests
upon
three
distinct
factors.
langnes
says,
first
you
have
to
have
a
limitation
of
liability
case.
langnes
says
second,
you
have
to
have
a
single
claimant,
and
third
you
have
to
have
a
request
for
a
jury
trial.
those,
in
our
view,
are
the
three
pillars
upon
which
that
case
was
decided,
and--
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
--your
honor,
i
do,
and
the
reason
is
because
it's
the
request
for
a
jury
trial
that
implicates
a
saved
remedy.
the
request
for
a
jury
trial
is
what
implicates
a
right
under
the
saving
to
suitors
clause,
which
in
that
situation
exceeds
the
interest
of
the
vessel
owner
in
staying
in
federal
court.
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
yes.
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
justice
breyer,
i
think
it's
key
to
look
at
langnes
v.
green
and
see
in
that
case
that
this
court
stated
emphatically
that
the
procedure
under
the
limitation
of
liability
act
was
to
first
look
at
exoneration
and
then,
if
liability
was
found,
to
look
at
limitation
issues.
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
well,
let
me
state
that
initially...
the
initial
claim
filed
in
this
case
did
exceed
the
limitation
fund,
and
so
that
at
the
time
the
vessel
owner
instituted
the
proceeding,
that
was
certainly
in
play
and,
indeed,
when
the
initial
claim
was
filed--
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
--the
short
answer
is
that
we
know
in
this
jurisdiction,
where
the
state
court
suit
could
have
been
brought,
that
tripping
over
a
wire
could
lead
to
a
judgment
in
excess
of
the
value
of
the
vessel,
and
so
therefore
the--
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
--vessel
owner
had
a
good
faith
reason
for
pursuing
limitation.
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
no.
i
believe
the
vessel
owner,
based
on
its
experience,
and
based
on
its
knowledge
of
the
situation,
felt
that
an
accident
had
occurred
during
this
voyage
which
might
make
its
vindication
under
the
limitation
of
liability
act
a
realistic
legal
possibility,
and
so
a
petition
was
filed.
there's
no
rule
that
prevents
a
vessel
owner
from
coming
in
before
the
claims
are
filed,
just
as
there's
no
rule
that
prevents
a
vessel
owner
from
coming
in
while
claims
are
being
filed
or
after
they're
filed,
so
the
timing
of
the
filing
of
the
limitation
of
liability
proceeding
is
really--
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
--well,
knowing,
i
think,
and
having
a
good
faith
belief
that
the
proceeding
might
be
in
the
vessel
owner's
interest
are
too
different
things.
i
don't
think
there
was
any
way
to
predict
the
future
at
the
time
the
petition
was
filed,
but
certainly--
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
--that's
true,
because
we
shortly
thereafter
had
a
claim
in
excess
of
the
value
of
the
vessel.
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
yes.
by
stipulation,
i
think
in
the
joint
appendix
at
69
the
record
reflects
that
the
initial
claim
was
in
excess
of
the
value
of
the
vessel,
and
by
stipulation--
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
--well,
justice
stevens,
our
position
is
that
once
the
jurisdiction
of
the
limitation
code
is
validly
invoked,
which
it
was
in
this
case,
that
jurisdiction
attaches,
and
under
the
constitution
and
laws
the
district
court
is
obligated
to
decide
all
those
issues,
and
the
only
way
to
escape...
for
the
claimant
in
this
case
to
escape
that
jurisdiction
is
to
point
to
a
definite
statutory
right
that
allows
him
to
defeat
federal
jurisdiction.
now,
in
this
case
it
would
be--
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
--that's
true,
and...
but
we
know
a
number
of
things
about
the
saving
to
suitors
clause.
we
know
that
the
rights
under
it
are
not
absolute,
and
we
know
that
because,
number
1,
a
jones
act
claimant
can
have
his
case...
excuse
me.
a
limitation
claimant,
not
a
jones
act
claimant,
can
have
his
case
removed
to
federal
court.
we
know
that
the
saving
to
suitors
clause
doesn't
protect
the
right
of
a
bank,
say,
to
sue
a
lender
or
a
debtor
on
a
first
preferred
ship
mortgage.
we
know
those
kinds
of
cases
are
committed
to
the
federal
court
and
can't
be
brought
in
a
state
court.
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
well,
that
is
his
right,
to
sue
where
he
thinks
he
can
obtain
the
best
verdict,
unless
there's
some
kind
of
illegal
forum
shopping
going
on,
but
that
really
is
what
this
case
is
all
about.
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
the
vessel
owner
is
entitled
to
pursue
limitation
where
it
believes
the
purposes
of
the
act
will
be
furthered,
in
other
words,
where
it
sees
that
it
has
an
opportunity
to
invoke
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
the
rights
from
some
accident
occurring...
occurring
during
some
voyage.
and
if
i
may
address
a
point
from--
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
--unless
he
pursues
a
right,
the
claimant
pursues
a
right
that
is
preserved
under
the
saving
to
suitors
clause
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
well,
it's
really...
what
it
is
is...
let
me
refine
my
comment.
what
i'm
really
saying
is
that
if
the
remedy
is
already
available
in
the
federal
court,
and
what
the
eighth
circuit
decided
was
that
if
the
remedy's
already
available
in
the
federal
court
in
the
limitation
proceeding,
there
is
no
saved
remedy
to
pursue
elsewhere,
and
so
the...
i
think
the
issue
for
this
court
is
not
so
much
jury
versus
nonjury
in
the
abstract
sense.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
specific
remedy
requested
is
available
in
the
federal
court
where
exclusive
jurisdiction
is
found.
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
well,
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
rights
under
the
saving
to
suitors
clause
are
not
absolute,
and
they
never
have
been
by
this...
held
so
by
this
court
or
by
any
other
federal
court.
they're
always
going
to
be
subject--
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
--well,
i
don't
think
the
decision
whether
or
not
the
nonjury
trial
is
saved
or
not
is
necessary
to
this
court's
decision,
nor
was
it
addressed
specifically...
in
fact,
it
was
reserved
specifically
by
the
eighth
circuit.
you
don't
need
to
get
that
far,
and
the
reason
is
because
under
the
rubric
adopted
by
the
eighth
circuit,
if
the
remedy
sought
is
available
already
in
the
limitation
court,
the
claimant's
not
allowed
to
go
back,
and
it
was
already
available,
i.e.
a
nonjury
trial,
so
the
court
below
never
needed
to
address
whether
a
nonjury
trial
was
specifically
a
saved
remedy
or
not,
nor
does
this
court
need
to
decide
that
for--
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
--that's
correct.
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
that's
correct.
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
well,
the
federal
reason
that
prefers
the
federal--
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
--well,
justice
breyer,
i...
number
1...
my
first
response
is,
i
don't
believe
that's
our
case.
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
we
do
have
a
federal
reason
for
being
here.
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
and
the
second
response--
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
--well,
i
suppose
that
would
be
true,
except
that
congress
has
spoken
to
the
situation
when
they've
committed
limitation
of
liability
acts
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
well,
i
would
prefer
to
think
of
exoneration
not
as
the
tail,
perhaps
the
other
set
of
legs
of
the
same
dog.
i
think
that
the
right
to
exonerate
is
half
of
what
you
have
under
the
statute.
the
right
to
limit
is
the
other
half
of
what
you
have
under
the
statute,
and
one
can't
be
divorced
from
the
other.
you've
got--
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
--well,
my
response,
justice
scalia,
is
130
years
of
decisions
from
this
court
and
others,
at
least
a
half
dozen
cases
from
this
court
holding
that
in
a
proceeding
under
the
limitation
of
liability
act
itself
now
the
court
determines
exoneration
as
well
as
limitation.
it
would
be
almost
impossible
for
this
court
to
write
exoneration
out
unless
it
were
prepared
to
overrule
all
those
cases.
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
no.
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
no.
what
i'm
saying
is,
what
langnes
v.
green
tells
us,
and
what
lake...
which
is
the
single
claimant
exception
case,
and
what
lake
tankers
v.
henn
tells
us,
which
is
the
multiple
claimant
case,
or,
excuse
me,
the
adequate
fund
case,
what
those
cases
tell
us
is
that
when
the
claimant
seeks
a
jury
trial
that
it
has
been
deprived
of
him
in
the
limitation
court,
that
under
those
circumstances
there
is
enough
of
a...
there's
enough
rights
there
for
that
claimant
to
trump
the
shipowner's
right
to
be
in
federal
court,
and
they
will
then
allow
him
to
go
back
to
state
court
assuming
that
on
the
one
hand
there's
a
single
claimant,
or
on
the
other
hand
there's
an
adequate
fund.
but
you
can't
look
back
at
lake
tankers
v.
henn
or
at
langnes
v.
green
and
write
out
of
the
court's
decisions
the
references
to
a
jury
trial
being
requested
by
the
plaintiff.
that
is
what
in
my
view
was
the,
really
the
moving
force
in
those
decisions
that
allowed
those
plaintiffs
to
go
back.
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
justice
stevens,
i
don't
think
we'd
be
here
if
the
courts
had
routinely
held
that
you
got
a
right
to
a
forum.
they
haven't.
what
the
courts
have
held,
this
court
and
the
federal
courts,
and
what
the
commentators
have
talked
about
for
decades,
is
the
right
to
a
remedy,
and
the
right
to
a
remedy
does
not
necessarily
entitle
him
to
go
to
a
state
court.
it
entitles
him
to
a
remedy.
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
well,
the
remedy,
as
the
court
stated
in
shilendez
v.
luckenbach,
the
remedy
is
the
means
employed
to
seek
the
redress
and
in
our
view,
and
i
think
the
cases
bear
this
out,
a
jury
trial
is
a
specific
form
of
remedy,
a
nonjury
trial
is
another
form
of
remedy.
it's
the
means
employed,
and
i
think
that
there's
really
no
question
under
the
case
law
that
a
jury
trial
is
in
a
class
separate
from
a
nonjury
trial
as
far
as
the
saving
to
suitors
clause
goes.
they're
different
remedies.
now,
they
both
seek
judgments,
but
in
a
different
way.
if
i
may
briefly
address
the
rule
(f)
argument,
the
position
urged
by
petitioner
that
rule
(f)
should
be
declared
invalid
is
in
our
view
extreme
and
not
warranted
by
the
case
law.
this
court
in
the
henderson
case
did
not
announce
a
general
test
for
the
determination
of
when
a
rules
enabling
act
rule
would
be
ultra
vires.
it
instead
decided
that
rule
4
trumped
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
provision
requiring
forthwith
service
of
process
on
the
basis
that
the
rule
was
purely
procedural.
but
if
i
may,
under
rule
(f),
three
of
the
four
items
that
petitioner
urges
are
contained
in
rule
(f)
and
that
mandate
that
it's
a
substantive
rule
are
found
in
the
limitations
statute
itself,
namely,
who
may
sue,
when
they
may
sue,
and
the
object
of
the
suit
and
so
therefore,
even
under
the
test
that
petitioner
cites,
rule
(f)
clearly
does
not
meet
the
standard
of
a
substantive
rule
that
would
be
struck
down
under
the
rules
enabling
act.
indeed,
the
limitation
act
addresses
those
items.
and
i
turn
again
back
to
the
original
decisions
by
this
court
in
the
benefactor,
in
the
norwich
v.
wright
case,
in
which
this
court
had
occasion
to
construe
the
act
and,
if
you
follow
the
language
closely
of
those
decisions
the
court
was
not
construing
rules
that
it
promulgated.
the
court
was
construing
rules
that
it
promulgated.
the
court
was
construing
the
act
itself,
and
the
original
admiralty
rules
that
were
promulgated
by
this
court
in
the
norwich
case,
the
original
50-some
admiralty
rules
from
1871,
were
rules,
but
they
were
in
themselves
interpretations
of
the
act
as
seen
by
this
court,
and
they
included
the
right
to
exoneration.
now,
if
the
limitation
petitioner
can
come
into
court,
and
if
he
can
pursue
a
limit...
exoneration
as
well
as
limitation,
then
by
definition
the
court
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
both
of
those
subject
matters
and
the
limitation
claimant,
in
this
case
the
jones
act
seaman,
can
return
to
state
court
only
if
he
demonstrates
that
the
remedy
he
wants
is
not
available
in
the
federal
court.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
james
v.
o'brien
--thank
you,
your
honor.
