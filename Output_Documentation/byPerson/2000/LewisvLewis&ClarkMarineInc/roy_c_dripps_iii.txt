mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
both
the
jones
act
and
the
limited
liability
act
can
and
should
be
given
effect
in
this
single
claimant
case,
yet
respondent
seeks
to
use
the
limited
liability
act
to
destroy
rights
conferred
by
congress
on
lewis
as
a
seaman.
the
jones
act
incorporates
the
provisions
of
the
federal
employers
liability
act
guaranteeing
the
employee
a
choice
of
a
state
or
federal
forum.
in
addition,
it
guarantees
him
the
freedom
from
removal
to
federal
court
in
the
event
he
chooses
a
state
court
forum.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
yes,
sir,
and
that
statutory
remedy
is
saved
to
lewis
by
the
saving
to
suitors
clause,
yet
it
can
only
be
preserved
in
this
case
by
dissolving
the
injunction
against
state
court
proceedings.
this
court's
decision
in
the
1931
langnes
case
held
that
the
injunction,
even
without
stipulations,
should
be
dissolved
to
allow
the
state
court
suit
to
proceed,
and
that
the
admiralty
court
would
resume
jurisdiction
only
in
the
event
that
the
state
court
judgment
exceeded
the
amount
of
the
limitation
fund.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
justice
o'connor,
it
would
be
only
in
a
multiple
claimant
excess
fund
situation,
and
even
then
under
the
jones
act
there
might
be
a
question
with
regard
to
preserving
multiple
suitors
claims
under
the
jones
act,
but
generally
in
a
non
jones
act
multiple
claimant
excess
fund
situation
the
vessel
owner
does
have
the
right
to
maintain
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
admiralty
court.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
not
necessarily.
i'm
saying
that
it's
a
question
that
potentially
could
be
raised,
but
it
hasn't
been.
that's,
of
course,
not
this
case.
this
is
a
single
claimant
case,
and
part
of
the
court's
discretion
at
the
district
court
level
certainly
was
finding
that
it
could
be
a
single
claimant
case,
which
the
district
court
order
did
note
in
footnote
3.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
oh,
absolutely
not,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
that
was
made
clear
in
the
langnes
case,
because
in
the
langnes
case
the
district
court
in
fact
exonerated
the
vessel
owner,
and
were
that...
were
rule
(f)
to
preclude
dissolution
of
the
injunction,
certainly
the
court
would
have
simply
relied
on
the
exoneration
finding.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
i
do.
however,
and
i
want
to
make
this
clear,
the
court
need
not
reach
that
issue
if
it
simply
follows
the
langnes
analysis.
the
rules
enabling
act
analysis
only
comes
into
play
in
this
case
if
the
respondent's
position
is
adopted,
in
that
they
say
that
we
have
no
right
to
go
to
state
court.
at
that
point,
i
am
forced
to
attack
the
rule
which
gives
them
the
right
to
have
a
liability
and
damage
determination
made
in
the
federal
court,
which
i
do
say
is
invalid
as
violation
of
the
rulemaking
powers
of
this
court.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
i
agree
completely
that
if
the
court
simply
follows
the
langnes
case
and
says
that
the
jones
act
allows
this
case
to
be
brought
in
state
court,
and
that
that
statutory
remedy
is
preserved
by
the
saving
to
suitors
clause,
and
that
the
injunction
should
be
dissolved
on
that
basis,
the
court
need
not
reach
the
issue
of
the
invalidity
of
rule
(f)
in
this
case.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
in
that
case
the
plain
language
of
the
limitation
statute
in
anything
other
than
fire
requires
the
vessel
owner
to
admit
liability
and
cannot
use
the
limitation
statute
as
a
method
to
shift
the
forum
and
then
contest
liability.
the
shipowner
has
a
choice
of
one
or
the
other
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
believe
that's
a
problem,
because
normally
when
you
have
a
case
like
this
you
have
separate
or
serial
funds.
each
time
the
vessel
owner
wishes
to
file
a
limitation
case
there's
a
separate
valuation
made,
and
it's
a
separate
proceeding.
now,
the
seaman's
claims
will
become
liens
in
priority
of
the
time
they
arise,
but
that's
a
separate
issue,
and
i--
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
--exactly.
there's
a
priority
based
on
chronology.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
i
believe
that
it
is
of
the
time
of
the
judgment,
except
for
wages,
when
it's
a...
wages
are
a
lien
that
accrue
as
of
the
time--
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
--well,
justice
kennedy,
i
believe
that
would
only
be
a
problem
if
the
vessel
owner
tenders
the
vessel
to
a
trustee
rather
than
posting
security
for
value,
which
is
what
was
done
in
this
case.
if,
in
fact,
the
vessel
is
turned
over
to
a
trustee,
though,
the
likelihood
is
that
it's
not
going
to
be
employed
by
the
owner,
and
so
that
owner
won't
be
allowed
to
have
a
subsequent
claim,
and
if
they
post
security
for
value,
i
think
that
solves
the
problem,
because
there
is
a
fund
posted,
and
we
won't
be
in
a
situation
where
we
have
competing
claims
for
the
same
fund.
in
other
words,
they
will
be
different
funds.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
there
is
no
dispute
concerning
that,
justice
ginsburg.
in
the
motion
to
dissolve
the
restraining
order,
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix
on
page
70,
and
i
believe
it's
at
page
71,
paragraph
6,
lewis
made
the
specific
claim
that
this
was
a
single
claimant
accident.
that
claim
has
never
been
rebutted
or
contradicted
by
the
opposing
side,
by
the
vessel
owner,
so
this
is
clearly
a
single
claimant
case.
now,
what
your
question
suggests
then,
is
why
was
this
case
filed,
and
it
was
filed
simply
as
a
forum
shifting
device.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
wouldn't
use
the
term
precipitously,
but
the
complaint
was
filed
on
march
24
of
1998.
normally,
in
the
case
of
a
mass
disaster,
for
example,
there
would
be
immediately
a
motion
for
an
injunction
and
a
notice
to
potential
claimants
that
goes
out.
that
was
not
done
in
this
case
until
may
11,
6
weeks
or
so
after
the
initial
complaint,
and
it
was
not
done
until
after
the
state
court
case
had
been
filed.
what
they
did
was,
they
filed
a
limitation
case
in
the
federal
court
and
then
sat
on
it,
waited
to
see
if
lewis
was
going
to
institute
suit
or
not.
when
he
did,
they
obtained
the
injunction
restraining
prosecution
of
the
suit,
and--
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
--it
was
filed
in
the
eastern
district
of
missouri,
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
missouri,
across
the
river
from
madison
county,
illinois.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
rather
than
filing
it
in
the
southern
district
of
illinois.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
and
i
think
the
linton
case
from
the
fifth
circuit
in
1992
addresses
that
point
specifically,
justice
ginsburg,
and
they
say
that
the
saving
clause
saves
a
nonjury
jones
act
case
because
that's
part
of
the
seaman's
remedy
under
the
jones
act.
the
jones
act's
election
language
says
the
seaman
has
the
right
to
maintain
an
action
at
law
or...
with
or
without
a
jury
and,
by
incorporating
the
federal
employees
liability
act,
he
can
do
it
in
state
or
federal
court.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
that's
true,
chief
justice.
the...
and
i
think
the
linton
case
goes
on
at
great
length
to
discuss
that,
and
the
significance
of
that
i
think
is
perhaps
made
more
clear
by
the
antiremoval
provision
in
28
u.s.c.
1445(a).
the
defendant
cannot
remove
that
case
to
federal
court
where
he
would
be
able
to
trigger
the
seventh
amendment
and
get
a
jury
trial.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
that
is
what
the
linton
case
said,
and
that
point
wasn't
specifically
brought
up
in
the
briefs,
although
i
believe
this
court
has
addressed
that
issue.
i'd
have
to
go
outside
the
briefs
to
give
you
a
case
cite.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
but
this
court
has
addressed
it.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
and
in
this
case
congress
has
specifically
said
that
the
injured
employee
has
the
option
of
determining
whether
or
not
it
should
be
a
jury
or
nonjury
trial.
that's
what
this
court
said
in
the
panama
railroad
case
v.
johnson,
from
1920.
the
linton
case
simply
followed
that,
and
said
that
the
fact
that
the
seaman
chooses
the
nonjury
remedy
in
state
court
does
not
transform
the
case
into
something
that
is
now
removable
because
it's
outside
the
scope
of
the
saving
to
suitors
clause.
and
that
ties
in
with
this
court's
decision
in
the
red
cross
lines
case,
where
it
concluded
that
statutory
remedies
are
saved
remedies,
and
in
this
case
mr.
lewis
is
a
seaman
invoking
his
rights
under
the
jones
act,
which
is
a
federal
statute.
accordingly,
that
remedy
is
saved
to
him
by
the
saving
to
suitors
clause,
and
congress'
decision
to
confer
the
right
to
select
the
forum
and
the
form
of
trial
on
the
seaman
is
also
saved
by
the
saving
to
suitors
clause.
in
contrast,
the
vessel
owner's
rights
in
this
case
have
been
fully
protected
by
lewis'
stipulations.
we've
guaranteed
their
right
to
seek
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
admiralty
court,
and
in
that
case
their
federal
statutory
rights
are
fully
protected,
but
by
precluding
us
from
being
able
to
preclude
in
state
court,
they
are
destroying
the
rights
that
congress
has
conferred
upon
us
in
the
jones
act
and
preserved
from
the
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
through
the
savings
clause.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
justice
ginsburg,
what
we've
done
is
guaranteed
that
their
limitation
action
will
be
successful.
they
have
limited
their
liability.
they've
capped
their
liability.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
absolutely,
although...
and
i
don't
think
that's
necessary,
though,
to
a
resolution
of
the
case.
if
we
look
back
at
the
langnes
case,
which
was
a
jones
act
case,
the
court's
decision
simply
hinged
on
applying
the
saving
to
suitors
clause
so
that
both
statutory
doctrines
could
be
implemented,
which
is
what
i'm
asking
this
court
to
do
now,
rather
than
to
pick
one
in
an
effort
to
destroy
the
other,
and
that
is
the
goal,
i
think,
of
this
case.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
justice
souter,
that's
right.
the...
in
the
event
that
a
state
court
judgment
would
be
entered
in
excess
of
the
limitation
fund
i
think
they
have
an
absolute
right
to
go
back
into
the
federal
court
and
say,
wait
a
minute,
lewis
agreed
that
in
order
to
get
to
state
court
his...
our
liability
would
be
capped,
and
at
that
point
the
federal
judge
would
have
the
right
to
enter
an
order
limiting
their
liability.
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
about
that.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
sure.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
but
they
don't
have
the
right
to
go
beyond
capping
their
liability,
which
is
what
they're
seeking
to
do.
they're
seeking
to
shift
the
forum
from
the
state
court,
which
has
been
guaranteed
to
us
by
congress,
into
the
federal
court
so
that
the
liability
and
damage
determination
can
be
made
there,
and
that's
what
we
say
is
improper.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
in
some
ways,
justice
ginsburg.
now,
if
i
understand
the
question
correctly,
i
don't
believe
that
the
exoneration
rule
is
an
incorporation
of
congress'
allowing
them
a
defense
under
the
jones
act.
i
think
that
defense
has
to
be
taken
in
the
context
of
the
statute,
and
they
can
choose
to
defend
and
require
us
to
put
on
our
proof
of
negligence,
but
only
in
the
context
of
the
forum
grant
that
is
given
to
the
employee
by
congress.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
that's
true,
that
is
the
essence
of
the
exoneration
claim,
and
that's
what
they
want
the
federal
court
to
decide.
the
two
responses
to
that
are,
first
of
all,
the
langnes
case
from
this
court
essentially
held
that
the
exoneration
claim
was
not
sufficient
to
preclude
dissolution
of
the
injunction
because,
as
i
noted
earlier,
in
langnes
the
district
court
had,
in
fact,
exonerated
the
vessel
owner.
this
court
nonetheless
required
the
injunction
to
be
dissolved
and
the
case
to
go
back
to
state
court.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
if
it
had
not
been
reversed
by
this
court
it
would
have
been
preclusive.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
but
this
court
said
that
determination
has
to
be
made
in
state
court
and
not
in
federal
court.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
the
determination
of
liability
and
damage,
and
once
it's
made
in
state
court,
it
is
preclusive
of
the
exoneration
claim
in
federal
court
under
the
rule
of
the
benefactor,
which
this
court
decided
in
1880.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
yes,
it
would,
but
the
court
reversed
it
because
the
determination
should
have
been
made
by
the
state
court
in
the
first
instance
rather
than
the
federal
court,
and
that's
the
essence
of
the
langnes
holding,
that
we're
implementing
the
jones
act's
grant
to
the
seamen,
preserved
through
the
saving
to
suitors
clause,
of
the
right
to
proceed
in
state
court,
rather
than
be
forced
into
federal
court
by
the
shipowner,
and
that
holding
was
made
without
the
presence
of
any
stipulations
regarding
res
judicata,
and
this
court
said
that
the
case
will
go
back
to
state
court
for
that
determination.
the
other--
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
--that's
absolutely
true,
justice
ginsburg.
they
have
the
right
in
state
court
to
defend,
require
the
plaintiff
to
prove
negligence,
causation,
and
damage.
they
will
be
getting
in
the
state
court
the
benefit
of
that
defense
that
they
seek
to
assert
in
federal
court.
they
are
not
being
deprived
of
any
rights
by
proceeding
in
state
court,
and
their
federal
right
of
limitation
will
be
guaranteed
to
them
by
the
stipulations
that
we
filed
waiving
res
judicata
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
limited
liability
and
stipulating
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
to
decide
the
limitation
issues.
those
protect
their
federal
rights,
and
their
right
to
defend
and
require
proof
of
negligence
and
the
other
elements
of
the
plaintiff's
case
are
all
things
they
can
assert
in
the
state
court.
the
other
reason
that
the
exoneration
rule
should
not
be
permitted
to
control
disposition
of
this
case
and
we're
required
to
be
brought
into
federal
court
is
because
at
that
point
we
do
get
into
the
rules
enabling
analysis
and
i
simply
wanted
to
mention
the
henderson
case
that
this
court
decided
in
1996,
which
set
forth
four
factors
that
the
court
considers
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
provision
is
substantive
or
procedural.
rule
(f)
meets
each
and
every
one
of
those.
the
henderson
court
indicated
that
the
factors
are,
who
may
sue,
which
is
answered
by
rule
(f)(1),
which
says
any
vessel
owner,
on
what
claims,
the
amount
of
all
demands
in
conflict,
tort
or
otherwise,
rule
(f)(2),
for
what
relief,
exoneration,
or
limitation
from
liability
under
rule
(f)(2),
and
within
what
limitations

not
later
than
6
months
after
receipt
of
a
written
notice
of--
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,

--for
being
substantive.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
i
say
that
if
the
court
adopts
the
analysis
that
the
respondent
has
offered,
then
we
need
to
grapple
with
the
rules
enabling
act
analysis,
and
in
that
case
the
provision
of
conferring
a
substantive
right
to
sue
by
rule
violates
the
rules
enabling
act
because
it
conflicts
with
the
congressional
statutory
scheme
of
the
jones
act
by
abridging
or
modifying
lewis'
right
to
sue
in
state
court
and
enlarges
the
vessel
owner's
right
to
seek
limited
liability
in
federal
court.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
well,
normally,
justice
ginsburg,
i
would
agree
with
you
that
that
is
what
the
rules
do.
in
this
particular
case,
however,
this
court's
decision
in
the
benefactor
specifically
said
that
the
fifty
sixth
rule
in
admiralty,
which
was
the
predecessor
of
current
rule
(f),
was
designed
to
circumvent
the
prevailing
english
rule
requiring
the
vessel
owner
to
admit
liability.
so
in
fact
the
rule
has
done
the
opposite
of
what
you
suggest.
it
has
created
a
substantive
right
to
sue
for
a
determination
of
liability
and
damage,
where
in
fact
the
common
law,
or
the
prevailing
admiralty
law,
required
the
opposite,
that
the
vessel
owner
admit
liability,
and
that
was
the
decision
specifically
of
this
court.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
o'brien
indicated
that
three
of
the
four
items
that
are
in
rule
(f)
are
in
the
statute.
what
he
neglected
to
mention
is,
as
what
justice
scalia
asked
earlier,
the
one
that's
not
in
the
statute
is
the
one
that's
critical
to
his
analysis,
which
is
the
exoneration
provision,
and
that's
not
in
the
statute.
mr.
o'brien
relies
heavily
on
the
benefactor,
and
i
would
simply
refer
the
court
to
the
quote
from
the
benefactor.
it's
at
103
u.s.
241.
it's
at
page
16
of
the
reply
brief,
and
the
court
said
that
hence,
this
court,
in
preparing
the
rules
of
procedure
for
a
limitation
of
liability,
deemed
it
proper
to
allow
a
party
seeking
such
limitation
to
contest
any
liability
whatever.
that
is
not
the
statement
of
statutory
construction.
that
is
a
statement
of
legislative
intent.
we're
adopting
these
rules
so
that
the
party
can
contest
the
liability.
now,
that
is
exactly
what
is
forbidden
by
the
rules
enabling
act,
yet
that
is
what
this
court
said
it
was
doing
in
1880.
justice
stevens
and
justice
breyer
both
asked
about,
in
essence,
whether
there
would
be
a
right
to
a
pure
exoneration
claim
in
federal
court,
and
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
both
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
fect
v.
murkowski
case
and
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
joyce
v.
joyce
case
have
said
no,
that
unless
there
is
a
viable
claim
for
limitation
you
cannot
come
in
and
ask
for
exoneration,
and
i
think
that
is
the
rule
that
this
court
should
adopt.
the
langnes
decision,
as
justice
stevens
noted--
mr.
roy
c.
dripps,
iii
--as
justice
stevens
noted
does
not
require
a
jury
trial,
but
it
simply
said
that
a
jury
trial
is
one
aspect
that
makes
the
state
court
forum
desirable,
and
that's
part
of
the
jones
act
remedy
to
allow
the
injured
employee
that
option
of
choosing
either
state
or
federal
court,
and
whether
or
not
to
have
a
jury
trial
in
either
forum.
to
get
to
the
respondent's
not
otherwise
available
test,
this
court
is
going
to
have
to
say
that
the
saving
clause
does
not
protect
statutory
remedies,
particularly
the
statutory
remedy
afforded
by
the
jones
act,
which
allows
the
employee
to
choose
the
forum
that
the
case
will
be
tried
in.
that,
however,
is
exactly
what
the
saving
clause
was
designed
to
do,
and
that
is
why
this
court
should
reverse
the
eighth
circuit's
decision
and
reinstate
the
decision
of
the
district
court
dissolving
the
injunction.
