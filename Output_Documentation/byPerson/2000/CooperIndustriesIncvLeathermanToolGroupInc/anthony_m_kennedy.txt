justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
the
reprehensibility
of
the
conduct,
do
you
envisage
that
if
you
prevail
the
circuit
court
will
have
some
sort
of
standards
for
reprehensibility,
or
how
will
it
go
about
writing
this?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
could
see
if
it
was
abuse
of
discretion,
i
can
hear
the
circuit
court
saying,
well,
trial
judges
see
the
witness,
and
they
heard
the
whole
trial,
and
they're
in
the
position
to
make
this
judgment,
and
we're
not
going
to
second
guess
them.
that's
what
would
happen
under
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard
in
all
likelihood.
what
would
the
circuit
court
do
with
this
first
prong
that
justice
o'connor
mentioned,
reprehensibility?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
argue,
mr.
reynolds,
different
principles
to...
and
different
propositions
to
the
circuit
court
than
you
would
to
the
jury,
or
do
you
just
argue
the
same
thing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
that
the
court
of
appeals--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--does
consider
different
propositions,
i.e.,
comparative
awards
and
similar
cases
in
other
parts
of
the
country,
or
something
like
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
if
that's
true,
then
justice
scalia's
proposition
that
no
reasonable
juror
could
find
the
award
doesn't
quite
work,
because
you're
putting
forth
different
contentions
to
the
two
different
bodies.
you're
putting
one
case
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
another
to
the
jury,
i.e.--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
this
is
inconsistent
with
what
other
juries
and
judges
have
done
around
the
country
and
therefore
just
doesn't
meet
the
standard
of
proportionality
under
some
nation
wide
proportionality
standard
that
the
jury
didn't
hear
about,
or
is
the
answer
that
the
jury
can
hear
about
this
stuff?
