chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
99-2035,
cooper
industries,
inc.
v.
leatherman
tool
group.
mr.
reynolds.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
have
much
doubt,
mr.
reynolds,
that
if
the
standard
is
de
novo
review,
there
will
be
more
determinations
of
lower...
of
the
district
court,
trial
court
upset
than
if
there's
abuse
of
discretion
review?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
more
law
would
develop
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
presumably.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
reynolds.
mr.
massey,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
the
ornelas
case
from
our
court
is
against
your
position
to
a
certain
extent.
you
say
that
the
bmw
standards
are
very
fact
specific.
ornelas
involved
a
fourth
amendment
question,
which
is
classically
fact
specific--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
yet
we
held
there
that
the
review
was
de
novo
and
not
abuse
of
discretion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
bmw
v.
gore
announces
a
constitutional
rule,
presumably
there's
a
need
for
national
standards
there,
just
as
surely
as
with
the
fourth
amendment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
though,
you
could
have
said
the
same
thing
about
ornelas.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
a
part
of
de
novo
review.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
cite
ornelas
just
because
i
wrote
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
court
of
appeals
apply
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
when
it's
reviewing
the
decision
of
a
trial
court
under
rule
59?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
does
one
of
our
cases
stand
for
that
proposition?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
we
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--because
we
thought
it
was
an
open
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
that's
quite
different
than
the
habeas
rule.
i
mean,
there's
no
writ
of
habeas
pecuniae
that
says,
you
know,
if
you
lose
a
punitive
damages
award
in
the
state
court
you
can
go
into
federal
court
and
relitigate
it.
that's
just
the
ordinary
pressure
that
any
trial
judge
is
subject
to
knowing
he
will
be
reviewed
by
an
appellate
judge,
appellate
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
they
have
nothing
to
fear.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
massey.
mr.
reynolds,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
reynolds.
the
case
is
submitted.
