justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
reynolds,
let
me
ask
you
if
i
am
understanding
your
argument
correctly
in
this
respect.
i
think
you're
making
two
different
kinds
of
arguments
for
the
value
of
the
de
novo
review.
the
first
argument
is
simply
that
de
novo
review
on
its
own
merits
is
the
better
review
here.
the
second
argument
is
sort
of
a
practical
one,
that
if
all
you
have
is
abuse
of
discretion
review
of
what
the
trial
judge
does
when
the
trial
judge
reviews
the
jury
verdict,
you're
not
going
to
have
very
many
appellate
cases,
and
you're
certainly
not
going
to
have
many
appellate
cases
with
exhaustive
discussions
of
the
way
jury
verdicts
ought
to
be
examined.
and
i
think
you're
saying
that
if
you
have
de
novo
review,
you're
simply
going
to
have
more
articulations
by
appellate
courts
of
the
way
trial
courts
ought
to
look
at
jury
verdicts,
and
if
you
are
making
the
second
argument,
i
suppose
you're
making...
you're
saying
what
ought
to
happen
in
the
development
of
the
review
of
punitive
damages
is
the
same
thing
that
i
think
happened
back
in
the
old
days
on
the
review
of
jury
verdicts
of
negligence.
if
you
go
back
in
the
law
reports
to
the
twenties
and
the
thirties
when
negligence
law
was
developing,
you
find
exhaustive
appellate
discussions
of
whether,
you
know,
the
train
was
close
enough
to
the
intersection
for
the
driver
to
have
been
negligent
in
going
out
on
the
track,
and
so
on,
and
i
think
you're
arguing
for
a
sort
of
parallel
between
punitive
damages
development
and
maybe
the
old
negligence
law
development,
in
that
you're
saying
each
one
would
profit
greatly
by
having
plenary
treatment
in
appellate
courts.
is
that
a
fair--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
agree.
i
agree.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
value
is
not
only
in
the
substantive
standard,
the
value
is
in
the
application
of
that
standard
in
sort
of
developed
appellate
discussions.
justice
david
h.
souter
are
these
studies
of
what
trial
judges
have
done
in
reviewing,
or
are
they
studies
about
what
appellate
courts
have
done
in
reviewing
trial
judges?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
it's
thorough
appellate
review...
you
say
it's
not
a
toothless
standard,
but
i
mean,
his
argument
is
that
his
teeth
are
very
far
apart,
and
a
lot
is
going
to
get
through,
and
sure,
there
are
some
teeth,
but...
i
mean,
i...
it
seems
to
me
that
your
brother's
argument
is...
does
not
depend,
perhaps,
on
exact
parsing
of
the
difference
between
applying
de
novo
and
abuse
so
much
as
it
does
in
emphasizing
that
if
you're
going
to
have
de
novo
review
it's
going
to
be
a
more
aggressive
review,
and
it's
going
to
be
a
more
articulate
review,
and
doesn't
he
make
sensible
points
in
that
respect?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
i
mean,
you've
just
been
telling
us
that
they're
going
to
review
carefully
on
abuse
of
discretion,
and
i
suppose
they're
going
to
have
to
look
at
long,
burdensome
records
there,
aren't
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
difference
between
the
rule
59
situation
a
sort
of
precedent
for
what
we
should
do
here,
in
the
situation
we've
got
here,
something
like
this--
rule
59
motions
are
reviewing,
sort
of,
or
are
intended
to
review
what
are
claimed
to
be
specific
mistakes
and
problems
in
individual
cases,
but
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
regarded
somehow
as
a
more
serious
and
a
more
intractable
problem
than
what
rule
59
addresses,
and
therefore
the
argument
is,
because
you
have
a
more
intractable
problem
in
trying
to
get
some
kind
of
coherent
standard
for
punitive
damages,
you've
simply
got
to
have
a
more
restrictive
remedy
or
a
more
intensive
review,
so
rule
59
really
is
not
a
good
precedent
to
appeal
to.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
the
sort
of
normal...
i
say
normal
remittitur
motions,
but
i
don't
think
we
perceive
the
problem
of
remittitur
issues
as
being
a
problem
comparable
to
the
difficulty
of
trying
to
get
some
kind
of
a
coherent
standard
for
punitive
damages,
and
because
the
problems
are
different
maybe
the
remedies
and
terms
of
judicial
review
ought
to
be
different.
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--when
you're
finished,
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
question
of
historical
tradition,
but
go
ahead
and
finish
what--
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
massey,
going
back
to
the
historical
point
that
you
alluded
to,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
follow
your
argument,
and
i'd
like
you
to
maybe
expand
on
it.
i
realize...
i
mean,
we
have
faced
the
argument
that
historically
the
review
of
a
jury
verdict
is
very,
for
this
kind
of
punitive
excessiveness
is
very
grudging,
but
we
passed
that
point
and
we
said,
yes,
there
can
be
some
review,
and
that
review
to
begin
with
can
take
place
by
a
trial
judge,
and
a
trial
judge
who
is
performing
what,
i
think,
functionally
is
an
abuse
of
discretion
review
of
what
the
jury
did,
informed
by
particular
gore
factors
and
so
on,
can
set
it
aside.
once
we
have
passed
the
point
of
saying
there
can
be
that
kind
of
review
by
the
trial
judge,
what
is
it
historically
that
would
have
a
bearing
on
the
question,
whether
the
appellate
court's
review
of
the
trial
judge
is
either
de
novo
or
abuse
of
discretion?
i
would
have
thought
that
the
force
of
historical
precedent
is
behind
us
once
we
take
the
position
that
the
verdicts
can
be
reviewed
at
all?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
might
ground
an
argument
saying
the
trial
judge's
review
is
itself
unreviewable,
but
that's
not
your
argument,
and
if
we
accept
the
proposition
that
the
trial
judge
can
be
reviewed
under
some
standard,
what
historically...
what
does
history
tell
us
as
to
whether
that
standard
ought
to
be
de
novo,
in
which
case
the
appellate
court
is
looking
at
the
jury
verdict
for
abuse,
or
on
an
abuse
of
discretion,
in
which
case
the
appellate
court
is
looking
for
an
abuse
by
the
trial
judge,
who
reviews
for
abuse?
what
does
history
tell
us
when
we
are
at
the
stage
where
we
are
at
now?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
review
of
the
jury...
the
substantive
standard
for
reviewing
the
jury
verdict
is
going
to
be
exactly
the
same
in
either
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
if
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
if
that
is
not
a
reason
for
saying
there
is
no
appellate
review,
i
don't
know
why
it
is
a
reason
for
making
this
choice
between
two
varieties
of
appellate
review.
