justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
you
want
is
not...
i
mean,
i
can't...
i'm
having
trouble
seeing
what
the
difference
is
between
the
standards.
like
a
lot
of
other
things,
the
answer
seems
to
be,
it
depends
on
what's
at
issue
in
the
particular
case.
this
is
a
federal
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they're
already
reviewing
for
abuse
of
discretion
under
rule
59
the
decision
not
to
give
a
new
trial
on
the
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
inevitably
you're
saying,
you
have
to
review
this
for
abuse
of
discretion
at
least
there,
and
now
we
get
into
the
constitutional
area,
so
it
must
be,
you
know,
sort
of
beyond
that,
and
there
are
certain
things,
reprehensibility
or
harm,
you'd
say,
look,
judge,
remember,
the
district
court
judge
saw
this
and
you
didn't,
and
take
that
into
account.
now,
when
you
get
into
the
comparison
of
other
penalties,
as
to
that,
i
don't
see
why
the
district
judge
would
be
in
a
superior
position
at
all.
the
judge
would
be
in
a
superior
position
to
decide
how
reprehensible
this
person's
behavior
was,
and
how
harmful
it
was
to
this
plaintiff,
but
then
once
we
get
the
outer
limits
of
that,
the
appellate
judge
on
his
own
applies
the
constitutional
standard
as
an
element
of
deference,
and
there's
a
big
element
of
no
deference.
i
mean,
what
can
you
say
beyond
that,
and
then
beyond
that,
the
words
de
novo
and
abuse
of
discretion
become
slogans.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
people
who
want
a
tough
review
say,
de
novo,
the
people
who
want
a
weak
review
say,
abuse
of
discretion,
but
those
are
slogans.
in
terms
of
how
the
judge
should
act,
is
it
as
i
described?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
all
right.
leaving
the
slogan
out
of
it,
how
do
you...
if
what
we
want
to
have
happen...
and
i'm
not
sure
there's
a
disagreement
between
the
two
sides
on
it.
i'll
find
out...
what
form
of
words
do
we
use
to
get
that
to
happen?
i
mean,
it's
like
be
a
judge.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
couldn't
find
any
except
the
ones...
i
just
had
to
look
this
up
for
another
reason,
and
justice
ginsburg
has
a
couple
in
an
opinion
she
wrote,
but
the
case...
i
mean,
this
seems
not
a
question
of
mixed
fact
and
law,
but
up
to
a
certain
point
you
decide
what
the
facts
are.
now,
once
the
facts
are
there,
it's
purely
a
question
of
applying
the
legal
label,
and
so
the
real
question
is,
under
what
circumstances
does
a
court
of
appeals
defer,
where
all
that's
happened
is
the
trial
judge
is
applying
the
legal
label
to
a
set
of
undisputed
facts.
now,
until
we
get
to
the
point
of
dispute,
i'll
give
you
all
the
discretion
you
want,
but
once
we're
in
the
nondisputed
area,
at
that
point,
the
only
two
i
could
find
were
the
ones
you
mentioned.
there
was
a
rule
11
case,
and
she
had
both,
and
there
was
question
involving
competence
of
witnesses
or
something,
competence...
there
was
a
competence
thing.
i
can
see
it
on
the
page.
you
know
what
i'm
talking
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
couldn't
find
any
other
than
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
strongly
legal...
it
isn't
a
question
of
degree.
it
is
a
question
of
black
and
white.
the
question
of
applying
a
legal
label
to
a
set
of
undisputed
facts
is
a
question
of
law.
now,
you
can
give
as
much
weight
as
you
want
to
the
judge
before
you
decide
what
the
nondisputed
area
is,
so
i'll
give
you
all
that.
now,
i
say,
defer,
defer,
defer,
as
long
as
there's
any
factual
matter
in
dispute.
at
that
point,
we
reach
the
area
where
there's
none.
now,
all
we're
doing
is
applying
the
legal
label.
now,
on
that
one,
is
there
anything
other
than
what
justice
ginsburg
had
in
her
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
but
then
that's
exactly
the
question,
because
i'd
say,
i
don't
see
any
reason
why,
once
we're
in
the
area
of
undisputed
fact,
why
there's
any
reason
that
a
court
of
appeals
here
should
defer
one
little
bit,
any
more
than
it
does
with
any
other
standard
of
law,
except
with
a
very
few
exceptions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
difference
with
59,
i
thought,
look,
bmw
is...
governs
quite
extreme
cases,
you
know,
and
if
you
say,
look,
judge,
you
have
a
lot
of
discretion
under
59,
and
you
have
a
lot
of
discretion
to
decide
how
egregious
something
is,
and
you
have
reprehensibility,
and
how
much
harm,
and
all
those
things.
now
you
give
him
discretion
on
discretion,
then
you
say
at
this
last
step,
where
you're
also
applying
this
legal
label
that
only
applies
to
extreme
cases,
you're
saying,
and
now
there's
some
more
discretion
even
in
that,
you
don't
have
much
of
a
rule
left.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
then,
you
have
to
take
the
facts
as
the
plaintiff
states
them.
i
mean,
normally,
these
trials,
you
take
the
facts
as
the
plaintiff
states
them,
then
the
defense
comes
along
on
appeal
and
says,
well,
you
can't
take
that,
because
there's
no
support
for
that,
but
you're
going
to
have
to
do
that
anyway
in
any
appeal,
and
so...
but
you
read
it
with
an
eye
favorably
towards
the
side
that
won,
you
know,
and
there's
always
an
argument
you
can't
read
it
that
favorably,
but
that's
going
to
be
true
no
matter
what
standard
you
have.
but
having
done
that,
i
don't
see
what's
left
that's
so
tough
for
the
appellate
judge
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
saying
that
that
kind
of
thing--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
true
in
every
trial,
every
appeal.
they're
always
arguing
about
that
sort
of
stuff,
and
that's
true
whether
punitive
damages
are
at
stake
or
not,
and
that's
true...
you
know,
i
mean,
you
get
an
appeal,
there
are
dozens
of
arguments
like
that
from
a
complicated
trial,
so
we
always
go
through
that.
i
know
how
to
do
it.
i
mean,
i
might
not
do
it
brilliantly,
but
i
try,
and
what
you
do
is,
you
read
it
with
an
eye
favorably
towards
the
side
that
won.
now,
that's
true
regardless.
now
i'm
looking
at
the
stage
beyond
that,
and
once
you're
beyond
that,
i
don't
see
that
it's
so
tough
for
a...
you
know,
it
isn't
too
complicated.
you
now
know
what
your
facts
are.
so
it's
at
that
point
that
i...
and
i
don't
know
how
to
write
it
to
get
this...
i
don't...
i
see
where...
you
see,
i
need...
i
don't
think
you
disagree
that
much
with
it,
but
i'm
not
sure.
