mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
we
urge
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
for
two
principal
reasons.
first,
there's
the
historical
tradition
under
which
punitive
damages
were
largely
committed
to
the
jury
with
quite
limited
appellate
review,
the
second
reason
is
the
pragmatic
argument
for
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
as
justice
o'connor
and
justice
kennedy
have
recognized,
the
gore
guideposts
are
intensely
fact
specific,
reprehensibility
perhaps
most
of
all
and,
as
this
court
noted
in
gore,
reprehensibility
is
perhaps
the
most
important
indicator
of
the
reasonableness
of
an
award.
also--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
we
believe
that
reasonableness
is
maybe
a
close
analogy,
because
the
touchstone
of
excessiveness
is,
of
course,
reasonableness,
and
it
is
the
sort
of
grossly
excessive
standard
that
justice
scalia
has
referred
to,
and
in
many
contexts
reasonableness--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
it's
done
both,
your
honor.
i
mean,
pullman
standard
against
swint
is
a
case
noting
the
difficulty
of
precise
categorizations,
but
in
the
context
of
reasonableness,
cooter
and
gell,
for
example,
the
reasonableness
of
rule
11,
the
pierce
v.
underwood,
the
reasonableness
of
a...
of
the
legal
position
taken
by
the
government
in
equal
access
to
justice
cases.
cooter
and
gell
is
notable
because
it
discussed
how
negligence
has
been
traditionally
reviewed
very
deferentially
under
an...
essentially
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
so
i
think
justice
souter's
concern
about
the
development
of
the
law
can
be
fully
addressed
through
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
and
that--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
well,
it's...
yes.
we
agree
that
the
very
last
step
of
the
analysis
has
a
strongly
legal
flavor
to
it,
but--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--there's
gasperini,
your
honor,
which
involved
a
new
york
statute
which
did
not
simply
direct
district
courts
to
review
the
historical
facts
underlying
a
compensatory
award,
but
instructed
them
to
engage
in
a
comparative
analysis,
an
essentially
legal
analysis
of
this
compensatory
award
versus
other
compensatory
awards
in
new
york
to
see
if
they
were
comparable.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
exactly,
your
honor,
and
that
was
essentially
a
legal
inquiry,
but
this
court
said
the
court
of
appeals
was
constrained--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
as
justice
scalia
noted,
the
question
of
whether
a
mistake
of
law
has
been
made
is
an
automatic
abuse
of
discretion,
if
there
hasn't
been
a
mistake,
so
traditionally
this
label
of
abuse
of
discretion
has
been
used,
even
though
before
gore,
even
under
state
law
excessiveness
standards,
there
was
always
the
last
step
of
applying
the
law
to
the
facts
in
the
court
of
appeals.
in
other
words,
consider
a
state
which
has
codified
standards
for
excessiveness
of
damages,
as
some
states
have,
like
texas,
for
example.
that...
the
district
judge
has
no
discretion
whether
to
apply
those
statutory
criteria.
he
has
no
limited
right
to
be
wrong,
in
judge
friendly's
terms.
that's
a
pure
issue
of
law
in
the
last
step,
yet
the
standard
of
review
has
always
been
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
yes,
your
honor,
you
did.
we
believe
that
case
is
not
controlling,
because
first
there
were
separate
interests
there,
a
need
for
a
national
standards
of
law
enforcement,
and
other
reasons
that
the
court
noted.
in
particular--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
your
honor,
we
think,
though,
that
a
district
court
review
would
be
the
best
way
to
promote
uniformity
in
the
context
of
punitive
damages,
because--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
this
court
did
note
in
ornelas
the
importance
of
deferring
to
local
courts
and
law
enforcement
officials
on
the
questions
underlying
the
judgments
of
reasonable
suspicion--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--yes,
your
honor.
you're
correct
about
ornelas.
that
doesn't
involve
the
jury
context
and
the
tradition
of
appellate
review
in
punitive
damages
cases,
but
you're
right
that...
of
course,
you
did
also
write,
though,
ohio
v.
robinette,
which
was
a
fourth
amendment
voluntariness
of
consent
to
search.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
no,
i
understand.
[laughter]
i
understand,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
understand,
but
the
robinette
case
is
a
case
where
you
noted
that
the
fact
specific
nature
of
reasonableness
made
bright
line
rules
inappropriate,
and
you
recognized
the
need
to
defer
to
the
sort
of
close
people
who
were
closer
on
the
facts
and
on
the
scene.
but
let
me
just
circle
back
for
a
moment,
because
the
rule
59
context,
and
motions
for
remittiturs,
those
have
always
been
judged
by
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
and
that,
of
course,
is
where
constitutional
excessiveness
challenges
are
ordinarily
raised.
there's
quite
a
logic
to
the
cooter
and
gell
position
that
we
ought
to
have
a
unitary
standard
of
review
in
this
area
because
the
rule
59
context,
as
justice
breyer
mentioned,
will
require
the
district
judge
to
apply
sometimes
the
very
same
standards
as
are
in
gore
to
the
judgment
under
state
law
requirements.
the
third...
the
second
and
third
gore
guideposts
have
been
tossed
out
as
being
primarily
legal,
but
that's
not
always
true.
the
second
guidepost
involves
actual
harm
as
well
as
potential
harm.
gore
noted
that
whether
a
high
ratio
is
permissible
because
of
a
particularly
egregious
act
might
have
resulted
only
in
a
small
number
of
damages.
in
other
words,
there
are
a
number
of
difficult
factual
questions
associated
with
each
of
these
guideposts.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
well,
your
honor,
if
we
think
that
you
will...
i
mean,
justice
souter's
concern
that
the
law
be
developed
in
this
area
we
think
can
be
fully
accommodated
by
abuse
of
discretion.
the
general
dynamics
amicus
brief,
and
the
brief
submitted
by
general
dellinger
in
this
case,
both
discuss
a
lot
of
studies
that
have
been
done
and
cases
that
have
been
decided
since
bmw
v.
gore.
one
striking
thing
is
the
role
of
courts
under
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
in
striking
down
punitive
damages.
there
are
about
six
studies
discussed,
the
gao
study,
rand,
michael--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--both,
your
honor.
both.
in...
the
total
of
both
trial
and
appellate
together
is...
the
range
of
reversal
goes
from
54
to
70
percent.
if
you
want
to
look
just
at
appellate
courts
applying
abuse
of
discretion,
i
believe
there
are
numerous
cases
in
the
general
dynamics
brief.
particularly,
there's
a
case
called
kim,
one
called
kimzey,
there's
an
aetna
life
case
from
the
ninth
circuit,
so
i
don't
believe...
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard
is
not
a
toothless
standard.
as
this
court
noted
in
u.s.
v.
taylor,
which
was
a
1980
speedy
trial
act
case
which
reversed
the
dismissal
of
a
case
under
the
speedy
trial
act,
this
court
described
abuse
of
discretion
as
permitting
thorough
appellate
review,
so
we
don't
share
the
view--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
perhaps
superficially,
but
i
really...
but
we
believe
that,
for
example,
the
practical
result
of
telling
courts
of
appeals
that
they
have
to
review
de
novo
long,
burdensome
records
might
be
actually
to
reduce
the
amount
of
time
they
have--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
we
believe
that
in
a
case
involving...
the
headline
cases
we
see
in
the
papers
about
big,
punitive
awards
can
be
addressed
fully
by
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
what's
going
to
happen
in
the
run
of
the
mill
cases,
where
the
result
is
actually
reasonable
and
falls
within
what
this
court
described
in
gore
as
the
zone
of
reasonableness,
those
cases
are
going
to
occupy
a
tremendous
amount
of
appellate
resources
without
many
differences
in
result,
and
the
result
of
the
whole
process
may
be
more
unpublished
opinions
in
punitive
damages
cases
because
the
courts
of
appeals
are
busy
reading
records
in
cases
where
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard
would
have
the
same
outcome.
so
we...
as
a
practical
matter,
rule
59
is
a
familiar
standard.
the
abuse
of
discretion
review
has
grown
up,
not
just
under
gore,
but
under
the
state
law
excessiveness
standards
which
courts
have
always
applied
historically,
even
though
the
last
step
of
applying
any
of
these
standards
could
be
described
as
a
purely
legal
issue.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
well,
sometimes
it
is,
your
honor.
sometimes
those...
i
mean,
the
second
guidepost
is
almost
always
part
of
the
jury
charge.
the
third
guidepost
is
a
part
of
the
jury
charge
in
some
places.
it
wasn't
in
this
case...
well,
there
is
an
oregon
statute
that
instructs
juries
on
the
criminal
and
legislative
sanctions
which
could
be
applied,
but
even
those
guideposts
will
be
very
factual.
for
example,
the
cooper
brief
in
this
very
case,
the
reply
brief,
leads
off
with
three
pages
of
factual
argument
about
potential
harm
and
reprehensibility
and
the
legislative
sanctions,
so
even
at
this
level
there's
still
factual
disagreement
about
how
to
apply
this.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
well,
your
honor,
in
resolving
the
parties'
disputes
about
what
reasonable
inferences
are
possible--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--i--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
i
don't...
i
agree...
i
don't
think
we
disagree
that
much.
we
think
an
abuse
of
discretion
label
for
the
analysis,
though,
is
more
appropriate,
because
that's...
in
all
the
cases
that
you've
reviewed
you've
mostly
been
applying
discretion
under
rule
59.
it's
not...
perhaps
in
many
cases
you
could
say
that
courts
of
appeals
are--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
i...
this
court's
cases...
yes.
it's
sort
of
accepted,
that's
the
accepted
standard
under
the...
as
in
the
tri
counties
case
that
you
heard
earlier,
that
was
the
thing
that
justice
breyer--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--yes,
your
honor.
no,
i'm
not
citing
that
case
as
precedent.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
right.
well,
that's
a--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
well,
your
honor,
procedurally
the
excessiveness
challenges
are
made
under
the
rule
59
rubric,
so
that
applying
the
sort
of--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
seriousness
with
which
the
lower
courts
address
this
problem
is
not
really
going
to
be
affected
by
the
standard
of
review.
i
think
the
message
has
been
sent
in
gore
and
has
been
received,
and
the
courts
have
shown
themselves
quite
willing
to
step
in
and
reverse
verdicts
that
the
perceive
to
be
excessive,
and
i...
we
believe
that
the
de
novo
standard
is
frankly
just
confusing.
it's
beyond
what
the
historical
tradition
would
permit.
it--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--sort
of...
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
well,
and
it
fails
to
recognize
the
first
hand
vantage
point
of
the
district
judge.
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
habeas
context,
for
example,
professor
baktor's
warning
that
it's
sort
of
debilitating
to
state
courts
to
be
told
that
they're
going
to
be
second
guessed
by
federal
courts.
in
this
instance,
when
you
have
highly
fact
intensive
questions
i
think
the
message
sent
by
a
de
novo
review
is...
might
have
the
unintended
consequence
of
sort
of
undermining
the
district
court's
willingness
to
grapple
with
the
record,
knowing
that
whatever
he
does
is
going
to
be
reviewed
again
by
the...
by
his
brethren
on
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
yes,
your
honor.
we...
i
simply
meant
that
the
judges
now
are
doing
a
very
conscientious
job
of
restraining--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
your
honor,
the
common
law,
though,
drew
the
line
between
the
trial
judge
and
the
appeals
court,
that
that...
the
seventh
amendment
was
adopted
largely
to
prevent
appellate
courts
from
interfering,
not
trial
judges.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
well,
i
mean,
history
would
counsel
that
having
gone
to
abuse
of
discretion
in
gasperini
we
ought
not
go
further
to
de
novo,
because
the
gasperini
step--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
but
that
was
always
true
historically.
in
other
words,
even
in
the
19th
century,
judges,
the
trial
judges
were
reviewed
for
excessiveness
but
not
courts
of
appeals
and,
even
before
gore,
we
had
common
law
standards
for
reviewing
damages
awards,
or--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--borrowed
those--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--well,
sort
of
in
for
a
penny,
in
for
a
pound,
but
we
think
we
ought
to--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--stop
where
we
are,
rather
than...
i
mean,
the
court
in
gasperini
made
the
quite
deliberate
decision
not
to
go
to
de
novo
review,
or
to
tell
the
courts
of
appeals--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
yes,
your
honor,
we
agree,
and
we
think
the
line
between--
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
--yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
s.
massey
well,
it
is
in
that
way,
although
of
course
the
gore
factors
themselves
are
distilled
from
the
common
law.
i
mean,
your
honor
did
not
mint
them
from
new
sources.
you
traced
back
to
the
common
law
roots,
and
footnote
24
of
gore
in
fact
refers
to
their
deep
rooted
nature
within
the
common
law.
so
we
think
the
common
law
precedents
are
still
highly
instructive.
but
going
back
to
the
line
between
compensatories
and
punitives.
i
mean,
at
common
law
there
was
not
that
line.
the
courts
did
not
treat
the
two
differently
and,
in
fact,
in
footnote
7
of
cooper's
reply
brief
they
discuss
the
common
law
tradition
of
treating
them
similarly,
indistinguishably,
in
fact,
in
the
same
verdicts,
so
we
agree
that
gasperini
here
is
controlling,
and
we
don't
think
it
should
be
overruled
or
modified,
and
we
don't
think
a
meaningful
distinction
can
be
drawn
between
punitive
damages
and
compensatories.
i
would
just
like
to
add,
and
this
uniformity
notion
that
we've
heard
about,
first
we
believe
the
district
courts
are
in
a
good
position,
but
also,
second,
this
court
in
txo
essentially
rejected
a
proposal
for
intrajurisdictional
comparisons.
the
bmw
factors
are
guideposts,
but
only
guideposts.
they
are
nonexclusive,
and
the
question
of
gross
excessiveness
lends
itself
to
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
rather
than
the
de
novo
one.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
