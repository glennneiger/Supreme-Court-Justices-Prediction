justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
reynolds?
you
indicated
that
you
thought
the
court
of
appeals
would
decide
what
the
appropriate
award
was.
i'm
not
sure
that's
right.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
of
appeals
decides
what
is
the
limit
on
appropriate
awards,
and
anything
over
whatever
the
ceiling
is
would
be
inappropriate.
is
it
your
view
that
if
there
is
a
reversal
or
remand
in
the
case,
that
the
instruction
should
always
be
to
enter
judgment
for
the
amount
that
would
be
the
maximum
constitutionally
permissible
award,
or
would
it
be
to
send
it
back
and
say
to
the
lower
court,
you
got
the
range
wrong,
instead
of
being
1
million
to
10
million,
it's
500,000
to
2
million,
and
you
can
start
over
again
and
put
the
new
award
within
the
permissible
constitutional
range?
which
way...
what
are
you
suggesting?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you
this
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
not
at
least
conceptually...
maybe
practically
it
doesn't
matter...
a
difference
between
constitutional
excessiveness
of
a
damage
award
and
nonconstitutional
excessiveness?
in
other
words,
could
not...
like
the
damages
in
gasperini
or
the
damages
here
might
be
excessive
in
a
sense
that
they
violated
state
law,
or
they
just
offended
the
conscience
some
way,
but
did
not
violate
the
constitution.
does
it...
is
there...
is
it
conceivable
that
an
award
could
be
excessive
as
a
matter
of
just
general
common
law
rulings
of
one
kind
or
another,
but
yet
not
violate
the
constitution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
this
case
is
conceptually
quite
different
from
gasperini?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
99-2035,
cooper
industries
against
leatherman
tool
group.
the
respondent
leatherman
tool
group
is
the
country’s
leading
manufacturer
of
multifunction
pocket
tools.
in
1995
petitioner
cooper
industries
decided
to
introduce
its
own
competing
product.
in
some
of
its
early
marketing
materials
instead
of
creating
its
own
prototype,
petitioner
simply
used
photographs
of
a
modified
leatherman
tool.
leatherman
sued
respondent
alleging
false
advertising,
unfair
competition,
and
violations
of
the
federal
trademark
statute.
leatherman
prevailed
and
the
jury
awarded
leatherman
$50000.00
in
compensatory
damages
and
$4.5
million
in
punitive
damages.
petitioner
challenged
the
punitive
damages
award
arguing
that
it
was
grossly
excessive
and
therefore
violates
the
due
process
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.
the
district
court
upheld
the
verdict
and
the
court
of
appeals,
reviewing
the
district
court’s
determination
for
an
abusive
discretion
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
to
decide
whether
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
correct
standard
of
review.
petitioner
argues
that
de
novo
review
is
appropriate
while
respondent
argues
in
the
favor
of
review
for
abusive
discretion.
for
reasons
stated
in
opinion
filed
with
clerk,
we
hold
that
de
novo
review
is
the
proper
standard.
compensatory
damages
and
punitive
damages
served
distinct
purposes.
the
former
measure
of
the
concrete
loss
that
the
plaintiff
suffered
by
reason
of
the
defendant’s
wrongful
conduct
whereas
the
latter,
are
intended
to
punish
the
defendant
and
to
deter
future
wrongdoing.
they
have
been
appropriately
described
as
“quasi-criminal”
and
as
“private
fines”.
because
punitive
damages
do
not
constitute
findings
of
fact,
the
seventh
amendment
does
not
present
a
bar
to
de
novo
review.
although,
states
possess
broad
discretion
with
respect
the
imposition
of
criminal
penalties
and
punitive
damages.
the
due
process
clause
imposes
substantive
limits
on
that
discretion.
in
the
context
of
both
criminal
penalties
and
punitive
damages,
this
court
has
enforced
these
limits
by
prohibiting
grossly
excessive
punishments.
we
have
determined
the
boundaries
of
this
gross
excessiveness
by
focusing
on
the
same
general
criteria,
like
degree
of
reprehensibility
of
the
defendant’s
conduct.
the
relationship
between
the
penalty
imposed
and
the
harm
to
the
victim
and
the
sanctions
imposed
for
a
comparable
misconduct
in
other
cases.
when
enforcing
these
limits
this
court
has
consistently
engaged
in
an
independent
examination
of
the
relevant
criteria.
the
same
de
novo
review
that
is
applied
in
criminal
cases
is
appropriate
in
the
punitive
damages
context.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
disenting
opinion.
