mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court--
the
court
today
considers
what
is
the
proper
standard
of
review
for
appellate
courts
when
faced
with
a
constitutional
challenge
to
a
punitive
damage
award
as
grossly
excessive.
in
the
instant
case,
the
ninth
circuit
upheld
a
punitive
damage
award
against
cooper
industries
of
4.5
million,
which
90
times
the
$50,000
compensatory
award.
it
did
so
using
an
abuse
of
discretion
review
standard.
we
submit
that
that
was
error,
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
examined
the
constitutional
excessiveness
issue
independently
under
a
de
novo
review
standard.
this
court
framed
the
gross
excessiveness
constitutional
inquiry
as
it
applies
to
punitive
damages
in
bmw
v.
gore.
it
identified
there
three
guideposts
for
making
what
is
essentially
a
comparative
analysis,
looking
at
the
reprehensibility
of
the
offense,
the
ratio,
or
relationship
of
the
punitive
damages
to
the
compensatory
award,
in
order
to
discern
whether
the
punishment
or
any
discernible
relationship
to
the
offense
or
was
wildly
disproportional,
and
as
a
third
guidepost
to
look
at
other
available
sanctions,
whether
criminal
or
civil,
that
would
bear
on
the
question
of
how
society
generally
punishes
this
sort
of
offense.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
you
certainly
could
come
to
the
same
conclusion
under
both
standards,
but
the--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
don't
know
that
you
would,
and
i
think
that
the
reason
de
novo
review
is
important
is
that
you
have
a
legal
issue
here.
you
have
one
that
implicates
a
constitutional
right.
it
is,
i
think
admittedly,
bottomed
on
guideposts
that
are
fluid
concepts,
and
there's
a
need
to
have
some
kind
of
a
coherent
doctrine
that
develops
so
as
to
have
a
uniform
application
of
the
substantive
standards.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
believe
there
probably
would
be
more
awards
that
would
be
upset,
or
there
would
be
more
remittitur
decisions.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that's
exactly
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make,
that
i
do
think
that
you
would
get
a
more
coherent
body
of
law.
you
would
be
able
to
better
determine
how
to
apply
the
standard,
and
it
would
be
applied
in
a
way
that
would
be
more
uniform,
and
i
think
one
of
the
objectives
of
the
due
process
protection
is
that
people
who
are
similarly
situated
be
treated
the
same
way
for--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--justice
o'connor,
i
think
that
it
could
be
characterized
as
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law
in
that,
as
i
understand
what
that
means,
it
means
that
if
you
have
established
facts,
and
you're
applying
a
legal
principle
to
those
facts,
that
would
be
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
to
some--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
to
some
extent
i
think
i
would
agree
with
you.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
what
we're
talking
about
here
in
de
novo
review
is
the
same
thing
that
the
court
does
traditionally.
as
to
historical
facts,
the
court
accords
deferential
review,
and
we
don't
suggest
there
would
be
any
difference
as
to
that.
but
when
you
get
to
the
legal
issue
of
where
you
cross
the
constitutional
line,
and
you
start
looking
at
it
in
a
comparative
analysis,
which
really
is
looking
at
extrinsic
facts
that
are
outside
the
record,
that's
where
the
legal
inquiry
comes
in
and
de
novo
review
would
be
required.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--as
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
would
basically
take
the
conduct
and,
on
the
established
record,
that
would
be
the
baseline,
if
you
will,
for
its
comparative
analysis
under
the
gore
factors.
you
would
have
to
look
at
where
that
conduct
fits
on
a
continuum
of
blameworthiness,
if
you
will,
and
that
would
be
essentially
a
legal
question.
what
you're
doing
is
very
much,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
what
you
do
under
the
de
novo
review
standard
that
this
court
announced
in
bajakajian,
i
believe
is
how
you
pronounce
it.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor,
here
the...
we
are
over
a
threshold
of
malice
that
is
necessary
in
order
to
award
a
punitive
award.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
right,
but
i
think
what
the
court
has
said
in
bmw
v.
gore
is
that
you
are
going
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
punishment
that
is
imposed
here
is
reasonably
related
to
the
crime,
and
whether
it
rationally
serves
the
interest
of
punishment
and
deterrence,
and
that
is
an
analysis,
a
legal
analysis
that
looks
to
this
conduct
as
compared
to
similar
conduct
and
the
way
in
which
that
has
been
treated
in
the
punishment
arena,
and
in
other
situations.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
that
would--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
don't
quarrel
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
your
honor,
i--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
think
that
there
is
a
substantive
standard
that
has
been
announced
as
being
applicable
in
bmw
v.
gore,
and
we're
not
going
back
and
suggesting
we
revisit
that.
what
we're
saying
is
that
it
ought
to
get
meaningful
application,
it
ought
to
be
applied
so
as
to
allow
the
courts
to
give
some
content
to
it
and
through
cases
to
come
to
a
more
clear
understanding
of
exactly
how
it
applies
in
different
cases.
it
is,
i
believe,
clear,
and
i
agree
with
the
chief
justice,
that
the
de
novo
standard
would
allow
courts
of
appeals,
who
believe
that
this
was
disproportionate
punishment,
it
would
allow
them
to
apply
a
remittitur
when,
under
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
they
would
feel
that
they
were
not
compelled
to.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
disagree--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
don't
disagree
that
where
you
have
a
punitive
award
that
is
so
over
the
line
that
everybody
agrees
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional,
that
whichever
standard
you
apply
would
probably
give
you
the
same
result.
you're
going
to
have
a
lot
of
cases
where
you're
not
talking
about
something
that
is
so
over
the
line.
i
happen
to
believe
this
case
is
one
that
is
so
over
the
line,
and
the
point
is
that
you've
got
a
legal
question,
it's
got
a
constitutional
dimension,
you've
got
a
standard
that
is
not
one
that
is
dependent
upon
looking
at
the
historical
facts
and
second
guessing
them,
and
that,
i
believe,
dictates
that
you
look
for
de
novo
review
and
independent
review
by
the
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
as
though
they
were
jurors
in
making
the
policy
judgment
as
to
what
the
appropriate
punishment
is
in
order
to
fulfill
the
goals
of
deterrence
and
retribution.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
believe
it's
clear
that
you
could
have
a
court
overturn
a
verdict
if,
indeed,
it
was
a
verdict
that
was
outrageously
excessive,
or,
as
they
said
in
the
early
cases,
driven
by
juror
bias
or
passion,
and
was
not
proportional
to
the
offense,
and
i
believe
the
common
law,
as
well
as
the
early
american
law,
has
said
that
punitive
damages
would
certainly
be
reviewable
in
that
regard,
as
would
compensatory,
so
i
think--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--appellate
review
is
available.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
right.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
understand--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--but
i
believe
in
gasperini
you
said
that
there
was
appellate
review.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
the...
well,
the
arguments
to
the
jury
in
this
regard
would
depend
in
large
part
on
the
instructions
that
were
given
to
the
jury,
and
i
think
there
are
some
instructions
that
would
be
very
problematic
to
give
the
jury
in
terms
of
the
bmw
v.
gore
guideposts,
so--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
don't
think
the
jury
would
have
the
same--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
think
that's
right.
i
think
that
the...
what
happens
is,
this
is
a
check
on
the
excesses
of
the
jury
determination
with
regard
to
punishment,
and
it
is
a
test,
as
i
understand
bmw
v.
gore,
that
says
that
we're
going
to
look
at
what
the
jury
did
in
this
case
in
order
to
serve
society's
interest
in
punishment
and
deterrence,
and
to
see
whether
that
is
out
of
line,
constitutionally
out
of
line,
with
the
punishment
that
is
visited
for
similarly
situated
people
who
commit
similar
offenses.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
is
a
check,
if
you
will,
at
the
appellate
level
on
the
jury
judgment
call.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
think
that
certainly
there
are
special
instructions
that
could
help
to
inform
the
jury's
decision
that
we
would
not
be
at
all
adverse
to
giving.
i
understood
justice
scalia's
question
to
be
where
the
court
of
appeals
was
looking
to
see
whether
the
punitive
award
was
reasonable
amount
and
rational
in
terms
of
the
purposes
that
it
was
intended
to
serve,
and
i
think--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--that's
correct,
and
i
think
that
as
we
were
saying,
justice
ginsburg,
the
court
of
appeals
would,
in
that
instance,
do
the
traditional
deferential
review
of
the
historical
facts,
or
the
fact
questions,
but
as
to
this
legal
question
it
would
be
a
de
novo
review.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
fair,
justice
breyer.
i
do
think
that.
i
think
that
the
two
arguments
go
hand
in
hand.
in
other
words,
i--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--my
argument
that
the
de
novo
review
is
in
and
of
itself--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
think
that's
right,
especially
in
light
of
the
recent
decision
in
bmw
v.
gore.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
know
you're
not
going
to
like
this
answer,
because
i
think
that
what
i
would
say
is,
the
court
of
appeals
probably
could
take
either
approach.
if
the
court
of
appeals
viewed
the
award
as
constitutionally
excessive,
there
is
authority
that
suggests
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
set
what
would
be
the
maximum
allowable
award
constitutionally,
on
its
own.
i
think
there
is
also
the
ability
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
do
a
remand,
and
to
have
the
district
court
perform
that,
so
i'm
not
sure
that--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
have
a
specific
response
one
way
or
the
other
on
that.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--well,
i...
as
i
said
to
justice
stevens,
i'm
not
sure
i
can
say
it's
settled,
so
i
think
that
my
sense
is
that
they
could
do
either
one.
the
eleventh
circuit
has
in
the
johannes
case
ordered
the
remittitur
at
the
maximum
allowable
rate
constitutionally,
or
amount
constitutionally.
the
tenth
circuit
in
oxy
products
on
the
other
hand
did
not
do
that,
and
said
it
had
to
be
something
that
was
sent
back,
so--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--no.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the
seventh
amendment
reexamination
clause
would
not
inhibit
a
court
of
appeals
from
directing
the
maximum
amount,
and
i
say
that
because
we're
in
an
area
where
we
aren't
concerned
with
facts
tried
to
the
jury.
we're
in
an
area
where
we
have
a
legal
question,
where
the
jury
has
made
a
public
policy
judgment
call
on
the
punishment,
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
saying
is
that
the...
that
a
jury
could
not
have
imposed
a
punishment
in
excess
of
whatever
that
amount
is,
not
constitutionally.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
think
that
you
would
have
the
same--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
would--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
believe
the
kind
of
opinion
you're
likely
to
get
is
what
we
got
in
this
case,
where
the
ninth
circuit
simply
says
they
do
not
believe
that
the
district
court
abused
discretion,
and
it
would
not
provide
any
enlightenment,
or
any
kind
of
coherent...
doctrinal
coherence
to
the
bmw
v.
gore
factors
in
an
application
of
that.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
this
is
a
federal
case.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that's
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
think
as
the
judge
would
act
it
is
as
you
describe,
but
i
do
think
it
certainly
does
make
a
difference
what
standard
you
are
imposing.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well--
[laughter]
--that
would
certainly
be
a
good
beginning.
i
think
that
what
you
would
be
looking
at
is
the
kind
of
standard
that
you
imposed,
that
was
imposed
in
the,
i
go
back
to
the
bajakajian...
i
cannot
pronounce
that...
bajakajian
case,
where
the
court
had
the
excessiveness
issue
in
the
context
of
a
fine
and
the
eighth
amendment
and
said
de
novo
review
was
the
appropriate
review
to
determine
disproportionality,
and
went
through
a
not
dissimilar
kind
of
an
inquiry
that
bmw
v.
gore
laid
out.
and
i
believe
that
the
de
novo
standard
would
require
the
kind
of
demanding
or
exacting
review
of
those
guideposts
in
a
way
that
would
be
much
more
rigid
and
decipherable,
if
you
will,
and
understandable,
than
if
you
had
just
an
abuse
of
discretion
review
and,
because
it's
a
due
process
right,
and
it's
bottomed
on
the
interest
of
people
being
treated
who
are
similarly
situated
in
uniform...
uniformly
in
a
similarly
situated
way,
there
is
much
to
recommend
that
you
go
to
the
de
novo
standard
that
will,
over
time,
i
think,
help
to
develop
a
much
more
articulate
and
coherent
line
of
inquiry
for
applying
the
gore
standards.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
when
the
trial
court
makes
an
error
of
law,
that
it
would
certainly
be
an
abuse
of
discretion,
but
i
also
would
say
that
i
think
the
standard
we
use
here
is
one
that
is
compelled
by
the
nature
of
the
inquiry
and
the
fact
that
it's
constitutional,
and
by
the
gore
guideposts,
and
the
comparative
analysis
which
are
extrinsic
to
the
historical
fact
record,
and
that's
what
requires
that
there
be
a
de
novo
review.
i'll
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
on
gasperini,
i'd
just
like
to
say
there's
no
need
to
overrule
gasperini.
in
that
case,
the
court
was
looking
at
an
excessiveness
issue
as
it
relates
to
compensatory
damages,
not
to
punitive,
where
it
was
very
much
tied
up
with
a
review
of
the
historical
facts,
and
that's
why
the
court
said
that
deferential
review
was
what
was
required
in
gasperini.
here
we
have
punitive
damages
that,
as
i've
explained,
are
of
a
much
different
sort,
and
they're
not
tied
up
with
the
historical
facts,
so
gasperini
does
not,
certainly,
need
to
be
overruled.
the
other
point
i
make
under
rule
59--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--but
again
it
goes
to
the
compensation
in
the
compensatory
award.
we're
looking
now
at
the
punishment
on
the
defendant--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--the
calculation,
i
would
submit,
mr.
justice
scalia,
is
on
the
side
of
the
fact
finding,
the
historical
facts,
and
what
the
harm
is
to
the
injured
party.
here,
we
are
talking
about
not
facts
tried
to
the
jury,
the
historical
facts,
but
the
judgment
made
on
the
punishment
side.
i
do
think
that
there
is
a
difference
between
nonconstitutional
excessiveness
and
constitutional
excessiveness.
this
court
in
brown
and
ferris
did
say
that
where
you're
dealing
with
an
issue
of
nonconstitutional
excessiveness
on
the
punitive
damage
side,
that
the
deferential
review
would
be
the
appropriate
review,
but
unless
what
the
court
has
said
in
bmw
v.
gore
is
superfluous,
unless
we're
going
to
say
that
there's
no
difference
between
the
constitutional
excessiveness
and
nonconstitutional,
then
there
is
something
here
that
requires
a
de
novo
review
standard
that
is
not
just
the
deferential
review
that
you
have
in
the
nonconstitutional
context,
and
we
would
submit
that
the...
all
the
indicia
that
point
to
de
novo
review
are
in
place
here.
and
i
would
point
the
court
to
the
salve
regina
decision
of
this
court
which
does,
indeed,
explain
why,
when
a
de
novo
review
is,
is
indeed
required
and
necessary
on
a
legal
issue,
especially
of
constitutional
importance,
that
abuse
of
discretion
is
no
answer
to
that
review
standard.
thank
you.
