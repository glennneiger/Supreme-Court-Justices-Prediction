mr.
reynolds,
when
you
have
a
standard,
what
should
i
say,
so
wildly
extreme,
as
wildly
disproportionate,
does
it
make
any
difference...
does
it
really...
do
you
really
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
you're
reviewing
the
lower
court
for
a...
de
novo,
or
for
abuse
of
discretion?
i
mean,
the
question
is
whether
the
court
abused
its
discretion
in
not
considering
this
wildly
disproportionate.
does
that
really
boil
down
to
any
difference
for...
between
whether
it
is
wildly
disproportionate...
i
just
find
it
hard
to
imagine
a
situation
in
which
i
would
be
reviewing
a
district
judge
for
abuse
of
discretion,
and
would
find
that
it
is...
that
it
is
an
abuse
of
discretion,
where
i
wouldn't
also
find
that
it
was
wildly
disproportionate.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
point
is,
wouldn't
you
almost...
wouldn't
you
virtually
always
come
to
the
same
conclusion
under
both
standards?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
you
describe
the
precise
test
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
applying
under
your
standard
as
compared
with
the
precise
test
that
would
apply
under
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard?
it
seems
to
me
the
substantive
question,
which
they
would
apply
on
de
novo,
is
whether
any
reasonable
person
could
possibly
consider
this
proportionate.
isn't
that
the
test?
it
has
to
be
wildly
disproportionate.
i
assume
that
means
no
reasonable
person
could
consider
it
proportionate,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
if
you're
using
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
you
would
be
asking
whether
any
reasonable
judge,
whether
no
reasonable
judge
could
think
that
any
reasonable
person
would
consider
this
proportionate.
you're
sure
that
the
two
questions
don't
boil
down
to
the
same
thing?
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
it's
just
too
subtle
for
me
to
understand
the
difference
between
the
two.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
whenever
a
court
of
appeals
finds
that
no
reasonable
person
could
possibly
consider
this
proportionate,
so
it
is
wildly
disproportionate,
it
would
automatically
find
that
no
reasonable
judge
could
have
thought
that
a
reasonable
person
would
find
this
proportionate.
i
don't
know
whether
you
can
find
one
finding--
justice
antonin
scalia
--without
automatically
making
the
other
one,
so
what
are
we
arguing
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
reynolds,
this
problem
exists
no
matter
how
we
come
out
in
this
case,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
relevance
does
this
have
to
this
case?
i
mean,
this
is
going
to
be
a
problem
whether
the
review
is
de
novo,
or
whether
the
review
is
for
abuse
of
discretion,
and
we...
it
seems
to
me
we
shouldn't
find
for
or
against
you
on
the
basis
of
how
we
feel
on
this
point,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
whatever
standard
you're
going
to
use,
if
you
decide
that
the
district
court
got
it
wrong,
you're
going
to
be
confronted
with
this
issue--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
it
seems
to
me
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
we're
wrestling
with,
but
what
i
would
like
to
know
is
why
you
think
that
a
court
of
appeals
would
not
be
developing
law
if
it's
only
applying
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
doesn't
it
have
to
come
out
with
a
written
opinion--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
the
written
opinion
would
say,
you
know,
no
reasonable
judge
could
consider
that
this
was
not
wildly
disproportionate?
it
would
make
a
lot
of
law,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
it
always
an
abuse
of
discretion
when
the
trial
court
makes
an
error
of
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
--except
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
doesn't
pain
and
suffering
come
into
a
gasperini
calculation
sometimes,
or
often?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
it's...
i
understand.
i'm
not
sure
the
calculation
of
pain
and
suffering
is
much
different
from
calculation,
the
calculation
at
issue
here.
