mr.
reynolds,
is
this
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law
that
we're
talking
about?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
for
instance,
in
the
first
prong,
the
reprehensible
conduct,
presumably
a
review
of
the
facts
is
included
in
the
appellate
review,
so
you
do
seem
to
have
a
mixed
standard--

--mixed
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
do
we
do
generally,
if
you
look
at
our
precedents,
on
mixed
questions
of
fact
and
law
on
appellate
review?
you
see
some
statements
that
it's
de
novo
review.
what's
the
closest
analogy,
do
you
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
there
is
more
than
one
question
under
the
gore
standard,
in
addition
to
reprehensibility,
the
ratio
between
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
awarded,
and
how
the
award
compares
to
other
sanctions
available
for
comparable
misconduct.
those
latter
two
seem
closer
to
pure
questions
of
law,
in
a
sense.
what
has
this
court
historically
done,
do
you
think,
on
appellate
review
standard
for
mixed
questions
of
fact
and
law?
