justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
reynolds,
may
i
interrupt
you
at
that
point,
because
what
you
described
sounded
very
much
to
me
like
what
a
jury
does
when
it's
choosing
among
negligence
degrees
of
culpability,
negligence,
gross
negligence,
recklessness.
those
are
quintessentially
jury
decisions,
and
they're
not
reviewed
de
novo
by
any
judge,
not
the
trial
judge,
not
the
court
of
appeals,
so
why
isn't
the
degree
of
reprehensibility
exactly
the
same?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
like
you
would
be
over
a
threshold
if
you
decide
there's
negligence.
then,
if
there's
negligence,
then
there
would
be
recovery,
but
there
might
be
greater
recovery
if
you
had
a
higher
standard.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
whatever
word
you
use
to
describe
it,
i
take
it
that
what
you're
essentially
asking
is
to
have
the
judge,
as
a
panel
of
three
judges,
sit
as
though
they
were
jurors,
as
though
they
were
jurors
making
a
determination
of
reprehensibility.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
if
we
go
back
in
history,
punitive
damages,
i
believe,
was
considered
in
the
bailiwick
of
the
jury,
and
not
the
judge.
in
fact,
there
was
a
question
whether
any
judge,
even
the
trial
judge,
could
overturn
the
jury's
verdict,
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
reynolds--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i'm
not
certain
of
that,
and
i
think
that,
at
least
as
to
compensatory
damages,
there
was
some
disagreement
on
this
court
whether
there
was
any
allowance
of--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--appellate
review
at
all.
justice
scalia
and
i
differed
on
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--on
that
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
reynolds,
you're
looking
over
one
important
player.
it's
not
jury
versus
court
of
appeals
making
this
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
get
into
the
picture
until
a
district
judge,
the
trial
judge,
so
it
would
be
de
novo
review
not
of
the
jury's
assessment,
but
of
the
trial
judge's
refusal
to
tamper
with
the
jury's
verdict,
so
isn't
it...
the
court
of
appeals
is
reviewing
not
the
jury's
action
but
the
trial
court's
action,
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
reynolds,
is
it
settled--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
it
settled
that
a
court
of
appeals
could
order
a
remittitur?
i
didn't
know
that
that
was
a
settled
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
was
an
open
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we...
this
court
has
never
ruled
on
that
question--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
it's
in
the
background.
that
question
comes
up
in
the
background
of
the
seventh
amendment
in
the
reexamination
clause,
doesn't
it,
whether
the
court
of
appeals
can--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--can
instruct
the
entry
of
a
final
judgment
that's
different
from
the
number
that
the
jury
came
in?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
fact,
they
gave
that
instruction
to
the
appellate
courts,
and
this
court
said,
because
of
the
seventh
amendment,
that
job...
the
only
judge
positioned
to
do
it
in
the
federal
courts
would
be
the
district
courts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's...
mr.
massey,
the
point
that
i'm
having
difficulty
with,
and
i
think
justice
o'connor
raised
it
first,
there's
one
of
these
standards,
reprehensibility,
degree
of
reprehensibility
that
sounds
like
even
at
the
last
step.
it's
a
judgment
call
that
the
jury
makes,
just
as
i
described
gross
negligence
and
recklessness.
i
don't
really
see
the
difference.
but
the
other
two
standards,
the
seriousness
of
the
injury
and
the
comparable
awards
in
other
cases,
that
the
jury
isn't
so
well
equipped
to
deal
with,
and
you
can
say
this
is
law
applied
to
historic
facts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
gasperini?
gasperini
said
that
the
standard
for
the
appellate
court
vis
a
vis
the
trial
court--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--on
compensatory
damages
is
abuse
of
discretion,
and
that
was
a
majority
opinion--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--of
this
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
did
think
there
was
historical
precedent
for--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
and
there
was
disagreement
on
the
court
whether
that
was
so,
but
the
majority
held
that
there
was,
but...
so
unless
gasperini
is
overruled,
then
i
think
this
case
has
got
to
turn
on,
is
there
a
significant
difference
between
compensatory
damages,
where
we
said
abuse
of
discretion
is
it,
no
de
novo
review--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
punitive
damages.
it's
got
to
turn
on
that,
unless
the
court
is
going
to
redo
gasperini
and
say
no,
the
court
of
appeals
can
have
de
novo
review
there,
too.
