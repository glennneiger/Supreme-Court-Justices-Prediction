mr.
larson,
if
that's
the
position
you're
taking,
to
say,
if
we
read
cage
and
sullivan
and
we
see
this
is
a
watershed
rule,
practically
doesn't
it
become
less
watershed?
this
goes
back
to
a
question
justice
breyer
asked.
when
you
then
add
victor
and
sandoval,
and
you
get
to
the
proposition
that
the
jury
doesn't
have
to
be
given
any
charge
at
all,
it
can
be
left
to
its
own
devices
to
define
reasonable
doubt.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
incorrect,
mr.
larson.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
practically
isn't
there
a
great
risk
of
distortion
or
misunderstanding
if
there
is
no
charge
at
all?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they're
just
given
the
words,
and
i
thought
from
our
latest
decision
that
that
is
enough,
that
they
do
not
have
to
be
told
anything
more
than
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
the
standard.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
give
an
example
other
than
gideon?
i
mean,
you
say
this
is
not
a
watershed
rule.
gideon
is
a
watershed
rule.
and
then
there's
a
vast
space.
is
there
any...
is
gideon
it,
or
are
there
other
watershed
rules?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
think
we
would
like
to
know
if
you
have
a
positive
example,
not
what
isn't
a
watershed
rule,
but
what
is,
other
than
gideon?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
counsel,
based
on
your
argument
was
the
fifth
circuit
wrong
in
allowing
the
district
court
to
consider
this
successive
petition?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
am
asking
the
question
because
of
the
short
time
frame
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
to
determine
whether
it's
going
to
allow
a
successive
petition.
the
district
court
got
the
question,
as
it
did
here,
would
have
more
space.
but
you're
saying
that
the
court
of
appeals
within
the
short
time
that
it
has,
should
have
cut
this
off
at
the
pass?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
of
the
problems
with--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
is
it
appropriate
for
this
court
to
say,
now
we've
got
this
case
before
us,
and
we
decide
this
case.
there's
going
to
be
another
case
down
the
road
which
would
present
the
question
of
retroactivity.
so
we
are
going
to
say
in
this
case,
which
doesn't
present
the
question
because
it's
here
on
direct
review,
that
in
that
other
case
is
not
before
us.
courts
don't
operate
that
way.
they
decide
the
cases
before
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
gideon
example?
well,
that's
a
clear
case
where
it
would
be...
the
court
would
have
made
it
retroactive,
but
the
court
didn't
say
that
expressly
in
gideon.
