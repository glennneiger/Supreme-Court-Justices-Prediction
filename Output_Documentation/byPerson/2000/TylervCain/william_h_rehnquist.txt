we'll

argument

in

00-5961,
melvin
tyler
v.
burl
cain.
mr.
larson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
edpa?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
getting
back
to
edpa
for
a
moment,
mr.
larson.
that
says
that
an
applicant
has
to
show
the
claim
relies
on
a
new
rule
of
constitutionality
made
retroactive
to
cases
on
collateral
review
by
the
supreme
court.
now,
do
we
interpret
that
as
meaning
that
some
other
court
can
say
it
has
been
made
retroactive
by
our
court,
or
that
we
ourselves
must
have
said
it
is
retroactive?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when...
first
you
said
said,
and
then
must
have
done
something
to
communicate.
is
that
a
broader
standard
than
just
said?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
you
know,
one
obvious
choice
in
this
language
is
to
say,
yes,
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
this
rule
is
retroactive.
now,
does
your
use
of
the
term
made
mean
go
beyond
the
concept
of
a
holding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
you
define
made?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
this
court
need
not
have
said
so
in
haec
verba,
so
to
speak,
in
so
many
words.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
think
an
equally
simple
plain
meeting
is
to
say,
made
retroactive
would
be
that
this
court
has
said
they
were
retroactive.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
presumably
the
orleans
parish
bench
book
instructions
came
from
somewhere.
you
know,
i
think
reasonable
doubt
instructions
probably
were
quite
frequent
all
around...
they
had
to
be
in
any
criminal
case,
and
i
think
it
is
probably
not
terribly
accurate
to
assume
that
in
no
other
place
than
orleans
parish
was
this
sort
of
an
instruction
given.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
sullivan
that's
the
watershed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--if
per
curium
cage
is
just
following
winship,
isn't
it
a
little
hard
to
say
that
it's
the
new
rule.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
a
moment
ago
you
said
that
you
have
to
say
something
more
than
just
reasonable
doubt,
and
i
agree
with
you.
our
cases
have
not
said
that.
they
have
not
said
that
you
must
define
reasonable
doubt
in
any
way.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
saying,
quote,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
closed
quote.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
well,
i
wasn't
suggesting
it
was
on
the
defendant.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
larson.
mr.
heuer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
congress
was
not
particularly
sympathetic
to
second
habeas
petitioners
in
edpa.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
heuer.
mr.
feldman,
we
will
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
this
discussion
a
perfectly
good
reason
to
say,
we
should
analyze
it
the
way
it
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
not
do
anything
to
alter
that
situation
in
the
present
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
larson,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
long
a
term
was
your
client
serving?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
life
sentence?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
larson.
the
case
is
submitted.
