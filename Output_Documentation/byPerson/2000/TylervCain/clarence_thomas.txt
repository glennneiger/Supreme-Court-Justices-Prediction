justice
clarence
thomas
i
have
the
opinion
in
tyler
versus
cain,
no.
00-5961.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
petitioner
tyler
was
convicted
of
second
degree
murder
for
killing
his
20-day-old
daughter.
after
he
unsuccessfully
flawed
federal
habeas
relief,
this
court
decided
cage
v.
louisiana.
under
cage,
a
jury
instruction
in
unconstitutional,
if
there
is
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
understood
the
instruction
to
allow
conviction
without
proof
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
claiming
that
jury
instruction
at
his
trial,
was
virtually
identical
to
the
one
invalidated
in
cage.
tyler
sought
and
received
permission
to
file
a
second
habeas
petition.
the
district
court
addressed
the
merits
of
tyler’s
claim
and
denied
relief.
on
appeal
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed,
it
stated
however,
that
the
district
court
erred
by
failing
first
to
determine
whether
tyler
satisfied
certain
requirements
in
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act
of
1996
that
are
applicable
to
second
habeas
petitions.
this
act
requires
a
district
court
to
dismiss
the
claim
in
a
second
petition
unless
as
relevant
here,
the
applicant
shows
that
the
claim
relies
on
a
new
rule
of
constitutional
law,
made
retroactive
to
cases
on
collateral
review
by
the
supreme
court.
the
fifth
circuit
concluded
that
tyler
did
not
meet
the
standard
because
the
supreme
court
never
made
the
cage
rule
retroactive
to
cases
on
collateral
review.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm.
a
new
rule
is
not
made
retroactive
by
this
court,
unless
we
hold
it
to
be
retroactive.
although
the
word
“made”
might
be
ambiguous
out
of
context,
its
meaning
is
clear
in
the
context
of
the
statute,
because
“made”
means
held,
it
follows
that
this
court
has
not
made
the
rule
in
cage
retroactive
to
cases
on
collateral
review.
cage
itself
held
only
that
the
particular
jury
instruction
at
issue
was
unconstitutional,
and
although
we
determined
in
sullivan
v.
louisiana
that
a
cage
error
is
structural
error.
that
holding
is
not
equivalent
to
a
holding
that
cage
is
retroactive.
we
have
never
held
that
all
structural
error
rules
are
retroactive.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justices
stevens,
souter,
and
ginsburg
join.
