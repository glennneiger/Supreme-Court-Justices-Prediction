what
makes
cage
a
watershed
rule...
but
your
position
is
that
cage
is
a
watershed
rule.
justice

scalia
do
you
know
of
any
other
watershed
rule
that
we
have
announced
in
a
per
curiam,
unargued
opinion?
justice
antonin

but
it
is
the
language
of
the
court
in
sullivan.

so
sullivan's
the
watershed
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
would
think
all
of
those
are
not
watershed
rules.
i
mean,
surely
all
of
that
has
been
around.
i
don't...
i
really
don't
understand--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
makes
it
a
watershed
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
--unless
you
believe
that
what
we
say
has
effect.
i
don't
know,
some
people
believe
that.

be
able
to
get
the
benefit
of
the

is
what
you're
saying,
and
what
you're
saying
is,
serve
him
right,
he
should
have
raised
it
in
his
first
habeas.

saying
that
that's
one
of
the
results
of
edpa.
