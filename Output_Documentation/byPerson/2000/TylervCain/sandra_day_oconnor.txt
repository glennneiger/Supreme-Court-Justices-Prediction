justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
many
jury
instructions
do
you
suppose
have
been
given
out
there
in
the
past
on
reasonable
doubt
that
would
fall
within
cage?
i
would
think
there
might
be
a
great
many
and
going
back
a
great
many
years,
wouldn't
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
but
how
about
other
states
and
other
jurisdictions?
there
has
to
have
been
a
wide
variety
of
reasonable
doubt
instructions
that
have
been
given
over
time.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
wasn't
cage
just
an
application
of
winship?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
i
don't
know
that
you
can
say
that
cage
was
more
than
that.
i
would
have
thought
winship
was
the
case
that
may
have
led
to
cage.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
say
that
every
structural
error
is
a
watershed
rule
under
teague?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now
every
court
of
appeals
to
have
considered
the
question
has
said
it
has...
cage
has
to
be
applied
retroactively.
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
they're
all
wrong,
i
guess,
in
your
view.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
you
shed
any
light
for
us
on
how
many
verdicts
would
be
affected
by
our
clarification,
if
we
made
it,
that
this
must
be
applied
retroactive?
how
many
are
there?
