john
paul
stevens
what
you're
saying--
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you...
the
chief
justice
asked
earlier,
we're
focusing
on
the
word
made
retroactive
by
this
court,
and
your
position
is
sullivan
made
cage
retroactive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
my
question
is,
did
sullivan...
is
it
the
sullivan
holding
that
made
cage
retroactive,
or
statements
in
sullivan
that
made
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's
dicta
rather
than
the
holding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
quite
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
has
to
be
conveyed
accurately,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
conveyed
at
all.
we've
held
you
don't
have
to
have
a
reasonable
doubt...
a
definition
of
reasonable
doubt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
get
started,
may
i
just
ask,
do
you
agree
that
cage
was
a
new
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
just
interrupt
with
one--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
heuer,
can
i
just
interrupt
with
one--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--one
thought.
when
you
ask
a
question
whether
a
rule
is
retroactive,
i
think
you
are
really
asking
whether
the
rule
applied
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
and
are
you
arguing
that
at
the
time
this
man
was
tried
he
did
not
need
a
better
reasonable
doubt
instruction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
that
ask
the
question
what
was
the
law
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
and
you're
saying--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--he
did
not
need
a
better
instruction
than
he
got.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
it's
a
new
rule...
if
it's
a
new
rule,
he
was
not
entitled
to
that
instruction
at
the
time
of
his
trial,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
aren't
you
saying
in
response
to
justice
souter
that
we
should
read
the
word
made
to
mean
said?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
didn't
say
it
said.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
feldman,
the
petitioner
argues
in
the
alternative
that
sullivan
made
it
retroactive,
or
that
we
could
now
in
this
case
make
it
retroactive.
what
do
you
say
about
the
second
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
agree
we
could.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
do
agree
that
cage
is
a
new
rule?
