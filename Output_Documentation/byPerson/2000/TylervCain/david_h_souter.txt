justice
david
h.
souter
how
do
you
draw
the
line?
i
was
going
to
ask
the
same
question.
you
say,
well,
this
is
a
structural
error
that
is
watershed,
some
structural
errors
would
not
be.
how
do
we
tell?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
except
that
that's
not
the
way
we
explained
it
in
sullivan...
what
was
at
stake.
we
didn't
say
anything
about
accuracy
or
reliability,
as
i
understand
it,
and
as
you
quoted
from
it
a
moment
ago.
what
we
said
was
that
as
a
matter
of
definition,
what
we
mean
by
a
jury
verdict
has
not
been
observed
when
the
jury
is
operating
under
this
kind
of
reasonable
doubt
instruction.
it
had
nothing
to
do,
as
i
understand
it,
with
what
we
normally
mean
by
the
reliability
of
a
verdict,
i.e.,
was
the
person
really
guilty
or
not
guilty?
did
he
do
it,
did
he
not
do
it?
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
two
don't
synchronize
the
way
you're
arguing.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that's
the
argument,
then
why
isn't
the
structural
nature
of
this
error
essentially
irrelevant
to
your
analysis?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
court...
the
court
has
said
it's
structural,
but
in
your
answer
to
my
question,
you're
saying
the
reason
this
structural
error
is,
in
fact,
a
structural
error
which
must
be
made
retroactive
is
a
product
of
teague.
why
don't
we
simply
go
to
teague?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
if
we
go
to
teague
then,
what's
left
of
the
significance
of
sullivan?
sullivan
is
significant,
as
i
understand
it,
only
because
sullivan
indicated
that
the
first
case
was
structural,
and
yet
you
say
you
concede
that
the
structural
nature
of
it
is
not
dispositive.
if
the
structural
nature
is
not
dispositive,
then
how
can
we
tell
from
sullivan
that,
in
fact,
cage
must
be
retroactive?
we
can't.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that
were
the
case,
then
we
wouldn't
bother
with
a
teague
analysis.
we
would
say
it
satisfies
teague
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
i
don't
think
that
is
your
argument,
nor
do
i
think
it
could
be
your
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
you
are
relying
on
sullivan
not
because
sullivan
said
it's
structural,
but
because
sullivan
has
made
some
findings
which
happen
to
satisfy
teague
criteria.
that's
your
real
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
structural
nature
of
it
is
essentially
beside
the
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
would
accept
dicta.
in
other
words,
you
say
we
can
make
it
within
the
meaning
of
edpa,
even
though
we
say
it
in
dictum?
because
that's
what
we
would
be
doing.
we
would
have
to
do
it
to
decide
the
case
in
which
we
make
the
statement
so
that
our
further
statement,
and
by
the
way,
this
is
going
to
be
retroactive
would
be
dictum
so
far
as
that
case
is
concerned,
and
that
would
satisfy
the
concept
of
made
in
edpa?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
we...
if
edpa
does
not
require
a
holding,
in
other
words,
for
example,
an
appeal
from
a
first
habeas
in
which
there's
no
question
that
the
issue
can
get
up
and
in
which
case
our
declaration
would
be
a
holding.
if
no
holding
is
required,
if
dictum
is
satisfactory,
why
shouldn't
a
straightforward
application,
if
there
is
such
a
thing
of
teague,
be
equally
satisfactory?
i
could
understand
the
line
if
you
were
saying
it's
got
to
be
a
holding
of
the
court,
but
if
it
hasn't
got
to
be
a
holding
of
the
court,
why
is
teague
less
worthy
than
dictum?
justice
david
h.
souter
when
the
defendant
takes
an
appeal
on
the
second.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
terms
of
what?
the
gatekeeper
should
allow
through...
the
gatekeeper
on
your
theory,
i
take
it,
shouldn't
allow
anything
through
until
there
had
been
a
conclusive
determination.
and
i
take
it
on
your
view
that
requires
a
holding
so
that
the
only
holding
that
you
could
look
to
would
be
a
holding,
if
the
system
works
right,
would
be
a
holding
on
first
habeas.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
distinction.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
any
case
you
wouldn't
be
satisfied
with
dicta
from
a
case
on
direct
review,
or
a
statement
from
a
case
on
direct
review?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but...
maybe
i
don't
understand
your
answer.
i
mean,
the
only
determination
that
the
gatekeepers
were
supposed
to
make
was
the
determination
as
to
whether
the
case
should
go
forward
and
that
determined...
that
turns
on
the
retroactivity
of
the
decision.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
if
the
decision
was
not
retroactive
before
it
gets
here,
the
gatekeeper
should
have
said,
no,
we
should
reverse
them
on
that,
and
we
should
reach
no
other
issue.
and
if
we
reach
another
issue,
we're
in
dictum.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
your
view,
you
are
saying
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
they
were
wrong,
but
we're
going
to
forget
that
because
we
are
now
going
to
say
something
which
we
had
not
said,
which
had
we
said
it
earlier,
would
have
made
them
right.
that's
the
reason.
