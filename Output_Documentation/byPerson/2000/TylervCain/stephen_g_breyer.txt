justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
think
that
it
is
the
unmistakable
import,
to
use
your
words,
of
the
court's
opinion,
earlier
opinion
in
cage,
that
it
was
meant
to
be
retroactive.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
sullivan.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the...
is
this...
we
tried
to
look
this
up,
and
i'll
tell
you
what
i
found
and
see
if
it
corresponds...
either
of
you...
that
there
were
six
or
seven
states
right
after
cage
that
had
similar
instructions,
then
the
court
decided
victor
v.
nebraska,
and
that
seemed
to
suggest
that
all
but
in
one
or
two,
maybe
the
louisiana
and
new
york,
that
the
instructions
were
okay.
we
found
twenty
one
reversals
in
new
york
on
this
ground,
and
some
in
louisiana,
and
no
others.
i
mean,
that's
just
a
quick
check,
so
it
would
be
in
new
york
and
possibly
louisiana,
if
that's
right.
i
mean,
you
know
more
about
it
than
i
do
and
have
looked
into
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
that's
all,
why
is
it
a
watershed?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
if
they're
only
going
to
affect
fifty
or
sixty
people,
why
is
it
a
watershed
rule?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
isn't
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
wouldn't
this
one
be,
then?
why
wouldn't
this
one
be?
that
is,
what
their
argument
is...
i
mean
you
might
find
it
easier
to
address
the
specific.
the
specific,
i
take
it,
is
that
before
cage
and
sullivan,
people
always
understood
that
judges
can
make
mistakes
on
jury
instructions.
they
do
every
day
of
the
week,
and
some
are
very
important.
but
after
cage
and
sullivan,
we
suddenly
see
that
a
misdescription
of
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
is
like
no
other.
it
is
so
important
that
automatically
you
get
a
new
trial
no
matter
what.
the
only
other
thing
that
compares
is
not
having
a
lawyer
at
all.
so
before
the
two
cases
we
thought,
yes,
you
could
make
a
mistake
in
the
instructions,
maybe
even
a
bad
one.
after
the
instructions,
we
recognized
that
that
kind
of
mistake
is
unique
among
all
others
and
like
not
having
a
lawyer.
now,
that's
their
argument,
i
think,
as
to
the
significance
in
you're
reshaping
our
legal
thinking
about
a
jury
standard
misdescription.
all
right?
so
now,
on
your
principle,
why
isn't
that
watershed,
or
why
isn't
it
watershed
irrespective
of
your
principle?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
been
eight
years
since
the
court
decided
sullivan.
you
would
have
thought
that
if
there
are
a
thousand
people
there
under
the...
in
respect
to
whom
the
trial
courts,
in
fact,
used
this
wrong
standard,
some
of
them
would
have
thought
of
this
idea
of
bringing
a
habeas
petition.
i
mean,
are
there
any
other
habeas
petitions
filed?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
all
of
those
thousand--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay.
so
is
that...
that
number
of
a
thousand
is
the
number
of
habeas
petitions
that
have
been
filed
that
include
this
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
many
habeas
petitions
have
been
filed,
to
your
knowledge,
that
include
this
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
come
across
in
your
personal
experience
more
than
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
think
of
unmistakable
imports?
sorry,
were
you
finished?
were
you
finished
in
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
unmistakable
import
is
their
idea,
that
sometimes
this
court
might
not
say,
and
it
is
retroactive
on
collateral
review.
rather
it
is
the
unmistakable
import
of
the
opinion
that
it
isn't.
is
that
good
enough
for
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
can
you
answer
just
yes
or
no,
i'm
not
sure
whether
you...
i
said,
is
that
good
enough
for
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
put
up
with
the
anomaly
that
that
creates?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even
if,
for
example,
there
were
such
cases
just
obvious...
like
flag
burning,
the
court
says
flag
burning
is...
you
can't
punish
that,
or
you
can't
punish
writing
an
editorial
in
a
newspaper
criticizing
the
government.
or,
you
know...
and
so
there
is
a
certain
conduct
that
now
they
cannot
punish.
it's
absolutely
clear
that
it's
in
that
category.
this
court
has
now
made
certain
conduct
unpunishable
under
the
criminal
law,
and
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
teague
says
is
retroactive,
and
even
where
it's
absolutely
plain
that
it
is
the
reason,
it
still,
in
your
opinion,
is
not
retroactive
unless
the
court
adds
the
words
and
it
is
retroactive.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
fair
because
then
if
it's
this
court...
i
mean,
it's
this
court
and
not
some
other
court
that
writes
an
opinion,
the
unmistakable
import
of
which
is
that
it
is
retroactive
on
collateral
review.
that
would
satisfy
you,
though
you
think...
if
i'm
right,
that
satisfies
you,
but
i'm
guessing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean...
no,
i'm
sorry--
--i
just
want
to
be...
in
other
words,
unmistakable
import
isn't
good
enough,
you
have
to
say
it
in
those
words.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
it
that
the
only
conclusive
determination
by
this
court
could
be
a
determination
on
a
first
habeas.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
you'll
run
into
a
statute
of
limitations
problem,
because
the
statute
of
limitations
seems
to
say
that
it
has
to...
you
have
a
year
after
the
right
of
cert
was
initially
recognized
by
the
supreme
court,
and
so
you're
going
to
have
to
do
within
the
year...
it's
going
to
have
to
come
up
on
habeas
to
the
supreme
court
in
an
instance,
let's
say,
where
it's
absolutely
clear
from
the
reasoning
that
it
is
meant
to
apply
retroactively,
so
you'll
never...
i
mean,
it'll
put
this
court
in
an
impossible
situation,
wouldn't
it?
