mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
in
june
1993
when
this
court
handed
down
its
decision
in
sullivan
v.
louisiana,
it
did
something
it
had
done
in
only
five
other
instances
which
spanned
the
preceding
seventy
six
years...
it
characterized
an
error
as
structural.
the
holding
of
the
sullivan
decision,
which
reaffirmed
and
explained
this
court's
decision
in
cage,
is
what
makes
melvin
tyler's
conviction
unconstitutional,
but
it
is
the
court's
rationale
underlying
the
sullivan
decision
that
makes
sullivan
retroactively
available
to
melvin
tyler,
and
that
is
because
the
rationale
underlying
sullivan
also
satisfies
the
second
exception
to
teague's
policy
of
nonretroactivity
to
cases
on
collateral
review.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
edpa.
the
statutory
argument
is,
your
honor,
that
edpa
in
this
case
would
be
purely
theoretical
if
this
court
finds
that
mr.
tyler's
case
satisfies
the
second
teague
exception.
having
found
that
it
did
so,
it
could
then
make
cage
retroactive.
and
had
it
made
cage
retroactive,
he
would
then
satisfy
the
statutory
language
to
edpa.
i
want
to
make
clear
at
the
outset
that
we
are
not
contending
that
all
structural
errors
fall
within
teague's
second
exception;
we
are
simply
saying
that
this
one
does,
and
it
does
so
because
the
new
rule
first
announced
in
cage
requires
the
observance
of
a
procedure
that
is
implicit--
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
--you
yourselves
must
have
said
that
it
is
retroactive
in
a
successive
petition.
this
court...
when
i
say
must
have
said,
this
court
must
have
done
something
to
communicate
that
the
new
rule
is
retroactive.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
well,
made
is
the
word
i'm
looking
for,
your
honor.
this
court
must
have
done
something
that
made
the
new
rule
retroactive.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
that
it
would
be
clear
that
the
unmistakable
import
of
an
action
taken
by
this
court
would
be
that
the
new
rule
that
had
been
announced
was
to
be
applied
retroactively.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
precisely,
your
honor.
that
it
need
not
have
said
so
expressly.
and...
to
return
to
the
point,
we
are
not
contending
that
this
applies...
that
all
structural
errors
fall
within
teague's
second
exception.
it
is
simply
that
this
court
made
very,
very
clear
in
sullivan
that
that
particular
structural
error
was
based
on
the
two
matters
that
were
central
in
fulminante
v.
arizona.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
no,
i
would
say
that
it
was
the
unmistakable
import,
your
honor,
in
the
court's
opinion
in
sullivan--
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
--that
cage
was
meant
to
be
applied
retroactively,
and
that
unmistakable
import
was
received
by
seven
circuit
courts
of
appeal
that
have
applied
cage
retroactively
since
sullivan.
every
lower
court
that
has
considered
the
new
rule
in
cage
since
this
court's
holding
in
sullivan
has
said
that
sullivan
compels
the
application
of
cage
on
a
retroactive
basis.
the
respondent
in
this
case
and
amici
have
advanced
two
principal
arguments
for
denying
melvin
tyler
relief
in
this
case.
the
first
would
be
the
language
of
edpa
which
requires
that
a
matter
relies
on
a
new
rule
of
constitutional
law
made
retroactive
to
cases
on
collateral
review
by
the
supreme
court
that
was
previously
unavailable,
and
then
finally
this
court's
holding
in
teague
v.
lane
that
new
rules
of
constitutional
law
cannot
be
applied
retroactively
to
cases
on
collateral
review
unless
they
fall
within
one
of
two,
as
the
court
has
described,
narrow
exceptions.
as
i
said
in
response
to
chief
justice's
question,
from
our
perspective
now
that
we
are
before
the
court,
the
first
obstacle
is
purely
theoretical.
if
this
court
should
decide
that
teague
requires
that
the
new
rule
announced
in
cage
as
explained
by
sullivan
should
be
applied
retroactively,
and
it
simply
says
in
this
case,
which
it
has
the
power
to
do,
and
as
all...
as
amici
has
conceded,
that
it's
made
retroactive
and
applies
it
to
mr.
tyler's
case,
and
that
resolves
the
issue.
obviously,
not
every
case
that
turns
on
the
meaning
of
2244(b)(2)(a)
is
going
to
be
heard
by
this
court,
so
if
the
court
decides
that
it
should
address
the
statutory
question
now,
we
would
submit
that
the
better
interpretation
is
the
one
that
has
been
offered
by
the
third
and
the
ninth
circuits
in
the
two
cases
of
west
v.
vaughn
and
flowers
v.
walter...
that
the
phrase
made
retroactive
to
cases
on
collateral
review
by
the
supreme
court
does
not
require
the
express
ruling
of
this
court.
we
are
not
saying,
as
the
ninth
circuit
has
said
in
flowers
v.
walter,
that
all
cases
that
should
be
retroactive
under
teague
are,
in
fact,
retroactive.
we
are
simply
saying
that
the
word
made
in
this
case
should
be
given
its
simple
plain
meaning
of
caused
to
be
the
case.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
that
would
be,
your
honor,
but
if
that
were
to
be
the
case,
it
creates
an
entire
host
of
problems.
first,
i
think
that
the
court...
that
congress
had
before
it
the
possibility
of
a
wide
variety
of
language
such
as
held
by,
determined
to
be
retroactive
by
the
supreme
court.
the
first
is
that
this...
the
use
of
the
word
made
as
not
requiring
an
express
decision
by
this
court
avoids
the
unequal
treatment
of
similarly
situated
petitioners.
you
would
have
a
first
petitioner
who
received
the...
who
a
lower
court
could
say,
well,
yes,
the
court
had
made
that
new
rule
retroactive,
whereas
a
second
petitioner
identically
situated
for
teague
purposes
would
not
receive
the
benefit
of
the
rule.
the
second
is
that
this
interpretation
of
made
retroactive
is
the
only
one
that
works
with
the
statute
of
limitations
that
edpa
has
created.
if...
if
we
are
to
interpret
the
rule
as
requiring
an
express
ruling
from
this
court
that
something
has
been
made
retroactive,
when
the
statute
of
limitations
begins
to
run
when
the
new
rule
has
been
recognized,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
briefs,
you
could
have
a
statute
of
limitations
expiring
before
this
court
ever
ruled
on
whether
something
had
been
made
retroactive.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
were
to
take
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
that
maybe
the
statute
of
limitations
doesn't
begin
running
until
this
court
recognizes
the
retroactivity
for
successive
petitions,
the
statute
of
limitations
would
never
begin
to
run.
so
you
would
have
successive--
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
--well,
but
that's
precisely
the
type
of
decision
that
lower
courts
make
every
day
in
terms
of
first
petitions,
as
was
done
in
this
case.
the
fifth
circuit
had
determined
that
sullivan
had
been
made
retroactive...
cage
had
been
made
retroactive
by
sullivan,
and
it
applied
it
to
all
first
petitioners.
so
i
don't
think,
your
honor,
that
we're
placing
an
additional
burden
on
the
lower
court
because,
quite
candidly,
we
are
only
talking
about
a
very,
very,
very
small
category
of
new
rules
that
would
have
been
made
retroactive.
in
fact,
in
the
eleven
decisions
that
this...
in
which
this
court
has
considered
new
rules
of
law
since
teague
was
handed
down,
none
have
been
found
to
qualify
for
the
second
teague
exception.
in
fact,
this
would
be
the
first
new
rule
under
the
second
teague
exception.
so
to
respond
more
fully
to
your
question,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
we
are
placing
an
undue
burden
on
the
lower
courts,
because
your
honors'
interpretation
of
requiring
an
express
ruling
from
this
court
would
mean
that
a
successive
habeas
petitioner
under
a
new
rule
was
either
too
early
or
too
late,
but
never
on
time.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
the...
my
understanding
is,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
this
instruction
was
the
standard
bench
book
instruction
for
orleans
parish
for
a
period
of
time.
as
to
the
number
of--
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
--there
were
unquestionably
a
wide
variety
of
reasonable
doubt
instructions,
but
i
don't
think
that
there
would
be
many
states,
and
i
have
not
seen
many
cases
indicated,
that
would
meet
the
requirements
of
cage
that
have
all
three
of
the
elements
that
cage
had
that
would
be
condemned.
and
the
best
example
would
be
this
court's
decision
in
victor,
which
followed
after
sullivan,
in
which
it
said,
no,
these
type
of
instructions
that
cage
is
where
we
draw
the
line,
victor
is
simply
not,
does
not
form
part
of
that--
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
--your
honor,
in
all
the
reading
i
have
done
everywhere,
i
have
never
seen
an
instruction
as
bad
as
the
cage
instruction
from
any
other
jurisdiction.
this...
and
in
fact
the
instruction
that
was
given
in
melvin
tyler's
case
is
worse
than
the
one
that
was
given
in
cage.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
my
understanding
is
that
very,
very
few
states
gave
this
type
of
instructions.
the
ones
that
were
giving
it
certainly
corrected
it
after
cage,
and
the
number
of
people
that
would
ultimately
be
affected
by
a
finding
that
sullivan
compels
the
retroactivity
of
cage
would
be
fifty
to
sixty
people
would
be--
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
--beg
your
pardon?
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
it
is
a
watershed
rule,
your
honor,
because
what
happened
in
sullivan
changed
the
way
that
we
understood
reasonable
doubt.
it
changed--
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
--cage
is
the
new
rule,
your
honor.
it
is
the
ruling
in
sullivan
explaining
cage
that
makes
it
a
watershed
rule.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
cage
is
the
new
rule,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
cage--
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
--winship
was
the
principle.
cage
was
the
application.
winship
did
not
address
jury
instructions,
cage
did.
for
the
first
time
in
cage,
this
court
said
that
there
is
a
reasonable
doubt
instruction
that
we
can
give
that
is
error,
and
when
we
got
to
sullivan--
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
it
was
sullivan
which
was
a
unanimous
opinion
by
this
court
after
full
briefing
on
the
merit,
saying
that
a
cage
error
is
structural
that
represented
truly
the
paradigm
shift.
that's
why
it
becomes
the
watershed
rule.
sullivan
tells
you
for
the
first
time
and
makes
it
clear
that
a
reasonable
doubt
jury
instruction,
unlike
any
other
jury
instruction
that
you
can
give
at
a
trial,
if
it
is
flawed,
flaws
the
entire
process.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
well,
cage
is
the
new
rule,
your
honor,
and
it
is
sullivan's
explanation
of
cage--
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
--is
the
watershed.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
cage
has
been
recognized
as
the
new
rule
because
for
the
first
time...
winship
did
not
address
jury
instructions,
your
honor,
cage
did.
for
the
first
time,
the
new
rule
becomes
that
when
a
court
gives
a
reasonable
doubt
jury
instruction
that
misdefines
reasonable
doubt,
and
in
effect
lowers
the
state's
burden
of
proof,
you
have
violated
the
due
process
rule.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
well,
cage
would
be
the
new
rule,
your
honor,
and
it
is
sullivan's--
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
--well,
as
explained
by
sullivan--
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
--it
is
a
shift
in
the
paradigm,
is
the
best
way
to
explain
it.
to
use
an
analogy,
i
would
say
that
gideon
would
be
the
continental
divide,
and
cage
would
be
the
watershed.
what
you
really
have
is
a
watershed--
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
cage
is
no
gideon...
i
will
admit
that
cage
is
no
gideon,
but
it
is
still
watershed
because
it
has
changed
our
thinking
about
the
centrality
of
the
reasonable
doubt
instruction.
what
sullivan
teaches
us
because
it
tells
us
that
a
cage
type
error
is
structural--
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
--we
knew--
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
--what
is
watershed
about
cage
as
explained
by
sullivan...
i
don't
think
that
you
can
view
the
two
in
isolation.
as
explained
by
sullivan,
which
identified
cage
as
structural
error,
that
what
is
watershed
about
it
is
that
when
you
have
had
a
reasonable
doubt
jury
instruction
of
the
type
given
in
cage
and
sullivan,
you
have
not
had
a
trial
by
jury
within
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment.
that's
not
my
language,
that's
the
language
of
the
court.
that
there
has
been
no
jury
verdict
of
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
but
sullivan
builds
on
cage,
and
you
can't
have,
i
guess,
one
without
the
other.
i
wish
the
two
had
come
together,
but
what
i
have
is
cage
first
announcing
the
new
rule
and
then
sullivan
explaining
the
import
of
the
court's
decision
in
cage.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
statements
in
sullivan,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
it's
not
dicta.
it's
the
rationale,
and
the
rationale
was
precisely
following
arizona
v.
fulminante.
that
as
arizona
v.
fulminante
defined
structural
error,
it
had
two
components.
the
first
component
was
that
a
structural
error
deprives
a
defendant
of
a
basic
protection
or
right.
and
the
second
component
is
that
that
protection
or
right
is
one
without
which
the
criminal
trial
cannot
reliably
serve
its
purpose
as
a
vehicle
for
determining
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
you
draw
the
line
by
looking
to
the
two
teague
factors,
your
honor,
and
those
two
teague
factors
are
that
we
have
to
be
dealing
with
a
rule
that
requires
the
observance
of
a
procedure
that
is
implicit
in
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty,
which
sullivan
tells
us
we
unquestionably
are.
we
are
dealing
with
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
trial
by
jury.
and
then
there
is
the
second
problem
of
the
teague
analysis,
which
is
the
reliability
factor.
and
because
of
cage
and
sullivan,
we
know
that
when
you
have
an
erroneous
reasonable
doubt
instruction
such
as
the
one
in
cage,
sullivan
and
tyler,
that
you
have...
that
the
likelihood
of
an
accurate
conviction
has
been
seriously
diminished.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
they
do,
your
honor,
if
you
go
more
into
the
structure.
the
reason
you
have
been
deprived
of
a
jury
verdict
within
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment.
for
that
you
have
to
go
all
the
way
back
to
in
re
winship.
and
what
we
understand
from
in
re
winship
is
that
there
is
only
one
measure
of
reliability
within
a
criminal
trial,
and
that
is
the
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
standard.
presumably
as
you
push
the
burden
of
proof
to
higher
levels,
the
likelihood
of
an
improper
or
erroneous
conviction
is
lessened,
and
that
if
you
require
proof
beyond
all
doubt,
you
would
have...
certainly
you
would
not
have
any
innocent
people
hopefully
convicted.
and
so
what
winship
tells
you
is
that
it
is
that
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
standard
that,
quote,
from
winship,
plays
a
vital
role
in
the
american
scheme
of
criminal
procedure,
because
it
is
the
prime
instrument
for
reducing
the
risk
of
convictions
resting
on
factual
error.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
it
is...
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
court
has...
it
is
not
irrelevant,
because
the
court
has
already
made
those
findings
as
to
what
a
cage
or
sullivan
type
jury
instruction
means.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
we
can,
and--
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
--what
you
can
tell
from
sullivan
is
that
the
court
has,
in
essence,
found
that
these
two
components
of
the
original
structural
error
test
in
fulminante
are
congruent
with
the
two
components
of
the
teague
retro--
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
--no,
that
is
not
my
argument,
your
honor.
i'm
simply
saying
that
the
court,
having
made
that
type
of
findings
and
having
set
forth
that
rationale
for
a
finding
of
structural
error
in
that
case...
because
there
could
have
been
a
finding
of...
there
can
be
findings
of
structural
error
that
don't
satisfy
the
teague
analysis,
and
obviously
we
wouldn't
rely
on
them,
then.
we're
simply
relying
on
sullivan
because
it's
made
the
findings
for
us.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
precisely,
your
honor.
but
the
reason
we--
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
--the
centrality
of
cage
is...
what
it
told
us
for
the
first
time
is
that
somehow
the
message
of
what
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
has
to
be
conveyed
to
a
jury.
otherwise
you
have
no
sixth...
trial
within
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
you
don't
have
to
define
reasonable
doubt,
but
if
you
do
define
reasonable
doubt,
it
has
to
be
defined
accurately.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
oh,
absolutely,
your
honor.
if
reasonable
doubt
is
never
defined
for
a
jury,
if
the
jury
is
not
told
something
about
reasonable
doubt--
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
--proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt...
they
do
not
have
to
be
told
what
reasonable
doubt
is.
it's
simply
that
if
they
are
told
what
it
is,
that
is
must
be
defined
accurately.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
you
have
to
make
clear
what
the
burden
of
proof
is
in
a
criminal
trial,
and--
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
--that
the
burden
is
on
the
state
to
prove--
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
--unless
there
are
further
questions
from
the
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
any
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
to
respond
to
justice
o'connor's
question
regarding
the
number
of
people
who
might
be
affected,
the
number
one
thousand
i
would
submit
is
very
inaccurate.
this
instruction
was
not
given
in
all
criminal
cases
in
orleans
parish.
it
would
also
be
subject
to
the
statute
of
limitations
under
edpa.
following
sullivan,
people
had
to
file
cage
claims
saying
i
had
a
cage
instruction.
and
so
the
number
of
people...
and
this
is
based
purely
on
an
estimate
from
inmate
counsel
at
the
louisiana
state
prison...
there
might
be
fifty
or
sixty
people
still
in
prison
who
had
gotten
a
cage
instruction
and,
even
then,
since
we
are
only
dealing
with
the
retroactivity
issue,
they
would
still
have
to
surmount
all
of
the
very
formidable
procedural
obstacles
that
otherwise
apply
in
habeas
cases.
the
reason
that
mr.
tyler
did
not
raise
this
in
his
first
petition
to
federal
court
is
because
it
wasn't
available
to
him.
his
first
petition
was
in
1988,
cage
was
handed
down
in
1990.
sullivan
didn't
come
along
until
1993,
and
as
soon
as
sullivan
came
along,
mr.
tyler
timely
filed
his
habeas
petition.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
he's
serving
a
life
sentence,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
v.
larson,
jr.
life
sentence.
and
in
terms
of
the
unmistakable
import
of
this
court's
decision
in
sullivan,
seven
circuit
courts
of
appeal
had
considered
this
question,
one
of
them
en
banc.
not
one
judge
in
any
of
those
courts
has
ever
suggested
that
sullivan
did
not
compel
a
finding
that
cage
was
to
be
applied
retroactively.
in
terms
of
whether
there
is
some
ground
between
gideon
and
cage
in
terms
of
watershed
rules,
i
would
suggest
that
in
justice
harlen's
concurring
opinion
in
mackey,
he
made
it
clear
that
that
category,
that
second
category,
does
have
cases,
and
that
cases
will
arise
in
that
second
category.
it's
not
an
empty
box
as
one
of
the
amici
suggested
in
their
brief,
it
is
a
box
into
which
we
put
rules,
new
rules
of
law,
that
are
fundamental.
and
what
is
fundamental
about
sullivan
is
that
it
tells
us
that
if
a
jury
is
given
a
yardstick
that
is
two
feet
long,
that's
not
sufficient.
it
has
to
be
accurate
because
that
is
the
central
point
of
any
jury
trial,
criminal
jury
trial.
there
are
some
decisions
that
are...
some
errors
that
are
so
fundamental
that
a
conviction
obtained
with
that
type
of
process
should
never
be
final.
that's
what
justice
harlen
recognized
in
his
entire
retroactivity
doctrine.
if
we
obtained
a
jury
verdict
by
flipping
a
coin--
