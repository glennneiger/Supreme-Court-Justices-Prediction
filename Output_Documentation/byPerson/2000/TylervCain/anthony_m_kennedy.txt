justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
the
other
hand
there
is
a
thirty
day
requirement
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
decide
the
issue,
and
that
indicates,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
only
thing
they
can
do
is
look
to
see
whether
this
court
has
decided
it.
because
otherwise
they
have
to
decide
a
difficult
substantive
issue
within
thirty
days.
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
that
is
consistent
with
the
statutory
scheme.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
am
quite
surprised
that
you
say
that
cage
is
not
the
watershed
rule.
i
think
that
really
has
to
be
your...
this
would
have
been
very
odd
for
us
to
issue
cage
and
then
only
say
in
sullivan
that
it's
a
watershed
rule.
that's
a
very
strange
holding.
it
seems
to
me
that
cage
has
to
be
the
watershed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
everyone,
i
think,
would
agree
that
it's
the
new
rule.
the
question
is
whether
it's
a
watershed
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
watershed
rule
is
like
gideon
v.
wainwright,
i
take
it?
is
that
a
paradigm?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no...
well,
now
we've
got
three
different
terms.
gideon
is
a
watershed
rule,
could
we
stipulate
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
tempted
to
say
i
know
gideon,
and
cage
is
no
gideon.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
didn't
think
cage
made
it
apparent
to
us
for
the
first
time
that
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
our
system.
we
knew
that,
before
cage,
during
cage
and
after
cage.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
what's
watershed
about
cage?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
assume
that
we
have
never
said
whether
or
not
cage
is
retroactive...
let's
assume
that.
on
a
successive
habeas
petition,
how
could
we
ever
make
that
determination
substantively?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
only
thing
that
the
court
of
appeals
can
answer,
according
to
you
i
take
it,
is
whether
or
not
we
have
said
that,
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
right
that
we've
never
said
that,
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
matter?
can
we
ever
reach
the
question
on
a
successive
petition?
we're
talking
on
the
merits.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
we
have
to
wait
for
a
first
habeas
petition
or
a
direct
review
to
say
this?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
answer
to
the
question
justice
breyer
asked
your
colleague,
where
primary
conduct
is
held
to
be
not
punishable
as
a
matter
of
law,
is
that
also
subject
to
the
same
retroactivity
principles
we're
talking
about,
or
is
there
a
different
rule?
if
the
first
rule
of
teague
is
involved,
i.e.,
conduct
which
cannot
be
punishable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
if
it's
beyond
the
power
of
the
law
to
punish?
i
mean,
isn't
that
somehow
automatically
retroactive?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
how
can
we
reach
the
substantive
retroactivity
question
here
if
we
assume
that
we've
never
said
it
before...
that's
the
end,
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
to
dismiss.
so
how
can
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--no,
but
if
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct.
