mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
there
are
two
questions
presented
here.
the
first
concerns
the
meaning
of
section
2244,
and
the
second
concerns
whether
cage
fits
the
second
teague
exception.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
begin
with
the
second
question
presented.
the...
i
submit
that
the
principal
issue
here
has
less
to
do
with
cage
and
sullivan
than
it
does
with
teague's
implication
for
a
watershed
rule.
i
think
clearly
cage
conveys
an
element
of
accuracy
and
fairness.
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
yes,
your
honor.
teague
gives
us
an
example
of
a
watershed
rule
in
gideon
and
provides
a
definition
that
a
watershed
rule
is
a
rule
which
alters
our
understanding
of
the
bedrock
procedural
elements
necessary
for
a
fair
trial.
our
principal
point
is
that...
the
question
is,
does
this
definition
encompass
the
notion
that
a
watershed
rule
can
redefine
an
existing
procedural
element,
or
does
the
watershed
rule
need
to
announce
a
new
previously
unarticulated
procedural
element?
i
would
submit
that
to
adopt
the
first
definition
would
require
the
rule
so
redefine
an
existing
procedural
element
that
we
have,
in
a
sense,
created
a
new
bedrock
procedural
element,
and
it
is
insufficient
to
simply
alter
our
understanding
and
illuminate
an
existing
procedural
element
in
some
way.
that
the
new
rule
must
tell
us
a
fundamentally
new
principle
that
is
applicable
in
each
and
every
trial
that
should
be
conducted
in
the
future.
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
well,
i
think
you
need
to
go
back
in
history
to
an
extent,
and
a
lot
of
our
principles
have
not
evolved
in
such
a
dramatic
fashion.
if
you
take
winship,
although
it
made
it
constitutional,
the
notion
of
reasonable
doubt
had
been
you
know
around
for,
you
know,
as
long
as
anyone
could
remember
at
that
time.
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
you
know,
i
think
you
look
to
the
bill
of
rights
and
the
defendant's
opportunity
to
confront
the
witness
against
him,
to
have
a
public
trial,
a
fair
and
impartial
jury,
and--
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
--well,
in
the
sense
that--
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
--well,
in
the
sense
that
to
be
a
watershed
rule...
a
watershed
rule
requires
two
components.
one
is
that
it
be
the
fundamental
foundation
that...
and
that
it...
to
become
a
watershed
rule
it
has
to
announce
a
new
principle,
yet
encompassed
in
that
definition
is
the
fact
that
it
forms
an
essential
bedrock
procedural
element.
so
the
examples
i
gave
you,
correct,
would
not
be
watershed
rules.
they
would--
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
--i
think
the
question
of
structural
error
is
distinct
from
retroactivity.
i
believe
teague
requires
an
additional
component.
moreover,
the
structural
error
of
a
misdescription
of
reasonable
doubt
has
more
to
do
with
whether
or
not
we
can
get
our
hands
on
what's
going
on
there,
whether
or
not
the
effect
of
the
error
is
quantitative.
we
simply
cannot
look
at
the
verdict
and
conduct
an
analysis
because
we
don't--
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
that's
our
position,
your
honor.
and
i
think
it
comes
from
the
fundamental
misunderstanding
that
a
watershed
rule
must
announce
a
new
bedrock
principle.
it
cannot
simply
cast
new
light
on
an
existing
bedrock
principle.
and
although,
you
know,
we
have
cited
the
same
language
as
the
various
courts
of
appeals,
that
the
rule
alter
our
understanding--
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
--of
the
bedrock
procedural
elements
for
a
fair
trial,
then
it's
clear--
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
i
think
the
retroactivity...
whatever
the--
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
--that
he
was
entitled
to
a
reasonable
doubt--
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
--well,
your
honor,
correct.
but
i
think
that
at
the
time
of
anyone's
trial
you
can
say
that
he
was
entitled
to
confront
the
witnesses
against
him,
yet
we
could
create
a
new
rule
which
shows
that
a
videotape
conference
was
not
the
equivalent
of
confronting
the
witnesses
against
you.
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
well,
you
know,
this
language
fell
within
the
logical
compass
of
the
reasoning
in
winship,
but,
you
know,
i
don't
think
that
anything
we
knew
before
dictated
or
compelled
the
conclusion
that
this
instruction
failed
to
accurately
delineate
the
standard
of
reasonable
doubt,
so
this--
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
--i
checked
with
the
department
of
corrections,
and
there
are
1.057
inmates
in
angola
currently
whose
trials
came
from
orleans
parish,
and
whose
trials
commenced
approximately
a
year
before
cage.
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
that's
all
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
there's
hardly
a
habeas
petition
filed
in
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
that
does
not
include
a--
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
--no.
that
is
simply
the
number
of
inmates--
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
--i
can't
answer
that,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
oh,
yes.
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
clearly
over
a
hundred...
you
know,
in
the
hundreds,
since
cage
was
announced.
i
could
say
that
any
given
year
i
answer
thirty
to
forty
myself
as
a
member
of
an
office
of
seven
or
eight
attorneys,
including
the
case
here.
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that
sullivan
constitutes
a
prima
facie
showing
that
cage
was
made
retroactive
by
this
court.
sullivan
concerns
a
different
issue
other
than
retroactivity,
and
that,
you
know...
i
just
don't
see...
you
can
make
a
prima
facie
showing
that
this
court
has
ever
made
cage
retroactive,
even
though
the
standard
is
simply
prima
facie.
i
think
that
goes
more
to
the
prima
facie
and
this
also
goes
to
whether
or
not
the
particular
individual
actually
had
an
instruction
that
resembled
cage--
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
--yes,
your
honor.
and
it
goes
to,
you
know,
there's
a
fundamental
difference
between
what...
how
you
consider
made
retroactive,
and
whether
or
not
a
decision
such
as
sullivan
can
stand
as
a
determination
that
this
court
has
explicitly
held
or
ruled
that
a
particular
new
rule
should
be
applied
retroactively.
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
well,
i
believe--
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
--well,
i
believe...
i
believe
that
congress
believed
that
the
finality
concerns
were
so
critical
in
terms
of
second
and
successive
habeas
petitioners
that
it
would
leave
that
judgment
to
this
court,
and
presumably
that
would
occur
at
the
time
of
a
first
habeas
petitioner.
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
correct.
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
your
honor,
i
believe
the
fair
reading
of
the
statute
makes
the
inclusion
of
this
court
superfluous
under
that
rationale.
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
no,
it's
not,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
because
i
believe
the
only
fair
natural
reading
of
the
statute
is
that
congress
put
such
a...
had
such
great
concern
over
second
and
successive
habeas
petitions
that
they
have
given
this
court
the
additional
responsibility
of
announcing
the
retroactivity
of
a
rule
before
a
second
or
successive
habeas
petitioner
can
come
back
to
court
and
challenge
his
conviction.
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
your
honor,
in
cases...
the
first
exception
cases
clearly
present
a
more
difficult
argument
than
the
second
exception.
nevertheless,
i
believe
that
the
congress
believed
that
cases
that
fall
under
the
second
exception
are
never
so
clear
as
to
not
require
a
statement
from
this
court.
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
that
would
satisfy
the
congressional
concerns
regarding
the
retroactive
application.
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
well,
my
principal
argument
would
be
this
case
itself...
that
the
courts
have
seized
on
the
conclusion
that
sullivan,
without
deciding
any
retroactivity
concerns,
because
it
found
the
error
structural,
made
it
retroactive.
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
yes.
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
and
in
the
case
of
second
successive
habeas
petitioners,
you
know,
they
may
have
to
wait
until
this
court
has
had
an
opportunity
to
address
a
first
habeas
that
raises
that
issue.
they
may
have
a
legitimate
claim
to
file
but
because
they
are
second
or
successive
habeas
petitioners
as
opposed
to
a
first
habeas
petitioner
who,
upon
announcement
of
the
rule,
can
go
into
federal
court
and
say,
look,
i
think
this
ought
to
apply
to
me
even
though
i
was
tried
before
the
decision
was
held,
and
the
second
successive
petitioner,
he
might
have
to
sit
and
wait
until
that
speculative
argument
has
been--
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
--right.
mr.
charles
e.
f.
heuer
exactly,
your
honor.
the
finality
concerns
for
second
and
successive
petitioners
is
so
strong
that
they
created
a
separate
gateway
for
them
to
enter
in
order
to
present
claims
of
this
nature
on
a
second
petition.
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
have
nothing
further.
