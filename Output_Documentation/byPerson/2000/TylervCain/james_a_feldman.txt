mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
petitioner
may
not
base
his
petition
in
this
case
on
cage,
because
the
rule
of
that
case
has
not
been
and
should
not
be
made
retroactive
by
this
court.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
think
there
is.
i
think
the
fairest
reading
of
the
statute
is
that
it
has
to
be
made...
the
specific
rule
relied
upon
by
the
second
petitioner
has
to
be
made
retroactive
by
the
supreme
court,
not
by
some
other
court--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i
think
the
fairest
reading
is
what
i
said.
i
do
think
you
could
distinguish
some
if
the
court...
i
think
the
fairest
reading
is
what
i
said,
but
you
could
distinguish
some
cases
in
which...
like
the
eichmann
case,
for
example,
perhaps.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
eichmann
case,
the
flag
burning
case,
in
which...
you
could
distinguish
some
cases
under
the
first
teague
exception
in
which
the
application
of
that
exception
is
just
absolutely
crystal
clear,
but
i
don't
think
all
first
exception
cases
are
even
close
to
that,
and
i
don't
think
that
any
second
exception
cases
would
be
like
that.
so
although
you
could
say
an
absolutely
clear
first
teague
exception
case
could
satisfy
the
made
retroactive
standard,
i
actually
think
the
better
rule
is
what
congress
provided,
which
is
that
it
be
this
court
and
not
some
other
court
that's
vested
with
the
responsibility
of
finally
and
conclusively
deciding
that
the
certain
new
rule
is
valid,
and
it
should
be
made
retroactive.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
that
wouldn't.
i
think
the
fairest
reading
of
the
statute
is
congress
made
a
considered
decision
that
there
have
been
difficulties
in
the
lower
courts
with
understanding
what
is
retroactive
and
what
is
not
retroactive,
and
that
you
could
never
be
sure,
finally
and
conclusively,
that
a
particular
rule
was
retroactive
until
this
court
had
said
that
it
was.
and
that
someone
who
is
on
second
and
successive
habeas,
who
has
had
direct
review
and
first
habeas
already,
that
person
is
in
jail
validly
and
pursuant
to
his
conviction,
and
if
this
court
gets
around
to
saying
that,
then
the
person
may
be--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
so.
yes,
i
think
that
that's
what
congress
provided,
and
i
think
they
provided
it
for
a
good
reason.
as
i
said
in
response
to
justice
kennedy,
if
the
court
wanted
to
distinguish
unmistakable
import
cases,
i
would
think
those
would
only
arise
under
the
first
teague
exception,
and
i
also
think
that
not
all
cases
under
the
first
teague
exception
would
qualify
or
be
even
close.
i
mean,
petitioner
in
this
case...
i
think
in
their
brief
they
have
about
five
examples.
i
would
agree
with
one
or
maybe
two
of
them,
but
not
with
the
other
three,
and
i
think
there
would
be
a
lot
to
argue
about.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
on
a
first
habeas
in
a
case
like
this
whereas
a
kind
of,
whereas
a
kind
of--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--on
an
original
petition--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yeah,
i
would
go
maybe
just
an
inch
beyond
holding,
which
is
either
a
holding
or
a
statement
that's
not
dicta.
that
is,
a
statement
that's
necessary
to
the
conclusion
in
the
case.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i'm
not
sure
that
could
not
be
the
holding.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
it
can
be
part
of
the
reasoning
in
the
case
but
if
it
was
the
necessary
reasoning.
it
is
very
hard
for
me
to--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
i...
i
just
don't
think
that
we
can
fairly
say
that
it's
this
court
that's
made
the
specific
new
rule
that
the
habeas
petitioner
is
relying
on,
that
it's
this
court
that's
made
it
retroactive
when
it's
just
a
statement
in
an
opinion
which
the
lower
courts
have
to
pay
attention
to,
but
those
statements
don't
themselves
have
legal
force
and
effect
like
the
holding
of
a
case
or
perhaps
a
statement
that
was
necessary
to
the
reasoning
and
therefore
not
dicta.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
think
it
would.
first
of
all,
i
think
the
statute
of
limitations
provision
hasn't
been
construed,
as
far
as
i
know,
that
particular
provision
of
it,
by
any
lower
court,
and
the
meaning
of
whether
it
would
run
from
the
date
of
the
original
decision
or
the
date
that
this
court
had
made
the
decision
retroactive
i
think
is
not
entirely
clear,
so
i
don't
think
it
would
necessarily
be
a
problem.
but
i
also
do
think
that
congress
intended
that
the
gateway
for
second
and
successive
habeas
petitioners
should
be
extremely
narrow,
and
they
assigned,
congress
assigned,
the
courts
of
appeals
the
responsibility
within
a
thirty
day
period
of
deciding...
usually
they're
based
just
on
the
petition,
not
on
any
response
from
the
other
party,
from
the
warden...
based
just
on
the
petition
a
determination
of
whether
it
satisfies
the
teague
exception
or
not.
if
they
can
look
at
the
decisions
of
this
court,
that
part
of
it
won't
be
hard
to
do.
they
might
have
difficulty
figuring
out
just
what
the
claim
is,
but
they
won't
have
difficulty
figuring
out
whether
it's
retroactive.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
in
our...
that's
correct,
and
this
statute,
of
course,
didn't
apply
then,
but
a
second
or
successive
habeas
petitioner
would
have
had
to
wait
until
there
was
a
decision
of
this
court
that
finally
and...
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
that
it
be
finally
and
conclusively
decided,
both
the
validity
of
the
rule
the
petitioner
is
relying
on
and
its
retroactivity,
before
they're
going
to
get
into
court.
congress
did
not
intend
that
people
should
be
able
to
bring
second
or
successive
habeases
so
that
they
can
establish
whether
it's
retroactive
or
not.
and
as
shown
in
this
case...
the
petitioner
in
this
case
claims
that
it
was
totally
clear
after
sullivan
that
the
rule
in
cage
should
be
made
retroactive,
but
i
think
we've
at
least
made
substantial
arguments
it's
not,
and
it's
going
to
be...
there
are
going
to
be
issues
raised
in
these
cases,
and
i
think
the
congress
wanted
this
court--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
that
the
court
could,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
court
should,
make
it
retroactive.
i
think
the
key
distinction--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
i
think
the
key
distinction
that
the
court
should
keep
in
mind
is
between
the
refinement
and
the
application
of
rules
that
are
bedrock
which
i
think
is
what
cage
did,
and
i
think
a
comparison
the
cage
decision
with
the
decision
in
victor
v.
nebraska
shows
that
that
was
a
refinement
of
just
precisely
what
the
reasonable
doubt
instruction
means--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes,
i
do.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
the
court
could
do
it
because
the
question
would
really
come
down
to
whether
the
word
made
retroactive
had
a
temporal
component,
that
is,
it
had
to
have
been
done
at
the
time
he
filed
the
petition,
or
whether
it
could
be
done
some
time
later
in
the
litigation.
and
it's
our
view
that
it
doesn't
necessarily
have
that
temporal
component.
if
you
thought
that
it
did
have
that
temporal
component,
then
you
would
stop
after
the
first
question.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
think
that
that's
correct,
because
it's
true
that
that's
what
they
should
have
done,
but
the
consequences
of
them
not
doing
that
are
that
there
are
two
questions
that
are
presented
to
this
court
in
this
case,
and
the
court
in
other
cases...
again,
the
court
could
just
reach
a--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
clearly
incorrect
because
this
court
had
not
made
cage
retroactive
and,
in
our
view,
should
not
make
cage
retroactive.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that
is
sometimes
what
happens,
for
example,
when
this
court
overrules
its
own
decision
in
a
past
case,
where
the
lower
court
did
not
have
the
authority
to
do
that
but
might
have
nonetheless--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
that
would
be
also...
the
court
could...
the
court
could
do
that.
i
think
the
court
has
discretion
as
to...
i
was
only
saying
that
i
thought
the
court
could
reach
the
other
question
if
it
chose
to.
with
respect
to
the
retroactivity
of
cage,
the
point
of
the
rule
in
teague
was
that
good
faith
reasonable
explications
of
rules
of
constitutional
law...
even
bedrock
rules
and
very
important
rules
of
constitutional
law
should
be
validated
and
should
not
form
the
basis
for
later
habeas
review.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
thank
you.
