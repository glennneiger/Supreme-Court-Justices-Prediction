and
i'm
charged
with
having
embezzled
on

unknown
speaker
--just
not
sure.
unknown
speaker
--i
suppose,
mr.
greenwood,
that
your
response
to
the
contention
that
it
ought
to
be
enough
that
his
lawyer
tells
him
at
the
very
beginning,
look
it,
i'm
only
representing
you
on
this
crime,
but
you
shouldn't
talk
to
them
about
any
other
crime,
you
got
that?
unknown
speaker
maybe...
well,
this
is
just
to
clarify
something
that
i
had
trouble
understanding.
