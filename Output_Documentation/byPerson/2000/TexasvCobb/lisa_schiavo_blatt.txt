ms.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
police
have
a
compelling
interest
in
investigating
uncharged
crimes
and
in
obtaining
voluntary
confessions
from
suspects
who
have
been
advised
of
their
right
to
counsel
under
miranda
and
are
willing
to
speak
to
the
police
about
those
uncharged
crimes.
that
questioning
does
not
violate
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
because
that
right
is
offense
specific.
under
that
rule,
the
statements
may
not
be
used
to
prove
the
charged
offense,
but
the
statements
are
admissible
in
a
trial
for
the
uncharged
offenses.
it
does
not
matter,
under
this
rule,
whether
the
two
crimes
are
factually
related.
the
test
is
rather
whether
the
two
crimes
constitute
the
same
offense.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
because
the
sixth
amendment,
the
text
of
the
sixth
amendment
only
applies
to
someone
who
has
been
accused
in
a
pending
prosecution,
and
the
prosecution
is
limited
by
the
actual
offenses
that
are
charged
by
the
state,
and
it
is
only
at
that
time
that
the
right
to
counsel
attaches
under
the
sixth
amendment.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no.
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
the
requirement
that
there
must
be
a
shift
from
investigation
to
accusation
is
more
than
just
a
formalism,
because
the
purpose
and
the
essence
of
the
sixth
amendment
is
to
make
sure
the
defendant
has
an
opportunity
to
consult
with
counsel
and
prepare
for
a
defense
against
the
pending
charges.
a
suspect
has
no
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
to
have
a
lawyer
appointed
or
assist
him
in
connection
with
charges
that
have
not
been
brought
by
the
state,
that
may
never
be
brought
by
the
state.
the
suspect
has
never
indicated
any
unwillingness
to
talk
to
the
police
about
those
uncharged
offenses.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
the
same
elements
test
under
blockburger
leads
to
consistent
and
predictable
results,
and
can
be
ascertained
ahead
of
time
by
the
police
officer,
and
if
he
needs
to
consult
with
the
prosecutor,
he
can
do
that.
by
contrast,
pegging
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
transaction
test
leaves
police
officers
in
the
untenable
position
of
not
knowing
before
they
question
the
suspect
what--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--he
may
not
know
that.
it
may
be
that
they
know
that
there's
been
a
burglary
and
that
there
are
missing
bodies,
but
have
no
idea
whether
those
victims
were
murdered
by
someone
else
2
weeks
from
then,
whether
there
had
been
a
kidnapping,
whether
it
was
in
a
different
location.
i
mean,
he
can't
possibly
know
ahead
of
time,
without
talking
to
the
suspect,
nor
can
a
court
ask
at
the
time
of
appointment
of
counsel,
would
you
mind
telling
me
everything
you
did
as
part
of
the
same
transaction
so
i
can
make
sure
you're
appointed
counsel
with
respect
to
all
possible
offenses
that
may
be
brought
against
you.
they
just...
they
don't
know
that.
they're
in
a
phase
of
investigation,
and
this
case
is
a
perfect
illustration
of
that.
there's
no
contention
in
this
case
the
state
manipulated
the
charges
when
they
indicted
him
for
burglary
and
15
months
later
questioned
him
about
the
murder,
nor
is
there
any
suggestion
that
they
had
enough
proof
at
the
time
that
they
charged
him
with
burglary
to
charge
him
with
murder,
and
there's
a
hypothetical
assertion
that
there
might
be
incentives
for
selective
manipulation,
but
we
don't
believe
that
those
incentives
necessarily
exist.
once
the
state
initiates
a
prosecution,
the
suspect
will
not
only
be
afforded
the
right
to
counsel,
but
at
the
time
that
he's
approached,
if
he's
in
custody,
he
will
be
given
his
fifth
amendment
miranda
warnings
and,
under
this
court's
decision
in--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--i
think
to
the
extent
that
the...
yes,
and
to
the
extent
that
the
defense
relates
to
the
pending
charge.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
if
he
said
to
his
lawyer,
i
also
murdered
these
two
people,
i
think
it
would
be
perfectly
clear
that
the...
if
the
defendant
went
off
and
started
researching
capital
sentencing
procedures
under
texas
law
he
very
well
might
not
get
paid
for
that.
he
was
appointed
to
represent
his
client
on
the
burglary
charge.
he
certainly
can
take
on
a
scope
of
representation
that's
greater
than
that,
and
can
work
out
an
arrangement
with
his
client
to
get
paid
for
that.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no,
he
certainly
will
want
to
talk
to
his
client
with
respect
to
the
conduct
that
constituted
the
offense
for
which
he's
been
charged,
and
there
might
be
other
things
he
needs
to
know
about.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
he
will
need
to
spend
whatever
time
is
necessary
to
defend
him
on
the
pending
charge,
but
he's
certainly
free
to
tell
his
client,
i'm
not
competent
to
represent
you
in
a
death
penalty
case
and
you
ought
to
retain
separate
counsel
for
that
offense,
and
moreover,
you
haven't
even
been
charged
with
that
offense.
in
all
these
cases
where
there
is
a
pending
charge,
the
court
in
mcneil
and
in
moulton
represented...
excuse
me,
recognized
the
compelling
interest
that
the
police
have
in
investigating
and
solving
uncharged
offenses,
and
if
the
suspect
never
indicates
any
unwillingness
to
talk
to
the
police
about
those
offenses,
there's
no
basis
for
excluding
what
is
concededly
a
voluntary
confession
to
those
crimes
that
might
otherwise
go
unsolved.
the
other
thing
i
wanted
to
say,
just
about
the
blockburger
test,
is
that
this
court,
in
the
context
of
double
jeopardy
and
the
lesser
included
offenses
context,
has
recognized
that
that
test
is
workable,
and
is
predictable,
and
can
lead
to
consistent
results.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i
think
the
police
officer
can
certainly
ascertain
immediately
what
the
pending
charge
was
against
the
suspect,
and
if
he
has
any
questions
about
the
elements
test
he
can
certainly
ask
a
prosecutor,
but
generally
the
police
can
be
advised,
as
this
court
recognized
in
moulton,
that
it's
okay
to
approach
a
suspect
that's
under
indictment
about
additional
crimes,
and
so
the
question
just
simply
becomes,
what's
a
separate
offense,
and
that's
a
lot
easier
question
than,
is
it
possible
that
the
suspect
may
say
something
that's
so...
a
court
may
or
may
not
later
deem
inextricably
intertwined,
such
that
the
statements
can't
be
used.
if
there
are
no
other
questions--
