mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
asking
only
that
this
court
follow
its
prior
precedents
in
brewer
and
maine
v.
moulton.
we
don't
want
to
expand
any
constitutional
application.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
your
honor,
in
looking
at
the
court's,
initially
the
fifth
amendment
cases
on
the
right
of
counsel
and
then
the
stair
stepping
and
the
filling
in
of
the
blanks
of
the
various
phases
where
counsel
has
come
in,
as
we've
all
had
to
do
in
the
research
for
these
cases,
and
we
get
to
mcneil...
and
we
have
no
problem
with
mcneil.
mcneil
makes
sense
in
the
context
in
which
it
was
written.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
your
honor,
in--
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
--your
honor,
i
can...
under...
in
the
context
of
the
way,
the
facts
of
mcneil,
i
can
see
that
statement
being
legitimately
and
perfectly
reasonable,
but
mcneil--
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
--yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
no,
your
honor.
that
statement,
taken
in
separation
with
the
facts
of
mcneil
and
the
issues
presented
i
think
are
really
different,
and
i
recognize...
we've
reviewed
you
all's
decisions,
concurring
and
dissenting
opinions
here,
and
we
understand
you
all's
concerns
about
that,
but
in
our
view,
in
starting
with
mcneil,
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
the
question
before
them
was
unrelated
offenses,
and
this
court
granted
cert
on
unrelated
offenses,
and
during
the
argument
of
counsel
the
government
on
at
least
three
separate
occasions
in
mcneil,
and
we've
got
their
transcripts,
said
this
is...
the
situation
here
is
completely
separate
and
distinct
offenses,
different
counties,
different
victims,
different
facts.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
that's
true,
your
honor,
and...
but
it
just,
from
our
viewpoint,
even
though
mcneil
makes
sense
as
to
separate
and
distinct
offenses,
when
you
look
at
brewer,
and
moulton,
and
the
interrelated,
intertwined
defenses,
to
us
you
just
simply
cannot
say,
well,
the
line
of
brewer
just
stopped,
because--
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
--in
looking
at
all
of
these
things
and
trying
to
make
a
decision,
the
simplest
and
easiest
definition
we
got
to
is
just
the
related
offenses,
where
those
that
occur
in
one
single
immediate
transaction
and
incident.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
okay.
well,
transaction
is
defined...
is
not
even
defined
under
texas
joinder
law,
so
you
get
a
dictionary
out,
but
at
the
same
immediate
temporal
time
and
place.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
yes,
sir.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
absolutely.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
initially,
your
honor,
one
of
the
concerns
that
i
have
is,
as
the
chief
justice
wrote
in
one
of
his
dissenting
opinions,
i
think
in
moulton,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
that
there
has
not
been
in
the
past
wholesale
violation
of
sixth
amendment
problems
by
law
enforcement.
i
think
to
allow...
but
over
the
years
in
this,
these
more
than
two
decades
of
cases
that
dealt
with
this
related
offense
concept
have
generally
kept
the
police
away
from
the
defendant
in
these
related
contacts,
so
you
haven't
had
wholesale--
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
--the
immediate,
most
immediate
concern
i
have
is
that
a
statement
by
this
court
that
that
is
permissible
will
encourage
police
officers
to
make
those
contacts.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
absolutely.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
because
the...
and
i
must
preface
this
just
briefly.
this
can
be
a
complicated
situation,
with
regard
to
sixth
amendment
and
the
related
offenses,
and
that's
why
most
of
the
courts
of
appeals,
fifth
circuit
and
third
circuit,
have
devised
a
list
of
factors,
totality
of
the
circumstances,
which
we
think
are
necessary.
having
said
that,
in
this
case,
for
example,
you
have
a
long
term,
17
months
or
more,
attorney
client
relationship.
counsel
has
been
dealing
with
the
courts,
actively
filing
motions.
he
has
been
dealing
with
the
district
attorney,
theoretically,
with
law
enforcement
concerning
this
immediate
burglary,
but
everybody
knows
there's
these
other
potential
crimes
out
there.
they're
still
investigating
them.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
right.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
yes,
sir.
thank
you
for
filling
in
the--
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
--your
honor,
in
dealing
with
all
this,
we
have
looked
at
the
term
transaction,
because
that's
a
series
of
acts
of
conduct
which
can
have
one
offense
or
dozens.
the
term
crimes
means
different
things
in
this
context.
the
term--
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
--offenses
does,
and
i
don't
want
to
get
into
a
semantic
battle
with
you
all.
you
all
are
the
experts
in
that,
and
need
to
write
this
thing.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
right.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
your
honor,
i
agree
with
that,
but
since--
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
--since
mcneil,
it
does
make
a
difference,
and--
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
--well,
and
that's
part--
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
--in
the
decisions
of
the
courts
of
appeals
on
this
issue
dealing
with
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
one
of
the
important
things
in
making
sure
that
the
concerns
of
the
court
with
regard
to
really
hamstringing
law
enforcement
are
not
overdone,
is
limiting
it
to
a
single
criminal
investigation
in
a
jurisdiction
by
the
same
type
of
law
enforcement,
and
we'll
go
along
with
that,
because
we
can
think
of
hypotheticals--
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
--no,
i
understand.
[laughter]
we
will
take
that,
your
honor,
as
to
a
limitation.
there
are
limitations
on
this.
mcneil,
obviously,
koolman
v.
wilson.
we
concede
in
our
brief
that
ongoing
and
future
crimes
should
be
exempted
from
this
related
offense
rule.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
absolutely.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
right.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
and
we
are
afraid
that
if
the
court
follows
the
petitioner's
argument
that,
because
of
the
ability
of
law
enforcement
and
prosecutors
to
charge
in
a
matter
of
discretion
at
their
will,
they
can,
in
fact
pick
different
crimes
and
then
make
dozens
of
confrontations
with
the
defendant.
for
example,
in
this
case--
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
--right.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
i...
in
the
brief
before
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
we
followed
the
third
and
fifth
circuits'
totality
of
circumstances
test,
and
followed
it
right
down
the
line
with
regard
to
that.
any
one
of
those
factors
could
have
totally
thrown
off
the
analysis
of
this
case.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
that
is
true,
and
in
our
attempt
at
definition
to
limit
expansion
of
this
concept
any
longer,
is
the
transaction
or
incident
in
a
temporal
time
and
place
seems
to
be
the
least
expansive
you
can
get,
and
most
police
officers--
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
--i
don't
think
under
the
facts
you
could
have
gotten
there,
but
assuming
that--
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
--you
would
have...
if
you
had
something
like
that,
you
would
have
two
separate
crimes--
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
--really,
as
opposed
to
the
same
transaction.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
oh,
well,
thought,
but
you
see,
if
the
facts
show
otherwise,
then
you
have
a
set
of
facts
that
can
be
analyzed.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
i
may
have
missed
some
of
that,
your
honor,
but
law
enforcement
officers
deal
with
transactions
and
incidents
daily--
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
--and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
would
be
the
easiest
definition.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
i
will
concede
that
at
the
time
what
he
legitimately
believes.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
yes.
that
makes
sense,
under...
in
considering
all
this,
because
you
could
have
a
bizarre
circumstance
when
no
one
would
know
when
certain
crimes
occurred.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
in--
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
--a
police
officer
in
a...
i
cannot
answer
the
question.
that...
i
do
not
think
of
that
concept--
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
--but...
but,
if
i
knew
a
police
officer
who
had
no
knowledge
or
intent,
really...
i'm
trying
to
separate
it
from
this
case.
that's
my
difficulty...
had
really
no
knowledge
that
an
investigation
was
going
on
and
that
we
want
to
interrogate
him
about
this
serious
crime,
then
i
could
see
a
judge
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
saying,
there's
no
either
bad
faith
or
negligence
or
intentional
or
even
accidental
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment.
i
haven't
been
able
to
work
out
your
factual
question
far
enough
down
the
line,
sorry.
but
i
do
believe...
in
this
case,
for
example,
in
the
texas
statutory
scheme,
this
defendant
could
have
been
charged,
well,
with
nine
different
capital
crimes,
and
three
of
them,
at
least
three
of
them
are
under
statutorily
different
offenses
which
would
have
allowed
prosecution
under
blockburger,
even
though
it's
the
same
offenses,
same
exact
conduct,
and
where...
we
are
concerned
that
under
a
circumstance
where
an
attorney
has
been
representing
a
defendant
for
a
substantial
length
of
time,
and
he
consults
and
investigates
on
this
limited,
immediate
transaction
about
various
crimes,
and
he
tells,
and
he
consults
the
attorney
about
what
we're
going
to
do...
for
example,
in
the
example
it
was
asked
if
he
was
arrested
on
one
offense,
he
said,
by
the
way,
i
killed
two
other
people.
well,
i
know
what
i
would
do
if
i
was
his
counsel,
and
take
all
possible
avenues
to
try
to
protect
him
under
my
responsibility.
i
give
a
lot
of
credence
in
this
whole
issue
here
with
the
responsibility
of
the
scope
of
counsel.
in
the
mcneil
argument
one
of
the
attorney--
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
--that,
of
course,
is
what
their
position
is,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
--we
believe
that
if
the
court
allows
this
continuous
conduct
where
law
enforcement
can
come
in
on
a
regular
basis,
in
this
case,
literally
dozens
of
times
could
have
come
back
at
mr.
cobb
to
interrogate
him
about
all
the
potential
offenses,
that
it
gives
certain
rise
to
complete
abuse.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
and
we
say
they...
once
he
has
counsel,
in
these
facts
they
know
he
has
counsel,
they
ought
to
stay
away
from
him.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
they
didn't
know.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
i
still
maintain
that
as
long
as
that
formal
charge
was
pending,
and
the
counsel
relationship
continued,
that
when
you
throw
law
enforcement
into
talking
to
the
defendant
without
his
counsel,
that
you're
still
subjecting
the
defendant
to
abuses
because,
primarily,
of
the
moran
v.
burbine
decision
that
allows
police
officers
to
lie
to
the
defendants,
and
you're
getting
a
conflict,
more
than
likely,
which
will
encourage
a
conflict
of
statements
between
what
the
lawyer's
telling
him
and
what
the
police
officers
are
telling
him.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
right.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
no,
your
honor.
we
still
maintain
that
jackson
is
a
proper
continuation
of
sixth
amendment
jurisprudence.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
we
just
believe
that
if
you
rely
on
this,
the
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment
on
these
related
offenses,
you're
going
to
have
officers,
encourage
them
to
make
more
and
more
contact
with
the
defendant
and
invade
that
attorney
client
relationship
with
false
information,
which
i
think
will
lead
to
more
abuses.
that's
all
the
questions?
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
yes.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
i
think
they
could,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
e.
greenwood
thank
you,
your
honor.
