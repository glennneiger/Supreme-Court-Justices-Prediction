justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that...
that
isn't
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--as
i
understand
it,
that
isn't
the
advice
that
he
gave
him.
he...
there's
no
indication
that
i
know
of
that
he
gave
him
any
advice
that
he
should
not
talk
to
the
police
about
anything
else.
he
in
fact
said
to
the
police
sure,
go
ahead
and
talk
with
him
about
the
murder.
justice
david
h.
souter
is...
just
as
a
matter
of
fact,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
coleman,
as
i
understand
your
argument
on
why
the
permissibility
of
this
kind
of
interrogation
for
related
offenses
is
not
likely
to
cut
back,
in
effect,
on
the
sixth
amendment
right
which
has
attached,
your
best
argument
seems
to
be
that
you
don't
have
to
recognize
a
sixth
amendment
right
here
because
there's
going
to
be,
as
there
was
in
this
case,
an
adequate
warning
that
one
doesn't
have
to
speak,
and
an
adequate
fifth
amendment
opportunity
to
get
a
lawyer,
probably
the
same
one,
but
in
any
case
to
get
a
lawyer
prior
to
the
commencement
or
continuation
of
any
interrogation.
do
you
agree
that's
probably
your
strongest
response
to
the
concerns
expressed
by
people
like
justice
breyer?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
sorry.
what
about,
then,
the
concern
for
noncustodial
interrogations?
if
the
person
who
has
been
charged
with
the
first
offense
is
out
on
bail,
and
the
police
want
to
go
and
interrogate,
simply
see
if
they
can
strike
up
a
conversation
with
a
guy
at
his
apartment,
we're
not
going
to
get...
i
presume
we're
not
going
to
get
into
any
miranda
rights.
isn't
the
opportunity
for
abuse
there,
so
that
on
your
best
argument,
if
the
police
are
subtle
about
what
they
do,
and
they
have
a
defendant
who's
not
in
custody,
they
will,
in
fact,
raise
the,
i
think
the
specter
of
cutting
back
on
the
sixth
amendment
right
with
respect
to
the
crime
that
has
already
been
charged.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
there
would
be
an
exclusion
if
anything
were
said
about
that
offense?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
would
be
enforceable
by
the
exclusionary
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
greenwood,
i
think
your,
sort
of
your
strongest
argument
is
that,
if
you
don't
recognize
the
scope
of
the
right
as
you
argue
for
it,
that
the
risk
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
in
the...
with
respect
to
the
first
offense
will
be
infringed
is
simply
too
great,
and
you
cannot
run
that
risk,
and
this
is
the
way
to
avoid
it.
mr.
coleman
has
essentially
two
responses
to
that,
and
i'd
like
you
to
comment
on
them.
the
first
response
is
that
if
the
subsequent
interrogation
is
a
custodial
one,
the
miranda
warnings
are
going
to
be
there,
and
they
functionally
will
assuage
your
concern
and
that
in
any
event,
even
in
a
noncustodial
case
and,
a
fortiori,
in
the
custodial
case,
if,
in
fact,
there
is
a
violation
of
sixth
amendment
right
with
respect
to
the
first
offense,
any
evidence
so
given
will
be
excluded
with
respect
to
the
first
offense.
and
he
in
effect
says,
these
two
avenues
of
warning
or
relief
are
sufficient
to
reduce
the
concern
about
the
risk
that
you
raise.
how
do
you
respond?
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
but
let's
assume
we
no
longer
have
that
regime,
but
we
have
the
regime
that
your
brother
argues
for
and
he
says
the
two
safeguards
are
miranda
in
custodial
cases,
exclusion
in
noncustodial
cases
if
the
interrogation
strays
into
the
evidence
on
the
first
offense.
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
that
it
does.
let's
assume
that
no,
this
relatedness
test
is
not
the
proper
test,
there's
going
to
be
more
interrogation.
justice
david
h.
souter
we're
all
assuming
that.
now,
why
are
his
two
safeguards
going
to
be
insufficient?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
implied
by
what
you
were
just
saying?
i
mean,
any
prudent
lawyer
is
going
to
say
to
his
client,
don't
talk
to
them
about
anything,
no
matter
what,
unless
i'm
there,
and
why
isn't
that
one
of
the
answers
to
the
concerns
that
you're
raising?
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
i
suppose
the
same
answer
that
justice
scalia
just
outlined
for
you
is
your
answer
to
the
question
that
i
raised
earlier
about
your
brother's
argument.
if
miranda
is
good
enough
to
protect
him
here,
why
wasn't
miranda
good
enough
to
protect
him
then?
