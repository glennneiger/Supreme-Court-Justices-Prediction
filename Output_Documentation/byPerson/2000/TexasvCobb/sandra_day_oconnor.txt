justice
sandra

o'connor
well,
a
number
of
courts
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
where
the
two
crimes
arise
out
of
the
same
conduct
and
are
closely
related,
that
you're
going
to
go
ahead
and
apply
the
sixth
amendment
requirement
to
the
related
but
yet
uncharged
crime.
is
that
the
majority
view
of
lower
courts
today?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
we've
said
in
mcneil
that
it's
offense
specific--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--this
sixth
amendment
right,
and
here
there
was
at
the
time
of
the
burglary
charge
no
evidence
of
the
murder...
the
murders,
or
the
defendant's
connection
with
them,
so
why
isn't
that
a
separate
offense?
