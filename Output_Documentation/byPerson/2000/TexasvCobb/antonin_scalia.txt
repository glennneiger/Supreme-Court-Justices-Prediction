justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
coleman,
would
it
make
any
difference
to
you
if
the
other
crime
about
which
he's
being
interrogated
is
not
only
factually
related
but,
under
the
blockburger
test,
would
be
a
greater
offense
of
which
the
offense
on
which
he's
indicted
is
a
lesser
included
offense?
that
is
to
say,
he
has
an
attorney
on
a
burglary
charge,
and
he's
interrogated
concerning
the
offense
of
murder
in
the
course
of
burglary.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
not
quite
the
same
crime,
but
if
he
got
acquitted
on
the
burglary
he'd
have
to
be
acquitted
on
murder
in
the
course
of
burglary.
i
mean,
blockburger
would
cover
it
and
it
would
be
double
jeopardy.
so
in
that
case
you'd
say
he
could
not
be
interrogated
without
consulting
his
lawyer
concerning
murder
in
the
course
of
burglary?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
take
it,
mr.
greenwood.
take
it.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
what
we
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
get
back
to
your
description
of
what
was
going
on
here?
the
man
had
a
lawyer,
the
police
had
dealt
with
him
over
many
cases.
what
i
can't
understand
about
your
case,
or
about
the
rule
that
you're
urging
upon
us,
is
why
it
makes
a
difference
that
the
other
offense
was
factually
related,
was
simultaneous.
i
mean,
i
can
understand
the
position
that,
look,
once
a
man
has
a
lawyer...
i
have
a
lawyer
for
embezzlement.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
charged
with
an
entirely
separate
embezzlement...
or,
i'm
interrogated
about
an
entirely
separate
embezzlement
on
may
14th.
i
would
feel
just
as
strongly
as
you
do
about,
well,
it's
only
fair
they
know
the
man
has
a
lawyer,
they
shouldn't
go
to
him
without
going
to
his
lawyer.
they
know
the
man
has
a
lawyer
to
represent
him
vis
a
vis
the
police.
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
it's
factually
related
or
not,
if
you're
going
to
appeal
to
that,
i
don't
know,
that
feeling
once
you
know
a
guy
has
a
lawyer,
you
ought
to
deal
with
his
lawyer?
i
don't
see
that
the
factual
relationship
makes
me
feel
any
worse
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
think
unless
we're
going
to
go
all
the
way
down
to
the
bottom
of
that
slippery
slope
it
makes
sense
to
say
what
you
have
a
lawyer
for
is
for
the
charge,
and
that
the
choice
is
between
saying
you
have
a
lawyer
for
that
charge,
and
the
police
can
deal
with
you
separately
on
any
matter
that
is
apart
from
that
charge,
and
if
you're
not
going
to
adopt
that
rule
you
really
ought
to
jump
all
the
way
over
to
the
rule
that
once
you're
represented
by
a
lawyer
with
regard
to
this
police
department,
with
regard
to
matters
that...
concerning
this
defendant,
they
ought
to
contact
that
lawyer
for
everything
they
have
to
do
with
that
defendant.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
a
big
extension
of
what
we've
said
up
to
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
the
problem
that
the
law
enforcement
has
is
not
only
that
they
don't
know
how
to
define
what
is
a
related
offense,
but
that
they
also
don't
know
whether
the
offense
that
they're
inquiring
about
meets
that
definition
or
not.
that
is
a
totally
separate
second
problem
which
existed
here.
they
did
not
know
whether
the
kidnapping
was
done
at
the
same
time
as
the
murder,
whether
the
two
were
related
or
not.
it's
a
real
problem,
not
just
figuring
out
a
definition,
but
also
figuring
out
whether
what
they're
asking
about
falls
within
that
definition
or
not.
they
won't
know
that
until
the
facts
are
fully
known.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
the
police
here
thought
that
the
kidnapping
had
occurred
on
a
different
day
from
the
burglary,
that
he
had
done
the
kidnapping
and
the
murder
and
then
he'd
gone
back
the
next
day
and
burglarized
the
place?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
enough
that
they
thought
that
and
it
turns
out
not
to
be
the
case,
they're
nonetheless
not
violating
the
sixth
amendment
rights?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
it
didn't
turn
out
that
way.
it
turned
out
that
they
were
both
done
on
the
same
day.
now,
but
you're
going
to
let
the
police
off
because
they
thought
it
was
on
separate
days,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
they
can't
talk
at
all
then,
because
even
though
they
think
it
happened
on
a
separate
day
and
therefore,
believing
they're
in
full
compliance
with
the
sixth
amendment
they
interrogate
the
person
without
his
lawyer,
it
turns
out
that
they
happened
on
the
same
day,
and
all
this
evidence
has
to
be
thrown
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
suggesting
that
what
matters
is
the
reality,
or
what
matters
is
what
the
interrogator
believes
when
he
conducts
the
interrogation?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
does
he
have
to
know
that
it
was
at
the
same
time,
or
suppose
he's
in
a
state
of
complete
agnosticism.
he
doesn't
know
when
it
occurred.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
he
violating
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can't,
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
don't
talk
to
them
at
all.
yes,
yes,
i
understand.
the
argument
that
that
suffices,
what's
wrong
with
that
is
that
if
it
suffices
here
it
would
have
sufficed
or
ought
to
have
sufficed
in
michigan
v.
jackson
as
well.
i
mean,
doesn't
michigan
v.
jackson
assume
that
that's
not
enough?
the
lawyer's
going
to
tell
him,
look
it,
i'm
your
lawyer
now,
don't
talk
to
the
police
without
me,
and
yet
michigan
v.
jackson
still
says,
even
though
the
lawyer's
told
him
that,
if
the
police
try
to
talk
to
him
without
him,
it's
a
constitutional
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
maybe
michigan
v.
jackson
is
wrong.
i
mean,
if--
