mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
raymond
cobb
confessed
to
murdering
maggie
and
korie
rae
owens,
he
was
more
than
once
meticulously
informed
of
his
right
to
counsel
and
the
consequences
of
his
choice
to
waive
that
right.
his
confession
was
properly
admitted
at
trial
and
should
not
have
been
rejected
under
jackson,
because
cobb's
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
had
never
attached
to
the
murders
and
therefore
did
not
need
to
be
waived,
or,
alternatively,
because
cobb
validly
waived
whatever
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
had
attached.
applying
mcneil's
rule
of
offense
specificity
to
exclude
factually
related
but
uncharged
crimes
from
the
scope
of
sixth
amendment
attachment
is
true
to
and,
we
think,
required
by
both
the
text
and
the
purposes
of
the
sixth
amendment.
in
evaluating
attachment,
the
court
is
interpreting
the
sixth
amendment
terms,
criminal
prosecutions
and
the
accused,
and
for
decades
this
court
has
consistently
interpreted
that
text
to
limit
attachment
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
to
the
formal
initiation
of
judicial
criminal
proceedings.
indeed,
setting
aside
escobido--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--the
fact
that
the
interrogation
occurred
in
odessa
makes
no
difference,
you're
exactly
right.
if
ridley
had
been
appointed
on
the
burglary
and
had
not
yet
been
appointed
on
the
murders
because
there
had
been
no
indictment,
the
police
were
free
to
interrogate
mr.
cobb.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
that
is
correct.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
that's
correct.
i
don't
think
that
they
were
obligated
to
do
it.
i
don't
think
that
they
called.
i
think
the
record
indicated
that,
in
fact,
he
was
in
court
with
ridley
when
they
asked
if
they
could
talk,
and
so
he
was
there.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
yes.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
don't
know
if
it
would
be
a
responsible
thing
to
do,
but
the
court
made
clear
in
davis
that
until
there's
been
an
initiation
of
criminal
proceedings
the
sixth
amendment
constitutional
right
to
counsel
doesn't
attach,
so
it
would
be
poor
practice,
perhaps
malpractice,
but
not
a
sixth
amendment
violation.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
don't
think
that
courts
have
established
any
kind
of
consistent
test,
but
yes,
most
of
the
courts
that
have
addressed
this
issue
have
said
there
is
this
test,
although
most
of
them
have
found
that
there
is,
in
fact,
no
violation.
it's
a
relatively
small
number
that
have
found
a
violation.
but
we
would
go
back
and
say
that
they're
erroneous
in
applying
that
test
at
all,
and
as
i
was
saying,
escobido
aside,
this
court
has
never,
ever
held
that
the
sixth
amendment
attached
prior
to
the
initiation
of
formal
judicial
proceedings,
prior
to
indictment
or
arraignment.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
under
moran
that
might
be
constitutionally
permissible,
but
remember,
the
important
aspect
of
the
analysis
is
what
happens
in
the
room,
because
the
defendant
does
have
a
fifth
amendment
right
to
counsel
that
he
needs
to
be
informed
about,
and
he
has
an
opportunity
to
waive
that,
so
that
would
only
happen
if
the
defendant
or
suspect
has
actually
waived
his
fifth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i'm
actually
very
anxious,
justice
kennedy,
to
debunk
this
idea
of
abuse
or
manipulation,
because
when
the
police
are
doing
an
investigation,
and
they
might
be
investigating
a
number
of
related
crimes,
once
they
have
enough
evidence
to
convict,
admissible
evidence
to
convict
on
one
of
them,
there's
certainly
no
problem
with
them
bringing
that
charge.
they
have
a
serious
societal
interest
in
continuing
to
investigate
other
crimes,
but
if
you
compare
that
defendant
who
has
had
one
crime
charged
against
the
defendant
where
they
haven't
brought
any
of
the
charges,
once
you
charge
that
defendant
he
has
the
right
to
counsel
that
has
now
attached
not
only
to
the
fifth
amendment
but
also
the
sixth
amendment,
and
our
system
ensures
that
that
person
will
not
only
have
a
right
to
counsel
but
will
relatively
quickly
actually
be
represented
by
counsel,
who
will
then,
of
course,
advise
the
client
as
to
the
charged
offense
and
almost
certainly
as
to
the
uncharged
offenses
and
will
say,
don't
talk
to
the
police
about
this
charged
offense
or
anything
else
and,
in
fact,
mr.
ridley
had
given
that
counsel
to
mr.
cobb.
he
simply
didn't
follow
it.
but
i
don't
think--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--there's
a
real
serious
risk
of
manipulation.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
in
september
1995--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--yes.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
on
two
occasions
he
told
the
police
to
go
ahead
and
talk
to
them.
in
september
1995,
when
cobb
was
returning
to
odessa,
ridley
said,
here's
my
card
and
my
number.
if
the
police
try
to
contact
you,
call
me.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
not
every
court,
justice
breyer.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
but
that--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
think
if
you
can
establish
trickery
then
you
create
a
fifth
amendment
issue,
because
it
is
the
fifth
amendment
and
not
the
sixth
amendment
that
goes
primarily
to
the
issue
of
coercion.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
don't
believe
that
it
is.
i
believe
that
the
police
have
a
strong
societal
interest
in
continuing
to
investigate
crimes
that
have
not
yet
been
solved,
just
as
the
police
were
trying
to
solve
two
murders
in
this
case.
they
suspected
cobb
but
they
had
no
evidence,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
constitution,
particularly
the
sixth
amendment,
prevents
the
police
from
going
back
in
and
interrogating--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
don't
believe
that
the
fact
that
there
is
a
factual
connection
between
the
crimes
makes
any
constitutional
difference,
distinction.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
mcneil
specifically
does
say
that
it's
offense
specific
and
that
should
be
interpreted,
as
i
was
arguing,
to
exclude
factually
related
crimes,
because
factually
related
crimes
are
in
no
better
position
to
receive
those
kinds
of
constitutional
protections
that
the
sixth
amendment
gives
than
are
unrelated
crimes.
this
court
has
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
sixth
amendment
is
to
protect
the
unaided
layman
at
critical
confrontations
with
his
expert
adversary,
the
government,
after
the
adverse
positions
of
the
government
and
the
defendant
have
solidified
with
respect
to
a
particular
alleged
crime.
there
are
three
parts
of
that
statement
that
this
court
has
given
in
several
cases
that
can't
be
satisfied
by
a
factually
related
crime.
certainly
the
particular
alleged
crime
doesn't
meet
it.
we
don't
think
that
there's
a
solidification
of
the
adverse
positions
with
respect
to
factually
related
crimes.
the
police
are
still
investigating
a
related
crime.
they
don't
know
if
the
defendant
did
it
or
not.
generally
speaking
they
won't
have
sufficient
evidence
to
bring
that
charge,
certainly
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
in
this
case,
and
so
there's
no
solidification,
and
there
is
not
a
critical
confrontation,
which
has
been
defined
to
be
a
critical
stage,
which
is
a
very
well
established
part
of
this
court's
sixth
amendment
jurisprudence.
there's
simply
no
critical
stage
because
it
is
pre
indictment.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
we
have
argued,
and
it
is
our
position,
that
if
it
is
not
simply
a
factually
related
crime,
but
the
argument
is
that
it
is
the
same
crime,
then
we
think
that
there's
a
strong
argument
the
sixth
amendment
would,
in
fact--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--we
would
say
that
this
court's
rule
would
prohibit
the
introduction
of
evidence
relating
to
that
interrogation.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
we
think
that
the
court
recognized
in
moulton
that
when
the
police
interrogate
suspects
they're
frequently
trying
to
get
evidence
about
any
number
of
crimes,
and
one
of
those
might
be
a
previously
charged
crime,
and
that
is
why
the
court
has
very
consistently
said
that
the
remedy
we're
going
to
impose
is
simply
that
if
you
get
evidence
as
to
a
charged
crime
for
which
the
sixth
amendment
has
attached
and
been
asserted,
then
we
will
not
allow
you
admitted
at
trial
but
if
you
have
evidence
related
to
other,
uncharged
crimes,
and
we
would
say
also
factually
related
uncharged
crimes,
then
you
may
admit
it.
so
it's
not
the
police
that
are
really
having
to
make
a
hard
determination
at
the
time
that
they
do
the
interrogation.
that
is
made
later,
when
you
try
to
introduce
the
evidence
at
trial.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
well,
clanky
is
the
only
case
we
think
in
which
there
was
actually
the
same
offense,
and
we
think
that
if
the
police
are
still
investigating,
or
they
believe--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--clanky
v.
illinois.
i'm
sorry.
it's
an
illinois
supreme
court
case
applying
the
factual
relation
test.
the
police
are
still
investigating
other
crimes
for
which
no
charge
has
been
made.
we
think
that
they
have
at
that
point...
and
that's
all
they
need
to
know.
they
can
then
interrogate
the
suspect,
give
them
their
fifth
amendment
rights,
and
do
what
they
can
to
protect
those,
and
then
if
they
end
up
getting
information
about
a
charge
that
has
been...
a
crime
that
has
been
charged
and
for
which
the
sixth
amendment
has
both
attached
and
been
asserted,
then
they
can't
use
it
at
trial,
but
they
can
use
it,
under
moulton
and
under
this
court's
precedents,
for
any
uncharged
crime,
a
crime
for
which
the
sixth
amendment
had
not
yet
attached
at
the
time
of
the
interrogation.
but
what
respondent
would
have
the
court
do
is
make
the
court,
make
the
police
apply
a
test
that
asks
the
police
to
know
ahead
of
time
if
the
crime
for
which
they
are
going
to
interrogate
the
suspect
relates
to
something
that
the
suspect
has
previously
been
charged,
or
with
respect
to
something
that
the
suspect
and
his
counsel
may
feel
that
there
is
an
attorney
client
relationship,
and
we
don't
think
that
that
can
be
the
test.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
the
fact
that
there
is
a
close
relationship
cannot
overcome
the
fact
that
that
closely
related
crime
cannot
fit
within
the
stated
purposes
of
the
sixth
amendment,
and
the
fact
that
it
would
improperly
and
unnaturally
hamstring
the
police's
legitimate
efforts
to
investigate
and
solve
a
crime
for
which
no
one
has
been
brought
to
justice.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
believe
so,
and
i
believe
that's
exactly
what
the
court
said
in
patterson
when
it
indicated--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--that
the
reason
to
have
counsel
at
a
custodial
interrogation
for
sixth
amendment
purposes
is
not
any
stronger
than
it
is
for
fifth
amendment,
and
the
fifth
amendment--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--test
protects
them.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
the
court
in
patterson
made
it
clear
that,
as
to
the
charged
offense
for
which
the
sixth
amendment
has
attached,
there
must
be
an
express
waiver,
so
that
is
why--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--if
there
was
no
valid
waiver
for
the
charged
offense.
i
think
that's
the
meaning
of
this
court's
decision
in
patterson
and
moulton.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
yes.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
if
i
may,
i'd
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i'd
like
to
very
quickly
address
justice
stevens'
question
about
the
scope
of
representation
and
real
world
fact
scenarios
that
are
uncharged,
and
i
think
in
both
of
those
instances
i
can
go
back
beyond
the
cases
of
this
court
and
say,
those
are
not
criminal
prosecutions,
and
that
person
has
not
been
accused
of
those
factually
related
crimes,
and
the
sixth
amendment
by
its
own
text
simply
does
not
apply
in
those
types
of
circumstances.
when...
and
also,
in
both
of
those
circumstances,
if
the
defendant
or
the
suspect
is
questioned
he
can
say,
at
the
advice
of
his
counsel,
i
don't
want
to
talk
to
you,
in
other
words
cuts
him
off.
