justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
it
seems
to
me
it's
not
the
question
of
when
the
lawyer
was
appointed,
but
what
is
the
scope
of
the
representation
by
the
lawyer
who
has
been
appointed.
assume
a
lawyer
is
paid
$20
an
hour
by
the
state
for
representing
a
defendant.
he's
appointed
then
to
represent
him
in
the
robbery
charge,
then
he
talks
to
the
client,
the
client
says,
there's
a
lot
of
other
stuff
i
think
you
ought
to
know
in
order
to
represent
me
well,
and
then
he
goes
and
interviews
him
at
great
length
about
all
these
things
that
happened
in
the
same
transaction,
but
they've
never
been
indicted.
would
that
lawyer
be
entitled
to
be
paid
for
the
time
he
spent
on
questioning
about
the
related
crimes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
has
no
relation
to
the
pending
charge,
except
it
was
part
of
the
same
bunch
of
transactions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
he's...
the
lawyer,
the
good,
conscientious
lawyer
would
say,
well,
don't
talk
to
me
about
that
because
i'm
not
going
to
get
paid
for
any
advice
i
give
to
you
on
that,
on
those
matters?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
it
doesn't
survive
the
blockburger
test,
the
fact
that
it
happened
at
the
same
time,
that
wouldn't
justify
the
lawyer
spending
any
time
on
it?
