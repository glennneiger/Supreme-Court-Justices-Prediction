mr.
coleman,
do
i
understand
from
what
you
just
said
that
if
everything
had
occurred
in
walker
county,
if
there
had
been
no
moving
of
cobb
to
odessa,
no
bail,
everything
happens
in
walker
county,
and
ridley
is
appointed
to
represent
cobb,
the
walker
county
law
enforcement
personnel
never
consult
ridley
before
interrogating
cobb
repeatedly,
it
would
still
be,
in
your
view,
no
violation
of
any
sixth
amendment
right;
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
the
police
did
was
something
they
didn't
need
to
do.
in
other
words,
the
police
did
twice
call
ridley
while
he,
while
cobb
was
still
in
walker
county.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
twice
called
him
and
said,
is
it
okay
if
we
question
your
client,
and
ridley
said
yes
both
times,
but
that
was
something
extra
the
police
did
they
were
not
required
to
do,
in
your
view?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
any
event,
they
did
tell
him,
we're
going
to
talk
to
your
client,
is
it
okay,
and
he
said
yes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
coleman,
there
are...
there's
quite
a
range.
there's
one,
the
mcneil
case
itself,
where
the
uncharged
offenses
were
wholly
unrelated,
different
time,
different
place,
and
here
you
have
one
continuous
episode.
don't
most
courts,
if
i
understand
them
correctly,
think
that
if
there
is
a
close
relationship
between
the
offenses,
if
they're
all
part
of
one
series
of
events,
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
would
attach?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
blatt,
you
gave
the
example,
or
i
think
your
brief
indicates
that
you
would
support
the
example
that
if
the
crime
for
which
the
person
is
already
charged
is
burglary,
and
they
can't
ask
him
about
the
homicide
at
the
time
of
burglary
because
that
would
be
a
greater...
that
would
be
the
same
crime,
yes,
in
that
legal
sense
that
we
understand
for
double
jeopardy
purposes.
but
this
has
got
to
be
administered
by
police
officers,
and
a
police
officer
will
say
gee,
homicide
is
a
lot
different
from
burglary.
i
don't
understand
when
it's
okay
and
when
it
isn't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
would
think
the
lay
person
would
understand,
it
all
happened
in
the
same
episode,
more
readily
than
would
understand
blockburger.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
workable
in
court
from
double
jeopardy
determinations;
workable
when
you're
talking
about
the
police
officer,
i'm
less
certain.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
greenwood--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they...
first,
the
odessa
people
didn't
know
that
he
had
counsel.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
another
aspect
to
this
that
i
hope
you
will
address.
in
this...
it
seems
to
me
that
this
case
may
not
be
a
strong
case
for
your
position,
even
if
we
were
to
take
a
related
offense
view
of
it.
as
i
understand
jackson,
the
purpose
was
to
keep
the
police
from
badgering
a
defendant,
keep
coming
back
at
him
and
back
at
him,
and
even
though
he's
been
given
miranda
warnings,
to
wear
down
his
will.
in
this
case
there
was
a
considerable
interval
of
time.
defendant
was
out
of
custody,
he
was
living
with
his
father,
and
in
that
interval
he
could
have
talked
to
his
lawyer
many
times.
when
he
has
that
interval
why,
in
that
case,
isn't
miranda
enough,
when
he's
not
in
custody
where
he's--
