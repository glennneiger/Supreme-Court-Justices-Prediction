chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
99-1702,
the
state
of
texas,
petitioner,
v.
raymond
levi
cobb.
i
have
misplaced
my...
here
we
go.
mr.
coleman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
mcneil
say
that
it's
offense
specific?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why?
now,
why
is
that,
because
it
satisfies
the,
or
doesn't
satisfy
the
blockburger
test?
that's
quite
a
burden
to
put
on
a
police
officer.
i
mean,
we
have
a
hard
enough
time
applying
that
test
ourselves,
and
to
say
that
the
police
officer
would
be
responsible
for
a
blockburger
analysis
really
is
quite
demanding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
name
of
the
case
you
said,
clanky?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
coleman.
ms.
blatt,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
blatt.
mr.
greenwood,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
its
statement
that
sixth
amendment
right
is
offense
specific?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
to
go
beyond
that,
don't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
a
categorical
statement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
are
asking
us
to
go
beyond
our
cases.
you're
asking
us
to
distinguish
mcneil
and
very
sharply
limit
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
you
can
limit
any
one
of
our
opinions
in
that
respect
to
say,
you
know,
this
happened
on
a
tuesday
and
not
on
a
wednesday,
but
we
employ
statements
as
to
what
we
think
the
law
is
and
so
on
in
deciding
these
cases,
and
it
isn't
always
limited
just
to
the
particular
facts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
definition
of,
quote,
intertwined,
close
quote,
or
interrelated,
close
quote?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
okay.
what
is
a...
you
know,
this
doesn't
make
it
any
easier.
what's
a
transaction?
what's
an
incident?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
think
this
case
meets
that
definition--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--of
the
same
time?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean,
you'll
go
along
with
it
if
we
do
that?
you
don't
have
much
choice.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--he
can
say
no
any
time.
he
can
refuse
to
talk
to
them.
his
lawyer
has
advised
him.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
greenwood.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
coleman,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
coleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
99-1702,
taxes
against
cobb.
in
december
1993
the
home
of
lindsey,
margaret
and
kori
rae
owings
was
burglarized
in
taxes.
margaret
and
kori
rae
were
missing.
acting
on
a
anonymous
tip,
the
police
questioned
cobb
about
the
events
and
he
ultimately
confessed
the
burglary,
but
denied
any
involvement
in
the
disappearances
of
margaret
and
kori
rae.
he
was
indicted
for
the
burglary
and
counsel
was
appointed
to
represent
him
in
connection
with
that
charge.
while
free
on
bond
awaiting
trial
on
the
burglary
case,
cobb
confessed
to
his
father
that
he
had
murdered
margaret
and
kori
rae
in
the
course
of
the
burglary.
cobb’s
father
informed
local
authority,
who
then
secured
a
warrant
for
his
arrest
and
took
him
under
custody
after
waiving
his
miranda
rights,
he
confessed
of
the
murders.
he
was
convicted
of
capital
murder
and
sentenced
to
death.
on
appeal
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
taxes,
cobb
argued
that
his
confession
to
police
should
have
been
suppressed
because
it
was
obtained
in
violation
of
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
he
argued
that
the
appointment
of
counsel
on
the
burglary
charge
meant
that
police
could
not
question
him
about
the
disappearances.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
agreed
holding
that,
once
the
right
to
counsel
attaches
to
the
offence
charge
it
also
attaches
to
any
other
offence
that
is
very
closely
factually
related
to
the
offence
charge.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
taxes
court
of
criminal
appeals.
in
a
case
called
mcneil
against
wisconsin
decided
about
ten
years
ago,
we
explained
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
is
offence
specific.
however,
several
state
courts
and
federal
courts
of
appeals
including
the
court
below
in
this
case
have
read
into
mcneil’s
offence
specific
definition
an
exception
for
crimes
that
are
what
they
call
factually
related
to
a
charged
offence.
such
an
exception
finds
no
support
in
our
case
law
and
we
believe
this
is
fundamentally
misguided.
preventing
police
from
questioning
charge
defendants
regarding
uncharged
defenses
with
seriously
impair
the
ability
of
law
enforcement
officers
to
investigate
and
solve
crimes.
often
times
police
simply
will
not
know
whether
their
investigation
will
touch
upon
crimes
that
are
somehow
factually
related
to
charged
defenses.
requiring
the
police
to
foretell
as
yet
unknown
facts
in
order
to
avoid
violating
the
sixth
amendment
would
deter
necessary
police
activity
and
lead
to
the
exclusion
of
voluntary
confessions.
conversely
defendants
are
particularly
well
situated
to
protect
their
rights
to
consult
with
counsel
and
remain
silent.
not
only
will
defendants
enjoy
the
full
scope
of
their
fifth
amendment
rights
under
miranda
versus
arizona,
but
they
will
have
also
the
opportunity
to
consult
with
counsel
in
connection
with
the
formal
charges
that
have
been
brought.
we
therefore
hold
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
attaches
only
to
a
formally
charged
defense,
as
that
term
is
defined
under
the
test
set
forth
in
the
blockburger
case.
accordingly
respondent’s
right
to
counsel
on
the
burglary
charge
did
not
encompass
the
entirely
distinct
defense
of
capital
murder.
respondent’s
confession
to
the
murders
was
properly
admissible.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justices
scalia
and
thomas
join;
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens,
souter,
and
ginsburg
join.
