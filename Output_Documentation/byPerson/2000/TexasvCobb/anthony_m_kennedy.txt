justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
taking
justice
ginsburg's
question
a
little
bit
further,
suppose
you
have
this
situation:
the
counsel
is
there,
they
begin
questioning
him
on
the
break
in.
the
police
then
say,
counsel,
we'd
like
to
see
you
outside
a
minute,
and
they
go
outside
of
the
interrogation
room
and
they
say,
counsel,
you
know,
we're
not
interested
in
the
stereo,
we're
interested
in
the
murder.
could
a
responsible
attorney
say,
oh,
well,
i'm
not
representing
him
on
that,
go
back
in
the
room,
ask
him
all
the
questions
you
want?
i
would
be
amazed
if
an
attorney
could
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
under
the
hypothetical
we
were
just
discussing
and
the
answer
you
gave
to
justice
o'connor,
i
suppose
the
police
could
say,
and
we're
now
going
to
question
him
about
that
murder
so
we
want
you
out
of
the
room.
you
can't
go
back
in
that
room.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
true.
what
i'm
concerned
about
is
the
possibility
for
some
manipulation,
if
the
police
hold
and
charge
on
the
lesser
offense
merely
to
bide
their
time
until
they
begin
questioning
about
the
more
serious
offense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
it's
become
even
harder.
i
assume
the
police
officer
ought
to
know
that
if
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
interrogate
or
not,
and
you
say
well,
maybe
he
does,
maybe
he
doesn't,
depending
on
what
the
defendant
says.
that...
we've
never
given
that
insufficient
guidance
to
the
police.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
know
what
you'd
do,
too.
you'd
say,
take
the
miranda
advice
seriously,
refuse
to
answer
any
questions
now,
later,
a
week
from
now,
a
month
from
now,
and
then
you're
protected.
that's
it.
