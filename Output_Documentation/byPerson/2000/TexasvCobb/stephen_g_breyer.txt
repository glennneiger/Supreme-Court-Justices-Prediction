justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
obvious
problem
is
the
person
is
accused,
or
the
police
think
he
kidnapped,
murdered
and
raped
a
person,
or
they
think
he
distributed
drugs,
you
know,
and
my
first
example
could
involve
three
separate
crimes,
my
second
example
could
involve
possession,
a
telephone
count,
a
distribution
count,
and
if
there
was
more
than
one
person
a
conspiracy,
all
right?
so
the
police
indict
the
person
for
one
of
those
four,
or
two
of
them,
and
he
gets
a
lawyer,
and
the
next
minute
they
turn
around
and
start
asking
him
questions.
they
say,
oh,
we
were
asking
him
about
the
other
two.
it's
all
the
same
event.
so
i
mean,
what
could
a
constitution
mean
that
creates
that
situation?
that's
why
every
court
has
decided
that
it
doesn't
mean
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean
most.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
answer?
i
mean,
that...
i
think
my
problem
is
what
has
led
almost
all
the
courts
to
adopt
this
fuzzier
test,
and
what
is
the
response
to
that
rather
direct
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
won't
be
trickery.
if
the
rule
is
you
cannot...
you
know,
the
counsel
relates
only
to
the
offense
charged,
there's
no
trick
involved.
the
police,
in
total
good
faith,
go
and
ask
the
same
set
of
questions
relating
to
the
kidnapping
without
telling
the
counsel.
there's
no
trick,
and
that
seems
not
a
trick,
it
seems
absurd.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
lower
courts
have
all
agreed
with
you.
they've
all
agreed
with
you,
if
it's
actually
a
separate
crime.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
i
mean,
you
see
my
problem
from
what
i
said
before,
don't
you?
i
mean,
crime
is
ambiguous
as
to
whether
you're
describing
a
set
of
events
in
the
world,
or
a
legal
concept.
look
at
the
set
of
events
in
the
world.
it
would
have
all
been
over
in
15
seconds,
and
it
could
constitute
any
one
of
15
crimes,
and
the
police
charge
on
the
basis
of
that
15
seconds
of
real
world
behavior
three
crimes,
and
he
gets
a
lawyer
for
those
three.
why
should
the
police
be
able,
without
a
lawyer,
to
interrogate
him
about
what
happened
in
the
real
world
because
there
are
eight
other
things
that
weren't
charged?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it's
purely
formal.
your
argument
is
purely
formal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
circumstance
of,
i
didn't
know
that
the
word,
offense
specific,
in
mcneil,
whether
it
referred
to
something
on
paper--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--namely,
the
definition
of
a
crime,
or
something
in
the
world,
such
as
the
robber
entering
the
bank,
hitting
the
teller
and
taking
the
money,
which,
of
course,
could
be
one
of
several
crimes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
don't
want
you
just
to
accept
it
because
maybe
what
i've
just
said
is
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
just
an
exemption.
you've
said
that,
i
think,
the
law
enforcement
would
be
seriously
hamstrung--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
the
simple
fact
that
a
person
had
a
lawyer
stopped
policemen
from
asking
him
questions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
but
that
isn't
true
where
you're
talking
about
a
single
offense
defined
in
terms
of
what
happens
in
the
world,
i
take
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
to
stop
to
ask
a
less
friendly
question,
i
think
what's
worrying
the
department
and
others
is
that
once
you
depart
from
the
definition
of
offense
in
terms
of
some
words
on
paper,
i.e.,
once
you
start
looking
to
what
happened
in
the
world,
there's
no
good
way
to
define
what
is
the
same
offense,
and
therefore
they
get
into
a
mess,
and
therefore
we
have
six
different
circuits
trying
to
do
different
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
say
in
response
to
that,
no,
there
is
a
good
way,
and
what
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
that
a
person
is...
what's
the
law
in
the
following
situation?
the
person,
a
defendant
is
put
into
custody,
a
suspect,
he's
interrogated.
he's
told
about
his
miranda
rights.
he
gets
a
lawyer,
and
then
he's
not
charged,
all
right?
he's
not
charged.
the
next
day,
although
the
police
know
he
got
a
lawyer,
he
has
a
lawyer,
they
call
him
back
to
question
him
again
without
telling
the
lawyer.
can
they
do
that?
