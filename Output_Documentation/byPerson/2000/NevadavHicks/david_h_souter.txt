justice
david
h.
souter
does
your
argument
depend
on
the
fact
simply
that
there
is
uncertainty
under
the
jurisdictional
standard
as
to
how
far
the
tribal
court's
jurisdiction
goes,
or
would
your
argument
be
the
same
if
the
statute
were
clear
beyond
a
peradventure
of
a
doubt
that
someone
who
was
acting
in
what
you
describe
as
official
capacity
but
is
being
sued
in
his
individual
capacity
would
nonetheless
be
subject
to
jurisdiction?
in
other
words,
are
you
making
this
argument
in
order
to
construe
a
vague
jurisdictional
grant,
or
are
you
making
this
argument
into
something
that
would
be
entitled
to
prevail
no
matter
how
clear
the
statutory
grant
was?
justice
david
h.
souter
while
we're
on
the
subject
of
federal
statutes,
one
thing
you
said
surprised
me,
and
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
it.
is
it
your
position...
do
you
understand
that
there
is
no
federal
statutory
recognition
for
tribal
jurisdiction?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
about
other
cases?
i
mean--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
there
are
all
specific
to
the
tribe
or
to
the
jurisdiction?
there
is
no
general
statutory
recognition?
justice
david
h.
souter
was
that
opinion
an
opinion
of
state
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
he
was
applying
federal...
the
attorney
general
of
nevada
was--
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean
injunction?
justice
david
h.
souter
as
i
understand
it,
the
tribe's
position
would
allow
for
an
injunction
on
either
or
both
of
two
grounds.
one,
of
course,
the
jurisdictional
issue
could
be
reviewed
again
as
the
basis
for
the
injunction,
and
if
the
tribe
won
the
jurisdictional
issue,
then
presumably
the
merits
of
the
1983
claim
could
also
be
litigated
in
the
federal
court,
and
if
the
federal
court
thought
the
tribal
court
was
wrong
on
that,
it
would
enjoin
enforcement
of
the
judgment.
is
that
correct?
is
that
the
way
it
would
work?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
if
you
lost
and
you
went
back
and
you
exhausted
on
the
merits,
there
would
be
another
opportunity
to
go
into
the
federal
court
for
a
different
injunction.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
i
didn't
understand.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
don't
mean
to
cut
you
off...
i
thought
maybe
you
would
address
this.
el
paso
was
a
stronger
case
for
your
position
in
one
respect,
at
least,
because
in
el
paso,
i
think,
as
i
recall
it,
the
federal
statute
preempted
all
other
causes
of
action
so
that
the
federal
right
was,
in
effect,
was
exclusive,
because
you
don't
have
that
feature
here.
so
if
there's
an
injunction
in
this
case
on
the
el
paso
model,
it
in
effect
would
leave
the
litigation
to
go
forward
on
non-1983
claims
arising,
i
mean,
for
example,
tribal
tort
claims.
so
the
result
would
sort
of
be
a
bifurcation
of
the
litigation
and
sort
of
a
mess,
and
you
didn't
have
that
feature
in
el
paso.
shouldn't
that
bear
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
want
to
follow
the
el
paso
model
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
i
mean
this
is
getting
rube
goldberg.
now
there's
another
rule
and
pendent
jurisdictional
claims
are
now
being
removed
by
means
of
a
novel
use
of
injunction.
i
mean,
there's
a
character
here
that
we're
making
up
an
awful
lot
as
we
go
along
on
your
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what
is
the
justification,
then,
for
saying
to
the
tribes
that
they
could
not
proceed
in
their
related
tort
actions
in
the
tribal
courts
merely
because
we
think
the
1983
action
should
be
enjoined
for
purposes
of
quasi-removal.
what
is
the
basis
for
saying
that
they
can't
receive
in
their
own
courts
under
their
own
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
what
i'm
getting
at
is
your
notion
that
all...
that
these
tribal
tort
law
claims
would
be
deemed
pendent
to
the
1983
actions
and
enjoined
with
them.
i
am
saying
what
is
your
basis
for
saying...
is
it
simply
a
basis
of
convenience
to
the
defendant?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we've
got
a
statute
on
it.
we've
got
a
statute.
