justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
he
just
goes
and
buys
some
gasoline
and
doesn't
pay
for
it.
say
he
drives
up
to
the
tribal
gas
station,
buys
some
gasoline,
drives
off,
doesn't
pay
for
it.
i
mean,
can
they
sue
him
for
the
money
in
the
tribal
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
read
another
brief...
a
1934
opinion
of
the
solicitor
general
who
said
that
the
tribes
under
acts
passed
by
congress
had
the
basic
sovereignty
that
they
had
for
generations,
unless
it
was
taken
away.
and
i
guess
for
generations
they
could
have
sued
people
who
went
and
bought
gasoline
without
paying
for
it.
i
don't
know
if
it
always
would
have
been
gasoline,
but
i
assume
a
basic
contract
action
would
be
within
their
grant,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why,
just
out
of
curiosity...
not
quite
just
out
of
curiosity,
but
why
didn't
the
defendant
instead
of
sort
of
engaging
in
all
of
these
proceedings
for
ten
years...
why
didn't
he
simply
remove
the
case
to
federal
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
didn't
the
defendant
in
this
case
simply
remove
it
to
the
federal
court?
there
is
no--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
it
says...
you'd
have
to
read
the
word
state
to
mean
state
or
a
tribe.
but
one...
maybe
you
can't,
maybe
you
can't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
for
you
it
might
be.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
that
is
an
issue.
but
if
that's
possible,
then
doesn't
that
offer
a
perfect
solution?
there's
no
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
any
state
official's
not
bothered,
all
he
has
to
do
is
remove,
and
then
that
would
be
the
end
of
any
potential
conflict.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
you
try
to
remove
it?
maybe
it's
just
obviously
impossible
to
do,
and
if
it
is
impossible
to
do,
then
the
conflict
of
interest
that
you're
talking
about
exists,
but
that's
why
i
wondered...
i
see
a
lot
of
cases
where
apparently
it
starts
off
in
the
tribal
court,
and
then
they're
over
in
the
federal
court,
and
there
are
injunctions
being
issued
back
and
forth.
what's
the
basis?
is
there
some...
i'm
trying
to
see
if
this
conflict
of
interest
is
necessarily
there.
the
basis
is
you
can't
remove.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
question
is
best
reserved
for
the
solicitor
general.
i
mean,
you're
not
aware
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
still...
i'm
not
going
to
give
up
yet
on
getting
your
opinion
on
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
the
solicitor
general
precisely
recommends
is
recognizing
the
policy
of
the
removal
statute,
namely
remove...
that's
the
policy...
that
you
could
have
what
the
court
did
in
el
paso
which
is,
quote,
an
injunction
given
by
a
federal
court
against
further
litigation
in
tribal
courts
that
in
practical
effect
gives
the
same
result
as
a
removal.
now,
that's
the
solicitor
general's
precise...
which
then
just
like
removal
would
eliminate
any
possibility
of
conflict
between
state
and
tribal
interests.
so
that's
what
i'd
like
your
comment
on.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
your
case
it
would
resolve
because
the
whole
case
would
come
along,
and
what
you'd
say
about
other
cases
is
sufficient
unto
the
day.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
normally
when
you
remove,
the
entire
case
goes
with
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
if
the
injunction
is
the
same
as
removal,
you
get
to
the
result
that
you
want
in
respect
to
all
of
the
claim.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
about
john
marshall,
cherokee
nation
v.
georgia?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
after
exhaustion?
i
could
imagine--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
it
work?
that
is,
in
your
view
on
the
tribal
claims.
your
view
is
that
the
torts...
if
the
tribe...
suppose
the
tribe
has
a
strict
liability
tort
theory
and
there
is
no
defense
of
official
action,
and
it
says
that
all
the
fbi
agents,
bivens
agents,
department
of
interior
agents,
anybody
you
want
in
the
federal
government,
is
now
going
to
be
strictly
liable
for
their
torts,
okay?
now,
in
your
view
they
could
just
go
do
that.
that's
the
government's
view.
that's
the
federal
government's
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
where
do
they
come
from?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
they're
going
to
have...
and
are
we
now
going
to
have
a
new
sort
of
federal
government
thing
we're
making
up,
which...
well,
then
why
not
have
it
all
in
the
federal
court?
i
mean,
i'm
a
little
worried
about
what
we're
getting
into
when
we're
making
these
things
up.
that's
not
meant
to
be
a
criticism...
i'm
just
quite...
having
a
hard
time
foreseeing
where
this
case
is
going.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
that
situation,
i'm
just
thinking,
aren't
you
really
on
the
other
side?
imagine
this
is
only
the
1983
action.
what's
the
difference
between
your
position
and
their
position?
their
position
is
that
the
1983
action
has
to
be
brought
in
federal
court.
your
position
is
that
it
has
to
be
brought
in
federal
court
as
long
as
the
defendant
wants
to
do
it.
that
seems
to
me
the
only
practical
difference.
am
i
right?
