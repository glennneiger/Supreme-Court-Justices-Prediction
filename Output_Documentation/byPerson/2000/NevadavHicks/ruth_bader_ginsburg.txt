justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
howle,
i
could
understand
a
position
that
says
when
a
state
official
is
acting
pursuant
to
state
authority...
there's
a
warrant,
a
state
warrant...
that
that
person
can't
be
questioned
in
tribal
court.
but
suppose
this
officer,
instead
of
going
in
with
a
warrant,
just
went
in,
rammed
down
the
door,
beat
up
the
plaintiff.
he's
still
wearing
his
state
uniform,
and
he's
still
looking
for
evidence
of
whatever
animal
that
was...
would
you
say
that
even
in
such
a
case
there
would
be
no
tribal
court
jurisdiction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
not
even
making
a
distinction
that's
often
made
in
these
public
employment
cases
between
acting
within
the
scope
of
one's
authority
and
going
so
far
beyond
the
pale
of
anything
that
would
fit
within
that
authority
as
to
be
on
a
frolic
of
one's
own.
you
wouldn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
that
much
is
right,
then
getting
the
back-up
of
the
tribal
court's
approval
for
the
warrant
was
just
a
polite
gesture,
meaning
a
form
that
was
not
necessary
legally.
in
other
words,
here
we
do
have
an
investigation
of
something
that
occurred
off
the
reservation.
the
warrant
is
to
go
on
the
reservation
to
investigate,
but
the
crime
itself
was
off
reservation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
think
justice
scalia
asked
you,
would
the
tribal
court
have
authority
to
prosecute
a
case
that
occurred
off
the
reservation.
i
think
you
said
the
answer
was
no.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
not
certain
about
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
the
next
thing
is
that
the
crime
occurs
off
the
reservation.
the
warrant
is
to
go
on
the
reservation
and
conduct
a
search
there.
as
you
understand
it,
it
is
not
necessary
to
get
any
permission
of
any
kind
from
the
tribe,
because
what
the
state
official
is
enforcing
is
an
investigation
for
a
crime
that
occurred
off
the
reservation.
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
now
you
are
confirming
that
it
was
a
matter
of
a
test
to
ask
the
tribe,
but
it
was
not
necessary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
howle,
if
that
had
been
the
case,
then
this
court
would
not
have
had
to
go
through
the
motions
it
went
through
in
those
two
cases
that
says
you
have
to
exhaust
the
tribe,
and
then
you
can
go
into
the
district
court
at
the
end
of
the
line.
it's
only
because
you
couldn't
get
out...
there
was...
i
am
unaware
of
any
authority
that
says
you
can
remove
from
the
tribal
court
to
any
other
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
those
two
cases
that
we
had,
that
said
that's
what
you
do.
you
go
to
the
district
court.
and
i
think
in
those
cases
they
said
the
reason
why
you
have
to
do
that
is
that
there
is
no
removal.
that
was
the
whole
point
of
nevada
coming
into
the
district
court.
if
you
could
have
removed
to
get
there,
you
wouldn't
have
to
bring
an
action...
an
independent
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
there
were
statements
in
more
than
one
of
our
cases
to
the
effect
that
there
is
no
removal
from
tribal
to
federal
court.
and
you
say
you
don't
know?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
this
case
had
been
brought
in
state
court
under
1983,
could
the
tribal
claims
that
were
being
asserted
under
tribal
law
be
pended
to
that
action
in
state
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
other
words,
these
claims
under
tribal
law
are
left
to
the
grace
of
the
state.
the
state
can
allow
them
if
it
wants
to,
disallow
them
if
it
wants
to.
so
you're
saying,
as
far
as
tribal
law
is
concerned,
the
tribe
has
no
authority,
and
the
state
is
not
obliged
to
hear
those
claims.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
this
had
been
a
federal
officer
executing
a
similar
warrant
investigating
violation
of
federal--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you'd
have
to
wait
until
the
end
of
the
line,
and
that
seems
to
be
at
odds
with
the
notion
of
qualified
immunity
that
you
get
out
sooner
rather
than
later.
here
your
positing
a
case...
and
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
supported
it...
that
you
must
exhaust
in
the
tribal
court,
even
your
qualified
immunity
defense,
you
must
exhaust
in
the
tribal
court
before
you
can
come
over
to
seek
an
injunctive
relief
in
the
federal
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
really
making
up
a
statute
that
congress
didn't
pass
because
that's
what
happens...
a
federal
officer
is
sued
in
state
court.
he
can
remove
it.
why
can
he
remove
it?
because
congress
has
said
so.
so
here
congress
has
said
nothing
at
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you
have
to
think
that
the
ninth
circuit
got
it
all
wrong
here,
because
as
i
take
it,
you're
saying
we
let
the
tribal
members
sue
in
tribal
court,
but
the
defendant
state
officer
the
next
day
can
remove
it
and
there's
nothing
that
the
tribe
or
the
tribal
member
can
do
about
it.
it's
just
kind
of
we
let
them
park
for
an
hour
in
the
tribal
court,
and
then
the
federal
officer
has
the
control,
or
the
state
officer
has
the
control,
can
get
it
immediately
into
a
federal
court.
is
that
your
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
officer's
position?
i
don't
care
whether
they
say
it's
tribal
or
1983...
i
am
cloaked
with
immunity
because
i
was
executing
a
state
warrant,
and
that
should
be
resolved
in
a
state
or
federal
forum,
not
in
a
tribal
forum.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
this
case
could
remain
in
tribal
court
if
they
just
alleged
tribal
torts,
the
officer
says
i
have
qualified
immunity,
i
don't
want
that
resolved
in
tribal
court,
but
it
belongs
in
tribal
court,
in
your
view
of
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
far?
it's
only
under
the
tribal
code.
qualified
immunity
is
the
defense.
at
what
point
does
that
get
over
into
a
federal
court?
