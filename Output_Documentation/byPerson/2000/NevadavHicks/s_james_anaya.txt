mr.
s.
james
anaya
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
began
when
nevada
game
wardens
sought
the
approval
of
fallon
tribal
court
not
once
but
twice,
in
order
to
come
on
the
fallon
reservation
and
conduct
a
search
against
a
tribal
member.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
we
disagree,
and
the
authority
of
this
court
will
indicate
the
contrary.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
williams
v.
lee,
and
its
progeny,
your
honor,
which
establishes
clearly
that
the
sovereignty
of
tribes
precludes
the
authority
of
the
state
to
the
extent
it
interferes
with
the
ability
of
the
tribe
to
make
its
own
laws
and
be
governed
by
them.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
your
honor,
the
tribal
court...
if
this
were
a
crime
under
tribal
law,
and
it
is
not
a
crime
under
tribal
law
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
it
could
as
to
members,
perhaps.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
by
members.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
the
state
could,
in
any
instance,
prosecute
this
case.
what
is
at
issue
here
is
whether
it
can
go
onto
the
reservation
to
execute
a
warrant.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
that
may
be.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
the
state
judge
who
issued
the
state
warrant
agreed
with
that
position.
the
state
judge
himself
explicitly
said
on
the
face
of
the
warrant
that
the
warrant
was
invalid
within
the
reservation--
mr.
s.
james
anaya
--well,
he
could
be
wrong,
but
we...
he
got
it
right
as
far
as
our
position
goes,
your
honor.
the
attorney
general
of
nevada
himself
has
issued
an
opinion,
has
issued
an
opinion
saying
that
the
state
has
no
authority
to
go
on
the
reservation
to
execute
searches
or
investigate
crimes
against
members.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
your
honor,
that's
not
in
our
brief.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
well,
your
honor,
we
were
surprised--
mr.
s.
james
anaya
--yes.
well,
it
was
an
opinion
of
federal
law.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
the
opinion
was
applying
an
interpretation
of
federal
law,
and
the
lower
court
have
held
the
same.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
exactly,
your
honor.
the
laws
of
the
state
of
georgia
have
no
force
in
the
territory
of
the
cherokee.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
yes,
your
honor.
the
turtle
case.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
the
turtle
case
that
we
cited.
i
believe
it's
the
ninth
circuit,
which
specifically
precluded
arizona
from
going
onto
the
navajo
reservation
and
trying
to
execute
a
warrant
against
people
on
the
reservation.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
well,
that
would
be
a
different
matter,
your
honor.
under
the
major
crimes
act,
federal
officers
do
have
jurisdiction
over
the
reservations.
this
is
a
state
officer,
and
the
weight
of
authority
in
the
lower
federal
courts
and
in
the
state
courts
interpreting
federal
law
is
that
state
authorities
do
not
have
the
authority
to
go
on
the
reservation
and
execute
warrants--
mr.
s.
james
anaya
--most
of
it,
your
honor,
or
a
good
deal
of
it,
at
least,
and
the
turtle
case
is--
mr.
s.
james
anaya
--well,
we
have
authority...
the
attorney
general's
opinion
that
i
cited
to.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
the
attorney
general's
opinion
number
80-42.
nevada
highway
patrol
jurisdiction
on
indian
reservations.
nevada...
again,
opinion
number
80-42,
and
we
can
make
this
available--
mr.
s.
james
anaya
--does
nevada
highway
patrol
acting
under
the
authority
granted
by
the
state,
have
the
authority
to
investigate
accidents
on
a
reservation?
to
go
onto
the
reservation,
investigate
accidents--
mr.
s.
james
anaya
--occurring
wherever...
to
investigate
accidents
on
the
reservation,
even
to
pursue
someone
onto
the
reservation.
and
the
nevada
attorney
general,
citing
federal
authority,
citing
the
opinions
of
other
state
courts,
says
no.
this
is
the
common
understanding.
this
was
the
understanding
of
the
state
judge
who
issued
the
warrant.
it
was
the
understanding
of
the
tribal
authorities
that
the
state
authorities
could
not
go
onto
the
reservation.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
i
think
that's
right...
they
did
have
an
epiphany.
in
their
opening
brief,
they
didn't
pick
this
position.
they
did
not
pick
this
position.
you
will
recall
that
mr.
howle,
in
articulating
the
position,
now
referred
to
the
reply
brief.
he
did
not
reply
to
the
opening
brief.
this
came
as
a
surprise
to
us.
if
they
had
taken
that
position,
you
can
be
sure
we
would
have
included
sufficient
authority
for
the
proposition
that
the
state
authorities
cannot
go
onto
the
reservation
to
investigate
crimes
committed
even
off
of
the
reservation
by
nonmembers,
or
allegedly
by
nonmembers.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
yes.
no.
they're
all
state
officials.
three
state
officers
who
participated.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
that
is
correct.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
yes.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
it's
ambiguous.
they
raised
it
in
the
context
of
a
motion
to
quash
service
of
process.
they
raised
the
threshold
of
jurisdictional
issues
and
conflated
what
appeared
to
be
personal
immunity
defenses
with
those.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
tribal
court
only
reached
the
threshold--
mr.
s.
james
anaya
--that
is
correct.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
that's
correct.
the
state
went
immediately
to
federal
district
court.
the
state
could
have--
mr.
s.
james
anaya
--after
a
month,
after
about
two
weeks,
i
think.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
in
that
time
period--
mr.
s.
james
anaya
--after
the
court
ruled.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
it
did
not.
the
state
could
have
immediately
moved
for
a
motion
to
dismiss.
at
that
time
we
presumed
that
the
tribal
court
would
convene
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
would
have
heard
the
personal
immunity
defenses,
would
have
heard--
mr.
s.
james
anaya
--that's
right.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
the
district
court,
nor
the
circuit
court,
dealt
with
the
personal
immunity
defenses
because
they
applied
the
rule
of
exhaustion.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
the
complaint
by
mr.--
mr.
s.
james
anaya
--the
complaint
by
mr.
hicks
before
the
tribal
court
pleads
violations
of
united
states
constitutional
law.
those
allegations
have
been
treated
as
allegations
under
section
1983.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
yes,
i
do.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
we...
it
is
a
1983
action.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
i
am
not.
i
am
not,
and
we're
not
contending
necessarily
the
tribal
courts
would
not
be
subject
to
review.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
it
would
happen
along
the
device
that
justice
souter
has
suggested...
excuse
me,
justice
breyer
has
suggested...
a
device
that
the
united
states
has
suggested
as
well--
mr.
s.
james
anaya
--well,
that
wouldn't
be
a
review,
but
that
would
be
a
device
by
which
the
action
could
be
heard
by
the
federal
court.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
yes,
an
injunction.
another
possibility--
mr.
s.
james
anaya
--your
honor--
mr.
s.
james
anaya
--it
is.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
and
we
are
not
saying
that
we
would
favor
that
approach.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
that
is
yet
to
be
determined...
could
be
determined
by
the
lower
courts.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
your
honor,
mr.
hicks
at
this
point
would
choose
not
to
take
a
position
because
in
litigating
the
case
in
the
tribal
court,
if
this
court
were
to
affirm
jurisdiction,
he
would
have
to
explore
his
options
whether
or
not
it
would
be
to
his
advantage
to
seek
some
kind
of
review
depending
upon
the
tribal
court,
however--
mr.
s.
james
anaya
--i
simply
articulated
the
position
to
mr.
hicks.
the
position
of
the
tribe
and
the
tribal
court
in
this
case
is
that
there
could
be
review.
there
could
be
review
after
exhaustion,
and
that
would
be
the
appropriate--
mr.
s.
james
anaya
--that
would
be
more
the
removal
theory
of
the
united
states.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
the
review
mechanism
would
work
something
along
the
lines
of
the
following
although,
again,
this
is
uncharted
territory.
the
claims
would
be
exhausted
in
tribal
court,
and
then
assuming
that
the
defendants
were
to
lose,
they
could
then
go
to
the
federal
court
and
seek
some
kind
of
relief
against
the
tribal
court.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
well,
it
would
be
the
same
kind
of...
essentially
the
same
kind
of
action
that
defendants
have
taken
in
order
to
challenge
the
jurisdiction
of
trial
courts...
essentially
an
injunction
action.
but
in
the
course
of
determining
whether
or
not
an
injunction
should
lie,
the
court
would
then
review
the
jurisdictional
issues
as
well
as
the
merits,
or
at
least
the
application
of
the
law
in
the
section
1983
action.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
it
applied
the
rule
of
exhaustion
that
this
court
laid
down
in
national
farmers
union,
as
well
as
iowa
mutual
v.
laplante.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
yes,
they
did,
but
it
could
be
that
the
exhaustion
could
also
apply
to
the
merits,
and
indeed
could.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
strictly
speaking,
i
believe
it
did.
this
court
has
articulated
the
exhaustion
rule
as
one
of
comity,
and
so
out
of
comity,
out
of
respect
for
the
tribal
court--
mr.
s.
james
anaya
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is
the
case.
but
the
exhaustion
doctrine
is
a
flexible
one,
and
it
is
intended
to
accommodate
the
interests
that
might--
mr.
s.
james
anaya
--the
position
of
the
tribe
in
this
case
is
that
there
could
be
substantive
review,
and--
mr.
s.
james
anaya
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
right.
the
way
we
contemplate
it
working,
if
such
an
exhaustion
were
to
apply
to
a
1983
cause
of
action
or
to
the
tribal
cause
of
action
in
this
case,
would
be
for
the
tribal
court
to
immediately
move
forward
to
determine
the
qualified
or
personal
immunity
defenses.
and
at
that
point,
the
defendant
could
go
to
federal
court
to
seek
review
of
that
prior
to
an
adjudication
of
the
merits
of
the
claim
in
the
tribal
court.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
well,
what
we're
suggesting,
or
what
the
model
would
suggest,
is
that
there
would
be
the
opportunity
to
go
immediately
upon
a
determination
in
the
tribal
court
of
the
qualified
immunity
defense
to
the
federal
court,
so
it
would
be
in
the
nature
of
a
interlocutory
review.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
perhaps,
your
honor,
but
the
rationale
of
national
farmers
union
of
iowa
mutual,
i
think,
counseled
in
favor
of
what
the
district
court
did.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think--
mr.
s.
james
anaya
--and
i
think
it
does.
the
rationale
is
to
support
the
self-governance
of
the
tribe,
and
to
support
the
development
of
tribal
courts
and
their
autonomy.
and
for
the
district
court
to
have
ruled
on
something--
mr.
s.
james
anaya
--well,
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
situation
here
is
one
in
which
we
have
a
tribal
court
struggling
to
maintain
its
jurisdiction,
and
the
deference
that
the
exhaustion
doctrine
gives
to
tribal
courts
is
warranted,
and
the
interests
of
the
state
officials...
the
federal
interest
that
might
exist
in
ensuring
that
their
interests
are
protected,
are
sufficiently
met
by
the
exhaustion
rule
as
long
as
there
is
some
kind
of
review
and,
perhaps,
an
interlocutory
review
of
the
personal
immunity
defenses.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
not
routinely,
your
honor,
but
there
is
nothing...
there
is
no
federal
law
that
precludes
them
from
hearing
a
1983
claim.
the
fallon
tribal
court
is
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction.
the
1983
statute
is
a
jurisdiction
intended
to
provide
broad
remedies
for
violations
of
constitutional
rights
and,
in
the
absence
of
an
affirmative
limitation
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
the
tribal
court,
under
federal
law,
it
seems
to
follow
quite
naturally
that
the
fallon
tribal
court
as
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction
would
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
a
section
1983--
mr.
s.
james
anaya
--the
theory
is
that
there
is
a
federal
interest
in
ensuring
that
the
state
defendants'
immunity
defenses
would
be
sufficiently
aired--
mr.
s.
james
anaya
--well,
that's
right.
this
would
assume
that
immunity
defenses
would
be
defenses
under
federal
law,
and
that
is
the
position
that
the
united
states
has
taken,
and
it's
a
position
that
the
tribe
accepts...
that
these
defenses
could
become
federal
law
and
hence
they
would
be
the
basis
for
review
in
federal
court.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
this
is
a
unique
context,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
james
anaya
it
is.
and
the
unique
context
and
wrinkles
that
exist
here
are
because
of
historical
situations
and
patterns
that
have
existed,
that
have
arisen
and
continued,
and
require
this
court
to--
mr.
s.
james
anaya
--that
would
solve
the
problem,
just
like--
