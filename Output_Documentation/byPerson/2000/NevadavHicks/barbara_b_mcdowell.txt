ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
tribal
court
has
jurisdiction
over
mr.
hicks'
civil
damages
suit
against
the
state
game
wardens
in
their
personal
capacities.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
we
would
say
that
the
federal
courts
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
that
sort
of
action,
as
in
el
paso
natural
gas.
we
think
that
there
should
be
an
opportunity
effectively
to
remove
the
case
to
federal
court
through
an
injunction.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
to
the
extent
it
existed
in
el
paso,
your
honor,
it
exists
here
as
well.
congress
has
expressed
its
preference
for
a
federal
forum
at
a
defendant's
request
when
he
has
been
sued
on
a
federal
cause
of
action.
that
occurs
through
the
removal
statute
when
the
defendant
is
sued
in
state
court.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
exclusive
jurisdiction,
your
honor--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--yes,
it
was,
with
respect,
your
honor.
it
was
a
removal
case.
it
was
a
case
in
which
there
was--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--only
if
the
defendant
raised
it,
your
honor,
the
case
would
be
free
to
proceed
in
state
court
for
a
nuclear
tort,
or
in
tribal
court,
unless
the
defendant
sought
a
federal
forum.
that
was
the
case
in
el
paso
as
we
understand
it,
and
that
would
also
be
the
case
here.
the
cases
under
1983
could
proceed
in
tribal
court,
but
if
the
defendant
elects
a
federal
forum,
he
should
be
entitled
to
that
at
the
outset
of
the
case
so
that
the
trial
of
the
facts--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
was
also
the
case
in
el
paso,
but
the
court
didn't
think
that
congress'
silence
in
that
instance
reflected
any
specific
intent
to
leave
the
case
in
tribal
court
if
a
defendant
wanted
it
in--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
the
reason
to
remove
it
is
because
the
plaintiff
has
asserted
a
federal
cause
of
action,
and
we
would
think
that
congress
would
want
a
defendant
sued
in
tribal
court
to
have
the
same
right
as
the
defendants
sued
in
state
court
to
get
a
federal
forum.
we
think
that
congress'
failure
to
provide
in
section
1441
for
removal
from
tribal
court
was
inadvertent,
it
doesn't
reflect
a
policy
choice
on
the
part
of
congress
that
such
cases
should
remain
in
tribal
court.
simply
the
fact
that--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--we
don't
think
that
would
be
the
necessary
result,
your
honor.
as
with
removal
from
state
court,
any
pendent
state
causes
of
action
follow
the
federal
cause
of
action.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
there
is
a
common
law
nature
to
much
of
this
court's
jurisprudence
with
respect
to
indian
law,
certainly
the
cases--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
they
certainly
can
choose
to
proceed
in
their
own
courts.
they're
the
masters
of
their
complaints,
and
they
can
drop
the
1983--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
that's
typically
the
treatment
of
state
law
claims
when
we
remove
to
federal
court.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
there
would
be
federal
immunity
defenses.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
they
come
from
the
federal
government's
unique
interest
in
law
enforcement
on
reservations.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
not
with
respect
to
indian
reservations,
your
honor.
the
federal
government
is
the
principal
law
enforcement
authority
on
the
reservations.
it
is
delegated
some
of
that
authority--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--not
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
footnote
seven
of
our
brief
cites
some
cases
on
the
proposition.
i
think
the
way
of
looking
at
this
is
in
the
state/state
context.
if
somebody
commits
a
criminal
offense
in
nevada,
yes,
nevada
has
the
right
to
prosecute
that
offense,
but
if
the
person
goes
to
california,
perhaps
even
lives
in
california,
if
nevada
wants
to
execute
a
search
warrant
against
that
person's
california
home,
the
nevada
warrant
isn't
self-executing.
there
is
a
need
to
go
to
a
california
court
to
get
approval
of
the
search,
and
we
would
say
that
the
same
model
applies
in
the
state/tribe
situation.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
as
a
practical
matter,
that
may
well
be
correct.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
although
the
tribal
plaintiff
would
have
the
opportunity
to
amend
his
complaint
to
assert
only
tribal
causes
of
action,
in
which
case
the
case
would
remain
at
least
initially
in
tribal
court.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
i
would
disagree
with
that.
we
believe
that
the
state
officers'
personal
immunities
are
matters
that
should
be
presented
first
to
the
tribal
court,
and
then
only
subsequently
to
the
federal
court.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
in
our
view,
in
the
ordinary
course
the
state
officer
defendant
should
raise
the
defense
first
in
tribal
court
and
then
would
have
review
of
the
defense
under
the
national
farmers
union
approach
in
federal
court
after
exhaustion.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
may
i
answer?
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
if
there's
not
an
opportunity
before
trial
for
the
defense
to
reach
federal
court,
we
would
say
exhaustion
shouldn't
be
required.
