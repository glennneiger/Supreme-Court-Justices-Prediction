justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
you
understand
it,
where
does
the
tribe
get
its
tort
law?
does
it
borrow
nevada
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
as
you
understand
the
complaint,
is
the
liability
under
nevada
tort
law
as
borrowed
by
the
tribe,
roughly
coextensive
with
the
liability
under
1983,
other
than
say
for
attorney's
fees?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
tribal
law
borrow
those
caps
as
well,
as
you
understand?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then,
the
liability
is
coextensive
under
the
tort
law
theories
and
under
1983.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
and
the
tribal
court
doesn't
borrow
nevada
law
insofar
as
the
caps
are
concerned,
as
best
you
understand?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
aware
of
any
court
within
the
territory
of
the
united
states
that
can
interpret
42
u.s.c.
1983
without
review
by
this
court?
i
suppose
france
or
england
could
apply
1983
and
we
couldn't
review
their...
are
you
aware
of
any
court
interpretation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
would
that
happen?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
apart
from
removal?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mean
an
injunction
after
the
tribal
court
has
ruled
on
the
issue,
then
you
enjoin
the
tribal
court
because
it's
made
a
mistake
in
interpretation
of
federal
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
more
intrusive--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--than
what
they're
asking
for
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so
under
your
position,
there
is
no
way
to
review
a
ruling
on
a
matter
of
federal
law
given
by
the
tribal
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
your
position
as
to
whether
or
not
a
ruling
on
an
issue
of
federal
law
in
a
tribal
court
in
this
suit
can
be
reviewed
ultimately
in
a
federal
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose,
at
least
so
far
as
i
were
concerned...
and
i
can't
speak
for
my
colleagues...
that
the
case
turned
on
whether
or
not
there
ultimately
could
be
review
in
the
federal
court.
then
i
would
say
you
would
have
to
lose,
because
you
have
indicated
to
me
that
that
review
is
problematic,
or
at
least
reserving
your
position,
and
you're
later
going
to
say
there
is
no
review.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--may
i
just
pursue?
and
that
review
consists
of
an
injunction
for
some
kind
of
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
trial
court,
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--suppose
the
removal
theory
doesn't
work...
is
there
any
other
way
to
review
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
some
kind
of...
what
kind
of
relief?
i've
never
heard
of
such
a
procedure.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
case
really
just
went
to
exhaustion
on
the
jurisdictional
issue.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
exhaustion
doctrine
assumes
that
there
is
some
later
substantive
power
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
the
case,
but
you
question
whether
that
power
ultimately
exists.
you
don't
have
exhaustion
if
there's
not
going
to
be
some
further
jurisdictional
substantive
review.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
is
still
not
clear
to
me
the
theory
on
which
any
such...
any
tribal
court
determinations
on
such
matters
can
be
reviewed
in
any
federal
court.
what
is
the
theory?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
is
it
a
federal
question?
use
federal
question
jurisdiction
to
this--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
wheeler
act...
is
that
the
act...
the
nuclear
power
act...
had
a
specific
provision
for
exclusive
jurisdiction.
we
don't
have
that
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
el
paso
case
was
not
a
removal
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
excuse
me...
there
was
an
underlying
congressional
act
which
gave
exclusive
jurisdiction.
