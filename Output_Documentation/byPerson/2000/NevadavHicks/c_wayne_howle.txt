mr.
c.
wayne
howle
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
make
three
principal
points
this
morning.
the
first
is
that
state
officials
should
not
be
sued
in
tribal
courts.
tribal
jurisdiction
over
state
officials
would
be
inconsistent
with
their
status.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
yes,
your
honor,
as
long
as
they
were
acting
in
a
representative
capacity
for
the
state.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
your
honor,
i--
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is--
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
--the
answer
is
no,
your
honor,
not
in
tribal
court,
but
in
state
or
federal
court,
and
there
is
a
remedy
there.
we're
not
here
to
suggest
that
there's
no
remedy--
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
--the
authority
is--
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
--oliphant,
which
describes
a
divestiture
of
tribal
jurisdiction
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
tribe's
status.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
in
the
case
of
civil
jurisdiction,
the
case
of
national
farmers
union
also
requires
an
examination
of
the
tribe's
sovereignty,
and
to
the
extent
it's
been
divested.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
well,
your
honor,
first
of
all
i'm
not
prepared
to
concede
that
much
regarding
even
a
nonmember
in
a
private
capacity,
but
with
regard
to
state
officials,
there
are
special
considerations.
the
state
officials
are
protected,
we
know,
with
a
certain
immunity
which
has
constitutional
dimensions.
and
our
position
is
that
that
in
conjunction
with
the
court's
instruction
to
examine
the
extent
to
which
tribes
have
been
divested
implicitly
because
of
their
statuses
as
tribes
results
in
the
rule
that
jurisdiction
over
state
officials
has
been
divested.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
we
would,
your
honor.
no
tribal
court
jurisdiction.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
we're
suggesting
a
higher
standard,
and
that
being
acting
in
a
representative
capacity,
and
that's
a
standard
that
we
see
employed,
albeit
in
an
ambiguous
fashion--
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
--that's
a
difficult
case,
your
honor.
i'll
concede,
but
this
is--
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
--that
isn't
this
case,
though.
there's
no
allegation
that
our
officials
acted
outside
of
any
state
authority.
the
only
allegation
regarding
scope
of
authority
is
the
constitutional
violation
alleged,
and
otherwise
the
complaint
alleges
that
they
were
acting
as
game
wardens.
they
do
what
game
wardens
do,
and
they
get
warrants
and
search
for
evidence
of
crime
that
was
committed
off
the
reservation
by
a
reservation
member.
and
this
is
a
core
state
function.
it's
a
peace
officer
function.
nevada
has
to
be
able
to
enforce
its
criminal
laws
within
its
own
borders.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
i
phrase
it
differently,
your
honor.
i
suggest
a
representative
capacity
being
the
standard.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
well,
i
think
that...
i
think
in
that
case
the
analysis
then
falls
back
to
a
different
test,
and
that
being
the
ordinary
test
for
a
private
citizen.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
surely
he'd
be
treated
differently
if
he
were
an
officer,
but
unrelated
to
any
of
the
state
business.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
no,
it
isn't,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
i'll
take
that
position,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
that
officer
would
then
have
to
be
tested
under
the
appropriate
standard
for
a
private
citizen,
and
tribal
jurisdiction
over
private
citizens.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
i'm
sorry?
the
immunity
would
not
attach--
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
first
of
all,
your
honor,
there
is...
i'm
sorry,
i
may
have
misapprehended.
there
isn't
a
statutory
grant
here,
save
for
the
civil
rights
law
of
the
federal
government.
but
our
first
position
is
that
there
is
a
categorical
rule
that
state
officials
doing
state
business
should
not
be
subject
to
the
tribal
court's
jurisdiction.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
not
that...
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
so.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
your
honor,
you're
correct.
the
state
can't
take
over
a
reservation,
but
the
state
carries
on
a
multitude
of
functions
on
reservations
outside
of
those--
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
--i
do
take
that
position,
but
i
acknowledge
that
it's
tentatively
based--
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
--there
is
indeed--
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
i
point
to
the
fact
that
state--
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
--yes,
the
case
of
ex
rel
re
v.
martin,
and
i
believe
mcbrattney
described
the
existence
of
state
criminal
jurisdiction
on
reservations.
it's
not
an
exclusive
jurisdiction
that
the
tribes--
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
--i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i'd
say
it
with
some
uncertainty--
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
--yes.
that
all
is
correct
with
my
understanding,
too.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
the
state
also
has
criminal
jurisdiction
on
reservations
over
a
nonmember
crime.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
i
think
that's
correct.
i
am
tentative
on
that
answer--
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
--i
know
in
this
case
that
the
tribe
would
not
prosecute
that
crime.
i
do
know
that
for
a
certainty.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
state's
physical
jurisdictions
follows
its
legal
jurisdiction.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
correct,
your
honor,
although
i
admit
i--
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
--in
my
reply
brief
on
page
eighteen,
i've
referenced
some
authorities
that
are
indirectly
related
that
establish
a
criminal
jurisdiction
for
the
states
on
reservations.
it's
only
by
reasoning
and
inference
that
i
get
to
the
conclusion
that
we
have
this
authority,
and
if
we
had
not
sought
the
tribal
judge's
approval,
perhaps
we'd
be
here
on
that
issue
as
well.
i
confess
there's...
it's
a
great
area
of
uncertainty,
but
it
is
a
concurrent
jurisdiction
that
the
state
and
the
tribe
have
on
reservations.
reservations
are
still
part
of
the
state,
and
so
the
state
has
to
be
able
to
perform
these
functions
in
order
to
do
its
job
properly
with
law
enforcement.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
exactly.
and
that's
the
position
we
have--
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
--yes.
another
point
we've
made
is
the
way
that
this--
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
--i'm
sorry.
it's
on
page
eighteen
of
my
reply
brief,
in
the
second
paragraph.
the
argument
also
incorrectly
assumes
state
officials
are
powerless
to
pursue
state
law
enforcement
objectives
on
a
reservation,
except
with
the
tribe's
consent.
and
here
i've
identified
the
fact
that
states
do
have
authority
over
off-reservation
crimes
committed
by
tribal
members,
and
that
reservations
are
part
of
the
state
within
which
they
occur.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
that's
correct,
your
honor,
although
we
did
ask
the
tribal
judge
on
both
occasions
out
of
deference
to
the
tribe.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
there
is
federal
statute
on
the
matter.
it
eludes
me
at
the
moment.
certainly
public
law
280
was
a
grant
to
certain
states
of
jurisdiction
on
reservations.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
it
was
in
the
past,
but
it
isn't
now.
all
that
jurisdiction
has
been--
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
--no,
we're
not.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
not
in
this
case,
not
with
this
tribe.
there--
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
--treaties
and
statutes
unique
to
different
tribes,
there's
a
whole--
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
--as
far
as
i
know,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
i'm
sorry?
the
defendant--
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
--your
honor,
that
goes
to
the
question
brought
up
in
u.s.
brief...
i
don't
see
removal
authority.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
there's
no
perfect,
exact
solution.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
that
would
be
a--
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
--i'm
not
aware
of
any
either,
your
honor.
we
spent
three
years
in
tribal
court
arguing
our
immunity
questions.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
we
considered
removal
but
didn't
see
that
it
was
specifically
provided
for
in
the
statutes.
we
also
were
aware
of
the
exhaustion
requirements,
and
we
attempted
to
exhaust.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
maybe
he
can
explain...
or
she,
i'm
sorry.
on
the
question
of
immunity,
we
did
spend
three
years
trying
to
exhaust
this
issue
in
tribal
court,
and
only
then
went
to
the
federal
court
with
an
independent
action.
and
our
position
on
the
immunity
issue
is
that
immunity
is
a
bar
to
suit,
and
it
should
be
decided
when
it's
raised.
and
therefore,
if
the
tribal
court
won't
acknowledge
the
immunity--
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
--it
depends
on
the
claim,
your
honor,
on
a
1983
claim,
assuming
that
there's
one
available
in
tribal
court.
i
guess
that
would
be
a
question
of
federal
law.
the
other
ones
would
be
answered
in
reference
to
the
state
law.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
possibly
so,
your
honor,
although
that
is
a
question
as
well.
the
whole
question
of
whether
1983
is
available
in
tribal
court,
i
think,
is
cast
in
doubt.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
in
the
tribal
court,
your
honor?
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
yes.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
nevada
brought
the
action.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
it
was
an
independent
action
to
enjoin
the
tribal
court
after
three
years
there.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
yes.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
i'm
not
aware
of
language
like
that,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
they
could
be
presented
to
the
court,
your
honor,
and
then
i
think
it
would
be
a
matter
of
comity
for
the
supreme
court
to
consider
whether
or
not
to
acknowledge
those
claims
brought
under
tribal
law.
it
would
be
up
to
the
state
supreme
court,
ultimately,
so
it
would
be
a
question
of
state
law.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
ultimately
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
as
i
understand
it,
yes.
it
does...
it
uses
nevada
law
as
a
guide,
which
makes
it
very
uncertain,
but
it
does
refer
to
nevada
law
quite
often.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
well,
first
of
all
the
state
tort
law
supplies
limits
or
caps
on
claims,
which
aren't
available
under
1983
actions,
so
there
is
some--
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
--as
i
understand
it,
they
would
not,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
if
this
were
in
tribal
court,
your
honor,
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
that's
correct,
although
i
don't
have
an
expressed
statement
from
the
court.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
a
little
of
the
first
and
a
lot
of
the
latter,
your
honor.
there
isn't
law
and
order
code,
but
a
great
deal
of
it,
i
think,
is
just
the
custom
in
practice.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
it
includes
civil
matters,
i
believe,
as
well
as
criminal.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
okay.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
okay,
your
honor.
we
see
a
difficulty
with
the
u.s.
position,
because
it
works
very
well
for
the
federal
civil
rights
claims.
those
are
immediately
removed.
the
difficulty
is
with
tribal
claims,
because
there...
the
u.s.
suggests
there's
a
federal
defense,
but
that--
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
yes.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
unless
there
were
not
a
federal
claim
to
begin
with
in
order
to
remove
it.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
with
your--
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
thank
you,
you
honor.
one
of
our
major
concerns
in
this
case
is
the
non-federal
claim
in
tribal
court,
because
that's
problematic.
the
removal
of
the
non-federal
claim
if
there's
no
federal
claim
to
which
it's
pendent
loses
really
in
tribal
court.
and
even
if
there's
review
of
the
immunity
defense,
ultimately
in
federal
court,
there's
no
basis
for
federal
court
jurisdiction
to
review
the
judgment.
and
so
it
leaves
us
exactly
where
we
started,
which
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
tribal
court.
that
is
a
derogation
of
state
sovereignty.
this
isn't
the
kind
of
treatment
that
the
federal
government
would
accept
for
its
own
officials,
and
the
reference
i
would
make,
if
i
may,
in
the
u.s.
brief
is
footnote
twenty-two
on
page
twenty-nine
where
the
whole
theory
of
federal
officer
immunities
is
set
out.
and
in
the
end
they
conclude,
just
as
we
have,
that
because
of
the
status
of
the
tribes
as
dependent
sovereigns
within
the
federal
system,
additional
considerations
may
apply
to
the
exercise
of
tribal
court
jurisdiction
over
federal
officers
even
when
sued
in
their
personal
capacities.
that's
exactly
what
we're
asking
for
in
this
case
as
state
officers.
we're
not
asking
for
any
more
than
the
federal
government.
and
perhaps
the
difference
here
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
u.s.
views
states
and
tribes
as
coordinate
sovereigns.
coordinate
sovereigns.
and
tribes
and
states
are
not
coordinate
sovereigns,
they're
different.
states
and
tribes
are
fundamentally
different.
state
immunities
have
a
constitutional
dimension,
whereas
tribes
have
been
implicitly
divested
of
their
sovereignty
to
the
extent
that
it's
inconsistent
with
their
status.
and
that's
our
ultimate
position
in
the
case
and
explains
the
position
we
take.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
wayne
howle
thank
you,
your
honor.
