john
paul
stevens
may
i
be
sure
i
understand
your
position...
are
you
saying
that
your
immunity
rule
would
only
apply
when
the
state
official
is
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
authority?
is
that
what
your
position
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
he
goes
beyond
his
representative
capacity
and
does
what
justice
scalia
describes.
would
he
be
immune
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
isn't
this
frolic
of
his
own
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
take
that
position,
what
about
the
case
in
which
the
officer
acknowledges
that
he's
not
on
state
business?
how
about
that
officer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
your
view
is
that
the
immunity
attaches
if
the
officer
acknowledges
that
he
was
not
within
his
state
authority.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
backwards,
yes,
you're
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
correct,
is
it
not,
that
we've
never
held
that
there
must
be
exhaustion
of
anything
other
than
the
jurisdictional
issues?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
would
it
not
have
been
consistent
with
our
cases
for
the
district
court
in
this
case
to
have
said
i'm
going
to
decide
the
qualified
immunity
issue
right
away.
he
didn't
do
that...
it
would
have
been
consistent
with
our
cases
for
the
district
judge
to
have
done
that,
would
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
assume
the
rationale
of
exhaustion
applies
beyond
jurisdictional
issues.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
has
not
been
decided.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it
supports
them
to
the
same
extent
that
it
would
respect
the
sovereignty
of
the
states.
of
course,
if
it
were
a
state
court
involved,
they
would
respect
the
jurisdiction,
require
exhaustion
on
the
jurisdictional
issue,
but
nevertheless
might
have
gone
ahead
on
the
merits,
if
this
were
a
state
court
rather
than
a
tribal
court.
you're
in
effect
asking
for
a
stronger
rule
of
exhaustion
in
tribal
courts
than
if
it
were
a
state
court.
