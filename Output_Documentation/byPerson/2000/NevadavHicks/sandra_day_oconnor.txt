you
mean,
ever,
for
anything,
no
matter
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
comes
to
us
in
the
context
of
a
state
official
who
went
to
the
tribal
court
to
get
authority
to
carry
out
a
search
warrant,
and
was
given
a
warrant
with
certain
terms
and
conditions
to
go
on
the
reservation
and
carry
it
out.
and
if
the
allegation
is
that
the
officer
did
not
follow
the
limitations
in
the
authorized
warrant,
you
think
the
tribal
court
can
never
have
jurisdiction
over
those
actions
of
the
officer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay,
what
is
your
authority
for
this
broad
initial
proposition
you're
making?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
state
has
authority
to
send
its
criminal
law
enforcement
officials
onto
a
tribal
reservation
to
carry
out
state
criminal
law
functions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there's
some
question
about
that,
isn't
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
like
the
right
to
exclude
on
the
part
of
the
tribal
authorities?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
from
the
reservation?
there
is
no...
what
would
you
point
to
for
the
extraordinary
notion
that
the
state
criminal
law
enforcement
officers
have
total
freedom
to
go
on
a
reservation
to
carry
out
criminal
law
functions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
some
law
or
some
case
that
you
can
point
to
for
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
think
it
was
not
necessary
to
get
the
tribal
court's
permission
to
carry
out
a
search
warrant
on
a
house
belonging
to
a
tribal
member
on
the
reservation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
that's
an
unusual
proposition.
do
you
cite
anything
in
your
brief
for
that
proposition?
i
thought
we
took
it
as
a
given
that
the
tribal
court
had
to
authorize
the
search.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
that,
in
effect,
pure
in
nevada?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
you're
not
relying
on
public
law
280?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
petitioner
says
they
didn't
even
need
to
get
tribal
court
permission
to
get
a
search
warrant.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
do
you
rely
on?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
anaya,
we've
gotten
pretty
far
afield,
i
think,
from
what
we
have
to
resolve
in
this
case,
possibly,
and
there
is
remaining,
as
i
understand
it,
a
suit
by
mr.
hicks
against
a
state
official
in
his
individual
capacity.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
some
other
people
too?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
remains.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
official
capacity
suits
have
been
dropped.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
state
says
these
officials
have
personal
immunity
from
that
suit.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
tribal
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
issue
was
raised
by
them
in
the
tribal
court,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
tribal
court
declined
to
what?
rule
specifically
on
the
personal
individual
immunity?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
then
the
state
went
to
federal
district
court
and
said,
you,
federal
district
court,
should
decide
these
issues.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
immediately
after
three
years.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
month.
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
district
court
did
not
deal
with
individual
immunity
allegations?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
by
now
we're
in
the
federal
district
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
district
court
didn't
deal
with
it,
and
then
it
went
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
and
it
didn't
deal
with
that
issue,
either.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
a
1983
action
here,
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
isn't
clear
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
represent
mr.
hicks?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
it
a
1983
action,
or
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
shouldn't
the
federal
court
have
decided
these
issues
of
immunity
of
the
officers
when
it
had
the
case
before
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
did
the
district
court
have
the
power
to
decide
that
issue
when
it
had
the
case
in
front
of
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
tribal
courts
routinely
hear
section
1983
federal
claims?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
about
a
1983
action?
