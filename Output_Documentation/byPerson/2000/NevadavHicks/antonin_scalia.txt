justice
antonin
scalia
--what
does
that
mean?
he
at
least
has
to
believe
that
he's
pursuing
the
state's
business?
suppose
he's
wearing
his
uniform
and
he
just
goes
on
the
reservation
to
beat
up
one
of
the
members
of
the
tribe
that
he
doesn't
like,
but
he's
in
uniform
and
he's
on
duty.
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
i
don't
think
it's
difficult
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
don't
you
go
the
whole
hog
and
say
that
it's
your
position
that
it
ought
to
be
a
question
for
the
state
court
and
not
for
the
tribal
court
whether,
in
fact,
he
was
just
going
in
to
beat
up
a
tribal
member
he
didn't
like,
or
he
was
going
on
state
business.
that's
doubtless
going
to
be
one
of
the
issues
in
the
case,
and
that
whole
case
should
belong
in
state
court
rather
than
tribal
court?
that's
not
an
irrational
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
position
you're
taking?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not
take
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
agree
with
you
on
that
as
to
state
officers
enforcing
the
state's
criminal
laws,
which
is
what
was
at
issue
here,
do
i
have
to
agree
with
you
with
regard
to
all
other
state
officers?
justice
antonin
scalia
professors
at
state
universities?
anybody
else?
i
mean,
there's
a
distinctive
aspect
of
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
law,
and
that
is
that
the
tribe
has
no
authority
to
stop
the
state
from
enforcing
its
criminal
laws
on
the
reservation,
and
one
can
very
plausibly
argue
that
along
with
that
goes
no
authority
to
determine
whether
persons
acting
in
that
criminal
law
enforcement
capacity
have
gone
beyond
the
scope
of
their
authority.
that's
very
rational.
but
i
wouldn't
have
to
extend
that
to
other
state
officers,
would
i?
because
in
the
civil
field
the
state
can't
just
walk
in
and
take
over
the
enforcement
of
civil
laws
on
the
reservation.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
crimes
committed
off...
i
perhaps
put
my
hypothetical
a
little
too
broadly,
but
in
fact
the
tribal
courts
do
not
have
jurisdiction
to
try
for
crimes
committed
off
reservation,
do
they?
if
a
crime
is
committed
off
reservation,
it's
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribal
court,
is
it?
even
if
it's
a
crime
committed
by
a
tribal
member,
or
a
tribe--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
think
it's
pretty
crucial
to
your
case,
and
i
assume
that
to
be
the
case.
i
assume
that
to
be
the
law...
that
the
state
has
the
authority
to
enforce
its
state
criminal
laws
with
regard
to
offenses
committed
off
the
reservation
even
when
that
requires
the
state
to
go
on
the
reservation
to
get
the
culprit.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
up
to
the
tribe
to
enforce
that
law.
it
must
be
up
to
the
state
to
enforce
it.
since
only
the
state
can
enforce
it,
i
assume
the
state
can
go
on
the
reservation.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
certainly
wouldn't
think
that
the
state's
ability
to
enforce
criminal
laws
off
the
reservation
is
going
to
be
dependent
upon
whether
a
tribal
court
will
deign
to
issue
a
search
warrant
or
not.
i
mean,
that
would
be
a
tremendous
incursion
upon
the
state's
sovereignty
that
it
can't
enforce
its
criminal
laws
unless
it
gets
a
tribal
court
to
let
it
go
on
and
search
for
the
offense.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
to
be
pretty
clear
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
did
you
take
that
position,
because
i
didn't
see
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
what
statutes
are
there
concerning
state
criminal
law
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
either
on-reservation
or
off-reservation
crimes?
are
there
some
federal
statutes
that
speak
to
that
issue?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
hard?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
that
as
though
it's
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world.
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
of
course,
removal
would
not
be
an
option...
removal
to
a
federal
court
would
not
be
an
option.
the
whole
matter
would
have
to
be
left
in
tribal
court,
even
though
there
was
an
enforcement
action
with
respect
to
state
criminal
law,
if
a
1983
action
hadn't
been
part
of
the
claim,
if
it
had
just
been
the
tribal
claim
under
tribal
law.
then
you
would
have
been
stuck.
even
on
the
fanciful
reading
of
section
1441,
you
couldn't
get
it
into
federal
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is...
the
tribal
law
is
codified,
or
is
it
just
common
law
developed
by
the
tribal
court,
case
by
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
law
and
order
code
is
civil
actions,
or
just
criminal?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
not
governed
by
its
own
criminal
laws
insofar
as
a
crime
that
occurs
off
the
reservation
is
concerned.
could
this
tribal
court
have
tried
this
crime?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
tribe
can
make
off-reservation
crimes
a
crime
under
tribal
law
triable
in
the
tribal
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
crimes
by
members.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
crimes
against
members.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
if
they
did
make
it
triable
in
tribal
court...
would
the
state
still
be
able
to
prosecute
it
as
a
violation
of
state
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
state's
ability
to
prosecute
is
not
worth
a
whole
lot
if
it
leaves
the
by
your
leave
of
somebody
else
to
go
and
grab
the
person
who
allegedly
did
the
offense.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
you're
saying...
that
the
state
is
entirely
at
the
mercy
of
the
tribal
court
to
get
a
search
warrant,
and
i
presume
an
arrest
warrant
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
quite
an
incursion
on
the
state's
criminal
jurisdiction,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
might
have
been
wrong.
i
don't
know
the
man.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
think
it
was,
and
i
would
have
sat
up,
and
my
eyes
would
have
popped
open.
justice
antonin
scalia
--how
much
of
the
authority
pertains
to
crimes
committed
off
reservation?
justice
antonin
scalia
turtle?
what
else?
that's
a
ninth
circuit
case,
i
gather,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'd
like
the
cite
of
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait...
nevada
highway
patrol.
it's
just
related
to
what?
the
highway
patrol
doing
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
an
accident
that
occurred
on
the
reservation?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
the
understanding
of
the
state
here.
they
had
an
epiphany
or
something.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
in
the
federal
court
system,
as
i
recall
it,
we
allow
the
denial
of
qualified
immunity
to
be
appealed
immediately,
because,
you
know,
the
belief
is
that
the
important
interests
served
by
it
are
simply
defeated
if
you
wait
until
the
whole
litigation
is
finished
before
you
tell
the
governmental
agent,
well,
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
it.
why
should
there
be
a
different
rule
when
we
go
that
far
to
allow
such
an
interlocutory
appeal
in
the
federal
system?
it
seems
very
strange
to
require
the
government
official
to
go
all
the
way
through
the
tribal
court
and
await
an
injunction
afterwards.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
allow
it
immediately
as
soon
as
the
qualified
immunity--
justice
antonin
scalia
--there
are
other
situations
where
we
just
fire
off
injunctions
where
we
think
a
federal
interest
may
be
involved?
do
we
have
authority
to
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
it
sure
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
they
require.
i
mean,
there
are
two
conclusions
that
you
could
draw
from
the
absence
of
any
review
provision
in
the
tribal
court
for
a
1983
action.
one
is
that
we
could
invent
some
never-before-heard-of,
and
never-elsewhere-used
power
of
this
court
or
federal
courts
to
issue
an
injunction.
the
other
one
is
that
the
tribal
court
has
no
authority
to
entertain
1983
actions.
that
would
solve
the
problem
just
as
well,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
your
client's
problem.
i
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
mcdowell,
we'll
hear
from
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree,
but
does
it
exist?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
don't
have
to
have
any
intent
to
leave
it
in
trial
court,
you
need
an
intent
to
get
it
removed
from
tribal
court.
the
extant
state
of
affairs
is
what
it
is.
what
we're
looking
for
is
some
reason
to
remove
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
the
federal
government
have
a
unique
interest
in
law
enforcement?
my
goodness...
it's
not
only
not
unique,
its
interest
in
law
enforcement
is
a
good
deal
less
than
that
of
the
states.
they
do
most
of
the
law
enforcement
in
this
country.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
with
respect
to
state
crimes
that
occur
off
the
reservation.
i
mean,
i
can
see
the
state...
can
i
ask
you?
it
matters
to
me...
it
may
not
matter
to
anybody
else,
but
can
you
resolve
the
conflict
here
as
to
whether
state
officers
are
allowed
just
on
the
basis
of
a
state
warrant
to
enter
a
reservation
to
pursue
a
criminal
from
state
justice
for
a
crime
that
occurred
off
the
reservation?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
respondent
hicks
is
a
member
of
the
fallon
paiute-shoshone
tribes
of
western
nevada
and
lives
on
the
tribes'
reservation.
on
two
occasions,
petitioner
state
game
wardens
executed
state
court
and
tribal
court
search
warrants
to
search
hicks’
home
for
evidence
of
an
off
reservation
crime
namely
the
killing
of
a
protected
species
of
a
big
horned
sheep.
they
found
nothing.
respondent
filed
suit
in
the
tribal
court
against
among
others,
the
wardens
in
their
individual
capacities
and
petitioner
the
state
of
nevada,
alleging
trespass,
abusive
process
and
violation
of
constitutional
rights,
remedial
under
42
u.s.c
section
1983.
the
tribal
court
held
that
it
had
jurisdiction
over
both
the
tribal
tort
and
the
federal
civil
rights
claims
and
the
tribal
appeals
court
affirmed.
petitioners
then
sought
in
federal
district
court,
a
declaratory
judgment,
that
the
tribal
court
lacked
jurisdiction
over
all
the
claims.
the
district
court
granted
hicks
summary
judgment
on
that
issue
and
held
that
the
wardens
would
have
to
exhaust
their
qualified
immunity
claims
in
the
tribal
court.
in
affirming,
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
that
the
fact
that
hicks’
home
is
on
tribe-owned
reservation
land
is
sufficient
to
support
tribal
court
jurisdiction
over
civil
claims
against
nonmembers,
arising
from
their
activities
on
that
land.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
this
case
involves
claims
brought
under
both
tribal
and
federal
law
and
we
address
the
tribal
claims
first.
in
a
case
called
strate
versus
a-1
contractors,
we
held
that
“as
to
nonmembers”
a
tribe's
adjudicative
jurisdiction
does
not
exceed
its
legislative
jurisdiction.
an
antecedent
question
to
a
tribal
court’s
adjudicatory
authority
then
is
the
extent
of
the
tribe's
legislative
authority
and
that
is
governed
by
the
principles
set
forth
in
a
case
called
montana
versus
united
states
to
with,
where
nonmembers
are
concerned,
“the
exercise
of
tribal
power
beyond
what
is
necessary
to
protect
tribal
self
government
or
to
control
internal
relations
is
inconsistent
with
the
dependent
status
of
the
tribes
and
so
cannot
survive
without
express
congressional
delegation."
respondents
and
the
united
states
argue
that
since
hicks’
home
and
yard
are
on
tribe-owned
land
within
the
reservation,
the
montana
test
does
not
apply
and
the
tribe
possesses
plenary
regulatory
authority.
our
reading
of
montana
however
is
that
the
ownership
status
of
land
is
only
one
factor
to
consider
in
determining
the
extent
of
tribal
regulatory
authority
and
while
it
may
sometimes
be
a
dispositive
factor,
the
existence
of
tribal
ownership
is
not
alone
enough
to
support
regulatory
jurisdiction
over
nonmembers.
in
applying
the
montana
test,
it
is
important
to
note
that
in
this
case,
we
are
confronted
with
the
competing
interest
of
the
tribes
and
of
the
state.
our
precedent
makes
clear
that
the
tribal
right
of
self
government
does
not
exclude
all
state
regulatory
authority
on
a
reservation.
the
principle
that
indians
have
the
right
to
make
their
own
laws
and
be
governed
by
them
requires
an
accommodation
between
the
interest
of
the
tribes
and
federal
government
on
the
one
hand
and
those
of
the
state
on
the
other.
when
state
interests
outside
the
reservation
are
implicated,
we
have
upheld
state
regulation
even
if
tribe
members
on
tribe
land
and
it
is
well
established
that
states
have
criminal
jurisdiction
over
reservation
indians
for
crimes
committed
as
was
the
alleging
poaching
in
this
case
off
the
reservation.
several
of
our
cases
discussed
in
greater
detail
in
the
opinion
support
the
proposition
that
this
state
regulatory
jurisdiction
includes
the
concomitant
right
to
enter
a
reservation
to
serve
process
for
enforcement
purposes
and
we
hold
today
that
this
inherent
state
authority
is
sufficient
to
justify
the
search
of
respondent
hicks’
home
and
yard,
without
exposing
the
state
officers
to
suit
under
tribal
law.
the
state’s
interest
in
execution
of
process
is
considerable
and
even
when
it
relates
to
indian
fee
lands
it
no
more
impairs
the
tribe
self
government
than
federal
enforcement
of
federal
law
impairs
state
government.
we
turn
next
to
the
contention
of
respondent
and
the
government
of
the
tribal
court
as
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction
has
authority
to
entertain
federal
claims
under
section
1983.
it
is
certainly
true
that
state
courts
of
general
jurisdiction
can
adjudicate
cases
invoking
federal
statutes
such
as
section
1983,
absent
congressional
specification
to
the
contrary
that
this
would
be
case,
was
assumed
by
the
framers
and
is
presumed
by
article
iii
of
the
constitution
which
leaves
to
congress,
the
decision
whether
to
create
lower
federal
courts
at
all.
this
historical
and
constitutional
assumption
of
concurrent
state
court
jurisdiction
over
federal
law
cases
is
completely
missing
with
respect
to
tribal
courts.
tribal
courts
moreover
are
not
courts
of
general
jurisdiction.
a
state
court’s
jurisdiction
is
general,
and
that
it
lays
hold
of
all
subjects
of
litigation
between
parties
within
it's
jurisdiction
though
the
causes
of
dispute
implicate
the
laws
of
the
most
distant
parts
of
the
globe.
tribal
courts
cannot
be
courts
of
general
jurisdiction,
in
this
sense
for
tribes
inherit
adjudicative
jurisdiction
over
nonmembers,
is
at
most
as
we
have
said
only
as
broad
as
its
legislative
jurisdiction.
the
last
question
before
us
is
whether
petitioners
were
required
to
exhaust
their
jurisdictional
claims
in
tribal
court
before
bringing
them
in
federal
district
court?
since
it
is
clear
that
tribal
courts
lack
jurisdiction
over
state
officials
for
causes
of
action
relating
to
their
performance
of
official
duties,
adherence
to
the
tribal
exhaustion
requirement
in
such
cases
would
serve
no
purpose
other
than
delay
and
is
therefore
unnecessary.
our
decision
today,
does
not
leave
respondent
without
a
remedy
what
we
hold
is
that
state
officials
operating
on
reservation
to
investigate
off-reservation
violations
of
state
law
are
properly
held
accountable
for
tortuous
conduct
and
civil
rights
violations
in
state
or
federal
court
but
not
in
tribal
court.
my

the

chief
