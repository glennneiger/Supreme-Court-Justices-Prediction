we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
99-1792,
the
director
of
revenue
of
missouri
v.
cobank
acb.
mr.
layton.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
from
you
now,
mr.
frederick.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
maybe
congress
has
already
created
that
confusion
by
using
the
term
inconsistently.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
mr.
hanson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
your
opponent
said
that
your
client
continued
to
pay
taxes
to
the
state
of
missouri
from,
what,
1985
to
1995,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
from
1989
to
1995?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--if
your
client
had
never
been
financed
by
the
federal
government,
the
fact
that
it
had
those
priorities
for
distribution
wouldn't
entitle
it
to
any
sort
of
a
tax
exemption,
would
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
does
that
bear
on
its
tax
immunity?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
the
entire
system.
what
are
you
referring
to?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
accommodation
didn't
kick
in
for
35
years.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
kind
of
one
sided
compromise.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hanson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
layton,
you
have
7
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
layton.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-1792,
director
of
revenue
of
missouri
versus
cobank
acb
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
missouri.
cobank
is
the
successor
to
a
bank
for
cooperatives,
which
is
designed
as
a
federally
charted
instrumentality
within
the
farm
credit
system.
in
1996,
cobank
amended
returns
on
behalf
of
this
bank
requesting
an
exemption
from
all
missouri
corporate
income
taxes
and
refunds
on
the
taxes
paid
in
1991
through
1994.
cobank
asserted
that
the
supremacy
clause
accords
federal
instrumentalities
immunity
from
state
taxation,
unless
congress
has
expressly
waived
this
immunity,
and
that
because
the
farm
credit
act's
current
version
does
not
expressly
do
so,
banks
for
cooperatives
are
exempt
from
missouri's
corporate
income
tax.
the
state
denied
the
exemptions,
but
the
missouri
supreme
court
reversed
for
the
reasons
asserted
by
cobank.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse.
the
farm
credit
act
of
1933
subjected
banks
for
cooperatives
to
state
taxation,
except
when
the
united
states
held
stock
in
the
banks.
as
soon
as
governmental
investment
in
the
banks
was
repaid
as
it
was
by
1968,
the
banks
have
to
pay
state
income
taxes
because
the
exemption
no
longer
applied.
congress
did
not
change
that
rule,
when
it
amended
the
act
in
1971,
nor
did
the
1985
amendments
expressly
changed
that
rule,
although
congress
deleted
the
two
sentences
within
the
act
that
exempted
such
banks
from
state
taxation
when
the
government
held
stock
in
them.
the
logical
interpretation
of
this
deletion
and
one
that
accords
with
the
act’s
more
than
50-year
history
is
that
congress
merely
deleted
language
that
had
become
superfluous
once
the
united
states
no
longer
owned
and
no
longer
could
own
stock
in
the
banks
for
cooperatives.
it
would
be
surprising
if
congress
had
eliminated
the
state’s
ability
to
collect
revenue
from
such
banks
sub
silentio.
the
act’s
structure
confirms
that
banks
for
cooperatives
are
subject
to
state
taxation,
because
it
contains
the
taxation
provision
that
specifically
delineates
the
tax
immunity
for
each
lending
institution
within
the
farm
credit
system.
had
congress
intended
to
confer
upon
banks
for
cooperatives,
the
more
comprehensive
exemption
it
provided
for
other
types
of
institutions,
it
would
have
done
so
expressly.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
