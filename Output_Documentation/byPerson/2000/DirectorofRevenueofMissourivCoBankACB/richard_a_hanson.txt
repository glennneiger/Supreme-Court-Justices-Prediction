mr.
richard
a.
hanson
perhaps
i
could
clear
that
up,
your
honor.
in
the
first
place,
the
bank
was
not
formed
until
1989,
so
that
we
obviously
didn't
have
any
liability
prior
to
that
date.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
the
bank
did,
in
fact,
pay
tax,
and
fairly
promptly,
beginning
with
the
year
1991
filed
refund
claims
to
recover
that
tax.
i
would
submit
that
to
the
extent
that
they
were
slow
in
making
those
claims,
it
might
have
had
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
the
entire
farm
credit
system
had
more
serious
problems
to
worry
about
in
the
late
1980's
which
was,
frankly,
its
survival.
one
point
that
all
parties
seem
to
agree
upon,
and
certainly
the
court's
opinions
make
this
clear,
is
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
an
entity
is
entitled
to
immunity
as
a
federal
instrumentality
is
up
to
congress.
the
court
said
that
in
the
new
mexico,
the...
missouri
said
that
in
their
briefs,
the
solicitor
general,
of
course,
said
the
same
thing.
what
we
now
have
here,
we
would
submit,
is
a
case
where
congressional
designation
as
a
federal
instrumentality
somehow
carries
less
weight
than
a
judicial
determination
of
federal
instrumentality.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
well,
let
me
go
through
the
history
briefly
of
the
banks
for
cooperatives,
because
i
think
that
answers
your
question.
they
were
formed
in
1933.
at
that
time,
if
you
look
at
decisions
like
james
v.
dravo
corporation,
to
be
a
federal
instrumentality
meant...
and
i
don't
think
there
would
have
been
any
dispute,
that
you
were
exempt
from
federal
income
tax
absent
an
affirmative
authorization.
the
banks
were,
and
the
farm
credit
act
was
then
in
1971
completely
recodified
and
congress
again
affirmatively,
not
merely
carry
over,
but
affirmatively
said,
the
banks
for
cooperatives
are...
continue
to
be
federally
chartered
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states.
that's
1971.
they
did
that
at
a
time
when
the
federal
government
owned
no
stock
in
that
entity,
and
they
said
the
reason--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--to
invest
in
the
stock.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
what
changed
in
1985
is
that
the
form
of
potential
government
investment
changed,
and
it
changed
not
because
of
some
sense
of
a
difference
in
the
structure
of
these
entities,
it
changed
because
congress
determined
that
a
centralized
entity,
the
farm
credit
capital
corporation,
could
serve
a
number
of
warehousing
and
centralized
financing
functions,
and
it
would
then
become
the
entry
point
for
federal
investment.
so
what
we
have
is,
in
effect,
instead
of
the
money
going
directly
to
the
bank
for
cooperatives,
it
would
go
to
the
capital
corporation,
which
would
then
provide
it
to
the
banks
for
cooperatives,
and
i
would
submit
that
that's--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--it
would
be
a
loan,
and
if
you
look
at
the
statute,
it's
a
subordinated
loan.
it's
subordinated
to
all
of
the
debt
of
the
system.
it's
subordinated
to
the
capital
provided
by
the
members.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
it's
still
not
equity,
i
would
agree,
but
if
you...
i
mean,
if
you
were
trying
to
value
the
debt
versus
the
equity
and
compare
their
security
and
their
claims
on
the
assets,
i
think
you
would
find
that
there
very
little
distinction.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
the
income
goes...
the
income
of
the
bank
is
used
for
four
purposes,
and
these
are
provided
in
the
statute.
the
first
purpose
is
to...
and
i'll
do
this
in
the
context
of
1991,
which
is
the
first
year
before
the
court.
the
first
use
is
to
rebuild
the
capital
of
the
bank,
because
you
can't
function
as
a
lender
without
capital
to
provide
security
to
your
bond
holders.
the
second
use...
and
this
is
all
set
out
in
section
2132
with
respect
to
bc's.
the
second
use
is
to
rebuild
loss
reserves,
or
to
make
sure
that
loss
reserves
are
adequate.
these
are
both
things
that
are
necessary
for
the
bank
to
function.
the
third
use,
of
course,
in
these
years
is
to
pay
back
the
government
loan
and,
as
we
indicated
in
our
brief,
the
bank
for
cooperatives
national
bank
and
its
successor,
cobank,
paid
back
something
like
$300
million.
none
of
those
things
actually
affect
earnings.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
but
it's
not
the
bank's
income,
either.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
it
is
the
members'
income.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
that's
the
very
nature
of
a
cooperative.
i
mean,
a
cooperative
is--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--the
fourth
would
be,
and
this
is
because
we
are
a
cooperative,
would
be
a
distribution
to
our
member
borrowers
according
to
the
business
they
did
with
the
bank,
not
according
to
their
capital,
and
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
kiowa
county,
the
purpose
for
that
distribution
is
not
a
purpose
to
return
an
investment
to
the
borrower.
it's
to
reduce
the
cost
of
his
loan,
because
one
of
the
fundamental
missions
of
the
farm
credit
system,
again
as
this
court
has
recognized,
is
to
provide
loans
for
farmers
at
the
lowest
possible
cost.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
no,
but
i
think
they
make
the
point
that
the
bank
itself
is
not
a
for
profit
entity.
it
is
a
cooperative.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
well,
it
bears
on
why
congress
would
give
the
bank
a
designation
as
a
federally
chartered
instrumentality
of
the
united
states.
the
mission
of
the
farm
credit
system...
it's
set
out
in
the
statute,
it's
been
recognized
in
your
cases,
is
to
provide
secure
and
adequate
lending
to
agricultural
borrowers
at
the
lowest
possible
cost.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
right.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
well,
i
don't
think
congress
was
any
less
sensitive.
if
you
go
back
to
1933,
when
the
banks
were
formed,
it
was
obviously
the
depression,
and
congress
did
what
the
court
acknowledges
that
it
does.
it
balanced
the
interests
of
a
federal
program
to
provide
secure
and
adequate
and
inexpensive
financing
to
farmers
with
the
fact
that
the
states
were
also
suffering
from
the
depression,
and
so
the
compromise
that
was
struck
in
depression
conditions
was,
you
can't
tax
these
entities
as
long
as
there's
a
federal
investment,
but
we
will
let
you
tax
them
when
that
investment
is
retired.
as
missouri
itself
put
it
in
its
brief,
they
said,
you
know,
if
the
federal
government
has
an
investment
in
the
bank...
an
investment
here
cannot
realistically
turn
on
whether
it
is
equity
or
debt.
i
mean,
in
either
case,
as
i
suggested
earlier,
the
terms
are
such
that
it's
a
federal
claim.
they
said
the
states
ought
to
be
understood
to
have
to
stand
aside
until
that's
paid
back.
what
changed
in
1985
is,
congress
recapitalized
the
system.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
right.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
well,
i
mean,
certainly
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
suggests
that
that
analysis
was
undertaken.
i'm
not
saying
that
congress
might
not
have
thought
it
through
that
way,
but
going
back
to
what
justice
breyer
was
asking
me
about
the
profits
and
income
of
a
bank,
there
is
no
source
to
pay
back
the
united
states,
except
the
income.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
right.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
right.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
they
clearly
could
under
the
statute,
because--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--i
apologize,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
that's
correct.
that's
what
it
says.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
well,
and
the
answer
is
that
the
legislative
history
from
1933--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--makes
it
very
clear.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
that
congress
was
very
clear
about
that.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
i
understand
where
you're
going.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
well,
and
let
me
qualify
part
of
my
answer,
is
that
the
statute
has
been
understood
by...
it's
never
been
construed
by
this
court,
but
it's
been
understood
by
a
number
of
state
courts
and...
consistent
with
what
congress
said.
they
said,
what
we
are
writing
with
that
third
sentence
is,
not
that
we...
we
won't
tell
you
what
happens
when
there's
no
ownership,
but
we
are
telling
you
affirmatively
that
you
become
taxable.
now,
was
it
artful
language?
perhaps
not.
so
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
exemption...
that
the
taxability
previously
existed
by
negative
implication.
i
think
it
was
statutory
and,
of
course,
the
answer,
what
happened
in
1985
was,
the
statute
was
repealed.
now,
both
the
exemption,
i
agree,
and
the
negative
implication.
one
thing
here
that
i
think
the
court
needs
to
focus
on,
and
it's
a
major
point
made
by
the
state
and
by
the
solicitor
general,
is
they...
citing
rosello
and
cases
like
that,
they
say,
well,
the
farm
credit
banks
have
an
exemption,
and
the
farm...
the
federal
land
bank
associations
have
an
exemption,
and
you
don't
have
an
exemption
therefore,
and
i
grant
that
that's
a
perfectly
valid
rule
of
statutory
construction.
but
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
someone
ought
to
at
least
offer
a
reason
why
it
makes
sense
that
congress
would
discriminate
against...
differentiate.
they're
not
discriminating...
differentiate
between
a
bank
for
cooperatives
which
makes
loans
to
an
agricultural
cooperative
or
production
credit
association
which
makes
a
loan
to
a
farmer.
it's
also
a
property,
but
it's
otherwise
identical,
and
a
federal
land
bank
association
makes
the
same
loan,
and
they've
clearly
granted
a
statutory
exemption
in
the
one
case
but
not
the
other.
now,
you
know--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--well,
i
mean,
i
think
congress
is
normally
presumed
to
legislate
on
a
rational
basis
and
have
a
reason
for
what
it's
doing.
my
point
is,
and
particularly
from--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--well,
i
certainly
agree
with
your
honor
on
that
point,
but
1985...
and
there
is
this
change,
and
we
pointed
it
out
in
our
brief,
that
when
the
banks
formed
in
1933
and
through
1971,
in
effect
they
were
a
stand
alone
element
in
the
farm
credit
system.
they
issued
their
own
bonds.
they
made
their
own
loans.
they
were
liable
only
for
their
own
bonds
and
for
their
own
operations.
from
1975
through
1985
the
entire
system
became
interlocking
in
terms
of
issuance
of
bonds
and
liability
therefore,
and
the
operation
of
all
the
banks,
so--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--well,
i'm
talking
about
the
major
legs
of
the
farm
credit
system,
the...
what
were
originally
the
federal
land
banks
and
are
now
the
farm
credit
banks,
the
production
credit
associations,
and
the
banks
for
cooperatives.
those
have
always
been
the
three
lenders.
but
in
1985
cobank
is...
or,
national
bank
for
cooperatives...
i'm
sorry,
1989...
is
no
longer
simply
liable
for
its
own
operations.
it
doesn't
issue
its
own
bonds.
its
taxability
doesn't
affect
only
it.
now
it
affects
everybody
else,
because
if
missouri
can
tax
it,
it
has
less
income
to
put
into
the
pool
to
pay
back
the
government.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
i
mean,
the
national
banks,
which,
of
course,
have
always
been
viewed
and
designated
as
federal
instrumentalities,
the
statute
now
tells
you
what
to
do.
the
other
types
of
lending
institutions,
you
know,
in
the
first
place
they're
not
designated
as
federally
chartered
instrumentalities.
again--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--well,
then
i
guess
i
would...
that's
one
way
of
looking
at
it,
but
it
seems
frankly
implausible
to
me.
i
mean--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--because
the
government...
i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
the
government...
and
again,
this...
part
of
the
problem
that
we
have
with
this
is,
we
recognize
that
there
were
distinctions
made
between
the
banks.
the
federal
land
banks,
which
were
originally
capitalized--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--that
congress
would
make
that
determination
with
respect
to
the
banks
for
cooperatives,
but
it
wouldn't
make
that
determination
with
respect
to
the
other
banks.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
it
does
not
own
stock
in
the
other
banks.
it
originally
capitalized
the
federal
land
banks,
which
had
been
before
this
court
numerous
times.
but--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--no,
and--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--those
statutes...
their
statutory
exemption
continued
after
the
government's
stock
was
retired.
it
was
not
made
conditional,
as
the
banks
for
cooperatives
exemption
was,
as
it
appears
to
us,
because
when
the
banks
were
formed
in
1933,
that
was
a
political
calculation
that
congress
made.
they
said,
the
states
are
desperate
for
revenue,
and
while
we
need
to
accomplish
this
program,
we're
willing
to
make
this
accommodation.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
that's
right.
it
did
not
kick
in
until
the
late
1960's,
and
that
accommodation--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--well...
i
mean,
partly
that
goes
to
the
nature
of
farming.
you
offered
to
buy
the
bank,
and
i
suspect
i
have
members
who
would
happily
sell
it
to
you.
but--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
there
is
that
differentiation.
but
it
comes...
it
all
comes
down
to
1985,
and
did
congress
change
the
rules,
and
we
suggest
that
the
law
before
1985
was,
we
are
exempt
as
long
as
the
federal
government
has
an
investment,
and
technically
in
the
stock
of
the
bank,
and
i
understand
that.
in
1985,
congress
says,
we
have
to
provide
a
line
of
credit
to
this
entire
system
to
keep
it
from
falling.
it
managed
in
2
years
to
lose
40
percent
of
the
capital
it
had
accumulated
over
7
years.
and
not
only
are
we
going
to
do
that,
but
we're
going
to
make
the
whole
thing
interlocking
in
terms
of
how
it
functions,
and
we're
doing
all
of
this
because
the
bank
is
critical,
because
the
commercial
banks
will
not
lend
to
agriculture
in
times
of
stress...
congress
said
that
in
1633
in
'87...
and
because
the
farmers
are
suffering
from
interest
rates
that
they
have
to
pay
to
the
farm
credit
system,
which
in
large
part
was
a
function
of
the
cost
of
borrowing
in
the
capital
markets,
because
the
capital
markets
had
lost
confidence
in
the
banks,
so
we
had--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--well,
you
know,
the
state
has
suggested
that
that
is
the
reference
in
the
committee
report
which
describes
this
change,
and
we
would
submit
that's
not
true
for
two
reasons.
first,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
the
committee
report
refers
to
a
version
of
the
bill
which
did
not,
in
fact,
establish...
it
did
not,
in
fact,
repeal
the
second
sentence.
it
repealed
only
the
third.
i
understand
that's
a
two
edged
sword,
but
they
say
it's
only
a
technical
and
conforming
amendment
when
what
congress
was
doing
was
repealing
only
the
third
sentence
of
the
act,
which
would
leave
us
with
a
complete
exemption,
so
i
don't
know
that
you
can
prove
too
much...
i
don't
know
if
i'm
being
clear
about
that.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
yes,
it
was,
basically.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
well,
i
think
there
are
two
answers
to
that,
and
first
is,
as
we've
pointed
out,
you
know,
this
legislation
started
out,
as
legislation
does,
with
hearings
and
worrying
about
governmental
regulation,
and
farmers
complaining
about
the
cost
of
borrowing,
and
by
the
time
it
got
into
the
system
in
november,
the
question
was
whether
or
not
you
could
save
the
farm
credit
system,
because
it
turned
out
that
it
was
basically
hemorrhaging
money.
and
congress,
the
bill
was
introduced
on,
i
think,
the
20th
of
november,
and
it
was
signed
by
the
president
on
the
18th
of
december.
i
mean,
this
went,
bang,
bang,
bang.
it
was
described
in
the
wall
street
journal
as
legislating
on
the
fly.
they
were,
you
know,
as
the
wall
street
journal
would
be
very
offended
by
that.
but...
so
you
have...
you
have
a
lot
of
very
high
priority
concerns
that
congress
was
trying
to
deal
with
and
articulate
and
explain,
and
then
you've
got
this
state
tax
exemption
which
i'm...
and
liability,
which
is
clearly
important
to
missouri,
i've
no
doubt
about
that,
but
on
a
list
of
priorities,
i
doubt
that
it
was
very
high
when
congress
was
concerned...
as
the
comments
on
the
floor
indicate,
they're
worried
about
losing
the
entire
system,
and...
but
i
think
the
second
point,
and
again,
in
19...
i
know
i'm
repeating
about
this
point,
but
in
19...
prior
to
the
change,
the
statute
said
that
the
bank
was
exempt
as
long
as
the
federal
government
owned
stock
in
the
bank.
after
1985,
if
you
accept
our
interpretation,
we
are
saying
that
the
bank
is
exempt
because
the
federal
government
has
reinfused
capital,
admittedly
in
a
different
form,
but
certainly
not
financially,
economically
different,
and
in
a
form
for
which
the
banks
were
liable,
so
that
i
would
submit
that
the
only
difference
between
the
circumstances
in
1984
and
1986,
if
you
will,
is
that
in
the
first
place
congress
was
being
explicit,
and
in
the
second
place
congress
was
relying
upon--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--that
designation.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
well,
i
don't
understand,
and
i've...
we've
never
accepted
this
notion
that
somehow
we
have
a
bigger
exemption.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
but...
well,
not
even
equal,
because
previously
we
were
exempt
from
federal
income
tax.
subsequently
we're
not
exempt
from
federal
income
taxes,
and
in...
i
mean,
and
that's
fairly
significant.
now,
you
can
say,
well,
doesn't
that
undercut
the
notion
of
lending
at
the
lowest
possible
cost?
the
answer
is,
i
think
the
government
is
sort
of
indifferent
whether
it
gets
its
money...
in
paying
back
the
loan
whether
it
gets
its
money
from
taxes
or
gets
a
loan
repayment,
and
in
fact
the
banks
were
never
truly
exempt
from
federal
tax
because
they
were...
even
when
they
were
exempt
from
federal
income
tax
the
statute
imposed
a
franchise
tax
based
on
net
earnings,
which
is
functionally
equivalent,
so
in
that
sense
the
status
quo
was
maintained,
and
i
think
that's
our
argument.
the
status
quo
was
maintained.
the
design
was
maintained.
the
facts
changed,
and
under
the
circumstances,
and
given
the
pressure
congress
was
under,
i
think
it's
entirely
rational
that
they
would
look
at
this...
i
mean,
the
bill
came
out
of
the
house
on
the
6th
of
december.
it
was
passed,
completely
changed
and
passed
by
both
houses
on
the
10th.
i
think
it's...
you
know,
it's
asking
a
bit
much
to
expect
a
nice,
detailed
explication
of
all
the
provisions.
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
it
is...
it's
taxable
because
the
internal
revenue
code
provides
that
it
would
be
taxable
absent
an
express
exemption,
and
there
is
none,
so
it's...
entities
have
always
been
subject
to--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--no.
the
code
refers
to
federal
instrumentalities
and
tells
you
how
to--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--that
they
are
exempt...
i'm
sorry,
that
they
are
taxable
absent
an
express
exemption
in
the
income
tax
law.
it's
501(c)(1).
so...
you
know,
so
the
presumption,
the
pattern
is
opposite
for
a
federal
tax.
you're
taxable
unless
there's
a
statutory
exemption.
here,
and
i'd
like
to
simply
conclude
by
where
i
started.
if
you
look
at
the
new
mexico
decision
which
missouri
relies
upon
at
length,
and
you
go
to
page
736,
and
i
pick
this
out...
this
is
illustrative.
you
were
talking
about
whether
those
particular
federal
contractors
were
exempt
from
state
tax,
and
you
said,
the
court's
other
cases
describing
the
nature
of
a,
quote,
federal
instrumentality.
that
is
a
term
of
art.
it's
been
a
term
of
art
since
justice
marshall
first
coined
it
in
mcculloch
v.
maryland,
and
the
one
attribute
that's
always
been
associated
with
a
federal
instrumentality
in
this
court's
cases
is
an
exemption
from
state
taxation
absent
a
waiver.
i
mean,
i've
looked...
i
can't
claim
that
i...
this
is
complete.
the
court
has
never
held
that
an
entity
which
is
a
federal
instrumentality
is
taxable
in
the
absence
of
an
affirmative
congressional
authorization,
whether
you're
talking
about
the
department
of
employment,
you're
talking
about
new
mexico,
you're
talking
about
graves,
you're
talking
about
james
v.
dravo,
never,
at
least
not
that
we
can
find.
that
term
carries
with
it
that
attribute,
and
we
submit
that
congress,
in
designating
us
a
federally
chartered
instrumentality,
consistent
with
what
we
do...
they
didn't
do
it
haphazardly...
intended
precisely
the
same
designation,
and
we
would
suggest
that
that
also
fits
with
the
overall
goals
of
congress
in
passing
the
1985
act
and
rescuing
the
farm
credit
system
and
trying
to
give
the
agricultural
borrowers
some
relief
from
high
interest
rates.
it
seems
to
us
it
all
fits
together,
and
what
the
state
is
literally
saying
is,
well,
we
want
to
act
like
the
law
didn't
change,
that
there
was
no
repeal.
well,
there
was
a
repeal.
the
law
did
change,
and
the
question
is,
did
congress
intend
that
we
become
taxable
without
regard
to
the
federal
investment,
or
did
they
intend
that
we
become
exempt
under
the
mcculloch
rule,
and
those
are
basically
the
choices
facing
the
court.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
richard
a.
hanson
--thank
you,
your
honor.
