would
you
amend
your
answer
to
say,
anything
the
government
calls
an
instrumentality?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
we
have
some
cases
that
say
that
if
you
call
it
a
technical
amendment,
then
we
can
go
back
behind
the
intention
of
the
congress
as,
treat
it
as
something
of
a
different
order
than
a
straight
out
repealer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
is
it
your
principal
submission
that
we
should
look
at
the
act
in
its
pre-1985
status?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
implausible...
you
were
finishing
your
answer.
it
seems
implausible
to
you
because?
