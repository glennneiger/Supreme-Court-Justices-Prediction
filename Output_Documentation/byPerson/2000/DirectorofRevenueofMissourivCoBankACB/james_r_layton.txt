mr.
james
r.
layton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1933,
when
congress
authorized
the
organization
of
banks
for
cooperatives,
it
implicitly
authorized
the
states
to
tax
them.
that
authority
became
effective
for
each
bank
when
it
retired
the
government
shares.
the
national
bank
for
cooperatives
paid
taxes
to
missouri
until
1995,
but
according
to
the
missouri
supreme
court
the
bank's
tax
liability
ended
in
1985.
that
court
failed
to
recognize
the
bank's
exemption
from
taxes
is
and
always
has
been
provided
by
statute,
and
that
statute,
now
12
u.s.c.
2134,
exempts
from
taxation
only
the
bank's
notes,
debentures,
and
other
obligations,
not
its
income.
in
deciding
what
section
2134
means,
the
missouri
supreme
court
erred
in
three
respects.
it
transformed
a
technical
and
conforming
amendment
into
a
significant
change
in
the
farm
credit
act,
it
made
that
transformation
by
adding
to
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
and
it
turned
the
statute
into
something
that
is
incongruous
to
the
rest
of
the
farm
credit
act.
before
1985,
the
statute
provided
that
cobank
and
its
predecessors
would
always
pay
taxes
on
real
and
tangible
personal
property
and,
at
any
time
when
the
government
did
not
own
shares,
they
would
pay
other
taxes
to
state
and
local
governments
and
perhaps
even
to
the
federal
government.
the
question
arises
here
as
to
what
happened
in
1985,
and
the
position
being
taken
by
cobank
is
that
in
1985
suddenly
they
were
freed
from
all
taxes,
and
yet
that
is
not
what
the
statute
said
in
1985.
there
was
a
technical
and
conforming
amendment
that
appeared
in
title
2
of
the
1984...
5
act.
title
2
was
the
part
of
the
act
that
was
dedicated
to
making
the
farm
credit
administration
an
arm's
length
regulator
for
the
farm
credit
system,
something
more
akin
to
what
we
see
at
the
fdic
and
other
bank
regulators
in
the
federal
system.
title
1
of
that
act
also
included
conforming
amendments.
title
1
dealt
with
the
credit
corporation
which
cobank
cites
here
as
a
new
vehicle
for
investment
into
the
farm
credit
system.
the
second
point
that
the
missouri
court
erred
on
is
transforming
the
plain
language
by
adding
to
it.
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
is
simply
that
this
entity
is
exempt
from
taxation
as
to
its
notes,
debentures
and
other
obligations.
ever
since
1933,
the
entire
scope
of
the
exemption
given
to
the
banks
for
cooperatives
has
been
contained
in
statutes.
the
only
thing
that
anyone
can
point
to
in
the
statute
today
that
goes
beyond
notes,
debentures,
and
obligations
is
the
reference
to
this
entity
as
a
federal
instrumentality,
but
this
court
has
at
various
times
suggested
or,
in
fact,
held
that
federal
instrumentality
does
not
have
the
kind
of
meaning
that
cobank
ascribes
to
it.
mr.
james
r.
layton
from
the
very
beginning,
your
honor,
and
that's
significant,
because
even
in
1933,
what
rights
or
abilities
a
federal
instrumentality
had
was
unclear.
certainly--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--that's
right.
mr.
james
r.
layton
that's
right.
mr.
james
r.
layton
that's
right.
mr.
james
r.
layton
well--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--well,
i
think
that's
what
they
say.
that
isn't
what
we
would
say.
mr.
james
r.
layton
we
would
say
that
they're
not--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--that's
right,
and
this
court,
and
in
fact
congress
has
never
suggested
that
there
could
be
this
kind
of
a
hybrid
provision
for
exemption.
in
each
of
the
instances
where
we
have
a
financial
institution
that
seeks
an
exemption
from
taxes,
congress
has
either
defined
the
whole
scope
of
that
exemption,
or
left
it
blank.
mr.
james
r.
layton
well,
first
off
that...
the
mcculloch...
well,
mcculloch
holds
that
a
federal
instrumentality
cannot
be
taxed
discriminatorily
and
in
fact
goes
beyond
that
to
say
you
can't
import...
impose
certain
kinds
of
taxes.
mcculloch,
however,
does
not
suggest
that
anything
that
might
be
labeled
a
federal
instrumentality
qualifies.
mr.
james
r.
layton
that's
a.
mr.
james
r.
layton
yes.
mr.
james
r.
layton
that
mcculloch
is
restricted
to
an
instrumentality
of
the
type
that
this
court
addressed
in
the
new
mexico
case,
and
we
can
see
the
comparison
fairly
bluntly
here.
the
second
bank
of
the
united
states
was
run
by
presidential
appointees.
the
federal
government
owned
20
percent
of
the
shares
in
that
bank,
and
that
bank
performed
governmental
functions,
not
just
functions
in
which
the
government
had
an
interest,
but
it
actually
issued
currency.
it
did
things
that
the
government
itself
must
do.
in
that
sense,
the
second
bank
of
the
united
states
was
a
little
like
the
red
cross
that
this
court
addressed
in
the
department
of
employment
case.
again,
presidential
appointees
run
the
red
cross,
and
that
entity
fulfills
treaty
obligations
that
the
united
states
assumed
under
the
geneva
convention.
the...
cobank
mentions
the
rural
telephone
bank
in
their
brief.
well,
the
rural
telephone
bank
has
a
13-member
board
of
directors.
seven
of
them
are
appointed
by
the
president
of
the
united
states.
the
governor
of
the
rural
telephone
bank
is
appointed
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
and
there
is
a
direct
appropriation
from
congress
in
a...
over
a
10-year
period
of...
or
20-year
period
of
$600
billion
for
the
rural
telephone
bank.
by
contrast,
here
we
have
an
entity
that
from
the
beginning
has
been
controlled
by
a
board
of
directors
that
is
appointed
by
its
voting
shareholders,
which
did
not
include
the
united
states.
that
is,
by
the
borrowers.
it
has
always
been
a
private
entity,
quite
distinct
from
the
things
that
we
see
in
mcculloch.
so
what's
the
distinction
from
mcculloch?
mcculloch
holds
that
if
you
have
something
that
is
an
instrumentality
of
the
type
that
is
the
second
bank
of
the
united
states,
then
in
fact
there
is,
absent
any
congressional
language,
immunity.
mr.
james
r.
layton
and
that's
certainly
true.
mr.
james
r.
layton
yes.
mr.
james
r.
layton
well,
it
may
or
may
not
drive
up
that
cost.
it's
interesting
to
look
a
little
at
the
history
of
what
happened
here.
in
1933--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--assuming
it
does,
assuming
that
it
does
drive
up
the
cost,
then
that
would
certainly
affect
the
ability
of
these
entities
to
fulfill
that
interest
in
which
the
government
has
an
interest,
yes,
it
would.
mr.
james
r.
layton
no,
it
is
not.
it
is
not.
if
that
were
enough,
then
anything
that
congress
creates
within
its
power
and
says
it
has
a
governmental
interest
could
be
exempted,
or
inherently
exempted
from
state
tax.
mr.
james
r.
layton
well,
no.
i
don't
know
that
the
government
has
to
call
something
an
instrumentality
in
order
to
give
it
the
exemption
under
that
approach.
again,
instrumentality
doesn't
have
a
meaning
that
is
precise
as
cobank
wishes
that
it
did.
mr.
james
r.
layton
no.
there
was
no
statute
in
mcculloch
that
referred
to
a
tax
exemption,
and
that
is
one
of
the
distinctions.
mr.
james
r.
layton
as
far
as
i
know,
it
did
not.
mr.
james
r.
layton
no.
mr.
james
r.
layton
i...
there's
no
mention
in
the
case
suggesting
that
it
did,
and
that
matters
in
the
sense
that...
well,
not
just
that
it
didn't
use
that
phrase,
but
there's
no
exemption
statute
at
issue
in
mcculloch.
that
is,
congress,
when
it
created
the
second
bank
of
the
united
states,
didn't
say,
okay,
you
have
the
following
exemptions
from
state
and
local
taxes,
but
that's
what
congress
at
least
since
1916,
when
it
started
the
farm
credit
system,
has
done
consistently
for
the
financial
entities
within
the
farm
credit
system.
mr.
james
r.
layton
well,
it's
curious
that
they
make
that
claim
in
a
brief
where
they
also
cite
the
memphis
case
in
section
742
of,
i
believe
it's
title
31,
which,
if
this
entity
is
part
of
the
united
states,
that
is,
if
this
bank
of
cooperatives
has
the
inherent
authority
that
they
ascribe
to
it,
then
742
would
cover
them,
and
this
provision
would
be
superfluous
in
2134.
but
it
doesn't
cover
them,
because
they
are
not
an
instrumentality
of
this
sort,
and
congress
has
defined
the
scope
of
their
authority.
in
1928,
this
court
in
the
shaw
v.
gibson
zahniser
oil
case,
just
a
few
years
before
the
1933
act
that
created
the
bank
for
cooperatives,
pointed
out
that
there
are
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states
that
do
not
have
exemptions
unless
congress
gives
them
an
exemption,
and
then
5
years
later
congress
in
this
instance
defines
what
the
exemption
is,
and
what
cobank
and
what
the
missouri
supreme
court
have
done
is
to
say,
well,
that
definition
by
congress
doesn't
really
matter.
the
third
point
that
i
mentioned
was
that
it
turns
the
statute
into
something
in
congress
with
the
rest
of
the
farm
credit
act.
that
is,
in
each
instance
in
the
farm
credit
act,
where
congress
has
created
an
entity
that
is
even...
that
is
analogous
to
this
particular
one,
congress
has
said,
okay,
here
is
the
kind
of
exemption
that
you
have
from
state
and
local
taxes.
it
always
is
a
comprehensive
statement,
and
does
not
leave
room
for
some
kind
of
an
argument
that
there
is
an
additional
exemption
based
on
some
kind
of
inherent
immunity,
and
in
each
instance
it
permits
taxation
of
real
property
and
in
many
instances
taxation
of
tangible
personal
property.
and
one
of
the
differences
that
occurred
in
1985,
according
to
cobank,
is
all
of
a
sudden
the
statute
changed
from
allowing
state
and
local
governments
to
tax
tangible
personal
property
to
including
only
a
real
property
exemption
which
they
ascribe
back
to
the
dicta
in
mcculloch.
in
fact,
there
may
be
a
problem
with
tangible
personal
property.
i'm
not
sure
how
much
of
that
cobank
would
be
likely
to
foreclose
upon,
but
the
same
statutory
language
is
used
for
the
production
credit
associations,
and
it
is
easily
understood
that
there
would
be
tractors
and
other
equipment
that
they
would
foreclose
upon
that
would
justify
the
need
for
a
provision
for
taxation
on
tangible
local...
tangible
personal
property.
mr.
james
r.
layton
no.
there
are
a
couple
of
cases
cited
in
our
brief
that
stand
for
the
proposition
that
we
don't
expect
congress
to
use
technical
amendments
to
make
this
kind
of
a
change,
but
neither
of
them
actually
says,
yes,
we
can
then
go
back
behind
the
language
to
determine
what
congress
did.
but
here
you
don't
have
to
go
behind
the
language
to
committee
reports
or
something
like
that.
just
look
at
what
the
language
was.
if
congress
wanted
to
do
what
cobank
now
says
they
did,
all
they
had
to
do
was
eliminate
the
last
sentence
in
the
prior
statute.
that
is,
the
sentence
that
said,
okay,
here's
the
point
at
which
the
state's
authority
to
tax
begins.
if
that
had
been
the
scope
of
the...
of
congress'
action,
just
eliminating
that
last
sentence,
then
except
for
the
tangible
personal
property
question
cobank
would
have
today
exactly
what
they
wanted,
but
that
sentence
says,
okay,
the
exemption
that
we
are
giving
you
in
the
prior
sentence...
that
is,
you
don't
have
one
until
we
give
it
to
you.
the
exemption
we
are
giving
you
in
the
prior
sentence
is
going
to
apply
only
to
a
certain
point.
and
when
congress
acted
here,
they
took
out
not
just
the,
okay,
it
applies
at
a
certain
point,
but
exemption
that
they
had
given,
and
so
today
there
is
no
exemption
in
the
statute,
and
the
banks
for
cooperatives
are
responsible
for
paying
taxes
to
state
and
local
governments.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
r.
layton
i'll
note
first
that
i
believe
that
the
banks
for
cooperatives
were
subject
to
federal
income
tax
prior
to
1985,
but
i'd
also
note
the
franchise
tax
that
counsel
referred
to.
in
the
1971
act
in
section
4
it
sets
out
a
franchise
act
that
could
be
as
high
as
25
percent
of
net
income
for
the
banks,
but
interestingly,
that
franchise
tax
applied
so
long
as
the
government
holds
shares
in
the
bank,
and
that
the
government
didn't
hold
any
shares
at
that
point,
and
there
was
obviously
an
incentive,
given
that
franchise
tax,
not
to
allow
the
government
to
pick
up
any
shares
in
your
particular
bank.
i
should
note
also
that
although
the
national
bank
for
cooperatives
was
formed
in
1989,
it
was
the
merger
of
other
banks
for
cooperatives,
and
there
have
been
banks
for
cooperatives
operating
in
missouri
for
many,
many
years
prior
to
1989.
turning
to
the
legislative
history,
if,
indeed,
we
have
to
get
to
the
legislative
history,
the
history
does
talk
about
the
reasons
for
the
1985
act,
and
one
of
the
things
that's
there
is
a
note
that
the
banks
for
cooperatives
themselves
were
healthy.
this
was
not
prompted
by
a
problem
with
the
banks
for
cooperatives.
it
was
prompted,
as
mr.
hanson
accurately
said,
by
a
system
wide
problem.
that
is,
there
may
have
been...
there
were
other
entities
within
the
bank,
the
farm
credit
system
that
were
having
enough
problem
that
it
was
bringing
down
the
ability
of
the
entire
system
to
sell
bonds,
and
yet
the
argument
being
made
here
is
that
because
some
other
entity
had
a
problem
and
congress
created
a
system
wide
remedy,
that
is
a
remedy
that
would
provide
federal
financing
to
the
system
as
a
whole,
and
never
to
particular
institutions,
that
somehow
these
banks
for
cooperatives
attained
a
new
exemption.
before,
they
only
had
an
exemption
when
they
had
federal
investment.
afterward,
according
to
cobank,
they
all
have
an
exemption
even
if
no
one
has
a
federal
investment,
and
the
most
that's
likely
is
that
some
production
credit
association
or
someone
else
would
have
an
investment,
and
yet
somehow
they
get
this
exemption
back.
they
also...
the--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--well--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--i
think
one
reason
is
to
ensure
that
that
entity...
in
the
tax
context
one
reason
is
to
ensure
that
that
entity
cannot
be
subjected
to
discriminatory
taxation.
missouri,
for
example,
could
not
pass
a
tax
that
was
restricted
to
the
income
of
federally
charter...
or,
excuse
me,
of
cooperative
banks
that
serve
cooperatives,
farm
cooperatives.
because
the
only
one
that
exists
is
this
instrumentality,
that
would
be
aimed
at
a
federal
instrumentality
and
would
be
a
discriminatory
tax
and
it
would
be
illegal,
because
that
is
a
federal
instrumentality.
there
may
be
other
reasons
as
well,
but
certainly
that
is
one
impact
of
use
of
that
term.
the
change
that
is
alleged
to
have
come
about
in
1985
is
not
just
to
remove
the
connection
between
the
federal
investment
and
the
bank
that
is
asserting
the
exemption,
but
also
to
remove
the
temporal
aspect.
that
is,
before,
the
exemption
only
was
in
place
while
the
federal
investment
was
in
place.
at
the
time
in
1985
there
was
5-year
sunset
provision
on
the
credit
corporation
through
which
the
funds
that
mr.
hanson
spoke
of
would
be
channeled,
and
yet
the
exemption
that
he
asserts
is
one
that
would
exist
indefinitely.
that's
inconsistent
with
the
legislative
history
and
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
cobank
poses
the
question
as
to
why
differentiate
between
production
credit
associations
and
banks
for
cooperatives
on
the
one
hand
and
other
institutions
such
as
land
banks
on
the
other,
and
we
shouldn't
have
to
ask
that
question,
because
congress
made
that
determination
in
1933.
there
has
always
been
a
distinction.
we're
just
discussing
today
what
the
distinction
now
is.
but
there
are
a
couple
of
possible
reasons
for
congress
to
have
made
that
distinction.
one
is
simply
temporal.
in
1933
we
were
in
the
depression
era,
and
not
only
was
there
a
problem
with
the
farm
credit,
with
credit
for
farmers,
but
there
was
a
problem
with
banks
generally,
and
so
here
congress
was
setting
up
some
institutions
that
would
compete
with
commercial
banks
that
themselves
were
failing
throughout
rural
areas
in
the
united
states,
and
congress
set
up
a
system
that
said,
okay,
for
the
time
being,
we
will
give
you
an
advantage
over
your
commercial
competitors,
but
only
for
the
time
being.
at
some
point
it's
going
to
go
back
to
where
you
do
not
have
that
extent
of
commercial
advantage.
sure,
you
can
still
issue
obligations
that
will
be
tax
free,
but
you
won't
be
able
to
avoid
tax
entirely.
another
reason
that
there
may
be
a
distinction
is
that
the
land
banks
that
mr.
hanson
referred
to
lend,
as
i
understand
it,
based
on
the
farmer's
land
as
collateral,
and
there
has
always
been
a
feeling
in
congress
that
we
don't
want
to
take
the
land
away
from
the
farmers.
that
is
distinguishable
from
the
question
of
lending
based
on
their
crops,
which
is
what
a
production
credit
association
would
do,
or
based
on
the
equipment
and
land
that
is
held
by
a
cooperative
that
may
be
producing
or
processing
the
crops
or
otherwise
providing
services
for
the
farmers.
there
is
a
distinction.
it's
worth
noting
that
today
between
two
thirds
and
three
quarters
of
agricultural
lending
in
the
united
states
is
done
by
entities
outside
of
the
farm
credit
system,
and
those
entities
must
compete
on
the
grounds
that
congress
set
forth,
and
not
on
the
grounds
that
can
be
divined
by
some
reference
to
past
history.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
thank
the
court.
