--well,
i
guess
on
the
side
of
your
opponent
is
the
fact
that
these
banks
were
created
to
perform
an
important
governmental
function
by
extending
reliable
credit
to
farmers
at
the
lowest
possible
cost.

right?
i
mean,
that
was
an
important
governmental
interest.

and
by
subjecting
them
to
taxation,
it's
going
to
drive
up
that
cost.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
assuming
it
does--
justice

o'connor
--is
that
enough,
then,
to
exempt
them
from
that
interest?
