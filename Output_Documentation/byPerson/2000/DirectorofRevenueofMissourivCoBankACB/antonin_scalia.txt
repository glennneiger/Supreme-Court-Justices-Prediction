justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
statute
in
mcculloch
say...
use
the
term,
instrumentality
of
the
united
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
mean,
but
the
statute
creating
the
bank
of
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
it
call
it
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
my
recollection
is
that
it
didn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
fourth
purpose?
you
said
there
were
four...
four
things
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
other
two--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
you
were
done.
finish
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
the
other
banks...
this
was
my
question.
does
the
government
own
stock
in
the
other
ones?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
could
not
explain
the
difference
on
the
ground
that
the
government
is
a
participating
investor
in
the
others--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
a
formal
sense,
whereas
it
is
not
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
does
show
the
government
was
willing
to
treat
cobank
differently
then,
and
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
government
isn't
willing
to
treat
it
differently
now,
just
as
then
you
say
the
other
instrumentalities,
even
though
the
government
was
no
longer
a
participating
investor,
would
continue
to
have
their
exemption,
that
was
not
the
case
for
cobank.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
always
been
treated
differently
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
frederick,
what
is
the
effect
of
congress'
calling
an
institution
a
federal
instrumentality?
i'd
always
thought
that
the
primary
reason
they
do
that
is
precisely
to
exempt
it
from
state
income
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
other
effect
does
it
have?
why
would
you
enact
a
statute
that
says,
you
know,
the
red
cross,
or
whatever
it
is,
is
a
federal
instrumentality?
