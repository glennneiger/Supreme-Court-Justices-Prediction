justice
david
h.
souter
it
has,
i
take
it,
been
described
as
such
by
statute
from
the
very
beginning.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
but
the
lowest
possible
cost
argument
would
not
have
washed
before
the
'85
amendment,
because
before
the
'85
amendment
it
was
very...
as
i
understand
the
statute
it
was
very
explicit.
that
even
though
you
could
reduce
the
cost
by
rendering
the
bank
nontaxable,
you
would
only...
or
the
bank's
income,
you
would
only
do
that
if
the
united
states
was
in
part
an
owner.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
once
the
united
states
dropped
out,
we
didn't
care
whether
it
made
the
loans
more
expensive.
why
would
there
be
a
different
policy
in
effect
now
from
the
policy
in
effect
then?
why
did
we
become...
why
did
congress
become
more
sensitive
to
cheap
loans
after
'85
than
before?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
congress
was
saying
before
1985,
as
long
as
we
are
an
owner,
our
interest
comes
before
the
state
interest.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
isn't
necessarily
a
cheap
loan
policy.
it's
a
favor
the
united
states
policy.
justice
david
h.
souter
therefore,
there's
no
need
to
favor
the
united
states,
and
therefore
there's
no
need
to
provide
a
nontaxable
policy.
at
each
time,
before
'85
and
after
'85,
the
united
states'
policy
with
respect
to
the
effect
of
the
cost
of
borrowing
on
borrowers,
on
this
analysis,
would
be
exactly
the
same.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
only
thing
that's
changed
is,
we
don't
have
the
united
states
in
an
equity
position
to
favor
any
more,
therefore
there's
no
need
to
provide
for
nontaxability.
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
look
at--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
mean,
that's
why...
not
everyone
agrees,
but
i
like
to
look
at
legislative
history,
and
you
would
have
expected,
given...
even
cooperative
banks
at
that
time,
they'd
have
lawyers
who
were
doing
this,
and
if
they
thought
that
in
removing
words
that
grant
an
exemption
the
intent
was
to
give
an
even
bigger
exemption,
i
would
certainly
think
somewhere
somebody
would
have
said
something.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
equal
to.
justice
david
h.
souter
could
you
go
to
the
reason
for
the
tax,
the
federal
income
taxability?
is
it
taxable
under
a
special
statute
that
says,
cobank,
pay
federal
income
taxes
now,
or
is
it
taxable
simply
because
there's
no
express
exemption
for
cobank?
justice
david
h.
souter
does
the
code
refer
specifically
to
this
bank?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
