mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
is
that
banks
for
cooperatives
under
the
farm
credit
act
are
not
exempt
from
state
income
taxes
for
two
reasons.
we
think
the
court
should
confine
its
decision
to
an
analysis
of
the
text
of
the
farm
credit
act,
and
not
go
beyond
it
to
discuss
or
address
the
constitutional
issues
relating
to
federal
instrumentalities.
under
the
text
of
the
act
itself
there
are
two
reasons
why
banks
for
cooperatives
are
not
exempt
from
state
income
taxes.
first,
as
the
state
counsel
noted,
at
section
2134,
the
first
sentence
itself
just
addresses
an
exemption
for
notes,
debentures,
and
obligations.
that
provision
contrasts
with
two
other
provisions
of
the
farm
credit
act
that
specifically
give
state
income
tax
exemptions
for
other
entities
of
the
farm
credit
system.
12
u.s.c.
2023
provides
an
exemption
from
state
income
taxes
for
farm
credit
banks
and
provides
expressly
that
congress
intended
for
those
entities
to
be
exempt
from
state
income
taxes.
moreover,
12
u.s.c.
2098
provides
an
express
exemption
from
state
income
taxes
for
federal
land
bank
associations.
it's
clear,
therefore,
that
when
congress
enacted
this
statute,
and
it
amended
it
over
a
50-year
period,
it
knew
precisely
how
to
give
the
kind
of
exemption
from
state
income
taxes
being
asserted
by
respondents
in
this
case
and
chose
not
to
do
so.
secondly,
the
history
behind
this
provision,
as
the
state
counsel
made
perfectly
clear,
does
not
support
respondent's
position.
between
1933
and
1985,
the
text
itself
provided
for
the
exemption
from
state
income
taxes
only
in
any
part
of
a
year
in
which
the
government
owned
stock.
that
ended
in
1968.
from
a
period
between
1965
and
1968,
the
government
retired
all
of
its
shares
of
stock
in
banks
for
cooperatives.
so
as
of
1968,
and
this
is
reflected
in
the
farm
credit
administration's
annual
report,
banks
for
cooperatives
were
not
exempt
from
federal
and
state
income
taxes.
when
congress
made
its
amendment
nearly
two
decades
later,
in
the
1985
farm
credit
amendments
act,
there
was
no
government
ownership
in
any
banks
for
cooperatives.
these
were
completely
privately
owned
for
profit
entities
and,
as
such,
would
have
been
subject
to
state
income
taxes
throughout
the
entire
period.
now,
the
last
point
that
i'd
like
to
make
is
that
the
court
should
not
reach
out
to
opine
about
instrumentality
status
generally.
this...
the
court
consistently
under
the
farm
credit
act
has
looked
at
the
text
of
the
act
to
determine
the
scope
of
exemptions
from
taxation,
and
that's
true
in
all
of
the
cases
that
have
been
cited
by
the
parties
under
the
farm
credit
act.
it
should
not
use
this
case
to
opine
broadly
about
what
instrumentality
status
means
for
several
reasons.
first,
congress
uses
the
term,
instrumentality,
in
a
broader
range
of
contexts,
and
even
in
this
case
and
in
this
statute
itself,
has
used
it
to
describe
not
only
the
organizations
that
are
being
used
to
facilitate
congress'
purpose,
but
also
the
financial
instruments
themselves.
section
2023,
which
is
the
farm
credit
bank
tax
exemption
provision,
describes
the
notes
themselves
as
the
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states,
and
so
by
making
a
decision
about
what
instrumentality
status
means,
the
court
could
end
up
having...
could
create
unintended
consequences
that
would
affect
the
taxable
status
of
instrumentalities
throughout
the
government.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
certainly
an
area
that
congress
would
certainly
want
to
address.
the
question,
though,
is,
by
using
that
term,
and
i
would
give
a
second
reason,
and
that's
that
congress
imposes
certain
obligations
on
agencies
and
instrumentalities
that
are
apart
from
tax
questions,
reporting
obligations
for
data
to
the
secretary
of
commerce,
encouraging--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
justice
stevens.
what
the
court
would
say
is
that
use
of
the
instrumentality
language
by
itself
would
not
render
the
rest
of
the
tax
exemption
language
in
the
farm
credit
act
surplusage,
and
the
court
would
say
that
congress
defined
the
scope
of
the
tax
exempt
status
of
these
particular
instrumentalities
by
expressly
dealing
with
tax
exempt
status,
and
that's
how
the
court
did
it
in
the
first
agricultural
bank
case
in
1968,
when
it
addressed
a
very
similar
question
for
the
national
banks,
and
there
the
court
said,
we're
going
to
look
at
the
text
of
the
statute
to
determine
the
scope
of
the
exemption
and
not
reach--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct,
where
there
is
express
tax
exempt
language
given
by
congress.
i
mean,
even
in
mcculloch
itself
the
court
said
that
it
was
up
to
congress
to
decide
how
it
wanted
to
exercise
its
powers
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
we
think
that
the
'85
language
which
is
present
here
is,
in
and
of
itself,
sufficient,
but
it
is
also
supported
by
the
history
of
the
statutory
evolution
from
1933,
which
makes
perfectly
clear
congress
did
not
intend
for
these
entities
to
be
tax
exempt
when
the
government
did
not
own
shares
in
them.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
