justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
don't
we
have...
isn't
the
statute...
as
i
understand
the
statute,
it
used
to
say,
your
bonds
are
exempt
and
your
income
is
exempt
as
long
as
the
stock's
being
held
by
the
board
of
governors.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
they
get
rid
of
the
second
part
because
nobody
holds
the
stock
any
more.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
we're
left
with
the
first
part.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
you
rather
brilliantly
say
is,
ha
ha,
that
means
mcculloch
clicks
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
since
mcculloch
clicks
in,
since
it
doesn't
say
it
doesn't,
they're
exempt
anyway
as
a
federal
instrumentality.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
that's
what
they
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly,
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
given
that's
their
argument,
and
given
we're
left
with
the
remnant,
why
doesn't
mcculloch
click
in?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
obvious
reason...
one
obvious
reason
would
be
because
they're
not
a
federal
instrumentality.
that's
a.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
is
there
a
second
argument
lurking
here,
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
what
i'm--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
only
tax
the
income
earned
equity,
don't
you?
i
mean,
basically
the
income
of
the
bank
is...
the
income
goes
to
the
equity
holder,
doesn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
i
mean,
my
point
is
simply,
if
i
own
your
bank...
you
might
be
very
nice...
i
would
expect
the
state
to
tax
the
income,
but
if
the
government
owns
the
bank,
probably
it
wouldn't,
and
that's
what
the
statute
seemed
to
say.
and
then
in
'85
the
government
doesn't
own
the
bank
any
more.
it
lends
money
to
the
bank.
well,
so,
why
would
you
expect
the
state
not
to
be
able
to
tax
the
income?
it
isn't
the
government's
any
more.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
whose
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
my
question
is
actually
the
same
as
justice
souter's,
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
probably
just
going
to
put
it
in
a
slightly
different
way,
but...
you
have
three
sentences
in
this
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
first
sentence
that
says
no,
no
tax
on
bonds,
all
right.
the
second
said,
no
tax
on
income,
and
the
third
one
said,
sentence
2
applies
only
when
we're...
the
government's
an
investor.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
just
out
of
curiosity,
let's
suppose
that
was
still
the
statute.
we're
back
in
'84.
why
can
the
state
tax
a
bank's
income
even
where
the
government
doesn't
have
an
investment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
what
do
you
mean,
it
clearly
could...
wait--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's...
the
point
is,
the
statute
doesn't
say,
it
can't.
the
statute
nowhere
says
that
it
can
or
it
can't.
what
the
statute
says
is,
it
can't
as
long
as
the
government
has
an
interest.
it
doesn't
say
what
happens
when
the
government
interest
disappears.
all
it
says
is
that
the
preceding
sentence
exemption
doesn't
apply
when
the
government
interest
disappears.
that's
what
my
version
says.
it
says,
the
exemption
provided
in
the
preceding
sentence
shall
apply
only
when
the
government
is
an
owner.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now
the
government
isn't
an
owner.
therefore
the
preceding
sentence
doesn't
apply.
why
doesn't
mcculloch
apply?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
you're
saying,
there's
a
negative
implication.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
now,
once
you
say
there
was
a
negative
implication
before,
why
doesn't
that
same
negative
implication
exist
after
'85,
from
the
first
sentence,
unless
there's
something
in
that
'85
history
that
shows
that
what
they
wanted
to
do
was
restore
mcculloch,
and
my
reading
is
there
isn't
a
word
on
that,
but
you're
prepared
to
say
it
wasn't
the
statute
before
that
wiped
out
mcculloch.
you're
saying
what
wiped
out
mcculloch
before
was
a
negative
implication
from
the
statute,
and
so
my
question
is
simply,
why
isn't
that
negative
implication
still
there,
just
as
strong
as
it
ever
was,
unless,
of
course,
you
can
point
to
a
reason?
now
do
you
see
my...
you
see
where
i'm
going?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
that's
what
i'd
like
the
answer
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
all
true,
but
are
there
some
other
kinds
of
banks
that
are
very
similar
that
missouri
can't
tax?
you're
not
saying
there's
some
other
very
related
kind
of
bank
that
missouri
cannot
tax?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
isn't
the
obvious
answer
to
your
question,
what...
you
say,
well,
the
government's
thought
was,
while
we're
the
owner,
missouri
can't
tax
us,
but
once
we're
no
longer
the
owner,
because
we
don't
own
stock,
then
it
can,
and
if
that
raises
the
price
of
credit,
so
be
it.
i
mean,
isn't...
that's
what
it
seems
to
say.
