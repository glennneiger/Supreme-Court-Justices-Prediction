yes,
but
mr.
frederick,
isn't
it
true
that
for
purposes
of
deciding
this
case,
if
we
have
to...
if
we
rule
in
your
favor
and
the
favor
of
the
petitioner,
we
must
decide
that
the
mere
fact
that
it's
labeled
an
instrumentality
is
not
sufficient
to
give
a
tax
exemption?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
we
would
at
least
have
to
say
that
the
mere
fact
they
have
used
the
term
instrumentality
is
not
sufficient
to
overcome
the
statutory
argument.
