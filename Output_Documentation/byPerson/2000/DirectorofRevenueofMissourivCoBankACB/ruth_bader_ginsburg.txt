mr.
layton,
there's
a
reason
that
the
other
side
gives
for
the
exemption
of
the
debt
obligations,
because,
they
say,
those
obligations
are
held
not
in
the
hands
of
cobank
but
in
the
hands
of
the
lenders,
so
you
need
an
exemption
so
that
those
lenders,
who
are
private
and
not
government
instrumentalities,
won't
be
taxed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
question
is
was
there
really
any
congressional
determination,
considering
that
when
one
thing
we
know
for
sure
from
'68
to
'85,
congress
meant
these
entities
to
be
subject
to
income
tax,
and
they
were.
what
happened
in
'85?
what
congress
meant
is
far
from
clear.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
still
a
provision
for
the
government
to
come
back
and
use--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
infusion
would
be
a
loan
type--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it's
still
not
up--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
doesn't
that
text
take
care
of
it?
if
you
take
the
position
that
there's
no
inherent
exemption
for
this
kind
of
organization,
that
you
have
three
organizations,
and
for
two
of
them
congress
has
provided
expressly
your
income
is
exempt,
and
for
one
of
them
it
hasn't,
so
why
isn't
the
assumption
just
from
the
text
that
two
of
them
have
it
and
one
of
them
doesn't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
in
the
tax
area
congress
could
shed
its
grace
where
it
will.
[laughter]
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--congress
said
all
this
in
a
technical
and
conforming
amendment,
but
nothing
to
suggest
that
they
meant
to
do
anything
more
than
get
rid
of
the
obsolete
provision
that
referred
to
the
government's
ownership.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
puzzles
me
is
if
the
tax,
the
state
tax
was
on
from
'68
to
'85.
if
congress
was
saying,
stop,
states,
you
would
expect
that
to
be
something
that
people
would
stand
up
and
take
notice
of,
and
yet
there's
not
anything
explicit
to
suggest
that
congress
meant
to
take
away
from
the
states
the
tax
authority
that
they
had
for
this
and
the...
what
is
it,
the
pca's
as
well?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
it
meant
to
take
that
away
from
the
states.
