justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
olson,
suppose
a
less,
a
less
controversial
federal
benefit
scheme,
let's
say
the
scheme
that
says
states
can
get
highway
funds
if,
if
they
hold
their
highway
speeds
to
a
certain
level,
all
right?
and
suppose
you
have
a
state
supreme
court
that
in
your
view
unreasonably
interprets
a
state
statute
as
not
holding
highway
speed
to
the
level
required
in
order
to
get
the
benefit
of
that
safe
harbor.
would
you
think
that
that
raises
a
federal
question
and
that
you
could
appeal
the
state
court
decision
here
because
it
deprived
the
state
of
the
benefit
of
the
highway
funds?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
this
any
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
just
talk
about
section
5.
i
mean,
the
constitutional
question's
another
one.
why
is
section
5
in
that
regard
any
different
from
the
highway
funding?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
read
their
opinion
that
way,
mr.
olson.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
portion
of
their
opinion
dealing
with
statutory
construction
ends
with
a
conclusion
that
the
secretary
has
discretion.
the
portion
of
the
opinion
employing
the
canons
of
construction
does
not
place
any
limits
upon
the
secretary's
discretion.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
not
on
the
basis
of
any
canons
of
statutory
construction.
that
was
on
the
basis
of
the
state's
constitution.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
olson,
did
section
15
exist
when
mcpherson
was
decided?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
make
a
difference,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have
to
separate
your
statutory
argument
from
your
constitutional
argument.
to
the
extent
that
you
are
relying
just
on
the
constitution,
do
you
think
that
congress
could
by
section
15
exclude
the
courts
from
adjudicating
the
constitutionality
of
what
the
state
has
done?
justice
antonin
scalia
your
position
is
so
long
as
it's
different,
it
violates
section
5
and
therefore
we
have
a
right
to
step
in?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
is
a
federal
court
what
are
you
here
for,
if
you're
not
addressing--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
too
late...
it's
too
late
to
lengthen
the
time
for
the
contest.
i
mean,
to
the
extent
that
they
have
shortened
the
contest
time,
you
know,
that's
water
over
the
dam
right
now,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
not
the
case
that
if
the
votes
are,
are
as,
as
they
have
been
shown
to
be
under
the
florida
supreme
court's
opinion,
the
race
is
much
closer,
and
therefore
some
counties
under
florida
law
would
conduct
recounts
that
otherwise
would
not
conduct
recounts.
doesn't
whether
a
recount
is
conducted
depend
upon
how
likely
it
is
that
the
recount
is
going
to
change
the
outcome?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
secretary
took
the...
never
mind.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
and
that
advice
was...
and
this
was
really
the
beginning
of
all
of
the
problem,
her
advice
was
that
the
provision
providing
for
recounts,
manual
recounts,
not
requiring
them
but
giving
them
as
one
of
the
options,
only
came
into
play
when
there
was
some
defect
in
the,
in
the
machinery,
and
it
was
not
available
for
voter
error,
that
is
for
voters
who
didn't
punch
the
cards
the
way
they
were
supposed
to.
and
the
attorney,
your
office
came
out
with
the
opposite
conclusion.
the
secretary's
brief
contends
that
that
had
always
been
the
rule
in
florida.
is
that
the
case?
do
you
know
of
any
other
elections
in
florida
in
which
recounts
were
conducted,
manual
recounts,
because
of
an
allegation
that
some
voters
did
not
punch
the
cards
the
way
they
should
have
through
their
fault?
no
problem
with
the
machinery...
it's
working
fine.
you
know,
there
were
what,
pregnant
chads,
hanging
chads,
so
forth?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
that
ever
happen--
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
section
that
requires
manual
recounts?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
different
from
requires.
justice
antonin
scalia
then--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
no.
it's
required
to
do
one
of
three
things,
one
of
which
could
be
a
manual
recount.
it
could
decide
to
do
one
of
the
other
two
instead.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there
is
really...
there
is...
i
mean,
the
court
says
that
there
is
a
requirement
for
a
manual
recount
but
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
text
of
the
statute
that
requires
a
manual
recount.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that
is
a
statutory
problem,
the
court's
resolution
didn't
really
solve
it,
did
it?
because
even
with
her
extended
time
period
the
same
statutory
problem
exists.
there
still
isn't
enough
time
under
the
extended
deadlines
for
some
of
these
counties
that
have
an
enormous
number
of
votes
to
conduct
a
manual
recount,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
to
resolve
a
supposed
conflict
in
the
statute
in
a
manner
that
leaves
in
place
the
same
problem
that
existed
before
seems
to
me
not
a
real
resolution
of
the
statutory
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
in
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief,
i'm
sure,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
tribe,
i
don't...
i
don't
agree
with
that.
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that
the
florida
supreme
court
used
the
florida
constitution
as
a
tool
of
interpretation
of
this
statute.
if
you
look
at
its
opinion,
it's
separated
into,
into
various
sections,
issues;
iv,
legal
opinion
of
division
of
elections;
v,
the
applicable
law;
vi,
statutory
ambiguity;
and
that's...
and
vii,
legislative
intent.
that's
the
section
where
they
construe
the
statute
in
view
of
these
ambiguities
and
so
forth.
that
section
concludes,
under
this
statutory
scheme,
the
county
canvassing
boards
are
required
to
submit
their
returns
to
the
department
by
5
p.m.
of
the
seventh
day
following
the
election.
the
statutes
make
no
provision
for
exceptions
following
a
manual
recount.
if
a
board
fails
to
meet
the
deadline,
the
secretary
is
not
required
to
ignore
the
county's
returns,
but
rather
is
permitted
to
ignore
the
returns
within
the
parameters
of
this
statutory
scheme.
so
what
the
statutory
interpretation
gives
you
is
a
firm
termination
date
of
december
7th
and
discretion
in
the
secretary.
the
opinion
continues,
viii,
the
right
to
vote.
the
text
of
our
florida
constitution
begins
with
a
declaration
of
rights.
and
it
goes
on
to
say
that
to
the
extent
the
legislature
may
enact
laws
regulating
the
electoral
process,
those
laws
are
valid
only
if
they
impose
no
"unreasonable
or
unnecessary"
restraints
on
the
right
of
suffrage
contained
in
the
constitution.
in
other
words,
i
read
the
florida
court's
opinion
as
quite
clearly
saying,
having
determined
what
the
legislative
intent
was,
we
find
that
our
state
constitution
trumps
that
legislative
intent.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
other
way
to
read
it,
and
that
is,
that
is
a
real
problem,
it
seems
to
me,
under
article
ii,
because
in
fact
there
is
no
right
of
suffrage
under,
under
article
ii.
there
is
a
right
of
suffrage
in
voting
for
the
legislature
but
article
ii
makes
it
very
clear
that
the
legislature
can
itself
appoint
the
electors.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
that's
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
in
a
separate
section
of
the
opinion,
professor
tribe,
that
is
entitled
the
right
to
vote.
it
is
after
the
legislative
intent
section
and
it
says
categorically,
to
the
extent
the
legislature
may
enact
laws,
they
are
invalid.
and
i
suggest
perhaps
the
reason
that
the
court
did
it
is
that
however
expansive
the
doctrine
of
constitutional
doubt
is,
there
is
no
way
that
it
can
make
december
7
mean
anything
except
december
7.
i
mean,
they
were
almost
constrained
to
use
the
constitution
to
override
the,
the
firm
deadline--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
was
explicitly
set
forth
in
the
constitution.
justice
antonin
scalia
--professor
tribe,
i
would
feel
much
better
about
the
resolution
if
you
could
give
me
one
sentence
in
the
opinion
that
supports
the
second
of
these
supposed
alternative
readings,
that
supports
the
proposition
that
the
florida
supreme
court
was
using
the
constitutional
right
to
vote
provisions
as
an
interpretive
tool
to
determine
what
the
statute
meant.
i
can't
find
a
single
sentence
for
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
bother
with
it
because
having
decided
very
clearly
what
the
statute
requires
and
finding
no
way
to
get
around
the
firm
dates
set,
you
say
the
reason
it's
bad
is
because
of
the
state
constitution.
that's
how
it's
written.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
might
have
tried
it
another
way,
but
it
seems
to
me
they
didn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
professor
tribe,
can
i
ask
you
why
you
think
the
florida
legislature
delegated
to
the
florida
supreme
court
the
authority
to
interpose
the
florida
constitution?
i
mean,
i...
maybe
your
experience
with
the
legislative
branch
is
different
from
mine,
but
in
my
experience
they
are
resigned
to
the
intervention
of
the
courts,
but
have
certainly
never
invited
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
makes
you
think
the
florida
legislature
affirmatively
invited
the
florida
supreme
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
are
resigned,
that
they
are
resigned
to,
but
they
need
not
be
resigned
to
the
florida
supreme
court
interposing
itself
with
respect
to
federal
elections,
they
need
not
be
because
the
florida
constitution
cannot
affect
it.
and
i...
i
just
find
it
implausible
that
they
really
invited
the
florida
supreme
court
to
interpose
the
florida
constitution
between
what
they
enacted
by
statute
and
the
ultimate
result
of
the
election.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
are
already
different
deadlines
for
federal
elections,
aren't
there,
because
of
the
federal
statute
concerning
overseas
ballots?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that's,
that's
going
to
be
different
anyway.
