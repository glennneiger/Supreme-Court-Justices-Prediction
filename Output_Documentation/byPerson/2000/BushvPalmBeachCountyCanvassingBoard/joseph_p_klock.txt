mr.
joseph
p.
klock
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
argument
is
simply
addressed
to
issues
having
to
do
with
florida
law,
and
the
point
being
raised
by
the
secretary
is
this,
that
the
law
in
the
state
of
florida
on
november
7
was
changed
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida's
decision
on
november
21.
the
secretary
is
not
contesting
the
right
of
the
florida
supreme
court
to
change
the
law
of
florida,
is
simply
pointing,
she
is
simply
pointing
out,
that
the
law
did
change.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
under
florida
law,
she
has
certain
discretion
that
i
think
a
court
probably
does
not
have
in
the
protest
period,
justice
kennedy,
and
that
would
be
that
she
had
the
discretion
to
decide
whether
or
not
returns
could
be
permitted
after
that
seventh
day,
and
indeed
that's
based
on
two
things
that
we
have
in
the
record.
one
is
an
opinion
that
was
issued
by
the
division
of
elections
that
talks
about
the
circumstances
in
which
the
secretary
would
exercise
discretion,
and
the
second
is
the
letter
that
the
secretary
sent
to
the
three
or
four
canvassing
boards
that
requested
an
extension
of
time
after
the
14th
deadline
had
passed.
she
sent
the
letter
out,
she
said,
please
indicate
to
me
whether
or
not
you
intend
to
file
returns
after
the
deadline,
and
if
you
do
what
the
reasons
are.
she
collected
a
set
of
criteria,
she
applied
the
criteria,
and
then
sent
a
letter
back,
and
what
she
did,
justice
kennedy,
in
the
case
of
the
division's
letter,
the
opinion
which,
of
course,
is
binding
under
florida
law
on
elections
officials
who
receive
them,
she...
the
division
head
said
that
there
were
certain
circumstances
such
as
acts
of
god,
hurricanes,
and
that
kind
of
thing
where
the
discretion
would
be
exercised.
when
she
came
up
with
her
additional
reasons
for
considering
whether
or
not
she
would
exercise
her
discretion,
she
indicated
a
number
of
them
which
are
also
contained
within
the
record.
it's
at
the
joint
appendix
at
21,
she
indicated
where
there
was
a
result
of
voter
fraud
with
a
substantial--
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
--i
think
she
would
have
to
exercise
her
discretion.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
in
terms
of
handing
down
its
decision?
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
i
believe
the
supreme
court
of
florida
was
looking
at
its
law
in
terms
of
articulating
the
law
that
it
wanted
to
have
then
and
on
a
going-forward
basis.
what
it
did...
and
obviously
since
it's
the
chief
court
of
the
state,
it
has
the
right
to
do
whatever
it
wishes
to
do
with
respect
to
florida
law
only
bound
by
whatever
separation
of
powers--
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
--your
honor,
i
don't
know
whether
they
thought
that
or
not,
but
that's
not
what
the
opinion
says.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
opinion
is
pretty
clear,
they
start
out
by
talking
about
statutory
construction,
and
they
hinge
everything
on
the
use
of
the
word
interpret,
and
then
they
sort
of
turn
the
word
interpret
to
a
use
that
it's
not
intended
to
be,
but
then
when
they
get
to
the
point
of
designing
the
rule
of
law
they're
going
to
go
forward
on,
they
don't
talk
about
interpreting
the
statute.
they
then
go
and
base
it
on
principles
of
equity
in
the
florida
constitution,
and
indeed
what
they
end
up
with,
your
honor,
is
this
statement
with
respect
to
the
discretion
that
the
secretary
is
left
with,
and
that
is
this...
and
it's
on
35
of
the
joint
appendix.
"we
conclude
that
consistent
with
florida's
election
scheme,
the
secretary
may
reject
a
board's.
"
that's
the
canvassing
board's,
"amended
returns
only
if
the
returns
are
submitted
so
late
that
their
inclusion
will
preclude
a
candidate
from
contesting
certification
or
preclude
florida
voters
from
participating
fully
in
the
federal
electoral
process.
"
now,
your
honor,
there's--
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
--yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
no,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
your
honor,
in
devising
the
remedy,
they
refer
to
the
florida
constitution,
but
the
issue
that
we're
here
on,
as
i
understand
it,
sir,
is
whether
or
not
the
law
changed.
there's
no
question
that
they
have
a
right
to
do
what
they
did.
the
only--
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
--i
think
they
did
rely,
in
creating
the
remedy
on
the
florida
constitution,
i
believe
they
created
a
right
that
had
not
previously
been
seen
there,
which
they
have
a
right
to
do,
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
issue
again
is
whether
or
not
the
law
that
they
articulated
on
november
21
is
different
than
the
law
that
existed
on
november
7,
and
how
the
secretary
of
state,
in
exercising
her
discretion,
was
to
divine
the
standard
that
would
be
established
on
november
21.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
well,
justice
scalia,
we
have
not
addressed
the
federal
issues
because,
i
mean,
we're
in
a
situation
where
you
have--
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
--i
understand
that,
sir.
i
apologize.
but
we
have
the
secretary
of
state
here,
we
have
the
attorney
general
here,
and
the
legislature
has
filed
by
amicus,
and
of
course
the
state
has
not
appeared,
so
it's
a
little
unusual.
we
haven't
addressed
those
issues,
but
to
answer
your
question,
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
your
honor,
it
makes
an
enormous
difference
because
the
relief
that
has
been
requested
would
be
for
the
court
to
determine
that
the
law
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
election
was
that
manual
recounting
of
ballots
would
not
be
permitted
to
address
voter
error,
which
i
think
has
been
extensively--
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
--the
only
immediate
result
would
be
that
you
would
have
a
margin
that
instead
of
being
536
votes
would
be
900-some-odd
votes,
and
it
would
only
be
added
to
as
a
result
of
whatever
was
added
by
the
overseas
ballots.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
it
will
make
a
difference
to
the
outcome
of
the
election
because
there
is
an
ongoing
contest
which
is
interrelated
and
is
involved
with
the
supreme
court's
opinion,
and
of
course
because
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
in
coming
up
with
the
remedy
that
they
came
up
with,
completely
changed
the
period
of
time
from
a
relatively
short
period
of
time,
seven
days
for
a
protest
and
much
longer
period
for
a
contest,
we
now
have
a
situation
where
there
is
19
days
for
the
protest
and
16
days
for
a
contest.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
yes,
justice
scalia,
but
the
issue
here...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
your
honor,
if
the
law
is
returned
to
the
point
it
was
on
november
7,
there
is
no
right
to
a
manual
recount
to
correct
voter
error,
and
that
will
end
the
litigation
that
currently
exists
in
the
state
of
florida,
which
were
the
opinions
of
the
secretary
of
state's
division
of
elections
that
were
issued
and
also
the
state
of
the
law
as
it
existed
at
that
point
in
time.
the
record
shows
very
clearly
that
there
was
no
dispute
that
there
were
any
problems
with
voting
machines
or
any
other
tabulation
problems
with
voting
machines.
it
was
simply
when
they
went
through
the
process
of
what
is,
justice
ginsburg,
a
discretionary
right
to
a
manual
recount,
not
a
mandatory
one,
when
they
went
into
that
and
did
the
test,
each
of
those
canvassing
boards
did
not
find
any
problem
with
a
mechanical
problem.
it
was
simply
a
problem
in
terms
of
voter
error.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
thank
you.
