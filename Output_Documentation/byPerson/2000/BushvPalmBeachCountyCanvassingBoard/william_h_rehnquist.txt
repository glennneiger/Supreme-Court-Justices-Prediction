chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
number
00-836,
george
w.
bush
vs.
the
palm
beach
county
canvassing
board.
mr.
olson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
olson,
do
you
think
that
congress
when
it
passed
3
u.s.
code,
intended
that
there
would
be
any
judicial
involvement?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
it
can
just
as
easily
be
read
as
a
direction
to
congress,
saying
what
we
are
going
to
do
when
these
electoral
votes
are
presented
to
us
for
counting.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--1877.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
olson.
mr.
klock,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
the
court,
the
florida
court
did
rely
on
the
florida
constitution.
there's
a
section
of
their
opinion
that's
devoted
to
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
perhaps
another
statement
of
the
issue
is
to
what
extent
did
the
florida
supreme
court,
in
construing
this
statute,
rely
on
more
general
provisions
of
the
florida
constitution
which
they
cited
in
their
opinion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
klock.
mr.
hancock,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
going
to
extend
your
time
two
minutes,
mr.
hancock,
because
you
haven't
had
a
chance
to
say
a
lot
yet.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
mr.
tribe,
we
will
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--can
you
tell
us
where
you're
reading
from?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
just
ask
you
a
moment,
you
say
you
don't
think
the
statute
permits
this
court
to
get
into
the
matter
at
this
time.
are
you
suggesting
there
could
be
any
judicial
review
of
a
decision
by
the
congress
to
count
one
set
of
electoral
votes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
it
certainly
was
quite
different
from--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--this
hypothetical.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
florida
law
would
that
be?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
talking
about
the
florida
constitution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
you
run
into
the
blacker
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
can
also
arise
under
the
section
of
the
constitution
that
was
construed
in
blacker.
that's
quite
independent
of
3
u.s.
5.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
one
concluded
that
the
florida
legislature
had
relied
on
the
state
constitution
in
a
way
that
the
blacker
case
says
it
may
not
in
construing
the
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
what
we
have
been
arguing--
--as
to
whether
it
does
or
whether
it
doesn't.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
i
don't
agree
with
you
on
that,
mr.
tribe.
it
seems
to
me
a
federal
question
arises
if
the
florida
supreme
court
in
its
opinion
rather
clearly
says
that
we
are
using
the
florida
constitution
to
reach
the
result
we
reach
in
construing
the
statute.
i
think
blacker
is
a
strong
argument
they
can't
do
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
it
stands
for
the
proposition
you
couldn't
do
it
then,
in
those
circumstances.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
know,
if
the
supreme
court
of
florida
simply
said
in
its
opinion,
look,
these
sections
of
the
statute
conflict,
we've
got
to
under
our
judicial
principles
resolve
it
one
way
or
the
other,
but...
but
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
goes
on
to
say,
look,
in
the
light
of
the
florida
constitution
and
the
general
rights
conferred
there,
we
are
construing
it
this
way.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tribe.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
olson,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
the
case
is
submitted.
