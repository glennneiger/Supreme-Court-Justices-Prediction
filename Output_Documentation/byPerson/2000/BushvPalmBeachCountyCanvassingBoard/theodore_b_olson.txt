mr.
theodore
b.
olson
and
may
it
please
the
court:
two
weeks
after
the
november
7
presidential
election,
the
florida
supreme
court
overturned
and
materially
rewrote
portions
of
the
carefully
formulated
set
of
laws
enacted
by
florida's
legislature
to
govern
the
conduct
of
that
election
and
the
determination
of
controversies
with
respect
to
who
prevailed
on
november
7th.
these
laws
have
been
formulated
by
the
florida
legislature
pursuant
to
an
express
delegation
of
authority,
to
wit,
by
the
united
states
constitution.
the
election
code
that
the
florida
legislature
developed
conformed
to
title
3,
section
5
of
the
united
states
code.
that
provision
invites
states
to
devise
rules
in
advance
of
an
election,
to
govern
the
counting
of
votes
and
the
settling
of
election
controversy.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
we
do,
justice
o'connor.
it
is
a
safe
harbor,
but
it's
more
than
that.
and
section
5
of
title
3
needs
to
be
construed
in
connection
with
the
history
that
brought
it
forth--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
why
i've
mentioned
the
context
in
which
that
section
was
adopted.
in
light
of
the
extreme
controversy
that
was
faced
by
this
country
as
a
result
of
the
1876
election,
and
as
this
court
knows,
that
election
was
very
close
and
led
to
controversy,
contest,
discord,
congress
was
very
much
concerned
about
the
possibility
of
that
happening
again,
and
one
of
the
reasons--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--justice
kennedy,
i
submit
that
it
is
much
like
a
compact
that
congress
is
offering
in
the
form
of
section
5,
yes.
if
you
do
these
things,
certain
things
will
happen.
but
among
these
things,
what
congress
wanted
to
accomplish
with
section
5
was
not
only
to
provide
the
benefit
to
the
states,
but
to
provide
the
benefit
to
the
united
states
of
the
states
accepting
that
implicit
proposal.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
think
the
fact
is
that
it
did
not.
what
it
did
was
it
disregarded
the
compact.
when
the
state
adopted
a
code
of
ethics,
or
a
code
of
election
procedures
to
govern
the
election
and
the
determination
of
disputes
pursuant
to
the
election,
it
brought
itself
into
that
safe
harbor
and
guaranteed
to
the
voters
and
the
candidates
in
that
state
that
the
controversy
and
turmoil
that
infected
this
country
after
the
1876--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i
certainly
agree
that
it
mentioned
those
provisions.
i'm
simply
saying
that
it
blew
past
the
important
provisions
of
section
5
and
the
benefits
that
section
5
gives
to
the
states
to
the
voters
in
that
state
and
to
the
people
running
for
office
in
that
state.
that
is
to
say
that
if
the
rules
are
complied
with,
if
disputes
are
resolved
according
to
the
rules
that
are
set
forth,
then
not
only
will
the
electors
chosen
by
the
voters
in
that
state
be
given
conclusive
effect
at
the
time
they
are
counted
by
congress
but
we
will
not
have
the
controversy,
dispute
and
chaos
that's
been
taking
place
in
florida.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
this
is
a
great
deal
different
because
this
is...
first
of
all,
article
ii
of
the
constitution
which
vests
authority
to
establish
the
rules
exclusively
in
the
legislatures
of
the
state,
tie
in
with
section
5.
secondly,
as
this
court
has
stated--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
it...
i
think
it
can't
be
divorced
from
article
ii
of
the
constitution
because
it's
a
part
of
a
plan
for
the
vesting
in
the
legislatures
of
a
state,
and
section
5
implements
article
ii
in
the
sense
that
it
provides
a
benefit
not
just
to
the
state
but
to
the
voters.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
think
that
the
state
did
not
pay,
the
state
supreme
court
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
the
federal
statute.
it
was
obviously
aware
of
it.
it
did
get
the
federal
principle--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
there
is
a
federal--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
we
believe
that
there
is,
justice
kennedy,
because
although
the
state
recognized
it,
it
blew
right
past
it.
the
state
legislature
adopted
the
code
that
the
section
5
of
article
3
of
title
3
invited
it
to
do.
the
state
supreme
court,
which
had
no
right
under
the
constitution,
but
i
can't
divorce
the
constitutional
provision
from
section
5,
then
overturned
the
plan
that
the
state
enacted
through
its
legislature
to
make
sure
that
what
happened
down
in
florida
was
not
going
to
happen.
and
so
what
the
state
supreme
court
did,
knowing
full
well
that
these
provisions
existed,
overturned
the
carefully
enacted
plan
by
florida.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
that
it
was
intend...
directed
to
congress,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
context
in
which
it
was
adopted
and
the
promise
that
it
afforded,
that
the
conclusive
effect
would
be
given
to
the
state
selection
of
electors,
that
is
a
somewhat
empty
remedy
and
it
doesn't
accomplish
congress'
objectives
if
it
cannot
be
enforced
when
an
agency
of
the
state
government
steps
in
as
the
florida
supreme
court
did
here
and
overturn
the
plan
by
which
the
florida
legislature
carefully
set
forth
a
program
so
that
disputes
could
be
resolved,
and
we
wouldn't
have
the
controversy,
conflict
and
chaos
that
we
submit
exists
today
in
florida.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
justice
stevens,
i
don't
think
that
in
this
case
that's
even
remotely
arguable.
what
the
state
supreme
court
did
is
take
a
set
of
timetables,
a
set
of
provisions
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no.
not
necessarily.
but
the
102...
there
is
the
two
provisions,
section
102.111
and
102.112.
111
contains
the
shall
date,
102
contains
the
may
date.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
both
of
those
statutes,
both
of
those
provisions
say
that
the
returns
must
be,
or
shall
be
filed
by
a
certain
deadline.
the
shall
and
the
may
provisions
simply
relate
to
the
possible
remedy.
we
submit
that
under
either
interpretation
the
secretary
of
state
of
florida
either
must
or
shall
ignore
those
returns,
or
may
set
those
aside
in
her
discretion.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
i
believe--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
don't
think
so.
she
took
the
position--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
don't
know
of
any.
i
haven't
thought
of
any,
justice
stevens.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the
problem
is
that
it's...
what
we
are
saying
is
that
either
it's
mandatory,
in
which
case
she
could
not
accept
them.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the
florida
supreme
court
and
what
the
circuit
court
did
in
that
case,
it
said
that
it
wasn't...
and
we'll
accept
this
for
purposes
of
this
argument
that
it
wasn't--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
that
we
can
answer
that
this
way,
is
that
whether
it
was
shall
ignore
or
may
ignore.
it
was
not
must
accept.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
under
no
circumstances
was
it
must
accept.
now--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
don't
believe
so,
justice
stevens.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
what
the
court
did
was
so
constrain
those
circumstances,
virtually
to
make
them
nonexistent.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
that...
yes,
but
i
think
that
it
has
to
be
looked
at
in
the
context
in
which
that
was
done
when
the
state
supreme
court
so
constrained
and
says
in
its
opinion
shall
accept
these
late
returns
until
5
p.m.
on
november
26th,
and
in
the
context
there
was
no
discretion
left
for
the
secretary
of
state
at
all.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
up
to.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
first
part
of
the
recount
provision
to
which
you're
referring,
justice
ginsburg,
says
may
conduct
a
recount.
under
certain
circumstances
after
the
sampling
part
of
that
process
is
taken,
if
it's
taken
in
the
county
canvassing
board's
discretion,
then
under
certain
circumstances
it's
supposed
to
go
forward
with
a
more
fulsome
process,
but
the
legislature
being
fully
aware
of
the
recount
provisions
and
the
importance
of...
this
ties
in
with
the
protest
period
for
the
election,
which
overlaps
the
recount
provisions,
and
the
contest
provision
for
the
election,
and
the
fact
that
all
of
this
has
to
be
done
in
the
context
of
a
presidential
election.
under
any
other
kind
of
election,
these
things
wouldn't
be
nearly
as
important,
but
we
have
very
important
timetables,
and
as
this
court
has
said
a
presidential
election
is
so
important
to
the
rest
of
the
nation,
and
there
is
such
high
federal
interest
in
accomplishing
these
things
in
the
right
way,
what
the
florida
legislature
did
is
balance
the
protest
period,
the
recount
period
with
the
contest
period,
and
state
that
there
shall
be
certain
deadlines
before
which
certain
things
need
to
be
done
and
after
which,
so
what
those
two
statutes
say
is
that
there
may
be
a
recount,
but
that
there
shall
be
compliance
with
the
time
deadline.
it
also
says
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--this
is
a
very
unusual
situation,
justice
ginsburg,
because
it
is
in
the
context
of
a
presidential
election,
and
it
is
in
the
context
of
federal
rights.
this
court
has,
in
the
areas
in
which
we've
described
in
our
brief,
undertaken
to
review
the
meaning
and
the
effect
that
the
state
supreme
court
or
state
court
decision
under
certain
circumstances.
we
submit
this
is
one.
what
the
florida
supreme--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
but
then
the
court
has
also
said,
then
we
go
on
to
see
the
extent
to
which
what
the
state
court
did,
as
we
cited
in
the
lindsey
case,
for
example,
in
the
ex
post
facto
context,
we
go
on
to
see
what
the
import
of
that
is
in
connection
with
the
federal
right.
i
would
emphasize
that
what
the
florida
supreme
court
did
is
basically
essentially
say,
we're
rewriting
the
statute,
we're
changing
it.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
secretary
of
state
did.
it
doesn't...
she
doesn't
much
anymore
because
what
has
happened...
and
i
would
like
to
finish
that
one
point,
that
the
florida
supreme
court
said
we
are
not
going
to
be
bound
by
technical
statutory
requirements
or
what
the
supreme
court
called
hyper-technical
statutory
requirements.
instead,
we
are
going
to
resort
to
the
will
of
the
people,
the
will
of
the
electorate,
the
will
of
the
voters,
so
to
speak,
and
we
are
going
to...
because
we
can't
rewrite
the
statute,
but
we
are
going
to
partially
rewrite
the
statute,
we
are
going
to
resort
to
our
equitable
powers.
so
what...
and
among
the
things
that
the
court
did,
and
there
are
a
range
of
them,
as
i
have
indicated,
they
took
away
the
discretion
of
the
secretary
and
instructed
her
to
accept
these
manual
recount
returns.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
it
wouldn't
have
been,
but--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--they
recited
four
canons
of
statutory
construction,
justice
stevens,
but
when
they
said
they
use
those
construction...
canons
of
statutory
construction
to
say
that
the
words
may
and
shall
mean
shall
not,
that
is
not
a
reasonable
exercise
of
statutory
construction.
i
think
what
the...
it's
relatively
obvious
that
what
the
supreme
court
did
is
exactly
what
article...
section
5
of
article
iii
intends
not
to
happen.
change
the
rules.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
yes,
i
agree
with
that
up
to
a
point,
but
then
it
says
that
she
must
accept
these
returns
that
are
after
the
deadline.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
right,
but...
so
there
was
both
going
on,
and
what
the
court
was
bound
and
determined
to
do
was
to
get
to
a
consequence
that
the
court
determined
was
consistent
with
the
will
of
the
people,
irrespective
of
what
the
statute--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
would
like
to
answer
that
in
two
ways.
in
the
first
place,
i
don't
mean
to
suggest,
and
i
hope
my
words
didn't,
that
there
was
a
lack
of
integrity
or
any
dishonesty
by
the
florida
supreme
court.
what
we're
saying,
that
it
was
acting
far
outside
the
scope
of
its
authority
in
connection
with
an
exercise
of
power
that
is
vested
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--but...
under
almost
any
other
circumstances,
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
but
in
this
context,
in
this
context,
we
are
talking
about
a
federal
right,
a
federal
constitutional
right,
and
the
rights
of
individual
citizens
under
the
constitution
and
so
therefore,
this
court
has
a
grave
responsibility
to
look--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
we
are
very
definitely
relying
on
article
ii
of
the
constitution.
the
framers
of
the
constitution
debated
long
and
hard.
it
was
one
of
the
longest
debates
that
took
place
during
the
formation
of
the
constitution.
where
should
this
power
be
lodged,
in
the
federal
legislature,
in
the
state
legislature,
at
the
ballot
booth
or
what.
the
one
thing
that
was
discussed
and
rejected
by
virtually
everyone
is
that
the
power
to
select
the
manner
in
which
electors
would
be
appointed
would
be
in
the
state
judiciary,
and
we
quote...
in
the
state
judiciary.
that
was
rejected.
the
notion
that
it
would
be
vested
in
the
state
judiciary
was
something
that
was
rejected,
and
what
the
framers
decided
to
do
is
to
vest
it
in
the
state
legislature
and
vested
that
authority
under
article
ii,
not
just
in
the
state,
but
the
legislature.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
it
is...
yes,
it
said
that,
justice
kennedy.
but
what
it
did
was
supplant
a
set
of
rules
elect...
enacted
before
the
election
to
govern
the
election,
for
a
set
of
rules
made
up
after
the
election.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
because
i
submit
that
that
writes
section
5
essentially
out
of
existence
if
an
agency
of
state
government,
if
a
state
legislature--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--if
the
state
agency,
if
the
state
legislature
empowered
by
article
ii
of
the
constitution,
does
what
it
is
invited
to
do
by
section
5,
and
then
another
agency
of
state
government,
in
this
case
the
state
supreme
court,
comes
along
and
upsets
that
scheme,
yes,
you
have
ultimate
resort
to
the
resolution
of
the
dispute
under
sections
15
of
title
3,
but
that's
precisely--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i'm
not
making
myself
clear,
i
think,
is
that
the
importance
of
section
5
was
to
invite
the
state
to
do
things
that
would
avoid
the
chaos
and
the
conflict
and
the
controversy
and
the
unsettled
situation
that
this
country
faced
in
1876,
and--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
don't
know,
justice
scalia.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
when
it
was
adopted.
i
can't
recall
whether
it
was
a
part
of
the
1887
electoral
count
statute
or
not.
i
can
probably
answer
that
in
regard--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
it
seems
to
me
it
wouldn't
make
a
difference,
because
of
this.
it
might...
yes,
it
certainly
might
make
a
difference
one
way,
but
it
still
wouldn't
make
a
difference
because
our
concept
here,
and
i
think
it's
quite
a
rational
and
actually
the
only
explanation
for
how
you
can
put
these
provisions
together,
article
ii
and
section
5,
and
congress'
desire
to
avoid
the
very
controversy,
chaos,
conflict,
which
even--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
but
that's
what
the
country...
what
essentially
section
15,
although
it
modifies
it
and
structures
it
somewhat,
it
was
still
a
situation
that
congress
was
facing
in
1876
when
it
was
dealing
with
the
hayes-tilden
election.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
and
by
the
time
it
got
there,
there
were
dueling
slates
of
electors
that
were
buying...
there
were
exchanges
and
a
lot
of
things
that
everyone
felt
was
very
destructive
to
the
country.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
that's
a
very
important
point,
and
let
me
make
it:
that
congress
did
say
if
you
do
these
things,
certain
consequences
will
flow
from
it.
florida
did
these
things,
and
we
submit
that
there
is,
that
the
courts
are
here
to
protect
the
benefit
of
the
bargain
that
florida
made
when
it
responded
to
that
invitation,
because--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
not
a
fair
reading
of
section
5,
and
let
me
answer
this
question,
and
i
would
like
with
the
court's
permission
to
reserve
the
time--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
don't
think
that
they
can
be
read
in
isolation.
i
think
that
section
5
was
designed
to
avoid
the
problem
created
by
the
controversy
and
the
having
to
resolve
this
in
congress,
which
is
exactly
what
did
happen
in
1876,
and
was
a
very
unsatisfactory
situation.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--1877.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
right.
and
it
put
those
rules
with
respect
to
conclusiveness
into
section
5.
the
florida
legislature
bought
into
that
scheme
and
now
the
florida
supreme
court,
which
doesn't
have
any
constitutional
authority
pursuant
to
section
2
to
do
so,
upset
that
scheme,
deprived
florida
of
the
benefit
of
doing
exactly
what
congress
wanted
to
have
happen
under
section
5.
i
would,
with
the
court's
permission,
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
very
difficult
to
read
the
florida
supreme
court
decision
as
saying
anything
else
other
than
the
florida
constitution
in
their
view,
in
that
court's
view,
is
trumping
everything
else.
the
second
paragraph
of
the
conclusion
says
because
the
right
to
vote
is
the
preeminent
right
in
the
declaration
of
rights
of
the
florida
constitution
and
so
forth,
this
opinion
is
full
of
language--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--they
are
saying--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
that
the
only
reasonable
fair
reading
of
the
decision
is
that
the
florida
supreme
court
felt
that,
and
it
says
it
over
and
over
again,
that
we
are
going
to
be...
attempt
to
discern
the
will
of
the
people,
the
will
of
the
electorate
and
discern,
and
enhance
in
whatever
way
we
possibly
can
the
right
to
vote.
and
because
of
that,
these
provisions
of
the
statute
which
are
very
much
quintessentially
legislative,
the
timetables
that
are
involved
in
this
statute,
particularly
the
november
14th
deadline,
is
a
part
of
a
composite
package.
there
is
one
week
for
a
protest
and
certain
recounts
to
the
extent
that
they
can
be
done
and
there
are
four
weeks
for
contests.
when
the
florida
supreme
court
truncated,
when
the
florida
supreme
court
expanded
the
protest
period
from
7
days
to
19
days,
it
necessarily
limited
the
contest
period
to
a
shorter
period
of
time.
it
changed
the
discretion.
it
allowed
certain
things
to
occur
that
couldn't
have
occurred
and
it
justifies
all
of
those
things
on
the
grounds
that
the
florida
supreme
court,
the
florida
constitution
trumps
those
legislative
concerns,
and
that's
why
it
said
we
are
not
going
to
be
dissuaded
by
hypertechnical
statutory
considerations.
so
the
court
was
doing
what
this
court
said
in
the
mcpherson
vs.
blacker
case
that
it
cannot
do,
allow
itself
to
insert
itself
or
the
florida
constitution
over
what
is
required
by
article
ii,
section
1
of
the
constitution.
it
also
seems
to
me
quite
evident
in
response
to
what
justice
kennedy
was
asking
earlier,
that
there
was
concern
about
the
federal
statutory
provision,
the
language
to
which
i
think
justice
kennedy
was
referring
is
on
page
32-a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
from
the
court's
decision,
and
there
is
a
footnote
there
that
does
refer
to
reference
to
3
u.s.c.
1
through
10,
which
of
course
includes
section
5,
and
it
says
so
in
conjunction
with
the
statement
that
the
exercise
of
the
discretion
by
the
secretary
of
state
could
not
be
done
in
such
a
way
that
would
preclude
florida
voters
from
participating
fully
in
the
federal
electoral
process.
the
court
was
assuming,
it
seems
to
me,
that
it
did
not,
was
not
conflict...
the
decision
that
it
was
rendering
was
not
going
to
cause
a
conflict
with
the
federal
statutory
scheme,
and
it
was,
we
submit,
in
error
in
that
regard.
so
the...
the...
to
sum
up
with
respect
to
this,
the
florida
supreme
court
radically
changed
the
legislative
scheme
because
it
thought
it
could
do
so
under
the
florida
constitution.
by
doing
so,
it
acted
inconsistently
with
article
ii
of
the
constitution,
and
inconsistently
with
section
5
of
title
iii,
and
it
has
brought
about
precisely
the
circumstances
that
section
5
of
section
3,
title
iii,
was
designed
to
avoid.
