mr.--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olson,
may
i
ask
you,
because
you've
been
skipping
over
what
i
thought
was
a
key
piece
of
the
florida
legislation.
the
florida
supreme
court
said,
there's
the
deadline,
and
that
conflicts
with
another
provision
of
this
law,
the
provision
that
says
there
shall
be
under
certain
circumstances
recounts,
and
then
there's
a
rather
detailed
description
of
the
process
that's
necessary,
the
time
line
for
when
you
can
ask
the
recount
is
on
the
6th
day.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yeah,
up
to.
and
it
would
be
impossible
in
a
populous
county
to
in
one
day
do
what
the
statute
instructs
must
be
done
when
there's
a
recount.
the
florida
supreme
court
said,
it's
right
in
its
opinion,
there's
two
conflicts,
and
the
first
one
they
mention
straight
out
on
page
21a
of
your
appendix,
is
that
there
has
to
be
a
reconciliation
between
this,
yes,
there
can
be
recounts
and,
yes,
there's
a
deadline.
so
they
are
trying
to
reconcile
two
provisions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
something
that
one
can
certainly
argue.
my
problem
is,
one
could
also
argue
what
the
florida
supreme
court
said,
and
i
do
not
know
of
any
case
where
we
have
impugned
a
state
supreme
court
the
way
you
are
doing
in
this
case.
i
mean,
in
case
after
case
we
have
said
we
owe
the
highest
respect
to
what
the
state
says,
state
supreme
court
says,
is
the
state's
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
said,
and
even
in
the
very
cases
that
you
cite,
because
i
checked
them,
that
we
owe
the
highest
respect
to
the
state
court
when
it
says
what
the
state
law
is.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olson,
would
you
agree
that
when
we
read
a
state
court
decision,
we
should
read
it
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
integrity
of
the
state
supreme
court,
that
if
there
are
two
possible
readings,
one
that
would
impute
to
that
court
in
judicial
behavior,
lack
of
integrity,
indeed
dishonesty,
and
the
other
one
that
would
read
the
opinion
to
say
we
think
this
court
is
attempting
to
construe
the
state
law...
it
may
have
been
wrong,
we
might
have
interpreted
it
differently,
but
we
are
not
the
arbiters,
they
are.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
it
tells
us...
if
it
tells
us,
we
see
these
two
provisions
in
conflict,
they
need
to
be
reconciled.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hancock,
are
you
relying
on
the
florida
supreme
court
statement
at
least
twice
in
its
opinion...
now
i
looked
at
the
page
to
which
mr.
klock
referred,
page
37-a,
it
says
for
the
second
time
that
section,
the
section
governing
manual
recounts
appears
to
conflict
with
the
sections
that
set
a
deadline,
and
it's
reconciling
that
conflict.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
whether
it
was
wrong
or
right,
that's
what
it
said
its
mission
was
and
that's
what
it
did.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
said
that
twice,
and
i
think
that's
critical
if
you
add
to
that
that
we
read
a
decision
of
a
state
court
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
that
court
and
not
in
the
light
least
favorable.
i
suppose
there
would
be
a
possibility
for
this
court
to
remand
for
clarification,
but
if
there's
two
readings,
one
that's
questionable,
one
that
isn't,
all
of
our
decisions
suggest
that
we
read
the
one--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
tribe,
before
you
finish,
i
would
like
to
know
whether
you
are
conceding
some
of
the
things
you
said.
sounds
like
maybe
you
are.
but
the
florida
legislature
under
article
ii,
section
1,
could
say
we
don't
want
any
judicial
review
of
anything
about
the
manner
in
which
we
say
electors
should
be
appointed.
does
the
florida
legislature
have
the
authority
to
cut
out
judicial
review?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
i
mean
the
state
judiciary.
the
state
judiciary.
when
it
says
each
state
shall
appoint
electors
in
such
manner
as
the
legislature
thereof
may
direct.
may
the
legislature
direct
as
to
the
florida
supreme
court,
and
florida
supreme
court
we
don't
want
you
to
review
whatever
we
do?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
could
the
state
legislature
at
least
now
say
in
light
of
all
this
confusion,
we
enact
a
law
today
saying
this
is
the
way
electors
will
be
selected?
is
that
open
to
the
legislature
now?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
i
look
in
the
conclusion,
the
paragraph
on
page
37-a,
where
they
summarize
what
they
said,
there
is
nothing
there
about
the
florida
constitution.
it's
only
about
the
florida
election
code.
they
say
they
must
construe
the
florida
election
code
as
a
whole,
and
they
point
out
the
provisions
in
conflict.
there
is
not
one
word
in
that
paragraph
that
says
anything
about
the
florida
constitution.
