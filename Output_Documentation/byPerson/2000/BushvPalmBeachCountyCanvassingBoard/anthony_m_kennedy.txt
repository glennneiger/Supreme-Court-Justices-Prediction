anthony
m.

yeah,
but
what
they
did
was,
and
it's
typical
of
grant-in-aid
programs,
they
said
if
you
run
a
clean
shop
down
there,
we'll
give
you
a
bonus,
and
if
you
don't,
well,
you
take
your
chances
with
everybody
else.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
is
there
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
that
indicates
that
it
relied
on
this
federal
statute
in
the
reasoning
for
its
decision
and
in
its
judgment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
are
looking
for
a
federal
issue,
and
i
thought
that
you
might
have
argued
that
the
secretary
of
state
was
instructed
by
the
supreme
court
not
to
jeopardize
the
state's
chances
and
then
cited
3
u.s.c.
sections
1
through
10.
and
so
if
the,
if
the
state
supreme
court
relied
on
a
federal
issue
or
a
federal
background
principle
and
got
it
wrong,
then
you
can
be
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
just
talk
about
the
statutory
issue.
i
assume
that
if
we
worked
long
enough
with
justice
scalia's
hypothetical,
we
could
find
a
case
where
a
court
adjudicated
with
reference
to
the
federal
principle
and
got
the
federal
principle
wrong.
did...
indiana
vs.
brand
and
that
kind
of
thing.
did
that
happen
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
there
is
no
federal
constitutional
issue
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
pardon
me,
statutory
issue.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
secretary
have
any
flexibility
to
accommodate
the
statute
to
the
exigencies
of
the
presidential
election?
the
secretary
of
state.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
state
legislature
could
vest
it
in
the
judiciary
if
it
wanted,
as
i
read
the
mcpherson
case,
and
here
they
have
done
something
less.
the
state
judiciary
said,
we
are
going
to
invoke
the
ordinary
election
procedures,
which
you
know,
warts
and
all,
it
involves
some
interpretation
by
the
courts
and
contest
proceedings,
et
cetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
secretary
maintain
that
in
some
instances
she
has
a
discretion
that
a
court
does
not
or
can
a
court
do
whatever
she
might
do,
under
florida
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your
brief
you
say,
you
conclude
that
the
florida
supreme
court
like,
i
think
it's
page
12,
like
any
state
court,
exercised
its
inherent
equitable
powers
to
remedy
a
threat
to
fundamental
constitutional
rights,
and
it
rewrote
the
certification
deadlines
according
to
that
power,
did
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
that
such
an
amorphous
general
abstract
standing
that
it
can't
possibly
be
said
to
be
a
law
that
was
enacted
and
in
place
at
the
time
of
the
election?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
the
constitution
was
there
before
the
election,
the
due
process
clause
is
before
the
election,
but
what
we
are
talking
about
is
having
laws
of
sufficient
specificity
and
stability
that
people
can
rely
on
them
in
advance
and
not
have
them
changed
after
the
fact.
and
your
brief
makes
it
very
clear
that
they
exercised
their
inequitable
powers
to
remedy
a
threat
to
fundamental
constitutional
rights
and
changed
the
deadline
accordingly.
it
seems
to
me
that's
no
standard...
it's
an
enviable
standard,
something
we
might
all
agree
with
in
the
end,
but
as
far
as
the
requisite
specificity
to
satisfy
3
u.s.c.
section
5,
i
just
don't
see
it
as
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
maybe
it
had
to
do
something,
but
did
it
comply
with
3
u.s.c.
section
5?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
did
it
comply
with
that
part
of
3
u.s.c.
section
5
that
requires
that
laws
be
enacted
and
in
place
prior
to
the
election
in
order
to
get
the
safe
harbor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
it
your
position
that
any
interpretation
the
supreme
court
of
florida
makes
to
implement
the
will
of
the
people
is
never
a
new
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
seeing
no
important
policy
in
3
u.s.c.
section
5.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
fact,
we
can
change
the
rules
after...
not
important...
the
popular
culture--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
won't
get
you
an
extra
two
minutes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
suggest
in
your
reply
brief
that
it
is
not...
i
think
you
said
it's
not
self-evident
that
the
florida
legislature
at
this
time
has
the
right
to
appoint
any
slate
of
delegates
because
the
congress
has
set
the
date,
and
the
date
is
the
general
election
day.
if
that
is
so,
doesn't
this
mean
that
when
we
talk...
think
about
justiciability,
we
must
be
very
careful
to
preserve
the
role
of
the
court.
you
have
said
or
suggested
here
in
your
reply
brief
that
the
florida
legislature
now
has
no
role.
you
are
now
suggesting
that
this
court
has
no
role.
that
means
the
supreme
court
of
florida
is
it,
so
far
as
a
judicial
interpretation
of
the
consequences
of
3
u.s.c.
section
5.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
my
point
is
that
puts
hydraulic
pressure
on
your
nonjusticiability
argument
and
makes
it
a
very,
very
important
argument
and
a
critical
argument
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
legislature--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
if
the
legislature
had
jumped
into
the
breach
and
said
this
same
thing,
would
that
be
a
new
statute
or
new
enactment
under
5
u.s.c.?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
are
you
saying
you
can't
tell
us
whether
they,
in
the
hypothetical,
supposed
that
it
would
be
a
new
enactment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
don't
think
you
could
tell
us
what
you
might
advise
the
congress
if
you
were
the
counsel
for
the
judiciary
committee.
