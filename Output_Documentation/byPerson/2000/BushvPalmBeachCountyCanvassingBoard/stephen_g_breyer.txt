justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--isn't
the
law
in
florida
like
as
in
most
states,
and
in
the
federal
government,
that
when
an
official
has
discretion,
may
accept
or
may
not
accept,
that
has
to
be
exercised
within
the
limits
of
reason?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then,
isn't
it
possible
that
when
the
court
says
she
must
accept
under
certain
circumstances,
what
they
mean
is
outside
those
circumstances,
given
the
circumstances
here
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
refuse?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
then
what
you're
arguing
about
is
a
determination
by
the
state
court
of
florida
as
to
what
the
circumstances
are
under
state
law
where
the
action
of
a
state
official
would
or
would
not
be
reasonable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--can
you
tell
me
when
this
petition
was
filed
here,
the
secretary
had
not
certified
anybody
the
winner,
and
now
the
secretary
has
certified
a
winner,
and
therefore,
i
guess,
whether
we
win,
whether
your
side,
the
side
you're
supporting
wins
or
loses,
it
doesn't
change
that,
and
i
guess
that's
moot,
but
my
question
is,
is
there
any
respect
in
which
this
really
makes
a
difference,
this
case?
how?
i'm
thinking,
if
it
does
make
a
difference,
numbers
of
vote,
is
that
kind
of
thing
right
for
us
to
decide
now?
how
could
it
make
a
difference?
what's
the
consequence
of
our
going
one
way
or
the
other
now
in
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
don't
have...
all...
suppose
they
won
and
the
relief
was,
suppose
your
side
won,
and
the
relief
was,
fine,
it
should
have
been
certified
on
november
14th
or
18th
instead
of
november
26th.
now,
what's
the
consequence
of
that?
just
that?
forgetting
what
the
reasoning
is.
is
there
a
consequence
that
flows
from
that,
that
is
real,
adverse,
you
know,
significant,
concrete
that
we
can
predict
now
as
opposed
to
speculate?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
then
this
case
has
said,
we've
said
a
claim
is
not
ripe
if
it
rests
upon
contingent
future
events
that
may
not
occur
as
anticipated
or
indeed
may
not
occur
at
all.
and
so
what
i
wonder,
is
this
in
this
realm
of
speculation
as
to
whether
or
not
it
will
or
will
not
make
a
difference,
a
difference
to
the
outcome
of
the
election.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you...
can
you
just
go
back
to
your
characterization
of
the
opinion.
i
think
we
would
all
agree
that
given
that
the
legislature
has
to
select
the
manner,
a
state
can't
say,
our
constitution
selects
the
electors.
i
suppose
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right,
but
thinking
of
this
opinion,
suppose
the
court
had
said,
look,
we
reach
our
result
based
on
the
canons
we
found
in
blackstone.
now,
nobody
is
going
to
say
they
said
blackstone
is
selecting
the
electors,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
i
suppose
they
said,
we
reached
this
decision
based
on
the
values
found
in
the
constitution.
that
would
be
like
blackstone.
but
suppose
they
say,
well,
the
legislature
wants
us
to
do
x,
but
our
constitution
requires
us
to
do
not
x.
that
might
be
different.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what
is
it
that
they
have
done
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
is
the
november
26th
date?
is
that
the
seven
day
date
moved
or
is
that
some
kind
of
a
date
that
tries
to
reconcile
the
ultimate
point
after
which
the
secretary
in
exercising
her
discretion
no
longer
has
to
accept
the
late
returns?
did
it
move
the
date
from
the
statute?
has
it
created
a
new
date
about
this
discretion?
what
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
doesn't
change...
that's
not
the
date.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
suppose
they
refer
to
the
declaration
of
the
rights
of
man,
to
1789,
the
french
revolution,
i
mean,
the
right
to
vote
is
a
value
in
the
constitution.
are
they
actually
saying...
i
didn't
see
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
are
they
are
saying
the
statute
means
one
thing,
but
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
the
constitution
of
florida
says
the
opposite.
i
didn't
see
that.
