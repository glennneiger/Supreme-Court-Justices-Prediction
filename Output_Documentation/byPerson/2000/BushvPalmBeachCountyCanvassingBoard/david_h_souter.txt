justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
mr.
olson,
let's
assume
that
it
did
that,
for
the
sake
of
argument.
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
issue
that
the
chief
justice
raised
a
little
while
ago,
and
i'd
like
you
to
comment
on
this
line
of
reasoning.
you've
got
section
5.
congress
in
the
statute
seems
to
have
gone
to
great
lengths
to
provide
what
to
do
in
the
situation
that
you
are
describing,
accepting
your
view
of
the
case.
section
5,
it
says
if
you
do
certain
things
within
certain
times,
the
conclusion
that
you
draw
is
going
to
be
conclusive
upon
the
congress.
in
section
15,
it
sets
out
in
fact
an
elaborate
set
of
contingencies
about
what
the
congress
is
supposed
to
do
and
can
do
if
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
whether
a
given
set
of
procedures
in
the
state
have
conformed
to
section
5.
section
15
refers
to
regularity.
it
refers
to
legality
and
illegality.
it
looks
to
me
as
though
at
least
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings,
congress
has
said
if
there
is
a
question
about
whether
this
if-then
provision
in
section
5,
construing
article
ii,
has
been
satisfied,
then
this
is
the
decisional
tree
for
the
congress
to
follow
in
deciding
what
to
do
about
it
and
in
resolving
challenges.
it
looks
to
me
as
though
at
this
stage
of
the
game,
the
statute
has
committed
the
determination
of
the
issues
that
you
raise
and
the
consequences
to
follow
from
them
to
the
congress.
why
should
the
court,
why
should
the
federal
judiciary
be
interfering
in
what
seems
to
be
a
very
carefully
thought
out
scheme
for
determining
what
happens
if
you
are
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
it
doesn't
write
it
out
of
existence.
it
provides
in
section
15
what
happens
if
the
state
agency
does
what
you
say
it
did.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
say
you
have
ultimate
resort.
but
that
begs
the
question,
that
seems
to
be
precisely
the
resort
that
congress
has
provided.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
section
15
assumes
that
there
is
controversy
and
chaos.
justice
david
h.
souter
section
15
isn't
providing
for
challenges
except
in
situations
perhaps
exactly
like
this
one.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
congress
had
to
face
the
constitutional
fact
that
under
article
ii,
it
could
not,
or
its
understanding
was
certainly,
that
it
could
not
mandate
certain
state
procedures.
article
ii
did
say
the
legislature
shall
decide
what
they
are.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
most
that
congress
could
do
in
providing
for
a
more
orderly
resolution
of
what
happened
in
hayes-tilden
was
to
do
what
it
did
in
section
5,
and
that
is
to
say
if
you
do
certain
things,
you
can
depend
upon
the
results,
recognizing
that
the
state
might
not
do
those
things.
and
it
then
provided,
or
at
least
at
the
present
time
it
is
provided
in
article,
in
section
15,
that
if
you
don't
do
those
things,
there
is
a
sequence
of
issues
that
can
be
raised
to
be
decided
by
the
congress.
if
congress
wanted
this
court
to
get
into
the
issue
at
this
stage,
it
seems
passing
strange
to
me
that
despite
all
the
elaborateness
of
section
15
there
wouldn't
have
been
some
mention
of
federal
litigation
proceeding
in
the
section
15
proceeding.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
certainly
could
express
its
preference
for
a
scheme
whereby
the
initial
litigation,
if
you
will,
at
this
level,
would
take
place
in
the
congress.
to
acknowledge
that
is
not
to
say
that
the
issue
is
justiciable
or
that
this
court
has
somehow
been
necessarily
excluded
from
the
process
for
all
time.
it
is
simply
to
say
that
the
first
line
of
litigation
at
the
federal
level
seems
under
the
statute
to
be
congress,
and
not
the
court.
isn't
that
a
fair
reading
of
15?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
don't
think
section
5
goes
to
the
issue.
the
question
is
whether
it's
a
fair
reading
of
section
15.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
in
1876,
congress
did
not
have--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
rules
with--
justice
david
h.
souter
congress
did
not
have
the
rules
with
respect
to
conclusiveness
that
it
now
has
under
section
5.
justice
david
h.
souter
page
3a
of
the
blue
brief.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
there
another...
go
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
there
another
way
of
looking
at
what
the
florida
court
did,
and
that
was
in
effect
to
apply
the
statute,
the
interpretative
criterion,
that
where
there
is
any
discretion
for
interpretation,
an
unconstitutional
result
should
be
avoided,
and
because
you
have
here
a
statute
as
i
understand
it
that
regulates
both
federal
and
state
recounts,
that
much
is,
i
think
is
clear.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
only
way
to
avoid
an
unconstitutional
meaning
of
the
statute
so
far
as
florida
law
was
concerned
was
to
get
into
this
constitutional
concern
about
preserving
the
franchise,
and
that
because
the
legislature
intended
one
standard
to
cover
both
federal
and
state
recounts,
it
therefore
is
valid
to
consider
the
state
constitution
in
order
to
derive
a
general
meaning
that
will
apply
to
a
federal,
as
well
as
a
state
election.
can
you
look
at
it
that
way?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
also
true
that
the
inability
to
use
section
7
depended
in
the
florida
supreme
court's
reasoning
not
on
the
existence
of
the
constitution
as
the
sole
reason,
but
on
the
inability
to
make
the
december
7
date
final
and
provide
for
the
recounts
within
the
times
in
which
recounts
can
be
called
for.
what
i'm
saying
is,
didn't
they
say
that
the
date
of
the
7th
cannot
stand,
not
because
of
the
constitution
alone
but
because
there
are
other
provisions
in
the
statute
that
cannot
be
accommodated
with
sections...
with
the
7
date?
justice
david
h.
souter
wouldn't
justice--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
wouldn't
justice
scalia's
suggestion
be
a
stronger
suggestion
if
they
had
dealt
by
the
statute
only
with
federal
elections
or
only
with
a
presidential
election
as
opposed
to
dealing
with
both
state
and
federal
in
the
same
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
but
when
they...
when
they
don't
bifurcate,
it's
reasonable
to
suppose
that
they
expect
their
statute
to
be
construed,
number
one,
as
one
statute,
not
as
having
different
dates
for
different,
for
state
and
federal;
and,
number
two,
to
be
construed
so
far
as
the
state
concern
arises
in
accordance
with
the
state
constitution,
and
if
that
is
so,
then
the
result
is
they
would
expect
a
state
constitutional
concern
to
inform
their
interpretation
of
a
statute
which
ultimately
governs
federal
as
well
as
state.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
as
a
result
of
federal
law,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
wasn't
the
legislature's
choice,
it
was
congress'
choice
that
required
that.
