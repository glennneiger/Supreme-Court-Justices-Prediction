mr.
paul
hancock
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
accordance
with
article
ii
of
the
united
states
constitution,
the
florida
legislature
has
directed
the
manner
of
selecting
presidential
electors
in
florida.
that
manner
is
pursuant
to
a
popular
vote
that's
implemented
pursuant
to
the
general
election
laws
of
the
state
of
florida.
mr.
paul
hancock
yes,
justice
o'connor.
we
agree
with
that.
in
implementing
the
election
law,
each
branch
of
the
florida
government
plays
a
role.
for
example,
the
judiciary,
or
the
executive
branch
of
our
government
has
not
found
itself
bound
by
the
technical,
hypertechnical
requirements
of
the
election
law.
an
example
of
that
is
that
the,
the
executive
branch
has
implemented
a
rule,
not
a
law,
but
a
rule
that
allows
absentee
ballots
from
overseas
military
voters
to
be
received
after
the
10
days
after
the
close
of
the
polls.
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
florida,
all
absentee
ballots
have
to
be
received
by
the
time
the
polls
close
on
election
day.
mr.
paul
hancock
the
only...
yes,
justice
kennedy.
the
only
equitable
power
exercised
by
the
court
was
setting
the
deadline.
mr.
paul
hancock
no.
the
laws
were
enacted
well
before
the
election.
what
happened
was
that
in
the
court--
mr.
paul
hancock
--the
court
had
to
do
something,
justice
kennedy.
it
was
faced
with
conflicts
in
florida
law.
they
had
conflicting
opinions
from
the
florida
attorney
general
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
law
and
the
secretary
of
state
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
law.
as
a
result
of--
mr.
paul
hancock
--i
submit,
justice
kennedy,
that
3
u.s.c.
section
5
doesn't
require
the
state
to
do
anything,
it
merely
says--
mr.
paul
hancock
--yes,
it
did.
the
laws
were
in
place
before
the
election.
and
those
laws
granted
to
the
judiciary--
mr.
paul
hancock
--yes.
mr.
paul
hancock
yes,
it
was
done
pursuant--
mr.
paul
hancock
--the...
i
agree
that
the
date
was
implemented
pursuant
to
the
court's
equitable
powers.
other
than
that,
it
was
a
routine
exercise
in
statutory
construction.
the
court
was
faced
with
a
situation
first
of
all
where
because
of
conflicting
advice
the
counties
had
started
and
then
stopped
conducting
manual
recounts
because
of
advice
from
the
secretary
of
the
state
which
the
supreme
court
ultimately
concluded
to
be
erroneous.
mr.
paul
hancock
no,
justice--
mr.
paul
hancock
--no,
i'm
not
aware
of
it
ever
happening
before.
but,
i
can
say
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
for
100
years
has
put
a
duty
on
election
officials
to
discern
the
intent
of
the
voter,
and
while
the
secretary
of
the
state
refers
to
it
as
voter
error,
when
the
ballot
is
punched,
that's,
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
florida
as
interpreted
by
the
supreme
court,
that
voter
has
cast
the
ballot,
even
if
the
chad
did
not--
mr.
paul
hancock
--the
supreme...
yes.
i
can't
say
ever,
but
i'd
say
that
on
the
case
before
the
court,
all
that
was
before
the
court
was
ordinary
statutory
construction,
which
must
be,
the
result
of
it
whether
this
court
would
agree
with
it
or
disagree
with
it,
must
be
respected
by
this
court.
that's
the
very
foundation
of
federalism.
mr.
paul
hancock
yes.
mr.
paul
hancock
yes.
both
in
words
and
in
operation,
the
statutes
could
not
work
together
because
of
the
time
for
requesting
manual
recounts,
the
extent
of
the
job
of
manual
recounts--
mr.
paul
hancock
--it's
102.
--well,
102.166
authorizes
manual
recounts.
mr.
paul
hancock
yes,
but
once
it
starts,
justice
scalia,
once
it's
authorized,
if
the
initial
sample
recount
shows
an
error
that
might
effect
the
outcome
of
the
election--
mr.
paul
hancock
--the
board
is
then
required
to,
among
other
things,
conduct
a
full
manual
recount.
mr.
paul
hancock
yes.
the
problem
faced
by
the
counties--
mr.
paul
hancock
--the
statute
requires
that
the
election
officials
attempt
to
discern
the
cause
of
the
error.
here
the
cause
of
the
error
was
that,
in
these
counties,
was
that
the
machines
were
not
able
to
read
ballots,
10,000
ballots
in
palm
beach
county,
the
machine
did
not
read
as
including
a
vote
for
president.
that
was
the
issue
so
that
the
solution
to
that
was
not
the
machines,
even
when
they're
operating
properly
would
not
read
these
ballots,
so
what
was
left
of
the
county
canvassing
boards
then
was
to
do
the
full
manual
recount,
and
the
language
of
that
statute
again
says
they
shall
do
a
full
manual
recount
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
paul
hancock
yes,
justice
o'connor,
but,
again
these...
under
the
law
these
requests
can
be
made
up
to
the
time
of
canvassing...
that
means
up
to
six
or
seven
days...
and
also
the
number
of
ballots
at
issue
here
are
between
650,000
in
palm
beach
county
and
also
900,000,
up
to
900,000
in
broward
county.
mr.
paul
hancock
well,
let
me--
mr.
paul
hancock
--the
supreme
court
tried
to
blend
it
all
together
to
make
it
work,
justice
scalia,
and
again
it
came
up
with
a
solution.
the
secretary
of
state's
argument
here
is
based
on...
the
secretary
of
state
herself
recognized
that
she
had
the
discretion
under
florida
law
to
accept
returns
filed
outside
of
that
seven-day
deadline.
a
breakdown
of
the
machines,
in
her
view,
would
justify
late
returns.
a
failure
of
the
machines
to
read
ballots
would
not
justify
late-filed
returns.
the
supreme
court
said
that
the
legal
standard
she
was
using
was
wrong.
that...
we
submit
that
that
decision
of
the
supreme
court
is
the
law
in
the
state
of
florida.
mr.
paul
hancock
well,
i
don't
need
the
extension
time,
your
honor.
if
there's
no
other
questions,
i
will
stop.
thank
you.
