mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
i
would
want
to
note
at
the
outset
that
the
alleged
due
process
violation
which
keeps
puffing
up
and
then
disappearing
and
has
as
far
as
i
can
tell
not
appeared
at
the
state
supreme
court,
did
make
one
appearance
in
the
reply
brief
here,
is
really
not
before
the
court,
and
for
understandable
reasons,
because
although
it
is
part
of
the
popular
culture
to
talk
about
how
unfair
it
is
to
change
the
rules
of
the
game,
i
think
that
misses
the
point
when
the
game
is
over,
and
when
it's
over
in
a
kind
of
photo
finish
that
leaves
people
unsure
who
won,
and
then
the
question
is,
how
do
you
develop
great,
sort
of
greater
certainty,
and
a
rather
common
technique
is
a
recount,
sometimes
a
manual
recount,
sometimes
taking
more
time
would
be
rather
like
looking
more
closely
at
the
film
of
a
photo
finish.
it's
nothing
extraordinary.
it's
not
like
suddenly
moving
heartbreak
hill
or
adding
a
mile
or
subtracting
a
mile--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
no.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
certainly
not,
justice
kennedy,
but
i
read
u.s.c.
section
5...
that
is
3
u.s.c.
section
5
not
as
a
requirement
that,
for
example,
one
never
add
resources
to
checking
how
a
particular
ballot
was
cast.
if
you
look
at
the
language,
i
think
it's
really
much
too
casual
to
say
of
it
that
all
of
the
laws
must
stay
fixed
in
order
to
have
the
safe
harbor
apply.
as
i'll
try
to
argue
in
a
few
minutes,
that's
not
really
a
question
for
this
court,
but
for
the
congress,
but
the
language
of
section
5
is
that...
and
i'll
just
read
what
i
think
are
the
key
words,
"if
a
state
#"--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--actually,
i'm
just
reading
from
a
copy
of
the
u.s.
code,
3
u.s.c.
section
5,
not
from
any...
the
page
i
can
identify--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes,
although
i'm
afraid
i
don't
have
it
in
front
of
me.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you,
justice
souter.
page
3a
of
the
blue
brief,
i
am
reliably
informed.
so
if
any
state--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
tried.
i
tried.
if
any
state
shall
have
provided,
and
then
it
says
by
laws
enacted
prior
to
the
day
fixed
for
the
appointment
of
the
electors,
a
fancy
way
of
saying
election
day,
for
the
final
determination
of
any
controversy
or
contest
about
the
appointment
of
electors...
and
here's
the
key
phrase,
i
think...
by
judicial
or
other
methods
or
procedures
at
least
six
days
before
the
time
fixed
for
the
meeting
of
the
electors,
that
means
in
our
situation,
december
12,
then
the
final
determination
shall
be
conclusive
and
govern
the
counting
in
congress.
now,
the
question
for
congress,
i
suppose,
would
be,
although
i
don't
see
how
this
court
could
get
into
that
question
at
this
stage,
but
the
question
would
be,
is
a
particular
change
extending
a
deadline
for
exigent
circumstances
because
a
recount
has
been
authorized,
a
change
in
the
judicial
or
methods
of
procedures
for
resolving
the
contest.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
just
that
i
don't
trust
my
own
imagination
to
have
exhausted
all
possibilities.
for
example,
in
the
case
in,
i
think
it
was
1890,
in
fitzgerald
v.
green
when
this
court
held
that
only
states
can
punish
fraudulent
voting
for
presidential
electors,
it
got
into
the
act
sort
of
obliquely
and
at
an
angle,
and
that
had
a
bearing
on
the
question
of
how
the
presidential
electoral
slate
might
be
composed,
but
it
certainly
didn't
get
into
this.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
very.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
certainly
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
justice
kennedy,
first
of
all
i
do
want
to
be
clear
that
in
our
view
the
question
of
whether
and
when
and
how
the
florida
legislature
can
enter
the
picture
is
in
no
way
presented
here.
that
paragraph
was
intended
to
suggest
that
it's
not
obvious
that
the
views
of
some
that
there's
no
problem
is
right.
secondly,
if
it
were
the
case
that
the
florida
legislature
could
not
simply
decide,
well,
we're
tired
of
all
this
counting,
we're
moving
in,
and
that
this
court
cannot
decide
whether
the
conditions
of
3
u.s.c.
section
5
are
met,
it
would
then
remain
only
for
congress
to
make
a
determination
and
adding
the
florida
legislature
would
not,
after
all,
have
added
an
adjudication.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
perhaps,
justice
kennedy,
but
i
frankly
can't
see
how
it
would
affect
the
decision
in
this
case.
after
all,
you
have
before
you
a
judgment
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state.
as
justice
ginsburg
and
others
have
suggested,
it
would
ordinarily
be
the
case,
surely,
that
one
would
not
go
out
of
one's
way
to
read
the
judgment
as
a
breach
of
faith
with
the
duties
of
trying
to
reconcile
provisions
that
are--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
justice
o'connor,
i
certainly
agree
that
if
the
florida
supreme
court
adverted
to
3
u.s.c.
section
5,
and
as
justice
kennedy
asked
earlier,
got
it
wrong,
then
there
would
be
a
federal
issue
for
this
court.
would
it
be,
i
wonder,
a
federal
issue--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no.
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
would
be
nice.
but
remember
it
is--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--but,
justice
o'connor,
under
article
ii,
section
1,
clause
2,
the
authority
to
regulate
the
manner
of
the
choice
of
electors
is
vested
in
the
state
legislature.
if
the
state
legislature
decides
from
the
beginning
to
exercise
that
authority
by
instructing
the
various
institutions,
certainly
not
just
the
courts,
the
attorney
general,
the
secretary
of
state,
in
very
particular
ways
to
exercise
their
roles
in
the
process,
with
a
specific
view
of--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
suppose
it
could
be
a
violation
of
florida
law
if
the
enactment
of
that
date
is
construed
as
a
direction
to
a
particular
authority
like
the
secretary
of
state
or
the
state's
highest
court
to
take
certain
actions
in
order
to
get
the
benefit
of
this
bonus,
but
only
a
violation
of
federal
law.
i
don't
see
how
you
got
a--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--of
state
law.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
it
might
have
been
a
violation--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
federal
question,
which
is
really
what
brings
us
here,
can
only
arise
if
3
u.s.c.
section
5
is
something
other
than
what
mr.
olson
called
the
indemnification
of
the
state.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right,
if
one
concluded
that
florida
had
violated
its
duty
to
empower
the
legislature
to
take
these
regulatory
steps.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
that's
possible,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
the
judgment
before
you
doesn't
provide
even
an
inkling,
i
think
of
proof
about
those
matters.
all
we
have--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
think
we
have
been
arguing
several
interrelated
things.
one
of
the
things
we
have
been
arguing
is
whether
one
could
in
good
faith
reach
the
conclusion,
novel
as
it
was
in
some
respects,
as
justice
o'connor
points
out,
that
the
florida
supreme
court
reached.
now,
if
the
answer
to
that
question
was
no,
perhaps
if
there
were
a
due
process
issue
in
this
case,
and
if
someone
had
a
protectable
interest
that
was
injured,
that
would
be
relevant.
but
the
federal
question
that
makes
that
relevant
here
would
arise
only
if
one
forgot
that
3
u.s.c.
section
5
is
all
carrot
and
no
stick.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
that
they
can
never
advert
to
their
own
constitution?
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
what
would
it
be,
i
wonder,
about
the
circumstances
here
that
would
say
that
in
reconciling
these
provisions
which
at
first
we
were
told
were
mandatory,
then
we
were
told
they
are
not
mandatory,
they
give
discretion,
and
now
we
are
told
that
the
real
issue
is
simply
did
the
court
in
putting
a
boundary
on
that
discretion,
do
something
federally
impermissible.
what
would
it
be
about
that
sequence
that
would
implicate--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it
seems
to
me
that
as
a
tiebreaker,
as
a
way
of
shedding
light
on
the
provisions
that
are
in
conflict,
so
long
as
it's
not
done
in
a
way
that
conflicts
with
a
federal
mandate,
they
are
not
violating
any--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it
seems
to
me
that
it's
already
been
conceded
that
the
legislature
can
delegate
that
function
to
the
judiciary.
and
when
justice
kennedy
asked
if
it
can
delegate
the
function
to
the
judiciary,
and
that
is
what
mcpherson
seems
to
suggest,
then
can
it
not
delegate
something
less,
that
is,
can
it
not
give
the
judiciary
a
role
of
the
sort
that
it's
exercising
here?
after
all,
the
legislature,
and
this
is
important...
it's
not
true
in
every
state...
the
legislature
itself
repromulgates
the
constitution
every
several
years
and
then
it's
ratified
by
the
people.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
fully
accept
that
view,
justice
souter.
i'd
supplement
it
with
one
important
point.
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
a
decision
in
which
within
the
gray
area
where
a
court
could
reasonably
go
either
way,
this
court
simply
said
we
don't
care
about
these
federal
considerations.
it
in
particular
exercised
its
equitable
powers
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
in
order
to
facilitate
meeting
the
december
12
deadline
while
still
being
able
to
have
electoral
contests.
that
december
12
deadline
comes
purely
from
federal
law.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
that
makes
sense.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
might
be
different.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
certainly
don't
think
they
have
done
the
third.
they
did
not
say...
i
think
when
they
underscored
the
presence
of
language
that
justice
scalia
read
about
what's
mandatory,
they
were
simply
being
candid
about
the
fact
that
they
were
acting
in
conflict
with
one
part
of
the
statute,
but
the
adjacent--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--justice
scalia--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--justice
scalia,
both
you
and
i
think
at
one
point
justice
o'connor,
in
pointing
to
the
particular
dates
that
came
out
differently
under
the
approach
that
this
court
used
from
what
would
have
emerged
if
they
had
looked
only
at
102.111
are
making
a
mistake,
with
all
respect.
it's
not
as
though
this
court
promulgated
a
rule
for
the
future
about
december
7th
in
commemoration
of
pearl
harbor,
we
say
december
7
is
the
day.
no.
what
they
did
was
say
we
have
to
find
a
date
which
will
accommodate
these
conflicting
statutory
provisions
and
policies
in
light
of
what
our
constitution
tells
us,
and
we
surely...
it
would
amaze,
i
would
think
amaze
this
court
to
see
anyone
saying
that
because
an
opinion
was
organized
under
roman
numeral
headings--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--in
such
a
way
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--absolutely.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right,
and
surely--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--exactly.
and
i
guess
to
take
a
broad--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--especially,
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
when
the
odds
that
these
conceivable
federal
problems
are
indispensable
to
this
result,
are
overwhelmingly
negative.
it's
not
as
though
one
cannot
explain
the
result
this
court
reached
in
the
most
conventional
standard
ways,
and
the
fact
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--justice
scalia,
i
can
do
a
little
better
than
find
a
sentence.
the
entire
structure
of
that
part
of
the
opinion,
as
justice
stevens
points
out,
would
be
incoherent
if
the
constitution
was
decisive.
that
is
the
highest
law
in
florida.
why
bother
with
all
the
rest
if
that
is
anything
more
than
an
interpretive
guide.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but,
justice
scalia--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--they
also
say
that
the
provision
that
reaches
the
result
that
conflicts
with
the
authorized
recounts
was
written
in
1951,
that
in
1989
they
wrote
a
provision
that
unmistakably
created
discretion,
and
we
haven't
yet
discussed
this
provision,
also
created
the
provision
that
when
the
returns
are
filed
late,
it
doesn't
say
throw
them
away,
it
doesn't
say
give
them
back,
it
says
fine
every
member
of
the
canvassing
board
$200
a
day.
that
would
be
a
totally
crazy
provision.
as
this
opinion
understands,
if
you
were
not
to
reach
a
reconciliation
of
this
sort,
this
result
was
overdetermined
under
florida
law.
it
might
be
true
that
they
said
the
constitution
also
points
this
way,
but
there
isn't
a
sentence
in
the
opinion
that
suggests
that
without
that
constitutional
argument
the
result
would
have
to
be
different.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
it
looks
to
me
like
an
exercise
of
the
chancellor's
foot,
as
it
were,
in
this
particular
case.
when
i
saw
the
date,
november
26th,
i
couldn't
come
up
with
an
algorithm
or
a
formula
that
would
generate
it,
but
the
court
was
confronted
with
the
task
of
drawing,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
what
are
sometimes
inevitably
arbitrary
lines;
that
is,
it
said
it
was
not
consistent
with
the
overall
scheme
of
the
statute
to
require
these
recounts,
which
had
just
begun,
to
terminate.
that
truly
would
be
a
promise
to
the
ear
to
be
broken
to
the
hope,
like
a
munificent
bequest,
justice
jackson
said--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--in
the
pauper's
will.
why
tell
people
the
count
if
you
won't
count
it?
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i...
honestly,
justice
kennedy,
i'm
not
sure
because
the
language
that
i
quoted
from
3
u.s.c.
section
5
focuses
on
the
institutional
dispute
resolution
arrangement
that
is
in
place,
and
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
in
the
decade
of
hearings
in
the
period
after
the
hayes-tilden
debacle,
that
history
focused
on
the
importance
of
having
a
fixed
tribunal
which
you
could
look
to
rather
than
one
cooked
up
at
the
last
moment,
and
indeed
what
they
seem
to
be
most
afraid
of
was
the
political
entry
of
legislators
and
executives
at
the
11th
hour.
there
was
no
focus
at
all.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
there
are
certainly
no
cases
on
the
subject.
the
language
gives
me
very
little
guidance.
since
the
section
is
addressed
to
congress,
neither
my
opinion
about
it
nor
the
court's
opinion
is
necessarily--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think
i
would
advise
the
congress
that
it
is
not
a
new
enactment,
that
it
is
an
entirely
reasonable
construction
of
an
existing
enactment
as
to
which
the
only
alternative
construction
is
to
make
it
self-destruct,
and
to
make
it
internally
contradictory,
and
i
honestly
don't
think
if
i
were
advising
congress
that
i
would
say
it's
a
new
construction.
i
do
think,
also,
that
some
people
reasonably
could
argue
the
contrary,
and
i
guess
i
think
that
this
language
should
be
interpreted
whether
by
a
court
or
by
congress
in
a
way
that
gives
some
deference
to
the
state
government
and
its
organs,
and
i
think
any
degree
of
deference
here
is
inconsistent
with
saying
that
there's
been
a
federal
violation,
especially
when...
i
want
to
remind
us
all
about
the
context.
are
we
going
to
say
that
this
paragraph
in
this
opinion
says
that
florida
is
in
breach
of
article
ii
of
the
constitution
in
general?
hard
to
say.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes,
but
if
the
legislature
is
entirely
happy
not
to
completely
delegate
this
power
to
the
courts,
which
article
ii
would
permit,
but
rather
to
allow
the
courts
to
exercise
a
somewhat
more
flexible
role
than
the
one
that
the
critic
of
this
opinion
would
be
embracing.
that's
within
the
power
of
the
legislature
of
florida.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
anyone.
if
you
just
read
the
statute
in
1989
and
it
says
may.
it
says
she
may
reject
the
late
returns.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
the
date
is
the
one
from
which
the
may
is
measured.
that
is,
you're
supposed
to
get
it
in
by
seven
days
later.
what
if
you
don't?
well,
if
you
don't,
she
may
or
she
may
not
reject
them.
now,
anybody
reading
that
would
realize
that's
a
deadline
only
in
a
kind
of
pickwickian
sense.
it's
not
a
real
deadline.
she's
got
discretion.
certainly
if
there's
an
act
of
god
of
the
sort
justice...
was
it
justice
stevens...
asked
about--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--and
it's
an
entirely
normal
exercise
of
judicial
interpretation
to
say
that
this
statute
is
not
limited
to
god
and
machines.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
have
to
say
my
experience
parallels
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the
odd
thing
is
that
the
system
in
florida
involves
their
own
repromulgation
of
the
constitution,
and
their
scheme
with
respect
to
the
resolution
of
disputes
over
elections
draws
a
sharp
distinction
between
elections
to
their
own
house
and
senate,
which
they
won't
trust
the
courts
with
as
far
as
they
can
throw
them.
those
are
to
be
resolved
exclusively
in
the
house
and
senate,
and
all
others
are
to
be
resolved
in
the
courts
under
a
standard
that
they
understandably
preferred.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
suppose
if
they
were
at
all
far-sighted,
if
they
looked
at
their
own
work
and
saw
how
self-contradictory
it
was,
they
might
say
we
would
want
someone
with
the
authority
to
reconcile
these
provisions
to
do
so
in
the
light
not
only
of
the
literal
language
but
of
the
fact
that
they
are
dealing
with
something
very
important,
the
franchise,
that
disenfranchising
people,
which
is
what
this
is
all
about,
disenfranchising
people
isn't
very
nice.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
it
violates
the
federal
as
well
as
the
state
constitution.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
it's
not
uncommon,
given
the
convenience
of
having
similar
regulations
apply
on
election
day
not
to
bifurcate.
oregon
v.
mitchell,
after
all,
confronted
the
nation
with
a
problem--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--and
they
would
recognize
that
when
the
federal
election
involved
the
presidency
of
the
united
states
with
the
special
problems
of
the
electoral
college
deadline,
they
might
emerge
with
rather
different
deadlines
and
to
some
extent
a
different
approach
for
the...
two
elections.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes.
that's...
that's
entirely
true.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
there
is
an
administrative
order--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
there
is
a
consent
decree
arising
out
of
federal
law.
there
was
the
federal
general
statute--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
right.
in
1986,
there
was
a
congressional
statute
that
already
created
that
difference.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no.
no,
i
certainly
don't
think
so.
they
cut
out
judicial
review...
even
this
may
not
be
entirely
consistent
with
the
florida
constitution.
they
cut
out
judicial
review
for
the
election
of
their
own
members
in
the
house
and
senate.
i
certainly
don't
think
they
would
have
the
authority
to
expel
the
federal
judiciary
from
the
election
of
senators
and
representatives.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i'm
not
actually
clear
about
that,
justice
ginsburg.
i
have
thought
about
it
a
lot.
it
seems
to
me
that
under
smiley
v.
holm
and
similar
cases,
the
general
principle
is
that
the
constitution
takes
the
state
government
and
its
arrangement
as
it
finds
it,
and
that
when
the
legislature
is
identified,
that
really
does
not
mean
the
legislature
in
some
specialized
capacity,
as
with
article
v.
now,
if
that's
the
case
and
if
it's
therefore
assumed
that
the
legislature
is
surrounded
with
both
executive
and
judicial
authority,
then
a
decision
by
the
legislature
to
completely
exclude
the
judiciary
from
any
possible
role,
the
state
judiciary,
might
be
inconsistent
with
the
underlying
meaning
of
article
ii
itself.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i'm
not
sure.
that's
very
much
like
my
inability
to
answer
because
i
honestly
have
not
reached
a
conclusion
that
it's
not
presented
by
this
case.
i
don't
know
whether
the
legislature
could
do
the
further
thing
of
naming
electors,
and
if
it
doesn't
do
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
