justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
olson,
your...
your
submission
is
based
on
the
premise
that
the
florida
court
overturned
something
that
the
statute
did
not.
is
it
not
arguable,
at
least,
that
all
they
did
was
fill
gaps
that
had
not
been
addressed
before?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
and
the
first
one
was
the
mandatory...
is
it
your
view
still
that
the
shall
date
controls
in
all
respects?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean
if
there
were
an
act
of
god
that
prevented
the
returns
from
being
filed
that
she
would
have
discretion
either
to
accept
or
reject
the
returns?
justice
john
paul
stevens
she
would
have
the
discretion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
she
be
compelled
in
that
event
to
accept
the
returns?
justice
john
paul
stevens
she
has
the
total
discretion
either
to
accept
or
reject?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
circumstance
in
which
she
would
be
compelled
to
accept
a
late
return?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
are
arguing
in
effect
that
it's
a
mandatory
deadline.
i
wonder
if
you
really
mean
it's
mandatory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't
know
whether
it's
mandatory
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
one
of
the
things
that's
of
interest
to
me
is
the
extent
to
which
you
say
there
was
a
change
in
the
law.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
order
to
answer
that
question
you
have
to
know
what
your
view
of
the
law
was
before
this
all
happened.
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
any
circumstance
it
was
not
must?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
in
an
act
of
god
or
fraud?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
olson,
on
the
equitable
powers,
they
were
doing
that
in
setting
a
new
deadline,
and
i
don't
think
you
would
argue
the
case
would
have
been
more
acceptable
if
there
had
been
no
deadline?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
on
the
fight
between
may
and
shall,
they
relied
on
four
traditional
canons
of
statutory
construction
and
not
equity
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
she
said
she
would
exercise
her
discretion.
did
she
say
she
would
have
to
exercise
her
discretion
in
those
conditions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
court
could
compel
her
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that
was
clear
before
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
one
general
question
for
your
comment
on
whether
it's
a
change
in
the
law.
to
what
extent,
in
your
view,
was
the...
did
the
supreme
court
of
florida
consider
itself
bound
by
either
prior
precedent
or
the
constitution
of
the
state
which
preexisted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
terms
of
the
particular
result
it
reached
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
they
thought
their
decision
was
dictated
either
by
prior
precedent
or
by
the
constitution
of
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
your
position
is
that
was
entirely
new?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
wondering,
therefore
your
submission
is
that
it
was
not
dictated
by
the
constitution
or
by
prior
precedent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
professor
tribe--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--isn't
it
also
true,
professor
tribe,
that
part
8
of
the
opinion
relies
on
four
things...
the
florida
constitution,
earlier
florida
decisions
construing
statutes,
an
illinois
case,
and
a
federal
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
just
their
constitution.
