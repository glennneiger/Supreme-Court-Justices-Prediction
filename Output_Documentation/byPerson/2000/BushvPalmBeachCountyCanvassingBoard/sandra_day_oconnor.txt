justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
olson,
isn't
section
5
sort
of
a
safe
harbor
provision
for
states,
and
do
you
think
that
it
gives
some
independent
right
of
a
candidate
to
overturn
a
florida
decision
based
on
that
section?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
but
i
would
have
thought
it
was
a
section
designed
in
the
case
of,
some
election
contest
ends
up
before
the
congress,
a
factor
that
the
congress
can
look
at
in
resolving
such
a
dispute.
i
just
don't
quite
understand
how
it
would
be
independently
enforceable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
olson,
i'd
like
to
get
focused
a
little
more
on
this
same
area.
if
it
were
purely
a
matter
of
state
law,
i
suppose
we
normally
would
leave
it
alone
where
the
state
supreme
court
found
it,
and
so
you
probably
have
to
persuade
us
there
is
some
issue
of
federal
law
here.
otherwise,
why
are
we
acting?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
are
you
relying
in
that
regard
on
title
2?
i
mean,
would
you
like
to...
article
ii?
would
you
like
to
characterize
the
federal
issue
that
you
think
governs
this?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
article
ii
permits
the
legislature
in
general
to
make
a
choice
that
it
could
itself
select
the
electors?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
certainly
the
date
changed.
that
is
a
dramatic
change.
the
date
for
certification,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
was
done
by
the
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
legislature
had
very
clearly
said,
you
know,
seven
days
after,
that's
the
date,
and
it
just
does
look
like
a
very
dramatic
change
made
by
the
florida
court,
and
i'm
wondering
if
that
is
consistent
in
fact
with
the
notion,
expressed
at
least
in
section
5,
so
that
the
result
would
be
if
it
did
go
to
congress,
it
would
be
a
change.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
says
that
the
board
may
authorize
the
manual
recount,
it
doesn't
require
it.
if
it
does
authorize
it,
then
it
tells
it
how
to
do
it
and
says
they
shall
appoint
as
many
counting
teams
as
necessary,
presumably
as
necessary
to
do
it
within
the
time
limit.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
in
the
area,
though,
of
presidential
electors
it
could
be
that
that
court,
as
all
courts
would
be,
have
to
be
informed,
at
least,
by
the
provisions
of
section
5
in
reviewing
the
laws
enacted
by
the
legislature
of
the
state.
i
mean,
it
had
to
register
somehow
with
the
florida
courts
that
that
statute
was
there
and
that
it
might
be
in
the
state's
best
interest
not
to
go
around
changing
the
law
after
the
election.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
there
a
federal
issue
if
the
court
doesn't--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--advert
to
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
of
article
ii,
which,
after
all,
does
give
the
legislature
plenary
power
and
must
have
wanted...
it
must
have
wanted
to
have
the
laws
in
place
so
that
it
wasn't...
so
that
florida
wouldn't
risk
losing
its
electoral
votes.
i
mean,
the
legislature
had
to
want
that
by
enacting
laws,
and
perhaps
the
florida
court
has
to
be
aware
of
the
consequences
to
the
state
of
changing
the
rules.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
certainly
did
by
enacting
that
date.
here
is
the
certification
date.
how
could
it
have
been
clearer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
should
perhaps
be
some
deference,
though,
to
the
concept
expressed
in
article
ii,
that
it
is
the
authority
of
the
legislature
and
some
special
concern
about
what
the
legislature
may
have
said.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
but
who
would
have
thought
that
the
legislature
was
leaving
open
the
date
for
change
by
the
court?
who
would
have
thought
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
well,
then
the
secretary
came
in
and
argued
and
said,
yes,
her
discretion
was
if
it
were
an
act
of
god
or
a
machine
breakdown
she
would
exercise
her
discretion.
