justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
agree
that
your
argument
is
stronger...
let's
assume
that
the
statute
does
not
incorporate
slayer
statutes,
or
simultaneous
death
statutes--
justice
david
h.
souter
--or
simultaneous
death
rules.
would
you
agree
that
your
argument
is
much
stronger
than
if
you
rely
on
conflict
preemption
than
if
you
rely
on
statutory
relating-to
preemption?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
it's
a
flat
conflict
preemption,
it
seems
to
me
relatively
easy
for
us
to
say,
look,
the
statute
says,
beneficiaries
or
plans
designate
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--participants
or
plans
designate
beneficiaries.
this
says
they
don't.
clear
conflict.
but
if
you
get
to
relating-to
preemption,
which
we
do
not
find
it
easy
to
understand,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
force
of
the
argument
for
anomalous
results
which
my
colleagues
were
making
is
simply
a
stronger
argument,
because
the
concept
of
preemption
is
a
comparatively
weaker
concept.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe
it
is,
but
i
guess
the
point
that
i
don't
seem
to
grasp
is
why
it
makes
a
dime's
worth
of
difference.
we've
got
a
statute.
if
the
statute
means
what
they
say
it
does,
you
lose.
if
it
doesn't,
maybe
you
win,
but
the
particular
expectations
of
the
parties
in
a
particular
divorce,
even
if
there's
an
evidentiary
basis
for
it,
seems
to
me
irrelevant.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
i
was
referring
to
the
definition
of
beneficiary
as
being
the
individual
designated
by
the
participant
or
by
the
plan,
and
i
thought
there
was
an
apparent
conflict
between
that
and
any
statute
which
in
effect
superseded
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
two
things...
excuse
me.
two
things
occur
to
me.
one
is,
doesn't...
first
i
guess
is,
just
as
a
matter
of
washington
law,
the
children
don't
become
entitled
under
the
plan.
they
end
up
becoming
entitled,
if
they
are
entitled
at
all,
under
the
washington...
under
the
state
law
of
washington.
and
number
2,
would
you
comment
on
what
i
speculated
when
i
read
that
last
phrase,
who
are
or
may
become
entitled.
i
assumed
that
that
last
phrase
was
referring
to,
in
effect,
a
contingent
designation.
you
know,
to
b
or
a
c
if
b
dies
first,
something
like
that.
c
would
be,
may
become
entitled--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
i
thought
that
was
all
it
was
referring
to.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
form
is,
first
becomes
disentitled--
justice
david
h.
souter
--we
agree
with
that,
and
isn't
that
enough
for
the
conflict?
justice
david
h.
souter
because
the
participant,
or
the
plan...
i
guess
the
participant
in
this
case...
is
designated
and
the
statute
says
no,
that
designation
is
not
operative.
isn't
that
a
conflict?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
erisa
says,
sure,
but
erisa
says,
by
means
of
the
definition
section,
pay
the
beneficiary,
who
is
the
designee
either
of
the
participant
or
of
the
plan.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
are
if
you
first
assume
there
is
no
conflict
and
therefore
the
statute
prevails.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's...
i
mean,
that
seems
to
me
a
circularity
in
your
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
it's
also
the
case
that
the...
and
i
will
assume
the
premise
of
your
argument
that
there
may
be
a
considerable
class
of
individuals
who
may
object
to
plan
administration.
it
does
not
follow
from
that
that
every
one
of
those
individuals
in
fact
gets
some
money
in
the
pocket
at
the
point
of
distribution.
