ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
washington
statute
relates
to
employee
benefit
plans
within
the
meaning
of
erisa's
express
preemption
provision
and
also
conflicts
with
several
specific
provisions
with
erisa.
accordingly,
whether
viewed
as
a
matter
of
express
preemption,
conflict
preemption,
or
appeal
preemption,
the
washington
statute
in
its
application
to
erisa
plans
is
preempted.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
as
a
practical
matter,
they
may
do
essentially
the
same
thing
interpreting
the
terms
of
the
plan,
or
whatever
instrument
governs
it.
the
key
question
is
what
happens
after
the
plan
makes
the
decision
in
the
erisa
context.
that
decision
is
subject
to
review
and
an
action
under
erisa
section
502(a).
in
that
sort
of
action
the
federal
court
would
apply
common
law.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
in
many
instances
the
appropriate
rule
would
presumably
be
for
the
plan
administrator
of
the
erisa
plan
to
look
to
state
law
for
guidance,
for
example,
in
determining
who
was
a
spouse,
who
was
a
child,
et
cetera.
it
would
only
make
sense
for
the
erisa
plan
to
essentially
require
looking
to
the
relevant
state
law
that
creates
the
relationship.
that's
not
so,
however,
where
the
state
law
is
one
that
conflicts
with
the
provisions
of
an
erisa
plan
such
as
the
one
here,
which--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--yes,
it
is.
it
refers
to
insurance,
but
it's
more
general.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no,
we
shouldn't--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--in
the
first
place,
we
don't
know
his
wishes.
in
the
second
place--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--this
individual
in
fact
was
not
represented.
it
was
a
pro
se
divorce.
one
would
assume
that
a
participant
in
an
erisa
plan
would
look
at
a
variety
of
sources,
most
specifically
including
his
summary
plan
description,
which
in
this
case
made
quite
clear
that
the
only
way
to
change
a
beneficiary
is
to
file
the
required
form,
that
such
documents
as
divorce
decrees
would
not--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--i
don't
think
there's
any
way
to
say
what
the
plan
participant
intended
at
this
point.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
certainly
there
is
the
possibility
under
erisa
to
obtain
a
qualified
domestic
relations
order.
in
this
case
the
children's
interests
could
have
been
protected
if
such
an
order
had
been
obtained
at
any
point
in
the
process
since
the
first
wife's
divorce.
that
wasn't
done.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
my
point
is,
we
don't
know,
and
an
erisa
plan--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
that's
a
sensible
approach,
and
erisa
plans
could
adopt
that
approach--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--that's
correct,
and
in
many
instances--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
[laughter]
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--and
you
might
in
fact
have
a
malpractice
action.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
you
began
your
question
with
a
reference
to
what
congress
would
have
intended
here,
and
we
do
know
that
congress
intended
to
permit
the
nationally
uniform
administration
of
erisa
plans.
that's
why
it
included
an
express
preemption
provision.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
that's
true,
and
perhaps
the
more
common
situation
is
where
the
divorced
spouse
has
custody
of
the
couple's
children.
in
that
case,
it
would
probably
be
a
matter
of
relative
indifference
to
the
plan
participant
whether
the
money
went
to
the
spouse
directly
or
the
children,
or--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--she
may
well
do
so,
although
she
would
know
that
at
the
time
of
their
divorce
the...
her
spouse
would
be
free
to--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--with
respect
to
express
conflict
preemption
there
are
several
provisions
of
erisa
that
we
submit
conflict
with
the
washington
statute.
one
is
the
provision
that
requires
that
plans
be
administered
in
accordance
with
plan
documents.
the
plan
documents,
in
this
case,
require
payment
to
the
beneficiary
designated
by
the
plan
participant,
rather
than
by
somebody
designated
under
state
law.
it
also
conflicts
with
erisa's
definition
of
beneficiary
as
the
person
designated
by
the
participant
or
under
the
terms
of
the
plan.
if
one
looks
to
the
participant's
designation
and
the
terms
of
the
plan,
petitioner
here
is
the
proper
beneficiary,
not
respondent.
with
respect
to
the
pension
plan,
the
washington
statute
also
conflicts
with
erisa's
antialienation
provision,
which
prohibits
the
assignment
or
alienation
of
plan
benefits.
this
statute
affects
an
assignment
or
alienation
of
benefits
by
transferring
a
right
to
benefits
from
the
petitioner's
former
spouse.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
we
would
submit
that
the
slayer
statutes
and
the
underlying
slayer
rule
and
the
federal
common
law
reflect
a
public
policy
limitation
that
erisa
plans
would
not
be
free
to--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--that's
correct.
if
there
are
no
further--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--and
the
husband
doesn't
do
it?
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
our
position
is
that
under
erisa
one
would
continue
to
enforce
the
terms
of
the
plan,
just
as
in
this
case.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
there
may
be
a
separate
sort
of
action
in
that
situation
under
state
law.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes,
you're
correct.
it
might
be
recognized
as
a
qdro--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--that's
correct,
it
could
constitute
a
qdro,
depending
on
whether
it
meets
the
procedural
requirements.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct,
and
presumably
the
children
with
an
interest
in
the
benefits
would
do
that.
thank
you.
