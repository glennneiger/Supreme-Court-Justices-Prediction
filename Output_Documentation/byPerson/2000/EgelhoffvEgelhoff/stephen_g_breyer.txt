justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
what
you
say
applies
exactly
similarly,
i
take
it,
to
a
state
statute
that
would
say,
if
a
murders
b,
a
shall
be
treated
as
having
predeceased
b
for
purposes
of
inheriting
from
b,
or
in
a
word,
a
can't
inherit
from
b.
all
that
you've
said
would
apply
to
that
similarly,
so
what's
the
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
you're
saying
that
basically
this
erisa
preempts
all
of
what
you
call
the
slayer
statutes,
i
guess,
that
traditionally
have
said
you
can't
inherit
from
a
person
you
murder.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
does
it
also
incorporate
statutes
where
people
die
simultaneously?
there
are
a
complicated
set
of
state
rules
as
to
how
you
treat
what
assets
for
purposes
of
inheritance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
if
it...
now
we
have
it
interpreting
a
considerable
area
of
state
probate
law.
is
there
any
reason
why
congress
would
have
wanted
erisa
to
preempt
a
traditionally
state-regulated
subject
like
probate
and...
you
know,
at
least
where
it
doesn't
interfere
with
some
important
policy,
or...
i
don't
know.
i
mean,
you
see
the...
that's
what
i
want
you
to
address.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
is...
is
the
answer
that
you
gave
in
talking
about
the
administrative
burden...
my
understanding,
and
correct
me
if
i'm
not
right,
that
this
statute
says
that
if
a
trustee
of
a
plan
doesn't
know
about
this
problem,
he
doesn't
have
to
pay,
and
if
he
does
know
about
the
problem,
he
doesn't
have
to
pay
until
the
state
courts
resolve
it,
and
if
that
isn't
good
enough,
he
can
opt
out
of
the
whole
thing
just
by
putting
a
sentence
in
the
plan
that
says,
i
opt
out,
in
effect.
so
where
is
the
administrative
burden,
and
is
it
the
same...
they
also
say
there
are
47
other
states
that
have
similar
statutes,
and
so
i'm
trying
to
get
an
idea
for
what
this
administrative
burden
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
ordinary
common
sense,
that
a
person
who
just
divorces
his
wife,
gives
her
half
the
property,
might
prefer
that
the
other
half
of
the
property
go
to
his
children,
rather
than
this
wife,
who's
now
going
to
get
more
than
her
fair
share,
and
whom
he's
just
divorced?
i
mean,
suppose
i
thought
the
common
sense
of
it
in
my
knowledge
of
human
nature
is
that
people
would
prefer
their
half
share
to
go
to
their
children
rather
than
the
just-divorced
wife.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
is
there
some
reason...
all
right,
is
there
any...
so
then
is
there
any
reason
to
think
that
congress
wouldn't
have
wanted
state
statutes
that
don't
interfere
that
much
with
anything
and
in
fact
embody
that
common
sense
notion,
like
you
wouldn't
like
your
property
to
go
to
the
guy
who
kills
you.
you
know,
that's
another
common
sense
notion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mine
was
actually
a
question.
i
wasn't
just
making
a
comment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
wanted
you
to
respond
to
the
notion
that
state
statutes,
probate...
you
know,
that
traditional
state
area
that
embody
that
kind
of
a
notion,
what
i'd
call
a
notion
of
trying
to
carry
out
the
wishes
of
the
testator,
or
whoever,
that
those
are
not
preempted
unless
they
impose
a
real
burden
upon
the
erisa
plan.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
this
the
case:
47
states
had
divorce
revocation
when
the
instrument
is
a
will--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
about
20
have
it
when
divorce
revocation
is
a
nonprobate
asset,
and
it's
not
nonuniform...
that
is,
the
states
that
have
it
are
copying
the
uniform
probate
code,
which
has
such
a
provision
in
it?
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
that
is
right,
do
these
20
states
all
say,
or
most
of
them
say,
like
washington,
that
if
you
expressly
deny
the
applicability
of
a
divorce
revocation
statute,
you're
home
free?
do
they
all
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
some
of
them?
they
all
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
do
almost
all
of
them
provide,
as
washington
does,
that
if
a
trustee
doesn't
know
about
a
conflict
among
beneficiaries,
he
needn't
pay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
do
the
majority
also
provide
that
if
the
trustee
does
find
out
about
it
he
also
need
not
pay
until
the
state
courts
resolve
the
matter?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if...
is
there...
you're
asking
us,
i
take
it,
to
interpret
the
statute,
erisa,
which
effectively
says
pay
the
money
to
the
primary
beneficiary.
you
want
to
say,
well,
pay
the
money
to
the
primary
beneficiary
who
is
a
beneficiary
and
isn't
disqualified
by
certain
state
laws,
and
now
this
is
one
of
the
state
laws
that
might
disqualify
a
person,
and
another
one
is
a
slayer
statute,
and
a
third
one,
i
take
it,
is
a
simultaneous
death
statute,
and
are
there
any
others--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
anybody's
been
able
to
think
of?
