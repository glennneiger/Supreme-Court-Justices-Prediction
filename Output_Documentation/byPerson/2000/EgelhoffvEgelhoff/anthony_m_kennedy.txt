i'm
not
sure
about
you...
how
you
distinguish
the
slayer
statute.
you
say
it's
been
around,
it's
part
of
the
common
law,
it's
part
of
the
background.
why...
suppose
the
case
we
have
here
has
been
around
a
long
time.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
not
simultaneous
death
statutes,
because
they
vary
from
state
to
state,
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
your
position
if
in
a
divorce
decree
the
decree
sets
forth
that
the
wife
agrees
to
relinquish
her
interest
in
the
pension
plan
and
that
the
husband
will
name
the
children
as
beneficiary,
and
they
both
agree
to
that?
justice
anthony
m.

then
you
have
this...
then
you
have
this--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
the
children
could
not
bring
a
suit,
because
that
would
be
preempted?
the
suit
would
be
preempted
as
well,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i
thought
the
preemption
of
the
plan--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
qdro
has
to
be
forwarded
to
the
plan
administrator,
i
take
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
just
addressing
the
first,
the
fact
that
the
husband
has
the
property
interest
means
that
he
simply
has
the
power
to
designate
the
beneficiary.
that's
quite
consistent
with
his
wanting
to
let
her
remain
the
beneficiary.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
tab
that
