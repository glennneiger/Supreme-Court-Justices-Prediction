well,
except
your...
i
think
the
point
being
made
is
that
your
preemption
is
stronger
if
you're
willing
to
swallow
the
bitter
pill
of
not
including
the
slayer
statutes,
but
once
you
say
the
slayer
statutes
don't
pose
any
conflict,
it's
hard
to
see
why
they
pose
any
more
of
a
conflict
than...
or,
excuse
me,
any
less
of
a
conflict
than
the
statute
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
there
is
such
a
federal
common
law
i
suppose
we
could
invent
a...
you
know,
the
same
spousal
substitution
rule
that
the
state
has
done
by
statute
here.
i
mean,
if
there
is...
if
we
have
that
common
law
power
to
say,
fill
in
the
interstices
in
statutes--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
mcdowell,
that
common
sense
approach
is
disagreed
with
by
two-thirds
of
the
states,
as
i
understand
it,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
not
that
much
common
sense,
and
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
assume
that
any...
that
once
you
have
a
statute
like
erisa,
which
avowedly
supersedes
state
law,
if
you're
dealing
with
a
lawyer
who
doesn't
consult
erisa
and
knows
nothing
about
erisa
and
gives
you
your
advice
only
on
the
basis
of
state
law,
you're
going
to
get
a
lot
of
bad
advice.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
it
even
more
likely,
instead
of
this
tender-hearted--
justice
antonin
scalia
--divorced
husband,
isn't
it
more
likely
that
the
wife,
in
striking
her
deal
for
the
divorce
settlement,
having
an
erisa
plan,
knowing
there's
an
erisa
plan
which
names
her
as
the
beneficiary,
assumes
that
that's
her
money?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
knowing
that
erisa
supersedes
state
law,
as
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
she
thought
she
got
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
she
had
a
good
lawyer
who
read
erisa--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
said
that,
you
know,
there
is
this
statute,
but
it
ain't
going
to
affect
whether
you
get
your
erisa
payment.
you
have
that
one.
now,
maybe
he
doesn't
know
that,
but
boy,
we're
walking
away
with
a
good
settlement
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
really
can't
predict
what
the
expectations
were.
it's
hard
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
is
it
the
case
that...
does
the
preemption
provision
at
issue
here
say
that
preemption
only
occurs
when
there's
an
administrative
burden
on
the
plan?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
criterion?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
there
is
an
administrative
burden
you
will
be
much
more
likely
to
find
preemption,
but
if,
on
the
face
of
it,
there
is
preemption,
does
there
need
to
be
an
administrative
burden?
justice
antonin
scalia
death
certificates
always
say
whether
you're
divorced
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
page

justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
what
you're
arguing
is
that
it
does
not
pose
a
conflict
with
the
plan
if
you
require
the
plan
to
pay
out
to
a
contingent
beneficiary
instead
of
to
the
main
beneficiary.
i
mean,
the
mere
fact
that
it's
somebody
who
was
not
entitled
to
it,
but
would
be
entitled
to
it
if
the
person
entitled
to
it
weren't
around,
that's
still
a
conflict,
it
seems
to
me.
just
because
they
both
are
called
beneficiaries
of
some
sort,
you're
still
requiring
payment
not
to
the
beneficiary
named.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
spousal
annuity
provision,
i
mean,
the
spouse
at
the
time
of
death
may
not
be
named,
but
it's
clear
on
the
face
of
the
plan
and
the
accompanying
law
of
erisa
that
the
spousal
annuity
goes
to
the
spouse
at
the
time
of
the
beneficiary's
death,
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
that
conflict
with
erisa?
i
mean,
isn't
he
supposed
to
pay
out
the
money
promptly
to
the
person
entitled
to
it,
and
you're
saying
it
doesn't
conflict
with
erisa
to
tell
him
to
sit
on
his
hands
until
litigation
terminates
2
years
hence?
justice
antonin
scalia
do...
i
mean,
one
of
the
ways
they
used
to
regulate
it
is
that,
you
know,
the
wife
would
get
half
the
estate
automatically
upon
death.
suppose
the...
a
state
enacts
a
law
that
says,
you
know,
if
this
benefit
is
not
given
to
the
spouse
at
the
time
of
death,
it
must
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
this
is
probate,
this
is
our
concern
with
the
family
and
with
marriage
and
all
of
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
surely
you
wouldn't
say
that
erisa
would
be
overcome
with
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i
thought
alienation
means.
it
means
from
a
participant.
this
alienation
is
not
from
the
participant.
it's
by
operation
of
the
state
law.
you're
not
getting
it
from
the
participant.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
that
is
an
alienation?
why
is
that
an
alienation?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
david
is
not
alienating
himself.
he's
not
taking
it
from
himself
and
giving
it
to
donna.
i
thought
you
agreed
with
me
that
that's
what
alienate
means.
it
means
you
can't
transfer
it
to
someone
else,
not
that
operation
of
law
can't
take
it
away
from
you
and
give
it
to
somebody
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me,
and
maybe
you
have
an
answer
to
it,
that
the
manner
in
which
this
state
law
differs
from
laws
that
say
who
a
wife
is,
who
a
child
is
and
so
forth,
is
that
this
is
a
state
law
that
is
directed
explicitly
to
the
manner
in
which
a
contract,
an
erisa
contract
in
particular,
should
be
interpreted.
it
is
directed
precisely
to
the
intent
of
the
parties
to
an
agreement,
and
it
says
this
is
what
they
shall
be
deemed
to
intend.
it
operates
directly
and
explicitly
upon
the
agreement
itself.
