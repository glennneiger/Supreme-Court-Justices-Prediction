mr.
william
j.
kilberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
washington
state's
divorce
revocation
law
strikes
at
the
very
heart
of
erisa's
comprehensive
regulatory
scheme
for
employee
benefit
plans.
it
does
so
by
purporting
to
revoke
erisa
plan
beneficiary
designations
upon
divorce.
we
submit
that
the
washington
statute
is
preempted
by
erisa
on
two
independent
grounds.
first,
because
it
relates
to
an
erisa
plan
within
the
meaning
of
erisa's
express
preemption
provision,
section
514(a)
and
second,
because
it
conflicts
with
erisa's
other
provisions.
turning
first
to
section
514,
this
court
has
made
clear
that
a
state
law
relates
to
an
employee
benefit
plan
if
it
mandates
employee
benefit
structures
or
their
administration
or
binds
plan
administrators
to
particular
choices.
washington's
divorce
revocation
statute
has
precisely
that
forbidden
effect.
as
applied
by
the
courts
below,
the
statute
invalidates
the
beneficiary
determination
and
benefit
payment
scheme
provided
for
by
the
terms
of
the
erisa
plans
here
and
instead
mandates
payment
according
to
a
different
state-imposed
scheme.
moreover,
the
determination
of
beneficiary
status,
and
the
payment
of
plan
benefits,
lie
at
the
very
heart
of
erisa's
concerns.
indeed,
the
determination
whether
particular
alleged
beneficiaries
are
entitled
to
obtain
plan
benefits
is
so
crucial
to
the
entire
federal
scheme
created
by
erisa
that
such
benefits
claims
are
deemed
to
arise
under
federal
law
under
this
court's
decision
in
metropolitan
life
v.
taylor
even
if
they
purport
to
raise
only
state
law
claims.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
if
that
were
a
state
law,
then
it
would
be
preempted.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
it
preempts
the
slayer
statutes.
however,
the
slayer
rule
may
very
well
be
incorporated
into
erisa,
because
the
slayer
rule
was
extant
at
the
time
of
erisa's
passage
in
1974,
was
a
common
law
rule,
and
had
been
applied
in
numerous
cases,
federal
cases
with
regard
to
a
death
benefit
statute,
so
it
was
a
gloss
on
the
law.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
it
may
encompass
simultaneous
death,
a
simultaneous
death
rule.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
i
can
imagine
where
you're
headed,
justice
breyer.
yes,
the
answer,
of
course
it
preempts
those
laws.
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
it
doesn't.
we're
talking
about
employee
benefit
plans.
there's
nothing
more
central
to
an
employee
benefit
plan
than
benefits,
how
it
pays
them,
to
whom
it
pays
them,
and
erisa
has
specific
provisions
with
regard
to
the
exception
for
state
law
with...
in
the
context
of
the
payment
employee
benefit
plans
in
a
divorce
situation.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
well,
the
difference,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
the
slayer...
the
slayer
rule
was
part
of
the
common
law,
was
part
of
the
common
law
of
trust
at
the
time
that
erisa
was
enacted,
and
it
may
be
presumed
that
the
congress,
seeing
that
as
a
backdrop,
incorporated,
impliedly
incorporated
the
slayer
rule
into
erisa.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
well,
i'm
not
sure
about
simultaneous
death
statutes,
quite
frankly.
they
may,
too,
have
been
incorporated,
but
with
regard
to
a
divorce
revocation
rule,
that
was
not
the
state
of
the
common
law
in
1974.
indeed,
it's
not
the
state
of
the
law
now.
very
few
states,
fewer
than
a
third
of
the
states
have
any
sort
of
divorce
revocation
rule.
only
10
states
have
developed--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
no,
not
the
statute.
if...
if
the
divorce
revocation
rule
had
been
commonly
accepted
in
the
common
law
at
the
time
erisa
was
passed
and
had
been
used
as
a
gloss--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--on
similar
federal
statutes--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--that's
correct.
well,
it's
really
both,
justice
stevens.
it
is
that
it
is
a
common
law
rule
and
it
was
a
common
law
rule
at
the
time
of
erisa's
passage
in
1974.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
not
with
regard
to
the
slayer
rule,
in
fact,
and
indeed
what
is
important
here
is
that
the
slayer
rule
had
been
applied
in
federal
cases
as
a
gloss
to
death
benefit
statutes,
and
so
one
can
assume
that
the
congress,
or
one
can
rule
that
the
congress
had
impliedly
incorporated
that
common
law
rule
into
erisa.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
with
regard
to
the
slayer
rule,
if
it
had
been
incorporated
into
erisa,
then
it
would
be
incorporated
as
an
implied
exception.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
yes,
they
would
be
responsible
under
those
circumstances.
the
plan
administrator
has
to
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
a
benefit
is
to
be
paid
out.
the
plan
administrator
does
so
by
looking
both
to
erisa
and
to
the
terms
of
the
plan.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
no.
he
would
not
look
at
state
law.
he
would
not
have
to
look
at
state
rules
unless,
not
finding
the
answer
in
his
plan,
and
not
finding
the
answer
in
erisa
he
may
choose
to
look
to
state
law,
but--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--but
we
believe
that
state
law,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
a
state
law
like
this,
which
is
essentially
a
rule
of
decision
for
employee
benefit
plan,
is
preempted
both
as
a
matter
of
express
preemption
and
as
a
matter
of
conflict
preemption
under
erisa.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
yes.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
i
believe
it's
equally
strong.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
participants.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
well,
obviously,
we
believe
that
there
is
both
conflict
preemption
and
express
preemption
here,
and
the
court
can
certainly,
as
it
did
in
boggs,
not
reach
the
question
of
express
preemption
and
go
off
on
conflict
preemption,
but--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--in
ridgeway
v.
ridgeway,
which
was
a
decision
of
this
court
involving
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
act,
the
court
noted
the
slayer
rule
and
determined
that
it
did
not
have
to
deal
with
it
in
the
context
of
that
case
and
that
it
was
an
extreme
example.
the
court
certainly
is
free
to
do
the
same
in
this
context
and
that,
i
believe,
was
also
an
express
preemption.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
oh,
indeed,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
i
believe
it's
at
footnote
8
on
page
20
of
petitioner's
brief.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
it's
also
described
in
amicus
briefs
for
the
national
coordinating
committee
and
in
the
western
conference
of
teamsters.
in
fact,
the
state
rules
vary
dramatically.
most
states
do
not
have
a
divorce
revocation
rule
at
all.
most
states,
more
than
two-thirds
of
the
states,
the
rule
is
simply
that
you
go
with
the
main
beneficiary.
it
is
in
a
handful
of
states
that
you
have
divorce
revocation
rules,
and
they
vary
among
themselves,
so
there
is
that
burden
that
plaintiffs
would
have
to
deal
with.
moreover,
the
opt-out
provision
that
you're
referring
to
in
this
state
law
merely
adds
another
layer
of
complexity.
now,
in
order
to
opt
out
you
have
to
meet
yet
another
state
standard,
so
at
the
end
of
the
day--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--well,
which
is
that
you
have
to
specifically
opt
out,
and
you
have
to
opt
out
in
the
manner
in
which
the
state
tells
you
you
have
to
opt
out.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
that's
correct.
i'm
talking
about
the
common
law
of
trusts,
federal
common
law,
which
in
prior
decisions
of
this
court
has
been
understood
to
apply
to
erisa
but,
more
importantly,
or
as
importantly--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--i'm
afraid
not,
justice
scalia.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
i
was
moving
on
from
justice
ginsburg's
question
to
distinguish
between
federal
common
law
which
is
incorporated
into
a
statute,
because
it
is
the
common
law
against
which
the
congress
legislates,
which
is
what
i
would
be
referring
to
with
regard
to
the
slayer
rule,
and
that
would
be
the
common
law
in
extant
in
1974
that
had
been
applied
in
other
federal
cases
to
other
federal
death
benefit
statutes.
there
is
also
a
notion
that
if
a
statute
does
not
answer
a
question,
if
there
are
interstices
that
the
court...
a
court
may
apply
a
federal
common
law
rule,
but
that's
not
the
case
here.
here,
erisa
speaks
specifically
to
the
issue
at
hand,
and
i
believe--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--it
looked...
it
would
be
the
plan
administrator's
choice.
it
would
not
be
a
decision
under
state
law,
and
the
plan
administrator
would
look
to
see
if
there
were
any
guidance
in
the
plan,
in
federal
common
law,
and
then
the
plan--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
--he...
no.
he
may...
in
making
a
decision
he
may,
of
course,
look
to
state
law
if
he
chooses.
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
i
believe
we
can
apply...
the
court
can
apply
the
same
analysis
for
both
of
them
with
one
exception.
one
of
our
arguments
is
that
there
is
a
conflict
with
erisa's
antialienation
provision.
that
provision,
which
is
found
in
section
206
of
the
statute,
applies
only
to
pension
plans,
but
all
of
our
other
arguments
would
apply
to
both
welfare
and
pension
plans.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder--
mr.
william
j.
kilberg
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
a
few
points.
the
last
point
that
mr.
goldstein
made,
which
suggests
broader
preemption
than
i
think
the
statute
entails,
erisa
preempts
state
law
only
insofar
as
it
relates
to
an
employee
benefit
plan.
no
one
is
suggesting
that
the
state
statute
is
preempted
with
regard
to
other
nonprobate
assets.
mr.
goldstein
also
mentioned
that
they
had
sued,
the
respondents
here
had
sued
petitioner,
not
the
plan.
well,
that
is
true.
that,
of
course,
was
true
in
boggs
as
well
and,
as
the
court
said
in
the
boggs
decision,
there,
as
here,
the
premise
of
the
lawsuit
is
based
on
a
displacement
of
erisa
provisions
and
plan
provisions.
a
point
with
regard
to
the
contingent
beneficiary
notion.
if
mr.
goldstein
is
correct,
and
respondents
are
beneficiaries
under
erisa
because
they
have
a
contingent
right,
then
their
only
cause
of
action
would
be
under
section
502(a)
of
erisa.
that
would
be
their
exclusive
right,
and
they
would
have
had
to
sue
the
plan
under
those
provisions
rather
than
the
petitioner
under
the
state
statute.
with
regard
to
the
qdro
point,
qualified
domestic
relations
order
point,
the
fact
is
that
a
qdro
could
have
been
fashioned
that
provided
that
the
spouse
had
given
up
any
interest
that
she
might
have
as
a
beneficiary.
the
fact
here
is,
that
wasn't
done.
that
provision
is
a
relatively
easy
one
to
effect.
it
wasn't
done,
and
that's
the
reason
that
respondents
must
lose.
unless
the
court
has
any
questions
for
me--
