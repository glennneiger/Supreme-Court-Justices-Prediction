justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
just...
is
your
point
that
it
was
the
law
before
erisa
was
passed,
or
that
it's
part
of
the
common
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
which
is
true?
in
other
words,
supposing
this
statute
had
been
passed
before
erisa.
would
that
make
a
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
point
is
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--your
point
is,
the
other
was
a
common
law
rule,
not
the
timing.
the
timing
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
you've
said
that
if
there
had
been
a
statute
which
is
in
effect
that
wouldn't
have
done
the
trick.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
of
course,
that's
the
question
in
the
case,
whether
it
does.
but
suppose
there's
an
ambiguity
in
the
designation,
that
there's
a
state
rule
of
law
that
would
resolve,
would
the
trust
look
to
the
state
rule
of
law
or
would
it
look
to
some
federal
common
law
rule
about
ambiguities.
for
example,
say
the
beneficiary
named
my
son
joseph,
and
it
turns
out
that
the...
that
he
has...
he
gave
the
middle
name
joseph
to
four
different
sons,
and
how
would
you
go
about
resolving
that?
would
you
look
to
a
state
rule
or
a
federal
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
would
confine
his
inquiry
entirely
to
the
terms
of
the
plan
itself?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
two
questions?
first,
do
you
agree
that
the
state
law
here
is
a
law
of
general
applicability?
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
second
question
is,
in
weighing
the
various
interests
at
stake
here,
should
we
give
any
weight
at
all
to
the
interests
in
carrying
out
the
wishes
of
the
former
employee
who...
whose
assets
are
being
distributed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
shouldn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
we
know
he
presumably
was
advised
by
a
lawyer,
who
was
a
state
lawyer
who
told
him
what
the
state
rule
of
law
was,
and
presumably
he
was
told
he
could
rely
on
the
fact
that
he
didn't
have
to
change
his
designation
for
his
sons
to
get
the
property.
isn't
that
the
normal
thing
you
would
expect
a
divorce
lawyer
in
that
state
to
tell
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
unless
as
a
matter
of
law,
there
is
a
rule
of
law
that
automatically
changed
the...
such
as
the
slayer
rule.
don't
you
think
there's
a
reasonable
probability
here
that
the
plan
participant
thought
the
money
would
not
go
to
his
divorced
wife?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
normally
in
the
divorce
settlement...
they
did
have
a
divorce
settlement...
don't
they
provide
otherwise?
if
there's
a
specific
intent
to
save
that
particular
asset
for
the
divorced
wife,
isn't
that
normally
set
forth
in
the
agreement
providing
for
the
property
settlement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
basic...
you
think
he
really
wanted
the
money
to
go
to
his
divorced
wife.
that's
your
suggestion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
view
of
the
murder
situation
statutes
are
all
preempted,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
despite
the
express
preemption
provisions
on
which
you
rely
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--can--
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
refresh
my
recollection?
does
the
statute
take
care
of
the
situation
when
the
beneficiary
is
incompetent,
or
a
child,
or
something
like
that?
does
it
provide
paying
to
a
conservator,
or
is
that
done
as
a
matter
of
state
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
contemplate
that.
so
if,
in
fact,
the
plan
administrator
knows
that
the...
say,
the
beneficiary
is
in
prison,
or
is
having
a
mental
problem
or
something,
he
doesn't
have
to
pay
out
right
away?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
