even
in
the
face
of
a
provision
in
erisa
that
says
benefits
have
to
be

mr.
kilberg,
the
washington
supreme
court
seems
to
have
analyzed
the
decedent's
life
insurance
policy
separately
from
the
pension
plan
in
doing
the
preemption
analysis.
do
we
have
to
consider
those
two
plans
separately,
or
do
we
apply
the
same
analysis
to
both
of
them?

why
couldn't
that--
justice

--be
a
qdro,
though?
in
the
example

--kennedy
gave
you,
why
isn't
that
covered
by
the
qdro
section--
justice

--if
it
comes
up
in

--this
isn't
part
of

apparently.

and
it's
not
a
brief
of
yours,
and
by
what
authority
did
you
file
it,
if
i
may
ask?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
normally
things
that
the
parties
intend
to
refer
to
are
incorporated
in
a
joint
appendix,
and
i
did
not
know
that
we
accepted
these
independently
submitted
supplemental
documents.
i
couldn't
believe
it
when
it
came
in.
