mr.
kilberg--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
may
not
know
which
state
is
the
state
that
will
govern.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
before
we
get
into
that,
i'm
still
a
little
confused
on
the
nature
of
the
common
law
that
we're
talking
about.
as
i
understand
you,
mr.
kilberg,
you
are
not
talking
about
the
common
law
of
california
or
massachusetts
or
anything.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
talking...
and
you're
not
talking
about
the
pre-erie
general
common
law,
either.
you're
talking
about
what
judge
friendly
called,
in
praise
of
erie
and
the
new
federal
common
law.
that
is,
federal
common
law
that
fills
in
the
interstices
of
federal
statute,
so
you
would
not
be
incorporating
any
particular
state's
slayer
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
would
be
a
federal,
a
true
federal
common
law
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
with
all
federal
statutes,
or
most
federal
statutes,
there
will
be
a
penumbral
area,
and
what
would
fill
that
in
would
not
be
the
law
of
any
particular...
common
law
of
any
particular
state,
but
federal
common
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
mcdowell,
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
your
prior
concession,
or
maybe
i
shouldn't
use
the
word
concession,
but
is
it
not
within
the
realm
of
the
possible
that
a
man
who
has
just
divorced
a
woman,
he's
tired
of
her,
he's
used
her
up,
he's
thrown
her
over,
he's
off
with
a
young
thing
but
not
married,
and
he's
feeling
tremendous
remorse,
so
he
says,
i'm
going
to
leave
that
pension
plan
alone.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
before
you
do
that,
can
you
just
clarify...
you
said
that
this
is
a
galloping
thing
in
the
states.
how
many
states
have
these
statutes
now?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
majority
of
states
still
do
not.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
not
married.
i
mean,
do
they
put
down
never
married
so
you
know
that?
you
said
they
must
put
down
divorced.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
will
say...
it
will
say
either
married
or
divorced.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
goldstein,
you
said
the
washington
statute,
but
there
are
a
number
of
statutes,
and
they
are
various,
so
it
wouldn't
obviate
the
conflicts
problem.
