justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
washington.
while
david
egelhoff
was
married
to
petitioner,
he
designated
her
as
the
beneficiary
of
a
life
insurance
policy
and
pension
plan
provided
by
his
employer
and
governed
by
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act
of
1974
(erisa).
soon
after
petitioner
and
mr.
egelhoff
divorced,
mr.
egelhoff
died
intestate.
respondents
mr.
egelhoff’s
children
by
previous
marriage,
sued
petitioner
in
state
court
to
recover
the
insurance
and
pension
benefits,
they’ve
relied
on
a
washington
statute
providing
that
the
designation
of
a
spouse
as
the
beneficiary
of
a
nonprobate
asset,
and
here
such
as
a
life
insurance
policy
or
pension
policy
is
revoked
automatically
upon
divorce.
respondents
argued
that
in
the
absence
of
a
qualified
name
beneficiary
the
proceeds
would
pass
to
them
as
mr.
egelhoff
heirs.
the
trial
courts
concluded
that
the
plans
should
be
interpreted
in
accordance
with
erisa,
and
granted
summary
judgment
to
petitioner.
the
washington
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
the
statute
was
not
preempted
by
erisa.
the
washington
supreme
court
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse.
erisa’s
preemption
section
states
that
erisa
“shall
supersede
any
and
all
state
laws
insofar
as
they
may
now
or
hereafter
relate
to
any
employee
benefit
plan”.
a
state
law
relates
to
an
erisa
plan
we
have
said,
“if
it
has
a
connection
with
or
reference
to
such
a
plan”.
the
statute
at
issue
here
has
an
impermissible
connection
with
erisa
plans
because
it
binds
administrators
to
a
particular
choice
of
rules
for
determining
beneficiary
status.
administrators
must
pay
benefits
to
the
beneficiaries
chosen
by
the
state
law,
rather
than
to
those
identified
in
plan
documents.
this
implicates
an
area
of
core
erisa
concern
contradicting
erisa’s
commands
that
the
plan
shall
“specify
the
bases
on
which
payments
are
made,”
and
that
the
fiduciary
shall
administer
the
plan
“in
accordance
with
the
documents
and
instruments
governing
the
plan.”
the
statue
also
has
a
prohibited
connection
with
erisa
plans
because
it
interferes
with
nationally
uniform
plan
administration.
administrators
cannot
make
payments
simply
by
identifying
the
beneficiary
specified
in
the
plan
documents.
instead
they
must
familiarize
themselves
with
state
statutes
determine
whether
the
named
beneficiary
status
has
been
“revoked”.
differing
state
regulations
affecting
an
erisa
plan
system
for
processing
claims
and
paying
benefits
impose
precisely
the
burden
erisa
preemption
was
intended
to
avoid.

in

stevens
