we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
99-1529,
donna
rae
egelhoff
v.
samantha
egelhoff.
mr.
kilberg.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
a
common
law
rule,
we're
dealing
with
a
country
with
50
different
states.
i
mean,
don't
you
think
the
law
might
have
been
different
in
some
of
those
states?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
mechanics
of
the
working
of
a
plan?
supposing
that
you
have
a
designated
beneficiary,
and
the
insurance
company
or
whoever
goes
and
pays...
goes
on
and
pays
out
to
the
beneficiary.
in
fact,
the
beneficiary
killed
someone
and
he's
disqualified
from
inheriting.
if
he's
still
the
named
beneficiary,
is
the
insurance
company
responsible
for
that
sort
of
an
error?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
he
have
to
look
into
a
whole
bunch
of
factual
matters
like,
you
know,
whether
this
beneficiary
might
be
disqualified
by
some
state,
state
statute
like
the
slayer's--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it
seems
to
me
that
would
be
a
much
narrower
ground
for
ruling
in
your
favor
here,
rather
than
these
general
assertions
about
the
incorporation
in
the
common
law,
that
perhaps
if
a
state
statute
actually
directly
affects
the
designation
of
a
beneficiary,
the
way
the
washington
statute
does,
it
may
be
different
than
the
slayer
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
kilberg.
ms.
mcdowell,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
suppose,
ms.
mcdowell,
you
have
a
trustee
under
an
erisa
plan
who
has
a
designated
beneficiary
and
so
forth
and
perhaps,
you
know,
ambiguity
as
suggested
by
justice...
something
else...
and
then
you
have
simply
a
trust
company
that
has
exactly
the
same
provisions
but
it's
not
an
erisa
plan.
are...
does...
are
their
duties
different?
say
when
you
come
to
an
ambiguity...
you're
both
sitting
in
seattle.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so...
but
would
the
federal
common
law
likely
be
different
from
the
state
of
washington's
law,
or
is
it
just
up
for
grabs,
kind
of?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
mcdowell.
mr.
goldstein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
fact
that
the
clerk's
office
gives
you
leave
to
file
it
doesn't
mean
that
it's
a
desirable
or
even
a
permissible
thing
to
do
so
far
as
the
court
is
concerned.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
these
are
part
of
the
record?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
we
find
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
goldstein.
mr.
kilberg,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kilberg.
the
case
is
submitted.
