mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
will
turn
quickly
to
the
mistaken
notion
that
the
washington
statute
at
issue
in
this
case
conflicts
with
erisa,
but
i
want
to
explain
from
the
outset
exactly
what
this
statute
does
and
why
it
does
it.
washington,
like
a
number
of
states,
as
a
number
of
the
questions
have
reflected,
recognizes
the
unsurprising
proposition
and,
justice
scalia,
it
is
recognized
by
an
increasing
number
of
states
very
rapidly,
that
when
two
people
divorce
they
try
to
give
each
other
less
money,
not
more.
particularly
relevant
here,
the
designation
of
one
spouse
as
a
death
beneficiary,
whether
in
a
will,
and
there
are
will
statutes
in
49
out
of
the
50
states,
or
in
some
other
asset,
is
premised
on
the
idea
that
at
the
time
of
death
the
couple
will
still
be
married.
applied
to
this
case,
and
i
think
it
very
important
that
we
talk
about
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
statute
rests
on
the
idea
that
when
petitioner
sought
and
received
a
divorce
from
david
egelhoff,
and
after
they
entered
a
very
detailed
divorce
decree,
to
the
level
of,
he
got
the
tan
area
rug
and
she
got
the
exercycle,
that
he
did
not
walk
out
of
the
courthouse
thinking,
oh,
and
i
want
her
to
get
the
pension
and
the
life
insurance,
too.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--fortunately--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--with
respect,
we
can
here
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
divorce
decree
itself
explicitly
says
that
he
gets
the
pension.
it
says
so,
and
there's
no
doubt
that
that
was
the
parties'
intent.
and
second,
there
is
a
declaration
uncontradicted
in
the
record
that
she
basically
went
around
telling
people
that
david
would
roll
over
in
his
grave
at
the
notion
that
she
was
going
to
get
this
money.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
with
respect,
in
terms
of
just
what
the
parties
understood
would
happen
to
the
money,
and
in
particular,
justice
scalia,
what
donna's
expectation
was,
he
got
the
pension
benefits.
the
death
benefit
is
the
entirety
of
the
pension
benefit,
and
she
could
not
have
an
expectation
that
she
would
ever
get
the
money,
because
she
knows
that
he
could
change
it
the
next
day.
moreover,
this
is
a
community
property
state.
they
had
to
divide
up
the
marital
property,
which
included
the
value
of
the
pension
at
the
time
of
divorce,
and
she
had
to
get
equivalent
assets
at
the
time
of
divorce.
this
is
nothing
more
than
a
double
recovery
in
the
purest
sense.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
is
relevant
in
the
sense...
in
two
senses,
justice
souter.
the
first
is
that
i'm
trying
to
explain
to
you
the
rationale
and
why
it
is
so
rational
that
washington
did
what
it
did,
and
second,
it
goes
to
the
question
now
speaking
to
the
statute,
what
the
standard
is
for
finding
a
conflict
and
finding
preemption,
and
that
is
that
in
this
area,
from
cases
like
hisquidero
on,
there
must
be
a
clear
and
manifest
conflict.
and
now
let
me
turn
directly
to
the
notion
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
conflict.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
there
are
20
states
that
have
the
statute
now...
the
number
has
been
growing
rapidly...
with
respect
to
nonprobate
assets.
it
was--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--they
do
not.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
exactly.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
they
do
not--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--they
do
not
all
say
that,
but
almost
all
do,
because
that's
in
the
upc.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
the
majority
do.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
breyer
has
helpfully
just
identified
three
different
opt-out
provisions
that
go
directly
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there's
an
actual
burden
on
the
plan.
chief
justice
rehnquist--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the
courts--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it
is
a
principal
criterion.
whether
or
not
there's
an--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--we
do
not
believe
so,
and
boggs
is
an
example,
that
the
court
did
not
reach
the
question.
four
justices
of
the
court
in
justice
breyer's
opinion
explained
that
there
really
wasn't
a
burden
and
there
wasn't
field
preemption.
the
majority
said
there
is
conflict
preemption
here,
but
it
is
worth
noting
that
justice
kennedy's
opinion
in
that
case
did
explain
why
there
would
be
real
administrative
trouble
if
you
recognized
nonparticipant
interest.
chief
justice
rehnquist...
so
if
i
could
continue
for
the
moment
to
focus
on
the
practicalities
of
what
happens
to
an
erisa
plan,
turn
to
the
specific
alleged
conflicts
with
the
statute
in
just
a
moment.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
you
asked
how
this
worked
in
operation,
and
i'd
like
to
refer
to
you...
refer
you
to
the
respondent's
lodging
for
a
moment.
respondent's
lodging
at
tab
3
has
the
designation
form
for
the
life
insurance
plan,
and
it
explains
that
david
egelhoff
designated
donna
r.
egelhoff,
wife...
i
apologize.
there
may
be
some
confusion.
this
is
an
8-1/2
x
11
lodging
that
may
not
have
come
upstairs.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i'm
starting
at
tab
3,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
we
conferred
with
the
clerk's
office
and
received
permission
to
file
a
lodging.
let
me
explain
also
that
these
are
materials...
it's
particularly
important,
because
this
is
not
something
that
translates
at
all
well
into--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that
point
is
well-taken,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
just
specify
for
the
benefit
of
the
court
that
the
documents
that
i
am
about
to
refer
to
are
part
of
the
record.
i
understand
the
point
is
well-taken
that
counsel
are
much
preferred
at
the
beginning
of
the
case
within
the
joint
appendix
to
have
one
consolidated
document.
it
is
the
case,
however,
that
as
the
case
moves
along,
for
example,
after
we
received
the
petitioner's
brief,
other
documents
become
relevant
that
we
want
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
so
let
me
just
be
absolutely
clear
these
are
not
pedagogical
devices,
anything
outside
the
record.
the
two
documents
i'm
going
to
take
you
now
are
in
the
record
of
the
case.
tab
3
is
the
designation
form,
and
it
says
that
david
designated
donna
r.
egelhoff,
wife.
the
reason
i
point
to
it
is
that
when
the
administrator
receives
a
claim
for
death
benefits
it's
common
ground
that
he
or
she
pulls
out
the
designation
form.
before
paying
the
benefits,
he
or
she
must
get
the
death
certificate.
we
have
to
be
sure
that
the
person
is
dead.
that's
common
sense.
on
the
death
certificate
it
explains
that
david
egelhoff
died,
and
on
line
14...
or,
excuse
me,
in
cell
14,
three
lines
down,
it
explains
that
he
was
divorced,
and
that
is
the
sum
total
of
the
administrative
burden
that
is
put
on
erisa
plan
administrators.
they
look
at
the
exact
same
documents.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
so
far...
i
will
not
represent
to
the
court
that
i
have
been
able
to
identify
every
state,
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
one
that
hasn't.
there
was
no
easy
way
of
identifying
every
state's
death
certificate,
but
yes,
because
they
have
to
notify
next-of-kin,
and
remember
as
well,
justice
scalia,
that
when
you
try
to
pay
on
death
the
survivor
annuity
required
by
erisa
you
must
make
the
same
inquiry.
you
have
to
know
if
the
participant
was
married
at
the
time
of
death,
and
so--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the
question
for
the
survivor
annuity,
justice
ginsburg,
is,
at
the
time
of
death
was
the
person
married.
that...
and
if
so,
there
must
be
a
mandatory--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--exactly.
there
are
two
lines
in
the
death
certificate.
one
is
married
or
divorced
and
the
second
is,
there
is,
in
fact,
a
surviving
spouse,
so--
now,
a
number
of
the
questions
have
focused
on
whether
or
not
there
is
a
conflict
with
the
terms
of
erisa.
justice
scalia,
you
pointed
out
that
it
may
well
be
that
there
would
be
preemption
even
if
there
was
no
additional
burden.
this
is...
congress
said,
this
is
how
it's
going
to
work.
washington
can't
say
anything
different.
justice
souter,
earlier
you
inquired
similarly
whether
or
not
there
might
not
be
conflict
preemption,
because
the
statute
mandates
that
you
have
to
pay
the
benefits
to
the
named
beneficiary.
the
difficulty
is
that
the
statute
does
not
say
that.
the
only
claimed
conflict
here
is
with
the
term,
beneficiary,
and
with
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that
occurs,
with
all
due
respect
to
my
colleagues,
because
in
their
briefs
there
is
an
ellipsis
of
an
important
phrase,
and
the
definition
of
a
beneficiary
is...
and
i'm
going
to
now
refer
to
29
u.s.c.
1002
sub
(8).
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
at
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief
at
page
2,
and
i...
when
i
refer
to
statutory
section,
from
henceforth
it
will
always
be
in
that
brief.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes,
justice
scalia.
this
is
1002,
sub
(8).
the
term,
beneficiary,
means
a
person
designated
by
a
participant
or
by
the
terms
of
an
employee
benefit
plan
who
is
or
may
become
entitled
to
a
benefit
thereunder,
and
let
me
explain
how
washington
law
operates
here.
washington
law
at
the
time
of
divorce
does
not
say,
if
you
divorce
you
are
no
longer
a
beneficiary,
the
money
instead
goes
to
the
children.
it
instead
says
that
the
designation
is
ineffective
and
it
is
up
to
the
terms
of
the
plan
to
determine
who
gets
the
money,
and
that's
exactly
what
the
children
were
here.
they
were
persons
who
may
become
entitled
to
a
benefit
thereunder.
they
have
always
been,
because
the
plan
specified.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
understand.
i
have
both
points
firmly
in
mind.
the
first,
washington
law
does
not
say
that
the
children
become
entitled
because
of
the
statute.
all
that
washington
law
says
is
that
the
designation...
it
reflects,
again,
the
common-sense
understanding
that
the
meaning
of
the
designation...
i
mean,
it's
fairly
obvious
here,
when
it
says
donna
r.
egelhoff,
wife,
but--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--becomes
disentitled,
and
then--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
justice
souter.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no.
the
actual
conflict,
to
make
it
even
more
specific,
the
conflict
would
have
to
go,
if
petitioner's
position
were
accepted,
erisa
says,
pay
the
beneficiary,
which
is
correct,
absent
this
special--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
then
we
come
to
your
second
point,
because
we
have,
or
may
become,
because
it
doesn't
say
the
person
who
is
entitled
to
receive
by
that...
under
the
designation
or
under
the
plan.
it's,
who
may
become.
i
agree
with
you
that
that
is
intended
to
trigger
contingent
beneficiaries.
our
point
is
that
the
children
are
as
much
contingent
beneficiaries
in
the
meaning
of
that
term
as
is
the
participant,
because--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
we
are
looking--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
will
give
you
an
interpretive
aid
in
trying
to
decide
what
it
means
to
be,
or
may
become,
and
that
is
that
it
can't
be
the
case
that
the
children...
let
me
take
you
to
boggs.
justice
kennedy's
opinion
for
the
court
in
boggs
explained
that
there
are
a
class
of
people
that
erisa
is
intended
to
protect,
participants
and
beneficiaries.
our
position
is,
is
that
before
the
death
of
david,
and
before
the
administrator
looked
at
the
alternate
beneficiary
provisions,
the
children
were
protected
by
erisa.
they
were
in
the
class
of
people
who
could
bring
an
action
and
say,
look,
you're
misadministering
plan
assets,
just
as
much
as
donna
could.
they
are
within
the
class
of
people
that
erisa
intended
to
protect,
and
so
if
you
are
going
to
call
them
not
beneficiaries,
they
are
excluded
from
the
rest
of
the
statute
entirely
and
they
receive
none
of
the
protections.
our
understanding
is
that
if
congress
wanted
to
say...
use
more
limited
language
than
or
may
become,
it
could
have.
it
could
have
said--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
but
the
first
class,
the
group
of
people
who
are
protected
by
the
statute,
are
denominated
in
the
statute
as
beneficiaries.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
justice
scalia,
there
are
many
times
when
an
erisa
plan
pays
benefits
to
someone
other
than
a
named
beneficiary,
so
we're
going
to
have
to
find
the
conflict
somewhere
else.
erisa
plans
pay
benefits
out
under
the
spousal
annuity.
erisa
plans
pay
erisa
benefits
out
under
the
qdro
provisions.
it
is
many
times
not
the
case
that
they
pay
it
out
directly
to
the
person
whose
name
is
on
it.
in
fact,
the
plan
here
reserves
the
right
to
determine
that
the
individual
named
is
incompetent,
and
not
to
pay
them
then,
either.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
let
me
deal
with
what
i
take
to
be
the
premise
of
your
point,
which
is
that
a
conflict
with
the
terms
of
the
plan
would
be
sufficient
to
cause
preemption,
if
the
plan
said,
you
can't
do
this,
and
second...
so
i'll
return
to
that
in
just
a
moment,
whether
or
not
that
would
be
sufficient
to
cause
erisa
preemption,
but
let
me
deal
with
it
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
it
is
important
to
return
to
the
text
of
the
statute
again.
with
the
stroke
of
a
pen,
you
can
write
into
any
nonprobate
asset,
including
an
erisa
plan,
divorce
revocation
statutes
do
not
apply.
justice
ginsburg,
you
asked
the
petitioner's
lawyer,
wouldn't
there
also
be
the
problem
you
wouldn't
know
which
state
law
applies.
the
attorney
general
of
washington
in
her
brief
at
footnote
6
has
explained
under
this
statute,
you
don't
have
to
say,
revised
code
1107010
doesn't
apply,
alabama
code,
da-da-da.
it
is,
you
just
say,
divorce
revocation
statutes
don't
apply.
an
earlier
question
also
said,
and--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
ginsburg,
it
would
in
one
sense
and
potentially
not
in
another.
the
court
is
asked
to
pass
on
a
particular
statute
with
three
safe
harbors
that
justice
breyer
has
identified.
i'm
not
representing
to
you
that
the
same
rationale
would
save
all
of
them.
i
think,
though,
your
point
goes
more
particularly
to
what
does
the
administrator
do
in
a
conflict
of
laws
problem?
there's
the
hypothetical,
for
example,
that
someone's
from
oregon,
someone
from
washington,
someone
from
texas.
the
plan
operates
in
a
multi-state
arena.
there
are
two
important
points.
the
first
is
that
there
is
the
safe
harbor
both
under
the
text
of
erisa
and
under
this
plan...
under
this
statute,
that
says,
if
you
have
any
doubt,
don't
pay.
you
don't
have
to
go
to
court.
just
don't
do
it.
just
send
a
letter
to
the
people
who
want
the
money
and
say
to
them,
come
back
to
us
when
you
have
figured
it
out
or
a
court
has
told
you
what
to
do.
and
so
in
terms
of
getting
to
the
practicalities,
justice
ginsburg,
of
how
is
this
going
to
work
for
administrators--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
scalia,
it
is
frequently
the
case,
in
fact,
that
erisa
plans
have
some
doubt.
the
court
discussed
probably
the
most
obvious
cases,
slayer
statutes,
simultaneous
death
happens
actually
not
infrequently,
but
there
are
lots
of
times...
justice
stevens,
the
middle
name
of
all
the
children
is
joseph.
there
are
many
times
when
you
don't
pay
immediately.
erisa
provides
in
its
enforcement
section,
and
the
circuits
uniformly
agree,
that
what
the
plan
should
do
there
is
simply
put
the
money
aside
and
wait
for
the
claiming
participants
to
fight
it
out.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
does...
erisa
does
not.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
there
are
many
times
this
happens.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
those--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
and
it
is
important
to
understand
in
terms
of
what
the
court
is
opening
the
doors
to,
that
the
states
have
been
regulating
this
area
for
centuries,
and
that
is
the...
you
know,
this
is
in
the
area
of
divorce.
there
are
normal
probate
areas
that
they
have
limited
themselves,
and
if
i
could
just
mention
one
point--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
understand.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that's
exactly
right,
because
that's
a
prohibited
alienation.
that's
boggs,
and
let
me
explain
why
this
is
not.
congress
provided
that
there
are
certain
people,
participants
and
their
beneficiaries,
when
it's
a
spousal
annuity,
who
have
an
expectation
that
they
are
going
to
live
off
pension
benefits,
and
it
specified
when
an
alienation
would
occur.
this
is
not
a
situation
where
the
money
is
taken
away
from
the
participant
or
anyone
else
who
has
a
mandated
right
to
it
and
give...
and
let
me
take
you
to
the
definition.
the
alienation
definition
is
not
reprinted
in
the
appendix
to
any
brief...
i
apologize...
but
i
will
simply
read
it
to
you.
well,
the
statute
is,
and
that
is
at
the
appendix
to
petitioner's
brief
at
page
4,
and
it
simply
says,
not
very
helpfully,
each
pension
plan
shall
provide
the
benefits
provided
under
the
plan
may
not
be
assigned
or
alienated.
justice
kennedy's
opinion
in
boggs
looks
to
the
irs's
definition
and
i
will
read
it
to
you.
this
for
the
record
is
at
26
c.f.r.
section
1.401a-(13)(c)(i)...
(ii).
the
terms,
assignment
and
alienation,
include
any
direct
or
indirect
arrangement,
whether
revocable
or
irrevocable
whereby
a
party
acquires
from
a
participant
or
beneficiary
a
right
or
interest
enforceable
against
a
plan
in
or
to
any
or
all
of
the
plan
benefit
payment.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
we
agree.
it's
not
an
alienation.
that's
our
point,
and
that's
the
difference
from
the
hypothetical
you
asked.
if
there
was
a
divorce
decree
that
said,
look...
if
the
divorce
decree
here
said,
donna
egelhoff
is
going
to
get
100
percent
of
david's
pension,
if
that
is
not,
justice
o'connor,
registered
as
a
qdro
that's
an
alienation.
you
can't
do
it.
now,
the
petitioner--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--because
it
takes
it
from
david
and
gives
it
to
donna.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
apologize,
justice
scalia.
i
was
focusing
on
the
take
it
from
the
person
to
another.
you
were
focusing
on
the
operation
of
law.
i
actually
agree
with
your
interpretation
of
operation
of
law.
unfortunately,
i
think
it's
precluded
by
boggs.
that
was
state
community
property
law.
i
think
justice
breyer
might...
some
might
think
he
had
the
better
of
that
argument.
that
is
water
under
the
bridge,
and
that
was
community
property
law.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
remember,
the
second
wife,
community
property
law,
took
it.
she...
the
community
property
law
is
what
gave
it
to
her.
so
what
i'm
focusing
on,
though,
is
that
this
does
not
take
it
from
somebody
and
give
it
to
somebody
else.
now,
there
was
the
question
put
before,
well,
should
this
have
been
a
qdro,
and
there
is
the
negative
inference
suggested
by
petitioner
that
congress
occupied
this
field,
that
really
these
sorts
of
things
are
supposed
to
be
done
by
qdro's,
and
i
will
explain
to
you
why
that's
not
so.
washington
law
doesn't
intend
to
say
that
the
kids
will
get
the
money.
that's
the
whole
point,
that
the
plan
will
decide
who
gets
the
money.
washington
law
wants
david,
after
the
divorce,
to
decide
who
will
get
it.
say
there's
a
third
wife.
david...
say
he's
a
serial
marrier.
if
there's
a
third
wife,
david
wants
to
be
able
to
name
her.
if
there's
a
qdro,
he
can't.
if
the
divorce
decree
said,
the
money
goes
to
the
kids,
he's
out
of
luck.
that's
a
registered
decree
under
washington
state
law.
all
washington
is
trying
to
do
here
is
say,
look,
when
you
divorce,
the
intent
is
that
the
spouse,
your
ex-spouse
isn't
going
to
get
the
money.
go
fix
the
problem
some
other
way,
and
it
says
to
the
plans,
or
any
other
nonprobate
asset,
you
don't
want
to
comply,
say
you're
not
going
to
comply.
you
have
any
doubts,
don't
comply.
and
it
says
to
the
participant
himself,
if
you
don't
want
this
to
be
the
rule,
just
say
so,
either
in
the
divorce
decree
or
even
in
your
designation.
there
really
is
nothing
going
on
here
that
congress
didn't
want
to
happen.
there's
nobody...
unlike
boggs,
where
we
had
the
actual
spouse
who
was
going
to
get
the
spousal
annuity,
or
we
had
the
pension
benefits
after
death
in
the
hands
at
least
of
the
estate
of
the
pensioner,
none
of
that
applies
here.
we're
in
a
situation
where
congress
left
it
up
to
anybody
to
name
a
designee,
and
unless
there's
some
real
practical
problem
for
the
erisa
plan,
unless
something's...
it's
just
not
workable,
i
could
understand
a
reason
to
preempt
it.
but
when
you're
going
to
take
away
simultaneous
death,
slayer
statutes...
in
the
footnote
in
which
they
address
the
issue
in
their
reply
brief,
petitioner
says,
justice
scalia,
that
it
preempts
state
law
definitions
of
what
it
is
to
die,
who's
a
spouse,
what's
a
child,
common
law
issues
frequently
regulated
by
the
states.
i
should
make
one
final
point,
and
that
is
that
there
is
at
the
very
least
one
alternative
narrow
holding
that
i
don't
understand
the
answer
to
for
this
court,
and
that
is
that
we
sued
petitioner
under
a
provision
of
state
law
that
lets
us
just
sue
her,
and
if
the
problem
is
the
practical
administration
of
this
rule,
that
it
will
cause
a
burden
for
erisa
plans,
the
rule
at
the
least
ought
to
be
that
that's
not
preempted.
it's
a
state
law
conversion
suit.
we
can
go
after
her
for
the
money.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
two
points.
the
first
is
that,
of
course,
it
doesn't
operate
in
such
a
fashion
if
there's
any
contrary
expression
of
intent
by
any
of
the
parties,
be
it
the
plan
or
the
participant.
the
second
is
that
i
do
think
in
these
erisa
cases
we
get
the
unfortunate
sense
that
this
statute
is
about
erisa
plans,
and
it's
not.
there's
a
separate
statute,
of
course,
that
deals
with
every
form
of
will.
this
statute
deals
with
every
conceivable
form
of
nonprobate
asset.
it's
really
important
under
state
law.
most
of
the
money
that
is
held
by
individuals
now
is
either
in
your
home
or
in
a
life
insurance
plan
or
in
a
pension,
whether
qualified
or
not,
and
you
get
the
situation
that
you
have
here,
and
that
is
that
donna
egelhoff
already
got
equivalent
assets.
she's
going
to
come
along
and
recover
again.
the
children
are
going
to
be
completely
out
of
luck
for
no
sensible
purpose
at
all.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
