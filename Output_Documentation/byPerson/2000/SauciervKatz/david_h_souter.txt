justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
the
only
situation
in
which
the
two
increase
in
effect
will
be
exactly
the
same,
is
the
situation
in
which
the
general
standard
has,
by
course
of
judicial
decision,
been
reduced
down
to
a
kind
of
pinpoint
specific
rule
for
certain
cases,
e.g.,
hog-tie
cases.
and
in
the
case
in
which
immunity
is
claimed,
the
facts
in
that
case
are
precisely
duplicative
of
the
facts,
which
have
been
found
to
result
in
this
pinpoint
rule.
that's
the
only
i
case,
i
take
it
on
your
view,
in
which
the
two
increase
will,
in
effect,
reach
precisely
the
same
result
necessarily.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i'm
not
saying
that
there
is
a
requirement,
but
i'm
saying
that,
if
in
fact
the
previous
case
law
has
got
to
the
pinpoint
stage
and
the
facts
claimed
by
way
of
defense
precisely
fall
within
that
pinpoint,
then
the
two
increase
will
not
be
different,
but
that's
the
only
case
i
take
in
which
that
will
be
true
on
your
view.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
simply
means
i
think
that,
if
you
have
a
very
general...
if
your
fourth
amendment
standard
has
never
been
rendered
anything
but
general
in
formulation,
then
there
is
a
greater
possibility,
there
is
a
possibility
for
disagreement
about
the
application
of
that
standard
to
specific
fact
circumstances.
and
so
isn't
the
relationship
between
the
two
inquiries
this,
if
the
first
standard,
the
fourth
amendment
standard
has
never
been
stated
by
the
courts,
except
in
general
terms,
then
probably
there
will
be
room
for
some
reasonable
disagreement
about
its
application.
you're
saying
in
this
case
the
graham
and
connor
standard
is
at
a
pretty
high
level
of
generality
and
therefore
you
can
charge
a
jury
on
the
graham
and
connor
standard
and
they'll
decide
whether
in
their
judgment
the
officer's
conduct
was
or
was
not
reasonable.
but
they
will
also
have
a
second
question
and
that
is
to
say,
was
the
graham
and
connor
standard
so
clear
in
its
application
that
a
reasonable
officer
might
have
come
out
differently
from
the
way
you
did.
is
that
the
relationship
between
the
two?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
sure,
i'm
sure.
yes,
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you...
what's
the
additional
margin?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
does
the
verdict
say?
does
the
verdict
pass
on
qualified
immunity?
justice
david
h.
souter
including
qualified
immunity?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
jury
has
made
a
qualified
immunity
finding.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
so
the
jury
has
simply
determined
whether
there
is
or
is
not,
yes
or
no,
a
fourth
amendment
violation?
justice
david
h.
souter
comes
back
and
says,
yes
there
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
what
happens
next?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
that
what
he
was
asking
the
judge
to
do
is
to
determine,
based
on
prior
precedent,
whether
the
jury's
verdict
in
this
case
was
sufficiently
obvious
that
the
officer
should
have
known
that
the
jury
would
come
to
the
conclusion
it
came
to.
and
if
the
answer
is,
yes,
it
was
sufficiently
obvious,
this
is
right
within
the
zone
of
unreasonableness,
if
you
will,
that
prior
cases
have
established
then
there's
no
qualified
immunity.
but...
excuse
me,
i
didn't
think
this
went
to
a
jury.
no,
he's
giving
us
an
example
of
the
jury
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
am
suggesting
to
you
that
what
i
think
the
defense
is
asking
for
is
not
second
guessing
on
whether
the
jury
was
right
or
wrong
about
whether
in
its
judgment
there
was
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
but
whether
the
officers
should
have
anticipated,
on
the
basis
of
prior
precedent,
that
the
jury
would
come
out
the
way
it
did
and
if
the
officer
should
reasonably
have
anticipated
that,
then
there's
no
qualified
immunity.
if
the
officer
need
not
reasonably
have
anticipated
that,
then
there
is.
isn't
that
what
the
defense
is
asking
for?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
can
we
just
forget
for
a
minute,
ignore
the
question
whether
the
jury's
going
to
find
it
or
the
court's
going
to
find
it
and
just
get
down
to
what
the
standard
is,
whoever
is
going
to
find
it
must
follow.
and
forgetting
the
court/jury
dichotomy,
what
is
the,
in
your
judgment,
the
government
asking
for
that
it's
not
entitled?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
boyd,
i
think
you
answered
justice
scalia's
question
a
second
ago
and
i
wanted
to
come
back
to
it.
you
said
something
a
minute
ago
that
suggested
the
following
to
me.
you
were
saying,
i
think,
that
the
way
the
unreasonable
or
reasonable
excessive
force
test
has
been
articulated
in
graham
is
that
it
gives
the
officer
the
benefit
of
the
doubt,
you
know,
none
of
the
20/20
hindsight
and
so
on,
the
guy
in
the
field
and
all
of
that.
and
i
think
what
you're
arguing
is
that
qualified
immunity
gives
the
officer
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
it
says,
if
it
wasn't
clear
enough,
he
gets
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
and
i
think
what
you're
saying
is,
in
this
particular
case,
in
excessive
force
cases,
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
is
already
part
of
the
substantive
test.
so
it
makes
no
sense
to
say,
after
getting
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
on
the
substantive
standard,
you
then
get
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
again.
is
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
only
reasonable
mistakes
of
fact,
is
that
your
point?
