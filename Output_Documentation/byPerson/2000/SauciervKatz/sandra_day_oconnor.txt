justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let
me
ask,
in
the
context
of
this
very
case,
the
officer
sought
summary
judgment
on
the
qualified
immunity
issue.
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
before
it
had
ever
gone
to
trial,
to
a
jury?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
court
denied
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
in
this
case,
then
did
that
question
go
to
the
jury,
the
qualified
immunity
issue?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
just
tell
me,
what
went
to
the
jury?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
your
point
is...
excuse
me,
your
point
i
take
it
is
that
in
your
view
the
trial
judge
should
have
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
officer,
is
that
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
we
don't
get
beyond
all
these
other
things.
in
your
view
the
error
was
in
denying
summary
judgment
on
qualified
immunity?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now
was
there
a
factual
component
to
that
issue
that
makes
it
impossible
for
the
trial
judge
to
determine
or
could
there
be?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
mind
walking
us
through
how
you
think
this
court
should
resolve
this
case?
i
just
still
don't
understand.
we
have
these
issues
here,
would
you
walk
us
through
what
you
think
we
should
do
in
light
of
this
record
and
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
should
we
do
here?
you
were
going
to
walk
us
through.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there's
a
videotape
here
of
what
happened,
is
there
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
want
us
to
look
at
the
videotape?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
we
look
at
the
videotape
and
think
that
is
not
excessive
force?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you?
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
it
really
didn't
show
that
the
person
on
the
left
did
anything.
i
just
looked
at
it
repeatedly
and
i
came
away
thinking,
why
are
we
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
saw
no
force
by
the
man
on
the
left
insofar
as
the
van
was
concerned.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
i
thought
we
were
talking
about
this
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
see,
i
don't
understand
that
at
all.
i
thought
it
was
here
on
summary
judgment
and
they
take
the
view,
summary
judgment
should
have
been
given
for
the
officer.
i
thought
that's
where
we
were.
i
don't
see
why
the
jury
gets
into
this
at
all.
if
you
agree
with
them,
then
summary
judgment
was
wrongfully
denied
to
the
police
officer,
is
their
view,
i
think.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
excuse
me,
one
officer.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
you
told
us
we
could
look
at
the
videotape,
that
that
was
correct.
that
that
was
an
actual
depiction
of
what
happened.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
don't
we
assume
that,
as
a
fact.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
deciding
summary
judgment
on
the
qualified
immunity
issue
i
would
assume
we
would
assume
he
wasn't
resisting
and
then
go
ahead
and
resolve
the
issue.
