justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
clement,
in
those
situations
where
there
are
factual
controversies,
both
questions
will
have
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury,
won't
they?
i
mean
let's
say
in
the
present
case,
if
there's
a
dispute
as
to
whether
more
force
was
used
than
was
necessary,
the
jury
would
have
to
determine
whether
more
force
was
used
than
was
necessary.
and
then
the
jury
would
also
be
asked,
if
that
is
the
case,
was
that
use
of
excessive
force
so
obvious?
would
it
have
been
so
obvious
to
a
reasonable
officer
that
this
officer
does
not
enjoy
the
qualified
immunity
that
our
cases
provide?
wouldn't
both
questions
have
to
go
the
jury?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see
what
you
mean.
you
really
don't
have
to
determine
the
question
of
whether
it
violated
the
fourth
amendment
so
long
as
you
determine
that,
even
it
did,
this
didn't
go
beyond
what
a
reasonable
officer
might
have
thought
was
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
you'd
have
to
say
that
you
think
there's
a
reasonable
question
whether
they
constitute
a
fourth
amendment
violation
in
this
case.
if
there
weren't
a
reasonable
question
whether
they
constituted
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
you
wouldn't
have
any
immunity
claim,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait,
additional...
i
mean
you're
describing
graham
as
though
it's
just
a
matrix.
you
just
put
it
down
and
it
gives
you
the
answer.
it
just
mentions
those
three
things
as
factors.
simply
because
there's
resistance
you
can't
whack
the
guy
over
the
head
with
a
sledgehammer.
there's
still
a
question
of
how
much
force
you
can
apply
and
there
will
always
be
an
issue
no
matter
how
much
he
was
resisting,
no
matter
how
violent
the
crime
was
whether
you
applied
too
much
force.
so
it
just
doesn't
give
you
a
straight
out
answer
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
gives
you
factors,
that's
all
it
gives
you.
it
doesn't
tell
you
what
cases
can
be
gotten
rid
of.
it
tells
you
what
factors
are
relevant,
which
is
very
useful,
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
it
gives
you
an
answer
automatically.
justice
antonin
scalia
me
too.
i
thought
that's
why
we
were
here.
i
didn't
know
we
were
going
to
resolve
it,
the
facts
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
do
about
the
hog-tie
example
that
the
government
came
forward
with?
you
have
a
court
of
appeals
decision
that
says
you
cannot
hog-tie
a
person
with
diminished
capacity.
if
the
person
didn't
have
diminished
capacity
it's
another
question,
we
don't
have
to
get
into
that.
and
then
this
is
a
police
officer
who
does
use
the
hog
tie
but
for
a
person
who
has
no
diminished
capacity.
now
i
would
read
it
to
be,
you
know,
an
open
question
whether
that
is
excessive
force
or
not.
and
suppose
that
it
is
finally
decided
that
that
is
excessive
force.
is
that
police
officer,
despite
the
fact
that
the
last
time
around
the
court
of
appeals
thought
it
was
close
enough,
it
was
unwilling
to
speak
to
the
question,
is
that
police
officer
going
to
be
held
liable?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
here
then.
i
don't
know
why...
you're
proposing
the
same
test
that
the
government
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
he
could
reasonably
believe
that
he
could
act
in
a
fashion,
which
has
later
been
found
to
be
unreasonable.
i
mean,
you
speak
as
though
the
line
between
reasonable
and
unreasonable
is
so
clear
that
nobody
runs
the
risk
of
making
a
foot
fault.
i
mean,
indeed,
sometimes
they
go
over
the
line
unintentionally
and
to
a
slight
enough
degree
that
the
doctrine
of
qualified
immunity
ought
to
afford
protection.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
anderson
doesn't
apply
with
respect
to
excessive
force
and
i
would
like
to
know
why
that
is
correct?
just
because
you
have
a
reasonable
test
for
excessive
force,
you
also
have
a
reasonableness
test
for
probable
cause.
would
a
reasonable
officer
have
believed
that
a
crime
was
in
progress,
for
example.
they're
both
reasonableness
tests
and
in
anderson
we
say
nonetheless
you
have
an
antecedent
question
of
whether
there's
qualified
immunity
even
though...
even
though
it
may
be
determined
by
the
jury
that
this
was
unreasonable,
nonetheless
an
officer
would
still
be
protected
if
the
law
was
not
that
clear
about
what
was
reasonable
and
he
can
be
allowed
to
go
a
little
bit
over
the
line.
why
is
excessive
force
any
different
from
probable
cause
in
this
regard?
and
that's
the
point
of
the
ninth
circuit:
anderson
doesn't
apply.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
that's
fine,
but
that
still
leaves
me
the
question
of
why
you
don't
get
the
same
if
you
consider
that
a
double
benefit?
why
is
that
double
benefit
not
conferred
in
the
anderson
type
case,
in
the
probable
cause
type
case?
it
is
either,
there
in
fact
was
no
crime
in
progress,
but
a
reasonable
officer
could
have
thought
that
there
was
a
crime
in
progress.
that's
the
probable
cause
test,
but
then
we
add
on
top
of
that
a
qualified
immunities
test.
now,
why
don't
you
decry
the
benefit
on
a
benefit
in
that
situation?
maybe
anderson's
wrong,
but
then
you
should
be
asking
us
to
overrule
anderson.
i
don't
see
any
difference
between
the
probable
cause
test
and
the
excessive
force
test.
would
a
reasonable
officer
have
thought
this
was
excessive
force?
would
a
reasonable
office
have
thought
that
there
was
a
crime
in
progress?
i
don't
see
any
double
counting
in
one
case
any
more
than
in
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
haven't.
graham
is
a
reasonableness
test.
that's
all
it
is
and
it
mentions
certain
factors
that
ought
to
be
taken
into
account
and
determining
reasonableness.
is
it
a
violent
felon?
is
he
resisting
and
so
forth?
but
it's
a
reasonableness
test
just
as
the
probable
cause
test
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
you
know,
without
graham
we
have
the
legacy
of
several
centuries
of
probable
cause
law,
which
gives
the
policeman
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
he
doesn't
have
to
be
correct
about
whether
there
are
exigent
circumstances
so
long
as
it
was
a
reasonable
judgment
on
his
part
and
yet
on
top
of
that
giving
him
the
benefit
of
doubt,
we
also
have
a
separate
immunity
doctrine.
i
don't
see
why
it's
any
different
for
excessive
force
even
though
he
thought...
even
though
the
force
was
in
fact
excessive,
we're
going
to
give
the
policeman
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
if
a
reasonable
policeman
would
not
have
thought
it
was
excessive.
that
already
gives
him
one
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
the
government
is
arguing
just
as
in
anderson
you
give
a
second
benefit
of
the
doubt
for
immunity
so
also
in
the
case.
i
don't
see
any
difference
between
the
two.
now
maybe
anderson
is
wrong,
but
that's
a
different
issue.
