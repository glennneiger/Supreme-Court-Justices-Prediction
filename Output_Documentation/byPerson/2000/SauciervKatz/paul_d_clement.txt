mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
qualified
immunity
has
an
important
role
to
play
in
fourth
amendment
unreasonable
force
cases
just
as
it
does
in
fourth
amendment
unreasonable
search
cases
and
in
other
constitutional
contexts.
the
decision
below
effectively
merged
the
qualified
immunity
and
fourth
amendment
tests
in
the
case
of
unreasonable
force
cases.
the
court
reasoned
that
because
both
tests
are
framed
in
terms
of
objective
reasonableness,
the
qualified
immunity
test
had
nothing
to
add
to
the
underlying
fourth
amendment
test.
this
court
rejected
a
virtually
indistinguishable
line
of
reasoning
in
anderson
against
creighton
and
with
good
reason.
the
fourth
amendment
and
qualified
immunity
tests
are
distinct
and
serve
different
purposes.
the
fourth
amendment
test
governs
primary
conduct.
it
looks
at
the
force
used
and
asks
whether
that
force
was
reasonable.
the
qualified
immunity
test
by
contrast
looks
at
the
preexisting
law
and
asks
whether
that
preexisting
law
would
have
put
a
reasonable
officer
on
notice
that
his
or
her
conduct
was
unlawful.
qualified
immunity
thus
recognizes
that
even
competent
officers
will
make
reasonable
mistakes
and
government
officials
should
not
be
held
personally
liable
when
they
make
reasonable
judgment
calls
just
because
their
judgment
turns
out
to
be
mistaken.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well
in
many
cases,
once
the
case
is...
the
issue
of
qualified
immunity
is
brought
before
the
judge,
the
judge
can
rule
on
whether
there's
a
qualified
immunity
protection
in
the
case
and
there'll
be
no
issue
that
needs
to
go
to
the
jury
in
that
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
in
some
cases,
the
judge
may
want
to
try
to
isolate
the
factual
issues
that
are
at
stake
in
the
qualified
immunity
context
and
just
have
the
jury
focusing
on
those
factual
situations.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well
that
may
actually
end
up
being
the
only
issue
that
jury
really
needs
to
focus
on.
if
i
could
give
you
an
example,
in
a
recent
tenth
circuit
case
called
cruz
against
city
of
laramie,
the
tenth
circuit
decided
that
the
use
of
a
hog-tie
restraint
was
unreasonable
when
used
with
an
individual
who
exhibited
signs
of
diminished
capacity.
in
that
same
opinion,
they
reserved
the
question
about
whether
that
restraint
was
unreasonable
when
used
on
an
individual
who
did
not
exhibit
signs
of
diminished
capacity.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
in
many
cases,
i
think
the
jury
will
not
really,
if
there's
no
liability...
i'm
sorry,
if
there's
no
issue
about
injunctive
relief,
it
may
just
be
a
situation
where
the
court
can
simply
decide
what
the
clearly-established
law
is
and
instruct
the
jury
on
that
clearly-established
law
and
then
the
jury
can
make
its
determination.
to
pick
up
the
example
from
the
tenth
circuit
case,
if
in
a
subsequent
decision,
the
tenth
circuit
extended
its
rule
and
applied
the
rule
to
all
individuals,
saying
the
hog-tie
restraint
is
never
reasonable,
i
think
because
the
court
had
previously
expressly
reserved
the
question
of
whether
the
hog-tie
restraint
was
reasonable
when
applied
to
an
individual
who
did
not
exhibit
signs
of
diminished
capacity.
in
that
case,
the
issue
for
the
jury
would
be
whether
or
not
the
individual
who
was
arrested
exhibited
signs
of
diminished
capacity
and
that
would
really
be
the
only
issue
the
jury
needed
to
decide
because
if
the
individual
had
exhibited
signs
of
diminished
capacity,
under
the
court's
prior
decision
in
cruz,
that...
that
conduct
would
be
not
only
unlawful
but
clearly
established.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
jury
decided
that
the
individual
had
not
exhibited
signs
of
diminished
capacity,
then
in
that
instance,
although
the
conduct
was
unlawful,
by
virtue
of
this
hypothetical
second
decision,
the
conduct
would
not
be
clearly
established
and
there'd
be
no
liability
in
that
situation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
disagree.
i
think
that
in
anderson
against
creighton
itself,
this
court
noted
that
there's
not
a
requirement
that
the
previous
case
law
be
on
all
four--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i'm
not
sure
if
that's
the
only
case
where
that's
going
to
be
true.
i
think
there
other
cases
where
the
preexisting
law,
although
not
showing
the
way
with
pinpoint
accuracy,
it
still
provides
the
officers
with
sufficiently
clear
notice
that
there's
no
real
rule
for
qualified
immunity
in
those
particular
cases.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
the
judge
in
this
case
would
charge
by
using
the
language
from
this
court's
previous
qualified
immunity
opinions,
language
from
cases
like
malley
and
hunter
against
bryant
and
would
charge
the
jury
with
finding...
in
order
to
find
liability
in
this
case,
the
jury
would
have
to
find
that
the
individual
officer
exhibited...
either
was
plainly
incompetent
or
exercised
judgment
that
was
outside
the
range
of
professional
judgment.
i'm
not
sure
it
would
really
be
necessary
in
a
case
where
the
only
issue
is
liability
to
really
direct
the
court's
attention
a
great
deal
to
the
liability
standard
because
that
issue's
going
to
effectively
drop
out
of
the
case.
to
be
sure,
the
jury
may
need
to
be
instructed
on
what
the
relevant
law
of
excessive
force
is,
but
once
that
instruction
is
put
in
place
as
sort
a
background
instruction
then
the
real
question
that
the
jury
needs
to
focus
on
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
officer's
conduct
was
so
unreasonable
that
it
put
it
outside
the
range
of
professional--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--all
i
meant
by
that
is
that
since
there
will
be
no
liability
imposed
in
the
ordinary
case
without
a
finding
that
the
officer's
not
entitled
to
qualified
immunity,
it'll
be
the
qualified
immunity
question
that
will
really
be
the
ultimate
focus
of
the
jury's
attention
because
that'll
determine
whether
or
not
they
find
sufficient
cause
to
award
damages.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
believe
so.
no,
i'm
sorry
you're
right.
if
they
do
find
that
there's
not
qualified
immunity
because
the
conduct
was
clearly
established.
i
don't
know
that
they
really
need
to
go
further
because
that
perforce
will
already
incorporate
the
underlying
fourth
amendment
test.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
all
i'm
saying
is
that
in
the
ordinary
case--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i'm
sorry.
i
think...
perhaps
my
focusing
on
the
cases
that
go
to
the
jury,
we're
obscuring
the
fact
that
the
real
virtue
of
qualified
immunity
is
in
many
of
these
cases,
even
under
the
plaintiff's
versions
of
events,
the
conduct
will
not
be
so
clearly
unconstitutional
by
virtue
of
higher
precedent
that
the
court
can
just
end
there.
and
after
all,
as
this
court
emphasized
in
harlow
against
fitzgerald
and
subsequent
cases,
the
qualified
immunity
is
not
just
an
immunity
from
liability,
but
it
protects
the
officers
from
the
chilling
effect
of
the
inconvenience
of
having
to
stand
trial
in
those
situations
where
prior
decisions
have
not
clearly
marked
the
individual's
conduct
as
being
unlawful.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
both
questions
certainly
could
go
to
the
jury.
it
just
seems
to
me
that
the
second
question
actually
entails
the
answer
to
the
first.
so
if
the
jury's
instructed
and
finds
that
the
officer's
conduct
was
so
excessive
as
to
put
it
outside
the
range
of
the
conduct
of
a
reasonable
officer
under
the
circumstances
it
would
necessarily
entail
a
finding
in
liability.
and
because
by
hypothesis
i'm
talking
about
a
case
where
all
the
individual
plaintiff
seeks
is
monetary
damages,
the
court
may
well
have
a
forum
that
asks
the
court...
the
jury
to
find
the
liability...
i'm
sorry,
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
right.
nothing
will
turn
on
the
underlying
constitutional
issue
because
it's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
guess
what
i'm
envisioning
is
that
the
jury
would
first
be
instructed
on
what
the
law
is
of
excessive
force
based
largely
on
this
court's
decision
in
graham
against
connor.
then
at
the
end
of
the
instructions,
the
court
would
focus
in
on
what
it
is
the
jury
needs
to
find
in
order
to
find
liability
and
impose
liability
on
the
officer.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
sure.
i
think
the
instruction,
i
mean
the
instruction
that
the
government
typically
uses
in
these
cases
or
typically
offers
in
these
cases,
is
based
on
this
court's
decision
in
malley
and
hunter
against
bryant
and
it
asks
the
jury
whether
or
not
the
officer's
conduct
was
such
that
it
was
plainly
incompetent
under
the
circumstances
and
the
use
of
force
was
outside
the
range
of
professional
and
competent
judgment.
and
then
the
jury...
that's
the
question
that
jury
ultimately
focuses
on.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
that's
the
qualified
immunity
question
because
that's
what
makes
the
difference
between
whether
the
jury
in
a
specific
case
imposes
damages
or
doesn't
impose
damages.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
the
difference
is...
well
there's
a
couple
of
ways
of
expressing
it,
one
way
to
express
it
is
that
the
fourth
amendment
test
looks
only
at
the
conduct
and
asks
whether
the
force
used
was
unreasonable.
the
qualified
immunity
test
takes
a
broader
look
at
what
the
preexisting
law
was
and
asks
whether
the
officer
was
on
notice
that
his
or
conduct
violated
clearly-established
law.
another
way
of
looking
at
is
that
the
question
in
the
first
case
is
simply,
looking
at
what
the
officer
did,
was
what
the
officer
did
reasonable?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
also
correct.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
i
mean...
and
i
think
that
raises
two
important
points.
first
of
all,
this
issue
of
what
issue
goes
to
the
jury
and
how
does
the
underlying
fourth
amendment
issue
interact
with
the
qualified
immunity
instruction
is
not
unique
to
the
context
of
excessive
force
claims.
the
same
issues
are
raised
by
the
probable
cause
and
exigent
circumstances
issues--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--nothing.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
nothing
went
to
the
jury,
which
is
the
second
point,
which
is
this
would
be
a
particularly
poor
vehicle--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
certainly
not
in
our
view.
i
mean,
our
view
you
can
take
every
fact
in
this
case
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
plaintiff
and
the
proper
analysis
should
still
be
that
the
petitioner
was
entitled
to
qualified
immunity.
and
the
court
of
appeals
below
simply
refused
to
undertake
that
analysis
because
they
thought
the
two
standards
were
effectively
merged.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
all
respect,
i--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--first
of
all,
an
example
would
be
in
the
tenth
circuit
situation
where
the
court
finds
in
the
same
case
that
the
hog-tie
restraint
when
applied
to
someone
who's
exhibited
signs
of
diminished
capacity
is
unreasonable.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
the
should
have
known
aspect
of
the
test
is
precisely
what
qualified
immunity
adds.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
the
substantive
test
is
whether
or
not
the
use
of
force
under
the
circumstances
was
unreasonable.
the
should
have
known
aspect--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--the
reasonableness
test
is
taken
from
the
perspective
of
the
reasonable
officer
and
it
grants
the
officer
deference
and
allows
for
reasonable
mistakes
of
fact.
what
it
doesn't
allow
for
is
reasonable
mistakes
of
law.
if
the
officer's
in
a
position
where
he's
confronted
with
a
situation
and
he
makes
a
factual
mistake.
he
thinks
the
suspect
is
resisting
arrest,
but
he's
really
not.
the
graham
against
connor
standard
takes
the
perspective
of
the
reasonable
officer
and
grants
deference
to
the
officer.
but
in
a
situation
where
there's
no
question.
the
person
wasn't
resisting
and
the
court
announces
a
rule
that
says
that,
absent
that
kind
of
resistance,
the
use
of
force
in
this
case
is
unreasonable.
the
officer
may
still
be
entitled
to
qualified
immunity,
if
the
prior
law
did
not
put
the
individual
officer
on
notice
that
that
use
of
force
under
the
circumstances,
was
unreasonable.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that
is
the
relationship,
but
i
would
hesitate
to
add
that
it's
not
limited
to
the
jury
situation
and
i
think
that
same
difference
allows
the
court--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
we
submit
this
is
an
appropriate
case
to
resolve
even
before
the
jury
that
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
case,
even
if
they
constitute
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
which
i
think
is
a
reasonable
question
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
they
nonetheless
were
not
so
clearly
established
that
the
officer
was
on
notice
and
qualified
immunity
is
appropriate.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
that's
right.
i
mean
there
may
be
situations
where
the
claim
is
fairly
well-decided,
but
there's
some
reason
why
a
reasonable
officer
would
be
entitled
to
rely
on
the
prior
law.
i
mean,
the
example
of
a
case
where
the
court
previously
expressly
reserves
the
question,
even
if
in
a
subsequent
case,
the
government
doesn't
have
a
great
argument
why
the
court
shouldn't
extend
the
rule,
i
think
it
would
still
be
appropriate
to
give
the
officer
qualified
immunity
under
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
wish
i
could
give
you
a
clean
answer.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
in
this
very
case,
it's
a
little
hard
to
apply
those
principles.
if
i
could
back
away
to
the...
in
the
tenth
circuit
example,
if
the
only
issue
is
whether
the
individual
has
exhibited
diminished
city--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well
in
this
case,
it's
a
little
hard
to
understand
what
the
ninth
circuit's
reasoning
was
why
there
was
a
violation
here.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
they
would
be
instructed
on
both,
but
i
think
they
would
ultimately
only
be
asked
to
decide
the
ultimate
qualified
immunity
test
because
there's
really--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
that's
right.
i
think
that
the
instruction
on
the
given
law
of
the
fourth
amendment
would
be
necessary
background
information
for
the
jury
to
make
its
decision,
but
i'm
not
sure
there
would
be
any
real
purpose
served
by
having
the
jury
say,
yes
there
was
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
certainly
a
judge
could
ask
that
question,
but
where
the
rubber
meets
the
road
in
these
cases
is
whether
or
not
there's
qualified
immunity
because
that
will
determine
whether
the
plaintiff
has--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i'll
get
to
that
right
now.
i
think
one
way
to
focus
on
this
case
is,
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
done
the
proper
analysis,
how
would
they
have
defined
the
fourth
amendment
violation
in
this
case?
it
seems
to
us
that
one
of
the
things
they
would
have
focused
on
is
the
failure
of
these
officers
to
announce
their
intention
to
take
mr.
katz
out
before
they
actually
grabbed
him
and
took
him
out
of
the
area.
now
that
kind
of
speak
first
or
warning
requirement,
at
least
in
a
nondeadly-force
context,
seems
to
us
to
be
a
new
rule
or
something
that's
certainly
not
clearly
established
on
which
a
reasonable
officer
would
be
on
notice
of.
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
approached
it
that
way,
focused
in
on
that
as
being
the
key
factor
that
made
the
actions
of
the
officers
here
unreasonable
then
we
could
very
legitimately
ask
the
question,
was
that
clearly
established?
and
our
position
would
be
of
course
not.
but
other
people
could
take
a
different
view.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
absolutely.
i
think
the
first
thing
to
recognize
is
the
ninth
circuit
took
an
extreme
view,
that
qualified
immunity
is
never
appropriate
in
excessive
force
cases.
the
first
and
most
important
thing
this
court
can
do
is
to
disabuse
the
ninth
circuit
of
that
notion.
then
applying
the
principles
to
this
case,
it
could
usefully
decide
whether
or
not
there's
qualified
immunity
in
this
case.
in
doing
so,
it
could
very
well
follow
the
reasoning
that
i
just
outlined
which
is
to
say
what
would
make
this
case
an
example
of
excessive
force,
if
anything,
must
be
this
failure
to
warn
first.
now,
the
ninth
circuit...
this
court
can
either
decide
that
issue
if
it's
liked
or
just
kind
of,
for
purposes
of
the
annunciation
of
the
rule,
assume
it,
but
then
it
could
say
that
principle
is
not
clearly
established.
if
possible,
i'd
to
reserve
the
remaining
to
time
for
follow-up.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
would
stop
you
there.
no,
i
would
stop
you
there.
the
first
question
is
simply
to
ask
whether
on
those
facts
the
use
of
force
from
the
perspective
of
a
reasonable
officer
was
reasonable.
now
if
the
court
thinks
not--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
a
fine
statement
of
the
qualified
immunity
standard.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
what
i
was
focusing
on
though
is
that
i
think
if
you
really
want
to
address
the
order
that
the
judge
should
address
the
issue.
first
they
should
address
the
issue
of
liability
because
that's
what
this
court
has
said
on
a
number
of
occasions,
including
siegert
against
gilley
and--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--unless
the
underlying
facts
are
in
dispute.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
yeah,
that's
right.
i'm
sorry.
now
one
thing
i
want
to
add
though--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yeah,
and
all
i
want
to
emphasize
is
i
think
that
misses
the
fourth
amendment
step
that
this
court
has
said
has
to
proceed
the
qualified
immunity
test
and
it's
helpful
to
establish
what
the
qualified
immunity
violation
is
because
that's
helpful
in
identifying
whether
or
not
the
officers
had
fair
notice
that
that
fourth
amendment
principle
actually
applied.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
like
to
make
three
points.
first
for
those
of
you
who
have
reviewed
the
videotape,
the
very
fact
that
this
court
could
disagree
with
ninth
circuit
about
whether
there
was
excessive
force
used
in
this
case
underscores
the
need
for
qualified
immunity
for
officers
in
the
field
because
clearly
graham
against
connor
did
not
answer
every
case
and
did
not
provide
officers
on
crystal
clear
notice
of
where
the
lines
were
in
the
excessive-force
context.
the
second
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
simply
that
jury
instruction
issues
and
the
question
of
what
goes
to
the
jury
and
what
the
judge
should
decide,
those
issues
are
not
unique
to
the
excessive-force
context.
those
same
issues
arise
under
probable
cause
and
exigent
circumstance
in
anderson
against
creighton.
and
mr.
boyd's
actually
correct
that
some
of
the
circuits
have
taken
divergent
views
on
that.
it
may
be
appropriate
for
the
court
eventually
to
take
up
that
issue,
but
as
justice
o'connor
has
pointed
out,
this
case
would
be
an
incredibly
poor
vehicle
to
do
so
since
we're
here
on
summary
judgment
and
the
ninth
circuit's
denial
of
summary
judgment
and
the
government's
position
continues
to
be
that
that
grant
of...
that
denial
of
summary
judgment
was
inappropriate
and
this
court
should
reverse
that.
finally,
i
want
to
clarify
that
despite
what
may
have
been
said
here
it
is
not
accurate
to
say
that
the
ninth
circuit,
or
at
least
graham
itself,
incorporates
the
test
of
anderson
against
creighton.
graham
itself
does
allow
officers
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
when
it
comes
to
reasonable
mistakes
of
fact.
it
doesn't
grant
them
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
when
it
comes
to
reasonable
mistakes
of
law.
and
it
doesn't
incorporate
into
its
reasonableness
test
the
notion
of
what
the
preexisting
law
was
and
it's
a
good
thing
that
it
doesn't
because
if
that
were
the
case,
then
the
fourth
amendment
law
would
be
frozen
in
place.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
think
that's
what
we're
asking,
with
all
due
respect
justice
kennedy.
i
think
what
we're
asking
is
that
the
officers
be
put
on
fair
warning
that
their
conduct
is
unlawful.
justice
souter
in
an
opinion
for
the
court
in
united
states
against
lanier
addressed
this
issue
in
the
context
of
18
u.s.c.
242
and
made
clear
that
what's
required
in
that
context,
and
he
noted
that
the
same
rule
applies
in
qualified
immunity,
is
the
officers
have
fair
warning
because
the
principles,
the
general
principles,
have
been
made
specific
is
the
term
he
used,
by
application
through
prior
cases.
the
eleventh
circuit
in
a
case
called
lassiter
against
alabama
a&m
expressed
the
same
concept
by
saying
that
what
you
need
is
the
prior
case
law
that's
materially
similar.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
that's
why
i
want
to
insist--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--absolutely.
absolutely,
because
graham
against
connor
itself
does
not
build
in
reasonable
mistakes
of
law
or
take
into
account
what
the
preexisting
law
was.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
exactly
right,
because
if
it
were
otherwise
then
the
very
fact
that
prior
law
didn't
put
an
officer
on
notice
and
there
was
unclarity
would
itself
mean
that
the
conduct
was
lawful
and
then
there'd
be
no
mechanism
for
the
law
to
provide
clarity
in
the
fourth
amendment
context.
it's
the
same
idea
as
to
why
this
court
asked
lower
courts
to
deal
with
the
liability...
the
constitutional
issue
first
and
only
the
immunity
question
second.
the
last
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
about
what
the
rationale
of
the
ninth
circuit
below
was
in
a
subsequent
case
decided
last
week.
