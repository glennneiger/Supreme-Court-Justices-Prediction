chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
99-1977.
saucier
against
katz.
mr.
clement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
whole
thing
is
going
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury
at
one
time
i
take
it
in
a
series
of
instruction.
now
you
say,
ordinarily
the...
something
will
drop
out
of
the
liability
phase,
but
i
didn't
quite
follow
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if...
then
the
jury,
if
a
jury
decides
that
there
is
not
qualified
immunity
then
they
have
to
go
further,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
justice
scalia
may
see
what
you
mean,
but
i'm
not
sure
i
do.
tell
me
how
the
judge
charges
the
jury
with
respect...
does
he
tell
the
jury,
first
go
to
qualified
immunity
or
first
go
to
constitutional
violation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
give
my
just
a
quick
sample
instruction
rather
than
this
kind
of
theoretical
description?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that's
the
fourth
amendment
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
tell
me
then,
what
is
the
difference
between
the
fourth
amendment
question
and
the
qualified
immunity
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
clement,
your...
you
raise...
the
government
raises
two
questions
in
its
petition
for
certiorari
and
the
second
one
is
did
the
court
of
appeals
err
in
concluding
on
the
basis
facts
noted
that
the
defendant's
use
of
force
in
arresting
this
particular
plaintiff,
are
you
going
to
get
to
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
clement.
mr.
boyd
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
what
i
thought
too.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
they
look
at
a
different
video?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
have
been
a
lot
of
questions
from
the
bench
about
jury
instructions.
certainly
i
asked,
but
this
case
itself
did
not
go
to
the
jury.
we're
talking
about
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
that
says
you
cannot
grant
summary
judgment
to
the
officer
on
the
record
as
we
saw
it
and
i
take
it
you
defend
that
decision.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
therefore,
if
you're...
if
we're
simply
talking
about
this
particular
decision,
we
don't
get
to
any
jury
instructions
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
but
on
this
particular
record,
the
vice
president
is
speaking,
this
guy
gets
up
to
the
front,
raises
a
banner
and
he's
taken
out
and
put
in
a
van.
what's
unreasonable
about
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
was
simply
pushed?
that
makes
it
unreasonable?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
that
mean
that
we
couldn't
find
differently?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
doesn't
really
answer
the
legal
point
that
justice
souter
and
justice
scalia
have
asked
you
about.
since
there's...
in
anderson
we
say
that
the
probable
cause
standard
does
not
answer
the
question
of
qualified
immunity,
why
shouldn't
the...
we
say
the
same
thing
about
unreasonable
force.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
should
that
make
a
difference
for
fourth
amendment
purposes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
boyd.
mr.
clement,
you
have
three
minutes...
or
four
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
clement.
the
case
is
submitted.
