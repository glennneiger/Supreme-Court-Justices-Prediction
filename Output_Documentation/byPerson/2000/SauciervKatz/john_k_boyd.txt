mr.
john
k.
boyd
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
walk
this
court
through
the
process
and
the
steps
so
that
there's
an
understanding
of
how
anderson
and
graham
are
being
used
effectively
now
in
the
trial
courts
in
order
to
weed
out
insubstantial
cases
and
to
have
the
jurors
decide
these
issues
in
a
way
that
both
the
individual's
right
to
a
remedy
and
provides
the
insulation
that
the
officers
need.
now
the
starting
point
is
with
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
at
that
point
and
i
know
this
both
from
representing
police
officers
and
from
representing
plaintiffs
at
trial
in
the
federal
trial
courts.
the
first
step
is,
you
move
to
dismiss
on
the
defense
side
and
you
take
out
anderson
and
you
say
could
the
officer
have...
whether
the
officer
could
have
reasonably
believed
that
they
could
use
the
amount
of
force
that
they
did.
anderson
sets
that
straight
out.
and
then
the
next
thing
you
do
is
you
take
graham
to
inform
the
decision,
which
is
why
the
opinion
is
such
a
brilliant
one,
because
it
provides
the
specifics.
it
provides
a
three-step
test.
how
severe
was
the
crime?
was
the
person
armed
and
dangerous,
dangerous
to
the
police
and
to
the
other
members
of
the
public
and
was
there
resistance?
and
so
if
you
take
this
case
for
instance,
they
claim
that
dr.
katz
had
resisted
arrest.
now
if
dr.
katz
resisted
arrest
in
this
case,
judge
jensen,
a
seasoned
trial
lawyer
himself,
would
have
thrown
this
case
out
in
an
instant
using
anderson
and
using
graham.
he
would
have
said
the
reasonable
officer
could
believe
that
because
there
was
resistance,
you
can
use
additional
force.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
what
it
does
do,
justice
scalia,
is
it
gives
a
buffer
for
the
trial
court
judge
to
get
rid
of
an
insubstantial
case.
if
someone's
engaged
in
a
severe--
mr.
john
k.
boyd
--i
can
tell
you
that
in
practice
it
gives
the
trial
court
judges
the
language
that
they
need
to
be
able
to
eliminate
these
insubstantial
claims,
the
claims
that
are
made
by
someone
who's
engaged
in
a
serious
crime
like
a
rape
or
an
armed
robbery
who
then
comes
around
and
says,
oh,
you
shouldn't
have
shot
me
and
then
those
cases
can
easily
be
moved
by
the
client--
mr.
john
k.
boyd
--right.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
right,
so
let's--
mr.
john
k.
boyd
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
i
would
be
shocked.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
the
testimony
that
was
given
by
both
parker
and
saucier
was
they
both
put
dr.
katz
into
the
back
of
that
van
and
it's
the...
the
part
of
it
is
that
if
indeed
that
dr.
katz
was
resisting
then,
yes,
that
was
a
fair
amount
of
force
to
use,
but
that's
the
question
that
has
to
go
back
to
the
trial
court
here
too,
is
that
dr.
katz
said
that
he
was
not
resisting
and
when
you
do
look
at
that
video
you
can
see
that
he
was
not.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
your
honor,
according
to
the
testimony
of
mr.
saucier
there
was
resistance
and
so
they
had
to
put
their
heads
up
to
figure
out
what
to
do.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
i
think
that
what
i
would
ask
you
to
look
for
is
what
was
seen
by
judge
jensen
and
also
judge
thompson
writing
for
a
unanimous
court,
affirming--
mr.
john
k.
boyd
--no,
your
honor.
they
looked--
mr.
john
k.
boyd
--your
honor,
because
the
reason
we're
here
is
that
you
can
tell
that
there
is
a
gratuitous
use
of
force
by
both
of
them.
there
was
force
that
was--
mr.
john
k.
boyd
--but
they
both
engaged
in
the
conduct
together
and
that
is
their
own
testimony
in
their
depositions.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
yeah,
and
i...
i
actually
think
the
most
important
thing...
i
don't
think
that
the
facts
can
be
resolved
here.
i
think
that
the
facts
need
to
be
resolved
at
trial
and
the
most
important
thing
here
is
to
adopt
a
standard.
and
as
you
asked
about
the...
and
the
chief
justice
as
well,
asked
about
what
is
the
standard
and
what
are
the
instructions
that
are
supposed
to
be
given?
the
problem
here
is
that
what
they
are
asking
for
by
way
of
the
standard
is
that
not
only
is
the
jury
to
make
the
first
decision
based
upon
whether
or
not
the
fourth
amendment
was
violated
and
qualified
immunity
to
be
built
into
that,
but
thereafter
then
they're
asking
for
a
second
application
on
the
jury
instructions.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
at
the
summary
judgment
level,
yes,
there
are
two
inquiries
that
are
being
made
both
on
the
qualified
immunity
and
on
the
fourth
amendment
and
they
are
intertwined
and
they're
being
made
by
the
trial
judge
at
that
point.
the
important
thing
is
that
the
qualified
immunity
is
not
providing
for
a
higher
degree
of
protection
in
that,
whatever
you
adopt
as
your
standard
at
the
summary
judgment
level
is
then
going
to
carryover
to
the
directed
verdict
level.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
no,
he
is
not,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
there
will
be
qualified
immunity
because
there's
no
established
precedent.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
well,
except
that
where
we
depart
is,
and
when
you
look
at
pages
5
and
15
of
their
reply
brief,
you
see
that
they're
asking
for
an
additional
margin
of
protection
and
that's
why...
what's
surprising
is
that
when
the
government--
mr.
john
k.
boyd
--the
additional
margin
is
that
typically
as
in
the
mcnair
case
what
they
attempt
to
do
is
that
after
the
jury
has
returned
a
verdict,
and
i've
seen
this
happen
in
the
northern
district
as
well
in
a
case
that
we
won
just
a
year
ago,
after
the
verdict
comes
back
then
the--
mr.
john
k.
boyd
--the
verdict
is
in
favor
of
the
plaintiffs
after
the
instructions
have
been
given.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
yes...
no
during--
mr.
john
k.
boyd
--no,
the
jury
typically
under
hunter
in
this
court,
it's
been
directed
that
the
court
makes
the
qualified
immunity.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
correct.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
the
government
lawyer
jumps
up
and
says,
thank
you,
ladies
and
gentlemen
for
coming
in,
but
now,
your
honor,
i
want
you
to
second
guess,
i
want
you
to
reassess
this
case.
this
is
exactly
what
happens.
it's
exactly
what
happened
in
mcnair
without
even
moving
under
rule
50
and
that's
the
problematic
thing
that
this
court--
mr.
john
k.
boyd
--no,
your
honor.
this
has
not
gone
to
the
jury
yet.
and
then
the
key
question
here
is,
when
it
goes
back
to
judge
jensen
and
he
has
to
decide
and
then
it
goes
to
the
jury
on
the
issues
of
fact
that
are
present.
there
are
issues
of
fact.
that's
what
the
trial
court
judge
said
and
the
appellate
court.
and
when
it
goes
back
is
judge
jensen
then
going
to
second
guess
the
jury?
if
they
were
to
return
a
verdict
in
this
case--
mr.
john
k.
boyd
--it's
unclear
what
they're
asking
for,
your
honor,
and
what
they've
said
before
is
that
it
should
be
the
court
that
makes
the
decision.
now,
today
they're
talking
about
jury
instructions.
and
if
what
they're
asking
for
is
that
the
jurors
are
going
to
be
given
some
additional
instructions
on
qualified
immunity
then
the
problem
is,
and
this
goes
back
to
justice
kennedy's
early
questions,
it's
totally
unworkable
at
that
point.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
it's
asking
for...
that...
it
really
is
a
procedural
secondary
review
of
the
decision
to
be
made
by
the
jury
or
they're
asking
for
a
second
set
of
jury
instructions.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
your
honor,
i
think
this
may
answer
justice
souter's
question
as
well,
but
what
we
heard
from
my
brother
was
that
the
instruction
on
the
issue
of
graham
is
not
even
necessary
for
them
to
decide.
that
was
a
response
to
one
of
the
questions.
they
may
not
even
reach
that
because
qualified
immunity
now
is
going
to
provide
for
the
higher
standard.
that's
what
they're
looking
for
and
i
think
that
is
contrary
to
graham.
it
would
supplant
graham,
it's
unnecessary,
and
it
would
make
it
unworkable
in
that
he
jury
instructions
that
would
be
given
would
be...
the
way
that
this
works
in
practice
is
that
the
instructions
that
they've
asked
for,
and
i've
seen
them,
they
ask,
after
the
jury
has
decided
that
the
officer
acted
in
objectively
unreasonable
manner
then
they
ask
whether
the
officer
could
have
reasonably
believed
that
he
could
act
unreasonably
and
they
expect
the
jurors
to
do
this.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
and
do
you
know
when
they
go
over
the
line,
and
i
know
this
from
representing
them,
the
instructions
that
you
use
in
closing
are
the
ones
that
are
based
on
graham
saying
a
mistake's
not
enough,
no
20/20
hindsight,
you
don't
have
to
use
the
least
amount
of
force
necessary,
that
this
is
a
severe
crime,
the
guy
was
armed
and
dangerous.
you
give
the
officer
a
break
and
you're
out
of
there.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
yes.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
no,
the
only...
the
concern
though,
is
that
whatever
you
establish
as
the
summary
judgment
standard
gets
carried
over
to
the
directed
verdict
and
that's
why
the
decisions
that
have
been
made
by
the
sixth,
seventh,
ninth
and
d.c.
circuits
are
so
solid
is
because
they
take
anderson
and
graham
and
apply
them
together
and
that
the
big
mess
arises
when
you
try
to
then
put
an
additional
boost
on
qualified
immunity.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
the
part
that's
unreasonable
is
the
way
that
he
was
put
into
that
van
if
he
was
not
resisting
arrest.
certainly
there's
a
question
of
fact.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
the
way
that
he
was
pushed
by
those
officers,
i
think
if
you
were
to
show
it
to
the
people
in
this
room--
mr.
john
k.
boyd
--well,
your
honor,
the
testimony
of
both
officers
is
that
they
both
engaged
in
that
conduct
together.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
well,
this
is
why
you
have
a
disputed
issue
of
fact.
the
video
shows
that
dr.
katz
was
not
resisting
and
yet
you
wouldn't
assume
that
as
a
fact.
that's
a
fact
for
the
jury
to
decide.
they
will
decide
whether--
mr.
john
k.
boyd
--because
that
would
be
for
the
jury.
there
are
things...
for
instance,
saucier
says
that--
mr.
john
k.
boyd
--well,
both
judge
jensen,
who
made
his
career
as
a
prosecutor
and
judge
thompson,
who's
also
a
conservative,
seasoned
judge,
felt
that
there
is
a
question
of
fact
that
needed
to
go
to
the
jury.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
of
course,
your
honor,
you
are
the
supreme
court.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
i
think
that's
very
close,
but
in
practice
the
point
that
i
really
want
to
have
understood
by
this
court
that
the
ninth
circuit
standard
is
that
qualified
immunity
is
alive
and
well
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
but
anderson
does
apply
except
it
applies
at
the
same
level
as
the
fourth
amendment.
and
the
difference,
your
honor,
is
that
with
an
excessive
force
case
like
this,
this
is
where
you're
right
at
the
juncture
where
physical
force
is
being
used
by
federal
officials
against
individuals.
what
you
have
here
are
federal
lawyers
asking
federal
judges
to
make
federal
officials
immune
from
the
bill
of
rights.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
exactly.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
exactly.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
exactly.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
your
honor,
the
difference
is,
here
we
have
graham
subsequent
to
anderson
and
also
i
think
as
justice
souter
pointed
out
that...
that...
here,
and
i
think
this
also
part
of
the
crux
of
it
with
the
excessive
force,
is
that
you're
dealing
with
the
actual
physical
contact
the
police
come
into
effect
with
people.
and
graham
has
set
forth
some
very
specific
standards
that
can
apply
where
you--
mr.
john
k.
boyd
--and
the
two
together,
graham
and
anderson,
are
being
used
in
order
to
provide
the
police
officers
the
insulation
that
they
need
to
be
able
to
carry
on
their
duties
without
being
unduly
timid
in
the
process.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
you're
correct.
that
is
not
part
of
our
case
that
they
should
have
given
him
particularly
notice.
it
is
how
they
treated
him
that
raises
the
question
of
fact.
and
the
important
thing
here,
and
this
gets
to
the
crux
of
the
qualified
immunity
and
the
interactions
with
the
fourth
amendment,
is
that
they
are
providing
the
means
for
the
trial
court
judges
to
take
care
of
the
insubstantial
cases
now
and
to
provide
the
officers
with
the
insulation
they
need
while
still
preserving
a
remedy.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
i
think
primarily,
your
honor,
because
with
unreasonable
force
you're
dealing
with
an
area
where
they're
in
direct
physical
contact
with
the
people.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
because
of
the
nature
of
it.
this
cuts
right
to
the
heart
of
the
intent
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
serve
as
a
check
on
federal
officials
and
there's
nothing
in
the
fourth
amendment
making
a
textural
analysis
of
it
that
provides
for
an
immunity.
and
so
there
should
be
one,
but
it
should
not
be
untethered
and
so
in
the
excessive
force
case
we
have
the
benefit
of
graham.
graham
has
left
a
wonderful
legacy.
it's
been
cited
2,685
times
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
it's
working
and
it's
working
along
with
anderson.
and
what
they're
talking
about
now
is
an
expansion
of
the
qualified
immunity
that
would
just
supplant
graham,
unnecessarily
so,
and
raise
seventh
amendment
issues.
mr.
john
k.
boyd
no,
it's
not
that
anderson
is
wrong
it's
that
anderson
has
been
incorporated
into
the
ninth
circuit
standard
and
anderson
is
alive
and
well.
and
the
fact
is
that
now,
and
i
see
that
my
five-minute
light
is
on,
and
i
don't
feel
that
there's
a
need
to
try
to
make
every
single
point
but
what's
essential
here
is
that
there's
no
better
way
to
preserve
rights
than
to
put
them
in
writing.
and
there's
no
better
guardians
of
written
rights
than
judges
and
here
in
this
context,
well
ought
to
remember
the
words
of
justice
marshall
saying
that
if
we're
to
be
a
government
of
laws
and
not
of
men
that
there
must
be
a
remedy
for
the
violation
of
a
constitutional
right.
and
at
the
same
time
we
have
balance
that
against
the
need
to
insulate
the
officers,
i
recognize
that,
but
this
is
a
case
where
judges--
mr.
john
k.
boyd
--almost
every
time,
based
upon
the
uncertainty
now
that
exists
in
this
area
and
this
is
where
the
court
in
its
opinion
really
needs
to
come
out
and--
mr.
john
k.
boyd
--well,
it
depends.
some
of
the
time
it's
going
to
the
jury
on
two
sets
of
jury
instructions.
this
is
where
there's
confusion
in
the
circuits
and
some
of
the
time
it's
going
to
the
jury
on
graham
and
then
they
give
it
to
the
judge,
as
in
mcnair,
to
apply
qualified
immunity
after
the
jury.
and
that's
when
you
run
into
direct
conflict
with
the
seventh
amendment.
and
that's
why
the
most
important
thing
for
this
court
to
make
clear
and
why
to
adopt
the
ninth
circuit
standard
is
because
it
sets
forth
a
clear
workable
test
so
that
after
the
jury
has
decided
based
on
jury
instructions
incorporating
both
anderson
and
graham,
that
then
there's
no
second
guessing
by
the
judge.
because,
your
honors,
it's
in
the...
there
are
moments
when
it's
up
to
the
judges
to
decide
to
make
sure
that
the
rights
are
not
deteriorating
and
that's
exactly
what's
happened
here
both
with
judge
jensen
and
with
judge
thompson
in
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit.
and
so
we
would
urge
this
court
to
follow
the
decisions
of
the
sixth,
seventh,
ninth,
tenth
and
d.c.
circuits
that
strike
the
proper
balance
between
preserving
the
remedy
for
the
individual
and
insulating
the
police
officers
in
the
performance
of
their
duties.
with
that
i
have
nothing
further
and
i
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
