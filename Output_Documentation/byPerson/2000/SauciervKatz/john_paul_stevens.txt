justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
yes
or
no
question,
to
make
sure
i
understand
your
response
to
the
chief
justice
earlier.
assume
there's
a
question
of
fact
that
made
it
improper
to
resolve...
for
the
judge
to
resolve
the
qualified
immunity
issue.
he
thought
he
would
have
to
submit
that
to
the
jury.
when
the
case
is
tried
at
the
jury,
would
the
judge
instruct
on
both
the
liability
issue
and
the
qualified
immunity
issue
or
only
on
one,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
very
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
want
to
talk
about
the
tenth
circuit
case.
i'm
interested
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
question
is,
assuming
there's
a
question
of
fact
that
would
decide
the
qualified
immunity
issue
in
this
very
case,
which
officer
pushed
him
in
the
truck
or
something
like
and
you
have
to
have
jury
trial
on
the
qualified
immunity
issue.
my
question
is,
would
the
jury
be
instructed
on
both
qualified
immunity
and
liability
or
on
just
one
of
the
two?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
given
an
instruction
on
an
issue
they're
not
asked
to
decide?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
based
on
your
experience
of
these
cases,
how
often
does
the
issue
of
qualified
immunity
actually
go
to
the
jury,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
in
almost
every
case
it
goes
to
the
jury?
