mr.
clement,
it
might
help
if
you
gave
us,
what
would
be
the...
suppose
the
judge
thinks,
i
don't
want
to
decide
the
qualified
immunity
myself
because
i
think
there's
some
fact
questions
involved
about
what
happened
here.
so
let's
take
this
very
case
and
the
judge
wants
to
charge
the
jury
so
they'll
understand
the
difference
between
excessive
force
that
violates
the
fourth
amendment
and
qualified
immunity.
how
would
the
judge
charge
in
this
very
case?
justice
ruth
bader

mr.
boyd,
may
i
ask
you
to
tell
me
your
view
on
something
that
mr.
clement
brought
up
and
i
thought
in
bringing
it
up
he
was
trying
to
make
this
case
a
little
bit
like
the
hog-tie
case.
he
said
the
crux
of
the
excessive
force
case
here
was
that
they
didn't
give
him
notice,
some
kind
of
notice,
and
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
your
position.
i
thought
that
your
position
was
they
didn't
need
to
give
him
the
bum's
rush.
they
didn't
need
to
push
him
in.
he
was
elderly,
frail
and
they
could
have
treated
him
gently.
now
there
this...
they
didn't
notify
him
to
stop
or
something
part
of
your
case?
