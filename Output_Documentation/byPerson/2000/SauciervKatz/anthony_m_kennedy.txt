justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
tell
me
how
the
test
works?
i
take
it
qualified
immunity
is
presented
initially
to
the
trial
judge
as
a
basis
for
dismissing
and
then
if
he
rules,
is
the
jury
also
instructed
about
qualified
immunity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now
suppose
he
overrules
the
qualified
immunity
defense,
does
the
jury
then
determine
both
qualified
immunity
and,
in
this
case,
whether
or
not
the
force
was
reasonable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
a
bifurcated
trial.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean
the
reason
i'm
asking
is
that,
if
the
jury
hears
both
questions,
i
want
to
know
what
the
instructions
sound
like,
and
whether
or
not
the
jury
can
make
this
distinction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
is
what
justice
ginsburg
was
asking
and
what
i
was
asking.
i'm
not
sure
how
the
jury
distinguishes
between
these
two
tests
and
you
seem
to
be
telling
us
they
don't
have
to
and
that
seems
to
be
inconsistent
with
your
position
that
there
are
two
tests.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
trouble
i'm
having
and
i
think
was
at
the
root
of
justice
ginsburg's
question
as
well.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
did
not
look
at
the
videotape
because
i
thought
we
were
talking
about
the
standards
we
have
to
use
and
the
videotape
was
just
irrelevant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
just
at
the
pretrial
stage,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
there's
a
role
for
the
court
that's
special
in
the
context
of
qualified
immunity.
the
court
knows
what
the
law
is
and
has
some
handle
on
what
a
reasonable
police
officer
should
know.
that
seems
to
be
more
of
a
legal
question
than
a
factual
question.
i
suppose
we
could
play
with
it
and
you
could
it
back
to
me.
and
so
it
does
seem
to
me
at
that
point
at
least,
the
tests
have
a
different
thrust
and
a
different
importance
and
a
different
significance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you're
asking
is
to
say
that
the
police
officer
is
entitled
to
know
in
every
case
precisely
what
he
must
do
and
i'm
not
sure
either
under
qualified
immunity
and
then
certainly
under
general
fourth
amendment
principles
we
can
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
1994
the
presidio
army
base
in
san
francisco
was
the
sight
of
an
event
to
celebrate
a
conversion
of
the
base
to
a
national
park.
it
has
long
been
an
important
and
very
beautiful
military
installation
that
has
been
turned
into
a
national
park.
among
the
speakers
in
attendance
was
then
vice
president
gore
and
about
the
time
the
vice
president
began
speaking
the
respondent
who
is
elliot
katz
removed
a
small
cloth
banner
from
his
jacket
and
started
to
unfold
it
and
walked
toward
a
waist
high
fence
that
surrounded
the
speaker’s
platform.
petitioners
donald
saucier
and
the
sergeant
steven
parker
were
both
military
police
officers
stationed
at
the
presidio.
now
they
moved
to
intercept
the
respondent
as
he
reached
the
barrier
the
officers
grabbed
him
and
rushed
him
out
of
the
area
to
a
nearby
van.
now,
respondent
claims
that
he
was
shoved
inside
and
that
he
caught
himself
just
in
time
to
avoid
injury.
respondent
brought
this
action
alleging
that
saucier
and
other
defendants
had
violated
his
fourth
amendment
rights
by
using
excessive
force
to
arrest
him.
the
district
court
held
with
a
dispute
on
a
material
fact
existed
as
to
whether
respondent
resisted
and
that
the
petitioner
was
not
entitled
to
summary
judgment.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
and
employed
a
two
part
analysis
for
qualified
immunity
and
this
is
a
test
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
applied
in
previous
cases
of
this
type.
the
court
of
appeals
asked
first
if
the
law
governing
officer’s
conduct
was
clearly
established,
and
it
was
clearly
established.
the
second
enquiry
in
the
court
of
appeals
analytic
framework
is
whether
a
reasonable
officer
could
have
believed
that
conduct
was
lawful.
in
this
second
step
the
court
holds
that
the
qualified
immunity
determination
and
the
merits
of
the
excessive
force
claim
both
turn
on
the
same
objective
reasonableness
test,
and
following
that
framework
in
this
case
the
court
held
summary
judgment
was
inappropriate,
since
the
jury
as
trier
of
fact
resolves
the
reasonableness
issue.
saucier
sought
review
here,
we
agree
with
his
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
incorrect
in
framing
the
enquiry,
so
we
now
reverse.
the
first
inquiry
under
qualified
immunity
must
be
whether
a
constitutional
right
would
have
been
violated
on
the
facts
alleged.
if
a
violation
could
be
made
out
on
these
facts
the
next
step
is
to
ask
whether
the
right
was
clearly
established.
this
question
must
be
undertaken
in
the
light
of
the
specific
context
of
the
case
and
not
as
the
court
of
appeals
viewed
it
as
a
broad
general
proposition.
in
1989
we
decided
a
case
called
graham
versus
connor
and
in
this
case
there
is
no
doubt
that
graham
clearly
establishes
the
general
proposition
that
use
of
force
is
excessive
if
it
is
not
objectively
reasonable.
yet
that
is
not
enough,
the
relevant
inquiry
is
whether
it
would
be
clear
to
a
reasonable
officer
that
the
conduct
was
lawful
in
the
situation
the
officers
then
confronted.
the
qualified
immunity
inquiry
has
a
further
dimension
as
well.
the
concern
that
the
immunity
inquiry
is
to
acknowledge
that
reasonable
mistakes
can
be
made
as
to
the
legal
constraints
on
particular
police
conduct.
it
is
sometimes
difficult
for
an
officer
to
determine
how
the
relevant
legal
doctrine
will
apply
to
the
precise
factual
situation
the
officer
confronts.
graham
does
not
always
give
a
clear
answer
as
to
whether
a
particular
application
of
force
will
be
deemed
excessive.
qualified
immunity
operates
in
this
case
then
just
as
it
does
in
other
ones
to
protect
officers
from
the
sometimes
hazy
border
between
excessive
and
acceptable
force.
these
circumstances
in
this
case
disclose
substantial
grounds
for
the
officer
to
have
concluded,
he
had
legitimate
justification
under
the
law
for
acting
as
he
did.
the
petitioner
did
not
know
the
full
extent
of
the
threat
respondent
posed,
or
how
many
other
persons
there
might
be
who
in
concert
with
the
respondent
posed
the
threat
to
the
security
of
the
vice
president
and
we
are
aware
of
no
case
demonstrating
a
clearly
established
rule
prohibiting
the
officer
from
acting
as
he
did
in
these
circumstances.
our
conclusion
is
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
the
force
was
not
so
excessive
that
respondent
suffered
any
injury.
for
these
reasons
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment,
which
justices
stevens
and
breyer
join;
justice
souter
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
