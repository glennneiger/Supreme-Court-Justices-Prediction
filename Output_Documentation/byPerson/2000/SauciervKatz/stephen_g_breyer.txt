justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
that
last
bit.
sorry,
that
last
bit
that
i'm
confused
on,
why
isn't
it
the
same
standard?
i
was
just
listening
to
the
answer
and
i
agree
that
in
anderson
v.
creighton
it
isn't,
but
in
anderson
v.
creighton
the
underlying
constitutional
standard
is
what
society
thinks
is
reasonable,
basically.
here
the
underlying
constitutional
standard
is
what
an
officer
thinks
is
reasonable
and
since
it's
what
a
reasonable
officer
thinks
is
excessive,
they
become
the
same
standard.
that's
just
a
coincidence,
but
it
happens
to
be
so.
that
is,
i
don't
see
how...
think
of
an
example.
can
you
think
of
a
single
example
in
which
you're
prepared
to
say
it
is
excessive
force.
it
is
excessive
force,
i.e.,
an
officer,
a
reasonable
officer
would
have
known
it
is
excessive
because
otherwise
it
isn't
excessive
force.
and
you're
prepared
to
say
it
is
excessive
force,
but
you'd
also
say
he
has
qualified
immunity,
i.e.,
a
reasonable
officer
couldn't
have
been
expected
to
know
it
was
excessive.
that's
logically
impossible.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
so
give
me
an
example
as
a
test,
as
a
test.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
unreasonable,
i.e.,
an
officer,
an
officer
they
are
saying,
a
police
officer,
should
have
know
that
that
force
was
excessive.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i
didn't
understand
the
substantive
test.
i
thought
the
substantive
test
for
excessive
was
it
is
excessive
only
if
a
reasonable
officer
would
have
known
it
was
too
much
force.
i
thought
that
was
the
substantive
test.
so
what
is
the
substantive
test,
if
that
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
a
reasonable
officer,
if
a
reasonable
officer,
looking
at
the
situation
would
have
thought
it
was
not
unreasonable,
then
is
it
excessive?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question
because
i'm
trying
slowly
to
write
down
what
you
think
the
steps
are
and
what
i
have
written
down
is
i
have
three
basic
steps
for
a
judge
in
an
appellate
court
hearing
this,
say
as
it
was
or
before
the
trial
or
a
trial
judge.
step
one
is,
judge
take
the
facts
as
the
plaintiff
asserts
them
insofar
as
they
survive
summary
judgment.
step
two
is,
ask
the
following
question,
should...
in
light
of
preexisting
rule,
should
a
reasonable
officer
have
believed
there
was
too
much
force,
in
light
of
preexisting
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
is
there
a
difference
between
what
you
just
said
and
what
i
just
said?
now
listen
to
what
i'm
saying
because
i
want
to
understand
the
difference.
i'm
saying
that
the
qualified
immunity
question
in
this
context
is,
in
light
of
present
law,
should
a
reasonable
officer
have
thought
there
was
too
much
force?
now
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
good.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
i'm
trying
to
write
down.
i
only
have
one
more
step.
so
we
have
the
right,
we
know
what
to
do
with
the
facts,
we
know
what
the
qualified
immunity
question
is,
at
least
my
statement
of
that
was
all
right.
and
then
i
go
on
to
say,
by
the
way,
if
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
a
reasonable
officer
should
have
believed
there
was
too
much
force,
then
the
third
step
is
direct
a
verdict
for
the
plaintiff
unless
the
underlying
facts
are
in
dispute.
and
if
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no,
then
direct
the
verdict
for
the
defendant.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
he
wins
even
if
the
facts
are
in
dispute
if
the
answer's
no,
because
we've
assumed
the
plaintiff's
facts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
now
i've
proposed
the
right
three
steps.
now
that's...
i'm
asking...
i'm
just
trying
to
walk
it
through
and
maybe
you
don't
want
to
answer
because
i
understand
it's
very
complicated
and
you
may
have
had
a
different
way
of
looking
at
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
looked
at
it
as
well
and
i
think
we're
only
talking
about
the
person
on
the
left,
mr.
saucier,
who
didn't
even
push
him.
it
was
the
one
on
the
right,
i
think
officer
parker,
who
gave
him
a
little
push.
so,
is
that
right?
have
i
looked
at
the
right
person?
i
mean,
we
all
i
guess
have
the
same
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes
i
agree,
but
i
didn't
see
any
force
at
all
used
by
mr.
saucier.
saucier...
it
was
the
one
on
the
right
who
seemed
to
give
him
a
little
push,
but
the
one
on
the
left
didn't
seem
to
do
anything.
he
just
stood
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
he
probably
was
talking
about
parker
giving
him
a
little
push,
but
is
there
anything
else
you
want
to
say?
i
mean,
if
i
were
to
look
at
the
record
and
just
the
picture
of
the
police
officer
on
the
left,
did
i
not
see
something?
maybe
i
missed
something
or
what
is
it
i
missed
that
he
did?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
also
i
assume
they
are
very
good
judges.
oh,
there
a
lot
of
good
judges
can
disagree
about
things.
i
go
back
to
the
standard,
if
it's
all
right,
for
one
minute.
i
might
have
thought
that
the
ninth
circuit
used
the
right
standard
even
though
maybe
it
didn't
apply
it
correctly,
but
for
the
one
example
that's
been
raised,
which
is
the
hog-tie
case.
and
in
thinking
about
that,
i
thought,
well,
maybe
that's
an
instance
where
suddenly
the
underlying
substantive
rule,
which
i
previously
thought
turns
100
percent
on
whether
the
policemen
in
the
field
would
reasonably
have
thought
this
was
too
much
force
or
not
is
suddenly
changed.
that
is,
if
you're
going
to
have
a
set
of
practices
that
define
the
reasonableness
of
it,
i.e.,
hog
tying,
diminished
capacity,
is
by
law
excessive
force,
then
we
do
have
anderson/creighton,
then
we
do
have
the
fourth
amendment
search
and
seizure
and
then
the
standards
do
diverge.
now
without
the
hog
tie,
if
we
just
have
first
standard,
they
don't
diverge.
now
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
right
then
you
say
anderson...
anderson
doesn't...
it's
not
so
that
anderson
doesn't
apply.
anderson
applies
double.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
first
thing
you
ask
is
the
anderson
test
and
if
the
answer
to
that
question
is
the
plaintiff
flunks,
he's
not
only
flunked
the
qualified
immunity
test,
he's
also
flunked
the
substantive
test.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
if
the
standards
are
the
same,
sometimes
by
coincidence
it
could
turn
out
that
the
qualified
immunity
standard
and
the
underlying
substantive
standard
are
the
same.
and
if
so,
there's
only
one
question
to
ask
and
if
not
there
are
obviously
two
questions
to
ask.
all
right,
i
thought
all
they're
arguing
is
that
this
and
the
ninth
circuit
says
by
coincidence
they
happen
to
be
the
same.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
the
part
you're
disagreeing
with?
you're
saying
they're
not
the
same.
