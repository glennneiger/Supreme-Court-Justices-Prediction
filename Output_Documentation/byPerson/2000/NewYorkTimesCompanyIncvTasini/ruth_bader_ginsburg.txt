this
case
concerns
the
rights
accorded
freelance
authors
and
a
privilege
accorded
their
publishers
under
seciton
201(c)
of
the
copyright
act
of
1976.
the
plaintiff’s
six
freelancers
contributed
articles
to
three
print
publications,
two
newspapers,
the
new
york
times
and
newsday
and
one
magazine,
sports
illustrated.
without
the
author’s
permission,
the
print
publishers
authorized
lexis/nexis
to
place
the
author’s
articles
into
the
nexis
database.
the
times
also
authorized
university
microfilms
international
to
place
times
articles
into
the
new
york
times
ondisc
and
general
periodicals
ondisc.
the
three
databases
have
several
common
features,
each
contains
articles
from
sequential
editions
of
periodicals
spanning
many
years.
in
each,
the
user
may
search
for
articles
based
on
criteria
such
as
author,
subject
or
headline.
the
user
may
view,
print
or
download
each
article
yielded
by
the
search,
each
story
appears
to
the
user
separately
clear
of
the
context
provided
by
other
items
originally
published
in
the
same
edition.
the
freelance
authors
complained
that
their
copyrights
in
their
individual
works
were
infringed
when
the
defendant
electronic
publishers
as
licensed
by
the
defendant
print
publishers,
distributed
the
author’s
articles
to
the
databases.
in
response
the
publishers
asserted
that
their
actions
were
shielded
by
section
201(c)
of
the
copyright
act,
the
meaning
of
that
provision
is
“key
to
this
case”.
the
section
leaves
author
and
publishers
free
to
negotiate
whatever
arrangement
they
will,
in
default
of
private
ordering,
section
201(c)
declares
that
the
freelancer
retains,
the
copyrights
in
her
contribution
to
a
collective
work
like
a
magazine
or
newspaper.
the
publisher
in
the
words
of
the
statute
is
presumed
to
have
acquired
only
the
privilege
of
reproducing
and
distributing
the
contribution,
as
part
of
that
particular
collected
work,
any
revision
of
that
collective
work,
and
a
later
collective
work
in
the
same
series.
the
us
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
publishers.
in
that
court’s
view,
the
databases
copied
to
freelancers
articles
as
part
of
a
revision
of
the
original
periodical
edition
and
so
qualified
for
the
section
201(c)
privilege.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
reversed
ordering
entry
of
judgment
for
the
authors.
in
the
court
of
appeals'
view,
massive
databases
loaded
with
multitudes
of
individually
retrievable
articles
are
not
revisions
of
particular
newspaper
or
magazine
editions.
but
we
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
construed
section
201(c)
and
we
therefore
affirmed
its
judgment.
the
1976
copyright
act,
aimed
to
improve
the
situation
of
freelance
authors
vis-à-vis
their
publishers.
to
that
end
section
201(c)
assures
that
if
there
is
a
demand
for
a
freelance
article,
either
standing
alone
or
when
a
new
collection,
the
freelancer
can
benefit
from
that
demand
after
authorizing
initial
publication,
the
freelancer
can
sell
the
article
to
others.
the
crucial
statutory
term
of
section
201(c),
relevant
here,
allows
the
publisher
to
reprint
the
article
as
part
of
a
revision
of
the
original
collective
work.
like
the
second
circuit,
we
cannot
see
how
the
databases
perceptively
copy
articles
as
part
of
a
revision
of
a
particular
edition
of
a
newspaper
or
magazine.
one
might
view
the
articles
as
part
of
a
new
compendium,
the
entirety
of
works
in
the
database.
but
the
massive
database
no
more
constitutes
a
"revision"
of
each
constituent
edition
than
a
400-page
novel
quoting
a
solid
in
passing
would
constitute
"revision"
of
that
poem.
alternatively,
one
could
view
the
articles
in
the
databases
as
part
of
no
larger
work
at
all,
but
simply
as
individual
articles
presented
individually.
but
201(c)
does
not
authorize
the
publisher
to
copy
individual
articles
discretely.
the
publisher’s
privilege
is
in
the
collective
work
only,
the
edition
as
a
whole.
the
publishers
have
warned
that
a
ruling
for
the
authors
will
decimate
the
electronic
record
of
history,
but
today’s
decision
means
only
that
the
publishers
have
infringed
the
author's
copyrights
and
must
provide
appropriate
regrets.
the
opinion
does
not
necessitate
a
court
order
barring
inclusion
of
the
freelancer’s
articles
in
the
databases.
speculation
about
the
publisher’s
response
to
our
ruling
moreover,
provides
no
cause
for
this
court
to
shrink
rights,
congress
safeguarded
to
authors
under
section
201(c).
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
