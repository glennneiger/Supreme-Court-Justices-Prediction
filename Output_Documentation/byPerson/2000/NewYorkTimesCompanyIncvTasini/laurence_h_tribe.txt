mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
parties
on
both
courts
below
agree
on
at
least
two
things,
first,
that
section
201(c)
represents
a
compromise
that
assures
freelance
authors
that
they
may
control
and
exploit
their
individual
contributions
to
collective
works
like
newspapers
and
magazines
in
new
anthologies
and
serializations
and
screenplays
and
other
derivative
works
unless
they've
expressly
transferred
that
right.
the
parties
are
also
agreed
as
are
both
courts
below
that
201(c)
assures
the
publication
of
collective
works
that
the
publisher
of
such
collective
works
has
the
aggregate
right
to
publish
any
article
in
the
collective
work
both
in
publishing
the
collective
work
itself
of
course,
but
also
in
publishing
that
article,
quote,
as
part
of
any
revision
of
that
collective
work,
again
unless
there
has
been
an
express
transfer
of
the
right.
now
the
principal
impetus
for
this
measure
was
a
rather
strong
wish
to
undo
several
quite
notorious
rulings
like
that
of
the
southern
district
of
new
york
in
the
geisel
case
in
1968
which
of
course
involved
the
legendary
dr.
seuss
and
denied
him
the
right
to
stop
the
unauthorized
distribution
of
toy
dolls
that
were
derived
from
cartoons
that
he
had
published
decades
earlier.
there
is
no
hint
at
all
in
the
history
of
this
measure
and
i
think
no
hint
in
the
way
it's
written
that
microfilm,
for
example,
which
had
been
in
use
for
some
40
years
at
the
time
this
measure
was
passed
and
which
people
used
to
make
copies
of
individual
articles
more
often
than
to
make
copies
of
entire
cumbersome
periodicals
was
seen
by
anyone
as
a
problem
to
be
addressed
or
solved
by
201(c).
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
ultimate
end
user.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
as
do
we,
justice
scalia,
in
nexis
and
in
the
cd-roms,
the
entire
text
with
the
exception
of
certain
graphics
that
cannot
be
handled
by
ascii
is
put
in.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right
and
in
this
case
you
basically
conduct
a
search
under
the
algorithms
that
are
used
by
nexis,
conduct
a
search
of
the
entire
periodical
whether
you
call
for
a
particular
topic--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well
it's
in
virtual...
it's
in...
it's
certainly
not...
it's
not
a
newspaper
that
we're
used
to.
you
can't
drink
your
coffee
to
it
or
wrap
your
fish
in
it
but
that
really
is
a
red
herring,
if
i
may
say
so.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
at
any
one
time,
but
with
a
very
simple
prompt
of
about
15
characters
you
can
get
the
entire
periodical.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
you
certainly
can.
that's
why
we're--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes,
and
for
decades--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--sometimes.
what's
happened,
justice
o'connor,
it
appears
that
for
at
least
20
years
people
have
assumed
because
no
one
complained
of
this
practice
that
the
standard
contract
was
not
limited
to
the
print
medium.
now
as
of
1995,
for
example,
the
new
york
times
made
clear
they
would
not
make
contracts
with
people
for
print
only.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right.
on
the
basis
of
a
display
argument
that
is
disclaimed
by
the
tasini
respondents
that
wasn't
made
below
and
that
doesn't
make
sense
under
the
statute,
because
quite
clearly
if
we
are
involved
in
reproduction
and
distribution
display
is
covered
in
the
intersection
of
those.
it's
not,
i
think,
a
serious
argument.
you
notice
the
solicitor
general
did
not
decide
to
come
into
this
case.
but
you're
right
about
the
register
of
copyright.
however
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it's
an
interesting
theory,
justice
ginsberg,
but
i've
tried
to
imagine
how
by
carving
this
pie
into
two
pieces
one
could
give
the
older,
the
other,
more
muscle.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
in
1995,
i
was
saying
a
minute
ago,
the
new
york
times
said
we're
not
going
to
run
articles
print
only.
it
would
be
kind
of
pointless
now
when
almost
everything
has
to
go
onto
the
internet
or
be
preserved
in
some
other
way
other
than
print
and
they
said
that
our
contract
will
automatically
cover
print
and
electronic
rights.
and
what's
interesting
is
that
the
royalties
didn't
change
a
cent
after
that.
i
think
it's
a
kind
of
belief
in
magic
that
leads
some
people
to
think
that
if
there's
an
inequity
of
bargaining
power
it
will
be
solved
by
creating
two
estates
rather
than
one.
in
fact,
in
the
mid
1980s
it's
interesting
that
the
respondents
went
to
congress,
the
national
writers
union
went
to
congress
and
tried
to
get
a
measure
much
more
modest
than
this
one,
a
measure
that
would
say
that
when
there
is
a
demonstrable
inequity
in
bargaining
power,
an
unconscionable
arrangement,
and
when
that's
shown
by
individualized
proof
there
could
be
a
transfer
of
rights.
here
they
want
a
wholesale,
global
transfer
which
i
don't
think
is
necessarily
going
to
change
anything
for
the
future
but
could
have
very
serious
impact
on
existing
writings
whose
authors
and
heirs
and
assigns
are
going
to
be
extremely
difficult
to
locate.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right
and
all
i'm
saying
is
there
is
not
any
particular
reason
to
think
the
deals
will
come
out
very
differently.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
think,
justice
scalia,
that
they
think
quite
rightly
that
they
can
get
a
lot
of
money
to
settle
a
case
in
which,
if
we
were
to
lose,
we
and
many
other
publishers
around
the
country
would
have
no
choice
but
to
engage
in
defensive
deletions
of
a
lot
of
material
that
could
otherwise
expose
us
to
massive
statutory
damages
under
the
copyright
laws.
that's
why
a
number
of
pulitzer
prize
winning
historians
have
said
they're
afraid
of
what
it
will
do
to
their
research.
that's
why
the
american
library
association
which
is
an
amicus
on
their
side
has
conceded
that
it's
awfully
difficult
to
find
these
people
and
there
may
be
an
adverse
impact.
even
the
register
of
copyright
in
the
letter
to
which
you
referred,
justice
o'connor
said
there
may
be
an
impact
on
scholarship
and
research.
and
i
think
that's
an
understatement.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
don't
know
that
that
will
help
a
lot,
justice
ginsburg
and
the
reason
is
that
keeping
something
on
nexis
or
in
cd-roms
that
you
have
in
circulation
after
it
has
been
determined
to
be
infringing
and
letting
people
potentially
have
access
to
it,
which
the
download
might
be
an
infringement,
would
be
a
new
act.
so
i
don't
think
the
statute
of
limitations
will
solve
the
problem.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
that's
the
irony,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
the
erasures
of
a
lot
of
these
things
will
not
be
in
the
interest
of
the
people
whose
work
may
be
erased
but
someone
who
wrote
an
article
in
1980
and
maybe
was
60
years
old
at
the
time
and
maybe
isn't
around
at
the
moment,
there
are
a
lot
of
people
like
that.
we
don't
know
how
many.
we
don't
know
how
many
articles,
but
the
u.s.
news
and
world
report
has
already
decided
in
anticipation
because
there's
no...
they
think
no
analytic
difference
between
microfilm
and
some
of
these
products,
certainly
the
gpo
cd-rom
which
is
a
photographic
copy
is
not
different,
they've
stopped
putting
their
work
on
microfilm.
the
line
drawing
problem
here,
if
i
may
say,
is
one
of
several
reasons
why
recalibrating
the
balance
that
congress
struck
is
a
particularly
inappropriate
job
for
the
court.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
certainly.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well
under--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--you
would
think
that,
but
under
504
damages
are
not
measured
by
the
harm
to
the
person
who
sues.
there
is
a
provision
that
says
that
they
can
take
the...
get
the
benefit
of
the
presumption
that
all
of
our
gross
income
was
attributable
to
their
contribution
and
the
theory
of
that
would
i
suppose
be
that
they
don't
need
a
theory
because
the
statute
says
it,
but
the
theory
would
be
that
all
of
the
work
we
put
in
electronic
form
would
not
have
been
worth
anything
if
it
looked
like
swiss
cheese
with
stuff
missing.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it's
rebuttable.
but
they
can
also
elect
statutory
damages
which
can
go
up
to
$30,000
a
violation
and
some
courts
accept
the
nimmer
theory
of
multiple
violations
per
infringement.
it
would
be
more
even,
if
not,
it
could
be--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
it's
more
if
it's
willful.
but
there
is
a
statutory
provision
in
any
event
and
it
would
become
willful.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
it's
a
sliding
scale,
justice
scalia,
and
i
think
there
is
discretion
to
set
it.
and
it
can
be
very
low,
i
think
as
low
as
$250
and
as
high
as
over
10,000,
but
i
have
to
say
i
don't
remember
for
sure.
but
the
point
is
there
are
something
like
100,000
freelance
articles
just
on
nexis.
there
are
18,000
journals
on
nexis.
you
don't
have
to
multiply
100,000
or
50,000
or
20,000
by
a
very
large
number
to
know
that
a
good
business
judgment
for
a
lot
of
these
companies
is
going
to
be
who
wants
the
litigation,
and
you
couldn't
put
together
class
actions
to
solve
the
problem
easily,
given
amchem
and
ortiz
because
of
the
incredible
variability
of
the
contracts
of
the...
some
of
them,
for
example,
will
have
registered
the
copyright
in
the
article
within
three
years
of
its
publication
and
then
be
eligible
for
statutory
damages,
others
won't.
they'll
be
plaintiff-specific
defenses,
statutes
of
limitations
and
laches.
you
mentioned
the
statute
of
limitations,
justice
ginsburg.
it
seems
to
me
that
of
course
that
is
not
a
reason
to
read
the
statute
incorrectly
but
i
think--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that
moves
beyond
revision.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
assure
you,
justice
breyer,
i'd
love
to
know
at
least
as
much
as
you
would
and
i
hope
mr.
gold
will
enlighten
us,
because--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--justice
breyer,
the
record
is
completely
unambiguous
that
nothing
like
that
happens.
what
happens
is
that
the
computer
text
itself,
the
very
same
computer
text
that
goes
to
the
printing
office
so
that
the
new
york
times
then
arrives
at
your
front
desk.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well
the
post,
that's
fine.
i'll
take
the
washington
post,
washington
post,
washington
star,
we
can
pick
our
paper.
the
washington
post,
they
all
follow
the
same
protocol.
there
is
a
computer
text
and
that
text
is
ascii
readable.
that
means
it
can
be
put
in
computer
form
and
one
version...
one
copy,
it's
not
even
a
version,
the
identical
thing
goes
to
the
printing
facility
and--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes
absolute...
the
identification
code--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--if
you
ask
for
the
washington
post.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
wanted
to
first
describe
what
happens
when
it
gets
there
and
then
i'll
try
to
say
what
happens
at
the
other
end
when
someone--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--what
is
sent
is
computer
data,
whole
washington
post
and
it's
put
before
it
goes
there
they
add
advertisements
and
some
other
graphics.
and
then
it
goes
to
the
assembly
room
and
then
it's
delivered
and
put
on
newsstands.
that
edition
of
the
ads
and
the
graphics
which
are
not
ascii--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that
edition
is
not
made
in
the
version
that
goes
to
nexis.
nexis
processes
that
unitary
computer
data.
it
goes
instantaneously,
not
in
driblets,
and
it
doesn't
go
article
by
article.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
there's
not
a
shred
of
evidence,
not
a
whisper
that
suggest
that
they're
first
disassembling
the
paper
into
articles
and
then
whisking
it
over.
it
is
true
that
the
computer
text
registers
each
article
and
identifies
it
just
as
it
identifies
pages
and
there
is
a
file
for
each
article.
but
a
file
is
really
a
conceptual
thing
here.
it's
not
that
they
have
a
little
file
and
they
have
the
article
stuffed
in
it.
and
the
result
of
all
this
is
that
the
technology
shouldn't
obscure
what's
happening.
what's
happening
is
that
something
that
is
as
close
to
the
washington
post
for
that
day
as
it
could
be
given
this
medium
appears
in
the
nexis
computer.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
justice
o'connor.
what
happens
is--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
of
course
not.
although
some
people
want
the
whole
newspaper
and
you
can
get
it
by
saying
date,
paren,
3/28/2001.
but
let
me
answer
your
question--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--nexis
doesn't
strip
out
the
ads.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
ads
are
just
not
added.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
first
of
all,
you
get
the
whole
thing
in
the
gpo
cd-rom.
secondly,
nexis
doesn't
subtract
the
ads,
they're
just
not
added
by
the
washington
post,
although
i'm
not
sure
that
that
matters.
third--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
right.
that's
why
this
is
a
revision.
we're
not
claiming
it's
the
same
thing
but
it
is
awfully
close
and
if
this
isn't
a
revision,
it's
hard
to
know
what
would
be.
the
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
with...
once
the
computer
has
all
of
the
digital
information,
it
indexes
it
according
to
key
words
and
among
those
words
are
the
date
and
an
author
and
the
data
is
sort
of
scattered
to
the
magnetic--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--there
are
several
important
differences,
justice
souter.
one,
the
search
inside
nexis
is
always
of
whole
periodicals,
and
that's
undisputed,
two--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
understand
justice
souter
but
it
is
undisputed
that
the
way
they
do
it,
it's
more
efficient,
is
that
they
will
take
the
intersection
of
all
of
the
indices
you
want
and
they
will
search
the
entire
periodical
by
periodical
to
find
the
article.
they
don't...
it's
not
after
all
a
thinking
machine.
it's
a
dumb
operation,
but
more
important,
you're
not
charged
for
the
article
the
way
you
would
be
at
a
copy
service.
you're
charged
for
search
time
and
that's
the
time
for
searching
entire
periodicals.
also--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--when
you
get
it,
you
get
it
as
part
of
the
revision
and
that's--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
understand
justice
souter,
but
if
you'll
permit
me,
let
me
say
why
i
nonetheless
think
you're
getting
it
as
part
of
the
revised
periodical,
and
the
reason
is
this,
it's
very
important,
so
please
let
me
stress
it.
if
it
were
the
case
that
the
only
way
you
could
comply
with
201(c)
was
that
when
you
asked
for
an
article
you
get,
whether
you
want
it
or
not,
the
whole
periodical
in
which
the
article
appears,
that
would
satisfy
the
concern
you're
expressing.
but
if
that
was
the
only
way
you
could
do
it,
the
statute
would
be
incoherent
because
it
says
that
you
may
reproduce
and
distribute
the
contribution
as
part
of
a
revision
or
you
may
distribute
the
revision
itself
or
a
later
element
in
the
series,
and
if
it
were
the
case
that
you
have
to
get
the
whole
thing,
then
we
would
have
erased
from
the
statute
the
key
compromised
words--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
but
wouldn't
that
be
for
congress,
justice
souter?
that
is,
congress
said--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--but
justice
souter,
to
say
that
it
reads
that
protection
out
of
the
statute
is
hard
to
square
with
the
fact
that
these
authors
in
undisputed
testimony
themselves
said
that
when
they
tried
to
syndicate
their
work
or
serialize
it
or
sell
it
in
some
way
there
was
never
any
evidence
that
its
appearance
in
this
archival
context
on
nexis
or
the
cd-roms
ever
made
the
slightest
difference.
they
can
fully
exploit
their
individual
work,
the
argument
is
that
we
should
be
able
since
congress
said
so
to
reproduce
and
distribute
not
just
a
revision
of
the
composite
work,
but
the
article
as
part
of
that
revision,
and
that
cannot
mean--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no.
no,
justice
ginsberg,
it's
when
you
bind
the
book
and
put
it
on
a
library
shelf
you
could
say
it's
part
of
a
huge
book.
the
fact
is
that
this
is
a
huge
database
and
the
second
circuit's
suggestion
that
we
are
treating
that
whole
database
as
the
revision
is
completely
wrong.
we've
said
all
along
that
the
revision
is
simply
the
digitized
version
of
the
periodical.
that
digitized
version
is
one
that
contains--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
the
nature
of
the
medium.
nothing
exist
separately.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
justice
scalia,
congress
was
well
aware...
they
talked
about
disks,
they
talked
about
any
medium,
they
talked
about
machines
having
to
read
the
stuff,
they
knew
about
the
computer,
1978
wasn't
that
long
ago.
this
law
was
written
to
make
sense
in
the
computer
context.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
the
statute
allows--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no.
the
problem
in
the
world
we'd
have,
justice
scalia,
is
the
world
doesn't
want
only...
and
congress--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think
we're
paying
for
the
existing
royalty
and
secondly,
congress
said
that
we
could
publish
as
part
of
that
compromise
that
we
could
publish
the
individual
article
as
part
of
the
revision.
i'm
saying
that
carries
this
implication
and
it
doesn't
destroy
their
copyright.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
probably
not.
probably
not,
because
i
think--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it
differs
in
a
lot
of
ways.
we
are
sending
over
the
entire
periodical
and
people
can
find--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--would
they
be
charged
for
the
articles
or
charged
for
the
time
it
takes
to
search
the
whole
library.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
it
makes
an
important
difference.
these
things
are
also...
if
you
look
at
the
promotional
materials
they're
promoted
as
complete
periodicals,
hundreds
of
volumes
of
the
most
widely-read
periodicals.
i
think
i
should
reserve
the
balance
of--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
first
say
very
clearly
it
is
not
the
case
that
these
newspapers
disaggregate
something
and
break
it
down
to
facilitate
copyright
violation.
it
is
disaggregated
from
the
word
go,
that
is,
when
they
put
together
the
computer
text
file
that's
going
to
go
to
the
printer
they
do
it
article
by
article
because
as
it
happens,
that's
what
goes
into
a
newspaper.
that
exact
text,
and
you'll
see
it
unmistakably
in
the
record,
is
exactly
what
is
sent.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
sometimes
indexing
codes,
but
not
only
for
articles.
you've
got
to
be
able
to
find
this
stuff.
you
can't
just
wander
around
inside
a
computer.
and
it
is
the
readers
guide
to
periodicals.
that's
what
we've
got
here.
whether
it
is
in
written
form
or
in
index
form,
it's
the
same
thing.
so
point
one,
they
don't
deliberately
disaggregate.
point
two,
if
you
look
at
349
a
of
the
joint
appendix,
that's
one
of
many
places,
i
just
happened
to
find
this
one,
where
they
say
they're
not
claiming
any
contributory
or
vicarious
liability
with
respect
to
infringements
by
end
users.
their
whole
theory
was
putting
this
stuff
in
the
way
that
the
20th
and
21st
centuries
has
to
do
it
is
an
infringement.
it's
really
a
quite
luddite
theory.
their
distinction
with
microfilm
is
that
microfilm
is
a
piece
of
something,
you
can
see
it.
well,
what
about
the
cd-rom,
then?
you
can't
see
it
except
with
a
machine.
it
just
looks
like
it
might
be
joan
baez
singing,
but
it
turns
out
it's
got
volume
upon
volume
of
material.
there's
nothing
fancy
that's
done
here
to
facilitate
violation.
what
they're
doing
is
making
entire
bunch
of
material
available
and
i
didn't
hear
an
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question.
if
we
read
the
law
the
way
they
propose
to
read
it
and
i
still
don't
know
the
exact
moment
they
think
is
an
infringement
and
how
analytically
it
differs
from
justice
stevens'
library
example,
we're
going
to
have
a
serious
problem
with
our
kids
doing
homework
and
with
professors
of
history
finding
out
what
happened
in
the
middle
of
the
20th
century.
it
seems
to
me
that
before
this
court
takes
a
step
like
that
it
should
pause.
