unknown
speaker
when
you
say
people
used
to
make
copies
you
mean
the
ultimate
user?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
person
who
produced
the
microfilm
or
the
microfiche
produced
the
entire
work.
it
produced
the
article
as
part
of
the
entire
work,
not
to
be
shown.
when
a
person
went
to
the
machine
he
would
only
look
to
the
article
that
he
was
interested
in.
unknown
speaker
when
you
would
look
at
a
newspaper
on
microfilm
you
would
get
the
whole
page.
you
would
probably
want
to
single
out
a
particular
article
but
it
was
the
whole
page
that
appeared
to
you.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
not
all
in
one
piece,
is
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
suppose
that
it
has
removed
the
photographs
and
the
ads.
it's
been
disaggregated
and
what
you
see
are
the
individual
articles
from
a
particular--
unknown
speaker
--but
at
least
in
let's
talk
about
the
nexis
for
a
minute.
you
don't
see
ads
and
the
photographs
and
all
that.
but
you
can
pull
out
an
entire
article
that
had
appeared
in
the
times.
unknown
speaker
now,
i
assume
that
the
publisher
can
enter
a
contract
with
an
independent
author
to
cover
the
subsequent
use
in
database
material
and--
unknown
speaker
--probably
the
publisher
does
that
today--
unknown
speaker
--i
notice,
though,
that
the
head
of
the
copyright
division
has
at
least
written
a
letter
that
looks
like
she
thinks
the
court
below
was
absolutely
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
tribe,
does
that
view
of
the
register
of
copyright
relate
at
all
to
one
effort
that
was
made
in
the
76
act
and
to
give
the
independent
artisan,
the
artist,
the
author
more
muscle
vis-a-vis
the
publisher
or
the
patron
than
before?
unknown
speaker
one
could
pay
that's--
unknown
speaker
--so
far
as
the
future
is
concerned,
mr.
tribe,
we're
just
talking
about
money,
aren't
we.
i
mean
the
people
can
negotiate
one
way
or
the
other,
however--
unknown
speaker
--but
at
least
people
evidently
think
it
will.
they're
expending
a
fair
amount
of
money.
unknown
speaker
well,
for
one
thing,
this
is
a
three
year
statute
of
limitations
which
will--
unknown
speaker
--it's
hard
for
me
to
see
that
that's
going
to
be
the
effect
in
the
real
world
because
after
all
these
authors
have
an
interest
in
exposure,
it's
just
like
a
lot
of
people
now
no
longer
have
to
be
artists
for
hire
are
that
anyway,
because
they
will
give
the
copyright
to
the
patron,
they
want
people
to
get
to
know
who
they
are.
unknown
speaker
mr.
tribe,
can
i
pursue
this
damages
question.
i
mean,
as
far
as
ripping
out
everything
that's
on
the
systems
already,
that
certainly
need
not
be
done
by
court
decree.
unknown
speaker
a
court
can
say,
you
know,
taking
equity
into
account
we're
not
going
to
issue
such
an
injunction
so
the
question
would
be
your
clients
would
be
compelled
to
erase
all
of
this
stuff
because
of
the
damages
they
would
have
to
pay.
what
would
the
damages
be
if,
as
you
say,
it
was
worthless.
unknown
speaker
if
it
was
worthless,
the
damages
would
be
negligeable.
unknown
speaker
rebuttable
or
irrebuttable?
unknown
speaker
the
statutory
violation
applies
only
to
willful
violations.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
nonwillful
amount?
unknown
speaker
i
think
if
we
go
back
to
that
for
just
one
second,
because
i'd
like
to
go
about
to
where
justice
o'connor,
i
think,
started.
the
part
that
i'm
having
difficulty
understanding
and
i
don't
actually
understand
this
is
what
precisely,
precisely
say
in
the
case
of
nexis
was
the
event
that
you
think
the
other
side
is
saying
changed
the
work
from
a
revised
work
to
a
new
work.
in
particular
i'm
thinking,
say,
at
ten
in
the
morning
on
may
11th,
2001,
the
washington
post
has
a
piece
of
paper,
it's
called
the
washington
post.
and
then
in
a
analogous
form
that
piece
of
paper
is
in
its
computer.
and
then
something
happens.
that
is,
there's
a
transfer
of
that
information
over
to
nexis
and
what,
i'd
like
you
to
focus
right
on
that,
because
what
you...
i
want
to
know
what
event
in
that
series
of
events
on
that
morning
we're
talking
about
as
being
the
copying,
the
unlawful
copying.
unknown
speaker
yes,
in
their
view
in
your
opinion.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
well,
then,
let
me
give
you
a
little
bit
further...
imagine
what
it
might
be.
it
might
be
this.
it
might
be
that
there
is
a
person
in
the
washington
post
who
pushes
a
button
called
send,
and
at
that
point
what
is
sent
is
not
the
electronic
and
analog
of
the
washington
post
several
pages,
but
rather
a
few
articles
from
the
post
and
then
a
little
later
in
the
day
a
few
more
are
sent.
and
then
a
little
later
a
few
more
are
sent,
and
when
they
arrive
in
nexis,
they
are
nowhere
stored
in
a
form
that
is
in
any
sense
analogous
to
that
page
or
several
pages
in
the
washington
post,
but
rather
is
in
a
large
computer
where
they
are
mixed
with
hunting
fishing
journal
and
everything
else.
unknown
speaker
--example
is
the
post.
unknown
speaker
with
an
identification
code
for
this
day's
edition
of
the
washington
post.
is
that
the
identification
code?
unknown
speaker
so
that
when
you
pull
it
up
what
you
get
is
the
whole
washington
post.
unknown
speaker
ah,
you
have
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
ask
for...
have
it
recompiled.
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
know
what's
sent.
unknown
speaker
forget
about
the
ads
and
the
graphics.
unknown
speaker
so
i
could
look
to
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
to
find
that
because
it
might
very
technically
turn
on
whether
the
transmission
to
nexis
is
the
transmission
at
one
instant
of
time
of
the
electronic
analog,
and
i
chose
the
post
purposely
because
it's
not
involved
in
some
other
aspects
of
the
case,
the...
it
might
turn
on
whether
that
whole
electronic
analog
of
the
entire
paper
is
transmitted
instantly
at
one
instance
over
to
nexis
where
later
on
they
use
electronic
scissors
and
cut
it
up
or
whether
article
by
article
at
different
times
it's
transmitted
so
that
there
is
no
cutting
up.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
tribe,
despite
how
it
is
transmitted,
if
the
whole
thing
goes
immediately,
then
at
nexis
is
it
disaggregated
and
stored
in
a
way
that
one
finds
as
individual
articles.
unknown
speaker
that's
odd,
because
when
i've
used
something
like
that
i've
gone
to
an
author's
name
or
a
subject
matter
and
tried
to
retrieve
an
individual
article,
not
the
whole
newspaper.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
nexis
at
least
strips
out
the
ads,
strips
out
the
graphics
and
the
photos.
unknown
speaker
well,
somebody
is
doing
it
because
what
you
get--
unknown
speaker
--what
you
get
is
the
article.
unknown
speaker
they're
not
added
but
they
are
in
the
original
version.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
the
point,
mr.
tribe,
at
which
there
is
no
longer
any
functional
difference
between
the
way
nexis
stores
and
the
nexis
subscriber
calls
up
on
the
one
hand
and
simply
a
freestanding
reprint
of
the
article
which
anybody
can
walk
into
a
store
and
buy
on
the
other
hand.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean.
if
i
want
an
article
by
smith,
i
understand
that
i
can
search
for
an
article
by
smith
not
for
the
entire
new
york
times
or
washington
post
in
which
smith's
article
occurred.
unknown
speaker
okay.
and
if
i
want
to
get
the
article
cheap
i
identify
the
article
very
specifically
so
that
the
search
time
will
be
less
rather
than
more
and
the
functional
effect
is
that
i
buy
the
article.
unknown
speaker
well,
no,
but
i
don't.
if
i
get...
maybe
you're
telling
me
something
in
fact
that
i
shouldn't
dispute,
but
if
i
want
smith's
article,
what
comes
out
of
the
machine
is
smith's
article
not
the
entire
edition
of
the
post.
unknown
speaker
i
will
accept
that
but
it
may
then
simply
be
that
the
price
of
coherence,
as
you
put
it,
is
a
limitation
on
the
right
of
the
periodical
or
of
the
collection
and
a
corresponding
recognition
of
the
right
of
the
author.
that
may
be
what
coherence
demands.
unknown
speaker
if
that
is
a
necessary...
if
that
is
the
only
way
to
avoid
for
practical
purposes
reading
the
author's
copyright
protection
right
out
of
the
statute
then
i
would
suppose
that's
what
congress
necessarily
has
provided.
unknown
speaker
well,
because
you
played...
the
idea
is
you
played
their
song
beyond
their
permission.
tell
me,
mr.
tribe,
why
if
it
is
wrong
to
think
of
what's
going
on
here
if
you
put
it
in
very
simple
terms
as
taking
the
article
that
the
post
has
received,
to
put
it
in
the
post,
and
just
putting
it
in
a
much,
much
larger
journal?
when
you
give
it
to
nexis,
isn't
that
what
happens?
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
exist...
that
does
not
exist
separately,
it
does
not
exist
by
itself,
it's
part
of
this
big
mass
of
data.
unknown
speaker
you're
inventing
a
revision
that
has
no
real
world
existence.
you're
saying
there's
just
this
part
of
the
data
which
is
scattered
all
through
i
don't
know
how
they
scatter
on
the
disk
or
wherever--
unknown
speaker
--it
would
have
been
thoroughly
feasible,
would
it
not,
to
send
over
the
washington
post
with
identification
that
would
only
refer
to
this
edition
of
the
washington
post.
unknown
speaker
in
which
case
you
would
have
no
problem
in
the
world,
you
have
sent
over
the
washington
post.
unknown
speaker
that
may
well
be
so
pay
for
it
then.
that
just
proves
that
it's
better
to
do
it
the
way
you're
doing
it,
commercially
better,
but
that
doesn't
prove
you
should
have
to
pay
for
it.
unknown
speaker
suppose
you
had
an
old
fogy
editor
who
didn't
want
to
use
any
of
new-fangled
stuff
so
what
he
does
is
he
cuts
out
each
article
in
a
magazine,
each
separate
article
and
he
sends
it
over
to
some
separate
library,
he
sends
over
the
whole
thing
but
it's
sent
over
article
by
article
and
it
is
and
knowingly
to
be...
to
be
indexed
in
that
library
that
he's
sending
it
to
by
the
article,
rather
than
by
the
washington
post
of
the
day,
would
you
say
that
somehow
this
is
just
a
revision?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
why
this
is
any
difference
in
substance.
unknown
speaker
my
case,
too.
the
whole
thing's
sent
over,
but
it's
sent
over
article
by
article
and
it
is
indexed
by
the
article,
in
a
whole
mass
of
articles
from
every
magazine
in
the
country,
now
would
that
be
okay
if
it
was
done
in
print?
i
don't
see
why--
unknown
speaker
--oh,
you
think
that's
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
tribe.
mr.
gold,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
suppose
that
the
times
published
bound
volumes
of
its
paper
but
it
had
an
index
in
the
front
of
it,
maybe
it
does,
with
all
of
the
authors
names
and
all
of
the
subjects
names
and
the
other
thing
it
did
was
it
had
tabs
so
that
you
could
easily
find
the
index.
i
take
it
that
would
be
a
permitted
revision
just
because
it's
in
paper.
unknown
speaker
well,
at
some
point
it
changes
so
much
that
it's
not--
--what
you're
saying--
--electronically
that's
all
this
is,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
take
justice
kennedy's
precise
example,
it's
not
just
the
indexed
new
york
times
of
this
date
but
the
times
publishes
a
massive
volumes,
all
of
the
new
york
times
from
1950
to
1990
with
an
index
in
it,
would
you
consider
that
just
a
revision
of
the
one
edition
of
the
new
york
times
for
which
the
times
had
the
copyright.
unknown
speaker
i
wouldn't
think
that
either.
unknown
speaker
it
also
could
be
a
later
collective
work
in
the
same
series.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gold,
it
would
help
me
if
you
would
identify
for
me
precisely
when
the
infringement
occurs.
let
me
just
take
the
very
first
step.
supposing
the
new
york
times
sends
an
e-mail
to
nexis
and
attaches
an
exhibit
and
on
that
exhibit
is
an
entire
copy
of
all
the
stories
in
the
paper
that
day.
is
that
an
infringement?
unknown
speaker
and
the
reason
it
would
not
be
an
infringement
is
because
translating
it
from
the
paper
media
to
the
electronic
media
would
be
a
revision?
is
that
correct?
just
as
though
you
put
it
in
braille,
that
would
be
a
revision.
unknown
speaker
so
that
step
isn't
an
infringement.
now
when
does
the
infringement
occur
and
by
whom?
unknown
speaker
let's
take
the
first
one
and
by
whom.
unknown
speaker
and
then
you're
going
to
have
to
tell
me,
why
is
that
different
from
putting
a
photostat
or
a
microfiche
of
a
new
york
times
in
a
particular
place
in
a
big
library?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you're
putting
a
revision
in.
unknown
speaker
what
you
just
said
was
a
revision.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
your
complaint
alleges
contributory
infringement
by
the
new
york
times
the
minute
it
sends
it
to
me,
data
central.
i
thought
that
was
the
allegation
in
your
complaint,
that
that's
a
contributory
infringement
because
the
new
york
times
knows
what
they're
going
to
do
with
it,
they're
going
to
disaggregate
it
and
have
it
available.
is
that
the
allegation
or
not?
unknown
speaker
that's
how
i
read
it.
unknown
speaker
but
that...
even
if
they--
--the
other
side
disputes
that.
mr.
tribe
says
that's
not
it.
we
send
exactly
what
we
had,
but
be
that
as
it
may.
is
it
not
your
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
whatever
the
new
york
times
sends
is
a
contributor
infringement?
unknown
speaker
okay,
now
if
that
is
so,
why
should
it
make
a
difference
whether
the
times
sends
it
in
an
arguably
aggregated
form
or
an
arguably
disaggregated
form,
isn't
the
real
point
from
your...
from
the
standpoint
of
your
case
that
the
newspaper
is
participating
in
a
process
the
end
point
of
which
is
disaggregation
and
access
to
disaggregated
materials.
unknown
speaker
and
if
that's
the
case
then
why
isn't
it
on
your
theory
an
infringement,
no
matter
what
the
format
in
which
the
times
or
any
newspaper
sends
the
material
to
nexis?
unknown
speaker
then
i
should
think
your
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question
would
be
the
infringement
on
the
part
of
the
newspaper
takes
place
at
the
moment
of
transmission.
unknown
speaker
i'm
still
not
clear
of
your
answer
of
justice
stevens'
question,
when
does
the
first
infringement
take
place?
it
sounds
as
if
you're
saying
the
infringement
takes
place
when
the
times
pushes
the
button
to
remove
all
the
ads
and
the
graphics
or
when
the
times
pushes
the
button
to
enable
a
searcher
to
pull
up
the
article
by
author
and
that
seems
very
strange
to
me.
when
is
the
first
act
of
infringement?
forget
about
contribution
to
the
tort,
when
is
the
first
infringing
act?
unknown
speaker
there's
a
tortfeasor
and
persons
who
contribute
to
the
tort.
when
is
the
tort
first
committed?
the
tort
of
infringement.
unknown
speaker
when
can
i
say,
ah-ha,
there's
an
infringement.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
but
why,
since
the
newspaper
knows
that
that
is
what
is
supposed
to
happen,
that
in
fact
is
what
it
called
for
in
its
contract
with
nexis,
why
doesn't
the
newspaper
infringe
at
the
moment
when
it
takes
the
first
step
in
that
process,
which
i
suppose
would
be
the
moment
at
which
it
presses
the
send
button
to
send
the
material
to
nexis?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
going
to
ask
that,
i'm
asking
the
opposite.
that
is,
what
is
the
process,
and
the
reason
i
find
it
important
is
it
seems
to
me
possible
from
what
your
opponents
have
said
that
what
happens
at
say
the
post
or
the
times
is
there
is
the
analog
electronically
of
the
front
page.
it
doesn't
have
the
pictures,
it
doesn't
have
the
graphs.
i
don't
care
about
that
for
the
moment.
assume
you
lose
on
that
one.
i
have
the
electronic
analog
which
is
close
enough.
and
then
what
happens
is
somebody
pushes
the
send
button
and
at
one
instance
of
time
that
electronically
is
transmitted
to
nexis
where
it's
on
a
chip.
now
all
that
happens
after
that,
where
we
have
the
electronic
analog
on
a
chip,
is
some
electronic
signals
are
added
by
nexis
to
parts
of
the
chip
so
that
any
user
of
nexis
who
wants
to
can
call
it
up
like
any
other
thing,
article
by
article.
now
i
want
to
know
is,
is
that
what
happens?
unknown
speaker
creating
an
article
file
maybe
that
on
a
chip
there's
the
electronic
analog
or
on
a
disk
and
you
add
a
few
other
signals.
unknown
speaker
now
the
reason
i'm
asking
this
and
the
reason
i
think
it's
important
is
because
it
seems
to
me
it
might
make
an
enormous
difference
if
the
only
infringing
act
is
when
a
user
comes
in
and
calls
up
a
file,
because
at
that
point
principles
of
fair
use
come
into
play,
and
i
think
principles
of
fair
use
might
make
an
enormous
difference
to
the
end
result
and
the
reason
to
get
my
whole
question
out
because
i
might
not
have
another
opportunity
is
i
am
disturbed
very
much
by
what
i
call,
by
way
of
parody,
their
chinese
cultural
revolution
argument.
that
is,
we
wipe
out
the
history
of
the
20th
century
and
that's
an
overstatement
but
it's
not
such
an
overstatement
when
you
think
that
most
school
children
today
will
be
looking
for
information
on
machines
and
if
it
isn't
in
the
database
library
d.h.
lawrence,
john
p.
marguand
or
lesser
figures
will
simply
disappear
because
it's
too
expensive
for
them
to
locate
each
heir
and
to
get
the
copyright
permission
to
put
the
article
on
the
machine.
all
right,
i've
got
it
all
out
now
i'd
like
your
response.
unknown
speaker
i'd
like
you
to
take
as
long
as
you'd
like
and
i
won't
interrupt
further.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gold,
if
you've
had
a
chance
to
finish
your
answer,
why
is
that
different
from
sending
a
newspaper
to
a
library
with
very
detailed
indexes,
knowing
that
the
library
will
allow
people
to
come
in
and
make
individual
copies
of
individual
stories,
individual
contributions
to
it.
unknown
speaker
has
a
very
elaborate
index
system
and
it's
part
of
a
huge
library.
unknown
speaker
all
it
does
is
provide
the
information
that
enables
the
person
to
pick
and
choose
what
he
wants.
unknown
speaker
and
has
a
xerox
machine
where
the
guy
can
go
in
and
get
the
particular
one
he
wants.
unknown
speaker
so
just
to
be
sure
i
understand,
the
infringement
occurs,
i
still
want
to
know
just
when
it
first...
the
infringement
occurs
when
the
individual
makes
a
selection
and
then
makes
a
copy
of
his
particular
choice.
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
the
same
in
the
electronic
situation?
there's
no
infringement
and
some
individual
picks
out
a
particular
article
that
was
both
part
of
a
revision
and
part
of
original
copyright
by
the
author
and
makes
a
copy
of
that
without
making
a
copy
of
the
whole
revision.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
earlier
that
if
the
whole
e-mail
was
copied
in
electronic
form
that
would
be
a
revision,
not
an
infringement.
are
you
changing
your
view
on
the--
unknown
speaker
--correct.
unknown
speaker
selling
individual
articles,
yeah,
right.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
first
one
before
that.
unknown
speaker
is
that
analytically
different
from
creating
elaborate
indices
in
a
print
library.
unknown
speaker
well,
its
equivalent
in
the
print
media,
i
guess,
would
be
sending
over
a
package
of
separate
articles
which
in
combination
were
the
washington
post
of
that
day,
but
they're
sent
over
as
separate
articles
and
each
one
indexed
in
such
a
way
as
to
facilitate
the
obtaining
of
those
articles
without
obtaining
the
rest
of
the
washington
post.
unknown
speaker
that's
not
what
my
understanding
of
the
record
is,
they
sell
it...
send
it
over
as
a
bundle.
they
don't
send
it
over
in
separate
pieces.
that's
what
i
wanted
to
know.
unknown
speaker
well,
all
right,
but
suppose
it's
the
exact
electronic
analog
of
the
morning
paper.
i
mean,
if
it's
the
exact
electronic
analog
of
the
morning
paper
that
they
send
over,
i
know
it's
technical
but
this
is
a
pretty
technical
case
and
then
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
not
just
sending
separate
articles.
if
they
send
one
at
ten
in
the
morning
and
another
at
four
in
the
afternoon
it
might
be
quite
different.
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
establish
that
they
are
sent
over
as
separate
articles.
what
constitutes
the
sending
over
of
them
as
separate
articles?
i
thought
it
was
the
fact
that
when
they're
sent
over
they
are
coded
and
identified--
unknown
speaker
--separately,
not
as
simply
one
unidentifiable
part
of
the
washington
post
of
may
2nd.
unknown
speaker
each
one
has
a
code
on
it
which
enables
it
to
be
treated
as
a
separate
article.
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
quite
useless
for
the
purposes
for
which
they
want
it.
they
don't
want
the
washington
post
of
may
2nd.
they
want
the
ability
to
get
individual
articles.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gold,
before
you
finish
i
would
like
you
to
respond
to
mr.
tribe's
point
that
on
your
theory
the
microfiche,
it
would
be
the
same
thing,
equally
infringing.
unknown
speaker
why
not.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
a
problem
that
with
computers
we
can...
you
can
simultaneously
be
a
bundle
and
a
whole
bunch
of
separate
things,
depends
on
which
button
we
decide
to
push
whether
you
want
the
whole
thing
or
just
one.
unknown
speaker
thank
you
mr.
gold.
mr.
tribe
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
no
additional
code
on
it?
unknown
speaker
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
00-201,
new
york
times
company
versus
tasini,
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
