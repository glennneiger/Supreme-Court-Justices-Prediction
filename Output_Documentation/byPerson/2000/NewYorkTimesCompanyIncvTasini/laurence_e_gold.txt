mr.
laurence
e.
gold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
addressing
the
part
of
the
discussion
that
just
concluded,
section
201(c)
and
its
cognate
sections
103
and
the
definition
sections
as
has
been
discussed
distinguished
between
the
author's
copyright
in
his
individual
contributed
work,
which
he
retains
when
he
contributes
it
to
a
collective
work,
and
the
collective
work
copyright
owners,
this
language
couldn't
be
more
cumbersome,
mainly
the
publishers'
copyright
in
the
collective
work
as
a
whole.
the
statute
couldn't
be
clearer,
we
believe,
in
the
proposition
that
the
collective
works
copyright
owner
has
no
copyright
in
the
individual
article
in
these
free-lance
situations
where
there
is
the
separate
author
copyright.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
clearest
lesson
from
that
is
that
if
the
publisher
were
in
print
terms
to
publish
reprints
of
individual
articles
and
treat
them
separately
that
would
be
an
infringing
action,
the
publisher
would
be
exploiting
the
article
as
an
article
and
without
any
authorization.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
if
in
paper
terms,
the
times
were
to
publish
a
version
of
what
they
electronically
provide
to
nexis,
article
by
article,
by
the
way
in
file...
each
article
in
a
file.
but
if
they
were
to
publish
that
as
a
coherent
whole,
the
reader's
condensed
may
1st
new
york
times,
i
think
there's
a
very
strong
argument
that
that's
a
revised
version
of
the
paper.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i'm
saying
that
is
a
fair
argument
but
we're
miles
away
from
that
fair
argument.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
do
not
think
that's--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--a
revision.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
the
question
here,
though,
at
least
there
is
an
argument
that
that's
a
revision
and
not
an
exploitation
of
the
copyrighted
author's
article
as
an
article,
but
my
point,
my
beginning
point
is
that
as
i
understand
mr.
tribe's
argument,
if
the
times
were
to
publish
an
article
as
an
article,
saying
this
was
part
of
the
new
york
times
and
offer
it
on
the
market,
make
copies
and
offer
it
to
anyone
who
wants
to
buy
it,
that
that
would
be
part
of
the
publisher's
201(c)
right.
at
that
point
there's
nothing,
on
that
theory,
there
is
nothing
left
of
the
fact
that
the
author
is
the
copyright
holder
in
the
article.
we
thought
that
was
the
starting
point,
that
the
one
thing
that
is
plain
is
that
the
collective
work
copyright
holder
cannot
exploit
the
article
as
an
article,
as
a
separate
freestanding
work.
and
in
the
end
what
the
nexis
system
does
is
exploit
articles
on
an
article
by
article
basis.
they're
drawn
from
hundreds
of
collective
works.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
don't
think
that
if
you
take
a
particular
view
of
what
the
revised
work
is
at
that
stage
whether
there
is
an
infringement
seems
to
me
questionable,
but--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--as
long
as
a
collective
work,
but
what
is
done
here--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--the...
it
seems
to
us
there
are
a
series
of
infringements,
the
first
is--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--the
first
is
that
the
articles
are
coded,
the
article
files
are
coded
and
then
inserted
into
an
overall
database
of
millions
and
from
the
latest
numbers,
billions--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--because
you're
not
putting
a
microfiche
of
the
new
york
times
as
a
new
york
times
what
you're--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--no.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
no,
you're
putting
articles
that
were
part
of
the
revision
into
an
undifferentiated
mess
and
in
that
sense
you're
creating
a
quite
different
work.
those
articles--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--that's
the
allegation.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
but
my
point
was
that
it
by
putting...
they're
not
sending
an
integrated
new
york
times
to
nexis,
they're
sending
disaggregated
articles
which
will
be
further
disaggregated.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
my
only
point
in
making...
in
stating
that
the
form
of
the
transmission,
namely
in
article
files,
is
that
is
part
and
parcel
of
what
you've
just
stated,
namely
an
overall
process,
to
create
a
set
of
disaggregated
article
files.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
think
that
in
those
terms
that's
true
and
i
thought
i
did
answer
it
that
way
in
the...
in
the
sense
that
it
is
the
nature
of
the...
the
nature
of
the
disaggregation
and
assigning
each
article
to
an
article
file
which
is
part
and
parcel
of
this
overall--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--when
you
say
forget
about
contributing
to,
i'm
just
not
clear
on
what
you're
asking.
the--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--this
is,
i
guess,
as
i
see
it
an
act
that
is
the
first
step
in
a
continuing
process
of
infringement.
the
times--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--it
seems
to
me
that
in
practical
terms
the
first
act
of
infringement
of
any
substance
is
the
putting
of
the
article
files
as
separate
article
files
on
the
nexis
database
and
making
it
available
in
this
system
to
be
accessed,
printed
out,
downloaded
and
so--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--i
don't
think
i've
ever
before
been
faced
with
an
embarrassment
of
riches
where
i'm
being
asked
to
say
how
many
multiple--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--my
understanding
of
what
happens
is
that
the
post
creates
a
set
of
article
files,
each
of
which
are
an
electronic--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--do
i
get
one
sentence
or
two?
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
first
of
all
the...
it
is
enormously
different,
i
would
suggest,
to
breakdown
and
disaggregate
a
collective
and
into
component
parts
when
the
component
parts
are
the
copyright
property
of
someone
else
and
to
take
the
first
and
necessary
step
for
those
component
parts
to
be
exploited
as
individual
freestanding
works
and
with
the
purpose
of...
providing
that
they
will
be
exploited
as
freestanding
works.
the...
every
step
from
the
first
step
taken
by
the
newspapers
and
breaking
this
down
into
article
files
coding
it,
providing
those
article
files
to
nexis
where
they
are
further
coded
and
inputted,
not
necessarily
in
sequence,
is
to
create
a
system
in
which
the
article
files
can
be
exploited
as
individual
files,
as
individual
articles.
this
process
is
the
print
equivalent
process
of
printing
each
article
as
an
individual
article
which
can
be
combined
with
any
other
of
a
billion
articles
in
a
new
compilation
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
original
collective
work
or
any
revised
collective
work
or
published
by
itself,
printed
and
published.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well
if
the
library--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--yeah.
justice
stevens,
all
i
can
say
is
if
the
library
is
part
and
parcel
of
copying
individual
articles,
that's
a
copyright
infringement.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
there
are
two
different
questions
that
it
seems
to
me
you're
raising.
if
the
library
simply
gives
someone
an
index
and
a
copy
of
the
paper
and
says--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--the
question
is
whether
the
library
is
implicated
in
providing
the
duplicating
system.
the
law
could
not
be
clearer
on
that.
there
are
elaborate
provisions
in
the
copyright
act
with
regard
to
library
permitted
or
created
copying
for
a
price
and
don't
forget
this
is
all
commercialized.
nexis
is
not
a
free
service.
it
is
a
publishing
service
creating
new
copies
of
these
works
for--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--you
mean
in
the
library
example
you
are
raising?
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
two
things
if
i
can,
the
copying
of
the
work
onto
the
disk
is
one
kind...
if
we're
correct,
is
one
kind
of
copyright
infringement.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
no,
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand
what
you're
asking.
if
the...
we're
discussing
your
newspaper--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--library
example.
the
only
infringement
is
if
the
library
is
actively
engaged
in
facilitating,
allowing
further--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--duplications
for
a
price.
in
this
case,
there
are
multiple
infringements
before
that
because--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--the
first
one
is
the
preparation
of
the
article
files
as
separate
article
files
for
the
purpose
of
creating
an
overall
compilation
of
separate
article
files
which
are
to
be
exploited
as
separate
article
files.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes,
because
it
is
part
and
parcel
of
a
process
for
printing,
if
you
will,
for
reproducing
and
distributing
separate
article
files,
separate
articles
as
such.
if
the
news...
to
go
back
to--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--right,
for
a
price,
for
sale.
that
is
precisely
what
i--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--they
send
over
a
bundle
of
separate
pieces.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
justice
breyer,
if
to
use
justice
scalia's
example,
you
send
to
the
print
shop
every
separate
article
that
appeared
in
the
newspaper
and
said
print
each
one
up
as
a
separate
article
to
be
purveyed
to
the
public,
given
the
structure
of
this
act,
that
is
different
from
saying
here
is
a
collective
whole,
because--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--right.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
correct.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
right,
and
the
only
togetherness,
if
you
will,
is
that
it's
our
understanding,
and
it
is
my
understanding
of
the
record
that
after
the
paper
is
broken
down
and
these
article
files
are
created
and
coded,
they
are
transmitted
or
streamed
as
a
set
of
distinguishable
article
files
but
they
are
not
a
unit,
an
electronic
unit
of
the
may
1st
paper,
they
are
a
separate--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--correct.
this
is
a
purpose
of
commercial
activity.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
we
don't
believe
that
the
microfiche
is
equally
infringing?
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
because
it
is
a
reproduction
of
the
whole
paper
in
integral
form.
now,
if
to
the
extent
that
the
paper
is
shown
rather
than
read,
you
have
the
whole
paper,
you
can
read
what
you
want,
but
it's
a
one
to
one
relationship
between
the
number
of
copies
that
are
made
and
the
number
that
are--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
that's
why
the
fact
that
it
is...
that
the
system
is
one
of
articles
which
can
be
exploited
as
articles
or
in
any
combination
of
articles
makes
all
the
difference.
it
is
not
a
set
in
any
real
terms
of
the
works.
