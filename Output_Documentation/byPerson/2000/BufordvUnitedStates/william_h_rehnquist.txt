we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
99-9073,
paula
buford
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
strang.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
strang,
isn't
there
one,
perhaps,
factor
that
cuts
against
your
argument
the
fact
that
district
courts
probably
see
this
kind
of
case...
kind
of
an
argument
in
connection
with
sentencing,
a
typical
district
judge,
much
more
often
than
a
typical
judge
of
a
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
where
the
federal
judge
sits,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
milwaukee
county?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
why
is
it
peculiarly
suited
to
de
novo
review,
mr.
strang?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
uniformity
more
important
with
respect
to
this
guideline
than
any
other?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
uniformity
is
important
with
respect
to
this
particular
guideline.
you're
saying
uniformity
is
important
with
respect
to
every
single
aspect
of
the
guidelines?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that
more
important
than,
say,
the
clarity
of
the
rule
with
respect
to,
say,
acceptance
of
responsibility?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
strang.
mr.
wolfson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
wolfson.
mr.
strang,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
strang.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-9073,
buford
against
united
states
will
be
announced
by
the
justice
breyer.
