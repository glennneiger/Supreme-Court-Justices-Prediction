suppose,
as
in
justice
ginsburg's
example,
a
district
court
said
there
is
no
consolidation,
in
my
view,
unless
there's
a
formal
order
of
consolidation.
that's
it.
that
seems
to
me
a
general
proposition,
a
general
and
very
broad
interpretation
of
the
text,
which
is
susceptible
of
de
novo
review
and
which
ought
not
to
vary
from
one
court
to
another.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he
didn't
do
that
here.
he
was
a
very
careful
judge.
he
did
say,
i'm
left
to
conclude
the
only
inference
of
consolidation
is
the
fact
that
the
sentences
were
imposed
in
two
different
cases.
that's
almost
a
negative
formulation
of
the
hypothetical
rule
i
gave
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
understand
that
the
necessity
for
allocating
resources
of
the
courts
at
the
different
levels
in
the
right
way,
but
it
seems
to
me
if
you
had
a
twin
case
to
this
that
it
should
have
come
out
a
different
way.
i
just
don't
see
what
discretionary
findings,
what
deference
that
ought
to
be
given
to
the
trial
judge
in
this
very
case.
i'm
not
saying
that
other
consolidation
cases
there
wouldn't
be
some
factors,
say
if
the
judge,
the
federal
sentencing
judge
said,
well
now,
these
state
judges
i'm
sure
must
have
balanced
the
two
sentences
and
that
makes
them
related.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
under
your
view
the
trial
courts
will
not
have
any
guidance
from
the
appellate
system
even
as
to
what
factors
ought
to
be
considered
in
whether
there
was
consolidation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
thinking
in
the
context
of
this
case,
where
we're
pretty
well
agreed
on
what
happened,
the
two
attorneys
and
the
two
different
offenses
but
the
one
hearing.
