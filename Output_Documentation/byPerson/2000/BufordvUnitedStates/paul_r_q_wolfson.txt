mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
properly
applied
a
deferential
standard
of
review
to
the
district
court's
decision
for
two
principal
reasons.
first,
the
text
of
the
sentencing
reform
act
itself
directs
the
courts
of
appeals
to
give
due
deference
to
the
district
court's
applications
of
the
guidelines
to
the
facts
and,
second,
institutional
considerations
also
support
a
deferential
standard
of
review.
the
district
courts
are
better
suited
for
making
the
kind
of
fact
intensive
decision
that
is
typically
involved
in
applying
the
guidelines
to
a
set
of
facts.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
justice
kennedy,
i
think
i
agree
with
you.
that
is,
if
the
district
court
said,
i
interpret
the
guideline
to
mean
that
in
no
case
may
i
conclude
that
two
prior
cases
were
consolidated
unless
there
were
a
formal
order
of
consolidation,
and
then
that's
the
rule
of
law,
and
then
i
apply
the
rule
of
law
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
authorized
to
review
that
rule
of
law
in
a
plenary
fashion.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
if
he
announces
that
as
a
generally
applicable
rule
of
law
that's...
that
is,
it
doesn't
matter
what
any
other
fact
of
the
case
is,
that
is
the
rule
of
law
that
applies
in
every
case
of
this
nature
that
will
come
before
me,
that
is
a
rule
of
law.
but
if
he...
but
if,
on
the
other
hand,
what
he
is
doing
is
saying,
i
read
what
the
court...
i
read
the
standard
that
has
been
enunciated
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
that
is,
there
may
be
such
a
thing
as
functional
consolidation,
and
now
i'm
going
to
determine
whether
the
disparate
facts
of
this
case
answer
to
that
description,
and
i
see
there
are
15
salient
facts
in
this
case
and
eight
of
them
tip
in
one
direction
but
seven
in
another,
and
on
balance
i
conclude
that
it's
not
functionally
consolidated,
that
is--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
he
said
a
lot...
actually,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
he
said--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--he
said
more
than
that.
i
mean,
i'm...
i
would
point
the
court
to
page
21
of
the
joint
appendix
which,
without
belaboring
it
too
long,
he
also
did
go
on
to
say
there
were
guilty...
there
were
separate
guilty
pleas
entered,
there
were
two
separate
judges,
you
know,
he
found
there
was
no
agreement
among
the
parties
that
the
cases
would
be
consolidated,
so
i
think
really
what
he
was
doing
was
answering
to
the
other
description
that
i
was
discussing
which
he
was
saying,
here's
how
i
think
the
facts
of
this
case
ought
to
be
classified
according
to
a
legal
standard,
and
that
is
the
application
of
the
guidelines
to
the
facts,
which
congress--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
it's
best
viewed
that
way,
your
honor,
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law.
that
is,
consolidation
is...
can
be
understood
as
a
legal
concept
and
functional
consolidation.
it's
similar
to
the
common...
i
think
more
clearly
a
mixed
question
of
fact
than
law
is
the
common
scheme
or
plan
idea.
if
anything,
this
perhaps
seems
a
little
more
factual.
i
think
the
common
scheme
or
plan
notion
of
relatedness
is
one
that
comes
up
very
frequently,
and
that
is,
i
agree,
is
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law
and,
like
this
case,
if
the
court
were
to
apply
that
application
note
to
a
set
of
facts,
that
should
be
reviewed
deferentially
on
appeal,
and
it's
very--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--justice
kennedy,
i
think
what
the
district
court
was
doing
in
this
case
was
saying,
when
i'm
asked
to
consider
whether
something
is
functionally
consolidated,
i'm
really
considering
did
the
previous
state
court
system
treat
the
two
cases
as
though
they
were
one?
now,
there's
no
order
specifically
saying
that
they
did,
so
i
have
to
look
at
the
record
of
what
happened
in
those
two
cases
and
see
how
the
court
system
treated
this
case.
now,
there
isn't
a,
kind
of
an
immediately
obvious
answer,
so
the
court
had
to
look
at
the
way
that
those
cases
were
treated
from
the
complaint
stage
all
the
way
until
the
sentencing,
and
there
were
various
factors
that
strongly
indicated
that
the
two
cases
were
not
consolidated.
they
were
charged
by
separate
complaint.
they
were
assigned
to
two
judges.
one
of
the
judges
said,
i'm
not
going
to
wait
for
sentencing
in
the
other
judge...
in
the
other
case,
it's
too
long,
i'm
going
to
go
full
steam
ahead
on
this
case.
so
i
think
the
evaluation,
the
district
court's
determination
that
the
totality
of
the
facts
have
a
certain
character
is
what
we
view
as
the
application
of
the
guideline
to
the
facts,
and
that
is
what
is
entitled
to
deference.
now,
on
the
institutional
consideration
point,
i
don't
think
there's
any
reason
to
think
that
that
task
would
be
done
better
if
repeated
by
three
appellate
judges,
or
at
least
that
that
task
isn't...
doesn't...
that
that
function
isn't
worth
the
cost
to
the
justice
system
as
a
whole.
after
all,
although
it's
true
that
the
judge
did
not
make
credibility
determinations
in
a
classic
sense,
he
was
required
to
draw
inferences
from
a
historical
record
to
sort
of
fill
in
the
gaps,
try
to
figure
out
why
the
court
system
treated
this
case
one
way
rather
than
another,
and
that
is
a
very
fact
intensive
determination,
and
i
also
think
there's
not
any
particular
reason
to
believe
that
an
agglomeration
of
appellate
case
law
in
this
subject
would
prove
particularly
useful
for
this--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--yes--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
the
sentencing
commission,
of
course,
does
review
every
district
court
sentencing.
now,
when
one--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--but
of
course...
well,
of
course,
that's
true
of
many
aspects
of
the
administration
of
the
sentencing
system.
that
is--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--it's
true
of
permissible
bases
for
departure.
it's
true
of...
i
mean,
other...
there
are
other
sentencing
guidelines
applications
that
are
of
very
similar
character,
whether
somebody
is
a
minimal
participant
in
an
offense,
whether
his
crime
involved
more
than
minimal
planning--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--it
may
not
be
entirely
clear
whether
a
case
was
functionally
consolidated,
and
it
may
not--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--and
it
may
not
be
clear
whether
a
case...
it
may
not
be
clear
whether
a
case
involved
a
common
scheme
or
plan.
courts
can
reach
whether
defendant's
prior
offenses
involved
a
common
scheme
or
plan.
courts
can
permissibly
reach
different
conclusions
about
a
set
of
facts
on
that
case.
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that,
you
know,
if
a
district
court
on
review
of
a
court
of
appeals,
say
it
were
de
novo,
were
to
say
well,
this
case
is
plainly
functionally
consolidated,
or
this
case
is
functionally
consolidated
because
this
defendant's
two
prior
offenses
in
wisconsin
state
court
were
consolidated,
i
don't
think
that
helps
the
district
court
decide
any
later
case
say
well,
this
defendant's
alabama
offenses
were...
were
functionally
consolidated.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
we
have
argued
in
some
lower
courts,
your
honor,
that
consolidation
means
formal
order
of
consolidation,
but
the
seventh
circuit
has
ruled
otherwise.
several
other
courts
of
appeals
have
ruled
otherwise.
we
haven't
asked
those
courts
to
reconsider
that
rule
of
law.
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
reexamine
this.
we
accept
the
concept
for
this
case
that
there
is...
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
functional
consolidation,
and
the
more
important
question
to
us
is
how
that
concept,
as
with
many...
as
with
the
application
of
many
concepts
in
the
sentencing
guidelines,
how
that
concept
is
applied
and
how
that
application
should
be
reviewed.
it's
a
more
important
issue
to
us
in
terms
of
the
overall
administration
of
the
guidelines
system,
and--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
the
other
things
that
could
have
made
it
more
clearly
consolidated
would
have
been,
one
plea
bargain
would
have
been
a
very,
a
very
important
factor
had
that
been
in
the
other
direction,
one
district
attorney
who
was
there
to
represent
the
interests
of
the
state
in
both
cases,
and
not
two
district
attorneys
where
one
specifically--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--abjured
any
interest
in
the
other
case.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
you
could,
but
i
mean...
but
i
think--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--and
although
there
were
concurrent
sentencing
the
judge
understood
the
sentences
to
be
different
sentences.
that
is,
they
were
not...
they
were
not
entered
in
one
sentencing
order.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
if
they
had
been
determined
pursuant
to
a
single
plea
bargain,
justice
stevens--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
one
could
reach
a
more...
a
better
conclusion
that
they
were
consolidated,
because
it
indicates
that
the...
you
know,
that
the
executive
branch
was
treating
them
as
though
they
were
inextricably
connected,
but
that's...
that
was
not
what
happened
in
this
case.
it
was
really
a
happenstance
that
they
were
sentenced
on
the
same
day
and
it
might
well
have
been
that
they
were
not.
after
all,
judge
geske
said,
i'm
not
going
to
wait
for
the
entry
of
the
plea
in
the
other
case,
i'm
going
to
go
ahead
with
sentencing
in
my
case,
and
that,
i
think,
is
a
strong
factor
that
points
in
the
opposite
direction.
now,
of
course,
to
go
back
to
the
standard
of
appellate
review
point,
i
think
there
isn't
any
particular
reason
to
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
de
novo
review
would
necessarily
arrive
at
a
better
result,
or
a
more...
as
a
systemic
matter
more
accurate
result
of
these
determinations,
because
the
facts
are
so
disparate.
there's
also
the
point
that
surely
when
the
state
court
is
deciding
whether
to
consolidate
cases,
as
the
wisconsin
state
court
said,
or
whether
it's
not,
it's
not
thinking,
well,
in
some
possible
future
federal
prosecution--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
that's
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
yes,
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
i
think
that's
right,
that
it's
a
federal
term.
i
would
ordinarily
expect
that
if
the
state
court
entered
a
formal
order
of
consolidation
under
its
criminal
rules
that
would
be
enough,
absent
some
extraordinarily
unusual
facts,
but
even
so,
i
mean,
surely...
i
mean,
as
the
district
court,
as
the
district
judge
pointed
out
in
this
case,
you
know,
he
did
look
at
the
record
in
the
state
court.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
of
course--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
mean,
the
petitioner
has
not...
the
petitioner
has
only
argued
that
de
novo
review
should
be
applied,
and
the
petitioner
has
not
argued
that
if
a
deferential
standard
of
review
is
applied
that
the
judgment
should
be
reversed,
so
that's...
you
know,
i
mean,
that's
the
case
as
we
take
it.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
i
think
that
cuts...
you
know,
the
fact
that
they
could
not
have
been
put
together
for
trial
may
cut
in
our
direction.
that
is--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
i
think
he
could
have.
i'm
not
sure
that
the...
i'm
hesitant
to
rely
too
heavily
on
that,
because
i'm
not
sure
that
the
wisconsin
court
rules
forbid,
flatly
forbid
consolidation
for
trial,
but
they
certainly
presume
that
a
drug
case
and
a
nondrug
case
will
not...
will
proceed
along
separate
tracks,
and
i
think
that
this,
as
the
seventh
circuit
pointed
out,
you
know,
that
is
a
factor
pointing
against
functional
consolidation
in
a
case
like
this,
because
wisconsin
seems
to
have
a
policy
of
not
wanting
such
cases
to
be
tried
together.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
seem
to
be--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--the
prior
bank
robberies?
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
i
don't
think
that's
true
actually,
justice
stevens.
after
all,
although
the,
you
know,
the
facts...
i
don't
think
that
there's
a
showing
that
the...
you
know,
the
bank
robberies
and
the
drug
addiction
were,
you
know,
part
of
a,
as
we
might
say,
part
of
a
scheme
or
part
of
a
modus
operandi.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
that
is
generally
not
enough
for
a
court
to
view
cases
as
related,
or
even
as
part
of
a
common
scheme
or
plan,
i
mean,
you
know,
and
the
district
court
was
quite
clear
on
that
point
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed,
and
the
petitioner
didn't
argue
otherwise,
so
i
mean,
it's
a
more
narrow
concept
than
that
when
one
is
asking
whether
prior
cases
are
related.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
think
that
all
three
subprongs
of
the
relatedness
test...
that
is,
common
scheme
or
plan,
same
occasion,
consolidation,
are
applied...
are
reviewed
under
a
deferential
standard
of
review.
that's
not
to
say
that
there
are
never
any
legal
questions
that
may
be
involved
in
that,
and
those,
as
we
discussed
earlier,
would
be
reviewed
de
novo.
an
example
i
can
think
of
in
this
case
is,
the
guideline
says
that
offenses
are
not
deemed
to
be
related
if
they
were
separated
by
an
intervening
arrest,
and
so
there
you
might
have
to,
you
know,
consider
whether
something
was
a
continuing
crime,
and
the
same
would
be
the
case...
i'm
sorry,
i
meant
with
the
common,
with
the
same
occasion
subprong
you
might
have
to
consider
whether
the
offenses
were...
one
of
the
offenses
was
a
continuing
crime
and
that's
a
legal
question.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
i
think
the
rule
does--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
the
rule
that
we
are
proposing
does
lend
itself
to
a
more
general
applicability,
justice
breyer.
i
mean,
we
have...
section
3742(e)
does
say
that
the
courts
of
appeals
shall
give
due
deference
to
the
district
court's
applications
of
the
guidelines
to
the
facts,
and
that
is
a
system
wide
directive.
it's--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
the
statute
does
say
due
deference,
and
so
it
doesn't
exclude
the
possibility
that
there
will
be
situations
where
de
novo
review
is
appropriate,
as
when
the
district
court
engages
in
a
legal
interpretation
of
a
guideline,
or
where
it
seems
clear
that
that's
what
it
was
doing
in
that
particular
case.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
that's
correct,
but
i
am
thinking
of,
there
are
some
guidelines
where
there
may
be
legal
conclusions
that
the
court
has
to
engage
in.
one
thing...
one
that
has
come
to
mind
is
the
definition
of
aggravated
felony
in
section
2(l),
where
there
are
both
legal
determinations
to
be
made
and
then
applying
those
determinations
to
the
facts,
but
i
think
that
one
can
presume
as
a
general
matter
that
when
the
issue
is
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law,
as
the
court
described
it
in
miller
v.
fenton,
where
it
falls
somewhere
between
a
pristine
legal
standard
and
a
determination
of
the
raw
historical
facts,
i
think
that
as
a
general
matter
where
it
falls
in
that
category
a
deferential
standard
of
review
will
be
appropriate.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
one
has
to
look
at
the,
sort
of
the
system
as
a
whole
and
the
institutional
considerations
and
reach
a
judgment
about
how
congress
intended
the
system
to
operate,
and
i
mean,
certainly
in
koon,
you
know,
the
court
was
aware
that
the
question
of
whether
a
permissible
departure
one
way
or
another
was,
had
enormous
significance
not
just
in
the
facts
of
particular
cases.
it
could
mean
a
tremendous
difference
in
the
defendant's
sentence,
and
yet
the
court
concluded
as
a
general
matter
whether
the
district
court
concluded
that...
when
the
district
court
concluded
that
it
was
or
was
not
a
permissible...
an
appropriate
basis
for
departure,
i
should
say,
on
the
facts
of
the
case
was
to
be
reviewed
deferentially.
now,
that's
not
to
say
that
the
court
couldn't
conclude
that
the
answer
it
reached
was
wrong.
i
mean,
the
court
reached
such
a
conclusion
in
koon,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
don't
think
that's
right,
justice
kennedy.
that
is,
i
think...
i
mean,
deference
is
not
no
review.
that
is,
i
think
a
court
can't...
if
the
district
court
makes
a
clear
error
of
judgment
about
whether
something
was
consolidated
or
was
not
consolidated,
just
as
if
it
makes
a
clear
error
of
judgment
as
to
whether
a
defendant's
prior
offenses
were
part
of
a
common
plan--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
i
mean,
this
case
is...
i
can't
think
in
this
case,
or
a
case
like
this,
of
any
facts,
say,
that
would
have
been
so
out
of
bounds
for
a
district
court
to
consider
that
it...
you
know,
that
it
would
have
been
completely
erroneous
to
have
considered
that
fact,
but
looking
at
the
system
more
generally
and
not
just
consolidated
but
relatedness
and
applications
of
the
guidelines,
i
don't
think
that
one
should
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
due
deference
means
no
review
at
all,
just
as
is
the
case
in
departure
decisions
under,
departure
decisions
under
the
guidelines.
the
courts
of
appeals
can
give
the
district
court
guidance
about
what
is
inappropriate,
an
inappropriate
basis
for
departing
in
that
situation.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
i
think
that...
i
may
not
be
quite
understanding,
but
i
think
that
one
has
to
assume
that
the
courts
of
appeals
announce
interpretations
of
the
guidelines
and
that
the
district
courts
then
apply
those
interpretations
in
a
faithful
manner
to
the
facts
of
cases.
now--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
of
course,
if
the
district
court
had...
i
mean,
assuming
it
hadn't
been
settled
in
the
seventh
circuit,
if
the
district
court
had
said
no
functional
consolidation--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
of
course,
if
the
district
court
had
refined
that
rule
further
and
had
announced
what--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--it
may
be
that
the
functional...
that
de
facto
or
functional
consolidation
is
sufficiently
fluid
that,
you
know,
in
the
ordinary
course
the
district
court's
determination
is
going
to
be
controlling.
i
mean,
it's--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
that's--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
i
think
that's
right,
the
sentencing
commission
is
there
precisely
to
continue
the
process
of
making
the
sentencing
guidelines
more
uniform
by
reviewing
the
experience
of
the
district
court.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
justice
souter,
one
response
i
would
like
to
say
is,
i
think
as
the
commission
and
as
the
courts
refine
the
legal
concepts
farther
and
farther
down,
and
as
the
legal
concepts
themselves
become
narrower,
i
think
it's
going
to
be
the
case
that
the
district
court's
determination
whether
any
case
where
the
facts
of
the
case
fall
within
those
legal
concepts
is
more
likely
to
be
upheld.
that
is,
if
all
we
had
was
two
cases,
or
if
two
cases
are
related--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--that's
correct,
if
it
was
within
the
statutory
limits
there
was
no
review
at
all,
but--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--yes,
but
my
point
is,
it's
harder
to
find,
i
think,
an
abuse
of
discretion
inherently
as
the
legal
rule
that
you're
applying
to
a
set
of
facts
becomes
narrower
and
narrower.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
mean,
as
both
the
sentencing
commission
and
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think
that's
sort
of
inevitable.
now,
the
court
of...
if
all
that
were
available
in
this
case
were
the
bare
guideline
that
said
related,
and
there
were
no
application
notes,
then
as...
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
then
undertaken
the
task
of
refining
that
concept
of
related,
which
is
at
a
more
general
level,
and
then
would
have
applied
it.
thank
you.
