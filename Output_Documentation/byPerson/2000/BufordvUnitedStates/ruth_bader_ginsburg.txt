and
there
was
no
formal
consolidation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it's
possible
the
court
of
appeals
could
say,
this
is
too
complicated,
unless
there's
a
formal
consolidation
we
won't
apply
the
guideline
that
way,
because
that
isn't
even
settled,
is
it,
that
this
notion
of
functional
qualification
doesn't
come
out
of
the
guideline,
doesn't
come
out
of
any
application
note.
it's
something
that
some
courts
made
up.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
there
is
to
be
any
kind
of
uniformity
infused
in
this
process,
why
should
it
come
from
the
court
of
appeals
rather
than
the
sentencing
commission?
i
mean,
you
could
see
common
scheme.
you
could
see
crimes
that
happened
simultaneously.
but
this
notion
of
consolidation,
a
judge
could
consolidate
just
because
the
guy
happened
to
have
committed
a
number
of
crimes
totally
unrelated.
it
doesn't
have
the
coherence
that
the
other
two
categories
have,
so
why
shouldn't
this
be
something
for
the
sentencing
commission
to
straighten
out,
and
then
there
would
be
uniformity,
to
get
the
uniformity
that
way
rather
than
sticking
the
court
of
appeals
into
the
picture?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
clear
rule
for
appellate
courts
that
recognizes
the
expertise
that
district
judges
have
might
say,
i
reject
this
notion
of
functional
consolidation.
either
it's
consolidated
or
it's
not,
and
so
if
it's
consolidated,
formally
consolidated,
that's
one
thing.
if
it's
not
formally
consolidated,
forget
it.
that
would
hardly
benefit
people
in
your
client's
situation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wouldn't
there
be
a
huge
temptation
for
a
court
of
appeals
to
take
that
position,
therefore
to
reduce
the
number
of
cases
that
would
come
to
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wolfson,
by
answering
as
you
did,
you're
sort
of
accepting
this
functional
consolidation
notion.
has
the
government
taken
a
position
in
dealing
with
these...
this
consolidation
notion
of
whether
it
should
be
a
consolidation
order
or,
we're
not
going
to
mess
with
functional
consolidation,
or
has
the
government
just
not
taken
a
position
on
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wolfson,
could
the
district
judge
have
taken
into
account
that
these
cases
were
put
together
for
sentencing
but
that
they
could
not
have
been
put
together
for
trial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
suggesting
that.
