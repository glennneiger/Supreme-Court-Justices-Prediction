mr.
dean
a.
strang
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
paula
buford's
case
presents
the
very
type
of
mixed
question
well-suited
to
de
novo
review,
and
that's
particularly
true
here
because
of
the
overriding,
indeed
the
pervasive
importance
of
uniformity
in
the
current
federal
sentencing
scheme.
paula
buford
serves
a
prison
sentence
roughly
twice
as
long
as
it
would
have
been
because
of
the
way
in
which
the
district
court
interpreted
and
applied
guidelines
and
commentary
on
relatedness
and
consolidation.
in
her
view,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit
erred
by
declining
to
give
independent
review
to
the
question
of
consolidation
incorporated
into
the
meaning
of
relatedness,
specifically
declined
to
review
de
novo
whether
her
prior
convictions,
her
prior
cases
in
fact
had
been
consolidated.
i
think
there
are
several
specific
reasons
that
make
this
an
appropriate
case,
an
appropriate
mixed
question
application
of
the
guidelines--
mr.
dean
a.
strang
--it
is
true,
your...
mr.
chief
justice
that
but
a
fraction
of
sentences
ever
are
appealed
on
any
ground,
but
there
is
no
reason
to
assume
that
the
district
judge
would
be
reviewing
the
act
of
a
state
court
in
his
own
district
or
her
own
district
or
of
any
court
familiar
to
that
district
judge.
the
fact
that
the
prior
convictions
here
arose
in
milwaukee
county,
the
seat
of
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin,
i
think
is
fairly
described
an
accident.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
yes.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
yes,
and
that's
an
accident
of
the
facts
here.
there's
no
reason
that
ms.
buford's
prior
convictions
could
not
have
arisen
in
tuscaloosa,
alabama,
or
san
fernando,
california--
mr.
dean
a.
strang
--never
of
historical
facts,
regardless
which
path
one
takes
to
relatedness.
the
basic,
or
what
this
court
has
called
historical
facts,
would
be
subject
only
to
clear
error
review.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
the
particular
mixed
question
of
consolidation,
which
is
the
third
prong
of
the
definition
here,
yes.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
there
may
well
be
mixed
questions,
and
i
think
the
common
scheme
or
plan
is
the
application
here
that
next
to
consolidation
most
calls
or
most
invites
de
novo
review.
if
we
look
at
the
question
of
an
intervening
arrest,
which
is
the
initial
screening
device
in
the
definition
under
the
application
note,
i
think
that
one
is
most
factual,
that
an
intervening
arrest
rarely,
if
ever,
would
arise
beyond
fact,
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
sir,
i
understand
the
concern.
i
think...
first
let
me
note,
justice
breyer,
that
the
functional
consolidation
term
comes
only
from
the
seventh
circuit
and
some
of
the
other
court
of
appeals,
the
application
on
the
guideline
themselves
refers
simply
to...
well,
the
application
note
refers
simply
to
consolidation.
it
is
a
question
of
what
type
of
guideline
are
we
applying
here,
and
clearly
if
we
confine
ourselves
today
to
the
realm
of
federal
sentencing,
united
states
sentencing
guidelines,
i
would
submit
clearly
that
some
guidelines
never
rise
above
fact
in
their
application.
others
i
think
are
altogether
discretionary
in
their
application.
many
of
the
chapter
5
guidelines
would
fall
into
that
category.
still
others,
including
the
consolidation
question
here,
i
think
are
the
sort
of
mixed
question--
mr.
dean
a.
strang
--i
don't
know
that
your
honor's
understanding
would
be
any
cruder.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
but
the
determination
is
one
that
i
think
peculiarly
is
made
here
on
court
documents...
transcripts,
pleadings,
orders,
at
least
in
the
ordinary
case.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
and--
mr.
dean
a.
strang
--well,
yes,
and
i--
mr.
dean
a.
strang
--i
don't
know
that
it
would,
because
it
really
turns,
i
think,
on
the
guideline
one
is
applying,
and
if
anything
is
true
of
the
scheme
that
the
sentencing
reform
act
established,
it
is
that
an
exercise
of
discretion,
if
that's
what
your
honor
is
describing,
must
be
explained
so
that
it
can
be
assessed
for
reasonableness.
it
is
also,
i
think,
true
here
that
facts
must
be
found,
whether
that's
the
whole
of
the
inquiry
or
whether
that's
simply
the
predicate,
then,
to
applying
the
legal
standard
to
classify
the
facts.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
that
is
exactly
what
i
think
it
means,
and
to
put
it
in
concrete
terms,
i
think
what
it
means
here
is
that
if
paula
buford
had
a
twin,
john,
who
had
done
the
very...
who
had
committed
the
state
court
crimes
in
1992
with
her,
also
the
1998
federal
crime,
but
he
had
been
sentenced
by
the
district
judge
below
judge
stadtmueller
and
had
received
a
7-year
or
84
to
105-month
sentence,
whereas
paula
for
the
exact...
in
the
exact
same
situation
had
received
nearly
16
years,
a
court
of
appeals
giving
clear
error
review
would
be
bound
to
affirm
both
of
those
convictions
and
sentences.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
and
that,
of
course,
implicitly
is
what
this
district
judge
said,
and
the
relevant,
or
the
most
important
pages
are
21--
mr.
dean
a.
strang
--yes,
he
did.
he
took
note
that,
you
know,
the
facts
appeared
undisputed.
he
was
left
to
try
to
apply
the
guideline
and
the...
i
guess
he
called
it
the
applicable
application
notes,
and
then
made
comment
about
there
being
two
separate
prosecutors,
albeit
from
the
same
d.a.'s
office,
pursuing
separate
interests.
there
were
two
separate
pieces
of
paper
entered
reflecting
judgments.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
that
is
true,
there
was
no
formal
order
of
consolidation.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
yes,
in
a
word--
mr.
dean
a.
strang
--the
sentencing
commission
very
well
can,
and
is
empowered
to
address
questions
and
to
try
to
advance
clarity
in
that
way.
that,
of
course,
says
nothing
about
the
question
on
certiorari
granted
here,
which
is
the
standard
of
review,
and
the
sentencing
commission
cannot
tell
this
court
the
standard
of
review.
i
think
also,
if
we're
talking,
then,
about
the
substantive
rule
of--
mr.
dean
a.
strang
--i--
mr.
dean
a.
strang
--i...
in
the
world
of
could,
i
agree
with
much
of
what
your
honor
said.
uniformity
is
advanced
by
de
novo
review
vis-a-vis
deferential
review.
i
mean,
so
as
between
courts
acting
on
the
question,
i
think
the
courts
of
appeals
are
better
situated
to
provide
uniformity.
the
sentencing
commission
could...
is
a
co-actor
here,
there's
no
question,
but
there's
also
no
question
that
congress
did
not
mean
that
the
commission
would
oust
the
federal
courts
of
appellate
jurisdiction,
quite
the
contrary.
this
was
part
of
the
sentencing
reform
act...
it
included
3742...
and
giving
the
appellate
courts
a
much
more
active
role
in
reviewing
sentences
than
ever
they
had
before
in
this--
mr.
dean
a.
strang
--it--
mr.
dean
a.
strang
--again,
the
sentencing
commission
could
act.
it
is
also
clear...
and
this
is
in
the
legislative
history
that
we
cited.
it's
clear
that
congress
had
in
mind
that
appellate
decisions
would
assist
the
sentencing
commission
in
determining
what
it
is
that
needed
clarification
or
revisitation,
so
i
don't
think
it's
an
either
or--
mr.
dean
a.
strang
--situation.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
well,
i
don't
know
that
it
would.
my
problem
is
that
you
are
then
leaving
the
sentencing
commission
to
look
at
the
largely
unreported
work
of
district
judges
in
94
districts,
rather
than
looking
at
the
largely
reported
work
of
appellate
judges
in
12
circuits,
as
i
understand
it,
so
i'm
not
so
sure,
your
honor,
that
de
novo
review
still
isn't
the
better
way
to
interact
with
the
commission.
that
said,
again
i
want
to
make
clear
that
the
commission
has
the
role
that
justice
ginsburg
posits,
and
that
it
is
not
every
guideline
or
application
of
guideline
that
i
suggest
is
appropriate
for
de
novo
review
under
this
court's
teaching.
this
one,
yes,
consolidation
i
think
is
peculiarly
appropriate.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
one,
the
overriding
importance
of
uniformity
here,
which
i
think
elevates
the
need
to
clarify
and
develop.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
oh,
no,
the
guidelines
generally,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
sorry.
the
guidelines
in
general,
the
sentencing
reform
act
of
1984.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
yes,
and
i'm
sorry,
the
confusion
i
created.
i
am
saying
in
a
sense
both.
uniformity
always
here
is
important
in
federal
sentencing,
but
when
we're
talking
about
a
guideline
that
has
a
complex
statutory
standard,
as
this
one,
and
is
not
a
matter
of
purely
individualized
application
such
as
acceptance
of
responsibility,
or
a
decision
whether
to
depart
upward
or
downward
for
some
unconsidered
fact,
then
i
think
uniformity
of
the
rule,
clarity
of
the
rule,
the
meaning
of
the
legal
standard
is
exceptionally
important.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
acceptance
of
responsibility
falls
closer
to
the
realm
of
what
this
court
has
called
supervision
of
litigation.
it
is
dependant
upon
factors
that
cannot
be
transmitted
by
transcript,
or
are
not
available
to
a
court
of
appeals.
the
defendant's
demeanor.
the
manner
in
which
he
interacts
with
counsel.
you
know,
a
variety
of
issues
that
may
appear
only
off
the
record
and
therefore
concern
conduct
immediately
before
the
district
court.
i
think
to
follow
on
my
answer
to
your
honor's
earlier
question,
a
clear
rule
of
decision
i
think
is
important
here
for
consolidation,
because
the
potential
disparity
in
otherwise
like-placed
persons
is
so
great,
as
the
facts
of
this
case
demonstrate.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
that's
exactly
the
path
that
the
first
circuit
now
has
gone,
no
consolidation
unless
there's
a
formal
order
of
consolidation
of
record,
but
de
novo
review
of
the
question
of
the
consolidation
question.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
i
don't
know,
never
having
been
in
that
position.
the
number
of
cases
raising
this
issue
is
not
overwhelming.
it's...
i
think
it's
sufficient
to
allow
some
development
of
the
law,
but
it's
certainly
not
overwhelming,
and
what
the
rule
of
decision
would
be,
i
have
an
opinion
about
what
it
ought
to
be.
how
it
would
play
out
i'm
not
sure
with
any
confidence
i
can
suggest
to
your
honor,
and
i'm
of
course
here
focused
on
the
standard
of
review.
i'm
not
sure
that's
a
satisfactory
answer.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
the
career
offender?
mr.
dean
a.
strang
well,
certainly
the
question
of
relatedness
of
prior
cases
can
arise
in
any
calculation
of
criminal--
mr.
dean
a.
strang
--yes.
they
can
arise,
the--
mr.
dean
a.
strang
--i
think
not.
i
mean,
the
narrow
question
here
is
consolidation
as
the
path
to
relatedness,
and
at
least--
mr.
dean
a.
strang
--the
court
conceivably
could
do
that.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
well--
mr.
dean
a.
strang
--yes.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
the
rationale
would
be
that,
as
i
suggested
earlier,
the
initial
screening,
the
question
of
an
intervening
arrest,
ordinarily,
at
least
my
mind
struggles
to
find
a
situation
in
which
that
would
present
more
than
a
factual
or
pure
factual
issue.
did
crimes
occur
on
the
same
occasion?
ordinarily
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
fact-bound,
entirely
fact-bound
inquiry.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
that's
correct,
it
does
not.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
i
think
the
court
could.
whether
prudentially
it
ought
is
another
question,
but
i
think
it
could
because
at
least
as
i
read
this
court's
prior
decisions
on
mixed
questions
it
really
becomes
a
matter
of
deciding,
does
the
balance
tip
factual
or
does
the
balance
tip
legal?
does
it
tip
toward
one
class
of
judges,
one
level
in
the
hierarchy,
or
toward
the
middle?
mr.
dean
a.
strang
yes.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
i
think
it's
whether
the
mixed...
the
mixture
tips
factual
or
tips
legal
is
the
best
principle
i
can
identify.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
this
particular
guideline
yes,
and
then
the
guidelines
generally.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
for
the
rule
of
decision,
yes,
your
honor,
it
could.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
well,
and
of
course
under
stinson,
although
this
is
not
a
statute
it's
binding
law,
so
it
doesn't
merit
less
time
or
consideration
in
that
sense,
i
think,
but
again
i
have
to
acknowledge
because
of
mistretta
we
have
the
sentencing
commission
out
there,
and
when
we
get
to
the
question
of
the
rule
of
decision,
having
first
settled
the
standard
of
review,
yes,
the
sentencing
commission
can
weigh
into
that.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
but
i
think
de
novo
review
does
that,
and
it's
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
in
response
to
justice
souter's
question
as
well.
at
least
as
i
understand
the
theory,
or
a
theory
of
de
novo
review,
is
that
as
the
law
develops
clarity
through
that
process
lawyers
and
district
judges
are
more
likely
to
get
it
right
and
to
know
that.
the
district
court
is
very
bright.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
well,
it--
mr.
dean
a.
strang
--well,
in
the
end,
your
honor,
where
that
would
take
us
is
back
to
the
persuasion
that
the
district
courts
are
best
able
to
provide
uniformity
in
sentencing
and
that,
indeed,
at
page
12
of
the
united
states
brief,
is
an
assertion
it
makes,
and
that's
simply
at
war,
i
suggest,
with
the
basic
congressional
findings
and
purposes
of
the
sentencing
reform
act,
that
it
was
precisely
the
lack
of
uniformity
with
largely
unsupervised
district
judges--
mr.
dean
a.
strang
--yes.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
although
this
is
a
situation
where
the
difference...
although
not
1
and
20
years,
the
difference
is
really
quite
remarkable.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
want
to
revisit
the
question
of
the
sentencing
commission
and
the
interplay
with
de
novo
review.
this
court
in
mistretta
approved
the
basic
structure
and
rule
of
the
sentencing
commission,
of
course,
and
my
view
on
that,
or
anyone
else's,
no
longer
matters,
but
i
think
we
cannot
rely
here
too
much
on
the
sentencing
commission
or
cede
the
ground
properly
in
federal
courts.
for
one,
the
sentencing
commission
never
can
fix
disparity
in
a
given
case,
or
cure
a
lack
of
uniformity
in
the
cases
as
they
come.
it
can
act
only
to
try
to
reduce
or
prevent
that
in
the
future.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
i'm
sorry.
mr.
dean
a.
strang
it
can.
it
can
do
that.
i
wouldn't
expect
it
to
do
that
in
a
situation
like
this.
in
its...
its
powers
really
are
not
so
different
in
its
realm
than
would
be
congress'
power
in
the
realm
of
reconsidering
what
this
court
does
in
the
area
of
an
ordinary
statute.
congress
can
act
there,
too,
to
alter
the
rule
or
even
the
standard
of
review,
so
i
think
it's
clear,
3742
certainly
makes
it
clear,
i
think,
that
congress
envisioned
here
a
critical
role
for
the
courts
of
appeals.
the
question
then
is,
well,
at
what
level?
i
want
to
note
how
much
de
novo
and
deferential
review
look
the
same
in
terms
of
the
mechanical
tasks
that
judges
must
undertake.
it's
only
the
conclusory
act,
as
i
understand
it,
that
differs.
that
is,
the
briefs
must
be
read,
the
relevant
portions
of
the
record
must
be
examined,
and
in
the
end
the
difference
then
is
will
reasonable,
if
inconsistent,
conclusions
be
allowed
to
stand...
well,
yes,
that's
deferential
review...
or
does
a
court
of
appeals
simply
look
for
the
right
answer,
de
novo.
de
novo
review
continues
to
have
its
place
and
it
has
its
place
here,
just
as
much,
i
think,
as
de
novo
review
admittedly
on
a
case
by
case
basis
helps
us
understand
reasonable
suspicion,
or
helps
us
understand
probable
cause,
or
helps
understand
what
in
custody
means
for
miranda
purposes.
so
in
the
end
i'm
married
to
the
belief
that
the
word
do
in
37...
thank
you
very
much.
