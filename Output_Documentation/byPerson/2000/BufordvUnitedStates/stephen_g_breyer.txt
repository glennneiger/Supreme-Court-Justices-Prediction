justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
technically
i
think
you're
right
in
saying
the
words
which
come
out
of
an
application
note
in
a
guideline
about,
that
you
could
deem
a
thing
consolidated
when
it's...
what
is
the
exact
word
+/?
when
it's
functionally
consolidated,
when
it's...
you
know,
what
are
the
words
i'm
thinking
of,
functionally
consolidated
when
the
cases...
when
sentencing
was
joined,
okay.
now
you
want
to
know...
this
is
somebody
writing
an
application
note
in
the
guideline,
and
logically
speaking
nobody's
disputing
the
brute
facts.
they're
disputing
whether
sentencing
was
joined,
those
words,
sentencing
was
joined,
do
or
do
not
apply
to
this
undisputed
factual
situation
in
the
world,
so
if
you're
going
to
go
on
a,
all
legal
questions
are
for
the
court,
and
the
court
of
appeals,
all
factual
questions
are
for
the
trial
judge,
and
this
is
a
legal
question,
in
that
rubric
i
guess
you
win.
but
i
would
have
thought
that
there
were
millions
of
legal
questions
of
this
kind
that
are
really
for
the
trial
judge,
because
what
they
call
for
is
the
expertise
of
the
trial
judge,
and
they
are
so
minor
that
if
you
start
getting
court
of
appeals
into
all
that
thing,
what
you
will
produce
is
an
unbelievable
mess,
where
the
courts
of
appeals
try
to
figure
out
every
possible
ramification
of
the
application
of
every
application
note
in
the
guideline.
that's
what
i'm
worried
about,
with
accepting--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
i'm
thinking
is
that
the
words,
joint
sentencing,
are
words
that
every
trial
judge
in
the
united
states
would
understand
reasonably
well,
and
they're
words
that
i
as
an
appellate
court
judge
would
have
a
very
crude
understanding,
and
therefore
i'd
like
to
know
what
the
trial
judge
thinks
about
it
rather
than
what
i
think
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
haven't
done
joint
sentencing.
every
one
of
them
has.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true,
but
they
don't
have...
i
mean,
they
left
to
the
courts
to
work
out
what
would
be
a
sensible
relationship
among
trial
court,
appellate
court,
and
sentencing
commission,
and
therefore
i
would
think
what
justice
ginsburg
said
was
highly
relevant.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
it's
not
either
or--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
you
can
certainly
say
that
when
you
have
the
kind
of
question
that
trial
judges
know
quite
a
lot
about,
where
appellate
judges
know
not
that
much,
where
it
is
highly
complex
and
factually
related,
that
one
should
rely
upon
the
sentencing
commission
to
provide
the
necessary
uniformity,
and
that
would
be
a
strong
argument
in
favor
of
deferential
review
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
that's
why...
that's
why
probably
really...
i
actually
think,
i
guess,
is
if
an
appellate
court
decided
to
review
these
things
de
novo
that
would
be
fine.
if
an
appellate
court
decided
to
review
them
with
some
deference
that
would
be
fine.
but
the
people
who
ought
to
work
it
out
are
the
sentencing
commission,
i
mean,
which
they
can
do,
basically.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
suppose
i
thought
that,
i
mean,
i
can't...
i
promise
you
that
i
can
get
good
reasons
both
ways
what
it
should
be.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
the
way
the
sentencing
commission
would
work
it
out
is,
it
would
tolerate
differences
among
the
circuits
in
that
respect,
unless
it
really
began
to
show
up
in
different
sentences
being
given
to
different
people,
at
which
point
all
they'd
have
to
do
is
write
a
new
application
note.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
would
assign
it
to
a
staff
person,
look
into
it,
write
a
new
note
that's
clearer,
and
vote
on
it,
and
that's
the
end
of
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
and
normally
we
don't
hear
them.
normally
we
leave--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
we
don't
want
to
do
that,
if
we
want
to
follow
up
on
this
idea,
could
we
do
this?
could
you
say,
look,
we're
not
here
considering
whether...
the
word
in
the
guideline
is
consolidated.
or,
no,
the
word
in
the
application
note
is
consolidated,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
the
word
in
the
application
note
is
consolidated
for
sentence,
and
really
what
we're
considering
in
this
case
is
not
whether
consolidated
for
sentencing
has
to
be
de
novo
or
deferential.
we
are
considering,
in
the
circumstance
where
a
court
of
appeals
has
decided
that
the
words
consolidated
for
sentencing
include
something
called
functional
consolidation,
then
can
the
court
of
appeals
decide
that
that
concept
which
is
a
subset
of
consolidation,
namely
functional
consolidation,
maybe
should
be
reviewed
de
novo
or
not.
we
don't
have
to
get
into
whether
the
thing
of
the
document,
you
know,
consolidation
means
when
there's
an
order.
that's
not
before
us.
we're
considering
the
concept
called
functional
consolidation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
rather
tempted
by
that,
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--my
problem
with
it
is
that
i
can
think,
probably,
if
you
give
me
a
few
minutes,
which
i
won't
take,
of
instances
in
this
highly
complex
set
of
rules
and
thousands
of
words
in
the
guidelines
where
it
just
will
not
turn
out
to
be
right
always
to
let
the
district
court
have
its
way
when
it
applies
a
form
of
words
to
a
fact
situation,
but
there
will
be
many
others
where
it
seems
to
be
just
the
right
thing
to
do,
and
therefore
a
narrow
holding
might
be
preferable.
that's
my
thought.
i'd
like
your
view
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
hard
to...
the
reason
i
find
it
hard
to
do
it
that
way
is
in
the
statute
books
you
can
find
questions
where
all
you're
doing
is
applying
the
legal
label
to
a
fact
situation,
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world,
the
least
important
thing,
whether
a
newsboy
is
an
employee,
whether
a
foreman
is
an
employee.
the
same
description
applies
to
what
the
judges
do.
the
consequences
are
enormously
different.
you
see,
i
mean,
that's
a
classical
example,
but
that's
what
i'm
afraid
of
right
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
case
raises
a
narrow
question
of
federal
sentencing
law,
a
very
narrow.
imagine
under
the
sentencing
guidelines
a
trial
court
is
supposed
to
determine
whether
an
offender’s
prior
convictions
were
or
were
not
consolidated,
and
if
they
were
consolidated
then
they
are
related
and
if
they
are
related
they
count
as
a
single
conviction,
so,
his
sentence
does
not
go
up
as
much
as
if
they
were
not
consolidated.
imagine
the
trial
judge
makes
that
determination
and
then
the
question
before
us
is
what
standard
of
review
should
a
court
of
appeals
apply
when
it
reviews
that
determination?
the
relevant
statute
tells
the
appeals
court
to
give
due
deference
to
the
trial
court’s
decision.
the
offender
here
wants
de
novo
review
and
so
the
offender
argues
that
the
deference
that
is
due
is
no
deference
at
all.
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
the
offenders
claim.
it
thought
that
it
should
review
the
trial
court’s
determination
deferentially
and
we
conclude
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
right.
our
reasons
rest
primarily
upon
the
fact
that
the
trial
court
is
normally
in
a
better
position
to
determine,
whether
or
not
two
earlier
convictions
had
been
consolidated.
the
trial
court
is
in
a
better
position
to
make
that
determination
than
is
the
court
of
appeals.
hence,
we
think
that
deference
is
called
for.
we
explain
all
this
further
along
with
certain
other
related
matters
in
our
opinion.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
