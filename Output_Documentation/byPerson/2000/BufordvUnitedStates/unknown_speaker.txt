unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
you
could
have
a
case
where
the
trial
judge
says,
if
there
are
two
different
attorneys
for
the
state
appearing,
asking...
at
a
single
sentencing
proceeding,
that
there
are
two
different
attorneys
for
two
different
offenses
and
there
are
two
different
sentences,
that,
as
a
matter
of
law,
is
not
a
consolidated
sentencing.
i
suppose
a
judge
could
say
that,
and
if
he
said
that,
then
i
think
that
you
have
a
fairly
strong
case
that
this
would
be
a
statement
of
such
generality,
that
is
reviewable
de
novo.
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
point?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now,
but
won't
there
be
some
other
cases
where
it's
not
quite
so
clear,
and
where
the
judge
said,
well
now,
you
know,
i
know
how
these
state
court
judges
work,
and
it's
clear
to
me
that
the
two
sentences
were
related
because
the
length
of
the
drug
sentence
term
must
have
been
calculated
by
reference
to
what
he
gave
for
the
robbery
term.
that
might
be
a
different
case,
or
would
it?
unknown
speaker
do
we
ask
ourselves,
does
deference
mean
that
two
different
trial
judges
could
reach
different
conclusions
and
both
would
be
accepted?
unknown
speaker
i
could
see
that
happening
if,
in
the
case,
i
suppose,
the
federal
judge
was
trying
to
ask
what
the
state
judge
likely
did
with
reference
to
trying
to
balance
the
two
sentences.
i
think
you'd
have
a
stronger
point
if
he
says,
as
a
matter
of
construction
of
this
statute,
that
two
attorneys,
two
offenses,
two
separate
sentences
does
not
mean
textually
that
they're
consolidated.
they
are
not
consolidated.
unknown
speaker
i
think
he
came
pretty
close
to
that.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
your
argument...
i
mean,
if
this
is
the
point
of
justice
ginsburg's
question,
your
argument
is
that
the
only
way
to
get
uniformity
is
to
have
de
novo
court
of
appeals
review,
and
the
point
made
in
response
to
that
is
no,
you
could
achieve
substantial
uniformity
by
having
more
detailed
prescription
by
the
sentencing
commission
of
what
constitutes
consolidation
and
then
having
the
usual
deferential
review.
unknown
speaker
so
long
as
the
details
are
significant
enough,
you
know,
complete
enough,
you'll
get
reversed
even
on
deferential
review
if
you
fail
to
follow
them.
why
isn't
that
a
more
sensible
way
of
achieving
the
uniformity
that
you're
after
here?
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
the
statute
has
different
tests
for
relatedness,
some
of...
many
of
which
are
mixed
questions,
and
some
of
those
are
proper
for
de
novo
review,
and
others
not.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
sort
of
a
general
question?
we're
not
really
construing
a
statute
here.
we're
construing
a
note
in
the
guide...
in
a
particular
guideline.
to
what
extent,
if
there...
there
is
ambiguity
and
difficulty
in
figuring
out
what
the
consolidated
means
or
related
means.
isn't
there
something
the
sentencing
commission
could
give
greater
particularity
to
in
its
definition
of
the
relevant
terms?
unknown
speaker
it
just
sort
of
strikes
me
it's
sort
of
a
strange
issue
for
us
to
be
wrestling
with.
unknown
speaker
isn't
there
something
to
be
said,
too,
for
discouraging
rather
than
encouraging
a
great
number
of
appeals
of
sentencing
factors
to
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
a
very
optimistic
picture
of
the
legal
profession.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
you
know,
i
sometimes
think
we
take
a
case
here
to
decide
a
question
and
the
opinion
we
write
deciding
it
creates
three
new
questions
for
lawyers
to
argue
about,
so
i
don't
think
certainty
is
very
certain
in
anyway,
but
just
as
a
practical
matter
it
seems
to
me
it's
better
to
have
these
things
resolved
finally
by
the
district
courts
in
some
cases
than
simply
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
it
motivated
the
sentencing
commission--
unknown
speaker
--act,
there's
no
doubt
of
that,
but
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
we
don't
want
two
people
in
the
same
cell
block
in
leavenworth
convicted
of
the
same
thing,
one
serving
1
year
and
the
other
is
serving
20
years,
but
when
we
get
down
to
the
finer
points
there
may
be
more
to
be
said
for
discretion,
assuming
it's
consistent
with
the
guidelines.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now,
suppose
he
says,
where
there
are
two
offenses
and
two
attorneys
and
two
sentences,
that
is
not
consolidation?
unknown
speaker
he
then
does
go
on.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
this
is
a
sort
of
weird
case
in
that
normally
it's
fairly
clear
whether
the
cases
were
consolidated
or
not
consolidated,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this
question,
mr.
wolfson:
if
you
do
not
require
a
formal
order
of
consolidation,
as
i
understand
your
position,
how
could
this
have
been
more
consolidated?
one
judge,
one
proceeding,
two
sentences
imposed
at
the
same
time
to
run
concurrently.
what
other
possibly
could
make
it
consolidated
for
purposes
of
sentencing
except
a
formal
order?
unknown
speaker
but
they
could
be--
unknown
speaker
--but
all
those
things
could
happen
if
there
were
a
formal
consolidation,
too.
you
could
still
have
two
district
attorneys.
unknown
speaker
you
could
have
no...
you
could
have
two
plea
bargains,
too.
unknown
speaker
right,
i
see.
unknown
speaker
the
thing
that's
interesting
to
me,
i
have
a
lot
of
sympathy
for
your
basic
position,
but
on
the
facts
of
this
particular
issue
it
seems
a
little
hard
for
me
to
swallow.
the
thing
that's
really
hard
for
me
to
swallow
is
the
district
judge
came
out
the
other
way
and
said
it's
not
even
close.
he
said
they're
not
even
close
to
being
consolidated.
unknown
speaker
if
i
remember
it
correctly.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
under
this
guideline
we
have
to...
it
has
to
be
all
or
nothing
de
novo
review
or
deferential
review,
or
can
we
parse
it
out
and
say,
common
scheme
and
plan
are
deferential,
consolidation
is
de
novo,
or
do
we
just
make
a
mess
out
of
the
guideline
if
we
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
true...
i
mean,
under
deferential
review,
or
you
know,
abuse
of
discretion,
if
the
district
court
comes
to
a
legal
conclusion
that's
wrong
it
can
be
reversed
on
appeal,
can
it
not?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
your
response
to
this
was
going
to
be
that
you
don't
have
to
have
the
court
of
appeals
doing
the
job,
that
it
should
be
done
by
the
commission.
unknown
speaker
that
the
commission
can
promulgate
more
detailed
specifications
as
to
what
constitutes
consolidation
if,
indeed,
more
detail
is
needed,
or
desired.
unknown
speaker
--well,
mr.
wolfson,
my
understanding
of
the
rule
before
the
sentencing
guidelines
came
into
effect
was
that
a
majority
of
the
circuits
said
there
was
no
review
of
sentencing
so
long
as
it
was
within
the
limits
specified
by
law.
unknown
speaker
you're--
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
thought
it
can
act
retrospectively.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
its
rules
can
be
retrospective,
that
it
can,
indeed,
require
resentencing
in
light
of
its
new
rules.
