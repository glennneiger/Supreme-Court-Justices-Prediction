paul
stevens
well,
just
on
two
counts
of
an
indictment
you
get
two
different
sentences,
too.
i
mean,
i
have
difficulty
understanding
it
because
they
were
concurrent,
imposed
at
the
same
time
by
the
same
judge.
i
don't
know
how
you'd
get
more
consolidated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
word
consolidated,
it's
a
federal
question
as
to
whether
it's
consolidated,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
whether
it's
consolidated--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--within
the
meaning
of
the
note.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
the
irony
of
that
position
is
that
in
this
particular
case
the
bank
robberies
and
the
drug
addiction
seem
to
be
related.
justice
john
paul
stevens
related
in
a
realistic
sense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
she
was
robbing
the
banks
to
get
the
money
to
feed
her
drug
habit,
as
i
understand
it.
