let
me
ask
you
another
question.
i
guess
that
the
guidelines
provide
that
sentences
are
related
where
the
offenses
occurred
on
the
same
occasion,
or
were
part
of
a
common
scheme
or
plan,
and
those
questions
seem
to
involve
certain
factual
determinations.
do
you
think
that
on
appellate
review
there
would
be
a
de
novo
review?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
mixed
questions
of
fact
and
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
the
example
that
i
gave
you
of
common
scheme
or
plan
there
might
be
mixed
questions
of
fact
or
law,
and
would
there
be
de
novo
review
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
this
was
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law
here?
