justice
david
h.
souter
you
alluded
to
the
number
of
cases
that
would
be
implicated
by
the
decision
and
you
said,
you
know,
it's
not
an
overwhelming
number.
well,
i
suppose
it's
not
so
far
as
the
application
of
the
decision
to
beyond
career
criminal--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
career
offender
act,
but
i
suppose
there
would
be
an
application
whenever
guideline
sentences
were
imposed
in
consideration
of
prior
offenses,
and
i
suppose
the
number
of
those
would
be
enormous.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it...
i
mean,
it
must
do
so
thousands
and
thousands
of
times
a
day
in
the
federal
system,
mustn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
if
we
rule
your
way,
and
we
say
there
should
be
de
novo
review
here,
in
effect
as
a
matter
of
law,
then
i
would
suppose
the
courts
of
appeals
are
going
to
be
faced
with
a
tremendous
number
of
challenges
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
career
offender
act.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
i
don't
see
how
we
could...
well,
maybe
i
should
ask
this
question.
is
there
a
basis
upon
which
we
could
say
that
the
consolidation
question
should
be
reviewed
de
novo,
but
other
questions
of
relatedness
need
not
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
conceivably,
but
i
mean--
justice
david
h.
souter
--sensibly?
justice
david
h.
souter
how?
tell
me
what
the
rationale
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
but
that
does
not
exhaust
the
universe
of
questions
about
relatedness.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
so
i
come
back
to
my
question
to
you,
could
we
classify
consolidation
as
in
effect
an
issue
that
should
be
reviewed
as
if
it
were
a
legal
issue
and
hence
de
novo,
and
at
the
same
time
on
some
principle
basis
say
that
generally
the
question
of
relatedness
is
not
to
be
treated
as
if
it
were
a
legal
issue
and
subject
to
de
novo?
can
we
split
the
baby
that
way?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
no,
i
realize
that,
but
the
problem
i'm
having
is
simply
the
fact
that
there's
something
peculiar
about
this
issue,
because
consolidation
is
simply
a
subset
of
relatedness.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
would
seem
to
me
to
be
difficult,
as
a
matter
of
principle,
to
say
that
the
consolidation
issue
gets
de
novo,
whereas
relatedness
generally
does
not,
and
i
want
to
know
if
there
is
a
principle
basis
for
making
that
distinction,
what
that
basis
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
--not
quite
the
same,
because
those
usually
are
very
fact
related
to
the
facts
of
the
crime,
while
this,
in
fact,
is
a
matter
of
judicial
administration,
which
we
could
say
judges
throughout
the
system
are
somewhat
more
familiar
with.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
unlikely
you'll
get
an
odd
factual
situation
with
something
like
consolidation,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
a
concept
the
courts
make.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
it...
maybe
you
could
comment
on
this.
it
would
seem
to
me,
of
course,
you're
right
that
deference
doesn't
mean
no
review
at
all,
but
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
more
difficult
for
a
court
to
review
in
a
sensible
and
critical
way
a
decision
about
whether
consolidation
had
occurred
than
it
would
have
been
under
the
old
law
for
a
court
to
review
whether
a
sentence
was
appropriate
when
you're
asking
the
question,
should
the
sentence
have
been
10
years
or
20
years.
here,
we've
got
a
case
in
which
this
question
of
consolidation
is
going
to
make
the
difference,
as
i
recall,
between
doubling
a
sentence
or
not,
and
i
would
suppose
that
in
the
absence
of
some
clear
rule
it
would
be
more
difficult
to
review
the
consolidation
decision
under
the
guidelines
than
it
would
under
the
old
law
have
been
to
review
the
sentence
itself,
as,
say,
between
10
and
20
years,
which
is
a
very
strange
result.
am
i
seeing
things
in
a...
in
the
wrong
way
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
can
you
give
me
an
example...
give
me
an
example,
keyed
to
this
case,
perhaps,
of
the
kind
of
announcement
of
a
rule
governing
the
meaning
of
consolidation
that
would
be
appropriate
and
would
actually
make
a
practical,
critical
difference
when
courts
are
reviewing
consolidation
solely
for
abuse
of
discretion.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
we're
taking
this
case
in
the
context
that
there
is
something
called
functional
consolidation,
and
i...
i'm
assuming
that
that
really
could
cover,
as
you
in
your
argument
a
moment
ago
pointed
out,
a
tremendous
variety
of
facts.
you
said,
you
know,
even
if
you
come
down
with
a
rule
it
would
be
difficult
to
review
on
a
de
novo
basis
because
of
the
extraordinary
variety
of
facts,
so
we're
starting
with
the
assumption
that
you've
got
functional
consolidation,
number
2,
that
functional
consolidation
covers
a
tremendous
amount
of
district
territory.
if
you
make
those
assumptions,
what
kind
of
a
rule
on
abuse
of
discretion
review
could
a
court
announce
that
would
be
of
any
critical
help?
justice
david
h.
souter
ah,
but
all
smart
trial
judges
know
that
the
less
they
say
the
better,
and
smart
trial
judges
who
want
to
keep
control
of
sentencing
decisions,
which
the
guidelines
have
made
it
very
difficult
for
them
to
keep
control
of,
are
going
to
keep
their
mouths
relatively
shut.
justice
david
h.
souter
true
enough,
but
the
consequence
is
now,
since
the
commission
has
not
done
any
such
thing,
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
range
of
unreviewable
discretion
is
greater
when
a
court
is
determining
what
is
or
is
not
a
functional
consolidation
than
the
range
of
unreviewable
discretion
was
under
the
old
law
when
a
court
was
deciding
whether
to
give
10
years,
or
20
years,
or
50
years.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
i
think
what
your
argument
in
fact
means
is,
if
the
sentencing
commission
decides
to
get
into
this
with
more
detailed
rules,
then
the
discretion
is
going
to
be
limited,
but
if
the
sentencing
commission
doesn't,
then
we
are
left
with
what
seems
to
me
this
rather
ironic
situation
of
less
reviewable
discretion--
justice
david
h.
souter
and
didn't
some
circuits
take
the
position
that
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
review?
