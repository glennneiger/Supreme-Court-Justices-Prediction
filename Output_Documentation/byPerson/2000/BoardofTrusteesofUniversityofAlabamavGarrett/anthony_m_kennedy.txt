justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
general
waxman,
it's
not
magic
words.
the
whole
point
of
city
of
boerne
is
that
when
congress
alters
the
federal
balance
it
must
consider
very
carefully
the
consequences
of
doing
so,
and
to
say
that
it's
simply
magic
words
does
not
do
justice
or
respect
to
that
very
fundamental
principle,
and
the
federal--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
the
federal
balance
is
altered
far
more
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
than
it
is
under
the
commerce
clause.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but...
i'll
reread
cleburne,
but
cleburne
said
that
in
order
to
defer
to
the
authority
of
the
legislature
to
pass
a
zoning
law,
that
did
not
have
to
do
with
the
authority
of
the
legislature
to
declare
a
suspect
class.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
quite
different.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
persist
in
the
point
that
that
did
not
address
congress'
authority
and
scope
and
prerogatives
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that's
quite
different.
