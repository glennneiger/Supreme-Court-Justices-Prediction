justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
isn't
it
a
constitutional
violation
when
one
witness
said,
the
essex
junction
school
system
said
they
were
not
hiring
me
because
i
was
using
a
wheelchair?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
i
pick
that
out
because
the
sg's
brief
is
filled
with
references,
and
we
have
all
these
amicus
briefs
that
are
filled
with
references
along
the
lines
i
just
said.
now,
if
i...
is
it
that
i'm
supposed
to
count
all
those,
and
they
have
a
whole
lot
here
in
a
huge
stack
of
briefs,
and
count
them
all
and
then
say,
well,
they're
just
not
enough,
or
there
are
enough?
why
wouldn't,
say,
200
instances
like
that
be
enough?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they
tell
us,
for
example,
that
a
lot
of
states
didn't
have
laws,
to
use
this
case,
involving
cancer,
or
perceptions
of
handicap
which
really
weren't,
and
then
they
list
all
kinds
of
flaws
in
those
laws
in
these
briefs,
and
i
suppose
they're
probably
right
in
terms
of
the
facts
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
that's
what
i'm
asking.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to.
why
isn't
it
a
constitutional
violation
where
congress
has
lots
and
lots
of
instances
of
states
that
seem
to
discriminate
against
handicapped
people
under
instances
where,
given
the
information
in
front
of
them,
for
some
reason
or
other,
these
handicapped
people
have
not
been
able
successfully
to
avail
themselves
of
state
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if,
in
fact,
in
the
sixties,
there
had
been
discrimination
in
the
south,
and
we
discovered
there
was
a
state
law
banning
racial
discrimination,
congress
would
not
have
been
able
to
pass
laws
against
racial
discrimination
in
your
view
without--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you,
on
this
very...
the
sg
has
headlined
in
his
brief,
s
report
number
116,
at
page
18,
and
in
big
letters,
current
federal
and
state
laws
are
inadequate.
that
was
right
out
of
the
senate
report,
so
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
finding
that
current
federal
and
state
laws
are
inadequate?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
other
question,
but
that's
what
you
were
answering.
why
isn't
this
a
constitutional...
if
congress
finds
that
there
are
all
these
problems
going
on
with
the
states,
and
the
current
state
laws
are
inadequate
to
help
these
handicapped
people
who
are
discriminated
against,
why
isn't
that
sufficient
to
show
the
problem
that
permits
them
to
act
under
section
5?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
are
not
constitutional
violations
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
if
you
have
a
minute,
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
equal
protection
of
the
law.
equal
protection
of
the
law
might
be
violated
where
a
state
official
has
a
bad
reason
for
doing
something,
though
he
might
have
a
good
one.
as
you
point
out,
a
court
probably
wouldn't
catch
that
violation,
because
a
court
has
to
apply
a
rational
basis
test,
but
that's
for
institutional
reasons,
so
why
should
we
apply
such
a
test
where
the
institution
is
congress?
so
do
you
see
what
i'm...
i'm
trying
to
get--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
city
of
boerne,
if
i
find
city
of
boerne
ambiguous
on
this
point,
on
the
point
of
whether
it's
going
to...
whether
a
court
would
find
a
violation,
or
whether
there
is
a
violation,
if
i
find
it
ambiguous
on
that
point,
can't
i
pre
crank
in
my
institutional
considerations?
