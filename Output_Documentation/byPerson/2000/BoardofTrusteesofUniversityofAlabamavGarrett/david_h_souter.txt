justice
david
h.
souter
so
i
take
it
if
you
went
back
to
justice
breyer's
example
and
used
the
hypothesis
of
maybe
200
examples...
i
don't
know
how
many
we've
got,
but
maybe
that
many
were
adduced...
and
in
each
of
those
instances
congress
had
said
not
only,
we
find
here
is
an
example
of
an
instance
of
discrimination,
but
congress
had
also
expressly
said,
and
we
find
that
in
this
example
there
was
no
enforcement
of
state
law
to
correct
it,
and
it
had
matched
its
200
examples
with
200
examples
of
state
failure
to
enforce,
do
i
understand
your
position
to
be
that
then
there
would
be
an
adequate
legislative
predicate
under
section
5?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
difference
that
i
wondered
about
is,
kimel
i
thought
was
ambiguous
as
to
whether
or
not
a
rational
basis
test
applies,
and
i'd
be
interested...
i
know
you're
probably
aware
of
the
argument,
the
sg
makes
it,
that
rational
basis
is
a
test
that
courts
have
created
in
order
not
to
intrude
upon
the
province
of
the
legislature.
but
there
is
no
reason
to
have
the
province
of
the
legislature
not
intruding
upon
the
province
of
the
legislature
and,
therefore,
you
don't
need
to
apply
that
strict
a
matter
and
should
respect
the
congressional
judgment
that,
in
fact,
there
is
unreasonable
discrimination
being
exhibited
in
these
states
against
handicapped
people.
i
would
like
to
get
your
response
to
that
kind
of
an
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
think
the
issue
is
one
that
is
encompassed
by
getting
into
presumptions
of
constitutionality.
the
issue,
i
think,
that's
getting
raised
is
one
about,
let's
say
the
competence
of
the
courts
to
make
judgments,
particularly
when
we
get
into
the
rational
basis
area
to
make
sound
judgments
and
it
seems
that
the
courts
are
not
as
good
second
guessers
there,
perhaps,
as
legislatures
may
be.
but
the
fact
is,
congress
is
a
legislature,
and
it
is
not
laboring
under
the
judicial
disability
as
a
second
guesser,
so
why
do
we...
i
mean,
i
go
back
to
the
question
raised.
why
should
we
apply
the
same
standard
that
we
would
if
we
were
dealing
with
a
court's
review?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
right,
but
this
is
just
a
question
of
standard,
and
you're
saying,
look,
whatever
standard
you
apply,
be
careful
to
realize
that
you
don't
have,
on
your
view,
a
sufficient
predicate
in
the
record
to
pass
muster
on
any
standard.
that's
one
argument,
and
i
think
we
understand
that,
but
why
should
the
standard
be
the
same?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
go
back
to
the
remedy
question
that
justice
ginsburg
raised?
is
it
your
position
that
with
respect
to
the
damages
remedy
that
you
zeroed
in
on,
that
that
would
fail
the
proportionality
test
unless
the
same
remedy
were
applied
to
the
national
government
and
to
private
employers
generally?
is
that
the
position
that
you're
taking.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may
not
be
sufficient,
but
is
it
your
position
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
survive
the
proportionality--
