mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i
want
to
begin
by
responding
to
what
mr.
sutton
said
in
his
opening,
that
the
ada
rests
securely
on
the
commerce
clause.
no
state
would
ever
challenge
that,
and
so
what's
at
issue
here
is
quite
narrow.
indeed,
states
are
challenging
in
the
lower
courts
the
commerce
clause
predicate
for
title
ii
of
the
ada,
and
they
are
arguing
that
in
light
of
this
court's
decisions
in
lopez
and
morrison
that
so
many
state
activities
and
programs
are
not
commercial
in
character
and,
thus,
cannot
be
reached
by
the
commerce
clause,
so
that
were
this
court
to
hold
that
the
ada
is
not
proper
fourteenth
amendment
legislation,
there
is
significant
danger
that
the
ada
would
be
without
a
constitutional--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--so
far
there
is
one
district
court
that
has
bought
the
argument,
pierce
v.
king,
918
f.
supp.
932.
the
issue
is
now
pending
in
several
courts
of
appeals
on
appeals
by
the
state.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
no,
because
a
county
or
a
city...
if
you
take
the
fourteenth
amendment
away,
the
fourteenth
amendment
argument...
the
eleventh
amendment
argument
is
available,
of
course,
only
to
a
state,
but
if
you
say
that
the
ada
is
not
grounded
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
courts
later
hold
that
it
is
not
grounded
in
the
commerce
clause,
then
it
is
not
appropriate
legislation
directed
to
either,
as
we
understand
it.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
except
only...
title
ii
applies
only
to
the
states,
and
so
it,
losing
title
ii
is
losing...
i'm
sorry.
in
that
sense
it
applies
to
state
and
local
governments,
and
if
it
goes
down
under
the
commerce
clause
then
state
and
local
governments
will
not
be
governed
by
title
ii.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
no.
if
you
resolved
in
this
case,
although
the
question
is
not
presented,
the
conflict
among
the
circuits
as
to
whether
employment
discrimination
also
violates
title
ii,
and
if
you
decided,
adversely
to
our
position,
that
it
does,
the
position
we
advanced
in
the
lower
courts,
then
yes,
only
title
i
would
apply
to
employment,
and
only
it
would
be
at
issue.
but
we
would
hope
that
before
this
court
resolved
that
important
issue
that
has
divided
the
courts
of
appeals,
that
there
would
be
an
opportunity
for
briefing.
in
this
case,
the
petitioners
never
raised
an
objection
to
title
ii's
application
to
employment,
so
it
never
became
an
issue
in
this
case.
now,
i
want
to
turn
to
the
merits
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
argument
and
we
want
to
suggest
as
a
preliminary
petitioners
have
never
really
acknowledged
an
important
body
of
fourteenth
amendment
decisional
law,
which
is
that
even
when
we're
dealing
with
groups
or
classifications
that
are
covered
by
the
rational
basis
standard,
it
is
irrational
for
a
state
to
act
with
a
purpose
that
is
irrational.
a
number
of
supreme
court
decisions
have
held
that
state
action
that
rests
on
invidious
prejudice,
irrational
fear,
false
stereotypes
that
have
evolved
from
those
prejudices
and
fears,
desires
not
to
be
discomforted
by
association
with
disfavored
classes,
patronization,
if
that's
what
actually
motivates
a
state
decision,
that
itself
provides
the
irrationality
which
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
surely
it's
the
case
that
when
we
see
that
there
could
be
no
rational
basis,
that
will
fuel
our
conclusion.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
but
the
irrational
purpose
prong
of
fourteenth
amendment
jurisprudence
is
not
limited
only
to
those
cases
where
it
is
irrational,
where
the
decision
itself
would
have
to
be
irrational.
that
is
to
say,
it's
a
well
developed
concept
that
a
state
may
take
an
action
where
there
could
be
some
rational
reason
for
the
action,
but
we
determined
that
reason
is
a
pretext--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--that
what
really
motivated
them
was
hostility
to
the
class.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
that
problem
of
proof,
your
honor,
is
precisely
why
congress
found
the
need
to
adopt
prophylaxis
here,
and...
but
i
want
to,
before
i
get
to
that,
to
lay
out
just
what
congress--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--correct,
so--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes,
it
did.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
what
it
did
was
find
that
these
kinds
of
motivated
actions
are
widespread.
let's
just--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--widespread.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
pervasive
was
their
word.
what
they
said
in
the
findings
on
the
face
of
this
statute
is
that
there
is
pervasive
prejudice,
still,
today,
or
still
in
1990,
when
they
enacted
this
statute,
there
is
pervasive
prejudice
against
persons
with
disabilities,
a
history
of
purposeful
unequal
treatment,
outright
intentional
exclusion,
stereotypical
assumptions
that
are
wholly
false
and
linked
to
prejudice,
and
they
said
these
animuses,
or
animi,
have
been
aimed
at
a
group
which
has
been
historically
disfavored
and
which
constitutes
a
discrete
and
insular
minority.
there
is
a
we
they
way
in
which
people
think
about
persons--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes,
because
congress
went
through
enormous
volumes
of
material
that
showed
that
state
action
had
been
taken
on
the
basis
of
that
prejudice.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
fair
enough,
your
honor.
here,
i
will
talk
only
about
states
and
only
about
employment,
because
that
is
the
narrowest
focus.
as
the
government's
brief
shows,
there
was
an
enormous
volume
of
state
discrimination
across
wide
sectors,
really
everywhere,
which
is
not
surprising
if
you
accept
the
premise
that
there
are
pervasive,
widely
held
prevalent
views
that
stigmatize
and
disadvantage
persons
with
disabilities.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
fourteenth
amendment--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
correct.
congress
had
two...
three
kinds
of
evidence.
number
1,
it
had
individual
incidents,
and
it
had
them
in
substantial
number.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
i'll
give
you...
here's
a
couple
of
examples.
a
woman
crippled
by
arthritis
is
denied
a
job
as
a
teacher
in
a
university
because
they
don't
want
the
students
to
have
to
look
at
her.
that
is
prejudice
of
a
kind
that
would
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
testimony
of
the
teacher.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
because
the
state--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
the
states
were...
the
states
spoke
about
this
statute.
they
spoke
in
favor
of
this
statute.
the
states
told
congress,
a)
we
have
this
problem,
and
b)
state
laws
are
inadequate
to
deal
with
it.
that's
why
we
support
the
enactment
of
this
statute.
we
need
the
remedies.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
there
are
hundreds
of
these,
your
honor,
not
one,
hundreds.
but
broader
than
that...
if
your
honor
wants,
i'll
give
you
some
more.
a
microfilmer
at
the
kansas
department
of
transportation
is
fired,
and
he
is
told,
the
reason
you
are
being
fired
is
that
we
have
now
discovered
that
you
have
epilepsy.
he
has
throughout
his
tenure
there
been
performing
above
the
standards
required
for
employment
there.
now,
your
honor
can
say--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
is
correct,
and
congress
thought
that--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--they
could
if
they
could
prove
the
motivation.
they
would
have
to
prove
the
motivation.
they
would
have
the
burden
of
proving
the
motivation,
but
yes,
if
pat
garrett
was
demoted
from
her
position
as
director
of
nursing
because
of
some
antipathy
on
the
part
of
the
person
who
made
that
decision,
or
some
irrational,
erroneous
stereotype,
that
would
be
a
case--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
there
are
cases...
because
of
the
prior
existence
of
section
504,
we've
cited
in
our
briefs
some
cases
that
were
brought.
understandably
courts
don't
reach
constitutional
questions,
so
they
can
find
it
violates
the
statute,
but
the
findings
made
in
those
cases
are
that
employees
were
denied
jobs
out
of
irrational
antipathy.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
because
it
is
the
burden
on
the
plaintiffs...
first
of
all
there
have
not
been
that
many
cases...
we...
let
me
back
up
for
a
minute.
we
would
not
expect
to
see
reported
decisions
of
that.
if
a
plaintiff
comes
in
and
has
the
kind
of
evidence
that
would
win
an
equal
protection
clause,
the
odds
are
that
case
is
going
to
get
resolved
before
you
ever
see
a--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--no,
that
they
have
made
claims
and
have
prevailed
under
section
504,
with
the
court
not
reaching,
as
it
should
not
reach,
a
constitutional
question
if
it
finds
that
the
statute
was
violated,
but
i--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes,
the
three
prongs.
one
was
the
individual
cases.
second
is
the
studies.
congress
had
a
number
of
studies
of
state
employment.
they're
all
cited
in
our
brief.
one
of
those
studies
was
performed
by
a
congressionally
created
committee,
the
advisory
committee
on
intergovernmental
relations,
whose
very
function
was
to
police
whether
congress
was
overregulating
the
states,
unnecessarily
regulating
the
states.
its
membership
consisted
predominantly
of
state
and
local
governmental
officials,
and
it
submitted
a
report
to
every
member
of
congress
while
the
ada
was
under
consideration
recounting
the
findings
of
its
own
inquiries
of
state
officials
in
which
it
asked
state
officials,
can
you
explain
why
there
is
such
a
low
percentage
of
persons
with
disabilities
working
for
you?
and
overwhelmingly
those
state
officials
responded,
yes,
the
problem
is
that
middle
managers,
the
people
who
make
these
kinds
of
decisions,
the
personnel
decisions
in
our
state,
are
afflicted
with
negative
attitudes
about
persons
with
disabilities,
discomfort
about
working
among
them,
myths
and
stereotypes
about
the
incapacity
of
people
with
disabilities
to
perform
jobs,
things
that
have
been...
and
the
report
goes
on
to
say
this.
empirical
studies
over
and
over
and
over
again
have
shown
that
these
myths
are
false,
that
there
is
not
a
higher
turnover
rate
among
persons
with
disabilities.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
congress...
you
say
are
these
findings
by
congress.
congress
made
extensive
findings
that
these
things
are
true,
that
all
of
these
things
are
animating
decisions.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
this
was
a
report
to
congress,
and
we
cite
six
other
reports
by
various...
many
of
them
conducted
by
the
states
themselves,
saying
we
have
a
terrible
problem.
our
supervisors
have
qualms
about
hiring
people
with
disabilities.
they're
uncomfortable
with
it.
so
that's
the
second
body
of
evidence,
and
the
third
body
of
evidence
is
the
evidence
that
congress
had
about
the
reality
of
the
psychological
attitudes
in
our
society
about
people
with
disabilities.
in
accommodating
the
spectrum,
which
was
the
report
of
the
civil
rights
commission,
they
relied
upon
extensive
bodies
of
professional
evidence
that
showed
that
there
were
four
crippling
attitudes
that
many
people
in
our
society
have
about
people
with
disabilities.
they
are
discomforted
about
being
around
them.
they
have
stigmatic
attitudes
about
them.
they
think
they
are
inferior,
less
than
normal
human
beings,
that
they
hold
all
kinds
of
erroneous
stereotypes
about
them,
that
cancer
is
contagious,
that
epilepsy--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--my
light
is
on,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
point
is
that--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--no,
the
answer
is--
[laughter]
no,
the
answer
is,
they
have
all
three
together.
it's
not
just,
should
we
rely
on
psychiatrists.
we
have
the
evidence
of
what
actually
is
happening.
we
have
the
acknowledgements
of
the
state
in
these
studies,
and
we
have
the
understanding
of
why
this
is
happening
from
the
psychological
studies.
