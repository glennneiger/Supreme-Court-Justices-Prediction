unknown
speaker
let's--
unknown
speaker
--and
today?
what
about
today?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you,
suppose
we
have
a
real
case
or
a
hypothetical
case
along
the
lines
described
by
justice
breyer,
a
very
egregious
case,
a
person
absolutely
confined
to
a
wheelchair.
that
person
can't
get
into
the
court
hearing
on
time,
or
can't
get
into
a
voting
booth,
and
you
have
an
insensitive
state
official.
in
that
single
discrete
case,
could
there
be
an
action
brought
under
the
equal
protection
clause
to
compel
the
access,
compel
access
to
the
court,
compel
access
to
the
building?
unknown
speaker
that's
why
i'm
asking.
unknown
speaker
would
the
court
be
wrong
to
say
that
there's
a
quasi...
would
the
court
be
wrong
to
say
there's
a
quasi
suspect
class
here,
or
suspect
class?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out--
--mr.--
--is
if
there's
ever
an
equal
protection
violation
on
a
stand
alone
discrete
case--
unknown
speaker
--where
a
state
discriminates
against
a
person
by
reason
of
a
severe
handicap.
unknown
speaker
does
that
state
an
equal
protection
violation,
and
if
it
does,
why
is
it
that
the
courts
can
do
what
congress
cannot?
that's
the
line
of
inquiry
i--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
it
would
seem
that
that's
one
consequence
of
your
argument,
and
i
want
you
to
address
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sutton--
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
sutton,
isn't
this
an
employment
case
rather
than
an
access
case?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
in
that
kind
of
a
hypothetical
you
would
agree
that
that
could
be
a
constitutional
violation?
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
you
win
this
case,
congress
could
go
back
and
dredge
up
from
its
record
its
200
examples
and,
if
congress
said
well,
we
now...
you
know,
we've
checked
into
this,
and
in
each
of
these
examples
there
was
no
state
enforcement,
congress
could
then
pass
the
act
again
under
section
5
and
it
would...
on
your
view
would
be
valid?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
--why
weren't
they
asking
about
the
constitutionality
if
they
explicitly
abrogate
the
state's
immunity?
unknown
speaker
they
could
only
do
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
so
then
they
must
have
been
talking
about
the
fourteenth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
well,
your...
i'm
sorry.
that's
a
proposition
a
little
hard
to
maintain,
because
in
the
age
discrimination
area
this
court
has
never
found
a
violation
of
the
rational
basis
test,
but
in
the
handicapped
area
we've
found
a
bunch
of
violations.
unknown
speaker
but
there
are
a
number
of
other
areas
where
there
have
been
constitutional
violations,
but
none
in
the
age
area.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
not
that
it
was
unconstitutional
to
place
the
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
that
person's
age.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
if
you
think
the
congressional
findings
might
have
been
phrased
a
little
differently
if
they'd
been
made
after
the
seminole
decision?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
you're
suggesting
that
we
treat
the
congress
of
the
united
states
as
a
trial
court
and
remand
the
case
to
them
to
prepare
better
findings.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
catch
the
last
word,
mr....
are
what?
unknown
speaker
widespread.
unknown
speaker
that
proves
that
prejudice
exists.
does
it
prove
that
state
action
has
been
taken
on
the
basis
of
that
prejudice
when
there
is
rational
basis
for
the
state
action?
unknown
speaker
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
could
the
plaintiffs
have
gone
to
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
and
established
an
equal
protection
violation?
unknown
speaker
are
there
cases
in
the
state
courts,
or
in
the
lower
federal
courts
which
have
accepted
this
rationale?
unknown
speaker
but
if
this
is
so
evidently
an
equal
protection
violation,
why
haven't
courts
for
the
last
30,
40,
50
years
routinely
entertained
these
challenges
and
given
relief?
unknown
speaker
you're
telling
me
that
over
the
last
30
or
40
or
50
years
there
have
been
numerous
cases
in
the
courts
where
handicapped
and
disabled
people
have
routinely
made
equal
protection
claims
and
prevailed?
unknown
speaker
were
these
findings
by
congress?
unknown
speaker
this
report
that
you're
now
describing
was
a
report
made
to
congress
by--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
think
it
is
proper
to
leap
from
these
general
psychological
generalizations
about
the
society
at
large,
and
state
employers
in
particular,
to
the
conclusion
that
the
states
have
been
acting
unconstitutionally?
unknown
speaker
the
answer
is
yes.
unknown
speaker
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
have
to
write
more
dissents
and
concurring
opinions,
i
guess,
if
i
want
to
be
really
influential.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
unconstitutional.
did
they
use
the
words--
unknown
speaker
--unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
what
does?
unknown
speaker
the
congressional
findings
here?
