justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
willing
to
concede,
apparently,
that
it
is
a
constitutional
violation
not
to
make
special
provision
in
public
buildings
for
those
who
are
handicapped.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
of
any
case
that
has
held
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
congress
was
speaking
of
discrimination
could
it
possibly
have
been
referring
to
the
statutory
definition
of
discrimination?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
compatibility
between
that
and
the
constitutional
requirement
of
equal
protection?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
why
you're
running
away
from
it.
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
core
issue
in
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
--whether,
in
fact...
whether,
in
fact,
making
special
accommodation
for
those
who
are
handicapped,
or
the
failure
to
do
so,
is
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
i
think
if
it
is
your
case
is
a
hard
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
there
were
no
rational
basis
for
it,
in
other
words.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
might
be
a
rational
basis
for
refusing
to
hire
a
teacher
who
was
in
a
wheelchair--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
only
that
the
school
is
not
properly
equipped
to
accommodate
such
a
teacher.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
question
is,
i
suppose,
inadequate
to
do
what,
inadequate
to
do
the
good
things
that
need
doing?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
inadequate
to
assure
compliance
with
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
report
doesn't
say
the
latter.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
think
that
if
you
lose
the
commerce
clause
challenge
the
least
of
your
worries
is
the
states.
you're
going
to
have
many
more
businesses
who
employ
people,
that
they're
going
to
be
exempt.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
how
does
one
usually
determine
that?
i
mean,
i
would
usually
consider
it
to
be
irrational
and
motivated
by
prejudice
when
there's
no
practical
reason
for
it.
doesn't
it
boil
down
to
the
same
thing?
you
look
to
see
whether,
indeed,
there's
a
rational
basis
for
what's
been
done.
if
there's
no
rational
basis,
you
say
it
must
be
motivated
by,
you
know,
irrational
prejudice
or
stereotyping,
or
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
it
advances
the
ball.
i
think
the
two
boil
down
to
the
same.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
just
don't
know
how
you
prove
that,
except
by
looking
at
whether
there
is,
in
fact,
a
rational
basis.
how
do
you
prove
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
puts
the
cart
before
the
horse.
they
have
to
have
shown
unconstitutional
state
action
before
they
can
use
the
prophylaxis.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
saying
the
unconstitutional
state
action
is
going
to
be
based
upon
not
the
realities
out
there,
whether
there
was
a
rational
basis,
but
whether,
even
though
there
was
a
rational
basis,
the
states
somehow
were
acting
out
of
irrational
hatred
of
the
disabled.
how
do
you
establish
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
congress
establish
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
tell
me
how.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
when
you
say
discrimination
in
answer
to
this
question,
you
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--unconstitutional--
justice
antonin
scalia
--unconstitutional
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
basis
for
that
finding?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
there...
of
the
teacher?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
there
any
testimony
on
the
other
side?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
hear
one
side
and
make
a
finding?
justice
antonin
scalia
one
witness
who
says,
the
reason
i
didn't
get
promoted
was
my
arthritis,
and
congress
says
state...
unconsitutional
state
discrimination.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
unconstitutional
discrimination?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
irrational
discrimination?
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
it's
good
or
bad--
justice
antonin
scalia
--maybe
it
shouldn't
exist,
but
you
think
there
is
no
rational
basis.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
judicial
findings,
a
question
posed
to
your
colleague.
one
would
really
have
expected,
if
this
was
a
massive
constitutional
problem,
that
there
would
have
been
a
large
number
of
cases
that
had
found
the
states
guilty
of
unconstitutional
action.
