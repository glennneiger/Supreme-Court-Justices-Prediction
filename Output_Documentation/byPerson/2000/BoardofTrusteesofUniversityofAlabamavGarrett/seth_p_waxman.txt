mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
question
was...
reference
was
made
to
the
caption
in
the
senate
report,
and
it
also
appears
in
the
house
report,
of
congress'
conclusion
that
the
state
remedies
were
inadequate,
a
conclusion
that
was
also
supported
by
the
50
state
governors'
committees
that
examined
this
issue,
and
the
question
i
think
that
justice
scalia
asked
was,
inadequate
to
do
what,
because
that,
after
all,
is
the
issue.
now,
this
is
a
case
where
a
statute
was
enacted
before
seminole
tribe
and
before
boerne,
and
therefore
the
paradigm
that
this
court
has
created
for
the
words,
the
precise
magic
words
that
we
would
now
expect
congress
to
use
didn't...
can't,
i
think,
fairly
be
imposed
on
a
coordinate
branch
of
government.
but
the
answer,
justice
scalia,
to
the
question,
i
think,
is
determined
by
reference
to
what
the
legislative
record
before
congress,
not
only
when
it
conducted
its
eighteen
hearings
and
amassed
seven
separate
complete
reports
in
enacting
the
ada,
but
also
when
it
investigated
the
problems
that
led
it
to
create
the
cripa
statute,
the
constitutional
rights
of
institutionalized
persons,
and
idea,
and
others,
but
looking
just...
looking--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
absolutely--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
kennedy,
i
agree,
and
i
would
say
therefore
that
the
question
fairly
put
is
whether
the
disabilities
act
sweeps
more
broadly
than
congress
could
reasonably
have
deemed
necessary
to
remedy
and
prevent
the
constitutional
problem
it
found
applying
this
court's
definition
of
the
standard,
and
what
it
found
were
four
things.
it
found,
first,
that
there
is
pervasive
and
widespread
discrimination
against
the
disabled,
which
is
often
the
product
of
hostility,
overbroad
and
irrational
stereotypes,
and
deliberate
selective
indifference,
the
hallmarks
of
unconstitutional
intent.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no,
i...
well,
i
don't
think
a
court
would...
a
court
would
not
find
that
invalid,
applying
a
rational
basis
standard,
because
this
court
has
had...
has
held
that
under
rational
basis
review
of
legislation
one
looks
at
whether
there
is
a
conceivable
rational
basis
that
would
support
a
distinction,
and
that,
in
fact--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
justice...
mr.
chief
justice,
this
court
has
made
clear
that
as
a
paradigm
of--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--was...
if
your
question
was
whether
i
also
understood
mr.
gottesman
to
say
that,
i--
[laughter]
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
do
not
agree
that
a
legislature
that
could
have
had
a...
a
legislature
that
could
have
had
a
rational
reason
for
doing
something
which,
in
fact,
was
motivated
by
invidious
discrimination
would
be
struck
down
if
this
court
applied
rational
basis
review,
but
cleburne,
it
seems
to
me,
and
the
other
cases
in
which
this
court
has
dealt
with
and
remarked
on
discrimination
against
the
disabled
points
the
way
to
the
correct
resolution
of
this
case,
and
before
i...
i
do
want
to
address
that,
but
first
i'll
finish--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--in
cleburne--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
there
is
a
great
debate
about
the
answer
to
that
question,
but
i
will
answer
the
question
on
the
assumption
that
the
court
in
fact
applied
rational
basis
review,
but
what
the
court
explained
was
that
rational
basis
review
is
contextual,
and
context,
just
like
applying
the
proportionate
and
congruence
test,
is
contextual,
and
it
requires
a
reference
to
the
historical
context
in
which
it
arises.
and
what
this
court
said
in
cleburne
is,
we
are
not
going
to
look
first
at
the
facial
constitutionality
or
unconstitutionality
of
this
statute.
we're
going
to
require,
in
the
unique
context
of
a
history
of
pervasive
invidious
discrimination
against
the
disabled,
what
this
municipality's
reasons
were.
and
having
looked
at
that,
it
concluded
that
the...
that
it
must
have
been
motivated
by
an
invidious
intent,
because
the
proferred
reasons
were
not,
in
fact,
rational.
now,
cleburne,
in
the
context
of
many
other
cases
in
which
this
court
and
justices
of
this
court
have
remarked
on
the
history
of
pervasive
invidious
discrimination
against
the
disabled,
provided...
essentially
gave
congress
the
blueprint
in
which
it
acted
in
this
case,
and
here's
why.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
our
argument
doesn't
depend
on
it,
but
i
think
the
answer
from
cleburne
is
yes,
because
in
cleburne
what
this
court
said...
and
i
don't
have
the
exact
words
in
front
of
me...
was
that
because
discrimination
against
the
disabled
is
such
a
complicated
issue,
that
is,
because
there
are
reasons
why
differential
treatment
is
sometimes
permitted
and,
indeed,
perhaps
the
constitution
sometimes
requires
it,
that
we
have
to
give
broad
deference
to
the
legislatures,
and
we
have
to
let
legislatures
deal,
as
they
more
competently
can,
with
this
difficult
problem,
unless--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
what
this
court
said
in
cleburne
is,
because
of
that
unique
history,
absent
congressional
direction,
we
will
apply,
as
a
paradigm
of
judicial
restraint,
rational
basis
review.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--and
i'm
not
suggesting
to
the
contrary,
justice
kennedy.
i
was
responding
to
justice
o'connor's
question
about
whether
a
legislature
could
instruct
a
court
to
apply
a
different
level
of
scrutiny,
and
the
language
in
cleburne
that
says
access--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--we...
i
believe,
as
cleburne
says,
absent
congressional
direction
we
apply
rational
basis
for
review.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
agree
that
that's
not
necessarily
the
case,
but
if
i
can
simply
point
out,
justice
kennedy...
this
actually
does
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
original
question...
that
not
only
was...
i
mean,
it
is
important,
it
is
critical
here
to
understand
that
not
only
does
the
congress
find
a
massive
record
of
discrimination
based
on
states
of
mind
that
are
the
hallmarks
of
constitutional
intent,
but
also
that
this
discrimination
is
the
legacy
of
a
not
too
distant
past
in
which
government
practices
deliberately
isolated,
segregated,
and
withheld
from
the
disabled
fundamental
rights
and
the
chance
to
participate
in
mainstream
life.
when
justice
marshall
wrote,
in
his
separate
opinion
in
cleburne,
a
statement
that
no
justice
contradicted,
that
a
regime
of
state
mandated
segregation
and
degradation
that
in
its
virulence
and
bigotry
rivaled
and,
indeed,
paralleled
the
worst
excesses
of
jim
crow--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--not
at
all,
justice--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--mr.
chief
justice,
the
point
i'm
making
is
more
broadly
that
congress
itself
had
before
it
a
record
not
only
of
what
was
going
on
currently,
but
what
had
produced
it.
the
civil
rights
commission
prepared
a
report--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i'm...
as
an
observation
of
historical
fact,
congress
could
certainly
rely
on
it,
and
he
was
not
the
only
one
in
cleburne
to
make
that
observation.
justice
stevens,
writing
for
himself
and
the
chief
justice,
said
that
through
ignorance
and
prejudice
the
mentally
retarded
have
been
subjected
to
a
history
of
unfair
and
often
grotesque
mistreatment.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
so
that
i
am
not...
i
don't
want
to
be
misunderstood.
this
is
not
an...
i'm
using
the...
justice
marshall's
categorization
because
i
think
it
well
reflects
the
evidence
that
congress
itself
heard.
the
civil
rights
commission
report
accommodating
the
spectrum
which
was
submitted
to
congress
at
its
request
details
at
great
length,
and
was
decided...
and
was
issued
before
cleburne,
the
history
of
state
sponsored
intentional,
pervasive
isolation
and
segregation
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
forced...
yes,
it
does.
forced
sterilization,
refusal
to
allow--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
civil
rights
commission
report
uses
the
word,
unconstitutional,
but
whether
it
does
or
not,
the
practices...
i
don't
think
anybody...
i
don't
think
that
mr.
sutton
would
conclude
that
the
historical
practices...
and
i'm
not
suggesting
they
persist,
but
we're
talking
here
about
a
section
5
authority
not
only
to
deal
with
a
pervasive
current
problem,
but
to
remedy
the
effects
of
past
intentional
unconstitutional
discrimination.
the
remedy
for
past
segregation
and
isolation
is
integration,
and
that
explains
in
part
why
the
disabilities
act
admittedly
reaches
some
conduct
that
a
court
applying
rational
basis
review
would
not
deem
unconstitutional.
it's
both.
it's
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
one
thing
one
can
certainly
say,
whatever
words
one
uses,
and
justice
stevens
in
his
concurrence
in
cleburne,
as
i
recall
it,
basically
says,
i
don't
really
know
whether
we
have
three
distinct
typologies.
i
consider
all
of
this
rational
basis
review.
it
just
depends
on
how
high
the
justification
is
and
how
great
the
reason
there
is
to
suspect
that
something
unconstitutional
may
be
going
on.
but
it
is
clear
that
what
cleburne
did
was,
in
looking
at
the
actual
administrative
bureaucratic
decision,
as
opposed
to
the
legislative
choice,
require
an
articulation
of
the
actual
reasons
in
the
context
of
alleged
discrimination
in
this
unique
historical
area.
and
what
congress
did
essentially
was
to
generalize
what
this
court
did
in
cleburne.
it
took
this
court's
specific
inquiry
in
cleburne
in
the
light
of
the
court,
many
instances
in
which
the
majority
of
this
court
has
remarked
about
the
history
of
discrimination
in
choate,
alexander
v.
choate
and
other
cases,
and
it
applied
it
to
what
congress
had
in
front
of
it,
which
was
on
the
one
hand
a
body
of
half
a
dozen
or
a
dozen
comprehensive
studies
detailing
a
widespread
problem
and
historic
unconstitutional
practices,
and
over
5,000
narrative
accounts
that
the
congressional
task
force
accumulated
of
individual
instances
of
discrimination
against
the
handicapped,
600
of
which
addressed
state
or
local
governments
which
for
purposes
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
state
action
have
to
be
considered
as
one.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
may
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--may
i
answer?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
at
footnote
11
in
our
brief
we
cite
some
of
those
decisions
but,
as
this
court
recognized
in
watson
v.
forth
worth
bank
&
trust
there
are
many,
many
instances
in
which
subconscious
attitudes
and
prejudices
cannot
be
proved
to
a
judicial
exactitude.
thank
you
very
much.
