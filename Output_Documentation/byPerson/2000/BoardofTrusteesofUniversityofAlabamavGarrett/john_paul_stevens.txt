but
the
particular
claims
are
employment
claims,
and
is
it
not
at
least
theoretically
possible
that
refusal
of
employment
to
a
person
because
of
a
handicap
would
be
an
equal
protection
violation,
regardless
of
whether
the
access
provision
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
should
they
have
ruled--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
nobody
with
an
artificial
limb
can
ever
have
a
job
of
a
certain
character?
you
could
say
that
wouldn't
pass
the
rational
basis
test,
couldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
assuming
there
was
evidence
of
that
kind
of
discrimination,
i
really
don't
understand
the
argument
that
the
fact
that
there
are
state
remedies
also
available
makes
it
impermissible
for
there
to
be
a
federal
remedy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--why
couldn't
there
be
a
fourteenth
amendment
federal
remedy,
even
though
there
also
was
a
state
remedy?
i
don't
quite
understand
the
thrust
of
your
main
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
fact
that
a
state
remedy
exists
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
discrimination
is
not
taking
place.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gottesman,
what
are
your
other
two
arguments?
you
had
three,
i
believe.
