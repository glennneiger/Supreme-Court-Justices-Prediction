justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
sutton,
would
you...
i
thought
we
were
talking
just
about
the
employment
section,
those
of
the
ada,
but
you're
saying
no,
it's
broader
than
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
sutton,
you've
made
something
in
your
brief
of
the
absence
of
a
congressional
provision
to
treat
the
federal
government,
or
federal
employment
on
a
par
with
private
sector
employment.
you
emphasized
that,
but
i
didn't
see
the
connection
between
that
and
the
section
5
inquiry
that's
before
us.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
being
imposed
on
state
governments
that's
not
being
imposed
on
private
employers?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
with
respect
to
the
kinds
of
cases
that
we're
dealing
with,
with
employment,
there
are
money
damages
against
individuals.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
has...
mr.
gottesman,
has
any
court
bought
that
argument?
after
all,
there
is
the
garcia
case
to
deal
with,
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waxman,
is
it
really
rational
basis
review?
i
mean,
cleburne
does...
the
result
seems
at
odds
with
the...
with
just
anything
goes,
which
had
been
what
rational
basis
meant.
i
thought
that
the
cleburne
decision
was
very
much
like
reed
v.
reed
in
the
gender
area.
that
is,
the
court
purported
to
apply
rational
basis,
but
came
to
a
result
that
didn't
square
with
any
prior
rational
basis
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
how
do
you
explain
the
results?
i
mean,
one
could
conceive
of
many
bases
that
would
uphold
that
zoning
provision,
and
yet
the
court
not
only
didn't
attempt
to
justify
the
legislation,
but
held
the
legislation
to
a
rather
stringent
burden
of
justification.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
under
classic
rational
basis
review
the
court
was
not
only
to
listen
to
the
government's
argument,
but
if
there's
any
basis
it
could
conceive...
and
surely
there
were
bases
that
could
be
conceived--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
were
not
driven
by
animus--
