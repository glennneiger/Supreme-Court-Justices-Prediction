mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court--
in
enacting
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
in
1990,
congress
invoked
its
powers
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
and
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
do
not
challenge
congress'
authority
to
pass
the
ada
under
the
commerce
clause
and,
indeed,
doubt
anyone
ever
would
bring
such
an
across
the
board
attack
on
the
law,
yet
it
is
precisely
the
virtues
of
the
ada
as
a
matter
of
commerce
clause
legislation,
its
breadth
of
coverage,
its
exacting
accommodation
requirements,
that
make
it
unsustainable
as
a
section
5
law.
now,
before
this
court
has
authorized
congress
to
impose
extra
constitutional
duties
on
the
states,
it
has
required
the
congress
to
show
that
the
states
brought
this
loss
of
authority
upon
themselves
first
by
engaging
in
a
widespread
pattern
and
practice
of
unconstitutional
conduct
and,
second,
by
showing
that
the
remedial
legislation
is
proportionate
and
congruent
in
nature.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
they're
exceedingly
relevant,
and
they
certainly
sustain
the
ada
as
matter
of
commerce
clause
legislation,
but
just
as
with
kimel
and
the
age
laws
they
refer
only
to
discrimination
in
general.
they
don't
establish
constitutional
violations.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
there's
no
doubt
if
we
had
a
situation
where
congress
had
actually
identified
constitutional
violations
in
these
areas
of
state
control,
congress
would
have
section
5
authority.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
not
at
all,
your
honor.
there's
no
distinction
whatsoever
between
state,
city
and
county
when
it
comes
to
constitutional
violations.
it's
usually
just
local
government
and
state
government
generically
put
together,
but
the
key
point
is
in
the
ada
the
age
laws,
in
the
statement
of
purpose
and
findings,
it
was
exactly
the
same.
in
fact,
in
the
age--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
your
honor,
it
might
well
be
a
constitutional
violation,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
particular
allegation
was
won
by
just
one
side
of
the
dispute.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
the
first
problem,
your
honor,
is
that
it
wouldn't
be
a
remedial
section
5
problem
because,
if
those
allegations
are
true,
if
there's
no
rational
explanation
for
what
was
done
they
all
violate
state
law.
they
would...
all
50
states
by
19--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--but
your
honor,
the
risk
is
one
of
constitutional
violation.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
those
would
be
relevant
if
congress
had
made
a
second
finding,
which
is
just
critical
and
is
what
is
exactly
missing
here,
and
that
finding
had
been,
despite
this
conduct
by
states
in
local
areas
of
local
control,
the
states
weren't
enforcing
the
very
antidiscrimination
laws
they
had
on
the
books.
let's
draw
an
analogy
to
the
race
cases.
if
in
the
early
sixties
every
state
in
the
country
banned
literacy
tests,
all
right,
banned
the
very
thing
congress
was
trying
to
get
at,
it
would
not
be
enough
for
congress
to
say
literacy
tests
are
causing
problems.
they
would
have
to
make
a
second
showing
which
is,
the
states
are
not
enforcing
their
laws
on
the
books.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
in
the
early
sixties
they
would
have
been,
because
i
think
in
the
early
sixties
you
would
have
been
able
to
show
that
the
states,
those
were
shams.
they
were
statutory
potemkin
villages.
they
meant
nothing.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
there's
no
showing
on
that
front,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
there's
no...
congress
did
not
even
look
in
the
direction.
it's
true
they
looked
in
the
direction
of...
excuse
me.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
i
think
you've
got
two
possible
issues
there,
one
what
type
of
review,
would
that
be
a
rational
basis
setting,
or
because
it's
a--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--fundamental
right,
and
so
therefore
would
you
have
heightened
review.
i
think
there
would
be
situations
in
which
you
might
bring
a
constitutional
claim,
but...
and
i
hope
i'm
getting
to
your
point--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--i
don't
think
the
issue
would
be
changing
rational
basis
scrutiny.
the
issue
would
be
whether
it's
a
voting
rights
problem
which
gets
heightened
review,
but
your
honor,
the
key
point
on
voting,
access
to
courthouses
and
access
to
voting
booths,
the
ada
does
not
correct
that
problem.
to
the
extent
you
think
that
was
the
constitutional
problem
the
ada
was
getting
at,
it
exempted
all--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--mm
hmm.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
that--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--why
is
it
that
the
courts
have
more
authority
here
to
limit
that
type
of
state
conduct
than
congress?
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
your
honor,
i
think
if
it
were...
if
i
were
in
the
situation
where
i
was
saying
the
courts
had
more
remedial
authority
than
the
congress
i'd
have
a
real
problem,
because
of
course
that's
not
what's
going
on.
the
point
of
section
5
is
to
give
congress
remedial
authority.
but
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
on
the
courthouse
access
to
buildings
point
is
that
that's
not
something
the
ada
addresses.
the
congressional
record
shows
that
by
1990
every
state
in
the
country
had
an
architectural
barriers
law
that
precluded
the
building
of
new
buildings
that
didn't
have
access.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--i'm
not
willing
to
concede
that,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--i
don't,
your
honor
and
i
would,
in
fact,
point
the
court
to
alexander--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--absolutely,
and
there's
no
doubt
that's
what
they
were
referring
to.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
there's
not.
in
fact,
of
all
the
federal--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--it's
not,
and
there's
no
federal
civil
rights
statute--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
your
honor,
it's
a
challenge
to
the
ada
across
the
board.
there's
just
one
abrogation--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
if
there
were
only
arbitrary
justifications
for
a
decision--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--you
have
no
problem.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
there's
no
evidence,
your
honor,
that
there
are
any
such
state
laws--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--if
there
were...
no...
if
all
you
had
were
arbitrary
justifications
for
that
law,
of
course
you
would.
that's
city
of
cleburne,
and
that's
all
of
the
equal
protection
cases.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
if
this
court's--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--this
court
said
that
very
thing
in
a
case
involving
the
federal
government,
where
it
said
budgetary
constraints
alone
can
state
a
rational
basis.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
if
there--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--i
think
that
is
arbitrary,
and
i
think
that
would
be
a
problem.
the
question,
though,
is
whether
there
was
evidence
of
that
going
on
in
the
eighties,
number
1,
and
number
2,
were
state
laws
against
that
very
thing
not
being
enforced.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
oh,
there
can
be
a
federal
remedy,
and
that's
why
the
commerce
clause
legislation
is
fine.
the
question
is
whether
you
can
trump--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--the
tenth
or
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
because
the
very
point
of
section
5
is
to
correct
state
conduct
that
violates
the
constitution,
and
if
the
states
aren't
violating
the
constitution,
one--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--i
agree
entirely,
and
that's
why
one
has
to
look
at
whether
the
state
laws
are
being
enforced.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
yes,
and
i...
the
answer
is
yes,
but
i
just
want
to--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--no.
yes
to
the
first,
but
no
to
the
second.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
the
second
problem
with
the
ada
is,
it's
unlike
any
section
5
law
to
my
knowledge
ever
enacted,
and
certainly
ever
upheld
by
the
court,
in
the
sense
that
it
truly
is
a
constitutional
amendment
in
section
5
clothing.
it
applies
not
just
to
every
state,
but
every
form
of
government
service
that
ever
existed
or
ever
will
exist.
that
truly
is
evading
article
5
and
the
requirement
that
two
thirds
of
each
house
approve
a
constitutional
amendment
and,
most
importantly,
the
states,
three
fourths
of
them,
get
an
opportunity
to
change
it,
and
that's
exactly
what
would
happen,
and
that's
what
would
be
very
risky
about
allowing
that
hypothetical
to
justify
the
ada.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
we've
briefed
the
case
that
it
is
all
of
the
ada.
there's
just
one
abrogation
provision
that
applies
to,
you
know,
title
i,
title
ii,
and
title
iv,
so
i'm
not
sure
how
you
could
slice
it
that
we're
just
dealing
with
employment,
but
if,
your
honor,
we
were
dealing
with
employment,
and
you
had
justice
souter's
hypothetical,
200
instances,
just
employment,
states
refusing
to
enforce,
sure,
you
would
have
a
problem.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
i--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
i
assume,
justice
souter,
that's
what
you
were
saying.
yes.
i
mean,
absolutely.
but
my...
if
we're
going
to
talk
about
this
solely
as
an
employment
case,
which
is
fine
by
us,
we're
perfectly
agnostic
about
the
issue,
this
case
is
kimel.
i
mean,
it's
exactly
like
kimel.
it's
employment.
you've
got,
in
fact,
a
greater
gap
between
a
statutory
standard
and
a
constitutional
standard,
and
an
equally
anemic
record
when
it
comes
to
constitutional
violations.
i
mean,
even--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--yes,
your
honor.
it's
an
important
point.
there's
no
doubt
that
when
it
comes
to
run
of
the
mill
legislation,
city
of
cleburne
is
right.
we
need
that
authority
to
enact
these
50
state
laws
and
the
30
federal
laws
that
protect
the
rights
of
the
disabled,
so
there's
just
no
doubt
about
that
at
all.
but
in
the
section
5
context
you've
got
two
other
issues,
the
relationship
between
this
court
and
its
final
marbury
power
and
the
relationship
between
the
congress
and
the
states,
and
that's
why
the
section
5
inquiries
are
always
different.
you've
got
a
zero
sum
game.
congress'
gain
is
invariably
the
state's
loss,
and
just
as
congress
gets
a
presumption
of
constitutionality
in
enacting
these
30
federal
disability
laws,
so
do
the
states
get
a
presumption
of
constitutionality
that
when
they
pass
these
50
state
laws,
1)
they're
presumptively
good
and
2)
they're
enforcing
them.
now,
that
can...
you
know,
that's
not
dispositive,
of
course.
ultimately,
if
it
turns
out
the
states
aren't
enforcing
them,
they're
just
shams,
well
then
they're
got
a
problem
and,
you
know,
that's
why
the
voting
rights
laws
are--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
i
hope
i'm
answering
both
questions.
if
one
is
concerned
about
the
institutional
capacity
of
the
courts
versus
congress
in
this
area,
the
last
thing
this
court
should
be
doing
in
this
case
is
making
ultimately
these
section
5
findings
itself,
okay.
so
if
you're
going
to
agree
with
justice
breyer
and
the
suggestion
in
your
question,
justice
souter,
that
there
has
to
be
a
little
more
deference
to
congress
in
this
area,
the
last
thing
the
court
should
be
doing
is
in
a
situation
where
they
don't
ask
the
right
questions,
constitutional
violations
as
opposed
to
violating
a
statutory
standard,
number
1,
number
2,
are
the
state
laws,
all
50
of
them
on
the
books
being
enforced,
the
last
thing
anyone's--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--because,
your
honor,
it's
not
easy
being
the
supreme
court
and
deciding
what
the
constitution
means
in
all
these
cases,
but
the
bottom
line
is
the
marbury
power
rests
here
in
this
building.
it
doesn't
rest
anywhere
else,
and
clever
arguments
about
how
congress
needs
more
deference
to
find
out
when
constitutional
violations
really
exist
is
just
a
nice
way,
a
polite
way
of
putting
the
fact
that
they
across
the
street
get
to
decide
what
the
constitution
means.
i
don't
know
how
else
to
divide
it,
but
that
is
what's
going
on,
if
they
can
enact
a
law
that
applies
to
every
government
services--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--it
is
a
finding,
it's
entitled
to
deference,
and
it
applies
to
the
commerce
clause
article
i
justification
for
passing
this
law.
that
does
not
suffice
to
show
there
are
constitutional
violations,
and
certainly--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--absolutely.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
absolutely.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
no,
it
does
not
and
i
invite
everyone
to
read
it.
that's
exactly
what's
going
on.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
i
hope...
i'm
fearful
that
i'm
not...
i
didn't
hear
the
question,
but
let
me
try
to
answer.
you
can
cut
me
off
as
soon
as
it
appears
i
didn't
hear
what
you
were
saying.
but
they've
got
to
be
constitutional
violations,
your
honor,
and
if
they're
not
constitutional
violations,
they
haven't
asked
the
right
question.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
that's
not
the
question
they
were
asking.
the
question
they
were
asking
is
precisely
the
one
justice
scalia
asked,
which
is,
isn't...
is
this
adequate,
can
we
do
a
better
job.
of
course
we
can
do
a
better
job.
you
know,
i
think
in
1985
the
court
issued
two
decisions
which
seemed
to
me
to
get
right
to
the
heart
of
the
matter.
not
only
was
it--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--i've
no
idea,
your
honor.
i've
looked
through
the--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
that
doesn't
follow
necessarily
at
all.
i
mean,
one
you
could
have
an
abrogation
provision,
and
states
are
free
to
waive
on
their
own.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
no,
until
7
years
afterwards,
that's
exactly
right,
but
i've
looked
to
the
congressional
record
trying
to
find
instances
where
congress
was
aware
of
the
section
5
inquiry.
i
found
two.
one
of
them
cites
fullilove,
representative
dellums
saying
there's
a
broad
section
5
power.
fullilove
is
no
longer
good
law.
the
second
cites
morgan
v.
katzenbach
and
just
has
a
sentence
that
says,
embracing
the
broader
version
of
morgan
saying
that
if
there's
an
antidiscrimination
issue
out
there,
congress
can
remedy
under
section
5,
but
that's
not
the
inquiry,
and
as
early
as
1970
it
was
clear
that
was
not
the
inquiry
in
oregon
v.
mitchell,
when
the
court
invalidated
congress'
effort
to
lower
the
voting
age
from
21
to
18
in
all
states
in
the
country.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
yes,
your
honor.
it
goes
to
the
second
question,
not
the
record
issue
but
the
proportionality
issue.
congress
purported
to
be
remedying,
in
their
words,
a
national
epidemic
regarding
disability
discrimination,
and
they
decided
that
in
order
to
do
that
you
needed
money
damages
actions,
which
is
really
all
that
is
at
stake
here
in
light
of
ex
parte
young.
how
can
they
say
that
it's
a
proportionate
and
necessary
tailored
remedy
when
they're
not
only
not
imposing
it
on
private
business
in
many
instances,
but
on
themselves?
that
just
doesn't
stand.
it's
not
only
the
failure
to
lead
by
example,
just
direction,
but
it
doesn't
show
proportionality.
i
mean,
it
proves
our
very
point.
this
was
not
needed.
it's
not
proportionate
to
the
very
problem
they
were
trying
to
correct.

money

requirement.
title
ii
applies
to
any
form
of
discrimination
plus
access
to
public
services.
under
title
iii
those
provisions,
most
of
those
provisions
are
extended
to
private
businesses,
and
there
are
no
money
damages
remedies
there,
which
really
proves
the
difference
between
the
state's
ability
to
lobby,
and
private
businesses.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
that's
true,
your
honor.
i
mean,
again...
but
if
this
is
an
employment
case,
which
is
fine
by
us,
it
really
is
controlled
by
kimel,
because
the
gap
between
the
statutory
standard
and
the
constitutional
standard
is
even
broader
in
this
case
than
it
was
in
kimel,
and
then--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--this
court
has
never
found
one
against
employment,
your
honor.
if
we're
going
to
stick
with
employment,
there
are
none
with
respect
to
employment,
zero.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
i
suspect,
your
honor,
if
we
reviewed
all
of
the
court's
constitutional
findings
there
would
be
cases
in
which
an
elderly
person
was
a
plaintiff
and
won
a
constitutional
case.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
i
think
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
i
mean,
if
you
can
remedy
constitutional
violations
in
one
area
by
transferring
it
to
another
area,
then
we
really
should
talk
about
the
entire
ada,
and
talk
about
its
biggest
flaw.
its
biggest
flaw
that
it
is
a
section...
it
is
a
constitutional
amendment
in
section
5
clothing.
it
applies
to
every
single
form
of
government
service,
and
if
they're
allowed
to
do
this,
they'll
do
it
in
every
area,
rational
basis
scrutiny
of
all
sorts.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
it's
certainly
possible,
your
honor,
and
one
of
the
best
things
i
think
that
can
be
done
here
is,
instead
of
the
court
having
to
engage
in
this
section
5
inquiry
on
the
basis
of
the
government
lawyers
after
the
fact,
let
them
do
it
again.
but
i
will
suggest
this,
your
honor.
it
is
not
going
to
be
as
easy
as
one
submits
to
say--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--no,
your
honor.
no,
your
honor,
not
at
all.
the
ada
would
be
invalid.
12202,
section
12202
would
be
invalid,
and
it
would
be
up
to
them
to
decide
what
they
wanted
to
do.
in
fact,
in
city
of
boerne
this
court
invalidated
the
rfra.
they're
back
at
it
again.
they're
entitled
to
do
that.
i
will
submit
that
there
is
a
bright
line
here.
it's
constitutional
violations.
u.s.
senators,
u.s.
house
of
representatives
members
are
not
going
to
lightly
find
states
are
violating
the
constitution,
but
we
want
them
to
ask
that
question.
that's
the
very
point
of
section
5.
we
want
them
to
look
out,
root
out
this
type
of
invidious
discrimination,
and
if
it's
going
on,
have
them
ask
the
right
question,
identify
it,
and
end
it.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
it
certainly
helps
our
case
and
it
makes
it
a
lot
easier,
but
to
be
candid
with
you,
if
they
imposed
this
same
remedy
on
the
federal
government,
i
think
they
would
still
have
problem,
precisely
because
it
applies
to
every
government
service,
but
it
just
makes
it--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--not
in
this
case,
your
honor.
the
breadth
of
coverage
and
the
gap
between
the
statutory
and
constitutional
standards
are
enough
in
this
case.
if
i
could
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
thank
you.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
three
brief
points,
your
honor.
i
certainly
hope
city
of
cleburne
applied
rational
basis,
because
if
it
didn't
the
ada
has
many
constitutional
problems.
if
the...
if
in
the
area
of
discrimination
against
the
disabled
you
apply
heightened
review,
just
consider
the
very
problem
of
defining
who
is
disabled
and
who
is
not
under
the
law.
you're
going
to
have
underinclusiveness
and
overinclusiveness
problems
that
would
never
survive
heightened
review,
so
let's
hope
it's
rational
basis
scrutiny.
that
was
the
very
point
of
the
law.
second,
i've
not
heard
anything
today
from
the
other
side--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--your
honor,
i
would
disagree
respectfully.
when
a
government
lawyer
comes
before
a
court,
whether
at
the
trial
level
or
this
court,
and
offers
five
explanations
for
a
law
that
they
all
say
are
rational,
it
turns
out
they're
not,
they're
irrational
and
driven
by
animus,
they
lose.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
i--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--to
be
honest
with
you,
i've
never...
i'm
not
aware
that
that
is
the
court's
rule,
that
the
court's
job
is
to
conceive
of
rational
basis.
i
always
thought
that
was
the
job
of
the
government
lawyer
to
come
before
the
court...
the
inquiry
is
not
exactly
what
the
government
did.
it's
whether
there's
any
rational
explanation
after
the
fact.
and,
as
this
court's
decisions
prove,
there
are
probably
a
dozen
to
two
dozen
of
them.
there
are
some
instances
where
they
can't
come
up
with
anything,
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
there.
whether
it
was
good
lawyering,
bad
lawyering,
the
end
result,
everything
they
identified
was
not
rational.
the
second
thing,
i've
not
heard
anything
from
the
government
or
the
private
respondents
in
their
briefs
or
today
about
the
second
half
of
the
city
of
boerne
inquiry.
there's
nothing
about
proportionality
and,
as
the
court
said
in
kimel,
florida
prepaid,
and
city
of
boerne
itself,
the
issue
on
proportionality
is
whether
the
statutory
standard
covers,
quote,
substantially
more
conduct
than
would
be
found
unconstitutional.
that
itself
invalidates
this
law.
now,
the
question
of
discrimination,
whether
it
exists
at
the
society
or
the
government
level,
i
think
this
court's
decisions
from
1985,
one
of
them
written,
by
the
way,
by
justice
marshall
in
alexander
v.
choate,
justice
marshall
says
in
a
9-0
decision,
the
main
problem
with
disability
discrimination
is
not
one
of
intent.
it's
one
of
either
trying
too
hard,
needless
paternalism,
or
not
trying
hard
enough,
unintentional
neglect.
that's
the
problem.
that's
an
article
i
problem,
and
we're
happy
the
ada
was
enacted.
the
only
challenges
that
have
been
made
to
it
to
our
knowledge
are
in
the
prison
setting,
and
it's
about
inmates
and,
if
there's
one
area
where
maybe
interstate
commerce
doesn't
go,
it's
to
a
prison,
where
the
very
point
of
a
prison
is
to
keep
people
out
of
interstate
commerce,
so--
[laughter]
and
i
don't
think
that's
a
very
good
example.
unless
there
are
any
other
questions--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--i
understand
exactly
what
you're
saying,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
but
to
apply
the
test
you're
suggesting
is
one
that
requires
the
overruling
of
city
of
boerne.
the
very
point
of
city
of
boerne--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--no,
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
that's
just
the
power
to
use
section
5
to
redefine
section
1,
and
that
is
what
city
of
boerne
says,
and
that's
what
kimel
says,
also
a
rational
basis
case.
but
at
the
most,
your
honor,
if
you're
going
to
talk
about
individual
decisions
by
government
officials,
that's
why
you
need
a
pattern
and
practice.
it's
a
very
big
distinction
between
individual
officials
doing
something
and
state
laws
that
discriminate
invidiously.
that's
the
voting
rights
act
cases,
versus
city
of
boerne,
versus
kimel.
thank
you,
your
honor.
