chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
99-1240,
the
board
of
trustees
of
the
university
of
alabama
v.
patricia
garrett.
mr.
sutton.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
findings
distinguish
at
all
between
discrimination
that
was
the
result
of
the
state
as
opposed
to,
say,
the
county
or
the
city?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
justice
stevens'
hypothesis,
a
man
with
an
artificial
limb
turned
down
for
a
teacher,
just
without
any
real
basis
for
it,
you
know,
we're
just
afraid
we
might
not
be
able
to
handle
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
would
be
arbitrary.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
would
want
to
know,
wouldn't
you,
mr.
sutton,
whether
these
200
instances
were,
quote,
discrimination,
close
quote,
in
the
sense
that
congress
used
it,
or
discrimination
in
the
sense
that
it's
used
in
the
city
of
cleburne--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--as
that's
different.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
seminole
wasn't
decided
until
1997.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
mr.
sutton.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gottesman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--this
would
be
an
argument
that
could
be
made
only
by
the
state,
not
by
a
county
or
a
city,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let's
not
talk
about
state
action
for
a
minute,
mr.
gottesman.
let's
talk
about
the
states
and
the
eleventh
amendment
section.
what
findings
did
congress
make,
what
examples
did
it
use
to
tie
in
the
states
with
this
sort
of
irrational
discrimination?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
people
who
were
acting
for
the
state?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
may
answer,
mr.
gottesman,
briefly.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gottesman.
general
waxman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
waxman,
do
you
agree
with
mr.
gottesman
that
if
the...
supposing
there
emerged
a
55-year
retirement
law,
rational
basis,
relied
on
in
kimel,
do
you
agree
with
mr.
gottesman's
suggestion
that
if
a
court
could
be
persuaded
that
when
the
legislature
acted,
that
they
really
had
it
in
for
people
over
55,
that
that
would
be
invalid?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
now,
i
don't
want
to
put
words
in
mr.
gottesman's
mouth,
but
i
understood
him
to
say
that
sure,
rational
basis,
but
if
you
could
prove
that
although
there
was
a
rational
basis
for
requiring
people
to
retire
at
55,
if
the
legislature
that
enacted
that
had
really
been
motivated
by
a
dislike
for
people
over
55,
then
it
would...
there
would
be
a
violation
of
equal
protection.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
in
the
process
of
answering
my
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
no,
no.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
agree
with
mr.
gottesman?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
said
the
same
thing
in
kimel.
we
said,
rational
basis
scrutiny,
much
legislative
latitude.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
now,
general
waxman,
are
we
then
to
look
through
separate
opinions,
dissenting
opinions,
and
say
if
the
majority
didn't
contradict
them
they
must
have
been
subscribed
to
by
the
whole
court?
we've
never
done
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
surprised
that
you
would
simply
cite
an
opinion
like
that,
as
if...
unless
the
majority
said,
gee,
we
don't
agree
with
that
statement,
it
suggests
the
majority
did
agree
with
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you
were
citing
was
justice
marshall's
opinion,
and
are
you
saying
that
congress
could
rely
on
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
one...
congress
could
make
its
record,
i
take
it,
out
of
statements
in
dissenting
opinions
from
this
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
waxman.
mr.
sutton,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sutton.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sutton.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
two
cases
to
announce:
the
first
99-1240,
the
board
of
trustees
of
the
university
of
alabama
versus
garrett.
and
here
patricia
garrett
was
employed
as
a
registered
nurse
by
the
university
of
alabama
in
birmingham
hospital.
she
was
diagnosed
with
breast
cancer
in
1994
and
transferred
to
a
lower
paying
position
in
the
hospital.
milton
ash
worked
as
a
security
officer
for
the
alabama
department
of
youth
services.
he
suffered
from
chronic
asthma
and
sleep
apnea
and
he
requested
but
was
denied
various
workplace
accommodations
related
to
these
conditions.
in
separate
lawsuits
garrett
and
ash
sued
their
state
employers
in
federal
district
court
under
the
americans
with
disabilities
act.
the
district
court
dismissed
both
cases
on
the
ground
that
the
eleventh
amendment
of
the
constitution
forbids
such
suits
in
federal
court
for
money
damages
against
the
state.
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
reverse
concluding
their
congress
had
abrogated
that
immunity
in
enacting
ada
pursuant
to
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse
that
decision.
our
decisions
have
established
that
a
non-consenting
state
cannot
be
sued
for
money
damages
in
federal
court
unless
the
suit
is
authorized
by
validly
enacted
congressional
legislation.
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
allows
congress
to
enforce
the
substantive
guarantees
found
in
section
1
of
that
amendment
but
congress
must
not
change
the
substance
of
section
1’s
protections
by
passing
enforcement
legislation.
in
our
case
decided
a
few
years
ago
the
city
of
boerne
against
flores,
we
explained
that
section
5
legislation
if
it
extends
beyond
the
scope
of
section
1’s
guarantees,
as
set
forth
by
this
court,
must
be
congruent
and
proportional
to
the
underlying
constitutional
right
congress
seeks
to
protect.
and
so
far
as
it
was
applied
to
state
employment
title
i
of
the
ada
fails
this
test.
in
cleburne
v.
cleburne
living
center,
we
concluded
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
provides
that
state
action
regarding
the
disabled
that
is
supported
by
a
rational-basis
does
not
run
afoul
of
the
constitution.
it
is
clear
that
in
enacting
the
ada
congress
was
not
responding
to
a
documented
pattern
of
irrational
state
employment
discrimination
against
the
disabled.
in
fact,
there
is
strong
evidence
that
the
drafters
of
title
i
of
the
ada
were
concerned
primarily
with
employment
discrimination
in
the
private
sector.
even
if
congress
did
perceive
some
problem
in
state
employment
practices
the
ada
prohibits
so
much
more
than
mere
irrational
behavior
that
the
statute
in
effect
rewrites
the
substance
of
the
fourteenth
amendment's
protections.
application
of
the
ada
to
the
states
thus
does
not
properly
rest
upon
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
there
is
no
basis
for
waiving
the
state’s
eleventh
amendment
immunity
from
damages
actions
in
federal
court.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
joined
by
justice
o’conner;
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens,
souter
and
ginsburg
joined.
