justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
sutton,
there
were
congressional
findings
that
there
has
been
discrimination
against
the
disabled
in
voting,
health
services,
transportation,
education,
and
so
on,
and
there
are
numerous
examples
in
the
legislative
record,
and
those
are
areas
of
traditional
state
control.
do
you
think
that
those
findings
are
somehow
false,
or
not
relevant
in
some
way,
or
that
the
discrimination
is
just
not
unconstitutional,
or
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
press
you
on
a
little
bit,
because
the
findings
in
some
instances
are
in
areas
that
are
under
traditional
state
control.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
gottesman,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
record
here
presents
much
in
the
way
of
a
title
ii
claim.
i
know
the
ninth
circuit
has
said
that
all
employment
disputes
under
the
ada
are
covered
only
by
title
i,
not
title
ii,
that
title
ii
addresses
public
services,
and
i
know
the
grant
of
certiorari
covered
both,
ostensibly,
because
the
plaintiffs'
cause
of
action
appeared
to
address
both,
and
i
think
this
court
probably
hasn't
decided
whether
all
employment
cases
fall
under
title
i,
but
if
we
thought
they
did,
do
we
have
to
address
the
title
ii
issue?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
it
provided
rational
basis
as
the
foundation
of
review
in
cleburne?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
something
more?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
congress
can
by
law
establish
that
the
disabled
are
a
discrete
minority
entitled
to
heightened
scrutiny
in
reviewing
legislation,
or
action
by
states?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
think
congress
can
do
that?
