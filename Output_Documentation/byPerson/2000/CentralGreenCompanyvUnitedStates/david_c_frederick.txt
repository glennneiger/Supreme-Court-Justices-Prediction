mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
multiple
purpose
projects
throughout
the
country
operate
like
the
friant
division
of
the
central
valley
project,
which
collects
water
behind
friant
dam
to
avert
flooding
along
the
san
joaquin
river
and
then
gradually
releases
that
water
to
serve
both
flood
control
and
irrigation
needs.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
o'connor,
we
don't
know
why--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
you
focus
on
what
the
reality
is.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
serves
multiple
purposes,
justice
o'connor.
the
water
that
is
released
into
the
madera
canal
for
10
months
out
of
every
year
has
to
comply
with
flood
control
rules
set
by
the
corps
of
engineers.
the
bureau
of
reclamation
cannot
release
that
water,
and
it
must
make
daily
decisions
about
how
much
water
goes
into
the
canal,
and
which
canal
it
goes
into,
and
whether
it
goes
in
the
downstream
river,
and
for
that
reason--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--wrong.
that
is--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that
is
incorrect.
what
the
agreement
says
is
that
the
government
can
put
water
into
the
canal,
and
it
can
be
flood
water,
and
even
the
water
that
the
irrigators
take
and
use
for
irrigation
can
serve
flood
control
reasons
if
it
has
to
be
released
from
millerton
lake
to
avert
a
flood,
or
if
putting
that
water
down
the
san
joaquin
river
would
cause
a
flood,
the
dam
operator
diverts
it
into
the
irrigation
canals--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that
would
be--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
first,
the
fact
that
they
have
asserted
in
their
complaint
that
it
serves
an
irrigation
purpose
is
not
legally
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
sovereign
immunity
applies,
because
sovereign
immunity
is
jurisdictional,
and
the
court
must
satisfy
itself
that
it
has
jurisdiction--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
there's
any
way
that
the
plaintiffs
could
show
that
in
this
case.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
o'connor,
congress,
when
it
created
this
project
in
the
1930's,
was
facing
a
fact
that
between
1900
and
1944
there
were
38
devastating
floods
along
the
san
joaquin
river,
and
it,
in
the
course
of
its
legislative
fact-finding,
determined
that
the
way
to
deal
with
flooding
along
this
river
was
to
harness
that
river
and
then
to
put
it
to
productive
use.
of
those
38
floods,
15
were
from
rain
during
the
period
between
october
1
and
roughly
march
15,
23
from
snow
melt
run-off--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--we
do
defend--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
justice--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
we
disagree
with
that.
the
1937
rivers
and
harbors
act
said
the
entire
central
valley
project
is
for,
among
other
purposes,
flood
control.
it's
undisputed
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
kennedy,
and
the
reason
is
the
congressional
design
behind
the
project,
as
one
of
your
earlier
questions
pointed
out,
it
is
an
integrated
project,
and
the
part
of
the
report
that
you
were
talking
about,
if
all
parties
agree,
those
parties
are
the
bureau
of
reclamation
and
the
corps
of
engineers.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
way,
mr.
chief
justice,
courts
have
consistently
looked
at
the
question
of
what
is
a
flood
water
is,
is
that
water
that
would
overflow
the
banks
unless
controlled
by
man-made
structures,
and
that
was
the
assumption
that
the
court
in
james
made
behind
having
the
water
behind
this
dam
be
deemed
flood
waters.
if
the
waters
not
controlled
by
that
dam
would
overflow
the
river,
then
it
would
be
deemed
flood
waters
and
that's--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
our
submission,
justice
breyer,
is
that
the...
first
we
can
show
as
a
matter
of
historical
fact
that
that's
not
the
case
here,
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
our
brief
demonstrates
that
even
if
you
take
class
i
water
out
of
the
picture,
and
class
i
water
in
many
circumstances
would
have
to
be
released
for
flood
storage
reasons--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
breyer,
a
flood
control
project
is
created
for
the
cataclysm.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
breyer,
to
answer
your
question,
one
must
look
at
the
flood
rules
that
are
set
down
by
the
corps
of
engineers
with
respect
to
this
project.
they
were
set
out
in
1955,
and--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
you...
the
congress
didn't
define
the
term,
flood
waters,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
court
in
james
defined
the
term
flood
waters
in
section
702(c),
but
what
the
corps
of
engineers
has
done
in
flood
control
projects
is
to
set
out
the
rules
for
how
those
projects
operate
so
that
waters
do
not
become
floods,
and
in
the
establishment
of
those
rules
the
corps
made
very
clear
that
water
has
to
be
diverted
from
millerton
lake
to
the
canals
that
are
adjoining
the
dam
so
that
flooding--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--to
the
contrary,
mr.
chief
justice,
for
sovereign
immunity
to
be
a
functional
principle,
the
government
should
be
entitled
to
go
into
court
to
say
congress
and
the
applicable
agencies
have
designed
and
operated
this
facility
for
flood
control
reasons
and
avoid--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--to
the
contrary,
justice
o'connor.
the
entire
central
valley
project
uses
aqueducts
and
canals--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--okay.
let
me
see
if
i
can
help,
then.
in
james
what
the
court
said
was
that
flood
waters
within
the
meaning
of
the
immunity
statute
is
all
waters
carried
in
or
contained
through
a
flood
control
project
for
purposes
of
or
related
to
flood
control.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
we
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor,
for
this
reason.
on
an
average
year,
millerton
lake
will
have
1.7
million
acre
feet
of
run-off
into
it.
that's
the
average
year.
it
has
to
empty
itself,
or
it
has
to
be
emptied,
and
then
it
will
refill
three-and-a-half
times
during
the
course
of
the
year.
if
that
water
is
not
released
there
will
be
a
flood.
if
it's
not
controlled,
there
will
be
a
flood
along
the
san
joaquin
river.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
the
fact
that
there
is
a
multiple
benefit,
and
the
hydropower
is
another
benefit,
does
not
mean
that
the
water
loses
its
character
as
flood
water
if
it
is
stored
to
protect
against
a
flood
along
the
river,
and
what...
in
james
this
court
considered
the
question
of
flood
waters
that
were
being
used
for
recreational
purposes.
the
specific
discharge
that
was
at
issue
in
that
case
was
deemed
to
be
for
flood
control
reasons.
but
here,
the
same
principle
applies
because
the
water
is
released
into
the
irrigation
canals
for
a
flood
control
purpose.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
to
the
contrary.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
because
every
release
from
millerton
lake
has
to
serve
a
flood
control
purpose,
number
1.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
breyer,
if
i
could
answer
your
question
in
two
ways.
the
first
is,
if
this
complaint
alleged
a
discrete
release
of
water,
there
might
be
an
argument
that
the
government
was
not
entitled
to
immunity
under
your
theory
because
the
discrete
purpose
of
the
release
could
be
identified.
but
this
complaint
asserts
that
this
canal
has
leaked,
and
on
page
54
of
the
joint
appendix
they
say,
we
don't
know
when
the
leaking
started,
so
you
have
to
look
at
the
overall
purposes
of
the
project,
and
you
have
to
look
at
the
reasons
why
water
gets
released
from
friant
dam.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
my--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--okay.
my
comment
is
that
if
you're
looking
at
why
congress
would
have
put
billions
of
dollars
into
these
water
projects,
it
did
so
with
the
assumption
that
the
immunity
would
apply,
and
that
is
a
very
important
principle
here,
because
when
establishing
sovereign
immunity
principles
you
don't
allow
the
government
to
be
engaged
in
fact-finding.
they've
asked
for
every
single
document
relating
to
this
project
since
the
1930's
as
part
of
their
discovery
effort.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
because
this
is
property
damage,
justice
stevens.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it...
the
court--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--in
1936,
when
congress
directed
the
corps
of
engineers
in
the
flood
control
act
of
1936
to
study
the
san
joaquin
river
and
figure
out
a
way
to
stop
flooding
on
the
san
joaquin
river,
it
incorporated
by
reference
the
1928
flood
act
which
contains
the
immunity
provision
in
this
case.
in
1937,
congress
then
authorized--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
no,
but
the
case
of
united
states
v.
cress
had
been
in
present...
by...
decided
by
this
court,
and
the
question
of
whether
or
not
and
when
flooding
would
constitute
a
taking.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
so
the
issue
was
very
much
how
will
congress
protect
the
government
from
paying
out
in
lawsuits
for
faulty
structures
or
negligent
design
or
damage
from
flood
waters,
you
know,
for
decades
out
into
the
future,
and
the
interrelationship
between
the
flood
control
purpose
and
irrigation
is
probably
the
most
important
thing
that
we
would
like
the
court
to
understand
here,
because
you
cannot
segregate
the
purposes.
they're
all
serving
these
purposes
simultaneously.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
when,
in
an
accident--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
discrete
situation.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
first
it
would
be--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--first,
it
would
be
an
unusual
way
to
treat
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
courts,
on
an
apportionment
basis.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
when
you
were
talking
about
the
project
itself
and
how
the
project--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
i--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
souter--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
the
reason
is
that
congress
wanted
there
to
be
broad
immunity.
it
drafted
this
statute
in
the
broadest
possible--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
i...
no,
justice
souter,
i
think
there
ought
to
be
a
discrete...
i
think
conceptually
there
are
two
different
problems
dealing
with
this
statute.
james
dealt
with
the
conceptual
problem
of
an
accident
occurring
in
flood
waters
within
a
project
and
is
there
a
relationship
between
the
accident
that
occurs
and
the
flood
control
purpose
of
the
project,
and
what
the
court
there
said
was,
if
it...
if
the
accident
is
related
to
the
purposes
of
the
flood
control
project,
the
immunity
applies.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
this--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--this
problem,
justice
souter,
is
really
at
the
core
of
what
congress
was
getting
at
in
1928
which
is,
we're
going
to
pour
billions
of
dollars
into
building
these
structures
to
protect
flood
water,
and
we--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
but
mr.
chief
justice,
when
congress
created
the
extensive
levee
system
it
spent
four
times
the
amount
that
it
had
on
the
panama
canal,
and
it
also
appropriated
money
in
the
1928
act
to
put
dams
on
the
sacramento
river
and
to
protect
against
flooding
on
the
sacramento
river,
which
is
integrated
in
the
water
system
with
the
san
joaquin
river.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
scalia,
first
the
court
took
a
different
view
in
james,
and
that
view
is
certainly--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
those
waters
were
captured
behind
the
dam,
and
they
were
being
released
to
create
more
flood
storage
space
in
that
lake,
just
as
here,
the
waters
released
into
the
irrigation
canals
to
create
more
flood
storage
space--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
david
c.
frederick
we
can
because
in...
the
way
the
project
was
designed,
in
1944
the
corps
of
engineers
reported
back
to
congress
and
it
said
that
if
more
than
7,000
cubic
feet
per
second
of
water
is
released
into
the
san
joaquin
river
there
will
be
a
flood
at
skagg's
branch,
and
it
also
said
the
flood
capacity
of
the
dam
is
12,000
cubic
feet
per
second,
and
if
you
add
1,000
for
the
madera
canal
and
4,000
for
the
friant
current
canal,
it
is
unmistakably
clear
the
corps
of
engineers
intended
for
these
canals
to
receive
the
flood
waters.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
breyer--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--as
a
factual
matter--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--4
out
of
the
last
5
years,
if
the
water
had
not
been
put
into
the
canals,
there
would
have
been
flooding
on
the
san
joaquin
river.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
through
some
months.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--through
months-long
periods.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
related
to
flood
control--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--because
they
are
making
space
so
that
floods
don't
occur
in
those
months.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
water's
left
the
federal
project.
it's...
that's--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes,
and--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--right,
but
in
your
hypothetical
the
madera
district
is
operating
those
cut-off
valves.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
okay.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
then
there
would
be--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
that
would
be
immunity.
i
mean,
if
the
government's
actions
are
negligent
in
releasing
the
water,
the
immunity
applies.
the
statute
says--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
yes.
that's
water
that's
inundating
an
area
where
it
is
not
supposed
to
be.
that's
the
definition
of
a
flood.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
inundating
an
area
where
the
water
is
not
supposed
to
be.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
we
do.
[laughter]
we
think
we
do,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
there's
no
difference
in
our
view
from
an
overflow
and
a
leak
if
the
structure
isn't
working
properly--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes,
and
every
court
of
appeals
has
so
held.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
if
the
project
is
a
flood
control
project
and
there
is
a
relation
to
flood
control,
the
courts
have
upheld
the
government's
immunity.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
and
that
would
be--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--where
a
government
official
like
a
fish
&
wildlife
service
official
is
on
a
flood
control
facility,
commits
an
act
of
negligence
that
causes
a
person
to
drown--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that
would
not
be
covered
by
the
immunity.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it...
arguably,
yes.
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
justice
stevens,
let
me
just
say
that
the
ninth
circuit
itself
is
not
wholly
consistent
on
this
point.
in
the
mccarthy
case,
which
was
a
personal
negligence
case,
the
ninth
circuit
said
there
must
be
a
substantial
factor
between
the
government's
activities
and
the
accident,
so
even
in
the
mccarthy
case
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
strictly
hew
to
its
wholly-unrelated
standard.
but
i
would
point
out--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
the
immunity
would
apply
to
negligence
cases,
too,
justice
souter,
for
precisely--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--for
precisely
the
same
reason.
that's
flood
water--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
let
me
distinguish
between--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
escaping
waters
cases,
which
is
what
this
one
is.
this
water
is
not
where
it's
supposed
to
be.
it
has
escaped
from
the
project.
congress
built
the
project
to
keep
the
water
contained,
and
that
project
is--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--collectively
failing,
is
foursquare
within
what
congress
debated
in
the
1928
act.
it
wanted
these
structures
to
succeed,
but
it
did
not
want
the
government
to
have
to
defend
lawsuits
like
this
one
for
time
immemorial
if
they
did
not.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
breyer,
i
conceded
that
if
you
were
not
to
accept
our
broad
view
of
every
release
being
for
flood
control,
that
you
would
then
look
at
whether
or
not
there
was
a
relation
between
the
release
and
flood
control
activities.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
i
mean--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct.
it
is
a
totally
integrated
system,
but
justice
breyer,
if
you
were
not
to
accept
our
broadest
submission,
even
under
our
narrower
submission
we
should
prevail
and
get
immunity
in
this
case,
because
it
can
be
shown
through
contracts,
through
regulations,
through
statutes
that
this
canal
serves
and
is
related
to
a
flood
control
purpose,
and
the
empirical
water
data
collected
by
the
u.s.
geological
service
that
we
quoted
in
our
brief
indicates
that
well
over
half
of
the
water
released
in
the
last
20
years
undoubtedly
serves
a
flood
control
purpose.
i
mean,
you
know--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
this
was
done
on
the
pleadings,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
we
are
allowed
to
defend
the
judgment
on
an
alternate
ground
and
to
provide
public
record
material--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
in
a
way
this
is
and
this
is
not
an
alternate
ground.
it
is
support
for
the
judgment
and
the
rationale
for
the
judgment
by
showing
the
relation
of
flood
control
in
this
particular
project,
and
we
have--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--not
when
they're
legal
sources,
justice
ginsburg.
this
is
the
statutes.
this
is
the
regulations.
this
is
historical
public
record
material.
this
is
stipulations
they
have
agreed
to
in
the
stipulations
of
fact.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
you
don't
need
to
understand
all
the
terms
of
the
contract
to
get
the
central
point,
which
is
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
justice
stevens.
what
we
want
you
to
know
is
that
the
contract
provides
for
flood
water
to
be
put
into
the
madera
canal,
and
therefore
it
serves
a
flood
control
purpose.
that's
all
you
really
need
to
understand
about
the
contract,
because
it
is
a
matter
that
they've
stipulated
to,
this
is
how
the
water
gets
into
the
canal,
and
the
parties
have
agreed
that
flood
water
will
be
put
into
the
canal
as
a
matter
of
agreement.
so
when
you
look,
justice
ginsburg,
at
the
sources
that
we
have
relied
upon
to
defend
the
judgment
and
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals,
there
is
not
anything
that
would
be
developed
by
going
back.
all
that
would
be
accomplished
is
that
the
government
would
be
forced
to
defend,
you
know,
document
requests
that
called
for
every
scrap
of
paper
in
the
central
valley
project
and
in
the
madera
canal
over
the
last
65
years,
and
the
question
of
sovereign
immunity
would
not
be
one
that
could
be
established
at
the
pleadings
stage.
it
would,
in
fact,
be
subject
to
proof
at
every
step
of
the
way,
and
this
court
has
made
clear
that
not
only
is
sovereign
immunity
a
principle
of
jurisdiction,
but
it...
to
prevent
against
the
government
being
liable,
but
it's
also
a
principle
to
avoid
the
government
having
to
defend
against
vexatious
litigation.
