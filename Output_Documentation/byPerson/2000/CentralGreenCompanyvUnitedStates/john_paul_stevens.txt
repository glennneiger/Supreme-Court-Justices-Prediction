the
madera
canal,
a
federal
facility
leased
to
the
madera
irrigation
district,
flows
through
petitioner's
california
orchards.
petitioner
brought
suit
against
the
united
states
and
the
district
alleging
that
their
negligence
in
designing,
constructing,
and
maintaining
the
canal
caused
subsurface
flooding
resulting
in
damage
to
the
orchards
and
increased
operating
costs
for
petitioner.
the
complaint
sought
damages
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
other
relief.
relying
on
the
immunity
granted
by
the
flood
control
act
of
1928
which
states
that
"no
liability
of
any
kind
shall
attach
to
or
rest
upon
the
united
states
for
any
damage
from
or
by
floods
or
flood
waters
at
any
place".
the
united
states
moved
for
judgment
on
the
pleadings.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
because
the
parties
agreed
that
the
canal
was
a
part
of
the
friant
division
of
the
central
valley
project,
and
that
flood
control
was
one
of
that
project's
purposes.
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed,
holding
that
although
the
canal
serves
no
flood
control
purpose
itself,
immunity
attached
solely
because
the
canal
was
part
of
the
larger
project.
a
passage
from
this
court’s
decision
in
united
states
against
james,
a
case
decided
15
years
ago,
which
states
that
it
is
"clear
from
702c's
plain
language
that
the
terms
'flood'
and
'flood
waters'
apply
to
all
waters
contained
in
or
carried
through
a
federal
flood
control
project
for
purposes
of
or
related
to
flood
control"
provided
the
basis
for
the
ninth
circuit's
holding.
that
passage
however
was
unquestionably
dictum.
accordingly,
we
resort
to
the
statute's
text,
as
illuminated
by
the
holding
in
james,
rather
than
to
that
isolated
comment,
to
determine
whether
seciton
702c
immunity
attaches.
that
holding
namely
that
the
phrase
"flood
or
flood
waters"
encompasses
waters
that
are
released
for
flood
control
purposes
when
reservoired
waters
are
at
flood
stage
is
very
different
from
the
ninth
circuit's
reading
of
section
702c,
under
which
immunity
attaches
simply
because
the
madera
canal
is
part
of
the
central
valley
project,
and
flood
control
is
one
of
the
project's
purposes.
to
characterize
every
drop
of
water
that
flows
through
the
immense
central
valley
project
as
"flood
water"
simply
because
flood
control
is
among
its
many
purposes
unnecessarily
dilutes
the
statute's
language.
the
statute's
text
does
not
include
the
words
"flood
control
project,"
but,
rather,
states
that
immunity
attaches
to
"any
damage
from
or
by
floods
or
flood
waters”.
because
neither
the
statute's
language
nor
this
court’s
holding
in
james
supports
the
government's
submission
that
702c
immunity
must
attach
to
all
the
water
flowing
through
the
canal
we
disavow
the
dicta
from
our
decision
in
united
states
against
james.
in
determining
whether
702c
immunity
attaches,
courts
should
consider
the
character
of
the
waters
that
cause
the
relevant
damage
and
the
purposes
behind
their
release,
rather
than
merely
the
relation
between
that
damage
and
a
flood
control
project.
because
the
question
of
immunity
was
decided
on
the
pleadings,
using
an
incorrect
test
and
without
benefit
of
an
evidentiary
hearing
or
further
factual
development,
the
case
is
reversed
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
