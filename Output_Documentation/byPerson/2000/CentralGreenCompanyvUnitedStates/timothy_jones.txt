mr.
timothy
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner's
property
is
being
damaged
by
water
leaking
from
the
madera
canal.
the
canal
is
an
irrigation
facility
and
it
passes
irrigation
water
to
the
farmers
of
madera
county.
we
were
told
by
the
ninth
circuit
panel
below
that
all
of
the
water
in
this
canal
constitutes
flood
water
under
the
immunity
provisions
of
the
flood
control
act
of
1928
solely
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
this
canal
is
part
of
the
central
valley
project,
a
large
federal
water
project
covering
one-third
of
the
state
of
california,
with
multiple
component
parts
and
with
multiple
originating
purposes,
only
one
of
which
was
flood
control.
the
ninth
circuit
made
this
ruling
noting
that
this
canal
was
not
a
flood
control
project
by
itself,
and
served
no
flood
control
purpose.
the
ninth
circuit
further
indicated--
mr.
timothy
jones
--they
being
the
united
states,
your
honor?
mr.
timothy
jones
no.
they
did
not
concede
that
it
served
no
flood
control
purpose.
mr.
timothy
jones
yes,
it
did,
as
part
of
its
decision.
mr.
timothy
jones
yes.
it
would
be
under
a
relatively
limited
circumstances
and
the
problem
there
is,
this
water
is
liquid
gold.
they
marshall
it,
they
organize
it,
and
they
know
where
it
goes
and
why,
and
if
they're
going
to
spill
it
into
that
ground--
mr.
timothy
jones
--actually,
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
because
for
most
of
the
years
in
question
they
don't
put
water
into
that
canal
even
in
december.
the
amount
of
flood
space
that
they
reserve
in
this
canal
is
only
30
percent
of
the
entire...
in
the
lake
is
only
30
percent
of
the
entire
facility.
mr.
timothy
jones
correct.
mr.
timothy
jones
that
issue
was
not
briefed
at
the
ninth
circuit
level,
your
honor,
but
the
canal
itself
was
authorized
under
the
reclamation
laws
and
100
percent
of
its
costs
were
reimbursed
to
the
united
states
under
those
rules.
the
canal
itself
is
not
part
of
the
flood
routing
system
of
millerton
lake.
mr.
timothy
jones
i
do.
mr.
timothy
jones
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
facility
itself
is
operated...
if
that
ever
occurred,
still
it
would
be
a
question
of
fact
we'd
have
to
address
below,
but--
mr.
timothy
jones
--that
is
exactly
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
jones
flood
waters
consist
of,
and
i
think
this
court's
statement
in
united
states
v.
james
at
page
605
is
relatively
clear.
it
requires
a
federal
flood
control
project,
and
the
flood
waters
must
be
waters
that
are
contained
in
or
passing
through
that
project
for
purposes
of
or
related
to
flood
control.
mr.
timothy
jones
i
would
challenge
that
a
little
bit,
your
honor,
respectfully.
i
think--
mr.
timothy
jones
--that
might
make
the
canal
remotely
related
to
flood
control,
but
it
doesn't
make
the
waters
that
are
passing
through
the
canal...
under
circumstances
in
the
middle
of
summer,
it's
100
degrees
out,
the
river
is
dry
down
below
the
dam
20
miles,
and
they're
diverting
the
water
into
the
canal
under
contractual
obligations,
where
it's
bought
and
paid
for.
under
those
circumstances,
i
think
the
water,
which
is
what
the
statute
speaks
to,
is
not
flood
water.
mr.
timothy
jones
assuming
it's
a
federal
flood
control
project,
friant
dam
is,
it's
leaking
water
into
the
river
channel.
that
is
part
of
the
floodway.
what
you're
looking
at
is
the
natural
flow
of
this
river
and
they
put
a
dam
in
it,
and
if
it
leaks
into
the
river--
mr.
timothy
jones
--it's
leaking
into
the
floodway
of
the
river
itself.
it's
leaking
into
the
channel,
which
is
the
very
river
course.
mr.
timothy
jones
it
might
if
that's
part
of
the
facility.
i
mean...
what
you're
looking
at
is,
is
the
river
channel
runs...
this
facility,
if
it
were
operated
as
a
flood
control
facility,
would
impound
water
at
most
once
every
4
years.
mr.
timothy
jones
well,
your
honor,
i
think
two
things.
mr.
timothy
jones
yes,
we
want
the
opportunity
to
go
back,
and
i
think
that
we
want
to
be
able
to
establish
that
the
water
has
never
been...
or
at
least
at
times
has
been
released
for
purposes
other
than
flood
control.
mr.
timothy
jones
that's
correct.
the
canal
is...
the
lining
of
the
canal
is
cracking,
and
it's
leaking
water,
it's
raising
the
water
table
and
it's--
mr.
timothy
jones
--that's
right.
mr.
timothy
jones
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
part
about
the
way
the
facility
was
constructed.
are
you
talking
about
the
canal
or
the
dam?
mr.
timothy
jones
i
don't
think
that
that's
what
we're
saying.
what
we're
saying
is,
is
that
the
facility...
one
of
our
claims
is
that
they're
just
not
maintaining
it.
the
concrete
cracks,
they
patch
some
of
it,
they
don't
patch
the
others,
and
some
of
it
is
deteriorating,
and
it
needs
to
be
repaired.
mr.
timothy
jones
we
could,
except
the
dam
would
be
passing
water
right
into
the
floodway
itself.
this,
it
passes
on
to
other
people's
property.
the
dam
got
flowage
rights.
when
friant
was
built
they
obtained
flowage
rights
to
pass
water
in
certain
ways
and
the
fact
that
the
dam
is
either
leaking
or
has
its
gates
open
isn't
going
to
give
rise
to
a
claim.
mr.
timothy
jones
i
understand,
your
honor,
and
that's
very
true.
this...
the
clear
context,
and
i
think
this
court
in
james
said
that,
that
the
context
was
a
floodworks
project
like
the
mississippi
river,
and
we're
not
dealing
with
a
floodworks
project
like
the
mississippi
river.
we're
dealing--
mr.
timothy
jones
--i
think
that's
absolutely
true,
because
if
this
was...
if
this
canal
was
going
to
be
constructed
for
flood
control
they
would
have
never
built
it.
they'd
have
never
built
that
dam.
they'd
have
built
it
much
lower...
there's
only
a
fraction
of
the
space
of
this
whole
facility
that
serves
any
flood
purposes.
mr.
timothy
jones
it
definitely
provides
some
flood
relief.
i
don't
know
that
i
would
say
it
provides
a
substantial
flood
purpose,
because
if
they
open
the
gates
to
channel
capacity
it
would
not
impound
a
drop
of
water
for
3
years
at
a
time,
maybe
1
year
it
would
impound
water
for
a
limited
period
of
time
and
they'd
never
reach
25
percent
or
20
percent
of
this
capacity--
mr.
timothy
jones
--yes
they
do
route
the
sacramento
river
water
down
into
the
san
joaquin
valley
and
they
do
route
the
water
of
the
river--
mr.
timothy
jones
--but
you
don't
impound
water
like
this
for
flood
control.
if
you're
going
to
impound
water
in
the
way
they
impound
it...
i
mean,
the
united
states
said
in
their
brief
at
page
3,
you
impound
water
as
soon
as
possible
for
irrigation,
and
you
hold
it
as
long
as
you
can
until
you
need
it,
and
that's
what
they
do
with
this
facility,
and
they
said
you
impound
water
only
at
the
last
moment
for
flood
control
when
you
have
to
and
you
evacuate
it
as
quickly
as
possible.
this
facility
just
isn't
operated
that
way.
mr.
timothy
jones
the
first
presumption...
the
reason
the
dam
is
full
is
because
of
the
irrigation
retention,
but
assuming
i
understand
the
hypothetical,
and
i
think
i
do,
the
water
that
would
go
into
the
canal
under
those
circumstances
may
very
well
be
flood
water,
and
it
may
very
well
carry
the
immunity,
but
it
would
be
in
a
very
limited
circumstance.
mr.
timothy
jones
is
that...
i
mean,
it
sounds
like
that's
a
causal--
mr.
timothy
jones
--i
think
our
position--
mr.
timothy
jones
--well,
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
couple
of
different
issues,
and
if
i
understood
the
question
properly
you're
saying
if
you
have
a
certain
percentage
of
the
water
going
down
the
canal
is
flood
water,
and
a
certain
percentage
of
the
water
going
down
the
canal,
a
larger
percentage,
is
irrigation
water,
is
not
immune,
then
wouldn't
you
simply
look
at
the
damages
and
deal
with
that
as
a
matter
of
causation,
because
some
of
that
water
was
not
subject
to
the
immunity.
it
clearly
wasn't,
and
if
that
wasn't
enough
to
damage
the
trees,
if
the
amount
of
water
that
went
in
the
canal
was
not
enough
to
damage
the
trees,
that
was
not
immune.
mr.
timothy
jones
then
that's
what
we
think
happened
here.
mr.
timothy
jones
well,
yeah.
what
the
ninth
circuit
said
is
that
this
immunity,
the
way
they're
construing
it
is
so
broad
that
they
could
not
think
of
a
single
instance
where
the
immunity
did
not
apply
in
the
central
valley--
mr.
timothy
jones
--i
was
there
at
the
argument,
and
i
think
the
court
was
very
troubled
by
what
they
were
having
to
do.
mr.
timothy
jones
right.
mr.
timothy
jones
yes.
i
think
that
their
test
is
not-wholly-unrelated
to
the
project,
which
i
think
is
also
compounding
the
problem.
mr.
timothy
jones
and
so
we
think
the
not-wholly-unrelated
test
is
the
wrong
test
applied
to
the
wrong--
mr.
timothy
jones
--right.
mr.
timothy
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
jones
what
happened
is,
we
don't
believe
we
need
to
go
much
beyond
the
language
of
james
as
long
as
not-wholly-unrelated
means
something
more
than
remotely
incidental,
but
we
offered...
in
the
case
the
court
decided
to
try
to
use
this
case
as
a
test,
we
offered
a
test.
we
put
together
what
we
thought
made
sense
in
light
of
the
flood
control
act
and
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
tried
to
determine
how
it
would
be
applied
in
a
multipurpose
facility.
mr.
timothy
jones
yes,
it--
mr.
timothy
jones
--it
would
if
you
didn't
take
substantial-to-the-injury
and
say,
if
flood
water
was
a
substantial
contributing
cause
to
the
injury
you
have
no
claim
at
all,
as
opposed
to
saying,
if
it's
a
substantial
part
of
the
facility,
flood
control
is
a
substantial
part
of
the
facility
and,
in
order
for
the
flood
water
to
be
flood
water,
it
has
to
have
a
substantial
relationship
to
flood
control,
then
that's
fine.
but
if
you
take
it
to
the
next
step
of
the
injury
as
a
cause,
then
you
could
wipe
out
our
injury
completely,
even
though
three-quarters
of
it
was
caused
by
the
united
states--
mr.
timothy
jones
--yes.
mr.
timothy
jones
i
think
that
there
is
no
substantial
use
of
that
canal
for
flood
control
based
on
anything
i've
seen.
mr.
timothy
jones
i
think
we'd
have
to.
mr.
timothy
jones
yes.
mr.
timothy
jones
it's
raised
as
a
matter
of
jurisdiction,
and
so
i
think
it's
our
burden--
mr.
timothy
jones
--yeah,
we
read
that
language
to
say,
first
of
all,
the
reference
to
waters
is
flood
waters,
not
any
water,
and
we
read
it
to
say
that
in
the
normal
operations
of
the
facility,
if
the
water
overrides
the
banks,
or
overrides
whatever
control
facilities
are
constructed,
the
united
states
would
not
be
liable
for
injuries
caused
by
that
overriding.
we
think
that's
wholly
different
than
what
we're
dealing
with
here,
where
it's
just
a
continuous
leak
out
of
a
nonmaintained
facility,
and
if
the
water
was
not
flood
water
going
into
the
canal,
it
can't
be
flood
water
leaking
out.
mr.
timothy
jones
i
think
the
central
valley
project
can
be
identified
by
segments
of
the
project.
i
wouldn't...
i
can't
speak
to
all
of
it,
but
i
can
speak
to
the
madera
canal.
the
madera
canal
itself
was
funded
as
an
irrigation
project.
it
can
relieve
the
lake
of
pressure,
so
to
speak,
into
another
natural
waterway
that
itself
is
out
of
the
same
watershed,
so
when
you
look
at
the
totality
of
it,
it
doesn't
make
sense
for
them
to
operate
this
for
a
flood
facility.
they
wouldn't
put
water
into
the
madera
canal
necessarily
just
to
run
it
to
another
river
that
itself
would
be
flooding.
mr.
timothy
jones
that's
true.
this
court
did--
mr.
timothy
jones
--i
think
that
that's
a
fair
statement.
mr.
timothy
jones
i
believe
that
that's
correct,
and
i
think
they
have
conceded
that.
interestingly
enough,
in
their
contract
with
the
madera
irrigation
district
they
define
irrigation
water
as
water
used
primarily
in
the
production
of
agricultural
crops
or
livestock,
including
domestic
use
incidental
thereto
and
watering
of
livestock.
that's
at
page
8
of
their
supplemental
lodging.
mr.
timothy
jones
i'm
not
aware
of
any
consent
being
required.
i
think
they
have
the
power
to
do
that
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
timothy
jones
well,
i
apologize,
but
that
obviously
is
in
the
contract.
mr.
timothy
jones
i
believe
those
records
most
definitely
exist.
they
calibrate--
mr.
timothy
jones
--we--
mr.
timothy
jones
--we
know
that
the
gauging
of
the
water
coming
into
the
lake,
we
know
how
much
is
impounded,
we
know
what
the
storage
is,
we
know
what's
diverted
and
when
it's
diverted
and
why
it's
diverted
and
who's
paying
for
it
and
why
they're
paying
for
it
and
whether
it's
class
i,
class
ii,
or
class
ii
obligation.
i
think
that
because
this
is
operated
for
the
economic
use
of
the
facility,
all
of
that
information
is
very--
mr.
timothy
jones
--i
think
that
that's
true.
unless
there's
any
questions
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
timothy
jones
thank
you,
your
honor.
if
i
could
take
you
to
our
reply
brief,
because
we
did
address,
although
we
objected
to
the
judicial
notice
of
all
the
facts
we
did
address
them
there,
and
we
noted
that
in
a
majority
of
the
years
in
the
1979
to
1999
period
selected
by
respondent,
flows
from
the
dam
into
the
river
bed
never
approached
8,000
cubic
feet
per
second,
which
petitioner
gauged
by
setting
thresholds
of
7600
cubic
feet
per
second
on
a
single
day
of
the
entire
year
and
so,
as
far
as
petitioner
could
determine
on
those
days
that
flows
into
the
river
bed
did
approach
8,000
cubic
feet
per
second
they
showed
no
correlation
with
the
higher
flows
in
the
madera
canal.
point
2.
this
project
was
funded
as
a
reclamation
project.
the
canal
was
identified
as
an
irrigation
canal.
this
is
not
a
project
where
congress
put
money
out
and
exposed
its
treasury
to
something
it
wasn't
going
to
be
reimbursed
for.
this
is
not
the
context
of
the
mississippi
river
flood
project.
and
i
would
like
to
answer
any
questions,
if
there
are
any
others.
mr.
timothy
jones
the
shasta
dam,
as
i
understand
it,
was,
and
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
should
know,
but
i
don't.
it
probably
was.
