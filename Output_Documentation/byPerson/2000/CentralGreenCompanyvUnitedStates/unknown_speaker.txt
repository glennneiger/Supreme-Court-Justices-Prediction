unknown
speaker
did
they
concede
that
it
served
no
flood
control
purpose?
i
wasn't
aware
of
that.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
did
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
it
served
no
flood
control
purpose?
unknown
speaker
now,
do
you
concede
that
water
could
be
released
into
the
madera
canal
for
flood
control
purposes,
for
example
to
make
more
room
in
the
reservoir
for
flood
waters
that
are
anticipated?
could
that
happen?
unknown
speaker
it's
liquid
gold
until
december.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
have
to
say...
i
recognize
the
case
is
here
on
dismissal
of
the
pleadings.
unknown
speaker
and
that
you
have
indicated
in
your
brief
that
in
some
events
maybe
the
case
should
go
back,
that
we
shouldn't
just
rule
for
the
government.
i
am
troubled
by
the
assumption
of
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
canal
is
not
related
to
flood
control
in
any
respect.
that's
the
inference
i
get
from
its
statement,
and
i
find
that
somewhat
troubling.
unknown
speaker
well,
can't
it
be,
though...
i
mean,
the
government
points
out
in
the
brief
that
there
are
limitations
in
a
flood
situation
on
the
amount
of
water
that
can
be
discharged
downstream,
and
in
order
to
comply
with
those
limitations
they
might
have
to
use
this
canal
to
run
off
surplus
water,
so
the
united
states
is
saying
that
there
certainly
are
situations
in
which
this
canal
would
have
a
flood
control
use.
do
you
concede
that
that's
at
least
possible?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
say
that
if
the
escaping
water
resulted
from
that
particular
kind
of
flood
control
use
there
would
be
immunity.
if
the
escaping
water
was
not
so
related
there
would
be
no
immunity,
and
you'd
in
effect
have
to
apportion
the
damage...
well,
not
apportion
the
damages.
you'd
have
to
do
a
causation
analysis.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
so
you
say
flood
waters
would
include
two
things,
waters
going
through
a
facility
that
was
primarily
built
for
flood
control
purposes,
no?
what
are
your
categories?
what
does
flood
waters
consist
of?
unknown
speaker
well,
related...
related
to...
i
mean,
that's
pretty
wide.
if
we'd
apply
that,
i
think
you
lose
here.
unknown
speaker
you
acknowledge
it's
remotely
enough...
it's
remotely
related
to
flood
control
in
that
should
there
be
a
flood
they
can
release
some
of
the
excess
flood
waters
through
this
canal.
unknown
speaker
suppose
at
that
point
the
dam
itself
started
to
leak
and
caused
damage.
would
the
government
be
immune
in
that
instance?
unknown
speaker
and
you're
saying
the
government
then
would
be
immune
because
it's
in
the
river
bed?
unknown
speaker
so
whether
or
not
it's
flood
water
depends
on
where
it
ultimately
comes
out?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
effect
you
want
the
opportunity
to
go
back
and
establish
that
the
water
in
the
madera
canal
has
never
been
released
in
connection
with
flood
control
purposes.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
may
it
not
depend
on
the
kind
of
claim
you're
making
against
the
government?
i
mean,
if
water
is...
someone
is
drowned
in
a
boat
accident
as
a
result
of
flood
waters
being
released
out
of
a
dam,
you
have
a
single
incident
that
occurs
right
then.
i
take
it
your
claim
is
based
on
leaching
out,
or
some
sort
of
damage
to
the
soil
over
a
period
of
years.
unknown
speaker
so
it
didn't
happen
on
any
one
day.
it
happened--
unknown
speaker
--it
seems
to
me
that
makes
your
case
a
little
harder,
because
it's
project-related.
this
is
not
like
the
case
where
the
corps
of
engineers
boat
was
being
driven
by
a
drunk
driver,
which
doesn't
seem
to
have
much
to
do
with
floods
at
all.
but
here,
it
has
to
do
with
the
way
the
whole
facility
was
constructed,
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
harder
case
for
you.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
long-term
damage.
the
damage
occurs
over
a
period
of
time
because
of
the
way
that
the
canal
was
constructed,
or
misconstructed,
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
more
closely
related
to
the
purpose
of
immunity,
which
is
to
protect
the
government
when
it
erects
this
facility,
than
in
some
of
these
cases
where
you
have...
where
people
are
sucked
down
into
tunnels
and
so
forth
during
irrigation
season.
unknown
speaker
but
you
could
say
the
same
thing
if
it
were
the
dam.
unknown
speaker
this
whole
scenario,
in
effect,
was
quite
beyond
the
contemplation
of
congress
in
1928.
when
it's
talking
about
flooding
on
the
mississippi.
there
are
no
dams
on
the
mississippi
river,
needless
to
say.
unknown
speaker
you
say,
if
i
understand
your
case,
you
wouldn't
take
a
position
that
flood
waters
are
never...
you're
not
going
to
try
to
prove
that
flood
waters
were
never
released
through
this
canal,
but
you
would
say
categorically
that
the
canal
itself,
when
constructed,
had
no
flood
control
purpose.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
concede
that
the
friant
dam
has
a
substantial
flood
control
purpose?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
part
of
an
entire
project.
the
sacramento
river
waters
couldn't
go
to
the
san
joaquin
if
the
friant
didn't
back...
didn't
stop
the
natural
tributary.
unknown
speaker
and
they
can
only
do
that
because
of
the
friant
dam.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
it
is,
in
the
sense
that
when
the
people
were
thinking
of
building
this,
they
thought,
we'll
use
it
mostly
for
irrigation,
but
you
know
the
san
joaquin
floods
sometimes
too
and
then
what
we'll
do
is
we'll
have
the
water
held
behind
the
dam.
it
normally
will
go
into
the
san
joaquin
river,
sometimes
there's
too
much
of
it,
sometimes
we'll
divert
it
up
through
the
canal,
it'll
run
into
the
chowchilla
river
or
the
fresno
river.
so
they're
thinking
both.
they
agree
most
of
the
time,
irrigation,
some
of
the
time,
for
just
overflow
of
flood
water.
and
who
wins?
and
moreover,
there's
a
crack
in
the
canal,
so
that
means
most
of
the
time
the
water
that's
running
out
is
water
that
would
be
there
for
irrigation,
and
some
of
the
time
the
water
that
runs
out
through
the
crack
is
water
that
would
be...
would
have
been
released
because
there
was
too
much
water
behind
the
dam
and
the
san
joaquin
river
was
filled
up.
right,
now,
who
wins
under
those
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
so
you
want
to
divide
it
say
proportionate
90-10.
but
another
to
do
it
is
to
say
that
so
long
as
the
water
that's
sometimes
in
that
canal
and
running
out
through
the
crack
that
was
too
big
is
flood
water,
so
long
as
that's
so,
as
long
as
that's
a
substantial
amount
of
the
water
that's
causing
the
damage,
i.e.
as
long
as
a
substantial
amount
is
water
that
would
have
otherwise
gone
into
the
san
joaquin
river
but
did
not
because
there
is
too
much
water
behind
the
dam
and
the
river
was
filled
up,
as
long
as
that's
substantial,
the
government's
entirely
immune.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
opposite
theory
one
way,
it's
very
simple
case
that
way.
you
know,
there's
no
doubt
that
there's
substantial...
that
this
is,
i'd
say,
substantially
related
to
flood
control,
though
mostly
related
to
irrigation,
the
canal,
then
there's
no
doubt
that
some
of
the
time
the
river,
the
water
that
goes
through
that
canal
is
water
that
would
otherwise
be
dumped
into
the
san
joaquin,
that
it
was
all
filled
up,
but
that's
a
fairly
small
but
still
substantial
amount
of
time.
and
there's
no
doubt
that
that
water
causes
some
of
the
damage,
but
surely
not
even
half.
all
right.
so
then
i
think
it
comes
down
to,
do
we
do
it
on
a
proportional
basis,
or
do
you
do
it
on
a,
well,
if
it's
substantially
mixed
in,
you
lose?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
analyze
it,
really?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gather
it's
already
a
stretch
to
say,
as
james
said,
that
water
which
is
held
behind
a
dam
that
is
not
really
flood
water,
it's
water
that's
been
accumulating
over
the
summer,
but
if
the
dam
is
for
flood-control
purposes
we're
going
to
consider
all
that
water
flood
water.
that's
a
very
unusual
use
of
the
term,
flood
waters.
i
mean,
you
think
about
the
raging
mississippi.
those
are
flood
waters.
then
what
the
government
wants
is
yet
another
extension,
and
what
justice
breyer
was
proposing,
and
that
is
that
any
facility
that
is
even
used
in
part
for
flood
control
purposes,
all
the
water
passing
through
that
facility,
including
the
nonflood
water
part,
becomes
flood
waters.
that
stretches
it
pretty
thin,
pretty
thin.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
the
ninth
circuit
test,
in
effect.
unknown
speaker
it
almost
reads
as
though
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
but
didn't
want
to
say
it,
that
it
was
very
troubled
by
it's
own
holding.
unknown
speaker
i
think
what
justice
breyer's
question
suggests
is
that
if
we
were
trying
to
determine
causation
in
order
to
impose
liability,
to
impose
liability,
if
there
are
multiple
causes,
multiple
actors,
if
there's
a
substantial
cause
then
the
actor
is
joint
and
severally
liable
for
100
percent
of
the
damage.
the
mirror
image
of
that
might
be
that
you
have
100
percent
immunity
if
a
substantial
purpose
of
the
facility
is
irrigation,
and
i
guess
the
problem
with
that
from
your
standpoint
is
that
we're
just
stacking
the
deck.
unknown
speaker
we're
saying,
well,
you
also
have
a
substantial
cause,
which
is
irrigation,
and
you're
not
immune
for
that,
which
leaves
us,
i
guess,
right
back
where
we
started.
i
guess
standard
tort
principles
don't
seem
to
help
us
much.
well,
are
you...
i
take
it
that
all
you
really
want
us
to
do
here
is
to
say
that
the
ninth
circuit
test,
not-wholly-unrelated
test,
either
is
a
matter
of
substance
or
is
a
matter
of
creating
a
presumption
in
applying
the
james
test,
went
beyond
james,
and
that
we
ought
to
reverse
or
vacate
because
that
erroneous
standard
was
applied,
and
i
take
it
that
you
don't
really
need
to
have
us
or
want
us
necessarily
to
do
anything
more
at
this
stage
except
send
it
back
and
say,
apply
james
the
way
we
wrote
james,
and
then
if
you
don't
like
it
later,
maybe
there'll
be
another
appeal,
but
am
i
right
that
that's
all
you
really
want
us
to
do,
is
to
say
that
not-wholly-unrelated
goes
beyond
james?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying
they're
using
the
wrong
category:
project.
unknown
speaker
and
they're
using
in
effect
a...
they're
creating
a
kind
of
presumption
in
applying
that
category
and
that
presumption
is
also
inconsistent
with
the
way
we
wrote
james,
even
if
they
got
the
category
right,
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--do
i
understand
you?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
were
asking
to
do
more,
not
to
leave...
to
say
the
ninth
circuit
test
is
no
good,
because
it's
wholly-related...
not-unrelated
won't
do.
i
thought
you
were
asking
us
to
substitute
another
test
which
you
had
identified
as
a
primary
purpose
test.
justice
breyer
introduced
yet
another
test,
which
sounded
to
me
like
you
figured
out
how
much
of
the
flow
was
for
irrigation,
how
much
for
flood
control,
and
then
you
do
kind
of
an
apportionment
that
wouldn't
be
an
all-or-nothing
immunity.
i
thought
that's
what
he
was
saying.
but
you're
saying,
if
the
primary
purpose
is
irrigation,
then
there's
no
immunity,
even
if
a
substantial
purpose
would
be
flood
control.
unknown
speaker
well,
james,
as
the
chief
justice
indicated,
didn't
apply
to
a
system
where
we
had
irrigation
facilities.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the...
that
your
primary
purpose
does
not
give
the
government
quite
enough
protection,
because
a
major
purpose,
part
of
the
major
design
of
this
entire
system
is
for
flood
control
purposes.
on
the
other
hand,
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
to
answer
your
argument
that
that
protects
the
government
in
every
single
instance.
is
a
substantial...
if
we
said
the...
if
flood
control
is
a
substantial
reason
for
the
facility
and
for
the
operation
that
caused
the
damage,
could
you
go
back
for
trial
on
that?
unknown
speaker
and
would
it
give
the
district
court
enough
guidance?
unknown
speaker
well,
can
you
sustain
a
proposition
that
the
facility
that
should
be
examined
is
the
madera
canal
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
because
it
seems
to
me
if
the
only
facility
we
examine
is
the
madera
canal,
and
what
it
may
get...
you
certainly
do
not
give
anything
close
to
a
substantial
use
for
flood
control.
unknown
speaker
do
i
understand
correctly,
mr.
jones,
that
you're
willing
to
acknowledge
that
the
damages
your
client
received
should
be
reduced
by
the
proportion
of
the
total
water
going
through
the
canal
that
is
really
flood
water
under
your
interpretation
of
flood
water?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
a
question
which
i
should
know
the
answer
to,
but
i
don't,
and
i
want
help.
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
immunity
here?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
your
burden.
it's
a
jurisdictional
issue
and
it's
your
burden.
with
respect
to
the
james
test,
mr.
jones,
there's
a
phrase
in
it
that
i
don't
understand,
and
could
you
tell
me
how
you
read
the
phrase
that
says
that
immunity
extends
to
waters
flood
control
projects
cannot
control?
unknown
speaker
i
have
some
difficulty
in
adopting
a
test
that
this
is
an
irrigation
facility.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
whole
design
of
the
central
valley
project
is
that
it's
an
integrated
whole,
and
i
don't
know
how
we
could
take
different
pieces,
the
madera
canal,
the
friant
current
canal,
which
i
take
it
takes
a
much
larger
volume
of
water,
and
even
the
friant
dam
itself
and
say,
well,
this
is
primarily
irrigation.
i
just
don't
think
you
can
do
that
with
the
central
valley
project.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
have
trouble
with
that
in
times
of
high
water.
i
just
don't
think
that's
right,
but
that's
for
the
trier
of
fact
to
figure
out.
i'm
just
not
sure
what
test
we'd
use
in
order
to
separate
out
discrete
parts
of
the
central
valley
project
and
say
some
are
irrigation,
some
are
not.
much
of
the
time,
all
the
project
is
used
for
irrigation.
there's
no
flood
danger.
unknown
speaker
there's
latent
flood
danger,
and
the
entire
project
is
designed
to
accommodate
that.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
this...
isn't
it
true
that
the
government
itself
classified...
has
class
i
water
and
class
ii
water
that
goes
through
this
project,
and
that
class
i
water
would
never
be
flood
water?
unknown
speaker
does
the
agreement
require
some
kind
of
consent
by
the
parties
to
release
any
flood
water
in
the
madera
canal?
unknown
speaker
unilaterally?
i
thought
there
was
something
in
the
agreement.
i
think
justice
o'connor
is
right.
in
a
document
i
have
called
the
post
flood
assessment
it
says
that
flood
releases
may
also
be
made
of
the
friant
current
canal
and
madera
canal
if
all
parties
agree,
and
that's
rather
baffling
to
me--
unknown
speaker
--i
thought
it
was.
you
mentioned,
or
justice
kennedy
earlier
mentioned
some
problems
that
the
trier
of
fact
would
have.
one
of
those
problems
might
be
the
existence
of
records
for
the
purpose
to
apply
this
apportionment
rule.
do
you...
can
you
represent
that
in
fact
they
do
keep
sufficiently
detailed
records
to
know
when
they're
using
the
canal
for
flood
control
run-off
and
when
they're
using
it
for
normal
irrigation
purposes?
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
they're
not...
i
mean,
this
is
a
preliminary
pleading
issue,
so
they're
not
in
the
record
of
this
case,
and
we'd
better...
i
suppose
we
had
better
be
sure
of
that
before
we
come
up
with
a
rule
that
requires
apportionment.
unknown
speaker
or
at
least
we
ought
to
be
sure
that
they
can
keep
these
records
in
a
practical
way,
and
we
don't
know
that,
do
we?
well,
don't
we
know
that
they
charge
a
different
rate
for
class
i
water
than
they
do
for
class
ii
water,
so
they
have
to
have
some
way
of
apportioning
it.
unknown
speaker
they
must
have
it.
there's
some
loss
from
evaporation.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
you
can
take
figures
in
the
lake
and
just
assume
that
all
of
that
water
ends
up
in
the
ditch.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
jones.
mr.
frederick,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
ninth
circuit
did
say
that
the
madera
canal
is
not
a
flood
control
project
and
serves
no
flood
control
purpose.
now,
if
your
focus
is
on
the
friant
dam
and
you
look
at
the
overall
project
in
a
third
of
the
state
of
california,
you
can
say
it's
related
to
flood
control,
but
if
you
focus
instead
in
the
madera
canal,
the
ninth
circuit
said
it
just
wasn't...
it
serves
no
flood
control
purpose.
unknown
speaker
so
where
do
we
focus?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
reality
is
the
madera
canal
serves
irrigation
purposes,
that's
the
reality.
unknown
speaker
but
presumably
it
can't,
under
that
agreement,
release
more
than
the
farmers
can
use
for
flood
control
purposes
without
the
agreement
of
the
parties.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
it
say
that?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
plaintiffs
below
show
that
never
in
the
history
of
the
madera
canal
has
that
happened?
unknown
speaker
never.
unknown
speaker
justice
o'connor
asked
you
a
question,
mr.
frederick.
i
hope
you'll
get
to
the
answer
quite
soon.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
this
was
dismissed
on
the
pleadings...
they
said
they
were
prepared
to
show
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
frederick,
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
you,
but
i
hope
you'll
tell
us
some
time
in
the
argument
what
you
don't
tell
us
in
your
brief,
whether
you
defend
the
ninth
circuit's
test.
unknown
speaker
if
you
do,
you
don't
need
all
these
facts.
unknown
speaker
all
you
need
is
some
flood
control
purpose
in
the
project
and
that's
enough,
and
you
win.
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
then
we
don't
need
these
facts.
do
you
also
accept
the
ninth
circuit's
statement
that
the
madera
canal
is
for
irrigation
purposes
only?
unknown
speaker
you
disagree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
justice
o'connor
asked
the
question,
suppose
the
trier
of
fact
found
100
percent
of
the
water,
or
let's
say,
98
percent
of
the
water
over
the
last
10
years
in
madera
canal
has
been
for
irrigation
purposes
only,
any
difference
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
the
language
congress
used
is,
floods
or
flood
waters.
i
don't
know
that
that
affords
any
basis
for
going
down...
back
to
the
design
of
an
entire
project,
instead
of
looking
as
to
whether
the
particular
waters
here
were
in
fact
flood
waters.
unknown
speaker
but
then
98
percent
of
the
water
in
this
canal
isn't.
unknown
speaker
98
percent?
you
can
show
that
the--
unknown
speaker
--what
percent
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
i
used
to
live
in
california.
i
mean,
it's
dry
most
of
the
time,
so
it
would
be
amazing
to
me
if
like
there's
going
to
be
a
flood
in
summer
there.
i--
unknown
speaker
--no,
but
we're
talking
about
flood
water,
and
the
flood
water
the
chief
justice
just
pointed
out,
he
gave
that
definition,
and
i
was
saying
it
seemed
to
me
that
98
percent...
i'll
give
you
at
the
moment
that
the
canal
is
part
of
a
flood
control
project.
we
could
define
that
as
a
project
that's
substantially,
but
not
entirely,
used
for
flood
control.
okay,
i'll
give
you
that
for
the
sake
of
argument.
but
what
about
the
water?
the
water,
you've
got
the
definition
he
just
said.
adopting
that
definition,
i
don't
see
how
more
than
about
1
percent,
if
that,
could
be
flood
water,
water
that
would
have
overflowed
the
banks
of
the
san
joaquin
or
any
other
of
these
dry
places.
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--well,
why
do
we
look
at
that
when
we
have
a
congressional
definition
of
flood
waters?
unknown
speaker
but
surely
the
inquiry
is
a
factual
one,
not
some
directive
from
the
corps
of
engineers
that
says
what
may
occasionally
happen,
you
know,
what
has
in
fact
happened
with
respect
to
the
madera
canal
over
the
last
10
years.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
frederick,
that
just
isn't
the
immunity
statute.
that
is
what
we
look
at,
not
the
construction
of
the
central
california
project.
we
have
to
focus
on
the
immunity
statute
that
was
passed
in
the
wake
of
that
1927
massive
flood
of
the
mississippi
river.
congress
didn't
have,
in
this
immunity
section,
in
mind
the
kind
of
situation
we've
got
with
the
madera
canal,
where
it's
used
for
irrigation
purposes
and
it's
alleged
to
have
been
constructed
in
a
faulty
manner,
it's
cracked
and
the
water's
leaking
out.
apparently,
to
a
nonuser
of
the
canal,
but
flooding
the
property.
now,
they
didn't
have
that
in
mind.
unknown
speaker
she's
talking
about
the
1928
act--
--i'm
talking
about
the
immunity
language,
and
you
seem
to
conflate
the
purpose
of
the
construction
of
the
central
california
project,
and
i
just...
i
have
a...
i
have
trouble
converting--
unknown
speaker
--james
had
a
very
different
situation
in
mind.
it
did
have
genuine
flood,
water
escaping
through
the
system
and
somebody
drowning
as
a
result
when
it
flooded
over.
this
is
far
removed
from
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
blessedly
there
are
farmers
who
want
to
use
it,
so
of
course
it's
released.
it
could
be
used
five
times
over
if
there
were
enough
water.
the
farmers
are
there,
dying
for
water.
unknown
speaker
i
see
that,
but...
okay.
suppose...
i'm
now
giving
you
this.
a
flood
control
project
is
a
project
that
has
a
substantial
purpose
related
to
flood
control.
then
i
think
you
have
to
get
to
water,
and
the
water,
as
you
pointed
out,
is
it's
contained
or
carried
through
a
flood
control
project
for
purposes
of
or
related
to
flood
control.
all
right.
suppose
i
were
to
say,
what
that
means
is
that
the
water
is
where
it
is
for
a
purpose
substantially
related
to
flood
control.
now,
if
that's
so,
except
for
a
tiny
little
bit,
this
is
not
flood
control
water.
unknown
speaker
because?
unknown
speaker
ah,
but
i
said,
is
where
it
is,
and
it's
not
in
the
san
joaquin
bed,
which
is
where
it
would
be.
it's
diverted
over
because...
and
let's
take
it
in
august,
okay.
in
august,
that
water
would
normally
be
released
into
the
san
joaquin
bed,
and
now
it
isn't
released
to
the
san
joaquin
bed,
why,
for
irrigation
purposes,
100
percent.
that's
the
answer
to
that
question,
nothing
to
do
with
flood
control.
unknown
speaker
okay,
let's
accept
that.
that's
why
i
think
you
have
to
get
to
the
third
part
of
this,
which
is
the
causation
part,
if
we're
going
to
say
anything
useful,
and
on
that
i
thought
you'd
say,
look
across
the
year
about
98
percent
of
the
time
it
is
diverted
from
the
san
joaquin
bed
just
for
irrigation
purposes.
some
percent
of
the
time...
i'll
give
you
as
much
as
you
want,
but
it's
not
going
to
be
more
than
50...
it's
diverted
for,
let's
say,
flood
control
purposes,
and
now
we
have
to
say
that
the
causation
problem
is
solved
by
saying,
you
know,
one,
this
water
wouldn't
have
been
substituted
by
some
other
water,
and
the
second
thing
is,
you
have
to
apportion
the
damages,
i
think.
now,
i'm
putting
that
whole
thing
out
to
get
your
comment.
unknown
speaker
but
i
don't
see
how
else
to
make
it
work.
unknown
speaker
what
is--
--well--
--the
basis
for
your
statement
that
congress
assumed
that
immunity
would
apply
when
it
did
this
particular
project?
it
wasn't
until
james
that
we
held
that
immunity
applied
to
anything
except
property
damage.
unknown
speaker
i
know.
unknown
speaker
but
it
hadn't
been
addressed
until
then.
unknown
speaker
and
of
course,
which
except
for
property
damage
wasn't
even
necessary,
because
the
federal
tort
claims
act--
--there
was
no
federal
tort
claims
act.
--hadn't
even
been
passed.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
then
on
your
theory...
and
what
you've
just
said
raises
the
same
question
that
your
answer
to
justice
breyer
raised
with
me.
on
your
theory,
will
there
ever
be
a
situation
in
which
the
immunity
won't
apply?
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
the
discrete
situation?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
if
the
discrete
situation
applies
in
the
accident,
why
shouldn't
the
discrete
situation,
in
effect,
rule
apply
here
if
they
can
show
by
the
records
kept
by
the
dam
that
except
in,
let's
say,
five
instances
in
which
the
canal
was
used
for
overflow
for
flood
control
purposes,
all
the
other
water
that
was
diverted
into
that
canal
was
for
nonflood-control
purposes
and
therefore
you
would
get
your
immunity
on
some
apportionment
theory?
why
wouldn't
that
apply,
if
you
accept
the
discrete
release
exception--
unknown
speaker
--to
liability?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
be
an
unusual
way,
unless
we
are
going
to
allow
your
theory
of
immunity
to
become
a
plenary
theory
in
which
there
will
never
be
liability,
isn't
that
what
we're
going
to
have
to
do?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
isn't
that
what
we're
going
to
have
to
do?
unknown
speaker
yes
or
no.
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
but
it
didn't
want
there
to
be
complete
immunity,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
so
we're
going
to
have
to
have
some
kind
of
mechanism
to
apportion
causation
for
jurisdictional
purposes,
don't
we?
unknown
speaker
okay,
and
that
was
a...
that
really
stretched
the
statute,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
because
the
statute
didn't
have
a
related-to
condition.
unknown
speaker
now,
wait
a
minute,
you
think
congress
was
talking
about
damming
the
mississippi
river?
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
congress
really
thought
that
if
they
built
the
levee
on
the
mississippi,
and
the
if
the
levee
leaked
during
the
middle
of
the
summer,
when
there
were
no
flood
waters
in
sight,
that
the
immunity
would
attach?
unknown
speaker
then
i
still--
--it
isn't
clear
to
me.
i
think
it's
already
a
stretch
to
say
that
the
waters
held
behind
a
flood
control
project
even
during
a
period
when
there's
no
risk
of
flood
are
flood
waters.
that's
just
a
stretch
of
the
english
language,
and
to
carry
it
further,
as
you
now
want
us
to
do,
that
even
canals
leading
off
of
the
main
flood
control
project
which
are
sometimes
used
for
the
release
of
flood
waters,
it's
so
breathlessly
beyond
what
congress
has
said
in
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
whatever
view
it
took
in
james
was
dictum.
it
couldn't
be
clearer
that
the
accident
there
occurred
from
flood
waters,
in
the
real
sense
of
flood
waters.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
will
create
much
more
flood
storage
space.
unknown
speaker
it
will
create
more
flood
storage
space
by
releasing
into
the
canals,
but
i
don't
know
that
we
can
or
should
make
the
assumption
that
it
was
released
into
the
canals
for
that
purpose.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
true...
that's
true,
and
so
you
take
those
times
when
in
fact
the
san
joaquin
below
the
dam
is
filled
to
more
than
7,000...
what
is
it,
cubic
feet
per
second.
now,
when
we
look
at
those
days,
we
get
maybe...
i
don't
know
how
many
days
per
year,
but
not
all
that
many,
and
maybe
one
every
3
years
or
something,
but
let's
say
it's
100
days
a
year.
it's
not
more
than
that,
which
it
isn't
anywhere
near
that,
but
still,
let's
assume
that.
very
well.
on
those
100
days,
those
releases
put
water
in
the
canal
where
it
is
at
that
time
because
it
is
flood
water,
but
on
all
the
other
days
the
water
in
that
canal
is
not
where
it
is,
because
of
any
flood
control
purpose,
so
we're
talking
about
the
water
on
all
those
other
days.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
on
some
days.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
fine.
unknown
speaker
through
some
months.
how
many
months
you
want,
two?
unknown
speaker
excellent.
now
let's
talk
about
the
other
10
months.
the
other
10
months,
the
water,
on
your
theory,
is
not
where
it
is
in
the
canal
because
of
flood
control,
and
so
i
think
what
justice
souter
was
driving
at,
and
what
i
was,
if
all
the
water
in
the
canal
is
causing
that
damage,
what
reason
would
there
be
for
calling
the
water
in
those
other
10
months
flood
water
and
subjecting
it
to
immunity?
unknown
speaker
but
let
me
ask
you...
let
me
ask
you
a
hypothetical
i
have.
suppose
in
the
madera
canal
there's
a
valve,
and
it
goes
into
field
a
or
field
b.
both
are...
just
for
irrigation,
and
by
mistake
they
open
the
valve
and
it
goes
into
field
a
and
they
leave
it
open
for
24
hours
when
it's
only
12,
and
the
barn
gets
flooded.
immunity?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
water's
left
the
federal
project
in
this
case,
too.
unknown
speaker
it's
leaked
out
the
canal.
unknown
speaker
no.
no,
i'm
assuming
the
corps
of
engineers.
it's
a
hypothetical
case.
unknown
speaker
assume
the
corps
of
engineers
opens
the
valve
and
they
do
it
the
wrong
way.
unknown
speaker
instead
of
irrigating
field
a,
they
irrigate
field
b,
or
vice-versa,
and
there's
damage.
unknown
speaker
liability?
unknown
speaker
because
it's
flood
waters?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see--
unknown
speaker
--now...
well
then,
why
don't
you
win
in
this
case,
anyway?
unknown
speaker
but
on
a
theory
that
there's
a
new
flood.
so,
yeah,
overflow
is
basically
a
flood.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
if
every--
--let
me
just
change
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical--
unknown
speaker
--no,
no,
just
change
the
hypothetical
to
say
that
the
release
didn't
cause
a
flood,
it
didn't...
but
it
was
sudden
release
and
somebody
drowned
in
the
accident,
then
would
there
be
immunity?
unknown
speaker
there
would
be
immunity
there?
unknown
speaker
even
though
it
was
released
for
irrigation
purposes?
unknown
speaker
in
response
to
a
question
from
justice
souter
you
agreed
there
could
be
an
accident
where
there
wouldn't
be
immunity
attached.
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
example?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
so
it's
only
the
difference
between--
--but
it
would
be
covered
under
the
ninth
circuit
test,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
you
don't
really
support
the
ninth
circuit
test.
unknown
speaker
mr.
frederick,
may
i
go
back
to
your
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question?
i
take
it,
then,
that
the
only...
that
there
will
always
be
immunity
if
the
release
is,
in
fact,
an
intentional
release
as
opposed
to
the
negligent
release,
because
whenever
there
is
an
intentional
release,
as
i
understand
your
reasoning,
there
will
be,
in
fact,
the
creation
of
space
to
hold
flood
water.
unknown
speaker
and
so
that
the
only
case
in
which
there
will
be...
there
will
not
be
immunity
is
the
negligence
case,
as
in
your
example.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
just
gave--
unknown
speaker
--an
example
of
a
case
in
which
there
would
not
be
immunity.
unknown
speaker
a
negligence
case
like
the
negligence
case
you
just
posited
to
justice
stevens,
that
will
be
the
only
kind
of
situation
in
which
there
will
not
be
immunity?
unknown
speaker
but
wait--
unknown
speaker
--i'll
grant
you,
and
this
is
directly
related
to
what
was
just
said,
that
the
water
has
come
out
from
behind
the
dam
in
order
to
make
space
for
other
water.
that's
flood
control.
but
the
question
here
is,
the
water
that
came
out
from
the
dam
would
naturally
go
into
the
san
joaquin.
it
wouldn't
naturally
go
into
the
merced
canal,
and
if
you
focus
on
the
month
of
august,
and
you
focus
on
the
decision
to
turn
it
from
the
san
joaquin
below
the
dam
over
to
the
merced
canal,
what
has
that
to
do
with
flood
control?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
part
of
the
answer
that
it
allows
release
from
the
sacramento
into
the
san
joaquin,
which--
unknown
speaker
--greatly
alleviates
the
flood
waters
on
the
sacramento?
unknown
speaker
was
this
brought
out
at
trial?
unknown
speaker
we
rarely
affirm
on
an
alternate
ground.
unknown
speaker
--what
the
judgment
on
a
different
ground,
this
court
rarely
takes
submissions,
even
judicial
notice
submissions
as
a
matter
of
first
instance.
you
would
be
asking
us
to
sit
essentially
as
the
court
of
first
view
on
this
theory
and
to
look
at
things
that
were
never
presented
below,
and
that
is
an
extraordinary
thing
to
ask
this
court
to
do.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
don't
we
have
to
understand
the
terms
of
the
contract
where
they
have
class
i
water
and
class
ii
water
and
class
i
water
is
for
irrigation,
they
pay
a
higher...
or
they
pay
a
lower
rate,
i
guess,
or
a
higher
rate
for
class
i
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
want
us
to
know
about
water
being
in
two
classes?
unknown
speaker
but
often
it
hinges,
when
you're
talking
about
immunity
it
hinges
upon
factual
determinations
that
can
only
be
found
later.
that's
not
at
all
unusual.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
mr.
jones,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
was
the
shasta
dam
funded
and
constructed
by
the
bureau
of
reclamation?
