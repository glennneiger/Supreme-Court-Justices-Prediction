mr.
david
boies
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
begin
by
addressing
what
happened
in
the
beckstrom
case
that
mr.
klock
refers
to.
mr.
david
boies
yes.
mr.
david
boies
i
think,
your
honor,
and
obviously
this
court
and
the
florida
supreme
court
is
the
best
interpreter
of
that
opinion,
but
i
think
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
that
opinion
is
to
say
that
what
the
florida
supreme
court
meant
by
cognizant
is
that
it
was
taking
into
account
the
desire
to
get
the
election
over
in
time
so
that
everyone
would
have
the
advantage
of
the
safe
harbor.
i
think
that
goes
throughout
the
opinion.
mr.
david
boies
yes,
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
david
boies
except,
your
honor,
what
the
florida
supreme
court
did
i
think
in
its
opinion
is
to
say
that
in
terms
of
looking
at
how
to
remedy
the
situation,
it
needed
to
be
cognizant
of
the
fact
that
there
was
this
federal
deadline
out
there
that
was
going
to
affect
florida's
electors
if
that
deadline
was
not
met.
mr.
david
boies
yes,
but
what
i
would
say
is
that
whether
or
not
there
is
a
new
law,
that
is
whether
there's
a
change
in
the
enactment
in
the
language
of
the
statute
or
the
constitution,
is
something
that
has
to
be
decided
in
the
initial
instance
by
the
florida
supreme
court
interpreting
florida
law.
mr.
david
boies
i
don't
know
exactly
what
was
in
the
florida
supreme
court's
mind,
but
i
think
that
in
general
what
the
florida
supreme
court
made
quite
clear
is
that
the
thing
that
was
constraining
it
was
the
desire
to
fit
its
remedy
within
the
safe
harbor
provision.
mr.
david
boies
yes,
your
honor,
yes,
i
think
that's
right.
and
i
think
it
does
not
reflect
a
desire
to
change
the
law
or
in
any
way
affect
what
the
substantive
law
is.
what
the
court
is
saying
is....
mr.
david
boies
you
mean
by
shortening
it?
mr.
david
boies
i
think
that
it
would
be
unusual.
i
haven't
really
thought
about
that
question.
i
think
they
probably
could
not....
mr.
david
boies
yes,
because
it
would
be
a
legislative
enactment
as
opposed
to
a
judicial
interpretation
of
an
existing
law.
remember....
mr.
david
boies
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
if
you
go
back
to
the
state
against
chappell
in
1988,
where
the
florida
supreme
court
faced
the
very
question
of
whether
or
not
that
sevenday
period
was
an
iron
curtain
that
came
down,
the
florida
supreme
court
said
it
was
not.
the
florida
supreme
court
said
that
you
had
to
look
as
to
whether
there
was
substantial
compliance.
in
that
case
three
days
was
found
to
be
substantial
compliance.
that
was
a
situation
in
which
there
was
telephone
notice,
which
was
not
adequate
for
certification.
that
was
then
followed
up....
mr.
david
boies
except
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
it
wasn't
doing
exactly
the
same
thing
because
it
wasn't
passing
a
new
law.
it
was
interpreting
the
existing
law.
if
the
legislature
had
said,
for
example
the
legislature....
mr.
david
boies
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
if
the
supreme
court
had
rewritten
the
law
the
way
you
hypothesized
the
legislature
rewrote
the
law,
it
might
very
well
be
a
difference.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
florida
supreme
court
did
not
rewrite
the
law
in
the
way
that
you
hypothesized.
what
the
florida
supreme
court
was
confronted
with
was
a
statute,
and
that
statute
said
that...
and
it
was
the
later
passed
statute,
we
get
back
into
the
may
and
the
shall.
the
may
statute
was
the
later
passed
statute,
and
so
what
the
florida
supreme
court
said
is
we
have
to
look
at
what
is
the
criteria
by
which
you
decide
whether
you
may
ignore
and
will
ignore
these
returns,
and
what
the
florida
supreme
court
said,
we're
going
to
interpret
that
exactly
the
way
we've
interpreted
it
for
25
years,
and
12
years
before
the
florida
supreme
court
made
this
decision,
it
had
made
the
state
against
chappell
decision
in
which
it
had
approached
it
from
exactly
the
same
policy
grounds.
mr.
david
boies
i
think
the
way
i
would
put
it,
your
honor,
is
that
if
you
conclude
that
the
florida
supreme
court's
interpretation
of
florida
law
is
either
a
sham
or
it
is
so
misguided
that
it
is
simply
untenable
in
any
sense....
mr.
david
boies
i
think
at
that
point
then
you
can
conclude
that
what
it
has
done
is
it
has
changed
the
law,
but
i
think
the
standard
is
the
standard
this
court
has
generally
applied
in
giving
deference
to
state
supreme
court
decisions.
mr.
david
boies
i
think,
your
honor,
that
if
the
florida
supreme
court
in
interpreting
the
florida
law,
i
think
the
court
needs
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
the
legislature
does
have
this
plenary
power.
i
think
when
the
florida
supreme
court
does
that,
if
it
does
so
within
the
normal
ambit
of
judicial
interpretation,
that
is
a
subject
for
florida's
supreme
court
to
take.
mr.
david
boies
i
think
there
is
in
a
sense,
your
honor,
and
i
think
the
florida
supreme
court
was
grappling
with
that.
mr.
david
boies
i
think
it
did
do
it
properly.
mr.
david
boies
your
honor,
if
i
could,
one
of
the
things
that
was
argued
from
the
beginning
by
governor
bush's
counsel
and
accepted
by
the
florida
supreme
court
was
that
the
protest
statute
and
the
contest
statute
were
very
separate
procedures.
there
was
a
time
limit
in
the
protest
contest
prior
to
certification,
but
there
is
no
time
limit
in
the
contest
statute
process,
which
is
what
we
are
in
now,
and
i
think
that
the
florida
supreme
court
was
focusing
on
this
contest
period,
which
is
what
is
really
before,
was
before
them
and
is
before
you,
and
in
the
contest--
mr.
david
boies
--well,
there
are
three
different
groups
of
votes,
okay?
and
with
respect...
broward,
palm
beach,
and
miamidade.
with
respect
to
miamidade
and
palm
beach,
there
was
a
trial.
there
was
a
contest
trial.
it
is
the
appeal
from
that
trial
that
is
before
this
court.
and
the
petitioners
don't
really
refer
to
what's
in
the
trial
record
but
in
that
trial
record,
there
was
undisputed
evidence
that
the
votes
that
were
counted
there
were
valid
legal
votes.
now,
whether
those
votes
were
counted
as
part
of
the
certification
process
or
not....
mr.
david
boies
once
you
know
they
are
valid
votes....
mr.
david
boies
yes.
no.
in
the
circuit
court
of
leon
county.
because
it's
a
statewide
election,
the
contest
procedure
takes
you
to
leon
county,
regardless
of
where
the
votes
are
cast.
but
what
the,
what
the,
what
the
court
found
there,
and
there
was
undisputed
evidence,
and
mr.
richard,
who
was
governor
bush's
counsel
here,
conceded
that
the
palm
beach
board
had
applied
the
appropriate
standard
in
identifying
votes,
the
socalled
215
additional
net
votes
for
vice
president
gore
and
senator
lieberman.
what
you
had
there
was
undisputed
evidence,
it
was
found
as
a
matter
of
fact,
and
the
supreme
court
reviewing
that
trial
said
you've
had
these
votes
identified
by
miamidade,
168
net
votes,
by
palm
beach,
215
net
votes,
and
those
votes
need
to
be
included.
not
because....
mr.
david
boies
--it's
a
part
of
the
certification
process.
mr.
david
boies
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
boies
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
when
you
look
at
the
contest
statute,
it
is
a
contest
of
the
certification.
that
is,
the
process
is
the
results
are
certified
and
then
what
happens
is
you
contest
whether
that
certification
is
right.
mr.
david
boies
but
that's
true
in
any
contest.
every
single
contest....
mr.
david
boies
yes,
of
course
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
david
boies
yes.
because
the
contest
procedure
is
a
procedure
to
contest
the
certification.
what
you
are
doing
is
you
are
saying
this
certification
is
wrong.
change
it.
that's
what
every
contest
proceeding
is.
and
what
the
florida
supreme
court
was
saying
after
this
trial
is
yes,
you
proved
that
this
certification
is
missing
250
votes.
mr.
david
boies
but,
but
your
honor,
that
is
what
happens
every
time
there
is
a
successful
contest.
the
contest
is
a
contest
of
the
certification.
you
have
the
certification
results
first.
mr.
david
boies
right.
mr.
david
boies
i
think
you
get
to
exactly
the
same
place.
mr.
david
boies
i
think
it
doesn't
really
matter
what
they
said.
mr.
david
boies
but
broward
might.
mr.
david
boies
broward
is
a
different
situation.
mr.
david
boies
with
respect
to
broward,
what
you
have
is
you
have
these
votes
that
have
been
counted,
and
were
included
in
the
certification,
and
if
were
you
to
assume
that
that
certification
that
came
in
on
november
26th
is
somehow
void,
then
those
ballots
would
have
to
be
considered
just
like
the
dade
and
palm
beach
ballots,
so
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
between
broward
and....
mr.
david
boies
i
do,
your
honor.
i
think
there
must
be
a
uniform
standard.
i
think
there
is
a
uniform
standard.
the
question
is
whether
that
standard
is
too
general
or
not.
the
standard
is
whether
or
not
the
intent
of
the
voter
is
reflected
by
the
ballot.
that
is
the
uniform
standard
throughout
the
state
of
florida.
mr.
david
boies
i
think....
mr.
david
boies
i
think
it
can
vary
from
individual
to
individual.
i
think
that
just
as
these
findings....
mr.
david
boies
i
think
on
the
margin,
on
the
margin,
your
honor,
whenever
you
are
interpreting
intent,
whether
it
is
in
the
criminal
law,
an
administrative
practice,
whether
it
is
in
local
government,
whenever
somebody
is
coming
to
government....
mr.
david
boies
with
respect,
it
is
susceptible
of
a
more
specific
standard,
and
some
states,
like
texas,
have
given
a
statutory
definition,
although
even
in
texas,
there
is
a
catchall
that
says
anything
else
that
clearly
specifies
the
intent
of
the
voter.
so
even,
even
where
states
have
approached
this
in
an
attempt
to
give
specificity,
they
have
ended
up
with
a
catchall
provision
that
says
look
at
the
intent
of
the
voter.
mr.
david
boies
let
me
answer
both
questions.
first,
i
don't
think
there
is
a
series
of
objective
interpretations,
objective
criteria
that
would
vary
county
by
county.
mr.
david
boies
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
times
in
the
law
in
which
there
can
be
those
variations
from
jury
to
jury,
from
public
official
to
public
official.
mr.
david
boies
i
don't
think,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because...
and
maybe
i
am
quarreling
with
a
premise
that
says
there
are
these
objective
criteria.
maybe
if
you
had
specific
objective
criteria
in
one
county
that
says
we're
going
to
count
indented
ballots
and
another
county
that
said
we're
only
going
to
count
the
ballot
if
it
is
punched
through.
if
you
knew
you
had
those
two
objective
standards
and
they
were
different,
then
you
might
have
an
equal
protection
problem.
mr.
david
boies
well,
i
think
that's
a
very
hard
question.
mr.
david
boies
i
would
tell
them
to
count
every
vote.
mr.
david
boies
i
think,
i
think
i
would
say
that
if
you're
looking
for
a
standard,
and
i
say
that
not
because
of
the
particular
aspects
of
this
election...
the
texas
standard,
if
you
wanted
to
specify
something
that
was
specific,
gives
you
a
pretty
good
standard.
mr.
david
boies
yes,
that's
what
i
was
going
to
say,
your
honor,
that
what
you
have
here
is
you
have
a
series
of
decisions
that
people
get
a
right
to
object
to
is
all
going
through
a
process,
the
people
are
there.
they
submit
written
objections,
and
then
that's
going
to
be
reviewed
by
a
court.
mr.
david
boies
your
honor,
i
think
what
the
court
held
was
not
include
both
broward
and
palm
beach.
i
think
it
was
palm
beach
and
miamidade,
because
broward
was
not
part
of
the
trial
because
broward
had
been
certified,
and
with
respect
to
miamidade
and
palm
beach,
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
that
was
a
different
standard.
i
don't...
and
there's
no
finding
at
the
trial
court
that
that
was
a
different
standard.
indeed,
what
the
trial
court
found
was
that
both
miamidade
and
palm
beach
properly
exercised
their
counting
responsibilities,
so
i
don't
think....
mr.
david
boies
i
believe
what
he
meant,
it
was
discerning
the
clear
intent
of
the
voter,
which
is
what
they
were
both
attempting
to
do.
mr.
david
boies
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
boies
yes,
that
is,
that
is
right,
but
he
did
so
based
on
what
the
florida
supreme
court
held,
and
what
six
justices
of
the
florida
supreme
court
held
were
two
errors
of
law.
first,
that
we
had
to
prove
before
he
looked
at
the
ballots
that
there
was
a
probability
that
the
election
result
would
be
changed,
and
second,
that
we
had
to
prove
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
david
boies
yes,
he
did.
mr.
david
boies
with
respect
to
this
he
said...
he
said
it
separately
with
respect
to
miamidade
and
palm
beach.
because
he
found
that
they
had
properly
exercised
their
discretion.
the
palm
beach
chairman
of
the
canvassing
board
actually
was
a
witness,
judge
burton.
he
came
and
testified,
and
he
testified
that
they
used
a
clear
intent
of
the
voter
standard.
mr.
david
boies
yes,
just
intent.
they
used
clear
intent
of
the
voter.
and
the
statute,
sometimes,
in
one
section
says
clear
intent
of
the
voter.
that's
the
one
that
petitioners'
counsel
is
referring
to.
in
166,
it
refers
in
subsection
7(b)
to
the
intent
of
the
voter,
but
palm
beach
used
the
clear
intent
of
the
voter
and
found
hundreds
of
ballots
that
they
could
discern
the
clear
intent
of
the
voter
from
that
were
not
machine
read.
now,
in
doing
so,
they
were
applying
florida
law,
and
like
the
law
of
many
states,
it
has
a
general
standard,
not
a
specific
standard.
mr.
david
boies
well,
what
he
testified
is
that
you
looked
at
the
entire
ballot,
that
if
you
found
something
that
was
punched
through
all
the
way
in
many
races,
but
just
indented
in
one
race,
you
didn't
count
that
indentation,
because
you
saw
that
the
voter
could
punch
it
through
when
the
voter
wanted
to.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
found
a
ballot
that
was
indented
all
the
way
through,
you
counted
that
as
the
intent
of
the
voter.
mr.
david
boies
with
no
holes
punched,
but,
but
where
it
was
indented
in
every
way.
mr.
david
boies
in
palm
beach.
mr.
david
boies
another,
another
thing
that
they
counted
was
he
said
they
discerned
what
voters
sometimes
did
was
instead
of
properly
putting
the
ballot
in
where
it
was
supposed
to
be,
they
laid
it
on
top,
and
then
what
you
would
do
is
you
would
find
the
punches
went
not
through
the
socalled
chad,
but
through
the
number.
mr.
david
boies
well,
your
honor,
because
in
florida
law,
since
1917,
darby
against
state,
the
florida
supreme
court
has
held
that
where
a
voter's
intent
can
be
discerned,
even
if
they
don't
do
what
they're
told,
that's
supposed
to
be
counted,
and
the
thing
i
wanted
to
say
about
the
beckstrom
case
is
that
was
a
case
that
used
optical
ballots.
voters
were
told,
fill
it
in
with
a
number
two
pencil.
several
thousand
didn't.
they
used
everything
else,
but
not
a
number
two
pencil.
and
so
the
machine
wouldn't
read
it.
it
was
voter
error.
the
supreme
court
in
1998,
well
before
this
election,
said
you've
got
to
count
those
votes.
and
in
fact,
they
counted
those
votes
even
though
the
way
the
canvassing
board
dealt
with
them
was
to
go
back
and
mark
them
over
with
a
big
black
marker,
which
made
it
impossible
to
check
whether
the
canvassing
board
had
really
just
marked
over
the
ballot
or
had
put
a
new
mark
on
the
ballot.
mr.
david
boies
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
boies
your
honor,
the
de
novo
review
is
in
the
contest
phase,
and
neither
volusia
county
nor
broward
county
was
a
contest
filed.
what
the
supreme
court
holds
is
that
you've
got
de
novo
review
in
a
contest.
a
contest
relates
to
specific
ballots
that
are
contested.
the
ballots
in
broward
and
volusia
were
not
contested
by
any
party.
mr.
david
boies
no.
it's
only
based
on
the--
mr.
david
boies
--no.
it's
only
based
on
the
certifications
that
are
contested.
in
other
words,
if
you
are
going
to
order
the
manual
review
of
the
ballots,
the
issue
is
what
ballots
are
contested,
and
second,
is
there
a
judicial
review
of
those
ballots.
mr.
david
boies
yes.
but
you--
mr.
david
boies
--yes.
that's
true.
mr.
david
boies
and
you
had
a
certification.
mr.
david
boies
i
think
what
the
supreme
court
is
saying
is
you
have
got
a
certification.
that
certification
shows
a
certain
vote
total.
now,
you
take
that
certification
until
it
is
contested,
and
it
can
be
contested
by
either
or
both
parties.
you
do
not
have,
until
it
is
contested,
you
do
not
have
contested
ballots.
once
have
you
contested
ballots,
then
going
back
to
state
against
williams,
nuccio
against
williams
in
1929,
cited
in
our
papers,
then
it
becomes
a
judicial
question,
and
what
the
court
holds
is
you
then
look
at
that
as
a
judicial
matter
and
that
is
why
you
have
going
on
in
leon
county
the
review
of
the
miamidade
ballots
under
the
court's
supervision.
now,
i
would
point
out
that
we
asked
to
have
the
miamidade
ballots
reviewed.
we
also
asked
to
have
the
3,300
palm
beach
ballots
reviewed,
but
the
supreme
court
said
no
to
us
on
that.
they
said
yes,
you
can
have
the
9,000
miamidade
ballots
reviewed.
they
also
said,
which
we
didn't
ask
for,
they
said
as
a
matter
of
remedy,
we
want
to
review
the
undervotes
all
around
the
state.
mr.
david
boies
no.
that
is
a
result
of
adding
the
socalled
undervotes
that
were
mentioned
and
the
socalled
overvotes
that
were
mentioned.
either
an
undervote
where
no
vote
registers
for
president
or
an
overvote
where
two
or
more
registers
for
president
are
discarded,
because
you
can't
vote
twice,
and
if
you
vote
not
at
all,
and
in
either
circumstance,
your
vote
doesn't
get
counted.
mr.
david
boies
it's
approximately
60,000,
i
think,
your
honor.
it
turns
out
to
be
less
than
that
because
of
the
recounts
that
have
already
been
completed,
but
i
think
the
total
sort
of
blank
ballots
for
the
presidency
start
at
around
60,000.
mr.
david
boies
that's
right.
mr.
david
boies
well
first,
nobody
asked
for
a
contest
of
the
overvotes,
and
the
contest
statute
begins
with
a
party
saying
that
there
is
either
a
rejection
of
legal
votes
or
an
acceptance
of
illegal
votes.
mr.
david
boies
two
parts
to
the
answer.
the
reason
that
i
said
what
i
did
to
justice
scalia
was
that
i
think
that
if
this
court
were
to
rule
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
statewide
recounts,
that
they
were
being
done
by
canvassing
boards
as
opposed
to
directly
by
the
court,
or
because
the
court
was
not
supervising
the
particular
expression
of
voter
intent,
what
the
court
would
have
done
is
simply
cut
back
on
a
remedy
that
we
didn't
ask
for.
the
second
part
is
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
overvotes,
remember,
this
is
a
machine
issue.
when
you
are
dealing
with
overvotes,
the
machine
has
already
registered
two
votes.
now,
there
may
be
another
vote
there,
a
dimpled
vote
or
an
indented
vote
that
the
machine
did
not
register.
but
once
you
get
two
votes,
that
ballot
doesn't
get
counted
for
the
presidency.
mr.
david
boies
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
suggests
that
there
are
such
votes.
if
anybody
had
contested
the
overvotes,
it
would
have
been
a
relatively
simple
process
to
test
that
because
you
could
simply
test
it
as
to
whether
the
double
vote
was
a
writein
vote
or
was
another
candidate.
mr.
david
boies
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
that's
the
way
i
would
interpret
it,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
boies
it's
not
meaningless.
it
becomes
the
baseline,
and
in
every
contest
that
has
ever
taken
place,
including
this
one,
that
has
been
the
baseline
that
has
determined
99-plus
percent
of
the
votes,
and
what
is
contested
are
simply
those
ballots
that
during
the
protest
phase
have
been
identified
as
disputed
ballots,
so
that
the,
the
protest
phase
solves
99
percent
of
the
election
or
more.
what
is
left
over
are
those
ballots
that
one
side
or
the
other
has
contested,
and
that's
what
the
contest
deals
with.
mr.
david
boies
but,
your
honor,
at
this...
leaving
aside
the
prior
case
about
the
extension
of
the
time
for
certification,
which
i
think
at
this
stage
you
have
to
leave
aside
because
at
the
contest
stage,
what
you
are
doing
is
you
are
contesting
specific
ballots
whether
or
not
they
were
included
in
the
certification.
it's
absolutely
clear
under
florida
law
that
that's
what
the
contest
is
about,
so
at
the
contest
stage,
the
only
question
is
can
you
complete
the
contest
of
the
contested
ballots
in
the
time
available?
everything
that's
in
the
record
is,
that
we
could
have
and
indeed
we
still
may
be
able
to,
if
that
count
can
go
forward.
mr.
david
boies
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
david
boies
your
honor,
i
think,
i
think
the
appeal
to
the
florida
supreme
court
could
have
and
indeed
the
schedule
that
was
set
up
would
have
made
that
quite
possible.
there
is
about
another
day
or
so,
except
for,
except
for
four
or
five
counties,
all
of
the
counties
would
be
completed
in
about
another
day.
and
maybe
even
those
counties
could
be
now
because
as
i
understand
it
some
of
them
have
taken
advantage
of
the
time
to
get
the
procedures
ready
to
count.
mr.
david
boies
yes,
your
honor,
but
as
we
did
in
this
court,
we
have
done
in
the
florida
supreme
court
a
number
of
times
and
that
is
to
do
the
briefs
and
have
the
argument
the
next
day
and
a
decision
within
24
hours.
mr.
david
boies
to
the
extent
that
there
are
contested
or
disputed
ballots....
mr.
david
boies
--i
think
that
may
be
so,
your
honor.
mr.
david
boies
we
believe
that
it
could
be
done
in
the
time
available.
we
also
believe
that
we
have
available
to
us
the
argument
that
says
you
finished
what
we
contested.
although
the
supreme
court
has
said
as
a
matter
of
remedy
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
do
these
other
things
that
nobody
asked
for,
that
if
it
gets
down
to
the
point
where
you
can...
you
have
done
the
contest
and
you
simply
have
not
gotten
completed
all
of
this
other
remedy
under
168
subsection
8,
that
we
are
still
entitled
under
settled
florida
law
to
have
our
votes
counted.
mr.
david
boies
i
think
that
what....
mr.
david
boies
i
did,
your
honor.
i
think
that
what
they
were
saying
is
that
as
a
matter
of
remedy
this
is
the
fairest
way
to
do
it.
i
don't
think
they
were
saying
that
it
would
violate
fundamental
fairness
to
only
take
into
account
what
you
could
get
done
in
the
time
available.
there's
nothing
in
the
supreme
court
opinion
that
would
suggest
this.
mr.
david
boies
right.
mr.
david
boies
if
you've
identified
the
ballots,
you
could
presumably
wait
and
do
it
at
the
contest
phase.
there's
no
particular
advantage
to
doing
that.
the
fact....
mr.
david
boies
your
honor....
mr.
david
boies
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
that
is
right.
i
would
point
out
that....
mr.
david
boies
your
honor,
i
think
the
boardman
case
relates
not
to
the
counting
of
votes,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
standard
in
terms
of
the
intent
of
the
voter.
the
boardman
case,
the
language
that
you're
referring
to
is
at
page
268
of
the
southern
reporter
report
of
that
case,
and
what
is
clear
from
that
page
and
that
discussion
is
it's
dealing
with
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
because
the
canvassing
board
threw
away
the
envelopes
from
the
absentee
ballots
so
they
could
not
be
checked,
whether
that
invalidated
the
absentee
ballots,
and
the
court
says
no,
it
doesn't,
because
it's
important
to
count
all
these
votes,
and
because
we
assume
that
what
they
were
doing
was
proper.
that
does
not,
i
respectfully
suggest,
at
all
deal
with
the
question
of
deference
to
the
voter
intent
determination
which
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
is
a
matter
for
judicial
determination.
the
other
thing
that
i
would
say
with
respect
to
intent
is
i
know
the
court
is
concerned
about
whether
the
standard
is
too
general
or
not.
some
states
have
made
specific
criteria
their
law.
other
states,
not
just
florida...
10
or
11
of
them,
including
massachusetts,
in
the
dellahunt
case
that
we
cited,
has
stuck
with
this
very
general
standard.
mr.
david
boies
there's
a
sense
where
that
may
be
an
article
ii
issue.
mr.
david
boies
yes.
i
do
not
believe
that
that
would
violate
the
equal
protection
of
due
process
clause.
that
distinction
between
how
they
interpret
the
intent
of
the
voter
standard
is
going
to
have
a
lot
less
effect
on
how
votes
are
treated
than
the
mere
difference
in
the
types
of
machines
that
are
used.
mr.
david
boies
no,
i
think
it
is
an
answer.
i
think
there
are
two
answers
to
it.
first,
i
think
that
the
answer
that
they
did
it
differently,
different
people
interpreting
the
general
standard
differently,
would
not
raise
a
problem
even
in
the
absence
of
judicial
review
of
that.
second,
even
if
that
would
have
raised
a
constitutional
problem,
i
think
the
judicial
review
that
provides
the
standardization
would
solve
that
problem.
the
third
thing
that
i
was
saying
is
that
any
differences
as
to
how
this
standard
is
interpreted
have
a
lot
less
significance
in
terms
of
what
votes
are
counted
or
not
counted
than
simply
the
differences
in
machines
that
exist
throughout
the
counties
of
florida.
there
are
five
times
as
many
undervotes
in
punch
card
ballot
counties
than
in
optical
ballot
counties.
now,
for
whatever
that
reason
is,
whether
it's
voter
error
or
machine
problems,
that
statistic,
you
know,
makes
clear
that
there
is
some
difference
in
how
votes
are
being
treated
county
by
county.
that
difference
is
much
greater
than
the
difference
in
how
many
votes
are
recovered
in
palm
beach
or
broward
or
volusia
or
miamidade,
so
that
the
differences
of
interpretation
of
the
standard,
the
general
standard
are
resulting
in
far
fewer
differences
among
counties
than
simply
the
differences
in
the
machines
that
they
have.
mr.
david
boies
thank
you
very
much.
