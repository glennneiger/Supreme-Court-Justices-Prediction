justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
pretty
close.
you
can
say
it
could
be
interpreted
that
way
by
the
florida
supreme
court,
i
suppose.
you
think
it
must
be?
or
is
your
point
that
even
in
close
calls
we
have
to
revisit
the
florida
supreme
court's
opinion?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
olson....
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
also
part
of
your
case,
is
it
not,
that
insofar
as
that
language
just
quoted
is
concerned,
the
power
of
the
circuit
judge
to
prevent
or
correct
any
alleged
wrong,
it's
part
of
your
submission,
i
think,
that
there
is
no
wrong
when
a
machine
does
not
count
those
ballots
that
it's
not
supposed
to
count?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
voters
are
instructed
to
detach
the
chads
entirely,
and
the
machine,
as
predicted,
does
not
count
those
chads
where
those
instructions
are
not
followed,
there
isn't
any
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
florida
court
accepted
that,
too,
in
its
current
opinion.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
klock...
i'm
scalia.
justice
antonin
scalia
correct
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
i
had
thought
that
although
you
don't
take
into
account
improperly
marked
ballots
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
there
will
be
a
manual
recount,
i
had
thought
that
when
there
is
a
manual
recount
for
some
other
reason,
and
you
come
across
ballots
of
this
sort
that
you
can
count
them,
that
for
that
purpose
you
can
decide
oh,
look
at,
there
is
a
hanging
chad.
the
machine
didn't
count
it.
it's
clear
what
the
intent
of
the
voter
are.
we'll
count
it.
is
that
not
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
was
quite
a
different...
i
mean,
there,
indeed,
telephone
notification
had
been
given
within
the
deadline,
and
the
actual
written
material
was
not
submitted
until
a
few
days
after.
i
think
that's
quite
a
bit
different
from
extending
the
period
generally
and
for
all
submissions
for,
you
know...
but
if
i
could...
i'm
not
sure
that
you
and
justice
kennedy
are
disagreeing
on
very
much.
it
seems
to
me
you
acknowledge
that
if
the
florida
supreme
court's
interpretation
of
this
law
were
not
a
reasonable
interpretation,
just
not
one
that
would
pass
normal
judicial
muster,
then
it
would
be
just
like
the
legislature
writing
a
new
law,
but
your
contention
here
is
that
this
is
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
florida
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
not
only
said....
justice
antonin
scalia
it
not
only
said
that.
it
said
that
those
votes
have
to
be
certified.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
said
that
those
votes
had
to
be
certified,
which
certainly
contravenes
our
vacating
of
their
prior
order.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
but
this,
but
what
the
florida
supreme
court
said
is
that
there
shall
be
added
to
the
certification
these
additional
numbers.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
added
to
the
certification.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
may
do
review
of
the
ballots
and
add
more
numbers,
but
as
i
read
the
florida
supreme
court
opinion,
it
said
the
secretary
of
state
will
certify
these
additional....
justice
antonin
scalia
the
certification
as
rendered
by
the
secretary
of
state
did
not
include
those
additional
ballots
for
your
client,
and
the
supreme
court
directed
that
the
certification
would
be
changed
to
include
those.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
me.
you
have
a
certification
which
is
made
by
the
secretary
of
state.
that
is
what
is
contested.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
here
the
certification
was
directed
to
be
changed.
let....
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
tell
them
to
count
every
vote.
we're
telling
them
to
count
every
vote.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
all
right.
that
causes
me
some
problems
that
pertain
not
just
to
the
equal
protection
aspect
of
this,
but
to
the
rationality
of
the
supreme
court's
opinion,
because
the
supreme
court
opinion
on
the
one
hand
said,
as
you've
just
repeated,
that
there
was
to
be
de
novo
review
by
the
circuit
judge
in
leon
county.
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
said
that
he
had
to
accept
the
counts
that
had
come
out
of
palm
beach
and
broward
counties.
it
was
clear
that
broward
and
palm
beach
counties
had
applied
different
criteria
to
dimpled
ballots.
one
of
them
was
counting
all
dimpled
ballots,
the
other
one
plainly
was
not.
how
can
you
at
one
and
the
same
time
say
it's
a
de
novo
standard
as
to
what
is
the
intent
of
the
voter,
and
on
the
other
hand
say,
you
have
to
accept,
give
some
deference
to,
quite
differing
standards
by
two
different
counties?
that's
just
not
rational.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean?
properly
exercised
what?
their
discretion,
right?
is
that
what
he
meant
by
counting
responsibilities?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
boies,
can
i
come
back
to
this
discrepancy
between
palm
beach
and
broward
county?
i'm
reading
from
footnote
16
of
the
florida
supreme
court's
opinion.
on
november
9,
2000,
a
manual
recount
was
requested
on
behalf
of
vice
president
gore
in
four
counties...
miamidade,
broward,
palm
beach,
and
volusia.
broward
county
and
volusia
county
timely
completed
a
manual
recount.
it
is
undisputed
that
the
results
of
the
manual
recounts
in
volusia
county
and
broward
county
were
included
in
the
statewide
certifications.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
those
statewide
certifications
the
supreme
court
ordered
to
be
accepted.
so
it
is...
the
supreme
court,
while
applying
a
standard
of
supposedly
de
novo
review
of
the
certifications,
is
requiring
the
circuit
court
to
accept
both
broward
county,
which
does
one
thing
with
dimpled
ballots,
and
palm
beach
county,
which
does
something
clearly
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
determination
that
the
circuit
court
has
to
make
about
whether
it's
necessary
to
have
a
recount
is
based
upon
the
certifications.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
he
then
accepts--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
have
to
know
how
close
the
state
election
was,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
which
purpose
you'll
accept
the
certifications.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
here--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
here
you
are
telling
him
to
accept
it
not
de
novo,
but
deferring
to
broward
county.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
boies,
i
have
one
other
perplexity
about
the
scheme
that's
been
set
up
here.
what...
there
is
a
very,
as
you
point
out,
there
is
scant
statutory
provision
concerning,
concerning
the
contest.
there
is
quite
detailed
statutory
provision
concerning
the
protest
period.
and
it
tells
everybody
how
to
act
and
time
limits
and
all
of
that.
why
would
anyone
bother
to
go
through
the
protest
period,
have
these
ballots
counted
by
the
canvassing
boards,
have
them
certify
the
results?
why
go
through
all
that
when
the
whole
thing
begins
again
with
a
contest?
there
is
no,
no...
once
a
contest
filed,
the
certification
is
meaningless.
what
advantage
is
there
to
win
the
protest?
justice
antonin
scalia
after
the
counts
are
conducted
in
the
individual
counties,
wouldn't
the
leon
county
circuit
judge
have
to
review
those
counts?
after
all,
it's...
i
mean,
the
purpose
of
the
scheme
is
to
have
a
uniform
determination.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wouldn't
that
take
a
fair
amount
of
time
and
is
that
delegable?
i
assume
he
would
have
to
do
that
personally.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
boies,
would
you
explain
to
me
again
how
the
protest
and
the
contest
fits
in.
you
said
that
the...
let's
assume
that
my
complaint
that
i
want
to
protest
is
the
failure
to
do
undercounts
to
those
ballots
that
were
undercounted,
okay?
that's
my
protest.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
i
ever
bring
that
in
a
protest
proceeding?
why
wouldn't
i
just
go
right
to
the
contest
because
it
doesn't
matter
whether
i
win
or
lose
the
protest
proceeding.
it's
de
novo
at
the
contest
stage.
what
possible
advantage
is
there
to
go
through
the
protest
proceeding?
