justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--can
you
begin
by
telling
us
our
federal
jurisdiction,
where
is
the
federal
question
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
the
first,
it
seems
to
me
essential
to
the
republican
theory
of
government
that
the
constitutions
of
the
united
states
and
the
states
are
the
basic
charter,
and
to
say
that
the
legislature
of
the
state
is
unmoored
from
its
own
constitution
and
it
can't
use
its
courts,
and
it
can't
use
its
executive
agency,
even
you,
your
side,
concedes
it
can
use
the
state
agencies,
it
seems
to
me
a
holding
which
has
grave
implications
for
our
republican
theory
of
government.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
why
didn't
it
do
that
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
this
is
serious
business
because
it
indicates
how
unmoored,
untethered
the
legislature
is
from
the
constitution
of
its
own
state,
and
it
makes
every
state
law
issue
a
federal
question.
can
you
use
this
theory
and
say
that
it
creates
some
sort
of
presumption
of
validity
that
allows
us
to
see
whether
this
court
or
the
executive
has
gone
too
far?
is
that
what
you're
arguing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
and
i
thought
your
point
was
that
the
process
is
being
conducted
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
it
is
standardless.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand
that
she
has
the
expertise
and
let's
assume
that
under
florida
state
law
she's
the
one
with
the
presumptive
competence
to
set
the
standard.
is
there
a
place
in
the
florida
scheme
for
her
to
do
this
in
the
contest
period?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
in
the
contest
period?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
if
there's....
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
we
begin
with
jurisdiction,
first?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
supreme
court
of
florida
said
that
it
took,
that
it
was
cognizant,
and
the
legislature
was
cognizant
of
3
u.s.c.
section
5.
and
for
convenience
sake,
let's
call
that
new
law.
that's
not
exactly
the--
--when
the
supreme
court
used
that
word,
i
assume
it
used
it
in
a
legal
sense.
cognizance
means
to
take
jurisdiction
of,
to
take
authoritative
notice.
why
doesn't
that
constitute
an
acceptance
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
proposition
that
3
usc
section
5
must
be
interpreted
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
language
used
in
3
usc
section
5
is
garden
variety
language
so
far
as
the
courts
are
concerned.
we
can
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
a
new
law
or
an
old
law.
that's
completely
susceptible
of
judicial
interpretation,
is
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
florida
court,
and
presumably
the
florida
legislature
have
acted
with
reference
to
3
usc
section
5
that
it
presents
now
a
federal
question
for
us
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
or
is
not
a
new
law
by
reason
of
the
various
florida
supreme...
two
florida
supreme
court
decisions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course
the
deadline
is
meaningless
if
there's
a
new
law
involved.
that's
part
of
the
equation,
too.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask,
could
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
florida,
after
this
election,
have
enacted
a
statute
to
change
the
contest
period
by
truncating
it
by
19
days?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
without
contravening
the
section
which
says
that
there
should
be
no
new
law
for
the
safe
harbor?
could
the
florida
supreme
court
have
done
what
the...
could
the
florida
legislature
have
done
what
the
supreme
court
did?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
consistently,
because
that
would
be
a
new
law
under
section
5,
wouldn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
fact
it
would
be
a
new
law
under
our
preclearance
jurisprudence,
wouldn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
we
assume
the
legislature
would
run
contrary
to
the
new
law
prohibition
in
the
statute,
wouldn't
the
supreme
court
do
it
if
it
does
exactly
the
same
thing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
why...
if
the
legislature
does
it
it's
a
new
law
and
when
the
supreme
court
does
it,
it
isn't.
both
would
have
to
require...
you
have
to
preclear
judicial
rulings
and
see
whether
they
make
new
laws,
don't
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
that
in
the
contest
phase,
there
must
be
a
uniform
standard
for
counting
the
ballots?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
very
general.
it
runs
throughout
the
law.
even
a
dog
knows
the
difference
in
being
stumbled
over
and
being
kicked.
we
know
it,
yes.
in
this
case...
in
this
case
what
we
are
concerned
with
is
an
intent
that
focuses
on
this
little
piece
of
paper
called
a
ballot,
and
you
would
say
that
from
the
standpoint
of
equal
protection
clause,
could
each
county
give
their
own
interpretation
to
what
intent
means,
so
long
as
they
are
in
good
faith
and
with
some
reasonable
basis
finding
intent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
that
vary
from
county
to
county?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that,
so
that
even
in
one
county
can
vary
from
table
to
table
on
counting
these
ballots?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
here
you
have
something
objective.
you
are
not
just
reading
a
person's
mind.
you
are
looking
at
a
piece
of
paper,
and
the
supreme
courts
in
the
states
of
south
dakota
and
the
other
cases
have
told
us
that
you
will
count
this
if
it's
hanging
by
two
corners
or
one
corner,
this
is
susceptible
of
a
uniform
standard,
and
yet
you
say
it
can
vary
from
table
to
table
within
the
same
county.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
as
a
matter
of
remedy
it's
ordered
a
statewide
recount
in
counties
where
the
ballots
were
not
contested,
and
that's
where
i'm
having
some
difficulty,
and
it
goes
back
to,
in
part
to
your
answer
that
you
gave
to
justice
stevens...
justice
scalia
about
broward
county,
and
in
part
to
the
answer
you
are
giving
to
justice
stevens
now.
why
is
it
that
you
say
on
the
one
hand
to
justice
scalia,
oh,
well,
these
weren't
part
of
the
contest,
but
now
all
of
a
sudden
we
are
talking
about
statewide,
not
all
of
which
were
contested,
but
we
are
not
talking
about
the
overvotes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
concern
is
that
the
contest
period
as
we
have
been
talking
about
requires
the
setting
of
standards,
judicial
review,
and
by
reason
of
what
i
take
it
to
be
your
earlier
position
in
the
litigation,
this
period
has
been
truncated
by
19
days,
causing
the
time
frame
of
which
we
are
all
so
conscious,
making
it
difficult
for
appellate
review,
and
it
seems
to
me,
and
we
are
getting
back
to
the
beginning
of
this,
that
the
legislature
could
not
have
done
that
by
a
statute
without
it
being
under
law,
and
that
neither
can
the
supreme
court
without
it
being
a
new
law,
a
new
scheme,
a
new
system
for
recounting
at
this
late
date.
i'm
very
troubled
by
that.
