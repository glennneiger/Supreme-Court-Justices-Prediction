mr.
joseph
p.
klock
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
if
i
could
start
by
addressing
a
question
of
justice
souter
with
respect
to
the
standards,
166
does
have
time
limits.
the
time
limit
of
166
is
set
by
the
certification,
which
is
seven
days
after
the
election.
the
time
of
the
contest,
there
are
time
limits
there
as
well.
you
have
ten
days
to
file
a
complaint,
ten
days
to
file
an
answer,
and
in
the
context
of
a
presidential
election,
you
then
of
course
have
the
december
12
deadline.
so
therefore,
there
are
time--
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
yes,
your
honor,
but
this
court
in
its
opinion
that
it
handed
down
in
the
initial
harris
case
pointed
out
that
it
was
clear
that
there
was
a
desire
in
which
by
the
legislature
to
preserve
the
safe
harbor.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
--they
did
say
that
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
i'll
try
to
answer
that
question.
you
would
start,
i
would
believe,
with
the
requirements
that
the
voter
has
when
they
go
into
the
booth.
that
would
be
a
standard
to
start
with.
the
voter
is
told
in
the
polling
place
and
then
when
they
walk
into
the
booth
that
what
you
are
supposed
to
do
with
respect
to
the
punch
cards
is
put
the
ballot
in,
punch
your
selections,
take
the
ballot
out,
and
make
sure
there
are
no
hanging
pieces
of
paper
attached
to
it.
the
whole
issue
of
what
constitutes
a
legal
vote
which
the
democrats
make
much
ado
about
presumes
that
it's
a
legal
vote
no
matter
what
you
do
with
the
card.
and
presumably,
you
could
take
the
card
out
of
the
polling
place
and
not
stick
it
in
the
box
and
they
would
consider
that
to
be
a
legal
vote.
the
fact
is
that
a
legal
vote
at
the
very
basics
has
to
at
least
be
following
the
instructions
that
you
are
given
and
placing
the
ballot
in
the
box.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
no.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
without
being
disrespectful,
your
honor,
i
think
you
have
answered
the
question
in
terms
of
phrasing
the
question.
there
are
any
number
of
statutory
schemes
that
you
could
select
from
if
you
were
a
legislature,
but
as
a
court,
i
don't
think
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
respectfully,
or
any
other
court
can
sit
down
and
write
the
standards
that
are
going
to
be
applied.
if
you
are
a
legislature....
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
if
i
were
to
take
one
out
of
a
hat,
your
honor,
if
i
was
a
legislature,
what
i
would
do
is
i
would
hold
that
you
have
to
punch
the
chad
through
on
a
ballot.
in
those
situations
where
you
have
a
ballot
where
there
are
only
indentations
in
every
race,
you
might
then
come
up
with
a
different
standard,
but
the
only
problem
that
we
have
here
is
created
by
people
who
did
not
follow
instructions.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
yes.
there
were
no....
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
the
justice's
question
assumes
that
they
are
legal
votes.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
your
honor,
if
they
are
not
properly,
if
the
ballot
is
not
properly
executed,
it's
not
a
legal
vote.
the
only
case
in
florida
that
even
touches
upon
this
in
terms
of
a
machine
ballot
is
the
hogan
case
from
the
fourth
district
court
of
appeal.
in
the
fourth
district
court
of
appeal,
that
candidate
lost
by
three
votes,
and
he
went
during
the
protest
phase
to
the
canvassing
board
and
asked
for
a
manual
recount
to
be
done
and
they
exercised
their
discretion
and
said
no.
and
in
that
case,
there
is
a
discussion.
he
raised
the
argument
that
there
were
ballots
in
there
that
had
hanging
chads
and
this
that
and
the
other
thing.
they
would
hear
none
of
it
and
when
it
went
up
on
appeal,
it
was
affirmed.
so
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
only
case
that
we
have
that
deals
with
this
handles
it
in
that
fashion,
and
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
a
ballot
that
is
not
properly
punched
is
not
a
legal
ballot.
and
i
think
also,
sir,
if
you
go
through
an
analysis
of
the
vice
president's
arguments
in
supporting
what
the
supreme
court
does,
there
is
sort
of
an
omelet
that
is
created
by
going
and
picking
through
different
statutes.
for
instance,
the
clear
intent
standard
comes
from
a
statute
that
deals
with
a
damaged
ballot
where
you
have
to
create,
to
put
through
the
machine,
a
substitute
ballot,
and
there
are
very
clear
directions
as
to
what
to
do
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
ballot.
and
the
beckstrom
case,
which
you
will
no
doubt
hear
much
about
as
the
argument
proceeds,
dealt
with
that
kind
of
situation.
there
was
a
manual
recount
there;
the
court
did
not
pass
on
the
propriety
of
it.
the
issue
was
if
the
election
officials
took
ballots
and
marked
over
the
ballots
instead
of
creating
a
separate
substitute
ballot,
they
took
that
ballot
and
marked
it
over
so
it
could
go
through
an
optical
scanner,
which
the
court
found
to
be
gross
negligence
whether
they
would
discount
the
votes.
that
was
the
issue
that
was
present
there.
so
i
think
if
you
look
through
florida
law
it
is
relatively
clear
that
there
was
no
basis
whatsoever
to
be
able
to
find....
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
i
don't
think
so,
sir.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
well,
justice
brennan,
the
difficulty
is
that
under...
i'm
sorry.
that's
why
they
tell
you
not
to
do
that.
the
standard
that
is
in
166
is
in,
is
dealing
with
the
protest
phase,
and
it
was
brought
about
in
1988.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
the
legislature
would
have
to
create
one,
sir.
i
don't
know
what
standard....
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
what
i'm
saying
is....
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
no.
justice
breyer,
what
i'm
saying
is
that....
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
i
will
now
give
up.
what
i'm
saying,
sir,
is
this.
that
you
cannot
be
in
a
situation
of
using
the
word
interpret
to
explain
anything
that
a
court
does.
the
word
interpret
cannot
carry
that
much
baggage.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
i
think
what
the
florida
supreme
court
should
do
in
that
instance
is
note
the
very
tight
restrictions
that
exist
under
the
protest
phase.
they
require
that
you
find
voter
intent
with
respect
to
a
damaged
ballot.
they
also
vested
in
the
canvassing
board,
and
the
canvassing
board
is
composed
of
a
certain,
a
defined
group
of
officials,
a
county
judge,
the
election
supervisor,
the
chairman
of
the
county
commission,
it
is
very
limited.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
yes,
sir.
i
remember
that.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
it
will
be
hard
to
forget.
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
yes.
justice
scalia,
that
is
correct.
if
you
have
a
situation....
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
joseph
p.
klock
it
is
correct
that
that
statute
provides
that.
that
i
think
that
that
statute,
there
could
be
problems
under
it,
but
that
statute
was
designed
for
a
very
limited
situation
where
there
was
a
problem
with
the
mechanism
of
voting.
it
was
not
designed
to
handle
voter
error
and
that
is
absolutely
clear
because
otherwise,
your
honor,
what
would
occur
is
the
following.
that
in
every
election
that
have
you
that
was
close,
you
would
have
an
automatic
recount
and
then
irrespective
of
what
the
canvassing
board
does,
just
load
all
the
ballots
together
and
put
them
on
a
truck
and
send
them
to
tallahassee
because
if
there
is
no
standard
whatsoever
and
in
any
election
contest
that
you
are
unhappy
with
the
election,
you
can
send
the
ballots
to
tallahassee,
then
have
you
a
problem
that
is
created
that
would
not
exist....
