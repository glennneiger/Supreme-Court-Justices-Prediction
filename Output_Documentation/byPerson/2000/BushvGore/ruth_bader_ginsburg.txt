justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olson,
with
respect
to
the
role
of
judicial
review,
you
rely
very
much
on
the
mcpherson
case,
and
two
things
strike
me
about
that
case.
one
is,
if
you're
right
on
your
jurisdiction
theory,
then
should
not
this
court
have
vacated
instead
of
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
in
that
case
because
the
michigan
legislature
didn't
confer
upon
the
michigan
supreme
court
in
that
case
any
special
authority
of
judicial
review?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
a
decision
by
the
court
reviewing,
which
we
affirmed.
under
your
jurisdiction
theory
as
i
see
it,
there
was
no
role
for
the
michigan
supreme
court
to
play
because
article
ii,
section
1
gives
the
authority
exclusively
to
the
legislature,
and
the
legislature
has
not
provided
for
judicial
review
especially
for
that
measure.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
three
times,
at
least
as
i
counted
in
mcpherson
itself,
it
refers
to
what
is
done
by
the
legislative
power
under
state
constitutions
as
they
exist.
this
is
not
the
most
clearly
written
opinion,
and
yet
three
times,
they
refer
to
the
legislative
power
as
constrained
by
the
state's
constitution.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olson,
you
have
said
the
intent
of
the
voters
simply
won't
do,
it's
too
vague,
it's
too
subjective,
but
at
least,
at
least
those
words,
intent
of
the
voter,
come
from
the
legislature.
wouldn't
anything
added
to
that
be...
wouldn't
you
be
objecting
much
more
fiercely
than
you
are
now
if
something
were
added
to
the
words
that
the
all
powerful
legislature
put
in
the
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
we're
talking
about
the
contest
period,
and
the
statute,
as
justice
souter
pointed
out,
speaks
with
amazing
breadth.
it
says
that
"the
circuit
judge"...
this
is
the
text...
"shall
fashion
any
order
he
or
she
deems
necessary
to
prevent
or
correct
any
wrong
and
to
provide
any
relief
appropriate
under
the
circumstances.
"
i
couldn't
imagine
a
greater
conferral
of
authority
by
the
legislature
to
the
circuit
judge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
there
are
different
ballots
from
county
to
county
too,
mr.
olson,
and
that's
part
of
the
argument
that
i
don't
understand.
there
are
machines,
there's
the
optical
scanning,
and
then
there
are
a
whole
variety
of
ballots.
there
is
the
butterfly
ballot
that
we've
heard
about
and
other
kinds
of
postcard
ballots.
how
can
you
have
one
standard
when
there
are
so
many
varieties
of
ballots?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you
would
have
to
have
several
standards,
county
by
county?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olson,
do
i
understand
that
your
argument
on
the
equal
protection
branch
would
render
academic
what
was
your
main
argument
that's
troublesome,
that
is
that
we
must
say
that
the
florida
supreme
court
was
so
misguided
in
its
application
of
its
own
law
that
we
reject
that,
and
we,
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
decide
what
the
florida
law
is?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
florida
supreme
court
told
us
that
it
hasn't
been
changed
and
just
looking
at
one
of
the
cases
that
you
cite
frequently,
the
o'brien
against
skinner
case,
this
court
said,
well,
maybe
we
would
have
decided
the
new
york
law
differently
but
the
highest
court
of
the
state
has
concluded
otherwise.
it
is
not
our
function
to
construe
a
state
statute
contrary
to
the
construction
given
it
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state.
