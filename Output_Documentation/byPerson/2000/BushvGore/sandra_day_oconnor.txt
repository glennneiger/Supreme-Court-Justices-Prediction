oh,
but
you
think
then
there
is
no
appellate
review
in
the
supreme
court
of
what
a
circuit
court
does?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
it
seemed
apparently
to
just
include
selection
of
electors
in
the
general
election
law
provisions.
it
assumed
that
they
would
all
be
lumped
in
together
somehow.
they
didn't
break
it
out.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
have
the
same
problem
justice
kennedy
does,
apparently,
which
is,
i
would
have
thought
you
could
say
that
article
ii
certainly
creates
a
presumption
that
the
scheme
the
legislature
has
set
out
will
be
followed
even
by
judicial
review
in
election
matters,
and
that
3
u.s.
code
section
5
likewise
suggests
that
it
may
inform
the
reading
of
statutes
crafted
by
the
legislature
so
as
to
avoid
having
the
law
changed
after
the
election.
and
i
would
have
thought
that
that
would
be
sufficient
rather
than
to
raise
an
appropriate
federal
question,
rather
than
to
say
there's
no
judicial
review
here
in
florida.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
would
the
starting
point
be
what
the
secretary
of
state
decreed
for
uniformity?
is
that
the
starting
point....
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--under
the
florida
legislative
scheme?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
standard
did
the
secretary
of
state
set?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
is
it
in
light
of
article
ii?
i'm
not
so
sure.
i
mean,
i
would
have
thought
that
that
bears
on
the
standard,
frankly,
when
it
contemplates
that
it
is
plenary
power
in
the
legislature.
does
that
not
mean
that
a
court
has
to,
in
interpreting
a
legislative
act,
give
special
deference
to
the
legislature's
choices
insofar
as
a
presidential
election
is
concerned?
i
would
think
that
is
a
tenable
view
anyway,
and
especially
in
light
also
of
the
concerns
about
section
5.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
are
responding
as
though
there
were
no
special
burden
to
show
some
deference
to
legislative
choices.
in
this
one
context,
not
when
courts
review
laws
generally
for
general
elections,
but
in
the
context
of
selection
of
presidential
electors,
isn't
there
a
big
red
flag
up
there,
watch
out?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
think
it
did
it
properly?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's,
i
think,
a
concern
that
we
have,
and
i
did
not
find
really
a
response
by
the
florida
supreme
court
to
this
court's
remand
in
the
case
a
week
ago.
it
just
seemed
to
kind
of
bypass
it
and
assume
that
all
those
changes
and
deadlines
were
just
fine
and
they
would
go
ahead
and
adhere
to
them,
and
i
found
that
troublesome.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
thought,
and
maybe
i'm
mistaken,
but
i
thought
it
directed
that
certain
votes
that
had
been
tabulated
after
the
expiration
of
the
original
certification
date
were
to
be
included
now
without
reference
to
the
point
at
all
that
their
opinion
had
been
vacated.
i
just
didn't
know
how
that
worked.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
were
those
dimpled
or
hanging
chads,
so
to
speak?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
with
no
holes
punched?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
was
counted
as
proper
in....
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
palm
beach.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
isn't
the
standard
the
one
that
voters
are
instructed
to
follow,
for
goodness
sakes?
i
mean,
it
couldn't
be
clearer.
i
mean,
why
don't
we
go
to
that
standard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
the
advantage
might
be
as
described
in
the
florida
case,
boardman
v.
esteva,
saying
that
the
certified
election
returns
which
occur
after
the
protest
period
are
presumptively
correct,
and
they
must
be
upheld
unless
clearly
outside
legal
requirements.
i
thought
that
was
florida
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
which
would
make
it
important
to
have
a
protest.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
the
florida
court
has
sort
of
ignored
that
old
boardman
case.
