justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
olson,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
you
rely
on
leser
v.
garnett
and
hawke
v.
smith,
and
is
it
critical
to
your
article
ii
argument
that
we
read
the
word
legislature
as
narrowly,
i
mean
the
power
granted
the
legislature
as
similar
to
that
granted
in
article
v
of
the
constitution,
as
those
cases
dealt
with?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
reliance
on...
you
really
are
not
relying
on
those
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you've
got
to
choose
one
version
of
the
word
legislature
or
the
other....
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
the
choice
of
the
legislature
or
was
it
constitutionally
limited
to
this
provision?
i'm
a
little
unclear
on
what
your
theory
is.
is
it
your
theory,
in
other
words,
that
they
voluntarily
did
not
permit
appellate
review
of
the
lower
courts
in
these
election
contests
or
that
article
ii
prohibited
them
from
allowing
appeal
to
the
appellate...?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
article
v
would
have,
and
under
leser
against
garnett
and
those
cases,
but
you....
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
olson,
isn't
that
one
of
the
issues
in
the
case
as
to
whether
it
was
a
major
revision?
your
opponents
disagree,
and
i
know
you
rely
very
heavily
on
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
florida
supreme
court,
but
which
opinion
do
we
normally
look
to
for
issues
of
state
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
go
ahead.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
olson,
was
the
palm
beach
standard
that
you
referred
in
your
brief
applied
statewide
and
uniformly?
you
refer
to
the
palm
beach
standard
having
changed.
was
the
palm
beach
standard
ever
applied
on
a
statewide
basis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
can
we
possibly
infer
from
the
failure
of
the
secretary
of
state
to
promulgate
a
statewide
standard
that
she
might
have
inferred
that
the
intent
of
the
voter
is
an
adequate
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
olson....
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
olson,
is
it
critical
to
your
position
that
the
florida
supreme
court
erred
in
its
resolution
of
the
shall/may
controversy
in
its
first
opinion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
critical
to
your
position,
because
you're
tying
the
two
cases
together,
that
the
florida
supreme
court
made
that
kind
of
error
in
its
resolution
of
the
conflict
between
shall
and
may
in
the
disparate
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
this
question.
if
you
did
have
a
situation,
i
know
your
position
is
different,
where
there
were
some
uncounted
ballots
due
to
a
machine
malfunction,
for
example,
would
it
not
make
sense
to
assume
that
the
standard
used
for
damaged
ballots
would
be
the
same
standard
you
use
in
that
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
standard
would
you
use
in
the
situation
i
propose,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
my
question
is
if
you
don't
use
that
standard,
what
standard
would
you
use
for
my
hypothetical?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
correct
if
you
use
the
intent
of
the
voter
standard
in
that
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
correct
that
you
use
the
intent
of
the
voter
situation,
standard
in
that
situation?
that's
what
i
understand
the
answer
to
be.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you,
before
you
answer
that
question,
mr.
boies....
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
this
question,
mr.
boies.
is
it
really,
does
not
the
procedure
that
is
in
place
there
contemplates
that
the
uniformity
will
be
achieved
by
having
the
final
results
all
reviewed
by
the
same
judge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
boies,
can
i
ask,
ask
you
this
question.
does
that
mean
there
are
110,000
overvotes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
that's
the
case,
what
is
your
response
to
the
chief
justice
of
florida's
concern
that
the
recount
relates
only
to
undervotes
and
not
overvotes?
