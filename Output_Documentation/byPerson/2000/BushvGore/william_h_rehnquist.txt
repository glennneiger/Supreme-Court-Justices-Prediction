chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
on
number
00-949,
george
w.
bush
and
richard
cheney,
versus
albert
gore,
et
al.
before
we
begin
the
arguments,
the
court
wishes
to
commend
all
of
the
parties
to
this
case
on
their
exemplary
briefing
under
very
trying
circumstances.
we
greatly
appreciate
it.
mr.
olson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
olson.
mr.
klock,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
klock,
will
you...
you
refer
to
the
first
harris
case.
we
think
of
it
as
the
first
bush
v.
gore
case.
you
are
talking
about
the
same....
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
klock.
mr.
boies,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
really...
mr.
boies,
there
are
really
two
parts
to
that
sentence
of
section
5
we're
talking
about.
one
is
the
law
in
effect
at
the
time
and
the
other
is
finally
determined
six
days
before
the
date
for
choosing
the
electors.
do
you
think
the
florida
court
meant
to
acknowledge...
it
seems
to
me
since
it's
cited
generally,
they
must
have
acknowledged
both
of
those
provisions.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that's
the
finally
determined
portion
of
section
5?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
was
a....
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
was
a
trial,
mr.
boies,
in
the
circuit
court
of
miamidade?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
this
the
trial
before
judge
sauls?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
he
ruled
against
the
contestants,
said
they
took
nothing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
factfinding
phase
of
that
trial
would
be
from...
you
say
these
were
found
as
a
fact
in
some...
did
he
make
findings
of
fact?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
did
he
say
with
respect
to
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
opposed
to
just
intent
of
the
voter?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
boies,
one
of
the
dissenting
justices
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
said
that
meant
177,000
ballots.
was
he
correct
in
your
view?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
you
disagree
that
177,000
ballots
will
be
involved
in
this
recount,
how
many
do
you
think
there
are?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
gathered
from
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
that
the
vice
president
did
not
ask
for
as
broad
a
recount
as
the
supreme
court
granted,
but
that
it
thought
that
to
do
just
what
he
wanted
would
be
unfair
and
therefore
out
of
fairness,
they
granted
the
wider
recount,
am
i
correct
in
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
including
appeals
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
and
another
petition
to
this
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
said
after
the
circuit
judge
says
that
the
contest
comes
out
this
way,
surely
there
is
going
to
be
an
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
likely
another
petition
to
this
court.
surely
that
couldn't
have
been
done
by
december
12th,
could
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
a
minute,
mr.
boies.
wouldn't
the
supreme
court
of
florida
want
briefs
and
wouldn't
the
parties
have
needed
time
to
prepare
briefs?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
supreme
court
said
you
had
to
do
it
all
in
the
interest
of
fairness.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
agreed
with
me
on
that
a
moment
ago.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
boies.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
olson,
you
have
five
minutes
13
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
the
case
is
submitted.
