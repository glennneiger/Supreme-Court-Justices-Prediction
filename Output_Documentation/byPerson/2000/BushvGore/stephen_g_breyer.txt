in
respect

that....
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
respect
to
that,
if
it
were
to
start
up
again,
if
it
were
totally
hypothetically,
and
you
were
counting
just
undercounts,
i
understand
that
you
think
that
the
system
that's
set
up
now
is
very
unfair
because
it's
different
standards
in
different
places.
what
in
your
opinion
would
be
a
fair
standard,
on
the
assumption
that
it
starts
up
missing
the
12th
deadline
but
before
the
18th?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
a
uniform
way
of
evaluating.
what
would
the
standard
be,
because
this
is
one
of
your
main
arguments....
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
say
the
intent
of
the
voter
is
not
good
enough.
you
want
substandards.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
in
your
opinion
would
be
the
most
commonly
used
in
the
33
states
or
whatever,
or
in
your
opinion,
the
fairest
uniform
substandard?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
looking
at,
then,
basically
indiana.
is
indiana,
in
your
opinion
or
pre...
or
1990
palm
beach,
are
either
of
those
fair,
or
what
else?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
would
still
like
to
get
your
view
as
to
what
would
be
the
fair
standard.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
still
like
to
get
your
opinion
insofar
as
you
could
give
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
we're
asking,
i
think....
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
what
the
florida
election
law
is
at
this
point
in
your
opinion,
but
rather
if
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
and
i'm
drawing
on
your
experience
as
a
person
familiar
with
elections
across
the
country.
you
have
looked
into
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
would
be
a
fair
subsidiary
standard
applied
uniformly,
were
it
to
be
applied
uniformly
across
all
the
counties
of
florida,
including
broward,
a
fair
uniform
standard
for
undervotes.
remember,
indiana
has
a
statute,
michigan
has
a
statute,
33
states
have
a
statute
where
they
just
say
intent
of
voter,
but
in
your
opinion
because
of
the
hanging
chad,
etcetera,
etcetera,
what
is
a
fair,
not
necessarily
florida
law,
but
a
fair
uniform
standard?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
in
your
opinion,
if
you
were
looking
for
a
basically
fair
standard,
to
take
one
out
of
a
hat,
indiana,
or
palm
beach
1990,
in
your
opinion
would
be
a
basically
fair
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
can
i
ask
you
a
different
question
on
florida
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
question
on
florida
law
is
simply
this,
what
the
statute
is.
i
take
it
the
contest
statute
lists
grounds
for
contesting,
one
of
those
grounds
is
rejecting
a
sufficient
number
of
legal
votes
sufficient
to
place
the
election
in
doubt,
and
then
the
circuit
judge
is
given
the
power
to
investigate
that
allegation,
just
to
look
into
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
would
it
be
illegal
under
florida
law
to
have
a
recount
just
to
investigate
whether
this
allegation
is
or
is
not
so?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
might
be
some
in
there
that
are
legal
under
anybody's
standard.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
by
the
way,
does
it
matter
if
they
said
in
palm
beach
and,
palm
beach
and
miamidade,
the
ones
that
the
court
said
you
must
certify,
if
they
were
thrown
into
the
other,
said
recount
them.
if
it's
uncontested
in
the
trial,
i
guess
that
you
would
get
to
the
same
place.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it
doesn't
really
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
broward
might?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
you
object
if
they
have
a
different
standard
to
recounting
those?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
gave
an
example.
the
example
they
gave
in
their
brief
was
there
is
a
punch
for
governor
bush,
and
then
there
is
a
punch
for
writein
and
the
writein
says
i
want
governor
bush
and
so
i
think
their
implication
is
that
that
would
have
been
rejected
by
the
machine,
but
if
you
looked
at
it
by
hand
the
intent
of
the
voter
would
be
clear.
now
i
don't
know
if
there
are
such
votes,
but
they
say
there
might
be.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
start
with
the
premise,
a
clear
intent
of
a
vote
should
count,
where
there's
a
clear
intent
on
the
ballot,
it
should
count
as
a
vote,
can't
you
reasonably
get
the
majority's
conclusion?
