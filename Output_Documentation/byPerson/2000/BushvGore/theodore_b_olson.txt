mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
just
one
week
ago,
this
court
vacated
the
florida
supreme
court's
november
21
revision
of
florida's
election
code,
which
had
changed
statutory
deadlines,
severely
limited
the
discretion
of
the
state's
chief
election
officer,
changed
the
meaning
of
words
such
as
shall
and
may
into
shall
not
and
may
not,
and
authorized
extensive
standardless
and
unequal
manual
ballot
recounts
in
selected
florida
counties.
just
four
days
later,
without
a
single
reference
to
this
court's
december
4
ruling,
the
florida
supreme
court
issued
a
new,
wholesale
postelection
revision
of
florida's
election
law.
that
decision
not
only
changed
florida
election
law
yet
again,
it
also
explicitly
referred
to,
relied
upon,
and
expanded
its
november
21
judgment
that
this
court
had
made
into
a
nullity.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
federal
question
arises
out
of
the
fact
that
the
florida
supreme
court
was
violating
article
ii,
section
1
of
the
constitution,
and
it
was
conducting
itself
in
violation
of
section
5
of
title
iii
of
federal
law.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
justice
kennedy,
the
constitution
specifically
vested
the
authority
to
determine
the
manner
of
the
appointment
of
the
electors
in
state
legislatures.
legislatures,
of
course
can
use
the
executive
branch
in
the
states,
and
it
may
use
in
its
discretion
the
judicial
branch.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
did
not
do
that
here
because
it
did
not
specify...
it
did
use
the
executive
branch.
in
fact,
it
vested
considerable
authority
in
the
secretary
of
state,
designating
the
secretary
of
state
as
the
chief
elections
official,
and
as
we
point
out,
the
very
first
provision
in
the
election
code
requires
the
secretary
of
state
to
assure
uniformity
and
consistency
in
the
application
and
enforcement
of
the
election
law.
the
secretary
of
state
as
the
executive
branch
is
also
given
considerably
other...
considerable
other
responsibilities,
when
but...
and
to
a
certain
extent,
especially
in
connection
with
the
contest
phase
of
the
election,
certain
authority
was
explicitly
vested
in
the
circuit
court
of
the
state
of
florida,
which
is
the
trial
court.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
certainly
the
legislature
did
not
have
to
provide
appellate
review.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
there
are...
there
is
a
breakout
with
respect
to
various
aspects
of
florida
statute
and
florida
election
law.
there
is
a
specific
grant
of
authority
to
the
circuit
courts.
there
is
no
reference
to
an
appellate
jurisdiction.
it
may
not
be
the
most
powerful
argument
we
bring
to
this
court.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
because
notwithstanding,
notwithstanding...
well,
the
fact
is
that
the
constitution
may
have
been
invoked.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
i
would
say
this
with
respect...
it
would
have
been
a
perfectly
logical,
and
if
you
read
the
statutes,
a
perfectly
logical,
especially
in
the
context
of
a
presidential
election,
to
stop
this
process
at
the
circuit
court,
and
not
provide
layers
of
appeal
because
given
the
time
deadline,
especially
in
the
context
of
this
election,
the
way
it's
played
out,
there
is
not
time
for
an
appellate
court.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
that
i
don't
disagree
with
that
except
to
the
extent
that
i
think
that
the
argument
we
presented
and
amplified
on
in
our
briefs
is
a
good
argument,
it's
a
solid
argument.
it
is
consistent
with
the
way
the
code
is
set
up,
and
it's
particularly
consistent
with
the
timetable
that's
available
in
a
presidential
election.
however....
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
i
think
that
it
is
particularly
in
this
case
where
there's
been
two
wholesale
revisions,
major
restructuring
of
the
florida
election
code,
we
don't
even
get
close
to
that
question
at
all.
it
would
be
unfortunate
to
assume
that
the
legislature
devolved
this
authority
on
its
judiciary
sub
silentio.
there
is
no
specific
reference
to
it.
but
in
this
case,
as
we
have
pointed
out,
especially
the
decision
of
last
friday,
there
was
a
major
overhaul
in
almost
every
conceivable
way.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
i
don't
think
it's
necessary.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
think
those
cases
support
the
argument,
but
as
we
said....
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
in
a
different
context,
it's
not
necessarily
the
case,
and
certainly
it
is
true
that
legislatures
can
employ
the
legislative
process
that
might
include
vetoes
by
a
state
chief
executive,
or
a
referendum,
when
the
state
deliberately
chooses
to
choose
a
legislative
method
to
articulate
a
code.
the
point
i
think
that's
most
important
and
most....
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
article
ii...
we
do
not
contend
that
article
ii
would
prohibit
them
from
fulfilling
that
process.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
in
the
context
of
this
case
we're
saying
that
they
can
include
the
judicial
branch
when
they
wish
to
do
so,
but
under
no
circumstances
is
it
consistent
with
the
concept
of
the
plan
in
the
constitution
for
the
state,
sub
silentio,
the
state
legislature
sub
silentio
to
turn
over
to
the
judiciary
the
power
to
completely
reverse,
revise,
and
change
the
election
code
in
all
of
the
major
respects....
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
entirely
possible
that
that
might
be
the
case,
justice
ginsburg,
but
the
entire
text
of
the
mcpherson
decision
and
its
recitation
of
the
legislative
history
or
the
history
of
legislation
and
acts
by
state
legislatures
to
comply
with
it
make
it
quite
clear
that
the
power
is
vested
in
the
legislature
itself.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
the
context
of
that
case
is
different,
and
that
it's
entirely
possible
for
the
court
to
have
come
to
the
conclusion
it
did
in
that
case
and
we
believe
that
case
is
compelling
for
the
principle
that
we
are
arguing
in
this
case,
that
there
is
no,
the
entire
structure
of
what
florida
did,
its
election
code,
in
its
effort
to
comply
not
only
with
article
ii,
but
with
section
5
of
title
3,
is
such
that
it
did
not
intend
in
any
way
to
divest
itself
of
the
power
to
determine
how
the
appointment
of
electors
would
be
determined
in
a
federal
presidential
election
and
most
importantly,
the
resolution
of
cases
and
controversies,
and
disputes,
with
respect
to
the
appointments....
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
and
i
think
that
that's
important.
i
agree
with
you,
justice
ginsburg.
it's
not
the
most
clearly
written
opinion.
but
i
think
that
in
the
context
of
that
case,
the
relationship
of
the
legislature
to
the
constitution
in
that
case
and
the
way
that
power
was
exercised,
that
ought
to
be
reconciled
with
what
we
are
urging
the
court
today,
that
a
wholesale
revision
and
abandonment
of
the
legislative
authority
can't
be
turned
over,
especially
sub
silentio,
by
a
legislature
simply
because
there
is
a
constitution.
there
is
a
constitution
in
every
state.
there
is
a
judiciary
in
every
state.
the
judiciary
performs
certain
functions
in
every
state,
and
to
go
that
length,
one
would
assume
that
the
judiciary
in
every
state
under
that
argument
could
overturn,
rewrite,
revise,
and
change
the
election
law
in
presidential
elections
notwithstanding
article
ii,
at
will.
now,
this
was
a
major,
major
revision
that
took
place
on
friday.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
think
that
the
dissenting
opinion
and
the
two
dissenting
opinions
are
very
informative.
we
are
relying
on
what
the
court
did.
if
one
looks
at,
for
example,
the
recount
provisions,
before
this
revision
under
florida
law,
manual
recount
under
the
protest
provisions
were
discretionary,
completely
discretionary,
conducted
by
canvassing
boards
during
the
protest
phase
of
the
election,
postelection
period,
pursuant
to
legislatively
defined
procedures
as
to
who
could
be
present,
for
seven
days
after
the
election
with
respect
to
all
ballots
in
a
county,
that
was
mandatory
and
only
available,
as
we
heard
last
week,
for
tabulation
error
up
until
this
election.
after
the
decision
of
december
8th
in
this
context,
those
remand
provisions,
i
mean
those
recount,
manual
recount
provisions
became
mandatory
instead
of
discretionary
pursuant
to
judicial
rather
than
executive
supervsion
during
the
contest
phase
rather
than
the
protest
phase,
even
though
it's
not
even
mentioned
in
the
statute
with
respect
to
the
contest
phase,
pursuant
to
ad
hoc
judicially
established
procedures
rather
than
the
procedures
that
are
articulated
quite
carefully
in
the
statute.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
to
read
that,
to
read
that
provision
and
it's
written
quite
broadly,
but
to
read
that,
one
has
to
read
that
in
the
context
of
the
entire
statutory
framework.
if
one
reads
it
the
way
the
florida
supreme
court
did,
the
entire
process
is
tilted
on
its
head.
where
there
used
to
be
the
decision
that
was
in
the
election
officials,
it
now
becomes
in
the
court.
all
of
the
limitations
on
the
remand
process
that
existed
during
the
protest
phase,
where
the
standards
should
be
lower
because
it's
earlier
in
the
process
are
thrown
out
the
window.
the
time
tables
are
thrown
out
the
window.
the
process
that
exists
are
there
and
one
has
to....
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
there
is
no
timetable.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
but
that's
only
if
you
untether
168
entirely
from
the
statute
and
the
steam
by
which
the
protest
phase
takes
place
over
a
period
of
seven
to
10
days
in
the
context
of
this
election,
and
the
contest
phase
occurs
over
the
next
four
weeks.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
am
hoping
to
convince
you
that
they
passed
far
beyond
the
normal
limits
of
statutory
construction.
the
changing
of
the
meaning....
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
is,
it
is,
we
submit
an
utter
revision
of
the
timetables,
the
allocation.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
we
are
not
just
saying
timetables.
we
are
saying
that
it
has
wrenched
it
completely
out
of
the
election
code
which
the
legislature
very
carefully
crafted
to
fit
together
and
work
in
an
interrelated
fashion.
it
isn't
just
the
timetable.
the
fact
that
there
are
timetables
which
are
very
important
in
a
presidential
election,
we
are
today
smack
up
against
a
very
important
deadline,
and
we
are
in
the
process
where....
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
believe
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
certainly
thought
that
it
was
construing,
it
certainly
said
so
this
time,
that
it
was
construing
the
applicability
of
section
5
and
it
was
expressing
the
hope
that
what
it
was
doing
was
not
risking
or
jeopardizing
the
conclusive
effect....
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
and
we
submit
that
it
incorrectly
interpreted
and
construed
federal
law
in
doing
that
because
what
they
have
inevitably
done
is
provide
a
process
whereby
it
is
virtually
impossible,
if
not
completely
impossible,
and
i
think
it
is
completely
impossible,
to
have
these
issues
resolved
and
the
controversies
resolved
in
time
for
that
federal
statutory
deadline.
furthermore,
it
is
quite
clear,
we
submit,
that
the
process
has
changed.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
because
we
said....
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
because
we
argued,
and
i
believe
that
there
is
a
very
firm
basis
for
saying
that
that
process
already
had
violated
article
ii
of
the
constitution.
it
was
also
already
throwing
in
jeopardy
compliance
with
section
5
of
title
3
because
the
laws
had
been
changed
in
a
number
of
different
respects
and
we
have
recited
them.
the
timetables
are
important.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
and
the
due
process
clause,
and
what
we
know
is
now
the
new
system
that
was
set
forth
and
articulated
last....
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
pardon
me?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
one
fair
standard,
and
i
don't
know
the
complete
answer
to
that,
is
that
there
would
be
a
uniform
way
of
evaluating
the
manner
in
which...
there
was
palm
beach,
for
example....
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
the
standard....
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
we
want....
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
certainly
at
minimum,
justice
breyer,
the
penetration
of
the
ballot
card
would
be
required.
now,
that's
why
i
mentioned
the
palm
beach
standard
that
was
articulated
in
writing
and
provided
along
with
the
ballot
instructions
to
people
voting,
that
the
chad
ought
to
be
punctured.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it's
certainly
a
starting
point,
and
the....
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that
is
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
would
agree
with
that,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
she
had
not
set
one,
and
that's
one
of
the
objections
that
we
had
with
respect
to
the
process
that...
the
selective
process
that
existed
and
that
we
discussed
in
conjunction
with
the
december...
the
november
21st
position.
not
only
was
there
not
a
standard,
but
there
was
a
change
two
or
three
times
during
the
course
of
this
process
with
respect
to
the
standard
that
i
was
just
discussing.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
don't
think
there
is.
there
is
no
limitation
on
when
she
can
answer
advisory
opinions.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
don't...
i
think
that
that's
correct.
now,
whether
or
not
if
there
was
a
change
as
a
result
of
that,
of
the
process,
whether
there
would
be
problems
with
respect
to
section
5
i
haven't
thought
about,
but....
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
it
would
be
feasible.
now,
counsel
for
the
secretary
of
state
will
be
up
in
a
moment,
immediately
after
me.
as
i
understand,
however,
the
election
code,
she
would
have
the
power
to
respond
to
that
inquiry.
in
fact,
under
the
very
first,
as
i
mentioned,
the
very
first
section
of
the
election
code,
sub
1,
she
is
not
only
the
chief
election
officer,
but
has
5
responsibility....
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
certainly
one
that
would...
i
don't...
i
haven't
crafted
it
entirely
out.
that
is
the
job
for
a
legislature.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
part
of
that
standard
is
it
would
have
to
be
applied
uniformly.
it
would
have
to
be...
i
would
think
a
reasonable
standard
is,
would
have
to
be
at
minimum
a
penetration
of
the
chad
in
the
ballot,
because
indentations
are
no
standards
at
all.
there
are
other
procedural
standards
in
the....
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
believe
it
was
not,
justice
stevens.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
i
don't
think
it's
a
fair
inference
either
way.
remember
in
response
to
the
question
from
i
think
it
was
justice
scalia
the
last
time
we
were
here,
this
is
the
first
time
we've
had
a
manual
recount
for
anything
other
than
arithmetic
tabulation
error.
this
is
something
that
is
unprecedented
in
the
state
of
florida.
that's
another
change
that
took
place.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
think
we
have
to
distinguish
between
whether
we're
talking
about
a
prospective
uniform
standard
as
opposed
to
something
that
changes
the
process
in
the
middle
of
the
counting
and
evaluating
of
disputes.
but
it
certainly
would....
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
but
we
submit
in
the
context
of
the
entire
election
code
itself.
now,
the
intent
of
the
voter
standard,
the
one
that's
been
cited
and
relied
upon
by
our
opponents
most,
is
a
provision
that's
contained
in
the
provision
of
the
election
code
that
deals
with
damaged
or
spoiled
ballots.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
violation
of
article
ii
provided
that...
i
mean,
if
the
first
part
of
your
question....
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
if
we
went
from
the
standard
that
existed
before,
the
dimpled
chads,
that
that
had
not
been
a
standard
anywhere
in
florida,
if
that
change
was
made,
we
would
strongly
urge
that
that
would
be
a
violation
of
article
ii.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
would
be
a
complete
change.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
absolutely
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
correct,
they've
been
euphemistically...
this
has
been
euphemistically
referred
to
as
legal
votes
that
haven't
been
counted.
these
are
ballots
where
the
system
created
by
florida,
both
with
respect
to
the
initial
tabulation
and
the
preferred
system
for
the
recount,
the
automatic
recount
in
close
elections,
is
to
submit
those
ballots
to
the
same
mechanical
objective
scrutiny
that
the
initial
count
was
done,
and
those
were
not
counted
either
because
there
were
votes
for
more
than
one
candidate,
which
would
make
them
overvotes,
i
guess
they're
calling
them,
or
that
they
read
as
no
vote,
which
many
people
do,
many
people
do
not
vote
in
the
presidential
election
even
though
they're
voting
for
other
offices.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
that
is
our
contention,
and
that
has
to
be
done.
that
contention
is
based
upon
everything
else
in
the
florida
statute,
including
the
contest
provisions.
the
manual
recount
provisions....
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
because
there
is
no
reference
to
them,
even
though
that
process
is
referred
to....
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
in
the
context,
in
the
context
of
the
statute
as
a
whole,
manual
recounts
are
treated
quite
extensively
as
a
last
resort
for
tabulation
error
at
the
discretion
of
canvassing
officials.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
we
submit...
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i'm
sorry,
i
missed....
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
don't
think
it's
critical.
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
court
expanded
upon
its
previous
decision
that
was
vacated
in
this
case,
it
used
the
time
period
that
it
opened
up
to
do
this
manual
recount
to
then
build
upon
in
the
december
8th
opinion.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
start
with
a
point
or
two
with
respect
to
the
equal
protection
due
process
component
of
this
case.
the
florida
democratic
party
on
november
20
was
asking
the...
november
20th
of
this
year,
was
asking
the
florida
supreme
court
to
establish
uniform
standards
with
respect
to
the
looking
at
and
evaluating
these
ballots,
a
recognition
that
there
were
no
uniform
standards
and
that
there
ought
to
be.
last
tuesday
in
the
11th
circuit,
unless
i
misheard
him,
the
attorney
for
the
attorney
general
of
florida
said
that
the
standards
for
evaluating
these
ballots
are
evolving.
there
is
no
question,
based
upon
this
record,
that
there
are
different
standards
from
county
to
county.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
certainly
the
standard
should
be
that
similarly
situated
voters
and
similarly
situated
ballots
ought
to
be
evaluated
by
comparable
standards.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
you're
certainly
going
to
have
to
look
at
a
ballot
that
you
mark
in
one
way
different
than
these
punch
card
ballots.
our
point
is,
with
respect
to
the
punch
card
ballots,
is
that
there
are
different
standards
for
evaluating
those
ballots
from
county
to
county
and
it
is
a
documented
history
in
this
case
that
there
have
been
different
standards
between
november
7th
and
the
present
with
respect
to
how
those
punch
card
ballots
are
evaluated.
palm
springs
is
the
best
example.
they
started
with
a
clear
rule
which
had
been
articulated
and
explained
to
the
voters,
by
the
way,
as
of
1990.
then
they
got
into
the
process
of
evaluating
these
ballots
and
changed
the
standard
from
moment
to
moment
during
the
first
day
and
again,
they
evolved
from
the
standard
that
the
chad
had
to
be
punched
through
to
the
socalled
dimpled
ballot
standard,
indentations
on
the
ballot.
there
was
a
reason
why
that
was
done.
it
was
because
they
weren't
producing
enough
additional
votes
so
that
there's
pressure
on
to
change
the
standards.
and
that
will
happen
in
a
situation
which
is
where
the
process
is
ultimately
subjective,
completely
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
official,
and
there's
no
requirement
of
any
uniformity.
now,
we
now
have
something
that's
worse
than
that.
we
have
standards
that
are
different
throughout
64
different
counties.
we've
got
only
undercounts
being
considered
where
an
indentation
on
a
ballot
will
now
be
counted
as
a
vote,
but
other
ballots
that
may
have
indentations
aren't
going
to
be
counted
at
all.
the
overvotes
are
in
a
different
category,
and
in
this
very
remedy
the
ballots
in
miamidade
are
being
treated
differently.
some
of
them
have
been
all
examined
and
the
balance
of
the
process,
the
remaining
80
percent
will
be
looked
at
only
in
connection
with
the
undercounts.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i'm
not
sure
i
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
whether
that
would
render
academic
the
challenge.
there
is
a
clear
constitutional
violation,
in
our
opinion,
with
respect
to
article
ii
because
virtually
every
aspect
of
florida's
election
code
has
been
changed
as
a
result
of
these
two
decisions.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
only
thing
i
can
say
in
response
to
that
is
that
what
this
court
said
one
week
ago
today,
that
as
a
general
rule
the
court
defers
to
a
state
court's
interpretation
of
a
state
statute,
but
not
where
the
legislature
is
acting
under
authority
granted
to
it
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
final
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
with
respect
to
section
5.
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
court
in
both
the
earlier
decision
and
the
decision
last
friday
was
aware
and
concerned
about
compliance
with
section
5.
it
construed
section
5
in
a
way
that
allowed
it
by
labeling
what
it
was
doing
as
interpretation
to
change
in
dramatic
respects
the
florida
election
law,
and
we
submit
because
it
did,
so
misconstrued
the
applicability
not
only
with
respect
to
finality
but
the
other
part
of
section
5
requires
a
determination
of
controversies
pursuant
to
a
set
of
laws
that
are
in
place
at
the
time
of
the
elections.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
don't
believe
so
because
we
know
different
standards
were
being
applied
to
get
to
that
point,
and
they
were
having
different
results.
