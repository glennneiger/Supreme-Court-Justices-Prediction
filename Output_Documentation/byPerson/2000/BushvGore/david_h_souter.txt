justice
david
h.
souter
well,
on
ad
hoc
judicially
created
procedures,
the
point
of
subsection
8
of
168.
i
mean,
once
we
get
into
the
contest
phase,
subsection
8
gives
at
least
to
the
circuit
court,
leaving
aside
the
question
of
appellate
jurisdiction,
about
as
broad
a
grant
to
fashion
orders
as
i
can
imagine
going
into
a
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the
timetable
in
168?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right.
there
is
no
timetable
there.
so
that
seems
to
undercut
your
timetable
argument
once
you
get
into
the
contest
phase
from
the
protest
phase.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
may
well
be
and
i'll
grant
you
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
there
would
be
a
sound
interpretive
theory
that
in
effect
would
coordinate
these
two
statutes,
166
and
168,
in
a
way
that
the
florida
supreme
court
has
not
done.
but
that's
a
question
of
florida
supreme
court
statutory
construction
and
unless
you
can
convince
us,
it
seems
to
me,
that
in
construing
168,
which
is
what
we
are
concerned
with
now,
and
its
coordination
or
lack
of
coordination
with
166,
the
florida
supreme
court
has
simply
passed
the
bounds
of
legitimate
statutory
construction,
then
i
don't
see
how
we
can
find
an
article
ii
violation
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
have
convinced
us
certainly
that
there
is
a
disagreement
about
how
it
should
be
construed,
and
that
disagreement
is
articulated
by
the
dissents
in
the
most
recent
case.
but
i
don't
quite
see
where
you
cross
the
line
into
saying
that
this
has
simply
become
a
nonjudicial
act.
it
may
or
may
not
be
good
statutory
construction,
but
i
don't
see
it
as
a
nonjudicial
act.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
mr.
olson,
we're
back
to
the...
there
is
no
timetable
in
166.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
what
your
argument
boils
down
to,
i
think,
is
that
they
have
insufficiently
considered
168,
i'm
sorry,
that
they
have
insufficiently
considered
166
in
construing
168,
and
you
may
be
right,
but
you
have
no
textual
hook
in
168
to
say
untethered
timetables
imply
in
effect
a
nonjudicial
act.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
you
are.
but
that
is
a
deadline
set
by
a
safe
harbor
statute
for
the
guidance
of
congress
and
it's
a
deadline
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
text
in
168.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
took
that
into
consideration
in
fashioning
its
orders
under
subsection
8.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
your
concern
was
with
impossibility,
why
didn't
you
let
the
process
run
instead
of
asking
for
a
stay?
justice
david
h.
souter
we'd
find
out.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
this
were
remanded....
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
sorry.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
this
were
remanded
to
the
leon
county
circuit
court
and
the
judge
of
that
court
addressed
the
secretary
of
state,
who
arguably
either
is
or
could
be
made
a
party,
and
said
please
tell
us
what
the
standard
ought
to
be,
we
will
be
advised
by
your
opinion,
that
would
be
feasible,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
we
have...
there's
no
question
that
the
closest
we
can
come
now
under
florida
law
is
an
intent
of
the
voter
standard.
is
it
your
position
that
if
any
official,
judicial
or
executive,
at
this
point
were
to
purport
to
lay
down
a
statewide
standard
which
went
to
a
lower
level,
a
more
specific
level
than
intent
of
the
voter,
and
said,
for
example,
count
dimpled
chads
or
don't
count
dimpled
chads.
in
your
judgment,
would
that
be
a
violation
of
article
ii?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
so....
justice
david
h.
souter
but
as
to
the
undervotes,
and
as
to
the
undervotes
in
which
there
is
arguably
some
expression
of
intent
on
the
ballot
that
the
machine
didn't
pick
up,
the
majority
of
the
florida
supreme
court
says
you're
wrong.
they
interpreted
the
statute
otherwise.
are
you
saying
here
that
their
interpretation
was
so
far
unreasonable
in
defining
legal
vote
as
not
to
be
a
judicial
act
entitled,
in
effect,
to
the
presumption
of
reasonable
interpretation
under
article
ii?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
it
in
the
contest
provision
that
supports
the
theory
that
that
was
a
rogue,
illegal
judicial
act?
justice
david
h.
souter
there's
no
definition.
doesn't
the
court
have
to
come
up
with
a
definition
of
legal
votes?
justice
david
h.
souter
at
the
protest
stage?
justice
david
h.
souter
which
is
federal,
not
state,
and
occurs
in
the
safe
harbor
statute,
or
as
a
result
of
the
safe
harbor
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
there
is
no....
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
klock,
will
you
address
justice
breyer's
question
of
a
moment
ago,
if
there
were
to
be
a
uniform
standard
laid
down,
i
suppose
at
this
point
by
the
leon
county
circuit
court
or
in
any
other
valid
way
in
your
judgment,
what
should
the
substantive
standard
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
are
saying
that
they
can't
interpret
a
statute
in
which
there
is
no
explicit
definition.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
have
to
throw
their
hands
up?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
justice
souter...
you'd
better
cut
that
out.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
go
to
the
opposite
extreme
and
say,
it
seems
to
me,
that
they
cannot
look,
as
justice
stevens
suggested,
to
a
statute
which
deals
with,
and
certainly
a
closely
analogous
subject
at
a
near
stage,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
in
effect
go
to
the
opposite
extreme
that
you
are
excoriating
the
florida
supreme
court
for
and
say
they
can't
interpret
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
means
the
court
apparently
cannot
define
legal
vote.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they
have
ended
up
with
a
catchall
provision
because
i
assume
there
may
be
cases
in
which
the
general
rule
would
otherwise
operate
in
which
there
is
an
affirmative
counter
indication
to
what
the
general
rule
would
provide,
but
i
think
what's
bothering
justice
kennedy
and
it's
bothering
a
lot
of
us
here
is
we
seem
to
have
a
situation
here
in
which
there
is
a
subcategory
of
ballots
in
which
we
are
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
since
we
know
no
better
that
there
is
no
genuinely
subjective
indication
beyond
what
can
be
viewed
as
either
a
dimple
or
a
hanging
chad,
and
there
is
a
general
rule
being
applied
in
a
given
county
that
an
objective
intent
or
an
intent
on
an
objective
standard
will
be
inferred,
and
that
objective
rule
varies,
we
are
told,
from
county
to
county.
why
shouldn't
there
be
one
objective
rule
for
all
counties
and
if
there
isn't,
why
isn't
it
an
equal
protection
violation?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
but
on
the
assumption
that
there
may
be,
if
we
were
fashioning
a
response
to
the
equal
protection
claim,
and
we
assume
as
a
fact
that
there
may
be
variations,
wouldn't
those
variations
as,
from
county
to
county,
on
objective
standards,
be
an
equal
protection
violation?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
in
jury
to
jury
cases,
we
assume
that
there
is
not
an
overall
objective
standard
that
answers
all
questions
definitively.
we
are
assuming
that
there
is
detail
that
cannot
be
captured
by
an
objective
rule.
the
assumption
of
this
question,
and
i
think,
i
think
it's
behind
what's
bothering
justice
kennedy,
justice
breyer,
me
and
others,
is,
we're
assuming
there's
a
category
in
which
there
just
is
no
other...
there
is
no
subjective
appeal.
all
we
have
are
certain
physical
characteristics.
those
physical
characteristics
we
are
told
are
being
treated
differently
from
county
to
county.
in
that
case,
where
there
is
no
subjective
counter
indication,
isn't
it
a
denial
of
equal
protection
to
allow
that
variation?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
we're
going
to
assume
that
we
do
have
that.
we
can't
send
this
thing
back
for
more
fact
finding.
if,
if
we
respond
to
this
issue
and
we
believe
that
the
issue
is
at
least
sufficiently
raised
to
require
a
response,
we've
got
to
make
the
assumption,
i
think
at
this
stage,
that
there
may
be
such
variation,
and
i
think
we
would
have
a
responsibility
to
tell
the
florida
courts
what
to
do
about
it.
on
that
assumption,
what
would
you
tell
them
to
do
about
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
let's
assume....
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
boies,
let's
assume
that
at
end
of
the
day
the
leon
county,
florida
judge,
gets
a
series
of
counts
from
different
counties,
and
they
heard
those
counties
have
used
different
standards
in
making
their
counts.
at
that
point,
in
your
judgment,
is
it
a
violation
of
the
constitution
for
the
leon
county
judge
to
say,
i
don't
care
that
there
are
different
standards
as
long
as
they
purported
to
fall
on
intent
of
the
voter,
that's
good
enough.
i'll
extend
your
time
by
two
minutes,
mr.
boies.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
the
fact
that
there
is
a
single
judge
at
the
end
of
the
process,
in
your
judgment,
really
is
not
an
answer
to
the
concern
that
we
have
raised.
