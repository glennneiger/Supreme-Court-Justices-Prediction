mr.
jay
w.
stansell
i'm
sorry--
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
mr.
stansell.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i'd
first
like
to
start
by
emphasizing
three
points
to
the
court,
first
that
the
government's
interpretation...
the
government's...
construction
of
the
statute
in
this
case
is
extreme.
it
allows
the
ins
to
lock
somebody
up,
potentially
for
life,
just
simply
because
their
country
of
origin
will
not
take
them
back.
secondly,
our
clients
are
in
no
way
challenging
their
orders
of
deportation,
or
the
government's
plenary
power
to
create
categories
to
deport
them,
and
to
deport
them.
they
are
simply
asserting
their
fifth
amendment
right
to
liberty,
which
they
retain
until
they
are
deported
from
this
country.
and
third,
the
government
has
other
alternatives
in
this
case,
in
these
cases.
they
are
not
left
unprotected.
the
ins
retains
a
substantial
statutory
and
regulatory
authority
to
supervise
mr.
ma
and
mr.
zadvydas
and
those
similarly
situated.
in
stark
contrast
to
the
government's
statutory
construction,
the
circuit
court
suggested
a
reasonable
construction
of
this
statute
that
allows
for
the
detention
beyond
the
removal
period
for
a
reasonable
time
period.
this
interpretation,
this
construction
is
consistent
with
the
silence
of
the
statute,
which,
as
explained
by
the
circuit
court,
invites
the
question
of
what
time
period
are
we
talking
about.
the
government
would
seek
a
time
period
of
"indefinitely",
that
word
to
be
read
into
the
statute.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
what
congress
has
not
done
is
specify
how
long
beyond
the...
how
long,
following
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
they
would
intend
to
detain.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
i
think
the
court's...
or
the
circuit
court's
construction
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
historical
treatment.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
i'm--
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
--i'm
sorry,
i'm
talking
about
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
i'm
referring
specifically
to
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
dealing
purely
with
the
statutory
construction
issue
and
putting
a
reasonable
construction
on
the
statute
that
avoids
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
chevron
deference
simply
doesn't
apply
when
you're
applying
the
constitutional
avoidance
doctrine,
because
i
believe
that
agencies
are
not...
while
they
may
have
expertise
at
interpreting
their
own
statute,
they
don't
necessarily
have
expertise
in
interpreting
the
constitution,
and
even
most
recently
this
past
term
this
court
in
solid
waste
agency
of
northern
cook
county
did
not
grant
chevron
deference
when
there
was
a
constitutional
problem
indicated.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
well,
your
honor,
the
circuit
court
did
not
specifically
define
what
is
a
reasonable
time
period.
i
think
our
position
would
be--
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
--your
honor,
our
position
would
be
if
it's
not
reasonably
perceivable,
if
deportation
is
not
perceivable,
there's
not
some
objective
fact
that
they
can
point
to
that
this
individual
is
going
to
be
deported,
then
holding
that
person
beyond
that
period
would
not
be
a
reasonable
time.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
that's
what
we
do
with
any
other
person,
and
that's
the
appropriate
term
here,
any
other
person
who
has
finished
their
prison
time
and--
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
--well,
your
honor,
the
first
part
of
your
hypothetical
i
think
is
essentially
what
the
law
is.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
your
honor,
i--
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
--your
honor,
i
think
because
the
constitution
has
the
paramount...
is
the
paramount
authority
under
which
all
statutes
have
to
be
gauged,
i
think
that
the
last
portion
of
your
hypothetical
would
be
unconstitutional.
everyone
retains
the
right
to
liberty
once
they've
entered
our
shores,
once
they
pass
through
our
gates.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
mr.
chief
justice,
the...
i
think
you're
referring
to
the
mezei
decision
and--
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
--the
mezei
decision
is
a
unique
and
very
distinguishable
case
on
its
facts.
it
involved
an
individual
coming
to
the
border,
seeking
entry,
not
bringing
any
constitutional
rights,
and
it
involved
an
individual
who
was
also
ordered
excluded
on
public
safety
or
national
security
grounds,
and
it
also
came
at
a
time
prior
to
the
court's
development
of
its
jurisprudence
on
some
sort
of
due
process
in
the
civil
detention
scheme.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
that--
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
--mr.
chief
justice,
that's
entirely
correct,
but
what's
important
is
that
on
the
other
hand
mezei
never
questioned
the
general
rule
that
it
was
setting
out
the
narrow
delineated
exception
for--
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
--and
that
general
rule
is
that
once
an
alien
has
passed
through
our
gates,
and
it
is
more
or
less
a
direct
quote,
has
passed
through
our
gates,
even
illegally,
they're
entitled
to
the
protections
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
yes,
i
am,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
he's
protected...
certainly
protected
as
to
his
liberty
interests,
his
interest
in
being
free
from
bodily
restraint
is
protected
coequal
with--
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
--mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
a
distinct
form
of
detention
that's
separate
from
what...
the
indefinite
post
final
order
detention
that
we
are
talking
about.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think,
you
know,
i
perhaps
misspoke,
that,
of
course,
the
government
has
countervailing
interests
that
they
can
detain
any
individual
for
a
number
of
reasons.
it's
been
recognized
by
this
court
that
detention
pending
deportation
proceedings
is
one
of
those
circumstances,
and
this
court's
decision
in
carlson
supports
that.
what
this
court
has
never
done
is
taken
this
a
step
further
and
essentially
condoned
what
could
be
lifetime
detention
for
individuals
who
have
in
hand
their
full
fifth
amendment
protections,
and
i
would
want
to
emphasize
that
mr.
ma
and
mr.
zadvydas
today
are
substantially
constrained.
their
liberty
interests
are
not
the
same
currently.
they're
both
out
in
the
world.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
that's
exactly
correct.
there
are
broad
statutory
and
regulatory
provisions
that
ins
can
impose
on
them
in
terms
of
travel
restrictions,
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
they're
going
to
be
allowed
to
work,
in
terms
of
having
to
submit
to
psychiatric
and
medical
evaluations
and
just,
you
know...
and
just
contact
with
the
ins.
they
could
be
required
to
report
every
day
to
the
ins.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
your
honor,
i
believe
the
judicial
review...
there's
nothing
inherent
in
the
regulations
themselves
that
allow
for
judicial
review.
i
think
if
there
were--
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
--that's
correct.
that's
my
understanding
of
the
regulations.
i
think
if
somebody
were--
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
--that's
correct.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
2241
is
the
jurisdiction
here.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
well,
your
honor,
it...
the
hypothetical
you
lay
out
would
allow
somebody
through
the
administrative
action
of
an
administrative
agency
to
be
put
in...
to
be
incarcerated
for
life,
and
this
court
has
never
condoned
such
an
extreme
civil
detention
process.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
that
would
be
a
different
case,
your
honor,
and
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
--what
the
constitutional
rule
would
be.
what's
at
issue
here
is
whether
the
detention
is
excessive
in
relationship
to
the
legitimate
government
interest,
and
the
legitimate
government
interest--
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
--if
it
was
with
a
judge
and
a
jury
and
the
right
to
indictment
and
the
grand
jury--
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
--i'm
not
sure
what
i
would...
how
i'd
answer
that,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
well,
you
know,
i
think
it
raises
a
number
of
different
issues,
but
what's
at
the
heart
of
this
is
the
fact
that
mr.
ma
and
mr.
zadvydas,
when
they
entered
the
country,
they
were
cloaked
with
the
constitution,
and
this
court
has
delineated
a
very
narrow
exception
in
mezei,
an
exception
that
recognized
the
general
rule
set
out
in
wong
wing
in
1896
that
has
stood...
that
withstood,
has
withstood
this
test
of
time
and
has
been
cited
by
this
court
in
modern
cases.
that
general
rule
remains,
and
all
they
are
asking
for
in
this
case,
and
the
substantive
due
process
claim
here,
is
simply
to
ask
ins
to
take
into
consideration
the
fundamental
aspect
that
is
really
driving
these
cases,
the
fact
that
people
are
locked
up
for
life.
if
they
considered
that
and
weighed
that
and
balanced
that
against
the
other
interests,
then
it
would
be...
it
would
pass--
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
your
honor,
i
was
speaking
to
the
constitutional
test
that
we
think
is
driven
by
this
court's
civil
detention
cases.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
your
honor,
if
somebody
came
into
this
country
and
they
were
told
that
if
you
commit
an
offense
as
an
alien
you'll
be
sentenced
to
potentially
for
life...
and
currently
i
think
the
government
does
have
the
power
to
allow,
or
to
move
people
out
of
the
country,
deport
them
prior
to
the
completion
of
their
sentence.
if
it
were
a
criminal--
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
--your
honor,
if
it's
just
a
straight
imposition
of
a
life
sentence,
i
think
that
would
implicate--
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i'm
missing
the
connection.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure.
it
strikes
me
that
that
raises
other
issues
that
aren't
raised
in
this
case,
and
all
we
are
saying
in
this
case
is
that
where
no
consideration
is
given
to
the
foreseeability
of
deportation,
and
it's
not
a
criminal
charge
and
a
criminal
sentence
that
any
of
these
people
are
serving,
it's
unconstitutional,
and
that's
what's
informing--
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
--i
think
that
might
be.
i
think
there
might
be
an
equal
protection
issue
that's
raised,
and
quite
frankly
i
hadn't
thought
about
that
question.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
the
surveys
that
the
government
relies
upon
had
a
much
broader
sweep
to
them.
i
don't
think
these
individuals
that
we've
represented,
who
are
in
custody
by
ins,
seeming
like
they're
in
custody
for
life,
and
they
get
a
district
court
order
to
release,
are
doing
quite
well,
by
and
large,
because
they
think
that
their
next
mishap
will
put
them
in
custody
for
life.
there's
no
indication
that
mr.
zadvydas
or
mr.
ma
at
this
point
are
doing
anything
other
than
staying
in
touch
and
responding,
complying
with
all
of
the
conditions
of
their
supervision.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
that's
correct.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
he
was
7
years
old
when
he
entered
the
country,
and
he's
lived
here
his
entire
life.
he's
23
years
old
now.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
that's
correct.
if
we
were...
dealing
with
the
hypothetical
we've
been
talking
about,
your
honor?
yes.
you
know,
all
of
these
people
are
on
notice
that
they
need
to
comply
with
the
immigration
laws,
and
they
have
no
doubt,
and
they
are
not
challenging
in
any
way
the
government's
power
to
deport
them,
or
the
circumstances
under
which
they
can
be
deported.
what
they
are
just
asking
for
is
their
right
to
be
free
from
bodily
restraint
pending
that
deportation.
may
it
please
the
court,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
jay
w.
stansell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i
have
just
four
points
i
would
like
to
make.
the
first
is
that
the
administrative
process
in
this
case.
what
's
fundamentally
wrong
about
it,
it
takes
absolutely
no
consideration
that
deportation
is
not
foreseeable.
if
it
did,
and
if
the
agency
weighed
foreseeability
with
actual
and
real
evidence
of
dangerousness
and
flight
risk,
we
would
have
no
quarrel
with
the
agency
applying
that
constitutional
test
in
reviewing
these
individuals.
secondly,
as
i
just
said,
the
test
in
any
case
has
to
be,
is
detention
excessive
in
relationship
to
the
legitimate
government's
interest,
and
we
feel
like
the
district
court
in
mr.
ma's
case
had
the
proper
test,
balancing
foreseeability
of
deportation
with
dangerousness,
real
evidence
of
dangerousness
and
flight
risk.
we
would
draw
the
line
at,
is
deportation
foreseeable,
and
say
on
balance
everyone
would
get
out
on
this
case.
this
court
may
disagree,
and
want
to
allow
a
broader
balancing
test
where
actual
foreseeability
might
be
a
gradiated
scale
and
allow
for
different
balances
to
be
drawn,
but
in
any
case,
that's
the
test
that
should
be
applied.
third,
that
there's
no
authority
for
this
court
to
expand
mezei.
the
decision
in
wong
wing
is
over
100
years,
and
that
stands
as
a
general
rule
that
informs
the
mezei
narrow
exception.
witkovich
is
similarly
situated.
individuals
who've
been
ordered
deported
did
not
lose
their
constitutional
rights.
