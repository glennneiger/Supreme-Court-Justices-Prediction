mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
congress
in
the
exercise
of
its
plenary
authority
over
immigration
enacted
section
1231(a)(6)
in
196...
1996
to
afford
the
attorney
general
the
authority
to
detain
dangerous
criminal
aliens
beyond
the
90
day
removal
period
if
they
cannot
be
removed
to
their
countries
of
nationality
or
to
some
other
country
during
that
90
day
period.
that
enactment
was
the
culmination
of
measures
beginning
in
1988
by
which
congress
sought
to
address
what
had
become
the
serious
problem
of
criminal
aliens
within
the
united
states.
it
was
enacted
against
a
background
of
information
in
1996
in
particular,
about
both
the
high
rate
of
recidivism
among
criminal
aliens
as
well
as
the
very
high
rate
of
flight
among
aliens
who
are
released.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
does
not,
no,
but
what
i...
the
important
element,
though,
is
that
future
dangerousness
is
a
legitimate
basis
on
which
to
detain
someone.
under
this
court's
civil
commitment
cases,
and
this
does
not
remotely
resemble
civil
commitment
because
it's
an
exercise
of
congress'
plenary
power
over
immigration,
but
one
of
the
bases
on
which
someone
may
be
civilly
committed
is
their
potential
dangerousness.
now,
the
court--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
that's--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
it
is
in
this
important
respect,
and
i
think
this
is
a
critical
factor
to
understanding
this
case.
what
the
court
said
in
hendricks,
for
example,
is
that
in
the
civil
commitment
cases
the
court
has
said
it's
dangerousness
plus
some
other
factor,
such
as
mental
illness.
here
we
have
a
critical
other
factor,
in
addition
to
dangerousness,
and
that
is
that
both
mr.
ma
and
mr.
zadvydas
in
this
case
had
had
their
right
to
remain
in
this
country
extinguished.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
pardon
me?
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
in
our
submission
the
detention
of
the
aliens
is
reasonably
related
to
the
basis
for
detention,
as
long
as
there
is
a
basis
for
concern
about
threat
to
the
community
and
removal.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
is
not
clear
now.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that,
and
in
addition,
because
of
the
potential
for
dangerousness
to
the
community.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i'd
like
to
answer
that
in
two
respects.
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
reasonable
time
limitation
within
the
statute.
on
the
other
hand,
it
depends
what
you
mean,
what
could
be
comprehended
within
the
determination
of
reasonableness.
i
mean,
for
example--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
in
this
case
the
attorney--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
attorney
general
has
implemented
this
statute
in
a
way...
maybe
the
attorney
general
had
broader
authority
to
detain
someone
permanently
without
ever
releasing
someone,
but
the
constitutional
question
before
the
court,
and
the
statutory
question
for
that
matter,
has
to
be
analyzed
in
terms
of
what
the
attorney
general
did
in
the
exercise
of
his
discretion
in
establishing
a
review
procedure
under
which
the
alien
is
subject
to
periodic
review
to
determine
whether
he
is
either
dangerous
or
a
risk
of
flight.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
do
not
agree
with
it
in
this
respect.
we
do
not
believe
it
is
for
the
courts
to
determine
whether,
at
least
in
the
first
instance
and
without
a
high
degree
of
deference
to
the
attorney
general
as
to
whether
there
is
another
country
to
whom
the
alien
might
conceivably
be
returned
in
the
future.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
i'm
not.
i
"m
not".
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
our
position,
but
i
would
like
to
say
something
about
the
two
aliens
in
this
case,
just
to
show
that
we're
not
even
near
that
position.
contrary
to
mr.
zadvydas's
counsel's
position
that
nothing
has
been
done
with
respect
to
him
recently,
we
point
out
at
page
48,
footnote
22
of
our
brief,
facts
have
happened
after
the
letter
that
he
referred
to
that
mr.
zadvydas
wrote
to
the
lithuanian
consulate.
as
we
point
out
in
that
brief,
the
ins
twice
last
summer
called
mr.
zadvydas
in
for
an
appointment,
after
he
asked
that
that
appointment
be
postponed,
so
it
could
be
explained
to
him
what
information
the
ins
had
obtained
from
the
lithuanian
consulate
as
to
what
information
would
be
necessary
to
apply
to
lithuania
for
citizenship
based
on
the
lithuanian
citizenship
of
his
parents.
on
both
instances,
he
did
not
show
up
for
the
appointment,
so
he
is
not
cooperating
with
the
known
procedures
for
submission
of
documents
that
lithuania
has
identified
as
germane
to
the
question
of
whether
he
would
be
granted
citizenship.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
is,
but
the
important
purpose
of
the
detention
here
is
to
protect
the
community
as
a
prophylactic
matter,
not
simply
to
take
measures
against
someone
after
the
fact.
now,
having
said
that,
under
the
regulations
that
i've
described,
even
before
the
formal
regulations
went
in
place
in
december,
up
to
50
percent
of
the
people
who
were
reviewed
under
the
interim
procedures
that
were
in
place
were
released
during
that
period
of
time,
so
these
regulations
do
afford
a
periodic
opportunity--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i'm
not...
well,
all
of
them,
or
almost
all
of
them
in
the
sense
that
they
were
convicted
of
a
crime.
most
of
the
people
detained
in
this
category
have
a
criminal
history,
maybe
a
few
who
do
not,
but
the
two
aliens
before
the
court
right
now
were
convicted
of
a
crime
in
which
they
had
all
of
the
procedures
to
which
they
were
entitled
in
determining
that,
and
this
court
has
said--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--they
have,
but
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
jones
case,
which
was
discussed
in
foucha,
it
is
permissible
for
a
state
to
presume
continuing
dangerousness
from
the
conviction
of
a
crime,
and
the
fact
that
someone
has
served
a
criminal
sentence
does
not
remove
the
inference
of
continuing
dangerousness.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
oh,
i
think
there
are
several.
i
think
the
mezei
case
does.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
it
is
our
submission
that
once
an
alien
has
been
ordered
removed
from
the
country,
as
both
of
the
aliens
here
have
been...
not
only
have
they
had
a
criminal
conviction,
with
all
the
protection
that
affords,
but
they
have...
are
subject
to
final
orders
of
removal
under
an
administrative
process
in
which
that
had
be
proven
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
the
procedures
are
unquestioned
in
this
case.
the
consequence
of
the
final
order
of
removal--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there's
not,
and
if
i
may
explain
why,
there
is
no
difference
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
status
or
the
interests
of
the
alien,
there
is
no
difference
with
respect
to
the
sovereign
powers
of
the
united
states,
and
there
is
no
difference--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i'm
speaking
of
the
legal
status
of
the
alien,
and
the
third
is
with
respect
to
the
interests
of
the
united
states.
with
respect
to
the
status
of
the
alien,
it's
important
to
consider
the
consequences
of
a
final
order
of
removal.
it
is
not
simply
an
order
of
removal.
it
also
terminates
the
person's
status
as
a
lawful,
permanent
resident.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
i
may,
this
does
not
rest
on
a
legal
fiction.
the
first
thing
i
would
like
to
point
out
is,
just
to
finish
the...
because
this
is
important
to
answering
the
question...
to
finish
the
consequences
of
a
final
order
of
removal,
the
first
thing
it
does,
as
i
mentioned,
is,
it
terminates
the
status
of
an
alien
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--which
is
defined
as
a
privilege
of
being
lawfully
admitted,
such
status
not
having
changed,
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
but
then
the
further
consequence
is,
under
1182(a)(9)
of
the
act,
the
alien
is
inadmissible
for
10
years,
or,
in
the
case
of
an
aggravated
felon
like
these,
for
20
years,
so
that--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--so
that
person
is--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
what
i...
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is,
in
terms
of
his
legal
status
he
is
in
exactly
the
same
legal
status
under
the
laws
congress
has
passed
to
protect
this
nation
as
someone
who
is
at
the
border,
someone
who
has
no
rights--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
it
does
not,
but
the
important
thing
about...
the
important
thing
to
consider
if
you
look
at
someone
like
mezei,
who
was
here
for
25
years,
and
went
abroad
for
i
think
19
months
before
he
came
back
in,
the
court
said
that
he
was
an
arriving
alien,
even
though
he
had
a
long
time
in
this
country,
but
the
important
point
is
that
mezei
was
about
procedure,
and
what
the
court
was
relying
on
in
the
so
called
entry
fiction
there
was
the
fact
that
it
was
the
court
sustained
the
authority
of
the
attorney
general
to
keep
him
excluded
on
the
basis
of
classified
evidence
that
was
never
shown
to
the
alien.
even
justice
jackson
in
his
dissent
in
mezei
rejected
the
notion
that
there
was
a
substantive
due
process
problem
with
detaining
mezei--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
here--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no...
and
the
other
part
of
mezei,
that
was
the
part
of
mezei
that
depended
on
the
entry
fiction,
but
the
other
part
of
mezei
is,
he
had
no
liberty
interest
to
be
at
large
in
the
united
states,
and
our
point
is
that
that
liberty
interest
to
be
at
large
in
the
united
states
was
extinguished
by
the
final
order
of
removal.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
absolutely.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
absolutely--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--not
at
all.
i--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
was
exactly
the
point
i
was
going
to
make.
one
could
make
the
same
point
here
with
respect
to
the
removal
of
an
alien
who
was
previously
here,
and
whose
right
to
remain
here
has
been
extinguished.
the
united
states
would
not
do
this,
but
one
way
to
remove
the
alien
from
the
united
states
would
be
to
put
him
on
a
boat,
or
to
insist
that
he
find
a
county
and,
unless
he
finds
a
country
he
will
be
detained
here.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
there's
not
a
precedent,
put
this...
put
that
way,
but
if
i
may
respond,
the
basis
for
the
removal
order
in
this
case
were
criminal
convictions,
in
which
the
aliens'
criminal
trials--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
but
you
said
where
the
basis
for
the
detention
is
not
preceded
by
any
criminal
trial.
here,
there
was
a
criminal
trial.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
with
all
respect,
the
criminal
conviction
in
this
case,
in
both
of
these
cases
and
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
in
which
people
are
being
detained,
plays
a
critical
role
in
their
continued
detention.
this
was
something
that
the
court
found
to
be
a
permissible
factor
in
both
foucha
and
in...
and
particularly
in
jones,
where
the
court
said
that
there
could
be
a
presumption
of
continuing
dangerousness
subject
to
rebuttal
by
the
individual,
which
is
exactly
what
we
have
here.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
okay.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
okay.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
several.
the
first
is
fong
yue
ting,
which
says--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--fong,
f
o
n
g,
yue,
i
think
it
is,
y
u
e,
ting,
t
i
n
g,
which
says
that
congress'
power
over...
power
to
expel
aliens,
in
other
words
to
deport
them,
is
the
same
and
is
as
absolute
as
congress'
power
to
exclude
aliens,
and
we've
set
out
the
relevant
quote
in
our
brief
in
the
zadvydas
case,
which
i
believe
is
at
pages
37
and
38.
so
i
think
that
is
an
important
constitutional
basis
for
the
point
i
was
making
earlier,
that
once
someone's
right
to
remain
here
is
extinguished,
and
he's
put
back
in
that
status,
it
is
proper
to
equate
them
to
mezei.
the
next
line
of
cases
that
i
would
point
to
are
cases,
in
particular,
that...
civil
commitment
cases,
where
the
court
has,
i
think,
contemplated
that
there
could
be
subsequent
determinations
following
on
a
presumption
coming
out
of
a
criminal
conviction
of
continuing
dangerousness.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
but
it
seems
to
me
another
important
point
that
the
court
has
said
with
respect
to
aliens,
and
this,
i
can't
remember
the
case
in
particular,
but
the
court
has
said
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
congress
can
commit
the
determination
of
immigration
matters
to
the
executive
branch,
and
have
determinations
made--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
but
with
respect
to
its
fundamental
point
that
the
congress--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--precisely.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
exactly--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
is--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
and
the
point
is
that
1231(a)(6),
enacted
pursuant
to
congress'
plenary
power,
vests
the
release
authority
in
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general,
and
so
it
would
be
odd
in
that--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
is
habeas
corpus
review.
we
do
not
challenge
the
right
of
an
alien
who
is
held
subject
to
the
attorney
general's
authority
under
the
statute
to
seek
habeas
corpus
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
detention,
so
if
there
is
an
argument--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
if
there
is
constitutional
review
of
the
individualized
determination,
it
would
only
be
along
the
lines
of
what
the
supreme...
of
what
this
court
said
in
carlson
and
reiterated
in
flores,
which
would
be
whether
the
attorney
general's
determination
was
arbitrary.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
correct.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
and
those--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
is
right,
so...
and
the
important
point
is
for
these
purposes--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we're
certainly
not
saying
there
is
no
access
to
habeas
corpus,
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
detention.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
you
are
correct
the
alien
will,
under
our
submission,
lose
at
least,
or
in
the
exceptional
case,
in
that
circumstance,
but
that's
because
congress
has
vested
in
the
attorney
general
the
delicate
question
of
deciding
when
an
alien
should
be
released
and
not.
this...
in
this
area,
like
in
so
many
areas
of
immigration,
this
is
intimately
tied
up
with
foreign
relations.
as
we
point
in
our
briefs,
with
respect
to
mr.
ma,
for
example,
we
are
engaged
in
negotiations
with
southeast
asian
countries--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
believe
there
is
not,
that
under
1252(a)(2)(b)(ii)
of
title
viii
it
bars
judicial
review
of
anything,
any
determinations
that
are
committed
to
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
administrative
process
is
good
enough,
and
the
first
and
basic
point
is
the
one
that
justice
scalia
said,
which
is
that
the
most
important
ingredient
of
liberty
interests
at
stake
here
was
extinguished,
the
right
to
be
at
large
in
the
united
states
was
extinguished
in
the
administrative
deportation
proceeding--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--subject
to
judicial
review
if
the
alien
chose
it,
and
the
aliens
in
this
case
did
not
seek
to
challenge
the
extinguishment
of
their
liberty
interests.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
take
it
to
be
that
there's
no
liberty
interest,
is
my--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
that
i
think
cannot--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that,
i
think,
cannot
be
correct,
at
least
if
one
looks
at
wong
wing,
which
prohibited
the
service...
imprisonment
and
hard
labor
for
someone
who
was
in
the
united
states.
it
is
no
part
of
our
submission
that
an
alien
who
is
illegally
present,
or
who
has
been
paroled
into
the
united
states
in
a
case
like
mezei,
is
not
a
person
for
purposes
of
protection
independent
of
the
immigration
laws,
but
it's
quite
a
different
matter
to
say
that
the
due
process
clause
was
somehow
intended
to
limit
congress'
plenary
power
to
protect
the
united
states,
and
the
safety
of
the
united
states.
one
other
point
that
i'd
like
to
make,
because
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind,
protecting
the
safety
of
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
the
community
is
not
ancillary
to,
or
simply
incidental
to
an
immigration
consequence.
it
is
part
of
the
whole
point
of
removal
of
the
aliens
in
this
situation,
that
they
were,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
essentially
in
this
country
conditioned
upon
their
compliance
with
our
laws.
they
broke
our
laws,
they
committed
crimes,
and
they...
and
committed
crimes
that
demonstrate
that
they
present
a
danger
to
the
community.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it
is
very
likely
to
factor
in
to
another
country's
calculus
of
how
willing
they
will
be
to
take
someone
back
whether
that
person
is
in
custody
or
not,
because...
the
court
pointed
out
in
mezei
that
congress
could
reasonably
conclude
that
when
an
alien
such
as
mezei
arrives
at
our
borders,
that
person
is
no
more
our
problem
than
the
other
country's.
with
respect
to
an
alien
and
his
own
country
of
nationality,
his
liberty
is
that
country's
responsibility,
not
ours,
rather
than
ours.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
goes
beyond
the
excludable
class,
because
if
a
foreign
dictator
realized
that
he
could
cause
the
release
into
this
country
at
large
of
nationals
of
that
country
simply
by
refusing
to
take
people
back--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
that
status
has
been
extinguished,
and
they
have
no
right
to
remain
here,
and
they
do
have
a
right
under
international
law
to--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--maybe
not
dumping
in
the
first
instance,
but
what
the
refusal
to
take
someone
back...
and
we...
for
example,
with
respect
to
cuba
we
have
a
number
of
people
who
have
come
to
cuba
and
are
here
lawfully
who
we
want
to
remove
from
our
midst,
not
simply
those
who
were
foisted
upon
us
under
the
mariel
boat
lift,
and
if
we
have
a
foreign
dictator--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it's
we
don't
want
them
any
more,
and
it
is
your
responsibility
to
take
him
back,
and
the
pressures
on
that
other
country,
not
simply
from
the
united
states
government
but
from
the
alien
himself,
from
human
rights
groups,
from
his
family,
are
much
greater
for
that
other
country
to
take
him
back
when
he's
in
detention.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
is
correct,
as
we've
seen--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
is
correct,
as
we're
seeing--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--pardon
me?
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it
depends
on...
a
lot
of
the
aliens
here
are
not
released.
i
mean,
they
had
previously
to
report--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
attorney
general...
first
of
all,
questions
such
as
this
we
think
are
committed
to
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
attorney
general
in
issuing
the
final
regulations
in
december
pointed
out
that
ins
had
commissioned
a
study
of
other
methods
for
supervision
of
aliens
who
might
safely
be
released
to
see
if
there's
some
middle
ground,
halfway
houses
and
things
like
that,
and
the
notice
points
out
that
the
ins
is
going
to
be
expanding
that
program
to
see
whether
there
are
alternatives,
but--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
the
aliens
in
this
case
are
certainly
not
seeking
house
arrest.
they
are
seeking
being
released
under
some
degree
of
supervision,
but
they
are--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
we
certainly
think
it
would
give
the
attorney
general
the
authority
to
insist
that
the
person
be
released
into
a
program,
a
halfway
house
or
a
drug
treatment
program,
and
that
also
is
pointed
out
in
the
preamble
to
the
new
regulations,
but
we
don't
believe--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
could
be,
but
the
questions
of
exactly
what
form
of
custody
to
keep
an
alien
in,
are
mixed
up
with
the
broader
responsibilities
of
the
attorney
general
under
laws
passed
by
congress
to
administer
the
immigration
laws
in
terms
of
what
facilities
someone
should
be
kept
in
while
they're
being
detained.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
i'm
not
sure
of
all
of
them,
but
there
are
periodic
reporting
requirements
and
not
leaving
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
what
the
attorney
general
has
concluded
is,
for
people
who
do
not
pose
a
threat
to
the
community...
reporting
requirements
are
not
going
to
stop
someone
from
being
a
threat
to
the
community.
they
may
guard
against
flight,
but
they
are
a
far
more
inadequate
protection
against
danger
to
the
community.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
but
the
important...
the
balance
of
interest
is
completely
different
with
respect
to
a
citizen
and
an
alien
who
not
only--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--because
under
salerno,
for
example,
the
court
said
that
an
individual's
interest
in
liberty
can
be
outweighed
by
important
governmental
interests.
there
is
a
compelling
interest
in
protecting
the
safety
of
the
community,
but
where
the
liberty
interest
that
is
going
to
be--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
the
countervailing
liberty
interest
is
far,
far
less,
to
the
extent
the
alien
has
any
remaining
liberty
interest,
because
his
right
to
be
at
large
in
the
united
states
has
been
extinguished.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
is
not.
as
we
say,
we're
not
challenging--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
as
we
say,
we're
not
challenging
the
ability
for
habeas
corpus
review.
if
that
was
an
issue,
the
proper
disposition
would
be
to
allow--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
if
there
was
going
to
be
judicial
review,
it
would
be
along
the
lines
of
carlson,
which
is
whether
the
attorney
general
has
exercised
that
power
arbitrarily.
we
think
there
probably
might
be
a
constitutional
component
to
that
to
the
extent
the
court
concludes
that
there
is
any
residual
liberty
interest
at
all.
that
would
be
the
proper
way
to
address
this,
not
to
attack
as
a
substantive
due
process
matter,
which
is
all
that's
here.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
under
carlson--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
i
think
under
carlson
there
was
review
of
those
individualized
custody
determinations.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
that
is
absolutely
correct,
but
the...
again,
coming
back
to
the
central
issue
in
this
case,
all
that
is
at
issue
here
is
whether
the
attorney
general's
detention
pursuant
to
expressed
statutory
authority
is
reasonably
related
to
the
goals
that
have
been
advanced,
and
as
long
as
the
person
was
found
by
the
attorney
general
to
be
dangerous
or
a
flight
risk,
the
detention
is
reasonably
related,
and
that
detention
is
subject
to
periodic,
automatic
review
by
the
attorney
general
every
year,
and
in
intervening
periods
the
alien
can
request
a
review
of
his
status
by
presenting
changed
material
circumstances.
in
that
situation,
we
think
that
is
a
very
reasonable
response
on
behalf
of
the
two
political
branches
about
how
to
deal
with
the
severe
problem
of
dangerous
criminal
aliens
in
our
midst.
it
is
an
inherent
part
of
the
sovereignty
of
every
nation
to
protect
itself
against
aliens
who
that
nation
does
not
believe
should
be
in
its
presence
for
purposes
of
national
sovereignty,
national
security,
but
also
the
safety
of
the
populace
of
that
country,
and
that
is
what
congress
and
the
attorney
general
are
responding
to.
safety
is
not
simply
a
question
to
be
addressed
by
the
states.
when
it
comes
to
aliens
in
this
country,
it
is
congress'
responsibility,
not
that
of
the
states,
or
in
addition
to
that
of
the
states,
to
protect
the
populace
of
the
united
states
against
the
presence
of
dangerous
criminal
aliens
in
the
united
states,
and
that
is
what
has
been
done
here
on
the
basis
of
a
criminal
prosecution
and
administrative
procedures
that
unquestionably
satisfied
due
process,
and
the
only
remaining...
in
terms
of
giving
congress
an
interest
with
respect
to
aliens,
it
is
the
equivalent
of
a
state's
interest
with
respect
to
the
mentally
ill.
in
that
situation,
it
is
directly
parallel
to
the
interests
of
a
state.
when
does
a
state
come
in
and
intervene
with
respect
to
the
liberty
interest
of
an
individual?
with
respect
to
civil
commitment,
it
is
in
the
context
of
mental
illness
which
gives
the
state
a
right
to
come
in
and
look
after
the
individual
and
protect
the
individual
and
the
state.
with
respect
to
aliens,
it
is
congress'
plenary
power.
that
has
been
satisfied.
that
has
been
permanently
extinguished,
that
liberty
interest.
all
that
remains,
then,
is
the
question
of
dangerousness,
and,
as
this
court
has
held
in
the
civil
commitment
cases,
a
state
may
place
on
the
alien
the
burden
of
showing
that
he
is
no
longer
dangerous
at
the
end
of
a
particular
period.
there
have
been
no
questions
here
about
the
statutory
authority
of
the
attorney
general
to
detain
the
aliens,
but
we
think
it
is
clear
that
the
attorney
general
has
that
authority
conferred
by
congress.
