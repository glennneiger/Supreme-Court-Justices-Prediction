well,
do
you
think
that
some
reasonable
period
of
time
is
permitted
under
that
language?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
which
circuit
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
you
talking
about
the
fifth
or
the
ninth?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they're
both
out,
aren't
they,
and
under
certain
terms
and
conditions?
what's
the
situation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
are
new,
proposed
regulations
dealing
with
this
subject.
is
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
there
some
opportunity
for
judicial
review
after
a
period
of
time
under
the
proposed
new
regulations,
do
you
know?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
nothing
expressed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
both
these
cases
are
here
on
habeas--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--proceedings?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
barnard--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
barnard,
would
you
be
making
your
same
argument
and
seeking
release
if
the
government
were
holding
someone
like
your
client
in
a
detention
center
as
opposed
to
a
prison
facility,
or
were
ordered
to
remain
in
his
own
house
and
not
leave
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
a
detention
center
of
some
kind,
as
opposed
to
a
prison?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where
it's
not
a
criminal
facility.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
would
be
a
very
different
question--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--conditions.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
they
had
served
their
sentences,
presumably.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
case
of
ours
do
you
think
best
supports
your
position
of
the
validity
of
this
scheme?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
didn't
that
involve
more
aliens
who
can
be
rejected
on
entry?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
we're
trying
to
explore
what
precedent
of
this
court
comes
closest
to
saying
that,
based
on
the
prior
conviction
of
someone
who
was
lawfully
here
at
the
time
of
that
conviction,
can
the
government,
by
administrative
order,
detain
the
person
indefinitely
because
of
dangerousness.
what
case
do
you
rely
on?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
know
there
are
lots
of
questions,
but
i
want
you
to
answer
this
one--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--if
you
would.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
pardon
me?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
there
any
apa
review
of
the
exercise
of
the
attorney
general's
discretion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
salerno
and
in
hendricks
and
in
these
other
situations
where
people
are
being
held
and
detained,
there
has
been
judicial
review
of
that
detention
order,
and
there
is
no
such
provision
here,
is
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
that
is
one
difficulty
with
your
position.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
but
under
your
view,
that
has
to
automatically
be
denied.
there
simply
is
no
opportunity
here
for
judicial
review
of
the
determination
of
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general
in
reviewing
the
conditions
under
which
someone
might
be
released
with
safety.
