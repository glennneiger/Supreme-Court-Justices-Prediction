justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
stansell,
what
do
you
mean
by
a
reasonable
time?
do
you
mean
there's
an
absolute
time
limit?
i
guess
the
government
here
would
say
that
they're
not
holding
them
beyond
a
reasonable
time,
that
the
time
that
is
reasonable
is
the
time
that
is
necessary
to
protect
the
public
from
depredations
by
these
people,
who
are
deportable
because
they've
committed
crimes.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
an
absolute
time
limit
at
some
point,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
even
if
you're
talking
about,
you
know,
a
real
life
hannibal
what's
his
name,
you
know,
a
really
wicked,
evil
person
who
is
going
to
harm
people,
there's
every
reason
to
believe
that
this
person
who's
been
deported
because
of
serial
murders,
if
you
can't
find
a
country
to
send
him
to,
you
have
to
let
that
person
out?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
any
other
person
is
entitled
to
be
in
the
united
states.
would
it
be
unconstitutional
for
the
law
on
its
face,
when
aliens
are
admitted,
to
say
that
you
are
admitted
to
this
country
only
on
the
condition
of
good
behavior,
and
that
that
permission
will
be
terminated
if
you
commit
a
felony,
and
upon
its
termination,
it
is
up
to
you
to
find
a
country
to
get
sent
back
to.
the
burden
is
not
on
us,
and
if
you
can't
find
a
country,
you're
not
going
to
be
allowed
into
the
public
in
this
country,
where
you
have
not
been
given
any
permission
to
be?
why
is
that
unreasonable?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know.
i'm
just
spelling
it
out
more
explicitly,
that
the
condition
of
your
admission
is
this
should
you
commit
a
felony,
your
permission
to
be
among
the
general
public
in
the
united
states
is
terminated
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
we
will
send
you
back
to
whatever
country
you
can
find
that
will
take
you,
but
if
no
country
will
take
you,
you
will
not
be
allowed
into
the
general
populace.
that
permission
has
not
been
given,
period.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
stansell,
what
if...
these
people
are
deportable
because
of
committing
felonies,
right?
what
if
the
punishment
for
the
felony
were
life
in
prison?
that,
i
assume,
would
not
be
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
why
is
it
unconstitutional
to
say
to
an
immigrant,
if
you
commit
a
felony,
we're
not
going
to
put
you
in
prison
for
life,
but
we
are
simply
not
going
to
let
you
back
into
the
general
populace,
and
we
will
deport
you
if
you
can
find
a
place
to
be
deported
to,
but
otherwise
you
will
be
held
under
house
arrest,
not
punitive,
but
you
will
not
be
allowed
into
the
general
population?
why
is
that
lesser
punishment,
if
you
consider
it
that,
although
it
really
isn't
punishment,
it's...
you
know,
that
was
the
deal.
why
is
that
lesser
sanction
unconstitutional,
whereas
sending
the
felon
to
jail
for
life
and
punitive
treatment
for
life
would
not
be
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
appeal
to
the
sanction
that
you're
challenging
here.
i
mean,
you're
saying
they're
doing
well
because
they
know
if
they
go
back
in
they're
going
to
be
there
for
life.
you
want
to
eliminate
that
sanction,
so
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
not
fair
to
rely
on
it,
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
they...
are
they
really
going
that
far?
i
don't
think
they
are.
i
think
they're
acknowledging
that
these
individuals
have
to
be
released
if
there's
no
threat
to
the
general
public
from
them
and
if
there's
no
doubt
that
they
can
be...
that
they
won't
flee,
and
they
can
be
found
and
deported
if
and
when
a
country
can
be
found
to
send
them
to.
the
government
acknowledges
all
of
that,
and
under
mezei
you
wouldn't
have
to
let
these
people
out
at
all,
even
if
you
knew
that
they
wouldn't
flee,
and
even
if
you
knew
that
they
might
possibly
pose
a
threat
to
the
public,
isn't
that
right?
that's
how
i
understand
mezei.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
they're
not
going
as
far
as
extending
mezei
to
these
people
entirely.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
have
to
be
those
findings,
and
in
mezei
there
don't
have
to
be
those
findings.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
treating
them
differently--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they're
extending
it,
but
i
think
it
goes
too
far
to
say
that
the
exception
has
swallowed
the
rule
and
that
they're
just
covering
everybody
with
the
mezei
rule.
i
think
this
rule
is
a
good
deal
more
limited
than
mezei.
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
you're
appealing
to
the
proposition
that
you
just
said
you
were
appealing
to,
that
you
can't
treat
aliens
any
different
from
american
citizens
in
this
regard,
then
you...
justice
kennedy
has
to
be
right.
you
shouldn't
be
able
to
hold
him
for
any
period
just
because
you're
worried
that
he'll
commit
another
crime.
i
mean,
surely
that's
the
way
we
treat
citizens.
you
can't
hold
a
citizen
in
jail
because
you're
worried
he's
going
to
commit
a
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
have
to
be
appealing
to
something
a
little
less
than
the
proposition
that
you
have
to
treat
aliens
like
citizens.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
barnard,
wouldn't
the
foreseeability
be
considerably
affected
by
the
rule
that
you're
urging
upon
us?
if
i
were
the
minister
of
interior,
whoever
is
responsible
for
making
these
determinations
in
the
federal
republic
of
germany,
let
us
say,
and
the
united
states
wants
to
send
back
the
person
that
they
say
is
a
german
citizen,
who
is
obviously
a
bad
actor
and
he's
committed
a
lot
of
crimes,
and
that
fits
the
description
of
at
least
one
of
the
two
here,
i
would
not
be
very
much
inclined
to
say,
oh
yes,
he
is
a
german
citizen,
send
him
back.
now,
i
might
be
inclined
to
do
that
if
i
knew
that
the
poor
devil
is
not
going
to
be
allowed
into
the
general
population,
that
his
choice
is
to
be
kept
in
detention
in
the
united
states.
you're
loading
the
dice
against
anybody
being
willing
to
take
back
bad
actors.
why
should
they
do
it?
the
consequence
of
not
taking
them
back
is,
they'll
just
be
released
in
the
general
public
in
the
united
states
instead
of
in
the
federal
republic
of
germany.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
about
the
impact
upon
the
foreign
countries
that
we
are
trying
to
extradite
these
people
to,
or
deport
these
people
to.
it
has
to
have
an
effect
upon
them
if
they
know
that
the
effect
of
their
saying
no
is
really
not
very
much
hardship
on
the
individual
that's
involved.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
also
assume
that
one
of
the
things
that
induces
these
foreign
countries
to
take
them
back
is
lobbying
and
pressure
from
the
individual
himself
and
from
his
family,
and
they
have
a
great
incentive
to
do
that
if
the
consequence
of
germany's
not
taking
him
back
is
that
he's
going
to
remain
under
restriction,
as
here,
but
if
that
is
not
the
case,
what
incentive
in
the
world
would
they
have
to
induce
the
federal
republic
of
germany
to
take
him
back?
if
they
don't
take
him
back,
he
will
have
achieved
exactly
what
he
wants,
which
is
to
stay
in
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
can
define
him
to
be
a
citizen
or
not
to
be
a
citizen.
i
mean,
that's
a
judgment
to
be
made
by
the
authorities
in
germany.
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
status
depends
upon
a
lot
of
facts
that
require
to
be
determined
and
which
may
be
disputed,
which
is
the
case
in
at
least
one
of
these
two
cases,
the
facts
of
how
long
he
was
in
that
country,
or
what
his
ancestry
was,
and
so
forth.
there
are
always
those
disputes,
or
there
are
often
those
disputes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
are
you
conceding
that
that
is
relevant
to
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
assume
you're
saying
that
if
another
country
can't
be
found,
and
even
once
it's
certain
that
another
country
can't
be
found,
the
attorney
general
can
still
refuse
to
release
this
person
into
the
general
population
as
long
as
there
is
a
threat
of
flight
or
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
we
often
determine
what
procedures
are
due
on
the
basis
of
legal
status,
don't
we?
you're
saying
legal
status
here
is
the
same
because
the
law
changes.
justice
antonin
scalia
citizens
have
a
different
legal
status
from
aliens,
and
they
are
entitled
to
greater
constitutional
protections,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
--resident
aliens
have
different
legal
status
from
nonresident
aliens,
and
so
forth,
so
there's
nothing
extraordinary--
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
not
dumping
them
in
the
sea,
are
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think
the
case
is
in
point,
because
as
i
understand
your
argument
the
basis
for
the
government's
holding
these
people,
to
which
you're
appealing,
is
not
that
the
government
has
the
power
to
hold
people
who
are
dangerous.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
you're
appealing
to
is
the
government's
power
to
keep
out
of
the
united
states
people
who
have
no
right
to
be
in
the
united
states--
justice
antonin
scalia
--period.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
is
your
position,
i
assume,
that
even
if
they
weren't
dangerous,
the
united
states
would
not
have
to
allow
people
who
have
no
right
to
be
here
to
wander
at
will
throughout
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
isn't
there
judicial
review
of
the
essential
determination
that
you
say
gives
the
attorney
general
the
power
here,
and
that
is
the
determination
that
this
person
has
no
right
to
be
in
the
united
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
full
judicial
review.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
the
source
of
your
power.
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
put
any
pressure
on
the
foreign
government
to
take
him
back,
or
even
to
provide
the
documents
necessary
for
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
meanwhile
he's
wandering
at
large
in
the
population.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
why
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
is
the
issue
in
this
case?
i
thought
the
issue
in
this
case
was
whether
he
has
to
be
released
into
the
general
population.
that's
not
the
case?
are
we
talking
about
only
whether
you
could
put
him
under
house
arrest
and--
