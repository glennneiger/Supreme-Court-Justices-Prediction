justice
david
h.
souter
well,
would
you
change
the
hypothetical,
then,
slightly
and
say
that
there
is
a
provision
of
the
united
states
code
that
anyone
who
is
convicted
of
a...
anyone
in
the
immigrant
status
who
is
convicted
of
a
felony
in
the
united
states
will
be
punished
by
imprisonment
up
to
life,
and
the
sentence
in
fact
can
be
terminated
upon
deportation,
if
deportation
is
possible?
no
administrative
imposition
here.
the
imposition
would
be
by
a
court
at
sentencing.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
that
would
be
the...
i
presume
that
would
be
the
issue
under
the
hypothetical
that
i've
raised,
so
would...
on
my
variation
of
the
hypo,
would
it
be
unconstitutional
for
the
government
to
imprison?
justice
david
h.
souter
determination
of
immigrant
status
is
made
by
a
jury.
all
the
facts
are
found
as
a
jury
needs
to
find
them.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
let's
apply
it.
i
mean,
would
you
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
with
my
variation
and
justice
stevens'
gloss--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
let's
assume
that
the
statute
providing
for
the...
for
potential
life
imprisonment
subject
to
deportation
was
in
place
at
the
time
that
a
given
immigrant
was
admitted.
on
that
assumption,
would
it
be...
would
the
sentencing
scheme
be
constitutional?
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
but
we're...
the
problem
is,
maybe
the
government
isn't
able
to
deport.
maybe
the
current
situation
occurs
in
the
instance
of
the
hypothetical
with
its
glosses.
in
that
circumstance,
in
your
view,
is
it
constitutional
for
the
government
to
imprison
up
to
life?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
it's
the
imposition
of
the
sentence
that
i
described.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
sentencing
scheme
which
is
in
place
when
the
immigrant
is
admitted
provides
that
in
the
case
of
conviction
for
a
felony
by
such
an
immigrant,
the
immigrant
may
be
imprisonment...
may
be
imprisoned
for
a
period
up
to
life,
provided
that
that
term
may
be
reduced
if
it
is
possible
for
the
government
to
extradite,
and
does...
not
extradite,
deport,
and
does
successfully
deport.
would
that
scheme,
if
in
place
when
the
immigrant
comes
in,
be
constitutionally
enforceable?
justice
david
h.
souter
well
the...
but
the
government's...
i
mean,
if
it
comes
to
justification,
the
government's
justification
is
going
to
be
essentially
what
we
have
heard
here,
and
that
is
that
it
is
demonstrably
more
difficult
to
keep
track
of
such
individuals
so
that
they
may
be
deported
if,
in
fact,
it
is
possible
to
deport
them,
and
number
2,
the
recidivism
rate
by
such
individuals
is
distinctly
higher
than
the
recidivism
rate
in
the
generally
released
criminal
population,
so
those
would
be
the
two
justifications
for
the
disparate
treatment.
would
those
justifications
be
constitutionally
adequate?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
is
not
a--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
may
i
go
back
to
that
question
mr.
kneedler,
because
there's
an
issue
that's
come
up.
i
think
it's
inherent
in
justice
stevens'
question,
and
i
think
it
was
raised
by
your
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
hendricks
question,
and
i
think
it's
focused
by
one
of
the
green
briefs,
amicus
briefs
filed
by,
i
think
it
was
a
group
of
law
professors,
and
they
said,
what's
wrong
with
the
government's
argument
that
the
order
of
deportation
converts
the
individual
back
to
the
status
of
someone
who
has
not
yet
been
admitted
is
this
the
status,
the
constitutional
status
of
the
individual
who
has
never
been
admitted
rests
upon
a
patent
fiction,
and
the
patent
fiction
is
that
the
individual
is
not
in
the
united
states,
when
we
all
know
that
the
individual
is
in
the
united
states.
illegally,
yes,
but
in
the
united
states,
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
distinguish
between
citizens
and
others
in
this
respect.
it
may
very
well
be
that
that
legal
fiction
is
a
very
justifiable
fiction,
because
otherwise
the
united
states
is
defenseless
against
mariel
boat
lifts
and
things
like
that,
but
it's
another
thing,
as
justice
stevens'
question
suggests,
to
extend
that
legal
fiction
and
say
that
the
legal
fiction
takes
you
one
step
more,
and
that
is,
we're
going
to
now
assume
that
an
entire
further
class
of
individuals,
in
fact,
is
not
in
the
united
states
and
is
not
subject
to
whatever
the
territorial
claim
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
seems
to
respect.
what
is
your
answer
to
the
problem
of
extending
legal
fictions,
because,
what's
in
back
of
my
mind
is,
in
the
back
of
my
mind
is,
if
legal
fictions
can
support
this
restriction
back
on
whatever
the
rights
of
persons
are,
then
i
suppose
other
legal
fictions
could
accomplish
the
same
purpose
for
other
classes,
so
what
is
your
response
to
the
problem
of
legal
fictions?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
that's
a
statutory
definition.
justice
david
h.
souter
fine,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--inadmissible,
but
nonetheless
has
been
admitted.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
very...
i
don't
doubt
that
that
is
true
so
far
as
legal
definitions
are
concerned,
but
that
doesn't
drive
the
constitutional
inquiry.
the
constitutional
inquiry
in
effect
says,
yes,
we'll
accept
the
legal
fiction
that
the
person
who
has
never
been
admitted
is,
in
fact,
not
in
the
united
states,
but
now
you
want
that
same
process...
and
there
may
be
a
justification
for
it.
we
might
have
found
a
more
candid
way
of
doing
it,
but
i
can
see
the
justification.
you
now
want
to
extend
that
fiction
to
somebody
who
has
been
in
the
united
states
for
quite
sometime
and
is
still
here,
and
the
fact
that
the
statute
may
by
definition
say,
they're
the
same,
obviously
doesn't
control
the
constitutional
inquiry.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
whether
there
is
or
is
not
a
substantive
due
process
problem,
it
seems
to
be
the
case
that
you
still
want
to
respond
to
the
substantive
due
process
argument
by
saying
that
the
people
who
have
been
admitted
ordered
deported
are
exactly
in
the
same
status
for
constitutional
purposes
as
those
who
have
never
been
admitted.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
one
is
a
fiction,
the
second
is
a
greater
one.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
were
any
of
those
presumptions
operative
on
purely
administrative
determinations?
i
would
have
thought
not.
i
mean,
that's
justice
o'connor's
question.
