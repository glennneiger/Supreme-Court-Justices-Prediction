in
your
view,
would
it
make
any
difference
whether
such
a
law
was
passed
before
or
after
the
alien
entered
the
country?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
they'd
be
entitled
to
notice
that
that
was
the
consequence
of
coming
into
the
united
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
just
as
a
matter
of
clarification,
if
this...
if
your
client
were
a
german
citizen,
would
germany
have
the
option
to
take
him
or
let
him
stay
here,
or
would
they
not
be
obligated
to
take
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
so
really
the
question
whether
he
gets
back
or
not
depends
on
whether
he's
a
citizen
of
the
country
that
they
want
to
deport
him
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you're
not
assuming
that
the
germans
just
do
this
willy
nilly,
and
they
don't
have
rules
that
decide
whether
these
people
are
citizens
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
assume
he
either
is
or
he
isn't,
under
the
law
of
that
country.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
may
i
ask
just
one
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--on
that
point?
does
your
case,
your
submission
depend
on
an
assumption
that
these
people
are
more
dangerous
than
citizens
who
have
committed
precisely
the
same
crime?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
kneedler,
isn't
there
a
vast
difference
between
saying,
if
a
person...
partly
fictional...
has
never
been
in
the
country
at
all,
he
has
never
acquired
the
protection
of
the
constitution,
isn't
that
quite
different
from
saying
that
a
person
who
has
acquired
that
protection,
simply
because
an
order
of
deportation
has
been
entered,
he
totally
loses
the
protection?
isn't
there
a
difference
between
the
two?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
kneedler,
i
would
like
to
ask
you
a
question
right
on
the
liberty
interest
point.
do
you
read
mezei
as
merely
holding
that
the
person
at
the
border
has
no
liberty
interest
in
roaming
around,
or
is
it
rather
that
he
is
not
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
in
the
opinion...
and
there's
nothing
in
the
opinion
that
talks
in
those
terms.
he's
just
a
person
who
has
no
right
to
be
here.
he
is
not
a
person
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
he's
never
got
in
the
united
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
what
are
the
conditions
of
the
releases
of
the
two
litigants
in
this
case
now?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
reason
why
those
very
conditions
that
are
in
place
now
would
not
be
adequate
as
a
general
rule,
subject
to
severe
punishment
if
they
were
violated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
insofar
as
you
rely
on
threat
to
the
community,
it's
the
same
threat
for
the
citizen
who
had
the
same
criminal
history.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
the
balance
different
if
you're
just
relying
on
future
dangerousness?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
conceded
earlier
it's
no
stronger
than
it
is
for
the
average
citizen.
