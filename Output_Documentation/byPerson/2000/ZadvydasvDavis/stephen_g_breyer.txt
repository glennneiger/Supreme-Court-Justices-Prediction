justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
question.
we
agree
it's
a
civil
statute.
how
many
days
after
the
90
in
these
two
cases
would
you
say
that
there
is
a
factor
involved
of
not
knowing
whether
you
could
find
a
country
for
them?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
i'm
just
trying
to
figure
out,
though...
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
issue
is
in
this
case,
and
i'm
having
some
trouble,
because
i
want
to
know...
to
separate
out
the
problem
that
you're
just
talking
about,
risk
of
crime--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'd
like
to
know...
think
of
90
as
beginning--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
how
many
extra
days
before
it
became
clear
that
no
country
will
take
them?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it's
not
clear
now,
then
what
is
it
that
we're
supposed
to
be
deciding?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
at
that
moment,
if
it's
not
clear
now,
there
is
involved
in
both
of
these
cases
the
question
of
whether
it
would
be
reasonable
to
maintain
them
simply
to
be
sure
they're
around
if
you
find
a
country.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
is,
is
that
question
in
front
of
us?
do
you
deny
the
following,
that
this
statute
does
not
give
authority
to
hold
an
alien
beyond
a
reasonable
time?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
think
it
does?
do
you
think...
in
other
words,
are
you
saying,
is
it
the
government's
position
that
the
statute
gives
the
authority
to
put
an
alien,
after
90
days...
to
hold
him
beyond
a
reasonable
time?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
take
your
second
answer,
because
that
has
two
parts,
your
first
saying
we
won't
hold
him
beyond
a
reasonable
time,
but
what
do
we
look
at
in
deciding
reasonableness?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that...
am
i
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
satisfied
with
this
holding
on
the
merits,
this
statute
means
no
one
should
be
held
beyond
a
reasonable
time.
reasonable
time
is
related
to
whether
there's
another
country
available,
but
in
addition,
where
that's
unclear
the
court
can
take
account
of
the
risk
that
he
poses
to
the
community?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree
there
are--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
it
what
we're
arguing
about
now,
or
discussing,
is
whether
the
attorney
general
has
the
right
to
put
this
person
in
custody
for
his
entire
life
solely
on
the
basis
of
risk,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
this
case
really
raises
that,
but
if
it
does,
so
be
it,
and
my
question
to
you
would
be
simply
this.
is
there
any
precedent
at
all,
where
the
constitution,
which
says
no
person
shall
be
deprived
of
liberty
without
due
process
of
law,
justifies
putting
a
sane
human
being
in
the
united
states,
depriving
him
of
his
liberty
forever
on
the
basis
of
an
administrative
order,
no
judge,
no
jury,
no
judicial
process?
i
just
can't
think
of
an
instance,
and
i
would
be
surprised
if
other
countries
with
similar
systems
do
such
a
thing,
depriving
a
person
of
his
liberty
forever,
on
the
basis
simply
of
an
administrative
order,
so
what
is
the
precedent?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
no
doubt
you
could
do
that
as
a
criminal
punishment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
what
we're
talking
about?
that's
a
judicial
process.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
my
problem
is
the
problem
that
judicial
due
process,
normally
means
judicial
process
where
you
are
depriving
a
person
of
liberty.
i
can't...
it's
very
hard
to
think
of
instances...
well,
i'd
be
repeating
my
question,
but
i
mean,
i
have
no
problem,
because
if
you're
talking
about
the
criminal
process,
it's
a
criminal
punishment
administered
by
a
judge
and
a
jury,
so
if
you're
saying
that's
what's
at
issue
here,
i'm
right
with
you.
my
problem
is
that
that's
not
what's
at
issue
here--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
my
understanding.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
these
cases
involve
deportation.
i
think
my
question
was
precedent
in
respect
to
putting
a
person
in
prison--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
fong
yue
ting,
if
i'm
right,
was
a
case
where
the
court
was
considering
a
law
that
said
you
had
to
have
a
credible,
white
witness
for
a
chinese
person
to
remain
in
the
united
states,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
i'm
not
sure
about
the
strength
of
that
precedent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
for
deportation,
i'll
take
that
as...
we're
not
considering--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--can
i
just
focus
on
one
thing
that
you
were
just
pointing
out?
i'll
tell
you
exactly
what
my
problem
is.
i
agree
with
you
that
these
former
cases
that
you
cited
do
give
congress
tremendous
power
over
deportation,
whatever
their
facts,
but
to
my
mind,
putting
a
person
in
jail,
or
in
confinement
for
the
rest
of
his
life,
however
bad
deportation
is,
this
is
a
lot
worse,
and
i
can't
find
precedent
to
answer
it,
and
i
think
you
now
agree
there
isn't
precedent,
and
so
aren't
we
left
with
just
deciding,
that
seems
so
much
worse,
must
there
be
judicial
process,
or
is
administrative
process
good
enough?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
am
announcing
the
opinion
in
zadvydas
the
under
down
and
ashcroft
v.
ma.
the
case
focuses
upon
aliens
whom
a
court
has
ordered
removed
from
the
united
states,
say,
because
they
have
committed
crimes
or
otherwise
violated
the
law.
the
statute
says
that
such
an
alien
is
supposed
to
be
removed
i.e.
sent
to
another
country
within
90
days
of
the
removal
order
becoming
final,
but
suppose
the
attorney
general
cannot
bring
about
the
aliens’
removal
within
those
90
days.
a
special
provision
of
the
statute
provides
that
in
such
a
case,
certain
aliens,
including
those
who
the
attorney
general
determines
may
run
away
or
pose
a
danger
to
the
community
“maybe
detained
beyond
the
removal
period.”
but
the
statute
doesn’t
say
how
long
beyond
the
removal
period?
they
maybe
detain
forever.
the
case
before
us
involves
aliens,
who
no
other
country
will
take,
at
least
not
so
far,
and
we
hold
in
interpreting
the
provision
as
applied
to
those
aliens
who
are
in
confinement,
that
the
statute
does
not
permit
the
attorney
general
to
keep
them
in
custody
indefinitely,
but
rather
it
implicitly
limits
custody
to
a
period
reasonably
necessary
to
bring
about
the
alien’s
removal.
we
fear
that
any
other
interpretation,
say,
an
interpretation
authorizing
indefinite
confinement
would
raise
a
serious
constitutional
problem
relating
to
deprivation
of
liberty,
say,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
fifth
amendment,
and
we
believe
that
congress
would
have
preferred
an
interpretation
of
the
statute,
that
assured
a
statute
that
is
constitutional
to
an
interpretation
that
because
potentially
unconstitutional
would
mean
a
serious
risk
of
no
statute
at
all.
the
government
denies
that
there
is
a
serious
constitutional
problem.
it
points
out
that
in
certain
circumstances,
the
law
permits
detention
to
be
imposed
without
a
criminal
trial,
and
here
it
says,
that
indefinite
detention
of
aliens
ordered
removed
is
justified
in
order
to
ensure
the
appearance
of
those
aliens
at
future
immigration
proceedings
and
to
protect
the
community
from
harm.
but
the
first
justification
preventing
flight
to
avoid
removal
is
weak
when
removal
seems
unlikely
ever
to
occur,
and
as
far
as
the
second
justification
is
concerned,
the
constitution
permits
forms
of
preventive
detention
to
avert
community
harm
only
in
very
special
situations,
limited
to
circumstances
involving
especially
dangerous
individuals
and
subject
to
strong
procedural
protections.
this
statute,
however,
applies
broadly,
even
to
aliens
ordered
removed
for
tourist
visa
violations.
the
procedural
protections
it
provides
are
basically
administrative
not
judicial,
and
there
is
no
special
factor,
such
as
mental
illness,
which
makes
these
aliens
anymore
dangerous
than
other
individuals
who
have
been
convicted
of
crimes
and
served
their
sentences.
the
government
adds
that
the
fact
that
the
individuals
involved
or
aliens
and
have
been
ordered
removed
makes
the
situation
special
enough,
but
we
do
not
think
that
these
circumstances
are
sufficient
to
justify
what
could
become
in
affect
a
form
of
preventive
detention
lasting
years
or
for
life.
the
government
points
as
authority
to
a
case
called
shaughnessy
v.
united
states
ex
rel.
mezei,
a
case
in
which
this
court
found
an
alien’s
indefinite
detention
constitutional.
but
mezei
involved
an
alien
who
had
not
in
a
technical
legal
sense
entered
the
united
states.
the
distinction
between
aliens
who
have
entered
as
here
and
those
who
have
not
as
in
mezei
runs
through
out
immigration
law.
we
here
consider
aliens
who
have
entered
and
are
now
being
removed,
thus
mezei
does
not
govern
the
circumstances
presented.
in
order
to
guide
the
lower
courts
in
applying
the
limitation
that
we
annunciate
that
of
a
period
reasonably
necessary
to
secure
removal,
we
recognize
as
presumptively
reasonable
a
six
month
period
of
detention,
a
period
recognized
by
congress
previously
as
a
reasonable
removal
period.
after
this
time
if
the
alien
provides
good
reason
to
believe
that
there
is
no
significant
likelihood
of
removal
in
the
reasonably
foreseeable
future,
then
the
government
must
respond
with
evidence
to
rebut
that
showing.
we
note
that
in
applying
this
principle,
courts
must
take
account
of
the
relevant
foreign
policy
expertise
of
the
executive
branch,
listening
with
care
for
example,
to
its
estimate
of
when
removal
is
likely
to
occur.
we
explain
all
this
further
and
with
more
detail
in
our
opinion,
more
precisely.
we
vacate
the
lower
court
decisions
and
remand
the
case
for
further
consideration
in
light
of
the
principles
we
annunciate.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
which
justice
thomas
has
joined;
justice
kennedy
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion,
which
the
chief
justice
has
joined
and
which
justices
scalia
and
thomas
have
joined
in
part.
