can
they
be
detained,
under
your
view,
for
a
reasonable
time
after
the
90
day
period?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
in
determining
the
reasonableness
of
the
more
lengthy
detention
period,
do
we
take
into
account
the
fact
that
there
are
review
procedures,
and
that
the
government
under
its
regulations
has
to
give
periodic
review?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
part
of
the
reasonableness--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--calculation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
are
not
those
periodic
review
procedures
in
place
now
because
of
the
regulations?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that's
the
basis...
that's
the
rationale
for
the
detention.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
say
they
can
be
held
for
a
reasonable
period
of
time,
but
that
an
element
of
the
detention
is
not
the
fact
that
they're
a
danger
to
the
community.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
is
or
is
not
one
of
the
elements?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
it's
one
of
the
elements
to
be
considered,
and
there's
a
periodic
review,
then
why
isn't
that
reasonable
under
the
definition
we're
discussing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
could
detain
a
person
for,
say,
6
extra
months
because
he's
dangerous,
but
not
after
that,
or
a
year?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
reason
for
the
detention
continues,
i
don't
understand
the
basis
on
which
you
say
that
you're
entitled
to
release.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
either
they
can't
detain
him
for
any
period
at
all
because
he's
dangerous,
or
they
can
detain
him
during
the
period
that
he's
dangerous,
it
seems
to
me,
and
you're
somehow
splitting
the
difference.
i
don't
understand
how
you
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
view,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
cannot
detain
him
for
even
1
day
on
the
grounds
that
he's
a
danger
to
the
community,
after
the
90
day
period--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
i
just
don't
think
you've
explained
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
many
of
those
50
percent
had
previously
been
determined
to
be
dangerous
to
the
community?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
other
than
mezei.
and
please
try
to
answer
the
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
certainly
true.
with
the
alien
himself,
it
seems
to
me
he
has
no
incentive
whatever--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
the
regulations
provide
for
periodic
review--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--would
carlson
allow
judicial
review
of
those
periodic
determinations?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
carlson
approach--
