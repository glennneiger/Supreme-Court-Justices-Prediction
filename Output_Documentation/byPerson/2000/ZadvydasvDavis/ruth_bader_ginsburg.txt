bader

okay--
--that's
not
the
ninth
circuit
rule,
though.
the
ninth
circuit
rule
was,
if
you
can't,
within
the
reasonably
foreseeable
future,
deport
this
person
because
no
one
will
have
him--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--then
you
must...
that's
the
ninth
circuit
rule.
i
think
what
you
were
saying,
urging
just
now,
is
something
different
from
that
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
say
there's
something...
that
it
might
be
something
different,
is
that
a
little
bit
like
plyler,
that
you
would
take
one
category
of
people
who
commit
the
same
offense
and
subject
them
to
much
harsher
punishment
than
another
class?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
these
people
were,
both
of
them...
your
client
was
how
old
when--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
any
kind
of
notice
would
have
to
be
imputed
to
the
infant
from
the
parents.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
barnard--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
barnard,
may
i
just
interrupt
you
there,
because
i
think
that
you
are
now
departing
from
what
you
said
you
were
adhering
to.
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
said
there
are
two
factors
here,
and
one
of
them
is,
can
this
person
be
deported
within
a
reasonably
foreseeable
time?
once
you're
sure
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no,
that's
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
i
don't
think
that
they
were
making
any
determination
based
on...
what
they
said
is,
people
serve
their
time,
we
let
them
out.
we
don't
take
into
account
how
dangerous
they
are
in
any
other
setting.
therefore,
the
only
legitimate
consideration
is,
does
the
government
have
a
reasonable
expectation
that
they
would
be
able
to
find
a
place
to
accept
this
person.
once
it's
clear
that
that's
not
in
the
cards,
then
it
isn't...
at
least
the
ninth
circuit
view
is,
it
doesn't
depend
upon
how
dangerous
this
person
is.
am
i
right
in
understanding
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
one
part
of
the
opinion
said,
if
you
know
that
there
is
no
hope
of
finding
somebody
to
take
him,
you
have
to
let
him
out
at
the
end
of
the
90
day
period.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
what
purpose,
and
the
purpose
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
there's
somebody
that
could
take
him.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
he
is
with
a
country
with
whom
we
have
an
expatriation
treaty,
then
there
isn't
any
discretion
on
that
country's
side,
any
more
than
there
would
be
on
our
side
in
the
reverse
situation,
so
you're
talking
about
countries
with
which
we
have
no
agreement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
stateless.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there's
always
a
plus.
i
mean,
this
case
is
different
from
that,
because
now
you're
relying
on
future
dangerousness,
period.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
mental
abnormality,
not
a
short
time
until
trial.
this
is
really
a
first,
and
i
don't
think
you
mean
to
walk
away
from
that,
so
it's
not
like
salerno,
and
it's
not
like
hendricks.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
would
be
separately
sanctionable,
would
it
not?
somebody
who...
if
you
just
had
the
portion
of
the
statute
that
says
you
can
hold
this
person
under
supervision,
and
that
person
in
supervision
did
not
do
what
he
was
told
to
do,
that's
independently
sanctionable,
is
it...
would
it
not
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
kneedler,
i
don't
follow
this
at
all,
frankly,
because
i
thought
the
so
called
entry
fiction,
there
was
a
benign
aspect
of
that.
in
other
words,
this
person
has
no
right
to
set
foot
on
u.s.
land,
but
we're
going
to
be
kind
to
that
person
and
not
dump
them
in
the
sea.
we
could
say,
you're
excludable,
so...
but
as
the
kind
of
price
for
saying,
oh,
we're
going
to
let
you
set
foot
on
land
and
not
drown
in
the
sea
or
starve
to
death,
but
we're
going
to
treat
you
as
though
you
never
came
in,
and
that's
a
fiction,
but
it's
a
benign
fiction,
because
the
alternative
is,
we
dump
you
in
the
sea.
it's
quite
different
when
you're
talking
about
someone
who
was
here,
who
was
part
of
the
community,
and
who
has,
as
you
say...
in
your
brief
i
think
you
say,
yes,
they
are
persons,
and
the
constitution
says,
nor
shall
any
person
be
denied
due
process,
so
it's
quite
different.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
there's
no
provision
for
judicial
review.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
argument
here
is,
then
you
lose
that.
once
you
lose
it
here,
there
isn't...
in
other
words,
if
you're
correct,
there
are
these
new
regulations
that
you
point
to,
but
that's
all
in
house.
it
would
be
no...
if
you
are
successful
today,
in
any
one
of
these
situations,
be
it
a
shoplifter,
be
it
someone
who
overstayed
a
visa
and
encountered
a
nasty
ins
person,
that
person
could
be
locked
up
forever
without
any
access
to
a
judge,
because
the
only
thing
is
whatever
process
the
administrator
has
chosen
to
give.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
are
saying,
once
that
determination...
no
right
to
be
in
the
united
states,
and
the
reason
is
that
you
committed
a
felony,
served
your
time.
you
are
saying,
yes,
after
that
there
is
no
access.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
that's
what
this
proceeding--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler,
you
were
explaining
something
before
and
then
got
detracted
from
it.
you
said,
it
affects
our
negotiations
with
cambodia,
and
i
was
trying
to
think,
how
would
it
affect
the
negotiations
knowing...
how
would
the
difference
between
putting
someone
into
prison
and
putting
someone
under
close
supervision,
how
that
would
affect
the
relation,
the
negotiating
relationship
of...
if
the
object
is
to
keep
this
person
from
doing
harm,
i
understand
that's
one
thing.
the
other
thing
is
our
negotiating
some
kind
of
expatriation
arrangement
with
cambodia.
what
is
the
relevant
difference
between
holding
that
person
in
prison
and
holding
them
under
close
supervision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
would
that
country
care...
i
just
don't
see
the
clog
in
the
negotiation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
see
your
point
about
a
dictator
who
dumps
people
on
this
country,
that's
the
excludable
class.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
of
course,
it's
not
involved
with
people
in
ma's
situation.
these
are
people
who
were
lawfully
admitted
as
resident
aliens.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
whatever
you
say
about
that,
it
doesn't...
these
people,
people
in
their
category
do
not
present
the
problem
of
dictators
dumping
people
in
the
united
states.
these
people
have
been
lawfully
admitted
as
permanent
residents.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
just
thinking
in
terms
of
your
foreign
policy
concerns
that
you
put
forward.
speaking
with
one
voice
to
a
dictator
and
saying,
we're
not
going
to
let
you
do
this
to
us
is
quite
different
from
saying,
yes,
we
welcomed
this
person
in
our
midst,
but
that
person
committed
a
crime,
we
don't
want
them
any
more.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it's
never
at
large,
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean,
that's...
you
use
that
expression
in
your
brief.
in
fact,
it's
not
wandering
at
large.
it's
under
close
supervision,
is
the
alternative.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that,
certainly
the
attorney
general
would
have
discretion
under
the
part
of
the
statute--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
authority
does
that
(a)(3)
part
of
the
statute
give
the
attorney
general,
the
part
that's
not
being
challenged,
whatever?
i
thought
under
supervision
could
be
rather
tight
supervision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that's
certainly
not,
as
justice
scalia
just
described,
at
large,
at
liberty.
that
is...
could
be
a
halfway
house.
