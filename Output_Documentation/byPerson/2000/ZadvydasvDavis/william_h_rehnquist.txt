chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
99-791,
kestutis
zadvydas
v.
the
ins
and
john
ashcroft
v.
kim
ho
ma.
mr.
barnard.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we're
talking
about
the
language,
"may
be
detained
beyond
the
removal
period?
"
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
construction
that
the
ins
has
put
on
it?
isn't
that
entitled
to
some
deference
under
our
chevron
rules?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
government
says
here
that
mr.
kestutis
is
in
the
same
position
as
someone,
as
an
entering
alien,
who
we've
said
has
virtually
no
constitutional
rights.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i...
we've
never
overruled
the
mezei
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we've
never
questioned
it
so
far
as
i
know.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you're
saying,
then,
that
even
though
an
alien
obtains
admission
to
this
country
illegally,
that
he's
fully
protected
by
our
constitution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
protected
in
what
sense?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean,
he
couldn't
be
picked
up
by
the
immigration
authorities
and
detained
because
he's
there
illegally?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
will
you...
answer
my
question,
if
you
will.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
stansell.
mr.
barnard,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
there
no
ongoing
negotiations...
i
got
the
impression
from
the
briefs
that
there
had
been
efforts
both
to
lithuania
and
some
other
country,
and
neither
of
them
had
presently
admitted
him,
but
that
it
was
not
regarded
as
completely
hopeless.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
she
hadn't
committed
any
felony.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
your
clients
have
committed
independent
felonies.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
don't
think
the
constitution
requires
you
to
treat
people
who
have
done
particular
things
the
same
way
as
people
who
have
not
done
those
things.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
person
is
not
an
alien,
and
the
government
has
much
more
power
over
aliens
than
it
does
over
citizens.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
aren't
national
security
concerns
always
at
stake
when
we're
talking
about
immigration
policy?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
whole
idea
of
control
of
the
borders
is
based
on
national
security.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
barnard.
mr.
kneedler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--your
questions
presented
don't
raise
the
issue
of
judicial
review
one
way
or
the
other.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
stansell,
you
and
your
colleague
have
reserved
a
little
more
than
1
1/2
minutes.
why
don't
you
use
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stansell.
the
case
is
submitted.
