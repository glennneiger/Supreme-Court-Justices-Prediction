mr.
robert
f.
barnard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
four
and
a
half
decades
ago
mr.
zadvydas
came
to
this
country
as
a
stateless
person.
he's
stateless
today,
and
in
all
probability
he
will
remain
that
way
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
because
of
this,
the
government
was
unable
to
deport
him.
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
your
honor,
as
a
factual
matter,
the
only
thing
that
has
happened
in
the
last
2
years
that
i
know
of
is
that
mr.
zadvydas
wrote
a
letter
to
the
consulate
in
chicago
seeking
some
citizenship
papers,
or
granting
him
citizenship,
and
other
than
that
nothing
has
happened
in
the
last
2
years.
at
issue
in
this
case,
the
constitutional
issue
in
this
case,
is
that
people
who
enter
this
country
are
regarded
as
persons
under
the
constitution
once
they
enter.
that
is
the
rule
that
pertains.
the
exception
to
that
rule
is
a
very
narrow
exception
which
is
called
the
entry
fiction,
which
is
applied
to
people
who
are
detained
or
interdicted
at
the
border,
and
what
the
government
is
proposing
here
is
to
have
the
exception
swallow
the
rule.
they
go
even
a
step
further
by
relying
on
the
mezei
case,
which
is
even
more
unique
than
the
way
the
entry
fiction
is
usually
employed.
in
mezei--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--well--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--well,
i
think
they
are,
but
as
far
as
the
constitutional
deprivation
that's
being
imposed
here,
they're
confining
people
indefinitely,
potentially
for
life,
based
on
a
finding
of
dangerousness
and/or
a
finding
of
a
flight
risk,
and--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--but
all
other
persons
in
this
country
can
be
released
if
the
detention
is
based
solely
on
dangerousness,
and
so
they're
treating--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--differently
than
the
rest
of
the
people
in
this
country--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--which
is
why
they
are
extending
mezei--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--and
mezei
is--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--this
court
in
plasencia
had
someone
who
was
much
more
analogous
to
the
person
in
mezei.
mezei
left
the
country,
tried
to
return.
in
plasencia,
the
lady
involved
in
that
case
left
and
tried
to
return,
and
this
court
did
not
see
a
need
to
extend
mezei
in
that
situation,
in
fact,
accorded
ms.
plasencia
her
due
process
rights,
and
that's
essentially
all
that
we're
asking
here
for--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--she
was
in
the
process
of
committing
a
crime
when
she
entered
the
country,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
yes,
and
i
would
get
back
to
the
point
i
made
a
moment
ago,
which
is
that
they're
being
treated
differently
than
any
other
class
of
persons
under
the
constitution
in
this
country.
we're
now
not
according
them
the
same
degree
of
constitutional
rights
we
would
some
else.
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
but
what
we're
saying,
your
honor,
is,
if
you
take
another
person
in
this
country
who
has
a
felony
conviction,
and
he's
determined
to
be
dangerous,
but
only
dangerous
and
not
some
other
element,
not
the
other
element
that
we
find
in
kansas
v.
hendricks,
a
mental
abnormality,
simply
dangerous
like
the
individual
in
foucha,
that
person
would
be
entitled
to
release.
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
which
is
another
reason,
perhaps,
that
release
would
be
more
called
for
in
this
instance,
because
the
court...
the
government
is
not
without
recourse
with
aliens
if
they
violate
their
terms
of
supervision.
we're
not
asking
for
mr.
ma
and
mr.
zadvydas
to
have
the
same
freedom
that
a
citizen
would
have.
they
would
be
under
supervision.
if
they
violated
the
terms
of
that
supervision
they
could
be
punished
for
up
to
1
year
for
failing
to
abide
by
the
terms
of
the
supervision,
and
they
could
be
punished
up
to
10
years
if
that
misbehavior
was
seen
as
obstructing
the
actual
deportation
process.
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
test,
the
civil
and
regulatory
detention
test
had
a
weighing
analysis
built
into
them.
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
yes,
i
believe
you
would
take
that
into
the
consideration.
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
but--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--well,
they're
in
place,
but
all
they're
really
considering
are
dangerousness
and
flight
risk.
the
government
contended
in
its
brief
that
the
newest
regulation
which
is
now
in
effect--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--i
understand
that,
your
honor,
but...
and
that's
the
position
of
mr.
ma
and
mr.
zadvydas,
is
that
the
way
the
regulation
is
constructed,
it
violates
a
basic...
the
basic
right
to
substantive
due
process.
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
well,
that's
one
of
the
elements,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--it
is
one
of
the
elements
to
be
considered,
but--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--because
it
doesn't
consider
the
likelihood
of
deportation
or
the
duration
of
detention,
your
honor.
people
are
being
detained
solely
because
either
they're
a
flight
risk
and/or
they're
a
danger,
so--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--well,
you
could
detain
him
for
a
reasonable
period.
i
don't
have
an
exact
time
period
or
bright
line
test.
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
well--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--what
we're
saying
is,
your
honor,
that
if
you
found
someone
to
be
dangerous...
and
the
ninth
circuit
says
in
its
opinion
that
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances
of
each
case.
if
someone
had
a
shoplifting
conviction
and
they
were
detained
for
90
days,
or
120
days,
and
it
wasn't
reasonably
foreseeable
they'd
be
deported,
perhaps
that
would
be
a
reasonable
period
to
release
them,
but
if
someone
had
a
more
serious
conviction,
i
believe
a
district
court
could
hold
them
somewhat
longer.
but
if
you're
asking
for
a
time
period,
i
would
suggest
that
the
traditional
time
periods
when
the
statute
was
silent...
the
1970
statute,
it
was
2
to
4
months,
the
statute
in
the
fifties
was
6
months...
and
that
would
be
a
guidepost,
but
at
some
point
you
could
not
detain
them
beyond
that,
because
the
person
is
being
held
merely
based
on
the
fact
that
he's
dangerous,
and
he's
being
treated
in
a
manner
that
is
different
than
any
other
person
in
this
country.
we
don't
have
one
set
of
constitutional
rules
for
citizens
and
another
set
for--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--well,
i
believe
the--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--well,
i
believe
the
ninth
circuit
said
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances
of
each
case,
and
the
example
i
would
give
is
the
one
i
just
did,
that--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--well,
your
honor,
we
would
submit
that
the
government
is
not
without
recourse
in
these
situations.
if
you
have
someone
that
is
truly
more
dangerous,
someone
like
a
hendricks
in
kansas
v.
hendricks,
there
would
be
nothing
preventing
the
government
from
having
the
state
they're
located
in
instituting
civil--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--all
that
i
can
say
in
answer
to
your
question,
your
honor,
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
did
say
that
there
could
be
a
period
after
that,
depending
on
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
and
that's
my
recollection.
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
i
think
the
opinion
is
somewhat
self
contradictory,
but
i
do
recall
there
was
language
in
there
that
you
could
hold
them
for
some
period
after
that
time.
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
to
determine
if
it
would...
if
there
was--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--if
it
was
reasonably
foreseeable
that
they
would
be
removed,
and
i
think
your
question
comes
down
to
what
is
reasonable,
or
what
is
reasonably
foreseeable,
and
it
may
vary
a
little
bit
from
someone
who
is
extremely
dangerous
to
someone
who
is
a
shoplifter,
but
it
would
not
be
a
lengthy
period
of
time.
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
the
statute
has
some
other
provisions
which
were
noted
in
the
briefs
where
we
can
withhold
visas,
or
take
actions
of
that
nature.
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
well,
your
honor,
i
would
just
point
out
that
in
every
immigration
case
there's
another
country
involved,
but
we
don't
go
to
the
extent
of
violating
a
person's
rights
to
further
the
immigration...
and
the
two
examples
would
be
wong
wing
and
witkovich.
there
were
other
countries
involved
in
those
cases,
and
not
only
did
this
court
reach
the
constitutional
issue,
but
resolved
it
in
the
alien's
favor.
so
if
there
were
some
attenuated
foreign
policy
interest
there,
i
would
say
that
this
court
in
previous
cases
has
not
allowed
that--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--yes,
your
honor.
again,
this
court
just
has
not
allowed
the
attenuated
interest
to
determine
the
constitutional
question
in
cases
where...
it's
always
going
to
be
present
in
the
case
with
an
immigrant,
because
there's
always
going
to
be
another
country,
even--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--i
think
under
the
reduction
convention
they
do
not
have
to
take
him
back,
but
i'm...
obviously--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--if
he's
stateless,
which
my
client
is,
there's
a
special--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--well,
if
they
find
him
not
to
be
a
citizen,
if
they
find
him
to
be
stateless
they
don't
have
to
take
him
back.
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
well,
i--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--or
the
person's
status
is--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--stateless,
yes.
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
well,
it
gets
back
to
what
is
reasonable
and
i
would
just
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
government
at
this
point
is
somewhat
less
than
sanguine
that
he's
going
to
be
taken
anywhere,
because
the
only
effort
that's
been
made
in
the
last
2
years
is
to
have
him
send
a
letter,
so
he
is
now,
the
state
department
negotiating
with
countries.
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
i
would
not
be
making
the
same
argument
if
it
was
a
house,
if
there
was
electronic
monitoring,
if
it
was
a
halfway
house.
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
i
think
that
would
turn
on
the
condition--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--well,
i
think
it
would
turn
on
the
conditions
of
detention
centers,
and
being
a
criminal
lawyer--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--well--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--well,
being
a
criminal
lawyer,
i've
never
seen
one
that
looked
particularly
appealing
to
the
average
person,
so
i
just
can't
imagine
that
that
would
be
the
case.
getting
back
to
some
other
aspects
of
mezei,
which
i
did
want
to
bring
the
court's
attention...
i
see
my
time
is
almost
up.
i
would
point
out
that
the
government's
theory
in
this
case
is
that
once
the
deportation
order
becomes
final,
the
individuals
are
stripped
of
their
constitutional
rights.
both
in
wong
wing
and
witkovich
deportation
orders
were
final
and
the
individuals
were
not
stripped
of
their
constitutional
rights.
in
fact,
this
court
reached
those
issues
and
decided
in
favor
of
the
alien.
i
would
also
point
out
that
mezei
really
should
be
limited
to
its
unique
set
of
facts.
i
mean,
there
were
all
kinds
of
national
security
concerns
at
play
in
that
case,
which
are
not
at
all
determinative
in
either
mr.
ma's
and
mr.
zadvydas--
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
in
wong
wing
national
security
was
at
issue.
he
was
just
being
removed
because
he
was
here
illegally.
mr.
robert
f.
barnard
no,
that's
national
sovereignty
i
think
you're
referring
to,
your
honor.
i'm
referring
to
the
fact
that
mr.
mezei
conducted
himself
in
such
a
way
to
raise
suspicion,
as
if
he
were,
say,
a
spy
for
the
soviet
union.
that's
the
national
security
issue
that
i'm
referring
to.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
think
i'll
reserve
time
for
rebuttal.
