justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
courts
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
respondent,
tennessee
secondary
school
athletic
association
is
a
not-for-profit
athletic
association
that
regulates
interscholastic
sport
among
tennessee
public
and
private
high
schools.
the
association
sets
membership
standards
and
student
eligibility
rules
and
has
the
power
to
penalize
any
member
school
that
violates
those
rules.
most
of
the
state’s
public
high
schools
rather
are
members
and
public
school
officials
make
up
the
voting
membership
of
the
association’s,
governing
council
and
control
board,
which
typically
hold
meetings
during
regular
school
hours.
the
state
board
of
education
has
long
acknowledged
the
association’s
role
in
regulating
interscholastic
competition
in
public
schools
and
its
designees
sit
as
nonvoting
members
of
the
association’s
governing
bodies.
when
the
association
penalized
the
petitioner,
brentwood
academy
for
violating
a
recruiting
rule,
brentwood
sued
the
association
and
its
executive
director
under
42
u.s.c.
1983,
claiming
that
the
rule’s
enforcement
was
state
action
that
violated
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
the
district
court
granted
brentwood
summary
judgment,
but
the
sixth
circuit
found
no
state
action
and
reversed.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
sixth
circuit,
and
hold
that
the
association’s
regulatory
activity
is
state
action
owing
to
the
pervasive
entwinement
of
public
school
officials
in
its
structure,
there
being
no
offsetting
reason
to
see
the
association’s
act
in
any
other
way.
no
one
fact
is
a
necessary
condition
for
finding
state
action;
nor
is
anyone
set
of
circumstances
sufficient
as
a
matter
of
law
for
there
may
always
be
some
countervailing
reason
against
attributing
activity
to
the
government.
in
this
case
however,
the
association’s
nominally
private
character
is
overborne
by
the
substantial
entwinement
of
public
institutions
and
public
officials
in
its
composition
and
its
working.
the
association
is
to
the
extent
of
84%
of
its
membership
in
an
organization
of
public
schools,
represented
by
their
officials
acting
in
an
official
capacity
to
provide
an
integral
element
of
secondary
public
education
interscholastic
athletics.
there
would
be
no
recognizable
association
without
the
public
school
officials,
who
overwhelmingly
determine
and
perform
all
but
the
association’s
purely
ministerial
acts.
only
the
16%
minority
of
private
school
memberships
keeps
the
entwinement
of
the
association
and
public
schools
from
being
total
and
their
identity
is
totally
indistinguishable.
to
complement
the
entwinement
from
the
bottom
up,
the
state
has
provided
entwinement
from
the
top
down.
state
board
members
sit
on
the
association’s
governing
bodies
and
association
employees
participate
in
the
state
retirement
system.
in
the
absence
of
any
substantial
reason
to
claim
unfairness
in
charging
the
association
with
a
public
character,
entwinement
to
the
degree
shown
here
requires
that
it
would
be
judged
by
constitutional
standards.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
scalia
and
justice
kennedy
joined.
