unknown
speaker
mr.
blumstein,
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
went
through
three
different
tests
that
they
thought
our
cases
support,
a
public
function,
state
compulsion,
symbiotic,
and
said
this
didn't
fit
into
any
one
of
those
three.
now,
do
you
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
those
points,
or
do
you
think
we
should
simply
expand
the
state
action
concept?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
state
what
you
think
the
test
is,
without
being
so
fact-specific?
what's
the
test
for
state
action,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
not
in
this
case,
in
all
cases.
what's
the
test?
unknown
speaker
wait,
let's...
it's
controlled
by
public
schools.
you
say
that
because
a
majority
of
its
board
are
public
school
principals?
unknown
speaker
of...
well,
of
its...
but
principally
its
governing
board.
it
wouldn't
matter
if
its
members,
if
its
governing
board,
i
assume,
were
overwhelmingly
governmental
you'd
say
it's
still
a
governmental
agency.
unknown
speaker
oh.
you're
relying
on
the
membership,
not...
i
thought
you
were
relying
on
the
control.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
so
if
this
organization
were
composed
of
49
percent
public
school...
public
schools
and
51
percent
private
schools,
it
would
be
okay?
unknown
speaker
but
in
the
washington
airport
case
it
was
the
government
which
said
the
decisionmakers
here
shall
be
ex
officio
members
of
certain
committees.
it
was
the
government
that
said
that.
here
it
is
not
the
government,
it
is
the
organization
which
has
a
rule
that
you
have
to
be
a
principal
to
be...
to
serve
on
the
governing
board,
and
it
is
the
organization,
certainly
not
the
government,
that
says,
you
know,
what
schools
will
be
a
member,
members
of
the
organization.
it
seems
to
me
that's
very
different
from--
unknown
speaker
--well,
mr.
blumstein,
supposing
that
all
the
principals,
say
in
eastern
tennessee,
or
middle
tennessee,
some
area,
got
together,
private
schools,
public
schools,
and
said
we
want
to
form
a
principals
association
and
get
together
once
a
month
and
we'll
have
a
convention
in
the
summertime,
and
they
don't
get
paid,
they
do
it
on
their
own
time,
and
they
decide
they're
going
to
give
a
principals'
award
to
the
best
student
in
eastern
tennessee,
and
they
give
that
award.
now,
is
that
state
action?
unknown
speaker
well,
my
hypothesis
was
that
the
principals
did
it
on
their
own
time.
they're
in
the
organization
because
they're
a
principal
of
a
school,
but
the
government
isn't
paying
their
way,
and
they're
not
exercising
any
state
power,
really,
when
they
do
this.
they're
just
conceiving
this
award
on
their
own
and
they're
giving
it
away.
unknown
speaker
you
could
have
had
the
same
rule
in
the
hypothetical
that
the
chief
justice
posed.
would
that
rule
have
changed
your
answer
to
that
question?
unknown
speaker
that
sure
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
establish
whether
the
principal
is
serving
as
an
agent
of
the
government
or
is
serving
on
his
own.
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
crucial
question.
unknown
speaker
well
now,
that's
a
different
question.
i
mean,
you
have
a
remedy
there.
i
assume
that
there
could
be
a
constitutional
violation
in
a
government
turning
over
its
determination
of
who
will
play
in
intramural
sports
to
an
organization
that
is
not
providing
due
process,
or
to
an
organization
that
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
race,
but
that's
not
the
argument
that
you're
making
here,
that
it's
improper
for
the
schools
to
deal
with
this
organization.
you're
saying
this
organization
itself
is
the
state.
unknown
speaker
and
it
hasn't--
--you
say
the
control
is
by
governmental
institution,
and
the
principal
of
the
school
goes
to
this...
sits
on
this
board,
or
belongs
to
the...
by
reason
of
the
fact
he's
a
principal.
what
other
control
does
the
school
he
comes
from
exercise
over
him?
unknown
speaker
yes,
or
over
his
vote
in
the
association.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
does
the
record
show?
unknown
speaker
how...
why
do
you
say
that?
unknown
speaker
and...
but
the
fact
that
the
principals
are
joined
in
the
organization
by
private
school
principals
too
makes
no
difference?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
you
say
they
control
the
organization.
i...
every
issue
isn't
brought
to
the
whole
body.
i
mean,
do
they
assemble
all
of
the
principals?
i
thought
this
was
run
by
a
governing
board,
and
your
complaint
is
that
the
governing
board
is
what,
elected
by
all
the
principals,
which
come
from
mostly
public
schools?
unknown
speaker
well,
excuse
me,
which
is
adopted
by
the
body
how?
how
does
the
body
adopt
that
rule?
unknown
speaker
okay.
that
is
done
on
a
floor
vote?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
to...
if
you're
a
school
that
plays
in
this
league,
do
you
have
to
send
somebody
to
this
organization
to
vote
on
such
things
as
this
rule
that
you're
objecting
to?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
duty
to
have
a
person
there
on
the
floor?
unknown
speaker
so...
and
although
being
a
principal
is
a
condition
of
being
a
member,
a
voting
member,
can
a
principal
decide,
i'm
not
interested
in
this
and
i
won't
do
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
not
to
participate
in
the
organization.
unknown
speaker
mr.
blumstein,
isn't
a
question
of
not
simply
control,
but
control
over
what?
for
example,
returning
to
the
chief's
hypothetical,
if
this
were
a
group
of
principals
meeting
not
to
make
an
award
to
a
student
for
diligence,
but
were
meeting
to
set
the
curriculum
that
would
be
used
in
all
the
schools
within
the
association.
if
that's
what
the
purpose
of
the
principals'
meeting,
and
what
they
decided
became
the
curriculum
for
the
school--
unknown
speaker
--so
you
would
say
it's
just
like
if
they
were
having
a
body
that
would
decide
what
will
be
taught
in
the
math
courses
in
the
schools.
unknown
speaker
in
this
case
i
suppose
it
follows
from
your
argument
that
all
of
the
rules
and
regulations
that
are
promulgated
by
the
association
are
promulgated
by
a
state
entity,
correct?
unknown
speaker
these
are
just
like...
there
are...
all
rules
and
regulations
they
pronounce
after...
if
you
prevail
will
be
state
rules.
unknown
speaker
are
there
parochial
schools
that
are
members
of
this
association?
unknown
speaker
and
so
the
result
would
be
that
all
rules
and
regulations
must
be
governed
by
the
first
amendment,
no
crucifixes
in
the
locker
room.
that
would
be
a
permissible
regulation.
unknown
speaker
under
your
view,
all
of
the
rules
and
regulations
are
now
the
rules
of
the
state
actor,
and
parochial
schools
are
members
of
this
body.
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
agree
that
the...
even
if
two
parochial
schools
were
playing
each
other?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
we
could
say
the
same
thing
about
brentwood
academy.
you
can
just
withdraw
from
the
association
if
you
don't
like
it.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
just
said
that
was
your
position
with
reference
to
the
parochial
schools.
unknown
speaker
you're
not
arguing
that
the
parochial
school
would
be
a
state
actor?
unknown
speaker
no,
okay.
unknown
speaker
and
you're
not
claiming...
you
don't
concede
that
in
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical
that
the
prayer
rule
would
be
unconstitutional,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
you're
saying
this
is
unconstitutional,
and
as
a
member
of
the
association
you
have
a
right
to
object
to
it
because
the
association
has
a
public
character.
unknown
speaker
you're
not
discussing
the
merits,
whether
the
first
amendment
gives
brentwood
a
right
to
recruit
outside
the
rules?
unknown
speaker
very
well.
ms.
underwood,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
what
if
it
admitted
a
huge
number
of
private
school
members?
unknown
speaker
well,
assume...
let's
assume
that
it
performs
the
same
function
that
is
being
performed
here
in
regulating
public
school
contests.
would
you
say
that
that
was
a
factor
that
ought
to
be
considered,
even
though
the
membership
was
predominantly
private?
unknown
speaker
sure.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
one
of
the
things
you'd
look
to?
unknown
speaker
and
it
would
be
the
case,
i
take
it,
any
state
athletic
association,
given
the
current
mix
of
public
and
private
schools.
unknown
speaker
i
wanted
to
see
the
cases
you
thought
most
applicable,
and
in
your
brief
at
page
8
you
cite
the
gerard
college
case,
evans
and
newton,
and
lebron.
i
think
lebron
is
not
so
much
in
point
because
there
was
a
lot
of
top-down
governmental
delegation
there
that
is
different
than
in
this
case,
precise
delegation
from
the
legislature,
pennsylvania
and
evans,
much
closer.
in
those
cases,
as
i
recall,
the
public
trustees
were
voting
in
their
public
capacity.
is
it
clear
that
that's
happening
here
as
well,
to
you?
unknown
speaker
sure.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
rules
were
changed
so
that
to
be
a
delegate
you
didn't
have
to
be
a
principal,
that
you
were
just
a
parent
from
the
school
in
question,
so
there's
a
representative
from
each
one
of
the
schools?
unknown
speaker
i
know
it
would.
unknown
speaker
i
know
it
would,
but
would
it...
would
that
still
be--
unknown
speaker
--state
action?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
so
this
hinges
on
whether
the
principals
take
directions
from
the
school.
is
there
any
indication
that
the
principals
act
in
anything
other
than
their
own
best--
unknown
speaker
--is
that
conceded,
that
the
principals
could
be
instructed
to
vote
a
certain
way
in
this
organization?
unknown
speaker
who
instructs
principals?
i
thought
the
principals
instruct
the
other
people
in
the
schools.
unknown
speaker
oh,
but
do
you
think
the
board
of
education
is
apt
to
tell
a
principal
what
to
do
when
he
goes
to
these
meetings?
i
mean,
is
there
any
finding
in
the
first
place?
unknown
speaker
that
ceased,
did
it
not,
the
review?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
question
that
if
the
state
board
did,
in
fact,
instruct
the
principals
by
passing
a
general
standard
that
would
be
applicable
to
these
athletic
contests
that
the
principals
would
be
bound
to
follow
the
state
board's
rule?
for
example,
a
state
board
says,
no
athlete
will
be
allowed
to
play
in
intramural
games
who
is
found
drinking
beer
within
a
month
of
the
game.
i
mean,
would
a
principal
be
free
to
disregard
that?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
a
line
can
be
drawn
between
german
and
sports?
unknown
speaker
perhaps
i
should
have
asked
the
question
of
petitioner,
but
his
time
was
running
out,
as
yours
is.
on
page
8
of
the
blue
brief,
the
first
full
paragraph
says
that
for
a
school
to
be
a
member,
its
coach
must
be
a
full-time
employee
of
the
board
of
education.
does
brentwood's
coach
have
to
be
a
full-time
employee
of
the
board
of
education,
as
you
understand
it?
unknown
speaker
because
it
seems
to
me
that
would
have
certainly
a
bearing
on
the
case.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
underwood.
mr.
colbert,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
suppose
all
of
the
schools
in
the
association
were
public
schools.
suppose
everything
is
the
same,
except
that
the
organization
is
only
for
public
schools,
and
only
public
schools
compete
in
these
competitions.
would
your
answer
be
the
same?
based
on
what
you
just
said,
i
take
it
it
would
be.
it
still
wouldn't
be
a
state
actor,
even
if
it
regulated
only
public
schools.
unknown
speaker
the
students
get
some
credit
for
physical
education,
toward
that
requirement,
from
being
on
this
varsity
team?
unknown
speaker
but
why
wouldn't
the
principal,
when
he
or
she
goes
to
the
meeting
and
casts
a
vote,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
principal,
when
he
or
she
casts
a
vote,
must
be
acting
in
a
state
capacity
because
that's
why
that
principal
is
there.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
record
doesn't
tell
us,
but
it's
just
incredible
to
me
that
the
principal
would
not
be
accountable
to
the
board
of
education
for
the
principal's
actions
in
voting.
unknown
speaker
and
it
seems
to
me
somewhat
unlike
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical
of
a
principals'
association,
because
the
principal
is
there
in
order
to
advance
the
interests
of
the
school
as
a
school.
unknown
speaker
so
in
your
view
the
principal
would
be
quite
unconstrained
by
the
constitution
from
voting
to
deny
membership
to
a
school
because
its
athletes
were
black,
or
catholic,
or
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
except
that's
the
only
reason
he's
there,
is
because
he
is
the
principal.
unknown
speaker
is
it
theoretically
possible
that
the
legislative
council
could
be...
which
enacts
the
rules
could
be
composed
of
a
majority
of
private
school
principals?
unknown
speaker
mr.
colbert,
you
told
me,
and
i
think
you
were
quite
candid
in
this,
that
it
doesn't
matter,
that
you
would
be
arguing
the
very
same
thing
if
this
were
an
association
where
the
members
were
all
public
schools--
unknown
speaker
--and
it
excluded
private
schools.
unknown
speaker
your
argument
would
be
identical
to
what
it
is.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
surely
more
hypothetical
than
real,
because
at
least
for
this
board,
and
every
other
similar
state
association
that
we've
ever
heard
of
either
has
either
all
public
school
on
its
board
or
overwhelming
majority.
that's
in...
how
these
things
operate
in
the
real
world.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
they
might
change,
as
counsel
for
the
government
told
us,
if
there
were
a
different
mix
of
school
at
some
future
time,
but
right
now,
these
leagues
are
overwhelmingly
public.
unknown
speaker
no.
i
think
you've
clarified
that,
that
if
you're
dealing
with
a
universe
that's
all
public
schools,
your
argument
is
still
the
same,
no
state
action.
unknown
speaker
in
that
case
the
court
seemed
to
be
impressed
by
the
fact
that
it
wasn't...
any
one
state
could
never
have
control
of
that
organization.
you
couldn't
belong
to
one
state,
because
it
covered
all
the
states.
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
tell
us
if
there
are
any
private,
substantially
equivalent
league
which
is...
well,
any
league
which
is
made
up
of
all
private
schools
which
is
substantially
equivalent?
unknown
speaker
in
the
state
of
tennessee?
unknown
speaker
while
i've
got
you
on
the
facts,
is
it
correct
where
the
blue
brief
says
at
page
8
that
for
a
school
to
be
a
member
its
coach
must
be
a
full-time
employee
of
the
board
of
education?
unknown
speaker
is
brentwood's
coach
a
full-time
member
of
the
board
of
education?
unknown
speaker
full-time
employee.
unknown
speaker
just
in
the
public
school
context?
unknown
speaker
so
it...
but
it
wouldn't
rule
out
a
part-time
coach,
i
take
it,
so
long
as
the
part-time
coach
was
an
employee
rather
than
an
independent
contractor?
unknown
speaker
but
the
main
coach,
even
in
the
private
school,
would
have
to
be
a
full-time
employee?
because
the
rule
as
quoted
on
page
8
says,
have
a
tennessee
state
teacher's
license,
be
a
full-time
employee.
how
does
it
work
now
for
the
private
schools,
for
the
main
coach,
not
the
assistant
coach?
must
the
main
coach
be
a
full-time
employee
of
brentwood
under
these
rules?
unknown
speaker
so
that
this
rule,
to
the
extent
that
it
requires
a
full-time
employee,
does
apply
to
private
schools
as
well.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
it
does
in
other
respects.
that
is,
full-time
employee--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
may
i
ask
whether
you
think
your
client
was
a
state
actor
before...
1995,
was
it,
they
changed
the
rules?
unknown
speaker
1996.
unknown
speaker
but
there's
something
really
different
about
that
rendell-baker
and...
and
here,
it's
a
public
official
being
paid
by
the
state,
goes
to
meetings.
it's
not
out
of
his
own
pocket,
is
it,
the
principal,
when
he
goes
to
the
board
it's
on
state
time,
or
municipal
time,
whoever
hires
him?
unknown
speaker
is
the
principal
expected,
out
of
his
private
purse,
to
fund
his
participation
in
this
organization?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
what
the
practice,
the
custom
or
practice
is?
unknown
speaker
could
the
state
board
of
education,
if
it
so
chose,
say
we're
no
longer
going
to
rely
in
any
sense
upon
this
organization,
and
we
ourselves
will
set
the
rules
for
intramural
contests?
would
it
have
the
authority
legally
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
so
that
what
this
organization,
then,
is
doing
in
effect
is
filling
the
vacuum
created
by
the
choice
of
the
state
board
of
education
not
to
regulate.
unknown
speaker
but
it
could...
if
it
were
the
regulator
in
the
first
instance
it,
i
presume,
would
have
the
authority
to
say
that
no
public
school
may
engage
in
an
interscholastic
contest
with
a
private
school
unless
these
rules
are
observed.
that
would
be
within
its
authority,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
in
jackson
v.
metropolitan
edison
the
pennsylvania
legislature
could
have
legislated
and
controlled
what
metropolitan
edison
did.
unknown
speaker
isn't
there
a
difference...
and
maybe
there
isn't
historically
in
tennessee,
but
isn't
there
a
difference
in
the
fact
that
intramural
athletic
contests
are
sort
of
accepted
as
a
standard
part
of
the
educational
scheme,
whereas
state
provision
of
electric
power
is
not?
is
that
a
fair
distinction?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
but
since
1925,
i
take
it,
it
has
been
the
common
practice
of
the
schools
in
tennessee
to
engage
in
interscholastic
athletic
contests.
unknown
speaker
but
nobody
in
tennessee
would
say,
when
they
heard
that
the
x
school
was
having...
was
engaging
in
interscholastic
athletics,
no
one
in
tennessee
would
say,
what
are
they
doing
that
for,
that's
crazy
for
a
school
to
be
doing
that.
unknown
speaker
they
think
it's
crazy
to
swim
in
tennessee?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
souter's
from
new
england.
[laughter]
different
mores.
unknown
speaker
yes,
what
have
they
got
against
hockey?
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
the
basic
point
is,
schools
customarily
play
each
other
in
tennessee.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
there
was
a
finding
in...
that
the
principals
who
attend
these
meetings
are
customarily
reimbursed.
unknown
speaker
do
you
dispute
that
as
a
matter
of
fact?
unknown
speaker
on
the
other
hand,
if
your
position
is
right,
then
this
association,
where
most
of
the
members
are
public
school
principals,
can
decide
as
far
as
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
concerned,
we
don't
want
to
have
any
teams
for
girls.
we're
going
to
limit
our
varsity
teams
to
boys.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
that
association
could
impose
that
rule
on
brentwood.
it
could
say,
brentwood,
if
you
want
to
be
a
member
of
our
association
you
can't
let
women
participate
in
intercollegiate
sports,
or
interscholastic
sports.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
people
who
have
made
up
that
rule
are
the
very
same
principals
of
the
schools
that
would
be
sued
individually?
unknown
speaker
and
even
though
they're
appearing
in
that
body
as
a
representative
of
their
school,
not
as
an
individual?
unknown
speaker
oh,
but
that's
not
right.
i
don't
think
there's
any
claim
that
brentwood
is
a
state
actor,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
no,
you're
just
allowing
it
to
say
that
the
rules
that
the
association
imposes
on
its
members
are
a
state
action.
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
individual
school...
the...
if
brentwood
complied
with
those
rules
it
would
not
be
a
state
actor.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's
one
of
the
issues.
unknown
speaker
well,
surely
it's
not
a
matter
of
private
choice
whether
a
public
school
chooses
to
join
the
association
or
not.
i
mean,
the
decision
to
join
the
association
has
to
be
a...
you
don't
acknowledge
that
that
decision
is
an
official
public
school
decision?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
a
decision
to
join.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
colbert.
mr.
blumstein,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
