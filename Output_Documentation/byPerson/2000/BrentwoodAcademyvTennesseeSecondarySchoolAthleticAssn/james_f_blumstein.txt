mr.
james
f.
blumstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
state
action
status
of
the
regulatory
conduct
of
a
high
school
athletic
association,
the
respondent,
the
tennessee
secondary
school
athletic
association,
or
what
we
call
the
tssaa.
under
the
analysis
of
this
court's
decision
in
ncaa
v.
tarkanian,
state
action
exists
in
this
case
because
first,
the
regulatory
conduct
of
the
tssaa
is
attributable
to
the
entity
or
entities
that
control
the
organization
and,
secondly,
government
institutions,
in
this
case
public
schools,
control
the
tssaa's
conduct
and
are
therefore
constitutionally
accountable
for
its
regulatory
conduct.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
mr.
chief
justice,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
look
at
the
local
level
interactions
between
the
tssaa
and
the
public
schools.
it
looked
exclusively
at
the
state-level
relationships,
and
so
we
think
it
overlooked
the
core
ingredients
of
the
tarkanian
analysis.
it
was
the
local-level
interconnections.
there
are
two
levels
of
state
interaction
with
the
tssaa.
at
the
state
level,
the
state
board
of
education
for
24
years
explicitly
designated
this
organization
as
its
agent
to
regulate
interscholastic
athletics
for
all
schools
in
tennessee.
that
was
repealed,
or
changed
in
1996,
and
now
it
recognizes,
continues
to
recognize
the
role
of
the
tssaa
and
specifically
authorizes
the
schools
to
maintain
their
membership
in
the
tssaa
and
the
court
of
appeals
focused
exclusively
on
that
state-level
relationship.
under
the
tarkanian
analysis,
your
honor,
the
local
levels,
the
public
schools
that
control
this
organization,
that
comprise
84
percent
of
the
membership,
where
there's
one
school,
one
vote,
control
the
organization
and
under
the
tarkanian
analysis
we
think
the--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--justice
o'connor,
in
this
case,
building
on
the--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--well,
whether
the...
in
this
case
whether
the
governmental
institutions,
in
this
case
public
schools,
control
the
activity
and
so
that
it
is
fair
to
say
that
this
is
attributable
to
the
government
because
the
government,
or
its
public
schools
in
this
case,
control
the
decisionmaking.
this
is...
case
is
unlike
many
of
this
court's
other
cases,
such
as
rendell-baker
v.
kohn,
involving
a
school,
blum
v.
yaretsky,
involving
a
nursing
home,
jackson
v.
metropolitan
edison,
involving
a
private
utility.
in
all
of
those
circumstances,
justice
o'connor,
the
privateness,
if
you
will,
the
formal
privateness
of
the
organization
was
assumed,
and
the
question
was
whether
the
government
as
purchaser,
or
government
as
regulator,
transformed
that
private,
concededly
private
entity
into
state
actor
status.
in
this
case,
that
very
threshold
question
is
what
is
at
stake.
there
is
nothing
really
private,
except
formally
private,
about
this
organization.
it
is
controlled
by
public
schools,
84
percent
of
the
membership
is
public
schools,
it's
run
by
public--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--of
its
members,
justice
scalia.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
well,
i
think
that
under
the
control
principle--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--on
the
composition.
we
think
both
are
important,
but
it's--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--ultimately
the
control
of
the
organization
in
a
one-school,
one-vote
situation
is
the
membership
of
the
organization.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
justice
scalia,
we
think
there's
an
analogy
to
the
separation
of
powers
cases,
the
washington
metropolitan
airports
case,
and
bowsher
v.
synar
and
the
question
of
control...
there's
an
effective
control
question
and
a
formal
control
question.
we're
not
anywhere
close
to
the
effective
control
question
here.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
but
it
is
the
organization
that's
controlled
by
governmental
institutions,
so--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--your
honor,
if
the
organization...
if
they're
serving
in
their
official
capacity
as
principals,
if
they're
representing
the
schools,
and
if
they
are
allowing
private
and
public
schools
to
participate
in
some
awarding
process,
whether
it
be
a
principals'
association
or
a
german
club,
if
the
german
departments
of
the
state
decided
that
they--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--your
honor,
as
one
moves
towards
the...
a
coaches'
association
or
principals'
association,
i
concede
that
it
is
conceivable
that
public
officials
will
have
a
nonpublic
function,
or
nongovernmental
function
that
they
can
perform,
and
they
would
not
be
state
actors.
i
think
in
this
case
the
public
officials
are
serving
because
of
their
relationship
to
the
school,
because
they
are
the
principals
in
the
school,
and
the
clearest
example
of
that
is
in
the
constitutional
provision
of
the
tssaa
regarding
vacancies.
if
there
is
a
person
who
is
a
member
of
the
board
of
control,
or
a
member
of
the
legislative
council,
and
that
person's
school
disaffiliates
with
the
organization,
then
that
person's
term
of
office
on
the
board
of
control
or
the
legislative
council
terminates,
so
it
is
clear
that
these
persons
are
not
there
as
individuals,
but
there
as...
in
their
representative
capacity
of
the
schools
that
they
represent.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
well,
your
honor,
in
this
case--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--well,
i
agree,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
in
this
case,
as
the
government
argues
in
its
amicus
brief,
that
you
have
control
linked
with
a
functional
analysis
as
to
what
is
the
function
that
is
being
performed,
and
here
the
public
schools,
all
of
which
have
joined
this
organization,
so
that
if
you
want
to
play
a
game
against
a
public
school,
you
must
either
be
a
member
of
this
organization
or
you
must
get
game-by-game
written
approval
by
the
organization.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
well,
we're
saying
that
it's
controlled
by
governmental
institutions,
whether
formally
we
are...
we
want
to
argue,
following
the
court's
decision
in
lebron,
that
this
is
an
arm
of
the
state,
or
whether
we
want
to
provide
a
bright-line
rule
so
that
we
don't
have
to
traverse
this
difficult
area
of
state
action
in
every
case,
this
case
is
different
from
every
other
case
that
the
court
has
decided
in
this
regard
because
the
control
is
by
governmental
institutions,
and
the
organization
is
exercising
a
governmental
function.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
over
him?
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
well,
the--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--the
record
only
shows
that
the
vote
must...
can
only
be
done
by
a
principal
or
by
a
teacher
of
the
school
as
the
representative
of
the
school.
we
don't
know
exactly
how
control
is
exercised
within
the
institution
of
the
government,
but
this
person
is
acting
in
his
or
her
official--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--ex
officio.
because
the
schools
are
the
members
of
the
organization.
it's
not
the
officials.
it's
not
a
coaches'
association.
it's
not
an
association
of
principals.
this
is
an
association
of
schools,
of
public
schools
and
private
schools,
84
percent
public
schools.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
well,
the
control
in
this
case
is
with
the
schools
that
run
the
organization
and
i
think
under
the
circumstances
the
decision
is
fairly
attributable
to
the
state.
this
is
a
decision
that
public
schools
are
making.
they
control
the
organization,
they
drive
the
agenda,
and
that
they
have
control
over
the--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--there's
both
an
as-applied
and
a
facial
challenge.
the
facial
challenge
does
not
focus
upon
action
of
the
governing
board.
it
focuses
upon
the
recruiting
rule,
which
is
adopted
by
the
body.
then
there
is
the
implementation,
the
disciplinary
proceeding--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--in
a
one-school,
one-vote--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--yes,
and
the
as-applied
challenge
focuses
on
the
implementation,
the
disciplinary
proceeding,
and
that
requires
a
decision
at
first
by
the
executive
director,
and
then
it
was
appealed
through
the...
an
internal
procedure,
appeals
procedure,
ultimately
ending
up
at
the
board
of
control,
which
is
this
governing
body,
and
they
affirmed
the
decision
and
ultimately
the
disciplinary
action
was
taken
by
the
board
of
control,
which
was
composed
in
the
relevant
time
frame
of
100-percent
public
school
principals
serving
ex
officio
again.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
is
there
a
duty
to
vote?
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
i
don't
believe
that
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
not
to
participate
in--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--i
believe
the
school
can
exercise
its
right
not
to
vote
in
the
process,
but
they
have
ultimate
control
and
in
bowsher
v.
synar
we
were
told
that
it
is
the
ability
to
control,
not
how
the
control
is
exercised,
that
is
critical.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
there
has
to
be
a
mixture
of
the
control
and
also
an
analysis
of
the
function,
the
governmental
function
that
is
being
performed
and
in
this
case
you're
quite
correct,
if
it
were
a
curriculum
matter,
or
in
this
case
an
extracurricular
matter
that
this
court
in
the
santa
fe
case
talked
about
being
a
highly
visible,
government-sponsored
school-related
activity,
under
those
circumstances
the
allocation
of
this
resource,
the
ability
to
play
against
the
public
schools
in
sports,
is
the
public,
or
governmental
function
that
is
being
performed
in
this
case.
it's
part
of
the
overall
educational
process
of
the
state
of
tennessee,
and
it's
part
of
the
fabric
of
the
educational
institution,
and
in
the
santa
fe
case
this--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--well,
your
honor,
if
this...
if
the
lower
court
is
affirmed
in
this
case,
then
we
can
expect
to
have
associations
of
the
german
department
chairs,
and
of
the
history
department
chairs
and
so
forth,
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
right
in
this,
that
all
that
it
takes
is
a
formalistic
change
in
a
state-wide
rule,
then
we
can
see
delegation
and
privatization
i
think
of
many
other
areas
of
our
school
activity
and
noneducational
activity
as
well.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
from
the
tssaa,
your
honor?
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
if
those
rules--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--there
are
religious
schools
that
are
members
of
this
association.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
if
the...
i'm
sorry,
if
the
association
promulgated--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--yes,
your
honor,
the
parochial
schools
are
members
of
the
body,
and
if
the
organization,
the
tssaa
had
a
rule
that,
for
example,
banned
prayer
at
games
in
which
the
organizations
participated,
then
it
would
be...
the
rules
would
be
subject
to
constitutional
scrutiny.
the
rules
of
the
association
would
be
subject
to
constitutional
scrutiny.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
well,
under
the
tssaa
bylaws,
schools
do
not
have
the
authority
to
undo
these
rules.
they
are
bound
to
abide
by
the
rules,
and
the
rules
themselves
would...
i
think
would
be
subject
to
scrutiny.
if
a
religious
organization
is
uncomfortable
with
a
constraint
upon
its
religious
exercise,
then
it
has
the
ability
to
choose
not
to
play
against
the
public
schools.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
well,
that's
the
respondent's
position,
your
honor,
but
if
you
want
to
play
against
the
public
schools--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--yes,
your
honor,
but
it
wouldn't...
i'm
staying
with
the
state
actor
status.
it
would
be
a
state
actor,
and
i'm
trying
to
be
consistent
with
our
position
that
the
activity
of
the
association
as
controlled
by
these
governmental
institutions
would
be
subject
to
constitutional
scrutiny,
and
if--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--no.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
no,
no.
just
the
rules
of
the
association
are
subject--
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
--a
ban
on
prayer?
no.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
no.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
yes.
the...
whether
it
be
a
ban,
or
whatever
the
rule
would
be
that
would
be
promulgated
by
this
organization
would
be
subject
to
constitutional
scrutiny.
yes,
justice
souter,
that
is
our
position.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
we're
hoping
to
survive
to
live
another
day
to
fight
that
issue
in
the
lower
court.
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
some
time,
if
i
might.
mr.
james
f.
blumstein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
tssaa
has
been
very
candid
in
stating
the
breadth
of
its
position,
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
on
page
32
of
its
brief
their
position
seems
to
be
that
even
a
coach
who
is
a
public
school
teacher
and
a
public
school
official
is
not
a
state
actor,
so
their
position
is
that
extracurricular
activities
are
so
outside
of
the
scope
of
public
accountability
that
even
if
there
is
a
decision
by
a
coach
about
a
decision
affecting
athletic
contests,
that
that
does
not
fall
within
state
action.
the
other...
another
point
on
the
question
of
control,
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
89
and
page
92
it
makes
it
pretty
clear
that
the
principals
are
representatives
of
the
school
in
voting
on
the
legislative
council
and
on
the
board
of
control,
and
joint
appendix
89
and
92
sets
that
out.
and
finally,
i
would
like
to
just
indicate,
we
haven't
talked
about
the
existing
state
of
the
law,
but
this
circuit,
the
sixth
circuit
decision
is
the
only
decision
that
finds
a
comparable
institution
not
to
be
a
state
actor.
this
case
is
an
outlier
in
that
sense.
the
law
has
been
settled
for
over
30
years.
some
of
the
concerns
that
the
respondent
has
i
think
have
not
been
manifested.
the
way
that
the
courts
have
dealt
with
the
issue
of
reviewing
decisions
of
these
associations
is
through
a
proper
level
of
deference
on
a
matter
of
substantive
law,
and
so
if
the
court
affirms
below
it
will
be
unsettling
what
has
been
settled
law
in
every
jurisdiction
that
has
heard
this
case
for
30
years.
thank
you,
your
honor.
