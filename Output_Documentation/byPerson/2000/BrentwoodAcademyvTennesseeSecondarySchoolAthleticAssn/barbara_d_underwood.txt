ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
a
group
of
public
schools,
all
state
actors,
join
together
in
an
association
to
run
a
program
for
students,
that
association
is
a
state
actor,
too,
and
its
status
should
not
change
when
it
admits
a
relatively
small
number
of
private
school
members.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
if
the...
if
it
admitted...
if
the
membership
were
more
private
school
than
public
school,
it
would
cease
to
be
a
public
entity
on
the
theory
that
we're
advancing
here.
one
would
have
to
look
at
other
questions.
there
might
be
other
reasons
why
its
actions
should
be
attributed
to
the
state,
or
they
might
not
be.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
it
would
be
a
factor
that
ought
to
be
considered,
but
it
would
be
a
different
case
and
a
weaker
case,
and
perhaps
more
like--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--ncaa
v.--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--absolutely.
absolutely,
but
this
case
is
easier,
because
in
fact...
well,
tarkanian
held
that
an
association
of
mostly
private
colleges
from
many
states
did
not
acquire
state
actor
status
from
one
of
its
members,
the
member,
the
public
university
that
was
at
issue
in
that
case.
the
court
noted
that
the
case
would
be
different
if
the
members
were
largely
public
and
from
the
same
state,
and
that's
this
case.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
correct.
the
litigation
against...
involving
these
associations
in
many
states
across
the
country
where
the
record
shows
the
numbers,
shows
similar
numbers
to
this
case...
that
is,
80
percent,
or
85
percent
public,
the
world
could,
of
course,
change
and
then
the
issues
might
be
different,
but
that
is
the
case
in
tennessee
and,
as
far
as
the
cases
show,
everywhere
else
as
well.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
it
is
clear
that
that's
happening
here.
i
mean,
each
of
these
cases
is
slightly
different,
of
course.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
but
in
this
case
it
is
the
schools
that
are
members,
not
the
individual
coaches.
they
are
members
in
order
to
provide
a
program
for
their
students.
that's
what
schools
do.
that's
their
general
public
function,
and
this
is
a
piece
of
that
function,
and
they
represent
their
schools.
so
that
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
no
other
capacity
in
which
they
could
be
acting
than
in
their
public
capacity
as
officials
of
their...
of
the
public
schools.
that
is,
the
public
school
members.
obviously,
the
private
school
members
are
representing
their
private
schools,
but
they
are
a
very
small
minority.
and
on
the
question
whether
it's
the
board
or
the
membership
that's
important
here,
it
seems
to
me...
and
membership
isn't
entirely
the
right
way
to
describe
it.
these
are
voting
members.
they
choose
their
board,
and
they
can
remove
their
board
members,
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
it
is
the
membership.
it
happens
that
it's
not
surprising
that
this
membership
has
chosen
governing
boards
that
are
either
exclusively
or
overwhelmingly
composed
of
public
members,
but--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
that
would
be
a
different
sort
of
association.
it
would
be
less
clear.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
it
would
be
less--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--it
would
be
like--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--it
would
depend
on
what
that
parent's
responsibility
was.
it
would
be
less...
i
understand
your
hypothetical
to
say
that
that
parent
does
not
take
direction,
or
cannot
be
directed
by
the
school
in
the
way--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--the
school
employee
does,
and
so
i
think
it
would
be
less
clear
to
say
then
that
the
schools
control
the
organization.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
i
don't
think
it
hinges
on
whether
they
in
fact
do.
it
hinges
on
the
fact
that
the
schools
and,
indeed,
in
this
case
ultimately
the
state
legislature
and
the
state
board
of
education
to
whom
the
schools
are
accountable
have
the
capacity
to
give
them
direction,
that
they
act
in
their
official
capacity,
and
whether
they
in
fact
give
direction
as
to
any
particular
decision
or
not
is
not
the
point.
the
point
is
that
they
have
the
ability
to
do
so.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
i
don't
believe
the
issue
was
squarely
joined,
but
they
are
school
officials,
and
the
schools
are
members,
and--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--they
do,
but
ultimately
a
principal
of
a
public
school
is
accountable
to
a
board
of
education,
and
ultimately
to
the
state
board
of
education
or
to
the
legislature.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
the
record
establishes
that
the
state
board
of
education
so
recognized
the
important
role
of
this
association
in
the
provision
of
educational
activities
to
its
students
that
it
has
sent
members
ex
officio
to
the
board
meetings,
and
it
has
reserved...
over
an
extensive
period
of
time
it
reserved
the
right
to
review
the
rules
of
the
association,
so
i
think--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
actually
the
district
judge
found
that
nothing
changed
when
the
regulation
changed,
so
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
that
ceased.
it
is
true
that
the
state
board
of
education
revised
the
regulation
that
it
had
that
expressly
reserved
the
right
to
review
the
rules.
it
isn't
clear
that
they
stopped
reviewing
the
rules
at
all.
in
fact--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--i
don't
think
he
would,
but
if,
under
the
particular
structure
of
education
in
tennessee
he
might
be,
then
it
is
surely
within
the
power
of
the
tennessee
legislature
to
arrange
things
to
give
the
board
that
power.
that
is,
i
don't
know
whether
the
board
currently
has
that
power,
although
i
would
assume
so.
if
it
doesn't,
tennessee,
as
a
state,
in
some
capacity
certainly
does
have
the
power
to
instruct...
to
direct
the
conduct
of
public
education
in
tennessee,
including
the
rules
that
govern
interscholastic
athletics.
if
this
association
is
not
a
state
actor,
then
a
gap
will
open
up
in
the
constitutional
coverage
of
public
school
programs,
because
schools
may
often
collaborate
in
providing
programs
for
their
students,
not
only
in
athletics
but
also,
for
example,
in
language
and
travel
and
music
and
art,
in
devising
and
administering
standardized
tests,
and
that
collaboration
should
not
shelter
the
programs
from
constitutional
accountability.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
i
do
think
a
line
can
be
drawn,
but
in
fact
both
the
tennessee
board
of
education
and
boards
of
education
in
general
have
regarded
sports
as
part
of
the
educational
program.
they
wouldn't
have
to
do
so,
but
they
have
done
so
here,
and
have
typically
done
so,
and
it's
not...
it
was
suggested
that
it
would
be
sufficient
to
hold
each
public
school
accountable,
but
in
fact
the
individual
public
schools
have
no
power
one
by
one
to
change
the
rules
or
the
actions
of
the
association.
together
they
control
it,
but
alone
no
one
of
them
does,
so
unless
the
association
itself
is
regarded
as
a
public
actor
because
it
is
the...
an
aggregate
of
public
actors,
then
collective
action
by
the
association
could
escape
constitutional
review.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
that's
my
understanding
of
the
rules,
but
i'm
really
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
that.
perhaps
brentwood--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--i
think
that's
correct.
