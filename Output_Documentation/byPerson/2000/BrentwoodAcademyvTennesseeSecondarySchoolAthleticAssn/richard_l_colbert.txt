mr.
richard
l.
colbert
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
tssaa's
authority
to
enforce
rules
for
high
school
sports
competition
comes
from
the
private
choice
of
the
schools
that
join
tssaa
to
abide
by
those
rules
and
not
from
any
authority
given
to
tssaa
by
the
state
of
tennessee,
and
whether
the
court
examines
the
case
as
the
sixth
circuit
did,
using
jackson,
and
blum,
and
rendell-baker,
and
the
u.s.
olympic
committee
case,
and
tarkanian,
and
sullivan,
the
result
is
the
same.
the
question
is,
where
does
the
authority
for
the
power
exercised
by
the
association
come
from,
and
in
this
case
it
is
quite
clear
in
brentwood
academy's
case
and
in
the
case
of
the
other
member
schools,
it
comes
from
the
decision,
school-by-school,
which
each
school
is
given
the
choice
to
make
under
state
law,
of
joining
the
association
and
abiding
by
those
rules.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
my
answer
would
be
the
same,
your
honor.
it
would
not
be
a
state
actor
because
it
is
engaging
in
a
function
that
is
not
a
function
that
the
state
of
tennessee
has
chosen
to
regulate
by
statute
or
by
constitution.
the
function
involved
is
an
extracurricular
activity,
high
school
sports
competition.
like
band
competition,
cheerleading,
art
competition,
forensics--
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
--there
is
a
statute,
the
only
statute
in
tennessee
that
addresses
interscholastic
athletics
at
all
allows
a
local
public
school
board,
if
it
chooses,
to
give
credit
for
participation
in
interscholastic
sports
or
band,
either
one,
to
allow
that
in
lieu
of
physical,
the
required
physical
education
classes,
but
tennessee
does
not
regulate,
the
state
does
not
regulate,
the
state
says
nothing
about,
in
legislation,
how
interscholastic
sports
competitions
from
one
school
to
the
next
will
be
conducted.
now,
i
would
agree,
your
honor,
that
any
individual
school
would
be
a
state
actor
in
the
decisions
that
school
makes
for
its
own
athletic
program,
but
the
school,
the
principal
of
school
a
has
no
authority
from
the
state
of
tennessee
to
regulate
school
b's
athletic
programs.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
the
principal
is
actually
there
in
a
capacity...
and
i
need
to
clarify
this,
because
i
think
there
was
a
misstatement
made
about
how
the
rules
get
adopted.
the
membership
at
large
does
not
adopt
the
rules,
and
this
is
in
the...
part
of
the
tssaa
constitution
is
in
the
appendix.
there's
a
separate
body.
there's
a
board
of
control
that
enforces
the
rules.
there's
a
legislative
council
that
enacts
the
rules.
it's
also
a
nine-member
representative
body.
the
principals
who
are
there,
voting,
who
are
on
that
body,
are
serving
in
a
representative
capacity.
they
have
been
elected
by
the
member
schools,
both
public
and
private,
to
serve
in
a
representative
capacity
on
that
board.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
well,
the--
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
--the
principal
is
there
on
the
legislative
council
or
on
the
board
of
control
in
order
to
advance
the
interests
of
the
voters
who
elected
him
and
represent...
to
serve
in
a
representative
capacity
on
the
legislative
council.
that
may
be
public
schools--
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
--the
principal
as
a
representative,
as
a
representative
of
brentwood
academy
and
any
other
school
who
elected
him,
would
not
be
accountable
constitutionally
for
that.
now,
if
the
principal
of
a
public
school
does
not
allow
his
school
to
participate,
refuses
to
schedule
a
contest
against
a
school
because
of...
for
unconstitutional
reasons,
then
he,
as
the
principal
of
his
school,
makes
his
school
accountable
for
that,
but
he
is
not
acting
as
the
principal
of
his
school
when
he
serves
on
the
board
of
control
or
the
legislative
council.
he's
eligible
to
be
on
the
board
or
the
council
because
he
is
a
principal
of
a
member
school,
just
like
the
headmaster
of
brentwood
academy
is
eligible.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
he...
well,
he
is
there
to
further
the
interests
of
the
entire
association,
which
includes
the
public
and
private
school
members
as
well.
he
is
eligible
to
be
there
because
he
is
a
principal.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
it's
entirely
possible,
your
honor.
it's
strictly
a
function
of
which
principals
decide
to
run
for
the
body
and
which
principals
are
elected
to
serve
on
the
body,
and
there
have
been
private
school
principals
or
headmasters
who
have
served
on
one
body
or
the
other,
so
it's...
you
could
have...
even
though,
because
in
the
state
of
tennessee,
as
in
any
other
state
at
the
secondary
level,
there
are
more
public
schools
than
there
are
private
schools,
there
are
going
to
be
more
public
schools
engaged
in
extracurricular
activities
than
there
are
private
schools.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
right.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
right.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
that's
right.
that's
right,
and
i'm...
simply,
in
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question,
you
could
have
an
association
that
has
86
percent
public
school
membership,
as
tssaa
does,
and
have
the
entire
board
of
control
consist
of
private
school--
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
--that's
because
there
are
more
of
them
and
they're
more--
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
--and
they're
more
likely
to
run.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
but
your
honor,
i
don't
know
that
a
different
mix
of
schools
would
necessarily
make
a
difference
in
the
governing
body.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
well,
if
you...
and
in
the
tarkanian
case,
for
example,
you
were
dealing
with
a
universe
of,
as
reflected
in
the
argument
transcript,
roughly
1,000
schools,
a
roughly
even
split
between
public
and
private
schools,
but
you
had
a
committee
on
infractions
that
made
the
challenge
decision
there,
and
four
of
the
five
members
of
the
committee
on
infractions
came
from
public
schools,
so
the
make-up
of
the
membership
at
large
does
not
necessarily
dictate
the
makeup
of
the
governing
body
in
the
organization.
it
is
a
function
of
choice,
just
like--
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
--well,
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
there
was
also...
there
were
also
some
other
issues
in
that
case,
such
as
whether
unlv
as
a
single
state
actor
had
delegated
its
authority
to
regulate
its
athletic
program
to
the
ncaa,
and
whether
that
delegation
was
sufficient
to
make
the
ncaa
a
state
actor,
and
the
court
said
no,
because
there
was
no
statutory
or
constitutional
requirement
that
unlv
engage
in
interscholastic
athletics
at
all,
much
less
that
it
defer
to
the
ncaa
for
the
regulation
of
interscholastic
athletics.
and
you
have
the
same
thing
in
tennessee.
there
is
no
statutory
or
constitutional
requirement
that
any
school,
public
or
private,
have
an
interscholastic
athletic
program,
much
less
that
they
defer
to
the
tssaa
to
regulate
that
program.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
the--
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
--the
record
itself
does
not...
there
is
some
mention
of
that
in
the
brief,
your
honor,
that
there
is
one
in
east
tennessee,
but
that's
not
in
the
record
itself.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
there--
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
--no,
he
is
not.
there
is
a--
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
--there
is
a
rule
that
as
you
read
it,
and
if
you
apply
it
to...
in
the
public
school
context
it
would
require
a
public
school
coach
to
be
an
employee
of
the
public
school
system.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
not...
right,
and
the
key
is
so
that
the
coach
is
not
somebody
off
the
street
who
has
no
accountability
to
the
member
school.
in
brentwood
academy's
case,
the
coach
would
have
to
be
an
employee
of
the
member
school.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
that's
right.
it
allows
for...
and
actually
the
rule...
the
rules
now
do
allow
some
assistant
coaching
from
individuals
who
are
not
full-time
employees
of
the
school.
every
aspect--
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
--the
coach
is...
the
head
coach
is
expected
to
be
a
full-time
employee
of
the
school.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
it
applies
to
private
schools,
except
that
they're
not
required
to
be...
the
term
board
of
education
connotates
a
public
school
board.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
and
that's
not...
the
rule
does
not
apply
to
private
schools
in
that
respect.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
of
the
school.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
1996.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not.
tssaa
was
formed
in
1925
without
any
involvement
of
the
state.
tssaa
operated
for
47
years,
until
1972
without
any
involvement
of
the
state.
in
1972,
the
state
board
of
education
on
its
own,
without
any
legislative
action,
without
any
constitutional
authority,
passed
an
administrative
rule
designating...
it
doesn't...
the
language
of
the
rule
is
important.
it
doesn't
delegate
to
tssaa.
it
designates
tssaa
as
the
association
for
public
schools
to
join
for
their...
for
the
regulation
of
their
interscholastic
athletic
programs,
but
that
designation
is
no
more
than
an
authorization,
or
an
acquiescence
by
the
state
in
the
function
of
the
private
entity,
which
this
court
has
held
over
and
over,
back
starting
with
jackson
and
blum
and
rendell-baker,
that
state
acquiescence,
state
approval
of
the
private
actions
of
a
private
entity
is
not
tantamount
to
state
action
and
does
not
convert
the
private
entity's
acts
into
state
action,
and
that's
what
you
have
here.
and
in
fact,
analytically
speaking,
the
argument
of
the
petitioner
that
somehow
the
makeup
of
the
board
of
control
converts
tssaa's
action
into
state
action
is
really
no
different
than
the
principle
that
this
court
has
rejected
in
rendell-baker,
which
is
extensive
state
regulation
of
a
private
entity
does
not
convert
the
private
entity's--
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
--the
record
reflects
that
there
have
been
times
when
meetings
were
held
during
the
school
days,
meetings
of
the
board
of
control
or
the
legislative
council.
there
are
other
times
when
meetings
are
not.
they're
held
on
saturdays
or
in
the
evenings.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
there...
yes.
i
mean,
that's
left
strictly
up
to
the
local
people.
there
is
no
requirement
in
the
state
of
tennessee,
in
the
law,
that
a
principal
be
reimbursed
for
service
on
the
board
of
control.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
i
could
not
tell
you
what
the
custom
or
practice
is,
your
honor.
i
think
there
are
different
customs
and
practices
from
one
person
to
the
next
and
one
school
system
to
the
next,
and
i
think
in
some
systems
there
is
some
reimbursement,
i
think
in
others
there
is
not.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
state
board
of
education
would
have
the
authority
to
do
that.
the
state--
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
--that's
correct.
the
state
board
of
education,
the
state
of
tennessee
has
chosen
not
to
regulate
interscholastic
athletic
competition,
and
let
me
clarify
that.
the
state
board
of
education
has
the
choice,
if
it
wants
to
regulate
interscholastic
athletic
competition
among
public
schools
in
tennessee.
it
doesn't
have
the
choice
to
regulate
that
competition
among
private
schools.
it
has
the
choice
to
regulate
among
public
schools.
it
has
chosen
not
to.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
yes,
but
it
has...
the
state
of
tennessee...
and
that's
an
important
part
of
fourteenth
amendment
jurisprudence,
your
honor,
is
the
entire
premise
of
the
state
action
doctrine
is
to,
a)
ensure
that
private
parties
are
free
to
conduct
themselves
as
private
parties
without
constitutional
restraint,
and
b)
to
ensure
that
the
state
does
not
have
to
take
responsibility
for
every
private
activity
that
it
allows
to
occur,
simply
because
it
does
not
exercise
its
extreme
authority
to
take
over
certain
responsibilities.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
the
pennsylvania
legislature
could
have
taken
over
responsibility
for
providing
electric
service
to
residents
rather
than
leaving
it
up
to
a
privately
owned
utility
to
provide
that
service.
the
state
chose
not
to
involve
itself
in
that
activity,
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
state
action
requirement
gives
the
state
that
right
without
the
state
having
to
take
responsibility
simply
because
it
could
have
taken
over
something.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
is
a
fair
distinction.
at
least
in
tennessee
i
don't
believe
it
is,
because
interscholastic
athletic
competition
in
tennessee
has
been
something
that's
been
entirely
voluntary
for
the
history
of
that
competition,
dating
back
all
the
way
to
1925.
there
has
never
been
a
requirement
that
any
public
school
have
interscholastic
athletic
competitions--
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
--well,
it
is,
but
it
varies
from
one
school
to
the
next,
and
even
among
public
schools,
what
activities
they
may
engage
in
for--
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
--no.
that...
well,
they
might.
they
might
when
they
find
out
they're
engaging
in
swimming
competition,
for
example.
there
are
schools
in
tennessee--
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
--there
are
schools
in
tennessee...
in
tennessee,
swimming
competition
is
very
unusual.
[laughter]
in
tennessee,
hockey
competition
is
very
unusual,
but
there
are
schools
that
have
it.
it's
not
regulated
by
tssaa.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
it's...
now,
football--
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
--it's
a
bit
unusual
to
say
someone
doesn't
play
football,
but
in
tennessee
there
are
sports
like
swimming,
for
example,
that
some
schools
have
chosen
to
engage
in
and
to
compete
in,
and
compete
for
championships
in.
tssaa
doesn't
even
regulate--
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
--that's
right.
that's
right.
but
that,
we
submit,
your
honor,
does
not
establish
state
action
simply
because
it
is
an
action
that's
customarily
engaged
in.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
there
was
not...
there's
a...
there
is
a
statement
in
the
petitioner's
brief
about
that
that
suggests
that
the
meetings
of
the
board
of
control
occur
during
the
school
day,
and
that
the
principals
are
reimbursed,
but
there's...
that
does
not
appear
in
the
record,
that
i'm--
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
--yes,
your
honor.
as
i
said,
i
think
it
varies
from
one...
i
do
know
that
the
meetings
occur
at
all
different
times.
they
may
occur
on
a
school
day.
they
may
occur
on
a
saturday.
the
meeting
that
led
to
the
filing
of
this
lawsuit
took
place
on
a
saturday
at
a
privately
owned
hotel,
and
whether
there
is
reimbursement
for
the
members
of
the
board
of
control
or
the
legislative
council
varies
from
one
to
the
next.
there
is
no
standard
practice
in
that
respect.
in
this
case
there
are
several
problems
with
the
rule
of
law
that's
proposed
by
brentwood
academy,
problems
that
cause
that
rule
of
law
to
run
contrary
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
first
problem
is
that
the
rule...
and
this
is
even
consistent
with
the
solicitor
general's
remark.
the
rule
proposed
by
brentwood
academy
would
mean
that
if
schools
in
extra...
in
any
extracurricular
activity
compete
with
each
other
in
tennessee,
that...
the
regulation
of
that
interscholastic
activity
is
going
to
amount
to
state
action
regardless
of
how
it's
conducted.
forensics,
band
competition,
cheerleading
competition,
any
sort
of
regulation
of
those
activities
would
all
be
state
action.
it
would--
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
--the...
you
have
to
distinguish
between
what
the
association
can
do
and
what
the
individual
schools
can
do.
an
individual
public
school
could
not
do
that,
and
if
an
individual...
and
that's
one
of
the
problems
with
the
amicus
briefs
in
this
case,
is
they
suggest
that
there's
no
remedy
for
any
sort
of
discrimination
if
you
hold
that
tssaa
is
not
a
state
actor,
and
that's
simply
not
the
case,
because
an
individual
public
school
still
makes
the
choice
of
whether
it's
going
to
be
a
member
of
the
association
or
not,
and
whether
it's
going
to
abide
by
the
rules
or
not,
and
if--
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
--and
brentwood
academy
would
be
free
not
to
join
the
association.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
and
any
public
school
would
be
free
not
to
join
the
association,
and
if
a
public
school
joined
the
association
and
followed
a
rule
like
that,
there
would
be
constitutional
recourse
against
that
school,
or
against
that
local
school
board.
that
does
not
turn
the
actions
of
the
association
itself
into
state
action.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
that's
right.
that's
right,
but
you
would
also--
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
--well,
that's...
that's
where
i
disagree,
your
honor.
they're
not
appearing
as
a
representative
of
that
school.
they're
appearing
as
an
elected
representative
of
all
the
schools,
and
in
that
respect
you
would
open
a
brentwood
academy
up,
for
example,
to
constitutional
challenge.
if
you're
going
to
use
the
association
to
sweep
every
member
up
with
it,
then
you
are
subjecting
the
private
schools--
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
--well,
i
don't
think
there
is
a
claim
that
brentwood
is
a
state
actor,
but
if
you
allow
the
constitution...
if
you
allow
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
reach
the
individual
schools
not
by
challenge
to
the
action
of
an
individual
school,
but
by
challenge
to
the
action
of
the
association,
then
you're
allowing
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
reach
the
private
school
members
of
the
association
as
well.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
but
the
association
has
no
power
to
impose
those
rules--
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
--except
to
the
extent
that
the
schools
choose
to
abide
by
them.
the...
ultimately,
this
case
really
goes
back
to
justice
o'connor's
first
question
when
mr.
blumstein
stood
up
and
that
is,
what
should
the
test
be
and
i
think,
as
justice
o'connor
mentioned
in
the
dissent
in
the
amtrak
case,
if
you
look
at
blum,
if
you
look
at
rendell-baker,
if
you
look
at
jackson,
if
you
look
at
all
the
different
cases
that
have
phrased
the
test
in
all
different
ways,
they
really
come
back
to
whether
the
challenged
action
results
from
a
matter
of
private
choice,
and
that's
exactly
what
you
have
here.
membership
in
tssaa,
service
on
the
board
of
control,
following
the
rules
or
not
following
the
rules
is
a
matter
of
private
choice.
brentwood
academy
made
the
private
choice
that
it
wanted
to
play
in
the
tssaa
and
compete
for
tssaa
championships,
and
now
it
doesn't
want
to
follow
the
rules,
and
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
the
school
itself
in
the
case
of
a
public
school
makes
a...
makes
its--
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
--own
decision,
makes
a--
mr.
richard
l.
colbert
--to
join,
that's
right.
it
is
also
free,
however,
there
is
no
state
compulsion...
the
school,
even
a
public
school
is
free
not
to
join.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
