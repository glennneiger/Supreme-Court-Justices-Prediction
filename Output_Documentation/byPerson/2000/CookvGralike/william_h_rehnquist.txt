chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
99-929,
rebecca
cook
v
don
gralike.
mr.
mcadams.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mcadams,
precisely
what
is
the
instruction
provision?
you
say
this
is
the
first
of
the
three
you
are
talking
about?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
this
is
the
provision
that
judge
hansen
voted
to
uphold?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
doing
his
dissent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
in
arizona,
at
least
at
one
time,
candidates
for
the
senate
and
the
house
of
representatives
had
to
say
they
were
pledged
to
recall,
which
meant
that
if
the
state
legislature
recalled
them,
they
would
have
to
resign.
of
course
they
all
pledged,
and
of
course,
it
never
happened,
so--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
state
legislatures
before
the
17th
amendment,
if
that
was
the
one
that
provided
for
direct
election
of
senators,
communicated
a
great
deal
with
their
senators.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
federal
senators,
well,
senators
from
the
state.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
mcadams.
mr.
franklin,
we
will
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
know
that
that's
true
about
simply
the
17-1
provision
that
judge
hansen
thought
was
permissible,
where
it's
simply
the
legislature
instructs
members
of
congress
to
try
to
push
for
a
term
limits
amendment.
nothing
appears
on
the
ballot
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
i
thought
he
did.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
let
me
ask
you
this,
then.
do
you
think
that
the
provision
that
instructs
members
of
missouri's
congressional
delegation
to
use
their
powers
to
pass
an
amendment
is,
stands
on
the
same
footing
as
the
ones
that
are,
that
are
printed
on
the
ballot?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
constitutionally.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
why
can't
that
provision
be
severed
from
the
other
two?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
petitioner
argues
here
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
right
across
the
board
in
throwing
these
out.
now,
if
we
were
to
conclude
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
on
one,
but
right
on
the
other
two,
that
certainly
is
fairly
raised
by
the
petition.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
think
several
of
us
feel
that
it
isn't
really
an
issue
of
severability
at
all
that
we
would
decide
here.
we
would
simply
say
we
disagree
with
one
phase
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
on
the
constitutional
issue,
we
agree
on
two
others
or
three
others,
and
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals.
you
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part
without
necessarily
getting
to
severability
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
certainly
there
was
much
instruction
to
the
senators
at
one
time.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
what
capacity
was
george
washington
speaking?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
get
this
straight
because
apparently,
something
may
turn
up
that
i
don't
fully
understand.
was
there
an
injunction
against...
was
the
part
that
simply
we
have
been
talking
about,
instructs
or
advise,
was
that
declared
invalid?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
does
the
injunction
have
any
consequence
with
respect
to
that
provision
of
the
missouri
constitution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
provision
that
simply
says
the
legislature
instructs.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
if
missouri
had
done
nothing
but
pass
that
part
which
said
we
instruct
senators
and...
there
is
no
known
prospect
of
enforcement
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
franklin.
ms.
underwood,
we'll
hear
from
you.
ms.
underwood,
section
1
of
section
17
says
we
the
voters
of
missouri
hereby
instruct
each
member
of
our
congressional
delegation
to
use
all
of
his
or
her
delegated
powers
to
pass
the
congressional
term
limits
amendment
set
forth
above.
if
that
stood
by
itself,
would
that
have
any
constitutional
flaw?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
mean,
suppose
there
is
just
no
sanction
for
it.
we
instruct
you
to
do
it,
but
there
is
no
sanction
whatever.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
but
it
involves
a
commission
to
simply
give
up
your
job
if
the
legislature
recalls
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
underwood.
mr.
mcadams,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcadams.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-929,
cook
versus
gralike
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
