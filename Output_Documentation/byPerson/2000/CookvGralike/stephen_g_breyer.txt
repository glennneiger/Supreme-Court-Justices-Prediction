justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
doesn't
the
information,
given
the
courts'
cases
here
anyway,
have
to
be
generally
applicable
and
evenhanded,
like
all
the
regulation
because
if
it's
not,
that's...
i
mean,
that
phrase
comes
from
a
case
called
anderson,
but
there
are
many
of
like
tenor,
it
seems
to
me,
that
if
it's
not
generally
applicable
and
evenhanded,
the
state,
for
no
legitimate
regulatory
interest,
is
biasing
the
election,
which,
which
hurts
the
first
amendment
rights
of
all
those
who
happen
to
think
that
term
limits
is
not
the
most
important
issue
in
the
election,
that
would
prefer
the
election
were
decided
on
the
basis
of
other
issues.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
whatever.
the
economy.
the
environment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
of
course,
that's
generally
true,
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
when
we
get
down
to
the
ballot
itself,
which
normally,
regulation
of
the
ballot
is
not
for
information
providing
purposes.
it
is
for
fair
vote
purposes.
and
that's
why
it
seems
to
me
that
these
cases
have
held
when
we
come
down
to
ballot
regulation,
what
we
are
interested
in
is
whether
the
state's
regulation
is
generally
applicable
and
evenhanded.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
reasonable
in
terms
of
such
purposes
as
the
integrity
of
the
electoral
process,
preventing
voter
confusion,
ensuring
orderliness,
and
ensuring
fairness.
now,
not,
i
haven't
seen
anything
that
says
reasonable
in
terms
of
providing
information
about
one
issue
but
not
other
issues.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
party
affiliation
is
not...
the
candidate,
i
take
it,
voluntarily
associates
himself
with
that
and
wants
that
on
the
ballot.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
are
there
instances
where
the
affiliation
was
put
on
the
ballot
over
the
objection
of
the
candidate?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can
argue
about
whether
a
party
label
is
generally
applicable
and
evenhanded.
so
my
question
is,
are
you
accepting
the
principle,
but
saying
that
this
label
is
just
as
evenhanded
as
a
party
label,
or
are
you
denying
the
principle?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
wasn't
the
principle.
the
principle
i'm
reading
from
the
cases,
which
i
have
said
a
lot
of
times,
i
just
want
to
see
if
you
accept
it,
generally
applicable
and
evenhanded.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
accept
the
principle
and
the
issue
of
whether
this
is
evenhanded?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
seems
to
me,
though,
we
get
a
lot,
we
used
to
get
a
lot
of
things
that
we
call
upon
our
delegation
in
congress
to
declare
this
national
pork
week.
i
mean,
there
are
a
lot
of
those.
they
are
always
passing
things
like
that
in
state
legislatures.
are
all
those
unconstitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
they
said
we
insist
that
you
call
this
national
pork
week,
i
don't
know
if
it's
national
pork
week
or
national
port
week,
but
regardless,
a
lot
of
them
come
in.
now
you're
saying
if
they
use
the
word
insist,
that
it's
unconstitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
have
to
reach
that
in
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mr.
mcadams'
point
was
that
the
first
amendment
arguments
would
apply
equally
to
any
state
election.
so
then
if,
if
that's
important,
the
distinction
you
just
drew,
then
i
guess
we
are
left
with
a
time,
place
and
manner
clause.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
how
would
you
draw
the
word
manner?
how
would
you
explicate
that?
which
i
take
it
what
you
would
want
to
do
is
eliminate
this,
but
then
not
reach
the
first
amendment
question.
you
see?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
but
how
do
you
explicate
the
word
manner?
