justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
are
you
arguing
to
us
now
on
the
assumption
that
the
instruction
standing
alone
has
no
teeth,
no
enforcement
part,
and
you
are
going
to
get
to
the
enforcement
part,
the
teeth
part
later?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
say
that
it's
evenhanded?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
call
it
the
scarlet
letter?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
you
are
trying
to
tell
us
that
this
does
not
disadvantage
the
candidate
in
any
way,
i
just
find
that
very
difficult
to
accept.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
then
it's
not
neutral.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
interferes
with
the
basic
point,
that
the
relation
between
the
congressmen
and
the
people
is
one
that's
direct
and
does
not
involve
intervention
by
the
state.
we
have
two
sets
of
relations
in
the
federal
system,
each
with
its
own
duties
and
responsibilities.
one
is
between
the
federal
government
and
the
citizen
without
the
intervention
of
the
state.
the
other
is
between
the
state
and
the
citizen
without
the
intervention
of
the
federal
government,
except
in
certain
instances
where
an
accommodation
has
to
be
made
like
regulation
of
time,
place
and
manner
of
elections,
but
those
are
neutral.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seeks
to
alter
and
to
regulate
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
purpose
of
doing
this
is
to
control
the
conduct
of
the
congressman
in
office,
and
i
submit
to
you,
there
is
simply
no
authority
for
the
state
to
do
that.
the
voters
can
certainly
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i...
justice
ginsburg
posed
a
hypothetical
that
i'm
interested
in.
suppose
that,
hypothetical
case,
in
a
congressional
district,
the
voters
are
overwhelmingly
against
a
certain
proposition
and
a
state
constitution
has
this
label
providing
they
be
notified
that
they
have
voted
to
the
contrary.
what
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
are,
you
are
allowing
the
state
as
an
entity
to
interfere
with
the
relations
between
the
congressman,
the
congresswoman,
and
those
people
in
the
district.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does,
in
missouri,
do
congressmen
take
an
oath
to
uphold
the
state
constitution?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
do
congressmen
and
senators
in
missouri
take
an
oath
to
uphold
the
state
constitution?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
would
be
very
surprised
if
the
state
could
impose
that
requirement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
doesn't
that
prove
the
point
here?
that
the
state
simply
cannot
interfere
with
the
relation
between
the
congressmen
and
the
voters
directly?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
think
that
the,
that
the
state
can
require
congressmen
and
senators
to
support
the
state
constitution
by
an
oath?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
we
wouldn't.
we
would
be
saying
that
we
find
that
this
is
a
difficult
case.
some
of
these
provisions
withstand
constitutional
attack.
others
don't.
let
me
remand
it
for
you
and
then
can
you
figure
out
the
state
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
would
you
tell
us
whether
in
your
view--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
a
hypothetical
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
state
can
simply
instruct
its
federal
representatives,
congressmen
and
senators,
that
it
wants
them
to
work
for
a
particular
objective.
that's
all
it
says.
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
classic
right
of
petition
on
the
part
of
the
people.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
say
they
use
the
word
advice.
we
wish,
we,
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
missouri,
wish
our
representatives
to
know
that
we
think
they
should
work
for
the
following
objectives,
term
limits,
whatever.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
difference
is
between
instruction
and
advice?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
the
injunction
has
importance
and
continuing
significance
in
the
event
the
legislature
attempts
some
other
means
of
enforcement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
tell
us
about
party
labels,
democrat
and
republican?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
your
first
amendment
argument
is
an
alternative
argument
to
the
first
argument
that
the
state
simply
lacks
the
power
to
do
this?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
noticed
in
his
affidavit
that
he
is
running
for
the
election
in
2000.
i
assume
that's
tomorrow.
he
doesn't...
or
am
i
wrong?
but
he
doesn't
say
that
he,
as
in
golden
versus
wickler,
that
he
intends
to
run
again
and
it's
likely
that
he
will
run
again.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
is
that
in
the
affidavit
before
the
court?
that's
your
representation
to
us
now?
