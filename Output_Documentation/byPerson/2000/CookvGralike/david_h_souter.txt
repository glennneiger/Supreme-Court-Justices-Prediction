justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
their
argument
is
that
it
goes
beyond
information
to
the
point
of
putting
the
thumb
on
the
scale,
because
essentially
it
uses
pejorative
language.
it's
doing
more
than
informing.
it's
saying,
you
know,
these
people
have,
or
this
person
has
violated
a
trust.
and
that's
more
than
information.
that's
a
kind
of
conclusion
of
fault.
that
seems
to
be
one
of
the
points
of
their
objection.
how
do
you
respond
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
not...
i
don't
know
that
they
have
to
make
the
case
that
the
voters
are
going
to
be
overwhelmed.
the
case
that
they
are
making
is
simply
that
the
voters
are
being
given
something
more
than
information.
the
voters
are
being
given
in
effect
a
judgment
by
the
state
that
the
particular
candidates
have
referred
to,
have
done
something
wrong,
and
that
is
more
than
information.
justice
david
h.
souter
could
a
republican
state
label
a
democrat
dirty
democrats?
justice
david
h.
souter
no?
well,
isn't
that
about
what
they
are
doing
here.
disregarded.
refused
to
pledge
or
declined
to
pledge.
that's
why
we
get
into
the
scarlet
letter
analysis.
we
would
be
in
a
scarlet
letter
analysis
if
the
republicans
said
dirty
democrats.
i
don't
see
where
you
are
going
to
draw
the
line.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
does
that
invade
the
province
of
the
voter
in
a
way
that
is
not
true
here?
i
mean,
what's
the
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
get...
the
only
implementation
or
enforcement
that
i'm
aware
of
is
the
implementation
or
enforcement
in
the
form
of
the
ballot
statements;
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
our
case
boils
down
to
whether
in
the
whole
context,
all
the
provisions
in
the
constitution,
may
the
state
include
these,
as
you
put
it,
ballot
disparagements.
that's
the
only
issue
before
us?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
the
only
implementation
or
enforcement
that
we
are
dealing
with,
and
that
the
court
below
dealt
with,
was
the
ballot
statements?
justice
david
h.
souter
was
an
issue
ever...
just
a
technical
point.
was
an
issue
ever
made
of
the
fact
that
the,
what
was
objected
to
here
was
done
by
a
constitutional
amendment
rather
than
by
the
legislature
which
the
clause
itself
refers
to?
