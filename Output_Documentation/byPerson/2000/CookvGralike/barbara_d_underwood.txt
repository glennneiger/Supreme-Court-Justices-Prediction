ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
mr.
chief
justice,
that
would
depend
on
the
meaning
of
instruct.
if
it
were
binding
law
and
unlawful
for
a
congressman
to
disobey
it,
then
it
would
have
many
of
the
same
flaws
as
this
statute.
if
it
were
advisory,
then
it
would
not,
but
we
know--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
the
question
would
be
whether
it
was
meant
to
have
binding
effect,
and
whether,
for
instance,
the
legislature
might,
somebody
might
seek
mandamus
to
enforce
it,
whether
it
was
seen
as
enforceable
or
not.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
if
it's
completely
unenforceable,
i
think
you
are
saying
it
is
advisory,
in
which
case--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--instruct
is
a
word
that
can
have
many
meanings
and
if
it
means
advisory,
then
i
think
it
would
not
be
objectionable,
but
we--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
if
you
can
say
that
the
legislator
was
a
lawbreaker,
violated
the
law,
did
something
unlawful,
if
that's
the
meaning
of
instruct--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--that's
a
different
point.
in
prince,
this
court
looked
at
instructions
to
sheriffs,
for
which
there
was
no
enforcement,
and
treated
those
as
binding.
i
think
the
question
would
be
what
that
hypothetical
statute,
which
we
don't
have
before
us,
means.
this
statute
we
know
missouri
meant
to
make
enforceable.
we
know
that
because
it
created
an
enforcement
mechanism,
and
so
the
difficult
question
that
you
put,
which
would
require
determining
what
that
hypothetical
statute
meant,
isn't
here.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
it's
still
the
case
that
it's,
that
it's
an
enforcement,
one,
because
of
the
pejorative
language,
which
you
have
asked
me
to
set
aside,
but
is
present
here.
two,
because
it
is
a
decision
by
the
state
legislature
to
focus
the
attention
of
the
voters
and
judge
candidates
on
a
single
issue.
and
three,
because
it
is
done
in
the
voting
booth
and
not
in
a
public
forum
where
there
is
an
opportunity
to
respond
and
to
debate,
so
it
is
an
effort,
it
has
the
intended
purpose
and
the
effect
of
disadvantaging
a
class
of
candidates,
and
that's
something
this
court
said
in
term
limits
that
the
state
cannot
use
its
elections
clause
authority
to
do.
it
interferes
with,
as
justice
kennedy
said,
the
direct
relationship
between
the
national
government
and
its
citizens.
there
is
no
other
example
of
an
effort
to
enforce
an
instruction
with
ballot
labels
in
the
case
of
a
federal
senator
or
representative,
except
for
the...
the
only
one
we
have
been
able
to
find
is
the
arizona
recall
pledge.
that
went
off
the
ballot
in
1973.
there
is
still
a
request
to
pledge,
but
it
is
no
longer
enforced
by
a
ballot
instruction.
and
of
course,
it
doesn't
involve
a
position
on
an
issue.
it
doesn't
involve
a
commitment
to
take
a
position
on
a
particular
issue
in
the
legislature.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
it
does.
it's
unique,
as
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
tell,
in
the,
in
the
history
and
the
laws
of
this
country,
and
it
has
never
come
before
the
court.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes,
i
think
the
principal,
the
principal
concern
of
the
united
states
in
this
case
is
that
the
state
has
a
limited
authority
under
the
elections
clause
and
has
improperly
or
either
abused,
misused
its
authority
or
exceeded
its
authority.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
it's
not
necessary
to
reach
the
first
amendment--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--the
word
manner,
in
the
context
of
the
time,
place
and
manner
clause,
means
the
mechanics,
the
procedures
of
an
election,
neutral,
evenhanded
regulations
that
enable
the
orderly
election
process
to
occur,
and
what
it
particularly
doesn't
mean
is
putting
a
thumb
on
the
scale
to
influence
the
result.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes.
there
is
a
question
as
you
have
noted,
about
whether
the
time,
place
and
manner
authority
that
the
constitution
gives
to
the
state
legislatures
goes
to
any
entity
that
the
state
gives
legislative
authority
to,
or
whether
it
actually
only
goes
to
legislatures.
we
haven't...
in
either
case,
even
assuming
that
it
isn't
restricted
to
the
legislature
as
such,
it's
our
position
that
the
power
has
simply
been
exceeded,
doesn't
go,
doesn't
authorize
the
making
of
nonneutral
regulations
that
are
designed
to
and
have
the
effect
of
attempting
to
influence
the
outcome.
with
respect
to
other
labels
that
do
sometimes
appear
on
ballots,
party
labels
and
incumbency
designations,
those
have,
those
are
all
understood
as
helping
the
voter
identify
the
candidates.
they
are
objective,
identifying
information.
they
don't,
for
one
thing,
involve
a
state
official
in
assessing
whether
the
label
should
apply
or
not,
as
this
regulation
does
here.
the
secretary
of
state,
subject
to
a
state
review
process,
has
to
determine
whether
the
label
applies,
and
the
label
is
a
judgmental
label,
not
simply
an
identifying
piece
of
information.
the
other
thing
about
parties,
of
course,
is
that
party
labels
recognize
the
role
political
parties
play
in
the
electoral
process,
provide
candidates
with
a
reasonable
level
of
community
support,
provide
voters
with
a
means
of
exercising
their
first
amendment
right
of
political
association,
and
the
party
label
therefore
reflects
that
the
party
is
the
mechanism
that
put
the
candidate
on,
on
the
ballot.
it's
quite
different
from
a
label
that
is
designed
to
influence
the
election
and
also
to
constrain
the
behavior
of
the
legislator
after
having
been
elected
as
this,
as
this
provision
does.
i
think,
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--the
elections
clause.
the
court
of
appeals
actually
didn't...
well,
the
elections
clause
has
been
in
the
case
from
the
beginning
because
it
is
the
provision
that
the
state
has
used
to
defend
its
authority
against
all
other
attack.
that
is
the
argument,
when
the
argument
is
made
that
this
is
a
qualification,
or
this
is
an
improper
this
or
that,
the
state
has
said
it's
a
proper
exercise
of
its
authority
under
the
elections
clause,
and
we
say
it
is
not.
i
think
that's
the
simplest
way
to
decide
this
case,
even
though
there
are
a
number
of
other
issues
that
could
also
be
reached.
