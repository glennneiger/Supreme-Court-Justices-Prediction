but
part
2
of
the
missouri
constitutional
article
8,
section
17,
is
severable,
is
it?
justice

o'connor
the
ballot
proposition?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
your
point
is
just
that
disregarding
for
the
moment
the
provision
that
has
to
appear
on
the
ballot
by
a
candidate's
name,
that
the
rest
of
it
doesn't
violate
article
5?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
on
your
theory,
i
suppose--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
right.
i'd
like
to
ask
you
whether
if
we
were
to
uphold
this
kind
of
a
provision,
whether
it
wouldn't
then
be
possible
for
a
state
to
have
by
initiative
or
referendum
a
similar
provision
saying
that
we
instruct
our
members
of
congress
that
they
are
to
support
a
constitutional
amendment
allowing
prayer
in
schools,
or
a
constitutional
amendment
reversing
an
abortion
decision,
or
any
other
hot
button
issue
where
the
voters
of
the
state
decide
they
are
going
to
instruct
members
of
congress,
and
then
under
your
theory,
i
suppose,
a
provision
could
be
inserted
on
the
ballot
opposite
the
name
of
any
candidate
who
refuses
to
express
a
position
or
disavow
that
position
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--informs
the
voters;
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
certainly
would
change
the
election
process
as
we
have
known
it,
wouldn't
it?
