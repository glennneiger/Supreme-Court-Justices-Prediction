mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
missouri
has
attempted
to
use
its
control
over
the
ballot
to
determine
the
issues
upon
which
federal
elections
will
be
decided
and
to
influence
voters
to
vote
against
candidates
who
do
not
support
a
state
preferred
political
viewpoint.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
two
points,
your
honor.
first,
clarification.
judge
hansen
did
not
find
that
to
be
constitutional.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
no.
on
page
a-23
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
judge
hansen
clearly
stated
that
he
agreed
with
the
majority
that
sections
17,
18,
and
19
were
unconstitutional.
he
differed
as
to
whether
15
and
16,
which
is
essentially
the
preamble,
could
be
severed.
the
severance
question,
your
honor,
is
not
before
the
court.
it
was
addressed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
it
has
been
waived.
the
petitioner
could
have
chosen
if
it
had
wanted
to
present
that
issue
in
its
petition
or
its
brief.
it
did
not,
and
perhaps
the
reason
it
did
not
is
the
question
of
severability
is
predominantly
one
of
state
law
as
to
whether
under
missouri
state
law
various
provisions
would
be
severable
from
one
another,
whether
the
voters
would
have
voted
for
a
preamble
that
didn't
do
anything.
that
is
a
question
of
state
law.
it
was
not
presented
in
the
petition.
it
was
not
presented
in
the
brief.
if
the
court
had
been
presented
with
it,
it's
likely
the
court
would
decline
to
consider
a
question
of
state
law
such
as
that
one.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
we
believe
first
that
it
stands
together
with
this
law.
if,
in
a
hypothetical--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--the
answer
is
if
there
were
a,
just
instruction,
nothing
else,
which
is
not
what
this
case
is
about,
if
there
were,
we
would
argue
in
such
a
case
that
it
would
be
in
that
case
an
impermissible
chilling
effect
on
speech.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
the
principal
reason
is
because
the
severance
question
is
not
before
the
court.
if--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--i
would
say
not,
your
honor,
and
for
the
reason
that
the
severability
issue
is
one
of
state
law.
however,
if--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--i
think
it
would
be
open
to
the
court,
had
the
issue
been
raised
and
briefed
and
we
had
briefed
the
question
under
missouri
state
law
as
to
what,
what
is
or
is
not
severable.
however,
one
also
needs
to
look
at
the
remedy
in
this
case.
the
remedy
is
not
that
certain
provisions
are
excised
from
the
constitution.
what
the
remedy
says
is
the
state
of
missouri
is
enjoined
from
implementing
or
enforcing
the
provisions
of
the
constitution,
including
section
17,
which
contains
both
the
instructions
and
the
labels
through
which
they
are
enforced.
this
court
need
only
affirm
that
judgment.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
because
the
court
would
be
reaching
the
severability
issue
in
that
case
and
remanding
it
to--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--but
the
court
of
appeals
did
address
the
severability
question.
in
the
last
footnote
of
its
appeal,
it
held--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--well,
let
me
then
get
into
why
the
court,
if
the
court
were
just
to
consider
the
instruction
provision
standing
alone,
which
i
understand
is
the
issue
that
was
raised,
we
would
argue,
for
the
first
time
today,
if
the
court
were
to,
just
to
consider
that,
it
would
have
to
hold
that
contrary
to
judge
bartlett's
decision
in
this
case,
the
instructions
provisions
can
be
implemented
or
enforced,
which
is
the
injunction
that
this
court,
we
are
asking
the
court
to
affirm.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
no,
it
is
not.
and
it
would
be
in
our
view
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
it
would
be
unprecedented
and
we
have
uncovered
no
historical
evidence
to
show
that
any,
it
has
ever
been
tried
before
that
an
instruction
to
a
representative
to
vote
and
take
other
legislative
activities
in
a
particular
manner--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--the
difference
here,
and
it's
an
important
difference,
is
this
instruction
is
codified
as
law,
is
given
the
force
of
legal
command,
it
is
in
the
missouri
constitution.
every
person
in
this--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--it
would
be
different,
your
honor.
and
we
have
a
quote
from
george
washington
in
our
brief
in
which--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--yes,
your
honor.
and
george
washington
said,
and
it's
quoted
at
page
29
of
our
brief,
he
said
the
sense...
with
regard
to
instructions
specifically,
he
said
the
sense,
but
not
the
law
of
the
district
may
be
given.
it
is
different
to
say
we
advise
that
you
do
this.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
he
was
in
that
case
writing
a
letter
to
his
nephew
who
was
a
future
justice
of
this
supreme
court,
bushrod
washington.
but
he
said
that,
and
we
are
not
saying
that
that
is
a
principle
of
law,
but
the
reasoning
applies
here
and
it
applies
for
the
following
reason.
people
take
seriously
their
obligations
to
follow
the
law.
and
i
think
that
applies
perhaps
even
more
strongly
to
members
of
congress.
a
member
of
congress
who
is
faced
with
a
law
that
says
we
hereby
instruct
you
as
a
matter
of
missouri
constitutional
law,
codified
as
a
provision
of
law,
given
the
force
of
legal
command
to
do
this
act
in
congress.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
and
all
we
are
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to,
as
judge
bartlett
did,
say
that
the
state
may
not
implement
or
enforce
the
provision.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
that
is
correct.
and
they
are--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--yes.
no.
the
issue,
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
as
the
court
of
appeals
held,
article
8
of
the
constitution
may
not
be
implemented
or
enforced.
again,
the
court
held
that.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
that
is
correct.
and
judge
bartlett
was
correct
when
he
said
that
the
remedy
is,
we
hereby
enjoin
the
state
from
implementing
or
enforcing
article
7,
section
17,
which
contains
both
the
instructions
and
the
enforcement.
to
take
a
hypothetical,
if
a
law
came
before
this
court
where
at
section
whatever
of
the
statute
and
section...
subsection
a
said
no
person
may
criticize
the
president,
subsection
b
said
anyone
who
violates
subsection
a
will
be
given
a
$1,000
fine.
the
remedy
of
such
a
case
would
be,
as
the
remedy
was
here,
to
enjoin
or
enforce,
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
or
implementation
of
such
a
statute.
that
is
all
we
are
asking
the
court
to
affirm
in
this
case.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
there
was
no
declaratory
judgment
in
this
case.
there
was
simply
an
injunction.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
which
provision,
your
honor?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
yes.
it
is
a
consequence
that
they
may
not
implement
or
enforce
that
provision.
the
way
they
do
it,
as
justice
souter
mentioned,
was...
is
through
the
instructions,
through
the
labels.
and
the
labels
we
believe
are
unconstitutional
for
the
principal
reason
that
they
exceed
the
state's
limited
delegated
authority
under
the
elections
clause
to
regulate
only
the
times,
places
and
manners
of
holding
federal
elections.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
certainly,
your
honor.
a
decision
by
this
court
that
an
instruction
to
a
sitting
member
of
congress
to
vote
in
a
certain
way
may
be
implemented
or
enforced,
we
believe
would
be
contrary
to
the
constitution.
it
would
violate
the
first
amendment.
it
would
be
a
chilling
effect
on
speech.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
we
would
argue
in
such
a
case
that
it
would
contravene
the
first
amendment
because
it
would
be
a
chilling
effect
on
speech
for
the
reasons
essentially
that
george
washington
stated,
which
is
that
the
sense,
but
not
the
law
of
the
district,
may
be
given.
this
is
unprecedented.
we
are
not
aware
of
any--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--it
would
still
be
the
law,
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
no.
but
they
do
not
as--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--we
are
saying
if
they
use
the
word
instruct.
but
the
word,
the
instructions
are
just,
are
not--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--no.
no.
we
do
not.
and
the
reason
is
because
the
instructions
are
part
and
parcel
of
the
law
which
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
stand
or
falls
on
its
own,
and
the
principal
reason
that
the
law
as
a
whole
falls
is
because
it
does
exceed
the
state's
neutral
power
to
serve
as
a,
an
administrator
of
federal
elections
and
instead
has
the
state
putting
its
thumb
on
the
electoral
scale.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
yes.
the
reason
that
party
labels
would
be
permissible
generally
speaking
is
because
they
are
integrally
related
to
the
conduct,
the
orderly
conduct
of
an
election
which
itself
is
organized
around
party
lines.
in
missouri,
as
in
elsewhere,
one
does
not
come
to
be
on
the
ballot
strictly
as
an
individual,
but
rather
as
the
nominee
in
most
instances
of
a
party.
it
would
be
a
different
case
if
the
state,
and
i
understand
it
to
be
conceded
here,
if
the
state
said
to
an
individual
who
had
achieved
a
ballot
spot
as
an
independent,
that
nevertheless,
that
person
must
disclose
that
they
are,
for
example,
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
the
socialist
party.
that
would
not
be
related
to
the
orderly
conduct
of
an
election
organized
around
party
lines
because
that
would
not
have
anything
to
do
with
how
the
person
got
on
the
ballot.
second,
a
party
label
unlike
the
labels
in
this
case,
a
neutral
requirement
that
all
party
labels
be
listed
is
not
related
to
the
content
of
any
individual's
views
on
an
issue.
any
connotation
that
the
voters
draw
between
parties
and
viewpoints
is
imperfect
at
best,
but
more
important,
it's
a
connotation
that
the
party
and
the
candidate
voluntarily
associate
themselves
with
in
the
process
of
running
in
an
election
which
itself
is
organized
around
party
lines.
here,
by
contrast,
the
labels
are
both
content
and
viewpoint
based.
they
are
content
based
because
they
single
out
only
one
issue,
term
limits,
and
say
to
the
voters,
that
is
the
issue
that
we
deem
to
be
most
important
of
your
consideration,
most
worthy
of
your
consideration.
and
second,
even
worse,
they
are
viewpoint
discriminatory.
they
are
viewpoint
discriminatory
because
the
state
is
singling
out
one
side
of
the
issue
and
is
labeling
only
one
side
and
it
is
doing
it
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
telling
the
voters
that
this
person
has
disregarded
or
failed,
pledged
to
follow
a
policy
which
the
state
deems
to
be
the
correct
one.
and--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--yes.
the
first
argument
is
the
state
lacks
the
power.
it
is
an
alternative
argument
under
the
first
amendment.
it
relies
on
many
of
the
same
principles,
however.
the
elections
clause
is
a
limited
delegation
of
authority
to
regulate
only
the
times,
the
places,
the
manners
of
holding
federal
elections.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
no,
your
honor.
it
was
put
before
judge--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--yes.
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
yes,
he
did,
your
honor.
one
can
find
the
ruling
at
pages
a-42
and
43
of
the
appendix
of
the
petition,
and
a-45
and
46.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
no,
your
honor.
that
was
not
raised
below,
but
it
has
been
raised
by
all
parties
in
this
court
and
has
been
briefed
by
all
parties
in
this
court,
but
it
was
not
raised
below.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
gralike.
yes.
the
court,
we
believe
that
that
case
would
still
be
capable
of
repetition,
yet
evading
review
under
this
court's
precedents.
however,
mr.
harman
did
intervene
as
a
respondent
on
appeal.
mr.
harman
has
the
same
interests
as
mr.
gralike.
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
two
points.
first,
your
honor,
he
did
run.
he
was
not
successful
in
the
primary.
he
does
intend
to
run
again.
he
has
run
in
the
past.
he
intends
to
run
again.
but
the
court's--
mr.
jonathan
s.
franklin
--it's
my
representation,
but
the
court's
elections
cases
make
clear
that
that
is
not
a
requirement
in
the
court's
elections
cases,
and
those
are
the
cases
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
at
footnote
one,
i
believe
in
this
context.
but
in
any
event,
i
will
represent
to
you
that
he
does
intend
to
run
again.
the
state,
as
this
court
has
held,
has
the
authority
under
the
elections
clause
to
enact
procedural
or
mechanical
regulations
that
are
nondiscriminatory,
evenhanded
and
politically
neutral.
it
does
not
have
the
delegated
power
to
single
out
one
issue
which
it
deems
more
worthy
of
voter
consideration
than
others
or
to
disadvantage
candidates
who
hold
disfavored
views
on
that
issue.
the
state
of
missouri,
purportedly
to
maintain
the
integrity
and
the
neutrality
and
the
sanctity
of
the
electoral
process,
prohibits
candidates
and
their
supporters
from
expressing
any
views
to
the
voters
within
25
feet
of
the
polling
place.
yet
the
state
itself
now
seeks
to
be
inside
the
voting
booth
to
inject
its
own
preferred
views
and
viewpoints
on
the
ballot.
such
a
manipulation
of
the
ballot
would
in
our
view,
if
upheld,
seriously
undermine
the
system
of
free
and
fair
democratic
elections
that
sets
this
nation
apart
from
so
many
others
in
the
world.
thank
you.
