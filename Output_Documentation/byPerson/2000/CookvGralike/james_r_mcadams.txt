mr.
james
r.
mcadams
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
there
are
three
democratic
principles
at
stake
in
this
case.
first,
the
people
may
instruct
their
legislators.
second,
the
people
may
request
information
and
receive
information
on
the
ballot
about
candidate
behavior.
and
third,
the
people
may
put
the
information
called
for
by
article
8
on
the
ballot.
none
of
these
activities
violate
any
provision
of
the
united
states
constitution.
with
regard
to
the
instruct
provision
first,
this
is
the
issue
that
divided
the
panel
opinion
from
the
dissent.
the
instructional
provisions
are
contained
in
sections
15,
16,
and
17,
paragraph
one,
of
missouri's
article
8.
the
eighth
circuit
said
these
instructions
violated
article
5
because
the
voters
were
third
parties
to
the
amendment
process.
article
5
doesn't
say
that.
article
5
provides
a
specific
mechanism
by
which
the
constitution
can
be
amended,
and
it
allocates
functions
in
article
5
for
certain
branches
of
the
government
to
perform.
the
exclusion
of
the
people
from
any
specific
one
of
those
functions
does
not
exclude
the
people
from
the
right
to
communicate
to
their
representatives
that
they
want
the
constitution
amended.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
yes.
this
is
the
first
of
the
three
principles
that
i'm
talking
about,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
and
the
instruction
is
physically
contained
in
section
17,
paragraph
one
of
the
proposed
amendment,
and
it
relates
to
sections
15
and
16
of
the
amendment,
your
honor,
section
15
stating
the
intention
of
the
missouri
voters,
and
section
16
specifically
stating
the
proposed
constitutional
amendment
that
the
voters
support.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
standing
alone,
the
instructions
provisions,
these
three
sections,
have
no
teeth.
they
are
a
nonbinding
instruction.
and
as
we
were
instructed
by
then
justice
rehnquist's
opinion
in
kimble,
the
nonbinding
instructions
and
advice
by
the
voters
to
a
legislature
does
not
violate
article
5.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
although
i
should
say,
he
did
not
specifically
mention
section
17.1.
he
only
specifically
mentioned
15
and
16.
the
instruction
provision
of
17.1
would
be
included
in
his
logic.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
yes,
your
honor.
pursuant
to
section
22
of
article
8,
any
provision
the
court
would
find
unconstitutional
in
article
8
is
severable
from
the
remainder.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
that
would
be
correct,
your
honor.
moving
on
to
the
second
principle,
missourians
may
request
information
and
may
receive
information
on
the
ballot
about
congressional
candidate
behavior.
this
court
has
indicated
and
respondents
do
not
contest
that
states
may
provide
information
on
the
ballot.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
well,
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
that
really
goes
to
point
three
that
i
made
in
my
opening,
that
it
goes
to
the
specific
ballot
information
and
i
respond
to
that
by
saying,
there
is
nothing
that
provides
voters
valuable
information
that
couldn't
be
used
by
those
voters
as
the
basis
for
a
decision
to
vote
against
a
candidate.
there
is
no
indication
in
this
case,
no
evidence
in
this
case,
that
voters
will
be
so
overwhelmed
by
the
information
contained
in
the
ballot
information
that
they
will
have
the
will--
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
--i
simply
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
the
voters
are
not
being
given
any
more
than
information.
the
state
of
missouri--
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
--well,
i
would
say
that
party
labels
go
on
the
ballot
at
a
time
when
voters
have,
i
mean
candidates
have
no
opportunity
to
respond
back.
the
history
of
the
country
is
such
that
party
labels
were
outcome
determinative
in
numerous
congressional
districts,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
there
is
something
comparable,
your
honor.
in
the
state
of
nebraska,
in
the
early
1900s
as
the
people
became
disaffected
with
congress'
unwillingness
to
amend
the
constitution
to
provide
for
the
direct
election
of
senators,
they
placed
labels
on
the
ballot
about
whether
state
legislative
candidates--
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
--well,
first
amendment
is
one
of
the
claims
that
they
make,
your
honor,
and
the
first
amendment
claim
would
equally
be
evadable
to
a
situation
like
the
state
of
nebraska
did.
we
would
not
have,
for
example,
a
qualifications
clause
analysis
that
would
apply
to
the
state.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
i
believe
there...
not
exactly
like
this
label,
your
honor.
there
are
situations
where
federal
candidates
have,
for
example,
their
address
disclosed.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
i
was
not
aware
of
that
example,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
i'm
not
aware
of
that,
your
honor.
the
rules
would
seem
to
provide
states,
the
election
clause
would
seem
to
provide
states
an
opportunity
to
place
information
on
the
ballot.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
well--
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
--there
is
nothing
about
providing
information
that
dictates
that
it
is
the
basis
upon
which
voters
will
choose.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
well,
i
think
timmons
used
the
phrase
reasonable.
the
state
could
enact
reasonable
regulations.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
well,
your
honor,
right
now,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
state
only
provides
information
about
party
affiliation.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
some
do
and
some
don't.
in
the
history--
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
--there
are
no
cases
in
that
regard,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
i'm
quite
certain
in
the
south.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
i'm
quite
certain
that
is
true,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that's
true
for
third
party
candidates
today
as
well.
in
the
example
that
the
respondents
give
about
the
one
time
this
was
done
in
california,
they
give
an
example
where
a
state
legislative
candidate
who
had
won
a
plurality
in
the
party
primary
came
back
in
the
run
off
election
and
lost
to
someone
who
did
not
have
a
label.
it
seems
that
what
respondents
are
offended
by
there
is
that
the
party
label
designation
was
not
the
piece
of
information
that
controlled
the
electoral
result.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
i'm
not
denying
the
principle
that
the
state
cannot
mislead
voters.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
and
i
believe
this
is
generally
applicable.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
i
am
not
aware
of
any
basis
for
disputing
that
principle,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
i
don't
call
it
the
scarlet
letter,
your
honor.
people
who
apply
a
pejorative
label
to
this
enactment
call
it
a
scarlet
letter.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
well,
in
that
situation
the
state
is
expressing
a
judgment
on
the
candidate
that
actually
invades
the
province
of
the
voter.
here
we
are
not
doing
that.
there
are
eight
specific
behaviors
that
are
being
evaluated.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
well,
the
distinction
is
that
that
amounts
to,
in
my
mind,
a
recommendation
to
vote
against
the
candidate.
it
would
be
as
if
in
this
case
we
instead
of
using
the
label
disregarded
voters'
instructions
concerning
term
limits
for
this
same
behavior,
we
use
the
phrase
traitor.
that
is
misleading.
it
would
essentially
take
away,
i
believe,
and
overbear
the
will
of
the
voter
if
they
believe
they
were
voting
for
a
candidate
who
was
a
traitor.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
and
that
is
not
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor.
this
may
disadvantage
some
candidates
with
some
voters.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
well,
it's
just
as
neutral
as
party
labels,
because
party
labels
disadvantage
candidates.
it
is
the
equivalent--
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
--i
do
not
know
of
any
state
that
does
that,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
yes.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
i
could.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
that
is--
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
yes.
that
is
correct,
if
they
did
it
through
this
mechanism,
they
set
forth
the
specific
constitutional
provision
that
they
wanted
enacted
and
the
behaviors
that
they
wanted
to
be
evaluated,
so
that
there
was
no--
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
--well,
in
footnote
four
of
foster
versus
love,
this
court
left
open
the
question
of
whether
or
not
states
must
use
conventional
means
to
hold
elections.
but
i
submit
to
you
that
we
already
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
and
we
know
it
because
the
way
in
which
ballots
have
been
distributed
has
changed
throughout
history.
initially,
we
started
out
with
nothing
but
write
in
ballots.
then
parties
were
actually
around
printing
up
ballots
for
people
to
cast
and
using
that
mechanism
to
control
and
buy
elections,
and
the
states
came
up
with
a
mechanism
which
allowed
the
states
to
prepare
the
ballot.
so
there
is
nothing
that
requires
us
to
use
the
conventional
method.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
well,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
they
are
obligations.
i
think
they
are
instructions,
and
they
are
nonbinding
instructions.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
your
honor,
you
only
have
to
propose
if
it's
not
otherwise
been
proposed.
you
only
have
to
sponsor
if
it's
not
otherwise
been
sponsored.
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
instructions
that
require
you
to
speak
in
favor
of
this
proposed
amendment.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
but
this
doesn't
interfere
with
that
relationship,
your
honor.
the
only
thing
this
does
is
allows
voters--
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
--i
disagree,
your
honor.
this
only
allows
the
people
to
evaluate
candidate
behavior.
we
have
in
our
country
a
tradition
now
where
legislative
candidates
obfuscate
their
record
to
the
point
where
it
is
difficult
for
the
electorate
to
determine
what
they
have
done.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
the
last
sentence
of
section
16,
we,
the
people
of
the
state
of
missouri,
have
chosen
to
amend
the
state
constitution
to
inform
the
voters
regarding
incumbent
and
nonincumbent
federal
candidate
support
for
the
proposed
amendment.
this
is
an
informational
provision
to
the
voters,
so
that
they
can
evaluate
candidate
behavior,
and
this
is
information
they
have
asked
for.
this
is
the
kind
of
information
that
could
seriously
improve
the
ability
of
the
citizens
to
engage
in
an
educated
electoral
decision,
and
could
combat,
i
think
rather
effectively,
voter
disillusionment
with
the
system.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
this
proposal
passed
in
every
congressional
district
in
the
state
of
missouri.
now
there
are
28
counties
that
it
did
not
pass
in.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
well,
the
federal
government
through
the
elections
clause
tells
the
states
that
the
state
regulates
the
ballot.
it
is
not
inappropriate,
then,
for
the
state
to
have
consistent
regulations
across
the
state
regarding
that
proposal,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
the
same
result
would
apply
because
the
elections--
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
--that's
not
true,
your
honor.
because
if
the
people
in
that
district
voted
against
term
limits,
they
will
take
a
look
at
this
ballot
information
and
they
will
not
use
it
as
a
rational
basis
to
vote
against
a
candidate
unless
their
opinion
has
changed.
if
their
opinion
has
changed,
then
they
will
use
this
information.
but
it
does
not
interfere
with
the
relationship.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
absolutely,
your
honor.
there
is
a
lot
of
historical
evidence
that
state
legislators
instructed
the
state
senators.
in
fact,
the
first--
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
--yes.
senators
from
the
state
impacted
federal
senators,
and
in
fact,
that
is
the
mechanism
in
large
part
which
propelled
the
first
10
amendments
and
the
11th
amendment
to
passage.
after
the
enactment
of
article
5,
the
states
directed
that
those
be
passed.
eight
of
the
original
13
colonies
issued
such
instructions
for
one
of
those
11
amendments.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
no.
it
applies
to
both,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
well,
we
have...
we
have...
the
court
has
held
that
elections...
pardon
me...
people
cannot
politic
within
so
many
feet
of
the
polling
place,
your
honor.
that
is
true.
but
the
court
has
never
held
that
the
people
cannot
have
the
information
in
the
voting
booth
with
them
that
they
want.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
yes.
i
believe
they
could,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
do
federal
congressmen
take
such
an
oath?
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
i'm
not
aware
that
federal
representatives
and
senators
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
i
think
that
is
true.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
there
is
nothing
that
would
suggest
that
the
state
couldn't
ask
federal
congressmen
to
take
such
a
pledge,
and
if
they
failed
to
do
so,
report
that
they
declined
to
take
such
a
pledge.
the
federal
candidates--
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
--i
think
they
can
ask
them
if
they
will.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
james
r.
mcadams
thank
you,
your
honor.
it
tashjian,
this
court
said,
any
claim
that
we
enhance
the
ability
of
the
citizenry
to
make
wise
decisions
by
restricting
the
flow
of
information
to
them
must
be
viewed
with
some
skepticism.
this
is
precisely
respondent's
claim,
and
it
should
be
viewed
with
considerable
skepticism.
as
to
the
elections
clause
claim
made
by
the
respondent,
the
court
said
in
smiley
that
the
time,
place
and
manner
language
are
comprehensive
words
that
embrace
authority
to
provide
a
complete
code
for
congressional
elections.
and
in
tashjian
they
said
state
control
over
the
election
process
for
state
officers
is
coextensive
with
that
grant
to
the
states
under
the
elections
clause.
it
is
a
broad
power.
the
alleged
damage
done
to
congressional
candidates
because
of
the
ballot
label
is
something
that
needs
to
be
analyzed
under
a
punishment
analysis.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
suggests
this
language
is
punishing,
and
that
was
respondent's
burden.
under
the
qualifications
clause,
it
was
respondent's
burden
to
show
that
the
sole
basis
for
putting
this
on
was
to
add
a
qualification
indirectly.
the
language
of
the
amendment
itself
indicates
that
it
is
not
the
sole
basis
to
add
a
qualification
indirectly.
it
is
the
sole
purpose
to
one,
inform
the
voters,
and
two,
to
amend
the
constitution.
it
was
argued
that
the
severance
issue
was
waived.
this
is
not
so.
this
is
contained
in
the
response
to
the,
or
pardon
me,
to
the
reply
to
the
cert.
in
point
four,
we
say
specifically
because
we
use
the
word
or
in
the
first
question,
we
preserve
the
severance
question
and
we
have
already
dealt
with
that
in
the
reply
suggestions.
if
there
are
no
further
questions?
