mr.
mcadams,
can
you
point
to
any
other
example?
there
have
been
examples
in
briefs
certainly
of
instructions
that
were
given
at
the
time
of
the
constitutional
convention,
but
this
has
been
labelled
a
scarlet
letter
label.
it's
not
the
same
as
democrat
and
republican.
it
says,
disregarded
voters'
instruction.
it
says,
declined
to
pledge
to
support.
are
there
any
other
such
labels
that
go
on
a
ballot
at
a
time
when
the
candidate
has
no
opportunity
to
answer
back?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
asked
you,
you
gave
the
party
labels
example.
is
there
anything
comparable
to
disregarded
voters'
instruction
on
issue
x,
declined
to
pledge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
know
of
anything
comparable
to
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh,
but
that's
state
legislative
candidates,
and
that's
different.
there
is
no
federal
constitutional
control,
except
perhaps
there
might
be
a
first
amendment
argument,
but
we
are
talking
about
here...
whatever
the
state
wants
to
do
vis
a
vis
state
legislatures
is
different
from
what
they
can
do,
vis
a
vis
people
who
are
in
a
national
body
and
when
they
are
there,
they
are
representing
all
the
people.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
do
you
have
any
other
example
of
someone
running
for
federal
office,
the
house
or
the
senate,
where
there
is
such
a
label?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
mcadams,
the
point
has
been
made
very
forcefully
that
this
is
a
national
legislature.
and
you
are
saying
you
could
freight
down
someone
from
a
state
with
all
kinds
of
policies
that
may
be
preferred
by
that
state
and
that
person
would
be
laden
with
those
obligations,
even
though
he
or
she
is
now
a
member
of
a
national,
as
opposed
to
a
state
body.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
list
of
things
that
the
person
is
supposed
to
do
if
you
are
going
to
be
faithful
to
that
pledge,
you
have
to
do
all
those
things.
you
have
to
sponsor
these
measures,
and
you
have
to
urge
other
people
to
join
you,
and
you
have
to
take
a
very
active
role.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about,
there
are
a
number
of
districts
within
missouri
where
the
people
were
not
in
favor
of
this
proposition.
and
if
the
person
is
supposed
to
represent,
disregard
voters'
instruction,
he
might
not
have
disregarded
the
voters'
instructions
from
his
district.
his
district
may
have
been
overwhelmingly
against
this
proposal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
right.
someone
is
from
one
of
those
counties.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
something
about
this,
the
perception,
say,
of
a
voter.
we
very
carefully
limit
the
speech
that's
possible
as
you
are
approaching
the
poll.
no
electioneering
by
the
polls.
and
this
court
has
upheld
that
against
first
amendment
challenge,
and
yet
when
they
get
into
the
voting
booth,
this
thing
juts
out
at
them
in
capital
letters,
and
that
somehow
seems
inconsistent
with
our
notion
that
the
voters
should
not
be
bombarded
with
slogans
for
or
against
whatever
issue
when
they
go
into
that
ballot.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
couldn't
we
say
the
dissenter
was
right
on
that
point.
he
said
article
15
and
16.
not
17.1,
as
you
pointed
out.
but
why
wouldn't
it
be
open
to
us
to
say
the
dissenter
was
right
on
that
point?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
particular
argument
wasn't
put
before
judge
bartlett.
it
was
before
the
eighth
circuit.
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
election
clause
was
put
before--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--he
didn't
rule...
bartlett
didn't
rule
on
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
before
you
are
finished,
is
a
threshold
standing
question
with
respect
to
the
initial
plaintiff
here.
in
short,
he
said
in
the
end,
i'm
getting
out
because
of
gephardt,
i
don't
want
to
be
a
competitor
of
gephardt,
so
this
is
beside
the
point
as
to
gralike?
