justice
antonin
scalia
--excuse
me.
and
that
was
shown
on
the
ballot
in
arizona
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
in
most
of
the
south,
until
maybe
25
years
ago,
i'm
sure
the
republican
would
not
have
wanted
his
name
on
the
ballot.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
his
party
affiliation
on
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
any
state
that
requires
you
to
put
your
party
affiliation
on
the
ballot
when
your
party
affiliation
is
not
the
reason
you
are
on
the
ballot?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
other
words,
you
can
get
on
the
ballot
without
a
party
affiliation,
if
you
acquire
enough
signatures,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
state
ballots
have
lines
for
the
major
parties
that
in
the
last
election
got
enough
votes,
so
the
reason
they
show
that
is
they
are
showing
you
why
you
are
on
the
ballot,
and
if
you
are
on
the
ballot
for
some
other
reason,
you
think
they
could
make
somebody
who
got
on
the
ballot
by
popular
referendum
or
signatures,
you
think
they
could
make
him
declare
a
party
affiliation
shown
next
to
his
name?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
haven't
held
that
people
can't
politic.
we
have
held
that
if
a
state
doesn't
want
people
to
politic,
it's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
we
agree
with
some
of
the
reasons
they
gave,
that
is,
that
some
of
the
provisions
are
bad,
but
we
think
that
some
of
the
other
ones
are
good,
why...
we
don't
necessarily
have
to
reach
the
severability
point
ourselves.
why
couldn't
we
remand
and
leave
it
to
the
lower
court
to
decide
the
severability
question
in
light
of
our
disagreement
with
them
that
all
of
the
provisions
they
said
were
unconstitutional
were?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
not
a
legal
command.
i
mean,
if
you
are...
you
don't
have
to
say
it's
binding.
if
it's
a
nonbinding
instruction,
it's
not
an
instruction.
i
mean,
you
can
call
it
an
instruction.
is
that
the
vice
of
this
thing,
misusing
the
word
instruct,
as
opposed
to
advise,
even
though
everybody
knows
and
they
acknowledge
here
that
there
is
no
enforceable
mechanism
on
the
instruct?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
wouldn't
be
the
law.
there
is
no
enforcement
mechanism.
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
one
of
the
problems--
justice
antonin
scalia
not
enforceable.
it's
not
enforceable.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
it
says
instruct.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
mean
advisory.
i
mean,
we
really
mean
it.
we
instruct
you,
but
you
know,
if
you
don't
do
it,
there
is
nothing
we
can
do
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
can
say
he
didn't
take
the
instructions,
if
you
consider
that
to
be
a
violation
of
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
accurate
to
call
it
an
enforcement
mechanism?
i
mean,
usually
you
enforce
laws
by
punishing
people
who
break
them.
you
send
them
to
jail.
you
do
this
or
that.
here,
the
punishment
is
simply
telling
people
that
you
ignored
the
instruction.
is
that
a
punishment?
i
mean,
leaving
aside
the,
you
know,
the
pejorative
manner
in
which
the
announcement
is
made,
if
all
you
are
doing
is
telling
the
people
he
chose
not
to
take
on
instructions.
