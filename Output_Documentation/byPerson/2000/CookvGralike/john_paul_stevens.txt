this
just
applies
to
congress
persons,
though,
doesn't
it?
it
doesn't
apply
to
senators.
justice
john
paul

oh,
it
does.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
view,
could
they,
in
addition
to
what's
in
the
capital
letters,
could
they
add
in
the
following
respects,
and
then
quote
the
paragraphs
that
were
the
failures,
the
basis
for
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
that
refers
to
the
legislature,
too,
and
not
to
this,
not
to
this
process,
the
state
legislature?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
if
you
have
a
minute,
the
court
of
appeals
gave
us
a
whole
bunch
of
reasons
to
come
out
the
way
they
did.
which
one
do
you
think
is
the
strongest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
five
years
ago
in
a
case
known
as
u.s.
term
limits
against
thornton,
this
court
reviewed
an
arkansas
law
prohibiting
the
name
of
an
otherwise
eligible
candidate
for
congressional
office.
from
appearing
on
the
general
election
ballot,
if
he
or
she
had
already
served
two
terms
in
the
united
states
senate
or
three
terms
in
the
house
of
representatives.
we
held
that
the
law
was
an
impermissible
attempt
to
add
qualifications
to
congressional
office,
rather
than
a
permissible
exercise
of
the
state’s
power
under
article
i
section
4,
the
so-called
elections
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.
in
response
to
our
decision
missouri
voters
adopted
an
amendment
to
article
viii
of
their
state
constitution,
designed
to
bring
about
the
adoption
of
a
specified
term
limits
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution.
among
other
things
article
viii
instructs
missouri’s
congressional
delegates
to
use
all
there
powers
to
pass
the
federal
amendment.
it
prescribes
that
the
statement
“disregarded
voter’s
instructions
on
term
limits”
be
printed
on
ballots
by
the
names
of
incumbent
congressional
candidates
who
failed
to
take
certain
legislative
steps
in
support
of
the
proposed
amendment.
article
viii
also
provides
that
the
statement
“declined
to
pledge
to
support
term
limits”
be
printed
by
the
names
of
nonincumbent
congressional
candidates
refusing
to
take
a
term
limits
pledge
to
perform
those
acts
if
elected.
finally
article
viii
directs
the
secretary
of
state
of
missouri,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
to
declare
whether
either
statement
should
be
printed
next
to
a
candidate’s
name.
respondent
gralike
a
nonincumbent
house
candidate
sued
to
enjoin
petitioner
from
implementing
article
viii
on
the
ground
that
it
violated
the
federal
constitution.
the
district
court
granted
gralike
summary
judgment.
the
eighth
circuit
affirmed,
and
we
granted
the
secretary
of
states,
petition
for
certiorari.
petitioner
argues
that
article
viii
is
an
exercise
of
the
people’s
right
to
issue
binding
instructions
to
their
representatives
reserved
by
the
tenth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution.
petitioner
also
contends
that
under
the
elections
clause,
article
viii
is
a
permissible
regulation
of
the
manner
of
electing
members
of
congress.
petitioner’s
first
argument
is
unpersuasive
for
three
reasons;
first
the
historical
instructions
on
which
she
relies
for
her
claim
that
the
states
have
reserved
power
to
issue
binding
instructions
are
distinguishable.
unlike
article
viii
none
of
the
historical
instructions
was
coupled
with
an
expressed
legal
sanction
for
disobedience.
second,
countervailing
historical
evidence
is
provided
by
the
fact
that
the
first
congress
rejected
a
proposal
to
insert
a
right
of
the
people
to
instruct
their
representatives
into
what
would
become
the
first
amendment.
finally
and
of
decisive
significance,
the
means
employed
to
issue
article
viii’s
instructions,
placing
the
equivalent
scarlet
letter,
on
ballet’s
next
to
congressional
candidates
are
unacceptable,
unless
article
viii
is
a
permissible
exercise
of
the
state’s
power
to
regulate
the
manner
of
holding
congressional
elections.
as
we
explained
in
our
opinion
it
is
not.
as
a
fundamental
matter
states
may
regulate
the
incidents
of
congressional
elections,
including
balloting,
only
within
the
authority
delegated
to
them
by
the
elections
clause.
that
is
because
any
state
authority
to
regulate
election
to
congressional
offices
did
not
exist
before
those
offices
were
created
by
the
constitution.
the
elections
clause
grants
to
the
states
the
power
to
regulate
the
times,
places,
and
manner
of
congressional
elections.
while
this
is
a
broad
delegation
of
power
to
prescribe
procedural
mechanisms
for
holding
congressional
elections,
it
does
not
authorize
states
to
dictate
electoral
outcomes
to
favor
or
disfavor
a
class
of
candidates
or
to
evade
important
constitutional
restraints.
contrary
to
petitioner’s
contention,
article
viii
is
not
a
procedural
regulation
concerning
the
manner
of
elections.
the
term
manner
encompasses
matters
like
notices,
registrations,
supervision
of
voting,
and
other
requirements
and
safeguards
that
are
necessary
to
implement
the
fundamental
right
involved.
by
contrast
article
viii
plainly
is
designed
to
favor
candidates
who
are
willing
to
support
its
proposed
term
limits
amendment,
and
to
disfavor
candidates
who
either
oppose
term
limits
in
general
or
would
prefer
a
different
proposal.
to
give
teeth
to
article
viii’s
instructions,
its
labels
impose
substantial
political
risks
on
candidates
who
fail
to
comply
with
its
provisions,
handicapping
them
at
the
most
crucial
stage
in
the
electoral
process,
the
instant
before
the
vote
is
cast.
moreover
by
directing
the
citizen’s
attention
to
the
single
consideration
of
the
candidate’s
fidelity
to
term
limits,
the
labels
imply
that
the
issue
should
be
the
paramount
consideration
in
the
citizen’s
choice.
article
viii
thus
attempts
to
dictate
electoral
outcomes
and
that
kind
of
regulational
congressional
elections
is
not
authorized
by
the
elections
clause.
accordingly
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
kennedy
joins
the
court’s
opinion
and
has
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
souter
joins
all
but
part
three
of
the
court’s
opinion;
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
parts
one
and
four
and
concurring
in
the
judgment;
the
chief
justice
joined
by
justice
o’connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
