mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
reasonableness
is
the
touchstone
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
court
of
appeals
below,
however,
announced
a
broad
new
rule
that
permits
custodial
arrest
for
any
offense
committed
in
an
officer's
presence
regardless
of
the
nature
of
that
offense.
the
court
of
appeals
in
doing
so
ignores
the
fourth
amendment's
requirement
of
reasonableness.
first,
it
ignores
the
fact
that
a
common
law
at
the
time
of
the
fourth
amendment's
adoption
such
an
arrest
would
not
have
been
lawful.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
mr.
chief
justice,
the
common
law
should
be
considered
because
it
is
our
position
that
the
fourth
amendment
incorporates
the
protections,
the
restrictions
on
arrest
that
existed
at
the
time
of
the
fourth
amendment's
adoption.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
no,
your
honor,
because
it
is
our
position
that
the
fourth
amendment
restricts
the
use
of
custodial
arrest
for
minor
offenses
such
as
this.
if
texas
were
to
increase
the
penalty
for
this
offense,
then
it
would
be
a
different
balancing.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
no,
but
let
me
qualify
that.
it
would
be
a
much
weaker
argument,
one
we
would
lose
the
common
law
argument.
two,
however,
this
court...
we're
well
aware
of
this
court's
respect
for
warrants
and
the
fact
that
interjecting
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
operates
as
a
check.
however,
the
fact
is,
by
requiring
a
warrant,
still
that
would
only
require
probable
cause
and
it's
our
position
that
probable
cause
does
not
sufficiently
balance
the
competing
interest,
although
i
concede
it's
a
much,
it
would
be
a
much
weaker
argument--
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia,
and
for
that
reason
we
say--
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
--because,
your
honor,
it
would
interject
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
who
we
would
hope
would
say
officer
turek,
why
are
you
arresting
this
woman
for
not
wearing
a
seat
belt?
why
do
we
not
issue
a
summons.
why
not
issue
just
a
traffic
citation.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
for
that
reason
i'm
willing
to
concede
that
if
a
warrant
were
obtained,
this
arrest
still
would
be
reasonable.
our
position
is
that
probable
cause,
although
it
works
as
a
balancing
of
the
competing
interest
of
law
enforcement
and
the
individual
in
some
instances,
in
the
setting
before
the
court
and
in
most
traffic
offenses,
it
does
nothing
to
balance
the
competing
interest
of
the
individual.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
justice
o'connor,
i
believe
that
time
would
come
when,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
you're
alluding
to
nonappearances,
the
repeat
offender.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
okay.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
without
the
nonappearance
problem.
what
that
raises
is
it's
the
distinction
between
punishment
and
enforcement.
punishing
the
repeat
offender
is
not
the
role
of
the
police
officer,
that's
the
role
for
a
judge
or
a
legislature
that
has
provided
heightened
penalties.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
well,
your
honor,
the
thing
is,
even
the
repeated,
the
fact
if
there
are
repeated
penalties
and
there
is
no
heightened
penalty,
well
then
the
legislature
has
made
a
determination
that
on
the
balance
that
does
not
regard
that
aspect
of
highway
safety
is
that
sufficient
to
justify
the
intrusion.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
read
that
as
trying
to
encompass
what
this
court
in
its
opinion
issued
last
week
referred
to
as
vehicular
bound
imminent
threats
to
life
and
limb
which
would
be
driving
while
intoxicated,
driving
under
the
influence
of
drugs
or
alcohol.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
in
some
cases.
in
most
cases,
however,
i
believe
that
in
some
jurisdictions
still
first
offense
drunk
driving
there
is
no
jail
time.
so
i
would
still,
we
would
still
argue
it
would
be
reasonable,
because
some
of
those
offenses
driving
intoxicated
and
reckless
driving
amount,
in
essence,
to
breaches
of
the
peace,
they
are
by
their
nature
violent,
they
impose
a
threat.
they
threaten
the
health
and
safety
of
others
on
the
road
directly
and
i
think--
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
--justice
o'connor,
i
think
it
would
be
a
closer
question,
but
i
would
still
defer
to
the
fact
that
if
the
legislature
has
not
increased,
has
not
provided
for
heightened
penalties,
for
repeat
offenders,
repeat
nonuse
of
seat
belts,
that
still
it
is
not
that
limited
category
of
offenses
that
impose
an
imminent
threat
to
life
and
limb
on
the
road.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
no,
your
honor,
and
let
me
explain
why.
one,
states
have
already
provided
for
that
kind
of
situation
in
the
uniform
violator
compact
act
where
if
somebody
does
not
appear,
then
their
license
can
be
revoked
in
that
other
state.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
well,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
the
approach
to
that,
there
already
is
a
way
of
dealing
with
that
and
that
is
if
a
party
does
not
appear,
then
that's
a
separate
offense,
there
is
a
penalty
provided
for
that,
a
warrant
may
be
issued
for
that
person's
arrest,
and
they
are
then
subject
to
punishment
for
that
additional
offense.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
your
honor--
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
--the
problem
that
we--
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
--well,
it
depends...
the
problem
with
that
approach
is
it
leads
to,
and
in
part
what
respondents,
respondents
have
implicitly
made
this
argument
that
this
was
a
brief
arrest.
ms.
atwater
was
helped
into
the
police
car.
what
that
leads
to
is
it's
distinguishing
between
the
degrees
of
the
custodial
arrest,
even
though
once
that
person
is
removed
from
the
scene,
the
safety
of
their
car,
once
under
custodial
arrest,
their
life...
or
excuse
me,
their
liberty
and
property
interests
are
completely
forfeited.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
clear
at
common
law
that
breach
of
the
peace
when
used
in
the
context
of
the
law
of
arrest
referred
to
a
group
of
offenses
that
either
involved
violence
or
the
type
of
conduct
that
would
incite
immediate
violence.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
if
we
look
to,
again
the
decision
of
last
week,
and
other
decisions
of
this
court,
delaware
v.
prous,
i
guess
sitz
would
be
an
example,
there
are
certain
offenses,
in
the
context
of
the
traffic
offenses
where
by
their
very
nature
they
impose
a
grave
risk
of
harm
to
others
on
the
road.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
mr.
chief
justice,
it
would
be
a
much
closer
case
then.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
well,
let
me,
part
of
my
vacillation
is
in...
we
proposed
a
rule,
in
looking
back
at
that,
i
now
wonder,
well,
perhaps
the
correct
approach
would
be
to
rely
exclusively
on
the
common
law.
the
common
law
provided
a
clear
boundary,
breach
of
the
peace,
nonbreach
of
the
peace
and
felonies.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
as
of
the
adoption
of
the
fourth
amendment
which
would
be
1791.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
unless
there
were...
the
answer
would
be
no.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
justice
souter,
i
think
the
correct,
i
believe
the
correct
way
to
look
at
the
nightwalker
statutes
is
this
was
a
time
before
any
lighting,
anybody
that
was
walking
about
in
the
dead
of
night
it
was
reasonable
to
presume
that
that
person
was
a
felon,
until--
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
--well
that
the
person
may
have
committed
a
felon
or
they
were
up
to
no
good.
nobody
walking
about
in
the
dead
of
the
night
in
the
17th
century
was
doing
anything
other
than
contemplating
criminal
acts.
i
think
at
the...
that's
the
way
i
understand
the
nightwalker
statute.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
i
think
justice
kennedy
they
stayed
indoors
because
it
was
too
dark.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
well,
justice
ginsburg,
again,
it
depends
on,
our
case
is
a
core
case,
i
mean
it
falls
under
the
rule
the
common
law
end
of
any
balancing--
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
--yes.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
if
the
line
is
drawn
not
based
on
the
common
law
but
as
we
had
proposed
in
our
brief
the
jailable
versus
fine
only
distinction.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
several
responses
to
that
justice
ginsburg.
first,
in
that
instance,
probable
cause,
if
the
arrest
were
based
on
alleged
child
endangerment
there
probable
cause
would
act
as
a
restraint
because
the
police
officer
to
justify
the
arrest
would
have
to
establish
a
certain
degree
of
certainty
that
the
specific
conduct
was
child
endangerment.
now,
this
was
not
child
endangerment
for
several
reasons,
one,
the
legislature
has
imposed
an
extremely
minimal
penalty,
two,
it's
not
child
endangerment
because
you
are
set...
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
if
we
were
to
call
this
child
endangerment
then
not
using
your
turn
signal
or
perhaps
speeding
or
running
a
red
light,
those
are
just
as
close
to
any
possible
harm
as
not
wearing
a
seat
belt.
there's
a
causation
problem,
in
other
words.
and
most
importantly
is
that
by,
if
we
truly
are
concerned
about
the
welfare
of
the
children,
then
arresting
the
mother
and
taking
the
mother
away
is
inflicting
a
far
greater
harm
on
those
children,
and
it's
doing--
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
--we'd
like
to
think
so
justice
o'connor.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
it
might.
i
mean
the
extraordinary
no
arrest
for
fine
only
offenses
absent
an
articulable
fact
that
explains
why
an
arrest
would
be
justified.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
right.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
justice
breyer,
i
really
do
believe
that
in
the
context
of
traffic
offenses,
and
i'll
explain
a
little
bit
later
why
it's
valid
to
limit
a
holding
or
a
rule
to
traffic
offenses,
it
is
not
all
that
complex
because
there
are
only
a
few
offenses
that...
in
which,
most
of
which
this
court
has
identified
in
other
opinions
where
the
arrest...
where
the
use
of
a
custodial
arrest
would
indeed
further
enforcement,
i
mean,
i
guess
one,
drunk
driving,
driving
while
intoxicated,
reckless
driving,
closer
arguably
the
unlicensed
driver,
although--
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
no,
your
honor,
speeding...
it
would
not
be
reasonable
to
arrest
a
driver
for
speeding
unless
the
speeding
rose
to
the
level
of
reckless
driving.
and
that's
where
you
have
the
same
probable
cause
determinations.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
your
honor,
oh,
justice
stevens,
again,
that
returns
to
the
response
i
believe
i
gave
to
justice
o'connor
or
justice
kennedy
that
in
essence
respondents
seek
a
prophylactic
rule
in
that
we
are
to
cede
discretion
to
arrest
to
police
officers
on
the
chance
that
people
from
another
jurisdiction
are
going
to
run
away
and
not
pay
their
fine.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
but
justice
scalia--
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
--it's...
justice
scalia,
i
think
the
reason
why
it's,
i
mean
if
we're
looking
for
a
bright
line
rule,
the
problem
that
permitting
a
custodial
arrest
in
that
situation
would
lead
to
is,
if
we
say,
okay,
out
of
state
person,
he's
not
going
to
come
back
to
wyoming,
high
risk,
if
you
allow
the
arrest,
then
what
that
means
is
the
person
is
potentially
held
in
custody
before
a
probable
cause--
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
--yes,
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
yes.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
my
understanding
is
there
is
a
deep
divide
in
the
community
regarding
the
issue.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
i
have
three
responses
to
that,
justice
ginsburg.
first,
the
fifth
circuit
clearly
did
not
address
that
issue,
the
en
bloc
majority.
they
explicitly
refrained
from
making
that
determination.
but
second,
even
though,
yes,
it
is
conceivably...
it
would
be
a
tough
hurdle
to
overcome
with
regard
to
officer
turek.
however
the
city
still
is
in
the
lawsuit
and
judge--
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
--my
understanding
is
that
the...
if
it
were
to
be
remanded
back
to
the
fifth
circuit,
if
this
court
were
to
find
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
the
fifth
circuit
majority
never
addressed
that...
those
specific
issues,
but
it
would
still
be
live
against
the
city
based
on
the
finding
of
judge
sparks
that
there
was
a
policy
on
the
part
of
the
city.
the
city
had
this
policy.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
judge
sparks,
judge
sparks
in
the...
i
guess
it
would
be
appendix...
the
third
appendix
basically
stated
that
it
was
a...
a
policy
was
established.
a
policy
was
established,
but
no
constitutional
violation
had
been
established.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
yes,
but
judge
sparks
is
a
good
judge.
and
i
think
part
of
that
resulted
from
the
trial
counsel,
frankly.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
justice
souter,
i've
tried
to
determine
how
big
the
problem
was
by
going
to
the
department
of
justice,
which
of
course
provides
the
most
authoritative
statistics.
unfortunately,
they
don't
address
the
issue.
however,
anecdotally,
there,
you
know...
well,
just
a
few
weeks
ago
we
saw
the
young
girl
arrested
for
not...
for
eating
french
fries
in
the
substation.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
in
the
district
of
columbia,
i
believe.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
i'm
sorry.
it
was
in
the--
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
--and
that's
good.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
well,
justice
kennedy,
all
of
the
tests
provided
by
petitioners
and
their
amici
are
actually
remarkably
similar
in
that
they
all
recognize
that
there
should
be
a
limited
amount
of
discretion
for
those
close
cases,
however,
we
can
carve
out
whether
that
be
through
offenses
that
involve...
of
imminent
threat
of
harm.
or
if
we
call
it
a
breach
of
the
peace.
or
if
we
draw
a
distinction
between
fine
only
and
jailable,
lines
can
be
drawn.
that's
one
point.
to
get
back
to
justice
scalia's
comment
about
the
fear
of
the
problem
of
constitutionalizing
everything,
i
refer
to
justice
story's
comment
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
indeed
an
embodiment
of
the
common
law.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
that's
correct,
justice
scalia--
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
--yes,
but
the
problem--
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
--no.
but
that
is
confusing
punishment
with
enforcement.
deterrence
is
a
justification
for
punishment.
and
police
officers
should
be
enforcing
laws
and
not
punishing.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
robert
c.
de
carli
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court--
what
is
interesting
about
this
case
as
some
members
of
this
court
have
pointed
out,
is
respondents
do
not
defend
the
reasonableness
of
the
conduct
of
the
officer
in
question
here,
instead
they
attack
the
workability
of
potential
rules
and
raise...
and
allege
that
this
is
not
a
recurring
problem.
two
points...
well,
a
third
point
also
they
characterize
decisions
of
this
court
far
beyond
their
holdings.
the
first
point,
the
reoccurrence
problem,
since
certiorari
has
been
taken
by
this
case
and
i
know
this
is
anecdotal,
we
have
received
call
after
call
of
problems
of
this
sort
and
to
limit
it
to
publically
reported
incidents,
just
within
the
past
month,
before
this
argument,
a
dps
officer
arrested
a
passenger
in
a
vehicle,
the
passenger
was
a
17-year-old
boy
with
his
mother,
and
that
boy
then...
the
officer
asked
the
boy,
do
you
have
id?
well
that
boy
lived
in
a
small
town
that
did
not
have
driver's
ed.
he
had
no
driver's
license,
so
that
was
then
used
as
a
justification
for
arrest.
the
arrest
presumably
would
be
one
that
would
not
be
treated
as
a
brief
one.
he
spent
the
night
in
jail
in
a
holding
cell
with
crack
dealers
and
people
accused
of
violent
crimes.
i
submit
that
it
is
a
recurring
problem
and
perhaps
more
on
point,
if
the
conduct
in
this
case
is
condoned,
it
will
be
much
more
likely
to
be
a
recurring
problem.
secondly,
boundaries,
judge
weiner's
boundary
as
some
members
of
the
court
have
suggested
is
just
as
workable
as
the
terry
boundary.
it's
not
going
to
require
a
new
volume
of
any
treatise...
for
one
thing
it's
already
a
couple
pages
in
blackstone,
which
has
been
around
for
some
time.
it's
just
going
to
be
a
footnote.
but
under
either
standard,
no
matter
what
the
standard
is,
if
it's
reliance
on
the
probable
cause,
or,
excuse
me,
reliance
on
the
common
law
rule
or
a
balancing
of
the
competing
interests
or
any
of
the
rules
proposed
by
petitioners
amici,
petitioners
win.
this
was
unreasonable.
and
that
leads
to
the
fact
that
again
they
have
offered
no
explanation
for
why
this
arrest
furthered
any
legitimate
law
enforcement
interest.
finally,
probable
cause
as
the
touchstone,
i
have
not,
i
admit
i
have
not
read
every
fourth
amendment
decision
that
this
court
has
written.
however,
i
have
never
come
across
a
decision
saying
that
probable
cause
and
not
reasonableness
is
the
touchstone
of
the
fourth
amendment.
and
no
decisions
have
held
that
anything
other
than
a
public
felony
arrest...
thank
you.
