chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
99-1408,
gail
atwater
v.
the
city
of
lago
vista.
mr.
de
carli.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
would
the
common
law
be
involved
here
mr.
de
carli
if
texas
law
says
otherwise?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you're
arguing
here
that
this
offense
should
not
have
led
to
a
custodial
arrest,
now
as
part
of
that
argument
has
to
be
a
condition
of
texas
law,
isn't
it?
i
mean
if
texas
law
had
authorized
a
custodial
arrest
for
this,
wouldn't
your
case
be
different?
if
you
conceded
that
it
authorized
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
that
be
a
magistrate's
prerogative
ordinarily?
isn't
it
a
magistrate's
prerogative
to
find
probable
cause.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say...
go
ahead--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
de
carli,
a
moment
ago
you
said
you
thought
perhaps
reckless
driving
might
be
a
breach
of
the
peace.
is
that
a
term
of
art,
breach
of
the
peace?
the
briefs
indicate
that
there's
considerable
differences
to
what
it
meant
at
common
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opposing
briefs
suggest
differently.
but
i
recognize
also
that
your
briefs
also
have
supporting
authority.
i'm
just
not
sure
whether
that's
too
happy
a
distinction.
what
should
turn
on
breach
of
the
peace
which
is
basically
a
common
law
concept.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
texas
here
had
said
that
this
particular
offense
was,
you
know,
that
it
could
be
10
days
in
jail
or
300
fine?
could
the
officer
have
done
what
he
did
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
answer...
answer
yes
or
no
and
then
explain.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
speeding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
what.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
de
carli.
mr.
george
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
george.
mr.
taylor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
correct.
thank
you.
mr.
de
carli,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
de
carli,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-1408,
atwater
verus
the
city
of
lago
vista
will
be
announced
by
justice
