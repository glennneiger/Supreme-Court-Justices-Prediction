mr.
andy
taylor
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
court's
teachings
has
been
clear
that
warrantless
arrests
of
traffic
offenders
based
on
probable
cause
is
reasonable,
and
is
a
reasonable
intrusion
under
the
fourth
amendment.
the
court
has
taught
us
that
in
robinson,
in
gustafson,
in
wren,
and
in
knowles,
because
the
question
from
the
constitutional
perspective
is
whether
or
not
probable
cause
to
believe
an
arrest
under
that
local
law
has
occurred,
and
once
that
is
met,
then
all
the
other
questions
become
policy
judgments
that
the
50
states
should
decide.
mr.
andy
taylor
the
reason
why
that
premise
is
incorrect
justice
stevens
is
this
court's
teachings
in
gerstein
v.
pew
and
reaffirmed
in
county
of
riverside
v.
maclaughlin,
once
you
have
probable
cause
this
court's
teachings
have
been
not
only
can
you
engage
in
a
full
custodial
arrest,
but
likewise
you're
entitled
for
a
temporary
detention
for
the
purpose
of
administrating
the
paperwork
so
that
this
individual
can
be
booked
and
then
released
once
a
probable
cause
determination
has
been
made
by
a
magistrate.
this
court
has
rejected
the
notion
that
there
must
be
some
second
reason
based
on
some
mini
trial
based
on
the
facts
presented
as
to
whether
or
not
that
decision
of
that
tree
to
bring
into
custody
is
appropriate.
all
three
options
to
a
police
officer
are
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
the
first
is
to
issue
a
warning,
whether
it
be
in
writing
or
oral.
second,
to
actually
arrest
and
bring
into
custody,
or
third
to
issue
a
citation
instead
of
actually
engaging
in
a
full
custodial
arrest.
this
court
has
taught
us
that
all
three
options
are
equally
reasonable
under
the
floor,
the
minimum
guidelines
and
protections
that
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
federal
constitution
give,
and
then
it
becomes
a
matter
of
policy.
mr.
andy
taylor
there
is
no
constitutional
standard,
it
is
a
policy
judgment
justice
stevens,
and
the
different
states
have
approached
it
in
different
ways.
as
you
will
note
some
of
the
amici
here
have
said
that
it's
appropriate
under
state
law
to
engage
in
a
full
custodial
arrest.
indeed,
if
arguing
whether
or
not
the
state
governmental
interest
is
one
that
should
be
given
credence
by
this
court,
the
state
of
texas
has
spoken
in
the
statute,
even
though
the
statute
in
question,
the
seat
belt
offense
law
does
not
provide
for
punishment
in
the
form
of
jail
time.
they
have
likewise
determined
that
it
is
appropriate
to
have
a
full
custodial
arrest
in
order
to
enforce
the
government's
interest
in
that
particular
law.
therefore,
that
jurisdiction
has
made
that
policy
choice.
those
policy
choices
are
subject
to
political
accountability.
mr.
andy
taylor
the
traffic
rules
of
the
road
is
a
certain
codification
of
state
law
that
includes
seat
belt
offenses
and
there
is
a
statute
in
texas
on
the
books
that
says
for
any
offense
in
this
traffic
code,
full
custodial
arrest
is
appropriate,
save
two
exceptions,
one
is
for
speeding,
and
two
is
for
the
open
container
law
which
were
the
results
of
political
judgments
made
in
the
local
jurisdiction.
other
states
have
decided
that
in
certain
circumstances
they
will
allow
the
issuances
of
citation
rather
than
a
full
custodial
arrest
based
on
the
circumstances
presented
to
that
officer,
and
he
has
that
discretion
to
make
that
judgment
call.
but
if
he
picks
wrong
in
the
view
of
the
folks
that
have
to
review
it
later,
in
other
words,
we
don't
think
he
made
the
best
decision
among
all
of
his
options,
so
long
as
those
options
are
equally
reasonable
under
the
federal
constitution,
then
that
mistake
does
not
drive
a
constitutional
decision
of
reasonableness
because
you
can't
put
that
in
front
of
the
decision.
and
so,
whereas
here,
the
commission
of
an
offense
witnessed
personally
by
the
police
officer
gives
rise
to
probable
cause
then
the
constitutional
inquiry
ends
and
the
policy
judgments
and
decisions
will
begin.
and
that's
why
it
would
be
unworkable
as
this
court
in
several
questions
has
asked
whether
or
not
we
can
draw
lines
between
fine
only
and
jailable
time.
in
fact,
in
welsh
v.
wisconsin,
one
of
those
offenses
in
that
case
was
for
dwi,
but
under
that
jurisdiction's
law
it
was
only
for
jail...
for
a
fine.
similarly,
in
united
states
v.
watson,
when
dealing
with
the
prohibition
cases,
that
particular,
actually...
carroll
v.
united
states,
that
particular
case
dealt
with
bootlegging,
and
that
was
a
misdemeanor
fine
only
offense.
you
cannot
determine
the
constitutional
question
based
on
the
penalty
that
is
associated
with
a
crime,
but
rather
based
on
whether
or
not
there
is
an
offense
for
the
specific
facts
that
have
occurred.
if
we
let
the
penalty--
mr.
andy
taylor
--that's
correct.
mr.
andy
taylor
to
my
knowledge--
mr.
andy
taylor
--i
meant
the
former
and
not
the
latter.
but
the
point
is,
justice
scalia,
your
question
demonstrates
that
these
decisions
well,
under
these
circumstances
what's
the
best
policy
choice
is
just
that,
a
policy
choice
and
not
part
of
the
constitutional
rubric
of
the
fourth
amendment.
those
extra
protections
are
for
the
state's
to
decide.
but
the
minimum
guarantees
of
liberty
in
the
fourth
amendment
are
for
this
court
to
decide,
and
i
would
submit
that
this
court
has
made
it
very
clear
that
the
decision
must
be
pledged
and
looked
to
in
terms
of
probable
cause.
mr.
andy
taylor
i
do
not,
your
honor,
and
the
record
does
not
indicate
why.
one
hypothetical
suggestion
could
simply
be
that
the
federal
courts
would
be
well
equipped
to
know
the
differences
between
the
federal
constitutional
floor
and
the
policy
ceiling
lights
that
the
states
may
accord
on
situations
such
as
this.
but
clearly
whereas
here
probable
cause
existed,
then
there
was
no
constitutional
infirmity,
and
this
court
has
rejected
time
and
time
again
in
berkimer,
and
in
united
states
v.
robinson
and
other
cases,
that
we
cannot
allow
the
punishment
rather
than
the
conduct
to
give
rise
to
the
constitutional
infirmity
or
lack
thereof,
because
otherwise
we're
going
to
have
conduct
which
in
one
state
will
result
in
an
unconstitutional
situation,
and
in
other
state
a
constitutional
one.
and
we
cannot
have
a
rule
which
differs
all
fifty
jurisdictions.
mr.
andy
taylor
justice
souter,
no,
the
fact
that
you
do
not
draw
a
line
is
why
it
doesn't
matter
whether
they're
felonies
or
misdemeanors
or--
mr.
andy
taylor
--yes--
mr.
andy
taylor
--you
would
have
to
have
a
warrant,
absent
probable
cause.
mr.
andy
taylor
well,
even
where
a
warrant
may
be
desired
this
court
has
not
stated
as
a
matter
of
fourth
amendment
principles
that
a
warrant
is
required
in
all
circumstances,
gerstein
says
an
on
the
scene
assessment
by
a
police
officer
of
probable
cause
is
enough
under
our
constitutional
interpretations
of
the
fourth
amendment.
and
then
it
would
be--
mr.
andy
taylor
--yes,
in
certain
circumstances
a
warrantless
arrest
would
not
be
appropriate
because
there's
not
probable
cause.
but
that's
the
touchstone.
if
there's
probable
cause,
then
the
arrest
is
appropriate
in
all
circumstances.
in
wren
v.
united
states,
this
unanimous
court
held
that
the
balancing
test
of
the
government
and
the
individual
is
when
a
probable
cause
exists
always
tipped
in
the
constitutional
scale
for
the
government.
and
then
only
in
extraordinary
circumstances
like
warrantless
intrusions
into
homes
or
serious
bodily
injure
or
deadly
force
do
we
then
have
any
additional
concerns.
in
knowles
v.
iowa
this
court
made
clear
that
what
carried
the
day
in
that
case
was
that
they
hadn't
actually
arrested
the
individual.
i
understand
mr.
chief
justice
my
time
is
up.
