justice
antonin
scalia
even
with
a
warrant
you
couldn't
do
a
custodial
arrest?
justice
antonin
scalia
see,
my
problem
is
with
your
common
law
argument
because
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
contain
a
warrant
requirement,
it
just
says
if
you
do
have,
get
a
warrant,
it
has
to
be
based
upon
probable
cause,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
but
the
only
root
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
that
the
arrest
be
reasonable.
you're
telling
me
that
you
could
do
arrests
at
common
law,
so
long...
at
least
so
long
as
there
was
a
warrant.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
a
warrant
make
it
more
reasonable?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
a
standard
rule
for
policemen
to
stop
motorists
and
state
if
you're
from
out
of
the
jurisdiction
you
either
pay
the
fine
now
or
follow
me
to
the
courthouse.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
quite
sure
that's
standard
procedure
in
any
number
of
states.
and
you
say
that's
all
bad,
you
just
have
to
say,
well,
hope
you
come
back
to
wyoming
someday.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
hate
to
constitutionalize
all
this
thing,
everything
becomes
a
constitutional
case.
is
there
a
police
chief
in
lago
vista?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
he
elected?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
his
constituents
think
it's
a
good
idea
for
his
officers
to
arrest
women
for
not
having
their
kids
in
seat
belts.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
judge
made
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
immerses
himself
in
these
briefs.
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
about
deterrence?
don't
you
think
people
are
going
to
be
pretty
unlikely
to
eat
french
fries
on
the
subway
in
washington.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
maybe
in
lago
vista,
not
to
belt
up
their
kids?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
is
that
worth
nothing?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
that
a
proper
articulable
rule...
do
you
think
that
an
acceptable
articulable
reason
is
that
there's
a
breach
of
the
peace
in
the
more
narrow
sense?
you
know,
the
guy's
really
annoying
people
and
getting
boisterous
and
what
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
i
mean
it
seems
to
me
you
don't
necessarily
have
to
take
him
in
to
stop
that.
you
could
go
over
and
tell
him,
you
know,
you
got
a
fine
and
if
you
do
it
again
you're
going
to
get
another
fine.
that
might
shut
him
up
right
away.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
your
only
reason,
mr.
george,
just
that
you're
willing
to
argue
this
out
on
a
case
by
case
basis?
i
thought
part
of
your
argument
was
that
when
it
says
unreasonable
seizures
in
the
constitution
it
has
something
in
mind
and
doesn't
leave
it
up
to
this
court
to
sit
back
and
decide
what's
reasonable
and
unreasonable.
i
thought
your
argument
was
based
on
the
fact
that
this
has
never
been
understood
to
be
the
constitutional
rule.
there
has
always
been
authority
for
the...
for
policemen
to
conduct
arrests
of
this
sort.
justice
antonin
scalia
which,
if
they're
abusive,
the
sheriff
won't
get
reelected.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
you
put
that
as
your
first
line
of
defense
and
then
argue
on
the,
you
know,
on
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
answer
is,
if
you
don't
know,
you
have
no
articulable
reason.
that's
the
answer.
that's
easy.
if
you
don't
know,
you
don't
arrest.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know,
but
in
that
instance
why
can't
the
officer
just
radio
in?
we
have
john
doe,
he's
intoxicated,
does
this
guy
have
a
record?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
you're
going
to
have
the
same
problem
when
he
goes
before
the
magistrate
in
this
little
town.
they
still
don't
know
anything.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
they
be
held
for
48
hours
as
other
arrestees
can
or
do
they
have
to
be,
do
you
acknowledge
that
that's
part
of
your
rule
that
he
really
does
have
to
be
brought
before
a
magistrate
immediately.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
to
think
it's
fine
to
think
it's
not
unconstitutional,
do
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
a
lot
of
really
stupid
things
that
aren't
unconstitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
set
forth
specifically
in
the
seat
belt
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
that
misdemeanor
violators,
traffic
violators,
seat
belt
and
all
that
stuff,
french
fries
eaters,
unlike
felons,
they're
probably
not
a
discreet
and
into
a
minority,
are
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
they're
a
lot
of
them
out
there.
i
myself
have
never
been
guilty
of
any
misdemeanors.
but
i
am
told
that
there
are
a
lot
of
people
out
there.
and
so
you
can
probably
expect
the
political
system
to
be
able
to
protect
that
category
a
lot
better
than
you
can
expect
them
to
protect
felons.
is
this
sheriff
still
in
office,
do
you
know?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
you
say
he's
been
dismissed,
i
assume
that
means
he's
been
dismissed
from
the
case.
