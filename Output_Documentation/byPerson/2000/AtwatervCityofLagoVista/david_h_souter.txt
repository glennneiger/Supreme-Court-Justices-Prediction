justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
make
of
the
nightwalker
statute
argument
that
at
the
same
period
in
which
you're
arguing
there
was
at
least
a
threshold
of
immunity
set
here,
it
was
clear
in
english
law
that
nightwalkers
who
were
not
breaching
the
peace
in
your
sense
could
be
arrested.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
the
fact
that
the
person
was
a
felon,
even
that
he
intended
to
commit
a
felony,
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
assume
that
i
don't
find
it
conclusive.
one
of
the
things
that
i
would
like
to
know
more
about
if
we
have
to
engage
in
a
reasonableness
determination
here
in
setting
a
standard,
is
how
bad
the
problem
is
out
there.
and
one
of
the
things
that
i
know
both,
i
forget
whether
it's
from
your
brief
or
from
the
brief
on
the
other
side,
in
a
number
of
jurisdictions
in
which
arrests
for
misdemeanors
without
any
distinction,
and
arrests
for
even
the
more
minor
offenses,
some
states
called
them
violations,
the
submisdemeanor,
but
technically
criminal
offenses,
is
permitted
without
warrant
if
committed
in
the
officer's
presence.
and
the
commonness
of
the
practice
leads
me
to
question
how
many
horrible
cases
like
this
one
are
there
out
there?
are
we
faced
with
a
case
in
which
the
facts
indeed
are
about
as
good
for
you
as
i
think,
you
know,
they
could
be,
but
are
we,
by
the
same
token,
faced
with
a
case
which
is
very
rare
and
should
not
be
the
basis
for
constitutionalizing
a
general
rule?
how
big
is
the
problem.
justice
david
h.
souter
where
did
we
see
this?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
hadn't
seen
it
myself.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
didn't
see
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
burden
is
on
the
officer
to
be
certain
that
it
is
the
second
offense
or
the
third
offense,
whatever
is
necessary.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
george,
one
of
your
arguments
is
the
difficulty
of
administration
argument,
and
you
said
earlier
that
when
we're
dealing
with
a
level
of
offense
in
which
it
may
be
difficult
to
tell
on
the
side
of
the
road
whether
this
would
be
subject
to
arrest
or
not
subject
to
arrest,
the...
in
effect
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
should
be
given
to
the
officer
and
we
shouldn't
come
up
with
a
rule
that
in
effect
would
penalize
the
officer.
but
why
should
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
be
given
to
the
officer?
why
should
the
burden
of
uncertainty,
if
we're
going
to
draw
a
line,
be
a
burden
that
falls
on
the
police
rather
than...
a
burden
that
falls
on
the
citizen
rather
than
on
the
police?
why
would
she
make
that
choice?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
realize
that.
but
you
were
making
a
different
argument
when
you
addressed
the
possibility
of
drawing
the
line
differently,
your
response
to
that
was
that
may
be
difficult
in
some
cases,
and
the
burden
of
that
difficulty
should
not
fall
on
the
police.
and
my
question
is,
assuming
a
different
line
were
to
be
drawn,
why
should
the
burden
fall
on
the
citizen
rather
than
the
police?
why
shouldn't
we
simply
say,
look,
if
it's
going
to
be...
if
there's
any
question
about
applying
this
line,
we'll
assume
that
the
burden
of
doubt
should
be
for
the
benefit
of
the
potential
arrestee
rather
than
for
the
benefit
of
the
police?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
the
premise
of
the
question.
we're
assuming
that
the
reasons
would
be
hard
to
articulate.
but
assume
that
we
feel
there
is
a
need
on
reasonableness
grounds
to
draw
such
a
line,
why
isn't
the
answer
to
the
uncertainty
of
application
the
answer
that
was
suggested
earlier,
and
that
is
if
the
police
are
not
certain
in
applying
this
rule,
that
they
have
a
right
to
arrest,
they
should
not
arrest,
and
that's
the
answer
to
the
uncertainty
problem.
justice
david
h.
souter
well
you
have
that
now
on
the
felony/misdemeanor
distinction.
felonies
differ,
some
states
classify
them
as
misdemeanors,
some
classify
certain
offenses
as
felonies.
it
depends...
on
your
theory,
that
would
make
a
difference
in
whether
there
could
be
an
arrest
without
a
warrant.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
draw
a
line
on
the
warrant
requirement,
i
assume
you
accede
to
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you've
got...
so
you've
got
a
variation
from
state
to
state,
even
under
the
scheme
that
you
would
advocate.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
the
officer
is
not...
the
point
is
that
when
an
arrest
is
made
for
an
offense
that
is
not
committed
in
the
officer's
presence,
then
a
warrant
is
going
to
be
required
depending
on
the
gravity
of
the
offense,
and
i
presume
that
is
true
under
the
system
that
you
advocate.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
texas
state
law
makes
it
a
misdemeanor,
punishable
only
by
a
fine,
for
a
front-seat
passenger
in
a
car
equipped
with
seatbelts
to
fail
to
wear
a
seatbelt
or
for
the
driver
of
such
a
car
to
fail
to
secure
any
small
child
riding
in
front.
texas
law
further
authorizes
the
warrantless
arrest
for
anyone
found
violating
the
seatbelt
provisions,
although
it
permits
police
to
issue
citations
in
lieu
of
arrest.
in
march
of
1997,
a
lago
vista
police
officer
stopped
the
petitioner
gail
atwater
for
violating
the
seatbelt
law.
after
upbraiding
atwater,
the
officer
arrested
and
handcuffed
her,
placed
her
in
his
squad
car,
and
transported
her
to
the
police
station,
where
she
was
made
to
remove
her
shoes
and
jewelry
and
eyeglasses
and
empty
her
pockets.
booking
officers
then
took
atwater’s
"mug
shot"
and
placed
her
in
a
jail
cell
for
approximately
one
hour
at
which
time
she
was
released
on
bond.
after
pleading
guilty
to
the
seatbelt
misdemeanor
and
paying
the
$50
fine,
atwater
and
her
husband
filed
suit
alleging
that
the
officer’s
actions
violated
her
fourth
amendment
right
to
be
free
from
unreasonable
seizure.
the
district
court
rejected
atwater’s
claim
and
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
city
and
the
officer
and
the
fifth
circuit
sitting
en
banc
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
court,
we
affirm
and
hold
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
forbid
police
to
make
warrantless
arrest
for
minor
criminal
offenses
like
the
seatbelt
misdemeanor
in
issue
here.
initially
and
we
think
significantly,
there
is
no
historical
basis
for
such
a
limitation.
in
the
years
leading
up
to
this
nation’s
founding
for
example,
parliament
repeatedly
authorized
police
officers
to
make
warrantless
arrest
for
misdemeanor-level
offenses.
the
relevant
american
evidences
to
the
same
effect,
neither
the
history
of
the
framing,
nor
subsequent
legal
developments,
indicate
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
originally
understood
or
has
traditionally
been
read
to
forbid
warrantless
misdemeanor
arrests.
on
the
contrary
for
more
than
200
years
now,
legislatures
have
conferred
warrantless
misdemeanor
arrest
power
and
courts
have
sustained
that
authority
against
constitutional
challenge.
we
will
not
depart
from
that
tradition
today.
further
we
refuse
atwater’s
request
and
mandate
a
new
rule
of
constitutional
law
forbidding
custodial
arrest
when
conviction
could
not
ultimately
carry
any
jail
time
and
the
government
shows
no
compelling
need
for
immediate
detention.
for
reasons
more
fully
explained
in
our
opinion,
we
believe
that
a
standard
requiring
sensitive
case-by-case
determinations
of
government
need,
would
be
difficult,
if
not
outright
impossible
for
officers
in
the
field
to
administer
and
would
result
probably
in
a
crush
of
fourth
amendment
litigation.
we
simply
are
not
convinced
that
there
is
a
sufficiently
serious
problem
of
police
abusing
their
minor
offense
arrest
authority
to
justify
the
development
of
a
new
and
distinct
body
of
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence.
isolated
incidents
can
and
should
be
dealt
with
through
the
normal
political
processes.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens,
ginsburg
and
breyer
joined.
