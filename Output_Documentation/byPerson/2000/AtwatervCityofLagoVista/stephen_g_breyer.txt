justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
do
you
think,
bob,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
strongest
argument
against
you
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case,
it
has
to
do
with
the
police
officers
being
human.
they
say
to
the
police
officer,
look,
if
somebody
commits
a
crime
in
your
presence
you
can
arrest
them.
but
you
can't
use...
do
an
unusual
thing,
you
know,
you
can't
use
excessive
force,
et
cetera,
but
as
long
as
you
behave
in
a
normal
manner,
crime,
you
see
it,
arrest
them.
anyone
can
understand
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
problem
with
your
side
and
the
people
who
are
supporting
it
is
are
they
coming
up
with
something
that
works?
i
mean,
a
policeman
isn't
going
to
know
the
common
law
or
breaches
of
the
peace.
a
police...
they're
just
not
going
to
understand
that.
so
is
there
some
kind
of
practical
alternative
to
this
simple
rule
which
has
in
it
a
way
of
catching
abuses
through
the
nonnormal
behavior.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
if
the
state
does
think
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
their
suggestion
is
there
be
another
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
other
rule
would
be
what
justice
o'connor
just
said.
and
so
my
question
would
be
the
same,
what's
wrong
with
that?
i
thought
frankly
your
answer
to
that
would
be
what
is
the
set
of
arrests
to
which
that
rule
applies.
and
then
i
was
going
to
suggest
the
set
of
arrests
that
are
punishable
by
fine
only.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what's
wrong
with
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
as
long
as
the
officer
has
to
have,
doesn't
the
officer
can
arrest
him
only
if
he
thinks
he's
breaking
the
law.
so
you
say
mr.
policeman,
what
law
was
he
breaking.
and
the
policeman
has
to
understand
that
if
it's
a
law
that's
punishable
by
a
fine
only
he
has
to
have
some
reason
for
arresting
the
person
rather
than
just
citing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
question
is
why
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
absolutely
fine,
if
the
policeman
thinks,
forget
felony/misdemeanor,
i
agree
with
you
that
felony/misdemeanor
is
not
a
workable
rule.
i
don't
know
if
others
do
or
not.
but
felony/misdemeanor
falls
into
the
problem
that
different
states
define
misdemeanor
differently
and
it's
so
complicated
nobody
understands
it.
all
right.
so
that's
why
i
asked
the
rule
that's
been
suggested
by
others,
it's
not
mine
originally,
that
if
it's
punishable
by
a
fine
only
that's
where
justice
o'connor's
principle
kicks
in.
now,
what
would
be
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
by
chance
the
first
line
of
defense
was
breached.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
true,
in
trying
to
think
this
through,
and
i'm
having
a
difficult
time
working
on
this
and
i'm
trying
to
think
it
through,
and
it
seemed
to
me
the
strongest
argument
against
the
weiner
position
is
that
it
would
lead
to
writing
volume
7
of
the
treatise
on
the
fourth
amendment
which
would
have
an
infinite
number
of
rules
in
it
about
when
the
terry
stop
type
justification
is
enough
or
isn't
enough.
and
rather
than
write...
it
seems
to
me
we
ought
to
reserve
that
for
there
being
a
real
problem.
but
is
there
a
real
problem
here?
that's
why
anything
you
could
say
in
respect
to
the,
what
you've
read,
in
doing
research
for
this,
as
to
the
scope
and
nature
of
the
problem
in
general
would
be
helpful
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
you
think
that,
but
i
wondered
if
you've
come
across
some
things
that
you
could
refer
me
to.
