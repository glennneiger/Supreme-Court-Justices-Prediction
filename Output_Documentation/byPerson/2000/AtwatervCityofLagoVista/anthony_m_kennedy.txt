justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--suppose
in
this
case
the
driver
was
from
another
state,
could
there
have
been
an
arrest
made.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
risk
of
nonappearance
is
not
part
of
the
balance
that
you
want
the
police
officer
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--can
a
police
officer
in
an
out
of
state
case
use
the
time
honored
tradition
of
giving
you
a
police
escort
to
the
station
where
you
pay
your
fine?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
a
stop,
it's
a
seizure
of
sorts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
sort
of
an
old
tradition
in
some
of
our
states.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
common
law
as
of
what
date.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
yes
or
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
didn't
have
insomniacs
back
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
a
constitutional
violation
for
a
police
officer
to
be
a
jerk.
and
what
we're
trying
to
do
is
define
whether
there
are
some
rules
that
we
can
work
with.
and
yours
seems
to
me
so
amorphous,
and
the
brief
of
the
respondents
summarized
four
or
five
different
tests
being
given
by
the
amicus
briefs
and
they're
all
different.
and
you're
not
even
clear
that
your
own
tests...
you
say
on
reflection
this
is
adequate--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
judge
weiner's
rule,
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind,
it
only
kicks
in
if
it's
a
fine
only
offense
in
the
first
place,
but
if
there
is
a
reason
such
concern
about
appearance
at
trial,
bingo,
you're
protected.
i
mean
these
situations
do
fall
into
certain
large
categories,
one
is
the
out
of
town
speeders,
you
could
always
haul
him
to
the
station
house,
that's
been
settled
for
years
and
years
and
years
as
justice
scalia
points
out.
but
what
about
those
where
there's
absolutely
no
plausible
reason
for
saying
i
have
to
make
a
custodial
arrest
here.
will
you
give
the
officer
total
absolute
discretion
just
because
he
doesn't
like
the
person
or
something
of
that
nature?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
women
with
small
children.
