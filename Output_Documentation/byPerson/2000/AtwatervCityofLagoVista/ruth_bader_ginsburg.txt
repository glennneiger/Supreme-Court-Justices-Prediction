justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
answered
the
chief
justice's
question
that
if
the
state
had
said
we
regard
not
buckling
up
as
very
serious,
therefore
10
days
in
jail,
then
you
would
have
no
case
to
complain
about
a
custodial
arrest
for
that,
is
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i'm
just
asking
you
the
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
just...
so
a
seat
belt
in
one
state
could
be
one
thing
if
the
state
chooses
to
make
it
a
more
serious
offense,
and
another
thing
in
another
state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now
here
in
this
very
case,
could
the
officer
have
said,
child
endangerment
is
a
felony,
so
it's
not
simply
the
misdemeanor
of
not
buckling
up,
but
you've
put
your
children
in
danger
and
therefore
the
offense
is
child
endangerment
which
is
a
felony.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he's
not
in
the
case
anymore
and
that
raises
another
question,
given
the
division
of
the
judges,
it's
really
interesting,
the
district
court
thought
your
case
was
frivolous
and
then
five
judges
on
the
court
of
appeals
thought
it
was
very
serious.
but
isn't
it
almost
certain
that
this
officer
turek
would
have
qualified
immunity
given...
how
could
one
say
that
the
law
was
clearly
established
given
the
division
among
the
federal
judges.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
police
chief
isn't.
he's
been
dismissed
and
you're
not
challenging
that.
if
you're
relying
on
a
practice
or
policy
of
the
city
to
hold
the
city,
where
would
that
policy
or
practice
have
come
from
other
than
the
police
chief
who
has
been
dismissed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
the
judge
who
thought
the
claim
was
frivolous.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
a
point,
a
procedural
point,
that
i'm
curious
about,
this
case
was
begun
by
the
plaintiffs
in
the
state
court,
and
the
police
officer,
police
chief
and
the
city
removed
it
to
the
federal
court,
is
there
a
reason
why
they
did
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
taylor,
do
you
know
why
local
officials
took
this
case
out
of
the
hands
of
texas
courts
and
put
it
in
the
hands
of
federal
court?
