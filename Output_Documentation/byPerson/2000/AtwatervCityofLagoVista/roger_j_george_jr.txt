mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
problem
we're
facing
on
the
fourth
amendment
has
to
include
both
the
seizure
and
the
scope
of
the
seizure
and
the
nature
of
the
seizure.
and
i
want
this
court
to
pay
particular
attention
to
the
texas
statutory
scheme,
because
the
texas
statutory
scheme
is
remarkable
in
that
in
traffic
violations
particularly,
as
opposed
to
other
kinds
of
violations,
it
provides
very
explicitly
that
once
an
officer
makes
the
decision
to
arrest,
as
opposed
to
giving
a
citation,
that
officer
must
immediately
and
the
word
in
the
statute
is
immediately,
take
the
accused
before
the
nearest
magistrate
and
to
have
that
magistrate
determine
whether
or
not
the
person
should
have
to
put
up
a
bond
or
be
released
on
their
own
recognizance.
that
system
is
exactly
the
system
that
is
in
my
opinion
specifically
authorized
by
this
court's
opinion
in
u.s.
v.
watson,
if
you
read
the
specific
footnote
11
in
that
opinion,
that
is
the
specific
kind
of
procedure
that
was
authorized
by
this
court.
it
has
the
advantages
that
is
the
tradition
in
this
country,
at
least
since
we've
had
automobiles,
that
in
rural
texas,
where
i'm
from,
the
fact
that
you
get...
run
a
red
light
in
el
paso,
and
you're
from
brady,
doesn't...
the
people
in
el
paso
are
somewhat
concerned
that
they'll
ever
see
you
again.
it's
a
little
easier
to
do
something
about
it
in
today's
world
of
computers
and
instant,
relatively
instant
communication.
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
i
believe
the
problem
with
judge
weiner's
appointment
is
the
problem
of
being
too
unclear
as
to
exactly
what
kind
of
reasons
are
good
enough
reasons.
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
it
does
work
in
the
terry
stop
situation
and
we
can--
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
--you
can
argue
it
was
here.
i
mean
this
man's...
if
you
look
at
page
422
of
the
record,
his
police
report
says
i
just
stopped
her
a
few
weeks
ago
for
the
same
violation.
that's
disputed
fact.
but
that's
what
he
articulated.
and
your
concern
about
the
repeat
violators
was
at
least
written
on
the
contemporaneous
repeat
offense
report.
it's
important--
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
--i
understand
that.
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
i
think...
well,
i
think
it
leads
to
the
same
problems
that
we've
had
to
some
extent
in
this
terry
stop
rules.
some
rules,
because
it
has
to
be
coupled
in
my
opinion
with
this
instant
immediate
appearance
before
somebody
else
to
make
the
decision.
in
this
case
judge
thompson
in
lago
vista
agreed
that
some
bond
was
required
here.
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
no.
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
i
absolutely
agree
with
that.
and
i
don't
think
this
court
has,
at
least
if
you
read
u.s.
v.
watson,
new
york
v.
payton,
judge
white,
justice
white's
dissent
in
welsh
v.
wisconsin
concurred
in
by
the
current
chief
justice
all
indicated
as
did
the
american
law
institute's
model
code
referred
to
in
u.s.
v.
watson,
all
provided
that
the
rule
for
arrest
was,
i
see
the
person
do
it,
in
fact
the
ali
rule
was,
i
saw
a
petty
offense
happening
in
front
of
the
officer.
in
this
case,
there
were
five
such
offenses,
driving
without
the
seat
belts,
no
driver's
license--
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
--i
understand.
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
same
reason
that
there's
something
wrong
with
that--
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
--well,
it
assumes
that
the
officer
knows
enough
facts
at
the
time
to
make
a
determination
of
what
the
crime
will
ultimately
be
charged.
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
well,
as
this
court
decided
not
to
adopt
that
rule
in
berkimer.
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
the
answer
is,
because
for
example,
much
conduct
can
be
both
felony
and
misdemeanor.
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
because...
same
reason.
they
don't
know
enough
facts.
for
example,
in
texas--
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
--absolutely.
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
that's
exactly
the
basis
of
my
argument.
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
thank
you
justice
scalia.
returning
to
justice
breyer.
if
the
first
line
is
breached,
let
me
return
to
that
response.
the
problem
is
illustrated
by
public
intoxication
in
texas
as
in
other
jurisdictions.
the
number
of
offenses,
the
times
you
have
done
it
changes
the
penalty.
no
way
to
know
on
the
roadside
whether
this
is
the
first
time
or
the
fourth
time,
if
it
is
the
second
time
in
texas,
you
go
to
jail.
i
mean
it's
punishable
by
jail.
if
it's
the
first
time,
it's
not.
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
yes,
justice
souter,
that...
justice
breyer
asked
me
why...
what's
wrong
with
the
jail
versus
fine
distinction.
and
in
my
view
it
is
to
put
the
burden
on
the
officer
requires
too
much
of
the
officer
and
of
course
i
have
my
first
line
of
defense
again,
that
is,
that
has
never
been--
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
--this
court's
opinion
in
arizona
v.
evans
in
which
the
communications
to
the
station
and
the
computer
system
and
they
called
down
and
they
said
he
has
an
outstanding
warrant
but
it
turned
out
he
didn't
have
an
outstanding
warrant.
the
problem
is
it
assumes
that
in
rural
texas
or
in
other
parts
of
this
united
states
that
there
will
be
effective,
prompt
and
accurate
communication
to--
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
--i
understand.
but
you
have
an
independent
nonadversarial
determination
of
what
the
terms
of
release
ought
to
be,
because
we're
only
talking
about
whether
to
release
people
on
their
own
recognizance
for
appearance
at
trial
as
opposed
to
requiring
some
sort
of
financial
security
for
those
people
to
appear
at
trial.
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
well,
the
discretion
of
the
officer,
the
answer
is
no
there's
not
absolute
discretion
because
there's
the
limits
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
there's
other
kinds
of
constitutional
limitations.
he
can't
go
around
arresting
only
black
people
or
asian
people
or
some
other
kind
of
arrangement,
he
cannot--
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
--not
in
texas,
they
can't.
if
i
were
in
your
shoes
i
would
have
agreed
you
for
this
case
in
county
of
riverside
v.--
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
--in
this
case?
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
on
the
basis,
we're
here
on
a
summary
judgment
where
he
has
never
been
deposed
and
all
we
have
is
arrest
reports.
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
so
the
only
thing
i
have
is
his
arrest
report.
and
on
the
basis
of
his
arrest
report,
he
says
that
he
was...
she
had
violated
the
same
statute
and
he
was
concerned.
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
well,
it
would
be
a
lot
better
that
the
children
have
to
deal
with
having
their
mother
taken
before
the
magistrate
than
having
to
deal
with
the
brain
damage
if
they
had...
she
had
stepped
on
the
brake
five
minutes
later,
five
minutes
later,
would
that
5-year-old
standing
up
in
the
front
seat
of
a
pick
up
and
she
steps
on
the
brake,
it
is
a
very
serious
incident,
even
at
15
miles
an
hour,
assuming
that
was
the
actual
speed.
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
no,
as
i
understood--
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
--being
a
jerk
is
not
unconstitutional.
and
assuming
that
officer
turek
is
a
jerk,
let's
just
give
them
that
position,
and
he
was
a
jerk
in
this
instance,
that
does
not
create
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
no,
there
is
no
real
problem.
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
no.
the
only
things
we
have
come
across
are
the
racial
profiling
issues.
we
have
the
new
jersey
experience
and
we
have
some
of
the
amici
on
the
other
side
presenting
that
problem
to
this
court
and
this
is
a
prophylactic
solution
to
racial
profiling
because
you
never
have
custodial
arrests
for
traffic
violations.
it
is
our
judgment
if
that
is
the
problem,
if
that's
the
only
problem
presented
here,
we
deal
with
that
problem
by
dealing
with
the
equal
protection
violation
it
presents
rather
than
creating,
in
my
opinion,
a
whole
lot
more
work
for
this
court
and
the
lower
federal
courts
on
deciding
what
the
appropriate
standard
would
be
for
this
new
variation
away
from
probable
cause.
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
my
first
response
is
that
probable
cause
has
been
the
line
that's
drawn
on
all
crimes
in
this
country
since
1791.
and
that
is...
ought
to
remain
the
line
because
it
has
worked.
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
the
answer
is,
because
the
difficulty
of
articulating
all
the
reasons
that
would
be
adequate.
now,
we
can
have
a--
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
--truthfully,
i
see
no
reason,
if
you're
going
to
go
down
the
road
of
trying
to
carve
out
some
other
exception
to
probable
cause,
that
the
burden
of
proof
not
remain
on
the
government.
the
burden
of
proof
is...
on
probable
cause
is
that
the
police
officer
has
to
be
able
to...
there
has
to
be
objective
facts
that
would
cause
probable
cause,
a
specific
violation
of
a
specific
statute.
the
terry
stop,
we
put
the
burden
on
the
government.
if
it's
burden
shifting,
if
we're
going
down
this
road,
if
this
court
should
determine
that
there
needs
to
be
a
new
volume
five
for
the
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
and
that
this
is
a
problem
of
some
moment
in
the
country
and
needs
that
remedy,
then
i
can
not
articulate
a
reason
why
we
should
bury
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
roger
j.
george,
jr.
i
wasn't
trial
counsel
at
that
time
and
i
do
not
know
the
reason.
i
agree
with
your
earlier
question
about
qualified
immunity.
i
don't
believe...
i
think
there
is
immunity
both
for
the
city
and
for
the
individuals
here
as
a
matter
of
law.
i
grant
you
that
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
address
that
issue.
but
i
think
this
is
a
largely
academic
exercise
in
here
and
at
this
point,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
mr.
taylor,
thank
you.
