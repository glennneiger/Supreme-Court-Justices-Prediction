what
about
the
situation
of
a
traffic
violator,
maybe
parking
tickets
or
maybe
seat
belt
use,
who
continues
repeatedly
to
refuse
to
use
a
seat
belt
or
to
pay
the
parking
fee
when
parking
a
car
and
has
a
whole
string
of
tickets
for
it?
does
there
come
a
time
when
due
to
the
repeated
nature
and
in
the
case
of
seat
belts
possible
endangerment
of
children
that
the
state
can
say,
okay,
custody
here
is
required,
this
person
just
won't
cooperate?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
possible
that
a
nonappearance
could
amount
to
something
that
generates
jail
time,
but
i'm
just
talking
about
the
repeat
offender.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
without
an
offense
that
requires
jail
time.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
punishment,
a
concern
for
highway
safety.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
notice
that
judge
weiner
in
the
case
below
had
a
suggested
approach,
a
different
approach,
that
when
there's
a
plausible
articulable
reason
for
affecting
such
an
intrusion,
it's
lawful.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
presumably
that
can
generate
jail
time.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
repeated
nonuse
of
a
seat
belt
for
minor
children
constitute
a
threat
to
safety?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
facts
here
are
very
unattractive.
i
mean
one
doesn't
like
to
think
that
a
mother
is
going
to
be
stopped
for
not
wearing
a
seat
belt
and
have
her
children
in
tears
in
the
car
while
the
mother
is
hauled
off
to
jail.
you've
got
the
perfect
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
think
what
we're
concerned
with
is
the
broader
rule
because
it
has
millions
of
permutations
and
applications
across
the
country.
and
conceivably
the
fourth
amendment
at
bottom
does
always
require
a
kind
of
reasonableness
test,
and
that's
why
i
thought
judge
weiner's
approach
might
make
a
little
sense
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
about
like
a
terry
stop,
that's
pretty...
if
there's
a
particular
articulable
reason
to
suspect
there's
a
problem
here
you
can
make
a
terry
stop,
i
don't
see
that
it's
that
different.
that
seems
to
work.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
wouldn't
it
work
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
not
asking
about
this
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
asking
about
an
appropriate
workable
rule.
and
i
want
to
know
why
the
weiner
formulation
in
your
view
is
unworkable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
wasn't
the
decision.
people
can
be
held
a
long
time.
what
happened
to
the
arresting
officer
in
this
case?
do
you
defend
that
as
a
reasonable
decision?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
knowing
it
was
a
mother
with
two
small
children
in
a
small
town
and
what
happens
to
the
children?
i
mean
this
is
kind
of
an
amazing
case,
but
you
think
that's
fine.
