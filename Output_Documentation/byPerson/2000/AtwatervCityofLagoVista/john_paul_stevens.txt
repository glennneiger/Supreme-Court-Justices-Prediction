what
if
the
speeder
if
from
another
jurisdiction?
justice
john

mr.
george,
can
i
just
ask
sort
of
a
general
question,
why
wouldn't
that
interest,
and
obviously
you're
certainly
entitled
to
arrest
somebody
who's
about
to
flee
the
jurisdiction
or
something
like
that,
but
why
wouldn't
that
interest
be
accommodated
by
the
statement
of
justice
weiner,
judge
weiner
in
his
dissent?
there's
got
to
be
some
reason,
any
reason,
as
long
as
it's
plausible
and
relates
to
the
problem.
and
the
reason
there
is
obvious
the
guy
may
not
show
up
to
pay
the
fine.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
george
is
trying
convince
of
us
that
that's
the
reason--
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
suggest
this,
again,
going
back
to,
as
you
can
guess,
i'm
rather
intrigued
with
the
descending
standard.
basically
the
descending
standard
is,
if
the
decision
to
make
a
custodial
arrest
rather
than
citation
is
wholly
arbitrary,
if
there's
no
plausible
reason
or
articulable
reason
can
be
given
for
it,
then
it's
arbitrary.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
anything
is
arbitrary
cannot
be
reasonable
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment.
now
why
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
saying
there
is
no
standard
that
constrains
the
officer's
decision
on
whether
or
not
to
give
a
citation
as
opposed
to
make
a
custodial
arrest.
