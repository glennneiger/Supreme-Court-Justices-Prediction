justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
title
28
u.s.
code
section
2244(d)(2)
is
a
tolling
provision
for
a
federal
statute
of
limitations
for
federal
habeas
petitions.
it
provides
that
the
time
during
which
a
properly
filed
application
for
state
post-conviction
or
other
collateral
review
with
respect
to
the
pertinent
judgment
or
claim
is
pending
shall
not
be
counted
toward
any
period
of
limitation
under
the
section.
and
this
case
presents
the
question,
whether
a
federal
habeas
corpus
petition
is
an
application
for
state
postconviction
or
other
collateral
review
within
the
meaning
of
this
statute?
the
respondent
walker
was
convicted
of
robbery
in
new
york
state
court.
his
conviction
became
final
before
the
april
24,
1996
effective
date
of
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act,
which
we
use
the
acronym
aedpa
to
describe.
respondent
filed
a
federal
habeas
petition
under
section
2254.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
petition
without
prejudice
because
it
was
not
apparent
that
respondent
had
exhausted
his
available
state
remedies.
without
returning
to
state
court
and
more
than
one
year
after
aedpa’s
effective
date
and
the
statute
of
limitations
period,
the
respondent
filed
another
federal
habeas
petition
in
the
same
district
court.
this
time
the
district
court
dismissed
the
petition
as
time
barred
because
respondent
had
not
filed
a
petition
within
a
reasonable
time
of
aedpa’s
effective
date.
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
his
second
petition
was
timely
because
his
first
federal
habeas
petition
had
tolled
the
one
year
statute
of
limitations
period.
the
second
circuit
based
its
decision
on
its
interpretation
of
the
phrase,
“other
collateral
review”
which
it
thought
included
federal
habeas
petitions,
and
there
is
a
conflict
of
authority
among
the
courts
of
appeals
on
this
question.
so,
we
granted
certiorari
and
in
the
opinion
filed
today
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
second
circuit.
our
only
job
in
the
case
is
one
of
statutory
construction
and
under
the
correct
reading
of
the
statute
we
hold
that
the
word
“state”
applies
to
the
entire
phrase
postconviction
or
other
collateral
review.
in
other
portions
of
the
same
aedpa
statute
and
laws
congress
specifically
use
both
the
word
“state”
and
“federal”
to
denote
state
and
federal
proceedings.
in
section
2254(d)(2)
by
contrast
the
word
“state”
is
employed
but
not
the
word
“federal”
as
a
modifier
for
the
phrase.
we
presume
that
congress
acted
intentionally
by
excluding
the
word
‘federal’
in
this
provision,
and
to
read
the
statute
to
include
petitions
for
federal
review
would
render
the
word
“state”
in
significant
if
not
total
surplusage.
we
hold
then
that
the
section
did
not
toll
the
limitation
period
during
the
pendency
of
his
first
federal
habeas
petition.
