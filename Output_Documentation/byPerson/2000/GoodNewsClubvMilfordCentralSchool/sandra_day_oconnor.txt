justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
marcelle,
could
you
clarify
for
us
the
nature
of
the
right
that
you
are
asserting.
now,
could
the
school
district
say
we
are
not
going
to
allow
access
to
any
groups
in
off
school
hours?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
contend
that
the
school
has,
instead
of
doing
that,
opened
a
limited
public
forum
allowing
some
groups
to
use
the
school
in
off
hours?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
the
school
say
only
hours
after
6
p.m.?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
only
certain
days
a
week?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you're
just
seeking
equal
access
on
the
same
terms
that
the
school
offers
it
to
other
groups
to
benefit
the
welfare
of
the
community,
is
that
the
idea?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
a
church
asks
for
privilege
to
conduct
church
services
once
a
week
during
the
hours
the
school
allows?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
if
one
of
the
local
churches
came
in
and
said
we'd
like
to
use
it
one
day
a
week
to
conduct
our
regular
services,
that
would
have
to
be
granted
as
well,
if
it
fell
on
a
day
and
an
hour
when
the
school
said
it
was
open?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
marcelle,
does
state
law
require
this
school
district
to
open
its
facilities
after
school
to
other
groups?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
is
a
decision
made
by
the
particular
school.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
does
not
require
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
it
clear
under
state
law
that
the
school
could
adopt
whatever
provisions
it
wants
for
its
opening
of
the
school?
it
could
choose
to
limit
it
to
athletic
purposes
at
certain
hours
and
on
certain
days?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it
would
be
entirely
open,
whatever
this
court
chose
to
do
for
the
school
to
revamp
its
policy
for
hours
and
days
and
purposes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
now,
what
difference
does
adult
sponsored
make?
i
assume
the
girl
scout
meetings
are
adult
sponsored.
what's
the
purpose
of
emphasizing
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
these
things
are
adult
sponsored.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
equal
access
act
are
you
talking
about?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
new
york
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
are
referring
to
some
new
york
law?
some
federal
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
before
us
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
didn't
think
it
was
presented
to
us
on
that
basis.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
you
don't
say
that
the
school
couldn't
adopt
some
different
policy
and
say
we're
not
going
to
allow
any
use
of
our
buildings
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
state
law
does
not
prohibit
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
school
could
say,
we're
only
going
to
allow
after
school
use
for
athletic
purposes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
we're
only
going
to
allow
it
after
6
p.m..
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah.
it
only
sets
a
ceiling,
whatever
that
state
law
is.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
just
a
minute.
i
thought
we
just
went
over
this.
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
that
prohibits
the
school
from
saying
we're
not
going
to
have
any
activity
before
6
p.m.
or
3:30
or
4:00
or
5:00,
whatever
it
is.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
told
me
the
school
can
do
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
why
would
you
complain
about
3
o'clock?
that
must
be
something
the
school
itself
set
up.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
that's
all
that's
before
us
is
the
religious
worship.
the
school
obviously
can
set
the
hours
and
the
days
and
the
opportunities
for
all
these
groups.
