it
specifically
allows
meetings
and
entertainment
events
and
other
uses.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
a
trial
court,
the
school
district
made
no
distinction
in
its
summary
judgment
motions
or
in
its
answer
based
on
the
fact
that
this
was
immediately
after
school?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
school
district
said
it
could
bar
these,
it
could
bar
these
meetings
at
any
time
of
day?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
made
no,
and
it
made
no
distinction
between
right
after
school
or
an
hour
after
school
or
two
hours
after
school?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
assuming
you
know
what
we
are
going
to
say.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it,
i
take
it
based
on
your
position
it's
open
to
us
to
say
that
it's
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause
for
the
state
to
scan
and
to
review
every
single
event,
every
single
class
in
order
to
purge
it
of
religious
content;
that
that
is
itself
is
an
establishment
violation.
that's
open
for
us
to
say,
so
if
we
said,
that
would
certainly
foreclose
the
line
of
questioning
that,
the
suggestions
that
justice
souter
is
making
about
further
lawsuits.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
not
if
we
rely
simply
on,
on,
on
the
first
amendment
speech
clause.
that,
that's
another
option
that
we
have.
we
say
it's
simply
violative
of
the
first
amendment
speech
clause.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
where
is
that
letter
in
the
record?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
have
you
memorized
the
declaration
of
independence
or
the
preamble
of
the
constitution,
that's
something
other...
what
is
that?
that's
not
thinking?
that's
not
training
of
any
kind?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
not,
that's
not
imparting
a
view
on
what
our
history
means?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we,
we
don't
want
you
to
know...
be
able
to
recite
the
first
amendment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
your
position
is
they
can't
do
it
at
any
time
of
day,
and
that's
the
way
the
case
has
been
presented
to
us
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
defend
that
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
to
prohibit
the
use
of
public
facilities
for
religious
purposes
shows
the
state
is
neutral
as
to
religion,
is
that
your
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
say
this
was
the
high
school
room?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
high
school
and
the
elementary
school
one
facility?
