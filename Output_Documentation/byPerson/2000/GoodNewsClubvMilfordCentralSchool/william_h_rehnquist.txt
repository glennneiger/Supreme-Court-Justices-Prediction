we'll
hear
argument
now
on
number
99-2036.
good
news
club
v.
milford
central
school.
mr.
marcelle.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
but,
i
think
you
can
say
that
the
school,
that
the
school
couldn't
exclude
religious
viewpoints
or
religious
groups
and
still
not
necessarily
say
that
it
had
to
be
open
for
a
full
dress
religious
service.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
court
of
appeals
rely
on
the
establishment
clause
in
its
decision?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
almost
impossible
for
counsel
to
say
what
the
effect
of
an
opinion
is
going
to
be.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
also
principles
of
res
judicata
involved
that
anything
that
was
litigated
or
might
have
been
litigated
in
a
suit
is
barred.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
marcelle.
mr.
miller,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
but
what
are
the
grades
covered
at
the
milford
central
school?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
would
be
unusual,
wouldn't
it,
for
any
meeting
after
school
not
to
have
an
adult
leader?
he
wouldn't
have
a
bunch
of
fourth
graders
in
there
talking
by
themselves.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what,
what
do
you
do
about
the,
our
lamb's
chapel
decision?
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
of
appeals
here
paid
very
little
attention
to
lamb's
chapel.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
but
it
didn't
exclude
discussions
of
morality...
the
boy
scouts,
the
girl
scouts
teach
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
it
really
excluded
was
a
discussion
of
morality
that
had
a
religious
perspective.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
very
oath
of
the
boy
scouts
is
moral.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so
someone
who
spoke
of,
wanted
to
teach
about
how
to
be
a
good
citizen
from
a
particularly,
especially
secular
point
of
view
could
not
have
done
so
under
your
program?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
could
have
done
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
someone
who
wanted
to
speak
about
exactly
the
same
subject
from
a
religious
point
of
view
could
not
have?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
this
is
essentially
a
religious
worship
service.
now,
i
think
people
might
quarrel
with
that.
you
can
have,
i
think
one
of
my
colleagues
here
described
it
as
more
like
sunday
school,
and
i
think
that's
probably
an
accurate
description,
but
it
certainly
isn't
religious
worship
in
the
sense
that
most
people
think
of
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
you
did
litigate
it,
didn't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
would
it
be
a
favoritism?
i
mean,
presumably
if
they
met
the
standards
for,
if
you
have
to
have
a
certain
number
of
people
come
to
the
meeting,
any
religious
group
that
met
that
standard
would
have
been
granted
the
same
right,
wouldn't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
what
you're
saying
basically,
it's
kind
of
a
heckler's
veto,
that
if
people
don't
like
what
the
school
is
doing
and
are
unhappy
about
it,
that
is
a
reason
for
excluding
religion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
miller.
mr.
marcelle,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--this
is
on
rebuttal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
marcelle.
the
case
is
submitted.
