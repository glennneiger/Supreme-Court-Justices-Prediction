mr.
frank
w.
miller
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
before
this
court
today
is
whether
a
public
school
district
may
lawfully
exclude
a
religious
group
from
conducting
adult
led,
adult
sponsored
and
adult
initiated
prayer
and
worship
services
and
religious
instruction
immediately
at
the
end
of
the
school
day
where
these
activities
involved
the
youngest
children.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
the
purpose
of
emphasizing
that--
mr.
frank
w.
miller
--well,
justice
o'connor,
except
for
the
fact
that
we
have
the
equal
access
act
which
we
submit
that
if
petitioner's
position
is
accepted
in
this
case,
the
equal
access
act
will
become
meaningless
because
then
you
will
be
able
to
have
adult
led
and
adult
sponsored
religious
activities
occurring
in
a
school
which
the
equal
access
act
would
prohibit.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
i'm
talking
about
the
equal
access
act
that
was
discussed
by
this
court
in
murgens
and--
mr.
frank
w.
miller
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
frank
w.
miller
yes,
justice
o'connor,
the
federal
statute
known
as
the
equal
access
act.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
no,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
no,
it
is
not.
it
is
that,
it
is
that
the
federal
law
would
allow,
the
equal
access
act
would
allow
adult,
would
not
allow
adult
led
or
adult
sponsored
religious
worship
and
activity
in
a
school
under
any
circumstances.
whereas,
if
it
were
student
initiated
and
student
led
at
the
secondary
level,
that
would
be
permissible
under
federal
law
and
those
restrictions
have
been
upheld
by
this
court
in
murgens.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
kindergarten
through
sixth
grade,
so
it's
actually
ages
5
to
12.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
oh,
absolutely.
oh
absolutely.
absolutely,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
emphasize
that
point
only
because
of
the
fact
that
under
federal
law
under
the
equal
access
act,
this
activity
wouldn't
be
permitted.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
it
would
prohibit
the
activity.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
at
the
elementary
level,
and
it
would
prohibit
the
involvement
of
adult
supervision.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
justice
scalia,
my
understanding
of
the
act
was
that
it
specifically
prohibited
adult
led
and
adult
sponsored
activities
at
the
elementary
level,
which
is
the
situation.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
that's
right.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
right.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
yes,
justice
breyer.
justice
breyer,
we
contend
that
this
is,
and
i
believe
the
parties
have
stipulated
that
this
is
a
limited
open
forum.
and
what
we
have
attempted
to
do
is
consistent
with
state
law
we
have
attempted
to
exclude
the
subject
matter
of
religion.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
well,
the
theory
is,
justice
breyer,
that
we
have
set
limits
to
exclude
on
a
reasonable
basis
certain
activities
from
occurring
in
the
school.
just
as
we
exclude
partisan
political
activities.
we
exclude
commercial
activities.
and
we
exclude
various
other
activities,
the
school
system
has
made
a
decision
that
it
wanted
to
exclude
this
activity
from
its
forum.
now,
consistent
with
a
decision,
for
example,
in
cornelius
vs.
naacp,
where
the
issue
of
partisan
political
speech
was
excluded
from
a
limited
open
forum.
we
have
acted
similarly
in
this
circumstance.
because
of
concern
about
some
of
these
establishments.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
i'm,
i'm
well
aware
of
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
i
think
that
in
part,
and
i,
i'm
not
certain
why
the
second
circuit
wrote
the
majority
opinion
it
did,
except
for
the,
i
can
offer
the
court
this,
and
that
is
that
in
footnote
two
of
the
majority
opinion,
this
court
indicated
very
clearly
that
it
was
not
addressing
the
issue
of
worship
services
and
sunday
school.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
well,
justice
souter,
i
think
perhaps
the
actions
of
the
school
district
have
been
somewhat
mischaracterized.
i
believe
that
there
is
a
letter
in
the
record
from
the
superintendent
that
had
indicated
precisely
what
they
were
excluding,
and
the
letter
from
the
superintendent
to
the
reverend
indicated
that
uses
consistent
with
lamb's
chapel
would
be
permitted,
but
that
religious
worship
would
be
excluded
under
the
description
of
this
forum.
so
it
was
not
excluded
because
of
a
viewpoint.
it
was
excluded
because
the
entire
subject
matter
of
religious
worship
was
excluded
from
the
forum.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
yes,
sir.
your
honor,
please
look
at
the
joint
appendix
h
1
to
h
2.
there
is
reference
there
to
the
lamb's
chapel
decision
of
this
court
indicating
that
the
viewpoint,
the
viewpoint
was...
was
not
what
was
being
excluded,
rather
it
was
the
religious
worship
that
was
being
excluded.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
justice...
justice
souter,
we
advanced
both.
for
example,
an
examination
of
our
answer
would
reveal
that
we
raised
the
establishment
clause
as
an
affirmative
defense.
but
i
believe
it's
the
next
to
the
last
page
of
the
district
court
opinion,
and
i
could
find
it
if
the
court
wishes.
the
district
court,
for
example,
concluded
that
because
we
had
found
that
the
limited
open
forum
was
properly
created
and
properly
limited,
it
did
not
need
to
reach
our
establishment
clause
arguments
or
the
establishment
clause
issue.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
justice
scalia,
yes,
sir,
i
do.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
justice
kennedy--
mr.
frank
w.
miller
--oh,
of
course
it
is.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
we
don't
certainly
contend
that
that
was
a
full
description,
justice
kennedy,
of
everything
that
was
occurring.
rather
we
have
a
full
record
that
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
both
instances
concluded
that
this
was
indeed
religious
worship.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
no,
sir.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
well,
justice
breyer,
the
premise
of
the
question
operates
under
the
assumption
that
the
only
thing
that
we
excluded
was
religious,
were
religious
activities,
i
believe.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
your
honor,
we
have
excluded
the
entire
subject
matter
of
religion
as
we--
mr.
frank
w.
miller
--no,
your
honor,
because
that
is
not,
that
is,
in
fact,
not
the
case
as
this
particular
forum
was
created.
this
particular
forum
also
excluded
partisan
political
speech
and
various
other
activities
that
i
believe
we
enumerated
in
our
brief
and
i
think
are
enumerated
elsewhere
in
the
record,
particularly
the
deposition
of
the
school
superintendent
identifies
a
number
of
those.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
well,
your
honor,
that...
the
facts
in
the
case
really
don't
spell
that
out.
and
in
fact,
there
is
no
development
of
the
record
in
terms
of
what
precisely
the
boy
scouts
did,
other
than
recite
the
boy
scout
motto.
in
fact,
the
record
doesn't
reflect
that
they
actually
held
their
typical
club
meetings
on
school
premises.
what
they
actually
held
on
school
premises
were
leadership
meetings
and
not
actual
cub
scout--
mr.
frank
w.
miller
--yes,
your
honor.
and
our
position
has
been
that
that's
essentially
an
incidental
mention
of
those
issues.
it
is
different
from
or
distinct
from
religious
worship.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
your
honor,
they
could
have.
i
believe
that--
mr.
frank
w.
miller
--yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
i
don't...
i
don't
agree
with
the
chief
justice's
statement
of
the
question.
your
honor,
we
would
have
allowed
them
to
express
their
viewpoint
on
a
secular
subject,
i
believe
consistent
with
lamb's
chapel.
we
would
not
have,
however,
permitted
religious
worship
services,
which
is
essentially
what
this
was.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
well,
except
for
the
fact,
your
honor...
your
honor
that
the
sunday
school
is
generally
the
way
that
religious
worship
is
presented
to
children
of
this,
of
this
age
group.
they
are
typically
not
required
to
attend
the
full
service
and
so
forth.
they
typically
attend
a
sunday
school
type
service.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
well,
justice
scalia,
they
go--
mr.
frank
w.
miller
--no.
justice
scalia,
except
for
the
fact
that
what
they
do
is
that
they,
they
engage
in
an
activity
that's
age
appropriate,
and
for
those
children--
mr.
frank
w.
miller
--yes,
sir,
they
do.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
it
does.
i
believe
it's
very
much
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
religious
worship
would
be
excluded,
justice
scalia.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
justice
scalia--
mr.
frank
w.
miller
--i
wouldn't
necessarily
say
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
well,
i...
the
point
i'm
getting
across
is
that
the
activities
of
the
good
news
club
were
more
than
merely
reciting
one
prayer.
there
was
much
more
involved
in
that
which
is
fully
developed
in
the
record,
and
those
activities
were
much
more
religious
and
much
more
in
the
nature
of
a
religious
worship
service.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
justice
scalia--
mr.
frank
w.
miller
--justice
scalia,
for
children
of
this
age
group,
that
is
the
religious
worship
service
that
they
would
typically
engage
in.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
i'm
hoping
we
don't
lose
this
case,
justice
souter.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
i
believe
that
we've
preserved
it
and
fully
developed
the
record
with
respect--
mr.
frank
w.
miller
--except
for
the
fact,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
it
was
not
ruled
on
specifically.
the
district
court
said
because
we've
concluded
that
your
limited
open
forum
was
constitutional
under
second
circuit
precedent,
we
didn't
need
to
reach
the
establishment
clause
argument.
it
was
raised.
it
was
not,
however,
ruled
on
previously
by
the
district
court.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
well,
several
ways.
number
one,
i
think
that
even
if
it's
not
a...
technically
an
establishment
clause
violation,
i
think
the
school
district
had
a
reasonable
basis
to
conclude
that
it
might
potentially
be
disruptive,
it
might
potentially
be
divisive
of
the
community
to
allow
this
type
of
utilization
of
the
school
building,
and
out
of
concern
that
perhaps
religions
which
did
not
predominate
in
the
area
might
be
unrepresented
and
unable
to
use
the
school
facility
for
similar
purposes.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
frank
w.
miller
--presumably,
if
you
ordered
it.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
well,
actually,
your
honor--
mr.
frank
w.
miller
--actually
it
isn't
terribly
divisive,
justice
scalia.
what
we
are
concerned
about
is,
is
that
there
may
be
religious
groups
that
do
not
have
a
substantial
representation
in
this
small
town
community,
and
that
the
majority
religion,
such
as
reverend
fournier
represented
would
be
able
to
run
a
good
news
club,
but
the
other
groups
that
didn't
have
the
numbers
or
the
personnel
couldn't
run
a
similar
club,
and
that
would
show
a
favoritism
to
this
particular
club.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
yes,
sir.
but
it's--
mr.
frank
w.
miller
--i
don't
believe
that
to
be
the
only
basis
upon
which
we've
determined
that
it
is
appropriate
to
exclude
this.
we
have
also
relied,
to
some
extent,
upon
the
mandate
of
state
law
that
the
school
is
bound
to
follow,
and
may
i
point
out,
please,
that
in
the
complaint
there
is
no
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
section
414
of
the
education
law.
that
relief
was
not
asked
for
at
the
district
court,
it
was
not
asked
for
at
the
court
of
appeals,
and
it
is
not,
in
my
judgment,
at
least
from
what
i
read
in
the
complaint,
it
is
not
before
this
court.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
justice
stevens,
i
believe
that
that's
essentially
what
the
state
statute
mandated.
the
state
statute,
education...
new
york
education
law
414
prohibited
use
of
a
school
building
for
religious
purposes.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
that
is
correct,
except
one
of
the
things
that
they
do
not
permit,
along
with
other
prohibitions,
such
as
a
political...
partisan
political
activities,
commercial
activities,
and
so
on.
one
of
the
other
excluded
areas
is
a
religious
activity.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
yes,
sir.
just
as
you
were
in
lamb's
chapel,
but
the
same
statute
was
before
the
court
in
lamb's
chapel,
and--
mr.
frank
w.
miller
--yes.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
at
the
elementary
level.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
my
understanding
is
it
was
a
very
vigorous
debate
about
whether--
mr.
frank
w.
miller
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
the...
we
contend
that
the
establishment
clause
argument
is
very
much
involved
in
this
case.
we
did
raise
that
as
an
affirmative
defense
in
our
answer,
and
we
contend
that
if
this
particular
use
is
permitted,
we
will
have
sunday
school
on
a
tuesday
in
a
public
school
occurring
at
3
o'clock
immediately
upon
the
end
of
the
official
school
day.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
the
school
can
do
that.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor,
it
is
something
that
the
school
set
up
and
allows,
but
they
didn't
specify
specific
times,
and
when
they
examined
this
particular
circumstance,
they
determined
that
it
was
religious
worship
and
chose
not
to
exclude
it...
or,
excuse
me,
chose
to
exclude
it.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
that
is--
mr.
frank
w.
miller
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia,
the
original
denial
was
based
on
the
fact
that
it
was
religious
worship,
not
based
upon
the
specific
time
of
day,
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
yes,
sir,
i
do.
i
believe
we
have
the
right
to
limit
the
forum
to
certain
activities
that
the
school
believes
have
a
reasonable
basis
consistent
with
the
mission
of
the
school
system,
and
under
the
circumstances,
as
they
have
excluded
other
activities,
such
as
political
activities
and
commercial
activities
and
similar
activities,
they
are
permitted
to
exclude
these
activities
as
well.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
correct.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
because
under
those
circumstances
that
you
just
posit,
i
believe
that
the
school
is
then
lending
support
to
a
particular
religious
exercise
or
a
particular
religion.
under
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
case,
our
case,
we
have
an
increase
in
active
attendance
at
the
meetings,
we
have
the
school
being
utilized
in
effect
as
a
church.
and
the
same
activity
was
conducted
only
months
earlier
at
the
church.
and
under
the
circumstances,
we
submit,
to
permit
the
utilization
for
a
church
service,
for
a
worship
service,
would
involve
the
school
in
endorsing
and
supporting
the
that
particular
religion.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
uh
huh.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
the
example
of
the
crossing
guards
you
gave,
i
presume,
is
on
a
public
street.
that
would
be
an
open
forum
where
restrictions
and
limitations
would
be
very
difficult
to
justify.
in
the
case
of
a
limited
open
forum,
such
as
the
school
district
where
you've
previously...
this
court
has
previously
indicated
we
have
to
have
special
sensitivity
to
the
age
and
so
forth
of
the
children,
we
believe
that
it's
appropriate
to
make
those
judgments
to
exclude
from
the
forum
those
activities
that
the
school
officials
may
believe
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
mission.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
well,
they
wouldn't...
if
they
were
doing
it
for
a
for
profit
purpose
under
new
york
law,
that
wouldn't
be
permissible.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
well,
no,
no,
it
wouldn't
be
a
permissible
use
was
my
point.
it
would
not
be
permitted
under
the
school
use
policy
or
under
new
york
education
law
414.
it's
simply
not
permitted.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
justice
kennedy,
i
believe
that
we
are
required
to
be
neutral
and
permit
the
schoolhouse
to
be
used
as
a
house
of
worship
would
violate,
i
believe,
the
principle
of
neutrality.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
is
justice
souter's
question
in
reference
to
this
specific
record
or
is
this
a
hypothetical?
mr.
frank
w.
miller
because
you
would
be
permitting
then
a
schoolhouse
to
be
used
as
a
house
of
worship.
in
the
case
of...
in
our
particular
case,
at
3
o'clock
there
are
lots
of
other
educational
activities
going
on.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
well,
justice
souter,
i
believe
that
widmar
is
a
totally
different
case.
number
one,
it's
an
open
forum
as
opposed
to
a
limited
open
forum.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
i
would
have
to
take
the
position
that
with
respect
to
that
forum
which
had
been
open
for
all
purposes--
mr.
frank
w.
miller
--uh
huh.
yes,
sir,
i
understand.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
this
court
apparently
held
it
wasn't,
although
you
looked
at
it
as
a
free
speech
case,
so
presumably--
mr.
frank
w.
miller
--in
that
particular
matter
you
allowed
it.
in
this
circumstance--
mr.
frank
w.
miller
--correct.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
not
reflected
in
the
record,
and
i'm
not
certain
of
the
answer
to
that.
i
believe,
however,
that
the
record
reflects
that
there
were
no
other
religious
uses
that
went
on
at
this
particular
school,
but
the
record
is
not
developed
on
that.
mr.
frank
w.
miller
it
is
not
fully
developed,
justice
scalia,
but
i
believe
there
is
some
evidence
of
that,
yes,
sir.
