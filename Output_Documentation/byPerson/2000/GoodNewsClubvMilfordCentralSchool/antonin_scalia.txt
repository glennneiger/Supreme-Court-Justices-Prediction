justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
marcelle,
did
you
cite
lamb's
chapel
to
the
second
circuit?
justice
antonin
scalia
lamb's
chapel,
if
i'm
correct,
is
not
even
cited
in
the
second
circuit's
opinion,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
even
mentioned?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
the
judge
who
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
second
circuit
was
aware
of
lamb's
chapel,
not
just
because
you
cited
it,
but
because
it
had
reversed
an
earlier
decision
of
his,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
at
issue
in
widmar?
what,
what
kind
of
activity?
justice
antonin
scalia
in,
in
the
school
or
to
the
whole
school
body,
before
the
whole
school
body?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
was
upheld?
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
worried
about
the
other
children
who
are,
who
are
supposedly
hanging
around
the
school
after
the
bell
rings,
instead
of
skipping
off
the
way
my
kids
do.
actually,
and
they
are
infected
by
seeing
these
other
kids
going
into
an
activity
which
they
think
represents
the
approval
of
the
state
for
these
religious
services.
i
think
that's
the
point
he's
making.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
marcelle,
was
this
the
basis
for
the
school's
refusal
to
allow
the
group,
you
can't
do
it
right
after
school?
was
that
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
was
this
point
raised
before
the
second
circuit?
was
it
part
of
the
second
circuit's
opinion?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
the
point
raised
before
the
second
circuit?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
marcelle,
when
the,
when
the
state
refuses
somebody
something
to
which
he
is
entitled
for
the
wrong
reason,
and
the
case
is
appealed
up
here,
and
we
say
that
reason
was
wrong,
do
we
normally,
if
the
state
comes
in
and
says
oh,
we
could
have,
we
could
have
done
it
for
another
reason,
you
know,
not
because
of
his
race.
we
might
have
done
it
for
some
other
reason,
do
we
normally
remand
to
give
him
a
second
bite?
aren't
they
stuck
with
the
reason
that
they
gave?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
school
said
we
will
not
let
you
conduct
this
service,
period.
justice
antonin
scalia
at
any
time
because
we
do
not
allow
religious
services
in
the
school,
and
that's
the
basis
on
which
it
was
argued
below,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean
the
establishment
clause
has
been
presented
in
this
case
at
least
as
a
defense,
that
is
to
say,
it
has
been
alleged
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
state
could
do
this
is
because
of
the
establishment
clause
problems
that
would
arise
were
they
to
do
it,
and
it
is,
it
is
quite
possibly
for
this
court's
opinion
to
address
that
establishment
clause
argument
as
well,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
trust
me,
mr.
marcelle.
justice
antonin
scalia
trust
me,
mr.
marcelle,
we
can
write
this
opinion
so
it
does
almost
nothing.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
sure
about
that?
i,
i
thought
it
would
simply
not
compel
it.
it
doesn't
cover,
it
doesn't
cover
it
except,
you
know,
student
led
activity.
justice
antonin
scalia
on
that,
you
think
this
letter
is
correct
that
hearing
a
bible
lesson
and
memorizing
scripture
is
the
equivalent
of
religious
worship?
justice
antonin
scalia
another
way
to
put
it
would
be
that
children
of
that
age
don't
engage
in
religious
worship.
they
go
to
sunday
school.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
just
because
they
go,
you
are
going
to
suddenly
convert
sunday
school
into
a
mass?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
--religious
worship
is
not
part
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
position
is
that
saying
a
prayer
is
religious
worship
and
i
assume
then
that
any
group
which
sought
to
meet
on
your
school's
property
which
opened
its
meeting
with
a
prayer
would
be
excluded,
and
you
think
that's
in
accord
with
lamb's
chapel?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
said
in
response
to
justice
souter
that
saying
a
prayer
is
religious
worship,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
so
no
group
admitted
to
this
school
program
can
say
a
prayer
to
open
its
meeting?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
just
did
say
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
were
more
religious,
but
they
were
not
necessarily
the
same
thing
as
a
church
religion...
as
a
church
worship
service,
teaching
the
scripture,
teaching
what
the
scripture
has
to
say
about
morality.
i
mean,
i
think
it's
a
great
distortion
to
call
that
a
worship
service.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
you
throw
in
a
prayer
or
two.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
divisive
in
the
community?
i
don't
understand.
what
would
the
community
get
upset
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
let
all
religious
groups
do
this,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
religious
groups
that
didn't
want
to
do
it
would
get
upset
that
other
religious
groups
did
want
to
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
must
have
a
very
divisive
community
down
there.
i'm
glad
i
don't
live
in
new
york
anymore.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
mr.
miller,
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
if
you
say
that
the
state
law
requires
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--then
certainly
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
law
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
there
is
no
difference
whatever
between
saying
that
what
the
state
law
requires
is
unconstitutional
and
saying
that
the
state
statute
is
unconstitutional.
that's
one
and
the
same.
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
if
you
say
the
state
statute
requires
this,
we
are
passing
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
statute,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
by
the
way,
the
federal
equal
access
act
does
not
prohibit
what
was
done
here.
it
does
not
contain
any
prohibitions.
it
just
says
that
the
requirements
which
this
act
imposes--
justice
antonin
scalia
--are
not
imposed
upon
elementary
schools--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
prohibit
doing
it
at
the
elementary
level.
it
just
says
federal
law
does
not
require
you
to
do
it
at
the
elementary
level.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
school,
in
fact,
never
complained
about
the
time,
none
of
this
correspondence
said
the
problem
is
you're
doing
it
right
after
school
and
these
other
kids
will
think
that...
right?
that
was
never
in
any
of
this
stuff?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
state
provides,
for
example,
crossing
guards
on
sundays
at
church
services,
and
that
is
not
thought...
to
facilitate
people
going
to
the
church
service,
there's
no
other
reason
for
it.
so
long
as
it
provides
crossing
guards
wherever
else
there
is
need
for
crossing
guards,
this
is
not
considered
to
be
an
establishment
of
religion.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
if
public
facilities...
and
i
don't...
i
know
many
schools
that
do
it.
if
they're
willing
to
let
their
facilities
be
used
for
any
public
purpose--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
must
they
exclude
a
religious
purpose
so
long
as
they're
doing
it
evenhandedly,
all
religions,
all
other
purposes,
just
like
crossing
guards?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
sundays?
on
sundays
and
after
the
kids
are
gone?
the
building's
just
lying
there.
actually
the
community
can
make
money,
it
rents
it
out
to
any
group
that
wants
it.
the
church
needs
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
you
can
violate
the
establishment
clause
for
money?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
record
show
that
there
are
a
lot
of
other
children
who
were
hanging
around
the
school
while
this
service
is
conducting...
conducted?
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
used
it
for
a
year
and
a
half.
you
actually
did
use
it
before
the
prohibition
was
issued
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
didn't
use
it?
at
what
time
did
you
use
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
at
3
o'clock.
and
was
there
any
evidence
about
whether
other
grammar
school
students
were
still
milling
about
when
you
were
using
it,
looking
longingly
at
the
classroom
where
this
was
going
on?
justice
antonin
scalia
go
ahead.
