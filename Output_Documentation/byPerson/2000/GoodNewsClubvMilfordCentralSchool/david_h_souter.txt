justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
sorry.
isn't
the
nub
of
the
problem
in
this
case
that
you're
not
dealing
with
college
students,
you're
dealing
with
grade
school
kids,
kids
from,
i
think
it
was
ages
starting
at
six
going
up
to
12.
you're
doing
it...
in
this
particular
case,
the
meeting
was
being
held
immediately
after
the
school
and
the
meeting
sounds
to
me
as
it
was
described
as
sunday
school.
they
pray.
they
sing
sort
of
children's
religious
songs,
and
they
have
a
teaching
lesson
and
i
guess
some
discussion,
but
it
sounds
like
sunday
school,
and
isn't
the
problem
in
this
case
that
you
don't
have
a
sophisticated
group
of
people
of
college
age
who
know
that
the
university
is
not
proselytizing
them
or
approving
of
their
particular
religious
practice,
whereas
in
this
case
you
have
a
bunch
of
kids
who
just
don't
make
those
kinds
of
distinctions,
and
isn't
that
the
nub
of
the
establishment
clause
problem
here,
which
didn't
exist
in
widmar?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that,
that
might
be
the
case,
and
it
might
be
the
case
that
you
would
have
a
different
case
before
us
if
those
were
your
facts,
but
whether
state
law
would
prohibit
it
or
not,
my
question
is,
don't
we
have
here
at
least
a
substantial,
i
won't
decide
it
from
the
bench,
but
don't
we
have
a
substantial
establishment
clause
issue,
which
we
simply
didn't
have
in
widmar
so
that
you
can't
take
widmar
as
being
direct
authority
for
what
was
going
on
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
get
to
number
two.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
would
never
spurn
justice
scalia's
help,
but
actually...
actually,
i
think
you
understood
my
question.
why
don't
you
answer
it
as
modified
by
justice
scalia.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's,
that's,
you
know,
that's
because
that
was
the
group
to
which
capitol
plaza
was
appealing,
but
here,
the
appeal
is
to
kids,
and
in
particular,
to
the
kids
who
are
going
to
this
sunday
school
kind
of
service.
justice
david
h.
souter
well
then,
then
do
you
feel
that
the
decision
that
the
judgment
of
the
second
circuit
should
be
vacated
and
the
case
should
be
remanded
for
consideration
of
this
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you,
what
do
you
think
should
happen?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
why,
why
should
this
issue
not
be
considered
in
the
second
circuit?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
want
to
know
how
that
explanation
that
you
just
gave
us
fits
with,
with
what
you
were
telling
justice
o'connor
a
moment
ago.
if
you
win
this
case,
and
the
school
board
says
we
want
to
revamp
our
regulations,
and
our
regulations
are
going
to
be
that
although
religious
purposes
do
not
exclude
a
group
from,
from
use
of
the
facilities,
religious
worship
does,
and
we
are
going
to
draw
the
line
there,
or
they
might
say
we
are
going
to
draw
the
line
against
any
use
that
could
be
regarded
reasonably
as
an
establishment
clause
violation
when
young
kids
are
involved.
would
you
take
the
position
then
that
because
you
think
the,
the
new
york
statute
is
unconstitutional
that
the
school
district
could
not
draw
that
restriction
or
either
of
those
restrictions
that
i
have
just
described,
and
which
if
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
does
it
render
the
school
district
in
fact,
in
this
respect,
does
it
render
the
school
district
incapable
of
drawing
any
distinction
whatever
that
has
any
reference
to
religion?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
would
like
marcelle
to
answer
that
question.
what
position,
what's
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
but...
is,
you
are
saying
that
the
state
cannot
exclude
what's
going
on...
that
the
district
could
not
exclude
what's
going
on
here.
but
is
it
because
the
statute
is
itself
unconstitutional
in
drawing
a
religious
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
no.
i
don't,
i
don't
mean
to
cut
you
off,
but
i
just
wonder,
you
answered
justice
o'connor's
question,
as
i
recall,
by
saying
yes,
the
state
could
go
back
and
revamp
the
policy
and
draw
it
more
narrowly,
and
i
understood
you
to
say,
or
to
imply
that
if
it
wanted
to
draw
a
policy
that
says
no
religious
worship
involving
young
kids
or
something
like
that,
that,
that
would
be
open
to
it
and
i
want
to
know
whether
your
position
on
the
statute
leads
you
to
say
no,
the
school
district
would
not
be,
even
without
state,
would
be
without
state
authority
under
state
law
even
to
do
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
is
that
because
the
state
statute
is
simply
inoperative
to
give
the
school
districts
the
authority
to
redraw
a
policy
more
narrowly?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
wasn't
there
a
position
below,
maybe,
maybe
i
misunderstood
what
you
were
saying,
but
i
thought
their
position
below
was
that
any
use
for
a
religious
purpose,
any,
as
you
were
putting
it,
any
expression
of
a
religious
point
of
view
on
the
subjects
that
might
be
discussed
could
be
excluded
and
that
was
the
reason
for
excluding
this.
is
that
so?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
do
you,
do
you
believe
that,
that
if
we
say
no,
that's
too
broad
a
ground,
that
they
would
then
be
foreclosed
from
redrawing
their
policy
on
a
narrower
ground
based
upon
avoidance
of
an
establishment
clause
problem
if
they
do
allow
this,
would
they
be--
justice
david
h.
souter
--would
they
be
precluded?
in
other
words,
they
are
saying
okay,
we
can't
paint
with
a
broad
brush.
we
are
going
to
paint
with
a
narrow
brush.
we
are
going
to
say
this
would
be
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause
to
allow
a
sunday
school
kind
of
worship
for
young
school
kids
immediately
after
school,
we
won't
allow
it.
would
that
in
your
judgment
be
precluded
by
the
judgment
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
your
answer.
you
are
saying
that
if
you
win
this
case
based
upon
the
ground
that
the
exclusion
broadly
of
religious
viewpoints
is
unconstitutional,
is
it
your
position
that
if
they
then
redraw
the
policy
more
narrowly
and
say
we
are
going
to
exclude
sunday
school
type
of
meetings
held
on
the
school
grounds
immediately
after
school,
is
it
your
position
that
they
would
be
foreclosed
by
the
judgment
of
this
court
in
this
case
from
doing
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well
that...
yes,
but
as
i
understand
it,
as
it
has
been
represented
to
us,
that
wasn't
the
basis
for
the
school
district's
exclusion
here.
the
basis,
as
i
understand
it,
was
what
you
just
told
justice
breyer
a
moment
ago,
that
the
district
had
chosen
to
exclude
religious
discussion
from
those
which
were,
were
open.
and
that's,
that's
a
very
different
criterion
from
saying,
we're
excluding
the
use
of
the
facilities
just
for
religious
worship.
which
was
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
was
it
religious
worship
which
was
the
ground
that
you...
you
chose
to
stand
on
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
argument
before
the
second
circuit?
justice
david
h.
souter
don't
they
pray--
justice
david
h.
souter
don't
they
pray?
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
that's
what
you
want
to
litigate,
if
on
the
broad
ground
you
lose,
you
say
we
have
raised
that,
and
we
should
be
allowed
to
litigate
that
go
back
to
district
court,
is
that
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
recognize
that,
but
you're
saying,
whether
you
agree
with
justice
scalia
or
not,
you're
saying
we
want
to
litigate
that
in
the
district
court
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
why
would
it
do
so
if,
unlike
this
case,
there's
no
particular
involvement
of
schoolchildren
involved,
and
the
district
allows
the,
let's
say
the
auditorium
to
be
used
for
a
meeting
of
the
elks,
for
a
meeting
of
the
veterans
of
foreign
wars,
and
the
baptists
have
had
their
church
burned,
and
they
want
to
use
it.
why
would...
what
would
the
theory
be
that
would
explain
why
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause
to
let
the
church
group
use
it
on
the
same
terms
as
the
vfw
and
other
secular
organizations?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no,
i'm
going
back
i
think
to
justice
breyer's
question,
and
i
understood
you
to
answer
his
question
in
such
a
way
that
would
say,
yes,
it
would,
in
my
example,
it
would
be
a
violation
to
let
the
church
group
use
it
at
the
same...
on
the
same
terms
as
the
vfw,
and
i
don't
understand
what
your
reasoning
is.
what's
the
establishment
clause
theory
that
leads
you
to
say
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
that
was
the
case,
in...
the
facts
in
widmar,
then,
would
have
been
an
establishment
clause
violation
because
in
widmar
you
had
a
state
university
property
that
was
being
used
for
purposes
of
worship,
so
that
would
have
violated
the
establishment
clause.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
talking
about
the
first
amendment,
and
now
we're
talking
about
the
establishment
clause.
i
take
it,
then,
that
given
your
answer
to
my
question
and
justice
breyer's,
you
would
say
that
the
student
worship
service
in
widmar
on
university
property
was
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause.
justice
david
h.
souter
we're
not
talking
about
forum
analysis.
we're
talking
about
establishment
clause
analysis.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
i'm
going
from
the
speech
clause
to
the
establishment
clause.
was
the
widmar
worship
service
on
public
property
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
