justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wow.
well,
then
it
would
raise
the
same
problem
as
this
raises?
so
my
question
would
be,
we
have
a
fairly...
no
prayer
in
school
is
a
controversial
policy,
but
it
has
one
virtue.
the
court's
opinion
is,
the
virtue
is
it's
clear.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
the
rule
is
as
the
courts
interpreted
it,
that
school
activities
cannot
involve
prayer.
well,
isn't
the
corollary
of
that
where
there
isn't
school
activities,
it
can
involve
prayer,
and
it
can
involve
religious
activities,
and
here
we
are
after
school,
so
the
same
clear
rule
would
say
you
can't
pray
in
school,
but
after
school
is
different,
and
you
can't
discriminate
against
religion
after
school.
now,
i
put
that
because
that's,
i'm
putting
it
squarely.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
hear
your
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and,
and
my,
my
thought
is
aimed
at
the
clarity
of
such
a
rule
that
ordinary
people
can
understand,
in
light
of
the
basic
principles
underlying
establishment
on
the
one
hand
and
free
speech
on
the
other.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly.
and
the
question
is,
after
school--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--people
can
talk
about
any
subject
matter,
but
not
religion.
that
sounds
to
me
as
if
you
are
discriminating
in
free
speech
terms
against
religion.
and
now
my
question
is,
why
isn't
that
contrary
to
the
constitution?
it's
after
school.
it's
not
a
school
activity.
and
it
doesn't
help
me
to
talk
about
open
forums
or
not
open
forums
or
whatever.
i
want,
i
want
to
know
what,
what
the
principle
is,
what
the
theory
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
suppose
it
was.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i'm
just
putting
this
to
get
your
response.
it
doesn't
necessarily
reflect
what
i'm
thinking.
but
social
events,
it
doesn't
say
social
discussion.
civic
events,
recreational
events.
entertainment
events.
i
guess
that
includes
chess
club,
dances.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
includes
all
kinds
of
activity.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
suppose
you
were
to
say
any
activity
is
fine,
just
one
is
not.
religious
activity
is
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
after
school.
now,
my
question
is
given
lamb's
chapel,
why
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
what
seems
to
be
what
you're
saying.
what
you
excluded
here,
there
is
a
separate
section
and
it
says
the
separate
section,
use
for
nonreligious
purposes.
it
says
school
premises
shall
not
be
used
by
any
individual
or
organization
for
religious
purposes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you
have
on
one
side
of
the
page
is
use
it
for
anything,
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
page,
there
is
an
exception,
religious
purposes.
now,
my
question,
which
has
been
throughout
is,
how
do
you
square
that
with
lamb's
chapel,
i.e.,
since
its
after
school,
and
isn't
a
school
activity,
why
isn't
it
discrimination
against
religion
under
the
first
amendment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
doesn't
that
make
it
worse?
every
other
subject
matter
is
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
that's
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
the
right
way,
then,
to
deal
with
what
i
would
see
as
the
difficult
issue
in
this
case,
the
difficult
issue
being
suppose
it's
a
total
prayer
service?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
imagine
that
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
is
the
way
to
get
at
that
problem,
if
assuming
there
is
a
problem,
that
either
a
total
prayer
service
would
be
unlawful,
either
you
have...
either
it
would
violate
the
establishment
clause
or
it
wouldn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it
doesn't
violate
the
establishment
clause,
you
lose
this
case
a
fortiori.
if
it
does
violate
the
establishment
clause,
then
the
way
to
get
at
it
is
through
litigating
the
establishment
clause
issue.
i'm
trying
to
figure
out.
that's
been
the
point
of
my
question.
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
do
this
on
the
assumption
that
this
is
pure
prayer,
which
i
know
it
isn't,
because
the
other
alternative
you
could
argue
whether
it
is
or
isn't,
but
assume
it
was,
how
do
we
get
at
that
issue?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
why
would
it
violate
the
establishment
clause?
i
mean,
let's
take
an
extreme
case,
a
local
church,
which
doesn't
have
a
building,
says,
we
would
like
to
use
the
school
for
worship
services
two
or
three
times
a
week
at
4:00
in
the
afternoon
to
6:00,
all
right?
so
they
do
it.
and
the
school
district
says,
no,
this
is
a
school,
it's
not
a
church.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even
after
school.
now
why,
i
want
to
understand
why...
it
may
well.
why
does
it
violate
the
establishment
clause,
in
your
view?
after
all,
you
could
turn
it
into
a
gymnasium.
that's
not
the...
this
is
not
a
discrimination
point.
this
is
an
establishment
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
as
long
as...
i
would
like
you
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
he
was
finished.
do
you
have
something
else?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
he
was.
if
you
have
an
extra
minute,
i'd
like
just
to
get
your
view
on
what
i'm
finding
is
the
most
difficult
part
of
this,
which
we
may
not
reach.
to
take
the
opponent's
point
on
the
establishment
clause,
suppose
the
city
hall
says
every
sunday
we
can
use
the
city
hall
as
a
church,
we'll
let
church
groups
use
it.
so
every
sunday
the
city
hall
becomes
a
church.
does
that
violate
the
establishment
clause?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
what
they'll
say
is
any
group
can
use
it.
now,
what
happens
is
that
every
sunday
the
city
hall
becomes
a
church
and
all
the
community
goes
there
and
gathers
and
prays.
does
that
violate
the
establishment
clause?
