justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
what
is
the,
is
there
a
state
statutory
ceiling
you
say?
in
other
words,
is
there
a
state
limit
on
how
much
religious
activity
they
could
permit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
challenging
both
the
school
board's
regulation
and
the
state
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i'm
asking,
are
you
challenging--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
you
are
contending
the
statute
is
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
on
the
equal
access,
i
don't
really
have
it
in
mind.
does
the
equal
access
act
not
require
or
does
it
prohibit
the
activity
you
are
describing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
prohibits
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
are
you
contending
that
the
state
statute
required
this
policy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
factual
question?
does
the
record
tell
us
how
big
the
group
was
of
the
children
involved
in
this
club?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
