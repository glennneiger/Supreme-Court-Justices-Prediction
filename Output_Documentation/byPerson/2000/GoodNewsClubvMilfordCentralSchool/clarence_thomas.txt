justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
respondent
milford
central
school
authorizes
district
residents
to
use
its
building
after
school
for
instruction
and
education,
learning
or
the
arts,
and
social,
civic,
recreational,
and
the
entertainment
uses
pertaining
to
the
community
welfare.
petitioners
good
news
club,
a
private
christian
organization
for
children,
sought
approval
to
use
the
school’s
facilities.
milford
denied
the
club’s
request
to
hold
its
weekly
meetings
after
school
in
the
school’s
building
on
the
ground
that
the
club’s
proposed
use
was
equivalent
of
religious
worship.
petitioners
filed
suit
under
section
1983,
alleging
that
the
denial
of
the
club’s
application
violated
its
free
speech
rights.
the
district
court
granted
milford
summary
judgment.
the
second
circuit
affirmed,
and
held
that
because
the
club’s
subject
matter
was
quintessentially
religious
and
its
activities
fell
outside
the
bounds
of
pure
moral
and
character
development,
milford's
policy
was
constitutional.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse.
because
the
parties
so
agree,
we
assume
that
milford
operates
a
limited
public
forum.
accordingly,
in
operating
its
forum,
milford
must
not
discriminate
against
speech
base
on
viewpoint.
we
hold
that
milford
by
denying
the
club
access
on
the
ground
that
the
club
is
religious
in
nature,
discriminated
against
the
club
because
of
its
religious
viewpoint
in
violation
of
free
speech
clause.
milford’s
exclusion
of
the
club
is
indistinguishable
from
the
unconstitutional
exclusions
in
lamb’s
chapel,
and
rosenberger
versus
rector
and
visitors
of
the
university
of
virginia.
we
also
conclude
that
permitting
the
club
to
meet
on
the
school’s
premises
would
not
have
violated
the
establishment
clause.
first,
we
rejected
establishment
clause
defense
as
similar
to
milford’s
in
lamb’s
chapel,
and
also
in
widmar
versus
vincent.
second,
we
reject
milford’s
attempt
to
distinguish
those
cases
by
emphasizing
that
its
policy
involves
elementary
school
children.
we
have
never
foreclosed
private
religious
conducts
during
non-school
hours
merely
because
it
takes
place
on
school
premises
where
elementary
school
children
maybe
present.
