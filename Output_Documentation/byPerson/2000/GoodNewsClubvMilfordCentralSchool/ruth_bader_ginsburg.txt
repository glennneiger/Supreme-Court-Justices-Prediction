might
there
not
be
a
problem
with
the
establishment
clause,
apart
from
the
viewpoint
versus
content
discrimination
if
there
were
say
a
church
service
to
be
conducted
the
same
time
the
boy
scouts
are
meeting?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
are
talking
about
a
first
amendment
free
speech
right.
that's
how
you
open
this.
there
is
also
an
issue
that
hasn't
been
aired
in
this
case,
and
that
is
the
issue
that
arose
in
widmar
and
in
murgens,
the
distinction
between,
for
establishment
clause
purposes,
people
of
a
certain
sophistication
versus
younger
people.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
age
of
the,
the...
that
played
some
role
in
the
court's
decision,
didn't
it?
that
these
were
college
students
who
had
a
degree
of
sophistication
and
could
distinguish
between
just
opening
it
up
to
everybody,
and
the
school
endorsing
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
were
the
plaintiff
in
the
case,
and
you
had
the
first
amendment
theory,
and
that
lost,
and
you
appealed
on
that
theory.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
it
would
seem
to
me
if
the
other
issue
was,
was
not
aired,
we
should
not
decide
it
in
the
first
instance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
there
were
to
be
an
action,
let's
say
you
prevailed
in
this
action,
there
would
be
an
action
by
parents
of
a
6
year
old
attending
this
school,
that
would
challenge
the
allowance
of
this
group
on
establishment
clause
grounds,
that
would
in
no
way
be
foreclosed
by
this,
this
decision
if
the
issue
is
there,
but
not
decided
by
this
case,
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
whole
question
one
way
or
another
of
whether
elementary
school
students
are
differently
situated
than
high
school
students
or
college
students
would
be
open
in
any
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
confused.
i
thought
you
said
it
wasn't
raised.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
to
you
clarify
now
something
that
mr.
marcelle
addressed
as
well.
you
have
said
that
you
raised
the
establishment
clause
as
an
affirmative
defense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
the
district
court
said
i'm
not
going
to
deal
with
it
because
i
decide
the
case
in
your
favor
on
another
ground.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
was
raised,
you
raised
it,
but
it
wasn't
decided.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
got
to
remain
open.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
this
particular
district,
this
school
district,
we're
dealing
with
elementary
grades?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
practice
with
respect
to
high
school
or
public
colleges
in
that
area?
do
they
have
student
groups
that
can
meet
for
religious
purposes
as
well
as
all
others?
