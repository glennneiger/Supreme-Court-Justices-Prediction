mr.
thomas
marcelle
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
is
a
free
speech
case.
on
page
13
of
its
brief
in
opposition
to
certiorari,
milford
concedes
that
state
law,
the
same
state
law
at
issue
in
lamb's
chapel,
requires
it
to
censor
petitioner's
speech
from
its
broad
community
forums
at
all
times,
to
all
audiences
because
they
had
a
religious
purpose.
this
court
rejected
such
an
argument
in
lamb's
chapel.
it
should
reject
it
in
this
case
as
well.
the
second
circuit
circumvented
this
court's
decision
in
lamb's
chapel
by
resurrecting
a
distinction
that
this
court
buried
in
widmar.
a
distinction
between
constitutionally
protected
speech
and
unconstitutionally
protected
religious
worship
and
instruction.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
yes,
your
honor,
quite
extensively,
and
dissent
as
well
said,
judge
jacobs
said
the
case
couldn't
be
squared
with
lamb's
chapel.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
isn't
even
mentioned.
and
i
think
the
way
they
got
around
lamb's
chapel,
your
honor,
was
really
by
embracing
a
distinction
that
this
court
rejected
in
rosenberger,
a
distinction--
mr.
thomas
marcelle
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
he
was
the
author
of
lamb's
chapel
that
this
court
reversed.
and
i
think
the
way--
mr.
thomas
marcelle
--absolutely.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
your
honor,
yes,
they--
mr.
thomas
marcelle
--yes,
your
honor.
they
have
broad
discretion,
the
school
board--
mr.
thomas
marcelle
--exactly,
justice
o'connor.
we're
not
asking
for
unique
access,
just
equal
access.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
because,
your
honor,
milford
has
chosen
to
create
a
forum
that
it's
probably
the
broadest
possible
forum
you
could
create,
the
uses
that
pertain
to
the
welfare
of
the
community
under
this
policy,
i
think
they
would
a
mass,
or
a
church
service
would
qualify,
but
of
course,
they
have
the
power
and
the
discretion.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
yes,
your
honor,
under
this
policy.
of
course
the
school
could
write
the
policy
to
limit
it
to
athletic,
just
athletic
events
or
just
theatrical
events
but
they
couldn't
exclude
religious
groups
or
religious
viewpoints
on
those
subjects.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
correct.
i
think
again
in
this
case
milford
has
drafted
the
broadest
possible
policy.
it's
really
when
you
say
any
social,
civic
or
recreation
use
or
other
uses
pertaining
to
the
community
you,
i
think,
have
created
the
broadest
possible
forum--
mr.
thomas
marcelle
--that's
correct.
and
i
think
the
phrase
is
other
uses
that
pertain
to
the
welfare
of
the
community,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
ginsburg,
for
this
reason.
when
you
choose,
when
you
choose,
as
milford
has
in
this
case,
to
shut
its
school
down
at
3
o'clock
and
thereby
open
up
a
public
forum
inside
your
school,
you
can't
restrict
religious
viewpoints
even
if
the
viewpoint
in
the
speech
is
exercise
in
a
religious
ceremony.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
justice
ginsburg,
i'll
give
you
two
answers
to
your
inquiry.
one,
i
think
this
is
like
widmar.
for
example,
in
widmar
would
essentially
be
the
cornerstone
group
which
was
the
student
group
that
sought
access
to
the
school
was
a
religious
group
singing
religious
songs,
reading
the
bible
and
praying,
and
this
court
didn't
find
a
constitutional
problem
in
that
case
because
it
was--
mr.
thomas
marcelle
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
and
in
this
case,
in
widmar,
the
appropriate
community
was
the
students
so
you
would
look
at
the
observer
student,
but
in
this
case,
milford
has
ended
school
and
has
opened
up
a
community
forum
for
parents
to
initiate
and
parents
to
run
these
community
groups.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
it
was
a...
praying
and
reading
the
bible
and
singing
religious
songs
and
teaching
from
the
bible.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
not
before
the
whole
school
body,
your
honor.
just
to
the
participants
who
wanted
to
hear
and
chose
to
hear
this
message
like
this
case.
the
only
children
who
attend
the
good
news
club
are
sent
there
by
their
parents.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
and
that
was
upheld,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
if
i
may,
justice,
be
allowed
to
give
you,
kind
of,
two
answers.
one,
that's
not
the
case
because
if
this
meeting
was
conducted
at
9
o'clock
at
night
and
was
given
just
to
adults,
state
law
would
prohibit
from
them
meeting
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
i
would
say
the
answer...
and
that
would
be
in
the
second
part
of
my
answer.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
--to
your,
to
your
question,
is
the
parents
are
the
ones
who
decide
whether
or
not
the
children
will
attend.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
i
guess
i
would
go
back
to
justice
o'connor's
concurrence
in
capitol
square
where
she
said
the
endorsement
tests
and
the
establishment
clause
are
concerned
with
the
political
community
at
large
and
not
particular
individuals
or
isolated
observers.
here
the
day
ends
and--
mr.
thomas
marcelle
--i
guess
i
would
disagree
with
all
respect,
justice
souter.
i
think
the
appeal
is
to
the
parents.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
no.
that
was
not
the
basis.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
absolutely
not.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
if
i
could
search
my
memory
and
i
don't
believe,
or
if
it
was
raised,
it
was
raised
tangentially,
your
honor.
it
certainly
wasn't
the
thrust.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
well,
i,
i
think
what
happens
is
for
the
purpose
of--
mr.
thomas
marcelle
--excuse
me.
i
think
this
case
should
be
reversed
and
remanded
back
to
district
court
to
grant
the
relief
we
requested.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
i
believe
that
milford
school
had
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
yes.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
justice
ginsburg,
there
was
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment.
we
moved
for
summary
judgment
and
the
school
district
moved
for
summary
judgment,
and
to
defeat
our
motion
for
summary
judgment,
they
had
the
burden
of
proving
a
compelling
state
interest
and
that
the
censorship
forum,
from
the
forum
was
the
least
restrictive
means
to
achieve
that
interest.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
well,
i
think,
they
are
stuck
with
the
record
as
in
any
trial,
on
any
appeal,
you
could
raise
new
issues
and
new
grounds
and
could
have
a
new
trial.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
at
any
time.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
no,
it
did
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
were
briefly,
my
recollection,
questioned
about
it,
but
the
second
circuit
did
not
rest
its
decision
on
that
grounds.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
thomas
marcelle
--that's
correct.
and
it's--
mr.
thomas
marcelle
--that's
correct,
justice
kennedy
and
in
fact
on
the
joint
appendix
at
g
4
and
i
believe
it's
paragraph
13,
it's
the
superintendent's
affidavit
where
he
is
basically
says
that
your
speech
is
too
religious
to
be
using
the
forum.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
no,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
yes.
new
york
state
education
law
grants
the
power
to
the
local
school
boards.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
but
does
not
require
it.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
yes.
what
state
law
sets
a
ceiling
for
what
school
districts
can
do,
and
they
can
go,
the
floor
goes
to
not
even
opening
the
forum
and
they
can
go
anywhere
in
between.
here,
milford
chose
to,
the
maximum
possible
extent
allowed
under,
under--
mr.
thomas
marcelle
--absolutely,
justice
o'connor.
new
york
grants
them
broad
discretion
and
the
school
board
has
that
ability
to
exercise
that
discretion.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
yes,
justice
stevens.
it's
state--
mr.
thomas
marcelle
--they
gave
both
reasons
for
denial,
and--
mr.
thomas
marcelle
--i'm
sorry,
yes,
justice
stevens.
we
are
challenging
both.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
the
statute
to
the
extent...
justice
stevens,
actually
it
requires
a
little
explanation
under
new
york
law.
it
really
isn't
that,
the
history
in
new
york
law
is
a
little
more
entangled.
the
state
legislature
had
opened
up
it
for
these
broad
purposes
if
the
school
board
so
chose.
in
1978,
there
was
a
mid
level
appellate
court
in
the
state
that
was
decided
prior
to
murgens
that
said
because
the
state
legislature
didn't
specifically
include
religious
purposes
in
the
statute,
the
court
interpreted
as
it
meant
to
exclude
religious
purposes,
although
the
state
doesn't,
the
statute
doesn't
say
that,
that
has
become
part
of
the
judicial
interpretation
of
the
statute,
so
i
don't
want
to
mislead
you
and
it's
contained
in
the
statute,
justice
stevens.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
i
believe
widmar
answers
that
question,
justice
souter.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
my
argument
is
religious
worship
is
inherently
a
religious
viewpoint.
in
other
words,
when
i
say
hail
mary
full
of
grace
and
say
amen,
that's
my
internal
attitude.
if
i
say
ha
ha,
i'm
allowed
in
the
forum,
but
if
i
say
amen,
i'm
excluded
and
it
seems
to
me
what
makes
one
worship
and
the
other
not
worship
is
my
internal
attitude.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
no.
i
believe
it's
unconstitutional
under
the
free
speech
clause.
that
is,
the
state
cannot
exclude
religious
viewpoints
from
a
forum
that
otherwise
speaks
on
the
subject
matter.
for
example,
in
this
case--
mr.
thomas
marcelle
--my
position
is
that
the
first
amendment
prohibits
drawing
that
distinction,
if
that,
whatever
you
called
the
worship
fits
within
the
otherwise
religious
neutral
boundaries
of
the
forum.
so,
for
example--
mr.
thomas
marcelle
--no.
i
think
the
limitation
on
the
school
board
is
the
first
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
i
guess
that
would
be
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
i
mean,
i
guess
cases
can't
stand
for
propositions
which
aren't
decided
in
them,
and
i
think
that's--
mr.
thomas
marcelle
--depending
how
the
court
wrote
the
opinion,
yes.
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
i
would
assume
it's
quite
possible,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
i'm
sorry,
i
said
that,
excuse
me,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
what
i
was
trying
to
say
in
response
to
justice
souter's
question
was
they
hadn't
met
their
burden.
it's
different
between,
i
think,
not
raising
it
and
not
meeting
the
burden
of
proof
of
showing
a
compelling
stage.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
that's
correct,
justice
souter.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
i
guess
that's--
mr.
thomas
marcelle
--absolutely.
and
moreover,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
there
is
also
this
problem.
this
is
a
broad
community
forum,
and
parents,
it
would
seem
to
me
the
establishment
clause
was
crafted
to
defend
the
rights
of
the
religious
people
to
participate
in
broad
community
forums
and
to
exclude
andrea
fournier
from
a
forum
because
of
her
religion
would
seem
to
be
the
very
value
that
the
establishment
clause
was,
was
crafted
to
defend,
so
if
she
wears
her
daisy
scout
uniform,
for
example,
she
is
okay
to
come
in,
but
if
she
wears
her
good
news
club
uniform,
she
is
not.
and
it,
i
think
not
only
the
free
speech
clause
protects
her
right
to
meet
under
those
circumstances,
but
not
to
be
excluded
from
a
broad
community
forum
and
the
parents
not
to
be
excluded
from
the
broad
community
forum
also
is
protected
by
the
establishment.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
the
way
you
state
it,
justice
souter,
absolutely.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
thomas
marcelle
if
the
court...
if
it
would
please
the
court,
i
have
two
quick
points
to
make
on
rebuttal.
first,
i
believe
there
is
a
slight
misstatement
of
the
record.
at
the
cert
petition,
appendix
h,
page
6,
it
describes
milford
school
as
a
housing...
building
of
both
elementary,
junior
high,
and
high
school.
the
school
building
contains
grades
k-12,
not
just
elementary
school.
second,
with
respect
to
the
equal
access
act,
i
believe
justice
scalia
is
right,
it
is
only
a
mandate
that
congress
passed
it.
if
a
high
school
did
certain
things,
they
would
have
to
allow
certain
other
high
school
groups.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
makes
it
a
prohibition
to
it,
even
in
the
absence
of
the
law,
to
allow
other
groups.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
no,
i'm
finished,
justice.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
not
if
it
has
a
broad
forum.
it
would
violate
the
statute--
mr.
thomas
marcelle
--i
don't
believe
so,
justice
breyer.
i
believe
as
long
as
the
forum
is
open,
the...
and
the
state
is
neutral,
that
a
reasonable
observer
would
be
aware
of
the
policy
and
the
history
and
the
context
of
the
situation
and
wouldn't
view
that
the
state
was
endorsing
the
religious
ceremony,
but,
rather,
the
adherents
who
chose
to
avail
themselves
of
the
forum,
the
endorsement
belongs
really
to
the
people
who
attend
and
not
be
accredited
to
the
state
as
long
as
the
state
didn't
really
encourage
or
promote
or
recognize
the--
mr.
thomas
marcelle
--how
many,
justice
stevens?
mr.
thomas
marcelle
initially,
at
the
time
of
making
the
application,
there
were
20,
and
we
had
opportunity
to
use
the
school
for
a
year
and
a
half,
and
at
the
conclusion
of
that,
at
the
time
we
made
our
motion
for
summary
judgment,
i
believe,
it
was
the
same
number.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
the
district
court...
yes,
justice
scalia,
the
district
court
issued
an
injunction,
and
we
used
the
school
facilities
for
a
year
and
a
half.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
at
3
o'clock,
the
high
school
resource
room.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
no,
justice
scalia.
in
fact--
mr.
thomas
marcelle
--in
fact,
in
the
district
court's
opinion,
and
for
the
preliminary
injunction,
it
says
such
a
case
would
be
unlikely.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
yes,
a
high
school
resource
room,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
thomas
marcelle
that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
