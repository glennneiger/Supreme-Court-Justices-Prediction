justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
roberts,
the
indeterminacy
of
all
this
i
think
is
what
is
bothering
a
lot
of
us,
and
let
me
put
the
question
slightly
different
from
the
way
others
have
done.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
considering
a
public
policy
exception
here
we
are
in
a
different...
we
at
this
particular
court
in
this
context
are
in
a
different
position
from
courts
simply
sitting
in
the
traditional
common
law
circumstances
in
which
you
have
two
independent
contracting
parties,
and
we're
in
a
different
position
because
in
fact
we've
got
a
labor
contract
here,
and
we
have
a
body
of
law
which
i
assume
we
can
rely
on
which
places
tremendous
value
on
the
process
of
arbitration
under
cva
and
respect
for
the
arbitrator's
agreement...
determination.
so
that
if
we
are
going
to
provide
a
public
policy,
or
recognize
a
public
policy
exception
here,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
got
to
be
one
in
which
the
force
of
the
public
policy
thought
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
arbitrator's
award
has
got
to
be
very,
very,
very
clear
and
strong
and
so
on.
it's
not
the
kind
of,
or
the
degree
of
public
policy
that
might
satisfy
a
traditional
common
law
context.
given
the
high
degree
of
persuasiveness
that
the
policy
has
got
to
have
to
overcome
these
presumptions,
is
there
any
way,
practical
way
to
administer
it
short
of
what
the
court
did,
and
that
in
effect
is
to
say,
look,
you've
got
to
have
inconsistency
with
positive
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
is
if
you
set
the
strength
of
the
policy
too
low.
i
mean,
that
depends
on
how
strong
the
policy
has
got
to
be.
if--
justice
david
h.
souter
--go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
except
that
up
to
a
point
it
is,
because
as
i
understand
the
dot
regs
in
effect...
i
think
the
phrase
that
has
been
used,
leave
the
issue
of
when
you
can
fire,
or
whether
you
can
fire
for
a
repeat
offense,
to
private
ordering,
so
it
is
in
fact
an
issue
of
the
meaning
of
the
contract,
and
the
arbitrator
is
right
smack
in
the
middle
of
what
the
arbitrator
is
best
at
doing
when
the
arbitrator
makes
a
decision
like
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
they
don't,
but
the...
when
the
agreement...
when
the
private
ordering
addresses
this
subject,
and
the
arbitrator
is
applying
that
agreement,
the
arbitrator
is
acting
in
sort
of
a
quintessential
arbitrator's
role,
so
that
it's
quite
true
the
arbitrator
doesn't...
isn't
a
separate
source,
perhaps,
of
public
policy,
but
the
arbitrator's
decision
is
entitled
to
the
greatest
deference
that
it's
ever
entitled
to.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
how
does
the...
how
does
a
court
know
that
that
individual,
when
he
gets
behind
the
wheel
on
monday
morning,
is
any
more
of
a
risk
to
the
people
on
the
road
than
the
guy
who
had
three
martinis
on
saturday
night
and
is
sober
on
monday
morning
and
gets
in
the
truck?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
do
we...
how
does
a
court
know
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
--why
doesn't
the
regulation
address
it,
mr.
roberts?
i
mean,
i
think
that's
the
problem
i
had
with
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
and
the
distinction
that
you
were
drawing
in
mine
between
the
way
congress
treated
alcohol
and
treated
drugs.
if,
in
fact,
it
is
so
clear
that
the
deterrent
effect
would
be
vitiated
unless
there
were
a
firing
and
so
on,
why
didn't
dot
provide
it,
and
the
fact
that
dot
didn't
provide
it
seems
to
erect
a
caution
sign
in
my
mind
in
the
face
of
a
court
that
purports
to
be
able
to
infer
the
clear
public
policy
that
you
rest
upon.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
not
getting
into
so
much
a
technical
kind
of
preemption
as
i
am
a
practical
kind
of
psychology.
if
it
was
as
clear
as
your
argument
seems
to
assume
it
is,
why
wasn't
it
clear
enough
for
congress
to
come
out
and
say
so
in
so
many
words?
