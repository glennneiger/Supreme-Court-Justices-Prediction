chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
twice
the
driver
in
this
case
tested
positive
for
illegal
drugs,
and
twice
the
company
that
employed
him
to
drive
its
25-ton
vehicles
in
west
virginia
tried
to
fire
him.
each
time
an
arbitrator
ordered
the
driver
reinstated.
the
second
time
the
company
went
to
court,
arguing
that
the
reinstatement
award
should
not
be
enforced
because
it
was
contrary
to
public
policy
to
put
this
driver
back
behind
the
wheel.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
rejected
that
argument
and
concluded
that
because
reinstatement
was
not
illegal,
the
public
policy
exception
to
the
enforceability
of
contracts,
quote,
does
not
apply,
unquote.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
the
agreement
said
that
in
the
case
of
a
positive
drug
test
the
driver
was
subject
to
sanctions
up
to
and
including
termination,
and
the
arbitrator
concluded
that
in
this
case
they
hadn't
established
just
cause.
that,
of
course,
is
the
predicate
for
the
application
of
the
public
policy
exception
in
every
case,
the
fact
that
the
contract
provides
a
result
that
is
different
from
the
one
the
parties
are
arguing
for
under
public
policy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
there
was
a
proposal,
and
it
was
just
not
adopted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
don't
know
if
it
was
because
it
was
regarded
as
too
strict
or
not
strict
enough.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
certainly
after
one
positive
test.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
question
of
a--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no.
the
question
of
a
recidivist
is
not
addressed
by
the
regulations
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
the
regulations
provide...
and
we
agree
with
the
solicitor
general's
reading
of
the
regulations.
we
don't
take
issue
with
it...
is
that
in
a
case
of
a
positive
drug
test
a
couple
of
things
have
to
happen.
the
driver,
before
he
can
go
back
to
work,
has
to
pass
the
minimum
requirements,
which
is
just
evaluation
by
a
substance
abuse
professional
and
pass
a
return
to
work
test,
and
then
whether
or
not
the
driver
gets
his
job
back
is
left
to
private
ordering.
now,
if
that
private
ordering
takes
the
form
of
a
contract,
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
that
contract
should
be
subject
to
the
public
policy
exception
just
like
every
other
contract
is.
there
is
not--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
we
could
have
tried.
whether
or
not
it
would
have
been
the
result
of
the
collective
bargaining
practice
is
another
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
arbitrator
determined
that
we
didn't,
i
think
is
the
best
way
to
put
it.
now...
but
under
this
court's
decision
in
kaiser
steel,
though,
even
if
we
had
signed
a
contract
that
was
illegal,
we'd
still
have
standing
to
object
to
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
there's
no
question
about
that.
again,
all
that
does
is
pose
the
question
under
the
public
policy
exception.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
the
union
agreed
to
it,
if
it
were
phrased
in
such
a
way
that
it
were
not
subject
to
an
arbitrator's
misinterpretation,
and
it's
also
the
case
that
it
may
not
be
the
best
result.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
there
are
some
contracts.
in
other
cases
unions
have
resisted
them,
and
in
other
cases
perhaps
the
employer
recognizes
that
an
absolute
rule
may
not
be
the
best
result.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
right,
and
for
a
very
important
reason,
is
because
the
doctrine
that
we're
talking
about
is
a
doctrine
of
contract
law.
it
only
applies
when
the
question
of
the
enforcement
of
a
contract
is
at
issue.
that
is
an
important
limitation
on
the
public
policy
role
for
the
courts,
and--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--oh,
but
there
is
something
very
much
that
constrains
the
company's
choice
in
that
situation,
and
that's
tort
law.
the
same
public
policy
that
informs
the
exercise
of
the
public
policy
exception
when
the
court
is
asked
to
enforce
the
contract
restrains
what
the
company
can
do
on
its
own
unilaterally.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
the...
the
question
would
come
up
when
someone
wanted
to
enforce
a
contract.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
it
would
not
prevent
the
application
of
the
public
policy
exception.
the...
in
every
case
that
the
question
comes
up,
whether
it's
this
case
or
the
kensington--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
would
not
prevent
the
court--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
what
it
would
prohibit,
depending
on
the
circumstances,
and
the
town
of
newton
case
said
this
is
a
very
fact
intensive
inquiry
on
the
court's
part,
when
the
court
is
asked
to
enforce
the
two
strikes,
and
he
should
be
fired,
the
fact
that
the
contract
provided
three
strikes
doesn't
act
as
an
absolute
bar.
it
is
always
the
case
when
the
public
policy
question
comes
up
that
the
contract
provides
something
else.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
the
public
policy
exception
is
the
one
this
court
articulated
in
town
of
newton,
which
is
that
courts
have
not
only
the
authority
but
the
obligation
to
decline
to
enforce
contracts
that
are
illegal
or
that
violate
public
policy.
now,
to
determine
whether
they
violate
public
policy,
what
this
court
did
was
adopt
the
restatement
test,
one
that
has
been
developed
over
centuries
of
common
law,
which
asks
whether
the
interests
in
enforcing
the
agreement
are
outweighed
in
the
circumstances
by
a
public
policy
harm
by
the
enforcement
of
the
agreement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--certainly.
the
public
policy
in
this
case
is
the
public
policy
against
the
use
of
illegal
drugs
by
those
in
safety
sensitive
positions.
now,
that
policy
is
well
defined,
because
congress
and
the
executive
have
said
what
those
positions
are,
not
the
courts.
congress
and
the
executive
have
said
it
covers
these
substances,
not
the
courts,
and
the
policy
is
so
strong
that
congress
has
said,
we're
going
to
test
you
to
make
sure
that
the
policy
is
implemented,
and
congress
and
the
executive
have
said
how
that
testing
should
be
done,
and
how
often.
the
courts--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
at
that
point
you
get
into
the
fact
intensive
weighing
that
this
court
in
town
of
newton
says,
said
has
to
be
done.
in
other
words,
you
have
to
look
at
all
of
the
circumstances
and
determine
whether
that
policy--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--with
respect
to
the
one
strike
i
think
the
regulations
would
prevent
that
in
most
situations,
because
they
contemplate
that
in
some
circumstances
you
can
be
reinstated,
so
there
should
not
be
an
absolute
rule
of
one
strike
and
you're
out.
now,
the
objection
your
honor
raises
is
the
same
objection
that
could
have
been
raised
in
the
town
of
newton
case.
how
do
you
tell
which
release
dismissal
agreement
violates
the
policies
underlying
section
1983?
it's
an
objection
that
has
been
raised
with
respect
to
the
public
policy
exception
since
the
beginning.
go
back
to
the
muschany
case
and
even
before
that.
and
yet
the
exception
has
endured
because
the
courts
have
recognized
that
if
courts
do
not
ensure
that
contracts
do
not
violate
public
policy,
no
one
else
can.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
absolutely,
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
one...
yes...
well,
in
the
testing,
but
what
the
court
said
in
muschany,
repeated
in
grace
and
in
misco,
is,
courts
just
don't
pluck
these
policies
out
of
the
air.
you
have
to
look
to
the
laws
and
legal
precedents.
you
look
to
the
testing
act,
the
dot
regulations,
the
drug
free
work
place
acts,
and
one
thing
they
establish
is
a
strong
policy
of
deterrence.
they
didn't
think
that
by
imposing
this
testing
regime
they
would
catch
everybody
who's
using
drugs.
what
they
thought
was,
if
people
knew
they
were
going
to
be
tested
and
consequences
were
going
to
flow
from
that,
people
would
stop
using
drugs.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
i
think--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
it
is.
now,
there
may
be--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i...
first
of
all,
i
think
that's
the
policy
as
a
general
matter.
i
don't
think...
again,
this
is
not
an
area
where
the
court
adopts
general
categorical
rules.
for
example,
if
the
two
tests
are
15
years
apart,
or
something
like
that,
perhaps
in
that
situation
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
say
you
cannot
be
reinstated.
that
of
course
is
not
the
situation
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
first
of
all,
the
application
of
the
exception
is
in
no
way
inconsistent
with
the
deference
to
arbitrators.
in
the
grace
case,
which
involved--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
have--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
have
a
common
law
rule
that
authorizes
and
obligates
courts
to
apply
this,
and
the
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
and
it
is
the
union's
argument,
is
that
you
should
have
an
exception
to
that
rule
in
the
labor
area
because
we
defer
to
arbitrators,
but
we
defer
to
arbitrators
because
they
have
expertise
in
the
interpretation
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that
is
not
the
question
when
it
comes
to
public
policy.
as
this
court--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
no.
that
depends
on
what
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
provides,
and
collective
bargaining
agreements
do
not
shape
public
policy.
they
shape
a
private
agreement
between
an
employer
and
a
union,
and
as
this--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--as
this
court
said
in
the
wright
decision,
the
deference
that
is
accorded
arbitrators
is
limited
by
the
rationale
that
supports
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
think
they're
both
entitled
to
the
same
weight,
and
all
that
the
arbitrator's
decision
does
is
tell
you
what
the
parties
agreed
to.
they
say,
this
interpretation
is
binding
on
the
parties.
well,
that
just
poses
the
question
that
is
presented.
when
you
have
an
application
of
the
public
policy
doctrine
you
assume
that
the
parties
have
agreed
to
something
else.
in
the
kensington
case,
mrs.
bleaker
signed
an
agreement
limiting
her...
the
liability
of
the
company
to
250
francs.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
the
criminal
sanctions
that
your
honor
addressed
don't
take
into
account
what
the
contract
enforcement
is
going
to
bring
about,
and
that
is,
putting
this
individual,
who
in
the
course
of
15
months
failed
two
tests
for
illegal
drugs,
behind
the
wheel
of
a
25-ton
vehicle
on
the
roads
in
west
virginia.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
again--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
court
knows
that
because
congress
told
it
that.
congress
drew
a
distinction
in
the
testing
act.
it
said,
when
we
test
for
alcohol
we
test
when
you're
there
performing
the
functions,
because
you
have
to
be
sober.
it's
all
right
if
you're
going
to
have
a
drink
on
saturday
night.
and
it
took
a
different
approach
when
it
came
to
illegal
drugs.
it
said
where--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
issue
there
would
be
whether
that
undermined
the
deterrent
effect
of
the
testing
program.
in
other
words,
if
the
consequence
for
taking
drugs
and
putting
the
lives
of
the
traveling
public
at
risk
is
you
get
a
desk
job
rather
than
you're
behind
the
wheel,
that
would
undermine
what
congress
was
trying
to
do.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the...
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
in
other
words
a
second
positive
test,
not
the
first
test,
i
think
yes,
although
the
argument
for
public
policy
would
not
be
as
strong.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
was
just
going
to
emphasize
that
what
congress
sought
to
achieve,
and
what
the
department
of
transportation
is
seeking
to
achieve,
is
deterrence,
and
if
the
consequences
are
so
minimal,
as
in
your
honor's
hypothetical,
that
undermines
the
deterrent
effect.
how
do
the
other
drivers
who
are
subject
to
this
test
take
it
seriously,
when
they
see
someone
who's
failed
twice--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
we
don't
know
why
they
didn't
adopt
it.
they
may
not
have
adopted
it--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--because
they
thought
termination
was--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--because
when
you're
dealing
with
a
second
offense,
someone
who
failed
the
first
drug
test
they
had
to
take,
then
failed
another
one
given
14
months
after
they
were
reinstated,
after
they
had
been
through
the
rehabilitation
process,
we
tried
what
the
statute
and
the
regulations
provide,
and
it
didn't
work.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
assumption
underlying
your
question
is
that
the
regulation
somehow
occupies
the
field.
in
other
words,
they
addressed
the
whole
universe
of
situations
that
can
arise.
they
plainly
did
not.
there's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
would
suppose
because
neither
congress
nor
the
department
ever
supposed
you'd
have
an
arbitrator
who
would
reinstate
someone
who
failed
two
tests
within
15
months
to
this
type
of
a
position.
it's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
don't
want
to--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
not
aware
of
any,
and
i
don't
want
to
limit
what
the
company
will
be
arguing
in
the
future,
but
if
you
accept
the
interpretation
that
the
arbitrator's
decision
is
an
interpretation
of
the
contract,
i
don't
know
how
much
of
a
defense
that's
going
to
be.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
sure
that's
what
the
argument--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
sure
that's
what
the
argument
would
be.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
on
the
other
hand,
the
contract,
like
every
contract,
is
subject
to
the
public
policy
exception.
now,
it
is
an
exception
that
is
applicable
only
in
the
rare
case,
but
those
cases
do
come
up.
the
union
today
is
arguing
that
there's
no
role
for
the
courts
here,
but
in
the
jones
dairy
farm
case
it
was
a
union
that
was
arguing
for
the
public
policy
exception
against
the
management
rule
that
employees
had
to
report
unsanitary
conditions
only
to
management.
the
solicitor
general
is
arguing
against
the
exception
today,
but
when
it
was
a
federal
postal
worker
that
they
were
trying
to
fire
and
an
arbitrator
ordered
him
reinstated,
then
the
solicitor
general
was
saying
no,
the
court
should
vacate
that
arbitration
award.
these
situations
come
up
with
sufficient
regularity,
sometimes
the
shoe
is
on
one
foot
and
sometimes
on
the
other,
but
the
fact
of
the
public
policy
exception
has
to
be
recognized,
and
the
one
thing
that
is
clear,
it
seems,
is
that
the
lower
court
approach,
which
said
this
is
not
illegal,
therefore
there's
no
role
for
the
public
policy
exception,
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
decision.
the
formulation
has
always
been
the
public
policy
exception
applies
to
contracts
that
are
illegal
or
that
violate
public
policy,
and
with
respect--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no.
there
are
two--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
that's
what
the
court
said
in
town
of
newton,
and
i
think
it's
correct.
there
is
not
a
clear
line,
but
what
the
court
has
said...
and
there
are
two
aspects
to
the
question.
how
do
you
tell
what
the
policy
is,
how
do
you
tell
whether
it's
violated.
on
the
policy
question,
what
the
court
has
said
is,
it
has
to
be
well-defined,
and
you
have
to
point
to
the
laws
of
legal
precedents.
that's
satisfied
here.
the
definition
of
this
testing
program
is
spelled
out
in
detail
by
congress
and
the
department
of
transportation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
the
policy
of
the
testing
act.
congress
has
said
that,
and
that
is
the
policy
that
is
at
issue
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
the
regs
say,
according
to
the
solicitor
general,
and
we
agree,
is
that
it's
left
to
private
ordering,
and
if
it's
left
to
private
ordering
in
the
form
of
a
contract,
the
public
policy
exception
applies.
now,
that's
as
far
as
we
got
in
the
lower
courts.
then
the
lower
courts
said,
we're
not
going
to
look
at
it
because
it's
not
illegal.
one
reason
i
think
it
may
be
seen
difficult
to
manage
the
application
here
is
that
the
district
court
hasn't
done
it,
and
the
court
of
appeals
hasn't
done
it
in
this
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
an
important
limitation
on
this,
is
on
the
public
policy
exception,
which
is
that
it
only
applies
when
the
courts
are
asked
to
enforce
the
contract.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
wouldn't
be
making
the
court--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--he
wouldn't
be
making
the
court
an
accomplice
to
the
violation
of
public
policy.
he
would
be
restrained,
of
course,
by
tort
law.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
your
honor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
have
just
three
very
brief
points.
first,
the
lower
courts
did
not
address
the
questions
we
have
been
discussing
this
morning.
they
adopted
the
position
that
because
this
award
was
not
illegal,
the
public
policy
exception
does
not
apply.
i
understand
the
solicitor
general's
representative
to
agree
with
us
that
that
is
an
incorrect
statement
of
the
standard.
at
the
very
least,
then,
it
seems
appropriate
to
vacate
the
decision
and
send
it
back
for
the
lower
courts
to
at
least
apply
the
correct
standard.
second,
take
no
comfort
in
the
certification
of
the
substance
abuse
professional.
my
brother
for
the
union
said
that
he
certifies
that
the
employee
successfully
completed
rehabilitation.
that
is
not
correct.
all
that
the
substance
abuse
professional
certifies
is
that
the
employee
properly
followed
the
program,
not
that
it
worked,
not
that
it
was
likely
to
work,
and
certainly
not
that
the
employee
does
not
present
a
risk
to
the
public,
and
also
keep
in
mind
that
the
professional
obligation
of
the
sap
is
to
the
employee,
not
to
the
public
safety.
he
could
easily
determine
that
it's
best
for
this
employee
to
be
back
on
the
job,
even
if
that
represents
a
threat
to
public
safety.
finally,
you
can
look
through
the
regulations
in
excruciating
detail.
you
will
not
find
a
provision
addressing
the
problem
of
a
recidivist.
the
department
may
have
considered
some
things.
it
didn't
adopt
them.
it
seems
an
awful
lot
of
weight
to
place
on
the
failure
to
adopt
a
provision
to
conclude
that
someone
who
violates
these
rules
20
times
is
to
be
treated
exactly
like
someone
who
violates
it
one
time.
that
is
insufficient
to
protect
public
safety.
what
the
regulations
provide
is
that
this
issue,
reinstatement,
is
left
to
contract.
if
it
is
left
to
contract,
the
public
policy
exception
applies.
in
the
reported
cases
alone,
you
will
find
examples
of
arbitrators
ordering
the
reinstatement
of
nurses
who
prescribed
the
wrong
medication
and
stood
by
while
patients
were
dying,
the
helmsman
of
a
635-foot
oil
tanker
who
was
on
marijuana
and
ran
it
aground,
the
nuclear
plant
operator
who
diffused
the
safety
system
at
the
plant
so
he
could
leave
early
for
lunch,
and
the
pilot
of
a
727
who
flew
it
while
blind
drunk.
the
public
policy
exception
is
needed
for
those
types
of
cases,
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
case
of
a
driver
of
a
25-ton
vehicle
in
west
virginia
who
has
twice
failed
drug
tests
fits
in
that
category.
