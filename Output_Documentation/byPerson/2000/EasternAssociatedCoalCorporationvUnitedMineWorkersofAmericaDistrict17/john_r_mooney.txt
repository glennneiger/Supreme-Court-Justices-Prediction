mr.
john
r.
mooney
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
that
the
court
doesn't
need
to
reach
the
unanswered
question
in
footnote
12
of
misco
because
the
standard
that
the
court
announced
in
misco,
which
was
basically
affirmed
in
grace,
provides
ample
analytical
framework
for
this
court
and
any
court
to
analyze
this
case.
what
misco
taught
us
is
that
in
the
301
context,
a
court
may
refuse
to
enforce
an
arbitrator's
award
because
it
is
contrary
to
public
policy
if
and
only
if
it
violates
an
explicit
public
policy
that
is
well-defined
and
dominant,
and
is
ascertained
by
an
examination
of
laws
and
legal
precedents,
and
not
general
supposed
notions
of
public
interest.
only
if
there
is
an
explicit
conflict
with
the
public
relevant
public
policy
can
the
arbitration
award
or
contract
in
the
301
context
be
struck
down.
eastern
challenges
under
the
guise
of
public
policy
an
arbitration
award
that
was
rendered
pursuant
to
the
parties'
collective
bargaining
agreement,
which
reinstated
an
employee
who
had
tested
positive
for
marijuana.
the
policy
that
it
uses
is
the
policy
embodied
in
the
omnibus
transportation
employee
testing
act
of
1991
and
the
regulations
issued
by
the
department
of
transportation
pursuant
to
that
statute.
an
examination
of
the
statute
and
the
regulations
reveals
a
comprehensive
public
policy.
it
is
not
merely
deterrence.
it
is
not
merely
to
take
employees
out
of
driving
dangerous
vehicles,
although
we
agree
it
is
in
there.
it
also
has
a
statutory
purpose
of
rehabilitation
and
a
return
to
duty
for
these
employees.
the
basic
framework
of
the
statute,
as
we
see
it,
and
the
regs
issued
pursuant
to
that,
is
detection
of
these
employees,
removal
from
the
safety-sensitive
position--
mr.
john
r.
mooney
--i
would
disagree,
justice
scalia,
because
the
statute
specifically
refers
to
rehabilitating
these
employees,
and
that
was
one
of
the
policy
goals,
so
i
don't
view
it
as
a
separate
policy.
we
would
view
it
as
part
of
the
policy
embodied
in
the
statute
and
the
regulations,
and
of
course
there's
not
just
a
penal
aspect
to
the
regulations
that
we
have
here.
what
it
does
is
send
these
employees
to
a
substance
abuse
professional
who
must
evaluate
them,
develop
a
plan,
and
that
employee
must
successfully
complete
that
plan
prior
to
being
eligible
to
return.
mr.
john
r.
mooney
oh,
we
agree
with
that--
mr.
john
r.
mooney
--justice
scalia.
mr.
john
r.
mooney
your
honor,
what
we
would
do
is
go
back
to
the
framework
of
misco.
we
would
take
the
public
policy
as
established.
we
would
take
that
award,
which
includes
the
remedy
that
the
arbitrator
crafted,
and
in
the
balancing
of
all
the
circumstances,
apparently
the
arbitrator
in
your
situation
still
thought
it
was
appropriate
to
return
that
employee
to
duty.
mr.
john
r.
mooney
so
long
as
he
complies
with
the
statutory
and
regulatory
prerequisites,
and
so
long
as
that
remedy
is
within
the
scope
of
the
arbitrator's
commission,
we
believe
that
that
arbitration
award
should
be
enforced.
mr.
john
r.
mooney
well,
your
honor,
that's
what
we
would
posit
would
be
the
appropriate
standard.
that
really
goes
to
the
second
question,
which
is
the
unanswered
question
in
misco,
although
i
doubt
an
arbitrator
would
do
that,
and
i
am
not
aware
of
any
circumstance--
mr.
john
r.
mooney
--if
we
had
the
question
of
whether
it
draws
its
essence
from
the
contract
we
would
go
under
the
established
guidelines
since
enterprise
wheel,
and
perhaps
that
would
not
do
that.
we
think
the
law--
mr.
john
r.
mooney
--we
don't
quibble
with
the
jurisprudence
that
the
courts
have
developed
ever
since
enterprise
wheel.
we
think
the
courts
have
not
had
great
difficulty
in
following
that,
and
we
recognize
that
some
arbitration
awards
that
have
idiosyncratic
developments
have
been
struck
down,
vacated,
or
a
court's
refused
to
enforce
that.
mr.
john
r.
mooney
well,
we
would
view
the
misco
public
policy
exception
as
part
of
an
overall
deference
to
labor
arbitration,
the
301,
that
goes
back
to
lincoln
mills
and
then
comes
through
the
steelworkers
trilogy,
so
i
don't
know
if
there's...
how
you
would
attempt
to
analytically
put
that
in
a
box,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
john
r.
mooney
i'm
not
so
sure
it
would
be
more
clear,
but
i
think
it
would
be...
your
reference
still
goes
back
to
the
misco
analysis
when
someone
raises
public
policy...
when
someone
is
attempting
to
avoid
compliance
with
their
own
contract
by
reason
of
invocation
of
the
public
interest,
certainly
we
have
to
use
the
analytical
framework
developed
in
misco.
we
believe
that
that
framework
has
worked,
for
the
most
part.
we
think
it
should
be
affirmed
just
as
we
originally
had
it
in
grace,
and
we
see
what
happened
in
grace
is
that
the
court's
explicit
recognition
of
a
public
policy
exception
in
the
301
context
perhaps
encouraged
courts,
invigorated
them
to
look
at
labor
arbitration
awards
under
the
public
policy
exception,
and
the
court
had
to
come
back
in
misco
and
remind
all
of
us
what
it
meant
in
the
grace
decision,
and
we
think
that
the
misco
standard--
mr.
john
r.
mooney
--is
still
perfectly
applicable.
mr.
john
r.
mooney
the
difficulty
i
have,
justice
kennedy,
is
whenever
you
look
at
the
question
of,
does
it
draw
its
essence
from
the
contract,
you
must
examine
the
contract.
mr.
john
r.
mooney
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
articulated
better
than
what
i
was
trying
to
say,
is
that
in
a
enterprise
wheel
case
the
first
duty
the
court
would
look
at
in
an
arbitration
award
would
be,
what
is
the
labor
contract?
is
there
a
just
cause
provision?
are
there
strictures
on
the
commission
of
the
arbitrator?
that's
the
first
line
of
inquiry.
those
really
don't
come
in
under
the
misco
analysis
as
directly
as
under
the
enterprise
wheel
analysis.
misco
says
that
there
must
be
an
articulated,
well-defined,
dominant
public
policy
in
the
laws
and
legal
precedents,
and
only
if
that
policy
is
violated
by
the
award
can
it
be
struck
down
in
the
301
context.
mr.
john
r.
mooney
justice
o'connor,
we
certainly
do,
and
we
look
to
that
policy
as
articulated
perhaps
best
by
the
policymaker
itself
in
this
area,
which
is
the
department
of
transportation.
the
policymaker
itself
has
told
us
how
that
policy
is
to
work
in
situations
like
mr.
smith's.
mr.
john
r.
mooney
i
part
company
with
mr.
roberts
in
analyzing
that
question.
the
question
of
repeat
offenders,
recidivists,
was
considered
by
the
agency
in
its
rule-making.
initially
there
was
a
proposal
that
would
have
a
sanction
for
a
second
offense
of
a
60-day
period
outside
the
safety-sensitive
position,
or
removal
from
work,
suspension.
after
receiving
comments,
the
agency
did
not
adopt
that
standard.
what
it
did
do
is
remind
us
that
the
sanction
for
failing
the
rehab
program,
which
is
in
essence
what
happened,
is
the
same
as
in
alcohol
testing,
which
is
you
will
be
removed,
rehabilitated,
and
eligible
for
return
to
service.
mr.
john
r.
mooney
your
honor,
we
would
read
the
award
as
stating
that
mr.
smith
was
to
return
to
work
on
october
20
of
that
year.
if
he
had
satisfactorily
completed
the
program,
as
he
had,
to
return
to
the
safety-sensitive
position,
we
would
say
he
should
get
that
position.
if
he
has
not
completed
that
program,
our
reading
would
be
that
he
return
to
employment
consistent
with
the
other
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
john
r.
mooney
that's
our
reading
of
the
award,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
mr.
smith,
once
he
satisfies
the
prerequisites
contained
in
the
statute,
which
is
referral
to
the
sap,
completion
of
that
process,
successful
evaluation
by
the
sap,
and
then
a
return-to-duty
test,
which
he
has
not
taken...
he
was
ready,
willing
and
able
to
take
it.
once
he
satisfies
all
of
those
prerequisites,
he
should
be
able
to
return
to
his
meo
job.
mr.
john
r.
mooney
we
would
disagree,
justice
scalia.
we
believe
that
the
agency
has
not
precluded
these
employees
from
coming
back
once
they've
satisfied
the
statutory
prerequisites,
but
the
hypothetical
that
you
posit
would
probably
be
a
vehicle
for
the
court
to
address
the
question
that
it
did
not
reach
in
misco,
which
is
reserved
in
footnote
12.
mr.
john
r.
mooney
we
believe,
as
the
union
did
in
misco,
that
the
appropriate
standard
in
that
case,
justice
kennedy,
would
be
that
unless
the
contract
or
the
award
giving
life
to
that
contract
violates
positive
law,
it
should
be
enforced,
and
we
have
several
reasons
for
why
we
view
that
that
is
the
appropriate
standard
if
the
court
was
to
need
to
reach
it.
mr.
john
r.
mooney
justice
ginsburg,
we
think
to
answer
this
case,
there's
only
four
places
the
court
needs
to
look.
one
is
the
misco
decision
for
the
analytical
guidelines
on
how
to
evaluate
public
policy
challenges
in
the
301
context.
two,
we
need
to
look
to
the
dot
regulations,
which
give
us
the
public
policy
that
we
are
looking
for.
three
would
be
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
which
authorizes
an
arbitrator
to
make
these
sort
of
just
cause
decisions,
and
the
fourth
would
be
arbitrator
barrett's
award.
if
you
view
the
award
through
the
prism
of
misco,
it's
clear
that
the
award
should
be
enforced.
we
think
that
that's
how
easily
this
case
can
be
resolved.
but
if
the
court
does
intend
to
reach
the
second
question,
we
believe
it
is
important
that
the
court
analyze
this
within
the
section
301
jurisprudence.
the
policies
that
animate
301
have
been
well-established
since
lincoln
mills
back
in
19--
mr.
john
r.
mooney
--your
honor,
we
would
view
301
as
distinct.
as
we
understand
the
common
law
notion,
the
courts,
whatever
powers
they
may
have,
had
under
the
public
policy
exception,
they
did
not
act
in
a
position
in
contradiction
to
the
legislature.
the
legislature
is
the
traditional
body
that
establishes
public
policy.
in
enacting
the
national
labor
relations
act,
we
believe
that
the
legislature,
congress,
did
establish
the
public
policy.
if
you
look
at
sections
171
and
173
of
title
29,
it's
201
and
203
of
the
act,
it
clearly
tells
us
that
labor
contracts
really
are
something
different
than
commercial
contracts.
we
are
balancing
public
policy
of
collective
bargaining,
telling
the
bargaining
parties
that
they
should
privately
order
their
own
affairs,
and
so
long
as
what
they
do
is
lawful,
we're
not
going
to
interfere
with
that.
mr.
john
r.
mooney
your
honor,
we
believe
that
arbitrators
routinely
take
into
account
those
considerations,
the
examination
of
external
law.
as
the
national
academy
points
out
on
pages
18
to
20
of
its
submission
to
the
court
as
amicus
on
our
behalf,
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
numerous
arbitrators
do
and,
indeed,
arbitrator
barrett
did
here.
so
long
as
the
arbitrator
is
staying
true
to
his
commission
he
can
and
should
look
at
those
other
considerations.
that's
why
people
select
the
arbitrators,
is
they
have
the
specialized
judgment,
as
the
court
recognized
in
gateway
coal,
to
resolve
those
questions.
certainly
an
arbitrator
can
look
at
those
external
sources
and
use
the
benefit
of
those
to
craft
a
remedy.
mr.
john
r.
mooney
the
background
of
our
case,
justice
scalia,
is
that
the
public,
the
balancing
of
these
competing
interests
has
been
drawn
by
the
department
of
transportation.
they
were
the
agency
delegated
by
congress
responsibility
for
enfurthering
the
testing
act
procedures
in
conformance
with
the
goal
of
highway
safety.
that
agency
draw
the
balance.
it
accommodated
and
acknowledged
both
the
interest
of
the
public
and
the
safety
of
the
highways
and
the
interests
of
the
employees
in
being
rehabilitated
and
returned
to
service,
and
the
interest
of
employers.
they
drew
that
balance.
it
drew
that
balance.
perhaps
we
would
quibble
with
that,
but--
mr.
john
r.
mooney
--we
don't
believe
we
should
second
guess
it.
