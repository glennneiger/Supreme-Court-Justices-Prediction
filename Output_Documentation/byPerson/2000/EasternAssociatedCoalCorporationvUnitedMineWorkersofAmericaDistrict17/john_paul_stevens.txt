how
does
the
policy
differentiate
between
two
strikes
and
three
strikes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean
any...
one
judge
might
say,
well,
one
strike's
enough
for
me,
that's
the
end
of
the
ball
game?
justice
john
paul
stevens
another
judge
might
say,
two
strikes,
and
still
another
might
say
three
strikes.
how
do
we
know
which
is
the
right
number?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whenever
the
policy
applies,
i
take
it
it
trumps
the
contract.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question,
following
up
on
some
of
justice
scalia's?
do
you
think
there's
a
public
policy
that
would
require
arbitrators
in
cases
such
as
this
to
assess
the
likelihood
of
recidivism
in
the
future?
