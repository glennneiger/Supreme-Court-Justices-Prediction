justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i
want
to
get
into
that,
but
just
before
we
leave
this
last
question,
if
the
company
had
a
contract
that
said
three
strikes
and
you're
out,
would
that
contradict
public...
but
not
two
and
not
one,
would
that
contradict
public
policy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
contract
says
three
strikes
and
you're
out,
not
two,
not
one.
then
on
the
second
time
the
employer
comes
and
says,
well,
you
know,
this
violates
public
policy,
we
want
him
out.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
would
be
a
valid
argument
by
the
employer.
in
other
words,
he--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--there
is
in
your
view
a
public
policy
which
would
prohibit
a
three
strikes
clause
of
the
kind
i
describe?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
roberts,
could
you
comment
on
the
potential
civil
liability
of
the
employer?
are
there
cases...
let's
assume
an
accident
with
a
person
who's
previously
tested
positive.
i
take
it
the
employer
would
be
liable
for
punitive
damages
if
he
took
no
steps
to
terminate
the
employee.
if
the
arbitrator
orders
the
reinstatement,
i
take
it
that
would
be
a
defense
against
punitive
damages.
are
there
any--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--are
there
any
cases
on
this
in
the
lower
courts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
it
easier
for
the
courts
to
say,
a)
that
it's
against
public
policy,
or
b)
that
it
does
not
draw
its
essence
from
the
contract?
which
is
the
more
precise
doctrine?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
had
thought
justice
breyer's
question
suggested
that
there
might
be
another
way
to
answer
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
by
saying,
oh,
well,
this
doesn't
draw
its
essence
from
the
contract,
and
i'm
asking
you
if
that's
any
more
precise,
any
more
clear,
any
more
categorically
manageable
from
the
standpoint
of
appellate
review
than
the
public
policy
is.
it
seems
to
me
it
might
not
be.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--let
us
assume
that
justice
breyer's
question
suggests
the
possibility
that
the
standard
of
not
drawing
the
award
from
the
essence
of
the
contract
gives
the
courts
more
latitude
than
the
public
policy
argument
to
set
aside
arbitrators'
awards.
would
you
agree
with
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
we're
asking
you
how
the
court
should
answer
that
question.
