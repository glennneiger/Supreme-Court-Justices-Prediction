justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why,
mr.
roberts,
because
you
could
have
said
expressly,
you
didn't
have
to
as
a
contracting
party
rely
on
what
a
court
might
or
might
not
declare
to
be
the
public
policy.
could
you
have
not
said,
a
driver
gets
tested
and
shows
up
positive
twice,
he's
out.
you
could
have
said
that.
you
could
have
negotiated
for
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
didn't,
you
didn't
do
that,
or
we
don't
know.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
i'm
just
trying
to
make
the
narrow
point
that
an
employer
could
bargain
for
a
rule
that
says
you
test
positive
for
drugs
twice,
and
you're
out,
could
bargain
for
such
a
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
then
it
would
make
that
academic
or
moot
if
you
had
it
in
the
contract.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
are
such
contracts,
as
i
understand
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--are
there
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they'd
make
it
explicit
where
the
first
time,
second
time,
you're
out,
period.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
in
other
words,
what
you're
seeking,
then,
would
be
a
rule
that
says
the
public
policy
kicks
in
if
the
employer
wants
to
discharge
this
person,
but
suppose
the
employer
would
say,
we're
going
to
give
him
a
second
chance,
even
a
third
chance,
there
would
be
no
public
policy
to
come
into
that
picture.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
other
words
you
are
saying
the
bottom
line
rule
that
you're
urging
is
that
you
ought
to
be
permitted,
if
you
so
choose,
to
discharge
this
man,
but
if
you
do
not
so
choose,
then
there's
no...
there's
nothing
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts,
may
i
ask
you
if
the
arbitrator
had
left
leeway
to
the
employer
to
put
this
person
in
a
nonsafety
sensitive
job,
then
would
you
say,
well...
what
would
you
say
about
public
policy
then?
the...
everything
is
the
same,
that
he
gets
stopped
10,000
or
whatever
it
was
pay,
and
he
has
to
go
through
the
drug
rehabilitation
program,
and
at
the
end
of
the
line
the
employer
can
put
him
back
in
a
nonsafety
sensitive
position.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
the
public...
would
the
argument...
in
other
words,
you're
telling
me
that
the
public
policy
as
you
perceive
it
would
say,
this
person
is
out,
even
if
there's
a
nonsafety
sensitive
job
that
he
could
be
given?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
agree
it
wouldn't
be
illegal,
because
you...
in
answer
to
my
question
you
said
if
the
employer
wants
to
keep
this
person
on,
he
could.
it
wouldn't
be
violating
any
law
or
regulation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
return
to
what
service?
that
was
a
question
that
i
asked
mr.
roberts,
and
i'm
not
sure
what
the
situation
is
in
this
very
case.
as
you
understand
the
arbitrator's
award,
is
there
instruction
that
after
the
rehabilitation
period
this
man
is
to
be
returned
to
the
job
of
driver,
or
consistent
with
that
award
could
the
company
give
him
work
in
a
nonsafety-sensitive
position?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
think
then
you're
going
beyond
the
award,
but
you've
been
very
candid,
i
think,
if
i
understand
what
you
said,
that
this
award
says
if
he
passes
the
rehabilitation
course
he
goes
back
in
the
driver's
post.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
say
we
shouldn't
reach
it
because
this
case
doesn't
stretch
that
far,
because
here
the
arbitrator
said
this
man
has
given
me
a
very
special
reason.
i
believe
him.
i
think
that
he's
off
drugs
except
there
was
this
terrible
thing,
and
i
believe
him,
and
i...
that's
why
i'm
going
to
give
him
one
more
chance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stewart,
do
you
think
that
there
is
a
difference
and
that
public
policy
overrides,
say,
something
that
would
just
come
under
the
faa,
a
question
the
chief
asked,
say
a
consumer
contract
that's
drawn
by
the
seller,
and
that's
dictated
the
contract,
and
a...
adding
on
top
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract
public
policy
in
the
case
of
a...
of
an
employer-union
negotiated
contract?
