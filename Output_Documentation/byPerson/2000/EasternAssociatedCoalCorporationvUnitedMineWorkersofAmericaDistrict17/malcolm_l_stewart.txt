mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
arbitrator
in
this
case
treated
the
employee's
drug
use
as
a
serious
offense.
he
considered
it
worthy
of
serious
punishment.
with
respect
to
those
aspects
of
the
arbitrator's
decision,
the
petitioner
really
has
no
complaint.
petitioner
contends
that
the
arbitrator's
award
is
contrary
to
public
policy
only
in
that
the
arbitrator
chose
to
impose
a
suspension
of
slightly
over
3
months
plus
costs
of
the
arbitration
in
lieu
of
outright
discharge,
and
therefore
the
question
is
whether
the
punishment
imposed
by
the
arbitrator
can
reliably
be
said
to
conflict
with
public
policy.
this
court
emphasized
in
misco
that
a
court
asked
to
vacate
an
arbitral
award
in
the
labor
context
on
the
basis
of
public
policy
must
draw
that
policy
from
positive
law,
from
statutes
and
regulations.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
would
say
that
there
are
limited
circumstances
under
which
an
arbitral
award
can
be
vacated
even
though
the
award
would
not
compel
the
employer
to
violate
positive
law,
and
to
give
you
a
hypothetical
example,
the
department
of
transportation
has
a
regulation
that
says
that
a
driver
who
is
convicted
of
driving
under
the
influence
is
disqualified
from
operating
a
commercial
motor
vehicle
for
a
period
of
1
year.
now,
in
a
hypothetical
case
in
which
an
employee
was
believed
to
have
driven
under
the
influence,
was
not
convicted,
but
conceded
at
the
arbitral
proceeding
that
he
had,
in
fact,
driven
while
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
and
drugs,
in
such
a
case,
if
the
arbitrator
imposed
a
3-month
suspension
and
then
put
the
person
back
behind
the
wheel,
that
would
not
literally
compel
the
employer
to
violate
positive
law
because
there
would
be
no
conviction.
but
given
that
there
was
an
alternative
basis
for
feeling
highly
confident
that
the
prohibited
conduct
had
occurred,
such
an
award
would
be
explicable
only
on
the
ground
that
the
arbitrator
disagreed
with
the
policy
judgment
reflected
in
the
dot
regulations.
but
we
do...
while
we
don't
think
that
the
vacatur
of
the
award
is
limited
to
those
situations
in
which
a
violation
of
positive
law
would
otherwise
occur,
we
do
think
that
the
relevant
public
policy
must
be
drawn
directly
from
positive
law,
and
therefore
the
question
is,
is
there
anything
in
the
testing
act
or
the
dot
regulations
that
identifies
discharge
as
the
mandatory
penalty
for
a
second
drug
offense
or
not,
and
in
our
view
there's
no
way
that
the
regulations
or
the
statute
can
fairly
be
read
to
compel
that
conclusion.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
that's
correct--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--and
i
think
the
dot
reg...
but
i
think
the
dot
regulations--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--we
wouldn't
say
that,
because
in
our
view
the
dot
regulations
provide
an
alternative
basis
for
preventing
that,
that
feared
result
from
occurring.
that
is,
regardless
of
whether
the
arbitrator
orders
this
person
reinstated,
the
person
is
not
eligible
under
the
regulations
to
drive
a
commercial
vehicle
until
he
complies
with
dot's
rehabilitation
requirements.
and
if
he's
evaluated
by
the
substance
abuse
professional,
if
the
substance
abuse
professional
certifies
that
he
has
complied
with
the
recommended
course
of
treatment
and
that
the
employer
is
therefore
legally
free
to
employ
him
again
in
driving
a
truck,
that
provides
the
basis
for
assurance
that
a
person
who
poses
a
substantial
risk
will
not
be
on
the
roads,
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
sap's,
as
we
refer
to
them,
are
not...
they're
not
certified
by
the
department
of
transportation,
but
the
regulations
do
specify
the
categories
of
people
who
are
eligible
to
perform
this
service,
and
the
regulations
also
make
clear
that
the
choice
of
a
particular
sap
is
up
to
the
employer
unless
the
employer
has
delegated
that
power
away
through
collective
bargaining
agreement,
so
the
employer
has
the
ultimate
power
to
ensure
that
this
important
decision
is
not
being
entrusted
to
someone,
somebody
that
the
employer
believes
is
insufficiently
protective
of
the
public
safety.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
we
would
certainly
agree
with
the
chief
justice
that
there
is
also
a
strong
policy
reflected
in
the
language
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
in
favor
of
enforcement
of
arbitration
agreements
in
the
commercial
context.
there
is
in
the
labor
context
the
additional
consideration
of
preserving
industrial
peace,
but
we
don't...
i
don't
know
that
we
would
say
that
the
two
are
different
in
kind.
now,
certainly
in
the
state
system
it
is
up
to
a
state
government
to
determine
how
it
wants
to
allocate
power
among
the
branches,
and
therefore
state
courts
may
assume
far
greater
authority
to
devise
public
policy
to
set
aside
contracts
that
violate
it
even
if
they
aren't
drawing
the
relevant
public
policy
from
positive
law.
that's
up
to
the
state
system.
but
within
the
federal
system
i
think
even
whether
within
the
faa,
or
under
the
labor
management
statutes,
there
is
a
strong
policy
in
favor
of
enforcement
of
contractual
choices.
and
so
in
1992
to
1994
the
department
of
transportation
conducted
an
extensive
rule-making,
it
heard
comments
from
a
number
of
interested
people,
and
its
mandate
from
congress
was
to
consider
both
the
need
to
protect
the
public
safety
against
the
ill
effects
of
transportation
employees
who
use
drugs,
and
the
testing
act
also
included
a
congressional
finding
that
rehabilitation
is
a
critical
component
of
any
testing
program.
and
it
was
the
department's
mandate
to
balance
those
potentially
competing
objectives,
and
specifically
with
respect
to
the
problem
of
a
recidivist
drug
user,
the
initial
regulation
proposed
by
the
department
of
transportation
would
have
mandated
a
60-day
disqualification
period.
and
i
think,
as
justice
breyer
suggested,
part
of
the
irony
of
this
case
is
that
if
that
provision
had
been
adopted,
we
think
the
petitioner
would
have
no
basis
for
challenging
the
arbitral
award
here,
because
if
dot
had
said,
suspension
of
at
least
60
days,
and
the
arbitrator
had
imposed
a
suspension
of
a
little
over
3
months--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
it
all
depends
on
what
powers
the
parties
elect
to
confer
upon
the
arbitrator.
that
is,
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
specified
that
the
punishment
for
a
first
positive
drug
test
will
be
a
30-day
suspension
followed
by
reinstatement
if
the
individual
has
complied
with
the
dot
regulations,
i
think
there
would
be
no
room
under
the
contract
for
the
arbitrator
to
say,
i'm
not
sufficiently
confident
that
this
person
can
do
the
job
again,
and
therefore
i'm
ordering
him
discharged.
and
conversely,
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
said,
anybody
who
violates
the
drug
policy
twice
will
be
dismissed,
the
arbitrator
wouldn't
have
authority
to
determine
that
really
the
policy
in
favor
of
rehabilitation
was
more
important
and
therefore
he
should
be
given
another
chance.
but
where,
as
here,
we
have
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
gives
the
arbitrator
very
broad
discretion
to
decide
whether
there
is
just
cause
in
a
particular
case,
we
think
the
arbitrator
would
naturally
look
to
public
policy
considerations,
among
others.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
and
it
would
depend
upon
the
authority
entrusted
to
him--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--by
the
parties.
and
so
the
department
of
transportation
considered
a
provision
that
would
have
imposed
a
mandatory
60-day
suspension
for
recidivists.
it
seemed
clear
to
us
that
if
that
provision
had
been
adopted,
the
90-day-plus
suspension
that
was
imposed
here
couldn't
be
said
to
violate
public
policy,
and
although
it's
not
terribly
clear
from
the
federal
register
notice
exactly
why
the
department
declined
to
adopt
that
provision,
it's
very
clear
that
the
department
understood
that
the
consequence
of
deleting
that
proposed
rule
was
to
leave
to
the
contracting
parties
the
determination
whether
reinstatement
would
occur
even
after
a
second
positive
test.
that
is
the
public
policy
as
determined
by
the
department
of
transportation.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--not
that
i'm
aware
of.
