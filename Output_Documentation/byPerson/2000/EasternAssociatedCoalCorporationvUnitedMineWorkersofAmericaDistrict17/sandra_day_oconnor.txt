mr.
roberts,
did
the
company
have
any
provision
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
about
what
it
was
going
to
do
for
positive
drug
testing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
you
read
department
of
transportation
regulations
on
this?
they're
quite
extensive,
and
as
i
read
them
it
doesn't
expressly
cover
what
happens
for
a
second
violation.
there
was
a
proposal
to
do
something
that
i
guess
they
didn't
adopt.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
is
it
within
the
provisions
of
the
regulations
actually
adopted
that
an
employee
could
be
restored
to
driving
a
truck
under
these
circumstances?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
after
a--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it
just
doesn't
say.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
do
you...
do
we
say
there's
a
firm
public
policy
that
a
repeat
offender
may
not
be
restored
to
a
job
affecting
public
safety?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
the
policy?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how...
and
do
we
look
to
the
dot
regs
as
part
of
that
determination?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
dot
has
indicated
that
at
least
on
the
first
offense
there
can
be
reinstatement,
and
the
regs
are
silent
on
the
repeat
offense,
so
what
do
we
make
of
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
you
do
acknowledge
that
there
is
a
general
public
policy
against
having
people
who
use
prohibited
drugs
from
driving
dangerous
vehicles.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--does
the
record
tell
us
where
mr.
smith
is
working
today,
and
at
what
job?
