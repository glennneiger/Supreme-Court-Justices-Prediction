justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
in
this
case,
then,
to
get
right
to
the
facts
of
it,
which...
facts
intensive,
we
assume
that
the
parties
agreed
that
an
appropriate
remedy
for
a
person
who
is
found
with
marijuana
twice,
and
there
are
extenuating
circumstances,
is
a
10,000
fine,
in
effect,
and
rehabilitation,
and
reinstatement
if
he
tests
negative.
now,
how
can
we
say
that's
against
public
policy?
if
you
were
in
california
the
criminal
law
provides
the
most
severe
penalty
that
could
be
attached
to
a
second
possession
of
26
grams
is
a
100
fine.
so
here
we
have
30
million
people
in
the
state
of
california
saying
a
100
fine
is
the
appropriate
thing.
in
west
virginia,
i
take
the
highest
fine
would
have
been
1,000
under
the
criminal
law.
and
now
here,
the
arbitrator
says
it's
going
to
be
10,000
and
testing
negative,
rehabilitation,
reinstatement,
so
how
could
we
say
in
this
case
it's
against
public
policy
and
he
has
to
be
fired?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
10,000
is
minimal?
i
mean,
if
the
department
of
transportation
had
adopted
its
reg
that
favors
your
position,
i
take
it
they
would
have
insisted
on
a
60-day
suspension.
they
didn't
even
adopt
it,
but
if
it
had
been
adopted,
then
it
would
have
been
satisfied
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
i
see,
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was...
that's
true.
what
about
10,000
dollars?
i
mean,
why
is
10,000
dollars
in
light...
if
you
went
across
the
country,
why
is
10,000
dollars
a
minimal...
a
minimal
sanction
for
an
ordinary
worker
who
is
a
driver
of
a
truck?
that
sounds
like
a
lot
of
money
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
suppose
an
arbitrator
did
do
that
for
a
transportation
company.
he
says,
i
think
this
guy
is
going
to
drive
around
getting
into
an
accident
with
earth-moving
equipment,
but
i'm
still
going
to
send
him
back
to
his
job.
do
you
think
an
award
like
that
would
draw
its
essence
from
the
contract?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
if
it
would
not
do
that...
i
mean,
it's
an
awfully
odd
award
that
a
transportation
company
has
to
hire
back
somebody
who
they
think
is
going
to
get
into
an
accident.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
eastern
associated
coal
corporation
has
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
united
mine
workers.
that
agreement
provides
that
eastern
must
have
“just
cause”
to
dismiss
a
worker.
the
agreement
also
provides
for
arbitration
of
disputes
about
“just
what”
constitutes
“just
cause”.
james
smith,
a
truck
driver
employed
by
eastern
twice
failed
drug
testing
for
marijuana.
eastern
wanted
to
dismiss
him,
but
each
time
an
arbitrator
imposed
an
alternative
punishment
upon
smith
and
then
held,
in
light
of
that
punishment,
eastern
did
not
have
“just
cause”
to
dismiss
smith.
eastern
ask
the
court
in
effect
the
set-aside
the
arbitrator’s
second
reinstatement.
eastern
claims
that
on
the
arbitrator’s
interpretation
of
the
words
“just
cause”
the
contract
is
unenforceable,
because
if
the
contract
requires
it
to
reinstate
a
worker
who
failed
drug
tests
twice
the
contract
must
violate
public
policy.
the
fourth
circuit
rejected
eastern’s
public
policy
argument.
other
courts
in
similar
circumstances
have
reached
the
different
conclusion.
we
therefore
agreed
to
review
the
matter.
now,
we
agree
that
with
eastern
that
in
principle
a
court
might
sometimes
refuse
to
enforce
an
agreement
on
public
policy
grounds
even
if
enforcement
does
not
violate
a
positive
law
such
as
the
statute,
but
that
is
as
far
as
our
agreement
with
eastern
guvs.
the
public
policy
exception
warranting
non-enforcement
of
a
labor
arbitration
award
is
narrow.
it
is
applicable
only
where
the
public
policy
that
the
contract
violates
is
“explicit”,
“well-defined”,
“dominant”
and
“ascertain”
by
a
reference
to
the
laws
and
legal
precedents,
not
from
general
considerations
of
supposed
public
interests.
eastern’s
drug
testing
of
smith
is
subject
to
a
detailed
statute
and
regulations
governing
the
drug
testing
of
transportation
workers,
that
being
so
that
is
congress
and
the
executive
branch
both
having
spoken,
courts
must
treat
with
particular
caution,
any
plea
to
divine
some
further
public
policy
beyond
what
the
statute
and
regulations
explicitly
state.
eastern
is
making
just
such
a
plea
here,
the
statute
and
regulations
do
not
explicitly
forbid
an
employer
to
reinstate
a
worker
who
tests
positives
for
drugs
once
or
twice.
indeed,
as
we
read
them
they
contemplate
that
reinstatement
may
take
place
after
the
worker
has
been
rehabilitated.
eastern
claims
that
the
arbitrator’s
award
violates
the
public
policy
underlying
the
statute
the
policy
against
drug
use
by
workers
in
jobs
that
can
propose
a
risk
to
others.
but
that
claim
over
simplifies
the
regulatory
scheme,
the
actual
statute
in
the
regulations
reveal
several
different
relevant
policies,
including
policies
against
drug
use,
policies
favoring
drug
testing,
policies
favoring
rehabilitation
of
those
who
failed
tests
and
background
policies
favoring
leaving
disciplinary
matters
such
as
this
one
to
employers
and
unions
to
decide
to
agreed
upon
arbitration.
we
conclude
that
smith’s
reinstatement
with
a
significant
alternative
punishment
does
not
run
contrary
to
these
statutory
and
regulation
based
public
policies
taken
together.
we
spell
our
reasons
out
further,
in
our
opinion.
we
affirm
the
fourth
circuit's
similar
determination.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
which
justice
thomas
has
joined.
