justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
would
be
the
company's
own
fault.
they
signed
the
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
like
saying
that
when
you
have
a
criminal
law
that
provides
sending
a
person
who
commits
a
certain
crime
to
prison
for
only
10
years
there
are
two
policies
involved,
one
that
he
should
be
punished
for
doing
whatever
he
did
wrong,
and
secondly
that
such
people
should
be
released
after
10
years,
and
i
don't
know
that
that's
a
public
policy.
i
mean,
it's
just
a
limitation
upon
the
first
public
policy.
i
don't
know
that
i
would
express
it
to
be
a
policy
in
and
of
itself
that
there
should
be
rehabilitation
of
people,
and
that
people
who
have
violated
proscriptions
against
the
use
of
illegal
drugs
and
driving
dangerous
vehicles,
we
want
these
people
to
be
rehabilitated.
i
don't
see
that
as
a
policy
in
and
of
itself.
it's
simply
a
limitation
on
the
other
policy.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
ask
you
this.
do
you
contest
that
it
is
a
clearly
defined
public
policy
that
persons
as
to
whom
there
is
a
substantial
risk
because
of
prior
drug
use,
that
they
will
be
under
the
influence
of
drugs
when
driving
dangerous
vehicles,
should
not
be
behind
the
wheels
of
such
vehicles?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
what
if
a...
an
arbitrator
under
an
arbitration
clause
such
as
this
said
in
his
award,
i
really
think
there
is
a
substantial
risk
that
this
person
will
use
drugs
again
and
perhaps
drive
a
vehicle
while
he's
still
under
the
influence
of
drugs
again.
nonetheless,
despite
that
substantial
risk,
i
think
we
should
give
him
another
chance.
would
you
allow
a
federal
district
court
to
set
aside
that
arbitration
decision?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
thought
so
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
a
substantial
risk
that
he
would
endanger
the
public
again
by
being
under
the
influence
of
drugs
again.
he
says
that
explicitly.
i
acknowledge
there's
a
substantial
risk
that
this
will
happen,
but
i
think...
i'm
a
tender-hearted
fellow...
he
should
be
reinstated
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
know
what
there
is
left
of
the
public
policy
exception
if
you
allow
an
arbitrator
to
essentially
disregard
it.
you
acknowledge
it's
a
public
policy
not
to
undertake
that
substantial
risk.
the
arbitrator
says
there
is
that
substantial
risk,
but
you
nevertheless
say
we're
going
to
let
the
arbitrator
under
the
contract
force
the
employer
to
put
the
man
back
on
the
road.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
read
it
that
way,
too.
that's
the
only
way
to
understand
why
he
should
have
to
be
rehabilitated.
he
can
still
be
a
pot-head
and
do
a
desk
job
as
far
as
public
policy
is
concerned,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
make
him
go
through
the
rehabilitation
if
you're
not
looking
to
his
driving
a
rig
again?
so
i
agree
with
you
on
the
interpretation
of
the
award,
but
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
think
that
the
secretary,
by
not
addressing
recidivists,
is
in
effect
saying
recidivism
doesn't
matter.
it
seems
to
me
the
fact
that
they
didn't
apply
automatic
disqualification
for
recidivism
only
means,
you
know,
there
are
all
sorts
of
circumstances
that
may
exist,
and
we're
not
willing
to
say
categorically
that
somebody
can
never
come
back,
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
question,
certainly,
whether,
when
you
have
a
person
whom...
in
my
hypothetical,
the
arbitrator
acknowledges
that
there
is
significant
risk
that
this
person
will
be
under
the
influence
of
drugs
again
behind
the
wheel.
when
the
arbitrator
finds
that
and
nonetheless
puts
him
back
behind
the
wheel,
public
policy
isn't
violated.
i
don't
think
the
failure
of
the
regs
to
address
that
situation
is
anything
except
silence.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
arbitrator...
is
the
arbitrator
under
an
obligation,
or,
indeed,
to
your
knowledge
does
the
arbitrator
as
a
routine
matter
take
into
account
public
policy?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
trouble
is,
you
know,
the
court
represents
the
public,
and
that's
how
the
court
can
apply
the
public
policy
exception.
the
arbitrator
at
best
represents
both
the
parties,
so
you're
giving
over
the
protection
of
this
public
policy
to
the
parties.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
can't
compel
that
conclusion,
but
wouldn't
you
say
it's
part
of
the
public
policy,
a
clear
part
of
the
public
policy,
that
a...
that
where
there
is
a
substantial
possibility
that
a
person
who
has
been
a
drug
user
will
be
under
the
influence
of
drugs
while
driving,
that
person
should
not
be
put
behind
the
wheel?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
would
acknowledge
that
if
the
arbitrator's
finding
in
this
case
could
be
characterized
as
ignoring
that
substantial
possibility,
it
could
be
set
aside?
justice
antonin
scalia
who
are
these
substance
abuse
professionals
who
have
the
unfortunate
acronym
sap's?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
get
a
certificate
as
a
sap,
or
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
would
say
he
would
sometimes
make
the
public
policy
determination,
but
not
necessarily
always.
justice
antonin
scalia
under
the
agreements--
