chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
99-1038,
the
eastern
associated
coal
corporation
v.
united
mine
workers
of
america.
mr.
roberts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
roberts,
you've
referred
to
the
public
policy
exception
several
times.
would
you
state
your
version
of
the
public
policy
exception?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
just
kind
of
boiler
plate.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
how
would
you...
can
you
amplify
it
at
all?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
look
to
for...
now,
you've
talked
about
the
dot
regulations,
which
obviously
have
some...
are
there
other
sources
to
be
relied
on
here?
you
say
something
about
the
congressional...
in
testing--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
roberts,
do
you
agree
that
an
arbitrator's
decision
arbitrating
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
somehow
entitled
to
more
weight
than
an
arbitrator
interpreting
a
provision
under
the
federal
arbitration
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
would
be
a
matter
of
west
virginia
law
in
this
case,
i
take
it,
if
an
accident
occurred
in
west
virginia.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
mooney,
we'll
hear
from
you.
the
second
question
presented
is,
should
arbitration
awards
be
vacated
on
public
policy
grounds
only
when
the
award
itself
violates
positive
law
or
requires
unlawful
conduct
by
the
employer?
sometime
in
your
argument,
will
you
tell
us
your
position
on
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
another
difficulty
that
you...
it's...
drawing
its
essence
from
the
contract
is
very
contract-specific,
whereas
presumably
the
public
policy
thing
might
be
more
general?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
mr.
roberts
says
that
that
policy
is
silent
as
to
what
should
be
done
to
recidivists.
now,
do
you
agree
with
that
or
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
301
be
more
dominant
than
the
federal
arbitration
act?
both
encourage
great
deference
to
arbitrators.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mooney.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
stewart,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
stewart,
what's
the
government's
position
on
question
2
that's
presented?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
roberts,
you
have
4
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-1038,
eastern
associated
coal
corporation
versus
united
mine
workers,
will
be
announced
by
justice
breyer.
