yeah.
unknown
speaker
mm
hmm.
unknown
speaker
then
why...
i'm
sorry.
unknown
speaker
can
you
tell
us
a
little
bit--
unknown
speaker
they
figured,
you
know,
they
traded
it
for
some
other
concessions
by
the
union
and
they
thought
this
one
was
one
they
didn't
care
that
much
about.
unknown
speaker
so
you
know,
you
can't
feel
very
sorry
for
the
company
if
that's
what
happens
to
them.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
criterion
of
violation
of
public
policy
going
to
be?
i
don't
want
to
create
a
whole
tort
law
of
drug-impaired
drivers
that
the
lower
federal
courts
are
going
to
have
to
decide
how
risky
it
was
to
put
this
driver
back
on
the
road,
how
risky
it
was
to
put
another
driver
back
on
the
road.
this
is
just
not
the
kind
of
stuff
the
federal
courts
are
intended
to
be
dealing
with.
unknown
speaker
i
want
a
clear
line.
i
don't
think
you
can
give
us
a
clear
line.
in
fact,
you
don't
even
suggest
a
clear
line.
you
say
every
case
has
to
be
decided
on
its
own
facts.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
agree
with
your
expression
of
what
the
public
policy
is,
for
one
thing.
you
say
the
public
policy
is
what?
you
said
that
people
who
drive
dangerous
vehicles
shouldn't
be
users
of
illegal
drugs.
unknown
speaker
he
wouldn't
be
violating
any
law
or
regulation,
but
he
also
wouldn't
be
asking
the
court
to
cooperate
in
his--
unknown
speaker
--in
his
insouciance.
unknown
speaker
well--
