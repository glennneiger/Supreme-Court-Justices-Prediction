david
h.
souter
well,
but
even
in
that
case,
how
would
it
affect
any
property
interest
of
the
state,
unless
you
could
show
that
the
person
who
got
the
license
somehow
intended
to
exercise
the
rights
under
it,
less
than
some
other
holder
might
have
done,
and
thereby
produce
less
revenue
from
the
state,
which
is
at
least
on
the
face
of
it
counterintuitive,
because
the
state
and
the
licensee
has
the
same
interest
in
maximizing
the
amount
of
gambling
that
goes
on,
but
save
in
that
odd
situation,
how
would
a
limited
number
of
licenses
affect
your
property
analysis?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
it
be
a
basis
for
saying
that
there
is
a
property
interest
at
all,
where
there
is
not,
as
you
argue,
under
these
circumstances?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
true
if
it
gives
away
10
licenses
or
100
licenses,
doesn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
see.
if
it's
an
infinite
number,
sure,
they
can
always
create
one
more
license,
but
i
don't
see
how
that
affects
the
property
analysis
as
opposed
to
a
regulatory
analysis.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
give
me
an
example...
maybe
the
most
obvious
example
you
can
think
of...
of
the
deprivation
of
honest
services?
i
may
not
understand
what
that
term
refers
to.
justice
david
h.
souter
basically
any
kind
of
corruption
on
the
part
of
the
employee.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
has
that
property
interest
been
infringed
in
any
way,
because
there's
no
claim,
as
i
understand
it,
and
i
don't
know
whether
your
argument
suggests
that
there
was
any
intent
here
to
deprive
the
state
of
its
licensing
fees,
and
no
intent
here
to
deprive
the
state
of
its
percentage,
and
no
intent
here,
in
effect,
to
conduct
less
gambling
than
would
otherwise
be
possible
in
order
to
minimize
revenue,
so
even
if
we
accept
your
theory
that
there
are
property
interests
that
the
state
can
claim,
how
have
any
of
them
been
infringed
on
the
allegations
of
this
complaint?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
don't
see
where
the
fraud
comes
into
it.
in
other
words,
the
only
basis
upon
which
i
can
see
any
fraud
here,
if
we
start
with
the
assumptions
that
i
made,
that
there's
no
claim
that
they
were
minimizing
business
or
skimping
on
the
percentage
or
whatnot,
the
only
basis
to
say
that
there
has
been...
that
the
state
has
been
defrauded
of
something
is
to
say
that
the
property
right
must
be
some
kind
of
metaphysical
entity
that
somehow
goes
beyond
the
right
to
receive
the
fees,
and
the
right
to
receive
the
percentage,
and
i
don't
know
why
we
should
take
that
step
and
recognize
some
kind
of
a
metaphysical
property
right
in
addition
to
these
quite
easily
defined
property
interests.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
as
i
understand
it,
then,
the...
what
i
was
sort
of
disparaging
as
the
metaphysical
right
is
basically
the
state's
regulatory
interest.
it
has
nothing
to
do
directly...
well,
strike
that.
it
is
a
right
of...
to
dispose
of
licenses
conceived
of
as
something
connected
to
but
nonetheless
distinguishable
from
the
right
to
receive
the
fee,
the
right
to
receive
the
percentage
and
so
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
we
were
to
say,
we're
going
to
distinguish
for
purposes
of
this
statute
between
the
state's
regulatory
interest
and
the
state's
property
interest,
then
you'd
have
to
lose,
wouldn't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
dreeben,
i
have,
i
guess,
a
basic
problem
with
how
we
even
get
to
your
second
theory,
because
as
i
understand
it
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
charged
the
jury
simply
on
the
theory
of
depriving
the
third
party
of
property,
so
i
don't
see
how
we
could
even
get
into
this
if
we
wanted
to.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
he
did
it
on
a
theory
of
defrauding,
i.e.,
getting
the
other
person's
property,
didn't
he?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
it's
like
lesser
included?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
because
in
this
case
or
in
any
regulatory
case,
as
distinct
from
the
case
of
private
ownership
or
private
property,
there
are
two
capacities,
i
suppose,
on
the
part
of
the
supposed
property
owner,
and
one
is
a
regulatory
capacity
and
one
is
arguably
a
proprietary
one,
and
i
suppose...
i
mean,
wouldn't
it
be
your
argument
that
the
right
to
exclude
would
have
to
be
classified
on
the
regulatory
side
rather
than
the
property
side?
so
in
other
words,
the
right
to
exclude
is
here,
but
the
reason
it
isn't
property
in
the
case
of
the
government
is
that
the
government
holds
it
in
a
different
capacity
as
regulator,
which
is
a
capacity
that
the
private
property
owner
doesn't
have.
