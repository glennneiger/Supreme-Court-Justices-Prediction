justice

bader

is
it
the
case
that
the
same
would
apply
to
a
federal
agency?
this
is
not...
the
statute
is
not
peculiarly
directed
at
state
agencies.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
any
case
it
would
be...
any
application
for
a
permit
to
a
federal
authority
would
be
susceptible
to
the
same
argument.
there's
no
distinction
that's
being
made,
a
federal
power
against
the
state
as
against
the
federal
government.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
in
the
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
years
since
mcnally?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
we
can
assume
that
someone
in
congress
knew
of
this
court's
interpretation
and
could
have
done
something
about
it
if
it
disagreed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
there
other
licenses,
state
licenses
where
the
government's
revenue
is
a
percentage
of
the
proceeds
of
the
business,
as
distinguished
from
the
tax
on
the
income?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
how
does
that
differ
from
giving
out
liquor
licenses,
or
giving
out
taxi
medallions?
my
question
is,
how
far
this
theory
of
yours
spreads,
and
as
i
read
it
in
your
brief
it
seems
very
far.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
tell
me,
what
is
the
government's
position?
what
falls,
what
licenses
would
fall
under
the
government's
theory,
and
which
ones
would
be
left
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
suppose
there
is,
like
with
the
example
of
the
hotel
and
the
occupancy
tax
that
mr.
mogin
raised,
or
people
who
run
liquor
establishments
get
a
much
higher
tax
than
people
who
are
in
other
businesses.
that's
special
to
that
business.
do
those
qualify?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
said
you
were
going
to
treat
the
government
just
as
a
private
person
would
be
treated
under
this
statute
that
was...
but
are
you
saying
that's
true
of
the
theory
that
it's
property
in
the
hands
of
the
government
as
well,
and
not
true
under
this
alternative
theory?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that
could
apply,
at
least
in
the
cases
you
excluded
from
your
first
theory.
that
is,
the
license
to
practice
law,
the
license
to
practice
medicine,
those
are
very
valuable
in
the
hands
of
the
recipient.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
think
sometimes
when
they
divide
property
on
termination
of
marriage
those
are
attributed
a
monetary
value.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
my
problem
with
your
large
interpretation,
mr.
dreeben,
is
you're
essentially
making
the
federal
government
monitors
of
what
would
be
a
false
statement
to
a
government
agency.
18
u.s.c.
1001,
that
operates
on
the
federal
level.
you're
just
saying,
well,
we
do
the
same
thing
with
overall
monitoring,
of
making
a
false
statement
to
a
government
official,
state
or
federal,
and
that's
the
kind
of
thing,
if
congress
meant
to
do,
shouldn't
it
be
required
to
speak
clearly?
shouldn't
a
clear
statement
rule
apply
to
that
level
of
monitoring,
false
statements
made
to
state
agencies?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
it's
only
the
jurisdictional
peg,
i
guess
the
wire...
isn't
there...
there
are
parallel
statute
that
deals
with
use
of
wire
communications?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
seems
to
me
there's
hardly
any
application
for
anything
that
wouldn't
use
one
or
the
other,
a
telephone
or
the
mail.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
your
alternate
theory
is
admittedly
very
broad.
you
gave
a
yes
answer
to
the
employment
application.
is
there
any
guidelines
that
are
given
to
federal
prosecutors,
given
the
tremendous
potential
sweep
of
the
statute
as
you
construe
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
individual
prosecutor
can
decide
if
he
or
she
would
like
to
go
after
the
would
be
employee
who
lied
on
an
application
for
state
employment?

about
federal
mail
fraud
and
louisiana
licenses
to
operate
video
poker
machines.
louisiana
permits
private
operators
to
run
video
poker
devices
upon
demonstration
of
the
applicant’s
good
character
and
fiscal
integrity,
conditions
on
the
payment
of
fees
and
apportion
of
net
revenues
to
the
state.
in
1992,
carl
cleveland
a
lawyer
helped
his
client
fred
goodson
prepare
a
video
poker
license
application
for
a
partnerships
called
truck
stop
gaming.
the
application
identified
goodson’s
children
as
the
sole
owners
of
the
partnership.
louisiana
issued
the
license
and
truck
stop
gaming
renewed
it
in
1993,
1994
and
1995.
in
1996,
cleveland
and
goodson
were
charged
with
money
laundering,
racketeering
and
conspiracy
in
connection
with
the
scheme
to
bribe
state
legislators
to
caste
votes
favorable
to
the
video
poker
industry.
the
acts
underline
these
charges
included
four
alleged
violations
of
the
federal
mail
fraud
statute,
the
statute
that
makes
it
a
crime
to
use
the
mails
to
further,
“any
scheme
to
defraud,
or
for
obtaining
money,
or
property
by
means
of
fraudulent
representations”.
indictment
charged
that
cleveland
and
goodson
had
concealed
their
true
ownership
of
truck
stop
gaming
because
their
tax
and
financial
problems
could
have
disqualified
them
from
receiving
a
license.
a
jury
found
cleveland
guilty
of
mail
fraud
and
the
related
offenses.
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
the
conviction
recognizing
that
the
mail
fraud
statute
targets
depravation
of
money
and
property,
and
holding
that
video
poker
licenses
qualify
as
property
in
the
hands
of
the
state.
we
reverse
that
determination.
the
licensing
statute
leaves
no
doubt
that
the
state’s
core
concern
is
regulatory,
it
permits
private
actors
to
pursue
activities
they
may
not
pursue
without
official
authorization.
thus,
the
licensing
scheme
also
generate
property
held
by
the
state
within
the
mail
fraud
statutes
compass,
we
think
not.
the
government
emphasizes
that
the
state
collects
a
fee
for
each
license
and
receives
substantial
payment
from
each
licensee
while
the
license
is
in
affect.
but
louisiana
does
not
receive
the
lion’s
share
of
its
expected
revenue,
while
the
licenses
are
in
its
own
hands;
it
receives
ongoing
revenue
only
after
permits
have
been
issue
to
licensees.
licenses'
pre-issuance
merely
entitle
the
state
to
collect
a
processing
fee
from
applicants.
were
this
sufficient
to
establish
a
property
right,
then
states
would
have
property
rights
in
drivers’
licenses,
medical
licenses,
and
other
licenses
that
the
government
concedes
are
purely
regulatory.
tellingly,
the
government
does
not
allege
that
cleveland
deprived
louisiana
of
any
money
to
which
it
was
entitled
by
law,
in
fact
truck
stop
gaming
paid
the
state
its
proper
share
of
revenue
over
$1.2
between
1993
and
1995.
the
government
also
contends
that
cleveland
deprived
the
state
of
its
right
to
control
the
issuance,
renewal,
and
revocation
of
video
poker
licenses.
it
compares
this
right
to
a
patent
holder’s
right
to
license
a
patent
and
to
a
franchisor's
right
to
select
its
franchisees.
but
unlike
a
patent
holder
or
franchisor,
louisiana
does
not
sell
licenses
as
a
commercial
commodity,
it
cannot
sell
its
licensing
authority
and
it
does
not
hold
licenses
in
order
to
run
video
poker
machines
itself,
the
licensing
scheme
in
short
is
in
design
an
operation
a
paradigmatic
police
power
exercise.
an
alternative
argument
the
government
presents.
read
the
mail
fraud
statute
to
define
two
discreet
offenses:
one,
schemes
to
defraud
and
two,
schemes
for
obtaining
money
or
property
by
fraud.
because
a
video
poker
license
is
property
to
the
licensee
the
government
argues,
cleveland
obtain
property
and
thereby
he
committed
mail
fraud.
but
in
mcnally
against
united
states,
a
1987
decision,
we
refused
to
read
the
statute
to
define
two
discreet
offenses.
adhering
to
mcnally
we
reaffirm
that
the
object
of
the
fraud
must
be
property
in
the
hands
of
the
victim.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
