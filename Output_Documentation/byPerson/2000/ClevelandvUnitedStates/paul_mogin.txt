mr.
paul
mogin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
for
purposes
of
the
federal
mail
fraud
statute
a
state
or
municipality
parts
with
property
when
it
issues
a
license.
in
this
case,
the
fifth
circuit
has
used
a
novel
concept
of
property
to
give
the
federal
government
the
power
to
police
state
and
local
license
applications
under
the
mail
fraud
statute
when
state
and
local
governments
are
fully
capable
of
administering
and
implementing
their
own
licensing
schemes
and
punishing
misconduct
involving
licensing
schemes
when
it
occurs.
mr.
paul
mogin
well
in
this
case,
for
example,
there's
a
false
statement
provision
in
the
louisiana
video
poker
statute.
mr.
paul
mogin
i
think
it
is,
that
there
be
a...
that
false
statements
are
ordinarily
punished...
punishable
by
criminal
provisions.
i
can't
say
that
we've
undertaken
a
survey
of
that.
in
addition,
in
the
area
of
gambling,
justice
scalia,
18
u.s.c.
1955
is
available
for
conducting
an
illegal
gambling
enterprise
and,
in
fact,
that
was
one
of
the
charges
here.
petitioner
was
acquitted
on
it,
and
the
very
theory
was
that
the
gambling
operation
was
illegal
because
of
alleged
false
statements
in
the
license
applications,
so...
and
that
had
also
been
the
charge
in
the
salvatore
case,
so
that
would
be--
mr.
paul
mogin
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
most
of
our
argument
would
apply
if
this
was
a
federal
agency,
although
in
this
case
we
have
the
united
states
v.
bass
and
the
principle
about
not
lightly
interpreting
statutes
to
reach--
mr.
paul
mogin
--under
the
fifth
circuit's
analysis
i
think
it
would
be
possible
that
a
federal
license
application
perhaps
could
be
prosecuted
if
it
met
the
fifth
circuit's
test,
which
is
somewhat
difficult
to
discern
from
the
opinion,
but
there's
nothing
in
what
the
fifth
circuit
says
that
would
confine
it
to
a
state
application,
if
that
answers
your
question.
mr.
paul
mogin
right.
mr.
paul
mogin
justice
o'connor,
there
is
no
question
the
state
is
taking
a
substantial
share
of
the
revenue
from
video
poker
operations
in
louisiana,
but
we
don't
see
how
that
gives
rise
to
any
property
interest.
certainly,
under
the
analysis
in
college
savings
bank,
cited
by
this
court
in
1999,
the
fact
that
there's
a
pecuniary
interest
involved
would
not
establish
a
property
right.
mr.
paul
mogin
no,
justice
o'connor,
we
would
say
it
is
not.
to
the
contrary,
the
state
views
video
poker
operations
as
a
source
of
revenue
for
the
state,
and
it
has
been
a
very
significant
source
of
revenue
for
the
state.
there
was
no
allegation
in
this
case
that
anything
was
not
paid
that
shouldn't
have
been
paid
in
terms
of
the
state's
pro
rata
share
and,
really,
the
states
here--
mr.
paul
mogin
--no,
i
don't
believe
that
that
argument
has
been
made
by
the
government
and,
of
course,
there's
no
question
that
the
regulatory
scheme
is
designed
to
ensure
the
honesty
and
suitability
of
licensees.
that
argument
was
not
made,
that
i
recall.
i
mean,
there's
been
no
question
that
the
licensing
process
serves
a
legitimate
purpose
to
identify
appropriate
licensees,
but
it's
hard
to
see
how
that
would
be
a
property--
mr.
paul
mogin
--no,
they're
not,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
paul
mogin
well,
it's
our
position
that
even
if
there
were
a
limitation
to
some
large
number
of
licenses,
that
the
same
analysis
would
apply,
but
certainly
that
would
be
a
factor
to
consider,
and
when
you
get
to
a
very
limited
number
of
licenses,
you
may
have
a
different
analysis,
because
then
there's...
people
are
actually
competing
with
each
other
for
a
license,
and
something
important
is
being
given
away
by
the
state.
mr.
paul
mogin
well,
i
think
that
you're
right,
the
mere
fact
that
there's
a
limitation
on
the
number
would
not,
in
our
view,
give
rise
to
a
property
deprivation.
it's
one
factor
to
consider,
and--
mr.
paul
mogin
--well,
we
think
the
term
license
is
used
in
many
different
contexts,
radio
licenses,
whatnot.
there
may
be
situations
in
which
the
state
is
giving
away
only
one
or
5
or
10
licenses,
and
our
analysis
doesn't
foreclose
what
would
happen
in
such
a
case,
but
here
there's
a
mere
grant
of
government
permission.
there's
nothing
in
what
the
government
is
doing
that
can
be
analogized
to
giving
away
an
easement.
the
applicants
are
not
competing
with
each
other,
so
i
simply--
mr.
paul
mogin
--that
is
our
position,
justice
scalia.
the
one...
the
difference
is,
if
there
were
only
one
license,
then
the
state
really
would
be
losing
something
in
giving
away
the
license.
we
still
would
not
think
that
that's
a
property
right,
but
there's
certainly
no
clear
definition
in
the
cases
of
what
property
is.
mr.
paul
mogin
well,
if...
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
were
only
one
license
available,
and
if
it
were
understood
that
once
given
it
couldn't
be
taken
back,
then
perhaps
it
could
be
said
that
the
state
was
losing
something
because
by
giving
the
license
it
lost
the
ability
to
give
it
to
anyone
else.
mr.
paul
mogin
well,
in
this
scheme,
if
10
licenses
are
given
out
for
video
poker--
mr.
paul
mogin
--and
we
don't
disagree.
the
additional
point
we'd
make
is
that
there's
no
reason
to
stretch
the
concept
of
property,
as
the
fifth
circuit
did
in
this
case.
state
licensing
schemes,
of
course,
are
designed,
drafted,
implemented
by
state
and
local
officials.
those
are
the
officials
that
are
in
the
best
position
to
interpret
them,
to
decide
whether
they've
been
violated
in
a
particular
case.
this
case,
in
fact,
arose
during
the
early
years
of
the
louisiana
video
poker
scheme,
and
state
and
local
officials
can
decide
the
appropriate
sanction,
if
there
is
misconduct.
now,
the
government
argues
that
this
license
is
special
because
the
state
has
a
substantial
economic
stake
in
the...
in
video
poker
operations.
we
would
respond,
since
when
has
the
existence
of
a
property
right
depended
on
something
as
amorphous
as
whether
there's
a
substantial
economic
stake,
or
the
reach
of
a
criminal
statute?
that's
not
an
appropriate
test
for
defining
criminal
liability.
there
would
be
a
whole
host
of
questions
that
would
be
raised
under
the
government's
theory.
how
much
is
substantial?
is
it
a
dollar
amount
that
counts?
should
it
be
the
percentage?
does
it
matter
what
other
revenues
the
licensing
authority
has,
so
that
it
might
have
a
different
situation
if
the
license
was
issued
by
a
poor
rural
county
as
opposed
to
a
wealthy,
suburban
county.
mr.
paul
mogin
justice
stevens,
we
have
a
number
of
responses
to
that.
passing
over
the
procedural
point
which
is
made
in
our
brief,
that
is
not
before
the
court,
because
it
wasn't
raised
until
the
brief
on
the
merits.
mr.
paul
mogin
right.
we've
argued
in
our
brief
that
under
the
tuttle
decision
and
other
decisions
this
court
has
only
rarely
considered
issues
raised
by
the
respondent
for
the
first
time
in
the
brief
on
the
merits,
but
on
the
merits
of
the
point,
the
court
was
unanimous
in
mcnally
that
the
1909
amendment
merely
codified
durland,
and
mcnally
held
that
the
statute
is
limited
in
scope
to
the
protection
of
property
rights,
and
that
when
the
government
is
the
alleged
victim,
and
i
quote,
any
benefit
which
the
government
derives
from
the
statute
must
be
limited
to
the
government's
interest
as
property
holder.
so
that
was
then
reaffirmed...
the
basic
holding
was
reaffirmed
in
carpenter,
and
i
think
it
was
a
premise
of
neder,
the
neder
decision
in
1999
as
well,
as
we've
explained
in
our
brief,
and
we've
also
covered
the
background
of
the
1909
amendment
in
our
brief,
the
commission
report,
which
there's
really
no
suggestion
that
congress
was
attempting
to
create
a
new
basis
of
liability.
mr.
paul
mogin
13
years.
that
was
decided
in
1987.
mr.
paul
mogin
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg,
and
in
fact
in
1988
the
statute
was
amended
to
deal
with
honest
services
cases,
which
had
been
thought
to
be
the
most
important
application
of
intangible
rights
doctrine,
and
those
were
brought
under
the
statute
if
there
was
a
deprivation
of
honest
services.
even
today,
just
acquiring
someone's
services
is
not
enough.
you
have
to
have
a
scheme
to
deprive
another
of
honest
services,
but
congress
in
1988
did
not
otherwise
change
the
mcnally
ruling,
even
though
it
was
fully
aware
of
it.
mr.
paul
mogin
justice
souter,
that
refers
to
the
principle
that
an
employer
has
a
right
to
expect
that
an
employee
will
provide
honest
services,
and
so--
mr.
paul
mogin
--a
scheme
involving
kickbacks,
for
example,
where
the
employee
is
paid
a
kickback
to
divert
business.
mr.
paul
mogin
yes.
mr.
paul
mogin
the
theory
that
the
government
has
presented
of
substantial
economic
stake,
if
adopted,
would
raise
all
kinds
of
thorny
applications,
thorny
questions
in
application,
which
would
be
particularly
troublesome,
because
it's
a
criminal
statute,
so
the
trial
judges
would
be
required
to
explain
the
standard
to
the
jury
so
the
jury
could
apply
it
in
a
particular
case,
and
that
makes
the
situation
particularly
intolerable.
the
state's
expectation
of
receiving
revenue
simply
does
not
mean
that
when
the
state
issues
a
license
it
parts
with
property.
to
go
back
to
the
college
savings
bank
case,
i
think
that
makes
it
clear
that
even
business
in
the
sense
of...
the
court
said
business
in
the
sense
of
the
activity
of
doing
business
and
making
a
profit
is
not
property,
so
the
state's
mere
expectation
of
obtaining
revenue
after
a
license
is
issued.
mr.
paul
mogin
well,
yes,
in
the
area
of
hotels,
of
course,
rooms
are
taxed
generally
based
on
occupancy,
so
that
in
new
york
city,
for
example,
the
city
would
obtain
very
substantial
revenue
from
the
occupancy
tax.
formerly
it
was
over
20
percent.
in
the
mid
nineties
it
was
reduced
to
about
15
percent.
now,
that's
called
a
tax.
mr.
paul
mogin
that's
common,
and
taxes
can
be
quite
substantial,
and
the
governments
raise
money,
of
course,
through
fees
and
charges
of
all
sorts,
not
merely
assessments
that
are
called
taxes,
so
the
fact
that
the
state
is
getting
significant
revenue
here...
i
don't
know
why
that
indicates
that
it's
losing
property
when
it
issues
the
license.
mr.
paul
mogin
well,
there
were
limited
instances,
and
there
was
case
called
united
states
v.
green,
brought
in
california,
a
prosecution
involving
obtaining
a
driver's
license,
and
the
state
prosecuted
that
under
the
intangible
rights
theory.
that's
really
the
only
clear
case
that
i'm
aware
of.
there
are
a
couple
of
cases
involving
licenses,
and
because
the
intangible
rights
theory
had
been
widely
accepted
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
that
was
the
doctrine
that
was
generally
relied
on
when
a
license
was
involved.
so
it's
our
submission--
mr.
paul
mogin
--well,
the
courts
of
appeals
at
least
i
think
have
been
in
agreement
that
the
mere
cost
of
printing
the
paper
for
the
license
is
to
de
minimis
to
support
a
charge,
and
so
the
analysis
has
focused
on
whether
some
other...
on
some
other
basis
it
can
be
said
that
the
state
is
losing
property.
we
think
the
government's
theory
of
liability
in
this
case
is
contrary
to
traditional
law,
is
not
supported
by
any
established
concept
of
property,
and
of
course
the
government
is
doing
this
in
a
criminal
case.
civil
rico
plaintiffs,
of
course,
could
take
advantage
of
the
theory
if
it
were
endorsed
by
the
court,
and
the
very
novelty
of
the
theory
makes
an
inadequate
basis
for
injecting
federal
law
into
the
area
of
state
laws,
local
licensing,
so
for
that
reason
we
submit
the
petitioner's
conviction
should
be
reversed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
mogin
mr.
chief
justice,
we
will
waive
rebuttal
unless
there
are
questions.
mr.
paul
mogin
the
key
distinction
is
that
there
this
court
was
able
to
find
prior
law
that
recognized
confidential
business
information
as
property.
the
ruckelshaus
case
in
this
court,
a
case
from...
the
international
news
case
i
believe
it
is,
a
treatise
was
cited
in
the
opinion.
there
was
substantial
prior
law
indicating
that
confidential
business
information
was
protected
as
property
under
the
civil
law,
so
the
court
was
not
required
to
announce
a
new
theory
of
property
in
that
case.
mr.
paul
mogin
well,
this
court
has
pointed
out
that
there's
no
precise
or
universal
definition
of
property.
that's
been
said
in
some
bankruptcy
cases,
and--
mr.
paul
mogin
--yes,
but
i
don't
think
that
from
that
one
could
conclude
that
every
right
to
exclude
is
a
property
right,
because
here
you
have
the
breadth
of
it,
that
the
licensing
and
approvals
and
permits
and
certifications
and
registrations
that
the
government
issues
is
truly
extraordinary.
it's
never
been
thought
that
those
are
property
rights
that
the
government
is
exercising,
and
property
law
has
been
formed...
is
based
a
lot
on
history
and
tradition,
and
not
merely
on
characteristics.
there's
no
one
characteristic,
such
as
the
right
to
exclude,
that
can
be
focused
on
and
is
the
be
all
and
end
all
of
whether
there's
a
property
right.
mr.
paul
mogin
i
think
that's
exactly
right,
and
that's
why
the
government
prohibits
all
types
of
things,
excludes
people
from
all
types
of
activities.
the
mere
fact
that
the
government
is
excluding
something
does
not
mean
it's
exercising
a
property
right.
one
has
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
decision
and
see
whether
the
government
is
acting
in
a
regulatory
or
proprietary
capacity.
as
we
cite
in
our
briefs,
the
courts
have
always
viewed
licensing
decisions
and
revocation
decisions
as
regulatory
rather
than
proprietary.
