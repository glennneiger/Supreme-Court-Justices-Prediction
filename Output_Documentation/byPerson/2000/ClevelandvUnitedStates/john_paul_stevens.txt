mr.
mogin,
what
do
you
do
with
the
government's
argument
that
under
the
second
clause
of
the
statute
you
don't
need
a
victim?
they
obtain
money
pursuant
to
a
scheme
to
defraud,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
justice
john
paul
stevens
an
alternative
basis
to
affirm.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mogin,
i
can
probably
find
this
out
myself,
but
on
this
issue,
had
this
issue
arisen
before
mcnally
was
decided?
i
know
there
were
a
bunch
of
post
mcnally
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dreeben...
if
you
answered
the
question...
it
seems
to
me
that
you
really...
the
property
right
that
i
would
think
of
in
terms
of
normal
usage
would
be
the
right
to
exclude
as
one
of
the
bundle
of
rights,
but
you
don't
claim
the
right
to
exclude
is
sufficient,
because
you
would
not
include
the
bar,
the
control
of
the
membership
in
the
bar,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
not
claiming...
every
right
to
exclude
is
not
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
then
i
don't...
i
really
don't
understand
why
it
makes
any
difference
that
the
state
shares
in
the
revenues.
i
don't
see
why
it
would
be
a
different
case
if
they
didn't,
they
just
taxed
the
video
people
on
some
income
basis,
rather
than
sharing
in
the
revenues.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
even
if
it's
acting
in
a
proprietary
way,
it's
not
deprived
of
any
revenue.
it's
not
deprived
of
anything,
except
the
right
to
exclude
these
people,
and
that's
not
itself
sufficient.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which--
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
your
theory
apply,
assuming
there's
a
mailing,
of
course,
to
false
statements
in
an
employment
application?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
you
want
to
get
a
state
job,
and
you
lie
about
your
background
in
some
way,
misstate
your
age,
or
you
say
you
were
never
caught
speeding
or
something
like
that.
would
it
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this,
mr.
mogin.
the
right
to
exclude
is
mentioned
over
and
over
again
in
property
cases
as
one
of
the
bundles
of
rights
that's
a
property
right,
and
so
forth.
i
know
the
government
doesn't
press
this
to
the
extreme
it
would
go,
but
why
isn't...
why
couldn't
one
view
the
video
poker
industry
as
an
industry
that
is
controlled
by
the
state
and
they
have
the
right
to
exclude
newcomers,
oldcomers,
and
that's
just
an
old
fashioned
property
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
true
that
the
right
to
exclude
is
referred
to
in
many,
many
property
cases
as
a
strand
of
property
right?
