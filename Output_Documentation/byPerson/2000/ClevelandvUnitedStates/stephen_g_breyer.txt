justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
don't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
does,
under
louisiana
law,
under
the
statutes
of
louisiana,
can
the
state
of
louisiana
give
itself
a
license
and
go
into
the
video
poker
business?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
under
louisiana
law,
could
the
state
of
louisiana
sell
to
mr.
joe
smith,
a
private
citizen,
the
right
to
give
out
franchises
to
others?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
don't
think
so,
either.
therefore,
it
doesn't
sound
like
mcdonald's
at
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
mcdonald's
can
give
the
right
to
sell
to
others.
mcdonald's
has
something
that's
valuable
because
it
could
go
into
business
itself.
it
can
do
what
it
wants.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
mean,
that's
your
analogy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
of
course,
under
the
constitution
it
could,
of
the
united
states,
but
the
question
is,
what
is
the
scheme
that
louisiana
has
set
up
under
positive
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
under
positive
law,
i'm
just
saying
in
the
two
respects
i
mentioned
it
does
not
sound
like
mcdonald's.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
not.
it
could
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
could
under
the
constitution.
it
couldn't
under
the
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
we
did
have
that,
if
that
theory's
in
front
of
us,
it
seemed
a
little
broad.
it
seemed
that
it
would
make
guilty
of
mail
fraud...
i
was
thinking,
you
know,
richard,
on
the
survivors
program--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
know
that.
but
i
mean,
he
seemed
absolutely
guilty
under
your
interpretation--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
then
i
thought
that
probably...
probably
any
competitor,
by
the
way,
in
a
commercial
context,
anybody
who
lies
to
his
competitor,
any
boss
who
lies
to
his
subordinate,
any
subordinate
who
lies
to
his
boss
or
a
coworker,
they're
all
out
to
get
money,
and
they're
telling
lies
or
scheming
to
get
money,
just
like
richard
on
the
survivors
program,
and
i
was
a
little
surprised
that
the
government
is
suddenly
going
to
make
criminal
under
the
mail
fraud
statute...
i
mean,
bring
back
cotton
mather.
i
mean,
this
is...
any
lying
in
a
commercial
context
where
you're
trying
to
get
money
out
of
it
is
now
mail
fraud.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
hope
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
i'm
most
worried
about
in
that,
of
course,
is
that
it
is
possible,
you
know,
that
competitors
in
a
commercial
context
may
tell
each
other
lies
sometime.
i'm
going
to
the
trade
show,
and
then
when
your
competitor
goes
you
stay
home
and
take
his
customer
away.
well,
each
one
of
those
is
a
rico
suit,
and
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
material.
you
get
your
competitor
to
go
to
the
trade
show
and
then
while
he's
away
you
take
his
customer.
there
was
quite
a
lot
of
money
there.
