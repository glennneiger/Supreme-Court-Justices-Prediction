mr.
mogin,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
if
we
focused
somewhat
on
the
statutory
language
in
this
case
to
figure
out
what
it
covers,
and
we
have
to
read
it,
i
suppose,
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
mcnally,
which
does
appear
to
suggest
that
it...
the
statute
covers
only
the
scheme
to
defraud
the
victim
of
money
or
property,
although
the
statute
doesn't
say
so
in
so
many
words.
now,
let
me
ask
you
this.
here,
i
take
it
the
state
did
more
than
just
issue
a
license.
it
issued
a
license
with
an
ongoing
substantial
revenue
component
for
the
state.
it
wasn't
just
a
one
time
payment
of
a
license
fee
and
then
you
have
this
forever.
it
contemplates,
does
it
not,
the
payment
of
substantial
amounts
of
money
to
the
state
thereafter,
and
does
that
distinguish
it,
or
make
it
somehow
more
of
a
property
interest
than
otherwise
might
be
the
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
taking
money
from
the
victim
is
covered,
according
to
mcnally,
so
is
it
taking
money
from
the
state,
in
a
sense,
because
of
this
revenues--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
dreeben,
you
seem
to
be...
the
government's
position
seems
to
be
somewhat
of
a
shifting
target.
you
appear
to
be
arguing
today
that
the
state
itself
is
deprived
of
property
under
this
scheme,
and
when
it's
a
proprietary
licensing
scheme
that
is
the
situation.
i
thought
in
your
brief
the
focus
was
an
argument
to
the
effect
that
the
statute
is
satisfied
so
long
as
the
licensee
gets
some
kind
of
money
or
property.
it
doesn't
matter
if
the
victim,
here
the
state,
is
deprived
of
property.
are
you
abandoning
that
argument
now?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
was
new.
i
don't
think
it
was
pressed
below.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
do
you
still
adhere
to
that
as
well?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
any
reason
why
we
should
address
it,
since
it
came
so
late
in
the
day?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
by
implication
mcnally
seemed
to
assume
that
it
was...
the
statute
covers
only
money
or
property
obtained
from
the
victim.
i
mean,
that's
how
the
opinion
seems
to
be
focused,
anyway.
