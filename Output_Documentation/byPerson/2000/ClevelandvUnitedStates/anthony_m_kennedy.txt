justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--did
the
state
ever
argue
that
it
has
an
interest
in
assuring
the
users
of
these
machines
that
the
operators
are
honest
and
that
by
this
alleged
misstatement
the
goodwill,
the
confidence
that
the
state
has
in
its
own
licenses
is
somehow
diminished,
and
that
that's
a
taking
of
property,
and
of
course
you
might
say
this
is
intangible
property,
but
did
they
ever
make
that
sort
of
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
the
licenses
limited
in
number?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
that
have
made
a
difference?
it
would
be
like
a
taxi
cab
medallion
in
new
york
or
something?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
were
there
money
damages
in
carpenter
to
the
wall
street
journal?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
do
you
distinguish
the
carpenter
case,
because
the
carpenter
case
held
that
the
confidential
information
of
the
wall
street
journal
was
traditionally
protected
as
property
because
it
would
be
subject
to
protection
in
equity,
et
cetera.
