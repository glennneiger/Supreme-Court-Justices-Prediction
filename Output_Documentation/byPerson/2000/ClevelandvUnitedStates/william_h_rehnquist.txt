chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
99-804,
carl
w.
cleveland
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
mogin.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--how
does
the
state
lose
something
giving
away
one
license,
but
not
lose
something
giving
away
a
number
of
licenses?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
some
states
administer
their
sales
tax
by
issuing
licenses
to
do
business,
don't
they,
and
all
it
means
is
that
you
have
to
pay
a
sales
tax
on
your
gross
receipts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
an
automobile
license,
a
vehicle
license?
supposing
there's
a
fraudulent
application
for
a
vehicle
license
and
the
government
says,
well,
we
did
part
with
property,
it
cost
us
76
cents
to
make
that
license,
although
they
get
300
for
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
mogin.
mr.
dreeben,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
state
lose
any
revenue
here
because
of
the
fraud?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
why
isn't
justice
souter's
question
correct,
that
you're
not
talking
about
any
orthodox
property
interest
here
that
was
lost
to
the
state.
you're
talking
about
a
loss
of
its
regulatory
authority.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
a
private
action
you
have
to
show
money
damages.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
know.
that's
why
i
think
your
analogy
is
quite
imperfect.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
one
argument
in
favor
of
exercising
our
discretion
here
is
that
we
took
the
case
to
construe
the
meaning
of
a
statute,
there's
a
conflict
in
the
circuits,
and
to
say,
you
know,
we're
construing
it
this
way
but
there's
another
argument
that
we
might
accede
to
in
some
other
case
wouldn't
be
the
best
use
of
our
resources.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
know
whether
one...
18
u.s.c.
1001
was
passed
before
or
after
the
mail
fraud
statute,
but
the
government,
intimated
by
justice
ginsburg,
really
doesn't
need
1001
if
you're
right
about
the
mail
fraud
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can
you
give
me
perhaps
one
of
those?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
basically
the
mail
fraud
is
much
broader
than
1001.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
what
way
is
it
narrower?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
think
the
people
of
louisiana
deserve
the
kind
of
government
that
they
elect.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
mogin,
you
have
11
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mogin.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
cleveland
against
untied
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
