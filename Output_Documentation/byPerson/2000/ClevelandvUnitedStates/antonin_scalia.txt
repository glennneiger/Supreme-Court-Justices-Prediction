what
would
they
be
punished
under?
what
kind
of
state
laws
would
cover--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that's
fairly
standard
in
state
licensing
schemes?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
be
true
if
there
were
just
one
license
being
given
away,
if
there
were
only
one
gambling
casino
allowed
in
the
whole
state.
i
mean,
you
know,
do
you
stand
by
your
analysis
or
not?
it
seems
to
me
if
you
stand
by
your
analysis
you
have
to
say...
it
would
be
a
more
appealing
case,
i
suppose,
if
there
were
only
one
license,
but
on
the
analysis
that
you've
brought
us,
even
if
there's
only
one
license,
there's
no
property
involved,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say
that's
what
we
did
in
mcnally.
you
said
this
argument
was
available
there
and
we
chose
not
to
address
it,
and
to
leave
everything
sort
of
up
in
the
air.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
was
here
in
mcnally.
i
didn't
realize
we
had
done
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
you're
saying
we
did
in
mcnally
what
you
are
now
arguing
it
would
be
irresponsible
for
us
to
do
now.
i
don't
think
we
did
that
in
mcnally.
i
thought
we
had
addressed
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
contrary
to
your
interpretation
of
what
the
amendment
did.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
it
did
more
than
that,
we
should
have
said
that
in
mcnally.
we
shouldn't
have
said,
it
just
did
this,
which
would
have
reached
the
result
that
we
reached
in
mcnally,
and
simply
ignored
the
fact
that
it
did
more
than
that,
which
would
have
produced
a
different
result
in
mcnally.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
also
would
never
reach
the
principal
holding
of
mcnally
if
you're
going
to
put
all
of
the
weight
on
that
footnote.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
i
don't
think
footnote...
what
note
was
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
--9,
i
don't
think
footnote
9
was
meant
to
preclude
the
question
that's
before
us
here,
any
more
than
it
was
meant
to
preclude
the
question
of
whether
intangible
services
can
qualify
under
the
statute.
certainly
everybody
assumed
that's
what
the
case
decided,
despite
footnote
9.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
now,
wait.
it
was
a
later
congress
that
decided
that's
what
they
wanted
to
do.
that
doesn't
have
anything
to
say
about
what
the
earlier
congress
intended
when
they
passed
this
fraud
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
these
were
different
people
in
congress,
after
mcnally,
and
they
decided
that
they
agreed
with
the
government
that
there
should
be
a
way
to
get
these
people,
but
that
says
nothing
at
all
about
whether
the
statute,
as
originally
drafted
by
another
congress
many
years
ago,
all
of
whom
are
gone,
meant
what
we
said
it
meant
in
mcnally.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
a
misstatement
in
a
tax
return,
state
filed
tax
return?
justice
antonin
scalia
greater
deduction,
or
lesser
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
scheme
to
keep
your
own
property,
which
you're
supposed
to
give
to
the
state.
i'm
not
sure
that
anything
is
being
taken
from
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
read
the
statute
too
closely,
do
you?
