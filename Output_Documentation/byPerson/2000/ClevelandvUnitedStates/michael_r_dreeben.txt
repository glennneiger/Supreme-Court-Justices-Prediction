mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
a
video
poker
license
is
property
both
in
the
hands
of
the
state
and
in
the
hands
of
the
licensee.
petitioner's
scheme
therefore
violates
both
the
first
and
the
second
clauses
of
the
mail
fraud
statute.
i'll
address
first
why
a
video
poker
license
is
property
in
the
hands
of
the
state.
a
video
poker
license
represents
the
state's
right
to
a
stream
of
payments
from
an
enormously
lucrative
business,
a
business
that
the
state
has
absolute
power
to
conduct
itself.
instead
of
conducting
the
business
itself,
the
state
franchises
that
opportunity
to
private
individuals
while
asserting
control
over
every
aspect
of
the
business
and
retaining
a
right
to
a
large
share
of
the
revenues.
by--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
souter,
i
would
agree
that
if
there
were
a
direct
fraud
at
money
or
property
of
the
state
in
a
tangible
form
or
in
a
financial
form,
that
would
be
an
easier
case
than
this
one.
this
case,
i
suggest
the
best
way
to
look
at
it
is
to
start
from
the
premise
that
the
state
is
to
be
treated
as
any
property
owner
under
the
mail
fraud
statute.
it
is
to
be
no
less
and
no
more
protected
than
a
private
individual
similarly
situated,
and
to
understand
how
the
state
loses
property,
you
have
to
compare
the
state
to
a
similarly
situated
private
individual.
now,
the
two
analogies
that
most
readily
show
how
the
state
loses
an
intangible
property
right
are
a
private
franchise
business,
which
has
the
right
to
exercise
franchises
and
grant
franchises
to
private
parties,
and
has
a
contract
right
not
to
be
defrauded
in
choosing
the
franchisees
that
it
chooses.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it's
not
a
metaphysical
property
right.
it
is
an
intangible
property
right,
and
under
this
court's
decision
in
carpenter
v.
united
states,
intangible
property
rights
are
just
as
protected
as
tangible
ones.
now,
the
way
that
an
intangible
property
right
is
identified
is
by
looking
at
the
legal
scheme
that
creates
those
rights,
and
louisiana
created
a
legal
scheme
under
which
it
has
the
exclusive
right
to
determine
who
may
engage
in
the
video
poker
business.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
is
both
a
regulatory
and
a
proprietary
interest.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
because
i
would
define
the
state's
property
interest
more
broadly
than
simply
the
actual
currency
that
is
received
under
the
license.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
we
didn't
charge
or
attempt
to
prove
that
the
state
lost
revenue
and,
in
fact,
louisiana
connects
the
gambling,
the
video
poker
terminals
to
a
central
computer
to
ensure
that
skimming
of
revenues
does
not
occur.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
think
we
are
talking
about
a
property
interest
that
in
the
private
sector
would
clearly
be
recognized
as
such.
it
would
be
analogizeable
most
closely
to
a
contract
interest
of
a
party
that
runs
a
franchise
business
and
selects
its
own
franchisees,
and
if
it
is
lied
to
by
the
franchisees,
it
is
defrauded
in
its
act
of
letting
a
contract
to
that
franchise
holder.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
true,
but
under
the
mail
fraud
statute
we
do
not.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
the
analogy
is
an
analogy
which
attempts
to
compare
the
state
to
a
private
party,
and
the
difference
is
that
the
state
can
always
be
said
in
some
sense
to
be
acting
as
a
regulator.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
there
were
no
money
damages
in
the
wall
street
journal
case
at
all,
because
all
the
wall
street
journal
lost
was
its
exclusive
right
to
determine
when
to
publish
certain
columns,
and
winans
and
carpenter
were
accused
in
that
case
of
having
taken
from
the
journal
their
right,
the
journal's
right
to
decide
when
to
disclose
the
contents
of
that
column.
it
was
highly
intangible.
it's
an
interest
only
created
by
law,
and
by
direct
analogy
here
the
interest
that
is
created
is
louisiana's
interest
in
deciding
which
proprietary
parties
will
work
with
it
in
the
video
poker--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--under
the
louisiana
law,
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
under
louisiana
law--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
believe
that
the
state
has
that
authority.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it
would
be--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
state--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
state
could
choose
to
operate
in
precisely
that
manner.
the
state
could
have--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
i
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
breyer,
i
agree
with
you
that
the
state
has
not
assigned
to
itself
the
right
to
sell
video
poker
licenses.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
don't
see
any
reason--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--under
its
own
statute,
but
if
you're
looking
at
the
legal
rights
that
it
has
invested
in
itself,
it
is
as
if
louisiana
has
made
the
state
the
exclusive
holder
and
determiner
of
who
may
participate
in
the
video
poker
industry
with
a
substantial
revenue
share
being
assigned
back
to
the
state.
the
state
could
have
done
the
exact
same
thing
in
a
different
manner.
it
could
have
said,
you,
the
state,
shall
select
someone
who
will
choose
all
these
state
franchise
holders
who
will
do
the
video
poker
business
and
it
could
have
sold
that
interest,
could
have
said,
a
private
party
can
take
over
the
role
of
deciding
who
gets
a
license
and
collect
all
the
money
and
give
some
of
the
money
back
to
the
state,
but
it
did
not
do
that.
instead,
it
retained
those
legal
rights
in
itself,
and
those
legal
rights
would
have
been
viewed
as
property
had
a
private
property
holder
exercised
them.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
ginsburg,
it
spreads
only
to
those
licenses
and
those
state
activities
that
are
generically
speaking
more
in
a
proprietary
mold
than
in
a
regulatory
mold,
and
there
is
a
classification
question
that
arises.
both
liquor
licenses
and
taxi
medallions
share
some
features
with
the
louisiana
scheme
and,
therefore,
arguably
both
of
those
would
fall
on
the
property
side
of
the
equation.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
our
position
is
that
a
purely
regulatory
license,
such
as
a
license
to
practice
medicine,
or
a
driver's
license,
is
not
encompassed
within
this
theory
of
property,
but
a
license,
or
a
regulatory
proprietary
scheme
such
as
a
franchise
scheme,
or
a
license
that
is
very
closely
linked
in
the
revenue
stream
that
goes
back
to
the
state
and
in
the
regulatory
component
is.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
they
do
under
a
strict
analytical
approach,
but
i
also
think
that
there
is
a
component
to
the
analysis
that
is
narrower
than
assuming
that
all
such
licenses
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
mail
fraud
statute,
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
if
there
was
no
linkage
between
the
taxation
and
the
licensing
scheme,
then
it's
harder
to
say
that
the
state
is
acting
in
a
proprietary
than
in
a
regulatory--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it's
not
itself
sufficient,
but
in
combination
with
a
scheme
such
as
this,
that
creates
in
the
state
the
power
to
participate
in
a
particular
industry,
and
to
select,
in
effect,
the
participants
in
the
industry,
the
agents
who
will
carry
out
the
work,
the
state
has
acted
in
a
way
that
far
more
closely
resembles
a
franchise
business
than
it
does
a
pure,
sovereign
regulator,
and
that
is
the
question
that
has
to
be
asked
under
the
mail
fraud
statute.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
i
do.
it
is
our
alternative
theory
of
why--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
court
has
discretion
to
address
it.
it
certainly
isn't
required
to
address
it.
we
did
not
argue
it
below.
but
i
will
say
that
in
favor
of
the
court
addressing
it
and
resolving
it
is
that
it
is
a
purely
legal
argument
that
the
government
made
in
mcnally,
that
the
court
did
not
squarely
address
in
mcnally
for
a
variety
of--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
there
is
language
in
mcnally,
without
doubt,
that
reads
that
way,
but
that
language
could
not
have
announced
a
holding
in
mcnally,
because
the
actual
holding
of
mcnally
was,
in
addition
to
the
well
known
part
of
mcnally
that
an
intangible
right
to
good
government
is
not
a
property
right,
the
court
also
held
that
there
was
no
deception
of
the
state
and
there
were
no
false
statements
made
to
any
third
party,
so
there
was
no
factual
predicate
in
mcnally
itself
for
deciding
whether
the
second
clause
applies.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
agree,
mr.
chief
justice,
particularly--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
there
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
there
is
actually
no
discussion
in
the
opinion
itself
of
the
theory
that
the
government
raised
that
the
false
statements
alone,
when
the
defendant
obtains
property,
are
sufficient.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
as
i
said,
justice
scalia,
there...
the
square
holdings
of
mcnally
did
not
require
the
court
to
come
to
a
definitive
answer
to
it,
and
if
you
read
the
mcnally
opinion,
which
is
fairly
brief,
it
doesn't
identify
and
reject
in
terms
this
theory.
what
the
mcnally
opinion
does
do
is
point
out
that
the
second
clause
of
the
statute,
which
was
added
in
1909,
has
the
effect
of
codifying
this
court's
decision
in
durland
v.
united
states,
which
held
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--false
promises
come
within
the
mail
fraud
statute.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
it's
not
contrary
to
it.
i
think
that
the
amendment
did
more
than
that.
it
clearly
at
least
codifies
durland.
there's
no
question
about
that.
but
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
does
not
require
that
there
be
a
deprivation
of
property.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
would
not
have
produced
a
different
result
in
mcnally,
justice
scalia,
because
the
court
made
quite
clear
in
footnote
9
of
its
opinion
that
there
was
no
deception
of
the
state
at
all.
the
government's
theory
in
mcnally
was
that
state
officeholders
who
have
an
adverse
interest
to
the
state
are
required
to
disclose
it
to
the
state,
and
this
court
said
in
footnote
9
of
mcnally
that
we
should
not
assume
that
there
was
any
such
duty
of
disclosure,
and
without
a
duty
of
disclosure,
there
could
have
been
no
fraud
that
would
have
triggered
the
second
clause
of
the
statute.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
court
could
have
decided
the
case
based
on
that
analysis,
but
it
decided
it
on
a
broader
analysis,
which
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--footnote
9.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
what
i
think
is
evident
from
mcnally
is
that
the
court
at
various
points
in
the
opinion
wrote
broadly
about
the
mail
fraud
statute.
but
there
is
a
distinct
theory
of
liability
that
we
briefed
before
this
court
in
mcnally
and
that
was
not
addressed
in
terms,
and
i
think
that
there
is
an
explanation
for
why
that
theory
was
not
addressed,
which
is
that
there
were
no
false
representations
to
anybody
that
were
charged
in
the
jury
instructions
that
could
have
supported
that
theory.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
don't
want
to
speak
to
richard
in
the
survivors,
since--
[laughter]
--we
haven't
charged
that
case
and
i'm
not
familiar
with
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
as
far
as
the
breadth
of
the
theory,
it
is
a
broad
theory.
i'm
not
sure,
justice
breyer,
whether
it
covers
all
of
the
hypotheticals
in
your
question,
but
it
is
a
broader
theory
than
the
license
as
a
proprietary
activity
theory,
because
it
would
apply
whenever
an
individual
lies
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
property--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
so.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
i
think
there
is
a
materiality
component
in
the
mail
fraud
statute
that
this
court
described
in
neder
v.
united
states--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
haven't
tried
to
frame
this
as
an
application
that
would
sweep
in
routine
commercial
conduct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
ginsburg,
but
in
this
particular
case
what
the
defendant
did
was
lie
to
the
state,
concealing
adverse
facts
about
his
background
in
order
to
obtain
a
valuable
license,
which--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
is
true.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
true,
and
there
is
yet
another
theory
of
the
mail
fraud
statute
which
we
have
not
raised
in
this
case
and
we
haven't
briefed
in
this
case,
which
holds
that
lying
to,
for
example,
the
state
in
order
to
obtain
a
regulatory
approval
that
will
then
allow
someone
to
obtain
money
from
a
third
party
fits
within
even
the
first
clause
of
the
mail
fraud
statute.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
that
congress
has
attempted
to
speak
very
clearly
and
comprehensively
in
the
mail
fraud
statute.
when
this
court
ruled
in
mcnally
that
it
did
not
apply
to
the
intangible
right
to
honest
services,
congress
came
back
and
amended
the
statute
to
make
clear
that
it
did
want
the
federal
government
in
that
line
of
business.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
suggest
that
it
does,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
even
taking
the
court's
own
holding
in
mcnally,
the
court's
holding
is
that
the
state
is
not
to
be
less
favored
than
a
private
party
insofar
as
it's
a
property
holder.
it's
to
be
treated
on
the
same
footing
if
the
defendant
uses
a
federal
jurisdictional
means
which
subjects
him
to
a
federal
regulatory
system,
and
there
are
lots
and
lots
of
defendants
who
make
false
statements
to
governments
in
connection
with
obtaining
money
or
property
or
even
defrauding
a
state
of
tax
revenue,
which
some
people
might
think
are
quintessential
things
for
the
states
to
handle
all
on
their
own.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
elements
of
the
two
statutes
are
different,
and
there
are
many
applications
where
1001
would
fit
where
we
wouldn't
necessarily
be
able
to
establish
a
scheme
to
defraud
under
the
mail
fraud
statute,
so
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
you'd...
under
our
second
theory,
we
do
not
need
to
show
that
there
is
an
intent
to
deprive
the
state
or
the
federal
government
of
a
property
interest,
whereas--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--in
some
ways
it's
broader,
and
in
some
ways
it's
narrower.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
mail
fraud
requires
a
use
of
the
jurisdictional
means
that
you
have
mail
fraud,
and
it
also
under
the
scheme
to...
you
need
to
have
proof
of
the
mails
in
other
words,
which
is
not
true
for
1001.
1001
involves
any
federal
agency,
any
false
statement
in
a
matter
within
the
federal
agency's
jurisdiction,
and
it
need
not
involve
any
money
or
property
loss
or
gain.
so
the
two
statutes
have
a
substantially
different
sweep.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
may
be
true,
and
there's
also
an
intent
element,
though,
in
the
mail
fraud
statute
of
an
intent
to
defraud,
which
is
not
present
in
the
1001.
1001
simply
applies
to
a
knowing
false
statement
within
the
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
agency.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
to
the
state?
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
certainly
the
second
clause
as
we
have
construed
it
would
apply
in
such
a
case,
because
the
employment
applicant
seeks
employment.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
a
misstatement
that
is
intended
to
result
in
a
greater
tax--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
but
justice
scalia,
that
would
be
covered
under
anybody's
interpretation
of
the
mail
fraud
statute,
because
it's
a
scheme
to
acquire
money
or
property
that
should
belong
to
the
state,
and
that's
fundamentally--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
the
state
has
a
right
to--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
i
read
the
statute
broadly
in
respect
of
money
or
property
losses
to
the
state,
and
apply
it
in
a
way
that
makes
it
congruent
with
what
a
private
party
would
be
subjected
to.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
trial
judge
combined
the
first
clause
and
the
second
clause
of
the
statute
which
were
charged
in
the
indictment.
he
combined
them
by
saying
a
scheme
to
defraud
by
making
false
or
fraudulent
representations
to
the
state.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
he
did,
but
a
jury
that
found
guilt
on
those
instructions
necessarily
found
that
the
object
of
the
scheme
was
to
make
false
statements
to
the
state
to
obtain
the
license
and,
indeed,
the
charged
mailings
were
the
mailings
of
the
license
to
the
defendants.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it's
exactly
included
within
what
the
jury
had
to
find
in
order
to
render
the
conviction
on
the
instructions
that
were
given.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there
are
no
guidelines
beyond
the
legal
requirements
for
charging
mail
fraud
that
are
given
to
federal
prosecutors.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
in
theory.
in
theory,
justice
ginsburg.
i
would
also
say
that
under
the
property
prong
of
mail
fraud
individual
prosecutors
have
discretion
on
what
level
of
case
they
are
going
to
bring,
and
the
competing
obligations
and
case
loads
of
federal
prosecutors
tend
to
send
those
cases
to
the
wayside,
but
there
are
small
cases
brought
even
where
the
state
is
defrauded
of
a
relatively
small
amount
of
property.
and
one
of
the
reasons
why
that
is
is
because
frauds
against
the
state
often
involve
state
actors
in
collusion
with
the
private
parties,
and
the
federal
government
there
serves
a
very
valuable
role
in
coming
in
and
being
able
to
prosecute
when
the
states
themselves
seem
to
be
less
able
to
do
so,
and
this
case
itself
had
a
corruption
component
in
it
involving
charges
against
state
senators,
which
the
jury
ended
up
rejecting,
but
there
was
a
reason
why
the
federal
government
was
involved
in
this
case
in
the
beginning.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
the
people
of
the
state
of
louisiana
are
actually
benefited
by
having
the
federal
government
available
as
a
supplementary
prosecutorial
tool.
thank
you.
