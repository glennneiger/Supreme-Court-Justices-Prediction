he
arrested
him,
handcuffed
him,
took
him
into

--and

why
shouldn't...
under
belton,
why
shouldn't
a
policeman
be
put
to
the
choice?
you
can
protect
yourself
the
belton
way,
do
an
immediate
search
while
the
arrested
person
is
still
nearby
the
car,
and
possibly
able
to
dive
in
and
get
a
gun,
or,
if
you
want
to
play
it
really
safe,
handcuff
him
and
take
him
back
to
the
police
cruiser.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
you
do
the
latter,
you've
assured
your
safety,
and
there's
no
basis
for
conducting
a
search.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
that's
not
a
hard
choice.
assure
your
safety.
if
you
can
handcuff
him
and
lead
him
to
the
car,
you're
safe.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
you're
saying
is,
you
think
the
officer
wants
to
be
able
to
search
the
car.
