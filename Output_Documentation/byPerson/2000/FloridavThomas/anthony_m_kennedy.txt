justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
do
we
express
that
limitation?
could
he
come
back
a
day
later?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
so
what's
the
general
principle
that
expresses
the
temporal
limitation
in
justice
o'connor's
inquiry?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
he
does
or
he
doesn't,
depending,
perhaps,
on
what
we
decide
in
this
case.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just...
following
justice
scalia,
if
the
justification
for
chimel,
or
chimel--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
that
you
must
protect
the
officer,
and
the
defendant,
or
the
suspect
is
in
the
patrol
car
in
handcuffs,
what
justification
is
there
left,
other
than
protecting
the
public
safety
by
inventory
searches
and
so
forth?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
under
chimel
itself,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
rationale
has
now
disappeared.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
the
cases
talk
about
whether
there's
a
possibility
that
persons
other
than
the
arrested
person
might
go
into
the
car,
i.e.,
there
might
have
been
somebody
in
the
house
that
would
have
gone
in
and
got
the
gun?
do
our
cases
talk
about
that
in
the
context
of
the
chimel
rule,
or
is
there
some
other
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
some
other
line
of
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
think
that
the
chimel
rule
may
apply
as
well
to
protect
the
officer
from
other
persons
who
might
grab
a
weapon,
or
destroy--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
so
that...
so
that,
then,
do
you
agree
that
under
the
chimel
rule,
a
search
can
be
made
to
protect
the
officer
not
just
against
the
contingency
of
the
arrested
person
grabbing
a
weapon,
but
of
other
persons?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
i'm
trying
to
help
you,
and
you
seem
to
be
resisting.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
the
policemen
have
gone
in
under
a
different
circumstance?
let's
assume
there
were
no
policemen
in
the
house
yet.
after
he
arrested
him
outside
of
the
car,
could
he
go
in
and
search
the
house?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
once
you've
searched
the
car,
you
can't
go
in
the
house,
but
once
you're
in
the
house,
you
can
go
out
and
search
the
car.
that's
the
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
as
i
understand
the
florida
rule,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
the
policeman
puts
the
siren
on,
stops
the
car,
and
the
man
runs
out
of
the
car
and
goes
and
talks
to
the
policeman.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in...
as
i
understand
the
rule,
the
police
have
no
justification
for
searching
the
car
under
chimel...
maybe
under
an
inventory...
but
under
chimel,
the
justification
for
the
search
evaporates,
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
a
silly
rule,
because
number
1,
it
encourages
everybody
to
jump
out
of
their
car.
