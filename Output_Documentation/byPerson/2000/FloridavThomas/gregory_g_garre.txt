mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
an
individual
is
arrested
alongside
the
car
that
he
has
just
occupied,
the
rule
of
new
york
v.
belton
permits
the
police
to
search
the
car
incident
to
the
arrest.
in
our
view,
that
is
true
regardless
of
the
reason
that
the
suspect
got
out
of
the
car
before
the
arrest.
the
florida
supreme
court's
contrary
ruling
in
this
case
should
be
reversed
for
three
reasons.
first,
it
compromises
officer
safety
in
the
dangerous
and
recurring
context
of
vehicle
side
arrests.
second,
it
needlessly
complicates--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--i'd
like
to
make
one
thing
clear
on
that
at
the
outset.
respondent
has
never
challenged
the
search
in
this
case
on
the
ground
that
it
was
not
contemporaneous
with
the
arrest.
that
was
not
a
basis
for
any
of
the
decisions
below.
it's
not
within
the
question
presented
by
petitioner.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
absolutely.
we
cite
statistics
in
our
brief,
i
believe
it's
on
page
22,
where
people
who
are
handcuffed
and
on
the
scene
do
continue
to
pose
a
danger
to
the
police.
we
think
that
with
respect
to
the
question--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--the
danger
was
related
to
the
fact
of
the
arrest,
and
that's
what
justifies
the
search
under
the
belton
doctrine
as
well
under
the
search
incident
to
arrest
doctrine.
when
someone
is
placed
under
arrest,
he
immediately
has
an
increased
incentive
to
get
to
a
weapon
that
may
be
nearby,
or
get
to
evidence
that
may
be
nearby.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
well,
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
important
for
the
court
to
recognize
that
this
case
is
a
little
bit
unusual
in
that
the
person
was
put
into
a
house.
in
the
more
typical
belton
situation--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--belton--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--the
justification
for
the
search
is
provided
by
the
arrest.
belton
requires
that
the
search
be
a
contemporaneous
incident
to
the
arrest,
and
we
think
in
a
situation
like
this,
where
the
search
and
the
arrest
are
plainly
part
of
the
same
process,
where
only
five
minutes
separates
the
arrest
from
the
search...
the
officer
on
this
scene
had
a
choice.
when
he
arrested
the
respondent
at
the
car,
he
was
by
himself
outside.
he
had
a
choice
of
leaving
the
respondent
unattended
by
the
car
as
he
searched
the
car,
or
he
had
the
choice
of
bringing
the
respondent
into
the
house,
which,
although
the
record
is
a
little
bit
unclear
on
this,
it
suggests
it
was
only
about
20
feet
away,
where
other
officers
were,
and
where
other
people
were
after
drug
arrests
had
been
made
in
that
house.
we
think
that
the
constitution
and
the
fourth
amendment
gives
the
officer
in
officer
maney's
position
the
leeway
to
make
that
choice,
and
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
a
different
regime,
it
would
be
inviting
all
the
sorts
of
line
drawing,
case
by
case
determinations
that
it
sought
to
foreclose
in
belton
with
respect
to
the
initial
just--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--with
respect--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
we--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--sure.
we
know
from
cases
like
preston
and
dyke
that
where
the
person
is
taken
off
the
scene,
he's
in
the
police
station,
his
car's
removed
from
the
scene,
that
that's
not
substantially
contemporaneous
under
the--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--well--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--we
think
the
scene
in
this
case
would
include
the
house.
the
respondent
drove
up
to
a
house
where
drug
related
arrests
were
being
made.
he
parked
in
the
driveway
right
outside
the
house.
he's
on
the--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--no.
the
belton
rule
is
limited
to
the
vehicle.
we're
not
asking--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--with
respect,
no.
the
rule
is
that
once
the
officer
has
a
justification
for
the
search,
the
search
must
be
contemporaneous
with
the
arrest,
and
we
think
that
that
requirement
is
met,
as
every
court
of
appeals
of
which
we
are
aware
has
held
that
it
has
been
met
where
the
search
and
the
arrest
are
part
of
the
same
process,
one
continuous
event.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
well,
every
case
is
comparable
in
that
the
officer
typically
puts
the
suspect
in
the
squad
car.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
which--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
and
we
think
that
that
case
is
unusual
in
that
respect,
but
we
would
urge
the
court
to
keep
very
much
in
mind
the
much...
very
typical
case
in
which
the
suspect
is
in
the
squad
car,
and
in
that
situation
it's
clear
that
we
think
that
the
search
would
be
contemporaneous
with
the
arrest,
and
again,
to
remind
the
court,
that
issue
we
don't
believe
is
before
the
court
in
this
case.
the
issue--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
we
think
that
the--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--we
think
that
there
is
jurisdiction.
we
think
that
the
belton
issue
has
been
finally
decided,
and
the
way
it's
been
decided
is
based
on
the
proposition
on
which
this
court
granted
certiorari,
which
is
whether
or
not
the
application
of
the
belton
rule
depends
on
initiation
of
contact
with
the
suspect
in
the
car,
and
there
are
situations
where
police
come
upon
a
suspect
after
he's
gotten
out
of
the
car.
michigan
v.
long,
which
was
decided
just
a
year
after
this
court's
decision
in
belton,
is
that
type
of
situations.
police
may
be
conducting
surveillance
activities.
they
may
choose
that
for
their
own
safety
it's
not
wise
to
initiate
contact
while
the
person's
in
the
car.
the
supreme
court,
the
florida
supreme
court's
rule
in
this
case
is,
it
compromises
officer
safety,
because
it
requires--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--that
may
not
be
enough
in
itself,
but
that,
coupled
with
the
fact
that
if
the
state
were
to
prevail
on
remand,
the
belton
issue
would
be
lost,
the
state
of
florida
and
officers
in
florida
would
be
governed
by
the
florida
supreme
court's
erroneous
interpretation
of
belton
in
this
case--
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
--we've
cited
cases
that
are
interlocutory
in
the
respect
that
they
come
up
on
a
suppression
motion,
new
york
v.
quarles
in
our
brief.
this
case,
we
believe
it's
very
important
for
this
court
to
decide
the
federal
question
presented.
if
the
state
did
lose...
did
prevail
on
remand,
that
issue
would
be
lost.
we
think
that
there's
a
compelling
federal
interest
in
this
court
setting
the
florida
supreme
court
straight
on
the
proper
application
of
belton,
that
the
application
of
that
rule
does
not
depend
on
a
requirement
that
the
officer
initiate
contact
with
the
suspect
while
he's
still
in
the
car.
mr.
gen
gregory
g.
garre
that
issue
was
never
raised
by
the
respondent
in
this
case,
and
we
don't
believe
it's
within
the
question
presented.
it's
not
even
within
the
question
formulated
by
the
respondent
in
the
opposition
brief.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
