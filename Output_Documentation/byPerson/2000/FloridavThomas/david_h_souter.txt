justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may
have
been
part
of
one
ongoing
transaction,
but
it...
that
does
not,
i
think,
affect
the
fact
that
the
moment
of
the
search
seems
to
have
been
totally
untethered
from
the
justifications
for
the
belton
rule
because,
as
i
understand
it,
at
the
time
the
search
was
made,
the
defendant
was
in
the
house.
the
defendant
couldn't
reach
into
the
car
for
weapons
or
for
evidence.
there
was
nobody
else
with
the
defendant
still
in
the
car
who
could
have
done
so,
so
that
it
seems
to
me
the
justification
for
the
belton
rule
has
vanished,
totally,
in
this
situation.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
that's
going
to
be
your
justification,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
put
any
limitation
on
it
at
all,
because
there
was
just
as
much
an
arrest
24
hours
later,
or
48
hours
later.
there
was
just
as
much
an
arrest
as
if
he
had
been
3
miles
away,
or
30
miles
away,
and
on
your
reasoning
that
the
moment
of
arrest
is
the
only
operative
moment
here,
then
they
could
search
2
days
later,
and
they
could
search
30
miles
away.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
don't
see
why
continuing
course
of
arrest
has
any
relevance
except
in
relation
to
the
preservation
of
evidence
that
he
might
otherwise
destroy,
or
the
possibility
of
a
weapon
that
he
might
have
used
to
hurt
the
officer,
and
when
each
of
those
possibility,
possibilities
has
been
definitively
negated,
what
is
left
of
belton?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
so
i
can
understand,
under
the
belton
rule,
that
they
could
search
then,
but
they
didn't.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
when
they
did,
he
wasn't
within
immediate
reach
of
the
vehicle.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
anything
in
any
of
those
cases
that's
comparable
to
taking
him
out
of
the
car
and
putting
him
in
a
house?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
the
squad
car.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
gave
you
the
squad
car.
i
said,
the
squad
car
is
part
of
the
scene.
i'm
saying,
is
there
anything
in
the
cases
that's
comparable
to
the
house?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
belton
would
apply
even
if
the
individual
was
standing
outside
the
car.
he
might
not
have
any
weapon
on
him,
he
might
not
have
any
evidence
on
him,
but
if,
in
the
course
of
the
interview
with
the
officer,
he
thought
it
was
in
his
interest
to
leap
back
into
the
car,
or
grab
into
the
car
and
get
a
gun,
or
get
some
evidence
that
he
could
swallow,
or
something
of
that
sort,
the...
that
was
the
justification
for
belton,
and
i
would
suppose
that
that
would
be
the
justification,
even
if
the
individual
had
himself
voluntarily
gotten
out
of
the
car.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
that
is
so,
then
the
florida
distinction
really
cannot
be
sustained.
