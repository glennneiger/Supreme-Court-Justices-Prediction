justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
why
is
that,
because
it
says
in
belton...
it
says
as
a
contemporaneous...
as
a
contemporaneous--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
that
arrest.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
and
belton
is
extrapolated
and
explained
in
chimel,
so
can
you...
in
chimel
you
can
search
the
room
when
you
arrest
somebody
who's
in
the
house,
so
under
chimel,
can
you
arrest
a
person
in
the
house,
take
him
down
to
the
police
station,
and
go
back
and
search
the
room?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
isn't
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--key
word,
contemporaneous,
just
what
everybody's
been
saying?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
so
if
he's
taken
off
the
scene,
why
isn't
the
scene
where
the
policeman,
the
police
car,
and
the
car
are
all
there
together,
but
what
isn't
the
scene
is
a
house?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
that
would
be
like
common
sense.
when
you
arrest
somebody
in
a
car,
a
house,
inside
the
house
anyway,
isn't
the
scene.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
jurisdiction,
then,
here,
because
in
fact
there
is
a
problem
they
haven't
passed
definitively
in
florida
on
the
question
of
whether
the
evidence
should
be
suppressed,
and
your
side
has
two
more
arguments
to
make,
or
one,
and
the
other
side
has
one.
one
is
the
house,
and
the
other
one
is
whether
chimel
would
justify
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
don't
have
a
final
judgment
either
on
the
suppression
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what?
that
is
to
say,
i'm
having
a
hard
time
seeing
how
a
person...
i
mean,
i
read
belton,
and
i
don't
understand
how
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
having
read
it,
could
come
to
its
conclusion.
what
belton
says,
in
exact
language
is,
it
says,
as
a
custodial
arrest
of
the
occupant,
as
a
contemporaneous
incident
of
that
arrest,
you
may
search
the
passenger
compartment,
and
then
to
make
clear
what
they're
talking
about,
they
say,
we're
asking
when
police
may
search
inside
the
automobile
after
the
arrestee
is
no
longer
in
it,
all
right.
now,
i
read,
after
the
arrestee
is
no
longer
in
it,
you
may
search
the
passenger
compartment
as
a
contemporaneous
incident
of
the
arrest.
that's
what
the
language
says,
so
now,
where
does
this
distinction
come
from--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
distinction
as
to
whether
the
person
voluntarily
got
out
of
the
car,
after
there
was
eye
contact,
before
there
was
eye
contact?
where
does
that
come
from?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
person...
they're
talking
about
people
who
are
no
longer
occupants.
belton
says
it's
talking
about
a
person
after
the
arrestee
is
no
longer
in
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and,
of
course,
the
person
in
belton
was
no
longer
in
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
evidence
in
the
case
against
him,
aside
from
the
drugs
they
received,
any
significant
evidence?
in
other
words,
if
you
win
your
suppression
motion,
is...
as
a
practical
matter,
is
that
the
end
of
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well
then,
this,
as
a
practical
matter,
it's
over.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
either...
because
you'll
win
the
chimel
issue,
i
would
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
he
was
in
the
house,
i
don't
see
he's
going
to
grab
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
