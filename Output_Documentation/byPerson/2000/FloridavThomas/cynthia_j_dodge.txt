ms.
cynthia
j.
dodge
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
facts
in
this
case
are
very,
very
different
from
the
facts
confronting
the
officer
in
belton.
in
belton,
the
officer
stopped
a
car
for
speeding
on
a
busy
thruway.
it
was
the
new
york
thruway.
the
officer
was
confronted
with
four
individuals.
when
he
approached
the
car,
he
smelled
the
odor
of
burnt
marijuana,
and
he
looked
inside,
and
saw
an
envelope
marked
super
gold.
that
envelope
he
immediately
recognized
as
being
associated
with
marijuana.
therefore,
he
had
probable
cause
to
believe
not
only
that
these
four
passengers
were
in
possession
of
marijuana,
but
that
they
had
used
marijuana
because
of
the
burnt
marijuana
smoke.
he
ordered
the
passengers
out
of
the
car
and
placed
them
under
arrest.
he
did
not
handcuff
them,
either
because
he
could
not,
because
there
were
four
of
them,
or
because
he
chose
not
to
do
so.
what
he
did
to
protect
himself
was
merely
to
separate
them
on
the
thruway.
he
separated
them
so
that
they
could
not
touch
each
other,
being
in
reaching
distance
of
each
other,
and
this
was
one
officer
without
backup,
and
he
was
confronted
with
four
individuals.
with
the--
ms.
cynthia
j.
dodge
--no,
certainly
not.
ms.
cynthia
j.
dodge
it
makes
a
difference
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
mr.
thomas
didn't
suspect
that
the
officer
wanted
to
make
contact
with
him,
so
he
did
not
have
an
incentive
to
grab
any
weapons
or
destroy
evidence,
because
the
officer
was
merely
there,
and
he
hadn't
signaled
his
desire
to
make
contact
with
mr.
thomas
at
the
time.
ms.
cynthia
j.
dodge
perhaps
so.
however,--
ms.
cynthia
j.
dodge
--the
way
i
see
it
is
that
once
a
person
gets
out
of
the
car
on
his
own,
without
the
prompting
from
the
officer
or
without
initiating
contact,
he's
outside
of
the
car,
and
the
regular
considerations
of
chimel
control.
in
other
words,
what
this
contact
rule
does
is,
it
doesn't
say
to
the
officer,
you're
not
allowed
ever
to
search
the
car.
if
you
feel
as
though
the
person
is
within
actual
grabbing
area,
in
other
words,
if
you
are
overwhelmed,
if
the
door
is
open--
ms.
cynthia
j.
dodge
--yes,
i
think
they
are,
because
when
you
look
at
belton
itself,
belton
allows
the
search
of
an
occupant's
vehicle
pursuant
to
arrest.
when
you
get
to
a
consideration
of
who
is
a
recent
occupant,
then
your
bright
line
evaporates,
because
the...
on
page
5
of
the
blue
brief,
petitioner
proposes
a
rule.
if
a
valid
custodial
arrest
of
an
occupant
or
recent
occupant
of
a
motor
vehicle
has
been
effected--
ms.
cynthia
j.
dodge
--a
contemporaneous
search
is
allowed.
ms.
cynthia
j.
dodge
yes,
your
honor,
he
was
a
recent
occupant.
however--
ms.
cynthia
j.
dodge
--correct.
however,
what
the
florida
supreme
court
has
done
is
drafted
a
bright
line
definition
of
the
term,
occupant.
so
in
other
words,
once
you
get...
someone
has
left
the
car--
ms.
cynthia
j.
dodge
--no.
what
i
think
that
they
saw
was
that
there
was...
they
made
a
rule
that
in
essence
dovetails
with
the
rule
in
belton.
it
sees
that
there
is
a
problem
in
that
there's
no
definition
of
who
is
an
occupant,
and
it's
very
hard
to
determine
who
is
a
recent
occupant,
because
of
the
fact
that,
you
know,
somebody
could
distance
themselves
very
quickly
from
a
car.
they
could
also
have
gone
into
a
convenience
store,
or
into
a
supermarket.
ms.
cynthia
j.
dodge
his
car--
ms.
cynthia
j.
dodge
--correct.
ms.
cynthia
j.
dodge
correct,
and
the
florida
rule
eliminates
that
possibility.
once
the
officer
signaled
contact,
the
person
could
jump
and
run
as
far
as
he
wants,
and
that
car
is...
it
can
be
searched.
so
in
other
words,
if
it
were
a
knowledgeable
subject
it
would
be
a
disincentive
to
distance
yourself,
because
not
only
that,
you
might
get
a
charge
for
fleeing
and
eluding.
you're
running
out
of
the
car,
but
that
car
is
always
subject
to
search
once
that
officer
has
put
on
those
lights,
has
put
on
the
siren,
has
announced
over
a
loudspeaker
that
he
wishes
confrontation,
has
shouted,
hey
you,
sir.
it
covers
even
when
an
officer
wishes
to
initiate
a
consensual
encounter.
ms.
cynthia
j.
dodge
the
court--
ms.
cynthia
j.
dodge
--the
court
believed
that
mr.
thomas
was
no
longer
an
occupant.
ms.
cynthia
j.
dodge
yes.
ms.
cynthia
j.
dodge
yes.
he
had
been
removed
from
the
car
by
the
officer
in
order
to,
number
1,
effectuate
the
arrest.
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
search
a
car
with
four
people
in
it,
or
even
one
person
in
it.
it
would
be
impractical
to
do
so.
not
only
that,
i
think
it
would
be
very
dangerous
to
tell
a
person
who
is
still
in
control
of
the
accelerator,
the
steering
wheel,
and
the
key,
you
are
under
arrest.
i
think
that
that
might
be
an
invitation
to
get
run
over,
so
it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
wait
and
say,
would
you
please
get
out
of
the
car,
and
now
that
he
has
some
modicum
of
control
over
this
individual,
because
in
mimms
face
to
face
confrontation
reduces
the
danger,
then
say,
sir,
i
am
placing
you
under
arrest.
ms.
cynthia
j.
dodge
yes,
your
honor.
that
person
would
not
come
under
the
automatic
belton
rule.
in
other
words,
the
person
is
distancing
themselves
from
the
car.
however,
if
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
that
person
is
going
to
the
crack
house
and
is
carrying
contraband,
then
the
car
could
be
searched
pursuant
to
the
automobile
exception,
so
it
would
be
a
decision...
the
officer
in
that
case
might
want
to
search
that
car.
he
might
desperately
want
to
do
so,
to
see
what's
in
it,
but
it
doesn't
equate
with
the
necessity
to
do
so
to
protect
himself
or
to
protect
any
evidence
that
someone
might
grab
during
an
arrest
process
that
occurs
as
the
person
has
distanced
himself
from
the
car.
ms.
cynthia
j.
dodge
correct.
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
has
to
be
a
nexus,
for
example,
if
an
officer
were
following
a
car,
he
knew
the
occupant's
identity,
and
he
knew
for
sure
that
there
had
been
a
warrant
issued
for
the
arrest,
he
would
be
stopping
for
the
warrant
and
not
for
a
traffic
violation,
so
that
there
would
not
be,
necessarily,
a
nexus,
other
than
the
fact
that
the
person
is
in
the
car
at
the
time
that
he
is
actually
apprehended,
or
the
officer's
pursuing
him.
what
this
does...
and
i
believe
the
florida
courts
have
never
considered
the
chimel
aspects,
or
chimel
aspects
of
this
case.
they've
never
decided
whether
or
not
the
passenger
compartment
and
all
of
the
closed
containers,
the
glove
box,
the
pocket
on
the
side
of
the
door
were
still
within
the
actual
grabbing
area
of
mr.
thomas.
in
fact,
the
record
is
rather
sparse
with
regard
to
the
facts.
we
know
that
the
door
was
closed.
however,
we
don't
know
whether
or
not
the
door
was
locked.
we
know
that
mr.
thomas
was
in
the
company
of
at
least
three
or
four
narcotics
agents
who
were
in
the
house
finishing
up
the
arrests
of
the
residents,
so
what
we're
saying
is,
this
case
isn't
really
finished.
it
was
remanded
back
to
the
trial
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
officer
could
have
searched
the
car
under
chimel,
or
chimel.
ms.
cynthia
j.
dodge
yes,
it
is.
ms.
cynthia
j.
dodge
there
was
nothing
found
on
his
person.
ms.
cynthia
j.
dodge
yes,
sir.
ms.
cynthia
j.
dodge
i--
ms.
cynthia
j.
dodge
--i
would
hope
so.
ms.
cynthia
j.
dodge
well,
we
believe
that
the
contact
rule
is
a
reasonable
rule,
even
though
it
does...
it
does,
admittedly,
it
expands
belton,
but
it's
reasonable,
because
the
officer
starts
the
person's
thought
processes,
adrenaline
going
the
minute
he
starts
saying,
you
know,
i
would
like
to
have
contact
with
you.
there
are
officers
on
the
street
everywhere.
not
any
of
them
is
a
threat
to
an
individual
unless
the
officer
is
in
pursuit
of
that
individual,
or
has
somehow
put
him
on
notice
that
there's
going
to
be
some
kind
of
confrontation.
so
i
think
it's
a
good
balance
to
be
struck
between
the
privacy
rights
of
an
individual
in
a
vehicle
and
in
his
containers,
because
belton
does...
it
does
cover
containers
therein,
very
personal
items.
that
would
be
purses,
brief
cases,
anything
that's
in
the
console,
any
decorations
or
mail
that
you
might
happen
to
be
carrying
from
the
post
office...
if
you
picked
it
up
at
your
post
office
box,
that
might
be
carried
in
your
car...
and
so
it's
a
good
rule
that
protects
both
the
officers
and
the
individual's
right
to
privacy.
if
there
are
no
other
questions--
