mr.
robert
j.
krauss
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
florida
supreme
court,
based
on
the
facts
before
it,
added
an
unreasonable
and
unwarranted
condition
to
this
court's
holding
in
new
york
v.
belton.
the
florida
supreme
court
has
determined
that
it
is
improper
to
conduct
a
belton
search
unless
the
police
initiate
contact
with
the
arrestee
while
he
is
still
in
the
automobile,
or
he
exited
at
the
direction
of
the
police.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
very
simple.
mr.
thomas
drove
his
vehicle
into
the
driveway
of
a
residence
of
a
home
at
which
drug
arrests
were
being
effected
at
the
time.
mr.
thomas
exited
his
vehicle,
walked
around
the
car,
and
was
at
the
rear
right,
near
the
trunk,
when
detective
maney
stopped
him.
detective
maney
asked
mr.
thomas
for
his
name
and
for
his
driver's
license.
an
immediate
check
of
that
driver's
license
was
run,
and
it
came
back
outstanding.
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
detective
maney
had
been
in
the
house.
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
i
don't...
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
absolutely.
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
yes,
sir,
within
5
minutes
of...
this
whole
entire
episode
took
5
minutes
from
when--
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
--yes,
we
do,
your
honor,
for--
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
--we
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
ability
to
effect
valid
arrest
arises
at
the
moment
of
that
arrest.
at
the
time
of
arrest,
mr.
thomas
was
right
by
the
car.
quite
frankly--
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
--no.
no,
there
obviously
is
a
limitation
at
some
point,
but
certainly
this
case
is
not
one
of
them.
this
was--
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
--well--
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
--no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
this
was
part
of
one
ongoing
transaction.
there
were
no--
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
--justice
souter,
we
submit
that
the
arrest,
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
that
is
when
the
ability
to
search
arises.
what
the
court
is--
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
--no,
your
honor.
as
i
stated,
there
has
to...
it
has
to
be
part
of
a
continuing
course
of
arrest.
it's
an
arrest
scenario,
and
it
should
not
be
broken
up.
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
well,
because
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
mr.
thomas,
or
any
similarly
situated
defendant
is
at
the
car,
and
therefore
he
is
within
reach,
immediate
reach
of
the
vehicle.
it
is
almost--
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
--well,
they
did--
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
--that's
correct.
it's
near
unanimous
in
all
the
federal
circuits
and
most
of
the
states,
as
we've
provided
in
the
briefs,
that
even
if
a
suspect
is
handcuffed
and
led
away
from
the
scene,
and
sometimes
often
placed
in
a
police
vehicle
himself,
that
a
belton
search
is
still
permissible.
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
as
a
contemporaneous--
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
--yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
not
necessarily,
because
there
may
be
too
much
of
an
intervening
time.
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
what
the
court--
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
--what
the
court's
suggesting,
if
i
may,
is
that
the
police
should
have
to
make
a
choice
right
at
that
moment
when
they
effect
the
arrest,
either
do
i
search
the
car,
because
i
know
i
have
the
right
to
do
so,
or
should
i
take
steps
to
secure
the
defendant
at
the
scene,
so
as...
so
you
have
two--
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
--they
could,
your
honor,
and
there
are
different
fact
patterns
that
emerge.
we're...
i...
we
are
presupposing
that
there's
one
defendant
involved.
a
lot
of
these
cases
involve--
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
agreed.
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
there
may
be,
your
honor.
there's...
and
i
think
we've
certainly
conceded
that
in
our
brief,
that
certain
searches
will
be
taken
without--
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
--absolutely.
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
yes,
your
honor.
it
would
certainly...
if
we're
talking
about
the
contemporaneous
requirement,
certainly
it
would
have
to
be,
and
that's
why
i
suggest
that,
especially
in
this
case,
where
it
was
one
flowing,
fluid
arrest
scenario,
where
mr.
thomas
was
placed
under
arrest
right
when
he
was
by
the
car,
and
that
is
when
the
need
to
either
preserve
evidence
or
exhibit
concern
for
officer
safety
arises,
at
that
moment.
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
i
respectfully
submit
to
you,
justice
ginsburg,
that
in
this
case
the
state
could
not
have
conducted
an
inventory
search.
first
of
all,
the
vehicle
was
not
even
mr.
thomas'.
second
of
all,
it
was
already
parked
in
the
driveway.
it
did
not
pose
any
safety
hazards,
say,
that
colorado
v.--
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
--and
i
also
have
concern
because,
even
though
there
were
several
people
that
were
arrested
in
the
house,
mr.
thomas'
sister
was
not,
and
there's
nothing
that
could
have
said
that
she
couldn't
have
moved...
if
it
was
necessary
to
move
the
car,
that
she
couldn't
have
been
the
one
to
move
it,
and
if
she
has
an
ability
to
remove
it,
she
obviously
has
the
ability
to
get
any
weapons
or
destroy
any
evidence
that
was
in
the
car
also.
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
because
i--
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
--because
i
don't
necessarily
believe
that
in
the
volatile
and
dangerous
situation
that
is
the
arrest,
that
we
have
to
give
the
police
these
types
of
choices
to
make.
the...
especially--
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
--but
i
don't
know
that
the
officer
would
want
to
make
the
wrong
choice
at
that
point.
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
no,
your
honor.
i
think
the
officer
has
the
constitutional
right
to
search
the
car,
because
he
arrested
someone
who
was
in
proximity
to
the
car
at
the
time
of
the
arrest.
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
and
i
will
submit
that
that's
why
the
court
accepted
this
case,
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
i
think
those
are
very
valid
justifications,
and--
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
--well,
chimel...
belton
was
created
just
so
the
police
don't
have
to
make
these
case
by
case
determinations
as
to
what
the
area
to
search
is,
so...
and
i
do
come
back
to
the
quote
in
u.s.
v.
robinson,
where
the
very
fact
of
arrest
alone
is
enough
to
justify
the
search,
and
it's
the
same
situation
in
a
belton
search.
i
would
further
submit
that
at
least
via
dicta,
this
court
has
recognized
the
point
of
law
we
are
advancing
today
in
michigan
v.
long.
it
was
assumed
in
a
footnote
that
had
the
suspect
in
that
case
been
arrested
for
speeding
or
driving
along
intoxicated,
that
a
valid
belton
search
could
be
effected--
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
--and
that's
what
we
have
here.
mr.--
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
--he
was
taken--
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
--there
were
other
officers
in
the
house
at
the
time,
because
they
had
been
effecting
some
drug
arrests
at
the
time.
they
brought
mr.
thomas
in
there
for
safekeeping,
not
unlike
the
common
situation
that's
assumed
in
these
cases,
where
a
suspect
is
handcuffed
and
placed
in
the
patrol
car.
as
we
have
stated,
the
need
to
do
the
search
arises
at
the
time
that
he
is
arrested
in
the
proximity
of
the
car.
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
immediately
thereafter.
the
entire
procedure,
from
when
mr.
thomas
exited
his
car,
the
warrant
was
checked,
and
he
was
taken
into
the
house,
and
then
the
officer
came
back
and
completed
the
search,
all
within
five
minutes.
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
as
far
as
other--
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
--i'm
not
aware
of
any,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
no.
i
think
when
you're
at
the
scene
and
you're
dealing
with
vehicles,
there
are
different
interests
involved.
we
are
dealing
with
an
automobile
versus
a
home.
there
are
certainly
further
protections
in
a
home,
and
when
you're
in
a
situation
on
the
street,
where
anything
can
happen,
it's
a
volatile
situation,
there
may
be
other
codefendants
or
other
confederates
mulling
about,
the
ability
for
the
police
to
protect
themselves
is
paramount.
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
yes,
but
it
does
not--
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
--the
chimel
rule
helps,
but
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
chimel
is
limited
to
the
immediate
area
of
control,
whereas
belton
is
a
little
more
expansive,
in
that
you
have
defined
what
that
area
is,
and
i
think
that
is
a
little
more
expansive,
and
i
am
saying
that
belton
would
assist
the
officer
in
that
type
of
situation
if
there
are
others
in
the
area,
absolutely.
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
agreed,
your
honor,
and
we
would
submit
that
there
is
no
nexus,
as
the
court
is
suggesting.
no
nexus
is
necessary.
for
authority
for
that
proposition,
we
would
rely
on
united
states
v.
robinson,
where--
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
--i--
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
--no,
definitely
not.
this
officer
had
no
suspicions,
and
i'll
be
even
further
candid
with
the
court.
if
mr.
thomas
had
said,
no,
i'm
not
going
to
give
you
my
name
or
license,
the
officer
candidly
said,
i
couldn't
have
done
anything
about
it,
so
those
are
the
facts
that
we're
dealing
with.
if
the
court
has
no
objection,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
robert
j.
krauss
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
just
want
to
address
very
briefly
the
jurisdictional
issue
that
justice
breyer
raised.
it
would
be
our
point
that,
first
of
all,
what
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
done
has
remanded
to
determine
whether
the
chimel
factors
exist.
that
is
a
question
of
fact.
no
matter
how
that
is
determined
below,
the
question
of
law
that
has
been
decided,
the
question
of
fourth
amendment
interpretation
made
by
the
florida
supreme
court
limiting
this
court's
belton
holding
is
going
to
survive,
and
we
therefore
submit
that
this
court
certainly
has
jurisdiction.
it's
the
final
decision
of
the
highest
court
in
the
state,
and
it
will
not
be
modified.
lastly,
i
would
just
like
to
point
out,
at
pages
31
and
32
of
respondent's
brief,
they
make
a
statement
that
the
danger
arises
to
the
officer
at
the
moment
that
contact
is
made
with
the
arrestee.
well,
in
this
case,
as
in
many
cases
that
we've
cited,
that
danger
arises
regardless
of
the
reason.
therefore,
if
the
arrestee
voluntarily
exits,
it
makes
no...
there
is
no
constitutional
distinction.
thank
you.
