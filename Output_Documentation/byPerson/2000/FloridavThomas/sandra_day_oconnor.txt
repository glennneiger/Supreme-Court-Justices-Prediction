justice
sandra
day
o'connor
wasn't
one
of
the
stated
objectives
of
the
belton
rule
to
protect
officers
from
the
person
connected
with
the
car
from
reaching
in
and
getting
weapons
or
damaging
the
officer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
search
of
the
vehicle
came
later.
is
there
some
temporal
or
spatial
limitation
to
the
belton
rule,
or
do
you
say
there's
no
such
limitations?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
might
be,
if
you
take
the
person
away.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
presumably
the
police
could
secure
the
car
and
go
get
a
warrant
to
search
it,
couldn't
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we're
talking
about
this
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
court
below
thought
it
turned
on
whether
the
person
stayed
in
the
car,
or
exited
on
his
own.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
i'm
not
sure
that
belton
had
much
to
do
with
that
distinction.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there
may
well
be
other
limitations
of
space
and
time--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
after
the
person
has
been
removed...
arrested
and
handcuffed
and
removed
from
the
scene,
put
in
a
house,
what's
left
of
belton
to
justify
the
officer
going
back
to
the
car
and
making
a
search?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
do
you
mind
answering
the
question
that
i
asked?
so
it's
unusual.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
what
is
left
of
the
belton
justification
for
going
back
to
the
car
and
making
a
search
later?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
don't
think
belton's
limited
to
an
arrest
of
four
people,
surely?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
this,
and
why
does
the
reason
for
the
person
arrested
leaving
the
car
make
a
difference
for
belton?
what
difference
could
it
possibly
make
that
the
person
arrested
here
voluntarily
got
out
of
the
car,
as
opposed
to
being
ordered
out?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
probably
erred
in
drawing
that
line.
i
mean,
i
don't
see
any
justification
at
all
in
this
court's
cases,
and
certainly
not
in
belton,
for
the
line
the
florida
court
drew.
