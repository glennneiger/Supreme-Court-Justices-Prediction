h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
00-391,
florida
v.
thomas.
mr.
krauss.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
certainly
the
whole
basis
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
reasonableness--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
you
would
have
to...
whatever
the
interval
would
be,
it
would
have
to
be
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
krauss--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
krauss,
what
exactly
was
done
with
mr.
thomas,
when
he
was
taken
into
the...
he
had
driven
up
in
the
driveway.
he
was
taken
into
the
house,
and
what
happened?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
record
show?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
he
was
taken
into
the
house,
handcuffed,
and
then
the
officer
came
out.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
krauss.
mr.
garre,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
doesn't
depend
on
any
5-minute
interval,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
garre.
ms.
dodge,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
ms.
dodge,
one
of
the
virtues
of
belton,
as
stated
in
its
opinion,
is
that
it
was
a
bright
line
rule,
without
all
these
nuances
that
you're
adding
to
it.
do
you
think
that
the
nuances...
and
certainly
they
are
adopted
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
its
opinion...
are
really
consistent
with
that
sort
of
a
bright
line
rule?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--there
are
always
lines
to
be
drawn
in
fourth
amendment
cases,
but
in
this
case,
certainly,
mr.
thomas
was
about
as
recent
an
occupant
as
there
could
have
been,
other
than
someone
who
simply
stayed
in
the
car.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
belton
the
people
were
no
more
than
recent
occupants.
they
didn't
remain
in
the
car.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
dodge.
mr.
krauss,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
krauss.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
second
case
which
i
have
to
announce
is
no.
00-391,
florida
against
thomas.
here,
a
respondent
robert
thomas
got
out
of
his
car
in
the
driveway
of
a
home
where
police
were
investigating
drug
sales
and
encountered
an
officer
at
the
rear
of
his
car.
the
officer
arrested
thomas
on
an
outstanding
warrant,
took
him
inside
the
house
and
searched
the
car
finding
drugs.
the
trial
court
suppressed
the
evidence.
the
court
of
appeals
of
florida
reversed
saying
the
search
was
valid
under
our
decision
in
a
case
called
new
york
against
belton
where
we
held
that
an
officer
who
makes
the
lawful
custodial
arrest
of
a
car’s
occupant
may
search
the
car’s
passenger
compartment
incident
to
that
arrest.
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
turn
reversed
that
court
saying
that,
belton
is
limited
to
situations
where
the
officer
initiates
conduct
with
the
vehicle’s
occupant
while
the
person
is
still
in
the
vehicle.
the
court
remanded
the
case
to
the
trial
court
to
decide
whether
the
search
was
valid
under
another
of
our
cases
called
chimel
against
california.
we
granted
certiorari
to
determine
whether
belton
is
subject
to
the
limits
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
imposed.
but
because
we
find
that
court’s
judgment
is
not
final,
we
dismiss
the
writ
of
certiorari
for
want
of
jurisdiction
in
a
unanimous
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today.
we
are
authorized
by
statute
to
review
final
judgments
of
state
courts.
in
four
categories
of
cases
set
out
in
cox
broadcasting
company
against
cohn,
we
have
treated
state
court
judgments
as
final
for
jurisdictional
purposes
although
further
proceeding
will
take
place
in
state
court.
but
none
of
these
categories
fits
the
judgment
of
the
florida
supreme
court
and
much
as
justice
souter
just
said
about
tax
law,
the
law
of
jurisdiction
of
final
judgments
is
not
terribly
easy
to
explain
orally
and
no
more
interesting
to
hear
probably.
so,
i
will
leave
you
with
the
idea
which
is
true,
that
we
therefore
dismiss
the
writ
of
certiorari
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
