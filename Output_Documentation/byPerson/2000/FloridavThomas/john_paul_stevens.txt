justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask...
i
forget
the
facts
a
little
bit.
did
the
officer
go
into
the
house
and
come
back
out
before
he
arrested
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
after
the
man,
after
the
defendant
drove
into
the
driveway
and
got
out,
did
the
officer,
before
he
arrested
him,
go
into
the
house
and
come
back
out?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask...
excuse
me.
are
you
not
finished
with
your
answer?
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you,
if
you
hadn't
finished
your
answer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
do
you
think
at
the
time,
after
the
man
was
arrested,
there
was
probable
cause
to
search
the
car?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
you
about
that,
taking
one
at
a
time.
what
was
the
particular
threat
to
the
officer
after
the
man
was
in
the
house
and
under...
in
the
custody
of
the
police?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
that
responds
to
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
danger
was
totally
unrelated
to
the
car,
wasn't
it,
because
he
was
in
the
house.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
wonder
if
your
view
doesn't
require
new
line
drawing
where
we've
gotten
the
line
already
drawn
in
belton.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
you
say
5
minutes.
what
about
10
minutes,
15
minutes--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--2
hours?
