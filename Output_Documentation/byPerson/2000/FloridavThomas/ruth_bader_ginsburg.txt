justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why...
mr.
krauss,
he's
in
the
house
with
handcuffs,
so
any
concern
about
his
destroying
evidence
or
getting
a
weapon
is
attenuated,
but
the
need
with
respect,
even
to
the
car...
isn't
it
ordinarily
the
case
that
if
you
arrest
a
person,
and
there's
the
car
out
there
on
the
street,
the
car
will
be
impounded,
and
there
will
be
an
inventory
inspection,
and
there
will
turn
up
the
same
thing
that
this
turned
up
on
the
scene,
so
why
do
the
police,
once
they've
gotten
the
driver
out
of
it,
have
to
search
on
the
spot,
instead
of
going
through
the
lawful
procedure
of
getting
the
inventory--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
made
a
difference
that
he
was
parked
in
the
driveway,
rather
than
on
the
street.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
krauss,
there's
another
distinction,
another
unusual
feature
of
this
case,
in
addition
to
the
defendant
being
removed
from
the
scene.
that
is,
in
belton
the
man
was
speeding,
i
think.
in
all
the
other
cases
that
i
know
of,
there
was
a
stop
because
of
a
traffic
violation,
and
here,
the
car
wasn't
implicated
in
the
justification
for
the
arrest
at
all.
he
wasn't
doing
anything
wrong
with
the
car.
the
car
is
totally
apart
from...
the
justification
for
the
arrest
is
the
probation
violation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
said
there
was
no
nexus
requirement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
going
back
to
the
finality,
which
you
went
over
very
quickly,
is
that
enough
that
this
issue
has
been
to
florida,
it's
not
going
to
redesign
the
belton
issue?
is
that
enough
to
make
a
state
judgment
final
for
purposes
of
this
court's
review?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
have
a
similar
fourth
amendment
case
where
we
treated
the
judgment
as
final
for
purposes
of
our
review?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
dodge,
your
stress
on
confrontation,
or
at
least
signaling,
leaves
out
the
case
where
the
police
are
tailing
someone
because
they
think
they
will
be
led
to
the
crack
house,
and
they
deliberately
do
not
want
to
confront
or
signal,
so
in
your
argument,
i
take
it,
someone
in
that
situation
would
not
come
within
the
belton
rule,
because
the
police
hadn't
signaled,
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
are
supporting
the
florida
rule
about,
is
it
confrontation
or
signal,
but
you're
not
stressing...
you
don't
put
any
weight
on
the
absence
of
a
nexus
here,
that
this,
unlike
the
belton
line
of
cases,
did
not
involve
a
traffic
violation?
