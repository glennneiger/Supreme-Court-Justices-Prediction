justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
you
think
the...
that
that
information
in
those
records
would
have
been
adequate
probable
cause
to
get
a
warrant
to
use
the
device
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
really
the
question
before
us
is
not
just
procedural,
but
whether
or
not
they
can
use
these
devices
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
if
they
had
enough
probable
cause
to
use
the
device,
they
probably
wouldn't
need
the
device?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
to
what
extent
your
theory
depends
on
the
sophisticated
nature
of
the
equipment?
supposing
the
police
had
rented
the
house
next
door,
and
they
leaned
out
the
second
story
window
with
a
long
pole
with
a
thermometer
on
it,
they
could
kind
of
track
the
wall
and
find
out
what
part
was
hot
and
what
wasn't,
would
that
violate
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
that
be
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
say
the
houses
were
only
six
feet
apart
and
they
could
stay
on
their
side
of
the
boundary
line.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
not
feeling
it.
they
had
to
use
a
thermometer,
and
they
had
to
reach
out
parallel
to
the
walls
of
the
houses
to
do
it.
they're
using
some
kind
of
a
magnifying
equipment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question
about...
would
you
agree
that
katz
would
apply
if
the
imager
would
tell
you
whether
it
was
a
marijuana
operation,
a
hot
shower
or
a
sun
lamp?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
distinction
is
that
katz
would
have
been
decided
differently...
or
there
would
have
been
no
search
in
katz
if
they
just
revealed
the
decibels
of
noise
as
opposed
to
the
specific
conversations,
and
you're
saying
here
they're
revealing
the
quantity
of
heat
without
really
telling
you
what
the
source
of
the
heat
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
distinction
is
based
on
the
particularity
of
what
is
learned
rather
than
the
sophistication
of
the
equipment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
accept
that
rationale,
it
seems
to
me
you
would
decide
katz
differently
if
instead
of
having
the
device
on
the
roof
of
the
phone
booth
they
had
it
six
feet
away.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
a
question.
does
the
record
tell
us
how
extraordinary
the
amount
of
heat
produced
by
these
lamps
and
so
forth
is
as
compared
to
normal
use?
is
it
five
or
six
times
the
amount
or
just
slightly
more?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
don't
tell
us
what...
they
don't
quantify
that,
say
it's
ten
times
as
much
the
normal
use
or
anything
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
expectation
of
privacy,
say
with
sound
if
you
had
a
rock
band
in
the
attic,
you'd
have
lesser
expectation
of
privacy
that
someone
can
hear
it
than
if
you
had
a
soloist
or
something,
and
here
if
you
had
heat
that,
you
know,
really
was
a
tremendous
amount
of
heat
you
might
say
well
you
really
didn't
expect
that
to
be
private,
but
we
don't
measure
it
that
way.
