justice
david
h.
souter
well,
don't
we
have
at
least
a
lodging
here
that
indicates
that
the
thermal
imager
will,
in
fact,
or
can,
in
fact,
produce
images
of
what
is
happening
of
objects
and
what
is
happening
to
those
objects
inside
the
walls?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
what's
the
status
of
the
lodging,
what
are
we
supposed
to
make
of
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
was
the
original
of
that
introduced
in
evidence?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
could
the
judge
make
the
finding
that
he
made
if
he
accepted
the
original
item
of
evidence,
assuming
that
it
is
substantially
identical
to
what
we
have
lodged
with
us,
because
one
of
the
sights
that
appears
from
the
videotape
is
the
sight
of
individuals
moving
inside
a
house,
i
believe
with
the
shades
drawn.
justice
david
h.
souter
was
it
supposedly
taken
in
darkness?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
tell
me,
was
the...
i
looked
at
the
lodged
videotape,
and
it
showed
individuals
moving,
or
an
individual
moving
inside
the
building,
inside
an
apartment.
was
that
image
made
solely
with
the
infrared
process?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
in
total
darkness
of
visible
light--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
image
could
have
been
made
by
the
thermal
imaging
device?
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
you're
saying
we
ought
to
address
it
right
now
because
that
ought
to
be
our
standard
of
what
is
reasonable
expectation.
wasn't
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
you're
saying
some
things
that
take
us
beyond
the
human
senses
are
okay,
eyeglasses,
binoculars,
maybe
not.
but
things
that
are
sort
of
abnormal
in
use
cross
the
line.
why
should
the
line
be
drawn
there?
what's
the...
what's
your
reasoning
behind
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
that
reasonable
expectation
is
in
part
based
on
fact,
what
do
you,
in
fact,
expect,
and
that
informs,
should
inform
the
standard
of
reasonable
expectation,
is
that
the
nub
of
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
you
saying,
in
effect
that
if
thermal
imaging
becomes
very
common
and
every
school
kid
has
a
$5
thermal
imager,
that
at
that
point
it
really
would
be
unreasonable
not
to
expect
that
the
government
was
going
to
use
to
it
figure
out
what's
going
on
in
the
house?
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the
effect
of
sophistication?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
in
my
example,
the
school
kids
have
all
got
thermal
imagers.
does
that
change
the
fourth
amendment
analysis
on
your
theory?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
then
if
that's
the
case,
then
the
criterion
of
sophistication
is
not
sufficient
because
if
that's
the
case,
then
when
thermal
images
are
no
longer
regarded
as
sophisticated,
when
every
kid
has
one,
you
are
saying
we
still
may,
in
fact,
find
that
there
is
a
fourth
amendment
value
that
is
offended
by
admitting
this
stuff
into
evidence.
so
i
think--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you're
getting...
i
think
you're
dropping
your
sophistication
point
as
being
determinative.
it
may
be
helpful
here,
but
if
pushed
you're
saying,
no,
that
is
not
really
what
it
turns
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
does
it
have
anything
to
do
with
the
range
of
normal
and
expected
uses
of
the
device?
what
i'm
thinking
of
is
flashlights
are
used
for
innocent
purposes
all
the
time.
thermal
imagers
i'm
not
so
sure
of.
we
saw
in
the
lodging
that
thermal
images
may
be
used
for
the
totally
benign
purpose
of
deciding
how
well
insulated
a
house
should
be
so
that
people
can
go
around
and
plug
up
leaks,
but
i
suppose
outside
of
the
specialized
use
of
thermal
engineering
in
building
construction
and
design,
i
don't
know
that
thermal
imaging
does
have
much
benign
use,
does
it?
is
it...
in
other
words,
is
its
real
attraction
the
fact
that
it
can,
in
effect,
allow
for
an
inference
about
what
is
going
on
in
a
very
private
place
with
the
exception
of
the
sort
of
the
heat
loss
surveys?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
is
its
only
principal
use
outside
of
heat
loss
surveys,
the
penetration
of
privacy?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
outside
of
that
kind
of
use--
justice
david
h.
souter
--are
there
other
sort
of
benign
uses
that
are
neutral
so
far
as
law
enforcement
might
be
concerned?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
any
case,
that's
not
a
criterion
for
distinguishing
between
thermal
imaging
and
flashlights.
justice
david
h.
souter
but,
you
know,
all
of
that
could
have
been
said
but
for
a
change
of
senses
about
katz.
what
the
bug
in
katz
was
measuring
was
the
effective
sound
on
the
exterior
wall
of
the
phone
booth.
when
people
talk
in
phone
booths,
frequently
people
can
stand
outside
and
hear
what's
going
on
inside,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we've
got
in
this
case
is
a
situation
in
which
we
are
either
going
to
say
katz
is
going
to
be
the
paradigm
on
which
we
decide
this
or
place
is
going
to
be
the
paradigm,
the
dog
sniffing.
isn't
that
our
choice?
because
isn't
everything
you're
saying
something
that
you
could
have
said
but
for
a
change
of
the
sense
organ
in
katz?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
it
was
the
wave
after
it
got
through
the
phone
booth,
just
as
what
infrared
is
picking
up
is
the
wave
after
it
gets
through
the
roof
or
the
window.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the
difference
between
heat
leaving
the
house
and
the
sound
wave
leaving
the
phone
booth?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
so
what?
the
phone
booth
will,
i
suppose,
reverberate
back
the
noise
of
a
truck
going
by.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
reason
they're
doing
the
thermal
imaging
is
not
to
determine
whether
there
is
any
heat
being
left
by
the
sun's
radiation
that
is
reflected
back
in
the
nighttime.
the
whole
point
of
the
imaging
is
to
determine
by
a
high
probability
analysis
what
the
heat
coming
from
the
building
shows
about
its
source
within
the
building,
and
in
that
respect
its
use
is
exactly
the
same
use,
albeit
rather
less
sophisticated,
than
the
use
that
is
being
made
of
the
sound
waves
that
penetrate
through
the
phone
booth
in
katz.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
if
somebody
wants
to
spend
his
time
in
a
house
lying
under
high
electricity
using
sun
lamps,
isn't
that
just
as
much
the
person's
own
business
as
what
he
speaks
in
the
phone
booth?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
doesn't
tell
you
that
because
it
at
this
point
is
not
sophisticated
enough
to
do
it,
but
it
takes
you
one
step
in
the
way.
it
says,
for
example
in
this
case,
yeah,
this
abnormal
electricity
usage
which
is
showing
up
on
the
phone
bill
is
apparently
accounted
for
by
certain
uses,
i
forget
whether
they
were
in
the
attic
or
someplace
like
that,
so
it's
getting
you
one
step
in
the
way
of
figuring
out
exactly
what,
in
fact,
the
use
is
that's
causing
the
electric
bill
to
go
up.
it
just
doesn't
get
you
100
percent
of
the
way
the
way
the
bug
does
in
katz.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
you
have
to
go
through
a
process
of
inference,
which
is
necessary.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
object
is
the
same,
and
the
datum
that
is
being
used
is
the
same.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
well,
that's
the
question.
we
said
in
very
narrow
circumstances
in
place
that
is
true,
and
we
said
in
katz
where
the
inferential
process
is
simpler,
all
you
really
have
to
do
is
listen,
that
it's
not
so,
and
i
think
what
your
argument
boils
down
to
is
if
there
are
more
interim
steps
to
figure
out
what's
really
happening
inside
than
was
necessary
in
katz,
it's
okay,
it's
not
an
invasion
of
privacy,
and
it
doesn't
violate
reasonable
expectation,
but
if
there
are
fewer
steps,
then
maybe
it
does.
is
that
the
nub
of
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
in
that
case
you
wouldn't
want
to
bother
to
use
the
thermal
imager
because
you
can
tell
that
from
the
public
utilities
records.
presumably
the
heat
is
not
staying
in
the
house,
it's
not
a
million
degrees
in
there.
the
heat
is
escaping.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
whole
point
of
using
the
device
is
to
tell
you
something
more
than
you
can
get
from
the
utility
records.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
i'm...
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
don't
you
also
have
to
agree
that
even
on
your
theory,
you
are
one
step
removed
from
the
distinction
that
you
want
to
draw
because
you're
saying
if
the
only
thing
that
katz
revealed
was
the
decibel
level,
that
would
have
involved
no
fourth
amendment
interest,
but
here
something
more
than
what
you
want
to
characterize
as
the
amount
of
heat
or
the
amount
of
heat
loss
is
being
revealed
because
the
image
is
revealing
a
pattern,
it
is
revealing
something
about
the
physical
locations
in
which
the
volume
of
heat
loss
is
occurring
in
a
measurable
way,
so
we're
learning
something
more
than
just
the
equivalent
of
decibel
levels.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
are
saying,
then,
that
the
expectation
of
privacy
depends
on
whether
there
is
this
one
to
one
correlation
between
what
is
picked
up
and
the
ultimate
conclusion
drawn
for
it.
you're
saying,
i
think,
that
if
there
is
a
process
of
inferential
reasoning
in
which
what
is
picked
up
is
only
one
among
other
datum...
data
that
are
used
for
the
reasoning
there
is
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
it's
the
inference
that
breaks
the
expectation...
the
reasonableness
of
the
expectation
of
privacy.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
is
picking
it
up
in
a
way,
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out
earlier
that
clearly
reveals
a
fact
about
what
is
going
on
inside,
and
that
fact
was
not
known
from
utility
records.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
doing
something
more
than
just
confirming
that
there
is
energy
use
going
on.
it
is...
what
it
is
showing
is
that
the
energy
use
is
generating
heat,
and
that
the
heat
is
being
concentrated
in
certain
places
in
the
house.
that's
new
information.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
we
can't
draw
a
conclusion
with
absolute
certainty,
but
if
we
make
the
assumption
that
the
house
has
not
been
whimsically
insulated
so
that
on
the
east
end
of
the
roof
there's
lots
of
insulation
but
when
they
got
to
the
west
end,
they
had
run
out
or
said,
what
the
heck,
let's
let
the
heat
escape.
if
we
don't
make
assumptions
of
whimsy,
we
are,
in
fact,
going
to
be
in
a
position
to
draw
a
probability
inference,
and
that
probability
inference
goes
beyond
anything
that
a
utility
record
could
show.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
then
you're
saying
there
is
no
search
when
an
electronic
device
fails
to
reveal
the
ultimate
conclusion
that
is
being
used
as
evidence.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
would,
too,
but
i
think
that's
your
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
that
gets
back
to
i
think
to
the
point,
that
it's
the
process
of
inference
necessary
to
reach
the
ultimate
conclusion
you
want,
e.g.
marijuana
in
the
house,
that
makes
the
difference
between
a
search
and
a
nonsearch
and
i
guess
makes
the
difference
between
reasonable
expectation
and
nonreasonable
expectation.
justice
david
h.
souter
absolutely
right.
but
the
question
here
is
whether
part
of
that...
whether
that
information
is
acquired
as
a
result
of
a
search
so
that
you
can't
use
that
rationale
to
answer
the
question
in
front
of
us.
