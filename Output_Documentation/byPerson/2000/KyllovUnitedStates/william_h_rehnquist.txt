we'll
hear
argument
now
on
number
99-8508,
danny
lee
kyllo
versus
the
united
states.
mr.
lerner.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
district
court
had
that
before
it
when
it
made
these
findings?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
presumably
to
the
extent
the
findings
are
inconsistent
with
that
exhibit,
the
district
court
did
not
give
full
accord
to
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
think
he
is
answering
my
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
mr.
lerner,
you
say
that
in
this
particular
situation
the
thermal
imaging
did
only
so
much,
but
we
shouldn't
just
look
at
that
we
should
look
at
what
it's
capable
of.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
you're
correct
in
that.
i
think
in
a
fourth
amendment
case
we
decide
what
was
actually
done,
not
what
something
was
capable
of
doing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
a
flashlight
comes
under
the
head
of
something
that's
totally
unexpected?
supposing
the
police
shine
a
flashlight
into
some
people
who
were
hiding
in
a
dark
corner,
is
that
a
search
because
they
had
a
right
to
keep
the
corner
dark?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
suppose
outside
someone's
home.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
would
a
flashlight...
you
mentioned
the
term
flashlight.
how
does
that
fit
into
your
argument?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
is
a
brandeis
opinion
from
the
'20s
that
says
you
can
use
a
bright
light,
i
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
lerner.
mr.
dreeben,
we
will
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
lerner,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lerner.
the
case
is
submitted.
