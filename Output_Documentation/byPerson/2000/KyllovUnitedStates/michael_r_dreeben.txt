mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
thermal
imaging
senses
heat
gradients
on
the
exterior
of
a
surface,
in
this
case
the
structure
was
a
house.
it
does
not
penetrate
the
walls
of
the
house,
it
does
not
reveal
particular
objects
or
activities
inside
of
a
house,
and
the
record
in
this
case
and
the
findings
that
the
district
court
made
indicate
that
it
is
not
capable
of
doing
so
through
walls
of
a
house.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
individuals
have
a
reasonable
and
justifiable
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
heat
that's
on
the
exterior
surface
of
their
walls.
we
believe
that
they
do
not.
heat
loss
is
an
inevitable
feature
of
heat
in
a
structure.
if
a
structure
is
generating
heat,
it
will
lose
that
heat,
and
everyone
knows
that.
that's
why
there
is
an
insulation
industry.
in
addition,
heat
loss
is
frequently
observable
without
the
aid
of
technology,
as,
for
example,
when
snow
melts
on
a
roof.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
souter,
i
think
that
katz
is
fundamentally
different
in
the
respect
that
what
the
bug
picked
up
in
katz
was
sound
waves,
which
is
what
we
hear
with,
and
it
amplified
them
and
exactly
reproduced
what
mr.
katz
was
saying
inside
the
booth.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
think
what
the
infrared
imager
is
picking
up,
and
the
record
in
this
case
again
corroborates
this,
is
heat
leaving
the
house.
now,
there
are
a
number
of
sources--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
there
are
a
number
of
sources
for
the
heat
that
will
leave
the
exterior
of
the
house.
there
is
the
heat
that
it
has
absorbed
during
the
day.
there
is
heat
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
but
what
is
picked
up
and
what
is
discerned
is
the
exact
reproduction
of
the
words
that
the
person
is
speaking,
and
that
is
the
invasion
of
privacy
that
katz
was
concerned
with.
the
whole
point
of
katz
was
not
to
look
at
it
as
a
technological
invasion
or
to
focus
on
whether
the
police
actually
went
inside
the
phone
booth
in
order
to
acquire
that
information.
the
point
was
that
the
information
that
was
acquired
was
from
within
the
booth,
whereas
here
that's
not
the
case
at
all.
what
is
acquired--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
souter,
i
think
that
it's
not
only
considerably
less
sophisticated,
but
it
is
also
picking
up
something
that
is
very
different
in
character
from
the
words
that
people
speak
within
a
particular
place.
that
is
unquestionably
a
private
and
protected
activity,
and
that's
what
the
court
was
focused
on
in
katz.
here
we
are
talking
about
heat
loss,
and
i
think
as
some
of
the
earlier
questions
have
developed,
the
heat
that
is
lost
is
heat
that's
generated
inside
a
structure
by
virtue
of
the
use
of
power.
here
the
police
already
had
utility
records
that
indicated
that
an
abnormal
amount
of
power
was
going
into
the
house,
which
logically
supports
the
inference
that
an
abnormal
amount
of
power
may
well
be
coming
out
of
the
house.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
the
critical
point
here,
justice
souter
is
the
thermal
imager
doesn't
tell
you
that
he's
lying
in
the
house
under
sun--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
doesn't
get
you
in
that
way
in
the
same
mechanism
that
katz
does,
which
is
by
exactly
reproducing
it.
here
you--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--exactly.
and
this
court
has
made
clear
that
law--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
there's
nothing
wrong
with
the
police
attempting
to
use
techniques
from
outside
the
house
that
will
allow
them
to
draw
inferences
about
the
inside
of
the
house.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
the
argument
that
i'm
trying
to
present,
justice
souter,
is
more
complicated
than
that
because
it's
really
focusing
on
the
core
question
of
whether
there
are
reasonable
expectations
of
privacy
in
heat
loss,
and
in
order
to
assess
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--and
what
you're
doing
in
your
bathroom
is
not
picked
up
by
the
thermal
imager.
i
think
it's
very--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--if
you
fog
up
the
windows,
you
could
probably
actually
see
that
from
the
street.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
guess
a
modern
finnish
thermal
imager--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
what
the
record
in
this
case
shows
you
is
that
it
might
be
able
to
pick
up
exterior
heat
on
the
outside
of
the
house,
and
it
will
not
tell
you
what's
going
on
inside
the
house.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
do
but
i
think
what
it
overlooks
is
that
the
record
in
this
case,
the
video
in
this
case
is
particularly
instructive.
it
is
lodged
with
the
court,
and
it
represents
what
is
alleged
to
be
a
search
here.
it
shows
nothing
of
the
kind.
contrary
to
petitioner's
suggestion
that
it
showed
three
evenly
spaced
heat
spots
that
could
only
be
the
signature
of
a
heat
lamp,
it
doesn't
show
that,
and
nobody
testified
that
that
was
the
inference
that
was
drawn.
all
that
was
drawn
was
an
inference
that
there
is
an
anomalous
heat
loss
from
this
house
compared
to
the
structures
nearby,
and
from
that
piece
of
information
you
could
learn
absolutely
nothing
about
what
is
going
on
inside
the
house.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
thermal--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
whole
point
of
using
the
device
to
try
to
cross
corroborate
various
pieces
of
information
so
that
you
can
better
establish
probable
cause
for
the
search
warrant
that
was
ultimately
obtained.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
most
of
those
activities
probably
will
make
heat,
justice
scalia,
but
the
thermal
imager--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
actually
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
realize
that...
the
point
that
you're
making
but
i
actually
think
that
the
physics
of
it
are
that
if
you
use
more
electricity,
probably
a
lot
of
it
will
end
up
as
heat,
but
the
point
that
the
thermal
imager
gives
you
is
real
time
information,
that
there
actually
is
what
appears
to
be
anomalous
heat
that
is
coming
out
of
this
house
compared
to
its
neighbors.
neither
the
imager
nor
the
utility
bills
will
tell
you
there
is
probably
a
marijuana
growing
operation
inside
this
house.
it
will
not
tell
you
that
there's
a
sauna,
it
will
not
tell
you
that
there's
a
bath
or
a
dehumidifier
or
anything
else.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
would,
justice
stevens,
if
what
it
is
doing
is,
in
effect,
revealing
the
activities
that
are
inside
the
house,
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
katz
may
well
have
come
out
differently
if
what
was
being
learned
was
nothing
more
than
you
could
actually
see
through
the
booth,
which
is
that
somebody
was
using
the
booth.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right,
and
i
want
to--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--we're
very
clear
about
this
for
justice
souter
and
justice
breyer's
questions,
if
the
thermal
imager
functioned
like
an
x
ray
machine
or
if
it
functioned
to
be
able
to
reach
inside
the
house
and
pull
out
the
sounds
and
listen
to
what
was
going
on,
then
we
don't
dispute
that
it
would
be
a
search.
under
katz
it
clearly
would
be
a
search
if
what
it
does
is
reveal
the
activities
that
are
going
on
inside
the
house
or
things
that
are
inside
the
house.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
what
we're
not
learning
is
what
activities
are
going
on
or
where
they
are
going
on
in
the
house.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
you
do
learn
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
at
that
level
of
generality,
coupled
with
inferences
because
you
don't
learn
that
directly
from
the
imager
at
all,
you
don't
learn
directly
from
the
imager
at
all
that
unusual
amounts
of
heat
are
being
generated.
you
have
to
couple
that
with
inferences
about
what
other
houses
next
door
might
be
doing,
and
you
probably
don't
know
what's
going
on
inside
of
those
houses,
and
you
have
to
couple
it
with
inferences
that
it
hasn't
been
unduly
heated
up
by
the
sun
or
that
there's
not
a
local
microclimate
that
is
causing
the
imager
to
pick
up
additional
radiated
heat
at
that
location.
you
have
to
factor
in
all
of
those
things,
which
reduces
the
specificity
and
directness,
the
linearality
of
any
inference
that
you
draw.
there
isn't
a
one
to
one
correspondence
between
heat
on
the
exterior
of
the
structure
and
heat
on
the
interior
of
the
structure.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
it's
several
factors,
justice
souter.
that
is
one
of
the
factors.
the
factor
that
you're
relying
on
inferences
to
conclude
that
there
probably
is
a
heat
generating
source
inside
the
house
that
is
greater
than
average.
another
factor
is
that
heat
loss
is
not
that
private
a
fact,
as
it
corresponds
roughly
to
consumption
of
energy,
which
is
not
private.
and
a
third
factor
is
that
the
imager
is
not
picking
up,
again,
activities
that
are
inside
the
house
directly.
it
is
picking
up
the
exterior
surface
of
the
walls.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
complements
the
utility
records.
i
do
think
that
if
the
government--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it's
not
showing
that
justice
souter,
because
we
don't
know
the
composition
of
the
insulation
within
the
house,
we
don't
know
the
configuration--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
ultimate
inference
that
we
would
like
to
draw,
of
course,
does
but
the
question
is
whether
the
data
that
we
are
collecting
from
which
we
draw
that
inference
constitutes
a
search.
the
steps
of
inference
that
we
use
once
we
have
acquired
the
data
cannot
make
a
description--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
would
hesitate
to
say
categorically
that
that
is
so,
but
i
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
my
argument
in
this
case
depends
on
the
nature
of
heat,
what
the
imager
actually
detects,
and
the
fact
that
we
need
to
draw
a
series
of
inferences.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
there
are
several
critical
differences,
justice
kennedy.
the
first
is
that
heat
loss
is
inevitable
from
a
structure.
everybody
knows
that.
that's
why
there's
an
insulation
industry
in
the
first
place.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
most
people
talk,
and
when
they
talk
within
the
four
walls
of
their
house,
unless
they
have
the
windows
open
and
they're
screaming
out
the
window,
will
make
an
assumption
that
they
cannot
be
heard
by
people
who
are
standing
on
the
street.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
in
addition,
the
fact
that
heat
is
generated
in
a
structure
is
largely
a
product
of
the
power
that's
going
into
the
structure,
the
electrical
and
other
utilities
that
are
brought
into
the
structure,
and
there's
no
secret
about
that
information
because
it
comes
from
the
utility
company.
third
factor
is
that
heat
loss
itself
is
observable
in
a
variety
of
circumstances
without
the
aid
of
any
technology
whatsoever.
in
the
examples
of
when
snow
is
melting
on
a
house
or
when,
for
example,
smoke
is
going
up
a
chimney.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
don't
think
that
it's
neutral.
i
think
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
there's
a
fairly
significant
difference
between
cases
where
the
court
has
said
somebody
has
publicly
exposed
their
activities
to
view
and
therefore
doesn't
have
any
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
and
the
very
question
of
whether
heat
loss
is
a
private
enough
fact
in
the
first
place.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think
that's--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
don't
think
it's
the
strongest
analogy,
although
there
are
cases
where
i
think
the
analogy
would
fit.
the
theory
of
the
garbage
cases
is
that
by
voluntarily
abandoning--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
that
there
are
cases
in
which
the
analogy
would
fit
better;
for
example,
where
there
is
a
very
active
ventilation
system
that
is
specifically
attempting
to
draw
the
heat
out
of
the
house
in
order
to
provide
a
suitable
climate
for
growing
the
plants
that
are
inside,
but
the
primary
rationale
that
the
ninth
circuit
used
which
is
similar
to
the
rationale
that
i'm
articulating
here
is
that
the
thermal
imager
doesn't
pick
up
any
intimate
details
or
particularly
private
details
about
what
is
going
on
inside
of
the
house.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
absolutely
correct,
and
i
do
think
that
that
illustrates--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
whole
point
of
katz,
justice
stevens,
was
that
that
physical
intrusion
is
irrelevant.
what
matters
is
what
information
you
were
acquiring,
and
in
katz,
and
in
the
hypothetical
of
removing
the
bug
from
six
feet,
the
information
that
you
are
acquiring
is
direct
information
from
inside
the
house.
in
the
thermal
imager
it's
not.
it's
a
fusion
of
heat
from
a
variety
of
sources.
it's
a
very
weak
correlation
between
what's
going
on
outside
the
house
and
what's
going
on
inside
the
house.
it's
not
like
seeing
a
visual
heat
impression
of
a
particular
object
that's
outlined
as
if
it
were
in
silhouette
on
the
outside
of
the
house.
nothing
of
the
kind
occurs.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
certainly
if
what
you
are
acquiring
is
information
that
is
not
itself
the
product
of
a
search,
as
in
justice
scalia's
hypothetical,
the
fact
that
you
can
draw
inferences,
including
very
detailed
and
intimate
inferences
about
the
inside
of
a
the
house
doesn't
convert
the
original
observation
into
a
search.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
that
the
opposite
is
actually
what
holds
true.
you
cannot
use
the
fact
that
inferences
can
be
drawn
from
the
observations
to
categorize
the
observations
as
a
search.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
but
my
seventh
grade
science
classes
don't
help
me
very
much
with
this,
either,
and
i
think
what
the
court's
cases
indicate
is
that
it's
not
essentially
a
science
question.
it's
a
question
about,
as
the
latter
part
of
your
comment
indicated,
the
reasonable
expectations
that
people
have,
and
i
think
people
have
different
expectations
about
what
is
outside
of
their
house
from
what
is
inside
of
their
house,
and
there
are
a
variety
of
ways--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--probably
very
little,
although
so
far
there
has
been
some
commercialization
of
thermal
imaging
in
cars
that
will
help
it
detect
animals
in
the
road
and
so
forth,
and
there
probably
will
be
other
uses
in
the
future.
i
don't
think
that
this
case
turns
on
whether
thermal
imaging
is
so
prevalently
in
use
that
everybody
would
expect
it
would
be
used
on
their
house.
i
think
the
core
question
is
whether
the
heat
loss
on
the
outside
of
their
house
is
sufficiently
revealing
of
what's
inside
of
the
house
to
be
considered
a
search.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
but
the
california
versus
greenwood
analysis
is
not
the
only
analysis
that
could
be
used
for
expectations
of
privacy.
the
court
was
clear
in
that
case
that
the
people
could
expect
that
their
garbage
would
be
rummaged
through
once
they
put
it
outside
and
therefore
couldn't
expect
that
the
police
would
not
do
that,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
people
do
intrinsically
have
an
expectation
of
privacy
that
their
houses
are
losing
heat.
most
people
do
not
go
around
thinking
about
that
as
something
that
they
view
as
a
particularly
private
fact.
they
ventilate
heat,
they
try
to
put
insulation
in
to
keep
it
from
leaving
the
house,
and
they
buy
electricity
and
other
sources
of
power
that
are
going
to
generate
it.
what
they
do
expect
is
that
they
will
not
be
able
to
be
viewed
engaging
in
their
personal
activities
or
listened
to
in
the
house.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
different
case,
justice
ginsburg,
because
then
it
would
begin
to
approach
an
x
ray
device
or
some
other
device
that
could
actually
penetrate
the
barriers
of
the
walls,
and
there
the
expectations
that
would
be
intruded
upon
would
not
be
simply
heat
leaving
the
house
but
would
be
the
very
detailed
activities
that
go
on
inside
of
the
house.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
there's
information
in
the
search
warrant
that
tends
to
show
that
they
produce...
that
they
consume
an
inordinate
amount
of
electricity,
and
there
is
testimony
that
the
halide
lights
that
are
used
for
growing
marijuana
generate
a
high
amount
of
heat.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
recall
whether
there's
a
direct--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
thermal
imager
doesn't
really
measure
it
that
way,
either.
all
it
detects
is
relative
amounts
of
heat.
it
doesn't
detect
absolute
amounts
of
heat,
and
accordingly,
officers
tried
to
use
a
reference
structure.
now,
they're
going
to
have
to
draw
a
lot
of
inferences
by
comparing
one
structure
to
another
because
it's
not
a
perfect
control.
they
don't
really
know
what's
going
on
inside
the
house
next
door,
and
even
the
inference
that
there's
an
anomalous
amount
of
heat
that's
going
on
in
878
rhododendron
drive,
which
is
what
the
thermal
imager
produced
in
this
case,
is
an
inference
that
depends
on
things
that
the
officers
don't
really
know,
that
what
is
going
on
in
the
house
next
door
that
makes
it
look
cooler
compared
to
the
house
that
they're
actually
surveying,
and
all
of
those
factors
contribute
to
make
the
data
that
is
obtained
in
this
case
qualitatively
different
than
the
data
that
would
be
obtained
in
a
wiretap
case
or
in
a
case
where
an
x
ray
type
device
actually
penetrated
the
house.
now,
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
thermal
imaging
is
a
search,
it
could
have
a
very
chilling
effect
on
uses
of
the
thermal
imager
other
than
the
kind
of
use
that
it
was
put
to
in
this
case.
thermal
imagers
are
often
used
in
fugitive
apprehension,
in
perimeter
surveillance
for
law
enforcement,
and
for
search
and
rescue
operations
in
which
they
pick
up
an
enormous
amount
of
data,
including
houses
that
may
be
nearby
to
where
a
fugitive
or
a
missing
person
is
located.
and
if
the
court
concludes
that...
thank
you.
