but
if
we
did,
if
we
had
such
a
case
under
your
view,
we'd
have
to
ask
what
potentially
they
could
see,
and
getting
back
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
i
just
don't
know
if
there's
authority
for
that.
suppose
we
had
a
case
and
we
stipulate
that
it's
lawful
for
the
police
to
listen
with
an
electronic,
enhanced
listening
device
to
a
conversation
that
takes
place
on
the
street,
let's
assume
that's
lawful.
we
would
judge
that
under
its
own
terms.
we
wouldn't
say,
oh,
well,
now,
this
could
potentially
have
been...
had
its
listening
power
turned
up
so
it
could
hear
what
was
going
on
inside.
we
don't
decide
cases
that
way,
do
we?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
on
that
point,
it
seems
to
me
you
take
somewhat
inconsistent
positions.
on
the
one
hand
you
said
this
could
pinpoint
with
great
accuracy
what
happens,
and
then
in
the
next
couple
pages
you
say,
well,
now,
these
images
can
be
manipulated
by
the
police.
i
mean,
which
is
it?
is
this
thing
accurate
or
not
accurate?
those
seem
to
me
like
inconsistent--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
my
point
is,
you
do
make
this
argument
to
us.
you
say,
number
one,
it's
an
unacceptable
invasion
of
privacy
because
it's
so
accurate.
then
number
two
you
say,
well
this
is
very
dangerous
because
it
can
be
manipulated,
it's
so
vague.
it
seems
to
me
those
are
inconsistent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
certainly
not
what
the
prosecuting
attorney
told
the
magistrate.
he
didn't
say,
now,
we
can't
draw
any
inferences
from
this.
that's
the
whole
point
of
getting
the
warrant.
let
me
ask
you
this.
there's
an
element
of
circularity
necessarily
in
our
opinions
as
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
because
the
courts
say
so,
and
in
katz
there
was
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
because
this
court
made
the
assumption,
the
finding,
the
inference,
the
conclusion
that
we
don't
want
our
private
conversations
intercepted
when
we
are
in
a
space
which
we
think
is
private.
what
is
different
about
the
conversation,
the
contents
of
discussions
on
one
hand
and
heat
generating
activities
on
the
other?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
most
people
talk,
too,
so--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
think
that's
somewhat
of
an
issue.
what
other
reasons?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
same
for
conversation.
if
i
happen
to
be
going
by
a
window
that's
open,
i
can
hear
the
conversation.
if
i...
so
that's
also,
it
seems
to
me,
neutral.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean...
or
neutral
as
a
way
of
distinguishing
the
two
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
you
see,
that
distinguishes
it
from
the
garbage
case,
greenwood,
and
as
i
recall,
the
word
abandonment
was
not
used
in
greenwood.
i
looked
at
it
just
quickly.
abandonment
was
a
theory
the
court
stayed
way
away
from.
the
court
said
there's
no
objective
expectation
of
privacy
because
we
all
put
our
garbage
out
and
we
all
take
this
risk.
but
that
just
doesn't
fit
with
what
we
have
before
us
today
based
on
the
conversation
and
the
exchange
you
were
just
having
with
justice
breyer.
we
just
don't
know
about
these
things.
most
people
don't
know
that
their
heat's
going
to
escape
and
be
measured.
