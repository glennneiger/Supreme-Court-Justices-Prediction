mr.
lerner,
i
thought
the
district
court
here
made
some
findings
in
that
regard.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
the
effect
that
the
thermal
imaging
device
cannot
and
did
not
show
any
people
or
activity
within
the
walls
of
the
structure,
and
the
device
cannot
penetrate
walls
or
windows
to
reveal
conversations
or
human
activities.
it
recorded
only
the
heat
being
emitted
from
the
home.
now,
i
guess
you
accept
those
findings,
do
you
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
do
we,
reviewing
the
judgment
here,
have
to
accept
those
findings
as
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
have
we
upheld,
for
example,
the
use
of
night
vision
glasses
by
law
enforcement
personnel
to
see
things
that
they
couldn't
see
with
natural
vision--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--we've
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
other
courts
have?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--how
about--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
a
dog
sniff,
how
about
a
dog
sniff?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
we've
used
dog
sniffs
to
detect
something
that
the
human
nose
doesn't
detect,
haven't
we?
so
under
your
test
that's
out,
too,
but
we've
upheld
some
of
those.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
dreeben,
the
ninth
circuit
seemed
to
rely
on
a
theory
of
it's
like
garbage
thrown
out,
that
when
the
homeowner
has
waste
heat,
it's
somehow
discarded,
and
there's
no
privacy
interest
left
in
it.
do
you
support
that
analogy?
i
thought--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
was
a
little
hard
to
understand.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
abandonment.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
hard
to
say
the
homeowner
had
abandoned
this
heat
information.
