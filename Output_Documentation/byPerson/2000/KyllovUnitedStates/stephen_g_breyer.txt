justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
could
it
vary?
how
fixed
is
that
in
the
precedents?
i
mean,
could
you
have
enough
cause
to
warrant
a
beeper...
warrant
a
thermal
imager,
which
is
far
less
intrusive
than
going
into
the
house?
or
do
you
think
it's
absolutely
fixed
that
you
either
have
probable
cause
to
rummage
through
the
bedroom
or
you
can't
do
anything?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
your
choice
was
exactly
that,
that
you...
when
faced
with
that
dilemma,
the
court
holds
that
you
can
use
it
without
any
warrant,
and
how
would
you
prefer
as
a
fallback,
you
need
at
least
a
warrant
but
less
cause
than
to
rummage
in
the
home
itself
or
is
that
so
fixed
in
the
law
there
is
really
just
the
absolute
dichotomy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
know
that,
and
what
you'd
have
to
say
is
it's
probable
cause
not
to
enter
the
home.
it's
probable
cause
to
get
an
imager.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
a
drug
sniffing
dog
you
couldn't?
i
mean,
if
you
brought
the
drug
sniffing
dog
up
to
the
window
and
it
has
a
fit?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
your
view,
you
couldn't
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
i
mean,
people
would
at
that
world,
which
is
an
odd
world,
all
the
time
be
expecting
everybody
under
the
sun
to
know
whether
they
are
taking
baths
or
not.
well,
if
you
expect
everybody
under
the
sun
to
do
it,
you
don't
have
an
expectation
of
privacy,
just
as
is
the
case
with
binoculars.
so
why
doesn't
that
make
the
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
yeah,
but
you
don't
expect--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--your
phone
to
be
wiretapped.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
do
expect
people
to
walk
around
with
binoculars.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
doesn't
that
make
the
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
isn't
there
another
difference
other
than
what
the
court
said?
we
don't
expect
everybody
in
the
sun
to
be...
under
the
sun...
to
be
tapping
our
phones.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
do
expect
quite
often
people
to
walk
around
with
binoculars.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
in
heat
loss.
it's
in
what
is
going
on
in
the
house,
and
i
suppose
it's
a
question
of
what's
going
on
in
the
house,
and
do
you
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
do
you
have
a
reasonable
expectation
that
the
kind
of
thing
you're
doing
in
the
house
will
not
be
picked
up
by
somebody
out
of
the
house,
not
a
law
enforcement
officer,
but
just
ordinary
people.
where
you're
walking
in
front
of
a
window,
the
answer
is
no.
where
you're
walking
in
front
of
the
window
and
people
pick
it
up
with
binoculars,
every
bird
watcher
has
a
binocular.
where
they're
picking
it
up
with
flashlights,
every
boy
scout
has
a
flashlight.
who
has
a
heat
thermal
device?
nobody,
except
a
few.
so
there's
no...
there
is
a
reasonable...
that's
the
argument,
i
think
that
there
is
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
that
what
you're
doing
in
your
bathroom
is
not
going
to
be
picked
up
when
you
take
a
bath
by
somebody
with
one
of
these
not
very
well
working
machines.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
couldn't
tell,
for
example...
i
thought
the
thermal
imager
could
tell
if
i
go
into
the
bathroom...
i
happen
to
like
a
sauna,
and
i
turn
on
every
shower,
and
i
have...
it
really
is
hot
and
steamy,
and
there
we
are.
you're
saying
it
can't
pick
that
up?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
i
don't
have
any
windows.
they're
just
these
very
modern
finnish
wood.
now,
do
you
tell
me
they
can't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--can
it
pick
it
up
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it'll
just
tell
you
it's
hot
in
there,
which
happens
to
be
just
the
thing
they
want
to
know.
they
want
to
know
if
it's
hot
or
if
it's
cold.
and
i
suppose
that
there
are
instances
where
i
would
prefer
people
not
know
that.
i
usually
spend
three
or
four
hours
a
day
in
my
finnish
sauna.
people
think
i'm
working.
i
don't
want
them
to
find
out
what's
going
on.
so
do
you
see
the
point?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right.
that's
exactly
right.
but
justice
scalia
had
an
inference,
had
a
situation
where
you
use
your
eyes
and
your
brain.
nothing
against
that.
here
they
are
using
a
machine.
you
keep
telling
me
that
what's
inside
the
house
isn't
that
important,
it's
very
vague
and
general.
what
is
the
nature
of
the
information
to
do
with
it?
i
would
have
thought
nothing.
if
somebody's
inside
the
house
singing
maresy
dotes,
doesy
dotes,
who
cares
what
he's
singing?
the
fact
is
where
he
was
singing
it,
and
he
was
singing
it
inside
his
house.
so
you're
taking
information
from
inside
the
house.
maybe
our
problem
is
my
seventh
grade
science
class.
i
mean,
i
used
to
think,
perhaps
wrongly,
that
sound
went
to
a
wall,
then
the
electrons
start
to
vibrate
in
the
wall,
and
pretty
soon
the
wave
goes
outside,
and
here
it
seems
to
me
heat
goes
to
the
wall,
heats
up
the
wall,
and
then
the
heat
goes
outside,
so
i
just
find
it
difficult
to
distinguish
between
sound
and
heat,
but
i
find
it
easy
to
distinguish
in
terms
of
whether
a
person
inside
the
house
has
a
reasonable
expectation
that
a
lot
of
people
outside
the
house
are
going
to
be
using
this
machine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
good,
that's
exactly
it.
what
is
it
that
would
lead
me
reasonably
to
expect
a
lot
of
these
machines
around
picking
up
the
heat?
