justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
about
the
proposition
that
so
long
as
it
is
not
showing
anything
that
couldn't
have
been
discovered
without
the
visual
imager,
in
this
case
when
you're
talking
about
how
warm
the
roof
is,
i
assume
that
if
the
police
had
waited
for
a
good
snowfall,
they
could
have
found
out
exactly
what
they
found
out
through
this
thermal
imaging.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
snow
would
have
melted
on
other
roofs,
it
would
not
have
melted...
i
mean,
it
would
have
melted
in
these
portions,
it
wouldn't
have
melted
elsewhere.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
didn't
matter
it
came
from
a
particular
place.
i
mean,
what
was
the
significant
information
that
the
police
derived
was
that
there
was
an
extraordinary
amount
of
heat
being
generated
in
this
house,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
would
it
have
mattered
whether
it
was
in
the
cellar
or
in
the
roof?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
it
seems
to
me,
would
it
have
been
a
violation
for
the
police...
i
think
they
did
use
in
the
search
warrant
here
the
fact
that
the
utility
bills
for
this
home
were
much
higher
than
surrounding
homes.
is
that
a
violation
of
the
privacy
of
the
home,
the
police
finding
out
that
these
people
are
using
an
extraordinary
amount
of
electricity?
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
go
in
the
house
and
look.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lerner--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
say
that
you
can't
use...
look
into
the
home
with
anything
other
than
the
unaided
senses.
is
it
unconstitutional
to
use
binoculars
to
look
into
a
window
that's
left
unclosed
without
a
curtain?
is
that
what
our
case
law
says?
i
don't
think
it
does--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
eyeglasses
are
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
but
not
binoculars?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
should--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
is
that
relevant?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
about
a
policeman
with
10/10
vision,
is
that
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
i
guess
that's
better
than
20/20,
i
don't
know.
i'm
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
your
reasonable
expectations
of
privacy
include
technology?
why
don't
your
reasonable
expectations
include
the
fact
that
you
know
there
are
such
things
as
binoculars,
so
that
even
if
your
house
is
a
long
distance
away
from
where
anybody
else
can
stand,
you
pull
your
curtains
if
you
want
privacy
because
you
know
people
have
binoculars?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so
also
you
know
there
are
things
such
as
thermal
image,
and
so
if
you're
really
concerned
about
that
degree
of
privacy,
i'm
sure
there
are
means
of
preventing
the
heat
escape
from
the
house,
and
therefore
preventing
that
technology
from
being
used.
why
do
we
have
to
assume
that
we
live
in
a
world
without
technology?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
it
does
and
we
have
the
ability
to
protect
our
private
lives
as
well
if
we
really
have
expectations
of
privacy.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
can't
shine
it
into
the
window
of
a
house?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
you
can't?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
no...
what
do
you
mean,
it
would
depend
on
the
vantage...
a
policeman
sees
an
open
window,
he
suspects
that
this
house
has
contraband
in
it,
the
window
is
left
uncurtained,
he
shines
a
flashlight
inside
and
sees
stolen
goods.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
utility
records
wouldn't
tell
you
what
the
electricity
was
being
used
for,
as
somebody
suggested
earlier.
he
could
have
been
doing
laundry
or
listening
to
rock
records
at
that
high
volume
or
a
million
other
things
other
than
making
heat.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
missed
my
point.
my
point
is
that
all
of
those
activities
consume
electricity,
so
the
electricity
bills
do
not
establish
that
an
unusual
amount
of
heat
is
being
generated
in
this
house.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
what
is
needed
to
grow
marijuana,
i
gather.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
how
you
define
activities.
you
certainly
learn
that
the
generation
of
heat
is
going
on
in
the
house.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
a
lot
of
heat
generating
going
on
in
that
house.
now,
if
i,
you
know,
if
i
happen
to
be
quite
a
private
person
and
i
don't
want
people
knowing
how
much
heat
i'm
generating,
i
suppose
that
that
activity
has,
indeed,
been
disclosed
to
the
world.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
what
about
a
more
general
proposition,
that
there
is
no
unconstitutional
invasion
of
privacy
when
the
police
deduce
from
what
goes
on
outside
the
house
what
is
going
on
inside
the
house,
intimate
or
not.
i
suppose
the
police
can
certainly
surveil
a
house
over
a
long
period
and
see
people
carrying
in
hot
dogs
every
day,
and
they
can
deduce
that
the
eating
of
hot
dogs
is
going
on
in
that
house.
and
that
is
surely
no
violation
of
the
constitution,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
law
enforcement
officers
suspected
that
marijuana
was
being
grown
in
a
house
belonging
to
petitioner
danny
kyllo.
indoor
marijuana
growth
typically
requires
high-intensity
lamps
that
generate
considerable
heat.
to
detect
the
relative
heat
of
kyllo's
home,
officers
used
a
thermal
imager
to
scan
the
home
in
the
middle
of
the
night.
thermal
imagers
convert
infrared
radiation
into
images,
essentially
showing
heat
images
like
a
video
camera.
the
scan
of
kyllo's
home
showed
that
the
roof
over
the
garage
and
the
side
wall
were
relatively
warm
compared
to
adjoining
roofs.
based
on
the
thermal
imaging
and
other
evidences,
a
federal
magistrate
judge
issued
a
warrant
authorizing
a
search
of
petitioner’s
home
and
the
agents
found
an
indoor
marijuana
growing
operation.
petitioner
unsuccessfully
moved
to
suppress
the
evidence
seized
from
the
house
as
the
product
of
an
unlawful
search.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
remanded
the
case
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
regarding
the
intrusiveness
of
the
thermal
imaging.
on
remand,
the
district
court
reaffirmed
its
denial
of
the
motion
to
suppress.
a
divided
court
of
appeals
affirmed
holding
that
the
thermal
imaging
was
not
a
search
because
it
did
not
expose
any
intimate
details
of
kyllo’s
life.
we
reverse.
with
few
exceptions,
the
question
whether
a
warantless
search
of
a
home
is
reasonable
and
hence
constitutional
must
be
answered
no.
on
the
other
hand,
whether
or
not
a
fourth
amendment
search
has
occurred,
is
not
so
simple
under
our
precedent.
the
fourth
amendment
protection
of
the
home
has
never
been
thought
to
require
law
enforcement
officers
to
shield
their
eyes
when
passing
by
a
home
on
public
thoroughfares.
the
reason
for
that
used
to
be
that
there
was
no
search
unless
there
was
a
trespass
and
the
eyes
could
not
be
guilty
of
that
common
law
tort.
in
the
last
century
however,
we
decoupled
violation
of
a
person’s
fourth
amendment
rights
from
trespassory
violation
of
his
property.
the
criteria
in
the
fourth
amendment
violation
now
is
embodied
in
the
principle
first
enunciated
in
case
called
katz
versus
united
states,
which
held
unconstitutional,
the
place
overhearing
of
a
phone
conversation
inside
a
public
phone
booth
achieved
by
attaching
a
listening
device
to
the
exterior
of
the
booth.
as
justice
harlan’s
concurrence
in
that
case
described
it,
a
fourth
amendment
search
occurs
when
the
government
violates
a
subjective
expectation
of
privacy
that
society
recognizes
as
reasonable.
the
katz
test
has
often
been
criticized
as
circular
and
hence
subjective
and
unpredictable.
while
it
maybe
difficult
to
refine
katz
when
the
search
of
areas
such
as
telephone
booths,
automobiles
or
even
the
curtilage
and
uncovered
portions
of
residences
are
at
issue.
in
the
case
of
the
search
of
the
interior
of
homes
there
is
a
ready
criterion
with
roots
deep
in
the
common
law
of
that
minimal
expectation
of
privacy
which
exists,
and
which
is
acknowledged
to
be
reasonable.
we
think
that
obtaining
by
sense-enhancing
technology,
any
information
regarding
the
interior
of
the
home
that
could
not
otherwise
have
been
obtained
without
physical
intrusion
into
a
constitutionally
protected
area,
constitutes
a
search,
at
least
whereas
here,
the
technology
in
question
is
not
in
general
public
use.
on
the
basis
of
this
criterion,
the
information
obtained
by
the
thermal
imager
in
this
case
was
the
product
of
a
search.
the
government
maintains
that
the
thermal
imaging
must
be
upheld
because
it
detected
only
heat
radiating
from
the
external
surface
of
the
house.
we
rejected
such
a
mechanical
interpretation
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
katz,
where
the
eavesdropping
device
picked
up
only
sound
waves
that
reached
the
exterior
of
the
phone
booth.
reversing
that
approach
would
leave
the
homeowner
at
the
mercy
of
advancing
technology,
including
imaging
technology
that
could
discern
all
human
activity
in
the
home.
we
also
reject
the
government’s
contention
that
the
thermal
imaging
was
constitutional
because
it
did
not
detect
private
activities
occurring
in
private
areas.
the
fourth
amendment
protection
of
the
home
has
never
been
tied
to
measurement
of
the
quality
or
the
quantity
of
information
obtained.
everything
going
on
in
the
home
is
intimate
as
far
as
the
fourth
amendment
is
concerned.
moreover
limiting
the
probation
of
thermal
imaging
to
intimate
details
would
be
impractical
in
application.
since
there
is
no
necessary
connection
between
the
sophistication
of
the
surveillance
equipment
and
the
intimacy
of
the
details
that
it
happens
to
observe.
the
relatively
crude
agema
thermovision
210,
which
was
the
imager
used
in
the
present
case,
might
disclose,
for
example,
at
what
hour
each
night
the
lady
of
the
house
takes
her
daily
sauna
and
bath,
a
detail
that
many
would
consider
intimate
and
a
much
more
sophisticated
system
might
detect
nothing
more
intimate
than
the
fact
that
somebody
left
the
closet
light
on.
we
could
not,
in
other
words,
develop
a
rule
approving
only
that
through-the-wall
surveillance
which
identifies
objects,
no
smaller
that
36x36
inches,
but
we
would
have
to
develop
a
jurisprudence
specifying
which
home
activities
are
intimate
and
which
are
not,
and
even
when
if
ever
that
jurisprudence
were
fully
developed,
no
police
officer
would
be
able
to
know
in
advance
whether
his
through-the-wall
surveillance
picks
up
intimate
details,
and
thus
would
be
unable
to
know
in
advance
whether
it
is
constitutional.
the
fourth
amendment
draws
a
firm
line
at
the
entrance
to
the
home.
that
line
we
think
must
be
not
only
firmed,
but
also
bright,
which
requires
clear
specification
of
those
methods
of
surveillance
that
require
a
warrant.
whereas
here,
the
government
uses
a
device
that
is
not
in
general
public
use
to
explore
details
of
the
home
that
would
previously
have
been
unknowable
without
physical
intrusion.
the
surveillance
is
a
search
and
is
presumptively
unreasonable
without
a
warrant.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
o'connor
and
justice
kennedy
have
joined.
