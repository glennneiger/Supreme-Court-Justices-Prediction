mr.
lerner,
would
you
qualify--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
sorry.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now
may
i
qualify
that
what
you're
talking
about
now,
the
one
that
shows
people,
was
not
the
one
that
was
involved
in
this
very
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
a
different
one?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
i
think
there
is
some
confusion
on
that
point.
the
one
in
this
case
didn't
show
any
people
or
didn't
show
any--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
would
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
lerner,
could
you
just
explain
to
me
what
this
thermal
imaging
revealed
that
was
not
revealed
by
the
utility
records
which
you
say
under
our
precedent
it
was
permissible
for
the
police
to
obtain?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
lerner,
you
were
explaining
to
me,
and
i
haven't
quite
grasped
it,
why
the
utility
records
wouldn't
tell
you
the
same
thing.
will
the
thermal
imaging
tell
you
that
it's
not
women
taking
showers?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
imaging
will
tell
you
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
the
device
became
more
sophisticated
and
the
police
could
say,
well,
it's
not
just
heat
in
general,
we
can
tell
that
it's
a
lamp
or
a
shower,
would
that
be
a
different
case?
