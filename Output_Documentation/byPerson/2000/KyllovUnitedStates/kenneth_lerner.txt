mr.
kenneth
lerner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
about
thermal
imaging
of
a
home
without
a
warrant,
and
whether
that
constitutes
an
impermissible
search
under
the
fourth
amendment.
our
home
is
the
basic
refuge
for
all
citizens.
it's
where
we
have
our
greatest
expectations
of
privacy,
where
we
are
free
to
let
down
our
guard,
and
where
we
should
have
our
greatest
feeling
that
we
are
free
from
government
spying.
unreasonable
and
unwarranted
searching
of
the
home
is
the
chief
evil
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
us
against,
and
it
has
a
specific...
the
home
itself
has
a
specific
mention
in
the
constitution,
and
as
a
bedrock
principle,
the
home
is
a
place
where
we
have
our
most
heightened
expectations
of
privacy.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
yes.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
well,
i
accept
the
finding,
your
honor,
that
the
thermal
imager
is
capturing
emissions
as
they
are
coming
from
the
wall.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
well,
i
think
some
of
those
findings
are
mixed
questions
of
fact
and
law,
such
as
what
is
activity
and
what
activity
does
the
constitution
protect.
i
don't
think
those
are
findings
that
the
court
has
to
accept,
but
i
am
perfectly
comfortable
with
the
finding
that
the
thermal
imager
was
capturing
the
information
on
the
outside
of
the
home.
however,
i
think
that
is
an
incomplete
view
of
thermal
imaging
because
there
would
be
no
image
at
all
if
it
weren't
for
the
thermodynamic
process.
there
must
be
a
constant
heat
source
to
heat
up
the
wall
so
that
you
will
see
it.
therefore
there
is
something
behind
the
wall
that
provides
and
radiates
heat
to
the
wall,
the
wall
reradiates
it
out,
but
if
it's
not
constant,
if
it's
not
a
dynamic
process,
you
will
not
see
anything,
and
therefore
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
thermal
imager
and
the
function
of
the
thermal
imager
is
to
detect
what
is
beneath
the
surface
by
scanning
that
surface.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
yes.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
well,
i
think
the
court
should
look
at,
first
of
all,
the
videotape
that's
been
lodged,
and
a
few
things
you
should
know
about
the
videotape.
first
of
all,
it
is
not
an
original
exhibit.
the
original
exhibit
has
been
misplaced
or
lost
in
some
way,
but
you
have
a
third
generation
copy
of
the
original
thermal
image
that
was
taken
at
the
time
in
front
of
mr.
kyllo's
house.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
yes,
the
original
was
introduced
in
evidence.
so
i
don't
know
exactly--
mr.
kenneth
lerner
--well,
that
is
one
of
the
exhibits
that
we
have
lodged,
exhibit
107
and
108,
do
show
an
individual
inside
behind
glass,
but
there
is
nothing
with
the
shades
drawn.
that
was...
if
that
was
ever
mentioned--
mr.
kenneth
lerner
--the
thermal
imaging?
mr.
kenneth
lerner
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
that's
correct.
that
is
correct.
and
that
was
a
demonstration
that
our
expert
provided
to
the
court.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
yes,
it
did.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
would
like
to
say
that
i
think
judge
frey
at
the
district
court
level,
was
trying
to
determine
what
this
thermal
imager
would
do
and
what
it
did
in
this
case,
and
she
did
not--
mr.
kenneth
lerner
--and
so
there
is...
apparently
that's
what
the
limit
of
her
factual
holding
is
that
in
this
particular
case,
it
did
not
show
any
person
or
activity,
but
she
did
not
say
that
it's
not
capable
of
showing
what
our
expert
did
show,
that
it
can
show
people
inside
of
windows.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
that's
right.
what
you'll
see
on
government's
exhibit
number
2,
which
is
lodged
with
this
court,
is
a
very
slanted
image,
almost
as
if
picasso
was
taking
a
video,
and
it's
an
indistinct
image
of
the
home,
but
you
can
clearly
see
the
home,
and
what
i
would
like
the
court
to
look
for
is
towards
the
end
of
the
videotape,
as
it
shows
the
back
view
of
the
home,
you
can
see
three
distinct
circles
of
light
along
the
very
top
of
the
roof,
which
is
the
heat
from
heat
lamps
coming
out
of
the
roof,
and
that
is
what
the
thermal
imager
was
capturing
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
absolutely.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
well,
you
know,
you're
the
supreme
court,
so
you
will
do
what
i
assume
you
will
do,
but
i
think
that
you
will
probably
have
then
a
series
of
cases
every
time
a
thermal
imager
is
used
on
a
different
wall
or
on
a
window
or
the
newest
version
of
the
technology
comes
up,
and
i
think
it
really
makes
sense,
unless
the
court
wants
to
revisit
this
every
few
years,
to
look
at
what
the
capability
of
the
science
is.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
well,
i--
mr.
kenneth
lerner
--well,
two
things
i
would
like
to
say
about
that
justice
scalia.
first
of
all,
there
was
no
snow
on
mr.
kyllo's
roof,
and
we
don't
dispute
that.
if
there
had
been
snow
and
it
had
been
melting,
they
could
have
seen
that,
but
there
was
no
snow,
and
it
does
not
snow
very
frequently
in
lawrence,
oregon,
because
it's
on
the
oregon
coast,
and
it's
not
something
that
normally
would
be
expected,
and
so
you
would
not
be
able
to
see
anything
from
a
normal
vantage
point
that
the
public
would
maintain
on
a
regular
basis.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
no,
you
have
not.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
no.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
some
courts
have,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
well,
i
don't
know
if
you
do
or
you
don't.
it
seems
like
you
would
want
to
look
exactly
at
what
happened
in
this
case
and
what
the
technology
does
and
can
do
because
this
is
a
new
technology
and
it
supersedes
the
human
senses.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
well,
that's
not
the
question
that's
before
this
court,
but
in
the
lower
court
we
did
claim
that
it
was
not
accurate
and
should
not
be
used
in
search
warrants.
it's
not
accurate
because
it
can
be
manipulated,
and
there
was
no
showing
that
it
was
a
reliable
device.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
this
particular
machine
is
very
subject
to
manipulation,
but
thermal
imaging
itself
is
not.
it's
based
upon
the
thermodynamic
process,
and
on
scientific
principles.
we
were
concerned
about
this
particular
machine
and
the
image
that
it
produces,
and
that
was
our
complaint.
but
it
still
does
what
all
thermal
imagers
do,
which
is
pinpoint
the
heat
at
a
particular
place
coming
from
the
inside
of
a
house,
from
a
private
place.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
well,
it
wasn't
extraordinary
amount
of
heat
in
the
house.
it
was
the
extraordinary
amount
of
heat
in
very
particular
locations
of
the
house.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
it
may
or
may
not
have.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
we
haven't
raised
that
as
an
issue,
your
honor,
and
i
think
this
court's
holdings
in
miller
and
smith
versus
maryland
seem
to
say
that
if
someone
has
records
that
are
being
held
by
a
third
party,
they
don't
have
an
expectation
of
privacy
that
those
records
might
not
be
searched,
so
the
fact
that
they
were
able
to
subpoena
and
obtain
mr.
kyllo's
energy
records
i
don't
think
is
a
matter
that
we've
raised
as--
mr.
kenneth
lerner
--we
don't
believe
that
it
would,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
that's
right.
well,
whether
they
can
use
the
devices
without
a
warrant
on
the
home.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
well,
that's
absolutely
true,
and
i
think
that's
the
same
argument
that
was
used
in
karo,
that
if
we
need
probable
cause
to
use
this
to
monitor
the
beeper,
then
we'll
effectively
use
this.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
so
the
court
said
that's
not
a
good
enough
reason.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
i
think
anytime
that
the
government
is
seeking
to
capture
information
from
a
private
place
like
the
home,
and
they
cannot
do
it
with
their
own
unaided
human
senses,
then
they
may
not
use
technology
to
do
the
same
thing.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
well,
i
think
the
court
has
repeated
so
many
times
that
to
enter
the
home
or
to
search
the
home
that
you
need
a
warrant--
mr.
kenneth
lerner
--well,
i
think
that's
a
very
dangerous
road
to
go
when
we
start
talking
about
imagers
and
technology
because
what
it's
capturing
really
is
molecular
information
that
migrates
through
our
walls
and
therefore
if
we
are
now
saying
that
we
can
capture
that
kind
of
information
without
a
warrant,
we
can
reduce
our
whole
world
to
that
type
of
wave
and
molecule,
and
our
walls
mean
nothing
because
our
walls
cannot
contain
that
kind
of
information.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
well,
utility
records
give
you
generalized
information
about
someone's
electrical
use,
and
we
actually
did
have
quite
a
complete
hearing
about
those
records
and
heard
from
utility
industry
people,
and
people's
energy
bills
vary
quite
dramatically
depending,
frankly,
on
how
many
women
live
in
the
home
versus
men,
how
many
times
you
do
laundry,
who
is
taking
showers,
things
that
you
plug
in.
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
you're
using
heat
lamps
or
that
you're
growing
marijuana.
so
it's
too
generalized
type
of
information
to
really
persuade
a
magistrate
that
that
means
there's
marijuana
growing.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
in
this
case--
mr.
kenneth
lerner
--the
court
hasn't
really
addressed
that
point
yet,
so
that's
going
to
be
a
very
difficult
question
when
it
comes
up.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
my
standard
is
if
it
is
unavailable
to
the
unaided
eye,
simply
because
there
is
a
window
and
you
can
see
deep
inside
that
window
that
no
one
else
in
the
normal
course
could
have
seen
with
some
high
powered
technology--
mr.
kenneth
lerner
--eyeglasses
are
fine.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
well,
eyeglasses
give
you
normal
vision,
and
they
are
an
accepted
way
of
repairing
disabled
vision--
mr.
kenneth
lerner
--but
when
you
start
to
use
technology,
that
takes
us
beyond
the
human
senses,
now
the
court
has
said--
mr.
kenneth
lerner
--well,
the
line
is
drawn
there
because
the
privacy
is
predicated
upon
what
someone
can
knowingly
or
unknowingly
expose,
and
once
we're
in
the
level
of
technology,
people
have
no
way
of
knowing
when
they
are
voluntarily
exposing
something.
yes,
we
could
all
live
in
rooms
that
totally
close
the
windows
off--
mr.
kenneth
lerner
--yes.
it
is
partly
what
we
all
expect.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
how
about
a
dog
sniff?
mr.
kenneth
lerner
right.
the
court...
well,
i'm
not
going
as
far
as
the
court
did
in
place
because
place
was
limited
to
narcotics
and
sensing
only,
very
specifically
contraband
in
a
very
public
place
and
a
very
transitory
place,
and
i
think
that
the
court
has
been
careful
to
limit
place
to
that
circumstance.
we're
not
saying
that
you
can't
use
technology
out
in
the
world,
but
we're
saying
that
the
home
has
such
a
heightened
expectation
of
privacy,
to
use
technology
to
pry
into
our
homes
is
a
very,
very
different
point,
and
the
court
has
not
addressed
whether
we
can
just
have
police
dogs
running
around
people's
homes
yet.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
with
10/10
vision?
mr.
kenneth
lerner
the
thermal
imaging
will
give
you
a
more
specific
impression
such
as
here
it
showed
three
distinct,
evenly
spaced
circles
of
light
at
the
peak
of
the
roof
from
which
they
could
conclude
that
this
is
very
similar
to
other
marijuana
growing
that
they
have
seen.
they
did
not
have
any
other
information
about
mr.
kyllo,
no
one
had
been
inside
his
home,
there
was
no
tip
that
he
was
growing
marijuana,
so
sometimes
the
utility
records
are
enough
when
you
have
a
specific
tip
about
what
someone
might
be
doing
in
their
home,
but
when
you
lack
that
type
of
specificity,
the
normal
heat
and
electrical
records
don't
really
tell
you
whether
the
high
electricity
is
because
they're
growing
marijuana
or
if
it's
because
they
take
a
lot
of
showers
and
do
a
lot
of
laundry,
have
a
lot
of
appliances
or
an
inefficient
heating
system
or
anything,
taking
saunas
or
anything
else.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
the
imaging
will
give
you
specific
heat
impressions
from
various
places
in
the
home,
coming
through
the
wall,
telling
you
what's
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
well,
that
would
be
a
different
question
than
the
use
of
technology.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
because
they
would
be
intruding
on
the
curtilage,
where
they
physically
invading
and
touching
the
wall,
i'm
not
sure
that
they're--
mr.
kenneth
lerner
--i'd
say
then
that
is
something
that
would
be
permissible
because
it's
something
that
is
akin
to
our
normal
human
senses,
that
they
could
determine
how
hot
the
wall
was
by
feeling
it.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
well,
obviously
i
don't
think
that
we
would
prohibit
things
like
thermometers
or
watches
or
things
that
we
typically
use
in
our
daily
lives.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
right.
i
think
that--
mr.
kenneth
lerner
--that
would
be
a
really
different
question,
yes.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
right.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
we
don't
have
to
assume
that
we
do,
your
honor,
but
technology
has
the
ability
to
penetrate
into
our
private
lives,
and
that's
the
problem.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
so
that
what
i'm...
i
guess
our
position
is
that
the
burden
really
is
improperly
placed
on
the
citizen
to
anticipate
what
type
of
technology
the
government
may
come
up
with,
and
perhaps
you're
correct
that
if
it's
sufficiently
sophisticated
rather
than
something
that's
very
common
and
ordinary,
then
it
shouldn't
be
the
burden
of
the
citizen
to
anticipate
what
they
can't
particularly
know
or
may
not
know,
and
then
take
safeguarding
measures.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
i'm
not
saying
that
because
i
think
once
we--
mr.
kenneth
lerner
--well,
at
this
point
the
effect
of
sophistication
is
that
it
is
not
commonly
used
by
normal
people
in
their
every
day
life.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
i
would
hope
not,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
well,
we
can
now...
we
have
the
ability
to
wiretap
everybody's
telephone.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
but
we
don't
do
that.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
that's
right.
that's
because
the
court
has
said
that.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
right.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
well,
the
only
difference
between
the
wiretap
issue
is
because
this
court
has
said
you
can't
do
that.
we
have
privacy
in
our
conversations.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
and
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
we
may
expect
people
may
walk
around
with
binoculars,
but
that
does
depend
on
the
vantage
point
and
where
a
person
is
located
as
well.
but
we
don't
expect
them
to
walk
around
with
thermal
imagers.
when
they
become
so
prevalent
as
justice
souter
has
suggested,
then
it
may
present
the
issue
of
wiretapping,
where
the
court
needs
to
say,
we
don't
expect
or
even
if
we
do
expect
we
do
not
want
people
to
be
intruding
into
our
homes
and
finding
out
things
that
heat
can
reveal
about
our
private
activities.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
that
is
not
the
value,
that's
correct,
and
unfortunately
we
do
have
already
technology
that
the
court
has
already
approved,
such
as
field
glasses
and
flashlights
and
illumination
devices
and
things
of
that
nature
without
analyzing
it
under
katz
or
the
vantage
point
or
the
normalcy
of
people
using
it,
and
that's
what
justice
breyer's
bringing
up.
i
do
think
that
each
of
those
situations
would
require
the
court
to
evaluate.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
a
dark
corner
of
someone's
home,
your
honor?
mr.
kenneth
lerner
we're
not
saying
that
they
would
have
any
expectation
of
privacy
outside,
in
hiding.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
well,
it
is
a
technological
device
that
provides
illumination
that
aids
the
human
senses.
the
court
has
said
there
can
be
some
aids
to
the
human
senses
such
as
that.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
yes,
there
is
the
lee
case,
your
honor,
in
'27
did
say
that
flashlight,
search
lights,
actually
it
was
on
a
boat,
and
it
provided
illumination
of
boats
already
out
in
the
public
view.
this
court
said
in
texas
versus
brown
you
can
use
a
flashlight
to
inspect
a
car,
which
is
also
in
public
view
and
there's
a
lesser
expectation
of--
mr.
kenneth
lerner
--the
court
hasn't
said
that
you
can
shine
it
into
the
window
of
a
house.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
i
think
that
it
would
depend
on
the
vantage
point
and
what
the
person
has
knowingly
exposed
and
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
well,
i
don't
think
that
an
officer
can
just
walk
up
to
anyone's
home
and
start
shining
a
flashlight
into
their
home
without
a
warrant.
the
court
hasn't
answered
that
question.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
yes.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
it
is
used
in
a
number
of
industrial
processes,
your
honor.
for
instance,
where
electrical
circuits
may
be
burning
too
hot
and
indicate
there
might
be
a
short
circuit
behind
metal,
they
would
use
a
thermal
imager.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
yes.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
well,
our
expert
said
that
the
number
of
uses
are
probably
unlimited.
it
just
depends
on
the
human
imagination
of
what
you
can
use...
gather
from
heat.
but
i
think
that
they
are
mostly
in
law
enforcement
use
to
penetrate
the
home.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
if
i'm...
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
unless
there's
another
question.
mr.
kenneth
lerner
thank
you,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
government's
position
that
they
were
just
seeing
generalized
heat
loss
is
not
correct.
i
disagree
with
that.
if
you
look
at
the
video
taken,
you
will
see
that
it's
very
specifically
showing
three
glowing
areas,
evenly
spaced.
that's
very
specific
private
information
that
it's
obtaining
about
the
inside
of
the
house.
it's
not
generalized
heat
loss,
and
it
is
information
that
they
could
not
have
determined
any
other
way.
only
by
the
use
of
the
thermal
imager.
i
also
think
that
the
government's
test
is
really
going
to
lead
down
a
difficult
road
for
this
court.
when
will
information
become
private
enough
that
it's
protected
or
when
is
it
going
to
be
specific
enough
that
it
should
be
protected?
these
are
very
vague
concepts
that
every
case
is
going
to
turn
on
the
specifics
of
the
facts
which
i
think
is
going
to
be
very
troubling
for
courts
and
for
the
police
in
the
future,
and
really
don't
set
any
guidance
for
how
to
use
this
machine.
i
think
that's
a
very
problematic
area
that
the
court's
going
to
have
to
grapple
with.
if
there
are
any
other
questions--
