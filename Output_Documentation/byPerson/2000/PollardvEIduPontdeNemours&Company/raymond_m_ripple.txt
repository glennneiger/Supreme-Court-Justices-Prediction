mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
issue
before
the
court
today
involves
the
division
of
responsibilities
between
the
judge
and
jury
under
this
restructured
remedies
program
under
the
'91
act,
and
that
is
the
one
that
exists
today
and
did
exist
at
the
time
of
trial.
the
division
follows
fairly
conventional
system.
the
judge
retains
authority
over
equitable
matters.
the
jury
has
its
powers
to
assess
damages.
a
facial
reading
of
the
statutory
scheme,
in
fact,
shows
that
compensatory
damage
and,
as
we
get
to
it,
one
of
its
component
parts,
future
pecuniary
losses,
are
subject
to
decision
by
the
jury.
now,
what
i
would
like
to
do
just
briefly
is
step
back
and
see
where
the
parties
agree
here
and
really
where
we
shouldn't
differ.
i
listened
very
closely
to
petitioner
this
morning,
and
i
thought
there
was
no
disagreement,
and
maybe
there
isn't,
on
the
question
of
what
front
pay
is.
historically
when
you
boil
it
down,
the
court
said
that
front
pay
is
future
lost
earnings
or
wages.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
that's
generally
true.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
as
far
as
that
goes,
that's
correct.
there
is
a
great
difference,
i
believe,
also
between
back
pay
and
front
pay,
back
pay
being
generally
restitutionary,
named
by
congress
specifically
as
an
equitable
remedy
directed
by
congress
in,
i
believe
it
is,
(a)(1)
of
the
statute
to
exercise
its
discretion
specifically
on
back
pay.
nothing,
of
course,
has
ever
been
said
about
front
pay
anywhere
in
the
statutory
scheme.
but
what
i
was
just
going
to
get
to
was
i
think
there
is
agreement
between
the
parties
as
to
what
this
front
pay
means,
which
is
critical
to
this
case,
and
then,
in
fact,
petitioner
in
her
opening
brief,
on
page
14,
concedes
that,
in
effect,
it
is
lost
future
earnings.
the
government
also
acknowledges
in
their
brief
that,
in
fact,
front
pay
is
by
calculation
lost
future
earnings
or
wages.
i
believe
in
the
government's
brief,
it's
footnote
12.
i
think
there's
general
agreement
among
the
parties
as
to
what
front
pay
means.
good
starting
point.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
again,
as
i
said
before,
i
don't
think
it
does
exactly
at
all.
in
fact,
this
whole
title
of
post
judgment
back
pay
was
new
to
me
when
i
saw
it.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
as
to
which?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
i
agree
that
as
to
back
pay,
based
on
the
statute,
the
court
had
discretion.
i
do
not
see
that
as
to
front
pay.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
whether
they
modeled
it
on
back
pay,
i
think...
i
would
take
exception
to
that.
what
they
said
is,
for
whatever
reason
up
to
1991,
if
you
had
a
situation...
take
the
hard
case
where
equity
has
failed,
frustrated.
they
can't
reinstate.
for
whatever
reasons,
rule
of
necessity,
whatever,
the
lower
courts
invented
this
front
pay,
called
it
front
pay.
if
you
get
beyond
that
step,
of
course
the
courts
are
going
to
say
it's
within
their
discretion.
many
of
the
courts--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--i'm
not
sure
that
was
the
first
case.
the
first
one
i
remember
was
not
a
seniority
case.
i
think
it
was
the
patterson
case,
fourth
circuit.
i
can't
remember
the
date.
i
think
one
or
the
other
of
us
have
cited
it
in
the
brief,
but--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--no...
well,
it
does...
if
justice
ginsburg
has
a
question,
it
matters.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
and
i'm
trying
to
be
helpful...
i'm
trying
to
be
helpful,
not
facetious,
but
i'm
trying
to
be
helpful.
i
think
the
next
point,
though,
where
we
do
differ
but
we
shouldn't
perhaps
is
that
future
pecuniary
losses,
the
statutory
term,
really,
when
you
look
at
it,
we
don't
need
webster,
bouvier,
or
black.
it
should
be
inclusive
of
future
lost
earnings
just
by
plain
english.
we
really
shouldn't
disagree
on
that,
and
maybe...
i
was
listening
carefully,
but
maybe
we
don't
disagree
on
that.
where
we
do
part
company...
and
this
is
critical
to
the
case.
where
we
part
company
is
over
section
(b)(2),
the
exclusion
to
compensatory
damages.
now,
you
remember
that
says,
compensatory
damages
will
not
include
back
pay,
interest
on
back
pay,
or
remedies
under
706(g),
the
old
equity
statute.
now,
if
we
understand
the
petitioner's
argument,
at
least
in
their
reply
brief,
what
they're
saying
is,
if
we
go...
i'm
sorry.
front
pay
is
now
a
legal
remedy.
what
of
this
language
in
the
exclusionary
clause?
and
the
answer
is
really,
in
our
judgment,
quite
simple.
there
are
a
number
of
other
monetary
reliefs
that
are
available
in
an
equitable
form
other
than
front
pay.
they
are...
let
me
just
give
you
a
few
examples.
in
promotional
cases
justice
ginsburg
was
mentioning,
very
often
there's
a
monetary
sum
involved.
there
have
been
cases
involving
equitable
accounting,
usually
involve
professional
organizations
such
as
law
firms,
accounting
firms--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--in
promotional
cases--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--that's
right.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
in
some
cases,
yes.
it
could
be
a
going
forward
pay,
either
in
lump
sum
or
in
grade.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
that's
what
i
mean,
going
forward,
front
pay.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
well,
you
can
have...
and
this
gets
really
to
the
next
point,
but
you
can
have
a
situation
where,
for
instance,
equitable
relief
is
granted
and
still
have
monetary
relief
as
it
relates
going
forward.
if--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--some
courts
have
called
it
that.
whatever
moniker
you
want
to
put
on
it--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--i
guess
i
would
disagree
with
you,
justice
souter,
on
one
point.
i
think
the
point
i
was
on
is
not
bound
in
with
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
front
pay.
the
question
is,
is
there
any
other
equitable
monetary
sum?
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
that's
right.
if
you
pulled
front
pay--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--not
necessarily.
again,
the
usual
use
of
front
pay
is
when
there
is
no
equitable
relief.
in
a
promotion
case,
there's
usually
an
order.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
the--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--can
be.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
under
tull,
if
it's
somehow
incident
to
or...
i
think
the
word
used
is
adjunct
to
the
equitable
relief--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--of
the
requirement
of
rehiring?
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
that's
possible.
let
me
stake
out--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--no,
not
completely.
if,
in
fact,
an
injunction
is
entered,
if,
in
fact,
a
reinstatement
is
ordered,
and
there
is,
for
instance,
a
period
of
time,
short
period
of
time,
until
that
slot
opens
up
where
you
can
put
the
person
back
in,
that
sum
of
money,
whatever
you
call
it,
is
probably
incident
to
the
equitable
relief,
and
therefore
can
be
considered
as
equitable
rather
than
legal.
in
this
case,
of
course,
what
we're
dealing
with
is
there
will
not
be
a
reinstatement.
apparently
she
does
not
want
to
be
reinstated,
and
apparently
the
judge
was
not
going
to
order
it,
so
this
is
a
pure
case
of
front
pay
or
whatever
we
call
it
now
in
lieu
of--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--we
don't
think,
in
our
view
of
the
case,
that
there
will
be
many
situations
where
pure
front
pay,
let's
say,
front
pay
in
lieu
of
reinstatement
like
our
case,
would
rise
up
to
that
level.
that
would
be,
i
think,
rather
unusual.
the--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--300,000.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
that's
also
the
consequence,
your
honor,
of
the
statutory
scheme--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--i
think
one
place
to
start...
and
please
stop
me,
justice
breyer,
if
i'm
not
getting
to
your
question
on
that.
i
think
one
place
to
start
is
again
go
back
and
look
at
(b)(2)
exclusions
as
we
were
doing.
where
i
was
was
the...
for
instance,
there
is
the
example
of
other
monetary
sums
equitable
in
nature
involving
cases
involving
unions.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
unions.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
unions,
where
the
union
is
the
defendant
in
the
case
brought
by
the
employees,
where
union
dues
have
had
to
have
been
paid
back
to
the
employees,
where
they...
monies
paid
in
levies
to
the
unions
or
whatever
program
they
had
going
at
the
time
were
required
to
be
paid
back.
that
wouldn't
be
in
the
traditional
sense
of
true
back
pay.
it's
a
different
relationship
with
the
union,
but
there
have
been
some
cases
on
that.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
no.
no,
no.
this
is
under
title--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--vi.
that's
right.
as
you
know,
under
706(g)--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--that's
right.
employers
and
employment
agencies
would
also
be
covered.
our
case...
let
me
answer
your
question,
justice
breyer,
in
this
manner,
and
maybe
i
can
satisfy
it.
our
case
is
that
such...
looking
at
front
pay
now,
it
is
a
monetary
sum.
it
certainly
carries
the
presumption,
being
a
monetary
sum,
that
it
is
a
legal
remedy.
the
question
is,
does
it
fall
into
exceptions
to
that?
our
argument
is,
no,
first,
it
is
not
incident
to,
especially
in
this
case,
incident
to
another...
an
equitable
remedy,
so
it
doesn't
fall
into
the
tull
exception,
intertwined
or
incident
to.
second,
it's
not
really
restitutionary
in
nature
as
back
pay,
this
court,
i
think,
has
recognized
is
basically
restitutionary
in
nature.
i
think
that
was
the
curtis--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--that's
our
ultimate--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--answer
to
your
last
question
is
no.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
because
back
pay
has
a
history
in
this
court
and
all
the
other
courts
of
being
traditionally
an
equitable
remedy.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
back
pay
traditionally
highly
restitutional
in
nature,
equitable,
restitutional.
secondly,
specifically
named
by
congress,
and
that's
worth
something.
we
said
so
in
terry
case.
it
is
easily
calculable--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--front
pay
or
back
pay?
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
i
don't
think
in
the
context
of
this
case,
whether
or
not
back
pay
is
implicated
is
really
terribly
important
in
the
long
run.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
no.
i
think
i
understand
now.
if
you're
referring...
justice
breyer
perhaps
referring
a
bit
to
our
last
argument,
what
i
consider
the
equity
jurisdiction
argument,
did
the
district
courts
ever
have
authority
to
create
front
pay?
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
no.
under
that
theory,
the
larger
theory,
no.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
no.
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
i
think
this
court
could
write
the
opinion
that
because
under
the
historical
analysis,
front
pay,
what
we
call
now
front
pay,
is
not
incident
to
the
granting
of
another
equitable
relief.
equity
never
had
jurisdiction
for
that,
at
least
at
the
time
of
the
founding
of
the
country.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
i
have...
we
have
great
faith
in
the
federal
district
judges,
and
i
don't
see--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--i
don't
think...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
there's
a
serious
practical
problem
here.
anyone
that's
tried
one
of
these
cases...
there
are
points
in
a
case
where
the
judge
can
make
the
decision.
am
i
going
to
reinstate
this
person
or
not?
certainly
before
the
prayer
conference,
that
decision
can
be
made.
therefore...
and
we
would
suggest
these
cases
only
be
tried
to
jury
on
special
interrogatories,
the
only
way
it
makes
sense,
and
the
only
way
if
you
have--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--that's
right.
absolutely.
and
one
of
the
strengths
of
the
federal
district
judges
is
they
have
the
full
panoply
of
the
rules
and
any...
some
other
inherent
powers--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--answer
your
question,
first,
we
believe
obviously
you
need
to
look
at
the
statute
first.
but
if
you
get
there,
if
you
get
there,
there
are
some
stray
remarks
regarding--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--yes.
i
think...
not
the
technical
term
of
that
remark.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
the
floor
statements
are
individualized
remarks.
they're
isolated
remarks.
there
is
also
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
no.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
it
did
in
1991.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
he
did
not.
in
fact--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--in
the
house,
no.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
he
did
in
the
house,
and
he
was
one
of
the
sponsors,
but--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--yes.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
i
didn't
think
so.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
no,
there
was
not.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
(b)(2)--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--right.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
i
don't
know
any
legislative
history
that
says,
if
you
get
down
to
legislative
history,
that
says
that
it
was
related
to
the
cap,
the
(b)(2)
exclusion.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
from...
yes.
all
right.
on
its
face,
yes.
it
excludes
it
for
compensatory
damages.
that
seems
to
be--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
your
first
question.
i
think,
looking
at
the
exclusionary
section,
it
was
certainly
one
way
to
exclude
certain
matters,
to
make
sure
that
they
weren't
subject
to
the
cap.
yes,
yes.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
they
had.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
without
calling
it
that,
there
were
some--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--yes.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
i
think
that
was
the
intent
in
'72.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
usually
back
pay
is
a
practical
matter
in
these
cases.
it's
relatively
manageable,
it's
understandable,
it's
calculable
and
by
statute
only
goes
back
two
years
anyway.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
i
guess
i
don't
understand
that
argument,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
i
don't
know
if
i've
ever
seen
it
construed
that
way.
it's
an
interesting
observation.
i
don't
think
i've
ever
seen
it
construed.
usually
the
affirmative
action--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--i
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
i
understand.
the...
i
don't
think
i've
ever
seen
it
construed
quite
that
way.
usually
affirmative
action
is
more
of
an
injunctive
type
relief.
that's
when
i
have
seen
it,
but
i'm...
i
just
have
not
seen
it
played
out
that
way.
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
back
pay
certainly.
yes,
back
pay
certainly,
and
my
memory
is--
mr.
raymond
m.
ripple
--some
prospective
maybe
incident
to
other
more
affirmative
relief.
yes.
there
are
some
cases
of
that.
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
we'll
submit
the
matter.
