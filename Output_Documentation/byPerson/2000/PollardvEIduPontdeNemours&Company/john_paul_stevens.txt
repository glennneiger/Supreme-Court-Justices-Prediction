justice
john
paul
stevens
--let
me
ask
the
question
in
another
way.
are
you
arguing,
in
effect,
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
subtract
anything
from
what
was
previously
authorized
by
706?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
you've
got
to
explain
why
that's
different--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--from
front
pay
for
me
to
follow
the
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
two
questions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
that
people
are
going
to
change
their
views
on
legislative
history
at
this
particular
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
first
of
all,
was
there
a
demand
for
a
jury
trial
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
secondly,
is
there
anything
either
in
the
statute
or
the
legislative...
you
can
go
either
way
you
want
on
this...
to
suggest
that
the
purpose
of
(b)(2)
had
any
purpose
other
than
to
impose
a
cap
on
the
additional
relief
that
was
authorized
by
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
exclude--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--did
it
have
any
purpose
except
related
to
the
cap?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
perfectly
clear,
just
looking
at
the
statute
itself,
the
sole
purpose
of
this
is
to
exclude
certain
things
from
the
cap?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
things
that
are
excluded
are
those
that
were
put
in
that
had
not
been
in
the
statute
before.
