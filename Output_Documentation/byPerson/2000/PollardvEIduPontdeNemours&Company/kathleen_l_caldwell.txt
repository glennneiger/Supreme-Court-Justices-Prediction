mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
congress
never
intended
to
include
front
pay
as
a
type
of
compensatory
damages
when
it
enacted
the
civil
rights
act
of
1991.
this
is
made
clear
by
looking
at
the
act
itself,
section
2
of
the
act,
which
provided
that
the
congressional
purpose
was
to
provide
additional
remedies.
this
was
intended
to
deter
harassment
and
to
prevent
intentional
discrimination
in
the
workplace,
just
as
in
the
vinson
case.
this
legislation
was
stated
by
congress
to
be
necessary
to
provide
these--
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
--all
right.
that's
the
next
analysis,
your
honor.
if
you
look
at
(a)(1)
of
the
legislation
itself,
1981a-(a)(1),
it
provides
that
the
complaining
party...
and
this
is
a
quote
from
page
2
of
the
blue
brief.
the
complaining
party
may
recover
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
as
allowed
in
subsection
(b),
in
addition
to
any
relief
authorized
by
section
706(g).
now,
what
that
means
is
that
congress
was
not
enacting--
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
--it's
page
1,
your
honor.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
it
starts
on
page
1
and
goes
over
onto
page
2.
what
congress
was
saying
was
that
we're
not
changing
what
the
status
quo
was.
we're
adding
to
it,
and
they
did
it
very
carefully
in
(a)(1)
of
the
act.
you
then
look
to
(b)(2)
of
the
act,
which
is
the
first
part
that
is
pertinent
to
our
analysis.
in
this
particular
part--
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
--page
2.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
where
it
says,
exclusions
from
compensatory
damages.
compensatory
damages
awarded
under
this
section
shall
not
include
back
pay,
interest
on
back
pay,
or
any
other
type
of
relief
authorized
under
section
2000e-5(g)
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
which
is
the
same
as
706(g).
now,
what
this
language
specifically
says
is
that
we're
not
disturbing
the
status
quo.
what
was
available
previously
is
still
available.
we're
simply
adding
the
supplemental
or
the
additional
remedy.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
it
did
use
the
word
back
pay.
if
you
look
at
the
original
language...
and
it's
provided
again
on
the
quote
that
starts
on
page
1...
the
language
talks...
of
the
original
act,
706(g),
in
1964
provided,
and
can
order
such
affirmative
action
as
may
be
appropriate,
which
might
include
but
is
not
limited
to
reinstatement
or
hiring
of
employees
with
or
without
back
pay.
then
in
19--
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
--that's
correct.
and
that
was
the
language--
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
--the
central
question
for
this
court
is,
what
was
the
intent
of
congress?
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
that's
right.
and
the
laws
that
it
wrote
in
1972,
there
was
an
intent
of
congress
to
provide
additional
relief
to
what
had
been
provided
under
the
1964
act,
and
they
added
the
language,
or
any
other
equitable
relief
as
the
court
deems
appropriate,
clearly
discretionary
with
the
court
and
therefore
equitable,
your
honor.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
it
does
sound
like
straight
legal
relief,
your
honor,
but
if
you
look
at
specific
performance,
which
is
a
form
of
equity,
and
if
the
relief
that
would
normally
be
required
of
the
person,
which
would
be
injunctive
in
nature,
is
not
available
for
whatever
reason,
such
as
the
land
no
longer
exists
on
the
market,
then
relief
can
be
given,
which
would
be
equitable,
and
yet
be
monetary
in
nature.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
i
think
there
is
an
analogy
in
equity,
in
the
maximums
of
equity,
which
do
lend
credence
to
what
congress
created,
which
was
a
form
of
equitable
relief
involving
monetary
relief,
both
back
pay
and
later
the
court
created
remedy
of
front
pay.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
not
at
all,
your
honor,
and
that's
one
of
the
central
problems
of
the
concept
of
front
pay
as
a
purely
legal
remedy.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
front
pay
is
much
more
fluid.
it
depends
on
the
circumstances.
the
first
consideration
is
not
whether
the
person's
entitled
to
front
pay.
the
first
consideration
is
whether
that
plaintiff
should
be
reinstated,
and
is
there
a
compelling
reason
why
they
should
not
be
reinstated,
and
there
are
numerous
examples
of
circumstances
where
reinstatement
would
be
inappropriate.
for
example,
there's
another
employee
in
the
place
in
which
the
plaintiff...
to
which
the
plaintiff
would
be
reinstated.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
some
courts
have
fashioned
it
as,
we'll
give
the
company
two
years
to
find
an
appropriate
position
for
this
plaintiff,
given
the
training,
experience,
background.
and
during
that
two
year
period,
that
person
will
be
paid
the
pay
that
they
otherwise
would
have
missed.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
often
it
comes
right
back
to
the
court,
and
in
the
sixth
circuit
case
of
shore
v.
federal
express,
which
went
up
on
appeal
twice
to
the
sixth
circuit...
and
it's
one
of
the
leading
cases
from
the
sixth
circuit
in
which
the
sixth
circuit
recognizes
front
pay
as
equitable...
the
plaintiff
was
held
by
the
judge
not
to
be
required
to
go
back
to
that
employment
because
of
the
hostile
environment,
the
painful
situation
she
would
find
herself
in.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
well,
what
he
did
was
he
fashioned
the
remedy,
saying
that
she
would
never
again
find
a
job
equivalent
in
pay
to
what
she
had
federal
express,
and
each
year
federal
express
is
required
to
pay
her
the
difference
between
what
she
earned
and
what
she
would
have
earned.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
the
hallmark
really
is
the
discretion
of
the
court.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
well,
front
pay
applies
to
both
instances,
and
normally
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
it
should
remain
with
the
court
rather
than
with
a
jury.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
if
i
prevail,
that's
not
the
way
it
would
work,
your
honor.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
the
way
it
would
work--
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
--there
should
be
an
instruction
to
that
effect,
but
there
are
certain
future
pecuniary
amounts
that
the
jury
would
be
instructed
on.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
and
those
would
be
such
things
as
future
medicals,
moving
expenses,
those
sorts
of
items,
which
are
clearly
within
the
confines
of
what
congress
allowed
in
enacting
this
legislation.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
it
does
not
function
the
same
as
a
sum
certain
that
a
jury
would
find
as
to
future
losses.
it's
a
different
animal.
also
i
believe
if
you
look
to--
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
--it
would
certainly
thwart
the
intent
of
congress
to
provide
make
whole
relief.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
equitable
relief.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
well,
damages
are
a
portion
or
a
type
of
equitable
relief
which
have
been
fashioned
and
made
available
under
title
vii.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
and
the
difficulty
here...
and
perhaps
i'm
not
expressing
it
clearly
enough...
is
that
when
a
court
reaches
the
issue
of
front
pay,
the
court
is
normally
joining
it
with
some
form
of
injunctive
relief
that's
certainly
not
within
the
provenance
of
a
jury.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
you
can
get
compensatory
damages
under
the
act.
if
you
look
at
(b)(2),
it
excludes
damages
that
were
previously
available.
it
says,
compensatory
damages
awarded
under
this
section.
in
other
words,
1981a.
it
does
not
include
the
prior
relief,
and
that
would
include
front
pay,
because
front
pay
was
part
of
the
relief
that
had
been
awardable
and
had
been
recognized
by
eleven
of
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
we
have
legislative
history
which
makes
clear
that
all
the
persons
who
expressed
any
statement
on
the
new
act--
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
--yes,
justice
scalia,
i
am.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
absolutely.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
is
equitable.
and,
again,
very,
very
briefly,
because--
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
--historically
the
jury
did
not
award
back
pay.
they
do
now.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
well,
that
is...
i
believe
justice
kennedy
asked
a
question
of
practicality
in
terms
of
how
it
has
been
working
in
the
court
systems.
but
it
is
in
their
discretion--
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
--sir?
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
i
believe
it
should
not
work
that
way.
i
think
in
actuality
the
judge
has
the
discretion
to
give
the
instruction
on
back
pay,
and
if
the
judge
gives
the
instruction,
then
there's
a
calculation
by
the
jury.
but
that's
a
different
animal
from
front
pay
to
that
extent,
because
there
is
a
two
step
process
in
front
pay.
first,
the
issue
of
reinstatement
entirely
for
the
court.
second,
the
issue
of
front
pay
which
is
a
matter
of
not
straight
calculation.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
if
you
look
at
706(g)
itself,
that
allows
an
award
of
back
pay
and
other
equitable
relief
regardless
of
reinstatement.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
before
it
gets
to
front
pay.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
the
converse
is
equally
difficult.
if
this
court
decides
that
front
pay
is
now
awardable
exclusively
under
1981a,
the
effect
will
be
that
persons
who
were
discriminated
against
but
not
intentionally
will
no
longer
be
able
to
get
front
pay.
that
will
certainly
thwart
the
make
whole
purposes
of
the
act.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
absolutely.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
and
keep
in
mind
that
front
pay
did
not...
that
term
was
not
coined
until
1977,
some
five
years
after
the
1972
amendment.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
it
does
not,
but
the
original
706(g)
as
enacted
in
1972
certainly
does
that.
back
pay--
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
--that's
right.
ms.
kathleen
l.
caldwell
and
this
court
certainly
was
well
aware
of
it
in
the
albemarle
paper
v.
moody
case
in
which
the
court
strongly
expressed
the
need
for
make
whole
relief
to
prevent
discrimination.
if
i
may
reserve
my...
i'm
up.
thank
you.
