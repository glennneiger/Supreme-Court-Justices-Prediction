chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
terms
of
the
legislation
itself,
rather
than
what
members
of
congress
might
have
said
about
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
on
page
2
of
the
blue
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
page
1.
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
or
any
other
equitable
relief
as
the
court
deems
appropriate.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
question
boils
down
here
to
whether
or
not
so
called
front
pay
is
equitable
relief,
doesn't
it,
as
opposed
to
damages?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
look
to
the
intent
of
congress,
i
suppose,
by
looking
at
the
laws
that
it
wrote.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
a
court
of
equity
has
ever
traditionally
awarded
damages
in
the
sense
of
front
pay?
that
is,
you
promised
to
hire
me
for
five
years.
i
work
for
the
first
year.
you
fire
me
for
no
reason.
i
sue
you.
i
want
the
balance
of
what
i
would
have
earned
in
the
next
four
years,
minus
whatever
damages
i've
mitigated.
to
me,
that's
classical
damages
awarded
by
a
common
law
court,
not
by
equity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
there
was
a
doctrine
where
contracts
for
personal
services
were
not
specifically
enforceable,
longley
against
wagner.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
just
contrary
to
the
most
fundamental
understanding
of
the
difference
between
equity
and
law.
the
law
awards
damages.
equity
awards
other
kinds
of
relief
when
damages
are
not
sufficient.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
under
the
new
law
as
written,
you
can
get
compensatory
damages.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
someone
who
has
been
discriminated
against
and
wants
damages
but
does
not
want
reinstatement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so...
but
you're
saying
that
the
court
must
always
first
deal
with
reinstatement
before
it
gets
to
back
pay
or--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--to
front
pay.
but
in
a
situation
where
the
plaintiff,
although
wronged,
does
not
wish
reinstatement,
that's
not
going
to
be
the
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
caldwell.
mr.
roberts,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
was
certainly
compensatory
damages
provided.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
says,
the
relief
that
is
available.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
much
closer
to
traditional
damages,
front
pay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
no.
not
damages
for
a
breach
that
goes
into
the
future.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that,
you
know,
if
i
am
terminated
before
the
time
for
my
performance
of
services
contract
expires,
that
i
can't
get
damages?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
that's
true
of
damages,
too.
damages
are
restitutionary,
if
that's
how
you
define
restitution.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
a
contract
case,
a
contract
for
personal
services--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
don't
see
how
that
would
affect
the
right
to
jury
trial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
ripple,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
important
here,
i
take
it,
is
that...
are
these
things
excluded
from
compensatory
damages
which
are
capped?
of
course,
the
way
you
describe
front
pay
is
something
that
would
be
so
insignificant
that
it
could
never
be...
it
would
never
be...
rise
up
anywhere
close
to
the
cap.
isn't
that
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
is
the
amount
of
the
cap?
is
it--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
ripple.
the
case
is
submitted.
