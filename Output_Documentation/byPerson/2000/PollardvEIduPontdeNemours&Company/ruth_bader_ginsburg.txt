but,
ms.
caldwell,
the
status
quo
that
you're
talking
about
is
the
status
quo
created
by
courts,
because
at
no
point
did
the
statute
use
the
words
front
pay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
did
use
the
words
back
pay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
caldwell,
you're
describing
this
as
the
typical
substitute
for
reinstatement,
but
you
did
say
that
front
pay
covers
a
wide
range,
and
at
least
one
area
that
it
covers
is
a
person
qualifies
for
the
promotion
or
for
the
job,
doesn't
get
it
because
of
discrimination.
but
then
there's
a
seniority
system,
so
the
job
isn't
there.
front
pay
is
you
pay
the
person
at
the
job
level
where
they
are
now
until
there's
a
vacancy.
or
if
there's
a
training
program,
she
hasn't
been
promoted
but
she
would
need
a
training
program,
you
pay
her
while
she
gets
the
training
program
at
the
higher
rate.
and
front
pay
in
those
situations
was
conceived
of
as
an
incentive
to
stop
the
employer
from
foot
dragging.
so
you're
treating
this
in
the
most
questionable
case
where
front
pay
is
originally,
in
the
situations
i
describe,
it's
much
more
easy
to
characterize
as
equitable.
is
that
not
so?
and
you're
giving
us
these
cases
where
she's
never
going
to
be
in
the
job.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying,
ms.
caldwell,
essentially
that
front
pay
is
post
judgment
back
pay,
that
is,
that
they
are
identical
animals,
and
congress
characterized
back
pay
as
equitable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
front
pay,
since
it
is
of
the
same
character,
is
as
much
equitable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
sure
that
that's
the
right
answer?
under
the
statute,
back
pay
is
not
awarded
by
the
jury,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
it
true
that
the
original
characterization
of
back
pay
as
equitable,
that
that
was
done
way
back
in
'64,
because
there
was
frankly
distrust
in
how
southern
juries
would
deal
with
title
vii?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
congress
created
this
thing
that
they
call
back
pay,
which
one
might
characterize
as
compensatory
whether
it
was
called
back
pay,
and
then
the
court
said,
well,
front
pay
is
the
same,
is
post
judgment
back
pay,
so
the
courts
put
it
under
the
same
heading.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
would
have
to
be
equitable.
otherwise,
there
would
be
a
jury
trial.
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
what
congress
was
trying
to
prevent
in
'64.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
as
back
pay
is
past
loss
of
earnings.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
can't
distinguish
the
two.
i
think
it
is
an
accurate
characterization,
is
it
not,
that
front
pay
is
post
judgment
back
pay?
that
is,
back
pay
is
past
loss
of
earnings,
front
pay
is
future
loss
of
earnings.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
means,
according
to
the
government,
the
same
thing
as
back
pay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
for
loss
of
wages.
one
is
for
past
loss
of
wages,
the
other
is
for
future
loss
of
wages.
they're
both
for
loss
of
wages,
and
if
you
characterize
the
one
legal,
you
could
characterize
the
other
as
legal.
the
government
tells
us
the
difference
here,
why
it's
not
strictly
damages
at
law,
is
that
it's
discretionary
with
the
judge.
they
don't
have
to
be
awarded.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
to
both,
as
to
back
pay
and
front
pay
are
both
discretionary
with
the
judge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
that's
what
all
the
courts
have
said,
courts
of
appeals
have
said,
about
front
pay
since
they
modeled
it
on
back
pay,
that
it
was
discretionary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ripple,
am
i
not
right
in
thinking
that
front
pay
was
first
developed
in
the
context
of
seniority
systems
where
someone
was
denied
the
promotion,
and
title
vii
preserves
seniority
systems,
so
that
person
was
kept
on
the
job
at
the
lower
level,
paid
at
the
higher
rate.
and
the
idea
was
to
speed
up
getting
them
into
the
more
advanced
position.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
what
front
pay
came
out
of,
was
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
thank
you.

cases
involving--
justice
ruth
bader

--is
this
under

because
the

also
has--
justice
ruth
bader

--is
it

justice
ruth
bader

unions
as
well
as
employers
can
discriminate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
your
answer
to
that
was?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
founding
of
the
country--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
might
be
a
suggestion,
but
certainly
it's
nothing
that
a
judge
is
required
to
do.
the
rules
give
the
judge
the
option.
