if

justice
stephen

the
statutory
argument,
as
i
understood
it
on
their
side,
was
not
so
much
that
the
words
other
type
of
relief
is
an
empty
set
without
front
pay.
rather
it
was
that
front
pay
had
been
authorized,
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
now,
very
simply,
if
we're
to
hold
to
the
contrary,
we'd
have
to
say
that
in
this
later
statute,
the
court...
the
congress
changed
the
meaning
of
old
706(g),
which
seems
to
me
fanciful,
or
we
would
have
to
say
that
front
pay
never
was
authorized,
and
all
the
courts
of
appeals
were
wrong,
and
when
we
held
that,
our
reasoning
would
also
say,
probably
back
pay
isn't
authorized
either.
therefore,
if
we
take
that
route,
we
are
tearing
the
statute
apart.
and
then
they
say,
by
the
way,
if
you
want
to
know
what
they
thought,
why
don't
you
just
look
to
the
words
of
the
sponsors
who
without
any
contradiction
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
said,
this
amendment
includes
front
pay,
in
those
words.
all
right.
now,
that
i
take
it
was
their
basic
argument,
and
i
would
like
to
hear
what's
wrong
with
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
my
question
really
as
the
dilemma
they
put
you...
i
think,
are
trying
to
put
you
into
is,
in
giving
that
definition,
are
you
saying
that
congress
changed
the
meaning
of
706(g)?
or
are
you
saying
that
always
was
the
meaning
of
706(g)?
hence,
all
the
courts
of
appeals
holding
to
the
contrary
were
wrong.
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
seems
to
me...
all
right.
that's
what
you
say.
all
right.
then
my
next
question
from
that
would
be,
is
isn't
it
true
that
if
we
write
those
words
on
paper,
that
by
writing
those
words,
we
will
cast
considerable
doubt
on
back
pay
as
well,
because
it
will
suggest
that
that
is
a
legal
remedy
and
not
an
equitable
remedy,
hence
calling
into
play
the
constitutional
requirement
for
a
jury?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
conceptual
distinction
between
the
back
pay
that
you're
going
to
call
equitable
and
the
front
pay
that
in
your
ideal
we
will
write
into
our
opinion
is
not
equitable.
the
conceptual
distinction
is
going
to
be
what,
because
it's
always
possible
that
future
courts
will
try
to
follow
the
logic
of
our
opinion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just...
the
other
part
of
their
argument
is
just
in
case
your
answer
to
this
part,
in
their
view,
has
shown
that
this
whole
thing
is
very
complex,
what
about
looking
to
what
the
sponsors
have
done
for
us,
what
they
happened
to
say,
senator...
i
get
two
senators
and
on
the
house
side,
in
memorandum
signed
by
both
of
them,
and
in
statements,
compensatory
damages
does
not
include
back
pay
or
front
pay.
i
mean,
i
can
understand
not
using
legislative
history
when
it's
ambiguous,
when
there
are
two
sides.
this
seems
to
be
absolutely
clear,
consistent
with
the
language,
without
anybody
saying
to
the
contrary.
so
can't
we
at
least
take
it
as
a
hint
as
to
what
they
were
driving
at?
