david
h.
souter
when
you
speak
of
front
pay,
do
you
mean
an
award
calculated
as
it
was
in
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical?
in
other
words,
you
take...
if
you
have
a
term
contract,
you
take
the
term
of
the
contract,
figure
out
what
portion
of
it
is
unexpired,
and
in
effect,
award
pay
equal
to
what
would
have
been
earned
in
that
unexpired
term--
justice
david
h.
souter
--all
right.
well,
how,
then,
is
front
pay
calculated,
because
that
was
going
to
be
my
question.
i
understand
it
in
his
hypo,
and
you
didn't
take
exception
to
that,
but
you
now
say,
well,
that
isn't
the
way
we
calculate
it.
how
is
it
calculated?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
let's
just
take
that
case.
assume
that.
how
is
front
pay
going
to
be
calculated?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
now,
if
at
the
end
of
the
two
year
period,
there
hasn't
been
a
reinstatement,
is
there
any
further
front
pay
ever
awarded,
or
do
you
say
at
that
point,
it's
over
with
and
any
future
award
would
have
to
be
an
award
of
damages?
justice
david
h.
souter
this
is
after
something
like
the
two
year
period
has
passed?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
that...
i
just
don't
see
how
when
the
front
pay
so
called
becomes
that
extensive,
i
don't
see
how
you
distinguish
it
from
an
award
of
lost
future
earnings
not
attributable
to
loss
of
earning
capacity,
which
is
a
recognized
form
of
damages
at
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
statute
simply
doesn't
make
that
choice.
it
doesn't
say,
is
authorized
or
was
authorized.
it
says
authorized.
justice
david
h.
souter
even
if
you
were
to
lose
on
that
point
and
even
if
it
should
be
determined
that
it
was
subject
to
a
jury
trial,
you
might
very
well
be
correct
about
this
case
as
to
what
congress
intended
to
exclude
from
the
cap
by
the
reference
to
the
word
other.
i
mean,
isn't
that
the
nub
of
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
doesn't
count
toward
the...
what
is
it...
300,000,
whatever
the
cap
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
the
difference
between
going
forward
and
front
pay?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
one
variety
of
front
pay,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
the
reason
i
think
it's
significant
is
we're
not
here
to
determine
this
morning
what
the
ultimate
limit
of
front
pay
by
a
court
of
equity
may
be.
we've
had
some
disagreement
about
it.
what
we're
here
to
determine
is
whether
there
is
any
species
of
an
award
that
an
equity
court
can
make
which
is
customarily
called
front
pay
that
survives,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
your
answer
to
the
question
says,
yeah,
there's
one
variety
that
survives,
and
i'm
using
the
term
going
forward,
but
it's
what
these
other
people
are
using
by
the
term
front
pay,
and
that
seems
to
me
like
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
you
were
saying,
this
is
not
an
empty
set,
if
you
include
front
pay,
and
you've--
justice
david
h.
souter
--given
an
example
of
why
it's
not
an
empty
set,
an
example
of
what
most
people
would
call
front
pay,
not
the
most
extravagant
example
perhaps
but
an
example.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
there
may
be
cases
in
which
we
will
argue.
maybe
it
will
get
to
this
court
as
to
how
far
front
pay
can
go.
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
what
you're
saying
excludes
your
example
from
what
is
meant
by
front
pay.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
concern
is
that
if
we
suggest
that,
in
fact,
back
pay
shouldn't
have
been
awarded,
for
the
same
reason
that
front
pay
shouldn't
have
been,
then,
in
fact,
there
won't
be
any
front
pay
under
your
theory
awarded
by
the
court,
there
won't
be
any
back
pay
awarded
by
the
court.
and
the
cap
will
have
a
very
different
significance
from
the
cap
as
it
was
enacted,
which
was
supposed
to
be
a
cap
that
at
least
excluded
back
pay.
that's
why
justice
breyer
said
that
wrecks
the
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
was
no.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
now
his
concern...
is
there
an
implication
for
that
about
back
pay?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
not?
