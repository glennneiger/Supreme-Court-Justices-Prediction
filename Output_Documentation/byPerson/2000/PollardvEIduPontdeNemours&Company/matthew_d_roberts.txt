mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
a
front
pay
award
under
title
vii
is
not
subject
to
the
cap
on
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
added
by
the
1991
civil
rights
act.
the
1991
act
provided
new
relief
and
generally
capped
that
new
relief,
but
the
act
did
not
cap
remedies
that
were
already
authorized
such
as
front
pay,
which
has
traditionally
been
awarded
when
reinstatement
is
delayed
or
impractical.
and
the
1991
act
expressly
excludes
from
the
cap
damages
relief
authorized
under
section
706(g).
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
your
honor.
at
the
time
congress
drafted
the
1991
act,
which
is
when
it
said
is
authorized,
the
courts
of
appeals
had
uniformly
held
that
front
pay
was
authorized
under
section
706(g),
so
when
congress--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--as
affirmative
action
or
other
equitable
relief.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
i
don't
think
it
has
to
be
characterized
as
other
equitable
relief.
it
could
fall
under
such
affirmative
action
language,
but
even
assuming
that
it
falls
under
the
other
equitable
relief,
there
was
no
legal
relief
that
was
provided
in
1991
that's
a
substitute
for
the
equitable
relief
that
was
already
available--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes.
compensatory
damages
were
provided,
but
congress
was
careful
to
indicate
that
it
meant
those
damages
to
be
in
addition
to
the
relief
that
was
available,
and
that
it
was...
that
the
relief
that
was
available
under
section
706(g),
it
excluded
it
from
the
compensatory--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--that
is
available,
that
is
authorized.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
i
think
our
arguments
are
equally
circular
when
congress--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--it
says
authorized,
and
there
are
two
factors
there
to
consider.
one,
that
the
courts
of
appeals
had
uniformly
held
that
it's
authorized.
and
two...
and
so
congress
incorporated
that
understanding
under
accepted
principles
of
statutory
construction.
and
also
we
know
from
the
legislative
history
for
those
on
the
court
that
are
interested
in
looking
at
it
that
congress
did
intend
to
incorporate
that
understanding.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no.
i
think
it
means
is
authorized,
but
i
think
that
congress
understood...
congress
ratified
the
understanding
of
what
was
authorized,
so
what
was
authorized
became
what
is
authorized,
and--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--and
they're
not
divisible--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes.
i
am
completely
arguing
that.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
in
fact,
we
know
from
the
statute--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--we
know
from
the
statute
that
it
didn't
intend
to
subtract
anything.
in
the
findings
section
which
it
put
in
as
part
of
the
act,
it
said
that
it
wanted
to
provide
additional
remedies.
in
(a)(1),
it
said
that
the
new
relief
was
in
addition
to
the
relief
as
authorized,
and
it
excluded
the
relief
that's
authorized
from
the
new
relief,
and
that's
because
the
whole...
what
was
going
on
is
congress
wanted
to
provide
added
relief
in
the
forms
of
compensatory
and
punitive
damages.
it
knew
that
that
relief
would
be
subject
to
a
jury
determination,
and
there
were
members
of
congress
and
the
administration
that
was
worried
that
those
new
damages,
subject
to
jury
awards,
might
be
excessive,
and
so
they
wanted
to
cap
the
new
relief,
but
there
was
no
concern
about
existing
relief.
nothing
had
been
expressed
that
there
was
excessive
relief
then,
and
congress
had
no
desire
to
touch
existing
relief
at
all.
it
wanted
to
leave
it
alone,
add
something
new,
limit
what
was
new.
and
it
was
correct...
the
courts
of
appeals
were
correct
that
front
pay
was
authorized
under
706(g),
because
it's
discretionary
relief
of
the
same
character
as
back
pay
and
reinstatement.
and
like
back
pay--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--it's
no
closer
to
traditional
damages
than
back
pay.
in
fact,
less
close,
because
damages
are
traditionally
retrospective.
also--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--no,
your
honor.
under
the
current
rule
of
a
breach
of
contract,
you
could,
but
interestingly
enough,
if
one's
looking
back
for
law
versus
equity
and
analyze
back
to
the
18th
century,
the
rule
then
was
that
you
couldn't
get
future
lost
wages
as
damages
for
a
breach
of
contract
because
they
were
too
speculative,
so
you
couldn't
get
them
at
law,
you
couldn't
get
them
in
equity
then.
congress
provided
for
new
remedies
of
the
type
that
don't
have
a
precise
parallel
to
what
was
traditionally
available
at
law
and
equity.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
it
does,
your
honor,
but
it
also
mentions
back
pay
as
an
illustration
in
a
statute
that
allows
the
court
to
order
such
affirmative
action,
including
reinstatement
and
in
a
statute
that
also
allows
it
to
award
other
equitable
relief.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
your
honor.
but--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--there's
never
been
a
question
that
the
back
pay
under
title
vii
is
equitable
relief.
this
court
has
repeatedly
characterized
it
as
equitable
relief,
in
the
albemarle
case,
in
the
burke
case.
in
curtis
v.
lothar,
it
took
care
to
say
that
title
vii's
back
pay
is
equitable
relief.
and,
in
fact,
back
pay...
the
courts
refer
to
back
pay
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
as
equitable
relief.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no,
your
honor.
although
congress's
characterization
of
the
relief,
the
court
has
indicated,
does
count
for
something,
but--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--back
pay
is
a
matter
for
the
court.
there's
no
right
to
a
jury
trial
on
back
pay,
just
as
front
pay
is
a
matter
for
the
court
and
there's
no
right
to
a
jury
trial
on
front
pay.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
to
the
extent
that
juries
might
in
some
cases
do
back
pay,
which
i'm
not
specifically
aware
of,
i
would
assume
that
they're
doing
that
in
an
advisory
capacity,
which
the
court
is
allowed
to
ask
the
jury
to
do.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
back
pay
and
front
pay
under
title
vii
are
both
restitutionary
in
nature
and
intertwined
with
other
injunctive
relief,
and
therefore,
they
are
equitable
remedies.
it's
restitutionary
in
nature,
because
they
both
put
the...
they
require
the
employer
to
pay
the
employee
the
wages
that
the
employer
would
have
paid
the
employee
if
there
had
been
no
discrimination.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
damages
would
apply
even
in
a
tort
case
where
the--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--yes.
it's
true
in
that
case,
but
the
additional
features
that
are
here
are
that
it's
discretionary
with
the
court.
it's
not
automatically
available.
it's
not
available--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
your
honor
suggested
in
your
concurring
opinion
in
albemarle
paper
that
the
discretionary
nature
was
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
it's
equitable
relief
or
whether
it's
legal
relief,
and
we
would
agree
with
that.
discretion
is
a
hallmark
of
equity,
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
noted.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that
it
said
other
relief,
but
it
excluded
all
relief
authorized
under
706(g),
not
just
equitable
relief.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it
is
true
that
in
(b)(2),
congress
did
not
limit
the
relief
that's
excluded
to
equitable
relief,
and
if
you
think
that
706(g)
authorizes
more
than...
relief
that's
more
than
equitable
relief,
then,
yes,
that
would
be
true,
your
honor.
