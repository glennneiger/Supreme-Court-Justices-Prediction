justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
ms.
caldwell,
would
you
tell
me
how
it
works
so
far
as
the
jury's
concerned.
i
think
you
pointed
out
that
from
your
standpoint,
there's
a
real
problem
with
the
respondent's
position
as
to
what
the
jury
should
be
instructed,
but
even
if
your
position
is
accepted,
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
it
works.
is
the
employer
entitled
to
an
instruction
to
the
jury?
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
if
you
find
that
there
is
liability
and
if
you
reach
the
point
of
punitive
damages
and
future
damages,
you
should
not
take
into
account
any
lost
future
earnings.
is
that
the
way
it
works,
if
you
prevail?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
does
it
work?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
as...
for
the
preface,
because
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
employer
would
want
the
jury
to
know
that
they
shouldn't
worry
about
future
pay
and
future
earnings,
and
there
should
be
some
instruction
to
that
effect.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
are
those?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
do
you
call
this...
is
there
a
universe
of
compensatory
and
punitive
damages?
and
then
what's
the
term
that
you
call
these
other
damages?
equitable
damages?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
equitable
relief
but
not
damages?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
jury
award
back
pay?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
it
seems
to
me
back
pay
and
front
pay
ought
to
be
treated
the
same
under
1981a-(b)(2).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
mean
the
courts
are
violating
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
courts
are
violating
the
statute?
i
read
the
statute
the
way
justice
ginsburg
says
it.
just
from
a
statutory
reading,
i
would
think
the
jury
shouldn't
award
back
pay,
but
i'm
pretty
sure
also
that's
not
the
way
it
works.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
happens
with
back
pay,
a)
under
the
statute
as
you
interpret
it,
and
b)
as
a
matter
of
practice
insofar
as
the
jury's
function
is
concerned?
does
a
jury
consider
back
pay?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
a
matter
of
practice,
do
juries
ever
do
back
pay?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
do
you
view
that
as
consistent
with
our
opinion
in
chauffeurs
union?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
but
there
are
smaller
employers.
there's
a
[$]
50,000
limit,
and
i
assume
there
are
many
jobs,
say,
that
pay
40-,
[$]
50,000
a
year,
and
one
or
two
years
of
front
pay
just
could...
front
pay
under
your
theory
would
completely
exhaust
the
cap,
no
matter
how
outrageous
the
employer's
conduct
was,
and
then
there
would
be
no
punitive
damages.
that's
the
consequence
of
your
theory.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
statute
provides
a
jury
trial
for
back
pay
anyway,
so
we
don't
need
to
worry
about
that.
but
the
practical
consequence
of
your
argument
is,
is
that
the
jury
has
to
award
front
pay,
but
the
judge
hasn't
determined
whether
there's
going
to
be
reinstatement
or
not.
he
doesn't
know
if
there's
basic
liability.
he
doesn't
know
what
the
jury's
findings
are
going
to
be
with
reference
to
how
egregious
it
is
on
certain
counts.
i
just
don't
know
how
your
theory's
going
to
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
reassuring,
but
i
just
don't
see
how
mechanically
this
can
work
under
your
view--
