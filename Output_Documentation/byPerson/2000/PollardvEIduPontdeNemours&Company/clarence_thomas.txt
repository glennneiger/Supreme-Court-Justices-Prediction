justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
in
this
title
vii
action
the
district
court
found
that
pollard
was
subjected
to
co-worker’s
sexual
harassment
of
which
her
supervisors
were
aware
and
that
the
harassment
resulted
in
pollard’s
medical
leave
of
absence
and
her
eventual
dismissal.
as
relevant
here
the
court
awarded
pollard
$300000.00
in
compensatory
damages,
the
maximum
permitted
under
the
damages
cap
of
42
u.s.c.
1981a(b)(3).
the
court
observed
that
the
award
was
insufficient
to
compensate
pollard,
but
it
was
bound
by
sixth
circuit
precedent
holding
that
front
pay
which
is
money
awarded
for
loss
compensation
during
the
period
between
judgment
and
reinstatement
or
in
lieu
of
reinstatement
is
subject
to
the
damages
cap.
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse.
under
section
706(g)
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
when
an
employer
engages
in
an
unlawful
employment
practice,
the
court
was
authorized
to
order
remedies
that
included
injunctions,
reinstatement
and
back
pay.
section
706(g)
closely
track
the
language
of
section
10(c)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
under
which
the
national
labor
relations
board
consistently
made
back
pay
awards
up
to
the
date
of
reinstatement.
court's
finding
unlawful
discrimination
in
title
vii
actions
therefore
awarded
the
same
type
of
back
pay
under
section
706(g),
such
awards
for
the
period
after
judgment
are
now
called
front
pay
awards.
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1991,
congress
expanded
the
available
remedies
to
include
compensatory
and
punitive
damages,
but
congress
in
doing
this
also
limited
these
new
damages
under
section
1981a(b)(3).
the
plain
language
of
the
act
makes
clear
that
the
newly
authorized
remedies
were
in
addition
to
the
relief
authorized
by
section
706(g).
since
front
pay
was
a
type
of
relief
authorized
by
706(g),
it
is
excluded
from
the
meaning
of
compensatory
damages
under
section
1981(a)
and
is
not
subject
to
the
damages
limitations.
moreover
there
is
not
logical
distinction
between
front
pay
awards,
when
there
is
reinstatement
and
those
made
when
there
is
not,
and
because
the
text
of
706(g)
does
not
lend
itself
to
any
such
distinction,
front
pay
awards
in
lieu
of
reinstatement
are
also
authorized
under
section
706(g).
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justice
o’connor
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
