justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
caldwell,
can
i
call
your
attention
to
the
text
of
the
statute
again
which
you
cited
us
to?
compensatory
damages
shall
not
include
back
pay
or
any
other
type
of
relief
authorized.
i
assume
that
means
currently
authorized,
not
that
used
to
be
authorized.
and
isn't
one
of
the
problems
with
your
case
that,
assuming
you're
relying
on
the
equitable
nature
of
this
award,
it's
clear
that
you
do
not
give
equitable
relief
where
legal
relief
is
available.
equity
only
steps
in
when
the
law
doesn't
cover
the
problem.
now,
once
upon
a
time,
this
front
pay
may
have
been
available
under
2000e-5(g)
of
the
civil
rights
act
as
equitable
relief,
but
once
you
have
enacted
a
new
provision
for
compensatory
damages,
it
seems
to
me
you
do
not
need
that
equitable
relief
of
front
pay.
you
have
legal
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
do
you
deny
that
if
you
have
legal
ability
to
get
your
future
earnings,
you
cannot
ask
a
court
of
equity
to
give
you
your
future
earnings
without
jury
trial
and
everything
else
that
goes
with
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
used
to
be,
because
under
your
theory,
it
was
equitable
relief,
and
it
was...
and
the
same
money
was
not
available
through
the
law.
but
when
you
have
a
new
statute
that
says
you
can
get
this
compensation,
i
don't
see
any
justification
for
giving
you
front
pay
on
an
equitable
basis.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
looking
at
me,
are
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
said
in
response
to
an
earlier
question
of
justice
ginsburg
that
the
statute...
or
you
agreed
that
the
statute
characterizes
front
pay
as
equitable.
the
1991
statute,
where
does
it
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
call
it
equitable.
it
doesn't
even
call
back
pay
equitable.
it
says,
shall
not
include
back
pay,
interest
on
back
pay,
or
any
other
type
of
relief
authorized
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
'64.
it
doesn't
characterize
any
of
them
as
equitable.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
relief
that
used
to
be
authorized,
but
relief
that
is
authorized.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
equitable
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
leave
affirmative
action
aside.
that
may
be
a
different
question.
but
if
you're
relying
on
the
equitable
relief
portion,
it
seems
to
me
that
with
the
new
legislation,
it's
no
longer
equitable
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
didn't
say,
the
relief
that
was
available.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you're
being
circular.
if,
indeed,
you
can
get
the
compensatory
damages,
you
have
no
need
for
equitable
relief.
you
have
no
entitlement
to
equitable
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
authorized...
you
agree
with
justice
souter.
authorized
means
previously
authorized.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
suppose
that's
wrong--
justice
antonin
scalia
it
specifically
named
back
pay.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
it
doesn't
get
you
very
far
to
say
that
front
pay
no
more
resembles
equitable
relief
or
no
less
resembles
equitable
relief
than
does
back
pay,
because
congress
mentions
back
pay
in
section
706(g)(1).
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that
may
have
been
referring
back
to
reinstatement
or
hiring
of
employees.
that's
certainly
equitable
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
with
or
without
back
pay.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that
congress
can
eliminate
the
right
to
jury
trial
by
simply
denominating
relief
in
the
'64
act
as
equitable
relief?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
seems
like
a
simple
remedy.
we
mistrust
southern
juries,
and
we're
therefore
going
to
call
this
legal
relief,
equitable
relief
so
that
the
defendant
doesn't
get
a
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
that
sense--
justice
antonin
scalia
does
this
really
matter?
justice
antonin
scalia
go
back
to
the
first
one.
i
don't
understand
what
you're
talking
about.
in
promotional
cases--
justice
antonin
scalia
--there's
a
sum
involved.
of
course
there
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
other
than
back
pay?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
front
pay
is
equitable,
so
long
as
it
is
connected
to
the
equitable
relief
of
a
promotion.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
is
not
equitable
if
it's
not
connected
to
the
equitable
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
but
the
other
side
is
going
to
say,
front
pay
is
equitable
relief
if
it's
attached
to
the
equitable
relief
of
the
requirement
of
rehiring.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
only
case
in
which
you
say
it's
not
equitable
relief
is
where
you
award
front
pay
without
any
other
equitable
imposition
upon
the
employer.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
go
back.
so
it's
named.
so
what?
that
shows
you
can
get
it.
it
doesn't
show
whether
it's
equitable
or
not
equitable.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
one
reason
is
back
pay
is
equitable
and
front
pay
isn't
is
that
back
pay
is
named
by
congress.
so
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
president
sign
onto
those
floor--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
bill
required
his
signature,
didn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
he
sign
onto
those
floor
statements?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
house
of
representatives?
were
they
the
sponsors,
these
two
individuals
who
made
these
statements?
were
they
the
sponsors
of
the
bill
in
the
house?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
representative
edwards
did
say
that
in
the
house,
didn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask
you
this
question?
the
case
has
been
argued,
because
this
is
what
the...
your
opponents
have
placed
the
stress
on,
on
the
assumption
that
front
pay
has
to
be
equitable
relief,
or
it
wouldn't
be
covered
under
706(g)(1).
but,
in
fact,
why
can't
it
just
be...
instead
of
being
considered
equitable
relief,
just
be
considered
affirmative
action?
that
phrase,
affirmative
action
as
may
be
appropriate,
which
may
include
but
is
not
limited
to
reinstatement
or
hiring
of
employees
with
or
without
back
pay
or
any
other
equitable
relief
as
the
court
deems
appropriate.
that
last
phrase,
or
any
other
equitable
relief
as
the
court
deems
appropriate,
that
was
added
later
on.
and
the
original
phrase,
affirmative
action
as
may
be
appropriate,
was
in
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
they
copied
that
almost
verbatim
from
the
nlra
as
i
recall.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
under
the
nlra,
the
board
had
awarded
back
pay,
hadn't
it?
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
had
awarded
at
least
a
form
of
front
pay,
hadn't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
without
calling
it
that,
they
had
done
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
don't
maybe
even
need
the
equitable
portion
of
the
statute
to
find
that
what
this
statute
seemed
to
do
was
to
simply
suck
up
what
the
nlra
had
done
and
spit
it
out
into
this
new
statute,
in
which
case
you
get
back
pay
and
front
pay.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
problem
with
it
is
you
will
have
the
worst
of
both
worlds,
because
in
which
case,
there
would
be
front
pay,
and
both
front
pay
and
back
pay
would
not
be
equitable,
but
would
be
legal
relief,
and
you'd
get
a
jury
trial
on
both
of
them.
would
you
like
a
jury
trial
for
back
pay
as
well
as
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
if
i
rely
on
the
national
labor
relations
act
language
which
was
embodied
in
the
original
version
of
this
statute,
why
don't
i
reach
the
same
result
that
your
opponents
say
should
be
reached
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
argument
is
that
this
constitutes
affirmative
action
as
may
be
appropriate,
whether
or
not
it's
equitable
relief,
because
that's
all
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
language
said,
and
under
that
language,
the
nlra
awarded
both
back
pay
and
front
pay.
and
when
congress
adopted
that
language
in
this
statute,
they
expected
courts
to
do
the
same
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
try
to
stick
to
the
words
of
the
statute
rather
than--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
floor
statement.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
acknowledge
the
board
had
done
that...
had
granted
relief
of
that
sort,
and
the
courts
had
upheld
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
some
forms
of
front
pay.
