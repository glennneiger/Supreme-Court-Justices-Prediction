mr.

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
has
got
to
be
not
that
there
can't
be
categorization
by
the
bureau,
but
that
congress
has
limited
the
kind
of
categorization
the
bureau
may
use,
that
congress
has
said
nonviolent
offenders,
and
the
bureau
can't
go
beyond
that
when
it's
talking
about
limiting
the
availability
of
early
release.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well

you...
but
justice

a

forth.
do
all
of
them
get
some
form
of
early
release,
even
though
it's
not
the
full
12
months?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
they
are

as
nonviolent
offenses?

h.
