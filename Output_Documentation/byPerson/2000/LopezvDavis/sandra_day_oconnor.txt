i
take
it
that
discretion
was
exercised
in
the
regulation
adopted
by
the
bureau
of
prisons.
justice
sandra

o'connor
but
how
many
are
eligible
as
nonviolent
offenders,
of
that
total
number?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
how
many
are
there
because
of
nonviolent
offenses
and
therefore
eligible
for
this
program?
