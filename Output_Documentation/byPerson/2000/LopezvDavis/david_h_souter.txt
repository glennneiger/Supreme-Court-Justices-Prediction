h.

oh,
i
didn't
think
they
were
considering
him
as
a
violent
person.
i
thought
they
were
considering
him
as
a
person
who
had
committed
his
crime
while,
i
guess,
carrying
a
gun.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
didn't
under...
maybe
i
misunderstand
the
government,
because
i
didn't
think
the
government
was
saying
that
that
qualified
him
as
a
violent
person,
because
if
that
were
the
case
we
wouldn't
be
talking
about
any
discretionary
category.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
didn't
they
use
the
word
shall,
rather
than
the
word
may?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
say
you
don't
think
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
authorization
is
not
equivalent
to
mandate.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
isn't
this
argument
available
to
just
that
point,
that
it
is
perfectly
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
the
object
of
allowing
the
1-year
reduction
is
to
provide
an
incentive
without
which
the
drug
treatment
program
could
not
be
expected
to
work.
i
gather
it's
a
difficult
thing,
and
there
just
isn't
enough
inducement
for
somebody
to
force
himself
through
this
unless
there
really
is
going
to
be
a
substantial
reward,
and
it
seems
odd
to
me
that
if
that
is
the
object,
that
congress
would
have
wanted,
for
example,
to
exclude
the
entire
class
of
gun
carriers
who
are
obviously
much
more
dangerous
gun
carriers,
i
assume,
when
they're
under
the
influence
of
drugs,
from
the
inducement
that
would
lead,
if
the
statistics
are
correct,
to
a
reduction
in
the
number
of
drug-using
gun-carriers.
why
would
they
exclude
the
inducement
from
all
of
these
serious
categories?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
be,
but
the
concern
of
the
congress
was
that
we
need
an
inducement
to
make
our
program
effective.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
the
conclusion,
but
in
providing
authority,
why
would
they
want
to
give
the
bureau
of
prisons
the
authority
to
exclude
entire
categories
from
an
inducement
which
they
thought
was
necessary
to
make
the
program
work?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
interrupt?
help
me
out
on
the
facts,
then.
i
had
thought
that
there
was
an
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
there
was
a
distinct
difference
between
the
expected
successful
completion
rate
with
an
inducement
and
the
expected,
or
the
actual
successful
completion
rate
without
an
inducement.
what
am
i
thinking,
if
it's
not
in
the
legislative
history?
justice
david
h.
souter
where
was
the
evidence?
was
it
brought
before
the
congress?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
don't
you...
can
we
not
fairly
infer,
might
we
perhaps
not
infer,
be
able
to
infer
simply
from
the
text
itself--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
congress
thought
the
inducement
was
important,
and
if
it
thought
the
inducement
was
important,
why
would
it
want
to
preclude
the
inducement
from
working
in
whole
categories
like
this?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that...
with
respect,
i
don't
think
that
goes
to
my
question.
my
question
is,
why
would
it
want
to
allow
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
eliminate
this
inducement
entirely?
justice
david
h.
souter
for
the
categories...
for
the
categories.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
we've
got
to
look
beyond
this
statute
to
the
fact
that
there
is
a
whole
universe
of
statutes
in
which
the
bureau
of
prisons
is
given
quite
extraordinary
discretionary
powers.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
difficulty
with
that
argument,
that
assuming
that
the
incentive
does
increase
the
success
rate
of
the
scheme,
the
bureau
of
prisons
argument
seems
to
say,
we
would
rather
have
gun-carriers
using
drugs
released
a
year
later
than
former
gun-carriers
not
using
drugs
released
a
year
earlier,
and
that
doesn't
seem
quite
so
rational.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
way
i
just
stated
it,
it
seems
irrational,
and
are
you
saying
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
a
reason
to
say
that
my
factual
assumptions
just
don't
operate,
that
in
fact
the
gun-carriers
just
do
not
seem
to
be
subject
to
this
inducement
and
therefore
it's
better
not
even
to
get
into
the
question
of
early
release?
is
that
their
reason?
