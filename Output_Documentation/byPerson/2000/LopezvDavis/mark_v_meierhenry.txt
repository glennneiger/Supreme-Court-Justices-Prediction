mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
ms.
brinkmann:
this
case
comes
to
you
out
of
the
state
of
south
dakota,
and
i'd
like
to
briefly
put
the
setting
for
all
of
you.
this
is
from
yankton,
south
dakota,
which
was
the
first
territorial
capital
of
the
dakota
territory.
as
a
result
of
that,
certain
institutions
were
created,
one
of
which
was
yankton
college.
it
was
the
oldest
college
in
the
dakotas
and
montana.
it's
now
closed.
it
closed
in
the
1980's,
and
it's
now
a
federal
prison
camp.
that
federal
prison
camp
has
no
walls.
it
looks
like
yankton
college
did
for
over
a
century
until
it
was
closed.
at
that
place
resides
today
chris
lopez.
chris
lopez
came
to
the
yankton
prison
camp
from
the
state
of
iowa.
he
drove
across
the
state
of
iowa
and
was
allowed
to
do
so
by
the
district
court
to
self-report
to
this
college
campus,
now
federal
prison
camp.
we're
here
today
to
talk
about
18
u.s.c.
3621(e).
that
statute
at
the
time
that
chris
lopez
was
a
convicted
person,
before
he
was
a
prisoner,
unambiguously
grants
to
him
an
incentive,
and
before
he
knocked
on
the
door
to
be
let
into
prison
it
said
to
him,
if
you
are
a
drug
abuser,
which
he
admits
he
is,
and
if
you
agree
to
undergo
the
program,
which
he
does,
if
you've
been
convicted
of
a
nonviolent
offense,
congress
has
made
a
deal
with
you.
we
will
allow
you,
if
you
successfully
complete
the
program,
to
be
let
out
of
prison
up
to
1
year
early.
he
had
72
months
to
serve.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no.
i
don't
urge
this
court
that
that
is
the
case,
that
it's
an
entitlement.
the
legislative
history
is
clear
that
that
was
considered
by
congress,
and
congress
did
not
wish
to
make
it
a
right
that
if
you
simply
go
through
the
program
yet
you
led
the
gang
on
the
campus,
or
you
created
other
disciplinary
problems,
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
shouldn't
have
control
over
the
prisoner
while
that
prisoner
was
incarcerated,
but
this
is
something
i'd
like--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--that's
correct.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
justice,
i
think
that's
the
next
case.
what
we're
here
arguing
today
is
whether
chris--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--the
statute
says
may,
but
let's
consider
the
structure
of
it.
3621(a)
is
very
clear.
3621(a)
tells
the
bureau
of
prisons
that
they
may
not
release
a
prisoner
until
the
expiration
of
the
term
imposed,
or
there's
a
good
conduct
section
3624,
so
when
(e)
was
enacted...
and
the
legislative
history
is
congress
also
amended
section
3621(b),
which
says
the
bureau
shall
make
available
appropriate
substance
abuse
treatment
for
each
prisoner
the
bureau
determines
has
a
treatable
condition
of
substance
addiction
or
abuse.
all
right,
they
enact
that.
but
3621(a)
would
not
allow
anyone
to
be
released
early,
so
they
enacted
subsection
(c),
which
is
entitled,
substance
abuse
treatment,
so
section
(e),
your
honors,
had
to
be
amended
to
give
permission
to
the
bureau
of
prisons
that
if
people
took
the
substance
abuse
treatment
there
would
be
some
incentive.
the
congressional
hearings
are
clear.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
don't
think
there's
anything
necessarily
ambiguous
if
you
use
another
meaning
of
the
word,
give
permission
to.
i
urge
your
honor
that
until
the
enactment
of
(e),
if
you
had
substance
abuse
treatment,
if
you
had
an
incentive,
the
bureau
of
prisons
could
not
turn
anyone
loose
under
any
circumstances.
what
i
am
urging
is
a
plain
reading
of
this.
before
mr.
lopez,
so
to
speak,
becomes
a
prisoner,
as
you
read
this
you
would...
it
would
indicate
that
if
you're
a
substance
abuse
user
and
you
go
through
the
program
and
you
substantially
complete
it...
in
other
words,
obey
the
rules
within
the
institution.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
right,
but--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--no,
i'm...
what
happened
in
this
case,
your
honor,
was
that
chris
lopez,
before
he
ever
walked
in
the
institution,
has
been
categorically
eliminated
because
he
has
a
sentence
enhancement
for
preconviction
activity.
he
is
categorically
denied
because
of
something
that
did
not
occur
under
the--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--well,
maybe
i'm
not
being
clear
that--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--that
the
congress
gave
to
the
bureau
of
prisons
certain
discretion,
and
that
discretion
is
over
prisoners,
not
over
creating
categories
of
prisoners.
now,
this
is
not
a
case
where
my
client
has
any
opportunity
to
successfully
complete
for
purposes
of
the
incentive
the
program.
he's
been
shut
out
of
the
program.
to
use
an
analogy,
this
statute
clearly
says
if
you
go
to
drug
class,
and
the
class--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--no.
no,
and
i
don't
want
to
mislead
the
court.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
he's
not
shut
out
of
the
program.
it's
the
incentive.
if
i
infer
that...
it's
the
incentive,
obviously,
we're
talking
about
here.
all
prisoners,
congress
declared...
that's
part
of
our
argument.
congress
declared
that
100
percent
of
all
prisoners
by
1997
should
have
access
to
a
drug
treatment
program.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
but
it's--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--well,
i
could
argue
about,
which
i
think
is
the
next
case,
of
whether
it's
rational
to
consider
mr.
lopez
is
a
violent
person
when
they
put
him
in
a--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--he
had--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--no,
that's
correct,
and
we've
been
through
that
litigation
history
of
them
defining
a
nonviolent
offense
as
a
violent
offense,
which
was
the
eighth
circuit
case
of
martin
v.
gerlinski,
but
the
answer
to
the
problem,
the
problem
is
one
of
who
gets
in
the
classroom.
our
argument
today
is
very
simple.
congress
told
the
bureau
of
prisons
who
gets
in
the
classroom...
all--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--that's
correct.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
it
means
discretion,
but
it
is
not
a
grant
of
discretion
to
categorically
deny
nonviolent
offenders
consideration
for
the
reduction.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
it
could
be.
i
don't
have
a
definitive
answer
of
how
to
run
the
bureau
of
prisons,
except
i'm
here
saying
that
this
statute
clearly
tells
the
bureau
of
prisons
how
people
are
to
get
into
the
program
for
the
purposes
of
the
incentive,
and
that
is
all
nonviolent
offenders
are
to
be
considered,
and
that's
to
occur
after
successfully
completing
the
program.
here
they've
made
that
decision.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
think
they've
done
that.
i
think
that's
the
way
it
practically
works,
unless
they've
had
disciplinary
problems.
i
think
13
percent,
according
to
one
report,
the
triad
report,
indicates
that
they
were
not
allowed
because
of
disciplinary
problems
within
the
institution.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
chief
justice,
that...
i
guess
that
is
essentially
what
i'm
saying.
i'm
saying
that
for
the
purposes
of
the
incentive,
that
everyone
starts
the
program
and
everyone
has
the
opportunity
to
successfully
complete
it,
and
call
that
a
category
if
you
may,
that
it's
while
they're
in
the
institution
that
they
may
be...
their
activities
may
eliminate
them
from
this
category.
it's
not
something
that
occurred
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
which
was
preconviction
activity.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
there
are
two
categories
when
chris...
before
chris...
when
chris
lopez
is
an
offender.
it's
violent,
and
nonviolent.
the
courts
have
considered
that
the
bop's
definition
of
that.
when
he
hits
prison
there
are
two
categories,
violent
and
nonviolent,
and
my
argument
is
that
all
of
those
activities
have
been
considered
by
congress,
have
been
determined
by
congress,
and
they
wanted
to
broaden
the
program.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
because
i
don't
think
they
wanted...
congress
wanted
to
create
a
right
that
just
based
on
completion
of
the
program,
without
regard
to
their
other
activities
as
a
prisoner,
that
just
the
completion
of
that
program
meant
you
were
entitled
to...
and
i
think
that's
the
word,
entitled
to
reduction.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
other
than
that
it
was
clear,
and
i
refer
to
the
legislative
history,
the
report.
it's
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
congress
said
that
this
subparagraph
we're
discussing,
they
use
the
word
authorizes
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
shorten
by
up
to
1
year
the
term
of
a
prisoner
who
successfully
completed
a
treatment
program.
they
saw
it
as
an
authorization'--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--but
the
converse
is
also
true.
authorization
is
not
a
grant
of
power
to
create
categories
which
overrule
the
two
made
by
congress,
violent
and
nonviolent.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
think
the
traditional
standards
that
are
applied
to
good
time
clearly
are
going
to
be
the
type
of
criteria
for
good
time
release
under
section
36...
18
u.s.c.
3624,
would
obviously
still
be
used.
i
mean,
you
have
good-time
release,
which
is
the
only
other
way
you
can
get
out...
basically
you
can
get
out
of
prison
early.
that
was
not
affected
by
this
legislation.
they
added
an
incentive
up
to
a
year.
i
think
you've
got
to
wed
those
two
together,
and
i
think
that's
the
discretion
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
and
must
have,
not
to
create
defining
categories
of
exclusion
before
they
start,
but
you
can
eliminate
the
good
time
type
criteria
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
is
familiar
with,
and
it
would
appear
from
congress,
congress
recognized
that
this
must
be
a
long-term
program,
6
to
12
months,
that
it
was
not
easy,
and
they
said
the
committee
believes
that
such
an
incentive
is
necessary
to
draw
into
treatment
many
inmates
who
may
not
be
willing
to
undergo
a
difficult
program
otherwise.
they
recognize
that
there's
an
800-percent
greater
chance
of
a
drug-addicted
person
committing
a
future
crime,
and
congress--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--i
think
then,
successful
completion.
a
prisoner
would
have
said,
i
successfully
completed
this
program,
i
must
be
allocated
up
to
a
year,
some
period
of
time
off.
it
is
a
right
of
mine,
it
is
a
handshake
congress
made
with
me,
and
i
must
be
given
it,
even
though
i
violated
every
criteria
for
good-time
release,
this
and
this
alone--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--well,
obviously,
obeying
the
rules
of
the
institution,
not
having
contraband,
you
know,
those
type
of--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--exactly.
that's
the
discretion
that
obviously
congress
had
to
give
to
them,
because
part
of
successful
completion
of
a
program
is
to
obey
the
rules
of
the
institution
as
well.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
but
if
you
use--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--well,
maybe
i
misspoke
in
this
sense--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--because
those
are
two
different
things.
i
mean,
successful
completion
of
the
program...
let
me
use
my
analogy
of
the
classroom,
all
right.
a
student's
in
the
classroom.
it's
clear
the
student
has
power
over
the
student
in
the
classroom,
whether
they
complete
the
program,
whether
they
obey,
they're
in
charge
of
grading,
correct,
and
here
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
that.
but
what
the
teacher
does
not
have
control
over
is
which
students
enter
the
school.
in
this
case,
that's
congress.
congress
has
said,
for
the
purpose
of
incentive,
everybody
with
a
nonviolent
offense
has
a
right
to
be
a
student
and
pass
the
course.
now,
here
the
bureau
of
prisons
says,
well,
all
nonviolent
offenders,
yes,
get
to
take
the
course,
but
we've
already
said
you
kids
in
this
row,
you
people
in
this
row
will,
even
if
you
successfully
do
everything
correctly,
you
don't
qualify,
not
based
on
what
congress
said--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--i
think
that
is
consistent,
because
it
is
activities
in
the
prison
over
which
the
bureau--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--that's
correct.
congress
took
care
of
that.
it
created
the
two
categories
and
left
the
administration
to
the
bureau
of
prisons.
the
bureau
of
prisons
here
has
created
additional...
numerous
additional
categories.
in
my
client's
case,
a
nonviolent
offender
drug
case
with
a
sentence
enhancement
for
possession
of
a
firearm.
they've
created
these
categories
in
advance.
i'm
not
arguing
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
doesn't
have
discretion
over
its
institution.
that's
what
the
statute
clearly
says.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
to
the
activities
of
the
prisoner
while
they're
in
prison,
not
to
preconviction
activities.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
nothing
specifically
identifies
it
that
way
as
opposed
to
my
colleague's
way.
to
me,
it
is
rational,
it
is
something
that
makes
sense,
it
is
something
that
when
you--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--well--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--our
argument
is
clearly
this
is
an
unambiguous
statute.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
it
is
my
argument.
i...
what
i
was
going
to
say,
first
we
believe
it's
unambiguous,
but
if
you
get
into
the
determination--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--well,
because
of
the
way
they
constructed
this.
first
of
all,
subsection
(e)
on
substance
abuse
had
never
been
the
law
of
the
land
until
congress
identified
that
this
was
a
serious
problem.
okay.
so
they've
got
to
enact
substance
abuse
treatment,
which
they
do.
they
require
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
treat
100
percent,
or
make
available
100
percent
all
prisoners.
then
they
recognize,
this
is
a
tough
program,
let's
give
an
incentive.
at
first
it
was
to
all
prisoners,
then
it
was...
the
senate
created
two
categories,
violent
and
nonviolent.
then
it
came
down
to
substance
abuse
treatment.
they
added
the
incentive
that
said...
and
they
couldn't
give
them
any
time
off
up
until
the
passage
of
part
b,
period
of
custody,
and
they
created
two
categories,
violent,
nonviolent,
and
they
said
to
the
bureau
of
prisons,
as
we
have
given
you
the
discretion
over
the
years
on
good-time
decisions,
we
give
you
that
discretion
as
well
in
determining
who
successfully
completes
a
treatment
program,
but
we
don't
want
to
go
the
next
step
and
make
it
a
right
of
release.
we
want
the
discretion
for
successfully
completing
the
program.
so
the
common
sense
reading
appears
to
be,
you
don't
have
to,
you
can
take
into
other
considerations,
but
nothing
in
that
step-by-step
process
said,
bureau
of
prisons,
you
may
create
additional
categories
that
categorically
exclude
prisoners
based
on
preconditions.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
believe
so,
and
i'm
assuming
your
question
is
nonviolent--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--for
nonviolent
offenses.
i
think
that's
correct,
that
congress
considered
that.
we
may
not
like
it,
the
court
may
not
like
it.
clearly
the
bureau
of
prisons
doesn't
like
it.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
it
would
mean
that
again
the
door...
in
this
case,
there
is
no
door
to
the
prison
wall,
but
it
would
make
the
difference
between
the
natural
discretion
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
over
the
activities
of
the
prisoners
inside,
as
opposed
to
their
activities
that
occurred
when
they
were
just--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--correct.
my
argument
is
simply
that
congress
created
the
excluding
category,
and
that
was
a
violent
offense,
that
the
bop,
having
created
additional
excluding...
not
based
on
any
activity
in
the
prison,
excluding
categories,
nothing
in
this
act,
legislative
history,
or
the
purpose
of
this,
supports
reducing
the
number
of
prisoners
available
for
the
incentive.
it
is
the
opposite.
it
was
an
inclusive
statute.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
correct.
to
answer
statistically,
and
my
source
is
the
website
of
the
bureau
of
prisons,
there...
as
of
august
of
2000
there
were
63,621
inmates,
or
56.9
percent
of
all
the
inmates
in
federal
prison
were
there
for
drug-related
charges.
the
bureau
of
prisons
also
shows
on
their
website
that
2,633
people
in
1999
got
the
incentive.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
correct,
as
a
convicted
person,
and
maybe
my
definition
isn't
quite
right,
but
i
mean,
when
you...
even
when
you
get
the
chevron,
the
gap
here,
there
is
no
gap.
congress
didn't
create
a
gap.
nonviolent,
convicted
person.
what
they
left
the
discretion
to
is
the
treatment
or
the
actions
of
the
prisoners,
and
those
judgments
within...
once
he
was
prisoner.
i
mean,
the
section
where--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--and
i
don't...
congress
did
not
address
that.
congress
did
not
address
that.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
because
congress,
in
creating
the
incentive--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--i
think
one
of
the
questions
asked
by
one
of
the
members
of
the
bench
in
the
ins
v.
yang
that
my
colleague
brought
up,
some
4
years
ago,
she
was
asked
about
the
authority
of
the
attorney
general,
and
the
question
was,
it's
a
longer
question,
but
the
last
part
was,
would
it
be
within
her,
the
attorney
general's
discretion
to
say,
i
will
never
exercise
my
discretion
in
favor
of
a
waiver,
and
ms.
brinkmann
answered,
yes,
your
honor,
we
believe
it
would
be.
in
the
opinion,
joined
by
all
of
you,
it
said,
it
could
be
argued
that
if
the
attorney
general
determined
that
any
entry,
fraud
or
misrepresentation,
no
matter
how
minor,
no
matter
what
the
attendant
circumstances,
would
cause
her
to
withhold
waiver,
she
would
be
exercising...
she
would
not
be
exercising
the
conferred
discretion
at
all,
but
would
be
making
a
nullity
of
the
statute.
that's
my
argument.
the
bop
is
making
a
nullity
of
the
incentive.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
understand
that--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--but
i
think
it
summarized--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--your
honors,
we
would
ask
the
court
to
overrule
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
find
that
the
discretion
that
the
bop
has
is
attendant
to
within-the-prison
and
not
preconviction
activities.
thank
you.
