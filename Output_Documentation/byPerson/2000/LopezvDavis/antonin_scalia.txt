justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
you're
saying
that
it...
that...
i
mean,
that
doesn't
go
far
enough.
all
you're
acknowledging
is
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
didn't
have
to
give
you
that
benefit
unless
you
successfully
completed
the
program,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
still
maintaining
that
if
you
successfully
complete
the
program,
if
you're
a
model
prisoner
and
everything
else,
you
had
a
right
to
get
that
benefit?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
meierhenry,
how
do
you
propose
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
implement
the
may?
you
don't
want
them
to
use
categories
like,
all
prisoners
who
have
engaged
in
violent
behavior
in
prison.
isn't
that
a
category?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
prisoners
whom
we
do
not
believe
will
be
safe
to
let
out
on
the
streets
even
after
the
program,
isn't
that
a
category?
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you're
being
rational,
if
you're
trying
not
to
be
arbitrary,
you
establish
categories,
so
your
argument
that
may
cannot
mean
you
establish
categories
just
leaves
me
cold.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
exactly
what
you
want
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
do,
to
be
responsible,
not
to
just
arbitrarily
say,
yeah,
you
get
it,
you
don't
get
it.
that's
arbitrary.
that's
irrational.
but
here
they've
tried
to
establish
a
rational
scheme.
what's
the
matter
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that
the
only
precondition
category
that
the
bureau
can
use
is
the
precondition
category
which
is
set
forth
in
the
statute,
and
which
implicitly
excludes
other
pre-imprisonment
categories,
namely,
violent
offender.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
know,
your
argument
that
it
relates
only
to...
your
argument
would
be
a
lot
stronger
if
the
section,
the
relevant
section,
2(b),
didn't
have
the
word
successfully
in
it.
i
could
understand
congress
saying
the
bureau
of
prisons
may
cut
a
year
off
the
term
of
somebody
who
completes
the
program.
then
you
could
say,
well,
the
bureau
can,
you
know,
can
decide
for
itself
whether
this
fellow,
although
he
completed
the
program,
has
really
been
cured
or
not,
or,
you
know,
factors
like
that,
but
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says,
it
may
release
somebody
who
has
successfully
treated...
completed
the
program.
now,
what
factors
do
you
think
the
may
was
intended
to
let
the
bureau
of
prisons
take
into
account?
it
isn't
completion
of
the
program.
no
matter
how
successfully
he
completed
it,
he
still
is
not
entitled
to
it.
now,
what
could
disable
him
from
the
year,
other
than
killing
another
inmate
while
he's
in
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
it
should
have
used
shall.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
they
could
have
said,
you
shall
release
him
if
he
successfully
completed
the
program,
and
you
say
that
successfully
completion
of
the
program
includes
obeying
all
the
rules
in
the
institution.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
certainly
did.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
more
than
that.
i
thought...
i
mean,
come
on,
you're...
you'll
have
to
give
us
some
text
to
hang
on
to.
i
assume
that
what
your
argument
is,
is
the
familiar
argument,
inclusio
unius
exclusio
alterius,
that
in
fact
the
statute
does
identify
one
pre-incarceration
factor
that
will
disqualify
you
from
obtaining
the
year's
benefit,
and
that
pre-incarceration
factor
is
conviction
of
a
violent
crime,
and
by
adding
another
pre-incarceration
factor,
namely
just
merely
possessing
a
firearm,
you're
contradicting
the
implicit
exclusion
of
other
pre-incarceration
factors.
isn't
that
your
argument?
you're
relying--
justice
antonin
scalia
--upon
the
fact
that
a
violent
offender
is
explicitly
excluded.
justice
antonin
scalia
--excuse
me.
why
is
it
unambiguous?
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean
by,
it's
unambiguous.
