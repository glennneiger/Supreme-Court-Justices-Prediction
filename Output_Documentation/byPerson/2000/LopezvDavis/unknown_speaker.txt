unknown
speaker
it
says
may.
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
talking
about
legislative
history,
mr.
meierhenry,
and
those
of
us
who
resort
to
legislative
history
usually
do
so
only
where
something
is
ambiguous.
we're
dealing
with
the
word
may
here
in
section
(b),
and
what
is
ambiguous
about
the
word
may?
unknown
speaker
and
you
may...
your
sentence
may
be
reduced.
unknown
speaker
see,
you've
got
to
deal
with
that
word
may,
mr.
meierhenry.
you're
speaking
as
if
it
said
will
be
reduced.
unknown
speaker
but
that...
that
may
be
a
perfectly
good
argument,
but
it...
and
it
seems
to
me
it
takes
cognizance
of
the
word
may,
that
congress
has
already
decided
the
categories
of
sentences,
but
i
don't
think
just
bobbing
and
weaving
around
the
word
may
does
your
argument
any
good.
unknown
speaker
you're
not--
unknown
speaker
well,
everybody
gets
in
the
classroom.
the
question
is,
having
been...
not
who
is
eligible
for
the
program,
but
who
is
eligible
for
the
early
release
afterwards.
as
you've
said
to
justice
stevens,
there's
no
exclusion
from
the
drug
treatment
program.
unknown
speaker
and
the
reason
there's
no
exclusion
from
the
program
is
that
it
says
that
the
bureau
shall
establish
the
program.
if
you
read
through
3621,
what
is
really...
it
just
jumps
out
at
you,
is
that
it
keeps
using
shall.
shall,
shall,
shall,
until
it
gets
to
the
period
of
custody
section,
and
there
all
of
a
sudden
it
shifts
from
shall
to
may,
which
means
discretion.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
is
there
something
in
the
legislative
history
that
specifically
supports
that
argument?
unknown
speaker
and
they
can
exercise
that
discretion
by
creating
categories
as
long
as
the
categories
are
directed
at
postincarceration
conduct.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
very
sensible
and
logical
theory,
but
what
in
the
statute
or
the
legislative
history
identifies
that
particular
theory?
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question
is
basically
yes.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
is
no.
you
don't
want
us
to
read
may
to
be
shall.
you
want
us
to
read
may
to
mean
may,
but
that
the
scope
of
the
discretion
only
excludes...
only
includes
matters
other
than
pre-incarceration
convictions,
at
least,
right?
unknown
speaker
i
notice
that
in
an
amicus
brief
it's
argued
that
the
regulation
was
promulgated
without
following
the
notice
and
comment
requirements
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
but
i
gather
that
issue
was
not
developed
below
and
is
not
here.
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
other
instances
of
statutes...
are
there
any
instances
of
statutes
where
the
bureau
of
prisons
is
explicitly
authorized
to
make
distinctions
and
decisions
based
on
preconviction
conduct?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
the
bureau
could
switch
back
and
forth
under
that
section
that
you
just
referred
to
and
say,
although
congress
said
all
nonviolent
people
should
be
treated
this
way,
we
think
some
of
these
should
be
treated
the
way
violent
people
are?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
the
same
true
here,
that
congress
has
said
nonviolent
offenders
shall
be
eligible
for
this,
and
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
said
categorically
some
nonviolent
offenders
will
not
be
eligible?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
bureau
says,
we're
not
going
to
release
in
1
year
anyone
guilty
of
a
hate
crime,
violent
or
not,
we
don't
like
people
who
commit
hate
crimes,
could
they
say
that?
unknown
speaker
or
offenses,
you
know,
against
the
united
states
treasury.
it
really
gets
us
mad.
i
mean,
it's
one
thing,
you
know,
harming
other
private
citizens,
but
boy,
it
really
gets
us
mad
when
you
steal
something
from
the
u.s.
treasury,
so
you're
not
going
to
be
eligible
for
1
year.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
why
is
a
firearm
use
not
arbitrary
and
capricious,
but...
and
hate
crime,
is
that
arbitrary
and
capricious,
or
not?
you
say
that's
okay?
unknown
speaker
that's
okay.
unknown
speaker
treasury,
stealing
from
the
treasury
is
not
okay.
that's
arbitrary
and
capricious.
why?
unknown
speaker
oh.
unknown
speaker
so
all
of
those
are
okay.
unknown
speaker
why...
if
that
is
their
premise,
why
would
they
exclude
such
large
categories,
or
entire
categories
of
offenders
from
that
inducement?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
why
are
they
experts
in
saying,
for
example,
hate
crimes
should
be
excluded
but
heroin
possession
might
not,
or
something
like
that?
why
are
they
experts
in
that?
they
don't
even...
the
whole
notion
of
abolishing
parole
suggested
that
the
prison
expertise
is
just
about
what
happens
in
prison,
not
what
happened
before.
unknown
speaker
so
it
would
be
permissible,
i
suppose,
for
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
decide
that
any
person
who
entered
the
country
illegally
would
be
ineligible
for
this
program.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
wouldn't
be
arbitrary.
they
just
have
experience
that
these
people
tend
to
be
recidivists,
or
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
ms.
brinkmann,
can
i
go
back
to
one
of
your
responses
to
the
chief
justice?
when
he
pressed
you
on
the
question
of
previous
convictions
for
violent
crimes
for...
you
mentioned
some
specific
crimes,
and
he
asked,
are
they
nonviolent
crimes,
and
you
said
in
some
instances
they
are,
but
in
some
instances...
or
in
some
instances
they
aren't,
you
said.
but
in
some
instances
they
are.
unknown
speaker
and
i
assume
that
if
we
read
the
may,
or
more
precisely
if
we
read
the
excluded
category
of
violent,
of
persons
in
prison
for
a
violent
offense
as
being
exclusive,
so
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
cannot
add
to
that
category,
the
result,
i
gather,
would
be
that
you
could
have
somebody
who
happens
to
be
in
this
time
for
a
nonviolent
offense,
but
who
was
convicted
five
times
before
of
the
most
heinous,
violent
offenses,
including
murder,
and
that
person
would
have
to
be
released.
unknown
speaker
so
it's
quite
plausible
that
when
congress
was
enacting
this
thing,
that
one
thing
was
obvious,
we
don't
want
someone--
unknown
speaker
--who's
in
there
for
a
violent
offense
to
get
out
a
year
early,
and
there
may
be
some
other
categories,
too.
we
don't
want
to
trouble
to
list
all
of
them.
we'll
leave
the
rest
to
the
bureau
of
prisons.
you're
asserting
that
that's
what
they
did.
unknown
speaker
that's
not
the
point.
i
mean,
we're
all
agreed
that
it
has
discretion.
the
issue
is
not
whether
it
has
discretion
or
not.
it's
really...
it
isn't
the
may
that's
the
issue
here.
the
issue
is
whether
that
other
provision,
namely
the
disqualification
of
non...
of
violent
offenders
is
meant
to
be
exclusive.
that's
really
the
crucial
provision
here.
unknown
speaker
do
we
give
the
bureau
chevron
deference
on
that
question
as
to
whether
that
provision
was
meant
to
be
exclusive
or
not?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
about
the
regulation?
the
whole
regulation
isn't
quoted
in
your
brief,
but
the
part
that
you
have
quoted
on
page
4
refers
to
the
offense
for
which...
the
current
offense
is
a
felony,
b)
that
involved
the
carrying
and
so
forth
of
a
gun,
so
the
regulation
we're
fighting
about
in
this
case
is
one
that
speaks
only
to
the
current
offense.
unknown
speaker
then
is
there
another
regulation
that
disqualifies
people
because
of
their
recidivism
character?
unknown
speaker
3
of
the
appendix?
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
a
violent
offense?
probably
not,
i
guess,
huh?
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
end
runs--
unknown
speaker
who
are
eligible?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's
not
responsive,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
but
then
you're
saying
the
congressional...
congress
was
wrong
in
providing
an
incentive.
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't
needed.
unknown
speaker
clarify
one
thing
for
me.
you
don't
have
to
be
not...
nonviolent
is
only
for
eligibility
for
the
1-year
shortening
of
the
sentence,
but
even
a
person
guilty
of
a
violent
offense
is
eligible
for
the
program,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
to
get
either
in
the
program
or
the
1
year,
you
would
have
to
have
a
history
of
drug
abuse,
so
i...
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--so
i
guess
if
you
were
unfortunate
enough
not
to
have
a
history
of
drug
abuse,
you
can't
get
that
1
year.
unknown
speaker
that's
sort
of
tough,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
a
lot
of
prisoners
are
trying
to
show
they
had
a
history
of
drug
abuse,
right?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you
about
your
response
to
justice
kennedy?
i
suppose
you
could
have
a
theory
that
the
only
thing
that's
explicitly
excluded
is
an
additional
disqualification
based
upon
the
offense
for
which
you're
sentenced,
because
use
of
a
gun
involves
the
very
offense
for
which
he's
serving,
right?
you
don't
have
to
carry
the
burden
of
saying
that
recidivism
or
a
prior
violent
crime
can't
be
taken
into
account,
because
that
is
not
the
condition
that
congress
has
set
forth.
the
only
condition
congress
spoke
to
was
the
very
offense
for
which
you're
sentenced.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
justice
scalia's
question
would
push
it
further
than
that
and
say
it
also,
as
i
understood
it,
would
leave
discretion
to
acts
committed
long
before
you
were
sentenced
this
time.
unknown
speaker
well,
even
if--
--well,
if
congress
didn't
address
it,
why
doesn't
it
fall
within
the...
i
mean,
it
doesn't
really
affect
your
case,
it
but
affects
the
argument
perhaps.
why
doesn't
that
thing
fall
within
the
bureau's
discretion?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
want
to
hold
that
ground?
you
should...
it
seems
to
me
your
position
is,
subparagraph
(6)
would
have
to
go
entirely,
not
just
(6)(b),
but
subparagraph
(4)
would
not
have
to
go
under
that
theory.
right.
unknown
speaker
we
didn't
say
that
argument
was
right.
unknown
speaker
we
just
said
it
could
be
argued,
right?
unknown
speaker
and
you're
proving
that
it
can
be
argued.
[laughter]
