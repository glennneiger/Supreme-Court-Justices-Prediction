john
paul
stevens
--may
i
interrupt
you?
he's
not
shut
out
of
the
program,
is
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
supposing
you
had
a
rule
that
said,
but
there's
a
category
of
students
who
would
normally
get
a
gold
star
but
if
they
threw
an
eraser
at
the
teacher,
they
shall
not
get
the
gold
star,
and
supposing
you
have
here
a
program
that
said,
you
are
entitled
to
the
year,
but
if
you
have
taken
a
poke
at
the
warden
you
shall
not
be
released.
they
just
have
a
category,
anybody
who
takes
a
poke
at
the
warden,
even
though
he's
successfully
completed
the
program,
shall
not
get
the
1-year
benefit.
would
that
categorical
denial
be
consistent
with
the
statute,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
isn't
the
mere
fact
that
it
is
a
category.
your
position
is
that
if
it's
a
pre-incarceration
category,
it's
bad.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
clear
text
just
talks
about
discretion.
the
question
is,
what
is
the
category
of
discretion
in
which
it
can
operate.
you
emphasize
the
expertise
of
the
bureau
of
prisons,
which
it
does
seem
to
me
is
terribly
important.
they're
experts
on
how
well
the
prisoners
have
done
in
prison,
but
are
they
experts
in
classifying
which
people
should
be
eligible
for
this
offense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
those
are
things
that
happen
in...
good
conduct
release
determines
the
conduct
in
prison.
the
furloughs
depends
on
conduct
in
prison.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask,
the
16,800
is
a
large
number,
but
compared
to
how
many
people
in
prison?
justice
john
paul
stevens
about
10
percent,
then.
