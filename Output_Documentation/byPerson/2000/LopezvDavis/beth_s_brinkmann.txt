ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
bureau
of
prisons
permissibly
exercised
its
discretion
under
section
3621(e)(2)(b)
as
reflected
in
its
regulation
and
program
statement.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
the
regulation
and
program
statement
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
promulgated
was
a
statement
of
policy
of
how
the
bureau
of
prisons
will
exercise
its
discretion.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
wasn't
raised
below
nor
in
this
court,
nor
did
the
court
below
address
it
and,
in
fact,
our
understanding
is
that
no
court
of
appeals
has
addressed
that
argument,
but
we
do
believe,
as
we
explain
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief,
that
it
is
not
subject
to
the
notice
and
comment
requirement.
it
could
go
into
effect
as
an
interim
regulation,
because
it
is
a
statement
of
policy,
the
way
in
which
the
bureau
of
prisons
will
implement
the
statute,
and
then
in
each
case
there
is
a
determination
of
whether
a
particular
prisoner
will
be
granted
early
release.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
your
honor,
many.
in
fact,
the
good
conduct
time
statute
that
we...
mr.
meierhenry
was
discussing
is
in
a
neighboring
provision.
it's
in
section
3624.
it
talks
about
the
bureau
of
prisons
granting
good
conduct
time,
and
there
are
two
different
standards,
and
they're
dependent
on
whether
or
not
the
prisoner
was
convicted
of
a
crime
of
violence,
and
in
fact
this
program
statement
also
applies
to
that
statute,
although
there's
no
discretionary
determination,
so
the
crime
of
violence
is
determined
by
the
statutory
definition.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
that
is
a
determination
that
congress
has
made.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
because
of
the
broad
grant
of
discretion
given
the
bureau
of
prisons
by
the
express
statutory
language,
congress
using
the
term
may.
there's
nothing
in
the
statutory
text
to
suggest
that
the
statutory
eligibility
requirements
that
congress
set,
which
are
two,
conviction
of
a
nonviolent
offense
and
successful
completion
of
the
program,
in
any
way
then
eliminate
the
ability
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
consider
other
factors
in
making
their
determination.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
your
honor.
we
think
that
would
be
subject
to
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
review,
but
very--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes,
your
honor.
it
would
be
subject
to
arbitrary
and
capricious
review.
it's
very
similar
to
the
situation
before
the
court
in
the
case
of
ins
v.
yang.
that
was
a
situation
involving
a
waiver
of
deportation
for
persons
who
committed--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--fraud
at
entry.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
think
within
the
broad
expertise
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
and--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--if
the--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--we...
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
arbitrary
and
capricious.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
think
that--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--they
very
well
may
be,
your
honor.
they
would
only
be
subject
to
arbitrary
and
capricious
to
determine
if
there
was
some
lack
of
total
penalogical
reason
for
that.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
several
answers,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
there
is
a
significant
participation
in
the
substance
abuse
treatment
program
of
those
who
are
not
eligible
for
early
release.
more
than
one-third
of
the
prisoners
that
participate
in
this
program--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--congress'
determination
was
that
they
would
give
the
bureau
of
prisons
the
authority
to
grant
that
kind
of
incentive
because,
as
mr.
meierhenry
said,
otherwise
the
bureau--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--the
legislative
history
does
not
support
the
proposition
that
the
incentive
is
necessary
for
participation.
certainly
it
enhances
participation,
but
what
congress
did
was
give
that
authority
to
the
bureau
of
prisons
consistent
with
its
repeated
grant
to
the
bureau
of
prisons
of
broad
authority
in
recognition
of
the
bureau's
expertise--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--in
penalogical
matters.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
there
was
certainly
evidence
that
there
were
state
prison
systems
that
had
this
type
of
incentive,
and
it
was
quite
effective.
congress--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
believe
it
was
in
some
hearings,
and
there
was
some
discussion
in
some
of
the
reports
concerning
some...
a
program
in
new
york,
for
example,
but
congress
did
not
then
mandate
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
grant
early
release
to
everyone
who
successfully
completed
the
program.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
we
don't
believe--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--it
wanted
to
give
the
bureau
of
prisons
the
authority
to
decide--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--the
bureau
of
prisons
has
not
eliminated
the
inducement
entirely--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--only
for
certain
categories.
for
the
very
reason
that
congress
repeatedly
delegates
authority
to
the
bureau
of
prisons
in
these
matters.
categorizing
prisoners
is
the
bread
and
butter
of
the
bureau
of
prisons.
they
do
it
all
the
time.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
point
to
that
to
support
the
clear
text
of
the
statute.
the
statute
does
not
mandate
early
release
for
any
prisoner.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
we
would
disagree
with
that.
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
expertise
on
a
daily
basis
of
categorizing
prisoners,
for
example,
for
security
classifications.
the
first
thing
that
happens
to
a
prisoner
when
they
are
placed
in
the
custody
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
is
a
determination
of
what
kind
of
housing
that
person
should
be
in.
the
main
part
of
that
determination
is
their
criminal
history,
their
past
conduct--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--absolutely,
your
honor.
they
make
decisions
about--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--they
make
decisions
about
furlough.
that's
granted
authority
to
them
by
congress,
about
the
good
conduct
release,
about
placement
in
community
correction
centers.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
also
it
depends
on
the
criminal
history
of
the
individual,
as
does
placement
in
a
community
correction
facility.
we
would
also
point
out
that
the
statutory
text
granting
this
authority
does
not
have
any
restrictions
on
other
factors
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
consider
and,
as
i
mentioned
before,
it's
very
analogous
in
that
respect
to
ins
v.
yang,
where
the
court
recognized
that
although
congress
had
provided
a
statute
that
allowed
the
attorney
general
to
grant
a
deportation
waiver
to
an
alien
who
had
committed
entry
fraud,
that
that
nonetheless
still
allowed
the
attorney
general
to
take
into
account
circumstances
surrounding
the
fraud
in
exercising
their
discretion
whether
or
not
to
grant
that
waiver,
and
that's
particularly
the
situation
here.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
subject
to
arbitrary
and
capricious
review.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
your
honor,
and
all
this
does
is
eliminate
one
incentive
to
the
program.
as
i
mentioned,
there
is
substantial
participation
without
it,
and
the
bureau
of
prisons
in
its
exercise
of
its
expertise
and
broad
authority
has
also
implemented
other
incentives
through
regulation
for
the
program.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
any
prisoner
who
successfully
completes
the
program
is
granted...
and
is
convicted
of
a
nonviolent
offense
is
granted
early
release.
it
may
not
be
the
full
12
months.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
it
is
case-by-case.
except,
it's
incorporated
in
this
categorical
determination
of
successful
completion
of
the
program.
that
incorporates
any
type
of
infractions,
disciplinary
problems--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--after
all
of
that
is
completed,
yes,
that
is
when
early
release
is
granted.
it
may
not
be
up
to
12
months,
because
in
the
exercise
of
discretion
the
bureau
of
prisons
tempers
the
amount
of
early
release,
depending
on
the
completion
of
the
program.
for
example,
if
a
prisoner
is
sent
to
the
community
corrections
facility
the
bureau
ensures
that
they
complete
the
6-month
transitional
drug
abuse
program
there,
and
that
may
cut
into
their
year
of
early
release.
they
may
end
up
only
getting
6
months
of
early
release,
for
example.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
if
they
successfully
complete
the
program,
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
other
categories,
of
course,
as
we
point
out
in
the
brief,
that
are
categorically
denied
early
release,
and
for
similar
reasons
in
the
expertise
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
determined
that
they
pose
a
greater
threat
to
the
community
when
they're
released,
prisoners
with
prior
convictions
for
serious
crimes
such
as
homicide,
aggravated
rape
and
assault,
and
also
prisoners
whose
current
offense
involves
sexual
abuse
of
children.
those
are
also
categorical
determinations,
and
it
is
consist--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--in
some
instances
they
may
be,
your
honor,
and
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
set
forth
this
regulation
in
order
to
further
its
purpose
of
consistency
and
even-handedness
in
applying
this
program,
and
to
give
fair
notice
to
prisoners.
i'd
also
like
to
emphasize
that
looking
at
the
prior
convictions
and
circumstances
surrounding
an
offense,
it's
reasonable
when
predicting
and
looking
at
the
threat
to
the
danger
of
the
community,
because
in
fact
that
is
all
conduct
that
occurs
in
the
community.
one
can
say
it's
more
rational,
perhaps,
to
look
at
a
prisoner's
use
of
a
gun
when
they
were
in
a
community
when
deciding
what
their
conduct
may
be
when
they
return
to
the
community
as
a
postinfraction
during
their
term--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--we
think
that's
precisely
the
type
of
expertise,
though,
that
congress
relies
on
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
bring
to
this
type
of
decision.
that's
why
congress
did
not--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--their
theory,
as
they
set
forth
in
the
program
statement,
is
that
the
use
of
a
gun
in
the
course
of
a
drug
transaction
increases
the
likelihood
of
use
of
force
and
violence,
and
for
that
reason
granting
early
release
is
not
appropriate.
the
full
deterrent
effect
of
serving
the
entire
sentence
is
something
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
determined
is
appropriate
in
those
types
of
cases.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
precisely,
your
honor.
it's
the
situation
where
the
instant
offense
is
a
conviction
for
money
laundering
of
the
hit
man
who
has
many,
perhaps
even
a
series
of
convictions,
whether
in
the
federal
or
the
state
system.
that's
exactly
the
type
of
categories
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
looked
to
in
deciding
to
exercise
its
discretion--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
absolutely,
your
honor,
and
that
is
totally
supported
by
the
text,
because
of
the
point
i
think
your
honor
and
some
of
the
other
members
of
the
court
made,
when
you
look
at
the
language
of
the
neighboring
statute
using
the
word
shall
to
mandate
the
provision
of
the
substance
abuse
treatment
program.
the
bureau
of
prisons
does
not
have
discretion
to
not
make
available
the
substance
abuse
program
to
prisoners
who
are
eligible,
and
the
terminology
in
the
statute
for
that
is
someone
who--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--and
we
believe
it's
clearly
not,
your
honor.
that
sets
a
statutory
eligibility
requirement,
a
threshold,
but
there's
no
indication
that
then
the
congress
intended
to
impose
restriction
on
factors
that
may
be
related
to
that
eligibility.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
we
believe
so,
your
honor,
and
we
believe
that
it's
regulation
here
is
a
authoritative
statement
of
its
implementation
of
the
statute.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
your
honor.
petitioner
had
actually
provided
the
full
regulation
in
their
brief.
it's
in
the
blue
brief,
the
appendix,
beginning
on
page
3,
and--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes,
and
carrying
over
to
page...
well,
page
3,
you
have
to
see
that
(a)(1)
explains
that
in
the
exercise
of
discretion
the
director
of
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
is
deeming
certain
categories
of
inmates
not
eligible
for
the
early
release.
the
first
one
is
ins
detainees,
then
we
go
on
to
pretrial
inmates,
contractual
boarders,
all
of
which
are
ineligible
for
reasons
that
are
clear
to
the
bureau
of
prisons
in
their
expertise
of
the
management
of
prisons.
subparagraph
(4)
talks
about
inmates
who
have
a
prior
felony
or
misdemeanor
conviction
for
homicide,
forcible
rape,
robbery,
or
aggravated
assault,
or
child
sexual
abuse
offenses.
the
next
category
has
to
do
with
prisoners
who
are
ineligible
for
the
community-based
corrections
program.
then
we
get
down
to
subcategory
(6),
which
talks
about
inmates
whose
current
offense
is
a
felony,
and
then
there
are
four
subcategories
of
those,
one
being
the
subcategory
at
issue
here,
a
felony
that
involved
the
carrying,
possession,
or
use
of
a
firearm
or
other
dangerous
weapon.
one
of
those
other
categories
are
offenses
that
are
felony...
that
involve
sexual
abuse
committed
against
children.
the
other
two
have
to
do
with
the
actual
attempt
or
threatened
use
of
physical
force.
the
other
is
a
felony
that
by
its
nature
or
conduct
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
force
against
that
person
or
property.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
set
forth
these
was
to
ensure
that
it
had
exercised
its
discretion
in
a
regulatory
manner
because
of
problems
that
had
arisen
with
inconsistent
statutory
interpretations
by
the
lower
federal
courts,
which
create
inordinate
problems
for
the
bureau
of
prisons
because
of
the...
not
only
that
they
have
personnel
in
different
areas
of
the
country
implementing
different
standards,
but
also
prisoners
are
frequently
transferred
between
different
circuits.
so
they
set
forth...
and
as
pointed
out,
some
of
these
offenses
could
also
be
covered
under
the
violent
offense
category,
but
they
wanted
to
set
forth,
out
of
fairness
to
prisoners
also,
notice
beforehand,
and
also
for
the
even-handed
administration
of
the
incentive.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
we
do
believe
that
the
bureau
of
prisons'
initial
regulation
actually
was
a
permissible
regulation.
they
ran
into
problems
in
some
circuits
because
the
courts...
because
of
their
reference
to
924(c).
the
court
then
held
that
they,
the
bureau
of
prisons,
could
not
look
to
anything
beyond
the
elements
of
the
offense.
that
was
really
the
problem
there.
so
the
bureau
of
prisons
came
back
and
decided
to,
as
a
matter
of
discretion,
exercise
that
authority
and
make
clear.
we
don't
think
there's
anything
impermissible
about
that.
in
fact,
it's
consistent
with
well-established
administrative
law
principles
that
a
agency's
hands
cannot
be
tied
because
of
the
inartful
drafting
of
a
prior
regulation.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
any
kind
of
drug
offenses,
your
honor,
that
don't
involve
the
use
or
carrying
of
a
firearm,
certainly,
and
all
kinds...
i
mean,
this
doesn't
just
have
to
be
drug-related
offenses.
i
can
tell
you,
there's
a
substantial
participation,
your
honor.
the
bureau
of
prisons
informed
me
that
currently
there
are
approximately
16,800
prisoners
participating
in
the
program
at
one
of...
either
on
the
wait
list,
in
the
residential
program,
or
in
the
transitional
program
currently,
and--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
your
honor.
30
percent--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--but
your
honor,
at
least
one-third
of
those
prisoners
are
not
eligible
for
early
release.
the
real
incentive
in
this
program,
your
honor,
is
a
life
change,
and
that
in
fact--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor,
it
is
an
incentive.
it's
a
useful
tool
for
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
use
in
implementing
the
drug
abuse
program
and,
as
i
mentioned
before,
the
bureau
of
prisons
has,
in
fact,
by
regulation
promulgated
other
incentives
having
to
do
with
the
prisoner
being
able
to
obtain
the
maximum
time
in
a
community
correction
facility.
there
are
financial
incentives
for
completion
of
the
various
phases
of
the
program.
so
that
is
the
bureau
of
prisons
implementing
the
program
and
fulfilling
the
mandate
that
they
make
available
this
program
to
any
prisoner
who
has
a
substance
abuse
program
and
wants
to
participate
in
it.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
approximately
130
to
140,000--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--is
the
current
population.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
out
of
the
130
to
140--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
don't
have
that
information.
that
was
not
ascertainable,
and
i
also
must
say,
your
honor,
out
of
that
number
you'd
have
to
winnow
it
down
to
the
prisoners
who
are
actually
statutorily
eligible
under
(e)(1),
which
means
a
prisoner
who
has
a
documented
substance
abuse
program
and
who
are
willing
to
participate
in
this
very
rigorous
program.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
and
they're
also
eligible
for
the
other
incentives
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
provides.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
to
be
able
to
get
into
the
program,
that's
correct.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
true,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that
was
congress'
determination,
because--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--the
bureau...
unfortunately,
there
is
a
very
high
percentage
of
federal
prisoners
that
do
have
problems,
but
again
it
goes
back
to
the
determination
that
congress
wanted
to
provide
the
bureau
of
prisons
with
this
authority
that
it
could
grant
this
early
release.
the
bureau
of
prisons
does
not
have
any
authority
or
discretion
without
this
statutory
provision
to
grant
anyone
early
release.
if
there's
nothing
further,
your
honor.
