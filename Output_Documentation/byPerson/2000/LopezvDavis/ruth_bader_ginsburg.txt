justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
counsel,
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
the
statute
says
the
bureau
of
prisons
may
reduce
the
sentence
up
to
1
year.
it
doesn't
say
you
have
a
right
or
an
entitlement,
does
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
does
the
statute
say?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
clarify
two
things?
if
you
are
now
leaving
your
argument
that
all
people
who
complete
the
program
successfully
and
are
nonviolent
offenders
must
be
given
this
reduction,
if
you
are
leaving
that,
and
shifting
to
an
each
individual
is
entitled
to
an
individual
determination,
not
a
categorical
exclusion,
if
you're
doing
that,
then
mustn't
the
bureau
do
the
same
thing
for
nonviolent
offenders
who
weren't
carrying
any
weapon?
i
mean,
if
it's
going
to
be
a
one-by-one
examination
for
a
defendant
that
fits
in
your
client's
category,
wouldn't
it
also
be
one-by-one
for
anyone?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
could
they
make
a
decision
categorically
that
all
people
who
are
nonviolent
offenders
who
aren't
carrying
a
firearm
will
get
the
reduction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
how
you
would...
the
statute
in
your
view
would
have
meant
anything
different
if
the
word
may
had
been
replaced
by
the
word
shall
or
must?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
are
those
criteria?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
if
you
had
contraband
you
would
not
have
successfully
completed
this
program.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
bureau
of
prisons
had
a
categorical
rule
that
extreme
recidivists,
someone
who
had
been
convicted
four
times,
has
been
in
and
out
of
prison,
that
four-time
offenders
will
not
be
released
early,
would
that
be
impermissible?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so...
but
essentially
your
argument
then
comes
down
to
the
may
means
shall.
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
if
the
word
shall
had
been
used,
or
must,
that
in
this
context
may
means
shall
or
must.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
brinkmann,
may
i
ask
how
the
bureau
of
prisons
implements
this
with
respect
to
possession
of
drug
offenders
who
do
not
carry
firearms?
is
that
also
categorical?
that
is,
does
everyone
who
commits
a
nonviolent
offense
without
using
a
gun,
who
successfully
completes
the
program,
do
they
as
a
category
get
a
reduction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
is
that?
you've
just
answered
my
first
inquiry
about,
it's
discretion
both
ways,
exercises
discretion
to
have
categories
of
inclusion,
exclusion.
if
you
fit
that
category
you
get
released,
so
it's
not
that
they're
doing
it
case-by-case
for
people
who
commit
nonviolent
offenses
without
guns,
but
categorically
for
the
other.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
we
passed
that
hurdle.
everyone--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
argument
that's
made
is,
because
a
couple
of
circuits
said
the
bureau
was
wrong
initially
when
it
typed
people
who
carried
guns
in
connection
with
possession
offenses,
drug
possession
offenses,
typed
them
violent
and
then
said
the...
and
then
the
prison
responded,
bureau
of
prisons
responded
by
saying,
we're
not...
no
longer
categorizing
them
as
violent
offenders,
we're
exercising
our
discretion
to
exclude
them.
that
could
be
characterized
as
trying
to
do
an
end
run
around
the
court
of
appeals
decisions
that
said,
these
crimes
are
not
crimes
of
violence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
congress
has
authorized
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
reduce
by
up
to
one
year,
the
prison
term
of
an
inmate
who
successfully
completes
a
drug
abuse
program.
congress
specified
however,
that
only
inmates
convicted
of
non-violent
felonies
are
eligible
for
this
dispensation.
the
bureau’s
implementing
regulation
places
several
class
of
prisoners
in
the
ineligible
category
among
them,
prisoners
whose
current
offence
is
a
felony
attended
by
the
carrying
possession
or
use
of
a
firearm.
the
question
presented
in
this
case,
when
the
offense
of
conviction
is
non-violent,
drug
distribution
for
example,
is
the
bureau’s
exclusion
of
firearms
carriers
from
consideration
for
early
release
a
permissible
exercise
of
the
discretion
congress
lodged
in
the
bureau?
our
answer
is
yes,
and
we
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
petitioner
christopher
lopez
was
convicted
of
the
federal
offence
of
possession
of
methamphetamine
with
intent
to
distribute
the
drug.
his
sentence
was
elevated
two
levels,
pursuant
to
the
applicable
sentencing
guideline
because
he
possessed
a
firearm
in
connection
with
his
drug
offence.
in
prison,
lopez
requested
substance
abuse
treatment,
the
bureau
found
him
eligible
for
the
treatment
program,
but
ineligible
for
early
release
because
of
his
firearm
carriage.
lopez
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
challenging
the
bureau
regulation
that
categorically
denied
early
release
to
all
inmates
whose
offense
involved
possession
of
a
dangerous
weapon.
the
district
court
granted
lopez’s
his
petition,
but
the
eighth
circuit
reversed,
holding
that
the
bureau’s
denial
of
early
release,
the
firearm
carriage
was
a
permissible
exercise
of
the
desecration
congress
entrusted
to
the
bureau.
lopez
urged
that
all
prisoner
convicted
of
non-violence
crimes
who
successfully
complete
drug
abuse
programs
qualify
under
the
governing
statute
were
individualized
early
release
determinations.
he
further
urges
that
in
making
individualized
determinations
the
bureau
may
take
into
account
only
postconviction
conduct
not
preconviction
conduct,
here,
carrying
a
dangerous
weapon
in
connection
with
the
commission
of
an
offence.
the
controlling
statute,
as
we
read
it,
gives
the
bureau
discretion
to
grant
or
deny
a
sentence
reduction
upon
successful
completion
of
a
drug
treatment
program
and
leaves
open
the
manner
in
which
that
discretion
is
to
be
exercised.
under
the
guiding
precedent
declared
in
the
chevron
case
where
congress
has
enacted
a
law
that
does
not
answer
the
precise
question
at
hand
there
is,
but,
one
question
for
the
court
to
decide,
in
this
case
whether
the
bureau,
the
agency
empowered
to
administer
the
early
release
program,
has
filled
the
statutory
gap
in
a
reasonable
manner.
we
hold
that
the
bureau
acted
reasonably,
both
in
ruling
categorically
and
in
making
preconviction
conduct,
here
gun
carriage,
the
bureau
need
not
to
blind
itself
to
preconviction
conduct
that
the
agency
reasonably
views
as
jeopardizing
life
and
limb,
and
even
when
a
statutory
scheme
requires
individualized
determinations,
which
this
scheme
in
our
judgment
does
not,
the
decision
maker
may
relay
on
rule
making
to
resolve
occurring
issues
that
may
be
settled
fairly
and
efficiently
that
way.
the
case-by-case
consideration,
lopez
seeks
we
note
as
applied
in
diverse
prisons
across
the
country
in
thousands
of
cases
each
year,
could
invite
favoritism,
disunity
and
inconsistency.
in
sum,
we
hold
that
the
bureau
reasonably
determined
by
regulation
that
an
inmate’s
prior
involvement
with
firearms
in
connection
with
the
commission
of
a
felony
suggest
his
readiness
to
resort
to
life
endangering
violence
and
therefore
appropriately
marks
him
ineligible
for
early
release.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
kennedy
joined.
