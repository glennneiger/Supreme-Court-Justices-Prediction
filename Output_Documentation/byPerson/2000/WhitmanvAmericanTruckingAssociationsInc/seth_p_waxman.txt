mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
principal
issues
in
this
first
case
and,
with
the
court's
leave,
i'll
address
each
in
turn.
first,
the
clean
air
act
does
not
violate
the
nondelegation
doctrine.
the
act
prescribes
the
following:
epa
must
set
national
ambient
air
quality
standards
for
a
limited
set
of
ubiquitous
pollutants.
the
standards
must
be
requisite
to
protect
public
health
with
an
adequate
margin
of
safety.
they
must
be
based
on
criteria
that
reflect
the
latest
scientific
knowledge
about
the
identifiable
effects
of
the
pollutant
in
the
ambient
air,
and
the
administrator
must
consult
an
independent
body
of
scientific
experts
and
explain
any
significant
departure
from
its
recommendations.
for
30
years,
successive
administrators
have
applied
the
act's
terms
consistently.
requisite
means
sufficient,
but
not
more
than
necessary
to
protect
public
health
with
an
adequate
margin
of
safety.
public
health
addresses
not
all
biological
effects,
and
not
even
all
medical
effects,
but
only
those
adverse
health
effects
that
threaten
populations.
and
identifiable
effects
means
those
that
are
shown
to
exist
not
hypothesized.
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--they
do;
that
is,
the
legislative
history...
says
that
they
must
be
adverse,
which
the
administrator
and
the
court
of
appeals
means
medically
significant.
now,
they
have
to
be
also
medically
significant
to
a
sufficient
population
to
constitute
a
public
health
effect.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
constitution
requires
more,
specifically
the
articulation
of
what
it
called
a
determinate
criterion
to
govern
the
setting
of
the
precise
standard
for
each
pollutant.
that
is
contrary
to
this
court's
precedents
which
require
that
the
court
articulate
only
an
intelligible
principle
or,
as
the
court
has
otherwise
put
it,
that
the
court
delineate
the
general
policy,
the
public
agency
that
is
to
accomplish
it,
and
the
boundaries
of
the
delegated
authority.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
believe
i
can
say
it
in
one
sentence,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
for
a
discrete
set
of
pollutants
and
based
on
published
air
quality
criteria
that
reflect
the
latest
scientific
knowledge,
epa
must
establish
uniform
national
standards
at
a
level
that
is
requisite
to
protect
public
health
from
the
adverse
effects
of
the
pollutant
in
the
ambient
air.
now
that,
in
our
view,
means
that
congress
has
made
the
fundamental
policy
choices,
and
it
is
also
articulated
both
substantive
and
procedural
constraints
on
epa's
application
of
the
specified
standard.
the
constitution
simply
does
not
require
more.
there
is
a
second
issue
in
the
case,
if
i
can
outline
what
our
position
is.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no.
absolutely
not.
and
let
me
answer
your
direct
question
first,
and
if
i
can
and
if
it
would
be
helpful
to
the
court,
quickly
outline
the
steps,
the
serial
steps,
that
the
agency
must
go
through
every
time
the
administrator
has
to
modify
it.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
agency
looks
first
based
on
the
criteria
documents
at
the
identifiable
effects.
those
are
effects
that
science
has
identified
will
happen
to
people
not
hypothesized
risks
about
what
might
happen.
that's
number
one.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
number
two,
it
then
looks
at
whether
those
demonstrated
effects
rise
to
the
level
of
medical
significance,
not
whether
they
are...
there
is
some
effect
on
the
biology
of
a
cell,
but
whether
it
rises
with
respect
to
any
person
to
the
level
at
which
a
physician
applying
in
this
case
the
standards
of
the
american
thoracic
society
would
determine
that
that
person
requires
treatment,
that
that
person,
if
you
will,
is
ill
or
manifesting
a
significant
medical
symptom.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
requisite
has
been
defined
by
the
agency,
and
it's
supported
both
by
the
legislative
history
and
the
d.c.
circuit,
to
mean
sufficient,
but
not
more
than
necessary.
that
is,
the
congress
could
not
have
been
clearer
that
zero
risk
or
background
levels
of
a
pollutant,
that
is
levels
that
exist
in
the
ambient
air
without
man-made
activity,
is
not
what
the
administrator
is
aiming
for
or
what
the
act
is
designed
to
protect.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
perhaps
i...
if
i
may,
perhaps
i
can,
to
answer
your
question
by
reference
to
either
or
both
of
the
two
pollutants
that
are
at
issue
here.
with
respect
to
particulate
matter,
for
example,
there
was
a
preexisting
standard
that
was
set
in
1987.
the
agency
pursuant
to
the
act's
requirements
that
the
standards
be
reviewed
every
five
years
in
light
of
the
latest
scientific
knowledge
went
back
and
collected
all
of
the
medical
and
scientific
study
and
prepared
them
in
a
criteria
document,
which
is
a
multivolume
set
that
is
reviewed
by
casac,
the
independent
advisory
committee,
which
agreed
that
it
was
what
it
called
the
best
ever
compilation
of
the
health
effects
of
small
particulate
matter
on
public
health.
the
epa
then
created
a...
what
is
called
a
staff
paper.
the
staff
paper
distills
the
science
and
organizes
the
data
in
a
series
of
recommendations.
that,
too,
was
reviewed
by
casac,
which
agreed
that
the
ranges
of
concentrations...
and
this
i
think
is
what
you're
getting
to...
provided
the
appropriate
parameters
for
the
administrator's
decision.
now,
with
respect
to
particulate
matter,
the
staff
recommended,
and
casac
agreed,
that
it
was
important
to
separately
measure
particulate,
fine
particulate
matter;
that
is,
matter
that
is
equal
to
or
less
than
25
micrograms
per
cubic
meter.
and
if
the
staff
with
casac's
approval
set
both
the
upper
bound
and
the
lower
bound
for
the
administrator's
decision
based
on
what
the
science
revealed.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
a
couple
of
reasons,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
first
of
all,
as
i
think
we'll
probably
address
in
some
detail
in
the
next
hour,
the
epa
uses
costs
and
feasibility
standards
in
many,
many
of
the
things
that
it
does,
and
it
uses
the
information,
this
information
that
casac
provides
for
that
purpose.
for
example,
in
all...
the
act
essentially
creates
a
two-part
process.
the
first
part
is
the
setting
of
these
national
standards
that
set
a
floor
for
ambient
air
across
the
whole
country
and
do
not
apply
of
their
own
force
to
any
source
of
polluting,
whether
it's
me
driving
my
car
or
the
utility
plant
that
generates
my
power.
the
second
part
of
the
act
is
implementation;
that
is,
how
do
you
go
about
achieving
these
standards,
and
the
states
and
epa
have
vast
authority
and
discretion
to
determine
how
that's
done,
and
costs
and
other
implementation
factors,
like
technological
constraints,
are
used
at
that
point
to
determine
what's
reasonable.
this
court
in
union
electric
in
1976
pointed
out
that
costs
and
technological
considerations
are
amply
used
in
the
implementation
process,
so
long
as
they
don't
avoid
it.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes,
since--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
legislative
history
and
the
text
of
the
'70
act
are
absolutely
clear,
and
the
epa
and
the
d.c.
circuit
have
been
unanimous
for
30
years
that
in
the
first
part
of
the
clean
air
act,
that
is
in
setting
the
standards,
the
epa
is
to
consider
only
what
the
criteria
documents
reveal
as
the
effects
on
public
health
and
welfare
of
the
pollutant
in
the
air,
and
that
costs
are
determined
at
the
implementation
phase
by
the
states,
by
epa,
and
by
congress.
now,
your
point
about
casac,
i
think
is
very
important
to
understand.
the
casac
was
created
in
the
1977
amendments,
and
it
was
directed
to
do
two
things,
and
it's
reflected
at
pages
112-a
and
113-a
of
the
appendix
to
our
petition.
first,
in
109(d)(2)(b)
it
is
told
to
review
both
the
criteria,
which
i
was
just
discussing,
and
the
national
ambient
air
quality
standard
that
epa
proposes
in
light
of
its
scientific
knowledge
and
what
the
criteria
document
reveals,
and
that
is
part
of
the
naaqs
standard-setting
process,
and
in
this
case
the
casac
issued
what
they
called
closure
letters,
both
with
respect
to
the
criteria
documents
on
pm
and
ozone
and
with
respect
to
the
staff
papers
on
particulate
matter
and
ozone.
you
have
directed
my
attention
to
a
separate
section
of
the
statute
which
says
that
such
committees
shall
also,
and
then
it
lists
a
series
of
things
that
it
should
do.
that
section,
the
section
that
relates
to
implementation
technologies,
et
cetera
relates
to
the
implementation
process
of
the
standards.
the
ep...
for
example,
with
respect
to
the
pm
and
ozone
standards,
the
casac
has
not
yet
issued
any
of
that
information
because
the
agency
has
not
yet
either
begun
to
implement
the
eight-hour
standard
or
the
2.5
standard,
or
indicated
in
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
how
it
will
go
about
doing
that.
the
provision
that
you
have
questioned,
justice
o'connor,
ties
in
perfectly
with
the
provision
in...
also
in
section
7409,
i
can't
remember
which
subsection
it
is,
which
requires
the
ep...
or
maybe
it's
section
7408.
in
any
event,
i'll
explain
to
you
what
i
have
in
mind.
the
1970
act,
which
required
epa
to
set
national
standards
for
the
first
time
under
the
1967
act,
they
were
set
by
the
states.
in
the
1967
act,
the
states
were
told
to
set
them
by
reference
to
two
things
that
epa's
predecessor,
hew,
would
supply
them.
the
first
was
the
criteria
document
accumulating
the
science
data
on
health
effects,
which
is
the
same
thing
we
have
today.
the
second
thing
was
a
description
of
costs,
pollution
control
technologies,
feasibility,
et
cetera,
and
the
'67
act
told
the
states
that
they
were
to
conform
their
standards
to
both
of
those
documents.
now
in
1970,
the
congress
did
two
very
significant
things.
first
of
all,
it
gave,
it
made
the
requirement
to
set
standards
mandatory
and
upon
epa,
that
is,
on
a
national
basis,
so
we
would
have
a
national
floor.
then
the
second
thing
which
is
really
significant
to
your
question
is
that
it
separated
out
the
two
things
that
epa
was
collecting
and
providing.
and
it
provided
that
epa
was
to
still
do
the
criteria
documents,
but
that
the
naaqs,
the
national
standards,
would
be
based
on
those
criteria
documents
only,
and
the
act
provides
that
at
the
time
that
the
criteria
documents
are
issued,
epa
shall
also
provide
to
the
states
and
to
congress
information
about
costs,
implementation,
and
available
control
technologies
so
that
they
can
use
that
information
in
the
standard-setting
process
that
this
court
reviewed
in
union
electric.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
can
talk
until
interrupted,
but
i
would
prefer
to
answer
questions,
of
course.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
do
believe
it
is
their
main
point,
and
it
is...
it
fundamentally
misconceives
both
what
the
act
requires
and
what
every
administrator
since
1970
has
done.
as
i
was
saying
before,
when
the
administrator
gets
the
decision,
it
gets
a
staff
report
validated
by
casac
that
shows
the
upper
bound
and
lower
bound
of
where
a
standard
should
be
set
based
on
the
application
to
the
latest
scientific
knowledge
of
the
standard
requisite
to
protect
public
health,
and
in
this
case,
you
gave
the
ozone
standard,
the
standard
was
at
the
upper
level.09
parts
per
million
over
an
eight-hour
period
and
at
the
lower
level,.07.
now,
the
question
about
why
the
administrator
chose
one
number
within
that
range
is,
of
course,
the
question
that
the
court
of
appeals
under
section
307(b)(1)
to
which
it
will
apply
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
not
in
accordance
with
law
standard
that
it
has
not
yet
done
in
this
case,
but
i
can
articulate
for
you
why
both
why
no
one
thought
the
range
should
be
below.07,
that
is
regulating
down
to
zero
risk,
and
why
the
administrator
chose.07
versus.08.
i'll
start
with
the
second
first
to
make
sure
that
i
get
to
the
salient
point.
.07
was,
and
this
is
reflected
in
the
federal
register
notice
promulgating
the
rule
at
pages
38863
to
38868.
.08
was
chosen
over.07
because
one,
there
were
no
demonstrated
adverse
health
effects
below.08.
two,
the
average
responses,
even
at.08
were
typically
small
or
mild.
three,
the
most
certain
effects
at
or
below.08
were
transient
and
reversible.
four,.07
is
at
or
slightly
above
peak
background
levels
in
some
locations.
and
five,
not
one
single
member
of
casac
recommended.07
and
in
the
legal
challenges
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
standard,
no
party
has
challenged
the
administrator's
decision
not
to
go
to.07.
.07
was
viewed
by
casac
and
the
epa
staff
as
within
the
lower
range
because
with
respect
to
two
of
the
six
testable
health
effects
or
end
points
or
lung
function,
that
is,
the
ability
to
exhale,
the
volume
you
exhale
in
one
second
and
symptoms,
it
was
possible
to
extrapolate
from
studies
done
at
and
above.08
to
levels
all
the
way
down
to
zero
just
by
using
an
arithmetic
extrapolation.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
there
may
be
certain--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
scalia,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
and
no
basis
for
an
assertion
that
either
casac
or
the
epa
or
the
administrator
have
done
what
they
have
said
the
law
does
not
permit
them
to
do.
that
is,
to
take
economic
or
cost
effects
into
account.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
when
there
is
an
observed
symptomatic...
as
i
said,
there
are
six
different
health
effects
that
are
measured,
and
these
are
reflected
in
the
staff
papers.
they
range
in
level
from
very
serious
to
potentially
not
serious
at
all.
the
first
two
are
mortality
and
emergency
room
hospital
admissions.
the
middle
two
are:
is
there
inflammation
in
the
lungs,
and
do
the
lungs
manifest
an
unnatural
responsiveness
to
pathogens
or
infection,
and
the
two
smaller
ones
which
i
addressed
as
to
which
there
is
data
below.08
are,
does
it
limit
the
amount
of
volume
you
can
expel.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
there
may
be
some
transient
effects.
inflammation
in
the
lungs
for...
a
hospital
admission
may
reflect
a
transient
effect,
but
the
administrator
since
1970
has
viewed
that
as
by
definition
adverse.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no,
i
may
have
misspoken.
but
there
are...
if
you
are...
epa
concludes
that
if
epidemiological
studies
show
that
you
are
required
to
go
to
the
emergency
room,
they
deem
that
to
be
an
adverse
health
effect.
that
is,
a
medically
significant
health
effect.
what
the
administrator
does
when
she
gets
the
data
within
the
range
is
to
make
a
judgment.
the
statute
requires
her
to
make
a
judgment
within
that
range
by
reference
to
three
factors.
she
looks
first,
justice
scalia,
at
the
nature
and
severity
of
the
health
effects.
a
cough
is
not
like
a
death,
obviously.
she
looks
at--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--coughs
may
count.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
criterion--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
criterion...
nothing
that...
anything
that
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of
a
medically
significant
health
effect
does
not
count.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
as
i
explained
earlier
and
as
the
agency
has
explained
and
the
d.c.
circuit
has
explained,
it
is
a
health
effect
that
rises
to
the
level
at
which
a
medical
professional
would
deem
it
to
be
a
concern
that
should
be
treated.
in
this
case,
with
respect
to
pulmonary
effects,
the
agency
has
always
applied
the
standards
of
the
american
thoracic
society.
i
understand,
i
do
understand
the
question.
you
are
asking
for
a
determinant
criterion,
but
this...
this
court's
precedents
have
not
and
cannot
require
an
agency
with
respect
to
an
area
where
there
are
many
different
pollutants,
many
different
kinds
of
health
effects,
many
different
kinds
of
health
effects
and
many
different
kinds
of
science
and
scientific
uncertainty
to
provide
that
criterion.

to

--of

for
the

she
made,

what

what
the

factors
are,
what
the...
and
that's
test--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
it's
not.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that
is
correct.
may
i
reserve?
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
of
ohio
is
asking
this
court
to
rule
that
the
administrator
may
not
revise
national
ambient
air
quality
standards
for
ozone,
and
that
even
if
she
can
revise
them,
that
she
cannot
implement
them
either
for
primary
or
secondary
standards.
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
held,
in
a
judgment
that
no
one
petitioned
from,
that
the
clear
language
of
the
statute
requires
epa
to
revise
and,
as
appropriate,
promulgate
new
standards
for
ozone,
and
that
nothing
in
section
181
in
any
respect
impairs
her
ability
to
enforce
the
secondary
standard,
which
is
identical,
and
we
think,
therefore,
that
those
questions
are
not
properly
before
the
court.
what
is
before
the
court
is
the
question
of
whether,
having
resolved
the
legal
question
before
it,
which
is
the
challenge
to
epa's
authority
to
revise
and
provide
a
new
standard,
the
court
of
appeals
acted
properly
in
going
beyond
that
and
opining,
based
on
some
preamble
language,
to
the
new
rule
that
epa
promulgated,
that
epa
could
either
not
implement
the
new
primary
standard,
or
implement
it
only
in
conformity
with
subpart
(2),
which
are
the
specific
implementation
provisions
that
congress
enacted
in
1990
for
the
1-hour
ozone
standard.
we
think...
we
have
two
submissions.
first,
there
was...
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
properly
address
the
issue
of
how
epa
will
implement
the
new
standard
that
it
said
it
had
authority
to
set,
because
epa
has
not
undertaken
any
final
agency
action
to
do
so,
and
the
time
for
doing
so
has
not
yet
come.
second
of
all,
the
question
is,
because
it
hasn't
engaged
in
the
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
about
how
to
implement
the
8-hour
standard,
the
epa
has
not...
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
perforce
phrased
in
terms
of
such
a
high
level
of
abstraction
that
not
even
any
of
the
respondents
can
agree
what
the
court
of
appeals
meant
when
it
said
in
its
third
try
at
this
that
epa
may
implement
the
8-hour
standard
only
in
conformity
with
subpart
(2),
and
therefore
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
not
have
reached
this
issue.
the
administrator
will
engage
in
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
specifying
how
the
act
is
to
be
implemented
at
the
time
that
she
promulgates
the
area
designations
that
the
states
have
provided
to
her
and
sets
the
schedule
for
what
are
called
state
implementation
plans,
and
at
that
point
she
will
have
issued
a
rule
and
undertaken
an
action
supported
by
an
explanation
that
this,
or
the
court
of
appeals
could
review.
thank
you.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
for
30
years,
the
epa
has
consistently
interpreted
the
clean
air
act
to
require
that
naaqs
be
set
solely
by
reference
to
the
effects
of
a
pollutant's
presence
in
the
air.
costs
and
other
factors
relating
to
removing
the
pollutant
are
accounted
for
under
the
statute
in
the
process
of
implementing
the
standards.
that
interpretation
reflects
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
and
the
intent
uniformly
expressed
both
by
the
d.c.
circuit
and
the
legislative
history
of
this
technology-forcing
act.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
epa...
we
concede
that
the
epa
can
consider
countervailing
health
concerns
that
derive
from
the
presence
of
the
pollutant
in
the
air,
for
example,
the
health,
the
health
cancer
problem,
but
we
do
not
concede,
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
unanimously
upheld
our
determination
that
we
cannot
consider
any
factors,
economic
or
health,
that
don't
derive
from
the
presence
of
the
pollutant
in
the
ambient
air
because
that's
what
section
108(a)(2)
requires.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
we
can--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no.
we
don't
concede
that.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
here's
the
difference.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i'm
not
sure
it's
important
either,
but
if
it
might
be,
i'll
address
it.
the
uvb
question,
that
is
the
question
about
whether,
well,
this
tropospheric
ozone
might
be
even
at
elevated
levels
that
cause
people
to
die
might
be
protecting
against
skin
cancer
was
a
case
of
first
impression
for
the
epa
in
this
case.
it
had
never,
there
had
never
been
such
a
claim
made
for
any
of
the
other
six
criteria
pollutants
in
any
of
the
five-year
reviews.
the
epa's
initial
determination,
which
it
defended
in
the
court
of
appeals,
was
that
it
was
not
appropriate
to
consider
that,
but
the
court
of
appeals
held
otherwise,
we
have
acquiesced
and
the
epa
is
in
fact
very
well
along
in
the
process
of
evaluating
and
characterizing
those
countervailing
health
effects
that
derive
from
the
presence
of
the
pollutant
in
the
air.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it's...
you're
referring
to
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--standard
that
is
set
for
ozone.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
i
don't
think
that
the
standard--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
believe
it
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
am
certain
that
in
either
the
criteria
documents,
the
staff
papers,
the
casac
concurrence
letters
or
the
preamble,
it
specifies
that
in
detail,
but
i'm
afraid
that
i
can't
tell
you
the
answer.
when
casac...
casac
concurred
unanimously
that
an
eight-hour
measuring
period
should
be
substituted
for
the
one-hour
period.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
believe
that's
right,
but
i
am
not
a...
i'm
not
even
in
the
realm
of
being
a
scientist,
and
i...
i
would
want
to
be
more
certain
before
i
set
it,
but
it's
not,
it's
not
just--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
is
in
fact
the
three-year
average
of
the
annual
fourth
highest
daily
eight-hour
average,
if
that's
clear.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
both
by
the
agency--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--okay
first
of
all,
costs
are...
the
statute
requires
the
epa
to
do
a
risk
assessment
analysis
which
was
referred
to
earlier,
and
that
be
provided
to
the
states
and
congress,
and
congress
routinely
reviews
this
to
determine
whether
to
adjust
the
enforcement
burdens
that
the
statute
applies.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes,
it
can,
in
the
following
respects.
first,
if
a
state
fails
to
create
a
sip,
a
state
implementation
plan,
epa
must
do
it
and
in
doing
its
own
implementation
plan
for
one
of
the
3,000
areas
in
the
country,
it
must
reference
all
of
that
data,
as
if
it
were
a
state.
secondly--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
have
a
whole
list.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
which
i
hope
will
answer
your
question.
leaving
aside
question
of
postponement
of
the
dates
and
extensions
of
time,
the
epa
must
use
that
data
to
determine
what
control
technique
guidelines
will
be
imposed
with
respect
to
ozone
in
particular.
it
must
use
that
data
in
determining
what
requirements
to
place
on
light
duty
truck
emissions.
it
also
must
use
that
data
to
set
performance
standards
for
new
stationary
sources
of
air
pollution
and
for
new
motor
vehicles.
the
theme
here
is,
as
i
said
before,
we
have
in
essence
a
two-part
statute.
part
one
is
set
the
standard.
and
part
two
is
implementation,
which
also
imposes
lots
of
regulatory
obligations
on
epa
itself.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
may
not
make
that
judgment,
and
the
reason
is,
as
you
suggested
in
i
believe
in
an
earlier
question
that
that
judgment
was
specifically
and
expressly
left
to
congress.
the
senate
report
which
accompanied
promulgation
of
the
1970
act,
at
pages
2
and
3
and
10
expressly
reflect
congress'
judgment
that
that
determination
is
to
be
left
for
congress
upon
reviewing
a
technology-forcing
statute
in
which
costs
will
not
be
considered.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
they
cannot...
epa
can--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--they
can't.
congress
has
provided,
for
example,
with
respect
to
attainment
of
the
standard
under
a
state
implementation
program
that
attainment
must
be
achieved
within
five
years,
but
epa
can
extend
it
for
another
five
years
and
then
give
two
additional
one-year
extensions,
all
by
referencing
questions
of
costs,
feasibility,
etcetera.
the
epa...
i
want
to
address
the
legislative
history
in
a
moment
because
the
history
both
before
and
after
the
1970
acts
is
very
revealing
here.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no.
i
don't
think
so
at
all.
the
first
thing
that
congress
did
after
it
passed
the
'70
act
was
to
provide
in
1977
that
the
standards
should
be
reviewed
and
revised
every
five
years.
now,
that
is
a
provision
that
is
codified
in
section
109(d).
it's
a
new
provision,
and
it's
significant
because
what
it
says
is
that
the
revisions
shall
be
made
in
the
same
manner
as
the
original
standards
are
set,
by
reference
to
the
criteria
documents
and
section
109(b).
now,
i
think
that
one
of
the
things
one
can
glean,
one
of
the
many
things
one
can
glean
from
the
legislative
history,
is
that
when
congress
did
that
in
1977,
it
knew
repeatedly
without
any
doubt
and
from
a
commission
that
it
itself
asked
to
look
at
this
question,
that
the
epa
was
setting
the
standards
without
reference
to
costs
or
other
implementation
factors,
and
yet,
it
required
the
epa
to
revise
the
standards
every
five
years
and
expressly
said
that
they
are
to
do
so
in
the
same
manner
as
which
the
original
standards
are
set.
there
was,
in
particular,
a
1970
congressional
research
service
report,
1975,
congressional
research
service
report
that
was
asked
to
look
at
this
question,
and
outlined
the
debate
over
whether
to
retain
the
effects
of
the
pollutants
as
the
sole
criteria
of
standard
setting,
and
congress
did
that
in
1977.
but
it
went
further,
justice
kennedy.
it
also
directed
that
another
commission,
an
independent
commission,
be
established
to
look
at
this
question,
and
that
commission
reported
to
congress
in
1981,
and
it
said,
"the
current
statutory
criteria
and
requirements
for
setting
air
quality
standards
at
the
levels
necessary
to
protect
public
health
without
considering
economic
factors
should
remain
unchanged.
"
and
when
congress
revised
the
statute
in
1990,
that's
exactly
what
it
did.
and
both
the
house
and
the
senate
reports
accompanying
the
1990
legislation
said
that
primary
naaqs
are
"set
at
a
level
that
protects
the
public
health
with
an
adequate
margin
of
safety
without
regard
to
the
economic
or
technical
feasibility
of
attainment.
"
this
court
itself
said
in
the
union
electric
case,
construing
the
clean
air
act,
and
i'm
quoting,
"when
congress
intended
the
administrator
to
be
concerned
about
economic
or
technological
feasibility,
it
has
expressly
so
provided.
"
and
in
the
benzene
case,
which
my
opponent
has
cited
but
which
i
think
strongly
supports
us,
the
court
said,
and
i
am
quoting,
"when
congress
has
intended
that
an
agency
engage
in
cost/benefit
analysis,
it
has
clearly
indicated
such
intent
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
"
now
there,
this
court
determined
that
before
osha
could
lower
the
level
for
a
particular
toxic
material
or
hazard
physical
agent
below
an
existing
standard,
it
had
to
determine
that
there
was
a
significant
risk
to
safety.
and
that
determination
was
to
be
made
without
reference
to
cost/benefit
analysis,
and
if
i
can
just
say
one
thing
with
respect
to
the
previous
argument,
that
standard,
significant
risk
to
safety,
has
no
more
countervailing
extraneous
factors
imported
into
it
than
the
public
health
adequate
margin
of
safety
requisite
standard
that
exists
here.
in
fact,
this
court
went
on
at
length
to
say
that
it
doesn't
require
mathematical
precision
and
there
will
be
a
range
of
factors
and
that
judgment
has
to
be
rendered
and
that
the
court
will
simply
have
to
review
whether
the
decision
is
arbitrary
or
capricious.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
the
epa
reasonably
interprets
the
clean
air
act
as
not
either
requiring
or
permitting
it
to
set
levels
that
are
at
or
below
background
levels,
and
it
has
never
yet,
i
mean,
you
know,
science
inexorably
creeps
forward,
but
the
epa
has
never
set,
found
a
level
necessary,
for
example,
to
eliminate
the
internal
combustion
engine.
in
fact,
with
respect
to
ozone,
the
first
time
the
epa
changed
the
standard,
it
changed
the
standard
from
a.08
one-hour
standard,
which
is
much
stricter
than
what
we
have
here,
to
a.12
one-hour
standard.
that
is,
it
relaxed
it
and
of
course,
it
was,
this
goes
to
justice
scalia's
question
from
a
while
ago,
it
relaxed
it
and
of
course
the
american
lung
association
and
others
came
running
in
and
saying
that's
ridiculous.
you
know,
how
can
you
be
relaxing
the
standard?
health
effects
could
occur.
and
you
know
i
commend
the
d.c.
circuit's
opinion,
in,
it's
called
american
petroleum
institute
vs.
kostill
for
an
analysis
of
why
there
are,
in
fact,
countervailing
factors
that
would
permit
an
administrator
exercising
judgment
within
the
zone
of
reasonableness
to
raise
the
standard.
now,
i
want
to
say
something
about
your,
your
earlier
question
about
what
if
the
costs
were
so
astronomical
to
require
us
to
deindustrialize,
although
deindustrialization
would
be
quite
unhealthy,
and
was
quite
unhealthy.
i
want
to
say
two
things.
first
of
all,
congress
has
made
a
rational
decision
that
with
respect
to
what
it
viewed
and
characterized
as
the
most
serious
problem
facing
america
in
1970,
which
was
air
pollution,
that
it
wanted
to
create
an
agency,
an
expert
agency
that
would
rely
on
science
and
the
latest
scientific
knowledge
to
do
as
step
one,
just
tell
us.
we
recognize
this
is
going
to
be
hard.
we
recognize
that
some
of
these
chemicals
are
"nonthreshold",
but
tell
us,
based
on
your
best
judgment
what
level
would
be
safe
to
set
for
the
whole
country.
and
then,
establishes
a
program
for
how
to
achieve
the
levels
by
balancing
the
burdens
between
cars
and
stationary
sources
of
pollution.
but
secondly,
the
epa
was...
the
epa
has
always
done
cost
estimates
at
the
time
that
it
promulgates
the
criteria
documents
so
that
the
states
can
use
them
in
implementing.
and
retrospective...
looking
retrospectively,
every
single
one
of
those
cost
estimates
has
vastly
overstated
the
actual
cost/benefit
analysis
of
what
it
took
to
meet
that
level.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
justice
o'connor,
the
reason
is
that
when
it
sets
the
standard,
it
is...
and
this
is,
i'm
making
reference
to
the
language
of
sections
108
and
109
of
the
act,
which
are
reprinted
at
pages
109-a
through
112-a
of
the
appendix
to
our
petition.
they're
in
several
other
places.
the
standards
must
be
set,
it
says
this
in
109,
based
on
the
criteria.
and
in
108(a)(2),
it
says
that
the
criteria
shall
accurately
reflect
the
latest
scientific
knowledge
useful
in
indicating
the
kind
and
extent
of
all
identifiable
effects
on
public
health
or
welfare
which
may
be
expected
from
the
presence
of
such
pollutant
in
the
ambient
air,
so
that
does
not
look
at--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--so
that
does
not
look
at...
it
does...
when
it
sets
the
standard,
should
it
be.08
or.09
or
3.5,
when
it
sets
the
standard,
it
does
not
look
at,
are
there
electric
cars
or
not
electric
cars
or
are
there
scrubbers
for
so2
emissions
or
not?
it
sets
the
standard
at
what
is
requisite
to
protect
public
health
from
the
effects
of
that
ubiquitous
pollutant,
but
once
those
standards
are
set,
it
is
then
up
to
the
states
and
epa
to
determine
one,
what
areas
within
our
jurisdictions
don't
meet
those
general
standards,
and
then--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it's
not
a
consideration
in
setting
the
standards,
and
the
point
that
i
wanted
to
make.
i
didn't
successfully
make
it.
is
that
time
and
again
with
respect
to
each
one
of
these
standards,
there
have
been
complaints
that
this
would
require
10
horrible
things.
with
respect
to
the
original
standards,
which
then
authorize
the
epa
to
set
tailpipe
emissions
for
new
cars.
this
is
discussed
extensively
in
some
of
the
amicus
briefs.
the
automobile
industry
stated
publicly
that
it
was
impossible
to
meet
those
standards,
and
if
it
were
possible,
the
companies
would
go
bankrupt.
as
it
turns
out,
the
standard...
the
companies
did
develop
the
technology.
they
met
the
standards
well
ahead
of
the
schedule
that
epa
and
congress
had
revised
and
as
a
result
with
respect
to
all
six
of
the
criteria
pollutants,
the
health
in
this
country
is
vastly
better
now
than
it
was
in
1970,
even
though
we
have
a
much
bigger
population
and
we
have
a
much
greater
level
of
industrialization.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
don't
think...
well,
this
is
a--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
justice
o'connor,
that
would
be
a
question
for
congress
because
everybody
understands
and
congress
has
said
that
it
does
not
expect
or
allow
the
epa
to
regulate
to
zero
biological
risk.
it
regulates
to
a--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
does.
it
does.
with
respect.
it
says
that
standards
must
be
set
at
levels
that
are
requisite,
that
is
necessary,
but
not
more
than
necessary
to
protect
against,
not
all
effects,
but
public
health
effects
arising
from
the
presence
of
the
pollutant
in
the
air,
which
the
agency
and
the
courts,
supported
by
the
legislative
history,
interpret
as
meaning
effects
that
are
of
medical
significance
that
affect
a
sufficiently
significant
proportion
of
the
population
that
the
administrator
in
her
judgment
can
conclude
reasonably
that
it
constitutes
a
public
health
effect.
now--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
is
correct.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
treatability
is
a...
is
one
of
the
factors
that
goes...
that
builds
into
the
accepted
medical
profession's
definition
of
what
constitutes
an
adverse
health
effect.
but
it
would
also...
may
i
just
finish
the
answer?
it
would
also
never
be
required
because
the
epa,
the
statute,
this
is
not
a
statute
that
requires
or
permits
the
epa
to
take
our
society
to
zero,
to
take
our
society
below
what
otherwise
occurs
in
the
air
without
all
of
this
man-made
pollution-inducing
activity.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that
is
correct.
she
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
don't
know
whether
or
not
it's
possible
or
not,
justice
breyer,
but
i
will
say
this.
in
30
years
under
this
act,
and
this
act
is...
this
act
is
the
premiere
example
of
the
point
that
justice
kennedy
was
expressing
for
the
court
in
loving
of
cooperation
between
two
different
branches
under
the
separation,
under
the
permissible
separation
of
powers
to
achieve
a
result.
congress
has
over
and
over
and
over
again
adjusted
implementation
issues
in
response
to
problems
of
cost
and
feasibility,
but
never,
it
has
never
done
either
of
the
following
two
things.
it
has
never
changed
a
naaqs.
never
said
no,
that's
too
low,
we'll
have
to
deindustrialize,
and
it
has
never
changed
the
factors
that
epa
considers
and
doesn't
consider
in
setting
naaqs.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
although
in
some
of
the
rate-making
cases,
i
think
it
was
probably
apparent
from
the
context.
i
mean,
my
colleague
cites
hope
natural
gas,
which
was
not
a
nondelegation
case,
but
it
was
apparent
from
the
context.
but
i
think
the
interesting
point,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
this
court
has
decided
many
cases
in
which
it
is
clear
that
it
was
neither
necessary
nor
important.
benzene
is
the
best
possible
example
of
that.
but
it
is
also
true
in
other
cases.
i
mean,
if
one
can
go
all
the
way
back
to--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--a
cost/benefit
analysis
in
determining
in
either
making
the
statute
constitutional
under
the
nondelegation
doctrine,
or
providing
a
sufficient
principle
for
determining
what
is
a
significant
safety
risk.
but
the
other
case
that
just
comes
to
mind
is,
in
many
ways...
the
first
nondelegation
case
of
the
last
century,
the
stranahan
case,
buttfield
vs.
stranahan
in
which
congress
passed
a
law
that
told
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
for
some
reason
to
set
uniform
rates
for
the
quality
of
tea
and
to
prohibit
the
importation
of
any
tea
that
did
not
meet
those
standards.
now,
there's
no
indication
in
the
record
in
the
case
that
cost/benefit
analysis
went
into
the
determination
of
what
an
appropriate
standard
for
tea
quality
was,
and
it's
frankly
hard
to
imagine
how
it
would
have
been
done
so.
in
my
few
remaining
minutes,
i
would
like
to
address
my
comments
to
the
argument
that
somehow
the
words
public
health
requires
this
court,
notwithstanding
20
years
of
d.c.
circuit
precedent
to
the
contrary,
to
require
some
form
of
cost/benefit
analysis.
and
i
have
five
points
to
make
with
respect
to
that
in
my
remaining
time.
first
of
all,
the
legislative
history,
the
1970
legislative
history
reflects
that
congress
intended
the
plain
meaning
of
public
health
to
mean
to
protect
populations,
not
the
most
sensitive
person
as
is
the
case
in
the
osha
benzene
context.
number
two,
if
you
look
at
section
108(a)
of
the
act,
which
determines
what
criteria
are,
it
is
the
effects
on
public
health
of
the
presence
of
the
pollutant
in
the
air
that
is
being
ascertained
and
costs
does
not
make
sense
in
that
context.
there
are
also,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
many
provisions
of
the
clean
air
act
that
require
consideration
of
both
costs
and
public
health,
and
they
are
collected
in
the
brief
of
massachusetts
and
new
jersey
at
page
29.
well...
penultimately,
the
winslow
definition,
the
1951
definition
that
ata
cites
is
a
definition
of
the
profession
of
public
health,
the
discipline
of
public
health.
there
is
no
showing
in
this
record
or
in
the
legislative
history
that
that
case,
that
that
definition
was
ever
even
cited
in...
by
1970,
much
less
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress.
and
there
is
no
showing
whatsoever
in
the
legislative
history
that
that
definition
was
interpreted
that
way
before
1970.
i
mean,
it
would
require
section
109(b)
to
say
that
naaqs
must
be
set
at
the
level
requisite
to
protect
the
profession
of
public
health
with
an
adequate
margin
of
safety.
and
in
fact,
there
is
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
all
public
health
organizations
agree
can
you
only
determine
this
with
respect
to
costs,
at
page
36,
footnote
27
of
our
principle
brief
on
this
appeal,
we
reference
and
describe
the
expressed
views
of
the
american
public
health
association
which
is
the
national
umbrella
organization
for
public
health
professionals,
which
specifically
has
endorsed
the
process
that
epa
uses
for
setting
the
naaqs
standard.
in
short,
there
is
nothing
in
section
108
or
109
that
permits
epa
to
set
a
level
inadequate
to
protect
the
public
health
because
of
the
costs
of
compliance.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
