justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
on
your
countervailing
factors,
are
you
referring
to
countervailing
health
factors,
as
well
as
countervailing
economic
factors?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
do
you
interpret
what
she
has
done
is
to
exclude
all
countervailing
health
factors?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
lead
industry
holds
that
they
may
not
consider
countervailing
health
factors,
as
opposed
to
countervailing
economic
factors?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that
standard
were
to
comply
with
the
delegation
doctrine?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
interrupt
you
on
that
very
one.
you
said
it
has
no
stare
decisus
effect.
of
course,
we
have
the
authority
to
reject
the
case,
and
we're
not
bound
by
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
doesn't
it
have
stare
decisus
effect
if
the
doctrine
really
has
meaning
in
terms
of
the
community
and
the
agency
and
everything
have
relied
on
it
for
20
years
in
planning
their
courses
of
action.
isn't
that
what
the
heart
of
stare
decisus
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
waxman,
if
we're
permitted
to
ask
unimportant
questions,
can
i
ask
what
eight
hours
we
are
talking
about,
in
the
eight
hour
standard?
which
eight
hours
of
the
day
is
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ozone.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
eight
hours
is
more
reliable
than
one
hour,
but
i'm
wondering
if,
i
just
don't
find,
you
tell
me,
which
eight
hours
is
it?
is
it
from
midnight
to
8
a.m.,
because--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
it
would
vary,
i
think,
tremendously.
