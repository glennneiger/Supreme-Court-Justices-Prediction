unknown
speaker
did
those
effects
have
to
be
medically
significant?
unknown
speaker
and
in
simplest
terms,
what
is
the
intelligible
principle
here?
unknown
speaker
good.
okay.
unknown
speaker
before
you
get
off
the
first
issue,
you
say
it's
easy
to
say,
but,
but,
but
what
does
requisite
to
protect
public
health
consist
of?
i
mean,
suppose,
you
know,
the
scientific
evidence
indicates
that
there
is
some
risk
beyond...
below
a
certain
level
of
pollutant
in
the
air,
but
that
risk
has
not
been...
the
extent
of
that
risk
has
not
been
scientifically
determined.
now,
what
is
requisite
to
protect
the
public
health?
everything
above
zero
risk?
unknown
speaker
well,
before
we
get
to
the
steps,
i
mean,
i
don't
think
that
an
accumulation
of
procedures
is
going
to
make...
is
going
to
create
a
criterion
that
doesn't
otherwise
exist.
what
is
the
criterion?
how
do
you
decide
how
much
risk
is
too
much
risk,
or
is
that
just
up
to
the
agency?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
that's
easy.
you
are
talking
about
demonstrated
effects,
but
my
question
went
to
those
areas
in
which
we
don't
know
what
the
effects
are.
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
risk
that
there
may
be
some
effects,
but
we
do
not
know
what
they
are.
what
is
requisite
to
protect
the
public
health?
has
congress
made
clear
what's
requisite?
unknown
speaker
okay.
then
what
is
it?
it's
something
above
zero,
but
what
is
it
to
decide
whether
the
risk
is
too
much
risk?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
right
there
about
the
casac
reviews,
so
called,
the
scientific
committee.
i
thought
the
statute
required
that
committee
to
advise
the
epa
of
any
adverse
public
health,
welfare,
social,
economic,
or
energy
effects
which
may
result
from
various
strategies
for
attainment
and
maintenance
of
the
national
standards.
i
mean,
the
statute
does
require
the
scientific
committee
to
look
at
all
those
things
and
to
report
it
to
the
epa.
now,
why
would
congress
want
that
advice
on
economic
and
energy
effects
if
congress
didn't
want
the
epa
to
consider
those
in
setting
the
standards?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
but
in
your
view
in
looking
at
the
standards
governing
epa's
setting
of
these
national
ambient
air
quality
standards,
you
think
that
the
epa
may
not
consider
any
of
these
economic
or
cost
factors--
unknown
speaker
--as
part
of
its
required
consideration
of
factors
in
setting?
unknown
speaker
i...
were
you
finished?
unknown
speaker
the...
the...
i'm
not,
don't...
i'm
accepting
this
for
the
sake
of
argument
only.
don't
assume
it's
my
position.
but
the...
if
i
look
at
their
argument
on
the
delegation
part,
the
nondelegation
part
in
light
of
what
you
have
just
said,
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
saying
that
when
we
look
at
it,
specifically
the
health
part,
what
we
are
talking
about
with
ozone
is
coughing
outdoor
children.
and
if
we
look
at
coughing
outdoor
children
we
see
with.09
in
the
air,
approximately.9
of
1
percent
of
all
the
coughing
outdoor
children
will
cough
and
it
will
hurt.
and
if
we
go
to.08,
we
get.6
of
1
percent
and
if
we
go
to.07,
we
get.3
of
1
percent.
see,
it's
a
line
they
draw
between
points.
9,
6,
3.
and
they
say
there
is
no
way
to
draw,
nowhere
to
stop
on
that
line.
absolutely
not.
once
you
take
all
costs
and
these
other
things
out
of
it,
why
are
you
protecting
the.6
and
not
the.3?
why
the.3,
not
the.9?
that's,
i
think,
what
i
take
it
is
their
main
claim
on
the
nondelegation
point
and
so
i
would
like
to
you
respond
to
that
directly.
unknown
speaker
well,
fine.
i
mean,
i
understand
what
you
are
saying,
but
it
still
leaves
open
the
question,
why
aren't
transient
health
effects
health
effects?
i
mean,
so
it's
less
coughing,
and
it
doesn't
hurt
as
much.
why
do
you
say
that
that
should
be
ignored?
unknown
speaker
and
as
for
casac
and
the
parties
not
favoring
going
below
what
you
finally
picked,
i
mean,
that
can
be
explained
because
they,
unlike,
unlike
epa,
may
have
been
taking
economic
effects
into
account.
you
know,
if
it
required
closing
down
the
entire,
the
entire
steel
industry,
for
example.
unknown
speaker
then
come
back
and
tell
me,
tell
me
why
transient
coughing
effects
are...
shouldn't
be
considered.
unknown
speaker
but
all
you
are
telling
me,
general,
is
that...
is
that
there
are...
there
are
reasons
why
one
would
pick
the
higher
levels
and
not
pick
the
lower
levels.
it
makes
more
sense
to
pick
the
higher
levels,
but
you
still
haven't
given
me
a
criterion
of
where
you
stop.
why
not
go
lower?
what's
the
matter
with
stopping
transient
health
of
adverse
health
effects?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
principle?
then
one
of
the
principles
that
epa
has
applied
and
can
derive
from
this
statute
is
that
transient
health
effects
are
not
to
be
taken
into
account.
unknown
speaker
so
coughs
don't
count?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a...
i'm
looking
for
some
criterion
i
can
glom
on
to
and
say
this
is
the
standard.
coughs
don't
count
or
transient
effects
don't
count.
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
that
doesn't
count?
unknown
speaker
that's
circular.
what
is
a
medically
significant
health
effect?
is
a
transient
cough
a
medically
significant
health
effect?
unknown
speaker
she
hasn't
said
why.
she
said
these
things
are
worse,
and
we
are
banning
them.
these
things
are
not
so
bad,
and
we
are
not
going
to
ban
them.
but
you
could
have
drawn
the
line
anywhere
and
said
the
same
thing.
you
could
have
gone
up
from,
you
know,
0.8
to
1.0
and
said
the
same
thing.
the
things
above
here
are
very
bad.
the
things
below
here
are
not
so
bad.
unknown
speaker
i
want
a
criterion
for
why
she
drew
the
line
at
0.8.
now
maybe,
maybe
you
don't
need
it
for
the
constitutional
point.
maybe
congress
can
leave
it
to
her,
you
know,
to
pick
a
reasonable
point.
but
gee,
she
has
to
say
the
basis
on
which
she
picked
the
reasonable
point,
at
least
for
the
arbitrary
or
capricious
point,
don't
you
think?
unknown
speaker
is
that
an
issue
before
us?
unknown
speaker
okay.
so
i
mean,
your...
your
position,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that...
that
this
determinant
point
is
not
necessary
to
satisfy
the
delegation
doctrine,
and
the...
and
as
you
have
just
said,
the
question
of
reasonableness
or
capriciousness
is
not
before
us
because
it
was
never
reached
by
the
court
below.
unknown
speaker
yes,
you
may,
general
waxman.
mr.
warren,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
can
you
explain,
because
this
goes
to
the
heart
of,
i
think,
of
our
understanding
of
your
case,
why
your
argument
relates
to
delegation
as
opposed
to
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
stand,
the
point
at
which
we
ended
up
with...
with
your
brother.
unknown
speaker
true,
but
we're
living
under
a
regime
in
which
things
like
just
and
reasonable
and
public
convenience
and
necessity
pass
muster,
and
so
it's
not
clear
to
me
why
the
delegation
here,
in
light
of
those
examples,
is
wrong,
as
distinct
from
the
argument
that
what
the
administrator
has
done
does
not
satisfy
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
delegation
issue?
unknown
speaker
but
your
defending,
mr.
warren,
are
you
not,
a
decision
that
said
that
said
there
is
no
intelligible
principle
in
this
statute.
to
get
one,
someone
has
to
make
it
up,
either
the
court
or
the
agency.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
intelligible
principle
in
the
statute.
surely
it's
not
in
the
statute
that
there
must
be
a
cost/benefit
analysis.
unknown
speaker
and
you've
derived
the
notion
of
cost
from
public
health.
i
mean,
that
is
as
obvious
or
not
obvious,
one
or
the
other,
and
this
regime
has
been
going
on...
lead
industries
was
1980,
and
this
debate
has
been
going
on
and
yet
when
congress
made
adjustments,
it
always
made
adjustments
on
the
implementation
end.
it
never
did
what
could
have
been,
what
could
have
ended
this
debate
very
swiftly.
unknown
speaker
but
there
has
been
some
action
by
congress
stretching
out
the
time
to
achieve
attainment.
unknown
speaker
but
i
think
it
is
the
case,
number
one,
that
the
implementation
process,
may,
and
i
presume
does,
consider
economics
when
it
determines
the
period
of
time
in
which
compliance
must
be
reached,
and
of
course,
congress
may
do
that.
and
so
that
i
think
it's
wrong
on
anybody's
premises
to
say
that
economics
is
excluded
from
the
process.
now,
it
may
very
well
be
that
if
the
cost
is
so
horrendous,
that
there
is...
that
there
is
no
implementation
period
in
which
the
cost
would
not
be
very
great
on
an
annual
basis.
in
20
years,
it's
still
going
to
be
enormously
costly.
i
think
the
solicitor
general's
response
to
that,
if
i
understand
the
briefs,
is
that,
in
effect,
is
the
decision
that
congress
reserved
to
itself
by
periodically
taking
up
the
question
of
revising
implementation
standards
as
it
has,
as
we
are
going
to
get
to,
i
guess,
in
the
next
case.
unknown
speaker
right.
let's
assume,
let's
assume
that
is
so,
and
i
don't
believe
the
solicitor
general
will
agree,
but
let's
assume
it
is
so.
then
i
think
the
government's
answer
would
be
congress
has
set
out
the
scheme
which
in
effect
reserves
to
congress
the
right
to
revise
implementation,
and
that's
the
point
at
which
economics
definitely
will
be
given
its
place.
but
even
on
your
kind
of
worst
case
argument,
i
think
the
government's
response
is
that's
what
congress
wanted,
and
congress
has
reserved
to
itself
the
power
to
interfere
in
the
process.
unknown
speaker
and
they
can
say
how
long
their
time,
how
much
time
will
be
allowed
for
that
burden
to
be
borne,
which
has
an
obvious
economic
consequence.
unknown
speaker
then
the
argument
is
that
congress
has
reserved
something
and
it
shouldn't
have
reserved
it.
it
should
have
given
the
power
in
the
first
instance
to
the
administrator.
unknown
speaker
but
the
words
that
you
are
ultimately,
the
word
that
you
are
depending
on
is
the
term
public
health
as
distinct
from
individual
health.
you'll
say,
you
say
that
imports.
that
implies
an
economic
criterion.
and
i
have
to
say
even
as
a
threshold
matter,
i
don't
know
why
that
implies
an
economic
criterion
in
some
different
way
than
a
reference
to
or
a
different
degree
than
a
reference
to
individual
health
would
do.
unknown
speaker
there
are
other
provisions
in
this
very
statute--
unknown
speaker
--that
use
the
term
public
health,
and
then
add
to
the
term
public
health
the
impact
upon
the
economy.
for
example,
section
76.12,
which
commissions
a
study
to
analyze
the
impact
of
this
chapter
on
the
public
health,
the
economy
and
the
environment.
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
they
didn't
really
have
to
say
economy.
unknown
speaker
there
are
several
other
places
in
the
statute
where...
where
public
health
is
added
or,
or,
or
referred
to
separately
from
economic
effects.
the
second
problem
i
have,
and
i
would
like
you
to
address
that
if
you
can
is,
i
don't
see
how
it
helps
your
delegation
problem
to
simply
add
the
economy
to
the
ineffable
pot
of
things
that
the
administrator
is
supposed
to
consider.
i
mean,
i
was
pressing
the
solicitor
general
on,
you
know,
is,
is
a...
is
a
cough
too
much.
i
don't
know
if
a
cough
is
too
much.
i
suppose,
you
know,
it's
a
hard
call,
but
does
it
make
it
easier
to
say,
well,
you
know,
if
you
are
going
to
stop
a
cough,
you
are
going
to...
it's
going
to
cost
$1,000
a
cough.
well,
i
don't
know.
does
that
help
you?
is
that
a
clear
standard?
unknown
speaker
is
$1,000
too
much
for
a
cough,
or
2,000,
3,000?
why
does
it
give
you
a
standard
simply
to
add,
add
economic
effects
to
the
thing.
it
still
seems
to
me
quite
as--
unknown
speaker
--but
they're
just
as
indeterminate.
it
seems
to
me
it's
not
enough
to
have
other
factors
on
the
other
side.
if
you're
going
to
bring
more
certainty
to
this
statute,
you
need
more
determinative
factors,
not
just
more
factors.
unknown
speaker
but
i
don't
see
how
it,
just
and
reasonable
rates.
the
question
that
i
asked
before--
unknown
speaker
--which
i
think
was
trying
to
get
your
argument--
unknown
speaker
--all
right.
i
could
ask
the
same
question
with
just
and
reasonable
rates.
i
could
ask
the
same
question
with
picking
out
trucking
routes
or
picking
out
airline
routes.
i
mean,
why
is
this
worse
than
those?
you
just
say
there
are
interests
on
both
sides,
so...
well,
there's
no
way
to...
there's
no
scale
in
heaven
or
anything
else,
other
than
judgment,
that
tells
us
what
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
is
in
terms
of
return
to
an
investor,
and
similarly
there's
nothing
other
than
judgment
that
would
tell
you
here
how
far
down
the
health
scale
you
go
before
it's
not
really
required
by
public
health.
unknown
speaker
then
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
you
have
50
countervailing
factors
you
may
get
a
more
informed
judgment.
i
agree
with
you
on
that,
but
i
now
suffer
from
justice
scalia's
question.
that
is,
i
agree
with
that.
i
don't
see
how
it's
one
wit
more
determinative
whether
you
have
50
factors
informing
your
judgment
or
one,
or
two.
unknown
speaker
don't
blame
it
on
me.
you're
arguing
for
a
law
of
rules.
you're--
[laughter]
you're
saying
that
congress
can't
give
this
to
the
epa
unless
it
holds
the
rein
pretty
tight.
i
thought
that's
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
and
the
government
says
the
competing
factors,
the
countervailing
factors
are
identified,
among
other
things,
by
looking
to
norms
today
about
the
need
for
treatment.
that's
a
countervailing
factor.
do
you
have
to
treat
it,
don't
you
have
to
treat
it?
is
the
effect
transitory,
is
it
nontransitory?
those
are
all
compared-to-what
kind
of
analyses,
and
they're
saying
you
get
those
compared-to-what
kind
of
analyses
without
having
to
get
into
economics
at
the
front
end
when
you're
setting
the
standard,
so
they
say
your
own
argument
is
met.
unknown
speaker
right,
but
they're
saying
that
at
the
standard-setting
stage
the
question
is
not
risk
management,
the
question
is
risk
identification,
and
we
identify
the
risks
by
bearing
in
mind
these
various
countervailing
factors.
we
manage
the
risk
at
stage
2,
at
the
implementation
stage.
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
a
clarifying
question?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying...
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
argument...
that
although
the
terms,
requisite
to
public...
protect
the
public
health
are
too
vague
and
too
standardless,
it
would
be
all
right
if
it
said,
are
requisite
to
protect
the
public
health
provided
it
doesn't
cost
too
much?
unknown
speaker
i
think
that's
what
you're
saying.
is
that
what
you're--
unknown
speaker
--includes--
--it's
not
provided
it
doesn't
cost
too
much--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
mr.
warren.
ms.
french,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
may
it
declare
one?
i
mean,
one
part
of
this
i
thought
was
that
the
congress
has
instructed
epa
periodically
to
review
these
national
ambient
air
quality
standards
and
revise
them
based
on
more
current
information,
so
it
seems
that
the
obligation
on
epa
to
review
and
revise
is
one
clear
instruction
that
congress
has
given.
unknown
speaker
where
do
we
find
the
section
you're
referring
to?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
so
you
mean
the
1990
standard
has
to
last
forever?
unknown
speaker
to
2010,
it's
still
the
1990
standard?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
congress
intended
to
prevent
the
epa
from
enforcing
new
ozone
national
ambient
air
quality
standards
anywhere
in
the
country?
unknown
speaker
for
ozone.
unknown
speaker
does
that
have
the
effect
of
reading
subpart
(1)
sort
of
out
of
existence?
unknown
speaker
then
congress--
--well,
section
(1)
will
continue
to
apply
for
other
pollutants--
unknown
speaker
--that
are
not
contained
in
table
1.
unknown
speaker
and
it
would
apply
as
to,
what
is
it,
the
secondary
standards--
unknown
speaker
--the
welfare
standards,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
it
covers
welfare
as
well
as
health?
unknown
speaker
if
congress
wanted
to
say
you
can't
pass
any
new
tougher
ozone
standard,
why
didn't
it
just
say
it,
instead
of
having
a
provision
in
there
that
says
you
should
revise
it
every
5
years?
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
say
that
you
shall
revise
the
ozone
standard
every
5
years,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
they
said,
you
shall
revise
standards
every
5
years,
and
that's
their
general
provision.
then
they
had
a
more
specific
provision
dealing
with
ozone
which
said,
this
is
going
to
be
the
standard.
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
legislative
history
which
is
where
they
all
got
up
on
the
floor
even
which
would
be
significant
to
me,
not
to
everyone,
where
they
said
and
now
this
means,
this
means
that
the
epa
has
no
more
power
to
revise
the
standards.
unknown
speaker
that's
third
from
the
bottom,
basically,
from
a
health
point
of
view.
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
now,
they're
home
free
forever.
you
said
ohio
is
now
attainment
area.
unknown
speaker
so
that's
it
for
ozone.
unknown
speaker
judge
tatel
had
a
different
view
of
how
these
two
subparts
worked,
did
he
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
never
mind--
--thank
you,
ms.
french.
unknown
speaker
on
the
same
theory,
i
guess
you
would
have
to
say
the
stone
age
problem
being
that
the
presence
of
a
certain
amount
of
ozone
is
the
air
is
necessary
to
prevent
the
kind
of
economic
activity
that
would
be
associated
with
the
stone
age,
and
that
health
problem.
