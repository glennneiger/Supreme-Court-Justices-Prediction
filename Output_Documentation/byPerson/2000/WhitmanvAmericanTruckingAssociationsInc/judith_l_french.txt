ms.
judith
l.

thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
epa's
promulgation
of
a
revised
ozone
standard
was
unlawful
because
it
conflicts
with
congress'
specific
and
comprehensive
plan
for
ozone
regulation
found
at
subpart
(2)
of
part
(d)
of
the
clean
air
act.
in
1990,
congress
rewrote
the
law
that
applies
to
ozone.
congress
rejected
the
old
and
failed
one-size-fits-all
approach
to
ozone
attainment.
congress
implemented
instead
a
comprehensive
and
unique
scheme
that
combines
realistic
expectations
with
measures
of
progress.
epa's
position
has
changed
repeatedly
over
the
last
few
years,
but
there
is
no
question
the
epa
intends
to
take
us
back
to
that
failed
approach.
for
the
states,
that
means
a
return
to
unrealistic
deadlines,
inflexible
requirements,
and
certain
failure.
we
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
lower
court's
judgment
that
epa
may
not
implement
a
different
standard.
ms.
judith
l.
french
not
with
respect
to
ozone,
your
honor.
we
need
to
look
at
section
181
of
the
act.
the
very
first
sentence
of
section
181,
which
is
the
first
section
of
subpart
(2),
states
specifically
that
each
area--
ms.
judith
l.
french
--that
would
be
in
the
brief
of
respondents
american
trucking
in
case
number
99-1257,
their
red
brief,
at
page
15-a.
ms.
judith
l.
french
the
first
sentence
of
that
section
reads
that
each
area
designated
nonattainment
for
ozone
shall
be
classified
according
to
table
1
that's
provided
there,
and
using...
by
operation
of
law,
and
using
the
design
value
for
each
area.
the
second
sentence
tells
us
that
the
design
value
is
calculated
according
to
the
methodology
that
epa
had
in
place
most
recently
before
november
15,
1990.
from
those
two
sentences
in
table
1,
we
have
a
specific
standard
in
place--
ms.
judith
l.
french
--that's
true,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
l.
french
yes,
your
honor.
congress
left
no
room
for
epa
to
promulgate
a
different
standard.
the
section,
section
181
is--
ms.
judith
l.
french
--for
ozone,
yes,
your
honor--
ms.
judith
l.
french
--that's
exactly
correct,
and
we
make
that
argument
based
on
the
specific
language
of
section
181,
in
particular,
table
1.
ms.
judith
l.
french
not
entirely,
your
honor.
however,
there
are
specific
limitations
in
subpart
(1).
for
instance,
in
section
172
of
the
act,
that's
the
section
that
gives
epa
its
general
authority
to
classify
areas
and
to
set
specific
attainment
deadlines,
congress
stated
in
the
1990
amendments
that
those
paragraphs
giving
epa
that
general
authority
do
not
apply
where
those
classifications
and
attainment
deadlines
have
been
set
in
other
parts
of
the
act.
ms.
judith
l.
french
exactly
right,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
l.
french
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
l.
french
no--
ms.
judith
l.
french
--no,
your
honor,
actually.
our
argument
is
that
subpart
(2)
would
also
apply
to
secondary--
ms.
judith
l.
french
--yes,
and
it
would
also--
ms.
judith
l.
french
--your
honor
is
correct
that
epa...
i'm
sorry,
that
congress
could
have
put
it
in
the
negative,
that
thou
shalt
not
revise
the
standard.
however,
they
put
it
in
the
positive.
ms.
judith
l.
french
no,
your
honor,
they
did
not.
ms.
judith
l.
french
exactly
right,
your
honor,
and
that
more
specific
language
came
later
in
time.
we
have
the
language
of
section
181,
which
gives
us
a
specific
standard,
gives
specific
classifications
or
gives
specific
deadlines.
this
is
a
deal
that
congress
brokered
in
1990
with
the
states
and
with
epa.
what
it
gives
to
us
and
gave
to
epa
at
the
time
was
certainty,
planning
certainty,
after
20
years
of
failure.
twenty
years--
ms.
judith
l.
french
--there
are
references,
your
honor,
to
the
number
of
other
kinds
of
revisions
that
congress
considered.
congress
considered
other
bills
that
would
have
given
epa
authority
to
revise
the
standard
within
a
certain
period
of
time
following
the
'90
amendments.
there
were
other
bills
that
would
have
given
epa,
for
instance,
the
authority
to
change
the
averaging
time
from
say
a
six-hour
standard
to
a
12-hour
standard.
what
congress
put
into
place
was
the
specific
standard
we
find
in
subpart
(2)
which
gives
us
the
one-hour
standard
using
the
design
value
that
was
in
place
at
the
time
of
the
'90
amendments.
congress
did
so
and
it
made
sense
to
do
so
because
of
the
failure
of
the
20
years
before
1990.
we'd
had
the
'70
amendments,
or
the
'70
act,
the
1977
amendments
and
then
leading
to
the
'90
amendments.
attainment
areas
across...
there
were
nonattainment
areas
across
the
country
and
congress
got
it
right
this
time,
after
20
years
of
failure,
we've
had
10
years
of
success.
the
state
of
ohio
is
a
good
example
of
that.
ten
years
ago
today,
the
state
of
ohio
ranked
third
among
the
50
states
for
areas
that
were
out
of
attainment
for
ozone.
ms.
judith
l.
french
from
meeting
the
standard
point
of
view,
yes,
your
honor.
we
had
the
most,
we
are
the
third
highest
member
of
areas
out
of
attainment.
today
the
entire
state
of
ohio,
as
well
as
the
states
of
michigan
and
west
virginia,
are
completely
in
attainment
and
that
is
only
after
following
congress'
scheme
for
ozone
attainment,
not
the
one-size-fits-all
approach
that
was
in
effect
until
1990.
again,
the
reason
for
the
'90
amendments
was
the
failure
that
came
before
the
'90
amendments.
ms.
judith
l.
french
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
judith
l.
french
that's
it
in
terms
of
just
having
to
meet
the
standard
that
is
currently
in
place,
but
even
when
areas
are
in
attainment,
your
honor,
they
are
not
without
regulation.
there
are
certainly
emission
requirements
to
be
met,
a
permitting
review
that
happens
on
a
continual
basis,
so
the
states,
the
areas
that
are
in
attainment
are
not
without
regulation
to
make
sure
that
we
continue
to
maintain
that
specific
standard.
ms.
judith
l.
french
he
did,
your
honor,
and
what
he
suggested
was
that
once
an
area
met
the
standard,
that
then
epa
could
change
the
standard
for
that
specific
area.
that
doesn't
work
with
subpart
(2)
for
three
reasons.
the
first
is
that
subpart
(2)
is
a
comprehensive
scheme
that
applies
nationwide.
the
second
is
that
section
172
of
the
act
takes
away
epa's
general
authority,
not
just
general
authority
with
the
1-hour
standard,
but
its
general
authority
for
classifying
areas
and
for
setting
deadlines.
the
final
reason
is
that
subpart
(2)
itself
in
section
181
refers
to
areas
that
are
currently
in
attainment
but
may
fall
out
of
attainment.
there
are
specific
provisions
in
place
that
would
apply
subpart
(2),
and
specifically
table
1,
to
those
areas.
there
is
simply
no
room
left,
whether
now,
in
the
future,
until
congress
acts
to
change
the
specific
standard.
we've
got
an
extraordinary
case
here
where
congress
balanced
the
interests,
many
of
the
interests
that
we're
talking
about
this
morning
with
respect
to
ozone.
congress
got
it
right,
and
we're
asking
the
court
to
simply
affirm
the
lower
court's
judgment
that
epa
may
not
implement
the
standard,
but
we
are
offering
as
an
alternative
basis
that
epa
cannot
implement
the
standard
because
congress
gave
it
no
authority
to
revise
the
standard
in
the
first
instance.
again,
we
need
to
look
only
specifically
at
section
181,
at
the
very
first
sentences,
the
sentence
that
provides
that
each
area
designated
nonattainment
for
ozone
shall
be
classified
in
accordance
with
table
1.
i
would
be
remiss
if
i
didn't
state
here
that
we
won
below.
a
majority
of
the
d.c.
circuit
agreed
the
epa
had
no
enforcement
authority
to
enforce
a
different
standard.
we
are
asking
the
court
to
go
one
step
further
on
alternative
grounds,
and
that
is
that
epa
cannot
implement
a
different
standard
because
it
may
not
revise
the
standard.
epa's
argument
is
that
they
cannot
implement
the
standard
because
it
becomes
unworkable.
it's
unworkable
because
congress
never
anticipated
that
the
1-hour
standard
would
be
changed
without
congressional
change.
just
as
the
states
and
epa,
i
may
remind
the
court
that
ep...
this
was
epa's
bill.
this
was
the
president's
bill
before
congress
asking
for
certainty,
asking
for
a
specific
standard,
a
specific
set
of
classifications,
and
specific
deadlines.
