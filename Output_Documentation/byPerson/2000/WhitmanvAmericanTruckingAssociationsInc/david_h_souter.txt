justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
see
why
that
makes
for
a
make
or
break
argument
on
the
point
of
delegation,
because
there
are
health-health
tradeoffs
so
that
there
are
ways
of
drawing
reasonable
lines
within
the
limited
concepts
of
health,
pro-health,
anti-health.
if
you
introduce
the
economic
factors
at
this
stage
of
the
analysis,
what
you
will
have
done
is
to
create
a,
or
recognize,
a
new
set
of
reasons,
but
it
doesn't
follow
from
that
that
for
purposes
of
the
delegation
doctrine,
it
is
impossible
to
draw
a
line
short
of
zero
which
is
not
arbitrary
if
you
don't
consider
the
economics
so
that
you
complicate
the
analysis.
you
may
complicate
the
analysis
in
what
is,
a
perfectly
desirable
way,
but
i
don't
see
that
it
either
makes
or
breaks
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
under
the
delegation
doctrine.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
we
may
or
may
not--
justice
david
h.
souter
--agree
on
that.
but
your,
your
other
argument
was
that
if
you
don't,
i
thought
it
was--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
if
you
don't
import
the
economic
consideration
at
this
stage,
there
is
no
logical
stopping
place
by
which
i
think
you
mean
there
is
no
way
to
draw
a
line
which
is
not
inherently
arbitrary
or
capricious.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
not
a
sound
argument
because
even
if
you
confine
your
countervailing
considerations
to
health
versus
health,
you
will
have
kinds
of
reasons
which
would
count
as
reasonable
bases
for
drawing
lines
short
of
zero.
justice
david
h.
souter
general,
can
we
go
back...
general,
can
we
go
back
to
your
answer
from
which
we're
sort
of
departing.
you
were
at
the
point
of
saying...
you
had
said,
that
economics
can
be
considered
at
the
implementation
stage.
justice
david
h.
souter
can
economics
be
considered
at
that
stage
for
any
purpose
other
than
deciding
what
period
of
time
will
be
allowed
for
complete
implementation?
justice
david
h.
souter
explain
how
that
works.
justice
david
h.
souter
can
epa
itself
make
such
a
decision?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
can
epa
ever
make
this
decision?
over
any
conceivable
period
of
time.
it
simply
will
be
economically
undesirable
to
exact
the
cost
of
meeting
this
standard,
therefore,
we
will
not
require
this
standard
to
be
met.
we
will
require,
say,
nothing
more
than
compliance
with
this
standard
discounted
by
40
percent.
justice
david
h.
souter
can
it
make
that
judgment?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
wanted
to
know
whether
i
got
it
right,
but
you
are
telling
me--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you
are
telling
me
that
yes--
justice
david
h.
souter
are
you
saying...
i
think
you're
saying
you'd
never
get
to
zero
because
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
you
would
have
to
get
to
zero
to
end
what
are
understood
to
be
treatable
diseases
or
treatable
effects?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
treatability...
is
the
effect
the
criterion,
isn't
it,
then?
