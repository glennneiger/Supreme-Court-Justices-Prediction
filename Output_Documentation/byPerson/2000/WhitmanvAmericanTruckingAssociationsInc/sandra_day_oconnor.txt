can
you
in
one
sentence
tell
me
what
standard
it
is
you
would
say
public
health
incorporates?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because,
i've
listened
to
a
lot
of
vague
language.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
from
you.
and
i
don't
understand
what
it
is
that
you
are
saying.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
tell
us,
though,
what
it
is
in
that
sentence
of
yours
that
makes
it
meet
the
nondelegation
standards,
whereas
the
present
provision
does
not,
as
interpreted
by
casac?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
waxman,
do
you
concede
that
epa
can
consider
countervailing
health
concerns,
for
example,
the
skin
cancer
problem?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
there,
though...
what
is
there,
though,
that
would
suggest
that
epa
could
not
decide
that
with
electric
motor
vehicles
we
could
achieve
a
better
standard
and
it
would
be
better
for
health
and
therefore,
we
are
going
to
set
a
much
lower
standard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
understand.
that's
what
have
you
been
saying
all
along,
but
a
few
minutes
ago,
you
seemed
to
be
trying
to
reassure
that
well,
i
mean,
epa
understands
we
have
automobiles
and
they're
not
going
to
set
something
that
means
there's
no
more
automobile
use
in
the
country.
and
yet,
what
you
have
just
said
again
would
indicate
that's
not
a
consideration
in
setting
the
standards.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
would
probably
be
even
better
if
we
set
it
at
zero.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
have
thought
the
health
would
be
a
lot
better
if
we
just
said
no
pollutants.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
statute
doesn't
say
that,
does
it?
