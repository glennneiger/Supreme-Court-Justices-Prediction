mr.
edward
w.
warren
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
from
what
you
have
already
heard
this
morning,
it
simply
cannot
be
true
that
congress
intended
for
the
administrator
to
make
decisions
which
would
cost
nearly
$50
billion
annually
by
2010,
when
the
administrator
herself
frankly
admits,
and
i'm
quoting,
that
she
followed
no
generalized
paradigm
in
making
these
decisions.
nor
could
congress
have
intended
for
the
administrator
to
regulate
ozone
and
particulate
matter
by
controlling
combustion
emissions
from
every
automobile,
factory,
and
commercial
activity
nationwide
when
again
using
her
words,
she
never
determined
what
risk
is
acceptable
through
quantification
or
any
other
metric,
any
other
metric.
this
court's
decisions
do
not
lightly
presume
that
congress
delegated
questions
of
such
great
economic
and
political
significance
to
an
administrative
agency,
nor
as
this
court
said
in
benzene,
in
the
benzene
decision,
do
they
allow
an
agency
like
epa
to
regulate
broadly
across
the
entire
economy
without
determining
what
risks
are
acceptable
or
unacceptable
in
an
everyday
common
sense
manner.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
yes,
justice
souter.
because
the
prerequisite,
the
logically
antecedent
question
for
arbitrary
and
capricious
review
is
an
intelligible
principle.
this
court
has
for
70
years
said
there
must
be
an
intelligible,
substantive
principle
against
which
the
rulemaking
can
be
conducted,
expert
advice
can
be
given,
and
judicial
review
can
take
place.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
let
meke
one
thing
absolutely
clear
from
the
outset...
it
should
be
clear
from
our
briefs.
and
that
is
that
we
are
not
saying
that
this
statute
does
not
provide
an
intelligible
principle,
what
we
are
saying--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--no
it's
really
not,
because
the
court
of
appeals
was
confronted
with
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
from
the
lead
industries
case
and
the
cases
that
followed
on,
which
gave
rise
to
the
delegation
problem.
and
so
it
is
true,
i
think,
justice
souter,
to
respond
to
your
question,
i
do,
just
like
general
waxman
had
to,
i
have
to
refer
to
the
statute
in
talking
about
the
intelligible
principle
and
i
will
do
so
this
morning
in
my
discussion.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
justice--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--if
i
may.
first,
we
are
saying
that
it
is
the
lead
industries
line
of
cases
that
created
the
delegation
problem
here.
we
do
argue
that
there
is
an
intelligible
principle
in
this
statute
that
derives
from
public
health,
from
requisite
to
protect
the
public
health.
there
are
a
number
of
other
words
in
the
statute
which
i
may
get
time
to
deal
with
in
my
second
argument
but
i
want
to
focus
right
now
on
public
health,
because
i
think
it
brings
clearly
into
focus
what
is
missing
from
general
waxman's
argument.
general
waxman
referred
to
medically
significant
risks
and
talked
about
the
american
thoracic
society.
he's
talking
as
if
the
statute
said
we
want
to
protect
personal
health.
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
what
the
statute
says
is
we
want
to
protect
public
health,
and
that
difference
is
terribly
significant
because
let
me
explain
what
happened
in
1970.
the
senate
bill
said
we
want
to
set
national
standards
which
will
protect
the
health
of
persons,
a
term
that
was
interchangeable
in
the
previous
act
with
health
of
any
persons.
the
house
had
a
bill
that
said,
no,
we
want
to
protect
public
health.
public
health
was
a
word
that
had
been
used
consistently
since
1955
in
the
statute
and
connoted
just
what,
as
we
say
in
our
briefs,
public
health
does
connote,
which
is
a
comprehensive
cost
included
evaluation
in
order
to
reduce
sickness
and
to
improve
longevity
of
the
population.
what
the
conference
committee
did
is
it
accepted
the
house
version,
public
health,
which
has
a
meaning
which
i'm
going
to
be
discussing
further
this
morning.
and
what
mr.
waxman
or
what
general
waxman
has
been
doing
this
morning
is
referring
to
legislative
history
from
the
senate
bill
from
which
he...
not
just
he,
i
don't
want
to
blame
mr.
waxman...
but
epa
has
derived
this
notion
of
medically
significant
risks.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
let
me
start
with
the
latter
part
of
your
question
and
then
kind
of
trip
back
to
some
of
the
things
you
said
previously.
first
of
all,
this
is...
the
congress
has
taken
no
action
with
respect
to
section
109(b).
we
all
know
that.
there
is
not
going
to
be
any
change
by
inaction
by
the
congress.
i
think
surely
that's
common
ground
for
everybody.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
but
congress
has
never,
has
never
done
anything
to
the
central
standard-setting
provision,
and
it
has
never
said
anything
which
is
different
than
what
i'm
saying
about
public
health.
and
i
think
for
a
very
good
reason.
let
me
just
kind
of
put
those
cases
in
context.
i
know
that
you
had
some
role
because
you
were
in
the
court
of
appeals
at
the
time.
but
lead
industries
involved
a
not
very
ubiquitous
pollutant.
lead
in
the
ambient
air
principally
resulted
from
gasoline
emissions
which
had
already
been
regulated
by
epa,
and
that
case
was
tried
very
much
as
a
technological
feasibility
case,
not
as
a
public
health
case
such
as
we
are
talking
about
here.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
standards
there
protected
public
health
in
the
very
sense
that
i'm
talking
about
in
my
argument
this
morning.
the
problem
with
the
decisions
following
lead
industries,
it's
not
that
lead
industries
on
those
facts
concerning
the
contentions
being
made
in
that
case
was
wrong.
it
is
rather
that
the
court
of
appeals
then
conflated
the
idea
of
technological
feasibility
with
the
question...
separate
question...
of
whether
cost
and
other
kinds
of
countervailing
considerations
can
be
taken
into
account
in
setting
the
standards
in
the
first
instance.
now,
with
respect...
and
let
me
go
ahead
and
say
here
we
are
with
the
two
most
ubiquitous
pollutants,
ozone
and
particulate
matter,
where
the
regulatory
scheme
requires
everything
i
said
in
my
first
moments
of
argument
this
morning
where
we
are
in
the
last
mile,
and
all
of
a
sudden
the
question
which
has
been
present
all
along
in
public
health
is
now
front
and
center.
now,
we
talk
about
the
implementation
process
here.
i
think
two
things
are
significant
about
what
general
waxman
had
to
say
about
this...
that
this
morning.
first
of
all,
i
think
he
is
conceding
logically
that
costs
must
play
a
role
or
else
he
wouldn't
be
making
this
argument
about
the
implementation
phase.
but
he
is
misstating
with
all
due
respect
what
this
court's
union
electric
decision
said.
what
the
union
electric
decision
says
is
that
the
standards
are
set
by
epa
and
they
cannot
be
changed
when
epa
approves
a
state
implementation
plan.
those
standards
are
set
and
whether
they
protect
public
health
or
not,
they
can't
be
changed
in
the
implementation
process.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
justice
souter,
if
i
may,
this
court's
decisions
very
clearly
distinguish
between
feasibility
analysis
and
cost/benefit
analysis.
now,
i
will
say,
recognizing
you
said
the
opposite,
cost
in
the
sense
of
cost/benefit
analysis
can
never
be
taken
into
account
in
the
implementation
process
at
all.
those
standards
are
set,
and
they
can't
be
modified
in
the
implementation.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
first
of
all,
i'm
going
to
be
talking
about
why
that
isn't
what
congress
wanted,
but
let
me
continue
on
the
implementation
part
of
this.
what
the
union
electric
case
says
is
that
only
the
states
can
even
look
at
these
questions
at
implementation,
and
then
they
can
only
look
at
them
and
say
who's
going
to
bear
the
burden
of
the
standards
that
are
already
set
by
epa.
i
call
it
triage,
but,
i
mean,
i
think
you
get
the
idea.
it's
essentially
who's
going
to
bear
the
burden.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
but
even
that's
not
true.
those
standards
have
to
be
met
by
the
deadlines
established
by
congress.
there
is
only...
this
kind
of
consideration
that
you
are
wishing
were
there
isn't
there.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
now,
but
that...
first
of
all,
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
common
ground
that
we
don't
construe
statutes
on
the
assumption
that
congress
will
change
them,
and
that
we
don't
construe
the
words,
because
it
seems
to
me
when
we
come
to
the
words
here,
we
come
back
to
what
really
went
on.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
well,
i
think,
the
distinction,
your
honor,
is
very
much
like
the
idea
of
managed
care.
i
mean,
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
world
of
limited
resources,
and
the
decision
is
being
made
on
the
population
as
a
whole.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
right.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
and--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--no.
i'm
saying
that
those
three
terms,
public
health,
environment,
and
the
economy,
overlap
and
interrelate
and
so
that
when...
when,
for
example,
congress
was
asking
for
advice
about
the
effects
on
the
environment,
they
were
not
excluding
effects
on
public
health
and
so,
too,
when
they
were
asking
for
effects
on
public
health,
they
were
not
excluding
effects
on
the
economy.
those
terms
are
obviously
set
up
in
such
a
way
that
the
advice...
they
are
not
mutually
exclusive--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--yes.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
we
are
not,
we
are
not
adding
factors.
we
are
adding
factors
that
countervail.
they're
on
the
other
side
of
the
equation.
could
i--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--justice
scalia,
with
all
respect,
i
think
that
when
you
add
countervailing
factors,
you
narrow
the
range
of
outcomes.
let
me
illustrate
by
just
and
reasonable
rates
which
we
talk
about
in
our
brief.
i
think
you'd
have
a
great
big
constitutional
problem
if
you
didn't
take
investor
interests
and
consumer
interests
and
weigh
them
one
against
the
other.
that's
what
hope
natural
gas
says.
it
upholds
that
delegation
precisely
because
we--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--yes.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
yes.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
justice
breyer,
the
judgment
is
informed
by
having
countervailing
factors.
that's
the
point.
this
is
different
because--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--justice
breyer,
i
don't
think
law
and
jurisprudence
requires
determinative
outcomes.
justice
scalia
likes
a
world
of
rules.
i
understand
that.
but
a
lot
of
law
is
standards.
a
lot
of
law
is--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--no,
i
think...
when
you
say
hold
the
rein
tight,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
public
health
necessarily
conveys
and
connotes
the
kind
of
countervailing
factors
that
i'm
talking
about.
that
does
not
mean
the
agency
lacks
discretion.
that
doesn't
mean,
just
as
justice
breyer
was
suggesting,
that
the
fpc,
when
it
sets
just
and
reasonable
rates,
is
pinned
down
to
6
cents
rather
than
5
cents.
that's
really
not
my
argument
at
all.
i'm
not
arguing
that
we're
going
to
get
to
a
solution
of
a
differential
equation.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
you
have
to
have
the
competing
factors.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
but
with
all
due
respect,
they
are
bucking
the
whole
regulatory
process,
because
what
they're
talking
about
is
characterizing
a
risk.
science
helps
to
characterize
risks,
i
don't
doubt
that.
the
question
is,
how
do
you
manage
risks?
when
you're
managing
risks
you've
got
to
take
into
account
countervailing
factors,
otherwise
you're
in
the
situation
that
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think,
pretty
aptly
described.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
but
with
all
respect,
your
honor,
they
are
managing
risks
when
they
set
those
standards
because
the
standards
can't
be
changed
in
the
implementation
process.
i
realize
i'm
just
folding
back
on
the
argument
i've
made
previously,
but
your--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--yes.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
no--
[laughter]
i
think
my
red
light's
on,
but
if
i
can
respond
to
this--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
no,
that's
not
what
i'm
saying
at
all.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
requisite
to
protect
the
public
health
itself,
in
this
statutory
context--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--yes.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court
again.
the...
i
don't
want
to
return
to
the
delegation
issue,
other
than
to
repeat
and
emphasize
that
this
agency
wishes
to
regulate
every
nook
and
cranny
of
this
environment
for
air
pollution
reasons,
and
yet
said
to
the
court
of
appeals,
nothing
in
the
statute
requires
her
to
make
any
specific
findings
or
to
structure
her
decision
making
in
any
particular
way.
now,
with
that
said,
i
want
to
turn
to
the
statute.
and
i
want
to
start
a
little
bit
out
of
order
because
in
my
first
argument,
i
intended,
i
didn't
get
a
chance
to
respond
to,
justice
o'connor's
colloquy
with
general
waxman.
you
asked,
justice
o'connor,
about
section
109(d)
of
the
act
which
requires
the
casac
committee
to
advise
the
administrator
on
any
adverse
public
health,
welfare,
social,
economic
and
so
forth
effects,
and
mr.
waxman
said
two
things
that
i
want
to
very
much
disagree
with.
he
said
that's
in
a
different
provision
of
the
statute.
well,
it's
not.
it's
in
the
standard
setting
provision.
it's
in
section
109.
it
refers
to
standard
setting,
and
entails
standard
setting.
secondly,
the
statute
makes
clear
in
the
judicial
review
provisions,
and
i'm
looking
at
pages
6-a
and
7-a
of
my
blue
brief,
that's
the
petitioner's
brief.
it
says
that
the
administrator
must
set
forth
a
statement
summarizing--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--i'm
now
on
page
7-a
and
i'm
looking
at
the
judicial
review
provision
which
is
section
307(d)(3)(c).
mr.
edward
w.
warren
it's
at
the
top
of
the...
yes,
yes.
in
other
words,
i'm
reading
about
the
statement
that
the
administrator
must
provide,
which
is
the
next
sentence,
and
it
says
it
must
set
forth
the
pertinent
findings,
recommendations
and
comments
and
so
forth,
and
if
her
proposal,
and
you'll
notice
it
says
section
109(d),
that's
7409(d)
is
all
of
section
109(d),
it's
not
excluding
out
the
parts
that
general
waxman
would
exclude
out.
what
it
says
is
that
she
has
to
say
where
she
differs
with
the
casac,
and
where
she
agrees
with
the
casac,
and
so
forth.
so
this
information
that
justice
o'connor,
you
referred
to
in
your
question,
is
very
much
part
of
the
standard
setting
process.
it's
very
much
part
of
what
the
administrator
has
to
say
when
she
promulgates
a
standard,
and
it's
very
much
part
of
the
judicial
review
provision.
now,
if
i
can
return
to
the
core
provisions
of
the
statute.
requisite
to
protect
the
public
health
with
an
adequate
margin
of
safety.
now,
i'm
going
to
talk
mostly
about
public
health
this
morning,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
there
aren't
other
words
that
you
should
pay
attention
to,
and
other
provisions
in
section
108
and
109.
i
just
would
like
to
focus
on
public
health
because
i
think
it's
so
doggone
central.
now,
what
does
it
mean
to
protect
the
public
health?
now,
public
health
is
not
defined
in
the
statute.
we
all
agree
on
that.
it
has
to
take
on
its
natural
and
ordinary
meaning
under
this
court's
decisions.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
agree
with
that
with
this
point
in
mind.
if
the
administrator
defines
public
health
so
that
it
excludes
all
countervailing
factors,
what
you
are
doing
is
handing
over
to
the
administrator
a
decision
of
far,
far-reaching
economic
and
political
significance,
and
under
this
court's
decisions,
the
mci
line
of
cases,
the
court
just
doesn't
presume
those
kinds
of
delegations
lightly,
so
my
point
would
be,
of
course,
the
administrator
in
this
provision
and
others
has
discretion,
but
it
doesn't
have
discretion--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--i
am
indeed.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
yes.
that's
what
the
lead
industry's
line
of
cases
says,
and
really
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
too.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
and
this
involves
the
protective
effect
and
ground
level
ozone,
held
that
the
statute
required
her
to
consider
that.
but,
but
what
i'm
saying
about
public
health,
and
i
want
to,
what
i'm
saying
about
public
health
is--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--yes.
she
does.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
well,
let's
put
it
this
way.
she
didn't
sake
cert
on
that
issue,
so
i
think
she,
she
has
acquiesced
in
that
point.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
no.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--well,
first
of
all,
they've
not
conceded
the
point
that
you're
making
but
let
me
address
it
in
terms
of
public
health.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
footnote
1
of
our
blue
brief
that
i
was
referring
to
again,
because
public
health,
as
i
think
everybody
knows
today,
is
a
discipline
which
examines
health
questions
in
terms
of
protecting
the
public
with
explicit
reliance
on
cost/benefit
considerations.
i
mean,
this
is
the
way
you
achieve
the
most
for
the
public,
and
that
is
by
taking
cost/benefit
considerations
into
account.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
but,
but
i
think
my
answer
to
you,
justice
scalia,
is
the
same
here
as
it
was
with
respect
to
section
312.
those,
those
things
that
are
mentioned
there
obviously
overlap.
i
mean,
they
infect
each
other
in
both
directions
and
it's
so
true,
so
is
true
of
public
health.
let
me
say
that
i
didn't
make
up
this
definition
of
public
health.
public
health
was
defined
most
prominently
by
the
head
of
the
public
health
school
at
yale,
and
his
definition
is
the
one
you
really
see
in
all
the
dictionaries.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
it
didn't
give
any.
that's
significant.
and
why
did
congress--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--no
what
i
really
think
it
was
relying
on
was
the
implicit
definition
of
public
health
in
the
act
before
1970.
let
me
focus
in
on
exactly
what
happened
again
because
i
think
it's
very
significant.
the
senate
came
up
with
a
bill
that
would
set
national
standards
to
protect
the
health
of
persons.
now,
that
expression
had
a
meaning
in
the
previous
act.
it
was
the
trigger
for
abatement
actions.
but
abatement
actions,
the
trigger
was
only
the
beginning.
you
then
weighed
against
the...
what's
necessary
to
protect
the
public,
to
protect
the
health
of
persons.
you
weighed
against
that
equitable
factors,
and
economic
factors
and
the
like.
the
house,
by
contrast,
used
the
term,
we're
going
to
set
standards
requisite
to
protect
the
public
health.
that
term
had
a
meaning
in
the
statute
as
well.
from
1955
on,
congress
used
the
word
public
health.
it
enlisted
the
public
health
service,
which
engages
in
exactly
the
kind
of
comparisons
i'm
talking
about
to
help
administer
the
statute
and
public
health
was
the
goal
to
be
achieved
when
you
weighed
the
health
of
persons
against
these
other
factors.
that's
implicit
also
in
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
i
see...
i
use
the
purpose
to
reinforce
what
public
health
means,
not
in
any
other,
in
any
other
way,
but
it
does
very
much
reinforce
it.
it's
really
what
justice
breyer
was
saying.
is
healthy
people
are
wealthier,
wealthy
people
are
healthier.
there
is
always
going
to
be
an
interaction
between
these
things.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
it's
close.
it's
close
to
what
you
said.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
justice
breyer,
i'm
glad
you
framed
the
question
that
way.
we
are
not
talking
about
econometrics.
we're
not
talking
about...
we're
talking
about
what
ben
franklin
called
prudential
algebra.
put
one
side
of
the
column
pros.
one
side
of
the
column
cons.
we
are
looking
at
an
analysis
just
like
you
see
in
the
presidential
executive
order
of
this
administration,
or
that
which
you
see
in
the
unfunded
mandate
act.
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
common
sense
weighing
of
competing
considerations
in
a
systematic
way.
that's
all
we're
talking
about.
the
executive
order,
as
i'm
sure
you
know--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--once
again,
with
all
due
respect,
we
have
a
very
detailed
regulatory
impact
analysis
here
which
does...
epa
knows
a
lot
about
the
costs
of
controlling
these
two
pollutants
because
it's
been
controlling
them
for
30
years,
so
it
knows
how
much
it's
going
to
cost
to
go
that
extra
step
and
that
extra
step,
and
there
is
an
evaluation
of
those
costs
in
the
regulatory
impact
analysis,
so
i
don't
think
it's
hard
to
get
a
handle
on
those
costs.
i'm
not
saying
that
any
answer
on
the
costs
or
the
benefits
is
precise.
the
agency
has
a
lot
of
discretion
on
that,
but
not
to
try,
i
think
is
ultimately
going
to
defeat
public
health.
it's
going
to
defeat
the
objectives
of
trying
to
achieve
more
good
for
the
public,
and
that's
what
this
statute's
all
about.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
not
at
all,
justice
ginsburg.
not
at
all.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
what
the
agency
can't
do
in
the
name
of
public
health
is
take
countervailing
factors
off
the
table.
but
in
carrying
out
its
responsibilities
to
achieve
the
public
health,
those
factors
are
weighed
on
the
pros
and
the
cons,
just
as
ben
franklin
was
talking
about,
and
we
have
a
process
which
is...
which
it
can
be
subjected
to
executive
branch
review,
which
is
going
to
cut
out
a
lot
of
the
problems,
to
congressional
review.
it
facilitates
what
congress
had
in
mind.
now,
let
me
also
go
forward
and
say
that
this
is--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--what
it
is,
is
what
every
other
health,
safety
and
environmental
agency
does.
we
don't
have
an
executive
order
reviewing
these
decisions
of
epa
and
osha,
and
nhtsa,
and
so
forth,
because
every
statute
has
been
interpreted
by
a
court
of
appeals
the
way
this
one
has.
the
norm
is
to
do
the
kind
of
weighing
and
balancing
i'm
talking
about.
now,
that's
not
to
say
that
if
a
regulation
passes
executive
branch
review
and
gets
by
congressional
oversight,
that
there
won't
be
judicial
review,
but
the
agency
is
going
to
have
a
lot
of
discretion
with
respect
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence
questions,
questions
about
which
costs
can
be
quantified,
which
costs
can't
be
quantified,
how
to
quantify
them,
how
to
quantify
the
benefits.
all
those
questions
are
questions
which
would
come
up
in
the...
in
any
subsequent
review
or
could
come
up
in
any
subsequent
review,
but
the
agency's
discretion
is
going
to
be
honored.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
i
think
there's
a
common
theme
between
these
two
portions
of
the
argument.
on
the
first
part
that
i'm
arguing,
i
will
give
it
to
epa
that
it's
constrained
by
lead
industry
and
this
line
of
cases
from
doing
what
i
think
is
required
by
the
statute
to
do,
but
nonetheless
it
hasn't
fought
very
hard
to
accomplish
the
aims
that
i'm
talking
about.
so
when
congress
gives
it
general
direction,
it
doesn't
seem
to
want
to
follow
it.
and
then
when
congress
gives
it
very
specific
direction,
it
doesn't
want
to
follow
it
either,
so
that's
what
i
think...
that's
the
common
theme
here
i
think
of
an
agency
that
wants
to
do
what
it
wants
to
do,
and
not
what
congress
directed
it
to
do.
i
think
that
that's,
that's
the
common--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--not
to
do
it.
no.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
no.
and
that's
exactly--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--no.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
because
the
agency,
what
the
agency
doesn't
have
discretion
to
do,
it's
got
a
lot
of
discretion,
and
i
have
emphasized
that
these
decisions
are
going
to
be
reviewed,
you
know,
under
the
scheme
i'm
talking
about
under
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
test,
but
the
one
thing
it
doesn't
have
discretion
to
do
is
to
take
all
those
countervailing
factors
off
the
table
because
what
that
is
doing,
and
this
feeds
right
back
into
the
delegation
doctrine
where
they
say
they
have
to
make
no
findings
and
so
forth,
as
i
alluded
to,
what
that
means
is
that
the
agency
has
the
freedom
to
take
us
all
the
way
down
to
deindustrialization,
as
the
court
of
appeals
said.
that
can't
be.
this
court's
decisions
at
mci,
benzene
i
think
stands
for
the
same
proposition.
there
has
to
be
some
common
sense
brought
to
bear.
there
has
to
be
some
determination
of
what
risks
are
acceptable,
what
risks
are
not.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
we
don't
need
to...
we
don't
need...
the
problem
that
i'm
talking
about,
whether
the
standards
make
sense
in
terms
of
public
health,
whether
they
really
help
public
health
is
not
something
congress
has
ever,
ever,
ever
addressed
through
oversight.
never
addressed
that.
all
it's
done
is
extended
some
deadlines.
it's
a
completely
different
question
because
the
question,
and
we're
in
the
last
mile.
i
want
to
emphasize
that.
this
is
not
1970.
this
is
2000.
and
we've
been
regulating
these
pollutants
for
years.
we've
done
lots
and
lots
of
things,
and
this
issue
of
whether
or
not
it's
worth
the
candle
in
terms
of
public
health
is
coming
sharply
into
focus.
it's
come
sharp...
much
more
sharply
into
focus
as
a
result
of
things
like
the
executive
orders
that
have,
have
been
in
place
for
the
last
20
years.
it's
come
more
sharply
into
focus
because
of
the
unfunded
mandate
act.
that's
where
we
are
today.
but
this
is
something
that
congress
has
never
addressed,
and
can't
fix.
or
can't
fix
without
rewriting
the
statute,
which
it
doesn't
need
to
do
because
for
the
reasons
i've
talked
about,
congress
had
it
right
in
the
first
place.
it
didn't
pass
the
senate
bill
to
protect
the
health
of
persons.
it
passed
the
house
bill,
which
said
protect
public
health,
and
public
health
had
meaning,
just
as
i'm
outlining
it
here
today,
and
that
meaning,
and
i
talked
about
this
definition,
but
the
name
of
that
book
is
the...
it's
either
the
"cost
of
sickness
and
the
price
of
health.
"
or
the
other
way
around.
i
always
get
it
confused.
but
the
point
is
is
that
in
this
century,
the
leaders
of
the
public
health
tradition
have
been
looking
at
these
things,
and
for
good
reasons.
you
know,
you
don't
spend
money
foolishly
and
unwisely
to
achieve
a
pittance
when
you
can
use
your
money
much
more
wisely
and
better
to
achieve
more.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
yes.
public
health
means--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--yes.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
well,
okay.
let
me
try
this
for
you.
public
health
contemplates
a
consideration
of
competing
factors,
including
costs,
in
seeking
to
reduce
population
sickness
and
increase
longevity.
i
think
that
says
it
in
a
sentence,
what
i
think
i
have
borne
out
by
that
definition
of
public
health.
when
this
act
was
passed,
and
today.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
i
do.
i
do
think
it
would
comply
with
the
delegation
doctrine,
and
it's
really,
as
i
was
saying
to
justice
breyer,
when
you
have
countervailing
factors,
it's
not
adding
factors,
factors,
factors,
it
is
the
fact
that
the
factors
countervail.
it's
one
against
the
other.
that
narrows
discretion
and
i
gave
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
as
an
example,
and
i
think
if
we
had
the
analogous
situation
before
us
of
a
court
of
appeals
that
said
in
setting
just
and
reasonable
rates
we're
only
going
to
look
at
the
consumer
interest,
the
logic
would
take
us--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--as
interpreted.
because
the
difference
between
what
i
read
and
let
me
read
it
again.
public
health
contemplates
consideration
of
competing
factors,
including
costs,
in
seeking
to
reduce
population
sickness
and
increase
longevity.
what
the
lead
industry's
case
does
is
it
takes
all
of
the
first
part
of
that
sentence
off
the
table.
it
says
you
cannot
consider
those
things.
and
i
don't
frankly
know
how
in
a
world
of
limited
resources,
whether
it's
air
pollution
or
whether
it's
managed
care,
how
we
can
make
these
decisions
if
we
don't
think
about
what
risks
are
acceptable.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
yes,
it
was.
and
two
things
on
that.
one,
there
is
no
stare
decisus
effect.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
well,
i
think
that,
that
we...
there's
several
things
you
can
say
about
that.
i
think
we
have
not
addressed
the
sort
of
last
mile
problems
that
we
have
here
today.
i
think
when
you
say
that
we
have
lived
with
it,
that
does--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--right.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
well,
what
i
mean,
what
i
mean,
your
honor,
okay,
too
much
shorthand,
but
what
i
mean
is
that
both
ozone
and
particulate
matter
have
been
regulated
very
extensively
for
a
number
of
years
and
take
automobile
emissions,
for
example,
what
we
have
done
is
we've,
we're
now,
we
are
in
the
last
1
percent
of
control.
so
the
costs
and
the
benefits,
and
the
same
could
be
true
of
utility
scrubbers
or
a
number
of
other
things
because
we've
done
this
kind
of
regulation,
but
let
me
say
that--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--well,
first
of
all,
i
think
the
health-health
balance
really
won't
work,
taking
particulate
matter
because
i
think
you
have
the
same
problems.
it's
just
another
form
of
a
zero
risk
standard.
what
you
are
doing
is
you
are
netting
out
any
countervailing
considerations,
but
there's
really
no
place
to
stop
until
you
have
gone
all
the
way
down
to
zero
for
pollutants
like
this
which
are
nonthreshold
pollutants.
let
me
continue.
lead
industries,
as
i
indicated,
i
don't
think
on
the
facts
was
wrongly
decided.
that
was
really--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--right.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
right,
but
let
me...
i
take
the
central
bank
of
denver
case
as
probably
the
best
one
to
talk
about
because
this
court
held
no
stare
decisus
effect
and
overturned
a
decision
where
11
courts
of
appeals
had
come
out
the
other
way,
and
everybody
had
been
living
with
aider
and
abettor
liability
under
10(b)(5)
of
the
'34
securities
act
for
decades,
and
yet
this
court
said
that's
not
what
the
statute
said,
so
this
court
is
in
a
position
to
read
the
statute
and
make
sense
of
the
statute,
as
i
am
suggesting.
now,
i
don't
think
lead
industries
really
has
worked.
that's
not
to
say,
and
i'm
not
saying,
although
i
don't
know
that
the
existing
standards
have
benefits
that
exceed
the
costs.
i
have
a
pretty
good
sense
then
in
the
first
decade
of
the
statute,
there
wasn't
much
question
about
that,
that
one
of
the
reasons
this
thing
didn't
come
sharply
into
focus
in
lead
industries
is
because
we
were
at
the
early
stages
and
it
made
a
lot
of
sense
to
do
what
was
being
done.
but
at
this
stage,
i
don't
think
health-health
tradeoffs
really
are
the
answer
because
for
the
very
reason
you're
suggesting,
the
costs
are
important
because
the
resources,
and
even
in
a
rich
society
like
this
one,
we
do
have
limited
resources
and
those
resources
can
be
better
used
elsewhere.
i
mean,
there
is
no
even
attempt
to
reconcile
the
ozone
standard
in
the
particulate
matter
and
the
other
ambient
standards
in
terms
of
providing
a
comparable
degree
of
protection,
even
without
any
regard
to
costs.
for
example,
taking
the
benzene
case
as
an
example,
where
you
know,
you
had
occupational
carcinogens
and
could
you
look
at
the
risks
and
could
you
at
least
make
some
comparison,
you
note
none
of
that
is
even
attempted
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
but,
the
first
point
is,
you
got
to
construe
the
statute.
and
i
think
the
statute
has
to
be
construed
against
the
backdrop
of
the
mci
benzene--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
--okay.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
right.
mr.
edward
w.
warren
but
justice
souter,
you
are
presupposing
by
the
question
i
think
that
everything
is
like
ozone.
let's
just
take
particulate
matter
and
let's
assume
for
a
minute
that
there
is
no
countervailing
factors
that
there's
risks
all
the
way
down
to
zero.
you
had
the
same
indeterminancy
problem.
let's
take
ozone,
where
there
are
going
to
be
countervailing
factors
to
some
degree,
but
where
you
still
have
the
same
problem,
where
you
are
going...
are
you
really
protecting
public
health
if
you
push
it
down
to
a
level
where
the
costs
greatly
exceed
the
benefits.
that's
really
what
the
regulatory
impact
analysis
says
here.
let
me
make
one
more
point.
maybe
i
should
reserve
the
balance.
i
know
i'm--
mr.
edward
w.
warren
your
honors,
the
cotton
dust
case,
which
did
construe
section
38,
said
that
cost/benefit
analysis
either
permitted
or
required
by
section
38
of
that
statute,
it
was
ruled
out
only
because
the
statute
provided
a
feasibility
analysis.
that's
the
only
thing
that
ruled
it
out.
the
examples
that
mr.
waxman,
or
general
waxman
gave
are
all
feasibility
examples.
he
concedes
that
the
standard
itself
cannot
be
changed
after
it
is
set,
and
lastly,
we
have
acted
as
if
this
provision
has
made
sense
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
american
lung
association
case,
which
shows
that
this
interpretation
of
the
statute
makes
no
sense
from
any
perspective.
that
was
a
case
where
the
agency
refused
to
regulate
sulfur
oxides.
lastly,
i
would
call
to
the
court's
attention
the
state
of
michigan
state
as
an
example
where
there
was--
