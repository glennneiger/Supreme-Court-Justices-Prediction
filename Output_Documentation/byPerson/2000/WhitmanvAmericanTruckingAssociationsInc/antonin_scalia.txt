justice
antonin
scalia
does
she
acknowledge
that
you
have
to
consider
the
effect
of
particulates
in
our
ozone
in
reducing
ultraviolet
rays,
for
example?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
provision
you
just,
you
just
quoted
to
us
at
the
beginning
of
your
presentation
here,
which
says
that
the
committee
has
to
advise
the
administrator
of
any
adverse
public
health,
welfare,
social,
economic,
or
energy
effects,
which
may
result
from
various
strategies.
but
you
know,
they
take
the
pain
to
separate
public
health
from
economic.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
warren,
i
must
say
that
to
the
extent
you
win
this
argument
that
you're
making
now,
you
sort
of
weaken
your
argument
on,
concerning
the
ability
of
epa
to
issue
revised
ozone
standards,
because
frankly,
what
makes
it
eminently
plausible
that
congress
might
have
itself
set
a
fixed
table
that
can't
be
changed
by
epa
is
the
scary
idea
that
if
epa
can
issue
revised
standards,
god
knows
what
it
might
issue.
it
doesn't
have
to
take
into
account
anything
but
public
health,
and
you
know,
it
could
go
down
to
transient
costs,
and
if
that's
what
the
scheme
is,
i
can
understand
why
congress
would
say
in
part
ii,
no,
look
it,
with
ozone,
it
affects
everything,
it
affects
every
industry.
we
are
going
to,
we
are
going
to
import
ourselves
some
cost/benefit
analysis
and
we
are
going
to
set
this
table,
and
epa
can't
change
it.
now,
if
you
tell
me
that
when
epa
changes
it,
epa
also
has
to
take
into
account
whether
it's
going
to
bring
us
back
to
the
stone
age,
then...
then
it's
a
little
less
plausible
that
congress
should
have,
should
have
stepped
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
problem.
i
mean,
if
epa
goes
too
far,
it
looks
like
things
are
going
too
far,
congress
will
step
in
and
enact
part
ii
with
a
fixed
table
1
that
epa
can't
depart
from.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
had
assumed
that
it
meant
you
couldn't
go
over
those
levels
during
eight-hour
period
in
the
day.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
a
matter
of
averaging
it
over
the
eight
hours
rather
than
averaging
it
for
one
hour.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
wasn't
aware,
i
wasn't
aware
that
they
could
extend
the
time
beyond,
beyond
what
congress
has
prescribed.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
what
was
neither
necessary,
nor
important?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
first
of
these
was
actually
two
consolidated
cases,
no.
99-1257,
whitman
versus
american
trucking
associations,
and
no.
99-1426,
american
trucking
associations
versus
whitman.
these
cases
come
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
section
109
of
the
clean
air
act
requires
petitioner,
the
administrator
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
to
promulgate
and
periodically
to
revise
as
necessary,
national
ambient
air
quality
standards
for
each
pollutant
for
which
air
quality
criteria
have
been
issued
under
section
108
of
the
act.
these
cases
arose
when
in
1997,
petitioner
revised
the
ozone
and
particulate
matter
standards,
and
respondents
in
no.
99-1257
challenged
the
revised
standards
on
several
grounds.
the
dc
circuit
accepted
some
of
the
challenges
and
rejected
others.
it
held
that
section
109(b)(1)
as
interpreted
by
the
administrator
delegated
legislative
power
to
the
administrator
in
contravention
of
the
federal
constitution.
it
held
further
that
the
epa
may
not
consider
the
costs
of
implementing
an
air
quality
standard
when
deciding
the
level
at
which
to
set
the
standard,
and
finally
the
court
held
that,
although
certain
implementation
provisions
for
the
ozone
standards
contained
in
subpart
2
of
the
clean
air
acts
part
regarding
nonattainment
areas
did
not
prevent
the
epa
from
revising
the
ozone
standard.
nonetheless
those
provisions
rather
than
more
general
provisions
contained
in
subpart
1
of
that
part,
constrained
the
implementation
of
the
new
ozone
standards.
the
court
rejected
the
argument
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction
to
reach
the
implementation
question
because
there
had
been
no
final
implementation
action.
we
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part.
first,
we
hold
that
section
109(b)
does
not
permit
the
administrator
to
consider
implementation
costs
in
setting
air
quality
standards.
section
109(b)(1)
instructs
the
epa
to
set
air
quality
standards
“the
attainment
and
maintenance
of
which
are
requisite
to
protect
the
public
health
with
an
adequate
margin
of
safety.”
implementation
costs
are
not
expressly
included
in
that
equation
and
we
will
not
infer
a
provision
for
costs,
from
ambiguous
terms
such
as
requisite
and
adequate
margin.
section
109(b)(1)
is
the
engine
that
drives
nearly
all
of
title
i
of
the
caa
and
congress
does
not
alter
a
regulatory
scheme’s
fundamental
details
in
vague
terms
or
ancillary
provisions.
moreover,
the
caa
often
expressly
grants
the
epa
authority
to
consider
implementation
costs
and
such
costs
are
both
so
indirectly
related
to
the
public
health
and
so
full
of
potential
for
cancelling
the
conclusions
drawn
from
direct
health
effects
that
they
would
have
been
expressly
mentioned
in
section
109,
had
congress
meant
them
to
be
considered.
other
caa
provisions,
which
do
require
cost
data
to
be
generated
or
considered,
have
no
bearing
upon
whether
costs
are
to
be
taken
account
of
in
setting
the
standards.
so,
because
the
text
of
109(b)(1)
in
its
context
is
clear,
we
have
no
cause
to
apply
the
canon
of
construing
taxes
to
avoid
serious
constitutional
problems.
second,
if
you
have
gotten
all
of
that
we
hold
that
section
109(b)(1)
does
not
delegate
legislative
power
to
the
epa.
when
congress
confers
decision
making
authority
upon
agencies
it
must
lay
down
our
cases
say
an
intelligible
principle
to
which
the
person
or
body
authorized
to
act
is
directed
to
confirm.
this
is
peculiarly
a
task
for
congress.
an
agency
cannot
cure
an
unlawful
delegation
of
legislative
power
by
adopting
in
its
discretion
a
limiting
construction
of
the
statute.
section
109(b)(1)
requires
the
administrator
to
set
air
quality
standards
at
a
level
that
is
neither
greater
nor
less
than
that
which
is
required
to
protect
the
public
health
from
the
adverse
effects
of
the
pollutant
in
the
ambient
air.
the
limits
that
109(b)(1)
thus
imposes
on
the
epa’s
discretion
are
strikingly
similar
to
the
limits
we
approved
in
our
recent
decision
in
touby
v
united
states
and
the
scope
of
discretion
that
109(b)(1)
allows
is
well
within
the
outer
limits
of
our
nondelegation
precedents.
contrary
to
respondent’s
argument,
statutes
need
not
provide
a
determinate
criterion
for
saying,
how
much
of
a
regulated
harm
is
too
much
to
avoid
delegating
legislative
power.
third,
we
find
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
jurisdiction
under
section
307
of
the
clean
air
act
to
consider
the
implementation
issue
involving
subparts
1
and
2.
the
implementation
policy
constitutes
final
agency
action
under
section
307
because
it
marked
the
consummation
of
the
epa’s
decision
making
process,
and
the
policy
is
right
for
review
because
the
question
it
presents
is
purely
one
of
statutory
interpretation
that
would
not
benefit
from
further
factual
development.
review
will
not
interfere
with
further
administrative
development
and
the
hardship
on
respondent
states
in
developing
state
implementation
plans
satisfies
the
caa’s
special
judicial
review
provision
permitting
pre
enforcement
review.
beyond
all
this,
we
find
that
the
implementation
issue
was
fairly
included
within
the
challenges
to
the
final
ozone
rule
that
were
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
all
parties
agreed
that
that
rule
is
final
agency
action
ripe
for
review.
finally,
we
hold
that
the
epa’s
implementation
policy
is
unlawful.
the
statutory
issue
is
which
of
the
caa’s
implementation
provisions
for
nonattainment
areas
applies
to
the
revised
ozone
standards,
subpart
1
or
subpart
2.
under
our
chevron
decision
if
the
statute
resolves
the
issue,
we
of
course
must
follow
the
statute,
but
if
the
statute
is
ambiguous
we
must
defer
to
a
reasonable
agency
interpretation
of
the
ambiguity.
here
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
concerning
the
interaction
between
subpart
1
and
subpart
2,
but
we
do
not
defer
to
the
epa’s
interpretation
because
it
is
unreasonable.
the
principle
distinction
between
the
subparts
is
that
subpart
2
eliminates
regulatory
discretion
allowed
by
subpart
1,
yet
the
epa’s
interpretation
would
render
subpart
2’s
carefully
designed
restrictions
on
epa
discretion
nugatory,
once
the
new
ozone
national
air
ambient
quality
standard,
naaqs
has
been
promulgated.
an
agency
may
not
construe
a
statute
in
a
way
that
completely
nullifies
textually
applicable
provisions
meant
to
limit
its
discretion.
in
addition,
although
subpart
2
was
obviously
written
to
govern
implementation
for
sometime
into
the
future,
nothing
in
the
epa’s
interpretation
would
have
prevented
the
agency
from
aborting
the
subpart
the
day
after
it
was
enacted.
we
therefore,
find
the
interpretation
unlawful.
we
leave
to
the
epa
the
task
of
developing
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
two
subparts.
