justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
if
that's
so,
maybe
that
ends
it
because
why
isn't
it
a
perfectly
good,
public
health
must
mean
basically
public
health.
not
the
cost
of
obtaining
public
health.
basically.
i
mean
just
saying
basically
in
the
ordinary
case,
and
then,
of
course,
you
could
have
some
unusual
cases
where
in
fact
what
people
like
to
say
is
we
are
going
to
go
back
to
the
stone
age,
which
was
very
unhealthy
for
people,
so,
that
if
in
fact
the
administrator
has
the
authority,
not
necessarily
the
requirement,
to
take
into
account
the
health
effects
of
either
the,
you
know,
we've
seen
the
skin
cancer
referred
to
a
lot
in
the
briefs,
and
i
guess
if
you
really
destroyed
the
economy,
that
would
have
adverse
health
effects.
i
don't
know
you're...
i
don't
know
if
the
other
side
agrees
on
that.
but
if
i'm
thinking
that
the
administrator
has
the
authority,
not
the
requirement,
in
unusual
cases
in
a
technology-forcing
statute
to
take
into
account
the
possibility
that
despite
the
technology
forcing,
etcetera,
you
could
hurt
the
public
health,
because
we
are
going
back
to
the
stone
age.
i
mean,
if
that
kind
of
reading
of
the
statute,
does
that
satisfy
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
alright.
why
isn't
it,
however,
a
correct
reading,
which
isn't
quite
what
they
proposed,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
sure
i
was
saying
that,
but
they--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
mean,
what
i
don't
see
to
be
direct
about
it
is
how
you
import
a
cost/benefit
analysis
into
this
statute.
i
mean,
cost/benefit
analysis
is
a
formal
discipline.
it's
very
complicated.
it's
very
time-consuming,
and
if
you
were
going
to
have
that
formal
discipline
in
this
statute,
why
would
they
just
use
the
words
public
health?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
difficulty,
i
guess
would
be
you
could
put
in
certainly,
i
imagine,
the
economic
considerations
if
perhaps...
if
they're
related
to
health
considerations,
i
can
see
how
a
person
might
do
that
where
small
risks
are
involved.
i
could
understand
that.
how
to
do
it.
what
i
don't
really
see
is
how
you
do
that
if
the
statute
is
technology-forcing.
i
mean,
because
you
wouldn't
know
really
what
the
costs
are
that
are
being
foreseen
with
the
technology
that
doesn't
yet
exist.
it
would
be
pretty
hard
to
write
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
the
agency
have
the
authority...
you
were
saying
what
discretion
they
have.
they
have
wide
discretion
after
they
do
this
common-sense
balancing
of
whatever
things.
that
was
your
view,
right?
do
they
also
have
the
discretion
not
to
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
to
take
any
of
these
things
into
account.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
supposing
that
the
epa
administrator
thinks,
you
know,
it's
going
to
be
a
three-week
hearing
just
to
begin,
and
by
the
time
i
get
finished
reading
all
that
stuff
on
the
costs,
etcetera,
it's
going
to
be
another
year
and
i'll
never
get
this
job
done
and
i
doubt
that
it
has
much
to
do
with
the
outcome.
is
the
epa
administrator
then
have
the
authority
to
say
i
don't
want
to
do
it,
i
don't
want
to
get
into
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
when
you
get
down
to
that,
at
the
last
1
percent
or
whatever,
it
is
you're
going
to
get
into
an
area
of
fuzzy
science.
you're
going
to
find
health
effects
on
both
sides
as
you're
finding
in
this
case
apparently,
and
so
therefore,
if
that's
what
you
are
worried
about,
you
don't
need
your...
you
don't
need
more
than
the
health
balance,
and
if
you
are
not
talking
about
that,
lead
industry
seems
to
have
worked.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that
is
a
little
ambiguous,
the
presence
of
a
certain
degree
of
ozone
in
the
air,
according
to
dot,
is
necessary
to
prevent
melanoma.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
you
took
it
out,
then
there
would
be
more
melanoma,
and
you
count
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
you
don't
in
your
brief
and
i
don't
really
see
the
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i'm
not
sure
it's
important,
it
might
be.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
happens
if
it
turns
out
because
of
science
that
the
internal
combustion
engine
does
always
affect
somebody
and
so
that
having
cars
will
have
some
adverse
health
effects,
but
what
is
the
epa
supposed
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
left
out
three
words.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
reason
that
i
ask,
it
says
the
presence
of
such
pollution
in
the
ambient
air
in
varying
quantities.
in
varying
quantities.
so
i
thought,
given
that
word,
that
there
is
no
effect
that
the
epa
administrator
can't
take
into
account
if
that
effect
is
a
public
health
effect,
and
is
different
at
different
quantities.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
that
is
correct,
then
mightn't
it
be
factually
true,
i
mean,
that
if
you
were
going
to
electric
cars,
or
you're
really
going
to
change
the
whole
economy,
the
chances
of
the
costs
being
so
fantastic
that
they
have
serious
adverse
health
effects
are
fairly
high,
and
the
saving
might
be
fairly
low
in
terms
of
health.
maybe
that
isn't
so.
