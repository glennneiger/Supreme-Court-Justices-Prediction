what
about
the
definition
the
congress
gave?
it
didn't
give
any?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
think
this
was
relying
on
this
prestigious
person
at
yale,
and
not
on
the
epa?

mr.
warren,
may
i
ask
with
respect
to
this
add
some
kind
of
cost/benefit
analysis,
what
kind
we
don't
know.
you
just
mentioned
benjamin
franklin
as
one
source
of
this.
it
seems
to
me,
to
put
it
bluntly,
that
you
would
have
on
your
scheme
as
a
target
for
attack
not
only
the
public
health
as
it
has
been
conceived
as
something
discrete
from
cost/benefit
analysis,
but
what
kind
of
cost/benefit
analysis
this
should
be.
did
epa
weigh
the
right
factors.
it
just
seems
to
me
that
you
are
adding
something
that
will
create
another
morass,
many
more
things
that
can
be
attacked
than
under
the
lead
industry's
regime.

if
i
knew
what
the
"it"
was.
i
mean,
you
said
this
is
not
fancy
cost/benefit
analysis.
it's
something...
well,
what
is
it
exactly?
