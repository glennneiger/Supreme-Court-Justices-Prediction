what
if...
what
if
the
tax
were
imposed,
or
a
tax
were
imposed
on
the
hotel
itself
instead
of
the
guests?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there...
does
the
hotel
have
to
get
any
license
or
permission
from
the
tribe
to
operate
under
the
federal
statutes
governing
indian
traders?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
though
in
conducting
the
hotel
it
isn't
dealing
with
members
of
the
tribe?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
i
remember
correctly,
cameron
and
cameron
trading
post
are
right
on
the
main
highway
from
flagstaff
up
to
the
grand
canyon.
and
it
goes
through
the
reservation,
but
this
is
the
main
highway
that
everybody
takes
going
up
there.
and
a
visitor
wanting
to
stay
overnight
who
is
not
a
tribal
member
can
drive
on
the
highway
right
into
the
cameron
trading
post
without
ever
entering
reservation
land
at
all,
spend
the
night,
get
up
the
next
day,
and
go
on
up
to
the
grand
canyon
or
to
flagstaff.
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
without
ever
being
on
reservation
land.
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it
may
make
it
a
lot
closer
to
strate...
i
mean,
the
hotel
itself
is
owned
by
a
nontribal
member
and
is
located
on
nontribal
land.
and
so
it's
maybe
closer
to
strate.
do
you
think
this
follows...
this
follows
within
one
of
the
two
montana
case
exceptions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what's...
what's
the
consensual
relationship
of
the
hotel
guests
with
the
tribe?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
presumably
for
the
hotels
that
are
not
on
fee
land,
at
least,
they
are
not...
the
guests
are
not
paying
a
state
tax
or
a
county
tax.
are
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
the
reservation
trust
land.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
have...
is
there
anything
on
the
record
to
tell
us
about
that?
that
surprises
me,
because
generally
transactions
on
trust
land
might
be
dealt
with
differently
in
terms
of
state
and
county
taxes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
nonmember
owned
hotels
on
trust
land.
how
about
member
owned
hotels?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
say
it
falls
on
the
guest.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
record
somewhere
discloses
this?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
didn't
that
deal
with
the
trading
post...
the
little
markets
that
sell
things?
that
wasn't
the
hotel
operation
in
ashcroft,
was
it?
