may
i
just
interrupt
this?
how
do
you
work
in
the
jicarilla
tax
on
the
oil
company
into
your
reasoning?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
and
the
outcome
is
they'd
been
given
a
lease
to
take
the
oil
out,
so
they
did
have
a
property
interest
in
the
oil
wells.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
made
before
the
tax
was
imposed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
wondering
how
you
reconcile
the
majority's
holding
with
your
position
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cole,
can
i
go
back
to
kind
of
a
basic
question.
sometimes
tribes
when
they
have
a
reservation
they
have
the
power
to
exclude
non
indians
from
the
reservation.
would
this
tribe,
in
your
view,
have
the
right...
have
the
power
to
decide
we're
not
going
to
let
any
non
indian
tourists
in
the
navajo
reservation.
we
want
to
keep
it
for
tribal
members?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
doesn't
it
have
that
power?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
all
those
hotels
pay
the
occupancy
tax?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gomez,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
how
far
your
position
would
extend?
we've
had
cases
that
i
remember
from
time
to
time,
what
we
call
checkerboard
reservations
where
about
half
the
land
might
be
owned
by
non
indians,
and
about
half
by
tribal
members.
and
in
those
cases,
one
of
the
concerns
was
that
taxation
without
representation
with
the
nonmembers
being
taxed
without
having
a
voice
in
opposing
the
tax.
would
your
rule
apply,
regardless
of
the
percentage
if
the
reservation
was
owned
by
nonmembers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
a
specific...
navajo
reservation
specific
case,
in
other
words,
not
a
general
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
the
next
case
involves
one
where
eighty
five
percent
is
held
in
trust,
what
will
we
do
with
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
each
case
would
be
fact
specific.
