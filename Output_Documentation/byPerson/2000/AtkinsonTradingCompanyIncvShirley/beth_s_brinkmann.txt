ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
case
is
not
the
strate
case
because
in
the
strate
case
there
was
no
privilege
to
which
the
tribe
could
attach
a
condition
or
a
tax.
here,
that
was
a
just
a
regulation
of
conduct
between
two
individuals.
here,
there
is
a
privilege
of
trade
on
the
reservation.
it
is
the
transaction
that
gives
rise
to
the
subject
of
federal
regulations
that
gives
rise--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
the
record
is
clear
that,
in
fact,
they
do
trade
with
indians
on
the
reservation.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
don't
believe
that's...
they
say
that
one
or
two
percent
of
their...
the
total
sales.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
don't--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
your
honor,
that's
not
quite
what
i'm
saying.
i
think
i
have
three
responses
to
make
to
that.
first
of
all,
the
percentage
is
the
record
is
the
sales.
that
doesn't
account
for
the
number
of
customers.
the
indian
customers
here
are
primarily
at
the
grocery
store,
the
convenience
store.
they're
not
the
overnight
guests.
however
there
is
also
record
evidence
that
there
have
been
indians
who
have
been
overnight
guests...
there
was
some
conference
down
there
where
indians
did
stay
at
the
hotel.
in
the
ashcroft
case
that
my
cocounsel
mentioned,
petitioner
litigated
this
issue
to
the
ninth
circuit,
and
this
court
denied
review.
and
in
that
case
they
challenged
the
applicability
of
the
particular
reservation
business
regulations
that
apply
to
three
reservations
that
are
applicable
here...
the
navajo,
the
zuni,
and
the
hopi.
those
are
detailed
regulations
that
apply
to
all
reservation
businesses.
a
reservation
business
is
defined
as
anyone
who
is
engaging
in
business
on
these
reservations
with
indians,
but
those
regulations--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
it's
25
c.f.r.
141,
and
the
following
sections.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
would
say
two
things.
we
think
that
that--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--we
think
that
that
makes
the
consent
prong
perhaps
a
more
complicated
analysis,
your
honor,
but
we
do
believe
because
the
guest
is
engaging
in
a
transaction
that
cannot
exist
but
for
the
license
that
has
to
be
obtained
under
these
regulations--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
two
things,
your
honor.
there
are
other
provisions
of
the
statute
i'll
refer
to
in
a
moment.
there
is
also
statutory
direct
authority
for
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
promulgate
regulations
which
control
here.
the
other
provisions
are--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes,
your
honor.
on...
statutory
authority
comes
from
sections
2
and
9
of
title
25
to
promulgate
regulations.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it's
in...
the
regulations
in
the
statute
are,
your
honor...
this
is
simply
the
authority
to
promulgate
the
regulations.
in
title
25
it
refers
to
the
authority
specifically
to...
for
the
secretary
to
promulgate
these
regulations,
and
it
is
to
regulate
trade
with
the
indians.
those
regulations,
then,
apply
to
all
traders
that
deal
with
indians.
section
2
provides
the--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
that
was
the
question
that
was
litigated
in
the
ashcroft
case.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
i
was
just
explaining,
however,
that
the
claim
there
was
that
these
regulations
should
not
apply
because
they
do
not
deal
primarily
with
indians.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
it
was
the
business
which
includes
all
of
these
operations,
we
believe
your
honor.
but
the
point
is
this,
when
congress
enacted
the
statute
to
control
trade
with
the
indians
and
gave
the
commissioner
expressed
authority
to
promulgate
regulations
thereunder.
in
the
1970s
these
tribes
complained
that
those...
that
there
were
not
sufficiently
adequate
regulations
promulgated
thereunder,
and
that
led
to
the
promulgation
of
25
c.f.r.
section
141.
those
regulations,
which
are
not
challenged
here,
are
key
we
believe
to
this
case
because
they
do
govern
the
business
relations
of
all
reservation
businesses.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
section
2
and
section
9.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
and
then
the
substantive
regulations
governing
the
indian
trader
statutes
are
sections
261
through
264,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
the
regulations...
the
statutory
authority
is
to
regulate
trade
with
the
indians.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
and
to...
and
to
introduce,
for
example,
goods
into
that
area.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
your
honor,
we
believe
they
do.
in
the
regulations--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--in
the
regulations
governing
the
navajo
business
reservations...
in
those
provisions,
it
expressly
provides
that
for
an
indian
trader
to
apply
for
a
license,
it
has
to
include
any
approval
that
is
required
by
tribal
or
federal
regulations.
it
also
includes
that
for
renewals
of
licenses,
it
then
also
expressly
provides
that
the--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes,
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
they
also
trade
with
indians.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
the
point--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--the
point--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
your
honor,
because
the
hotel
would
not
be
permitted
to
deny
customers
based
on
their
native
american
status.
that's
illegal.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
if
you
are
operating
a
business--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
that's
the
history
of
the
navajo...
of
the
indian
trader
statutes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
this
was
directed--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
think--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
think
then,
if
you
set
all
of
that
aside,
you
also
then
come
back
to
the
analysis
under
montana,
your
honor,
and
i
would
like
to
address
that.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
will
read
you
the
definition
of
reservation
business
which
explains
that
it
governs
businesses
on
reservations
that
deal
with
indians.
i
can
read
that
provision.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
your
honor.
that's--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--and
that's
the
overall
scheme--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--this
is
to
regulate--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--we
believe
that
the
navajo
business
reservation
regulations
at
25
c.f.r.
141
include
several
provisions
that
anticipate
that.
there
are
requirements
concerning
pricing
of
goods,
a
bond
that
is
required--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--for
example,
there
is
a
bond
requirement
that
every
trader
must
post,
and
any--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--and
any
customer
that
would
recover
is
entitled
to
go
against
that
bond
for
the
recovery
of
their
judgment.
it
spans...
it
applies
beyond
simply
indian
customers.
many
of
the
regulations
do.
