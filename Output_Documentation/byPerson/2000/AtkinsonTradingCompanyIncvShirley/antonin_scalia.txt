justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
it
didn't
deal
with
members
of
the
tribe.
it
could
still
run
the
hotel
without...
without
getting
any
federal
license?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
it...
you're
not
sure
that's
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
had
an
option,
didn't
you,
to
get
compensated
for
it,
or
to
trade
for
land
outside
the
reservation?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
wouldn't
compensate
you
for
what
was
already
built?
you
don't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
buster
wasn't
one
of
our
cases,
anyway.
it
was
a
ninth
circuit
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
eighth
circuit?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
the
tribe
not
provide
the
services?
could
the
tribe
say,
look,
we're
not
going
to
send
our
fire
engines
unless...
unless
you
agree
to
pay
for
them
just
as
you
agreed
to
pay
for
the
ambulance
service.
i
know
that
sometimes
there
are
two
counties,
one
of
which
doesn't...
isn't
large
enough
or
populace
enough
to
have
a
fire
department,
and
in
my
experience
very
often
the
neighboring
county
will
send
their
fire
engines
but
charge
the
homeowner
whom
they've
serviced
in
that
fashion.
could
the
tribe
do
that
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're
not
going
to
win
very
much
if
that's
what
we
hold...
the
tribe
will
just
go
back
and
impose
the
tax
on
the
hotel.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
really
want
us
to
address
that
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
tribe
impose
taxes
on
nontribal
members
residing
on
fee
land
within
the
reservation?
i
mean,
other
kinds
of
taxes?
income
taxes,
real
estate
taxes?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
real
estate
tax?
do
they
have
a
real
estate
tax?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
sounds
pretty
good...
where
is
this
reservation?
justice
antonin
scalia
assuming
that
the
hotel
rather
than
the
guests
are
the
object
of
the
tax...
why
isn't
the
acceptance
of
fire
service...
i
think
it's
conceded
that
on
at
least
one
occasion
the
tribal
fire
brigade
did
come
to
assist
the
hotel.
why
isn't
the
acceptance
of
that
assistance
a
consensual
relationship?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
not
as
unfair
as
one
might
think.
the
tribe
receives
a
considerable
amount
of
assistance
from
the
federal
government,
and
some
from
the
state
government,
and
these
visitors
pay
federal
taxes
and
they
pay
state
taxes.
maybe
one
of
the
incidental
benefits
of
that
is
that
when
they
happen
to
be
on
fee
land
on
a
tribal
reservation,
they
may
get
the
incidental
benefit
of
some
of
the
tribal
services
that
these
federal
and
state
taxes
enable
to
be
provided.
i
don't
see
anything
terribly
unfair
about
that.
how
much
of
its...
of
its
income
is
attributable
to
the
federal
government?
it
was
in
one
of
the
briefs.
i
don't
remember
which
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
don't
consider
that
terribly
unfair.
i
mean,
these
people
are
paying
their
federal
taxes,
and
they're
paying
state
taxes.
many
of
them
are
perhaps
from
states
other
than
the
state
in
which
the
reservation
is,
but
i
don't
see
any
terrible
injustice
there
to
the
tribe.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
tribal
tax,
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
a
way...
in
a
way
that's
a
better
case
for
the
tribe.
i
mean,
gee,
you're
only
talking
about
one
percent
of
the
land
that
you
can't
tax...
one
percent
of
the
land
that
you
can't
impose
taxes
on,
at
least
when
the
land
is
controlled
by
non
indians.
why
wouldn't
it
be
the
case
that
we'd
be
more
likely
to
uphold
the
tribe's
ability
to
tax
under
the
second
of
the
montana
exceptions
where
much
of
the
reservation
is
in
fee?
there
you
would
say
that
the
tribe
needs
the
money
a
lot
more
from
the
fee
land.
i
don't...
you
know,
i
just
don't
see
which
way
it
cuts.
i'm
not
sure
of
the
fact
that
a
very
small
portion
of
the
land
on
this
reservation
is
fee
land,
that
it
helps
your
case
rather
than
hurts
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
is
like
a
statute
till
business...
it
just
couldn't
trade
with
the
indians.
isn't
that
right?
i
mean,
if
it
gave...
if
it
said,
you
know,
we
will
no
longer
buy
from
or
sell
to
indians,
but
we'll
continue
to
run
our
hotel,
it
wouldn't
have
to
get
the
federal
indian
trader
license,
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
understand
that,
but
suppose
they
had
no
tribal
members.
isn't
it
clear...
and
did
nothing
but
rent
hotel
rooms
to...
to
nontribal
guests.
would
they
have
to
have
an
indian
trader's
license?
justice
antonin
scalia
certainly
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
everybody
is
an
indian
trader.
everybody
needs
an
indian
trader,
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
you
say
you
need
a
license
to
run
a
hotel?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
read
the
statute...
the
statute
says
power
to
appoint
traders
with
indians.
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
shall
have
the
sole
power
and
authority
to
appoint
traders
to
the
indian
tribes
and
to
make
such
rules
and
regulations
as
he
may
deem
just
and
proper,
specifying
the
kind
and
quantity
of
goods
and
the
prices
at
which
such
goods
shall
be
sold
to
the
indians.
i
don't
see
how
in
the
world
this
has
any
application
to
a
hotel
owner
who
has
a
hotel
that
serves
visitors
from
off
the
reservation.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
he's
an
indian
trader,
but
justice
souter's
question
is,
do
you
become
an
indian
trader
by
running
a
hotel
on
fee
land
by
non
indians
for
non
indians.
that's
the
question.
does
that
make
them
an
indian
trader?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
be
an
indian
trader.
everybody
has
to
be
an
indian
trader,
so
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--my,
my.
you
can't
go
on
fee
land...
your
own
land...
and
open
any
business
there
without
becoming
an
indian
trader.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
remarkable.
