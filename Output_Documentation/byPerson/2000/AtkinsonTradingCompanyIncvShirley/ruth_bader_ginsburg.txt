justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
it
have
to
do
with
being
within
the
borders
of
the
reservation,
because
even
though
it's
fee
land,
it
is
inside
the
reservation
boundaries.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
don't
know
for
sure
whether
an
indian
trader's
license
would
be
necessary
for
the
hotel,
even
if
it
were
serving
guests
from
outside
the
tribe.
you're
not
certain
about
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
on
this
hotel...
is
it
subject
to
an
arizona
room
tax?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
what...
what
would
that
amount
to?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
this
would
be
three...
three
room
taxes
essentially,
then.
are
there
other
hotels
on
this
reservation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
they
also
on
fee
land,
or
are
they
on
tribal
land?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
would
be...
that
would
be
true,
too,
if
this
hotel
were
on
tribal
land
itself.
and
is
that
the
distinction
you're
making...
that
this
happens
to
be
on
fee
land?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
it
be
different?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
they
still
can't
vote,
and
most
of
their
guests
are
not
members
of
the
tribe.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
state
tax
works
the
same
way,
doesn't
it?
the
tax...
the
incidence
is
on
the
guests,
but
the
hotel
pays
it
to
the
state.
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
any
different
from
what
went
on
in
strate
where
it
was
a
federal
highway?
and
there
were
tribal
police
as
well
as
state
police,
i
think,
involved.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
follow
that
distinction,
as
i
would
think
that
the
more
basic
power
is
the
power
to
tax.
and
if
you
have
the
power
to
tax,
then
you
have
jurisdiction
to
enforce
that
tax.
is
it...
mr.
cole
told
us
that
he
doesn't...
he
thinks
that
jurisdiction
to
tax
and
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
go
together.
you
seem
to
think
that
jurisdiction
to
tax
requires
less
than
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
incidence
would
be
the
same.
it's
the
same
tax.
can
you
tell
us
for
sure...
you
said
there
were
nineteen
hotels,
four
of
them
on
fee
land.
you
say
they're
all
equally
subject
to
the
tax.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
this
the
only
one
that
has
protested?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
as
far
as
you
know,
the
hotels
that
are
owned
by
tribal
members
on
tribal
land...
trust
land...
are
paying
the
arizona
and
the
county
tax
as
well.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gomez,
may
i...
may
i
ask
about
the
weight
you
put
on
the
indian
trader
status
that
this
hotel
has
had?
you
did
say
something
about
that
in
your
brief,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
would
be
highly
relevant
if
we
were
talking
about
a
buyer
seller
relationship
between
the
trader
and
the
tribal
members.
but
in
what
way
did
the
indian
trader
status
affect
the
hotel
guest
relationship?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
tax,
but
do
you
expect
to
pay
three?
