justice
david
h.
souter
it
seems
to
be
a...
no,
please--
justice
david
h.
souter
you
said
that
if
the
building
were
on
tribal
land,
that
there
would
be
a
relationship
with
the
tribe
by
virtue
of
that.
what
would
that
relationship
consist
of?
what
would
its
practical
consequences
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
jicarilla
merrion
case...
how
do
you
fit
that
into
this
analysis?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
cole...
no,
i
was
being...
mr.
cole,
you
spoke
a
moment
ago
the
fact
that
we
had
referred
to
the
possibility
of
a
taxation
exception
as
part
of
the
first
montana
exception
essentially
arising
from
consensual
relationships.
it
strikes
me
that
it's
certainly
possible
that
a
taxation
exception
might
arise
under
the
second
montana
category,
and
that
brings
me
back
to
something
that
has
already
come
up,
but
i
just
want
to
get
clear
on
your
position
on
it.
under
the
second
exception
in
effect
for
the
integrity
of
tribal
government,
i
think
there's
probably
a
pretty
fair
argument
that
if
the
tribe
is,
in
fact,
providing
services,
then
the
tribe
ought
to
be
able
to
tax
to
pay
for,
in
effect,
a
proportionate
share
of
the
costs
that
those
services
cost
the
tribe.
i
realize
that
there's
a
factual
dispute
in
this
case...
i
realize
from
the
briefs...
about
the
extent
of
the
services
that
the
tribe
is
providing.
my
question
is,
do
you
take
the
position
that
your
client
gets
no
services
whatsoever,
or
no
benefit
of
municipal
services
whatsoever
from
the
tribe?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
fact
that
there
is
generally
law
and
order
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
now--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
about
fire
protection?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
same
thing
is
true,
it
seems
to
me,
in
many
state
relationships
in
which
there
is
a
state
police
force,
there's
a
county
police
force,
there's
a
local
police
force,
and
a
given
property
tax
owner
is
paying
taxes
through
various
taxing
mechanisms
for
all
three.
so
the
fact
that
there
may
be
another
source...
and
maybe
even
a
principal
source...
of
police,
fire,
or
whatnot
protection
available
i
don't
think
necessarily
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
you
shouldn't
have
to
pay,
as
it
were,
the
portion
of
some...
for
the
same
services
by
an
overlapping
jurisdiction.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
true,
but
the
assumption
of
the
question
is
that
the
indian
sovereignty
is
sufficient
to
give
it
authority
to
provide
fire
services,
police
services,
and
so
on.
so
i
think...
i
think
this
argument
assumes
that
we
are
within
an
area
of
sovereignty.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
your
client
paying
property
taxes
and
income
taxes?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
can
you
quote
from
them
an
expressed
statement
to
the
effect
that
the
government
is
purporting
to
require
the
license
not
merely
to
trade
in
the
terms
that
justice
scalia
quoted
a
moment
ago,
but
to
provide
non
indian
services.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
and
then--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
and
how
could...
but
what
we're
trying
to
get
at
is
how
do
we
make
the
leap
from
that
to
the
provision
of
hotel
services
by
a
non
indian
to
a
non
indian
on
fee
land,
and
my
question
is,
does
the
regulations...
or
does
a
regulation
you
have
been
alluding
to
expressly
say
yes,
trade
with
the
indians
is
broad
enough
to
include
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
can
you...
can
you
quote?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
before
you
do,
please,
is
there...
i
just
want
to
know
whether
the
secretary
has
gone
so
far
as
to
say
in
so
many
words
that
the
provision
of
these
kinds
of
hotel
services
that
we
keep
describing
over
and
over
again
requires
the
indian
trader
license.
is
there...
is
there
a
phrase
in
a
regulation
to
that
effect?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
your
best
shot?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
what's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
but
i
don't
want...
you
talk
about
overall
schemes.
the
only
thing
that
i've
heard
quoted
is,
in
fact,
a
series
of
statements
that
refer
to
trading
in
goods
with
indians.
we're
not
dealing
with
that
here,
and
the
overall
scheme
doesn't
get
me
any
further
from
trading
with
goods
with
indians.
what
i
want
to
know
is,
has
the
secretary
gone
so
far
as
to
purport,
as
to
claim,
that
this
overall
scheme
does
in
fact
include
the
provision
of
these
non
indian
hotel
services.
so
what's
the
best
shot
at
the
secretary's
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
goods,
goods.
how
about
hotel
services?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
every
trader
must
post.
