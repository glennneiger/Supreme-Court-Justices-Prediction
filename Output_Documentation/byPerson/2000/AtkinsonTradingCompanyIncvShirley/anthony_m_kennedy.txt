justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
the
buster
case
out
of
the...
i
think
the
eighth
circuit...
figures
rather
largely
in
the
briefs
here.
that
was
a
tax
on
people
who
wanted
to
do
permit
fee...
for
people
who
wanted
to
do
business
within
the
reservation.
there
was
no
distinction
in
fee
land
and
non
fee
land
there,
was
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
the
state
has
an
interest
in
making
sure
that
owners
of
fee
land
are
treated
fairly
and
equitably.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
state
of
arizona,
and
all
of
the
arizona
citizens
who
are
using
the
hotel...
that's
the
state's
interest.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
but
of
course
in
this
case
it's
as
if
the
buyer
had
to
have
a
license.
you
admit...
everybody
agrees
the
incidence
of
the
tax
is
on
the
guests--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i've
never
heard
of
an
indian
trader
statute...
maybe
i'm
wrong...
where
buyers
have
to
have
a
license?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
as
justice
scalia
said,
it
might
not...
it
may
be
formalistic,
but
at
least
in
this
case
the
incidence
is
on
the
guests.
everybody
agrees
with
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
they
haven't
consented
to
do
business
with
the
tribe.
