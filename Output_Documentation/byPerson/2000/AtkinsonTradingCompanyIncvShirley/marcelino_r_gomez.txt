mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
question
here
today
is
whether
the
navajo
government
can
impose
its
hotel
occupancy
tax
on
travelers
who
elect
to
travel
onto
the
navajo
reservation,
elect
to
spend
the
night
at
a
hotel,
and
receive
the
benefits
of
a
civilized
society
that's
assured
by
the
navajo
nation's
govern--
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
--we
think...
in
the
area
of
taxation,
we
think
it
is
sufficient.
the
reason
we
feel
that
way
is
the
navajo
police
patrol
these
highways.
they
patrol
the
cameron
trading
post
on
a
regular
basis.
in
joint
lodging
material,
page
178,
179,
the
navajo
police
patrol
the
cameron
trading
post
a
couple
of
times
a
day.
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
we
believe
that
there
is
a
distinction
here
between
the
cases
cited
by
the
petitioner,
montana,
and
in
strate.
in
strate
you
were
talking
about
adjudicatory
power
of
the
courts.
here,
you're
talking
about
taxation,
and
the
guests
who
come
on...
looking
at
the
reason
for
taxation,
taxation
is
utilized
to
share
the
burdens
of
the
costs
of
government.
and
it's
not
too
much
to
ask
these
travelers
to
contribute
a
small
share--
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
--i
think
in
certain
areas.
for
example,
in
the
strate
case,
that
involved
two
nonmembers.
here
you
have
the
government
of
the
reservation...
the
navajo
government...
on
a
reservation
boundary
that
has
been
drawn
by
congress,
engaging
in
services,
providing
essential
governmental
services
to
whomever--
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
--yes.
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
that
is
correct,
or
they
could
travel
on
the
state
highways
which
were
right
of
ways
granted--
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
--your
honor,
i
think
this
would...
i
think
this
tax
would
be
upheld
under
either
one
of
the
two
montana
exceptions.
the
first--
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
--we
feel
that
the
consensual
relationship
that
the
hotel
guests
have
with
the
navajo
tribe
would
be
that
they
travel
onto
the
navajo
reservation
and
they're
receiving
the
benefits
of
police
and
fire
protection.
whether
they
actually
need
it
or
not,
those
services
are
available.
and
hopefully
they
will
never
need
it.
i
think
when
any
of
us
travel--
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
--it
may
vary,
but
i
think
it
may
be
about
two
thirds.
i
think
something--
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
--i
think
the
distinction
here...
and
i
guess
i
am
taking
a
look
at
the
reason
for
taxation.
it's
to
spur
the
cost
of
government
so
everybody
shares--
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
--i
think
applying
the
strate
rule,
and
then
i
think
we
would
be
in
a
difficult
situation.
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
there
are
nineteen--
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
--okay.
there
are
nineteen
hotels
on
the
navajo
reservation,
four
of
which
are
on
fee
land.
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
i
think
with
respect
to
the
other
four
that
are
located
on
fee
land,
their
ownership
may
be
different
than
here,
and
that
one,
maybe
two,
are
owned
by
tribal
members.
one
hotel
is
not
owned
by
a
tribal
member.
the
others
may
have
agreements,
for
example,
for
water,
for
use
of
land,
for
landing...
for
air
landing
strips,
so
that
they
may
have
a
different
factual
situation
in
the
cameron
trading
post
as--
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
--all
of
the
hotels
on
the
navajo
reservation
pay
this
tax.
and
this
tax
is
paid
by
those
hotels
on
behalf
of
their
guests,
regardless
of
whether
they
are
members
or
nonmembers.
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
they...
the
hotels
that
are
located
on
trust
land?
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
it's
my
understanding
those
hotel...
those
guests
would
also
be
paying
the
state
and
county
taxes.
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
it's
my
understanding
that
the
nonmember
owned
hotels
on
trust
land
collect
the
arizona
and
county
taxes
that
are
imposed
on
the
hotel
guests
because
of--
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
--member
owned
hotels...
they
may
have...
it's
getting
complicated
here.
this
gets
into
a
situation
where
they...
it
would
depend
upon
where
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
falls.
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
if
it
falls
on
the
guest
and
then
member
owned
hotels
would
be
subject
to
collecting
that
tax
and
paying
it
over
to
the
state.
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
all
nineteen...
all
nineteen
pay
the
tax.
everybody
is
subject
to
the
tax.
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
this
is...
this
is
the
only
one
who
has
litigated...
there
is
one
other
hotel,
i
think,
that
has
filed
a...
an
appeal
and
they
asked
to
wait
until
the
outcome
of
this
case.
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
yes.
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
yes.
they're
paying
all...
all
the
taxes.
it's
our
understanding--
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
--it
would
be...
it
would
be
in
the
record.
nobody
testified
on
that
legal...
on
legal
tax
theories.
but
we
feel
that
this
case
is
a
lot
different
than
montana.
in
montana,
it
dealt
with
a...
a
regulation
that
applied
only
to
nonmembers
on
hunting
and
fishing.
here,
you
have
a
tax
that
applies
to
everybody,
irregardless
of
whether
they
are
members
or
not.
there's
no
distinction
here
as
to
your
liability
to
pay
your
tax
based
on
whether
you're
a
member
or
not.
the...
there's
no
state
interest
involved
here.
for
example,
in
montana
you
had
the
state
interest
involved
with
the
ownership
of
the
riverbed,
and
also
some
conflicting
hunting
and
fishing
regulations.
here,
in
fact,
the
arizona
department
of
revenue
and
the
office
of
the
navajo
tax
commission
both
have
entered
into
joint
enforcement
agreements
regarding
this
tax
and
other
taxes.
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
yes.
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
that's
correct.
and
as
i
pointed
out,
the
tribal
taxes
apply
to
everybody,
irregardless
of
who
you
are,
so
that
you
don't
get
any
benefit
by
being
a
member...
you
don't
avoid
paying
the
tax.
you're
still
responsible
for
paying
this
tax.
and
for
example,
some
of
the
other
taxes
that
are
paid
include
a
fuel
excise
tax,
business
activity
tax,
tobacco
products
tax,
oil
and
gas
severance
tax...
all
these
taxes
are
collected
by
the
navajo
nation
from
whomever
engages
in
that
type
of
activity,
irregardless
of
whether
they
are
members
or
not,
and
nonmembers.
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
you
know,
i
think
what
we're
asking
for
is
a
rule
that
applies
to
the
navajo
reservation,
and--
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
--you
know,
we
think
that
the
facts
here
were
more
than
ninety
nine
percent
of
the
land
is
held
in
trust
on
the
navajo
reservation.
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
facts
of
the
case--
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
--on
its
merits.
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
we
believe
that
in
taxation
what
the
navajo
government
has
tried
to
do
is
it's
tried
to
be
as
fair
as
possible
so
that
when
they
pass
a
tax,
everybody
that
engages
in
that
business
has
a
responsibility
of
paying
that
tax.
and
if
you
were
to
hold
that
just
because
it
was
less
than
one
percent
of
the
land
was
held
in
fee,
this
would
give
these
people
an
economic
advantage
over
all
the
other
people
who
did
pay
the
tax...
all
the
other
hotel
operators
who
operate
on
the
navajo
reservation.
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
the
only
case
that
i'm
aware
of
where
it
seemed
where
a
percentage
of
fee
land
was
the
brendale
closed
reservation
judgment
of
this
court,
where
i
think
ninety
seven
percent
of
the
land
was
held
in
trust
in
the
closed
reservation
in
brendale.
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
well,
it's
my
understanding
that
for
this
operation
to
even
engage
in
economic
activity
within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
the
navajo
reservation,
it
is
required
to
obtain
an
indian
trader's
license
under
the
indian
trader
statutes
and
regulations...
a
navajo
business
reservation
license...
and
that
it
cannot
engage
in
business
in
the
absence
of
acquiring
that
license.
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
it
is
my
reading
that
previously
this
hotel
operation
or
the
store...
in
fact,
it's
a
trading
company...
challenged
the
indian
trader...
the
applicability
of
the
indian
trader
regulations
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
a
previous
case,
ashcroft,
and
in
that
case
it
was
determined
that
they
were
required
to
obtain
an
indian
trader's
license
even
though
they
had
just
a
small
amount
of
sales
to
tribal
members.
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
well,
i--
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
--it
seems
like
the
regulations
may
require--
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
--within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
the
navajo
reservation,
i
think
that
would
be
true.
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
yes.
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
no.
and
i
think
it's
also
important
to
point
out
that
some
of
these
guests...
or
they
made
the
comment
that
people
pay
federal
taxes,
they
pay
state
taxes.
the
record
shows
that
many
of
these
guests
are...
are...
come
from
japan
and
europe,
so
they
would
not
pay
either
one
of
those
income
taxes.
they
are
travelers
who
travel
to
any
location.
for
example,
i
expect
to
be
paying
a
hotel
occupancy
tax
on
my
hotel
room
this
evening,
and
i
will
not
be--
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
--i'll
look
at
my
bill
this
evening,
but--
mr.
marcelino
r.
gomez
--i
think
that
this
case
is
different
than
montana
in
that
the
demographics
are
much
different.
we're
talking
about
a
tax
here
that's
utilized
to
fund
services
that
benefit
these
travelers
who
come
onto
the
navajo
reservation.
and
they
may
never
need
these
services,
but
these
services
are
there.
and
in
the
absence
of
funding
to
provide
these
services,
it
would
be
a
bad
situation
if
you
called
the
police
and
they
didn't
answer.
and
what
happens
here
is
the
911
call
may
go
down
to
flagstaff,
but
it's
immediately
routed
to
the
navajo
police
force
that
has
a
substation
in
cameron.
thank
you.
