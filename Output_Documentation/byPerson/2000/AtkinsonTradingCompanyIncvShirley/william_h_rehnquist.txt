chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
00-454,
the
atkinson
trading
company
v.
joe
shirley.
mr.
cole.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
precisely
is
the
incidence
of
the
tax,
mr.
cole?
who
was
the
tax
on?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
they...
what?
the
hotel
owner
simply
acts
as
a
collector?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
didn't
this
also
go
through
the
tribal
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--how
about...
how
about
water
and
electricity
and
that
sort
of
thing?
utilities?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
hotel
supplies
its
own--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
since
you
say
the
tax
is
on
the
guests
at
the
hotel,
and
the
hotel
merely
acts
as
a
conduit,
then
why
was
the...
why
did
the
tribal
court
say
that
the
hotel
owner
was
liable?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it's
statutory
in
the
sense
of
tribal
regulation,
or--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--is
it
tribal,
or
federal,
or
state?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
is
the
legal
question
here,
do
the
guests
have
a
relationship
with
the
tribe,
or
does
the
hotel
have
a
relationship
with
the
tribe.
which
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
cole.
mr.
gomez,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
you
say
they
elect
to
travel
onto
the
navajo
reservation.
your
opponent
says
that
they
can
travel
by
a
federal
or
state
highway
to
the
hotel,
that
they
will
be
technically
on
the
reservation.
but
do
you
think
that
that
is
sufficient?
if
they
never
leave
the
state
highway
except
to
go
on
fee
lands?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
don't
think
any
of
our
cases
dealing
with
this
issue
of,
you
know,
what
percentage
of
the
land
is
held
in
trust,
or
what
might
be
fee
land?
if
it
ever
made
that
sort
of
a
distinction.
can
you...
would
you
know
of
one
that
has?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
never
know.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gomez.
ms.
brinkmann,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
a
federal
regulation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
sort
of
regulations?
i
mean,
could
you
tell
us
more
about
the
secretary's
authority?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
where
is
that
in
the
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
where's
the
trade
with
the
indians
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
yes,
but
we're
not
bound
by
the
ashcroft
decision.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
is
the
statutory
section
again
that
authorizes
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
twenty
five
2...
and
2
through
9.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
brinkmann.
mr.
cole,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
williams
against
lee
has
held
that
it
did,
and
it--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cole.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
second
opinion
of
the
court
i
have
to
announce
is
no.
00-454,
atkinson
trading
company
against
shirley.
the
navajo
indian
tribe
imposes
an
8%
tax
upon
all
hotel
rooms
located
within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
its
reservation.
the
atkinson
trading
company
operates
such
a
hotel
near
cameron,
arizona,
just
south
of
the
little
colorado
river
on
the
road
from
flagstaff
up
to
the
grand
canyon.
the
trading
company
is
not
a
member
of
the
navajo
nation
and
owns
the
land
itself.
it
argues
that
the
navajo
tribe
lacks
the
authority
to
enforce
this
hotel
tax
against
non-members
residing
on
non-indian
land.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
rejected
this
argument.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
a
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse.
our
cases
in
this
area
have
established
that
with
limited
exceptions
indian
tribes
lack
civil
authority
over
non-members
on
non-indian
land
within
a
reservation.
we
hold
that
this
general
rule
applies
to
revenue
raising
taxes
imposed
by
tribes.
although,
we
have
upheld
an
indian
tribes
ability
to
tax
non
members
extracting
oil
and
gas
from
tribal
land.
indian
tribes
have
never
been
allowed
to
tax
non
members
conducting
business
on
their
own
land.
this
is
because
the
indian
tribes
are
dependent
sovereigns
and
therefore,
have
only
limited
civil
authority.
the
navajo
indian
tribe
however,
says
that
the
exceptions
to
this
general
rule
apply
here;
an
indian
tribe
may
assert
civil
jurisdiction
over
a
non-indian
land
where
the
non-members
entered
into
a
consensual
relationship
with
the
tribe
or
whether
non-members
conduct
threatens
the
political
integrity
of
the
tribe,
but
we
think
that
neither
exception
obtains
here.
first
although
the
trading
post
has
a
license
to
conduct
business
with
navajo
indians,
this
relationship
cannot
support
the
hotel
tax,
which
is
imposed
upon
the
trading
post’s
non
member
guests
who
reach
the
hotel
on
public
roads,
and
while
the
trading
post
benefits
from
the
availability
of
tribal
police,
fire
and
emergency
services,
this
is
not
sufficient
to
trigger
the
navajo
nation’s
civil
authority
otherwise
the
exception
would
simply
swallow
the
rule.
second
the
trading
post
operation
of
a
hotel
on
its
own
land
cannot
be
said
to
imperil
the
political
integrity
of
the
navajo
nation.
because
the
exceptions
do
not
apply
the
rule
of
the
indian
tribes
lacks
civil
authority
over
non-members
on
non-indian
land
controls
this
case,
the
hotel
tax
is
invalid.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
kennedy
and
thomas
joined.
