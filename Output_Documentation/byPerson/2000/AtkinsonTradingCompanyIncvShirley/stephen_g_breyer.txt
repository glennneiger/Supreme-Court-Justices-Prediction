justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--on
that
particular
thing,
it
seemed
to
me
quite
important,
and
i
seem
to
be
missing
a
fact.
if
there
is
no
other
hotel
on
fee
land,
then
your
position
is
stronger.
if
there
are
several,
then
i
guess
it's
the
fact
that
you
who
don't
have
a
connection
is
not
the
answer
because
maybe
everybody
in
your
category
has
a
lot
of
connections
with
the
tribe's
services
that
they
provide.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
my
question,
i
guess,
because
suppose
that
there
are
a
hundred
hotels,
ninety
nine
of
which
use
the
sewerage
systems,
the
water
systems,
the
police,
the
hospitals,
all
kinds
of
other
services
provided
by
the
tribe.
well,
that
might
be
a
basis
for
imposing
a
tax
on
hotels.
and
then
i
don't
know
that
one
could
get
out
of
it
by
the
happenstance
that
that
particular
hotel
doesn't
use
all
those
services,
only
uses
a
couple.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
whose
burden
is
it
to
provide
the
facts?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
is
it
different
from
strate
in
that
respect?
presumably
good
police
and
fire
protection
was
there
for
automobiles
as
well
in
strate.
what's
the
difference
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
no.
i
mean,
you
were
saying,
in
other
words,
in
your
opinion
if
taxes
are
the
same
as
tribal
court
jurisdiction,
if
the
rule
of
power
is
the
same,
then
you'd
lose.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
then
my
next
question
would
be,
is
there
any
hotel
to
which
this
applies
other
than
this
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
on
fee
land.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
if
four
of
them
are
on
fee
land,
do
we
have
any
information
that
although
this
hotel
doesn't
use
a
lot
of
tribal
resources,
in
fact
none
except
the
theoretical
possibility
of
police
and
fire,
maybe
those
other
four
hotels
do.
do
we
know
anything
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand...
i
thought
they
didn't
trade
with
the
reservation.
i
thought
that
they
had
a
license
that
they
never
use.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
percent
of
their
revenue
comes
from
trade
on
the
reservation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
less
than
one
percent,
so
it
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
you're
saying--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
other
words,
if
a
person
opens
up
a
huge
shopping
mall
and
he
happens
to
have...
he
sells
one
yo
yo
to
somebody
on
a
reservation,
that
then
the
reservation
could
impose
any
tax
they
want?
or
tax
the
whole
operation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
in
other
words,
everybody
i
think...
at
least
my
question...
imagine
this
hotel
just
where
it
is,
no
indian
has
ever
come
anywhere
near
it.
all
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
only
for
tourists--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--knowing
now,
do
you...
it
is,
however,
on
fee
land
on
the
reservation.
is
there
anything
in
the
regulations
you
have
in
front
of
you
that
says
to
run
a
hotel
like
that
you
need
a
license?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
assume
you
just
didn't
have
the
license.
what
would
happen?
he
just
doesn't
have
it.
he
says,
here
i
am,
i'm
opening
a
hotel,
and
i
don't
have
a
license.
then
what
happens?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
by
the
way,
the
only
people
who
ever
come
are
people
who
are
not
indians.
