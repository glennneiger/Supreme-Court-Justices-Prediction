mr.
charles
g.
cole
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
an
indian
tribe
may
tax
a
transaction
between
nonmembers
on
fee
land
within
the
reservation.
this
court
has
already
held
that
nonmembers
who
are
involved
in
an
auto
accident
on
the
equivalent
of
fee
land
are
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
tribal
courts
absent
consent.
a
transaction
between
nonmembers
on
fee
land
is
similarly
outside
the
tribe's
jurisdiction
because
it
does
not
involve
a
consensual
relationship
with
the
tribe
and
does
not
threaten
tribal
self
government.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
the
incidence
of
the
tax
is
on
the
guests
of
the
hotel.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
yes.
the
hotel
owner
acts
as
a
collector.
if
it
fails
to
collect,
however,
the
hotel
owner
would
be
held
liable
for
the
tax.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
we
believe
there
would
still
be
no
basis
for
the
taxation
on
these
facts.
it's
still
a
transaction
between
nonmembers
on
fee
land.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
the
hotel
must
have
a
license
from
the
federal
government
in
order
to
trade
with
the
members
of
the
tribe.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
it
needs
that
license
to
deal
with
members
of
the
tribe,
but
in
dealing
with
nonmembers
of
the
tribe,
the
federal
regulatory
scheme
is
not
applicable.
this
court's
tax
cases
illustrate
that
point,
because
there
is
no
preemptive
effect
in
dealing
with
nonmembers.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
yes,
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
well,
i...
that's
the
way
i
read
the
regulations,
yes.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
no.
if
all
the
hotel
were
doing,
the
act
of
serving
nonmembers
of
the
tribe
on
fee
land,
it
would
not
need
a
license
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
was
within
the
reservation.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
yes,
it
is.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
five
point
five
percent
from
the
state,
as
i
understand
the
state
law.
and
i
understand
there
is
also...
this
isn't
in
the
record...
a
local
county
tax
that
would
be
in
the
neighborhood
of
point
eight
eight
percent.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
yes,
there
are,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
the
record
doesn't
reflect
the
kind
of
land
that
they're
on,
and
i
don't
know
all
those
facts.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
well,
i
don't
think
this
is
decided,
your
honor,
on
a
generic
basis
across
all
the
hotels.
the
question
is
whether
this
landowner
and
these
guests
have
in
some
way
submitted
themselves
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribe.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
well,
we
don't
have
those
facts
in
the
record
at
all,
and
i
think
that
the
law
is
still
that
the
individual
nonmembers'
rights
not
to
be
governed
by
the
tribe
would
be
respected.
it's
not
an
equal
protection
question.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
well,
it's
the
tribe
that's
asserting
jurisdiction
in
this
instance,
and
we
have
provided
the
facts
to
show
that
there
are
no...
there's
no
consensual
relationship
that
we
have
with
the
tribe,
and
we
are
not
on
tribal
lands.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
yes,
it
did.
this
establishment
that
we're
talking
about
originally
sat
outside
the
reservation.
in
1934,
an
act
of
congress
redefined
the
borders
of
the
reservation
with
the
result
that
this
land
was
included
within
it.
the
act
specifically
preserved
the
valid
rights
of
the
landowner.
well,
this--
mr.
charles
g.
cole
--yes,
that's
true.
but
at
that
point,
something
had
already
been
built
on
the
land,
and
this
land
was
located
right
there
on
a
federal
highway.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
well,
the
history
here
is
unusual.
the
case
is
representative
insofar
as
the
presence
of
indians...
non
indians
on
fee
land
within
the
reservation
was
the
result
of
a
federal
statute.
as
a
result
of
other
federal
statutes,
there
are
non
indians
on
fee
land
in
other
reservations
around
the
united
states.
while
they
may
live
and
work
there,
they
typically
have
no
right
to
participate
in
tribal
government.
they
can't
vote
in
tribal
elections
or
serve
in
elected
roles
in
tribal
government--
mr.
charles
g.
cole
--yes.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
yes,
it
does
make
it
different
because
in
building
on
tribal
land
they
create
a
relationship
with
the
tribe.
they
are
on
the
land
that
the
tribe
controls,
and
it's
a
different
situation.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
right.
but
the
point
that
i
wanted
to
make,
your
honor,
is
that
because
of
this
relationship
with
people
who
can't
vote,
it's
a
sensitive
issue.
and
this
court
has
developed
some
general
rules
that
deal
with
the
relationship
between
the
nonmembers
and
the
tribe,
and
those
rules
brought
a
distinction
between
fee
land
and
tribal
lands
as
a
way
of
setting
to
each
group
what
its
rights
would
be.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
there
are
really
two
relationships.
as
a
practical
matter,
you
would
ordinarily
have
some
kind
of
a
lease
or
contractual
document
between
the
tribe
and
the
landowner,
and
the
very
fact
of
being
on
tribal
land
means
that
the
tribe
would
have
power
over
the
nonmember
in
that
situation.
this
court's
decision
in
montana,
as
i
was
saying,
supplied
a
general
clear
understandable
rule
for
nonmembers
on
the
reservation.
in
montana,
this
court
reasoned
that
members
of
the
tribe
had
inherent
power
to
govern
themselves
but
could
govern
nonmembers
only
in
exceptional
circumstances.
those
exceptions
were
grounded
in
the
rationale
of
the
main
rule.
if
nonmembers
enter
tribal
lands,
as
i've
mentioned,
they
subjected
themselves
to
the
tribe's
power
to
govern
its
own
lands.
if
they
entered
into
a
consensual
relationship
with
the
tribe
or
its
members,
they
subjected
those
relationships
to
the
tribe's
power
of
self
government.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
your
honor,
the
origins
of
that
case,
i
think,
have
been
a
little
obscure
with
time,
but
here
is
the
background
there.
that
case
dealt
with
what
were
then
called
the
five
civilized
tribes.
there
were
a
number
of
attorney
general
opinions
and
judicial
opinions
that
said
that
those
tribes
had
the
power
to
exclude
non
indian
intruders
from
their
lands
and
therefore
had
the
power
to
impose
a
licensing
fee
upon
them
if
they
decided
to
do
business
within
those
lands.
at
the
turn
of
the
century,
the
last
century
i'm
talking
about
that
ended
in
the
late
1800s...
as
congress
began
to
open
up
those
lands,
it
gave
the
settlers
the
right
to
remain
on
their
lands
and
essentially
not
be
excluded.
but
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
specific
statutory
and
presidential
and
treaty
framework
that
dealt
with
the
problem
of
the
licensing
fees.
there
was
an
act
called
the
curtis
act
which
said
that
any
ordnance,
including
this
ordnance
that
was
adopted
by
the
tribe,
would
have
to
be
approved
by
the
president,
wasn't
valid
until
it
was.
and
then
there
was
a
treaty
that
followed
when
they
opened
up
the
land
and
said
there
wouldn't
be
removal
that
eliminated
certain
licensing
fees
and
did
not
eliminate
others.
in
morris
v.
hitchcock,
this
court
looked
at
that
situation,
and
what
it
said
is
that
we
can
see
from
the
surrounding
laws
and
treaties
an
intent
to
preserve
that
original
power
to
charge
the
license
fee
for
these
tribes.
and
it
said
that
quite
clearly
in
morris
v.
hitchcock,
and
that
theme
is
then
picked
up
in
buster,
which
is,
yes,
originally
there
was
some
inherent
power
here
coming
from
the
ownership
dominion
over
the
land
to
charge
a
license
fee
as
a
condition.
and
we
can
see
that
in
this
case,
congress
by
what
it
did,
the
president
by
what
he
did,
and
the
treaties
by
what
they
did,
intended
to
carry
that
forward
and,
therefore,
the
license
fee
is
still
valid
even
as
to
settlers
who
can't
be
removed.
so
that's,
i
think,
the
best
explanation.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
no,
it
wasn't--
mr.
charles
g.
cole
--eighth
circuit
case,
your
honor.
i
spoke
in
general
terms
of
the
montana
rule.
respondents
seem
to
suggest
that
a
different
rule
might
apply
to
taxation.
there
is
no
basis
for
that
distinction.
the
central
question
is
still
the
same...
whether
the
tribe
is
governing
itself
or
not...
and
the
exceptions
have
to
be
the
same.
thus
in
strate,
this
court
said
that
the
montana
rule
would
apply
broadly
to
forms
of
civil
jurisdiction.
and
in
montana
itself,
this
court
referred
to
taxation
as
one
form
of
regulation
that
might
be
permissible
where
a
consensual
relationship
was
sought...
shown.
a
consistent
rule
for
all
forms
of
tribal
jurisdiction,
including
taxation,
is
important
from
the
perspective
of
the
nonmembers
who
invest
in
homes
and
businesses
on
fee
land
within
the
reservation.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
g.
cole
well
merrion
was
a
case
about,
as
you
said,
the
lease
with
the
tribe,
i
guess,
for
drilling
on
tribal
trust
lands...
that
entire
reservation
was
tribal
trust
lands,
and
the
court
said--
mr.
charles
g.
cole
--but
that...
but
the
lease
was
with
the
tribe,
so
they
directly
entered
into
a
consensual
relation--
mr.
charles
g.
cole
--well,
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
there
was
a
difference
of
views
in
that
case.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
the
majority's
holding
was
simply
that
in
signing
that
lease,
the
tribe
did
not
give
up
its
power
over...
dominion
over
its
own
trust
land.
it
said
at
one
point
in
the
opinion
that
there
was
no
tribal
authority
until
the
nonmember
entered
tribal
lands
or
engaged
in
business
with
the
tribe.
so
even
that
case,
on
its
own
terms,
essentially
excluded
a
situation
where
someone
was
not
on
tribal
trust
lands.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
i
would
say
that
the
benefits
are
incidental,
your
honor,
that
the
services
are
focused
on
the
navajo
population
in
this
part
of
the
reservation,
and
there
can
be
incidental
benefits
from
that.
but
that--
mr.
charles
g.
cole
--exactly.
but
that
shouldn't
be
a
basis
for
taxation.
in
the
first
place,
we
can
draw
a
distinction
between
those
situations
in
which
the
nonmember
on
fee
land
requests
the
service
from
the
tribe...
for
example,
ambulance
service.
and
the
record
reflects
here
that
when
ambulance
service
for
a
nonmember
is
requested,
the
tribe
charges
for
that.
and
that
would
be
a
consensual
relationship
and
a
voluntary
request,
and
that
could
be
charged
for.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
well,
in
the...
in
this
case,
there's
no
such
request
being
made,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
it
takes
the
water
on
its
own
land
from
the
river
and
returns
it
to
the
river,
so
it
does
not
receive
water
from
the
tribe.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
well,
there
is
a
dispute
in
the
record
about
that.
there
was
only
one
fire,
it
was
on
an
employee
housing
unit,
and
ultimately
fire
engines
came...
both
from
the
state
and
from
a
tribal
source.
i
think
that
the
answer
is
that
when
you
have
people
living
side
by
side,
you
have
a
community
of
tribal
members
and
you
have
nonmembers
as
well,
the
nonmembers
are
paying
state
taxes,
sales
taxes...
they're
paying
property
taxes,
they're
paying
income
taxes...
for
the
benefits
of
a
civilized
society.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
well,
each
one
of
those
would
be
a
full
sovereign
in
its
own
right,
and
would
be
an
entity
in
which
these
citizens
could
participate--
mr.
charles
g.
cole
--well,
certainly
the
tribe
can
provide
the
services,
but
the
nonmembers
cannot
participate
in
tribal
government.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
yes.
i
think
the
tribe
probably
could
do
that
here.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
there
is
a
specific
statutory
provision
which
says
that
if
the
taxes
are
assessed
against
the
guests,
that
the
hotel
must
pay.
i'm
not
sure
if
that's
your
question.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
there...
it
appears,
i
think,
on
page
105(a)
of
the
petition
appendix,
if
i
recall
correctly.
it
said--
mr.
charles
g.
cole
--it
is
tribal.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
yes.
well,
i
think
that's
right,
yes.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
well,
i
think
that
the
central
question
is,
do
the
guests
have
the
relationship,
because
the
incidence
of
the
tax
as
your
honor
pointed
out
at
the
outset
falls
on
the
guests.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
and
i...
and
i--
mr.
charles
g.
cole
--i
think
that
the
arguments
that
have
been
made
by
the
other
side
may
require
this
court
to
address
it,
because
they
have
tried
to
reach
the
guests
through
the
activities
of
the
hotel,
and
i
think
the
rationale
for
why
the
guests
are
not
taxable
is
that
a
transaction
between
nonmembers
on
fee
land
is
not
one
over
which
the
tribe
has
jurisdiction.
and
that
also
will
reach
the
hotel
at
the
same
time.
and
i
think
that
if
we
permit
taxation
of
the
hotel
based
on
incidental
services,
we
open
the
box
to
any
kind
of
tax
on
all
nonmembers,
because
all
of
them,
or
anyone
who's
on
the
reservation,
benefits
in
the
same
indirect
way
from
law
enforcement,
and--
mr.
charles
g.
cole
--no.
this
tribe
doesn't
have
that
power.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
because
these
are
roads
that
are...
this
is
a...
it's
right
on
a
state
highway,
at
least
as
for
this
hotel.
it's
on
a
federal
highway,
and
there's
a
crossing
state
highway.
there
are
many
other
federal
and
state
highways
that
run
through
the
reservation.
there
are
national
parks
within
this
reservation.
the
reservation
is
open,
and
i
think
under
the
principles
of
strate
it
couldn't
be
closed
at
this
point.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
no,
it
does
not
impose...
it
doesn't
impose
some
of
those
taxes
on
anybody
within
the
reservation.
it
doesn't
tax
its
own
members
with
an
income
tax,
at
least
as
of
the
time
that
this
record
was
created.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
no.
it
does
not
have
a
real
estate
tax.
it
does
have
a...
it
has
a
possessory
interest
tax--
mr.
charles
g.
cole
--well,
it's...
your
honor,
that's
a
point
that...
there
is
a
sphere
of
federal
protection
from
state
taxes
that
surrounds
the
reservation
so
that
the
members
are
not
being...
are
not
being
charged
state
income
taxes...
that's
the
mcclanahan
decision.
and
they
don't
have
state
property
taxes
to
pay
because
a
lot
of
this
is
tribal
lands,
and
in
transactions
among
themselves,
then,
they
don't
have
state
taxes.
they
also
don't
have,
according
to
this
record,
very
much
in
the
way
of
individual
taxes
imposed
on
individual
tribal
members.
the
navajo
tax
director
referred
to
that
and
said
that
they
are
not
paying
much
in
the
way
of
taxes.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
to
the
state?
yes.
yes,
it
is.
and
those
taxes
go
to
fund
the
school
in
cameron,
which
is
in
the
record...
the
public
school
elementary
school
is
being
paid
for
by
county
taxes.
coming
back
to
that,
the
central
problem
that,
justice
souter,
that
you
raised...
you
have
people
living
here,
members
and
nonmembers.
each
one
benefits
to
some
degree,
in
some
incidental
way,
from
the
services
provided
by
the
state
or
the
tribe.
but
the
problem
is
that
the
nonmembers
are
not
participating
at
all
in
tribal
government,
and
the
tribal
members
are
not
being
taxed
at
all
by
the
state.
so
in
this
circumstance,
the
rule
of
montana
makes
good
sense
that
unless
there's
a
consensual
relationship,
a
voluntary
transaction
as
we've
discussed,
or
an
entry
onto
tribal
lands,
that
they
wouldn't
be
taxed.
that
we're
not
going
to
permit
the
tribe,
essentially,
to
exercise
what
this
court
called
its
right
of
self
government
under
the
second
exception
as
a
means...
and
do
that
by
taxing
other
people
who
are
not
able
to
participate
in
tribal
government.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
there
is
some
ambiguity
about
how
that
was
requested.
in
other
words,
i'm
not
sure
it's
a
specific
request
to
the
tribe.
it's
rather
a
fire
alarm
goes
off,
and
it
goes
down
to
a
number...
a
911
number
that's
off
the
reservation,
and
the
tribal
company
then
got
sent.
but
if
it
were
an
acceptance...
if
it
were
an
acceptance
of
a
service,
a
voluntary
transaction,
it
would
be
limited
to
that
one
transaction.
it
would
not
provide
the
basis
for
a
generalized
tax
on
the
hotel.
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
g.
cole
i'd
like
to
put
this
discussion
of
the
indian
trader
statute
in
a
somewhat
broader
context.
in
every
one
of
the
cases
that
this
court's
decided,
montana,
bourland,
dealing
with
nonmembers,
brendale,
this...
and
strate.
this
court
has
repeated
that
if
congress
is
going
to...
if
there's
going
to
be
an
expansion
of
the
inherent
powers
of
the
tribes,
it
must
be
done
by
an
expressed
congressional
delegation.
and
if
we
apply
that
standard
to
this
whole
problem
with
the
indian
trader
statute,
it
becomes
relatively
easy.
to
the
extent
that
the
traders
are
trading
directly
with
indians,
then
perhaps
there
would
be
some
form
of
consensual
relationship
where
the
tribe
would
have
some
degree
of
power,
and
these
statutes
and
regulations
may
deal
with
it.
but
if
the
united
states--
mr.
charles
g.
cole
--well,
right,
but
the
united
states
is
arguing
that
these
statutes
in
this
regulatory
scheme
gives
the
tribes
additional
powers
over
nonmembers
on
fee
lands.
and
in
order
to
have
that,
there
has
to
be
an
expressed
congressional
delegation.
we
don't
have
that
here...
mostly
we've
had
a
discussion
of
regulations,
and
i
won't
go
into
the
clarity
of
those
regulations
but,
at
best,
they
are
regulations...
they
are
not
statutes.
and
the
statutes
themselves
don't
purport
to
give
the
tribes
additional
powers.
they
may
give
the
secretary
some
powers,
but
they
are
not
an
express
delegation
of
additional
powers
for
the
tribe.
so
on
that
basis
alone,
there
is
no
basis
for
saying
that
the
tribe
has
some
sort
of
privilege
here
it
can
grant
or
deny,
a
power
given
to
it
by
the
federal
government
that
it
can
use
to
extract
this
tax
on
transactions
between
non
indians
on
fee
land.
the
other
point
i
wanted
to
make
was
that
when
we
look
at
the
second
exception
and
whether
there
should
be
some
form
of
power
that
comes
from
the
incidental
impacts
of
these
tourists
on
the
reservation,
if
we
look
back
at
strate,
there
this
court
considered
what
was
the
standard,
and
it
was
in
effect
on
tribal
self
government.
this
court
looked
at
the
possibility
that
accidents
on
the
reservation
might
create
some
health
risks
and
certainly
would
call
on
some
tribal
services,
but
that
wasn't
enough
to
find
that
there
would
be
tribal
jurisdiction
in
those
circumstances.
here
we
have
these
guests
that
travel
on
the
highway
and
end
up
in
the
hotel
and,
in
effect,
there
is
less
of
a
showing
of
an
effect
on
the
tribe,
and
there
is
no
showing
of
an
effect
on
tribal
self
government.
this
is
a
difficult
area
when
we
look
at
the
possibility
of
a
tax
being
imposed
by
one
government
in
which
a
group
of
citizens
can't
participate,
and
we
have
a
well
established
set
of
rules
that
deals
with
that
in
montana
and
the
cases
that
have
followed
it.
this
case
should
be
decided
under
that
framework.
thank
you.
