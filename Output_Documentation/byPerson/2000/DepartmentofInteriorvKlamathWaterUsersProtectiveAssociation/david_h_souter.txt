justice
david

souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
when
the
department
of
the
interior
began
developing
a
plan
to
provide
water
allocations
among
competing
users,
the
department
asked
local
indian
tribes
to
consult
with
the
department
on
the
matter.
during
roughly
the
same
period,
the
department’s
bureau
of
indian
affairs
filed
claims
on
behalf
of
one
of
the
tribes
in
an
oregon
state
court
water
rights
adjudication.
the
respondent
klamath
water
users
protective
association,
the
group
whose
member’s
water
rights
interests
are
adverse
to
those
of
the
tribes,
filed
suit
under
the
freedom
on
information
act
to
compel
release
of
communications
between
the
tribes
and
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
the
bureau
sought
to
withhold
several
documents
as
privileged
and
therefore
covered
by
freedom
of
information
act
exemption
5,
which
exempts
from
disclosure
inter
or
intra-agency
memorandums
which
would
not
be
available
by
law
to
a
party
other
than
an
agency
in
litigating
with
the
agency.
the
district
court
granted
the
government
summary
judgment
and
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
in
a
unanimous
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
hold
that
the
documents
are
not
exempt
from
disclosure
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
there
are
two
conditions
we
are
qualifying
as
exempt
under
exemption
5:
first,
the
document
source
must
be
a
government
agency;
second,
it
must
fall
within
the
ambit
of
some
privilege
against
discovery
under
standards
that
would
govern
litigation
against
the
agency
that
holds
the
documents.
although
the
documents
in
this
case
may
satisfy
the
second
privilege
condition,
either
as
attorney
work-product
or
as
part
of
the
agency's
deliberative
process.
they
fail
to
satisfy
the
first
threshold
condition
of
being
inter
or
intra-agency.
we
have
recognized
that
some
courts
of
appeals
have
held
that
a
document
prepared
for
an
agency
by
a
non
governmental
consultant
may
none
the
less
qualify
as
an
intra-agency
memorandum,
where
the
submissions
by
outside
consultants
play
essentially
the
same
part
in
an
agency’s
deliberative
process
as
documents
prepared
by
agency
personnel,
and
where
they
do
not
reflect
particular
interest,
that
might
be
affected
by
the
proposed
government
action.
the
tribes
on
the
contrary
necessarily
communicate
with
the
department,
with
their
own
albeit
entirely
legitimate
interests
in
mind.
interests
that
are
in
competitions
with
those
of
other
seeking
benefits
that
are
inadequate
to
satisfy
everyone.
nor
is
it
enough
to
pull
these
documents
within
exemption
5
to
say
that
compelled
release
of
the
documents
would
impair
the
department’s
performance
of
its
fiduciary
obligations
to
the
tribes.
there
is
simply
no
support
for
reading
the
indian
trust
exemption
into
the
statute
which
we
read
strictly
to
serve
the
freedom
of
information
act
mandate
of
broad
disclosure.
