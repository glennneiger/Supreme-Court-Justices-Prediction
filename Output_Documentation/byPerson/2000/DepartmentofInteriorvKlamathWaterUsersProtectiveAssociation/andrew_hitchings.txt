mr.
andrew
hitchings
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
foia
exemption
5
does
not
apply
to
communications
between
the
government
and
outside
nonagency
parties
when
the
communications
concern
the
government's
allocation
of
a
valuable
right
or
benefit
among
these
nonagency
parties.
this
rule
does
not
change
due
to
the
existence
of
a
trustee-beneficiary
relationship
between
the
government
and
the
nonagency
party,
a
relationship
that
itself
does
not
give
rise
to
a
civil
discovery
privilege.
as
we
heard
in
the
discussion
preceding
this,
this
court's
decisions
and
congress
itself
have
consistently
recognized
that
the
dominant
purpose
of
foia
is
disclosure,
not
secrecy,
and
that
foia
exemptions
must
be
narrowly
construed.
mr.
andrew
hitchings
in
the
context
of
civil
litigation
there
is
not
a
recognized--
mr.
andrew
hitchings
--well,
the
consequence
should
be
looked
at
within
the
context
of--
mr.
andrew
hitchings
--the
consequence,
yes,
i
will
agree
with
that.
mr.
andrew
hitchings
well,
i
think
when
you
are
in
a
situation,
granted
the
indian
tribes
are
unique,
and
they've
been
recognized
that
way
throughout
history,
but
in
the
same
instance,
in
nevada
v.
u.s.,
this
court's
decision
in
that
case
did
recognize
the
unique
nature
that
the
government
has
to
deal
with,
competing
interests
within
water
rights
adjudications,
and
while
the
relationship
that
the
government
and
interior
may
have
with
project
water,
irrigation
water
users
may
not
approach
that
of
a
trustee,
certainly
nevada
said
that
the
government
is
obligated
to
undertake
substantial
obligations
on
their
behalf.
and
when
you're
talking
about
the
government
making
decisions
regarding
these
competing
interests,
and
it's
not
just
the
interests
of
the
irrigation
interests
and
of
the
tribes,
it's
also
competing
federal
interests
for
other
federally
reserved
water
rights,
one
thing
that--
mr.
andrew
hitchings
--well,
i
think
that
one
of
the
potential
off-ramps
to
that
is
that
there
may
be
other
foia
exemptions
that
would
apply
in
other
cases.
for
the
purposes
of
foia
exemption
5
our
position
is
that
it
does
not
where
you
have
the
government
allocating
a
valuable
privilege
amongst
competing
nonagency
parties.
mr.
andrew
hitchings
i
don't
know
if
that's
quite
the
moral
of
the
story,
but
it's...
certainly
the--
mr.
andrew
hitchings
--well,
i
think
one
of
the
other
points
regarding
your
honor's
question
was,
what
other
circumstances
may
apply.
i
think
in
many
circumstances
it
is
going
to
be
the
government
competing,
or
balancing,
or
allocating
amongst
a
number
of
competing
interests,
but
there
certainly
may
be
circumstances
where
indian
tribes
will
communicate
with
bia
or
interior,
and
the
government
is
not
in
this
position
where
they
actually
are
balancing--
mr.
andrew
hitchings
--i
think
the
rule
that
i
articulated
in
the
first
sentence
here
is
that
foia
exemption
5
does
not
apply
to
communications
between
the
government
and
outside
nonagency
parties
when
the
communications
concern
the
government's
allocation
of
a
valuable
benefit
or
privilege
amongst
those
interested
nonagency
parties.
mr.
andrew
hitchings
they
do,
and
they
have
their
own
attorneys
in
this
circumstance
too,
both
in
the
klamath
project
operations
plan
as
well
as
in
the
adjudication.
mr.
andrew
hitchings
well,
in
this
case
the
government
has
asserted
the
deliberative
process
privilege
protects
all
seven
documents
that
remain
in
dispute.
they
have
also
asserted
that
the
attorney
work
product
privilege
protects
two
of
those
seven,
and
that's
an
additional
basis
for
withholding
those
documents
within
the
rubric
of
foia
exemption
5,
and
those
two
documents
for
which
the
attorney-client
privilege
was
claimed...
i'm
sorry,
the
attorney
work
product
privilege
was
claimed,
one
of
them
specifically
discusses
the
klamath
project
operations
plan,
one
of
them
specifically
discusses
the
adjudication.
so
there
is
somewhat
of
a
mix
in
the
privileges
that
have
been
claimed
here,
but
it
is
true
that
the
primary
thrust
of
the
government's
argument
in
this
case
has
been
that
all
of
the
documents
are
protected
by
the
deliberative
process
privilege
within
foia
exemption
5.
mr.
andrew
hitchings
our
position
is
that
it
does
not,
and
it's
because
they
do
not...
for
the
same
reasons
that
it
does
not
work
within
the
deliberative
process
analysis
it
does
not
work
within
the
attorney
work
product
analysis
either.
they
do
not
have
a
common
goal,
a
common
defense
or
prosecution
against
a
common
adversary
here.
the
government
again,
interior
itself
has
many
obligations
and
many
competing
interests.
mr.
andrew
hitchings
correct
and,
in
fact,
as
far
as
the
klamath
project
operations
plan,
there
are
a
number
of
interests
that
the
tribes
are
adverse
to
the
government
on,
as
well
as
in
the
adjudication,
too,
and
the
adjudication
contests
were
filed
in
may
of
this
year,
where
the
tribes
themselves
have
filed
contests
to
claims
filed
on
behalf
of
the
fish
&
wildlife
service
for
wildlife
refuges
up
there.
that's
within
the
department
of
interior.
the
same
is
the
case
for
the
bureau
of
reclamation's
claims
that
have
been
filed.
the
same
is
the
case
for
the
klamath
project
operations
claim.
the
tribes
contest
the
manner
in
which
the
project
is
operated
if
the
government
is
operating
in
a
manner
to
benefit
project
irrigation
users,
perhaps
wildlife
refuges,
whatever
the
other
federal
interests
may
be
in
that
case.
one
of
the
points
that
was
brought
up
by
the
solicitor
general's
argument
was
this
alternative
test
of
what
the
role
of
the
document
might
play,
and
our
position
has
been
throughout
this
that
that
would
pretty
much
bring
within
the
purview
of
foia
exemption
5
any
document
that
is
submitted
to
the
government.
if
the
government
was
able
to
withhold
a
document
based
upon
its
affidavit
of
the
role
that
document
played
within
its
discussion,
that
would
include
just
about
anything,
and
it
would
provide
the
opportunity
for
federal
agencies
to
cloak
all
types
of
discussions
based
upon
that
type
of
assertion.
mr.
andrew
hitchings
that's
correct,
there
are
those
two
tests
to
that.
mr.
andrew
hitchings
correct.
you
would
need
to
satisfy
that
threshold
test
of
whether
it
is
inter
or
intraagency
and
then
meet
the
secondary
test,
which
is
whether
it
is
normally
privileged
within
the
civil
discovery
context.
mr.
andrew
hitchings
well,
i
understand
that,
the
worry
that
is
caused
by
that,
but
again,
i
think
there
may
be
other
circumstances
where
other
foia
exemptions
may
apply.
it
may
be
that
in
other
circumstances
that
foia
exemption
4
could
apply,
because
it's
a
commercial
privilege
that
is...
or
involves
commercial
information,
or
financial
information
that
is
otherwise
privileged
and
confidential.
in
fact,
amici
in
support
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
brought
that
very
point
up,
so
there
may
be
circumstances
where
the
government
could
assert
other
foia
privileges.
mr.
andrew
hitchings
that
would
be
within
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy,
perhaps,
or
one
of
the
other
exemptions--
mr.
andrew
hitchings
--correct.
there
are
other
examples,
and
it
is
the
discovery
privilege
that
have
been
historically
noted,
and
those
would
be
attorney-client,
attorney
work
product,
deliberative
process,
if
there
are
specific,
maybe
psycho...
psychiatrist-patient,
doctor-patient,
those
types
of
discovery
privileges,
but
in
this
case
there
is
no
recognized
trustee-beneficiary
privilege.
there
has
not
been
recognized
within...
there
has
not
been
one
recognized
within
the
civil
discovery
context,
and
foia
is
not
a
means
to
create
a
new
civil
discovery
privilege.
this
court's
decision
in
weber
aircraft
explicitly
stated
that,
and
that's
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
andrew
hitchings
our
position
is
that
the
government
simply
cannot
meet
that
threshold
intraagency
test
here,
because
you
have
a
circumstance
where
they
are
not
serving
as
a
neutral
outside,
objective
consultant.
they
are...
in
this
case
the
tribes
are
an
interested
party.
the
government
is
allocating
a
valuable
benefit
or
privilege
amongst
not
only
that
interested
party
but
many
others,
including
other
federal
interests,
and
our
position
is
that
test
just
simply
is
not
met
here
because
of
those
circumstances.
now,
granted,
there
are
circumstances
where
you
do
have
a
paid
outside
consultant
that
is
providing
information
to
the
agency
because
it
may
be
outside
of
that
agency's
expertise,
but
the
paid
consultant
has
no
direct
interest
in
the
decision
that
the
government
is
making
for
which
those
correspondence
are
provided,
and
that's
clearly
distinguishable
from
this
case.
mr.
andrew
hitchings
from
the
klamath
water
users,
members
themselves?
mr.
andrew
hitchings
i
don't
think
so.
we're
not
asking
for
that.
granted,
we
would
love
to
have
the
opportunity
to
have
secret
communications
with
interior
on
the
decisions
that
we're
making
here,
but
we
recognize
that
foia
exemption
5
just
is
not
read
that
broadly,
and
should
not
be
read
that
broadly,
and
i
think
in
justice
scalia's
dissent,
i
believe
that
was
in
the
julian
case,
he
specifically
stated
that
it
talks
about
a
consultant
in
a
governmentally
conferred
capacity,
and
that
seems
to
indicate
that
you're
talking
about
the
traditional
relationship
where
you
have
a
consultant
that's
paid
by
the
government
to
give
it
expert
advice.
mr.
andrew
hitchings
correct.
in
that
case--
mr.
andrew
hitchings
--right,
exactly.
in
that
case,
the...
whether
the
documents
were
intraagency
was
not
raised
below
and
was
not
part
of
the
majority's
opinion.
if
the
court
has
nothing
further,
that
would
conclude
my
statement.
