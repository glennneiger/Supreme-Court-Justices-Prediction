mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
application
of
exemption
5
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
to
seven
documents
that
pertain
to
the
federal
government's
exercise
of
its
responsibility
to
act
as
trustee
for
the
property
and
natural
resources
of
indian
tribes.
six
of
the
seven
documents
were
submitted
by
the
klamath
tribes
to
the
department
of
the
interior
at
the
government's
request.
the
seventh
document
was
prepared
by
a
doi
official
and
was
provided
to
attorneys
for
the
klamath
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
the
documents
relate
to
the
united
states'
representation
of
the
tribes'
interests
in
a
pending
general
oregon
stream
adjudication
as
well
as
to
the
bureau
of
reclamation's
management
of
the
klamath
reclamation
project
during
the
period
while
that
adjudication
remains
pending.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
at
the
time
that
the
documents
submitted,
the
department
of
interior
or
the
bureau
of
reclamation
more
specifically
was
attempting
to
prepare
a
long-term
operations
plan
for
the
klamath
project.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
has
not
been
abandoned.
the
long...
no
draft
long-term
plan
has
yet
been
issued,
but
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
is
still
under
preparation.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
is
still
ongoing
on
a
year-by-year
basis
the
bureau
of
reclamation,
or
bor,
manages
the
klamath
project
based
on
water
availability
during
the
course
of
that
year.
the
idea
behind
the
long-term
operations
plan,
sometimes
known
as
the
klamath
project
operations
plan,
or
kpop
colloquially,
was
to
devise
a
methodology
whereby
the
department
would
decide
in
advance
how
water
would
be
distributed
in
both
wet
and
dry
years,
whereas
current
practice
has
been
at
the
beginning
of
the
season
to
assess
the
likely
availability
of
water
and
make
a
determination
for
that
year.
the
preparation
of
the
kpop
in
a
sense
interacts
with
the
united
states'
representation
of
the
tribes
in
the
oregon
general
stream
adjudication,
because
it's
the
state
of
oregon
that
will
be
making
the
final
permanent
determination
as
to
who
has
what
water
rights
and
in
what
order
of
priority
and,
in
connection
with
that
adjudication,
the
united
states
has
filed
claims
on
behalf
of
the
tribes,
on
behalf
of
the
project,
as
well
as
on
behalf
of
other
federal
interests.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
are
not
technically
acting
as
their
attorney.
that
is,
the
tribes
have
their
own
attorneys,
but
the
united
states
acts
as
trustee.
it
has
filed
claims
in
the
oregon
adjudication--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
united
states
has
filed
claims
on
behalf
of
the
tribes.
with
regard
to
virtually
the
entirety
of
the
united
states
submission
the
tribes
have
filed
a
document
that
simply
says,
we
accept
and
incorporate
by
reference
the
claims
of
the
united
states.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
with
respect
to
a
small
fraction
of
the
case
the
tribes
have
filed
their
own
claim
that
differs
marginally
from
that
of
the
united
states
on
their
behalf,
but
i
think
there
is
nearly
a
100-percent
alignment
of
interests
in
the
oregon--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
the
united
states
has
also
filed
claims
on
behalf
of
the
project
and
on
behalf
of
other
federal
interests.
for
instance,
there
is
a
wildlife
refuge
in
the
area
for
which
the
united
states--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
we
would
certainly
say
that
to
the
extent
the
submissions
were
submitted...
to
the
extent
the
documents
were
submitted
to
the
united
states
in
its
capacity
as
trustee,
that
is,
with
regard
to
the
preparation
of
the
united
states'
claims
on
the
tribes'
behalf,
they
would
be
privileged
and
confidential.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
in
1976
there
was
a
legislative
proposal
that
would
have
created
a
new
foia
exemption
for
all
documents
in
the
possession
of
a
government
agency
pertaining
to
the
exercise
of
trust
responsibilities,
and
that
bill
was
never
acted
on.
that
bill
would
have
accomplished
an
exemption
from
the
foia
that
is
significantly
broader
than
the
exemption
we're
asking
for
here.
that
is,
the
applicability
of
that
exemption
would
not
have
turned
on
whether
the
documents
came
from
the
tribes
initially
and,
perhaps
more
important,
it
wouldn't
have
turned
on
whether
particular
documents
would
be
privileged
from
discovery
in
civil
litigation.
that
is,
the
focus
of
the
court
of
appeals'
concern...
perhaps
i
should
turn
to
page
2
of
our
brief,
which
sets
forth
the
language
of
exemption
5
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
exemption
5
states
that
the
requirement
of
compelled
disclosure
does
not
apply
to
matters
that
are,
quote,
interagency
or
intraagency
memorandums
or
letters
which
would
not
be
available
by
law
to
a
party
other
than
an
agency
in
litigation
with
the
agency,
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
certainly
doesn't
fit
within
the
most
common
conception
of
what
an
interagency
or
intraagency
memorandum
would
be.
the
courts
of
appeals
have,
over
the
past
30
years,
devised
a
methodology
for
determining
when
documents
that
were
created
by
persons
outside
the
government
may
nevertheless
be
regarded
as
sufficiently
internal
from
a
pragmatic
point
of
view
that
they
can
qualify
for
the
exemption.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
because
they
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
some
documents
submitted
by
outside
persons
play
a
role
in
the
agency's
deliberations
that
is
so
similar
to
the
role
that
a
staff
memorandum
would
play.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
they
haven't
referred
to
it
as
a
consultative
privilege,
but
they
have
certainly
said
that
they
have
used
outside
consultants
as
an
example
of
the
types--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--there
are
really
two
different
categories
of
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
and
one
is
as
you
suggest.
that
is,
there
are
situations
in
which
a
person
is
consulted
because
he
has
preexisting
expertise
but
no
particular
institutional
perspective
on
the
matter
at
issue,
and
there
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
basis
for
the
arrangement
is
that
this
person
is
serving
in
effect
as
a
temporary
employee,
performing
the
role
an
employee
would
perform.
there
are
other
cases
in
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no.
we
would
say
that
the
document
needs
to
be
submitted
to
the
government
in
its
capacity
as
trustee.
so,
for
example,
if
the
fish
&
wildlife
service
is
making
a
determination
as
to
whether
a
particular
species
should
be
listed
as
threatened
or
endangered
under
the
endangered
species
act
it's
possible
that
the
outcome
of
that
listing
decision
might
have
a
practical
effect
on
the
way
in
which
tribal
land
can
be
used.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
oh,
the
statute
refers
to
interagency
or
intraagency
memorandums
and
the
courts
of
appeals,
in
determining
what
can
be
properly
regarded
as
internal,
have
focused
on
the
existence
of
a
special
relationship
between
the
outside
person
and
the
government
official,
and
in
many
instances
the
outside
person,
as
i
say,
is
one
who
fulfills
the
role
of
an
agency
employee.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the
tribe
is
not
an
agency.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
is
not
covered
under
the
most
natural
reading
of
that
language.
i
think
there
is
a
sense
in
which
these
submissions
are
properly
characterized
as
interagency,
and
that
is
when
the
federal
government
actively
solicits
advice
and
assistance,
when
it
identifies
the
person
from
whom
advice
is
sought,
when
it
constructs
the
decision...
when
it
constructs
the
consultative
process
in
a
way
that
is
reasonably
designed
to
further
the
government's
own
interests,
the
resulting
document
can
be
said
to
be
internal
in
the
sense
that
the
circle
begins
and
ends
with
the
government.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
with
respect
to
the
existing
court
of
appeals
case
law,
certainly
the
consultant
temporary
employee
is
the
paradigmatic
example,
but
the
d.c.
circuit
has
also
applied
this
approach
in
cases
such
as
ryan
and
public
citizen
to
members
of
the
senate,
to
a
former
president
who
was
advising
the
archivist
regarding
the
proper
disposition
of
records
created
during
his
term
of
office,
where
the
idea
was
not
that
the
person
outside
the
government
was
stepping
into
the
shoes
of
an
agency
employee,
or
adopting
an
employee's
perspective.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
but
it
was
consulted
precisely
because
it
would
have
a
distinct
perspective
on
the
proper
manner
of
accomplishing
the
government's
objectives,
and
that's
really--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no,
because
the
united
states
does
not
act
as
a
trustee
for
the
water
users
association.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
the
trust
relationship
is
the
thing
that
brings
this
case
within
a
larger
principle.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
has
not
made
claims
on
behalf
of
the
water
association.
it
has
made
claims
on
behalf
of
the
project,
but
the
association
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--there
are
certainly
aspects
of
the
case
on
which
we
and
the
users
are
in
agreement.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
to
understand
why,
in
our
view,
it
is
evenhanded,
it's
essential
to
explain
that
there
are
several
component
agencies
within
the
department
of
the
interior,
but
two
that
are
particularly
important
here,
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
and
the
bureau
of
reclamation.
now,
both
the
tribes
and
the
water
users
corresponded
with
the
bureau
of
reclamation,
or
bor,
and
bor
received
a
foia
request
from
both
the
tribes
and
the
users
association
asking
for
the
documents
that
the
others
had
submitted,
and
for
better
or
for
worse
bor
turned
everything
over.
bor
was
absolutely
evenhanded
in
divulging
both
tribal
communications
and
the
water
users
association
communications.
it
may
be
that
under
our
theory
bor
should
not
have
been
quite
so
forthcoming,
but
it
was.
there
was
no
disuniformity
with
respect
to
bor.
bia
was
a
different
story.
bia
is
set
up
with
the
special
responsibility
of
exercising
the
government's
trust
responsibilities
to
the
indian
tribes.
it
essentially
corresponds
with
the
indian
tribes,
and
it
would
be
unusual
for
the
water
users
to
correspond
with
bia
at
all.
bia
was
the
subagency
within
the
department
of
the
interior
that
refused
to
disclose
some
of
these
documents,
with
one
exception
of
the
seven.
one
of
the
adjudication-related
documents
was
addressed
to
the
regional
solicitor
of
the
department
of
the
interior.
so
primarily
we
are
concerned
with
documents
that
were
submitted
to
a
subagency
within
doi
whose
particular
sphere
of
duty
and
expertise
is
the
exercise
of
trust
responsibilities
for
the
tribes,
and
this
court
in
nevada
v.
united
states
emphasized
the
bia's
unique
mission,
its
separate
juridical
status--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
i
guess
i
have
two
or
three
responses
to
that.
first,
you're
correct
that
the
bia
is
not
an
independent
agency.
it
is
a
subagency
of
doi,
and
therefore
is
ultimately
subject
to
doi
control.
at
the
same
time,
the
government
is
attempting
to
deal
in
a
pragmatic
fashion
with
the
sort
of
combination
of
responsibilities
that
no
private
party
would
ever
be
given.
that
is,
things
would
certainly
be
cleaner
from
our
point
of
view
of
doi
could
either
say,
we
will
treat
the
tribes
exactly
like
we
treat
everyone
else,
or
it
could
say,
we
will
treat
the
tribes
exactly
as
a
private
trustee
would
treat
the
beneficiary,
namely,
show
it
a
duty
of
undivided
loyalty.
it's
clear,
i
think
from
first
principles
and
from
this
court's
decision
in
nevada
v.
united
states,
that
the
department
can't
pursue
either
of
those
courses.
it
must
on
the
one
hand
fulfill
its
trust
responsibilities
but
on
the
other
hand
it
has
other
responsibilities
that
would
be
considered
conflicting
if
they
were
imposed
on
a
private
person,
so
giving
bia
primary
responsibility
for
the
carrying
out
of
the
department's
trust
mission
is
a
pragmatic
response
to
an
admittedly
messy
situation.
the
other
thing
i
would
say
is,
we
don't
contend
that
the
tribes
are
analogous
to
a
consultant
in
the
sense
of
stepping
into
the
shoes
of
an
agency
employee
or
doing
what
an
agency
employee
would
otherwise
do.
to
the
contrary,
we
think
the
input
from
the
tribes
is
essential
if
the
department
is
to
carry
out
its
trust
responsibilities,
but
that's
precisely
because
the
tribes
have
an
expertise
and
a
perspective
that
no
agency
employee
would
have.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
certainly--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
again
i
would
say,
for
better
or
for
worse,
the
bor
did
not
favor
the
tribes
vis-a-vis
the
water
users.
it
was
equally
responsive
to
both
foia
requests.
the
only--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--not
whatever
it
gets
from
the
tribes,
but
whatever
the
tribes
submit
to
it
in
its
capacity
as
trustee,
so
yes,
our
position
would
be,
if
the
tribes
approach
bor
and
say,
in
order
to
fulfill
the
united
states'
duties
as
trustee,
the
bor
must
take
the
following
management
steps.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
i
think
it's...
obviously,
one
of
the
arguments
advanced
in
favor
of
the
legislation
that
was
proposed
in
1976
was
that
the
legislation
would
clarify
the
ambiguity,
would
make
it
unnecessary
to
resolve
difficult
questions
concerning
the
application
of
existing
foia
exemptions,
but
i
think
the
court
has
long
taken
the
position
that
the
foia
should
be
implemented
in
a
practical
way,
that
it
should
be
implemented
in
a
way
that
doesn't
interfere
with
the
government's
performance
of
its
substantive--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
certainly,
if
we
are
able
to
persuade
the
court
that
the
threshold
language
is
satisfied
here,
that
is
that
these
documents
are
properly
regarded
as
interagency
or
intraagency
memorandums
or
letters,
we
would
still
have
to
persuade
presumably
the
court
of
appeals
on
remand
that
the
documents
would
be
privileged--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--and
in
the
past--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
with
respect,
i
think
the
court's
general
methodology
has
been
to
construe
the
threshold
language
of
the
various
exemptions
in
a
way
that
would
protect
the
values
that
the
body
of
the
exemption
is
intended
to
protect,
and
the
court
has
said,
in
a
shorthand
formulation
admittedly,
that
exemption
5
protects
those
documents,
and
only
those
documents
that
would
be
privileged
in
civil
discovery.
i
mean,
the
point
is,
most
of
the
work
here
is
supposed
to
be
done
by
the
inquiry
into
whether
there
is
actually
an
applicable
privilege.
it
maybe
that
the
threshold
language
will
screen
out
some
things
that
would
be
privileged
in
discovery,
but
there's
no
indication,
either
in
the
legislative
history
or
in
this
court's
decisions,
that
the
threshold
language
is
supposed
to
screen
out
a
lot.
to
take
another
example--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but
i
think
it's
also
worth
emphasizing
that
the
one
alternative
that
i
think
is
not
clearly
on
the
table
is
to
give
the
threshold
language
an
absolutely
rigid
literal
interpretation.
that
is
to
say,
nothing
can
be--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
i
think
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
i
think
the
best
analogy
from
the
existing
case
law
is
to
the
senators
in
ryan
and
to
the
former
president
in
public
citizen.
that
is,
these
are
people
who
were
not
literally
part
of
any
foia
agency,
and
who
were
consulted
not
because
they
were
expected
to
perform
exactly
the
same
role
as
an
agency
employee.
rather,
they
were
consulted
because
they
were
believed
to
have
a
distinct
institutional
perspective.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
certainly
the
archivist
was
ultimately
going
to
be
making
the
determination
whether
particular
documents
would
be
made
public
or
not,
and
in
other
private
individuals
such
as
public--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
know
that
it
had
progressed
to
quite
that
point,
but
certainly
the
point
of
the
scheme
was
that
private
parties
would
like
to
have
as
much
information
as
possible
from
the
former
president's
records
in
order
to
do
whatever
type
of
research
they
wanted
to
do,
and
the
former
president
was
being
consulted
because
of
his
own
distinct
perspective,
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
the...
certainly
congress
over
the
years
has
revisited,
has
amended
the
foia
in
various
respects.
it's
not--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
i
think
we
are
not...
i
think
we're
not
asking
for
a
stretch,
because
the
united
states
in
its
capacity
as
trustee,
and
in
particular
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
owes
a
duty
of
loyalty
to
the
tribes,
and
certainly
federal
policy
for
most
of
the
20th
century
has
been
to
exercise
the
trusteeship
in
a
way
that
will
promote
values
of
tribal
self-determination,
so
if
the
united
states
as
trustee--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
would
agree
that
the
tribes'
potential
financial
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
decision,
the
various
decisionmaking
processes
is
unlike
interests
that
have
been
recognized
in
the
past,
but
again
the
united
states
is
supposed
to
act
as
the
trustee.
one
of
the
central
duties
of
a
trustee
in
virtually
every
context
is
to
preserve
a
duty
of
confidentiality
to
the
beneficiary,
and
so
it
would
be
strange
to
say
that
the
tribe's
status
as
a
beneficiary,
the
tribe's
interest
in
the
trust
corpus,
is
the
very
thing
that
causes
its
submissions
to
lose
the
confidentiality
that
they
might
otherwise
have.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
certainly
in
litigation
the
particular
needs
of
an
individual
requestor
would
be
relevant
in
a
way
that
they
would
not
be
relevant
under
the
foia,
so
i
think
your
question...
the
premise
of
your
question
is
correct
in
two
different
respects.
first,
the
fact
that
these
are
in
our
view
interagency
documents
doesn't
automatically
mean
that
they
would
even
satisfy
the
second
part
of
the
foia
test.
second,
even
if
they
satisfied
the
second
part
of
the
foia
test
in
the
sense
that
they
would
not
be
routinely
discoverable,
that
wouldn't
by
itself
eliminate
the
possibility
that
they
could
be
discovered
by
a
litigant
with
a
particular
need.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i'd
like
to
address
the
question
of
the
role
of
the
government
in
allocating
a
scarce
benefit,
and
particularly
with
regard
to
the
oregon
general
stream
adjudication.
i
think
as
the
court
is
certainly
aware,
the
way
that
a
priority
system
of
water
rights
works
is
the
most
senior
water
user
gets
whatever
rights
it's
entitled
to,
and
then
if
there's
water
remaining
the
next
most
senior,
and
so
forth
down
the
line,
and
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
the
oregon
adjudication,
and
a
position
which
was
upheld
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
adair,
is
that
the
tribes
have
a
priority
date
earlier
than
that
of
the
klamath
project.
and
there
are
questions
remaining
as
to
the
quantification
of
that
right,
but
when
the
united
states
presents
claims
on
behalf
of
the
tribe,
if
the
united
states
believed
that
the
tribes
was
entitled
to
a
certain
amount
of
water
but
nevertheless
asserted
claims
for
a
lesser
amount
in
order
that
more
should
be
left
over
for
the
project,
we
would
be
breaching
our
fiduciary
duty
to
the
tribes.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
again,
we
think
that
the
ultimate
question
should
be
whether
the
government
has
solicited...
in
this
case
whether
the
government
has
solicited
input
from
a
person
technically
outside
the
four
walls
of
the
government
based
on
a
distinct
perspective
which
is
particularly
useful
to
the
government,
and
an
analogy--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it's
not
the
same
sort
of
relationship
between
the
government
and
the
water
users
that
exists
between
the
government
and
the
tribe.
that
is,
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--certainly
we
are
arguing
that
the
trust
relationship
is,
we
would
say
is
one
example
of
a
broader
principle.
another
analogy
would
be
to
our
representation
of
current
and
former
federal
employees
in
bivens
suits,
where
the
federal
employee
obviously
has
a
personal
stake
in
the
outcome
of
the
litigation.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
but
the
attorney-client
privilege
would
kick
in
only
if
the
threshold
language
of
interagency
or
intraagency
were
satisfied,
so
certainly
with
respect
to
former
employees
i
think
the
necessary
implication
of
the
opponents'
test
is,
no
matter
how
privileged
the
communications
were,
they
would
nevertheless
be
disclosable
under
foia
because
they
could
not
be
characterized
as
interagency
or
intraagency
documents.
thank
you,
your
honor.
