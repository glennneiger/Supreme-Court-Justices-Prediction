by
doi,
department
of
the
interior?
unknown
speaker
mr.
stewart,
there
was
some
long-term
plan
for
this
water
basin
that
was
being
considered?
unknown
speaker
has
that
been
abandoned?
unknown
speaker
is
it
still
under
preparation?
unknown
speaker
is
it
ongoing?
unknown
speaker
so
in
the
oregon
litigation
i
take
it
then
the
united
states
is
really
acting
as
counsel
for
the
tribes?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
the
claims
that
the
tribes'
lawyers
are
supporting
the
claims
that
the
united
states
filed,
or
are
they
separate
claims?
unknown
speaker
so--
unknown
speaker
--so
your
interests...
with
that
minor
exception,
your
interests
are
identical.
counsel,
technically,
is
separate?
unknown
speaker
okay.
but
isn't
it
true
the
united
states
has
an
interest
other
than
just
representing
the
tribes'
interest?
unknown
speaker
if
there
were
a
separation
of
responsibility
within
the
united
states
presentations
and
if
these
documents
had
been
given
to
the
right
hand
rather
than
the
left
hand
of
the
united
states,
would
you
still
say
they
were
privileged?
unknown
speaker
but
wasn't
there
some
effort
at
the
time
the
foia
was
drafted
or
amended
to
put
in
an
exemption
for
a
trustee
which
congress
turned
down?
unknown
speaker
certainly
what
you
have
here
does
not
literally
fill
that
bill,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
why
would
they
go
about
that
business...
why
wouldn't
they
simply
read
what
the
statute
says?
unknown
speaker
did
they
call
it
a
consultative
privilege?
unknown
speaker
people
that
the
agency
hires
to
do
work
that
the
agency
would
otherwise
do?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
assert
that
all
tribal
communications
with
the
federal
government
concerning
tribal
resources
are
always
exempt
from
disclosure
under
foia,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
you
say
as
a
trustee.
where
do
you
get
that
out
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
but
that--
--but
the
tribe
is
not
an
agency.
unknown
speaker
so
it's
literally
not
covered.
unknown
speaker
well,
okay,
but--
--it
isn't
a
matter
of
being...
it
seems
to
me
all
of...
almost
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals
cases
you're
referring
to
do
deal
with
consultants
who
have
been
hired
by
the
government
to
further
the
government's
own
interests.
this
is
really
part
of
the
government's
operating.
the
tribe
here
was
not
seeking
to
further
the
government's
interests
at
all.
it
was
seeking
to
further
its
own
interests.
i
think
it's
a
stretch
beyond
what
most
of
these
courts
of
appeals
cases...
which
i
agreed
with.
i
mean,
i've
spoken
to
that
in
an
earlier
case,
but
this
seems
to
me
to
take
it
a
step
further,
and
i
can
see
how
you
can
get
to
the
conclusion
that
a
consultant
whom
you
hire,
any
memorandum
produced
by
that
consultant
who
was
hired
by
you
is
an
intraagency
memorandum.
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
leap
to
the
conclusion
that
anything
that
is
given
to
you
by
a
trustee,
by
a
trust,
is
an
intraagency
memorandum.
i
mean,
maybe
it
should
be
confidential,
but
i
find
it
hard
to
call
that
an
intraagency
memorandum.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
it
was
surely...
i
mean,
the
senate
didn't
have
its
own
ax
to
grind
when
it
was
giving
the
justice
department
information
about
judicial
nominees.
it
was
certainly
trying
to
further
the
government's
interest,
not
its
own
interest.
unknown
speaker
in
that
view,
if
the
klamath
water
users'
association
had
submitted
these
documents,
would
they
also
be
privileged
from
disclosure?
unknown
speaker
so
then
it's
not
the
deliberative
process
privilege
that
we're
talking
about
at
all.
it's
simply
this
trust
relationship.
unknown
speaker
no,
but--
--and
yet
you
concede
that
the
trust
relationship
in
itself
doesn't
create
any
exemption
under
foia,
and
mr.
stewart,
this
is
the
problem
that
i
have
with
the
picture
here.
it's
the
one-way-street
aspect
of
it.
i
mean,
you
said
the
united
states
has
made
claims
on
behalf
of
the
water
association,
too.
unknown
speaker
where
they
have
the
same
interest,
where
there's
an
identity
of
interest
between...
the
united
states
might
agree
with
the
users
on
some
of
the
questions,
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
what...
but,
and
the
users
and
the
tribes
are
in,
at
least
in
tension
on
some
of
these
issues.
one
of
the
statements
made
is
that
the
united
states
has
been
routinely
turning
over
what
it
gets
from
the
water
association
to
the
tribes,
so
the
information...
the
tribes
get
information
from
one
side
that
has
a
stake
in
this
venture,
but
that
side
doesn't
get
what
the
tribe
is
giving
to
the
government,
so
it
looks
like
it's
not
evenhanded.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
isn't
the
value
of
that
emphasis,
if
it
has
any
value
at
all,
only
proportional
to
the
independence
of
bia
from
the
rest
of
the
department
of
interior,
because
i
think
the
questions
of
several
of
my
colleagues
here
have
raised
the
same
point.
if
the
bia
is
not
independent
of
them,
then
your
analogy
between
the
tribes
and
the
consultants
fails.
if
we
accept
the
consultant
situation
as
being
inter
or
intraagency,
we
can
rationalize
it
by
saying,
as
several
have
said,
that
the
consultants
really
are
doing
something
that
the
department
itself
might
be
doing.
it's
an
extension
of
the
department.
it's
reportable
only
to
the
department.
but
if,
in
fact,
the
indian
tribes
are
consulting
with
an
agency
which
is
concerned
not
only
with
the
indian
tribes'
interests,
but
in
adjusting
those
interests
as
against
the
interests
of
other
claimants,
which
seems
to
be
the
case
here,
then
you
don't
have
an
analogy
with
a
situation
in
which
the
department
and
the
consultant
alone
are
involved,
so
it
seems
to
me
your
whole
argument
either
stands
or
falls
on
the
independence
of
bia,
and
we
know
that
the
bia
is
not
somehow
totally
independent
of
the
rest
of
the
department
of
the
interior,
whether
it's
preparing
a
kpop
or
whether
it's
representing
the
united
states
in
oregon
litigation.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
true,
but
i
mean
the
problem
comes
because
the
department
has
responsibilities
to
other
people,
too
and
it
is...
in
effect,
on
your
view
of
the
freedom
of
information
act,
it
is
able
to
favor
one
side
with
information
while
denying
an
equal,
in
effect
an
equal
access
to
another
side,
and--
unknown
speaker
--that's
the
real
rub
in
deciding
whether
we
should
stretch
the
freedom
of
information
act
language
broadly
enough
to
in
effect
allow
the
united
states
to
grant
privileges
to
one
of
the
interest
groups
it's
supposed
to
favor,
the
indians,
as
against
the
other
interest
groups,
water
users,
the
general
public,
what-not,
and
that's
a
great
stretch.
unknown
speaker
but
i
think
your
position
here
today
is,
it
didn't
have
to
be,
that
it
could
claim
an
exemption
with
respect
to
whatever
it
gets
from
the
tribes.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
stewart,
your
argument
would
be
very
convincing
if
congress
had
enacted
that
trustee
thing,
but
it
didn't.
unknown
speaker
but
also
that
the
exemption
shall
be
narrowly
construed.
the
court
has
said
that
repeatedly.
the
main
rule
is,
disclose
unless
you
fit
into
one
of
these
exemptions,
and
the
exemptions
are
to
be
tightly
construed.
unknown
speaker
but
the
question
is
whether
it
fits
within...
the
words
for
the
exemption
are
interagency.
that's
what
has
to
be
strictly
construed.
unknown
speaker
once
you
get
past
that,
then
there's
an
issue
that
isn't
even
before
us
now
whether
these
are
deliberative
and
whatever
else.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
we
can't
construe
the
exemption
as
if
it
were
an
exemption
only
for
privileged
material,
because
we've
got
inter
or
intraagency
language
that
has
somehow
got
to
be
satisfied
before
we
get
to
the
question
of
privilege.
unknown
speaker
okay,
and
we've
been
assuming
in
our
arguments,
at
least
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that
we
wouldn't
be
so
literal
as
to
exclude
the
relationship
between
the
consultant
and
the
agency,
but
the
analogy
between
the
consultant
and
the
agency
fails
here
because
the
agency
here
is
in
fact
wearing
more
than
one
hat.
it's
in
the
role
of
an
advocate,
or
the
role
of
an
adjudicator,
vis-a-vis
the
indian
tribe,
so
that
analogy
doesn't
work,
and
it
seems
to
me
the
only
way
you
can
win
is
to
say,
well,
come
up
with
a
new
exception,
or
a
new
interpretation
of
inter
or
intraagency,
and
i
haven't
heard
what
that
is
yet.
if
we
don't
accept
the
analogy
with
the
consultant--
unknown
speaker
--and
we
don't
have
another
model
for
a
construction
or
an
exception,
then
i
think
you're...
then
i
think
you
have
to
lose.
unknown
speaker
okay,
was
the
united
states
in
that
case
in
the
position,
formally
or
informally
of
adjudicating
the
interests,
say
of
the
president
vis-a-vis
somebody
else?
unknown
speaker
but
at
the
time
the
privilege
was
recognized,
or
the
exemption
was
recognized,
was
the
archivist
in
the
situation
of
saying,
well,
i
have
the
president
telling
me
to
do
one...
or
whoever
it
was...
telling
me
to
do
one
thing
and
a
bunch
of
historians
want
me
to
do
something
else,
so
i'll
consult
with
the
president,
and
my
consultation
with
him
should
be
exempt.
was
that
the
situation?
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
the
exemption
shouldn't
have
been
recognized
in
that
situation,
then.
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
asking
for
a
stretch
even
beyond
that,
because
this...
the
adversary
nature
of
the
tribes'
interests
versus
the
water
users'
interests.
unknown
speaker
what
i
mean
is,
that's
a
new
element
that
wasn't...
it's
not
like
the
paid
consultant
who's
substituting
for
an
employee,
it's
not
like
the
senate
that's
representing
the
u.s.
government,
and
it's
not
like
the
president.
you
are
asking
for
something
that
no
other
case
is
like.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
completely
clear
that
that
confidentiality
is
also
a
defense
to
discovery
in
litigation.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
hitchings,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
if
an
ordinary
person
has
a
trustee...
in
fact,
any
one
of
millions
of
americans
indeed
do
have
a
trustee
they
have
to
give
confidential...
they
give
confidential
documents
to,
it
would
be
privileged
in
litigation,
like
attorney-client
work
privilege.
there's
no
way
for
adversaries
to
get
those
documents,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
so
if
you're
an
indian,
however,
a
member
of
an
indian
tribe,
you
do
exactly
the
same
thing
because
your
government
happens
to
be
the
trustee,
opponents
in
litigation
could
get
it,
so
the
court
privileges
would
be
useless
to
them.
i
mean,
insofar
as
they
have
to
give
documents
to
their
trustees,
all
the
court
privileges
would
be
useless.
i'm
not
saying
that
means
you'd
lose,
but
i
want
to
be
sure
that's
the
consequence.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
the
consequence.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
if
that's
the
consequence,
then
what
i'm
looking
for
is,
it
seems
an
undesirable
consequence,
and
therefore
i
wonder
if
their
status
isn't
unique
enough
to
analogize
them
to
consultants.
that's
basically...
i
mean,
it's
like
nothing
else.
the
indian
tribe
relationship
is
totally
unique,
and
there's
a
choice
of
analogies,
and
i
agree
with
you
that
it's
a
stretch
of
the
language,
but
consultants
is
a
stretch
of
the
language,
so
shouldn't
we
try
to
see
if
that
can't
be
done
in
order
to
prevent
the
consequence
that
i
just
described?
unknown
speaker
it
didn't
seem
to
me
that's
what
would
be
relevant
to
the
questions
that
i'm
asking,
or
necessarily
to
the
holding
of
the
case.
that
is,
if
we
held
they're
not
within
the
agency
exception,
they
are
not
within
it,
and
therefore
whatever
documents
they
give
to
the
trustee,
whether
it
happened
to
be
your
situation
or
any
other
situation
in
the
world,
would
be
absolutely...
other
people
would
get
them.
the
court
privileges
would
be
useless
to
the
indians,
and
that
would
be
not
only
true
in
your
situation,
it
would
be
true
in
every
situation,
if
they
don't
fall
within
this.
now,
that's
what's
worrying
me.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hitchings,
i
guess
you
believe
that
the
moral
is
you
should
never
pick
a
trustee
who
enacts
a
freedom
of
information
act.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
i'm
not
sure
the
indians
had
a
choice.
i
mean,
the
congress--
--alternative
moral,
if
you
are
a
trustee
you
should
not
enact
a
freedom
of
information
act.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
way
to
work
with
that,
because
i
would
normally
think,
you
know,
that
people
get
sued,
and
tribes
get
sued
like
any
other
entity
for
millions
of
things,
accidents,
contracts,
who
knows?
i
mean,
there
are
30
million
lawsuits,
or
i
don't
know,
10
million
anyway,
and
in
each
of
those
lawsuits
they
would
be
unable
to
use
the
privileges
that
are
given
to
every
other
litigant
if
they
turned
over
documents,
as
they
normally
would
in
the
course
of
business,
to
their
trustee.
now,
is...
you
say,
well
this
is
a
special
situation
as
described.
is
there
any
way
to
work
with
that
that
it
could
make
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
don't
the
tribes
generally,
in
matters
of
contract
or
tort,
refer
to...
they
have
their
own
attorneys,
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hitchings,
i
think
that
mr.
stewart
said
that
this
case,
if
we
got
past
interagency,
would
be
on
the
deliberative
process.
nobody
is
claiming
in
this
case
that
the
united
states
has
an
attorney-client
relationship
that
would
bring
forth
a
privilege.
i
think
that
mr.
stewart
agreed
with
that,
so
if
we...
if
exemption
5
applied
at
all,
we
would
be
looking
to
the
deliberative
process
privilege
but
not
to
attorney-client
or
work
product,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
if
the
government
cannot
prevail
under
section
5,
are
there
as
to
these
two
documents
as
to
which
work
product
was...
will
the
work
product
privilege
protect
those
independently
of
section
5?
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
they
may
even
be
adverse
to
each
other
in
certain
respects,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
well,
now
i
don't
understand
that.
i
thought
that
in
order
to
work,
5,
you
have
to
satisfy
two
things.
first,
you
don't
even
get
there
unless
it's
interagency,
and
if
you
are
there,
it's
still
not
protected
unless
you
can
assert
a
privilege
that
you
could
assert
in
a
litigation.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
so
in
other
words,
the
only
things
that
you...
the
only...
if
it
applies,
it
only
creates
privacy
in
respect
to
the
following
things,
those
things
that,
independently,
litigation
privilege
creates
privacy
for.
now,
am
i
right
about
that,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
that's...
you
see,
that's
why
i'm
worried,
because
we're
only
talking
about
things
that
would
otherwise
be
privileged,
and
now
they
lose
that
privilege.
i'm
just
repeating
myself,
but
i'm
explaining
why
i'm
worried
to
try
to
get
from
you
something
that
will
make
me
less
worried.
unknown
speaker
medical
records,
are
medical
records
privileged
under
foia?
unknown
speaker
i
think
they're
specifically
mentioned
in
that
provision,
medical
records
and
other...
whose
disclosure
would
constitute
an
unwarranted
invasion
of
privacy,
but
that
provision
letters
that
would
not
be
available,
memorandums
or
letters
which
would
not
be
available
by
law
to
a
party
other
than
an
agency
in
litigation,
that
isn't...
that
goes
well
beyond
just
attorney-client
material,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
i
thought
that
was
a
fairly
expansive
provision,
and
if
it
were
not
routinely
available
in
litigation,
it
benefits
from
that.
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
that
the
petitioner
would
ultimately
lose,
even
though
satisfying
the
interagency
requirement,
because
of
the
routinely
available
of
discovery
product.
unknown
speaker
suppose
that
we
thought...
i
may
be
taking
it
out
of
context,
but
justice
scalia
once
wrote
that
that's
exemption...
said
something
about
including
any
agency
document
that
is
part
of
the
deliberative
process.
just
taking
that
phrase,
suppose
it
was
possible
to
read
section
5
in
that
way,
would
your
documents
come
into
that,
too,
not
the
ones
you
want,
but
your
own
submissions?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
wasn't
dissenting
on
this
point.
i
just
had
to
reach
this
point
because
of
my
dissent,
whereas
the
majority
didn't
have
to
reach
it,
so--
unknown
speaker
--the
court
hasn't
really
addressed
it--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
mr.
hitchings.
mr.
stewart,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
the
more
difficult
question,
if
you
want
to
take
30
seconds,
is
how
do
you
get
the
tribe
beneficiary
into
interagency
even
if
you
couldn't
get
consultants
in
there?
unknown
speaker
why
doesn't
that
cover
the
water
users
association,
distinct
perspective,
technical,
why
not?
unknown
speaker
you're
arguing
for
a
trustee
exception,
basically,
just--
unknown
speaker
--attorney-client.
