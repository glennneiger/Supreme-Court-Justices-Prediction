mr.

william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
stern.
mr.
minear,
we
will
hear
from
you.

rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
ms.
ludtke,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
shouldn't
all
of
this
have
been
fleshed
out
in
the
1976
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
with
the...
these
are
all...
that
refers
to
the
1976
litigation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
in
fact
the
choice
of
that
starting
point
also
leads
to
other
perfectly
logical
conclusions,
isn't
nh
bound
by
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
doesn't
certainly
mean
that
maine
necessarily
agreed
with
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
ludtke.
mr.
stern,

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stern.
the
case
is
submitted.
