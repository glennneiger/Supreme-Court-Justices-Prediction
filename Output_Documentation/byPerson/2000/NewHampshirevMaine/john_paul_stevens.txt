justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask...
you
say
there
is
no
actual
adjudication,
but
paragraph
four
was
a
subject
of
dispute
within
this
court.
three
of
us
dissented
from
paragraph
four.
how
can
you
say
there
wasn't
an
actual
decision
on
that
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
just
repeating
justice
white's
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
just
repeating
justice
white's
argument
that
the
court
rejected.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
then--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
i
understand
you
correctly,
if
you
were
counsel
for
nh
in
1976
and
you
then
knew
what
you
now
know,
would
you
have
signed
this
decree?
