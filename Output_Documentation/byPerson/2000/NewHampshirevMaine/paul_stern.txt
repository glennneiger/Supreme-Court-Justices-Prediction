mr.
paul
stern
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
the
court
today
is
made
motion
to
dismiss
new
hampshire's
complaint
on
res
judicata
grounds.
by
its
complaint,
new
hampshire
seeks
to
redraw
its
boundaries--
mr.
paul
stern
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
stern
i
apologize.
by
its
complaint,
new
hampshire
seeks
to
re-draw
its
boundary
with
maine
by
moving
the
border
from
the
middle
of
the
river
onto
maine's
shoreline
along
the
piscatagua
river.
in
1976,
this
court
held
that
the
king's
1740
order
permanently
fixed
the
boundary
as
the
quote
middle
of
the
river
closed
quote.
the
consent
decree
approved
by
this
court
in
1977,
according
to
new
hampshire
at
the
time
in
a
brief
reproduced
at
149a
of
new
hampshire's
appendix,
that
decree
quote...
contains
specific
findings
and
rulings
and
sets
forth
the
precise
factual
basis
and
legal
principles
upon
which
it,
the
decree,
is
founded...

king's
order,

language.
paragraph

of
that
decree

or
legal
principle

in
the

order,

means,
not
surprisingly,
middle
of
the
piscataqua

of
navigation
of
the
piscataqua
river.
mr.
paul
stern
no,
paragraph

the
1977
decree

or
noted
or
ruled
that

used
in
the
1740
order,

middle
of
the
river,

means
middle
of
the
main

of
navigation
of
the
piscataqua
river.
in
fact--
mr.
paul
stern
--hopefully
it
will
not
come
up
again,
as
this
is
the
third
time
it
has
come
up.
the
1976
opinion
of
this
court
confirmed
that
the
1740
king's
decree
permanently
fixed,
permanently
set
the
boundary
at
the
quote...
middle
of
the
river...
closed

mr.
paul
stern
that
would
be
the
commissioner's
report...
it's
at,
i
believe,
14(a)
attached
to
our
appendix,
or
attached
to
our
brief.
and
i
believe
that
21(a)
or
22(a)
is
the
king's
affirmance
of
that.
mr.
paul
stern
no,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
stern
at
the--
mr.
paul
stern
--i
apologize,
your
honor.
it's
7(a).
two
points
i
would
like
to
make
in
response
to
your
questions.
first--
mr.
paul
stern
--no.
our
brief...
we're
the
moving
party.
mr.
paul
stern
second
paragraph.
mr.
paul
stern
second
paragraph.
it
is
affirmed,
by
the
way,
on
21
or
22(a).
getting
back
to
your
question,
your
honor...
two
points
i
would
like
to
make.
first,
by
necessity
the
terminus
point
of
the
lateral
marine
boundary
from
the
isles
of
shoals
to
the
river...
you
have
to
determine
where
the
location
of
the
boundary
is
in
the
river.
that's
clear
from
the
very
first
pleading...
the
complaint
filed
by
nh
in
1973
where
on
the
very
first
page
they
state
that
the
boundary
between
the
two
states
is
described
in
1740
king's
decree
as
the
middle
of
the
river.
so
by
necessity,
one--
mr.
paul
stern
--the
decree
on
its
face
in
paragraph
four,
without
reservation,
gives
meaning
to
the
phrase
quote...
middle
of
the
river
from
the
1740--
mr.
paul
stern
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
paul
stern
the
maine--
mr.
paul
stern
--the
1977
decree
is
reproduced
attached
to
the
united
states
brief...
the
gray
brief...
and
i
believe
the--
mr.
paul
stern
--i
misunderstood,
your
honor.
i
thought
you
were
referring
to
the
1740
decree.
if
one
looks
at
2(a),
paragraph
four,
without
reservation,
gives
meaning
to
the
term
quote...
middle
of
the
river,
closed
quote...
from
the
1740
decree
as
the
middle
of
the
main
navigational
channel
of
the
piscataqua
river.
paragraph
five
that
i
wanted
to
get
to
applies
that
principle
to
the
river.
it
applies
the
principle
by
laying
out
in
miles
of
the
river
from
its
mouth
all
the
way
up
to
fishing
island.
of
note
in
the
dissenting
opinion
written
by
justice
white,
it's
noted
that
maine
strongly
objected
to
the
proposed
geographic
midline
of
the
special
map
there
because
of
the
substantial
areas
that
maine
would
lose
to
nh
in
both
the
river
and
harbor
and
seaward
thereof.
before
this
court,
maine's
assistant
attorney
general
argued...
and
it's
at
104
to
105(a)
of
new
hampshire's
appendix...
that
as
much
of
an
objection
as
maine
has
to
the
effect
of
the
geographic
lines
with
respect
to
losing
territory
off
the
coastline
outside
the
harbor,
maine
felt
much
more...
a
much
greater
prejudice
from
the
effects
inside
the
harbor.
to
the
extent
that
the
impression
was
left
that
nobody
was
thinking
about
it
or
nobody
was
arguing
with
respect
to
the
rest
of
the
river,
that
simply
is
not
true
from
both
the--
mr.
paul
stern
--exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
stern
i
assume,
yes.
mr.
paul
stern
that's
logical.
either
approach
would
result
in
the
motion--
mr.
paul
stern
--we
agree,
your
honor.
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
suggestion
that
nh
had
no
reason
or
no
incentive
to
press
a
claim
to
the
shoreline
back
in
the
1970s,
that
is
simply
wrong.
indeed,
in
response
to
the
special
master's
report,
nh
filed
exceptions
seeking
to
move
the
middle
of
the
river
line
three
hundred
and
fifty
feet
closer
to
maine
shore.
if
the
shoreline
boundary
was
correct...
if
they
pressed
it
back
then...
the
line
would
be
moved
not
three
hundred
and
fifty
feet
but
over
half
a
mile
onto
maine
shoreline,
obviously
resulting
in
a
substantial
additional
amount
of
territory
being
in
nh
rather
than
maine.
to
the
extend
that
there
is
the
suggestion
that
the
middle
of
the
river
could
possibly
mean
the
shoreline,
that
is
diffused
by
nh's
own...
not
only
the
decree
on
its
face,
paragraph
four
in
particular
and
its
application
in
paragraph
five,
but
also
with
respect
to
nh's
own
pleadings
at
the
time
on
brief
where
at
the
brief
at
459(a)
of
maine's
appendix,
nh
explained
that
when
quote...
middle
of
the
river...
closed
quote,
must
be
interpreted,
there
are
two
possible
interpretations...
salvaig
or
geographic
middle.
nh
at
the
time
did
not
identify
maine's
shoreline
as
a
possibility,
because
nh
had
the--
mr.
paul
stern
--that's
what
we
have
been
saying,
your
honor.
we
are
here
on
a
complaint
seeking
to
in
effect
that
quote...
middle
of
the
river,
closed
quote...
does
not
mean
the
middle
of
the
river,
but
it
is
more
peculiar
because
of
the
result
of
the
decree
in
1977.
at
least
the
first
mile
of
the
river
is
laid
out
as
the
middle
of
the
river.
nh
appears
to
agree
that
once
we
get
up
to
the
head
of
tide
near
salmon
falls,
we
jumped
back
into
the
middle
of
the
river
again,
because
apparently
the
1740
decree
describes
the
boundary
up
there
as
the
middle
of
the
nuashanog.
so
the
middle
of
the
river
means
the
middld
of
the
river
at
the
mouth.
middle
of
the
river
means
middle
of
the
river
at
its
head,
but
middle
of
the
river
does
not
mean
middle
of
the
river,
according
to
nh,
in
the
middle
section
of
the
river.
it
becomes
even
more
peculiar,
becuase
it
appears
that
nh
conceives
that
virtually
all,
if
not
all,
of
the
islands
on
maine's
side
of
the
middle
of
the
river,
except
the
shipyard
island,
are
in
maine.
so
it
has
this
jogging
boundaries
with
all
the
islands
except
one
are
in
the
state
of
maine.
mr.
paul
stern
we
would
disagree
with
that
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first,
we've
argued
both
claim
and
issue
of
preclusion.
in
our
view,
it's
because
of
the
transaction
of
the
meaning
and
applicability
of
the
1740
king's
decree
was
before
the
court
in
the
1970s,
in
particular
with
respect
to
the
location
of
the
boundary
in
the
river,
nh
was
precluded
from
today
coming
in
presenting
a
different
theory
as
to
the
meaning
and
applicability
of
the
1740
decree.
mr.
paul
stern
not
exactly,
because
back
in
the
1970s,
as
it
has
been
explained
previously,
by
necessity
it
was
essential
to
determine
the
location
of
the
boundary
in
the
river
and,
in
fact,
the
decree
applied
the
principle
to
a
portion
of
the
river.
but
we
understand,
as
is
obvious
by
comparing
the
united
states'
brief
and
maine's
brief,
that
reasonable
minds
can
differ
as
to
whether
we're
talking
about
a
claim
or
an
issue.
we
believe
the
claim
preclusion
issue
and
preclusion
are
different
paths
that
get
to
the
same
spot
res
judicata,
but--
mr.
paul
stern
--exactly.
mr.
paul
stern
yes.
if
it
is
a
quote...
consent
decree...
closed
quote,
and
we
would
argue
that
this
is
not
the
type
of
consent
decree
described
in,
for
example,
international
building,
because
here
this
court
made
an
independent
determination
that
the
1740
king's
order
and
not
the
proposed
consent
decree
permanently
fixed
the
boundary
as
the
middle
of
the
river.
we
would
also
suggest
that
looking
at,
in
particular
paragraph
four
of
the
1977
decree,
that
that
according
to
nh,
as
we
have
related,
is
a
specific
finding
or
ruling
or
legal
principle
with
respect
to
the
entire
river
because,
in
particular
in
paragraph
five,
it
was
applied
to
a
portion
of
the
river.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
now,
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
stern
thank
you,
your
honor.
there
has
been
a
suggestion
today
that
the
river
does
not
equal
harbor.
a
special
master
at
the
time
was
pretty
sure
that
the
harbor
and
the
river
were
coextensive.
nh
back
in
the
1970s
specifically
stated
that
the
mouth
of
the
harbor
is
the
same
as
the
mouth
of
the
river.
mr.
paul
stern
gosport
harbor
is
the
harbor
out
at
the
isle
of
shoals.
out
at
the
islands
in
the
sea.
mr.
paul
stern
piscataqua
harbor
or
portsmouth
harbor
is
the
one
we're
talking
about.
mr.
paul
stern
but
in
the
1970s
nh
was
pretty
clear
that
mouth
of
the
harbor
equalled
mouth
of
the
river
and
they
stated
that
in
pleadings
to
this
court
at
315(a)
and
329(a)
of
maine's
appendix.
mr.
paul
stern
the
whole
river
was
before
the
court
because
what's
been
lsot
in
the
argument
here,
i
believe,
was
that
therre
were
two
main
events,
so
to
speak,
with
respect
to
the
1970s
litigation.
one
was
whether
the
line
going
out
from
the
portsmouth
harbor
to
the
isles
of
shoals
was
straight
or
crooked
in
some
way.
mr.
paul
stern
the
second
one,
which
is
the
one
that
the
dissent
addressed,
was
where
in
the
river
was
the
boundary
because
depending
upon
where
it
was...
geographic
middle,
solweig,
or
the
maine
shoreline,
it
would
determine
how
much
territory
was
in
each
state.
but
to
suggest
that
nh
didn't
have
the
incentive
to
claim
a
shoreline
in
maine
is...
borders
on
implausible
because
it
would
have
resulted
in
hundreds
if
not
thousands
of
additional
acres
of
territory
being
in
nh
rather
than
maine.
they
would
have
called
it
nh
special
exceptions.
to
the
special
message,
i
argue
to
this
court
that
the
boundary
should
be
moved
over
a
bit...
three
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
the
middle
of
the
river...
to
get
some
additional
territory.
a
shoreline
boundary
would
have
increased
that
manyfold,
so
nh
had
the
incentive
to
press
a
claim
to
the
shoreline
boundary.
the
notion
that
we
can
suggest
today
that
the
attorneys
general
in
the
1970s
didn't
know
anything...
didn't
know
what
we
know
today...
is
exactly
why
we
have
res
judicata.
the
circus
of
what
we
almost
would
have
to
do
is
bring
those
folks
back
in
and
cross-examining
them
is
why
we
have
res
judicata.
nh
had
the
opportunity
to
press
a
shoreline
boundary
which
had
all
the
incentive
and
the
fair
opportunity
to
do
it
in
the
1970s.
its
failure
to
do
so
precludes
it
from
doing
so
now,
and
the
reason
we
have
these
specific
findings,
rulings
and
legal
principles
accoridng
to
nh,
as
they
explained
in
the
1970s
was
to
avoid
the
vermont
v.
new
york
problem
where
there
was
a
decree
without
findings,
without
an
adjudication
of
any
issues.
because
of
that
concern
that
this
decree
might
not
be
approved,
these
specific
findings
and
rulings
and
legal
principles
were
laid
out
here,
and
they
are
made
without
reservation.
getting
back
to
justice
breyer's
question,
paragraph
five,
if
we
can
read
the
line,
says
quote...
the
middle
of
the
main
channel
of
navigation
of
the
piscataqua
river,
commencing
in
the
vicinity
of
fort
point
and
fishing
island...
so
it's
an
effort...
maybe
not
an
exact
effort,
but
it's
an
effort
to
lay
out
the
middle
of
the
main
channel
of
navigation
of
the
piscataqua
river.
there
may
have
been
reasons
to
have
it
as
a
straight
line
in
that
channel,
but
it
is
an
effort.
