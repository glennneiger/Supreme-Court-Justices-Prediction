justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it
starts...
so
that
phrase
in
paragraph
five
is
meant
to
pick
up
the
top
of
that
vertical
leg
and
go
down.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
it
goes
on
to
define
what
they're
talking
about,
and
they
say
the
middle
of
the
main
channel
of
navigation,
and
that's
why
i
ask
this
question,
and
they
say
is
that
blue
line.
okay?
so
that's
what
it
says
right
in
the
decree.
it
says
it's
that
blue
line.
at
least
that's
what
i
was
told.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
so
what's
the
issue?
here
you
agree
and
they
agree
that
in
a
consent
decree
entered
by
the
court
that
the
channel
is
that
blue
line.
now
you're
saying
it's
not
that
blue
line.
all
right,
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
can
you...
i'm
sorry
that
i
may
be...
looking
at
map
four,
what
part
are
you
talking
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
is
the
blue
dogleg.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
it
nh
wants?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sorry...
don't
assume
too
much...
assume
i
know
nothing
about
this.
look
at
the
blue
line...
it
is
not...
all
right.
look
at
the
blue
line
and
tell
me
what...
where
it
is
that
nh
wants
to
go.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
your
point
this...
i
look
at
that
map
four.
you
say
go
to
the
top
of
the
blue
line,
and
you
say
we're
not
talking
about
the
blue
line,
we're
talking
about
a
line
that
would
be
drawn
to
the
left
of
the
top
past
seabreeze
island.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
you're
also
adding
that
that
blue
line
represents
some
kind
of
compromise
in
the
case
that
doesn't
actually
make
very
much
sense
but
it
was
a
compromise.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
now
you're
saying
whatever
we
might
have
done
to
compromise
that
blue
line,
we
never
said
a
word
about
the
line
that
isn't
there,
and
by
the
way,
it
wasn't
in
the
case...
the
line
that
wasn't
there...
so
we
get
to
litigate
that
afresh.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
i
understand.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
is
there
any
theory...
is
there
any
theory
of
law
or
common
sense
or
anything
that
would
say,
all
right,
the
blue
line...
you
draw
the
line
at
the
lights,
but
the
line...
imaginary
line...
goes
off
to
the
left
past
seavey's
island,
you
don't
draw
at
the
lights.
now,
is
there
anybody
other
than
a
totally
illogical
person
who
could
defend
that
proposition?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
there
are
no
range
lights
the
other
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
that's
what
worried
me.
when
i
read
this
until
i
heard
you
actually,
i
thought,
well,
gee,
i
don't
understand
what
this
argument
is,
becuase
the
reading
of
this
decree
seems
to
say
when
you
take
the
middle
of
the
river
or
middle
of
the
harbor
or
middle
of
anything,
it
seems
to
take
the
main
channel
of
navigation
divided
down
the
river.
now,
you've
read
it
closely
and
you
say
that
this
part
of
it
wasn't
actually
an
issue.
well,
maybe
that's
true,
but
if
we
start
reopening
boundary
decrees,
it
seems
to
me
we
are
going
to
get
into
a
lot
of
trouble
because
there
may
be
a
lot
of
boundary
decrees
among
the
states
that
have
parts
that,
if
you
really
looked
at
them,
they
might
not
have
been
perfect
or
perfectly
described.
so
why
not
just
hold
you
to
this,
even
though
it
was
all
done
by
mistake
and
with
the
best
of
intentions
and
so
forth.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
wasn't
literally
decided,
because
it
wasn't
directly
an
issue
in
the
case.
i
assume
that
nonetheless
the
words
in
this
decree
surely
cover
it,
don't
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
answer
to
a
simple
argument
that
that
area
to
the
left...
you
go
to
the
top
of
the
blue
line,
you
look
left,
and
there's
a
dotted
line.
is
that
dotted
line...
whatever
we
said
in
that
decree,
it
wasn't
an
issue
in
the
case,
and
therefore
we
want
to
go
back
into
it.
