unknown
speaker
if
we
agree
with
your
position,
does
it
become
important
or
do
we
decide
here,
or
does
it
remain
in
dispute
whether
the
middle
means
the
geographic
middle
or
the
middle
of
the
channel?
unknown
speaker
but
what
i
guess
i'm
asking
is
it
necessary
then...
if
your
position
is
to
be
maintained...
that
we
refer
to
our
own
earlier
decree
as
opposed
to
simply
relying
on
the
1740
decree?
is
this
issue
going
to
come
up
again,
or
does
that
depend
on
how
we
write
the
decision
if
you
prevail?
unknown
speaker
where
is
that?
unknown
speaker
no?
unknown
speaker
where
is
it...
it
is
not
at
14(a)...
at
least
not
on
14(a)
of
your
brief.
that's
what
i'm
looking
for.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
7(a)
either.
you
want
to
try
again?
you're
talking
about
your
brief
in
opposition
to
the
motion
to
dismiss?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i'm
sorry.
your
brief...
i've
got
you.
i'm
looking
at
the
wrong...
i'm
with
you
now.
unknown
speaker
7(a).
unknown
speaker
and
what
page
is
that
on?
unknown
speaker
page
four,
which
is
where?
i'm
still
looking
for
the
decree.
i
can't
find
it.
unknown
speaker
the
'76
decree...
that's
what
we're
talking
about,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i've
been
asking
for.
i'm
trying
to
read
this--
unknown
speaker
just
as
a
matter
of
english
usage,
it
seems
when
you're
talking
about
the
middle
of
the
river
it
would
not
be
maine's
shoreline.
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
have
it,
mr.
minear.
unknown
speaker
for
those
of
us
that
do
have
it,
what
page?
unknown
speaker
when
you
said
that
definition
of
the
middle
of
the
river,
the
main
channel...
is
that
the
talveig,
or
just
the
channel
that
is
in
fact
used
by
the
ships?
unknown
speaker
and
how
does
that
help
us
as
we
proceed
north
through...
beyond
seavey's
island?
unknown
speaker
the
argument
is
being
made
that
the
normal
conditions
for
issue
preclusion
are
met
here
because
this
was
not
an
ordinary
consent
decree...
the
court
really
had
to
make
a
legal
determination
because
of
the
special
nature
of
the
court's
repsonsibilities
with
regard
to
boundary
disputes
between
the
states.
if
that
is
true,
i
can't
understand
how
the
court
could
have
simply
invented...
certainly
in
1740
they
meant
either
the
talveig
or
the
geographic
center
of
the
river.
i
mean...
i
don't
think
anybody
thought
in
1740
they
meant
the
usual
channel
of
navigation.
did
anybody
say
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
the
court
actually
decided
that
that's
what
the
1740
document
meant?
unknown
speaker
the
1740
decree
reasonably
referred
to
harbor
lights
that
were
planted
out
there
in
what...
1960?
unknown
speaker
so
this
all
comes
from
some
map?
the
range
line
is
marked
on
the
coast
and
did
that
survey
chart,
211,
etcetera.
unknown
speaker
but
you
said
how
you
argued
in
1977,
you
said
we
said,
which
i
think
is
something
that
you
said
in
the
past.
unknown
speaker
you
think
middle
of
the
harbor
was
also
not
relevant
to
that
decree?
unknown
speaker
we
have
that
four
says
the
terms
middle
of
the
river
and
middle
of
the
harbor
as
used
in
the
above
quoted
order
mean
the
middle
of
the
main
channel
of
navigation.
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
interrupt
you
to
get
one
thing
straight...
the
parties
signed
a
consent
decree,
but
this
court
didn't
enter
that
decree.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
where
is
the
consent
decree
in
the
materials
in
front
of
us?
i
have
the
order;
i
don't
know
where
the
consent
decree
is.
it's
in
page
1(a)
of
the
government's...
no,
that's
the
order,
i
thought.
are
you
talking
about
the
decree?
that's
right.
that's
not
what
she's
talking
about.
she
says
that
this
decree
does
say
middle
of
the
harbor,
but
she
says
that
the
parties'
consent
decree
did
not
say
middle
of
the
harbor.
unknown
speaker
whereabouts,
ms.
ludtke?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i'm
looking...
that's
what
we're
reading
from,
and
it
says
middle
of
the
harbor.
paragraph
four.
the
terms
middle
of
the
river
and
middle
of
the
harbor.
now,
certainly
middle
of
the
harbor
was
essential
to
drawing
a
line
outward
into
the
lobster
beds.
do
you
think
middle
of
the
harbor
means
something
different
from
middle
of
the
river?
unknown
speaker
and
it
means...
it
means
the
navi--
unknown
speaker
--the
regular
channel
of
navigation
through
the
harbor,
and
you
think
that
middle
of
the
river
does
not
mean
the
regular
channel
of
navigation
through
the
river.
that's
rather
odd
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
we're
just
focusing
on
number
four
for
a
minute...
it
says
the
terms
middle
of
the
river
as
used
in
the
above
quarter
mean
that
i'll
interpolate
(a)
the
middle
of
the
main
channel
of
navigation
of
the
piscataqua
river,
and
(b)
the
middle
of
the
main
channel
of
navigation
of
gosport
harbor.
so
those
are...
those
are
conjunctive
phrases
each
having
their
own
meaning,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
paragraph
five
of
that
decree
means
exactly
as
if
it
were
written...
that
blue
line.
unknown
speaker
so
seavey
island...
that's
the
part.
unknown
speaker
and
you
want
part
of
that.
unknown
speaker
why
shouldn't
the
1740
decree
be
relevant
to
part
of
the
dispute
and
not
another
part
of
the
dispute?
unknown
speaker
and
what
language
places
it
on
the
maine
shore?
i
mean,
i
can
understand
you're
saying
middle
of
the
river
means
you
follow...
you
follow
the
main
channel
of
the
river
and
not
one
of
the
side
channels,
but
what
portion
of
that
1740
decree...
unless
it's
a
terribly
sloppy
piece
of
work...
what
portion
of
it
says
when
you
follow
the
main
channel
you
use
the
maine
shore?
the
first
one
is
m-a-i-n,
and
the
second
is
m-a-i-n-e.
i
thought
that
was
clear.
unknown
speaker
but
they
would
have
said
something
about
it.
where
in
the
1740
order
do
they
refer
to
the
maine...
with
an
e...
shore?
i
don't
see
anything
there
that
refers
to
the
maine
shore.
unknown
speaker
i
wish
you...
yes.
unknown
speaker
are
there
two
harbors
here,
by
the
way?
she
said
there
is
gosport
harbor
and
another
harbor.
what
are
the
two
harbors?
unknown
speaker
oh,
out
by
the...
okay.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
okay.
