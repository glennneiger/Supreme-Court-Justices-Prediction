would
you
speak
up
a
little
please?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
maybe
you
can
raise
the
podium
and
everything
closer.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
1977
consent
decree
i
thought
had
to
do
with
the
lateral
marine
boundary
from
a
point
going
out
to
sea.
and
i
did
not
think
that
it
dealt
actually
with
the
upriver
area
at
all
and
the
islands
where
the
naval
base
is
now.
am
i
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
the
question
might
then
become
whether
it
follows
the
salvaig
or
it
doesn't,
and
whether
the
'77
consent
decree
has
res
judicata
effect
here.
it
may
not
in
relation
to
this
island
where
the
naval
base
is.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
the
point
is
that
i
at
least
looked
at
new
hampshire's
complaint
here
as
resting
on
an
allegation
that
the
division
is
the
low-water
mark
of
the
maine
shore.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with...
and
doesn't
require
us
to
determine
whether
we
follow
the
thaw
wick
or
the
geographic
middle
of
the
river
if
we
apply
the
old
king's
decree.
but
you
could
deal
with
your
motion
and
say,
sure,
if
we
dismiss
it
because
at
least
it
isn't
that
the
low-water
mark
of
the
maine
shore,
and
not
decide
whether
it
meets
the
thaw
wick
or
the
geographic
middle
of
the
river.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
could
do
that,
and
that
would
mean
they
could
come
back
here
a
fourth
time,
i
assume.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
at
the
very
least
it
didn't
mean
the
low-water
mark
on
the
maine
shore,
did
it?
i
mean,
no
matter
what
you
had
in
mind,
it
was
some
version
of
the
middle
of
the
river.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
excuse
me,
i
just...
i
don't
think
i
had
an
answer
to
my
question.
how
could
the
term
the
middle
of
the
river,
which
you've
agreed
to,
mean
the
low-water
mark
on
the
maine
shore?
