mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
submits
that
maine's
current
suit
is
barred
by
this
court's
1976
decision
and
its
1977
decree
in
new
hampshire
v.
maine,
no.
64,
original.
and
we
think
to
understand
64
original,
it
is
useful
to
look
at
a
map
here.
nh
has
provided
a
lodging
of
maps,
and
i
would
refer
you
if
you
have
a
copy
to
map
four,
which
shows
the
consent
decree
line.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
this
is
in
the
eight
and
a
half
by
eleven
document
entitled
new
hampshire's
map
lodging
for
oral
argument.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
okay,
perhaps
i
can
describe
the
line
and
that
might
be
helpful
to
understand
the
operation
of
the
consent
decree
in
1977.
this
consent
decree
did
provide
for
descriptions
of
the
lateral
marine
boundary
which
runds
perpendicular
to
what
would
be
the
coastline
of
maine
and
nh.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it's
map
number
four.
it's
f4.
in
any
event,
the
line
that
is
drawn
here
includes
the
lateral
marine
boundaries.
but
by
terms
of
the
consent
decree,
it
also
extended
the
line
up
into
the
harbor
this
is
the
line
that
runs
almost
north/south
that
is
marked
here.
that
is...
that
line
is
described
in
paragraph
five
of
the
consent
decree.
you
notice
it's
a
straight
line...
and
the
reason
why
it's
a
straight
line
is
it
follows
a
range
of
light
that
mariners
use
to
navigate
up
the
channel,
and
that's
why
we
call
this
the
main
channel
of
navigation.
and
you'll
see
it
ends
at
a
point
where
there
is
another
line
that
crosses
perpendicular
almost
east/west.
that's
another
set
of
range
lights
where
people
who
are
navigating
would
follow
as
well,
going
further
up
the
river.
but
the
important
point
to
recognize
with
regard
to
the
consent
decree
is
that
it
did
define
the
channel
as
the
middle
of
the
river...
as
the
middle
of
the
main
channel
of
navigation...
and
it
extended
that
line
up
into
the
river
to
a
considerable
degree.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
in
actuality
it
is
the
channel
that
is
in
fact
used
by
the
ships.
as
justice
white
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
in
no.
64
original,
the
talveig
would
normally
follow
the
deepest
channel
or
where
the
current
is
fastest,
so
it
would
not
necessarily
be
a
straight
line.
but
by
the
terms
of
the
consent
decree,
and
as
the
lines
are
drawn
shown
here,
they
compromise
their
meaning
of
the
1740
order
by
using
where
the
ships
actually
travel--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--seavey's
island
is
to
the
left...
to
the
west
of
this
line.
and
if
one
were
to
draw
the
line
consistently
with
the
'64
decree...
one
would
travel
east/west
along
those
range
lights...
they're
very
faintly
marked,
it
will
begin
actually
at
pierce's
island
which
is
not
marked
here,
but
up
north
you
see
seavey
island.
the
important
point
pertinent
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
is
under
any
interpretation
of
the
1740
decree
we
think
that
nh's
complaint
must
be
dismissed.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
maine
was
making
that
argument,
and
it
wasn't
ultimately
resolved.
of
course,
the
master
disagrees
with
the
consent
judgment
that
was
proposed
on
the
basis
that
it
should
have
been
the
geographic
middle,
and
this
court
rejected
that
argument.
now,
the
court
made
two
legal
rulings
and--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no,
rather
what
the
court
said
in
its
1976
decision
was
first
that
it's
clear
that
the
1740
order
of
the
king
controls
here,
and
it's
the
middle
of
the
river.
second,
the
parties
are
entitled
to
compromise
their
claim
because
this
is
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
decree...
not
perhaps
the
only
interpretation
of
the
1740
decree,
but
one
that
was
permissible.
i
don't
think
the
court
wants
to
go
back
and--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no,
i
think
what
the
court
was
suggesting
is
they
could
have...
that
decree
could
reasonably
describe
what
was
the
main
channel
of
navigation,
however
that
was
determined
at
that
time.
and
of
course
boundaries
are
ambulatory...
they
move,
and
maybe
the
main
channel
of
navigation
is
followed
differently
then
as
now.
but
for
purposes
of
resolving
this
dispute,
the
court
accepted
the
parties'
agreement
that
the
range
light
line
would
be
used
to
determine
the
main
channel
of
navigation
as
it
is
settled.
we
think
that
the
court's
consent
decree
does
preclude
further
litigation,
at
least
to
the
extent
that
certainly
the
middle
of
the
river
is
not
on
the
low-water
mark.
furthermore,
we
would
argue
that
the
main
channel
of
navigation
should
be
continued
to
be
used
to
continue
up
the
river.
to
do
otherwise
would
provide
a
discontinuous
line,
and
we
do
think
the
1740
order
of
the
king
ought
to
be
interpreted
in
one
way
as
we
go
from
the
mouth
of
the
harbor
up
the
river.
any
other
interpretatoin
will
lead
to
discontinuous
lines
the
court
will
have
to
connect.
nh
suggests
that's
all
right;
you
simply
use
your
equitable
powers.
we
suggest
that
the
better
approach
here
is
to
read
the
consent
decree
as
reasonably
determining
that
the
king's
order
would
have
one
meaning
for
purposes
of
the
1740
order,
and
it
should
be
applies
consistently
throughout
the
length
of
the
river.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
rely
on
issue
preclusion.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
the
court
did
adjudicate
the
question
of
whether
the
1740
order
controls.
they
found
it
necessary
to
reach
that
issue
in
order
to
enter
the
consent
decree.
as
to
the
line
that
was
drawn,
this
court
noted
in
arizona
v.
california,
and
it
noted
in
united
states
first
international
building
company
that
if
questions
of
law
in
fact
are
resolved
in
a
consent
judgment,
those
can
be
binding
on
the
parties.
we
think
it
is
reasonable
to
read
this
consent
judgment
providing
a
single
interpretation
of
middle
of
the
river,
it
would
apply
henceforth
to
all
applications
of
the
1740
decree.
after
all,
this
decree
only
effects
these
two
states;
it
is
reaosonable
for
them
to
conclude
when
they
drew
the
boundaries
that
they
were
looking
at
one
definition.
in
fact,
the
text
of
the
order
suggests
of
them...
the
1977
decree
suggests
that
as
well.
it
says
what
the
word
middle
of
the
river
means,
not
what
it
is
meant
to
or
what
it
is
deemed
to
mean
for
purposes
of
this
case
only.
if
the
parties...
the
parties
were
well
represented.
if
the
parties
had
intended
that
this
case
was
only
good...
that
this
ruling
was
only
good
for
this
stretch
of
the
river,
they
wuld
have
clearly
indicated
that
by
the
terms
of
the
consent
decree
and
they
would
have
put
the
court
on
notice
that
that's
exactly
what
was
determined.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes?
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
they're
going
moving
from
south...
from
north
to
south.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
right.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
the
reason
that
they
say
in
the
vicinity
is
they
start
that
point
with
the
two
range
lights
intersected.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
now,
the
current
charts...
if
the
court
is
interested
in
looking
at
the
current
charts,
they're
noaa
charts
13278
and
13283.
i
think
you'll
find
there's
some
difficulty
sometimes
in
finding
these
charts,
and
i
wanted
to
provide
you
with
those
numbers
in
case
you
have
the
inclination
to
look
further
at
the
charts
that
are
involved
here.
if
there
are
no
further
questions?
