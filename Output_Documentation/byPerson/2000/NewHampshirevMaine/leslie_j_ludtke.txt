ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
start
by
framing
what
appears
to
be
the
central
issue
before
the
court,
and
that
issue
is
as
follows:
maine
and
the
united
states
argue
that
nh
is
bound
by
its
position
in
the
1976
case
concerning
the
meaning
of
the
1740
boundary
decree.
that
case
involved
the
determination
of
the
state's
lateral
marine
boundary
that
ran
between
the
mouths
of
pourtsmouth
harbor
and
gosport
harbor.
now
the
boundary
decree
in
question
which
was
issued
as
an
order
to
counsel
in
1740,
describes
the
boundary
as
follows,
and
i
will
paraphrase
the
description:
the
boundary
passes
up
through
the
mouth
of
piscataqua
harbor
and
up
the
middle
of
the
river
into
the
river
newichwannock
and
through
the
same
to
the
furthest
head
and
it
divides
the
isles
of
shoals.
in
1976
maine
and
new
hampshire
agreed
that
three
phrases
in
the
1740
decree
had
relevance
in
determining
the
location
of
their
lateral
marine
boundary,
and
those
phrases
were
as
follows:
phrase
number
one:
the
boundary
passes
up
through
the
mouth
of
the
harbor;
phrase
two:
it
passes
up
the
middle
of
the
river;
and
phrase
three,
it
divides
the
isles
of
shoals.
since
that
time,
nh
has
determined
for
good
historical
reasons
after
a
searching
review
of
original
records
and
maps
that
the
phrase
up
the
middle
of
the
river
has
no
relevance
to
determining
the
location
of
the
boundary
in
the
harbor
and
the
tidal
portions
of
the
piscataqua
river.
maine
and
the
united
states
claim
that
the
stipulation
in
1976
preludes
nh
from
arguing
in
this
case
that
that
phrase,
up
the
middle
of
the
river,
had
no
application
to
the
location
of
the
boundary
in
portsmouth
harbor.
nh
contends
that
it
is
precluded
from
arguing
that,
because
that
phrase...
up
the
middle
of
the
river...
was
not
essential
to
this
court's
jurisdictions
to
enter
judgment
approving
the
consent
decree.
we
say
that
it
wasn't
essential
to
the
court's
jurisdiction
and
we
say
that
if
anything,
it
impeded
the
court's
ability
to
enter
that
order.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
excuse
me.
i
meant
that
it's
our
position
in
this
litigation
that
that
phrase
and
the
parties'
stipulation
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
up
the
middle
of
the
river
in
1976
impeded
this
court's
ability
to
enter
a
consent
decree.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
your
honor,
the
consent
decree
did
not
address
the
phrase
middle
of
the
harbor,
nor
did
it
address
the
phrase
mouth
of
the
harbor.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
i
understand
that.
i'm
referring
to
the
consent
decree
that
was
entered
by
the
parties
where
the
parties
did
not
address
the
meaning
of
those
terms.
the
consent
decree
entered
by
the
parties
defined
only
the
term
middle
of
the
river,
and
the
parties
defined
the
term
middle
of
the
river
in
that
consent
decree
as
meaning
the
1956
ship
range
light
channel--
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
--this
court
entered
an
order
approving
the
consent
decree.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
the
parties'
consent
decree
appears
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief
for
the
united
states,
and
the
paragraph--
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
--excuse
me,
at
1(a)
in--
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
--that
means
the
middle
of
gosport
harbor,
your
honor.
the
boundary
lines
are
lateral--
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
--boundary
lines
go
through
the
middle
of
gosport.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
your
honor,
nh
has
very
carefully
reviewed
the
historical
documents
pertaining
to
the
1740
order
and
the
way
in
which
that
language
was
used
in
that
1740
order.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
that's
correct.
the
term
middle
of
the
river
refers
to
the
main
channel
of
navigation
in
the
piscataqua
river,
which
is
then
defined
by
the
ships'
range
light
line.
the
term
middle
of
the
harbor
means
the
middle
of
the
main
channel
of
navigation
through
gosport
harbor,
which
is
in
the
isle
of
shoals.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
your
honor,
the
state
of
nh
is
not
contesting
the
lateral
marine
boundary
in
the
portion...
i
call
it
the
dogleg
portion...
that
runs
up
toward
pepperrell
cove,
and
that
is
the
line
that
is
referred
to
that
is
marked
by
the
1956
ships'
range
line,
and
that
line,
by
definition,
terminates
at
the
location
of
the
ships'
range
light
lines
which
are
located
on
pepperrell
cove.
it
is
not
a
continuous
line.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
looking
at
map
four,
the
line
that
proceeds
from
here
to
here,
the
top
towards
pepperrell
cove,
the
turn,
represents
the
1956
ships'
range
light
line--
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
--determined
by
that.
it
terminates--
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
--that's
correct.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
and
it
terminates
by
definition
at
the
shore
right
here.
we
supply
the
united
states
coast
and
geodetic
map.
it
terminates
by
definition
at
the
shore,
which
is
the
location
of
a
ship
range
light.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
pardon?
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
the
portion
of
the
boundary
that
is
at
issue
in
this
litigation
is
the
portion
that
starts
from
this
line
west
of
this
line,
and
runs
up
the
river
to
the
saltwater
confluence
at
the
puchico
river.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
this
is
seavey's
island
right
here.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
this
case
is
not
about
the
location
of
the
portsmouth
naval
shipyard...
it's
about
the
boundaries
of
nh,
and
it's
about
whether
nh
has
rights
to
portsmouth
harbor
that
historically
have
been
nh's.
our
case
goes
back
to
1679
when
nh
was
created
as
royal
province
and
the
port
of
piscataqua...
later
the
port
of
new
hampshire...
was
annexed
to
new
hampshire.
we
historically
have
controlled
and
governed
the
harbor;
our
claim
goes
to
the
fact
that
the
historical
documents
show
that
at
the
time
of
the
american
revolution--
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
l
in
1976
the
parties
had
no
motive
or
reasons
to
litigate
these
issues.
the
key
matter
at
issue
in
the
1976
litigation
concerned
nh's
desire
for
a
straight
line
lateral
marine
boundary.
and
there
have
been
a
number
of
maps
filed
that
shows
the
respective
claims
of
the
parties,
and
i'll
refer
you
specifically
to
map
number
eleven
which
shows
all
the
different
boundary
claims.
and
people
had
a
lot
of
different
ideas
about
where
the
boundaries
should
be
in
the
lateral
marine
area.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
location
of
the
starting
point
was
intended
to
achieve
one
purpose
as
far
as
nh
was
concerned,
and
that
was
to
accomplish
a
straight
line
lateral
marine
boundary.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
no,
your
honor.
nh
is
not
bound
by
that
because
there
was
no
actual
adjudication
of
the
issues
in
1976.
no
inference
can
be
raised
that
the
parties
intended
to
adjudicate
that,
and
i
will
address
that
specifically
with
respect
to
the
continuity
argument.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
question
on
whether
there
was
an
actual
decision
goes
to
the
matter
of
whether
that
stipulation
was
essential
to
the
court's
authority
to
enter
the
decree.
and
the
court
could
have
entered
the
decree
as
a
valid
agreement
of
the
parties
establishing
the
location
of
the
boundary
simply
by
reference
to
the
phrase
in
the
1740
decree
that
describes
the
boundary
as
passing
up
through
the
mouth
of
piscataqua
harbor.
the
point
that
i
attempted
to
make
before
is
that
if
anything,
that
was
an
impediment.
the
court
entered
the
decree
despite
that,
not
because
of
it,
and
the
reason
is
is
because
therre
is
no
legal
authority
for
using
a
modern
ships
channel
as
a
divisional
principle
in
boundary
cases.
there
are
a
number
of
boundary
cases
that
do
use
ship
channels,
but
the
ships'
channel
is
always--
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
--pardon?
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
and
that's...
that's
why
i
think
that
the
1976
order
issued
by
this
court
does
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
states
have
broad
latitude
in
coming
to
agreement
as
to
the
lcoation
of
a
boundary
when
the
underlying
boundary
instrument
is
imprecise,
and
i
think
the
second
correlary
of
that
is
this
court
need
not
adjudicate
the
actual
true
and
correct
historical
meaning
of
the
underlying
decree
in
approving
such
an
agreement
of
the
parties.
i
think
later
on
in
the
multi-state
tax
commission
that
we
cited
in
our
brief,
in
that
case
the
court
explicitly
cited
this
case
as
well
as
the
virginia
v.
tennessee
case
for
the
proposition
that
an
approval
of
an
agreement
relative
to
a
boundary
line
didn't
implicate
the
commerce
clause
when
the
underlying
instrument
was
imprecise.
so
i
think
it
goes
to
the
point
of
whether
this
court
could
ahve
approved
that
consent
agreement
entered
into
between
new
hampshire
and
maine,
had
that
stipulation
not
been
there,
regarding
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
middle
of
the
river.
and
the
answer
to
that
has
to
be
yes,
and
particularly
for
the
reasons
you
state
regarding
the
dissent
that
was
raised,
because
there
is
no
legal
or
historical
authority
for
defining
the
term
middle
of
the
river
as
it
was
used
in
1740
to
mean
a
ships'
channel
marked
by
1956
range
lights
that
clearly
was
not
located
at
the
location
of
the
solweig.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
well,
the
consent
decree
that
was
approved
stated
specifically
in
the
first
paragraph
that
the
master's
decision
is
approved,
and
the
master's
recommendation
provided
for
a
line
at
the
geographic
middle.
then
the
dissent
raised
questions
that
it
was
not
the
solweig...
no
representation
was
made
that
it
was
the
solweig...
that
it
was
a
1956
ship
channel
that
was
being
used,
and
raised
questions
about
the
legal
authority
of
those
devices
to
determine
a
1740
boundary.
nh
at
oral
argument
told
the
court
this
decision
is
arbitrary.
it's
based
on
administrative
convenience...
we
want
a
straight
boundary
line.
and
the
reason
why
that
dogleg
went
up
into
the
harbor
instead
of
emerged
from
a
closing
line
is
that
maine
insisted
at
that
time
that
a
closing
line
not
be
placed
across
the
harbor
so
that
it
could
take
advantage
of
the
reservation
that
this
court
had
allowed
it
in
the
united
states
v.
maine
case
to
litigate
the
legal
extent
of
its
seaward
boundaries.
so
this
was
not
a
case
where
the
parties
intended
to
negotiate
or
to
conclude
a
boundary
in
the
harbor;
the
dogleg
portion
of
it
was
done
to
accommodate
maine's
interests
in
reserving
its
right
to
litigate
the
question
of
the
legal
extent
of
its
seaward
boundaries.
moreover,
as
the
state
has
submmitted
to
the
court,
the
solicitor
general
at
that
time
was
expressing
grave
concerns
regarding
the
question
of
whether
this
would
implicate
rights
in
the
united
states
v.
maine
case
by
establishing
a
ruling
that
colonial
charters
had
a
legal
effect
in
determining
boundaries
in
the
marginal
sea.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
that's
absolutely
correct.
the
claim
is
a
very
different
claim--
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
--as
stated
in
the
complaint,
the
claim
was
for
the
lateral
marine
boundaries
that
ran
from
the
mouth--
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
--there
is
no
line...
that
is
a
natural
outgrowth
of
the
line
that
terminates
at
the
lights.
those
range
lights
were
installed
in
order
to
allow
vessels
to
navigate
up
through
that
particular
area.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
well,
there
are
actually
some
range
lights
at
pierce's
island,
but
those
range
lights
weren't
even
discussed
in
the
context
of
the
1976
case.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
your
honor,
i
would
disagree
with
that
based
on
the
oral
argument
when
nh
represented
it
to
the
court
that
that
was
an
arbitrary
location
based
on
the
administrative
convenience
of
the
parties.
moreover,
it
does--
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
--nh
in
the
oral
arguments
that
those
locations
were
arbitrary
and
based
on
the
desire
for
the
administrative
convenience
of
their
respective
states.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
your
honor,
maine
did
not
take
the
position
at
this
time
that
this
was
a
litigated
issue
or
that
this
was
an
issue
that
actually
was
tied
to
the
historical
location
of
the
ship's
channel--
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
--your
honor--
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
--your
honor,
the
history
of
the
litigation
shows
that
at
the
time
that
maine
and
nh
entered
into
this
decree,
which
was
1974,
both
states
did
it
with
the
best
of
intentions.
there
was
not
a
searching
historical
inquiry
into
what
the
phrase
up
the
middle
of
the
river
might
have
meant.
both
states
did
it
with
the
best
intentions
without
a
thorough
inquiry
into
what
the
history
was.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
your
honor,
i
think
the
question
goes
to
the
applicability
of
that
phrase
to
describe
the
harbor
boundary.
at
that
time
the
both
maine
and
nh
believed
with
the
best
of
intentions
and
the
best
of
understanding
that
that
phrase
applied
to
the
harbor
boundary.
we
have
since
changed--
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
--your
honor,
our
position
on
the
term
up
the
middle
of
the
river
means
that...
we
take
the
position
that
as
historically
used
that
was
intended
to
describe
the
course
of
the
boundary
up
the
main
part
of
the
piscataqua
river,
and
it
was
intended
to
direct
that
the
line
that
proceeded
north
two
degrees
west
went
from
the
main
tributary
that
was
that
the
main
feeder
stream
into
the
headwaters
of
the
salmon
falls
river,
and
we
have
shown
through
the
1763
boundary
proceedings
and
the
1828
boundary
proceedings
that
that
is
how
that
term
was
used.
we
do
not
think
that
that
term
is
properly
applied
to
the
harbor
boundary.
in
1973,
both
maine
and
nh
and
a
special
master
all
thought
that
term
had
some
relevance
to
the
harbor
boundary,
with
the
best
of
intentions,
because
there
had
not
been
a
searching
historical
inquiry
into
what
that
language
meant,
and
it
was
an
easy
mistake
to
make.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
the
nh--
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
--no,
your
honor.
but
that's
not
what
they
knew,
and
they
did
it
with
the
best
of
intentions.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
your
honor,
we're
not
trying
to
get
out
of
anything
that
was
decided
in
1976.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
your
honor,
the
issue
wasn't
actually
adjudicated.
the
applicability
of
this
phrase
was
an
assumption
that
the
parties
brought
to
the
negotiations,
and
the
boundary
was
set
out
based
upon
those
negotiations.
there
was
no
actual
intent...
no
actual
adjudication
of
whether
this
phrase
applied.
the
portion
of
the
boundary
at
issue
was
not
the
harbor
boundary.
there
is
no
intent
to
make
this
apply...
that
was
clear.
and
i
think
that
the
most
troublesome
aspect...
and
that's
why
i
addressed
this
question
first...
is
whether
this
court
could
have
entered
throught
a
consent
decree
in
1976
had
the
parties'
stipulations
pertaining
to
the
meaning
of
the
middle
of
the
river
not
been
there.
i
think
the
court
could
have
entered
it,
because
the
boundary
description
describes
the
boundary
as
passing
up
through
the
mouth
of
piscataqua
harbor,
and
it
would
have
been
reasonable,
given
that
description
of
the
boundary,
for
the
parties
to
agree
upon
a
locatoin
in
the
middle.
but
the
point
is
that
neither
the
application
nor
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
up
the
middle
of
the
river
was
actually
adjudicated
in
1976.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
the
1740
decree
is
a
relevant
piece
of
historical
evidence.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
no,
we've
actually
stated
it
is
relevant
to
when
we've
listed
the
items
that
we
believe
fair
on
nh's
boundary
claim,
and
that's
on
page
twelve
of
our
motion
and
our
brief.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
decree
can
be
read
in
that
way
becuase
therre
was
no
adjudication
of
the
issues.
the
claims
are
very
different
in
this
case.
no
intent
can
be
inferred,
and
it
was
not
essential
to
this
court's
jurisdiction
to
enter
judgment.
and
i
think
that's
been
made
clear
by
the
court's
citation--
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
--the
1740
decree
describes
the
boundary
as
passing
up
through
the
mouth
of
the
harbor,
and
we
believe
that
is
relevant.
but
what
we
think
is
more
relevant
is
the
historical
evidence.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
it
doesn't
say
the
middle
of
the
harbor.
it
says
it
shall
pass
up
through
the
mouth
of
the
piscataqua
harbor
and
up
the
middle
of
the
river.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
dividing
line
is
not
what's
at
issue
here.
what's
at
issue
is
the
phrase
passing
up
through
the
mouth
of
piscataqua
harbor,
and
nh
has
made
a
claim
based
upon
its
right
as
a
successor
sovereign
to
the
crown
at
the
revolution
when
the
province
of
nh's
boundaries
extended
to
the
maine
shore.
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
no,
your
honor.
middle
of
the
harbor
refers
to
gosport
harbor
and,
in
fact,
there
is
a
distinction
there
because
the
decree
says
specifically
that
it
passes
through
the
middle
of
gosport
harbor
whereas
it
only
says
it
passes
through
the
mouth
of
piscataqua
harbor
which,
at
that
time,
was
annexed
entirely
to
the
province
of
nh
governed
and
controlled
and
administered
by
nh
provincial
officials.

ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
--we
think
that
the
1740
order
needs
to
be
reconciled
with
history.
we
don't
think
that
the
apparent
meeting
of
the
text
can
trump
history.
what
we
have
done
is
look
at
history
and
try
to
understand
the
text
of
that
order
in
a
context
of
history,
and
that
has
been
the
reason
for
our
great
reliance
on
historical
events
and
documents
in
explaining
what
the
terms
of
that
1740
order--
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
--yes,
and
we
say
those
words
are
entirely
consistent
with
the
boundary
located
on
the
maine
shore,
becuase
those
words
were
intended
to
direct
that
the
boundary
follow
the
maine
part.
and
we
have
cited
the
charter
and
are

leslie

ludtke
--the
boundary
decree
describes
the
boundary
as
passing
up
through
the
mouth
of
piscataqua
harbor,
and
nh
has
shown
through
historical
evidence
the
the
harbor
was
annexed
to
nh,
and
that
the
boundary
commissioners
had
no
authority
to
divide
the
harbor.

ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
--your
honor,
may
i
make
an
answer?
ms.
leslie
j.
ludtke
the
boundary
decree,
although
it
says
passes
up
through
the
mouth
of
the
harbor
has
to
be
construed
in
the
context
of
the
authority
of
the
boundary
commissioners,
the
authority
of
the
treasury
over
ports,
the
authority
of
the
king
to
withhold
navigable
rivers
and
ports
from
royal
provinces
without
charters--
