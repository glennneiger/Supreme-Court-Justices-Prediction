but
to
do
that
we
would
just
as
much
have
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
only
thing
which
the
1977
decree
technically
held...
mainly
the
outward
line...
depended
upon
a
calculation
of
what
the
line
within
the
river
was.
we
still
have
to
make
that
conclusion.
and
while
we're
making
that
conclusion,
we
may
as
well
go
the
whole
hog
and
accept
what
that
decree
said
was,
which
was
mainly
the
middle
of
the
channel
of
navigation
rather
than
the
geographic
middle.
isn't
that
logical?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
the
other
approach
is
illogical.
i
mean,
there's
no
basis
for
saying
that
we
can
resolve
this
matter
without
deciding
where
it
is
in
the
river,
because
the
only
thing
the
decree
says
is
that
the
line
outward
into
the
ocean
depends
upon
the
line
inward
in
the
harbor
and
in
the
river,
and
it
then
goes
on
to
say,
and
that
line
is
the
middle
of
the
navigation
channel,
so
it
seems
to
me
if
we
buy
into
the
binding
effects
of
the
decree,
we
buy
into
the
middle
of
the
navigation
channel.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
the
court
would
be
surprised
to
learn
that
the
real
disagreement
between
the
majority
and
the
dissent
in
the
case
was
not
over
where
the
line
was,
but
rather
over
whether
you
can
accept
the
parties'
stipulation
or
not.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
writings
as
i
recall
it
that
that
was
the
difference
between
the
majority
and
the
dissent.
i
think
both
the
majority
and
the
dissent
understood
that
they
had
to
be
determining
what
the
line
was,
giving
some
allowance
to
the
parties'
concessions,
but
the
court
had
a
responsibility
to
determine
the
line.
both
things
seem
to
indicate
that,
and
you're
telling
us
that
the
basic
distinction
is
that
the
majority
just
thought
that
they
had
no
responsiblity
to
come
to
an
independent
determination.
i
just
don't
read
the
order
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
ludtke,
the
one
problem
with
what
you're
saying
is
that
it
just
doesn't...
doesn't
comport
with
what
is
said
in
the
consent
decree.
i
mean,
the
consent
decree
doesn't
say,
oh,
you
know,
let's
just
draw
the
line
here
arbitrarily...
we
have
to
draw
it
somewhere.
it
begins
by
setting
forth
the
order
of
the
king
and
council
of
april
9,
1740,
and
it
then
continues
as
used
in
that
order
of
the
king
and
council
the
term...
not
just
the
term
middle
of
the
harbor,
but
also
the
term
middle
of
the
river...
mean
the
middle
of
the
main
channel
of
navigation.
i
mean,
there's
just
no
other
way
to
read
the
consent
decree
except
as
addressing
that
precise
issue
and
not
coming
to
some
just
arbitrary...
not
based
on
the
1740
consent
decree
line
through
the
middle
of
the
harbor.
they
thought
that
they
were
doing...
being
faithful
to
the
order
of
the
king
and
council.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
was
that?
in
the
oral
presentation?
nh
said
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
you
shouldn't
lie
about
it.
if
you
think
it's
arbitrary,
you
shouldn't
sign
a
piece
of
paper
that
says
the
order
of
the
king
and
council
says
this,
and
what
that
order
means
is
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
simply
incompatible
with
getting
up
and
saying
the
line
is
arbitrary.
if
you
believed
it
was
arbitrary,
you
shouldn't
have
signed
this
is
seems
to
me,
and
i
think
we
can
hold
you
to
what
you
sign.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
said
the
middle
of
the
harbor,
precisely.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
the
dividing
line
shall
part
the
isles
of
shoals
and
run
through
the
middle
of
the
harbor
between
the
islands
to
the
sea
on
the
southerly
side.
justice
antonin
scalia
at
one
point
it
seems
to
me
it
does
say
just
passing...
where
is
it...
through
the
mouth
of
the
piscataqua
harbor.
but
then
later
when
it
refers
to
the
same
line
it
says
run
through
the
middle
of
the
harbor.
so
it
does
say
middle
of
the
harbor,
and
you're
essentially
arguing
that
the
middle
of
the
harbor
means
something
different
than
middle
of
the
river.
