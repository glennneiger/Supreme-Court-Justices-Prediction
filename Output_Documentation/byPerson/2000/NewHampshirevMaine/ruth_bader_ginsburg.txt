but
the
last
time
around
there
wasn't
any
actual
adjudication.
as
i
understand
it,
the
special
master
said
that
the
geological
line,
and
this
court
said,
no,
the
parties
have
agreed
on
what
middle
of
the
river
means,
but
it
was...
one
could
say
that
agreement
was
for
that
controversy,
and
then
all
bets
are
off...
they're
talking
about
a
different
portion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
first,
on
claim
preclusion,
it
isn't
the
same
claim
because
it
was
one
portion
that
was
in
content
to
be
'77
and
a
different
portion
now,
so
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be
claim
preclusion.
the
dispute
over
lobster
fishing
is
not
dealing
with
the
same
land
as
the
current
case,
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
difference
is
that
claim
preclusion
would
be
used
to
the
extent
that
it
doesn't
matter
what
was
actually
litigated
if
it's
a
part
of
the
whole
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
issue
preclusion,
it
usually
does
matter
whether
it
was
actually
litigated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
minear,
which
preclusion
principle
are
you
relying
on?
it
seems
to
me
it
doesn't
fit
claim
preclusion...
it
is
a
different
claim
that's
being
made
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
even
though
the
court
didn't
actually
adjudicate
anything,
it
accepted
the
parties'
submissions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
stop
you
there
just
for
a
moment,
because
i
want
to
be
clear
on
how
much
you
want
to
go
back.
i
understand
that
you
say
that
the
settlement
that
was
entered
into
in
'77
was
for
that
case
only.
you
have
answered
justice
kennedy
that
the
1740
order
is
relevant
evidence
but
not
conclusive.
are
you
attacking
that
1740
order
also
as
not
the
basis...
whatever
it
means?
are
you
saying
it
is
not
the
proper
basis
for
determining
this
boundary?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
it's
not
binding?
for
what
reason?
because
that
was
intended
to
be
a
settlement...
a
decision
by
the
king...
ultimately
by
the
king.
whatever
those
words
may
mean
that
are
set
out
in
2(a)...
isn't
that
at
least
conclusive
between
these
two
states?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
second
case
i
have
to
announce
is
new
hampshire
against
maine,
no.
130
original.
this
case
in
which
we
served
as
a
court
of
first
and
last
resort,
involves
a
boundary
dispute
between
new
hampshire
and
maine
that
originated
in
the
1700's.
at
the
southeastern
end
of
the
miane
new
hampshire
boarder,
the
eastern
most
point
of
new
hampshire
meets
the
southern
most
point
of
maine.
the
boundary
in
this
region
follows
the
piscataqua
river
eastward
into
portsmouth
harbor
from
there
it
extends
southeastwards
into
the
sea.
if
you
don’t
get
the
picture,
aid
is
at
hand
an
illustrative
map
is
appended
to
the
court's
opinion.
24
years
ago,
in
a
lobster
fishing
dispute
between
the
two
states
this
court
entered
a
consent
judgment
fixing
the
maine-new
hampshire
boundary
in
the
coastal
waters
from
portsmouth
harbor
five
miles
seaward
to
gosport
harbor
in
the
isle
of
shoals.
the
location
of
that
boundary
required
a
determination
of
where
in
portsmouth
harbor
the
boundary
should
end.
that
in
turn
required
a
determination
of
where
the
boundary
along
the
piscataqua
river
crosses
the
closing
line
of
portsmouth
harbor.
the
parties
agreed
and
we
held
that
it
is
positive
1740
decree
of
king
george
ii
fixed
the
piscataqua
river
boundary
at
the
middle
of
the
river
and
that
those
words
mean,
‘the
middle
of
the
river’s
main
channel
of
navigation’.
the
1977
consent
judgment
determined
only
the
maine-new
hampshire
boundary,
from
portsmouth
harbor
southeastward
into
the
sea.
it
did
not
fix
the
boundary
from
portsmouth
harbor
westward
up
the
piscataqua
river.
this
case
initiated
by
new
hampshire
last
term
concerns
the
boundary
along
the
inland
stretch
of
the
piscataqua
river
from
portsmouth
harbor
westward.
new
hampshire
now
claims
that
the
inland
river
boundary
runs
along
the
maine
shore
and
that
the
entire
river
and
all
of
portsmouth
harbor
belong
to
new
hampshire.
maine
has
moved
to
dismiss
the
case,
urging
that
earlier
proceedings
bar
new
hampshire’s
current
complaint.
in
today’s
decision
we
grant
maine’s
motion,
applying
a
doctrine
know
as
‘judicial
estoppel’
we
hold
that
new
hampshire
is
prohibited
from
maintaining
that
the
piscataqua
river
boundary
runs
along
the
maine
shore.
judicial
estoppel
is
a
doctrine
distinct
from
the
res
judicata
doctrines
of
claim
and
issue
preclusion.
its
object
is
to
stop
a
party
who
has
relied
on
an
argument
to
prevail
in
one
legal
proceeding
for
relying
on
a
conflicting
argument
to
prevail
in
another
legal
proceeding.
the
doctrine
aims
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
process.
several
practice
presented
here
combine
to
warrant
application
of
the
judicial
estoppel
doctrine.
first,
new
hampshire’s
current
reading
of
“middle
of
the
river"
conflicts
with
its
agreement
in
the
1970’s
litigation
that
those
words
mean
“either
the
middle
of
the
maine
navigable
channel
or
as
the
1970’s
special
master
had
suggested,
the
geographic
middle
of
the
river.
either
construction
located
at
the
middle
of
the
river,
somewhere
other
than
the
maine
shore.
second,
as
the
record
of
the
1970’s
case
shows
this
court
accepted
new
hampshire’s
agreement
with
maine,
that
middle
of
the
river
means
middle
of
the
maine
navigable
channel;
and
third,
new
hampshire
benefited
from
that
interpretation;
it
was
a
compromise
that
enabled
new
hampshire
to
settle
the
case
on
terms
beneficial
to
both
states.
new
hampshire
cannot
tenably
assert
that
the
1977
interpretation
of
‘middle
of
the
river’
to
which
it
subscribed
was
arbitrary
unemployment
or
inadvertent.
new
hampshire
had
ample
opportunity
prior
to
the
entry
of
the
1977
consent
decree
closely
to
examine
the
history
of
the
river
boundary
and
this
court
determined
that
the
interpretation
in
the
consent
decree
was
consistent
with
historical
evidence.
new
hampshire
now
tenders
additional
evidence
which
it
interprets
as
placing
piscataqua
river
boundary
along
the
maine
shore,
but
that
evidence
was
available
25
years
ago
and
new
hampshire
had
every
reason
to
consult
it
in
locating
whether
seaward
boundary
terminated
in
portsmouth
harbor.
new
hampshire
further
urges
that
its
status
as
a
“state”
shielded
from
judicial
estoppel,
that
might
be
so
where
new
hampshire
seeking
to
give
effect
to
a
duly
adopted
change
in
its
own
policies,
but
this
case
does
not
fit
that
bill,
rather
it
is
a
case
between
two
states
in
which
each
owes
the
other
a
full
measure
of
respect.
the
opinion
detailing
why
we
refuse
to
allow
new
hampshire
to
construed
‘middle
of
the
river’
differently
today
than
it
did
in
1977
is
joined
by
all
members
of
the
court
except
justice
souter
who
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
