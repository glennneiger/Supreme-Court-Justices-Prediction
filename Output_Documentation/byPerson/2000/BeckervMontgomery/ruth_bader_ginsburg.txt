the
first
case
is
becker
against
montgomery,
the
no.
00-6374.
in
the
federal
court
system
an
appeal
from
a
district
court,
the
trial
court
to
a
court
of
appeals
starts
with
the
filing
of
a
notice
of
appeal
in
the
district
court.
if
such
a
notice
is
timely
filed,
but
is
not
signed,
maybe
appeal
thereafter
be
perfected.
that
is
the
question
this
case
presents.
we
hold
that
for
want
of
a
signature
on
a
timely
notice
the
appeal
is
not
lost.
petitioner
dale
g.
becker
an
ohio
prisoner
instituted
a
pro
se
civil
rights
action
in
the
federal
district
court
contesting
conditions
of
his
confinement.
becker’s
complaint
was
dismissed
for
failure
to
state
of
claim
on
which
relief
could
be
prohibited
and
becker
sought
to
appeal.
using
a
government
printed
form,
becker
timely
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
that
contained
all
of
the
requested
information.
on
the
line
tagged
counsel
for
appellant
becker,
who
had
no
counsel
typed
but
did
not
hand
signed
his
own
name.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
docketed
becker’s
appeal
and
set
a
briefing
scheduled.
becker
filed
his
brief
more
than
two
weeks
in
advance
of
the
deadline.
he
hand
signed
both
the
cover
and
the
last
page.
some
six
months
later
on
its
own
motion
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
becker’s
appeal
for
want
of
a
handwritten
signature
on
his
appeal
notice.
becker
asked
for
reconsideration,
and
attached
to
his
request
a
new
signed
notice
of
appeal.
the
court
of
appeals
denied
the
request.
in
that
court’s
view,
the
absence
of
the
signature
on
the
original
notice
was
jurisdictional,
and
therefore,
incurable
outside
the
time
allowed
to
file
the
notice.
we
granted
review
and
now
reverse
the
sixth
circuit’s
judgment
dismissing
becker’s
appeal.
the
governing
federal
rules
direct
that
the
notice
of
appeal
like
other
papers
filed
in
district
court
shall
be
signed
by
counsel
or
if
a
party
is
unrepresented,
by
the
party
himself.
but
the
very
same
rule
that
requires
appeal
notices
to
be
signed,
instructs
that
any
signature
omission
maybe
corrected
promptly
after
being
called
to
the
attention
of
the
attorney
or
party.
becker
provided
just
what
the
rule
directs.
his
original
appeal
notice
was
timely
filed
and
adequate
in
other
respects.
by
promptly
correcting
the
signature
omission,
becker
secured
his
right
to
a
decision
on
the
merits
of
his
appeal.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
