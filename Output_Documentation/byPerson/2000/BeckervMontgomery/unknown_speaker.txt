unknown
speaker
i
should
know
this...
when
you
file
a
notice
of
appeal,
do
you
file
with
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
so
rule
11
applies
at
that
point?
unknown
speaker
if
i
were
on
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
thought
that
rule
11
requires
a
signature--
unknown
speaker
--and
i
was
a
little
fussy
about
it,
what
would
i
do?
just
under
rule
11
just
say,
well,
will
you
please
cure
this
non-jurisdictional
deficiency?
unknown
speaker
and
please
clean
up
your
act
a
little,
okay?
unknown
speaker
clean...
clean
it
up
within
thirty
days.
i
mean,
that's
the
problem.
you
do
have
a
remedy,
but
why
doesn't
the
remedy
have
to
have
been
applied
within
the
thirty-day
time
limit?
unknown
speaker
does
it
say
that...
it
says
you
have
to
establish
an
intent
to
appeal
within
thirty
days?
i
thought
it
said
that
you
had
to
file
within
thirty
days
a
notice
of
appeal
which
includes
a
signature,
which
i
take
to
mean
a
written
signature
in
normal
parts.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
how
good
law
smith
is.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
there
were
a
couple
of
cases
decided
back
in
the
1960s
that
really
stretch
the
language,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
i
wasn't
referring
to
smith.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sutton,
could
we
go
back
to
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy
about
rule
11...
isn't
the
answer
on
the
other
side
that
once
you
file
the
notice
of
appeal,
authority
over
the
case
passes
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals,
so
at
that
point,
up
until
the
notice
of
appeal,
you're
in
the
district
court.
once
you
file
that
notice,
you
are
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
rule
11
is
a
rule
directed
to
district
court
and
not
the
court
of
appeals.
so
the
cure
that
rule
11
provides,
at
least
so
the
argument
goes,
would
not
be
available
in
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
i
suppose
if
you
haven't
filed
a
proper
notice
of
appeal,
you're
still
in
the
district
court.
i
mean,
you
could
argue
it
the
other
way
that
if
indeed
a
signature
is
required
and
you
file
it
without
a
signature
in
the
court
of
appeals,
it
is
ineffective
and
so
the
case
remains
in
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
mr....
mr.
sutton,
the
federal
rule
of
appellate
procedure
3
does
say
that
a
pro
se
notice
of
appeal
is
considered
filed
on
behalf
of
the
signer--
unknown
speaker
--which
gives
some
indication
that
a
signature
is
expected.
unknown
speaker
what
page?
unknown
speaker
5(a).
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
let
me
interrupt
you
for
a
second
with
that
first
hypothetical,
you're
assuming
that
he
calls
a
person
up
and
he
says
he
is
represented,
but
then
everything
is
okay?
unknown
speaker
but
no
lawyer
signed
anything.
you
are
assuming
that
there
would
be
appeals
in
which
the
lawyer
signed
them...
filed
them
without
ever
signing
anything.
unknown
speaker
and
your
position
is
that
if
there's
an
unsigned
notice
of
appeal,
it
vests
jurisdiction
if
the
man
has
a
lawyer,
but
it
does
not
if
the
man
does
not
have
a
lawyer?
i
mean,
you're
saying--
unknown
speaker
--well,
maybe
the
answer
is
that
there
shouldn't
be
jurisdiction
in
either
case
if
nobody
signed
anything.
unknown
speaker
well,
while
you're
on
that,
i
know
you
want
to
read
number
4
which
says
if
you
make
a
mistake,
it's
a
stupid
mistake;
it
doesn't
count.
unknown
speaker
i
realize.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
that
says
that
at
the
top
of
page
6(a).
unknown
speaker
but
i
did
have
a
question
direct--
unknown
speaker
--i
mean,
just
while
you
were
on
the
jurisdictional
mysticism
of,
you
know,
whether
it
dissolves
or
where
the
jurisdiction
is,
as
i
read
this,
and
tell
me
if
this
is
correct
or
not,
whether
it
supports
you
or
not,
i
want
to
know
if
it
is
right.
as
i
read
it,
if
your
notice
complies
with
all
the
conditions
of
rule
4,
it
is
valid.
nowhere
in
that
does
it
say
that
you
actually
have
to
sign.
so
suppose
you
don't
sign
it?
it's
still
valid.
unknown
speaker
it
still
does
everything
the
thing
does,
but
under
rule
11
if
you
didn't
sign
it,
it
could
be
stricken.
it
doesn't
say
it
wasn't
valid;
it
says
specifically
what
you
do.
you
failed
to
sign
it;
therefore
the
valid
notice
would
be
stricken
if
somebody
discovers
it
wasn't
signed.
but
before
you
strike
it,
you
give
a
person
a
chance
to
sign
it.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so
all
this
jurisdictional
stuff
is
beside
the
point,
because
the
rules
are
fairly
clear
that
there
is
just...
even
if
it
isn't
signed,
it
acts
just
like
it
was
signed,
but
it
is
subject
to
being
stricken.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sutton,
let
me
go
back--
unknown
speaker
--that's
right.
mr.
sutton,
we
go
back
to
the
problem
that
you
and
discussed
before
in
relation
to
justice
breyer's
question.
the
argument
that
rule
11
is
out
of
it.
once
you
file
the
notice
of
appeal,
authority
passes
to
the
court
of
appeals;
therefore,
the
part
of
rule
11
that
says
you
can
hear
it
is
no
longer
operative
because
that
rule
is
directed
to
district
courts
and
not
court
of
appeals,
and
it
sets
the
argument.
unknown
speaker
but
in
the
real
world
i'm
wondering
how
this
mistake...
who
caught
it?
because
there
was
already
a
briefing
schedule
when
this
turned
up.
who
found
that
the
notice
of
appeal
hadn't
been
signed?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sutton...
oh,
excuse
me.
you
mentioned
the
multiple
appellants,
and
that
was
the
problem
of
one
person
filing
a
notice
of
appeal,
putting
down
a
lot
of
other
names,
and
you
didn't
know
whether
the
other
names
really
wanted
to
appeal.
how
is
that
situation
handled
today?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
the
rules
could
not
put
conditions
on
what
you
have
to
do
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
other
than
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
why
is
that?
what
is
the
authority
for
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
doesn't
shrink
the
jurisdiction.
you
mean
that
a
court
would
have,
must
under
the
statute
accept
a
notice
of
appeal
that
consists
of
somebody
coming
in
and
singing
it?
it's
not
even
in
writing?
i
mean,
surely...
surely
the
statute
envisions
that
the
court
is
going
to
set
forth
the
procedures
for
effecting
a
notice
of
appeal.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
the
simple
pro...
does
the
statute
say
it
has
to
be
in
writing?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
how...
why
not...
answer
the
implied
question
from
justice
gin...
can
a
court
say
the
notice
of
appeal
must
be
in
writing
and
have
it
jurisdictional?
unknown
speaker
i'm
interested
in
this
statute.
now,
what
is
that
statute?
unknown
speaker
2107.
unknown
speaker
i
know.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sutton,
do
you
think
if
somebody
said
would
you
please
sign
this
check
and
i
typed
my
name
on
it
that
i
would
have
signed
it?
unknown
speaker
is
pen
and
ink
it
a
term
you
have
coined
for
this
case?
unknown
speaker
although
you
do
say
that
the
bank
keeps
a
record
of
each
client's
signature,
by
which
you
mean
pen
and
ink,
right?
unknown
speaker
it's
just
that
the
argument
that
you
could
just
type
it
in,
rather
than
to
the
problem
with
multiple
parties
again.
the
one
appellant
can
just
type
in
the
names
of
a
lot
of
people
who
don't
want
to
appeal.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
not
just
saying
anything
about
pro
se...
just
someone
types
in
his
own
name
and
two
other
names
of
people
who
were
parties
in
the
district
court
but
who
haven't
signed
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sutton,
what
about
filing
by
e-e-mail?
do
you
think
that
would
be
okay?
unknown
speaker
on
notices
of
appeal?
unknown
speaker
they
don't
have
to
allow
it.
you're
telling
us
they
have
no
power
to
forbid
it.
unknown
speaker
under
the
statute,
i
mean,
that's
your
position
under
the
statute,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
the
congress
had
used
the
word
notice
of
appeal,
and
the
notice
of
appeal,
as
the
understanding
has
been,
means
a
document
that
says
notice
of
appeal,
and
i
hereby,
and
then
it
has
a
signature
which
you
sign
or
counsel
signs.
unknown
speaker
shouldn't--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
sutton,
you
reach
an
interesting
conclusion
if
you
put
together
the
first
and
the
second
parts
of
your
argument.
in
the
first
part
you
assume
that
a
signature
meant
a
written
signature
and
you
said,
well,
you
know,
if
it
isn't
written
but
so
long
as
your
name
is
there,
that's
good
enough...
it's
properly
filed.
in
the
second
part
of
your
argument
you're
now
assuming
that
signature
just
means
a
typewritten
signature,
so
i
assume
it
would
follow
that
if
you
left
that
out,
it
will
also
be
properly
filed.
so
i
could
file
a
sheet
of
paper
with
no
name
on
it
and
i've
filed
a
proper
appeal.
unknown
speaker
not
even
a
typewritten
name,
because
in
the
first
part
of
your
argument
you
say
you
don't
need
the
signature,
so
if
i
apply
that
to
your
second
part
of
the
argument...
we
have
appeals,
we
don't
know
who
has
appealed.
we
know
somebody
has
filed
a
notice
of
appeal,
but--
unknown
speaker
--not
even
a
name?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
need
a
name?
it
is
only
the
signature
requirement
that
says
you
need
the
name.
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
intent
includes
who...
who
intends.
that's
your
answer
to
these
questions.
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
you
have
a
multi-party
case,
and
no
signature
at
all
on
the
appeal?
that
doesn't
tell
you
who
is
appealing.
unknown
speaker
but
the
courts
made
up
those
forms,
no?
i
mean...
you
say
that,
you
know,
you
could
draft
your
own
form,
right--
unknown
speaker
--under
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
and
we're
exceeding...
we're
destroying
the
separation
of
powers
if
we
stick
to
that
form,
right?
unknown
speaker
except
that
when
you
sign
something,
you
give
your
own
individual
imprimatur
to
what
is
said
in
the
text
that
you're
signing,
and
to
simply
have
your
name
incorporated
in
the
text
that
you
have
indicated
no
approval
of,
i
think,
falls
short.
unknown
speaker
for
all
i
know,
they've
never
seen
it.
unknown
speaker
but
certainly
if
you're
not
judgment-proof,
you
don't
likely
undertake
an
appeal
because
you
can
be
assessed
for
costs
if
you
lose
it.
but
if
you
are
judgment-proof,
presuming
there's
no
real
harm,
you're
not
going
to
suffer
anything
if
you
do
appeal.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
that...
you
have
gone,
i
think,
a
lot
farther
than
you
need
to
go.
all
you
needed
to
do
was
just
say
the
signature
is
curable
after
the
thirty
days,
right?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
sutton.
mr.
baker,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
baker,
are
there
not
courts
where
something
like
this
would
come
into
the
clerk's
office,
the
signature
is
lacking,
the
clerk
would
say,
well,
it
was
filed
within
the
ninety
days,
so
we'll
send
it
back
with
the
letter,
very
much
as
this
court
does.
when
something
is
filed
in
this
court...
a
cert
petition
and
it
is
deficient
but
it
is
on
time...
our
clerk
will
send
it
back
for
the
deficiency
to
be
cured.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
should
that
be
so
if
the
intent
to
appeal
is
clear
from
the
face
of
what
was
filed?
we
have
spoken,
i
guess,
in
the
torres
case
that
the
touchstone
is
the
clear
intent
to
appeal,
and
if
the
document
is
clear
as
it
was
in
this
case,
who
the
appellant
is
and
that
it
was
timely
filed
and
so
on,
why
should
that
be
jurisdictional
and
not
correctable
later?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
no
clear
statutory
rule
requirement
that
it
be
signed.
unknown
speaker
there
is.
but
rule
11
says
that
you
have
to
sign
it,
so
if
it's
not
signed,
here's
what
we
do.
we
strike
it,
but
before
we
strike
it
we
give
the
person
a
chance
to
sign
it.
that's
what
it
says.
unknown
speaker
so
all
right,
all
right,
it
says
we
really,
really,
really
will
strike
it
unless
you
sign
it.
now,
i
think
that
that
is...
i
think
it
is
hard
given
that
to
say
that,
you
know,
it
will
go
through
this
jurisdictional
thing
or
anything.
i
take
it
the
problem
here
is
he
wasn't
given
a
chance
to
sign
it.
unknown
speaker
why?
i
mean,
why
do
you
draw
that
line?
unknown
speaker
if
the
one
is
incorporated,
why
isn't
the
other?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't...
isn't
it
authority
that
goes
to
the
satisfaction
of
a
form
and
manner
requirement?
sure
it
is.
unknown
speaker
it
says
it
must
be
signed,
and
if
it
isn't
signed,
you
have
to
sign
it
if
you
get
a
notice
from
the
court.
and
if
you
don't
do
that,
we
strike
it.
that's
what
it--
unknown
speaker
--well,
again,
that's...
that's
not...
that's
really
not
clear.
i
mean
the
one
thing
that
rule...
that
thing
does
is
to
say
that
the
widow
or
the
wife
and
the
child
can
come
along
without
signing
it,
i
mean,
we
know
that
when
they
made
that
change
in
rule
3,
what
they
wanted
to
do
is
enable
people
to
be
parties
who
hadn't
signed,
and
then
to
say,
well,
now,
that
instituted
for
the
first
time
a...
a
statement
in
the
rules
that
the
pro
se
litigant
must
sign
is
kind
of
a
backdoor
way
to
create
a
signing
requirement.
unknown
speaker
it
may
be
it
had
in
mind
torres
and
the
problem
of
the
person
other
than
the
one
who
files
the
notice,
adding
names.
so
that
i
think
that
the...
that
that
problem
of
the
multi-party
of
appeal
is
what
prompted...
prompted
the
change
in
the
rule.
unknown
speaker
maybe
they
thought
the
signature
requirement
was
there
but
non-jurisdictional.
i
mean,
take
a
look
at
rule
1...
it
says
when
these
rules
provide
for
filing
a
document
in
the
district
court,
the
procedure
must
comply
with
the
practice
of
the
district
court.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
file
a...
perhaps
a
rule
(1)(a)(2),
then
you
pick
up
all
of
rule
11
and
not
just
a
piece
of
it.
unknown
speaker
why
doesn't
that
mean
that
defects
can
be
cured
after
the
thirty
days,
just
as
it
does
in
this
court?
unknown
speaker
so
then
you
are
making
the
distinction
that...
that
mr.
sutton
suggested
you
were...
that
this
is
a
requirement...
the
signing
requirement...
this
jurisdictional
signing
requirement
applies
only
to
pro
se
litigants
and
not
to
litigants
with
counsel.
unknown
speaker
but
you
agree
that
it's...
that
it's
not
jurisdictional
with
regard
to...
to
an
attorney?
unknown
speaker
under
the
jurisdictional--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
baker,
one
of
the
problems
since
we're
dealing
with
a
pro
se
litigant,
gets
this
form
from
the
sixth
circuit,
and
it
doesn't
say,
as
the...
the
sample
attached
to
the
rules
do,
s
with
a
signature.
so
then
he
gets
a
document
from
a
court
that
doesn't
even
warn
him
that
a
signature
is
required,
and
then
he's
out
the
door
because
he...
he
did
everything
that
the...
that
the
document
he
got
from
the
court
called
for.
unknown
speaker
the
whole
problem
is
that
he
wasn't
given
an
opportunity.
the
sixth
circuit
said,
thirty
days
are
up,
no
signature,
that's
it.
nothing
else
is
relevant.
unknown
speaker
well,
again
it's
not
a
question
of
not
paying
attention;
it's
a
question
of
whether
it
can
be
cured,
whether
we
know
that
the
thirty
days
can't
be
cured
once
that
runs,
but
the...
the
question
is
whether
something
like
the
signature
shouldn't
be
curable,
when
everything
is
there,
his
name
is...
is
in
the
caption,
his
name
is
in
the
body
of
the
notice.
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
a
total
absence
of
the
name
any
place,
and
i
think...
if
i
understand
you
right,
mr.
baker,
you
are
asking
us
to
equate
the
lack
of
a
signature
with
the
total
absence
of
the
name
of
the
would-be
appellant
any
place
in
the
notice.
unknown
speaker
it
is
one
thing
to
say,
look,
you...
you
weren't
even
named
any
place
in
this
notice
within
the
thirty
days,
so
we're
not
going
to
let
you...
you
can't
become
an
appellant
after
as
opposed
to
yes,
you're
named
in
the
caption,
yes,
you're
named
in
the
body,
all
that's
lacking
is
the
signature.
that
we
can
let
you
do
after
the
thirty
days.
unknown
speaker
have
the
courts
of
appeals
which
you
say
have
applied
this
rule
since
1980,
have
they
applied
it
only
to
pro
se
filings,
or
do
they
apply
it
to--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
baker,
let
me
just
ask
you,
one
of
the
tough
things
about
your...
your
position,
of
course,
is
this
contrast
between
the
pro
se
litigant
and
the
represented
litigant,
and
your
response,
in
part,
is
that
while
there
are
disciplinary
sanctions
on
the
lawyer
who
doesn't...
who
actually
fails
to
sign
and
so
forth,
but
does
that...
is
that
really
a
complete
response
because
isn't
there
still
the
danger
that
a
representative...
a
represented
appellant
might
have
some
friend
who,
without
authority,
went
ahead
and
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
without
even
the
lawyer
knowing
about
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
thought...
i
thought
you
were
saying
even
if
the
lawyer
had
not
signed
it,
it
would
not
be
jurisdictional.
unknown
speaker
no,
a
represented...
my
hypothetical
is
a
represented
party
on
whose
behalf
a
typewritten
notice
of
appeal
is
filed
without
the
knowledge
of
either
the
lawyer
who
represents
him
or
the
man
himself...
the
man
or
woman
himself.
that's
not
a
jurisdictional
defect,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
there
isn't
this
distinction
between
representative
and
non-representative
parties.
unknown
speaker
but
am
i
correct
then...
maybe
i
don't
have
the
facts
right
in
my
mind.
assume
a
represented
party
who
has
a
lawyer...
a
paper
is
filed
which
purports
to
be
a
notice
of
appeal
on
behalf
of
that
person
and
not
signed
by
anybody.
is
that
a
jurisdictional
defect
or
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
even
though,
in
fact,
it
was
not
prepared
by
the
attorney?
unknown
speaker
okay.
i
would
like
to
take
just
a
minute
on
the
question
of
the...
whether
a
typed
name
can
constitute
a
signature.
i
think
that's
been
addressed
at
considerable
length
already.
my
first
point,
and
i
apologize
for
raising
it
at
this
stage,
is
there
is
a
question
whether
this
is
fairly
covered
by
the
question
presented,
but
the
court
drafted
a
question
presented
that
presumes
there
has
been
a
failure
to
sign
here.
it
did
so
after
the
petitioner
had
filed
a
petition
that
made
reference
to
some
of
the
cases
that
address
the
question
whether
a
signed
notice
of
appeal
could
be...
whether
a
signing
constituted
typing.
so
there
is
a
real
question
whether
the
court
in
framing
this
question
didn't
exclude
this
issue
or--
--you're
saying
we've
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
a
failure
to
sign.
unknown
speaker
mr.
baker,
is
there
anything
in
your
view
that
is
quote
jurisdictional,
other
than
the
one
thing
we
all
agree,
is
the
thirty
days
is
jurisdictional.
now
you
say
the
signing
requirement,
at
least
to
a
pro
se
litigant,
is.
is
there
anything
else
that
you
would
rank
as
jurisdictional
so
you
would
be
disqualified
as
an
appellant?
unknown
speaker
but
is
anything
other
than
naming
a
person
as
a
party
that
couldn't
be
cured
after
the
thirty
days
are
up,
and
some
of
the
other
things
that
you
mentioned?
unknown
speaker
i
know
that
the
torres
establishes
law,
but
i
don't
know
that
any
of
the
others
say
that
you
can't
cure
a
defect.
as
long
as
something
is
clearly
identifiable
as
a
notice
of
appeal,
what
is
it
that
says
that
errors
in
designating
the,
the
details,
are
incurable?
unknown
speaker
and
the
elements
are
who
is
appealing,
and
what
else?
unknown
speaker
yes.
and
all
of
that
is
in
this
notice...
who
is
appealing,
what
he's
appealing,
and
who
he's
appealing
to.
unknown
speaker
and
yet
there's
not
one
word
from
the
advisory
committee
that
suggests
this
is
quote
jurisdictional.
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
a
party
not
being
named
at
all.
unknown
speaker
mr.
baker,
you
served
as
an
amicus
for
the
court
in
this
case,
and
we
thank
you
for
your
services.
mr.
sutton,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
