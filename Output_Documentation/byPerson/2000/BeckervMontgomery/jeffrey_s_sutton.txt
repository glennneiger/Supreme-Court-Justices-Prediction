mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
arguments
that
i
would
like
to
press
this
morning.
the
first
is
that
a
timely
notice
of
appeal
may
never
be
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
solely
because
it
lacks
a
signature.
the
second
is
an
alternative
argument,
and
that's
that
a
typewritten
signature
would
suffice
to
meet
any
such
requirement.
let
me
start
with
the
sixth
circuit's
review
of
this
particular
case.
in
their
view,
there
is
a
jurisdictional
signature
requirement
in
light
of
the
thirty-day
rule
under
appellate
rule
4,
and
in
light
of
civil
rule
11,
which
indeed
does
contain
a
signature
requirement.
the
problem
with
the
sixth
circuit's
reliance
on
civil
rule
11
is
that
it
not
only
contains
a
signature
requirement,
but
it
also
contains
a
remedy
for
the
absence
of
a
signature.
and
in
this
particular
case,
everyone
agrees...
the
court-appointed
amicus
curiae
included...
that
mr.
becker
was
never
given
an
opportunity
to
correct
this
omission
of
a
signature,
whether
at
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
level.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
you
do,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
it
does
technically.
in
fact,
appellate
rule
1
arguably
acknowledges
that
when
it
says
all
filings
in
a
district
court...
all
filings
in
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
been
made
through
district
courts
have
to
comply
with
district
court
rules.
so
it
does
seem,
as
odd
as
it
would
appear,
that
civil
rule
11
does
apply
to
a
notice
of
appeal,
keeping
in
mind
that
civil
rule
11
is
pretty
broad
in
nature.
it
says
pleadings
and
quote
other
papers.
so
arguably
that
does
include
a
notice
of
appeal.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
handwritten
signature.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
it
is
problematic,
your
honor,
and
i
think
the
answer
is
appellate
rule
1
which
does,
as
i
noted,
make
clear
that
you
do
have
to
comply
with
the
district
court
rules
and
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
in
light
of
appellate
rule
1,
a
court
of
appeals
or
a
court
of
appeals
clerk's
office
would
be
fully
within
its
rights
to
contact
in
this
case
mr.
becker,
saying,
mr.
becker,
we
see
you've
typed
your
signature.
in
this
circuit
we
prefer
a
handwritten
pen
and
ink
signature.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--your
honor,
the
only
thing
that
has
to
be
done
within
thirty
days
is
to
make
sure
you've
established
an
intent
to
appeal.
you
can
establish
an
intent
to
appeal
as
this
court
is--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
as
this
court
has
construed
rule
4
and
rule
3
of
the
appellate
rules
in
smith
and
torres,
it
has
said
the
touchstone
for
jurisdiction
is
to
establish
the
intent
to
appeal
within
thirty
days.
that's--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--you
don't
know
how
good
law
smith
is?
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
i
may
be
referring
to
the
wrong
smith
decision.
i'm
referring
to
smith
v.
barry,
your
honor,
which
is
a
9-0
decision
in
which
the
court
said
that
a
merits
brief
would
suffice
to
establish
a...
or
could
suffice
to
establish
intent
to
appeal
within
thirty
days.
that
was
the
case
in
which
the
appellant
missed
the
time
for
filing
the
notice
of
appeal
because
they
weren't
sure
when...
they
hadn't...
weren't
sure
when
the
notice...
the
judgment
was
entered.
they
then
fortuitously
filed
their
merits
brief
within
the
thirty-day
period,
and
this
court
said
in
a
9-0
decision
that--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--i
do
think
there
are
some
older
cases
that
aren't
necessarily
reflected
in
the
current
rules,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--and
your
honor,
that
is
why
i
was
relying
on
appellate
rule
1
which
incorporates
those
rules,
and
that
would
therefore
give
appellate
courts
authority
to
make
sure
that
someone
did
correct
the
signature.
if
they
wanted
at
that
point
to
decide,
well,
if
you're
not
going
to
correct
it...
you're
going
to
be
unrepentant
when
it
comes
to
this
particular
requirement,
at
that
point
we
are
going
to
dismiss
your
appeal,
and
in
fact
will
do
so
on
the
merits.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
what
the
court
has
said
and
what
the
rules
reflect
is
that
as
soon
as
the
district
court
clerk
receives
the
notice
of
appeal,
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
validity,
it
is
immediately
sent
to
the
court
of
appeals.
and
i
think...
but
i
think
that
does
raise
a
second
answer
to
mr.
baker's
argument...
the
point
justice
ginsburg
is
getting
at,
it
is
true
that
to
find
a
notice
of
appeal
immediately
vests
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
appeals
over
the
merits
of
the
case,
but
that
doesn't
preclude
district
courts
from
acting
on
collateral
matters;
that's
when
they
can
act
on
stay
motions,
bond
motions,
attorney
fee
motions.
this
arguably
could
be
such
a
collateral
act.
it
wouldn't
go
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
it
would,
however,
and
i
think
there
would
be
one
problem
here,
and
that
would
be
interpretation.
the
district
courts
would
have
authority
to
enforce
this
as
a
jurisdictional
rule,
and
you
would
have
district
court
judges
dismissing
appeals
of
their
own
cases.
that
seems
problematic,
and
i
think
kind--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
yes,
justice
o'connor,
and
if
i
could
answer
this
question,
it
may
be
helpful
to
be
looking
at
the
rules.
i
am
looking
at
the
state
of
ohio's
red
brief,
i'm
at
5(a)
where
they've
got
a
helpful
collection
of
what
i
think
were
pertinent
rules.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
5(a).
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
i'm
at
the
appendix...
so
it's
the
very
back.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
and
justice
o'connor
correctly
is
pointing
to
what
i
think
is
the
best
argument
that
has
been
made...
the
amicus
curiae
argument...
and
that's
appellate
rule
3(c)(2)
which
does
refer
to
the
word
signer,
and
it
does
come
out
of
nowhere...
that
there
is
nothing
else
in
the
appellate
rules
that
refers
to
the
verbs
sign,
or
the
noun
sign,
or
a
signature,
and
suddenly
in
1993
they
do
this.
well,
i
guess
one
quick
question
is
if
mr.
baker's
interpretation
is
correct,
how
in
the
world
would
you
enforce
it?
put
yourself
in
the
position
of
the
poor
clerk
of,
let's
say,
the
sixth
circuit.
they
get,
let's
say,
mr.
becker's
notice
of
appeal
but
instead
of
a
typewritten
signature,
it
just
says
becker
in
the
caption,
becker
in
the
body,
blank...
we'll
say
for
the
sake
of
argument...
signature
line.
how
would
you
know
whether
the
person
is
represented
or
not?
you
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
whether
the
attorney...
you
don't
have
to
sign
rule...
or
the
pro
se...
you
do
have
to
sign
rule,
applies.
indeed,
the
only
way
to
enforce
it
would
have
the
clerk
do
what
i
think
they
should
be
doing
in
these
cases,
which
is
picking
up
the
phone
and
calling
and
saying
you
need
to
be
signing,
you
need
to
include
that
appellant.
of
course
if
the
question
under
mr.
baker's
rule
was
the
clerk
now
calls
and
says
are
you
represented,
well,
there
is
a
good
answer
and
a
bad
answer
to
that
question.
if
you
say
you're
represented,
you're
okay.
jurisdiction
vested,
you
didn't
have
to
sign,
and
if
you
say
you're
pro
se,
you're
gone.
so
i
can't
imagine
that's
what
they
meant,
given
that
particular
problem.
the
only
problem
with
it...
there
is
actually
a
few...
is
if
you
turn
the
page
to
6(a)
and
look
at
rule
3(c)(4)--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--because
mr.
baker,
i
think,
as
he
has
to
say--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--exactly,
which
does
happen.
some
of
the
lower
court
cases
are
cases
where
even
the
attorney
didn't
sign...
in
other
words,
you
don't
have
to
be
a
pro
se
litigant
to
make
a
mistake.
i
mean,
many
of
the
lower
court
cases
involve
non-pro
se
situations.
you've
got
a
caption,
notice
of
appeal,
no
signature
at
all.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
that's
mr.
baker's...
that's
mr.
baker's...
excuse,
me
that's
not
his
position.
that's
a
consequence
of
his
position
in
my
view,
and
i'm
making
the
point
i
can't
imagine
doing
that.
i
mean,
that's
utterly
bizarre.
but
i
think
it's
confirmed...
this,
the
reading--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
that
may
be
the
right
res...
the
best
policy,
but
there's
nothing
that
supports
that
view.
there
is
nothing
in
appellate
rules
that
says
as
to
individuals
represented
by
counsel...
they
must
sign.
that
requirement
doesn't
exist
anywhere,
so
that
we
would
be
making
up
after
the
fact,
right
now,
just
for
dale
becker's
case.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
and
3(a)(2)
while
we're
at
it.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
yes,
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
exactly.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
justice
breyer,
can
i
just
add
one?
you're
doing
a
very
good
job
for
me,
but
i
just
want
to
add
this
point...
the
clause
you
are
relying...
you
are
pointed
out
was
added
in
1993.
in
other
words,
it
was
added
the
same
time
appellate
rule
3(c)(2)
was
added.
these
were
all
post-torres
amendments
liberalizing,
making
it
easier
to
indicate
an
intent
to...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
right.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
in
the
first
respect
and
that
respect
you've
made
the
argument
that--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--that's
right.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
and
you're
in
this...
you
know...
metaphysical
netherworld
where
you
can
never
correct
and
you
can
never
appeal.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
i
have
no
idea.
i
mean,
before
this,
before
mr.
becker's
case
the
sixth
circuit
had
a
general
rule
that
they'd
applied
only
in
multiple
appellant
pro
se
cases
where
the
absence
of,
quote,
a
signature
created
this
jurisdictional
defect,
and
that's,
they
dismissed
the
appellants
who
had
not
signed.
and
i
assume
what
happened,
but
again,
i
am
assuming,
i
have
no
idea
what
happened.
all
i
know
is
that
it
took
seven
months
for
the
appeal
to
be
dismissed.
so
that
leads
me
to
believe
this
went
to
the
section
of
the
sixth
circuits
that
handles
those
types
of
appeals.
someone,
at
least
partly
correctly,
realized
their
mattingly
rule,
saw
that
you
had
the
typewritten
signature,
and
i
guess
in
an
act
of,
you
know,
precision,
at
least
in
their
view,
thought
that
didn't
count,
but
didn't
give
mr.
becker
an
opportunity
to
argue
otherwise
that,
you
know,
his
typewritten
signature
would
suffice
or,
for
that
matter,
to
make
the
point
you
should
never
apply
this
multiple
party
rule
on
the
contest
of
a
single
appellant
who's
put
his
name
on
the
notice
of
appeal
three
times.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
this
is
division
that
really...
that
did
exist
in
the
lower
courts.
there
was
not
a
division
on
the
single
appellant
problem...
they've
all
ruled
our
way.
but
in
the
lower
courts
you've
got
some,
take
the
seventh
circuit
as
an
example,
that
said
it's
nonjurisdictional
and
they
say
they
just
simply
ask
someone
to
correct
it
and
clarify
whether
all
three
appellants
meant
to
appeal,
even
though
only
one
of
them
hand-signed
the
notice.
and
others
say,
no,
that's
jurisdictional.
they
look
at
this
court's
decision
in
torres
and
say
you've
got
to
establish
within
the
four
corners
of
the
document
within
thirty
days
a,
quote,
intent
to
appeal.
i
think
the
seventh
circuit
view
is
the
better
view.
i
mean,
this
is
a
minimalistic
requirement.
in
fact,
it
all
comes
from
a
statute.
the
rules
aren't
allowed
under
rule
1
to
expand
or
shrink
the
courts
of
appeals'
jurisdictions;
the
only
statutory
requirement
is
28
u.s.c.
2107,
and
that
just
says
just
get
your
intent,
just
file
the
notice
of
appeals
within
thirty
days.
and
if
you--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--not
jurisdictional
ones,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
the
rules
enabling
act.
the
rules
enabling
act
says
that
you
can
only
create
these
rules
for
the
purposes
applying
and
implementing
these
court
decisions
and
the
administration
of
the
lower
court.
it
doesn't
allow
this
court
or
the
lower
courts
or
advisory
committees
to
create
rules
that
expand
or
shrink
this
court's
jurisdiction.
let
me
give
you
an
example--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--there's
no
doubt.
you
can
set
up
procedures,
and
you
can
set
up
consequences
for
failing
to
follow
those
procedures.
that's
not
this
case.
this
is
a
case
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i'm
not
sure
i
really
want
to
answer
your
question
or
some
others
going
down
that
road,
because
i've
got
a
lot
of
angry
mail
from
the
court
of
appeals
clerks,
but
i
don't
know
why
you
can
do
that.
let
me
give
you
an
example
in
response
to
mr.
chief
justice's
question.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
why,
in
rule
3
this
court
can't
promulgate
rules
that
are
then
ultimately
approved
by
congress
that
say...
silently
approved
by
congress...
that
says
in
order
to
have
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
appeals,
you
must
have
your
facsimile
number
on
the
notice
of
appeals.
how...
where
do
they
have
the
authority
to
shrink
the
jurisdiction
of
that
court
of
appeals?
they
could
say
you
need
to
put
your
facsimile
number
on
the
notice
of
appeal
as
a
rule,
and
then
enforce
that
rule
however
they
wish.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
no.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
i
think
that
probably
is
not
a
problem.
i
mean,
i
think
all
you've
got
to
do
is
establish
an
intent
to
appeal
within
thirty
days,
and
it
would
seem...
the
assumption
there
is
that
it
is
in
writing,
and
i
am
sure
that's
what
congress
assumed;
i'm
sure
they
didn't--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--28
u.s.c.
2107.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
that's
the
30-day,
it's
in
the
back
of
our
brief,
the
blue
brief.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
if
i
could
turn
to
this...
to
the
quote
signature
requirement,
which
is
an
alternative
issue
here,
and
as
i
think
everyone
knows,
if
you
look
at
ja12,
that
is
mr.
becker's
notice
of
appeal,
and
you
will
see
he's
got
his
name
in
three
places,
including
on
the,
quote,
signature
line
where
he
typed
rather
than
hand-wrote
his
signature.
and
the
question
is
whether
the
appellate,
civil
rules
or
any
other
rules
somehow
require
a
pen-and-ink
signature.
there
is
no
definition
of
the
verb
signed
or
the
noun
signature
or
signer
anywhere
in
the
rules;
that's
not
of
much
help.
the
dictionary
definition
circa
1938
or
even
1993
are
equivocal...
they
go
both
directions...
so
that's
not
of
much
help.
and
you've
got
the
very
real
problem...
not
in
mr.
becker's
case
but
surely
in
the
case
of
some
appellants...
that
some
individuals
may
well
not
be
able
to,
quote,
pen
and
ink
a
notice
of
appeal.
you
could
imagine
someone
with
a
disability
that
could
only
type
a
notice
of
appeal;
you
could
imagine
an
individual
in
a
maximum
security
prison...
a
pro
se
appellant...
where
that
particular
warden
doesn't
allow
the
inmates
to
have--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
some
of
our
cases
actually
are
bank
note
cases,
your
honor.
but
i
do
think
the
answer
to
your
question
is
most
people
would
pen
and
ink
it.
i
agree
with
you.
but
that's
also
why
most
banks
have
on
hand
a
copy
of
each
client's
signature.
we
don't
do
that
in
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
that's
a
fair
criticism,
your
honor.
i
have.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
i
do
mean
pen
and
ink.
i
think
everyone
ought
to
have
some
liberty
to
coin
phrases
here
since
there
are
no
definitions
at
all,
and
i
think
the
advocates
are
stuck
a
little
bit
for
that
reason.
but
there
doesn't
seem...
i
mean,
form
follows
function
here.
there's
no
reason
which
it
comes
to
a
notice
of
appeal
why
it
has
to
be
in
pen
and
ink.
the
point
is
to
establish
an
intent
to
appeal.
it
is
a
minimal
threshold.
at
that
point,
any
doubt
about
who
is
involved
and
who's
not
can
be
readily
clarified
by
the
court--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--that
is
true,
but
your
honor,
that
is
assuming
that
pro
se
appellants
and
pro
se
appellants
only
are
more
likely
to
commit
fraud.
i
don't
think
that
that's
a
fair
assumption.
i
mean,
the
notion
of
an
impostor
appellant--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--my
point
is
the
only
reason
to
require
a
pen
and
ink
signature
requirement
is
because
you're
fearful
that
the
individual
that
did
the
typing
is
somehow
misleading
the
court
and
pulling
a
fast
one
on
his
or
her
co-appellants.
that
is
not
confirming
they
do
indeed
want
to
appeal.
i
think
it's
a
fair
assumption
when
you
see
in
the
body
of
the
notice
of
appeal
all
three
parties
listed,
or
for
that
matter
in
the
caption
as
the
rule
allows...
that's
enough.
i
mean,
i
don't
care
whether
it
has
one
signature
or
no
signatures...
you've
conveyed
an
intent
to
appeal.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
it's
an
interesting
point.
we
do
have
a
situation
where
some
district
courts
are
allowing
e-mail
type
signatures--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
they're
allowing...
i
don't
know
whether
the
northern
district
of
ohio
is
doing
that.
i
know
they're
doing
that
generally
when
it
comes
to
cases
in
their
courts,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--a
less
common--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--your
honor,
of
all
people,
this...
i
mean,
we've
got
a
separation
of
powers
problem
here.
congress
says
there
is...
there
is
a
thirty-day
requirement
in
the
statute,
and
that's
all
it
says.
and
suddenly
the
courts
are
allowed
to
decide
who
to
push
out
and
who
to
include
in?
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
and
i
think
that
is
the
best
argument
when
it
comes
to
interpreting
the
congressional
statute...
that
in
other
words,
the
notice
of
appeal
does
come
with
certain
assumptions.
there
is
nowhere,
though,
that
that
assumption
has
to
include
the
handwritten
signature.
there's
no
assumption
on
that?
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
based
on
the
law
or
the
cases?
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
i--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--your
honor,
i'm
not
sure...
first
of
all,
i'm
not
entirely
sure
i
understood
the
way
you
characterized
the
first
part
of
my
argument,
so
let
me
tell
you
how
i
have
been
trying
to
argue
it
which
is
that
you
don't
need
anything.
that
is
my
point.
the
first
argument
is
that
you
don't
need
a
typewritten,
handwritten,
an
x,
anything.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
yes,
you
do
need
a
name.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
look
at
12...
look
at
12(a).
look
at
12(a)
which
is
the
joint...
in
the
joint
appendix...
and
this
is
the
sample
notice
of
appeal
that
mr.
becker
got
from
the
sixth
circuit
and
he
used,
and
this
is
what
most
notice
of
appeals
look
like...
they
are
one
page.
what
you
do
have
to
do
is
within
thirty
days
convey
an
intent
to
appeal.
you
can
do
that
without
any
signature
at
all.
you
can
do
that
with
your
name
in
the
caption.
in
fact,
rule
3
says
that.
you
can--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--exactly.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
sure
it
does,
your
honor.
if
in
the,
it
says
notice
is
hereby
given
that
blank...
and
it
says
dale
g.
becker,
john
smith
and
john
moore...
and
then
you've
got
a
blank
signature
line.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
absolutely.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
absolutely.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
the
forms
are
jurisdictional.
i'm
using
the
forms
to
try
to
visualize
the
issue.
i'm
not
making
any
concession
they're
jurisdictional...
i'm
just
trying
to
help
us
visualize
it,
and
you
were
suggesting
you've
got
the
poor
clerk
at
the
sixth
circuit
gets
a
notice
of
appeal
with
no
signature,
and
they
don't
know
what
to
do.
that's
just
not
true.
whether
it
is
one
appellant
or
fifty-five
appellants.
if
in
the
body
of
the
notice
of
appeal
or
the
caption,
as
the
rules
say,
the
appellants
are
all
listed,
how
can
there
possibly
be
any
jurisdictional
doubt
as
to
who
is
trying
to
appeal?
there
is
no
doubt.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
but,
your
honor,
that's
one
possibility,
and
your
suggestion
is
that
when
they
don't
sign,
they
somehow
decide
at
the
last
second...
i'm
going
to
put
my
name
in
the
pile--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--that's
possible,
your
honor,
but
that
goes
back
to
my
response
to
justice
ginsburg.
somehow
the
assumption
that
there's
someone
committing
fraud
or
there
are
impostor
appellants
out
there...
that's
not
a
problem
that
exists.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
the
reason
this
lenity
exists
is
not
because
people
decide,
oh,
boy,
i'm
having
doubts
at
the
last
second
whether
to
put
my
signature
here,
it's
because
they
make
mistakes.
and
people
make
them
all
the
time.
god
knows...
i
mean,
i
can't
think
of
a
lawyer
that
hasn't
made
this
kind
of
mistake.
it
gets
filed
without
the
signature,
and
that's
exactly--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--absolutely.
and
that's
what
rule
3(c)(4)
means
exactly.
so
any
doubt
about
this
problem
can
be
resolved
after
the
thirty-day
window
which
is
the
jurisdictional
window.
if
i
could
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
a
few
brief
points.
first
of
all,
in
defense
of
dale
becker,
the
form
he
used
is
actually
the
form
that's
now
attached
to
the
sixth
circuit
rules.
it
is
not
outdated.
it
is
attached
to
their
current
rules.
second,
the
notion
that
prison
inmates
should
be
consulting
websites
to
get
the
forms
doesn't
seem
to
me
plausible.
third,
when
it
comes
to
the
forms
that
mr.
baker
has
relied
upon,
if
you
look
at
our
yellow
brief,
there
is
a
great
irony
here
to
his
argument
that
this
signature
rule
only
applies
to
pro
se
appellants.
every
one
of
the
forms
refers
to
signatures
for
attorneys.
if
you
look
at
the
one
that's
attached
to
the
federal
rules...
that's
at
a-1...
it's
clear
the
signature
requirement
is
not
for
the
pro
se...
it
says
the
s
and
then
attorney.
and
then
you
look
at
mr
becker's...
baker's...
becker's
form,
it's
counsel
for
appellant.
you
then
look
at
the
next
one
and
it
has
attorney.
every
single
one
of
them,
if
there
is
a
signature
requirement
at
all,
it's
referring
to
attorneys.
there
is
no
indication
that
pro
se
litigants
and
pro
se
litigants
alone
are
expected
to
sign
these
things
in
whatever
manner.
every
other
point
that
mr.
baker
has
raised...
and
there
are
many
policy
problems
out
there...
they
are
all
problems
that
show
at
most
there
is
a
signature
requirement,
not
a
signature
jurisdictional
requirement.
every
single
one
of
those
issues
can
be
cured
and
addressed
after
the
thirty
days.
thank
you.
