mr.
stewart
a.
baker
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
just
correct
one
point
that
petitioner's
attorney
made...
the
sixth
circuit
has
applied
their
jurisdictional
rule
excluding
unsigned
notice
of
appeal
to
single
appellants.
they've
done
so
in
numerous
unpublished
opinions.
the
fact
that
they're
unpublished,
i
think,
suggests
that
they
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
difference
between
single
or
multiple
appellants,
and
that
distinction
has
been
introduced
by
petitioner's
attorney
at
this
stage,
and
this
stage
only.
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
yes.
the...
the
difficulty
with
that
is
that
rule
4
sets
a
thirty-day
limit
on
filing
of
proper
notice
of
appeal,
and
therefore
if
you
can
correct
it
within
the
thirty
days
there
is
not
a
problem,
but
if
you
can't
correct
it
within
the
thirty
days,
there
is
a
jurisdictional
issue
that
arises.
it
arises--
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
--the
signature
requirement
is
part
of
expressing
the
intent
of
the
party
to
appeal.
it's...
since
1980,
the
courts
of
appeals
have
said
that
specify
the
party
or
parties
taking
the
appeal
includes
in
a
pro
se
context
the
signature
of
the
party
who
intends
to
take
the
appeal.
even
in
a
single--
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
--i
think
that
rule
11
clearly
requires
that
it
be
signed.
i...
rule
11
is
incorporated,
at
least
as
far
as
the
form
of
the
filing,
into
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure.
and
then
rule
3(c)
clearly
references
an
expectation
that
there
will
be
a
signer
in
every
pro
se
notice
of
appeal.
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
it
says
it
shall
be
struck
unless
it's
been
cured
after
notice,
which
i
think
is
a
slightly
more
emphatic
statement
than--
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
--well,
the
difficulty
with
taking
that
approach
is
first
that
rule
11
is
a
district
court
rule;
it
sets
form
requirements
and
it
tells
the
court
what
it
can
do
in
response
to
an
unsigned
notice
of
appeal.
a
portion
of
that
comes
to
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure
but
simply
the
form
requirements...
not
the
authority
to
take
action...
it
would
be
very--
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
--uh--
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
--well,
the
legislative
history
for
that
says
that
in
some
instances
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure
provide
that
a
motion
must
or
may
be
filed
in
the
district
court...
i'm
reading
from
our
footnote
on
page
seventeen
in
the
green
brief.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
the
proposed
amendment
would
make
it
clear
that
when
this
is
so,
the
motion
or
application
is
to
be
made
in
the
form
and
manner
prescribed
in
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
in
other
words
it
says
that
if
there
is
a
form
and
manner
requirement,
you
must
meet
it
in
the
district
court.
i
think
it
would
be
unusual
for
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure
to
say,
and
by
the
way
you
can
borrow
whatever
authority
the
district
court
may
have.
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
well,
it
says...
but
the
requirement
is
that
it
be
signed.
i
think
the
requirement
is
not
that
it
be
signed
if
you've
gotten
a
notice
from
the
court.
it
simply
says
it
must
be
signed;
it
shall
be
stricken
unless
certain...
certain
things
have
happened.
those--
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
--if...
if
we
were
only
borrowing
rule
11
here,
i
think
this
argument
would
be
much
stronger,
but
we...
the
advisory
committee
has
gone
over
this
territory
already,
the
courts
of
appeals,
as
i
said,
since
1980
have
found
that
the
jurisdictional
language
of
rule
3
includes
the
signature
requirements...
not
all
of
them,
but
the
fourth
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit,
and
others.
and
the
advisory
committee,
which
addressed
this
question
after
torres
made
it
quite
clear
that
specify
the
parties
is
a
jurisdictional
requirement,
had
in
front
of
them
language
that
would
have
gotten
rid
of
the
signature
requirement,
and
instead
modified
that
language
to
make
it
clear
that
a
signature
was
expected
from
every
pro
se
party
filing
a
notice
of
appeal.
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
it's...
it's...
it's
obviously
not
perfect,
your
honor.
on
the
other
hand,
i
have
difficulty
reading
it
as
only
saying
that
the
signature
requirement
for
the
spouse
and
children
which
would
be
the
result
of
saying,
well,
this...
this
says
there's
a
signature
requirement
of
the
spouse
and
child
but
it's
met
by
the
signature
of
the
pro
se
party.
i...
i'm
not
sure
that
produces
a
more
sensible
rule
than
one
that
says
it
treats
the
pro
se
party
and
the
pro
se
party's
family
members
all
the
same.
they
are--
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
--i
think
that
that's...
that's
plausible
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
the
advisory
committee
had
in
front
of
it
language
that
would
have
achieved
that
without
introducing
a
signature
requirement
or
any
notion
of
a
signature
requirement
provided
by
public
citizens.
the...
the
language
provided
by
public
citizens
would
have
clearly
undone
the
signature
requirements
that
had
been
imposed
by
some
of
the
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
that
may
well
be,
i...
but
i
think
that
it's...
it's
impossible
to
pick
up
that
rule...
the...
the...
the
civil
rule
of
procedure...
without
taking
into
account
rule
4
which
says
the
notice
of
appeal
has
to
be
filed
within
thirty
days.
there
is
clearly
a
signature
requirement
under
rule
11;
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
i
think
the
reason
that
it
can't
be
is
that
the
signature
requirement
has
been
pulled
into
rule
3
for
pro
se
parties
by
the
direct
reference
to
an
expectation
that
the
pro
se
party
will
sign
the
notice
of
appeal.
it
is
hard
to
read
that
language
without
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
something
about
the
notice
of
appeal,
and
the
standards
for
notice
of
appeal,
that
is...
that
requires
a
signature
from
pro
se
parties,
and
there
are
good,
obviously
policy,
reasons
for
wanting
to
do
that.
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
i
think
though
that
the
principal
problem
that
the
signature
requirement
addresses
is
the
risk
that
someone
is
practicing
law...
probably
without
a
license...
on
behalf
of
a
party
who
may
or
may
not
understand
what
is
being
done
in
his
name.
the
signature
requirement
allows
the
court
to
be
sure
that
the
party
who
is
nominally
appearing
pro
se
in
fact
has
had
a
chance
to
think
about
what
he
is
doing,
and
to
examine
the
contents
of
what
has
been
filed
in
his
name.
that
is
the
reason
that
in
multiple
appellant
cases...
this
rule
has
been
applied
without
controversy,
yet
because
it
is
obvious
there
that
one
party
may
be
proceeding
to
draft
pleadings
that
the
others
may
not
have
seen.
but
in
the
context
of
single
appellants
as
well,
there
are
numerous
areas
of
law
where
there
is
an
active
cottage
industry
of
assisting
pro
se
litigants...
not
just
prison
cases
but
bankruptcy
cases,
immigration
cases,
where
people
who
hold
themselves
out
as
grievance
consultants
or
other
forms
of
quasi-lawyer,
have
taken
to
filing
pro
se
papers
on
behalf
of
parties.
the
signature
requirement
at
least
requires
that
those
pro
se
parties
have
a
chance
to
see
what
has
been
done
in
their
names.
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
i...
i
do
agree
with
that.
i
think
that
if
one
reads
this
as
narrowly
as
possible,
that
the
signature
requirement
does
not
apply
to
represented
parties.
it
applies,
but
the
attorney--
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
--right.
and...
and
there
are
reasons
for
that.
if
an
attorney
says
i
represent
these
parties
and
they're
taking
the
appeal
and
he's
not
telling
the
truth,
he's
subject
to
a
wide
variety
of
sanctions
that
would
not
apply
to
a
non-lawyer
who
made
that
same
representation
and
therefore,
it's
a...
it's
a
plausible
distinction
to...
to
draw.
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
i...
i...
think
that's
a
difficulty.
i...
i
would
suggest...
i
don't
know
how
mr.
becker
got
that
form.
i...
i
think
it
would
be
useful
to
take
a
look
at
the
yellow
brief
pages
of
a-2
and
a-3
because,
in
fact,
the
form
that
mr.
becker
got
is
outdated
even
by
the
sixth
circuit
standards.
if
you
go
to
the
sixth
circuit
website,
you
go
to
the
notices
and
download
the
forms,
the
form
you
will
get
is
the
form
on
page
a-3
of
the
yellow
brief,
not
on
page
a-2
which
is
the
form
that
mr.
becker
submitted.
indeed,
if
you
look
at
the...
at
the
lower
lefthand
corner
of
each
of
those
documents,
you'll
see
that
each
of
them
is
labeled
6ca3,
which
is
the
name
of
the...
the
number
of
the
form.
each
of
them
in
fact
on
the
originals
has
a
gpo
designation,
but
the
notice
on
page
a-3
is
dated
january
'99
as
opposed
to
august
of
'79,
and
this
is
the
pages...
the
form
on
page
a-3
is
the
form
that
is
available
to
litigants,
and
that
should
be
sent
out,
and
it
certainly
calls
for
a
signature,
has
the
little
s.
so
there
may
well
have
been
a
mistake
here
in
mr.
becker's
case,
but
i
think
it
would
be
going
beyond
the
facts
that
we
have
in
the
record
to
assume
that
this
is
a
policy
on
the
part
of
the
sixth
circuit
to
send
out
a
notice
of
appeal
when
it's
not--
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
--mr.
becker
has
filed
nearly
twenty
cases
in
the
federal
and
state
courts
in
ohio;
he
has
signed
practically
every
paper
he's
filed
in
practically
every
one
of
those
cases,
including
all
of
his
notices
of
appeal
to
the
sixth
circuit
in
past
cases.
rule
11
says
sign
everything
you
file
in
the
district
court.
i...
i
think
it
would
be
aggressive
for
him
to
suggest
that
simply
because
the
s
was
missing
from
this
form,
he
doesn't
have
to
pay
any
attention
to
those...
those
rules.
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
but
when
one
has
that
one
is
confronted
with
a
notice
of
appeal,
as
is
the
typical
case...
and
here
we've
had
a
half
a
dozen
substantive
motions
and
briefs,
and
so
we're
starting
to
get
a
feel
for
mr.
becker
and
what
his
intent
was...
but
the
purpose
of
the
requirement
is
to
know
immediately,
and
in
a
way
that's
not
easily
deniable
by
the
appellant...
what
his
intent
is,
that
he
actually
intends
to
file
this
appeal
and
be
bound
by
the
consequences,
even
if
they're
bad,
as
they
may
well
be
for
a
frivolous
appeal.
if
i
could
touch
briefly
on
the
question
of
whether
the
rules
enabling
act
prevents
the
application
of
this
rule,
i
think
it
is
answered
by
the
torres
case
which
said,
after
all,
that
even
though
it
was
perfectly
obvious
in
that
case
that
all
of
the
plaintiffs
who
had
lost
intended
to
seek
the
appeal,
the
fact
that
one
of
the
plaintiffs'
names
had
been
left
off
of
the
document
meant
that
there
was
no
notice
of
appeal
as
to
him,
and
that
the
requirements
of
the
parties
be
specified
with
a
jurisdictional
requirement.
i
don't
think
the
rules
enabling
act
said,
wait
a
minute,
you're
narrowing
the
scope
of
the
notice
of
appeal.
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
yes,
i
am,
because
that
was
the
position
since
at
lease
1980
of
some
of
the
courts
of
appeals
and
the
position
that
we
believe
was
adopted
by
the
advisory
committee
in
1993.
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
of
course,
one
could
draw
the
distinction...
i'm
not
sure
that
the
rules
enabling
act
would
say
that
that
distinction
is
the...
is
the
limit
of
what
the
court's
authority
is.
i
think
the
court
has
the
authority
to
say
we
want
you
to
specify
the
party...
the
party
taking
the
appeal
in
a
manner
that
leaves
the
party
no
room
to
back
out
later.
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
the
cases
that
i
have
seen
apply
it
to
pro
se
pleadings.
i
have
not
seen
it
applied
jurisdictionally
to
represented
parties.
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
well,
if
he...
if
he
did
then
it
wouldn't
have
the
lawyer's
signature
on
it.
it
would
have
someone
else's
signature
on
it.
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
even
if
the
lawyer
had...
if
he
was
a
represented
party,
he
filed
pro
se?
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
i
would
say
it
was
because
it
doesn't
have
a
signature
from
the
pro
se
party,
and
it's
not...
you
haven't
specified
the
party's
intent
to--
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
--i...
i...
i...
if
i
have
thought
of
it
in
terms
of
a
represented
party
where
the
lawyer
is
actually
pursuing
the
appeal.
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
it
may
not
be
a
jurisdictional
defect,
but
it
is
obviously
easily
struck
because
it
doesn't
represent
the
intent
of
the
party.
if
it...
if
it
purports
to
be
a
pro
se
petition,
notice
of
appeal,
then
it's
jurisdictionally
deficient.
if
it
purports
to
be
on
an
attorney
notice
of
appeal,
then
it's
fraught.
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
yes.
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
exactly,
and
therefore
either
you've
already
decided
this,
which
i
suspect
is
not
the
appropriate
answer,
or
it's
not
part
of
the
case
because
there
was
no
conflict
in
the
circuits
on
that
question.
if
i
could
turn
also
to
the
question
of
a
lawyer
not
signing...
i
think
mr.
sutton
made
the
argument
that
an
attorney...
if
you
were
a
represented
party
and
you
did
not
sign,
it
would
not
be
jurisdictional.
if
you
were
a
non-represented
party
and
you
did
not
sign,
it
would
be
jurisdictional,
and
that
there
would
be
some
doubt
about
that
possibility
raised
the
prospect,
i
think,
of
people
trying
to
game
the
system
by
rushing
out
and
hiring
lawyers
or
having
lawyers
submit
things
that
weren't
signed.
i
think
it's
worth
remembering
this
is
not
a
difficult
requirement
to
meet.
signing
the
notice
of
appeal
is
an
easy
thing
to
do;
it
provides
useful
confirmation
to
the
court
that
every
party
who
is
part
of
the
notice
of
appeal
actually
has
seen
and
has
willingly
joined
in
it.
and
so
the
likelihood
that
people
will
game
this
system
in
order
to
avoid
signing
the
notice
of
appeal
i
think
is...
is
highly
unlikely.
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
this
court
has...
has
tended
to
say
that
rule
3
is
jurisdictional
in
general
terms.
certainly
i
would
say
that
rule
3(c)
and
its
provisions
which
say
that
you
must
specify
the
party
or
parties
taking
the
appeal...
that's
what
the
torres
case
held,
that
failure
to
specify
is
a
jurisdictional
fault,
designation
of
the
judgment
appealed
from,
designation
of
the
court
appealed
to.
and
as
i
said,
most...
many
courts
had
held
that
to
specify
the
party
included
a
signature
requirement
as
part
of
determining
intent
to
appeal.
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
none
of
those
things
can
be
cured
after
the
thirty
days
has...
has
run,
and
i
believe
that's
established
law.
i
would
like
to--
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
--the...
the
court
in
smith
against
barry,
and
to
a
degree
in
torres,
suggested
that
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
notice
of
appeal
is
all
that
is
required,
but
by
functional
equivalent
the...
the
court
has
essentially
treated
the
three
elements
that
must
be
in
a
notice
of
appeal
as
what
must
be
conveyed
in
one
form
or
another.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
in
the
form
of
a
notice
of
appeal,
but
that
information
has
got
to
be
part
of
the
notice
of
appeal
or,
in
the
absence
of
one
of
those
elements,
it's
jurisdictionally--
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
--what
he's
appealing,
and
where
he's
appealing
to.
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
i...
i...
i
would...
i
would
argue
that
in
fact
when
the
advisory
committee...
the
only
substantive
revision
of
rule
3(c)
that's
been
made
was
made
in
1993
by
the
advisory
committee.
when
they
made
that
change,
there
was
none
of
this
division
into
sub...
separate
subparagraphs
of
3(c).
there
was
a
requirement
to
do
the
three
things...
to
specify
the
three
things.
the
first
was
specify
the
parties,
and
what
the
advisory
committee
did
was
insert
this
reference
to
a
signature
by
a
pro
se
party
directly
after
the
requirement
that
the
party
taking
the
appeal
be
specified,
and
i
think
the
only
conclusion
you
can
draw
from
that
is
they
believed
that
they
were
providing
a
gloss
on
how
to
specify
the
party
or
parties
taking
the
appeal.
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
torres
had
already
done
that
most
emphatically--
mr.
stewart
a.
baker
--yes.
but
as
i
said,
the
entire
effort
by
the
advisory
committee
was
to
insert...
it
was
to
clarify
what
it
meant
to
specify
the
party
so
people
wouldn't
make
mistakes
in
the
future.
if
i
could
make
one
point
in
closing,
it's
that
i
was
struck
as
i
was
reading
the
cases
that
we've
been
talking
about
here,
such
as
torres,
the
foman
case
from
the
'60s,
houston
and
flack...
all
of
the
cases
that
construe
the
rules
of
the
court...
of
the
appellate
courts...
that
almost
none
of
them
have
survived
in
terms
of
their
holdings.
almost
every
one
has
been
modified
by
the
advisory
committee
and
the
rules
process.
given
the
number
of
problems
we've
turned
up
in
this
area,
i
think
that
it's
inevitable
that
this
issue
is
bound
for
the
advisory
committee
one
way
or
the
other,
and
yet
we
still
cite
all
those
cases,
and
we
cite
them
not
for
their
particular
holding,
but
for
the
way
they
analyzed
these
problems.
if
they
say,
well,
you
know,
the
rules
can
be
bent
to
achieve
a
certain
aim,
then
that's
what
they
stand
for.
if
they
say
the
rules
should
be
read
in
as
straightforward
and
lawyerly
a
way
as
one
can
and
take
the
consequences,
then
that's
what
those
rules...
those
cases
stand
for.
i
would
submit
that
if
you
take
the
latter
course,
the
sixth
circuit
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
