mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
essentially
focus
on
three
basic
points,
what
the
court
held
in
nierotko,
the
importance
of
the
1946
amendments
to
the
social
security
act
on
both
the
benefits
and
the
tax
side,
and
then
finally
try
to
discuss
and
balance
the
relative
positions
with
respect
to
the
administrative
convenience
or
inconvenience
of
the
various
positions
taken
here
today.
with
respect
to
nierotko,
i
think
i
understand
the
united
states
to
have
finally
conceded
that
the
pivotal
language
in
the
nierotko
decision
is
the
wages-paid
language,
and
that
there
is
no
meaningful
distinction
between
the
wages-paid
language
that
was
the
basis
for
the
interpretation
in
that
case
and
the
wages-paid
language
that
we
have
inherited
now
that
is
the
subject
of
the
provisions
that
are
at
issue
in
this
particular
case.
but
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
question
on
that,
i
would
ask
the
court
to
recognize
first
of
all
it's
clear
that
the
court
was
interpreting
the
1939
amendments,
which
contains
that
language.
the
first
paragraph
of
the
opinion
refers
to
quarters
of
coverage,
which
was
a
concept
that
did
not
exist
prior
to
1939,
so
it
clearly
had
'39
in
mind
at
that
point.
and
then
if
you
look
at
the
penultimate
and
the
ultimate
paragraph
of
the
supreme
court...
of
this
court's
opinions,
it
also
discusses
quite
specifically
that...
the
provision
that's
at
stake
here
and
it
says,
you
know,
the
petitioner
argues,
to
put
it
into
context,
the
amendments
of
1939
use
quarters
as
the
basis
for
eligibility
as
well
as
the
measure
of
benefits,
and
require
wages
to
be
paid
in
certain
quarters,
and
this
court
then,
in
rejecting
essentially
that
argument
said,
we
have
no
doubt
that
it,
referring
to
back
pay,
should
be
allocated
to
the
periods
when
the
regular
wages
were
not
paid
as
usual.
i
think
there's
no
other
way
to
interpret
nierotko
except
for
saying
that
language
of
wages
paid
in
the
benefits
context,
certainly,
means
that
you
allocate
it
back
to
when
those
wages
should
have
been
paid
under
the...
under
that
particular
scheme.
it's
a
special
rule
for
back
pay.
obviously,
it
doesn't
deal
with
the
general
accrual
problems.
it
doesn't
resurrect
any
of
the
accrual
problems.
it
doesn't
ask
you
to
try
to
make
those
kinds
of
decisions.
it
asks
you
to
say,
when
would
they
have
been
paid
if
the
employer--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
it
was
a
benefits
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
which
is
why
it
then
becomes
pivotal
to
turn
to
1946.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
i
think
that's
correct.
i
mean,
it
might
turn
out
if
the
employer--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--is
late
and
there's
some
fault
attributed
to
it,
that
might
be
a
different
issue,
but
if
he
just
paid
at
a
different
time
and
there's
no
issue
about
it,
it's
not
back
pay
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
scheme,
so
you
know--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
obviously,
a
dispute
as
to
whether
this
was
back
pay
for
purposes
of
this
rule.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
there
are
regulations
that
define
back
pay,
and
do
it
in
terms
of
payments
that
would
have
been
made
by
the
employer,
you
know,
but
for
the
employer's
wrongdoing,
but
i
don't...
and
i
don't
understand
the
government
to
either,
at
any
point
in
this
litigation
to
have
raised
any
question
as
to
whether
this
is
fairly
describable
as
back
pay.
as
i
understand
the
question
they've
asked
the
court
to
decide
is,
assuming
it's
back
pay,
what's
the
appropriate
allocation
rule
for
that
kind
of
an
approach.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
may
well
be
back
pay,
depending
on
the
circumstances.
if
the
reason
i
didn't
pay
is
because
i've
breached
the
contract,
and
i
have
an
obligation
to
pay
it
under
those
circumstances,
it
might
well
be
back
pay
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
sorry?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
i
mean...
but
i
mean,
i
don't
think
you're
entitled
to
hold
off
paying
because
you
don't
have
the
money.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
well,
the
back-pay
definition
in
the
regulations
is,
pay
received
in
one
period
of
time
which
would
have
been
paid
in
a
prior
period
of
time
except
for
a
wrongful
or
improper
action
taken
by
an
employer,
under
that
circumstance
i
suspect
that
would
fall
within
back
pay,
as
the
federal
government
itself
deals
with
it,
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
is
in
the
year
received,
as
it
turns
out
today,
but
recall,
justice
o'connor,
back
when
this
was
all
enacted
in
both
1939
and
1946
it
would
not
have
been
paid
under
those
circumstances.
there
was
a
whole
different
regime
with
respect
to
income
taxes
that
existed
at
that
time,
and
against
which
congress
was
acting
with
respect
to
the
taxing
part
and
the
benefits
part
of
the
social
security
act.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
might
be.
i
don't
have
a
view
on
that
actually,
justice
kennedy.
all
i'm
doing
is
reading
the
reg
and
saying
that
they
attribute
to...
you
know,
the
question
is
whether
it's
wrongful.
there
may
be
issues--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right,
and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
my
guess
is
there
would
be
a
basis
for
which
you
could
make
a
claim
of
back
pay,
but
that's
obviously
not
what
congress
was
concerned
about
when
it
modified
the
rule
to
make
it
simpler.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
was
dealing
with
the
traditional
accrual
problem
of
payments
that
you
expect
in
the
ordinary
course
to
be
paid
at
times
that
are
different
from
when
the
services
arise,
and
then
what
do
you
do
in
that
situation,
which
is
a
pretty
common
problem.
it's
one
i
face
every
year.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
sorry?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
absolutely,
justice
breyer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--you
know,
the
court
addressed
exactly
the
same
quote,
mess,
in
nierotko
itself.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
it
addressed--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right,
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
justice
breyer,
the
point
is,
is
that
there
are
still
the
same
accounting
questions
that
will
arise
under
that
scheme,
that
will
arise
under
our
interpretation
today,
and
this
court...
and
the
government
argued,
don't
go
that
route,
because
there
will
be
accounting
problems.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
they
are
very,
very
similar,
justice
breyer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
the
court
dismissed
those
as
not
insuperable.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
one
is,
in
the
1946
amendments,
congress
was
very
clear
when
it
said,
what
we
want
here
is
conformity
on
the
benefits
side
and
on
the
tax
side,
and
therefore
the
ultimate
question
about
administrative
convenience
isn't
the
answer.
what
congress
wanted
was
for
the
two
schemes
to
be
the
same,
so
to
the
extent
that
the
benefits
tends
to
take
you
back
in
time,
as
i
think
the
government
has
conceded
today
it
continues
to
do,
in
order
to
comply
or
to
further
the
overall
objective
of
congress
in
1946,
you
have
to
do
the
same
thing
on
the
tax
side,
otherwise
conformity
is
completely
impossible
to
achieve,
and
that's
the
overriding
congressional
purpose,
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
mean,
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
one
is
the
overall
purpose
of
the
court's
mission
here
is
presumably
to
implement
congress'
intent,
and
if
congress
says
to
you,
by
adopting
exactly
the
same
words
for
two
separate
provisions
that
deal
with
two
different
schemes--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--then
it
seems
to
me
the
answer
is,
adopt
congress'...
and
tells
you
we
want
conformity
between
the
two--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--then
the
only...
i'm
sorry,
justice--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes.
for
the
last
50
years
the
social
security
administration--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes,
on
both
sides,
though.
remember,
social
security
administration--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--has
had
an
equally
uniform
rule
that
it
has
applied
since
the
very
day
nierotko
was
decided,
and
when
the
1946
amendments
went
into
place,
and
if
you
look
at
the
lodging
that
we
filed
that
identifies--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--a
description
of
this
analysis
by
the
social
security
administration,
from
day
one
they
said,
the
court
said
in
nierotko,
for
back
pay
you
have
to
allocate
it
back,
and
that's
the
way
we're
going
to
apply
it,
and
that
sort
of
makes
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right,
but
that's
clearly
wrong,
because
when
you're
dealing...
i
mean,
it
may
be
one
thing
for
quarters
of
coverage,
which
is
what
he
identified,
but
when
you're
talking
about
the
maximum
benefits
of
$50,000,
and
you're
talking
about
incomes
that
well
exceed
that,
how
you
treat
that
money
is
a
big,
big
difference
in
terms
of
how
it
applies
out
in
a
particular
situation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
that's
an
asymmetry
that
has
existed
for
all
time.
there's
never
been
consistency
between
income
taxes
and
social
security
taxes.
what
i'm
trying
to
do
is
say,
when
you
talk
about,
quote,
social
security
taxes,
which
defines
what
kinds
of
benefits
you're
going
to
get
and
whether
you're
entitled
to
benefits
in
any
event,
as
opposed
to
social
security
taxes
as
to
how
much
has
to
be
contributed
by
the
employer,
that
it
ought
to
be
the
same.
it
should
not
be
that
john
butcher,
for
instance--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
don't
know
that
they'll
always
be
helped.
there
are
certainly
certain
circumstances
where...
it
depends
on
how
much
income
they
had,
under
what...
at
what
point
in
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
don't
read
nierotko
as
having
given
them
that
option.
i
read
nierotko
as
saying
that,
you
know,
you
must
allocate
back.
that's
the
answer
for
back
pay,
in
order
to
do
it.
but
you
know,
if
there's
some
mechanism
in
there
for
waiving
their
rights,
i
suppose
that
may
be
true,
but
i
don't
think
you
can
analyze
the
same
language
in
the
same
statute
adopted
at
the
same
time
with
a
command
that
the
two
ought
to
be
in
conformity
to
each
other,
and
then
interpret
them
as
allowing
fundamentally
different
approaches,
and
that
goes
to
the
core
of
the
question
of
administrative
ease.
let's
be
clear
about
this,
there
is
an
entire
set
of
accounting
rules
for
social
security
that
exist
today,
and
a
complete
set
of
accounting
rules
that
apply
under
the
irs,
and
as
i
understand
the
government's
position,
social
security
is
absolutely
right
in
its
interpretation
of
what's
required
here,
so
if
you're
going
to
have
consistency
in
this
approach,
the
only
way
you
can
have
consistency
is
by
moving
the
irs
over
to
the
social
security
side.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
senate
report
that
we--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--oh,
well,
the
language
in
the
act
is
wages
paid.
it's
exactly
identical
in
both
the
social
security
benefits
language
and
the
social
security...
excuse
me,
under
the
tax
provision
itself.
wages
paid
is
the
operative
language
and,
as
i
understand
the
government
today,
they
concede
that's
the
key
term
that
we're
focusing
on,
and
that
language
was
used,
you
know,
with
the
express
statement
in
the
legislative
history,
that
it
was
done
for
conformity,
which
just
reinforces
what
i
think
common
sense
would
tell
us.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
justice...
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it's
on
page
21
of
our
brief.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
seems
to
me
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
hesitate
to
speculate
about
what
the
internal
revenue
service's
motive
was
here,
other
than...
i
do
think
it's
important
to
put
in
context,
remember,
the
internal
revenue...
the
government's
position
here
is,
this
doesn't
promote
fairness,
this
doesn't
promote
revenue
enhancement.
the
sole
purpose
that
they
try
to
promote
is
some
notion
of
administrative
simplicity,
and
so
they
have
a
somewhat
simpler
method
of
dealing
with
it.
it
just
happens
to
do
violence
to
core
notions
of
statutory
interpretation,
creates
two
different
schemes
of
accounting
that
every
employer
and
employee
has
to
deal
with,
and
creates
the
kinds
of
disruptions
in
the
scheme
that
we
spent
some
time
talking
about
under
the
exceptions
under
the
social
security--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
that
would...
and
that
might
be
a
colorable
argument
but
for
the
fact
that
congress,
before
the
ink
was
dried
on
nierotko,
looked
at
exactly
that
language,
adopted
exactly
that
language,
and
engrafted
it
into
the
statute
on
a
going-forward
basis,
and
so
the
notion
that
the
court
might
revisit
nierotko,
you
know,
today...
i
mean,
1)
the
government
doesn't
ask
you
to,
and
2)
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
do
that,
and
second,
i
don't
even
understand
the
government
to
be
asking
you
to
reconsider
it
on
the
benefits
side.
what
it
says
is,
you
can
have
a
tax
rule
that
goes
in
one
direction,
a
benefits
rule
that
goes
in
another
direction,
when
the
language
is
exactly
identical.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
you
know,
it's
an
interesting
question,
because
both
sides
of
the...
you
know,
the
federal
government
is
obviously
of
two
minds
on
this
score.
i'm
not
sure
who
would
have
generated
enough
momentum
in
order
to
try
to
get
it
changed
under
those
circumstances,
so
as
far
as
i
know
there
haven't
been
any
legislative
efforts.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
would
hope
that
the
court
would
rigorously
enforce
the
ruling
in
nierotko
and...
but
beyond
that,
i
think
you
get
more
mileage
in
this
particular
context,
because
congress
in
1946
ratified
nierotko
and
implemented
it
on
a
going-forward
basis,
so,
i
mean,
i
don't
think
there's
a...
i
don't
understand
the
government
to
be
arguing
that
we
ought
to
revisit
nierotko
at
this
particular--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
don't
think
i
appreciated
that
till
today.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
predated
chevron,
too.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
sure.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
of
the
1946
amendments,
and
for
exactly
the
reason
you
identified.
nierotko
is
a
famous
case.
congress,
seven
months
after
the
1946
famous
nierotko
decision--
[laughter]
--comes
back
to
this
same
tax-benefits
position,
uses
exactly
that
language.
what
could
congress
have
meant?
it
clearly
didn't
mean
to
overrule
nierotko
on
the
benefits
side,
and
it
says
it
wants
the
tax
side
to
conform
to
it.
so
in
1946,
