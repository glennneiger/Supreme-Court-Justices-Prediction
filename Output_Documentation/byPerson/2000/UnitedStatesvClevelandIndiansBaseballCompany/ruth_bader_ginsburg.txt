justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
federal
insurance
contributions
act
or
fica
and
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act,
futa,
imposed
taxes
on
employee
wages
to
fund
social
security,
medicare,
and
unemployment
compensation
programs.
this
case
concerns
the
application
of
those
taxes
to
backpay
awards.
the
essential
facts,
the
cleveland
indians
settled
the
controversy
with
certain
baseball
players
by
paying
them
back
wages
in
1994.
those
wages
should
have
been
paid
in
1986
and
1987.
the
internal
revenue
service
maintains
that
the
cleveland
indians
must
pay
the
taxes
according
to
the
rates
in
effect
in
1994,
the
cleveland
indians
and
players
on
the
other
hand
say,
the
years
1986
and
1987
are
determinative.
in
those
years
as
you
may
already
have
gleamed
tax
rates
and
the
amount
of
wages
subject
to
the
tax
were
lower.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
ruled
in
the
cleveland
indians'
favor
holding
that
1986
and
1987
were
the
proper
references
which
meant
that
the
baseball
company
owed
no
fica
and
futa
taxes
on
the
backpay
and
would
qualify
for
a
sizeable
refund.
other
courts
of
appeals
in
other
cases
however
have
upheld
the
internal
revenue
service
position
that
the
year
of
actual
payment,
year
1994
is
the
year
that
counts
in
determining
tax
rates
and
the
amount
of
wages
subject
to
tax.
using
1994
tax
rates
and
wage
basis,
the
total
on
cleveland
indians
exceeded
a
$100,000.
we
do
not
find
a
clear
and
certain
answer
in
the
text
of
the
governing
internal
revenue
cpde
provisions.
those
provisions
state
simply
that
fica
and
futa
taxes
are
levied
on
“wages
paid
during
a
calendar
year”.
our
own
case
law
concerning
the
treatment
of
backpay
for
employee
benefit
eligibility
purposes
indicates
that
the
word
formulation
congress
used,
“wages
paid
during
the
calendar
year”
does
not
have
a
dispositively
plain
meaning.
we
are
satisfied
however
that
the
internal
revenue
service
reading
of
the
tax
code
provision
is
reasonable.
that
reading
reflecting
a
long
standing
treasury
regulations
and
rulings
interpreting
the
regulation
have
been
consistently
maintained
by
the
service,
using
rates
and
wage
bases
effective
in
the
years
in
which
the
back
wages
are
actually
paid
does
not
strain
the
statute’s
text
and
serves
to
reduce
complexity
in
administering
the
fica
and
futa
tax
schemes.
according
due
respect
to
the
secretary’s
steady
construction,
we
hold
that
back
wages
are
subject
to
fica
and
futa
taxes
prescribed
for
the
year
in
which
the
wages
are
in
fact
paid.
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
sixth
circuit.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
