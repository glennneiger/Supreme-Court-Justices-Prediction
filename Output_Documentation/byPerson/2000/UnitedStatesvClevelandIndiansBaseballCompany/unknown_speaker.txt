unknown
speaker
you
know,
i
have
just
one
big
problem
with
your
case,
and
that
is
the
case
from
this
court
dealing
not
with
the
taxability,
but
with
the
calculation
of
benefits
under
statutes
using
the
very
same
language,
where
we
look
back
at
the
year
when
it
should
have
been
paid
in
calculating
benefits,
and
your
opponent
is
going
to
say,
and
has
said
in
the
brief,
that
it
will
cause
lots
of
disruption
if
we
were
to
adopt
your
view
in
that
area.
can
you
have
these
statutes
using
the
very
same
language
and
have
a
different
interpretation
for
calculating
benefits
than
you
do
for
taxing--
unknown
speaker
--the
wages?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
they
both
have
language
referring
to
wages
paid.
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
in
answer
to
my
question,
are
you
taking
the
view
that
we
can
leave
that
the
way
it
is
and
calculate
benefits--
unknown
speaker
--the
way
nierotko
suggests
and
not
be
disturbed
by
the
fact
that
it's
a
different
view
here?
unknown
speaker
don't
those
records
have
to
be
kept
for
social
security
allocation
purposes,
so
the
employer...
to
determine
quarters
of
coverage,
would
have
to
supply
those
records
to
the
social
security
administration.
unknown
speaker
but
my
question
really
is,
are
you
taking
a
position
that
the
provisions,
the
fica
and
futa,
however
you
pronounce
it,
that
those
provisions
dictate
the
position
that
the
government
is
taking,
or
are
you
saying,
yeah,
they
could
have
gone
for
symmetry
with
nierotko,
but
this
statute
could
go
either
way,
and
our
consistent
interpretation,
the
service's
consistent
interpretation
has
been
when
it's
paid
is
when
it's
income?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
nierotko
was
wrongly
decided?
you
don't
ask
us
to
change
it.
unknown
speaker
but
none
of
the
statutory
changes
address
this
point
specifically.
unknown
speaker
it
is
certainly
unambiguous
with
respect
to
the
normal
payment
of
wages
in
accordance
with
whatever
the
wage
contract
is,
but
if
we
take
the
position,
and
i
will
confess
that
i...
i'm
inclined
to,
and
that's
what
i
want
you
to
address.
if
we
take
the
position
that
the
statute
simply
does
not
address
the
problem
that
we've
got
here...
it
addressed
the
problem
of
accrual
versus
cash
methods
when
you're
doing
your
taxing
in
the
normal
course,
but
it
doesn't
address
the,
in
effect
the
back-wage
problem,
if
we
take
that
position,
why
isn't
it
sensible
for
us
to
say
the
normal,
bedrock
philosophy
of
remedial
orders
is
to
put
the
wronged
party
in
the
position
that
the
wronged
party
would
have
been
in
if,
in
fact,
the
defendant
has
acted
as
the
defendant
should
have,
and
if
we
take
that
position,
then
we're
going
to,
in
effect,
find
the
wages
payable
for
these
various
tax
purposes
when
they
should
have
been
paid.
unknown
speaker
right.
the
government
is
a
neutral
party
so
far
as
that's
concerned.
unknown
speaker
but
why
should
a
neutral
party,
in
effect,
have
a...
in
effect
a
different
rule
for
its
taxation
from
the
rule
which
in
effect
determines
the
relationships
of
the
two
parties
to
the
litigation?
why
should
we
have
disparate
rules?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--but
what
is...
i...
we
don't
have
the
same
problem
of
administration
when
we
look
back
with
back
pay
and
say
when
it
should
have...
when
should
it
have
been
paid
that
we
have
when
congress
was
addressing
the
problem
in
1939,
which
was
an
accrual
kind
of
problem
in
which
the
taxes
are
due
on
wages
before
the
wages
are
actually
paid.
i
mean,
those
are
entirely
different
administrative
problems.
i
guess
i
don't
really
see
what
the
administrative
problem
is
in
the
back
pay
context.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the--
unknown
speaker
--take
this
case.
take
this
case.
what
is
the
problem
in
this
case?
these
people
weren't
being
paid
for
doing
piecework.
they
were
being
paid
a
salary
under
a
contract
which,
at
least
so
far
as
the
briefs
indicated,
would
call
for
regular
wage
payments,
so
i
don't
see
any
administrative
problem
in
applying
the
respondent's
rule
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
have
any
reason
to
believe
it
would
be
difficult
to
develop
that?
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
that--
unknown
speaker
--but
isn't
that
what
is
determined
in
effect
in
the
contract
actions
that
result
in
the
judgments
of
back
pay?
in
other
words,
don't...
at
the
time,
as
it
were,
the
parties
in
the
government
confront
the
problem
that
you
raise,
haven't
they
in
the
normal
course
already
confronted
that
problem
in
the
lawsuit
which
results
in
the
back-pay
award?
unknown
speaker
on
the
income
tax
side,
the
back-pay
award
itself--
unknown
speaker
--back
pay
was
attributable
to
'86,
'87,
but
it's
paid
in
'94.
for
income
tax
purposes,
nowadays
it's
'94
income,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
for
the
employer's
deduction,
i
wanted
to
ask.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
the
employer
gets
a
deduction
for
the
fica
and
the
futa.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
we
have
three
arguments.
we
have
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
as
to
which
you
have
the
slight
edge.
you
have
thee
nierotko,
which
obviously
the
respondents
do,
and
in
the
middle
ground
you
have
the
ease
of
administration,
and
i
can't
quite
tell
from
the
briefs,
i
think
there's
something
to
be
said
on
each
side
for
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
feldman--
--what
happens,
say,
if
it's
a
small
employer,
and
he's
just
late
on
paying
the
wage?
he
pays
it
in
january
instead
of
december.
what's
the
standard
rule
for
allocating?
do
you
just--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
feldman,
can
i
just
ask,
you
may
have
covered
this,
but
in
the
red
brief,
toward
the
end
of
the
brief,
there
were
a
lot
of
anomalous
examples.
if
you
follow
one
rule
for
benefit
purposes,
another
rule
for
tax
purposes,
you
get
a
bunch
of
anomalies
they
suggest,
and
your
response
to
all
of
that
is,
as
i
understand
it,
that's
been
true
for
40
or
50
years,
and
it
really
isn't
all
that
serious.
is
that
your
answer?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
their
position
only
applies
to
back-pay
awards,
which
usually
are...
you
do
determine
the
period
when
the
wages
should
have
been
paid
in
that
kind
of
a
context.
it's
not
just
like
the
year-end
bonus,
or
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
it
could
be
part
of
the
settlement
deal.
you
know,
you
say
this
date,
and
i'll
settle
for
a
little
less.
unknown
speaker
have
we
given
deference
to
those
regs
in
the
past?
unknown
speaker
any
distinction
between
the
extent
of
deference
to
the
treasury
regulations
and
the
revenue
ruling,
or
is
it
the
same?
unknown
speaker
but
it
didn't
say
we
give
them
the
same
deference
that
we
give
a
regulation?
unknown
speaker
treasury
regs
adopted
by...
how,
notice
and
comment
rulemaking?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it's
the
early
1940's,
it's
before
the
administrative
procedure
act,
and
they
probably
weren't
adopted
by
notice
of--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
mr....
you're
reserving,
mr.
feldman?
mr.
phillips.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
dealing,
mr.
phillips,
with
the
receipt
of
benefits
by
a...
it
was
a
beneficiary
suing.
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't
a
tax
case
at
all.
unknown
speaker
well,
just
on
this
point--
unknown
speaker
--in
other
words,
the
concept
of
back
pay
is
different
here
than
if
the
employer
is
just
late?
unknown
speaker
and
we
get--
unknown
speaker
--so
we--
unknown
speaker
--so
we
look
to
nierotko
to
determine
the
origins
of
this
phrase,
of
this
concept
of
back
pay,
or--
unknown
speaker
--it
depends
on
litigation,
or--
unknown
speaker
--why,
if
i
pay
in
january
for
something
i
should
have
paid
in
december
because
i'm
just
late,
why
isn't
that
back
pay?
unknown
speaker
i'm
just
late.
i'm...
my
bank
account
was
too
small
to
cut--
unknown
speaker
--we
just
didn't
have
the
money.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
but
my
understanding
of
the
government
tells
me
that
in
that
case
it
is
attributable
to
the
month
in
which
it
was
paid,
and
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what--
unknown
speaker
--how
employers
are
going
to
tell
the
difference
if
we
hold
for
you.
unknown
speaker
and
for
income
tax
purposes
of
the
employees,
it
would
be...
we're
talking
back
pay.
it
would
be
the
year
received?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
under
your
view,
any
late
pay
is
wrongful,
if
it
was
due.
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
just
wrongful.
it
says
improper.
unknown
speaker
wrongful
or
improper--
unknown
speaker
--yes--
unknown
speaker
--well,
but
the
point
would
be
that
the
congress
did
want
to
make
it
simpler.
unknown
speaker
congress
did
change
this
because
it
wanted
to
make
it
simple
for
people.
unknown
speaker
and
making
it
simple
for
people
you
just
look
to
the...
the
quarter
or
the
year
in
which
the
money
was
received,
and
that's
when
the
tax
is
due.
now,
if
we
adopt
your
position,
i
think
i
would
agree
with
justice
kennedy's
implication.
suddenly,
it's
not
going
to
be
so
simple
any
more,
and
it
isn't
just
an
allocation
question,
it's
also
a
question
of
what
is
it
you
allocate,
and
sometimes
you're
going
to
allocate
these
payments,
and
sometimes
you
won't
allocate
the
payments.
it
sounds
like
a
mess.
unknown
speaker
that's
the--
unknown
speaker
--no,
they
thought...
nierotko
was
very
simple,
really.
it
was
just
a
question
of
whether
or
not
people
are
covered
for
social
security
purposes.
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
terrible
if
you
said
they're
not
covered
for
social
security
purposes
simply
because
the
employer
never
paid
them
their
wages
and
they
got
it
all
in
one
lump
sum
after
they
were
50
years
old.
that
would
be
terrible.
unknown
speaker
so
of
course
you
allocate
it
back.
unknown
speaker
assuming
that
they
are
the
same.
assuming
they're
the
same.
i'm
not
positive,
but
i'll
assume
that,
all
right--
unknown
speaker
--okay.
all
right.
assuming
they
are
the
same--
unknown
speaker
--all
right.
what
about
the
other
difference
implicit
in
what
i
asked?
obviously,
where
you
have
a
social
security
statute,
and
people
are
supposed
to
be
covered,
you're
going
to
make
a
big
effort
to
allocate
this
backwards,
because
if
you
didn't,
it
would
mean
that
the
statute
wouldn't
serve
its
basic
purpose.
unknown
speaker
here,
however,
what
we
have
is
not
only
a
desire
for
administrative
simplicity,
but
we
also
have,
who
knows
where
the
chips
will
fall?
i
mean,
let
them
fall
where
they
may.
sometimes
some
employees
will
be
helped,
sometimes
others
will
be
hurt,
sometimes...
you
know,
who
knows,
and
therefore
you
don't
have
this
overriding
statutory
goal
to
get
the
backwards
allocation.
unknown
speaker
who
cares?
what's
so
important
about
having
the
coverage
question
of
what
quarters
are
covered
for
beneficiaries
and
the
tax
question
of
where
you
pay
the
ficas,
who
cares
whether
they
conform
or
not?
why
does
it
matter?
unknown
speaker
the
three
examples
you
came
up
with,
their
response
to
that
is,
each
of
them
involves,
if
you're
right,
the
government
collecting
less
money,
and
we
don't
care.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
on
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips--
unknown
speaker
--let's
assume
congress
said
that
and
meant
that
completely.
is
it...
is
mr.
feldman
correct
in
telling
us
that
despite
that
clear
statement
from
congress,
for
the
last
50
years
they've
been
doing
just
the
opposite,
and
following
one
rule
for
benefits
and
another
rule
for
taxes?
unknown
speaker
so
at
least
we
are...
what
is
called
into
question
is
a
uniform,
consistently
followed
practice
for
five
or
six
decades.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
no--
unknown
speaker
--you
disagree
with
the...
mr.
feldman
told
us
that
on
the
benefits
side
of
the
allocation
it
was
really
up
to
the
wage-earner,
could
do
it
either
way.
i
can't
imagine
why...
well,
in
my...
in...
i
think
he
told
us
first
of
all
in
most
cases
it
means
nothing
at
all.
unknown
speaker
but
there's...
if
you
would
create
a
symmetry
between
benefits
and
the
tax,
you
would
be
creating
an
asymmetry
between
the
income
taxation
of
the
back
pay
and
the
taxes
that
go
with
that--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i...
in
the
case
of
social
security
and
that
allocation,
the
employee
benefits
every
time
by
doing
it
the
way
nierotko...
the
employee
can
only
be
helped.
on
the
other
side,
sometimes
the
employees
are
helped--
unknown
speaker
--sometimes
they're
not.
unknown
speaker
but
then
mr.
feldman
tells
us
they
have
an
option,
if
it
wouldn't
work
out
for
them,
to
spread
it
back
over--
unknown
speaker
--well,
what
language,
mr.
phillips,
precisely
is
it
in
the
1946
amendments
that
you
say
insists
that
there
be
symmetry?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
the
language
in
the
act
itself.
unknown
speaker
is
that...
is
the
senate
report
cited
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
can
find
it.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
apparently
the
internal
revenue
service
didn't
read
that,
or
didn't
think
that
everybody
paid
attention
to
it,
or
what?
i--
unknown
speaker
--if
you
want
to
talk
about
violence
to
the
statute,
nierotko,
it
seems
to
me,
does
a
fair
amount
of
violence
to
the
statute,
and
i
suppose
the
question
is
whether
you're
going
to...
whether
it's
worse
to
extend
that
violence
to
both
half
of...
both
halves
of
the
statute,
or
to
leave
nierotko
where
it
is
as
a
case
that,
where
a
hard
case
made
bad
law,
taking
the
word
paid
not
to
mean
paid
in
order
to
prevent
social
security
recipients
from
being
read
out
of
the
system.
i'm
frankly
attracted
to
the
latter
approach.
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
this
dichotomy
that's
gone
on
since
1946,
has
anybody
in
congress
tried
to
straighten
this
out,
do
you
know?
has
there
ever
been
any
motion
to
clarify
this
terrible
inconsistency?
unknown
speaker
does
the
general
policy
that
underlies
their
doctrine
of
stare
decisis
have
any
bearing
on
what
we
should
do
with
this
case,
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
will
you
make
a...
like
a
quick
summary...
i'm
asking
you
repeat
yourself,
in
a
sense,
but
i...
nierotko's
a
famous
case,
and
nierotko--
unknown
speaker
--yes...
but
no,
it's
the
other
part.
it's
a
famous
case.
it
says
that...
nierotko
is
about
back
pay
being
covered
by
the
social
security
act
and,
more
importantly,
the
court
says
that
even
though
the
administrators
think
it
shouldn't
fall
within
it--
unknown
speaker
--congress
wanted
to,
so
it's
opposite
chevron.
it's
the--
unknown
speaker
--it's
always
been
interesting
for
that
reason,
so
i
just
thought,
well,
gee,
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
they're
saying
this
word,
you
know,
this
word
wages
here,
covers
back
pay.
now,
once
they
make
that
decision,
they
sweep
away
the
little
subsidiary
argument
which
is
that
it
couldn't
mean
that
because
otherwise
you'd
have
to
allocate,
and
they
say,
oh,
no,
go
allocate.
all
right.
so
i
think
of
it,
where
congress
said
that
wages
include
back
