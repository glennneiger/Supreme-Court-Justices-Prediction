mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
back
pay
for
purposes
of
the
federal
insurance
contribution
act,
known
as
fica,
and
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act,
known
as
futa,
whether
back
pay
under
those
statutes
is
taxed
in
the
amounts
applicable
to
the
year
in
which
it
was
paid,
or
the
year
in
which
it
should
have
been
paid.
in
our
view,
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
provides
a
clear
answer
to
that
question.
all
five
of
the
statutory
provisions
that
are
directly
applicable
to
this
case
base
the
tax
on,
quote,
the
wages
paid
during
the
calendar
year,
not
the
wages
that
should
have
been
paid,
or
would
have
been
paid,
or
could
have
been
paid
if
events
had
been
other
than
they
were.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
let
me
just--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
have
one
caveat
before
i
answer
the
question,
which
is,
actually
the
language
in
nobody's
view,
i
think,
is
the
same.
the
statutes
that
are
at
issue
here
were
not
at
issue
in
nierotko.
if
any
particular
language
was
being
interpreted
in
nierotko,
and
i'm
not
sure
it
was,
they
talk
about--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right,
that's
true,
but
they...
it's
slightly
different.
they
say
calendar
quarters
in
which
it
was
paid,
so
it
is
slightly
different,
even
the
provision
that
might
have
been
applicable
there,
but
beyond
that,
the
court
in
nierotko
based
its
decision
on
the
purposes
of
the
social
security
act
in
providing
security
for
people
as
they
reach
older
age
and
as
they
retire.
the
court
referred
to
that,
and
i
think
construed
the
particular
statutes
it
had
there
in
terms
of
the
statutory
scheme
in
which
it
was
found,
which
was
a
security
scheme
of
that
sort.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
actually
think
that
there's
no
problem
at
all.
in
the
first
place
i'd
point
out
that
that's
the
way
it's
been...
the
internal
revenue
service
since
the
time
of
nierotko
has
taken
the
position
that
the
wages-paid
rule
is
a
statutory
test
for
taxes.
on
the
other
hand,
the
social
security
administration
has
taken
the
view
that
at
least
for
statutory
back
pay,
which
wouldn't
apply
to
this
case,
but
at
least
for
statutory
back
pay
they
will
allocate
it
back,
and
that's
been
going
on
for
60
years,
and
it
hasn't
caused
an
enormous
problem.
in
fact,
it's
caused
no
problem
at
all.
as
far
as
the
specific...
i
mean,
i
could
go
through
some
of
the
specific
examples
of
problems
that
respondents
say
would
be
caused
in
the
statute
by
their
view.
for
example,
there
is
a...
an
exclusion
from
wages
for
money
that's
paid
to
somebody
more
than
six...
on
disability,
for
disability
more
than
6
months
after
the
person...
the
employee
stopped
working
for
the
employer.
well,
i
don't
see
any
problem
that
is
created
by
applying
the
wages
paid
for
taxes
to
that
payment.
in
fact,
the
problem
would
be
created
quite
the
contrary.
under
the
wages-paid
rule,
you
look,
you
count
6
months
after
the
employee
stopped
working,
which
is
what
congress
wanted
to
do.
payments
made
after
that
date
are
not
taxed.
payments
made
before
that
date
are
taxed.
under
respondent's
view,
you'd
have
to
take
all
the
payments
that
were
made
after
that
date
and
try
to
figure
out
whether
they
should
have
been
paid,
should
they
have
been
paid
earlier
or
should
they
have
been
paid
later.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
not
quite.
the
social
security...
the
issue
arises,
i
would
say,
with
less
intensity
and
frequency
in
social
security
for
a
number
of
reasons.
one
is
that
as
a
social
security...
under
the
social
security
scheme,
they
essentially
permit
you
either...
your
choice,
option
of
either
going
back
or
using
the
wages-paid
rule,
and
therefore
a
lot
of
cases,
since
you
have
a
choice
a
lot
of
cases
don't
even
arise,
because
they
just
use
the
wages-paid
rule.
secondly,
under
the
social
security
scheme,
because
of
the
way
that
scheme
works,
it's
a
lot
less
significant,
the
allocation
decision.
under
social
security,
all
you
need
is
40
quarters
of
coverage
in
order
to
be
a
fully-insured
individual,
and
most
people
already
have
that,
and
it
doesn't
really
matter
whether
it's
in
the
quarter
that
it
would
be
paid
or
the
quarter,
or
some
other
quarter
it's
allocated
to.
in
addition,
under
the
social
security
scheme,
your
benefits
are
based
essentially
on
your
average
annual
earnings.
that's
the
way
they're
currently
calculated.
it's
just
an
average
annual
earnings.
it
doesn't
really
matter
where
you
allocate
the
wages,
it
won't
make
much
difference
for
most
people's
social
security,
because
you're
taking
an
average
anyhow
over
some
many-year
period
of
time,
usually.
now,
i'm
not
saying
it
will
never
make
a
difference,
but
the
issue
arises
much
less
sharply
and
with
much
less
frequency
in
the
social
security
context,
but
in
any
event--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
i
think
the
wages-paid
language
in
fica
and
futi...
futa
is
entirely
unambiguous.
it
says,
wages
paid
during
the
particular
year,
and
i
think
that
that
ends
the
question
as
far
as
fica
and
futa
goes.
the
court
in
nierotko
adopted
a
different
construction
of
somewhat
different
language
in
the
social
security
act.
i
think
the
fairest
reading
of
nierotko
is
probably
that
the
court
felt
that
this
was
not...
didn't
tie
it
to
any
particular...
the
allocation
question...
didbn't
tie
to
any
particular
language,
but
just
decided
that
an
exception
of
this
sort
was
necessary
to
accomplish
the
purposes
of
the
social
security
act.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
we
don't.
it
was
a
statutory
decision,
and
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
basis
to
overrule
it.
i
think
that
they...
the
court
didn't
give
any
explanation
of
how
it
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
you
have
to
allocate
back
based
on
any
particular
language
of
the
statute,
and
that's
one
reason
why
i
think
the
best
reading
of
nierotko
is
that
the
court
was
just
adopting
a
kind
of
extrastatutory
exception,
and
saying,
given
the
purposes
of
the
social
security
act
and
providing
security
for
people
so
that
they'll
know
they'll
get
the
funds
and
won't
descend
into
poverty
as
they
get
older,
given
those
purposes,
this
is
really
the
only
way
to
do
it
for
those
purposes.
the
court
did
not
look
at
the
specific
language
of
the
statutes
here,
or
the
specific
changes
that
those
statutes
had
gone
through
to
arrive
at
that
language.
originally
in
1935,
in
the
1935
act,
the
fica,
what
became
fica
and
futa...
it
was
actually
all
part
of
the
social
security
act...
those
taxes
were
based
on
wages
paid
for
employment
during
a
year.
that
meant,
and
everybody
agreed
at
that
time,
you
had
to
look
at
when
the
employment
occurred,
not
when
the
wages
were
paid.
that
scheme
was
in
effect
for
a
few
years
and
the
1939
congress
saw
that
it
caused
confusion
and
difficulties
and
said,
we
have
to
change
this,
because
we
don't
want
to
have
to...
it's
easy
to
figure
out
when
somebody
was
paid.
indeed,
in
this
case
they
stipulated
that
they
were
paid
in
march
of
1994
and
usually
that's
a
question
that
doesn't
cause
any
problem,
so
we're
going
to
base
the
taxes
in
1939
on
the
wages
paid.
now,
in
1946,
congress
extended
that
to
the
wage-base
provision,
so
by
1946
everything
was
in
line
to
avoid
the
kind
of
confusions
and
uncertainty
that
were
caused
by
having
to
look
and
see
when
the
employment
was
performed.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think,
quite
to
the
contrary,
i
think
they
do.
i
think
changing...
because
i
think
changes
to
wages
paid
was
an
unambiguous
change
that
required
that
the
tax
be
based
on
whether--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
don't
think
that
that's
the...
that
is
the
philosophy
when
you
have
litigation
between
the
wrongdoer
and
the
wronged
party.
i
don't
think
that
that's
a
part
of
the
philosophy
of
the
tax
code.
the
government
is
not
the
wrong...
the
party
that
committed
any
wrong
in
this
case
or
in
any
of
the
other
cases--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--this
question--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--because
we
know...
because
what
congress
was
looking
for
was
an
administrable
rule
to
apply
for
the
tax
system
here.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
under
respondent's
rule--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i
think
the
administrative
problem
is
that
under
the
should-have-been-paid
rule
that
respondent
advocates
there's
two
distinct
areas
of
controversy
that
don't
arise
under
the
wages-paid
rule
that's
in
the
statute.
first,
in
our
society
people
are
ordinarily
paid
for
services
performed
during
a
certain
period,
so
in
order
to
figure
out
when
wages
should
be
paid,
you
have
to
figure
out
when
the
services
were
performed,
or
for
what
period
they're
being
paid.
that's
exactly
the
inquiry
that
was
required
under
the
1935
statute--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--and
that
would
be
reinstituted
under
this
statute.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
in
every
case,
there
may
not
be
a
problem
in
every
case,
although
i
would
add,
i'm
not
sure
in
this
case
whether
it's
been
developed
when
the
wages
should
have
been
paid.
it
hasn't
been
stipulated
to--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
don't
know
what
kinds
of
arrangements
they
had,
but
some
times
employers
pay
things
early,
sometimes
they
pay
late.
there
are
many,
many
kinds
of
employment
in
this
country.
there's
casual
and
part-time
workers,
there's
commissioned
workers,
royalty-based
workers,
there's
employers
who
decide
to
pay
early
against
a
later
commission.
in
all
of
those
cases,
what
you'd
have
to
do
is
look
back
and
say,
when
was
the
work
performed,
and
when
should
have
been
in
the
ordinary
course
the
wages
paid,
and
it
offers
an
opportunity--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--a
further
opportunity--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
don't
think
that
that's
necessarily
so.
i
mean,
i
think
one
question
that
frequently,
especially
when
cases
are
settled,
and
are
not
resolved
by
a
final
judgment,
one
question
that
nobody
has
to
decide
is
when
should
the
services...
when
were
the
services
performed,
and
when
the
money
should
have
been
paid.
you're
just
paying
somebody
some
money.
you
can
tell
the
date
that
the
money
was
paid.
it's
very
easy.
but
there's
numerous
opportunities
for,
both
for
collusion
between
parties
to
say
that
it
should
have
been
paid
on
whatever
date
is
going
to
work
out
best
for
them.
there's
opportunities
for
disputes
between
employers
and
employees
about
when
the
work
was
performed,
when
the
wages
should
have
been
paid
for
that
work,
because
they...
employers
and
employees
may
themselves
have
different
interests.
there's
the
same...
it's
the
same
confusion
and
difficulty
that
congress
wanted
to
move
away
from.
under
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
for
almost
all...
at
least
on
the
individual
side,
for
almost
all
individual
taxpayers
they
pay
on
a
cash
basis,
and--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--you
know,
for
the
employer's
deduction,
it's
not
in
the
record
here,
and
i'm
not
sure
on
what
basis
the
employer
is
working,
but
since
the
employers
and
employees
have
to
be
on
the
same
year,
it
really
makes
sense
to
look
at
the
individuals,
because
we
do
know
that
the
individuals'
taxes
are
going
to
be
on
a
cash
basis.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
and
keeping
this...
keeping
the
fica
and
futa
taxes
on
the
same
basis
as
the
income
tax
also
avoids
some
further
confusion
in
these
schemes.
when
congress
enacted
the
fica
and
futa
schemes,
and
when
they
changed
it
in
1939
and
1946,
these
schemes
were
supposed
to
be
simple
and
easy
to
administer.
it
actually,
it
follows,
in
fact,
a
fortiori
from
the
fact
that
individuals
do
this
under
the
income
tax
and
nobody
disputed
that
so
far,
that
it
should
be
treated
the
same
way
under
fica
and
futa.
those
taxes
apply
usually
to
almost
all
wages.
there's
a
few...
there
are
some
exceptions,
but
very
few
people
actually
come
within
them.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
don't
really
see
anything
to
be
said,
frankly,
on
the
other
side
for
ease
of
administration.
they
argue
that
there
are
a
bunch
of
statutory...
there
are
a
bunch
of
statutory
provisions
defining
wages
and
so
on
that
would
be...
would
come
up
with
results
that
they
say
congress
wouldn't
have
wanted,
but
all
of
those
provisions
are
precisely-worded
provisions
that
tie
something
to
payments
made
during
a
certain
period
of
time,
and
congress
advisedly,
i
think,
in
adopting
those
provisions,
they
didn't
say,
well,
the
employer...
they're
not
wages,
if
the
employer
was
really
just
giving
a
gratuitous
payment,
and
so
you
have
to
look
and
see
whether
it
was
a
gratuitous
payment.
they
said,
6
months
after
the
employee
ceased
working,
if
it
comes
after,
more
than
6
months
it's
not
taxed,
if
it's
less
than
6
months
it
is
taxed.
their...
and
really
that's
very
consistent
with
the
whole
fica
and
futa
schemes,
where
these
taxes
are
not
generally
as
high
as
the
income
tax,
and
the
futa
tax
is
rather
low.
the
whole
scheme
was,
you
apply
it
from
dollar
number
1.
you
try
to
have
a
simple
rule
that's
easily
administrable.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
you
look
at
the
time
it
was
paid,
it
says
in
the
regulations.
it
say
when
it
was
actually
paid.
the
only
exception
is
constructive
payment,
which
comes
in
very
few
cases,
and
that's
where
it's
actually
available
to
the
employee
but
the
employee
didn't
pick
up
the
check
or
something.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think,
two
answers.
one
is
it
has
been
true
for
40
or
50
years,
and
it
hasn't
caused
any
major
problems,
but
second
is,
i
just
don't
think
that
there
are
anomalies,
the
anomalies
would
be
created.
let
me
take
another
example.
there's
the
example
of
a
case
where
payments
that
are
made
to
the
estate
of
someone
who's
deceased
in
the
year
after
they
died,
are
not
taxed
under
fica
and
futa,
but
if
the
payment
is
made
during
the
year...
in
the
same
year
that
they
died,
they
are
taxed
under
fica
and
futa.
that
provides
a
bright
line.
it's
easy
to
administer.
you
go,
you
look,
you
see
when
the
payment
was
made,
and
you
decide
whether
you
have
to
pay
the
fica
and
futa
taxes,
which
is
very
consistent
with
how
congress
wanted
this
scheme
to
work.
under
respondent's
scheme,
you
have
to
look
at
all
the
payments
that
were
made
after
the
year
that
the
person
died
and
try
to
see,
well,
was
there
some
reason
why
they
really
should
have
been
made
earlier,
were
they
late,
were
they
delayed,
did
the
employer
not
make
the
payment
on
time,
was
there
a
dispute,
whatever,
and
you
have
to
sort
all
that
out.
i
think
under
the
logic
of
respondent's
position,
which
is,
you're
trying
to
put
people,
the
federal
government
in
the
fica
and
futa
system
is
trying
to
put
people
in
the
same
position
they
would
have
been
if
the
taxes
had
been
paid
when
they
should
have
been,
you
have
exactly
the
reverse
problem,
too.
all
the
payments
that
were
made
during
the
year
that
the
person
died,
you
have
to
look,
well,
were
those
advance
payments,
should
they
really
have
been
made
in
the
next
year,
why
shouldn't
they
be
made
in
the
next
year,
then
they're
not
taxable,
and
i
don't
really
see
any
way
to
distinguish
between
any
of
those
cases.
i
think
congress
enacted
a
precisely
drawn
statute
here
with
carefully
drawn
provisions
that
drew
sharp
lines
and
were
easy
to
administer,
and
the
wages-paid
rule
is
the
classic
example
of
that,
because
it's...
there's
very
few
disputes
about
when
wages
are
actually
paid,
and
if
it's
applied
in
accordance
with
its
terms,
then
the
result
is
that
you
were
able
to
do
it,
and
i
don't
think
any--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
back
pay
covers...
may
cover
a
lot
of
different
situations.
i
mean,
i
guess
back
pay,
as
i
understand
the
way
they
would
use
the
word,
which
is
not
the
way
social
security
administration
views
it,
is
any
time
when
somebody
doesn't
get...
gets
paid
later
than
when
they
should
have
been,
which
it
could
be
due
to
someone's
fault,
it
could
be
due
to
no
one's
fault,
and
it
could
be
just
a
brief
delay,
it
could
be
a
long
delay,
and
when
those
cases
are
then...
a
dispute
does
arise,
a
significant
dispute,
and
you
come
to
settlement,
the
parties
can
just
then
characterize
whenever
the
wages
were
paid,
if
they
could
agree
on
that,
and
the
irs
would
have
a
very
difficult
time
disputing
any
of
that,
whereas--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right,
and
that's
exactly
the
problem,
and
in
our
view
what
congress
did
was,
enacted
a
wages-paid
rule,
and
they...
although...
and
they
were,
in
1939
and
then
when
they
completed
the
job
in
1946,
directly
addressing
the
need
to
avoid
the
kind
of
confusion
and
uncertainty
and
opportunity
for
manipulation
that
might
arise
under
a
should-have-been-paid
rule.
the...
i
would
add
that
the
provisions
at
issue
in
nierotko
at
most...
the
court
in
nierotko
did
not
discuss
or
cite
any
of
the
tax
provisions
at
issue
here.
at
the
very
most,
they
referred
to
section
209(g)
of
the
1939
act,
which
had
slightly
different
language
from
the
tax
provisions
that
are
in
issue
here,
although
i
wouldn't
make
a
big
deal
out
of
that.
it
talked
about
quarters
in
which
wages
were
paid,
rather
than
wages
paid
during
a
year,
but
it
had
slightly
different
language,
and
i
think
the
court's
whole
approach
in
nierotko
was
driven
by
its
impression
of
the
purposes,
the
need
for
security
in
an
old
age
security
system,
which
is
what
the
social
security
system
was.
it
would
be
anomalous
to
take
that
approach,
that
was
driven
by
the
purposes
of
that
system
and
was,
insofar
as
the
court
was
looking
at
language
at
all
was
driven
by
language
of
different
provisions
that
are
in
a
context
that's
talking
about
benefits
determinations
and
who's
a
fully-qualified
individual,
and
apply
it
to
the
statutes
that
are
at
issue
here,
which
talk
about
rates
of
taxation,
and
are
quite
clear
in
speaking
in
terms
of
wages
paid
during
a
particular
year.
i'd
just...
finally
i'd
add
that
the
treasury
department
by
regulation
has
for
a
very
long
time,
since
the
time
of
nierotko,
and
in
fact
even
before
that,
looking
at
some
of
the
wages,
the
rate
provisions
of
the
19...
when
they
were
changed
in
1939
has
had
a
wages-paid
rule.
it's
firmly
adhered
to
that
position.
the
treasury
regulations
give
examples
of,
right
in
the
regulations
of
cases
where
some
one
is
paid
one
year
for
services
in
the
prior
year,
and
they
say
no,
you
go,
you
look
at
when
the
wages
were
paid,
and
that
answers
all
questions.
it
doesn't
say,
you
then
look
and
see
well,
when
should
they
really
have
been
paid,
or
why
were
they
paid
late,
or
should
they
have
been
paid
later
than
they
were,
or
any
of
those
questions
that
could
arise.
the
irs,
the
treasury
regulations
also
speak
specifically
in
terms
of
wages
actually
paid.
that's
the
basis
of
the
statute.
i
don't
think
that
could
be
clearer,
although
i
think
actually
the
language
of
the
statute
is
equally
clear
and
consistent
with
that.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
treasury
regulations,
the
court
has
always
given
deference
to
treasury
regulations
construing
the
tax
code,
and
these
are
formal
regulations
that
are
in
cfr.
now,
in
addition,
they've
been...
those
regulations
have
consistently
been
applied
in
a
series
of
revenue
rulings,
including
one
in
1989,
that
specifically
applied
those
regulations
to
this
kind
of
a
case,
to
a
back-pay
case,
and
said
the
wages-paid
rule
is
the
one
that
applied.
that...
the
court
has
generally
given
deference
to
revenue
rulings.
in
the
correll
case
the
court
said
that
those
rulings
are
entitled
to
deference,
especially
in
a
case
like
this,
where
the
revenue
ruling
is
a
direct
interpretation
of
the
treasury
regulation.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
it's
the
same.
the...
i
mean,
there's
a
long
story
that's
actually
in
our
brief
about
the
history
of
revenue
rulings.
before
1961
they
were
not,
did
not
have
precedential
value,
even
within
the
treasury
department,
and
therefore
there
was
no
reason
to
give
them
deference,
and
they
weren't
accorded
deference,
and
there's
a
couple
of
decisions
of
this
court
saying
that
they
don't
get
it.
after
1961,
authority
to
issue
those
regulations,
which
had
been
vested
in
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
was
delegated
to
the
head
of
the
irs,
and
since
that
time...
and
then
this
court
in
the
correll
case,
dealing
with
one
of
the...
with
some
of
those
revenue
rulings
that
came
up
at
that
stage
said
yes,
we
give
deference
to
the
irs
revenue
rulings
because
they're
the
masters
of
the
subject.
they
have
to
deal
with
the...
deal
with
these
kinds
of
problems
on
a
daily
basis.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
was
a...
correll
was
a
pre-chevron
case,
and
so
they
didn't
talk
specifically
in
the
language
of
chevron,
but
given
the
history
of
the
delegation
by
the
secretary
of
treasury
to
the
head
of
the
irs,
i
don't
see
why
they
wouldn't
get
the
same
deference.
the
irs,
when
they
publish
revenue
rulings,
says
these
don't
have
the
full
breadth
of
scope,
because
they
generally
deal
with
just
a
narrow
issue,
and
they
don't
intend
that
they
apply
broadly
to
items
beyond
specifically
the
problem
that
they're
addressing,
but
within
that
scope,
they
should
get
exactly
the
same
deference.
but
in
any
event,
our
position
is
consistent
with,
and
really
is...
our
position
is
the
position
that's
been
in
the
treasury
department
regulations
since
19...
the
early
1940's,
and
if
there
were
any
doubt
about
what
these
provisions
mean,
those
regulations
should
be
given
effect--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes,
i'm
almost
certain.
i
mean,
these
regulations
go
back
way,
way
far.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right,
but
they've
been
repromulgated
since,
and
i'm
certain...
i
haven't
looked
at
the
federal
register,
but
i'm
certain
they
were
adopted
that
way.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
just
have
a
couple
of
brief
points.
one
is--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it
is
for
me
now,
moderately.
i
think
one
of
the
points
actually
i
wanted
to
make
is
that,
to
look
carefully
at
what
happened
in
1946.
this
court
decided
nierotko.
there's
not
a
trace
of
any
indication
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1946
amendments
that
congress
had
any
idea
that
nierotko
had
been
decided.
they
certainly
did
not
say,
we
are
trying
to
conform
anything
to
nierotko,
so
that's
the
first
point.
the
second
point
is,
what
they
did
do
there
is,
they
also
did
not
change
the
specific
provision
that
was
at
issue
in
nierotko,
which
was
a
benefits
provision.
it
was
a
definition
of
who
is
a
fully
qualified
individual.
they
didn't
change
that
at
all,
and
so
they
didn't
discuss
it.
what
they
did
change
was
the
tax
provision
for
the
wage
base,
and
that
provision
they
changed
to
move
it
to
the
wages-paid
rule,
which
they
had
started
to
bring
in
in
1939,
and
they
had
said
why
they
did
that,
to
avoid
the
confusion
and
difficulties
that
the
other
rule
had
caused.
finally,
then,
they
changed
the
wage
base
in
the
social
security
act,
which
was
not
at
issue
in
nierotko,
because
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
wage
bases.
it
had
to
do
with
who
was
a
fully
qualified...
they
changed
that,
and
they
said,
well,
we're
doing
this
just
to
conform
with
what
we've
done
with
the
tax
provisions.
i
think
if
you
put
it
all
together,
what
the
clear
intent
was,
was
to
keep
the
taxes
easily
collectible,
and
to
pursue
the
ease
of
administration
that
they
had
started
in
1939,
and
then
just
to
bring
the
social
security
wage
base
definition
in
line
with
that,
but
i
don't
think
saying
that
meant
in
any
way,
or
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
congress
thought
that
what...
if
they
were
aware
at
all
of
nierotko,
that
it
had
anything
to
do
with
taxes.
as
far
as
the
social
security...
just
two
other
very
brief
points.
one
is
that
the
social
security
publication
957
discusses
what
they...
their
method
is,
and
they
do
give
an
option,
because
they
say
you
can...
you
report
the
back
pay
on
your
w-2,
and
then
if
you
file
another
filing
allocating
it
back,
we'll
look
at
that.
if
you
don't,
you
can
just
leave
it
allocated
on
the
w-2
for
the
year
it
was
paid.
and
finally,
just
one
other
point
that
i
thought
was
interesting
is
that
the
19...
mr.
phillips
referred
to
the
1943
income
tax
provision
that
did
allow
some
attributing
back
pay
to
prior
years.
that
was
limited
to
where
it
was
15
percent
or
more
of
your
wages,
but
this
was
a
statute
which
they
enacted,
and
it's
called
section
119,
back
pay
attributable
to
prior
years,
and
it
starts
off,
if
the
amount
of
back
pay
received
or
accrued
by
an
individual,
and
so
on.
so
when
congress
wanted
to
address
the
back
pay
problem
in
the
income
tax
context,
right
around
this
time,
they
did
it,
they
did
it
in
express
language,
they
kept
that
into
effect,
in
effect
for
a
certain
number
of
years,
they
limited
it
to
where
it's
more
than
15
percent
of
the
income,
and
then
they
got
rid
of
it
when
they
found
that
that
was
too
difficult
to
work,
in,
i
think,
1961
or
so.
none
of
those
things
happened
with
respect
to,
in
1946
with
respect
to
the
nierotko
decision,
or
the
fica
and
futa
taxes
at
issue
here.
thank
you.
