mr.
alan
h.
levine
levine,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice--
this
is
a
case
concerning
congress'
power
to
allocate
dollars
in
the
federally
subsidized
legal
services
program
for
the
categories
of
civil
representation
that
congress
has
chosen
to
furnish.
under
the
rust
v.
sullivan
line
of
cases,
it
is
congress
itself
that
has
the
power
to
decide
which
policies
or
programs
it
will
promote.
it
is
not
the
participants
in
the
program,
namely
the
legal
services
lawyers,
the
grantees,
or
even
the
clients,
that
have
that
power.
here...
here,
the
government
is
acting
to
promote
its
policy
of
providing
free
legal
services
for
certain
categories
or
types
of
civil
representation,
and
it
is
the
lawyers
who
are
delivering
those
services.
what
congress
did
not
do
was
create
a
legal
services
program
to
promote
diverse
private
expression
by
legal
services
lawyers
around
the
country.
in
1996,
in
response
to
criticism
in
congress
that
the
legal
services
lawyers
had
veered
off
course
from
the
program's
original
purpose
by
participating
in
politicized
and
expensive
litigations,
a
compromise
appropriations
bill
was
enacted
to
limit
the
scope
of
the
kinds
of
civil
representations
that
would
be
funded.
specifically,
congress
decided
not
to
finance
any
longer,
litigation
to
amend
or
otherwise
challenge
the
federal
or
state
welfare
reform
system.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
yes.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
i
would
say
no,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
your
honor,
your
hypothetical
would
have
been
that
counsel
would
be
cocounsel
in
one
case
on
behalf
of
an
individual
seeking
to
obtain
benefits
under
existing
law
and
seeking
to
challenge--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--in
the
alternative.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
and
the
position
of...
i
think
the
statute
on
its
face
is
clear,
that
a
lawyer
could
not
participate
in
a
case
in
which
there
was
a
challenge
to
an
existing
federal
or
state
welfare
reform
statute.
the...
congress
made
a
determination
that
it
did
not
want
to
participate
in
funding
legal
services
for
efforts
to
challenge
existing
welfare
reform
statutes,
and
in
the
program
integrity
guidelines
that
are
set
up,
that
have
been
established
pursuant
to
the
statute
to
assure
the
independence
of
an
affiliate
organization
of
a
legal
services
program,
it
is
stressed
in
those
regulations
that
it's
very
important
that
the
legal
services
offices
funded
by
federal
legal
services
be
separate
and
distinct
from
the
other,
and
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
hypothetical
that
you're
suggesting
where
two
lawyers
essentially
are
cocounsel
for
one
client,
making
arguments
in
the
alternative
offends
that
statute--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--that's
correct.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
well,
it
seems
to
me
at
the
beginning
of
the
representation
of
an
individual
seeking
to
obtain
benefits
under
existing
law,
a
legal--
services
funded
lawyer
makes
a
determination
whether
he
can
proceed
in
the
category
of
case
to
just
seek
benefits
under
the
existing
law,
or
whether
the
arguments
that
would
be
made
on
behalf
of
his
client
would
be
in
some
prohibited
area,
and
if
it's
going
to
be
in
some
prohibited
area--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--well,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
arguments
that
a
legal
services
lawyer
makes
to
the
court
on
behalf
of
his
client
are
the
permitted
arguments
under
the
statute.
i
don't
think
a
lawyer,
unless
questioned
by
the
court,
ought
to
be
raising
with
the
court
a
hypothetical
argument
that
would
be--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
in
a
colloquy
with
the
court
with
respect
to
a
particular
claim
for
benefits
under
existing
law,
if
a
legal
services
lawyer
is
asked
questions
that
get
into,
if
you
will--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--up
front,
that
said...
the
lawyer
ought
to
be
saying
to
that
court,
if
your
honor
wants
to
pursue
that
line
of
inquiry,
i
can
answer
it
here
today--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
the
lawyer
can't
participate
in
litigation
which
is
seeking
to
amend
or
alter
the--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--statute.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
and
so--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--the
argument--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--it
seems
to
me
in
explaining
the
argument,
you
can
make
the
argument
that
i
am
making
this
argument
under
existing
law
so
that
the
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
another
argument
that
i
would
not
be
permitted
to
make.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
yes.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
well--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--it's--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--well,
there
are--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--your
honor,
the
statute
permits
a
legal
services
lawyer
to
assist
a
low
income
person
obtain
benefits
under
existing
law,
and
existing
law
under
those
circumstances
would
be
what
the
state
welfare
reform
statute
and
the
regulations
provide,
and--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--that
lawyer
cannot
make
that
argument,
and
he
shouldn't
take
the
case
in
the
first
place.
the
bulk
of--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--oh,
no.
no,
no.
that
client
would
go
and
get
another
lawyer
with
the
assistance--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--with
the
assistance
of
the
legal
services
lawyer.
if
the
legal
services
lawyer
here
makes
a
determination
that
the
case
that
ought
to
be
brought
is
one
that
would
involve
the
issues
that
justice
scalia
has
said
then
the
lawyer
would
say,
my...
i
can't--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--over--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--that's
correct.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
the
over...
well
over--
mr.
alan
h.
levine
--no.
i
mean,
it's
simply,
congress
is
deciding
to
fund
certain
categories
of
welfare
benefit
cases,
and
not
other
categories
of
cases.
mr.
alan
h.
levine
that
would
not
be
permitted
either.
that
would
be
in
the
category
of
cases
where
congress...
where
congress
has
decided
that
it
will
not
permit
challenges
to
federal
or
state
welfare
reform
systems,
and
the
purpose,
the
purpose
for
this
really
makes
sense.
at
the
same
time
that
these
funding...
that
this
appropriations
bill
was
enacted
in
1996,
congress
was
enacting
the
personal
responsibility
and
work
opportunity
statute,
and
in
that
statute
congress
basically
moved
responsibility
for
welfare
reform
from
the
federal
government
to
the
state
governments
and
invited
the
state
governments
to
develop
the
state
welfare
reform
programs
different
than
had
been
done
previously.
and
at
the
same
time,
in
the
same
congress,
congress
said
that
at
the
same
time
that
we
are
providing
this
responsibility
to
the
states,
we
are
simply
not
going
to
pay
federal
legal
services
lawyers
to
get
involved
in
the
litigation
involving
the
mosaic
and
interplay
of
the
federal
and
state
welfare
reform
systems,
and
it
made
perfect
sense.
