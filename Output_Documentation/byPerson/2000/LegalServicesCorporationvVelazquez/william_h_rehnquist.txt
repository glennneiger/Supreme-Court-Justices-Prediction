chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
99-603,
legal
services
corporation
v.
velazquez,
and
united
states
v.
velazquez.
mr.
levine.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
levine.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
know
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
a
legal
services
lawyer
under
this
statute
making
an
argument
that
a
regulation
issued
by
the
agency
is
invalid
under
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
levine.
mr.
kneedler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
neuborne,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
statute
said,
mr.
neuborne,
that
these
legal
service
lawyers
could
represent
low
income
clients
seeking
welfare
benefits,
but
they...
once
a
case
went
to
court,
they
could
not
handle
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
at
the
administrative
level,
yes--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--we
won't
fund
you
going
into
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
be
your
answer
to
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
neuborne,
rust
doesn't
say
where
the
government
wishes
to
expound
its
own...
rust
didn't
say
that
the
government
is
the
speaker.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
talking
about
the
rust
opinion...
you
say
you're
going
to
compare
two
cases
which
i
wrote,
one
of
them
being
twr--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
one
being
rust.
did
you
get
that
out
of
the
rust
opinion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
rosenberger
was
a
definite
creation
by
the
government
of
a
forum,
and
i
really
question
your
analogizing
the...
what
many
people
call
a
forum
in
court,
as
the
same
thing
as
the
government
creating
a
forum.
it
really
isn't
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there's
also
a
doctrine
from
this
court
that
municipal
corporations
created
by
the
state
can't
challenge
state
regulations.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
now,
rust
did
not
say
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
was
not
only
dictum,
but
it
said
it
might
be
a
different
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
didn't
say
that
the
opposite
rule
would
prevail.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
were.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
rust
did
not
say
it
was
the
government
speaking.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
what
rosenberger
said,
which
perhaps
you're
referring
to,
is
that
the
government
used
private
speakers
to
transmit
specific
information
pertaining
to
its
own
program.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
didn't
say
that
the
government
was
the
speaker.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
rosenberger
didn't
say
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
barnett
was
where
you
required
someone
to
affirmatively
say
something
they
didn't
believe.
i
don't
see
any
requirement
of
that
degree
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
your
status
quo
argument
is
a
very
fast,
you
know,
moving
target
too.
you
can
certainly
say
that
an
attorney
who
goes
into
court
and
urges
that
his
client
receive
a
welfare
benefit
is...
argues
to
change
the
status
quo.
the
status
quo
is
that
the
government
now
has
the
money.
he
wants
to
change
the
status
quo,
have
his
client
get
the
money.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it's
not
just
all--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
yeah,
but,
sir,
that
is
just
a
question
of
how
you
define
the
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
neuborne.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kneedler,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
the
case
is
submitted.
