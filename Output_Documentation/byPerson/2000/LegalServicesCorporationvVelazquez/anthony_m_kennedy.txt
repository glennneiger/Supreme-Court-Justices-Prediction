justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
fact,
i
take
it,
the
same
prohibition
applies
if
the
law
or
regulation
in
question
is
superseded
by
another
federal
statute,
or
inconsistent
with
the
ada,
et
cetera?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
rosenberger
i
do
think
that
the
government
wasn't
paying
for
the
speaker,
and
here
it's
paying
for
the
speaker.
on
the
other
hand,
it
seems
to
me
unlike
rust,
in
that
the
speech,
the
message,
the
communication
that's
prohibited
doesn't
contradict
the
government's
purpose
if
we
say...
and
i
don't
know
if
we
can
say,
but
if
we
were
to
say
that
this
was
an
unlimited
forum
of
some
kind,
then
we
have
to
ask
whether
or
not
this
restriction
is
reasonable,
and
i
just
don't
see
how
it's
reasonable
for
the
government
to
restrict
the
presentation
of
a
case
on
important
legal
issues
to
the
third
branch.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
a
paradigm
of
free
speech.
it's
a
petition
to
the
government.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
government
the
client?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
we
said
in
forbes,
the
public
television
case,
that
when
the
government
established
its
forum
you
have
to
give
certain
discretion
to
the
immediate
speaker
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
message.
in
that
case,
the
integrity
of
the
message
was
preserved
by
excluding
certain
views.
here,
the
necessity
is
the
argument,
the
argument
is
that
the
necessity
is
to
add
certain
speech
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
message
for
the
forum
that's
been
created.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
the
government's
lawyer,
it's
the
client's
lawyer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
would
concede
that
it's
lawful
to
prevent
the
attorney,
using
government
funds,
from
engaging
in
lobbying
activities,
or
writing
a
senator
saying
please
change
this
law
to
make
it
more
clear,
et
cetera?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
next
question
was
going
to
be,
we
then
have
to
identify
something
that
looks
like
a
forum
and
that
we
can
call
a
limited
forum.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--we
do
have
in
some
states,
the
state
of
california
i
know,
the
rule
that
an
administrative
agency
cannot
question
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
saying
it's
not
unheard
of
to
have
forums
for
the
adjudication
of
legal
issues
where
that
forum
itself
is
limited.
it's
of
course--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--not
a
federal
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
constitutional
provision
does
that
violate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
so
it's
a
free
speech
case
anyway.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
i
told
you
that
i
begin
with
the
premise
that
the
restriction
on
lawyers
lobbying
for
legislative
changes
or
writing
legislators,
et
cetera,
is
valid.
how
could
i
reach
that
conclusion
and
adopt
the
premise
you
just
suggested
to
the
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
want
you
to
assume
that
that's
a
valid
statute
and
a
valid
restriction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
i
reach
that
conclusion
and
still
adopt
the
premise
that
you
just
suggested
to
the
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
why
isn't
the
congress
a
forum,
et
cetera,
or
a
legitimate
place
to
petition,
et
cetera?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
by
enacting
the
legal
services
corporation
act,
congress
established
the
legal
services
corporation
and
that
corporation
is
referred
to
as
the
lsc.
one
of
the
lsc's
purposes
is
to
provide
funds
to
local
organizations
for
persons
unable
to
afford
legal
assistance
including,
as
particularly
relevant
for
this
case,
indigent
clients
who
need
representation
in
litigation
for
welfare
benefits.
this
case
requires
us
to
decide
whether
one
of
the
conditions
imposed
by
congress
on
use
of
lsc
funds
violates
the
first
amendment
rights
of
lsc
grantees
and
their
clients.
the
restriction
found
in
the
federal
statute
prohibits
legal
representation
funded
by
lsc
monies,
if
the
representation
involves
an
effort
to
amend
or
otherwise
challenge
existing
welfare
law.
the
restriction
prevents
an
attorney
from
arguing
to
a
court
that
a
state
statute
conflicts
with
a
federal
statute,
or
that
either
a
state
or
federal
statute
violates
the
constitution.
this
suit
was
brought
by
lawyers
as
employed
by
lsc
grantees
in
new
york
together
with
other
interested
parties;
they
sought
to
declare
the
restriction
invalid.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
approved
an
injunction
that
the
district
court
has
issued
against
enforcement
of
the
provision.
it
held
that
the
restriction
is
an
impermissible
viewpoint
based
discrimination
or
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
we
now
affirm.
the
united
states
and
lsc
rely
on
this
court’s
opinion
in
rust
versus
sullivan
as
support
for
the
lsc
program
restrictions.
in
rust
government
monies
appropriated
for
family
planning
services
could
not
be
used
in
programs
where
abortion
was
a
method
of
family
planning.
we
upheld
that
restriction
reasoning
that
congress
had
not
discriminated
against
viewpoints
on
abortion,
but
it
merely
chosen
to
fund
one
activity
to
the
exclusion
of
the
other.
neither
the
latitude
for
government
speech
nor
the
rationale
in
rust
applies
to
subsidies
for
private
speech
in
every
instance
however.
it
does
not
follow
that
viewpoint
based
restrictions
are
proper
when
the
government
does
not
itself
speak
or
subsidize
transmittal
of
the
message
it
favors,
but
instead
expends
funds
to
encourage
a
diversity
of
views
from
private
speakers.
the
lsc
program
was
designed
to
facilitate
private
speech
not
to
promote
a
governmental
message.
the
lsc
lawyer
is
not
the
government
speaker.
furthermore,
restricting
lsc
attorneys
in
presenting
arguments
to
the
courts,
distorts
the
legal
system.
interpretation
of
the
law
and
the
constitution
is
the
primary
mission
of
the
judiciary,
by
seeking
to
prohibit
the
analysis
of
certain
legal
issues
and
to
truncate
presentation
to
the
courts.
the
enactment
prohibits
speech
upon
which
courts
must
depend
for
the
proper
exercise
of
the
judicial
power.
the
restriction
on
speech
is
even
more
problematic
because
in
cases
where
the
attorney
withdraws
from
a
representation
the
client
is
unlikely
to
find
other
counsel.
the
affect
of
the
restriction
is
to
prohibit
argumentation
by
attorneys
that
existing
welfare
laws
are
unconstitutional,
even
though
the
program
was
created
for
litigation
involving
welfare,
and
even
though
the
ordinary
course
of
litigation
involves
the
expression
of
theories
by
attorneys
on
multiple
sides
of
an
issue.
the
attempted
restriction
is
designed
to
insulate
the
government’s
interpretation
of
the
constitution
from
judicial
challenge.
the
constitution
does
not
permit
the
government
to
confine
litigants
and
their
attorneys
in
this
manner.
we
must
be
vigilant
when
congress
imposes
rules
and
conditions
which
in
effect
insulate
its
own
laws
from
legitimate
judicial
challenge.
where
private
speeches
involved
even
congress’
antecedent
funding
decision
cannot
be
aimed
at
the
suppression
of
ideas,
thought
inimical
to
the
government's
own
interest.
for
the
reasons
we
have
set
forth
then
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justices
o’connor
and
thomas
joined.
