mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
as
this
court
made
clear
in
rust
v.
sullivan,
the
government...
when
the
government
appropriates
funds
to
establish
a
government
program
it
is
entitled,
within
quite
broad
limits,
to
define
the
scope
of
that
program.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
are
limits,
and
the
principal--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
only
situation
in
which
this
court
has
struck
down
a
government
funding
restriction
on
viewpoint
grounds
was
in
the
rosenberger
case,
and
in
that
case,
what
the
court
held
is,
there
the
university
had
made
funds
available
to
encourage
a
broad
diversity
of
private
expression
and
had
created
what
this
court
there
termed
a
public
forum
and
reiterated
in
the
nea
case
that--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
congress
did
not
establish
the
legal
services
corporation
and
the
program
under
it
as
a
public
forum.
for
purposes
of
forum
analysis
the
question
is
whether
the
legal
services
corporation
is
a
forum.
that
is
the
program,
because
that
was
the
program
in
the
rosenberger
case.
it
was
the
precise
expression
or
activity
that
was
funded
by,
in
that
case,
the
university's
activities,
and
it...
what
congress
did
in
the
legal
services
act
was
to
provide
for
the
furnishing
of
a
particular
professional
service,
just
like
in
rust,
the
particular
professional
service
that
is
not
the
free
expression
of
ideas
of
the
sort
that
has
been
covered
by
this
court's
free
speech
cases,
it
is
a
professional
service
in
which
there
are
submissions
made
to
a
body,
either
administrative
or
judicial
body,
under
structural,
procedural
and
substantive--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
is,
but
as
this
court
said
in
the
walters
case
and
the
yorkline
case,
the
first
amendment
really
doesn't
add
anything
to
what
has
been
the
traditional
source
of
constitutional
guidance
in
that
area,
which
has
been
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
with
all
respect--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
there
are
many
situations
in
our
legal
system
in
which
congress
has
enacted
laws
that
favor
one
litigant
over
another,
one
sort
of
claim
over
another,
the
furnishing--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
i
think
what
congress
did
here
was
say
that
a
lawyer
may
not
take
on
that
case
to
begin
with.
in
other
words--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
any
speech
that
would
happen
in
a
courtroom
first
of
all
is
not
the
lawyer's
own
self
expression.
the
lawyer
is
advancing
arguments
on
behalf
of
a
client,
and
not
as
a
public
forum
with
a
free
debate.
the
lawyer
is
making
arguments
that
have
legal
consequences.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
government
is
not
the
client,
but
what
the
government
is,
is,
it
is
the
government
that
established
the
program
and,
as
this
court
held
in
rust,
that
when
the
government
establishes
a
program,
it
is
entitled
to
encourage
certain
activities
and
not
others,
and--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
forbes
it
is
possible
to
think
of
what
was
going
on
there
as
a
debate,
and
classically
a
debate
among
candidates
about
political
issues.
we
have
never
thought
in
our
legal
system
of
a
courtroom
or
lawyers
as
engaging
in
a
public
policy
or
political
debate.
they
are--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
but
once
the
matter
has
been
reduced
out
of
the
lobbying
or
the
political
sphere
into
the
litigation
sphere,
we
have
a
set
of
procedural
and
substantive
rules
that
have
legal
consequences.
when
a
complaint
is
filed
in
court,
the
other
party
must
respond
and
the
court
will
enter
a
judgment.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
i
could
just
go
back
to
the
rust
case,
what
the
court
said
there,
and
it
is
very
similar,
because
it
had
to
do
with
the
furnishing
of
particular
services,
and
particular
types
of
expression
were
not
permitted
under
that
program.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
it
was...
i...
it
was
not--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
don't
think
that's
a
fair
characterization
of
the
program
in
rust,
and
in
fact
the
respondents
in
this
case
concede
that
the
government
was
not
the
speaker.
what
the
government
was
doing
was
paying
for
counselors
to
exercise
their
professional
judgment
in
their
interactions
with
clients.
that
did
not
lead
to
a
one
directional
urging
for
every
person
who
walked
in
the
door
to
have
family
planning.
it
was
counseling
to
help
the
client
come
to
her
own
conclusion
as
to
what
the
result
was.
it
was
professional
services,
professional
judgments
just
like
this
one
is,
and
what
the
court
said--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--some
types
of
services
are
outside
the
scope
of
the
program,
and
that's
exactly
what
congress
said
here.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
i
could
make
two
responses
to
that.
first
of
all,
in
rust
itself,
the
court
recognized
that
the
matching
funds
that
were
required
under
title
x
were
also
subject
to
the
restrictions,
and
that's
in
footnote
5
of
the
rust
decision.
but
beyond
that,
what
the
legal
services
corporation
provided
for
here
is
exactly
what
was
provided
for
in
rust,
which
was
allowing
the
recipient
to
set
up
a
separate
entity
to
engage
in
the
activities
that
could
not
be
engaged
in
by
the
recipient
itself.
the
lsc
regulations
were
patterned
directly
after
the
regulations
in
rust,
and--
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the...
it
would...
the
matter
would
have
to
be
presented
by
the
counterpart
organization.
now,
if
the...
if
the
lawyer
involved
was
a
part
time
lawyer
with
the
legal
services
funded
recipient,
and
worked
separately
for
the
other
entity,
and
there
was
the
requisite
separation
of
functions,
yes,
that
lawyer
could
present
the
arguments,
assuming
that
the
separation
requirements
were
met
in
the
other
program.
but
that...
what
the
legal
services
corporation
did
here
is
consistent
with
the
regan
decision,
with
league
of
women
voters,
and
most
significantly
with
rust,
in
providing
for
that
private
expression.
but
of
course,
that's
to
allow
for
the
recipient's
private
expression,
the
association's
private
expression.
here,
i
think
it's
also
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
vast
majority
of
the
funds,
non
lsc
funds
that
are
received,
are
also
public
funds,
the
iolta
funds,
the
state
funds,
so
we're
not
talking
about
an
entity
that
has
a
large
amount
of
private
funds
of
the
sort
a
typical
private
association
would
have.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
this
fund
does...
this
restriction
does
apply
to
state
funds.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
the
statute
does
it.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
gen
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
what
we
have
here
is
what
type...
is
a
question
concerning
what
type
of
professional
services
is
the
government
going
to
pay
for
under
a
government
program
which
is
neither
a
regulation
nor
is
it
a
funding
restriction
that
affects
private
expression
of
the
sort
that
was
involved
in
nea.
it
is
funding
professional
services.
i
also
take
substantial
issue
with
respondent's
claim
that
all
that
rust
covers
is
government
speech.
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
rust
itself
did
not
say
that,
and
this
court's
subsequent
cases
have
not
said
that.
in
the
rosenberger
case,
for
example,
in
addition
to
the
passage
the
chief
justice
quoted
about
using
private
persons
to
deliver
a
message
pertaining
to
the
government's
own
program,
on
page
630...
or
834,
the
court
further
said,
it
does
not
follow
from
the
government
speaking...
where
the
government
itself
speaks,
that
it
does
not
follow
that
viewpoint
based
restrictions
are
proper
when
the
university
does
not
itself
speak,
or
subsidized
transmittal
of
a
message
that
it
favors,
but
instead
expends
funds
to
encourage
a
diversity
of
views
from
private
speakers.
the
dichotomy
that
was
created
in
rosenberger
was
one
where
the
government
is
subsidizing
essentially
a
forum
where
the
government
gives
money
to
a
forum
and
asks
the
private
speakers
to
have
at
it
with
one
another
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
at
large,
which
is
different
from
subsidizing
a
message
the
government
favors.
here,
although
the
legal
services
lawyer
opposing
a
state
agency
may
not
be
advancing
the
government's
speech,
the
government
has
decided
that
when
it
comes
to
a
challenge
of
a
state
welfare
regulation,
that
is
not
a
message
that
the
government
favors
within
the
meaning
of
rust.
and
again,
nea
and
the
wisconsin
case
last
term
did
not
suggest
that
rust
was
limited
to
situations
where
it
is
the
government's
own
speech.
one
way
in
which
this
case
raises
even
less
of
a
first
amendment
question
than
rust
is
the
fact
that
in
rust
the
doctor
was
not
even
permitted
to
advise
the
client
where
other
services
could
be
obtained.
under
this
program,
the
legal
services
lawyer,
if
he
or
she
identifies
a
possible
challenge
to
a
statute
or
regulation,
may
tell
the
client
that,
may
refer
the
client
to
another
agency,
to
a
pro
bono
list.
every
lsc
recipient
is
required
to
have
a
private
attorney
involved
in
the
program
with
a
list
of
attorneys
to
whom
cases
may
be
referred,
so
there
is
no
gagging
of
communications
at
all.
even
though
there's
no
attorney
client
relationship,
the
lsc
fund
recipient
can
refer
the
client.
also,
in
the
context
of
litigation,
to
the
extent
the
courtroom
is
a
forum,
it's
a
forum
that
exists
independent
of
the
legal
services
corporation.
what
the
legal
services
corporation
does
is
decide
what
sorts
of
cases
are
going
to
be
funded,
and
there
isn't
enough
money
to
go
around.
congress
had
to
decide
how
those
moneys
should
be
allocated.
lawyers
do
this
all
the
time.
legal
services
recipients
do
this
all
the
time,
in
terms
of
setting
their
own
priorities.
with
respect
to
issues
concerning
challenging
the
government's
position,
one
need
look
no
further
than
sovereign
immunity
on
the
state
level
to
the
eleventh
amendment
to
recognize
that
there
are
many
situations
in
which
the
government
may
decline
to
allow
challenges
in
court
to
its
own
positions
and,
by
the
same
token,
congress
could
certainly
choose
not
to...
could
repeal
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
and
not
provide
attorney's
fees
to
people
who
want
to
sue
the
government,
even
though
it
may
provide
attorney's
fees
for
suits
against
private
parties.
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
congress
has
provided
differential
standards
for
the
award
of
attorney's
fees,
favoring
plaintiffs
in
certain
types
of
cases
like
environmental
cases
or
civil
rights
cases,
but
not
favoring
the
defendants
in
those
cases.
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
all
litigation
has
two
sides,
and
in
one
respect
could
be
viewed
as
viewpoint,
but
this
court
has
never
analyzed
regulations
on
attorney
conduct
or
the
attorney
client
relationship
in
that
way.
also,
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
this
is
an
anti
government...
a
prohibition
against
anti
government
speech,
this
is...
there's
not
a
monolithic
government
here.
this
statute
prohibits
an
lsc
recipient
from
taking
on
a
case
where
what
she
would
be
doing
would
be
challenging
a
state
regulation
as
being
in
violation
of
federal
law.
in
other
words,
it
would
be
a
situation
where
the
lawyer
might
even
be
trying
to
vindicate,
in
her
view,
what
federal
law
says
on
the
subject,
but
still
the
client
is
not,
or
the
attorney
is
not
permitted
to
take
that
on.
congress
could
reasonably
determine
in
the
allocation
of
scarce
resources
that
that
was
a
better
allocation
of
the
resources.
