justice
david
h.
souter
then,
here's
the
problem
i
have.
when
you
say
that,
or
when
the
policy
says
that
the
lawyer
can
bring
the
case
when
it
amounts
to
a
claim
under
existing
law,
i
assumed
that
that
meant
law
properly
interpreted,
but
now
you
seem
to
be
saying
in
response
to
justice
scalia
that
if
the
only
way
one
can
reach
in
effect
a
proper
interpretation
of
law
is
to
look
at
the
constitutional
problem
that
would
result
if
you
see
it
any
other
way
than
favorably
to
my
client,
the
lawyer
can't
make
that
argument--
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
the
lawyer
can't
go
to
the
point
that
justice
scalia
just
mentioned.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
therefore
seems
to
me
that
your
position
is
boiling
down
to
saying
that
existing
law
means
whatever
the
law
is,
or
only
the
law,
as
admitted
or
stipulated
to
by
the
government.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
the
government
is
saying,
well,
we're
denying
benefits
under
existing
law,
and
you're
saying,
if
existing
law
can
only
be
properly
understood
in
relation
to
the
constitutional
risks,
you
can't
understand
existing
law
in
that
way,
which
virtually
limits
the
right
of
the
government
lawyer
even
more
than
i
thought
he
was
going
to
do.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we
don't
know
what...
there's
a
question
about
what
it
does
provide,
and
the
argument
on
avoiding
constitutional
difficulty
is
an
argument
about
what
the
law
is,
what
the
law
should
be
understood
to
be,
and
that
argument,
based
on
your
answer
to
justice
scalia,
is
an
argument
that
the
lawyer
apparently
cannot
make.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
client
has
to
accept
the
interpretation
of
the
local
welfare
office
as
the
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
--unless
he
gets
outside
counsel--
justice
david
h.
souter
--oh,
i
understand
that,
but
all
i'm
saying
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
i
understand
your
position,
then
there
is
a
category
of
arguments
about
what
the
law
is,
what
the
law
should
be
understood
to
be,
that
the
legal
services
lawyer
cannot
make.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
it
does
add
something,
because
given
the
fact,
as
justice
kennedy
has
just
pointed
out,
given
the
limitations
that
this
kind
of
forum
involve
restrictions
on
relevance
and
so
on,
there
still
is
a
speech,
a
central
speech
element
in
what's
going
on
here,
and
there
is
a
general
principle,
i
think,
that
when
the
government
takes
action
to
disfavor
speech
simply
because
it
disagrees
with
the
government,
you're
getting
just
about
to
the
molten
core
of
the
first
amendment.
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
because
that's
what
the
policy
does
here,
there
would
be
a
good
reason
for
us
to
say,
we
should
not
characterize
this
as
simply
the
government
paying
for
services.
we
ought
to
characterize
it
as
a
speech
case,
because
there's
something
very
risky
going
on
when
the
government's
policy
in
effect
says,
you
can't
make
an
argument
that
disagrees
with
the
government.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that's
what
i
think
is
extra
here.
that's
why
i
think
this
is
not
merely
a
due
process
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
isn't
merely
favoring.
this
is
saying,
in
effect,
you
may
not
make
the
argument
that
the
government
is
constitutionally
wrong.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
yeah.
then
the
result
of
that
is
that
the
lawyer
may
take
on
the
case
insofar
as
it
does
not
involve
a
constitutional
challenge,
but
insofar
as
it
involves
or
could
reasonably
involve
a
challenge
to
the
law
as
being
a
constitutional
mistake,
then
the
lawyer
cannot
take
on
the
case,
which
is
another
way
of
saying
the
lawyer
cannot,
with
the
incentive
of
the
government
money,
say
that,
or
state
money,
say
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
terms
of
the
debate
by
the
lawyer
may
not
be
political,
but
the
lawyer's
raising
of
constitutional
issues
is
normally
a
direct
response
to
what,
in
fact,
is
the
result
of
a
political
debate.
so
you
can't
exclude,
in
effect,
the
significance
of
politics
from
constitutional
challenges.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
right,
but
if
i
may
just
cut
you
short
a
little
bit
on
that,
those
rules
allow
for
challenges
to
what
are
political
determinations
by
the
congress.
they
allow
challenges
to
political
results.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
was
government
expression.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
doctors,
i
thought,
were
hired
to
give
the
government's
message,
and
only
that
message,
to
the
people
that
they
counseled.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
neuborne,
i
want
to
get
you
to
state
your
first
premise,
and
i
think
it's
this,
but
if
i'm
wrong,
that's
what
i
want
to
find
out.
you've
got
one
principle.
to
state
it
crudely,
the
government
can
decide
what
to
pay
for
and
what
not
to
pay
for.
justice
david
h.
souter
you've
got
another
principle
that
says,
the
government
cannot
use
its
leverage,
whether
it
be
by
subsidization
or
otherwise,
to
engage
in
viewpoint
discrimination.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
your
basic
principle
that
whenever
a
given
set
of
facts
could
be
characterized
by
either
one
or
the
other
of
those
principles,
that
the
first
amendment
principle
always
prevails,
that
trumps
the
other
one,
that
there
always
should
be
a
choice
to
characterize
the
issue
as
a
speech
issue,
not
as
a
mere
subsidization
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
don't
you
answer
my
question?
