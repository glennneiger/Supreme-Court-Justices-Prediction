mr.
levine,
does
the
statute
at
issue
here
in
your
view
prohibit
a
legal
aid
attorney
representing
an
individual
client
from
making
a
constitutional
challenge
to
the
application
of
a
particular
welfare
law?
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it's
not
a
question...
it's
not
a
question
by
the
judge.
the
lawyer
wants
to
put
forward
a
principle
of
statutory
construction,
which
is
that
you
avoid
interpreting
the
statute
a
certain
way
if
it
would
lead
to
a
serious
constitutional
issue,
and
we
think
it
would,
says
the
lawyer.
is
that
prohibited?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
know
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
is
a
matter
of
statutory
construction--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--of
statutory
construction,
that
you
interpret
it
so
as
to
avoid
a
serious
constitutional
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
some
kind
of
viewpoint
discrimination?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
there
limits?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
are
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
wasn't
rust
a
situation
involving
some
kind
of
viewpoint
discrimination
under
your
view?
i
mean,
we
have
to
deal
with
rust.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
here
the
government
has
a
welfare
program
and
they
believe
in
it,
and
they
don't
want
it
challenged.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
unless
you
say
the
government
here,
acting
through
congress,
wants
everybody
to
say
the
welfare
laws
are
fine
as
written.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
the
message.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that's
kind
of
close
to
rust.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
it
can--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
didn't
notice
your
light
was
on.
i'm
not
going
to
ask
you.
