mr.
burt
neuborne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
principal
legal
issue
before
the
court
this
morning
is
narrow
and
precisely
tailored.
may
congress
choose
to
provide
federal
subsidies
to
a
broad
array
of
private
lawyers
in
order
to
commit
them
to
represent
poor
clients
in
litigation
in
a
particular
area
of
the
law,
in
this
case
welfare
law,
but
forbid
the
subsidized
lawyers
from
using
the
federal
funds
to
raise
any
argument
in
court
which
seeks
to
challenge
or
amend
existing
law,
for
the
extraordinary
sweep
that
the
legal
services
corporation
has
conceded
that
those
words
are
to
be
given.
in
short,
may
congress
condition
a
subsidy
to
a
lawyer
for
the
poor
on
an
explicit
requirement
that
the
subsidized
lawyer
argue
only
in
favor
of
enforcing
the
legal
status
quo
as
that
is
defined
by
the
last
regulation
to
be
issued
down
the
legal
chain,
and
not
challenging
in
any
way,
by
raising
its
constitutionality,
its
insufficiency
to
follow
statutes,
or
its
inappropriate
construction
and
creation...
yes,
sir.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes,
sir.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
general
principle
that
the
government
has
broad
power
to
determine
the
kinds
and
categories
of
cases
that
it
wishes
to
fund.
mr.
burt
neuborne
what's
wrong
with
it,
justice
scalia,
is
that
it
is
overtly
viewpoint
based.
when
the
government
simply
merges
its
idea
of
category
into
the
notion
of
whether
or
not
the
government...
a
lawyer
for
the
poor
is
to
be
permitted
to
raise
an
argument
that
challenges
the
government's
own
viewpoint
about
what
the
law
should
be,
the
government
has
simply
taken
and
broadened
a
power
of
categorization
but
used
it
to
permit
the
argument
of
one
side
of
this
question
and
not
the
argument
of
another.
mr.
burt
neuborne
with
respect,
this
is
a
unique
restriction.
this
is
the
only
restriction
that
i've
ever...
or
that
i
believe
exists,
in
which
the
government
has
said
that
you
can
represent
someone
in
court,
in
a
particular
subject
matter
area,
but
you
cannot
challenge
the
existing
legal
status
quo.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes,
but
that's
simply--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--well,
with
respect,
i
don't
believe
so,
because
all
it
does
is
impose
an
unconstitutional
condition
on
the
subsidy.
what
it
says
to
the
lawyer
and
to
the
client
is
that
it
will
give
you
this
money.
it
will
give
you
this
money
on
condition
that
there
is
to
be
no
argument
raised
in
this
case
that
challenges
the
legal
status
quo.
mr.
burt
neuborne
in
other
words,
a
categorical
restriction
saying
no
welfare
cases.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes.
mr.
burt
neuborne
that
would
be--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--that,
chief
justice,
would
be
a
very
different
case.
that--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--there
is...
it
would
depend
on
the
motive
with
which
the
restriction
was
imposed.
if
the
motive
had
been
imposed
in
order
to
weaken
the
enforcement
to
dissipate
in
legal
rights,
then
it
would
be
viewpoint
discriminatory
then.
if
the
motive--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--under
the
court's
decision
in
rust,
a
fundamental
distinction
was
raised,
and
if
i
could
compare
two
cases
that
the
chief
justice
wrote,
i
think
it
demonstrates
that.
in
tr...
in
twr,
this
court
held
that
there
is
substantial
power
to
differentiate
among
speakers
in
granting
subsidies
as
long
as
viewpoint
neutral
criteria
are
used.
in
rust,
the
court
went
one
step
further.
the
court
then
said,
where
the
government
is
in
fact
not...
is
in
fact
a
participant
in
this
speech
forum...
in
other
words,
where
the
government
wishes
to
expound
its
own
message--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--well,
my
understanding,
chief
justice,
is
that
is
the
way
the
court
has
construed
subsequent
cases.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i'm
sorry.
mr.
burt
neuborne
that'll
teach
me
to
do
that.
[laughter]
the...
as
i
read
the
rust
opinion,
and
this
is
before
rosenberger
put
the
gloss
on
it
that
i've
attempted
to
present
this
morning,
but
as
i
originally
read
the
rust
opinion,
and
as
i
believe
it's
fairly
read,
rust
was
a
case
in
which
the
government
had
a
substantive
program
with
a
particular
point
of
view
that
it
wished
to
have
disseminated
and
was
hiring
doctors
to
disseminate
that
point
of
view
and
not
the
other
point
of
view,
and
as
long
as
the
government--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--well,
but
that
point
of
view...
yes,
the
only
difference
here
is
that
the
government
does
have
a
rust
speaker
in
this
case.
the
government's
rust
speaker
in
this
case
is
the
government's
lawyer.
that's
the
government
program
that
the
government
speaks
through,
through
its
program.
what
the
government
is
attempting
to
do
here--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--no,
what
i
meant,
the
government,
the
other
lawyer
in
the
case--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--is
the
speaker
that
would
fall
within
the
rust
parameters.
that
is
a
situation
where
the
government
has
hired
somebody
to
speak
for
the
government,
to
advance
a
government
message.
what
the
government
is
attempting
to
do
here
is
to
commandeer
the
voice
of
the
other
lawyer
in
the
case
as
well,
and
this
court
has
already
unequivocally
held
that
a
subsidized
lawyer
for
the
poor
does
not
act
under
color
of
law
precisely
because
the
subsidized
lawyer
doesn't
speak
for
the
state,
may
not
be
permitted
to
even
think
about
speaking
for
the
state,
because
the
lawyer's
duty
is
to
the
client,
and
to
insulate
the
lawyer
from
the
possibility
of
being
controlled
by
the
state,
in
the...
this
court
has
held
unequivocally
that
the
lawyer
doesn't
act
under
color
of
law.
now,
if--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--yes.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes,
sir.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
what...
your
question,
but
i'll
try
to
answer
it.
my
principle
is
this--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--thank
you,
justice
stevens.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i
used
to
have
a
fantasy
saying
i
was
going
to
put
one
of
you
on
hold
while
i
answered
this
question.
[laughter]
the
question...
may
i
answer
them
in
order?
justice
souter's
question
i
think
applies
where
the
activity
itself
that
the
government
is
funding
is
so
permeated
with
first
amendment
overtones,
as
this
court
has
noted.
i
mean,
speech
in
court
on
behalf
of
a
poor
client
can
be
a
petition
to
redress
grievances.
it
is
a
forum
of
ideas.
of
course
it's
not
a
public
forum,
but
it's
a
specialized
forum
in
which
the
clash
of
ideas
is
crucially
important,
and
in
which
the
government
may
never
be
permitted
to
put
its
thumb
on
the
scales
of
those
ideas
in
an
effort
to
use
law
to
control
viewpoint,
and
the
viewpoint
here
is
the
viewpoint
of
legality.
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out
in
the
rosenberger
opinion,
when
you
exclude
an
entire
perspective
from
a
forum
you
have
skewed
that
forum
forever.
mr.
burt
neuborne
it's
not
necessarily
the
same
thing.
the
forum
in
rosenberger,
of
course,
was
the
creation
of
a
limited
public
forum
for
widespread
speech.
the
forum
that
we
have
here
is
the
creation
of
a
funding
stream
designed
to
enhance
and
permit
speech
within
a
court.
now,
that's
not
the
same
thing
as
a
public
forum.
nobody
can
walk
in
off
the
street--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--well,
unless
one
could
identify
a
forum
in
which
that
would
take
place.
i
don't
concede
that
that's
unconstitutional...
that
that's
necessarily
constitutional,
because
if
it
was
done
with
the
intention
of
making
it
difficult
to
provide
a
particular
point
of
view
to
the
government,
it
would
raise
problems.
but
for
the
purposes
of
the
argument
this
morning,
we
do
have
the
most
discrete
forum
that
you
can
think
of.
it
is
a
forum--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--well,
or,
as
you
wrote
in
arkansas
public
television,
a
private
forum,
because
in
arkansas
public
television,
which
i
believe
is
the
most
relevant
precedent,
in
arkansas
public
television,
the
court
was
confronted
with
a
forum
that
itself
had
constitutional
protection,
where
the
participants
in
that
forum,
the
public
journalists,
were
themselves
entitled
to
a
degree
of
first
amendment
protection.
and
i
think
what
this
court,
as
i
read
arkansas
public
television,
what
this
court
held
is
that
when
the
journalists
are
essentially
exercising
their
own
editorial
discretion,
when
they're
speaking
for
themselves,
then
they're
essentially
rust
participants,
and
they're
entitled
to
say
what
they
would,
to
engage
in
all
sorts
of
viewpoint
determination,
and
no
one
has
the
right,
simply
because
public
funds
are
being
used,
to
claim
that
there
is
a
command
that
other
types
of
speech
have
been
determined.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes,
but
it--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--with
respect,
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
the
government
can
say...
is
saying
you
can
go
into
this
forum
and
not
that
forum
based
on
an
effort
to
insulate
its
viewpoint
from
challenge.
it
is
the
fact
that
these
are
viewpoint
discriminatory
criteria
that
the
government
is
using
to
condition
access
to
the
forum.
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
you
can
go
into
a
courtroom
as
long
as
you
argue
in
favor
of
the
government's
status
quo.
you
cannot
enter
the
courtroom--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--if
you
argue
against
the
government's
status
quo.
mr.
burt
neuborne
no,
but--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--with
respect,
justice
scalia,
i
don't
mean
to
belabor
the
point.
the
forum
here
is
a
courtroom.
the
forum
is
one
of
the
most
traditional
places
where
ideas
are
exchanged
and
where
individuals
petition
for
redress
and
speak
on
important
issues.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i
know,
but--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--yes,
but
the--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--but
the
statute
defines
those
courtrooms.
what
the
statute
says
is,
you
can
speak
freely
in
a
forum
in
which
you
advance
the
status
quo.
you
cannot
speak
freely
in
a
forum
in
which
you
do
not.
now,
whether--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--yes,
but
of
course
that's,
one,
in
an
administrative
proceeding,
it
is
not
in
a
judicial
proceeding,
and
there's
no
effort
to
condition
a
subsidy
on
a
willingness
to
either
agree
or
not
agree
with
the
government's
status
quo.
mr.
burt
neuborne
oh,
yes.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes,
and
those
are
substantive
rules
of
law
governing
power
here,
but
here
what
the
government
has
done
is
taken
a
subsidy,
a
speech
subsidy,
a
crucially
important--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--yes,
i
mean,
could
i
just--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--it's
a
private
forum.
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
it
would.
it
would
be
unlawful
under
the--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--due
process
clause.
it
would
also
be
unlawful
under--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--we
don't.
we
urged
the
due
process
clause
below.
we
would
welcome
a
due
process
clause
decision
from
the
court.
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
i
was
going
to
answer
justice
breyer
along
those
terms.
there
is
a
powerful...
entirely
apart
from
viewpoint
discrimination,
there's
a
very
powerful,
really
two
pronged
unconstitutional
conditions
argument.
the
first
prong
of
the
unconstitutional
conditions
argument
says
that
what's
happening
here
is,
the
government's
conditioning
the
formation
of
an
attorney
client
relationship,
not
only
that,
the
formation
of
an
attorney
client
relationship
of
great
intensity,
because
it
looks
forward
to
actual
litigation
in
court.
it
is
welfare
litigation
that's
being
funded
here.
so
that
the
government
is
funding
this
intense
associational
relationship,
but
it
is
imposing
a
condition
in
which
you
waive
the
ability
to
make
certain
arguments
under
it.
in
other
words,
you
can
only
have--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--freedom
of
association.
it's
a--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--well,
it's
a
first
amendment
case,
but
it
doesn't
require
justice
breyer's
concern
about
dealing
with
forum
analysis.
it
is
a
first
amendment
case.
the
other
argument
that--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--well,
i--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--well,
that's
a
fair
critique,
but
what's
different
here
from,
say,
an
art
funding
case,
or
something
like
that,
is
here
you're
funding
an
intense
associational
relationship
that
this
court
has
already
held
is
entitled
to
protection
against
government
manipulation.
it's
the
language,
it's
the
dictum
in
rust
itself
that
said,
if
this
were
a
traditional
doctor
patient
relationship,
if
this
were
a
traditional
relationship
between
a
university
teacher
and
a
student,
and
i
believe
certainly
a
traditional
relationship
between
a
lawyer
and
a
client,
that
the
first
amendment
guarantees
a
degree
of
autonomy
to
that
relationship.
the
government
cannot,
simply
because
it's
paying
for
the
relationship--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--no,
it
was
dictum.
it
was
dictum.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes,
that's
absolutely
true,
your
honor.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
rust--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--demands
this.
i
was
simply
saying
that
in
rust
you
alluded
to
it
in
your
opinion
and
said
it
might
be
a
different
case,
and
i'm
suggesting
this
is
that
different
case.
mr.
burt
neuborne
no,
i
was
certainly
not...
i
certainly
didn't
intend
to
suggest
that
you
could
condition
restrictions
on
the
use
of
private
money
based
on
an
art
subsidy,
and
that's
the
other
unconstitutional
condition
here.
mr.
burt
neuborne
the
other
unconstitutional
condition
here
is,
it
takes
the
very
substantial...
and
i
must
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general.
it
takes
very
substantial
private
resources.
there
are
state
resources,
but
there
are
also
very
substantial
private
resources
donated
to
legal
services
offices
to
enable
them
to
provide
certain
service
to
the
poor.
it
takes
that
money,
and
it
essentially
says,
you
can't
use
that
money
to
advance
these
arguments
unless
you
set
up
an
enormously
expensive,
enormously
burdensome
separate
facility
from
which
to
carry
out
the
entity,
so
that
it
essentially
places
a
huge
burden
on
the
use
of
private
money,
and
it's
a
burden
different
from
rust,
because
the
burden
in
rust
was
a
burden
that
was
justified
because
it
was
the
government
speaking,
and
because
it
was
the
government
speaking...
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
burt
neuborne
no,
sir,
but
i'm
trying
to
distinguish
rust.
in
rust,
as
justice
kennedy
and
as
the
court
has
indicated
on
a
number
of
occasions,
there
were
at
least
three
cases
in
which
rust
has
been
explained
as
a
government
speech
case,
not
necessarily
the
government
itself.
mr.
burt
neuborne
that's
what--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--i
stand
corrected.
mr.
burt
neuborne
that's
what
i
meant.
when
the
government
has
a
substantive
message
that
it
wishes
conveyed,
and
it
either
uses
its
own
employees
or
private
people
to
do
so,
the
government
then
is
essentially
acting
as
a
participant
in
the
speech
process
and
can
engage
in
viewpoint
discrimination.
that
is
clearly
not
the
case
here.
here,
no
one
could
argue
that
a
lawyer
for
the
poor
is
somehow
disseminating
a
government
approved
set
of
information
pursuant
to
some
substantive
approach.
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
and
that's
exactly
what--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--yes.
that's
exactly
what--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--well,
but
it's
also
kind
of
close
to
barnett.
if...
to
barnett...
that
the
government
cannot...
west
virginia
v.
barnett.
the
government
simply
can't
compel
everyone
to
say
that
the
welfare
laws
are
fine
as
written,
and
they
can't
use
the
sub...
a
subsidy
to
breach
that.
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
if
you're
a
legal
services
lawyer,
you
either
stay
out
of
the
case
if
there's
an
important
constitutional
question,
or,
if
you're
going
to
take
the
case,
you
have
to
take
the
case
on
condition
that
you
don't
raise
certain
arguments
about
the
validity
of
the
government's
program.
that
essentially
silences--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--well--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--the
option
of
not
taking
the
case
is
very
difficult,
first
because
legal
services
clients,
or
welfare
clients
don't
appear
on
your
doorstep,
justice
scalia,
color
coded
by
argument.
when
you
enter
the
relationship
of
attorney
client
in
these
cases,
you
do
so
with
someone
that
appears,
you
have
to...
you
speak
to
them,
you
have
to
interview
them,
you
have
to
investigate
the
case.
it
is--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--well,
but
it--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--if
it--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--well--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--can
i
suggest
a
very
bright
line,
and
it
may
be
too
bright
a
line,
but
the
line
is
this,
and
i
think
it's
the
line
that
emerges
from
the
court's
cases.
when
it
is
a
private
speaker,
speaking
on
behalf
of
a
private
person,
and
the
speech
is
directed
to
a
forum,
in
this
case
a
courtroom,
which
is
important
for
the
clash
of
ideas,
the
government
may
not
use
viewpoint
as
a
criteria
for
determining
how
the
funds
are
going
to
be
used.
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
i...
under
those
circumstances...
you
mean
the
lawyer
lobbying
on
behalf
of
a
client--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--yes,
and
the
lawyer
can't
lobby
on
behalf
of
a
client
as
well
as
on
his
own...
on
behalf
of
his
own
beliefs.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes,
i
believe
you
could.
i
believe
you
could
first
because
of
the--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--well,
it
is,
and
i
believe
that
that
would
be
an
unconstitutional
statute.
but
i
believe
that
that
statute
does
not
require
you
to
lobby
on
one
side
of
the
issue
and
not
lobby
on
the
other.
in
other
words,
if
the
restriction
were
written,
you
can't
lobby
to
change
the
status
quo,
but
you
can
lobby
to
somehow
cement
the
status
quo,
that
would
be
a
viewpoint
based
discrimination.
mr.
burt
neuborne
if
it
is
simply
a
categorical
ban
on
all
types
of
conduct,
regardless
of
whether
it
is
viewpoint
based
or
not,
that's
a
very
different
story.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes.
mr.
burt
neuborne
in
fairness,
though,
it's
the
legal
status
quo.
it's
the
legal--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--well,
but
that's
what
the
statute
says.
the
statute
says
you
can't
go
into
court,
and
you
heard
today
the
legal
services
corporation
concede
the
enormous
reach
of
it.
you
cannot
go
into
a
court
and
challenge
whether
or
not
a
particular
regulation
or
statute
is
or
is
not
a
valid
regulation
or
statute.
you
must
take
it
as
written,
and
apply
it
as
written.
that,
i
suggest
to
you,
is
a
core
viewpoint
based
discrimination,
and
a
core
interference
with
what
attorneys
ordinarily
do
for
clients,
and
so
it
is
an
interference
with
the
autonomous
relationship,
because
it
tells
the
lawyer
what
arguments
the
lawyer
is
allowed
to
make
and
what
arguments
he's
not.
now,
if--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--it
is
not
the
viewpoint--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--well,
ginger
rogers
could
be
patriotic.
mr.
burt
neuborne
it
might
be,
sir,
yes.
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
that's
very
close
to
the
hypothetical
that
you
used
on
a
number
of
occasions
about
the
national
endowment
for
democracy.
we
don't
claim...
it
is
not
our
argument
that
just
because
you
fund
the
national
endowment
on
democracy
you
have
to
fund
the
national
endowment
on
totalitarianism.
where
the
government
sets
up
a
program
to
express
its
own
views,
the
government
has
broad
power
to
do
so,
and
during
the
war,
to
set
up
a
program
to
help
patriotism--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--well,
but
with
respect,
your
honor,
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
program
in
which
the
government...
it's
like
rust.
the
government
says
there
are
a
series
of
ideas
we
want
to
get
out
there.
those
are
good
ideas,
and
we're
prepared
to
pay
for
them,
and
we
are
prepared
to
in
a
sense
subsidize
people
to
speak
for
us,
for
the
government.
if
that's
what's
happening,
then
its
constitutional.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
what
they're
doing
is
subsidizing
large
numbers
of
private
individuals
to
speak
without
creating
a
government
program...
and
the
big
difference
here
is
pope
v.
johnson.
pope
v.
johnson
says
you
can't
think
of
a
subsidized
lawyer
as
someone
who
is
simply
parroting
the
government's
line.
mr.
burt
neuborne
no,
because
in
order
to--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--because
they're
speaking
through
a
person
who
cannot
possibly
be
thought
of
as
expressing
the
government's
view,
and
if
what
it
wishes
to
do
is
speak
through
someone
who
does
not
express
the
government
view,
it
cannot
use
viewpoint
based
criteria
for
allocating
the
subsidies.
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
he
would
be.
mr.
burt
neuborne
he
would
be.
mr.
burt
neuborne
he
would
be,
if
he
was
funded
pursuant
to
a
government
program
that
was
designed
to
foster
patriotism
during
war
as
part
of
the
government's
propaganda
apparatus.
now,
he
may
not
like
being
called
that,
but
that's
what
he
is.
mr.
burt
neuborne
and...
but
that's
very
different
from
saying
they're
going
to
fund
a
bunch
of
university
professors
to
conduct
some
research
and
then
say
to
the
university
professors,
the
only
kind
of
things
that
you
could
say
are
things
that
support
the
status
quo,
not
things
that
don't
support
the
status
quo,
because
the
university
professors
cannot
be
perceived
as
speaking
for
the
government
under
those
circumstances,
any
more
than
the
lawyer
here
can
be
seen
as
speaking
for
the
government.
the
bright
line,
the
test
that
this
court
has
set
out--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--is
a
good
test,
it
works.
i'm
sorry,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
burt
neuborne
thank
you.
the
test
that
this
court
has
set
out
is
not
a
perfect
test.
it's
hard
to
decide
whether
or
not
someone
speaks
for
the
government
or
does
not
speak
for
the
government.
in
rust,
i
think
the
court
got
it
wrong.
the
court
treated
the
doctors
as
though
they
were
speaking
for
the
government,
which
means
that
the
principle
with
rust--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--thank
you,
your
honor.
