justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--may
i
ask
a
question
about
precisely
how
that
would
operate?
let's
assume
we
had
an
attorney
who
is
funded
by
legal
services
corporation
and
is
going
to
make
just
the
argument
that
under
existing
law
and
regulation
the
client
should
receive
benefits.
that
lawyer
is
joined
by
another
lawyer
who
is
not
legal
services
funded,
and
that
lawyer
in
the
same
case,
without
using
any
legal
service
funds,
urges,
and
beyond
that,
the
existing
law,
if
it
works
to
deny
my
client
benefits,
it's
unconstitutional.
in
other
words,
i
understand
your
answer
so
far,
that
the
legal
services
corporation
lawyer
cannot
present
arguments
about
existing
law.
can
that
lawyer,
sticking
to
what
congress
says
it
will
pay
for,
present
that
part
of
the
lawsuit
while
another
lawyer
not
funded
by
legal
services
argues
questions
of
the
consistency
of
the
regulation,
of
the
statute,
questions
of
the
compatibility
of
the
statute
with
the
constitution?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
is
it
in
the
504(a)(16)
that
makes
it
clear
that
not
only
can
the
legal
services
lawyer
herself
engage
in
such
representation,
but
cannot
team
up
with
a
lawyer
who
is
not
under
that
disability?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
making
arguments
lawyers
make
all
the
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
okay,
i
understand
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes,
okay,
i
think
you've
been
very
clear
on
that.
you're
saying
the
legal
services
attorney
cannot,
in
any
way,
shape,
or
manner,
participate
in
a
lawsuit
where
anybody
makes
such
a
claim.
it's
not
just
a
limitation
on
use
of
the
funds
of
legal
services
corporation,
but
of
the
funds...
he
just
can't
participate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
other
thing
i
would
like
just
to
make
clear
on
what
is
the
factual
background,
or
what
are
the
limits
of
this
504(a)(16).
could
a
legal--
service
funded
lawyer
make
the
argument,
court,
you
must
read
the
regulation
and
statute
this
way,
because
if
you
don't,
the
regulation
will
be
under
a
statutory
cloud,
or
the
statute
would
be
under
a
constitutional
crowd...
cloud.
in
other
words,
to
urge
interpretation
of
the
governing
statute
or
regulation
to
avoid
what
the
legal
services
corporation
lawyer
tells
the
court
would
be
a
serious
constitutional
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i'm...
the
question
i'm
asking
is,
is
it
a
prohibited
area
to
say,
the
reason
why
i'm
urging
this
reading
of
the
existing
law
is,
it
would
be
under
a
constitutional
cloud
if
you
read
it
any
other
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
a
hypothetical...
not
a
hypothetical
argument.
very
often,
lawyers
urge,
and
this
court,
and
other
federal
courts
will
say
they're
going
to
read
the
statute
a
certain
way
to
avoid
a
serious
constitutional
question.
nothing
abstract
about
it.
brandeis
has
said
it,
it's
been
said
many
times
since,
that
you
read
statutes,
if
possible,
to
avoid
a
constitutional
question.
so
i'm
asking,
is
that
such
an
argument
within
the
ball
park
for
legal
services
corporation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
nothing
so
shy,
just
up
front
in
the
briefs--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
kneedler,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about...
and
you
keep
bringing
up
rust,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
whatever
else
is
wrong
with
this,
it
fails
the
line
that
runs
from
speiser
v.
randolph.
that
is,
what
you're
saying
is
not
only
can't
you
use
the
government's
money
to
speak
the
speech,
but
you
can't
use
your
private
money
to
do
it,
and
i
thought
in
all
those
cases,
the
lobbying
cases,
sure,
we
don't
have
to
pay
for
your
lobbying,
but
we
can't
stop
you
from
doing
it
with
your
own
money.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
the
same
lawyer
could
present
this...
the
argument
without
any
inhibition,
using
the
counterpart
organization.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
this
would
be
tagged
onto,
say,
state
funds,
this
restriction,
as
well
as--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
suggest
one
other
strand
that,
i
wondered
why
you
didn't
pick
it
up?
one
could
view
this
as
a
classic
unconstitutional
condition
case.
that
is,
here
we
give
you
a
pot
of
money,
like
we
give
you
whatever
the
benefit
was
in
speiser,
but
if
with
your
own
money
you're
going
to
do
what
we
don't
want
to
have
heard,
then
not
only
are
we
not
going
to
fund
that,
but
we're
going
to
pull
the
money,
and...
but
you
didn't
explicitly
argue
that,
and
i
wondered
why.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
neuborne,
i
don't
quite
understand
your
answer
to
justice
scalia,
because
i
would
have
thought
you
would
have
said
about
the
art
is,
sure,
the
government
doesn't
have
to
buy
a
painting
that
it
doesn't
like.
it
doesn't
have
to
buy
an
indecent
painting,
but
it
can
say
to
this
artist
that's
painting
on
government
funds,
it's
a
lovely
portrait,
but
with
your...
in
your
own...
for
your
own
collection,
or
for
your
other
gallery
owner,
you
can't
do
indecent
art,
and
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
