breyer
suppose
that
i
was
worried
about
the
public
forum
doctrine,
not
knowing
what
happens
if
you
start
applying
it
in
the
way
you
want,
but
suppose
i
accepted
your
argument...
this
is
all
hypothetical.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
i
accepted
your
argument--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
whatever
kind
of
a
forum.
there's
a
whole
speech
mechanism
there
that
you're
suddenly
transposing
here,
and
suppose
i
nonetheless
agreed
with
you,
for
hypothetical
sake,
that
this
is
a
very
unreasonable
thing
in
respect
to
a
client
who
may
be
entitled
to
money,
i.e.,
property
owed
by
the
government.
well,
why
wouldn't
it
be
unlawful
under
the
due
process
clause?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
it's
unlawful
under
the
due
process
clause,
why
do
we
even
have
to
get
into
this
argument?
