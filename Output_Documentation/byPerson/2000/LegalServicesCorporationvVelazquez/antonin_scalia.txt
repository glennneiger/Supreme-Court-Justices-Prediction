justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
so
i
presume
that
it
disables
him
from
undertaking
representation
in
that
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
levine,
how
could
you
possibly
represent
a
client
adequately
if
you
believe
there
is
a
serious
constitutional
question
if
the
statute
is
interpreted
a
certain
way,
and
you
make
that
argument
to
the
court,
but
then
you
don't
take
the
next
step,
which
i
have
never
seen
avoided,
moreover,
if
you
do
interpret
it
this
way,
it's
unconstitutional?
i
mean,
if
he's
going
to
make
that
argument
he
has
to
stay
out
of
the
case,
doesn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
that's
the
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
put
it
that
way,
but
you
can
just
as
readily
put
it,
may
the
government
fund
representation
in
cases
that
raise
certain
issues
and
not
fund
representation
in
cases
that
involve
other
issues.
it's
not
a
matter
of
muzzling
someone
who's
taking
on
a
case.
it's
a
matter
of
the
government
saying,
this
is
the
category
of
cases
where
we
pay
for
representation.
this
is
another
category
of
cases
where
we
don't
pay
for
representation.
we're
not
muzzling
anybody.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
wrong
with
a
category
of
case
that
involves
welfare
recipients,
but
does
not
involve
a
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
welfare
law,
or
the
validity
of
regulations
enacted
under
the
welfare
law?
what
is
wrong
with
that
as
a
category?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
favor
one
side
or
the
other.
it
just
denies
representation
in
certain
categories.
it
seems
to
me
any
category
of
case
is
viewpoint
based.
it's
hard
to
imagine
picking
out
a
category
of
case
that
doesn't
simply
eliminate
other
categories
that
have
a
particular
viewpoint.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
hasn't
said
that.
it
has
said,
you
can
represent
someone
in
court
so
long
as
it
is
a
case
that
does
not
involve
a
challenge
to
this
event.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
a
big
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
confess
to
being
really
confused
by
this
forum
discussion.
i
don't
see
the
creation
of
any
forum
here.
it
seems
to
me
the
forums
involved
are
courtrooms
that
are
deciding
particular
cases.
there
is
not
one
single
forum;
there
are
courtrooms
deciding
particular
cases.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
government
has
said,
you
can
go
into
this
forum
and
you
can't
go
into
the
other
forum.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
matter
of
discriminating
between
speakers
in
some
single
forum
that
the
government
has
invented.
justice
antonin
scalia
perhaps
so,
but
not
conditioning
access
to
a
single
forum.
they're
saying
you
can
go
into
some
forums,
and
you
can't
go
into
some
other
forums.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
so.
you
cannot
go
into
the
courtroom
if
certain
issues
are
involved.
i
don't
care
what
side
you're
on
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
not
going
to
fund
if
certain
issues
are
involved
in
the
case.
now,
there
are
other
forums
where
those
issues
aren't
involved,
and
you
can
go
into
theirs.
now,
maybe
there's
something
against
that,
but
it
seems
to
me
it
doesn't
analogize
to
creating
a
single
forum
and
then
discriminating
among
speakers
in
some
single
forum.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
all
courtrooms.
it's
only
courtrooms
involving
certain
categories
of
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
get
off
of
unconstitutional
conditions,
it
seems
to
me
you
can
convert
rust
and,
indeed,
every
government
funding
case
into
an
unconstitutional
condition
case
if
you're
of
such
a
mind.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
decides
to
fund
art.
well,
you
know,
as
a
condition
of
your
getting
this
money
you
have
to
produce
art.
you
can't
produce,
you
know,
history
or
something
else.
every
funding
you
could
character...
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
advance
the
ball
a
bit.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
don't
think
that's
an
option.
i
think
given
professional
responsibilities,
the
only
option
is
the
first.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
cannot
take
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
be
an
unintelligent
law,
then,
but
i
don't
know
that
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--has
any
bearing
upon
its
unconstitutionality.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
be
a
lot
of
trouble
to
sort
out
those
cases
that
the
government
wants
to
subsidize
and
those
cases
that
it
doesn't
want
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--maybe
it's
too
much
trouble.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
neuborne--
justice
antonin
scalia
--suppose
during
world
war
ii...
i
don't
know
if
the
government
did
this,
but
suppose
it
decided
to
subsidize
patriotic
films.
it
wanted
to
give
hollywood
producers
money
to
produce
films
that
would
buoy
up
the
spirit
of
the
american
people
during
the
war.
we
don't
want
ginger
rogers,
we
want
humphrey
bogart
and
casablanca
and
all
the
anti
nazi--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
is
that
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
can't
do
ginger
rogers
and
fred
astaire,
just
bogart,
or
you
know,
other
patriotic
type
films.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
expressing
its
own
views.
i
mean,
it's
just
a
particular
category
of
views
that
it
wants
to
subsidize.
these
aren't...
it's
not
writing
the
movies.
it
wants
patriotic
views
subsidized.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
why
can't
the
government
say
the
things
we're
interested
in
subsidizing
here
is,
where
someone
has
been
denied
benefits
to
which
he's
entitled
under
the
text,
we're
not
going
to
get
into,
you
know,
whether
the
regulations
are
okay,
or
the
statutes
are
okay.
it's
just
this
one
thing
we
want
to
subsidize.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
like
we
want
to
subsidize
patriotism,
we
don't
want
to
subsidize
ginger
rogers,
we
want
to
subsidize,
you
know,
making...
defending
claims
under
the
text
of
a
statute.
we
just
don't
want
to
go
beyond
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
think
humphrey
bogart
would
want
to
be
thought
of
as
being
a
mouthpiece
for
the
government's
view--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
the
producer
of
the
case
for
that
matter--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
the
movie.
