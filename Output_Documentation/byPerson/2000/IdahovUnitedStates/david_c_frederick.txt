mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
we
did.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
the
statutory
authority
would
have
been
under
quiet
title
principles.
this...
the
purpose
of
this
action
was
to
quiet
title
in
the
lands.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
there
certainly
are
very
serious
issues
at
stake
here.
tribal
ownership
of
the
souther...
tribal
ownership
of
the
southern
third
of
lake
coeur
d'alene
implicates
such
issues
as
the
extent
to
which
the
tribe
can
have
a
role
in
anti-pollution
measures
for
the
lake,
what
consequences
would
flow
from
pollution
of
tribally
owned
lands,
as
well
as
to
the
extent
to
which
the
tribe
could
regulate
non-indian
uses
on
the
southern
third
of
the
lake.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
it
would
have
to
work
with
the
corps
of
engineers
which
would
have
paramount
authority
under
various
laws,
but
yes,
that
would
be
one
of
the
questions.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well
under
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
the
corps
of
engineers
has
control
over
navigable
waterways.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
but
from
the
united
states'
point
of
view
one
of
the
reasons
why
this
case
is
so
important
is
because
it
involves
the
good
faith
of
the
united
states.
in
1891
when
congress
ratified
this
statute
it
ratified
understandings
that
had
been
reached
between
united
states
negotiators
and
it
is
unthinkable
that
congress
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine
would
have
conveyed
the
submerged
lands
to
all
of
the
lake
while
simultaneously
negotiating
to
ratify
an
agreement
that
would
convey
the
southern
third
to
the
tribe.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
mr.
chief
justice,
here
the
negotiating
history
makes
quite
clear
on
page
183.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
statehood
disclaimer
act,
mr.
chief
justice,
disclaims--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
recognize
that,
but
what
it
does
show
is
congress'
intent
to
ratify
the
constitution
disclaiming
that
the
state
would
not
have
any
interest
in
lands
owned
or
held
by
the
united
states...
held
by
the
tribe
until
the
united
states
extinguished
title.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
was
well-known,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
to
everyone
who
was
involved
in
the
negotiations
and
the
dealings
between
the
united
states
and
the
tribe.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
in
1889,
mr.
chief
justice,
congress
passed
a
law
that
authorized
negotiations
for
cessions
of
the
coeur
d'alene
reservation
by
the
tribe
as
such
tribe
shall
consent
to
sell.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
was
ratified
six
months
after
the
statehood
act.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
question
is
whether
congress
had
manifested
its
intent
to
defeat
state
title
and
under
alaska,
the
test
is
whether
congress
intended
to
retain
the
executive
reservation
and
knew
that
reservation
contained
submerged
lands.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
'89
act
does
that
by
showing
that
congress
recognized
the
present
reservation
which
was
the
reservation
embraced
within
the
1873
executive
order
and
the
'86
act
which
authorized
the
negotiations
for
the
lands
outside
the
present
reservation.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
as
the
executive
had
defined
it,
justice
scalia,
and
that's
the
key
point
here.
the
state
has
conceded
that
the
executive
order
reservation
is
what
it
is
and
those
boundaries
that
were
defined
in
the
geological
survey
had
angles
drawn
in
the
lake
itself,
it's
simply
not
tenable
to
suggest
that
when
the
lines
are
bent
and
a
point
is
drawn
in
the
lake
and
that
the
line
crosses
the
lake
that
the
lands
underneath
those
navigable
waters
are
not
also
included.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
in
alaska,
however,
and
the
reason
why
this
is
closer
to
alaska
than
it
is
to
utah
and
to
montana
is
that
the
line
actually
was
drawn
on
the
submerged
lands
as
it
was
in
alaska
where
the
line
was
drawn
out
in
the
coastal
waterway
area.
in
montana
the
reservation
simply
crossed
a
river,
lines
crossed
the
river
and
there
was
no
survey
in
montana
that
this
court
discusses
that
would
show
acreage
as
being
included.
in
fact,
montana
is
distinguishable
there
because
the
rights
that
were
given
by
the
treaty
of
1868
only
were
residential
rights.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
because
the
map
and
the
geological
survey
say
so.
if
i
could
direct
the
court's
attention
to
two
maps,
the
first
is
on
page
135
of
the
joint
appendix
and
in...
that
map
was
given
to
congress
in
response
to
the
senate
resolution
asking
specifically
does
the
reservation
include
the
navigable
waters.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
two
reasons,
first
the
executive
enforced
anti-liquor
prohibitions
on
indian
country
and
as
this
court
decided
in
bates
versus
clark
in
1877,
indian
country
for
purposes
of
that
law
was
defined
until
tribal
ownership
was
extinguished.
the
executive
treated
that
land
on
the
lake
as
tribal
land
for
enforcing
the
indian
country
prohibitions
on
liquor.
secondly--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
it
does
get
you
under
the
water
because
the
enforcement
was
not
occurring
on
that
sliver
of
the
lake
that
was
not
within
the
reservation.
moreover,
the
senate
said
there
are
problems
with
trespass
on
the
lake
by
whites
not
authorized
to
be
within
the
reservation
and
the
concept
of
trespass
is
traditionally
thought
of
as
ownership
of
the
property.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
and
the
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
who
owns
the
lake
and
in
1889
when
general
simpson
negotiated
with
the
tribe
they
drew
the
line
from
one
part
directly
across
the
lake
to
a
different
part
directly
across
the
lake.
that
map
which
is
set
out
at
page
202
of
the
joint
appendix--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
submerged
lands
were
important
to
the
tribe
for
a
number
of
different
reasons.
unlike
the
crow
tribe
in
montana,
this
tribe
depended
on
water
resources
and
they
recognized
the
value
of
submerged
lands
even
before
the
1873
executive
order
when
they
made
an
agreement
with
a
man
named
post
to
convey
the
river
channels
which
can
be
nothing
but
submerged
lands
for
the
purpose
of
post
building
a
mill
on
that
site.
this
tribe
harvested
water
potatoes,
it
built
fishing
weirs
that
were
affixed
to
the
submerged
lands
of
the
lake
and
the
associated
waterways
and
the
executive
knew
that.
when
they
negotiated
for
the
land,
chief
seltice
insisted
that
the
line
be
drawn
in
such
a
way
that
the
tribe
would
understand
what
was
theirs.
and
general
simpson
in
his
response
on
page
183
of
the
joint
appendix
says
quite
clearly
after
this
agreement
when
the
line
is
redrawn
you
shall
have
the
lower
part
of
the
lake.
that
could
not
be
clearer
that
the
executive
understood
that
the
submerged
lands
south
of
where
the
line
was
to
be
drawn
were
to
be
owned
by
the
tribe.
so
the
question
then
becomes
this
is
in
a
sense
an
amalgam
of
alaska
and
utah
lands
because
had
this
occurred
before
statehood
this
would
have
been
a
conveyance
case
and
the
question
would
have
been
what
did
congress
intend
by
the
conveyance.
and
i
would
direct
the
court
to
the
1987
agreement
which
we
have
set
forth
in
the--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--1887
agreement.
on
page
93
the
language
here
is
quite
clear.
it
says,
quote,
it
is
agreed
that
the
coeur
d'alene
reservation
shall
be
held
forever
as
indian
land
and
as
homes
for
the
coeur
d'alene
indians.
and
then
skipping
down
a
few
lines,
and
no
part
of
said
reservation
shall
ever
be
sold,
occupied,
open
to
white
settlement
or
otherwise
disposed
of
without
the
consent
of
the
indians
residing
on
said
reservation.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct,
justice
scalia,
but--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
scalia,
in
the
alaska
case
the
executive
had
set
apart
certain
lands
for
a
wildlife
refuge
which
had
not
been
finalized
prior
to
alaska
statehood,
but
this
court
held
that
that
executive
reservation
because
congress
understood
that
it
included
submerged
lands
and
was
to
meet
the
purposes
behind
the
reservation
defeated
the
state--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--to
the
contrary,
mr.
chief
justice.
here
the
1873
executive
order
set
apart
the
reservation.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
in
this
case
the
disclaimer
clause
says
until
the
united
states
extinguishes
title
to
lands
owned
or
held
by
indians,
the
state
of
idaho
will
disclaim
all
right
and
title
to
that
land.
the
executive
order
reservation
boundaries
were
well-known
well
before
statehood
and--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
is
proprietary
in
the
sense
of
ownership,
justice
souter.
the
fact
that
the
state
may
have
some
regulatory
interest
even
over
the
southern
third
of
the
lake
under
even
our
theory
because
under
the
mescalero
apache
indian
case
the
state
might
still
have
a
regulatory
role,
given
a
range
of
factors
that
would
be
involved
in
even
if
the
tribe
owns
the
southern
third.
but
the
important
point
is
that
we
do
know
that
it
included
submerged
lands
because
the
post,
the
frederick
post
patent
expressly
included
river
channels
which
is
submerged
lands
when
they
drew
the
harrison
cession
in
1894.
at
first
they
started
it,
it
meandered
to
the
coast
but
because
the
town
of
harrison
wanted
to
build
docks
and
wharfs,
they
redraw
the
line
at
a
right
angle
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
so
that
the
town
of
harrison
could
build
out
that
wharfage
on
to
the
submerged
lands
of
the
lake.
so
in
this
case
the
boundary
lines
are
quite
clear
that
the
parties
understood
submerged
lands
were
at
issue
and
they
drew
the
lines
accordingly.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
the
language
that
is
the
disclaimer
clause
that
we
have
set
out
and
i
can
direct
the
court
to
that
language
which
we
have
put
in
the
joint
appendix,
it's
on
page...
sorry,
that
language
is
on
page
371
of
the
joint
appendix
and
it
provides
as
i
have
said,
but
i
would
point
out
that
at
this
time
idaho
had
a
number
of
indian
tribes
that
were
resident
there
and
so
it
would
be
unusual
for
a
state
and
its
constitution
to
single
out
a
particular
tribe
when
there
are
multiple
tribes,
when
the
purpose
of
this
disclaimer
clause
was
to
emphasize
that
the
state
of
idaho
would
renounce
and
forever
disclaim
all
right
and
title
to
the
unappropriated
public
lands
that
were
owned
by
the
united
states
until
such
title
had
been
extinguished
by
the
united
states.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
state...
no,
two
things,
justice
stevens.
our
theory
depends
upon
the
court
recognizing
the
executive
reservation
through
statehood
which
the
'89
act
is
clear--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that
would
have
raised
an
alaska
question
and
i
think
that
that
would
have
been
enough
in
light
of
the
executive
having
set
forth
the
boundary.
what
the
statehood
act
does
for
us
is
that
it
shows
what
congress
intended
because
congress
specifically
adopted
the
idaho
constitution
in
the
statehood
act.
so
that
is
also
an
expression
of
congressional
intent
that
congress
ratified
and
adopted
the
idaho
constitution
and
the
statehood
act
which
contained
the
disclaimer.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it's
in
the
idaho
admission
bill.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
it
says
section
one,
the
state
of
idaho
is
hereby
declared
to
be
a
state
and
that
the
constitution
which
the
people
of
idaho
have
formed
or
themselves
be
in
the
same
is
hereby
accepted,
ratified,
and
confirmed.
so
congress
in
section
one
of
the
idaho
admission
act
ratified
the
idaho
constitution
which
contained
the
disclaimer
clause
language.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it's
throughout
the
lake,
although
the
principal
portion
of
the
polluted
part
is
on
the
northern
part
of
the
lake.
the
southern
part
at
least
i'm
reliably
informed,
and
this
is
matter
that's
outside
of
the
record,
is
not
as
polluted,
although
it
is
subject
to
pollution
problems
and
issues.
i
would
like
to
just
make
a
couple
of
points
in
conclusion
and
that
is
the
idaho
issue
in
terms
of
submerged
lands
is
also
implicated
by
the
1888
railroad
statute
which
congress
passed
and
that
passage
which
came
after
the
senate
resolution
asking
about
the
navigable
waters
included
a
right
of
way
that
crossed
across
lake
coeur
d'alene
to
a
point
on
the
lake
itself
and
requires
that
the
secretary
provide
compensation
to
the
tribe
for
that
easement
and
it
further
provided
that
no
rights
for
the
railroad
shall
accrue
unless
and
until
they
obtained
the
consent
of
the
tribe.
so
read
together
and
this
court's
cases
makes
very
clear
two
overarching
propositions,
that
these
indian
statutes
should
be
read
as
a
series
and
that
doubts
should
be
construed
in
favor
of
the
tribe
suggest
that
congress
did
understand
that
the
submerged
lands
were
at
stake,
that
the
tribe
had
control
over
those
submerged
lands
and
that
the
united
states
would
not
take
them
without
the
consent
of
the
tribe.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
