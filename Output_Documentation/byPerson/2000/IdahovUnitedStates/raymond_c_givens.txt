mr.
raymond
c.
givens
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
six
prestatehood
acts
of
congress
or
items
that
occurred
that
congress
was
specifically
informed
of
that
establish
that
the
state
title
to
these
submerged
lands
was
defeated
at
statehood.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
oh,
yes
they
did.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
some
are
and
some
are
information
provided
to
congress
that
form
the
basis
for
those
congressional
acts,
your
honor.
let
me
run
through
them
briefly.
i
think--
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
--it
will
become
clear.
the
first
is
the
1873
agreement,
executive
order,
and
the
reports
of
that.
the
executive
order,
of
course,
established
the
reservation,
withdrew
it
and
set
it
apart,
set
the
boundaries
and
the
reports
provided
that
information
to
congress.
so
congress
knew
about
it
from
the
beginning.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
your
honor,
congress
as
an
institution
had
knowledge
of
the
reservation
and
the
specific--
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
--because
in--
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
--well,
what
is
important,
your
honor,
is
that
in
the
later
acts
congress
by
statute
specifically
referred
to
three
times
before
statehood
either
the
coeur
d'alene
reservation,
the
present
coeur
d'alene
reservation
or
talking
about
the
tribe
and
its
reservation,
so
congress
knew
of
the
reservation
and
they
knew
of
it
because
of
the
second
one
your
honor,
and
that
was
the
1883
survey
and
plat
of
the
reservation
which
is
at
page
49
of
the
record.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
they
knew
of
it,
your
honor,
because
of
the
third
one
and
the
third
one
is
in
1888
the
senate
made
specific
requests
of
the
department
of
interior
concerning
the
reservation
asking
is
the
lake
in
the
reservation,
and
if
so,
should
we
get
any
of
it
back,
and
they
were
provided,
the
department
of
interior
provided
congress
with
that
same
plat
that
showed
the
detail
of
the
lake.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
it
was
only
of
the
senate,
it
was
not
of
the
house,
but
prestatehood
the
record
also
establishes,
your
honor,
in
the
march
1890
house
report
that
the
house
also
had
knowledge
of
that
and
the
house
march
report
makes
that
clear.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
this
was
a
report
of
the
committee
on
indian
affairs
of
the
house,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
in
spending
ten
years
with
these
documents,
there
can
be
really
no
dispute
that
whether
it's
called
navigable
waters
or
submerged
lands
or
lake
just
like
it's
called
land
or
ground
or
soil
the
meaning
of
the...
was
the
same
throughout.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
yeah.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
it
is
this,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
this
survey
and
plat
is
so
important
in
that
the...
in
the
sur...
in
the
plat,
in
the
survey
they
calculated
the
actual
acreage
and
in
1888
the
department
of
interior
did
an
interesting
thing.
not
only
did
they
provide
congress
with
the
plat,
they
provided
cong...
or
the
senate
with
another
map
that
showed
the
acreage
and
actually
the
acreage
is
right
over
the
top
of
the
lake
and
this
is
at
135
of
the
record,
and
coeur
d'alene
reservation
is
written
right
through
the
lake
and
in
the
text
that
they
talk
about
of
that
'88
question
and
answer
which
is
the
third
of
these
items,
they
use
the
word
embrace
both
for
the
acreage
and
for
the
navigable
waters.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
you
get
to
that
through
the
next
three
items,
your
honor,
and
they
are
the
'89
statute
where
it
talked
about
its
reservation
and
they
knew
that
reservation
included
the
lake
because
of
the
detail
in
the
plat.
they--
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
--we
know
that
because
of
the
next
item,
your
honor,
and
that
was
the
two
reports
in
1890,
and
particularly
the
first
one
from
the
commissioner
that
said
that
the
united
states
got
back
most
of
the
lake
but
specifically
the
executive
specific
report
on
these
negotiations
that
included
a
map
again,
a
second
map
showing
the
reservation
boundary
dotted
line
crossing
the
lake
showing
that
these
submerged
lands
were
part
of
the...
more
particularly--
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
--but
then,
your
honor,
it
went
on
to
say
you
will
still
have
under
the...
if
you
take
this
agreement,
you
will
still
have
the
southern
part
of
the
lake,
i
think
it
said
the
lower
part
of
the
lake
and
the
st.
joseph
river,
you
would
still
have.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
and
at
statehood
what,
which
is
the
final
one,
or
actually
just
prior
to
statehood
the
people
of
idaho
ratified
the
idaho
constitution
which
disclaimed
any
ownership
or
any
jurisdiction
over
indian
lands
until
that
title
is
extinguished
by
congress,
so
the
title
that
had
been
the
ownership
interest
that
congress
knew
of
that
had
been
established
by
the
'73,
initially
by
the
73
executive
order,
none
of
the
coeur
d'alene
country
had
been
extinguished,
not
just--
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
--well,
one
reason
to
make
that
assumption,
your
honor,
is
the
1887
agreement
had
a
very
unusual
clause
in
it,
the
reports
from
the
negotiators
explained
it
was
so
unusual
that
the
tribe
insisted
that
the
provision
be
put
in
that
the
land
could
never
be
sold
or
otherwise
disposed
of
without
the
consent
of
the
tribe,
any
part
of
the
reservation.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
pardon?
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
'87.
article
five
of
the
'87
agreement,
which
is
equivalent
of
fee.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
it
was
not
ratified
at
the
time
of
statehood
but
what
happened
with
that
disclaimer
act
is
the
disclaimer
act
put
all
of
this
on
hold.
it
pushed
the
hold
button.
it
said
the
united
states
still
has
ownership
and
complete
jurisdiction,
absolute
jurisdiction
is
the
words
out
of
the--
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
--certainly
they
can,
but
this
is
what
idaho
did
to
itself.
idaho
itself
adopts
its
constitution
and
says
we
disclaim
it,
we
don't
have
any
jurisdiction
over
it.
mr.
raymond
c.
givens
we
know
because,
also
because
this
'87
agreement
specifically
refers
to
the
reservation
as
indian
lands
which
is
the
same
word
used
in
the
idaho
disclaimer.
