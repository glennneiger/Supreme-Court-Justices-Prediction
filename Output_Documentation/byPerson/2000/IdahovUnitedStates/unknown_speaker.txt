unknown
speaker
would
you
mind
if
i
just
get
a
little
background
that
helps
me
understand
better
the
practical
issues
involved
here.
we're
talking
about
roughly
one-third
of
the
lake,
the
submerged
lands
and
about
one-third
of
lake
coeur
d'alene;
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
about
one-fourth.
unknown
speaker
in
the
southern
part
of
the
lake?
unknown
speaker
and
what
are
the
practical
consequences
of
a
finding
one
way
or
the
other?
what
as
a
practical
matter
difference
does
it
make
who
has
the
submerged
lands.
unknown
speaker
well,
just
tell
me
what's
involved.
is
it
fishing
rights
or
regulation
of
boating,
what
is
it?
why
does
the
state
care,
what
is
involved
as
a
practical
matter.
unknown
speaker
i'll
pursue
justice
o'connor's
question,
why
can't
the
state,
why
can't
the
tribe
have
the
patrol
boat
just
like
a
tribe
has
a
patrol
car
on
the
road?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
why
can't
the
state's
boat
go
into
the
southern
part
of
the
lake?
unknown
speaker
you
can't
work...
all
this
is
about
is
whether
or
not
the
state
wants
to
have
a
policeman
in
a
boat
cite
somebody
for
not
wearing
a
life
vest
and
the
tribe
just
won't
agree
to
figuring
out
some
method
so
that
people
boat
safely?
it
sounds
like
is
that
all
that's
at
stake
and
you
can't
work
it
out
with
the
tribe?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
saying
in
principle.
i
want
to
know
what
does
this
come
down
to
as
a
practical
matter
that
has
led
the
state
of
idaho
to
say
it's
important.
i
mean
all
kinds
of
principles,
you
may
even
be
right,
they
may
be
right,
but
sometimes...
what
is
the
practical
application,
anything
else?
unknown
speaker
well,
name
one.
could
you
just
name
one.
so
far
i
have
the
fact
that
you
told
justice
o'connor
that
it's
not
been
possible
for
you
to
work
out
with
the
tribe
whether
a
policeman
could
cite
somebody
in
a
boat
for
not
wearing
a
life
jacket.
now
what's
the
next
one?
unknown
speaker
mr.
strack,
may
i
ask
that
you
raise
the
podium
a
bit
because
i'm
having
difficulty
hearing.
you're
lowering.
other
way.
there.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
the
federal
government
in
its
capacity
as
a
trustee,
if
you
will,
have
any
role
in
how
the
lake
is
managed
or
used
if
it
belongs
to
the
tribe?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
after
idaho
became
a
state,
i
think
there
were
at
least
two
conveyances
by
the
united
states
to
people
of
land
in
that
area,
one
to
frederick
post
and
the
other
to
someone
named
harrison;
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
ceded.
unknown
speaker
and
how
about
post
the
frederick
post
property.
unknown
speaker
so
is
it
your
position
that
both
of
those
are
void,
that
there
was
no
authority
because
idaho
had
already
become
a
state.
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
tribe
doesn't
own
it,
i
don't
see
how
you
could
take
the
position
that
the
conveyance
by
them
would
be
valid.
i
don't
understand.
unknown
speaker
something
they
don't
own.
unknown
speaker
you're
making
a
distinction
between
property
and
regulation
and
i
gather
from
your
answers
so
far
what
you're
saying
is
property
rights
are
not
at
stake,
only
sovereign
rights
to
police,
is
that
accurate?
unknown
speaker
what
about
as
to
sovereignty
rights?
when
you
say
jurisdictional
boundary,
i
assume
you
mean
a
boundary
of
sovereignty.
you
don't
mean
that?
unknown
speaker
you
do
mean
that.
well,
then,
that
brings
back
the
question
of
how
the
tribe
could
cede
jurisdictional
rights
without
ceding
sovereign
rights.
unknown
speaker
but
we're
not
talking
about
property
rights.
we're
talking
about
sovereignty
rights,
aren't
we?
unknown
speaker
and
you
acknowledge
that
the
consequence
of
the
cession
was
an
alteration
of
jurisdiction,
which
i
assume
is
the
same
as
an
alteration
of
sovereignty.
unknown
speaker
i
hope
so.
unknown
speaker
it
also
doesn't
apply
anything
as
to
the
tribal
sovereignty.
i
mean
that's
the
source
of
my
confusion.
you
don't
think
that
sovereignty
is
at
issue
when
there
are
just
the
fishing
rights
involved,
correct?
unknown
speaker
you
get
to
the
1899
act,
as
i
understand
it
the
premise
of
the
1899
act
was
that
the
united
states
would
not
take
any
portion
of
the
reservation
except
by
agreement;
is
that
correct.
unknown
speaker
well,
and
are
you
saying
that
the...
that
the
act
had
no
significance
for
any
other
portion
of
the
reservation?
unknown
speaker
do
we
know,
is
that
true
as
a
matter
of
law,
i
mean
couldn't
submerged
lands
also
have
mineral
deposits
or
have
been
thought
to
have
mineral
deposits
and
therefore
be
subject
to
the
purchase
power
under
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
assume
then
that
the...
that
the
act
referred
only
to
lands
that
were
not
submerged
lands.
wouldn't
it
have
been
very...
a
very
strange
construction
on
the
intentions
and
the
acts
of
the
united
states
to
assume
on
the
one
hand
that
with
respect
to
specified
kinds
of
lands,
timber
and
minerals,
it
wouldn't
touch
the
reservation
except
by
agreement,
and
at
the
same
time
assume
that
without
any
agreement
and
in
fact
without
any
express
reference,
it
was
divesting
the
tribe
of
the
submerged
lands
which
were
also
part
of
the
reservation.
wouldn't
that
have
been...
i
mean
wouldn't
anyone
looking
at
the
act
say
gee,
if
they're
not
going
to
take
timber
and
minerals
except
by
agreement
they're
not
going
to
take
anything
else
either.
apparently
the
only
thing
they
intend
to
take,
if
they
can
get
an
agreement,
is
timber
and
minerals.
they
don't
intend
to
take
anything
else
and
we
may
safely
assume
that
they
won't
except
by
agreement.
wouldn't
that
be
a
fair
interpretation
of
the
significance
of
the
1899
act.
1889.
--'89
act.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
it
was...
i
thought
it
was
conceded
in
this
case
that
the
reservation
included...
the
reservation
as
originally
set
aside
by
executive
order
included
submerged
lands.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
he
wasn't
authorized
permanently
to
reserve
anything,
i
presume,
was
he?
the
submerged
lands
are
in
the
same
position
as
any
other
portion
of
the
reservation,
isn't
that
so?
unknown
speaker
well
do
you
have
any
authority?
i
don't
see
then
why
you
made
the
concession.
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
before
you
get
to
the
second
element
i
just
want
to
get
clear
on
the
terms
that
are
being
used.
you
conceded
that
the
president
intended
to
include
submerged
lands
in
the
reservation
and
i
take
it
you
don't
dispute
the
fact
that
the
commissioner
had
by
this
time
filed
a...
a
report
saying
that
submerged
lands
were
included
in
the
reservation.
isn't
it
therefore
fair
to
assume
that
when
congress
was
talking
about
the
reservation
in
the
1889
act,
that
it
was
talking
about
the
reservation
as
so
understood,
i.e.,
the
reservation
as
the
president
intended
to
create
it
and
as
the
commissioner
had
described
it
to
include
submerged
lands.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
just
asking
right
now
what
congress
meant
when
it
was
talking
about
the
reservation
in
the
1889
act,
and
isn't
it
reasonable
to
suppose
that
it
meant
by
reservation
the
reservation
as
intended,
the
reservation
as
described
by
the
commissioner,
i.e.,
the
reservation
that
included
submerged
lands.
isn't
that
probably
what
it
meant
by
the
word?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
have
to
take
that
position?
i
mean,
can't
you
acknowledge
that
when
congress
was
speaking
about
the
reservation
it
was
talking
about
the
reservation
that
president
grant
had
created,
but
that
congress
knew
that
that
reservation
was
not
legally
effective
to
create
it
because
it
needed
ratification
which
had
not
occurred.
but
nevertheless
congress,
out
of
an
abundance
of
goodwill
to
the
indians,
was
not
willing
to
go
back
on
the
1873
executive
order
without
the
express
consent
of
the
indians,
but
that
still
doesn't
amount
to
any
effective
action
by
congress
creating
the
reservation.
i
mean,
your
basic
point
is
that
the
1873
executive
order
doesn't
do
anything
without
congressional
ratification,
which
never
occurred.
so
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
congress
in
the
1889
act
viewed
the
1873
order
which
it
knew
was
ineffective
absent
ratification
as
including
the
submerged
lands
or
not?
what
difference
does
it
make?
unknown
speaker
might
it
not
make
a
difference
in
what
congress
thought
it
was
doing
when
it
was
in
fact
passing
the
statehood
act
which
referred
to
reservations
of
the...
reservation
of
the
indian
reservation?
might
that
not
inform
us
in
what
congress
had
in
mind?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
do
because
in
alaska
we're
dealing
with.
in
effect,
a
two-party
situation.
we're
dealing
with
the
relationship
between
the
national
government
and
the
new
state.
here
we're
dealing
with
a
three
party
situation
and
one
of
the
things
i
would
think
that
would
be
an
indication
of
what
congress
meant
in
dealing
with
the
state
was
what
congress
understood
in
its
dealings
with
the
indians.
unknown
speaker
mr.
strack,
did
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
place
any
reliance
on
the
statehood
act?
as
i
read
it,
it
didn't,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
strack,
do
i
understand
your
position
correctly
that
it's
the
1889
agreement,
the
ratification
of
that,
if
that
had
come
nine
months
earlier,
if
that
had
come
before
statehood
instead
of
after
you
would
concede
that
the
tribe,
united
states
in
trust
for
the
tribe,
should
prevail.
is
that
what
this
whole
thing
turns
on,
that
it
was
nine
months
after
rather
than
before?
unknown
speaker
i'm
getting
confused.
you
said
a
moment
ago
the
1887
agreement,
did
you
misstate
that
or
are
there
two
agreements,
one
1887
and
one
1889?
unknown
speaker
tell
us
what
they
are
and
what
the
difference
is.
unknown
speaker
if
it
says
in
this
kind
of
grant,
suppose
it
said
specifically
we're
going
to
give
to
the
indian
tribe
and
not
to
idaho
the
right
to
use
navigable
waters
on
the
lake
would
that
be
sufficient
to
carry
with
it
submerged
lands?
unknown
speaker
so
what
would
it
have
taken,
if
the
1873
reservation
had
been
ratified,
would
that
have
done
it,
would
there
then
be
no
dispute?
i'm
trying
to
determine
what
it
is
in
the
state's
view
that
would
have
plainly
conferred
this
submerged
land
right
on
the
tribe.
unknown
speaker
so
ratifying
the
1873
reservation
executive
order,
that
would
not
have
been
sufficient
either?
unknown
speaker
and
that
position
explains
why
you
were
willing
to
leave
uncontested
any
of
the
fact
findings
and
said
the
only
question
is
what
did
congress
do.
you
didn't
question
what
the
executive
meant
or
any
of
the
fact
findings
but
only
what
congress
did
or
didn't
do.
unknown
speaker
in
terms
of
what
congress
set
to
do,
should
it
make
a
difference
whether
we're
talking
about
a
reservation
which
on
the
one
hand
has
simply
been
set
aside
by
executive
or
congressional
action
to
which
indians
were
moved
as
in
the
cherokees
and
so
on
or
whether
we're
talking
about
a
reservation
which
in
fact
covers
land
to
which
the
indians
have
an
aboriginal
title
or
an
aboriginal
claim
which
i
take
it
is
the
case
here.
unknown
speaker
very
well
mr.
strack.
mr.
givens,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say,
mr.
givens,
that
congress
was
specifically
informed
of,
i
gather
you're
not
suggesting
that
congress
took
any
action
in
response
to
them.
unknown
speaker
okay,
well
then,
are
these
acts
of
congress
you're
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
that,
please.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
know,
of
what
significance
is
the,
quote,
the
language,
quote,
congress,
quote,
knew
about
it
from
the
beginning.
are
you
suggesting
that
every
member
of
congress
read
these
reports?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
your
authority
for
saying
that
it
is
crucial
whether
or
not
congress
had
notice.
unknown
speaker
your
case
authority.
unknown
speaker
and
how
did
congress
know
of
that
survey?
unknown
speaker
was
this
a
joint
resolution
of
the
senate?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
the
house
report
showed
that
the
house
had
not...
was
this
a
report
of
the
full
house
or
of
a
committee
of
the
house.
unknown
speaker
on
that
specifically,
that's
why
i
asked
the
question,
i
think
mr.
strack
said,
well,
the
1887
is
it,
the
question
that
they
put
in
1888
was
does
it
include
any
portion
of
the
navigable
waters
of
the
lake
and
then
it
comes
back
it
does
include
all
the
navigable
waters.
but
he
said
the
navigable
waters
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
submerged
land,
that
it's,
maybe
they
gave
him
the
navigable
waters
but
that's
not
the
submerged
land
underneath
the
navigable
waters.
i
think
that
was
his
answer.
i'd
like
you
to
respond
to
that
because
all
the
documents
you
rely
upon
refer
to
navigable
waters,
as
none
of
them
says
anything
about
submerged
land.
unknown
speaker
i
haven't
spent
ten
years
with
them
so...
so
i
mean,
and
they're
arguing
the
opposite--
unknown
speaker
--and
therefore
i'd
like
to
know
what
specifically
it
is
that
allows
me
to
say
that
those
words
navigable
waters
includes
submerged
lands.
unknown
speaker
mr.
givens,
i
don't
think
there's
a
big
dispute
about
the
extent
of
the
reservation.
i
mean
that
isn't
really
what
the
dispute's
about.
the
dispute
is
whether,
when
you
describe
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation,
it
means
that
the
indians
have
aboriginal
occupation
rights
or
whether
it
means
the
extraordinary
thing
that
when
we
create
a
new
state,
the
land
under
navigable
waters
will
not
go
to
the
new
state,
and
how
do
you
get
that
out
of
simply
the
description
of
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation?
unknown
speaker
how
do
we
know
that
it
included
the
submerged
lands
as
opposed
to
the
surface
of
the
lake.
i
mean,
we
describe
water
area
in
acreage
just
as
well
as
land
area,
so
how
do
you
get
from
acreage
necessarily
submerged
land?
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
i
don't
see
that
it
shows
that
at
all
because
as
i
understand
it,
that
map
was
there
at
the
time
of
the
negotiations
between
general
simpson
and
a
tribal
chief
whose
name
i
forget
and
general
simpson
started
out
with
the
proposition
in
those
negotiations
that
in
fact
both
the
indians
and
the
whites
would
have
the
use
of
the
lake
and
that
led
to
an
immediate
disagreement.
the
one
thing
it
does
seem
to
show
is
that
general
simpson
did
not
understand
that
a
line
across
the
lake
necessarily
conveyed
either
an
exclusive
right
to
navigate,
let
alone
land
underneath
the
water.
unknown
speaker
that
may
be,
because
you
would
get
it
by
the
agreement
and
the
agreement
in
fact
had
not
been
ratified
by
the
time
of
statehood.
i
mean,
i
know
what
he
said
but
its
significance
for
this
case,
it
seems
to
be
equivocal.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
so
you're
assuming
that
indian
lands
in
the
idaho
statehood
act
referred
to
lands
as
defined
by
the
19...
by
the
1873
executive
order
and
i
don't...
i
don't
know
why
we
necessarily
should
make
that
assumption.
unknown
speaker
that
was
in
which
agreement;
i'm
sorry?
unknown
speaker
which
agreement
was
that
in?
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
that...
and
once
again
that
agreement
had
not
been
ratified
at
the
time
of
statehood;
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that
took
place
in
1887
and
1890
idaho
was
admitted
to
the
union
and
a
subsequent
congress
can
do
things
differently
than
an
earlier
congress.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
the
question
is
what
are
they
disclaiming?
justice
souter
asked
you
a
few
minutes
ago
how
do
we
know
that
what
was
defined
in
the
1873
reservation
was
what
idaho
disclaimed
in
its
1890
constitution?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
givens.
mr.
frederick,
we'll
hear...
did
united
states
have
statutory
authority
to
bring
this
action,
mr.
frederick?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
so
the
right
to
quiet
title
in
lands
which
the
government
claims
an
interest.
unknown
speaker
mr.
frederick,
can
i
ask
you
the
question
that
was
asked
of
mr.
strack,
why
does
it
matter
to
the
indians,
they
don't
want
people
to
have
to
wear
life
jackets,
is
that...
must
be
something
more
than
that.
unknown
speaker
could
the
tribe
engage
in
dredging
activities
that
would
affect
either
the
water
quality
or
the
level
of
the
portion
of
the
lake
that
is
not
within
the
tribe's
jurisdiction
even
under
your
theory?
unknown
speaker
why
does
the
united
states
have
paramount
authority
under
various
laws?
unknown
speaker
whether
the
state
or
the
tribe?
unknown
speaker
you
know,
there's
certainly
something
to
what
you
say,
but
that
just
totally
disparages
the
equal
footing
doctrine
as
if
it's
of
no
consequence
and
it
seems
to
me
it's
equally
possible
that
congress
may
have
been
at
varying
states
of
mind
in
varying
years.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
the
idea
that
every
member
of
congress
knew
that
negotiating
history
when
they
voted
to
admit
idaho
as
a
state
doesn't
make
any
sense
at
all.
unknown
speaker
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
rely
on
that
at
all.
unknown
speaker
we
don't
know
that
the
reference
in
the
statehood
act
was
to
the
same
lands
as
in
the
1873
reservation.
unknown
speaker
well
known
to
whom?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
every
member
of
congress,
and
that's
the
question
here,
what
did
congress
mean
when
it
admitted
idaho
to
the
union?
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
never
ratified.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that's
too
late
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
manifest
your
consent
when,
by
a
subsequent
act,
you're
relying
on
the
negotiations
and
the
negotiations
are
not
a
manifestation
of
consent?
you
need
something
before
the
statehood
act
that
shows
the
consent
of
congress.
unknown
speaker
they
don't
necessarily
show
that
they
recognize
the
kind
of
title
that
could
not
be
defeated
by
a
subsequent
creation
of
a
state.
they
just
show
that
the
indians
had
this
as
their
reservation.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
is
that
so
when
we
have
said
expressly
in
montana
and
in
utah
that
the
fact
that
a
lake
is
included
within
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation
does
not
itself
mean
that
the
submerged
lands
are
also
within
the
reservation?
we've
been
very
clear
on
that
in
alaska
and
alaska
repeated
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
can
you
tell
that
this
particular
reservation
the
line
was
drawn
across
the
submerged
lands?
it
could
just
as
easily
have
referred
to
the
navigable
waters.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that's...
i
just
looked
at
that
because
it
was
decided
and
i
can't
find
a
word
there,
of
course
they
get
the
navigable
waters.
that's
why
i
wanted
to
ask
and
mr.
strack
said
that
the
fact
that
they
are
given
navigable
waters
means
that
they
can
go
and
fish
on
the
lake,
it
doesn't
mean
they
have
a
right
to
the
submerged
lands,
that's
what
i
took
him
as
saying.
now,
that,
therefore
that
to
me
is
an
important
question
to
me
that
i'm
asking.
what
reason
is
there
for
thinking
that
if
they
gave
them
42
documents,
a
hundred
documents,
a
million
documents,
say
you
have
navigable
waters,
what
reason
is
there
for
thinking
that
that
includes
submerged
lands?
unknown
speaker
i'm
sorry,
that
doesn't
get
me
underneath
the
water
unless
they're
wearing
diving
helmets.
unknown
speaker
well,
was
the...
were
they
snorkeling
on
the
submerged
lands?
i
mean
surely
they
were
talking
about
trespass
on
the
water
of
the
lake.
unknown
speaker
let
me
try
it
once
more
because
i
was
thinking
my
answer
when
i
asked
it
would
be
nobody
has
ever
doubted
that
if
you
give
navigable
lands
to
the
indian
tribe
you're
giving
them
the
submerged
land,
i
mean
nobody
has
ever
tried
to
drive
a
wedge
between
navigable
waters
and
submerged
land,
but
that
wasn't
the
answer
i
got.
i
got
the
answer
yes,
they're
totally
different.
so
this
case
has
been
around
for
some
time
and
i
guess
by
now
you've
thought
of
what's
the
response
to
that
and
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get.
unknown
speaker
1887.
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
ratified
in
1891
after
idaho
was
already
a
state.
unknown
speaker
so
i
mean,
that's
a
lovely
agreement
but
it's
not
an
agreement
by
congress.
unknown
speaker
there
you
had
an
actual
reservation
of
jurisdiction
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
that
was
not...
not
present
here
in
the
act.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
in
the
statehood
act.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
make
the
argument
that
the
reference
to
title
doesn't
cover
this
because
submerged
lands
really
is
an
incident
of
sovereignty,
it
is
jurisdictional
rather
than
proprietary.
unknown
speaker
the
language
in
the
statehood
act
itself
which
through
cross-reference
to
the
understanding
would
be
taken
to
have
reserved
the
submerged
lands
for
the
indian
tribes.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
this
question
and
be
sure
i
have
your
theory.
i
don't
see
how
an
idaho
disclaimer
can
be
the
ratification
by
congress
that
is
necessary
here.
so
you're
actually
relying
on
the
statehood
act
itself
as
a
congressional
act
that
did
the
job
despite
the
fact
the
ninth
circuit
did
not?
unknown
speaker
but
would
it
be
enough
if
congress
knew
all
about
it
but
did
nothing
but
perfect
and
clear...
every
cong...
every
congressperson
was
aware
of
the
executive's
view
of
the
reservation,
would
that
have
been
enough?
unknown
speaker
how
does
it
do
it?
how...
what's
the
language
that
congress
passes
that
incorporates
the
provision
which
you
read
to
me
which
wasn't
from
the
congressional
resolution
but
was
from
the
idaho
constitution
which
idaho
says
doesn't
mean
this
now.
unknown
speaker
what
does
it
say?
i
mean,
is
there--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
frederick,
can
i
come
back
to
this
pollution
thing?
part
of
lake
coeur
d'alene
has,
i
understand,
is
badly
polluted
from
mine
tailings,
some
such
thing;
is
that
stuff
on
the
portion
that's
at
issue
here
or
is
it
on
another
portion?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
mr.
strack,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
we've
just
heard
about
wharfs,
about
harvesting
potatoes,
about
grants
for
the
mill,
does
that
indicate
the
sort
of
purposes
that
we
thought
were
important
in
alaska?
unknown
speaker
as
far
as
encroachments
on
the
lake,
doesn't
the
corps
of
engineers
have
authority
no
matter
whether
the
tribe
owns
the
submerged
lands
or
the
state
of
idaho?
doesn't
the
corps
get
to
say
what
can
encroach
out
in
the
navigable
water?
unknown
speaker
do
you
dispute
the
fact
that
the
corps
does
have
jurisdiction
to
determine
what
encroachments
are
authorized
in
navigable
water?
unknown
speaker
if
the
state
perhaps
regulates
more
stringently
then
the
corps
would
care
to,
that's
quite
possible.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
00-189,
idaho
versus
united
states
will
also
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
