justice
david
h.
souter
this
is
my
day.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
involves
a
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
idaho
over
ownership
of
submerged
lands
underlying
portions
of
lake
coeur
d'alene
and
the
st.
joe
river.
the
disputed
lands
are
within
a
vast
area
that
was
once
inhabited
by
the
coeur
d’alene
tribe
of
indians.
in
1873,
in
the
phase
of
an
influx
of
immigration
into
that
tribal
territory,
president
grant
set
aside
an
exclusive
tribal
reservation.
during
the
1880s,
the
tribe
and
the
united
states
negotiated
over
the
size
of
that
reservation
and
over
the
tribe’s
continuing
claim
to
other
aboriginal
lands.
although
they
reached
several
agreements,
before
the
agreements
were
ratified
by
congress,
the
state
of
idaho
was
admitted
into
the
union
in
1890.
it
was
not
until
eight
months
later
that
congress
approved
the
agreements
by
which
the
tribe
ceded
aboriginal
lands
and
part
of
the
1873
reservation
in
return
for
compensation
and
for
congressional
confirmation
of
the
reservation
that
remained.
in
1994,
the
united
states
sued
idaho
to
determine
ownership
of
the
portion
of
the
lakebed
and
the
riverbed
within
the
tribe’s
current
reservation.
the
district
court
quieted
title
in
favor
of
the
united
states
as
trustee
for
the
tribe.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
due
to
the
public
importance
of
the
navigable
waterways,
ownership
of
the
land
under
such
waters
is
closely
identified
with
the
sovereign
power
of
government.
a
court
deciding
a
question
of
title
to
the
bed
of
navigable
water
must
therefore
begin
with
a
strong
presumption
in
favor
of
state’s
title
and
with
that
presumption,
we
have
looked
to
congress’
declarations
and
intent
in
order
to
resolve
conflicts
over
submerged
lands
that
it
claimed
to
have
been
conveyed
or
reserved
by
the
united
states
before
statehood.
via
submerged
lands
beneath
navigable
waters
are
located
in
the
tract
that
national
government
has
reserved
for
a
particular
national
purpose.
we
asked
whether
congress
intended
to
include
the
submerged
lands
within
the
federal
reservation,
and
if
so,
whether
congress
intended
to
defeat
the
future
state’s
title.
this
two
step
test
of
congressional
intent
can
be
satisfied
in
the
context
of
land
reserved
by
the
executive
branch,
if
the
executive
reservation
clearly
included
submerged
lands
and
congress
recognized
the
reservation
in
a
way
that
demonstrates
an
intent
to
defeat
state
title.
here,
idaho
has
conceded
that
the
executive
branch
intended
the
1873
executive
water
reservation
to
include
submerged
lands
and
that
by
1888
congress
was
on
notice
of
that
fact.
both
of
those
concessions
are
sound
in
light
of
the
district
court
findings
that
we
found
in
detail
in
our
opinion.
the
manner
in
which
congress
proceeded
to
deal
with
the
tribe
made
it
plain
that
congress’
object
was
to
obtain
tribal
interests
and
modify
the
extent
of
the
reservation
only
by
tribal
consent.
its
object
was
therefore
necessarily
to
deny
idaho
title
to
any
unrelinquished
submerged
lands
within
the
reservation.
congress,
for
example,
undertook
in
an
1889
act
to
authorize
negotiations
with
the
tribe
for
the
consensual
compensated
session
of
such
portions
of
the
reservation
as
the
tribe
would
consent
to
sell.
this
and
other
evidence
shows
that
congress’
intent
was
clearly
that
anything
not
ceded
by
the
tribe
would
remain
for
the
tribe’s
benefit.
an
object
that
is
flatly
at
odds
with
idaho’s
view
that
congress
meant
to
transfer
submerged
lands
to
the
state
in
what
would
have
amounted
to
an
active
bad
faith
accomplished
by
the
unspoken
operation
of
law.
idaho’s
position
is
also
at
odds
with
later
manifestations
of
congressional
understanding
that
statehood
had
not
affected
title
to
the
submerged
lands.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
scalia,
kennedy
and
thomas
join.
