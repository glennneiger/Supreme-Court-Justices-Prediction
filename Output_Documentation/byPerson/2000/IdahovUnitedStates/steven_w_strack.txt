mr.
steven
w.
strack
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
four
years
ago
in
a
decision
that
involved
these
same
parties,
the
court
affirmed
the
principal
that
submerged
lands
are
an
essential
attribute
of
state
sovereignty.
today
the
court
is
asked
to
determine
whether
this
essential
attribute
of
sovereignty
was
defeated
by
the
act
of
march
2nd,
1889,
an
act
that
authorized
negotiations
for
the
purchase
of
timber
and
mineral
lands.
under
law,
the
1889
act
embodies
a
presumption
against
defeat
of
state
title.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
actually
the
acreage
would
be
more
like
one-fourth
of
the
lake.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
yes.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
this
is
the
southern
part
of
lake
coeur
d'alene
and
we're
also
talking
about
the
lower
15
or
20
miles
of
the
st.
joe
river.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
well,
i
think
it
makes
a
very
large
difference
from
the
state's
viewpoint,
justice
o'connor,
because
this
is
a
public
highway.
this
is
not
just
an
isolated
body
of
water.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
we
care
because
the
majority
of
the
users
on
the
lake
are
not
indians
and
because
of
that
we
have
a
significant
interest
in
protecting
their
safety,
for
example,
citing
people
who
are
boarding
in
an
unsafe
manner
or
if
citing
someone
who
doesn't
have
the
requisite
amount
of
life
vests
on
board
for
small
children.
it's
not
clear
the
tribe
could
fill
that
role--
mr.
steven
w.
strack
--because
this
is
a
public
highway
and
the
court
has
been
very
clear
that
on
a
public
highway
tribes
usually
do
not
have
general
sovereign
authority
over
non-indians.
that's
because
they
don't
have
the
power
to
exclude
generally
and
that's
the
basis
of
tribal
authority
over
non-indians,
in
most
instances.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
because
the
tribe
has
basically
precluded
us
from
that
and
i
believe
the
court's
decree
precludes
us
from
doing
that
also.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
justice
breyer,
i
think
there's
a
lot
more
at
stake
than
simply
that.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
i
think
there's
many
practical
applications,
justice
breyer,
as
we
spoke
about
in
our
brief.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
oh,
for
example,
we
have
an
in-stream
flow,
a
statutory
in-stream
flow
that
protects
the
lake
level
and
that's
certainly
broadened
the
question
by
this
concept
of
tribal
ownership
of
at
least
a
portion
of
the
lake.
we
have--
mr.
steven
w.
strack
--another
practical
aspect
would
be,
for
example,
our
statute
that
prevents
dredging
on
this
portion
of
the
river.
that
would
no
longer
have
any
validity
because
now
it's
tribal
land.
and
so
generally
this,
we
treat
this
lake
as
a
public
resource
and
a
recreation
place.
the
state
protects
public
access
and
because
it
is
a
public
resource,
the
public,
if
we
fail
in
our
duties
the
public
can
sue
us.
that
wouldn't
necessarily
be
true
of
the
tribe
on
the
lake
because
then
it
becomes
managed
not
for
public
uses
necessary
but
for
whatever
use--
mr.
steven
w.
strack
--justice
o'connor
i
haven't
seen
any
evidence
of
that
to
date.
they
have
simply
stepped
back
and
let
the
tribe
regulate.
i
haven't
seen
any
evidence
of
the
federal
government
having
any
interest
in
doing
that.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
justice
o'connor,
actually
the
harrison
session
was
not
a
conveyance
of
land,
they
simply
bought
land
from
the
tribe.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
got
a
cession
of
land
from
the
tribe
but
they
never
exercised
any
ownership
right
over
that
little
corner
of
the
lake.
that
was
part
of
that
harrison
cession.
they
never
conveyed
it
to
anybody.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
the
post
cession
occurred
in
the
1880...
1891
act.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
first
of
all,
on
the
harrison
cession,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
void
because
they
were
simply
changing
the
boundary
across
a
navigable
waterway.
they
could
do
that
today
if
they
wanted
to
and
we
would
have
no
problem
with
that
if
they
wanted
to
take
a
portion
of
the
lake
out
of
reservation.
we
would
have
a
problem
if
they
attempted
to
convey
it
to
somebody,
but
they
didn't
do
that
in--
mr.
steven
w.
strack
--it's
a
simple
cession.
i
think
the
tribe
could
agree
that
we're
going
to
cede
this
portion
of
the
lake
out
of
the
reservation.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
yes.
i
think
it's
a
jurisdictional
boundary,
not
just
a
property
boundary
so
they
can
certainly
say
yes,
we'll
agree
to
moving
this
jurisdictional
boundary
over
to
this
part
of
the
lake,
and
i
don't
think
that
would
have
any
violation
of
the
state's
rights
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
well,
justice
ginsburg,
the
way
i
view
submerged
lands
is
that
they're
a
blend
of
sovereign
rights
and
property
rights,
and
so...
but
there
is
examples
where
if
there
is
a
conveyance
of
property
and
a
conveyance
of
sovereignty,
the
submerged
lands
go
with
the
sovereignty
because
they're
an
attribute
of
sovereignty.
it's
a
very
loose
situation.
but
what
i
was
talk...
referring
to
before
was
the
fact
that
reservation
boundaries
are
not
just
property
boundaries,
they're
also
jurisdictional
boundaries,
especially
nowadays
where
we
have
allotted
reservations
such
as
this
one,
and
so
they
can
move
the
reservation
boundary
without
necessarily
applying
anything
as
to
property
rights
on
either
side
of
that--
mr.
steven
w.
strack
--justice
scalia,
yes,
i
do
mean
a
boundary
of
sovereignty.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
i
think
in
the
case
of
the
harrison
cession,
justice
scalia,
again
there
was
no
exercise
of
property
rights
once
that
cession
occurred
but--
mr.
steven
w.
strack
--that's
correct.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
justice
scalia,
i
think
i
see
the
source
of
your
confusion
and
perhaps
i
could
clear
that
up
a
bit.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
and
the
fact
is
that
within
an
indian
reservation
there
is
a
shared
sovereignty.
state
sovereignty
extends
over
jurisdictions,
but
so
does
federal
sovereignty,
and
so
a
jurisdictional
line
as
i'm
speaking
of
it
here
would
be
a
line
wherein
in
this
would
define
indian
country
in
which
the
federal
government
would
have
perhaps
special
preemptive
powers
over
state
sovereignty.
we
don't
view
this
as
an
either/or
situation
where
you
either
have
state
sovereignty
or
you
have
federal
sovereignty.
there's
always
going
to
be
shared
sovereignty
within
indian
country,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
here,
there's
numerous
examples
of
this
kind
of
shared
sovereignty
or
special
beneficial
rights
that
tribes
own
in
sovereign
lands
without
defeating
state
title.
i
think
a
wonderful
example
is
the
usual
and
accustomed
fishing
right
that
many
tribes
have
in
the
northwest
and
there
they
have
the
right
to
fish
at
these
places,
occupy
these
places,
it's
a
special
right
in
submerged
lands
but
it
does
not
defeat
state
sovereignty
over
those
lands.
and
so
certainly
there's
a
number
of
examples
where
we
have
this
beneficial
interest
in
a
tribe
that
does
not
necessarily
imply
anything
as
far
as
a
state's
sovereign
right
to
regulate
itself.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
i
think
that
would
be
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
they
would
not
take
the
portion
that
they
were
authorized
to
purchase
except
by
agreement
and
that
would
have
been
the
timber
and
mineral
lands,
yes.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
in
terms
of
submerged
lands,
i
think,
justice
souter,
that
is
what
we
are
submitting,
that
this
was
an
act
that
sought
diminishment
of
the
reservation
and
congress
knew
that
it
would
be
focused
on
the
northern
part
of
the
reservation
and
they
knew
that
the
northern
part
of
the
reservation
contained
submerged
lands.
that
was
all
contained
in
the
1888
report
to
congress.
but,
in
seeking
that
diminishment,
they
did
not
authorize
the
purchase
of
submerged
lands,
so
how
could
they
seek
diminishment--
mr.
steven
w.
strack
--there's
no
evidence
at
all
in
the
record,
justice
souter,
that
congress
believed
these
submerged
lands
to
have
any
mineral
value
whatsoever.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
justice
souter,
i
think
we
would
disagree
for
the
fact
that
i...
in
fact,
it
would
be
strange
if
we
believed
that
the
tribe
had
owned
these
lands
prior
to
the
1889
act.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
we
conceded
the
fact,
justice
souter,
that
the
president
intended
to
reserve
those
submerged
lands
but
we
made
that
concession
in
light
of
the
trial
court's
finding
that
the
president
was
not
authorized
to
permanently
reserve
those
lands.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
no,
i
think
i
would
disagree
with
that,
justice
souter,
because
i
think
submerged
lands
are
in
a
special
status.
certainly
the
president
has
the
authority
to
set
aside
lands,
prevent
settlement
on
those
lands,
but
submerged
lands
usually
are
not
public
lands
in
that
sense.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
we
made
the
concession
that
he
intended
to
reserve
the
submerged
lands
because
that
was
basically
a
factual
finding
and
we
did
not
view
it
significant
in
light
of
the
fact
that
you
would
have
to
have
the
subsequent
congressional
ratification
and
we
wanted
to
focus
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
second
element
of
the
alaska
test
which
is
the
need
for
ratification.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
justice
souter,
we
certainly
recognize
that
congress
was
looking
at
the
reservation
boundaries
as
established
and
working
on
the
basis
of
the
information
that
was
provided
in
the
1888
report.
but
we
would
agree
with
that,
but
we
would
question
whether
or
not
congress
actually
approved
that
inclusion
because
of
this
omission
of
submerged
lands.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
looking
at
the
1889
act
as
a
whole,
justice
souter,
i
don't
think
i
would
agree
with
that
statement
because
of
this
omission
of
the
submerged
lands
to
my
mind
raises
a
question
as
to
whether
congress
recognized
that
inclusion.
and
if
we
look
back
at
the
1888
report,
it
does
not
mention
submerged
lands
per
se.
it
does
not
mention
of
bed
of
the
lake.
it
mentions
the
fact
that
the
reservation
embraces
these
navigable
waters.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
i
think
you're
correct
in
that
assumption.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
justice
souter,
when
i
say
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
i'm
referring
to
the
second
prong
of
the
alaska
test.
under
that
prong
you
would
still
have
to
have
this
affirmative
declaration
of
intent.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
your
honor,
i
would
agree
with
that
but
i
think
an
essential
background
fact
that
perhaps
we're
not
taking
into
account
is
the
fact
that
executive
orders
at
this
point
were
not
thought
to
convey
any
property
interest
to
tribes.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
your
honor,
it
mentioned
the
statehood
act
but
it
did
not
rely
on
it
for
a
finding
that
state
title
had
been
defeated,
that's
correct.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
think
we
would
agree
with
that
because
if
the
1891
act
had
in
fact
been
enacted
before
statehood,
then
we
would
have
to
look
at
this
under
the
conveyance
rules
of
holt
state
bank
and
montana,
and
there
the
court
said
that
where
a
tribe
is
simply
granted
a
continuing
right
of
aboriginal
occupation
that
that
right
usually
would
not
carry
with
it
title
to
submerged
lands.
it
may
have
an
interest
in
submerged
lands,
but
not
sufficient
to
defeat
state
title.
and
here,
all
of
the
rights
vested
in
the
tribe
came
as
a
result
of
the
1887
agreement
which
provided
that
these
lands
would
be
held
as
indian
land
which
is
simply
a
restatement
of
this
principle
of
aboriginal
occupation.
there
was
no
additional
rights
vested
in
the
tribe
as
the
result
of
the
1889
agreement.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
two
agreements
here.
maybe
i
could
walk
through
it.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
in
1887,
the
tribe
and
the
united
states
negotiated
an
agreement
that
would
cede
all
lands
outside
the
1873
boundaries
and
as
part
of
that
agreement
they
agreed
that
the
tribe
would
continue
to
hold
the
land
within
the
reservation
as
indian
land.
then
in
1889
we
have
the
second
agreement
which
was
only
a
cession
agreement
specifically
limited
to
purchase
of
lands
by
the
1889
act
and
in
the
agreement
there
was
no
additional
rights
of
conveyance.
there's
no
language
of
conveyance
in
the
1889
agreement
itself.
it's
simply
a
quit
claim
to
the
northern
portion
of
the
reservation.
so
whatever
rights
the
tribe
holds
in
the
southern
third
of
the
lake
and
the
remainder
of
the
reservation
are
necessarily
going
to
be
founded
in
the
language
of
the
1887
act
which
defines
the
tribe's
rights.
and
under
montana,
where
we
simply
have
a
continued
right
of
aboriginal
occupation,
that
type
of
conveyance
to
a
tribe
would
not
normally
carry
with
it
an
interest
in
a
lake
bed
that
would
be
sufficient
to
defeat
state
title.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
justice
breyer,
i
would
say
it
would
not
because
again
that
would
simply
be
a
beneficial
interest
and
we
have
numerous
examples
of
where
tribes
have
beneficial
interest
in
submerged
lands
without
a
defeat
of
state
title.
for
example,
they
could
reserve
an
exclusive
fishing
right.
they
could
reserve
a
fishing
right
in
common
with
other
people.
but
i
think
the
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
because
of
this
presumption
against
defeat
of
state
title
that
we
should
always
assume
that
congress
would
try
to
accommodate
tribal
rights
and
state
interest
in
public
ownership
of
these
lands
to
the
extent
possible.
and
here
where
all
we
have
is
a
simple
right
of
use,
that
would
probably
not
be
sufficient.
again,
i
think
it's
worth
pointing
out
that
in
neither
of
these
agreements
is
there
a
fishing
right
provided
to
the
tribe
expressly,
which
is
very
unusual
for
a
northwestern
tribe.
i
think
that
admission
by
itself
is
very
telling
in
the
legislative
history
leading
up
to
the
1889
act
and
the
1889
agreement,
again
we
see
numerous
references
to
this
tribe
as
a
farming
tribe,
not
as
a
fishing
tribe.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
it
would
take
something
akin
to
section
6
c
which
was
reviewed
in
the
alaska
case
which
would
be
reratified
as
reservation
and
prevent
any
passage
of
lands
to
the
future
state
of
idaho.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
a
ratification
just
by
itself
because
the
courts
always
look
for
that
additional
affirmative
language
somehow,
like
in
the
choctaw
case
where
you
have
fee
title
but
it
was
suggested
that
even
that
fee
title
might
not
be
sufficient
because
the
court
then
relied
on
that
passage
which
said
no
part
of
this
reservation
shall
ever
be
part
of
any
future
state.
and
again,
we
see
that
in
the
alaska
case,
none
of
these
lands
will
ever
be
passed
to
the
future
state.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
justice
souter,
i
believe
the
distinction
the
court
has
made
in
the
past
is
between
an
affirmative
grant
of
rights
and
a
continuing
aboriginal
occupation
of
rights.
i
don't
know
that
it
would
make
a
difference
if
the
tribe
had
not
aboriginally
occupied
the
territory
or
not.
certainly
what
it
looks
for
is
that
affirmative
grant
in
that
language
which
says
that
no
party's
land
shall
ever
pass
to
the
future
state.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
on
this
question
of
whether
or
not
there's
a
difference
between
beds
and
navigable
waters,
i
think
the
court
has
made
that
very
clear
in
the
alaska
decision
where
the
court
looked
to
purposes
that
required
ownership
of
the
beds
themselves;
for
example,
the
need
to
own
the
bed
to
preserve
the
oil
deposits.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
looking
back
at
the
1889
act
i
don't
think
any
of
those
purposes
are
evident
on
the
face
of
the
1889
act.
if
there
was
a
purpose
and
the
only
purpose
they
have
identified
is
fishing,
and
that
itself
does
not
require
ownership
of
the
beds
of
the
navigable
waters
themselves
unless
they're
fishing
methods
for
some
reason
required
ownership
of
the
bed
like
a
fishing
weir,
but
we
don't
see
any
evidence
that
they
were
doing
that
in
1889.
so
again
i
think
we
need
to
look
at
the
purposes
here
and
see
whether
or
not
those
require
ownership
of
navigable
waters,
ownership
of
the
beds
of
navigable
waters
as
opposed
to
the
waters
themselves.
i'd
like
to
go
back
too
to
the
question
of
practical
effect
because
i
think
it
obviously
is
a
concern
here.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
all
of
the
lands
along
the
shore
of
the
lake
are
owned
by
non-indians
and
that's
been
true
since
1910
when
the
reservation
was
allotted.
those
lands,
those
people
have
riparian
rights
which
they
look
to
the
state
to
protect
and
define.
many
of
those
people
have
encroachments
on
the
lake
and
that's
where
our
ownership
of
the
beds
comes
into
play
because
we
regulate
those
encroachments
so
that
they
do
not
go
out
far
enough
to
impair
navigation
and
other
uses
of
the
lake.
so
all
of
these
people
along
the
lake,
now
their
riparian
rights
are
called
into
question
because
the
state
no
longer
owns
the
beds
of
the
lake
according
to
the
decree
and
so
we
don't
know
what
the
effect
of
that
would
be.
on
the
issue
of
pollution
it
works
both
ways,
so
the
tribe
has
an
interest
in
protecting
the
lake
from
pollution
and
the
state
has
an
equal
interest,
if
not
more
so,
because
we
own
the
remainder
of
the
lake,
and
when
you
split
a
system
like
this
in
two
it
becomes
very
hard
to
regulate
that
in
a
consistent
manner.
for
example--
mr.
steven
w.
strack
--justice
o'connor,
for
the
most
part
the
corps
is
not
involved
in
these
kinds
of
encroachments
unless
there's
dredging
and
filling.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
where
there's
a
fail
interest
involved,
justice
o'connor
they
certainly
could
come
in
and
preempt,
but
it's
my
experience
that
we
regulate
all
those
encroachments
and
i'm
not
aware
of
the
corps
ever
being
involved
in
those
kinds
of
decisions.
mr.
steven
w.
strack
that
is
quite
possible
because
of
the
statute
that
we
have
in
place
protecting
the
lake
as
a
public
resource
for
recreation
and
other
public
uses.
and
so
when
we
have
a
split
system
like
this,
especially
on
issues
such
as
fisheries,
if
the
tribe
was
to
introduce
new
species
of
fish
that
was
not
genetically
compatible
with
the
fisheries
that
we
have
in
the
remainder
of
the
lake,
we
could
have
some
real
problems
there.
so
there's
tremendous
practical
effects
that
result
not
only
from
tribal
ownership
but
tribal
ownership
of
a
small
portion
of
the
greater
lake.
on
the
issue
of...
mr.
givens
mentioned
the
acreage
that
included
in
the
report,
the
acreage
that
included
navigable
waters
but
it's
also
important
to
look
at
the
acreage
of
the
cession
that
was
reported.
according
to
the
united
states'
exit
report
at
page
237
the
acreage
that
was
ceded
in
1889
was
243,000
acres
and
that
included
37,000
acres
of
the
lake.
but
the
house
report
1109
reported
that
acreage
as
185,000
acres.
that's
found
at
page
315
of
the
joint
appendix.
so
obviously
congress
did
not
view
this
cession
as
including
the
lake
bed
itself.
they
did
not
view
themselves
as
having
purchased
that
from
the
lake.
