mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
brief
is
built
on
the
premise
that
the
functionality
doctrine,
the
traditional
functionality
doctrine
of
trademark
law
is
what
makes
trademark
protection
of
trade
dress
and
other
symbolic
elements
consistent
with
this
court's
patent
law
jurisprudence,
as
synthesized
and
reaffirmed
as
recently
as
the
bonito
boats
case,
but
i
think
part
of
the
reason
the
two
laws
harmonize
is
because
the
use
of
functionality
doctrine
is
to
limit
the
scope
of
protection
of
the
device.
its
traditional
function
was
to
bar
the
holder
of
a
patent
or
other
utilitarian
device,
even
if
nonpatented,
from
withdrawing
that
device
from
the
public
domain
when
there's
no
longer
the
protection
of
the
patent
as
trade...
withdrawing
it
from
the
public
domain
as
trade
dress
because
people
have
a
right
to
practice
and
use
as
the
building
blocks
for
further
innovation
whatever
devices
are
in
the
public
domain
that
are
utilitarian
in
nature,
including
their
overall
configuration,
but
there
is
still
protection
against
confusing
similarity
through
requirements
of
labeling,
packaging,
avoiding
palming
off
and
other
misrepresentations.
functionality
really
goes
to
the
scope
of
protection,
and
limits
the
scope
of
protection
available
under
trademark
law
by
preventing
someone
from
monopolizing
and
withdrawing
from
the
public
domain
utilitarian
features
or
the
entire
utilitarian
device
in
the
absence
of
valid
patent
protection.
that
is
the
domain
of
patent
law,
and
one
must
qualify
for
a
patent
and
have
a
valid
patent
in
order
to
have
a
legal
monopoly
that
withdraws,
that
prevents
others
from
using
the
device,
but
there...
as
i
say,
these
other
protections
are
still
available
as
well
as
the
ability
to
exclude
ornamental
or
incidental
features.
that
is
what
to
us
harmonizes
the
two
statutory
schemes.
the
traditional
understanding
of
functionality
was
not
an
artificial
concept.
it
was
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word.
what
enables
the
device
to
function
is
what
is
functional.
that
was
reflected
in
a
very
terse
quotation
we
have
in
a
footnote
on
page
17
of
our
brief
by
representative
lanham
himself,
when
someone
raised
concerns
about
whether
the
trademark
law
might
result
in
compromising
of
the
public's
right
to
use
useful
inventions,
and
he
said--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
absolutely
correct.
we
would
come
out
the
same
way
as
we
were...
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
bonito
boats
is
an
example
of
that,
because
there
was
no
patent
shown
in
the
record,
as
the
court
noted,
of
the
boat
hull
that
they
said
could
not
be
copied.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
with
regard
to
the
scope
of
protection,
that
others
cannot
be
excluded
from
using
something
utilitarian.
as
we
compressed
our
brief
down
to
our
allotted
30
pages
we
carefully
preserved
a
quotation
on
page
11
that
you
can
see
at
the
top
of
the
page
from
the
1917,
or
1911,
excuse
me,
seventh
circuit
decision
because
it
states
the
common
sense
of
it.
if
you
have
utilitarian
features
that
didn't
even
meet
the
standard
for
getting
a
patent,
they
should
not
be
given
a
perpetual
monopoly
in
contrast
to
what
was
then
the
17-year
monopoly
that
you
could
get
if
you
met
the
criteria
for
patentability.
the
other
protections
available
against
confusing
similarity
make
the
need
for
a
right
to
exclude
imitation
of
trade
dress
relatively
unimportant
compared
to
the
policies
this
court
has
reiterated
at
least
since
1896
in
the
singer
case
about
the
need
for
utilitarian
features
to
be
used
as
building
blocks
and
to
be
in
the
public
domain
except
for
the
limited
period
of
time
in
which
they
are
protected
by
a
valid
and
unexpired
patent,
and
we
understand
this
court's
decision
in
qualitex
to
mean
much
the
same
thing.
the
difficulty
has
arisen
because
an
alternative
test
of
functionality
has
also
become
appropriate
as
the
scope
of
trademark
protection
has
extended
to
matters
that
don't
have
utilitarian
features
to
them.
we
point
particularly
to
the
protection
of
color
as
an
example,
where
there
is
relevance
to
looking
at
competitive
need
in...
we
give
an
example
in
our
brief
of
an
orange-colored
can
of
soda.
there
were
other
amicus
submissions
in
the
qualitex
case
in
which
people
were
making
claims
that
raised
issues
that
went
quite
beyond
what
was
involved
in
the
press
pad
that
was
at
issue
in
qualitex.
one
of
them,
for
example,
involved
orange-colored
sprinkler
system
piping.
well,
it
raised
other
questions.
i
don't
say
the
result
would
necessarily
be
different
but
one
would
have
to
examine
whether
a
competitor
who
wanted
to
compete
for
replacing
a
portion
of
the
piping
would
be
disadvantaged
if
he
couldn't
match
the
color
of
it.
it
was
a
different
case
from
the
federal
circuit's
corning,
owens-corning
case
involving
the
pink-colored
insulation,
because
that
goes
behind
the
wall
and
people
don't
see
it.
the
orange
coloring
in
some
contexts
connotes
danger,
and
perhaps
there
is
marketing
significance
to
that.
but
the
mistake
that
i
think
some
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
made,
including
the
sixth
circuit
in
this
case,
is
to
say
that
that
is
now
the
exclusive
approach,
and
you
wind
up
with
multi-factored
tests
that
don't
really
give
an
adequate
guidance
to
what
the
law
is.
a
very
good
example
is
found
on
page
17
of
the
light
green
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
international
trademark
association
in
this
case,
in
which
they
speak
approvingly
of
various
multi-factored
tests
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
adopted
in
this
area,
which
leaves
open
what
this
court
in
its
salutary
opinion
in
wal-mart
v.
samara
brothers
referred
to
as
the
plausible
threat
of
litigation
which
can
discourage
competitors
and
become
an
impediment
to
the
benefits
that
consumers
would
get
from
competition,
and
to
have
tests
of
this
kind
applied
to
displace
the
traditional
approach
to
functionality
would
be
very
detrimental
to
competitors
for
the
very
reasons
the
court
has
recognized
in
the
cases
synthesized
in
the
bonito
boats
opinion.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--both...
either
test
can
show
that
something
is
functional,
whichever
one
suits
the
needs
of
the
particular
factual
situation.
