mr.
john
a.
artz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
granted
certiorari
due
to
a
conflict
between
regional
courts
of
appeals
on
one
issue,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
visual
image
and
appearance
of
a
product...
with
a
product
whose
operation
and
performance
was
covered
by
a
utility
patent,
can
still
be
protected
as
trade
dress
under
section
43(a)
of
the
lanham
act.
the
imposition
of
any
per
se
rule,
whether
the
government's
rule
or
traffix
rule,
which
says
it
cannot
be
protected
in
my
opinion
is
unnecessary,
unjustified,
and
unworkable.
it's
unnecessary
because
there
are
already
adequate
rules
in
place,
the
trade
dress
rules
and
functionality
that
have
been
referred
to
already.
it's
unjustified
because
it
would
cause
harm
to
the
public's
right
not
to
be
confused
or
deceived.
those
are
paramount
in
trade
dress
and
trademark
cases
under
the
lanham
act.
that's
a
touchstone
of
the
lanham
act.
it
would
also--
mr.
john
a.
artz
--yes.
mr.
john
a.
artz
well,
justice
o'connor,
the
mediating
factor
between
the
two
is
the
functionality
test,
in
my
opinion.
there's...
you've
got
the
patent
laws,
you've
got
the
trademark
laws
and
the
lanham
act,
two
federal
laws--
mr.
john
a.
artz
--well,
in
the
qualitex
case,
the
qualitex
gave
a
specific
definition
of
functionality,
and
remember
now,
in
1998-1999,
congress
made
some
amendments
to
the
trademark
act,
or
lanham
act,
and
in
this
they
specifically
mentioned
functionality
several
times.
they
added
it
to
the
fact
that
you
can't
have
functional
trademarks...
you
can't
have
trademark
that's
functional
but
if
it's
nonfunctional
you
can,
and
they
knew
about
the
vornado
case
at
that
time
because
it
was
decided
in
1995,
and
that's
the
tenth
circuit,
and
there's
a
lot
of
flurry
of
activity
in
the
intellectual
property
bar
because
of
that,
so
all
that
was
before
congress
when
it
amended
it,
and
congress
did
not
go
to
any
per
se
test
at
that
time,
and
so
you've
got
two
federal
laws
here,
and
under
the
morton
case
and
the
ruckelshaus
case
which
are
cited.
mr.
john
a.
artz
no,
they
did
not.
i
mean,
because
they...
what
they...
they
actually...
the
legislative
history
mentions
the
fact
that
their
patent
expiration,
and
people
might
be
trying
to
get
trademark
protection
after
the
expiration
of
the
patent,
and
then
they
go
on
to
add
functionality.
mr.
john
a.
artz
well,
what
i'm
saying
is,
in
1995
that
vornado
case
was
there,
and
in
1998
congress
amended
the
trademark
act.
now,
there's
no
legislative
history
that
i
can
see
that
actually
mentioned
the
vornado
case.
i'm
saying
that
it
probably--
mr.
john
a.
artz
--yes.
yes,
i
am,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
artz
yes.
mr.
john
a.
artz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
artz
yes.
mr.
john
a.
artz
no.
mr.
john
a.
artz
well,
that's--
mr.
john
a.
artz
--well,
every
case
which
has
actually
looked
at
functionality
actually
has
come
up
with
the
result
that
the
sixth
circuit
did,
the
seventh
circuit
did--
mr.
john
a.
artz
--that's
correct.
mr.
john
a.
artz
well,
the
supreme
court
goes
on
in
the
qualitex
case
and
says,
that
is...
that
is,
if
exclusive
use
of
the
feature
would
put
competitors
at
a
significant
nonreputational
related
disadvantage.
mr.
john
a.
artz
i
think
that--
mr.
john
a.
artz
--i
think
that
is
the
test,
your
honor,
whether
or
not--
mr.
john
a.
artz
--yes.
mr.
john
a.
artz
i
believe
it
is,
yes.
mr.
john
a.
artz
it
involves
how
things
look,
the
appearance,
visual--
mr.
john
a.
artz
--okay.
mr.
john
a.
artz
well,
it's
aesthetic
in
that
sense,
but
it's
not...
it
doesn't
involve
color,
no,
it
does
not.
it's
not
like
the
color
that
was
allowed
in
the
qualitex
case,
but
i
think
that
is
the
test.
mr.
john
a.
artz
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
the
case,
midwest
case
by
the
federal
circuit,
the
thomas
&
betts
case
of
the
seventh
circuit,
our
case,
sixth
circuit,
and
the
sunbeam
case,
fifth
circuit,
all
apply
the
proper
test.
there
are
different
forms
of
intellectual
property
laws,
or
ip
laws,
as
i
call
them,
you've
got
five
different
basically
federal
laws
on
intellectual
property,
patents,
copyrights,
trademarks,
trade
dress,
unfair
competition.
they're
all
separate
and
distinct.
the
fact
that
you
have
a
patent
on
something,
that
is
different
than
whether
or
not
you
can
have
a
trade
dress
on
something.
patent
would
be
relevant
in
the
sense
that
under
this
commercial
necessity
test,
if
there's
only
one
way
to
make
that
product,
that
was
look
and
appearance,
then
it's
functional,
and
so
in
that
sense
the
functionality
test
would
apply
and
the
patent,
if
it
says
something
about
the
functionality,
that
would
be
relevant
to
the
functionality
test
in
the
trade
dress
area,
but
they're
separate
and
distinct,
and
they
always
have.
design
patents,
for
example--
mr.
john
a.
artz
--no,
i
don't
think
it's
unfair
at
all,
your
honor.
i
think
they're
separate
and
distinct.
i
agree
that
perhaps,
if
you
have
this
17-year
monopoly
on
this
patent,
that
might
help
you
on
the
trade
dress
area
with
respect
to
secondary
meaning,
but
then,
of
course,
just
as
we
found
here,
the
functionality
test,
the
fact
that
you
had
a
patent
on
it
actually
hurts
you.
it
might
be
a
wash
between
those
two.
the
trade
dress
has
three
separate
and
distinct
tests.
you
have
to
show
it's
distinctive...
in
other
words,
it
has
secondary
meaning...
and
the
public
recognizes
it
as
something
which
comes
from
a
certain
source.
it's
a
source
identifier.
you
have
to
show
it's
nonfunctional.
however,
trademark
law
has
been
amended,
which
specifically
says
you
have
that
burden
of
proof
if
it's
unregistered.
under
the
qualitex
case
in
my
opinion
you
have
to
show
whether
it's
competitive
necessity,
then
you've
got
to
show
whether
there's
a
likelihood
of
confusion.
you
may
have
a
product
that
looks
exactly
the
same
as
yours,
but
if
you
can't
show
there's
a
likelihood
of
confusion,
you
don't
win.
you
need
all
three
of
those
tests
in
the
trade
dress
area.
mr.
john
a.
artz
i
think
functionality,
your
honor,
legal
functionality
is
really
a
misnomer,
like
i
believe
in
the
wal-mart
case
the
secondary
meaning
was
looked
at
as
being
a
misnomer.
it
was
really
acquired
meaning,
acquired
meaning
afterwards.
legal
functionality
really
is
a
misnomer.
every
product
has
a
function.
the
coke
bottle
has
a
function,
obviously.
it's
useful,
has
a
purpose.
it's
got
a
flat
bottom
so
it
doesn't
tip
over.
it's
got
a
narrow
waist
so
you
can
grab
it,
a
narrow
spout
so
you
can
drink
it
easier,
it's
clear
so
you
can
see
it.
those
are
all
functional,
useful,
purposeful.
mr.
john
a.
artz
well,
i
think
the
functionality
test
that's
been
developed
in
qualitex
applies
to
any
type
of
trade
dress--
mr.
john
a.
artz
--i
think
the
test
that's
set
forth
in
qualitex
that
your
honor
says
is
for
just
aesthetic
functionality
applies
in
every
functionality
test.
i
think
that's
the
difference.
mr.
john
a.
artz
yes.
it
says
in
general
terms
a
product
feature
is
functional
and
cannot
serve
if,
and
then
you
say
it's
essential
to
use
or
purpose.
i
mean,
that's
broad
and
ambiguous.
everything
has
a
use
or
purpose,
and
then
you
say,
if
it
affects
the
cost
or
quality.
virtually
everything
affects
the
cost
or
quality,
so
it
seems
to
me
the
only
objective
test
you
have
here,
because
it
relates
to
competitors
and
consumers,
is
whether
or
not
it
puts
competitors
at
a
significant
disadvantage
in
the
marketplace.
mr.
john
a.
artz
yes,
it
can,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
artz
our
trade
dress,
your
honor,
it's
really
a
combination
of
five
features.
it's
got
your
x-shaped
legs,
a
narrow
base,
a
pair
of
upright
vertical
coil
springs,
an
upright
attached
to
that,
as
well
as
this
diamond-shaped
sign
above
it,
and
i
have
a
model
of
it
that
actually
shows
what
it
is
here.
this
is
in
the
record
before
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
they
could
change
any
one
of
those.
they
could
keep
the
coil
springs
if
they
change
some
other
configuration
to
make
it
look
different,
to
give
it
a
visual...
different
visual
appearance.
like,
right
now,
even
the
vice
president
and
their
technical
expert
say
that
when
they
see
a
sign
like
this
one
driving
along
the
road,
they
know
it
comes
from
marketing
displays.
they
know
it's
a
windmaster.
mr.
john
a.
artz
you
have--
mr.
john
a.
artz
--now--
mr.
john
a.
artz
--no,
they
kept
the
same
visual
appearance
and
image,
your
honor.
this
was
what
the
patent
covered
with
a
product
such
as
this.
they
could
have
gone
to
something
like
this,
with
a
wide
base,
a
pair
of
springs
way
apart,
they
could
have
gone
to
straight
legs
like
this,
they
could
have
gone
to
an
upright
like
this,
rather
than
this,
and
attached
the
sign
to
it.
this
is
what
the
patent
covered.
this
is
what
was
shown
in
the
patent.
this
is
only
found
to
infringe,
under
the
doctrine
of
equivalents,
which
took
several
years
and
several
thousands
of
dollars
for
mdi
to
prove
it,
and
that's
the
problem
with
a
per
se
test.
mr.
john
a.
artz
i
think
so.
[laughter]
mr.
john
a.
artz
well,
the
thing
here
is
a
competitive
necessity
test.
i
think
it's
important,
because
there
are
really,
like,
eight
competitors
in
this
marketplace,
mdi,
traffix,
and
six
others.
six
others
all
came
up
with
sign
stands
which
looked
different.
they
have
different
spring
mechanisms
in
particular.
there's
flat
springs,
horizontal
spring,
there's
a
torsion
spring,
and
so
traffix
said,
i
had
to
copy
mdi's,
yet
all
the
other
competitors
made
their
own
design.
they
came
up
with
sign
stands
which
look
different.
they
have
different
visual
appearance.
so
there
are
seven
types
of
sign
stands
out
there,
mdi's,
six
others,
and
then
traffix'.
mr.
john
a.
artz
that's
it,
yes.
mr.
john
a.
artz
it
does...
confusion
as
to
the
purchaser,
who
the
relevant
purchasers--
mr.
john
a.
artz
--okay.
mr.
john
a.
artz
no,
it
should
not
be
the
test.
mr.
john
a.
artz
because
i
think
what
you
say
in
the
patent
could
be
relevant,
and
the
patent
obviously
is
going
to
be
put
into
every
trade
dress
case,
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
i
think
that
trade
dress
tests,
that
their
absolute
test
is
unworkable,
because
in
every
trademark
case
now
what
you're
going
to
have
is,
a
defendant's
going
to
run
out
and
scour
the
5
million
expired
patents,
find
one
which
has
a
claim
which
may
read
on
this
trade
dress,
accused
trade
dress
and
say,
a-ha,
it's
dedicated
to
the
public
on
this
other,
somebody
else's
patent.
see,
one
of
the
things
that--
mr.
john
a.
artz
--well,
again
i
don't
want
you
to
confuse
legal
functionality
with
something
that's
useful
in
purpose,
because
legal
functionality
is
different.
it's
a
legal
test.
it
means,
as
in
the
qualitex
case,
i
believe,
or
it
means
what
is
competitive
necessity
to
use
it,
and
just
now,
recently,
in
the
1998-1999,
congress
made
amendments
to
the
lanham
act
and
it
did
not
go
for
an
absolute
test.
it
did
not
go
for
a
test
for
use
or
purpose.
what
it
did,
it
just
said,
if
it's...
you
know,
burden
of
proof
of
functionality
is
going
to
be
on
the
party
saying
it's
nonfunctional.
mr.
john
a.
artz
yes.
mr.
john
a.
artz
no.
mr.
john
a.
artz
yes.
mr.
john
a.
artz
--possibly,
in
a
bit
different
visual
image
and
appearance,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
artz
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
john
a.
artz
that's
right.
mr.
john
a.
artz
actually,
technically
it
would
make
it
less
stable.
it
would
make
it
easier,
more
easy
to
twist.
mr.
john
a.
artz
no.
they
have
an
improvement
in
performance
that
they
say
is
more
stable,
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
they
can
still
copy
it
if
it's
part
of
our
trade
dress.
there's
a...
the...
our
trade
dress
has
a
number
of
features,
as
i
mentioned
before.
it's
not
just
the
coil
springs.
they
could
use
coil
springs
close
together
as
long
as
they
change
the
base,
or
change
the
legs,
or
change
something
which
gave
it
a
different
visual
appearance
to
the
public.
one
of
the
touchstones
here
of
the
trademark
lanham
act
is
to
prevent
confusion
of
the
public,
the
public
buying
this.
you
don't
want
to
confuse
or
deceive
the
public,
which
this
does--
mr.
john
a.
artz
--that's
the
relevant
public
for
this
purpose,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
john
a.
artz
that's
correct.
mr.
john
a.
artz
yes.
mr.
john
a.
artz
correct.
mr.
john
a.
artz
yes,
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
artz
the...
yes,
legs,
the
shape,
the
base,
and
the
springs,
and
then
the
upright.
it's
a
single
upright,
too.
this
doesn't
have
the
single
upright
because
it's
a
small
model.
mr.
john
a.
artz
uh-huh.
mr.
john
a.
artz
there's
no...
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
that
these
have
a
different
visual
appearance.
one
has
a
wide
base,
one
has
a
narrow
base,
one
has
straight
legs,
one
has
x-shaped
legs.
mr.
john
a.
artz
no,
it's
what
the
legs
are
attached
to.
it
would
be
this...
this
part
in
between
the
legs,
and
here
are
the
bases.
it's
what
the
legs
are
connected
to.
mr.
john
a.
artz
well,
this,
under
the
doctrine
of
equivalents,
this
was
held
to
be
an
infringement.
but
right,
individual
appearance,
i
think
they
are
different,
and
so
from
a
trade
dress
standpoint
these
are
two
different
products.
mr.
john
a.
artz
well,
i...
whether
it's
useful,
has
a
purpose,
i
mean,
if
that's
functionality--
mr.
john
a.
artz
--well
then
the
answer,
i
agree...
i
think
is
no,
because
is
there
a
competitive
necessity
to
have
them
together?
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
john
a.
artz
only--
mr.
john
a.
artz
--it's
whether
or
not
their
whole
visual
appearance,
of
a
combination
of
five
features,
is
functional
in
the
competitive
necessity
test.
that's
why--
mr.
john
a.
artz
--not
the
legal
functionality
test--
mr.
john
a.
artz
--well,
the
problem
you
have,
your
honor,
is
that
tests...
either
the
government's
test
or
traffix'
test
is
going
to
be
unworkable,
because
you
could
have
company
a
that
makes
this
product,
or
comes
up
with
this
idea,
company
b.
company
a
gets
a
patent
on
it,
goes
17
years.
company
b
doesn't
get
a
patent,
and
gets
trade
dress
protection
on
it,
and
yet
company
a
for
some
reason
doesn't
sue
them,
but
when
this
patent
expires,
that
means
all
the
trade
dress
that
company
b
has
developed
over
all
those
years
is
shot.
it's
out
the
window,
because
it
happens
to
be
the
subject
of
a
patent.
see,
that's
a
problem
with
this
per
se
test
that
they're
saying.
mr.
john
a.
artz
that's
true.
mr.
john
a.
artz
uh-huh.
mr.
john
a.
artz
well,
the
patent
covered
some
other
things
other
than
that.
they
had
to
have
initial
compression
along
the
coils
of
the
spring.
they
also
had
to
meet
a
certain
geometric
relationship
with
the
center
of
gravity--
mr.
john
a.
artz
--well,
that's
the
doctrine
of
equivalents,
and--
mr.
john
a.
artz
--one
language
of
the
claim
which
calls
for
spaced-apart
springs,
and
then
we--
mr.
john
a.
artz
--it
was
equivalent
from
a
patent
standpoint
whether
two
springs
together
were
the
equivalent
of
two
springs
spaced
apart.
mr.
john
a.
artz
that
was
that
issue.
mr.
john
a.
artz
that's
only
one
of
several
issues
in
that
patent
case,
and
the
fact
that
the
others
happened
to
use
this
coil
spring,
they
used
the
other
parts,
that
shows
you
that
you
can
change
one
or
two
parts
of
this
particular
trade
dress
and
comes
up...
have
something
that
looks
completely
different.
in
that
case,
the
competitors
made
a
flat
spring,
they
had
a
horizontal
spring,
they
put
two
springs
at
45-degree
angles,
you
could
change
the
legs,
you
could
change
the
upright...
all
of
those
might
give
a
different
visual
impression.
that's
what
the
sixth
circuit
said.
see,
the
district
court
in
this
case
concentrated
on
just
the
two
springs,
and
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
was
not
proper
because
it's
the
overall
appearance,
visual,
visual
and
image
of
the
product
which
really
controls.
you
can't
look
at
one--
mr.
john
a.
artz
--all
right.
mr.
john
a.
artz
as
long
as
you
don't
confuse
the
patent
law
with
the
trade
dress
law,
your
honor,
two
separate
and
distinct,
but
from
a
patent
law
standpoint
you're
right,
but
not
from
the
trade
dress
standpoint.
there's
another...
right
now
we're
looking
at
the
public
domain,
and
the
difference
is
where
it
comes
from.
if
it
comes
from
a
patent,
it's
given
special
recognition.
you
can't
use
it
for
the
trade
dress,
but
if
it
doesn't,
then
you
can
use
it.
now,
that
to
me
is
not
a
real
consistent...
not
a
real
consistent
argument.
you
also
have
the
fact
that
as...
where
do
you
look
at
the
trade
dress
and
this
functionality,
look
at
one
patent,
look
at
two
patents,
what
if
there
are
several
patents
that
show
it.
you
know,
what
if
you
don't
even
own
the
patents?
what
if
we
were
just
a
licensee
and
asserted
it?
what
if
you
didn't
own
it?
would
that
make
a
difference,
or
if
a
third
party
owns
the
patent.
there
are
several
things,
questions
we
raise
at
the
back
of
our
brief
that
traffix
and
the
government
really
can't
answer.
they
really
do
admit
that
if
someone
is
the
subject
matter
of
one
patent
by
one
person,
and
it
expires,
somebody
else's
trade
dress
will
expire.
i
mean,
right
now
we
also
have
a
situation
where
they're
trying
to
get
special
protection
for
utility
patents,
which
is
different
than,
for
example,
for
design
patents.
or,
talk
about
something
being
nonfunctional,
design
patenting
in
which
having
this
right,
as
you
mentioned
before,
of
an
exclusive
period
of
14
years
develop
secondary
meaning.
there's
no
question
whatsoever
that
courts
do
allow
parties
to
get
trade
dress
protection
in
such
a
matter
of
design
patents,
and
there
you've
got
this
secondary
meaning
over
14
years
in
which
you've
used
it
exclusively,
and
that
goes
to
the
look
and
appearance
of
the
product,
but
there's
no
problem
with
having
trade
dress
protection
afterwards
because
it
isn't
functional,
so
why
should
utility
patents
be
treated
any
differently?
and
as
i
said
initially,
there
are
different
areas
of
intellectual
property
law,
you
have
different
standards,
different
tests,
different
remedies.
you
know,
in
trade
dress
law
you
have...
in
trademark
law
you
have
much
different
remedies
to
protect
the
public
and
consumers.
here--
mr.
john
a.
artz
--thank
you,
your
honor.
