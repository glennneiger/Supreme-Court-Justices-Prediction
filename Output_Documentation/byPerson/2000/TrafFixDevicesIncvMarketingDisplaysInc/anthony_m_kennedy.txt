so
under
your
view
of
the
case,
if
the
legs
that
the
patentee
had
had
a
very
special
color,
like
the
john
deere
green
or
something,
that
could
be
copied
after
the
patent
ran?
because
i
notice--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
the
pictures
the
legs
were
orange
in
your
client's
stand
and
aluminum
in
the
other.
justice

justice
o'connor's
question
suggests
this
to
me.
you're
arguing
for
the
rule
that
you
maintain
here
so
that
you
will
not
have
to
litigate
functionality.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
why
isn't
functionality
sufficient
protection,
particularly
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
your
position
is
the
utilitarian
feature
of
the
patent
is
a
conclusive
presumption
in
a
trade
dress
suit
where
functionality
would
otherwise
be
at
issue?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i've
been
looking
in
the
last
week.
it's
very
interesting.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
would
seem
to
me
that
would
be,
even
under
your
rule,
a...
well,
maybe
not
under
your,
but
under
the
government's
rule,
quite
an
appropriate
thing
to
do,
to
show
that
there
is
functionality
that
the
patent
office
has
recognized.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
temporary
road
sign
with
warnings
like,
road
work
ahead
or
left
shoulder
closed,
must
withstand
strong
gusts
of
wind.
now,
this
case
begins
with
two
patterns
for
a
device
that
cam
keep
those
signs
standing
despite
the
wind
and
the
pattern
involve
two
vertical
springs
and
the
parties
call
as
the
dual-spring
design.
if
you
develop
an
absorbing
interest
in
this
subject
let
us
caution
you
against
looking
for
the
dual-springs
while
you
are
driving
by.
to
begin
with,
the
springs
are
behind
the
sign
so
you
have
to
look
backward.
secondly,
they
are
at
base
of
the
sign
it
is
difficult
to
see
so
you
have
to
stop
your
car,
get
out
and
look,
but
if
you
do
you
would
probably
be
rewarded
by
seeing
the
dual-spring
design.
the
patterns
in
question
gave
protection
of
the
dual-spring
design
to
a
company
called
marketing
displays
inc.
known
as
mdi.
when
the
patents
expired
the
company
called
traffix
became
a
competitor
of
mdi’s
and
used
the
same
dual-spring
design.
the
two
stands
looked
alike
and
that
is
because
they
were
because
traffix
had
copied
mdi’s
stand.
mdi
could
not
sue
for
patent
infringement
since
the
patents
had
expired,
but,
it
did
sue
traffix
for
infringing
on
its
trade
dress.
mdi
said
that
this
was
its
exclusive
trade
dress,
the
dual-spring
design
and
that
its
customers
identified
mdi
with
it.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
there
was
a
material
issue
fact
and
that
mdi
could
go
to
trial
in
order
to
establish
its
trade
dress
was
not
functional
and
that
it
had
a
secondary
meaning.
we
now
reverse.
it
is
well
established
that
trade
dress
can
be
protected
under
federal
law.
trade
dress
however
does
not
extend
to
product
design
features
that
are
functional.
under
the
lanham
act,
the
federal
statute
which
confirms
trade
dress
protection,
the
party
who
seeks
to
establish
trade
protection
must
bear
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
product
feature
is
nonfunctional.
an
expired
utility
patent
has
vital
significance
in
this
inquiry
a
utility
patent
is
strong
evidence;
the
features
claimed
in
the
patent
are
functional.
a
trade
dress
protection
is
sought
for
those
features
as
it
was
for
the
dual-spring
design
in
this
case,
the
strong
evidence
of
functionality
based
on
the
expired
utility
patent
has
great
weight
to
the
statutory
presumptions
that
features
are
deemed
functional
until
the
party
is
seeking
the
trade
dress
protection
can
establish
nonfunctionality.
the
rule
we
have
explained
bars
the
trade
dress
claim
here
for
mdi
did
not
and
cannot
carry
the
burden
of
overcoming
the
strong
evidence
and
a
strong
evidentiary
inference
of
functionality.
thereby
the
court
of
appeals
in
giving
insufficient
recognition
to
the
importance
of
the
expired
utility
patents
and
there
evidentiary
significance
was
likely
caused
by
its
misinterpretation
of
trade
dress
principles
in
other
respects.
the
court
of
appeals
seem
to
regard
our
recent
opinion
in
qualitex
company
v.
jacobson
products
as
mandating
that
a
necessary
test
for
functionality
is
whether
the
particular
product
configuration
is
a
competitive
necessity.
this
was
incorrect
as
a
comprehensive
definition.
a
feature
is
also
functional
when
it
is
essential
to
the
use
or
purpose
of
the
device
or
when
it
affects
the
cost
or
quality
of
the
device
and
qualitex
did
not
purport
to
displace
this
traditional
rule.
and
the
fact
that
the
dual-spring
design
is
functional
means
that
there
is
no
need
to
engage
in
speculation
about
other
design
possibilities
such
as
the
use
of
three
or
four
springs
or
hiding
the
springs.
it
would
be
a
cross
purposes
to
the
laws
objective
and
something
of
a
paradox,
were
we
to
require
the
manufacturer
to
conceal
the
very
item
that
the
user
seeks.
a
different
result
may
obtain
in
a
case
where
a
manufacturer
attempts
to
protect
arbitrary,
incidental
or
ornamental
aspects
of
the
features
of
the
product
found
in
the
patent
claims.
there
the
manufacturer
could
perhaps
prove
that
those
aspects
do
not
serve
a
purpose
within
the
terms
of
the
utility
pattern.
no
such
claim
is
made
here
however
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
is
reversed.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
