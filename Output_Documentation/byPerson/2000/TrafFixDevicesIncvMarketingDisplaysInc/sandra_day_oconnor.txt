mr.
roberts,
how
do
we
determine
what
the
patent
covers?
does
it...
i
mean,
i
can
look
at
it,
but
i'm
still
not
sure.
i
think
in
the
record,
in
the
material
here,
we
have
a
copy.
does
it
include
in
this
case
the
legs
and
the
whole
structure,
or
just
the
dual
spring,
and
how
do
we
normally
determine
what
the
patent
covers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
whole
thing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
legs,
spring,
and
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--does
it
depend
in
part
on
how
we
define
functionality
under
the
trade
dress
inquiry?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
think
that
there
can
never
be
a
trade
dress
protection
in
some
aspect
of
an
expired
patented
item?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
there
could
be
a
trade
dress
in
an
expired
patented
item.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
suppose
that
depends
on
how
we
define
functionality,
in
a
sense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
the
court,
the
sixth
circuit
pulled
that
out
of
qualitex'
opinion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
competitive
need.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
as
far
as
you're
concerned,
if
it's
useful,
then
it's
functional?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
a
touchstone
of
patent
law
that
an
expired
patent
can
be
copied,
so
we
really
do
have
to
make
the
two
doctrines
mesh
well.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
concern
we
have
is
with
this
expanded
competitive
need
test
that
some
of
the
lower
courts
have
begun
employing,
and
i
am
quite
interested
to
know
how
you
think
the
two
doctrines
can
fit
neatly
together,
because
in
an
ideal
world
a
trade
dress
could
not
cover
something
that
was
covered
by
a
patent
that's
now
expired.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it's
possible
that
some
of
the
courts
have
lowered
the
bar
too
much
on
the
functionality
inquiry.
i
mean,
i
think
that's
what
we
need
to
look
at.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
public
isn't
buying
it.
it's
highway
departments
that
are
buying
it.
the
public
isn't
buying
this
sign,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
it's
the
highway
department
purchasers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
doesn't
the
state
typically
regulate
the
shape
of
the
sign,
as
justice
scalia
asked
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
diamond
shape
indicates
a
certain
kind
of
warning,
does
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
they
can
use
that
shape
and
color,
presumably.
that's
necessary.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
what
are
we
arguing
about,
the
legs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
obviously
you're
holding
up
one
that's
a
rectangle,
so
it
makes
sense
to
have
the
posts
on
either
side,
as
opposed
to
the
diamond
shape,
where
it
makes
sense
to
have
it
in
the
middle.
i
mean,
you're
not
showing
us
an
equivalent-shaped
sign.
