justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
difficulty,
i
guess
is,
would
you
make
the
test
absolute,
because
if
you
make
it
absolute,
you
know,
you're
going
to
get
into
huge
litigation
about
whether
this
thing
in
the
patent
was
or
it
was
not
an
essential
element,
and
then
somebody
will
say,
oh
yeah,
i
guess
i
did
include
it
as
one
of
the
specifications
in
the
patent,
but
it
really
wasn't
that
important.
i
mean,
should
you
make
it
absolute
never,
or
should
you
allow
somebody
to
defend
on
the
ground
that,
look,
it
wasn't
that
crucial
to
the
patent,
and
everybody's
come
to
identify
it,
and
please
let
me
make
an
exception
here,
and
then
they
give
some
fabulous
reasons.
should
it
be
absolute,
or
leave
them
a
little
bit
of
a
loophole?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
goes
both
ways,
because
if
you
allow
no
loophole
you're
going
to
get
the
same
kind
of
arguments
about
whether
it
was
or
was
not
an
essential
part
of
a
patent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
this
case
it
may
be
easy,
but
the
question
is,
what
about
the
rule?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
you
go
back
to
justice
o'connor,
which
i
thought
was
the
key
question,
and
i
didn't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--hear
the
answer.
i
mean,
i
know
qualitex.
i'm
surprised
not
at
your
reading,
because
that's
your
job,
but
i'm
pretty
surprised
at
the
tenth
circuit,
the
court,
which...
i
learned
you
read
the
whole
case,
what
the
context
is
not
just
a
sentence
taken
out
of
context,
so
i
obviously
thought
that
qualitex
was
about
a
doctrine
called
aesthetic
functionality.
i
thought,
on
page
165
where
the
court
quotes
the
tradition,
what's
in
quotes,
the
definition,
a
product
feature
is
functional
if
it
is
essential
to
the
use
or
purpose
of
this
article,
all
in
quotes,
or
if
it
affects
the
cost
or
quality
of
the
article,
okay,
end
of
the
matter.
now
it
adds,
because
that's
what
happens
to
be
relevant
to
aesthetic
functionality,
that
is,
if
exclusive
use
of
the
feature
would
put
competitors
at
a
significant
nonreputational
disadvantage.
that
last
clause
is
relevant
to
what
happens
to
be
the
subject
of
this
case,
called
aesthetic
functionality.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
two
pages
later,
in
case
that
wasn't
clear,
the
case
quotes
restatement
third
about
aesthetic
functionality
and
says,
in
respect
to
aesthetic
functionality,
i.e.,
color,
quote,
the
ultimate
test
is
whether
the
recognition
of
trademark
rights
would
significantly
hinder
competition,
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
nothing
in
the
case--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--purports
to
change
any
earlier
test
in
respect
to
anything
else--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
even
change
anything
there,
so
as
i
read
the
case
that
seemed
to
be
its
reading,
which
would
say
in
this
case,
which
isn't
about
aesthetic
functionality,
we
apply
what
is
the
traditional
test.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe,
but
i
thought
the
place
you
look
for
a
test
is
in
the
supreme
court
opinions,
and
in
the
supreme
court
opinions,
qualitex
quotes
the
traditional
test.
it
didn't
make
it
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
said,
in
general
terms
a
product
feature
is
functional
if
it
is
essential
to
the
use
or
purpose
of
this
article,
or
it
affects
the
cost
or
quality
of
the
article.
that's
all
in
quotes.
the
rest
is
explanation
as
applied
here.
so
if
we
take
that
as
the
test,
why
isn't
that
the
test?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
was
my
question.
my
question
was
as
to
that
add-on,
doesn't
that
have
to
do
with
an
explanation
of
the
test
as
relevant
to
the
issue
before
the
court
in
qualitex--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--namely,
aesthetic
functionality,
which
is
an
aspect
of
quality
i
think
people
could
argue
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
test
in
the
case
of
aesthetic
functionality?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
is
this
a
case
of
aesthetic
functionality?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
aesthetic?
it
involves
color?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
everything
in
design
involves
how
things
look.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
aesthetic
functionality
isn't
conceivably
in
this
case.
they're
the
ones
that
argue
functionality,
not
you.
they're
the
ones
that
say
that
the
product
is
functional.
they're
not
saying
that
the
functionality
of
your
product
arises
from
the
way
it
looks.
they're
not
saying,
like
color,
it
warns
people
that
the
boat's
black.
they're
saying
that
the
functionality
of
the
product
is
that
the
springs
prevent
it
from
twisting
in
the
wind.
now,
that
isn't
a
claim
of
aesthetic
functionality,
and
i
don't
see
how
you
could
even
closely
claim
that
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah,
wait.
i
thought
what
you
said
is,
you
agreed
with
me
before
that
qualitex
is
talking
about
aesthetic
functionality,
that
we
apply
the
normal
test
without
that
little
add-on,
but
we
apply
restatement
three,
the
aesthetic
functionality
test,
which
is
the
add-on,
where
they
make
the
claim
that
the
reason
this
product
is
functional
is
because
of
the
way
it
looks,
i.e.,
the
pipes
are
painted
orange
as
a
warning,
which
is
not
their
claim
in
this
case.
am
i...
now,
where
am
i
wrong
in
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
the
pages
written
at
169
and
170,
and
trying
to
explain
just
what
we're
driving
at
are
sort
of
beside
the
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
patent
part?
i'd
like
to
ask
you
about
the
patent
part,
and
will
you
assume
for
purpose
of
this
that
qualitex
is
about
color,
which
is
a
matter
that
doesn't
easily
fit
within
the
terms,
you
know,
purpose,
use,
cost
or
quality,
and
suppose
here
we're
dealing
with
something
that
does
easily
fit
within
those
terms,
all
right,
so
keep
qualitex
out
of
it.
now,
assuming
that
that's
so,
what
would
be
wrong...
and
they
come
in
and
they
say,
look,
these
springs
are
part
of
the
function.
they're
part
of
the
function.
they're
essential
to
the
use,
these
springs,
in
this
way.
now,
should
there
be
an
absolute
presumption
that
if
you
one
day
said...
i'm
not
saying
what
you
did
say,
but
we'll
assume
this.
if
you
one
day
said
in
the
patent
application,
i
have
a
great
idea
here,
and
my
idea
is
to
have
two
springs
just
like
this,
and
then
later
on,
when
it's
expired,
they
say,
that
was
the
heart
of
it.
it
was
useful.
should
the
fact
that
you
said
that
one
day
in
the
patent
be
the
end
of
the
matter,
nobody
ever
looks
further?
there
is
a...
what
the
government
said
here
is
where
as
an
expired
utility
patent
discloses
that
the
feature
alleges
trade
dress
contributes
to
the
operation
of
the
formerly
patented
device,
the
feature
must
be
considered
function.
now,
that's
the
government's
suggestion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
you
can
of
course
argue
that
wasn't
essential,
et
cetera,
but
my
problem's
a
general
one,
leaving
this
case
out
of
it.
should
that
be
the
test?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't...
i
thought
as
a
factual
matter
that
there
are
five
features
in
your
patent,
including
the
legs,
all
the
other
things
of
appearance,
but
the
district
court
found
that
there
are
a
lot
of
other
competitors
that
have
every
one
of
those
features,
so
it's
not
unique
but
for
the
spaced-apart
coil
springs,
so
that
all
were...
is
that
true?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
all
we're
talking
about...
and
then
i
thought
also
as
a
factual
matter
that
somebody
before
the
patent
expired
used
those
two
spaced-apart
springs
in
that
narrow
configuration
that
your
finger's
on
right
now.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
sued
them,
and
it
was
found
in
your
claim,
in
your
view,
those
spaced-apart
that
much,
not
wide
apart,
violated
your
patent,
and
you
won.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they
didn't
get
out
of
it...
they
didn't
get
out
of
your
patent,
because
the
springs
were
close
together
rather
than
being
far
apart.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right,
so
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yeah.
