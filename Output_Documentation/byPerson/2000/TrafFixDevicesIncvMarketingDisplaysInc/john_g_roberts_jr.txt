chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
president
and
founder
of
marketing
displays,
incorporated,
mdi,
invented
a
new
type
of
sign
stand,
one
with
a
dual-spring
design
that
allowed
the
stand
to
resist
the
wind.
mdi
patented
that
invention
and,
for
the
term
of
its
patents,
mdi
labeled
its
sign
stands
as
patent-protected
to
warn
of
copiers,
touted
in
its
trade
literature
the
benefit
of
its,
quote,
patented
dual-spring
design,
end
quote,
and
when
another
company,
windproof,
tried
to
market
a
copy
of
mdi's
patented
stand,
mdi
sued
it
for
patent
infringement
and
won.
but
then
mdi's
patents
expired,
as
under
the
constitution
all
patents
eventually
must.
sometime
thereafter,
traffix
devices,
the
petitioner,
copied
mdi's
stand,
added
some
improvements
of
its
own,
and
marketed
a
competing
version.
no
longer
armed
with
its
patents,
mdi
tried
a
new
tack
to
exclude
competition.
it
claimed
that
the
configuration
of
its
stand,
the
same
dual-spring
design
that
it
had
touted
as
patent-protected
during
the
term
of
the
patents,
was
protected
as
trade
dress
and
could
not
be
copied.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
in
this
case,
of
course,
it's
easy
to
determine
that
the
patent
covers
this
particular
sign
stand
because
mdi
labeled
that
sign
stand
as
patent-protected.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
whole
sign
stand,
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
all,
but
in
its
trade
literature,
for
example,
it
focused
on
the
dual-spring
design.
that
is
what
makes
the
invention
work.
that's
what
allows
it
to
resist
the
wind,
and
it
said,
this
is
our
patented
dual-spring
design
and,
of
course,
it
not
only
labeled
the
stands
but
in
its
trade
literature,
and
in
the
windproof
case
it
sued
when
somebody
made
an
exact
replica,
the
same
replica
that
traffix
devices--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
incidental
ornamentation
that
is
not
part
of
what
the
patent
protects
does
not
give
rise
to
the
right
to
copy.
there
should
be
an
exact
symmetry.
whatever
the
patent
had
protected
as
part
of
the
patent
bargain,
the
public
has
the
right
to
copy.
now,
the
color
of
the
legs
probably
would
not
have
been
claimed
in
the
patent,
and
wouldn't
have
been
part
of
the
invention,
and
therefore
it
would
not
give
rise
to
a
right
to
copy
that
color.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
depends
on
which
stand
is
involved.
the
steel
stand
is
one
color
and
the
aluminum
stand
is
another,
but
in
terms
of
what
they
claimed
in
the
patent
as...
the
part
that
makes
the
invention
work,
it's
not
the
legs
that
made
this
invention.
it's
not
the
sign.
it
is
the
dual-spring
design.
that's
what
they
said
was
patented.
when
they
marketed
this,
when
they
had
the
exclusive
right
to
do
so,
they
focused
on
that
in
their
trade
literature,
said
this
is
our
patented
dual-spring
design,
and
that
is
the
same
claim
they
now
raise
in
their
trade
dress
assertion.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
said
we...
it
said
we
basically
had
to
design
around
their
stand.
now,
if
they
said,
you
could
use
three
springs
or
four
springs,
i
guess
it
would
never
end,
five
springs,
or
you
could
put
a
little
skirt
around
the
springs
so
people
wouldn't
see
them,
or,
as
your
honor
points
out,
if
you're
going
to
use
the
springs
you
have
to
change
something
else
so
it
doesn't
look
like
it.
but
that's
not
what
this
court's
cases
have
held.
what
the
court
has
said,
singer
and
kellogg
and
sears,
is
that
the
public
has
the
right
to
copy
the
patented
invention
in
precisely
the
form
in
which
it
was
practiced,
and
that's
critically
important.
the
idea
of
designing
around
what
had
previously
been
patented
is
a
significant
hindrance
to
competition,
and
this
case
is
a
good
example.
when
we
copied
the
sign
we
added
an
important
improvement
of
our
own,
the
step-and-drop
leg.
under
mdi's
stand
you
have
to
bend
over
and
pull
the
pins
out.
under
ours,
you
just
step
and
the
legs
come
out.
now,
if
the
rule
were
the
rule
that
the
respondents
are
arguing
for,
we
would
have
had
to
add
that
new
improvement
to
some
different
sign
stand,
but
the
right
to
copy
attaches
to
the
product
as
it
was
practiced
during
the
term
of
the
patent.
we
don't
have
to
design
around
their
superior
stand...
that's
why
it
succeeded
in
getting
the
patent...
to
add
improvements
of
our
own.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
think
there
is
a
freestanding
right
to
copy
from
an
expired
patent,
that
it
doesn't
depend
upon
what
functionality
is.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
the
item
was
simply
incidental
ornamentation...
one
of
their
amici
used
the
example,
if
you're
patenting
a
chair
and
the
drawing
shows
a
purple
bow.
well,
we
don't
think
there's
a
right
to
copy
the
purple
bow,
because
the
purple
bow
is
not
covered.
that's
not
the
invention.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the
item
itself,
yes,
but
not
in
the
subject
of
the
patent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
functionality
i
think
leads
to
the
same
place
that
we
come
to
from
looking
at
patent
law,
if
you
define
functionality
as
it
has
traditionally
been
defined,
as
turning
on
usefulness.
if
functional...
if
functional
means
useful,
then
our
case
comes
out
the
same
way,
because
you
have
to
be
useful
to
get
a
patent,
and
if
it's
been
the
subject
of
a
patent,
the
feature
has
been
useful,
therefore
it's
functional,
therefore
it's
not
eligible
for
trade
dress
protection.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
exactly,
and
functionality--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--functionality
is
sufficient
if
functionality
means
useful,
but
if
functionality
means,
as
the
lower
court
said
in
this
case,
something
for
which
there
is
a
competitive
need,
or
for
which
there
are
not
available
alternatives,
and
there's
a
multi-factor
balancing
test
to
determine
so-called
legal
functionality--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
we--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
don't
think
qualitex
opined
on
the
exact
definition
of
functionality
in
this
case,
or
it
was
misread
by
the
lower
court.
the
definition
in
qualitex
had
a
very
important
connector
there.
it
said,
a
useful
product
feature,
or,
and
then
it
went
on
to
talk
about
competitive
need,
so--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--period,
without
regard
to
competitive
need,
available
alternatives...
mdi's
position
is,
look,
you
can
make
a
sign
that
stands
up
to
the
wind
that's
just
as
good
as
our
sign
stand,
so
don't
make
it
the
way
we
made
it,
but
the
patent,
the
expired
patent
gives
us
the
right
to
copy--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
justice
brandeis'
opinion
in
kellogg
answers
that.
kellogg
did
not
have
to
show
that
there
was
no
way
to
make
or
sell
shredded
wheat
other
than
in
the
pillow-shaped
biscuit
form
that
nabisco
had
made
famous
when
it
had
its
patent.
it
was
enough
that
that
was
the
form
in
which
nabisco
had
practiced
its
patent.
kellogg
therefore
could
copy
it,
even
though
they
could
have
made
shredded
wheat
some
other
way,
and
that's
important
precisely
because
of
the
purpose
of
the
patent
bargain
to
promote
competition.
as
i
said,
why...
if
we
have
an
improvement
to
this
sign
stand,
the
step-and-drop
legs,
why
should
we
have
to
add
it
only
to
a
very
different
sign
stand?
it's
the
commercially
proven
version
that
the
public
has
the
right
to
copy.
that
is
important
to
enhance
competition.
to
require
people,
if
they're
going
to
make
improvements,
to
design
around
the
form
that
the
public
had
become
accustomed
to,
would
inhibit
competition,
and--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
you're
dealing
with
what
is
in
the
trade
dress
area
essentially
judge-made
law,
and
it
has
expanded
in
various
ways,
and
functionality...
it
doesn't
interfere
with
the
patent
bargain
if
functionality
means
a
broad
range
of
other
things,
but
so
long
as
it
is
also
satisfied
completely
by
a
demonstration
that
it
is
a
useful
product
feature.
there
may
be
other
limitations
on
a
trade
dress
claim
going
to
competitive
need,
available
alternatives,
any
of
the
various
multi-factor
tests,
but
if
functionality
is
going
to
serve
the
purpose
of
demarking
the
regime
of
trademark
and
trade
dress
and
patent
law,
it
must
be
satisfied
by
a
showing
that
it
is
a
useful
product
feature
and
in
our
case
that's
significant,
because
you
can't
get
a
utility
patent
as
mdi
had,
without
showing
that
it's
a
useful
product
feature,
so
the
fact
that
they
had
a
utility
patent,
that
it
covered
the
dual-spring
design,
should
be
enough
to
establish
functionality
and
therefore
should
be
enough
to
reject
their
trade
dress
claim.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
it
is
the
expansion
of
the
concept
of
configuration
trade
dress
that
has
given
rise
to
this
issue
and
the
problem.
if
you
go
back
to
where
trademark
was
limited
to
marks
on
the
product,
of
course,
the
product
could
be
patented,
the
trademark
is
fine.
if
you
even
then
go
the
next
step,
and
you're
talking
about
trade
dress
and
packaging,
again,
so
long
as
it's
distinct
from
the
product,
there's
no
interference
with
patent.
but
when
you
start
saying
that
the
configuration
of
the
product
itself
is
entitled
to
protection
as
trade
dress,
you
bump
right
into
the
patent
law,
because
the
key
to
the
patent
bargain
is,
if
you're
going
to
control
a
useful
product
feature,
as
the
court
said
in
qualitex,
that's
the
regime
of
patent
law,
and
it's
no
answer
to
say,
well,
we're
protected
by
patent
law
and
when
the
patent
expires
we're
protected
under
trade
dress
law,
because
that
takes
away
the
public's
half
of
the
patent
bargain.
we're
giving
exclusive
right
to
an
inventor
for
a
term
of
years
on
the
condition
that
he
or
she
disclose
what
the
invention
is,
and
that
the
public
obtains
a
right
to
copy
it
when
the
patent
expires.
so
yes,
i
mean,
it
is
the
expansion
of
product
configuration
trade
dress
that
has
given
rise
to
this
problem,
and
i
would
at
least
suggest
that
the
court
should
not
get
on
board
with
that
expansion
without
waiting
for
congress
to
say
something
about
it,
particularly
given
the
fact
that
it
so
directly
impinges
upon
the
central
patent
bargain
underlying
the
patent
system.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
certainly,
yes,
and--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
it
gives
rise
to
an
important
distinction.
in
other
words,
having
been
covered
by
the
patent,
another
producer
knows
that
when
it
comes
off
patent
he
can
copy
it,
and
that's
how
it
worked
in
this
case.
traffix
devices
knew...
they
were
in
the
business...
this
was
a
patented
sign
stand,
they
couldn't
make
it,
it
comes
off
patent,
they
can
make
it.
now,
if
they
at
that
point
had
to...
instead,
if
respondent's
position
were
adopted,
they
had
to
go
to
their
lawyer
and
say,
is
this
legally
functional,
their
lawyer
would
tell
them,
well,
it
depends.
there
are
six
factors
in
this
circuit,
there
are
eight
factors
in
the
other
circuit.
we've
got
to
get
expert
economic
testimony.
it
depends
on
consumer
surveys.
by
that
time
the
producer
says,
forget
it,
it's
not
worth
the
candle,
i'll
go
make
something
else,
and
competition
suffers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
know,
a
little
bit
of
a
loophole
suddenly
expands,
particularly
when
you
have
a
multi--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
of
course,
in
this
case
it's
easy.
the
key
to
the
invention--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
producers
all
the
time
compete
all
the
time
in
the
confines
of
patents.
they
have
to
look
at
a
patent
and
decide,
can
i
make
a
competing
product
or
not,
so
it's
not
a
new
inquiry,
and
in
the
typical
case
such
as
this,
where
you
have
a
product
coming
off
patent,
you
will
have
the
conduct
of
the
patentee,
which
will
illuminate
exactly
what
he
thought
was
covered.
here,
we
not
only
have
the
labeling
and
the
trade
literature,
we
have
the
windproof
litigation.
someone
made
the
exact
same
sign
here
and
he
said,
a-ha,
that
infringes
my
patent.
well,
if
it
did
infringe
his
patent,
and
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
it
did,
then
the
public
has
a
right
to
copy.
i'd
like
to
reserve--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
the
patent
displays
what
they
call
a
business
sign,
with
two
springs
far
apart.
the
traffix
sign,
the
one
at
issue
in
windproof
and
at
issue
here,
the
springs
are
closely
together.
mdi
argued
successfully
that
made
no
difference,
that
the
two
closely
spaced
springs
were
covered
by
the
patent
to
the
same
extent
as
the
farther
apart
springs.
thank
you,
your
honor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
there
was
until
this
morning
no
dispute
that
moving
the
springs
closer
together
was
functional.
if
you
look
at
petition
appendix
page
54a,
there
is
the
explanation
from
mdi's
chief
engineer
that
doing
so
makes
the
sign
more
compact
and
weighs
less,
very
important
if
you're
ferrying
these
things
up
and
down
the
highway,
and
also
makes
it
less
expensive
to
manufacture.
as
far
as
the
two
different
sign
stands,
the
diamond
one
with
the
closely
spaced
springs,
joint
appendix
page
236,
mdi
said
that
those
signs,
even
though
the
other
one
was
depicted
in
their
patent,
that
the
closely
spaced
springs
were,
quote,
slavish
copies
from
the
standpoint
of
function
of
the
sign
stand
described
and
claimed
in
the
sartesian
patents.
third,
that
is
the
form
in
which
they
practiced
their
patent,
the
closely
spaced
springs.
kellogg,
singer,
sears,
that
line
of
cases
gives
traffix
devices
and
any
member
of
the
public
the
right
to
copy
the
patent
in
the
form
in
which
it
was
practiced.
that
is
critically
important
to
maintain
competition.
whether
you
begin
with
patent
law
and
the
right
to
copy
from
an
expired
patent,
or
trade
dress
law
and
the
definition
of
functionality
that
focuses
on
usefulness,
is
it
a
useful
product
figure,
you
come
to
the
same
point.
traffix
devices
had
the
right
to
copy
the
mdi
sign
stand
when
it
came
off
patent,
and
it
did
so.
it
did
so
in
the
way
bonito
boats
explains
enhances
competition,
imitation
and
refinement
through
imitation
by
adding
an
improvement
of
its
own
that
made
a
more
competitive
product
better
for
highway
safety
departments.
