of
course,
mr.
roberts,
you
rely
heavily
on
the
patent
in
this
case,
and
that's
the
question
presented.
you've
presented
only
that
narrow
question.
but
i
take
it
you
would
argue
even
if
there
had
been
no
patent
issued
in
this
case,
no
patent
application,
that
this
was
nevertheless
functional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
fact
of
the
patent
really
is
just
evidentiary
support
for
the
ultimate
conclusion
that
this
is
a
functional
feature.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
know,
i
have
to
confess
that
i'm...
i
find
it
a
little
difficult
to
imagine
that
most
motorists
are
looking
at
what...
the
legs
of
the
sign
instead
of
the
message
on
the
sign.
[laughter]
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
people
really
identify
with
two
legs
or
three.
i
don't
have
the
slightest
idea
how
many
legs
there
were
on
most
of
the
signs
i've
looked
at
when
i
was
driving
along.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
you
a
minute
ago
acknowledged
that
if
the
two
springs
were
closer
together
it
would
be
less
wind-resistant
than
otherwise,
which
seems
to
me
demonstrates
it
has
some
functional
significance
whether
they're
close
or
not.
if
one
is
a...
better
resistant
to
the
wind
than
the
other,
doesn't...
isn't
that
functional,
isn't
that
enough
to
prove
functionality?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
under
all
these
tests,
but
why
shouldn't
it
be
enough?
the
government
argues
that
the
competitive
need
is
a
sufficient
proof
but
not
a
necessary
proof
of
it
as
a
defense
to
the
trade
dress
argument.
