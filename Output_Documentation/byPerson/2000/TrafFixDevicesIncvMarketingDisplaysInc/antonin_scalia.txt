mr.
wallace,
i'm
not
sure
what
your
proposal
is,
that
we
use
the
simple
test
for
what,
for
useful
features--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whether
or
not
they
are
patented,
and
the
more
complex
test
for...
for
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
may
be
separate
and
distinct,
but
they
bear
upon
one
another,
and
there
seems
to
be
something
horribly
unfair
about
allowing
someone
who
has
acquired
a
secondary
meaning
in
the
trade
dress
only
because
of
the
patent...
let's
say
the
shape
of
a
coca-cola
bottle.
i
mean,
you
know,
if
that
wasn't
patented,
somebody
else
could
have
come
out
with
the
same
shape
bottle
as
soon
as
it...
you
know,
as
soon
as
the
first
ones
came
off
the
line
they
could
say,
gee,
that's
a
nice-looking
bottle,
and
they
could
have
copied
it,
but
you
couldn't
copy
it
because
it
was
patented,
and
therefore,
by
reason
of
the
patent,
for
17
years
coca-cola
acquires
a
secondary
meaning.
anyone
who
sees
that
bottle
would
say,
it's
coca-cola.
then,
when
the
patent
expires,
coca-cola
in
effect
extends
the
patent
by
parlaying
what
was
the
design
patent
into
what
is
now
trade
dress
protection,
because
they
say,
well,
gee,
everybody
knows
that
that's
a
coca-cola
bottle,
but
the
only
reason
they
know
is
because
you've
been
given
a
monopoly
for
17
years,
and
it
doesn't
seem
right
to
enable
you
to
extend
that
monopoly
indefinitely.
the
only
reason
you
acquired
the
secondary
meaning
was
because
of
the
patent.
that's
unlike
other
companies
that
get
secondary
meanings
without
a
patent.
doesn't
there
seem
any
incompatibility
with
the
patent
law
to
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
it's
the
second
that
we're
arguing
about,
i
think.
i
think
it's
the
second,
when
you
have
to
show
that
it's
functional,
and
i
find
it
hard
to
think
that
it's
not
functional
when
you
have
a
patent
on
it.
you
only
give
patents
to
things
that
are
functional.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
law
requires
the
shape
of
the
sign.
i
mean,
in
many
states
that
shape
of
a
sign
indicates
a
certain
type
of
warning,
so
what's
left?
there's
nothing
left
but
the
legs,
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
your
friend
over
there
says
that
they
changed
the
legs.
they
did
change
the
legs.
justice
antonin
scalia
somebody
who
sees
their
legs
say,
gee,
it
has
the...
what
do
you
call
them...
step-down
legs,
or
whatever
it
is,
so
the
one
thing
it
seemed
to
me
that
they
could
have
changed,
they
did
change.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
gather
you
don't
care
about
the
motorists.
you
just
care
about
the
highway
purchasing
departments.
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
couldn't
care
less
about
the
motorists.
you
just
want
to
sell
the
signs.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
artz--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
hadn't
realized
it,
you
are
not
complaining
about
their
use
of
the
double
spring
feature.
that's
not
the
complaint.
you
said
they
could
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--used
the
double
springs
if
they
had
put
them
separate--
justice
antonin
scalia
--separately
and
apart.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
double
springs
next
to
each
other
was
not
part
of
your
original
patent
application--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
they
were
originally
apart.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
issue,
really,
is
simply
the
functionality
of
putting
the
springs
close
together.
now,
what
if
putting
the
springs
close
together...
it
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
patent,
but
what
if
putting
the
springs
close
together
makes
the
sign
more
stable?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
but
if
it
made
it
more
stable,
then
you
would
acknowledge
that
they
could
copy
even
that
feature,
the
unpatented
feature?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're
willing
to
fight
out
the...
i
gather
you're
willing
to
fight
out
the
functionality
battle
as
to
whether
putting
the
two
springs
right
next
to
each
other
instead
of
apart
is
a
functional
matter.
you're
willing...
are
you
willing
to
combat
on
that
ground?
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
it's
functional
within
the
meaning
of
the
trade
dress
restriction.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
but
you
would
agree
that
that
inquiry
would
be
addressed
to
the
spacing
of
the
springs.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
we
think
that
the
use
of
double
springs
is
automatically
no
basis
for
giving
you
trade
dress
protection,
since
you
had
patented
the
double
springs,
you
hadn't
patented
whether
they
were
close
together
or
far
apart
and
so
whether
putting
them
close
together,
as
your
opponent
did,
is
a
violation
of
trade
dress
protection
would
depend
upon
whether
putting
them
close
together
is
functional
within
the
meaning
of
trade
dress
law,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
seems
to
me
if
the
different
spacing
is
the
functional...
is
a
functional
equivalent
for
patent
law,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the
spacing
of
the
spring
is
part
of
your
patent
protection.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
well
as
the
nature
of
the
springs,
and
so
the
square
stand
is
no
different
for
purposes
of
the
issue
in
this
case
than
the
diamond-shaped
stand.
