well,
it
gives
you...
this...
i
think
my
question
is
related
to
justice
o'connor's,
and
this
is
a
problem
that
i
have
in
understanding,
and
maybe
you
can
help
me.
you
have
a
right
to
copy
the
invention.
does
it
follow
that
you
have
a
right
to
copy
the
configuration
that
that
invention
took
in
the
hands
of
the
patent
holder?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
agree
that
at
least
one
basis
on
which
we
could
decide
this
case
would
simply
be
on
the
basis
of
how
expensive
a
concept
of
configuration
trade
dress
we
want,
because
if
we
take
your
position,
configuration
trade
dress
is
going
to
be,
at
least
in
formally
patented
matters,
a
pretty
narrow
concept,
and
if
we're
going
to
have
coherence
within
the
concept
of
configuration
trade
dress,
we're
going
to
have
to
make
it
equally
narrow.
i
mean,
we
can't
have
different
functionality
tests,
i
presume,
and
if
on
the
other
hand
we
find
good
reason
to
think
configuration
trade
dress
is
desirable,
then
we're
going
to
go
the
other
way
with
a
different
concept
of
functionality,
i
suppose.
