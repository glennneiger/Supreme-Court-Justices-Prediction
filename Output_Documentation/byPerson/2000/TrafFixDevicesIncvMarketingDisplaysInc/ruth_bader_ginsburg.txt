in
any
event,
they're
different
in
this...
if
i'm
looking
at
the
right
diagrams
the...
your
client
has
a
different...
has
the
orange
color.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
roberts,
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
say,
at
least
as
i
understood
it
to
say,
okay,
the
dual
springs
traffix
could
have,
but
you
have
to
devise
some
kind
of
other
stand,
curved
legs,
or
a
double
stand.
i
thought
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
we
were
dealing,
mr.
roberts,
with
just
the
patent
law,
that
would
be
one
thing
and,
as
i
understand
it,
although
it's
confusing,
the
word
useful
is
a
patent
term
of
art
and
functionality
is
a
trade
dress
term
of
art,
but
you're
trying
now
to
equate
these
two
terms
in
answer
to
questions
that
you've
had
as
one
and
the
same,
but
they
have
different
purposes,
as
i
understand
it,
in
the
patent
law,
the
idea
of
useful,
trade
dress,
the
idea
of
functionality.
you
recite
the
old
cases
like
kellogg.
it's
been
argued
that
on
the
trade
dress
side
the
law
has
evolved
since
those
old
cases,
and
it's
now,
trade
dress
gets
more
protection.
justice
ruth
bader

wasn't
the
exact
same
sign...
i
thought
one
of
the
points
that
was
made
was
that
in
the
patent
infringement
case,
that
sign
didn't
look
as
much
like
the
market
display
signs--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace,
may
i
ask
if
you
would
answer
the
question
that
justice
stevens
posed
to
mr.
roberts
in
the
same
way?
that
is,
the
definition
you're
now
giving
us
as
functional
sounds
like
you
would
come
out
the
same
way
on
this
alleged
trade
dress
infringement,
even
if
there
had
never
been
any
patent
in
the
picture,
because
this
sign,
all
the
ingredients
are
functional.
there's
no
purple
bow
on
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
involves
size
and
shape,
and
this
discussion
about
qualitex
and
aesthetic
functionality
doesn't
get
into
what
effect
the
patents,
if
any,
has
on
functionality,
and
in
your
view
does
the
patent...
your
having
had
a
patent,
building
up
goodwill,
free,
over
20
years,
nobody
can
compete
with
that,
so
if
you've
got
secondary
meaning
it's
because
you
have
been
able
to
keep
everybody
off.
we've
been
dealing
with
cases
in
your
discussion
where
there
was
no
patent
in
the
picture.
how
should
the
fact
that
there
was
a
patent
bear
on
the
inquiry
that
was
made
in
cases
where
there
was
no
patent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
a
problem--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
we
apply
that
test,
because
i'm
having
a
little
trouble
connecting
to
the
real
world
and
the
device
before
us
and
these
multi-factor
tests
and
even
what
you've
just
been
saying.
tell
me
what
it
is
in
your
formerly
patented
device
that
traffix
can
copy
now
that
the
patent
has
expired.
can
it
make
a
sign
with
those
two
coil
springs
adjacent
to
each
other?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
could
describe
to
me
what
it
can
copy
and
what
it
must
change
i
would
have
a
more
secure
handle
on
what
your
case
is.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
aren't
that
many
things
to
adjust.
i
mean,
one
of
the
things
about
qualitex
and
the
green/gold
you
could
have
tan/silver,
any
number
of
combinations
that
would
serve
that
purpose,
but
for
that
road
sign
that's
not
going
to
blow
in
the
wind
you
have
to
have
those
springs,
and
you
have
to
have
some
kind
of
base,
and
there
aren't
that
many
variations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
that
one
in
your
right
hand
probably
works
better.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
and
that's
why
they
wanted
to
copy
it,
and
not
something
that
worked
less
well.
