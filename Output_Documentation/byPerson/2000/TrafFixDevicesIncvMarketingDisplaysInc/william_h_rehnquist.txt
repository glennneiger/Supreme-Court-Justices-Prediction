mr.
artz,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
evidence,
mr.
artz,
that
congress
affirmatively
approved
the
tenth
circuit
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i...
you...
i
thought
part
of
your
argument
was
that
the
tenth
circuit
had
decided
this
case
in
1995
and
it
was
quote,
before,
close
quote,
congress
at
the
time
it
made
the
amendments.
what
is
the
purport
of
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
not...
you're
arguing,
i
hope,
something
more
than
post
hoc
ergo
propter
hoc.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
is
the
base,
after
you
get
through
with
the
legs,
and
the
upright,
and
the
springs?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
could
you...
you
indicate,
what
are
we
arguing
about,
the
legs
and
the
base.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
when
you
say
base,
that
really
is
another
way
of
saying
the
legs?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
artz.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
