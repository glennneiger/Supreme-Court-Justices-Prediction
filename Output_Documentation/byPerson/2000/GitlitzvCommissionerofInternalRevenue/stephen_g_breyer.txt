justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what's
supposed
to
happen?
some
disaster
must
occur
in
the
tax
code
since
the
government
did
at
one
point
push
this
argument,
but
it
stopped,
i
want
to
know
what
disaster
occurs
if
you
just
take
108(d)(7)(a),
in
which
it
says
these
things
will
apply
at
the
corporate
level.
it
says
it
applies
at
the
corporate
level,
those
three
sub...
four
subsections,
(a),
(b),
(c)
and
(g);
(c)
and
(g)
are
just
special
cases,
but
(a)
and
(b)
is
the
main
case.
it
says
they
apply
at
the
corporate
level.
what
does
that
mean?
it
means
it
doesn't
flow
through.
it's
very
simple;
nothing
flows
through.
the
attributes
don't
flow
through.
nothing
flows
through.
all
right.
now
once
you
say
that,
that
cures
what
seems
an
anomaly
from
a
point
of
view
of
policy.
why
don't
we
interpret
it
that
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
let's
see
what
it
says.
it
says,
in
the
case
of
an
s
corporation,
subsections
(a),
(b),
(c)
and
(g)
shall
be
applied
at
the
corporate
level.
now
why
can
i
not
take
those
words
to
mean
they
shall
be
applied
at
the
corporate
level
and
only
the
corporate
level,
i.e.,
they
do
not
flow
through?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
they
say
nothing.
they
say
nothing.
so
what
i'm
doing
is
suggesting
that
because
they
say
nothing
one
way
or
the
other,
one
can
interpret
those
words
"shall
be
applied
at
the
corporate
level.
"
to
mean
everything
to
do
with
108
applies
at
the
corporate
level
in
the
case
of
the
subchapter
s
corporation,
and
does
not
flow
through.
so
what
i'm
asking
you
is
why
can
i
not
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
got
that
point.
your
point
is
the
language.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
anything
other
than
the
language?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
nothing
else.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why
do
you
say
it's
no
anomaly?
i
would
think
with
an
ordinary
corporation
the
chance
of
an
insolvent
corporation
ending
up
with
a
lot
of
positive
income
in
the
year
of
insolvency
is
pretty
low.
with
an
individual,
the
chance
of
an
individual
ending
up
with
a
lot
of
positive
income
in
the
year
of
insolvency
is
pretty
low.
in
the
case
of
an
s
corporation,
the
chance
that
a
shareholder
of
the
insolvent
s
corporation
could
have
a
lot
of
positive
income
in
that
year
is
pretty
high.
and
therefore,
if
we
accept
your
intention
for
an
s
corporation,
your
interpretation,
we
reach
as
a
practical
matter
quite
a
different
result
in
terms
of
tax
windfalls
than
you
do
in
the
other
two
instances.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
given
that
is
before
the
court,
what
was
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg.
i
was
having
exactly
the
same
problem.
i
accept
its
a
loophole,
for
argument's
sake.
if
it
was
a
terrible
loophole,
this
would
not
be
the
first
loophole
that
congress
wrote
and
it
won't
be
the
last.
and
maybe
it
would
be
the
last,
marvelous.
there
are
31
separate...
29
separate
subsections
of
this
statute
that
use
the
words
"gross
income
does
not
include".
and
i
take
it
in
respect
to
every
one
of
those
but
one,
you
will
say
they
are
items
of
income.
and
obviously
one
thing
i
would
be
reluctant
to
do
is
to
take
those
same
words
"gross
income
does
not
include",
and
say
that
those
are
items
of
income
in
every
instance
but
this
one.
or
in
every
instance
but
three.
or
create
a
new
spider
web
of
rules
as
to
when
the
words
"gross
income
does
not
include"
does
mean
it
is
none
the
less
items
of
income
but
doesn't
in
other.
that's
the
problem
i'm
facing.
and
to
say
"it's
congress's
clear
intent"
doesn't
help
me
solve
that
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
are
you
saying
it's
always
the
same,
those
words
29
subsections
whatever
they
are
referring
to
is
never
an
item
of
income
or
do
you
mean
sometimes
is
and
sometimes
isn't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
never?
what
for
example
about
a
lessor's
income?
there's
a
reference
here
to
a
payment
by
a
lessor
of
a
certain
kind
of
rent
which
i
thought
surely
would
increase
basis.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
you
answer
one
other
question
which
is,...
but
it's
going
to
sound
as
if
it's
on
your
side
so
be
tempted
to
agree
but
don't
agree
because
you
haven't
pushed
this
argument
and
i
want
to
know
why.
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
strongest
point
was
the
words
keeping
it
at
the
corporate
level.
because
if
you
kept
it
at
the
corporate
level
no
problem
i
can
think
of
would
be
caused
and
it
eliminate
the
loophole
and
seems
consistent
with
the
language,
but
you
have
not
pushed
that
argument.
and
therefore
there
must
be
some
disaster
in
tax
law
lurking.
