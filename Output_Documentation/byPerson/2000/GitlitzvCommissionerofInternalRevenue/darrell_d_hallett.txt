mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
as
a
result
of
the
position
taken
by
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
on
the
brief
before
this
court,
the
issue
the
court
needs
to
decide
is
a
limited
one.
and
that
issue
is
whether
the
amount
of
debt
discharge
or
cancellation
of
debt
of
an
insolvent
debtor
which
is
excluded
from
income
under
section
108
is
income,
such
that
it
amounts
to
an
item
of
income
which
increases
the
shareholder's
stock
basis
under
sections
1366
and
1367
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
commissioner
rests
his
entire
case
in
his
brief
on
the
argument
that
under
section
108
no
income
is
realized
by
the
insolvent
debtor.
your
honors,
that
position
is
clearly
contrary
to
the
statute.
and
if
i
may
rather
than
paraphrasing
initially,
read
the
statute,
i
think
it's
really
critical
to
this
issue
and
resolves
this
issue.
and
that
statute
is
section
108(a)(1)
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
at
page
34.
and
it
states
as
follows,
gross
income
does
not
include
any
amount
which,
but
for
this
subsection,
would
be
includable
in
gross
income
by
reason
of
the
discharge
of
indebtedness
of
the
taxpayer
if
the
discharge
occurs
when
the
taxpayer
is
insolvent.
to
paraphrase
that,
your
honors,
what
that
subsection
(a)
says
in
hopefully
plain
english
is
that
an
item
is
only
excluded
under
section
108
if
it
otherwise
would
have
been
included
in
gross
income
under
section
61.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
it
may
well
be
consistent
with
the
restructuring
of
the
internal
revenue
code
in
1954,
in
which
congress
said
very
broadly
in
section
61
that
gross
income
includes
all
income
from
whatever
source
derived,
and
listed
specific
items,
some
15
of
those,
and
one
of
them
is
income
from
subsection
12.
and
then
consistent
with
that
over
in
sections
101
through
138,
those
items
that
are
included
in
income
are
specifically
excluded
from
gross
income.
so--
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
--well,
first
of
all,
because
this
statute
clearly
says
that--
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
--there's
a
reason
for
it
is
that
in
the
final
analysis,
the
basis
reflects
the
shareholder's
equity
in
the
corporation,
roughly
speaking,
and
the
shareholder
gets
equity
in
the
corporation
by
contributing
capital.
he
also
gets
equity
in
the
corporation
when
income
is
realized,
taxable
or
nontaxable.
and
the
congress
recognized
that
if
losses
have
accumulated
such
that
they
are
not
deductible
because
they
exceed
the
basis,
well
when
income
is
realized,
nontaxable
income
such
as
municipal
bond
interest,
that
income
goes
down
to
increase
the
basis
to
reflect
the
fact
that
there
now
is
an
increased
equity
investment.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
i
think
what...
they
clearly
did
that
in
1984
when
the
congress
said
that
in
the
case
of
an
s
corporation,
the
amount
is
excluded
if
there's
insolvency
at
the
corporation
level.
they
certainly
recognized
that
by
doing
that,
the
benefit
of
the
exclusion
would
come
down
to
the
shareholder
who
could
well
be
solvent.
and
i
think
to
the
extent
the
legislative
history
reflects
why
they
did
that,
it
made
it
simpler
to
look
to
the
insolvency
of
the
corporation
rather
than
up
to
75
shareholders.
they
may
well
have
recognized
that
in
any
situation,
certainly
not
all,
if
the
s
corporation
is
in
trouble,
the
shareholder
is
in
trouble
as
well.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
well,
it
would
depend
on
whether
or
not
my
clients
the
shareholders
were
insolvent.
if
they
were
insolvent
then
they
would
be
entitled
to
the
result
that
we
are
seeking.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
this
particular
case,
if
the
law
would
have
remained
as
it
was
in
1982,
then
if
the
shareholder
were
solvent
he
would
not
be
able
to
exclude
the
amount
from
gross
income.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
it
was
a
change
in
1984.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
that
is
true.
we
would
look
to
the
change.
but
i
think
you
would
also
look
to
the
critical
statutes
that
existed
prior
to
the
change
in
1984
and
the
statutes
which
provide
for
the
basis
increase,
and
those
are
sections
1366
and
1367.
now
when
congress
made
the
change
in
1984,
they
did
not
change
those
provisions.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
well,
it's
not
the
case
that
it's
a
windfall.
it's
certainly
not
the
case
that
it's
a
windfall.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
well,
certainly
if
you
view
a
benefit
excluding
the
debt
discharge
amount
from
gross
income,
then
if
the
attribute
deduction
provisions
come
into
play,
you
could
view
that
as
a
recapture
of
the
benefit
in
the
future.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
that's
correct.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
that's
correct.
and
much
as
your
honor
stated,
the
increase
in
basis
by
the
amount
of
discharged
debt
occurs
at
the
time
of
the
insolvency
and
permits
the
taking
of
the
losses.
and
by
taking
of
the
losses,
the
losses
of
course
go
away.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
it's
not
always
a
windfall.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
that's
correct.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
well,
i
don't
think
so
because
it...
it
would
still
presuppose
that
the
item
is
income.
in
other
words--
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
--yes.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
yes.
if
congress
would
have
said
specifically
that
cod
is
not
income.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
exactly.
and
that's
a
very
important
distinction
that
was
drawn
when
section
108
was
enacted
in
1980.
i'd
also
point
out,
your
honor,
that
if
the
commissioner
were
correct,
that
cod
is
not
income,
then
section
108
would
never
apply
to
an
insolvent
debtor.
and
if
we
look
at
section
108(b),
it
only
comes
into
play
if
an
amount
is
excluded
under
section
108(a).
now
if
it's
not
income
and
it's
therefore,
doesn't
come
within
108(a)
because
it
otherwise
wouldn't
be
income,
then
the
attribute
reduction
process
which
the
commissioner
places
so
much
weight
upon
would
never
occur.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
because
the
statute
doesn't
say
that.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
because
we
have
to
look
at
what
is
applied
at
the
corporate
level.
for
example,
subsection
(a),
the
exclusion
from
gross
income
is
applied
at
the
corporate
level.
and
that's
logically
because
the
corporation
realizes
the
income
and
it
excludes
it.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
subsection
(b),
and
this
is
the
critical
part
of
the
statute,
an
essential
part
of
the
statute
as
amended
in
1984,
is
that
the
insolvency
is
determined
at
the
corporate
level.
but
those
two
provisions
do
not
say
anything
about
the
basis
pass
through.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
because
the
statute
doesn't
say
everything
occurs
at
the
corporate
level.
it
says
the
gross
income
is
excluded--
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
--yes.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
and
the
failure
to
say
anything
in
either
108
or
sections
1366
and
67
about
the
general
rule
of
basis...
pass
through
to
basis
not
occurring.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
there's
nothing
to
suggest
that.
not
a
hint.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
well,
i'm
not
sure
it
would
result
in
a
double
tax.
i
think
it
clearly
would
read
into
the
code
language
that's
simply
not
there.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
that's
true.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
that's
true.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
true.
once
we
go
through
the
process
of
determining
how
much
the
losses
exceeded
basis
for
the
taxable
year,
as
the
statute
tells
us
to
do,
if
the
losses
are
completely
absorbed
by
the
cod,
if
they
are
completely
absorbed
because
of
the
increase
in
basis,
then
assuming
there's
no
other
attribute,
assuming
there's
no
basis
in
assets
that
can
be
reduced,
that
would
be
true.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
no.
actually,
and
i
have
to
point
out,
this
is
not
in
the
record,
your
honor,
the
losses
were
totally
absorbed
but
there
was
some
800
thousand
dollar
basis
in
assets
and
properly
applied,
even
though
the
losses
were
absorbed,
the
cod
income
is
still
there
and
the
cod
income
would
be
applied
in
the
next
taxable
year
to
reduce
the
basis
in
the
assets.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
no,
no,
that's
true.
that's
correct.
and
i
would
just
point
out,
it's
a
very
important
concept
of
section
108
that,
i
think
it's...
you
read
the
legislative
history
and
it
does
admittedly
talk
about
a
purpose
is
to
pick
up
the
income
in
the
future
through
the
attribute
reduction,
but
congress
allowed
a
very
very
important
exception
to
that.
and
that's
the
full
ability
to
use
net
operating
loss
carryovers
or
basis
in
the
case
of
property
sold
in
the
year
of
discharge.
very
very
important,
such
that
certainly
many
taxpayers
are
going
to
have
excluded
cod
income
but
they
are
not
going
to
have
any
attributes
to
be
reduced.
i
don't
believe
the
situation
we
have
here
is
in
any
way
an
anomaly.
we
have
absolute
proof
of
that
in
one
of
the
cases.
the
pugh
case,
there
were
no
attributes
at
all.
there
were
no
suspended
losses,
there
was
no
basis
in
assets
to
reduce.
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
course
held
that
the
cod
passed
through.
so
we
know
that
situation.
we
know
that
situation
exists.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
well,
i
think
though
in
the
other
two
instances,
take
a
corporation
that's
in
trouble
and
has
net
operating
losses,
it
could
well
be
the
situation
that
it
doesn't
have
any
basis
in
its
assets
in
excess
of
the
liabilities.
it
excludes
the
amount
from
income
and
it
doesn't
have
any
attributes
to
reduce.
that's
what
i'm
saying;
it's
not
an
anomaly
to
have
a
situation
such
as
we
have
in
this
case
that
whether
it's
a
corporation,
a
regular
corporation
or
a
partnership,
that
we
don't
end
up
with
any
attributes
to
reduce,
particularly
because
they
can
be
used
in
the
taxable
year
of
the
discharge.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
yes.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
yes.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
well,
that
could
come
into
play
if
for
example,
if
the
taxpayer
here
had
800
thousand
of
basis
in
property,
not
the
taxpayer,
but
if
the
s
corporation
had
the
800
thousand
dollar
basis
in
property,
then
that
would
be
reduced.
that
would
be
reduced.
it
would
be
reduced
though
specifically,
section
1017
says
it
would
be
reduced
after
the
taxable
year
of
the
discharge,
as
of
the
beginning
of
that
year.
i
would
just
call
the
court's
attention
as
well
to
one
other
section
that
i
think
solidifies
that
income
is
realized
as
a
result
of
debt
discharge
and
that's
section
108(e)(1)
on
page
43.
and
it
specifically
says
there
is
no
other
insolvency
exception
to
the
general
rule
that
cod
is
income
to
be
included
in
gross
income.
and
that
general
rule
is
provided
in
section
61(a)(12).
and
finally
on
this
matter,
the
commissioner
goes
back
to
1923
and
cites
court
cases
particularly
in
the
depression
era,
and
a
treasury
regulation
that
was
promulgated
before
the
substantial
1980
revisions
of
section
108.
and
i
would
point
out
that
those
court
cases
are
flawed
reasoning.
the
notion
is
that--
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
--they
represent
flawed
reasoning.
the
rationale
in
those
cases
that
if
a
debtor
realizes
debt
discharge,
that
there
is
no
income
if
he's
insolvent.
of
course
the
court
held
in
1931
in
kirby
lumber
that
as
a
general
proposition
there
is
income.
and
these
cases
in
the
depression
era
picked
up
on
some
language
in
kirby
lumber
about
"the
forgiveness
of
the
debt
frees
up
assets.
"
and
they
said
well,
if
you're
insolvent,
it
doesn't
add
to
assets.
and
so
there
is
no
realization
of
income.
that
was
the
rationale
of
those
cases.
and
i
submit
that
just
defies
economic
reality
where
a
debtor
has
2
million
dollars
in
debt,
or
1
million
dollars
in
debt,
or
100,000
dollars
in
debt,
and
that
is
discharged.
and
if
he's
a
few
hundred
dollars
or
a
few
hundred
thousand
dollars
still
insolvent
after
the
discharge,
that's
a
real
economic
benefit.
he
can
take
the
amount
that
otherwise
would
be
paid
for
principal
and
interest
on
that
debt
and
apply
it
to
expenses
to
keep
going.
when
you
recognize
that
the
insolvency
is
determined
based
on
the
fair
market
value
of
the
assets,
it
could
well
have
a
situation
where
the
real
estate
operating
assets,
the
value
doesn't
exceed
the
debts.
but
when
a
million
dollars
of
debt
is
discharged,
that
money
is
indeed
freed
up.
it
does
indeed
free
up
the
liquid
assets
to
either
pay
down
other
debts
or
refinance
or
pay
expenses.
if
that
rationale
applied,
if
that
rationale
applied,
that
would
mean
where
a
debtor
is
insolvent
and
sells
an
asset
for
a
million
dollar
gain,
that...
but
is
still
insolvent,
and
say
he
takes
the
million
dollars
and
uses
it
to
pay
off
debt,
if
that
rationale
applied,
there
would
be
no
income
in
that
situation.
because
after
the
transaction,
even
though
he's
had
gain,
he's
still
insolvent.
that's
not
the
tax
law.
and
i
submit
that
that
transaction
cannot
be
meaningfully
distinguished
from
the
situation
where
the
debt
is
directly
discharged.
let
me
turn
briefly
to
the
specific
language
of
sections
1366
and
1367.
and
i
think
there's
a
question
of
where
do
you
start
here.
do
you
start
with
section
108
or
do
you
start
with
sections
1366
and
67?
i
don't
think
it
makes
a
difference.
because
if
you
start
with
section
108,
you
go
to
108(d)(7)(b).
and
that
sends
you
over
to
sections
1366
and
sections
1367.
sends
you
over
to
determine
the
amount
of
the
losses
that
are
disallowed
for
the
taxable
year
of
the
discharge
before
you
can
determine
that
there
is
an
attribute.
and
those,
i
would
just
point
out
that
1366
and
67
are
very,
very
broad.
this
isn't
a
narrowly
drawn
statute.
it
says
in
1366
that
all
items
of
income,
including
tax
exempt
income,
are
taken
into
account
in
determining
shareholder
basis.
congress
described
the
reason
for
the
basis
increase
in
some
of
the
legislative
history
as
insuring
that
if
an
item
is
nontaxable,
then
if
there's
later
a
distribution,
the
shareholder
doesn't
have
to
recognize
income
as
a
result
of
the...
it
preserves
its
nontaxability.
the
commissioner
seizes
upon
this
stated
purpose
of
a
shareholder
basis
increase
and
argues
that,
well,
that
means
that
you
only
could
increase
basis
for
a
nontaxable
item
if
you
get
cash,
money
in
the
till
that
you
can
distribute
in
kind.
well,
the
statutes
don't
require
that
there
be
a
distribution
in
kind.
the
statutes
don't
say
that
you
have
to
lock
the
cash
up
in
a
safe
deposit
box
and
use
it
in
the
future
for
a
distribution.
the
fact
is
if
you
have
municipal
bond
interest
that's
collected
and
used
to
pay
debt
you
are
in
the
same
situation
on
the
bottom
line
balance
sheet
situation
of
the
shareholder
and
the
corporation.
but
the
critical
event
here,
and
this
is...
i'm
glad
the
commissioner
brought
up
this
notion
of
realization
of
income,
because
commentators
and
some
of
the
courts
have
said
that,
well,
you
shouldn't
give
the
shareholder
the
losses
because
he
hasn't
had
an
economic
loss.
well,
the
point
is,
he's
had
an
economic
gain.
it's
the
economic
gain,
the
income,
that
congress
has
chosen
not
to
tax,
that
permits
the
taking
of
the
losses.
i
would
finally
point
out
under
section
108
that...
excuse
me;
before
i
get
to
that
i
would
point
out
that
what
we
are
asking
for
is
consistent
treatment
here.
an
s
corporation
that
gets
excludable
municipal
bond
interest
is
entitled
to
up
the
basis
and
take
losses.
and
we
ask
for
the
same
thing.
the...
all
other
debtors
who
exclude
cod
income
get
to
use
their
attributes
in
the
year
of
discharge
and
we
ask
for
the
same
thing.
and
this
108(d)(7)(b)
has
really
been
a
matter
of
confusion.
it
hasn't
been
read
closely.
it
requires
that
before
you
eliminate
any
losses
you
have
to
go
over
to
sections
1366
and
67
and
determine
if
there
is
an
excess
of
losses
remaining
after
the
cod
income
is
taken
into
account.
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
darrell
d.
hallett
with
respect
to
victor
and
eustice
treatise,
what
it
actually
says
is
that
cod
income
of
an
insolvent
debtor
is
not
gross
income.
and
it's
cited
in
the
brief.
not
one
of
the
authorities
cited
by
the
government
say
that
it
is
not
realized.
they
say
it's
excluded
from
gross
income.
with
respect
to...
if
the
commissioner
were
right
that
because
an
item
is
excluded
from
gross
income,
then
none
of
the
items
excluded
from
gross
income,
life
insurance
proceeds,
interest
on
municipal
bonds,
none
of
those
would
increase
basis
because
they
are
not
income
and
could
not
be
an
item
of
income.
this
double
tax
benefit.
there
is
no
tax
benefit
at
all
without
a
basis
increase.
the
item
just
as
well
have
been
taxable.
if
it
was
taxable,
the
income
would
flow
down
to
the
shareholder.
his
basis
would
go
up
and
he'd
be
able
to
his
loss
against
the
income.
he'd
end
up
with
zero
basis
and
zero
income
just
the
same
position
where
the
commissioner
urges
he
should
end
up
here.
finally
the
tenth
circuit
did
not
develop
the
timing
rule
on
its
own.
that
rule
is
word
for
word
what
was
urged
upon
it
by
the
justice
department
in
that
case.
this
case
has
been
a
constant
moving
target.
the
only
time
the
commissioner
argued
the
no
realization
was
the
first
time
this
case
was
decided
before
then
chief
judge
cohen
in
tax
court.
she
rejected
it.
it
was
never
raised
again
until
it
was
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
brief.
i
submit,
your
honor,
a
plea
on
behalf
of
tax
practitioners
in
this
country.
they
should
be
able
to
read
the
code
as
written.
they
shouldn't
have
to
speculate
as
to
whether
or
not
a
result
that
is
called
for
on
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
is
too
good
to
be
true
or
is
a
wind
fall.
the
tax
laws
are
too
complicated
to
have
to
get
into
that
kind
of
speculation.
thank
you.
