you
know,
it
seems
a
little
contradictory
to
say
that
under
section
108,
the
taxpayers
here
have
to
pay
some
sort
of
tax
whether
you
call
it
a
deferred
tax
or
just
a
price
on
something
that
you
say
isn't
income
of
any
type.
it
just
seems
contradictory.
and
i'm
concerned,
if
we
say
it's
not
income,
that
there
may
be
other
items
that
are
currently
considered
to
fall
within
section
61
as
income
that
all
of
a
sudden
we
find
aren't.
and
i
don't
know
how
far
that
would
take
us
if
we--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
except
that
section
61
of
title
26
says
that
income
includes
income
from
discharge
of
indebtedness.
i
mean
that's
a
germinal
provision.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
that
is
the
normal
rule.
