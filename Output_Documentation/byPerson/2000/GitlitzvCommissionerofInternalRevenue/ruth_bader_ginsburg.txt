justice

bader

mr.
hallett,
it
seems
that
the
subchapter
s
shareholder
is
the
only
solvent
entity
who
could
take
advantage
of
this.
the
peculiar
thing
about
this
provision
is
that
every
other
taxpayer,
say
a
subchapter
c
corporation,
a
partner
in
a
partnership,
the
insolvent
would
have
to
be
that
entity,
that
tax
paying
entity.
but
here
you
have
the
peculiarity
that
the
subchapter
s
corporation,
which
is
not
itself
a
taxpayer,
is
the
insolvent,
while
the
shareholders
are
highly
solvent.
and
is
there
any
reason
why
congress
would
want
to
give
those
solvent
taxpayers
this
advantageous
treatment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
wasn't
that
way
up
until...
and
yet,
in
1982...
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
do
you
recognize
that
if
the
1982
law
was
still
in
place,
the
government
should
win?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
in
this
case
where
we
have
very
solvent
shareholders
and
an
insolvent
subchapter
s
corporation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
was
the
change
in
'84?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
we
would
look
to
a
reason
for
that
change
if
we
are
trying
to
understand,
as
justice
kennedy
asked,
whether
there
might
be
something
other
than
the
words
of
the
statute
going
for
the
position
you
are
taking?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hallett,
may
i
go
back
to
an
earlier
colloquy,
and
that
is,
as
i
understand
it
in
this
case,
the
tax
attributes,
at
least
under
your
theory,
they
wouldn't...
that
would
be
an
academic
question
because
the
losses
here
were
entirely
wiped
out
against
the
increased
basis.
isn't
that
right?
there
were
no
losses
left.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
take
that
to
be
the
case
here,
that
the
losses
were
totally
absorbed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not...
we
don't
have
the
next
tax
return
before
us,
so
we
don't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jones,
would
you
clarify
whether
you
are
indeed
walking
away
from
the
rationale
of
the
tenth
circuit
which
was
not
about
the
characterization
of
this
as
income,
but
was
a
timing
question,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
did
argue
the
theory
that
the
tenth
circuit
accepted;
you
argued
it
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
jones,
isn't
that
antithetical
to
the...
is
it
in
1017
the
general
timing
rule
that
you
take
this
in
the
next
year,
not
in
the
year
of
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
you
think
that
the
timing
rule
is
changed
here,
it's
surprising
that
you
didn't
make
any
suggestion
of
that
in
your
brief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let
me
see
if
i
can
get
you
to
focus
precisely
on
the
point
i'm
trying
to
understand.
you
have
just
told
us
that
in
the
tenth
circuit
brief
we
will
not
have
found
this
unusual
approach
to
the
timing
question.
we
would
not
have
found
that
in
the
government's
argument.
we
certainly
don't
find
it
in
our
brief
in
this
court.
i'm
just
trying
to
determine
whether
the
government
at
least
considered
it
an
alternate
argument
in
the
lower
courts
and
for
some
reason
abandoned
it
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
i
look
at
the
government's
brief,
i'll
find
that
corroborated?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
we
go
back
to
the
formulation
that
gross
income
does
not
include?
well,
that
same
formulation
is
also
used
for
tax
exempt
bond
interest.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
words
of
the
statute
are
the
same.
gross
income
does
not
include.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
forgiveness
of
indebtedness--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
do
you
think
congress
did
then
in
'84?
i
take
it
that
taxpayer
is
conceding
that
if
the
82
law
remained
in
place
a
subchapter
s
shareholder
would
be
just
like
a
partner
in
partnership
and
could
not
get
this
benefit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
a
change
in
108,
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
what
you
were
essentially
arguing
is
that
we
should
undo
the
change
that
congress
made
in
108.
and
you
are
telling
me,
no,
the
change
in
108
didn't
do
anything?
or
what?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
they
applied
at
the
shareholder
level
then
you
have
a
solvent
shareholder.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
but
what
was
the
effect
of
saying
take
it
at
the
corporate
level
so
that
the
insolvent
is
the
corporation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
didn't
somebody
point
out
to
congress
or
didn't
congress
know
that
a
subchapter
s
corporation
is
quite
different
from
a
subchapter
c
corporation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
just
me
the
rationale
was
that
all
corporations
should
be
treated
alike.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
congress
was
explicit
there
in
a
way
it
isn't
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't
congress
say
that
there
won't
be
any
increase
in
basis?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
here
we
don't
have
anything
that
says
it
won't
be
an
increase
in
basis.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
will
concede
that
to
say
basis
will
not
be
increased
is
something
a
lot
clearer
than
what
you
are
presenting
to
us?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
why
didn't
they
make
that
same
statement
with
respect
to
this,
knowing
that
the
courts
were
all
over
the
lot?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the
year
of
the
real
estate
provision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
93.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
i
am
asking
about
when
they
made
that
change
in
93
and
they
said
basis
will
not
be
increased.
why
didn't
they
just
say,
well,
let's
do
the
same
thing
for
subchapter
s
corporations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i'm
just
simply
asking
you
why
didn't
they
make
that
same
change
to
say
explicitly
basis
will
not
be
increased,
since
that
would
have
cured--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes,
but
couldn't
they
have
said
"now
we
are
adding
this
provision.
"
"and
we
are
making
this
thing
explicit.
"
"to
make
the
statute
compatible
we
ought
to
make
that
same
provision
elsewhere.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
are
certain
words
that
are
used.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
and
why
wasn't
it
made
clear
then?
basis
is
not
increased,
with
respect
to
this
subchapter
s?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
we
are
not.
we
have
a
provision
that
says
those
words
expressly.
you
are
asking
them--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought
it
was
in
the
statute
itself.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
its
not
in
the
statute
itself
in
any
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
a
provision
of
the
internal
revenue
code
that
says
basis
will
not
be
increased
that
was
a
change
that
was
made
in
the
statute,
not
legislative
history?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
perhaps
i
will
look
for
it.
it's
that
real
estate...
i
am
sure
that
you
must
be
familiar
with
it
and
i
thought
that
in
that
statute
itself
those
words
appeared.
