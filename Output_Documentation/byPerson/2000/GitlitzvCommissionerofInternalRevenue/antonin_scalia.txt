mr.
hallett,
is
it
invariably
the
case
that
this
comes
as
a
windfall
to
the
solvent
shareholder?
would
the
government
never
recapture
the
benefit
that
the
shareholder
gets?
justice
antonin
scalia
accept
my
characterization
of
it
as
a
windfall.
would
any
events
in
the
future
enable
that
benefit
to
the
shareholder
to
be
recaptured
by
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
suppose
the
corporation
suddenly
becomes
solvent,
its
business
picks
up
or
in
some
new
sort
of
business.
i
assume
that
at
that
point
the
distortion
would
even
out
for
years,
say
one,
two,
three,
four
and
five,
because
the
net
operating
losses
which
might
otherwise
have
been
deducted
against
the
new
income
are
now
diminished
by
reason
of
the
discharge
of
indebtedness
income.
justice
antonin
scalia
going
back
to
your
very
initial
point
about
section
108,
if
section
108
had
read,
"items
of
income
shall
not
include.
"
instead
of
"gross
income
does
not
include",
then
the
government
would
be
right;
is
that
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i'm
saying
if
it
specifically
said
income
from
discharge
of
a
debt
shall
not
be
treated
as
an
item
of
income.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
the
difference
between
excluding
from
gross
income
and
specifically
stating
that
it's
not
an
item
of
income,
as
the
case
turns
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
--excuse
me.
that
means
it
won't
be
treated
as
income
to
the
shareholder.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
not
talking
about
whether
in
the
abstract
it's
an
item
of
income.
they
have
to
say
that
it's
not
treated
as
an
item
of
income
because
otherwise
it
normally
would
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
to
put
it
more
simply,
if
my
bank
told
me,
you
know,
forget
about
your
mortgage.
boy,
i'd
feel
a
lot
richer.
you
are
telling
me
that
that
is
not
an
accretion
of
wealth?
that's
unbelievable.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
it's
income
when
it
hurts
the
taxpayer
in
later
years?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
also
says
it
does
not
include
income
from
a
lot
of
other
things.
i
mean,
as
justice
breyer
was
pointing
out
earlier,
there
are
a
lot
of
other
things
as
to
which
it
says
the
same
thing.
and
all
it
means
is
that
although
gross
income
would
normally
mean
this,
for
purposes
of
subchapter
s,
it
will
not
mean
that.
but
that
does
not
mean...
it
is
in
the
abstract,
not
income.
i
thought
the
argument
you
are
making
here--
justice
antonin
scalia
in
fact,
no
court
of
appeals
has
agreed
with
the
government
on
this
point,
has
it?
is
there
any
court
of
appeals
that
has
agreed
with
this
argument?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
answer
is
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
the
insolvent
corporation...
i'm
sorry.
what's
the
presumption
you
refer
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
it
not
end
up
being
a
double
tax
in
the
other
direction?
let's
assume
an
insolvent
chapter
s
corporation
that
later
recovers.
all
right.
the
taxpayer
would
never
have
gotten
the
increase
of
his
basis
that
arises
from
this
reduction
of
indebtedness
and
therefore
could
not
offset
against
any
future
gain
that
he
gets
from
the
corporation.
is
that
fair?
