mr.

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--they
are
what,
mr.
hallett?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hallett.
mr.
jones,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now
mr.
jones,
we've
got
some
20
pages
in
the
appendix
of
statutory
sections.
when
you
cite
a
statutory
section,
could
you
refer
us
to
the
page
of
the
appendix
on
which
it
is?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--was
this
some
article
in
a
law
review
you
are
talking
about.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
a
treatise?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
has
the
court
of
appeals
come
out
on
this
issue?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
meant
just
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
or
appeals
ruled
for
the
government
on
this
issue.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
other
court
of
appeals
ruled
against
the
government
on
this
point?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
didn't
the
government
argue
this
in
the
other
courts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
you
now
disagree
with?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
can't
be
controlling.
there's
no
reason
to
simply
distort
the
tax
code
to
avoid
a
wind
fall
in
this
particular
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
than
you,
mr.
jones.
mr.
hallett,
you

two
plus
minutes.
