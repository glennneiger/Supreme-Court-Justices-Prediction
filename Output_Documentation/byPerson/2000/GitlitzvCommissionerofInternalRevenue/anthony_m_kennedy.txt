justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
your
argument
under
the
statute
is
a
strong
one.
but
is
there
any
reason
in
tax
theory
or
practical
equity
why
congress
would
want
to
allow
this
result
in
this
particular
case?
i
mean,
i
understand
that
the
statute
may
compel
this,
but
is
there
some
underlying
rationale
to
support
your
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
i
am
asking
is
why
would
congress
allow
you
to
use
income
that
you
don't
pay
tax
on,
to
increase
the
basis
and
then
which
would
allow
you
to
deduct
additional
unrelated
losses?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know
that's
position
number
one.
i'm
asking,
is
there
a
reason
for
this?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
there,
to
answer
justice
scalia's
question,
there
might
be,
i
think
there
might
be
some
instances
in
which
this
distortion,
if
we
can
call
it
that,
or
windfall,
does
even
itself
out?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it
isn't
always
a
windfall
or
distortion,
accepting
those
characterizations?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
it
an
answer
to
justice
breyer,
and
i
may
be
wrong
about
this,
that
if
that
interpretation
prevailed,
there
would
be
some
instances
in
which
the
shareholder
was
really
entitled
to
a
double
tax.
in
other
words,
if
there
were
basis
left
and
the
basis
were
not
decreased
as
a
result
of
this
interpretation,
then
the
shareholder
in
effect
would
be
paying
a
double
tax
in
some
instances,
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
the
shareholder
would
be
taxed
in
effect
for
discharge
of
indebtedness
income
even
though
the
corporation
was
insolvent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
the
basis
would
not
be
reduced.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
to
put
justice
ginsburg's
question
another
way,
if
you
do
not
prevail
on
your
argument
that
it's
not
income,
i
take
it
you
don't
ask
us
to
accept
a
backup
position
that
reflects
the
view
of
the
circuit
on
timing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
we
don't
think
it's
a
problem.
let's
assume
that
we
simply
reject
that
argument.
i
want
to
know
if
the
backup
argument,
if
you
think
that
as
a
matter
of
sound,
statutory
construction,
i
think
this
is
what
justice
ginsburg
was
asking,
for
us
to
accept
the
timing
rule
adopted
by
the
circuit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
1336
or
66?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
you
address
the
issue
you
are
now
addressing
in
the
tenth
circuit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
you
address
the
issue
you're
presenting
to
us
in
the
tenth
circuit
other
than--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
footnote
14
of
your
brief.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
for
whatever
reason,
this
argument
that
you
now
say
is
so
obvious
on
the
face
of
the
code,
was
this
referred
to
in
your
argument
to
the
tenth
circuit
other
than
in
a
footnote,
footnote
14
of
your
brief?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
didn't
dig
this
out
myself.
it
was
stated
in
your
opponent's
presentation.
is
it
inaccurate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
does
not
constitute
income.
you
made
that
explicit
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
past
cases
in
which
the
irs
has
argued
that
something
is
not
income,
or
is
this
a
first?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
that
was
addressed
by
your
adversary.
he
said
well,
suppose
you
have
a
corporation
which
is
insolvent
by
a
million
dollars,
and
part
of
that
is
a
950,000
dollar
indebtedness.
there's
a
world
of
difference.
it
amazes
me
that
the
government
says
this
isn't
income.
