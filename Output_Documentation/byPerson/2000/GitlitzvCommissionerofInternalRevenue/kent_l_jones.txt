mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
congress
did
not
provide
to
subchapter
s
shareholders
the
unique
double
tax
benefit
that
petitioners
seek.
the
simple
question
presented
here
is
whether
the
discharge
of
debt
of
an
insolvent
is
an
item
of
income
or
tax
exempt
income
that
flows
through
to
shareholders
and
increases
their
basis
under
1366.
the
plain
text
of
the
directly
applicable
statutes
seems
to
provide
a
pretty
clear
answer
to
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
timing
question,
we
don't
think
the
timing
question
ever
arises
in
this
case,
nor
has
it
ever
properly
arisen
in
any
of
the
other
cases.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
actually,
i
believe
the
tenth
circuit
developed
that
theory
on
its
own.
i
believe
that
in
the
tenth
circuit
as
in
the
other
cases
our
argument
has
been
twofold,
that
this
item
has
never
been
regarded
in
the
80-year
history
of
the
internal
revenue
code
as
income
for
an
insolvent
taxpayer.
secondly,
that
108(d)(7)
recognizes
and
is
an
emanation
of
that
fact.
the
tax
court
rationale
was
that
108(d)(7)
says
all
of
this
happens
at
the
corporate
level.
and
it
isn't
income
because
it's
excluded
and
it's
not
tax
exempt
income
so
nothing
passes
through.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
the
court
were
to
disagree
with
our
basic
contentions,
then
you
would
be
faced
with
a
problem...
then
as
a
court
the
problem
would
be
that
you
have
the
clear
history
of
the
statute
that
says
this
is
not
to
be
treated
as
income.
it's
to
be
applied
against
tax
attributes
and
then
to
be
disregarded.
so
you
would
have
that
clear
history.
you
would
also
have
the
presumptive
rule
that
tax
statutes
should
not
be
interpreted
to
provide
a
double
benefit.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
is
an
appropriate
resolution
of
the
problem
if
you
reach
it,
and
the
reason
that
is
so,
is
that
1336(d)(2)
requires
the
losses,
the
suspended
losses
from
the
prior
year,
to
be
brought
into
the
corporation
in
the
year
of
the
discharge.
and
then--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--1366(d)(2).
mr.
kent
l.
jones
on
page
53
of
the
petition
appendix.
it
says,
any
loss
or
deduction
which
is
disallowed
for
a
taxable
year
by
reason
of
the
prior
paragraph
of
that
same
page,
shall
be
treated
as
incurred
by
the
corporation
in
the
succeeding
taxable
year.
now
this
is
the
point
that
the
tenth
circuit
made,
that
this
provision
brings
back
into
the
year
of
the
discharge
the
losses
from
the
prior
year,
the
suspended
losses
from
the
prior
year.
and
then--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
is
a
different
treatment
of
suspended
losses.
it
is
expressly
a
different
treatment
of
suspended
losses
and
how
they
are
handled
on
the
subchapter
s
return.
these
are
rules
peculiar
to
subchapter
s's.
yes.
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes.
it
is
a
different
treatment
for
suspended
losses.
it
brings
them
into
the
year
of
the
discharge.
and
then
under
108
we
know
that
the
tax
attribute
reduction
is
to
apply
at
the
corporate
level.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
think
that
it's...
i
wouldn't
call
it
a
fall
back
argument
but
i
would
call
it
not
a
correct
way
to
analyze
the
basic
problem
that
we
have
in
this
case,
which
is
that
the
courts
have
glossed
over
the
question
of
whether
this
has
ever
been
regarded
as
an
item
of
income,
and
in
particular
whether
congress
intended
it
to
be
treated
as
such,
when
the
history
of
the
statute
says
as
clearly
as
it
could
that
congress
accepted
the
80
year
old
position
of
the
treasury
and
the
judicial
insolvency
exception,
did
not
regard
this
as
an
item
of
income,
said
that
it
was
to
be
applied
to
reduce
tax
attributes
and
then
in
the
words
of
both
the
house
and
senate
reports,
has
no
further
tax
consequences.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
it...
i
wouldn't
quite
put
it
that
way.
i
think
that
the
right
way
to
put
it
is
the
way
i
have
put
it,
which
is
that
with
proper...
we
are
presenting
this
case
to
you
with
complete
integrity.
we
think
this
issue
need
not
be
reached
in
this
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
actually,
i
believe
in
the
tenth
circuit
we
didn't
address
the
issue.
i
believe
the
tenth
circuit
developed
its
analysis
on
its
own.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'm
sorry,
justice?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
although
in
the
tenth
circuit,
we
were
defending
the
tax
court's
ruling.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
you
are
expressing
a
close
familiarity
with
that
and
i
don't
remember
footnote
14.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
is...
i
have
recently
looked
at
our
brief
in
the
tenth
circuit
and
my
recollection
of
our
brief
in
the
tenth
circuit
was
that
we
made
the
same
point
and
we
made
the
same
argument
in
the
context
that
the
tax
court
resolved
the
issue,
which
is
that
first
they
talked
about
how
it's
all
done
at
the
corporate
level.
and
then
having
reached
that
conclusion,
emphasized
that
there
is
no
item
of
income
and
no
tax
exempt
income
in
connection
with
this
item.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
in
fact,
we
noted
that
the
treasury
regulations
have
provided
this
for
70
years,
long
before
61
was
enacted,
long
before
108,
and
that
the
courts
had
adopted
the
judicial
insolvency
exception,
had
agreed
with
the
commissioner
that
no
income
arises
from
the
discharge
of
the
debt
of
the
insolvent.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
it's
an
uncomfortable
position
for
us.
i
mean,
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
resolve
this
case
properly
without
addressing
that
subject.
but
we
can't
because
congress
made
that
the
fulcrum
of
its
legislative
determination.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't
know
of
any
other.
and
of
course
i
don't
know
if
that
provides
you
with
any
comfort,
but
let
me
answer
the
first
part
of
the
question
you
raised
which
is,
are
there
other
situations
where
something
that
does
not
constitute
income
has
an
effect
on
basis,
or
doesn't.
the
closest
example,
and
i
don't
believe
it's
quoted
in
the
appendix,
is
1368(b).
and
1368(b)
is
a
provision
that
says
that
if
a
subchapter
s
corporation
has
no
earnings
and
profits
and
makes
a
distribution
to
its
shareholder,
that
won't
be
treated
as
income
and
under
1367
it
will
reduce
their
basis.
well,
this
is
a
similar
determination.
if
something
has
happened
here
that
puts
the
shareholders
in
a
position
whether
they
might--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
actually,
if
you
look
at
the
close
words
of
the
statute,
it
doesn't
say
that.
section
61
begins
with
the
phrase
"except
as
otherwise
provided,
discharge
of
a
debt
is
an...
is
income,
section
108
says,
discharge
of
a
debt
of
an
insolvent
is
not
an
item
of
income.
"
and
that
recognizes
the
historical
distinction
that
justice...
that
this
court
had
talked
about
in
commissioner
versus
tufts,
in
justice
blackmun's
opinion
that
the
whole
theory
of
the
discharge
of
indebtedness
doctrine
is
that
the
discharge
frees
up
the
assets
of
the
debtors
and
he
could
use
them
to--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
not
as
an
item
of
income
though.
they
come
in
as
tax
exempt
income.
1366
raises
the
basis
for
items
of
income
including
tax
exempt
income.
tax
exempt
income
is
something
that
really
is
income,
and
it's
an
accretion
to
wealth.
the
only
example
that--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--right.
but
tax
exempt
income
is
real
income.
it's
something
that
you
receive.
it's
an
asset.
it
is
an
accretion
to
wealth
within
the
concept
of--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--is
not.
forgiveness
of
indebtedness
for
an
insolvent,
as
justice
blackmun
pointed
out
in
footnote
11
of
commissioner
versus
tufts,
doesn't
free
up
any
assets.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
my
responsibility
to
this
court
is
to
tell
you
how
congress,
what
we
understand
congress
used
these
terms
to
mean.
congress
could
not
have
been
more
clear.
they
adopted
a
judicial
insolvency
exception
that
adopted
a
longstanding
regulatory
interpretation.
it
doesn't
matter,
this
court
doesn't
have
to
resolve
the
broader
question
of
whether
under
commissioner
versus
glenshaw
glass
this
might
be
thought
to
be
an
accretion
of
wealth.
you
don't
have
to
resolve
this
question
because
what
is
before
the
court
is
how
did
congress
view
that
difference.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
but
it
should
help
you
resolve
that
problem
because
what's
at
issue
was
what
was
congress's
intent
when
it
used
the
phrase
"items
of
income".
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
i'm
focused
on
your
problem.
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question
is
probably
that
in
all
of
those
instances
it
wouldn't
be
an
item
of
income.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
wouldn't
be
income
received
in
the
year.
and
what
happens
is
you
are
supposed
to
reduce
the
basis
and
recognize
as
this
court
said
in
centennial
bank,
recognize
that
deferred
income
in
future
years.
and
as
that's
recognized
then
it
becomes
an
item
of
income
in
that
sense.
but
in
the
first
year
it's
not
treated
as
an
item
of
income
for
this
purpose.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's
income...
if
it's
income
then
it
increases
the
basis.
and
if
its
not
income,
it
doesn't.
and
if
its
not
income
and
doesn't
increase
the
basis
then
it's...
then
any
income
effect
would
be
recognized
in
subsequent
periods.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
we
do.
we
put
it
as
our
second
point.
we
don't
abandon
that
argument.
it's
definitely
addressed
in
our
brief.
its
sort
of
an
intellectual
fussiness
that
causes
us
to
address
the
income
issue
first
and
then
the
shareholder
issue,
i
mean
the
corporate
level
issue.
and
that
is
because
(d)(7)
wasn't
enacted,
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out
until
1984.
but
in
1980
congress
already
went
ahead
and
said
this
is
not
to
be
treated
as
an
item
of
income;
it's
to
be
used
to
reduce
attributes
and
it
is
to
have
no
further
tax
consequences.
so
we
shouldn't
have
to
look
to
1984
legislation
in
(d)(7)
to
answer
this
question.
now
(d)(7)
is
consistent
with
our
answer
and
therefore
and
it
is
a
sufficient
answer.
but
it
seems
to
me
to
be
perfectly
faithful
to
what
congress
said
they
did
and
to
what
the
text
of
the
these
statutes
permit
us
to
understand.
we
don't
have
to
go
to
84.
we
can
go
right
to
where
congress
said.
and
i
want
to
point
out
in
this
respect
that
it
is
solely
on
the
1980
legislation
that
professors
victor
and
lokin
reviewed
the
history,
reviewed
the
provisions
and
agreed
with
us
that
the
discharge
of
indebtedness
of
an
insolvent
party
does
not
represent
an
item
of
income
and
is
to
be
ignored
after
it's
applied
against
the
tax
attributes.
now
what
petitioners'
is,
let's
not
ignore
it,
let's
get
a
tax
benefit
from
it.
we'll
pass
it
through
as
if
it
were
income.
we
will
get
a
basis
adjustment
that
allows
us
to
deduct
the
standard
losses.
and
what
they
have
done
is
used
108
to
enhance
their
tax
attributes
when
section
108(b)
makes
it
clear
that
the
whole
point
of
108(b)
is
to
reduce
tax
attributes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well
that--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
didn't
change
the
basic
principles
of
108
that
the
amendment
in
1984
simply
said
that
the
tax
attribute
reduction
would
be
applied
at
the
corporate
level
for
subchapter
s
corporations.
this
is
in
108(d)(7)(a).
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
they
applied
it
at
the
shareholder
level
for
solvent
shareholders
they
would
recognize
the
income
and
pay
it
on
their
own
returns.
it
wouldn't
have
any
consequence.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
congress
said
that
they
were
doing
that
because
they
wanted
all
shareholders
to
be
treated
the
same.
that
was
the
explanation
that
congress
gave.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
this
is
a
special
rule
actually
that
applies
only
for
subchapter
s's.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
no,
no,
i'm
sorry,
that
all
shareholders
of
this
subchapter
s
corporation
should
be
treated
the
same.
in
other
words
they
didn't
want
to...
congress
said
they
didn't
want
to
have
shareholder
one
to
be
treated
differently
from
shareholder
two
although
as
you
are
aware
for
partnerships
that
kind
of
different
treatment
can
result.
but
congress
didn't
think
this
had
anything
to
do
with...
that
the
change
in
108(d)(7)
had
anything
to
do
with
the
issue
here
because
they
had
already
resolved
the
issue
in
1980
when
they
explained
how
these
statutes
were
to
work.
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
in
1993
when
congress
amended
section
108
to
extend
its
application
to
qualified
real
property
indebtedness,
congress
went
through
the
operation
of
these
same
provisions
and
said
the
same
thing.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't
know
how
congress
could
have
been
more
explicit
in
1980--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that's
true
that
was
explicit
in
'93.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
we
have
awfully
good
indication
of
that.
we
have
congress
saying
it's
not
income.
it's
only
to
be
used
to
reduce
tax
attributes.
it
has
no
other
tax
consequences,
and
is
then
to
be
disregarded.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
it's
perfectly
clear.
but
to
me
it's--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--in
1980
the
courts
were
not
all
over
the
lot.
in
1980
no
court
had
ever
suggested
that
the
discharge
of
the
debt
of
an
insolvent
was
income.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
93.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
am
sorry.
they
were
talking
about
subchapter
s
corporations
in
1993.
they
were
talking
about
exactly
the
issue
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
statute
wasn't
amended
in
any
of
its
substantive
characters
in
93.
they
just
added
another
provision
to
the
same
statute--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--they
were
talking
about,...
when
they
said
basis
is
not
adjusted,
they
were
talking
about
the
subchapter
s
corporation
provisions
involved
in
this
case.
so
they
were
talking
about
previously
enacted
provisions
of
section
108
in
describing
how
they
applied.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
basis
is
not
increased
by--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that
is
exactly
what
they
said
at
that
the
time
in
'93.
i'm
sorry.
we
are
not
communicating.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's
not
a
provision.
it's
just
legislative
history.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
i
am
sorry.
now
i
understand.
it
was
in
the
history
of--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
was
in
the
history
of
the
93
amendment
that
congress
in
going
through
how
the
statute
operates,
explained
that
for
subchapter
s
corporations
this
is
not
an
item
of
income;
it
doesn't
adjust
basis.
that
is
all
i
am
saying.
i
am
not
saying
that
this
is
binding
history,
i'm
just
saying
it
is.
mr.
kent

i
am
not
familiar
with
that,
but
it
is
just
the
contrary.
the
statute
says
only
that
basis
will
be
adjusted
if
there's
an
item
of
income.
an
congress
said
this
isn't
and
item
of
income.
i
know
that
that's--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
am
not
familiar
with
that.
the
contention
that
if
it
is
not
an
item
of
income
then
its
tax
exempt
income
is
also
fundamentally
flawed
for
the
same
reason.
its
not
tax
exempt
income
because
its
not
an
accretion
to
wealth.
its
not
income
in
the
first
place,
tax
exempt
income.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
says
"except
as
otherwise
provided
#"--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--income
includes
income
from
discharge--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
that's
the
contingent
rule.
it
says
except
as
otherwise
provided,
income
includes
income
from
discharge.
108
says
it
does
not
include
income
from
discharge
of
an
insolvent.
and
that
is
the
80
year
history
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't
have
any
objection
to
what
you
just
said.
i
think
it
is
perfection
correct.
i
think
it's
a
proper
concern.
but
our
point
is
that
what
you
are
supposed
to,
what
we
have
to
resolve
here
is
what
did
congress
mean
when
it
said
items
of
income
in
1366
because
that's
what
flows
through.
congress
said
this
is
not
an
item
of
income.
and
i
say
this,
i
mean
the
discharge
of
the
debt
of
an
insolvent.
my
only
point
about
the
congruence
of
61
and
108
is
that
they
cannot
win
on
those
provision
because
all
those
provision
say
is
what
we
say,
it's
not
income.
and
what
the
legislative
history
of
the
provisions
say
is
exactly...
is
why
we
are
here
today,
which
is
that
congress
has
always
said
this
isn't
income.
has
never
permitted
it
to
have
any
tax
consequences
other
than
attribute
reduction.
and
i
go
back
again
to
victor
and
loken.
i
mean,
they
are
a
pretty
objective
neutral
source
on
this,
and
they
agree
with
us,
that
this
is
not
the
way
congress
used
the
term
and
that
after
it
is
used
to
reduce
attributes,
it's
to
be
ignored.
the
reason.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's
actually
in
their
treatise.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
federal
income
taxation.
it
is
a
pretty
reliable
guide.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
court
of
appeals
have
been
sort
of
all
over
the
map.
if
you
are
talking
about
the
court
in
this
case,--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
the
third
circuit
in
the
farley
case
ruled
against
the
united
states,
saying
that
the
plain
language
of
108
makes
this
an
item
of
income.
and
i
don't
understand
their
reasoning
because
the
plain
language
of
108
says
it
is
not
an
item
of
income.
and
the
clear
history
of
the
statute
says
it
should
never
be
treated
as
one.
and
instead
it
is
to
be
ignored
after
you
reduce
basis.
i
mean
after
you
reduce
the
tax
attributes,
so.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't
think
there
is
a
court
of
appeals
that
has
gone
through
these
arguments
that
we
have
made
the
primary
focus
of
our
position
in
this
court.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
they
haven't
addressed
them,
justice
scalia.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
again,
i
believe
what
we
were
doing
is
that
we
were
forwarding
the
rationale...
we
were
defending
the
rationale
of
the
tax
court.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
as
i
explained
to
justice
breyer,
we
think
that
the
proper
way
to
reach
this,
to
analyze
this
is
the
way
congress
did,
to
start
with
108
in
1980.
and
then
to
point
out
that
the
amendment
to
(d)(7)
in
1984
was
consistent
with
that
result
and
promoted
that
conclusion.
now,
what
the
tax
court
did
was
different.
they
said,
as
justice
breyer
points
out
that
all
of
this
should
be
done
at
the
corporate
level
and
nothing
escapes
to
the
shareholders
because
it's
all
handled
at
the
corporate
level.
i
think
that's
a
correct
conclusion.
but
i
think
one
of
the
reasons
it's
a
correct
conclusion
is
because
there
is
no
item
of
income
that
can
escape
to
the
shareholders
and
add
to
their
basis
and
give
them
this
double
tax
benefit
wind
fall.
and
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
in
each
of
these
cases
when
a
basis
adjustment
is
allowed
there
is
indeed
a
windfall
there.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't
its
controlling
but
it
is
a
presumption
that
congress
doesn't
intend
to
do
that.
and
so
when
you
look
at
these
statutes
and
you
have
the
clear
history,
and
if
you
have
any
uncertainty
about
the
application
of
the
plain
text
of
those
provisions,
that
uncertainty
should
be
resolved
to
avoid
creating...
either
denying
the
intention
of
congress
or
creating
the
windfall
benefits.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
presumption
is
what
this
court
said
in
skelly
oil,
that
tax
statutes
should
not
be
interpreted
to
be
provide
the
practical
equivalent
of
a
double
deduction,
which
is
exactly
what
they
have
sought.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
that
what
you
are
pointing
out
is
exactly
the
opposite
of
how
congress
looked
this
situation.
what
congress
said
was
they
are
getting
this
immediate
benefit
not
having
this
treated
as
income
in
the
year
that
the
debt
is
discharged.
and
recognize
that
they
might
benefit
from
that
in
future
periods
if
they
have
income
from
other
sources,
congress
said
i
want
to
reduce
the
tax
attributes,
the
favorable
tax
attributes,
like
suspended
losses--
