justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
the
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
of
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
petitioners
are
shareholders
in
an
insolvent
subchapter
s
corporation
that
excluded
discharge
of
indebtedness
from
its
gross
income.
petitioners
pass
through
this
their
pro
rata
shares
of
the
discharge
of
indebtedness
as
income
to
their
individual
tax
returns.
accordingly,
increased
their
basis
in
corporate
stock
and
deducted
their
losses.
the
commissioner
denied
the
deductions
and
the
tax
court
affirmed
that
denial.
the
court
of
appeals
affirm
the
tax
court
holding
that
before
petitioners
could
pass
through
the
discharge
of
indebtedness
income
to
increase
their
basis,
they
had
to
reduce
the
s
corporation’s
tax
attributes
by
the
amount
of
discharge
of
indebtedness.
by
doing
that
it
would
have
absorbed
all
of
the
losses
at
the
corporate
level
and
there
would
have
been
nothing
to
pass
through
to
the
taxpayers.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse.
section
61(a)(12)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
states
that
discharge
of
indebtedness
is
generally
included
in
gross
income.
section
108
merely
permits
insolvent
s
corporations
to
exclude
discharge
of
indebtedness
from
gross
income,
and
section
108(e)(1)
specifically
presumes
that
discharge
of
indebtedness
remains
an
item
of
income.
discharge
of
indebtedness
income
of
an
insolvent
s
corporation
is
therefore
subject
to
pass
through
as
an
item
of
income
to
shareholders.
section
108(b)(4)(a)
directs
that
tax
attribute
deductions
shall
be
made
after
the
determination
of
the
tax
imposed
for
the
taxable
year
of
the
discharge.
to
compute
the
tax
imposed
the
shareholders
must
pass
through
the
s
corporation’s
items
of
income,
increase
their
basis
in
corporate
stock
and
take
deductions.
therefore
the
pass
through
must
occur
before
the
s
corporation’s
tax
attributes
are
reduced.
in
that
way
it
is
not
absorbed
at
the
corporate
level
and
remains
available
to
the
taxpayer.
in
this
case
petitioners
did
pass
through
the
s
corporation’s
discharge
of
indebtedness
income,
increased
their
basis,
and
take
their
deductions
without
having
already
reduced
the
s
corporation’s
tax
attributes.
they
therefore
were
entitled
to
the
claim
deductions.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
