mr.
jan
w.
baran
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
statute
before
you
makes
it
a
crime
for
a
political
party
to
send
one
letter
to
every
voter
in
the
state
if
the
candidate
requested
that
letter
or
collaborated
in
its
preparation.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
this
clear,
direct,
and
substantial
infringement
on
political
parties'
first
amendment
rights
is
justified,
and
based
on
this
court's
precedent,
the
legislative
record,
and
the
factual
record
developed
in
this
lengthy
case,
the
answer
must
be
no.
the
record
demonstrates
that
this
limit
directly
and
substantially
suppresses
political
party
speech
and
does
not
prevent
any
discernible
form
of
corruption.
moreover,
this
particular
federal
limit
stands
in
contrast
to
the
majority
of
state
laws
which
may
restrict
contributions
to
political
parties,
and
contributions
to
candidates
do
not
restrict
the
amount
of
party
support
that
can
be
received
by
candidates
themselves
with
state
elections.
the
money
that
the
party
can
spend
for
the
prohibition--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--according
to
the
amicus
brief
of
the
attorneys
general,
there
are
17
current
states
that
have
such
a
restriction
of
some
form.
there
used
to
be
20
states.
three
have
repealed
these
restrictions,
most
recently
colorado
last
year
and
also
our
largest
state,
the
state
of
california
in
november
of
2000
had
a
referendum
and
over
60
percent
of
the
voters
of
california
supported
that
proposition,
which
was
number
34,
and
that
proposition
placed
numerous
restrictions
on
contributions
to
candidates,
contributions
to
political
parties,
but
at
the
same
time
repealed
a
short-lived
restriction
that
the
state
of
california
had
on
the
amount
of
contributions
or
expenditures
that
parties
could
make
in
support
of
candidates
for
office
in
the
state
of
california.
the
money
that
the
parties
can
use
to
support
their
candidates
for
the
house
and
the
senate
and
even
for
president
has
to
be
the
so-called
hard
money.
the
district
court
noted
in
its
opinion
that
the
majority
of
this
so-called
hard
money
that
the
national
parties
raise
comes
in
sums
of
less
than
$100.
it
is
true
that
there
are
contribution
limits
that
are
somewhat
higher
for
parties
and
for
candidates.
for
my
client,
the
colorado
republican
party,
that
limit
is
$5,000
per
year.
and
for
national
party
committees
the
limit
on
individuals
is
a
maximum
of
$20,000
a
year.
i
believe
the
record
shows
that
there
are
very
few
$20,000
contributions--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--yes,
justice
breyer,
that
is
my
understanding
of
their
argument.
i
would
point
out
that
everything
you
just
described,
assuming
it
was
lawful
and
did
not
violate
the
antiearmarking
provisions
of
the
current
statute,
would
be
permissible
under
the
current
system
with
these
limits,
with
these
spending
limits.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
i
stand
by
my
earlier
answer,
justice
breyer,
that
that
is
possible
under
the
existing
system,
that
a
candidate,
taking
your
hypothetical,
could
say
i
don't
want
to
raise
contributions
from
a
thousand
people.
i
will
simply
go
and
collect
the
contributions
you
just
described
from
a
large
family
and
direct
it
towards
the
party.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
yes,
there
is
a
limit.
but
they
can
do
it
within
these
spending
limits.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
within
the
spending
limits.
and
if
this
practice
is
actually
plausible,
which
i
don't
believe
it
is,
surely
there
would
be
a
single
instance
of
this
type
of
contribution
practice
that
would
have
occurred
in
the
last
25
years
under
these
limits
including
in
states
with
very
sizable
spending
limitations
on
parties.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
and
there
is
none.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
that
is
correct.
contributors
do
contribute
to
the
party
who
have
also
contributed
to
candidates.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
i
disagree,
justice
souter.
the
hypothetical
that
has
been
advanced
here
is
that
there
is
an
incentive
for
candidates
to
go
to
individual
contributors
and
urge
them
to
donate
money
through
the
party
without
violating
the
anti-earmarking
provisions
in
large
sums
of
$5,000
or
$20,000
in
justice
breyer's
hypothetical.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
there
is
no--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--i
believe
it's
implausible
because
there
is
not
a
single
instance
of
that
having
happened
in
the
25
years
of
the--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--no,
your
honor,
i
believe
we
have
no
examples
because
after
15
years
of
litigation
in
this
case,
including
five-and-a-half
years
of
discovery,
including
depositions
of
numerous
party
officials
and
elected
officials,
there's
not
a
single
instance
of
any
contributor,
any
contributor
giving
any
amount
of
money
that
is
designated
for
a
specific
candidate.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
i
think
the
newspapers
also
reflect
that
there
are
people
who
are
pleading
guilty
and
actually
going
to
jail--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--for
making
earmarked
or
straw
contributions.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
the
record
in
this
case,
justice
breyer,
does
not
have
an
instance
of
that
type
of
circumstance.
it
does
support
the
proposition
that
when
candidates
are
involved
in
helping
their
parties
raise
money,
which
they
are
involved
in,
they
do
so
without
such
designations,
without
such
promises
that
the
money
will
be
spent
for
them,
and
the
record
is
very
consistent
that
the
political
parties
maintain
control
over
whether
to
spend
that
money,
how
to
spend
it,
and
on
whose
behalf.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
okay.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
i
believe
that
is
true.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
i
do
think
that
is
an
assumption
of
a
fact
that
i
believe
the
record
does
not
support.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
yes,
that
they
are--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--well,
the
record
reflects
that
many
candidates,
primarily
incumbent
office
holders,
are
very
active
in
raising
money
for
their
parties.
the
record
also
shows
that
political
parties
are
the
only
source
of
financial
support
in
our
system
that
do
not
primarily
support
incumbents.
in
fact,
this
past
election
we
have
experienced
the
phenomenon
that
more
money
is
being
donated
to
political
parties
from
excess
funds
of
incumbents
who
face
virtually
no
competition
in
their
reelection
efforts
than
the
amount
of
money
that
is
actually
being
spent
by
political
parties
to
support
other
incumbents
who
are
in
danger
of
losing
reelection.
so
we
have
a
possibility
here
that
the
people
that
candidates
should
really
be
indebted
to
are
incumbents
who
are
relinquishing
large
sums
of
their
own
money
to
help
their
party
elect
challengers
and
open-seat
candidates
to
join
incumbents
in
the
house
or
the
senate.
and
that
is
what
this
record
shows.
this
record
also
shows
that
the
money,
the
hard
money
that's
being
spent
is
being
spent
on
party
speech.
over
90
percent
of
the
money
that's
subject
to
these
spending
limits
is
for
direct
mail
and
television
and
radio.
now,
that's
as
of
1997.
i
believe
that
percentage
has
increased
since
we
took
all
of
those
facts
back
in
1997.
the
record
also
shows
that
the
political
parties
like
to
control
how
they
are
going
to
spend
their
money.
they
don't
like
to
just
give
a
pot
of
money
over
to
the
candidates.
the
record
shows
in
the
testimony
of
donald
dane,
colorado
republican
chairman,
that
we
don't
want
to
do
that.
we
don't
know
how
our
money
is
going
to
be
spent.
we
have
so
much
difficulty
raising
this
money,
why
would
we
want
to
do
that.
we
want
to
decide
how
it's
going
to
be
spent,
for
what
purpose
and
whether
or
not
this
was
a
good
use
of
our
limited
resources,
and
that
is
actually
what
the
practical
effect
is
of
striking
down
this
spending
limit
is,
i
think
there
is
a
misconception--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--i
think
it
is
significant
in
the
following
two
respects,
justice
o'connor.
number
one,
it
takes
away
from
the
government
and
places
back
to
the
political
parties
the
discretion
as
to
how
best
to
use
these
limited
resources
in
the
form
of
hard
money.
it
doesn't
do
a
party
any
good
to
have
a
right
to
spend
$3
million
under
this
limit
in
california
if
there
isn't
a
competitive
race
there
for
the
senate
and
at
the
same
time,
there
might
be
an
extremely
competitive
race
in
the
state
of
colorado
where
the
limit
is
200
or
$300,000,
depending
on
the
formula,
so
the
party
has
whatever
money
has
been
voluntarily
contributed
to
it
under
all
of
those
other
restrictions.
it's
hard
money.
they
decide
well,
we
want
to
spend
perhaps
$500,000
in
colorado,
or
we
want
to
spend
a
greater
amount
of
money
in
california
if
we
did
have
a
competitive
race.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
well,
the
record
that
we
developed
after
this
court's
consideration
in
1996
deals
with
the
exercise
of
political
parties
of
making
independent
expenditures
in
the
'96
election,
and
what
they
experienced
were
occasions
where,
by
spending
their
money
without
consultation
with
their
own
candidates,
they
made
some
mistakes,
political
mistakes.
they
contradicted
their
candidates.
they
may
have
mischaracterized
their
position,
and
the
result
is,
that
in
order
for
them
to
exercise
their
full
first
amendment
rights
by
spending
their
money
independently
and
ripping
themselves
away
from
their
indispensable
candidates,
they
actually
run
the
risk
of
harming
the
candidates
who
are
so
important
to
their
own
electoral
success.
now,
with
respect
to
any
other
independent
expenditure,
of
course,
the
jurisprudence
here
says
that
that's
a
risk
that
any
individual
or
political
committee
runs
by--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--well,
there
is
a
fundamental,
a
fundamental
question
of
what
is
the
right
of
a
political
party
in
terms
of
placing
conditions
on
how
they
are
going
to
spend
their
money
or
support
candidates.
there
is
no
reason
why
a
party
could
not
say
we
will
only
financially
support
candidates
who
agree
with
our
party
platform
to
cut
taxes.
and
if
they
decide
not
to
support
a
candidate
who
doesn't
adhere
to
that
platform
plank,
then
presumably
that
is
their
right
to
do
so.
it's
not
corrupt.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
the
practical
effect
of
striking
down
these
limits
in
addition
to
giving
parties
their
discretion
as
to
how
best
to
spend
their
limited
resources
is
that
i
believe
the
other
practical
effect
is
that
it
will
provide
an
incentive
for
political
parties
to
raise
more
hard
money,
which
is
presumably
the
beneficial
money
that
we
have
in
our
process.
right
now,
there
is
actually
a
perverse
effect
of
these
limits,
rather
than
preventing
corruption,
arguably,
they
are
promoting
corruption
because
the
limits
tell
a
party
chairman
or
fund-raiser
it
really
doesn't
matter
how
much
hard
money
you
raise.
you
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
spend
more
than
this
amount
to
promote
your
candidates.
so
a
party
leader
says,
well,
why
should
i
devote
my
limited
resources
and
time
and
energy
on
raising
more
hard
money
that
i
cannot
spend,
as
opposed
to
going
out
and
raising
more
of
the
soft
money,
which
cannot
be
spent
for
perhaps
the
same
purposes,
and
can't
be
as
politically
effective,
but
i'm
going
to
raise
more
soft
money
and
the
statistics
that
are
in
the
record
show
that
soft
money
has
increased
at
triple
digit
rates
from
'92
to
'96,
'96
to
2000,
and
yet
hard
money
fund-raising
has
essentially
plateaued.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
no.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
from
anybody.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
in
lieu
of
what?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
because
it
requires
me
to
try
and
read
the
minds
of
many,
many
politicians.
i
believe
that
there
would
be
a
division
of
opinion.
on
the
one
hand,
there
would
be
politicians
who
would
say,
yes,
i
would
like
to
scrap
this
system
and
be
able
to
take
unlimited
amounts
of
money
from
individuals
or
political
committees
and
i'm
prepared
to
hold
myself
accountable
to
the
public
and
the
voters
for
that
decision.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
there
would
be
politicians
and
incumbents
who
say,
no,
i
really
don't
want
that
because
i
think
it
would
present
a
political
problem
or
it
may
open
the
doors
to
some
undue
influence
and
pressures
from
large--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--no.
i
believe
that
there
is
a
very
substantive
and
historical
difference.
one
of
the
distinguishing
features
of
the
legislative
record
going
back
to
congress'
consideration
of
campaign
finance
reform
in
the
early
1970s
is
that
while
there
is
a
great
deal
of
concern
expressed
regarding
individuals
and
political
committees
supporting
candidates
of
political
parties,
the
utterances
from
congress
regarding
political
parties
are
uniformly
laudatory.
i
mean,
they
say,
well,
this
is
important
institutions,
they're
unique.
we've
got
to
give
them
lots
of
room
to
operate.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
but
i
believe
congress
has
perceived
that
to
be
a
benefit,
not
only
to
them,
but
to
the
entire
democratic
process.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
well,
there
is
a
very
interesting
reason
for
that,
which
goes
back
to
when
congress
devised
the
campaign
finance
system
that
this
court
reviewed
in
the
buckley
decision.
and
the
genesis
of
this
particular
limit
was
introduced
in
the
united
states
senate
back
in
1973
or
1974
at
a
time
they
were
considering
a
bill
which
provided
for
no
private
contributions
in
general
elections
for
the
senate
or
the
house
and
that
there
was
going
to
be
completely
publicly-financed
and
when
they
got
to
this
public
financing
proposition,
somebody
got
up
and
said,
well,
what
about
the
parties?
i
mean,
we
have
got
to
let
them
operate
and
they
said,
well,
that's
great,
we're
going
to
let
them
operate,
but
of
course,
our
principal
concern
in
addition
to
corruption
is
we
want
to
equalize
resources
and
we
want
to
make
sure
that
there
is
not
excessive
spending
so
we're
going
to
devise
this
formula,
which
is
more
generous
than
we
are
providing
to
anyone.
in
fact,
it's
generous
exponentially
because
we're
telling
individuals
and
political
committees
they
cannot
contribute
to
these
candidates
at
all,
and
that's
the
genesis
of
this
limitation.
we
discussed
that
in
1996
before
this
court
that
shows
that
historically
this
was
a
limit
imposed
to
prevent
excessive
spending.
this
court
noted
it
in
the
decision
of
fec
vs.
democratic
senatorial
campaign
committee
and
the
plurality
decision
noted
that
congressional
purpose.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
well--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--i
believe
that
if
that
were
the
policy
surely
one
senator
or
one
congressman,
at
some
point,
in
the
consideration
of
campaign
finance
over
a
period
of
literally
decades
would
have
gotten
up
and
said
you
know
what--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--surely
one
senator
or
one
congressman
at
some
point
in
the
consideration
of
campaign
finance
over
a
period
of
literally
decades
would
have
gotten
up
and
said,
you
know
what--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--no.
they
did
it
to
limit
spending.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
no.
because,
and
this
may
explain
a
little
bit
of
that
dichotomy
in
the
statute
today
that
we
have
that
contribution
limit
of
$5,000
to
candidates
from
a
political
party
and
yet
we
have
this
special
provision
in
section
441a(d).
well,
back
when
they
introduced
this
original
statute,
there
weren't
going
to
be
any
contributions
by
anybody
to
candidates
for
the
senate
and
the
house
in
general
elections.
mr.

i
believe
that
the
rationale
for
this
provision
today
is
the
original
rationale,
the
entire
statute,
this
provision
was
transferred
verbatim
after
this
court's
decision
in
buckley
from
the
criminal
code
of
title
18
into
the
existing
statutory
provision
of
title
2.
and
other
than
the
report
language
that
was
noted
in
the
government's
brief
regarding
the
effect
of
this
provision
after
buckley,
there
is
no
other
congressional
utterance
that
i'm
aware
of
regarding
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
this
really
is
a
relic
from
congress'
effort
to
basically
control
spending
in
the
entire
political
process.
there
is
one
final
point
i
would
like
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention.
there
has
been
discussion
about
congress'
treatment
of
family
members
and
there
is
an
intimation
that
perhaps
there
was
no
record
or
legislative
record
regarding
congress'
actions
in
that
regard.
we
noted
in
our
reply
brief
in
1996
that
there
is
legislative
record
of
concern
back
in
1974
about
wealthy
family
individuals
contributing
to
candidates
of
their
family.
there
was
even
the
example
noted
of
concern
that
nelson
rockefeller's
mother
had
contributed
one
and
a
half
million
dollars
to
his
campaign
in
1968,
and
there
are
some
floor
statements
by
legislators
as
well.
so
it
is
not
accurate
to
say
that
congress
did
not
have
any
expression
of
concern
about
family
members,
as
opposed
to
political
parties,
and
that
record
was
presented
to
this
court
in
buckley
when
it
considered
all
of
those
statutes
at
that
time.
i
would
also
like
to
address
the
question
about
what
is
the
definition
of
coordination.
that
is
in
the
statute,
section
441a.
it
does
prohibit
or
it
does
turn
an
expenditure
into
a
contribution
if
there
has
been
a
request
or
a
suggestion,
if
there
has
been
consultation
with
the
candidate
and
i
don't
believe
it's
at
all
clear
whether
the
government
would
not
restrict
a
political
party's
spending
if
they
simply
went
to
a
candidate
as
suggested
by
justice
scalia
and
said,
well,
will
this
help
you
or
will
this
hurt
you?
there
is
some
history
of
fec
enforcement
that
suggests
that
at
least
as
far
as
the
commission
is
concerned
that
would
constitute
coordination
and
therefore
would
be
either
subject
to
our
limit
or
somehow
barred
under
the
contribution
limits.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
have
covered
everything
i
intended
to
cover.
