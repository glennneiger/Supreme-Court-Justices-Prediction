ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
thank
you.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
twenty-five
years
ago
in
buckley
this
court
held
that
limits
on
campaign
contributions
can
be
more
easily
justified
under
the
first
amendment
than
limits
on
campaign
expenditures,
and
noted
that
a
coordinated
expenditure,
such
as
one
made
at
the
candidate's
request,
is
treated
as
a
contribution
for
this
purpose.
nothing
in
the
first
amendment
requires
an
exemption
from
these
rules
for
political
parties.
congress
recognized
that
parties
are
different
from
other
political
actors
and
gave
them
somewhat
higher
contribution
limits
and
much
higher
limits
on
coordinated
expenditures.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
political
parties
present
the
risk...
a
risk
of
the
corruption
that
justifies
limits
on
contributions
and
coordinated
expenditures
in
two
ways.
first,
because
they
can
receive
contributions
in
much
larger
amounts
than
other
actors
and
then
redistribute
them
to
candidates,
they
provide
a
conduit
for
other
actors
to
circumvent
the
contribution
limits
of
the
act.
other
donors
can
make
large
contributions
to
the
party
which,
though
not
technically,
literally
earmarked,
and
therefore
not
in
violation
of
the
specific
earmarking
provision
of
the
statute,
nevertheless
through
informal
and
well
understood
arrangements
find
their
way
through
the
party
to
the
candidate
and
create
the
same
risk
or
appearance
of
corruption
as
a
direct
contribution
to
the
candidate.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
congress
has
prohibited
earmarking,
but
the
court
recognized
in
buckley
itself
that
a
prohibition
on
earmarking
cannot
reach,
cannot
be
effective
to
reach
the
whole
problem
of,
in
effect,
using
an
intermediary
to
exceed
the
limits,
and
the
reason
is
for
one
thing
an
earmarking
arrangement
requires
something
more
rigid
than
what
would
usually
happen.
i
mean,
it's
not
earmarking,
for
example,
if...
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
if
a
contributor
understands
that
there
is
a
good
likelihood
that
the
money
will
be
passed
by
the
party
to
the
candidate,
although
there
might
be
reasons
why
it
would
not.
in
that
case
it's
not
earmarking,
but
it
still
has
the
prospect
of
being
regarded
by
the
candidate
and
by
the
donor
as
virtually
a
contribution.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
the
distinction
between--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
the
court
in
buckley
had
to
balance
a
number
of
different
concerns
in
arriving
at
its
distinction
between
independent
expenditures,
which
will
certainly
often
please
the
candidate,
but
which
it
regarded
as
sufficiently
important
in
first
amendment
terms
so
that
limiting
them
to
protect
against
possible
indirect
corruption
was
not
permissible
on
the
one
hand,
and
contributions,
direct
contributions
to
the
candidate,
which
the
court
saw
as
having
a
lesser
first
amendment
component
on...
importance
on
one
side--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--and
a
greater
potential
for
corruption
on
the
other.
that
distinction
having
been
made,
coordinated
expenditures
are
the
functional
equivalent
of
contributions.
when
you
pay
somebody's
bills,
it's
no
different
from
handing
them
a
check,
and
that's
what
we
have
here.
now,
the
additional
point
that
i
was
addressing
was
the
use
of
an
intermediary
to
make
the,
that
is,
if
we,
if
we
have
a
prohibition
on
contributions
and
coordinated...
not
a
prohibition,
a
limitation
on
contributions
and
coordinated
expenditures
to
protect
against
corruption,
then
it
can
be
easily
circumvented
through
intermediaries,
and
there
are
only
a
few
ways
to
solve
the
intermediary
problem.
one
of
them
is
to
limit
contributions
to
the
intermediary,
in
this
case
the
party.
another
is
to
limit
contributions
by
the
intermediary
to
the
candidate.
that
would
be
from
the
party
to
the
candidate.
and
the
third
is
to
try
to
prevent
earmarking
directly.
each
has
its
pros
and
cons,
and
the
statute
uses
each
of
them
to
some
degree
to
complement
the
other.
this
court
recognized
in
buckley
that
it's
impossible
to
police
earmarking
sufficiently
because
of
informal
and
nonrigid
arrangements.
the
approach
of
limiting
contributions
to
the
party
so
that
it
can't
operate
as
a
pass-through,
would
starve
the
party
of
needed
funds.
it
has
disadvantages
of
that
sort.
there
is
a
limitation,
but
it's
a
high
limitation.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
the
section--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
no.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no,
the
party
can
do
it
in
unlimited
amounts
when
it
is
making
the
same
kind
of
independent
expenditure
that
the
court
held
was
entirely
protected
in
buckley
and
in--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
right.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
right.
this
is
a
small
segment
of
the
problem.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
it
is
a
segment--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
the
evidence
that
there
is
a
risk
of
intermediaries,
parties
in
particular,
but
intermediaries
in
general,
aiding
donors
to
circumvent
statutory
limits
is
found
in
several
places.
first
of
all,
in
the
senate
debate
in
1973,
and
we
discuss
this
at
pages
28
and
29
of
our
brief,
several
senators
made...
expressly
observed
that
a
party
can
act
as
a
conduit
for
an
individual
who
has
reached
his
contribution
limit.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
correct.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
right.
that
the
anti-earmarking
provision
itself
is
evidence
of
congress'
concern
about
that,
about
the
evasion
of
the
limits
on
donors.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
there
are
remarks
by
members
of
congress.
there
is,
better
perhaps
even
than
anything
congressional...
anything
that
was
said,
the
fact
that
congress
enacted
an
anti-earmarking
provision
which
shows
that
it
was
concerned
about
the
danger
that
donor
a
would
avoid
his...
the
limit
that
he
could
contribute
to
candidate
c
by
passing
it
through
b.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
correct.
and
this
court
said
it
wasn't
sufficient
in
buckley,
and
observed
that
that's
part
of
why...
part
of
what
justifies
the
limit
on
individual
contributions
in
a
campaign,
the
total
limit,
not--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--yes.
there
are
two
arguments
about
the
risk
of
corruption.
at
the
moment
the
argument
that
i'm
talking
bout
is
that
the
party
is
a
means...
that
the
contribution
limits
on
individual
donors
are
justified
as
a
means
of
preventing
corruption
and
the
risk
of
corruption
donor
to
candidate,
and
that
the
party,
as
an
intermediary,
can
facilitate,
can
essentially
undermine
that
mechanism
that
the
individuals
can
exceed
their
contribution
limits.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
i
would
say...
i
wouldn't
call
it
a
prophylactic
rule.
i
would
call
it
an
amplification
or
a
support
or
a
backup
to
the
anti-earmarking
provision.
it's
addressed
at
the
same
problem
that
the
earmarking
provision
is
addressed
at.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
but
it
covered--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
no
more
thing
that
the
contribution--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--than
the
direct
contribution
limit.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--yes,
it
is
not
the
case...
i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
i
don't
think
it
disables
it.
i
would
agree
that
it...
that
the
function
of
the
party
is
in
large
part
to
elect
candidates,
and
that
a
limitation...
i
guess
any
limitation
on
it...
but
i...
if
it
were
prohibited
from
making
any
contributions
to
candidates
and
if
it
were
prohibited
from
making
independent
expenditures,
it
couldn't
accomplish
its
purposes.
there
is
no
limit
on
its
independent
expenditures.
there
is
no
limit
on
a
large
variety
of
party
building
and
get-out-the-vote
and
message-communicating
activities,
and
there
is
a
not...
there
is
a
not...
there
is
a
limit,
the
limit
on
contributions
to
candidates,
and
the
limit
on
coordinated
expenditures
which
are
a
form
of
contributions
is
not
disabling.
it's
quite
a
bit
higher
than
the
limit
on
any
other
contributor,
recognizing
the
role
of
the
party,
but
just
attempting
to
put
a
ceiling
on
it.
it's
a
limit
that's
adjusted.
it's
basically--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--coordinated
expenditures
have--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--coordinated
expenditure
has
a
technical
meaning
here,
and
it
doesn't
violate
the
prohibition
on
coordinated
expenditure
for
the
party
to
do
something
that
is
consistent
with
the
candidate's
campaign.
what
the
coordinated
expenditure
prohibition
was
designed
to
prohibit
was
the
candidate
essentially
paying
the
media
bills
for
the
candidate,
and
the
record
contains
evidence
that
the
over...
that
the
predominant
forum
that
coordinated
expenditures
take
is
exactly
that.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
i'm
not
at
all
sure
that
it
would
be,
justice
scalia.
there
may
be
difficult
cases
at
the
margin,
as
the
donor
takes
more
initiative
and
the
candidate
less.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
coordination
isn't
even
a
statutory
term,
but
the
federal
election
commission
has
been
developing
regulations
to
try
and
make
more
precise
exactly
what
is
prohibited
here.
it
is
clear,
it
has
been
clear
from
the
outset
of
the
statute
that
the
purpose
of
the
prohibition
here,
it's
a
permission
for
independent
expenditures.
the
limitation
on
coordinated
expenditures
is
to
prevent
the
candidate,
prevent
anyone...
party
or
anyone
else...
from
making
contributions
in
the
form
of
paying
the
candidate's
bills.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
that's
a
feature
of
any
independent
expenditure.
it
is
so--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--no.
although
these
things
are
all
a
matter
of
degree,
it
is
the
case,
i
mean,
it's...
it
is
the
case
that
congress
thought
that
contributions
over
a
certain
limit
created
a
potential
for
corruption,
and
that
to
make
that
enforceable,
it
had
to
prohibit
as
well
or
limit
as
well
things
that
are
the
functional
equivalent
of
contributions,
such
as--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--it
may
be
that
a
narrower
definition
of
coordinated
expenditures,
then,
seems
to
be
sort
of
in
the
air
at
the
moment
is
what
would
serve
this
method,
this
problem
best,
and
the
federal
election
commission
at
the
moment
has
under
advisement,
is
considering
rewriting
its...
considering
new
regulations
regarding
the
definition.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
congress
was
trying
to
strike
a
balance
here
in
the
light
of
what
this
court
said
it
could
and
couldn't
do
in
respect
of,
on
the
one
hand,
protecting
the
speech
interests
of
contributors,
of
spenders,
of
independent
spending
and
on
the
other
hand
attempting
to
guard
against
the
risk,
the
reality
and
the
appearance
of
corruption
which
at
its
narrowest
is
quid
pro
quo
and
moving
out
from
that
is
implicit,
excessive
compliance
that
is
like
a
quid
pro
quo.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes.
it
has
been
observed
before
that
congress
perhaps...
well,
that
congress
is
fully
familiar
with
the
practices
of
campaign
expenditures
and
campaign
fund-raising
and
with
the
risks
and
benefits
that
various
forms
of
fund-raising
have
and
that
having
evaluated
all
of
those
risks
and
benefits
and
taken
guidance
from
these
courts,
the
distinctions
that
this
court
has
drawn,
its
effort
to,
to
make
those
judgments
is
entitled
at
least
to
some,
some
credit.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
i
think
if
we...
i
think
if
we--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
common
sense
points
in
several
directions.
i
think
that
the
most
basic
common
sense
proposition
here
is
that
so
long
as
there's
a
limit
on
what
donors
can
give
to
a
candidate,
they
will
be
trying
to
find
ways
to
get
around
it,
and
one
good
way
is
to
use
intermediaries
that
are
not
subject
to
the
same
limits
and
that
congress
recognized
that
and
attempted
to
address
it
without
crippling
other
important
functions
by
putting
a
limit
on
the
contributions,
by
not
prohibiting,
but
putting
a
limit
on
the
contributions
and
coordinated
expenditures
that
parties
can
make
to
candidates.
there
is
a
second
corruption
concern,
and
that
is
the
concern,
not
that
the
party
would
act
as
a
conduit,
but
that
the
party
leaders
in
charge
of
dispensing
funds
would,
in
effect,
exact...
pay
for
votes,
would
themselves
tie
money
to
legislative
actions.
there
is
no
direct
evidence
in
the
record
of
that
happening,
but
it
is
the
case
that
if
a
candidate's
own
family
can
be
subject
to
a
prohibition
on
contributions
in
order
to
protect
corruption,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
being
too
close
to
corrupt,
and--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
in
nixon
against
shrink...
shrink,
missouri
political
action
committee,
the
question
was
whether
the
corruption,
the
potential
for
corruption
that
justified
the
federal
statute
also
justified
the
state
statute,
and
the
court
said
that
it
wasn't
necessary
to
develop
new
evidence
of
essentially
the
same,
essentially
the
same
problem.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes,
it
does.
but
so,
in
fact,
does
this
case,
in
that
coordinated
expenditures
are,
in
effect,
contributions
or
if
this
court
were
to
conclude
that
they
are
not,
then
it
would
be
decided--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
as
i
suggested,
it
does,
however,
i
think,
have
the
same
ring
to
say
that
a
political
party
can
facilitate
the
very
transaction
that
you
were
just
describing;
that
is,
the
fat
cat
now
not
giving
money
directly
to
the
candidate
because
he's
barred
from
doing
so,
but
giving
it
to
the
party
to
transmit
to
the
candidate
with
everybody
understanding
exactly
what's
going
on.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well
i
don't
think
it's
any
more
prophylactic
than
the
prohibition
on
contributions
in
the
first
place.
not
every
contribution,
in
fact,
is
corrupt,
but
a
limit...
it's
not
a
prohibition.
a
limit
on
contributions
is
designed
to
minimize
the
risk
of--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
i
think
the
function
of
the
family
is
to
advance
the
interests
of
its
members,
but
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
i
hope
you
held
her
in
high
regard.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
thank
you.
i
just
want
to
make
a
few
points.
the
rationale
for
the
party
expenditure
provision
has
always
been
a
conduit
theory.
the
structure
of
the
statute
has
changed,
and
so
just
exactly
how
the
party
could
act
as
a
conduit
to
evade
whatever
limits
existed
has
changed,
but
right
from
the
beginning,
the
concern
was
that
the
party
could
act
to
enable
another
donor
to
evade
the
limits
by--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
at
pages
28
and
29
of
our
brief,
we
quote
some
legislative
history.
i
think
my
colleague
discounts
it
because
it
was
at
a
time
when
the
structure
of
the
statute
was
somewhat
different
so
the
evasion
and
the
conduit
that
was
possible
was
somewhat
different
but
it
was
nevertheless
then,
and
is
now,
aimed
at
preventing
parties
from
enabling
individuals
to
avoid
their
limits.
i
mean,
at
page
28,
senator
matthias
says
that
the
point
of
this
is
to
prevent
an
indirect
contribution
by
a
candidate...
by
a
contributor
to
a
candidate
going
through
the
party.
that
was
why
the
provision
was
in
the
statute.
the
coordinated
expenditures
are
like
contributions
and
it
was
the
premise
of
buckley,
over
some
objection
to
be
sure,
that
they
have
a
greater
potential
for
corruption
than
independent
expenditures.
that's
true
for
parties
and
for
political
action
committees,
as
well
as
for
individuals,
and
it's
true
for
fat
cat
contributors,
as
well
as
for
small
contributors,
so
the
right
that's
being
claimed
here,
the
constitutional
right
here
to
unlimited
coordinated
expenditures
is,
in
effect,
a
claim
of
right
to
unlimited

the
colorado
republican
party
isn't
making
that
argument,
but
it
seems
to
follow
from
their
argument
because
parties...
and
the
reason
why,
although
parties
are
different
from
other
kinds
of
actors
in
the
system,
they
nevertheless
need
to
be
subjected
to
some
limits,
is
precisely

as
intermediaries,
they
can
serve
to
defeat
the
other
limits
of
the
statute.
a
party
has
no
more...
that
was
a
judgment
congress
was
entitled
to
make,
not
compelled
to
make,
but
entitled
to
make.
it
solves
a
part
of
the
problem
but
not
the
whole
problem.
political
parties,
though,
have
no
more
a
constitutional
right
to
exemption
from
limits
on
contributions
than
do
political
action
committees
and,
in
fact,
congress
gave
them
much
higher
limits.
