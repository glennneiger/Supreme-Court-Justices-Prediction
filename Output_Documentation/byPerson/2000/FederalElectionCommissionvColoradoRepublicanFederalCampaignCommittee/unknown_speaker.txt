unknown
speaker
i
now
recognize
you
by
your
true
name.
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
you
do
have
a
problem
in
sustaining
this
part
of
the
congressional
act
because
the
basis
for
sustaining
the
limits
on
contributions
is
the
corruption
rationale
that
has
been
in
our
cases
for,
you
know,
50,
60
years.
but
it's
very
difficult,
at
least
for
me
to
see
how
receiving
a
contribution
would
corrupt
a
political
party.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
those
informal
arrangements
are
that
actually
this
money
is
given
to
the
party
but
we
know
you're
going
to
give
it
to
candidate
x,
certainly
the
congress
can
prohibit
that.
perhaps
it
already
has.
unknown
speaker
let
me
get
this
straight.
i
can
understand
why
there's,
you
know,
corruption
if
the
donor
gives
the
candidate
money
and
there's
a
quid
pro
quo,
the
candidate
says
i'll
vote
for
your
bill.
but
you
allow
individuals
to
spend
$100,000
in
their
own
advertising
for
this
candidate,
and
it
says
at
the
bottom
of
the
ad,
you
know,
paid
for
by
schwartz,
and
the
candidate
knows
schwartz
has
bought
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
of
television
advertising,
that
is
perfectly
okay,
right?
unknown
speaker
but
if
schwartz
gives
$100,000
to
the
democratic
party,
we're
suddenly
worried
that
the
candidate
is
going
to
be
corrupted
because
schwartz
gave
$100,000?
i
can't
understand
that.
that
seems
to
me
so
fanciful
to
think
that
the
one
situation
presents,
you
know,
an
opportunity
for
corruption
and
the
other
doesn't.
you're
much
better
off
if
you
want
to
corrupt
schwartz,
spending
the
money
on
an
advertisement
that
says
presented,
you
know,
presented
by
xyz
corporation.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
what
does
the
party
use
its
limited
funds
for?
i
mean,
the
whole
purpose
of
a
party
is
to
support
candidates,
and
to
say
that
the
party
can't
use
its
funds
for
candidates
is
to
say
that
you
know,
parties
don't...
cannot
play
a
significant
part
in
american
politics.
unknown
speaker
and
you
talk
about
the
significant
first
amendment
value
of
an
individual
being
able
to
spend
his
money
on
an
ad
for
the
candidate,
there
is
significant
first
amendment
value
in
that.
it
is
not
clear
to
me
that
there
is
any
less
first
amendment
value
in
people
being
able
to
band
together
in
political
parties
and
in
unison
support
political
candidates.
that's
a
very
important
first
amendment
value,
too,
and
you're
saying
they
can't
do
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
saying
they
can
do
it
to
a
very
limited
degree,
although
rich
individuals
can
take
out
their
own
television
ads,
a
party
which
gets
contributions
from
joe
sixpack
in
five
and
ten
dollar
amounts
cannot
do
that
to
support
a
candidate.
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--i
mean,
we're
only
talking
here
about
the
coordinated
hard
money,
so
to
speak,
party
expenditures
on
behalf
of
candidates.
unknown
speaker
that's
such
a
tiny
segment
of
the
problem.
we're
not
talking
about
soft
money
here,
right?
unknown
speaker
not
talking
about
general
limits
on
contributions?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
given
that
it's
a
small
segment
of
the
problem,
what
showing
is
there
that
there
are
enough
problems
with
this
small
segment
of
corruption
that
justifies
the
limit?
i
mean,
it's
a
little--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
know
quite
how
to
deal
with
it.
it's
such
a
small
segment
of
the
problem.
now
what's
the
justification
here
for
this
limit?
unknown
speaker
so
the
danger
is
that
contributors
to
political
parties
are
using
those
contributions
to
somehow
corrupt
the
candidates?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
kind
of
an
indirect
sort
of
a
thing?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
the
earmarking
provision
isn't
sufficient?
unknown
speaker
and
where
do
we
look
for
this
evidence
of
concern?
to
stray
remarks
by
some
members
of
congress
or
is
there
anything
else?
unknown
speaker
but
you
think
that's
not
sufficient?
unknown
speaker
is
the
argument,
general
underwood,
it
is
not
that
the
party
is
corrupted,
i
take
it,
because
that
would
seem
just
fatuous,
but
the
party
is
kind
of
a
means
to
corrupting
the
candidate
himself?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
a
prophylactic
rule,
kind
of?
unknown
speaker
but
it
covers
much
more
than
earmarked
funds.
unknown
speaker
it
covers
any
funds
that
the
party
has,
so
it
is
prophylactic.
it's
excluding
the
party
from
doing
many
things
that
wouldn't
be
corrupting,
right?
unknown
speaker
because
this
is
the
fear
that
some
of
them
might
be.
unknown
speaker
sure,
but
that's
prophylactic,
too,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with--
unknown
speaker
--i
was
just
going
to
ask
you,
do
you
agree
with
the
proposition,
or
to
what
extent
do
you
disagree
with
the
proposition
that
the
basic
function
of
the
party
is
to
elect
candidates
and
therefore
a
limitation
on
the
ability
of
the
party
to
give
money
to
candidates
pretty
well
disables
the
party
from
doing
what
it
was
created
to
do?
unknown
speaker
so
it
serves
free
speech
for
the
party
to
spend
money
on
behalf
of
a
candidate
without
discussing
with
that
candidate
the
candidate's
views
and
to
make
sure
that
the
candidate's
campaign
is
the
same
as
the
party.
it
serves
free
speech
if
the
party
doesn't
coordinate
with
the
person
that
it's
backing.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
very
strange,
very
strange
calculus.
unknown
speaker
what
if,
what
if
the
party
consults
the
candidate
and
says,
you
know,
we're
thinking
of
running
a
series
of
issue
ads,
and
we're
going
to
say
you're
a
big
supporter
of
gun
control?
now
you
that
will
help
you
or
hurt
you?
we
don't
want
to
do
it
if
you
think
it
will
hurt
you.
what
about
it?
and
he
says,
you
know,
one
or
the
other,
it
doesn't
matter.
would
that
not
be
a
coordinated
expenditure?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
a
pretty
fundamental
question.
i
don't
think
that's
a
marginal
question.
this
question
has
to
come
up
all
the
time.
can
the
party
consult
the
candidate
at
least
on
what
issues
the
candidate
wants
the
party
to
address
in
its
advertising?
it
sounds
like
coordination
to
me.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
let's
say
that
this
is
not
a
coordinated
expense.
are
the
parties
allowed
to
do
it?
which
would
mean
that
a
fat
cat
industrialist
bent
on
corrupting
the
candidate
could
write
to
the
candidate
a
letter
and
say,
you
know,
i'm
giving
$100,000
to
the
democratic
national
committee
to
spend
on
gun
control
issue
advertising,
which
i
am
sure
will
help
your
campaign.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
what
i'm
saying
is,
once
you
allow
that,
doesn't
that
have
the
same
corruptive
effect
as
what
you're
trying
to
prohibit?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
also
the
case
that
the
congress
under
the
statute
that
you're
defending
forces
exactly
the
type
of
indirect
support
that
justice
scalia
has
just
described
instead
of
having
it
out
in
the
open
where
everybody
knows
who
is
supporting
who
and
who
is
paying
money
for
whom.
that
seems
to
me
just
completely
contrary
to
the
whole
idea
of
the
truth
that
the
first
amendment
is
designed
to
vindicate.
unknown
speaker
no,
we're
assuming...
i
think
we
were
assuming
a
narrow
definition
of
coordinated
expenses.
we
were
assuming
that
the
parties
spending
money
on
gun
control
advertising,
after
consulting
with
the
candidate
about
that,
is
not
a
coordinated
expense,
so
the
party
would
be
able
to
do
it.
we
were
assuming
a
narrow
definition.
and
the
narrower
the
definition
is,
the
more
it
raises
the
same
problems
of
flow-through
to
the
candidate
from
identified
malefactors
of
great
wealth
that,
that
you're
trying
to
prohibit.
unknown
speaker
did
congress,
having
made
the...
drawn
the
line
where
it
did
to
whatever
expertise
that
branch
of
government
has
with
political
campaigns
and
campaign
spending?
unknown
speaker
do
we
owe
any
deference
to
common
sense
in
recognizing
that
when
congress
draws
up
campaign
funding
legislation,
it
is
more
likely
to
draw
up
a
system
that
favors
incumbents
and
is
it
not
true
that
this
rule
of
course
favors
incumbents
because
the
one
who
suffers
the
most
when
he
can't
get
significant
funding
from
the
party
is
the
new
candidate,
the
unknown
face
who
is
running
against
an
incumbent?
and
that's
what
happens.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
surprise
me
that
congress
would
not
be
terribly
upset
by
this
restriction.
it
favors
incumbents
all
the
time.
unknown
speaker
how
does
the
record
on
the
potential
for
corruption
differ
here
than
what
was
before
the
court
in
nixon
against,
what,
shrink?
unknown
speaker
that
was...
shrink,
missouri,
involved
contribution
limits,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
your
corruption
rationale
is
much
less
if
you're
talking
about
a
big
wheel
or,
you
know,
a
fat
cat
donating
a
lot
of
money
to
a
candidate,
the
idea
is
the
fat
cat
is
going
to
get
something
in
return,
but
the
idea
that
a
political
party
donating
to
a
candidate
is
going
to
get
something
in
return
just
doesn't
have
the
same
ring
to
it.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
a
form
of
a
prophylactic
rule
which
we
have
never
sustained
in
the
first
amendment
context,
i
don't
think.
unknown
speaker
but
it
depends
on
how
much
you're
hurting
the
person
that's
being
prohibited.
i
just
don't
agree
with
you
that,
my
goodness,
if
we
can
do
it
to
families
we
can
certainly
do
it
to
political
parties.
i
mean,
with
few
exceptions,
the
whole
reason
for
being
of
a
family
is
not
to
get
the
father
or
mother
elected
to
office,
and
that
is
the
whole...
that
is
the
whole
reason
for
being
of
a
political
party,
and
to
say
that
it
can't
do
that
in
the
most
and
perhaps
the
only
effective
way,
by
coordinating
its
expenditures
with
the
very
candidate
is
a
really
great
impingement
upon
the
functioning
of
the
party,
unlike
the
family.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
general
greenwood.
in
my
elementary
school
there
was
a
girl
named
barbara
greenwood.
unknown
speaker
mr.
baran.
chief,
i'm
scalia.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
you
say
the
majority
of
state
laws.
how
many
states
have
a
prohibition
of
this
sort,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
now,
if
you
win,
and
i
guess
this
is
their
main
rationale,
what
they're
saying,
if
you
win,
to
give
a
practical
example,
if
you
have
a
family
of
four,
i
guess
candidate
x
who
is
running
for
the
senate,
can
take
$4,000.
and
then
if
you
win,
instead
of
$4,000,
he
could
take
$80,000
through
the
party.
all
right,
so
if
you
assume
a
senate
race
that
costs
$4
million,
let's
say,
the
difference
would
be
between
whether
you
had
to
find
50
willing
donors
with
families
or
a
thousand.
so
couldn't
congress
conclude
that
where
a
senator
is
dependent
upon
50
families
with
$80,000
each,
the
appearance,
anyway,
that
the
senator
will
be
quite
beholden
to
those
50
is
far
greater
than
where
he
must,
in
fact,
get
that
$4
million
from
at
least
a
thousand?
now,
that
it
seems
to
me
is
what
the
government's
argument
boils
down
to,
and
they're
saying
we
never
know
about
these
corruption
things
or
the
appearance,
but
the
difference
between
fifty
families
and
a
thousand
families
is
as
good
as
any.
unknown
speaker
because
they
limit
the
spending,
as
you
just
pointed
out,
to
the
party,
to
the
candidate
directly
to
a
hundred
and
some
odd
thousand
dollars.
so
it's
a
kind
of
compromise.
but
if
you
win
this,
the
limitation's
gone,
and
therefore
the
first
thing
a
candidate
does
is
he
says
to
the
50
people
who
know
him
the
best,
thank
you
for
the
four.
now
i'll
tell
you
how
you
give
me
$76,000
more.
just
write
the
check
to
the
party,
and
i'll
keep
a
tally,
and
so
do
they.
and
believe
me,
i'll
know
where
it
comes
from.
unknown
speaker
isn't
there
then
a
limit
on
what
the
party
can
give
him?
unknown
speaker
well,
within
that
limit,
right,
but
the
different--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
presume--
unknown
speaker
--there
are...
are
there
not
instances
in
the
record
in
which
individuals
who
have
contributed
their
maximum
directly
to
the
candidate
have
then
made
contributions
to
the
political
party?
i
mean,
i
assume
that.
there's
no
dispute
that
that
has
happened.
unknown
speaker
if
that
has
happened,
then
exactly
what
justice
breyer
is
describing
can
occur,
but
it
occurs
in
comparatively
piddling
amounts
as
against
what
would
be
possible
if
you
win
this
case.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
assumption--
unknown
speaker
--why
is
that
implausible?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
we
may
be
playing
with
words.
there
are
instances
of
contributors
to
individuals
who
are
also
contributors
to
the
party,
and
i
suppose
those
instances
do
not
stand
out
as
outrageously
obvious
examples
of,
you
know,
something
close
to
quid
pro
quo
because
the
amounts
are
small.
we're
not
able
to
interpret
the
things
more
finely
than
that,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
suggestion
of
the
question
is
intuitively
sound,
and
i
don't
know
why
it
isn't
intuitively
sound.
you're
saying,
well,
it's
not
intuitively
sound
because
we
have
no
examples
of
what
would
go
on
if
i
won
the
case.
and
we
don't
have
those
examples
because
we
have
the
current
law
in
place.
unknown
speaker
i'm
sorry,
i
knew
that,
but
i
may
have
read
the
newspapers
with
a
cynical
eye,
but
it
seems
what
i
read
in
the
papers
says
that
some
candidates,
anyway,
write
letters
to
their
friends
and
say,
now,
write
checks
for
x
to
me
personally,
then
you
max
out.
now
here's
what
you
do
next,
write
some
checks
to
the
party.
now
at
this
level
you
max
out
again.
now
here's
what
you
do
after
that.
you
write
some
soft
money
checks,
and
there
is
no
max.
now,
have
i
read
the
newspapers
wrong
or
is
that
possibly
practice
in
respect
to
some
political
candidates?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no,
but--
unknown
speaker
--no,
i--
unknown
speaker
--i
see
why
we're...
is
this
the
point
of
what
i
consider
our
miscommunication.
unknown
speaker
i
have
not
specified
something.
you're
turning
your
answers
on
the
fact
that
you
can't
earmark
the,
the
circuitous
route,
and
so
for
my
assumptions
to
be
correct,
i
have
to
be
assuming
a
fact
that's
debatable,
and
that
is
that
the
tally
system
works
approximately
similar
to
earmarking,
but
on
my
assumption
that
that's
factually
true,
we
get
to
my
questions,
but
on
the
assumption
it's
not
factually
true,
then
your
answers
are...
is
that
the
point
of
disagreement?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
unless
there's
earmarking,
i
suppose
the
opportunity
of
corruption
is
very
little
greater
under
what
the
regime
would
be
without
this
prohibition
than
it
is
what
the
regime
would
be
with
it.
i
suppose
any
candidate
would
feel
sympathetic
to
someone
who
was
agreed
to
give
$80,000
to
the
state
party,
which
he
knows
will
be
used
to
support
him
even
though
not
in
coordination
with
him.
isn't
there...
don't
you
think
your
candidates
generally
feel
sympathetic
to
people
who
give
a
lot
of
money
to
the
state
committee,
even
under
the
current
regime?
unknown
speaker
knowing
that
the
state
regime
will
spend
a
lot
of
money
to
help
them
in
one
way
or
another,
coordinated
or
not?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
practical
effect
of
striking
it
down?
is
it
significant
or
not?
i'm
trying
to
figure
it
out.
unknown
speaker
you
can
do
it
as
long
as
it's
not
coordinated.
what
is
the...
why
does
the
restriction
on
coordination
give
you
a
problem?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
how
important
this
is,
but
what
you
just
said
suggests
this
to
me,
that
there
sometimes
is
a
difference
of
approach
to
an
election
between
the
candidate
and
the
party
and
if
you
allow
this
statute
to
be
held
unconstitutional,
you
would
allow
the
party
to
exercise
its
influence
to
cause
the
candidate
to
shift
its
views
to
accept
those
of
the
party.
isn't
that
one
of
the...
one
of
the
factors
that's
involved
here?
unknown
speaker
mr.
baran,
you
were
going
to
give
two
responses
to
justice
o'connor.
you
said
there
were
two
reasons.
i
was
waiting
for
the
second
one
but
just
before
we
get
too
far
away
from
it,
what
was
the
second?
unknown
speaker
okay
but
that's,
i
mean,
that
may
be
a
very
good
argument
to
congress,
maybe
a
dangerous
argument
because
the
soft
money
opponents
may
find
something
to
run
with
there,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
an
argument,
and
i
realize
you
were
asked
to
get
into
this,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
an
argument
that's
going
to
help
us
decide
this
case.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
so
much
of
the...
the
other
side's
position
here
depends
on
the
relationship
between
the
coordinated
expenditures
and
the
individual
contribution
limits
to
the
candidates
themselves.
do
you,
do
you
contest
the,
i
guess,
intuitive
assumption
that
if
a
candidate
had
the
choice
of
retaining
the
present
limits
on
contributions
directly
to
that
candidate,
and
on
the
other
hand,
having
a
system
in
which
there
were
no
contribution
limits,
he
could
accept
any
amount
from
anybody,
do
you,
do
you
contest
the
intuitive
judgment
that
he
would
probably
accept
the
latter
system
and
say,
sure,
let
me
accept
any
amount
of
money?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
in
lieu
of
the
current
system
of
limitations
on
contributions
to
make.
unknown
speaker
won't
the
first
group,
the
group
that
says,
yes,
i
would
like
to
replace
the
present
system
and
be
able
to
take
as
much
as
anyone
wants
to
give
me,
wouldn't
that
first
group
prefer
a
system
in
which
there
was
no
limitation
upon
coordinated
expenditures
by
the
party
because
that
first
group
could
achieve
very
much
the
same
result
in
that
way,
isn't
that
so?
unknown
speaker
well,
sure.
but
now
we're,
now
we're...
what
i'm
positing
is
a
system
in
which
the
political
party,
which
everybody
esteems
for
different
reasons,
perhaps,
but
everybody
supports,
now,
on
your
theory
the
political
party
can
simply
be
given
another
useful
task
and
the
useful
task,
in
effect,
would
be
to
eliminate
the
need
of
the
candidate
to
be
scrambling
for
the
$100
contributions
if
it
could
accept,
in
effect,
through
the
party,
contributions
in
the
amounts
that
justice
breyer
was
talking
about
in
his
hypo
a
while
ago.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
perceives
it
as
a
benefit,
why
does
it
have
the
restriction
on
coordinated
expenditures?
apparently,
it
does
not
perceive
it
as
a
total
benefit?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
certainly
a
rationale
that
supports
spending
limits
generally,
but
i
don't
know
that
it
is,
it
is
or
was
meant
to
be
the
exhaustive
rationale
for
a
distinction
between
coordinated
and
uncoordinated
because
if
that
were
the
only
issue
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
distinction.
unknown
speaker
a
spending
limit
is
a
spending
limit.
and
if
you're
distinguishing
between
coordinated
and
uncoordinated,
presumably
you
have
a
different
policy
in
mind,
and
i
presume,
and
i
haven't
heard
anything
to
the
contrary,
that
the
policy
is
exactly
the
intuitive
judgment
that
was
behind
the
original
hypo
of
justice
breyer's.
unknown
speaker
did
they
do
it
for
no
reason
at
all?
unknown
speaker
did
they
do
it
for
no
reason
at
all?
unknown
speaker
they
don't
need
to
distinguish
between
coordinated
and
uncoordinated
if
that's
what
they're
concerned
with?
unknown
speaker
now
there
are.
are
you
saying
that
the
rationale
for
what
happened
here
was
just
inadvertence.
nobody
thought
about
it?
nobody
went
back
and
said,
hey,
we
don't
need
this
now?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
baran.
general
underwood,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
just
said
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history,
not
one
senator,
not
one
congressman
ever
said
anything
like
that.
unknown
speaker
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
00-191,
federal
election
commission
versus
the
colorado
republican
federal
campaign
committee
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
