justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
it
began
sometime
ago
when
the
federal
election
commission
complained
that
the
respondent,
a
committee
of
the
republican
party
had
violated
a
provision
of
the
federal
election
campaign
act
by
spending
too
much
money
in
connection
with
the
1986
senate
campaign.
the
party
defended
itself
by
claiming
the
spending
limitations
which
we
have
called
the
party
expenditure
provision
violated
the
first
amendment.
when
the
case
first
came
to
us
five
years
ago,
our
principal
opinion
agreed
with
the
party
up
to
a
point.
we
held
that
the
party
expenditure
provision
was
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
the
actual
expenditures
at
issue
there.
our
analysis
stressed
that
the
party
had
made
the
expenditures
without
any
co-ordination
with
a
candidate.
they
were
thus
independent
expenditures
within
the
meaning
of
a
series
of
the
cases
starting
25
years
ago
with
buckley
and
valeo,
in
which
we
held
that
limits
on
independent
campaign
expenditures
by
individuals
and
non-party
groups
violated
the
first
amendment.
in
the
decision
five
years
ago,
we
found
no
reason
not
to
afford
political
parties.
the
same
first
amendment
protection
we
had
afforded
to
those
non-party
spenders,
but
that
did
not
end
the
lawsuit.
we
remanded
for
consideration
of
the
party’s
claim
that
“the
limits
on
expenditure
by
a
political
party
in
connection
with
congressional
elections
are
facially
unconstitutional
and
thus
unenforceable
even
as
to
spending
that
is
coordinated
with
a
candidate”.
the
district
court
held
for
the
party
and
a
divided
penal
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
tenth
circuit.
in
buckley,
this
court
held
that
the
federal
election
campaign
act's
limitations
on
campaign
contributions
were
generally
constitutional,
justified
by
a
substantial
government
interest
in
combating
corruption
of
the
political
system.
but
we
held
that
the
act’s
limitations
on
election
expenditures
violated
the
first
amendment.
later
cases
respected
this
line
between
contributions
and
expenditures,
which
is
grounded
in
two
distinctions.
contribution
restraints
generally
curb
less
expressive
and
associational
activity
than
expenditure
limits
do.
unlimited
contributions
are
clearly
linked
to
political
corruption
than
the
unlimited
expenditures
are,
at
least
where
the
expenditures
are
not
coordinated
with
the
candidate
or
his
campaign.
these
distinctions
are
less
clear
when
the
expenditures
are
coordinated
with
the
candidates
and
in
fact,
in
the
act
itself
congress
defined
contributions,
so
as
to
include
coordinated
expenditures.
in
buckley,
where
we
considered
contribution
and
expenditure
limits
applicable
to
individuals
and
nonparty
groups,
we
explain
that
treating
coordinated
expenditures
like
contribution
prevents
attempts
to
circumvent
the
act
through
coordinated
expenditures
amounting
to
disguised
contributions.
in
buckley,
we
effectively
accorded
those
coordinated
expenditures,
the
same
first
amendment
treatment
as
pure
contributions
and
we
upheld
the
limitation
on
them.
the
issue
in
this
case
as
it
comes
before
us
this
time
is
whether
a
political
party
is
in
a
different
position
from
individuals
and
nonparty
groups
giving
it
a
claim
to
demand
a
higher
standard
of
scrutiny
before
its
coordinated
spending
can
be
limited.
for
reasons
explained
in
detail
in
our
opinion,
we
reject
the
party’s
claim
to
be
unique
among
political
spenders
in
a
way
that
triggers
categorically
or
would
trigger
categorically
a
different
treatment.
we,
therefore,
apply
the
same
scrutiny
that
we
applied
to
contribution
and
coordinated
expenditure
limits
in
buckley.
we
ask
whether
the
limit
is
clearly
drawn
to
match
a
sufficiently
important
governmental
interest
and
in
applying
this
test,
we
conclude
that
the
limit
withstands
the
party’s
facial
challenge.
experience
under
the
present
law
confirms
a
serious
threat
of
abuse
from
unlimited
coordinated
parties
spending.
despite
years
of
enforcement
of
the
challenge
limits,
substantial
evidence
demonstrates
how
candidates,
donors,
and
parties
test
the
limits
of
the
current
law,
and
it
shows
beyond
serious
doubt
how
contribution
limits
upheld
in
buckley
would
be
eroded
if
inducement
to
circumvent
them
were
enhance
by
declaring
parties
coordinated
spending
without
any
limitation
in
wide
open.
donors
who
had
already
made
the
maximum
contributions
directly
to
a
candidate
would
contribute
more
to
a
party
with
the
tacit
understanding
that
their
money
would
reach
the
candidate
in
the
form
of
coordinated
expenditures.
certain
attempts
of
this
sort
of
circumvention
would
doubtless
escape
the
act’s
provisions
addressing
earmarking
of
contributions
and
congress
was
entitled
to
deal
with
the
problem
by
limiting
the
amount
of
money
that
could
flow
from
the
party
contribute
to
the
candidate
in
the
form
of
coordinated
expenditures.
