unknown
speaker
the
second
case
is
fiore
versus
white,
no.
98-942.
the
background
facts
of
this
case
are
stated
in
the
opinion
we
issued
last
term.
petitioner
challenged
his
pennsylvania
conviction
for
operating
a
hazardous
of
waste
facility
without
a
license.
he
was
denied
relief
in
the
pennsylvania
courts
and
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
on
federal
habeas.
we
granted
certiorari
to
determine
whether
his
conviction
was
consistent
with
the
due
process
clause.
because
we
were
uncertain
whether
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court’s
decision
in
scarpone
represented
a
change
in
the
law
of
pennsylvania,
we
certify
the
question
to
that
court
and
that
court
replied
that,
no,
it
did
not
announced
a
new
rule
of
law.
because
scarpone
was
not
a
new
law
but
represented
the
law
of
pennsylvania
at
the
time
fiore's
conviction
became
final,
the
only
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
pennsylvania
can
constitutionally
convict
fiore
of
a
crime
of
that
its
statute
properly
interpreted
by
its
own
court
does
not
prohibit.
in
jackson
versus
virginia
and
winship,
we
held
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
forbids
a
state
to
convict
a
person
of
a
crime
without
proving
the
elements
of
that
crime
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
in
this
case,
failure
to
posses
a
permit
is
a
basic
element
of
a
crime
of
which
fiore
was
convicted,
and
the
parties
agree
that
the
commonwealth
presented
no
evidence
whatsoever
to
provide
that
basic
element.
the
commonwealth
concedes
that
fiore
did
posses
a
permit.
fiore’s
conviction
therefore
fails
to
satisfy
the
federal
constitutional
demands.
in
a
per
curiam
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
contrary
judgment
of
the
third
circuit
and
remand
this
case
for
further
proceedings.
our
decision
is
unanimous.
