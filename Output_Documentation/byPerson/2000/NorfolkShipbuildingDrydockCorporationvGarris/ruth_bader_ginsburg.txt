justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
arguing...
the
limitation,
it
seems
to
me...
death
wouldn't
matter.
it
would
be
just
as
land
locked
if
it
had
been
mere
injury,
and
that's
the
question
i'd
like
you
to
answer
under
the
law
as
you
see
it.
suppose
mr.
garris
had
not
been
killed,
he'd
just
been
badly
injured.
would
he
have
an
action
under
federal
maritime
law
for
negligence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
don't
change
a
thing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
would?
so,
then
you
can't...
then
you're
not
making
a
distinction
based
on
land
locked
versus
something
else;
you're
making
a
distinction
based
on
death
versus
injury.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
all
of
your...
your
discussion
about
state
domain
versus
admiralty,
maritime...
it
seems
to
fall
apart
when
one
recognizes
that
it
can
be
the
very
same
accident.
it's
maritime
if
he's
merely
injured,
but
no
maritime
responsibility
if
he's
killed.
and
that
seems
to
be
a
hard
line
to
explain
to
anyone,
at
least
who's
not
a
lawyer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
were
giving
something
beyond
historical
patchwork...
you
were
giving
some
kind
of
rationale
distinction
between
land
locked,
sea
duty,
federal/state...
and
i
could
accept
all
that
were
it
not
for
that
the
distinction
is
only
death
versus
injury.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why?
tungus
just
said
you
can
take
the
state
wrongful
death
claim.
doesn't...
well,
let's
take
yamaha,
where
we,
this
court
recognized
that
you
could
have
a
claim
under
the
state
wrongful
death
act.
it
took
that
position
even
on
the
assumption...
and
it
was
only
an
assumption
in
that
case...
that
you
could
also
have
a
claim
under
moragne.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
a
case
where
you
could
have
both
state
and
federal
remedies
if
there
was
a
federal
remedy,
and
we
said
if
there
was
a
federal
remedy,
that
wouldn't
preclude
also
having
a
state
remedy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
then
your
answer
must
be
in
the
case
of
injury
it's
only
maritime
law...
it's
only
federal
law,
not
state
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said...
before
you
go
on
to
talbot,
you
said
that
symmetry
and
treating
like
situations
alike...
this
survivor,
this
mother...
what
was
the
recovery
that
she
got?
she
got
a
worker's
compensation
recovery?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
was
what?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
up
to
three
thousand
dollars?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
yet
if
her
son
had
survived,
there
would
have
been
a
large
recovery,
and
you
say
that
that
was
okay,
to
have
negligence
under
maritime
law.
why
isn't
there
a
gross
inequality
in
those
two
situations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
the
question
is
whether
it's,
the
line
between
injury
and
death
is
a
valid
one.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
couldn't
you
pick
that...
why
couldn't
you
pick
up
that
part
from
state
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
doesn't
federal
law
do
that
in
other
instances,
not
have
an
independent
federal
law
of
who
will
be
the
survivors
in
the
case
of
a
federal
tort?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
i
wasn't
asking
you,
the
state
law
in
tungus
was
the
liability
as
well
as
who
picks
it
up.
but
now
where...
you
seem
to
be
suggesting
that
if
you
had
federal
law,
you
would
also
have
to
invent
who
the
survivors
are
for
purposes
of
wrongful
death,
and
i'm
suggesting
that
there
is
no
reason
why
you
couldn't
pick
that
up
from
state
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
again,
if
you're
going
to
talk
about
impact
on
commerce,
there
really
can't
be
any
difference
between
injury
and
death,
so
i
think
once
you
concede
that
the
injury
would
be
covered
by
federal
law,
you
can't
make
an
argument
about
the
commerce
clause
that
wouldn't
apply
to
both.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
could
have
well
happened
on
the
sidewalk,
but
it
happened
to
happen
on
the
ship.
there's
nothing
about
that
conduct
of
leaving
the
banana
peel
that's
maritime,
or
do
you
see
something
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
isn't
that
something
that
the
court
should
now
respect,
even
if
it
made
no
sense
but
it
was...
it
emerges
from
the
english
common
law,
that
there
was
no
common
law
action
for
wrongful
death,
and
now
we
have
dohsa
and
we
have
the
possibility
of
picking
up
state
wrongful
death
acts
for
watery
deaths.
why
couldn't
one
say,
even
if
it
made
no
sense,
this
distinction.
between
surviving
injury
and
death?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
the...
the
question
we
were
given
in
yamaha
was
does
the
state
wrongful
death
act
apply?
there
was
nothing
about...
there
wasn't
a
claim
before
us
under
federal
maritime
law.
the
question
was
whether
you
could
apply
the
state
wrongful
death
act.
i
take
it
what
you're
telling
us
is
that
mr.
ferrini
was
right
when
he
said
if
you
prevail,
that
there
is
a
federal
maritime
law
claim
for
wrongful
death,
then
there
is
no
longer
the
claim
that
this
court
thought
was
a
viable
one
in
yamaha,
that
is,
a
wholly
state
based
wrongful
death
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
i
am
asking
you
is
a
precedent
out
there
you
are
urging
that
we
hold
for
you?
it
would
be,
i
think,
quite
inexplicable
if
we
didn't
say
where
yamaha
stands
in
light
of
the
holding
in
your
favor
if
we
were
to
rule
for
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
case
itself
involved
an
unseaworthiness
claim,
not
a
negligence
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
o'donnell,
i
hope
that
you
will
complete
the
answer
to
my
question
which
i
think
you
hadn't
yet
answered.
i
didn't
think
your
answer
was
as
clear
as
the
one
justice
breyer
gave
you
which
was...
yeah,
you
have,
your
argument
is
now
that
we
take
away
the
limitations
that
moragne
is
just
unseaworthiness;
it
applies
to
negligence
as
well;
then
we
have
yamaha
which
means
that
anyone
in
the
situation
of
mr.
garris
or
his
survivors
has
a
choice
between
the
state
remedy
or
the
federal
remedy.
it's
not
one
or
the
other.
that's
what
justice
breyer
said
was
your
answer,
but
i'm
not
sure
it
was.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
yamaha
said
if,
assuming
there
were
a
federal
claim,
would
that
preclude
a
state
claim,
and
the
answer
was
no,
it
wouldn't.
but
that's
why
i
was
surprised
at
your
answer
is
that,
well,
maybe
it
would.
