justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
ferrini,
the
question
which
we
granted
certiorari,
i
thought,
was
whether
a
general
maritime
law
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
death
in
negligence
exists
or
should
exist.
in
other
words,
whether
moragne
should
extend
to
wrongful
death
action
based
on
negligence,
and
i
didn't...
have
you
raised
below
the
question
of
even
if
it
does...
even
if
the
answer
is
yes,
it
should,
it
shouldn't
apply
here
because
these
are
all
land
based
actors.
i
mean,
i
would
have
thought
that
would
be
a
logical
defense
to
raise,
but
i
don't
see
that
as
part
of
the
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
suppose
i
say
yes,
moragne
extends
to
wrongful
death
based
on
negligence,
but
does
it
extend
to
totally
land
based
action
like
this?
you
didn't
raise
that
apparently.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
answer
my
question.
suppose
i
say
yes,
moragne,
sure
it
extends
to
that.
we've
been
saying
that
all
along
in
dicta,
at
least.
suppose
i
say
yes.
is
that
open
then
to
make
your
argument
that
whatever
moragne
extends
to,
it
doesn't
apply
to
totally
land
based
actors
like
these?
is
that
open?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
just
didn't
think
you
raised
that
here.
i
mean...
and
we
ended
up
with
this
very
limited
question
about
whether
moragne,
to
the
extend
it
applies
at
all,
extends
to
wrongful
death
actions
based
on
negligence.
but
these
other
questions
i
didn't
think
were
presented
to
us.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
just
seems
to
me
that
the
language
in
moragne
itself
points
in
the
direction
of
extending
liability
to
negligence
if
it
can
be
characterized
as
a
violation
of
a
maritime
duty.
but
where
our
court
has
never
really
spoken
to
the
question
is
whether
that
kind
of
liability
extends
beyond
the
owners
of
the
vessels
to
people
who
are
land
based,
and
i
think
that's
where
there
is
more
of
a
question,
although
it
certainly
wasn't
raised
here
very
clearly.
if
it
were
a
vessel
owner
who
was
the
defendant
here,
would
you
take
the
same
position
that
you're
taking
today?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
employer
was
a
land
based
contractor
who
did
work
on
ships
at
dock
to
repair
them.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
not
a
vessel
owner.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
we
have...
we
have
talked
in
terms
of
general
maritime
duties,
i
guess,
which
could
include
negligence,
a
duty
not
to
be
negligent.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i'm
not
sure
that
it
extends
to
all
land
based
actors.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
o'donnell,
didn't
robins,
which
you
rely
on,
go
on
to
say
that
if
it
is
a
maritime
suit
here,
then
it
could
not
be
enlarged
or
impaired
by
state
statute
or
state
law?
it
indicated
that
was
it.
then
you
just
look
to
the
maritime.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
addition
to.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
a
vessel
owner.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
is
the
state
bar?
explain
it.
what
is
the
state
law
in
virginia?
