mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i
would
like
to
first
address
one
of
the
points
that
mr.
ferrini
just
raised,
and
that
justice
o'connor
asked
about,
and
that
was
whether
this
new
sub
species
of
maritime
negligence
law
which
has
been
dubbed
vessel
negligence
was
raised
below.
in
fact
it
was
not;
it
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
reply
brief,
and
we
believe
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
not
to,
for
this
court
to
adopt
yet
another
difficult
distinction
within
the
very
complex
law
of
maritime
law.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
well--
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
--well,
we
would
not
contend...
we
would
not
agree
with
the
characterization
that...
it
is
true
that
mr.
garris
did
not
live
aboard
the
ship.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
he
was
a
ship
repair
worker.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
that
is
correct.
and...
but
the
argument--
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
he--
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
--no.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
the
defendant
was
a
subcontractor
to
norshipco
that
was
hired
to
sandblast
the
hulls
inside
the
vessel,
and
mr.
garris
was
asked
to
assist
in
that
effort.
and
in
doing
so,
he
was
asked
to
climb
up
to
some
scaffolding
whereupon
he
was
knocked
off,
fell,
and
died
aboard
the
ship.
but
the
argument
that
it
was
mere
happenstance
that
he
died
aboard
the
ship
i
think
ignores
the
very
reason
he
was
aboard
the
ship.
it
wasn't
as
in
kermarec.
kermarec,
they
had
a
social
visitor
aboard
the
ship.
mr.
ferrini
acknowledges
that's
maritime
in
nature.
it's
hard
to
imagine
a
more
maritime
activity
than
what
mr.
garris
himself
was
engaged
in.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
yes,
sir.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
no.
we
did
not
have
a...
we
did
not
believe
we
had
a
negligence
claim
against
the
vessel
owner,
as
the
enterprise
was
being
controlled
by
norshipco.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
it
is.
i
would
say
it
is
very
close,
however,
to
the
robins
dry
dock
case
in
which
the
lawsuit
there
was
not
against
the
shipowner
but
against
the
shipyard,
and
that
was
also
a
negligence
case
and
achieved
the
same
result.
in
other
words,
there
the
court
refused
to
apply
the
state
law
in
deference
to
the
federal
law
in
general
maritime,
and
it
did
so,
we
contend,
out
of
uniformity
concerns.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
i
read
kermarec
as
suggesting
that
the
law
was
different;
in
fact,
that
there
was
a
contributory
negligence
law
under
the
state
statute
in
that
under
maritime
law,
comparative
negligence
would
apply.
and
also
kermarec
had
another
issue
in
that--
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
--i
think
that's
moragne,
your
honor.
kermarec
actually
dealt
with
negligence
precisely.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
kermarec--
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
--that
in
kermarec
the
law
regarding
comparative
negligence
would
be
the
rule
rather
than
state
contrib...
contributory
negligence
rule,
and
also
that
the
state
rules
regarding
different
duties
owed
to
invitees,
licensees
and
the
other
classifications
would
not
apply
in
maritime
law
because
maritime
law
had
rejected
those
types
of
distinctions
in
favor
of
a
uniform
reasonable
care
under
the
circumstances
test.
so
that
in
that
case
i
would
disagree.
i
would
think
that
kermarec
can
be
read
and
should
be
read
as
a
vindication
of
maritime
uniformity
principles
in
almost
all
respects.
it
does
involve
an
injury;
it
is
distinguishable
only
because
it's
an
injury
case,
but
i
would
submit
that
that
distinction
is
not
a
distinction
that
the
court
should
maintain.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
correct.
there
would
be
no
duty
of
seaworthiness
owed
to
a--
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
--social
visitor
is
what
the
court
described
him
as.
the
injury/death
distinction
as
justice
stevens
correctly
points
out
is
historical,
but
it
is
historical
only
because
it
derived
out
of
the
harrisburg.
prior
to
the
harrisburg,
and
if
the
harrisburg
itself
records
those
prior
decisions,
and
there
are
some
that
say
there
is
no
wrongful
death,
but
on
balance
the
clear
majority
of
the
opinions
that
the
harrisburg
reviews
finds
a
negligence
based
maritime
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
death,
and
we
would
submit
that
once
the
harrisburg
was
overturned
in
moragne,
the
entire
historical
underpinnings
of
that
distinction,
which
we
submit
was
not
a
good
distinction
to
begin
with,
but
even
the
historical
basis
for
it
was
a
ruse,
and
so
now
that
distinction
is
floating
in
air.
there
is
no
historical
or
logical--
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
--absolutely,
and
the
court--
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
--well,
i...
i
would
agree.
i
don't
think
it
may
extend
to
all
land
based
actors
but,
in
this
instance,
mr.
garris
was
involved
in
a
very
fundamental
aspect
of
maritime
activity,
and
that
is
the
repairing
of
vessels...
the
unseaworthy--
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
--yes.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
i
would
submit
not.
he
was
involved
in
the
same
activity,
and
he
was
injured
in
that
activity,
and
the
court
recognized
he
had
a
general
maritime
cause
of
action
for
negligence.
so
we
do
rely
on
robins,
and
the
only
distinction
i
can
find
in
that
is
that
it
was
an
injury
versus
a
death
case.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
i
think
what
exists
under
a
view
that
moragne
does
not
extend
to
negligence
based
wrongful
death
is
a
gap
in
the
federal
remedy
scheme
in
which
the
maritime
duty
to
not
negligently
kill
someone
has
no
corresponding
federal
maritime
remedy
unless
moragne
is
interpreted
as
extending
such
a
remedy.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
well,
it's
a
gap
in
that
the
federal
law
does
not
permit
it,
but
in
this
instance
and
in
other
instances,
what
it
will
mean
is
that
state
law,
state
law
which
incorporate
principles
which
are
directly
contrary
to
federal
maritime
principles
would
govern,
and
they
would
deny
the
remedy,
and
we
would
submit
that
in
that
instance--
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
--well,
for
instance
in
virginia,
the
virginia
statutory
employer
statute
says
that
in
these
circumstances,
norshipco
would
be
immune
from
suit
whereas
the
federal
statutory
employer
statute
would
reach
the
exact
opposite
result.
in
addition,
you
have
the
state
of
virginia
having
a
contributory
negligence
bar--
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
--that's
correct.
and
he
was
not
employed
by
norshipco;
he
was
employed
by
a
subcontractor.
but
under
federal
law,
unless
norshipco
actually
paid
the
benefits,
they
do
not
receive
statutory--
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
--well,
we
would
submit
that
first
of
all
there's
a
presumption
that
where
federal
maritime
jurisdiction
exists,
federal
maritime
law
ought
to
apply.
we
would
also
submit
that
in
this
very
instance,
the
robins
case
would
hold
that
maritime
law
ought
to
apply.
we
would
also
say
that
the
need
for
uniformity
in
the
administration
of
maritime
law
counsels
in
favor
of
applying
the
federal
standards.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
well,
if
this
court
recognizes
a
moragne
negligence
based
wrongful
death
action,
i'm
not
sure
that's
entirely
true.
i
think
what
would
happen
in
those
instances...
and
what
we
are
asking
for
is
just
that...
we
are
not,
as
mr.
ferrini
suggested,
arguing
that
all
state
law
should
be
preempted
within
state
territorial
waters.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
well,
perhaps
with
regard
to...
to
simply
deciding
the
beneficiaries,
but
not
the
liability.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
not
in
ultimately
giving
out
the
remedies.
that's
true.
but
the
fundamental
liability
standards,
we
submit,
must
be
governed
by
federal
maritime
law
to
preserve
uniformity,
and
for
that
reason
we
think
that
applying
the
state
standard
would
get
the
court
right,
and
the
lower
courts,
right
back
into
the
tungus
mess,
whereas
the
court
is,
the
lower
courts
now
have
to
analyze
every
aspect
of
the
state
law
in
order
to
determine
which
it
would
apply.
i
know,
the
tungus
would
say
you
apply
everything
at
whole,
but
on
remand
in
the
yamaha
case,
the
third
circuit
said
we're
not
going
to...
i
don't
think
they
overruled
the
tungus,
but
they
suggested
another
course
of
activity
was
to
apply
the
federal
liability
standards,
and
that
same
course
was
filed
in
the
amtrak--
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
--we
are...
that
is
not
our
fight,
your
honor.
we
are
asking
for
the
moragne...
we
are
not
saying
that
if
you
adopt
the
moragne,
you
necessarily
preempt
state--
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
--we
don't
think
a
ruling
recognizing
a
moragne
negligence
based
cause
of
action
would
infringe
on
yamaha.
yamaha--
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
--yes,
your
honor.
the
maritime
action
itself...
what
i
thought
i
was
being
asked
by
justice
ginsburg
was
whether
or
not
that
precluded
the
application
of
state
wrongful
death
statutes.
i
would
submit
that--
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
--in
addition
to.
the
court
in
yamaha
used
the
term
seafarer
to
describe
those
individuals
who
may
not
have
access
to
state
wrongful
death
statutes.
it's
unclear
from
my
reading
of
yamaha
just
who
is
and
who
isn't
a
seafarer.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
well,
my
response
comes
back
to
the
activity
that
he
was
involved
in,
and
it
not
being
a
purely
local--
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
--well,
he
used
the
example
where
someone
other
than
a
ship...
a
crew
member
drops
the
banana
peel,
and
that
would
not
be
a
maritime
matter.
here
your
honor
has
mentioned
unseaworthiness,
and
vessel
maintenance,
vessel
repair
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
what
i--
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
--we--
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
--we
contend
that
moragne,
when
it
referenced
maritime
duties
in
the
plural,
it
meant
to
incorporate
and
encompass
negligence
based
wrongful
death
actions.
and
we
think--
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
--absolutely,
justice
ginsburg.
it
dealt
with
an
unseaworthiness
claim.
that
is
correct.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
and
a
vessel
owner.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
and
i'll
keep
coming
back
to
the
robins
dry
dock
where
again
that
distinction
was
not
made.
the
vessel...
a
special
subcategory
called
vessel
negligence
was
not
relied
on.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
well,
i'm
not
arguing
that
if
you
recognize
a
negligence
based
moragne
cause
of
action,
you
have
swept
the
field
of
state
wrongful
death
statutes.
that
is
not
our
position.
our
position
is
the
elements
of
uniformity
and
to
fill
this...
the
fact
that
there
is
a
federal
duty
with
no
corresponding
remedy,
those
issues
counsel
in
favor
of
recognizing
a
moragne
negligence
action,
but
it
doesn't.
we
are
not
arguing
here
preemption.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
well,
i'm
not
sure
where
your
worry
springs
from.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
no,
your
honor.
but
the
state
law
may
continue
to
apply.
what
you've
done
by
creating
the
moragne
cause
of
action
is
you've
gotten
rid
of
that
problem
that
the
lower
courts
had
to
deal
with
in
which
they
were
trying
to
determine
what
aspects
of
state
law
they
could
apply,
and
which
were
violative
of
federal
maritime
principles.
i
think
you've
actually
cleaned
up
a
problem
as
opposed
to
creating
a
new
one.
i
don't
see
the
answer
to
our
request
being
incompatible
with
the
continuation
of
state
wrongful
death
statutes
in
territorial
waters.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
no.
our
state
wrongful
death
action
would
have
been
met
with
the
application
of
the
virginia
statutory
employer
bar.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
no,
there
are
two
separate
statutory
employer
bars...
the
virginia
and
then
the
longshoremen.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
and
if
we...
and
the
fourth
circuit
in
alumax
decided
that
if
you're
bringing
your
action
under
the
state
wrongful
death
statute,
then
the
state
statutory
employer
bar
applies,
and
you
are...
and
we
would
have
been
out
of
court.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
why
would
it
apply
in
the
federal
case?
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
because
that,
unlike
the
longshoremen
harbor
worker
bar,
the...
norshipco...
there's
no
prohibition
on
norshipco
using
that
bar
even
though
it
didn't
actually
pay
any
benefits.
it
says
if
you're
in
the--
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
--yes.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
no.
the
virginia
act
has
no...
has
no
corresponding
limit
that
limits
it
because
you
paid
the
benefits.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
they
were
paid
under
a
federal
act.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
no,
because
the
virginia
bar
would
apply
whether
or
not
he
received
funeral
benefits
under
the
federal
act.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
that
would
not...
that's...
i
believe
that's
irrelevant
to
the
application
of
the
state
bar.
it's
only
relevant
to
the
application
of
the
longshoremen
harbor
worker
act
bar.
in
other
words,
if
you...
if
you
actually
pay
the
benefits
under
the
longshoremen
bar,
you
receive
the
immunity.
under
the
state
there's
no
similar
limitation.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
if
you
are
the...
if
you're
in
the
status
of
prime
contractor
and
your
subcontractor
has
employees
who
are
injured,
you
are
considered
their
statutory
employer
under
virginia
law.
it's
much...
there's
no
exception
to
it
as
there
is
under--
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
--where
i'm
having
trouble,
justice
kennedy,
is
that--
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
--what
i'm...
what
i'm...
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
payment...
let's
assume
there
was
no
payments
made
to
anyone.
norshipco
would
still
have
in
the
state
wrongful
death
action...
they
fall
under
the
definition
of
statutory
employer
and
would
therefore
be
able
to
claim
that
defense.
the
fact
that
they
were
paid
under
the
federal
statute
doesn't
affect
that
defense
in
state
law,
in
the
state
wrongful
death
action.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
well,
it's...
i
would
concede
it's
a
confusing
area.
i
don't
know
if
there
is
any
case
that...
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
robins,
i
don't
read
robins
as
preempting
state
wrongful
death
statutes
generally.
there
is
language
in
there
about
where
state
law
contradicts
some
fundamental
feature
of
admiralty
law,
and
so
there
is
some
of
that.
but
i
don't
think
the
court
went
on...
the
court
concluded
the
federal
maritime
law
cause
of
action
was
to
be
the
action
because
federal
maritime
jurisdiction
existed.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
yes,
yes.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
yes,
and
that's
why
the
court
discussed
the
difference
between
the
two
laws.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
well,
in
the
amtrak
train
crash
litigation,
the
court
goes
through
an
analysis
in
which
it
looks
at
the
federal...
the
aspects
and
characteristics
of
the
state
wrongful
death
statute
and
concludes
that
because
there's
maritime
jurisdiction,
those
rules
cannot
apply
because
they're
directly
contrary--
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
--yeah,
it's
a
conflict
case.
mr.
patrick
h.
o'donnell
i'm
not
aware
of
anything
except...
and
as
justice
ginsburg
points
out,
yamaha
did
not
precisely
deal
with
this
issue
of
negligence,
but
in
yamaha,
i
don't
read
any
suggestion
that
the
existence
of
the
moragne
cause
of
action
somehow...
the
existence...
the
court
seems
to
assume
