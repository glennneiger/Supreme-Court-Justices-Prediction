paul
stevens
well,
isn't
your
answer
historical?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
ferrini,
can
i
ask
you
just
what
your
response
is
to
one
of
the
arguments
made
in
the
concurring
opinion
below,
namely
that
it
would
not
have
been
necessary
to
overrule
harrisburg
unless
it
was
decided
to
recognize
a
cause
of
action
for
negligence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
was
just
a
negligence
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
wasn't
the
harrisburg
just
a
negligence
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it
was
negligence
as
opposed
to
seaworthiness.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
could
have
been
distinguished.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
could
have
been
distinguished
as
judge
hall
pointed
out
by
saying
that
that's
limited
to,
this
is
not
a
negligence
case,
therefore
the
harrisburg
is
not
squarely
on
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
kermarec...
negligence
under
federal
admiralty
law
was
not
discussed,
i
take
it,
because
there
was
apparently
parallel
to
the
state
negligence
law
which
was
adequate?
is
that
the
way
you
read
kermarec?
