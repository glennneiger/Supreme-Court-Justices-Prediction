justice
david
h.
souter
but
regardless
of
whether
it's
a
matter
of
uniformity
or
not,
if
the
federal
maritime
law
covers
it
in
the
case
of
injury,
what
is
the
justification
for
a
separate
regime
in
the
case
of
death?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
i
think
you...
i
think
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
answer
to
several
questions,
but
going
back
to
the
chief
justice's
question
about
kermarec,
i
understood
you
to
assume
that
yes,
there
is
a
general
maritime
cause
of
action
for
negligence.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
understood
you
to
have
said
later
on
in
the
argument
that
if
this
individual
had
merely
been
injured
but
had
not
been
killed,
that
that
cause
of
action
would
apply.
and
if
that's
the
case,
the
question
for
us
i
think
is
why
should
we
have
a
separate
regime
when
the
negligence
is
efficient
enough
to
cause
his
death?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
was
an
injury
case,
and
i
think
what
we're
driving
at
is
why
should
it
be
a
different
situation?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
before
we
get
to
uniformity,
what
about
irrationality?
if
we're
going
to
recognize
the
cause
of
action
for
the
injured,
why
are
we
not
going
to
recognize
the
cause
of
action
when
death
ensues?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
know.
if
we
had,
we
wouldn't
have
this
case.
the
question
is,
why
shouldn't
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
the
rational
basis
for
distinguishing
the
one
from
the
other?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
we
should
go
back
and
overrule
kermarec.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words
it's
wrong,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it's
clearly
established?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
was
the
case
in
robins
too,
wasn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
cited
robins
a
moment
ago.
is
there
any...
is
there
any...
with
respect
to
the
concept
of
land
based,
is
there
any
distinction
between
robins
and
this?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
go
back
to
robins.
you
pointed
out
in
your
argument
a
second
ago
that
the
court
in
robins
had
made
the
remark
that
negligence
in
the
course
of
this
kind
of
repair
work
is
not
a
matter
of
purely
local
concern,
that
it
was
properly
maritime.
has
there
been
any
litigation...
and
sorry,
and
what
i
further
assume
to
be
the
case
is
that
the
cause
of
action
that
robins
recognized
if
it
were
to
have
a
counterpart,
it
had
a
parallel
in
state
law
because
robins
didn't
say
it
was
a
purely
maritime
issue.
and
so
robins,
as
i
understand
it,
left
state
law
wherever
it
might
be,
and
i
presume
there
would
have
been
a
state
law
negligence
action
as
well.
two
questions,
am
i
right
in
that
assumption
that
there
was
a
state
law
negligence
action
parallel
to
what
we
recognized
in
robins?
and
if
the
answer
is
yes,
can
you
tell
me
whether
there
has
been
any
litigation
in
the
ensuing
sixty
years,
i
guess,
on
the
issue
of
whether
the
state
law
action
may
continue
to
be
recognized
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
there
is
also
a
federal
cause
of
action?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
was
the
only
claim
before
it,
wasn't
it,
in
robins?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
they
said
we
recognize
the
federal
maritime
claim.
now,
is
it
clear
that
there
was
a
parallel
state
law
claim,
and
there
was
some
kind
of
a
state
law
claim
for
negligence
which
could
also
have
been
brought
on
the
same
facts.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
and
any
litigation
subsequent
to
that
as
to
whether
the
state
law
claim
survives
in
whole
or
in
part
the
recognition
in
robins
of
the
maritime
claim.
justice
david
h.
souter
conflict
case,
then.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
in
a
non
conflict
situation,
in
other
words,
a
kind
of
field
preemption
situation,
you
know,
in
a
common
law
context,
any
litigation
on
that?
