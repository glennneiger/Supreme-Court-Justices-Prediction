chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
now
argument
next
in
00-346,
norfolk
shipbuilding
&
drydock
corporation
v.
garris.
mr.
ferrini.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ferrini,
how
does
your
case
differ
from
the
kermarec
case,
the
one
this
court
decided
in
1959?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
was...
that
case
did
recognize,
didn't
it,
a
claim
for
negligence
under
general
maritime
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
moragne
dealt
with...
by
its
terms
at
any
rate...
with
unseaworthiness,
and
the
question
you've
presented
here
is
whether
moragne
is
a
basis
for
also
extending
that
doctrine
to
negligence
as
well
as
unseaworthiness,
and
yet
in
kermarec
it
seems
that
we've
already
recognized
a
general
maritime
claim
for
negligence.
you
feel
this
is
different?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
ferrini.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
o'donnell,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
the
same
thing
that
justice
o'connor
inquired
of
your
opponent
about
there
being
all
land
based
actors
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
those
two
different
things,
or
is
it
basically
a
rephrasing
of
the
same
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
was
a
longshoreman,
wasn't
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
ship
repair
worker
who
did
not
live
on
the
ship.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
kermarec,
kermarec
sued
the
vessel
owner.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
here
you
did
not
sue
the
vessel
owner.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
case
is
therefore
distinct
in,
factually
anyway,
from
kermarec.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--new
york.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
court,
as
i
understand
in
kermarec,
the
court
there
said
that
because
the
guy
was
a
visitor,
there
was
no
duty
of
seaworthiness
owed
to
him.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
casual
visitor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
gap,
that
just
means
a
situation
unfavorable
to
the
plaintiff
in
your
view,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
they're
directly
contrary.
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
state
of
virginia
law
grants
more
immunity
to
employers...
what,
subcontractors...
than
the
federal
law
does?
because
certainly
a
longshoreman
can't
sue
his
employer
under
the
federal--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--okay,
so
you
have
two
different
systems,
and
you
know,
if
you're
out
at
sea
there's
no
doubt
the
maritime
law.
but
why
when
you've
got
a
situation
that's
all
land
based
actors,
why
shouldn't
the
state
system
prevail?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
get
to
a
point,
certainly,
where
you
have
to
pick
up
some
parts
of
the
various
state
regimes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you're
going
to
get
a
wrongful
death
cause
of
action,
you're
going
to
have
to
turn
to
state
law
to
decide
who
the
beneficiaries
are,
are
you
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
you
say
simply
deciding.
you
couldn't
proceed
without
some
scheme
for
deciding
who
the
beneficiaries
are,
could
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
o'donnell.
the
case
is
submitted.
