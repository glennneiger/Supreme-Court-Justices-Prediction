justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
it
result
oriented
to
have
symmetry
in
the
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
the
court...
is
the
court
wrong
under
uniformity
to
have
federal
admiralty
law
with
reference
to
injuries?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
thought
kermarec
was
an
unseaworthiness
case,
and
that
this
court
did
not
address
whether
there
was
a
federal
admiralty
cause
of
action
based
on
negligence.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there
was
negligence
under
new
jersey
law--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'll
read
it
again.
you...
what
was
the
holding
of
kermarec--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--with
reference...
kermarec
with
reference
to
federal
admiralty
law
of
negligence
in
a
wrongful
death
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
was
the
reason
why
there
was
no
state
law
avenue
of
recovery
here?
because
of
the
longshore
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
being
the
exclusive
remedy
by
reason
of
virginia
law,
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
did
the
statutory
employer
bar
in
turn
depend
on
the
longshore
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
coverage,
or
some
other--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
did
the
employer...
the
state
employer
bar
apply
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yeah.
why
was
the
employer
entitled
to
invoke
the
bar
under
virginia
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
were
the
benefits
paid
under
the
longshore
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
there
is,
then,
a
federal
act
which
basically
ultimately
is
the
reason
for
there
being
no
liability
here.
there
is
a
virginia
state
bar,
but
the
virginia
state
bar
depends
upon
payment
of
premiums
by
the
subsidiary
corporation
under
the
longshore
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
paid
the
benefits
under
a
federal
act,
or
am
i
wrong?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so
ultimately
it
is
a
federal
act
that
is
the
reason
you
have
a
bar.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'll
think
about
it.
i
still
think
ultimately...
i'm
trying
to
help
you.
i
think
that
ultimately
there's...
it's,
ultimately
it's
the
existence
of
the
longshore
harbor
workers'
compensation
act,
and
the
benefits
payments
that
were
made
by
the
subsidiary,
that
invokes
the
bar,
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
because
your
subsidiary
paid
benefits
under
the...
and
is
covered
by
the
federal...
by
the
longshore
harbor
workers'
compensation
act,
you
are
entitled
to
invoke
the
state
bar.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
may
be
having
trouble
because
i'm
wrong,
but
i...
i
don't
know...
i
don't
know
what
it
is
that
the
subsidiary
employer
did
that
it
operated
to
allow
the
parent
to
invoke
the
state
bar,
if
it
were
not
payment
of
longshore
harbor
workers'
compensation
benefits.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
thank
you.
