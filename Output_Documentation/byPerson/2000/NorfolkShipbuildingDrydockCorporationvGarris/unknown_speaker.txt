mr.
ferrini,
you're
trying
to
make
now
something
special
about
ships
and
their
navigation,
and
in
part
that's
true,
but
let's
just
take
your...
a
slip
and
fall
on
a
deck
on
a
banana
peel.

now
the
field
is
so
occupied
by
statutes...
state
wrongful
death
statutes,
dohsa
for
death
on
the
high
seas...
that
the
court
ought
to
stay
out
of
it
and
leave
it
all
to
legislation.
