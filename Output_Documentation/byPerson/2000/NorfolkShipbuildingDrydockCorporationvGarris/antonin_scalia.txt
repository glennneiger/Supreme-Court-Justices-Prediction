justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
agree
with
moragne,
basically.
i
mean,
if...
if
you're
saying
what
you're
saying
here
about
uniformity,
you
probably
don't
agree
with
moragne.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
do
agree
with
moragne?
well,
i
really
can't
say
why,
having
decided
moragne,
we
want
to
draw
the
line
between...
if
indeed
we
didn't
already
cross
that
bridge
in
moragne...
i
don't
know
why
we
would
want
to
draw
a
distinction
between
injury
and
death.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
two
cases:
the
first
is
number
00-346,
norfolk
shipbuilding
and
drydock
corporation
against
garris.
in
this
case
the
respondent’s
son
christopher
garris
was
killed,
as
a
result
of
injuries
he
suffered
while
working
on
board,
the
ship
maj.
stephen
w.
pless.
since
the
ship
was
berthed
in
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
at
time
he
was
injured,
she
filed
complaints
in
the
district
court
under
federal
admiralty
jurisdiction.
she
said
the
negligence
of
the
petitioner,
the
drydock
company
and
another
party
had
caused
her
son’s
death
and
she
asked
for
damages
under
general
maritime
law
which
is
law
made
by
judges
on
the
exercise
of
their
admiralty
powers.
the
district
court
dismissed
her
complaint.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
reversed
saying
that
“although
this
court
had
not
yet
recognized
a
maritime
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
death
resulting
from
negligence.”
the
principles
contained
in
our
decision
in
moragne
versus
states
marine
lines,
a
decision
about
some
30
years
ago,
made
such
an
action
appropriate.
we
agree.
in
moragne,
we
held
that
the
general
maritime
law
provides
a
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
death
caused
by
breach
of
duty
of
unseaworthiness.
unseaworthiness
was
the
limit
of
our
holding
there
but
we
cannot
find
any
basis
for
distinguishing
negligence
from
unseaworthiness.
negligence
is
no
less
a
“distinctive
maritime
dury
than
seaworthiness”.
as
we
explained
in
an
opinion
authored
by
justice
scalia
and
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
the
common
law
duties
of
care
have
not
been
adopted
and
retained
unmodified
by
admiralty
but
have
been
adjusted
to
fit
their
maritime
context.
we
do
not
agree
with
the
petitioner
that
congress
has
preempted
this
cause
of
action
by
statute
though
if
it
had
of
course
we
would
be
obliged
to
enforce
the
statute.
none
of
the
three
statutes
which
are
talked
about
by
petitioner,
the
jones
act,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
or
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
a
preempt
this
cause
of
action.
beyond
preemption
is
a
prudential
matter
or
probably
be
the
better
course
in
many
cases
that
assert
new
claims
of
maritime
personal
injury
law
to
leave
further
development
to
congress
which
is
already
legislated
so
extensively
in
the
area.
but
the
cause
of
action
we
recognize
today
is
new
only
in
the
most
technical
sense
of
a
word.
the
general
maritime
law
has
recognized
the
tort
of
negligence
for
more
than
a
century
and
it
has
been
clear
since
our
moragne
decision
that
breaches
of
a
maritime
duty
are
actionable
when
they
cause
death,
as
when
they
cause
injury.
we
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
in
which
justice
souter
and
justice
breyer
have
joined.
