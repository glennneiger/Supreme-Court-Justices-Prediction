mr.
james
t.
ferrini
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court--
this
is
a
decidedly
local
tort
action
which
defendant
respectfully
submits
does
not
invoke
a
federal
uniformity
interest;
certainly
it
does
not
invoke
a
need
for
such
interest
so
compelling
as
to
require
this
court
to
create
or
infer
a
wrongful
death
cause
of
action
based
on
general
negligence
under
circumstances
where
there
is
no
claim
of
vessel
liability.
what
this
case
is
not
is
a
case
which
would
involve
any
concept
endemic
to
or
originating
in
or
peculiar
to
the
sea.
we
are
not
concerned
about
seamen's
responses;
we
are
not
concerned
about
unseaworthiness
or
any
form
of
vessel
liability.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
in
kermarec,
your
honor,
which
involved
negligence,
the
negligence
was
negligence
in
the
operation
of
a
vessel,
either
with
it
navigating
or
the
manner
in
which
it
was
operated,
but
nothing
like
our
case
where
we
have
a
local
enterprise
that
was
operating
a
crane
that
was
located
on
a
pier
over
a--
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
--your
honor,
i
believe
it
did,
but
again,
that
was
a
case
of
a
visitor
on
a
vessel,
and
the
captain
of
the
vessel
had
an
obligation
to
make
sure
that
the
stairway
was
in
good
condition,
etcetera,
but
there
you're
dealing
with
a
concept
which
i
think
to
be
very
akin
to
that
in
moragne.
what
we're
dealing
with
there
is
a
concept
of
the
manner
in
which
a
vessel
is
operated,
a
vessel
is
maintained
for
the
safety
of
people
on
it,
and
that
is
the
kind
of
concept
which
requires
uniform
treatment.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
your
honor,
i
think
what
we
have
to
do
is
look
at
the
concept
of
uniformity
in
the
context
of
article
3,
section
2
in
the
federalist
papers,
and
think
in
terms
of
why
is
it
that
this
particular
body
of
law,
as
of
all
bodies
of
law
there
are...
this
substantive
body
of
admiralty
is
given
to
this
court
and
to
congress,
and
the
purpose
is
so
that
the
nation
speaks
with
one
voice
under
circumstances
where
there
can
be
an
impact
on
our
relationship
with
our
partners
in
trade.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
the
way
they
are--
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
--your
fourth
circuit,
your
honor,
quite
frankly,
the
focus
of
the
court
and
the
parties
was
upon
what
does
moragne
create
rather
than
should
it
create
an
exception.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
i
think
it's
certainly
open,
your
honor,
because
when
we...
when
you
made
your
decision
in
moragne,
the
idea
was
not
just
is
there
a
general
cause
of
action
for
all
circumstances
for
wrongful
death?
no,
the
focus
was
on
unseaworthiness
and
on
maritime
duties.
and
by
the
same
token,
if
you're
going
to
here
decide
if
there
is
a
wrongful
death
action
created
under
the
moragne
rationale,
if
that
much
of
moragne
is
even
left
existent,
certainly
i
think
this
court
has
the
jurisdiction
to
determine
under
what
circumstances,
and
just
as--
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
--your
honor,
with
all
due
respect,
i
view
our
question
as
having
been
raised
as
whether
there
is
a
wrongful
death
cause
of
action
under
the
circumstances
with
which
the
court
is
presented.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
if
he
were
on
the
vessel
at
the
time,
as
he
was,
yes,
he
would.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
he
would.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
in
that
respect
i
am,
your
honor,
because
this
court
has
created
a
general
maritime
body
of
law
dealing
with
injury.
there
is
no
two
ways
about
that.
but
the
result
would
be
different
because
that...
the
fact
that
the
state
law
does
not
give
the
same
remedy
that
that
general
body
of
law
gives
is
not
an
objective
of
uniformity.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
well,
maritime
law
has
been
described
as
one
of
the
most
complex
areas,
and
it
certainly
is
a
patchwork,
and
that
is
the
historical
consequence
of
the
way
things
developed.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
well,
i
respectfully
submit
that
to
create
a
monistic
single
area
of
law
covering
both
death
and
injury,
the
first
thing
this
court
would
have
to
do
is
overrule
the
tungus.
it
would
have
to
overrule--
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
--yes,
this
court
did
not
decide,
however.
in
footnote
7
we
said...
this
court
said
we
are
not
deciding
that
there
is
such
a
cause
of
action,
but
i
take
it
a
step
further.
what
this
court,
i
believe,
was
assuming
was
the
existence
of
a
cause
of
action
against
the
manufacturer
of
a
vessel,
because
that
is
what
a
jet
ski
has
been
determined
to
be.
and
it
comes
back
to
my
same
concept
of
what
is
the
purpose
of
uniformity?
and
i
don't
think
the
purpose
of
uniformity
is
that
all
remedies
be
the
same
in
all
circumstances,
because
that's
exactly
what
your
honor
said
was
not
the
objective
of
uniformity
in
the
yamaha
case.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
i
think
it
is
very...
i
think
what
your
honor
is
driving
at
is
the
possibility
of
concurrent
existence
of
a
federal
cause
of
action
and
a
state
cause
of
action.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
and
i
point
out...
i
hasten
to
point
out
that
that
is
the
one
thing
my
opponent
has
not
raised
or
urged,
and
why
is
that?
because
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
consistent
with
uniformity.
if
uniformity...
the
purpose
of
uniformity
is
going
to
be
that
there
is
some
semblance
of
reliability
in
knowing
what
cause
of
action
is
going
to
exist,
once
you
create
a
dual
system,
then
everything
is
up
in
the
air...
your
insurance
questions,
your
rates,
everything
is
up
in
the
air,
because
we
don't
know
in
any
individual
death
what
law
the
plaintiff
is
going
to
invoke.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
i
think
that
that
is...
in
the
case
of
injury,
absolutely.
i
agree
with
that.
there
is
this
existing
body
of
law,
and
i
don't
think,
however
that
that...
that
the
fact
that
that
is
a
solitary
body
of
law
is
a
matter
of
uniformity.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
well,
just--
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
--yes.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
first,
i
would
like
to
correct
an
answer
i
gave
earlier
to
the
chief
justice.
i
forgot...
i
believe
kermarec
was
an
injury
case
and
not
a
death
case,
a
totally
different
situation.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
again,
it
comes
back
to
what
this
court
sees
as
the
purpose
of
uniformity.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
because
this
court
never
has,
death
was
something
that
was
always
left
to
the
states.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
then
i
would
ask--
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
--to
me,
your
honor,
because
that
would
be
result
oriented.
you're
going
the
other
way
then
in
a
situation
where
the
state
law
is
more
favorable--
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
--it's
historical,
and
it's
a
departure
from
the
objective
with
which
this
court
is
granted
the
power
of
uniformity.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
i
think,
to
be
quite
frank,
that
things
developed
beyond
a
clear
view
of
what
the
mission
of
the
court
was.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
not
at
all,
your
honor.
i
do
agree
with
moragne.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
because
this
court
has
recognized
time
and
time
again
that
you
must
treat
everybody
the
same,
no
matter
where
they
are
on
the
sea.
and
when
you're
dealing
with
unseaworthiness,
that
vessel
had
better
be
operational
regardless
of
whether
it's
in
territorial
waters
or
in
the
sea
of
japan
or
next
door,
because
everybody
has...
let's
put
it
this
way,
i
think
uniformity...
the
concept
of
uniformity
is
very
similar
to
the
concept
of
the
diversity
of
citizenship,
which
the
purpose
of
which
is
fair
treatment
of
foreigners.
and
regardless
if
you're
dealing
with
a
seaman
who
gets
in,
in
italy
and
he
comes
over
here
and
he's
injured
over
here,
he
has
to
be
treated
the
same.
but
when
you're
dealing
in
a
case
like
this
with
a
harbor
worker,
and
you're
dealing
with
local
businesses
like
my
client
that's
named
after
norfolk,
and
it's
in
the...
there
would
have
been
no,
talk
about
abnormalities
or,
there
would
be
no
recovery.
we
wouldn't
even
be
here
if
this
particular
crane
had
struck
him
while
he
was
doing
preparatory
work
on
the
dock.
never...
not...
there
is
no
such
thing
as
perfect
symmetry;
you'll
never
reach
that
because--
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
--not
at
all,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
too
far
developed
to
do
that.
i
think
that
there,
the--
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
--general
maritime--
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
--clearly
established.
and
i
think
that's
the
purpose
of
the
talbot
case
my
opponent
relies
on.
he
says,
well--
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
--yes.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
i
am
told...
i
have
no
authority
on
this,
and
i
don't
believe
it's
in
the
record...
i
am
told
what
she
got
was
the
funeral
expenses,
which
is
what
congress
decided
she
should
get
since
there
was
no
dependency.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
i
have
no
idea,
your
honor.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
because
i
think
what
your
honor
is
looking
at
is
the
particular
jurisdiction.
if
this
had
happened
in
new
york
harbor
where
the
law
is
different,
there
would
be
a
substantial
recovery.
but
the
fourth
circuit
got
it
wrong
when
the
fourth
circuit
said
that
it's
happenstance
that
the
man
was
killed
in
norfolk
harbor
rather
than
new
york
harbor.
he
was
in
norfolk
harbor
because
that's
where
he
lived
and
that's
where
he
worked,
and
that's
where
he
died.
and
the
state
should
be
able
to
provide
for
their
interest
in
deciding
the
familial
issues
of
wrongful
death,
who
should
recover,
and
how
much
they
should
recover.
it
should
be
able
to
decide
that
what
a
statutory
employer
will
get
as
a
quid
pro
quo
for
giving
the
benefits.
and
i
would
point
out
there
is
a
very
little
difference
between
the
lhwca
and
the
virginia
wrongful
death
statute.
both
of
them
have
the
concept
of
a
statutory
employer.
both
of
them
have
the
concept
that
that
statutory
employer
is
immune
from
common
law
or
statutory
actions.
the
only
difference
is
that
in
virginia
they
guarantee
the
money
will
be
there
by
saying
if
you
hire
somebody
to
do
the
job,
you
have
to
go
out
and
get
insurance
to
make
sure
that
comp
benefit
is
there,
where
the
federal
statute
says
you
only
have
to
go
out
and
get
that
insurance
if
the
person
you've
hired
hasn't
fulfilled
his
responsibility.
and
that's
kind
of
an
iffy
thing,
because
he
can
show
you
a
certificate
of
insurance
and
it
turns
out
to
be
that
there's
no
coverage
for
one
reason
or
another.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
this
is
a
very
limited
exception...
a
very
limited
case...
where
this
man's
descendants
or
his
widow...
his
mother...
will
have
no
recovery,
but
it's
not
the
ordinary
case.
and
i
don't
think
the
law
can
change
based
upon
the
happenstance
that
we
don't
like
the
result
for
this
particular
plaintiff
because
in
the
next
case
you're
going
to
be
very
happy
with
the
results
for
the
particular
plaintiff.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
well,
i
think
it
is,
because
you
are
then
dealing
with
familial
issues
which
the
state
has
a
strong
interest
in.
who
should
recover
in
the
event
of
death?
what
should
their
relationship
be
to
the
decedent?
what
should
be
the
degree
of
dependency,
if
any?
these
have
always
been
left
to
the
state.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
well,
that's
kind
of
a
pick
and
choose
thing,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
law
has
to
be
consistent...
either
you
apply
state
law
or
you
don't.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
i
can't
comment
on
the
full
area,
but
certainly
the
tungus
case
said
you
take
state
law...
if
you're
taking
state
law,
you
take
state
law
as
it
is
with
the
all
the
parts
of
it.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
i
don't
see
that
as
consistent
with
uniformity
but
again,
your
honor,
what
i
think
the
court
is
doing
is
proposing
to
fashion
a
remedy
to
benefit
an
individual
in
very
limited
circumstances
where
the
bottom
line
is
that
the
state
application
of
state
law,
consistent
with
this
court's
majority
concurring
and
dissenting
opinions
in
american
dredging,
has
no
impact
on
commerce.
i
think
we're
losing
sight
of
the
objective
in
order
to
fashion
a
remedy.
i
think
that...
i
would
suggest
that--
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
--i
do
not
believe
that
everything
this
court
has
developed
in
the
way
of
substantive
law
for
injury
is
necessarily
something
that
is
required
for
uniformity
in
the
sense
of
the
constitutional
basis
of
it,
but
rather
a
symmetry.
and
that's
just
the
way
things
developed,
but
let
me
point
out
in
pope
&
talbot,
my
opponent
points
out
that
in
that
particular
case,
look,
they
refused
to
apply
the
state
contributory
rule
because
there
was
a
federal
rule
of
comparative
negligence.
why?
that
wasn't...
this
court
didn't
say
that
that
was
because
of
uniformity
concerns;
the
court
did
so
saying,
look,
we
have
considered...
we've
already
created
a
body
of
law.
in
that
existing
body
of
law
we
created
certain
rights,
and
those
rights
now
exist.
and
if
a
right
exists
by
virtue
of
a
congressional
action
or
by
a
decision
of
this
court,
a
state
can't
take
it
away.
so
that
body
of
law
is
not
representative
as
a
whole
of
a
need
for
uniformity
in
all
aspects
of
law.
i
respectfully
submit
that
what
i'm
offering
this
court
is
a
predictability,
that
we
look
as
professor
fore
suggests
to
our
national
interests...
that
we
look
as
this
court
suggested
in
american
dredging
to
the
impairment
of
commerce
or
to
the
kamen
court
where
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
looked
to
whether
state
law
had
extraterritorial
effect,
and
if
it
didn't
have
that
kind
of
effect,
then
there
was
no
need
for
preemption.
there
was
no
uniformity
concern.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
my
position
is
if
it's
a
vessel
owner,
i
can
perfectly
understand
adoption
or
creation
of
a
cause
of
action
for
the
sake
of
uniformity.
i
would
point
out
to
your
honor
that
my
opponent's
main
argument
i
view
as
saying
this
court
in
moragne
talked
of
maritime
duties.
what
is
a
maritime
duty?
if
a
man
comes
on
a
vessel
and
pulls
a
gun
on
another
man,
he's
violated
duties
but
not
maritime
duties.
negligence
as
an
abstract
concept
is
not
a
maritime
duty.
the
maritime
duty
i
submit
has
to
do
with
the
manner
in
which
the
vessel
is
operated,
and
this
court
has
never
said
anything
to
the
contrary.
i
point
out
that
kermarec
and
leathers,
the
two
cases
that
are
said
to
refer
to
negligence
as
a
maritime
duty
or
a
breach
of
a
maritime
duty,
they
dealt
with
vessel
liability.
or
the
east
river
case
which
is
stated
by
my
opponent
to
refer
to
products
liability
as
a
breach
of
a
maritime
duty.
that
was
that
the
product
there
was
the
main
propulsion
unit
for
the
vessel.
we
keep
coming
back
to
the
same
thing.
so
that
you
treat
people
the
same
no
matter
where
they
are
on
the
sea.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
well,
i
don't...
i
don't
purport
to
give
you
an
answer
for
every
case
that
will
arise
in
the
future,
but
i
think
that
if
that
banana
peel
was
dropped
by
a
crew
member,
you
could
have
a
breach
of
a
maritime
duty,
but
if
it
was
dropped
by
another
visitor
and
the
crew
had
no
chance
to
clean
it
up,
that
that's
negligence
but
that
is
not
a
breach
of
a
maritime
duty.
i
think
you
keep,
i
keep
coming
back
to
the
concept
of
what
is
it
that
we're
trying
to
achieve?
and
what
we're
trying
to
achieve
is
a
uniform
treatment
of
foreigners
much
like
the
diversity
concept.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
i
think
harrisburg
had
to
be
overruled
in
order
to
recognize
that
it
was
the
harrisburg's--
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
negligent
vessel.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
that's
right.
but
it,
again
it
dealt
with
a
negligent
vessel,
it
did
not
deal
with
general
negligence,
and
the
rule
was
nothing
survives.
after
death,
no
personal
action
survives.
so
that
had
to
be
overruled
or
it
was
impossible
for
moragne
to
exist.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
but
moragne--
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
--not
if
the
court
wanted
to
do
as
it
did
and
broadly
state
we're
talking
about
unseaworthiness
and
breach
of
maritime
duties,
because
the
breach
of
maritime
duty
was
at
issue
in
the
harrisburg,
since
it
was
vessel
liability.
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
i
have
left.
mr.
james
t.
ferrini
thank
you.
