justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
want
to
give
them
both,
in
other
words.
what
do
you
think
about
mr.
ferrini's
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
going
back
to
the
question
that
you
were
discussing
with
the
chief
justice?
his
point
i
think,
if
i
understood
it,
is
that
look,
i
agree...
imagining
he's
making
this
argument...
i
agree
with
you
if
a
seaman
is
involved,
you
need
a
uniform
admiralty
law.
if
the
seaworthiness
of
the
vessel
is
involved,
you
need
a
uniform
admiralty
law.
if
a
sea
owner
is
involved,
you
need
a
uniform
admiralty
law.
but
in
the
absence
of
those
things,
the
word
uniformity
has
no
reason.
and,
moreover,
here
we're
talking
about
a
local
person
in
a
harbor,
local
circumstances,
and
so
local
law
should
prevail.
and
when
you
come
back
and
say,
well,
isn't
that
equally
true
of
injury,
he
says
yes.
but
even
if
we've
decided
the
opposite
in
respect
to
injury,
let's
not
make
matters
worse.
and
here
he
would
say...
i
guess,
or
i
thought
i
heard
him
say...
that
this
particular
wrongful
death
statute
is
more
local
yet,
because
it
is
not
the
injured
person's
personal
statute.
it
belongs
to
the
survivors.
they're
the
ones
who
are
suing,
and
they
are
local
people,
and
that's
unlike
a
personal
injury
action.
and,
indeed,
you
in
fact
have
to
pick
up
state
law
anyway,
i've
heard,
in
order
to
find
out
who
those
survivors
are
who
are
going
to
be
able
to
sue.
so
he
says
this
is
even
more
local
than
the
injury
action
and,
besides,
don't
make
matters
worse.
now,
i'm
trying
to
paraphrase;
i
don't
know
if
i've
got
it
right,
but
if...
i'm
trying
to
make
it
as
strong
as
i
can
in
my
mind.
now
i
want
to
hear
your
response.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
it's
absolutely
on
a
ship.
it's
definitely
an
activity
on
a
ship,
but
so
what?
i
mean,
what's
the
interest
there?
i
mean,
anything
on
a
ship
then
you
win
by
definition,
but
his
point
is,
you
see,
that
just
being
on
a
ship
is
not
enough.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was
really
looking
for
an
answer
in
terms
of
precedent,
or
in
terms
of
what
justice
ginsburg
is
talking
about,
or
whether
or
not
moragne
in
fact
did
involve...
did
it?
a
question
of
personal
injury
for
negligence
as
applied
to
a
longshoreman,
or
did
it?
i'm
really
looking
for
an
answer.
is
he
really
asking
us
to
back
up
too
far,
or
what
is
the
precedent
on
it?
did
moragne
decide
this
question
for
a
longshoreman
as
to
injury?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
say
what
you
want
to
say.
i
want
to
hear
your
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
you're
not
arguing
it,
but
it's
something
i
have
to
worry
about.
to
be
specific,
i
would
worry
if
in
addition
to
all
of
mr.
ferrini's
arguments,
my
deciding
you
are
right
in
this
case
means
i've
wiped
out
all
the
wrongful
death
actions
belonging
to
states
that
somebody
who
was
injured
on
a
ship
might
otherwise
have.
i
would
worry
about
that.
so
i
would
like
you
to
either
get
rid
of
my
worry
or
confirm
my
worry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
springs
from
that
just...
maybe
i
may
not
have
understood
it,
but
i
thought
what
we
were
talking
about
was
the
possibility
that
if
you
have
a
federal
action
in
the
area,
you
no
longer
can
have
the
state
action.
so
maybe
it's
so
far
off
you're
just
going
to
dispose
of
my
worry
in
a
sentence,
so
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
all
right.
there
certainly
would
be
a
claim
in
any
state
that
was
more
generous
than
federal
law
that
there
was
a
conflict,
so
it
looks
like
my
concern...
you
win
your
case
in
this
situation
where
the
laws--
