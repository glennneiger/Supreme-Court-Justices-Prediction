justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
it
says
you
have
to
be
a
prevailing
party,
and
i
think
prevailing
obviously
means
prevailing
in
the
lawsuit,
not...
it
doesn't
say
the
happy
party,
you
know,
the
party
who
goes
away
smiling.
it
says
the
prevailing
party.
i
think
it
means
prevailing
in
the
litigation,
and
to
prevail
in
the
litigation
there
has
to
be
something
that
ties
the
result
to
the
litigation,
it
seems
to
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
--other
than
simply,
it
came
out
the
way
the
plaintiff
would
have
liked.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sure
every
member
of
congress
read
that
case.
they
ran
to
their
library
and
looked
up
that
case.
you
really
think
that
anybody
who
voted
for
that
bill
had
the
slightest
idea
what
that
case
held?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
people
do
you
think
knew
what
that
case
held?
two?
you
think...
i
think
two
would
be
an
extravagant
number.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
they
know
what
the
court
of
appeals
law
is?
they
know
what
the
court
of...
lower
courts
have
been
holding
as
opposed
to
what
this
court
has
held?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
had
no
authority
to
change
the
rules.
it
had
to
be
done
by
the
legislature.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
do
you
think
the
fire
commissioner
changed
his
mind
because
he
was
afraid
of
losing
the
lawsuit,
or
because
he
was
persuaded
that
it
was
a
good
idea?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
prove
that?
is
there
any
possible
way
of
proving
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
that's
the
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
your
lawsuit...
what
if
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
lawsuit.
it
may
be
against
his
agency,
but
he
happens
to
read
about
the
lawsuit
in
the
paper
and
he
says,
this...
what,
this
is
an
outrageous
thing.
you
mean,
that's
what
our
rules
say?
and
then,
motivated
by
your
lawsuit,
okay,
he
does
the
same
thing
you
said
he's
done
here
and
gets
the
rule
changed.
does
that
make
your
case
a
catalyst?
i
guess
it
does,
in
a
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
instead
of
reading
it
in
the
paper.
i
mean,
what
difference
would
that...
i
don't
see
what
difference
it
makes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
my
goodness,
you
don't
become
a
prevailing
party
by
getting
a
preliminary
order
just
leaving
the
status
quo
in
effect
while
the
case
is
being
adjudicated.
i
mean,
is
that
all
it
takes
to
prevail?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
with
you.
i
think
he
was
trying
to
hurt
you.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
then
why
not,
just
reading
about
it
in
the
papers,
the
legislators
read
about
this
lawsuit,
and
but
for
this
lawsuit
they
would
never
have
known
about
this
outrageous
law,
and
that's
enough,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
fire
marshal
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
he
never
ran
to
the
legislature.
they
just
read
about
it
in
the
paper.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
it
would
be
a
different
case,
but
why
would
it
be
different
as
far
as
your
claim
is
concerned?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
causation.
they
would
not
have
known
about
this
thing
except,
because
of
your
lawsuit,
it
gets
in
the
papers.
they
read
about
it,
they
think,
gee,
that's
a
stupid
law,
let's
change
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
brinkmann,
what
if
i
were
a
member
of
the
west
virginia
legislature
and
i
know
this
suit
has
been
pending
for
a
long
time,
and
they
have
hired
very
expensive
lawyers
to
sue
the
state,
there's
a
lot
of
money
involved,
and
i
would
really...
i
think
this
is
a
dumb
law
that's
on
the
books,
and
i
would
really
like
to
change
that
law,
but
then
the
fire
marshal
comes
to
me
and
he
says,
you
know,
if
you
change
that
law,
the
state
is
going
to
be
liable
for
millions
of
dollars
in
attorneys'
fees,
because
it
will
be
held
that
the
suit
was
the
catalyst
for
the
change,
and
we'll
have
to
pay
all
this
money.
why
would
we
want
to
distort
the
legislative
process
in
west
virginia
by
making
a
change
in
the
law
that
the
members
of
the
legislature
think
desirable
costly
because
of
the
existence
of
a
lawsuit,
even
though
the
state
believes
it
can
win
the
lawsuit?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
think
they're
going
to
lose.
they
just
say,
if
we
change
the
law
because
it's
a
bad
law,
we're
going
to
have
to
pay
all
this
money
in
attorneys'
fees.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
to
show,
in
order
to
establish
the
causation
you're
talking
about,
that
the
legislature
made
the
change
because
it
knew
it
would
lose
the
lawsuit?
is
that
a
condition,
you
have
to
show
that
the
legislature
made
the
change
because
it
realized
that
its
law
was
contrary
to
federal
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
ah,
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
they
could
have
changed
it
for
a
reason
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
their...
with
the
lawsuit,
except
that
the
lawsuit
brought
the
matter
to
their
attention,
even
though
they
weren't
worried
about
losing
the
lawsuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
knew
they
could
win
the
lawsuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
that...
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
get
a
settlement
approved
by
the
court,
the
court
will
enforce
that
settlement,
won't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
really
have
to
prevail.
you
have
some
judicial
power
behind
that
contract.
it's
just
a
contract,
but
this
is
one
that
the
court
is
behind.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
the
legislature
just
read
about
it
in
the
newspapers?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
factual
predicate.
that's
how
they
learned
about
it,
and
it
was
not
a
meritless
lawsuit,
and
that's
all
that's
needed?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cleek,
mr.
arceneaux
was
queried
extensively
about
some
of
the
practical
problems
with
his
position.
what
about
the
practical
problems
with
yours?
what
do
you
do
about
the
agency
that
is
really
guilty
as
sin,
and
they're
going
to
lose
this
case.
they
know
they're
going
to
lose
it,
so
after
dancing
the
plaintiff
around
for
several
years,
causing
great
expense
in
attorneys'
fees,
when
the
case
is
about
to
come
up
for
judgment,
they
just
fold,
and
revise
the
regulation
that's
been
under
challenge...
don't
enter
a
settlement,
they
just
revise
the
regulation
that's
under
challenge.
justice
antonin
scalia
attorneys'
fees
payable?
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
no,
it
moots
the
case.
that's
why
they
do
it.
they
do
it
to
moot
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
many
settlements
are
you
aware
of
that
are
not
split-the-difference
settlements?
i
mean,
what
advantage
is
there
to
entering
into
a
settlement
if
you're
coughing
up
everything
that
the
plaintiff
has
asked
for?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
my
experience,
at
least,
when
you
sign
a
settlement
agreement
you
get
something
in
exchange
for
that
settlement
agreement.
if
you're
just
going
to
cut
and
run,
just
cut
and
run
and
save
the
attorneys'
fees
in
drafting
the
settlement
agreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cleek,
i'm
not
a
big
fan
of
attributing
a
house
report
to
the
entire
congress.
i
would
much
rather
look
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
but
isn't
it...
if
you
look
to
the
reports,
isn't
it
possible
that
when
whoever
wrote
it
was
speaking
about
voluntary
cessation
of
the
unlawful
conduct,
he
was
talking
about
voluntary
cessation
of
conduct
acknowledged
to
be
unlawful,
that
there's
a
difference
between
ceasing
it
because
oh,
yeah,
you
got
us,
and
we'll...
you
know,
i
agree
that
this
was
wrong,
and
ceasing
it
because,
my
god,
this
lawsuit
is
going
to
cost
us
another
$2
million,
it
is
simply
not
worth
it?
by
the
way,
i'm
not
sure
whether
that
makes
the
lawsuit
a
catalyst
or
not.
it
probably
does.
you
know,
there's
something
to
the
claim,
but
it's
just
not
worth
fighting
it
for
another
3
years
and
$2
million
in
fees.
let's
throw
in
the
towel,
forget
about
it,
even
though
i
think
what
we're
doing
is
lawful.
i
suppose
that
would
be
a
catalyst.
but
can't
you
read
the
house
reports
as
meaning
voluntary
cessation
of
conduct
acknowledged
to
be
unlawful?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
couldn't
you
respond
to
it
by
saying
that
where
you
have
a
written
settlement
you
don't
have
to
acknowledge
liability
because
the
written
settlement
is
what
ties
it
to
the
litigation?
where
you
don't
have
that
tie
to
litigation,
the
only
thing
that
could
possibly
tie
it
to
the
litigation
is
the
acknowledgement
that
the
litigation
was
correct.
the
acknowledgement,
since
you
don't
have
a
written
settlement,
that,
indeed,
our
action
was
unlawful
and
therefore
we're
going
to
stop
it,
at
least
that
ties
it
to
the
litigation
somehow.
justice
antonin
scalia
whereas
just
stopping
it,
without
any
acknowledgement
that
what
you
were
doing
was
wrong,
you
have
no
idea
whether
the
litigation
was
what
produced
it,
or
whether
the
west
virginia
legislature
just
decided
this
was
a
stupid
law,
which
is
frankly
what
i
think
it
thought.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
lower
court
found
no
entitlement,
why?
i
don't
recall
that.
why
did
the
lower
court
find
no
entitlement?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
not
a
prevailing
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we
found
no
entitlement
because
why?
we
found
it
was
a
prevailing
party,
but
no
entitlement
because
of--
