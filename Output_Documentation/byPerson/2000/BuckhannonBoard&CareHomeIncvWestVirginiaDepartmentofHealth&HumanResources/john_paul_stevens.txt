there
is
a
presumption
that
we
follow
that
the
congresspeople
know
what
the
law
is,
isn't
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
said
that
in
some
of
our
opinions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
cannon,
for
example.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
marr
case
was
a
supreme
court
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
isn't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--why
isn't...
each
case
why
isn't
there
a
causal
relationship?
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
i
think
he's
trying
to
help
you,
in
other
words.
i
don't
think
you
realize
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
this
such
a
case?
you're
in
such
a
case.
isn't
this
an
example
of
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
state
totally
abandoned
its
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you,
mr.
cleek?
let's
assume
there's
a
special
problem
when
you
have
to
prove
it
through
a
legislature,
but
as
i
understand
your
position,
you
would
take
precisely
the
same
position
if
the
fire
marshal
had
had
the
authority
on
his
own
to
change
the
regulation
and
just
not
say
anything
about
it.
you'd
still
say
there's
no
entitlement
to
fees.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
it
is
not
important
for
us
to
decide
whether
the
legislature
has
to
be
involved,
because
your
theory
doesn't
really
depend
on
legislative
action.
it
just
happens
to
be
what
is
true
of
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand
your
position.
i'm
just
suggesting
your
position
really
doesn't
require
a
legislature
to
be
involved
in
order
to
have
a
valid
objection
to
the
fees,
but
i
don't
really
get,
except
you
say
we
ought
to
read
a
lot
of
other
cases,
what
is
your
response
to
the
rather
clear
language
in
the
helms
case
that
a
monetary
settlement
or
a
change
in
conduct
that
redresses
the
plaintiff's
grievances,
when
that
occurs,
the
plaintiff
is
deemed
to
have
prevailed
despite
the
absence
of
a
formal
judgment
in
his
favor.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
reads
on
this
case.
there's
a
fact
question,
of
course,
but
it
certainly
doesn't
say
there's
got
to
be
a
settlement.
it
says,
despite
the
absence
of
a
formal
judgment,
and
it
doesn't
require
a
settlement
or
a
change
in
conduct
that
redresses
the
plaintiff's
grievances.
you
just
say
we
should
abandon
that
language.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
read
a
lot
of
other
cases
and
read
it
in
context,
is
what
your
answer
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
refresh
my
memory.
in
farrar,
did
they
affirm
or
reverse
the
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
held
there
was
a
prevailing
party,
but
didn't
we
say
there
were
no
fees
that
were
due?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--didn't
prevail
enough.
[laughter]
