mr.
david
p.
cleek
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
say
at
the
outset
i
want
to
respond
to
a
couple
of
the
remarks
that
have
been
made
in
the
arguments
by
counsel
for
the
united
states
and
also
for
the
petitioner's
counsel.
it
was
an
inaccuracy,
and
i'm
certain
an
inadvertent
inaccuracy,
by
counsel
that
this
is
an
ex
parte
young
situation
where
you
only
have
injunctive
relief
requested.
there
was
actually
a
demand
in
this
case
for
punitive
damages
and
compensatory
damages,
and
that
claim
was
voluntarily
dropped
by
the
plaintiff.
now,
in
response
to
justice
kennedy's
question--
mr.
david
p.
cleek
--that's
right.
the
damage
claims
would
have
been
against
the
individuals
in
their
personal
capacities.
mr.
david
p.
cleek
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
that's
the
only
way
a
damage
claim
could
have
been
returned
in
this
case,
in
view
of
the
rule
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
nonetheless
those
claims
were
made,
punitive
and
compensatory
damage
claims
were
made
in
the
original
complaint
and
the
amended
complaint.
i
should
also
point
out
to
the
court
that,
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
the--
mr.
david
p.
cleek
--they
were
dismissed
by
a
voluntary
action
of
the
plaintiff.
i
don't
know
the
motivation
for
that.
mr.
david
p.
cleek
to
the
damage
claims?
mr.
david
p.
cleek
those
had
not
been
addressed,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
i
recall,
with
regard
to
the
discovery
in
this
case,
the
only
people
who
had
been
deposed
were
two
persons
from
the
fire
commission,
the
fire
marshal
and
an
assistant,
and
some
experts.
mr.
david
p.
cleek
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
cleek
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
david
p.
cleek
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
cleek
we
denied
that
there
was...
it
was
a
denial
that
there
were
any
damages
due.
mr.
david
p.
cleek
there
was
an
eleventh
amendment
defense
asserted,
but
with
regard
to
those
damage
claims,
i
assumed,
from
reading
the
complaint,
that
they
were
against
individuals
in
their
personal
capacity,
otherwise
they
couldn't
be
returnable
against
the
state.
mr.
david
p.
cleek
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct,
and
let
me
respond
for
a
moment
about
the
issue
about
the
intrusion
into
legislative
prerogative
here
that
this
catalyst
theory
may
engender.
mr.
arceneaux,
the
petitioner's
counsel,
on
page
44
and
45
of
the
initial
brief
in
this
case,
sets
out
that
if
he
is
entitled
to
review
in
front
of
the
district
court,
some
theory
under
the
catalyst
theory
that
he's...
he
motivated
by
his
lawsuit
the
state
to
take
some
voluntary
action
here,
he
suggests
in
his
initial
brief
that
the
legislative
enactment
would
be
part
of
his
inquiry.
in
his
reply
brief,
for
the
first
time,
he
suggests
that
that's
not
going
to
happen,
and
that
it's
going
to
be
an
agency
issue,
and
the
legislature
will
not
be
addressed.
for
the
first
time
in
the
reply
brief
we
also
find
that
petitioners
have
suggested
that
they
prevailed
because
they
got
this
agreed
order.
that's
never
been
a
demand
to
the
district
court
for
attorneys'
fees
in
any
case.
mr.
david
p.
cleek
there
are
two
means--
mr.
david
p.
cleek
--two
means
to
address
that
issue,
your
honor.
firstly,
if
the
district
court
decides
that
the
voluntary
action
that
ceases
whatever
activity
there
is--
mr.
david
p.
cleek
--just
enforcement
of
this
regulation,
or
whatever,
does
not
moot
the
case,
then
you
can
proceed
to
merits.
mr.
david
p.
cleek
in
that
case,
that
is
the
one
area
in
which
it
would
appear
that
unless
congress
has
approved
the
catalyst
theory,
assuming
the
catalyst
theory
is
the
only
means
of
addressing
that
mootness
issue,
unless
congress
has
approved
the
catalyst
theory,
there's
no
relief
there.
mr.
david
p.
cleek
your
honor,
this
court
has
recognized
in
maher
and
farrar
as
well,
and
also
it's
indicated
in
the
legislative
history,
that
settlements
constitute
prevailing
party
status.
now,
if
your
question
is,
if
the
state
or
any
governmental
body
can
simply
say,
we're
going
to
stop,
and
not
enter
into
an
enforceable
agreement,
is
that
going
to
prevent
settlements?
as
a
matter
of
judicial
policy,
of
course,
settlements
are
preferred.
would
it
cut
down
on
them?
there's
the
possibility,
but
i
think--
mr.
david
p.
cleek
--it
could
affect,
in
candor,
a
settlement
where
a
regulation
is
involved
or
where
a
policy
is
involved,
because
in
that
case
it
is
arguable
that
the
governmental
body
could
simply
stop
the
conduct
and
moot
the
case.
mr.
david
p.
cleek
your
honor--
mr.
david
p.
cleek
--i
have
been
litigating
these
cases
for
27
years,
even
before
the
attorneys'
fees
act,
and
i
have
not
had
the
occasion
to
see
any
cases
where
they
weren't--
mr.
david
p.
cleek
--this
is
an
example
of
it--
mr.
david
p.
cleek
--yes.
it's
an
example
of
the
worst
that
can
happen
under
a
circumstance
where
there's
an
argument,
at
least,
to
be
made
by
someone
who
suggests
that
there
was
a
but-for
element
of
the
government's
action
that
is
related
to
the
lawsuit.
this
case
that
you
have
before
you
is
the
kind
of
case
that
suggests
that
there
ought
to
be
some
other
avenue
to
address
a
case
where
some
voluntary
action
moots
the
case.
however,
if
congress
hasn't
provided
for
that,
justice
stevens,
then
it
doesn't
exist
and,
as
the
court
pointed
out
earlier,
if
you
connect
these
fee-shifting
statutes
in
any
action
a
prevailing
party
may
be
entitled
to
fees,
it
has
to
be
within
the
action.
we're
talking
here,
your
honor,
about
a
nonparty
who
takes
the
action.
mr.
david
p.
cleek
your
honor,
you're
quite
right.
the
house
report
refers
to
the
voluntary
cessation
of
an
unlawful
act.
obviously,
if
government
quits
a
lawful
act,
even
if
it's
accused...
even
if
the
allegation
is
it's
an
improper
act,
then
attorneys'
fees
would
not
be
appropriate.
where
an
unlawful
act
is
used
there,
this
court
has
repeatedly,
from
hanrahan,
to
hewitt,
to
farrar,
said...
and
hewitt
says
this
as
well,
by
the
use
of
ordinary
language,
prevailing
party
means
that
you
must
get
some
success
on
the
merits.
the
catalyst
theory
doesn't
provide
for
that.
mr.
david
p.
cleek
your
honor,
i
think
that
you're
wrong
for
this
reason.
the
whole
background
for
1988,
and
of
course
we're
interpreting
the
two
statutes
here
for
prevailing
party
considerations
based
on
1988,
the
whole
background
for
1988
is
alyeska.
the
united
states
district
courts
don't
have
equity
power
to
give
attorneys'
fees,
so
congress
must
explicitly
set
out
what
the
parameters
of
that
power
is
and
describe,
pick
who
gets
it.
congress
decided
in
this
case
prevailing
parties
got
it.
now,
the
house
report
does
refer
to
informal
relief,
but
the
informal
relief,
your
honor,
could
be
a
settlement.
the
informal
relief
could
be
a
consent
decree.
mr.
david
p.
cleek
all
right,
sir.
let
me
respond
in
this
manner.
the
hewitt
case
does
suggest,
particularly
in
declaratory
judgment
case,
that
a
voluntary
change
that
affords
the
relief
might
make
the
person
prevailing
in
that
circumstance.
i
believe
that
hewitt
has
to
be
read
with
the
other
cases
that
this
court
has
considered,
from
hanrahan
to
hewitt,
and
including
hewitt,
that
say
you
must
get
success
on
the
merits.
now,
that
voluntary
change,
success
on
the
merits,
and
then
we
have
texas
teachers
v.
garland
two
years
later
that
says
there
must
be
a
material
alteration
of
the
legal
relationship
of
the
parties,
and
then
farrar,
that
says
it
must
be
formalized
in
some
fashion,
all
those
must
be
read
together.
if
you
read
hewitt
by
itself,
it
does
support
an
argument
for
the
other
side.
i
can't
deny
that.
but
hewitt
must
be
read
with
all
of
these
other
considerations,
and
when
you
read
it
with
all
those
other
considerations,
it
does
not
support
the
catalyst--
mr.
david
p.
cleek
--your
honor,
i
think
that
you
can
do
that,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
makes
eminent
good
sense,
because
otherwise
the
use
of
unlawful
would
have
been
unnecessary.
mr.
david
p.
cleek
your
honor,
that
argument
has
been
made
by
the
petitioners
and
their
amici
in
this
case,
and
what
i
think
you're
suggesting
is,
if
you
have
a
settlement
that
congress
has
recognized
and
this
court
has
recognized
grants
prevailing
party
status,
then
if
you
have
a
voluntary
act
that
affords
the
same
sort
of
relief,
how
is
that
any
different.
the
difference
is
this.
a
settlement,
of
course,
clearly,
obviously,
is
tied
to
a
litigation.
we
don't
need
to
have
district
courts
deciding
whether
52
legislators
met
by
their
action--
mr.
david
p.
cleek
--your
honor,
the
only
way
i
can
respond
to
that
sensibly
is
that
congress
had
the
right
to
choose.
they
chose
settlement.
mr.
david
p.
cleek
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
david
p.
cleek
your
honor,
and
let
me
follow
up
that
with
this
comment.
if
congress,
when
it
enacted
1988,
understood
the
difficulties
that
the
courts
faced
in
controlling
their
dockets,
and
congested
dockets,
if
they
understood
the
difficulties
that
this
catalyst
theory
might
present
in
this
kind
of
case,
where
you
may
be
having
the
legislators'
motives
inquired
into,
and
depositions
of
those
officials,
if
congress
understood
that,
and
if
congress
appreciated
those
problems
as
well
as
what
we
have
in
circuit
courts...
we
have
all
sorts
of
different
requirements
for
proving
catalyst
theory,
from
provocative
in
the
first
circuit--
mr.
david
p.
cleek
--yes,
i
would.
mr.
david
p.
cleek
yes,
i
would,
and
the
reason,
your
honor,
is,
that
i
believe--
mr.
david
p.
cleek
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
only
reason
this
court
should
address
the
legislative
difficulties
and
the
concerns
about
intrusions
into
the
motivations
of
legislators
is
that
that
is
such
an
important
issue
that
if
the
court
accepts
the
catalyst
theory
that
if
there's
an
exception
to
be
made
for
that
area,
then
it
ought
to
be
made,
but
with
regard
to
your
first
question
about
whether
or
not,
if
the
fire
marshal
had
simply
changed
the
rule
and
been
motivated
by
the
lawsuit
there
would
have
been
recovery,
the
answer
is
still
no,
because
the
catalyst
theory
is
not
recognized,
in
our
view,
under
the
prevailing
party
designation
in
1988
or
any
of
the
other
fee-shifting
statutes.
it
does
not
include--
mr.
david
p.
cleek
--no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
at
all,
and
i
think
that
i
addressed
that
issue
earlier
with--
mr.
david
p.
cleek
--that
is
the
only
means
that
i
can
address
that
language
and
explain
it.
that
language
suggests
that
you
would
prevail
if
there
was
a
voluntary
change
by
the
defendant
in
the
course
of
the
litigation.
the
only
way
that
i
can
respond
to
that
is
to
suggest
what
i
suggested
to
justice
breyer's
question,
is
that
all
these
cases
must
be
read
in
context.
if
you
isolate
that
language
out,
then
you
have
difficulty.
mr.
david
p.
cleek
it
was,
your
honor.
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
resolution
of
that
case.
and
let
me
say
this
about
hewitt,
and
your
honor,
of
course,
this
is
perhaps
suggesting
hypotheticals
one
ought
to
be
entertaining
from
the
court,
but
if
we
took
hewitt
out,
let's
assume
that
hewitt
never
happened,
and
you
read
hanrahan
and
hensley
and
rhodes
and
texas
teachers
and
farrar,
there
is
no
support
in
any
of
those
cases
for
the
catalyst
theory.
the
only
support--
mr.
david
p.
cleek
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
cleek
in
fact,
this
court
found
that
they
were
a
prevailing
party
because
even
the
$1
caused
a
change
in
the
legal
relationship
between
the
parties,
because
the
defendant
had
to
pay
something
to
the
plaintiff
he
otherwise
wouldn't
have
had
to
pay,
but
farrar
still...
and
you
know,
if
we
have
dicta
in
hewitt,
and
dicta
in
farrar,
both
sides
are
arguing
that
they
have
some
value,
but
if
we
look
at
farrar
just
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
what
this
court
said
is
a
definition
of
the
parameters
of
prevailing
party,
if
we
look
at
it
just
for
that
purpose
alone,
then
i
think
that
the
argument
that
we
made
that
it's
not
consistent
with
the
catalyst
theory
is
very
easily
made
and
very
easily
understood.
now,
if
the
court
was
willing
to
say--
mr.
david
p.
cleek
--yes.
mr.
david
p.
cleek
i'm
not
quarreling
with
that.
the
language
is
clear
in
friends
of
the
earth
that
farrar
was
not
a
catalyst
case,
and
i'm
not
arguing
that
farrar
was
a
catalyst
case.
what
i'm
arguing
is
that
farrar
set
out
parameters
for
prevailing
party
which
has
to
be
utilized
by
this
court
and
analyzed
in
any
sort
of
attorneys'
fees
matter
before
the
court.
so
we
have--
mr.
david
p.
cleek
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
cleek
and
the
court
found
that
they
were
a
prevailing
party--
mr.
david
p.
cleek
--that's
correct
and,
of
course,
the
court
continued
to
say
that
under
those
circumstances,
even
to
be
given
that
designation
was
insufficient
to
award
fees,
because
there
were
just
some
cases
where
there
was
no
entitlement.
mr.
david
p.
cleek
you
reversed
the
lower
court,
i
believe,
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
cleek
that's
correct,
and
i
think
what
the
lower
court
had
said,
that
there
wasn't
prevailing
party
status,
that's
my
recollection,
and
there
was
some
difference
there.
we
had...
essentially
the
lower
court
had
found
that
there
were
no
fees,
no
entitlement
to
fees
and,
of
course,
farrar
found
that
there
were
no
entitlement
to
fees
as
well.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
david
p.
cleek
--it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
in
farrar
that--
mr.
david
p.
cleek
--right,
that
it
was
just
such
a--
mr.
david
p.
cleek
--it
was
a
de
minimis--
mr.
david
p.
cleek
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
p.
cleek
thank
you,
your
honor.
