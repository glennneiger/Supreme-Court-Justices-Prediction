justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right,
suppose
i
sue
my
next-door
neighbor
for
making
loud
music
at
night
and
keeping
me
awake,
all
right.
he
turns
off
the
music,
and
i
drop
the
lawsuit.
why
am
i
the
prevailing
party?
i
mean,
we
both...
everybody
agrees
on
the
facts.
i
got
exactly
what
i
wanted,
but
also
there
is
no
piece
of
paper
in
the
suit
that
says
anything.
all
it
says
is,
the
suit
is
dropped.
now,
i
think
the
chief
justice
and
justice
o'connor
and
i
wanted
to
know
why
that's
a
prevailing
party
within
the
meaning
of
the
word
prevailing
in
this
statute.
nobody
doubts
you
got
what
you
wanted,
but
why
is
that
sufficient?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
those
are
cases
in
which
there
was
no
piece
of
paper
saying
anything?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
the
question
is,
is
there
a
case
which,
the
person
got
just
what
he
wanted,
but
there
is
no
piece
of
paper
saying
anything
in
the
lawsuit.
all
there
is,
is
that
the
plaintiff
dropped
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
we're
back
to
my
question.
why,
given
this
statute,
is
the
word
prevailing
party
here
to
be
interpreted
to
mean
you
are
a
prevailing
party,
even
though
there
is
no
piece
of
paper
saying
anything
in
the
lawsuit--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
for
a
piece
of
paper
that
says,
i
terminate
the
lawsuit?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
basic
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
the
case,
and
i
want
to
hear
your
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
object
to
tough
causation
requirements?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
respect
justice
scalia's
practical
point,
which
i
thought
was
correct,
isn't
it?
it's
a
correct
point
that
sometimes
the
legislature
would
be
in
just
the
situation
he
mentioned.
i
wonder
if
that's
neatly
counterbalanced
by
what
i
would
think
would
be
a
worse
problem
the
other
way,
namely,
the
plaintiff
has
to
fight
to
the
last
ditch,
because
if...
he
can
never
settle,
because
if
he
doesn't
push
his
most
unreasonable
claim,
he
won't
get
any
attorneys'
fees.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
also
is
a
practical
problem,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
a
practical
problem
also
for
the
legislature
to
be
caught
in
what
i'd
call
a
formal
settlement,
with
a
government
department?
i've
seen
a
few
of
those,
and
if
the
only
way
you
get
attorneys'
fees
is
to
force
the
court
to
enter
some
kind
of
complex
settlement
decree,
is
it
clear
what
happens
later
in
state
government?
i
mean,
i've
seen
an
awful
lot
where
the
legislature
feels
bound
by
a
settlement
decree
of
private
parties,
with
a
separate...
do
you
see
my
problem?
i
don't
know
if
it's
a
practical
problem,
but
i'd
like
you
to
comment
on
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
recover
only
if
a
there's
a
piece
of
paper
called,
settlement,
that
means
there
are
words
on
a
piece
of
paper--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--filed
in
court,
those
words
can
sometimes
extend
to
thousands
of
pages,
and
legislatures
and
governments
don't
like
to
be
subject
to
such
decrees.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
you
say...
if
we're
at
that
point,
that
is,
if
you
agree...
given
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
i
think
you
do
agree
that
if
you
look
at
the
practicalities,
for
every
bad
thing
you
can
find
one
side
you
can
find
a
bad
thing
the
other
side.
we
can
match
example
for
example.
then
you're
back
to
the
language.
all
right,
what
about
the
language?
prevailing
party
covers
their
case
literally.
then
you
have
farrar,
which
favors
you.
then
you
have,
i
take
it,
hewitt,
which
uses
an
example
of
where
you
could
recover
where
there
is,
quote,
a
change
in
conduct
that
redresses
the
plaintiff's
grievances,
and
then
we
have
the
statutory
legislative
history
where
they
define
in
the
house
report,
prevailing
party,
they
say,
a
court
should
still
award
fees
where,
after
a
complaint
is
filed,
a
defendant
might
voluntarily
cease
the
unlawful
practice.
all
right.
is
that
it?
it
seems
to
me
we
now
have
the
whole
case,
and
you
have
to
balance
the
practicalities
and
decide
whether
you're
going
to
give
credit
to
that
house
report.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
house
report?
i
took
it
that
hewitt
and
the
house
report
in
particular
are
thinking
of
the
case
where
a
complaint
is
filed
charging
x
as
unlawful,
and
before
there
is
an
adjudication
the
defendant
ceases
the
unlawful
practice,
and
it
says
in
that
instance
the
court
should
still
award
fees,
even
though
it
concludes
that
no
formal
relief
is
necessary.
now,
as
i
read
that
report,
i
thought
it
certainly
favors
your
opponents,
and
then
the
question
would
be
whether
this
court
should
credit
it.
now,
i'm
asking
you
that
because
i
want
to...
you
know,
i
want
you
to
point
out
why
i'm
wrong,
if
i'm
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
in
looking...
right
in
this,
where
it
says
voluntarily
ceasing,
i
didn't
think
it
was
formal,
but
then
i
thought
many
of
these
statutes
were
passed
at
a
time
where
civil
rights
violations
all
over
the
country
were
common,
and
many
of
the
statutes
were
passed
to
end
widespread
violations
of
civil
rights.
now,
with
that
in
the
back
of
my
mind,
would
i
think
that
congress
would
want
plaintiffs
to
get
their
attorneys'
fees
where
they
led
to
the
cessation
of
civil
rights
violations?
i
would
think
yes.
but
that's
a
general
comment,
and
i
want
you
to
respond
to
that,
to
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
about
that.
