ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
categorical
rule
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
allows
fees
only
in
a
case
where
there
is
a
judgment,
consent
decree,
or
settlement,
is
contrary
to
the
text,
history,
and
purpose
of
the
civil
rights
fee-shifting
statutes.
that
rule
would
deny
fees
in
the
most
meritorious
case
that
directly
obtains
all
of
the
relief
sought
in
that
case
if
the
defendant
on
the
eve
of
trial
complies
with
the
demand
without
a
court
order.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
it
appears,
your
honor,
that
it
was,
in
fact,
moot
because
of
a
legislative
change
under
this
court's
standards
in
laidlaw
and
city
of
mesquite.
there's
such
a
minuscule
likelihood
that
that
law
would
be
changed
back.
the
plaintiff
did
contest
mootness
at
the
trial
court
level--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes,
for
mootness,
your
honor.
that's
under
the
laidlaw
case
from
last
term
and
also
the
city
of
mesquite
case,
that's
correct.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor,
because
this
is
ex
parte
young
case
against
state
officials
enforcing
a
law.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
often
the
situation.
also,
there
are
several
statutes
that
we
cite
in
a
footnote
of
our
brief
that
limit
relief
in
civil
rights
cases
to
injunctive
relief,
and
those
are
often
the
most
important
kinds
of
cases
that
the
fee-shifting
statutes
are
intended
to
get
at,
where
a
plaintiff
has
a
meritorious
claim
for
injunctive
relief
to
enforce
a
civil
rights
law,
but
does
not
have
the
money
to
pay
an
attorney,
and
no
possibility
of
a
damages
relief
that
could
perhaps
pay
those
attorneys'
fees.
the
court
of
appeals'
categorical
rule
undermines
that.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
a
couple
of--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--a
couple
of
responses,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i
just
want
to
make
clear
that,
of
course,
the
catalyst
rule
does
not
just
apply
to
legislative
change,
and
also
a
point
i
want
to
get
to
later
that
it
also
applies
in
settlements
and
consent
decree
cases,
but
talking
about
the
application
of
that
to
a
situation
in
which
there
is
a
legislative
change
that
would...
the
legislature
would
want
to
make
as
a
matter
of
policy,
there
are
several
approaches
that
the
defendant
has
available.
first
of
all,
the
defendant
has
it
within
his
control,
if
they
make
that
decision
promptly,
to
avoid
the
build-up
of
attorneys'
fees.
indeed,
that's
what
often
happens
in
government
cases.
the
most
meritorious
of
claim
may
come
in.
there
may
be
a
settlement
within
a
week.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
in
addition
to
that,
the
defendant
is
able
to
defend
against
the
causation
and
the
merits
issue
in
this
type
of
litigation.
for
example,
if
the
legislature
has
another
reason,
they
were
already
considering
it,
policy
reasons,
the
plaintiff
will
not
be
able
to
establish
causation.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no.
you
would
have
to
show
that
the
claim
was
not
meritless.
our
proposition
is--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--that
you
would
have
to
show
that
the
merit...
that--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--that
would
not--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--that
would
not
establish
the
causation
requirement,
and
i
want
to--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--because
it
would
not
establish
that
that
change
was
made
as
a
result
of
the
lawsuit.
there's
two
aspects
of
the
causation,
mr.
chief
justice.
there's
the
causation
as
a
matter
of
fact,
but
then
there's
also
the
question
more
of
a
proximate
causation,
that
that
change
has
to
be
because
of
the
claim,
not
because
of
the
nuisance
value
of
the
lawsuit,
for
example.
that's
why
there
is...
the
lower
courts
have
always
applied
the
type
of
frivolousness
standard,
and
we
suggest
it
should
be
a
standard
where
you
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted.
and
if
i
could,
your
honor,
i
want
to
really
make
the
point
clear
that
that
is
the
same
standard
the
courts
currently,
and
have
for
a
long
time,
applied
to
cases
involving
consent
decrees
and
settlements.
there's
no
reason
to
treat
this
case
differently
because--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--and
you
do
have
something
to
show
in
these
cases.
you
obtained
the
relief
that
you
sought.
in
this
particular
case,
you
have
a
law
to
enforce,
a
regulation
to
enforce--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
your
honor,
and
in
a
settlement,
it
is
very
analogous
to
a
settlement
and
a
consent
decree.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
but
it's
simply
a
contract,
your
honor,
just
as
the
law
here,
a
separate
lawsuit
would
have
to
be
brought
to
enforce
that,
in
fact,
under
this
court's
opinion
in
kincannon,
it's
not
even
clear
there
would
be
a
federal
cause
of
action
to
enforce
that.
moreover,
even
if--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--as
your
opinion
explains--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--but,
your
honor,
it
depends.
if
the
court
incorporates
that,
otherwise
you
just
have
a
contract.
you
have
to
go
prove
the
validity
of
that
contract.
here,
they
have
a
cease
and
desist
order
that
was
pending
against
them
before
the
lawsuit
that
can
no
longer
be
enforced.
they
have
a
statute
and
a
regulation
they
can
enforce.
i
also
want
to
point
out
that
in
both
the
consent
decree
and
settlement
situations,
there
is
no
requirement
of
a
determination
of
any
violation
of
law,
any
determination
of
liability.
in
fact,
as
this
court
repeatedly
has
recognized,
that's
one
of
the
motivations
for
settlements,
consent
decrees,
to
be
able
to
resolve
the
case
without
an
admission
of
liability.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
must
have
misspoken.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
thought
your
question
to
me
was
a
situation
in
which
there
were
other
policy
reasons
that
the
legislature
had
taken
into
account
to
change
the
law.
if
the
lawsuit
is
a
factual
causation
for
the
relief,
the
relief
is
something
that
the
plaintiff
sought,
and
if
the
claim
is
not
meritless,
that
does
meet
the
standard
for--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--if
it--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--if
the
lawsuit
brought
that
about.
i
have
to
emphasize--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--proximate
causation
does
come
to
mind,
your
honor,
when
we
talk
about
the
fact
that
it
cannot
be
a
frivolous
or
a
meritless
claim--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
the
lower
courts
have
rejected
just
those
types
of
claims--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
believe
that
that's
the
meaning
of
the
statute--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--exactly,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
exactly,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
absolutely
correct,
and
this
is
the
most
efficient...
may
i
respond
to
that--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--thank
you,
your
honor.
