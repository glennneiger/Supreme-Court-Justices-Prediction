mr.

chief

william
h.
rehnquist
you
said,
i
thought,
that
you
wouldn't
have
to
deal
with
the
legislature
at
all,
but
here
it
had
to
be
passed
by
the
legislature.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
amazed
that
you
say
that.
i
would
have
thought
that
anything
the
legislature
enacted,
you
would
say
the
legislature
made
a
decision
to
enact
it.
do
you
think
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
well,
how
do
you
get
from
the
fire
marshal's
change
of
mind
to
the
legislature's
legislation?
what's
the
interim
step?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
arceneaux.
ms.
brinkmann,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief

--why
wouldn't
it,
ms.
brinkmann?
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
think
that's
enough,
ms.
brinkmann.

i
have
the
opinions
of

in

cases:

first
99-1848
buckhannon
board
&
care
home,
inc.
versus
west
virginia
department
of
health
and
human
resources.
buckhannon,
which
is
the
petitioner,
operates
in
assisted
living
residences
in
west
virginia.
it
failed
the
state
fire
inspection
because
some
of
its
residents
were
incapable
of
removing
themselves
from
dangerous
situations,
which
the
state
law
required.
facing
in
order
to
close
its
facilities
buckhannon
brought
suit
against
the
state
arguing
that
this
self-preservation
requirement
violated
two
federal
antidiscrimination
statutes.
in
the
midst
of
this
litigation
the
west
virginia
legislature
eliminated
the
self-preservation
requirement
and
the
district
court
dismissed
the
case
as
moot.
buckhannon
then
requested
that
the
state
pay
its
attorney’s
fees,
arguing
that
its
lawsuit
had
acted
as
a
catalyst
for
change.
federal
statutes
permit
such
an
award
to
the
prevailing
party,
but
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
buckhannon
was
not
in
these
circumstances
the
‘prevailing
party’.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm.
in
designating
those
parties
eligible
for
an
award
of
attorney’s
fees
congress
used
the
term
‘prevailing
party’.
this
is
a
legal
term
of
art,
‘a
prevailing
party’
is
one
who
has
been
awarded
some
relief
by
the
court.
although,
we
have
not
previously
addressed
the
catalyst
theory
pressed
by
buckhannon,
our
prior
decisions
on
this
subject
have
only
allowed
an
award
of
attorney’s
fees
where
the
plaintiff
had
prevailed
on
the
merits
of
at
least
some
of
its
claims
or
had
obtained
a
court
order
change
in
the
legal
relationship
with
the
parties.
the
catalyst
theory,
however,
does
not
require
that
the
lawsuit
have
legal
merit
and
a
defendant’s
voluntary
change
in
conduct
although
perhaps
accomplishing
what
the
plaintiff
sought
to
achieve
by
the
lawsuit,
lacks
the
necessary
judicial
imprimatur
on
the
change.
our
precedents
thus
counsel
against
awarding
attorney's
fees
without
a
corresponding
alteration
in
the
legal
relationship
with
the
parties.
buckhannon
argues
that
the
legislative
history
to
these
acts
supports
its
broad
reading
of
prevailing
party,
but
we
are
not
convinced
by
that,
we
think
the
legislative
history
is
at
best
ambiguous,
and
this
is
insufficient
to
overcome
the
plain
text
of
the
statute.
particularly,
in
the
light
of
the
well
established
rule
that
parties
will
bear
their
own
litigation
expenses
absent
explicit
statutory
authority,
to
the
contrary
and
while
the
parties
make
various
policies
arguments
both
for
and
against
the
catalyst
theory,
we
have
no
authority
to
disregard
clear
statutory
language
in
our
prior
holdings
on
policy
grounds.
because
buckhannon
has
not
been
awarded
any
judicial
relief
in
this
case,
it
is
not
the
prevailing
party
and
therefore
not
entitled
to
attorney’s
fees.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
has
joined.
