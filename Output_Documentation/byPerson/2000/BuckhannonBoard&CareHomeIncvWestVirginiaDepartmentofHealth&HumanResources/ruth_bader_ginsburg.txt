justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
would
have
to
establish
it.
it's
not
just
a
factor.
you
would
have
to
show--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
the
litigation
caused
the
result,
caused,
in
this
case,
the
homes
to
remain
open,
even
though
they
didn't
have
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
rely
at
all
on
your
warding
off
the
cease
and
desist
order?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which,
if
you
had
done
nothing
would
have
surely
followed,
and
then
you
would
have
been
the
object
of
an
adverse
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
just
ask
for
a
clarification?
i
thought
that
to
the
extent
that
the
action
was
against
the
state,
it
couldn't
be
brought,
you
couldn't
get
damages.
the
only
thing
you
could
get
against
the
state
was
injunctive
relief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
is...
that
would
be
rather
strange,
wouldn't
it,
to
say
these
officials,
who
were
clearly
acting
in
their
official
capacity
in
having
a
fire
code
and
a
cease
and
desist
order,
that
they
were
doing
something
in
their
personal
capacities?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
on
what
ground
were
they
dismissed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
hadn't
put
in
a
defense
to
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean,
an
answer.
i
mean,
you
said
they
made
a
complaint
that
included
a
request
for
punitive
damages
and
compensatory
damages--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--against
the
defendants.
defendants
put
an
answer
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
that
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
was
the
answer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
what
ground,
because
this
was
a
claim
about
state
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
want
to
deflect
you
on
this,
but
to
the
extent
that
they
were
seeking
injunctive
relief
it
was
a
pure
ex
parte
young
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
dividing
line
that
you
put
with
a
settlement...
now,
a
settlement,
many
of
these
settlements,
am
i
not
right,
say,
i
don't
admit
that
i
did
one
thing
wrong,
but
i'm
settling
this
lawsuit,
and
the
congress
would
make
a
distinction
between
that
kind
of
settlement
just
because
it's
on
a
piece
of
paper
filed
in
court,
where
the
defendant
said,
i
am
paying
the
plaintiff
out
of
the
goodness
of
my
heart,
but
we
were
never
any
wrongdoers.
we
never
violated
any
law.
that
counts
for
the
catalyst,
because
it's
a
settlement,
and
then
to
say
if
the
same
exact
thing
happens,
it
doesn't
count,
that
seems
irrational
to
me.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that
means
that
the
causation
problem
is
not
a
problem.
the
causation
problem
is
not
a
problem,
but
it
doesn't
strike
it
out
if
there
is...
this
case
is
difficult
because
of
the
legislative
action,
but
there
are
other
cases
where
it's
just
as
clear
that
the
plaintiff
propelled
this
action
on
the
part
of
defendant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
wasn't
at
issue.
it
wasn't
at
issue
in
farrar.
there
was
a
judgment.
there
was
a
judgment,
but
it
was
just
for
$1,
so
anything
that
farrar
said
would
have
been
the
clearest
dictum,
because
there
was
a
prevailing
party,
not
by
much,
and
there
were
no
fees,
because
the
court
said,
i'm
not
going
to
give
you
attorneys'
fees
for
a
$1
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
no
doubt
that
there
was
a
prevailing
party
in
that
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
thought
you
accepted
that
this
court
had
said
in
friends
of
the
earth
that
the
catalyst
theory
remained
an
open
question
and
that
farrar
did
not
deal
with
it.
that's
what
the
court
said
in
friends
of
the
earth,
and
i
didn't
think--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
were
quarreling
with
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
have
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
joined
by
justices
stevens,
souter,
and
breyer.
under
west
virginia’s
so-called
self-preservation
rule,
102
year
old
dorsey
pierce
faced
eviction
from
an
elder
care
home
buckhannon
because
the
rule
judged
her
too
frail.
buckhannon
joined
by
pierce
commenced
litigation
under
federal
civil
rights
laws
to
stop
west
virginia
from
requiring
buckhannon
to
evict
pierce
and
others
similarly
disabled
as
the
price
of
remaining
in
business.
in
response
to
the
suit,
the
trial
court
issued
an
immediate
stop
order
discovering
in
suit,
and
west
virginia
ultimately
decided
to
change
the
rule
that
would
have
forced
pierce
out
of
buckhannon.
buckhannon
then
sought
attorney’s
fee,
urging
that
it
had
for
all
practical
purposes
prevailed
in
the
case
and
that
its
attorneys
where
the
catalyst
put
the
change
in
west
virginia
law.
our
proof
of
such
a
claim
until
today’s
decision
in
11
of
the
12
federal
judicial
circuits;
courts
had
discretion
to
award
these.
now,
across
the
country
and
legions
of
such
cases,
on
the
scores
of
federal
fee
shifting
statutes,
no
fee
award
can
be
made.
persuaded
that
congress
intended
to
authorize
fees
in
cases
like
dorsey
pierce’
i
dissent
from
this
court's
legally,
unwarranted,
stunningly
harsh
judgment.
justices
stevens,
souter
and
breyer
agree
with
me
that
the
assessment
of
the
large
majority
of
federal
judges
was
the
right
one.
when
the
lawsuit
prompts
the
very
relief
the
plaintiff
seeks
it,
that
plaintiff
is
the
prevailing
party
eligible
for
an
award
of
attorney’s
fees
even
if
she
has
not
gained
a
court
entry
memorializing
her
victory.
when
the
court
rejects,
as
it
does
today,
the
considered
opinion,
long
held
in
so
many
federal
circuits
respect
for
our
colleagues,
demand
a
more
cogent
explanation
than
the
court
has
given.
congress
enacted
the
fee-shifting
statute
at
issue
to
ensure
that
non-affluent
plaintiffs
would
have
effective
access
to
the
nation’s
courts
to
secure
enforcement
of
laws
enacted
to
advance
their
civil
rights.
i
was
little
concerned
for
this
design
inescapably
evident
in
the
house
and
senate
reports.
the
court’s
decision
impedes
recast
to
tribunal
of
justice
for
the
less
well-healed
and
reduces
the
incentive
congress
created
for
the
enforcement
of
civil
rights
laws
by
private
attorneys
general.
featuring
a
definition
in
black’s
law
dictionary,
the
court
detects
the
clear
meaning
for
the
term
‘prevailing
party’.
one
can
agree
with
black’s
law
dictionary
that
a
party
in
whose
favor
a
judgment
is
rendered
prevails,
and
at
the
same
time
resist
any
implication
that
only
such
a
party
may
prevail.
in
prior
cases
we
have
not
treated
black’s
law
dictionary
as
the
be
all
and
end
all
of
statutory
interpretation.
nor
do
our
precedents
fall
for
the
court’s
decisions.
in
the
past,
we
have
comprehended
that
when
a
defendant
under
the
pressure
of
a
lawsuit,
alters
the
conduct
that
was
the
basis
for
the
suit,
the
plaintiff
will
have
prevailed,
i
would
adhere
to
that
understanding.
everyday
use
of
plain
english
is
a
guide
we
often
employ
in
deciding
what
congress
meant,
and
i
would
not
ignore
that
aid
here.
in
plain
english,
prevailing
does
not
invariably
entail
a
formal
declaration
of
victory,
if
you
would
dispute
for
example
that
western
democracy
has
prevailed
in
the
cold
war
even
though
the
soviet
union
never
formally
surrendered
just
so
or
still
the
party
prevails
when
she
achieves
the
practical
relief
sought
in
her
complaint.
this
case
is
paradigmatic,
because
of
the
lawsuit
plaintiff’s
allege
dorsey
pierce
escaped
eviction
and
buckhannon
succeeded
in
keeping
its
doors
open,
while
caring
for
persons
of
her
fragility.
in
sum,
the
anemic
construction
of
the
term
‘prevailing
party’,
the
court
today
imposes
in
my
view,
draw
a
scat
support
from
history,
logic,
or
precedent,
i
see
the
catalyst
rule
as
long
applied
by
the
clear
majority
of
circuits
as
a
key
component
of
the
fee-shifting
statutes
congress
adopted
to
promote
the
realization
of
civil
right.
for
reasons
spelled
out
at
some
length
in
my
dissenting
opinion,
i
would
reverse
the
fourth
circuit’s
judgment
under
the
catalyst
rule
of
fitting
an
proper
aid
in
the
vindication
of
bright,
congress
thought
to
secure.
