well,
the
language
of
the
statutes
in
each
case,
does
it
not,
refers
to
prevailing
party?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
we
do
have
to
be
satisfied
that
the
person
seeking
fees
is
a
prevailing
party.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
how
is
that
to
be
determined
where
the
case
is
dismissed
as
moot?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
have
thought
the
language,
prevailing
party,
suggests
something
else,
that
there
ought
to
be
some
nominal
damages,
or
some
judgment,
or
some
indication
that
the
person
seeking
fees
did,
in
fact,
prevail
in
a
judicial
proceeding.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
sounds
like
but-for
causation,
not
proximate
cause,
that
you're
talking
about.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
wouldn't
that
enable
an
astute
lawyer
to
kind
of
spot
administrative
or
legislative
changes
in
the
offing
and
file
some
suit
so
they
can
run
in
and
get
some
kind
of
attorney's
fees?
