justice
david
h.
souter
just
tell
me
what...
tell
us
what
happened
in
this
case.
what
happened?
what
did
the
fire
marshal
do?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
we
want
to
know
here
and
now.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
that
what
he
did?
justice
david
h.
souter
did
he
go
to
the
fire
commission
and
said,
i
want
to
change
these
rules?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
fire
commission
says,
we
agree,
we
will
change
these
rules?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
fire
commission
then
did
what?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
what--
justice
david
h.
souter
--was
the
legislation
that
was
passed
in
effect
the
verbatim
embodiment
of
what
the
fire
commission
proposed?
justice
david
h.
souter
does
it
matter
to
your
case
whether
the
fire...
whatever
it
is,
the
fire
marshal's
judgment,
or
for
that
matter
the
legislature's
judgment,
was
based
on
the
fact
that
they
thought
the
law
was
outrageous,
as
distinct
from
the
fact
that
they
may
not
have
wanted
to
take
a
hit
by
losing
this
case?
does
it
matter
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
not
my
question.
does
it
matter,
on
your
theory--
justice
david
h.
souter
--whether
they
simply
said,
we're
suddenly
aware
of
the
law
and
we
think
it's
bad
and
it
ought
to
be
changed,
or
on
the
other
hand
they
say,
we
think
the
law
is
great,
but
we
don't
want
to
lose
this
lawsuit,
so
we're
going
to
change
the
law?
does
it
matter
to
your
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
really
was.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
there
causation
in
either
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
one
cause,
the
lawsuit
brings
it
to
the
attention,
but
for
the
lawsuit
it
would
not
have
come
to
the
attention,
it
wouldn't
have
been
changed.
in
the
other
case,
there's
a
different
chain
of
causation,
but
it's
still
the
same
causation.
they
say,
in
order
to
avoid
losing,
we
get
rid
of
the
lawsuit.
is
causation
in
each
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
problem
goes
one
step
further,
doesn't
it,
because
we
have
indicated
that
settlements
may
qualify,
a
settled
case
may
have
a
prevailing
party
within
the
meaning
of
the
rule,
and
i
would
suppose
that
if
you
prevail
in
any
case
in
which
the
settlement
would
otherwise
give
the
plaintiff
the
relief
that
the
plaintiff
was
seeking,
there
just
won't
be
any
more
settlements.
there
will
simply
be
the
voluntary
provision
of
the
relief,
whether
it
be
affirmative,
or
the
cessation
of
something
the
plaintiff
is
objecting
to,
and
we're
not
going
to
get
any
more
settlement
cases
in
instances
in
which
the
plaintiff
ends
up
getting
what
the
plaintiff
wants.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
not
going
to
cut
down
on
settlements
in
which
in
effect
they
in
some
ways
split
the
difference,
but
when,
in
fact,
you
have
a
case
that
traditionally
would
have
resulted
in
a
settlement,
there
would
be
an
orderly
process,
they'd
sign
a
neither
party
docket
marking,
whatever,
and
give
it
to
the
judge,
the
judge
would
approve
it,
and
the
defendant
agrees
in
that
kind...
in
a
settled
case
to
provide
exactly
what
the
plaintiff
wants,
there'll
be
no
more
settlements.
so
it
won't
affect
the
split-the-difference
settlement,
but
it
will
affect
the
give-them-what-they-ask-for
settlement.
