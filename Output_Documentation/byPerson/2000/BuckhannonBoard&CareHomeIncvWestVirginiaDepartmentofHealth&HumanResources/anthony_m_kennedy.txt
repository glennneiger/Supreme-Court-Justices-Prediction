justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
term,
prevailing
party,
has
a
pretty
well-established
meaning
in
the
law,
doesn't
it?
it
means
you
prevailed
by
getting
something
in
a
lawsuit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
not
the
way
lawsuits
are
ordinarily
settled.
if
someone
sues
you
for
$50,000,
you
will
probably
pay
it,
but
you'll
get
a
stipulation
and
order
dismissing
the
thing.
it
will
be
a
matter
of
court
record--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
it
was
dismissed
not
because
of
mootness
but
because
you're
paid.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
arceneaux,
in
the
event
of
ambiguity,
i
am
reluctant
to
read
a
term
in
a
way
that's
going
to
get
courts
into
areas
that
it's
very
difficult
for
them
to
maneuver
in.
in
the
present
case,
you
want
the
opportunity
to
demonstrate
below
that
an
act
of
legislation,
right...
i
mean,
what
happened
was
that
the
law
was
changed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
want
to
show
that
the
legislators
who
change
the
law
were
motivated
by
this
lawsuit.
this
is
a
very
peculiar
area
for
courts
to
be
functioning
in,
to
try
to
figure
out
what
prompted
legislators
to
enact
a
particular
law.
i
mean,
would
it
be
enough
to
be
a
catalyst,
for
example,
if
one
legislator
found
out
about
this
lawsuit
and
said,
why,
that's
outrageous,
that
the
law
should
be
that
way.
in
other
words,
they
weren't
worried
about
losing
money.
all
they
were
worried
about
is,
all
the
lawsuit
did
was
bring
to
their
attention
a
disposition
that
seemed
to
them
outrageous,
and
so
they
said,
let's
change
the
law.
is
that
enough
to
be
a
catalyst?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
happy
to
hear
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i'd
like
to
know
why.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
will
you
do?
how
will
you
prove
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case,
was
the
matter
moot
as
a
matter
of
article
iii
jurisdiction,
so
the
judge
had
no
choice,
or
would
the
judge
have
had
some
discretion
to
retain
jurisdiction
to
enter
some
sort
of
declaratory
relief?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
the
usual
rule
is
that
it
must
be
absolutely
clear
that
the
alleged
wrongful
conduct
cannot
recur
before
the
case
can
be
dismissed,
is
that
the
way
the
rule
works?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
plaintiff
here
have
asked
for
nominal
damages
in
order
to
keep
the
case
alive?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
okay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
except
that
the
statute
says,
prevailing
party,
and
it's
quite
logical,
i
think,
to
read
the
term,
prevailing
party,
as
meaning
that
you
should
have
something
to
show
from
the
lawsuit
itself.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
it's
not
a
part
of
any
decree.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
except
that
a
typical
settlement,
you'll
get
some
document
from
the
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
ms.
brinkmann,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
i
think
there's
a
difference
between
your
position
and
mr.
arceneaux's.
as
i
understood
his
argument,
it
would
be
enough
if
the
legislature
learned
about
this
bad
law
through
the
lawsuit,
and
you
insist
that
the
legislature
must
have
changed
the
law
because
it
was
worried
about
losing
the
lawsuit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we'd
have
to
read
the
palzgraf
case
in
order
for
this
all
to
work
out?
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
cleek,
i'm
not--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
wasn't
that
language
dicta?
