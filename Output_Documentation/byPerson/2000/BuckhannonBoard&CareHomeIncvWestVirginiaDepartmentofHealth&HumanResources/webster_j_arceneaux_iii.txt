mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
simple
issue,
whether
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
in
this
case
that
a
party
is
not
a
prevailing
party
unless
they
obtain
a
judgment,
consent
decree,
or
settlement
is
in
accordance
with
this
court's
prior
decisions
and
the
intent
of
congress
in
establishing
the
term,
prevailing
party,
in
the
civil
rights
attorneys'
fees
award
act
of
1976,
commonly
referred
to
as
section
1988,
and
the
two
statutes
at
issue
in
this
case,
the
fair
housing
amendments
act,
and
the
americans
with
disabilities
act.
when
congress
enacted
all
three
of
these
fee-shifting
statutes,
it
did
not
condition
an
award
of
fees
only
upon
the
result
of
a
judgment,
consent
decree,
or
settlement.
in
fact,
nowhere
in
these--
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
--yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
absolutely.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
well,
i
think
in
that
situation,
we
have
a
declaration
that
the
case
is
moot,
so...
in
this
particular
case
we
had
that
as
well...
and
then
we
can
look
and
see
under
what
is
known
as
the
catalyst
theory,
whether
that
lawsuit
caused
the
defendant
to
act
to
render
that
suit
moot.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
if
we
look
just
to
the
word,
prevail,
i
believe
it
is
a
broad
word,
and
this
is
my
point.
congress
didn't
say
prevail
by
judgment,
consent
decree,
or
settlement,
congress
said
prevail,
and
i
believe
that--
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
--yes,
and
i
think
that's
a
fine
way
to
put
it.
if
i
sued
someone
for
damages
i
think
is
an
easy
way
to
put
it,
if
i
sue
them
for
$50,000,
and
they
hand
me
$50,000
and
say,
go
dismiss
this
lawsuit,
i
don't
have
a
judgment,
i
don't
have
a
consent
decree,
i
don't
have
a
settlement,
but
i
have
the
$50,000.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
that's
right,
but...
and
that's
the
same
thing
in
this
situation,
where,
when
i
sue
somebody
and
i
say,
don't
shut
down
my
home,
don't
throw
the
residents
out
of
the
home,
and
they
say,
okay,
we
won't
do
that,
now,
i
don't
have
a
judgment,
consent
decree,
or
settlement,
but
i
have
the
same
effect,
the
same
result
as
if
they
had
handed
me
the
$50,000.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
and--
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
--and
that
is
one
of
the
factors
that
is
looked
at,
whether
there
is
a
causal
relationship
between--
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
--absolutely.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
absolutely,
and
that
is
what
we
intend
to
do.
we
were
not
given
our
day
in
court,
so
to
speak,
because
we
were
not
allowed
to
proceed
with
any
factual
development
of
that,
but
we
think
that
we
have
a
very
strong
case,
and
we
will
absolutely
be
able
to
establish
the
causal
relationship.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
when
you
look
to
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
the
definition
of
prevailing
party
under
the
cases
has
been,
they
personally
achieve
some
of
the
benefits
they
sought
in
bringing
the
suit.
their
lawsuit
completely
changed
the
defendant's
behavior
towards
the
plaintiffs,
and
in
this
case
and
in
your
example--
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
--sometimes
there
are
settlement
agreements--
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
--right.
i
mean,
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression.
there's
not
been
a
case
from
this
court.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
there
are
obviously
numerous
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
right.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
two
reasons.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
yes.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
two
reasons.
first,
because
i
think
it's
consistent
with
the
meaning
of
the
word,
prevail,
which
can
also
mean
persuade,
induce,
or
influence
another
to
act,
and
second,
because
i
believe
that's
what
congress
intended.
when
one
looks
at
the
house
report,
for
instance,
it
says
similarly,
after
a
complaint
is
filed,
the
defendant
might
voluntarily
cease
the
unlawful
practice.
a
court
might
still
award
fees,
even
though
it
may
conclude
as
a
matter
of
equity
that
no
formal
relief
such
as
injunction
is
needed,
and
the
legislature
then
cites
to
the
decision
of
parham
v.
southwestern
bell
telephone
company.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
i
think
that
that--
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
--i
think
that
it
is
consistent--
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
--yes.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
yes.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
yes,
and
i
think
that
had
they--
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
--yes,
and
this
was
section
1988.
where
this
court
had
said
in
alyeska
that
we
were
not
going
to
have
attorney's
fee
award
under
what
was
called
the
private
attorney
general,
and
so
congress
intended
to
have
these
type
of
civil
rights
lawsuits
filed,
and
they
wanted
to
encourage
these
type
of
lawsuits.
that's
what
the
language
says,
and
this
is
what
is
under
the
discussion
of
prevailing
party,
and
so
the
issue
is,
is
that
what
congress
intended,
we
think
that
you
can
look
to
the
legislative
history
and
to
the
plain
meaning
of
the
terms,
prevailing
party,
and
say
that
yes,
that
is
what
is
intended
here.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
yes.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
i
do
not
think
that
we
have
to
make
that
inquiry,
your
honor.
i
think
that
while--
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
--yes.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
and
i
will
tell
you,
your
honor,
because
west
virginia
is
unique.
it
is
unlike
the
federal
government
or
most
states
in
that
administrative
agencies
cannot
promulgate
regulations.
we
don't
think
that
the
inquiry
in
this
case,
the
factual
investigation
that
we're
trying
to
establish
here,
will
involve
the
legislature
whatsoever.
certainly
we
have
no
intent,
as
one
of
the
amici
suggests,
that
we
need
to
go
out
and
depose
legislators.
this
is
not
going
to
be
an
inquiry
about
a
legislative
activity.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
we
think
that
we
have
an
overwhelmingly
strong
case,
because
what
happened
here,
we
took
the
deposition
of
the
state
fire
marshal
in
march
of
1997.
he
said
that
it
was
absolutely
impossible
for
the
state
of
west
virginia
to
adopt
this
rule.
six
to
eight
weeks
later,
he
changed
his
mind.
he
made
the
decision
to
promulgate
the
rules
and
change
the
rules
as
we
were
requesting
in
the
lawsuit.
what
happened
in
that
interim?
we
took
the
deposition
of
dr.
bernard
levin,
who
was
the
expert
who
explained
how
the
states
had
all
abandoned
the
position
that
he
was
taking.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
but
he
had
to
initiate
the
process.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
that's
correct,
but
we
don't
believe
that
in
looking
at
the
causation
analysis
we
need
to
look
at
what
the
legislature
did.
it
is
not
the
legislature
that
made
the
decision
to
change
the
rule.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
clearly
they
did,
your
honor.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
the
unique
process
of
the
rulemaking
process
that's
in
west
virginia.
these
rules
are
just
all
batched.
hundreds
of
agencies
all--
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
--and
all
of
the
exhibits
that
are
attached
to
our
motion
for
attorney's
fees
has
this
all
documented
in
it.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
yes.
the
fire
marshal
changed
his
mind,
made
a
decision
to
promulgate
these
new
rules.
he
has
to
go
to
the
fire
commission
and
then
the
fire
commission
presents
it
to
the
legislature.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
yes.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
yes.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
yes.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
then
the
fire
commission
has
to
promulgate
the
new
rules,
and
then
they
submit
them
to
the
legislature.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
there's
a
special
committee.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
i
believe
that
to
be
the
case,
and
that
is
why
i
referred
to
the
legislature
in
this
process
as
merely
a
rubber
stamp.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
we
think
he
was
motivated
by
the
lawsuit.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
well,
as
some
of
the
courts
have
noted...
i
don't
know
what
is
in
his
mind.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
yes.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
well,
we
have
two
distinctions
that
i
would
draw.
one
is,
he
knew
about
the
case,
and
he
was
deposed
in
the
case.
he
was
active.
he
attended
every
deposition,
so
it's
not
like
he's
sitting
back
in
his
office,
okay,
and
the...
i've
lost
my
second
point,
but
also
there
is
this
intervening
deposition
of
our
expert
that
he's
in
attendance
and
he
hears
what
they
have
to
say.
unlike
the
regular--
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
--well,
most
of
the
cases
that
i've
seen
where
they
talk
about
the
legislature...
and
there
are
some
cases
that
are
simple.
some
cases
they
have
found,
and
it's
right
there
in
the
legislative
history,
they
enacted
this
provision...
paris
is
an
example,
where
they
say
in
the
legislative
history,
we
don't
have
documented
legislative
history.
what
we're
saying
is,
there
should
not
be
a
per
se
rule
just
when
the
legislature
acts
that
we
cannot
then
present
our
evidence.
the
second
thing
is,
unlike
a
lot
of
the
legislative
cases,
when
they
talk
about
the
legislative
cases
they
talk
about
intervening
causation,
that
here
is
some
third
party
that
has
taken
the
lawsuit
away,
the
legislature
has
acted.
we
don't
believe
there's
any
intervening
causation
here,
because
we
were
suing
the
fire
commission
and
the
fire
marshal,
and
they're
the
ones
that
made
the
decision
to
change
this.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
yes.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
yes,
and
we
believe
that
we
prevailed.
we
were
under
cease
and
desist
orders,
and
the
homes
were
going
to
be
shut
down,
and
all
the
residents
were
going
to
be
thrown
out,
and
we
presented
expert
testimony...
these
were
clients
that
were
102
years
old,
and
that
they
could
suffer
transfer
trauma
just
by
the
very
act
of
them
being
moved
into
another
home.
we
went
in
on
a
tro.
we
were
able
to
obtain
an
agreed
order.
that
agreed
order
remained
in
place
for
the
duration
of
the
litigation,
and
no
one
was
ever
thrown
out
of
the
home.
the
homes
were
never
shut
down.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
we
think
that
it
is
part.
we
understand
that
it
was
only
a
interim
relief.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
well,
we
think
that
our
lawsuit
brought
that
to
their
attention.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
i
think
we
have
to
show--
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
--i
think
that
it
would
relate
to
the
causal
relationship.
we
do
recognize
that
we
would
have
to
establish
a
causal
relationship,
so
in
your
one
we
may
not
be
able
to
do
so.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
your
honor--
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
--maybe
i'm--
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
--maybe
i
was
just
distracted
by
the
light.
i
was
going
to--
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
--yes.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
yes,
i
agree.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
yes.
we
think--
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
--that
would
be
a
different
case.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
we
think
as
long
as
we
have
the
opportunity
to
establish
causation
we
should
be
able
to
do
so.
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
your
honor,
may
i
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal?
mr.
webster
j.
arceneaux,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
cleek
was
assuming
a
hypothetical.
i
want
to
assume
a
hypothetical
for
the
court
as
well.
let
us
assume
this
court
does
not
accept
the
catalyst
theory.
this
court
is
concerned
with
the
issue
of
administration
of
justice,
and
i
am
concerned
that
if
this
court
does
not
accept
the
catalyst
theory,
then
the
game's
been
shifted
we
talked
about
that
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
where
a
defendant
that
might
be
incredibly
guilty
on
the
eve
of
trial,
after
the
plaintiff
has
incurred
a
lot
of
expenses,
can
moot
the
case
out.
on
the
other
hand,
there
may
be
motivation
on
the
plaintiff's
part
to
start
engaging
in
gamesmanship.
we
recognize
that
once
we
had
the
consent
or
the
agreed
order,
we
did
not
have
damages.
the
home
wasn't
shut
down,
the
people
weren't
thrown
out,
we
had
no
damages,
so
we
stipulated
to
take
damages
out
of
it.
had
we
known
that
this
rule
might
have
jumped
up
at
us,
we
might
have
thought
otherwise
about
the
damages
issue,
so
there
can
be
gamesmanship
on
both
sides
if
we
don't
have
the
catalyst
theory.
we
think...
and
one
of
the
points
that
seems
to
get
lost,
we
often
talk
about
this
as
if
the
catalyst
theory
doesn't
exist,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
the
catalyst
theory
has
existed.
it
has
been
applied
for
30
years,
and
the
courts
have
not
had
trouble.
when
you
look
at
the
cases,
the
courts
are
able
to
apply
the
causation
test.
they
are
able
to
deal
with
these
issues.
the
district
courts
are
equipped
to
make
these
decisions,
and
they
have
made
these
decisions
for
30
years,
and
we
think
that
the
fourth
circuit
is
wrong,
and
this
court
should
find,
inasmuch
as
it
did
in
the
laidlaw
case,
that
farrar
had
no
catalytic
effect,
that
the
fourth
circuit
has
misread
farrar,
and
that
we
should
have
our
opportunity,
our
day
in
court
to
present
the
motion
for
attorneys'
fees.
