stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
found
it
rather
hard
to
find
that
in
my
opinion
in
medtronic,
which
was
a
separate
opinion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
would
find
it
surprising,
wouldn't
you,
that
if
you
have
a
private
right
of
action,
to
say
in
any
of
the
thousands
and
thousands
of
state
agencies
or
federal
agencies
that
what
the
state
did,
you
see,
what
these
people
did
is,
they
got
their
brief
in
late.
they
got
their
brief
in
late,
violating
the
federal...
violating
the
agency
rule,
and
if
they...
doing
that,
they
wouldn't
have
gotten
the
approval.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
would
be
no
cause
of
action
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
all
right,
so...
and
because
it
would
be
up
to
the
agency
to
enforce
its
own
rule,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no.
whether
it's
federal
or
state,
i
don't
care.
i
mean,
take
any
agency
you
want.
take
a
municipal
council,
i
don't
care.
it
would
just
be
amazing
to
me
that
you'd
find
somebody
getting
a
private
right
of
action
based
upon,
under
ordinary
tort
law
principles,
based
upon
the
agency
not
following
its
own
procedural
rules,
that
the
person
violated
some
procedural
rule,
because
you'd
say
that's
for
the
agency,
and
of
course
my
question
is,
how
is
this
any
different,
and
of
course
my
opinion
in
medtronic
says
that
we
look
to
see
what
the
agency
wants
and
if
the
agency
thinks
it's
preempted,
good
bye,
and
that
seems
to
me
in
essence
what
you
have
here.
now,
i'm
putting
it
that
to
you
to
get
an
answer,
not
because
i'm
wedded
to
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
a
number
of
things.
we're
on
precisely
the
same
track,
because
in
my
mind
i
was
thinking
substantive/procedural,
something
like
that,
and
what's
fraud,
and
then
if
i
push
it
towards...
i
can
be
elliptical
because
i
think
we're
thinking
alike.
the...
if
you
push
it
towards
the
substantive
side,
then
i
get
into
the
problem
of
the
agency
having
a
bunch
of
powers.
they
could
enforce
it
through
injunctive
relief,
monetary
penalties,
seizure,
criminal
prosecutions,
withdrawal
of
market
clearance.
and
then
i
think,
well,
shouldn't
that
be
up
to
them?
i
mean,
after
all,
their
job
is
to
protect
the
public
from
monopoly,
and
if
they
think
that
really
this
particular
misrepresentation
is
not
that
serious
in
light
of
their
basic
job,
shouldn't
it
be
up
to
them
to
decide
how
to
enforce
it
rather
than
up
to
a
jury?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
because
the
fda
doesn't
want
them
compensated
for
this
kind
of
thing
because
it's
decided
that
the
harm
to
them,
which
they're
not
understating,
would
be
outweighed
by
the
need
to
get
this
drug
on
the
market
to
fight
the
monopolistic
advantage
that
people
would
have
without
it
being
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
that's
true,
but
they
say,
the
way
we
make
these
determination
is
by
deciding
which
remedy
to
pick,
and
we
pick
the
lesser
ones
when
we
think
we
want
this
thing
on
the
market.
we
pick
the
greater
ones
when
it
should
be
gotten
rid
of,
and
if
you
leave
it
up
to
the
jury,
of
course,
that's
the
same
as
getting
rid
of
the
product.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
specifically,
assuming
what
you
say
is
right,
after
the
event
the
fda
finds
out
about
this,
it
says,
we
want
to
leave
this
stuff
out
there,
because
it's
more
helpful
than
it
is
harmful,
and
therefore
we
give
you
a
wrist
slap,
you
see,
and
why
are
they
doing
that?
because
they
want
the
drug
out
there
to
lower
price.
now,
you
come
along
and
say,
i'm
going
to
a
jury,
and
that
will
make
sure
it
can't
be
out
there.
now,
why
doesn't
this
range
of
remedies
give
the
fda
just
the
authority
that
i
mentioned,
an
authority
that
you'll
take
away
from
them
if
you
go
to
the
jury,
however
meritorious
your
case
might
be
here?
