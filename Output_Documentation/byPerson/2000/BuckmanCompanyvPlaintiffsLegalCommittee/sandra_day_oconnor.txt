mr.
geller,
is
it...
explain
to
us,
if
you
would,
the
practice
of
the
fda
with
regard
to
authorized
drugs
and
devices.
if
it
is
authorized,
is
an
off
label
use
always
allowed--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--by
the
fda?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
fact,
it's
rather
common?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
for
instance,
the
use
of,
what
is
it,
the
cholesterol
reducing
drugs
for
memory
enhancement
and
that
sort
of
thing
is
perfectly
okay,
even
though
it's
authorized
only
for
the
cholesterol?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
fishbein,
are
there
other
state
causes
of
action
that
your
client
could
pursue
that
don't
raise
this
problem
of
having
to
establish
that
the
fda
called
it
wrong,
a
failure
to
warn,
or
some
other
kind
of
negligence
cause
of
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
buckman
is
the
one
that
has
the
assets
and
therefore
you
need
a
different
cause
of
action.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
cause
of
action
does
require
the
jury
to
decide,
in
effect
to
second
guess
the
fda?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
except
section
132
of
the
complaint
says,
were
it
not
for
these
fraudulent
acts
and
statements
the
fda
would
not
have
issued
the
510(k)
clearances
for
the
screw
for
any
purpose,
the
devices
wouldn't
have
been
introduced
into
interstate
commerce,
and
plaintiff
wouldn't
have
been
exposed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
that
looks
pretty
much
like
second
guessing
to
me.
