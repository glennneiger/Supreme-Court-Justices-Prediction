justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
really
a
misnomer,
then,
if
you're
going
to
use
it
the
way
you
say
they
have
been
and
ought
to
use
it,
they
shouldn't
call
it
intended
use.
they
should
have...
it
should
be
called
permitted
use,
or
approved
use,
or
something
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
i
assume
these
plaintiffs
would
have
a
cause
of
action
against
the
physicians
who
made
the
judgment
that
it's
okay
to
use
them
for
the
spine?
justice
antonin
scalia
if,
indeed,
they're
not
safe
for
the
spine?
justice
antonin
scalia
--what's
the
federal
provision
on
fraud
on
the
fda?
what
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you'd
say
there
would
be
preemption
up
to
the
point
when
the
fda
reviews
the
matter
and
concludes
that
it
has
been
defrauded.
then
would
you
say...
i'm
just
trying
to
follow
justice
kennedy's
judicial
analogy.
if
you
went
back
to
a
court
and
the
court
concluded
it
had,
indeed,
been
duped,
you'd
probably
then
have
a
private
lawsuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
you
don't
think
there
would
be
a
private
lawsuit,
even
after
the
fda
came
to
the
conclusion
that
indeed--
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is,
but
in
ordinary
tort
law
the
third
party
who
has
been
defrauded
does
not
have
the
power
to
say
authoritatively
in
any
sense,
i
have
not
been
defrauded.
it
will
be
up
to
the
court
to
say
whether
he's
been
defrauded
or
not.
but
here
the
alleged
defraudee
is
a
federal
agency
that
is
empowered
to
decide
authoritatively
whether
it's
been
defrauded
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
you
get
a
judicial
determination
that
in
fact
the
fda
has
been
defrauded,
does
that
have
any
effect
on
the
fda's
approval
for
the
marketing
of
this
device?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
win
this
suit,
and
the
basis
for
your
winning
it
is
a
determination
by
the
court
that
the
fda
has
been
defrauded.
does
the
fda
have
to
withdraw
the
medical
device
from
the
market?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
produces
a
very
crazy
system,
doesn't
it,
where
you
have
a
bunch
of
state
courts
going
around
saying
that
the
fda
has
been
defrauded
and
has
been
duped
into
approving
this
and
the
fda
continuing
to
allow
it
to
go
out
there?
why
would
we
want
a
system
that
allows
these
contrary
authoritative
determinations
to
bounce
around?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
no,
you
can't
say
that,
that
it
wasn't
a
truthful
reflection
of
the
intended
marketing.
i
think
it's
been
conceded
by
mr.
geller
that
if
they
marketed
this
for
the
use
that
you
claimed
harmed
your
clients
they
would
have
been
in
violation,
wouldn't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
isn't
a
matter
of
what's
the
intended
marketing.
the
issue
is
what
is
the
intended
use.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
intended
use,
according
to
mr.
geller,
is
a
term
of
art,
which
means
the
use
for
which
you
want
fda
approval.
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
fraud
on
them.
i
mean,
once
you
have
a
false...
you
made
a
false
statement
in
a
filing
that
you
know
is
going
to
be
presented
to...
in
a
prospectus
that
you
know
is
going
to
be
presented
to
buyers,
that's
fraud
on
them,
but
this
is
not
fraud
on
your
clients.
i
mean,
this
is
quite
a
different
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
another
example
besides
the
sec
filings,
which
are,
of
course,
meant
to
be
presented
to
the
investors
and
therefore
constitute
fraud
on
the
investors
themselves?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
fishbein,
even
if
you
say
in
this
case
the
agency
hasn't
ruled
yea
or
nay
on
the
particular
facts
here,
do
you
have
at
least
some
other
case
where
the
fda,
which
has
this
authority
to
find
that
it
has
been
defrauded,
has
withdrawn
something
from
the
market
or
has
imposed
some
other
penalty
because
the
application
did
not
contain
uses
that
were
anticipated,
although
they
were
not
set
forth
in
the
application?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
that's
significant?
doesn't
it
tend
to
support
mr.
geller's
contention
that
all
the
fda
cares
about
is
what
use
do
you
want
authority
to
market
for,
and
so
long
as
you
set
forth
that
use,
you'll
have
authority
to
market
for
it,
and
anything
else,
you
may
anticipate
it's
going
to
be
used
for
other
things,
but
that's
all
we're
approving,
is
this
marketed
use?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
intend
to
market
it
for
that
use,
and
there
is
no
allegation
here
that
it
was
marketed
for
anything
except
the
approved
uses.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
a
contest
on
that
point,
as
to
whether
it
was
marketed
improperly.
mr.
geller
says
it
wasn't.
your
cite
says
it
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
geller,
i
don't
understand
one
thing
about
your
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
want
to
eat
up
your
time,
but
do
you
contend
that
your
client
must...
that
a
bona
fide
intended
use
is
at
least
an
intended
use
that
you
intend
to
market?
do
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
is
bona
fide--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
don't
even
have
to
intend
to
market
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
bona
fide
mean,
then?
