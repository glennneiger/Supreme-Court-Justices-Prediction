mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
we're
here
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act,
or
the
medical
device
amendments
to
that
act,
prevent
the
states
from
recognizing
and
awarding
damages
for...
which
flow
from
allowing
a
device
to
enter
the
market
through
fraud
on
the
fda.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
the
answer
to
that
question
comes
from
the
unanimous...
the
unanimous
portions
of
this
court's
decision
in
medtronic.
in
medtronic
the
court
was
confronted
with
the
question
about
whether
or
not
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
and
the
medical
amendments
to
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
preempt
state
common
law
claims
which
are
founded
on
a
violation
of
federal
requirements,
and
what
the
court
said,
and
said
so
unanimously,
was
that
there
is
nothing
in
federal
law
which
prevented
the
states
from
affording
a
private
damage
remedy,
one
not
given
by
federal
law
at
all,
for
violations
of
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act,
or
the
medical
device
amendments
to
that
act,
and
that
was
not
limited
to
negligence
cause
of
actions.
it
was
focused
on
violations
of
the
act.
in
the
present
case,
our
claim
does
not
derive
from
some
newfangled
principle
of
tort
law.
out
claim
derives
from
a
longstanding
principle
of
tort
law
which
has
been
in
force
in
this
country,
in
the
states,
in
various
forms
since
they
became
states,
and
that
is
the
principle
reflected
in
section
536
and
557(a)
of
the
restatement
of
torts
second--
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
--i
don't
believe
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
say
that
for
this
reason.
the
tort
law
does
not
only
go
to
negligence
per
se,
but
tort
law
says
that
where
one
is
required
to
file,
furnish,
or
publish
information
by
statute
or
regulation
for
the
protection
of
the
public,
and
makes
a
misrepresentation
in
doing
so
and
harm
follows
from
that,
that
you're
entitled
to
recover
damages.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
that
is
true--
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
--you're
entitled
to
recover
damages
from
the
maker
of
the
misrepresentation,
because
that
is
where
the
culpable
conduct
lies.
now,
of
course,
it's
true
that
that
principle
is
not
frequently
invoked,
because
in
many
cases
it's
easier
to
go
more
directly
through
other
tort
principles,
but
that
doesn't
change
the
fact
that
that
is
a
principle
of
tort
law
which
is
independent
of
the
federal
scheme.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
i
agree
with
that
statement,
justice
scalia,
and
i
think
that
one
of
the
important
distinctions
here
is
that
this
agency
never
said
one
way
or
the
other
whether
they
had
been
defrauded.
there
has
never
been
a
factual
finding,
either
in
connection
with
the
510(k)
clearance
premarket
notification
or
subsequently,
in
which
the
fda
say
we
either
were
or
were
not
defrauded,
but
if
there
was--
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
--i
would
agree
with
you.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
i
think
that
that
presents
a
more
difficult
question
to--
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
--i
would
argue,
your
honor,
even
under
those
circumstances,
unless
we
were
party
to
the
adjudication,
or
that
was
made
through
a
formal
notice
and
comment
proceeding,
that
we
were
not
bound
by
that.
however,
i
believe
that
at
least
in
that
circumstance
there's
the
argument
that
allowing
a
jury
to
find
a
contrary
fact
cuts
against
what
the
fda
decided.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
you
mean
in
private
litigation,
justice
scalia,
or--
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
--no,
your
honor,
and
that's
one
of
the
points
that
we
make
here,
is
that--
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
--your
honor,
i
think
we
have
such
a
system.
indeed,
it's
common
in
our
system.
just
to
use
a
basic
analogy,
if
i
could,
the
state
establishes
a
law
saying
you
can't...
we're
going
to
put
a
stop
light
up
at
the
corner,
and
you
can't
run
the
stop
light.
the
state
has
the
power
to
enforce
that
through
criminal
sanctions
and
administrative
sanctions.
you
run
through
the
stop
light,
the
state
can
either
choose
or
not
choose
to
prosecute
you,
they
can
choose
or
not
choose
what
remedy
to
afford,
but
there's
no
doubt,
we
all
know
this
from
our
basic
tort
law,
that
the
injured
individual,
notwithstanding
the
potential
exercise
of
state
power,
has
the
right
to
go
into
court
and
recover
damages
for
that
violation.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
a
determination
was
ever
made
that
the
device
should
not
be
kept
on
the
market,
and
i
think
that
goes
to
what's
involved
in
a
so
called
510(k)
clearance.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
and
the
point
i
want
to
make
here
is
simply
this.
when
the
fda
receives
a
510(k)
notification
it
has
to
determine...
it
only
has
the
power,
not
to
clear
the
device
for
the
market
or
not
clear
the
device
for
the
market.
under
21
c.f.r.
section...
i
think
it's
807.100,
the
fda
has
three
choices
when
it
gets
a
510(k)
market,
premarket
notification.
it
can
either
say
that
the
device
is
substantially
equivalent
to
a
predicate
device
for
the
use
intended
by
the
applicant,
it's
not
substantially
equivalent,
or
it
can
ask
for
more
information.
now,
what
the
fda
did
here
was
exactly
what
they
typically
do.
they
looked
at
the
proposed
labeling
they
were
given,
which
was
not
accurate
labeling
because
it
was
not
truthful
reflection
of
the
intended
marketing
for
this
device,
which
is
required
under
the
regulations,
but
the
applicant--
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
--yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
i
agree
with
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
i
disagree
with
that,
justice
scalia,
and
i
think
that
it's
clear,
and
the
government
agrees
with
this
position,
that
intended
use
not
only
in
this
section
of
the
statute
but
every
other
place
is
defined
objectively
by
the
manner
in
which
the
proponent
of
the
device
intends
to
characterize
the
device
in
the
market.
and
i
think
it's
significant
that
in
the
regulations
governing
510(k)
disclosure...
i
believe
it's
807.87(e)
of
title
21,
or
of
21
c.f.r....
what
the
fda
says
is,
don't
just
give
us
the
label
that's
going
to
accompany
this
product.
you
are
obliged
to
give
us
labeling
sufficient
to
describe
the
intended
use
of
the
device,
and
labeling
through
a
series
of
case
law
and
decisions
says
that
it
is
not
only...
and
in
your
decision
in
cordell,
in
fact,
it
is
not
only
what
is
on
the
product,
it
is
the
promotional
materials
which
accompany
the
product
which
demonstrate
how
the
product
will
be
characterized
in
the
marketplace
which
determine
intended
use,
and
that
is
consistent
with
the
legislative
scheme.
congress--
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
--frequently
they
are,
justice
ginsburg.
in
this
case
they
were
not,
and
my
point
is
simply
that
it
is
not
sufficient
to
come
to
the
fda
and
say,
here
is
a
screw,
i'm
going
to
use
this
as
a
screw
to
build
crutches,
when
you
know
darned
well
that
you're
never
going
to
characterize
it
that
way
in
the
market.
it's
not
a
crutch
screw,
it's
a
bone
screw,
and--
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
--i
believe
that
there
is,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think,
in
fact,
your
opinion
in
medtronic,
at
least
the
unanimous
portion,
says
that
private
plaintiffs
can
rely
upon
violations
of
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
law
if
they
can
otherwise
do
so
under
state
law
to
recover
damages.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
i
believe
in
the
securities
area
there
is,
your
honor.
i
can't
cite
the
case,
but
your...
this
court's
recognized--
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
--sure.
where
you
have
a
false
filing
with
the
sec
and
people
purchase
in
reliance
on
the
false
information
contained
in
that
filing,
i
think
it
is
actually
a
statutory
cause
of
action.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
it
is
not
fraud
on
our
clients,
justice
scalia,
but
the
common
law
does
not
require
as
a
tort
matter
fraud
on
the
clients.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
there
was
a
case,
an
important
case
decided
by
the
third
circuit,
not
by
you,
by
justice
becker,
called
stanton
by
brooks
v.
astro
pharmaceutical,
which
held
in
the
early
1980's
that
the
failure
to
discharge
duties
of
disclosure
in
connection
with
a
drug
or
device
rendered
the
product
defective
per
se
under
section
402
of
the
restatement,
and
allowed
a
court
to
award
damages
based
on
the
theory
that
the
fda,
had
they
received
appropriate
disclosures,
would
have
acted
differently
and
would
have
protected
the
plaintiff
from
injury
and
therefore
which
allowed
recovery.
there
are
also
other
appellate
cases
within
the
appellate
system
which
are
cited
in
our
brief,
learjet
v.
spindlauer,
which
i
think
is
a
fifth
circuit
case,
and
there
are
a
few
others
which
recognize...
and
that
case
was
an
aviation
case,
where
a
fraudulent...
a
license
was
obtained
fraudulently
from
the
faa,
also
a
case
called
hawkins,
cited
in
our
briefs,
where
the...
again
a
federal
court
case,
an
appellate
case,
where
the
court
recognized
that
that
kind
of
misrepresentation
changes
the
whole
regulatory
calculus,
deprives
the
public
of
an
informed
decision
with
respect
to
the
product,
and
that
could
render
the
product
dangerous
and
people
can
recover
based
on
that.
so
there
is
a
recognition
both
in
the
common
law
of
that,
and
what
i
would
suggest
is
that
in
medtronic,
both
explicitly
and
as
a
matter
of
implied
preemption
which
is
not
dealt
with
directly
in
medtronic,
that
states
are
not
foreclosed
from
doing
that,
because
there
is
no
impact
here
on
any
function
with
which
the
fda
is
entrusted.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
your
opinion,
justice
breyer,
was
the
one
opinion
which
didn't
go
off
on
the
distinction
between
remedies
and
requirements
and
the
state--
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
--well--
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
--no,
there
wouldn't
be.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
no.
i
would
have
a
different
reason
for
that,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
i
would
advance
for
that--
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
--is
that
in
that
particular
circumstance
the
failure
to
follow
federal
law
was
not
something
that
had
to
do
with
the
safety
of--
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
--there's
a
couple
of
embedded
questions
in
there,
your
honor.
one,
i
do
believe
it's
a
traditional
principle
of
tort
law,
not
as
a
matter
of
implying
cause
of
action
but
as
a
matter
of
negligence
per
se,
or
liability
per
se,
that
where
somebody
violates
a
statute
or
regulation,
regardless
of
who's
in
charge
of
administering
that
statute
or
regulation
intended
for
the
protection
of
the
public,
any
harm
caused
by
that
is
actionable
under
state
law,
not
because
you're
implying
a,
in
the
case
of
federal
law
a
federal
cause
of
action,
but
just
as
a
matter
of
negligence
per
se.
so
the
question
then
is,
is
this
a
substantive
safety
regulation
that
we're
talking
about
here,
or
is
it
a
procedural
regulation,
and
i
say
it's
a
substantive
safety
regulation,
because
the
heart
of
the
federal
scheme,
and
there's
hundreds
of
cases
on
this
regulating
food,
drug,
and
cosmetics,
is,
you
are
only
regulating
by...
with
respect
to
what
the
device
or
drug
is,
and
that
is
a
function
of
two
things,
both
what
it
physically
is
and
what
it's
conceived
to
be
for
marketing
purposes,
and
if
you
misrepresent
to
the
public
what
it
is,
or
you
misrepresent
to
the
agency
what
it
is,
you're
undermining
the
central
safety
aspects
here.
for...
it's
easy
to
see
that
in
this
case,
because
when
the
agency
was
told
this
was
a
spinal
fixation
device
and
that
that's
what
it
was,
they
said,
you
can't
put
that
on
the
market.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
we
don't
know
here
whether
they
think
it's
serious
or
not,
so
that's
the
first
point,
but
more
fundamentally,
insofar
as
the
remedies
that
you've
enumerated
are
concerned,
i
do
believe
that
the
fda
has
exclusive
prosecutorial
discretion.
i
do
think
that
section
337
of
title
21
does
preempt
the
ability
of
states
to
give,
for
example,
injunctive
relief,
civil
penalties,
and
to
suspend
somebody's
license
to
sell
these
products.
i
agree
with
all
that.
but
what
the
federal
law
doesn't
give,
and
what
congress
reserved
to
the
states
when
it
passed
the
federal
law,
it
doesn't
give
anybody
the
ability
to
compensate
the
victims
that
i
represent
for
the
damages
that
he's
sustained
as
a
result
of
the
fraud.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
your
honor,
they
made
no
such
determination
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
i
disagree
that
it's
the
same
as
getting
rid
of
the
product.
what
happened
is,
the
product
as
bone
screws
entered
the
market,
i
say
unlawfully.
now,
if
the
fda
has
not
revoked
the
510(k)
clearance
it's
because
the
product
is
still
legitimately
on
the
market
as
a
bone
screw
product.
the
problem
is
here,
we
have
an
illegitimate
pretextual
application
which
the
government
concedes
was
pretextual
and
would
be
improper
if
the
facts
we
allege
are
true.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
the
f...
we
have
gone
to
the
fda
and
they
have
not
ruled
yea
or
nay,
and
i
believe
that
their
brief
concedes
that
they
have
not
made
a
determination
as
to
the
lawfulness
of
this
conduct
in
any
context,
both
when
the
application
was
received
by
them,
or
subsequently,
and
they
take
the
position
that
when
someone
applies
for
510(k)
clearance
they
cannot
simply
list
a
use,
an
intended
use,
in
quotes,
which
is
pretextual.
the
government's
position,
and
i
think
it's
right,
is
that
the
use
must
be
bona
fide.
you
must
intend,
the
product
must
have
an
intended
use,
meaning
you
intend
to
characterize
it
in
the
market
for
that
use.
now,
true--
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
--the
doctrine
of
exhaustion
i
think
does
not
apply
here,
because
that
presupposes
that
the
agency
has
the
power
to
give
a
remedy
that
the
plaintiffs
want
and
in
this
case
that
would
be
damages,
and
the
agency
clearly
does
not
have
that
power.
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction
is
a
doctrine
which
enables
a
court
to
make
a
referral
to
an
agency
to
make
a
determination
of
some
issue
of
fact
that's
germane
to
the
case.
of
course,
nobody
asked
for
such
a
referral
here
and,
looking
at
your
recent
case,
southwest
marine,
inc.
v.
gissone
and
rider
v.
cooper,
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
there
was
no
primary
jurisdiction
asserted
in
those
cases,
one,
for
example,
whether
someone
had
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers
compensation
act
status
or
seaman
status,
that
was
not
to
be
referred
to
the
agency
there,
that
this
seemed
to
me
to
be
an
inappropriate
case
for
the
exercise
of
primary
jurisdiction.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
i
know
of
no
such
case,
justice
scalia,
but
that's
not
our
position.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
but
justice
scalia,
that's
not
the
agency's
position
and
that's
not
what
its
regulations
say.
they
say
that
you
must
furnish
the
agency
with
a
bona
fide
intended
use,
not
a
pretextual
one,
meaning
that
at
least
as
to
the
use
that
you're
listing
to
the
agency,
you
intend
to
characterize
that
device
in
the
marketplace
in
that
manner.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
that's
not
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
the
allegation
to
the
complaint
here
and
the
factual
support
here
indicate
that
this
device
was
never,
never
marketed
for
long
bone
use.
it
was
only
marketed
for
spinal
application,
and
it
was
marketed...
in
fact,
the
president
of
acromed
within
a
few
days
of
this
clearance
told
somebody
that
this
was...
their
application
to
the
fda
was
a
labeling
sleight
of
hand
which
in
no
way
changes
the
intended
use
of
the
product.
there
virtually
is
fraud
conceded
here
by
virtue
of
the
circumstances.
it's
an
unusual
circumstance,
i
grant.
there's
not
too
many
people
that
would
be
this
brazen,
but
that's
what
happened
here.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
it
was
not
marketed
properly.
it
was...
in
fact,
it
was...
we
contend
that
this
fraud
did
not
occur
by
itself
but
occurred
as
part
of
a
deal,
or
a
concocted
scheme
between
buckman
and
acromed
as
a
two
step
process.
first,
they
couldn't
get
it
on
the
market
as
a
pedical
screw
fixation
device,
which
is
all
it
ever
was.
so
they
lied
to
the
fda,
then
they
got
clearance,
meaning,
it
was
found
substantially
equivalent
for
long
bone
use,
but
they
knew
they
were
going
to
market
it
the
second
it
got
approved
for...
not
for
long
bone
use.
there's
not
a
person
in
the
united
states
that
ever
received
this,
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
for
long
bone
application,
and--
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
--the
answer
to
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
is,
as
to
buckman,
no.
as
to
other
defendants,
yes,
but
as
to
other
defendants,
why
would
we
bring
buckman
in
this
if
we
had
other
solvent
defendants?
the
principal
defendant
here
was
acromed
corporation.
acromed
corporation
was
basically
insolvent
with
respect
to
this
liability
and
we
ended
up
settling
our
claims
against
acromed
on
a
limited--
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
--they
have
additional
assets,
that's
correct,
and
we
are
attempting
to
try
to
recover
for
our
clients
all
the
damages
to
which
they're
legally
entitled.
i
suspect
even
buckman
does
not
have
sufficient
assets,
because
this
fraud
and
its
consequences
were
so
widespread
and
caused
so
much
injury
that
there's
simply
not
enough
money
with
the
potential
culpable
defendants.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
i
disagree
with
that,
justice
o'connor,
and
here's
why.
the
fda
did
nothing
wrong,
or
nothing
that
needs
to
be
second
guessed.
they
were
told...
if
we
look
at
page
58
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
fda
asked
buckman,
what
is
the
intended
use
of
this
device?
page
58
is
a
letter
from
buckman
back
to
the
fda,
because
the
fda
had
reviewed
this
and
seen
it
was
a
spinal
device
before.
now
it's
being
presented
as
a
long
bone
device,
and
mr.
shlerf
of
buckman
said,
for
purposes
of
this
510(k),
this
is
a
long
bone
fixation
device,
and
as
a
long
bone
fixation
device,
the
fda
was
correct
in
determining
that
there
were
predicate
devices
on
the
market
which
had
the
same
technical
characteristics
as
this
device,
and
it
was
okay.
there's
nothing
about
our
claim
that
would
require
a
jury
to
say
the
fda
was
wrong.
in
fact--
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
actually,
it's
enforcing
what
the
fda
had
previously
determined
on
two
occasions,
one
of
which
was
about
3
or
4
months
before
that.
the
fda
made
a
specific
determination
that
these
devices
were
not
substantially
equivalent
for
pedical
screw
use
or
spinal
use
twice,
and
the
consequence
of
that
was
that
they
didn't
belong
in
the
market.
so
what
we're
doing
here
is
simply
vindicating
an
explicit
regulatory
determination
made
to
protect
persons
in
the
position
of
the
plaintiff
from
the
kind
of
harm
that
occurred
here.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
government's
authority
is
in
its
capacity
to
protect
the
public
through
the
remedies
given
to
it,
and
my
contention
is,
and
i
think--
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
--i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
the
government
has
no
power
to
limit
the
availability
of
damage
relief
and
that
congress
did
not
want
it
to
limit
the
availability
of
damage
relief.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
oh,
if
congress
said
no
damages?
there's
no
question
that
congress
has
the
power
to
do
that.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
i
think,
your
honor,
that
silkwood
basically
answers
that
question
both
in
terms
of
the
majority
and
the
dissent
in
silkwood,
which
said
that
there
is
an
independence
here
of
regulatory
restraint
and
damage
recovery
which
can
and
should
and
must
peacefully
coexist
with
one
another,
so
that
the
fda,
or
in
that
case
the
nuclear
regulatory
authorities,
regulate...
from
a
public
regulatory
standpoint
they
do
what
they
do
and
the
state
courts
administer
a
remedy
system
which
may,
in
fact,
have
penal
aspects
to
it,
because
in
silkwood,
remember,
there
was
an
award
of
punitive
damages.
we're
not
asking
for
that
here.
so
i
think
that
the
two
can
peacefully
coexist,
and
it's
up
to
the
state
system
applying
state
rules...
there
are
some
states
that
would
not
allow
us
to
recover
here,
but
there
are
many
others
that
would,
and
there's...
i
think
what
congress
made
clear
in
enacting
both
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
and
the
medical
device
amendments
to
that
act,
was
that
empowering
the
fda
to
have
certain
nondamage
remedies
should
not
usurp
the
state's
power
to
provide
remedies
for
people
who
are
hurt.
mr.
michael
d.
fishbein
thank
you,
your
honor.
