we'll

argument
now
in

98-1768,
the
buckman
company
v.
the
plaintiffs'
legal
committee.
mr.

chief

william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
geller.
mr.
gornstein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief

william
h.

very
well,
mr.
gornstein.
mr.
fishbein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
that's
an
extraordinary...
this
is
an
extraordinary
application
of
that
principle.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
from
whom?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
from
whom?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
fda--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--if...
supposing
the
fda
had
opened
the
matter
up,
said
we
find
we
weren't
defrauded,
would
you
then
have
no
claim?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
asking
you
to
fish
or
cut
bait,
so
to
speak.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
also
something
of
an
interloper.
i
mean,
under
the
government's
view
the
fda
has
various
authorities
to
follow
this
thing
up
and
may
choose
not
to
follow
it
up.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
government's
authority
is
also
to
limit
those
remedies
if
it
so
chooses.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
say
congress
didn't
intend
to
limit
damages
you're
probably
right,
but
the
government...
assuming
if
congress
felt
otherwise
it
would
be
true,
too.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fishbein.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
geller,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
geller.
the
case
is
submitted.

rehnquist
the
second
case,
i
have
to
announce
is
no.
98-1768,
buckman
co.
versus
the
plaintiffs'
legal
committee.
here
the
respondent
represents
plaintiffs
who
claimed
injuries
resulting
from
the
use
of
orthopedic
bone’s
screws
in
the
pedicles
of
their
spines.
petitioner
is
a
consulting
company
that
assisted
the
screws'
manufacturer
in
navigating
the
federal
regulatory
process
for
these
devices.
the
plaintiffs’
claim
the
petitioner
statement
to
the
food
and
drug
administration
or
fda
as
to
the
intended
use
of
the
use
of
these
screws
fraudulently
induced
the
fda
to
give
market
approval
and
ultimately
led
to
plaintiffs’
injuries.
the
district
court
concluded
that
these
state
law
so-called
fraud
on
the
fda
claims
were
improper
under
the
medical
device
amendments
to
the
federal
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
acts
or
the
mda,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
reversed
that
decision,
saying
that
there
was
no
express
or
implied
conflict
between
the
plaintiffs’
claims
and
the
mda.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse.
under
the
supremacy
clause
united
states
constitution,
state
law
claims
have
conflict
with
the
federal
statute
are
invalid
under
what
is
known
as
the
implied
preemption
doctrine.
the
plaintiffs
fraud
on
the
fda
claims
create
such
a
conflict
with
the
regulatory
regime
established
by
the
mda.
the
bones
screws
at
issue
here
were
introduced
under
a
provision
of
the
mda,
directing
the
fda
to
approve
devices
that
it
determines,
are
substantially
equivalent
to
a
device
that
is
already
on
the
market.
referred
to
as
the
510(k)
process,
this
exception
to
the
fda’s
more
time
consuming
in
normal
processes
prevents
unnecessary
delay
in
the
development
of
competition
among
medical
device
manufactures.
the
510(k)
process
sets
forth
a
comprehensive
scheme
for
deciding
whether
an
applicant’s
device
qualifies.
the
process
also
includes
various
provisions
aimed
at
detecting,
deterring,
and
punishing
false
statements.
the
statute
makes
clear
that
it
is
the
fda’s
responsibility
not
that
of
private
litigants
to
issue
a
measured
response
to
incidence
of
non-compliance.
the
fda
is
charged
with
achieving
a
variety
of
difficult
and
often
competing
statutory
objectives
and
it
would
inevitably
forth
that
task
if
plaintiffs
at
each
of
the
50
states,
were
able
to
bootstraps
state
tort
claims
under
the
federal
regulatory
regime.
both
manufacture’s
willingness
to
participate
in
the
approval
process
and
their
conduct
within
that
regime
would
be
skewed
by
fears
of
unpredictable
state
litigation.
this
would
interfere
with
the
fda’s
own
judgment
is
to
how
best
to
achieve
the
statute’s
goal.
the
conflict
between
the
mda
and
plaintiffs’
fraud
on
the
fda
claims
dictates
that
the
latter
are
impliedly
preempted.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
thomas
joins.
