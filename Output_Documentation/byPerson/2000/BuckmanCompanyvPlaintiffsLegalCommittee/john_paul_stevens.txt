mr.
geller,
suppose
the
case
was
one
in
which
the
fda
decided
that
the
misrepresentation,
assuming
there
was
one,
was
sufficient
to
justify
taking
it
off
the
market.
would
a
person
who
was
injured
during
the
period
it
was
on
the
market
have
any
remedy
at
all,
either
state
or
federal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
the
federal
agency
might
have
found
there
was,
in
fact,
exactly
the
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
would
you
give
the
same
answer
mr.
geller
did?
assume
the
fda
concluded
that
its
processes
had
been
corrupted
by
the
acts
of
fraud,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
is
there
any
way
the
fda
could
give
a
remedy
to
people
who
were
injured
by
that
fraud?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean,
there
would
not
be
a
remedy
for
the
fraud?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
category
of
people
who
might
exist...
i'm
not
suggesting
that's
this
case,
but
who
might
have
been
injured
by
that
fraud
would
have
absolutely
no
remedy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i...
they're
preempted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
going
further.
you're
saying
even
if
they
did
find
it
was
procured
by
fraud,
there
would
still
be
preemption.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
example
is
quite
different.
can
i
just
suggest
why,
and
i
would
really
like
you
to
focus
on
it.
here,
your
claim
is
not
only
that
they
were
defrauded,
but
that
the
fraud
was
sufficiently
serious,
that's
responsible
for
the
item
being
on
the
market,
and
so
if
they
keep
the
item
on...
say
the
fda
had
an
investigation,
you
had
a
jury,
everybody
agreed
there
was
fraud,
but
everybody
also
agreed
the
fraud
was
not
sufficiently
serious
to
take
the
item
off
the
market,
it
was
kind
of
immaterial,
that's
quite
a
different
case
from
the
red
light
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
no.
it's
involved
in
your
lawsuit,
as
i
understand
it.
one
of
the
steps
in
the
sort
of,
the
change
of
causation
is
that
in
your
argument...
your
complaint,
if
i
understand,
is,
but
for
the
fraud,
this
item
would
not
be
on
the
market.
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
