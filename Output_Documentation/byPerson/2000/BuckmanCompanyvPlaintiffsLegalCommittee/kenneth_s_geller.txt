mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
people
who
underwent
back
surgery
in
which
particular
medical
devices
were
used.
they
brought
this
suit
under
state
law
to
recover
for
injuries
allegedly
caused
by
their...
by
these
devices,
but
this
is
a
very
unusual
form
of
state
law
product
liability
action.
the
plaintiffs
don't
claim
that
these
devices
were
in
any
way
defective.
there's
no
claim
here
of
manufacturing
defect.
there's
no
claim
here
of
design
defect.
the
plaintiffs
also
don't
claim
that
the
surgeons
who
used
these
devices
did
anything
wrong.
there's
no
claim
here
of
medical
malpractice.
instead,
the
plaintiffs'
sole
claim
in
this
case
is
the
following.
they
assert
that
the
federal
food
&
drug
administration
was
deceived
into
giving
regulatory
clearance
to
these
devices,
that,
absent
this
deception,
these
devices
would
never
have
been
on
the
market,
and
that,
if
the
devices
had
never
have
been
on
the
market,
they
wouldn't
have
been
used
in
their
surgeries
and
they
wouldn't
have
suffered
any
injuries.
so
this
lawsuit
is,
in
other
words,
a
direct
attack
under
state
law
on
the
decision
of
the
federal
food
&
drug
administration
applying
federal
law
to
allow
these
devices
to
be
marketed
in
interstate
commerce
and,
if
this
suit
is
allowed
to
proceed,
it
means
that
a
jury
applying
state
law
would
have
to
decide
such
issues
as,
what
sorts
of
disclosures
have
to
be
made
to
the
food
&
drug
administration
in
the
context
of
seeking
510(k)
approval
for
a
device?
what
did
the
fda
know
about
these
specific
devices
and
their
intended
use?
was
the
fda
deceived
in
any
way
in
granting
regulatory
clearance?
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
justice
souter,
they
would
have
to
do
that
because
there's
a
fraud
claim
and
if
you
look
at
the
complaint--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--it
would--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--it
would
be
more
than
that,
justice
souter.
if
you
look
at
the
complaint,
for
example,
at
page
21
of
the
joint
appendix,
paragraphs
131
and
132
allege
not
only
that
a
false
statement
was
made
but
reliance
and
causation
and
all
the
things
that
you
have
to
prove
in
order
to
prove
a
state
law
cause,
state
law
fraud
action.
so
it's
not
enough
simply
to
prove
that
a
misrepresentation
was
made
in
order
to
recover
on
it.
you
would
also
have
to
prove
whether
the
misrepresentation
was
material,
whether
the
fda
knew
what
was
allegedly
not
told
to
it,
whether
the
fda
thought
that
it
was
relying
on
the
absence
of
the
information,
relied
on
the
misrepresentation
and
then
finally,
what
would
the
fda
have
done
if
it
had
been
told
the
truth,
the
causation
theory.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
your
honor,
the...
what
the
manufacturer
has
to
show
in
seeking
510(k)
is,
in
addition
to
showing
that
the
device
has
the
physical
technological
characteristics
of
the
predicate
device
the
manufacturer
also
has
to
put
down
what
the
intended
use
of
the
device
is.
it's...
the
manufacturer
under
the
law
is
entitled
to
put
down
any
intended
use
it
wants,
as
described
in
the
labeling.
what
the
plaintiffs
seem
to
claim
here
is
that
the
fda,
is
that
the
manufacturer
had
to
allege
not
simply
that
the
intended
use
was
for
the
long
bones,
which
was
the
manufacturer
was
entitled
to
allege,
but
also,
according
to
the
complaint,
that
once
the
device
got
on
the
market
the
manufacturer
intended
that
it
be
used
for
spinal
applications,
and
that
our...
and
therefore
a
state
jury
would
have
to
determine
what
would
the
fda
have
done,
if
it
had
been
told,
as
the
plaintiffs
allege
the
manufacturer
should
have
told
the
fda,
that
once
this
device
gets
on
the
market
the
intent
was
to
see
it
used
significantly
for
spinal
applications.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
well,
i
think
the
opposite,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
it
shows
that
the
fda
was
well
aware
of
the
possibility
of
using
these
devices
for
spinal
applications
and
when
the
manufacturer
came
in,
as
it
was
entitled
to
do,
and
that
now
we
want
to
seek
510(k)
approval
to
label
these
devices
for
the
long
bones
of
the
arm
and
leg,
the
fda
was
well
aware
that
the
devices
had
some
possibility
of
being
used
for
spinal
applications.
after
all,
i
think
the
mistake
here--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--absolutely,
what
did
the
fda
actually
know
about
the
use
of
these
devices,
and
that's
in
our
view
not
an
inquiry
that
should
be
made
under
state
law.
in
fact,
one
of
the--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--in
effect,
although
whether
it
was
even
a
fraud
at
all...
you
see,
i
think
one
of
the
problems
here
is
in
viewing
the
intended
use
statement
under
510(k)
as
a
factual
representation
at
all.
it's
not
a
factual
representation
at
all.
it's
simply
a
request
for
marketing
clearance.
the
manufacturer
decides
by
its
labeling
what
sort
of
marketing
clearance
it
seeks
for
its
devices.
the
fda's
role
is
simply
to
look
at
the
labeling
and
determine
whether
there
was
a
device
on
the
market
prior
to
1976
with
those
physical
characteristics
and
that
labeling.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
absolutely,
justice
scalia.
i
think
intended
use
is
a
misnomer.
it's
a
term
of
art
in
the
food
and
drug
law,
and
i
think
the
statute
and
the
regulations
are
as
clear
as
can
be,
it
is
simply
a
request
for
marketing
clearance
by
describing
how
you
intend
to
label
your
device.
it
is
not
at
all
a
factual
representation
as
to
how
that
device
will
actually
be
used
off
label
once
the
device
is
on
the
market,
which
is,
i
think,
one
of
the
many
problems
with
the
plaintiffs'
claim
here.
but
the
point
that
i
was
simply
making
is
the
sorts
of
inquiries
that
a
state
judge
or
jury
would
have
to
make
if
this
state
law
claim
were
allowed
to
proceed
are
inquiries
that
would
delve
heavily
into
the
intricacies
of
the
federal
regulatory
process
and,
in
addition,
in
addition
to
prevail
on
their
claims
the
plaintiffs
would
have
to
convince
a
state
jury
that
these
devices
should
never
have
been
on
the
market
and
were
not
lawfully
on
the
market,
even
though
the
fda
has
decided
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
that
the
devices
are
lawfully
on
the
market,
so
to
rule
for
plaintiffs,
a
jury
under
state
law
would
have
to
essentially
disregard
and
nullify
a
binding
decision
of
the
fda.
now,
our
position
is
that
a
claim
such
as
this,
which
essentially
amounts
to
an
attack
under
state
law
on
a
binding
determination
by
a
federal
agency
is
both
expressly
and
impliedly
preempted
by
the
federal
food
and
drug
laws.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
no,
i
think--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--that's
a
mis...
i
think
that's
a
misunderstanding--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--justice
souter,
of
the
process.
what
the
fda
does
is
permit
it
to
get
on
the
market,
and
it
can
only
be
marketed
for
long
bone
use.
it
can
only
be
marketed
for
the
intended
use
described
in
the
labeling,
but
once
it's
on
the
market,
it's
quite
clear
that
surgeons
are
entitled,
in
the
exercise
of
their
medical
judgment,
to
use
those
devices
for--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--that's--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--the
fda.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--the
fda
decided
that
these
devices
were
entitled
to
be
on
the
market,
labeled
for
long
bone
use.
there's
no
question
that
they
were
lawfully
at
all
times
on
the
market,
labeled
for
long
bone
use.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
no.
it
means
it
could
only
be--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--no,
your
honor.
it
means
it
can
only
be
marketed
for
long
bone
use.
it
can
be
used
for
any
purpose
whatsoever
once
it
was
on
the
market,
consistent
with
independent
medical
judgment.
the
claim
here--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--but
it
is
not
inconsistent
in
any
way
with
the
fda's
decision.
the
fda
decided
here
that
the...
that
this
510(k)
satisfied
the
statute
in
the
sense
that
the
device
was
similar,
substantially
equivalent
both
in
its
characteristics
and
its
intended
use
to
a
predicate
device.
it
therefore
was
entitled
to
be
on
the
market.
in
fact,
it
had
a
right
to
be
on
the
market.
at
all
times
it
was
lawfully
on
the
market.
the
plaintiffs--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
yes.
the
fda.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--absolutely.
in
fact,
many
drugs
and
devices--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--absolutely.
the
statute
is
quite
clear.
congress
made
it
quite
clear
that
the
fda
has
no
control
over
the
practice
of
medicine.
all
it
does
is
approve
drugs
and
devices
to
be
marketed
for
particular
purposes.
once
they're
on
the
market,
physicians
and
surgeons
are
entitled
to
use
the
devices
for
any
purpose
consistent
with
their
own
medical
judgment,
and
off
label--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--if
that
failed--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--if
that
fails
to
satisfy
some
state
law
duty
of
care.
in
fact,
justice
souter,
you
can
imagine
a
situation
where
a
manufacturer
here
sought
approval
for
these
devices
for
a
purpose
of
labeling
them
for
long
bones,
and
had
absolutely
no
intent
that
they
be
used
for
anything
else,
a
manufacturer
with
a
perfectly
clear
heart
here,
contrary
to
what
they
allege
about
these
defendants.
the
device
would
have
been
on
the
market
in
exactly
the
same
way
these
devices
would
have
been
on
the
market.
the
physicians
and
surgeons
would
have
used
them
in
exactly
the
same
way
these
devices
were
used.
the
plaintiffs
would
have
suffered
exactly
the
same
injuries.
so
the
flaw
here
is
that
these
devices
were
entitled
to
be
on
the
market.
once
the
intended
use
that
was
described
in
the
510(k)
application
was
consistent
with
an
intended
use
for
devices
such
as
these
prior
to
1976--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--okay.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
it
is
consistent--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--my
view,
your
honor,
it...
what
happened
here
was
perfectly
consistent
with
the
fda...
with
the
scheme
and
the
fda's
decision
here.
the
fda's
decision
here
was
that
these
devices
had
a
right
to
be
on
the
market
because
they
satisfied
510(k).
what
happened
thereafter,
it
may
have
been
a
marketing
violation
if
they
were
marketed
for
other
purposes,
but
it
was
in
no
way
a
fraud
on
the
fda,
which
is
the
allegation
here,
to
seek
approval.
it
is
perfectly
lawful...
let
me
say
it
this
way.
it
is
perfectly
lawful,
perfectly
consistent
with
the
statute,
perfectly
protective
of
the
public
health,
to
seek
approval
under
section
510(k)
for
a
device
by
saying
it
has
intended
use
a,
even
though
you
hope,
expect,
intend
that
once
the
device
gets
on
the
market
it
would
be
used
primarily,
or
even
exclusively,
for
use
b.
that's
perfectly
consistent
with
the
federal
statutory
scheme.
now,
what
you
can't
do
is
market
it
for
use
b,
but
it's
perfectly
appropriate,
under
the
statute,
to
represent
to
the
fda
and
put
in
your
labeling
that
it
has
intended
use
a.--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--you
cannot
market
it.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
that's
part
of
the
food
and
drug
laws.
that
may
well
be
misbranded
or
adulterated
if
you
market
it
for
use
b
when
it
only
has
intended
use
a,
but
when
you
do
that
you
violated
the
marketing
regulation.
it's
in
no
way
a
fraud
on
the
fda,
which
is
what
the
allegation
is
here.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
no.
i.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--our
position--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--i
think
it
should
be,
justice
kennedy,
because
congress
ultimately
made
a
decision
that
there
is
not
to
be
a
private
right
of
action
for
violation
of
the
federal
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act,
that
all
violations
of
the
act
or
suspected
violations
are
to
be
enforced
by
the
food
&
drug
administration
in
its
ultimate
discretion.
this
is
section
336
and
337
of
the
act.
the
fda
is
to
decide
whether
there
is
a
violation
and,
if
there
is
a
violation,
the
fda
is
to
decide
whether
it's
a
significant
enough
violation
to
cause
some
sort
of
penalties
to
be
imposed,
and
this
was
a
very,
very
important
part
of
congress'
scheme.
unlike
many
other
regulatory
statutes,
the
securities
laws,
the
antitrust
laws,
congress
here
decided
there
should
not
be
a
private
right
of
action
and
the
reason
is
because
you're
dealing
here
with
the
public
health.
there
may
well
be
misrepresentations
to
the
fda
in
an
application
and
yet
it's
important
to
have
the
device
remain
on
the
market
for
the
public
health.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
well,
obviously
it's
not
this
case,
but--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--i
would
say
no
because
of
the
congress'
decision
not
to
provide...
you
cannot
bring
a
cause
of
action
that
enforces
the
federal
food
&
drug
laws.
now,
there
may
well
be
a
state...
as
in
medtronic--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--absolutely,
because
there's
too
great
a
danger
i
think,
justice
stevens,
that
a
state
court
might
impose
a
remedy
that
is
completely
inconsistent
with
the
remedy
that
the
fda
itself
would
have
decided
was
appropriate
in
that
situation.
and
here,
you
know,
this
is
a...
this
is
the
contrasting
situation,
if
i
could,
and
i'd
like
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal,
but
this
is
a
situation
in
which
all
of
the
allegations
of
so
called
fraud
in
the
plaintiffs'
complaint
here
were
presented
to
the
food
&
drug
administration
not
on
one
occasion
but
on
at
least
two
occasions.
thousands
and
thousands
of
pages
of
documents
that
allegedly
documented
this
fraud
were
presented
to
the
fda
in
a
citizens'
position,
and
when
the
fda
was
reclassifying
bone
screws.
the
fda
decided
not
to
do
anything.
it
obviously
didn't
feel
itself
defrauded.
it
decided
not
to
take
these
devices
in
any
way
off
the
market,
and
yet
the
plaintiffs'
fraud
claim
here
would
have
the
potential
to
completely
undermine
this
entire
statutory
scheme
by
allowing
state
courts
and
juries
to
second
guess
the
decision
of
the
fda
to
allow
these
devices
to
remain
on
the
market
to
protect
the
public
health.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
a
few
things.
first,
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question,
there
is
no
precedent
for
this
cause
of
action.
every
court
of
appeals,
with
the
exception
of
the
court
below,
has
held
that
the
so
called
fraud
on
the
agency
claims
are
preempted.
secondly,
i
want
to
address
medtronic,
which
is
the
centerpiece
of
the
plaintiff's
argument
here.
this
case
is
completely
unlike
medtronic,
in
part
for
some
of
the
reasons
mr.
gornstein
was
getting
into.
medtronic
was
a
garden
variety
product
liability
claim
under
state
law,
design
defect,
failure
to
warn.
there
was
no
requirement
in
medtronic
that
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act
be
construed,
there
was
no
suggestion
that
you
had
to
inquire
into
any
agency
determinations,
there
was
no
fraud
on
the
agency
claim
in
medtronic,
and
there
was
no
claim
of
implied
preemption
in
medtronic.
in
fact,
the
existence
of
medtronic
suggests,
the
decision
in
medtronic
suggests
that
the
plaintiffs
have
many
common
law
claims
available
to
them
if
these
products
were
defective,
so
it's
not
a
case
that
the
court
was
confronted
with
in
medtronic,
where
the
argument
of
preemption
would
have
wiped
out
many
preexisting
state
law
claims.
here,
no
claim...
the
states
would
not
be
ousted
of
any
claim
that
would
have
existed
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
medical
device
amendments
in
this
case.
third,
i
just
want
to
focus
for
the
court's
attention
at,
if
you
look
at
page
136
of
the
joint
appendix
there's
a
strong
suggestion
here
that
what
the
plaintiff's
label
as
fraud
on
the
fda
the
irony
here
is,
actually
was
an
idea
that
originated
with
the
fda
to
break
up
this
one
device
into
its
two
constituent
parts
and
to
seek
510(k)
approval
for
each,
so
the
notion
that
a
state
court
years
later
could
conclude
this
was
a
fraud
on
the
fda
and
enter
a
judgment
that
would...
might
have
the
effect
of
removing
the
device
from
the
market
is
completely
inconsistent,
we
think,
with
congress'
scheme
here,
which
is
to
centralize
enforcement
authority
with
the
fda.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
no.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
no,
there's
absolutely
no
requirement.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
you
do
not
have
to--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--it's
not
our...
it's
not
our
word,
it's
the
plaintiff's
word.
what
you
have...
you're
seeking
approval
to
market
for
a
particular...
for
a
particular
use.
you
can't
market
for
some
other
use,
but
there's
no
requirement
under
the
law
that
you
market
for
that
use.
many
devices
and
drugs
are
on
the
market--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--well,
justice...
if
i
may
answer
the
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
souter
in
making
a
510(k)
application,
you
not
only
have
to
provide
the
intended
use,
you
also
have
to
provide
many
details
about
the
physical
or
technological
characteristics
of
the
device.
there
may
be
test
results
that
are
presented.
there
are
many
occasions
where
you
might
actually
present
fraudulent
information
but
it
doesn't
relate
to
the
intended
use.
