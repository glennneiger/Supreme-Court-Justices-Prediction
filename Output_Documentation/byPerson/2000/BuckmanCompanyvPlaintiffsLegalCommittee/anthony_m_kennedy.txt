justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
it
helps
bring
you
to
the
argument
on
implied
preemption,
which
i'm
anxious
to
hear--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--let
me
just
ask
you
this
question.
suppose
a
consultant
like
your
client
here,
in
assisting
the
labeling
of
a
drug
or
device,
does
not
disclose
a
side
effect,
and
the
side
effect
is
not
on
the
label,
and
somebody's
injured
because
they
have
the
side
effect,
and
the
allegation
is
that
they
knew
about
the
side
effect
and
deliberately
withheld
it.
is
there
a
cause
of
action
under
some
states,
under
this
state?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
there
is
implied
preemption--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
if
so,
why
should
that
be?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
happens
if
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
would
happen
if
an
expert
gave
fraudulent
or
negligent,
two
different
hypotheticals,
information
to
an
attorney,
and
the
attorney
then
made
a
submission
to
the
court,
and
the
court
makes
a
ruling,
and
the
ruling
is
against
the
adversary
party,
can
the
adversary
party
then
sue
the
expert
just
under
state
law,
and
does
this
happen
all
the
time,
or
would
the
courts
have
in...
throughout
the
states
the
same
argument
that
you're
making
here,
oh,
we
don't
want
a
lot
of
satellite
litigation,
we
don't
want
to
be
deluged?
are
there
cases
on
the
books
that
tell
us
about
this,
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--this
theory
hasn't
been
tried?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
excuse
me.
and
if
that
happened,
you
would
not
object
to
a
fraud
suit
at
that
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--under
the
implied
preemption
theory.
