h.

do
they
really
have
to
get
into
all
of
those
issues,
because
i
thought
at
least
one
theory
of
the
plaintiffs'
case
was
simply
representation
as
determined
on
an
objective
basis
and
the
only
thing
the
jury
would
have
to
decide
was
whether,
on
an
objective
basis,
the
representation
that
the
devices
were
intended
for,
what
was
it,
long
bone
surgery,
something
other
than
spinal
surgery,
was
true
or
false?
why
would
they
have
to
go
beyond
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
would
be
a
question
of
intent
on
the
part
of
the
company,
but
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
sorry,
go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
in
effect
that
there
would
be
an
issue
of
whether
the
fda
was
complicit
in
the
deception
itself?
justice
david
h.
souter
we
know...
i
mean,
as
justice
ginsburg's
question
suggests
it
would
be
fairly
easy
to
prove
what
the
fda
knew
about
possible
applications,
but
i
think,
if
i
understand
your
answer
to
her,
your
answer
is,
well,
that
still
doesn't
simplify
the
case,
because
the
issue
then
would
become,
even
on
that
assumption,
did
the
fda
understand
perfectly
well
that
this
fraud
was
nothing
but
a
fraud,
and
they
winked
at
it
and
said,
sure,
this
is
an
easy
way
of
letting
them
do
what
they
want
to
do
even
though
we've
said
before
that
we
won't
let
them
do
it.
in
other
word...
is
that
in
effect
what
you're--
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
geller,
i'm
sorry,
may
i
ask
you
just
to
go
back
one
step,
and
that
is
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
plaintiffs'
cause
of
action
really
is
an
attack,
at
least
on
its
face,
on
an
fda
decision,
because
the
fda
decision,
as
i
understand
it,
is
a
decision
to
allow
the
devices
to
be
marketed
for
the
long
bone
use,
and
their
cause
of
action,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
in
fact,
as
a
result
of
this
lie,
this
fraud
on
the
fda,
it
was,
in
fact,
allowed
to
be
used,
or
it
was
possible
to
use
it,
i
guess
is
the
neutral
word,
on
the
spine.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
is
not
attacking
a
decision
of
the
fda
because,
in
the
sense
that
the
fda,
as
i
understand
it,
says
yeah,
we'll
permit
it
for
the
purposes
of
long
bone
use.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
as
far
as
the
fda
decision
went,
wasn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
it's
true,
and
the
surgeons
are
not
liable
to
the
fda--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
is
it
fair
to
characterize
the
fda
decision
as
being
a
decision
to
permit
it's
use
for
the
spine--
justice
david
h.
souter
--as
opposed
to
permit
its
use
for
the
intended
purpose?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
labeled
for
long
bone
use
means,
doesn't
it,
that
the...
or
implies,
doesn't
it,
that
the
fda's
approval
was
for
long
bone
use--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
only
for
long
bone
use?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
may
not
have
had
a
right
to
go
after
the
doctor
who
used
it
for
some
other
purpose,
but
the
extent
of
the
fda
approval
didn't
go
beyond
long
bones,
did
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
to
the
extent
that
it's
used
for
more
than
long
bones,
hasn't
the
fda
in
effect
washed
its
hands
of
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
think...
i
mean,
i
think
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--get
your
point.
the
only
issue
that
i
was
trying
to
raise
was
how
we
ought
to
characterize
it.
should
we
characterize
it
as...
should
we
characterize
their
intent
as
inconsistent
with
the
fda
approval,
as
distinct
from
consistent
with
a
use
that
the
fda
would
not
affirmatively
take
steps
to
stop,
and
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
characterization
might
have
an
effect
on
the
way
we
view--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
other
words...
i'm
sorry.
in
other
words,
the
fda
can
do
its
own
fraud
prosecution
and
the
fda
can
withdraw
the
drug
from
the
market.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
those
are
the
reasons.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
this
is
not
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
do
we
have
a
fraud
cause
of
action,
as
opposed
to
a
cause...
on
the
part
of
the
agency,
as
opposed
to
a
cause
of
action
for
failing
to
abide
by
the
terms
of
your
regulatory
applications?
