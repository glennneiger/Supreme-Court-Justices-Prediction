mr.
geller,
why
wouldn't
it
be
adequate
to
show
that,
that
there
had
been
two
prior
applications
that
were
rejected
for
use
of
this
device
for
spinal
surgery?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
my
point
was
simply
that
we
do
have
two
applications
that
said
the
intended
use
is
for
spinal
surgery
and
both
of
those
applications
were
turned
down.
isn't
that
enough
to
infer
that
if
they
had
for
a
third
time
said
the
same
thing
they'd
be
turned
down
again?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
the
marketing,
you
can't
market
it
for
use
b.--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that's
part
of
which
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
those
promotional
materials
attached
to
the
application
to
the
fda?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
thing
that
makes
this
case
so
peculiar
is,
a
government
agency,
a
private
attorney
general
coming
in
to
say
that
the
agency
has
been
defrauded.
i
don't
know
of
any
precedent
for
a
private
citizen
coming
in
and
saying,
government
agency,
i'm
going
to
be
your
champion,
you
have
been
defrauded.
it's
not
like
in
the
sec.
the
sec
says,
yeah,
we
need
people
to
help
us
enforce
because
we
can't
go
after
all
those
bad
actors,
quite
different
from
here,
saying,
agency,
you've
been
defrauded,
and
we
private
citizens
are
going
to
decide.
is
there
any
precedent,
anything
like
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
mean
the
fda,
because
as
far
as
i
know
this
is
a
novel
claim.
is
there
any
case
where
citizen
x
has
successfully
maintained
a
claim
for
fraud
on
any
three
or
four
letter
agency
that
you
want
to
pick?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
there's
a
claim
for
fraud
on
the
sec?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
a...
but
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
fishbein,
may
i
stop
you
there--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--because
i
didn't
realize
that
was
the
government's
concession,
and
mr.
geller
told
us
that
there
was
indeed
an
effort
to
go
to
the
fda
to
complain
about
this
and
it
was
unsuccessful.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
shouldn't
there
be
some,
even
a
notion
of...
assuming
that
there
could
be
such
a
complaint
at
all,
of
primary
jurisdiction,
or
exhaustion
or
something,
to
let
the
agency
speak
for
itself?
if
it
doesn't
think
that
it's
been
defrauded,
that
should
be
the
end
of
it.
