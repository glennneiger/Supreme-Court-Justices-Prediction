mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
respondents'
fraud
on
the
fda
claim
is
impliedly
preempted
for
two
reasons.
first,
it
conflicts
with
the
federal
government's
exclusive
authority
to
enforce
the
act's
prohibitions
against
fraud
on
the
fda
and
second,
it
conflicts
with
the
fda's
decision
clearing
the
devices
at
issue
here
for
marketing.
now,
as
to
the
first
point,
the
act
expressly
gives
to
the
federal
government
exclusive
authority
to
enforce
the
act's
prohibitions
against
fraud
on
the
fda,
and
the
claim
here
conflicts
with
that
allocation
of
authority
because
it
asks
the
states
to
impose
on
an
individual
an
obligation
not
to
defraud
the
fda.
now,
in
this
area
of
preeminent
federal
concern,
there
is
no
room
for
that
state
rule.
it
is
up
to
the
federal
government
to
decide
whether
the
fda
has
been
defrauded
and,
if
so,
what
to
do
about
it,
and
that
is
particularly
true
when
the
question
is
whether
the
fda's
own
internal
decision
making
process
has
been
corrupted
through
an
act
of
fraud.
now,
as
to
the
second
point,
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the
people
who
were...
there
would
not
be
an
injury
for
the
fraud,
but
there
would
be
whatever
other
claims--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--for
the...
there
would
not
be
private
damage
actions
for
the
fraud
on
the
fda.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the
only
remedies
they
would
have
are
the
other
remedies
that
state
laws
affords
if
the
product
was--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
let
me
just
continue.
the
fraud
claim
is
preempted,
but
if
there
is
negligent
design,
negligent
manufacturing,
failure
to
warn,
common
law
malpractice,
all
of
those
claims
are
available,
but
insofar
as
they
would
be
asserting
an
essential
element
of
the
claim
would
be
that
the
fda
was
defrauded,
that
is
an
area
of
exclusive
federal
concern,
and
the
state
common
law
cause
of
action
would
be
preempted.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
331(q)(2)
is
the
prohibition
against
fraud,
21
u.s.c.
331
(q)(2),
which
i
don't
think
is
included
in
any
of
the
materials
here.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
and
the
exclusive
enforcement
is
21
u.s.c.
337(a),
which
with
certain
limited
exceptions
gives
the
federal
government
exclusive
authority
to
enforce
the
act's
prohibitions.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i'm
not
aware
of
cases,
but
we
think
the
same
general
principle,
if
a
court
is
defrauded
and
its
judgment
permits
certain
conduct,
then
the
method
to
go
about
getting
relief
from
that
is
to
go
back
to
the
court
and
say
that
that
judgment
has
been
secured
by
fraud,
and
the
same
thing
is
true
here.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
have
not
seen
that
theory
tried,
justice
kennedy.
now,
the
second
reason
that
there's
preemption
here,
and
this
is
a
second
and
independent
reason,
is
that
the
state
law
common
law
claim
conflicts
with
the
federal
clearance
decision,
and
the
reason--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the
fda's
decision
clearing
the
devices
at
issue
for
marketing,
and
the
reason
that
it
does
is
that
an
essential
element
of
this
claim
is
that
the
devices
never
should
have
come
to
market
under
federal
law,
whereas
the
fda
has
determined
that
they
should,
and
the
fact
that
there
is
an
allegation
here
that
that
decision
was
secured
through
fraud
does
not
avert
the
conflict,
because
the
fda
can
reconsider
its
decisions
and
withdraw
them
if
it
determines
they've
been
secured
by
fraud,
but
unless
and
until
it
does
that,
those
decisions
remain
binding
and
authoritative,
and
they
preempt
any
conflicting
state
law
claims.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes,
justice
stevens,
but
that's
under
my
first
argument
and
not
under
my
second
argument.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
you
probably
do,
justice
scalia,
and
there
may
not
be
a
perfect
analogy
here,
because--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that's
correct,
because
the
second
theory
of
preemption
would
be
gone,
but
our
first
theory
of
preemption,
which
is
that
this
is
a
matter
of
exclusive
federal
control
over
the
decision
as
to
whether
there's
fraud
and
what
the
remedies
for
that
should
be,
would
still
be
in
effect.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
can.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
correct.
now,
finally,
the
final
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no.
we--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--there
would
still
be
a--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--on
the
second
implied
preemption
that
i've
given,
which
is
that
an
outstanding
federal
clearance
decision,
there
would
not
be
preemption,
but...
because
that
would
have
been
withdrawn,
but
on
the
first
theory
preemption
i'm
giving,
which
is
that
the
decision
about
whether
there
is
fraud
and
what
the
remedies
for
that
should
be,
there
would
still
be
preemption
of
that
claim.
now,
either
one
of
those
theories
is
independently
sufficient
to
resolve
this
case.
now,
the
final
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
the
respondents
say
that
this
case
is
just
like
medtronic,
and
the
claims
here
shouldn't
be
preempted
for
the
same
reasons
the
claims
in
medtronic
were
not
preempted,
but
there
are
three
basic
differences
between
the
claims
in
medtronic
and
the
claim
here.
the
claims
there,
the
state
was
performing
its
traditional
role
in
enforcing
ordinary
duties
of
care
running
from
the
manufacturer
to
the
consumer,
whereas
here
it's
seeking
to
impose
an
obligation
on
somebody
not
to
defraud
a
federal
government
agency.
the
claims
there
had
an
existence
that
was
completely
independent
of
the
federal
scheme.
this
claim
is
entirely
derivative.
without
this
federal
regulatory
scheme
you
could
not
have
a
fraud
on
the
fda
claim.
and
finally,
the
claims
there
were
not
preempted
by
the
federal
clearance
decision.
they
all
assumed
that
the
devices
had
been
permissibly
cleared
under
federal
law,
whereas
here,
the
claim
conflicts
with
the
federal
clearance
decision.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
