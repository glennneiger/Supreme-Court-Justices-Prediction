mr.
adam
stein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
turn
first
to
a
couple
of
instances
of
erroneous
fact
findings,
clearly
erroneous
fact
findings.
the
court
below
made
the
following
finding.
of
particular
note
is
dr.
weber's
contention
that
a
much
more
compact
solidly
democratic
twelfth
district
could
have
been
created
had
race
not
predominated.
as
mr.
dellinger
has
just
pointed
out,
no
such
evidence
is
in
the
record
that
plaintiffs
have
pointed
to.
another
one
is
the
statement
by
the--
mr.
adam
stein
--yes,
district
court's
opinion,
i'm
sorry.
and
that
was
at
26a.
the
court
also
found
that--
mr.
adam
stein
--that
was
his
testimony
that
the
court
was
crediting
in
its
fact
findings.
mr.
adam
stein
well,
he
may
have
been
an
expert
witness,
your
honor,
but
there
was
no
showing
in
the
record
anywhere
that
such
a
district
that
he
described
existed.
mr.
adam
stein
he
did
make
that
assertion,
your
honor.
mr.
adam
stein
well,
he...
justice
o'connor,
he
was
asked
about
that,
and
he
did
not
produce,
he
didn't
describe
a
district
that
would
be...
that
would
meet
that
statement.
mr.
adam
stein
that's
my
memory,
justice
souter.
mr.
adam
stein
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
and
the
state
and
the
first...
and
those
are
examples
that
the
plaintiffs
have
put
forward
in
their
briefs
but
were
not
before
the
trial
court,
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
they
were
before
the
general
assembly.
mr.
adam
stein
i
would
respond,
your
honor,
that
the
examples
that
are
pointed
out
in
the
plaintiff's
brief
simply
prove
the
fact
that
no
such
district
can
exist.
they
pointed
out
the
swap
of
some
precincts,
republican
precincts
in
high
point
that
they
say
should
have
been
made
or
could
have
been
made
with
two
democratic
precincts
that
weren't
in
the
district
and
greensboro
some
15
miles
apart.
if
you
look
at
the
map
that
was
attached
to
the
state's
reply
brief,
you
see
that
that
would
be
an
unreasonable
swap,
and
it
was
a
swap
that
nobody
had
ever
proposed
before
the
state
filed
its
reply
brief...
its
brief.
i
would
point
out
that
there
are
other
fact
findings
of
the
district
court
that
are
clearly
erroneous.
the
court
said
at
page
29a,
more
heavily
democratic
precincts
were
bypassed
in
favor
of
precincts
with
a
higher
african-american
population,
and
this
has
been
explored,
and
as
mr.
dellinger
has
pointed
out,
that's
just
simply
not
true.
it
would
be
good
evidence
if
it
were
true,
but
it's
not
true.
the
court
also--
mr.
adam
stein
--no,
your
honor.
even
if
you--
mr.
adam
stein
--that
is
a
question,
in
that
registration
is
not
as
reliable
as
the
voting
record.
but
if
you
look
only
at
voting
registration
statistics,
that
statement
still
isn't
true.
and
the
maps
and
the
records
show
that's
not
true.
the
district
court
also
found,
and
i
quote,
dr.
weber
showed
that,
not
just
in
his
opinion,
showed
that
without
fail
democratic
districts
adjacent
to
district
12
yielded
their
minority
areas
to
that
district,
retaining
quite
democratic
precincts.
and
of
course
this
would
be
an
important
finding
if
it
were
true.
it
would
be
very
much
like
vera
where
there
was
exchanging
of
hispanic
and
african-american
communities
by
census
block
back
and
forth,
but
that
didn't
happen
here.
there's
no
evidence
of
that.
in
fact,
there's
only
one
democratic
precinct
of
the
five
that
surround
district
12.
that's
district
8,
which
is
separated
from
district
12
by
the
county
line
between
cabarrus
and
mecklenburg
county.
the
maps
show
there
are
no
african-american
areas
even
near
that
county
line.
so
that
is
an
important
finding,
we
submit,
that
the
court
made
which
is
simply
not
supported
by
the
record
and
is
clearly
erroneous.
i
would
point
out
that
in
choosing
between
dr.
weber
and
dr.
peterson,
it
said
that
dr.
peterson's
evidence
was
unreliable
because
it
ignored
the
core,
but
this
court
said
in
vera
that
the
difference
between
areas
just
inside
and
just
outside
the
district
is
particularly
probative
in
this
sort
of
case,
and
that's
exactly
what
dr.
peterson
did,
but
that's
what
dr.
weber
criticized
him
for.
i
would
like
to
address
an
argument
advanced
by
appellees
that
was
relied
on
by
the
court
below,
but
they
offer
it
here
in
support
of
the
judgment
below.
they
say
that
the
district,
12th
district
in
1997
plan
is
an
inadequate
remedy
because
it
overlaps
too
much
with
the
population
and
geography
of
the
former
1992
district
in
that
it
gives
congressman
mel
watt
a
good
chance
for
reelection.
we
urge
the
court
to
reject
this
submission
because
it's
inconsistent
with
our
understanding
of
basic
shaw
doctrine.
we
understand
the
shaw
doctrine
that
the
ultimate
question
for
this
case
would
be,
did
the
general
assembly
in
1997
act
with
a
dominant
and
controlling
racial
motivation
overriding
all
political
and
other
legitimate
considerations?
mr.
adam
stein
well,
in
this
case,
the
district
was
different
from
the
district
that
he
had
originally
been
elected
in,
and
in
any
event
it's
never
been
the
law
in
any
of
the
redistricting
cases
that
an
incumbent
for
instance
in
a
one-person,
one-vote
case
can't
be
protected
by
the
use
of
the
core
in
those
districts.
if
this
doctrine
were
to
apply,
it
would
only
apply
to
those
minorities
who
were
elected
in
districts
that
were
ultimately
found
to
be
unconstitutional.
this
incumbent
now
has
been
elected
five
times
in
three
different
versions
of
the
district.
it's
not
only
his
rights
but
the
voters'
rights
to
continue
to
be
able
to
have
an
opportunity
to
vote
for
him.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the...
in
looking
at
the
basic
shaw
doctrine
of
the
decision...
it
turns
on
motivation,
that
the
decision-maker
in
1997,
the
general
assembly
is
a
different
decision-maker
from
the
body
that
created
the
unconstitutional
district
in
1992.
by
1997
there
had
been
a
good
deal
of
turnover.
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
a
century,
republicans
controlled
the
house,
it
was
divided,
they
were
not
under
federal
pressure
to--
