justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
the
fourth
time
that
this
court
has
considered
an
equal
protection
challenge
to
north
carolina's
heavily
minority,
twelfth
congressional
district.
the
legislature
initially
drew
that
district’s
boundaries
in
1992,
creating
a
long
narrow
ugly
shaped
district
with
a
majority
of
african-american
voters.
a
group
of
voters
brought
a
case
in
federal
court
challenging
the
district’s
constitutionality
on
the
ground
that
the
legislature
had
drawn
its
boundaries
primarily
on
the
basis
of
race.
in
1993,
this
court
held
that
the
voters
could
proceed
with
their
constitutional
challenge.
in
1996,
the
court
held
for
the
voters
on
the
merits,
the
evidence
showed
that
the
district’s
boundaries
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
because
when
the
legislature
drew
those
boundaries,
considerations
of
race,
for
example,
a
desire
to
create
an
african-american
majority,
were
predominant.
in
1999,
we
considered
a
new,
but
similar
challenge
to
a
new
district
12’s
boundaries
which
the
legislature
had
modified
in
1997
in
light
of
our
earlier
opinions.
the
district
court
had
decided
through
summary
judgment
procedures
before
trial
that
the
boundaries
still
violated
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
legislature
had
not
changed
them
enough.
we
objected
to
the
manner
in
which
the
district
court
reached
this
conclusion.
there
were
important
factual
disagreements.
summary
judgment
was
not
appropriate
and
we
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
we
now,
consider
the
results
of
those
further
proceedings.
the
district
court
held
a
full
trial.
it
considered
all
the
evidence
and
yet
again
decided
in
favor
of
those
who
were
challenging
the
district.
it
concluded
that
the
legislature
when
redrawing
the
boundaries
of
what
is
not
quite
a
majority-minority
district
had
continued
improperly
to
take
race
into
account.
now,
after
reviewing
the
trial
court
record
we
today
find
the
trial
court’s
decision
clearly
erroneous.
the
legislature’s
redrawn
district
12
boundaries,
in
our
view,
do
not
violate
the
constitution.
in
reaching
this
conclusion
we
apply
standards
drawn
from
this
court’s
earlier
cases
on
race
based
majority-minority
legislative
districting.
to
win,
those
who
challenge
such
a
district,
must
show
that
the
“legislature
subordinated
traditional
race
neutral
districting
principles
to
racial
considerations”.
race
must
not
simply
have
been
“a
motivation
for
the
drawing
of
a
majority-minority
district,
but
the
predominating
factor,
motivating
the
legislature’s
districting
decisions”,
and
those
who
challenge
have
to
show
that
a
facially
neutral
law
was
“unexplainable
on
grounds
other
than
race”.
our
cases
make
clear
that
the
legislature
“must
have
discretion
to
exercise
the
political
judgment
necessary
to
balance
competing
interest”,
and
courts
must
“exercise
extraordinary
caution
in
adjudicating
claims
that
a
state
has
drawn
district
lines
on
the
basis
of
race.”
applying
these
standards
we
consider
the
basic
controverted
district
12
question.
does
race
rather
than
politics
predominantly
explain
that
district’s
1997
boundaries?
the
district
court
thought
that
the
answer
to
this
question
was
‘yes’.
in
large
part
because
it
found
what
it
believed
was
not
it
normally.
it
believed
that
the
legislature
had
left
some
more
heavily
democratic
nearby
precincts
outside
the
district
while
at
the
same
time
it
had
included
other
less
heavily
democratic
precincts
inside
the
district.
why,
the
court
asked.
if
the
legislature
was
simply
trying
to
create
a
safe
seat
for
democrats,
would
they
have
included
less
safe
democratic
precincts,
while
excluding
more
safe
democratic
precincts?
the
answer
must
be
that
it
was
doing
more
than
simply
try
to
include
democrats
and
that
more
sought
the
district
court
involved
a
predominant
motive
to
include
african-americans,
however
they
might
tend
to
vote.
the
record
however
shows
that
if
one
measures
the
democratic
or
republican
nature
of
a
precinct
by
actual
voting
behavior,
rather
than
simply
by
party
registration,
then
the
legislature
in
fact
did
just
what
the
district
court
thought
it
did
not
do.
with
very
few
exceptions,
it
included
the
more
heavily
democratic
precincts
and
it
excluded
the
less
heavily
democratic
precincts.
thus,
there
is
no
anomaly
to
explain.
in
our
opinion,
we
discuss
this
matter
further
and
we
consider
the
other
evidence
before
the
district
court.
as
i
have
said,
we
conclude
that
the
plaintiffs,
who
challenged
the
district’s
boundaries,
simply
did
not
satisfy
their
burden
of
proof,
and
applying
a
clearly
erroneous
standard
of
review,
we
reverse
the
district
court’s
conclusion
to
the
contrary.
