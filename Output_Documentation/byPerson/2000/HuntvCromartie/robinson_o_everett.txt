mr.
robinson
o.
everett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
outset,
let
me
suggest
this,
in
the
last
arguments,
i
heard
some
description
of
what
was
said
by
the
court,
and
i
would
request
that
the
court
at
a
later
time
look
at
the
argument
of
opposing
counsel
and
match
it
up
with
the
opinion
of
the
court
below,
and
i
would
suggest
there
was
very
little
resemblance
between
the
two.
so
that...
that
needs
to
be
taken
into
account.
secondly,
i
think
it's
very
important
that
near
the
end
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
the
previous
appeal
of
this
case,
it
was
pointed
out
that
this
case
was
to
be
remanded
to
a
court
which
was
familiar
with
the
circumstances
and
would
be
in
a
better
position
to
assess
the
motives
of
the
general
assembly
than
would
be
true
of
a
court
of
appeals.
now,
this
court
set...
the
district
court
sat
there
for
two-and-a-half
days
and
heard
testimony,
they
heard
testimony
from
experts,
they
heard
other
testimony.
pursuant
to
the
authority
that
they
have
under
rule
52a,
they
assessed
credibility,
and
unfortunately
for
the
appellants,
they
didn't
believe
the
appellants'
witness,
and
fortunately
for
us,
they
believed
our
witnesses.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
oh,
absolutely,
your
honor.
i
think
they
may
have
been
very
identical,
and
given
the
circumstance
they
were
dealing
with
undisputed
facts,
concerning
such
things
as
percentage
of
racial
breakdown,
that
need
very
little
reason
to
vary
them.
the
facts
were
the
same,
they
were
undisputed.
and
the
opinion
in
many
regards
is
the
same.
the
court
below
each
time
recognized
that
this
court
does
not
wish
it
to
be
interfering
unduly
with
legislative
matters.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
i
don't
think
it's
permissible
justification
for
a
racial
gerrymander.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
your
honor,
i
think
it
has
been
held
it
is
permissible,
not
unconstitutional.
on
the
other
hand,
my
recollection
of
vera
v.
bush
is
that
one
of
the
persons
involved
there
was
a
lady
who
was
in
congress
who
was
utilizing
race
as
incumbency
protection,
and
there
was
held
unconstitutional,
so
i
think
to
whatever
extent
incumbency
protection
is
involved
in
this
context,
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
many
of
the
reasons
that
justice
scalia
has
stated,
the
derivation,
but
also
because
in
deciding
to
protect
the
incumbent,
that
was
really
subsidiary
to
the
primary
purpose
of
creating
a
racially
predominant--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--if
john
smith,
a
person
who
had--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--your
honor,
i
think
if
it
was
simply
a
matter
of
incumbency
and
nothing
more,
we
would
not
be
here.
if
there
were
no
racial
aspect--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--certainly,
certainly.
so
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
question
in
that
regard,
but
the
real
problem
is
that
in
this
instance,
as
the
facts
demonstrate
and
the
statistics
are
part
of
the
facts,
what
was
done
by
the
legislature
was
to
take
away
more
of
the
geographic
area
of
the
12th
district
than
any
of
the
other
prior
districts,
but
to
retain
the
racial
core.
now,
you
find
that
of
the
people
who
are
in
the
12th
district
in
the
1997
plan
as
compared
to
the
'92
plan,
90
percent
of
the
african-americans
were
there
before.
on
the
other
hand,
with
respect
to
the
white
portion
of
the
population,
less
than
50
percent.
it's
pretty
clear
what
was
happening.
if
you
look
at...
there
are
two
maps
here.
if
you
look
at
them
you'll
find
that
although
they
are
parallel,
there
has
been
some
change
of
territory
with
respect
to
precincts
that
are
predominantly
white.
there
was
none
with
respect
to
the
core,
the
racial
core.
we
find
the
legislature
was
using
phrases,
the
leaders
of
the
legislature
were
using
phrases
like
racial
balance
and
core,
which
in
this
context
was
a
clever
way
of
trying
to
say
we
have
reserved
a
district
where
it
is
almost
certain
that
an
african-american--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--i
might
note
two
circumstances
in
that
regard.
first,
the
court
did
find
that
both
in
the
1992
and
the
1997
1st
district,
race
had
predominated.
secondly,
they
gave
statistics
as
to
the
12th
district
which
recognizes
that
it
is
one
of
the
i
think
five
least
compact
districts
in
america,
while
on
the
other
hand,
in
terms
of
geographical
compactness,
the
1st
district
had
been
remedied.
then
frankly,
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
it
was
not
a
matter
of
the
motive,
it
was
a
matter
of
strict
scrutiny
that
save
the
1st
district,
they
found
there
had
been
a
compelling
interest
primarily
i
believe
to
get
preclearance.
so
under
those
circumstances--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--well,
we
frankly
think
the
1st
district
might
be
unconstitutional
but
we
did
not
raise
that
issue
on
appeal.
we
chose
not
to
appeal
it.
but
by
the
same
token,
there
is
much
more
logic
as
to
the
1st
district
in
terms
of
the
area
involved.
a
lot
of
counties
there
are
over
40
percent
african-american
in
population
in
the
northeastern
part
of
the
state.
that
is
all
rural,
virtually
all
rural,
although
there
are
some
smaller
towns
there.
here,
on
the
other
hand,
you're
dealing
with
a
district
where
less
than
30
percent
of
the
population
in
any
of
the
six
counties
is
african-american.
we're
unlike
any
other
district
in
america.
they
split
six
counties,
and
every
county
was
split.
there
is
no
other
district
in
america
where
that
was
done.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
your
honor,
as
i
remember,
that
footnote
we
said
something
to
the
effect
that
since
the
state
didn't
bother
with
compactness
anyway,
we
didn't
feel
that
constrained
in
suggesting--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--your
honor,
let
me
come
up
with
several.
let
me
point
out
that
in
the--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--there
were
in
the
plans
and
the
maps
that
were
shown.
the
history
of
the
drawing
of
the
maps
was
before
dr.
weber
and
also
the
maps
were
before
the
court.
there
were
alternatives
which
were
more
compact
and
still
would
have
preserved
the
democratic
aspect
of
it,
and
it
would
have
been
less
racially
gerrymandered.
the
best
example
of
all,
your
honor,
is
the
plan
that
was
adopted
in
1998
as
a
remedial
plan,
which
was
only
35
percent
african-american,
which
had
one
whole
county
and
involved
only
five
counties.
now,
that
one
was
much
better
than
this
one.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
was
it
what?
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
your
honor,
that
would
be
an
interesting
question.
we
did
not
think
it
was
at
the
time,
but
let
me
put
it
this
way,
we're
gradually
moving
toward
improvement
and
the
thing
that
bothers
us
about
this
is
you've
got
it
down
from
55
to
47,
invalidated
the
47
down
to
35,
and
now
back
up
to
47
percent
african-american
concentrated.
what's
the
message
there?
well,
the
message
is
a
pretty
sad
one,
but
anyway,
even
before
the
greensboro
black
community
was
moved
into
the
12th
district,
and
they
didn't
say
democratic,
they
didn't
mention
democratic
anywhere
in
that
e-mail,
even
before
that
there
were
alternatives
such
as
not
having
greensboro
in
there
at
all,
not
having
high
point,
not
having
guilford
county,
the
sort
of
plan
that
ultimately
emerged
in
1998.
they
had
a
really
good
fall-back
position,
so
that
there
were
alternatives.
but
the
alternatives
did
not
yield
the
result
that
was
being
sought
by
the
leaders
of
the
house
and...
by
the
leaders
of
the
legislature.
one
point
deserves
emphasis.
there
were
different
people
in
the
legislature,
but
there
was
a
continuity
of
some
of
the
people
who
devised
the
1992
plan.
for
example,
mr.
jerry
cohen
was
the
draftsman
of
the
'91
plan,
the
'92
plan,
the
'97
plan,
and
the
'98
plan,
who
defended
all
of
them
as
being...
or
at
least
the
last
three
as
not
being
racial.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
your
honor,
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
the--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--your
honor,
we
start
with
that,
but
after
hearing
testimony...
well,
two
things
in
that
regard.
after
hearing
testimony--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--your
honor,
two
things
in
that
regard.
first,
is
there
a
presumption
when
you
start
from
an
unconstitutional
base
and
say
that
that
is
your
starting
point?
secondly,
after
hearing
testimony
not
only
from
the
legislators
who
were
called
on
the
other
side,
but
the
legislators
who
we
called,
and
the
other
people
who
we
called,
and
after
studying
the
legislative
record
which
inevitably
points
to
particular
conclusions
in
this
case
when
it's
considered
in
context,
and
when
considering
points
like
that
made
in
arlington
heights
where
one
of
the
important
ingredients
is
to
look
at
the
history
of
what
has
happened.
when
you
take
all
that
together,
you
can
say
all
the
presumption
in
the
world
about
good
faith,
but
in
this
instance,
regardless
of
what
presumption
you
want
to
give,
the
facts
as
found
by
that
court
after
hearing
witnesses
and
determining
the
credibility
is
that
the
predominant
motive
was
racial.
now,
back
in
19...
on
the
'92
plan,
they
were
saying
it
wasn't
racial.
to
say
something
is
political
or
incumbent
protection
is
very
convenient.
it's
a
nice
dodge
that
has
been
developed,
and
it's
a
dodge
that
has
been
developed
because--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--your
honor,
it
is
political
in
many
instances,
but
on
the
other
hand
if
you
have
a
strong
racial
minority
well-positioned
in
a
particular
political
party,
they
can
say,
as
we
think
the
evidence
indicates
was
said
in
this
case,
and
remember
that
the
1st
and
the
12th
districts
were
really
the
first
two
that
they
started
with.
then
they
began
worrying
about
some
other
things.
they
can
say,
we
want
a
district
where
we
can
be
assured
that
a
minority
candidate
will
be
nominated
and
will
be
elected.
now,
in
north
carolina,
given
the
legal
constraints
and
given
the
primary
situation,
you
need
to
have
really
about
40,
45
percent
to
be
perfectly
sure.
on
the
other
hand,
with
35
percent,
congressman
watt
has
been
readily
reelected
by
huge
majorities,
but
in
any
event
if
you
put
it
in
context,
there
was
a
primary
purpose
with
respect
to
the
1st
and
the
12th
to
create
for
a
racial
motive
and
to
draw
lines
on
racial
grounds
and
give
the
message
that
was
condemned
in
shaw
v.
reno.
this
is
a
message
where
if
you
look
at
statistics
and
you
are
resident
of
those
areas
and
know
anything
about
them,
you
come
to
the
conclusions
that
we
had
six
witnesses
come
to,
to
the
effect
it
was
predominantly
racially
motivated,
so
that
putting
it
all
in
context--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--all
right.
here
is
the
old
'92
map,
and
let
me
just
show
you
here's
guilford
county.
guilford
county
has
the
greensboro
black
community.
the
greensboro
black
community
would
be
up
at
this...
i'm
sorry
if
you
can't
all
see
it,
and
by
the
way,
there
is
a
map...
these
maps
are
in
the...
right
at
the
beginning,
near
the
beginning
of
volume
2
of
the
joint
appendix.
you
have
guilford,
which
was
added
on
out
of
the
whole
county,
greensboro
was
the
second
stage,
the
greensboro
black
community.
before
this
they
had
the
high
point
black
community.
now,
meanwhile,
there
were
alternative
proposals
similar
to
those--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--it's
the
yellow,
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
there
is
yellow
running
here
from
mecklenburg
down
near
the
south
carolina
line.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
mecklenburg
is
where
charlotte
is,
and
this
is
viewed
as
the
hub
for
these
particular
purposes.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
your
honor,
when
you
read
the
affidavit...
i
would
suggest
apropos
of
weber's
criticism
of
peterson's
analysis
and
the
segment
analysis,
if
you
read,
i
think
it's
302
to
307
or
8
in
the
joint
appendix,
you
will
find,
i
think,
a
devastating
criticism
by
weber
of
peterson.
he
shows
why
this
boundary
segment
analysis
is
totally
unreliable
because
it
places
emphasis
on
almost
infinitesimal
differentiations
between
adjacent
precincts,
ignoring
the
number
of
people
that
are
involved
of
african-american
or
white
race.
secondly,
he
points
out,
that
it
ignores
the
entire
core.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
i'm
sorry
your
honor?
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
we
think
in
the
analysis,
that
you
look
at
the
core,
and
then
you
determine
if
they
were
trying
to
get
the
racial
core,
why
it
is
that
they
drew
it
in
a
particular
manner,
and
that
is
what
dr.
weber
stressed.
i
think
if
you
look
at
his
report,
look
at
his
responses
under
cross-examination,
look
at
his
background
as
someone
who
has
done
a
large
number
of
redistricting
cases,
and
then
look
at
the
curriculum
vitae
of
dr.
peterson,
who
has
done
no
redistricting
cases,
look
at
the
circumstances
in
his
boundary
analysis
has
received
no
peer
review,
has
not
been
utilized
in
any
other
case,
you
will
understand
readily
why
the
court,
even
apart
from
credibility,
which
was
a
better
witness,
decided
to
believe
the
analysis
by
dr.
weber
and
to
reject
the
analysis
by
dr.
peterson.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
well,
the
basis...
they
make
the
point
that
there's
no
basis
for
it.
if
you
read
the
report,
read
the
examination,
you
understand
quite
readily
that
there's
adequate
basis
for
saying
that
the
primary
consideration
in
drawing
these
districts
was
to
group
these
african-american
precincts,
that
was
the
primary
purpose,
and
the
circumstances--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--well,
we
disagree.
we
would
submit
that--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--we
would
submit
that
from
exhibits
we've
submitted
including
maps
that
showed
precincts
that
could
have
been
readily
added
in,
that
their
statement--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--your
honor,
i
think
there
are
other...
i
think
there
are
maps
there
in
addition.
if
you
look
at
the
maps
beginning
in
volume
2,
you'll
see
several
maps
that
we
think
tend
to
support
the
position--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--in
the
footnote
there
is
a
reference
to
other--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--your
honor,
my
recollection
is
that
the
expert,
dr.
weber,
testified
that
he
had
looked
at
a
number
of
maps
and
there
were
alternatives.
i
do
not
recall...
apparently
opposing
counsel
does...
his
being
asked
to
identify
particular
maps
that
would
be
usable.
we
know
from
the
history
that
there
were
maps
that
were
in
existence
that
were
used
in
evolving
the
plan
that
ultimately
was
used.
plans
that
were
in
existence
before
the
greensboro
black
community
was
created
that
could
have
achieved
purposes
of
a
democratic
district--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
can't
hear.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
your
honor,
you
really
have
raised
a
point
that
i
think
is
significant
from
our
standpoint.
in
terms
of
community
of
interest,
what
was
done
was
take
cities
like
greensboro,
high
point,
winston-salem,
and
charlotte,
among
the
largest
cities
in
north
carolina,
charlotte
is
the
largest,
and
divided
the
population
between
white
and
black.
now,
the
white
citizens
on
one
side
of
that
line
have
the
same
interests,
they
listen
to
the
same
tv
shows,
they
read
the
same
newspapers.
they
have
a
much
more
commonality
than
the
african-american
in
charlotte
has
with
the
african-american
in,
let's
say,
greensboro.
if
you
look
at
it
in
terms
of
community
of
interest,
then
this
splitting,
the
splitting
of
cities
is
irreconcilable
with
that
concept
of
community
of
interest.
moreover--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--well,
your
honor,
given
the
circumstance
of
different
standard
metropolitan
areas,
you've
got
large
concentration
up
at
the
north
of
african-americans,
a
large
concentration
down
toward
the
south
in
charlotte.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
i'm
not
aware
of
anything
which
in
this
context
could
define
similarity,
community
of
interest
among
urban
dwellers.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
well,
here
what
they've
done
is
link
portions
of
urban
areas
with
rural
connectives,
and
the
rural
connectives
are
basically
white
fillers.
and
i
don't
know
of
any
other
situation
at
the
present
time
that
corresponds
to
that
in
other
districts.
i
think
this
is
still
a
unique
district,
unique
in
so
many
ways
and
unique
in
sending
a
very
clear
message
that
race
is
predominating.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
referring
to
when
i
was
here
in
hunt
v.
cromartie,
not--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
okay,
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--i
think
that
was
certainly
one
of
the
points
raised.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
your
honor--
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
--your
honor,
i
think
you
said...
you're
there
to
look
at
other
considerations.
i
don't
think
you
said
registration
was
totally
out.
mr.
robinson
o.
everett
well,
it
depends
what
you
mean
by
handful,
particularly
in
the
context
of
large
cities
where
they're
glued
together.
in
charlotte,
in
winston-salem,
and
in
greensboro.
i
believe
there
was
testimony
by
dr.
weber
that
he
had
looked
at
all
three
aspects...
he
looked
at
the
three
elections
which
had
been
considered
by
the
general
assembly
and
were
before
them,
and
came
to
the
same
conclusion.
this
was
all
grouped
under
party
affiliation.
so
he
certainly
came
to
that
conclusion.
the
court
may
have
pointed
out
simply
a
few
that
were
left
out,
and
maybe
there
were
only
a
few.
but
there
was
a
lot
of
evidence
that
was
generated
by
dr.
weber
that
concerned
the
primacy
of
race
as
a
motive
over
politics.
so
i
think,
if
you
look
at
it
in
context,
your
honor,
and
look
at
the
other
things,
look
at
some
of
the
statements
in
the
record,
look
at
what
we
termed
the
smoking
gun,
the
e-mail,
look
at
the
testimony
of
the
legislators
whom
we
called
and
other
persons
whom
we
called,
when
you
take
all
that
together,
it
seems
to
us
just
unmistakably
clear
that
this
court
which
was
familiar
with
the
circumstances
and
which
was
familiar
with
the
motives
of
the
workings
of
the
general
assembly
came
to
a
permissible
conclusion.
one
other
thing
that
deserves
note.
given
the
use
of
pretext,
and
the
court
found
that
one
of
the
persons
on
one
aspect
of
testimony
was
simply
not
credible,
you
have
a
very
significant
circumstantial
evidence,
maybe
it's
more
than
that,
the
use
of
pretext,
as
i
recall
from
the
reeves
case
that
was
decided
this
summer
can
itself
be
positive
evidence
of
a
particular
state
of
mind,
and
we
would
submit
that
the
pattern
followed
by
the
state
in
terms
of
concealment,
excuses,
and
it's
a
pattern
that
continues
from
the
past
in
respect
to
the
1992
plan,
that
this
in
itself
is
evidence.
you
take
the
whole
thing,
you
look
at
what
they
were
doing
with
the
1st
district
where
they
were
concentrating
on
percentages,
you
look
at
the
district
here,
district
12,
where
it
was
announced
to
the
senate
by
senator
cooper
that
as
long
as
they
were
under
50
percent
they
were
home
free,
and
then
look
at
the
way
they
increased
the
percentages.
