unknown
speaker
mr.
dellinger,
are
you
suggesting
that
there
is
some
different
standard
of
proof
of
facts
in
these
cases
or
that
we
should
not
review
a
factual
determination
of
a
clearly
erroneous
rule?
unknown
speaker
that
could
be
true,
but
to
continue
the
question
that
the
chief
justice
asked,
do
we
at
bottom
have
to
apply
a
clearly
erroneous
test
here
to
the
determination
of
the
facts?
unknown
speaker
i
frankly
have
some
difficulty
with
your
position
in
the
case
because
it
is
possible
that
as
a
fact
finder
i
would
not
have
found
the
facts
as
the
court
below
did,
and
yet
the
court
below
appears
to
have
believed
one
expert
over
another
and
made
findings
that
may
have
been
within
its
power
to
make,
and
how
are
we
to
upset
that?
unknown
speaker
you
can
say
that
about
any
number,
no
one
single
decision
would
affect
a
stream
of
decisions,
but,
you
know,
you've
got
factual
findings
here,
and
if
they're
supported
by
some
evidence,
even
though,
as
justice
o'connor
said,
perhaps
we
would
not
have
made
those
findings,
they're
not
clearly
erroneous.
unknown
speaker
dr.
weber
was
asked
was
there
any
majority
black
district
or
precinct,
precinct,
that
conceivably
could
be
included
in
this
district
that
was
not
included,
and
he
said,
rather
astonishingly,
no.
unknown
speaker
you're
basically
saying
that
race
can
be
used
as
a
proxy
for
partisan
affiliation.
and
if
you
say
that
then
it
seems
to
me
that
we're
on
collision
course
with
shaw
and
miller,
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
heart
of
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
just
contrary
to
those
cases.
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
that
was
the
whole
basis
that
you've
just
given
in
your
answer
to
justify
what
happened
here.
unknown
speaker
and
are
you're
saying
that
a
legislature
can
always
defend
a
racial
gerrymander
post
hoc
by
saying
that
it
accords
with
partisan
voting
patterns?
unknown
speaker
so
if
it's
easier
to
use
race,
we'll
just
use
race,
just
save
ourselves
all
the
trouble.
unknown
speaker
did
the
court
below
make
any
findings
as
to
the
intent
of
the
legislature?
unknown
speaker
supported
by
the
statement
that
was
referred
to
in
your
opponent's
brief,
if
i
remember
it
correctly,
the
red
brief
pointed
out
the
statement
of
senator
cooper's
on
the
floor
of
the
legislature
to
the
effect
that
the
plan
that
was
being
proposed
was
not
an
incumbency
protection
plan,
which
lends
obvious
weight
to
the
interpretation
that
it
was
a
racial
protection.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dellinger,
there
is
some
evidence
here,
i
mean,
besides
senator
cooper's
statement,
which,
you
know,
you
offer
an
alternate
explanation
for,
but
you
have
to
explain
it,
and
once
it
becomes
debatable,
it's
hard
for
us
to
say
that
the
finding
of
the
court
below
was
clearly
erroneous.
another
thing
that
has
to
be
explained
away
is,
is
the
e-mail,
cohen
to
cooper,
as
part
of
the
legislative
exchange
which
refers
to
greensboro
black,
that
portion
of
greensboro
at
one
of
the
two
ends
of
this
salamander,
and
referring
to
those
districts
from
greensboro
as
simply
greensboro
black.
now,
you
say
that's
just
shorthand
for
those
portions
of
greensboro
that
were
reliably
democratic.
maybe.
but
certainly
the
other
interpretation
is
a
reasonable
one
as
well,
in
which
case
it
becomes
evidence
that
predominantly
they
were
trying
to
put
together
a
district
that
had
predominantly
black
voters
in
it.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
dellinger.
mr.
stein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
are
you
reading
from
the
district
court's
opinion
or
from
the--
unknown
speaker
--this
witness,
weber,
that
was
his
testimony?
unknown
speaker
and
you're
saying
that
the
court
could
not
have
credited
his
testimony
as
a
so-called
expert
witness?
unknown
speaker
you're
showing--
--but
he
did
make
that
assertion,
you're
not
saying
that
the
court--
unknown
speaker
--i
just
am
trying
to
find
out
why
the
court
couldn't
have
relied
on
his
opinion
if
he
was
somehow
knowledgeable
about
legislative
districting.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
he
was
asked
about
it,
was
he
asked
a
question
saying,
point
out
the
configuration
of
precincts
that
would
have
produced
this
less
racially
correlated
and
more
democratically
correlated
district,
and
he
was
unable
to
do
so?
unknown
speaker
there
are
some
examples
in
the
briefs
of
this,
is
it
footnote
25,
districts
that
might
have
been
made,
mr.
stein.
unknown
speaker
but
you're
trying
to
discredit
the
expert
witness
by
showing
that
some
of
his
factual
statements
were
unsupportable,
and
i
don't
think
it's
up
to
the
trial
judge
when
he
has
an
expert
witness
to,
in
effect,
do
all
of
the
scientific
evaluation
himself.
he's
relying
on...
that's
why
you
have
an
expert
witness,
to
some
extent,
upon
the
credibility
of
the
expert
witness.
it
especially
seems
improper
to
me
when
you're
attacking
the
validity
of
the
expert
witness
on
appeal
in
this
fashion
to
try
to
exclude
the
districts
mentioned
in
the
footnote
on
the
grounds
that,
well,
that
was
never
brought
up
at
the
trial.
but
you're
trying
to
say
that
this
expert
was
not
really
an
expert.
that's
really
what
you're
trying
to
say,
and
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
valid
to
bring
in
some
examples
whether
they
were
brought
in
at
the
trial
or
not,
unless
you
think
that
the
district
judge
cannot
rely
upon
the
generalization
of
the
expert
when
he
says
this
could
have
been
done,
you
could
have
had
a
more
compact
district
without
including
just
the
black
precincts.
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
difference
there
in
registration
and
voting
record?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that's
sometimes
a
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
true,
but
i
must
say
when
your
response
to
the...
one
of
your
responses
to
the
allegation
of
racial
districting
is,
no,
this
was
incumbent
protection,
and
when
the
incumbent
you're
trying
to
protect
is
an
incumbent
who
was
elected
from
an
unconstitutionally
constituted
district,
that
is
the
prior
district
which
was
held
to
be
unconstitutional,
i
think
that
the
defense
of
incumbent
protection
just
washes
out
to
say
you're
going
to
protect
this
incumbent
means
you're
going
to
make
sure
that
the
person
who
was
elected
by
racial
gerrymandering
will
continue
to
be
elected.
i
find
that
not
a
valid
defense.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
stein.
mr.
everett,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
everett,
there
were
whole
parts
of
the
opinion
after
the
hearing
that
were
identical
to
the
opinion
on
summary
judgment,
were
there
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
everett,
can
i
ask
kind
of
a
basic
question,
prompted
by
justice
scalia's
question.
do
you
think
that
incumbency
protection
is
a
permissible
justification
for
a
gerrymander?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
someone
who
is
just
totally
incumbency
protection.
do
you
think
that's
a
permissible
political
activity
for
the
legislature
to
get
involved
in?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
but
assuming
there
was
no
racial
aspect
at
all,
you
would
not
challenge
incumbency
protection
itself
as
somehow
politically
suspect?
unknown
speaker
if
people
in
power
want
to
draft
the
lines
to
keep
themselves
in
power,
that's
perfectly
okay
with
you?
unknown
speaker
we
so
held
in
karcher,
the
karcher
case
from
new
jersey,
didn't
we?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
one
other
general
question,
and
then
i
will
be
through.
proving
the
racial
motivation
was
predominant,
then
you've
got
to
have
strict
scrutiny
to
see
if
it
was
justifiable
and
all
the
rest.
now,
why
is
it,
i
just
have
been
a
little
puzzled
about
the
case,
this
was
proved
with
respect
to
both
the
1st
and
the
12th
districts.
with
respect
to
the
1st,
which
was
even
more
racially
dominated,
as
i
understand
it,
than
the
12th,
the
court
said
that's
okay,
but
not
with
respect
to
the
12th.
why
could
there
be
a
difference
between
the
two?
unknown
speaker
the
compelling
interest
that
applied
to
the
1st
district
did
not
apply
to
the
12th
district.
i
just
never
quite
understood
the
difference.
unknown
speaker
mr.
everett,
the
one
thing
that
puzzles
me
about
that
argument
is
in
this
footnote
25
in
your
brief,
when
you
try
to
answer
the
question,
what
swaps
could
be
made,
and
you
give
a
few
examples,
and
in
every
example
the
result
would
be
a
more
bizarre
shape,
not
a
more
compact
shape.
you
concede
that
by
saying
each
substitution
affects
the
compactness
and
appearance.
but
the
legislature
has
already
ignored
both
of
those
rules
to
such
a
degree
that
further
distortion
appears
immaterial.
so
the
only
answers
that
you
could
come
up
with
would
run
right
into
this
bizarre
shape,
you
would
make
it
more
bizarre
shape.
unknown
speaker
but
you
didn't
come
up
with
one
example
of
a
swap
that
would
work
to
make
it
more
compact.
unknown
speaker
they're
not
in
that
footnote.
unknown
speaker
was
it
good
enough?
unknown
speaker
was
it
good
enough?
unknown
speaker
do
we
start
with
a
presumption
that
the
legislature
acted
in
good
faith
and
for
proper
motives
in
drawing
these
plans?
unknown
speaker
do
we
start
with
the
presumption
that
the
legislature
drawing
a
district
plan
acted
in
good
faith
and
with
proper
motives?
unknown
speaker
your
answer
is
yes.
now,
does
it
totally
drop
out
after
there
is
evidence
put
in
or
what
happens
to
that
presumption?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
isn't
usually
a
dodge.
legislatures
constantly
have...
are
faced
with
drawing
legislative
districts,
and
my
own
experience
is
that
the
motive
in
most
cases
is
political
in
drawing
those
boundaries.
unknown
speaker
mr.
everett,
when
you're
over
there,
would
you
point
out
to
us
where
on
the
map
district
12
is.
unknown
speaker
could
you
just
tell
us,
is
it
the
yellow
district?
unknown
speaker
and
mecklenburg
is
the
county
that
charlotte
is
in?
unknown
speaker
your
expert,
mr.
weber,
said
that
the
defendant's
expert,
mr.
peterson,
used
an
unconventional,
untried
theory.
because
as
i
understood
it,
the
criticism
was
that
he
concentrated
only
on
the
fringe
districts
and
not
the
core,
but
i
thought
it
was
the
fringe
districts
that
were
the
problem
here.
could
you
help
me
with
that?
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
that's
what
you
wanted
to
ignore?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that's
what
you
wanted
to
ignore.
or
am
i
missing
something?
unknown
speaker
one
other
point.
the
appellants
say
that
the
court's
just
wrong
or
the
expert's
just
wrong
to
say
there
were
more
heavily
democratic
precincts
with
white
populations,
with
heavier
white
populations
that
were
excluded.
in
oral
argument
this
morning
they
said
there
is
just
no
basis
for
that.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
they
say
that
the
proof
for
that
purpose,
according
to
your
expert,
is
that
there
were
some
we'll
call
them
mixed
districts
that
were
heavily
democratic
that
were
excluded,
and
they
say
that
is
just
not
so.
unknown
speaker
where
do
i
look
to
find
if
that's
so
or
not?
unknown
speaker
are
those
other
than
the
ones
in
the
footnote
25?
unknown
speaker
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
the
maps.
unknown
speaker
i'm
just
awed
that
you
would
think
you
would
pick
your
best
cases
to
give
to
supply
the
missing
link
in
the
experts'
testimony,
and
yet
the
ones
that
you
pick
as
your
presumably
best
cases
all
make
this
district
even
odder
shape
than
it's
ever
been.
unknown
speaker
but
none
of
them
were
brought
to
our
attention,
and
none
of
them
were
in
the
district
court's--
unknown
speaker
--there
is
one
traditional
criterion
that
you
don't
mention,
and
that
at
least
some
people
in
the
senate
gave
credence
to,
and
that
is
linking
together
the
cities
that
had
commonality
of
interest,
a
community
of
interest
in
problems
like
health
care
and
housing
and
deteriorating
public
schools.
they
may
have
been
distant
from
each
other,
but
they're
all
cities
with
those
problems
that
are
common
to
the
urban
poor.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
a
hundred
percent
sure
that's
true.
i
can
think
of
some
areas
of
this
city
that
might
have
more
in
common
with
areas
of,
say,
boston
than
with
each
other.
take
the
difference
between
anacostia
and
northwest
in
washington,
d.c.
in
the
same
city
but
perhaps
it's
a
greater
commonality
of
interest
with
other
cities,
with
similar
populations
in
other
cities.
unknown
speaker
you
know
any
other
state,
mr.
robinson,
that
has
chosen
to
divide
its
electorate
into
urban
dwellers
and
rural
dwellers?
unknown
speaker
and
this
wouldn't
be
an
unusual
district
if
other
states
linked
their
major
cities
with
a
ribbon
in
between
to
make
it
contiguous?
unknown
speaker
one
of
your
arguments
the
first
time
was
that
race
was
predominant
because
they
kept
heavily
democratic
districts
out
but
they
put
less
democratic
african-american
district
precincts
in,
right?
that
was
the
first
time
you
argued,
when
you
were
here
before,
one
of
your
arguments
was--
unknown
speaker
--yeah,
i
mean
this
side,
this
side.
unknown
speaker
and
then
in
response...
am
i
right
so
far
that
one
of
the
main
arguments
was,
look,
this
is
not
democrats,
this
is
race,
and
you
can
show
it
by
looking
at
the
heavily
democratic
districts
that
they
left
out
and
the
heavily
less
democratic,
but
the
heavily
african-americans
that
they
put
in.
that's
the
argument.
and
what
this
court
said
in
response
is,
wait
a
minute,
if
you're
going
to
argue
that,
don't
measure
it
by
registration,
measure
it
by
how
people
vote
because
a
lot
of
registered
democrats
vote
republican.
that's
what
this
court
said
in
its
opinion.
is
that
fair?
unknown
speaker
and
now
when
i
look
at
the
district
judge's
opinion,
one
of
his
points,
one
of
them
was
not
just
the
war
of
experts.
one
of
them
was...
and
he
says
it,
he
says
it,
one
of
them,
like
21
or
where
is
it
here?
he
says
it
specifically.
he
says
that
additionally,
the
evidence
shows
that
the
more
heavily
democratic
precincts
are
bypassed,
i.e.
they're
out,
in
favor
of
the
more
heavily
african-american,
which
are
in.
when
i
look
to
what
he
based
that
on
on
page
13a
and
14,
it
is
two
pages...
registration,
registration,
registration.
just
what
we
said
he
shouldn't
use.
and
then
i
looked
at
your
maps,
which
very
honestly,
are
not
registration,
they
are
how
people
really
vote,
and
the
yellows
are
the
democrats
and
the
yellows
are
in,
in,
in,
and
there
are
just
a
handful
of
the
hundred
precincts
that
are
out.
so
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
about
that
finding?
it
looks
as
that
finding
is
a
finding
that's
based
on
the
very
thing
we
said
not
to
use...
registration.
unknown
speaker
i
think
it's
all
right
when
it
seems
to
work
the
other
way.
i
wanted
to
get
your
response
if
there's
a
chance.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
it's
not
out,
but
they
said
don't
do
registration
alone,
and
so
when
i
looked
at
pages
13a
and
14,
it
looked
to
me
in
that
appendix
that
for
that
point
the
judge
is
using
registration
alone,
and
when
i
looked
at
your
maps,
which
are
not
registration
alone,
it
looked
to
me
as
if
all
the
democratic
precincts
are
in
except
for
a
handful.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
