mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
shaw
versus
reno
line
of
cases
this
court
established
two
important
propositions.
the
first
is
that
the
constitution
does
not
tolerate
using
race
as
the
predominant
factor
in
drawing
legislative
districts.
when
a
district
is
drawn
predominantly
on
racial
lines,
the
state
reinforces
harmful
racial
stereotypes.
it
sends
a
message
to
elected
officials
that
they
represent
only
a
particular
racial
group.
those
cases
stand
also
for
a
second
proposition.
as
this
court
said
in
miller,
federal
court
review
of
districting
legislation
represents
a
serious
intrusion
on
the
most
vital
of
local
functions.
for
this
reason,
the
important
second
principle
is
that
federal
courts
adjudicating
shaw
claims
must
exercise
extraordinary
caution.
the
decision
below
would
severely
compromise
this
second
principle.
that
ruling
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
admonition.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
the
decision
below
was
clearly
erroneous,
and
we're
perfectly
happy
to
meet
the
standard
that
the
conclusions
were
clearly
erroneous.
because
the
court
did
not
separate
out
findings
of
fact
from
conclusions
of
law,
it
is
possible
to
read
the
opinion
as
if
the
court
did
not
actually
apply
the
standard,
but
requiring
a
predominance
of
race
to
be
shown,
in
which
case
it
would
have
applied
the
wrong
legal
standard,
but
taking
them
to
have
found
that
race
predominated
here,
in
our
view
that
is
clearly
erroneous.
i
only
mean
to
suggest,
as
this
court
has
said
in
bush
v.
vera,
and
in
miller
that
because
redistricting
is
such
an
exceedingly
sensitive
matter
that
the
court
should
be
awfully
cautious
before
they
conclude
that
a
state
legislature--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--not
if
you
find
that
when
you
read
the
district
court's
opinion
that
the
court
simply
wasn't
applying
a
standard
that
required
the
court
to
conclude
that
race
predominated
and
subordinated
other
conclusions.
you
can
say,
well,
it
did
refer
to
the
predominance
test,
but
that's
not
what
it
was
applying.
the
evidence
that
it
adduced
at
best
was
evidence
that
was
probative
only
of
whether
race
was
one
of
the
factors
that
was
considered
here.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
justice
o'connor,
it
takes
a
careful
review
because
there
is
simply
nothing
probative
underlying
the
conclusions
of
the
district
court.
we
set
out
at
pages
25
to
33
of
our
brief,
we
really
have
to
go
through
the
trial
transcript
citations,
the
court
says,
for
example,
that
where
splits
occur
in
district
12
in
the
six
counties
between
district
12
and
the
other
districts,
the
splits
invariably
occur
along
racial
rather
than
political
lines,
if
that's
a
fact
it
will
certainly
tend
to
show
predominance.
it's
simply
not
true.
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
appellees
point
to
a
single
instance
of
a
split
in
which
race
trumps
politics.
for
example,
in
the
plurality
opinion
in
bush
v.
vera,
you
find
that
in
that
case
the
texas
redistricters,
faced
with
precincts
that
were
minorities,
hispanic
or
african-american,
but
where
the
precinct
itself
was
majority
republican,
went
out
and
took
that
in,
in
order
to
bring
in
the
minority
group,
even
though
that
was
contrary
to
the
asserted
goal.
that's
set
out
at
page
917
of
bush
v.
vera.
there
is
simply
no
instance
of
that.
the
two
big
items
of
proof...
i
am
quite
confident
that
reversing
the
court
below
and
sustaining
the
north
carolina
plan
will
not
in
any
way
impair
the
vitality
of
this
court's
antiracial
gerrymandering
principle
either
on--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--let
me
go
to
explain
why
those
findings
are
clearly
erroneous.
let
me
give
you
one
example.
the
court
says
that...
or
the
appellees
say,
the
courts
say
that
this
is
completely
consistent
with
race
and
not
with
politics,
the
appellees
walk
away
from
that
and
say
that
the
lines
are
more
precisely
correlated
with
race
than
with
politics.
what
do
they
cite
for
that?
they
cite
for
that
the
proposition
that
of
the
six
counties,
these
six
counties
take
in...
district
12
takes
in
90
percent
of
the
40
percent
or
more
african-american
precincts
in
the
six
counties,
90
percent,
whereas
if
you
look
at
the
democratic
counties,
even
as
measured
by
reliable
voting
day
democrats,
only
about
half
of
the
democratic
counties...
i'm
sorry,
only
about
half
of
the
democratic
precincts
in
the
six
counties
are
taken
in.
that
was
their
proof
that
the
lines
follow
race
more
precisely
than
politics.
but
look
at
those
figures.
they're
set
out
in
exhibit
309
on
page
515.
there
are
429
precincts
in
these
six
counties.
of
those
429
precincts,
79
of
them
are
40
percent
or
more
african-american.
understandably,
those
are
the
most
reliable
democratic
voting
precincts,
and
therefore
they
form
the
core
of
a
difficult
attempt
to
create
a
democratic
congressional
district
in
this
republican
area.
so
76
of
the
79
african-american
precincts
which
are
the
most
reliable
democratic
precincts
are
included
in
this.
now,
there
are
another
300...
another
290...
there
290
precincts,
including
those
that
are
democratic,
about
half
of
those
are
included
within
the
district,
but
there's
no
need
for
any
more.
the
ones
that
aren't
included
would,
a,
blow
this
district
way
past
the
equal
population
point
and,
b,
they
are
less
reliable
democratic
than
the
76
african-american
precincts
included.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
correct,
and
he
also
gave
the
following
answer.
he
talked
about
how
there
were...
and
justice
kennedy,
the
reason
that
makes
sense,
that
all
the
african-american
precincts
that
could
reasonably
have
been
included
are
included
is
that
those
are
the
core
democratic
precincts
in
what
is
basically
a
republican
area
of
north
carolina
in
the
piedmont
carolinas,
so
that
is
naturally
the
core
that
is
the
overlap,
and
that
is
the
correlation.
there
are
other
democratic
precincts,
dr.
weber
noted,
that
are
not
included,
and
he
was
asked
the
following
question
at
page
140
of
the
joint
appendix.
question:
are
the
white
precincts
as
heavily
democratic?
answer:
no.
so
that--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no,
i
am
so
glad
you
asked
that.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
have
to
say
that
i'm
so
glad
you
asked
that
because
that
is
a
misconception
i
most
want
to
correct.
we
are
absolutely
not
saying
that
you
can
use
race
as
a
proxy
for
democratic
voting
behavior.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
no.
with
all
due
respect,
justice
kennedy,
that
is
exactly
not
the
case.
this
is
a
districting
process
in
which
the
state
used
voting
statistics
of
how
people
actually
voted,
not
the
color
of
their
skin,
how
did
they
vote,
in
constructing
this
district,
unlike
the
districts
in
miller
and
bush
v.
vera.
instead
of
using
racially
encoded
census
blocks,
they
used
precinct
voting
day
election
patterns.
this
precinct...
these
precincts
were
used
to
make
up
the
heart
of...
these
democratic
precincts
made
up
the
heart
of
the
democratic-leaning
district.
it
is
the
appellees
and
the
court
below
which
point
out
to
you
that
those
districts
are
african-american.
our
response
is,
but
the
legislature
and
its
leadership
told
you
that
the
reason
they
were
selected
is
that
they
were
creating
a
democratic
precinct,
and
they
use...
it's
absolutely
critical
because
we
do
not
believe
and
do
not
contend
that
you
can
sort
voters
into
congressional
districts
by
using
race
as
the
criteria
on
the
assumption
that
that
is
correlated
with
political
behavior.
what
we
are
saying
is
what
this
court
said
in--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes,
where
the
plaintiffs
are
unable
to
disprove
that--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no,
no,
because
there
is
a
very
great
difference
between
using
race
and
using
politics.
this
is
washington
against
davis.
to
use
something
which
correlates
with
race,
for
example,
in
batt
and
hernandez,
the
texas
case
involving,
requiring
english
speakers
on
the
jury,
it
may
correlate
with
race,
but
you
can't
use
race
itself.
you
can't
use
being
hispanic
as
a
proxy,
but
you
can
use
english.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
its
overall
conclusion
was
that
the
legislature
intended
to
use
race
as
a
district,
and
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
all
right,
justice
souter,
i
believe
that
was
a
matter
of
his
objecting
to
the
labeling
of
the
incumbency
protection.
he
goes
on
to
say
in
the
same
sentence
that
the...
literally
in
the
next
sentence,
that
the
purpose
of
the
plan
is
to
protect
the
state's
existing
6-6
republican-democratic
split.
this
was
a
bipartisan
state
legislature,
a
republican
house,
a
democratic
senate.
neither
side
could
agree
to
reduce.
i
think
senator
cooper
was
only
objecting
to
the
terminology
and
not
to
the
fact
that
to
maintain
a
6-6
balance
you
had
to
have
a
district
here,
but
if
i
may
respond,
again,
to
justice
kennedy's
very
important
point,
i
understand
the
thought
that,
well,
look,
if
it
turns
out
if
a
legislature
does
undertake
to
create
a
democratic
district,
for
example,
in
a
republican
seat
like
this,
in
order
to
keep
that
6-6
balance,
and
it
turns
out
that
those
precincts
that
are
at
the
core
of
it
also
happen
to
be
african-american,
won't
they
simply
have
accomplished
the
objective
that
we,
you
know,
tried
to
stop
in
shaw
v.
reno.
the
answer
is
no.
that
was
the
use
of
race,
and
it
is
also
the
case
that
when
in
most
all
instances,
perhaps
not
every,
that
a
state
undertakes
to
make
race
drive
the
process,
there
will
be
plenty
of
evidence
of
it.
for
example,
you
will
find
areas
where,
as
in
bush
v.
vera,
if
you
have
a,
say,
a
republican
district
that
has
a
significant
number
of
minorities
in
it,
you
put
it
in
a
supposedly
democratic
district,
so
that
shows
it
following
race.
that's
how
you
prove
it.
moreover--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--let
me
suggest
why
i
think
that
is
really
utterly
insufficient
as
being
really
probative,
to
set
aside
a
fundamental
act
of
political
self-definition
by
a
state
legislature.
this
is
a
sentence
in
an
e-mail
from
a
staffer
to
members
that
says
that
in
the
districting
context
where
they
have
to
talk
about
race
because
of
the
voting
rights
act,
he
notes
that
the
change
he
has
been
making
is
that
they're
now
going
to
for
very
good
nonracial
reasons
include
greensboro
in
district
12,
the
democratic
parts
of
greensboro,
and
refers
to
that
by
saying,
i
have
moved
the
greensboro
black
community
into
the
12th.
now,
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
that
that
is
without
any
probative
value,
but
in
order
for
it
to
play
any
significant
role
in
invalidating
a
state
law,
you
have
to
conclude
first
of
all
that
it's
not
merely
descriptive,
it's
not
like
saying
what
are
these
new
precincts
the
legislature
has,
so
this
is
a
working
class
italian
neighborhood
and
the
other
new
precinct
in
your
district
is
a
jewish
retirement
community.
no,
it
is...
you
have
to
read
it
as
being
an
explanation
of
the
motive
for
the
move,
and
you
would
have
to
assume
that
you
attributed
that
to
the
whole
legislature,
not
to
the
staff
or
to
the
two
recipients,
and
you
have
to
assume
that
that
would
be
evidence
of
the
predominance
of
race.
i
simply
don't
think
it
will
bear
that
kind
of
weight.
a
stray
remark
like
this,
to
use
a
stray
remark
like
this
would
be
akin
to
a
stringent
speech
code
where
legislators
who
engage
in
the
sensitive
redistricting
process
find
state
law
brought
into
jeopardy,
and
that's
why
there's
very
good
reason
for
predominance.
the
other
way
to
prove
a
shaw
violation,
if
i
may
turn
just
for
a
moment
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
the
other
way
to
prove
a
shaw
violation
is
quite
simple.
when
the
state
says
we're
using
politics,
not
race,
it
turns
out
that
there
are
a
lot
of
high
proportion
of
african-americans,
that's
because
they're
reliable
democrats.
you
can
often
come
in
and
show,
now,
wait
a
minute,
there
would
be
a
very
easy
way,
more
sensible
district
that
you
could
have
created
here
that
would
have
been
reliably
democratic,
and
this
1
that
runs
through
6
counties
is
completely
unnecessary
to
accomplish
that
goal.
the
different
district
has
to
be
more
central.
there
is
no
showing
here
of
a
different
district
that
would
in
any
way
suggest
that
it
was
pretextual
for
the
state
to
utilize
politics.
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
if
you
look
at
the
map
and
with
some
understanding
of
the
demographics
of
north
carolina,
you
can
see
that
the
bipartisan
legislature
faced
a
difficult
task
in
attempting
to
create
a
sixth
democratic-leaning
congressional
district
in
this
part
of
the
state.
one
of
the
joys
of
north
carolina
is
that
we
don't
have
a
big
metropolitan
area
like
atlanta.
we
have
a
nice
string
of
more
medium-sized
cities,
from
charlotte
running
through.
so
you
simply
take
north
carolina's
atlanta--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--it's
getting
too
big
for
my
taste,
but
it's...
but
the...
they
accomplish
this
in
every
instance
by
creating
districts,
one
for
the
republican
sue
myrick
in
mecklenburg
county
and
one
for
the
democrat
mel
watt,
each
a
rising
star.
their
expert
thought
mecklenburg
should
be
entirely
within
one
district,
but
charlotte
is
very
happy
to
have
rising
stars
in
each
party
represent
charlotte,
and
neither
of
the
political
parties
wanted
to
cede
charlotte
to
the
other.
so
you
really
have
an
expert
who
is
making
political
judgments.
this
case
may
be
your
final
opportunity
to
address
redistricting
before
the
2000...
post-2000
redistricting
occurs,
and
i
think
it's
worth
asking
again
why
is
predominance
the
standard.
the
court
has
consistently
rejected
the
idea
that
any
consideration
of
race,
however
small,
should
trigger
strict
scrutiny.
that's
properly
because
of
the
nature
of
the
shaw
harm.
the
shaw
harm
is
not
hostility
towards
individuals.
it
is
communication
of
a
message
that
people
are
defined
by
their
race,
and
when
race
predominates,
you
have
the
shaw
harm.
to
move
to
a
more
extreme
exclusion
of
race
would
create
a
hair
trigger
in
which
legislatures
would
be
completely
uncertain
of
their
ability
to
legislate.
we'll
have
judges
creating
election
districts
and
rather
than
state
legislatures
doing
this
critically
important
task
that
involves
political
judgment,
we
usually
say
plans
that
do
not
cause
expressive
harms
should
not
be
declared
unlawful.
thank
you.
