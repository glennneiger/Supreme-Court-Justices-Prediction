mr.
jeff
s.
olson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
interaction
of
four
principles,
all
designed
to
eliminate
the
danger
of
censorship
by
delay,
from
this
court's
decisions
on
speech
licensing
schemes.
first,
in
order
to
comply
with
the
first
amendment,
a
speech
licensing
scheme
that
acts
as
a
prior
restraint
must
guarantee
an
applicant
a
prompt
final
administrative
decision
in
a
short,
fixed
period
of
time.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
yes.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
it
is
a
speech
licensing
scheme
because
it
requires
a
license
to
operate
an
adult
book
store.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
you're
correct.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
you're
right
that
the
waukesha
ordinance
doesn't
permit
licensing
decisions
on
its
face
to
be
made
on
the
basis
of
content,
but
the
court
i
believe
has
recognized
in
city
of
lakewood
and
in
fw/pbs
that
licensing
decisions
that
are
not
expressly
content
based
can
still
be
used
for
covert
content
based
censorship.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
yes.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
not
in
this
case.
we
will
do
that
in
some
future
case,
but
we
have
not
made
that
argument
in
this
case
and
we
don't
think
the
court
should
reach
that
argument
in
this
case.
this
is
a
case
about
procedures,
not
about
the
substantive
disqualification
criteria.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
oh,
all
of
those
laws
of
general
application
that
don't
act
as
prior
restraints
targeted
at
speech
can
be
enforced.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
they're
targeted
at
speech
in
the
sense
that
they're
tied
to
the
license,
and
they're
tied
to
the
permission
to
continue
your
ongoing
speech.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
those--
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
--if
the
requirement
to
have
the
electricity
only
applies
to
book
stores,
yes,
it
would
be
subject
to
the
freedman
guarantees.
if
it
applies
to
everybody,
as
all
those
building
code
requirements
do
as
far
as
i
know,
then
they're
not
subject
to
the
freedman
guarantees,
and
that's
what
the
court
said
in
lakewood.
the
second
principle
that
i
think
controls
the
court's
disposition
of
this
case
is
that
a
speech
licensing
scheme
violates
the
first
amendment
if
it
permits
the
status
quo
to
be
altered
to
the
applicant's
detriment
during
the
administrative
proceedings.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
that's--
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
--that's
absolutely
correct.
in
freedman
and
in
southeastern
promotions
the
court
said
that
a
prior
restraint
before
judicial
review
can
be
imposed
only
where
it
maintains
the
status
quo.
where
the
status
quo
is
speech,
obviously
you
can't
impose
a
prior
restraint
prior
to
judicial
review,
and
in
the
tail
end
of
southeastern
promotions
the
court
listed
the
constitutional
deficiencies
with
the
law
at
issue
there,
and
one
of
the
deficiencies
listed
was
that
it
permitted
the
status
quo
to
be
altered
to
the
applicant's
detriment
before
judicial
review.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
it
was
a
new
speech
case,
that's
correct,
but
i
believe
the
court
found
that
the
status
quo
was
altered
to
the
applicant's
detriment
because
the
show
in
the
presentation
of
hair
in
southeastern
promotions
had
to
be
postponed
and
they
lost
their
date
for
the
presentation.
we
believe
that
the
third
principle
governing
this
case
is
that
a
licensing
scheme
that
acts
as
a
prior
restraint
must
confer
upon
an
unsuccessful
applicant
the
right
to
prompt
judicial
review,
and
the
fourth
principle
is
that--
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
--we
believe
that's
what
southeastern
promotions
requires,
and
we
believe
that's
the
only
way
to
prevent
injury
from
lack
of
prompt
judicial
review.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
it's
right
that
that's
the
rule
we're
urging
the
court
to
find
in
southeastern
promotions
and
fw/pbs
and
apply
in
this
case,
but
it's
wrong
to
say
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
promptness
of
judicial
review,
i
think,
because
the
question
on
which
the
court
granted
certiorari
is
does
the
licensing
ordinance
have
to
contain
language
to
prevent
injury
from
want
of
prompt
judicial
review,
and
the
only
way
to
prevent
injury
from
want
of
prompt
judicial
review
when
you're
enacting
city
licensing
ordinance
is
to
maintain
the
status
quo,
guarantee
the
status
quo--
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
--justice
scalia,
it's
not
sufficient
for
five
reasons.
first,
the
timing
of
that
sort
of
temporary
relief
is
in
the
discretion
of
the
circuit
court
and
can
depend
on
lots
of
factors,
including
docket
pressure--
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
--well,
that
really
depends
on
what
this
court
says
in
this
case.
if
the
court
says
in
this
case,
as
we
urge
it
to
say,
that
the
status
quo
through
judicial
review
must
be
guaranteed,
then
i
suppose
we
could
go
into
circuit
court
and
get
on
the
schedule
for
a
motion
and
have
the
judge
receive
briefs
and
decide
our
motion
and,
after
a
period
of
time,
issue
an
order
implementing
this
court's
decision.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
no.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
i
don't
think
that
a
stay
order,
the
possibility
of
a
stay
order
in
the
circuit
court
is
an
adequate
substitute
for
freedman
safeguards,
including
maintenance
of
the
status
quo
as
written
into
the
ordinance.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
the
court
of
appeals
believed
that
the
status
quo
would
be
maintained
through
the
administrative
proceedings
automatically,
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
wasn't
necessary
to
maintain
the
status
quo
through
the
termination
of
judicial
proceedings.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
well,
we
wouldn't
have
much
of
a
claim
on
a
stay
today
except
by
making
the
arguments
from
freedman
and
southeastern
promotions
that
we're
making
here
today.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
we
could.
that
would
be
an
argument
going
to
the
merits
of
the
claim
and,
of
course,
it
would
be
relevant
to
the
issuance
of
a
stay,
because
we
have
to
show
probability
of
success.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
i
don't
even
get
to
whether
we're
entitled
to
an
automatic
stay
in
my
thinking,
because
i
don't
think
that
the
possibility
of
a
stay
being
imposed
in
a
discretionary
manner
in
the
circuit
court
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
southeastern
promotions,
freedman,
fw/pbs.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
or
some
provision
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
in
an
as
applied
challenge
that
would
be
correct,
but
this
is
a
facial
challenge.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
if
that
were
always
true,
then--
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
--the
court
wouldn't
have
to
worry
about
a
specific
guarantee--
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
--getting
that
stay
does
require
us
to
show
a
reasonable
probability
of
success
on
the
merits.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
not...
not
really,
in
terms
of
timing
especially.
we
can't
show
a
reasonable
probability
of
success
on
the
merits
in
an
administrative
review
until
that
administrative
record
gets
to
the
court,
and
there's
no
time
limit
on
that
under
the
unamended
ordinance.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
that's
correct,
and
we
have
no
as
applied
challenge
here.
this
is
strictly
a
facial
challenge
case.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
our
client
is
still
just
barely
in
business
operating
as
a
nonadult
store,
and
intending
to
close
even
that
operation
within
a
matter
of
days,
but
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief--
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
--the
case
isn't
moot
because
there's
a
disability
from
licensure
that
flows
from
having
violated
the
ordinance
by
operating
without
a
license,
which
i
told
them
they
were
entitled
to
do
under
shuttlesworth,
because--
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
--well,
there's
no
showing
that
they
intend
to
engage
in
this
business,
or
that
they
have
not
applied
for
a
new
license
and
they
don't
have
an
application
pending
now,
but
they
haven't
foresworn
any
intention
to
apply
for
a
license
at
some
other
location
in
the
future.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
not...
my
client
has
a
real,
concrete
interest
in
having
a
facially
valid,
constitutional
ordinance
on
the
book
in
waukesha.
city
news
and
novelty
and
its
officers
have
real
interests
in
that--
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
--yes.
the
city
news
and
novelty
is
footing
the
bill
for
this
case
because
they
believe
they're
right,
they
believe
in
it's
important
principle,
and
they
don't
want
the
5-year
disability
from
licensure
that
will
fall
on
the
corporation
and
its
officers.
if
they're
determined
to
have
been
operating
without
a
license
in
violation
of
a
valid
ordinance
up
until
february
14,
2000,
which
is
when
they
stopped
operating
as
an
adult
book
store,
they'd
be
disabled
from
licensure
in
waukesha
for
5
years
after
that,
until
valentine's
day
2005.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
justice
scalia,
they
do
in
the
following
sense.
if
there
is
no
valid
judicial
review
path
in
this
licensing
ordinance,
then
there's
no
valid
renewal
mechanism,
and
the
whole
licensing
requirement
becomes
facially
invalid.
then
they're
entitled
to
operate
without
a
license.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
my
client
was
allowed
to
continue,
but
my
client
was
entitled
to
have
that
guaranteed
on
the
face
of
the
ordinance,
and
we
contend
that
the--
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
--that's
right.
there
are
some
of
the
cases
going
to
the
requirement
of,
for
example,
explicit
and
specific
and
objective
licensing
standards
that
recognize
that
these
could
be...
these
could
come
from
usage
or
authoritative
construction,
as
well
as
on
the
face
of
the
legislation,
but
here
there
is
no
usage
or
authoritative
construction
that
builds
a
status
quo--
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
--well,
as
far
as
i
know,
this
is
the
only
establishment
ever
to
be
licensed
in
waukesha
as
an
adult
book
store.
there's
nothing--
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
--the
court
has
held
in
more
than
one
case
that
license
applicants
are
entitled
more
to
the
hope
of
the
grace...
to
more
than
the
hope
of
the
grace
of
the
government.
they're
entitled
to
a
guarantee.
in
other
words,
maybe
they
will.
maybe
they
will
let
the
next
guy
stay
open,
too,
or
maybe
they'll
say
that
we
let
olson's
clients
stay
open
because
that
was
test
case,
raising
constitutional
issues
about
our
ordinance
and
we
weren't
sure
how
it
was
going
to
come
out,
now
we
know,
so
you've
got
to
close
with
our
nonrenewal
decision.
we're
entitled--
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
--yes,
i
think
it
does.
i
think
if
we
were
making
an
as
applied
challenge
the...
justice
scalia
would
be
right
in
the
sense
that
we
haven't
suffered
any
injury,
because
we
were
allowed
to
remain
open.
the
fact
that
we're
making
a
facial
challenge,
i
think
first
of
all
it
focuses
the
court's
attention
on
the
ordinance
as
it
stood
in
1995,
and
that's...
in
'96,
and
that
it
prevents
it
from
being
mooted
out
by
the
subsequent
amendments
to
the
ordinance
that
have
taken
place
four
times
this
year.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
yes.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
correct.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
correct.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
well--
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
--sure.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
the
third
parties
are
protected
from
a
couple
of
the
original
problems.
they're
protected
from
indefinite
time...
indefinite
times
in
the
administrative
procedure.
but
they're
not
protected
from
lack
of
prompt
judicial
review
and
lack
of
preservation
of
the
status
quo
during
judicial
review.
the
third
parties
out
there
who
will
apply
for
renewal
in
the
future
under
this
ordinance
will
still
face
those
facial
problems
with
the
scheme
as
it
stands
today.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
i--
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
--i
think
your
cases
prevent
you
from
assuming
that
we
are
in
the
same
boat
with
them.
i
think
they
prevent
you
from
assuming
that
they
won't
be
required
to
close
pending
judicial
review,
for
example,
or
that--
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
--because--
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
--we
got
the
grace
of
the
government
and
a
special
dispensation
to
be
allowed
to
remain
open.
future
applicants,
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
will
get
that,
and
they
are
entitled--
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
--maybe
not
totally
out
of
the
market.
they
might
want
to
apply
for
a
license
at
some
other
location.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
setting
that
particular
organization
aside
and
looking
at
future
operations
that
might
be
deciding
whether
or
not
to
locate
in
waukesha,
i
don't
think
it's
beyond
the
stretch
of
the
imagination
to
suggest
that
they
might
decide
to
go
elsewhere
if
this
court
decides
that
waukesha's
ordinance
is
just
fine
and
you
can
be
nonrenewed
administratively
for
popcorn
on
the
floor,
and
you
have
to
close
until
you
get
a
judicial
decision
on
the
merits
that
that's
an
unconstitutional
criterion.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
we
do
contend
that,
and
we
do
contend
that
at
least
on
remand
the
nonrenewal
order
will
have
to
be
vacated
because
it
was
issued
pursuant
to
an
unconstitutional
licensing
scheme.
and
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
thank
you.
if
i'm
operating
a
radio
station
and
the
city
takes
my
license
away
because
i've
let
the
fence
around
my
tower
get
into
slight
disrepair,
and
my
defense
is
that
the
provision
of
the
ordinance
that
says
you
can
lose
your
license
for
having
your
fence
in
disrepair
slightly
is
unconstitutional,
i
can't
even
raise
that
defense
until
i
get
to
court,
and
if
i
don't
get
prompt
judicial
review
or
a
stay
of
the
status
quo
and
be
allowed
to
operate
until
my
judicial
decision,
i
will
in
all
likelihood
be
out
of
business
and
i
won't
have
any
effective
judicial
review
on
that
constitutional
defense,
and
the
administrative
process
can't
touch
that
constitutional
argument.
this
court's
decisions
are
clear
that
delay
in
a
licensing
process
can
lead
to
content
based
censorship
just
as
easy
as
lack
of
standards,
even
in
a
situation
where
licensing
decisions
are
not
expressly
based
on
the
content
of
the
material.
lakewood
i
think
also
warns
us
that
an
ongoing
business
is
a
more
likely
target
of
content
based
discrimination
in
the
licensing
process
at
the
administrative
level.
the--
mr.
jeff
s.
olson
--on
the
face
of
the
ordinance,
those
violations
may
or
may
not
be
very
serious.
nonrenewal
is
required
for
one
single,
trivial
violation
of
a
provision
of
the
ordinance
that
may
well
be
unconstitutional.
we
can't
test
the
constitutionality
of
that
provision
on
the
face
of
the
ordinance
until
we
get
to
court.
there
are
really
large
numbers
of
people
out
there,
highly
motivated,
with
influence
in
municipal
affairs,
who
are
waiting
for
this
court
to
give
them
an
opening
for
the
covert
censorship
of
sexually
explicit
speech
through
delay
of
licensure,
or
through
any
other
method
that
allows
room
for
indirect
action.
not
only
my
client,
as
an
adult
book
store,
but
other
people
who
are
engaging
in
unpopular
speech
and
mainstream
media
ask
this
court
not
to
create
that
opening
for
covert
censorship
by
delay
of
the
judicial
review
until
that
delay
becomes
fatal
to
many
businesses
who
won't
have
meaningful
judicial
review
because
they'll
just
die
on
the
vine
while
they're
waiting
for
a
judicial
decision.
a
temporary
injunction
that
they
have
to
take
the
burden
of
getting
in
circuit
court
is
not
going
to
be
an
answer.
first
of
all,
it's
the
kind
of
cumbersome
and
time
consuming
and
expensive
measure
that,
as
justice
harlan,
concurring
in
shuttlesworth,
said,
you
shouldn't
have
to
engage
in
to
pursue
your
free
speech
rights,
and
second,
it's
a
flawed
process
because
you
have
to
wait
for
the
administrative
record
to
prove
you've
got
a
chance
of
prevailing.
