mr.
curt
meitz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
denied
a
renewal
of
its
adult
license
for
committing
nine
separate
violations
of
our
municipal
code,
including
permitting
minors
to
loiter
and
allowing
sexual
activity
to
both
occur
on
the
premises.
the
city
of
waukesha
maintains
that
a
guarantee
of
a
prompt
judicial
determination,
as
required
in
freedman
in
the
context
of
a
censorship
scheme,
is
neither
applicable
or
required
for
a
licensing
ordinance
that
focuses
on
the
secondary
effects
of
such
establishments
and
targets
prior
misconduct
not
protected
by
the
constitution.
the
specific
issue
before
this
court,
which
is
before
the
court
today,
is
that...
whether
such
an
ordinance,
which
has
neither
the
effect
or
purpose
of
limiting
or
restricting
the
content
of
any
commutative
materials
must
provide
either
a
guarantee
of
a
prompt
judicial
determination,
versus
the
availability
or
access
to
prompt
judicial
review
for
administrative
decisions
that
are
made
concerning
conduct
which
is
unprotected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
curt
meitz
in
answering
your
question,
justice
souter,
this
court
said
in
the
seminal
cases,
in
the
first
and
the
plurality
of
american
mini
theatres,
and
in
renton,
that
these
types
of
establishments,
adult
establishments
do
have
a
effect
on
the
surrounding
environments.
the
court
said
in
renton,
the
majority
said
that
you
are
capable
of
regulating,
you
have
a
substantial
important
interest,
and
as
long--
mr.
curt
meitz
--as
long
as
your
regulations
are
justified
without
regard
to
the
content
of
what
they
sell,
in
this
case
what
they
sell
or
rent,
that
is
content
neutral.
certainly--
mr.
curt
meitz
--and
i
think
that
is
clear.
as
the
court...
a
plurality
stated
in
fw/pbs,
technically
this
is
a...
requires
prior
restraint
analysis,
and
we
do
initially,
we
provide
the
objective
standards
for
review,
because
if
you
don't
have,
as
the
case
was
cited
in
lakewood,
where
there
are
no
standards,
you
have
unbridled
discretion,
and
without
any
standards
there's
that
hidden
idea
of
censorship,
and
we
provide,
as
the
court
of
appeals
determined,
objective,
definitive
standards.
the
other
key
here,
as
fw
said,
is
you
must
provide,
the
licensor
must
provide
a
determination
in
a
reasonable,
specific
period
of
time.
mr.
curt
meitz
i
think
what
we're
going
to
find
here
is
certainly--
mr.
curt
meitz
--there
will
be
what
we
consider
an
incidental
burden
on
content.
there
clearly
will
be,
but
this
court
on
numerous
occasions
involving
time,
place,
and
manner
restrictions
where
you
have
in
place
some
restrictions,
as
long
as
they're
incidental,
and
incidental
as
this
court
has
defined
on
many
occasions,
is
that
the
regulation
is
essential
to
the
furtherance
of
the
interest,
and
clearly
here,
our
interest,
our
interest
in
protecting
the
health,
safety,
and
welfare
of
our
citizens,
is
geared
on
not
what
they're
selling,
not
what
they're
renting.
we're
concerned
about
keeping
minors
out
of
these
establishments.
we're
concerned
about
keeping
sexual
activity
from
occurring.
we're
concerned
about
peep
booths
not
being
obstructed,
which
would
discourage
sexual
activity.
mr.
curt
meitz
and
i--
mr.
curt
meitz
--we
would
agree
with
that.
we
believe
that
the
argument
of
administrative
determine...
of
prompt
judicial
administrative
determination
is
not
the
issue
before
the
court.
mr.
curt
meitz
absolutely.
mr.
curt
meitz
the
big
difference
is
this,
and
i
think
there
were
six
justices
in
fw/pbs
v.
dallas
that
recognized
the
distinction
between
content
based
censorship
schemes
and
the
freedman
analysis,
which
was...
required
these
safeguards
to
obviate
the
dangers
of
a
censorship
system,
and
those
licensing
ordinance
that
do
not
pass
judgment
on
the
content
of
any
commutative
material.
mr.
curt
meitz
the
reason
is,
is
the
requirement
for
a
guarantee
of
a
prompt
judicial
determination
in
freedman
is
because
the
licensing
scheme
in
maryland
was
passing
a
determination
on
the
content
of
what
is
obscenity.
this
court
has
stated,
to
obviate
the
risks
associated
with
that
the
judiciary
has
the
expertise
to
make
determinations
concerning
the
constitutionality
or
whether
a
matter
is
protected
or
unprotected.
that
is
clear,
that
an
administrative
review
body
is
not
the
final
arbiter.
if
they
want
to
declare
something
obscene
or
not,
the
burden
is
upon
them...
the
burden
upon
them
of
going
to
court
and
proving
that
is
there,
and
the
requirement
of
prompt
judicial
determination
is
because
the
judiciary
has
the
necessary
sensitivity
towards
what
is
protected
or
not
protected
versus
an
administrative
body.
mr.
curt
meitz
we
believe
that--
mr.
curt
meitz
--for
matters
involving
censorship
or
content
based
situations,
it's
clear
from
freedman
and
its
progeny,
southeastern,
that
a
prompt
judicial,
guarantee
of
a
prompt
judicial
determination
is
necessary
to
minimize
the
risk,
and
the--
mr.
curt
meitz
--yes.
mr.
curt
meitz
yes.
however,
as
the
plurality
stated
in
fw,
the
words
availability,
avenue,
and
possibility,
that
that
is
appropriate
considering
the
fact
that
what
we
are
doing
here,
the
municipality
is
not
passing
judgment
on
the
content.
what
they
sell
is
irrelevant.
we
are
making
determinations
that
are
within
our
expertise.
we
do
it
every
other
tuesday
in
the
city
of
waukesha.
mr.
curt
meitz
prompt
access,
justice
o'connor,
because
we
believe
that
the
purpose,
the
reason
for
a
prompt
judicial
determination
to
eliminate
that
discouraging
effect
on
the
individual
film
exhibitor
to
go
into
court
and
the
expertise,
which
only
the
judiciary
has,
that
is
not
applicable.
mr.
curt
meitz
not
with
regard
to
matters
that
are
not
content
based.
if
you're
making
a
determination
on
whether
minors
are
loitering
or
not,
that
is
within
the
particular
realm
of
municipal
body.
they
make
decisions
like
that
all
the
time,
and
that
decision
is,
in
effect,
final,
unless
there
is
an
appeal
taken,
and
that's
clearly
unlike
the
censorship
scheme,
where
you
have
to
go
to
court
maryland,
if
you
want
this
to
be
declared
obscene
you
better
get
authorization--
mr.
curt
meitz
--the
reason
it
would
not
be
required,
you
have
to
look
at
the
underlying
rationale
of
freedman
and
why
freedman
required
a
prompt
judicial
determination,
because
of
specifically
what
the
court
said...
filed
like,
the
37
photographs.
you
are
not
in
the
position,
censor...
you
are...
you're
in
the
business
of
censoring,
and
you
are
not
sensitive
to
the
protected
versus
unprotected
speech.
mr.
curt
meitz
this
is
true,
and
i
think
as
you
pointed
out
earlier
the
deferential
standard
of
review
exists
virtually
in
every
state
that
i'm
aware
of.
it's
pointed
out
by
the
solicitor
general,
is
whether
there...
whether
the
administrative
body
was
arbitrary
and
capricious,
exercises
will
versus
its
judgment.
mr.
curt
meitz
if
you're
obviously
not
trying
to--
mr.
curt
meitz
--control
the
content,
but
if
it's
like
you
said--
mr.
curt
meitz
--rats,
or
whatever,
i
would
say,
absolutely,
because
if
you...
you
have
an
interest
in
maintaining
the
sanitation
and
health
of
the
community--
mr.
curt
meitz
--and
if
there
happened
to
be
a
licensing
scheme
that
allowed
them
to
be
shut
down,
i
think
the
municipality
would
have
a
real
substantial
interest
in
controlling,
and
as
part
of
its
public--
mr.
curt
meitz
--i
would
agree
with
that,
but
i
think,
again
i
bring
the
court
back
to
the
seminal
cases
of
american
mini
theatres
and
renton.
the
court
recognized
that
these
secondary
effects
associated
with
such
establishments
are
important
and
substantial,
and
they
allow
the
municipality
some
flexibility
with
dealing
with
these
very
serious
problems,
so
yes,
in
a
sense--
mr.
curt
meitz
--renton
and
mini
theatres
was
a
licensing,
albeit
you're
correct,
justice
stevens,
it
did
involve
the
zoning,
but
i
think
there
have
been
other
cases
since
then,
and
i'll
use...
although
not
in
the
adult
book
scheme,
but
i
will
mention
ward
v.
rock
against
racism,
where
there
was
a
clear
burden,
or
incidental
burden
placed
upon
speech
from
the
standpoint
of
how
loud
the
music
could
be
in
central
park,
and
the
interests
of
the
municipality
being,
you
know,
the
neighbors
around
central
park
had
the
right
to
quiet
enjoyment--
mr.
curt
meitz
--well,
the
court
there
analyzed
that
as
intermediate
scrutiny,
time,
place,
and
manner
restriction.
mr.
curt
meitz
i'm
not
sure
if
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
curt
meitz
yes.
mr.
curt
meitz
yes.
mr.
curt
meitz
i...
the
reason
we
brought
this
issue
to
the
court's
attention,
and
for
the
very
limited,
unique
situation,
was
the
issue
upon
which
you
granted
review,
and
that
is
whether
you
require
a
prompt
judicial
determination.
the
fact
whether
it
was
expedited
or
not,
they
were
not
injured.
they
were
allowed
to
stay
open,
and
that...
again,
we
would
prefer
that
this
matter
be
litigated
on
the
merits.
we
have
many
municipalities--
mr.
curt
meitz
--i
would
cite
asarco
from
the
standpoint
at
least
that
you
have
to
have
some
kind
of
likelihood
of
redress
that's
available
from
this
court,
and
it's
very
speculative
at
this
point
in
time.
mr.
curt
meitz
only
since
the
court
granted
this
petition
for
review,
we
felt
it
was
our
obligation
to
bring
it
to
your
attention
because
of
the
limited
issue
upon
which
you
granted
the
review,
not
because
we
amended
the
ordinance.
mr.
curt
meitz
i
think
it's
distinguished
from
pap's,
because
one,
as
the
court
stated
in
pap's,
they
were...
this
is
clearly
not
an
attempt
by
us...
they
arrived
at
a
favorable
decision
from
the
lower
court,
number
1.
number
2,
we
don't
know
what...
as
justice
o'connor
said
in
pap's,
there's
some
ongoing
injury
that
occurred
in
that
case
to
the
city
of
erie--
mr.
curt
meitz
--and
that's
exactly
why
we
brought
that
to
the
attention--
mr.
curt
meitz
--yes,
and
we
look
at
it,
if
the
court
would
have
granted
cert
on
all
issues
that
would
have
been
a
different
case,
because
that
might,
if
you
were...
the
standards
issued,
or
there
was
some
impartiality
question
of
city
of
waukesha
panel,
then
that
would
maybe
undermine
the
entire
licensing
process,
but
this
was
a
very
limited
issue,
and
we
fail
to
see
how
this...
how
they
are
harmed
by
this,
or
there's
any
redress
likely
by
this
court.
the
court
here
is...
there's
21,000
municipalities
in
this
country,
approximately,
all
of
which
have
a
substantial
interest
and...
in
seeing...
preserving
the
quality
of
urban
life
in
america.
mr.
curt
meitz
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
curt
meitz
they're
closing
down
this
week.
mr.
curt
meitz
we
don't
believe
so,
because
of
the
narrow
issue
before
the
court.
mr.
curt
meitz
they
could
be
granted
a
license
if
they
were...
if
they're
found
not
to
have
committed
a
violation
over
the
past
5
years.
the
offices--
mr.
curt
meitz
--if
they
don't
operate,
no,
we
would
not
give
them
a
license.
mr.
curt
meitz
no.
