mr.
meitz,
if
some
kind
of
provision
for
prompt
administrative
review
is
required
in
these
license
revocation
cases,
do
you
think
this
court
has
ever
decided
whether
the
ensuing
judicial
review,
whether
it
has
to
provide
for
a
prompt
decision
or
just
prompt
access
to
the
courts,
to
courts
having
a
power
to
maintain
the
status
quo
if
the
appropriate
showing
is
made.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
a
difference
between
access
and
final
decision
and
what
do
you
think
our
cases
hold
in
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--you
mean
final
determination?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
opposed
to
access?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
not
clear
on
what
you
think
is
necessary.
is
it
necessary
here
that
there
be
a
provision
on
the
face
of
the
statute
for
prompt
final
judicial
decision,
or
just
prompt
access
to
the
court
for
judicial
review?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
mean
access
to
review,
as
opposed
to
decision
making?
