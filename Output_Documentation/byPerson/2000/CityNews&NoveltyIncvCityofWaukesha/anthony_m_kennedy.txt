justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it's
different
than
freedman,
in
the
sense
that
freedman
was
expressly
designed
to
permit
or
not
permit
speech
based
solely
on
its
content.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
seems
to
me
this
is
not
that
at
all.
i
recognize
the
analogy,
but
freedman
is
not
directly
controlling,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
do
you
agree
that
it's
required?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
what's
the
difference
between
an
administrative
delay,
which
you
concede
the
constitution
prohibits,
and
a
judicial
delay?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
sense
would
it
make
for
the
court
to
have
strict
rules
about
administrative
expedition
but
not
judicial,
other
than
what
justice...
the
line
of
questions
justice
scalia
was
indicating,
that
there
is
authority
to
issue
a
stay?
other
than
that,
what
would
be
the
reason?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me
it
would
go
the
other
way
around.
if
the
administrative
agency
has
expertise,
and
it's
required
to
expedite,
in
your
case,
but
the
judiciary
doesn't,
then
you're
allowing
the
entity
without
expertise
to
delay.
that
seems
to
me,
you
have
it
backwards.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
go
back
to
my
earlier
question.
if
the
premise
is
that
the
constitution
requires
expedition
at
the
administrative
level,
why
doesn't
it
have
the
same
requirement
at
the
judicial
level?
expertise
can't
be
the
answer,
because
that
works
against
you,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
think
the
availability
of
temporary
relief
on
a
substantial
showing
is
a
necessary
component
of
the
review?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
take
it
that
the
classic
thornhill
doctrine,
where
i'm
allowed
to
raise
somebody
else's
rights,
is
because
it's
a
content
based
statute,
and
this
is
not
content
based.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
explain
to
me
why
the
administrator
must
act
promptly,
but
the
judiciary
does
not?
