justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
suppose
a
book
store,
or
a
newspaper
has
to...
they're
in
a
building,
and
i
guess
they
can't
have
holes
in
the
floors
and
unsafe
electricity
and
maybe
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
run
a
business
if
they
did.
they
don't
have
to
meet...
for
that
safe
electricity
or
working
conditions
and
so
forth
there
isn't
some
special
test,
is
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
are
the
violations
here
targeted
at
speech?
i
believe
that
the
accusation
was
they
were...
involve
conduct,
nothing
to
do
with
speech
in
the
books
in
the
store.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
so
you
have
a
book
store,
and
it
says
you
can
have
a
license
to
sell
a
book
store,
open
your
book
store
provided
there
isn't
electricity
running
all
over
the
floor
and
electrocuting
people.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
then
subject
to
some
special
test
because
it's
a
book
store?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
sufficient
if
they
decide
your
case...
if
the
circuit...
you
have
some
claim
on
the
merits.
you
say
they're
arbitrary
in
taking
away
my
license.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
all
right,
you
say
this,
we
have
a
claim
on
the
merits,
and
you
say,
judge,
decide
it.
decide
it
before
we
have
to
close
down.
now,
if
they
do,
it's
fine,
right?
you
have
no
complaint
as
long
as
the
judge
decides
your
claim
on
the
merits
before
you
have
to
shut
the
door.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
i'm
not
saying
about
this
case.
suppose
it
was
always
true
that
the
judges
would
decide
on
the
merits
before
anyone
had
to
shut
the
door.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no
problem,
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine,
then
why
aren't
you
better
off,
not
worse
off,
if
the
court
decides
a
stay
before
you
have
to
shut
down,
for
after
all,
a
court
will
give
you
the
stay
as
long
as
there's
a
reasonable
probability
of
success,
but
the
court
will
allow
you
to
stay
open
on
the
merits
only
if
you're
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
to
win,
you
have
to
win,
so
you're
easier...
it's
easier
for
you
to
get
the
stay
than
it
is
to
win.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe,
is
it
standing?
i
mean,
as
i
understand
it
you're
saying...
you're
complaining
about
a
procedural
flaw,
call
it
x.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
as
far
as
your
client
is
concerned,
x
never
happened
to
him.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
far
as
your
client
was
concerned,
it's
now
been
determined
that
he
violated
the
statute
on
the
merits.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
your
client
says,
i'm
out
of
business
anyway,
i've
made
an
agreement
not
to
try
to
get
back
into
it.
now,
it
sounds
as
if
that
should
violate
some
prudential
principle.
i
just--
[laughter]
i'm
not
totally
sure
which
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you've
looked
into
this
more
thoroughly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
just
like
to
get
quickly
your...
what's
the
procedural
doctrine
that...
is...
look,
they're
complaining
about
x.
they
weren't
hurt
by
x.
they've
decided
definitely
they're
not
entitled
to
a
license
anyway
and
they're
going
out
of
business,
all
right.
they've
agreed
to
that,
and
yet
they
want
to
complain
about
x.
what's
the
procedural
doctrine
that
bars
them?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
don't
think
they
ought
to
be
here
making
this
argument.
you
called
it
moot,
or...
we
just
went--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--remember
what
i
just
went
through
with
him?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
know,
what's
the
procedural
doctrine
that
says
we
can't
get
to
the
merits
of
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
just
want
the
name
of
the
doctrine.
what
is
the
law
that
stops
them
from
doing--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
is
the...
is
this
any
more
moot
than
pap's
and
erie
was
moot?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
difference
seemed
to
me
to
be,
in
pap's
it's
solely
a
question
of
mootness.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
additional
thing
is
that
they
were
never
hurt
by
the
provision
of
which
they're
complaining.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
and
i'm
trying
to
look
for
the
doctrinal
handle.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
how
does
he
have
the
right
to
raise
the
claims
of
people
who
are
not
here
whom
would
be
affected
by
this
procedural
provision,
when
he
himself
is
not
affected
by
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he's
saying
the
whole
thing
is
unconstitutional
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
doesn't
have
sufficiently
quick
judicial
review,
which
he
himself
wouldn't
have
been
affected
by.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
think
of
another
case
where
it
was
that
distant
and
somebody
was
allowed
to
raise
somebody's
first
amendment
rights
when
the
other
people
were
perfectly
able
to
raise
it
themselves?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even
though
it
doesn't
affect
them
at
all.
even
though
they're
not
affected
and
the
other
people--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
if
the
theory
is
if
he
goes
for
renewal
again
and
he's
not
going
back
into
the
business,
it's
a
little
far
fetched,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--am
i
wrong,
i
was
thinking,
look,
normally
where
your
courts
are
at
stake
a
preliminary
injunction
is
good
enough,
but
that
isn't
good
enough
where
it's
the
administrator,
because
the
administrator
might
not
be
as
fair.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
reason
that
you
have
to
protect
them
more
about...
against
the
administrator
than
a
judge
is,
you
think,
well,
the
judge
will
be
fair.
he
sees
irreparable
injury,
and
if
there's
some
probability
of
success
he'll
give
you
the
injunction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
have
to
be
tougher
than
that
on
administrators,
because
they're
already
taken
a
side
and
they're
not
judicial
and
so
forth.
