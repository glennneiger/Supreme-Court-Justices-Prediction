we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
99-1680,
city
news
and
novelty,
inc.
v.
the
city
of
waukesha.
mr.
olson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
olson--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--is
this
a
speech
licensing
scheme?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
another
freedman
type
case,
wasn't
it,
where
the
performance
could
not
go
on
under
the
existence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
held...
was
it
the
supreme
court,
or
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
what
you're
asking
for
was
not
required
here,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
under
that
holding,
if
you
went
into
the
circuit
court
of
waukesha
county
you
might
get
a
stay
and
you
might
not.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
couldn't
you
argue
that
the
administrative
determination
by
the
city
was
arbitrary
or
capricious?
isn't
that
a
ground
for
judicial
review
of
an
administrative
order?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
position
basically
is,
even
though
your
claim
substantively
has
no
merit,
you're
still
entitled
to
an
automatic
stay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
olson,
does
the
fact
that
you're
making
a
facial
constitutional
challenge
here
in
your
view
make
any
difference
on
the
question
of
mootness
or
ripeness?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
olson.
mr.
meitz,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
there
something,
too,
to
the
idea
that
when
you
get
into
court,
you're
dealing
with
a
neutral
tribunal,
whereas
perhaps
the
administrative
tribunal
might
be
thought
not
to
be
neutral.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
court
would
want
to
inquire
into
why
only
radio
stations
were
prohibited
from
having
rats
in
them,
as
opposed
to
every
other
kind
of
business,
i
suppose.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
meitz.
mr.
feldman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
olson,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-1680,
city
news
&
novelty
inc.
versus
the
city
of
waukesha
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
