mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it's
our
position
that
the
city's
ordinance
in
this
case
satisfies
first
amendment
procedural
standards
in
that
prompt
judicial
review
is
available
and
therefore
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
i
think
that
actually
is
the
question
on
which
the
courts
of
appeals
were
divided,
and
that's
the
question
that
the
court
ought
to
reach
and
decide,
whether
what's
necessary
is
access
to
prompt
judicial
review,
or
a
final
judicial
determination
on
the
merits
within
a
particular
period
of
time.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
all
of
the...
at
least
all
of
the
court
of
appeals
decisions
i
think
were
initial
licenses.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
i
do.
i
think
there
are
differences
in
a
due
process
analysis
between
someone
who
has
applied
for
renewal
of
a
license
and
hasn't
gotten
the
renewal
and
has
a
property
interest,
perhaps,
in
that
license,
and
that
may
have
due
process
implications,
but
i
think
from
the
standpoint
of
the
first
amendment
the
question
is,
is
there
going
to
be
a
period
of
time
during
which
the
expression
doesn't
occur,
or
does
occur,
and
it's
just
an
interest
in
expression,
and
it
doesn't
matter
whether
before
that
time
the
person
was
licensed
and
had...
expression
occurred
or
not.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
that's
true.
i
think
that
status
quo
issue
has
to...
may
have
to
do
with
a
due
process
analysis.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
from
the
standpoint
of
the
first
amendment,
the
court's
references
in
freedman
and
the
other
cases
to
maintaining
the
status
quo
was...
in
the
context
of
those
cases
what
that
meant
is,
there
can
be
a
period
of
time
during
which
the
expression
doesn't
occur,
and
i
think
that's
the
same
principle
that
applies
here.
there
can
be
a
period
of
time
in
this
case
pending
judicial
review,
as
long
as
the
judicial
review
is
available,
during
which
the
expression
doesn't
occur.
i
think
what's
necessary
in
this
context
is,
the
license
applicant
has
to
have
the
availability
of...
has
to
be
able
to
go
immediately
into
court
once
the
administrative
decision
is
made,
the
licensee
has
to
have
the
ability
to
get
temporary
or
preliminary
relief
if
the
facts
of
the
case
warrant
it,
and
there
has
to
be
no
particular
obstacles
that
are
placed
in
the
licensee's
way,
and
if
all
of
that
is
satisfied,
then
the
court
is
in
the
position
to
safeguard
the
licensee's
interest
and
no
further
requirements
are
necessary.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it's
not
directly
presented
here,
because
that
is
available
under
this
statute,
but
yes,
i
think
it's
probably...
if
you
had
a
scheme...
and
they
are
unusual,
but
i
think
they
may
exist
here
and
there.
where
a
court
doesn't
have
the
power
to
grant
the
temporary
relief,
i
think
that
would
raise
other...
that
would
raise
first
amendment
concerns.
i
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
it's
our
position
that
essentially
for
the
reasons
given
by
the
petitioner,
that,
although
it
might
be
a
close
question,
the
case
is
probably
not
moot.
there
still
is
some
continuing
interest
that
the
petitioner
has
in
the
case.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i'm
really
not
aware
of
the
economics
that
lead
to
that.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
that
his...
i
think
his
basic
claim
is
this,
is
this
procedure
that
the
city's
put
into
effect,
this
licensing
procedure,
is
unconstitutional,
and
therefore
i
don't
really
even
need
a
license,
or
if
i
need
a
license,
i
ought
to
be
able
to
get
one
immediately.
that's
the
basic
claim
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right,
but
i...
the
fact
that
in
this
particular
case
he
wouldn't
have
been
affected
by
it--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i
think
the
fw/pbs
case,
for
example,
or
in
the
lakewood
case,
i
think
in
a
couple
of
those
cases
you've
had
people
who
say,
that
there
are
these...
that
there
are
first
amendment
procedural
safeguards
that
are
required,
and
the
party
is
able
to
go
into
court
and
say,
his
claim
is
that
the
scheme
is
unconstitutional.
now,
i'm
not...
we
don't
agree
that
it
is--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--they're
not
affected
in
this
case.
i
suppose
the
theory
would
be
that
when
he
goes
for
renewal
again
he
might
be
affected,
or
that
he--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
i
think...
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right,
and
i
think
that's
the
crucial...
this
is
not
contents
based,
it's
true,
but
although
in
the
fw/pbs
case,
which
was
identical
to
this
in
terms
of
whether
it
was
content
based,
the
court
said
the
party
could
also
raise
these
procedural
interests,
first
amendment
interests,
could
make
a
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
that
scheme.
i
do
think
that
on
the
merits
the
important...
the
crucial
point
here
is
that
the
decisions
the
city
makes
are
not
content
based.
unlike
in
a
situation
like
freedman,
where
the
court
said,
this
court
said
that
a
reviewing
court
has
to
be
able...
has
to...
is
necessary,
because
what
the
state
was
doing
was
looking
at
the
particular
movie
and
making
a
judgment
based
on
that
content
about
whether
that
movie
should
be
allowed.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
i
hope
so.
i
think
in...
in
fw/pbs
what
the
court
held
was
that
some
of
the
freedman
requirements
are
not
necessary
in
this
context
and,
in
particular,
it
said
the
city
doesn't
have
to
go
to
court.
you
can
let
the
other
party
go
to
court
and
the
city
doesn't
have
to
bear
the
burden
of
proof
when
it
goes
to
court,
and
i
think
the
point
of
that
decision
was
that
the
municipal
decision
here,
since
it's
not
content
based,
can
be
allowed
to
go
into
effect
and
have
final
effect
even
with
no
judge
ever
looking
at
it.
in
the
freedman
context,
it's
quite
different.
in
the
freedman
context,
what
the
court
was
saying,
we
don't
want
this
censor's
decision
to
go
into
effect
for
any
significant
period
of
time
without
a
judge
looking
at
it.
it's
not
really
a
final
determination
of
law
until
you
go
into
court,
until
a
judge
has
a
chance
to
look
at
it
and
decide
whether
the
material--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--is
constitutionally
protected.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
i
was
only
making
the
point
that
there
was
a
unique
feature
present
in
a
freedman
type
case,
which
is,
you
don't
want
any
effect
to
be
given,
or
any
substantial
effect
to
be
given
to
the
administrative
decision
because
it's
a
content
based
decision
on
the
content
of
that
speech.
you
don't
want
any
effect
to
be
given
to
that,
basically,
until
it
gets
into
court.
here,
the
point
of
fw/pbs
was,
that
can
have
some
effect
as
long
as
the
proper
procedures
are
required,
and--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no.
no,
but
i
do
think
that
the
freedman
safeguards
were
designed
so
that
it
has
a
very
limited
effect,
and
that
was
the
reason
why
in
freedman
you
needed
the
judicial
determination,
not
just
the
access
to
the
judge,
to
be
within
a
very
prompt
period
of
time,
because
there
was
a
concern
that
that
administrative
decision
just
shouldn't
have
a
final
effect
until...
not
for
a
very
long
time,
only
for
the
minimum
possible
time,
until
the
judge
decides
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that
would,
but
i
think
you
could
look
at
the
freedman
decision--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--excuse
me.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
stay,
in
my
view,
in
our
view
those
are
really
procedural
due
process
issues
and
not
first
amendment
issues,
but
i
think
that
would
be
sufficient.
i
think
you
can
look
at
the
court's
decision
in
freedman
as
essentially
saying
that
the...
saying
that
either
a
judge
has
to
grant
a
stay
in
each
one
of
these
cases
regardless
of
the
merits,
or
there
has
to
be
a
prompt
judicial
determination
within
a
very
short
period
of
time.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct,
but
i...
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
but
i
do
think
the
difference
is
that
in
the
initial...
whether,
in...
under
a
procedural
due
process
analysis
there
is
a
difference.
for
the
first
amendment
the
question
is,
is
that
speech
occurring
during
that
period
of
time,
and
how
long
a
period
of
time
can
that
be
allowed
to
happen.
the
decisions
that
the
city
makes
in
a
scheme
like
this
are
decisions
about
things
like
whether
there
were
minors
in
the
store,
what
was
the
age
of
the
people,
were
they
there,
were
they
not
there,
were
the
booths
covered
or
were
they
not
covered
so
that
you
could
be
able
to
tell
what
was
going
on
inside
them,
was
there
sexual
activity
that
some
of
the
patrons
were
engaging
in
or
not.
those
are
very,
very
different
from
the
kinds
of
decisions
that
were
made
in
the
freedman
context,
and
since
those
decisions
are
the
kinds
of
things
that
municipalities
make
in
generally
in
enforcing
police
power
type
ordinances,
there's
no
reason
for
them
not
to
be
given,
in
fact,
when
they
make
them.
