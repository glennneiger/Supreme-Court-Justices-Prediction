stevens
but
isn't
it
also
have
an
air
of
unreality
because
your
client
is
not
in
business
any
more
and
doesn't
intend
to
go
back
into
business,
as
i
understand
the
proceedings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
isn't
the
case
moot?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there's
a
disability
for
licensure
for
a
business
he
has
no
intention
of
engaging
in,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
the
impression...
i
may
be
unfair
to
you...
that
you
may
be
representing
interests
other
than
the
named
party
to
the
case
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
sufficient
interest
to
finance
extensive
litigation
in
the
united
states
supreme
court.
i
guess
that's
the
answer,
right,
and
of
course
he's
paying
the
bills,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
add
one
fact
before
you
answer
justice
breyer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
generally
the
purpose
of
the
facial
challenge
is
to
protect
third
parties
who
may
not
be
before
the
court,
but
here,
is
it
not
a
fact
that
the
third
parties
are
largely,
maybe
not
entirely
protected
by
the
amendment
to
the
ordinance,
from
the
very
danger
that
you're
seeking...
the
very
principle
you're
seeking
to
vindicate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
those
cases
just
dealt
with
the
location
of
the
business.
they
didn't
go
into
procedures
at
all,
renton
and
mini
theatres.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
again,
that
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
timing
of
the
decision,
as
i
remember
it,
did
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
feldman,
are
those
cases
involving
renewals,
or
initial
issuance
of
licenses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
considerations
are
the
same
in
the
two
situations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
the
status
quo
is
entirely
different,
because
in
one
case
the
status
quo
is
that
the
first
amendment
materials
are
being
sold,
and
in
the
other
they're
not
in...
they're
not
being
sold.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that
would
be
changing
the
status
quo.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
be
changing
the
status
quo.
the
state
problem
is
different
in
the
two
situations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
stay
in
the
case
involving
an
initial
issue,
a
stay
would
be
a
mandate
to
grant
the
license,
rather
than
a
stay
to
maintain
the
status
quo.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's
really
not
a
stay,
it's
more
of
a
mandamus.
