justice
david
h.
souter
but
those
third
parties
will
be
in
exactly
the
position
that
your
client
has
been
in
during
the
course
of
this
litigation,
isn't
that
correct?
what
i'm
getting
at
is,
the
kind
of
the
classic
third
party
right
that
we
recognize
is
the
right
in
the
case
in
which
the
individual
defendant
in
effect
says,
yeah,
as
applied
to
me
the
ordinance
is
perfectly
constitutional,
but
there
are
these
other
people
and
as
to
them
it
would
not
be.
but
here
your
client
is
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
the
other
people,
and
should
that
make
a
difference?
one
reason
why
it
might
make
a
difference
is,
if
it
turns
out
that
this
supposedly
facially
invalid
ordinance
in
practice
is
applied
in
a
perfectly
valid
way
to
you,
should
we
therefore
assume
that
it
will
be
different
when
the
ordinance
is
applied
to
third
parties?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
i'm
wondering
whether
you're
really
in
a
situation
in
which
our
cases
recognize
your
right
to
raise
a
third
party
right
where
you're
in
the
same
boat
with
them.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
aren't
you
in
the
same
boat
with
them?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
say
our
cases
prevent
me
from
making
that
assumption.
why
aren't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
we
have
been
misconstruing
your
argument.
is
your
argument
not
that
there
is
a
third
party
right
that
you
were
raising,
but
an
argument
that
even
as
to
you
in
this
case,
in
which
you
were
allowed
to
operate
as
the
proceedings
progressed,
even
as
to
you
in
this
case,
the
statute
was
simply
flatly
unconstitutional
and
therefore
the
entire
proceeding
was
unconstitutional,
even
though
you
weren't
shut
down
pending
the
determination.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
we
accept
your
statement
of
the
question,
i
think
it's
perhaps
an
easier
case
than
i
believe
they
mean
to
bring,
because
i
think
part
of
their
point
is
that
even
under
a
scheme
which
is
justified
on
the
secondary
effects
analysis,
so
it's
not
content
based
in
the
classic
sense,
even
under
that
scheme,
there
is
still
going
to
be
a
content
restriction
on
speech
if
this
establishment
is
shut
down,
and
that
is
true
simply
because
the
nature
of
the
establishment
is
rather
content
specific,
so
you're
going
to
have
a
content...
you're
going
to
have
an
effect
which
is
correlated
to
content,
so
that's
why
i
wonder
if
it's
fair
for
you
to
say
that
the
ordinance
does
not
have
the
effect,
in
addition
to
not
having
the
purpose
of
a
content
restriction,
because
i
think
they're
saying
it
does
have
the
effect
of
a
content
restriction,
and
that's
why
you
ought
to
have
some
safeguards.
justice
david
h.
souter
no
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
is
content
neutral
for
certain
purposes,
but
he
is
saying
that
there
ought
to
be
some
procedural
safeguard
that
recognizes
the
fact
that
even
these
so
called
content
neutral
limitations
based
on
secondary
effects
do
have
an
effect
on
speech,
and
that
effect
is
at
least
very
closely
correlated
with
content,
and
he's
saying
that
for
that
reason,
even
though
you
can
regulate
it...
that's
not
being
contested,
is
it,
as
a
broad
proposition...
even
though
you
can
regulate
it,
there
ought
to
be
some
limits
on
your
regulation
because
of
the
damage
that
you
can
do
and
do
on
a
content
basis,
in
effect.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
think,
and
i
don't
want
to
cut
you
off,
but
i
think
what
you're
saying...
and
this
may
be
fine,
but
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
it.
you're
saying,
yes,
so
long
as
we
meet
certain
conditions,
not
all
the
conditions
he
wants,
we
can
have
an
effect
on
content.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
we
accept
that
and
he
accepts
that.
all
he's
saying
is,
if
you're
going
to
regulate
on
that
perfectly
legitimate
basis,
you've
got
to
do
it
promptly.
that's
the
argument.
why
can't
you
do
it
promptly--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
therefore
why
is
it
a
burden?
i
mean,
that
seems
to
me
what
the
issue
is
in
this
case.
why
is
it
a
burden
that
you
should
not
carry?
justice
david
h.
souter
may...
i'm
sorry,
may
i
just
go
back
to
this
other
issue,
and
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
about
your
ordinance.
they're
out
of
business
now,
i
take
it.
they're
not...
they
don't
wish
to
operate
at
the
moment.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
if
they
were
to
win
their
case,
would
they
be
entitled
to
a
license
renewal
under
your
ordinance,
even
though
they
do
not
at
the
present
time
wish
to
operate
the
business?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
not...
no,
but
i'm
not
asking
about
the
issue
before
the
court.
i'm
asking
a
question
about
your
ordinance.
if
they
were
to
win
this
case
and
they
come
to
you
and
say,
we
don't
intend
to
operate
this
business,
but
we'd
like
a
license,
does
your
ordinance
provide
for
granting
them
a
license?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
license
businesses
that
don't
intend
to
operate?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
was
my
question.
as
i
understand
it,
they
don't
intend
to
operate.
they
say,
okay,
we've
won
our
case.
we
don't
intend
to
operate,
give
us
a
license.
can
they
get
a
license
under
your
ordinance?
