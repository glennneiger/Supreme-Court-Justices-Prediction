justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
claiming
that
any
of
the
reasons
that
were
given...
this
is
a
case
of
a
license
that
was
in
existence,
and
it
was...
it's
a
nonrenewal
case,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
nonrenewal
was
based
on
violation,
alleged
violation
of
the
terms
of
the
license.
are
you
contesting
that
any
of
those
terms,
like
no
minors
on
the
premises,
open
booths,
that
any
of
those
terms
violate
the
first
amendment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
get
that
from
freedman,
because
freedman,
the
status
quo
was
no
speech.
that
is,
the
court
said
you
must
have
a
graphic
procedure,
because
you're
not
allowing
someone
to
speak.
here,
a
speaker
has
been
permitted
to
speak,
has
a
license,
and
the
question
is
whether
it
will
be
renewed.
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
you're
asking
for,
the
continued
speech
is
the
status
quo,
as
distinguished
from
freedman,
where
no
speech
was
the
status
quo.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
really...
is
that
really
your
principle?
as
i
understand
your
case,
it's
not
prompt
judicial
review
as
such,
as
was
the
case
in
freedman,
but
here
you
would
be
delighted
to
have
delayed
judicial
review
as
long
as
you
keep
your
license
until
judicial
review
is
over,
so
what
you're
really
saying,
it's
not
a
question
of
prompt,
it's
a
question
of
until
the
end
of
the
judicial
road,
however
long
that
road
is,
your
license
can't
be
revoked.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
if
that's
the
case
it's
nothing
to
do
with
the
promptness
of
judicial
review.
it's
simply
that
you
retain
your
license
until
judicial
review
is
over,
however
long
it
takes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
has
an
air
of
unreality
to
it,
because
in
fact
your
client
did
get
a
stay
until
the
end
of
the
judicial
road
without
making
a
showing
of
probability
of
success
on
the
merits
and,
in
fact,
the
entire
case
has
been
now
adjudicated
on
the
merits,
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
is
a...
there
was
a...
i
forgot
what
the
title
of
the
case
was,
but
a
decision
of
this
court
explaining
that
if
you
were
entitled
to
something
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
right,
due
process,
like
notice,
it
doesn't
matter
that
the
notice
provision
isn't
in
the
law
itself,
as
long
as
the
court
insists
on
it.
then
you
have
no
constitutional
right
that
has
been
violated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
do
you
have...
all
we
know
is
in
your
case
you
were
allowed
to
remain
in
operation
until
the
end
of
the
line.
do
you...
is
there
anything
in
this
record
to
show
that
that
doesn't
routinely
happen?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
saying
in
another
case
someone
else
might
suffer
the
violation
of
a
constitutional
right,
but
certainly
that
has
not
been
your
experience,
and
i
don't
know
why
we
shouldn't
assume
that
other
cases
would
proceed
in
this
same
pattern
and
not
in
some
other
pattern.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
also,
usually
a
champion
comes
forward
and
says,
other
people
are
going
to
be
chilled,
but
in
this
case
not
only
aren't
others
chilled
from
getting
into
this
business,
but
you're
being
edged
out
not
because
of
any
ordinance,
but
because
a
bigger
player
has
taken
over
and
there's
not...
and
has
squeezed
you
out
of
the
market.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
are
perfectly
adequate
champion
of
themselves.
it's
not
like
the
person
who
is
going
to
be
afraid
to
demonstrate
for
fear
of
being
arrested.
it's...
i
don't
see
any
chill
of
people
like,
what
is
it,
the
b...
whatever
the
organization
that
has
come
into
this
town
with
a
bigger
and
better
adult
book
shop.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
called
it
moot.
you
did
label
it
mootness,
as
opposed
to
standing,
because
i
suppose,
on
the
theory
that
going
in,
when
this
whole
thing
started,
they
appeared
to
be...
to
have
a
live
interest
in
this,
but
now
at
the
end
of
the
line
they
haven't
maintained
that
interest.
i
thought
that's
what
you
were
saying,
but
maybe
not.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
feldman,
does
the
government
have
a
position
on
mootness,
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
or
the
justiciability
of
this
case
at
this
time
in
its
current
posture?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
i
don't
understand
why
the
proper
answer
isn't,
because
there
is
this
danger,
the
court
will
look
at
it
case
by
case
and
if,
indeed,
this
is
a
situation
where
the
administrator
is
abusing
authority
to
disguise
what
is
really
content
based
regulation,
the
court
can
say
in
that
situation,
we
put
a
freeze
on
it.
we
allow
you
to
keep
your
license
pending
the
decision.
but
if
there's
no
basis
for
that,
so
that
it
is
just
a
time,
place,
and
manner
type
restraint,
why
should
you
be
able
to
maintain
the
status
quo,
which
is,
allowed
to
go
on
with
the
business,
in
face
of
very
serious
charges
of
violations
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
content
of
the
books
and
tapes
that
are
sold?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
a
person
is
denied
a
license
to
conduct
an
adult
business,
a
term
used
to
describe
“shops
selling
sexually
explicit
reading
and
viewing
material”,
we
have
said
in
a
prior
opinion
that
the
first
amendment
entitles
to
would
be
licensee
to
prompt
judicial
review.
some
lower
courts
have
concluded
that
prompt
review
means
a
prompt
decision
on
the
merits
of
the
individuals
asserted
right
to
conduct
an
adult
business.
other
courts
have
said
that
fast
access
to
a
judge
without
setting
a
deadline
for
the
judge’s
decision
is
good
enough.
we
granted
review
to
resolve
this
conflict
after
full
consideration,
however,
we
find
that
this
case
in
not
one
in
which
we
can
address
the
issue.
city
news
&
novelty
the
party
who
sought
our
review
was
an
adult
business
in
waukesha,
wisconsin.
one
cannot
conduct
such
a
business
in
waukesha
without
an
annually
renewable
license.
in
1995,
waukesha
decided
not
to
renew
city
news’
license
finding
that
the
business
had
violated
various
city
rules,
for
example,
a
bar
on
allowing
minors
in
the
premises.
city
news
challenged
waukesha’s
licensing
laws
in
wisconsin’s
courts.
the
wisconsin
court
of
appeals
rejected
the
challenge
concluding
among
other
things
that
prompt
access
to
court
review
without
a
guarantee
of
prompt
decision
suffices
to
satisfy
the
constitution.
city
news
contest
that
judgment
here.
the
opinion
we
release
today
explains
why
city
news
is
not
properly
situated
to
challenge
the
adequacy
of
waukesha’s
provision
for
a
court
check
on
license
denials.
since
petitioning
for
our
review
city
news
has
ceased
to
operate
as
an
adult
business
and
it
no
longer
seeks
license
renewal.
because
no
live
immediate
controversy
persisted
and
that
this
case
is
what
lawyer
call
moot,
city
news
urges
that
its
complaint
against
waukesha
remains
fit
for
resolution
because
the
business
might
some
day
seek
another
license
but
under
the
city's
ordinance
it
must
wait
five
years
before
reapply.
we
cannot
tell
from
the
record
before
us
whether
city
news
would
in
fact
face
a
five
year
wait.
we
conclude
in
any
event
that
a
live
controversy
is
not
maintained
by
speculation
that
city
news
might
be
disabled
from
reentering
the
business
that
city
news
has
now
left
and
currently
asserts
no
plan
to
reenter.
city
news
is
not
a
qualified
complainant
for
a
separate
reason
as
well.
when
the
business
just
starting
out
is
denied
a
license
that
business
cannot
operate,
courts
have
divided
on
the
face
of
judicial
review
to
which
such
a
new
business
is
entitled
but
city
news
was
not
just
starting
out,
it
was
already
up
and
running.
city
news
therefore
did
not
seek
swift
review
of
a
license
denial
to
enable
the
enterprise
to
begin
operating,
a
business
long
underway
typically
seeks
not
to
start
but
to
stay
in
business
to
gain
a
stay
of
license
terminations
during
dependency
of
judicial
review,
however,
along
that
review
take.
we
venture
no
opinion
on
the
merits
of
a
plea
for
a
stay
of
license
termination
allowing
an
adult
business
to
remain
in
operation
pending
administrative
and
court
review.
we
conclude
simply
and
only
that
this
case
involved
a
question
other
than
the
one
on
which
we
granted
review.
for
these
reason
we
dismissed
city
news’s
petition
and
leave
the
judgment
of
the
wisconsin
court
of
appeals
undisturbed.
our
decision
in
unanimous.
