justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
can
be
done
by
the
court.
if
that's
constitutionally
required,
as
you
say,
when
you
have
the
ordinance
providing
for
prompt
commencement
of
judicial
review,
what
would
go
along
with
the
prompt
commencement
of
judicial
review
is
the
ability
of
the
court,
indeed
the
obligation
of
the
court,
if
the
constitution
is
as
you
say
it
is,
to
immediately
issue
a
stay
order
preventing
the
cancellation
of
the
license.
why
isn't
that
sufficient?
why
does
it
have
to
be
in
the
statute
if
you
provide
for
judicial
review
and
if,
as
you
tell
us,
the
court
having
judicial
review
must
maintain
the
status
quo?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
if
it's
constitutionally
required,
as
you
tell
us.
you
tell
us
that
the
status
quo
has
to
be
maintained.
if
that's
so,
you
have
a...
you
know,
a
lock
on
a
stay
order
from
the
court
as
soon
as
the
case
gets
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
also
mean
that
you've
brought
this
case
before
you
have
any
reason
to
believe
you've
been
harmed.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
why
should
we
pronounce
that
advisory
opinion?
if
it
is
indeed
the
case,
as
you
say
it
is,
that
the
court
must
issue
a
stay
order,
why
can't
we
await
that
event?
if
and
when
a
court
doesn't
issue
a
stay
order,
then
you've
been
harmed.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
disability
has
nothing...
i
mean,
that
disability
has
something
to
do
with
a
defect
in
the
system
that
might
have
produced
a
merits
decision
that
was
contrary
to
the
facts,
or
contrary
to
the
law,
but
i
don't
see
how
that
disability
has
anything
to
do
with
the
question
of
timing
that
you're
now
bringing
before
us.
i
mean,
if,
indeed,
your
client
was
properly
found
to
be
in
violation
of
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
ordinance,
then
it
seems
to
me
he
deserves
to
be
disabled
from
future
licensing.
what
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
the
timing
question
of,
you
know,
he
has
to
be
allowed
to
continue
operation
before
the
adjudication
is
made?
i
mean,
i
see
that
you
have
some
continuing
interest,
but
it's
not
an
interest
that
depends
at
all
upon
the
issue
that
you're
bringing
before
us
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
not
saying
that
the
whole
judicial
review
mechanism
is
invalid
in
the
sense
that
it
has
produced
an
unjust
or
incorrect
substantive
decision.
you're
saying
that
there's
one
feature
of
it,
namely
whether
your
client
was
allowed
to
operate
in
the
meantime
that
rendered
it
unfair,
but
i
don't
see
how
that
has
anything
to
do
with
your...
the
propriety
of
preventing
your
client
from
operating
in
the
future,
once
a
substantive
violation
has
properly
been
found.
or,
you
say
it
can't
properly
be
found,
that
the
entire
judicial
proceeding
is
invalidated
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
your
client
could
not
be
allowed
to
continue
operation
pending
the
proceeding?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
meitz,
would
you
be
making
this
same
argument
if
what
was
at
issue
here
was
not
a
statute
directed
at
adult
book
stores
but
a
statute
directed
at,
let's
say,
radio
stations?
it's
not
addressed
at
all
business,
just
radio
stations.
it
picks
them
out,
and
it
addresses
the
external
effects
of
radio
stations.
if
they're
found
to
be
in
violation
of
the
sanitary
code
because
they're
infested
with
rats,
or
because
the
plumbing
is
unsafe,
or
because
the
electricity
is
unsafe,
their
license
can
be
revoked.
it
seems
to
me
a
very
parallel
situation.
now,
would
you
say
that
you
could
have
a
hearing
under
that
statute
directed
only
at
radio
stations,
and
shut
down
the
radio
station
before
the
opportunity
for
complete
judicial
review
has
been
accorded?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
worried--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
these
adult
book
store
owners
keep
going
out
of
business
and
not
intending
to
get
back
in?
i
mean,
we
had
the
same
question
in
pap's.
it's
an
occupational
hazard,
i
gather.
[laughter]
i
don't
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
until
it
gets
to
the
court?
are
you
saying
that
if
it's
a
content
based
restriction
you
cannot
impose
it
until
the
judicial
review
is
complete?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
a
stay
by
the
judge,
if
the
judge
thought
there
was
any
question
about
it,
why
wouldn't
that
have
sufficed
in
that
context
as
well?
