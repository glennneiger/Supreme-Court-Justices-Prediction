mr.
waldman,
is
your
client
still
incarcerated?
does
this
case
affect
his
actual
incarceration?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
dreeben,
why
didn't
the
government
tell
us
this
in
the
response
to
the
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
those
grounds
would
be
hard
for
us,
really,
to
address
here
for
the
first
time,
at
least
on
the
grouping
question.
there's
a
five
to
five
split
below,
and
the
sentencing
commission
is
considering
a
change,
particularly
hard
for
us
to
deal
with.
