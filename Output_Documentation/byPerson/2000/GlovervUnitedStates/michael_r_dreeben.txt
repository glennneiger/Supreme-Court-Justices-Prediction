mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
agree
with
petitioner
that
the
seventh
circuit
erred
in
adopting
a
significant
difference
test
for
measuring
the
prejudice
inquiry
under
strickland
v.
washington.
we
believe,
however,
that
the
judgment
in
this
case
is
correct,
because
petitioner's
counsel
at
trial
and
direct
appeal
neither
rendered
deficient
performance
nor
gave
rise
to
prejudice.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
o'connor,
at
the
stage
when
we
responded
to
the
petition,
we
told
the
court
that
we
thought
the
judgment
was
correct.
we
did
not
defend
the
rationale
of
the
seventh
circuit
and,
in
fact,
indicated
that
the
seventh
circuit
might
wish
to
reconsider
it
in
light
of
this
court's
intervening
decision
in
williams
v.
taylor
and
a
fifth
circuit
decision
that
had
criticized
it,
but
we
had
not
formally
concluded
our
analysis
of
whether
at
the
end
of
the
day
we
would
or
would
not
defend
the
approach
that
the
seventh
circuit
adopted
at
the
time
we
filed
our
response
to
the
certiorari
position.
after
we
told
the
court
not
to
grant
the
case,
and
the
court
disagreed
and
granted
it,
we
then
undertook
a
complete
analytical
review
of
the
seventh
circuit's
approach
and
concluded
that
we
could
not
submit
that
this
court
could
affirm
that
approach
consistent
with
its
own
cases
and
principles
governing
the
ineffective
assistance
analysis,
but
we
continued
to
believe
that
the
judgment
in
this
case
as
rendered
by
the
seventh
circuit
was
correct
on
alternative
bases.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
agree,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
sentencing
guidelines
question
and
the
intricacies
related
to
whether
money
laundering
should
be
grouped
with
the
underlying
offense
are
both
complicated
and
the
kind
of
issue
that
this
court
would
ordinarily
properly
leave
to
the
sentencing
commission
to
resolve,
particularly
since
the
sentencing
commission
is
aware
of
it.
we
presented
that
analysis
on
the
prejudice
prong
of
the
case
in
order
to
illustrate
how
very
complicated
the
guidelines
decisions
that
counsel
faces
are
when
deciding
whether
to
raise
a
particular
claim
or
not
to
raise
a
particular
claim.
these
are
intricate
matters
that
are
quite
complex
in
federal
criminal
law,
and
more
complex
than
most
decisions
that
counsel
has
to
make,
and
it
is
therefore
highly
relevant
to
what
this
court
says,
if
anything,
about
the
proper
analysis
and
performance
when
counsel
is
charged
with
having
failed
to
raise
a
sentencing
guidelines
claim
that
the
client
later
believes
that
he
should
have
raised.
the
seventh
circuit--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
fundamental
point
that
the
seventh
circuit
was
trying
to
make
in
adopting
its
significant
difference
test
was
that
there
are
a
multitude
of
guidelines
questions
that
confront
counsel
who
is
handling
a
sentence
or
a
sentencing
guidelines
question
on
appeal,
and
that
if
it
were
the
case
that
any
guidelines
error
could
support
collateral
relief,
the
defendant
would
often
get
the
chance
for
two
full
bites
at
the
apple
at
sentencing
questions,
first
at
trial
and
on
direct
appeal,
and
second
on
collateral
review,
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
quite
agree,
justice
breyer,
and
my
point
is
that
the
considerations
that
drove
the
seventh
circuit
to
adopt
its
rule
on
prejudice
are
actually
far
more
pertinent
to
analyzing
the
performance
prong.
sentencing
guidelines
claims,
as
the
court
knows,
are
not
only
complex
but
can
have
unpredictable
outcomes,
and
can--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
the
reason
why
it
is
relevant
for
the
court
to
say
something
about
the
performance
issue,
which
was
not
addressed
squarely
by
the
seventh
circuit...
we
did
argue
it
in
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
didn't
address
it
either,
so
it
has
not
been
resolved
by
the
courts
below,
but
it
is
highly
interrelated
with
the
prejudice
inquiry
in
a
sentencing
guidelines
ineffective
assistance
collateral
attack,
and
the
point
that
the
seventh
circuit
was
trying
to
make
was
to
give
courts
a
way
to
weed
out
these
collateral
attacks
in
an
efficient
way.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
agree
that
the
seventh
circuit
hasn't
resolved
it,
but
this
court
is
going
to
announce
a
decision
that
will
be
influential
in
the
way
that
the
lower
courts
address
comparable
sentencing
guidelines
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
cases,
and
i
think
that
it
would
be
useful
for
the
lower
courts
to
have
some
guidance
from
this
court
as
to
some
of
the
relevant
considerations
and
factors
that
ought
to
be
brought
to
bear
on
the
performance
inquiry.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
hope
they're
not
bizarre,
but
i
do
think
that
the
arguments
that
we've
made
have
gone
a
little
bit
beyond
what
you,
justice
scalia,
have
just
accurately
described
as
where
this
court
has
thus
far
gone
in
analyzing
the
performance
inquiry.
clearly,
counsel
has
to
be
selective
in
raising
the
issues
that
it
chooses
to
present
to
an
appellate
court
especially,
and
clearly,
as
this
court
stated
in
smith
v.
robbins
last
term,
just
because
a
claim
might
look
good
in
hindsight
doesn't
mean
that
it's
the
kind
of
claim
that
counsel
should
be
deemed
obligated
to
have
raised.
but
there
is
a
unique
feature
to
the
sentencing
guidelines
claims,
as
well
as
a
generally
relevant
point
to
appellate
advocacy
that
i
think
the
court
could
do
well
to
clarify.
in
these
sentencing
guidelines
claims,
there
can
often
be
ambiguity
about
whether
a
particular
claim
will
indeed
help
the
defendant
when
it
is
raised
on
appeal
and
prevails
and,
if
so,
by
how
much.
in
this
case,
most
starkly,
our
view
is
that
if
petitioner
got
the
grouping
that
he
asked
for,
his
offense
level
should
actually
go
up,
not
down,
because
the
grouping
would
have
required
that
all
of
the
financial
harm
that
he
inflicted
on
the
various
victims
be
aggregated
into
one
group,
so
a
counsel
who
was
looking
at
a
sentencing
guidelines
claim,
unlike
claims
that
would
simply
result
in
a
reversal
of
a
conviction,
has
to
be
cognizant
that
there
can
be
unintended
adverse
effects.
in
addition,
and
this
was
the
insight
that
i
think
the
seventh
circuit
was
most
concerned
with,
sentencing
guidelines
claims
can
produce
sometimes
only
very
modest
benefits,
and
the
length
of
the
benefit
that
would
be
produced
is
a
relevant
factor
in
considering
whether
reasonable
counsel
would
elect
to
raise
a
relatively
long
shot
claim,
or
a
claim
that's
not
established.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
[laughter]
i'm
here
seeking
to
affirm
the
judgment,
and
if
i
can't
affirm
the
judgment,
at
least
get
some
guidance
that
would
be
useful
to
the
lower
courts
that
have
been
grappling
with
this
problem.
now,
petitioner
has,
of
course,
pointed
out
that
it
is
unusual
for
the
court
to
go
beyond
the
scope
of
the
question
presented
and
address
grounds
that
were
not
decided
below
and
the
government,
of
course,
fully
agrees
with
that.
we
recognize
that
it's
unusual.
it's
certainly
not
unprecedented
for
the
court
to
decide
a
case
on
grounds
that
weren't
decided
by
the
lower
court
or
that
were
not
fully
addressed.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
would
call
it
giving
guidance,
mr.
justice
stevens.
[laughter]
the
court
similarly
believed
that
it
was
appropriate
to
give
guidance
to
the
lower
courts
by
showing
how
the
rule
of
law
applies
to
the
particular
facts
in
brook
group
v.
brown
&
williamson,
a
1993
decision
where
the
court
took
a
novel
antitrust
principle
and
then
applied
it
to
the
very
intricate
and
specific
facts
of
that
case.
in
siegert
v.
gilley,
a
1991
decision,
the
court
actually
affirmed
the
judgment
on
a
ground
that
the
lower
court
had
not
reached
at
all.
there,
the
lower
court
had
said
there
was
a
heightened
pleading
requirement
for
qualified
immunity.
this
court
decided
the
case
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
no
underlying
constitutional
right
that
was
asserted
in
the
bivens
action
at
all,
and
in
that
case
not
only
was
that
not
the
question
presented,
but
the
parties
hadn't
even
briefed
it
or
addressed
it.
so--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
do
have
a
hard
time
saying
it's
logically
antecedent,
but
the
third
case
that
i
would
refer
the
court
to
involves
the
elaboration
of
the
additional
implications
of
a
claim
that
the
court
decided.
that
is
colstad
v.
american
dental
association,
which
was
decided
in
1999,
and
there
the
court
elaborated
a
standard
for
punitive
damages
in
title
vii
actions
and
then
went
on
to
give
guidance
to
the
lower
courts
about
how
agency
principles
apply,
but
then
remanded--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
am
relying
on
the
majority's
disposition
in
the
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
seventh
circuit
obviously
could
resolve
these
issues,
and
if
this
court
chooses
to
give
the
guidance
that
we
think
is
appropriate,
it
will
help
the
overall
administration
of
the
judicial
system,
because
we
believe,
on
the
one
hand,
that
when
a
defendant
has
not
had
adequate
assistance
of
counsel,
constitutionally
effective
assistance
of
counsel
in
litigating
the
sentencing
guidelines
claims,
and
he
can
show
a
reasonable
probability
of
a
different
outcome,
then
he
has
satisfied
the
elements
of
a
constitutional
claim.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
the
court
could--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
perhaps
why
the
sentencing
commission
is
going
to
clarify
this.
i
think
it's
also
perhaps
why
counsel
should
not
be
quickly
branded
ineffective.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
i
actually
would
like
the
court
to
say
that
the
seventh
circuit
applied
the
incorrect
test
for
prejudice,
but
a
properly
analyzed
performance
and
prejudice
inquiry
would
produce
the
conclusion
that
petitioner's
counsel
is
wrong.
that
would
be
my
first
choice.
my
second
choice
is
for
the
court
to
do
no
harm
to
the
arguments
that
i'm
making
about
ineffective
assistance,
and
that
those
are
really
the
only
two
choices
that
i'd
like
to
submit
to
the
court
at
present.
[laughter]
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
a
constitutional
floor
that
applies
regardless
of
whether
counsel
is
retained
or
appointed.
the
only
place
where
there's
a
different
standard
is
where
counsel
is
waived
altogether
and
the
defendant
represents
himself.
he
can
then
not
charge
himself
with
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
there
is
one
legal
point
that
has
not
been
clarified
in
this
court's
cases
regarding
appellate
assistance
by
counsel
that
could
also
be
usefully
clarified,
and
that
is
that
we
think
the
proper
inquiry
would
look
to
the
state
of
the
law
facing
appellate
counsel,
rather
than
having
an
evidentiary
hearing
that
would
analyze
in
great
depth
how
much
legal
research
the
particular
counsel
did
in
anticipation
of
filing
his
appellate
brief.
the
inquiries
here
are
essentially
whether
the
defendant's
lawyer
did
not
present
a
claim
that
was
sufficiently
strong
that
it
was
ineffective
for
him
not
to
present
it.
we
think
that
that
is
an
objective
inquiry
that
should
be
measured
by
the
state
of
the
law
that
was
confronting
the
appellate
counsel
at
the
time,
and
should
be
resolved
based
on
the
legal
precedents
that
are
in
existence.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
the
answer
is
no,
for
several
reasons,
justice
ginsburg.
first
of
all
there's
no
authority
that
i
know
of
that
says
that
competent
counsel
is
required
to
continue
to
survey
the
developing
law
on
issues
that
he
decided
not
to
raise
to
appeal
to
an
appellate
court
to
determine
whether
there
has
been
some
change
of
law
on
an
issue
that
he
abandoned.
i
don't
think
that
competent
counsel
is
required
to
stay
abreast
of
the
law
in
that
fashion.
second,
as
we
have
pointed
out,
competent
counsel
may
well
conclude
that,
rather
than
risking
the
ire
of
the
court
of
appeals
by
raising
a
claim
that
he
had
previously
abandoned
and
is
now
exploiting
only
because
some
other
defendant
had
successfully
raised
it
might
cost
him
credibility
with
the
court
of
appeals
and
is
therefore
not
appropriately
done.
there
was
no
authority
in
the
seventh
circuit
at
the
time,
as
there
is
today,
that
says
that
counsel
has
a
right
to
present
new
issues
that
are
based
on
intervening
law.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
have
spoken
to
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
about
that
question
and
i
have
not
received
a
clear
answer,
because
it
doesn't
come
up
all
that
often,
but
i
will
say
that
the
seventh
circuit
is
a
procedurally
strict
circuit
and
it
does
make
every
effort
to
ensure
that
parties
get
review
only
on
those
issues
that
they've
elected
to
raise
in
their
opening
brief.
now,
there
is
one
piece
of
stray
dictum
in
a
seventh
circuit
case
that
suggests
that,
of
course,
if
the
law
changes,
maybe
parties
can
raise
new
issues.
other
circuits
are
divided
on
that
issue,
so
it's
hardly
something
that
i
think
competent
counsel
should
be
presumed
required
to
do
in
order
to
meet
the
minimal
constitutional
standard
of
adequacy.
and
the
final
reason
why
in
this
case
i
don't
think
competent
counsel
was
deficient
even
if
he
knew
about
wilson
and
didn't
raise
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
is
because
wilson,
under
its
grouping
analysis,
produces
this
strange
anomaly
of
requiring
more
financial
harm
to
be
included
in
each
of
the
offenses
that
is
grouped,
and
for
reasons
that
as
justice
breyer
has
pointed
out,
very
few
people
understand
but
we've
attempted
to
lay
out
in
our
brief,
the
offense
level
would
actually
go
up,
and
it
would
have
a
counterintuitive
result.
this
actually
happened
in
the
wilson
case.
the
judge
on
remand
from
wilson
i,
the
case
that
petitioner
says
should
have
been
cited
to
the
panel,
resentenced
the
defendant
to
a
higher
sentence,
faithfully
applying
the
guidelines
as
he
understood
them.
the
court
of
appeals
then
reversed,
saying,
well,
the
government
had
waived
its
right
to
argue
the
increased
offense
level
in
that
manner.
we
don't
agree
with
the
seventh
circuit's
waiver
analysis,
but
the
more
salient
point
here
is
that
no
counsel
could
have
foreseen
that
the
seventh
circuit
would
later
apply
a
waiver
analysis,
and
thus,
if
counsel
had
actually
read
the
seventh
circuit's
decision
and
said
grouping
is
required
under
subsection
(d)
of
the
sentencing
guidelines,
section
3(d)1.2,
and
had
asked
for
that,
the
sentence
could
go
up,
and
that
lawyer
would
not
be
assured
that
there
would
be
any
purpose
served
by
raising
that
kind
of
an
argument
only
to
his
client's
ultimate
detriment.
so
taking
into
account
the
complexities
of
the
guidelines,
the
potential
for
adverse
results
that
can
occur,
and
the
state
of
the
law
which
hardly
suggested
that
this
was,
as
judge
easterbrook
has
called
in
another
context,
a
dead
bang
winner
on
appeal,
we
don't
think
that
there
was
any
deficient
performance
by
petitioner's
counsel
that
would
merit
ineffective
assistance
relief
on
collateral
review.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
