mr.
michael
l.
waldman
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
the
district
court
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
an
additional
6
to
21
months
in
prison
caused
by
counsel's
deficient
performance
was
not
sufficiently
significant
to
satisfy
the
prejudice
prong
of
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
standard.
we
believe
the
lower
court's
attempt
to
transform
this
court's
prejudice
analysis
under
strickland
into
a
requirement
that
defendant
show
a
significant
increase
in
their
term
of
imprisonment
is
misplaced.
this
court
should
reject
a
significant
prejudice
test
as
inconsistent
with
strickland
and
this
court's
prior
treatment
of
the
prejudice
test,
as
inconsistent
with
this
court's
prior
holding
in
argesinger
v.
hamlin
that
the
right
to
counsel
applies
where
any
term
of
imprisonment
is
imposed,
and
because
a
significant
prejudice
test
is
unworkable
and
unfair.
also
in
this
case,
as
mr.
chief
justice
has
noted,
the
government
agrees
with
glover
on
the
basic
issue
that
the
seventh
circuit's
significant
prejudice
test
is
incorrect.
the
government,
however,
raises
a
host
of
alternative
grounds
for
affirmance
in
its
brief
on
the
merits.
because
these
new
government
arguments
were
not
raised
by
the
government
in
the
court
of
appeals,
not
addressed
by
any
lower
court,
not
encompassed
within
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
and
not
persuasive
even
when
examined
on
their
own
merits,
this
court
should
not
reach
these
new
arguments,
but
should
leave
them
to
the
lower
courts
to
be
addressed
on
remand.
mr.
michael
l.
waldman
your
honor,
i
think
the
issues
as
to
what
arguments
have
been
waived,
what
arguments...
by
the
government
or
by
mr.
glover,
whether
to
do
a
recalculation
is
something
that
would
have
to
be
sorted
out
by
the
seventh
circuit,
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
very
reasons
why
remand
to
the
lower
court
is
appropriate
in
this
case.
in
strickland
v.
washington,
this
court
established
the
prejudice
prong
for
demonstrating
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
it
stated
that
a
defendant
must
show
that
but
for
counsel's
unprofessional
errors
the
results
of
the
proceeding
would
have
been
different.
in
numerous
decisions
since
strickland,
this
court
has
quoted
and
adhered
to
this
difference
in
result
language
from
strickland.
the
court
of
appeals
erroneously
derived
the
significant
prejudice
test
by
misreading
this
court's
decision
in
lockhart
v.
fretwell.
the
circuit
court
misinterpreted
lockhart
v.
fretwell
as
modifying
the
normal
strickland
test
by
purportedly
adding
a
new,
more
rigorous
prejudice
requirement.
last
term,
in
williams
v.
taylor,
this
court
rejected
the
proposition
that
lockhart
has
announced
a
new
higher
standard
for
showing
prejudice.
this
court
in
williams
reiterated
that
strickland's
difference-in-result
test
remained
the
standard
to
be
applied
in
virtually
all
cases.
williams
emphasized
that,
in
its
own
words,
a
mere
difference
in
outcome
was
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
prejudice
prong.
here,
mr.
glover's
counsel's
ineffective
performance
led
mr.
glover
to
receive
an
additional
6
to
21
months
in
prison,
clearly
a
difference
in
outcome.
we
also
believe
that
this
court
should
be
guided
by
its
decision
in
argesinger
v.
hamlin.
there,
the
court
held
that
any
term
of
imprisonment,
no
matter
how
short,
implicates
the
constitutional
right
to
counsel.
consistent
with
argesinger
and
its
progeny,
this
court
should
not
tolerate
6
to
21
months
of
undeserved
imprisonment
caused
by
the
ineffective
performance
of
counsel.
furthermore,
as
the
government
itself
notes
in
its
brief,
a
significant
prejudice
test
is
unworkable.
one
sees
this
problem
in
the
decision
of
the
district
court
below,
where
the
district
court
struggled
to
figure
out
whether
6
to
21
months
in
prison
was
sufficiently
significant.
although
the
court
of
appeals
has
employed
the
significant
prejudice
test
for
a
number
of
years,
it
remains
unclear
whether
the
significant
increase
in
sentence
refers
to
some
percentage
change,
some
absolute
number
of
months,
or
some
other
factor.
for
example,
if
significance
is
measured
in
offense
levels,
as
some
courts
have
stated,
the
two
offense
levels
such
as
occurred
in
mr.
glover's
case,
a
two-offense-level
change
can
be
as
much
as
8
or
9
additional
years
in
prison
in
some
cases,
depending
on
the
crime
and
the
characteristics
of
the
offense.
mr.
michael
l.
waldman
yes,
your
honor.
he
has
served
approximately
5
years
of
his
term,
but
he
has
another
13
months
remaining,
so
a
favorable
result
on
a
section
2255
motion
would
allow
him
to
be
released.
we
don't
believe
that
one
can
seriously
argue
that
8
or
9
additional
years
imprisonment
which
are
undeserved,
and
caused
only
by
counsel's
errors,
can
ever
be
considered
insignificant.
moreover,
we
would
make
the
more
basic
point,
the
point
which
we
believe
lies
at
the
core
of
argesinger,
of
strickland,
and
the
right
to
counsel
cases,
which
is
that
any
term
of
imprisonment
which
is
undeserved
and
resulted
from
a
lack
of
effective
counsel
cannot
be
permitted
to
stand.
turning
to
the
new
arguments
in
the
government's
brief
on
the
merits,
although
now
agreeing
with
mr.
glover
that
the
lower
courts
erred
in
applying
a
significant
prejudice
test,
the
government
goes
on
on
its
brief
on
the
merits
to
raise
a
variety
of
new
grounds
for
affirmance.
the
government
argues
that
mr.
glover's
counsel
did
not
perform
deficiently
at
all.
the
government
now
argues
that
the
wilson
case
requiring
grouping
offenses
such
as
mr.
glover's,
that
that
case
was
wrongly
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
should
be
overruled
by
this
court.
finally,
the
government
now
argues
that
correctly
recalculated
under
wilson,
in
its
view,
mr.
glover's
sentence
would
actually
be
increased.
however,
these
alternative
grounds
were
not
properly
raised
previously
in
this
case,
and
should
not
be
addressed
by
this
court
in
the
first
instance.
first,
these
various
government
arguments
were
never
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
government
argued
only
one
issue
in
the
court
below,
that
6
to
21
additional
months
in
prison
did
not
satisfy
the
significant
prejudice
test
established
by
the
seventh
circuit,
and
we
attach,
in
our...
as
appendix
a
to
our
reply
brief,
the
government's
brief
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
michael
l.
waldman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
l.
waldman
well,
your
honor,
they
obviously
had
the
right
to
raise
whatever
arguments
they
wanted
to
affirm
the
district
court
below,
alternative
grounds
for
affirmance
at
that
court.
our
position
is
not
that
they
were...
it
was...
they
were
required
to
raise
these
arguments,
but
in
failing
to
raise
them
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
now
raise
them
to
this
court,
that
it's
not
appropriate
for
this
court
under
its
rules
of
procedures
to
address
them
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
michael
l.
waldman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
second,
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
ever
addressed
any
of
these
various
new
government
arguments.
the
lower
courts
relied
on
only
one
ground,
that
petitioner
could
not
satisfy
the
significant
prejudice
test
of
the
seventh
circuit.
third,
these
government
arguments
are
very
different
from
the
issue
that
we
presented
for
review
by
this
court
in
our
petition.
the
question
presented
by
petitioner
focused
exclusively
on
the
validity
of
the
significant
prejudice
test
which
was
relied
on
in
the
decisions
below
to
dismiss
mr.
glover's
petition.
in
these
circumstances,
this
court
should
not
reach
out
to
address
the
alternative
grounds
for
affirmance
now
raised
in
the
government's
brief
on
the
merits.
this
rule's...
this
court's
rules
of
procedure,
as
well
as
the
numerous
cases
that
we
cite
at
pages
7
and
8
of
our
reply
brief,
make
clear
that
the
practice
of
this
court
is
not
to
address
issues
which
appear
for
the
first
time
in
the
merits
brief
to
this
court.
there
are
no
extraordinary
circumstances
here
which
demand
that
this
court
diverge
from
its
usual
practice.
the
government's
arguments
do
not
raise
pressing
issues
of
constitutional
significance,
or
issues
of
great
national
import.
rather,
the
government's
new
arguments
involve
complicated
and
detailed
applications
of
the
sentencing
guidelines
and
lower
court
procedures
and
decisions.
these
are
precisely
the
types
of
issues
which
this
court
should
not
be
addressing.
as
this
court
noted
in
braxton
v.
united
states,
this
court
should
be,
in
its
own
words,
restrained
and
circumspect
in
resolving
sentencing
guidelines
interpretation
issues,
since
congress
expressly
provided
the
sentencing
commission
with
the
power
to
resolve
issues
involving
conflicts
in
interpretation
of
the
sentencing
guidelines.
here
in
particular,
the
sentencing
commission
has
announced
that
as
one
of
its
priorities
this
year
it
will
be
examining
the
guidelines
interpretation
of
section
3(d)1.2,
which
is
the
very
section
which
the
government
is
asking
the
court
to
review.
this
court
will
also
occasionally
resolve
issues
which
were
not
raised
below,
where
there
is
an
obvious
plain
error
which
this
court
can
quickly
and
easily
dispose
of.
that
also
is
not
the
case
here.
as
we
demonstrate
at
pages
12
through
20
of
our
reply
brief,
not
only
are
these
issues
not
easily
resolved,
but
the
government's
new
arguments
at
the
end
of
the
day
are
simply
without
merit.
the
government
argues
that
there
was
no
deficient
performance
by
glover's
counsel,
yet
glover's
counsel
on
appeal
never
raised
the
issue
of
grouping
the
kickback
and
money
laundering
offenses.
the
probation
officer's
report
had
recommended
grouping,
and
at
least
three
circuits
had
ruled
in
favor
of
such
grouping.
this
was
a
pure
legal
issue.
it
was
a
strong
viable
claim
that
his
appellate
counsel
should
have
raised,
and
which,
as
the
wilson
case
shows
us,
would
have
prevailed.
this
grouping
issue
was
far
superior
to
the
two
claims
which
were
raised
by
mr.
glover's
counsel
on
appeal.
these
two
claims
involve
challenges
on
evidentiary
and
fact
findings
by
the
district
judge
where
the
standard
of
review
required
glover's
counsel
to
make
his
case
by
clear
error.
ultimately
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
these
two
claims
raised
by
glover's
counsel
were
wholly
unfounded,
in
its
words,
involved
no
error
whatsoever,
let
alone
clear
error,
and
also
again
in
the
opinion
it
says
it
was
not
a...
these
are
not
a
close
call.
comparing
the
grouping
claim
with
those
claims
which
he
did
assert,
we
submit
that
glover's
appellate
counsel
clearly
acted
outside
the
scope
of
a
reasonably
competent
attorney
in
not
raising
this
grouping
issue
on
appeal.
we
also
believe
that
it
was
clearly
deficient
performance
to
not
bring
the
wilson
case,
a...
the
seventh
circuit's
new
case
which
controlled
this
issue
and
was
directly
on
point,
to
not
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
panel
in
mr.
glover's
case,
even
though
that
case
was
still
pending
when
wilson
was
decided.
as
to
the
government's
other
elaborate
challenges
to
the
sentencing
guidelines
calculation,
we
believe
that
the
seventh
circuit's
decisions
in
wilson
i
and
wilson
ii
are
controlling
and
correct.
the
government
has
offered
no
compelling
justification
for
this
court
to
review
these
decisions,
or
to
overrule
their
sound
reasoning.
mr.
michael
l.
waldman
retained
counsel,
your
honor.
in
summary,
the
government's
various
new
arguments
are
inappropriate
for
this
court
to
address
in
the
first
instance.
they
involve
complicated
fact
specific
and
detailed
issues
which
are
best
sorted
out
by
the
lower
courts.
the
issue
which
this
court
accepted
for
review
was
whether
6
to
21
additional
months
in
prison
due
to
counsel's
ineffective
performance
constitute
prejudice
under
the
strickland
test.
this
court's
precedent
and
elemental
fairness
requires
that
this
court
reject
the
significant
prejudice
test
applied
by
the
court
below.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
l.
waldman
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
will
be
brief.
the
government
has
said
that
it
wants
this
court
to
issue
guidance.
i
wrote
down,
an
advisory
opinion
would
be
useful
to
clarify
some
points.
this
court
has
procedures
as
to
when
it
will
take
cases
in
the
first
instance.
it
says
that
it
will
only
do
so
in
extraordinary,
rare
circumstances.
this
court...
there
are
reasons
for
those
procedures
of
this
court,
and
the
cases
that
we
cite
at
page
7
and
8
of
our
reply
brief.
this
court
benefits
from
the
thinking
of
the
lower
court.
it
benefits
from
the
refinement
and
sharpening
of
issues
by
the
lower
courts.
none
of
that
occurred
here,
and
the
government
has
not
identified
any
issue
that
is
so
pressing,
that
is
so...
such
an
issue
of
concern
for
the
lower
courts
that
guidance
by
this
court
is
essential.
it
hasn't
reached
that
extraordinary
circumstance
requirement
which
this
court
has
set
for
dealing
with
issues
at
the
first
instance.
there
is
nothing
at
core...
as
justice
scalia
said,
this
is
standard
analysis.
there
is
nothing
unusual
about
these
arguments
being
made
by
the
government
here
concerning
the
sentencing
guidelines.
they
are
complicated
arguments.
they
are
detailed
arguments.
they
are
arguments
which
are
best
sorted
out
by
the
lower
courts
here.
as
to
whether
the
seventh
circuit
would
accept
the
wilson
case
if
offered
after
briefing
and
oral
argument,
we
cite
a
number
of
cases
in
footnote
14
indicating
that
we
believe
they
would,
but
that's
an
issue
which
the
seventh
circuit
is
in
the
best
situation
to
resolve,
not
this
court
in
the
first
instance.
we
would
also
note,
again,
this
court's
decision
in
braxton
v.
united
states,
that
it
should
restrained
and
circumspect
in
dealing
with
sentencing
guidelines
issues.
this
sentencing
guideline
issue
in
particular
is
in
front
of
the
sentencing
commission,
and
we
don't
see
any
reason
for
this
court
to
engage
in
advisory
opinions
or
clarifying
issues
that
have
not
been
addressed
and
dealt
with
by
the
lower
courts.
