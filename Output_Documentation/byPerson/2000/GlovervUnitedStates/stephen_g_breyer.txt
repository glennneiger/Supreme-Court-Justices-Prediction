that
may
be,
but
it's
hard
to
say
that's
what
the
seventh
circuit
was
talking
about.
they
say
glover,
to
win
on
ineffective
assistance
he'd
have
to
show
his
counsel
performed
below
a
constitutional
threshold
and
that
the
deficient
performance
prejudiced
him.
even
if
we
were
to
assume
that
glover's
attorneys
performed
inadequately,
the
second
prong,
prejudice,
is
missing
here,
and
then
they
go
on
to
discuss
that,
so
it
seems
to
me
they
didn't
say
one
single
word
about
was,
what
was
or
what
was
not
inadequate
performance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
so
what
you
want
us
to
say
is,
we
assume
for
argument's
sake
that
the
present
defendant's
present
interpretation
of
how
this
all
works,
the
multiple
count
thing
is
correct.
we'd
have
to
say
that,
otherwise
we'd
have
to
get
into
who's
right
and
who's
wrong
about
multiple
counts,
wouldn't
we?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we'd
have
to
say,
we
assume
they're
right,
i
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
do
you
want
us
to
get
into
multiple
counts,
which
is...
i
know
multiple
counts.
it's
like
hagel
on
his
death
bed.
he
said,
only
one
person
has
ever
understood
me,
and
even
he
didn't
understand
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
you
want
us
to
say,
we
assume
for
argument's
sake
that
they're
right
on
the
merits
of
multiple
counts,
a
thing
you
don't
really
believe,
but
you
want
us
to
say
that
they're
right,
for
assumption.
