there's
really
nothing
novel
about
the
points
you
make
concerning
adequacy
of
counsel's
performance.
you
say,
you
know,
these
are
complex
issues,
you
can't
raise
too
many
either
at
the
trial
level
or
especially
on
appeal,
you
have
to
pick
your
good
targets,
this
wasn't
a
good
target...
i
mean,
it's
all
standard
analysis,
it
seems
to
me.
i
could
understand
it
if
you
were
presenting
to
this
court
some
novel
new
theory
of
counsel
inadequacy
that
we
have
to
signal
to
the
lower
courts,
but
there's
really
nothing
bizarre
about
the
arguments
you're
making.
they're
standard
adequacy
of
counsel
arguments,
aren't
they,
and
can't
we
leave
them
to
the
second...
seventh
circuit
to
figure
out?
