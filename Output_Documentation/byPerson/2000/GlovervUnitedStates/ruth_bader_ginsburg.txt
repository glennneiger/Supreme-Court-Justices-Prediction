would
it
also
be
open
to
the
lower
court
on
remand
to
reassess
its
initial
position
on
glover's
leadership
role
if
it
knew
what
it
knows
now
about
the...
that
the
seventh
circuit's
test
is
incorrect?
could
the
sentencing
court
then
say,
but
we
didn't
give
extra
points
for
leadership
last
time
around,
now
we
want
to
reassess
that
and
give
him
the
extra
points?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
all
you're
saying.
you're
not
saying
that
they
were
waived.
you're
saying
that's
a
decision
for
the
seventh
circuit
to
make
on
remand.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
dreeben,
may
i
just
stop
you
there
to
confirm
that
you
recognize
the
second
circuit
did
not
pass
on
the
adequacy
of
the
performance.
it
said,
we
will
assume,
for
purposes
of
this
decision,
that
the
performance
was
inadequate.
even
so,
there
was
no
prejudice.
so
we
don't
even
have
an
answer
in
the
first
instance
on
the
deficiency
of
the
performance
from
the
seventh
circuit.
why
should
we
handle
such
a
question
as
a
matter
of
first
view?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
not
let
the
seventh
circuit
make
it,
because
looking
at
its
current
decision,
all
it
said
is,
we're
going
to
assume
for
purposes
of
this
decision
that
counsel's
performance
was
inadequate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
the
suggestion
here
that
sometime
between
the
oral
argument
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit's
decision
this
intervening
decision
in
wilson
came
down,
so
that
any
competent
counsel
would
have
said
to
the
seventh
circuit,
may
i
file
a
supplement
including
this
decision,
which
bears
very
much
on
a
case
that
is
sub
judica
before
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
know
what
the
seventh
circuit
practice
is?
does
it
generally
receive
such
supplemental
briefs
based
on
intervening
changes
in
the
law?
