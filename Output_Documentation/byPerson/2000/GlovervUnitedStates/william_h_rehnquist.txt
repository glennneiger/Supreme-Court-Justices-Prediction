chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
99-8576,
paul
glover
v.
united
states.
mr.
waldman.
mr.
waldman,
after
reading
the
briefs
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government
has
pretty
well
conceded
the
question
presented
here,
and
is
asking
for
affirmance
on
alternate
grounds.
now,
we
don't
decide
cases
on
the
basis
of
concessions,
but
you
might
be
well
advised
to
save
a
good
deal
of
time
for
rebuttal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
government...
you,
of
course,
were
appealing
against
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
were
you
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so
how
much
is
the
government
expected...
as
an
appellee,
how
many
of
these
things
do
you
expect
it
to
raise,
when
you're
appealing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
glover's
counsel
on
the
first
appeal,
was
it
retained
counsel
or
furnished
by
the
government?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
waldman.
mr.
dreeben,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
would
come
up,
mr.
dreeben,
only
if
we
dealt
on
the
merits
with
your
effort
to
affirm
on
an
alternate
ground.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
dreeben,
i
take
it
we
have
three
choices
here.
we
could
say
something
on
this
issue
that
helps
the
government.
we
could
say
nothing.
we
could
say
something
that
hurts
the
government.
you
would
rather
us
have
us
say
nothing
than
say
something
that
hurts
the
government,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
difference
in
the
legal
standard
applied
to
a
performance
by
retained
counsel
as
opposed
to
appointed
counsel
for
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
purposes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
waldman,
you
have
16
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
waldman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-8576
glover
against
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
