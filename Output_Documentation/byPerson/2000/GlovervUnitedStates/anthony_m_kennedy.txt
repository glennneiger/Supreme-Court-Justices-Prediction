justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
an
unlawful
increase
in
a
federal
prison
sentence
and
the
increase
was
somewhere
between
06
to
21
months
can
be
non
prejudicial
when
the
prisoner
claims
the
illegal
sentence,
the
improper
increase
resulted
from
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
after
a
petitioner
glover’s
conviction
the
pre
sentence
investigation
report
recommended
that
his
convictions
for
labor
racketeering,
money
laundering,
and
tax
evasions
be
grouped
together
under
one
of
the
sentencing
guidelines.
the
government
objected
to
grouping
those
counts.
in
trial
court
glover’s
attorneys
did
not
submit
papers
or
offer
extensive
oral
arguments
contesting
this
no
grouping
position
on
the
part
of
the
government.
when
the
district
court
decided
not
to
group
the
money
laundering
counts,
glover’s
offense
level
was
increased
by
two
levels
that
yield
a
concomitant
increase
in
the
sentencing
range.
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
glover’s
attorneys
did
not
raise
the
grouping
issue.
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
his
conviction
and
the
sentence.
then
glover
filed
a
pro
se
2255
motion.
he
argued
that
the
failure
of
his
counsel
to
press
the
grouping
issue
was
ineffected
the
assistance
of
counsel
at
the
sentencing
proceeding.
under
glover’s
theory
of
the
case
is
84
months
sentence
for
somewhere,
as
i
have
indicated
between
06
and
21
months
more
than
authorized
by
law
because
of
the
trial
court’s
alleged
error
in
not
grouping
the
offenses.
the
district
court
denied
glover’s
2255
motion.
it
determined
that
under
the
seventh
circuit
precedent
an
increase
of
06
to
21
months
was
not
significant
enough
to
prejudice
for
purposes
of
strickland
versus
washington.
as
a
result
the
district
court
did
not
decide
whether
glover’s
attorneys
fell
below
a
reasonable
standard
of
confidence.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
it
relied
on
the
same
no
prejudice
theory.
we
granted
certiorari.
the
government
now
acknowledges
that
the
seventh
circuit’s
rule
is
inconsistent
with
this
court’s
cases
and
unworkable.
it
appears
that
the
seventh
circuit
drew
the
substance
of
its
no
prejudice
rule
from
our
decision
in
lockhart
versus
fretwell.
that
case
held
that
in
some
circumstances
a
mere
difference
in
outcome
will
not
suffice
to
establish
prejudice.
but
we
explained
last
time
that
our
holding
on
lockhart
does
not
supplant
the
strickland
analysis.
the
seventh
circuit
was
incorrect
to
rely
on
lockhart
to
deny
relief
to
persons
alleging
deficient
performance
by
counsel,
because
the
alleged
unlawful
increase
in
sentence
does
not
meet
some
baseline
standard
of
prejudice.
our
jurisprudence
suggests
that
any
amount
of
actual
jail
time
has
sixth
amendment
significance.
now,
the
seventh
circuit’s
rule
is
not
well
considered
in
any
event
because
there
is
no
obvious
dividing
line
by
which
the
measure
how
much
longer
a
sentence
must
be
to
constitute
substantial
prejudice.
we
express
no
opinion
on
the
ultimate
merits
of
glover’s
claim
because
the
question
on
deficient
performance
is
not
a
force,
we
also
express
no
opinion
on
the
alternative
grounds
of
performance
advanced
by
the
government
which
were
neither
raised
in
nor
passed
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
judgment
of
the
seventh
circuit
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
