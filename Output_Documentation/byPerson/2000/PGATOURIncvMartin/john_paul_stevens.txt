justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
would
be
subject
to
suit--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--under
title
1.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
farr,
can
i
just
identify
your
theory
a
little
better?
are
you
contending
that
when
the
golf
course
is
being
used
for
a
pga
tournament,
it
is
not
a
place
of
public
accommodation
because
of
the
limited
number
of
people
that
can
play
on
that
day
or
are
you
contending
that
even
though
it's
a
place
of
public
accommodation,
the
contestants
are
not
individuals
within
the
meaning
of
the
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
are
assuming
that
the
golf
course,
even
though
for
a
specific
purpose,
continues
to
be
a
place
of
public
accommodation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
i
think
you
conceivably
could
have
taken
the
position
that
when
it's
rented
out
for
a
particular
purpose
it
loses
its
character
as
a
place
of
public
accommodation
because
only
certain
people
can
use
it.
you
rent
a
hotel,
say,
to
have
a
wedding.
is
it
then
still
a
place
of
public
accommodation?
but
you
are
not
questioning
that
it
is
a
place
of
public
accommodation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
farr,
that's
not
true
as
to
qualifying
schools.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
thing
that
puzzles
me
is
how
it
can
be
a
fundamental
rule
that
applies
that
does
not
apply
in
the
qualifying
events.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
if
logistics
are
sufficient
to
justify
use
of
a
cart,
why
isn't
this
handicap
sufficient?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
they
are
both
trying
to
determine
the
quality
of
the
golfer
and
it's
not
fundamental
in
qualifying
schools
but
it
is
fundamental
in
the
tour
event
itself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you're
only
saying
walking
is
fundamental
if
there
is
a
rule
against
riding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
only
saying
walking
is
fundamental
if
there
is
and
always
has
been
a
rule
against
riding
in
a
cart.
justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
we
get
into
a
lot
of
unexpected
areas
around
here.
but,
mr.
reardon,
at
the
least,
don't
we
have
to
give
substantial
deference
to
the
sporting
authority?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
reardon,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
theory
about
fundamentally
alter
the
nature
of
the
game.
are
you
contending
that
the
walking
rule
is
never
a
fundamental...
abandoning
the
walking
rule,
it
would
never
be
a
fundamental
rule,
or
are
you
contending
that
with
respect
to
casey
martin,
it's
not
fundamental
because
his
disability
has
the
same
impact
on
his
ability
to
play
as
walking
has
on
other
people?
which
is
your
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
quite
different.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
dissent
again.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
saw
his--
--but
i
just
want
to
be
on
the
record
that
we're
aware
of
that
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then
you're
not
contending
that
the,
if
it,
if
it
weren't
for
the
particular
nature
of
his
disability,
that
it
would
fundamentally
alter
the
game?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
seems
to
me
you
can
have
a
different
rule
for
qualifying
and
then
have,
than
you
have
for
the
final
events.
and
if
the
final
events
are
all
run
consistently
with
the
general
rule,
i'm
not
sure
the,
the
fact
that
it
isn't
fundamental
in
the
sense
you
don't
really
have
to
have
it
makes
the
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
miss
underwood,
may
i
just
ask
a
question
right
there?
putting
the
qualifying
schools
to
one
side
for
a
moment,
at
the
time
they
have
entries
to
the
golf
tournament
itself,
the
public
can't
just...
anybody
just
can't
come
in
and
say
i
want
to
play,
only
those
people
who
have
graduated
from
the
qualifying
school.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
raises
two
questions
concerning
the
application
of
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
of
1990,
to
a
gifted
athlete:
first,
whether
the
act
protects
access
to
professional
golf
tournaments
by
a
qualified
entrant
with
a
disability;
and
second,
whether
a
disabled
contestant
maybe
denied
the
use
of
a
golf
cart
because
it
would
“fundamentally
alter
the
nature”
of
the
tournaments
to
allow
him
to
ride
when
all
other
contestants
must
walk?
petitioner

sponsors
professional
golf
tournaments
conducted
on
three
annual
tours,
the
pga

the
nike

and
the
senior

a
player
may
gain
entry
into
the
pga

or

by
successfully
competing
in
a
three-stage

three
sets
of
rules

the

that
the

second,
the
so-called
“hard
cards”
which
apply
only
to
petitioner’s
tours,
those
cards
require
players
to
walk
during
most
tournaments
that
allow

stages

respondent
casey
martin
is
a
talented
golfer,
he
is
also
an
individual
of
the
disability
under
the
americans
with
disabilities
act.
from
birth
he
has
been
afflicted
with
a
degenerative
circulatory
disorder
that
causes
severe
pain,
and
atrophying
in
his
right
leg.
that
puts
the
leg
at
a
risk
of
hemorrhaging,
fracturing
and
possible
amputation,
and
that
as
the
district
court
found
prevents
him
from
walking
an
18-hole
round
of
golf.
under
the
pga
rules,
he
was
allowed
to
use
a
golf
cart
during
the
first
two
rounds
of
the
q-school
but
not
during
the
third
stage.
he
made
a
request
supported
by
detailed
medical
records
for
permission
to
use
a
cart
but
the
pga
refused
to
review
those
records
or
to
waive
its
walking
rule.
martin
therefore
filed
this
action
under
title
iii
of
the
disabilities
act.
the
district
court
granted
martin
a
preliminary
injunction
requiring
the
pga
to
permit
him
to
use
a
cart
in
its
tournaments,
and
after
a
bench
trial
the
district
court
entered
a
permanent
injunction
to
the
same
effect.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
holding
the
title
iii
applies
to
the
pga
and
that
allowing
martin
to
use
it
cart
would
not
fundamentally
alter
the
nature
of
the
competition
and
its
tournaments.
that
decision
conflicted
with
a
seventh
circuit
case
so
we
granted
certiorari.
we
first
hold
that
the
pga
does
operate
a
place
of
public
accommodation,
the
statute
defines
public
accommodation
in
terms
of
12
broad
categories
and
specifically
list
a
golf
course
is
one
such
place.
those
courses
are
not
only
open
to
the
members
of
the
general
public
who
play
outside
of
the
pga
tournaments,
but
they
are
also
places
they
are
open
to
the
members
of
the
public
who
either
pay
to
watch
those
tournaments,
or
pay
to
enter
the
q-school
or
open
qualifying
rounds
in
order
to
obtain
access
to
pga’s
tournaments.
those
competitors
represent
one
group
of
clients
or
customers
of
the
pga
who
compete
for
price
money
in
its
tournaments.
under
the
statute
the
pga
may
not
deny
those
competitors
including
martin
access
to
tournaments
on
the
basis
of
a
disability
covered
by
the
act.
the
statute
does
provide
however
that
an
entity
does
not
have
to
modify
its
rules
to
grant
access
to
a
disabled
person
if
the
entity
can
demonstrate
that
the
modification
would
fundamentally
alter
the
nature
of
the
activity.
the
critical
question
in
this
case
is
whether
would
fundamentally
alter
either
the
game
of
golf
in
general,
or
the
competition
in
athlete
tournaments
that
the
pga
sponsors
to
waive
the
walking
rule
for
martin
and
to
allow
him
to
use
a
cart.
the
first
part
of
the
question
is
easy,
carts
are
now
a
common
feature
of
the
game
their
use
does
not
affect
the
player
is
handicap
and
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
fundamental
character
of
golf,
the
essence
of
which
has
always
been
shotmaking.
the
more
difficult
question
is
whether
the
walking
rule
is
an
indispensable
feature
of
tournament
golf
at
its
highest
level.
the
pga
contains
that
any
waiver
of
an
outcome
affecting
rule
would
fundamentally
alter
the
character
of
its
tournaments.
the
pga
relies
on
both
common
sense
and
the
testimony
of
experts
to
support
the
proposition
that
the
walking
rule
maybe
“outcome
affecting,”
because
fatigue
may
adversely
affect
performance
and
a
shot
or
two
can
determine
the
outcome
of
the
tournaments.
in
response,
martin
relies
on
two
findings
made
by
the
district
court:
first
for
a
variety
of
reasons
affect
the
fatigue
from
walking
during
the
pga
tournaments
is
generally
not
significant.
indeed
many
professionals
prefer
to
walk.
second,
and
of
greater
importance
is
a
district
courts
uncontested
finding
that
martin
endorse
greater
fatigue
with
a
cart
than
his
able-bodied
competitors
do
by
walking.
since
the
sole
purpose
of
the
walking
rule
is
to
make
fatigue
a
factor
in
the
competition,
and
since
martin
incurs
greater
fatigue
than
his
competitors
even
if
he
has
allowed
to
use
a
cart.
granting
him
a
waiver
of
the
rule
would
not
impair
the
purpose
of
the
rule,
it
therefore
cannot
be
said
to
fundamentally
alter
the
character
of
the
tournaments,
because
such
a
waiver
is
necessary
to
unable
him
to
have
access
to
pga
tournaments
which
as
we
have
held
our
places
of
public
accommodation,
it
is
a
reasonable
modification
that
the
statute
requires.
the
waiver
will
not
give
martin
an
advantage
over
other
competitors,
but
it
will
give
him
access
to
the
privilege
of
qualifying
for
and
competing
in
the
athletic
events
the
pga
offers
to
those
members
of
the
public
who
have
the
skill
and
the
desire
to
enter.
that
is
the
exactly
what
the
americans
with
the
disabilities
act
requires.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
has
joined.
