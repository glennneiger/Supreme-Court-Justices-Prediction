mr.
farr,
i
understand
you
are
behind
the
ropes,
you
say
those
are
the
spectators,
it's
a
public
accommodation
with
respect
to
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i'm,
i'm
sure
that
you
must
have
an
answer
to,
the
public
accommodations
provision
is
not
new
with
the
american
disabilities.
it
comes
up
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
where
the
concern
is
race.
now,
with
respect
to
race,
could
the
pga
say
that
we
don't
want
any
african
americans
to
play
in
our
game?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
your
answer
is
the
same
for
both?
that
neither
public
accommodation--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you're
saying
they
don't
come
under
the
employment
provisions
because
they're
not
employees,
not
coming
under
the
employment
provisions,
they
are
not
covered
at
all?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
but
as
far
as
the
public
accommodation
is
concerned,
you
are
being
consistent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
farr,
is
your
position
then,
clear
position
that
there
is
no
accommodation
required
in
a
professional
sport
competition,
that
the
rules
are
whatever
they
are,
and
there
is
no
requirement
to
adjust
to
any
disability?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you're
familiar
with
both
the
law
in
the
area
and
the
game
in
your
preparation
for
this,
for
this
argument,
so
you
could
not
think
of
any
concrete
example
of
where
there
would
be
any
requirement
to
accommodate
to
a
disability,
that
the
game
is
the
game?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
owens,
are...
mr.
reardon,
you
said
mr.
olinger's
case
was
different
because
it
was
on
a
different
record,
and
that's
somewhat
worrisome
because
let's
say
you're
right,
that
they
do
have
to
make
accommodations.
who
is
the
judge
of
whether
a
person
is
sufficiently
disabled
to
get
a
dispensation
from
the
nonfundamental
walking
requirement?
is
it
up
to
the
lawyers
and
the
quality
of
the
record
they
make?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
said
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
olinger
case
is
the
record,
and
that's
made
in
court
by
advocates
for
a
side.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
did
they
do
it
on
a
case
by
case
basis
or
did
they
say
we're
troubled
by
this
notion
because
we
think
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
will
say
it's
a
lot
harder
for
us
to
walk,
and
we
don't...
we
won't
know
where
to
draw
the
line?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
under
normal
circumstances.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
an
ambiguity
in
the
lower
court's
finding.
what
is...
isn't
a
tournament
at
the
height
of
the
competition
abnormal
circumstance
with
the
description
of
the,
of
the,
what
would
it
be,
the
extra
hole
and
the
humidity
and
the
rough
terrain.
that
doesn't
sound
to
me
like
normal
circumstances.
what,
what
was,
what
was
the
lower
court
intending
to
cover
with
that
qualifying
language?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
are
abnormal...
what
is
a
normal
circumstance
and
what
is
an
abnormal
circumstance?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
then
distinguishing
the
stage...
one
analogy
that
was
made
is
the
spectators
are
in
the
theater,
but
what's
going
on
in
the
stage,
those
people
are
not
relating
to
the
space
as
a
public
accommodation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
