mr.
farr.
justice
antonin
scalia
am
i
correct
that,
assuming
we
have
these
two
different
grounds,
if
we
go
on
your
first
ground,
and
agree
with
you
on
that,
namely,
that
this
is
not
an
individual
who
is
seeking
to
enjoy
the
place
of
public
accommodation,
the
pga
tour
would
nonetheless,
if
it
wishes,
be
able
to
grant
an
exception
in
the
future
to
casey
martin.
it
could
say
well,
we
don't
have
to
under
title
3,
but
we
are
going
to
do
it
voluntarily.
whereas,
if
we
go
on
your
second
ground,
mainly
that
it
is
a
fundamental
part
of
a
sport,
the
tour
wouldn't
be
able
to
make
such
an
exception,
would
it?
it
would
in
effect
be
admitting
that
it
is
not
a
fundamental
feature
of
the
sport.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
no,
make
an
exception
just
for
one,
for
one
member.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
you
could
change
it
for
everybody.
anybody
that
wants
to
ride
can
ride.
but
could
you
just
say
only
mr.
martin
can
ride?
could
they
do
that
if
we,
if
we,
if
the
basis
for
their
exemption
is
the
fact
that
walking
is
fundamental
to
the
sport?
justice
antonin
scalia
rules
are
rules,
and
therefore--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
therefore,
you
can't
make
an
exception
for
one
individual.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
and
as
soon
as
you
do
that,
then--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
would
we
say
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
a
what
school?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
reardon,
all
that
proves,
all
that
proves
is
that
you
could
play
golf
under
different
rules,
just
as
you
can
play
baseball
under
different
rules.
is
the...
is
the
designated
hitter
rule,
is
it
essential
to
the
game
of
baseball
that
the
pitcher
bat?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
play
under
different
rules.
but
every
team
in
each
league
has
to
play
under,
under
the
same
rule.
now,
could
a
pitcher
in,
in
the,
in
the
national
league,
which
follows
the
traditional
rule,
could
he
say
i
have
some
blood
deficiency
that
means
i
get
tired
sooner
than
other
pitchers,
and
therefore
i
shouldn't
have
to
go
up
to
bat.
i'd
like
to,
i'd
like
to
sit
in
the
dugout,
because
after
all,
the,
the
rule
that
the
pitcher
has
to
bat
is
not
fundamental
to
baseball.
the
american
league
doesn't
have
that
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
why.
simply
because
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--simply
because
that's
what
they
do.
that's
the
rule
of
the
game.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
that
it
demonstrates...
all
that
it
demonstrates
is
that
you
can
play
the
game
under
a
different
rule.
i
mean,
what...
i
don't
understand
the
whole
meaning
of
fundamentalness
with
regard
to
a
sport.
is
it
fundamental
to
baseball
that,
that
the
strike
zone
be
from
the
chest
to
the
knees?
it
could
be
from
the
eyes
to
the
hips,
couldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
make
any
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
could
a
player
who
has
a
disability,
which
means
he
has,
which
causes
him
to
have
an
excessively
long
torso,
could
he
demand
that
the
umpire
call
strikes
on
him
from,
you
know,
from
his
eyes
to
his
hips?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
he
couldn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
silly
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
sports
rules
are
silly
rules,
aren't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it's
quite
internal,
actually.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
reardon,
lest
we
seem
as
ignorant
of
the
rules
of
baseball
as
we
may
well
be
of
the
rules
of
golf,
and
the
former
would
be
a
much
greater
sin,
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
want
to
point--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
want
to
point
out
that
your,
your
colleague
does
not
agree
that
a
special
exception
was
made
for
jim
abbott,
that
they
believe
that
the
rules
of
baseball
did
not
prohibit
what
he
was
doing.
the
only
thing
that
was
prohibiting
was
deceiving
the
base
runner,
and
spinning
the
ball;
so
long
as
it
didn't
deceive
the
base
runner,
it
was
okay.
we
don't
have
to
resolve
that
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
students
are
not
performing.
the
professors
are
performing
and
the
students,
the
students
are
enjoying
the
performance
of
the
professors.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
any
different
with
respect
to
employees?
couldn't
you
say
that
awful
your
employees
are
enjoying
the
opportunity
to
work
for
you
in
the
place
of
public
accommodation
in
which
you
employ
them?
that
seems
to
me
perfectly
parallel
to
saying
that
these
professional
golfers
who
are
making
money
by,
by
putting
on
this
entertainment
are
enjoying
the
opportunity
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
independent
contractors
would
be
covered
then.
the
independent
contractors
who,
who
provide
services
to
the
owner
of
the
public
accommodation
are
enjoying
the
opportunity
to
provide
him
services.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
he...
doesn't
he
have
to
appear
in
a
certain
number
of
tournaments
per
year?
i
thought
that
was
part
of
the
commitment.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
just
like
saying
an
independent
contractor
doesn't
have
to
comply
with
his
contract
there.
the
only
thing
is
if
he
doesn't,
he
gets
fired.
i
mean,
it's
the
same
thing.
