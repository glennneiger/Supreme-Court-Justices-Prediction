justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
farr,
you
keep
talking
about
goods
and
services,
but
the
statute
is
not
limited
to
goods
and
services,
as
justice
o'connor's
question
indicated.
it
covers
the
enjoyment
of,
among
other
things,
privileges,
and
i,
it
seems
to
me
the
straightforward
argument
is
that
the
person
who
is
making
a
claim
here
is
somebody
who
says,
like
any
other
member
of
the
public,
i
paid
my
$3,000
and
i
got
my
two
references
and
i
want
to
enjoy
the
privilege
of
competing
at
this,
at
this
place
of
public
accommodation.
why
doesn't
it
literally
fall
within
that
quite
easily?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
but
that's,
that's
where
you
start.
that's
where
you
start.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
except
that
it
makes
a
difference
because
i
think
in
a
common
sense
kind
of
way
we
can
say
well,
he
is
not
getting
any
goods
and
services,
but
he
is
trying
to
exercise
a
privilege
of
playing.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
once
again,
when
you
phrase
it
the
way
you
do,
it
makes
it
easier
for
your
case.
you
say
a
person
supplying
labor
at
a
place
of
public
accommodation.
another
way
of
looking
at
it,
and
i
frankly
would
have
thought
in
this
circumstance
an
easier
way
of
looking
at
it
would
be
not
that
he's
supplying
labor,
but
that
he
wants
to
play
a
game
and
if
he
plays
the
game
well
enough
to
win
a
prize.
that's,
that
doesn't
fall
within
the
sort
of
aura
of
employment
that
title
1
covers.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
and
they
get...
and
each
one
of
them
gets
paid
by
his
employer
win,
lose
or
draw.
in
this
case,
maybe,
maybe
you'll
have
to
help
me
out
here.
i
thought
whether
one
got
paid
depended
on
whether
one
won
the
prize.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
except
that
the
statement
is
too
broad.
the
football
industry,
i
suppose,
does
not
say
we
will
give
anybody
who
wants
to
come
in
and
compete
for
a
place
on
our
team
a
spot.
they
are
not
going
to
invite
me
to
try
out.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
as
i
understand
it,
that,
that
is
what
is
at
stake
here.
anybody
who
can
start
at
the
first
qualifying
level
with
his
money
and
his
references
and
keep
on
playing
well
enough
is
in
a
position
the
way
the
pga
is
run
to
get
to
this
top
echelon
of
athletes
and
compete
for
a
prize.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
farr--
justice
david
h.
souter
your
argument
is--
--please,
go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
would
be
true
of--
justice
david
h.
souter
--this
would
be
true
of
amateur
sports,
as
well
as
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
it's
trying
to
winnow
the
wheat
from
the
chaff
in
a
way
that
amateur
sports
don't.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
they
took
them
by
cars,
i
take
it,
for
everybody.
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
therefore,
the
fact
that
they
took
them
by
cars
does
not
affect
the
assessment
of
the
relative
abilities
of
the
players,
because
they
all
got
the
same
dispensation.
your
brother's
argument
is
that
a
professional
sport
is
entitled
to
define
anything
as
fundamental
which
could
affect
the
relative,
the
measurement
or
the
indication
of
the
relative
ability
of
the
players.
and
he
says
walking
or
not
walking
does
make
that
kind
of
a
difference.
what
is
wrong...
and
we've
got
to
come
on
with
some
kind
of
a
standard
if,
no
matter
how
we
decide
this
case,
why
isn't
that
a
reasonable
standard
that
should
be
respected
under
the
act?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but...
the
game
can...
we're
not
talking
about
the
game
in
the
abstract.
we're
talking
about
the
pga
tour,
and
if
the
people
who
make
the
rules
for
the
pga
tour
say
we
want
to
make
this
particular
game
tougher
than
regular
golf
games,
we
are
going
to
separate
another
subset
of
people
by
making
them
walk,
or
at
least
making
them
walk
on
most
holes.
everybody
has
to
play
by
this
rule.
why,
if
that
could
be
outcome
determinative,
is
that
not
a,
number
one,
a
reasonable
way
for
them
to
draw
the
line,
and
why
shouldn't
we
respect
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
know
it.
but
their
argument
is,
that's...
but
you're
avoiding
my
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think.
their
argument
is
that
if
it
can
affect
the
results,
then
we
are
entitled
to
define
it
as
fundamental
in
this
kind
of
a
game.
you
may
argue
that
it
doesn't
affect
the
results
and
therefore
even
on
their
own
theory,
it
shouldn't
apply,
and
you
have
so
argued,
and
i
understand
that.
but
if
you're
not
right
about
that,
is
there
something
wrong
with
the
legal
criterion
that
they
are
arguing
for?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
understand
your
argument,
but
their
response
to
that
i
think
would
be
no,
it's
not
a
free
pass
because
if
you
can
in
fact
show
that
this
doesn't
affect
the
relative
measurement
of
the
players,
that
this
is
just
kind
of
a
sham,
then
we
couldn't
enforce
it.
it
wouldn't
be
fundamental
within
the
meaning.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
saying,
i
take
it
you're
saying
that
they
can't
sue,
the
tour
can't
sue
the
guy
that
doesn't
play
enough
games,
they
just
drop
him.
whereas,
they
can
sue
the
plumber
who
doesn't
come
if
you
have
to
hire
a
more
expensive
plumber.
