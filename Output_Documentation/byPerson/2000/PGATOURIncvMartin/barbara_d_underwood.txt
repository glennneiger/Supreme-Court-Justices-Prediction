ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
presents
an
important
question
of
the
coverage
of
the
disabilities
act,
as
well
as
an
issue
of
its
application.
when
an
organization
arranges
a
golf
tournament
and
invites
the
public
to
compete
for
the
opportunity
to
participate,
it
provides
golfers
with
services,
privileges,
and
advantages
of
the
golf
course.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
that's
rather
like
the
fact
that
a
university
that,
that
offers,
to
which
the
public
can
apply
doesn't
then
admit
the
whole
public.
it
has
a
selection
process,
and
so
what
only,
only
the
admitted
people
can
attend,
but
the
university
is
a
public
accommodation.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes.
that's
a
different
point.
all
i
meant
was
that
the
fact
that
there
is
a
selection
process
does
not
deprive
an
entity
of
its
status
as
a
public
accommodation.
if
it's
open
to
the
public
to
compete,
to
attend,
then
that
whole
process
is,
is
something
that's
open,
to
which
the
public
is
invited.
on
the
separate
point,
what
are
the
circumstances--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--you
might
be
able
to
say
that.
there
are
two...
the
words
would
allow
you
to
say
that.
there
are
two
reasons
why
you
wouldn't.
one
is
that
congress
made
very
clear
that
it
was
covering
employees
in
title
1
and
that
it
didn't
intend
to
provide
redundant
coverage
in
title
3
so
whatever
one
might
say
ab
initio,
that
possibility
is
excluded.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
i'd
like
to
take,
to
answer
that
in
two
steps
because
i
take
issue
with
the
proposition
that
these
are
employee
like
independent
contractors.
i
do
say
that
even
if
they
were,
they
would
be
covered,
but
this
is
a
much
stronger
case
because
in
fact,
there
is
no
independent
contracting
relationship
here.
the
golfer
does
not,
does
not
undertake
any
obligation
to
perform,
even
in
the
way
that
an
independent
contractor
does.
he
is
simply--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--he
doesn't
make
a
commitment
to...
it's
my
understanding
of
the
record
that
he
doesn't
make
a
commitment.
it
is
true
that
if
he
doesn't
appear,
he
won't
be
in
the
tour
anymore,
but
he,
by
qualifying
and
being
eligible
to
be
in
the
tour
does
not
make
a
commitment
to
participate.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
it's
not
quite
the
same
thing
because
there
is
no
contract,
there
is
no
contractual
commitment
here
at
all.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
correct.
in
fact,
pga
tour
explained
in
the
district
court
when
they
were
attempting
to
defeat
the
claim
that
this
was
an
employee,
that
it
doesn't
hire
golfers,
that
it's
a
membership
organization,
a
professional
association
that
arranges
playing
opportunities
for
its
members
and
promotes
their
interests.
it
compared
itself
to
the
aba
in
that
regard.
it
provides
opportunity
for
them.
it
provides
services
for
them.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no,
you
do
not.
in
the...
that
is,
the,
the
particular
sort
of
entity
or
status
of
respondent
here
is,
as
i
said,
a
much
clearer
case
that
he
is
a
consumer
of
the
services
or
the
privileges
or
advantages
of
a
public
accommodation.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
the
district
court
said
so
in
the
context
of
deciding
that
he
wasn't
an
employee,
as
if
the
only
two
options
were
that
he
was
an
employee
or
an
independent
contractor.
that
is,
in
deciding
that
he
couldn't
take
advantage
of
title
1
for
employees,
the
court
said
he
is
not
an
employee,
and
looked
to
the
body
of
law
that
said
people
who
aren't
employees
are
independent
contractors.
but
i
don't
think
that
resolves
the
question
whether
he
maybe
was
something
else
entirely,
a
member
or
a
potential
member
who
was
neither
an
employee
nor
an
independent
contractor
as
that
term
is
commonly
used
in
the
working
context.
he
simply
wasn't
a
worker
here
at
all.
petitioner
argues
that
players
can't
be
consumers
of
services
because
they
are
providers
of
entertainment
to
the
spectators,
but
that
is
simply
a
false
dichotomy.
pga
offers
services
to
these
two
different
groups.
it
arranges
playing
opportunities
for
golfers
and
viewing
opportunities
for
the
spectators.
as
a
result,
players
both
consume
and
provide
services
at
the
same
time,
just
like
the
little
league
players
who
have
uniformly
been
treated
by
the
lower
courts
as
protected
users
of
a
public
accommodation.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well
the
difference
is,
as
i
said,
i
think
there
is
an
argument
that
even
those
independent
contractors
could
be
covered,
that
the
disability
act
meant
to
open
economic
and
social
life
to
people
with
disabilities
and
that--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--yes.
i
think
the
simple
answer
here
is
that
the
privilege
of
working
for,
for
money
in
an
employee
like
role
is
simply
quite
different
from
what
is
happening
when
somebody
participates
in
a
competition.
the
public
accommodations
laws,
as
we
said
earlier,
protect
gamblers
at
a
casino,
or
exhibitors
at
a
craft
fair,
or
participants
in
a
dance
contest,
whether
there
are
money
prizes
or
not,
whether
the
people
who
are
engaging
in
those
competitions.
i
mean,
i
think
the...
are
doing
it
to
make
their
living
or
are
doing
it
as
an
avocation.
it
wouldn't
work
to
distinguish
the
motivations
of
the
different
users
of
the
services
of
that
accommodation.
they
wouldn't
be
protected
if
they
were
employees.
it's
perfectly
true
that
if
golf
arranged
itself
differently,
and
had
employees
here,
they
wouldn't
be
protected
under
title
3.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
the
difference
is
that
the
participation
in
a
contest
is
a
different
sort
of,
that
is
open
to
the
public,
is
a
different
sort
of
thing
from
the
cut
from
the
arrangement
by
contract,
by
employment
contract
or
by
some
other
contract
to
provide
services.
and
i'd
like
to
point
out,
of
course,
that
covering
people
like
independent
contractors
or
like
contest
participants,
which
is
what
we
have
here
under
title
3
is
not
as
has
been
suggested
some
sort
of
end
run
around
the
limitations
of
title
1.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
you're
making
a
comparison
to
the
theater,
you
mean?
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
in
a
theater,
of
course,
ordinarily
there
are
employees
so
this
issue,
they
ordinarily
are
employees
so
this
issue
doesn't
come
up.
i
would
suppose
though,
that
if,
if
a,
if
a
performer
sought
to
rent
a
performance
space,
he
would
be
a
consumer
of
the,
of
that
facility
and
could
claim
that
he
was
being
discriminated
against
as
a
consumer
of
that
facility.
that's
not
usually
the
way
performers
relate
to
performance
space.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
i
think
that
the
purpose
of
the
disabilities
act
was
to,
was
to
be
inclusive.
i
think
that's
clear
both
from
the
statute
and
from
the
legislative
history
so
that
i
would
suggest
that
if
there's,
that
doubts
should
be
resolved
here
in
favor
of
coverage.
but
i
don't
think
it's
unclear.
i
think
that,
that
the,
that
the
public
accommodations
title
was
meant
to
cover
golf
courses
and
participation
in
events
at
golf
courses
so
long
as
they
are
open
to
the
public.
and
it
seems
to
me
this
is
right
in
the
heart
of
what
the
statute
was
meant
to
reach.
