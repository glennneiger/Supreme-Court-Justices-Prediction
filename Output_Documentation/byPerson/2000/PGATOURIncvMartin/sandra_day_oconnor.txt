mr.
farr,
the
language
of
part
3
of
the
act
literally
could
cover
the
player.
it
says,
it
refers
to
any
individual,
and
it
refers
to
any
kind
of
advantage
or
privilege
on
a
golf
course.
so
you
have
to
construe
it
some
way,
it
seems
to
me,
to
avoid
that
language.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
reach
your
conclusion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
farr,
there
is
another
important
question
you
haven't
addressed.
if
we
assume
for
purposes
of
resolving
this
case
that
it
is
a
place
of
public
accommodation,
then
there
is
a
second
question
about
what
kind
of
accommodation
is
required.
are
you
going
to
talk
about
that
before
your
time
is
up?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
reardon,
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
a
strikingly
similar
case
to
this
one
determined
at
the
end
of
the
day
that
the
walking
rule
was
fundamental
because
it
put
additional
physical
stress
on
each
competitor
after
a
tournament
lasting
several
days
and
perhaps
in
hotter
inclement
weather,
and
on
hilly
conditions,
it
could
impose
quite
an
additional
stress
on
the
players
in
the
final
rounds.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
therefore,
that
it
was
an
aspect
of
the
physical
challenge
involved.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--wait
a
minute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i...
may
i
ask
you,
ms.
underwood,
if
whether
to
decide
in
your
favor,
we
have
to
determine
the
general
applicability
of
title
3
of
the
ada
to
independent
contractors?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
wait.
it
was
determined
in
this
case,
as
i
understood
it,
that
he
was
an
independent
contractor;
at
least
the
district
court
thought
so.
