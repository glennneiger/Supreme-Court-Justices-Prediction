g.

well
all
that...
i
mean,
this...
that's
true,
that's
it's
a
very,
it's
an
unusual
situation
here,
and
we
could
go
on
forever
about
the
pros
and
cons
and
who
they
are
really
like.
but
people
go
to
race
courses
for
entertainment,
but
a
few
go
to
earn
a
living.
they're
touts.
some
people
go
to
casinos
for
fun
and
an
occasional
person
goes
there
to
earn
a
living.
so,
given
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
and
the
language
of
the
statute,
why
does
that
make
any
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
not
going
to
say
a
person
who
goes
to
a
race
course,
happens
to
make
a
living
out
of
it,
therefore,
he
couldn't
sue
if
it's
otherwise
a
public
accommodation,
and
i
think
you'd
say
the
same
about
all
the
unusual
cases
we
can
think
of.
why
should
this
make
a
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
are
these
people
because
after
all,
the
golf
course
is
leased
by
the
pga
to
use
to
play
golf
for
that
day.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
couldn't
we
make
that
same
argument.
why
couldn't
that
same
argument
be
made
by
anyone
who
provides
an
important
public
service?
you
know,
we
have
a
bunch
of
rules,
characteristics,
qualifications.
we
don't
want
courts
in
there
weighing
the
importance
of
this
good
or
service
or
privilege.
therefore,
if
it
affects
the
nature
of
the
good,
service
or
privilege,
it's
fundamental,
which
is
the
argument
you
are
making.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
always
do,
to
some
tiny
degree.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what,
what
is
the
rule?
didn't
organized
baseball
waive
a
rule
in
the
case
of
jim
abbott,
who
had,
i
think,
a
hand...
what
was
the
rule
they
waived?
do
you
remember?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
waived
that
rule.
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
how
are
we
supposed
to
find
out
whether
this
rule
is
more
like
that
rule
of
looking
at
the
ball
in
baseball,
or
whether
it's
more
like
the
rule
that
justice
scalia
mentioned,
namely
the
rule
of
having
a
designated
hitter?
how
is
the...
how
are
we
supposed
to
decide
whether
the
rule
is
the
one
or
the
other?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know.
but
you
realize
i'm
not
the
one
who
will
know
that.
i'm
not
very
good
at
golf.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the...
the...
the
real
question
is
some
rules
are
like
the
designated
hitter
and
they
are
part
of
the
game.
other
rules
are
like
whether
you
look
at
the
baseball
before
you
throw
it
or
hold
it
to
your
chest,
which
isn't
part
of
the
game,
at
least
not
an
essential
part.
now,
how
did
we
find
out
which
is
which
because
the
question
was
raised
and
i
want
to
be
clear
what
the
answer
to
that
is,
and
how
do
we
find
out?
not
we,
me
personally.
what's
the
system
for
finding
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
who?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
courts
look
at
that
like
they
look
at
any
other
rule
of
any
other
employer,
public
accommodation,
et
cetera?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
your
opinion,
does
it
make
a
difference
if,
if
there
is
no
easy
classification,
that
is,
if
a
professional
golfer
is
somehow
unique,
not
this,
not
some
other
thing,
not
an
employee,
not
a
contractor,
not
a
client,
not
exactly
a
customer,
not
a
this,
not
a
that.
does
it
matter?
