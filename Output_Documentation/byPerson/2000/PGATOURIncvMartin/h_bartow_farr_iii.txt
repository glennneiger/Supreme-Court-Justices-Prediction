mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
ninth
circuit
in
our
view
made
two
critical
mistakes
in
applying
the
disabilities
act
to
this
type
of
claim
by
a
professional
athlete.
first
it
failed
to
recognize
that
title
3
of
the
act,
the
public
accommodations
provision,
apply
only
to
claims
by
persons
seeking
to
obtain
inputs
of
a
place
of
public
accommodation,
that
is
seeking
to
enjoy
its
goods
or
services,
not
to
claims
by
persons
seeking
to
supply
inputs
as
employees
or
independent
contractors.
second,
the
ninth
circuit
never
took
account
of
just
what
a
top
level
professional
sport
really
is,
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
competition
that
tests
excellence
in
performing
what
its
rules
require.
any
attempt
to
adjust
the
rules
to
compensate
for
an
individual
player's
physical
condition
fundamentally
alters
the
nature
of
that
competition.
now
in
turning
to
the
first
issue,
our
position
is
simply
this.
that
title
3
of
the
act
would
not
apply
if
respondent
were
playing
in
tour
events
as
an
employee
of
the
tour,
and
the
results
should
be
no
different
just
because
he
is
playing
in
the
events--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
i
mean,
the
argument--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that's
correct.
the
argument
made
by
respondent
is
essentially
that
title
3
covers
any
person
who
is
present
at
a
place
of
public
accommodation,
whatever
he
or
she
is
doing
there,
whether
they
are
a
customer,
an
employee
or
an
independent
contractor.
i
think
that's
wrong
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
just
looking
at
the
specific
language
that
you
point
to,
the
notion
of
full
and
equal
enjoyment
of
goods
and
services,
it
seems
to
me,
is
quite
different
from
the
notion
of
being
allowed
to
provide
the
goods
and
services.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
if
i
may
separate
this
into
two
things,
because
the
$3,000
applies
only
to
a
very
small
piece,
which
is
the
qualifying
tournament.
there
is
no
requirement
playing
on
the
tour
itself
or
on
the
nike
tour.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
but
that's
where
one
starts.
but
in
terms
of
privilege,
i'm
using
the
term
goods
and
services
not
to
skip
over
the
others,
but
simply
as
a
shorthand
reference
to
all
of
that.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
except
for,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
fact
the
word
privilege,
if
it
means
the
privilege
to
work
for
a
place
of
public
accommodation,
to
provide
the
input
of
labor
to
a
place
of
public
accommodation,
then
naturally
following
that
logic,
title
3
would
apply
to
anybody,
an
employee,
an
independent
contractor
or
anyone.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
think
it
does,
to
be
honest
with
you,
justice
souter.
for
example,
this
happens
to
be
a
game
of
golf.
but
if
one
thinks
of
the
game
of
football,
for
example,
professional
football
is
a
game
that
is
played
by
employees.
they
are,
they
are
hired
i
think,
basically
by
the
teams.
they
compete
against
each
other.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
it
depends
on
performance
but
in
a
very
specific
sense
of
course,
the
performance
by
any
professional
athlete
determines
ultimately
what
he
or
she
gets
paid.
so
if
in
fact
one
can
say
it
is
a
privilege
of
a
place
of
public
accommodation
to
be
able
to
compete
in
a
professional
sport,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
would
apply
to
any
professional
sport.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i'm
not
sure
what
difference
that
makes,
justice
souter,
because
in
a
sense,
anybody
can
compete
to
play
on
a
professional
football
team.
i
mean,
professional
football
teams
are
drawn
from
the
public
at
large--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--if
they
are
good
enough
to
qualify.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
the...
the
thing
that
i
think
makes
it
more
confusing,
it
seems,
is
that
normally,
our
position
would
be
that
the
opportunity
to
earn
something,
to
start
with,
without
using
the
words
win
a
prize
from
it,
but
the
opportunity
to
earn
something
would
not
be
the
kind
of
privilege
or
good
or
service
that
is
being
offered
by
a
place
of
public
accommodation.
indeed,
people
who
want
to
provide
the
inputs
would
be
the
kinds
of
people
who
wanted
to
provide
services
and
earn
what
they
would
get
in
return.
i
think
what
makes
this
case
seem
different
is
because
what
respondent
in
fact
does
for
a
living
is
something
that
other
people
do
for
recreational
purposes
or
part
of
educational
purposes.
but
again,
to
take
an
example,
if
the
tour
constructed
its
operation
just
slightly
differently,
instead
of
saying
we
will
have
everybody
just
compete
for
the
prizes
as
independent
contractors,
if
they
said
what
we
will
do
is
we
will
hire
a
group
of
approximately
200
professional
golfers,
we'll
make
them
employees,
we'll
pay
them
a
modest
salary,
just
enough
to
kind
of
cover
their
expenses
as
they
play
and
then
whatever
they
win
over
and
above
that,
that
will
be
their
earnings.
now,
our
argument
would
be
that
in
that
arrangement,
the
tour
would
clearly
not
be
subject
to
suits
by
those
golfers
under
title
3.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
they
might
be
subject
to
suit--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--because
title
1
is
the
title
of
this
act
that
deals
with
that
kind
of
issue,
the
question
of
relationships
between
people
who
are
providing
labor
and
the
people
who
are
paying
for
it.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
it
makes
a--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i
think
the
difference
between
the
examples
you
are
using,
justice
breyer,
and
this
example,
is
those,
the
people
who
go
to
the
race
tracks,
some
of
whom
may
go
to
make
a
living,
are
essentially
doing
the
same
thing,
receiving
the
same
outputs,
if
you
will,
from
the
race
track,
as
the
people
who
are
there
simply
for
recreational
purposes.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
but,
but
i
think
the
difference,
justice
breyer,
is
that
at
the
time
the
tournament
is
going
on,
in
fact,
there
are
no
people
there
playing
for
recreational
purposes.
during
the
time
of
the
tournament,
which
is
the
time
when
the
pga
is
operating
the
place
of
public
accommodation,
that's
what's
bringing
the
pga
within
title
3
with
respect
to
the
spectators,
for
example,
is
because
it's
operating
a
particular
tournament
at
a
place
of
public
accommodation.
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that's
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
title
2
does
not
apply,
we
believe,
in
the
same
circumstances
as
we
don't
think
title
3
of
the
ada
applies,
to
situations
in
which
somebody
is
simply
seeking
to
provide,
seeking
to
obtain
employment
or
trying
to
obtain
work
as
an
independent
contractor,
so
title
2
of
the
civil
rights
act
would
not
apply
in
that
case.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
for
both
those
situations.
now
of
course,
the...
the
disabilities
act
itself
and
of
course
the
civil
rights
acts
that
apply
to
race,
and
sex
and
age
have
provisions
that
deal
specifically
with
the
question
of
who
is
working
at
different
places
and
claims
about
discrimination,
saying
the
terms
and
conditions
that
you
have
set
for
a
particular
job
are
discriminating
against
me.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
under
the
disabilities
act,
and
not
under
title
2.
whether
there
are
other
provisions
like
section
1981,
for
example,
in
the
case
of
race,
might
extend
protection
in
that
situation.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
the
public
accommodations
provisions
in
our
view
are
intended
again
to
deal
with
essentially
people
who
are
consumers,
clients
and
customers.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it
is
a
modified
version
of
the
second,
justice
stevens.
it
is
that
they
are
not
individuals
seeking
full
and
equal
enjoyment
of
goods,
services,
privilege
and
accommodations,
as
those
terms
are
properly
interpreted.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
the
area
generally.
there
is
a
difficulty.
i
mean,
one
of
the
questions
that
one
has
is,
is
every
piece
of
the
property
a
place
of
public
accommodation
or
is
the...
are
the
ropes,
for
example,
dividing
a
place
of
public
accommodation
from
a
place
that
isn't?
that
is
one
way
to
look
at
it.
in
our
view,
the
simpler
way
to
look
at
it
is
the
second
way
that
you
have
which
is
to
say,
you
have
to
be
asking
in
this
question,
is
the
person
an
individual
receiving
the
kind
of
goods,
services
and
privileges
that
are
covered?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
but
that's
because,
that's
because
they
clearly
are.
the
tour
doesn't
deny.
it's
putting
on
an
entertainment.
it
is
putting
on
an
entertainment
to
which
spectators
are
allowed,
so
if
one
asks,
is
the
golf
course
at
this
moment
a
place
of
exercise
or
recreation,
as
that's
typically
thought
of
under
title
3,
our
answer
would
be,
i
think
the
better
view
is
no.
and
the
ninth
circuit
actually
interestingly
didn't
say
that
it
was
a
place
of
exercise
or
recreation
and
noted
that
we
made
the
argument
it
wasn't
and
basically
said
be
that
as
it
may,
it
is
a
place
of
entertainment,
and
we...
and
what
we
are
saying
is
yes,
it
is
a
place
of
entertainment
and
there
are
people
present
at
the
tournaments
who
in
fact
are
enjoying
goods
and
service
and
enjoying
the
entertainment
that
we
are
providing.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
but
the
golfers
are
part
of
the
entertainment.
excuse
me.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
justice
kennedy,
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
that.
i
mean,
if,
if...
the
thing
that
makes
the
tour
have
the
obligations
to
the
spectators
is
the
fact
that
they
are
operating
a
place
of
public
accommodation
during
the
tournaments.
you
have
to
be
operating
a
place
of
public
accommodation
before
you
become
subject
to
title
3.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
but
justice
kennedy,
the
tour
isn't
an
abstraction.
the
tour
literally
is,
are
a
series
of
events
put
on
by
a
501(c)(6)
organization,
a
non
stock
membership
organization,
and
they
are
put
on
for
the
purposes
of
providing
entertainment
to
the
public.
that
entertainment,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
product
that
they
offer
at
a
place
of
public
accommodation.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
yes,
justice
o'connor.
let
me
talk
about
that
now,
if
i
may.
the...
if
one
assumes
for
a
moment,
and
for
example,
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
olinger
case
just
assumed
that
title
3
did
apply
to
the
type
of
claim
that
the
professional
golfer
there
made.
if
one
assumes
that,
then
the
question
is
whether
the
modification
that's
requested
here
would
fundamentally
alter
the
nature
of
tour
events,
and
i
think
that
where
the
ninth
circuit
went
wrong
on
that
particular
question
is
that
it
never
really
came
to
grips
with
what
professional
athletics
are.
the
professional
athletics
are
as
i
said
in
the
beginning,
simply
tests
of
excellence.
they
are
questions
of
who
can
perform
the
best
a
particular
set
of
physical
tasks,
and
those
tasks
are
defined
by
the
rules
of
the
sport.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
not...
never
in
a
high
level
tour
event,
your
honor.
there
has
never
been
a
situation
in
the
events
we
are
talking
about,
which
is
the
events
on
the
highest
level
pga
tours
where
they
have
allowed
different
people--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--oh,
qualifying
tours--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
because
the,
the
principal
events
that
they
put
on
are,
of
course,
the
events
of
the
tour
themselves,
the
two
highest
level
events.
qualifying
involves
simply
questions
of
logistics
to
be
honest.
there
are,
there
are
many
more
people
who
are
playing.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
first
of
all,
let
me
make--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
let
me
make
one
point.
that
when
carts
are
allowed,
they
are
allowed
for
all
players,
and
that
is
essentially
because
there
are
choices
that
the
tour
has
to
make
at
any
particular
time
about
whether
or
not
there
are
enough
caddies
available,
whether
there
is
enough
time
on
the
golf
course
to
get
however
many
people
there
are
through
the
event
in
order
to
produce
whatever
result
they
are
looking
for.
with
respect
to
the
events
we
are
talking
about,
the
actual
competitions
on
the
pga
tour,
on
the
[buydotcom]
tour,
which
is
the
second
level
tour,
the
tour
has
always
required
that
all
competitors
observe
all
the
same
rules,
including
the
walking
rule.
there
have
been
no
exceptions
to
that
whatsoever.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
want
to
make
clear
two
points.
first
of
all,
that
when
i
talk
about
rules,
i
am
talking
about
what
we
have
called
in
the
case
substantive
rules.
and
that
is
rules
that
are
intended
to
and
do
have
the
potential
to
affect
performance
and
the
outcome
of
the
tournament.
so
first
of
all,
when
i'm
using
the
term
rules,
i
am.
secondly,
though,
the
question
is
if,
if
you
are
saying
do
we
mean
that
for
any
rule,
or
any
accommodation,
i
think
the
correct
answer
is
yes,
although
one
sort
of
instinctively
would
think
that
there
should
be
some
process
by
which
people
can
separate
the
performance
affecting
rules
that
really
count
from
the
performance
affecting
rules
that
don't
really
count.
i
actually
don't
think
there
is
such
a
process.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
in
a
professional
sport,
i
think
that's
true,
that
the
purpose
of
a
professional
sport
is
one
thing
and
one
thing
only.
it's
to
determine
who
is
the
best
at
doing
a
certain
set
of
defined
tasks.
if
you
change
what
the
tasks
are,
if
you
change
the
rules
that
people
have
to
comply
with
so
that
you
have
different
rules
for
different
players,
you
are
not
going
to
get
an
answer
to
the
question
of
who
is
the
best
at
that
particular
thing.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
our
second
argument
is
slightly
different,
justice
scalia.
i
agree
with
the
first
part
to
start
with.
yes.
i
think
if
the
court
would
agree
on
the
first
issue
that
the
tour
could,
and
i
think
the
tour
could
under
the
second,
simply
by
changing
what
the
rules
of
the
sport
are.
our
position
is
not
that
there
is
such
a
thing--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--but
then
you--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i
think
it's...
again,
our
argument,
just
to
make
sure
i'm
being
clear,
is
not
that
we
are
contesting,
contending
that
there
is
a
difference,
that
there
are
fundamental
rules
and
nonfundamental
rules.
we
can
tell
which
one
is
which,
and
walking
is
a
fundamental
rule.
if
there
were
such
a
way
to
tell,
we
think
walking
would
be
a
fundamental
rule.
but
our
position
in
fact
is
that
all
the
substantive
rules
are
fundamental
rules.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
rules
are
rules.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
you
cannot
because
you
absolutely--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--you
have
to
have
the
uniformity
in
order
to
be
able
to
measure
what
you
do.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
what
is
fundamental--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i...
yes.
except,
again,
i
want,
i
want
to
be
clear
that
what
in
fact
is
fundamental
to
any
particular
game
is
the
rules
of
the
sport.
that
is
what
defines
what
the
sport
is.
therefore,
if
there
is
not
a
rule
against
it,
by
definition
it's
not
something
that
potentially
affects
the
outcome
of
the
sport
as
played
under
its
rules.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
pardon
me?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
the
difference
in
amateur
sports
and
the
thing
that
makes,
makes
the,
when
you
apply
the
fundamental
alteration
language
is
that
the
fundamental,
when
you
talk
about
fundamentally
altering
the
nature
of
a
particular
good
or
service,
that
requires
looking
at
what
the
nature
of
the
particular
good
or
service
is.
the
nature
of
a
professional
sport
is
very
different,
i
think,
from
the
nature
of
most
amateur
sports.
probably
not
all.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
not
only
that.
i
mean,
amateur
sports
do
that
to
some
extent
as
well,
but
amateur
sports
by
definition,
and
particularly
high
school,
college,
grade
school
sports,
things
like
that,
have
as
part
of
their
very
nature,
part
of
their
very
reason
for
being,
an
educational
or
recreational
side.
and
therefore,
when
one
comes
to
apply
any
fundamentally
altered
language
to
the
nature
of
that,
essentially
amateur
sports,
most
amateur
sports
have
a
dual
nature.
they
have
a
nature
that
involves
sort
of
sorting
winners
from
losers,
but
they
also
have
a
nature
that
says
we
are
trying
to
get
as
many
kids
in
the
high
school
or
whatever
to
play.
professional
sports
are
not--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
if
it's
actually
changing
what
the
good
or
service
is--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
if
it
changes
the
nature
then
though,
i
think
one
therefore,
one
has
to
look
at
the
regulations
for
some
guidance.
and
the
regulations...
i'd
like
to
take
just
a
minute
before
i
reserve
my
time,
if
i
may,
but
the
regulations
are
something
that
because
the
united
states
hasn't
cited
them,
i
think
maybe
get
lost
a
little
bit
here.
but
under
the
regulations
in
title
3,
there
is
a
specific
provision
that
says
a
public
accommodation
does
not
have
to
change
its
inventory
to
accommodate
disabled
people.
and
the
reason
given
for
that
in
the
preamble
of
the
regulations
is
that
title
3
requirements
are
intended
to
assure
access
to
the
goods
and
services
being
provided,
not
to
alter
the
mix
in
nature
of
the
services
typically
provided.
now,
typically
provided
in
this
context
we
would
say
are
the
tournaments
with
uniform
rules,
including
the
walking
rule,
at
the
very
highest
level.
that
is
one
that
has
been
typically
provided.
and
the
reason
i
think
for
that,
and
i
think
this
goes
to
your
question,
justice
breyer,
is
that
in
a
sense,
any
store
or
commercial
entity
is
just
whatever
its
goods
are,
a
bookstore.
an
example
is
a
bookstore
does
not
have
to
stock
braille,
braille
books.
and
there
isn't
an
inquiry
every
time
as
to
how
much
trouble
it
would
be
to
stock
braille
books,
whether
there's
shelf
space,
whether
they
could
get
them
or
not.
there's
a
categorical
rule
in
the
regulations
that
says
that's
not
what
we're
talking
about,
that
would
be
a
fundamental
alteration,
and
that's
exactly
the
same
point
we
are
making
here.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
excuse
me.
just
a
few
brief
points.
responding
in
reverse
order
to
the
united
states'
argument,
first
of
all,
they
say
that
the
reason
that
employers,
employees
are
not
covered
by
title
3
is
because
that
covers
title
1,
but
title
1
doesn't
cover
all
employees.
it
only
covers
employees
of
a
covered
employer.
you
have
to
have
at
least
15
employees
to
be
covered
and
if
you
are
not
an
employee
of
a
covered
employer,
you
are
not
covered
either.
yet,
the
united
states'
position
is
that
no
employees
are
covered
by
title
3,
but
really
independent
contractors
or
people
similar
to
that
are
in
the
same
position
essentially
with
respect
to
title
3
as
noncovered
employees
under
title
1.
secondly,
the
district
court
specifically
said
that
respondent
was
an
independent
contractor,
not
just
in
talking
about
title
1,
but
on
page
53
of
the
joint
appendix,
it
says,
the
district
court
says,
i
focus
only
on
the
issue
of
whether
he
is
entitled
to
his
requested
accommodation,
the
use
of
a
golf
cart,
as
an
independent
contractor
playing
in
defendant's
tournaments
which
are
held
at
places
of
public
accommodation.
now...
but
i
should
point
out,
i
mean,
while
he
is
an
independent
contractor
as
defined
by
the
district
court,
our
point
is
not
exactly
it
turns
on
whether
he
is
an
employee
or
an
independent
contractor.
our
point
is
he
is
not
a
consumer
of
goods
and
services,
and
there
are
a
number
of
people
who
are
not
consumers.
employees
are
in
the
group.
independent
contractors
are
in
the
group.
partners
in
a
law
firm,
which
is
a
type
of
public
accommodation,
are
not
in
the
group.
insurance
agents
are
not
in
the
group.
the
issue
is
what
they
are
not.
they
are
not
people
obtaining,
seeking
to
obtain
or
gain
access
to
goods
and
services.
they
are
all
in
the
category
of
people
who
are
providing
goods
and
services
to
the
public
accommodation
so
it
in
turn
can
provide
its
goods
and
services
to
other
people.
secondly,
just
to
make
the
contrast
between
the
people
who
are
also
playing
golf
and
who
are
covered,
title
3,
we
concede,
it
covers
commercial
opportunities,
recreational
opportunities,
educational
opportunities.
those
are
all
things
specifically
mentioned
in
title
3
in
terms
of
defining
who's
a
public
accommodation.
what
it
doesn't
cover
is
professional
opportunities,
the
people
who
are
trying
to
get,
to
make
their
living
essentially
working
for
the
place,
the
operator,
the
public
accommodation.
so
they
are
not
like
the
tout
at
the
race
track
who
is
there
in
common
with
the
other
people
enjoying
it
for
recreation.
they
are
people
actually
working
like
somebody
who
is
behind
the
betting
counter
at
the
race
track
who
is
working
for
the
operator.
now,
just
quickly
on
the
points
that
respondent
raises,
rule
1.1
doesn't
say
golf
is
a
sport
of
hitting
the
ball
from
the
tee
to
the
putting
hole.
it
says
it's
a
game
of
hitting
it
from
the
tee
to
the
putting
hole
in
accordance
with
the
rules.
that
is
rule
1.1.
and
the
rules
for
this
particular
competition
include,
as
there
are
permitted
to
be,
optional
rules,
and
that
in
turn
includes
the
requirement
that
competitors
walk
the
course.
so
if
you,
if
you
are
saying
that
you
cannot,
that
you
have
to
make
waivers
in
that
situation
for
someone
who
can't
comply,
then
you
are
changing
the
game.
