mr.
roy
l.
reardon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
take
the
liberty
of
beginning
with
petitioner's
second
point,
because
i
think
it's
something
we
have
recently
heard
discussed
here,
and
it's
i
think
quite
important.
from
1965
until
1997,
the
pga
ran
a
q
school
to
determine--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--it's
a
q,
they
call
it
the
q
school.
it's
a
qualifying
school,
your
honor.
and
the
purpose
of
that
q
school
is
to
determine,
it's
a
test
of
excellence,
as
petitioner
said,
to
determine
who
is
the
best
and
who
can
go
on
the
tour
the
following
year.
it's
a
very
intense
course.
there
are
14
sessions,
252
holes
played
on
courses
just
like
the
pga's
regular
courses
that
they
play
their
tournaments
on.
the
hard
card,
which
is
described
in
the
briefs
as
the
rules
which
impact
tennis
tournaments,
golf
tournaments
under
the
pga,
the
hard
card
applies
to
those
events,
but
the
walking
provision
of
the
hard
card
is
eliminated
for
purposes
of
the
q
school,
and
what
happens
is
there
is
a
winnowing
down
process.
in
1997,
when
casey
tried
out,
there
was
something
like
1,200
people,
golfers
from
the
public,
who
wanted
to
play
on
the
pga
tour.
and
they
came
in,
paid
their
money,
had
their
references,
and
started
to
play,
and
they
winnow
it
down
to
168
players
by
the
third
stage.
every
one
of
those
168
players
is
going
to
either
go
on
the
pga
tour
the
next
year
or
on
the
nike
tour
at
the
time,
and
none
of
those
players
need
ever
have
walked
a
single
hole,
not
only
in
the
qualifying,
but
in
their
lives.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
there
are
two
leagues.
one
league
has
it.
one
league
doesn't.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
well,
for
the
national
league,
it
is
fundamental.
and
it
would
not
be
permissible
because
you
would
be
changing--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--you're
changing--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--but
your
honor,
but
your
honor...
i
cite,
i
cite
what
happens
in
the
q
school
to
demonstrate
the
fact
that
walking
is
not
indeed
fundamental
because
they
don't
require
it.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
it
could.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
rules
could
be
changed.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
no,
he
could
not,
your
honor.
because
a
fundamental--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--it's
fundamental.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
it's
fundamental
to
the
game.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
i
don't
think
it's
a
silly
rule.
i
think
it
gauges
how
well
the
pitcher
can
control
the
ball
and
get
it
within
the
strike
zone.
here
we
are
dealing
with
something
that
isn't
fundamental.
not
only
in
the
q
school.
any
monday,
a
golfer
with
a
two
handicap
and
two
letters
of
reference
can
go
out
to
a
pga
tournament
that's
about
to
be
run
that
week
and
they
show
up
and
they
present
their
handicap
and
their
letters
of
reference.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
that
case
is
in
this
court.
that
case
was
decided
on
a
different
record
from
this
record.
that
case
i
don't
think
went
into
a
very
material
aspect
of
the
proof
in
our
case,
which
was
the
nature
of
the
disability,
this
tragic
disability
that
he
has,
and
what
it
did
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
a,
a
rule
which
would
require
him
to
walk
should
be
altered.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
basically
because
if
it
doesn't,
then
you
are
not
really
gauging
the
second
part,
which
is
to
consider
whether
or
not
an
alteration
is
going
to
do
something
fundamentally.
if
it's
a
superficial
disability,
giving
a
player
an
advantage
may
indeed
result
in
an
alteration
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
ingrown
toenail,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
i
agree
with
that,
but,
but
the
act,
the
act--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--the
act
does
not
accommodate
that
kind
of
a
disability.
casey
martin's
disability
is
indeed
accommodated.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
i
think
it's
initially
up
to
the
public
accommodation,
in
this
case
the
pga,
to
look
at
it
and
decide.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
yes,
it
is.
but
i'm
talking
about
in
advance
of
it
getting
to
the
courthouse.
if
the
pga
had
done
what
i
respectfully
suggest
the
law
demands
of
it,
which
was
to
take
a
look
at
the
nature
of
the
disability,
the
individual
disability
of
casey
martin,
rather
than
returning
his
medical
records
without
looking
at
them,
and
returning
the
tape
demonstrating
the
gravity
of
his
problem,
they
would
have
seen
the
disability
and
in
those
circumstances--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--respectfully,
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
believe
there
will
be
a
lot
of
cases,
a
lot
of
people.
because
just
taking
our
1997
case,
the
pga
has
not
had
another
lawsuit
by
a
disabled
person.
the
usga,
which
is
here,
has
had
two
lawsuits,
basically
similar
facts.
now,
there
has
not
been
a
huge
wave
of
litigation
and
the
reason
is,
a
person
like
casey
martin
is
very
unique.
he
never
asked
for
any
modification
of
any
rule
affecting
where
he
hits
the
ball,
how
big
the
hole
is
or
anything
else.
he
plays
every
single
rule
of
the
game.
the
only
thing
is
his
disability
and
the
whole
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
get
people
like
casey
martin
a
chance
to
get
to
the
game.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
as
i
understand
the
rule,
your
honor,
basically
in
baseball
the
pitcher
is
not
supposed
to
move
the
ball
in
his
hand
prior
to
delivery.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
regular
pitchers
take
the
ball,
as
you
see,
they
take
it
into
their
chest,
hold
the
ball
behind
the
glove
and
then
make
the
delivery.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
okay.
i
think
what's
very
important
is
to
understand
what
the
game
is,
what
is
the
competition?
now,
when
you
look
at
the
rules
of
golf,
promulgated
by
the
u.s.
golf
association
and
st.
andrews,
this
is
the
bible
of
golf.
if
you
want
to
play
golf
virtually
in
the
world,
you
play
by
these
rules.
what
do
these
rules
say?
rule
one
of
the
game
of
golf,
hitting
the
ball
from
the
teeing
ground
into
the
hole
by
a
stroke
or
successive
strokes.
that's
the
game.
there
is
no
rule
in
the
rules
of
golf--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--i
would
respectfully
suggest
the
system
is
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
rule.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
initially
it
would
be
the
public
accommodation.
if
they
don't
agree
that
there
should
be
a
waiver
of
the
rule,
then
it
has
to
go
on
up
the
line,
including
to
courts,
if
that's
required.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
yes.
i
don't
see
anything
quite
frankly
respectfully,
extraordinary
about
that.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
actually,
justice
kennedy,
if
you
wind
up
giving
substantial
deference,
in
other
words,
if
you
roll
over
and
let
them
make
a
rule
and
say
it's
substantive,
and
that's
the
end
of
the
game,
then
you
are
basically
giving
them
a
free
pass
out
of
the
americans
with
disabilities
act,
which
would
be
improper.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
but
it's,
it's
not
just
a
decision
by
the
sport.
there
is
an
implication,
and
a
very
significant
implication
in
the
statute,
which
requires
the
analysis.
this
is
not
something
where
congress
said
sports
can
have--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--i
would...
i'm
trying
to
live
with
both
theories,
if
your
honor
please.
but
i
do
believe--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--that
looking
at,
at
his
disability
is
very
important.
because
it
enables
the
one
making
the
judgment
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
modification,
taking
into
account
his
circumstances,
is
really
significant.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
i
don't
know
if
i've
answered
your
question,
justice
stevens,
but
i
think
it
largely
turns
initially
at
least
on
the
condition
of
the
disabled
person,
and
you
look
at
that.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
no.
your
honor,
i
think
if
you
examine
the
way
the
pga
has
handled
the
whole
walking
rule,
it's
replete
with
exceptions,
that
you
can't
have
all
of
those
exceptions
and
then
argue
it's
essential
because
that's
what
the...
you
get
to
the
definition--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--but
if
you're
testing
the
same
skills,
that's
very
important
to
my
argument,
that
what
are
you
testing.
and
when
you
look
at
the
way
they
handled
the
exceptions
throughout,
this
is
the
over
50s,
just
last
week
in
hawaii,
and
this
is
not
in
the
brief,
but
examples
like
this
are
in
the
brief.
there
are
a
couple
of
holes
out
in
hawaii
on
the
mercedes
championship
that
were
difficult
for
the
players
to
negotiate
because
they
were
hilly.
they
took
them
by
cars.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
everybody.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
because
walking
is
not
the
game.
the
game
is
hitting
the
ball
and--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--i
think
it...
you
still
have
to
look
at
the
rule
to
see
whether
that
rule
as
imposed,
or
as
modified,
giving
an
exception,
would
fundamentally
alter
that
game.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
i'm
sorry.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
your
honor,
what
i
think
is
wrong
with
it
is
that
you
would
basically
be
giving
the
pga
and
organized
sports
a
free
pass
out
from
under
the--
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
--and
we
haven't
proposed
the
rule
as
a
sham,
but
we
have,
and
rely
upon
the
record,
which
reflects
the
trial
judge's
conclusion
after
a
six
day
trial,
that
walking
was
not
a
significant
matter.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
under
normal
circumstances.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
i,
i
can
only
suggest,
and
there
was
testimony
with
respect
to
the
u.s.
open,
which
was
held
here
in
washington
in
1964,
testimony
by
the
player
who
won
it,
mr.
venturi.
and
his
testimony
was
that
he
literally
did
get
exhausted.
there
was
counter
testimony
that
said
the
exhaustion
came
from
dehydration,
not
from
walking,
and
there
was
spectators
at
that
event
who
were
passing
out.
they
weren't
doing
any
walking.
mr.
roy
l.
reardon
i,
i
think
the
abnormal
circumstance
would
probably
be
a
circumstance
that
may,
may
have
some
relationship
to
performance,
but
may
not.
