well,
mr.
farr--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--we
don't
have
to
decide
the
football
case
here,
but
i'm
wondering
if
you
take
too
narrow
a
view
of
what
the
pga's
business
it
is.
you
think
of
it
as
just
two
dimensional,
the
pga
wants
spectators,
both
public
and
on
the
television,
and
that's
the
service
involved.
but
the
other
thing,
as
justice
souter's
privilege
question
indicated,
it
also
offers
to
a
subset
of
the
public,
a
very
talented
subset
from
all
over
the
world,
the
opportunity
to
win
a
prize.
and
that's
also
part
of
its
business.
it
is
offering
an
opportunity
to
win
a
prize.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--we
are
talking
about
not
something
that's
just
a
place,
we
are
talking
about
the
tour,
the
circuit,
the
season,
whatever
it's
called.
that's
what
he
wants
to
participate
in.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
it
seems
to
me
is
a
public
accommodation
in
that
it's
open
to
golfers
from
all
over
the
world.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
assume
you
could
have
a
place
of
public
accommodation
on
a
cybernet
or
something
that
doesn't
exist
at
any
one
place,
and
that's
what,
that's
what
this
other
dimension
of
this
case
is.
they
are
offering
to
everyone
the
opportunity
to
compete
in
the
abstraction
we
call
a
tour,
a
circuit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what...
we
give
deference
to
agencies
all
the
time.
it's
not
rolling
over.
it's
just
an
acknowledgment
of
who
has
the
best
expertise,
who
knows
the
most
about
it,
who
is
best
equipped
to
make
the
decision.
that's
all
it
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's...
let's
assume
i
disagree
with
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
independent
contractor
repairman
has
to
do
it
for
a
living,
and
let's,
let's
assume
that
we
think
that
that's
what
these
golfers
are
doing.
what's
the
difference?
