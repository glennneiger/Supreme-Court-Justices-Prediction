mr.
eric
r.
fox
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
there
is
a
single
element
in
this
case
that
properly
determines
its
outcome,
and
that
is
that
the
product
liability
loss,
as
the
district
court
said,
and
you
can
find
this
on
page
36a
of
appendix
b.
the
product
liability
loss
is
a
subset
of
the
net
operating
loss.
section
172(a)
and
172(b)(1)(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
provides
that
a
net
operating
loss
can
be
carried
back
three
years.
section
172(b)(1)(i),
and
you
can
find
the
exact
language
on
page
two
of
petitioner's
brief,
provides
that
in
the
case
of
a
taxpayer
which
has
a
product
liability
loss,
the
product
liability
loss
shall
be
a
net
operating
loss
carry
back
to
each
of
the
ten
taxable
years
preceding
the
loss
year.
in
section
172(j)(1)
then
defines
the
term
product
liability
loss,
and
that
is,
it
is
the
lesser
of
the
net
operating
loss
for
the
year,
and
that
is
the
net
operating
loss
that
can
otherwise
be
carried
back
three
years,
or
the
sum
of
the
amounts
allowable
as
product
liability
deductions.
so
it
is
clear
that
the
product
liability
loss
is
nothing
other
than
a
piece
of
the
net
operating
loss.
and
if
you
apply
that
rule
to
a
single
stand
alone
corporation,
the
first
thing
you
do
is
determine
whether
the
corporation
has
a
net
operating
loss.
if
it
has
a
net
operating
loss,
the
next
thing
you
do
is
determine
the
extent
to
which
that
net
operating
loss
is
attributable
to
product
liability
deductions.
and
the
product
liability
deductions
in
an
amount
not
exceeding
the
net
operating
loss
then
becomes
the
product
liability
loss.
that
can
be
carried
back
ten
years,
but
it's
all
part
of
the
net
operating
loss.
so
if
you
have
a
product
liability
loss
that's
less
than
the
entire
net
operating
loss,
then
after
you
carry
back
the
product
liability
loss
ten
years,
what
is
left
of
the
net
operating
loss
can
be
carried
back
three
years.
the
important
part--
mr.
eric
r.
fox
--i
think
the
legislative
history
suggests
that
there
was
some
concern
that
product
liability
suits
and
the
like
took
time
to
arise,
and
that
a
product
might
be
sold
in
a
particular
year,
generate
income,
and
then
it
wouldn't
be
for
many
years
before
the
product
liability
suit
arose.
and
in
order
to
provide
a
longer
period
of
income
against
which
potentially
large
losses
might
be
deducted,
the
congress
thought
it
was
appropriate
to
extend
the
statute
and
allow
going
back
as
far
as
ten
years.
i
think
the
theory
was
that
it
would
be
logical
that
the
income
might
arise
years
earlier
than
the
three
year
period,
and
congress
was
simply
extending
the
carry
back
period
to
allow
for
that
problem.
mr.
eric
r.
fox
well--
mr.
eric
r.
fox
--well,
i'll
try,
justice
kennedy,
if
i
can.
i
believe
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
when
applied
to
an
affiliated
group
of
corporations
requires
the
outcome
that
we
seek.
mr.
eric
r.
fox
no.
justice
souter,
i
want
to
make
perfectly
clear
there
is
absolutely
no
double
deduction
in
this
case,
and
there
was
no
deduction
in
computing
separate
taxable
income
in
the
sense
that
a
tax
benefit
was
produced
at
that
point.
there
was
clearly
a
subtraction
of
the
product
liability
deduction
in
arriving
at
separate
taxable
income.
that
is--
mr.
eric
r.
fox
--incontrovertible.
mr.
eric
r.
fox
the
reason
is
that
when
you...
when
a
single
corporation
or
an
affiliated
group
has
a
net
operating
loss,
the
total
amount
of
that
loss
has
not
produced
any
tax
benefit
because
you
have
had
deductions
that
exceed
income,
and,
yes,
you've
deducted
them
in
the
sense
that
you
subtracted
them,
but
now
you
come
up
with
a
negative
number,
and
that
negative
number,
which
is
all
we're
talking
about
here...
the
net
operating
loss...
that
in
and
of
itself
does
not
produce
a
tax
benefit.
it's
just...
it's
hanging
out
there
until
you
can
carry
that
negative
number
to
some
other
year
and
take
a
deduction
against
income
in
that
other
year.
then
the
deduction
produces
a
tax
benefit,
so
we
have--
mr.
eric
r.
fox
--exactly,
justice
scalia.
that's
the
only
thing
we're
talking
about.
the
fact
is
that
the
very
same
product
liability
deductions
that
have
been,
quote,
deducted,
in
arriving
at
separate
taxable
income
are
in
the
net
operating
loss
that
respondent
will
agree
we
can
carry
back
three
years.
and
if
we
can
carry
it
back
three
years
and
take
a
deduction,
there's
no
double
deduction.
they
would
not
claim
that.
they
now
want
to
say
that
because
we're
going
back
ten
years,
there's
a
double
deduction,
but
that's
simply
not
the
case
because
we're
reducing
what
we
can
otherwise
take
back
three
years.
mr.
eric
r.
fox
all
we're
doing
is--
mr.
eric
r.
fox
--the
regulations
have
a
mechanism
for
dealing
with
corporations
that
join
a
group
and
provide
that
in
the
case
of
a
net
operating
loss,
if
a
member
of
the
group
contributes
to
the
net
operating
loss
by
itself
having
a
loss,
and
in
the
carry
back
year,
be
it
three
years
or
ten
years
earlier,
it
was
not
a
member
of
the
group,
a
portion
of
the
overall
net
operating
loss
can
be
allocated
to
that
company
and
carried
to
a
separate
return
year
outside
of
the
consolidated
return.
in
this
case--
mr.
eric
r.
fox
--must
be.
in
this
case
there...
the
corporations
that
generated...
the
members
of
the
group
that
generated
the
product
liability
deductions
would
not
have
an
allocated
net
operating
loss
under
that
provision
of
the
regulations
which
is
79.
and
so
there
is
no
mechanism
for
carrying
back
to
any
separate
return
year.
the
only
carry
back
can
be
within
the
group.
now,
if
you
have
a
corporation
that
joins
a
group
and
has
deductions,
even
though
it
just
joined
the
group,
any
deductions
it
has
are
going
to
find
its
way
into
the
net
operating
loss
that
can
be
carried
back.
so
the
question
again
is
the
fact
that
the
corporation
would
have
deductions,
even
though
it
had
separate
taxable
income.
the
fact
that
it
is
contributing
to
the
net
operating
loss,
even
though
it
wasn't
a
member,
say,
the
last
year,
does
not
prevent
its
deductions
from
being
carried
back
three
years
as
part
of
the
net
operating
loss.
and
so
in
this
case,
it's
merely
a
fact
that
they're
going
to
be
carried
back
ten
years
instead
of
three
years.
mr.
eric
r.
fox
exactly,
because
any
deductions
that
this
corporation
has
for
product
liability
are
going
to
find
their
way
into
the
net
operating
loss
that
can
be
carried
back
three
years,
and
that
would
be
before
it
was
a
member
of
the
group.
mr.
eric
r.
fox
well,
i
would
agree
with
you,
but
i
think--
mr.
eric
r.
fox
--yes.
mr.
eric
r.
fox
theoretically,
yes,
justice
breyer,
but
i
think
that
is
a...
that
the
example
which
comes
from
the
respondent's
brief
is
a
very
far
fetched
example.
number
one,
it
is
highly
unlikely
to
arise.
you
have
to
go
out
and
find
a
coincidence
of
facts
that
fit
just
perfectly,
number
one.
number
two
is
that
the
result
that
you
have
just
posited
is
not
something
that
flows
from
the
consolidated
return
regulations,
but
it
is
a
result
that
can
exist
if
a
single
stand
alone
corporation
were
to
find
itself
in
the
same
position,
it
could
go
out,
buy
another
corporation
if
the
facts
fit
perfectly,
liquidate
it,
and
do
exactly
the
same
thing.
mr.
eric
r.
fox
well--
mr.
eric
r.
fox
--that
may
not--
mr.
eric
r.
fox
--might
not
work
that
way
because
if,
first
of
all,
if
they
were
separately
profitable,
then
they
wouldn't
be
contributing
any
losses.
of
course,
if
they
had
losses,
then
they'd
have
to
carry
them
back
to
a
separate
return
year
of
their
own.
that's
why
i
find
that
this
hypothetical
requires
coincidences
that
are
very
unlikely
to
exist.
mr.
eric
r.
fox
not
really,
not
really.
not
the
example
that
is
in
respondent's
brief.
it
wouldn't
affect
that.
mr.
eric
r.
fox
i
would
say
you
owe
no
deference
whatsoever.
first
of
all,
i
noticed
as
i
was
walking
into
the
building
today
there
was
a
quotation
from
marbury
v.
madison
etched
into
the
wall
that
said
that
it
is
this
court's
obligation
to
decide
what
the
law
is.
but
moreover,
there
really
is
not
a
treasury
position
here.
there's
no...
they
have
never
promulgated
a
regulation,
they've
never
gone
through
the
hearing
process.
this
is
merely
some
lawyer
at
the
internal
revenue
service
taking
a
position
to
deal
with
a
situation
that
they
really
haven't
dealt
with
by
regulations.
mr.
eric
r.
fox
i
believe
it
would.
i
believe
they
would.
mr.
eric
r.
fox
no,
i
think
it
is
not
consistent
with
the
statute,
justice
kennedy.
i'll
tell
you
why.
mr.
eric
r.
fox
they
could
promulgate
a
regulation
that
would
be
consistent
with
this
statute
but
their
position,
given
the
regulations
as
they
exist
today,
is
inconsistent
with
the
statute,
and
i
will
tell
you
why.
the
reason
for
that
is,
as
i
said
earlier,
the
net...
the
product
liability
loss
is
just
a
piece
of
the
net
operating
loss,
and
an
affiliated
group
filing
a
consolidated
return
has
only
one
net
operating
loss...
the
consolidated
operating
loss.
that's
the
only
thing
that
exists
to
be
carried
back
three
years.
now,
just
as
you
would
in
the
case
of
the
separate
corporation,
you
say,
to
what
extent
is
that
consolidated
net
operating
loss
the
only
thing
that
they
had
prescribed
that
can
be
carried
back
three
years?
to
what
extent
is
it
attributable
to
product
liability
deductions?
and
you
can
determine
that
by
looking
at
all
of
the
product
liability
deductions
of
the
group.
it's
right
in
there
and
every
one
of
those
deductions,
regardless
of
whether
the
contributing
member
has
negative
taxable
income
or
positive
taxable
income,
goes
right
to
that
bottom
line,
and
you
can
prove,
dollar
for
dollar,
that
the
net
operating
loss
is
attributable
to
every
one
of
those
deductions.
and
that,
because
of
the
way
they
have
designed
the
regulations,
they
have
provided
only
for
the
single
consolidated
net
operating
loss.
that
is
what
could
be
carried
back
three
years,
that's
what
a
piece
of
can
be
carried
back
ten
years.
and
there's
no
getting
around
that
fact.
and
you
don't
need
a
regulation
to
say,
let's
do
it
on
a
consolidated
basis.
you
really
don't
have
to
worry
about
whether
we
should
view,
in
this
particular
case,
the
consolidated
group
as
a
single
entity
or
as
a
group
of
separate
companies.
mr.
eric
r.
fox
i'm
a
little
confused
as
to
what
position
the
government
is
taking
in
this
case,
but
in
the
court
of
appeals
they
basically
argued
that
the
net
operating
loss
you
should
look
at
was
the
negative
or
positive
separate
taxable
income
of
a
company.
that
if
you
had
positive
taxable
income,
then
the
member
didn't
have
a
net
operating
loss
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
matter.
the
fourth
circuit
rejected
that
argument.
the
fourth
circuit
said,
as
the
petitioner
argued,
that
the
definition
of
separate
taxable
income
is
not
the
same
as
the
definition
of
a
net
operating
loss
because
separate
taxable
income
excludes
things
like
charitable
contributions,
capital
gains
and
the
like.
and
so
negative
taxable
income
can
never
equate
theoretically,
and
definitionally,
with
a
net
operating
loss.
and
so
the
fourth
circuit
went
and
found
a
net
operating
loss
some
place
else.
mr.
eric
r.
fox
justice
ginsburg,
they
found
it
in
the
regulation
79.
mr.
eric
r.
fox
i
don't
recall
it
being
in
the
government's
brief
but
the
government
from
time
to
time
has
put
out
technical
advice
memoranda
and
the
like,
and
that
argument
had
been
raised
by
the
government,
but
i
do
not
recall
them
arguing
it
specifically
in
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
eric
r.
fox
well,
i
think
from
a
policy
standpoint
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
the
1918
legislative
history,
that
certainly
when
congress
brought
the
consolidated
return
into
being,
they
thought
of
the
affiliated
group
as
one
single
business.
the
respondent
wants
to
treat
every
corporation
as
a
separate
business.
well,
that's
clearly
contrary
to
what
congress
thought.
and
it
may
be
that
you
have
situations
where
you
can
have
an
affiliated
group
with
corporations
in
what
we
would
call
different
lines
of
business,
but
that's
not
what
congress
was
talking
about.
they
thought
that
all
of
the
activity...
business
activity
under
common
ownership,
was
a
single
business.
but
even
then
you
could
have
an
affiliated
group
of
five
thousand
coffee
shops,
or
five
thousand
vitamin
stores,
all
managed
by
a
separate
headquarters
business...
all
financed
out
of
one
separate
headquarters
business.
i
think
it's
pretty
hard
there
to
view
each
separately
incorporated
coffee
shop
as
a
business
that's
separate
and
apart
from
every
other
business.
and
in
that
case,
it
would
make
perfectly
sense...
perfect
sense
if
one
member
of
the
group
had
a
product
liability
loss,
even
though
it
might
otherwise
be
profitable,
that
this
entire
group
which
is
all
in
the
identical
line
of
business
should
be
able
to
avail
itself
of
that.
mr.
eric
r.
fox
if
that
corporation
were
a
stand
alone
corporation,
i
would
say
yes
it
is.
but
i
think
when
you're
dealing
with
an
affiliated
group,
that
puts
too
much
emphasis
on
where
you
place
the
particular
business.
i
mean,
a
good
tax
planner,
if
they
thought
this
was
a
problem,
could
get
around
that
by
simply
moving
loss
companies
around.
and
if
you
take
a
loss
company
and
put
it
where
you're
going
to
have
the
product
liability
deductions,
you
probably
could
straighten
that
problem
out.
mr.
eric
r.
fox
it
is
theoretically
possible,
but
i
would
say
that
if
that
highly
unlikely
scenario...
i
mean,
you
might
have
to
face
up
to
the
possibility
of
going
out
and
buying
a
tobacco
company
and
you
think,
well,
it'll
throw
off
some
product
liability
deductions,
but
you
have
no
idea
the
extent
of
that.
you're
kind
of
risking
your
entire
company
on
some
tax
dodge.
mr.
eric
r.
fox
well,
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
that
that
is
not
really
a
function
of
consolidated
returns.
take
a
single
stand
alone
corporation
that
has
an
oil
business
and
a
computer
business.
now,
they
might
have
a
product
liability
in
the
oil
business,
but
when
they
report
their
income,
they
are
reporting
the
entire
company's
income
and
losses.
and
if
there
is
a
profit
in
the
oil
business
with
a
product
liability
deduction
and
a
huge
loss
in
the
computer
business,
they
put
that
all
together
and,
even
though
the
oil
business
was
profitable
and
the
product
liability
was
more
than
offset
by
the
oil
company's
income,
because
they
are
in
a
separate
corporation,
they
can
put
everything
together
and
they're
going
to
get
the
product
liability
deduction.
so
the
fact
that
you
have
disparate
lines
of
business
is
not
the
thing
that
causes
the
problem,
because
you
can
get
exactly
the
same
result
when
you're
dealing
with
a
stand
alone
corporation.
and
if
that's
not
a
problem
there,
i
don't
really
see
why
it
should
be
a
problem
in
the
affiliated
group
context.
mr.
eric
r.
fox
yes,
i
think
that
is
exactly
the
case.
that's
the
way
congress
viewed
an
affiliated
group
if
you
look
at
that
1918
legislative
history.
they
say
exactly
that
at
some
length.
and
i
think,
furthermore,
that
my
ultimate
point
here
is
that
the
plain
language
of
this
statute
requires
that
you
look
at
the
consolidated
net
operating
loss...
that's
the
only
thing
we
have
that's
a
net
operating
loss,
and
you
ask,
to
what
extent
is
that
net
operating
loss
attributable
to
product
liability
deductions.
we
have
in
the
general
explanation
of
the
revenue
bill
of
1978
which
is
cited
on
page
4
and
21
of
our
brief.
this
provision
was
explained
this
way.
under
the
act,
the
amount
of
a
net
operating
loss
that
is
attributable
to
a
product
liability
loss
can
be
carried
back
an
additional
seven
years
is
only
one
net
operating
loss
this
affiliated
this
group
has,
the
consolidated
net
operating
loss.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
requires
you
to
ask
only
one
question,
to
what
extent
is
that
net
operating
loss
attributable
to
product
liability
deductions?
and
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
you
don't
need
any
special
regulation.
to
the
extent
you're
a
little
worried
about
this
hypothetical,
number
one,
the
government
can
correct
that
by
regulations.
they
already
have
a
provision
in
the
code,
section
269,
that
allows
them
to
set
aside
deductions
in
the
case
of
acquisitions
made
for
tax
avoidance.
so
i
don't
believe
that
we
should
let
that
little
tail,
if
you
will,
wag
this
dog.
that's
a
very
small
point,
purely
hypothetical,
it
can
be
dealt
with
by
regulations.
it
can
be
dealt
with
by
section
269.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
would
appreciate
reserving
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
eric
r.
fox
thank
you.
mr.
eric
r.
fox
the
respondent
takes
the
position
that
if
the
regulations
do
not
address
a
particular
provision,
that
any
provision
in
the
code
has
to
be
applied
on
a
separate
company
basis
and
not
on
a
consolidated
basis.
that
is
totally
inconsistent
with
the
position
that
the
internal
revenue
service
took
in
both
gottesman
and
h
enterprises.
in
the
gottesman
case,
the
irs
argued
that
the
accumulated
earnings
tax
had
to
be
applied
on
a
single
entity
basis.
they
happened
to
lose
that
case,
but
that
was
their
position.
in
h
enterprises,
they
took
the
position
that
the
disallowance
of
interest
rule
had
to
be
applied
on
a
consolidated
basis,
and
they
won
the
case.
what
happened
in
that
case
was
the
taxpayer
argued
that
they
had
borrowing
in
one
company,
and
the
tax
exempt
bonds
in
another
company,
and
that
you
shouldn't
look
at
the
two
together.
but
h
enterprises
is...
clearly
provides
that
you
look
at
the
whole
thing
as
one,
and
there
was
no
regulation
that
said
that.
the
other
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
the
government
seems
to
think
that
you
can
kind
of
have
a...
it's
not
very
important
as
to
how
close
the
definition
of
separate
taxable
income
may
come
to
net
operating
loss.
i
think
that
is,
in
a
sense,
totally
irrelevant
because
the
statute
says,
you
look
at
the
net
operating
loss.
the
regulations
have
provided
for
a
net
operating
loss.
it's
the
consolidated
net
operating
loss.
i
see
no
reason
why
it
would
even
look
at
separate
taxable
income.
the
question
is,
we
have
the
regulations
provision
for
the
separate
net
operating
loss,
and
the
issue
is,
to
what
degree
does
that
net
operating
loss
that
everyone
agrees
can
be
carried
back
three
years...
to
what
extent
is
it
attributable
to
product
liability
deductions?
when
we
come
up
with
the
number,
that's
the
product
liability
loss.
and
that's
the
end
of
the
matter,
and
you
don't
need
a
regulation
to
tell
you
to
get
there,
because
the
statute
is
clear
on
its
face,
and
the
service
has
put
in
the
regulation
the
definition
of
net
operating
loss.
thank
you.
