what
we're
arguing
about
here
is
whether
you
go
back
three
years
or
ten
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
be
or
must
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
the
same
problem
exists
under
the
three
year
carry
back?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
for
that
matter,
it
would
apply
within
the
three
year
period
if
it's
just
seeking
a
three
year
carry
back,
no?
although
i
guess
it
wouldn't
matter
if
it's
product
liability
carry
back
or
not.
but
that
can
happen
under
the
three
year
carry
back,
can't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
can't
you
purchase
somebody
with
losses
that
will
enable
you
to
carry
back
what
you
otherwise
wouldn't
be
able
to
carry
back
three
years?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
fox,
did
the
government
take
the
same
position
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
takes
here?
i
thought
it
argued
for
something
a
bit
different
from
what
the
court
of
appeals
came
up
with.
justice
antonin
scalia
except...
except
in
the
case
where
you
have
a
company
that's
acquired
between
three
and
ten
years.
in
that
case,
you
always
will
end
up
with
a
profitable
company
acquired
between
the
three
and
the
ten
years.
you
will
always
have
the
anomaly.
that
company
will
have
taken,
as
a
deduction
from
its
income,
its
product
liability
loss,
and
its
taxes
will
have
been
reduced
accordingly,
right?
and
then...
and
then
the
consolidated
company
will
be
able
to
go
back
ten
years
and
use
some
of
its
deductions
once
again,
in
that
one
situation
where
you
have
the
acquisition
of
a
profitable
country...
company
between
three
and
ten
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
the
whole
tax?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
can
get
the
whole
thing
out
of
any
one
of
them,
not
just
the
aliquot
portion
attributable
to
that
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
indeed
you
wouldn't
know
what
the
aliquot
portion
would
be.
what
about
the
problem
that
there
is
simply
no
net
operating
loss
for
each
of
the
individual
companies?
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
go
further,
aren't
there
some
exceptions
from
normal--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
mean,
capital--
justice
antonin
scalia
--charitable
deductions?
capital
losses?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
can
never
really
come
up
with
a
really
genuine
picture
of
what
the
individual--
justice
antonin
scalia
--net
operating
loss,
if
there
were
such
a
thing,
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jones,
what
is
the
principal
purpose
of
part
12
of
the
regs?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
isn't
designed
specifically
for
this
situation.
for
what
other
purpose
do
you
need
a
definition
of
separate
taxable
income?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
do
you
think
that...
what
i
find
persuasive
in
the
taxpayer's
case
here
is
the
fact
that
net
operating
loss
is
only...
it's
not
defined
in
the
regs,
it's
only
defined
in
the
statute,
and
it
is
defined
to...
in
a
way
that
would
only
apply
to
the
consolidated
return
and
not
in
a
way
that
could
apply
to
the
separate
returns.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
the
only
horrible
you've
presented...
that...
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
case
where
that
is
the
principal
purpose.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
you
complain
when
we
say
there's
a
solution
for
that
horrible
by
saying,
well,
but
then
we'd
have
to
prove
that
it
was
the
principal
purpose.
of
course
you
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
horrible
unless
that's
the
principal
purpose.
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
are
the
other
examples
you
were
about
to
give?
other
instances
in
which
it's
important
to
figure
out
the
separate
taxable
income
of--
