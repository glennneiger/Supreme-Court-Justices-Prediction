is
the
theory
of
the
statute
that
development
of
these
products
usually
takes
longer
than
a
three
year
period,
and
that
what
we're
just
trying
to
do
is
allow
the
company
to
have
its
loss
carry
back
apply
to
those
years
in
which
it
was
engaging
in
research?
is
that
the
theory
of
the
statute,
or
is
there
some
other
theory?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
it
doesn't
help
us
much
because
if
i
told
you,
well,
that
makes
it
sound
very
corporation
specific,
you
would
say,
well,
so
are
all
other
net
operating
losses
when
they're
calculated.
in
the
first
instance,
they're
specific
to
that
corporation,
and
yet
they
are
carried
over
to
affiliated
groups,
so
product
liability
losses
should
be
given
the
same
treatment.
i
take
it
that's
your
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
want
to
make
it
a
better
argument,
huh?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
would
the
government
have
the
authority
to
promulgate
a
regulation
which
reaches
the
result
that
the
chief
seeks
to
reach
here--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so,
so
then
it
follows
from
that,
that
the
government's
position
is
consistent
with
the
statute,
if
that's
true.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
can
promulgate
a
regulation
that's
inconsistent
with
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
why
couldn't
you
say
that
with
reference
to
any
operating
loss?
i
thought
most
of
the
code
was
addressed
to
a
single
taxpayer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
except
i
think
it
does.
if,
for
instance,
for
legal
expense,
the
corporation
has
had
to
have
hired
a
lawyer
and
deduct
a
legal
expense
for
something
that
was
a
medical
expense.
i
don't
understand--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--your
response.
do
you
see
my
problem?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
your
answer
was
that
the
expense
has
to
be
related
to
the
reason
for
which
it
was
incurred,
and
i
say,
well,
that's
true
of
any
expense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
that's
also
true
with
all
deductions.
i
can't
take
a
legal
expense
for
something
that
is
on
my
son's
separate
return.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
agree,
but
the
fact
that
an
entity
that
incurred
the
expense
is
different
from
the
entity
taking
it...
presents
the
same
problem
as
with
any
other
deduction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
have
authority
under
269
to
disallow
losses
if
the
company
is
acquired
for
purposes
of
tax
avoidance,
or
would--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
if
i
went
out
to
acquire
a
corporation
just
to
take
advantage
of
this
loss,
you
could
invoke
269?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
that
was
the
assumption
of
justice
breyer's
question.
of
course,
you'd
have
to
litigate
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
not
powerless.
