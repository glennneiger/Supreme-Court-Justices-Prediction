mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i
think
it's
common
ground
that
none
of
the
corporations
involved
in
this
case
would
be
able
to
claim
a
product
liability
loss
on
a
separate
return.
that's
because
the
product
liability
loss
provisions
provide
no
extended
carry
back
benefits
either
for
profitable
corporations
regardless
of
the
amount
of
their
product
liability
expenses,
or
for
unprofitable
corporations
that
have
no
such
expenses.
so
the
narrow
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
fact
that
this
profitable
entity
that
had
some
expenses
of
this
type
is
combined
with
an
unprofitable
entity
that
had
no
such
expenses
changes
the
result
on
a
consolidated
return.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
taxpayer
in
the
172
context
is
plainly
the
individual
corporation.
that's
the
way
that
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
code
are
written.
they
are
written
to
apply
to
the
individual
taxpayer.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
only--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--each
of
these
corporations
is
a
taxpayer.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
only
way
that
they
avoid
filing
a
separate
return
is
by
electing
under
1.1502
to
file
a
consolidated
return.
and
so
the
question
is,
how
do
you
go
from
the
provisions
of
the
code
that
dictate
how
we
treat--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--separate
taxpayers.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
each
of
them
is
severally
liable,
and
so
the
answer--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
i
don't
know.
the
answer
can
vary.
sometimes
a
check
can
be
drawn
from
each
of
the
corporations
or
by
any
one
of
them.
they
are
severally
liable
for
this
tax.
that
is
to
say
each
of
them
is
liable
for
the
consolidated
tax.
to
understand
how--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes,
sir.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
correct.
that's
section
6--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
that's...
that's
really...
the
entire
thrust
of
their
argument
is
that
if
you
start
in
a
consolidated...
from
a...
let
me
answer
the
question
with
a
little
bit
of
background.
i
don't
want
to
avoid
your
question,
but
i
think
a
little
bit
of
background
would
be
helpful.
to
answer
that
question,
you
have
to
understand
what
is
the
background
principle
that
applies
in
consolidated
returns.
since
the
woolford
realty
case,
the
background
principle
has
clearly
been
that
notwithstanding
the
consolidation,
you
treat
each
of
the
corporations
as
a
separate
tax
paying
entity
except
as
the
regulations
provide
for
consolidated
treatment.
so
then
you
have
to
go
to
the
regulations
to
see
how
the
regulations
provide
for
the
consolidated
treatment.
section
12
of
the
reg
says
that
in
determining
consolidated
income,
the
first
step
is
to
determine
the
separate
income
of
each
corporation
based
upon
the
rules
that
apply
to
the
determination
of
taxes
for
separate
tax
paying
entities.
under
that
regulation,
it's
undisputed
that
the
product
liability
expenses
of
each
of
these
corporations
are
deducted
from
the
income
of
each
of
these
corporations,
and--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there
are
some
exceptions
of
items--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that's
right,
that
under
the
regulations
are
treated
as
consolidated
items
and
aren't
part
of
the
calculation
of
separate
taxable
income.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
you
don't--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
term
separate
taxable
income
is
not
a
perfect
equivalent.
they
say,
well,
we
want
a
perfect
equivalent
to
net
operating
loss
that
we'd
calculate
for
an
individual
taxpayer,
and
there
are
three
reasons
why
that
objection
has
no
force.
the
first
is
a
simple
practical
one.
they
don't
contend
that
under
any
definition
of
separate
net
operating
loss
they
would
have
had
a
loss.
each
of
these
companies
was
profitable.
they're
claiming
the
rights
of
a
hypothetical
taxpayer
that,
in
fact,
in
the
twenty
three
year
history
of
this
provision
has
never
existed.
there
has
never
been
a
taxpayer
with
product
liability
expenses
who
had
a
positive
separate
taxable
income
but
a
negative
separate
net
operating
loss.
that
has
just
never
happened.
and
that's
why,
in
the
twenty
three
years,
there's
never
been
any
reason
for
the
secretary
to
adopt
a
discrete
regulation
designed
to
address
these
minor
differences
because
they
have
never
been
a
practical
issue.
and
that
brings
me
to
my
third
point
which
is
there
is
no
requirement
that
there
be
a
perfectly
equivalent
treatment
between
individual
taxpayers
and
the
consolidated
taxpayer.
if
that
was
a
requirement,
we
wouldn't
have
consolidated
returns.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
a
consolidated
return.
if
they
had
to
be
perfectly
equal,
we
wouldn't
have
consolidated
returns,
we'd
just
have
separate
taxpayers
calculating
their
taxes
and
we'd
add
them
up.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
that
the
service
has
taken
a
consistent
position
in
litigation,
and
as
far
as
what
happened
in
the
negotiations
between
the
parties,
i
mean,
it's
often
the
case
that
people
try
to
work
things
out.
but
we're
in
litigation
here.
we're
trying
to
decide
how
the
law
applies.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
consistent
position
that
we're
taking
is
that
separate
taxable
income
is
a
workable
rule
that
applies
in
this
context,
and
that's
the
point
i
was
about
to
make
which
is
that
section
1502
of
the
regs...
i'm
sorry,
of
the
statute...
doesn't
tell
the
secretary
adopt
rules
that
are
perfectly
equal.
it
says
adopt
rules
for
consolidation
that
achieve
a
clear--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that's
not
the
fourth...
the
fourth
circuit
had
a
different
perspective.
i'm
trying
to
describe
to
you
what
the
government's
position
is.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's
a
complicated...
the
answer
to
that
is
very
complicated.
the
answer
to
that
is,
that
that
reg
that
the
fourth
circuit
relied
on
does
sometimes
apply
in
these
cases.
it
applied
in
the
amtel
case
which
was
the
first
case
the
petitioners
brought
to
challenge
this
tax
issue.
it
applied
there
because
there
was
a
separate
return
year
for
some
of
these
subsidiaries.
and
when
the
separate
return
years
were
involved,
then
you
use
the
separate
net
operating
loss
definition
that's
contained
in
the
79
reg.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
they
were--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that's
correct.
they
were.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
they
were
saying
this
is
a
rule--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--they
were
saying
this
is
an...
i
think
what
they
were
saying
is
this
is
an
appropriate
rule
to
apply
by
analogy.
and
we
don't
disagree
with
that.
what
we're
trying
to
explain
is
how
the
rules
we
have
in
place
work.
we
don't
disagree
with
the
fourth
circuit
that
we
could
apply
their
rule
by
analogy.
we
don't
disagree
that
in
a...
if
a
situation...
let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
there
ever
were
the
hypothetical
situation
in
which
some
taxpayer
came
in
and
said,
well,
i
have
had
positive
separate
taxable
income,
but
i
actually
had
a
negative...
a
separate
net
operating
loss
as
defined
in
reg
79,
we
think
that
might
well
be
a
reasonable
resolution.
but
it
is
not
the
resolution
that's
currently
in
the
reg.
the
resolution
that's
currently
in
the
reg
is
valid,
though,
because
it
is
a
legislative
rule
adopted
by
the
secretary
under
section
1502.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
sir.
it's
resolved
by
section
12
of
the
regulations
which
require
the
separate
taxable
income
to
be
calculated
by
reducing
from
each
taxpayer's
income
the
product
liability
expenses
it
incurred.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
rationale
of
the
reg
79
rule
is
a
workable
rule
that
would
make
sense
if
such
a
situation
ever
arose,
and
we
don't
disagree
with
that.
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
legislative
rules
that
the
secretary,
in
fact,
has
adopted
under
his
broad
authority
to
adopt
rules
that
reasonably
reflect
the
income
and
avoid
the
evasion
of
taxes...
the
rules
that
we
have
are
workable
rules,
and
the
proof
is
in
the
pudding
that
in
twenty
three
years
they
have
never
not
aptly
applied.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
section
1502
gives
us
the
authority
to
adopt
reg
12.
that's
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
reg
12--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--provides
a
workable
rule--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes,
sir.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
if
the...
if
the
opponent
agreed
with
us,
we
wouldn't
of
course
be
here.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
we've
won
this
in
some
courts,
we've
lost
it
in
other
courts.
there's
a
conflict,
which
is
why
we're
here.
and
what
i'm
trying
to
make
clear
is
we
don't...
we're
not
saying
we
disagree
with
the
analysis
of
the
fourth
circuit--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--we're
saying
that
the
analysis
of
the
fourth--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes,
the
fourth
circuit
thought
that
the
rules
were
perfectly
equivalent.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
have
not
argued...
i
have
not
suggested
to
the
contrary,
and
what
i've
said
is
that
what
we...
we
agree
with
the
fourth
circuit
that
if
a
situation
ever
arose
where
this
hypothetical
distinction
between
separate
taxable
income
and
separate
net
operating
loss
ever
came
up,
which
it
never
has,
the
rule
adopted
by
the
fourth
circuit
might
well
be
sensible.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
is
a
proper
resolution
of
this
case.
it...
it
answers
questions
that
the
court
doesn't
need
to
answer.
it
answers
the
question
of
what
would
happen
if
these...
if
this
factual
situation
arose
that
never
had.
and
what
we're
saying
is
that
in
that
hypothetical
situation,
that's
a
good
answer,
but
what
we're
also
saying
is
that
the
secretary
is
the
one
who
is
supposed
to
adopt
these
legislative
rules,
and
we
don't
think
that
the
court
needs
to,
and
therefore
shouldn't
reach
out--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
is...
it
is
the
resolution
of
this
case
that
we
think
is
appropriate
on
the
facts...
on
the
hypothetical
facts
that
the
court
used
in
fashioning
that
rule,
but
i
would
simply
repeat
myself
in
saying
that
it's
up
to
the
secretary
to
fashion
these
legislative
rules.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
there
is.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
what
it
is
is,
it's
the
process
of
the
calculations
required
by
the
regulations,
and
that
is
that
you've
deducted...
you've
taken
the
deduction
of
the
product
liability
expenses
at
the
separate
affiliate
level--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--they
have
not
had
losses,
they
have
had
profits.
those
deductions
have
been
used
at
that
level
and
cannot
go
to
the
consolidated
level.
there
are
no
deductions
to
take
to
the
consolidated
level
to
change
the
character
of
the
losses
of
the
unprofitable
affiliates
from
the
ordinary
losses
for
which
they
get
three
years
into
these
extended
benefit
losses
for
ten
years.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
wording
that
controls
this
is
the
wording
of
section
12
of
the
reg
that
says
in
determining
the...
separate
income
of
each
affiliate,
the
first
thing
you
do
is
you
apply
the
rules
that
govern
the
determination
of
income--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--okay.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
it's
because
congress
adopted
in
172
a
product
liability
loss...
that
provision
which
is
not
a
subset
of
losses,
it's
a
subset
of
the
losses
incurred
by
the
company
that
incur
the
product
liability
expenses.
what
they
are
doing
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--most
of
the
code
doesn't
turn
the
character
of
the
allowance
on
the
character
of
the
expense.
congress
in
172(j)
focused
this
special
allowance
on
the
taxpayer,
in
the
words
of
the
history,
that
suffered
the
loss.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
only--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
i
probably
don't
understand
your
question,
because
what
i
thought
you
were
saying
is
what's
special
about
product
liability
expenses
that
they
should
be
locused...
focused--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
has
to
be
related
to
the
taxpayer
that
incurred
it.
it
has
to
be
related
to
the
entity
that
incurred
it...
not
to
some
other
entity.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
right,
but
if,
in
a
consolidated
context,
if
you
consolidate
somebody's
profit
and
somebody
else's
loss,
you
get
a
consolidated
loss,
hypothetically,
which
ordinarily
you
get
a
three
year
carry
back
for.
the
question
is
whether
this
specific
situation
justifies
characterizing
that
consolidated
loss
as
a
product
liability
loss
or
for
some--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
doesn't
present
a
problem
unless
they're
trying
to
get
this
special
carry
back,
and
they
only
get
the
special
carry
back
when
this
special
type
of
deduction
causes
a
loss
for
the
company
that
incurred
this
deduction.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
purpose--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
is
a
very
important
provision,
because
so
many
of
the
provisions
of
the
code,
or...
not
maybe
so
many...
but
many
of
the
provisions
of
the
code,
the
ability
of
a
company
to
use
them
turns
on
the
specific
facts
of
that
company.
there
are
two
other
cases
that
we've
cited
to
you
in
our
brief,
the
h
enterprises
case
and
the
first
chicago
case,
both
of
which
involve
situations
where
a
deduction
was
available
only
because
of
the
characteristics
of
that
individual
company.
and
this
relates
to
the
background
rule
that
i
described
to
you
from
the
woolford
realty
case.
you
have
to...
it's
necessary
to
understand
that
the
consolidated
regulations
are
an
overlay.
you
start
with
the
separate
taxable...
as
separate
applications
and
returns
to
each
individual
entity,
and
then
you
only
consolidate
to
the
extent
the
regs
provide.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
consolidated
net
operating
loss
is
only
defined
in
that
way,
but
the
operating
losses
of
the
individual
entities
are
defined
both
in
the
separate
taxable
income
context
which
can
be
negative,
the
regulations--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--there
is
no
question
that
the
secretary
can
adopt...
could
adopt
a
rule
that
did
that,
but
let
me
point
out
what
would
happen
then.
the
secretary
would
then
no
longer
be
able
to
provide
for
consolidated
treatment
of
the
numerous
items
that
they've
done...
like
charitable
deductions
and
so
forth.
if
we're
going
to
have
a
separate
net
operating
loss
definition
for
individual
corporations,
it
would
have
to
be
only
for
this
issue,
and
then
it
would
have
to
take
account
of,
well,
we're
no
longer
treating
these
as
consolidated
on
the
other...
on
the
consolidated
return.
we
would
have
to
make
some
adjustments
there,
too.
what
the
secretary
instead
has
done
is
he
has
a
workable
rule.
it
has
the
background
rule
that
determines
taxes
at
each
individual
affiliate.
because
none
of
these
affiliates
have
losses...
none
of
them
have
product
liability
losses
to
pass
on
to
the
consolidated
level.
petitioner's
theory
would
just
recharacterize
what
is
a
normal
loss
for
its
other
companies
into
some
kind
of
special
product
liability
loss.
now,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
because
it
is
very
important
to
us
that
petitioner's
theory
in
this
case
would
lead
to
serious
opportunities
for
manipulation
and
abuse.
for
example,
the
hypothetical
that's
already
been
described
to
the
court...
you
have
a
long
history
of
profits
and
a
current
history
of
losses,
but
you
don't
have
product
liability
expenses.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
the
statute
says
for
the
principal
purpose
of
avoiding
taxes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
would...
we
would
have
to
litigate
whether
we...
we
would
have
to
establish
that
was
your
principal
purpose,
and
i
suspect
you'd
say,
well,
you
had
a
legitimate
business
purpose.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
we
would
have
to
litigate
it,
and
we
would
be--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--doing
it
in
the
face
of
taxpayers
who
were
obviously
planning--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
the
other--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
don't
mean
to
say
it's
a
horrible--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
think
that
the
other--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
other
horrible
is
that
congress
didn't
intend
this
to
happen.
congress
provided
no
product
liability
loss
benefits
for
profitable
companies,
regardless
of
the
amount
of
expenses
they've
incurred.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
that
doesn't
accomplish
their
objective,
because
then
the
acquiring
company
would
be
liable
for
all
these
product
liability
expenses.
they'd
be
a
single
company,
and
we
wouldn't
object
then.
we
wouldn't
have
an
objection
to
that
because
then
they
would
be
incurring
the
product
liability
expenses
as
they
incurred.
now,
historically
for
the
expenses
incurred
prior
to
the
date
of
the
merger,
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
use
that.
they'd
have
to
have
some
other
theory.
but
after
the
merger,
that's
not
a
problem.
the
problem
is
that
this
is
like
woolford.
this
is
a
case
where
they
are
coming
up
with
a
strategy
to
avoid
the
payment
of
taxes,
and
even
though
counselor
says
this
is
an
unlikely
situation--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that
is
this
situation.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
but
the
question
is
whether
the
consolidated
provisions
permit
it,
and
in
woolford
realty
the
court
said
that
the
mind
rebels
against
the
notion
that
in
allowing
for
consolidated
returns
congress
meant
to
provide
for
such
a
facile
and
obvious
means
of
juggling
tax
attributes
to
avoid
the
payment
of
taxes.
that's
what
we
have...
we
have
a
facile
and
obvious
method
of
juggling
tax
attributes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's
a
single
corporation.
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
because
the...
what
congress
was
concerned
about
was
the
company
who
was
liable
for
the...
whether
the
company
that
was
liable
for
the
product
liability
expenses
had
been
fairly
treated,
and
if
that
company
is
a
single
entity,
then
it
has
received
the
income
in
the
past,
it
has
paid
taxes
on
that
income,
and
then
when
the
deductions
come
up
ten
years
later
because
the
expenses
come
up
later,
it's
fair
to
let
that
company
go
back
and
get
the
monies
that
they've
paid
in
taxes
back
ten
years
ago.
it
is
not
fair,
and
it's
not
what
congress
provided,
to
let
some
other
company
that
had
no
product
liability
expenses
go
back
and
get
their
taxes
back
from
ten
years.
that's
not
what
172
is
about.
that's
not
what
the
consolidated
tax
return
provisions
are
about.
that's
not
what
this
court
or
congress
intended
to
sanction.
this
court
said
in
woolford
realty
that
this
sort
of
juggling
is
not
to
happen,
and
in
section
1502,
congress
said
that
the
privilege
of
filing
a
consolidated
return
is
not
to
be
used
as
a
license
for
evading
taxes.
that's
what
we
have
at
issue
here.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
intermet,
the
sixth
circuit
got
this
issue
wrong
principally
by
relying
on
section
80
of
the
regulations
which
the
court
said
creates
a
default
rule
under
which
you
are
supposed
to
apply
tax
provisions
first
at
the
consolidated
level,
unless
a
regulation
otherwise
provides.
that's
a
hundred
and
eighty
degrees
off.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
that
was
also
well
off
the
point,
the
locus
of
the
income
at
the
individual
corporate
level
is
often
important...
it's
often
critical...
in
determining
the
proper
tax
treatment
of
that
item.
this
case
is
just
one
more
example
of
that.
for
example--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
actually
what
affects
the
income
of
the
consolidated
group
is
the
positive
taxable
income
that
comes
from
that
affiliate.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
positive
taxable
income
goes
over
and
reduces
the
losses
of
the
other
companies.
the
sixth
circuit
just
got
this
wrong,
and
they
thought
that
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--h
enterprises
is
a
good
example.
we
cited
this
in
our
brief.
h
enterprises
involved
a
company...
two
affiliates,
one
of
which
bought
some
stock
and
the
other,
which
borrowed
some
money
and
transferred
it
to
its
affiliate.
and
the
affiliate
used
that
money
to
buy
the
stock.
now,
there's
a
limitation
on
the
amount
of
interest
that
can
be
deducted
for
this
kind
of
equity
acquisition,
and
the
question
was,
well,
do
you
combine
these
two,
or
do
you
look
at
their
separate
character?
and
the
answer
of
the
tax
court
in
h
enterprises
was,
no,
you
have
to
look
at
them
as
separate
individuals
and
apply
that
provision
separately
first.
now,
another...
and
so
the
result
was
that,
well,
you
didn't
hold
the
interest...
the
company
that
borrowed
the
money
subject
to
this
limitation
of
using
that,
that
when
the
other
company
used
the
money
to
buy
stock.
the
other
example
is...
is
the
first
chicago
bank
case
which
we've
cited
where
the
question
is,
well,
can
a
company
claim
a
dividends
received
deduction?
it
can
only
do
that
if
it
holds
a
certain
percentage
of
the
stock
of
the
company.
one
affiliate
owned
less
than
that
amount,
and
another
affiliate
owned
less
than
that
amount,
but
when
you
combine
them,
they
both
own
more
than
that
amount.
but
because
you
local...
you
focus
your
inquiry
first
on
each
separate
company,
neither
of
those
companies
qualified
for
the
dividends
received
deduction
because
neither
of
them
individually
met
the
requirement.
when
congress
has
wanted
to
provide
for
consolidated
treatment
of
loss
items,
they've
done
so
expressly.
in
172(h),
congress
provides
a
loss
limitation
on
certain
kinds
of
interest
incurred
in
connection
with
equity
acquisitions
and
expressly
stated
that
when
this
provision
applies
to
a
corporation
that
is
a
member
of
an
affiliated
group,
it
is
to
be
applied
to
the
affiliated
group
directly.
congress
made
no
such
consolidation...
required
no
such
consolidated
treatment
for
product
liability
losses
that
are
described
only
a
few
paragraphs
away.
the
implication
of
this
seems
to
be
pretty
clear...
that
congress
recognizes
the
background
rule
that
this
court
described
in
woolford
realty,
which
is,
you
look
at
each
of
these
companies
as
individual
entities
first,
unless
a
regulation
provides
separately.
that's
why
i
was
focusing
on
how
the
regulations
tell
us
what
to
do.
the
regulations
tell
us
take
these
deductions
at
the
individual
affiliate
level
first.
having
taken
them
at
the
individual
affiliate
level...
these
were
profitable
affiliates,
they
had
no
losses
to
pass
on
to
the
consolidated
return.
the
losses
at
the
consolidated
level
are
ordinary
losses
with
a
three
year
carry
back,
not
this
special
ten
year
carry
back
that
you
can
only
get
through
juggling
of
tax
attributes
as
this
court
described
in
woolford
realty.
i
want
to
just
briefly
touch
on
one
thing
that
was
raised
in
the
reply
brief,
which
is
a
new
argument
and
which
is
wrong.
in
the
reply
brief
they
say
that
the
gottesman
case
stands
for
the
concept
that
you
construe
all
ambiguities
in
consolidated
return
regulations
against
the
secretary.
looking
at
that
case,
it's
clearly
not
what
it
holds.
what
it
says
is
that
penalty
provisions
are
narrowly
interpreted.
penalty
provisions
are
to
be
construed
against
the
secretary.
the
ordinary
rule
that
this
court
established
in
white
v.
united
states
in
305
u.s.,
which
we
always
cite
when
taxpayers
make
this
argument,
is
that
there
is
no
policy
of
lenity.
that
the
tax
provisions
are
not
interpreted
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer.
indeed,
in
a
case
like
this
involving
deductions
which
are
a
matter
of
legislative
grace,
any
ambiguity
is
to
be
resolved
against
the
taxpayer.
this
taxpayer
has
not
satisfied
the
requirement
of
showing
that
its
profitable
affiliates
had
losses
from
product
liability.
congress
did
not
intend
to
provide
benefits
for
any
other
type
of
corporation,
and
the
consolidated
return
regulations
don't
get
them
there,
either.
i
think
i've
covered
what
i
intended
to.
