no,
but
then
you're
purchasing
somebody
with
profits
in
justice
breyer's
example.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
fox?
going
back
to
your
response
to
justice
kennedy
about
the
purpose
of
the
provision...
what
about
the
fact
that
if
you
do
have
separate
corporations
in
different
lines
of
business
and
one
of
them
is
profitable
notwithstanding
its
history
of
product
liability
losses
ten
years
ago,
hasn't
that
served
the
purpose
of
allowing
that
business
entity
to
recover
the
loss
that
has
to
be
otherwise
carried
back
ten
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jones,
can
i
just
ask
one
preliminary
question?
the
statute
refers
to
in
the
case
of
a
taxpayer
which
has
a
product
liability
loss...
now,
who
is
the
taxpayer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
each
of
the
corporations--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
a
taxpayer
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
they
each
file
a
return?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
many
checks
does
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--when
they
file
that
return,
how
many
people...
how
many
different
corporations
give
the
government
money?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
jones,
you
don't
disagree
with
your
opponent's
hypothetical
involving
a
company
with
two
divisions...
a
computer
division
and
a
hot
dog
division,
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
that...
also
is
sort
of
contrary
to
the
basic
purpose
of
deduction,
it
seems
to
me.
