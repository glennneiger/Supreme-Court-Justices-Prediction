justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
respond,
mr.
fox,
to
the
claim
that
what
you're
arguing
for
is
a
double
deduction,
and
would
you
tell
me
in
the
first
instance
something
that
maybe
i
should
have
gotten
from
the
briefs,
but
i
just
couldn't
find
it.
did
the...
did
the
successful
companies
in
this
affiliated
group
which,
in
fact,
as
i
understand
it,
had
the
expenses
involved
here...
did
they
deduct
the
product
liability
expenses
in
the
course
of
calculating
what
in
effect
turned
out
to
be
positive
income
which
was
then
attributed
to
the
group?
had
they
already...
leaving
aside
the
treatment...
the
possible
treatment
of
the
loss,
has
there
already
been
a
deduction
taken
by
the
constituent
companies
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then--
justice
david
h.
souter
--why
aren't
you
asking
for
that
same
subtraction,
as
it
were,
to
have
the
further
benefit
for
the
affiliated
group?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
isn't
that
the
point?
that
they
don't
define
it
as
net
operating
loss?
i
mean,
there
is...
at
least
at
the
verbal
level,
there
is
no
such
concept.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
it
is
a
tax
case
and
i
will
make
this
mercifully
brief.
corporations
sometimes
have
the
bad
luck
to
incur
expenses
as
a
result
of
liability
for
the
products
they
sell.
in
a
year
when
their
luck
is
really
bad,
they
have
not
only
product
liability
expenses,
but
a
net
loss
from
all
operations
for
the
year.
when
that
happens,
the
tax
code
gives
them
a
break.
it
lets
them
call
their
product
liability
expenses,
what
the
tax
code
calls
a
liability
loss,
up
to
the
amount
of
the
net
operating
loss
and
it
allows
them
to
deduct
the
product
liability
loss,
so
as
to
reduce
income
in
prior
years
for
as
far
back
as
ten
years.
they
thus
get
some
of
their
old
taxes
refunded
to
soften
their
current
blow.
the
tax
code
also
allows
a
group
of
affiliated
corporations
to
file
one
tax
return
together,
a
coordinated
return
and
to
pay
only
one
tax
bill
for
the
group
instead
of
separate
bills
for
each
separate
corporation.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
how
the
consolidated
return
is
supposed
to
figure
any
product
liability
loss
to
be
carried
back
ten
years.
there
are
two
possibilities:
the
first
is,
that
each
separate
corporation
would
determine
whether
it
had
a
product
liability
loss,
if
it
did
it
would
give
that
loss
to
the
group
which
could
carry
it
back
if
the
group
had
a
net
operating
loss;
the
second
is
that
each
separate
corporation
could
simply
let
the
group
have
any
product
liability
expenses
without
bothering
to
figure
whether
each
separate
corporation,
with
a
product
liability
expense
also
had
a
net
loss.
if
the
group
had
a
net
loss,
the
group
could
then
add
up
the
separate
product
liability
expenses
to
figure
its
own
product
liability
loss
and
then
deduct
it
from
prior
year’s
income
going
back
ten
years.
what
difference
does
it
make?
it
can
make
this
difference.
if
each
corporation
has
to
figure
its
own
product
liability
loss
before
giving
it
to
the
group,
a
separate
company
with
product
liability
expenses,
but
no
net
operating
loss
won't
have
any
way
of
giving
its
product
liability
expenses
to
the
group.
if
instead
every
corporation
can
give
the
group
any
product
liability
expense
it
has
even
in
a
profitable
year,
the
group
as
a
whole
will
have
a
larger
product
liability
loss
if
the
year
is
unprofitable
for
the
group
as
a
whole.
it
will
then
have
a
bigger
deduction
against
prior
year’s
income.
the
government
wants
taxpayers
filing
coordinated
returns
like
united
dominion
here,
to
use
the
first
method,
which
will
give
it
a
lower
product
liability
loss
to
carry
back.
united
dominion
wants
to
use
the
second
method
which
will
give
it
a
higher
loss
to
carry
back.
the
fourth
circuit
decided
in
the
government’s
favor.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
a
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
fourth
circuit
and
decide
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer,
united
dominion.
you
would
not
find
a
statement
of
our
reasons
entertaining
who
listen
to
and
i
will
let
it
go
by
saying
that
any
interested
tax
lawyers
should
have
a
look
at
our
opinion
along
with
a
concurring
opinion
filed
by
justice
thomas
and
a
dissent
filed
by
justice
stevens.
