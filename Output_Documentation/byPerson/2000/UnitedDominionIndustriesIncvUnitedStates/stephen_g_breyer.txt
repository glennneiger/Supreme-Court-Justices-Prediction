justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
this
right...
and
tell
me,
if
it's
wrong,
i'm
not
going
to
pursue
it...
but
it
seems
to
me
the
theory
of
this
thing
is
that
we
have
a
company
called
company
a,
and
company
a
has,
let's
say,
a
loss
of
two
dollars
over
the
year.
and
what
this
statute
normally
says
is
wait...
company
a,
if
you
have
some
product
liability
loss,
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
can
cause
losses,
and
you
have
all
of
them.
it
was
a
terrible
company.
but
we're
going
to
pretend
that
the
two
dollars
there
is
product
liability
loss.
that's
called,
let's
pretend
that's
what
the
statute
says...
as
long
as
there
was
two
dollars
of
it.
we're
not
going
to
call
it
some
other
loss.
now,
what
you
want
to
do
is
if
company
a
is
part
of,
let's
say,
fifteen
other
companies,
you
want
to
pretend
that
the
big
losses
run
by
these
other
companies
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
product
liability
are
product
liability
losses,
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
what
you...
that's
what
you're
reading
in
the
statute--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
now,
if
that's
so,
then
there's
a
great
thing
we
could
do.
we
have
some
big
losses
in
our
company,
so
we
look
around
for
some
other
firms
that
happen
to
have
some
product
liability
losses,
but
they're
just
marginally
profitable.
now
we
buy
them
up,
and
now
our
let's
pretend
game
allows
us
to
count
as
our
losses
which
came
from
totally
other
things...
having
a
very
bad
product,
for
example...
now
are
product
liability
losses,
so
we
get
to
go
back
ten
years.
now,
that
would
be
a
consequence
of
accepting
your
position,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
lose,
do
we
create
any
anomaly,
or
is
there
some...
what
i'm
thinking
of
is
that
you
have...
the
government
has,
it
seems
to
me,
going
for
it
the
fact
the
language
is
pretty
ambiguous.
the
language
does
list
some
things
that
should
be
consolidated,
makes
no
mention
of
this.
and
there's
at
least
one
anomaly
that's
created
if
they
lose.
all
right,
you
have
going
for
you
that
the
statute
could
be
read
your
way,
you
could
want
to
play
the
let's
pretend
game
with
the
whole
set,
but
is
there
anything
else
you
have
going
for
you
in
terms
of
policy
that
you
want
to
bring
up,
or
in
terms
of
anomalies
that
would
be
created
if
you
lost?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
that's...
accepting
that,
and
you
just
point
this
out
to
me
where
i
didn't
know
that
the
regs
actually
determined
this.
i
thought
the
regs
were
regs
for
calculating
separable
income,
et
cetera.
and
then
you
throw
it
all
together
and
you
calculate
and
see
a
loss
overall.
and
then
the
question
is,
should
we
count
that
loss
overall
as
if
it
were
product
liability
loss?
and
what
i
didn't
know
is
there
is
something
that
says,
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now
the
wording
gets
you
there
in
the
calculation.
if
i
go
through
reading
the
wording,
i
won't
be
able
to
get
to
their
result.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
no,
i'll
do
it.
i'll
go
through
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
i
should,
when
i
go
through
it,
figure
out
that
their
reading
is
possible,
then
is
there
some
good
reading...
reason
why
they
aren't
right?
i
mean,
their...
their
point
would
be,
look,
this
is
supposed
to
treat
the
thing
like
a
big
business,
and
if
it
were
a
big
single
business,
we
could
do
it,
so
why
can't
we
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but...
i'm
sorry...
i
didn't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
go
back
to
the
first
horrible...
could
somebody
just
do
it
now,
even
if
you
win,
by
simply
folding
the
acquired
company
into
its
company
so
there's
just
one
entity
rather
than
the
consolidated
one?
