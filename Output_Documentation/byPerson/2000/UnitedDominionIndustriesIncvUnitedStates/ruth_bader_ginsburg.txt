mr.
fox--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
understand
that
there's
no
dispute
at
all
about
the
amount
involved.
as
you
said,
it's
just
a
question
of
whether
it's
a
three
year
carry
back
or
a
ten
year
carry
back.
but
there's
one
feature
of
your
case
that's
different
from
the
intermet
case...
the
other
side
of
this
split...
and
that
in
intermet,
the
corporation
had
sustained
the
loss
that
lynchburg
was
also
a
member
of
the
consolidated
group
in
the
carry
back
year.
but
as
i
understand
the
facts
of
your
case,
you...
the
deductions
of
the
losses
sustained
in
'83
to
'86,
and
you
want
to
carry
it
back
to
'73?
years
when
the
corporations
had
sustained
the
loss
were
not
part
of
the
affiliated
group.
why
should
it
be
carried
back...
why
should
the
affiliated
group
get
this
benefit
when
the
companies
who
sustained
the
loss
were
not
part
of
it
in
those
carry
back
years?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
did
they
find
it,
mr.
fox?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
know,
but
had
it
been
argued?
it
was...
it
was
the...
where
did
it
come
from?
did
the
government
put
it
in
its
brief,
or
did
they
just
pick
it
out
of
the
air?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
fox,
isn't
that
the
point
of
the
government's...
the
note
it
makes
on
page
41?
the
footnote
in
which
it
says
there's
no
logical
reason
why
petitioner
should
be
able
to
use
these
deductions
to
create
product
liability
losses
for
itself
simply
because
the
affiliated
corporations
that
actually
incurred
the
product
liability
expenses
realized
profits
instead
of
losses.
the
anomaly
that...
as
you
said,
the
regulation
doesn't
cover
the
profit
for
a
corporation,
but
it
would
cover
one
where
there
had
been
losses.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
your
underlying
rationale...
and
justice
breyer
asked
you
about
policy
questions...
that
there's
really
no
reason
to
treat
this
affiliated
group
any
differently
than
you
would
treat
one
corporation
that
had
separate
divisions?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
just
used
the
term
consolidated
taxpayer--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
jones,
your
position
that
you're
now
announcing
has
been
rejected,
the
position
that
you're
taking
on
brief
here
is
rejected
by
the
fourth
circuit,
and
they
made
it
very
clear
that
they
weren't
buying
that,
and
they
had
an
alternate
position.
i
have
two
questions
for
you.
one
is,
going
into
this
whole
picture
with
this
company,
there
was
an
agent...
and
i
assume
that
this
large
amount
of
money
had
to
go
up
higher
in
the
service
who
said,
yeah,
they're
right,
under
the
consolidated
regs
that
now
exist,
they
get
this
refund.
and
it
was
a
congressional
joint
committee
that
said
no.
so
the
service
initially
agreed.
therefore,
it
leads
me
to
think
that
there
has
been
no
consistent
clear
position
that
the
service
has
taken.
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
then
in
litigation,
since
the
fourth
circuit
clearly
rejected
the
position
that
you
are
pressing
on
brief,
what
is
the
consistent
position
that
you're
taking
on
litigation?
has
the
government
ever
taken
the
position
that
the
fourth
circuit
takes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jones,
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
on
this
point
again,
but
as
i
understand
it
that
isn't
the
rationale
that
the
fourth
circuit
went
on.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
i'm
asking
you
first
is,
has
the
government
ever
taken
the
position
that
the
fourth
circuit
adopted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
fourth
circuit,
as
i
understand
it,
was
not
relying
on
the
regulation
that
relates
to
separate
return
years.
that
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yeah,
they
were.
that's
right.
they
were.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
weren't
doing
it
in
the
limited
sense
of
a
separate
return
year.
they
were
generalizing
that.
they
were
taking
that
the
regs--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--label
separate
return
year,
and
they
were
saying,
well,
we
could
use
this
methodology
across
the
board.
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
fourth
circuit
did--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
jones,
the
fourth
circuit
did
explicitly
disagree
with
your
1.1502-12
position
that
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
it
said...
it
said
right
in
the...
it's
in
18a
of
the
appendix
to
the
cert
petition
that
that
was
an
incorrect
position.
and
if
you
missed
that
statement,
they
repeated
it
later
by
saying
that
they
often
strain
to
disagree
with
that
position.
so
it's
clear
that
the
fourth
circuit
rejected
the
position
you're
now
presenting.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
may
i
put
this
question
to
you,
mr.
jones?
suppose
we
agree
with
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit
that
the
position
you
are
taking
about
1502-12
is
incorrect.
do
you
embrace
the
position
that
the
fourth
circuit
takes
as
a
proper
way
to
resolve
this
case
and
all
other--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
if
you
don't...
if
we
agree
with
the
fourth
circuit
that
the
position
you're
taking
is
incorrect,
so
that's
out
of
the
picture...
we're
not
going
to
just
assume
that
we
agree
with
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit...
there's
no
split
on
that,
and
then
so
we
have
to
look
for
an
alternative
if
we're
going
to
use...
and
rule
in
your
favor,
and
i'm
asking
you
is
the
one
that
the
fourth
circuit
took,
the
one
that
the
government
would
urge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
it
a
hundred
and
eighty
degrees
off
in
intermet
to
say
a
separate
taxable
income's
character
as
positive
or
negative
has
no
independent
significance?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
was
also
wrong
when
they
said
a
member's
product
liability
expenses
affect
the
group's
consolidated
net
operating
loss,
dollar
for
dollar,
whether
the
member
has
a
positive
or
negative
separate
taxable
income.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
can--
