we'll
hear
argument
now
in
nunber
00-157,
united
dominion
industries,
inc.
v.
united
states.
mr.
fox.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
fox.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
jones,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
question
is
how
many
give
them
money,
not
whether
they--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
resolution
is
that,
and
what
reg
is
that?
you
say
this
is
resolved
by
a
regulation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
this
is
not
the
same
thing
as
was
pointed
out
in
questions
before
as
the
thing
you're
analogizing
it
to.
i
mean,
it's
just
an
analogy,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
colleague
disputes,
and
the
court
of
appeals
happen
to
agree,
that
your
reliance
on
1502-12
simply
solves
this.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
said
this
is
control...
as
i
understand
your
answer,
this
is
controlled
by
1502-12.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--which
is...
which
is--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--which
defines
separate
taxable
income.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
opponent
says
that
is
not
controlling,
and
the
courts
of
appeals
have
not
agreed
with
you
on
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
about
the
courts
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
nothing--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
jones.
mr.
jones,
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
a
strategy
to
avoid
the
payment
of
taxes.
the
internal
revenue
code
doesn't
prevent
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
jones.
mr.
fox,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fox.
the
case
is
submitted.
