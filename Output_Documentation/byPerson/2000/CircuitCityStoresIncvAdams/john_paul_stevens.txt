justice
john
paul
stevens
what
conclusion
do
you
draw
from
that?
i'm
wondering,
under
your
view,
are
employees
of
travel
agents
covered
within
the
exclusion,
or
are
they
covered?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
about
ticket
agents
for
railroads?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
draw
a
distinction
between
ticket
agents
who
sell
them
as
employees
of
the
railroad
and
those
who
sell
them
as
employees
of
the
travel
agent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
that's
what
congress
had
in
mind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--railroad
employees
engaged
in
foreign
or
interstate
commerce.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
take
it
what
you're
suggesting,
you
have
to
give
some
content
to
other
class
of
workers
engaged
in
commerce.
don't
you
suggest
that
that's
engaged
in
transportation
or
something?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
see,
if
we
accept
your
view
we
have
to
have
a
jurisprudence
of
what
transportation
is.
if
we
accept
the
respondent's
view,
we
have
to
have
a
jurisprudence
on
what
an
employment
contract
is.
both
require
interpretation,
but
the
latter
is
a
statutory
term.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
former
is
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
you...
just,
i
want
to
be
sure
you
give
us
your
best
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
initial
question
as
to
the
reason
why
there's
this
rather
narrow
exception
from
a
broad
provision.
