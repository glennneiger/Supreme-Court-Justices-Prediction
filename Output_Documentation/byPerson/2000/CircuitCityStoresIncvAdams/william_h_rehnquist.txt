we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
99-1379,
circuit
city
stores
v.
saint
clair
adams.
mr.
nagle.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
even
if
the
faa
doesn't
apply
to
employment
contracts,
state
arbitration
rules
can...
they
can
be
used,
can
they
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
rubin,
if
your
position
is
correct,
why
didn't,
in
section
1,
congress
simply
stop
with,
shall
apply
to
contracts
of
employment,
period?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
was
the
bill
actually
passed?
when
was
the
law
passed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
'25.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
gather
he
failed,
since
he
sent
the
letter
in
1923
and
the
bill
was
passed
in
1925.

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
going
to
be--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you're
going
to
be
arbitrating
under
the
kind
of
agreements
you
describe
simply
between
the...
either
under
state
law
or
under
federal
law,
aren't
you?
i
mean,
there's
no
other
way
to
do
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
isn't
symmetry.
i
mean,
there's
different
language
used
in
the
two
sections.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
very
odd
definition
of
symmetry.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rubin.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
nagle,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nagle.
the
case
is
submitted.
