is
the
word
class
important
to
your
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
would
your
argument
be
just
the
same
without--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
it
would
seem
to
me
to
help
your
argument
somewhat,
because
we...
the
statute
asks
us
to
think
in
terms
of
classes
of
workers,
rather
than
individual
workers
engaged--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
why
wouldn't
those
courts
have
said
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
just
a
superseding
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or,
lmra,
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
doesn't
the
301
reasoning
explain
what
the
circuits
have
done
and
say,
well,
these
are
just
controlled
by
another
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
maybe
your
answer
is,
we've
already
rewritten
section

justice
anthony
m.

under
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
interpreted,
if
there
is
an
arbitration
clause
in
a
contract
and
if
the
act
applies,
a
state
cannot
override
the
act
by
allowing
litigants
to
go
to
court
before
an
arbitration
is
conducted.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
act
applies
to
this
contract
and
it
is
an
employment
contract.
an
employee
brought
suit
against
his
employers
circuit
city
stores
in
the
california
court.
the
employee
alleged
violation
of
certain
california
statutes,
the
employer
relied
on
an
arbitration
clause
in
the
employment
contract
and
sought
to
compel
arbitration
under
it.
section
1
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
says
that
“the
act
does
not
apply
to
certain
cases
and
it
refers
to
contracts
of
employment
of
three
classifications:
contracts
of
employment
of
seamen,
railroad
employees,
or
any
other
class
of
workers
engaged
in
foreign
or
interstate
commerce”,
and
this
is
its
last
clause
that
is
the
subject
of
the
dispute.
outside
the
ninth
circuit
the
courts
of
appeals
which
have
addressed
the
issue
say
that
phrase
“other
class
of
workers
engaged
in
commerce”
is
limited
just
to
transportation
workers.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
holds
that
this
last
clause
applies
to
all
employment
contracts
including
the
contract
that
was
involved
in
this
case.
since
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
various
circuits
were
in
disagreement
we
granted
certiorari.
we
now
hold
that
the
last
phrase
of
section
1
applies
to
transportation
workers
and
not
to
all
workers.
so,
there
is
a
broad
class
of
employment
contracts
including
the
one
that
is
here
at
issue
which
are
subject
to
the
act.
the
opinion
for
the
court
discusses
principles
of
statutory
construction
and
which
gives
support
to
the
conclusion.
the
court
also
address
the
argument
that
the
term
“engaged
in
commerce”
should
be
interpreted
in
limitations
on
congress'
authority
when
the
federal
arbitration
act
was
enacted
in
1925.
that
was
a
time
when
congressional
authority
to
regulate
under
the
commerce
power
was
confined
by
our
decisions
to
a
far
greater
extent
than
it
is
today.
this
court
however
has
declined
in
past
cases
to
afford
significance
in
construing
the
meaning
of
the
statutory
jurisdictional
provision
engaged
in
commerce.
to
the
circumstance
of
the
statute
predates
shifts
in
the
court's
commerce
clause
cases,
to
say
that
the
statutory
words
engaged
in
commerce
are
subject
to
variable
interpretations
depending
upon
the
date
of
adoption,
even
a
date
before
the
phrase
become
term
of
art,
ignores
the
reason
why
the
formulation
became
a
turn
of
art
in
the
first
place.
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words
“engaged
in
commerce”
is
narrower
than
the
open-ended
formulations
or
more
open-ended
formulations
"affecting
commerce"
or
"involving
commerce".
it
is
argued
that
states
should
be
permitted,
pursuant
to
their
traditional
role
in
regulating
employment
relationships
to
prohibit
employees
like
the
respondent
here
from
contracting
away
their
right
to
pursue
state-law
discrimination
claims
in
court.
it
is
not
our
holding
today
which
is
the
proper
target
of
this
criticism.
that
line
of
argument
is
relevant
instead
to
the
court's
1984
decision
in
southland
corp.
versus
keating,
holding
that
congress
intended
the
faa
to
apply
in
state
courts,
and
to
preempt
state
antiarbitration
laws
to
the
contrary.
the
question
of
southland's
continuing
vitality
was
given
explicit
consideration
in
our
1995
decision,
the
decision
called
allied-bruce,
terminix
versus
dobson,
and
we
there
declined
overrule
southland.
the
court
should
not
chip
away
at
southland
by
indirection,
especially
by
the
adoption
of
the
variable
statutory
interpretation
theory
advanced
by
the
respondent
in
this
case.
in
allied-bruce
the
court
noted
that
congress
had
not
moved
to
overturn
southland
and
we
now
note
that
it
has
not
done
so
in
response
to
allied-bruce
either.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
reversed.
