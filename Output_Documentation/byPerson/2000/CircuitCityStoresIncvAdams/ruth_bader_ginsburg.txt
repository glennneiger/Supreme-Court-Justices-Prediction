employed
in
is
not
the
same
as
engaged
in,
but
i'd
like
to
go
back,
first,
to
the
involving
term.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
using
words
and
say
that...
saying
that
in
the
second
section,
involved
is
a
very
broad
term,
and
in
the
first
section
engaged
is
a
narrow
term.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
some
of
the
briefs
in
this
case
tell
us
that
involved
in
is
not
affecting
commerce,
that
indeed
this
is
the
only
piece
of
federal
legislation
that
uses
the
words,
involved
in.
is
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so...
but
you're
asking
us
to
say
that
congress
meant
in
1925
something
different
in
using
these
two
words.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
the
congress'
notion
of
the
limits
of
its
power,
doesn't
that
explain
why
they
didn't
say
contract
of
employment,
period?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
skipping
the
legislative
history,
mr.
nagle,
why
is
it
so
narrow?
it
says,
engaged
in
commerce,
and
even
in
1925
that
extended
beyond
transportation
workers.
you
want
the
cutoff
to
be
transportation
workers,
i
take
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
communications
workers,
those
were
not
included
as
engaged
in
commerce?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
say
as
of
1925,
the
only
workers
engaged
in
commerce
were
those
who
were
engaged
in
the
moving
of
goods,
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
would
you
have
removal
to
the
federal
court
unless
you
had
diversity
if
it's
state
law
that
controls?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
these
are
employment
relations,
wouldn't
most
of
them
be
diversity...
most
of
them
be
nondiverse,
that
is,
a
worker
and
employer
in
the
same
state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wouldn't
it
be
the
place
where
the
work
is
performed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
nevertheless,
it
would
be
state
law
that
would
control,
some
state
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
very
well,
mr.
nagle.
mr.
rubin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rubin,
there's
also
the
phrase,
contract
of
employment.
you
were
candid
in
telling
us
that
you
consider
workers
to
include
any
employee,
even
managerial
employees.
what
about
collective
bargaining
contracts?
are
they...
where
do
they
stand
as...
do
they
fall
within
the
section
1
exclusion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
was
that
consistent
with...
we're
told
that
the
ninth
circuit
is
the
only
one
that
holds
that
all
employment
contracts
are
out
under
section
1,
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
was
the
reasoning
in
the
circuits
for
saying
that
collective
bargaining
contracts
are
excluded?
is
it
that
they
were
not
contracts
of
employment?
