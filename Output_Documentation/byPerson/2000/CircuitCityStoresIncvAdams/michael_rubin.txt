mr.
michael
rubin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
we
agree
with
petitioner
in
response
to
the
question
from
justice
scalia
that
the
focus
of
the
court's
inquiry
today
has
to
be
on
what
congress
meant
in
1925,
whether
it
intended
the
section
1
exclusion
to
go...
to
remain
symmetrical
with
the
section
2
coverage.
mr.
michael
rubin
congress
could
have
done
it
that
way,
but
it
used
the
language
that
was
presented
to
it
by
secretary
hoover,
who
stated...
whose
letter
was
both
in
the
1923
committee
hearing
and
was
also
reprinted
in
the
1924
committee
hearing.
secretary
hoover--
mr.
michael
rubin
--it
was
enacted
into
law
in
february
1925.
mr.
michael
rubin
secretary
hoover,
just
2
weeks
after
the
seamen's
union
expressed
concerns
not
only
about
its
application
to
seamen,
but
according
to
mr.
furiceff
to
seamen,
railroad
men
and
sundry
other
workers
in
interstate
and
foreign
commerce,
wrote
a
letter
to
the
chair
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
in
which
he
said,
if
there
appear
to
be
objections
to
the
inclusion
of
workers'
contracts,
then
he
proposes
that
the
following
language
be
used.
the
language
that
he
proposed
is
the
identical
language
that
congress
used
in
the
section
1
exclusion.
while--
mr.
michael
rubin
--there
is--
mr.
michael
rubin
--there
is
a
linguistic
explanation
for
what
they
did.
while
congress
could
have
limited
that
way
had
it
been
presented
in
a
different
way,
congress'...
secretary
hoover
asked
congress
to
expedite
passage
of
the
bill
to
satisfy
the
commercial
interests
who
were
urging
it.
mr.
michael
rubin
he
did...
he
was
successful
in
getting
the
language
that
he
proposed
included
in
the
bill
immediately
after
he
proposed
it,
but
why
is
the
additional
language
in
there,
what
purpose
does
it
serve,
because
that,
i
think,
is
the
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question.
well,
we
start
with
the
first
two
phrases,
the
first
two
classes,
seamen,
and
railroad
employees.
now,
in
1925,
given
how
limited
congress'
commerce
clause
power
was,
there
weren't
that
many
categories
of
workers
who
were
actually
covered
by
congress.
in
fact,
the
only
private
sector
employees
that
were
covered
by
any
federal
statute
under
the
commerce
clause
power
in
1925
were
seamen
and
railroad
employees,
so
not
only
was--
mr.
michael
rubin
--i'm
sorry.
they
were
covered
by
federal
statutes.
mr.
michael
rubin
excuse
me
if
i
misspoke.
mr.
michael
rubin
then...
then,
because
the
objection
from
labor,
which
secretary
hoover
at
least
urged
congress
to
overcome,
however
quickly
or
not
it
might
have
happened,
referred
more
broadly
to
all
classes
of
employees,
because
the
underlying
concern
was
the
disparity
in
bargaining
power,
as
this
court
acknowledged
in
prima
paint
in
its
footnote
9,
when
it
referred
to
the
section
1
exclusion,
because
the
disparity
in
bargaining
power
applies
between
all
workers
and
bosses
as
perceived
by
labor
at
the
time,
and
as
reflected
by
congress
in
1932
in
the
norris
la
guardia
act.
congress
went
beyond
that.
mr.
michael
rubin
there
is--
mr.
michael
rubin
--our
position
is
yes.
mr.
michael
rubin
just
like
fela
at
the
time,
we
believe,
would
have
covered
an
on
the
job
injury
by
a
high
executive
of
a
railroad
company,
it
is
our
construction
that
worker
and
employee
means
anyone
employed
by
a
company.
there
is
an
amicus
brief
that
argues
otherwise.
mr.
michael
rubin
that
is
possible.
mr.
michael
rubin
you
certainly
do
not
have
to
decide
that.
mr.
michael
rubin
there
was
not.
mr.
michael
rubin
there
was
not.
we
have
cited
numerous
statutes,
as
well
as
cases
of
the
time.
there
is
not
a
single
statute
in
effect
in
1925
or
a
case
describing
the
commerce
power
as
it
pertained
to
employees
that
used
a
broader
term
than
engaged
in.
mr.
michael
rubin
behrens
and
shanks.
the
behrens
and
shanks
case
arose
under
the
amended
fela,
the
1908
version
of
fela.
that
act
referred
initially
to
engaged
in,
but
then
on
two
separate
occasions
had
what
we
characterize
as
a
temporal
limitation.
it
said,
while
engaged
in.
it
specifically
limited
the
scope
to
less
than
the
full
commerce
power,
as
would
have
been
expressed
by
the
term,
engaged
in,
and
in
shanks
and
in
behrens,
and
in
several
other
cases,
this
court
expressly
noted
that
whether
workers
were
covered
by
the
amended
fela
or
not,
turned
upon
whether
the
injury
they
suffered
occurred
while
they
were
engaged
in.
it
didn't
focus
on
the
type
of
work
they
generally
performed.
it...
for
instance,
in
behrens,
i
believe,
the
worker
was
working
on
an
interstate...
intrastate
traffic.
his
job
often
included
interstate
traffic.
he
would
be
engaged
in
commerce,
but
because
at
the
time
he
was
hit
by
the
locomotive
he
was
engaged
in
solely
intrastate
work,
the
court
said
that,
given
the
temporal
limitation
of
fela,
it
doesn't
apply.
so
those
cases
support
our
position.
shanks
in
particular
supports
our
position
because
shanks
goes
to...
the
fela
law
was
very
complicated.
there
were
many,
many
cases
coming
before
this
court
trying
to
decide
who
is
and
who
is
not
covered
by
the
various
limitations.
shanks
goes
through
and
summarizes
the
supreme
court
jurisprudence
of
the
time
under
fela
and
makes
very
clear
that
engaged
in
is
as
broad
as
it
gets,
because
it
includes
not
just
those
narrowly
working
on
the
trains
as
they
were
going
down
the
tracks,
but
everyone
whose
job
is
sufficiently
related
as
to
be
practically
a
part
of
the
interstate
commerce.
so
at
the
time,
in
1925,
engaged
in
was
a
term
of
art.
it
was
a
term
of
art
that
reached
to
the
full
scope
of
congress'
commerce
power.
that
is
to
complete
the
answer
as
to...
actually,
it
doesn't
quite
complete
the
answer,
because
there
are
still
some
words
that
we
have
to
address.
that
explains,
we
believe,
why
there
was
the
reference
to
in...
engaged
in
foreign
or
interstate
commerce,
because
that
was
the
common
use
of
art
whenever--
mr.
michael
rubin
--the
two
sections
were
drafted
at
different
times
by
different
people.
a--
mr.
michael
rubin
--a--
mr.
michael
rubin
--the--
mr.
michael
rubin
--there
is
a
reason
why
the
locutions
in
section
2
are
different
from
those
in
section
1,
and
that
is
because
the
language
in
section
2,
the
coverage
provision
refers
to...
and
it's
an
odd
locution,
one
that
we've
certainly
not
seen
in
other
statutes...
contract
evidencing
a
transaction
involving
commerce.
the
word
engaged,
had
engaged
come
first,
would
not
have
fit
in
that
phrase,
because
there
can't
be
a
contract
evidencing
a
transaction
engaged
in
commerce,
because
a
transaction
cannot
engage
in
commerce.
by
the
same
token,
in
the
section
1
exclusion
it
would
have
made
no
sense
to
use
the
word,
involving,
because
workers
aren't
involving
commerce.
now,
perhaps
they're
involved
in--
mr.
michael
rubin
--then
that
has--
mr.
michael
rubin
--it
both
adds
more
words,
it
does
not
respond
to
the
concerns
of
those--
mr.
michael
rubin
--it
does
not
address
the
concerns
of
those
who
were
objecting,
because
it
used
the
exact
language
that
they
proposed.
there's
one
more
phrase
that
i
haven't
addressed,
and
that's
the
any
other.
i
know
justice
kennedy
asked
about
the
class,
but
the
complete
phrase
is,
any
other
class
of
workers
and,
as
this
court
has
stated
on
several
occasions,
when
congress
uses
terms
such
as...
in
fact,
when
it
uses
the
language,
any
other,
it
means
exactly
that,
any
other.
that's
as
broad
as
it
gets.
that
is
language
without
limitation,
and
instead
of
saying,
any
other
class
of
workers
in
transportation,
which
is
essentially
what
petitioner's
argument
would
have
the
court
read
section
1
to
mean,
commerce
was
a
defined
term
of
art.
section
1
itself
defined
commerce
as,
interstate
or
foreign
commerce,
as
broad
as
it
gets.
it
didn't
say,
commerce
means
transportation.
petitioner
would
not
only
have
the
court
adopt
the
illogical
explanation
that
congress
excluded
from
this
bill
those
workers
over
whom
its
commerce
power
was
the
clearest
and
federalize
the
law
of
arbitration
only
those
as
to
whom
i
believe
justice
o'connor
said
was
most
questionable--
mr.
michael
rubin
--yes,
and
in
fact
the
majority
of
the
circuits
agree
with
the
proposition
that
collective
bargaining
agreements
are
excluded.
various
amici
have
totalled
up,
i
think
5
to
3,
but
yes,
collective
bargaining
agreements--
mr.
michael
rubin
--i
believe
the
more
accurate
statement
would
be
that
those
circuits
that
focused
solely
on
individual
employment
contracts
drew
that
distinction,
because
in
fact,
going
back
to
20,
25
years,
the
majority
of
the
circuits
have
said
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
are
excluded.
the
practical
effect
is
minimal,
because
the
labor
management
relations
act,
section
301,
as
this
court
clearly
held
in
lincoln
mills
v.
textile
workers,
does
ensure
the
federal
common
law
of
arbitrability
for
collective
bargaining
agreements.
mr.
michael
rubin
no,
no,
no.
it's
precisely
the
opposite,
because
they
were
contracts
of
employment
of
any
other
class
of
workers.
mr.
michael
rubin
yes.
mr.
michael
rubin
the
national...
the...
section
301
of
the
lmra
is
a
different
statute.
mr.
michael
rubin
is
a...
well,
this
court
in
lincoln
mills
was
faced
with
a
choice
as
to
whether,
in
deciding
to
hold
collective
bargaining
agreement
arbitration
provisions
enforceable,
it
should
do
so
under
the
faa,
as
the
lower
court
had
held,
by
the
way,
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
lincoln
mills,
or
whether
to
hold
it
enforceable
under
section
301,
which
was
enacted
in
1947.
the
court
chose
section
301.
the
court
made
no
reference
whatsoever
in
its
opinion
to
the
faa,
and
that's
where
justice
frankfurter
in
his
dissent
first
laid
out
the
argument
that
we're
following
up
on
in
our
briefs
to
say
that
the
faa
is
inapplicable
for
this--
mr.
michael
rubin
--the
circuits
who
have
drawn
that
distinction
have
not
relied
on
301.
sometimes
the
cases
arise
in
the
question
of
which
statute
of
limitations
applies,
whether
you
borrow
the
federal
arbitration
act
statute
of
limitations
or
not,
but
that
hasn't
been
the
distinguishing
characteristic
and,
of
course,
this
case
not
being
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
certainly
lmra
section
301
does
not
apply
to
this
case.
mr.
michael
rubin
no.
some
have,
as
we
pointed
out,
restricted
it
to
employees
of
common
carriers.
mr.
michael
rubin
well,
there
are--
mr.
michael
rubin
--i
think
the
first,
fourth,
fifth,
sixth,
and
tenth
have...
and
the
ninth.
mr.
michael
rubin
yes.
mr.
michael
rubin
yes.
mr.
michael
rubin
no.
mr.
michael
rubin
there--
mr.
michael
rubin
--there
are
several
levels
of
responses,
but
i
think
to
address
what
i
understand
your
concern
to
be,
workers
and
employers
can
always
enter
into
voluntary
arbitration
agreements.
they
can
always
decide
between
themselves
after
a
dispute
arises,
for
example,
that
they
choose
to
pursue
an
arbitration
mechanism
rather
than
to
go
into
court.
if
they
agree
to
arbitrate,
there
is
no
problem.
it's
not
like
the
old
common
law
hostility
to
arbitration.
there's
no
question
that
it
would
be
enforceable.
mr.
michael
rubin
they...
in
a
few...
the
ultimate
issue
here
is
whether
states
can
determine
whether
the
employment
relationships
in
those
states,
whether
an
arbitration
agreement
is
enforceable
or
not.
mr.
michael
rubin
in
those--
mr.
michael
rubin
--if
someone
is
to
go
to
court--
mr.
michael
rubin
--to
enforce
an
arbitration
agreement
that
one
side
is
objecting
to--
mr.
michael
rubin
--yes.
it's
either
the
state
law
or
the
federal
law
that
will
apply
in
this
case
determines
whether--
mr.
michael
rubin
--i'm
not
asking
you
to
rewrite
the
language,
justice
scalia.
i'm
asking
you
to
accept
that
congress
in
1925
saw
a
symmetry,
saw
an
objection,
responded
to
it
by
making
sure
that
any
worker
that
might
be...
if
there
were
any
worker
out
there
whose
contract
of
employment
evidenced
a
transaction
involving
commerce,
they
would
be
taken
out
of
the
act
completely.
mr.
michael
rubin
to--
mr.
michael
rubin
--to
get
back
to
the
very
first
question
you
asked
petitioner's
counsel,
what
did
congress
mean
by
the
language
used
in
1925.
involving,
which
had
never
been
used
before
in
a
commerce
relationship
and
has
never
been
used
since,
could
not
have
meant
anything
more
than
engaged
in,
because
engaged
in
was
as
far
as
it
got.
so
to
the
extent
there
has
been
a
rewriting...
and
i'm
not
contending
there's
been
a
rewriting.
i'm
contending
there's
been
an
application
under
the
modern
interpretation
of
the
commerce
clause.
as
this
court
in
terminex
said,
you
have
to
look
to
see
what
congress
is
trying
to
achieve.
what
were
the
purposes?
and
when
the
court
read,
involved
in--
mr.
michael
rubin
--in
fact,
in
terminex
in
1925,
that...
that's
what
happened.
the
language
in
1925
maintained
that
symmetry,
maintained
that
symmetry
for
purposes
that
were
stated
that
are
in
the
record.
there
is
no
indication
of
any
reason
why
congress
would
have
disrupted
that
symmetry,
what
purposes
could
be
served,
how
it
could
be--
mr.
michael
rubin
--it's
symmetry,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that
because
some
felt
that
the
coverage
language
might
encompass
workers'
contracts
of
employment,
congress,
to
the
fullest
extent
it
could,
pulled
those
workers
out.
mr.
michael
rubin
symmetry
may
not
be
the
right
word.
the
concept
is
the
word
that
i'm
trying
to
convey
to
the
court,
and
the
concept
is
the
concept
of
ensuring
that
no
contracts
of
employment
that
might
be
covered
under
congress'
commerce
power
would
be
covered.
one
provision
should
not
be
read
dynamically,
as
this
court
did
in
terminex,
while
the
other
is
read
statically.
there's
no
indication
that
congress
intended
that.
congress
didn't
use
the
word,
transportation.
it
had
enacted
numerous
statutes
by
1925
that
had
limited
the
scope
to
transportation,
or
to
common
carriers,
or
to
common
carriers
by
railroad.
it
had
that
language
readily
available
to
it
had
it
intended
the
carve
out,
but
there
is
no
gap
between
the
section
2
coverage
and
the
section
1
exclusion
and,
therefore,
just
as
in
1925,
all
workers'
contracts
of
employment
were
excluded,
any
other
class
of
workers,
the
broadest
possible
language,
so,
too,
we
urge
the
court
to
construe
the
statute
that
way
now.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
michael
rubin
--thank
you.
