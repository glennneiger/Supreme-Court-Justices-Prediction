why
is
that?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
an
exception
is
just
as
important
as
the
rule.
why
should
we
unrealistically
construe
it
just
because
it's
an
exception?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
tell
that
to
the
members
of
congress?
when
you
vote
for
this
exception,
bear
in
mind
that
we're
not
going
to
take
it
to
have
its
most
reasonable
meaning.
we're
going
to
construe
it
narrowly.
why?
why
would
we
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then,
fine,
so
your
case
really
turns,
it
seems
to
me,
on
the
point
that
the
language
used
by
the
congress
that
enacted
this
statute
in
section
1
was
at
that
time
narrower
than
the
language
used
in
section
2.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
what
support
do
you
have
for
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
be
precise
about
the
words.
are
we
talking
about,
involved
in
commerce,
or
involving
commerce?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
quite
different
than
involved
in
commerce.
you
can
say
someone
is
involved
in
commerce.
i
think
that's
quite
different
from
saying
that
somehow
this...
it's
a
contract
involving
commerce.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it's
important
to
your
case
that
involving
commerce
is
a
broader
concept
than
involved
in
commerce.
justice
antonin
scalia
involving
commerce
means
pertaining
to
commerce.
justice
antonin
scalia
involved
in
commerce
means
pretty
much
the
same
as
engaged
in
commerce,
it
seems
to
me,
and
so
if
involving
commerce
is
the
same
as
involved
in
commerce,
and
involved
in
commerce
is
the
same
as
engaged
in
commerce,
you
lose.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
put
it
shortly.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
it
doesn't
appear.
the
phrase
is
involving
commerce.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
broad
coverage
of
section--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
section
2.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
could
have
said
in
that
section,
don't
you
think...
do
you
think
it
would
have
been
any
different
if
they
had
said,
seamen
involved
in
commerce,
as
opposed
to
engaged
in
commerce?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
suppose
their
answer
is,
congress
has
already
regulated
seamen,
they're
about
to
regulate
railroad
employees,
so
they
want
to
make
very
sure
that
those
are
excluded,
and
then
they
go
on
to
the
limits
of
their
commerce
power,
which
were
vague
at
the
time,
and
give
everyone
else
the
same
protection
that
seamen
and
railroad
workers
have.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
you
tell
me
just
for
the
record,
what
are
the
best
cases
that
you
have
to
establish
the
proposition
that
at
the
time
this
legislation
was
enacted
it
was
already
well
established
that
engaged
in
commerce
was
not
the
limit
of
the
congress'
power
over
interstate
commerce?
what
are
your
best
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
very
good
sleuthing,
but
i
mean,
this
is
a
letter.
this
is
not
even
a
committee
report.
it
is
a
letter
sent
2
years
before
this
statute
is
enacted,
and
you
want
us
to
assume
that
that
is
the
only
reason,
not
only
that
congress
didn't
end
the
sentence
in
section
1
with
employment
contracts,
but
it
is...
but
also
it
explains
why
congress
didn't
at
least,
if
it
was
not
going
to
end
the
sentence
there,
at
least
use
the
same
language
in
section
1
that
it
did
in
section
2.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that
is
a
very
difficult
thing
to
explain.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
were
covered
by
the
commerce
clause
power,
or
by
any
federal
statutes?
justice
antonin
scalia
by
federal
statutes.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
would
include
an
employment
contract
between
a
ceo
and
a
corporation,
i
assume,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
mean,
you're
painting
this
as--
justice
antonin
scalia
--your
position
is
simply
covering
the
hard
hat
lunch
bucket
worker,
but
i
assume
it
would
cover
a
contract
between
a
ceo
and
his
corporation.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
wasn't...
but
then
they
would
have
used
it
in
section
2.
i
mean,
you
have
a
very
difficult
phenomenon
to
explain,
that
is
the
fact
that
congress
obviously
and
intentionally
used
different
language
in
section
1
and
section
2.
that
is
just
terrible
drafting,
just
terrible
drafting
if
congress
was
trying
to
do
what
you
say
they
were
trying
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
well
be,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
congress
is
supposed
to
come
up
with
a
coherent
bill,
and
we
usually
assume
it
was
all
drafted
at
the
same
time
and
somebody
sat
down
and
used
the
same
words
to
mean
the
same
things
throughout
the
statute,
and
we
usually
assume
that
when
they
use
different
words
they
mean
different
things.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
engaged
in
businesses
involving
commerce.
workers
in
businesses
involving
commerce.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it's
so
easy
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you're
worried
about
adding
words,
they
could
have
ended
it
after
workers
and
it
would
have
achieved
the
same
result.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rubin,
your
argument
assumes
that
giving
a
broader
modern
meaning
to
section
2
and
giving
a
broader
modern
meaning
to
section
1
are
one
and
the
same
things.
i
really
don't
think
that
that's
what's
going
on
here.
i
mean,
what
you're
really
asking
us
to
do
is
to
change
the
language
of
section
1
in
light
of
the
fact
that
we
now
know
that
congress
could
have
gone
further
than
it
chose
to
go
in
that
language.
i
don't
know
any
other
case
where
we've
done
that.
you're
not
asking
us
to
simply
give
that
language
its
modern,
more
expansive
meaning.
you're
asking
us
to
say,
you
know,
in
light
of
the
fact
that
we
now
know
that
it's
not
just
employees
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
who
can
be
covered.
had
congress
known
that
then,
they
would
have
written
a
different
provision
and
so,
supreme
court,
why
don't
you
rewrite
it
for
congress,
because
they
surely
would
have
put
it
this
way
if
they
had
known
then
what
we
know
now.
do
you
know
any
case
where
we've
done
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
they
saw
a
symmetry
which
now
no
longer
exists
because
we've
given
the
first
part
a
much
broader
meaning,
and
now
this
other
part,
which
they
once
thought
was
symmetrical,
is
no
longer
symmetrical,
so
now
we
should
read
it
to
mean
something
more--
justice
antonin
scalia
--than
a
class
of
workers
engaged
in
foreign
or
interstate
commerce.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
when
it
doesn't
achieve
that
by
reason
of
future
changes,
future
changes
in
the
law,
or
future
changes
in
circumstances.
what
you're
asking
us
to
do
is,
in
light
of
future
changes
in
the
law,
make
this
statute
read
the
way
congress
thought
it
was
going
to
operate
when
it
was
enacted,
but
we
don't
usually
do
that.
if,
in
fact,
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
is
something
narrower
and
is
no
longer
symmetrical,
tough
luck.
congress
can
amend
it.
but
we
don't
go
around
rewriting
it
in
order
to
preserve
symmetry.
