justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
you
are
talking
about
all
workers,
a
lot
of
water
has
flowed
over
the
dam
or
under
the
bridge
since
1925.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
just
would
like
to
focus,
you
to
focus
for
a
minute
on
the
consequences.
one
of
the
things
that's
strongest
for
you
is
that
in
all
the
other
circuits
but
the
ninth,
for
a
long
time
have
limited
to
transportation
workers
this
exemption.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
bad
would
happen
if
we
bought
the
ninth
circuit?
that
is,
in
thinking
about
it,
i
thought
that
the
purpose
of
this
act
is
to
stop
state
court
hostility
to
arbitration.
isn't
that
the
basic
idea?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
if
we
read
workers
out
of
it
you
still
have
the
nlrb
there
today,
and
doesn't
the
nlrb
have
the
power
today
to
protect
any
worker,
just...
you
wouldn't
need
this...
to
protect
them
because
the
nlrb
operating
under
section
301,
or
just
its
general
power,
could
protect
all
these
workers
adequately,
and
therefore
there's
no
reason
not
to
read
them
out
and
to
invent
distinctions
between
transportation
and
other
kinds
of
worker.
now,
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
who
wouldn't
they
have
power
to
protect?
who
wouldn't
they
have
power...
if
the
states
become
unreasonable
in
respect
to
arbitration,
i.e.,
they
stop
enforcing
arbitration
agreements
with
workers,
couldn't
the
nlrb
come
right
in
there
and
say,
don't
be
unreasonable,
we
want
the
right
rules
here,
and
we'll
both
get
the
arbitration
and
protect
the
workers?
is
there
anyone
on...
in
other
words,
on
the
ninth
circuit
interpretation,
that's
somehow
going
to
be
left
out
in
the
cold
when
they
want
an
arbitration
agreement?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i'm
interested
in
a
practical
fact.
this
statute
is
to
stop
the
hostility
of
the
states
to
arbitration.
i
wouldn't
want
workers
who
wanted
arbitration
to
be
left
out
in
the
cold,
any
more
than
anybody
else,
and
then
i
thought,
well,
if
we
accept
the
ninth
circuit
they're
not
going
to
be
left
out
in
the
cold,
because
they
have
the
nlrb
in
there
to
protect
them
and,
moreover,
it
will
help
them
somewhat
in
terms
of
the
purposes
because
they
won't
get
these
agreements
shoved
in
their
face
and
they
will
be
able
perhaps
to
have
more
freedom
to
choose.
but
i'm
not...
i'm
not
expressing
a
view
on
that.
whatever
the
right
thing
is,
we
have
people
there
on
the
board
to
protect
them.
that's...
so
in
other
words,
if
i
deny
your
interpretation,
am
i
causing
any
harm?
leaving
the
words
out
of
it,
i
want
to
know
the
consequences.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
because
you'd
say
that
it
covers
workers,
and
workers
might
have
had
a
definition
at
the
time
that
did
not
include
the
ceo.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
don't
have
to
decide
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
true
that
all
the
other
circuits
but
the
ninth
have
restricted
this
to
transportation
workers?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
all
right,
but
i
mean,
restricted
it,
then
it
can't
be
that
there
are
a
lot
of
circuits
that
have
held
that
collective
bargaining
agreements
are
excluded
as
a
contract
of
other
workers.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
the
consistency
there,
but
i
need...
that
isn't
your
problem
at
the
moment,
nor
mine.
the
question
i
have
is
the
same
i
addressed
to
your
brother
over...
as
i
understand
it...
this
is
75
years
ago.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
an
old
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it's
possible
the
language
is
open
and,
given
that
possibility,
i'd
like
to
know
what
the
consequence
is.
as
far
as
i
understand
it,
when
i'm
focusing
on
workers...
and
i
believe
there
still
is
hostility
to
arbitration
in
the
states,
and
i
also
think
that
there
are
a
lot
of
unfair
arbitration
agreements,
but
there
are
even
more
that
are
fair
and
many
of
them
help
the
average
worker,
maybe
not
your
client.
all
right.
given
that
background,
who's
going
to
be
left
out
in
the
cold?
are
there
a
class
of
workers
such
that
if
we
accept
the
ninth
circuit
they
will
suddenly
not
be
able
to
get
arbitration
agreements
that
might
help
them
because
of
state
hostility
or
complex
state
rules,
et
cetera?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
the
nlra,
nlrb
take
jurisdiction
over
such
a
class?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
a
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
response
is,
then,
look,
they
can
still
agree,
just
not
in
the
employment
contract.
