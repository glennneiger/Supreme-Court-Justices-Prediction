mr.
david
e.
nagle
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
federal
arbitration
act
is
a
declaration
of
federal
policy
favoring
arbitration,
arbitration
agreements,
and
its
coverage
extends
to
the
very
limits
of
congress'
commerce
clause
power.
there's
an
exception
to
the
act,
the
scope
of
which
is
in
dispute
today.
the
respondent
asserts
that
all
contracts
of
employment
are
excluded
from
the
coverage
of
the
act.
that
simply
cannot
be
correct.
the
act
does
not
say
that
it
excludes
all
contracts
of
employment.
section
1
excludes
only
certain
kinds
of
employment
contracts,
the
contracts
of
employment
of
seamen,
railroad
employees,
any
other
class
of
workers
engaged
in
foreign
or
interstate
commerce.
beginning
nearly
50
years
ago,
11
courts
of
appeals
have
read
that
text
in
a
uniform,
consistent
manner,
finding
it
to
create
a
narrow
exclusion
applicable
only
to
those
workers
who
are
actually
engaged
in
the
movement
of
people
or
goods
across
state
lines,
and
we
contend
that
that's
the
only
interpretation
consistent
with
the
text
of
the
statute.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
your
honor--
mr.
david
e.
nagle
--i
do
not
believe
that
it
significantly
alters
it.
i
think
the
class
is
a
term
which
is
used
in
the
railway
labor
act,
for
instance,
which
was
under
consideration
and
passed
the
following
year
to
refer
to
categories
of
craft
or
class
of
employees.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
oh,
certainly,
your
honor.
it
identifies
a
group
or
a
category
of
employees
in
the
same
manner
that
seamen
and
railroad
employees
are
grouped.
seamen,
of
course,
was
a
recognized
term.
as
the
opinion
of
the
court...
as
justice
o'connor's
opinion
for
the
court
in
mcdermott
international
recognized,
seamen
was
a
term
having
specific
meaning.
railroad
employees
was
a
term
defined
under
the
transportation
act
of
1920
and
also
in
the
railway
labor
act,
so--
mr.
david
e.
nagle
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
i
would
acknowledge
that,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
they
were
specifying
seamen
and
railroad
employees.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
well,
there
are
several
points
in
response,
your
honor.
first,
the
letter
from
secretary
hoover
was
a
letter
submitted
to
the
committee
in
1923,
written
on
the
day
that
it
was
entered,
and
there
was
no
further
explanation.
i
would
also
submit
that
we
need
to
look
to
the
language
of
the
coverage
provision,
section
2
of
the
act,
and
contrast
that
with
the
language
contained
in
section
1
of
the
act.
i
acknowledge
that
commerce
clause
authority
over
seamen
and
railroad
employees
would
have
been
clear,
but
i
would
also
point...
bring
to
the
court's
attention,
of
course,
the
fact
that
there
were
statutory
mechanisms
in
place,
and
also
the
single
item
that
we
know
most
clearly
is
that
the
seamen
as
a
group,
through
their
representative,
mr.
bruce,
have
specifically
asked
that
they
be
carved
out.
while
it
may
be
somewhat
difficult
to
determine
exactly
what
congress'
motive
was,
they
were
responding
to
a
request
from
a
constituency
group
to
be
carved
out.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
well,
in
allied
bruce,
which
is
one
of
the
cases
upon
which
we
would
principally
rely,
that
was
an
interpretation
of
section
2,
the
coverage,
and
certainly
was
making
it
clear
that
the
court
recognized
that
congress
was
acting
to
the
full
with
respect
to
its
commerce
clause
power.
section
1
is
an
exclusion.
it
is
to
be
narrowly
construed.
i
would
submit
that
there
is
a
general
policy
that
whenever
we
have
a
statute
which
clearly
enunciates
a
public
policy
of
broad
scope
that
any
exclusion
to
that
should
be
narrowly
construed.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
i
certainly
would
not
suggest
that--
mr.
david
e.
nagle
--i
apologize,
your
honor.
i
was
not
suggesting
that
we
take
an
unreasonable
meaning.
in
fact,
i'm
suggesting
that
we
take
the
most
reasonable
construction
that
congress--
mr.
david
e.
nagle
--absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
i
would
point
the
court
first
to...
for
contemporaneous
construction
of
the
language
i
would
point
the
court
to
illinois
central
railroad
v.
behrens,
a
1914
case,
where
the
congress
clearly
recognized...
the
court
clearly
recognized
that
the
congress
had
very
broad
authority
under
the
fela
statute
over
interstate
commerce,
recognized
that
even
trains,
for
instance,
moving
in
intrastate
commerce
were
nevertheless
in
the
channels
of
commerce,
and
so
when
the
fela
in
1914
limited
its
coverage
to
an
employee
who
was
injured
while
employed
in
commerce,
this
court
found
that
that
was
a
narrower
construction--
mr.
david
e.
nagle
--yes.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
to
my
knowledge
it
is,
and
that's
what
the
court
indicated
in
the
allied
bruce
decision.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
in
involving
commerce
says,
as
this
court
found
in
allied
bruce,
that
it's
the
functional
equivalent
of
affecting
commerce,
which
is--
mr.
david
e.
nagle
--involving
commerce,
in
section
2,
the
coverage.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
i...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i'm
not
using
the
phrase,
involved
in--
mr.
david
e.
nagle
--yes,
your
honor.
i'm
not
aware
that
involved--
mr.
david
e.
nagle
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
your
honor,
i--
mr.
david
e.
nagle
--i
am
not
referring
to
the
phrase,
involved
in
commerce.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
section
2,
yes.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
yes.
section
1's
exclusion
is
for
contracts
of
employment
of
seamen,
railroad
employees,
and
other
workers
engaged
in
commerce.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
as
your
honor
has
recognized,
they
did
not
use
involved
in.
that
perhaps
would
have
supported
mr.
adams'
argument
that
they
were
trying
to
show
parallel
construction.
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
fact
that
the
congress
could
have
ended
with
the
phrase,
contracts
of
employment,
then
we
would
not
be
here
today
if
that
was
their
intent,
or
could
have
used
parallel
language,
which
would
have
supported
respondent's
suggestion
that
they
had
the
same
meaning.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
i
would
not,
your
honor,
because
if
section
2
is
the
coverage
provision
and
congress
was
making
reference
to
its
commerce
clause
power
in
coverage,
there
would
certainly
be
no
reason
for
them
to
make
reference
to
or
be
concerned
by
the
limits
of
their
commerce
clause
power
in
drafting
an
exclusion
from
the
statute.
if
they
had--
mr.
david
e.
nagle
--i
would
point
to
judge
posner's
opinion
in
the
pryner
case
out
of
the
seventh
circuit,
in
which
he
concluded
that
the
seventh
circuit
concluded
in
his
opinion
that
this
section
1
exclusion
should
be
narrow.
he
pointed
again
to
the
advocacy
of
the
seamen's
union,
and
the
recognition
that
they
were
a
heavily
regulated
industry
that
already
had
a
statute
in
place
that
provided
for
an
administrative
process
for
resolution
of
disputes.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
his...
judge
posner's
suggestion
is
that
the
railroad
industry,
the
railway
labor
act
was
in
the
works
at
the
time.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
it
was
also
a
similarly
heavily
regulated--
mr.
david
e.
nagle
--heavily
unionized
industry,
and
judge
posner's
opinion
goes
on
that
congress
may
have
anticipated,
quite
correctly,
that
motor
carriers
would
also
become
a
heavily
regulated
industry,
and
in
the--
mr.
david
e.
nagle
--travel
agents,
i
would...
under
our
interpretation
i
do
not
believe
that
they
would
be
covered
because
they're
not
engaged--
mr.
david
e.
nagle
--railroad
employees,
to
the
extent
that
they
fall
within
the
definition
of
employee,
for
instance,
under
the
railway
labor
act,
i
would
submit
that
because
railroad
employees
is
a...
or
employees
is
a
term
under
that
statute,
which
includes
various
employees--
mr.
david
e.
nagle
--i
draw
a
distinction--
mr.
david
e.
nagle
--i
draw
the
distinction
because
congress
specifically
referred
to
railroad
employees.
when
we
get
into
travel
agents...
and
i
apologize
if
you
were
saying
employees
of
railroads
who
are
travel
agents,
but
i
think--
mr.
david
e.
nagle
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
yes,
your
honor.
certainly,
in
trying
to
read
the
statute--
mr.
david
e.
nagle
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
i
would
acknowledge
that
in
order
to
determine
the
meaning
of
the
final
phrase
there,
any
other
class
of
workers
engaged
in
foreign
or
interstate
commerce,
that
we
need
to...
that
we
need
primarily
to
recognize
the
doctrine
of
ejusdem
generis,
and
the
fact
that
it
does
follow
after
the
references
to
seamen
and
railroad
employees.
they
are
specific
groups
in
a
list.
they
certainly
have
something
in
common,
that
being
that
they
are
transportation
workers,
and
i
would
also
submit
that
it's
inappropriate
to
read
a
statute
to
eliminate
the
reference
to
seamen
and
railroad
employees.
if
reading
it
as
respondent
contends,
it's
essentially
an
exclusion
for
all
contracts
of
employment
of
all
workers
engaged
in
foreign
or
interstate
commerce,
and
that's,
as
judge
edwards
said
in
the
cole
v.
burns
security
case--
mr.
david
e.
nagle
--i
simply
don't
think
that
that
conforms
with
the
statute.
if
we
are
just
reading
the
exclusion,
congress
has...
section
2,
the
coverage
is
very
broad,
using
the
language
to
demonstrate
the
breadth
of
coverage.
the
exclusion
is
very
narrow,
and
if
one
chooses
to
look
to
the
legislative
history
that
mr.
adams
and
his
amici
point
to,
there's
very,
very
limited
legislative
history.
there's
essentially
one
hearing
before
a
senate
committee
in
1923
with
three
senators
present.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
your
honor,
i'm
not
aware
of
cases
that
in
1925
would
have
said,
engaged
in
commerce
would
go
beyond
transportation
workers.
i
think
that
involving
commerce
would...
the
section
2
language
goes
to
the
breadth
of
it,
but
in
commerce,
this
court,
as
i
mentioned,
illinois
central
railroad
case,
the
gulf
oil
corporation
case,
the
bunte
brothers
case,
in
each
of
those
the
court
said
that
in
commerce
is
not
the
equivalent
of
affecting
commerce.
in
the
bunte
brothers
case
the
court
said,
words
derive
vitality
from
the
aim
and
nature
of
the
specific
legislation.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
they
would
not
have
been
included
as
engaged
in
commerce.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
in
the
movement
of
people
and
goods
across
state
lines,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
i
would
disagree,
your
honor,
in...
with
respect
to
the
example
that
justice
ginsburg
just
gave,
with
respect
to
telephone,
telegraph
workers.
in
1877
this
court
in
the
pensacola
telegraph
case
had
found
that
telephone
telegraph
workers
affected
commerce,
were
involved
in
commerce,
but
they
were
not
engaged
in
commerce
in
that
they
were
not
actually
moving
goods...
certainly
we
would
acknowledge
that
telephone
operators
were
not
moving
goods
across
state
lines.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
well,
certainly
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
labor
management
relations
act
come
into
play
in
the
collective
bargaining
context.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
your
honor,
certainly
the
ninth
circuit
started
its
analysis
in
the
craft
case,
which
was
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
case--
mr.
david
e.
nagle
--the
consequences,
your
honor,
is
that
arbitration
and
the
federal
policy
favoring
arbitration,
which
is
designed
to
reduce
litigation,
will
lead
to
a
period
of
tremendous
turmoil
while
the
courts
are
trying
to
grapple
with
the
application
and
enforcement
of
arbitration
agreements.
the
extent
to
which
they're
enforceable
under
various
laws,
choice
of
law
provisions,
when
arbitration
agreements
contain
a
governing
law
provision,
the
question
that
i
think
is
very
significant,
although
it's
only
mentioned
in
mr.
adams'
brief
in
footnote
19,
the
question
of
arbitrability
of
federal
employment
statutes,
if
the
faa
is
taken
out
of
the
mix,
where
this
court
relied
in
part
on
the
liberal
federal
policy
favoring
arbitration
in
gilmer
and
used
that
to...
as
a
consideration
with
respect
to
enforcement
of
arbitration
agreements,
if
the
faa
is
taken
out
of
the
mix,
i
think
note
19
in
adams'
brief
suggests
that
there's
an
effort
to
avoid
arbitration
of
even
the
federal
claims,
and--
mr.
david
e.
nagle
--there
are
state
arbitration
rules
which
vary
dramatically
from
state
to
state,
your
honor,
certainly.
that
i
think
does
not
solve
the
issue,
because,
as
this
court
has
recognized
on
a
number
of
occasions,
one
of
the
great
advantages
of
the
broad
application
of
the
faa
is
providing
that
substantive
law
of
arbitrability.
if
we
are
to
revert
back
to
the
state
substantive
law
of
arbitrability,
we
will
have
the
determinations
made
on
various
statutes,
we'll
have
the
issues
that
arise
when
a
contract
arbitration
agreement
is
entered
into
in
one
state,
performed
in
a
third,
a
claim
is
brought
in
a
third,
we'll
have
removal
to
federal
court
and
a
question
of
which
state
substantive
statute
on
arbitrability--
mr.
david
e.
nagle
--in...
there
may
be
cases
where
there
is
diversity,
just
a--
mr.
david
e.
nagle
--i
would
disagree,
your
honor.
i
think
there
are
many
large
national
corporations
that...
such
as
circuit
city
which
is
primarily...
principal
place
of
business
is
in
virginia,
and
so
to
the
extent
that
large
companies
have
employees
in
many
states
there
may
very
well
be
diversity,
and
then
when
the
matter
is
removed
on
diversity
grounds
there
will
be
the
question
as
to
which
state
substantive
law
of
arbitrability
would
apply.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
well,
it
may
be,
your
honor.
on
some
occasions
this
court
has
had
arbitration
agreements
such
as
in
allied
bruce,
where
it
was
essentially
one
sentence
in
a
termite
prevention
contract.
a
number
of
employers
since
gilmer,
and
in
reliance
on
gilmer,
have
developed
very
sophisticated
arbitration
programs
which
include,
among
other
things,
governing
law
provisions,
and
so
you
may
have
a
corporation
which
is
based
in
one
state,
has
a
detailed
arbitration
rules
and
procedures,
as
circuit
city
does--
mr.
david
e.
nagle
--it
will
be
some
state
law.
one
of
the
issues
that
the
courts
will
need
to
determine
is
when
we
have
a
governing
law
provision
such
as
in
the
circuit
city
agreement,
specifying
that
the
virginia
uniform
arbitration
act
would
apply,
and
then
the
question
will
arise
whether,
for
instance,
california
would
honor
that
reference
to
that
state
statute.
i
think
it's
simply
an
issue
that
the
courts
will
have
to
grapple
with
for
a
number
of
years
until
someone
returns
here
on
that
issue.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
your
honor,
i
didn't
hear
the
beginning.
are
you
saying
in
1925--
mr.
david
e.
nagle
--would
it
have
been
customary?
mr.
david
e.
nagle
it
was
an
administrative
machinery
that
was
put
in
place.
i
cannot
represent
to
the
court
that
it
would
have
been
customary
on
that.
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
illinois
central
railroad
v.
behrens,
the
shanks
v.
delaware,
the
railroad
case.
those
are
pre
faa
cases.
certainly
subsequent
interpretation,
if
you
look
at
bunte
brothers
case,
which
was
involving...
i'm
sorry.
in
commerce
was
not
equivalent
to
affecting
commerce.
it
was
sometime
later,
but
it
referred
to
the
clayton
act,
which
had
been
passed
in
1908.
in
fact,
another
point
to
note
on
that
case
is
that
they
noted
where
it
was
reenacted
in
1950,
and
that
congress
did
not
change
the
language,
despite
the
fact
that
this
court
had
made
clear
there
was
a
difference
between
in
commerce
and
affecting
commerce.
the
reenactment
without
change
seemed
to
suggest
that
congress
had
acquiesced
in
that.
i
would
point
out
that
the
federal
arbitration
act
was
reenacted
in
1949
without
change,
after
the
law
had
become
quite
clear
over
that
respect.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
i
would
say
that
while
congress'
motives
are
not
always
clear,
and
the
very
limited
legislative
history
doesn't
provide
any
guidance
on
that,
what
we
know
is
that
mr.
furiceff
of
the
seamen's
union
specifically
asked
that
his
union
be
carved
out.
we
know
that
seamen
and
railroad
employees
were
groups
that
already
had
by
statute
an
administrative
mechanism
for
resolution
of
disputes.
pryner
and
asplundh
tree
both
point
out
that
they
were
heavily
regulated,
and
that
there...
i
would
conclude,
if
i
could,
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
suggest
that
congress
was
contemplating
the
scope
of
its
authority
when
it
crafted
the
words
in
section
1.
if
i
may
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
thank
you.
very
briefly,
first,
with
respect
to
the
particular
questions
that
have
arisen
regarding
our
citation
of
behrens,
i
would
ask
the
court
to
look
at
the
sections
on
pages
7
and
8
of
our
reply
brief,
where
we
specifically
tried
to
address
that
the
1925
congress
that
had
used
the
words,
engaging
in
interstate
commerce,
that...
i'm
sorry,
with
respect
to
behrens,
had
indicated
that
that
applied
only
to
employees
who
were
actually
engaged
in
interstate
transportation
or
closely
related
functions,
and
not
to
other
employees
that
congress
had
the
constitutional
authority
to
regulate.
mr.
david
e.
nagle
yes,
your
honor.
with
respect
to
the
questions
on
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act,
that,
of
course,
affects
those
in
the
unionized
context.
i
would
note,
as
justice
scalia
had
pointed
out,
that
this
would
lead
to
the
anomalous
result
that
a
ceo
of
a
multinational
corporation
who
has
an
arbitration
provision
in
his
or
her
employment
contract,
that
it
would
not
be
enforceable
pursuant
to
the
faa.
i
would
note
that
in
prima
paint,
at
note
7,
the
court
made
reference...
albeit
it
in
dicta
the
court
made
reference
to
certain
kinds
of
employment
contracts
being
excluded
under
section
1,
which
is
consistent
with
our
view
that
it
was
not
intended
to
cover
the
entire
range
of
that
which
was
covered.
ultimately,
i
would
suggest
that
as
the
court
of
appeals
have
consistently
held,
the
narrow
reading
of
section
1
is
the
only
reason
which
is
based
on
and
consistent
with
the
text,
that
makes
use
of
the
full
text
and
conforms
with
the
principles
of
statutory
construction,
so
that
we
don't
read
words
to
be
meaningless
and
that
we
do
apply
the
canon
of
ejusdem
generis.
as
this
court
noted
in
allied
bruce,
and
particularly
in
justice
o'connor's
concurring
opinion
there,
there's
value
in
uniformity
and
stability
of
the
case
law
which
has
developed.
since
gilmer,
untold
number
of
agreements
to
arbitrate
employment
claims
have
been
entered
into
in
reliance,
and
i
would
suggest
that
congress
is
certainly
well
aware
of
this
case
law
development,
has
had
the
opportunity
to
correct
it
if
they
thought
the
court
had
gotten
it
wrong,
and
they
have
declined
to
do
so.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
