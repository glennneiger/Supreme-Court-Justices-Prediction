--mr.
nagle,
i
guess
at
the
time
that
this
act
was
adopted
in...
what,
1925?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
had
not
taken
as
broad
a
view
of
the
commerce
clause
power
as
is
true
today,
is
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
congress
probably
didn't
have
in
mind
that
its
jurisdiction
was
as
broad
as
we
would
have
subsequently
indicated,
and
apparently
it
intended
at
least
that
the
act
not
include
or
cover
contracts
of
employment
over
which
their
authority
to
regulate
was
very
clear,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
indications
were
that
at
least
then
secretary
of
commerce
hoover
thought
employees
shouldn't
be
covered
at
all,
and
he
presented
language
to
the
congress
which
approved
it,
and
yet
you
want
us
to
say
that
congress
did
intend
to
include
for
arbitration
contracts
of
employment
over
which
the
jurisdiction
was
most
questionable,
and
yet
exclude
it
for
those
where
the
jurisdiction
of
congress
was
clearest
at
the
time,
which
seems
a
little
odd
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
other
most
troublesome
point
for
me,
anyway,
is
this
court's
decision
in
allied
bruce,
which
dealt
with
section
2,
and
said
that
we're
going
to
interpret
it
now
as
reaching
the
full
scope
of
congress'
commerce
clause
power.
why
would
we
not
do
the
same
for
this
section
1?
justice
sandra
day

in

justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
rubin,
what
was
well
established
as
of
1925
about
the
meaning
of
congress'
power?
was
it
well
established
that
engaged
in
commerce
was
narrower
than
congress'
full
power?
was
there
already
the
affecting
commerce
notion--

--floating
out
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
the
case
cited
by
opposing
counsel,
behrens.
