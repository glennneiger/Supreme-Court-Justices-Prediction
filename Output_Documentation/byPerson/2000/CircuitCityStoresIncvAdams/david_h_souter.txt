david
h.
souter
well,
can
you
give
us
a
better
explanation?
i
mean,
this
goes
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question
about
the
oddity
of
an
exclusion
which
excluded
those
contracts
which
were
most
obviously
at
the
time
of
drafting
within
the
congressional
power,
without
touching
those
as
to
which
the
power
was
doubtful,
or
perhaps
absent,
and
as
i
understood
your
answer,
your
answer
was
a
suggestion
that
perhaps
politics
was
simply
the
answer.
i
mean,
the
one
particular
political
group
had
asked
for
it.
can
you
think
of
any
other
reason
to
draw
what
to
me
also
seems
like
an
odd
distinction
in
the
congressional
mind?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
didn't
they
just
stop
with
seamen?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
if
that's
the
case,
then
i
think
what
we're
faced
with
on
your
own
interpretation
is
an
exclusion
which
is
as
complete
in
relation
to
the
coverage
of
employees
as
the
inclusion
at
the
beginning
of
the
provision
is
in
relation
to
commerce
in
general,
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
supports
the
interpretive
theory
that
congress
was,
in
fact,
in
each
instance,
in
the
coverage
and
in
the
exclusion,
legislating
to
the
limits,
and
if
the
limits
change
as
to
the
one,
we
ought
to
recognize
a
change
in
the
limits
as
to
the
other.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
nagle,
at
the
time
this...
the
exclusion
was
passed,
can
you
tell
me
whether
it
was
customary
to
require
each
party
to
bear
a
portion
of
the
cost
of
the
arbitration,
so
was
it...
would
it
have
been
customary
at
that
time
to
require
employees
to
pay
part
of
the
up
front
arbitration
costs?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
some
of
the
examples
involve
collective
bargaining
agreements
outside
of
the
transportation
industry.
