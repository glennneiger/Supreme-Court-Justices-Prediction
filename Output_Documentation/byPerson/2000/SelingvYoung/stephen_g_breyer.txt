justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
that
he
makes
out
his
claim.
suppose
he
proves
what
he's
trying
to
prove.
suppose
he
proves
that
there's
virtually
no
treatment
for
people
who
could
benefit
by
it,
that
it's
virtually
impossible
to
be
released
to
half
way
houses
even
though
certain
medical
people
would
say
he
was
safe
enough
for
that.
he
proves
that
it's
being
run
by
prison
officials
for
the
most
part,
and
not
by
mental
health
officials,
and
that
really
there
isn't
much
segregation
from
the
general
prison
population,
and
they
don't
seem
to
have
the
status
of
ordinary
mentally
ill
people
confined
for
civil
purposes.
assume
he
proves
that,
would
that
then
violate
the
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it
would
violate
the
statute.
so
you've
read
his
claims,
and
you're
saying
that
if
he
proves
what
he
says
he's
going
to
prove,
then
the
conditions
violate
washington's
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
i'd
like
a
yes
or
no
answer
to
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
so,
i
take
it...
and
this
is
just
an
elaboration
of
what
i
asked
you
before.
i
don't
know
if
you're
familiar
enough
with
hendrix
to
refer
to
it
by
page
number,
but
at
the
end,
on
page
368,
the
court
sums
up
the
factors
in
the
statute
that
make
it
civil,
and
they
include
things,
to
bring
it
to
your
mind,
the
state's
disavowed
any
punitive
intent,
it's
limited
its
confinement
to
a
small
segment,
and
particularly...
there
are
procedural
safeguards,
they're
segregated,
they
have
the
same
status
as
the
other
civilly
committed,
recommended
treatment
is
possible,
et
cetera.
does
that
call
to
mind
the
paragraph
that
you're
probably
familiar
with?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
insofar
as
the
facts
in
a
particular
case
don't
meet
them,
they
violate
the
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
it's
important
they
be
interpreted
the
same
way.
they...
the
majority
interpreted
that
statute
in
kansas
to
require
certain
things,
like
adequate
treatment,
and
i
take
it...
at
least
that's
how
i
read
it.
that's...
the
words
are
there,
and
the...
so...
it's
important
to
me
that
you're
saying
that
if
those
are
not
being
given
in
fact,
then
the
remedy
for
the
prisoner
is
to
sue
under
the
state
law
and
say,
this
is
what
the
state
law
means,
and
i'm
not
getting
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
obviously,
the
word
isn't
applied.
that's
the
wrong
concept,
i
would
have
thought,
that
the
conditions
in
an
individual
case
show
what
the
statute
may
or
may
not
permit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
they
permit
no
treatment,
then,
of
course,
everybody
i
think
concedes...
i
don't
know
if
everybody
does,
but
i'd
say
then
it's
unconstitutional.
but
the
difficulty
here
right
now,
i
think,
is
the
majority's
opinion
in
hendrix
is
the
law.
the
majority
listed
certain
features
of
this
case...
hendrix...
which
made
it
civil
and
not
criminal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
you've
heard
the
attorney
general
say,
and
i
guess
what's
important
is
that
your
client
have
some
remedy,
that
he
does
have
a
remedy.
that's
what's
important,
and
the
remedy
is
that
those
conditions
that
made
the
hendrix
statute
civil
do
not
pertain
to
your
client,
then
the
law
of
washington
is
violated,
and
therefore
your
client
has
an
excellent
remedy.
either
the
hendrix
majority
conditions
apply,
or
they
do
not.
if
they
do
apply,
you
can't
complain...
on
my...
i
was
in
dissent.
but
if
they
don't
apply...
if
they
don't
apply,
well
then,
you
have
a
perfect
remedy,
so
what's
the
problem
with
that,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
why
i'm
confused
on
the
procedure.
i
would
think
the
answer
to
justice
souter's
question,
i
mean,
at
least
as
i
would
see
it,
would
be
you
have
a
civil
statute,
but
this
person
is
suffering
criminal
treatment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
i'd
say
if
that's
so,
of
course
he
must
have
a
remedy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
saying
he
does
have.
he
has
two
remedies.
you
don't
need
to
create
a
new
category.
the
first
remedy
would
be,
under
state
law...
it
violates
the
statute,
and
then
if
you
lose
on
that
one,
there
would
be
another,
which
would
say
that
the
federal
constitution
doesn't
permit
a
person
who
is
civilly
committed
to
be
there
without
any
treatment,
where
he
can
sustain
the
treatment,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
and
that
would
be
the
federal
constitutional
claim.
you
might
win,
you
might
lose,
but
it
seems
to
me
you
have
those
already
in
the
lower
courts,
and
we
don't
need
a
remand
on
this
case
to
give
you
those.
that's
where
i'm
confused.
i
mean,
they're
already
pending,
those
two
claims.
one's
in
the
washington
system,
the
other's
in
the
federal
system,
and
so
what's
this
thing
now
going
to
help
on?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that
sounds
a
lot
like
my
dissent,
which
the
lower
courts,
as
much
as
i'd
like
them
to
follow
my
dissents
rather
than
the
majority,
i'm
afraid,
quite
correctly,
they
follow
the
majority
opinions,
not
the
dissents
and
that's
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
how
do
we
reconcile
that
with...
i
mean,
it's
the
majority--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
going
to
the
same
judge
who's
handling
the
other
federal
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
just
seems
to
me
this
is
going
to
be
exactly
the
same
issue.
if
we
just
let
it
alone,
it
would
have
gone
back
to
the
judge.
the
judge
would
have
either
said,
you're
right,
the
conditions
are
terrible,
you're
not
getting
any
treatment,
in
which
case
you
would
have
had
three
separate
grounds
for
getting
the
relief,
but
you
would
have
gotten
it,
or
you're
wrong,
in
which
case
you'd
be
out,
and
i
don't
really...
now,
see,
what
we're
deciding,
we're
deciding
whether
this
judge
should
do
it
or
that
judge
should
do
it,
and
the
standards
seem
to
me
to
be
roughly
the
same.
i
just
don't...
and
then
the
consequence
is
the
same.
