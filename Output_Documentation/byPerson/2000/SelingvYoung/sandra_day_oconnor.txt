ms.
hart,
i
suppose
you
could
have
a
situation
where
on
habeas
some
prisoner,
some
person
being
held
under
a
statutory
scheme
of
this
type
could
come
in
and
say,
on
federal
habeas,
i'm
being
held
under
circumstances
that
violate
the
constitution,
and
make
an
individual
challenge,
isn't
that
so?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
is
that
what
this
person
is
doing,
or
is
there
something
different?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
there
is
an
ongoing
1983
class
action,
is
there,
covering
this
very
facility?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
under
that
action,
presumably
this
respondent
would
be
affected
by
the
outcome
of
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
washington
state's
community
protection
act
of
1990
authorizes
the
civil
commitment
of
"sexually
violent
predators,"
that
is
persons
who
suffer
from
a
mental
abnormality
or
personality
disorder
that
makes
them
likely
to
engage
in
predatory
acts
of
sexual
violence.
respondent,
andre
brigham
young,
is
confined
in
washington
as
a
sexually
violent
predator
at
the
special
commitment
center.
petitioner,
marc
seling
is
the
superintendent
of
that
facility.
in
1993,
the
washington
supreme
court
held
that
the
act
is
civil,
designed
to
incapacitate
and
to
treat.
after
the
respondent
unsuccessfully
challenged
his
commitment
in
state
court,
he
started
a
habeas
corpus
action
in
federal
court
seeking
release
from
confinement.
among
other
claims,
he
contended
that
his
confinement
violated
the
double
jeopardy
and
the
ex
post
facto
clauses
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
district
court
rejected
those
claims
because
the
washington
act
is
civil
not
punitive.
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed
that
ruling.
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledged
that
the
washington
act
is
civil,
but
reasoned
that
the
‘linchpin’
of
respondent’s
double
jeopardy
and
ex
post
facto
claims
was
whether
the
act
was
punitive
as
applied
to
him.
the
court
concluded
that
if
the
respondent
could
prove
his
allegations
about
the
treatment
regime
and
conditions
of
confinement
at
the
center,
he
would
establish
that
the
washington
act
is
punitive
as
applied
to
him.
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
an
evidentiary
hearing.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
four
terms
ago
in
kansas
versus
hendricks,
we
reviewed
a
confinement
scheme
very
similar
to
the
washington
act.
in
hendricks,
we
explained
that
the
question
whether
an
act
is
civil
or
punitive
in
nature
is
initially
one
of
statutory
construction.
a
court
must
ascertain
whether
the
legislature
intended
the
act
to
establish
civil
proceedings.
a
court
will
reject
the
legislature’s
intent
only
where
a
party
challenging
the
act
provides
the
clearest
proof
that
the
act
is
punitive
in
either
purpose
or
effect.
we
concluded
in
the
hendricks’
case
that
the
person
confined
there
had
failed
to
satisfy
his
burden.
in
the
next
term,
in
a
case
called
hudson
versus
united
states,
this
court
expressly
disapproved
of
evaluating
the
civil
nature
of
an
act
by
reference
to
the
effect
the
act
has
on
a
single
individual.
in
considering
the
respondent’s
challenge
in
this
case,
we
proceed
then
on
the
understanding
that
the
washington
act
is
civil
as
the
washington
supreme
court
held
and
as
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
acknowledged.
we
hold
that
the
respondent
cannot
obtain
release
through
an
as
applied
challenged
to
the
act
on
double
jeopardy
and
ex
post
facto
grounds.
we
agree
with
the
petitioner
that
an
as-applied
analysis
would
prove
unworkable.
such
an
analysis
would
never
resolve
whether
an
act
is
punitive
and
would
prevent
a
final
determination
of
the
act’s
validity
under
the
double
jeopardy
and
the
ex
post
facto
clauses.
our
decision
today
does
not
mean
that
that
the
respondent
and
others
committed
as
sexually
violent
predators
have
no
remedy
for
the
alleged
conditions
at
the
center.
under
state
law,
persons
confined
have
a
right
to
adequate
care
and
individualized
treatment.
in
addition,
the
washington
supreme
court
has
held
that
the
washington
act
is
civil
and
designed
to
incapacitate
and
to
treat.
so,
due
process
requires
that
the
conditions
and
the
duration
of
confinement
under
the
act
bear
some
reasonable
relation
to
the
purposes
of
confinement.
finally,
we
note
that
there
is
a
section
1983
action
against
the
center
that
is
pending
in
the
federal
district
court
in
that
state.
the
center
is
operating
under
an
injunction
at
present
that
requires
it
to
improve
the
conditions
of
confinement
and
treatment
there.

scalia

concurring
opinion

justice
souter

thomas

concurring

the
judgment;
