justice
john
paul
stevens
does
this
statute
make
that
representation,
that
it's
confining
him
for
treatment,
or
does
it
simply
talk
about
the
abnormality,
mental
abnormality?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
may
i
just
ask
this
question.
if
he's
correct
that
as
applied
to
him
it's
punitive,
then
does
that
not
mean
that
he's
been
subjected
to
double
jeopardy
and
is
entitled
to
his
release?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
on
that
point,
are
you
contending...
is
it
your
view
that
you
have
to
prove
that
everyone
subject
to
this
statute
is
being
punished,
or
just
that
your
client
is
being
punished?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if
there
are
100
people
in
prison,
99
of
them
are
civil,
and
your
client
is
punished?
that
would...
he
would
get
relief,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
there
are
remedies
for
those
things.
i
mean,
those
are
independent
constitutional
violations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it
would
seem
to
me
your
case
would
be
very
strong
if
you
could
say
everybody
who's
subject
to
this
statute
is
being
punished,
but
you
don't
go
that
far.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
be
open
on
remand,
under
your
understanding
of
the
mandate,
for
you
to
try
to
prove
what
i've
just
suggested?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
answer
the
question
i...
supposing
he
proves
that
everybody
who's
been
committed
pursuant
to
this
statute
has
been
punished?
