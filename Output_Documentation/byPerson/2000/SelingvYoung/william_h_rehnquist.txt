chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
99-1185,
mark
seling
v.
andre
brigham
young.
ms.
hart.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
both.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
youngberg
certainly
didn't
go
that
far.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
wouldn't
afford
a
basis
for
any
federal
relief,
i
take
it,
if
it's
simply
a
claim
that
the
confinement
violates
the
washington
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
perhaps
it's
even
narrower
than
has
been
suggested
judging
from
your
question
presented.
what
we're
actually
talking
about
is,
does
the...
was
the
ninth
circuit
wrong
in
saying
that
this
statute
as
presented
to
it
could
violate
either
the
ex
post
facto
clause
or
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
paraphilia,
if
that's
the
word?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
what...
he
was
originally
convicted
of
rape?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
i
presume
under
washington
law
some
sort
of
mens
rea
is
required
for
the
offense
of
rape.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
i
mean,
would
washington
law
at
least
recognize
a
defense
that
he
was
unable
to
control
his
actions?
or
would
it
be
the
mcnaughton
test?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
hart.
mr.
boruchowitz.
am
i
pronouncing
your
name
correctly?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
campbell
case
was
in
state
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
yerkwo
either
an
ex
post
facto
or
a
double
jeopardy
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
hudson
was
an
opinion
dealing
precisely
with
the
constitutional
claim
that
you're
raising.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
with
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
the
double
jeopardy
clause
make
any
such
distinction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
gardner
the
claim
was
made
that
the
rule
in
general
had
an
ex
post
facto
effect
on
gain
time,
and
i
think
our
court
said
you...
it's
not
enough
to
show
it
might
have
affected
some
people.
you've
got
to
show
it
affected
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
is
quite
different,
i
think,
from
what
you're
saying.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
not
your
fault--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that
you're
before
this
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
if
the...
what
constitutional
question
was
involved
in
shaw?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
boruchowitz.
ms.
hart,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
hart.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-1185,
seling
against
young
will
be
announced
by
justice
oâ€™connor.
