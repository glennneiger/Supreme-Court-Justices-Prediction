--and
is
that
the
basis
for
the...
is
it
the
turay
suit?
there
is
a
pending
1983
case,
so
we
don't
have
to
speculate,
at
least,
about
the
basis
of
that
lawsuit.
what
is
the
constitutional
right
that's
invoked
in
that
litigation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
there
language...
perhaps
it
was
in
hendrix...
that
the
first
question
is,
does
the
legislature
mean
to
enact
a
civil
or
criminal
provision,
and
then
the
second
question
is,
is
the
scheme
so
punitive
in
purpose
or
effect,
and
i
emphasize
or
effect,
as
to
transform
the
civil
remedy
into
criminal
penalty?
what
does
that
mean,
yes,
the
legislature
wants
a
civil
statute,
not
a
criminal
statute,
but
it
is
so
punitive
in
effect
as
to
be
transformed
from
civil
to
criminal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
one
respond
to
the,
what
i
understood
to
be
the
complaint
in
this
case,
which
is,
i
am
civilly
committed,
and
yet
i'm
housed
in
a
prison
and
i'm
treated
worse
than
i
was
treated
when
i
was
serving
a
sentence
of
conviction?
that's
essentially,
as
i
take
it,
his
complaint.
there's
no
change
in
my
circumstances
from
the
time
i
was
incarcerated
as
punishment.
if
anything,
i'm
being
treated
worse
now
than
i
was.
how
does
one
answer
that
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
understanding
is
that
he
did
have
a
proceeding
in
the
state
court
before
he
came
to
federal
court,
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
only
that,
so
at
that
stage
he
wasn't
complaining
about
the
treatment
he
was
in
fact
getting.
he
was
complaining
about
the
right
to
continue
confinement,
is
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
asked
if
in
his
states
court
litigation
he
was
challenging,
as
he
is
now,
that
he
is
being
kept
in
confinement,
that
he's
being
treated
no
better
and,
in
fact,
worse
than
he
was
treated
when
he
was
in
prison.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
there
is
a
final
adjudication
after
the
remand
from
the
washington
supreme
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
described
the
first
instance
decision
in
rather
careful
words.
you
say
that
they
declined
to
find
that.
did
they
reject
such
a
claim?
did
they
say,
even
if
he
would
establish
that
he's
being
treated
no
better
and
perhaps
worse,
he
still
has
no
claim.
what
was
the
reason
he
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
what
happened--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
was
the
reason
for
overturning
the
trial
judge's
disposition
in
campbell?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you're
right,
then
i
take
it
every
member
of
that
class
that's
now
involved
in
a
1983
case
would
have
an
equally
valid
habeas
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
all
of
the
named
plaintiffs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
would
that
evidentiary
hearing
differ
from
the
one
that's
already
been
had
in
the
federal
court
in
the
turay
case?
