justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
a
constitutional
claim?
i
mean,
what
constitutional
claim
does
he
have
other
than
the
double
jeopardy
claim?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
ex
post
facto.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
but
i
mean,
assuming
the
statute
is
not
punitive,
does
he
have
any
other
constitutional
relief
for
the
fact
that
he
is
not
getting
the
treatment
which
the
statute
provides
he's
supposed
to
be
given?
is
that
a
constitutional
claim,
or
just
a
state
law
claim?
justice
antonin
scalia
correct.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
but
what
other
federal
constitutional
claim
would
he
have?
justice
antonin
scalia
cruel
and
unusual
punishment?
he's
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
do
you
have
to
disagree
entirely?
i
suppose
you
could
take
into
account
the
administration
in
determining
what
the
meaning
of
ambiguous
provisions
of
the
statute
are.
that
wouldn't
be
harmful,
i
suppose.
but
you
wouldn't
say
you
could
take
into
account
the
implementation
to
such
a
degree
that
you
would
allow
the
implementation
to
contradict
the
very
terms
of
the
statute,
which
is
what
you're
talking
about
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
the
point
was
that
if
they
were
punitive
they
would
have
violated
the
washington
statute.
was
that
the
point
of
the
proceeding?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
violating
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
effect
that
way.
i
mean,
that's
the
crucial
language,
purpose
and
effect.
does
it
mean,
the
effect
as
evident
from
the
face
of
the
statute,
which
is
what
your
opponent
says,
or
does
it
mean
the
effect
as
it
is
played
out,
even
if
that
contradicts
the
face
of
the
statute?
that's
the
crucial
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
that
language,
effect,
means.
