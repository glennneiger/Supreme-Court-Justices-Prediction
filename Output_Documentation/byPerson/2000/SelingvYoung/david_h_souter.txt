justice
david
h.
souter
well,
in
effect
the
claim
is
that
if
you
commit
me
for
treatment,
you've
got
to
treat
me.
i've
got
a
substantive
due
process
right
to
that
effect--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
i
am
treatable.
but
that's
the
kernel
of
it,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
if
the
statute
has
been
administered
for
some
period
of
time
before
the
adjudication,
i
take
it
that
the
experience
under
that
administration
may
be
considered
in
what
we
are
calling
a
facial
inquiry.
justice
david
h.
souter
insofar
as
this
case
is
concerned,
i
take
it,
you
leave
open
the
possibility...
you
certainly
don't
concede
it,
but
you
leave
open
the
possibility
that
there
could
be
a
federal
substantive
due
process
claim
on
the
theory
that
we
threw
out
a
moment
ago,
you
and
i
were
talking
about
a
moment
ago,
which
i
guess
has
been
asserted,
and
that
is,
if
the
state's
purpose
in
commitment
is
treatment,
and
i
have
a
treatable
condition
and
they
don't
treat
me,
that
is
a
violation
of
due
process.
i'm
not
asking
you
to
concede
that
that
theory
should
prevail,
but
that
is
at
least
a
possible
assertion
that
could
be
made
in
a
federal
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
and
i
take
it
that
the...
that
for
you
to
win
this
case
the
proposition
that
your
case
really
turns
on
is
not
even
a
broad
proposition,
or
a
broad
set
of
rules
about
how
we
determine
whether
it's
criminal
or
civil,
but
rather,
your
case
depends
on
the
proposition
that
it
doesn't
vary
from
individual
to
individual.
it
is
either
civil,
or
it
is
criminal,
and
that
the
details
of
individual
treatment
do
not
affect
that
determination.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
may
in
substance
agree
with
you,
but
is
that
why
we
have
this
case?
i
mean,
i
don't...
i
didn't
think
we
had
this
case
to
determine
whether
the
statute
was
criminal
or
civil.
i
thought
we
had
this
case
to
determine
whether,
given
a
classification
as
civil,
it
may
then
later
be
treated
as
having
a
criminal
character
with
respect
to
its
application
to
particular
individuals,
and
isn't
that
latter
issue
the
one
that's
before
us?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
assumption,
as
i
understand
it,
and
i
may
be
wrong
on
this,
but
i
thought
the
assumption
of
the
ninth
circuit's
position
was
that
we
start
with
the
proposition
that
it
is
a
civil
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
it's
application
may
be
rendered
criminal
in
particular
cases.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
and
so
the
issue
before
us
is
whether
the
ninth
circuit,
whether
that
option
is,
in
fact,
available,
and
one
of
the
things
that
we
want
to
know,
and
this
goes
back
to
justice
breyer's
question
is,
let's
assume
it's
not
available.
let's
assume
that
criminality
of
the
statute's
character
is
not
a
shifting
and
springing
quality.
does...
on
the
assumption
that
it's
a
civil
statute,
does
your
client
have
a
remedy
under
state
law,
and
i
would
add
to
it,
does
he
have
a
remedy,
even
on
the
assumption
of
civil
character,
under
federal
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
his
claim
would
be--
justice
david
h.
souter
--substantive
due
process?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
the
claim
that
i
was
talking
about
with
counsel
for
the
state.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
he's
got
that,
and
he
has
a
state
law
claim
that
he's
entitled
to
treatment
which
he's
not
getting.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may
be
all
of
those
things,
but
wasn't
the...
i'm
not
sure
they're
before
us.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
mr.
boruchowitz,
doesn't...
again,
doesn't
your
argument
go
to
a
different
issue
from
the
one
that's
before
us?
you're
arguing,
i
think,
that
your
client
should
have,
or
should
have
had
an
opportunity
to
show
that
this
is
not
like
the
hendrix
statute,
and
that
this
one
is,
in
fact,
a
punitive
statute,
and
therefore
all
the
punitive
protections
apply?
but
that's
not
the
issue
that
we've
got
before
us,
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
the
issue...
and
we
can
make
it
either
or.
i
thought
the
issue
we
had
before
us
was
a
determination
by
the
state
court
that
the
statute
here
was
like
the
hendrix
statute
and
therefore
we
had
a
civil
statute,
and
the
question
was,
may
the
application
of
that
statute
nonetheless
be
treated
as
criminal
in
particular
cases,
even
though
the
statute
is
classified
as
a
general
matter
as
civil?
i
thought
we
had
the
latter
issue,
not
the
issue
whether
he
should
be
able
to
prove,
or
could
prove
that
it
was
in
constitutional
terms
unlike
hendrix
in
a
criminal
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
question...
let
me
do
it
again.
the
question
is,
is
the
issue
before
us
whether
this
is
a
criminal
statute,
or
is
the
issue
before
us
whether
a
civil
statute
may
nonetheless
give
rise
to
claims
of
violating
criminal
constitutional
protections
if
the
civil
statute
is
not
followed
by
its
own
terms?
which
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
on
your
view
the
reason
he
could
not,
on
justice
stevens'
hypothetical,
argue
that
the
court
had
made
a
mistake
in
finding
the
statute
across
the
board
to
be
a
civil
statute
is
that
the
character
of
the
statute
on
your
view
must
be
determined
on
the
text
of
the
statute,
on
the
basis
of
the
statutory
text
alone,
is
that
it?
you
could
find
that
the
text--
