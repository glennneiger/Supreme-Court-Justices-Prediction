mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
yes,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i'd
like
to
begin
by
answering
quickly
some
of
the
questions
that
the
court
just
asked.
justice
kennedy's
question
with
regard
to
the
evidence
about
mr.
young's
mental
abnormality,
the
testimony
was
that
from
the
single
state
psychologist
was
that
he
has
a
paraphilia
not
otherwise
specified.
he
also
has
a
personality
disorder
not
otherwise
specified,
neither
of
which,
standing
alone,
would
support
the
prediction
that
the
psychologist
was
required
to
make,
but
by
combining
the
two,
by
51
percent
he
would
say
that
mr.
young
would
be
dangerous.
there's
no
evidence
of
volitional
control
or
the
lack
of
volitional
control.
there's
no
jury
instruction.
there's
no
requirement
about
that
whatsoever
and,
as
the
dsm
makes
clear,
simply
having
a
disorder
in
the
dsm
does
not
make
any
indication
about
lack
of
volitional
control.
with
regard
to
the
question
about
the
evidence
below--
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
--under
the
washington
statute,
yes.
the
test...
well,
yes.
we
have
argued
that
in
the
state
court
and
lost,
that
that
volitional
control
element
is
required,
and
as
the
amicus
brief
suggests,
that
remains
potentially
unclarified
by
the
hendrix
opinion,
but
in
washington
that
testimony
was
sufficient.
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
with
regard
to
the
testimony,
to
the
decision
in
the
superior
court
below
in
mr.
young's
case
at
the
joint
appendix,
page
61,
the
trial
court
applied
to
mr.
young
a
burden
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
order
to
show
that
the
effect
of
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
the
judge
did
find
that
we
proved
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
certain
conditions
were
less
than
treatment
and
greater
than
prison
and
so
forth
but,
since
she
applied
to
us
beyond
reasonable
doubt,
we
lost.
in
the
campbell
case,
which
is
pending
cert
in
this
court,
a
judge
found
that
in
fact
the
conditions
were
unconstitutional,
so
that
needs
to
be
clarified,
i
suggest.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
campbell
lost
in
the
supreme
court
and
is
now
pending
cert
here.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
basically
the
state
supreme
court
took
the
position
that
the
attorney
general
is
here,
that
a
statute
should
be
looked
at
only
on
its
face,
and
that
the
effect
of
the
statute,
the
conditions
of
the
statute,
the
punitive
conditions
of
the
statute
as
implemented
didn't
make
any
difference.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
well,
your
honor,
i
think
there
are
many
problems
with
it.
this
court,
of
course,
has
not
interpreted
the
washington
statute.
you
only
interpreted
the
kansas
statute,
and
all
three
opinions
in
hendrix
focused
on
the
conditions
of
confinement.
the
majority
said,
no
one
here
is
claiming
that
there's
punitive
conditions.
no
one
here
is
claiming
that
mr.
hendrix
is
not
treated
as
a
civilly
committed
person,
and
so
we
look
at
that
and
we
decide
it's
not
punitive.
justice
kennedy
suggested
that
if,
in
fact,
it
turns
out
that
treatment
is
a
sham,
then
the
decision
would
go
the
other
way,
and
the
dissent
focused
heavily
on
conditions
and
showed
that
treatment
was
not,
in
fact,
there,
so
my
suggestion
is
that
this
court
over
and
over
and
over
again
in
a
series
of
cases
has
looked
at
how
a
statute
is
implemented.
in
the
allen
v.
illinois
case
this
court
said
this
would
be
a
different
case
if
somebody
had
claimed
that
there
was
punitive
conditions.
most
recently
in
gardner
v.
jones
this
court,
in
evaluating
an
ex
post
facto
claim,
said,
we're
going
to
remand
this
case
because
there
wasn't
enough
discovery
done
below
about
what's
actually
going
on,
and
what
the
court
said
is
that
the
respondent
must
show
that,
as
applied
to
his
own
case,
his
own
sentence,
the
law
created
a
risk
of
ex
post
facto,
and
also
said
in
gardner,
when
the
rule
does
not
by
its
own
terms
show
a
significant
risk,
the
respondent
must
demonstrate
by
evidence
drawn
from
the
rules
practical
implementation
in
his
case.
as
long
ago
as
yerkwo
v.
hopkins,
that's
the
position
that
the
court
took,
that
a
statute
that
was
on
its
face
neutral,
but
that
was
as
applied
with,
as
the
court
put
it,
an
unequal
eye,
or
an
evil
eye,
an
unequal
hand,
that--
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
--no,
it
was
not,
your
honor,
but
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
reasoning
that
the
court
has
applied
in
many
different
areas
of
the
law
is
to
look
at
the
implementation
of
the
statute
and
that
the
actions
of
an
administrative
agency,
whether
it's
the
parole
board
in
gardner,
or
the
city
laundry
regulators
in
yerkwo,
represent
the
state
itself,
and
that
the
state--
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
--i
think
precisely,
your
honor,
the
issue
before
you
is
whether
the
ninth
circuit
was
correct
in
ordering
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
question
of
whether
the
initial
confinement
render
the
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
he
would
have
a
remedy,
your
honor,
to
sue
under
1983
in
state
or
federal
court.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
his
claim
would
be
a
due
process
claim
that
he--
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
--yes.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
the
reality,
both
of
the
effect
of
the
statute
and
of
the
litigation
that's
been
going
on.
it's
been
6
years
since
a
federal
court
has
enjoined
the
state
in
this
matter.
the
federal
court
held
the
state
in
contempt,
noting
its
foot
dragging
and
deliberate
avoidance
of
his
injunction
on
the
treatment
need
at
the
facility.
the
former
director
called
the
facility
dysfunctional,
so--
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
--well,
the
reason
i
mention
it,
your
honor,
is
you
ask,
does
he
have
a
viable
alternative,
and
i
think
there
may
be
a
civil
remedy,
but
the
civil
remedy
does
not
get
at
the
fundamental
question
in
this
case,
which
is
that
my
client
has
been
punished
for
10
years
under
a
so
called
civil
commitment
statute.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
well,
your
honor,
some
of
them
certainly
would,
depending
on
what
the
district
court
eventually
finds
at
the
hearing.
i
would
point
out,
by
the
way,
that
i
don't
believe
it's
an
actual
certified
class,
but
there
are
multiple
named
plaintiffs,
but--
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
--but
certainly
everyone
would
be
able
to
bring
their
own
challenge
as
applied
to
them,
in
fact,
the
statue
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
young
should
be
able
to
have
his
day
in
the
trial
court,
in
the
federal
district
court,
as
the
ninth
circuit
has
ordered,
to
be
able
to
show
that
the
purpose
and
effect
of
this
statute
are,
in
fact,
unconstitutional.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
right.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
well,
your
honor,
the
posture
of
this
case
is
somewhat
unusual
in
that
the
court
has
taken
cert
of
this
case
before
the
evidentiary
hearing
in
district
court,
and
the
ninth
circuit
said,
send
this
back
because
mr.
young
didn't
have
his
evidentiary
hearing
which
he
should
have
had.
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out,
in
response
to
what
justice
ginsburg
asked
earlier,
mr.
young
has
claimed
that
this
statute
was
being
punitively
applied,
and
that
in
fact
it
was
punitive
in
purpose
from
the
very
beginning.
he
brought
a
personal
restraint
petition
before
he
even
has
his
trial
in
state
court,
so
he
has
made
this
claim
from
the
very
beginning,
both
that
the
effect
of
this
statute
illuminates
the
punitive
purpose,
and
that
the
effect
itself
is
punitive.
after
hendrix,
and
after
the
ninth
circuit
remanded
the
case
the
first
time,
then
the
focus
of
the
court
was
on
the
punitive
effect.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
absolutely.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
yes,
justice
stevens,
because
in
fact
the
whole
purpose
of
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
to
challenge
unconstitutional
incarceration,
and
the
relief
is
release,
and
that's
what
mr.
young
has
been
asking
for
from
the
day
he
filed
his
habeas--
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
--yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
even
more
the
case
now,
after
10
years,
but
yes,
at
the
very
outset
this
was
a
facility
that
was
set
up
with
not
even
a
licensed
psychologist
on
staff.
this
was
not
what
the
court
described
in
hendrix,
of
a
psychiatric
facility
with
31
hours
a
week
of
treatment.
this
was
a
facility
that
did
not
even
have
a
licensed
psychologist,
that
had
no
certified
sex
offender
treatment
providers
until
long,
long,
long
after
the
injunction
was
in
place.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
the
issue.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
well,
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
but
let
me
try
this--
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
--i
think
between
the
two
i
think
it's
the
second
question.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
yes,
but
i
believe
that
on
remand
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
suggests
that
the
district
court
should
examine
the
effect
of
the
statute
and
along
the
way
mentions
some
evidentiary
aspects
that
to
the
ninth
circuit
looked
as
if
the
statute,
in
fact,
were...
had
a
punitive
purpose,
a
deterrent
purpose.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
well,
your
honor,
i
think
one
of
the
first
questions
for
the
district
judge
to
decide
would
be
what
nature
proceeding
he
would
undertake,
and
whether
he
would
simply
use
a
record
that
had
been
established
in
the
other
proceeding,
whether
collateral
estoppel
would
apply
on
certain
issues
and,
if
not,
whether
he
would
take
evidence
on
recent
developments.
that's
something
we
haven't
reached
yet,
but
i
would
think
that
would
be
the
first
question
for
the
judge
to
decide.
what
nature
of
evidence
do
i
take?
do
i
simply
look
at
the
record
judge
dwyer
has
prepared
over
10
years,
or
do
i
look
at
some
additional
evidence?
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
yes.
it--
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
well,
both...
i
have
to
answer
yes
to
both
questions,
because
that's
been
our
position
from
the
very
beginning,
that
the
statute
in
its
purpose
was
punitive,
as
evidenced
by
not
only
the
legislative
history,
which
this
court
in
kennedy
v.
mendoza
martinez
described
as
the
objective
manifestation
of
the
law,
the
legislative
history,
and
also
by
the
purpose
and
effect.
by
the
effect,
the
implementation,
which
this
court
also
looks
at
over
and
over
again.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
justice
breyer--
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
--well,
there
are
several
ways
to
do
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
hendrix
was
decided
affecting
hendrix
alone
and,
as
you
suggested
in
dissent,
if
the
concern
that
justice
kennedy
had
in
his
concurrence
about
the,
either
potential
of
the
sham
treatment
or
the
imprecision
of
mental
abnormality,
were
to
come
true,
that
in
fact
due
process
implications
would
be
raised
as
well,
as
you
put
it
in
your
dissent.
so
i
think
all
three
opinions
in
hendrix
looked
at
the
condition
of
confinement
and,
of
course,
did
not
look
at
the
washington
statute.
you
have
not
looked
at
the
washington
statute,
and
that's
not
your
function
today,
because
what
you're
being
asked
to
do
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
remand
was
correct
or
not.
now,
along
the
way,
you
have
to
examine
the
question
of
how
do
we
go
about
making
that
decision,
and
initially
you
look
at
the
face
of
the
statute,
but
that's
not
enough.
the
civil
label
is
not
enough,
you've
said
over
and
over
again,
and
what
you
do
then
is,
you
look
beyond
that
to
the
purpose
and
effect.
has
it
been
implemented
in
such
a
way
that
the
effect
is
punitive?
if
it's
punitive,
then
double
jeopardy
and
ex
post
facto--
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
--i
agree.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
yes,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that's
right,
and
my
suggestion
is
that
hudson
doesn't
even
mention
hendrix.
hendrix
talks
in
all
three
opinions
about
the
condition
of
confinement,
and
cites
other
cases
that
talk
about
implementation.
hudson
was
a
question
involving
fines
and
debarment
imposed
by
the
controller
of
the
currency.
hudson
was
decided
6
months
after
hendrix,
doesn't
even
mention
it,
let
alone
purport
to
overrule
it.
this
court
has
over
100
years
of
history,
in
many,
many
different
areas
of
the
law,
of
looking
at
how
a
statute
is
implemented
to
determine
its
constitutionality.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
there
are
key
differences
from
hudson,
and
they
boil
down
to
liberty
versus
money,
because
in
hudson
you're
talking
about
fines
and
debarment,
and--
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
--i
don't
think
it
does,
no,
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
court's
opinions
have
indicated
a
greater
concern
about
implementation
of
the
law
and
the
facts
as
applied
when
liberty
is
involved,
and
i
think--
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
--i
was
just
going
to
say
that
in
the
ex
post
facto
context,
certainly
that's
what
the
gardner
decision
did,
because
the
court
said
the
facts
are
not
before
us
as
to
how
this
statute
is
implemented,
and
the
policies
and
practices
of
the
parole
board
certainly
should
be
considered,
and
so
we're
going
to
remand
for
that.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
i
understand
the
court's
point,
but
i...
my
suggestion
is
this,
that
just
as
it
was
important...
i
mean,
the
ultimate
question
in
gardner
v.
jones
is,
is
there
an
ex
post
facto
violation
for
mr.
jones,
and
the
question
here,
ultimately,
not
necessarily
at
this
moment
in
this
court,
but
ultimately,
is
there
a
double
jeopardy
and
ex
post
facto
violation
in
mr.
young's
case,
and
so
how
do
we
do
that?
in
gardner,
we
look
at
the
implementation
as
applied
to
him.
he
has
to
put
on
evidence
of
as
applied
to
him.
and
in
young,
all
we're
asking
for
is
what
the
ninth
circuit
ordered,
which
is
our
opportunity
to
do
that.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
no,
your
honor.
i
suppose
they
could
merge
it.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
well,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
the
court
could--
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
--no.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
it
seems
to
me
that
now
that
we're
here
the
court
could
do
many
different
things.
the
court
could
simply
say,
we
meant
in
hendrix
that
the
conditions
were
important.
we
were
all
concerned
about
that,
and
the
ninth
circuit
is
right
to
consider
the
purpose
and
effect
as
shown
by
the
conditions.
you
could
just
do
that.
you
could
also
say,
by
the
way,
mental
abnormality,
we
really
did
mean
what
we
said
about
lack
of
control,
and
that
there
should
be
some
showing
about,
the
person
has
no
volitional
control,
and
that
would
clear
up
a
lot
of
things
in
the
lower
courts.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
supplemental
two
page
brief,
the
state
of
kansas
just
decided
that
yes,
in
fact,
hendrix
does
require
the
lack
of
volitional
control.
the
court
could
also,
i
suppose,
go
beyond
the
question
presented,
which
it
has
the
authority
to
do,
and
say,
this
statute
certainly
looks
like
it's
very
different
than
what
we
though
hendrix
was,
and
at
least
in
washington
as
it's
being
applied
there's
a
problem,
but
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
do
that.
the
court
simply
can
say,
we're
going
to
remand
this
case
and
let
the
court
of
appeals
order
stand,
because
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
simply
done
is
to
apply
hendrix.
there's
nothing
different
from
hendrix
in
what
the
ninth
circuit
did.
we're
simply
going
to
send
it
down
for
the
district
court
to
evaluate
it,
and
if
the
district
court,
judge
cunero
decided
that
let
judge
dwyer
handle
it
because
he's
done
the
1983
litigation,
that
could
easily...
that's
something
the
district
court
could
do
if
it
decided
to
do
that.
but
obviously
the
1983
litigation
has
not
been
a
habeas
situation
involving
the
question
of
release
because
of
unconstitutional
punishment,
and
what
this
case
is
ultimately
about
is
that
a
man
has
been
punished
for
10
years
in
a
prison,
longer
than
he
served
under
his
criminal
sentence,
without
having
committed
another
crime
and
without
having
a
traditional
mental
disorder.
and
so
there
are
many
issues
presented,
and
i
think
one
of
the
things
that's
difficult
about
examining
this
case
is
that
it's
something
fundamentally
radically
different
from
a
true
civil
commitment.
there's
nothing
wrong
with
a
true
civil
commitment,
but
this
is
not
civil
commitment.
this
is
punishment.
and
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
various
cases
that
we've
cited
here,
one
other
thing
about
hudson
that
i
think
is
important
is
that
the
court
said
that
the
penalties
in
hudson
did
not
approach
the
infamous
punishment
of
imprisonment.
they
involved
administrative
disability,
and
they
were
imposed
in
administrative
proceedings.
in
ward,
the
court
found
that
the
penalty
for
oil
discharge
and
water
pollution
was
more
analogous
to
traditional
civil
damages.
in
shaw
v.
martin,
before
the
court
found
that
pretrial
detention
did
not
violate
due
process,
the
court
examined
the
actual
conditions
of
confinement
and
cited
testimony
in
the
opinion
about
actual
practices.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
due
process,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
i
appreciate
that,
your
honor.
the
court
has
often
considered
punishment
in
a
parallel
way,
whether
it's
due
process,
double
jeopardy,
or
ex
post
facto,
but
i
certainly
acknowledge
that
shaw
was
a
due
process
case.
this
is
a
situation
where,
as
judge
dwyer
indicated
in
the
turay
1983
litigation,
for
all
intents
and
purposes
this
is
a
prison.
it
looks
like,
feels
like,
and
is
a
prison
run
by
the
department...
or
the
external
facility
run
by
the
department
of
corrections,
which
is
at
page
6
of
our
brief,
joint
appendix
147.
this
is
a
situation
where
the
state
of
washington,
over
the
time
that
the
injunction
has
been
in
place,
has
made
it
harder
to
get
less
restrictive
alternatives.
one
of
the
things
that
this
court
was
concerned
about
in
hendrix,
and
specifically
mentioned,
was
the
less
restrictive
alternative
idea,
and
what
washington
has
done
in
the
last
5
years
is
to
eliminate
less
restrictive
alternative
from
the
initial
court
determination
and
to
make
it
harder
for
someone
to
get
it.
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
over
and
over,
in
a
number
of
cases
involving
both
double
jeopardy
and
due
process
and
ex
post
facto
has
been
to
look
at
the
statute
as
applied.
in
foosha,
justice
thomas
dissented
saying
that
this
would
be
a
different
case
if
the
procedures
as
applied
would
show,
as
he
put
it,
window
dressing
in
that
case.
in
fact,
what
we
have
here
is
the
actual
implementation
of
the
treatment
has
turned
out
to
be
a
sham.
the
court
has
said
over
and
over
that
if
you
can
show
by
the
clearest
proof
that
a
statute
is
punitive
in
effect,
then
you
can
win.
the
clearest
proof
by
its
terms
suggests
that
evidence
will
be
taken,
because
otherwise
where
is
the
proof?
in
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question,
does
it
just
mean
what
naturally
flows
from
the
language,
or
does
it
mean
the
actual
implementation?
i
would
suggest
that
clearest
proof
means
proof
of
evidence,
not
simply
proof
of--
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
--just
that
my
client
is
being
punished,
justice
stevens.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
i
think
so,
your
honor,
because
ultimately
the
logical
extension
of
the
state's
position
is
that
you
could
torture
someone
and
beat
them
and
deprive
them
of
food,
and
as
long
as
the
state
calls
it
civil--
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
--that's
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
but
ultimately,
if
the
way
the
statute
is
being
applied
to
an
individual
is
punitive--
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
--well,
your
honor,
we
don't
have
a
record
that
would
allow
me
to
say
that
categorically,
that
everyone...
i
think
certainly
in
response
to
justice,
i
believe--
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
--our
answer
is
yes
to
that,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
answer
that
question
to
rule
in
mr.
young's
behalf,
but
i
think
you're
right
that,
as
we've
been
arguing
from
the
very
beginning,
the
statute
had
a
punitive
purpose,
it
was
designed
to
close
the
gaps,
we
couldn't
accept
the
double
jeopardy
and
ex
post
facto--
mr.
robert
c.
boruchowitz
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
court
could
say
that
the
application
to
all
other
prisoners
would
certainly
enlighten
the
question
of
what's
applying
to
mr.
young,
but
the
court
doesn't
need
to
reach
that
question.
but
i
think
the
answer
to
the
question
would
be
yes,
because
it
has
had
a
punitive
purpose
and
effect
from
the
beginning,
but
i
don't
think
there's
anything
that's
in
conflict
with
hendrix
for
us
to
go
forward.
what
hendrix
said
was,
nobody
here's
saying
it's
punitive,
it
applies
to
hendrix
alone,
it
would
be
different
if,
and
that's
what
the
court
has
said
in
many
different
circumstances,
including
allen
v.
illinois.
the
case
would
be
a
different
case
if
someone
had
shown
that
there
was
a
punitive
effect.
so
over
and
over
again
i
think
the
court
has
looked
at
the
actual
implementation
of
the
statute,
but
you're
right,
i
think
from
the
very
beginning
he's
been
committed
without
authority
of
law.
let
me
just
take
a
minute
to
mention
ex
parte
virginia,
because
i
think
it's
important
when
the
state
argues
that
an
administrative
agency
does
not
bind
the
state
in
some
way.
this
court
said
that
whoever
by
virtue
of
a
public
position
under
state
government
deprives
another
of
constitutional
rights
violates
the
constitution,
and
he
acts
in
the
name
and
for
the
state
and
his
act
is
that
of
the
state.
there
can
be
no
defense
here
that
it's
simply
the
administrative
agency
running
amok.
this
is
certainly
an
act
of
the
state
that
binds
the
state.
the
state...
thank
you,
your
honor.
