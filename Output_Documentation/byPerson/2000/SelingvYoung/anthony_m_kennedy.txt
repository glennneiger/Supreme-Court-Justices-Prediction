does
a
person
have
that
disorder
if
he
has
or
she
has
volitional
control?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they've
talked
about
this
in
the
brief,
and
i'm
never
quite
sure
of
the
full
significance
of
this
part
of
the
inquiry.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
talk
about
this.
do
the
psychiatrists
talk
about
this
in
a
way
that
has
meaning
to
them?
do
they
say,
this
person
has
or
has
not
volitional
control?
is
that
a
standard
psychiatric
frame
of
evaluation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
interpret
the
findings
here
that
he
lacked
volitional
control?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
your
position
was
that
you
can
challenge
this
statute
at
the
very
outset
of
the
order
committing
him
based
on
the
fact
that,
as
demonstrated
by
the
way
in
which
the
treatment
facility
is
operated,
it
is...
it
is
not
for
a
civil
purpose,
and
that
the
classification
of
the
disease
is
too
imprecise--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
admit
of
psychiatric
treatment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
simply
want
to
use
evidence
of
existing
conditions
to
challenge
the
operation
of
the
statute
at
the
time
that
he's
subjected
to
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
seems
somewhat
different
than
the
answer
you
gave
to
justice
souter.
