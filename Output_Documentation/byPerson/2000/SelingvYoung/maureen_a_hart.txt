ms.
maureen
a.
hart
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
case
presents
a
narrow
but
important
issue,
and
it
concerns
how
this
court
determines
the
threshold
question
of
whether
a
statute
is
civil
or
criminal.
this
threshold
inquiry
is
important
because
it
establishes
what
constitutional
rules
apply
to
a
statute
and
that
the
statute
must
satisfy,
and
also
what
constitutional
protections
are
available
to
people
who
are
subject
to
the
statute.
it
also
is
important
because
this
same
threshold
inquiry
applies
to
many
kinds
of
statutes,
not
just
statutes
such
as
washington's,
providing
for
the
commitment
of
sexually
violent
predators.
it
applies
to
numerous
statutes,
including
others
that
deal
with
confinement
such
as
more
generalized
civil
commitment
laws,
commitments
for
drug
or
alcohol
treatment,
statutes
such
as
quarantine
statutes,
and
statutes
relating
to
pretrial
detention.
in
this
case,
the
ninth
circuit
rejected
the
principle
that
whether
a
law
is
civil
or
criminal
is
a
threshold
question
based
on
legislative
intent
and
the
face
of
the
statute.
instead,
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
washington's
admittedly
civil
law
may
be
divested
of
its
civil
nature
and
converted
into
a
criminal
law
if
conditions
of
confinement
at
washington's
special
commitment
center
are
punitive.
in
other
words,
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
fundamental
nature
of
a
law
as
either
civil
or
criminal
may
vary
and
that
the
same
statute
may
be
both
civil
and
criminal
at
different
times
and
in
different
places.
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
is
fundamentally
wrong.
it
conflicts
with
the
holding
of
this
court
in
hudson
v.
united
states.
it
doesn't
serve--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--i
think
that
in
habeas
an
individual
who's
subject
to
confinement
could
come
in
and
the
purpose
of
habeas
would
be
for
that
person
to
indicate
that
for
some
constitutional
reason
the
very
fact
or
duration
of
his
or
her
confinement
violates
the
constitution.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
think
that
what
mr.
young
has
here
essentially
is
a
civil
rights
claim
that
the
conditions
of
confinement
at
the
special
commitment
center
are
not
what
they
ought
to
be.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
yes,
there
is,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
i
believe
that's
correct.
the
special
commitment
center
is
under
the
supervision
of
the
federal
district
court
in
washington
at
the
moment.
that
particular
case
basically
deals
with
issues
of
whether
there's
adequate
treatment
at
the
special
commitment
center.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
in
this
case,
your
honor?
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
he
would
have
each
of
those
claims,
and
in
this
case,
provided
he...
that
our
statute
is
punitive--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--he
would
have,
certainly
under
washington
statute,
a
state
law
claim
in
the
sense--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--that
the
statute
requires
adequate
treatment
and--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--the
only
federal
constitutional
claim
that
i
believe
might
otherwise
be
involved
here
would
be
a
claim
that
goes
to
conditions
of
confinement
on
some
sort
of--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--no,
not
with
respect
to
any
issues
that
would
flow
from
the
criminal
law,
your
honor.
there
are...
certain
decisions
of
this
court
will
not
precisely
reach
an
issue
that
i
read
to
suggest
that
individuals
who
are
deprived
of
their
liberty
are
entitled
to
certain
minimal
adequate
conditions
of
confinement
as
perhaps
a
matter
of
substantive
due
process.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
in
the
litigation
that's
ongoing
currently--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--justice
ginsburg,
the
right
that
is
being
invoked
is
essentially
a
right
that
one
might
find
derivative
from
your
decision
in
youngberg,
and
that
is
a
right
to
a
certain
level
of
mental
health
treatment.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
that's
the
essence
of
the
claim,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
it
didn't,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
that
that's
where
the
genesis
of
the
claim
in
this
case,
and
as
i
say,
there's
certain
language
in
youngberg
that
would
perhaps
lead
one
in
that
particular
direction.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
your
honor--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--no,
your
honor.
this
court
has,
for
purposes
of
civil
commitment
has
required
two
predicates.
one
is
a
mental
condition,
and
the
other
is
an
existing
dangerousness.
once
that
civil
commitment
is
affected,
however,
your
honor,
there
are
certain
claims
that
can
be
made
and
are
being
made
in
the
state
of
washington
that
the
individual
subject
to
that
commitment
is
entitled
to
adequate
care
and
an
adequate
level
of
treatment,
but
that
doesn't
go
to...
the
conditions
of
confinement,
your
honor,
wouldn't
go
to
the
face
of
the
statute,
or
whether
the
statute
itself
is
punitive.
this
court--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--your
honor,
i
don't
find
an
answer
to
those
questions
precisely
in
this
court's
jurisprudence.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
one
of
the
things
this
court
has
said,
however,
on
a
due
process
level,
is
that
a
statute...
if
the
state
is
going
to
claim
that
it's
committing
an
individual
for
treatment,
that's
what
its
statutory
purpose
is,
then
the
statute
ought
to
relate
to
that
in
terms
of
the
nature
of
the
confinement
and
the
duration
of
the
confinement.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
your
honor,
this
statute
confines
for
treatment
and
in
order
to
protect
the
community
from
these
individuals,
so
it's...
statutorily
it
serves
both
purposes.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
washington's
statute.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
washington's
statute
specifically
requires
that
individuals--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--i
believe
my
answer
to
the
question,
as
i
understand
it,
justice
breyer,
is
yes.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
no,
your
honor,
that
would
not.
one
of
the
things
about
this
statute
is
that
mr.
young
and
others
like
him
have
a
remedy
under
state
law,
and
that
remedy,
because
of
the
way
our
statute
is
read,
is
to
ensure
and
press
litigation,
as
is
being
done
in
washington,
that
the
appropriate
level
of
care
and
treatment
is
being
provided,
but
he...
but
it--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--well,
your
honor,
this
court
has
pointed
to
a
number
of
indicators,
all
of
them
determined
facially
under
the
court's
jurisprudence
in
hudson,
such
as
whether
there
is
a
confinement
in
the
first
place,
what
is
the
purpose,
and
whether
the
statute
is
rationally
related
and
fulfills
that--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--whether
a
statute
is
criminal
or
civil...
civil,
excuse
me...
this
court
has
held
is
a
facial
matter.
that's
precisely
what
the
court
held
in
hudson,
and
in
doing
so
disavowed
an
approach
that
it
had
taken
in
helper
that
looked
at
the
actual
effects,
but...
or
conditions
of
confinement
would
be
the
equivalent
here.
but
your
honor,
that
doesn't
mean
that
people
like
mr.
young
are
without
a
remedy,
or
that
they
are
left
unable
to
secure
the--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
that's
essentially
what
this
court
held
in
hudson
when
it
overruled
helper.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
two
things
about
that.
first,
that
hudson
stands
for
the
proposition
and
reaffirms
the
notion
that
the
effects
test
for
whether
a
statute
is
civil
or
criminal
is
a
facial
test,
and
having
given
you
that
answer,
i
believe
that
what
the
effects
test,
or
what
that
language
means,
is
what
are
the
necessary
consequences
of
the
very
statutory
provisions
that
whether
it's
congress
or
state
legislature
has
provided.
that
would
be
the
effects.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
i'm
afraid
i
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
that's
essentially
the
essence
of
the
claim
before
the
court.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
yes,
it
does.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
yes.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
that's...
that
would
be
true,
your
honor,
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
language
that
you're
dealing,
or
you're
quoting
from,
from
hendrix,
is
language
that
for
each
of
those
propositions
one
can
go
back
to
the
hendrix
opinion
and
find
that
the
source
of
those
things,
such
as
the
procedural
protections,
the
segregation
from
the
prison
population,
within
the
statute,
just
as
one
can
in
the
state
of
washington.
and
as
you
noted
in
writing
the
dissent
in
hendrix--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--the
kansas
law,
our
state
law,
washington
state
law
was
a
model
for
the
kansas
law.
they're
essentially
identical,
except
for
some
places
where
washington's--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--i
believe
that
a
resident
at
the
center
would
have
that
opportunity
under
state
law
to--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--i
believe
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
i
would
like
to
note
that
since
the
question
really
before
this
court
is
that
narrow
question
of
how
the
court
determines
whether
a
statute
is
civil
or
criminal,
that
that
kind
of
issue
and
concern
is
one
that
really
is
reflected
in,
i
think
in
part,
or
you
can
find
in
part
in
the
factors
that
this
court
looks
at
facially.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
that's
correct.
those
are
the
only
two
claims
involved
in
this
case
and
before
this
court.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
i
think
the
way
one
answers
it
in
the
state
of
washington
first
of
all
has
been
referenced
by
other
members
of
the
court,
is
that
washington's
law
requires
the
provision
of
adequate
care
and
individualized
treatment
to
these
individuals.
the
other
thing
that
i
think
answers,
or
helps
answer
that,
your
honor,
is
that
washington's
law,
just
like
kansas'
law,
is
a
civil
commitment
statute,
and
once
having
enacted
a
civil
commitment
statute,
there
are
certain
consequences
that
fall
from
that
for
a
state,
and
among
them
is
to
provide
care
more
considerate
than
one
would
receive
or
is
constitutionally
entitled
to
receive
in
a
penal
institution.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
yes.
there
is
a
direct
appeal
by
mr.
young
from
his
commitment.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
i'm
sorry,
i
missed
the
last
part
of
your--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--your
honor,
that
really
wasn't
an
issue
on
the
direct
appeal.
when
the
washington
supreme
court
affirmed
mr.
young's
commitment
it
remanded
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
two
purposes,
to
determine
whether
a
less
restrictive
alternative...
or
actually
for
one
purpose,
to
determine
whether
a
less
restrictive
alternative
to
total
confinement
would
be
appropriate
to
mr.
young,
and
in
the
context
of
that
proceeding,
at
the
outset
of
that
proceeding,
mr.
young
challenged
the
conditions
of
confinement
at
the
special
commitment
center.
there
was
a
hearing
of
some
week's
duration
on
that
issue,
and
the
court
declined
to
conclude
that
the
conditions
of
confinement
were
punitive.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
your
honor,
my
understanding,
and
it
is
correct,
it's
not
simply
my
understanding,
is
that
there
has
been
an
appeal
from
that,
and
that
appeal
is...
that
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
is
pending
now.
in
other
words,
the
supreme
court
of
washington
sent
this
back
to
the
trial
court
on
a
less
restrictive
issue,
less
restrictive
alternative.
in
the
context
of
that
proceeding,
mr.
young
raised
the
issue
of
conditions
of
confinement,
was
not
successful
there,
and
is
now
appealing
that
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
washington,
and
that
matter
is
pending.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
the
court...
this...
the
order
from
this
proceeding
the
court
will
find
at
page
ja
49,
the
joint
appendix
at
49,
and
the
court
after
trial
simply
concluded...
let
me
see...
simply
concluded
that
he
had
not
demonstrated
that
the
conditions
were
punitive.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
i
believe
the
proceeding
itself
was
a
generalized
challenge
to
conditions
of
confinement
at
the
special
commitment
center.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
i
believe
that
the
focus
there
was
a
constitutional
type
substantive
due
process
claim,
justice
scalia.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
mr.
young
was
found
to
suffer
from
a
severe
paraphilia
characterized
either
by
sexual
sadism
or
rape,
as
well
as
a
severe
antisocial
personality
disorder.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
it's
essentially
a
mental
condition
that
is
characterized
by
recurrent
and
intense
urges
and
fantasies,
sexual
fantasies
with
respect
to
things
that
are
either
nonhuman
objects,
nonconsenting
adults,
children...
it's
a
pathological,
pathologically
driven
mental
condition.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
i
think
that--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--in
washington's
statute,
mental...
a
mental
abnormality,
which
is
a
predicate
to
commitment
under
washington
law,
requires
a
condition
that
does
affect
volitional
control.
my
understanding,
your
honor,
of
this
sort
of
mental
disorder,
this
sort
of
paraphilia,
is
that
it
is
a
difficulty
with
volitional
control,
that
you'll
have
situations
where
individuals
will
have
these
repeated
urges
and
fantasies
and
then
act
on
them,
perhaps
be
remorseful,
but
they
will
repeat,
and
the
ability
to
control
them
is
something
that
the
individual
cannot
do
consistently.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
not
that
i'm
specifically
aware
of,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
it's
somewhat
inherent
in
the
nature
of
this
particular
mental
condition.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
under
washington
statute,
he
would
have
to
have...
suffer
from
a
mental
abnormality,
or
was
bound
to
suffer
from
a
mental
abnormality,
your
honor,
that
entails
a
lack
of
volitional
control,
or
at
least
an
impairment
of
his
ability
to
control
what
he
does.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
he
was...
he
has
a
lengthy
criminal
history,
your
honor,
of
six
violent
rapes.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
i
believe...
i
believe
that's...
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
there's
necessarily
a
mental
element.
there
may
be
a
mental
element.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
i
think
in
washington
it
would
be
the
ability
to
discern
right
from
wrong.
just
before...
i'd
like
to
save
a
couple
of
minutes
for
rebuttal,
but
the
other
thing
i
would
like
to
do
before
i
do
this
is
essentially
to
sort
of
bring
this
case
back
to
the
question
before
the
court
and
to
make
the
court
understand
that
a
number...
and
i'm
sure
you
do
appreciate
that,
that
a
number
of
the
questions
that
you're
posing
here
are
ones
that
have
already
been
resolved
against
mr.
young
both
in
the
washington
supreme
court
and
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
that
the
very
narrow
and
limited
issue,
but
important
one,
before
this
court
is
rather,
how
the
court
determines
whether
a
statute
is
civil
or
criminal.
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
reserve--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
again
that
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
very
narrow
issue,
and
it
is
a
threshold
issue,
and
that
is,
how
the
court
determines
whether
a
statute
is
civil
or
criminal.
hudson
establishes
that
that
is
done
facially.
washington...
the
issue
about
whether
washington's
statute
is
civil
or
criminal
is
not
before
this
court.
both
the
washington
supreme
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
have
held
that
washington
statute
is
civil
on
its
face,
meaning
the
legislature's
intent
was
to
have
a
civil
statute
and
that
in
purpose
and
in
effect
the
washington
statute
is
civil.
the
predicates
for
commitment
are
not
at
issue
before
this
court.
there
is
no
question
that
mr.
young
suffers
from
a
mental
abnormality
and
a
personality
disorder
that
makes
him
likely
to
engage
in
sexually
violent
acts
if
he
is
not
detained.
that
is
not
before
this
court.
the
washington
supreme
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
have
both
ruled
against
mr.
young
on
those
issues,
and
there
was
no
cross
petition
here.
the
only
issue
before
this
court,
and
what
mr.
young
is
contending,
is
that
because
he
alleges
that
he
is
not
receiving
treatment
consistent
with
a
civil
statute,
that
he
ought
to
be
released,
and
the
only
way
mr.
young
can
contend
that
is
by
saying,
if
i
do
not
receive
the
treatment
that
i'm
entitled
to
under
a
civil
statute,
somehow
that
converts
this
statute
to
a
criminal
statute,
that
one
day
your
statute
can
be
civil,
the
next
day
it
can
be
criminal.
in
mr.
young's
view,
if
washington
had
two
commitment
centers
instead
of
one,
the
law
would
be
civil
at
the
center
where
the
commitment...
where
the
treatment
was
adequate
and--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--then
everyone
committed
pursuant
to
the
statute
would
be
entitled
to
go
into
either
state
court
or
federal
court
and
get
those
remedies,
get
those
conditions
remedied,
but
they
do
not
go
to
the
validity
of
whether...
they
do
not
go
back
to
the
character
of
washington's
statute.
washington's
statute
is
a
civil
law,
and
that
is
meaningful.
it
means
that
people
confined
pursuant
to
that
law
are
entitled
to
the
treatment
that
civil
committees
are
given
under
the
statute
and
under
the
constitution,
and
the
proportionate,
measured,
wholly
adequate
remedy
is
to
go
to
court
and
require
the
state
of
washington
to
provide
the
treatment
and
the
care
that
it
has
promised.

maureen
a.
hart
under
the
hudson
test.
