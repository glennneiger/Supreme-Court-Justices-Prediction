unknown

ex
post
facto.
unknown
speaker
both.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
turning
to
this
case,
when
at
the
outset
a
determination
is
made
for
an
order
for
a
civil
commitment,
is
there
no
basis
for
the
court
to
determine
and
to
look
at
how
the
disease
is
defined,
how
the
treatment
is
defined,
what
treatment
facilities
are
available
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
it's
punitive?
unknown
speaker
isn't
there
some
initial
assessment
that
must
be
made?
unknown
speaker
why
is
that?
i
mean,
suppose
you
have
a
compulsive
ax
murderer,
and
you
know,
he's
served
his
time,
but
he's
still
a
compulsive
ax
murderer.
you
could
not
commit
him
simply
because
he's
dangerous
and
then
not
provide
treatment?
or
what
about
quarantine
of
someone
who
has
a
communicable
disease?
in
order
to
quarantine,
do
you
have
to
provide
treatment?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
can
find
for
us
a
civil
purpose
that
clearly
cannot
be
fulfilled,
is
that
one
index
at
least,
or
one
indicator
of
an
intent
to
punish?
unknown
speaker
so
you
read
our
precedents
as
saying
our
inquiry
must
be
simply
confined
to
a
facial
inquiry,
and
not
to
the
reality
of
what
the
treatment
is
or
is
going
to
be?
unknown
speaker
may
i
put
the
question
just
a
little
differently?
assume
our
first
case
holds
that
a
statute
is
civil,
a
facial
attack
on
the
statute
as
being
criminal
authorization
for
double
jeopardy
and
ex
post
facto
violation,
and
we
reject
that
by
saying
the
statute
on
its
face
is
a
civil
statute.
does
that
mean
that
every
application
of
that
statute
that
might
subsequently
be
challenged
would
have
to
come
up
with
the
same
answer?
in
other
words,
is
it
conceivable
that
a
statute
which
is
valid
in
response
to
a
facial
attack
could
nevertheless
be
invalid
as
applied
in
particular
cases?
unknown
speaker
if
that's--
--you
win
if...
no,
please.
well,
all
right.
unknown
speaker
am
i
right
in
saying
from
your
prior
answer
that
you
think
your
statute
meets
all
those?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
mental
disorder,
or
the
personality
disorder,
or
the
mental
abnormality
that
was
established
here?
unknown
speaker
and
is
it
conceded
by
all
sides
that
that
showing
is,
under
washington
law,
sufficient
to
commit
him
civilly?
unknown
speaker
and
you
add
that
you
can
make
this
showing
at
the
very
outset
of
the
order
committing
him
to
the
civil
treatment?
unknown
speaker
sorry.
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
quite
right.
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
i
think
that
doesn't
help
you
very
much
when
you're
trying
to
transpose
that
holding
over
into
double
jeopardy
or
ex
post
facto,
which
are
much
more
precise.
unknown
speaker
part
of
your
allegation
could
seem
to
establish
that,
if
this
particular
facility
is...
has
no
psychiatrist
and
is
in
a
correction
facility,
everybody
incarcerated
there
must
be
punished,
i
would
think.
