chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
99-1953,
the
district
of
columbia
v.
tri
county
industries.
mr.
reischel.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
that
the
court
of
appeals
used
the
expression,
a
more
searching
inquiry
than
had
the
motion
been
denied.
i
didn't
realize
they
used
the
term,
strict
scrutiny.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
they
use
the
term,
more
searching
inquiry,
as
i
understand
it,
to
compare
it
with
the
sort
of
inquiry
where
the
district
court
has
denied
the
motion
for
a
new
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
it's
comparing
it
with
something.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
your
position
that
it
is
exactly
the
same
inquiry
in
the
court
of
appeals
whether
a
district
court
grants
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
or
denies
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
somehow
counterintuitive,
though
i
realize
that
doesn't
make
it
wrong,
that
where
a
district...
where
the
trial
judge
is
in
effect
giving
effect
to
the
jury's
verdict,
he
shouldn't
get
a
more
lenient
standard
of
review
than
when
he
disapproves
it
or
sets
it
aside.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
true
whether
he
denies
the
motion
or
grants
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
we've
got
here,
mr.
reischel,
the
question
before
us
is
the
standard
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
applied,
as
opposed
to,
perhaps,
what
it
did
apply,
not
whether
it
was
right
or
wrong
in
this
particular
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
reischel,
you're
still
arguing
the
merits
of
this
particular
ruling
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
with
it,
rather
than
fitting
it
into
a
standard
argument.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
we're
going
to
decide
here
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeals
properly
reversed
the
trial
judge's
decision.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
reischel.
mr.
emig.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
a
rational
trier
of
fact
could
not
have
reached
that
conclusion,
it
isn't
setting
aside
a
jury
verdict
jmol.
i
mean,
if
a
rational
jury
could
not
reach
a
verdict
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff,
it
seems
to
me
the
case
never
should
have
gone
to
the
jury
in
the
first
place.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
by
hypothesis
there
a
rational
jury
could
reach
a
verdict
in
favor
of
the
party
whom
it
did,
but
there
are
other
considerations
brought
to
bear.
you
have
great
weight
of
the
evidence,
you
know,
improper
admission,
things
like
that,
that
permit
the
grant
of
a
new
trial
where
it
would
not
have
permitted
the
grant
of
a
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
we've
got
here,
mr....
some
fundamentals
first,
and
that
is,
a
refusal
of
the
trial
judge
to
let
the
case
go
to
the
jury
on
the
directed
verdict
against
the
plaintiff
and
a
judgement
as
a
matter
of
law,
or
call
it
that,
or
granting
a
motion
for
a
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
after
the
jury
returns
a
verdict
is
the
rational
basis
standard.
that
is,
no
rational
jury
could
have
reached
the
verdict
that
this
jury
did,
and
that
is
not
involved
here,
i
take
it.
what
we're
talking
about
is
the
grant
of
a
new
trial
by
the
trial
judge,
and
by
hypothesis,
a
rational
jury
could
have
reached
a
verdict
but
still
have
it
set
aside
because
it's
against
the
great
weight
of
the
evidence,
and
the
standard
now
we're
talking,
we
want
to
find
out,
when
the
trial
judge
grants
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
that
way,
what
standard
should
the
court
of
appeals
apply?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
just...
when
you
start
talking
about,
could
a
reasonable
jury
have
reached
the
result,
you're
back
to
the
judgment
nov,
or
judgment
mol
as
they
call
it
now,
rather
than
weight
of
the
evidence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
is...
what
should
be
the
standard?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
well,
you've
shown
us
why
you
think
the
trial
judge's
ruling
was
improper.
we're
not
the
court
of
appeals.
what
standard
should
the
court
of
appeals
have
decided
when
it
heard
your
argument?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
the
term,
more
searching
inquiry,
suggests
they're
going
to
be
a
little
more
demanding,
or
more
willing
to
reverse
the
grant
of
a
new
trial
than
they
will
the
denial
of
a
new
trial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
is
there
anything
wrong
with
that
point
of
view?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
would
help
you
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes,
well,
but
as
pointed
out
by
some
of
my
colleagues
abuse
of
discretion,
but
being
more
willing
to
reverse
the
grant
of
a
new
trial
under
some
circumstances
than
the
denial
of
a
new
trial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
then,
certainly,
what
does
a
more
searching
inquiry
mean,
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--why
do
you
think
they
said,
more
searching
inquiry,
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
more
searching
inquiry
mean?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it...
you
can
always
go
to
a
dictionary
and
figure
out
for
yourself
what
it
means.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
let's
take
a
more
close
look,
rather
than
more
searching
inquiry.
both
a
pretty
much
the
same
thing,
and
it
means
a
greater
willingness
to
reverse
in
the
case
of
grant
of
a
new
trial
than
denial
of
a
new
trial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
don't
have
to
favor
a
plaintiff
or
a
defendant
in
that
sort
of
an
equation.
you
favor
the
person
who
got
the
jury
verdict.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
not
applied
that
standard,
maybe
it
would
not
have
been
in
your
view
the
correct
result.
maybe
they
would
have
affirmed
the
trial
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
emig.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
