mr.
charles
s.
reischel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
principal
issue
here
today
is
fundamental
to
the
functioning
of
our
civil
jury
system,
but
it
is
one
which
the
courts
of
appeals
have
disagreed
about
for
decades.
that
issue
is
whether
a
trial
court
which
sets
aside
a
jury
verdict
in
a
civil
case
as
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence
is
entitled
to
very
substantial
deference
by
an
appellate
court.
we
submit
that
the
trial
court
is
entitled
to
such
substantial
deference.
indeed,
we
submit
that
the
standard
is
whether
any
reasonable
judge
could
have
concluded
that
the
verdict
was
against
the
weight
of,
the
great
weight
of
the
evidence.
we
submit
that
the
d.c.
circuit
below
applied
the
strict
scrutiny
standard,
which
boils
down
in
practice
to
whether
there
was
sufficient
evidence
for
the
question
to
go
to
the
jury.
we
submit
this
was
error.
it's
inconsistent
with
what
a
trial
court
does.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
i'm
sorry,
more
searching
inquiry
is
the
phrase
that
they
do
use.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
yes,
and
there
are
also
other
distinctions
about
the
sort
of
error
that's
involved,
but
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
yes,
your
honor,
it
is,
and
our
position
is,
can
any
rational
judge
have
made
that
decision.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
i
don't
think,
on
analysis,
it
is.
this
is
ultimately
rooted
in
the
unique
perspective
a
trial
court
has
on
the
evidence.
as
justice
black
said
in
cone
v.
west
virginia
pulp
&
paper,
when
a
trial
court
in
ruling
on
a
motion
to
set
aside
a
trial,
to
order
a
new
trial,
he
has
a
fresh
perspective
on
the
evidence,
he
has
just
seen
it
go
in,
he
has
also
got
a
fresh
perspective
on
the
effect,
the
impact
of
the
evidence
on
the
jury--
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
--that's
true.
it's
true
in
either
case,
but
the
trial
judge
is
there.
the
trial
judge
sees
what
happens,
and
for
that
reason
the
trial
judge
and
the
trial
judge
alone
can
actually
engage
in
weighing
the
evidence.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
well,
the...
there
is
one
minor
difference,
and
that
is,
the
court
has
to
look
to
whether
the
trial
court
applied
the
proper
standard.
that
is,
when
he
sets
side
a
verdict
that's
contrary
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence,
the
question
is,
can
a
rational
judge
have
made
that
decision?
that
is,
was
it
clearly
contrary
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
that's
true,
but
the
trial
judge
has
a
much
better
take
on
both
the
force
of
the
evidence
and
the
impact
on
the
jury.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
i
think
that's
implicit
in
the
great
weight
of
the
evidence
part
of
the
test.
the
rational
judge
has
to
be
able
to
say
that
this
was
against
the
great
weight
of
the
evidence.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
i
think
the
words
have
had
real
consequences
in
appellate
review.
i
think
if
one
looks
to
what
the
d.c.
circuit
and
other
circuits
following
the
lindh
decision
actually
do
is,
it
boils
down
to
was
there
evidence
to
support
the
jury
verdict?
if
there
was,
they
say
that
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
set
it
aside,
but
it's
hornbook
law
that
a
court
can
set
aside
a
jury
verdict
even
if
there's
substantial
evidence
to
support
it
if
the
court
makes
an
independent
determination,
without
drawing
inferences
for
the
verdict,
an
independent
determination
that
it's
contrary
to
the
great
weight
of
the
evidence.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
there
are--
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
--there
are
a...
my
answer
is
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
my
answer
is
yes
it
can
be.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
there
are,
justice
scalia,
a
range
of
different
kinds
of
credibility
determinations.
one
might
be
what
someone
might
call
eyeball
credibility.
you
look
at
a
person
testifying,
and
are
they
lying,
are
they
sweating,
are
they
nervous,
all
of
that.
the
other
kind
of
credibility
finding
is,
is
what
they're...
does
what
they're
saying
make
sense,
and
to
the
extent
that
there's
a
credibility
determination
involved
here,
the
question
went
to
the
credibility
of
the
financial
expert
because
the
financial
expert,
dr.
morris,
based
his
financial
projections
on
data
that
wasn't
rooted
in,
and
was
contrary
to,
what
the
industry
expert,
direnzo,
said.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
if
we're
talking
about
what
i
would
call
eyeball
credibility,
the
courts
are...
the
circuits
are
in
disagreement
as
to
whether
the
trial
judge
can
reevaluate
that
independently.
some
of
them
say
no.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
that's
true.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
that's
true,
and
the
judge
here
made
two
kinds
of
findings.
one,
he
made
a
finding
that
he
excluded
evidence
he
should
not
have
and
disabled
the
jury
in
performing
its
function,
and
the
most
important
evidence
that
he
excluded
was
the
october
15
invitation
to
be
heard.
the
harm
here
was
that
tri
county
industries
said
they
were
harmed
because
they
hadn't
been
heard,
but
then
they
turn
around
and
spurn
an
invitation
to
be
heard,
and
the
judge
excluded
that
evidence,
and
he
did
so
in
part
because
of
his
ruling
that
all
these
issues
had
been
resolved
earlier,
and
then
when
he
thought
about
it
said,
that
wasn't...
that
isn't
right,
and
it
probably
confused
the
jury.
but--
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
--well,
the
court
of
appeals
can't
see
the
witnesses,
and
it
can't
see
the
jury,
and
it
can't
tell
what
impact
a
particular
witness
might
have
on
the
jury.
the
key
witness
here
for
purposes
of
future
earnings
was
dr.
morris,
dr.
morris
who
came
on
as
a
ph.d.
and
said,
i've
read
a
ton
of
things
and
i'm
an
expert
in
this
field,
and
i
can
do
all
these
mathematical
things,
but
when
he
was
cross-examined
said,
yes,
but
i
based
all
of
my
industry
stuff
on...
all
my
prices
on
the
apex
report
by
direnzo,
and
what
direnzo's
report
said
was
that
prices
were
being
driven
down
so
that
they
barely
covered
costs.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
it
goes
to
the
probative
force,
i
think,
of
his
testimony.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
that's
correct,
and
that--
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
--that's
right,
justice
o'connor,
and
that's
precisely
what
the
trial
court
could
weigh
and
what
an
appellate
court
cannot
weigh.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
yes,
your
honor.
we
think
that
follows
from
gasperini.
gasperini
says,
if
we
read
it
correctly,
that
an
appellate
court
can
assess
matters
of
fact
only
if
there's
no
reasonable
disagreement
about
the
facts.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
but
this
wasn't
simply
eyeball
credibility.
this
was,
is
what
the
expert
is
doing
here,
does
it
make
sense?
he's
testifying
about
projected
future
profits
where
the
underlying
industry
evidence,
the
only
industry
evidence
produced
also
by
tri
county,
showed
that
this
heat
remediation
that
they
were
getting
into
was
a
declining
industry,
and
that
the
last--
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
--the
jury
discounted
his
testimony,
but
the
jury
still
came
up
with
a
4.64
million
dollar
return--
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
--on
a
9
million
dollar
investment.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
he
said...
yes.
he
said,
150
percent
return
per
year,
or
125
percent
return
per
year.
the
jury
found
49
percent
return
per
year
for
each
of
7
years,
in
an
industry
where
the
segment
of
the
industry
was
shrinking,
and
the
last
entrant
who
had
tried
to
come
in
had
found
it
necessary
to
gain
market
share
to
cut
prices
below
cost
and
had
failed.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
damage
assessment
is
a
reasonable
one.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
and
where
tri
county's
own
evidence
is
that
the
last
person
who
entered
failed,
it's
a
shrinking
industry,
and
that
prices
are
being
driven
down
just
barely
to
cover
costs,
it's
not
reasonable
to--
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
--no.
there
were--
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
--the
judge
didn't
take
that
position,
either.
the
judge
took
the
position
that
a
million
dollars
of
damages,
which
would
have
been
a
5-percent
return
on
investment,
was
about
right
because
there
was
a...
well,
i
assume
because
there
was
a
differential
for
transportation
costs,
but
to
project
49-percent
return
each
of
7
years
in
a
declining
industry
where
the
last
person
failed
is
not
a
reasonable
projection,
and
the
judge
said,
this
is
pro
forma.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
reality.
he
said,
at
page
ja-79,
how
do
you
explain
this
in
light
of
the
fact
that
prices
are
being
driven
down
to
costs?
how
do
you
explain,
he
said
in
his
decision--
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
--i
think
what
he
was
finding
was,
if
one
looks
just
at
the
industry
testimony,
that
is
direnzo's
testimony,
that
there
was
a
slight
boost
for
this
industry
in
d.c.
because
transportation
costs
were
slightly
better,
so
one
could
say
that
they
might
be
entitled
to
make
a
modest
return
on
investment.
5
percent
per
year
is
a
modest
return
on
investment.
49
percent
per
year
for
7
years,
i'd
like
to
have
that
kind
of--
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
--right,
but--
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
--as
i
read--
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
--well,
as
i
read
gasperini,
appellate
courts
are
not
allowed
to
weigh
evidence.
trial
courts
are.
appellate
courts
aren't.
trial
courts
are
allowed
only
to--
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
--weigh
evidence.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
no,
gasperini
doesn't
talk
about
the
difference
between
grants
and
denials,
but
the
linchpin
of
gasperini
as
i
read
it,
in
terms
of
assessing
facts,
is,
they're
quoting
dagnello
v.
long
island,
whether
there
has
been...
there
must
be
an
upper
limit,
and
whether
that
has
been
surpassed
is
not
a
question
of
fact
with
respect
to
which
reasonable
men
may
differ,
but
a
question
of
law.
as
i
read
gasperini,
what
the
court
was
saying
was...
and
this
was
about
excessive
damages...
that
trial
courts
can
weigh
things
and
examine
things,
but
appellate
courts
must
take
the
facts
as
given
unless
it's
beyond
the
point
where
reasonable
men
can
disagree.
here,
i
don't
think
there's
a
question,
and
i
think
that
drives
us
to
the
standard
that
we
propose,
which
is
whether
a
reasonable
judge
could
have
come
to
this
conclusion.
if
a
reasonable
judge
couldn't
have,
then
there's
room
to
disagree.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
there's
no--
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
--that's
correct.
that's
correct,
and
the
judge
thought,
on
the
basis
of
the
only
competent
market
evidence
there
could
have
only
been
a
very
modest
gain
and
not
the
sort
of
49
percent
per
year
gain
that
the
jury
awarded,
much
less
the
124
percent
per
year
gain
that
the
financial
expert
projected.
but
the
court
did
say
several
different
things.
two
rulings,
the
rulings
on
mitigation,
which
was
a
ruling
that
if,
as
tri
county
testified,
that
they
thought
they
were
going
to
be
2
million
dollars
a
year
in
profits...
2
million
dollars
a
year
in
profits
from
this
new
entity
that
they
were
going
to
set
up...
is
it
reasonable
for
them
to
do
absolutely
nothing?
they
didn't
respond
to
a
letter
inquiry
about
what
their
position
was.
they
didn't
pay
a
500
dollar
fine,
which
said
on
its
face
if
you
don't
pay
this
your
license
is
going
to
be
suspended.
they
didn't
show
up
at
a
hearing,
and
they
said--
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
i
do
that
in
part,
your
honor,
to
show
what
the
circuit's
test
has
boiled
down
to.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
the
response
to
that
naive
argument
is,
the
d.c.
circuit's
standard
boils
down
to,
if
there's
sufficient
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury,
that's
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
the
standard
as
the
d.c.
circuit
has
explicated
it,
particularly
in
the
taylor
case,
which
respondent
cites
at
page
26
of
its
brief,
explains
what
the
d.c.
circuit
understands,
and
it
says
that
when
a
trial
court
sets
aside
a
jury
verdict,
the
appellate
court's
normal
allegiance
to
the
trial
court
falls
away,
and
its
allegiance
is
to
the
jury,
and
that
drives
them
to
the
point,
which
they
did
in
this
case,
of
saying,
if
there's
enough
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury,
that's
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
there
has
been
a
difference
in
application
which
has
driven
the
appellate
courts
to
ask
only,
was
there
sufficient
evidence
to--
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
--they
are
imposing
a
more
stringent
standard.
in
a
way
the
standard
is
more
stringent
anyhow,
because
the
great
weight
of
the
evidence
point
is
built
into
it
when
there's
a
reversal,
and
it's
not
built
into
it
when
there's
a
denial.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
yes,
your
honor.
that's
hornbook
law,
that
when...
even
though
there's
sufficient
evidence
to
uphold
a
jury
verdict,
it
can
be
set
aside
so
long
as
the
trial
court
thinks
it's
against
the
great
weight
of
the
evidence,
and
that
goes
back
to
blackstone,
whose
test
was,
was
the
judge
reasonably
dissatisfied
therewith.
our--
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
--precisely,
your
honor.
courts
of
appeals
are
substituting
the
matter-of-law
test
for
the
new
trial
test,
and
that's
exactly
what--
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
--and
both
kinds--
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
--justice
stevens,
were
committed
here,
but
i
do
want
to
point
out
what
the
d.c.
circuit
did.
they
seemed
to
agree
with
the
statement
on
page
a-7
of
our
petition.
tri
county
responds
that
it
is
improper
now
to
assess
the
relative
strength
of
the
parties
showings,
and
then
they
go
on
to
say
that
it
was
error
for
the
court
to
take
it
away
from
the
jury.
this
is
a
directed
verdict
standard.
it's
the
wrong
standard.
it
negates
what
the
trial
court
is
doing,
and
an
appellate...
the
standard
should
be
whether
a
reasonable
judge
could
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
was
contrary
to
the
great
weight
of
the
evidence,
and
we
believe
that
was
clearly
so
here
for
two
reasons,
one
because
it
was
clearly
unreasonable
for
a
company
that
was
going
to
get
2
million
dollars
a
year
to
do
nothing
whatsoever
to
protect
that
investment
and
because
the
forecast
evidence
of
financial
gain
was
so
out
of
line
with
the
market
evidence
that
tri
county
produced.
mr.
charles
s.
reischel
no,
your
honor.
