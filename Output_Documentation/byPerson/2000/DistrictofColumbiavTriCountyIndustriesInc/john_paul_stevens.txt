stevens
yes,
but
didn't
the
jury
discount
his
testimony
by
about
50
percent
anyway?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
said
it
should
have
been--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
i
understand,
but
he
said
it
should
have
been
twice
that
amount,
didn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
all
that,
but
i
thought
it
was
fairly
elementary
damage
law
that
if
you
prove
the
fact
of
damage,
and
i
guess
that
was
proved
here,
that...
and
if
there
isn't
a
clear
measure
of
damage
out
there,
the
jury's
allowed
quite
a
bit
of
leeway
in
figuring
the
amount
of
damage,
and
here
they
took
half
the
expert's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
didn't
take
the
position
there
was
no
damage.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
took
the
position
the
amount
was
exaggerated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
aren't
you
overlooking
something
rather
important?
it
isn't
only
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
sometimes
an
error
of
law
was
committed
on
either
refusing
to
admit
evidence
or
erroneously
admitting
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
it's
still
true
that
even
though
it's
more
searching
than
the
converse,
it
still
has
to
be
an
abuse
of
discretion,
and
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
itself
tends
to
protect
the
trial
judge
from
reversal.
