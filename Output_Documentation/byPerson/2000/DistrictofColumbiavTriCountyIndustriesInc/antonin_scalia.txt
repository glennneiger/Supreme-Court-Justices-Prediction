justice
antonin
scalia
well,
when
you
say
what
this
is
ultimately
rooted
in,
i
mean,
whatever
decision
we
come
out
with
has
to
be
ultimately
rooted
in
the
seventh
amendment,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
seventh
amendment
certainly
has
quite
different
application
when
you're
talking
about
a
trial
judge
who
has
accepted
the
jury's
verdict
and,
on
the
other
hand,
a
trial
judge
who
has
rejected
the
jury
verdict,
in
effect
overridden
it
and
said
we
have
to
have
a
new
trial.
i
don't
know
why
the
same
standard
of
review
has
to
apply
to
both
of
those
situations
when
the
seventh
amendment
treats
them
differently.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that
a
jury
verdict
can
be
against
the
great
weight
of
the
evidence
when
the
only
thing
that
the
judge
disagrees
with,
the
trial
judge,
is
the
jury's
evaluation
of
credibility?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
that
possibly
be
against
the
great
weight
of
the
evidence?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if...
let
me
tell
you
why
i
asked
the
question--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
if
not...
if
not,
then
the
court
of
appeals
is
fully
able
to
evaluate
the
issue
as
effectively
as
the
trial
judge
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
queer...
that's
a
queer
description
of
credibility.
i
mean,
on
that
basis
any
facts
that
don't
make
sense
are
incredible.
yes,
i
suppose
that's
right,
but
i
wouldn't
consider
that
a
credibility
determination.
i'd
consider
that
a
determination
of
whether
there
was
substantial
evidence
on
the
record.
if
there's
something
on
the
record
that
is
utterly
incoherent
and
makes
no
sense,
that's
not
evidence.
it's
not
adequate
evidence,
and
a
court
of
appeals
can
evaluate
that.
i
thought
that
when
we're
talking
about
credibility
we're
talking
about
the
eyeballing
the
witnesses.
i
don't
believe
this
fellow,
he's
shifty-eyed,
or
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
those
things...
my
point
maybe
wasn't
clear.
i'm
not
saying
that
eyeball
credibility
is
the
only
thing
that
the
district
judge
can
take
into
account.
of
course
he
can
take
into
account
these
other
things,
but
these
other
things
are
evaluable
by
the
court
of
appeals
just
as
readily
as
they're
evaluable
by
the
trial
judge.
a
court
of
appeals
can
say,
well,
this
stuff
was
excluded.
it
could
have
been
let
in,
and
if
it
had
been
let
in,
then
it
would
be
different.
this
instruction
to
the
jury
was
confusing,
you
can
tell
that
from
the
cold
record,
and
if
that's
so,
i
don't
know
why
you
should
give
any
special
deference
to
the
trial
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
reischel--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
about
to
make
the
same
suggestion,
and
the
discussion
we're
having,
it
seems
to
me,
demonstrates
quite
clearly
that
an
appellate
court
can
inquire
into
this
matter
just
as
effectively
as
the
district
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
you're
making
points
that
are
there
on
the
record,
and
reflected
in
the
record
material.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
standard
is
not,
was
there
sufficient
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury,
which
i
assume
is
the
same
as
saying,
could
a
reasonable
jury,
on
the
basis
of
this
evidence,
have
found
for
the
plaintiff,
if
that
is
not
the
test
that
the
appellate
court
is
supposed
to
use
in
deciding
whether
it
was
wrongful
for
the
trial
court
to
set
aside
the
jury
verdict,
then
what
is
the
test?
do
you
think
the
trial
court
can
set
aside
the
jury
verdict
even
when
a
reasonable
jury
on
these
facts
could
have
found
for
the
plaintiff
in
this
amount?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
say
there's
no
difference
between
jnov
and
setting
aside
a
jury
verdict
that's
contrary
to
the
great
weight
of
the
evidence.
i
mean,
that's
revolutionary,
i
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
well,
if
you
do
accept
that
distinction,
then
what
is
your
criterion
for
whether
it
ever
gets
to
the
jury
or
not?
i
assume
it
is
something
different,
as
you've
just
said,
from
the
criterion
of
whether,
after
the
jury
verdict,
the
judge
can
declare
a
new
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
assume
it
is
not,
therefore,
whether
a
rational
jury,
on
the
basis
of
this
evidence,
could
reach
that
result,
which
is
your
standard
for
a
new
trial.
so
what
is
your
standard
for
jnov,
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
the
distinction,
that
for
jnov
you
do
not
have
to
view
all
the
evidence
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
plaintiff,
that...
i'm
sorry,
for
a
new
trial
you
don't
have
to
regard
all
the
evidence
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
plaintiff.
you're
allowed
to
sit
back
and
evaluate
it
impartially.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
be
a
distinction.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
sure
it
does.
if
you're
going
to
conduct
a
more...
look,
if
the
plaintiff
had
the
judgment,
any
inquiry
regarding
the
setting
aside
of
that
judgment
which
is
going
to
be
more
searching
is
going
to
make
it
more
likely
that
that
setting
aside
will
be
held
to
be
improper,
so
it
will
inevitably
favor
the
plaintiff
whose
jury
verdict
has
been
set
aside.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
okay,
whichever.
in
the
case
of
a
remittitur
it's
always
going
to
be
the
plaintiff,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
you'd
be
happy
with
that,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
mr.
emig,
you
didn't
give
us
any
assistance
by
discussing
that
common
law
in
your
brief,
but
i
have
scratched
around
and
i
think
there
was
a...
you
know,
i
dissented
in
gasperini
because
i
thought
that
there
was
no
review
at
common
law,
but
what
the
situation
as
i
understand
it
was,
was
that
there
was
no
review
when
the
district
judge,
when
the
trial
judge
refused
to
set
aside
the
trial,
but
that
there
was
review
in
the
situation
we
have
here,
when
the
trial
judge
did
set
aside.
there
are
several
cases
in
which
the
appellate
court
looked
into
whether
that
was
proper
or
not,
so
i'm...
you
know,
i'm...
now,
where
does
that
leave
me?
if
i
thought
we
were
wrong
in
gasperini,
and
there
were
several
on
this
who
joined
me,
in
allowing
appellate
review
at
all...
we
allowed
appellate
review
there
on
the
basis
of
abuse
of
discretion.
i
guess
to
be
consistent
we
should
have
an
even
stricter
standard
when
there's
review
in
the
situation
where
the
jury
verdict
is
ignored,
so
i
guess
there
should
be
something
beyond
abuse
of
discretion,
or
should...
i
don't
know.
