anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
did
the
judge
explain
the
million
dollars,
other
than
that
was
just
a
further
discount?
he
said,
oh,
it's
a
failing
industry.
i'll
discount
it
more.
it
seems
to
me
that's
all
he
said.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
is
to
way,
there
are
just
more
things
in
the
record
to
review?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
saying
that
you
don't
mind
if
we
remand
this
for
determination
of
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
