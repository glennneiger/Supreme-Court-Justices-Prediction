how
much
weight
you
should
give
the
testimony,
which
i
thought--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
a
form
of
credibility.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
that's
precisely
what
the
jury,
the
fact-finder
must
determine,
and
in
this
case
it
was
a
jury.
do
you
think
that
the
appellate
standard
for
review
is
basically
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
well,
if
it
is
abuse
of
discretion
there
is
still
room
within
that
standard,
i
suppose,
to
say
that
a
jury
fact-finder
determination
on
credibility
of
witnesses
is
not
to
be
disturbed
by
the
trial
judge,
and
if
the
trial
judge
does,
it's
an
abuse
of
discretion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
this
trial
judge
decide
that
he'd
made
an
error
in
excluding
evidence
at
trial,
and
therefore
wanted
to
correct
that
error
somehow?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
at
least
the
trial
judge's
ruling
may
have
been
based
on
his
notion
that
he'd
made
a
mistake
by
excluding
certain
evidence
that
the
defendants
offered.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
support
the
court
of
appeals
decision
or
do
you
not?
i
can't
tell
from
what
you
say.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
you
won,
and
i
thought
you
were
here
saying
yes,
they
got
it
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you're
not
saying
that,
apparently.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
simply
do
not
understand
your
argument.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
they
get
it
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
they
said
they
applied
a
more
searching
inquiry,
was
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
they
did
do
that,
and
that's
okay?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
