justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sometimes
the
evidence
would
be
evidence
that
juries
have
particular
ability
to
evaluate,
or
at
least
the
power
is
given
to
them
saying
witness
demeanor.
there
could
be
other
cases
in
which
the
matter
is
not
particularly
one
that's
suited
to
a
jury.
i
mean,
it
turns...
he
gives
a
new
trial
because
of
something
to
do
with
a
document
and
its
admissibility
or
something
like
that.
would
you
at
least
say
that
where
it's
a
matter
that
the
juries
are
entrusted
with
the
decision,
a
trial
judge
should
be
particularly
careful
of
granting
a
new
trial
contrary
to
the
jury?
i
mean,
what
i'm
wondering
at
is...
what
i'm
wondering
about
is
if
it
perhaps
is
the
same
standard,
but
in
applying
that
same
standard
you
should
pay
particular
attention
when
you
overturn
a
jury
verdict
because,
judge,
the
jury
has
responsibilities
to
decide
things
that
you
don't
have.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
if
that's
true,
would
you
be
satisfied
with
that
result?
suppose
this
court
said,
well,
in
a
sense
it's
the
same
standard,
but
what
searching
inquiry
means
is,
it
means,
after
all,
here
you
are
upholding
the
jury,
not
going
against
the
jury,
and
if
you
were
going
against
the
jury
there
are
many
reasons
why
you
should
be
very
careful.
does
that
satisfy
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
well
then
are
we
arguing
about
anything
other
than
just,
which
is
often
true
in
such
cases,
words?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
can
you
say,
as...
i
thought
that
the
only
question
that
i
saw
was
that
the
d.c.
circuit
wrote
one
sentence
that
i
thought
was
a
throw-away
line,
frankly,
where
it
said
that
there's
a
more
searching
inquiry
when
the
judge
grants
a
new
trial
motion
than
where
he
denies
it.
then
i
thought
to
myself
naively,
where
he
grants
a
motion,
the
court
of
appeals
has
to
see
if
he
invaded,
say,
the
credibility
province
of
the
jury,
and
where
he
denies
it
they
don't
have
to
do
that
job,
so
obviously
it
has
to
be
more
searching,
and
that
stopped
right
there.
all
right,
now,
what's
the
response
to
that
naive
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
does
wright
and
miller
say?
i
mean,
this
is
a
subject...
i
can
only
remember...
it
was
in
my
first
year
of
law
school,
and
all
i
remember
from
that
is,
they
said,
it's
certainly
different.
i
might
not
even
remember
that
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
it
was
absolutely
different,
and
everything's
changed
since
then
anyway,
so
what
do
wright
and
miller
and
the
people
who
write
about
this
say
is
the
standard
for
giving
a
new
trial,
as
opposed
to
a
standard
for
giving
a
directed
verdict?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
use
the
words,
great
weight
of
the
evidence?
what
does
wright
and
miller
say?
what
do
the
writers...
this
is
a
rather
basic
question,
i
think,
that
must
be...
i
can
go
look
it
up
myself,
but...
i
will,
too,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
want
to
reargue
your
case.
now,
why
did
you
take
it
as
an
assumption
that
if
you
lose
on
this
issue
it's
going
to
go
right
back
to
the
d.c.
circuit,
if
you
lose
on
the
issue
which
is
in
front
of
us,
which
is
not
the
issue
that
either
of
you
apparently
wants
to
argue,
and
that's
the
issue
about
whether...
it
says,
did
gasperini
make
unlawful
the
throw-away
line
that
the
d.c.
circuit
threw
in.
now,
maybe
we
shouldn't
be
hearing
that,
but
we're
hearing
it,
so
my
question
concerns
that,
and
i've
looked
at
wright
and
miller,
and
as
i
look
at
their
standards
for
new
trial
it
strikes
me
that
i
understand
very
well
your
uncertainties,
because
what
it
says
is,
there
are
all
kinds
of
verbal
formulations
all
over
the
place,
and
you
say
the
d.c.
circuit
has
adjusted
to
this
over
30
years,
and
i
expect
other
circuits
have
adjusted
over
similar
periods
of
time
to
different
verbal
formulations,
and
if
we
start
fooling
around
with
those
in
this
case,
there
is
no
matter
so
close
to
the
heart
of
the
trial
bar,
and
suddenly
we
will
discover
different
circuits
doing
different
things
in
light
of
what
we
say.
so
if
we
say
you're
right
on
these
words,
searching
inquiry,
some
other
circuit
is
going
to
take
that
as
a
signal
that
they're
wrong
and,
therefore,
if
we
allow
the
d.c.
circuit
to
do
what
it
did
for
30
years,
some
other
circuit
will
be
unable
to
do
what
it
has
done
for
30
years,
so
what
do
we
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
want
me
to
go
back
and
look
at
the
facts
here
in
your
case,
which
i
do
not
intend
to
do,
so
ruling
that
out,
what
do
i
do?
