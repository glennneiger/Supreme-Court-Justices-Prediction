mr.
frank
j.
emig
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
find
that
the
standard
for
granting
a
new
trial
was
suggested
in
the
honda
motor
v.
oberg
case,
where,
in
situations
involving
excessiveness
of
a
jury
verdict,
or
a
verdict
against
the
clear
weight
of
the
evidence,
could
a
national
trier
of
the
fact
have
reached
the
same
conclusions
as
the
jury?
if
a
rational
trier
of
the
fact
could
come
to
that
conclusion,
then
those
traditional
common
law
grounds
for
granting
a
common
law
trial
simply
do
not
exist.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
that's
correct.
it's
probably
a
rule
50
disposition
at
that
point.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
no,
i
don't
think
i'm
going
to
that
extent,
your
honor.
i
think,
though,
that
in
situations
in
which
there
is
a
verdict
against
the
clear
weight
of
the
evidence
or
excessive
damage,
you
have
an
element
of
sympathy
or
prejudice
that
is
injected
in
the
jury
verdict
which
makes
it
not
tied
to
the
specific
facts
of
the
case,
and
for
that
reason
the
trial
judge
has
some
discretion
and
of
course
can
grant
a
new--
mr.
frank
j.
emig
--there
are
situations
in
which
a
new
trial
can
be
granted,
you're
correct,
that
deal
with
improper
instructions,
improper
admissions
of
evidence,
i
would
agree
with
that,
but
to
the
extent
of
a
verdict
being
against
the
clear
weight
of
the
evidence,
if
a
rational
trier
of
fact
could
come
to
the
same
conclusion
as
that
jury,
then
i
don't
think
it
should
be
set
aside
by
a
trial
judge.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
yes--
mr.
frank
j.
emig
--i
do
see
a
distinction.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
i
think
it--
mr.
frank
j.
emig
--well,
certainly
the
jnov
is
phrased
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
party
that
is
seeking,
or
that
the
judgment
is
being
sought
against.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
i
think
that--
mr.
frank
j.
emig
--that
would
be,
and
i
think
the
rules
under
rule
50
do
talk
in
terms
of
phrasing
it,
or
phrase
it
more
in
terms
of
in
a
light
more
favorable
to
the
plaintiff,
or
to
the--
mr.
frank
j.
emig
--well,
i
think
the
court
has
to
decide
whether
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
evidence.
could
a
jury
reasonably
have
reached
the
conclusion,
based
upon
the
evidence,
that
it
did,
and
unless...
i
would
point
out
this,
also--
mr.
frank
j.
emig
--i
think
that's
the
only
way
i
can
explain
how
a
trial
judge
should
look
at
the
evidence
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
a
new
trial
should
be
granted.
i
would
suggest
it's
certainly
not
the
standard
that
the
district
of
columbia
suggests,
that
a
trial
judge
has
unlimited
discretion
to
grant
a
new
trial
as
long
as
his
view
of
the
evidence
is
reasonable.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
i
think
it
should
be
the
standard
that
was
referred
to
in
the
honda
v.
oberg
case,
a...
could
a
rational
trier
of
fact
reach
the
same
conclusion
as
the
jury.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
well,
i
don't
see
them
distinguishing
them.
i
think
that
a
number
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
cases
talk
in
terms
of
whether,
on
great
weight
of
the
evidence--
mr.
frank
j.
emig
--there's
certainly
some
discretion,
your
honor,
but
at
the
same
time,
at
no
point
in
this
opinion
from
the
district
court
does
it
ever
say
that
this
jury
verdict
is
being
set
aside
because
it
was
against
the
great
weight
of
the
evidence.
that
is
a
term
that
is
foreign
to
this
district
court
opinion,
and
the
only
grounds
that
is
asserted
by
the
district
court
judge
is
excessiveness
on
one
point
of
view.
he
does
not
rely
on
the
traditional,
this
is
against
the
great
weight
of
the
evidence.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
that's
correct,
except
in
this
particular
situation
we
know
that
it
was
not
an
excessive...
we
knew
that
from
the
evidence
that
was
presented
of
approximately
12
million
dollars
that
a
rational
trier
of
the
fact
could
have
brought
back
a
verdict
anywhere
up
to
that
amount.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
well,
except
that
a
trial
judge
must
be
limited,
i
think,
by
the
evidence
to
some
extent
when
he
rules
on
whether
or
not
a
verdict
is
excessive,
otherwise
he
can
call
whatever
verdict
he
wants
and
term
it
excessive,
thereby
nullifying
a
valid
jury.
there
has
to
be
some
basis
other
than
the
judge's
characterization
of--
mr.
frank
j.
emig
--he
did,
your
honor,
but
the
problem
of
that
analysis
was
there
was
no
proffer
by
the
district
of
columbia
to
show
how
the
health
and
safety
of
this
project
could
ever
result
in
a
revocation
of
the
permit.
the
district
of
columbia
came
into
this
trial
with
the
expectation--
mr.
frank
j.
emig
--that's
correct,
except
that
that
conclusion
was
not
supported
by
the
evidence.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
well,
i
think
it
should
have
applied
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
the
problem
that
i
have
with
this
entire
more
searching
inquiry,
your
honor,
is,
the
d.c.
circuit
has
been
using
it
for
30
years,
and
at
no
point
in
that
course
of
time
did
they
ever
say,
we
are
applying
it,
that's
changing
the
standard
of
review
to
a
strict
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
well,
i
don't
see
any--
mr.
frank
j.
emig
--i'm
not
sure
it
changed
the
standard
of
review.
the--
mr.
frank
j.
emig
--the
review
was
still
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
i
don't
think
they
actually
say
they're
more
willing
to
reverse--
mr.
frank
j.
emig
--well,
i
think
it's
a
simple
recognition
that
we're
dealing
with
a
jury
reaching
a
certain
determination
and
the
judge
disagreeing
and
granting
a
new
trial.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
i
think
it's
just
an
indication
they're
being
a
little
more
careful,
your
honor.
i
don't--
mr.
frank
j.
emig
--i
don't
think
it
really
substantively
changed
the
analysis
of
the
case.
they
said
on
three
occasions
they
reviewed
for
abuse
of
discretion,
nothing
more,
and
if
they
intended
more
searching
inquiry
to
mean
stricter
abuse
of
discretion,
they
would
have
said
it,
but
they
never--
mr.
frank
j.
emig
--well,
because
i
think--
mr.
frank
j.
emig
--they
don't
define
that,
and--
mr.
frank
j.
emig
--i
understand.
it
certainly
means,
at
the
very
least,
a
more
close
look
at
the
evidence,
but--
mr.
frank
j.
emig
--no,
i
disagree
with
that.
i
think
you're
making
a
jump
in
terms
of
an
outcome
that
is
suggested
by
that
standard
that
is
not
accurate.
i
think
it
just...
it
says
we're
going
to
look
at
it.
we're
not
favoring
the
plaintiff.
we're
not
looking
at
favoring
the
defendant.
we're
just
going
to
look
at
what
happened
more
closely.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
well,
i
don't
think
it
favors
either
the
jury
verdict
or
the
district
court,
which--
mr.
frank
j.
emig
--or
a
defendant.
i
mean,
it's
not
always
the
plaintiff.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
an
abuse
of
discretion
is
a
deferential
standard,
i
would
agree,
but
at
the
same
time--
mr.
frank
j.
emig
--oh,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
i--
mr.
frank
j.
emig
--no,
i
am.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
i
am
saying
that
they
did--
mr.
frank
j.
emig
--they
got
it
right.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
that's
okay.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
but
my
other
point,
too
is,
just
looking
under,
if
this
verbal
formulation
was
omitted
from
the
opinion
it
would
still
be
the
correct
result.
it
was
still
an
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
well,
i
think--
mr.
frank
j.
emig
--i
think
it's
already
been
reviewed
under
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
but
i
would
secondly
say
that
this
court
affirms
judgments,
not
opinions,
and
that
even
if
this
court
were
to
find
that
a
stricter
abuse
of
discretion
standard
was
applied,
the
result
is
still
the
same.
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
well,
i
don't
think
that
this
is
completely
out
of
the
range
of
appellate
review.
if--
mr.
frank
j.
emig
--well,
i
think
you
had
a
say
to
the
extent
if
an
error
of
law
was
committed
that
could
always
be
appealed,
but
at
the
same
time,
the
modern
courts
have
allowed
if
the
judge
makes
an
error
to
have
that
decision
set
aside
and
a
new
trial,
or
the
original
jury
verdict
reinstated.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
well,
i
guess
that
depends
on
whether
the
en
banc
court
was
looked
on
as
operating
in
an
appellate
capacity
in
reviewing
the
facts.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
well,
i...
my
position
in
this,
your
honor,
is
that
it
was
not
set
aside,
the
jury
verdict,
because
it
was
against
the
great
weight
of
the
evidence,
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
case
of
damages.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
i
think
the
one
thing
that
can
be
done
is
simply
to
look
at
the
opinion
itself
from
the
district
court
granting
the
new
trial
and,
if
you
feel
only
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
is
applicable
and
should
not
be
applied
more
strictly,
does
that
opinion,
in
and
of
itself,
constitute
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
then
i
think
in
that
situation
my
position
is,
it's
entirely
unclear
in
terms
of
what
they
meant
and
how
it
was
applied.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
i
did.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
i
think
when
we
included
it
in
our
brief
we
were
simply
asking
the
court
to
pay
close
attention
to
the
facts
of
the
case.
if
d.c.
thought
that
that
entailed
a
stricter
abuse
of
discretion
review,
that
should
have
been
brought
up
at
that
point
and
it
could
have
been
resolved
one
way
or
the
other
by
the
court
of
appeals,
but
they
had
their
opportunity
and
all
of
a
sudden
it
becomes
a
problem
now,
when
the
decision
comes,
and
there's
this
verbal
formulation
of
a
more
searching
inquiry.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
the
d.c.
circuit
only
says,
abuse
of
discretion,
and
i
think
that
under
those
circumstances
that
was
the
correct
standard
to
apply,
and
that
they
were
certainly
entitled
to
review
the
record
more
carefully
because
a
jury
verdict
had
been
set
aside.
mr.
frank
j.
emig
thank
you.
