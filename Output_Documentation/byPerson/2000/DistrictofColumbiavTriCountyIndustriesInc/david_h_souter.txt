justice
david
h.
souter
but
why
isn't
that
answer...
i
have
the
same
question
that
justice
breyer
does,
and
why
isn't
your
answer,
in
effect,
another
answer
of
the
sort,
they
got
it
wrong
in
applying
their
standard?
i
mean,
you're
saying,
you
know,
what
they
were
really
doing
was
something
other
than
what
the
verbal
formula
suggested,
and
maybe
that's
so,
and
maybe
they
applied
their
verbal
formula
wrongly,
but
is
the
formula
itself,
is
the
statement
of
the
standard
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
may
i
put
my
question
in
a
different
way?
i
think
it's
the
same
question
that
justice
breyer
has
been
asking.
here
are
two
ways
of
looking
at
the
problem,
and
after
i've
stated
the
two
ways
i'm
going
to
ask
you
whether
there
is
anything
other
than
a
verbal
difference
between
them.
one
way
of
looking
at
the
problem
of
trying
to
derive
a
standard
would
be
this
way.
there
is
only
one
standard
for
the
appellate
court
to
apply,
and
it's
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
when
applying
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
to
a
denial
of
a
new
trial,
it's
fairly
easy,
because
we
place
great
weight
on
the
jury
verdict
itself.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
when
applying
the
abuse
standard
to
a
jury
verdict...
i'm
sorry,
to
an
appellate...
to
a
trial
court
decision
that
grants
a
new
trial,
that
vacates
the
verdict,
we
have
to
look
very
carefully
at
the
facts
and
the
record
for
the
simple
reason
that
we
do
have
great
respect
for
the
jury
verdict.
in
each
case,
we're
applying
the
same
standard,
abuse
of
discretion,
but
in
the
two
cases
we
have
to
look
to
different
kinds,
or
at
least
to
different
degrees
of
factual
data.
that's
one
way
of
looking
at
it.
another
way
of
looking
at
it
is
to
say,
when
a
trial
court
in
effect
denies
a
new
trial,
we
say,
well,
abuse
of
discretion.
that's
all
we
look
at.
but
when
a
trial
court
grants
the
new
trial
we
engage
in
reviewing
it
in
a
more
searching
inquiry
because,
in
fact,
we
have
great
respect
for
the
jury
verdict.
is
there
any
difference,
except
a
verbal
difference,
between
those
two
ways
of
looking
at
what
an
appellate
court
does
when
it
reviews
a
trial
court's
decision?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
you
would
be
satisfied
in
this
case
for
us
simply
to
say
there
is
a
difference
between
the
jnov
standard
and
the
great
weight
of
the
evidence
standard.
you
can
answer
that
yes
or
no
and
then
sit
down.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
you
also
accept
the
distinction
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
whether
an
issue
of
damages
can
go
to
the
jury,
i.e.,
is
there
enough
evidence
to
get
it
to
the
jury,
and
on
the
other
hand
the
question
whether
the
jury's
verdict
of
damages
should
be
set
aside
as
against
the
great
weight
of
the
evidence
because
it's
excessive.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
isn't
the--
