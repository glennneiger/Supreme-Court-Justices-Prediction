justice

bader

mr.
reischel,
i
wasn't
of
the
view
that
this
turns...
this
power
relates
only
to
the
credibility
of
witnesses.
i
thought
the
judges
exercised
their
determination
to
turn
over
a
jury
verdict
based
on
maybe
a
whole
range
of
things
that
occur
at
trial,
including
a
judge
might
feel,
i
gave
instructions
that
would
pass
muster
with
the
court
of
appeals,
so
they're
reversal-proof,
but
the
jury
didn't
understand
a
damn
word
i
was
saying.
or
a
judge
might
say,
i
excluded
certain
evidence
that
was
favorable
to
the
defendant.
that,
too,
could
survive
appellate
review,
but
on
thinking
it
over
i
should
have
admitted
the
evidence
and,
either
way,
the
court
of
appeals
wouldn't
touch
me.
those
kinds
of
considerations
don't
go
to
credibility
of
witnesses.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
a
sense
that
the
judge
has
that
something
went
wrong
at
this
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
doesn't
that
go
to
the
credibility
of
the
expert,
whether
what
he
relies
on
is
worthy
of
credence
by
the
fact-finder?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
reischel,
i'd
like
to
clear
the
air
on
gasperini,
because
frankly
i
don't
think
it
has
anything
to
do
with
this
case.
i
mean,
gasperini
concerned
new
york's
attempt
to
get
a
handle
on
excessive
damages,
and
it
did
it...
instead
of
having
a
substantive
cap
it
had
a
procedural
way
of
doing
it.
gasperini
said,
new
york
gave
it
to
a
court
of
appeals.
you
can't
do
that
in
a
federal
system
because
courts
of
appeals
can't
always
see
juries.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
only
one
who
can
do
it
is
the
trial
court
judge,
so
gasperini
had
to
do
with
the
control
authority
of
a
trial
court
judge.
it
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
perspective
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
to
take
vis-a-vis
the
trial
court
judge,
and
it
didn't
say
anything
about
the
difference
between,
if
there
is
any
between
grant
or
denial,
so
i
did
not
understand
gasperini
to
address
this
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there's
a
difference,
too,
when
we're
talking
about--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
the
flaw
the
excessive
damages,
or
is
it
some
other
thing
that
went
wrong
so
that
the
wrong
person
won.
here,
i
take
it
it's
the
former,
because
the
judge
said,
remittitur,
or
if
you
won't
take
the
remittitur,
a
new
trial,
and
i
thought
there
was
a
legal
standard
to
govern
remittitur.
that
is,
a
trial
judge
is
supposed
to
set
it
at
the
maximum
amount
that
a
reasonable
jury
could
award
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
presented.
isn't
that
the
standard?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
difference
between
insufficient
evidence,
which
would
be...
it
used
to
be
jnov,
but
now
it's...
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law...
insufficient
evidence
is
jnov.
new
trial
is
something...
is
more
discretion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
emig,
well,
that's
perfectly
appropriate.
that's
what
the
whole
remittitur
thing
is
about.
if
the
judge
thinks
that
the
verdict
is
excessive
the
judge
can
say,
plaintiff,
you
either
take
a
reduction
or
i'm
going
to
order
a
new
trial,
and
that
is
quite
distinct
from,
was
there
sufficient
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
going
back
again
to
the
sufficiency,
and
rule
50
would
never,
if
these
two
standards
were
so
close,
put
the...
put
on
the
district
court
the
very
difficult
chore
of
having
to
say,
now,
if
i
reject
the
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law,
i
have
to
rule
alternatively,
or
if
i
grant
the
motion
for
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
i
have
to
rule
alternatively
on
the
new
trial
motion,
so
that
making
a
district
judge
do
that
would
be
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
if
these
weren't
discrete
inquiries.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
we
shouldn't
dismiss
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
nothing
turns
on
it.
but
there
is
one
feature
of
this,
we
go
back
for
the
seventh
amendment
to
how
things
were
at
common
law,
and
at
common
law,
as
i
understand
it,
the
appellate
bench
had
no
role
at
all
in
any
of
this,
that
it
was
the
trial
court,
it
could
be
the
poll
court
at
westminster,
but
here
it's
kind
of
an
irony
that
the
appellate
court
that
shouldn't
have
been
in
it
at
all
is
exercising
muscle
vis-a-vis
the
trial
court
that
at
common
law
had
the
only
word
on
whether
there
be
a
new
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why,
if
you
were
adhering
to
the
model
at
the
time
that
the
nation
was
formed,
why
wouldn't
you
say
the
appellate
court,
whatever
roles
there
are
in
this,
yours
has
got
to
be
minimal,
because
you
didn't
even
have
a
say
at
common
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
discretion
on
setting
aside
a
verdict
as
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence
was
entirely,
as
i
understand
it,
in
the
hands
of
the
trial
bench.
just,
not
any
errors
of
law
made,
no
errors
in
the
charge,
no
errors,
no
reversible
errors
in
the
admission
of
evidence,
but
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence
was
trial
court
business
and
not
appellate
business.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
one
of
your
arguments
in
answer
to
the
petitioner
was,
petitioner,
you
knew
all
along
that
the
d.c.
circuit
is
applying
a
stricter
standard
when
it's
reviewing
grants
than
when
it
reviews
denial.
you
knew
it,
and
you
didn't
tell
the
d.c.
circuit
when
you
were
before
that
court,
so
it's
too
late.
if
you
knew
that
they
were
going
to
apply
a
stricter
standard
to
grants
than
denials,
you
should
have
told
them,
d.c.
circuit,
don't
do
what
you're
doing
for
30
years.
you
didn't
tell
them
that,
so
you
effectively
forfeited
the
point.
you
made
that
argument
in
your
brief
to
us.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
must
think
that
this
was
a
standard
that
had
some
bite
to
it.
