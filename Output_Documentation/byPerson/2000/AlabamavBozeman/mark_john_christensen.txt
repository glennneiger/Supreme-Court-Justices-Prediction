mr.
mark
john
christensen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
all
courts
that
have
taken
up
the
issue
of
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
have
recognized
the
mandatory
language,
the
only
issue
to
be
resolved
is
whether
or
not
that
language
is
given
effect.
ms.
stewart
stated
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
alabama
joined
the
iad
was
because
there
were
certain
benefits
to
the
state,
and
i
believe
that
there's
a
sort
of
implied
consent
doctrine
that's
at
issue
here
that
if
the
state
joins
the
iad
and
the
prosecutor
takes
the
initiative
to
place
a
detainer,
because
that's
the
only
way
that
this
act
is
activated,
is
by
the
placing
of
a
detainer,
then
they
have
to
be
bound
by
what
the
statute
says.
it's
quite,
quite
clear,
there's
no
room
for
any
real
discretion
in
here.
mr.
mark
john
christensen
justice
souter,
i
don't
believe
that
harmless
error
can
apply
to
a
situation
like
this
where
the
statute
is
so
explicit
not
only
in
what
is
prohibited
but
in
the
consequences
if
one
violates
that.
mr.
mark
john
christensen
there
is
no
harmless
error
provision
in
the
iad.
am
i
misunderstanding
your
question?
mr.
mark
john
christensen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
john
christensen
i
will
go
on
and
state
some
of
the
reasons
that
i
don't
believe
that
harmless
error
does
apply.
the
iad
uses
a
sanction
of
dismissal
with
prejudice
in
three
separate
places.
i
simply
cannot
believe
that
the
legislative
bodies
that
have
adopted
this
merely
overlooked
this
sanction.
i
believe
that
it
says
this
is
an
important
issue.
harmless
error,
even
if
one
were
to
concede
for
the
purposes
of
argument
that
it
applied,
it
would
be
the
state's
burden
to
show
that
something
that
is
so
substantial
within
this
statute,
a
right
that
is
stated
three
separate
places
is...
that
there
was
no
prejudice,
and
that's...
i'm
uncomfortable
with
all
these
federal
courts
that
presume
that
a
short
transfer
is
harmless.
mr.
mark
john
christensen
that
might
be
applicable
in
other
states,
justice
kennedy,
it's
probably
not
in
alabama,
but--
mr.
mark
john
christensen
--a
hurricane,
perhaps.
i
think
there,
that
might
be
a
unique
situation
where,
where
you
might
have
a
legitimate
argument
that
we
didn't
complete
this.
mr.
mark
john
christensen
certainly.
mr.
mark
john
christensen
yes,
it
would
not
be
de
minimis
and
perhaps
not
harmless.
mr.
mark
john
christensen
he
was
in
florida,
yes.
mr.
mark
john
christensen
well,
i
think
that
liberally
construing
the
statute
as
article
ix
calls
for
means
returning
him
to
the
original
jurisdiction,
not
just
to
the
original--
mr.
mark
john
christensen
--yes.
mr.
mark
john
christensen
numerous
courts
have
said
that
this
is
remedial,
it
benefits
the
prisoner
and
ought
to
be
construed
in
favor
of
the
prisoner.
the
council
on
state
governments
also
has
stated
this
although
it
was
a
number
of
years
after
it
originally
proposed
the
legislation.
mr.
mark
john
christensen
it's
somewhat
weaker
than
most
legislative
bodies
or
so
on,
but
it
is
the
group
that
originally
proposed
the
legislation
and
originally
drafted
it.
it's
the
source
of
the
iad
which
has
been
adopted
in
nearly
every
state,
there
are
48
states
plus
the
federal
government
that
have
adopted
this.
mr.
mark
john
christensen
liberally
construed
in
favor
of
the
prisoner
as
a
remedial
statute.
mr.
mark
john
christensen
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
also
benefits
the
states,
and
that's
what
ms.
stewart
acknowledged
in
that
it
provides
them
with
an
expedited
mechanism
for
getting
prisoners
without
going
through
lengthy
extradition
procedures.
it
is
of
benefit
to
them,
and
that's
why
i
mentioned
this
implied
consent,
that
if
they
go
through,
join
this
agreement,
go
through
the
procedures
to
get
the
person
and
are
enjoying
those
benefits,
they
also
have
to
live
by
what--
mr.
mark
john
christensen
--and
in
fact
most
cases
from
all
jurisdictions
that
refer
to
article
iii
where
it
is
the
prisoner
who
initiates
the
transfer,
they
have
to
follow
the
procedures
quite
strictly
or
they
don't,
do
not
get
the
benefits.
it's...
part
of
my
argument
has
been
that
what's
fair
for
one
side--
mr.
mark
john
christensen
--precisely.
mr.
mark
john
christensen
well,
that
running
back
would
be
the
waiver,
which
justice
stevens
had
proposed
as--
mr.
mark
john
christensen
--the
trigger
is
the
change,
the
temporary
custody
pursuant
to
a
detainer.
if
temporary
custody
is
taken
by
the
receiving
state
and--
mr.
mark
john
christensen
--well,
the
legislative
bodies
that
have
adopted
this
have
made
a
legislative
determination
here.
there's
no
room
for
discretion
in
the
statute.
they
say--
mr.
mark
john
christensen
--my
wording
is
in
iv(e),
prior
to
being
returned,
there
must
be
a
trial
prior
to
being
returned
to
the--
mr.
mark
john
christensen
--i
believe
that
you
have
to
read
it
in
context,
you
have
to
go
up
to--
mr.
mark
john
christensen
--(c),
where--
mr.
mark
john
christensen
--from
iv(c),
the
arrival
of
the
prisoner
in
the
receiving
state.
mr.
mark
john
christensen
i
think
so.
i
think
also
since
we
are
on
the
time
period
that's
contained
in
iv(e),
the
120
days,
i
believe
that
that
also
militates
against
a
finding
of
harmless
error
or
a
requirement
that
one
has
to
show
prejudice.
certainly
120
days
is
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
is
going
to
be
nowhere
near
what
the
constitutional
speedy
trial
requirement
would
be.
mr.
mark
john
christensen
justice
stevens,
i
believe
that
it
has
to
be
that
if
they
cross
the
state
line
that--
mr.
mark
john
christensen
--yes,
and
there
is
a
special
provision
in
the
iad
for
that,
justice
kennedy,
where
the
federal
government
can
maintain
custody
of
a
prisoner
and
merely
make
them
available
for
trial
without
turning
over
the
temporary
custody.
that's
not
the
situation
here,
but
that...
in
those
cases,
that
would
be
a
perfectly
good,
logical
ending,
keeping
with
the
statute.
mr.
mark
john
christensen
no,
he
was
in
the
custody
of
the
sheriff
of
covington
county.
mr.
mark
john
christensen
yes,
sir.
now,
if
they
had
wanted
to
send
a
federal
marshal
with
him,
that
would
have
been
one
of
the
prerogatives
of
the
federal
government
as
a
sending
state
in
this
situation.
that's
not
available
when
it's
a
state
to
state
transfer,
but
it
is
when
the
federal
government
is
the
sending
state.
i
would
like
to
talk
about
the
federal
circuits
because
i'm,
even
though
i
concede
that
there
is
a
majority
that
have
said
something
to
the
effect
that
a
brief
transfer
doesn't
harm
a
prisoner's
rehabilitation,
but
i
find
that
those
statements
are
in
many
cases
are
dicta
or
not
persuasive,
and
these
cases
all
tend
to
be
somewhat
incestuous
also
in
that
they
rely
upon
one
another.
the
earliest
is
a
chico
case
from
the
second
circuit
which
would
not
have--
mr.
mark
john
christensen
--i
would
disagree
with
that,
justice
ginsburg,
because
the
act
itself
says
that
it
applies
when
there's
a
detainer
and
someone
has
been
brought
in
for
purposes
of
prosecution.
now,
if
you've
placed
a
detainer
on
someone
for
questioning
or
as
a
witness
in
another
case,
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers
does
not
apply
to
that
because
it
only
applies
to
detainers
that
are
based
on
untried
indictments,
informations,
and
complaints,
but
i
simply--
mr.
mark
john
christensen
--an
arraignment
is
certainly
part
of
a
prosecution.
mr.
mark
john
christensen
certainly.
you
can
have
a
hearing
and
ask
the
prisoner
to
waive.
if
he
waives...
in
fact,
this
court
in
united
states
versus
mauro,
which
is
the
first
iad
case
that
this
court
has
dealt
with,
the
court
clearly
agreed
with
the
idea
that
ford
had
waived
the
antishuttling
provision.
he
had
not
waived
the
speedy
trial
provision,
and
so
this
court
affirmed
the
dismissal
of
his
indictment,
and
i
would
also
point
out
that
that
was
without
any
requirement
that
he
had
been
prejudiced
by
this
and
he
was
brought
to
trial
within
about
five
months
of
having
been
transferred
into
the
receiving
state,
which
is
just
over
the
120
days,
so
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
you
have
dealt
with
this
issue
of
prejudice
before
and
resolved
it
in
favor
of
the
prisoners.
mr.
mark
john
christensen
well,
and
that's
a
presumption
that
is
perhaps
intuitive
but
one
that
i'm
not
convinced
is
borne
out
by
the
facts,
and
in
the
record
below
here
there
simply
is
nothing.
that
issue
was
not
dealt
with.
mr.
mark
john
christensen
mr.
bozeman
has
informed
me
that
he
lost
his
position
as
a
barber
in
the
prison
at
mariana
because
of
the
one
day
transfer,
so
he
was
prejudiced,
although
that's
not
in
the
record
below.
the
state
below--
mr.
mark
john
christensen
--well,
no
more
than
120
days,
justice
breyer,
and
again
i
mentioned
the
short
time
periods
that
are
involved
here.
it
envisions,
i
believe,
those
time
periods
because
they're
sufficient
to
take
care
of
all
pretrial
matters
within
that
time.
he's
sitting
there,
he
gets
it
taken
care
of,
and
of
course
article
i,
in
stating
the
purposes,
says
that
the
purpose
is
to
resolve
detainers.
bring
someone
in
for
arraignment,
send
him
back,
the
detainer
is
still
there,
and
the
harm
caused
by
the
detainer
is
still
there,
and
that
is--
mr.
mark
john
christensen
--well,
again,
with
the
120
days
there
is
a
provision
that
continuances
can
be
granted
for
good
cause
shown.
now,
in
the
antishuttling
clause,
there
is
no
parallel
construction
there
with
the
state.
there's
no
provision
that
we're
going
to
shuttle
you
over
your
objection.
however,
the
federal
government
provision
would
allow
that
by
reading
the
federal
amendment,
the
article
ix,
which
says
if
there's
a
hearing
and
the
court
orders
that
you're
sent
back,
that's
not
a
violation,
but
that's
only
applying
to
the
federal
government
as
a
receiving
state.
it's
not
in
the
main
body
of
the
iad,
and
i
think
that
that
is
significant
in
terms
of
the
statutory
construction.
in
fact,
i
think
it
would
be
to
run
rough
shod
over
the
text
to
simply
ignore
it.
mr.
mark
john
christensen
the
more
time
to
confer
with
his
counsel
or?
i
certainly
would
think
that.
in
this
case
there
was
very
little
opportunity
to
confer
with
counsel.
if
i
could
turn
back
to
these
federal
cases,
the
chico
case,
mr.
chico
was
transferred
for
arraignment,
transferred
back,
and
then
transferred
back
to
plead
guilty.
he
did
not
appeal.
he
made
no
objection
to
the
transfer.
he
was
transferred
pursuant
to
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
prosequendum
rather
than
as
a
detainer.
this
was
before
this
court
had
dealt
with
mauro.
then
when
he
had
a
probation
violation,
he
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
asking
that
the
iad
be
recognized.
in
reed
v.
farley,
this
court
has
held
that
habeas
corpus
is
not
something
that
can
be
used
to
recognize
violations
of
the
iad,
so
that
would
simply
not
apply.
this
case
is
then
cited
as
justification
in
another
second
circuit
case,
the
roy
case,
mr.
roy
had
so
many
detainers
from
so
many
different
jurisdictions
that
i
feel
quite
certain
that
the
second
circuit
was
looking
for
any
reason
whatsoever
to
keep
from
excusing
him.
mr.
roy
had
another
case
in
the
seventh
circuit
which
referred
to
the
second
circuit
case
and
to
the
chico
case,
and
in
fact
the
same
transfer
was
complained
about
in
the
second
circuit
and
in
the
seventh
and
the
second
circuit
cases.
the
taylor
case
that
mr.
lamken
mentioned
does
say
that
a
brief
transfer
doesn't
happen,
but
the
prisoner
there
asked
to
be
transferred
back
to
state
custody.
there's
quite
clearly
a
waiver,
although
the
court
for
some
inexplicable
reason
doesn't
seem
to
reach
that.
that's
a
first
circuit
case.
the
fifth
circuit
sassoon
case
is
also
was
raised
on
habeas
corpus,
and
in
fact
it
was
raised
on
habeas
corpus
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
sassoon
had
not
appealed
the
issue
following
his
conviction.
sixth
circuit
taylor
case,
many
of
these
people
for
some
unknown
reason
seem
to
be
named
taylor,
the
court
there
held
that
since
he
was
held
in
a
jail
and
hadn't
been
transferred
to
a
prison
yet,
that
there
was
no
violation,
and
then
adds,
and
besides,
all
these
other
courts
hold
that
quick,
temporary
transfers
do
not
violate
the
iad.
it
mentions
article
ix
of
the
federal
amendment
in
a
footnote
but
doesn't
rely
on
it.
i
find
it
somewhat
inexplicable
that
these
courts
have
this
federal
amendment
available
to
them,
but
it's
evidently
not
being
used
because
none
of
the
opinions
that
i've
found
have
done
more
than
mention
it
in
a
footnote.
mr.
mark
john
christensen
yes,
sir.
mr.
mark
john
christensen
yes,
all
these
are
cases
where
the
united
states
was
the
receiving
state.
the
eighth
circuit
baxter
case
mentions
this
but
it's
again
citing
chico,
taylor,
and
roy,
but
it
really
resolves
the
issue
on
the
fact
that
mr.
baxter
was
transferred
by
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
prosequendum
before
a
detainer
had
been
lodged,
so
it
really
doesn't
add
to
the
argument
other
than
to
saying,
yes,
us,
too,
and
the
ninth
circuit
johnson
case
simply
comes
down
saying
well,
we've
looked
through
and
this
is
what
the
majority
thinks,
and
we
think
that
also.
i
would
also
point
out
that
another
reason
i
believe
this
cannot
be
de
minimis
or
harmless
error
is
that
we
tend
to
focus
in
on
the
phrase,
the
court
shall
enter
an
order
dismissing
with
prejudice,
but
there's
also
a
self
executing
clause
in
there,
it
seems
that
by
the
transfer
itself,
ex
operi
operato,
the
indictment
becomes
without
further
effect.
now,
that
is
something
that
i
believe
that
it
requires
an
objection
prior
to
trial
to
preserve
that,
just
like
any
sort
of
defect
in
an
indictment
would
require,
yet
it's
not
something
that
you
can
apply
harmless
error
or
de
minimis
analysis
to.
if
the...
it
seems
somewhat
redundant
to
have,
then
having
the
court
enter
a
ruling
dismissing
the
charge
but
i
believe
that
that's
to
prevent
the
prosecutor
from
coming
back
and
reindicting
on
these
same
charges,
and
it
also
recognizes
that
there
really
is
no
indictment,
self
executing
clauses
being
somewhat
difficult
to
enforce
otherwise.
i
would
also
point
out,
it's
not
very
difficult
for
the
states
to
follow
these
rules.
it's
laid
out
quite
clearly.
in
this
particular
case,
as
i
have
set
out
in
the
red
brief,
the
prosecutor
had
ample
opportunity
to
know
what
the
statute
said
and
to
follow
the
rules.
she
even
had
notice
from
mr.
bozeman
himself
who
had
filed
a
pro
se
motion
objecting
to
a
prior
transfer
that
said
the
iad
requires
dismissal.
it's...
to
excuse
that
is
simply,
i
believe,
would
be
saying
that
a
prosecutor
can
do
whatever
he
or
she
pleases
and
that
they
hope
to
be
able
to
get
away
with
it
by
claiming
that
it's
harmless.
as
a
practical
matter,
a
trial
court
judge
is
almost
always
going
to
rule
that
an
error
is
harmless.
he's
going
to
rule
against
the
prosecutor
unless
there
is
some
real
teeth
given
to
the
wording
of
the
statute.
mr.

christensen
against
the
defendant.
well,
it
is
a
sanction,
i
suppose,
against
the
prosecutor
and
they
understandably
don't
like
that
because
it's
so
rare
that
that
happens,
and
as
a
defense
lawyer,
it
gives
me
that
small
bit
of
cheer
to
occasionally
have
the
upper
hand.
and
also,
this
statute
provides
a
bright
line.
i
think
that
there
are
going
to
be
endless
hearings
on
whether
or
not
harm
has
taken
place
if
this
court
rules
that
harmless
error
can
apply.
if
you
rule
that
the
strict
language
applies,
the
court
needn't...
merely
see,
has
there
been
a
transfer,
and
if
so,
has
there
been
a
waiver.
mr.
mark
john
christensen
i
think
that
it
would
be
something
along
the
lines
of
rehabilitation,
even
though
this
purpose
of
the
iad
is
to
resolve
detainers,
i
think
the
background
behind
that
is
that
detainers
interfere
with
rehabilitation.
thank
you.
