ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court--
we
are
here
today
not
because
a
possibly
innocent
man
was
unjustly
convicted
nor
are
we
here
because
he
was
possibly
denied
a
constitutional
right
nor
are
we
even
here
because
he
possibly
was
denied
one
of
the
rudimentary
demands
of
a
fair
trial.
we
are
simply
here
today
to
resolve
whether
or
not
a
guilty
man
should
escape
his
just
punishment
as
a
result
of
a
technical
violation
of
a
statute.
specifically,
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
or
not
michael
bozeman
is
entitled
to
have
his,
was
entitled
to
have
his
indictment
dismissed
with
prejudice
as
a
result
of
a
one
day
transfer
from
federal
custody
into
state
custody
for
purposes
of
arraignment
and
appointment
of
counsel.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
clearly
the
language,
when
it's
read
in
isolation,
seems
to
indicate
that
the
indictment
must
be
dismissed
with
prejudice--
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
--but
the
language
simply
can't
be
read
in
isolation.
it
has
to
be
read
against
the
background
principle
of
harmless
error,
which
was
in
existence
at
the
time
the
iad
was
passed.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
well,
there's
a
question
whether
or
not
the
parties
to
the
agreement
can
actually
amend
the
agreement.
this
is
not
a...
this
is
an
interstate
compact
involving
48
different
states.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
they
would
have
to
go
to
their
legislature
and
repeal
participation.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
yes,
according
to
the
act
itself,
it
could
withdraw
from
the
whole
act
itself,
but
to
do
so
it
would
have
to
give
up
certain
rights
that
are
bestowed
upon
it
in
the
act
that
are
very
beneficial
to
the
states
in
disposing
of
detainers.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
congress
could
not
unilaterally
change
the
provision
of
the
compact.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
congress
did
do
it
in
section
9
of
the
agreement,
but
when
congress
passed
the
original
agreement
in
section
7,
they
reserved
to
themselves
the
right
to
amend
the
agreement.
other
states,
specifically
alabama,
do
not
have
such
a
reservation
clause
in
the
agreement,
which
would
make
it
more
difficult
certainly
to
amend
the
agreement.
now,
there
are
some
other
states
that
have
amended
the
agreement
unilaterally,
but
it's
not
been
challenged
whether
or
not
that
was
permitted...
permissible
under
the
agreement
itself.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
well,
the
state
adopted
the
agreement
partially...
certainly
because
of
the
benefits
to
it,
but
it
also
adopted
the
agreement
against
the
background
principle
that
harmless
errors
shouldn't
apply.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
have
a
case
where
this
court
has
specifically
held
harmless
error
applicable
where
there
is
a
specific
type
of
remedy
such
as
this
contained
within
the
agreement.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
i
do
not
know
of
a
case
where
that
has
been
done.
however,
i
would
say,
number
one,
that
an
intentional
violation
act
would
certainly,
whether
or
not
it
was
intentional,
would
be
a
part
of
the
harmless
error
analysis,
and
here
i
don't
think
there
was
an
intentional
act
whatsoever.
i
think
the
prosecutor
simply
misread
the
act
and
dropped
the
ball,
and
as
a
result
mr....
if
this
court
holds
that
dismissal
is
required,
then
of
course
then
the
result,
the
purposes
of
this
act
have
not
been
maintained--
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
--mr.
justice
souter,
i
am
making
the
broader
argument
that
harmless
error
should
apply
to
a
statute
unless
there's
an
indication
of
an
intent
contrary
to
it
that
says
that
harmless
error
should
not
apply,
and
it's
my
position
that
this
statute
does
not
indicate
such
an
intent
that
harmless
error
should
not
apply.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
excuse
me?
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
normally
article
iv
works
that
you
bring
the
prisoner
over
and
you
have
120
days
within
which
to
try
him.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
right.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
that's
correct.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
under
the
act,
that
is
the
purposes,
he's
supposed
to...
if
you
read
the
language
in
its
technical,
in
its...
on
its
face,
then,
yes,
that
seems
to
be
the
only
purpose
which
you
can
bring
him
to.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
that
seems
to
be
the
theory,
if
you
read
it,
on
its
face.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
but
certainly,
no--
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
--i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
absolutely.
and
that
is
why
this
individual
was
brought
to
alabama,
to
have
the
appointment
of
counsel.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
certainly.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
and
the
state
of
alabama's
position
is,
no,
you
don't
always
have
to
keep
them
there.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
i
think
that's
not
what
it
says.
i
think
that
there's
enough
ambiguity
in
the
statute
that
is
not
required
that
you
keep
them
there
until
trial.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
right.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
right.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
yes.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
certainly.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
certainly
he
can
be
brought
to
another
state
just
for
questioning
or
for
other
purposes,
but
the
position
of
mr.
bozeman
is
that
under
the
act
you
can
only
bring
him
for
trial.
the
position
of
the
state
is
that,
no,
there
are
other
reasons
you
can
bring
him
under
detainer
to
alabama.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
no,
that's
not
the
question
that's
presented
today,
justice
kennedy.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
and
certainly
this
act
was
passed,
this
remedial
legislation,
it
was
passed
specifically
to
address
certain
problems
that
occurred
as
a
result
of
detainers,
there
being
no
formal
procedures,
and
there
being
no
way
to
bring
an
inmate
into
a
state
and
have
the
detainers
disposed
of,
and
to
do
so
in
such
a
way
that
it
didn't
interfere
with
the
rights
to
rehabilitation,
that's
the
specific
purposes
behind
this
act.
article
ix
of
the
act
specifically
says
that
it
should
be
construed
in
such
a
way
as
to
effectuate
those
purposes,
and
to
construe
this
act
as
requiring
dismissal
of
the
indictment
is
not
going
to
effectuate
those
purposes.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
supposedly
you
could,
you
know,
theoretically
you
certainly
could
ask
for
a
waiver,
but
that
is
not
what
happened
in
this
case,
and
it
shouldn't
be
required
that
you
ask
for
a
waiver
in
order
to--
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
--we
could
give
the
person
the
choice,
but
certainly
again
that
could
just
simply
lead
to
more
litigation,
and
whether
or
not
he
understood
what
he
was
waiving
and
what
right
he
had,
and
also
we
have
to
get
him
here
practically
in
alabama,
the
practical
way,
you
have
to
get
the
person
into
alabama
before
you
can
appoint
counsel.
there
are
ways
to
appoint
counsel
in
advance
of
bringing
the
person
to
alabama,
but
the
practicalities--
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
--yes,
he
did,
justice
stevens.
certainly
that's
one
way
that
this
act
could
be
implemented,
but
the
state's
position
is
that
that's
not
required
under
the
act
because
simply
the
transfer
did
not
violate--
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
--right.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
and
of
course
this
court,
at
the
time
that
this
case
was
decided
and
at
the
time
we
were
talking
about
whether
or
not
mr.
bozeman,
whether
his
rights
had
been
violated
by
the
transfer,
this
court
had
not
decided
new
york
v.
hill
and
decided
whether
or
not
waiver
applied
to
the
act,
and
similarly
the
argument
made
there
was
that
because
the
act
said
that
it
shall
be,
that
if
there's
a
violation
of
the
120-day
provision
that
the
act
shall
be...
or
the
indictment
shall
be
dismissed
with
prejudice,
that
waiver
shouldn't
apply
because
and
that
the
act
specifically
should
say
whether
it
should
or
shouldn't.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
i
think
there
is
a
significance
in
that
that
case
involved
waiver,
but
it's
not
for
the
purposes
of
the
argument
that
i'm
making
which
is
that
the
iad
was
silent
on
whether
or
not
waiver
principles
applied
to
it,
just
as
it's
silent
as
to
whether
or
not
harmless
error
principles
apply
to
it.
this
court
held
that
because
it
was
silent
and
because
the
general
principle,
there's
a
presumption
that
waiver
applies
that
waiver
should
apply
there.
similarly,
i'm
arguing
that
because
harmless
error
is,
there's
a
presumption
that
it
applies
to
statutes
as
well
as
to
constitutional
errors
that
it
should
apply
in
this
case.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
i
don't
think
that
every
case
would
result
in
harmful
error.
certainly
in
this
case
is
a
perfect
example
where
there
was
no
harm...
i'm
sorry,
i
got
that
back--
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
--certainly
there
are
cases
where
there
would
be
harm
to
the
defendant
by
the
transfer,
for
instance
in
alabama
there
are
like
2600
inmates
involved
in
drug
programs,
and
there's
currently
a
waiting
list
of
800.
under
the
i...
if
an
inmate
were
transferred
to
another
jurisdiction
for
a
single
day
or
maybe
two
days,
he
wouldn't
lose
his
place
in
line
to
become
involved
in
this
program,
so
if
he
was
transferred
for
the
entire
period,
say,
to
a
federal
jurisdiction
to
await
trial,
he
would
lose
his
place
and
lose
his
opportunity
to
participate
in
those
programs,
which
could
specifically
prevent
him
from
participating--
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
--i
do
think
that
there
is
a
situation
where
you
could
bring
somebody
just
for
one
day
and
there
could
be
harm
to
them,
if
they
weren't
involved
specifically,
say,
it
was
the
time
to
take
a
ged,
for
instance,
was
that
day,
and
they
couldn't
take
it
as
a
result,
and
it
wouldn't
be
given
for,
you
know,
another
year
or
something
along
that
lines,
it
would
be
harm
to
the
defendant,
so
there
could
be
harm
from
a
single
day
transfer.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
that
is
certainly
one
of
the
issues
that
is
encompassed.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
sandra
jean
stewart
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
a
few
points.
i
wanted
to
point
out,
the
respondent
has
conceded
that
there
are
some
exceptions
to
the
actual
wording
of
section,
of
article
iv(e),
he
has
conceded
that
the
language
is
not
that
clear
and
that
there
might
have
to
be
some
construction
of
that
statute
in
order
to
make
it
effectuate
its
purposes.
also,
it's
very
important
to
point
out
that
the
agreement
was
not
just
for
the
benefit
of
the
prisoner
here,
this
agreement
was
entered
into
for
the
benefit
of
the
party
states
as
well
as
for
the
benefit
of
the
prisoner,
and
that
purpose
is
specifically
stated
in
article
i,
and
it
is
one
of
the
purposes
that
needs
to
be
considered
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
harmless
error
analysis
should
apply.
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question
about
waiver
and
whether
or
not
we
could
just
have
the
prisoner
waive,
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
the
respondent
has
argued
that
one
of
the
problems
with
implementing
harmless
error
is
it
would
lead
to
additional
litigation
in
the
trial
courts,
and
i
would
point
out
that
if
we
have
a
hearing
every
time
we
need
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
prisoner
wants
to
waive
the
right,
then
again
we're
going
to
have
additional
litigation,
so
either
way
we're
going
to
come
up
with
additional
litigation.
in
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question
about
what's
the
purpose
behind
article
iv(e),
i
think
it's
simply
meant
to
implement
article
iv(c),
and
it's
a
way
to
bring
the
prisoner
over,
and
we
need
to
have
him
here,
dispose
of
the
charges,
and
bring
him
back,
but
i
don't
think
the
purpose
is
to
give
the
prisoner
some
sort
of
benefit,
some
sort
of
way
to
have
the
charges
disposed
of
short
of
a
trial.
finally,
mr.
bozeman
made
no
argument
below
about
harm
and
that
he
suffered
any
harm,
so
it
should
not
be
considered
here,
and
if
this
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
thank
you.
