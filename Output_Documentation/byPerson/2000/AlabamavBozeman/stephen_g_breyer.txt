we

justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
we
know
it's
harmless?
what's
the
point
of
article
vi?
it's
hard
to...
what
is
it
contemplating?
there's
a
person
in
another
state,
you
want
to
try
him.
now,
you're
not
supposed
to
bring
him
out
of
that
state
until
you're
ready
to
go
to
trial?
how
does
it
normally
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you're
going
to
put
him
in
the
county
jail?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
have
the
indictment
before
you
get
him,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what's
he
coming
for,
just
the
trial?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
only
reason
that
a
state...
joe
smith
is
in
california.
now,
you're
going
to
use
this
act,
you're
bringing
him,
you're
under
this
act
in
article
vi,
you
don't
even
want
to
see
him
until
you're
ready
to
go
to
trial,
is
that
the
theory
of
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
now
might
you
sometimes--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--have
to
see
him
in
alabama
before
you
go
to
trial?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
trials
work
in
that
state?
don't
you
sometimes
have
to
see
a
defendant
before
he
goes
to
trial?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
this
must
come
up
all
the
time,
i
mean,
you
bring
a
person
into
the
state,
we
say
it's
not,
we're
not
ready
for
trial
yet,
but
we're
going
to
the
arraignment
or
we're
going
to
have
a
hearing
on
suppression
or
a
lot
of
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
what
are
they
thinking
in
this,
there
might
be
lots
of
instances
where
there
are
days
that
pass
between
bringing
him
into
the
state
and
trying
him,
and
what's
supposed
to
happen
in
that
time?
are
you
supposed
to
always
keep
him
in
a
county
jail,
even
if
you're
in
maryland,
and
in
fact
the
other
prison
happens
to
be
two
feet
away
in
virginia?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
what
it
says.
so
what
are
they
thinking?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
reason
i
ask
is
the
only
sense
i
can
make
out
of
it,
given
the
realities,
is
this
is
some
kind
of
prophylactic
rule,
and
the
prophylactic
rule
would
be,
we
know
it's
nutty
in
a
lot
of
circumstances,
but
nonetheless
the
only
way
to
get
the
states
to
move
off
the
dime
is
to
insist
that
they
try
him
before
they
send
him
back,
even
if
the
jail's
next
door
to
the
prison
he
came
from.
now,
if
it's
a
prophylactic
rule,
you
don't
have
a
de
minimis
violation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
would
a
long
interruption
be
worse?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
would
a
long
interruption
be
worse?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the...
the
interruption
part
wouldn't.
i
mean,
if
he
was
in
the
county
jail
for
a
month
or
a
year
and
then
they
sent
him
back,
the
sending
back
wouldn't
cause
any
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
doesn't
actually
literally,
if
you
take,
if
you
were
a
literalist,
and
you
look
at
(e),
it
doesn't
say
where
it
begins
to
run.
it
says
if
trial
is
not
had
on
any
indictment.
it
doesn't
say...
well,
i
mean,
when
if
not
trial?
it
just
doesn't
say.
so
we
have
quite
a
lot
of
flexibility
as
to
what
we
might
read
in
there.
i
take
it
that
they
want
to
us
say,
in
any
instance
where
imprisonment
in
the
original
state
is
significantly
interrupted,
then
if.
all
right,
so
what's
your
candidate
for
when
it
starts
to
run?
you
want
to
say
in
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical,
if
subject
to
a
detainer
the
prisoner
puts
one
foot
out
the
door
and
immediately
runs
back,
then
if
trial
is
not
had
before
he
ran
back,
i
mean,
how
do
we
fill
in
that?
that's
a
total
blank.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
my
question
is,
what
triggers
(e)?
(e)
doesn't
say
what
triggers
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
now,
what
they
want
to
do
is
just
say
you're
right,
if
significant
temporary
custody
where
significant
is
interpreted
in
light
of
the
purposes
of
the
law,
that's
what
they
want
to
do,
and
so
literalism
isn't
going
to
help
because
neither
literally
is
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sorry,
my
question
is,
what
language
says
that
you
said
if
and
your
language
was
what?
if
there
is
an
interruption.
it
doesn't
say
that
in
(e).
there
is
no
language
in
(e),
if
there
is
an
interruption.
you're
making
up
the
whole
thing
to
read
into
it.
by
the
way,
i
think
you're
right,
something
like
that
must
be
read
into
it,
but
literally
where
you
get
the
words,
you're
reading
into
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
prior
to
being
returned,
but
once
what,
prior
to
being
returned?
once
he
sets
a
foot
out
the
door?
there
is
nothing
there
that
tells
us
when
(e)
begins
to
run.
once
what?
once
he
leaves?
once
he
leaves
any
day?
once
he
leaves
to
visit
his
grandmother?
it's
obviously
not
that.
it's
something.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
exactly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
have
to
read
it
in
context,
and
now
my
question
is
what
are
the
words
that
you're
reading
in
in
context?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
maybe
that's
it.
i
can
read
those,
but
you
don't
want
to
say...
okay,
maybe
that's
the
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
really
see,
still,
the
theory
of
(e).
i
mean,
what
are
they
trying
to
do?
once
the
person
gets
out,
you
know,
once
you
take
the
prisoner
in
for
a
preliminary
proceeding
or
something,
it
interferes
with
his
rehabilitation
in
the
initial
prison
more
rather
than
less
to
keep
him
in
the
state.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
asking
for
your
experience
as
a
criminal
lawyer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
not
what
i
mean.
i
don't
mean
in
this
case.
i
mean
in
your
general
experience,
having
looked
at
all
these
statutes,
what's
your
view
of
what
the
theory
of
this
thing
is?
how
is
it
really
supposed
to
work
because
intuitively
i'd
think
that
a
person
who
comes
from
a
preliminary
hearing,
the
longer
he
stays
away,
the
worse
things
are,
but
this
provision
seems
to
force
the
state
to
keep
him
away.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
first
case
alabama
v.
bozeman,
it
concerns
a
state
that
wants
to
prosecute
a
person
who
is
currently
serving
a
criminal
sentence
for
a
different
crime
in
a
different
state.
now,
in
those
circumstances
the
state
wanting
to
get
the
person
for
prosecution
will
likely
file
a
detainer,
which
is
a
legal
document
that
tells
the
state
where
he
is
imprisoned
to
hold
him
and
produce
him
for
trial
later
on
in
the
prosecuting
state.
an
interstate
compact,
which
has
been
joined
by
the
federal
government
among
the
others
almost
every
state,
sets
forth
procedures
as
to
how
this
has
to
be
done.
now,
this
case
concerns
a
compact
provision
that
says,
that
once
the
prisoner
the
defendants
in
the
new
case
who
is
currently
imprisoned
in
the
sending
state,
arrives
in
the
receiving
state,
he
must
be
tried
within
a
120
days
but
“if
trial
is
not
had
prior
to
the
prisoners
being
returned
to
the
original
place
of
imprisonment
that
is
in
the
sending
state,
the
indictment
shall
not
be
of
any
further
force
or
effect
and
the
court
shall
dismiss
it
with
prejudice.”
now,
in
this
case
the
sending
state,
which
happens
to
be
the
federal
government
here,
sent
its
prisoner
michael
bozeman
from
the
federal
prison
in
florida
to
covington
county,
alabama
80
miles
away
for
trial
on
state
charges.
bozeman
was
held
overnight
in
the
county
jail,
he
went
through
various
court
preliminaries
and
the
next
day
he
was
returned
after
one
day
to
federal
prison
in
florida
where
he
remained
until
subsequently
he
was
brought
back
to
alabama
for
trial,
not
surprisingly
he
pointed
out
that
his
earlier
return
to
federal
prison
before
his
state
trial
had
been
held
violated
the
compact.
the
judge
believing
that
it
made
a
lot
of
sense
to
return
bozeman
to
federal
prison
instead
of
keeping
him
in
the
county
jail
refused
to
dismiss
the
state
charges.
a
closely
divided
supreme
court
in
alabama
reversed,
and
we
are
reviewing
the
matter.
now,
everybody
agrees
that
the
“returned
of
bozeman”
to
the
original
place
of
imprisonment
before
trial
was
had
violates
the
acts
literal
language.
but
alabama,
supported
by
the
federal
government,
argues
that
seen
in
terms
of
the
compacts
basic
purposes,
minimizing
interference
with
the
sending
state’s
prison
rehabilitation
programs.
the
violation
here
was
trivial
for
the
pre-trial
interruption
of
bozeman’s
federal
prison
stay
only
lasted
a
day.
but
as
we
see
the
matter
the
act's
language
is
absolute,
it
says
that
in
circumstances
like
those
present
here
the
indictment
shall
not
be
of
any
further
force
or
effect
and
the
indictment
shall
be
dismissed
with
prejudice.
neither
can
we
say
that
the
violation
viewed
in
terms
of
the
provisions
basic
purpose
was
trivial.
if
the
provision
wants
to
stop
the
shuttling
of
prisoners
back
and
forth
between
prisons
we
note
bozeman
was
improperly
shuttled
at
least
once,
and
although
his
federal
prison
rehabilitation
program
was
interrupted
only
briefly
that
fact
could
not
relate
at
least
not
directly
to
the
basic
purpose.
after
all
the
return
of
a
prisoner
to
an
initial
place
of
imprisonment
whether
after
a
day
or
a
week
or
a
month
away,
will
always
mean
more
time
within
the
federal
sending
state
program
not
less
time
and
seen
in
terms
of
any
other
rehabilitation
related
purpose
say
if
the
compact
is
trying
to
impose
on
alabama
an
incentive
to
try
this
person
quickly
by
imposing
county
jail
cause
will
viewed
in
terms
of
a
purpose
like
that
bozeman’s
return
was
not
harmless.
as
we
explained
further
in
our
opinion
for
these
and
related
reasons
we
conclude
that
the
compact
requires
dismissal
of
bozeman’s
indictment
and
we
affirm
the
alabama
supreme
court's
similar
determination.
our
determination
is
unanimous
although
justice
scalia
and
justice
thomas
do
not
join
one
portion
of
our
opinion.
