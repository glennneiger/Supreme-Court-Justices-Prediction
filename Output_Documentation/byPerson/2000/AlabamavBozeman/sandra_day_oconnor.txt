justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
the
clear
provision
of
article
iv(e)
of
the
interstate
agreement,
here,
on
detainments.
it
couldn't
be
more
clearly
provided
in
there
that
the
court
shall
enter
an
order
dismissing
with
prejudice
an
indictment
or
complaint
if
he
isn't
tried
immediately.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
that's
what
it
says.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
would
think
you
maybe
ought
to
just
seek
an
amendment
of
the
agreement.
it's
just
clear.
