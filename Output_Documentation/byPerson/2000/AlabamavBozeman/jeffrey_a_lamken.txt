mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
as
the
majority
of
federal
courts
have
held,
a
brief
interruption
in
a
prisoner's
confinement
does
not
require
dismissal
of
the
state
indictment
against
the
prisoner
under
article
iv(e)
of
the
interstate
agreement
on
detainers.
those
decisions
are
correct,
and
the
rule
of
de
minimis
is
of
particular--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--pardon?
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
there
are
two
reasons,
your
honor.
first,
a
long
interruption
would
often
cause
the
prisoner
to
lose
his
place
in
programs
and
then
he
would
also,
may
lose
his
priority--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
our
view
is
that
the
interruption
is
what
is
de
minimis
in
this
case,
and
when
the
interruption
is
merely
for
an
overnight
period,
it
does
not
cause
a
disruption
in
the
inmate's
participation
in
programs
of
rehabilitation
in
the
original
institution
of
confinement.
if
there
was
a
long
period
of
interruption,
in
contrast,
the
inmate
would
have
to
start
over
in
the
programs
or
could
possibly
lose
his
place
as
priority
of
the
programs,
depending
on
the
institution,
so
we
believe
that,
yes,
in
fact,
there
could
be
a
longer
interruption
that
would
cause
harm
to
the--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--in
an
ideal
world,
yes,
they
would
get
waivers,
but
in
our
experience
this
situation
arises
because
of
miscommunications.
for
example,
in
a
case
called
united
states
v.
taylor,
the
united
states
marshal
service
placed
a
detainer
on
the
prisoner,
and
the
united
states
attorney's
office
was
not
aware
of
that
detainer.
consequently,
when
they
obtained
custody
of
the
prisoner,
they
said...
the
magistrate
specifically
asked,
is
there
a
detainer
on
this
prisoner?
and
the
u.s.
attorney
said,
no.
they
sent
the
prisoner
back,
not
realizing
that--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--of
course,
your
honor,
but
the
rule
of
de
minimis
that
when
the
event
is
so
insubstantial
in
relationship
to
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
the
law
does
not
take
cognizance
of
it,
and
a
single
overnight
transfer,
like
the
one
at
issue
here,
is
insubstantial
in
relationship
to
the
purposes
of
the
prohibition,
and
that
purpose
is
to
ensure
rehabilitation
of
the
prisoner
and
the
prisoner's
participation
in
the
rehabilitation
program.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
your
honor,
it's
not
a
complete
answer
for
two
reasons.
first,
one,
oftentimes
prisoners
would
prefer
that
there
is
a
mistake
and
that
they
actually
got
sent
back
and
the
indictment
be
dismissed,
and
second,
there
is
an
interest
in
the
institution,
the
sending
institution
in
receiving
the
prisoner
back
because
it's
the
state's
interest
to
ensure
that
its
prisoners
are
undergoing
the
rehabilitation
programs
that
they
are
providing,
and
when
the
prisoner
is
away
for
an
undue
period
of
time,
such
as
the
sometimes
lengthy
period
between
arraignment
and
trial,
they
are
not
participating
in
those
numerous
programs,
and
it
is
to
the
state's
detriment,
and
so
in
that
sense,
although
we
often
rely
on
the
prisoner
as
in
the
context
of
waiver
to--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--the
act
has
twin
purposes,
and
the
two
purposes
are,
one,
to
set
up
a
system
of
an
expeditious
system
whereby
states
could
obtain
prisoners
from
other
jurisdictions
and
exact
their
punishment
or
impose
the
penalties
prescribed
by
law,
and
the
other
purpose
was
to
ensure
that
while
they
were
doing
that
it
did
not
unduly
interfere
with
the
state
that
had
the
prisoner
in
its
confinement
and
its
programs
of
rehabilitation,
so
it
should
have
been--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--your
honor,
if
one
were
to
read
the
language
quite
literally,
they
could
have
sent
him
to
a
federal
institution,
for
example,
in
some
other
part
of
alabama,
and
it
would
not
have
invoked
the
literal
language
of
the
statute,
and
dismissal
would
not
have
been
required.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
it
is
a
rather
poorly
drafted
agreement
in
that
respect,
but
because
it
is
an
agreement,
because
it
is--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that's
not
where
he
originally
came
from,
and
that
situation
occurs,
for
example,
where
the
united
states
marshals
retain
custody
of
a
high
security
prisoner,
as
they
have
the
right
to
do,
when
they
have
concerns
that
the
state
may
not
have
appropriate
facilities,
that
they
would
retain
that
prisoner
potentially
in
another
location
other
than
that
one
of
original
confinement.
it
is
not
a
well
drafted
agreement,
but
it
is
at
its
core
a
contract,
an
agreement
among
the
states,
and
for
that
reason
the
sometimes
more
flexible
terms
of
construction
applicable
to
contracts,
such
as
breach
and
performance,
are
applicable
here,
given
the
harsh
consequences
of
a
violation,
complete
frustration
of
the
state's
efforts
to
enforce
its
criminal
law,
we
believe
that
the
rule
of
de
minimis
is
of
particular
force
in
this
context.
it
seems
unlikely
that
the
states
meant
to
abrogate
the
principle
of
de
minimis
in
light
of
that
harsh
consequence.
in
addition--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--indeed,
when
congress
enacted
that
special
provision,
the
courts
were
divided
4-2
in
favor
of
that,
the
rule
of
de
minimis
or
something
similar
to
it.
four
different
circuits
had
held
that
in
a
single
overnight
transfer
or
a
very
short
term
transfer
that
did
not
interfere
with
the
purposes
of
the
act,
did
not
require
dismissal
with
prejudice,
there
were
two
courts
of
appeals
that
were
to
the
contrary,
and
congress
therefore
stepped
in
with
a
different
rule
and
amended
the
act
as
it
was
entitled
to
do
under
article...
under
section
7
of
the
implementing
legislation.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
the
fourth
circuit
has
addressed
that
issue
in
a
case
called
bush
v.
muncie,
and
it's
not
a
matter
of
any
clarity,
but
it
appears
that
it
would
be
somewhat
difficult
for
a
state
to
unilaterally
amend
its
implementing
legislation
without
withdrawing
unless
it,
as
congress
did
in
section
7,
had
expressly
reserved
that
right,
and
then
if
it
had,
if
it
did
enact
the
provision
that
was
inconsistent
with
the
agreement,
there
would
be
an
issue
among
the
states
as
to
whether
or
not
those
states
were
willing
to
give
that
amending
state
the
benefits
of
the
agreement,
notwithstanding
its
departure
in
some
degree.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
oh,
for
48
states
to
arrive
at
the
agreement,
to
pass
it
as
implementing
legislation
in
each
of
those
48
states
and
to
get
congress
to
pass
on
the
compact
is
a
somewhat
arduous,
although
it
is
potentially
viable
prospect.
however,
we
believe
that
just
as
congress
resolved,
in
effect,
a
4-2
circuit
conflict
in
favor
of
the
rule
of
de
minimis
and
in
favor
of
permitting
these
returns,
we
believe
that
this
court
could
take
cognizance
of
the
rule
of
de
minimis
as
well
and
rule
that
because
a
single
overnight
transfer
is
so
unlikely
to
interfere
with
the
purposes
of
the
act
that
it
falls
within
the
rule
of
de
minimis
and
therefore
should
not
result
in
harsh
consequence
of
complete
frustration
of
the
state's
efforts
to
enforce
its
criminal
laws.
that
result
would--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--best
case
from
this
court
on
de
minimis
or--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--the
case
we
cited
on
the
first
page
of
our
argument
section
is
wrigley,
but
wrigley
cites
about
six
other
people.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
next
best
case
would
probably
be
portland
v.
retail
druggists
association,
and
the
next
case
after
that
would
probably
be
anderson
v.
yungkau.
those
cases
all
involved
intentional
conduct
that
was
in
violation
of
a
specific
prohibition,
but
in
each
of
those
cases
this
court
contemplated
that
because
the
conduct
itself
was
of
de
minimis
proportion
in
relation
to
the
act's
purposes
and
the
realities
of
the
marketplace
in
one
case
and
the
realities
of
the
hospital
industry
in
another,
it
could
be
excused
under
the
rule
of
de
minimis.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
we
don't
believe
it's
a
fundamental
alteration
in
the
design
of
the
system,
it
is
simply
a
recognition
that
there
are
some
applications
that
are
so
far
removed
from
the
purpose
and
so
insubstantial
and
some,
in
fact,
that
are
so
insubstantial
in
light
of
the
purpose
that
they
fall
within
the
well
recognized
rule
of
de
minimis
and
therefore
should
not
be
considered
violations
of--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--this
is,
in
fact,
a
trap
for
the
unwary,
but
the
federal
government
does
not
have
a
way
of
knowing
whether
or
not
the
individual
was
being
brought,
for
example,
back
merely
to
plead
guilty,
in
which
case
it
would
take
overnight...
it
would
cost
a
new
trial.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
correct,
and
in
fact
if
he
were
pleading
guilty
and
that
were
the
arranged...
the
agreement
was
trial,
24
hours
would
have
sufficed
to
complete
the
trial
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
