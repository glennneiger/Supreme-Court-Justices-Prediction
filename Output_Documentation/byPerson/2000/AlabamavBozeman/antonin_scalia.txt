justice

scalia
well,
you
shouldn't
sign
agreements
that
say
this
then
if
you
don't
intend
to
abide
by
it.
it
just
couldn't
be
clearer.
it
just
says
if
trial
is
not
had,
the
information
or
complaint
shall
not
be
of
any
further
force
and
effect,
and
the
court
shall
enter
an
order
dismissing.
why
did
your
state
sign
that,
adopt
that
if
it
wasn't
prepared
to
abide
by
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
do
not
know
a
background
principle
that
overcomes
the
explicit
mandate
of
a
statute,
shall
enter
an
order
dismissing
the
same.
do
you
have
cases
that
simply
don't
talk
about
where
the
implied
effect
of
a
provision
in
most
cases
is
to
cause
dismissal
of
the
suit,
we
won't
let
it
happen
when
there's
been
no
substantial
prejudice,
that
i
can
understand,
but
here
you
have
language
that
is
categorically
mandatory.
justice

scalia
act
of
god
is
a
different
exception
than
de
minimis
and
a
different
exception
than
harmless
error?
justice
antonin
scalia
against
the
prosecutor
or
against
the
defendant?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
what
the
harm
consists
of
if
we
had
to
look
for
harmless
error,
what
would
we
look
for?
losing
a
job
as
a
barber?
