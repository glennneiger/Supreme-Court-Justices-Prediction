we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
00-492,
alabama
versus
bozeman.
ms.
stewart.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
there
was
an
effort
to
amend
this
provision,
if
it
proves
that
you're
wrong
about
the...
how
could
it
be
done?
could
congress
alone
do
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
congress
did
it,
didn't
it,
for
federal
prisoners?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
stewart.
mr.
lamken,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lamken.
mr.
christensen,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what's
the
authority
of
the
council
of
state
governments
as
to
interpreting
a
written
document?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
was
the
position
that
the
council
of
state
governments
took,
that
it
should
be
liberally
construed
to
accomplish
its
beneficent
ends
or
something
like
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
course
it
had
more
purposes
than
one,
did
it
not?
i
mean,
i
don't
think
you
would
find
a
whole
lot
of
states
signing
onto
it
if
it
did
nothing
but
benefit
prisoners.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
and
that's
true
of
prisoners,
too,
i
suppose,
responding
to
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical,
they
return
him
to
the
original
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
sauce
for
the
goose
is
sauce
for
the
gander?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you're
bringing
somebody
in
just
for
trial,
presumably
you're
going
to
get
counsel
appointed
if
he's
indigent
only
at
the
time
he's
brought
in
for
trial,
and
is
that
going
to
be
enough
time
for
counsel
to
prepare?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
were
these
federal
prisoners?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
they
could
get,
the
state
could
get,
the
government
could
get
the
advantage
of
the
federal
amendment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
christensen.
ms.
stewart,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
stewart.
the
case
is
submitted.
