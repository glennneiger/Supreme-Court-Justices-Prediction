justice
ruth
bader

there
was
an
enormous
difference,
ms.
stewart,
between
that
case
and
this
one,
and
that
is
the
defendant
did
something
that
caused...
the
defendant
was
sitting
right
there,
and
agreed
to
something.
here
the
defendant
hasn't
agreed
to
anything
at
all.
so
it's
one
thing
to
say
a
defendant
can't
say,
yeah,
go
ahead
and
try
me
and
then
the
trial
date
comes
and
he
says,
uh
huh,
it's
too
late.
here
the
defendant
didn't
do
one
thing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
seems
it
would
apply
then
in
every
case,
and
here
was
a
prosecutor
who
made
a
perfectly
reasonable
choice
were
it
not
for
this
iad
to
say,
we're
going
to
turn
him
around
in
24
hours,
just
want
to
arraign
him
and
send
him
back,
but
the
literal
reading
of
this
cuts
the
other
way,
and
if
you
don't
hold
prosecutors
to
that
literal
reading,
then
every
case
would
be
harmless,
and
must,
shall
would
have
no
teeth
at
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
saying
there
would
be--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
we're
talking
about
a
one
day
turnaround.
we're
talking
about...
i'm
saying
that
this
practice
of
saying
it's
convenient
for
us
to
bring
the
person
up
without
the
clock
ticking
on
when
we
have
to
start
the
trial,
so
bring
him
up,
arrange
arraignment,
send
him
right
back.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
every
case
like
that
would
be
harmless
error
and
not...
and
then
you
have
the
words
of
the
statute
and
then
simply
not
enforced.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
on
that,
even
in
this
case
illustrates
the
particular
day,
first
it
was
one
day,
then
another
day,
so
it
doesn't
seem
that
the
particular
day
is
what's
at
issue.
it's
the
idea
of
can
we
get
this
person
here
for
a
purpose
other
than
trial,
then
send
him
back,
and
not
keep
him
here
long
term
until
the
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
states
couldn't
replicate
that
because
they
all
have
to
be
bound
by
the
same,
is
that
so
or
don't
you
know
what
is
the
answer
to
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
lamken,
you're
really
asking
us
for
across
the
board
approval
of
we
could
bring
the
person
up
for
a
reason
other
than
trial,
legitimate
reason,
to
arraign
the
person,
to
be
interrogated
or
whatever,
a
special
purpose
unrelated
to
trial,
and
yet
the
statute
doesn't
make
any
room
for
this,
and
i
had...
ms.
stewart
was
speaking
and
she
said
the
prosecutor
made
a
mistake.
here
it
took
mistakes
on
both
ends,
the
sending
of
the
person.
is
there
no
effort
to
communicate
to
the
states
and
to
all
the
federal
authorities
that
this
compact
as
presently
drawn
says
when
you
send
them,
they
stay
until
the
trial
is
over?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
communication
was,
we
want
him
for
24
hours.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
christensen,
can
i
ask
you,
before
you
get
on
to
that,
why
one
couldn't
read
the
statute
as
has
been
proposed
by
the
appellant
to
say
the
don't
return
until
trial
is
over
kicks
in
only
when
the
transportation
is
for
purposes
of
trial,
that
is
the
act
simply
does
not
apply
to
bringing
somebody
in
for
pretrial
matters.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
how
could...
how
could
this
have
been
done?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
very
case,
here's
the
prosecutor
says
i
want
him
here
for
one
day.
to
avoid
this
trap
of
it,
is
there
a
procedure,
state
to
state
for
bringing
somebody
up
for
purpose
other
than
trial?
