isn't
there
a
broader
problem?
and
i
have
the
same
difficulty,
i
guess,
with
the
government's
de
minimis
argument,
and
that
is,
it's
true
there
is
a...
there
is
a,
as
you
put
it,
a
sort
of
background
principle
of
the
harmless
error
doctrine,
and
there's
a
background
de
minimis,
but
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
background
to
the
effect
that
these
either/or
of
these
doctrines
may
be
used
to
excuse
an
intentional
and
systematic
series
of
violations
of
the
statute,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
what
you
are
arguing
for.
you're
saying
not
only
would
we
move
the
person
for
two
days
for
an
arraignment
here,
we
will
continue
to
do
it
or
we
should
be
entitled
to
continue
to
do
it,
and
even
though
that's
a
technical
violation
of
the
statute,
we
would
in
each
case
be
excused
on
harmless
error.
do
you
know
of
any
instance
in
which
harmless
error
or
de
minimis,
for
that
matter,
has
been
used
in
effect
to
excuse
a
systematic
violation
of
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
thought
you
were
making
a
broader
argument,
and
that
is
that
this
sort
of
transfer
should
be
allowed.
it
is...
i
mean,
i
can
certainly
see
the
value
of
making
this
transfer
so
that
somebody
who
is
not
willing
to
waive
arraignment
can
at
least
get
counsel
appointed
and
get
the
ball
rolling
toward
prosecution,
and
i
thought
you
were
making
the
broader
argument,
not
merely
that
this
was
a
one
time
mistake,
but
that
for
the
good
reasons
that
support
this
procedure,
we
ought
as
a
general
matter
to
apply
harmless
error
whenever
it
occurs.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
wouldn't
the
same
argument
have
applied
to
the
united
states,
but
you
got
a
special
provision.
justice
david
h.
souter
wouldn't
the
easy
way
to
do
it,
though,
simply
be
to...
for
the
states
that
wanted
to
at
least
to
enter
into
a
new
pact
sort
of
in
the
nature
of
a
codicil,
and
put
that
before
congress
in
the
contract
clause...
the
compact
clause,
and
at
least
as
among
those
states
that
agreed
to
the
amendment,
i
would
suppose
there
would
be
no
impediment
to
applying
the
same
rule
that
the
united
states
has.
i
mean,
that
wouldn't
be
all
that
tough.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the
purpose
of
the
harmless
error
provision
in
the
compact
itself?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
do
you
get
that
from
the
text
of
the
harmless
error
provision
itself?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe
i'm
misunderstanding.
i'm
sorry,
i'm
reading
rule
52,
which
comes
at
the
end
of
the
appendix.
that
was
my
mistake.
justice
david
h.
souter
withdraw
the
question.
