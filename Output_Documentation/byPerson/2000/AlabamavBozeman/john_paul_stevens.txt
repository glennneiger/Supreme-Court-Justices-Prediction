justice

paul

but
if
your
rationale
is
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
prisoner,
why
isn't
the
waiver
the
solution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
we
can't
make
the
law
take
care
of
miscommunication
within
the
united
states
department
of
justice,
can
we?
we've
got
to
assume
everybody
knows
what's
going
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
to
the
extent
you
rely
on
the
interests
of
the
prisoner,
it
seems
to
me
that
interest
is
totally
protected
by
a
simple
requirement
that
he
can
waive
because
he
would
presumably
have
counsel
to
advise
him,
listen,
you're
better
off
if
you
go
back
and
continue
your
program.
i
just
don't
understand
why
the
waiver
isn't
a
complete
answer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
if
your
reference
to
the
arrival
of
the
prisoner
in
the
receiving
state
in
subparagraph
(c)
is
that
your
response
to
justice
kennedy's
hypothetical,
too,
about
the
hurricane
or
the
snowstorm
in
alabama.
but
you
have
to
arrive
before--
