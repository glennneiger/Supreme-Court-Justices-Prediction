justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
alabama
just
get
out
of
it
any
time
they
want?
how
does
that
work?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
state
could
through
this
legislature
just
withdraw
from
the
whole
country?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
said
the
prosecutor
dropped
the
ball,
i
think
candidly,
which
leads
to
justice
breyer's
question.
if
everything
had
gone
right
here,
he
would
have
stayed
in
the
county
jail
and
not,
and
would
not
be
returned
to
the
original
place
where
we
get
can
get
him
then
in
a
minute,
he
could
probably
be
returned
some
other
place.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
at
least
not
to
the
original
place
until
the
trial's
complete?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
unless
i
get
a
waiver?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
he
be
brought
to
another
state
for
questioning
just
to
meet
with
police
officials?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
is
it
just
a
court
proceeding?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that,
we
don't
really
need
to
resolve
that
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
on
that
point,
i
thought
that
was
a
persuasive
argument
that
both
you
and
the
government
make.
they
are
interested
in
the
rehabilitation,
so
they
should
send
him
back
to
the
federal
prison.
but
why
can't
that
be
achieved
by
just
asking
for
a
waiver
from
the
man
because
he
would
presumably
agree
with
you
in
the
normal
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
not?
i
mean,
if
everybody
is
fully
informed
about
the
statute
and
the
procedures,
why
couldn't
that
interest
be
adequately
protected
by
saying,
counsel,
here's
the
problem,
we
can't
try
this
fellow
for
another
30
days,
so
we'd
rather...
we
can
either
let
him
stay
here
in
the
county
jail
or
go
back
to
his
regular
rehabilitation
program
and
then
give
the
person
the
choice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that
just
means
that
instead
of
a
24-hour
turnaround,
make
it
48
hours,
so
you
appoint
counsel,
give
them
time
to
consult
with
counsel,
and
then
decide
whether
to
go
ahead
with
the
trial
before
you
send
him
back
or
send
him
back
and
let
him
continue
the
government
program.
i
would
think
very
often
the
prisoner
would
say,
yes,
it
makes
more
sense
to
go
back,
but
assuming
i
guess
he
lived
in
alabama,
didn't
he?
that's
part
of
the
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
clearly
required
if
you
read
it
literally,
but
you're
sort
of
saying
for
this
reason
we
should
not
read
it
literally
and
therefore
it's
not
required.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yeah.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
this
the
essential
rationale
for
the
act,
that
the
prisoner
have
these
correctional
programs
or
was
it
more
the
thought
that
a
state
should
be
entitled
to
impose
its
punishment
for
retribution
purposes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
the
act
have
been
complied
with
here
if
the
prisoner,
instead
of
being
returned
to
florida,
the
florida
prison,
had
gone
to
some
other
prison
because
it
says
he
has
to
be
returned
to
the
original
place
of
imprisonment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
there
been
any
cases
on
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
they
could
just
send
him
across
the
street
to
the
federal
prison
for
a
couple
months,
and
there
would
be
no
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
that's
not
where
he
originally
came
from.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
your
best
case
from
this
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
de
minimis
proposition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
didn't
think
that
was
it.
what's
your
next
best
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
justice
souter
pointed
out,
though,
this
is
a
remedial
system,
and
you're
asking
us
to
really
alter
the
design
of
the
system.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
happens
if
the
state
of
alabama
picks
up
the
prisoner
at
the
federal
facility
and
starts
a
three
hour
journey,
but
after
half
an
hour
there
is
a
big
snowstorm
and
it
has
to
go
back?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
a
tornado.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
god
doesn't
act
in
de
minimis
ways?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
if
they
return
him
to
another
facility,
they
take
him
away
from
the...
this
was
in...
in
florida,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--suppose
they
took
him
next
to
marion,
ohio.
that's
not
the
original
place
of
imprisonment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
live
by
the
sword
and
you
know
what
else
you
do,
if
you're
going
to
believe
in
strict
construction
here.
there's
a
kind
of
liberal
construction
in
favor
of
the
prisoner?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
where...
have
we
said
that
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
but
there
are
many
cases
in
which
the
federal
prison
is
right
across
the
street
from
the
state
prison.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
there
have
been
an
argument
here
that
there
was,
i
don't
know,
continuous
constructive
custody
by
the
federal
government?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
they
delivered
him
over
to
those--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
did
have
the
same
question
as
the
chief
justice.
it
seemed
to
me
that
earlier
the
prisoner
sees
his
new
state
counsel
and
begins
working
on
the
case
and
then
the
more
time
before
the
case
starts,
the
better
off
the
prisoner
is.
