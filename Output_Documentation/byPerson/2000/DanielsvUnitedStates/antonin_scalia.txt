i
assume
that
your
theory
would
apply
not
just
to
enhancement
questions
but
also
to
any
other
disabilities
attaching
to
the
prior
criminal
conviction.
specifically,
i
believe
that
california,
like
many
states,
disqualifies
convicted
felons
from
voting.
now,
could
your
client
have
presented
himself
at
the
registration
booth
for
voting
and,
when
told
that
he
could
not
vote
because
he
was
a
felon,
could
he
say,
oh,
but
that
conviction
was
invalid
and
i
want
an
opportunity
to
challenge
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
right
to
vote
is
worth
something,
too.
we
protect
that
with
many
due
process
and
other
restrictions
upon
what
the
state
can
do.
why
shouldn't
he
have
the
right
to...
you're
saying
you
cannot
use
the
conviction
for
anything
except
sending
him
to
jail
upon
the
first
conviction.
if
you
say
you
can't
use
it
to
increase
his
sentence
on
the
later
conviction,
i
don't
see
why
you
also
don't
have
to
say
you
can't
use
it
to
disable
him
from
voting.

mr.--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
dreeben,
i
don't
know
why
we
focus
upon
what
the
expectation
of
the
defendant
was
at
the
time
he
pleaded
guilty,
as
opposed
to
what
his
expectation
was
at
the
time
he
committed
the
later
crime.
do
you
think
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
a
state
to
say
that
anyone
who
has
a
prior
conviction
on
the
record,
all
right,
that
has
been
obtained
in
any
manner
so
long
as
gideon
has
been
complied
with,
anyone
who
has
that
on
his
record
who
commits
a
later
crime
gets
a
longer
sentence?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
knows
what
the
rules
are
when
he
commits
the
later
crime.
he
knows
he
pleaded
guilty
of
the
former
crime.
he
knows
that
anyone
who
has
pleaded
guilty
to
a
former
crime
will
get
a
longer
sentence.
isn't
that
the
expectation
that
we
should
be
concerned
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
a
statutory
question,
though,
and
not
a
constitutional
question,
whether
the
statute
was
of
the
sort
that
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
i
described
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
you
say
that
it
would
be
constitutional
if
it
were
of
that
sort,
then
isn't
it
a
fortiori
true
that
what
the
defendant
is
complaining
about
here
is
likewise
constitutional?
