with
certain
exceptions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
make
that
argument
even
if
it's
a
gideon
violation?
in
other
words,
say
that
it's
a
final
sentencing,
the
defendant
had
either
no
counsel
or
inadequate
counsel,
and
didn't
learn
that
there
was
a
gideon
violation
before
and
he'd
already
served
his
sentence
for
the
crime
where
there
was
the
gideon
violation,
could
he
raise
that
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
not
at
the
federal
sentencing.
say
he
gets
sentence,
and
then
by
mistake
the
sentencing
judge
relies
on
a
prior
state
conviction
which
was
invalid
because
there
was
a
gideon
violation,
but
nobody
called
that
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
be
true
even
if
the
sentence
had
not
been
served
where
there
was
a
gideon
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
would
always
have
to
have
been
served,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
couldn't
then
go
in
on
a
2255
and
call
that
to
the
court's
attention
and
get
relief,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
he
had...
even
if
it
was
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
you've
got
a
case
that
has
facts
that
are
very
favorable
to
the
government
generally,
but
some
of
these
cases
are
much
closer,
like
the
seventh
circuit
case
where
the
evidence
was
really
quite
disturbing
about
whether
the
person
actually
received
a
fair
proceeding,
but
you
would
apply
the
same
rule
regardless
of
how
strong
the
proof
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
regardless
of
how
serious
the
violation
is,
unless
it's
a
gideon
violation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
custis
really
was
a
holding
on
the
meaning
of
924(e)
on
the
sentencing
proceedings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
of
course,
one
reason
that's
permissible
is
that
normally
there's
a
second
chance
to
prove
what
really
happened.
that's
part
of
the
answer--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--given
in
that
very
case,
that
they...
there
is
this
other
open
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
it's
your
view,
i
take
it,
that
even
if
the
prior
conviction
were
set
aside
in
state
proceedings
or
federal
proceedings,
that
that
would
not
justify
a
reduction
in
the
federal
sentence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
agree,
but
apparently
justice
scalia
would
not,
is
my
point.
