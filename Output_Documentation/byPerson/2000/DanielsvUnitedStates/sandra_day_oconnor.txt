justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
ask
whether
the
record
shows
whether
the
petitioner
challenged
those
'78
and
'81
convictions
in
a
timely
manner
on
direct
appeal
at
the
state
and/or
federal
level?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
know,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
opportunity
to
make
those
challenges
very
likely
occurred
when
the
convictions
became
final.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
are
there
statutes
of
limitations
for
habeas
actions
as
well?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
being
the
case,
this
is
an
end
run
around
those,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
think
that's
the
only
such
exception?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
about
a
so
called
brady
violation,
where
the
facts
aren't
known
until
maybe
immediately
before
the
sentencing
proceeding
in
the
new
crime?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
about
a
dna
claim
in
a
death
case
coming
up
later?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
first
case
is
daniels
versus
the
united
states
which
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
petitioner
earthy
daniels
was
convicted
in
federal
court
of
being
a
felon
in
possession
of
a
firearm.
because
he
had
four
prior
state
convictions
for
violent
felonies,
his
federal
sentence
was
enhanced
under
the
armed
career
criminal
act
of
1984.
after
an
unsuccessful
direct
appeal,
he
filed
a
motion
under
28
u.s.c.
section
2255
seeking
to
vacate,
set
aside
or
correct
his
federal
sentence.
he
argued
that
the
enhanced
sentence
violated
the
constitution
because
it
was
based
in
part
on
two
prior
state
convictions,
which
were
themselves
unconstitutional.
both
prior
convictions
he
claimed
were
based
on
inadequate
guilty
pleas
and
he
said
one
was
the
product
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
the
district
court
denied
the
section
2255
motion
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
affirm
that
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
in
custis
versus
united
states,
we
held
that
with
the
sole
exception
of
convictions
obtained
in
violation
of
the
right
to
counsel,
a
defendant
has
no
right
under
the
armed
career
criminal
act
or
at
the
constitution
to
collaterally
attack
prior
convictions
at
his
federal
sentencing
proceeding.
the
consideration
supporting
that
conclusion
ease
of
administration
and
the
interest
in
promoting
the
finality
of
judgments
are
equally
present
and
forceful
in
the
context
of
a
petition
under
section
2255.
a
defendant
convicted
in
state
court
may
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
his
conviction
on
direct
appeal,
in
state
postconviction
proceedings
and
in
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
under
section
28
2254.
after
an
enhanced
federal
sentence
has
been
imposed
pursuant
to
the
armed
career
criminal
act,
the
defendant
may
pursue
any
channels
of
direct
or
collateral
review
still
available
to
challenge
prior
conviction
used
to
enhance
the
federal
sentence.
if
however
the
prior
conviction
is
no
longer
open
to
direct
or
collateral
review
because
the
defendant
failed
to
pursue
those
remedies
while
they
were
available
or
because
he
did
so
unsuccessfully
then
the
defendant
is
without
further
recourse.
the
presumption
of
validity
that
attached
to
the
prior
conviction
at
the
time
of
federal
sentencing
is
conclusive,
and
the
defendant
may
not
collaterally
attack
his
prior
conviction
through
a
ยง2255
motion
directed
at
the
enhanced
sentence.
so,
as
in
the
previous
custis
case,
we
recognized
an
exception
to
the
rule
where
the
prior
conviction
was
obtained
for
failure
to
appoint
counsel
at
all,
but
we
think
a
contrary
rule
what
effectively
permit
challenges
too
stale
to
be
brought
in
their
own
right
and
would
sanction
an
end
run
around
statutes
of
limitations
and
other
procedural
barriers
that
would
preclude
the
movant
from
attacking
the
prior
conviction
directly.
because
the
petitioner
here
failed
to
pursue
remedies
that
were
otherwise
available
with
respect
to
his
prior
state
convictions,
his
section
2255
motion
was
properly
denied.
justice
scalia
has
joined
all
but
part
2c
of
the
opinion
and
has
filed
on
opinion
concurring
in
part;
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens
and
ginsburg
have
joined;
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
