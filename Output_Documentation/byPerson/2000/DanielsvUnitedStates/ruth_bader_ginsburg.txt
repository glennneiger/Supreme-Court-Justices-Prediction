mr.
tanaka,
even
if
you're
right
that
there's
no
bar
from
challenging
the
federal,
the
abuse
in
the
federal
proceeding,
shouldn't
the
federal
court
at
least
take
into
account,
in
determining
whether
2255
really
is
warranted,
that
these
matters
could
have
been
raised
earlier
in
the
state
proceedings
on
direct
appeal
or
on
collateral
attack?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
shouldn't
the
federal
interest
include
did
this
person
have
a
reason
for
not
bringing
this
up
earlier?
i
mean,
one
can
imagine
cases
where
you
might
try
to
knock
out
for
federal
sentencing
purposes
an
earlier
state
conviction
and
say,
there
was
a
procedural
impediment,
or
there
was
a
reason
i
didn't
know
about
this
until
much
later,
like
brady
material
that
wasn't
turned
over?
shouldn't
there
be
at
least
that
requirement,
that
for
the
2255
purpose
you
would
have
to
show
a
good
reason
for
not
raising
it
earlier
in
the
state
courts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're...
but
i
wanted
just
to
be
clear
on
one
thing.
you're
not
saying
in
this
case
that
there
was
any
special
reason
why
these
matters
could
not
have
been
raised
earlier?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
tanaka,
in
your
last
series
of
answers
you
seem
to
be
departing
from
what
i
thought
was
the
clear
line
you
took
in
your
brief.
that
is,
for
all
state
purposes
you
are
accepting
that
this
sentence
is
good,
and
you
are
distinguishing
the
federal
enhancement
from
any
other...
from
any
state
law
consequence,
but
now
in
your
answer
to
the
questions
that
justice
souter
and
justice
scalia
just
asked
you
seem
to
be
saying
it's
not
just
the
federal
enhancement
purpose
that
you're
questioning
where
this
can
be
brought
up
but
also
in
the
state
proceeding
as
well.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
kept
saying
in
your
brief
that
you're
not
touching
the
state
consequences
of
this,
that
those
are
a
given,
and
you
accept
those,
but
your
answers
here
depart
from
that
view,
so
which
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
that
the
2255
forum
is
accustomed
to
dealing
with
questions
of
this
nature,
and
you
distinguished
that
from
the
sentencing
forum
in
custis,
but
it
seems
to
me
it's
the
same
forum.
it's
the
same
district
judge,
just
a
different
proceeding
but
in
the
same
court,
so
i
did
not
follow
what
you
were
getting
at
when
you
were
saying
that
the
2255
forum
is
accustomed
to
dealing
with
these
kinds
of
questions
but
the
sentencing
judge
is
not,
when
it's
one
and
the
same
judge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
true
in
custis
itself,
wasn't
it?
he
could
have
gone
back
to
the
state
court?
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
said
he
could
have
gone
to
maryland
or
on
2254
review--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--of
the
maryland
conviction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're...
but
you
are
leaving
open
the
possibility,
say
somebody
in
this
position,
there's
a
quorum
nobis
proceeding
in
the
state,
gets
it
knocked
out
under
state
law,
you're
saying
that
that's
the
situation
the
government
is
rethinking
whether
then,
if
you
succeed,
even
way
out
of
time,
to
get
it
knocked
out
at
the
state
court,
could
you
then
come
back
to
federal
court
on
a
2255
and
say,
now
the
state
has
knocked
this
out?
