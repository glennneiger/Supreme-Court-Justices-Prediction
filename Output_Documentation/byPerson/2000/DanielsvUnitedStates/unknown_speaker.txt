unknown
speaker
well,
why
shouldn't
there
be
a
measure
of
finality
here?
i
mean,
you
know,
you
can
go
back
and
argue
was
it
constitutional,
was
it
accurate,
but
also
there's
an
interest
in
getting
things
done
within
a
certain
time
frame.
unknown
speaker
you
said
a
few
times
that
the...
this
is
just
a
federal
matter,
it's
final
as
far
as
the
law
of
the
state
is
concerned.
does
the
state
of
california
have
an
interest
in
the
integrity
that's
accorded
to
its
judgments
in
this
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
it
would
have
a
very
strong
interest.
it
has
its
own
three-strikes
rule,
as
i
understand,
and
is
this
man
a
resident
of
the
state
of
california?
i
assume
he
is.
it
seems
to
me
it
has
a
very
strong
interest
in
having
its
judgments
of
criminal
convictions
respected.
unknown
speaker
and
to
say
that,
oh,
this
is
just
a
federal
matter,
it's
final
so
far
as
the
law
of
the
state
is
concerned,
i'm
not
sure
is
a
complete
answer.
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
that
there's
a
thought,
you
win
on
your
ability
to
challenge,
and
it's
thought
there's
necessary
to
be
a
evidentiary
hearing.
what
incentive
does
the
state
have
at
that
point
to
come
in
and
try
to
show
that
the
conviction
was
properly
obtained?
unknown
speaker
then
it's
a
very
strange
proceeding.
you're
challenging
the
judgment
of
a
state,
and
yet
the
state
isn't
a
party?
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
prevail
and
you
go
ahead
and
have
the
judgment
declared
invalid,
i...
what
would
happen
if
the
state
in
a
subsequent
proceeding
tried
to
use
those
convictions
for
its
own
three-strikes
rule?
unknown
speaker
if
you
did
not
concede
that,
then
i
will
withdraw
my
question.
unknown
speaker
but
we're
trying
to
understand
why
that
should
be.
i...
my
understanding
of
your
submission
is
that
there
is
a
federal
constitutional
right
under
the
due
process
clause
not
to
have
this
conviction
used
in
federal
court.
why
is...
why
don't
you
make
the
same
argument
if
it's
a
state
three
strike
conviction
case?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
federal
due
process
right
not
to
have
what
you
call
an
unreliable
or
a
false
conviction
used...
again,
it's
the
same
analysis,
same
constitution.
what's
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
one
question?
are
you
really
making
a
constitutional
argument,
or
are
you
arguing
for
a
construction
of
section
2255,
or
is
it
both?
unknown
speaker
but
does
your
position
have
to
rest
on
the
premise
that
the
sentence
would
be
unconstitutional
if
the
state
conviction
were...
that
the
federal
sentence
would
be
unconstitutional
if
the
state
sentence
were
invalid?
unknown
speaker
you
see,
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
theoretically
possible
to
say,
for
a
legislature
to
say,
we
wanted
to
enhance
a
sentence
if
there's
a
state
conviction
out
there,
and
we
don't
care
whether
it's
obtained
fairly
or
not.
the
fellow
was
at
least
indicted
and
he
went
to
jail
for
a
while,
and
that's
enough
for
us.
is
it
your
view
that
they
could
not
do
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
tanaka,
i
have
a
question
concerning
a
point
you
made
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
the
last
sentence
of
the
opinion
says,
may
attack
his
state
sentence
in
maryland
or
through
a
federal
habeas
review.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
four,
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
did--
unknown
speaker
--didn't
we
confine
it
to
2254?
unknown
speaker
maleng,
though,
was
directed
just
to
whether
or
not
he
was
in
custody.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
question
your
last
conclusion?
supposing
he
had
not...
he
was
still
in
state
custody
on
parole
or
something
of
that
kind,
would
not
then
the
federal
2255
have
an
impact
on
the
state's
interest
in
finality?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
hard
to
imagine
the
federal
judge
would
conclude
the
state's
conviction
was
invalid,
and
therefore
nothing
would
happen
in
the
state
proceedings
after
that.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
in
this
case,
mr.
tanaka,
it's
a
guilty
plea,
so
you
don't
have
any
real
question
of
whether
there's
a
record
to
show
that
he
did
it
or
didn't
do
it,
because
you
don't
get
that
sort
of
a
record
with
a
guilty
plea.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
very
difficult,
as
pointed
out
in
the
briefs,
when
you're
dealing
with
convictions
that
are
16
and
19
years
old,
to
go
back
and
show
exactly
what
happened
at
a
guilty
plea.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
as
mr.
dreeben
pointed
out,
your
client
can
simply
file
an
affidavit
saying
that,
you
know,
i
wasn't
fully
advised
of
what
was
going
on,
and
then
it's
up
to
the
government
to
come
back.
unknown
speaker
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
oâ€™connor.
