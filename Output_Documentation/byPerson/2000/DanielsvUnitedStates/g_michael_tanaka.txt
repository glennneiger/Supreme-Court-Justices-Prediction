mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
daniels
was
convicted
of
being
an
ex-felon
in
possession
of
a
firearm.
normally,
that
charge
carries
a
maximum
term
of
10
years.
where,
however,
the
person
has
suffered
three
qualifying
felonies,
that
term,
maximum
term
goes
up
to
life,
and
there's
a
mandatory
minimum
term
of
15
years,
which
mr.
daniels
was
sentenced
to.
where
those
convictions
are
both
unconstitutional
and
unreliable,
the
resulting
sentence
is
likewise
unconstitutional,
and
the
issue
before
this
case
is
whether
section
2255
provides
a
forum
and
remedy
to
address
that
unconstitutionality
of
the
sentence.
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
i
don't
believe
that's
in
the
record.
there
is
no
indication
that
he
has
challenged
those
at
the
state
level.
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
i'm
sure
that
there
was,
in
california,
a
procedure
for
direct
appeal
and,
lacking
that,
also
collateral
review
of
those
convictions,
but
that's
not
what's
at
issue
today.
at
issue
today
is
its
use
in
the
federal
sentencing
procedure,
so--
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
--i
agree,
your
honor,
and
there...
but
there
is
finality
with
respect
to
those
state
convictions.
the
state
of
california,
he
served
those
convictions,
he
served
the
prior
terms,
he
served
his
imprisonment.
those
convictions
are
final
as
to
the
california
judgment.
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
certainly
there
are.
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
o'connor.
the
statute
of
limitation
goes
to
the
underlying
conviction,
and
certainly
he
had
his
chance
to
challenge
those,
and
that
time
has
long
since
passed,
and
we're
not
challenging
that
judgment,
that
conviction,
but
when
that
conviction
is
used,
again,
to
increase
his
federal
sentence,
then
necessarily
the
federal
court
must
look
at
its
reliability,
otherwise
it's
a
violation
of
due
process.
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
again,
the
federal
interest
is
totally
different
than
the
state
interest.
the
state
has
no--
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
--i
agree
that
that
would
explain,
and
there
certainly
would
be
cases
where
that
would
explain
why
it
wasn't
raised,
and
that
perhaps
presents
a
more
compelling
case,
but
i
don't
think
it's
a
prerequisite,
and
the
reason
for
that
is--
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
--that's
correct,
i'm
not
making
any
claim
that
he
was
prevented
by
something
external
to
himself
that
prevented
him
from
raising
this
in
state
court,
but
i
don't
think
the
argument
depends
on
that.
again--
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
--the
state
of
california
has
an
interest
in
the
integrity
of
its
judgments.
where...
and
i
guess
the
state
of
california
has
some
perhaps
minimal
interest
in
whether
its
judgment
is
used
conclusively
as
a
federal
sentencing
predicate.
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
well,
we--
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
--well,
it
is
respected
in
the
sense
that
it
has
a
presumptive
validity,
and
certainly
this
court's
case
in
custis
established
that
fact,
and
no
one's
suggesting
that
we
go
behind
that
validity
once
it's
presented,
but
there's...
i
don't
know
that
it
has
an
interest
in
a
conclusive-type
validity,
especially
where
it's
being
used
as
a
federal
sentencing
predicate.
now--
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
--i
don't
know
that
the
state
would
necessarily
be
a
party.
i
don't
believe
they
have
very
much
incentive--
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
--but
it's
the
federal
government
that's
seeking
to
use
that
judgment
as
a
federal
sentencing
predicate
to
increase
the
federal
sentence
in
federal
court.
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
i
would
assume
that
the
state
could
validly
use
those
convictions
in
its
own
three-strike
rule,
because
the
federal
sentence,
the
federal
procedure
would
just
invalidate
the
state
conviction,
or
the
use
of
the
state
conviction,
not
the
state
conviction
itself,
as
a
means
to
lengthen
the
federal
sentence.
the--
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
--certainly
that's
part
of
it,
but
the...
now
the--
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
--yes,
i
agree--
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
--well,
the
other
part
would
be
that
the
state
would
obviously
not
be
bound
by
anything
that
happened
in
the
federal
proceeding.
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
that
could
well
be.
there
could
well
be
due
process
problems
associated
with
its
subsequent
use
in
the
state,
but
it
might
be
that
those
problems
are--
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
--that
would
be
the
problem.
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
but
it
might
be
that
the
problem
doesn't
rise
to
a
large
enough
level
that
the
state
necessarily
violates
due
process
by
refusing
to
litigate
that
anew.
in
other
words--
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
--i
agree
with
that.
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
the...
there
is
a...
there
is
no
problem
with
notice,
and...
but
that
again
suggests
the
concept
of
waiver,
or
maybe
even
sandbagging.
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
i'm
sorry,
perhaps
i
didn't
understand
the
predicate
of
your
question
when
i
first
answered.
i
believe
i
answered
that
there
is
a
due
process
problem
with
using
the
unreliable
conviction
whether
you're
using
it
to
enhance
a
state
sentence
or
a
federal
sentence.
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
okay.
it
could
be
applied
at
the
state
level
to
the
initial
state
conviction.
okay,
again,
if,
analogous
to
this
case,
that
conviction
was
used
in
a
state
proceeding
to
enhance
a
subsequent
state
sentence,
then
there
might...
there
would
be
a
due
process
right
to
examine
that
conviction
anew--
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
--with
respect
to
the
enhancement
provision--
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
--there
well
could
be,
if
there's
some
unreliability
of
the
conviction.
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
no.
there...
as
long
as
there's
a
procedure,
a
substantive
due
process
procedure
for
litigating
that,
it
could
be
that,
consistent
with
due
process,
there
could
be
some
limitations
and
in
that
case
that
might
well
be
one
of
them.
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
i
think
it
well
could
be.
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
the
difference
is
this.
in
this
case...
due
process
is
obviously
a
flexible
concept,
and
what's
at
stake
here
is
1)
an
automatic
increase
in
the
sentence
and
2)
a
dramatic
increase
in
the
sentence.
the
sentence
went
from
presumptively
7
years
to
more
than
double,
to
a
min...
to
a
minimum
of
15
years.
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
oh,
i
think
there's
certainly
a
greater
liberty
interest
with
respect
to
imprisonment,
but--
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
--no,
i
don't
believe
so.
obviously
the
only
fact
at
issue
here
is
the...
is
its
use
in
the
federal
proceeding,
and--
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
--i'll
stick
with
what
i
said
in
the
brief.
we're
not
challenging
any
state
use
of
this
conviction.
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
one
might--
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
--and
one
might,
if
one
were
arguing
that
case,
argue
that,
and
i
think
there...
but
there
are
certainly
different
considerations
there,
because
if
the
federal
court
is
reviewing
the
state
court's
use
of
its
own
recidivist
provisions,
then
there
are
more
comity
and
finality
questions
that
aren't
at
issue
here.
that's
what
distinguishes
this
case,
is
that
all
we're
doing
in
this
case
is
looking
at
the
federal
court
examining
a
federal
sentence
under
2255,
which
explicitly
provides
for
that
review.
there's
no
intrusion
in
the
state
court
judgment,
and
that's
the
position
i
took
in
the
brief
and
that's
the
position
i
take
here,
that
the
state
judgment,
we're
leaving
that
alone.
nothing
that
the
federal
district
court's
going
to
do
in
granting
that
2255
motion
and
finding
this
conviction
too
unreliable
to
automatically
sentence
this
man
to
an
additional
8
years
in
prison
is
going
to
affect
that
state
court
judgment.
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
well,
you
use
your--
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
--well,
if
you
don't
accept
that
constitutional
point
that
the
use
of
an
unreliable
prior
conviction
that
doesn't
implicate
the
person...
doesn't
implicate
the
person's
guilt
can
be
automatically
used
to
dramatically
increase
the
sentence
conclusively,
then
we're
both
stuck,
unless
you
can
use
your
powers
of
persuasion
to
change
the
court's
decision,
but--
[laughter]
that's
certainly
the
genesis
of
this
argument.
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
it's
both.
certainly
the
case
depends
on
a
construction
of
2255
to
remedy
what
is
an
obvious
constitutional
violation.
by
its
plain
language,
2255
allows
someone
sentenced
in
federal
court
to
challenge
that
sentence
as
being
unconstitutional,
and
it
gives
the
sentencing
court
the
power
to
correct
that
sentence
as,
in
fact,
a
constitutional--
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
--not
just
invalid--
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
--yes.
where
it
can
be
shown
that
that
conviction
doesn't
reliably
indicate
the
man's
guilt
i
believe...
well,
it's
my
position
that
that
violates
the
constitution
and
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
well,
the
point
was
that
normally
a
sentencing
procedure
is
rather
quick
and
summary,
whereas
a
proceeding
on
a
2255
case,
there
might
be
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
the
scheduling
and
so
forth
would
be
different,
and
also
there
are
rules
that
govern
2255
cases
that
don't
govern
sentencing,
and
so
it's
more
appropriately
placed
there.
but
the
major
point
is
that
2255
expressly
provides
for
this
type
of
procedure,
whereas
you
know,
obviously
there's
nothing
in
the
sentencing
statute
that
likely,
likewise
provides
for
it.
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
believe
that
the
due
process
analysis
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
you
can
only
challenge
convictions
that
don't
reliably
indicate
guilt.
there's
not
an
identity
between
a
due
process
violation
and
a
constitutional
violation.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
i'd
first
like
to
address
the
question
of
what
custis
left
open.
we've
been
talking
about
the
sentence
at
issue,
and
it
ends,
if...
we
recognize...
and
this
is
at
page
497
of
the
custis
decision.
we
recognize,
however,
that
custis,
who
is
still
in
custody
for
purposes
of
state
convictions,
at
the
time
of
this
federal
sentencing
under
924(e)
may
attack
a
state
sentence
in
maryland
or
through
a
federal
habeas
review,
and
then,
importantly,
after
that
the
citation
is
just
see
maleng
v.
cook.
now,
there
are
two
things
that
suggest
that
what
that
left
open
was
the
possibility
of
reviewing
the
prior
conviction
as
it
enhanced
the
later
sentence.
first
is
that
it
says,
or
through
a
federal
habeas
review,
and
second
it
says,
it
cites
maleng
v.
cook.
now,
what
maleng
decided
was
that
there
was
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
a
federal
habeas
case
where
there
was
an
expired
conviction,
and
the
petitioner
in
that
case
had
attacked
an
expired
conviction
directly
and
what
this
court
said
was,
no,
you
couldn't
attack
that
directly,
but
there
was
subject
matter
jurisdiction
on
habeas
where
that
prior
conviction
was
used
to
enhance
a
subsequent
sentence.
so
that
strongly
suggests
that
the
remedy
that
this
court
left
open
in
custis
is
akin
to
what
exactly
is
at
issue
here
and
that
is,
a
2255
remedy,
by
its
very
terms,
allows
the
petitioner
to
attack
the
constitutionality
of
that
prior
state
conviction,
as
it
was
used
to
enhance
his
federal
sentence.
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
right,
whether
he
was
in
custody
on
the
subsequent
sentence,
but
it
suggests
that
they
would
entertain
attack
on
the
prior
conviction
through
the
custody
of
the
subsequent
sentence
and
conviction.
the
other
point
i
wanted
to
make
is,
the
solicitor
general
mentioned
that
there
was
a
fairness
finality
balance
here,
and
that
this
changes
where
the
conviction,
as
in
this
case,
is
so
old,
but
that
fails
to
recognize
that
the
finality
interests
where
the
conviction
is
used
in
a
subsequent
proceeding
are
not
the
same.
in
fact,
they're
not
even
close
to
the
same,
where
we're
challenging
the
challenges
to
that
state
conviction
directly,
and
that
is
because
this
court's
jurisprudence
in
many
of
those
2254
cases
regarding
finality
posits
the
rationale
that
the
state
judgment
is
a
final
one,
and
we
don't
want
to
intrude
in
the
state
process.
that
is,
we
don't
want
to
release
this
person
from
custody.
we
don't
want
to
make
the
state
retry
this
man.
we
don't
want
to
intrude
in
the
state
process.
in
this
case,
again,
that
interest
is
almost
nonexistent.
if
a
federal
sentencing
court
granted
a
2255,
there
is
no
impact
on
that
state
court
judgment.
so
it
really
boils
down
to
a
question
of,
is
there
a
remedy
for
someone
who
is
going
to
face
a
potential
life
term--
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
--i'm
not
sure
it
would--
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
--well,
certainly
the
federal
court
would
have
no
conclusive
effect
on
any
subsequent
state
court
proceeding,
and
whatever
persuasive
value
i
imagine
that
the
state
court
could
take
it
for
what
it
was
worth,
but
i
don't
know
that
it
would
necessarily
intrude
on
the
state
court
proceeding.
so
basically
what's
at
issue,
then,
is
do
we
allow
2255,
which
by
its
fine
language
provides
a
remedy
where
the
sentence
is
unconstitutional,
do
we
close
that
door
on
the
basis
of
considerations
that
aren't
at
issue
in
this
case,
or
do
we
allow
someone
who's
facing
a
life
sentence
to
litigate
the
validity,
and
in
some
cases
it's
going
to
be
obvious,
of
prior
convictions
that
don't
reliably
indicate
his
guilt
and,
as
the
solicitor
general
said,
the
whole
purpose
between
the
armed
career
criminal
act
is
incapacitation,
or--
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
so
the
issue
then
would
be,
does
this
record
reliably
reflect
his
guilt,
reviewing
the
record
that's
presented
on
the
guilty
plea,
and
that
would
be
an
issue
for
the
federal
district
court
to
decide
on
remand.
if
it
decided
that
indeed
there's
enough
evidence
here
that
we
have
no
question
that
he
was
guilty
and
there's
a
reliable
indication
of
that,
then
i
suppose
he's
out
of
court,
but
the
point
is,
he
needs
to
have
that
opportunity.
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
i'll
grant
that,
but
again
i
think
that
that
concern
is
addressed
by
placing
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
petitioner,
which...
where
it
lies,
and
if
the
sentencing
court
doesn't
find
that
persuasive,
then--
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
--and
to
the
extent
that's
possible
i'm
sure
the
government
will
do
that.
mr.
g.
michael
tanaka
well,
the
fact
is
there
just
aren't
that
many
of
these
cases,
but
that's
a
price
that
we
need
to
pay
in
order
to
make
sure
that
people
aren't
unjustly--
