we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
99-9136,
earthy
daniels
v.
united
states.
mr.
tanaka.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
tanaka,
you
say
that
what
you
want
to
challenge
is
state
court
convictions
that,
judgments
that
do
not
reliably
indicate
guilt.
well,
i
take
it
you
would
allow
a
challenge
on
the
basis
that
a
miranda
warning
wasn't
given,
and
that
there
was
some...
it
was
not
harmless
error,
and
yet
a
miranda
warning
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
guilt.
i
mean,
there
are
certainly
different
constitutional
claims
which
can
be
vindicated
in
the
proper
forum
but
don't
really
bear
on
guilt
or
innocence,
so
are
you
limiting
your
challenges
to
those
which
clearly
affect
guilt,
or
to
any
constitutional
claim
that
would
be
sustained
if
timely
brought?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
tanaka.
mr.
dreeben,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
tanaka,
you
have
7
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
very
difficult
for
someone
who
is
facing
that
kind
of
an
affidavit
to
simply
say,
well,
disbelieve
this
guy.
you
want
to
collect
information
showing
that
he
should
be
disbelieved.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
with
great
administrative
burden.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
there
comes
a
point
when
the
government
should
be
entitled
to
say,
this
is
the
way
the
cookie
crumbles.
you
bought
into
this,
and
you're
stuck
with
it.
thank
you.
that's
not
a
question.
well,
the
case
is
submitted.
