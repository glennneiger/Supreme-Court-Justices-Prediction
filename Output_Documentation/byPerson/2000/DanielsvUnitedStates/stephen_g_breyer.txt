justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
trying
to
have...
my
problem
is...
i
agree
with
you
basically.
you
realize
that
these
things
should
be
challengeable
in
a
sentencing
proceeding.
i
wrote
an
opinion
to
that
effect
in
palleo,
and
it
was
reversed
by
this
court,
so
now
what
do
i
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
my
problem
is,
quite
honestly,
that
i
don't
see
any
way,
if
you're
not...
i
think
these
things...
i
think
a
prior
should
be
challengeable
in
the
sentencing
hearing,
all
right?
that's
clear,
simple,
done
all
the
time,
no
problem,
fair.
all
right.
no,
but
there's
an
opinion
that
says
no.
now,
given
that
opinion,
i
think
i'm
stuck,
unless
i
were
to
accept
this
argument
that
the...
i
see
you
make
an
argument
about
the
constitutionality,
which
i
think
is
interesting,
but
i'm
not
sure
about
that
one.
is
there
anything
else?
if
i
don't
accept
that
constitutional
point,
if
i
would
have
been
with
the
dissenters
in
custis...
but
i
believe
in
stare
decisis.
i'm
stuck,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
i
thought
what
we're
concerned
about
are
people
who
in
1972...
something
that
appeared
fairly
minor
to
the
individual
who
is
convicted,
he's
told
by
somebody,
go
in
and
plead
guilty,
it's
not
going
to
be
a
big
deal.
he
has
no
idea
what
he's
doing.
he
doesn't
get
correct
advice,
and
he
goes
in
and
he
pleads
guilty,
and
he
was
totally
confused
at
the
state
proceeding.
now,
that
person
is
going
to
be
in
jail
for
life
because
of
a
later
crime,
although
if
you
look
at
what
happened
it
would
be
obviously
unconstitutional,
his
earlier
conviction.
now,
that's
the
case
we're
worried
about,
and
we
get
rid
of
the
other
cases
through
strict
burden
of
proof
rules,
so
all
we
have
in
front
of
us
are
those
cases,
and
the
question
is,
why
shouldn't
a
person
like
that
be
able
to
demonstrate
the
obvious
fact
that
that
earlier
conviction
was
obviously
unconstitutional,
and
you
give
me
the
answer
that
custis
says
no,
but
then
we
could
just
reply,
well,
that
was
because
of
the
language
of
the
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
here,
although
we're
running
around
robin's
barn
or
something
in
some
weird
procedural
way,
better
let
him
do
it
later
than
not
at
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
at
the
sentencing
proceeding.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
could
say,
i
guess...
and
i
don't
know
how
much
of
a
stretch
this
would
be.
you
could
say,
but
this
person
who
is
obviously
convicted
unconstitutionally,
and
i'll
underscore
obviously,
because
i
can
get
rid
of
the
nonobvious
cases
through
strict
burdens
of
proof,
all
right,
so
he
was
obviously
convicted
unconstitutionally,
that
that
person
should
have
some
forum
somewhere
in
which
to
point
that
out
before
he's
in
prison
for
life.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
vast
majority,
fine,
but
we
also
have
a
few
cases
where
it
was
like
somebody
had
robbed
a
chicken
coop,
you
know,
when
he
was
18
years
old,
and
now
12
years
later
this
chicken
coop
has
come
back
to
put
him
in
prison
for
life,
so
there
are
also
at
least
a
few
cases
where
you
think
maybe
he
didn't
get
very
good
advice
the
first
time.
