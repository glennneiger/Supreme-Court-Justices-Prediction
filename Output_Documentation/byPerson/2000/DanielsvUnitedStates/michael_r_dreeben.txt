mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
custis
v.
united
states
this
court
made
clear
that
at
a
federal
sentencing
proceeding
a
defendant
who
faces
recidivist
sentencing
may
not
bring
a
constitutional
challenge
to
the
validity
of
the
underlying
enhancement
conviction.
we
submit
that
the
same
principle
applies
where
it--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--with
the
exception
of
a
conviction
that
was
entered
in
violation
of
gideon
v.
wainwright,
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
that
is
the
line
that
the
court
drew
in
custis,
justice
o'connor.
it
rested
that
on
a
variety
of
considerations.
the
first
was
that
the
court's
jurisprudence
had
recognized
gideon
violations
as
a
unique
constitutional
defect
that
rose
even
to
the
level
of
a
jurisdictional
defect.
the
second
two
reasons
i
think
are
the
ones
that
most
clearly
explain
the
rule
that
we're
espousing
here.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
there
are
two
distinctions
between
that
kind
of
a
situation
and
the
gideon
situation.
the
one
that
i
think
is
most
applicable
to
the
majority
of
cases
that
are
going
to
come
up
in
this
context
is
that
a
brady
violation
is
a
very
fact
intensive
inquiry.
it
can't
be
resolved,
as
the
court
noted
in
custis
with
respect
to
a
gideon
claim,
simply
by
looking
at
the
judgment
or
the
judgment
role
and
determining
whether
the
defendant
had
counsel.
it
requires
instead
a
fairly
intricate
analysis
of
whether
the
government
suppressed
and
withheld
information
that
the
defendant
couldn't
with
due
diligence
have
gained
access
to,
and
whether
there
was
resulting
prejudice
to
the
defendant
as
a
consequence,
and
the
administrative
costs
of
adjudicating
that
are
far
more
substantial
and
very
intrusive
into
the
sentencing
process
as
compared
to
gideon.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
second...
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
that
is
the
second
distinction
in
your
hypothetical,
that
the
hypothetical
posits
that
this
was
information
about
a
constitutional
claim
that
could
not
with
due
diligence
have
been
obtained,
i'm
assuming
within
any
time
for
bringing
an
appropriate
appeal
or
collateral
challenge.
the
capital
context
is
unique
in
that
area,
i
think,
and
i'm
going
to
set
it
aside,
because
questions
of
actual
innocence
in
the
capital
context
would
be
dealt
with
under
the
eighth
amendment
and
would
implicate
constitutional
principles
that
aren't
broadly
applicable.
but
as
to
the
generality
of
sentencing
cases,
i
think
that
the
basic
rule
is
that
there
is
a
system
in
place
to
challenge
convictions
that
balances
two
fundamental
interests.
one
is
in
finality,
the
other
is
in
fundamental
fairness.
those
two
interests
have
always
been
accommodated
not
by
giving
one
total
sway
over
the
other,
but
by
saying
that
in
certain
contexts
there
are
claims
that
are
available
and
they
may
be
brought,
and
if
they
are
brought
in
a
manner
that's
compatible
with
the
procedural
limitations
such
as
statute
of
limitations,
procedural
default,
exhaustion,
teague
v.
lane,
if
they
surmount
those
hurdles,
then
the
interests
of
vindicating
the
constitution
take
precedence
over
the
interests
of
finality.
but
if
those
procedural
hurdles
have
not
been
met,
and
the
defendant
did
not
bring
his
claim
in
accordance
with
the
procedures
that
are
set
out,
then
society
is
entitled
to
take
that
conviction
as
conclusively
final,
and
any
further
remedy
that
would
be
available
would
have
to
come
from
the
executive
branch--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--under
this
court's
decision
in
custis
he
may
at
the
federal
sentencing
raise
it,
and
i--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
would
be
a
procedural
default,
justice
stevens,
and
i
think
it
would
bar
the
defendant
from
coming
back
even
if
there
were
otherwise
a
right
to
come
back
under
applicable
procedure.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
sentence
of
the...
the
underlying
conviction--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
if
the
underlying
conviction
sentence
had
not
been
served,
then
the
defendant's
remedy
would
be
to
go
back
into
the
jurisdiction
that
entered
it
and
see
if
he
can
comply
with--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
stevens,
because
he
has
the
right
to
do
that
under
custis
at
the
federal
sentencing
proceeding
itself,
and
the
failure
to
bring
that
claim
at
a
timely
point
in
the
proceeding,
when
it
is
available,
would
constitute
a
default,
and
then
he
would
be
left
with
the
argument--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel
isn't
even
permitted
to
be
brought
under
this
court's
decision
in
custis
with
respect
to
the
underlying
conviction.
with
respect
to
the
conviction
that...
the
federal
conviction
that
was
entered,
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claims
typically
are
not
brought
in
the
original
sentencing
court
that
imposed
the
conviction
because
the
defendant
typically
has
the
same
counsel
and
because
the
facts
haven't
been
developed,
and
therefore
there
is
no
procedural
default
typically
in
bringing
an
ineffective
assistance
claim
directed
to
the
federal
conviction
in
a
section
2255
proceeding.
but
as
to
the
underlying
enhancement
conviction,
which
is
what
we
are
talking
about
here,
petitioner
is
saying
that
i
suffered
from
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
with
respect
to
a
1978
robbery
conviction
that
is
now
being
used
to
enhance
my
1992
federal
sentence,
and
i
should
have
the
right,
on
2255,
to
litigate
that
16-year-old,
or
19-year-old
claim,
and
we
submit
that
the
court's
decision
in
custis
says
you
can't
do
that
at
the
federal
sentencing
and
you
therefore
cannot
do
that
on
the
2255
proceeding.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
fundamental
problem
with
that,
justice
souter,
is
that
those
same
interests
are
fully
at
stake
in
the
custis
situation
itself.
when
this
court
said--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--if
i
could
address
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
actually
is
not
the
question
that
the
court
left
open
in
custis,
justice
souter.
what
the
court
left
open
in
custis
is
the
following
scenario.
take
custis
himself.
after
custis
is
sentenced,
the
question
that
was
raised
in
custis
was,
could
he
then
go
back
to
the
state
court
that
had
entered
the
enhancement
conviction
and
obtain
a
judgment
that
that
conviction
was
constitutionally
invalid,
and
then
come
back
to
the
federal
sentencing
court
and
apply
for
reopening
of
his
federal
sentence,
and
the
crucial
difference
between
that
scenario
and
the
scenario
that's
presented
here
is
that
the
litigation
over
the
validity
of
that
sentence
would
take
place
in
the
state
court.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
litigation
on
federal
habeas
corpus
that
attacked
the
state
sentence.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
don't
think
that
that
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
don't
think
that
that's
what
the
opinion
says,
because
it
talks
about
custis
having
been
in
custody
still
on
his
state
sentences.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
federal
habeas
review
is
federal
review
under
2254--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
attacks
the
state
sentence.
this
is
a
case
under
section
2255,
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
the
federal
sentence.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
necessary--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
language
says,
i
think
accurately,
just
what
justice
stevens
read,
and
i
would
interpret
federal
habeas
review
in
that
context
to
mean
federal
review
under
2254
attacking
the
prior
state
sentence.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
if
it
were
not
limited
to
that,
it
would
be
odd
to
say
that
the
defendant
could
then
come
and
apply
for
reopening
of
this
federal
sentence,
because
that's
exactly
what
section
2255
is
all
about.
it
is
saying
there's
something
wrong
with
the
federal
sentence
that
was
imposed,
and
we
know
from
custis--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
the
theory
behind
section
2255
litigation
in
this
case
is
that
there
was
a
constitutional
violation
at
the
federal
sentencing.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
because
sentence
was
imposed
based
on
a
conviction
that,
although
facially
valid
and
never
set
aside
by
any
court,
might
be
unreliable
if
one
took
the
time
to
unpack
the
claim
that
petitioner
is
now
making
and
get
the
records
and
litigate
it
and
determine
whether
it's
valid
or
not,
and
the
custis
court
held
there
is
no
constitutional
violation
in
imposing
sentence
without
adjudicating
that
claim
and,
further,
by
leaving
open
the
question
that
we've
been
discussing,
the
court
made
clear
that
it's
not
inherently
indispensable
that
there
be
any
place
left
to
litigate
a
claim
that
is
based
on
a
conviction
that
is
16
years
old
in
this
case,
19
years
old,
that
the
two
convictions
the
petitioner
is
raising.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
souter,
i
think
the
fundamental
answer
to
that
question
goes
back
to
the
interests
in
finality
that
have
been
struck
in
this
court's
postconviction
jurisprudence
generally.
there
is
a
recognition
that
there
are
fundamental
interests
in
having
an
unconstitutional
conviction
overturned,
but
they
are
counterbalanced
by
other
interests
such
as
the
fairness
and
reliability
of
the
adjudication
of
that
claim.
now,
here
we
are
talking
about
a
claim
by
petitioner
that
when
he
entered
his
guilty
plea
16
years
ago
and
19
years
ago
he
wasn't
adequately
informed
about
one
of
the
elements
of
the
offense
and
therefore,
he
says,
he
didn't
enter
a
knowing
and
voluntary
guilty
plea.
now,
that's
the
kind
of
claim
that
can
routinely
be
made
on
direct
appeal
or
upon
an
immediate
post
conviction
attack,
and
it's
made
with
the
state
that
entered
the
judgment
as
a
party,
and
the
state
can
come
back
and
say
we
have
access
to
these
records,
they're
very
easy
to
determine,
you
can
see
that
the
judge
went
over
him,
the
various
elements,
or
his
lawyer
counseled
him
about
the
various
elements
of
the
crime
and
the
court
can
reach
a
reliable
adjudication
promptly
on
whether
that
conviction
is
valid.
a
defendant
who
doesn't
challenge
his
guilty
plea
in
that
fashion
at
the
time
that
it's
available
to
do
so
is
essentially
saying,
i
struck
a
deal
with
the
government,
the
deal
allows
me
perhaps
to
reduce
my
time
of
imprisonment
compared
to
what
it
would
have
been
if
i
had
gone
to
trial
and
lost,
as
i
probably
would
have
been,
would
have
lost,
therefore
i'm
going
to
enter
a
guilty
plea
and
establish
finality,
and
i'm
not
going
to
take
an
appeal,
because
if
i
appeal
and
win
at
this
juncture
i'll
probably
be
back
right
in
the
position
that
i
started
in,
namely,
facing
a
trial
and
a
potentially
longer
sentence.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
the
risk
that
he
faced,
justice
souter,
was
one
that
he
either
knew
actually
or
should
have
known
at
the
time
that
he
entered
that
plea.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
apart
from
the
fact
that
the
court
in
nichols
v.
united
states
said
that
it's
the
kind
of
thing
that
prisoners
do
know
when
they're
sentenced,
that
if
they're
seen
back
again
they're
going
to
face
more
serious
consequences
from
it--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
recidivism
statutes
are
among
the
most
common
kind
of
statutes
in
the
criminal
justice
world.
all
50
states
have
them.
the
federal
government
has
one.
there's
a
great
deal--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
but
there
has
long
been
a
tradition
in
this
country
of
recidivism
laws
that
fairly
significantly
escalated
the
potential
sentence
from
some
of
the
cases
that
i've
seen
from
5
years
to
35
years,
and
these
are
convictions
based
on
statutes
that
were
enacted
long
before
the
current
wave
of
three
strikes
statutes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
the
constitutional
holding
in
custis
had
anything
to
do
with
the
language
of
the
statutes.
the
court
concluded
that
the
statute
in
custis,
which
is
the
same
statute
at
issue
here,
didn't
authorize
these
kinds
of
challenges
at
the
sentencing
proceeding
and
it
then
went
on
to
hold
that
neither
did
the
constitution.
now,
petitioner's--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
but
there's
nothing--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
breyer,
i
accept
that
you've
attempted
to
carve
out
the
category
of
obvious
unconstitutionality
from
what
we're
dealing
with
in
this
realm,
but
i
submit
that
as
a
matter
of
real
life
litigation
it
doesn't
exist.
what
you
in
fact
get
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
are
records
just
like
this
one.
the
prisoner
comes
in--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--any
constitutional
rule
that
says
you
can
do
this
but
only
when
it's
really
obvious
is
going
to
lead
to
the
same
sorts
of
burdens
of
litigation
of
whether
it
falls
into
that
category
or
not,
and
it's
going
to
require
the
government,
when
confronted
with
one
of
these
things,
to
do
exactly
what
the
court
recognized
in
custis
was
an
extremely
burdensome
and
usually
unproductive
exercise
of
running
round
and
trying
to
find
the
prosecutor,
the
judge,
the
defense
lawyer,
the
probation
officer
who
were
part
of
the
original
sentencing
proceeding,
which
could
go
back
decades,
and
attempting
to
reconstruct--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
it
is
the
government's
problem,
because
the
prisoner
comes
in
with
an
affidavit
that
says,
i
was
there,
and
i'm
going
to
swear
out
as
a
factual
matter
no
one
ever
told
me
that
aiding
and
abetting
liability
required
that
i
join
in
this
venture
as
if
it
were
something
that
i
intended
to
succeed.
all
i
thought
is
that
if
i
was
present
and
i
knew
about
the
bank
robbery,
that
was
enough
for
the
conviction.
that
is
petitioner's
claim
right
here.
he's
filed
an
affidavit,
he's
sworn
it
out
under
oath,
and
for
the
government
to
sit
back
and
say
to
the
sentencing
court,
well,
judge,
he
has
a
strong
interest
in
this
and
this
was
20
years
ago,
you
shouldn't
believe
him,
is
really
more
than
can
be
expected
from
us.
we
need
to
respond
factually.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right,
justice
stevens.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right,
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
line
that
the
court
drew
in
custis,
and
it
essentially
says--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--custis
was
a
holding
first
on
the
meaning
of
924(e)
and
then
on
what
the
constitution
required
of
a
sentencing
judge,
and
it
held
a
sentencing
judge
may
accept
a
facially
valid--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--conviction
that
has
never
been
set
aside,
other
than--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
are
normally
other
chances
for
a
defendant
to
attack
his
prior
conviction,
the
direct
appeal
from
the
conviction,
postconviction
review
in
the
state,
and
postconviction
review
federally.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct,
and
the
court
didn't
say
that
this
is
an
indispensable
prerequisite
of
a
valid
federal
sentence.
what
it
said
was,
the
federal
sentencing
court
can
look
at
the
state
judgment
and
say,
on
its
face
there's
no
gideon
problem
here,
we're
not
required
to
entertain
other
constitutional
challenges.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
if
some
other
court
wants
to
entertain
them,
that's
to
be
presented
to
that
court.
the
rendering
court--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
i
don't
think
that's
unconstitutional.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
a,
an
expectation
that
the
prisoner
can
have
that
the
laws
give
him
notice
that
that's
what
the
laws
are
intended
to
do.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
stevens--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
is
a
view
that
the
government
has
taken
in
the
lower
courts.
we
have
lost
it
in
the
six
circuits
that
have
considered
it.
we're
currently
rethinking
what
our
position
is
on
that
issue.
that
issue
is
a
quite
distinct
issue
from
this
one.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
because
in
that
situation
the
federal
court,
instead
of
saying,
i
have
a
facially
valid
conviction
in
front
of
me
and
i
have
a
defendant
who
says
there's
something
wrong
with
it
but
he's
never
done
anything
about
it,
the
federal
court
in
this
latter
class
of
cases
has
a
conviction
that
it
previously
relied
on
and
said,
this
is
a
reliable
indication
that
you
are
a
more
serious
offender,
and
it
turns
out
that
a
later
state
court
judgment
may
have
set
it
aside
on
constitutional
grounds
that
fundamentally
call
into
question
reliability.
that's
a
distinguishable
scenario
from
this
situation,
and
the
outcome
there
does
not
control
the
outcome
here.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
justice
scalia
is
referring
to
a
statute
that
was
premised
on
the
following
theory.
if
you
know
you
have
a
conviction
on
the
books
and
you
are
not
deterred
from
the...
by
committing
another
crime,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
you
know
that
your
sentenced
will
be
enhanced,
the
question
is,
is
that
constitutional
apart
from
gideon
violations.
my
answer
to
that
is
yes,
but
i
don't
actually
think
that's
the
sentencing
theory
that
was
adopted
in
section
924(e).
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct,
and
if
it
were
of
the
sort,
i
would
submit
that
it's
constitutional,
but
the
question
is,
is
it
of
that
sort.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
i
think
the
answer
to
it
is
not.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think
it's
a
fortiori,
justice
scalia,
although
i
do
think
our
position
is
a
fortiori
from
custis,
and
the
reason
i
think
they're
distinct
is,
the
theory
of
the
sentencing
statute
that
you
have
posited
is
deterrence,
and
the
theory
of
the
recidivist
sentencing
statute,
that
is
924(e),
and
of
most
recidivist
statutes,
is
reliability
of
a
prior
conviction
which
shows
that
this
defendant
is
a
more
serious
offender
because
he
has
committed
crimes
in
the
past
which
aggravate
the
current
offense,
and
therefore
this
individual
warrants
greater
incapacitation
as
a
matter
of
protecting
the
public
because
he's
clearly
not
learning
but
is
going
on
to
commit
offense
after
offense
after
offense.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
united
states
took
the
position
in
custis
that
gideon
error
belonged
to
a
very
small
class
of
fundamental
errors,
and
the
other
error
that
we
identified
in
custis
was
the
error
that
you
identified,
justice
kennedy,
of
an
error
that
really
deprives
the
sentencing
court
of
the
character
of
a
court
that
could
render
a
fair
judgment.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
because
this
court
in
custis
didn't
agree
with
the
position
of
the
government
and
held
that
gideon
violations
are
unique.
they
are
unique
not
only
because
they
have
such
a
pervasive
impact
on
the
fairness
of
the
proceeding,
but
they
are
also
unique
in
that
they
are
fairly
easy
to
discern
from
the
judgment
role
or
from
a
motion
accompanying
the
judgment
role,
and
the
court
relied
on
the
consideration
of
administrative
ease
as
well
as
of
the
character
of
the
error
in
defining
what
you
could
do
when
confronted
with
a
recidivist
enhancement
and
a
prior
conviction
that
is
challenged
on
constitutional
grounds,
and
so
long
as
the
court
adheres
to
that
line,
i
think
that
the
interest
of
the
state
in
ensuring
that
its
judgment
carries
usual
force
and
effect
are
just
as
strong
at
the
federal
sentencing
proceeding
as
they
are
on
2255.
the
state--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
that's
the
question
that
we're
revisiting
after
our
litigation
track
record
in
the
lower
courts,
and
it's
not
presented
in
this
case
because
petitioner
did
not
do
that,
and
almost
undoubtedly
would
be
out
of
time
to
do
that
today,
and
quorum
nobis
is
not
apparently
available
in
california,
and
our
fundamental
submission
is,
that
was
the
chance
that
he
had.
whatever
procedures
the
rendering
court
provides
and
post
conviction
review
provides
of
the
underlying
conviction
are
sufficient
for
constitutional
purposes
absent
a
gideon
error
when
the
federal
sentencing
court
is
imposing
a
recidivist
sentence.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--thank
you.
