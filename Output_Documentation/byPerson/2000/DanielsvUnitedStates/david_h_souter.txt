justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
the
state
uses
the
conviction,
it's...
the
conviction
is
just
as
unreliable
when
the
state
uses
it
as
when
the
feds
use
it,
and
i
take
it
the
reason
that
you
concede
that
the
state
could
use
it
is
that
there
was
an
understanding,
or
we
have
to
assume
that
there
was
an
understanding
on
the
part
of
the
prisoner
that
this
kind
of
collateral
use
and
enhancement
of
later
sentences
might
be
a
consequence
of
that
conviction,
and
yet
he
did
nothing
about
it.
is
that
essentially
your
theory?
in
other
words,
he
knew
what
the
risks
were,
and
he
did
not
take
any
steps
to
alleviate
those
risks
by
bringing
a
state
collateral
attack
or
by
going
on
with
his
appeal
or
whatnot.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
doesn't...
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
you...
that
was
part
of
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the
other
part?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
no,
but
let's
forget
federal
proceedings
for
a
moment.
if
we
just
have
a
state
proceeding
and
the
state
is
going
to
use
that
supposedly
unreliable
conviction
as
a
basis
for
enhancement
following
a
subsequent
conviction,
nothing
unfair
about
that,
i
take
it,
on
your
view,
because
the
prisoner
knew
that
such
use
could
be
made
of
it,
and
the
prisoner
let
the
time
for
attacking
the
conviction
pass.
that's
essentially
your
theory?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
are
they?
i
mean,
i...
if
it's
not
unfair
for
the
state
to
use
it,
despite
the
assumption
of
its
unreliability,
what
would
a...
what
other
due
process
problem
might
arise
at
the
state
level?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
would
be
the
problem,
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
the
state...
but
i...
the
theory
of
my
question
was,
he
in
effect
was
on
notice
that
there
might
be
a
subsequent
use
of
the
conviction
for
enhancement
purposes.
he
had
an
opportunity
to
litigate.
he
didn't
litigate.
therefore,
it
is
not
unfair,
in
the
due
process
sense,
for
the
state
to
use
it,
and
i
thought
that
was
probably
what
underlay
your
suggestion
that
the
state
could
use
it
for
enhancement
purposes.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
now,
why
can't
the
fed...
why
can't
a
federal
court
use
it
for
enhancement
purposes?
he
was
on
notice
that
there
might
be
a
later
enhancement.
he
did
nothing
about
it.
the
same
reasoning
applies
at
the
federal
level,
doesn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
not
waiver.
not...
we're
not
talking
about
waiver.
we
talking
about,
i
think,
the
fact
that
he
had
an
opportunity
to
litigate
it.
as
you
so...
as
you
conceded
a
moment
ago,
there
are
statutes
of
limitations
that
govern
these
things
in
most
instances.
you've
got
to
litigate
within
that
time
or
it's
too
late,
so
he
let,
in
effect,
his
opportunity
to
litigate
pass.
now,
if
that...
and
therefore
it's
not
unfair,
in
a
due
process
sense,
to
use
it
against
him
even
if
he
does
claim
later
that
it
was
unreliable.
now,
if
that
is
a
sound
argument
with
respect
to
its
use
for
enhancement
purposes
at
the
state
level,
why
isn't
it
an
equally
good
argument
with
respect
to
its
use
in
this
case
at
the
federal
level?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
what's
left
of
the
statute
of
limitations
that
you
concede
can
be
applied?
i
thought
you
conceded
that
the
statute
of
limitations
on
this
kind
of
litigation
could,
consistently
with
due
process,
be
applied
at
the
state
level.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--with
respect
to,
at
the
state
level,
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question.
let's
assume
that
the
state
had
a
statute
and
the
statute
were
made...
was
explained
to
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
his
state
sentence,
and
the
statute
read
as
follows:
this
conviction
can
be
used
to
enhance
sentences
following
later
convictions.
if
you
wish
to
challenge
the
validity
of
this
conviction,
you
must
challenge
it
within
1
year,
or
it's
too
late.
let's
assume
that
the
state
had
such
a
statute,
that
was
explained
to
the
prisoner
at
the
time
of
the
first
sentence,
and
he
didn't
litigate
within
1
year.
the
state
then
wants
to
use
it
to
enhance
following
a
subsequent
conviction.
is
there
a
due
process
problem
in
the
state's
use
of
it
without
an
opportunity
to
challenge?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
there
can...
i
take
it
your
theory,
then,
is
that
no
amount
of
warning
in
the
world
will
ever
be
enough
to
allow
the
state
or
the
federal
government
to
treat
the
first
conviction
with
finality?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
about
my
limitation?
you've
got
a
year
to
challenge
this
if
you
want
to
challenge
it,
and
if
you
don't
challenge
it
within
the
year
it's
too
late
and
it
can
used
for
enhancement
purposes,
and
the
year
expires,
it's
going
to
be
used
for
enhancement
purposes,
he
wants
to
challenge
it,
and
the
state
says
no,
it's
too
late,
the
year
is
over.
is
that
consistent
with
due
process?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
it's
the
therefore
part
that
i
guess
is
giving
us
all
the
trouble,
and
the
reason
it's
giving
me
trouble
is,
number
1...
of
course,
i
was
a
dissenter
in
custis,
so
maybe
i'm
looking
for
trouble--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
the
court
in...
the
majority
in
custis
left
the
question
open
whether
there
could
be
another
means
of
challenge
other
than
the
challenge
at
the
federal
sentencing
proceeding
as
such.
and
number
2,
textually,
what
the
petitioner
wants
to
do
can
be
fitted
within
the
terms
of
2255,
and
the
issue
i
guess
boils...
so
i
think
it's...
i
don't
think
custis
is
controlling,
and
what
the
issue
boils
down
to
for
me
is
this.
i
will...
i
accept
your
argument
that
the
balance
struck
on
the
issues
of
finality
and
fairness
require
a
point
at
which
so
far
as
the
service
of
the
original
sentence,
the
'78
sentence
in
your
example
is
concerned,
the
litigation
has
got
to
stop.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
balance
is
entirely
different
when
you
get
into
the
subsequent
proceeding
in
which,
for
example,
what
is
at
stake
in
the
finality
fairness
argument
is
not,
say,
a
sentence
of
5
years
or
10
years
as
under
the
first
conviction,
whatever
it
was,
but
a
sentence
potentially
of
life,
and
when
suddenly
the
stakes
change
that
radically
in
the
federal
proceeding,
then
the
old
finality
fairness
balance
simply
doesn't
apply
any
more
because
the
terms
have
changed,
and
when
the
terms
change
radically,
as
they
have
here,
why
isn't
it
possible
to
reassess
that
balance
and
say,
okay,
now,
even
though
you
couldn't
litigate
for
state
purposes,
you
can
litigate
for
federal
purposes?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
custis...
that
may
be
true,
but
number
1,
custis
depended
in
part
on
a
statutory
construction
reason.
they
looked
at
the
text
of
the
sentencing
enhancement
statute
and,
number
2,
custis
left
this
question
open.
the
court
said--
justice
david
h.
souter
--we're
not
telling
you
what
we'll
do
in
this
subsequent
situation,
but
they
left
it
open.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
you're
entirely
right,
but
didn't...
i
don't
have
it
in
front
of
me.
didn't
the
court
also
refer
to
the
possibility
of
litigation
on
federal
habeas?
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
but
the
only
basis
on
which
there
could
be
federal
habeas
litigation
would
be
federal
habeas
litigation
in
connection
with
the
later
federal
sentence,
even
though
the
subject
of
that
litigation
might
be,
or
would
be
the
validity
of
the
earlier
state
sentence--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
therefore
it
seems
to
me
this
was
left
open.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
certainly
does
include
that.
i
don't
know
that
it
was
limited.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
reason
may
be
the
textual
reason
in
custis,
going
to
the
text
of
the
enhancement
statute
itself.
it
may
be
that
we
wanted
sentencing,
congress
wanted
sentencing
to
be
clean
and
simple
and
leaving
any
later
attack
to
be
worked
out
afterwards.
in
other
words,
get
him
shut
away
and
then
let
him
litigate
as
long
as
he
wants
to.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume,
though...
and
i
realize
you
don't
concede
this,
of
course,
but
assume
that
custis
did
leave
open
the
possibility
of
this
litigation.
would
you
go
back
to
the,
we'll
say
the
balance
argument?
my
point
is
that
the
balance
between
finality
and
fairness
changes
radically
when
you
go
from
the
limited
jeopardy
of
imprisonment
under
the
state
conviction
to
the
potentiality
here
of
life
imprisonment,
and
if
the
balance
is
that
radically
affected,
why
shouldn't
there
be,
for
due
process
purposes,
an
opportunity
to
litigate
at
the
federal
level,
even
though
the
state
proceeding
is
past
and
final
for
state
purposes?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it's
perfectly
fair
for
due
process
purposes
or
any
others,
on
any
other
fairness
standard,
to
hold
the
prisoner
to
that
bargain.
he
knew
what
the
terms
were.
the
trouble
is
now,
the
terms
have
changed,
and
it's
not
only
very
difficult
to
litigate
this
later,
but
it's
also
very
difficult
to
stay
in
prison
for
life,
and
when
the
terms
have
changed,
the
calculus
that
says,
or
that
said
in
the
first
instance
it's
fair
to
hold
you
to
your
bargain,
doesn't
apply
any
more,
because
the
terms
have
changed.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
let's...
i
understand
that
argument,
too,
and
i
just
don't
see
how
it
is
sound.
the
truth
is,
in
the
real
world,
prisoners,
when
they
enter
these
guilty
pleas,
are
not
thinking
of
the
possibility
of
life
in
prison
25
years
later
for
a
crime
that
hasn't
been
committed
yet.
i
mean,
i
just
don't
think
that
that
is
realistic,
to
say
that
he
knew
or
should
have
known
that
this
could
happen.
justice
david
h.
souter
they...
more
serious
consequences,
yes,
but
this
is
a
serious
consequence
of
a
different
order
of
magnitude.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
recidivism,
yes,
but
we're...
at
least
at
this
point
in
history
we're
living
at
a
time
when
a
great
many
prior
convictions
are
being
considered
under
three
strikes
laws--
justice
david
h.
souter
--let
alone
a
federal
three
strikes
law
which
couldn't
possibly
have
been
in
the
contemplation
of
the
people
who
entered
the
guilty
pleas
or
suffered
the
convictions
25
years
ago.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
the
prisoner's
problem.
the
government
doesn't
have
to
do
that.
