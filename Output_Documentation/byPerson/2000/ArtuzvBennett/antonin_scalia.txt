mr.
schweitzer,
the
problem
i
have
with
your
position
is,
i
don't
know
how
you
can
get
out
of
the
word
properly
the
kind
of
line
that
you
want
to
draw.
i
can
see
how
you
can
say,
properly
filed
means,
you
know,
the
technical
things,
the
proper
court,
the
name's
right,
that
i
can
understand,
but
you
want
to
say
it
includes
procedural
bars,
that
the
claim
is
invalid
on
the
merits
because
of
a...
it's
invalid
because
of
a
procedural
bar.
if
that
is
embraced
within
the
word,
properly
filed,
why
wouldn't
the
fact
that
the
claim
is
unmeritorious
for
a
substantive
reason
be
included
as
well?
it's
not
properly
filed
if
it's
a...
you
know,
it's
a
ridiculous,
nonmeritorious
complaint.
how
do
you
get
the
word
properly
to
cover
only
procedural
bars
and
not
substantive
bars?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
also
if
it
makes
a
frivolous
merits
claim.
you
could
say
that's
not
properly
filed.
there's
no
substance
to
it.
justice
antonin

this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
in
a
1984
jury
trial
in
the
supreme
court
of
new
york
for
queens
county,
respondent
tony
bruce
bennett
was
convicted
of
a
number
of
offenses
including
attempted
murder.
the
convictions
were
upheld
on
direct
appeal.
in
1995,
bennett
moved
in
state
court
to
vacate
his
judgment
of
conviction.
for
purposes
of
this
case,
we
assume
that
that
action
is
still
pending,
but
that
it
is
subject
to
state
procedural
bars
since
it
raises
claims
that
were
raised
or
could
have
been
raised
on
direct
appeal.
in
1998,
bennett
brought
the
present
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
federal
district
court.
the
district
court
summarily
dismissed
the
petition
as
untimely
under
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act
of
1996
,aedpa,
which
imposes
a
one
year
statute
of
limitations
on
suits
for
federal
habeas,
but
tolls
that
limitation
period,
while
a
“properly
filed”
application
for
state
habeas
relief
is
pending.
on
the
assumptions
under,
which
we
took
this
case
that
tolling
provision,
28
u.s.c.
section
2244(d)(2)
would
apply
here
and
would
allow
the
present
suit
unless
an
application
that
is
procedurally
barred
is
not
within
the
terms
of
the
statute
“properly
filed”.
the
second
circuit
reversed
and
remanded,
it
concluded
that
bennett’s
application
for
state
postconviction
relief
was
properly
filed
since
even
though
it
was
procedurally
barred,
it
complied
with
the
rules
governing
whether
an
application
for
state
postconviction
relief
is
“recognized
as
such”
under
state
law.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
affirm.
we
hold,
that
in
order
to
be
properly
filed
for
purposes
of
2244(d)(2),
an
application
for
state
postconviction
relief
need
not
comply
with
all
mandatory
state
law
procedural
requirements
that
would
bar
review
of
the
merits
of
the
application.
an
application
is
filed
as
that
term
is
commonly
understood
when
it
is
delivered
to,
and
accepted
by
the
appropriate
court
officer
for
placement
into
the
official
record,
and
an
application
is
properly
filed
when
its
delivery
and
acceptance
are
in
compliance
with
the
applicable
laws
and
rules
governing
filings.
these
usually
prescribe,
for
example,
the
form
of
the
document,
certain
kinds
of
time
limits
upon
its
delivery,
the
court
and
office
in
which
it
must
be
lodged,
and
the
requisite
filing
fee.
petitioner
contends
that
such
an
interpretation
of
the
statutory
phrase
renders
the
word
“properly”,
and
possibly
both
words
“properly
filed”,
surplusage,
since
if
the
provision
omitted
those
words,
and
tolled
simply
for
“the
time
during,
which
an
application
for
state
postconviction
relief
is
pending”,
it
would
necessarily
condition
tolling
on
compliance
with
filing
requirements
of
the
sort
described
above.
we
disagree.
if,
for
example,
an
application
is
erroneously
accepted
by
the
clerk
of
a
court
lacking
jurisdiction,
or
is
erroneously
accepted
without
the
requisite
filing
fee,
it
would
be
pending,
but
not
properly
filed,
and
we
reject
petitioner’s
position
for
a
more
fundamental
reason
as
well.
by
construing
properly
filed
application
to
mean
application
raising
claims
that
are
not
mandatorily
procedurally
barred,
petitioner
elides
the
difference
between
an
application
and
the
claim.
only
individual
claims,
and
not
the
application
containing
those
claims,
can
be
procedurally
defaulted
under
state
law
pursuant
to
our
holdings
in
coleman
versus
thompson
and
wainwright
versus
sykes,
which
establish
the
sort
of
procedural
bar
on
which
petitioner
here
relies.
ignoring
this
distinction
would
require
judges
to
engage
in
verbal
gymnastics
when
an
application
contains
some
claims
that
are
procedurally
barred
and
some
that
are
not.
presumably
a
court
would
have
to
say
that
the
application
is
“properly
filed”
as
to
the
non-barred
claims,
and
not
“properly
filed”
as
to
the
rest.
the
statute,
however,
refers
only
to
“properly
filed”
applications
and
does
not
contain
the
peculiar
suggestion
that
a
single
application
can
be
both
“properly
filed”
and
not
“properly
filed.”
the
state
procedural
bars
at
issue
in
this
case
new
york
criminal
procedural
law
section
440.10(2)(a)
and
(c)
simply
prescribe
a
rule
of
decision
for
a
court
confronted
with
claims
that
were
previously
determined
on
the
merits
of
an
appeal
or
that
could
have
been
raised
on
direct
appeal
but
were
not.
the
way
the
statute
reads,
“the
court
must
deny”
such
claims
for
relief.
neither
provision
purports
to
set
forth
a
condition
to
filing,
as
opposed
to
a
condition
for
obtaining
relief.
consequently,
the
alleged
failure
of
respondent's
application
to
comply
with
him
does
not
render
respondent’s
application
improperly
filed
for
purposes
of
§2244(d)(2).
the
court’s
decision
is
unanimous.
