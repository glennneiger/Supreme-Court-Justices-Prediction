mr.
dan
schweitzer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
language,
structure,
and
objectives
of
section
2244(d)
tell
us
that
congress
intended
the
tolling
provision
to
harmonize
the
limitations
period
and
the
exhaustion
doctrine.
respondent's
construction
of
the
term,
properly
filed
application,
undermines
the
limitation
period
and
reads
the
word
properly
out
of
the
statute.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
some
of
the
federalism
questions
that
were
raised
in
terms
of
how
the
state's
construction
of
the
term
furthers
the
state's
federalism
interests.
it
does
so
when
we
recognize
the
fact
that
the
limitations
period
itself
was
enacted
by
congress
to
further
the
state's
comity
concerns
by
speeding
up
the
date
at
which
the
federal
habeas
process
will
take
place.
congress
was
motivated
by
the
fact
that
it
often
took
many,
many
years
for
the
federal
courts
to
possibly
order
a
new
trial,
or
generally
to
provide
finality
to
the
state
conviction.
it
may
be
that
as
a
consequence
of
the
state
rule
there
will
be
a
protective
federal
filing
such
as
that
which
justice
breyer
and
justice
stevens
mentioned.
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
this
may
take
place
at
the
same
time
that
the
state
proceeding
is
occurring,
it
still
furthers
the
state's
comity
interest,
because
often
the
state...
the
federal
court
will
be
able
to
recognize
that
the
application
is
plainly
procedurally
barred,
at
which
point
the
federal
court
can
proceed
to
rule
on
the
habeas
application
and
would
be
doing
so
many
years
sooner
than
it
otherwise
would
have
been,
which
is
precisely
the
goal
that
congress
had
in
enacting
the
limitation--
mr.
dan
schweitzer
--where
it's
not
clear,
and
so
the
prisoner
isn't
certain--
mr.
dan
schweitzer
--right.
mr.
dan
schweitzer
though
i
should
make
clear,
a
large
percentage
of
these
cases
will
be
the
frivolous
ones,
the
second,
third,
fifth
applications,
but--
mr.
dan
schweitzer
--right.
in
that
case
where
the
protective
federal
habeas
filing
is
made,
and
the
federal
court
looks
at
the
case
and
says,
it's
a
close
call
whether
or
not
the
state
procedure
is
available,
so
it
might
be
possible
for
the
state
remedies
to
be
exhausted.
at
that
point
the
federal
court
would
dismiss
the
federal
application
under
rose
v.
lundy.
mr.
dan
schweitzer
right.
if,
upon
return
to
the
state
court,
the
state
court
says,
in
fact,
this
is
procedurally
barred,
in
that
case
we
believe
would
be
an
appropriate
instance
for
equitable
tolling
to
toll
that
time
back--
mr.
dan
schweitzer
--right,
but
the
time
back
in
state
court
would
equitably
toll
the
federal
1-year
limitations
provision.
mr.
dan
schweitzer
well,
if
the
federal
court,
upon
looking
at
the
habeas
petition
says,
this
might,
in
fact,
be
a
proper
case
to
be
back
in
the
state
courts,
there
may
be
those
state
remedies
available.
if
the
prisoner
properly
invokes
those
very
state
remedies
that
the
federal
court
had
in
mind--
mr.
dan
schweitzer
--well,
the
federal--
mr.
dan
schweitzer
--but
in
essence,
since
the
state
prisoner
shouldn't
be
penalized
for
the
federal
court
being
wrong,
we
think
that
would
be
an
appropriate
time
for
the
limitations
period
to
be
tolled.
it's
presumptive
that
federal
statutes
have
equitable
tolling
available,
and
we
don't
challenge
that
here.
mr.
dan
schweitzer
well,
the
first
answer
to
that
question
is
that
we
think
it
makes
sense
to
believe
that
congress
took
the
word...
inserted
the
word
properly
here
and
created
the
phrase,
properly
filed
application,
borrowing
from
its
past
use
of
the
word
properly
with
respect
to
the
terms,
proper
exhaustion,
and
proper
presentation,
both
of
which
deal
with
the
presentation
of
claims
to
state
courts
which,
if
it's
properly
done,
provides
the
state
courts
with
the
opportunity
to
rule
on
the
merits,
regardless
of
how
the
court
ultimately
rules
on
that
merits
decision.
in
terms
of
the
question
respondents
focus
on,
which
is,
how
does
properly
modify
file,
it's
just
that
it
means
more
than
mere
filing
requirements.
respondents
treat
the
word
properly
as
merely
modifying
how
a
document
is
filed,
almost
the
physical
manner
by
which
it's
filed,
but
properly
can
also
be
read
to
modify
the
question
of
whether
the
document
should
have
been
filed
in
the
first
place.
if
the
lawyer
drafts
a
complaint
that
clearly
violates
rule
11,
but
then
files
that
complaint
anyway,
that's
an
improper
act
on
the
part
of
the
attorney,
and
it
would
be
an
improperly
filed
complaint.
mr.
dan
schweitzer
well,
in
the
habeas
corpus
context,
where
there's
such
a
focus
on
compliance
with
the
various
procedural
bars,
and
where
the
procedural
default
context
expressly
exists
to
accommodate
the
situations
where
state
procedural
rules
aren't
complied
with,
but
prisoners
aren't
considered
to
have
done
anything
wrong
if
they
have
exhausted
their
state
remedies
but
lost
on
the
merits,
we
think
that
same...
congress
had
that
same
mind
set
here,
where
the
prisoner
isn't
treated
as
having
done
anything
wrong,
having
done
anything
improper
or
incorrect
by
bringing
losing
claims,
but
the
prisoner
has
done
something
wrong
by
bringing
claims
that
are
barred
by
mandatory
state
court
rules,
and
then
attempting
to
delay
the
limitations
period,
possibly
indefinitely,
by
filing
repetitive,
improper
claims
in
the
state
court.
mr.
dan
schweitzer
well,
florida
has
a
2-year
limitations
on
noncapital
cases
and
a
1-year
limitation
on
capital
cases,
both
of
which
have
exceptions
for
new
facts
or
new
law,
and
mere
existence
of
that
exception
means
that
under
respondent's
theory
you
can
violate
the
time
bar,
and
that's...
and
it
would
still
be
a
properly
filed
application.
mr.
dan
schweitzer
yes.
mr.
dan
schweitzer
i
wouldn't
want
to
speculate
as
to
why
congress
didn't
do
a
better
job
of
defining
the
exact
contours
of
the
tolling
provision,
but
i
don't
think
that
an
ambiguity
in
the
statute
requires
an
answer
one
way
or
the
other.
i
think
for
better
or
for
worse
we're
left
with
the
task
of
trying
to
determine
what
makes
sense
in
light
of
the
limitations
period
generally.
mr.
dan
schweitzer
because
the
problem,
without
reading
more
into
it,
is
that
it
would
essentially
allow
subsection
2
of
2244(d),
the
tolling
provision,
undermine
subsection
1,
the
limitations
period,
and
it's
an
unusual
provision
of
law
which
defeats
itself.
as
mr.
castellano
mentioned,
if
subsection
2,
the
tolling
provision,
is
read
as
respondent
suggests,
then
repetitive
filings
can
be
made
by
the
prisoners
who,
at
will,
can
extend
the
limitations
period
indefinitely,
and
there's
certainly
no--
