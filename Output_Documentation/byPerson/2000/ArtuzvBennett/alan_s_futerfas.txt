mr.
alan
s.
futerfas
yes,
you
are,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
state
of
new
york
has
stood
before
you
for
the
last
half
an
hour,
as
well
as
attorney
general
from
florida,
and
argued
for
a
rule
which,
if
adopted,
will
ensure
that
thousands
of
prisoners
will
file
their
federal
habeas
petitions
before
exhausting
their
state
post
conviction
remedies.
if
adopted,
it
will
be
malpractice
for
a
lawyer,
we
respectfully
submit,
not
to
file
in
federal
court
first,
or
as
soon
as
possible,
because
the
defendant
and
the
lawyer
will
never
know
under
the
state's
rule
whether
or
not
they
are
properly
filed
until
it
is
determined
whether
or
not
their
claims
are
procedurally
barred.
we
respectfully
suggest
that
that
rule
is
inconsistent
with
2244(d)(2),
other
provisions
of
the
aedpa,
and
this
court's
decisions
which
encourage
exhaustion.
mr.
alan
s.
futerfas
as
we
state
in
the
brief
in
the
second
circuit,
and
in
fact
the
majority
of
the
circuits,
i
tend
to
disagree
with
petitioner.
there
are
a
number
of
circuits
who
have
construed
this
in--
mr.
alan
s.
futerfas
--our
position
is,
a
properly
filed
application
is
an
application
which
is
delivered
to
the
custodian
designated
to
receive
it
in
accordance
with
the
rules
governing
its
acceptance
for
filing.
mr.
alan
s.
futerfas
it's
not
properly
filed.
properly
filed...
the
word
properly,
we
respectfully
submit,
has
meaning,
has
real
meaning.
prisoners
who
want
to
exhaust
their
state
remedies,
congress
has
created
a
simple
mechanism
for
them
to
do
so,
but
they
must
follow
it
accurately.
they
must
file
the
right
document
with
the
right
custodian
in
the
right
time.
it's
a
burden
placed--
mr.
alan
s.
futerfas
--that's
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
futerfas
yes.
when
we
look
at
what--
mr.
alan
s.
futerfas
--they
have
to
require...
our
position
is...
our
position,
we
respectfully
submit,
respects
state
court
systems.
if
a
state
court
sets
up
a
procedure
for
its
judicial
screening,
prisoners
are
on
notice
through
the
word
properly
that
they
have
to
file
that.
they
have
to
get
it
to
the
right
recipient,
whether
it's
a
judge
or
a
clerk,
and
they
have
to
put
it
in
the
right
document,
on
the
right
time,
and
we
think
it's
a
simple
mechanism,
but
it's
one
that...
you
know,
congress
has
kind
of
allocated
burdens
and
risks
here.
they
want
state
petitioners
to
be
able
to
exhaust
and
not
have
to
worry
about
making
a
protective
filing.
they
don't
have
to
worry
about
going
to
federal
court,
but
they
have
to
do
it
right.
mr.
alan
s.
futerfas
that's
exactly
the
problem.
if...
and
i
call
it,
for
lack
of
a
better
word,
the
uncertainty
principle.
if
a
petitioner,
or
the
lawyer
knows
with
certainty
that
tolling
will
be
affected,
the
lawyer
will
not
have
to
file
a
protective
filing,
but
if
there's
uncertainty
as
to
whether
tolling
will
be
affected,
that
uncertainty
creates,
there's
no
question,
as
i
stated
in
my
opening
statement,
that
it
be
almost
malpractice
not
to
file
a
protective
filing,
and
what's
wrong
with
protective
filings?
i
think
the
petitioner
takes
a
somewhat
relaxed
view
of
how
federal
district
court
judges
are
going
to
view
protective
filings.
i
don't
think
federal
district
court
judges
are
going
to
be
happy
with
them
at
all.
what
really
will
happen
if
there's
uncertainty
of
tolling
is
that
all
state...
word
gets
around
quickly
in
the
jails.
we
all
know
that.
this
court
knows
that.
these
state
prisoners
will
begin
filing
first
in
federal
court,
and
what
they
will
be
seeking
and
obtaining
is
essentially
a
declaratory
judgment
by
the
federal
judge
on
state
substantive
and
procedural
law,
so
they'll
have
a
federal
judge
in
the
first
instance
say,
okay,
these
three
claims
are
exhausted,
these
four
claims
are
not
exhausted,
so
now
you
can
go
back.
and
now,
of
course,
the
certainty
of
tolling,
which
congress
set
up
to
be
in
the
mechanism
of
the
properly
filed
application,
now
that
certainty
of
tolling
is
resulted
by
pronouncement
of
a
federal
district
court
judge
and,
of
course,
this
increases
a
federal
judge's
workload
immeasurably,
because
many
of
these
claims,
or
some
percentage
of
these
claims
where
a
state
prisoner
is
exhausting
will
be
resolved.
maybe
the
state
prisoner
will
get
relief
on
the
merits
in
state
court,
and
they'll
never
have
to
bother
a
federal
district
court
judge.
but
if
there's
uncertainty
of
tolling,
the
federal
judge
will
deal
with
all
these
cases
before
they're
allowed
to
run
through
the
state
court
system.
and
the
other
thing
to,
i
think
respectfully
to
focus
on
is,
as
this
court
stated
unanimously
in
michael
williams
v.
taylor,
quote,
we
start
as
always
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
this
statute
says,
properly
filed
application.
properly
is
an
adverb,
modifying
the
verb
filed.
the
subject
of
that
phrase
is
an
application.
the
state
and
amici
have
suggested
that
although
congress
chose
the
words,
properly
filed
application,
it
really
meant
to
say
something
else,
a
properly
presented
claim,
an
application
presenting
claims
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
raise,
but
in
fact,
congress
had
all
of
that
phraseology
and
language
at
its
disposal,
and
it's
used
that
very
language
in
other
parts
of
the
statute.
for
instance,
where
congress
sought
to
define
exhaustion,
they
did
so.
2254(c),
as
this
court's
recognized
in
the
wainwright
and
duckworth
and
o'sullivan
decisions,
that
statute
defines
exhaustion,
so
if
congress...
if
congress
wanted
to
write
a
statute
that
conditioned
tolling
on
actual
exhaustion,
they
could
have
simply
said
that
tolling
will
occur
with
a
properly
filed
application
presenting
questions
the
applicant
has
the
right
to
raise
by
any
available
procedure.
that
language
was
right
there
for
congress
to
use
just
a
few
pages
later,
after
2244.
congress
did
not
use
that
language.
where
congress
sought
to
limit
successive
applications
and
predicate
tolling
on
one
application
only,
they
did
so
not
in
one
but
in
two
places,
2244(b)(3),
which
requires
judicial
approval,
and
2263
in
the
opting
provision,
where
you
have
tolling
for
a
first
post
conviction
application,
so
congress
had
that
language
available
it
could
have
used.
in
the
very
statute
at
issue,
2244,
congress
specifically
sought
to
address
a
claim
presented
in
an
application.
those
series
of
words
occur
a
number
of
times,
at
2244(b)(1),
(b)(2),
and
(b)(4).
so
all
of
this
language
that
the
petitioner
suggests
really,
congress
really
meant
to
say,
was
used,
and
under
this
court's
decisions
we
start
with
the
language
of
the
statute
and
i
think
in
this
case
we
also
end
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
alan
s.
futerfas
i'm
not
sure
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
alan
s.
futerfas
well,
in
terms
of
tolling,
i
don't
think
it
would
have
any
effect.
rules
governing
the
granting
of
an
application,
which
is
i
think
what
your
honor's
question
concerns,
rules
governing
whether
an
application
shall
be
granted,
whether
relief
shall
be
granted,
are
different
than
state
rules
governing
the
filing
of
the
application,
so
in
one
instance
whether
a
defendant's
claims
are
procedurally
barred
or
not
should
not
have
any
effect
on
whether
they
toll
the
statute.
we
suggest
that
properly
filed
application
was
meant
to
promote
federalism,
promote
defendants--
mr.
alan
s.
futerfas
--and
encourage
them
to
exhaust.
mr.
alan
s.
futerfas
well,
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question,
certainly
the
time...
if
the
application
is
filed
and
it
contains
barred
claims...
that's...
under
the
hypothetical
it
contains
barred
claims,
the
time
is
tolling.
i
think
the
best
way
i
can
answer
your
honor's
question
is
to
suggest
that
if
we
don't...
if
it's
not
tolling,
and
the
defendant's
petition
in
state
court
contains
barred
claims,
and
there's
not
tolling
occurring--
mr.
alan
s.
futerfas
--then
this
court's
decisions,
for
example
in
the
coleman
case,
where
this
court
has
a
whole
body
of
law
governing
cause
in
prejudice
or
miscarriage
of
justice,
that
will
essentially
almost
be
rendered
a
nullity,
because
yes,
a
defendant
can
have...
can
be
procedurally
barred,
and
procedurally
defaulted,
and
have
waived
everything,
and
not
really
present
a
good
procedural
picture
when
it
gets
to
the
federal
court.
but
at
least
under
coleman,
and
the
other
decisions
of
this
court,
at
least
when
the
defendant
gets
there,
if
the
defendant
can
prove
cause
in
prejudice,
if
the
defendant
can
show
a
miscarriage
of
justice,
then
a
federal
habeas
court
can
overlook
those
procedural
defaults
and
still
reach
the
merits.
however,
if,
under
the
state...
if
the
state's
rule
is
adopted,
the
state
determines
that
there's
procedural
bar,
it
makes
that
determination
a
year
after...
you
know,
after
1
year
has
passed,
now
the
whole
jurisprudence
allowing
delving
into
the
merits
on
cause
in
prejudice
will
not
happen,
because
now
the
state
prisoner
can't
even
get
before
a
federal
court
because
the
statute's
been
tolled.
mr.
alan
s.
futerfas
well,
you...
in...
i'm
not...
i
apologize,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
honor's
question--
mr.
alan
s.
futerfas
--yes.
mr.
alan
s.
futerfas
no,
that's
right.
mr.
alan
s.
futerfas
we
understand
that,
but
that
assumes,
obviously,
that
the
defendant
can
file,
and
that
the
tolling
is
occurring,
so
the
defendant
can
at
least
get
into
the
door
in
federal
court
and
try
at
least
to
avail
himself
or
herself
of
the
coleman
doctrine.
there
were...
there
was
a
question
of
petitioner,
i
believe
by
justice
souter
concerning
whether
or
not
the
statute
would
be
mooted.
i
think
that
was
the
essence
of
the
question,
and
we
suggest
that
it
would
be.
if...
i
think
we
can
safely
assume
that
adoption
of
the
state's
rule
would
encourage
protective
filings.
the
result
will
be,
we
respectfully
submit,
as
if
congress
said
there's
a
1-year
limitations
period
which
is
tolled
where
a
federal
court
finds
a
mixed
petition,
because
that
essentially
will
be
the
result,
the
practical
result
of
adoption
of
the
state's
rule.
the...
there
were
concerns
certainly
raised
in
petitioner's
brief
about
vexatiousness,
about
a
defendant
who's
going
to
file
and
file
and
try
to
basically
abuse
the
state
court
system.
first,
we
don't
have
that
in
this
case.
mr.
bennett
filed
only
two
post
conviction
applications.
a
second
440
is
the
one
that's
here
before
this
court,
and
there's
no
question
he
wasn't
trying
to
delay.
right
in
that
second
application
he
cited
2254,
he
wrote
in
the
application
that
i'm
doing
this
to
exhaust.
when
he
didn't
get
a
decision
quickly,
within
a
couple
of
months,
he
actually
wrote
to
the
courts.
he
wrote
to
the
court
and
he
said,
when
am
i
getting
a
decision,
and
he
continued
writing,
and--
mr.
alan
s.
futerfas
--no,
it
did
not,
so
in
terms
of
delay,
mr.
bennett--
mr.
alan
s.
futerfas
--that's
correct,
so
the
delay
here
has
been
a
4-year
delay,
but
the
4
years
is
in
truth
attributable
to
the
state.
once
mr.
bennett
found
out
that
there
was
actually
a
decision,
something
he
didn't
learn
until
a
year
after
the
decision
took
place,
he
immediately,
3
days
later
he
wrote
to
the
court
and
he
said,
please
get
me
written
order
so
that
i
can
at
least
seek
leave
to
appeal.
and
again,
this
is
inconsistent...
consistent
with
this
court's
rule
in
o'sullivan,
which
says,
if
you
want
to
exhaust
you
have
to
try,
at
least
seek
leave
to
appeal
on
these
claims
that
you're
trying
to
exhaust,
and
he
did
so.
he
wrote
to
the
court.
he
wrote
again
and
again.
all
of
1997
was
utilized
by
him
writing
four
or
five
letters
to
the
court
saying,
when
am
i
getting
a
decision.
it
was
only
until
february
of
'98,
after
'97
had
gone,
that
he
finally
went
in
on
2254
and
in
his
habeas
petition
itself...
he
wrote
to
judge
gershon.
in
the
form
it
says,
well,
why
haven't
you
appealed,
and
he
said
because
the
state
hasn't
given
me
the
order,
so
this
case
certainly
is
not
a
question
of
delay.
this
is
a
defendant
who
clearly
did
try
to
exhaust,
and
there's
no
question
here
that
he
complied
with
new
york's
filing
requirements,
filed
his
motion.
the
state
responded,
he
filed
the
reply,
and
the
court
eventually
ruled.
there's
no
question
that
there
wasn't
a
properly
filed
document
here
within
the
meaning
of
new
york
state's
filing
rules.
with
respect,
however,
to
the
vexatiousness
concerns
that
the
petitioners
have
addressed
in
their
brief,
we
think
there
are
a
number
of
answers
to
that.
one
answer
is
that
properly
filed
application
only
permits
tolling.
it
does
not
force
the
states
to
permit
repetitive
filings.
i
don't
think
we
should
be
paternalistic,
and
i
don't
think
we
should
suggest
to
states...
there
may
be
some
states
who
say,
you
know,
we
have
no
problem
with
successive
applications.
we
don't
need
to
amend
our
laws
because
we
have
no
problem
with
them.
there
may
be
other
states,
and
florida
might
be
one,
that
says,
we
have
a
significant
problem.
we're
going
to
amend
our
laws.
we're
going
to
put
strict
statute
of
limitations
in
our
laws,
we're
going
to
limit
the
numbers
of
successive
filings
so--
mr.
alan
s.
futerfas
--very
well.
we
think
there
is
a
difference,
and
we
think
we
have
a
number
of
answers
to
that.
the
first
answer
is
that
congress
was
very
concerned
with
delays
in
capital
cases.
that
wasn't
a
new
concern.
in
1989,
the
chief
justice
appointed
the
powell
commission.
the
powell
commission
assembled,
wrote
a
report
called
the
powell
commission
report.
those
findings
were
embodied
in
very
large
part
in
chapter
154,
so
delays
in
capital
cases
is
something
that
congress
has
been
concerned
about.
they...
a
commission
was...
dealt
with
it,
and
they
recommendations
of
that
commission
were
largely
incorporated
in
chapter
154,
so
with
respect
to
death
penalty
cases,
one
thing
is
for
sure,
congress
said
yes,
we're
concerned
about
it
and
we
have
an
answer,
and
our
answer
is
the
opt
in
provision,
so
if
states
comply
with
the
opt
in
provision,
they
get
the
one
collateral
review,
and
they
have
180
days
to
go
to
federal
court,
with
some
exceptions,
so
that's
clearly...
congress
has
dealt
with
that,
number
1.
number
2,
states
can
always
set
an
execution
date,
and
in
that
regard--
mr.
alan
s.
futerfas
--at
this
point
i'm
not
aware
of
any
that
have
adopted...
opted
in
at
this
point,
but
that
was
congress'...
that
was
congress'
considered
judgment
on
the
issue
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
this
statute,
a
tolling
statute,
should
not
be
judicially
amended
in
order
to
somehow
satisfy
states
that
for
whatever
reason
have
not
adopted
in...
opted
into
the...
to
chapter
154.
in
addition,
this
court's
decision
in
gomez
is
very
important,
because
it
sets
an
incentive
for
defendants.
what
happened
in
gomez,
this
court
may
recall
is,
the
defendant
did
abuse
the
state
court
system
and
started
bringing
last
minute
claims,
new
claims
on
the
eve
of
the
execution,
and
finally
came
before
this
court
and
said,
well,
please
grant
me
a
stay,
and
this
court
in
gomez
said
no.
you've
abused
the
state
court
process,
you've
let
too
much
time
gone
by,
you
haven't
properly
presented
your
claims,
we're
not
going
to
give
you
a
stay.
so
the
gomez
decision
provides
an
enormous
incentive
on
a
capital
defendant
to
use
the
state
court
process
wisely
and
not
abuse
it.
rule
9(a)...
rule
9(a)
of
2254
talks
about
laches.
there
again,
where
a
defendant
abuses
a
state
court
system,
and
the
state
can
come
in
and
say,
you
know,
defendant
abused
the
state
system.
now
we
are
prejudiced
because
so
much
time
has
gone
by.
courts
can
avail
themselves
of
rule
9(a)
and
preclude
a
defendant
from
filing.
we
respectfully
submit
that
problematic
defendants,
defendants
who
are
abusing
state
court
systems,
that's
an
ad
hoc
problem
and
it
can
be
dealt
with
on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
this
court,
even
in
some
of
those
cases
where
clearly
petitioners
maybe
with
mental
problems
that
filed
40
or
50
or
60
applications
with
this
court,
that's
an
ad
hoc
problem,
and
this
court
took
ad
hoc
measures
and
said
with
respect
to
those
defendants
we
will
not
grant
an
in
forma
pauperis
application,
so
there
are
many
measures--
mr.
alan
s.
futerfas
--the...
i
think
there
is
a
theoretical
possibility
of
a
defendant
filing
repetitive
applications
for
whatever
reason
to
toll
the
time
that
the
defendant
has
to
go
into
federal
court.
i
think
that
clearly
is
a
theoretical
possibility.
in
practical
effect,
practical
effect
i
think
most
defendants
who
are
noncapital
defendants
are
going
to
have
an
incentive
to
get
their
claims
dealt
with
promptly,
number
1.
number
2,
if
that
happens,
the
state
can...
state
judge
can
simply
send
an
order
to
the
clerk's
office,
do
not
accept
this
defendant's
applications
either
without
leave
of
court,
or
simply
don't
accept
them
any
more.
in
death
penalty
cases,
a
state
can
say,
we've
had
enough
of
this,
we're
setting
an
execution
date,
and
that
will
force
the
defendant
to
go
straight
to
federal
court,
so
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
ways
to
deal
with
the
vexatious
litigant.
and
also,
keep
in
mind
that
even
though
tolling
occurs,
that
during
the
periods
of
time
that
there
is
no
tolling,
that
the
clock
is
running,
so
if
defendant
files
an
application
and
the
application
is
denied,
and
then
a
month
later
files
another
one,
or
2
months
later,
that
time
is
going
to
toll,
but
i
think
these
are
ad
hoc
problems,
and
that
state
courts
are
certainly
well
equipped.
if
a
state
determines
that
there
is
a
general,
more
general
delay
problem
the
state,
under
our
version
of
the
rule,
has
absolute
freedom
to
adopt
any
kind
of
procedure
the
state
wishes
to
do,
whether
it's
timing
requirements
or
successiveness
limitations.
in
fact,
2244(b)(3)
is
a
wonderful
model
that
states
could
follow.
they
could
set
up
a
system
where,
under
successive
application,
the
state
prisoner
must
obtain
judicial
review
first,
or
approval
first
to
file,
so
there
is
a
whole
panoply,
really,
of
options
available
to
a
state
to
deal
with
these
problems.
one
concern
that
we
suggest
occurs
with
respect,
however,
to
the
interplay
between
153
and
154
is
the
following
hypothetical.
if
a
state
opts
in,
in
a
death
penalty
case,
the
state
opts
in,
the
defendant
gets
an
attorney,
a
competent
attorney,
the
defendant
gets
one
run
through
of
the
state
collateral
review
process,
and
there's
no
question
that
they
can
bring
up
any
claim
they
want,
there's
no
suggestion
in
the
state's
briefs
that
they're
limited
on
what
kinds
of
claims
they
can
bring
up
in
that
one
review
process,
be
it
procedurally
barred
claims
or
otherwise,
when
that
petition
is
disposed
of,
they
have
180
days
to
get
into
federal
court.
now
watch
what
could
happen
with
a
death
penalty
defendant
if
the
state's
rule
is
adopted,
because
under
153,
the
death
penalty
defendant
now
is
convicted,
files
a
post
application,
post
conviction
application,
does...
may
or
may
not
have
a
lawyer,
because
the
state
has
not
opted
in,
and
it
turns
out
all
of
the
claims
in
the
post
conviction
application
are
procedurally
barred
and
more
than
1
year
has
gone
by.
the
defendant,
who
is
not
represented
because
the
state
has
not
opted
in,
now
has
lost
his
or
her
right
to
even
get
into
federal
court
on
a
habeas,
so
that's
a
possibility
with
the
state's
view
of
the
rule.
if
i
may
just
have
a
moment.
the
other
cases
that
we
respectfully
suggest
the
state's
rule
conflicts
with
are
this
court's
decision
in
rose
v.
lundy.
rose
said
that
an
application,
the
mixed
application
should
be
dismissed.
the
state
suggests,
well,
we
can
kind
of
modify
rose
v.
lundy
and
say
that
the
application
will
be
held
in
abeyance,
but
rose
v.
lundy
says
no,
it
should
be
dismissed.
of
course,
if
the
application
is
dismissed,
and
1
year
passes,
that
defendant
could
be
deprived
of
going
into
federal
court.
the
o'sullivan
decision
was
just
decided
a
year
ago
says
the
defendants
must
bring
all
their
claims...
must
seek
leave
to
bring
their
claims
to
the
highest
court
in
the
state.
there
again,
this
is
exactly,
actually,
this
case,
tony
bennett's
case,
is
o'sullivan,
because
here
tony
bennett
is,
having
lost
in
the
trial
court,
now
is
trying
to
seek
leave
to
the
appellate
division,
second
department,
hasn't
received
the
order
for
4
years
in
which
to
do
so,
so
he's
trying
to
comply
with
o'sullivan.
but
meanwhile,
the
clock
is
running,
and
under
the
state's
rule...
well,
because
the
trial
court
determined
that
his
claims
are
procedurally
barred,
he's
already
lost
his
right
to
get
into
federal
court,
even
though
at
the
same
time
o'sullivan
says
you
must
be
trying
to
seek
leave
and
appeal
your
petitions
in
order
to
exhaust,
so
there's
a
conflict
there
as
well.
finally,
this
court's
decision
in
lonchar
v.
thomas,
this
court
said
that
dismissal
of
the
first
habeas
corpus
is
a
very
serious
matter,
and
any
rule
that
would
deprive
a
first
habeas
corpus
application
should
be
clear
and
fair.
there's
no
limitation
in
2244(d)(2)
as
to
first
habeases
or
second
habeases,
or
first
post
conviction
applications
or
second
post
conviction
applications,
so
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
state's
rule
is
inconsistent
as
well
with
this
court's
considered
judgment
and
pronouncements
in
lonchar
v.
thomas.
and
if
no
justices
have
any
further
questions,
i
will
submit.
mr.
alan
s.
futerfas
thank
you.
