justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
is
your
definition
of
properly
filed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
that
the
third
part
of
your
test,
or
the
second
part
of
your--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
essentially
usurps
the
function,
or
at
least
duplicates
the
function
of
the
state
court
and
is,
it
seems
to
me,
contrary
to
the
federal
interests
that
underlie
this
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
rule,
what
would
happen
if
there
were
some
petition...
some
claims
that
were
procedurally
barred
and
some
that
were
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
many
states
have
opted
in?
