so
then
the
federal
court
would
have
to
determine
not
only
if
there
is
a
procedural
bar,
but
what
exceptions
exist,
and
whether
this
particular
case
fits
within
that
exception,
like
statute
of
limitations
often
have
tolling
accoutrements,
so
you're
getting
the
federal
court
involved
in
a
lot
of
up
front
decisonmaking
that
substitutes
for
the
state,
and
my
question
is
i
think
the
same
as
justice
kennedy's.
that
is,
you're
asking
the
federal
court,
as
it
does
in
the
erie
area,
to
make
a
determination
of
what
state
law
is.
isn't
it
more
respectful
of
the
states
to
say,
state...
state
court,
this
is
for
you
to
decide.
we
don't
know
how
to
apply
your
procedural
bar
rule.
we'd
rather
have
you
tell
us,
does
this
fall
within
an
exception?
it
seems
to
me
that
ordering
the
federal
court
to
decide
the
state
law
question
is
not
as
respectful
of
the
states
as
it
would
be
to
say,
that's
a
question
that
the
state
courts
should
decide.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
here
we
don't
know,
because
the
state
order
is
opaque.
it
doesn't
tell
us.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
question
is
what
properly
filed
meant,
and
one
thing
to
say,
we
look
to
state
law
to
see
if
this
is
an
application
for
whatever,
and
we
look
to
see
that
it
is,
in
fact,
filed
in
the
court,
the
stamp
and
everything,
there
it
is
in
the
properly
filed,
in
the
right
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
those
mechanical
things
are
easy
for
a
federal
court
to
check,
but
going
beyond
that,
this
is
a
rather
complex
operation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
schweitzer,
you
have
conceded,
i
think,
in
agreement
with
mr.
castellano,
that
congress
could
have
been,
as
he
put
it
in
his
brief,
more
specific
in
defining
the
scope
of
the
tolling
provision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
say
that...
well,
mr.
castellano
says
the
reason
probably
that
congress
was
not
more
specific,
that
1)
it's
members
couldn't
agree
on
a
definition,
or
because
the
types
of
state
procedures
that
could
be
invoked
were
so
varied,
congress
thought
it
best
to
leave
the
application
of
the
provision
for
the
courts,
but
that
seems...
why
shouldn't
the
court
say,
well,
congress,
we'll
just
go
as
far
as
you
did.
you
were
ambiguous
about
this.
you
left
room
for
one
interpretation
or
the
other.
we're
going
to
pick
the
one
that
favors
the
petitioner.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it's
not
one
or
the
other,
because
everyone
would
agree
that
at
least
it's
got
to
be
an
application
for
habeas
corpus,
and
has
got
to
be
filed
in
the
court,
so
it's
not...
it's...
that's...
no
question
about
it.
the
question
is
whether
there
is
something
more
than
that,
and
i'm
asking
why
the
federal
court
should
read
something
into
the
statute
that
congress
didn't
clearly
put
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
if
the
states,
as
justice
o'connor
suggested,
enacts
one
of
these...
you
have
to
get
permission
before
you
can
file
such
an
application.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
a
question
about
the
operation
of
the
state
procedural
bar
in
this
scenario?
let's
assume
that
as
your
opponent
suggests,
that
there
is,
in
fact,
a
state
procedural
bar
in
this
case,
and
let's
assume
that
you're
right
that
that
doesn't
factor
into
this
1-year
statute
of
limitations
determination
by
the
federal
court.
then
what
impact,
if
any,
would
the
state
procedural
bar
have
on
the
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
other
words,
there
is
a
state...
the
state
will
not
hear
this
case
because
its
court
will
determine
there's
a
procedural
bar.
let's
say
that
mr.
castellano
is
right
about
that,
what
a
state
court
would
do
in
this
very
case,
but
that
you
are
right
that
that
kind
of
complex
determination
should
not
be
made
by
the
federal
court,
so
the
federal
court
just
checks
to
see
that
it
is
an
application,
and
that
it
has
indeed
been
filed
in
the
right
court.
what
impact,
if
any,
does
the
state
rule
that
this
claim
is
procedurally
barred
in
state
court
have
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yeah--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i'm
accepting
both
their
position
that
this
is,
in
fact,
procedurally
barred
in
the
state,
your
position
that
that
doesn't...
you
don't
get
into
that
on
the
statute
of
limitations
question.
i'm
asking
you
then,
when
there's
no
time
bar
in
the
federal
court,
what
effect,
if
any,
does
the
state
rule
that
this
claim
would
be
procedurally
barred
in
state
court,
have
on
the
federal
habeas
proceeding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes--
