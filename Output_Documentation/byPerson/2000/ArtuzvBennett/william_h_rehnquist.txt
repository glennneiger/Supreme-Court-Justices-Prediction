chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
99-1238,
christopher
artuz
v.
tony
bruce
bennett.
mr.
castellano.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
it
all
comes
up
because
we're
construing
the
language,
properly
filed,
in
the
applicable
statutory
provision.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
gets
you
to
the
situation
where
the
petition
is
filed
in
a
court
that
didn't
even
have
the
authority
to
grant
any
sort
of
relief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
want
to
go
further
than
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let's
back
up
just
a
minute,
mr....
i
suppose
you'd
be
on
stronger
ground
if
you're
talking
not
about
a
procedural
bar
to
the
merits
in
the
sense
of
plain
statement,
that
sort
of
thing.
supposing
you
just
have
a
failure
to
file
within
the
time
limit
provided
by
the
state.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
you
believe
that
in
order
to
be
properly
filed
the
thing
must
be
timely.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
perhaps
in
a
pleading
sense,
in
the
new
york
courts,
a
statute
of
limitations,
if
it
isn't
pleaded
by
the
defendant,
might
be
waived.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
federal
court
is
always
going
to
have
to
decide,
when
this
question
comes
up,
whether
or
not
the
state
petition
was,
quote,
properly
filed.
i
mean,
that
was
congress'
choice.
i
mean,
it
isn't
necessarily
any
court's
choice.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
don't
have
to
take
either
all
one
or
all
the
other.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
castellano.
mr.
schweitzer,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schweitzer.
mr.
futerfas.
am
i
pronouncing
your
name
correctly?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
think
the
term
properly
filed
means,
mr.
futerfas?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
your
position.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing,
to
use
mr.
castellano's
example,
there's
a
habeas
corpus
petition
that
is
delivered
to
the
clerk
of
a
surrogate's
court
which
has
only
probate
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
also,
a
timely
filing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
quarrel
then,
really,
with
the
petitioner
is
on
the
procedural
bar
type
of
thing,
where
it's
uncertain
whether
this
can
be
raised.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
significance
of
the
procedural...
of
the
bar
decision
in
state
court
is
that
you
have
to
show
cause
in
prejudice
when
you
come
into
federal
court
before
those
claims
could
be
reached,
don't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
perhaps
my
question...
i
think
justice
ginsburg
asked,
you
know,
then
what
is
the
state
court
determination
that
a
claim
is
procedurally
barred
reduced
to
if
it
doesn't
have
any
effect
of
tolling.
well,
it
still
has
an
effect
on
the
federal
court's
ability
to
review
the
merits
of
the
claim,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
unless
the
person
can
show
cause
in
prejudice
the
federal
court
can't
reach
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
futerfas.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
castellano,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
castellano.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
99-1238,
artuz
versus
bennett
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
