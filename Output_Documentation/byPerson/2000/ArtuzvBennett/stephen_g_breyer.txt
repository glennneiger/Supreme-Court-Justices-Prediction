justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
we
go
beyond
the
mechanical,
mechanical
things
are
easy
to
check,
but
once
you
get
beyond
the
mechanical,
you
both
have
the
federal
courts
interpreting
state
law
later,
and
it
seems
to
me
something
worse.
any
reasonable
defendant
who
has
a
lawyer,
certainly,
who
has
any
kind
of
complicated
state
issue,
will
know
that
he
better
file
a
protective
habeas
petition
in
federal
court.
now,
what's
the
federal
judge
supposed
to
do
when
he
gets
that
habeas
petition--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--prior
to
the
state
court
deciding
the
issue,
and
that's
going
to
happen
all
over
the
place.
he
now
has
to
decide
questions
of
state
law
which
the
state
court
might
later
say
he's
wrong
about
or
risk
dismissing
it,
or
avoid
the
exhaustion
problem.
it
sounds
like
a
real
mess
as
soon
as
you
depart
from
the
mechanical.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
case
where
it
just
isn't
clear?
i
mean,
the
easy
cases
can
sort
themselves
out
under
either
interpretation,
i
think,
but
what
about
the
cases
which
are
tougher?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
a
difficult...
you
know--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--frivolous
cases
aren't
really
that
tough.
i
mean,
we
deal
with
them.
but
the
cases
that
might...
may
have
some
merit,
and
you're
not
sure,
and
the
state
law's
uncertain,
those
are
the
ones
that
take
the
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
no
problem,
if
the
federal
court
sees
somebody
abusing
the
state
system
this
is
an
equitable
statute,
tolling,
and
they
can
deal
with
it.
but
i'm
worried
about
the
complicated,
close
cases.
what
happens
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
goes
back,
and
now
the
state
court
says,
oh,
well,
i
guess,
in
fact,
there's
a
independent
state
ground,
or
the
statute
of
limitations
wasn't
tolled
under
state
law,
et
cetera.
now
what
happens?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
could
you,
under
your
interpretation?
it's
more
than
a
year.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even
though
it
turns
out
that,
in
fact,
it's
not...
even
though
it
was
in
the
wrong
court,
it
should
have
gone
to
the
surrogate
court,
or
something?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
was
wrong.
it
was
wrong
under
state--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
federal
court
was
wrong.
it
was
a
close
question.
