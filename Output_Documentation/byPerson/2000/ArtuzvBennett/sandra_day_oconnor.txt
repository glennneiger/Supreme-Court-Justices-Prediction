o'connor
well,
the
courts
are
all
over
the
lot
on
what
the
words,
properly
filed,
mean.
it
seems
to
me
there
are
several
different
approaches.
maybe
just
properly
filed
in
the
sense
of
being
timely
and
in
the
proper
place,
or
maybe
getting
permission
from
the
state,
a
certificate
of
appealability
if
the
state
requires
it,
that
kind
of
thing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
not
every
lower
court
has
thought
that
it
also
encompasses
a
review
of
substance
to
see
whether
it's
procedurally
barred.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
guess
the
court
has
to
later
decide
whether
it's
procedurally
barred.
the
state
court
presumably
would
reach
that
question,
or
the
federal
court,
in
due
course,
wouldn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
federal
habeas
court
would,
i
suppose,
at
the
end
of
the
day
have
to
address
that
issue.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
if...
i
suppose
that
a
state
could
have
its
own
state
rule
for
second
or
successive
petitions
in
state
court
for
post
conviction
relief,
such
as
a
requirement
that
the
applicant
get
a
certificate
from
some
reviewing
court
as
a
prerequisite
to
filing
the
successive
petition,
and
if
there
were
that
kind
of
mechanical
requirement,
just
like
the
requirement
for
a
filing
fee,
or
filing
in
a
certain
court
or
within
a
certain
time,
all
those
things
are
in
the
nature
of
kind
of
mechanical
rules,
so
the
state
can
certainly
protect
itself,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
it's
open
to
a
state
to
do
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
there's
no
reason
why
we
have
to
construct
something
to
save
the
state
that
the
state
can
take
care
of
on
its
own.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
does
have
a
meaningful
effect
in
the
sense
of
looking
to
any
state
requirements
for
timing,
place,
et
cetera.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
we
should
expand
it
slightly,
but
not
to
include
a
procedural
bar
and
substantive
law
component.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
a
state
requirement
for
a
successive
position,
petition
that
there
be
some...
something
akin
to
a
certificate
of
appealability?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--did
the
state
court
here
ever
issue
a
written
order?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
this
date
we
have
no
written
order
from
the
state
court?
