mr.
john
m.
castellano
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
whether
a
state
prisoner
can
extend
the
1-year
limitations
period
for
federal
habeas
corpus
petitions
by
filing
repetitive
motions
in
state
court
that
are
procedurally
barred
from
review
under
state
law.
there
are
at
least
three
reasons
why
these
motions
should
not
be
afforded
tolling.
mr.
john
m.
castellano
absolutely,
your
honor,
yes.
these
state
post
conviction
motions,
your
honor,
cause
unnecessary
delays
from
repetitive
litigation
that
advance
no
purpose
of
the
tolling
provision.
they
provide
state
prisoners
with
a
simple
expedient
to
defeat
the
statute
of
limitations
at
will,
and
allowing
tolling
for
such
motions
undermines
core
principles
of
comity
and
federalism.
they're
at
the
heart
of
this
court's
habeas
corpus
jurisprudence,
and
at
the
core
of
the
aedpa.
the
statutory
language
supports
the
position
of
the
states
here.
under
a
plain
reading
of
the
statutory
language
the
words,
properly
filed,
must
mean
something
more
than
simply
filed.
mr.
john
m.
castellano
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
castellano
yes,
that's
right,
your
honor.
there
are
many--
mr.
john
m.
castellano
--yes.
mr.
john
m.
castellano
yes,
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
castellano
here
there
are
several
different
definitions.
even
among
the
cases
upon
which
the
respondent
relies,
and
that
demonstrates,
if
anything,
that
there
is
some
ambiguity
in
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
word
properly
is
not
easily
susceptible
of
definition.
here--
mr.
john
m.
castellano
--it's
this,
your
honor.
there's
really
a
three
step
analysis,
if
you
will.
the
first
step
is
this.
properly
filed
must
mean
something
more
than
filed,
in
addition
to
the
ordinary
rules
of
statutory
construction,
which
would
so
indicate.
in
addition,
here
congress
used
the
word
filed
24
times
in
the
habeas
corpus
statute
but
modified
it
with
the
word
properly
only
once,
so
it
must
have
meant
that
the
words
properly
filed
had
something
more
than
an
inconsequential
or
nominal
meaning.
second,
there's
a
plain
sense,
plain
common
sense
reading
of
the
words,
properly
filed,
under
which
a
document,
to
be
properly
filed,
has
to
be
filed
in
the
right
place,
in
the
right
court,
and
even
some
of
the
cases
upon
which
the
respondent
relies
so
indicated.
mr.
john
m.
castellano
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
castellano
yes,
your
honor.
we
say
that
here
this
court
did
not
have
the
authority
to
grant
the
relief
requested
because
there
was
an
absolute
mandatory
state
procedural
bar
in
the
way.
mr.
john
m.
castellano
that's
the
second
part
of
the
test.
the
third
part
of
the
test
is
that
a...
is
a
plain
common
sense
understanding
of
the
words,
right
place,
or
right
court,
under
which
a
document
can't
be
filed
in
the
right
court
if
it's
filed
in
a
court
that
can't
entertain
the
merits
of
it.
that's
really
the
third--
mr.
john
m.
castellano
--no,
your
honor,
the
third
prong
is
not
a
jurisdictional
prong.
it's
simply
a
prong
that
says
that
if
the
state
court
can't,
under
the
state's
procedural
rules,
adjudicate
the
merits,
then
that
motion
is
not
properly
filed
in
that
state
court.
mr.
john
m.
castellano
it's
not
properly
filed
if
it
can't
adjudicate
the
merits.
mr.
john
m.
castellano
not
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
your
honor,
these
are
absolute
mandatory
bars,
and
there's
no
indication
that
if
the
state
waives
these
bars,
that
the
court
has
the
authority
to
examine
these
issues--
mr.
john
m.
castellano
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
we
are
imposing
an
additional
bar.
i
wouldn't
use
the
sense
jurisdictional.
i
would
use
mandatory
state
procedural
bar
which,
under
the
procedural
default
doctrine,
is
a
concept
that
the
federal
courts
are
very
familiar
with.
this
court
in
teague
v.
lane,
for
example,
did
the
type
of
analysis
that
we're
advancing
here.
in
other
words,
it
decided
whether
or
not
to
send
a
state
prisoner
back
to
state
court
in
order
to
pursue
a
state
remedy,
or,
on
the
other
hand,
whether
that
state
remedy
is
no
longer
available--
mr.
john
m.
castellano
--i
don't
believe
it
duplicates
the
function
of
the
state
courts
at
all.
i
believe
that
simply
it
shows
respect
to
the
state
court
procedural
rules
and
respect
to
the
individual
state
court
decisions
that
have
been--
mr.
john
m.
castellano
--actually,
your
honor,
what
the
court
could
do
is
to
adopt
the
harris
v.
reid
plain
statement
rule,
and
the
coleman
exception
to
the
harris
v.
reid
plain
statement
rule
and
in
this...
so
that
ordinarily
there
would
be
a
plain
statement
on
behalf
of
the
state
court
applying
the
particular
state
procedural
bar
in
that
individual
case.
mr.
john
m.
castellano
yes,
your
honor,
that's--
mr.
john
m.
castellano
--yes,
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
castellano
right,
your
honor.
in
new
york
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
for
post
conviction
review,
but
certainly
in
many
states,
such
as
florida,
which
is
represented
here,
there's
a
statute
of
limitations
that
does
have
exceptions
to
it,
and
as
to
which
there
should
be
some
judicial
review
with
regard
to
the
application
of
that
particular--
mr.
john
m.
castellano
--well,
your
honor,
in
the
ordinary
case
the
state
court
will
have
already
decided
that
very
particular
issue
and
applied
that
procedural
bar
to
the
very
case
that's
now
in
front
of
the--
mr.
john
m.
castellano
--i
think
the
application
here
is
a
little
bit
different.
if
you
apply,
for
example,
the
harris
v.
reid
plain
statement
rule,
and
the
coleman
exception
to
it,
we
fall
within
that,
so
for
example,
under
coleman
this
court
held
that
there
was
no
need
to...
there
was
no
need
to
have
a
plain
statement,
because
from
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
it
didn't
fairly
appear
that
the
state
court
decision
was
based
primarily
on
federal
law
or
interwoven
with
federal
law.
that's
exactly
the
situation
that
we
have
here
as
well.
mr.
john
m.
castellano
yes,
absolutely,
your
honor,
and
it's
the
exact
same
interpretation.
mr.
john
m.
castellano
the
problem
with
reducing
the
word
properly
to
such
a
limited
view,
to
a
view
that
just
says,
rudimentary
filing
requirements,
is
in
part
this.
that
means
that
a
document
that
satisfies
service
and
notice
requirements
only,
but
is
filed
in,
for
example,
a
surrogate's
court,
or
a
court
that's...
can't
possibly
decide
the
claim,
might
be
included.
mr.
john
m.
castellano
yes,
your
honor,
the
state
can
protect
itself.
the
problem
with
that
is
this.
there
are
only
very
few
states
that
enacted
their
post
conviction
review
schemes
in
terms
of
prefiling
review,
and
it
would
mean--
mr.
john
m.
castellano
--it's
open
to
a
state
to--
mr.
john
m.
castellano
--but
it
would
be
to
assume
that
congress
meant
that
it's
statute
would
not
have
any
real
or
meaningful
effect
in
all
of
those
states
in
which
there
was
no
prefiling
review,
and
that
it
would
be--
mr.
john
m.
castellano
--except
that
that
view,
the
respondent's
view
and
the
second
circuit's
view
here
doesn't
look
to
all
of
the
procedural
rules.
it
looks
to
a
very
small
subset.
mr.
john
m.
castellano
absolutely,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
john
m.
castellano
that--
mr.
john
m.
castellano
--no,
not
at
all,
your
honor,
because
that's
the
same
position
that
that
federal
court
is
in
if
it's
deciding
whether
to
send
that
petitioner
back
to
state
court
to
exhaust
his
state
remedies.
we
say,
make
that
exact
same
determination.
in
other
words,
when
it
comes
to
federal
court,
you
make
that
rose
v.
lundy
determination.
are
you
going
to
send
that
petitioner
back
to
state
court,
or
are
you
going
to
presume
that
there's
a
state
court
procedural
bar
that's
in
the
way,
that
renders
that
remedy
no
longer
available.
make
that
determination,
and
that's
a
determination
that's
made
regularly
by
the
second
circuit
with
regard
to
the
very
same
procedural
rules
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case,
and
made
regularly
with
regard...
with...
by
the
federal
circuit
courts
in
new
york
with
regard
to
the
very
same
procedural
rules
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
john
m.
castellano
your
honor--
mr.
john
m.
castellano
--there's
more
than
one
alternative.
one
of
the
reasonable
alternatives
would
just
be
to
dismiss
the
case
under
rose
v.
lundy
to
allow
the
exhaustion
to
take
place.
mr.
john
m.
castellano
the
statute
of
limitations
is
a
timing
device,
separate
from
the
procedural
bar.
in
other
words--
mr.
john
m.
castellano
--the
procedural
bar
goes
to
individual
claims.
the
statute
of
limitations
goes
to
the--
mr.
john
m.
castellano
--you
need...
well,
you
need
the
statute
of
limitations
for
other
types
of
cases.
mr.
john
m.
castellano
no--
mr.
john
m.
castellano
--under
our
position,
that
petitioner
would
receive
exhaustion,
and
to
go
back
to
justice
stevens'
example,
the
court
should
dismiss
that,
or
could,
at
least,
dismiss
that
claim
under
rose
v.
lundy
and
during
that
period
of
time,
that
period
of
time
in
which
the
state...
in
which
the
state
prisoner
was
exhausting
state
remedies,
he
should
receive
tolling
if
this
was
a
proper
dismissal
under
rose
v.
lundy.
that
should
be
an
automatic
result
of
the
dismissal
under
rose
v.
lundy,
is
to
allow
the
tolling
for
the
petitioner.
mr.
john
m.
castellano
you
need
the
statute
of
limitations
because
that
petitioner,
first
of
all
shouldn't
be...
that
petitioner,
if
he
knows
beforehand
that
those
claims
are
procedurally
barred,
of
course,
shouldn't
be--
mr.
john
m.
castellano
--right.
mr.
john
m.
castellano
well,
you
need
the
statute
of
limitations
for
one
thing
to
keep
that...
to
encourage,
not
just
that
petitioner,
but
other
petitioners
who
don't
have
to
go
through
that
process
of
14
months
of
litigation
into
federal
court
more
quickly.
mr.
john
m.
castellano
i'm
sorry,
justice--
mr.
john
m.
castellano
--not
at
all,
your
honor.
that...
this
interpretation
follows
the
exhaustion
rule
to
a
tee.
it
says
that
if
you
would
send
this
case
back
to
state
court
for
exhaustion
purposes,
then
this
petitioner
receives
tolling.
if
you
wouldn't
receive...
if
you
wouldn't
send
it
back
for
exhaustion
purposes,
then
you
don't
receive
tolling.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
m.
castellano
your
honor,
i
would
just
like
to
address
the
question,
i
believe
it
was
justice
ginsburg's
question
actually
about
why
adopt
our
rule.
if
there
are
many
different
applications
of
the
words,
properly
filed,
there
are
many
different
reasonable
interpretations
of
the
words
properly
filed,
why
ours?
why
not
just
the
petitioner's?
ours
because
the
purpose
of
a
statute
of...
the
purpose
of
a
tolling
provision
is
exhaustion,
and
our
rule
follows
the
purpose
of
the
tolling
provision
to
a
tee.
it
follows
it
much
more
closely,
certainly,
than
the
respondent's.
exhaustion
does
not
require
a
state
prisoner
to
return
to
state
court
to
exhaust
a
remedy
that's
no
longer
available
under
state
law
because
it's
procedurally
barred.
the
respondent
also
mentions
the
workload
costs.
if
the
court
views
the
workload
costs,
it
should
view
them
as
a
whole.
the
states
are
saving
much
in
the
way
of
workload
here,
and
the
federal
courts,
for
example,
are
pushing
most
of
these
defendants
forward.
these
are
defendants
who
would
in
any
event
file
in
federal
court,
but
much
later,
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
of
limitations
is
being
affected
by
drawing
closer
that
period
of
time
between
final...
between
direct
review
and
federal
review.
and
finally,
as
to
time
bars,
the
danger
with
requiring
the
states
to
enact
time
bars--
