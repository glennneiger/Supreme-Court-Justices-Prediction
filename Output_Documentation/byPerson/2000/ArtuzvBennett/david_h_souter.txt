--well,
but
does
it
follow
that
the
court
can't
entertain
the
merits?
i
mean,
a
procedural
bar
is
something
that
can
be
waived
and,
as
counterintuitive
as
it
may
be,
i
mean,
we
occasionally
do
get
cases
before
this
court
in
which
there
seems
to
have
been
a
procedural
bar
that
the
state
didn't
invoke,
so
it
seems
to
me
that
we're
not
in
the
position
of
even
being
able
to
analyze
this
on
a
merely...
or
i
shouldn't
say
merely,
on
a
jurisdictional
basis,
because
it
really
doesn't
go
to
the
state
court's
jurisdiction.
it
goes
to
the
discretionary
decision
by
the
state
prosecutor
to
invoke
the
bar,
and
so
i
don't
think
we
can
do
it
on
the
third
prong
that
you
mentioned,
which
i
understood
was
in
a
sense
in
effect
a
jurisdictional
prong.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean,
if
it
can't
adjudicate
the
merits
it's
not
properly
filed.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
it
can
adjudicate
the
merits.
it
can
adjudicate
the
merits
if
the
state
doesn't
invoke
the
bar.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
doesn't
this...
doesn't
your
answer,
and
i
realize
i'm
shifting
my
position
here,
but
doesn't
your
answer
point
out
another
difficulty
of
your
position,
and
that
is,
a
federal
court
is,
it
seems
to
me,
hard
pressed
in
these
cases
if
it's
got
to
decide
whether
a
particular
bar
is
jurisdictional
or
whether
it's
not
jurisdictional
under
state
law,
and
this
is
just
adding
one
more
complication,
as
against
the
position
of
the
other
side,
which
takes
a
kind
of
a
plain
language,
almost
physical
act
interpretation.
you're
putting
yet
another
burden
on
the
state
court
to
decide
whether
a
bar
is
jurisdictional
or
not,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
counts
against
adopting
your
interpretation.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there's
no
question
that
the
federal
courts
in
a
sense
can
do
this.
sometimes
the
federal
courts
have
to
do
it,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
does
count
against
your
position
that
a
federal
court
will
have
to
go
through
this
every
time
a
state
court
issues
a
laconic
one
word
order,
denied.
