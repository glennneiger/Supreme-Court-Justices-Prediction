--well,
presumably
the
state
court
made
that
determination
when
it
made
the
underlying
order,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
really
contrary
to
the
federalism

that

the
basis
of
the
statute.
you're
asking
the
federal
courts
to
make
a
determination
which
brushes
up
against
the
merits,
just
in
order
to
determine
the
tolling
provision.

so
what?
unknown
speaker
and
in
the
correct
court
that
would
have
the
authority
to
grant
relief?

if
a
state

and
a
petitioner
wishes
to
simply
continue
the
tolling
period
he
can
make
repeated
filings
in
the
state
and
if
a
district
judge
prefers
not
to
hear
the
habeas
petition
he
can
just
simply
wait.
