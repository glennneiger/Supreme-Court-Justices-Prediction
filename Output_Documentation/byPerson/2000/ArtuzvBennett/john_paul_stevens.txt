justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i'm--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
puzzled.
there's
litigation
in
the
state
court
over
whether
or
not
a
procedural
bar
exists.
while
that
litigation
goes
on,
what
is
a
federal
judge
supposed
to
do,
decide
the
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
say
the
remedy
hasn't
been
exhausted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
and
then
it
takes
more
than
a
year
to
resolve
the
procedural
bar
issue
in
the
state
court,
and
eventually
you
end
up
saying
you're
procedurally
barred.
why
do
you
need
the
statute
of
limitation,
then?
why
don't
you
just
rely
on
the
procedural
bar?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
whether
the
statute
has
run
or
not
depends
on
whether
or
not
the
case
was
procedurally
barred,
and
if
it
was
procedurally
barred,
why
do
you
need
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
but
you
find
in
the
state
all
the
claims
were
procedurally
barred,
otherwise
the
statute
would
not
have
run,
and
if
they
find
that,
why
do
you
need
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
are
not
procedurally
barred.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
then
i'm
asking
you,
at
the
end
of
this
14-month
litigation
in
the
state
procedure
the
state
court
ends
up
saying,
all
the
claims
are
procedurally
barred.
why
do
you
need
a
statute
of
limitations
if
that's
the
holding
of
the
state
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
assuming
he
doesn't
know
until
the
14
months
of
litigation
in
the
state
court
have
resolved
the
issue,
and
there
are
lots
of
times--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it's
a
contested
matter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
all
have
to
go
through
that
process
if
the
state's
going
to
plead
a
procedural
bar.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
really
think
there's
tension
between
the
exhaustion
rule
and
your
interpretation
of
properly
filed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
schweitzer,
does
florida
have
either
a
statute
of
limitations
or
any
rules
taking
care
of
the
repetitive
and
successive
filing
problem
as
a
matter
of
state
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
counsel,
the
states
draw
a
distinction
between
noncapital
cases
and
capital
cases.
it's
always
in
the
petitioner's
interest
to
get
prompt
disposition
when
he's
not...
in
a
nondeath
case.
in
a
death
case,
the
stakes
are
reversed,
and
there
is
a
motive...
a
potential
for
repetitive
filing
just
to
delay
the
execution,
so
maybe
you
should
address
the
capital
cases,
too.
