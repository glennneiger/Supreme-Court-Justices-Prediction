justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
she's
referring
to
1732,
which
says,
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law,
and
then
jumping
to
the
end
of
it,
and
suit
on
the
contract
that
is
against
the
awarding
for
alleged
breach
thereof
and
not
making
the
payment
is
the
exclusive
remedy
of
the
contractor
or
his
or
her
assignees,
and
you
say
that
means
him,
with
reference
to
those
wages
or
penalties.
