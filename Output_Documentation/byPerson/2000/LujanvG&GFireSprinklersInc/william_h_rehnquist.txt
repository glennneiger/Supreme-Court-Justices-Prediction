lujan
versus
g&g
fire
sprinklers,
inc.
the
california
labor
code
authorizes
the
state
to
withhold
payments
due
to
a
contractor
on
a
public
works
project
if
a
subcontractor
on
that
project
fails
to
comply
with
certain
prevailing
wage
requirements
of
the
code,
and
it
permits
the
contractor
in
turn
to
withhold
the
similar
sums
from
the
sub.
respondent
g&g,
a
fire
protection
company,
has
served
as
a
sub
on
several
california
public
works
projects,
payments
was
withheld
from
it,
pursuant
to
the
statutory
plan.
g&g
sued
the
petitioners,
various
state
officials
and
state
agencies
under
section
1983,
claiming
that
the
withholding
of
payments
without
a
hearing
deprived
g&g
of
property,
without
due
process
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
district
court
agreed,
declared
the
relevant
code
provisions
unconstitutional.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse.
we
assume
without
deciding
that
payments
were
withheld
from
respondent
under
color
of
state
law,
and
the
respondent
has
a
property
interest
in
its
claim
for
payment
under
its
contract,
but
we
conclude
that
because
california
law
affords
g&g
sufficient
opportunity
to
pursue
its
claim
in
state
court,
the
labor
code
does
not
deprived
of
its
claim
with
due
process
of
law.
in
cases
involving
deprivation
of
present
entitlements,
such
as
the
right
of
ownership
in
property,
the
right
to
pursue
a
gainful
occupation,
we
have
held
the
due
process
requires
a
reasonably
prompt
hearing.
the
g&g
has
no
present
entitlement,
it
has
only
a
claim
that
it
complied
with
the
terms
of
its
contracts
and
therefore
it
has
entitled
to
be
paid
in
full.
g&gâ€™s
interest
in
its
claim
can
be
fully
protected
by
an
ordinary
breach
of
contract
suit.
we
believe
that
such
a
suit
is
available
to
it
either
under
the
california
labor
code
or
state
common
law.
we
therefore
hold
that
the
relevant
provisions
of
the
code
do
not
deprive
respondent
of
property
without
due
process
of
law.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
