mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--your
honor,
my...
there
had
been
this...
notices
to
withhold
issued
on
a
number
of
projects,
as
prime
contractor
and
subcontractor
to
g
&
g,
and
what
g
&
g
did
is,
filed
lawsuits
under
the
labor
code
to
seek
recovery
of
its
money,
and
prosecuted
those
lawsuits.
in
the
declaration--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--yes,
and
in
fact
in
the
declaration
by
dlse
in
the
district
court
the...
that
they
put
into
evidence,
their
counsel
talks
about
one
of
the
cases
that
he
litigated.
in
fact,
the
depositions
that
we
put
into
evidence
in
the
district
court
were
taken
in
the--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--well--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--no.
what
happened
was,
those
cases
were
settled.
then
what
happened
was,
and
we...
what
had
happened
was,
we
had
filed
a
lawsuit
in
district
court
contending
the
procedure
was
unconstitutional.
the
cases
were
settled.
the
district
court
lawsuit
was
dismissed
without
prejudice,
pursuant
to
the
agreement,
and
then
notices
were
issued
again.
we
filed
this
lawsuit
after
one
of
the
notices,
the
notice
was
issued--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--no.
we
never
needed
to,
so
we
didn't.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
no,
i
mean,
we
didn't
need
to
to
get
the
money
back.
we
preserved...
we
would
have
filed
to
the
extent
we
needed
to
to
get
our
money
back.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
yes.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
i...
well,
they
released
the
notices
to
withhold.
i
can...
that
is...
the
deal
is,
he
released
the
notices
to
withhold.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
well,
there
were
more
notices
to
withhold
issued
later
by
dlse,
after
the
facts
that
are
in
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
there
was
one
project
that
was
litigated
and
is
still
in
litigation,
that
was
litigated
on
a
lawsuit
by
the
dlse.
the
other
two,
they
released
the
notices
to
withhold,
and
the
answer
is
yes
on
those
two
projects.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
well,
the
federal
court
never
ordered
them
to
release
the
notices
to
withhold.
the
federal
court
just
declared
that
they
were
unconstitutional,
the
procedure
was
unconstitutional,
and
that
any
notices
were
null
and
void.
they...
and
then
they
released
the
notices.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
i
would
assume
it
was.
i
mean,
in
other
words--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--they
would...
no,
they
would
just
have
to
have
a
hearing
procedure.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
the--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--well,
on
some
projects
there
were.
on
some
projects--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--in
one
case
there
was.
on
the
other
two
they
dropped
the
claims
ultimately
and
didn't
pursue
them.
they
filed...
in
one
they
filed
a
lawsuit
and
they
abandoned
it
after...
it
was
dismissed
for
failure
of
prosecution
in
the
state
court.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
yes.
we've
always
claimed
compliance.
we--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--well,
on
the
brief
on
page
50,
at
the
end,
it
says,
g
&
g
did
plead
and
prove
that
it
disputed
the
assertion
that
it
violated
the
prevailing
wage
law,
citing
to
the
joint
appendix
at
69
and
at
the
191,
wherein
the
declaration
by
g
&
g
says,
it
disputes
these
violations
of
the
prevailing...
that
there
weren't
violations
of
the
prevailing--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--yes,
the
last
paragraph.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
well--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--well,
that's
correct.
we
didn't
litigate
in
the
district
court
whether
or
not...
we
didn't
litigate
the
underlying
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
or
was
not
a
violation.
i
mean,
our
contention
in
the
case,
and
our
contention
of
the
property
interest,
is
as
follows.
maybe
in
a...
let
me
use
an
example
to
try
to
explain.
an
awarding
body,
which
can
be
school
district,
a
city
or
whatever,
makes
a
determination
that
payment
is
due
under
the
contract,
so
let's
say,
they
say
today,
payment
is
due,
pick
up
the
check
friday.
on
thursday,
at
that
point
there
is
a
marketable
common
law
right
to
property,
the
right
to
money
due,
that
has
a
value.
if
the
payment
request
was
submitted
on
behalf
of
the
subcontractor,
then
the
payment
that's
made
by
the
awarding
body
to
the
prime
contractor
passes.
it
then
goes
to
the
subcontractor,
so
that
that
property
right
that
exists
at
that
time,
there's
a
property
right
of
the
prime
contractor
and
the
subcontractor.
the
prime
contractor's
right
as
to
that
money
is
of
little
value.
the
valuable
right
is
the
subcontractor.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
because
he
has
to
turn
that
money
over
immediately
to
the
subcontractor,
so
it
wouldn't
have--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--right.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
i
mean...
i
mean,
it's...
i
just
mean
monetarily.
it's
a
marketable
right,
and
it's
a
common
law
property
right.
then
the
dlse
issues
a
notice
to
withhold
the
next
day.
it
seizes
that
property,
and--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--it
goes--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--it
goes
to
the
awarding
body,
and
the...
which
is
not
in
privity
with
the
dlse.
what
distinguishes
it
from
a
breach
of
contract
is
that...
is,
i
would
say,
five
factors,
that
you
have
regulatory
enforcement
action
enforcing
the
law,
by
regulatory
enforcement
officials
not
party
to
the
contract,
imposing
penalties
and...
or
third
party
liabilities,
taking
money
due
under
the
contract
with
no
risk
of
a
proprietary
loss.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
you
have
a
right
to
the
money
due.
that
money
due
is
paid
by
the
awarding
body.
when
the
notice
to
withhold
seizes
the
money
by
issuing
it
to
the
awarding
body,
who
i
would
point
out
has
the
same
discretion
that
the
prime
contractor
is
said
to
have...
the
awarding
body
has
to
put
aside,
if
it's
a
$50,000
notice
to
withhold,
$50,000.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
the
right
of
the
subcontractor
is
to
receive
the
money
paid
by
the
awarding
body.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
he
does
up
until
the
time
the
notice
to
withhold
is
issued.
then
at
that
time
he
does
not.
at
that
time,
the
only
right,
it's
transformed
into
a
new
right.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
because
the
seizure
of
the
money
by
the
state--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--well,
i--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--actually,
it's
not,
because
there's...
the
prime
contractor
has
an
obligation,
when
he
receives
the
money
from
the
awarding
body,
to
pay
it
to
the
subcontractor.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
correct,
and
so
that
when
the--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--in
the
case
of
a
subcontractor,
what
is
different
is
that
when
the...
when
a
notice
to
withhold
seizes
the
money
due
to
the
awarding
body--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--your
honor,
that's
not
actually
what's
happening
here,
because
the
party
to
the
contract
is
the
owner
of
the
property,
which
in
these
cases
was
a
public
entity.
it
can
be
a
private
entity
under
public--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--absolutely.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
they're
not
in
privity.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
and
in
fact
the--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
well,
it
changes...
first
practically,
and
then
legally.
what
changes
practically
is
that
when
you
don't
pay
in
the
hypothetical
you
take
a
proprietary
risk.
if
you
don't
pay,
then
you're
subject
to
potential
losses
imposed
by
the
contractor
who
doesn't
pay.
if
an
owner,
like
an
awarding
body,
like
a
school
district
or
whatever,
says
i'm
not
going
to
pay
you,
they
take
the
proprietary
risk.
you
take...
they
take
a
proprietary
risk.
you,
as
a
contractor,
can
generate
a
lot
of
leverage
to
prevent
baseless
refusals
to
pay
by
an
owner.
you...
when
the
dlse
as
an
enforcement
agency
seizes
money,
you
have
no
leverage
and
no
ability
to
generate
leverage.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
okay.
the
difference--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--it--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--it
differs
if
getting
the
muddy
boots...
if
the
muddy
boot
problem
is
a
violation
of
the
law
and,
rather
than
you
saying,
under
the
contract,
i'm
asserting
the
muddy
boot
problem,
the
enforcement
official
from
the
building
department,
let's
say,
issues
an
order
and
orders
you
not
to
pay
the
contractor,
and
you
now
cannot
pay
pursuant
to
that
order,
then
the
order
by
that
official,
we
would
contend,
is
a
deprivation
of
property.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
i
think
the
difference,
your
honor,
is
that
in
the
circuit
court
cases
that
dealt
with
the
question
of
whether
there's
a
property
right,
they
were
dealing
with
the
question
of
a
different
right,
a
right
that
never
existed
at
common
law,
and
it's
not
a
marketable
right.
the
question
they
were
addressing
was,
is
the
right
that
the
other
party
won't
breach
the
contract
now
a
property
right
based
on
the
status
of
a
contract
with
the
government?
that's
a
different
property
right
than
the--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--than
the
common
law
right
to
the
money
due.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
you
could
sue
under
the
labor
code.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
you
could
have
a
lawsuit
where
the
money
is
held
until
all
appellate
rights
are
exhausted.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
on
other
cases?
yes,
we
did
have
lawsuits.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
no.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
we
sued
the
awarding
body.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
we...
but
it's...
the
awarding
body
is
a
nominal
party.
the
dlse
defends
the
case
as
a
real
party
in
interest,
so
you're
really
litigating
with
the
dlse.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
the
prime
contractor
has
a
defense
under
the
labor
code.
as
long
as
that
notice
to
withhold
is
pending--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--if
a
lawsuit
is
not
filed
under
the
labor
code
within
90
days
of
completion,
then
the
seizure,
the
notice
to
withhold
becomes
permanent,
so
that
if
you're
the
subcontractor,
and
you're
the
one
suffering
the
loss
because
it's
been
passed
through
to
you,
if
you
don't
endeavor
to
protect
that
right
in
general,
in
the
prime
contractor
suit,
then
the
prime
contractor
clearly
would
have
an
absolute
defense
to
your
lawsuit
under
the
contract
because
he--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--well,
either
way--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--if
the
prime
contractor
files
the
lawsuit
under
the
labor
code,
then
so
long
as
that
lawsuit
is
pending,
he
has
a
defense
under
the
labor
code,
and
generally
because--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--i
don't
believe
the
court
would
even,
frankly,
hear
the
issue.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
they
would
say,
until
the
labor
code
lawsuit
is
decided--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--yes.
that's
the
law.
that
is
the
law.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
that
is
the
law
under
the
labor
code.
the
exclusive
remedy
to
seek
recovery
of
the
money
held
is
the
labor
code
procedure--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--the
labor
code
says
the
money
can
be
withheld
by
the
prime
contractor
from
the
subcontractor,
so
that--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--well,
the
difficulty,
your
honor,
though,
is
that
the
problem
here,
the
due
process
problem
that
we
addressed
in
the
courts
below,
is
that
when
you
have
enforcement
officials
who
are
issuing
these
notices
to
withhold,
that
they
can
issue
in
any
amount
as
they
deem
fit,
in
which
they
have
no
proprietary
risk
in
doing
that,
so
it's
not
like
dealing
with
a
party
to
a
contract.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
with
regard
to
this
withholding,
yes.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
no.
what
i
meant
is,
as
to
the
withholding
of
money,
that--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--no.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
1729.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
it
assumes
that
the...
well,
yes,
in
a
sense.
it
assumes
the
prime
contractor--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--right.
if
the
prime
contractor
forfeited
their
right
under
the
labor
code,
then
it
would
be
a
different
situation.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
seizure
of
the
money
means
that
it
takes
you
years
to
take
that
money
back.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
your
honor,
there...
i...
there
was
no
provision...
there
is
no
provision
other
than
some
regulations
that
were
adopted
in...
temporary
regulations
in
response
to
this
lawsuit.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
there's
no
such
procedure
that
exists.
that
procedure
that
is
being
referred
to
is
either
of
the
statutes
that
are
not
in
effect
yet,
or
i
believe...
it's...
1742.1--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--there
was
absolutely
no
right
to
a
hearing.
there's
no
right
to
a
hearing
that
exists
in
any
statute
other
than
what
hearing
rights
they
have
said
they're
going
to
implement
in
july
of
this
year.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
there
was
no...
and
our
contention--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--no
hearing
rights
of
any
kind,
no
right
of
any...
the
only
way
to
know
the
basis
of
the
notice
to
withhold
is
to
file
the
lawsuit,
subpoena
the
dlse
records,
subpoena
them
to
a
deposition,
and
discover
on
what
basis
they
asserted
this
notice
to
withhold.
there's
no
other
right
to
any
information.
there's
no
other
right
to
anything.
that--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--but
the
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
the
fundamental
due
process
problem
here,
which
is
also
what,
in
their
first
petition
and
in
other
briefs,
the
dlse
has
stated
what
they
call
the
critical
failing,
the
real
injury
that
occurs
here,
and
what
we
believe
is
the
due
process
problem,
is
that
you
have
enforcement
officials
seizing
this
money...
whether
it's
a
prime
contractor
or
subcontractor,
you're
in
the
same
boat
with
an
assignment
or
a
prime
contractor,
they
can
seize
money
in
any
amount.
there's
no
type
of
hearing.
there's--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--and
whether
you've
paid
it
is
determined
in
this
labor
code
lawsuit
that's
provided
for.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
well,
right,
and
in
either
event,
even
if
you
had
the
right
to
sue
the
prime
contractor,
you
still
have
the
problem
that
you
have
enforcement
officials
that
can
cut
off
your
payments
without
any
hearing
right,
and--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--well,
yes,
and
therefore
that's
why
i
don't
think
the
court
would
even
litigate--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--we
were
suing
under
the
labor
code,
it's
a
labor
code
lawsuit
that
you're
allowed
to
get
the
money
back.
the
problem,
the
due
process
problem--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--17--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--1731
through
1733.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
yes,
and
if
you're
a
subcontractor--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--well,
no.
it's
nominally
the
awarding
body,
but
the
real
party
in
interest
is
the
dlse,
who
defends
the
lawsuit.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
no,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
because
when
you
have
a
seizure
by
enforcement
officials,
something
is
forfeited
for
a
violation
of
law,
the
court
has
stated
in
prior
cases
that
there
needs
to
be
some
type
of
a
right
to
at
least
a
prompt
post-deprivation
hearing
to
determine
if
there's
a
basis
of
probable
validity
for
the
seizure.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
right,
because
all
of
the
money--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--because
even
if
it's
completely
baseless,
the
dlse
action,
completely
meritless
baseless
action,
the
procedure
is,
all
the
money
is
held
until
the
completion
of
the
lawsuit
and
appellate
rights,
so
they
can
hold
money
for
3
years.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
we
contend
we
are...
we've
always
contended
we
are
a
prime
contractor
and
a
subcontractor.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
exactly.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
no,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
actually,
no.
your
honor.
none
of
the--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--well,
yes.
yes.
in
that
sense,
all
of--
mr.
stephen
a.
seideman
--on
all
contracts
there
are,
your
honor,
laws
that
one
has
to
comply
with,
including
these.
there
are
safety
laws--
