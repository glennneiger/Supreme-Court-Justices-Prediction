mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
california
labor
code
does
not
deprive
respondent
of
a
property
interest
without
due
process
for
three
reasons.
first,
respondent
has
not
established
a
present
entitlement
to
payment
of
money
from
the
state,
second,
with
respect
to
a
cause
of
action,
respondent
has
not
established
that
it
was
subject
to
a
deprivation,
and
third,
with
respect
to
any
property
interest
at
issue
in
this
case,
a
lawsuit
for
the
recovery
of
money
allegedly
owed,
breach
of
contract
or
otherwise,
is
all
the
process
that
is
due.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
roth
is
different
from
this
case
for
two
reasons.
when
the
state
accorded
the
individual
a
for-cause
termination
contract
in
that
case
he
had
a
present
property
interest
in
his
employment
that
the
state
could
not
deprive
him
of
without
some
predeprivation
process.
under
progress--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
to
the
extent
he
could
not...
there
was
no
property
interest
in
reemployment,
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
property
interest
because
he
didn't
have
a
guaranteed
right
to
reemployment
in
roth.
in
cases
like
loudermill,
where
the
person
could
not
be
dismissed
and
had
a
guaranteed
right
to
continued
employment,
this
court
said
there
had
to
be
a
hearing
before
they
could
dismiss
him
for
cause,
and
a
person
in
that
case,
where
there
is
a
for-cause
termination
provision,
has
a
present
property
interest
in
their
employment,
which
cannot
be
taken
away
from
them
absent
some
sort
of
hearing.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
the
latter
is
much
more
akin
to
the
payments
at
issue
in
sullivan,
which
progress
payments
under
an
installment
contract
are
typically
understood
to
be
earned
one
at
a
time,
as
the
performance
for
each
installment
is
performed,
and
the
failure
of
a
party
to
perform
all
the
requirements
in
the
contract,
including
in
this
case
the
prevailing
wage
term,
is
the
failure
of
a
constructive
condition
or,
in
this
case,
an
expressed
condition
that
would
give
rise
to
the
entitlement
for
payment.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
because
one
of
the
rights...
in
terms
of
present
entitlement
to
payment,
the
california
law
and
the
contracts
provide
that
the
immediate
right
to
payment
doesn't
attach
in
cases
of
dispute
until
the
plaintiff
has
proven
his
entitlement,
so
in
this
case
the
cause...
the
lawsuit
is
the
mechanism
by
which
entitlement
is
proved,
so
that
would
not
establish
a
present
property
interest
in
immediate
payment,
but
it
would
certainly
establish
a
property
interest
in
the
cause
of
action
for
payment.
but
with
respect
to
the
cause
of
action,
we
don't
believe
respondent
has
suffered
a
deprivation,
because
he's
never
made
an
effort
to
assert
that
cause
of
action.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
precisely
the
opposite--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--precisely
the
opposite,
justice
scalia.
a
chose
in
action
is
a
species
of
property.
however,
respondent
in
this
case
has
not
attempted
to
assert
its
cause
of
action,
and
the
state
has
not
purported
to
exterminate
it.
accordingly,
there
hasn't
been
a
deprivation.
until
he
attempts
to
assert
his
cause
of
action
the
state
or
somebody
else--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--right,
but
it
hasn't
been--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--it
is
property.
it
just
hasn't
been...
there's
been
no
deprivation
until
you
go
into
court
and
the
court
says,
there's
no
cause
of
action,
we
will
not
recognize
it,
and
you
cannot
convert
this
into
a
right
to
payment.
the
example
is,
in,
for
example,
logan
v.
zimmerman
brush,
the
person
submitted
a
claim
for
payment.
that
was
a
property
right.
when
the
court...
excuse
me,
when
the
agency
in
that
case
said,
oh,
we've
moved
to
slowly,
accordingly
we're
not
going
to
make
good
on
this
claim
for
payment,
and
anyway,
even
if
you're
entitled,
it
terminated
that
property
interest.
it
no
longer
existed.
the
chose
of
action
was
erased,
and
the
person
was
remitted
to
a
lawsuit
for
a
court
action
to
try
and
recover
damages.
in
contrast,
where
you
submit
the
claim,
and
the
court
is
considering
it,
or
you're
sitting
on
the
claim
and
you
have
not
yet
submitted
it,
the
state
hasn't
passed
on
whether
it's
going
to
terminate
it,
or
whether
it's
going
to
respect
it.
it's
simply
sitting
there,
an
inchoate
cause
of
action
that
you
have
not
yet
asserted.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
we
don't
believe
you...
when...
in
the--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--right.
when
you
have
a
chose
in
action,
whether
you
have
asserted
it
or
not,
that
is,
in
our
view,
a
property
interest.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
what
going
to
court
does
is,
it
may
terminate
it,
or
it
may
cause
it
to
ripen
into
a
right,
full
right
to
payment,
so
in
this
case,
because
the
cause
of
action
has
never
been
asserted,
there's
been
no
deprivation
of
the
cause
of
action.
for
example,
respondent
in
this
case
never
sought
an
assignment
of
the
prime--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--right.
it
is
in
a
sense
a
lot
like
williamson
county.
it's
akin
to
a
ripeness
argument.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
there's
no
taking
without
just
compensation,
if
you
haven't
sought
the
compensation
which
you
claim
to
be
your
due.
in
our
view,
there
is
no
deprivation
of
property
in
the
form
of
a
chose
of
action
without
due
process
unless
you've
asked
for
the
process
that's
your
due
and
the
state
has,
in
fact,
said
to
you,
you
cannot
have
process.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that,
i
think,
is
inherent
in
the
nature
of
recognizing
that
a
chose
of
action
is
a
species
of
property.
the
chose
of
action,
by
its
very
nature,
is
recognized
and
turned
into
a
present
right
to
payment
through
judicial
or
administrative
process.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
to
the
extent...
well,
to
the
extent
that
a
chose
of
action
is
at
issue
here--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--we
think
there
has
been
no
deprivation
here
and,
based
on
the
post-1998
version
of
the
statutes,
we
believe
that
there
is
state
action.
based
on
the
version
of
the
statute
that
the
ninth
circuit
examined,
however,
we
dispute
whether
a
state
action
has
been
established.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that
was
what
the
ninth
circuit's
analysis
was,
and
i
would
agree
with
you
that
that
is
incorrect.
however,
as
of
january
1,
1998,
the
state
has
authority
to
either
order
the
prime
contractor
to
withhold
money,
and
the
second
thing
is
that
it
also
exempts
the
prime
contractor
from
certain
penalties
if
the
prime
contractor...
and
this
is
section
1775(b)(1)
through
(4)
are
the
relative
provisions,
post-1998.
it
exempts
the
prime
contractor
from
penalties
if
the
prime
contractor
withholds
money
from
the
subcontractor.
when
the
state
threatens
penalties
against
a
prime
contractor
for
not
withholding,
we
would
believe
that
is
sufficient
to
establish
state
action.
when
it's
left
holding--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--i...
justice
breyer,
i
think
what
i
hear
you
asking
is,
when
the
state
does
not
take
coercive
action
against
the
prime
contractor
and
merely
enables
him
to
withhold
money,
i
would
agree
with
you,
there
is
no
state
action.
when
the
state
threatens
the
prime
contractor
with
penalties
and
coerces
them
to
withhold
money,
that
would
be
different.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that,
i
think,
is
the
due
process
question
you're
asking,
not
the
state
action
question,
which
is--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--with
respect
to
the
prime
contractor,
but
the
subcontractor--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes.
with
respect
to
the
subcontractor,
we
don't
believe
that
there
is
state
action
based
on
the
mere
fact
that
the
state
authorizes
a
prime
contractor
to
withhold
money,
so
i
think
i'm
in
firm
agreements
with
you,
justice
breyer.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
on
the
contrary,
your
honor.
the
state
is
not
taking
money
out
of
the
prime
contractor's
hands.
this
is
money
that
is
already
in
the
state's
hands.
the
state
is
merely
saying--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--prime
contractor,
you
have
breached
your
requirement
of
ensuring
that
all
workers
on
this
project,
all
workers,
whether
yours
or
a
sub's,
are
paid
the
prevailing
wage.
because
you
have
breached
that
obligation,
we...
a
constructive
condition
has
failed,
and
we
are
not
paying
you
the
money
that
would
otherwise
be
due.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
right.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
we're
not
withholding
the
amount
that
you
would
have
paid
your
subcontractor.
we
are
withholding
the
amount
that
wasn't
paid
to
the
workers.
we're
withholding
the
amount
that
is
the
measure
of
your
breach.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
and
we
are
indifferent--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no,
that
the
subcontractor
has
to
pay
to
the
workers--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--right,
but
the
state
is
utterly
indifferent
as
to
whether
the
prime
contractor
withholds
that
money
from
the
subcontractor
under
the
pre-1998
version,
because
it's
the
prime
contractor--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--thank
you.
