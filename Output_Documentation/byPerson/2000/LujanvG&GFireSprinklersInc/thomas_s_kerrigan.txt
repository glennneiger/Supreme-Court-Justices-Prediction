mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
this
court--
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
--very
well,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
on
a
second
time
for
review
before
this
court
following
the
initial
petition
for
granting
petition
for
certiorari
in
1999,
when
the
court
vacated
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit,
and
sent
the
case
back
for
reconsideration
under
this
court's
decision
in
american
manufacturers
mutual
insurance
company
v.
sullivan.
we
argued
at
that
time
that
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
was
a
radical
departure
from
established
principles
of
constitutional
law,
and
the
cases
decided
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
the
court,
we
would
submit,
has
only
paid
lip
service
to
this
court's
decision
in
sullivan
and
again
renders
a
decision
which
compounds
confusion
in
the
law
and
is
again
a
radical
departure.
the
ninth
circuit
again
takes
the
position
that
any
interest
or
any
declaim
for
payment
under
a
public
works
contract
is
a
property
interest
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
is
a
decision
and
a
viewpoint
which
is
contrary
to
every
other
circuit
that
has
decided
that
question,
including
the
second
district
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
first
and
seventh
circuits.
also,
in
the
ninth
circuit
the
position
has
been
for
a
number
of
years,
as
reflected
in
san
bernadino
physicians
services,
that
these
types
of
interests
in
construction
contracts,
public
construction
contracts,
were
not
within
the
concept
of
property
within
the
due
process
clause.
this
court
in
sullivan
made
it
clear
that
in
order
to
determine
that
there
was
a
property
interest,
that
a
plaintiff
had
to
pass
certain
minimum
standards,
had
to
surmount
certain
hurdles
of
pleading
and
evidence
that
were
never
surmounted
in
this
case
and
it
is
clear
in
this
case
that,
to
use
the
language
of
sullivan,
that
plaintiff
has
never
made
good
on
its
claim.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
there
is,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
the
legislature
has
enacted
some
new
laws
which--
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
--there
are
some
instances
under
the
new
law
where
the
dlse,
the
division
of
labor
standards
enforcement,
can
require
a
withholding.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
under
the
law
that
existed
at
this
time,
the
only
party
who
is
required
to
withhold
was
the
awarding
body,
the
state
agency.
the
private
parties,
the
general
contractor,
the
prime
contractor
was
not
required
to
withhold.
that
was
a
matter
within
his
discretion.
now--
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
--well,
to
start
with
the
very
obvious,
justice
ginsburg,
there
would
be
the
situation
where
the
prime
doesn't
owe
any
money
to
the
sub.
they
get
the
withholding
notice,
there's
nothing
to
withhold.
that's
a
very
obvious
example.
there
are
also
examples,
for
instance,
where
the
situation
of
the
subcontractor
would
be
such
that
if
there
was
a
withholding
it
would
put
him
out
of
business,
and
it
might
be
in
the
interest
of
the
prime
contractor
not
to
put
the
sub
out
of
business
because
it
might
jeopardize
performance
under
the
contract.
that
is
another
example.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
yes.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
that
has
happened.
that
does
happen.
there
are
long-term
relationships
in
this
industry.
some
of
these
people
have
been
dealing
with
each
other
for
years.
there
are
situations
where
they
could
be
fixed,
where
people
have
trust
in
each
other,
and
in
fact
that
has
occurred,
yes.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
there
would
be.
the
law
requires
that.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
violation,
it
certainly
could,
and
some
of
these
violations
are
very
substantial,
and
the
amounts
of
money
are
very
substantial.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
that
is
indeed
the
case,
and
that's
been
the
history
of
the
construction
industry.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
he...
absolutely.
he
would
be
absolutely
be
liable.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
that's
the
only
way
to
read--
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
--absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
well,
that's
in
fact
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
the
relationship
of
the
prime
and
the
sub
in
this
industry,
and
as
far
as...
and
as
long
as
this
industry
has
existed,
has
been
that
if
there
are
situations
of
this
kind
under
custom
and
practice,
the
prime
withholds.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
yes.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
that's
correct,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
not
only
did
they
not
sue,
they
never
submitted
any
kind
of
a
claim
that
we're
aware
of.
they
never
reduced
any
kind
of
a
claim
to
writing
that
we're
aware
of,
and
when
we
talk
about
a
claim
in
this
case
we're
talking
about
something
that's
an
abstraction,
because
g
&
g
never
availed
itself
of
any
remedies
in
any
california
court.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
never.
never,
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
where
they
ever
made
the
claim
that
they
complied
with
the
prevailing
wage
requirements,
or
any
other
conditions
of
the
contract.
there's
nothing
in
the
record,
and
we've
been
in
front
of
the
ninth
circuit
three
times
on
this,
we've
been
in
the
district
court
two
or
three
times,
and
there's
no
such
claim.
now,
one
of
the
other
questionable,
we
suggest,
determinations
of
the
ninth
circuit
was
that
a
cause
of
action,
a
trial
in
a
court
of
law
was
not
a
hearing
within
the
meaning
of
due
process,
that
somehow
there
was
some
requirement
that
the
hearing
had
to
be
an
administrative
hearing,
and
we
believe
that
that
is
contrary
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
cases
like
hudson
v.
palmer,
and
ingraham
v.
wright,
where
the
court
at
least
in
those
cases
suggested
that
a
trial
in
a
court
of
law
was,
indeed,
a
hearing
within
the
meaning
of
due
process.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
there
is...
certainly
that
could
have
been
done
informally,
and
there's
certainly
communications
between
the
parties.
there
was
no
such
administrative
procedure
at
that
time.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
there
was
a
temporary
regulation
put
in
effect
during
the
course
of
this
appeal
that
has
been
utilized
prospectively,
and
there
have
been
a
number
of
hearings
under
that
regulation,
but
there
was
none
at
this
time.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
well--
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
--justice
scalia,
we
would
say
it
is
completely
different
than
a
garnishment.
we
would
say
there
is
a
spectrum
of
situations
that
one
would
pose
in
these
cases.
you
have
on
the
far
end
of
the,
extreme
end
of
the
spectrum
cases
that
like
the
james
good
realty,
the
hawaiian
case,
where
a
party
was
divested
of
real
property
interest.
you
have
the
sniadach
case,
where
there
was
a
garnishment,
where
property
is
in
possession
of
the...
let's
say,
the
subcontractor,
and
that
property
is
divested
and
the
right
is
divested.
this
is
a
situation
where
there
are
two
parties,
one
party
claims
that
the
other
party
is
not
entitled
to
the
property,
or
in
this
case
the
money,
and
the
other
party
is
claiming
that
they
are
entitled
to
the
money.
we
think
it's
perfectly
reasonable,
especially
in
view
of
the
well-known
insolvency
of
the
subcontractors,
that
for
the
protection
of
the
workers
on
these
projects,
that
the
withholding
is
appropriate.
and
justice
stevens
in
sullivan
said,
and
i
think
that...
as
we
said
in
our
brief,
i
think
that
philosophy
kind
of
tends
to
underscore
the
decision
in
sullivan
that
there
is
nothing
unreasonable
if
a
party
in
good
faith,
who
has
possession
of
the
property
or
the
goods,
takes
the
position
that
they're
going
to
hold
onto
that
property
to
preserve
the
status
quo
until
some
kind
of
a
reasonable
determination
can
be
made,
and
we
don't
think
it's
high-handed.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
it
isn't
like
a
garnishment,
where
there
is
a
clear
entitlement,
property
interest
in
the
property
or
money.
here
there's
a
disputed
claim,
and
that's
all
there
is,
and
we
are
saying,
based
on
the
disputed
claim,
we're
not
going
to
pay
you
for
the
box
of
ballpoint
pens
that
the
supplier
gave
us.
we're
going
to
withhold
payment
on
that.
if,
every
time
the
state
does
not
pay
its
bills
on
time
because
there's
a
dispute,
a
good-faith
dispute,
and
if
that's
going
to
be
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause,
we
don't
think
that's
what
was
intended
by
the
people
who
drafted
the
due...
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
well,
as
this
court
has
said
in
sullivan
and
almost
every
other
case,
the
first
inquiry
is
always
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
property
right,
if
any,
and
you
can't
get
to
that
point
in
this
case
or
any
other
case
until
you've
determined
that
there
is
a
property
right
within
the
meaning
of
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
well,
we
disagree,
obviously,
on
that
point.
we
think
the
situation
is
such,
because
of
the
interest
of
the
state
and
because
of
the
workers
who
would
be
affected,
and
because
of
the
notorious
insolvency
of
subcontractors,
that
it's
an
appropriate
mechanism.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
well--
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
--it
is
not
property--
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
--because,
as
the
court
said
in
roth,
it's
a
unilateral
expectation.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
well,
that
was
a
different
situation.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
it
was
also
an
individual
claiming
right
under
a
contract
in
a
whole
line
of
cases,
beginning
with
goldberg
v.
kelly,
where
there
has
been
expansion
in
the
area
of
due
process
claims.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
would
reserve
my--
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
--yes.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
yes,
we
would.
we
definitely
would.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
thank
you,
your
honor.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i--
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
--there
were
a
number,
your
honor.
there
was,
for
instance,
the
remedy
under
1733,
which
is
the
labor
code
section.
that
section
says
the
contractor
or
its
assignee
may
bring
a
lawsuit
within
90
days.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
there
is
a
case
that
came
down...
it
came
down
since
this
case
was
first
argued,
which
says...
it's
called
j
&
k
painting.
it's
in
our
brief,
but
i
would
refer
you
to
footnote
number
7,
which
seems
to
suggest
that
they
would
be
an
assignee
in
law
if
the
assignment
wasn't
given.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
and
as
a
matter
of
reality,
there
is
no
reason
for
the
prime
contractor
not
to
assign.
the
prime
contractor
doesn't
want
any
part
of
this
suit.
they
have
no
economic
interest
in--
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
--yes.
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
that
is
not
the
case,
your
honor.
there
is
a
stop-notice
provision.
the
stop-notice
provision
is
in
the
code.
it
was
referred
to
on
page
36-37
of
our
brief.
that
provides
for
a
very
summary
hearing.
the
g
&
g
type
contractor
files
a
stop
notice
with
the
state,
the
state
withholds
money
from
the
prime
contractor,
and
there
is
a
hearing
in
a
very
short
period
of
time.
in
addition--
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
--there
are--
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
--no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
it
is
not
the
exclusive
remedy,
and
j
&
k--
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
--the...
again,
referring
to
j
&
k
painting--
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
--it
also
said
it
is
not
the
exclusive
remedy,
because
it
does
not
address
all
of
the
evils
that--
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
--i
believe
what
you're
referring
to,
justice,
is
the
provision
in
the
statute
that
says
no
other
issues
will
be
considered
than
the
issue
of
the
entitlement
to
the
money.
it
is
not
the
exclusive
remedy,
and
there
are...
one
of
the
things
that
the
ninth
circuit
said
is,
well,
there
aren't
a
lot
of
cases
involving
these
subcontractors
in
a
public
work
situations
under
the
law
of
contracts,
under
the
law
of
stop
notices.
the
reason
is,
is
because
there's
almost
always
an
assignment,
and
the
action
proceeds
under
1733,
and--
mr.
thomas
s.
kerrigan
--well,
the
j
&
k
painting
company
case
says
to
the
contrary,
your
honor,
and
we
would
submit
it
on
that.
we
would
submit...
that's
our
case.
thank
you.
