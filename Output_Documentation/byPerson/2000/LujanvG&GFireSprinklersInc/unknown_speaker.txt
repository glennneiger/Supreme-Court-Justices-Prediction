unknown
speaker
mr.
kerrigan,
has
the
california
law
changed
since
this
case
came
about?
unknown
speaker
under
the
new
law,
can
the
state
labor
department
require
the
withholding
by
the
contractor
from
the
sub?
unknown
speaker
but
the
law
at
the
time
this
case
arose
was
different,
and
there
was
no
requirement...
the
labor
department
couldn't
require
the
withholding,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
practical
instance
in
which
the
prime
would
not
withhold?
after
all,
the
prime
is
not
going
to
get
paid.
what
prime
would
want
to
keep
the
underpayment,
rather
than
shifting
it
to
a
third
party?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
if
practically
these...
i
know
you...
are
possibilities.
unknown
speaker
practically,
has
there
ever
been
a
case
where
dlse
has
told
the
prime,
we're
reducing
your
amounts
by
x,
where
there
hasn't
been
a
pass-on?
unknown
speaker
because
there
would
be
a
penalty.
it's
not
just
that
the
wages
would
be
withheld,
but
there
would
be
a
penalty
imposed,
a
daily
penalty,
isn't
that--
unknown
speaker
--so
it
could
mount
up
pretty
high.
unknown
speaker
even
if
there
were
no
statutory
provision
authorizing
the
prime
to
withhold,
wouldn't
it
be
true,
under
the
law
of
contract
in,
i
assume
every
state,
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
the
prime
could
withhold
anyway,
because
the
contract
law
is
assumed
to
be
made
to
incorporate
whatever
positive
legal
obligations
there
are,
and
if
there
is
a
positive
legal
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
sub
to
pay
a
prevailing
wage,
and
the
sub
is
not
doing
it,
couldn't
the
prime
say,
you
are
breaching
the
contract
to
that
extent,
and
because
i
can
be
sued
i'm
going
to
protect
myself
by
withholding
something
from
my
payment
to
you?
unknown
speaker
he
can
do
it,
but
he'd
be
liable
if
he
was
wrong
about
whether
the
sub
was
in
breach
or
not.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
he'd
be
accepting
on
faith
the
state's
determination
that
the
sub
was
in
breach,
and
if
he
was
wrong
about
it
he'd
be
liable
for
damages.
unknown
speaker
isn't
he
also
going
to
have
to
pay
the
sub
in
this
case
if
the
state
is
wrong?
unknown
speaker
sure,
so
my
question
is,
if
the
authorization
in
the
statute
is
a
key
to
a
determination
that
there
is
state
action
here,
wouldn't
the
general
law
of
contract
be
an
equal
key,
even
if
this
provision
did
not
exist?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
if
this
is
state...
put
it
another
way.
why
should
we
say
it
is
state
action
when
he
is
doing
absolutely...
the
prime
is
doing
absolutely
nothing
more
than
the
prime
could
do
under
the
general
law
of
contract?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.--
--you
would
accept
that
argument?
unknown
speaker
yes.
mr.
kerrigan,
g
&
g
fire
sprinklers,
the
respondent
here,
they
are
the
sub
we're
talking
about
here?
unknown
speaker
and
did
they
ever
sue
in
any
california
court
to
recover
what
they
claim
to
have
been
owed?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
further
question
on
that?
have
they
ever
represented
that
they
did,
in
fact,
comply
with
the
statutes
concerning
the
level
of
compensation?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
on
that
question...
i
understand
they
haven't
done
it,
but
is
there
an
administrative
procedure
in
which
they
could
have
said,
here
are
our
books,
take
a
look
at
it,
and
we've
done
everything
we're
supposed
to
do,
or
do
they
have
to
sue?
unknown
speaker
is
there...
under
the
amended
statute,
is
there
such
a
procedure?
unknown
speaker
it's
pretty
high-handed,
don't
you
think?
i
mean,
the
state,
without
giving
the
sub
even
a
chance
to
respond
to
these
allegations
simply
directs
the
prime
contractor
to
give
the
state
the
money
owed
to
the
sub?
it's
a
kind
of
garnishment,
i
guess,
and
that's
what
makes
it
a
little
different
from
the
ordinary
contract
case.
unknown
speaker
the
way
the
statute
reads,
what
you
must
pay
to
the
state
is
the
money
owing
to
the
sub.
unknown
speaker
but
the
one
difference
is,
as
justice
scalia
points
out,
it
isn't
the
prime
that
made
the
decision
to
do
this.
it's
the
state
agency,
the
enforcement
agency
said,
you
pay
over...
mr.
prime,
you
pay
over
to
the
state
what
would
otherwise
be
paid
to
the
sub.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
there
was
a
good-faith
dispute
in
roth
as
to
whether
the
employee
could
be
dismissed
or
not.
that
was
just
simply
a
contract
case,
and
we
said
you
couldn't
do
it
without
a
prior
hearing.
how
do
you
distinguish
roth
from
the
ordinary
contract
case?
unknown
speaker
and
if
i
have
someone
who
owes
me
under
a
contract,
i
have
a
valid
contract
claim
against
somebody,
the
state
can
take
that
away,
and
they
have
taken
away
property?
surely
that's
not
right.
unknown
speaker
the
state
can...
does
not
interfere
with
any
property
rights
when
it
takes
the
chose
in
action
that
i
have
against
somebody
who
owes
me
money?
the
state
can
simply
take
that,
and
i
have
no
remedy?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you're
saying
it's
not
property.
it
is
not
property.
unknown
speaker
that's
extraordinary.
unknown
speaker
they
held
it
was
a
property
right
in
roth.
unknown
speaker
it
was
a
contract
claim,
is
all
it
was,
same
as
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
may
i
just
ask
you
this
question?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
you
agree
that
there
would
be
a
statement
of
a
property
interest
if
the
claim
was
not
merely
that
they
withheld
money
from
me,
but
they
held,
withheld
money
from
me
under
a
contract
in
which
i
have
performed
every
obligation
that
i
had
under
that
contract.
would
you
agree
that
that
would
state
a
property
interest?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure.
well,
the
question
wasn't
asked
you.
[laughter]
thank
you,
mr.
kerrigan.
mr.
lamken,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
as
for
point
three,
how
do
you
explain
roth?
i
really
don't
understand
why
roth
is
different.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean?
we
were
talking
about
his
future
employment.
he
was
going
to
be
dismissed
for
the
next
year,
and
it
said,
you
know,
we're
terminating
you.
you
have
year-by-year
employment.
we're
not
going
to
reemploy
you
next
year.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
difference
between
a
present
property
interest
in
my
employment
and
a
present
property
interest
in
the
money
that
you
owe
me?
i
don't
understand
why
the
one
should
be
treated
differently.
unknown
speaker
what
if
we
assume
that
the
subcontractor
did
not
violate
the
law,
everything
was
fine,
the
state
was
just
in
error.
let's
just
make
that
assumption.
would
there
be
some
kind
of
property
right
in
the
subcontractor
to
expect
payment
under
the
contract?
unknown
speaker
so
california
can
simply
take
all
choses
in
action--
unknown
speaker
--because
they
don't
really
exist?
unknown
speaker
they
don't
exist
until
you've
proven
them
in
court
and
california
can
simply
take
them?
unknown
speaker
a
chose
in
action
is
a
chose
in
action
before
it's
asserted.
unknown
speaker
it
is
property,
before
it's
asserted.
you're
telling
me
it's
not
property
until
you
go
into
court?
unknown
speaker
but
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you're
doing
is
combining
the
analysis
of
whether
there
is
a
deprivation
of
a
property
interest
with
the
analysis
of
whether
there
is
an
adequate
state
process
for
asserting
it,
and
you
have
said,
i
guess
your
third
point
is,
there
is
an
adequate
state
process
and
therefore
there
has
been
no
denial
of
due
process
in
this
situation.
that
part
i
understand.
but
the
fact
that
you
haven't
gone
to
court
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
have
any
bearing
on
whether
you
have
a
property
interest
or
not.
unknown
speaker
then
i
misunderstood
you,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
you're--
unknown
speaker
--okay,
then
you're
saying
there's
no
due
process
violation
for
two
reasons,
number
1,
you
have
never
made
an
appropriate
claim.
number
2,
even
if
you
had,
there
is
an
adequate
state
process
in
a
right
to
sue.
are
those
the
two
points
you're
making?
unknown
speaker
but
that
comes
very
close,
as
others
have
suggested,
to
shifting
from
the
property
analysis
to
the
due
process
analysis.
unknown
speaker
well,
you...
just
to
make
one
thing
clear,
you
do
not
question
the
fact
that
there's
state
action
involved
here,
and
there
are
property
rights.
you're
just
saying
there's
no
violation
of
the
due
process
clause.
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
yes.
unknown
speaker
how
is
there
state
action?
you
have
a
contractor
who
decides
to
withhold
money
from
another
contractor.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
there's
obviously
state
action
in
the
state
law.
there
are
books
in
california
filled
with
state
laws,
and
anyone
could
complain
about
any
one
of
those
laws,
that
they
violate
the
constitution
and,
indeed,
if
you
had
a
law
governing
court
procedure,
which
you
thought
was
very,
very,
very
unfair,
i
suppose
that
might
violate
the
constitution,
too,
so
sure,
maybe
this
is
unconstitutional
in
that
sense,
but
in
that
sense,
what's
unconstitutional
about
it?
unknown
speaker
so
the
penalty...
it's
the
penalty.
in
other
words,
they're
assessing
a
penalty
of
money
against
a
contractor,
and
they
have
to
have
a
fair
procedure
for
doing
that.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
that
would
be
state
action,
and
it
would
have
to
comport
with
due
process.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
mean,
don't
we
have
the
sub
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
doesn't
coerce
the
contractor
to
withhold
money?
i
mean,
that
puts
it
a
little
kindly,
don't
you
think?
the
state
is
saying,
you
give
us
the
money
that
you
owe
to
the
sub.
unknown
speaker
yeah--
unknown
speaker
--well,
they
say
a
little
more
than
that.
you
have
breached
it
in
that
your
subcontractor
has
breached
it.
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
we
are
withholding
the
amount
that
you
would
have
paid
to
your
subcontractor,
and
you
don't
consider
that
to
be
inducing
the
prime
contractor
not
to
pay
off
the
sub?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
you're--
unknown
speaker
--you're
withholding
a
portion
of
the
money
that
he
was
supposed
to
pay
to
a
subcontractor--
unknown
speaker
--saying
that
he
doesn't
owe
it
to
the
subcontractor.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
lamken.
unknown
speaker
mr.
seideman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
seideman,
would
you
tell
us
just
what
your
client
did
after
the
prime
withheld
the
payment
by
way
of
seeking
redress,
or
responding
to
that?
unknown
speaker
this
was
in
the
california
superior
court?
unknown
speaker
this
was
in
response
to
the
withholding
by
the
prime
in
this
particular
case?
unknown
speaker
you
can
answer
that
yes
or
no,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
did
you
file
anything
in
state
court
after
this
particular
notice?
unknown
speaker
well,
you'll
find
out
here
whether
you
needed
to
or
not.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
oh,
so
you...
well
then,
you...
what,
you
got
your
money
back?
unknown
speaker
as
a
result
of
the
federal
suit?
unknown
speaker
so
the
respondent
has
been
paid
in
full,
under
this
contract?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
far
as
what
is
before
us,
has
the
respondent
been
paid
in
full
now?
unknown
speaker
was
the
release
the
result
of
some
order
from
the
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
so
the
release
was
in
response
to
that
order
of
the
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
would
they
have
to
do
to
comply
with
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit,
i
mean,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court,
which
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed?
it
said,
you
can't,
under...
consistent
with
due
process,
hold
back
this
money,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
now,
was
there
an
adjudication
whether
these
wages
had
been
paid
or
not?
was
there
ever
an
adjudication
concerning
whether
the
prevailing
wage
had
been
paid?
unknown
speaker
no,
on
the
ones
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
seideman,
you're
going
to
really
have
to
really
enlighten
me,
because
i
understood
your
opponent
to
answer
one
of
my
questions
by
saying
that
your
client
had
never
claimed
compliance
with
the
prevailing
wage
law
with
respect
to
the
contracts
in
dispute
in
this
case.
was
he
wrong?
unknown
speaker
where
in
the
record
do
you
show
that
you
claim
compliance
with
the
matters
in
dispute
here,
or
where
in
your
brief
do
you...
i
didn't
know
you
said
it
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
at
page
49
and
50
it
says,
the
withholding
was
adequately
pleaded
and
proven,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
you
say
that
you
had
complied
with
the
statue.
unknown
speaker
the
last
paragraph
says
that.
after
you
get
to
that...
the
last
paragraph
in
your
brief,
you
finally
get--
unknown
speaker
--that
last
paragraph
says,
you
proved
that
you
disputed
the
assertion
that
it
had
violated.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
is
the
prime's
right
of
little
value?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
he
gets
a
15-percent
override
or
something
like
that,
doesn't
he?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
he
gets
something.
unknown
speaker
whom
does
the
notice
to
withhold
go?
unknown
speaker
the
awarding
authority?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
think
those
take
it
out
of
the
ordinary
contract
law
that,
you
know,
if
the
prime
owes
you
money,
you're
the
sub,
you
have
a
contractual
right
to
that
money,
don't
you?
i
mean,
if
you
fully
completed
work,
and
there
has
been
no
notice
that
you
failed
to
pay
prevailing
wages,
you
have
a
right
against
the
prime,
don't
you?
at
least,
certainly
when
i
practiced
law
you
did.
unknown
speaker
but
the
prime's...
the
sub's
contract
is
with
the
prime,
isn't
it?
it's
not
with
the
awarding
body.
that's
what
mechanic's
liens
are
for.
if
you
can't
get
the
prime
to
pay,
you
could
perhaps
have
a
lien...
i
don't
know
what
california
law
is,
but
certainly
you
have
a...
your
contractual
relationship
is
with
the
prime.
unknown
speaker
but
does
the
subcontractor
have
a
contractual
right
against
the
prime
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
why
does
he
cease
to
have
a
right
at
that
time?
if
he
has
performed,
i
don't
know
why
he
doesn't
have
the
same
right
against
the
prime
whether
the
state
has
issued
a
notice
of
withholding
or
not.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you're
talking
about
the
money
as
though
the
money
were
particular
dollar
bills,
and
the
subcontractor
has
a
right
to
particular
dollar
bills
that
the
prime
gets
from
the
state.
i
mean,
that's
not
the
way
we
analyze
contracts.
the
sub
has
a
right
to
be
paid
for
the
work
that
he
did
in
accordance
with
his
contract
with
the
prime,
and
that
right
is
either
good
or
bad
quite
independent
of
what
is
happening
between
the
prime
and
the
state.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
true?
unknown
speaker
and
he
has
that
obligation
because
he
has
contracted
with
the
subcontractor
to
pay
him.
unknown
speaker
which
is
true
in
any
situation
in
which
there's
a
prime
and
a
sub,
so
what
is
different
about
the
fact
that
the
prime
in
this
case
has
contracted
with
the
state?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
say
seizes
the
money
due,
what
you
mean
is,
it's
a
notice
that
they
refuse
to
pay
under
their
contract
with
the
prime.
unknown
speaker
so
in
other
words,
you're
distinguishing
between
the
state
and
the
public
entity.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
is
where...
i
mean,
exact...
i
enter
into
a
contract
to
have
my
house
built,
but
the
prime
is
going
to
have
subs.
i
say,
when
you
get
to
the
garden,
i
don't
want
any
of
those
gardeners
walking
with
their
muddy
boots
in
the
house,
and
so
here's
what
happens.
if
that
gardener,
landscape
gardener
has
people
with
muddy
boots,
and
they
walk
around
the
house,
some
money
is
going
to
be
withheld
from
your
progress
payment,
including
$50
worth
of
liquidated
damages.
got
it?
yes,
they
got
it,
everybody's
got
it.
unknown
speaker
no
problem.
but
now
the
state
enters
into
that
exact
same
contract.
how
does
that
change
anything?
contract
disputes
are
not
property
under
roth,
zindeman,
et
cetera.
i
would
have
thought
that
was
hornbook,
and
so
what's
different
about
this?
unknown
speaker
well,
you've
lost
me...
i...
my...
you've
got
my
example
in
mind
of
the
muddy
boots.
unknown
speaker
now...
and
the
muddy
boots
has
$50
liquidated
damages
in
it,
and
by
the
way,
i
write
into
the
contract
too,
i
don't
care
about
the
boots.
it's
my
aunt
ella
who
cares--
[laughter]
--and
so
all
this
is
going
to
be
run
by
her,
and
she's
going
to
be
the
one
who
decides.
now,
i
guess
i
could
write
that
in,
too.
now,
i'm
just
saying
how
does
it
differ--
unknown
speaker
--because
we
happen
to
have
the
state
here,
and
we
don't
have
aunt
ella,
we
have
the
labor
department,
and
we
don't
have
exactly
a
progress
payment,
but
it's
pretty
analogous.
what's
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
know
that's
what
you're
contending
and
i
agree
with
you
totally
that
there
are
those
differences.
we
don't
have
aunt
ella,
we
have
a
person
who
is
called
the
labor
department,
and
it's
quite
true
that
she
doesn't
say
it
formally,
they
do
it
formally
in
an
order,
and
it's
true
that
the
contracting
party
is
the
state
and
not
a
private
person.
but
again,
if
we
accepted
your
view
that
it
makes
a
difference,
then
all
these
building
contracts
would
suddenly
become
state
action
under
roth,
zindeman,
et
cetera.
every
claim
like
that
would
end
up
in
court
under
some
kind
of
constitutional
analysis.
i've
never
heard
of
anything
like
that.
unknown
speaker
go
ahead.
finish
your
answer,
mr.
seideman.
unknown
speaker
you
say
you
did...
you
could
have
sued
in
the
state
court
over
this,
i
gather,
because
you
did
in
other
cases.
you
could
have
sued
the
prime
saying
it
was
wrong
to
withhold
my
progress
payment?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
could
sue
somewhere
under
california
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
and
i
gather
you
did
have
such
a
lawsuit,
did
you
not,
in
california
state
courts?
unknown
speaker
you
sued
the
prime?
unknown
speaker
who--
unknown
speaker
--you
sued
the...
and
why
did
you
not
sue
the--
unknown
speaker
--why
didn't
you
sue
the
prime
contractor?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i'm
sorry,
a
moment
ago,
if
i
was
following
what
you
were
saying,
you
were
telling
us
that
you
had,
in
fact,
pleaded
and
it
was,
in
fact,
the
case
that
you
had
performed
everything
that
you
were
obligated
to
perform
under
your
contract,
so
if
that
is
so,
why
didn't
you
simply
sue
the
prime
contractor
in
a
state
court
saying,
i've
done
everything
i
have
to
do,
give
me
my
money?
unknown
speaker
why
would
the
prime
contractor
have
a
defense
to
your
lawsuit
merely
because
the
prime
contractor
has
lost
his
defense
to
the
government's
withholding?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i'm
not
following.
unknown
speaker
even
if
you
sue
him
in
a
contract
action
in
california,
and
you
prove
what
you
have
represented
to
us
you
could
prove,
i.e.,
that
you
performed
everything
you
were
obligated
to
perform,
including
paying
the
prevailing
wage,
even
though
the
findings
were
that
you
had
proven
all
of
that,
the
prime
contractor
still
would
not
be
liable
to
you
under
the
contract,
because
it
was
engaged
in
a
dispute
with
the
state?
unknown
speaker
no--
unknown
speaker
--but
i'm
asking
you
a
question
about
california
law.
are
you
saying
that
that
is
california
law,
that
you
can
prove
your
case
and,
because
your
prime
is
having
a
dispute
with
the
state,
you
still
would
not
be
awarded
your
damages?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
law
of
california?
unknown
speaker
well--
--that's--
unknown
speaker
--that's
controverted.
i
am
sure
the
other
side
says
that
the
code
does
not
eliminate
any
cause
of
action
that
the
sub
has
against
the
prime.
now,
is
there
a
dispute
between
the
two
sides
on
that
issue?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
please
come
back
to
my
question.
you
are
contending
that
you
had
no
cause
of
action
against
the
prime,
that
any
cause
of
action
against
the
prime
for
his
breach
of
contract
with
you
was
suspended
by
the
labor
code.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have...
you've
answered
these
questions
with
some
qualification.
you
say,
you
couldn't
do
it
under
the
labor
code.
could
you
do
it
under
any
branch
of
california
law?
unknown
speaker
could
you
answer
my
question
yes
or
no?
could
you
have
sued
the
prime
alleging
that
you
had
fully
complied
and
had
paid
required
wages
in...
under
any
provision
of
california
law?
unknown
speaker
what
provision
of
the
labor
code
eliminates
that?
i
mean,
it's
rather
crucial
to
your
case.
what
provision
is
it?
unknown
speaker
1729.
that's--
--does
your
answer
assume
that
the
prime
has
made
an
assignment
to
the
sub
of
the
prime's
right
to
receive
the
money?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
that's
the
way
it
works,
isn't
it?
when
the
prime
withholds,
the
prime
generally
assigns
to
the
sub
the
right
to
litigate
for
the
money
with
the
agency,
with
the
contracting
agency.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
your
position
on
your
brief
was
that
there
was
no
guarantee
of
the
assignment,
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
you
said
you
had
no
remedy
is
that
the
labor
code
gives
the
prime
contractor
a
right
to
seek
the
money
that's
being
suspended,
and
the
labor
code
itself
doesn't
give
any
right
to
the
subcontractor,
and
therefore
you
said
that
there's
no
remedy
guaranteed
you
under
the
law,
i
thought
was...
that
was
the
position
you
took
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
a
provision,
though,
in
the
labor
code
allowing
a
prompt
hearing
with
the
labor
commission,
or
commissioner,
to
deal
with
this
problem
of
the
withholding.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
section
1742.1?
it
says
the
labor
commissioner
shall,
upon
receipt
of
a
request
from
the
affected
contractor
or
subcontractor,
within
30
days
of
the
assessment,
afford
the
opportunity
to
meet
concerning
the
assessment
and,
upon
request,
provide
a
hearing
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
did
you...
did
the
subcontractor
here
ask
for
a
hearing?
unknown
speaker
there
was
no
provision
for
a
hearing
in
effect
at
the
time
this
case
arose?
unknown
speaker
uh-huh.
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
none
for
you
at
the
time?
unknown
speaker
would
you
tell
us
where
we
could
find
section
1729?
i
can't
find
it
in
the
blue
brief...
108?
1727
is
there,
but
i
don't
see
1729.
it
goes
from
1727
to
1741.
page
108
of
the
petition
for
cert.--
unknown
speaker
--1720,
1729
says
that
it's
lawful
for
the
contractor
to
withhold
if
the
subcontractor
has
failed
to
comply
with
the
terms
of
this
chapter.
now,
if
you
have
paid
wages,
you
presumably
have
not
failed
to
comply
with
the
terms
of
the
chapter.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that,
this
section
1729
doesn't
say
that.
you're
saying--
--go
ahead.
i'm
sorry,
chief.
no,
i
take
it...
you're
saying
that,
i
take
it,
that
the
reference
that
the
language
on
account
of
failure
simply
refers
to
the
reason
given
by
the
state
for
withholding,
as
opposed
to
the
fact
of
failure
or
nonfailure.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
grant
you
that,
but
i
mean,
what
we
were
trying
to
get
at
is,
whether
you
had
a
cause
of
action
that
you
could
assert
in
a
california
court,
and
your
answer
is,
no,
i
don't,
because
even
if
i
prove
to
the
court's
satisfaction,
the
fact-finder's
satisfaction
that
i
have
paid
the
prevailing
rate,
so
long
as
the
prime
can
show
that
the
state
is
with...
or
the
public
authority
is
withholding
payment
because
the
state
claims
i
didn't,
that
is
a
defense.
that's
your
position.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
seideman,
what
were
the
suits
that
you
brought?
i'm
looking
at
your
brief,
at
page
3.
you
refer
to
prior
cases,
and
you
say,
a
state
court
ordered
g
&
g
and
dlse
to
mediate,
and
a
settlement
was
reached.
there
must
have
been
some
procedure
that
you
were
availing
yourself
of
under
state
law
and
state
court.
what
was
it?
unknown
speaker
under
what
section?
i...
you're
just--
unknown
speaker
--you're
making
it
so
difficult
for
us
because
the
sections
aren't
attached
to
the
brief.
we
don't
understand
what
you're
alleging.
under
what
section
of
the
labor
code?
unknown
speaker
and
that
allows
you
to
file
a
suit.
unknown
speaker
against
whom?
against
whom,
the
labor
department?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
not
adequate
post-deprivation
relief,
even
if
you
assume
there's
some
state
action
and
some
problem?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
well,
here's
a
right
to
a
post-deprivation
proceeding.
you
say
it
isn't
sufficiently
prompt?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
could
the
prime
make
the
same
argument,
constitutional
argument
that
you're
making
on
behalf
of
the
sub?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
so
whether
he's
a
prime
or
a
sub
makes
no
difference
for
purposes
of
the
argument
you're
presenting
to
us
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
don't
like
it,
don't
enter
into
the
contract.
i
mean,
aren't
all
these
terms
of
the
contract?
unknown
speaker
if
you
don't
like
the
terms,
don't
enter
into
it.
unknown
speaker
isn't
it...
under
california
law
they
don't
incorporate
the
law
into
the
contract?
i've
never
heard
of
that.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
so
they're
all
terms
of
the
contract,
so
the
answer
is,
you
have
a
claim,
you
think...
or
you
get
the
money,
they
think
you
don't.
they
set
up
some
procedures,
you
don't
like
them...
sorry.
unknown
speaker
thanks,
mr.
seideman.
mr.
kerrigan,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
would
you
mind
telling
us
just
what
post-deprivation
remedy,
if
we
assume
there
is
some
problem
here,
was
open
to
the
respondent
subcontractor?
unknown
speaker
is
he
an
assignee
automatically,
because
he's
the
subcontractor?
unknown
speaker
that's
how
i
would
read
it,
too.
unknown
speaker
well,
don't...
please
continue
to
answer.
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
know...
the
big
allegation
is,
they
have
no
adequate
post-deprivation
remedy,
and
their
lawyer,
as
i
understand
it,
is
saying
it
would
take
3
years
to
reach
closure
on
it,
so
what
is
your
response?
unknown
speaker
when
i
was
reading
that
provision,
it
wasn't
clear
to
me
that
it
applied
in
this
situation
anywhere...
was
there
any
finding
about
what
that
stop
order,
and
some
other
suggestions
you
had,
would
do?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
the
law
itself
said
that
this
is
the
only
remedy
that
the
remedy
of
the
prime
or
its
assignee
suing
was
the
only
remedy,
was
the
exclusive
remedy.
unknown
speaker
wasn't
there
some...
aren't
there
some
words
in
the
labor
code
to
that
effect?
unknown
speaker
well,
that,
you
told
us,
says
that
the
assignment
is
deemed
in
law
to
have
occurred.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
there
something
in
the
labor
code
involved
in
this
very
complex
of
statutes
that
says
that
that
action
by
the
prime
or
its
assignee
is
the
only
remedy?
