mr.
robert
s.
smith
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
my
first
task
here
is
to
show
you
that
what
the
texas
court
did
was
contrary
to
or
an
unreasonable
application
of
your
previous
decision
in
penry
in
this
case,
and
i
believe
that
your
decision
in
penry
or
penry
one
as
we
call
it
in
our
brief
was
fairly
clear
in
saying
that
as
to
this
man,
a
retarded
man
like
this
with
a
life
long
history
of
really
gruesome
child
abuse
where
virtually
his
whole
case
is
based
on
the
retardation
and
the
horrible
child
abuse,
that
the
three
questions
of
the
old
texas
statutory
scheme
just
don't
work
or
at
least
they
do
not
work
unless
you
take
the
first
question
which
asks
whether
the
defendant
acted
deliberately
and
give
"deliberately"
a
definition.
it
would
have
to
be
a
rather
unusual
definition
of
deliberately
that
will
tell
the
jury,
contrary
to
the
normal
meaning
of
the
word,
that
you
can
find
that
conduct
resulting
from
child...
from
retardation
maybe
even
from
child
abuse,
although
that's
perhaps
a
stretch,
could
be
a
basis
for
a
finding
that
the
defendant
did
not
act
deliberately.
when
you
summarized
in
grand
v
collins
the
penry
holding,
you
said
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
474
of
506
u.s.
reports,
you
said
that
"in
penry
it
was
impossible
to
give
mitigating
effect
to
penry's
evidence
by
way
of
answering
the
special
issues.
"
"grand
says
that
without
any
qualification.
"
"i
would
assume
that
one
qualification
is
appropriate
because
penry
does
indicate
that
there
is...
that
the
definition
of
deliberately
was
a
possibility
for--
"
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--i
think
that's
clear,
your
honor,
indeed
i
said
it
and
i
thought
i
was
being
clear
when
i
said
it.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
but
i...
but
i
was
not
a
judge,
your
honor,
and
there
is
no
one
of
whom
a
jury
is
likely
to
be
more
skeptical
in
a
situation
like
that
than
defense
counsel.
i
beg
to
differ
with
the
suggestion
that
the
judge
made
it
clear,
and
i
think
it's
the
instruction
that
the
judge
gives
that
has
to
be
clear
for
starters.
i
don't
think
you...
i
don't
think
you
can
rely
on
defense
counsel
or
on
the
jury's
acceptance
of
defense
counsel's
interpretation.
the
instruction
is
at
page--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--i
respectfully
submit
that's
much
less
than
clear,
your
honor,
and
becomes
even
less
clear
if
you
read
the
preceding
sentence.
the
preceding
sentence
says
"if
you
find
that
there
are
any
mitigating
circumstances
in
this
case
you
must
decide
how
much
weight
they
deserve,
if
any,
and
therefore
give
effect
and
consideration
to
them
in
assessing
defendant's
personal
culpability
at
the
time
you
answer
the
special
issue.
"
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i
can
only
respectfully
beg
to
differ,
your
honor,
and
in
doing
so
i'll...
let
me
stress
a
couple
of
phrases.
give
effect
and
consideration
to
the
mitigating
circumstances
at
the
time
you
answer
the
special
issue.
i
respectfully
submit
to
you
that
that
is
impossible.
that
is
as
if
i
said
to
this
court
would
you
please
give
effect
and
consideration
to
estelle
v.
smith
at
the
time
you
resolve
the
penry
issue
in
this
case.
if
i
said
that
i
think
i
would
get
nothing
but
blank
looks
because
i
think
that
is
a
meaningless
statement,
but
it's
identical.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
no,
it
wasn't.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
that
was
a
voir
dire,
that
wasn't
me
actually
your
honor
that
was
a
voir
dire
back
in
march.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
done
by
joe
price,
who's
a
very
able
man
but
he
was
doing
it
back
in
march
and
the
jury
didn't
deliberate
until
july.
i
know
of
no
case
where
the
court
has
held
that
an
improper
instruction
or
even
an
ambiguous
instruction
was
clarified
by
voir
dire
questions
asked
four
months
previously
or
by
voir
dire
questions.
i
don't
think
that
works.
the
prosecutor
did
not,
neither
mr.
price
nor
his
colleague,
they
did
not
say
in
their
closing
argument,
they
did
not
reinforce
what
i
had
said
to
the
jury.
they
did
not
differ
from
it,
they
did
not
reinforce
it.
they
chose
to
remain
silent
and
get
whatever
benefit
they
could
get
out
of
what
i
think
is
an
extraordinarily
confusing
situation.
to
me
the
important
fact
was
not
the...
not
defense
counsel's
argument,
but
the
jury
one
might
expect
would
pay
somewhat
more
attention
to
is
the
piece
of
paper
that
they
were
handed
to
write
their
verdict
on
from
the
court
which
was
identical
100
percent
verbatim
identical
with
the
piece
of
paper
they
were
handed
in
penry
one
and
which
said
in
it
as
part
of
the
instructions
as...
or
actually
as
part
of
the
verdict
form,
there's
nothing
about
mitigating
evidence
on
that
piece
of
paper
but
there
is
something
that
says
if
you
want
to
answer
no,
it
has
to
be
because
there's
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
i
believe
it's
the
facts
pertaining
or
the
evidence
pertaining
to
the
special
issue.
in
other
words
they
had
to
find
that
there
was
reasonable
doubt
as
to
whether
the
state
had
proved--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--you
certainly
do
and
i
believe
it's
at
676
of
the
joint
appendix.
if
that's
not
it,
it's
close.
yes,
that's
where
it
is.
the
question
is
to...
to
vote
no
to
any
question
the
foreperson
had
to
sign
a
statement
that
said
"we
the
jury
because
at
least
ten
jurors
have
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
the
matter
inquired
about
in
this
special
issue
find
and
determine
that
the
answer
to
this
special
issue
is
no.
"
"the
matter
inquired
about
in
this
special
issue
had
nothing
to
do
with
mitigating
evidence.
"
"they
were
supposed
to
understand
from
what
i
submit
with
all
due
respect,
justice
scalia,
is
a
very
obscure
instruction
however
lucidly
explained
by
a
defense
lawyer
who
they
did
not
have
to
trust
that
a...
they
had
to
understand
that
those
words
that
i
just
read
did
not
mean
what
they
said,
and
i
think
that
that
is
not
reasonable
to
ask
of
a
jury.
"
mr.
robert
s.
smith
well,
what
is...
a
number
of
things
i
think
are
confusing
about
it
including
the
extraordinary
fact
that
it
doesn't
give
them
any
hint
which
one
to
pick,
but
the
words
i
would
focus
on
are
most
strongly--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--i
submit
it
would
have
been
significantly
less
confusing
if
they
had
indeed
put
a
fourth
question
on
the
piece
of
paper
your
honor,
but
i
also
want
to
call
your
attention
in
the
instruction
to
the
words
"as
reflected
by
a
negative
finding
to
the
issue
under
consideration.
"
i
suggest
to
you
that
those
words,
if
they
have
any
meaning
at
all,
if
the
possible
defense
of
them
is
if
they
have
no
meaning
at
all,
that's
the
best
that
can
be
said
for
them,
but
if
they
have
a
meaning
they
mean
that
you
cannot
give
effect
to
the
mitigating
evidence
unless
you
can
reflect
it
to...
i
mean
a
negative
finding
to
the
issue
under
consideration,
whatever
that
is.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
there
was
no
fourth
question.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i
figure
it
was
not
so
clear
especially
if
they
do
not
necessarily
take
defense
counsel's
word
unsupported
by
the
prosecutor--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--i
don't
think
he
had
authority.
i
think
you'd
already
done
that
for
him
your
honor?
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i
think
it's
fair
to
characterize
what
you
did
in
penry
and
penry
one,
justice
scalia,
as
holding
the
texas
statute
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
penry
and
when
the
statute
is
held
unconstitutional
of
course
the
state
court
on
retrial
need
not
observe
it.
there
was
the
escape
hatch
if
it
was
one
of
giving
a
definition
of
the
word
deliberately.
i
have
no
idea,
i
cannot
imagine
why
the
trial
court
did
not
do
that
or
why
the
prosecution
did
not
suggest
that
they
do
that,
but
they
didn't.
that...
i
admit
that
that's
not
without
its
difficulties
but
the
suggestion--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--yes
we
did,
your
honor.
we
actually
asked
for
two
definitions
of
deliberately.
there's
one
that's
in
the
appendix
the
joint
appendix
and
i
think
i
realize
in
going
over
it
i
think
maybe
the
better
one
is
the
one
that's
not
in
the
joint
appendix.
there
are
two
definitions
of
deliberately;
request
for
instruction
number
11
which
is
not
in
the
appendix
but
it's
in
volume
three
of
the
record
at
107172
is
an
attempt,
and
it's
moot
whether
it
would
have
been
successful,
to
use
the
jury
instruction
to
cure
the
penry
problem.
we
also...
we
also
proposed
several
instructions
that
would...
well
i
think
one
that
would
have
given
a
fourth
question,
one
that
would
at
least
have
said
in
plain
english
nullify,
give
a
false
answer,
you
don't
have
to
tell
the
truth
in
response
to
these
questions.
i
think
if
the
judge
had
done
that,
i
think
he
runs
into
problems
under
roberts
against
louisiana.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
it
is
true
that
roberts
was...
depended
in
part
on
the
capriciousness,
but
the
thrust
of
roberts
i
think
is
that
it's
intolerable
to
tell
the
jury
to
disregard
what
they
are
being
told
to
do.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
as
i
understand
what
the
state
was
contending
in
roberts
is
not
that
dissimilar
from
what
the
state
is
contending
here.
the
state
was
saying
sure
we
could
give
effect
to
mitigating
evidence.
we
have
all
these
proposed
verdicts
and
we
tell
them
that
they
can
render
a
false
one
if
they
want
to.
that's
exactly
what
the
state's
arguing.
that's
what
they
propose
to
do
here.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
well
it...
in
roberts
as
i
understand
the
argument
that
was
rejected
in
roberts,
no
one
was...
no
one
was
saying
oh,
there's
no
problem
with
the
statute
because
the
jury
can
do
whatever
it
wants.
they
were
saying
yes
we
can
give
individualized
consideration
to
individual
offenders.
we
do
it
in
this
perhaps
rather
unusual
way
by
having
the
jury
give
false
answers.
and
the
court
said
that's
not
an
acceptable
way
of
doing
it.
that's
my
reading
of
roberts.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
that's
right.
i
don't
think
we
got
a
nullification
instruction.
i'm
not
sure
what
position
my
adversaries
are
going
to
take.
i've
read
their
brief
and
i
don't
know
what
their
position
is
on
whether
we
got
that
instruction.
the--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--yes,
and
it
is...
it
is
in
the
joint
appendix
and
it
is
cited
in
my
brief,
i
do
not
have
the...
i
can
find
it
pretty
quickly.
i
think
i
can.
if
not
i
will
defer
your
honor's...
it's
in
the
third
volume
of
the
appendix.
it
is
at
page
669,
and
i
would
say
your
honor
that...
if
the
question
is
whether
that
particular
instruction
would
have
cured
the
penry
error,
i
would
have
to
answer
no.
that
one
would
not
have.
i
think
the
other
one
we
proposed
might
or
might
not
have.
it's
moot
because
we
didn't
get
any
of
them.
if
the
question
is
whether
we
proposed
things
that
would
have
cured
the
penry
error,
it's
very
clear
the
answer
is
yes.
we
did
it
this
way,
we
did
it
the
other
way,
we
did
it...
there
are
plenty
of
proposed
instructions
that
we
think
could
have
complied
with
penry.
the
court
gave
none
of
them.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
no,
no,
was
it
on
paper?
it
certainly
had
not
been
enacted
and
as
far
as
i
know
did
not
exist,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
s.
smith
under
the
new
statute,
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i
think
so,
your
honor.
i
am
not
above
trying
to
think
of
a
way
to--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--i
don't
think
i
have...
i
don't
think
i--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--yes,
yes
and
i
would...
while
i
might
not
give
it
up,
i
would
have
a
tough
time
saying
that
penry
was
not
complied
with
under
the
new
texas
procedure.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
he
did
not
say
that.
one
can
infer
that's
what
he
believed
your
honor.
he
did
not
say
anything.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i'm
not
aware
of
such
a
suggestion,
justice
kennedy.
i
do
submit
respectfully
the
answer
to
your
previous
question
is
clear
enough
although
it's
unfortunate
when
a
judge
is
sitting
with
the
united
states
supreme
court
saying
one
thing
and
the
texas
legislature
saying
another.
the
court
wins.
he
has
to
follow
what
this
court
says.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i
guess
i
would
answer
by
saying
if
the
texas
statute
has
been
held
unconstitutional
as
applied
then
it's
perfectly
appropriate
for
a
texas
judge
not
to
implement
it.
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
that.
let
me
try
to
talk
briefly
about
my
second
task,
if
i
can,
which
is
to
show
that
the...
this
peebles
psychiatric
report
was
contrary
to
or
an
unreasonable
application
of
this
court's
decision
in
estelle
v
smith.
based
on
the
briefs
i
think
that
issue
is
going
to
boil
down
to
whether
the
peebles
report
was
the
sort
of
rebuttal
that
is
permitted
under
buchanan
against
kentucky.
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
it
is
not.
the
peebles
report
which
is
at
page
60
of
the
joint
appendix
served
one
function
in
this
case
for
the
prosecution
and
that
was
to
introduce
one
sentence
which
says
it
is...
"it
is
my
further
professional
opinion
that
if
johnny
paul
penry
were
released
from
custody
that
he
would
be
dangerous
to
other
persons.
"
that
is
the
heart
of
that...
that
statement
is
summarizes
perfectly
what
the
state
was
trying
to
prove
on
its
affirmative
case
of
future
dangerousness.
on
that
issue
the
defendant
produced
no
mental
status
evidence,
no
psychiatric
evidence
and
there
was
no
occasion
for
rebuttal.
they
didn't
rebut
anything
we
said.
that
is,
no...
no
court
below
by
the
way
found
that
it
was
rebuttal.
the
theories
of
the
courts
below
are
so
weak
that
as
i
read
my
adversary's
briefs
they
do
not
defend
the
theories
of
the
courts
below.
the
state
does
and
its
allied
amici
do
at
some
length
argue
harmless
error.
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
think
an
error
was
harmless
or
the
admission
of
a
piece
of
evidence
was
harmless
when
you
look
at
what
the
prosecution
did
with
that
piece
of
evidence,
and
that
is
at
page
7
of
our
brief.
this
is
the
last
page,
the
last
paragraph
of
the
prosecution's
rebuttal
summation.
this
is
the
climax,
this
is
what
he
saved
to
have
ringing
in
the
jury's
ears
when
they
went
out
to
deliberate.
"he
was
examined
by
doctor
felix
peebles
who
found
that
he
was
sane.
"
"he
knew
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
and
he
was
competent
to
stand
trial.
"
but
doctor
peebles
went
on
and
made
an
additional
finding
that
was
really
out
of
the
ordinary
and
i
have
never
seen
this
in
any
kind
of
a
report.
i'm
quoting
the
prosecutor,
closing
out.
he
just
added
it,
he
said
that
the
question
of
course
comes
why...
why
did
the
state
love
that
report
so
much?
they
say
and
they're
right
the
dangerousness
was
not
a
tough
issue
for
them,
but
i
think
the
curt
must
remember
that
the
jury
wasn't
just
answering
yes
or
no
to
the
second
issue.
under
your
decision
in
penry
the
jury
had
to
take
into
account
had
to
weigh
the
mitigating
evidence
against
the
perfectly
horrible
and
very
real
evidence
of
man's
dangerousness.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
it
was
a
very
tough
and
very
close
case
because
the--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--it
was
a
close
case
on
how
you
come
out
at
the
end
when
you
consider
that
there's
a
ton
of
mitigating
evidence
and
also
very
serious
evidence
of
dangerousness.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
it
doesn't
have
to
your
honor,
i
do
not...
i
can
only
refer
your
honor
to
the
record
on
this.
the
record
of
the
mental
retardation
and
the
child
abuse
is
as
appalling
as
you
could
want.
if
you
browse
through
about
pages
139
to
219
of
the
record
which
is
the
testimony
on
the
child
abuse,
it
is
the
most
painful
reading
you'll
ever...
you'll
ever
have
in
your
life.
this
was
first
of
all
it's
a
retarded
man
but
it's
a
retarded
child
whose
mother
beat
him
physically,
abused
him
verbally,
humiliated
him
in
the
most
revolting
ways.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i
beg
to
differ.
of
course
it
would
not
affect
the
jury's
determination
of
how
culpable
he
was
but
the
jury
had
the
power
to
decide
i
don't
care
how
much
abuse
he
had
and
how
much
retardation
he
had.
i
don't
feel
safe
with
this
man
still
alive.
they
had
the
power
to
make
that
decision.
that's
the
decision
the
prosecutor
was
asking
them
to
make.
that's
why
dangerousness
was
the
prosecutor's
big
point
and
the
peebles
report
was
the
prosecutor's
big
exhibit.
if
you
read
the
prosecutor's
summation
he
clearly
thought--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--there
was
indeed
but
this
was
the
one
he
liked
best.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i
think
it
does,
your
honor,
because
i
do
think
it
was
important
not
just
whether
the
jury
thought
he
was
dangerousness...
dangerous
but
whether...
but
how
disturbed
the
jury
was
by
the
dangerousness.
i
think
the
degree
of
dangerousness
and
the
impact
it
had
was
terribly
important
at
the
trial.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
one...
one
sentence
which...
it
is
a
sentence
which
as
the
prosecutor
points
out
appears
to
have
been
stuck
in
there
by
this
professional,
this
uncross
examined
professional
with
no
axe
to
grind
who
from
reading
the
report
you
would
think
he
took
one
look
at
the
man
and
said
this
man
is
so
dangerous
i've
got
to
volunteer
it
to
the
court.
i
don't
know
if
that's
what
really
happened
but
that's
what
the
prosecutor
suggested
to
the
jury.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i'm
not
saying
it
can't
be
looked
at
but
i
think
to
decide
whether
it's
harmless
you
have
to
say
how
different
is
the
case
without
it,
different
enough
that
the
prosecutor
would
not
have
had
this
key
point.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
well
we
think
it
was
your
honor.
i
think
the
argument
the
main
argument
against
that
it
wasn't
estelle
error
is
buchanan
against
kentucky
and
i've
tried
to
show
this
certainly
wasn't
rebuttal,
they
weren't
rebutting
anything.
there
are
other
theories
and
i
think
they're
very
very
very
tenuous
indeed
it's
not
even
clear
from
my
adversary's
briefs
that
they
believe.
if
i
may,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
thank
you.
let
me...
i'm
going
to
try
to
use
that
time
just
to
try
to
convey
some
information
on
some
points
that
may
be
of
interest.
on
the
question
of
what
a
texas
court
could
have
done
my
texas
colleague
advises
me
that
there
was
a
case
called
mcpherson
in
which
a
texas
court
before
the
statute
was
amended
did
give
a
fourth
special
issue
and
that
that
was
ultimately
upheld
by
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals.
that
had
not
occurred
at
the
time
of
our
trial
but
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
did
approve
it.
there
was
an
escape
hatch
available
and
it
was
used.
i
do
not
have
the
citation
to
the
mcpherson
case
here;
if
there's
an
appropriate
way
to
provide
it
we'll
certainly
do
that.
secondly
on
the
question
of...
i
learned
to
say
voir
dire
when
i
was
in
texas
and
i'm
trying
to
unlearn
it,
but
it's
one
or
the
other
voir
dire
or
voir
dire.
i
suggest
that
it
is
perilous
to
rely
on
voir
dire
of
all
things
to
undo
or
to
cure
a
problem
with
an
instruction.
mr.
taylor
is
quite
right,
that
this
process
in
texas
goes
on
for
weeks
and
weeks
and
a
lot
of
things
get
said.
if
you'll
look
at
volume
22
page
1792
of
the
record,
you
will
see
one
of
the
jurors,
one
of
the
jurors
who
actually
sat
being
instructed
by
the
prosecutors,
you
should
not
automatically
answer
these
questions
a
certain
way
to
achieve
a
punishment,
you
should
not
answer
one
of
them
no
because
i
want
him
to
get
a
life
sentence.
possibly
technically
correct
but
surely
in
the
context
of
what
these
jurors
were
supposed
to
do,
likely
to
confuse,
my
point
is
simply
a
lot
of
things
get
said
in
voir
dire
over
a
long
time
and
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
say
that
that
cured
what
i
think
is
a
hopelessly
confusing
instruction.
on
the
peebles
report
where
mr.
taylor
made
the
argument
that
what
they
were
really
trying
to
show
was
that
penry
was
a
psychopath,
i
have
a
very
short
response.
the
peebles
report
doesn't
say
that.
there's
nothing
in
the
peebles
report
that
says
he's
a
psychopath.
sure
they
said
it;
everybody
else
said
it.
peebles
said
pretty
much
what
our
expert
said,
he
said
he
has
mental
retardation
and
anti
social
conduct,
but
antisocial
personality
disorder,
you
won't
find
that
in
the
peebles
report.
unless
there
are
further
questions
i'll
submit.
