justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
in
1989,
we
held
that
the
petitioner
johnny
paul
penry
had
been
sentenced
to
death
in
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment.
although
penry
had
offered
extensive
evidence
that
he
was
mentally
retarded
and
had
been
severely
abused
as
a
child,
his
jury
was
never
instructed
that
it
could
consider
and
give
effect
to
that
mitigating
evidence
in
determining
his
sentence.
the
jury
in
that
first
trial
was
instructed
to
answer
three
special
issues:
whether
penry
had
acted
deliberately;
whether
he
would
be
a
future
danger;
and
whether
he
had
unreasonably
responded
to
any
provocation.
we
found
that
none
of
those
special
was
issues
was
broad
enough
to
encompass
penry’s
mitigating
evidence
and
concluded
that
a
reasonable
juror
could
well
have
believed
that
there
was
no
vehicle
under
those
instructions
for
expressing
the
view
that
penry
did
not
deserves
to
be
sentenced
to
death
based
on
the
mitigating
evidence.
penry
was
retried
then
in
1990
and
again
found
guilty
of
capital
murder.
when
it
came
time
to
submit
the
case
to
the
jury
for
sentencing
that
court
instructed
the
jury
to
determine
penry’s
sentence
by
answering
the
same
three
special
issues
that
were
asked
in
the
first
trial.
the
court
then
gave
a
supplemental
instruction,
telling
the
jury
that
“if
you
determine
when
giving
effect
to
the
mitigating
evidence,
that
a
life
sentence
is
reflected
by
a
negative
finding
to
the
special
issue
under
consideration
is
appropriate,
a
negative
finding
should
be
given
to
one
of
the
special
issues”.
the
jury
answered
“yes”
to
each
of
the
special
issue
question
and
the
trial
court
sentenced
penry
to
death.
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
affirmed
the
convection
and
sentence.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
dismissed
penry’s
federal
habeas
petition.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
penry
claims
initially
that
the
admission
at
the
sentencing
hearing,
a
report
of
a
dr.
peebles
about
a
mental
examination
of
penry
in
1977
violated
his
fifth
amendment
privileges
and
that
this
is
case
indistinguishable
from
our
holding
in
the
case
of
estelle
versus
smith.
like
justice
souter,
i
am
not
going
to
orally
explain
this
part
of
our
opinion
today.
suffice
to
say
that
because
the
case
is
here
on
writ
of
habeas
corpus
we
need
to
decide
only
whether
the
state
court’s
decision
to
admit
evidence
from
dr.
peebles
report
was
contrary
to
or
an
unreasonable
application
of
our
precedent,
we
hold
that
it
was
not.
there
are
several
factual
differences
between
this
case
and
the
case
of
the
estelle
versus
smith,
and
estelle
itself
suggested
that
its
holding
was
limited
to
the
distinct
circumstances
presented
there.
the
state
court’s
conclusion
that
the
jury
instructions
at
penry's
resentencing
provided
an
adequate
vehicle
for
the
jury
to
give
effect
to
penry’s
mitigation
evidence,
however
we
hold
was
objectively
unreasonable.
the
three
special
issues
submitted
to
the
jury
were
identical
to
the
once
found
inadequate
in
the
first
penry
case.
although,
the
supplemental
instruction
mentioned
medicating
evidence,
the
mechanism
it
purported
to
create
for
the
jurors
to
give
effect
to
that
evidence
was
ineffective
and
illogical.
the
jury
was
instructed
that
a
"yes"
answer
to
a
special
issue
was
appropriate
only
when
supported
by
the
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
that
a
"no"
answer
was
appropriate
only
when
there
was
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
whether
the
answer
should
be
"yes".
the
supplemental
instruction
in
effect
told
the
jury
to
ignore
the
clear
guidelines
and
change
a
truthful
“yes”
answer
to
one
of
the
questions
to
an
untruthful
“no”
answer
in
order
to
give
effect
to
a
decision
not
to
impose
the
death
sentence.
the
supplemental
instruction
placed
law-abiding
jurors
in
a
difficult
situation.
the
comments
of
the
prosecutor,
the
defense
counsel,
and
the
trial
court
did
little
to
clarify
this
confusion
we
think.
any
realistic
assessment
of
the
manner
in
which
the
supplemental
instruction
operated
leads
to
the
same
conclusion
we
reached
in
first
penry
case.
a
reasonable
juror
could
well
have
believed
there
was
no
proper
vehicle
for
expressing
the
view
that
penry
did
not
deserve
to
be
sentenced
to
death
based
on
the
mitigating
evidence.
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
on
this
point
is
therefore
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
resentencing.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part,
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia
have
joined.
