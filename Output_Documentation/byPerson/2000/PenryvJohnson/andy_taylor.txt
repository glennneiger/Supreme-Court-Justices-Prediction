mr.
andy
taylor
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
unlike
penry
one,
where
no
instruction
was
given
this
case
involves
an
instruction
that
was
not
only
given
but
said
in
its
express
words
that
this
jury
could
give
effect
to
a
moral
determination
of
this
man's
personal
culpability
such
that
if
they
felt
despite
literal
answers
to
the
three
questions
that
texas
submits
that
a
life
choice
instead
of
death
was
the
appropriate
reasoned
moral
response,
then
answer
one
or
more
of
those
questions
no.
mr.
andy
taylor
we
submit
that
it
is
not
awkward
because
of
the
actual
words
contained
in
the
instruction
as
justice
scalia
read
out
loud
in
that
particular
instruction
that
was
given,
and
i
might
add,
justice
ginsburg,
that
instruction
was
attached
to
the
three
submission
charge
that
went
back
in
the
jury
room.
it
wasn't
something
that
was
said
verbally
and
never
seen
again
in
writing
but
once
that
instruction
was
put
together,
it
made
clear
that
to
give
a
vehicle
to
this
jury
to
choose
life
instead
of
death
it
could
answer
no
even
if
they
felt
that
it
would
be
a
literally
an
answer
of
yes.
mr.
andy
taylor
i
think
that
was
the
point
of
penry
one--
mr.
andy
taylor
--i
agree
and
what
you
taught
us
your
honor
in
sapple
is
that
while
we
must
channel
and
limit
the
discretion
that
a
sentencing
jury
has
in
finding
out
if
a
defendant
is
eligible
for
the
death
penalty,
it
is
not
unconstitutional
to
shape
and
to
structure
that
jury's
consideration
of
all
of
the
evidence
so
that
they
can
make
a
life
choice.
mr.
andy
taylor
any
of
those
three
would
be
constitutional.
this
court
has
never
told
the
state
of
texas
that
in
structuring
and
shaping
the
jury's
consideration
of
all
of
the
relevant
consideration
of
evidence
including
mitigating
evidence,
it
must
choose
a
particular
way
to--
mr.
andy
taylor
--we
think
that
it
was
a
reasonable
choice
and
certainly
a
reasonable
application
under
the
edpa
standard
for
this
trial
judge
to
pick
an
instruction
as
opposed
to
a
fourth
question.
first,
penry
one
tells
us
to
use
an
instruction.
it
doesn't
tell
us
to
use
a
question.
second
the
submission
that
state
law
allowed
at
that
time
asked
for
three
questions,
not
four.
there
was
no
appellate
decision
in
texas
suggesting
that
a
fourth
question
was
appropriate.
mr.
andy
taylor
we
do
not
concede
that
point,
justice
scalia.
mr.
andy
taylor
we
do
not.
mr.
andy
taylor
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
might
add--
mr.
andy
taylor
--in
penry
one
although
it
was
not
clearly
established
under
the
edpa
standard
that
confronts
this
court,
the
court
did
say
that
there
was
no
instruction
on
mitigating
or
rather
on
deliberateness
so
the
court--
mr.
andy
taylor
--we
respectfully
disagree.
mr.
andy
taylor
we
do
not.
what
penry
one
taught
us
is
that--
mr.
andy
taylor
--what
penry
one
taught
us--
mr.
andy
taylor
--it's
not
been
reversed
but
sapple
and
buchanan
and
other
cases
teach
us
that
there
must
be
an
instruction.
once
you
get
an
instruction
then
we
go
through
a
boyd
analysis
of
whether
or
not
the
instruction
got
the
job
done.
the
instruction
that
you
referenced
on
deliberateness
that
defense
counsel
requested
is
in
your
joint
appendix
volume
three
page
669,
and
in
that
instruction
there
is
not
one
reference
made
to
mitigating
evidence.
that
couldn't
have
got
the
job
done.
it
was
a
reasonable
decision
on
the
part
of
the
texas
courts.
mr.
andy
taylor
no,
we
are
not,
your
honor,
but
the
point
is--
mr.
andy
taylor
--well
the
point
that
we're
making
is
that
in
order
for
an
instruction
on
deliberateness
to
work
under
penry
one
and
the
cases
thereafter,
it
would
have
to
direct
the
jury's
attention
to
the
mitigating
evidence.
that
instruction
doesn't
get
it
done.
what
instruction
was
given
specifically
tells
them
that
they
have
the
power
to
answer
no
instead
of
yes
and
i
might
add
under
boyd
that
case
taught
us
that
in
determining
if
the
instruction
was
erroneous
or
ambiguous
that
we
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
we
don't
parse
and
make--
mr.
andy
taylor
--because
the
instruction
told
them
to.
the
instruction
specifically
says
if
you
determine
when
giving
mitigating
effect
to
the
mitigating
evidence
if
any
that
a
life
sentence
as
reflected
by
a
negative
finding
as
to
the
issue
under
consideration
rather
than
a
death
sentence--
mr.
andy
taylor
--we
submit
that
it
is
not
flatly
inconsistent.
in
fact
it
is
entirely
consistent
because
what
you
taught
us
in
boyd
is
that
you
must
look
at
all
of
the
charge,
not
only
a
certain
section
to
answer
the
question--
mr.
andy
taylor
--the
charge
and
the
accompanying
instructions
is
found
in
volume
three
of
the
joint
appendix
beginning
at
page
672,
justice
ginsburg,
and
that
charge
does
a
couple
of
things.
it
not
only
tells
the
jury
to
take
into
consideration
all
of
the
evidence
but
it
goes
further
and
it
tells
them
that
they
should
look
at
all
of
the
mitigating
circumstances
and
including
in
that
look
at
the
defendant's
character,
record,
circumstances
of
the
crime,
and
then
they
have
to
look
at
a
broader
principle
and
that
is
what
is
this
defendant's
personal
culpability
not
limiting
it
to
only
the
question
of
deliberateness
or
future
dangerousness
or
provocation--
mr.
andy
taylor
--it's
stapled
together,
your
honor.
this
is
an
actual
copy
of
what
went
back
to
the
jury
room
and
it's
stapled
on
the
front.
they
would
have
to
had
read
it
and
of
course
it
was
read
aloud
to
them
during
the
trial.
this
was
a
six
week
voir
dire.
mr.
andy
taylor
you
must
follow
your
oath.
the
oath
includes
the
instruction
and
under
that
circumstance
morally
if
you
believe
life
instead
of
death
is
the
right
answer,
you
answer
no.
mr.
andy
taylor
you
were
told
under
those
circumstances
to
answer
no.
not
only
does
the
instruction
say
that.
the
trial
court
during
voir
dire
said
that
and
i
quote.
this
is
from
the
record
and
it's
volume
27.
the
trial
court
is
telling
one
of
the
members
of
the
voir
dire
panel
that
was
eventually
chosen
question
okay,
"and
do
you
see
from
reading
this
instruction
that
if
based
on
all
the
evidence
you
heard
in
this
trial
if
you
felt
that
these
questions
should
be
answered
yes
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt--
"
mr.
andy
taylor
"but
you
still
felt
that
there
was
mitigating
evidence
that
had
been
presented
to
you
that
was
sufficient
for
you
to
feel
that
in
this
case
the
death
sentence
was
not
appropriate
and
a
life
sentence
was
more
appropriate,
then
you
could
answer
one
or
more
of
the
questions
no
to
effect
a
life
sentence.
"
"do
you
understand
that?
"
the
answer
was
yes.
on
pages
18
and
19
of
our
brief,
the
red
brief,
we
cite
voir
dire
references
for
every
single
one
of
those
jurors
that
made
it
in
the
case.
it
was
a
six
week
voir
dire
on
average
over
two
hours
was
spent
going
over
one
thing
and
that
was
this
instruction.
this
instruction
was
in
writing
and
showed
to
the
panel
during
voir
dire.
and
what
we
learned--
mr.
andy
taylor
--statements
by
the
prosecutor
were
made
in
each
and
every
instance.
statements
by
the
court
were
made
in
some
instances.
statements
by
defense
counsel
were
made
in
each
instance
and
so--
mr.
andy
taylor
--it
was
the
instruction,
the
actual
instruction--
mr.
andy
taylor
--i
don't
have
the
blue
brief
handy.
mr.
andy
taylor
yes.
the
only
difference,
your
honor,
between
the
instruction
during
voir
dire
and
the
instruction
that
went
back
with
the
jury
is
that
the
instruction
in
voir
dire
said
that
special
issue
and
what
our
opponent
described
as
a
slight
improvement
to
the
charge
ultimately
it
said
"one
or
more
of
the
special
issues.
"
that's
the
only
nuance
that's
different.
mr.
andy
taylor
we
think
not.
nullification
to
the
extent
that
we're
talking
about
roberts
versus
louisiana
is
a
situation
where
a
juror
is
tempted
and
invited
by
the
charge
to
breach
their
oath.
here
the
juror
was
not
tempted
to
breach
their
oath
was
admonished
to
follow
their
oath.
now
it's
true
that
the
lower
courts
and
the
high
court
in
texas
referred
to
it
as
a
nullification
charge
but
there's
that
key
distinction
because
they're
following
their
oath
and
doing
exactly
what
you
told
us
in
the
opinion
you
authored
for
this
court
in
penry
one.
as
to
the--
mr.
andy
taylor
--well
as
a
matter
of
texas
law
they
did
use
the
word
nullification
but
in
a
proper
way.
that's
not
a
bad
word
under
texas
law.
that
is
a
good
word
because
if
it's
a
nullification
instruction,
the
high
court
in
texas,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
has
told
us
that
complies
rather
than
violates
roberts
and
complies
and
rather
than
violating
penry.
as
my
time
draws
near
i'd
like
to
focus
on
the
estelle
claim
that
was
made
in
this
case.
mr.
andy
taylor
under
the
estelle
claim
what
was
clearly
established
and
remembering
of
course
that
we're
on
federal
habeas
review,
edpa
standard
applies,
what
was
clearly
demonstrated
in
estelle,
two
things,
first
that
request
for
an
examination
of
the
defendant
was
not
made
by
the
defendant
or
his
counsel
but
rather
was
ordered
by
the
court.
second,
in
estelle
we
learned
that
there
was
no
attempt
at
all
to
introduce
the
mind
set
or
the
psychiatric
evidence
in
that
case,
and
so
it
was
a
reasonable
application
of
estelle
for
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
texas
to
rule
that
estelle
was
distinguishable
and
not
clearly
applicable
to
this
case.
in
this
case
not
only
are
we
dealing
with
a
request
by
defense
counsel,
we're
also
dealing
with
offensive
use
of
psychiatric
evidence
by
defense
counsel.
you'll
note
in
the
record
when
dr.
price,
their
expert
witness
on
mental
retardation
and
child
abuse
and
its
effects,
he
testified
that
he
relied
on
the
doctor
peebles
report.
that's
a
choice
the
defense
made,
not
a
choice
that
the
prosecution
made.
mr.
andy
taylor
of
course,
we
contend
that
estelle
is
not
applicable
but
if
you
believe
that
buchanan
applies
and
the
only
way
that
we
can
win
is
to
argue
that
it's
solely
and
exclusively
rebuttal,
the
answer
to
that
question
that
demonstrates
why
we
still
prevail
and
why
the
court
below
was
correct
is
that
in
the
peebles
report
there
is
a
statement
made
that
the
reason
that
this
gentleman
doesn't
learn
from
his
mistakes
is
not
because
of
mental
retardation,
not
because
of
child
abuse
but
rather
because
he
is
a
psychotic
individual.
he
has
an
antisocial
personality
disorder.
he's
a
psychopath
and
so
therefore
it's
very
important
in
determining
personal
culpability
and
whether
he
should
get
death
instead
of
life
to
be
able
to
demonstrate
from
the
prosecution's
point
of
view
this
man
is
not
any
less
culpable
because
his
violent
behavior,
his
future
dangerousness
is
not
the
result
of
mental
retardation.
it's
the
result
of
the
fact
that
he's
a
psychopath
and
therefore
he
is
not
any
less
culpable
than
any
one
else
absent
such
evidence
of
mitigating
circumstances.
and
justice
ginsburg,
it
is
for
that
reason
that
we
still
prevail
even
if
you
believe
that
under
buchanan
and
its
rebuttal
exception
that
is
all
that
we
have
here.
mr.
andy
taylor
well
the
first
part
of
our
argument
we're
saying
is
estelle
doesn't
apply
on
its
facts,
that
as
to
the
buchanan
exception,
we're
suggesting
and
the
question
i
believe
was
what
part
of
the
report
would
be
rebuttal
to
what
they
were
saying
in
the
punishment
phase,
what
dr.
price
was
saying
is
that
i'm
not
focusing
on
the
future
dangerousness
part
but
what
dr.
price
was
saying
is
we
don't
think
he's
culpable
and
the
reason
we
don't
think
he's
culpable
is
because
he
can't
control
himself,
he
can't
learn
from
his
mistakes,
but
that--
