we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
<oh
oh

[=00-6677],
john
paul
penry
versus
gary
johnson.
mr.
smith?
unknown
speaker
it
was
impossible
there
under
the
instructions
that
were
there
given,
but
the
instructions
here
given
made
it
very
clear
that
if
you
considered
the
mental
deficiency
to
be
a
mitigating
factor
you
should
answer
one
of
the
three
questions
"no".
in
defense's
closing
argument
he
said
the
following,
i
don't
understand
how
the
jury
could
have
misunderstood
it.
"let
me
try
to
simplify
it.
"
"if
when
you
thought
about
mental
retardation
and
the
child
abuse
you
think
that
this
guy
deserves
a
life
sentence
and
not
a
death
sentence,
decide
life
imprisonment
is
punishment
enough
then
you've
got
to
answer
one
of
those
questions
no.
"
"the
judge
has
not
told
you
which
question
and
you
have
to
give
that
answer
even
if
you
decide
the
literally
correct
answer
is
yes.
"
"not
the
easiest
instruction
to
follow
and
the
law
does
funny
things
sometimes
but
it
is
what
it
says
and
i've
taken
all
this
time
with
you
to
make
sure
you
understand
what
it
says.
"
that's
pretty
clear
to
me.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
were
imminently
clear.
unknown
speaker
how
about
this
sentence:
if
you
determine
when
giving
mitigating
effect
to
the
mitigating
evidence,
if
any,
that
a
life
sentence
as
reflected
by
a
negative
finding
to
the
issue
under
consideration
rather
than
a
death
sentence
is
an
appropriate
response
to
the
personal
culpability
of
the
defendant,
a
negative
finding
should
be
given
to
one
of
the
special
issues.
unknown
speaker
right,
and
then
the
next
sentence
explains
just
what
he
means
by
giving,
in
assessing
the
defendant's
personal
culpability.
it
says
"an
appropriate
response
to
the
personal
culpability
a
negative
finding
should
be
given
to
one
of
the
special
issues.
"
i
really...
we
assume
the
jury
is...
even
if
the
defendant
is
mentally
deficient
that
the
jury
is
not
and
that...
that
instruction
seems
clear
enough
to--
unknown
speaker
--this
is
also
the
jury
that
you
told
on
i
guess
it
was
you
doing
the
voir
dire
as
well--
unknown
speaker
--now
this
instruction
that
you
got,
this
is
almost
like
a
fourth
issue
in
that
you
will
hear
this
other
evidence
that
comes
in
about
the
defendant,
you
will
take
that
into
consideration
when
you
are
answering
these
three
issues.
unknown
speaker
that
was
pretty
well
done
too
i
thought.
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
the
verdict
form
that
you're
talking
about?
that
would
be
helpful
if
we
could
look
at
it--
unknown
speaker
--what
is
confusing
about
the
instruction
"if
you
determine
when
giving
mitigating
effect
to
the
mitigating
evidence,
if
any,
that
a
life
sentence
as
reflected
by
a
negative
finding
to
the
issue
under
consideration
rather
than
a
death
sentence,
is
an
appropriate
response
to
the
personal
culpability
of
the
defendant,
a
negative
finding
should
be
given
to
one
of
the
special
issues?
"
unknown
speaker
if
it
had
given
them
a
hint
as
to
which
one
to
pick,
you'd
object
to
that,
the
fact
is
that
we
all
acknowledge
as
we
held
in
penry
one,
it
doesn't
naturally
come
under
any
one
of
them
so
the
judge's
instruction
was
the
supreme
court
has
said
this
mitigating
evidence
doesn't
come
under
any
one
of
the
three,
so
in
effect,
as
counsel
said
in
the
voir
dire,
i'm
creating
a
fourth
special
issue
and
if
you
find
mental
incapacity,
say
no
to
any
one
of
the
three
and
i
think
that's
what
this
sentence
says.
unknown
speaker
at
any
rate
the
verdict
form
that
they
got
gave
them
the
three
questions.
it
didn't
contain
this
fourth
question?
unknown
speaker
so
if
a
jury
is
hearing
fleetingly
this
long
instruction
then
gets
a
piece
of
paper
with
three
choices
answer
yes
or
no,
maybe
it's
not
so
clear.
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
have
done
it,
mr.
smith.
do
you
think
the
judge
had
authority
to
override
the
texas
statute
which
only
provided
for
these
three
questions
and
simply
invent
a
fourth
of
his
own?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
think
we
created
a
fourth
question
under
texas
statutory
law.
i
think
what
we
said
is
that
the
mental
incapacity
has
to
be
one
of
the
factors
the
jury
is
allowed
to
take
into
account
and
i
think
it's
a
perfectly
reasonable
way
for
the
judge
to
say
find
no
to
one
of
the
texas
special
issues
in
the
statute,
if
that's...
if
that's
what
you...
what
you
think
is
the
case.
unknown
speaker
did
you
ask
for
that?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
whether
he
runs
into
problems
under
roberts,
because
what
roberts
as
i
have
read
the
opinion
objects
to
is
the
capriciousness,
the
fact
that
the
jury
could
act
with
no
evidence
at
all.
and
here
the
instruction
is
quite
clear
as
to
what
sort
of
evidence
the
jury
would
act
on.
unknown
speaker
roberts
had
a
reason
and
the
reason
that
roberts
gave
why
it
was
intolerable
was
that
the
jury
was
just
invited
on
no
evidence
whatever
to
move
the
offense
downward
which
would
have
been
the
exact
thing
that
furman
objected
to.
unknown
speaker
the
state
is
arguing
that
you
can
respond
to
evidence
which
you
believe
in
this
particular
way.
it
isn't
saying
just,
you
know,
if
you
feel
like...
if
you
just
feel
generally
this
guy
shouldn't
get
the
death
sentence
go
ahead
and
find
another
verdict--
unknown
speaker
--in
any
case
you
didn't
get
that
alternative
instruction
so
we
don't
get
into
roberts,
right?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
you
mentioned
one
instruction
you
proposed
that's
in
the
record
but
not
the
joint
appendix.
was
there
another
one
that's
in
the
joint
appendix?
unknown
speaker
was
the
so
called
penry
instruction
on
paper
at
the
time
of
this
resentencing
hearing,
the
law
that
is
in
effect
in
texas
now?
unknown
speaker
what
happens
if
we
find
for
you
in
this
case?
it
goes
back.
would
this
case,
if
the
state
wishes
to
do
so
be
resubmitted
to
a
jury
under
the
new
statute?
unknown
speaker
and
is
that
okay?
is
that
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
you
haven't
thought
of
one
yet
though.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
you
don't
have
to
commit
yourself,
but
that's
presumably
what
would
happen
or
what
the
state
would
try
to
make
happen.
unknown
speaker
did
the
judge
say
it
was
simply
beyond
his
authority
to
alter
these
three
special
issues?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
what
the
judge
is
supposed
to
do
if
this
court
says
one
thing
and
the
legislature
says
the
other.
obviously,
he
can't
ignore
the
mandate
of
this
court.
on
the
other
hand
i
don't
know
if
he
can
just
hold
the
matter
in
abeyance.
was
there
any
suggestion
that
there
be
a
delay
in
these
proceedings
while
the
legislature
got
its
act
together?
unknown
speaker
in
the
sense
that
the
instructions
as
drafted,
as
legislated,
cannot
be
given,
i'm
not
sure
if
he
has
the
further
authority
to
go
ahead
and
invent
additional
instructions
under
texas
law.
i
just
don't
know.
unknown
speaker
close
case,
on
which
issue?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
of
course
the
evidence
of
dangerousness
is
perhaps
more
precise
than
the
mitigating
evidence.
the
jury
doesn't
have
to
credit
any
particular
evidence
even
though
it
believes
the
witness,
it
doesn't
have
to
believe
that
that
is
mitigating--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
don't
weigh
future
dangerousness
against
that
as
you
put
it.
they
are
two
separate
issues.
that
goes
to
the
issue
of
personal
culpability.
unknown
speaker
and
future
dangerousness
is
a
totally
different
issue.
you
don't
weigh
the
one
against
the
other.
i
don't
see
how
anything
you
said
with
regard
to
his
dangerousness
would
affect
the
jury's
determination
regarding
how
culpable
he
was.
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
other
evidence
of
future
dangerousness.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
fact
that
the
counsel
may
have
used
this
in
his
summation
doesn't
really
go
to
the
harmless
error
question,
if
there's
a
whole
lot
of
other
evidence
as
to
future
dangerousness.
unknown
speaker
one
sentence?
unknown
speaker
but
i
still
don't
see
how
that
means
that
this
one
sentence
is
so
controlling
that
all
the
other
evidence
of
future
dangerousness
can't
be
looked
at
to
decide
whether
it
was
harmless
error.
unknown
speaker
maybe
it
wasn't
an
estelle
v
smith
violation
at
all.
i
mean
i
don't
know...
i'm
not
sure
you
get
into
harmless
error.
maybe
it
wasn't
error.
unknown
speaker
very
well
mr.
smith.
mr.
taylor
we'll
hear
from
you--
unknown
speaker
even
though
literally
they
should
answer
yes.
i
mean
that's
such
an
odd
posture
in
a
sense
it's
very
awkward
to
say
the
least.
unknown
speaker
the
last
colloquy
we
just
had
with
petitioner's
counsel
was
to
the
effect
that
really
evidence
of
child
abuse
and
so
forth
doesn't
relate
to
future
dangerousness--
unknown
speaker
--and
that's
our
whole
concern
here.
unknown
speaker
isn't
the
difficulty
in
this
case
that
what
you
describe
as
the
structure
is
in
effect
an
instruction
that
says
you
may
act
irrationally
and
as
against
that
possibility
there
were
at
least
two
avenues
open
to
the
court
that
would
have
allowed
the
jury
to
do
just
what
penry
one
required
and
to
do
it
in
a
rational
way?
one
way
would
have
been
to
add
a
fourth
question
and
say
"even
though
you
answer
yes
to
one,
two
and
three
you
also
have
a
responsibility
to
consider
mitigating
evidence
and
if
you
do
so,
you
may
in
fact
answer
this
fourth
question.
"
however
it
might
be
structured
"in
a
way
that
says
don't
impose
the
death
penalty
any
way.
"
a
second
rational
way
to
do
it...
i
don't
how
easy
it
would
have
been
but
i
assume
it
could
have
been
done,
would
have
been
with
a
definition
of
deliberately
and
the
question
the
second
question
i
guess,
which
instructed
the
jury
that
a
person
of
some
degree
of
retardation
simply
does
not...
is
not
capable
of
the
mental
process
that
"deliberately"
assumes
or
requires.
so
what
it
boils
down
to
is
the
state
had
at
least
two
ways
in
which
penry
could
rationally
have
been
given
consideration,
and
instead
the
court
decided
to
do
it
in
an
irrational
way
saying
even
if
all
the
evidence
leads
to
a
yes
answer,
you
can
say
no
any
way,
and
that's
to
me
the
nub
of
the
problem
here
because
if
as
we
have
repeatedly
said
the
jury
is
supposed
to
engage
in
some
kind
of
a
reasoned
moral
process,
this
was
not
a
reasoned
moral
process;
it
was
an
irrational
process.
what's
your
response
to
that?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
it
has...
this
is
the
point
of
my
question,
it
has
repeatedly
told
everybody
that
the
process
of
arriving
at
a
determination
or
a
choice
between
life
and
death
is
supposed
to
be
a
reasoned
moral
process
and
it
seems
to
me
by
definition
inconsistent
with
that
standard
to
say
that
it
suffices
to
tell
the
jury
that
you
may
behave
in
a
totally
irrational
way.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
concede,
do
you,
that
giving
a
negative
response
to
any...
to
all
of
the
three
questions
on
the
basis
of
the
mental
incapacity
of
the
defendant
would
have
been
irrational?
that
is
to
say
even
though
a
deliberateless...
deliberateness
instruction
was
not
given,
you
don't
concede
that
it
would
have
been
irrational
for
the
jury
to
find
that
since
this
defendant
did
not
have
adequate
mental
capacity,
he
did
not
act
with
the
requisite
deliberateness?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
that's
irrational?
unknown
speaker
what
we
said
in
penry
one
was
that
that
is
not
necessarily
clear
to
the
jury,
but
we
didn't
say
that
it
was
irrational.
unknown
speaker
we
did
say
in
penry
one
that
it
was
an
inadequate
alternative,
didn't
we?
that's
why
the
case
went
back.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words
in
the
absence
of
a
deliberateness
instruction
different
from
the
one
given
in
penry
one,
the
penry
instructions
were
not
adequate.
that's
what
penry
held,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
it
held
that?
unknown
speaker
then
the
irrationality
apparently
started
with
this
court.
unknown
speaker
why
did
we
reverse
the
case?
unknown
speaker
i
think
counsel
said
this
was
one
of
various
ones
he
had
been...
you're
not
holding
him
simply
to
this
instruction.
unknown
speaker
his
point
is
this
just
shows
how
hard
it
is
to
do.
unknown
speaker
mr.
taylor,
can
i
just
ask
you
one
question.
it
seems
to
me
that
one
things
that
cuts
across
all
the
instructions
are
the
special
issues
that
were
given
to
the
jury
at
the
very
end
and
with
respect
to
each
of
the
three
special
issues,
the
jury
was
said
in
order
to
say
no
to
that,
we
the
jury
because
at
least
ten
jurors
have
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
the
matter
inquired
into
in
this
special
issue
find
and
determine
that
the
answer...
issue
is
no.
now
how
could
any...
how
could
the
foreperson
sign
a
negative
answer
to
a
special
issue
unless
there
were
several
jurors
who
said
i
don't
think
the
facts
support
it?
unknown
speaker
that's
flatly
inconsistent
with
the
command
in
the
special
issue
that
because
at
least
ten
jurors
have
a
reasonable
doubt
we
must
answer
no.
unknown
speaker
mr.
taylor,
you
said
before
that
the
instruction,
the
so
called
fourth
instruction,
accompanied
the
jury
into
the
jury
room
together
with
the
three
special
issues.
physically
what
did
the
jury
have?
they
had
on
a
piece
of
paper
the
three
questions
and
then
where
did
the
fourth
issue
show
up?
unknown
speaker
was
all
this
presented
so
that
each
jury
would
understand
from
what
the
juror
took
into
the
jury
room
that
these
were
to
work
together?
did
they
have
this
special
issues
on
one
page?
you
said
something
in
the
beginning
about--
unknown
speaker
--suppose
i
thought
just
going
back
to
your
instruction
which
as
you
read
it
properly
"if
you
determine
when
giving
effect
to
the
mitigating
evidence,
if
any,
that
a
life
sentence
as
reflected
by
a
negative
finding
to
the
issue
under
consideration
is
appropriate.
"
so
what
should
i
do
as
a
juror
if
i
thought
that
a
life
sentence
is
appropriate
because
of
the
abused
childhood
and
the
mental
retardation,
but
i
didn't
think
a
life
sentence
as
reflected
by
a
negative
answer
to
these
questions
was
appropriate,
what
am
i
supposed
to
do?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
didn't
ask
it
clearly.
suppose
i
believe
a
life
sentence
is
appropriate
but
i
don't
believe
a
life
sentence
as
reflected
by
a
negative
answer
to
a
finding
to
the
issue
under
consideration;
i
don't
believe
it
is
appropriate
as
reflected
by
deliberation;
i
don't
believe
it
is
appropriate
as
reflected
by
lack
of
dangerousness.
i
believe
it
is
appropriate
for
a
totally
different
reason
that
is
nowhere
reflected
in
the
issue
under
consideration
then
what
am
i
supposed
to
do?
it
seems
to
me
that
this
instruction
is
silent
as
to
that
matter.
unknown
speaker
suppose
i
accept
that
i
know
that
i
think
we
know
that
particular
statement--
--can
i
hear
the
rest
of
it,
can
i
hear
the
rest
of
it?
unknown
speaker
you
say
a
statement
similar
to
that
was
made
to
each
one
of
the
jurors
during
the
voir
dire?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
this
instruction,
you
mean
the
instruction
that
is
set
forth
as
well
on
page
5
of
the
blue
brief:
"if
you
find
there
any
mitigating
circumstances
in
this
case.
"
or
was
it
just
the
three
special
issues?
unknown
speaker
the
instruction
that's
set
forth
on
page
5
was
read
to
them
in
voir
dire?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
the
one
we're
focusing
on.
"if
you
find
there
any
mitigating
circumstances
in
this
case.
"
et
cetera.
unknown
speaker
now
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
found
that
the
supplemental
instruction
was
a
nullification
instruction.
are
we
bound
by
that
determination?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
matter
of
texas
law?
did
they
look
at
it
from
that
perspective
and
say
as
a
matter
of
texas
law
it
was
a
nullification?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
your
time
is
far
off
still.
unknown
speaker
mr.
taylor,
what
i
don't
understand
about
this
is
i
don't
understand
what
evidence
that
penry
submitted
that
statement
by
doctor
peebles
rebutted.
unknown
speaker
this
part
of
your
argument
it
seems
to
me
contradicts
your
first.
you're
saying
the
jury
can't
really
consider
mitigating
circumstances
because
we're
talking
about
dangerousness.
that's
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
you're
saying
in
the
first
part
of
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
taylor.
mr.
schaerr
we'll
hear
from
you--
unknown
speaker
you
would
agree
i
take
it
that
we
would...
we
were
not
required
in
order
to
establish
a
clear
standard
we
were
not
required
in
penry
one
to
say
the
instructions
have
got
to
call
for
a
rational
process,
the
instructions
have
got
to
call
for
a
process
that
reasonable
jurors
could
at
least
intellectually
follow,...
i
take
it
that
if
we
found
a
deficiency
on
such
points
as
that
that
you
would
not
feel
that
edpa
stood
in
the
way
of
granting
relief
here.
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
make
sure
we're
together
at
least
on
one
point.
when
we
say
that
instructions
are
inadequate
and
it
has
to
go
back
for
better
instructions,
i
take
it
it's
not
your
position
that
edpa
would
require
us
to
say
something
like
and
the
instructions
have
got
to
be
clear,
they've
got
to
be
rational,
they've
got
to
be
instructions
that
juries
can
follow.
i
take
it
you
would
agree
that
at
least
those
requirements
are
implicit
and
clearly
implicit
in
what
we
hold
when
we
say
the
first
instructions
are
inadequate.
do
you
agree?
unknown
speaker
if
the
answer
is
no,
i
wonder
what
happens
to...
it
seems
to
me
your
position
has
considerable
implication
for
the
authority
of
this
court
in
criminal
cases.
we
issue
mandates
and
you're
saying
that
those
mandates
could
be
ignored
by
a
state
as
long
as
the
way
in
which
the
state
ignores
the
mandate
commends
itself
to
some
reasonable
juror...
reasonable
lawyer
rather
though
most
reasonable
lawyers
decide
the
contrary,
is
that
what
you're
thinking?
unknown
speaker
what
about
that
though?
i
mean
i'm
not
asking
it
argumentively.
i'm
trying
to
follow
through
on
the
implication.
we
have
a
mandate,
we
issue
it
to
a
state,
now
in
your
view
they...
they
do
what
two
or
three
lawyers
might
think
was
reasonable
but
97
wouldn't
and
so
what
are
we
supposed
to
do?
unknown
speaker
all
right
then
however...
you
see
what
i'm
getting
at.
i'm
worried
about
the
implications
there
for
the
compliance
by
a
state
with
a
mandate
of
the
supreme
court
and
that's
what
i'd
like
you
to
think
through
for
me.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
we
know
either.
we
haven't
stated
a
number
seven,
18,
32
we
don't
know
either.
mr.
schaerr
we
did
say
in
a
case
that
came
down
rather
recently
in
the
sapple
case
that
south
carolina
just
didn't
get
it,
it
didn't
pay
attention
to
our
decision
in
simmons.
this
case
has
something
of
the
same
feel
to
it.
unknown
speaker
didn't
those
judges
look
at
the
instruction
in
isolation
without
reading
it
against
the
special
issues?
unknown
speaker
did
they
refer
to
the
special
issues
in
their
comment
on
the
instructions?
unknown
speaker
the
language
about
what
they
have
to
do
to
answer
no,
that
at
least
ten
jurors
have
to
have
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
the
facts?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
fairly
relevant?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
about
that?
the
other
thing
more
philosophically,
as
a
prosecutor,
someone
on
that
side,
if
this
court
were
to
say
nullification
instructions
are
okay,
might
that
come
back
to
haunt
you
some
day
in
other
cases,
indeed
to
bite
you
if
you
see
what
i'm
driving
at?
i
want
to
get
your
reaction
to
that
as
a
prosecutor.
unknown
speaker
the
word
nullification
instruction
is
almost
an
oxymoron,
isn't
it,
because
you
think
of
nullification
jury
as
refusing
to
follow
an
instruction
rather
than
following
one.
unknown
speaker
thank
you
mr.
schaerr.
mr.
smith
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
smith
the
case
is
submitted.
unknown
speaker
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
00-6677,
penry
against
johnson
would
be
announced
justice
o'connor.
