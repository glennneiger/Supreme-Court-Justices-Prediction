mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
despite
the
lip
service
that
the
petitioner
pays
to
edpa,
the
fundamental
flaw
in
both
of
his
claims
is
that
they
ignore
the
statute's
threshold
requirement
and
that
is
that
the
principal
of
federal
law
on
which
he
relies
be
clearly
established
in
this
court's
decisions
and
not
just
arguably
established.
let's
take
first
his
challenge
to
the
jury
instruction,
the
first
question
to
ask
of
course
is
what
principle
did
this
court's
penry
jurisprudence
clearly
establish
as
opposed
to
arguably
establish
when
the
state
courts
made
their
decisions
below.
i
submit
that
what
penry
clearly
established
is
summarized
at
page
328
of
the
penry
opinion
in
which
the
court
said
that
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
instructions
informing
the
jury
that
it
can
consider
and
give
effect
to
the
mitigating
evidence
by
declining
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
this
is
how
the
penry
one
holding
was
characterized
in
subsequent
opinions
of
this
court
including
graham
and
sapple
and
others,
and
it's
true
that
penry
one
discussed
some
of
the
ways
that
texas
might
comply
with
this
principle
but
it
did
not
clearly
establish
that
these
additional
instructions
either
had
to
include
a
separate
special
issue
or
had
to
expressly
tell
the
jury
that
it
could
answer
no
to
a
special
issue
even
if
the
literal
answer
was
yes
or
that
it
had
to
expressly
define
deliberately.
the
court
i
submit
did
not
attempt
to
micro
manage
texas
procedure
in
any
of
those
ways
and
in
fact
as
later
opinions
pointed
out
it
could
not
have
done
so
without
creating
a
new
rule
under
teague.
indeed
the
term
after
penry
one
both
boyd
and
sapple
made
crystal
clear
that
penry
one
had
left
intact
the
state's
freedom
to
structure
and
shape
the
jury's
consideration
of
mitigating
evidence.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
well
the
application
of
penry
one
would
have
to
not
only
be
incorrect
or
less
than
perfect,
it
would
have
to
be
unreasonable
under
this
court's
analysis
in
williams
versus
taylor,
and
let
me
address
that
question
now
if
i
might.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
i
think
that's
right
and
i
think
these
instructions
complied
with
those
requirements
at
least
to
the
extent
that
a
reasonable
jurist
could
conclude
that
they
did
comply.
it
seems
to
me
the
only
real
question
under
edpa
with
regard
to
the
jury
instruction
is
whether
that
instruction
was
a
reasonable
application
of
this
court's
penry
jurisprudence.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
not
at
all,
justice
breyer.
obviously
the
state
has
to
comply
with
the
court's
mandate.
the
question
is
did
they
do
so
in
a
reasonable
way,
and
i
think--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--certainly
the
court
held
in
williams
versus
taylor
that
it's
not
enough
to
have
one
jurist
that
might
conclude
that
it
was
reasonable.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
sure
and
i
agree.
they
have
to
do
it
in
a
reasonable
way
but
i
can't...
i
don't
think
it's
possible
to
draw
a
line
and
say
if
70
percent
of--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--well
i...
with
all
respect
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
think
that's
true.
in
fact
in
this
case
to
me
the
key
distinguishing
factor
between
this
case
and
penry
one
is
that
here
unlike
penry
one,
the
trial
court
actually
gave
a
very
extended
instruction
on
the
subject
of
mitigating
evidence
as
mr.
taylor
has
discussed
earlier.
that
was
instruction
number
four
and
there
was
no
corresponding
instruction
given
in
penry
one
and
so
the
only
question...
so
clearly
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
that
and
clearly
the
lower
courts
at
least
attempted
to
apply
this
court's
precedent
in
penry
one.
whether
they
did
so
reasonably
is
the
real
question
of
the
day
and
i
think
on
that
point
it's
significant
although
not
dispositive
that
of
the
ten
state
judges
and
the
four
federal
judges
who
address
this
issue
on
the
merits,
not
one
of
them
concluded
that
the
instruction
was
an
unreasonable
application
of
penry
one.
there
was
one
judge
in
the
fifth
circuit
who
concluded
that
it
was
incorrect
but
again
under
williams
versus
taylor
it's
not
enough
that
the
application
be
incorrect
and
especially
not
less
than
perfect.
and
so
even
if
it
would
have
been
better
to
add
a
fourth
special
issue,
that
doesn't
make
the
texas
decision
unreasonable
especially
in
light
of
boyd
and
sapple
which
say
that
the
states
retain
their
right
to
structure
and
shape
the
jury's
consideration
of
mitigating
evidence.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
well
i
think
they...
i
don't
think
they
looked
at
it
in
isolation.
i
think--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--i
believe
they
did
and
certainly
that
was
the
entire
issue
throughout
the--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--i
don't
recall
if
they
focused
on
that
specific
language.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
well
it
is
relevant
but
as
boyd
says
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
as
well
they
look
to
the
entire
context
of
the
trial.
it's
under
boyd
it
is
clearly
fair
game
to
look
at
voir
dire
and
closing
arguments
and
all
of
that,
and
so
even
if
it
might
have
been
better
under...
even
if
it
might
have
been
better
to
tell
the
jury
more
clearly
that
it
could
answer
a
special
interrogatory
no
when
it
thought
the
answer
was
yes,
that
also
doesn't
make
the
instruction
unreasonable
and
as
we've
discussed
especially
in
light
of
the
other
circumstances
of
the
trial.
i
also
think
that
there's
no
arguable
problem
in
this
case
under
roberts
because
the
problem
in
roberts
which
of
course
was
a
plurality
opinion
was
that
there
was
no
instruction
at
all
that
even
authorized
the
jury
to
find
a
lesser
included
offense
if
it
wanted
to
give
a
life
sentence
instead
of
a
death
sentence.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
i
think
the
way
the
word
nullification
was
used
by
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals,
it
was
simply
that
the
jury
could
in
essence
nullify
what
it
might
otherwise
consider
to
be
the
correct
answer
to
one
of
those
three
special
interrogatories.
i
don't
think
they
were
saying
that
nullification
instructions
as
a
general
matter
are
proper
or
anything
like
that
but
as
used
here
that's
what
nullification
means.
i
don't
think
there's
any
magic.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
right
and
that
was
the
situation
in
roberts,
but
that's
not
the
situation
here.
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
instruction
at
issue
here
was
reasonable
in
my
view,
if
for
no
other
reason
that
it
gave
the
jury
at
least
one
clear
path
to
a
life
sentence
based
on
the
petitioner's
mitigating
evidence
and
that
is
all
that
this
court's
decisions
clearly
required.
now
finally
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
as
the
court
considers
the
statute
here
that
edpa
was
designed
to
curb
what
congress
saw
as
an
enormous
and
undue
federal
burden
on
the
state's
criminal
justice
systems.
thank
you.
