justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
have
an
opinion
to
announce
in
two
consolidated
cases
596
597,
lorillard
tobacco
company
versus
reilly,
altadis
u.s.a.
versus
reilly.
the
cases
come
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
in
1999,
the
respondent,
the
attorney
general
of
massachusetts
issued
regulations
covering
the
advertising
and
sale
of
cigarettes,
smokeless
tobacco
and
cigars.
the
state
regulations
were
created
to
address
the
problem
of
tobacco
use
by
persons
under
the
age
of
18,
and
to
prevent
access
to
tobacco
products
by
under
aged
persons.
there
are
three
types
of
regulations
at
issue
in
these
cases:
first,
are
regulations
that
prohibit
outdoor
advertising
of
tobacco
products
within
1000
feet
of
a
school
or
playground;
second
are
regulations
that
require
indoor
advertising
to
be
placed
no
lower
than
five
feet
from
the
floor;
third
are
regulations
that
restrict
sales
practices
for
tobacco
products,
for
example
requiring
that
such
products
be
accessible
only
through
sales
personnel
not
directly
from
a
shelf
by
the
purchaser.
before
the
effective
date
of
these
regulations,
the
petitioners
a
group
of
cigarette,
smokeless
tobacco,
cigar
manufacturers
and
retailers
filed
suit
against
the
respondent
in
federal
district
court.
the
cigarette
petitioners
argued
that
the
regulations
for
outdoor
and
indoor
cigarette
advertising
were
preempted
by
the
federal
cigarette
labeling
and
advertising
act,
the
acronym
is
fclaa.
an
act
in
which
congress
prescribed
health
warnings
for
cigarette
labels
in
advertising
and
prohibited
certain
state
regulations.
the
smokeless
tobacco
and
cigar
petitioners
argued
that
the
indoor
and
outdoor
advertising
regulations
for
their
products
violated
the
first
amendment.
the
cigarette,
smokeless
tobacco
and
cigar
petitioners
also
claimed
that
the
sales
practice
regulations
violated
the
first
amendment.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
rejected
all
of
the
petitioners’
claims
and
upheld
all
the
regulations
before
the
court
today.
the
court
of
appeals
first
concluded
that
the
federal
act
did
not
preempt
the
cigarette
advertising
regulations
because
the
federal
law
only
preempted
state
regulations
of
the
content
of
cigarette
advertising
and
that
the
massachusetts
regulations
at
issue,
regulated
only
the
location
of
the
advertising.
the
court
of
appeals
also
concluded
that
the
outdoor
advertising,
indoor
advertising
and
sales
practices
regulations
were
valid
under
the
first
amendment.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
affirm
in
part,
reverse
in
part
that
judgment.
before
reaching
the
first
amendment
issues,
we
first
address
the
cigarette
petitioners’
claims
that
the
massachusetts
regulations
are
preempted
by
federal
law,
the
fclaa.
in
the
federal
act,
congress
prescribed
the
health
warnings
that
have
to
appear
on
the
cigarette
packages
in
a
advertising.
congress
banned
the
advertising
of
cigarettes
on
radio
and
television.
congress
charged
the
federal
trade
commission
with
monitoring
cigarette
advertising
and
promotion.
the
federal
act
also
contains
a
preemption
provision;
in
which
congress
expressly
prohibit
states
from
imposing
any
requirement
or
prohibition
based
on
smoking
and
health
with
respect
to
advertising
and
promotion
of
cigarettes.
after
examining
the
act
as
a
whole,
and
the
context
in
which
the
preemption
provision
was
enacted,
we
conclude
that
the
massachusetts
regulations
on
cigarette
advertising
are
preempted
by
federal
law.
first,
we
conclude
that
the
cigarette
advertising
regulations
are
based
on
smoking
and
health
because
the
concern
about
youth
smoking
and
youth
exposure
to
advertising
is
intertwined
with
the
more
general
concern
about
smoking
and
health.
second,
we
conclude
that
in
the
preemption
provision,
congress
did
not
intend
to
distinguish
between
state
regulation
of
the
content
of
cigarette
advertising
as
opposed
to
state
regulation
of
the
location
of
that
advertising.
the
massachusetts
regulations
are
clearly
regulations
with
respect
to
advertising
and
promotion
that
are
based
on
smoking
and
health,
and
therefore
are
preempted
by
federal
law.
we
next
address
the
smokeless
tobacco
and
cigar
petitioners’
claims
that
the
outdoor
advertising
and
indoor
advertising
regulations
violate
the
first
amendment.
we
conclude
that
these
regulations
do
not
survive
first
amendment
scrutiny,
primarily
because
the
massachusetts
restriction
on
speech
is
too
broad.
for
example,
the
outdoor
advertising
regulations
restricting
advertising
within
1000
feet
of
any
school
or
playground
will
nearly
ban
all
outdoor
advertising
of
tobacco
in
all
the
major
metropolitan
areas
of
massachusetts.
because
tobacco
used
by
adults
is
lawful
in
massachusetts,
tobacco
manufacturers
and
retailers
have
a
protected
first
amendment
interest
in
conveying
truthful
information
about
tobacco
products,
and
adult
consumers
have
a
first
amendment
interest
in
receiving
truthful
information
about
tobacco
products.
for
instance,
under
the
state
regulations,
it
would
be
invalid
for
a
store
such
as
a
convenience
market
to
even
have
a
sign
on
the
window
saying
“cigarettes
sold
here”.
the
massachusetts
had
an
obligation
to
calculate
the
costs
and
benefits
associated
with
the
burdens
on
speech
imposed
by
the
regulations.
we
conclude
that
the
calculation
in
this
case
was
insufficient
for
purposes
of
the
first
amendment.
finally,
we
address
the
first
amendment
challenge
to
the
sales
practices
regulations
which
restrict
access
to
tobacco
products
by
consumers
by
requiring
direct
contact
with
a
salesperson
before
handling
the
products.
we
conclude
that
that
regulation
is
really
a
“regulation
of
conduct”
that
has
only
an
incidental
effect
on
speech.
the
sales
practices
regulations
are
designed
to
prevent
direct
youth
access
to
tobacco
products.
they
are
not
designed
to
suppress
a
speech
or
expression.
moreover,
the
regulations
leave
open
and
pull
alternative
avenues
for
communication
for
retailers
to
convey
information
about
their
products.
we
hold
that
the
sales
practices
regulations
are
valid
under
the
first
amendment.
now,
you
need
a
roadmap
to
know
which
justices
joined
which
parts
of
this
complicated
opinion.
suffice
to
say
there
is
a
court
for
all
portions
of
it.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
which
justice
scalia
has
joined;
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
souter
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part;
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part,
in
which
justices
ginsburg
and
breyer
have
joined.
