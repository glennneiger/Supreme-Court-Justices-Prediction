mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
massachusetts
attorney
general's
advertising
ban
constitutes
a
prohibition,
based
on
smoking
and
health,
imposed
under
state
law
with
respect
to
cigarettes
and
other
tobacco
products.
for
those
straightforward
reasons,
it
is
preempted
by
federal
law
and,
for
these
and
other
reasons,
it
abridges
free
speech
in
violation
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
as
to
the
preemption
argument,
the
court
of
appeals
analysis
is
no
longer
being
defended.
it
cannot
be.
this
ban
is
emphatically
a
prohibition
with
respect
to
advertising.
nor
can
the
ban,
alternatively,
be
defended
on
the
ground
that
it
is
not
based
on
smoking
and
health.
of
course
it
is
based
on
smoking
and
health,
as
one
look
at
massachusetts'
first
amendment
argument
proves,
and
as
they
ultimately
concede.
massachusetts'
alternative
argument
is
that
the
ban
can
be
sustained
so
long
as
there
are
other
permissible
nonpreemptive
grounds
for
the
ban,
but
if--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
we
know,
your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
motivation,
it's
based
on,
the
phrase
is
based
on,
so
it
has
a
subjective
component
to
it
and,
as
the
attorney
general
acknowledged
when
he
announced
the
regulations...
look
at
j.a.
page
251.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
the
reason--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
the
very
fact,
your
honor,
that
the
word
based
on,
if
you
look
at
5(b),
they
use
the
word
based
on,
and
i
think
what
they're
trying
to
do
is
read
that
out
of
the
statute.
that
has
a
motviational
component
to
it,
and
so
it
is
fully
appropriate--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
if
you
look
at
the--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
the
fact
is,
under
the
ban
you're
not
allowed
to
have
advertisements
specifically
with
the
warning
label
that
is
required
under
federal
law,
so
in
that
way,
operationally,
it's
precluded.
but
i
just
want
to
make
sure
that
our
position
is
clear.
it
has
both
an
effects
and
an
intent
component
to
it,
the
based-on-smoking-and-health
language,
and
that's
why
it's
banned
under
either
theory.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
absolutely,
your
honor,
and
here's
the
reason.
in
1969,
when
they
were
looking
at
whether
to
amend
section
5(d)
and
how
to
amend
it,
one
of
the
great
concerns
was
that
states
or
localities
ultimately
would
respond
to
the
ftc's
warning
requirement
on
advertising
by
ultimately
expressing
disagreement
with
that
warning
requirement.
the
concern
was
after
'69
they'd
say,
that's
not
enough,
we
don't
like
it,
and
so
what
they'd
do
in
response
is,
they'd
say,
we're
just
going
to
ban
advertising
altogether,
and
that's
exactly
what
california
was
considering
in
'69,
new
york
city
was
considering
in
'69.
it
was
before
the
congress
in
1969,
and
that's
why
they
banned
this
very
type
of
thing.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
everything,
your
honor...
you're
saying
specifically
regulations
themselves,
and
you're
saying
we're
not
going
to
look
at
why
massachusetts
did
that,
and
so
just
for
a
second
we'll
suspend
that
and
assume
you
don't
look
at
intent.
but
even
if
you
look
at
intent,
at
what
they
did
in
effect,
it's
not
just
that
you
can't
get
the
warnings.
obviously,
it
just
relates
to
schools.
i
mean,
that
is
a
health-related
reason.
they
were
concerned
about
underage
sales
to
children.
that's
a
health--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--absolutely,
your
honor,
and
i
mean,
that
alone
on
the
face
of
the
statute
proves
the
very
fact.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
your
honor,
that's
an
important
point.
in
1969,
the
reason
you
had
to
have
based-on-smoking-and-health
language
there
is,
otherwise
this
ban
would
apply
to
all
general
zoning
laws.
in
other
words,
you'd
have
erisa
ii
without
the
based-on-smoking-and-health
language.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
the
very
point--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--no,
but
that's
my
point.
my
point
is
that,
without
the
based-on-smoking-and-health
language
you'd
have
erisa
in
the
sense
that
every
state
law
that
had
any
application
to
cigarette
advertising
would
be
covered.
that
would
mean
the
states
or
localities
couldn't
have
general
zoning
laws
regarding
advertising,
billboards,
or
store
front
signs.
the
based-on-smoking-and-health
language
critically--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--maybe
i'm
not
understanding
your
question,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--exactly.
exactly,
and
i'm
making
the
point
that,
without
the
based-on-smoking-and-health
language
you'd
have
a
situation
where
section
5(b)
conceivably,
a
little
bit
like
erisa,
could
cover
every
single
general
zoning
law
regarding
all
commercial,
all
noncommercial--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--not
at
all,
your
honor.
if
you
take--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
the
based-on-smoking-and-health
language,
i
think,
does
it
very
directly.
i
mean,
keep
in
mind,
they
were
amending
section
5(b)
in
1969.
prior
to
1969
they
had
the
language
that
said,
statements
in
advertising.
in
'69
they
go
to
requirements
or
prohibitions
with
respect
to
advertising.
that
would
cover
an
awful
lot
of
general
laws
but
for
the
based-on-smoking-and-health
language,
and
that's
exactly--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--no,
your
honor,
and
that's
a
critical,
and
again
if
you
go
back
to
section
5(b),
you'll
see
why.
conspicuously
missing
from
5(b)
is
the
word
sale.
it
just
preempts
bans
on
advertising
or
promotion,
but
not
sale,
so
for
example...
and
this
is
in
cippolone
at
footnote
26--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
i
think
there
would
be
some
situaitons
where
state
laws
along
those
lines
would
not
be
preempted,
but
they're
very
few.
let
me
give
you
one
example.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
but
that's
not
a
law
at
this
court
that
we're
arguing
is
preempted
here,
and
it's
not
one
we
sought
preemption
on.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
i
understand
what
you're
saying.
i
think
there
is
a
line
here
that
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
draw,
and
i
think
it
goes
something
like
this.
we
know
the
states
after
'69
could
still
have
bans
on
sales
to
minors.
that
also
must
mean
you
couldn't
have
offers
to
sell,
conspiracies
to
sell,
or
a
direct
solicitation
for--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--but
your
honor,
once
you're
beyond
a
direct
solicitation
for
a
legal
sale,
you're
into
the
main
core
language
of
section
5(b),
and
keep
in
mind,
congress
was
not
unaware
of
the
problems
you're
raising,
and
that's
why
they
made
sure
that
the
ftc
had
authority
in
this
industry
to
investigate
unfair
and
deceptive
trade
practices.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
i
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor,
and
this
was
the
quid
pro
quo
in
1969.
on
the
one
hand,
in
the
same
act
they
said
there
shall
be
no
cigarette
advertisiing
on
radio
and
tv.
on
the
other
hand,
the
other
side
of
the
bargain
is,
we're
not
going
to
let
localities
and
states
after
the
fact
start
to
ban
it
as
well,
just
as
they
were
considering
doing.
but
i
think...
there
are
two
things
that
get
to
the
children's
solicitation.
if
it
is
not
a
direct
solicitation
for
an
illegal
sale,
then
it
is
preempted,
but
there
are
two
reasons
the
court
may
not
be
concerned
about
that.
first,
the
ftc
does
have
authority
to
investigate
this
very
thing.
in
fact,
the
state
of
massachusetts
in
1993
asked
the
ftc
to
investigate
a
tobacco
company
on
just
these
grounds.
the
ftc
did,
and
so
it
shows
they
understood
it,
and
the
ftc
knew
how
to
operate.
secondly--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--in
1996,
right.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
your
honor,
on
this...
the
theory
that's
being
advanced
to
this
court
has
been
embraced
by
only
one
circuit,
the
fourth,
and--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
all
told,
four,
but
the
three
others
that
have
done
it
have
done
it
with
respect
to
advertising,
which
is
a
theory
that
is
no
longer
being
defended.
the
only
court
that
has
embraced
the
based-on-smoking-and-health
theory
was
the
fourth,
and
the
second
circuit
dismissed
that
as
mere
sophistry,
as
i
think
they
should
have.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
exactly.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
and
i'm
just
making
the
point
that
three
of
those
circuits
embraced
a
reasoning
that
is
no
longer
being
defended,
which
leaves
the
based-on-smoking-and-health
theory
advocated
here,
and
i
don't
know
how
you
can
look
honestly
at
their
brief,
the
press
release
of
the
attorney
general
when
he
announced
these
regulations,
and
say
they
weren't
based
on
smoking
and
health.
that
animated
everything
they
did.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
that
is
fully
up
to
the
court.
i
mean,
we've
been
willing
to
argue
the
alternative
ground
that
massachusetts
presented,
but
if
the
court
wishes
to
send
it
back,
that's
fine.
we're
agnostic
about
that
point.
but
we
do
think
either
theory
does
not
work.
and
the
other
point
i
wanted
to
make
that
i
think
gets
to
your
point,
justice
ginsburg,
and
yours,
justice
o'connor,
is,
keep
in
mind
these
children's
solicitation
hypotheticals
are
really
hypotheticals.
i
mean,
all
of
the
major
tobacco
manufacturers
entered
into
an
msa,
multisettlement
agreement,
multi-state
settlement
agreement,
in
november
of
1998,
that
prohibits
this
very
thing.
i
mean,
this
is
something
that
cannot
happen
after
1998
by
98
percent
of
the
cigarette
manufacturers
in
this
country.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
this
provides
a
transition
to
the
first
amendment
argument.
i
mean,
ultimately,
you
are
allowed
to
aggregate
all
state
conduct,
so
the
90-percent
figure
is
a
legitimate
figure,
because
it
is
aggregating
all
state
conduct.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
that
is
not--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
either
way,
your
honor,
i
would
submit
it
is
an
advertising
ban.
it
is
a
regulation
with
respect
to
advertising
cigarettes
and,
as
justice
blackmun
said
in
cippolone,
you
cannot,
after
1969,
do
by
negative
mandate
what
you
can't
do
by
positive
mandate.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
to
the
extent
of
the--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--it's
not
in
the
record.
it's
simply
not
in
the
record
as
to
what
the
additional
percentage
of
restriction
is
by
the
advertising
ban.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
conceivably,
your
honor,
yes.
if
i
could
turn
to
the
first
amendment
argumemt--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--but
i
was
actually
referring
to
1335,
which
is
the
ban
on
radio
and
tv
advertising.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
and
then
section
5
of
1334(b)
is
what
has
the
preemption.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
the
legislative
history
is
pretty
extensive
in
1969.
it's
clear,
we
know
one
reason
for
the
radio
and
tv
ban
was
protecting
children
health,
and
i
think
that's
one
reason
why
the
5(b)
preemption,
after
section
5(b),
would
still
apply
to
types
of
hypotheticals
we've
been
talking
about.
but
your
question,
you
know,
as
to
whether...
what
were
the
cigarette
companies
getting
out
of
the
quid
pro
quo--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--obviously--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--i
have
no
idea,
but
it's
clear
there
was
one
thing
animating
the
discussion.
we're
not
going
to
say
there's
a
complete
ban
on
radio
and
tv,
and
then
after
the
fact
every
city
and
state
in
this
country
can
then
supppress
the
rest
of
the
speech.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
trying,
yes.
[laughter]
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
not
necessarily
at
all,
your
honor,
and
again
this
is
hypothetical.
the
industry
agreed
they
they
were
going
to
withdraw
from
that
particular
form
of
advertising
before
the
ban
went
into
effect.
they've
not
challenged
it
since
and,
in
fact,
this
court
has
already
upheld
the
ban.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
on
the
view
that
different
medium...
a
different
medium
is
treated
differently,
and
that's
what
the
court
did
in
red
lion.
the
court
has
followed
red
lion
since
and,
in
fact,
in
virginia
board
of
pharmacy,
the
key
case
in
1976
that
started
to
recognize
the
constitutional
protection
for
commercial
speech,
that's
exactly
what
the
court
did.
we
said,
we're
going
to...
we've
got
here
a
price
advertising
ban.
we're
not
going
to
deal
with
the
question
of
how
that
ban
would
be
treated
if
it
were
on
a
different
medium
of
communication.
i
think
the
court
should
do
the
same
thing
here.
the
key
problem
with
this
particular
law
and
why
it
gets
strict
scrutiny
is
the
fact
that
it
does
suppress
a
substantial
amount
of
speech
directed
to
adults
about
a
lawful
product,
and
does
so
solely
based
on
the
message
in
the
speech.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
it
is
very
much
like
playboy
entertainment,
and
we
would
submit,
your
honor...
and
rv,
but
if
indecent
speech,
if
racist
fighting
words
get
strict
scrutiny,
then
surely
commercial
speech
should
as
well.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
you're
exactly
right,
justice
kennedy.
we
do
not
need
to
have
a
strict
scrutiny
argument
in
order
to
win.
we
think
the
court
should
embrace
ultimately
the
plurality
reasoning
in
44
liquor
mart,
and
we
think
this
is
a
good
case
and
a
good
vehicle
to
do
it,
but
you're
right,
we
do
not
need
to
do
that.
this
law
does
have
a
more
fatal
flaw,
particularly
under
prong
4
of
central
hudson.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
but
your
honor,
even
if
you
take
that
view,
our
theory
allows
legislatures
to
take
into
account
the
commercial
aspects
of
speech
that
they're
allowed
to
regulate.
one
aspect
of
that
speech
they
can
regulate
is
deceptive
advertising,
or
advertising
that
solicits
an
illegal
sale.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
your
honor,
just
2
years
ago
in
greater
new
orleans
the
court
said
there
is
not
a
vice
exception
to
the
first
amendment,
and
now
it's
being
suggested
there's
a
vice
exception
to
the
no-vice
exception
rule.
i
mean,
this
is
a
product
that
is
lawful
in
this
country.
whenever
you've
got
a
product
that's
lawful
for
adults
but
not
for
children,
you
always
have
the
problem,
invariably,
that
speech
directed
to
adults
ultimately
will
get
to
children.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
and
your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--but
if
that
was,
let's
say,
a
commercial
aspect
concern
the
legislature
was
entitled
to
regulate,
they'd
have
to
follow
up
with
regulations
that
were
focused
on
that
concern.
these
regulations
do
no
such
thing.
they
make
tobacco--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--your
honor,
my
only
point
is,
if
you
take
that
view,
and
let's
say,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
you
do,
that
still
means
you
have
to
tailor,
whether
under
strict
or
intermediate
scrutiny,
your
regulation
to
that
concern.
you
cannot
say
that
about
this
law.
it
draws--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
your
honor,
we
would
say
that
geographically
it
is
still
too
broad,
but
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
with
justice
ginsburg,
and
i
hope
addresses
your
concern,
is
that
the
regulation
doesn't
focus
on
words,
advertisements
that
are
uniquely
appealing
to
children.
it
bars
the
mere
mention
of
the
word,
tobacco,
cigarettes,
cigar,
anywhere.
there's
no--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--brand
loyalty,
in
the
case
of
most
of
the
petitioners.
brand
loyalty.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
absolutely,
your
honor.
but
the...
i
think
this
issue--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--but
your
honor,
that's
exactly
my
point.
that's
not
what
all
cigarette
advertising
does,
and
that's
not
what
a
mom
and
pop
tobacco
store
would
do.
they
just
want
to
communicate
to
their
consumers
what
the
price
is,
what
the
brand
is,
whether
there's
a
sale,
what
the
contents
of
the--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--but
your
honor,
i
respectfully
think
you're
proving
my
point
there
are
different
types
of
advertising
out
there,
and
they've
banned
everything,
even
something
as
basic
as
price--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--not
across
the
board,
your
honor,
no,
they
cannot,
and
the
key
point--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--absolutely,
under
the
first
amendment
you
are,
absolutely
correct.
i'm
making
the
point
that--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--you
clearly
could
not,
and
carey
points
the
path
here.
you
cannot
incite
illegal
conduct.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
1,000
feet,
which
ultimately
is
90
percent
of
the
three
major
metropolitan
areas
in
massachusetts.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--anyone
concerned
about...
just...
anyone
concerned
about
the
radio
and
tv
badge...
ban
should
not
be
trying
to
sustain
these
laws.
i
mean,
we're
going
to
have
more
suppression
that's
only
going
to
make
the
radio
and
tv
ban
more
suspect,
so
i
want
to
make
sure
we're
clear
about
that
point.
the
second
problem
i
would
say,
here,
is
a
tailoring
problem,
and
it's
the
notion
that
the
issues
they
purported
to
be
addressing
in
january
of
1999
were
issues
they
claimed
to
the
state
of
massachusetts
they
had
resolved
in
november
of
1999...
excuse
me,
1998.
that
is
exactly
what
the
msa
did.
what
the
msa
did
is,
it
dealt
with
all
of
the
major
cigarette
manufacturers.
it
made
sure
that
there
would
not
be
any
youth
targeting
when
it
comes
to
advertisement.
it
banned
all
billboards.
this
is
not
a
billboard
case.
in
fact,
it's
barely
a
storefront
sign
case,
because
it
only
applies
to
storefront
signs
that
are
less
than
14
square
foot
in
size.
so
the
very
issues,
in
may
of
1998...
this
is
the
only
time
they
held
a
hearing...
they
thought
they
should
address
were
addressed
in
november
of
1998.
they
do
not--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--absolutely
not.
absolutely
not.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
he's
breaking
the
law
of
the
first
amendment.
you've
got
to
show
there
is
a
reason
to
suppress
speech
before
you
do
so.
you've
got
to
show
you've
tried
all
conduct
channels,
and
you've
got
to
show
that
the
alleged
commercial
aspects
of
the
speech
that
you
consider
problematic
are
still
problematic.
he
could
not
say
that
after
november
of
1998.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
that's
not
what
the
research
shows.
they
relied
on
the
fda
rule.
the
fda
rule
was
based
on
billboards.
that's
where
they
got
the
1,000-foot
measurement,
that
you
could
see
large
billboards
from
two
to
three
blocks
away,
and
despite
all
that,
and
despite
the
fact
that
after
november
'98--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--absolutely,
and
that's
exactly
what
the
first
amendment
requires.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
absolutely.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
absolutely,
and
in
fact
that's
what
sable
communications
says
at
pages
129
and
130,
that
in
that
case
it
was
the
fcc
that
had
a
rule,
and
they'd
not
waited
to
see
how
the
rule
worked,
in
other
words,
how
effective
it
was.
they
simply
passed
another
speech
suppression
measure,
and
this
is
exactly
what
the
court
said.
you've
got
to
see
if
that
conduct-related
measure
works
first
and
then,
if
it
doesn't,
and
only
if
it
doesn't,
can
you
narrowly
tailor
an
additional
law
that
perhaps
suppresses
some
speech,
but
only
what
is
necessary.
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
98
percent
of
the
tobacco
manufacturers
and,
indeed,
at
the
cert
stage
massachusetts
noted
in
its
opposition
brief
at
pages
9
and
10
that
the
court
shouldn't
take
this
case,
because
it
only
affects
these
petitioners.
i
think
that's
right.
the
issue--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--they
are
part
of
the
agreement.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
and
that
would
be
2
percent
of
the
industry,
and
there's
no
showing
in
this
record,
and
there
cannot
be,
that
there
are
trying
to
put
up
billboards,
or
that
they're
trying
to
put
up
alluring
storefront
signs
that
cause
problems
with--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--the
smokeless
tobacco
and
the
cigars
do
not
have
a
multi-state
agreement
with
massachusetts,
but
they
were
clearly
add-ons
when
it
comes
to
these
regulations.
there's
no
evidence
with
respect
to
them.
cigars,
i
think,
in
1997
spent
$50,000
total
just
on
storefront
signs
and,
as
to
smokeless
tobacco
in
massachusetts,
it
was
going
down
the
very
time
they
were
thinking
about
this
particular
issue,
so
they
were
clearly
add-ons.
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
a
few
brief
points.
the
solicitor
general
has
just
acknowleged
that
the
tombstone,
even
though
that's
content-based,
would
not
be
preempted.
they
now
no
longer
have
a
content-location
dichotomy.
they've
just
rewritten
5(b)
to
say,
with
respect
to
statements
in
advertising.
that's
the
only
way
to
give
content
to
1969
under
their
theory,
and
their
theory
ultimately
does
not
give
content
to
those
significant
amendments.
the
little
league
hypothetical
is
just
not
true.
that
would
be
a
direct
solicitation,
an
illegal
sale.
it
would
not
be
preempted,
would
not
be
barred
by
the
first
amendment.
they've
ackowledged
that
a
total
ban
would
not
be
preempted.
i
mean,
they've
just
said
that
you
could
have
a
total
ban
here.
that's
exactly
what
they
were
getting
at
in
1969.
now,
clearly
they
were
banning
not
just
brand-favorable
messages,
but
all
messages
that
are
favorable
to
tobacco.
that's
exactly
what
44
liquormart
is
about.
this
is
not
seven
dirty
words.
tobacco
is
not
a
four-letter
word.
it
is
not
just
about
one
word...
thank
you,
your
honor.
