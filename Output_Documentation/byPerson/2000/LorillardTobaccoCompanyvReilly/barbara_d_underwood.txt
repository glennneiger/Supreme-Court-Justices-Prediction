ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
state
regulation
is
not
preempted,
because
it
is
not
based
on
smoking
and
health
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
cigarette
labeling
and
advertising
law.
the
regulation
is
based
on
smoking
and
health
for
purposes
of
that
statute
only
if
it
requires
or
prohibits
claims
about
smoking
and
health,
and
not
just
because
it
was
motivated
by
some
underlying
concern
about
smoking
and
health
based
on--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
a
rule
that
says
that
you
can't
advertise
at
all
is
a
blanket
rule
like
a
rule
that
prohibits
deception,
which
might
also
prohibit
some
claims
about
smoking
and
health
and
isn't
aimed
at
claims
on
smoking
and
health,
so
i
would
say
it's
not
prohibited
under
that
understanding
of
the
preemption
statute,
but
one
could
distinguish
that
from
this
case.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
based
on
can
have
different
meanings
in
different
contexts,
but
when
one
statute
describes
another
statute
as
a
rule
based
on
something,
as
a
regulation
based
on
something,
that
language
ordinarily
refers
to
the
operating
criteria
of
the
regulation,
and
not
the
reason
why
it
was
adopted.
for
example,
when
congress
in
one
statute
refers
to
another
statute...
to
taxes
based
on
revenues,
or
it
refers
to
requirements
imposed
on
vehicles
based
on
size
or
weight,
it
is
using
a
shorthand
description
of
a
category
of
statute,
and
it
is
describing
the
text
of
the...
of
that
other
statute,
the
criteria
that
that
statute
uses,
and
not
the
reasons
it
came
into
existence.
it
is,
of
course--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--yes.
of
course,
the
1965
version
expressly
preempted
laws
that
required
statements
relating
to
smoking
and
health.
the
'69
amendment
was
designed,
said
the
senate
report,
as
a
clarification
and
not
a
radical
reform.
that
doesn't
mean
nothiong
was
changed,
but
it
does
mean
that
it
was
designed
to
reach
various
devices
that
were
the
functional
equivalent
of
required
statements,
and
weren't
picked
up
by
the
old
language.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
that's
one--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--that's
one
example.
by
dropping
the
term,
statements,
what
congress
reached
was,
with
apologies
to
justice
scalia,
common
law
duties
which
the
cippolone
plurality
noted
might
be
requirements,
but
weren't
required
statements,
because
required
statements,
in
the
'65
act,
was
thought
to
refer
to
specific
texts
that
were
required
and
it
may
also,
as,
justice
souter,
you
suggested,
have
reached
attempts
to
regulate
claims
that
were
made
not
by
statement
but
by
implication,
such
as
by
images,
or
other
implication.
and
then
by
adding
prohibitions
congress
reached
state
laws
that
would
have
the
effect
of
requiring
new
warnings,
but
would
do
so
in
the
form
of
a
prohibition,
say,
for
example,
no
advertising
without
this
warning,
which
in
effect
requires
a
warning,
but
does
it
in
the
form
of
a
prohibition,
and
it
would
also
reach
state
laws
prohibiting
affirmative
health
claims
about
filters,
say,
or
the
safety
of
a
particular
cigarette.
there
was
for
a
period
an
incipient
advertising
war
about
the
safer
cigarette,
and
there
was
some
concern
about
whether
the
states
would
choose
to
bar
that,
and
the
ftc
at
various
times
had
thought
it
was
desirable
to
promote
that
sort
of
competition
or
not,
depending
on--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--no
requirement
or
prohibition
that
regulates
claims
about
smoking
and
health,
assertions,
representations.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
things
that
are
like
statements--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--i
think
that
regulation
based
on
means
regulation
that
operates
on
the
basis
of,
that
tells
you
what
the
operating
criteria
of
the
regulation
are.
if
a
regulation
is
based
on
weight,
then
you
look
to
weight
to
find
out
if
it
applies
or
not,
and
if
a
regulation
is
based
on...
if
a
tax
is
based
on
revenue,
then
you
look
at
revenue
to
find
out
whether
or
how
it
applies.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
on
smoking
and
health.
they
prohibit
making
statements...
they
prohibit
saying
anything
about
smoking
and
health,
and
i
don't
think
an
inference
can
be
drawn
from
the
fact
that
the
ban
on
television
and
radio
occurred
at
the
same
time,
because
television
and
radio
have
traditionally
been
federal
concerns.
billboards
and
signs
have
traditionally
been
local
concerns.
there's
no
reason
to
infer
any
connection
between
them.
they've
always
been
regulated--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
another
thing
that
happened
is
that
promotions
were
added.
the
regulation
is
not
now
only
with
respect
to
advertising,
but
also
with
respect
to
promotions,
because
give-away
hats
and
t-shirts
and
keychains
can
also
make
claims
about
smoking
and
health,
and
because
promotions
in
the
form
of
endorsements
or
events
could
be
subject
to
a
state
requirement
that
health
disclaimers,
that
health
warnings
be
given,
and
what
congress
wanted
to
do
was
take
the
states
out
of
the
business
of
making
judgments
about
and
regulating
on
the
basis
of
claims
about
smoking
and
health.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
yes.
i
think
the
state's
interest
in
preventing
school-age
children
from
smoking
is
truly
compelling,
in
light
of
all
the
evidence
that
has
been
recited,
and
that
this
regulation
under
central
hudson
serves
that
goal
in
a
significant
way,
because
the
state
had
evidence
showing
that
the
ban
to
sales
to
children
was
not
effective,
that
it
was
reducing
retail
sales
to
children,
but
not
underage
smoking,
because
presumably
that
suggests
that
the
children
were
getting
their
cigarettes
from
people--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--if
there
was
a
prohibition
as
to
all
advertising,
i
think
that
would
be
more
expensive...
extensive
than
necessary.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no,
because
this
is
just
outdoor...
i'm
sorry.
a
prohibition
on
all
advertising
is
different
from
a
prohibition
on
outdoor
advertising.
there
are
still
ample
avenues,
even
if
there
were
a
prohibition
on
all
advertising,
which
this
is
not--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--there
would
still
be...
yes.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
actually,
this
statute
does
permit
tobacco
for
sale.
the
district
court
struck
that
tombstone
requirement,
that
tombstone
permission
on
what
we
believe
to
be
the
mistaken
ground
that
it,
itself,
was
preempted,
but
the
first
circuit
observed...
expressed
some
reservations
about
that,
and
observed
that
in
any
event
it
would
be
possible
to
reframe
that
kind
of
tombstone
permission.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
not
under
the...
not
under
massachusetts
regulations.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
but
the
distinction
is
between
advertising
and
merely
information
identifying
that
a
product
is
sold
here.
i
did
want
to
say
that
this,
unlike
pornography,
is
commercial
speech,
and
so
it
is
open
to
the...
more
open
to
the
possibility
that
alternate
avenues
of
communicating
with
adults--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--except
for
somebody
who
thinks
there's
no
distinction
between--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--yes.
the--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--yes.
the
principle,
as
i
understand
your
hypothetical,
is
that...
is
a
distinction
between
a
wide
variety
of
possible
health
dangers
and
a
health
danger
of
unparalleled
magnitude
that...
for
which
the
window
of
time
between
14-1/2
and
18
is
the
critical
window.
it's
the
average...
the
evidence
is
that
the
average
child
begins
smoking
at
14-1/2,
and
that
very
few
people
begin
after
18,
and
that
the
product
is
addictive,
so
if
you
have
a
14-1/2-year-old
child,
as
i
do,
and
you
can
get
that
child
to
18
without--
