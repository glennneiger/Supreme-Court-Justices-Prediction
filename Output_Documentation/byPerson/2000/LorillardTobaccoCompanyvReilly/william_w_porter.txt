mr.
william
w.
porter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioners
argue
that
congress
has
expressly
preempted
the
states
from
passing
any
law
that
limits
the
location
of
cigarette
advertising.
if
that
view
is
correct,
no
state
or
locality
may
forbid
cigarette
advertising
at
the
town
little
league
field,
or
cigarette
billboards
which
overlook
its
elementary
schools.
mr.
william
w.
porter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
w.
porter
yes.
nothing
in
the
act
compels
the
result
that
petitioners
urge.
instead,
congress'
main
purpose
in
the
cigarette
labeling
act
was
to
provide
a
uniform
national
health
warning
for
cigarette
packages
and
cigarette
advertising,
and
to
avoid
burdening
cigarette
manufacturers
with
conflicting
warning
requirements
that
might
be
set
by
the
states.
section
5(b)
protects
these
specific
interests
by
preempting
only
those
state
laws
that
dictate
the
health-related
information
in
or
with
respect
to--
mr.
william
w.
porter
--your
honor,
we
would
urge
that
section
5(b)
should
and
must
be
construed
in
the
context
of
the
act
as
a
whole.
i
think
your
honor's
question
points
out
the
possibility
of
alternative
constructions,
but
the
problem
with
section
5(b)
is
exactly
that.
it's
ambiguous,
and
its
ambiguity
comes
from
the
fact
that,
when
read
in
isolation,
one
does
not
know
at
what
level
of
generality
to
apply
the
phrases
in
section
5(b).
mr.
william
w.
porter
well--
mr.
william
w.
porter
--your
honor,
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
we
would
argue,
defines
or
provides
a
specific
meaning
to
section
5(b).
mr.
william
w.
porter
and
the
words,
based
on
smoking
and
health,
are
what
limit
the
scope
of
preemption
to
the--
mr.
william
w.
porter
--the
answer,
your
honor,
is
that
the
phrase,
based
on
smoking
and
health
in
section
5(b),
should
obtain
a
more
objective
meaning
than
that,
and
the
objective
meaning
comes
from
construing
that
phrase
in
the
larger
context
of
the
act
as
a
whole,
otherwise,
what
we
have
is
a
situation
where
the
phrase,
based
on
smoking
and
health,
really
does
become
virtually
unlimited.
it
is
a
phrase
potentially
of
great
breadth
when
construed,
as
petitioners
have,
in
isolation,
and
referring
to
any
health
concern
that
might
arise
in
the
motivation
behind
the
statute
or
in
any
health-related
effect
of
an
advertise...
of
a
state
law
respecting
cigarette
advertising.
mr.
william
w.
porter
two
things,
your
honor.
again,
i
think
a
close
look
at
section
1331,
the
statement
of
purpose,
indicates
that
what
congress
was
trying
to
achieve
is
to
obtain
control
over
the
health-related
information
in
cigarette
advertising,
and
we
see
that
with
specific
language
in
section
1331,
where
congress
says,
we're
going
to
provide
a
warning
and
we
want
to
avoid
nonuniform
laws,
advertising
laws,
and
now
i
quote,
with
respect
to
any
relationship
between
smoking
and
health.
mr.
william
w.
porter
your
honor,
i
think
that
what
is
significant
is
what
congress
didn't
change
in
1969.
your
honor
is
correct
that
the
1965
preemption
language
preempted
statements
relating
to
smoking
and
health.
the
phrase,
relating
to
smoking
and
health,
has
an
objective
meaning
in
that
provision.
it
clearly
refers
to
the
health-related
content
of
the
statement.
the
phrase,
relating
to
smoking
and
health,
was
retained
essentially
unchanged
in
1969.
mr.
william
w.
porter
your
honor,
i...
the
1969
amendments
clearly
did
expand
the
possible
forms
of
regulation
that
could
be
preempted,
but
it
still
retained
the
focus
on
health-related
content
by
virtue
of
the
retention
of
the
phrase,
based
on
smoking
and
health.
in
addition,
your
honor,
the
fact
that
congress
at
the
same
time
prohibited
advertising
on
television
and
radio,
i
don't
think
provides
any
basis
for
an
inference...
i
think
it
would
be
a
great
stretch
to
infer
from
that
that
congress
was
invading
the
traditional
authority
of
the
states
to
regulate
the
location
of
advertising.
mr.
william
w.
porter
your
honor,
i
don't
think
we
should
infer
a
deal
of
that
type.
at
the
same
time,
considering
the
environment
in
1969,
and
this
is
apparent
in
the
legislative
history,
congress
was
concerned
in
general
with
the
prevalence
of
tobacco
advertising
and
what
to
do
about
a
warning.
it
provided,
ultimately,
for
a
warning
in
advertising.
it
did
prohibit
advertising
on
television
and
radio.
but
what
you
see
in
the
legislative
history
is
a
great
concern
that
the
advertising
dollars
that
were
saved
when
tv
advertising
stopped
would
simply
migrate
to
other
places.
well,
congress...
that
concern
is
expressed
throughout.
it
would
be
unlikely
that
in
the
face
of
that
kind
of
concern,
at
the
same
time
congress
would
pass
a
preemption
provision
that
would
essentially
guarantee
tobacco,
cigarette
advertisers
the
right
to
advertise
anywhere.
mr.
william
w.
porter
yes.
mr.
william
w.
porter
here
are
two
examples,
your
honor--
mr.
william
w.
porter
--yes,
on
the
state's
reading.
the
court's
holding
in
cippolone
illustrates
that
the
addition
of
the
words,
require...
requirements
or
prohibitions,
allows
the
potential
for
preemption
of
certain
common
law
claims.
prior
to
that,
when
the
word
in
the
1965
law
was
statements,
only
positive
enactments
could
be
preempted,
and
then
on
the
back
end
of
the
provision--
mr.
william
w.
porter
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
w.
porter
i'm
simply
mentioning
that
in
the
cippolone
decision,
much
of
the
decision
was
devoted
to
determining
whether
the
addition
of
the
words,
requirements
or
prohibitions
in
1969,
what
was
the
effect
of
that,
and
the
court,
the
plurality
determined
that
those
new
words
provided
for
the
possibility
of
preemption
of
common
law
claims.
mr.
william
w.
porter
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
william
w.
porter
i'm
only
describing--
mr.
william
w.
porter
--the
cippolone
holding.
just
to
finish,
the
words
at
the
end
of
the
provision
in
the
advertising
were
changed
to,
with
respect
to
advertising.
the
vango
media
case
from
the
second
circuit
is
a
good
example
of
the
effect
of
that
provision.
in
vango
media,
a
law
was
held
preempted
which
required
cigarette
advertisers,
every
time
they
published
four
ads,
to
add
a
fifth
anti-tobacco
ad
totally
outside
of
any
cigarette
advertising,
and
the
court
held
that
was
with
respect
to
advertising,
but
it
was
preempted.
mr.
william
w.
porter
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
the
phrase,
in
the
advertising,
would
have
limited
the
scope
to
the
four
corners
of
a
pro-tobacco
advertisement.
i
think
that
would
be
the
natural
reading
of
it,
so
beyond
that--
mr.
william
w.
porter
--your
honor,
if
the--
mr.
william
w.
porter
--that's
where
it
becomes
difficult,
but
if
there
is
a...
if
the
basis
for
that--
mr.
william
w.
porter
--if
it's
a
regulation
of
the
health-related
content--
mr.
william
w.
porter
--yes.
mr.
william
w.
porter
yes,
that
would
be
preempted.
mr.
william
w.
porter
yes.
mr.
william
w.
porter
if
the
regulation--
mr.
william
w.
porter
--yes.
mr.
william
w.
porter
if
it's
a
regulation
of
the
health-related
content,
it
is
preempted,
and
under
that--
mr.
william
w.
porter
--it
appears
that
it
would
be,
your
honor.
mr.
william
w.
porter
and
that's
fundamentally
different,
your
honor.
mr.
william
w.
porter
because
they're...
the
act
is
not
sufficient
to
go
that
last
step.
what
doesn't
happen
is...
what
congress
was
intending
to
do
is
to
require
a
warning,
a
uniform
warning
that
the
states
couldn't
tinker
with,
anywhere
that
advertising
was
otherwise
permitted.
but
congress,
there's
no
indication
in
the
act
that
congress
was
attempting
to
invade
local
control
as
had
been
traditionally
exercised
over
the
location
of
commercial
advertising,
and
so
there's
a
fundamental
distinction
between
a
location
base,
really
a
zoning
style
ad,
and
one
where
the
state
is
invading
the
content--
mr.
william
w.
porter
--in
considering--
mr.
william
w.
porter
--if
we're
only
considering
that
issue
with
respect
to
preemption,
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
william
w.
porter
if
the
question
is,
could
advertising
be
prohibited
in
all
locations,
purely
under
the
preemption--
mr.
william
w.
porter
--a
good
example
of
that,
your
honor,
is
utah
in
the
1920's
did
exactly
that.
the
utah
law
has
been
in
effect
continuously
since
the
1920's.
it
raised
no
concerns
in
congress
when
the
cigarette
labeling
act
was
passed.
mr.
william
w.
porter
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
since
1969
the
utah
law
has
been
continuously
in
effect.
the
tobacco
industry
has
never
challenged
it.
it
was
not
raised
as
an
issue
in
congress.
in
fact,
senator
frank
moss
of
utah
was
an
ardent
foe
of
tobacco,
and
yet
was
one
of
the
senate
managers
of
the
cigarette
labeling
act.
mr.
william
w.
porter
utah...
utah--
mr.
william
w.
porter
--excuse
me.
utah
had
prohibited
essentially
fixed
advertising--
mr.
william
w.
porter
--on
billboards.
mr.
william
w.
porter
we
would
submit
that
it
wouldn't
have
been,
given
his
views
on
tobacco,
but
if
i--
mr.
william
w.
porter
--i
think
it
makes
it
more
clearly...
it
clarifies
any
ambiguity
that
the
hypothetical
may
have
had,
yes,
your
honor.
if
i
may,
in
my
time,
turn
to
the
first
amendment.
these
regulations
meet
each
requirement
in
the
central
hudson
test,
and
would
present
exactly
the
wrong
case
for
the
application
of
strict
scrutiny.
as
some
of
the
questions
have
pointed
out,
tobacco
advertising
concerns
an
addictive
product,
and
there's
ample
evidence
that
that
advertising
stimulates
demand
for
the
product,
which
is
illegal
for
sale
to
children
in
all
50
states.
these
regulations--
mr.
william
w.
porter
--a
critical
distinction,
your
honor,
is
that
these
regulations
prohibit
advertising
that
children
will
see
unavoidably,
day
in
and
day
out,
as
they
walk
to
and
from
school.
the
playboy
entertainment
case,
for
example,
related
to
indecent
speech.
the
court
found
that
there
was
a
less-restrictive
alternative
there,
because
an
individual
household
could
block
the
receipt
of
the
sexually
explicit
transmissions.
here,
parents
have
no
opportunity
to
block
tobacco
advertising
the
children
will
see
as
they
walk
to
and
from
school
and
the
park
each
day.
that's
the
critical
distinction
in
this
case,
and
it's
the
evidence--
mr.
william
w.
porter
--yes,
your
honor,
it's
exactly
that
notion,
that
to
the
extent
they
were
time-channeling
in
that
case,
massachusetts
is
channeling
of
a
different
type,
but
it's
focused
on
the
places
that
we
know
children
will
be
day-in
and
day
out,
and
that's
why
the
tailoring...
that's
why
these
regulations
are
narrowly
tailored,
is...
there's
been
no
argument
from
the
cigarette
companies
that
children
are
not
in
the
areas
we've
targeted.
their
only
comment
is
to
say
that
sometimes
those
arguments...
those
areas
might
overlap
and
aggregate
to
a
larger
space,
but
the
point
is,
is
that
massachusetts
has
focused
its
efforts
in
the
right
place.
mr.
william
w.
porter
only--
mr.
william
w.
porter
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
w.
porter
only
the
signatories
to
the
master
settlement
agreement
are
the
major
cigarette
manufacturers.
it
does
not
cover
smokeless
tobacco
or
cigar
manufacturers,
but
your
honor
is
correct,
under
that
agreement,
the
exception...
and
the
advertising
that
is
still
allowed
is
advertising
at
retail
locations
that's
under
14
square
feet--
mr.
william
w.
porter
--the
issue,
your
honor,
is
simply
that
in
1990
the
tobacco
companies
voluntarily
decided
to
stop
advertising
on
billboards
that
are
located
within
500
feet
of
schools
or
playgrounds.
that,
we
would
submit,
is--
mr.
william
w.
porter
--your
honor,
the
process
of
line-drawing
is
one
that
was
considered
carefully,
and
we
would
submit
is
the
state's
to
do...
massachusetts
here
adopted
the
number
that
the
fda
had
proposed,
which
translates
to--
mr.
william
w.
porter
--in
the
master
settlement
agreement,
all
outdoor
advertising
is
prohibited,
regardless
of
where
it's
located,
with
the
exception
of
advertising
at
retail
that's
14
square
feet
or
smaller.
that,
i
must
point
out,
is
a
significant
exception
to
the
master
settlement
agreement.
the
ftc
report
that
came
out
just
a
month
or
two
ago
indicates
a
significant
increase
in
cigarette
advertising
at
retail
locations
since
the
execution
of
the
master
settlement
agreement,
so
that
the
advertising
dollars...
it
also
indicates
that
total,
aggregate
advertising
by
the
cigarette
companies
is
at
its
largest
level
ever.
that
shows
two
things.
that
shows
there
are
plenty
of--
