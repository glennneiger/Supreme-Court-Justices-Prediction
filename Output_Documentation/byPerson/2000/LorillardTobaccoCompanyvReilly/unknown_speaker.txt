unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
it
on
the
face
of
the
statutory
scheme,
of
the
massachusetts
scheme
that
tells
us
that
it
is
based
on
health?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i--
unknown
speaker
--before
we
get
into
the...
on
the...
if
i
look
at
this
on
its
face,
what
tells
me
that
it's
based
on
health?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
want
me
to
go
to
motivation
again.
i
want
to
stay
with
the
statutory
scheme.
can
you
help
me
with
that
at
first?
unknown
speaker
just
from
an
objective
standpoint,
why
is
this
based
on
health?
unknown
speaker
so
the
fact
that
the
surgeon
general's
warning
cannot
be
advertised
in
conjunction
with
a
proposal
for
a
commercial
transaction
means
that
health
is
adversely
affected?
unknown
speaker
other
than
the
elimination
and
the
unavailability
of
the
surgeon
general's
warning,
are
there
any
other
objective
and
not
subjective
or
motivational
features
that
i...
that
show
that
this
is
based
on
health
that
i
can
determine
from
the...
by
looking
at
the
regulatory
scheme
itself?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
the
very
fact
that
they
applied
this
to
tobacco
advertising
and
no
other
kind
of
advertising
suggests
something
peculiar
about
tobacco
that
they
didn't
like.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sutton
what
are...
the
response
to
that
was...
or
one
response
to
that
was
in
the
massachusetts
brief,
and
it
said,
look,
in
the
real
world,
any...
as
the
chief
justice
suggested,
any
advertising
ban
or
lmitation
directed
to
tobacco
is
going
to
be
based
on
smoke...
on
the
relationship
between
tobacco
and
health.
we
recognize
that.
they
said,
however,
if
you
read
the
ban
that
broadly,
if
you
read
the
preemption
that
broadly,
rather,
then
the
words
of
limitation,
which
are...
which
refer
to
smoking
and
health
are
going
to
have
no
limitation
at
all,
becasue
it's
going
to
include
everything,
and
therefore
you've
got
to
pull
back
or
the
words
become
meaningless.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose--
unknown
speaker
--i
suppose
if
it
were
directed
solely
to
tobacco,
it
wouldn't
be
confused
with
a...
it
wouldn't
be
thought
to
raise
a
conflict
with
the
general
zoning
law,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
would
assume...
it
would
assume
that
the
state
laws
would
be
interpreted
to
mean
that
they
were
intended
to
modify
zoning
laws
rather
than
intended
to
regulate
tobacco,
and
i
don't
know
that
that
would
have
been
a
realistic
interpretation,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
you're
talking
about
general
zoning
laws
that
preclude
not
just
tobacco
billboards
but
all
billboards.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
very
indirect
way
for
the
congress
to
accomplish
that
objective,
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
rather,
it
could
have
said,
specifically
directed
to
cigarettes,
and
that
would
have
done
it
just
as
easily.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose,
though,
that
here
the
state
might
say,
what
we're
concerned
about
is
underage
smoking.
do
you
say
that
the
state
laws
that
prohibit
children
from
smoking
are
invalid
somehow?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
not
that
the
state
has
to
address
all
aspects
of
the
problem,
but
is
the
state
not
entitled
to
do
something
about
promotion
and
advertising
to
the
extent
that
it
encourages
underage
people
to
smoke?
unknown
speaker
well,
and
these
laws
have
some
of
that
in
there.
for
instance,
the
requirement
that
to
sell
cigarettes
it
has
to
be
a
person-to-person
transaction.
you
can't
get
it
from
a
vending
machine,
in
order
to
protect
children.
unknown
speaker
okay,
so
now
what
we
have
is
outdoor
advertising,
in
effect,
which
the
state
says
would
encourage
children
to
smoke,
so
they
want
to
restrict
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
may
be
limits
on
advertising
of
some
kind.
that's
what
we're
dealing
with
here,
so
i
think
the
focus
on
smoking
and
health
may
be
just
slightly
off-base
here.
unknown
speaker
but
when
you
read
the
federal
statute,
it
does
seem
to
be
directed
more
toward
what
has
to
be
on
cigarette
labels
than
anything
else.
i
mean,
they
didn't
want
a
whole
conflicting
array
of
state
requirements
of
how
the
package
had
to
be
labeled.
unknown
speaker
but
then
you're
saying
it
has
to
be
federal
authority,
the
ftc,
and
the
fda,
at
the
time
they
thought
they
might
regulate
nicotine
as
a
drug--
unknown
speaker
--also
had
a
similar
ban,
as
i
understand
it.
if
there's
doubt
on
this,
as
to
how
this
should
be
interpreted,
doesn't
the
presumption
against
preemption
of
state
control
prevail,
and
isn't...
has...
it's
not
just
the
first
circuit
who
has
said
no
preemption...
isn't
that
so?
unknown
speaker
how
many
circuits
have
held
that
there
is
no
preemption
of
size
and
location
regulations?
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
allowing
states
to
regulate
the
location
and
the
size,
of
signs.
unknown
speaker
there
are
four
circuits
that
have
held
that
there
is
no
preemption
of
that.
they
may
have
given
different
reasons,
but
four
have
said
that
the
states'
authority
has
not
been
taken
away
from
them
by
the
federal
government.
unknown
speaker
so
would
you
like
this
court,
then,
to
send
it
back
and
say,
first
circuit,
consider
the
theories
that
other
courts
of
appeals
have
accepted?
unknown
speaker
can
i
go
back
to
your
first
point?
you
started
off
saying
this
is
a
ban,
and
suppose
hypothetically
i
were
to
think
that
it's
okay
for
the
state
to
regulate
location,
but
not
okay
for
them
to
ban
all
advertising.
then,
at
that
point,
you
get
to
your
maps.
you
have
a
number,
and
you
have
the
maps.
when
i
saw
the
number,
i
thought,
well,
this
is
a
ban,
because
90
percent
of
the
area
can't
advertise.
then
i
looked
at
the
maps.
it
didn't
seem
to
me...
i
can't
make
heads
or
tails
out
of
them.
i
would
have
thought
the
right
question
is,
of
the
area
previously
available
for
advertising,
in
how
much
of
that
area
can
you
no
longer
advertise
as
a
result
of
this,
and
i
can't
get
an
answer
to
that
question
from
the
map,
and
the
map
only
covers
boston
and
not
the
suburbs.
it
doesn't
cover
the
suburbs
of
worcester.
i
mean,
most
of
the
population
of
massachusetts,
i
don't
know
what
the
situation
is...
we
now
have
those
maps...
and
yet
i
think
it's
very
important
to
your
argument,
on
my
assumption.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
saying
legitimate
or
not,
but
in
my
own
mind,
i
thought
the
relevant
distinction
turned
on
taking
the
area
previously
available
for
advertising.
what
percentage
of
that
area
was
cut
off?
i
take
it
i
cannot
get
an
answer
to
that
question
in
the
state
of
massachusetts.
unknown
speaker
so
i
cannot
get
a...
even
a
guess
as
to
whether
this
is
more
a
ban,
which
sounds
like
content,
or
more
like
location,
which
sounds
like
not
content.
unknown
speaker
but
my
question
is
about
maps--
unknown
speaker
--what...
is
there
anything
you
can
say
that
can,
in
the
light--
unknown
speaker
--so
then,
if
i
thought
my
question
was
important,
then
the
answer
would
be...
and
i'm
not
saying
it
is,
but
if
i
came
to
that
conclusion,
i
would
then
have
to
think,
we
should
send
it
back
to
get
this
fact
developed.
unknown
speaker
just
before
you
do,
mr.
sutton,
i
want
to
double-check
on
one
assumption
i'm
making.
you
referred
a
minute
ago
to
a
quid
pro
quo
relatinoship
between
subsection
(a)
and
subsection
(b).
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any...
i
have
assumed...
there
is
no
indication
in
the
record,
but
i
will
ask
you,
is
there
any
indication
in
the
legislative
record
that
there
was
in
effect
a
legislative
agreement
between
the
tobacco
companies
and
the
people
who
were
pushing
the
legislation
that,
in
response
to
withdrawing
tobacco
company
opposition
to
some
things
that
the
companies
didn't
like,
there
would...
they
would
be
rewarded
by
a
preemption
ban
as
broad
as
you
are
arguing
for?
unknown
speaker
they...
to
put
it--
unknown
speaker
--did
they
make
a
deal
to
get
what
you
say
they
are
entitled
to
under
(b)?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sutton,
with
respect
to
that
trade-off,
as
you've
described
it,
i
take
it
now
you're
making
a
transition
to
first
amendment.
unknown
speaker
if
i
read
you
correctly
on
your
strict
standard,
then
that
ban
on
radio
and
television
would
flunk,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
on
your
theory
of
strict
scrutiny
of
federal
restrictions,
on
what
basis
could
the
ban
on
television
and
radio
survive,
other
than
the
embrace
of
the
tobacco
people,
who
say,
well,
we'll
put
up
with
it?
unknown
speaker
what's
your
case
authority
for
the
proposition
you
just
stated,
mr.
sutton?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
need
to
argue
that
in
order
to
prevail,
do
you?
i
mean,
just...
you
began
by
saying
that
since
this
prohibits
all
adult
speech,
isn't
that
more
extensive
than
necessary
under
the
central
hudson
test?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sutton,
may
i
tell
you
why
i
at
least
am
concerned
about
your
saying
this
is
like
any
other
commodity,
but
it
really
isn't.
i
mean,
we're
dealing
with
a
commodity
that
is
like
no
other.
this
is
highly
addictive,
and
especially
dangerous
to
children,
who
can
get
hooked
at
age
13,
and
can't
get
off
it
for
the
rest
of
their
lives,
so
it
isn't
like
even
sticks
and
stones
can
break
my
bones,
bad
words.
unknown
speaker
but
my
question
to
you
is,
can't
you
make
a
distinction
with
respect
to
the
danger
of
the
product
and,
in
that
respect,
i
don't
know
anything
else
that's
lawful
to
sell
that's
like
cigarettes.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
changes
the
approach
a
little
bit.
justice
ginsburg
points
out
that
it's
addictive
and
therefore
dangerous
from
that
standpoint.
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
equate
that
with
vice,
and
i
think
that
slides
away
a
little
bit
from
the
thrust
of
her
concern.
unknown
speaker
well
my
question
to
you
is,
is
it
legitimate
to
say
there
is
something
about
this
commodity
that's
not
true
of...
some
people
are
compulsive
gamblers,
but
most
people
aren't.
some
people
are
sensitive
to
alcohol,
but
most
people
aren't,
but
this
is
a
drug
that
most
people
will
be
addicted
to
if
they
get
hooked
on
it.
unknown
speaker
but
has
the
state
tried
to
tailor
it
by
saying
we're
going
to
prohibit
it
where
it's
near
places
that
children
congregate,
schools
and
parks,
and
within
a
certain
distance
we're
going
to
be
concerned
about
advertising
cigarettes?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
message
that
the
advertising
tries
to
convey?
unknown
speaker
just
brand
loyalty,
that's
all--
unknown
speaker
--that's
at
issue?
unknown
speaker
you
were
saying
that
the
only
advertising,
then,
that
could
be
targeted
under
a
properly
tailored
scheme
is
an
ad
which
literally
had
a
juvenile,
literal
juvenile
appeal,
you
know,
smart
kids
smoke,
wind
in
the
willows
characters
with
cigarettes?
you're
not--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
i
mean,
it
can't
be
that...
i
mean,
it
can't
be
that
narrow,
so
what
is
it
about
the
content
that
could
be
better
targeted
to
children
than
simply
the
content
of
cigarette
advertising
which
gives,
tries
to
give
the
message
that
it's
a
nice
and
sophisticated
thing
to
smoke?
i
mean,
what--
unknown
speaker
--well,
if
that
were
the
case,
then
all
cigarette
advertising
would
simply
have
brand
names,
or
the
photographs
of
the
cigarette
packages,
and
it
would
not
have
people
in
cowboy
suits
or
people
in
bars
or
people
in
beaches
doing
sophisticated
and
healthy
things,
and
that's
just
not
the
way
the
advertising
is--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
sutton,
i
understand
you
were
prepared
to
acknowledge
that
the
state
could
ban
ads
that
say,
smoking
ain't
so
bad,
it's
worth
it.
could
the
state
ban
adults
from
receiving
advertising
of
that
sort?
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
necessity
of
narrowing
the
ban
to
children
who
hear
the
terrible
message
would
exist
whether
it's
just
brand
loyalty
or
smoking's
a
good
thing,
right?
i
assume
you're
entitled
to
say,
smoking's
okay.
unknown
speaker
but
you're
not
entitled,
you
say,
to
say
smoking's
a
good
thing
within
20
feet
of
a
school.
unknown
speaker
what
is
it
here,
1,000--
unknown
speaker
--so
what
is...
isn't
it
a
question
of
degree?
this
is
not
a
legal
product
in
respect
to
children.
unknown
speaker
so
you
yourself
concede
that
it's
okay
to
ban
ads
from
the
air,
from
television
and
radio.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
and
so
then
it's
just
a
question
of
degree.
that
is,
to
what
extent
are
there
other
avenues
for
advertising.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
there
are
many,
so
i
just
want
to
get
your--
unknown
speaker
--but
you're
not
arguing
that
the
agreement
precluded
this.
you're
not
saying
that
the
attorney
general
was
breaking
the
agreement.
unknown
speaker
you're
not
saying
that
he's
estopped.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't...
i'm
not...
i
have
to
say
i
don't
think
your
argument
is
sound.
he
could
not
say
that
with
respect
to
the
areas
covered
by
the
agreement.
what
he
is
saying
is
that
there
are
dangers
that
justify
the
ban,
and
those
dangers
exist
outside
the
area
covered
by
the
agreement.
unknown
speaker
then
your
argument
is
that
he
doesn't
have
any
evidence
that
would
justify
a
regulation
beyond
the
scope
of
the
regulation
in
the
settlement.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
it
is
not...
but
your
argument
is
not
that
the
settlement
covered
what
he
claims.
you're
saying
his
evidence
does
not
justify
doing
what
he
claims,
in
addition
to
the
settlement.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
who
is
bound,
and
to
what
extent,
by
this
msa?
unknown
speaker
who
is
bound,
and
to
what
extent?
unknown
speaker
these
petitioners
are
not
part
of
the
agreement?
unknown
speaker
so...
but
there
are
at
least...
everything
that
you've
said
about
the
agreement
doesn't
apply
to
the
tobacco
sellers,
manufacturers
who
are
not
party
to
the
agreement.
unknown
speaker
and
that
goes
for
the
smokeless
tobacco
and
cigars
as
well?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
sutton.
mr.
porter,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
what...
i'm
having
trouble
hearing
you.
do
you
want
to
speak
up--
unknown
speaker
--a
little
bit?
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
that...
your
proposition
is
by
no
means
clear
from
just
a
reading
of
section
5(b).
i
mean,
certainly
it
could
be
read
more
broadly.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
how
your...
what's
your...
how
do
you
want
it
read?
that
is,
i
have
the
words
in
front
of
me,
and
i
took
you
as
having
wanted
it
read
as,
with
respect
to
the
information
contained
in
advertising,
or
the
content
of
advertising,
but
maybe
there's
a
different
way
to
read
it.
unknown
speaker
how
specifically
do
you
want
us
to
read
it?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
this
isn't
based
on
smoking
and
health?
i'd
find
it
hard
to
say
that
with
a
straight
face.
i
don't
know
what
i'm
supposed
to
say
about
that.
of
course
they're
doing
this
because
they
feel
there's
a
bad
relationship
between
smoking
and
health.
what's
the
answer
to
that?
unknown
speaker
assume
for
argument's
sake
i
agree
with
everything
you
say.
it's
wonderful.
i'm
faced
with
this
language.
now
you
tell
me
how
to
read
it
to
get
to
the
place
that
you
want
to
get
to.
now,
that's
where
i...
it
says
you
can't
have
a
regulation
based
on
smoking
and
health
and
i'm
beginning,
naively,
to
think,
if
this
isn't
based
on
smoking
and
health,
what
is,
and
so
therefore,
however
i
might
feel
about
it,
that's
what
the
language
says.
now,
i
want
you
to
tell
me
what,
in
your
view,
i
would...
supposed
to
be
doing.
unknown
speaker
mr.
porter,
i
don't
think
that
on
its
face
it
says
that.
it
does
say
the
broader
thing
on
its
face,
but
i'm
especially
struck
by
the
fact
that
this
language
amended
an
earlier
text
which
did
say
exactly
what
you
say
this
new
text
says.
the
old
text
said,
no
statement
relating
to
smoking
and
health
shall
be
required
in
the
advertising
of
any
cigarettes.
they
could
have
simply
tracked
that
language
and
said,
no
state
shall
require
any
additional,
or
prohibit
in
the
advertising
of
any
cigarettes.
they
went
out
of
their
way
to
change
that
text
into
this
broad
text.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
as
justice
scalia
has
pointed
out,
it
did
amend
and
broaden
the
preemption
provision
at
the
same
time
that
it
banned
all
advertising
in
electronic
media.
now,
maybe
the
inference
from
that
is
that
it
left
out,
congress
wanted
to
leave
out
billboard
and
print
media
advertising,
let
that
not
be
covered.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
it
may
well
have
been
part
of
the
legislative
deal.
look,
this
happened
in
1969,
over
30
years
ago.
public
attitudes
regarding
cigarettes
were
not
nearly
what
they
are
today.
it
was
much
more
controversial
as
to
how
much
you're
going
to
move
against
them.
i
don't
know
what
the
legislative
deal
was,
but
there's
always
a
deal
going
on
there,
give
me
this,
i'll
give
you
that
and
so
forth.
the
best
way
to
tell
what
the
fair
deal
was,
it
seems
to
me,
is
to
read
the
text
of
the
statute,
and
this
is
phrased
as
a
very
broad
ban
against
the
states
going
beyond
the
electronic
media
ban
that
was
contained
in
the
statute.
that's
what
it
reads
like,
it
seems
to
me,
and
if
that
was
the
deal,
it
seems
to
me
we
should
enforce
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
could
you
put
it...
could
i
ask
you
to
put
it
this
way.
i'm
looking
on
page
15
of
the
government's
brief
that
sets
out
the
text
of
the
predecessor
section,
the
one
that
justice
scalia
quoted.
it
starts
by
saying,
no
statement
relating
to
smoking
and
health
shall
be
required
in
advertising,
and
so
on.
you
acknowledge
that
at
least
that
has
been
broadened
to
the
extent
of
saying,
no
statement
shall
be
required
or
prohibited,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
where
you
come
out
is
to
say
that
the
new
section
means
basically
what
the
old
one
did,
except
that
it
adds
prohibited
to
required.
what
more,
on
your
view,
does
the
new
section,
does
the
new
preemption
section
preempt?
unknown
speaker
on
your
reading.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
statement
doesn't
refer
to
the
governmental
prohibition.
it
doesn't
refer
to
whether
it's
a
statute
or
a
common
law
case.
it
says,
no
statement
relating
to
smoking
and
health
shall
be
required.
unknown
speaker
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
common
law
versus
legislation,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
had--
--which
a
mere
reference
to
statement
would
not
do?
that's
your--
unknown
speaker
--well,
but
it
says
statement
shall
be
required.
why
wouldn't
required
embrace
the
common
law
as
well
as...
i
don't
see
any
difference.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
that
wouldn't
have
been
possible
under
the
phrase,
in
the
advertising?
unknown
speaker
would
it
have
preempted,
in
your
view,
the
new
one,
the
one
we're
talking
about?
supposing
massachusetts
passed
a
law
which
said,
every
cigarette
pack
sold
in
every,
or
let's
say
every
billboard
ad,
has
to
take
out
the
word
cigarette,
take
out
the
word
tobacco.
you
can
advertise
as
you
want.
you
can't
have
certain
words
in
it.
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
say,
talk
about
health.
the
reason
they
don't
want
it
is
because
they
think
cigarettes
are
bad
for
you,
and
they
don't
want
people
to
know
what
they
are.
now,
is
that,
in
your
view,
preempted?
unknown
speaker
the
reason
is
the
following.
we
want
the
word
cigarette
and
tobacco
taken
out,
because
we
don't
want
people
to
buy
them
because
it
will
kill
them,
all
right.
that's
why
they
do
it.
now,
what's
the
answer?
unknown
speaker
i'm
telling
you
what
it
is.
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
know
what
your
answer
is.
is
that
preempted
or
not,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
if
that
is
preempted,
then
suppose
they
say,
it
has
to
be
blank,
the
ad,
blank.
now...
because
we
don't
want
people
to
know
what
it
is,
we
don't
want
them
to
buy
it,
because
it's
dangerous.
now,
is
that
preempted?
unknown
speaker
i'm
telling
you
the
reg.
i've
given
you
the
reg.
unknown
speaker
that's
just
what
it
is.
the
words
in
this
ad
are
to
be
nothing,
okay.
that's...
is
that
preempted?
unknown
speaker
i'm
asking
you,
is
my
example
preempted,
in
your
opinion?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
then
they're
saying,
and
if
you
say
no
billboard
at
all,
that's
the
same
thing.
unknown
speaker
because?
unknown
speaker
well,
just
to
make
sure...
i
think
this
was
justice
breyer's
hypothetical.
can
massachusetts
ban
all
cigarette
advertising,
period?
unknown
speaker
massachusetts
says,
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
you
cannot
advertise
cigarettes
anywhere,
on
any
billboard,
or
on
any
store
sign.
unknown
speaker
but
i
can't,
to
be
honest
with
you--
--you
think
massachusetts
can
do
that
under
this
language?
unknown
speaker
every
ad
in
every
location
is
banned
for
cigarettes
in
massachusetts,
that's
not
preempted?
unknown
speaker
there
was
no
preemption
law
in
the
twenties
either,
was
there?
unknown
speaker
what
did
utah
do
about
radio
and
television
advertising
of
cigarettes?
unknown
speaker
did
it
prohibit
that,
too?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
so
that
might
have
been
a
pretty
good
deal
for
mr.
moss,
to
get
all
this
stuff
off
of
radio
and
television,
where
it
does
a
lot
more
harm
to
kids,
and
the
risk
being
that
the
billboard
prescription
would
be
overturned.
i...
that
doesn't
seem
like
a
bad
deal
to
me.
unknown
speaker
suppose
in
the
hypothetical
case,
where
massachusetts
bans
all
advertising
at
any
location
of
all
cigarettes,
it
recites,
because
of
our
concerns
with
health,
all
advertising
of
cigarettes
is
banned
in
the
state
of
massachusetts,
would
that
be
preempted?
unknown
speaker
you
can
say
the
same
thing
about
pornography,
and
we've
been
very
picky-picky
about
what
the
federal
government
or
any
state
can
do
with
regard
to
pornography,
for
the
very
purposes
that
you're
talking
about,
too,
by
way
of
keeping
it
away
from
children.
we've
been
very
insistent
that
you
can't
keep
it
away
from
adults,
although
a
lot
of
people
think
it's
addictive
and
harmful.
unknown
speaker
is
it
like
the
seven
dirty
words
case
in
that
respect,
that
you
had
to
stop
it
for
the
adult
at
that
time
of
day,
as
well
as
for
the
child,
because
there's
no
way
to
make
it
safe
for
the
adult
without--
unknown
speaker
--well,
as
a
practical
matter,
i
guess,
billboards
are
not
at
issue,
because
they're
dealt
with
by
the
agreement,
right?
unknown
speaker
so
what
we're
really
dealing
with
here
are
the
little
signs
on
a
store,
for
instance.
unknown
speaker
a
storefront
sign.
unknown
speaker
but
don't
we
have
an
issue
here
between
billboards
more
than
500
and
less
than
1,000
feet
from
the
schools?
unknown
speaker
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
about
a
750-foot
billboard.
unknown
speaker
and
is
that
the
number
in
the
agreement,
too?
is
it
1,000
feet
in
the
agreement?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
porter.
general
underwood,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
a
rule
that
says
you
can't
advertise
at
all
a
rule
that
prohibits
claims
based
on
smoking
and
health?
unknown
speaker
would
you
explain...
to
make
that
clear
to
me,
would
you
explain
to
me,
as
i
asked
your
brother
to
do,
what,
then,
on
your
view,
the
differences
are
between
the
old
preemption
section,
assuming
that,
what
was
it,
prohibition
had
been
added
to
requirement,
and
the
new
preemption
section?
unknown
speaker
so
the
old
law
was
thought
to
have
no
application
to
implicit
statements.
unknown
speaker
nonverbal
suggestions.
unknown
speaker
general
underwood,
what
is
your
paraphrase
of
what
this
statute
means,
no
requirement
or
prohibition...
you
don't
want
to
say,
based
on
smoking
and
health.
you
want,
no
requirement
or
prohibition,
what?
unknown
speaker
that
regulates
assertions
about
smoking--
unknown
speaker
--and
you
think
that
based
on
smoking
and
health
is
a
reasonable
way
to
say,
that
regulates
assertions
of?
unknown
speaker
how
are
these
regulations
based
on...
the
ones
that
you
say
are
prohibited,
how
are
they
based
on
health?
unknown
speaker
but
one
change
in
the
statute
was
that
the
'69
statute
was
just
based
on...
just
applies
to
state
laws
and
the
'65
statute
applied
to
state
and
federal.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
general
underwood,
in
the
few
minutes
remaining,
do
you
think
you
could
give
us
a
1-minute
explanation
of
your
views
about
the
first
amendment
issues?
unknown
speaker
if
there
was
a
prohibition
as
to
all
advertising,
would
that
be
no
more
extensive
than
necessary,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
and
if
that
were
the
practical
effect
of
this
regulation
because
of
the
1,000-foot
dynamic,
would
that
change
your
answer?
unknown
speaker
general
underwood--
unknown
speaker
--what
is
the
government's
position
on
a
state
law
that
prohibits
adult
bookstores
from
having
a
sign
in
the
front
which
says,
adult
bookstore,
or
a
sign
that
says,
pornography
on
sale
here--
unknown
speaker
--because
of
the
concern
for
children?
i
mean,
adults
are
entitled
to
get
the
pornography.
now,
can
an
adult
bookstore
just...
this
statute,
you
can't
even
say,
tobacco
for
sale.
unknown
speaker
can
you
say,
marlboro?
unknown
speaker
you
can't
say
marlboro,
okay,
so
the
bookstore
says...
you
know--
unknown
speaker
--general
under--
unknown
speaker
--general
underwood,
just
one
assumption.
let's
assume
that
it
can
be
demonstrated
that
eating
regularly
at
fast
food
joints,
including
mcdonald's,
causes
health
problems
throughout
life
for
kids,
would
you
give
me
the
principle
in
your
reasoning
that
would
prevent
the
state
of
massachusetts
from
similarly
restricting
advertising
by
mcdonald's--
unknown
speaker
--that
is
directed
exclusively
to
kids?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
general
underwood.
i
think
you've
answered
the
question.
mr.
sutton,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
