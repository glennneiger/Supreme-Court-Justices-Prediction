souter
but
you
leave
one
thing
out
in
your
argument,
at
least
i
think
you
do,
and
that
is
in
this
case
the
compacts...
the
compact
was
entered
into
specifically
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
individual
water
users
as
well
as
for
protecting
whatever
the
sovereign
interest
of
the
state
as
such
was,
so
that
the...
i
think
the
reading
that
you're
trying
to
give
it
ignores
the
object
of
the
compact
in,
frankly
in
protecting
the
farmers.
