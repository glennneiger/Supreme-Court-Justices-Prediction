unknown
speaker
why
should
any
prejudgment
interest
be
awarded
as
between
states?
i
mean,
this
is
based
on
a
compact,
isn't
it,
this
lawsuit?
unknown
speaker
and
is
there
any
provision
in
the
compact
for
the
provision
of
prejudgment
interest?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
common
law
rule,
i
assume,
is
that
you
don't
award
prejudgment
interest
for
unliquidated
damages.
unknown
speaker
oh,
but
as
between
state
sovereigns,
i
mean,
who
is
going
to
pay
the
bill
in
colorado?
it's
the
taxpayers,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
the
taxpayers
of
the
state
of
colorado
will
end
up
footing
the
bill,
and
it
just
seems
odd
to
me
that
we
would
all
of
a
sudden
craft
some
rule
allowing
prejudgment
interest
against
a
sovereign
state.
i
mean,
the
states
presumably
had
ample
opportunity
to
negotiate
at
the
time
of
the
compact
for
the
kinds
of
things
that
should
go
into
a
damages
award
in
the
event
of
a
breach.
unknown
speaker
did
they
just
assume
that,
what,
normal
contractual
remedies
would
be
applied?
unknown
speaker
was
that
the
very
first
case
in
which
damages,
money
damages
were
even
awarded
in
one
of
these
original
jurisdiction
cases?
unknown
speaker
the
point
wasn't
even
contested
here,
was
it?
both
sides
wanted
to
resolve
the
case
with
monetary
payment
instead
of
with
water,
so
that's
hardly,
you
know,
solid
precedent
for
the
proposition
that
money
damages
are
awardable.
unknown
speaker
right,
and
this
is
the
first
case
we've
had
where
that
conflict
has
been
presented
to
us.
one
of
the
parties
doesn't
want
to
pay
money
damages.
unknown
speaker
and
if
we
didn't
allow
money
damages,
i
presume
it
would...
and
if
one
of
the
parties
would
prefer
monetary
damages,
i
presume
they
could
negotiate
it
out
and
pay...
i
mean,
colorado
could
negotiate
it
out
and
pay
money
instead
of
water.
unknown
speaker
i
know
they're
not,
but--
--if
money
damages
were
not
awarded,
and
some
form
of
water
relief,
then
you
have
a
master
who's
there
forever
and
administering
the
thing
at
great
cost,
often,
to
the
parties,
so
money
damages
have
that
to
recommend
them.
unknown
speaker
it's...
the
interest
question
was
never
adjudicated
before,
but
you're
saying
as
well
the
damages
question
was
never
adjudicated,
because
last
time
around
both
parties
said
that's
what
they
wanted.
unknown
speaker
if
you
want
to
get
a
check
instead
of
water,
you
can
always
negotiate
that
out.
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--so
i
mean,
and
that
wouldn't
put
the
burden
on
us
to
try
to
figure
out
how
you
compute
money
damages
for
failure
to
deliver
water.
i
mean,
that's
one
of
the
big
issues
in
this
case,
i
suppose,
isn't
it?
you're
going
to
get
to
that,
whether
we
compute
the
losses
to
the
farmers
of
kansas
from
the
failure
to
have
more
water
delivered.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
your
argument
for
interest
here
is
that
there
were...
that
the
money...
i'm
sorry,
that
the
water
you
didn't
get
in
the
45
years
in
which
the
violations
went
on
is
translatable
into
crop
loss,
crop
loss
is
translatable
into
money
and,
in
order
to
be
made
whole
on
the
money,
you
should
be
made
whole
on
the
loss
of
use
of
the
money.
i
mean,
that's
your
interest
argument,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
did
you...
was
there
an
inflationary
factor
added
so
that
the
damages,
say
for
the
early
sixties
were
computed
in
1995
or
year
2000
dollars?
unknown
speaker
but
the
people
who
are
paying
are
really
the
present
taxpayers,
and
they're
paying
for
something
that
older
generations
of
taxpayers
maybe
didn't
do,
and
it
could
be
horrendous
amounts,
if
you
have
a
violation
that's
200
years
old,
as
you
could
in
a
different
case.
rather
than
getting
into
all
that,
why
wouldn't
we
assume
that
the
states
didn't
want
to
unless
they
said
it
specifically
in
the
compact?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
i
suppose
it's
nobody's
fault,
you
know.
it
just...
what
i
vision,
and
i
want
the
answer
to
this,
and
i'll
exaggerate
it,
but
hoards
of
lawyers
in
state
attorneys
generals
offices
combing
through
the
files
of
ancient
documents
looking
for
violations,
primarily
to
receive
for
the
state
treasury
vast
amounts
of
money
coming
out
of
compound
interest.
i
mean,
you
see,
that's
the
horror.
now,
what
prevents
that
from
happening,
once
we
get
into
the
habit
of
awarding
prejudgment
interest?
unknown
speaker
is
it
the
case
that
there
is
no
market
for
an
acre
foot
of
water
in
kansas?
is
there
such
a
price
today
that
could
be
paid
if
a
farmer
were
to
go
out
and
buy
water
from
another
farmer
who
had
some?
would
there
be
a
price
paid
per
acre
foot?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
today's
world
i
think
we
all
are
aware
that
water
can
be
severed
from
the
land
and
sold,
so
much
an
acre
foot,
for
application
on
a
different
piece
of
land.
unknown
speaker
well,
presumably
you'd
take
the
current
value
and
then
adjust
for
values
in
earlier
times.
unknown
speaker
it
just
seems
like
such
a
complicated,
not
obvious
measure
of
damages.
i
was
just
struck
by
how
strange
it
was,
really,
to
try
to
measure
damages
here
in
dollars
based
on
some
estimated
crop
loss
to
individual
farmers.
unknown
speaker
does
kansas
have
the
riparian
system
of
water
rights,
or
the
appropriated
system?
unknown
speaker
there's
one
thing
on
the
question
of
how
far
the
compound
interest
could
compound
that
i
don't
understand,
and
i
was...
i
want
to
ask
the
other
side
the
same
question,
but
maybe
you
can
explain
it.
as
i
understand,
the
master
decided
that
the
interest
ought
to
run
from
1969,
which
was
the
date
upon
which
each
side
either
knew
or
should
have
known
that
a
violation
of
the
compact
was
taking
place.
unknown
speaker
the
master
also
decided
that
there
had
been
no
undue
delay
on
the
part
of
kansas
in
not
instituting
suit
for
another,
what
was
it,
17
years,
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
indeed.
the
two
dates,
or
the
findings
with
respect
to
the
two
dates
struck
me
as
being
at
least
possibly
in
tension.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
kansas
would
have
been
obligated
to
file
suit,
of
course,
in
1969,
the
year
that
it
first
knew
or
should
have
known,
but
it
also
seems
the
case
that
there
was
rather
a
long
gap
between
that
time
and
the
time
that
kansas
actually
did
institute
suit,
and
yet
the
master
found
no
undue
delay.
now,
all
of
this
may
be
relevant
if
we
determine
that
interest
should
run
and
try
to
come
up
with
some
determination
about
how
to
take
the
point
at
which
it
begins
to
run.
is
there
some
tension
between
the
knew
or
should
have
known
in
'69,
and
the
no
undue
delay
for
a
lawsuit
that
wasn't
filed
for
17
years?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
unaware
in
fact,
even
if
the
plaintiff
should
have
been
aware?
unknown
speaker
okay.
in
response
to
my
question,
my
concern
that
they
would
dig
up
old
claims
and
then
have
horrendous
interest,
you
said,
well,
there's
a
lot
of
discretion
in
the
master
to
prevent
that
from
happening.
that's
what
he
did
here.
he
said,
we're
not
going
to
give
you
the
money
between
1950
and
1968.
now
you're
complaining
about
that,
so
if
he
doesn't
have
discretion,
then
why
isn't
my
horrendous
imaginary
hypothetical
a
real
problem?
unknown
speaker
well,
fine.
if
it's
complete
compensation,
then
we're
back
to
my
problem,
which
is
digging
up
very
old
claims
from
1780
or
something,
and
we
discover
that
all
of
the
taxpayers
of
massachusetts
are
going
to
pay
$5
billion
to
new
hampshire
because
they
found
a
claim
from
1782
and
there's
compound
interest.
unknown
speaker
yes,
that's
what
i'm
interested
in,
the
cases
where
you
can't
say
laches.
they
dig
up
some
good
claim,
and
now
you
previously
said
they
have
a
lot
of
discretion
on
the
prejudgment
interest
part.
now
you're
saying
they
don't
have
discretion
on
the
prejudgment
interest
part.
unknown
speaker
mr.
draper,
why--
--certainly
somebody
bringing
a
200-year-old
claim
would
find
a
formidable
barrier
in
the
doctrine
of
laches,
would
they
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
draper,
could
i
come
back
to
justice
souter's
question?
i
don't
understand
how
it
is
that
kansas
should
not
have
known
enough
to
bring
the
suit
until
1987,
but
colorado
should
have
known
that
it
was
wrongfully
taking
too
much
water
17
years
before
that?
it
seems
to
me
the
two
should
go
hand
in
hand.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
can
that
be?
the
whole
purpose
of
the
common
law
rule
against
prejudgment
interest
for
unliquidated
claims
was
because
of
lack
of
knowledge
to
the...
by
the
defendant.
that
was
the
whole
reason
for
the
common
law
rule,
and
if
that's
the
reason,
then
you're
asking
us
to
adopt
a
new
rule
here.
how
could
colorado
have
known
about
prejudgment
interest
in
an
interstate
compact
dispute?
unknown
speaker
so
shouldn't
that,
mr.
draper,
mean
that
there
should
be
some
modification?
you
say
the
common
law
rule
has
been
abandoned
in
many
states
because
it's
illogical,
the
distinction
between
liquidated
and
unliquidated
damages.
on
the
other
hand,
as
justice
o'connor's
starting
questions
indicated,
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
peculiar
animal,
a
suit
between
two
states,
so
why
do
you
insist
that
you
take
the,
what
would
be
the
rule
for
an
ordinary
contract
in
the
state
that's
abandoned
the
liquidated
nonliquidated
and
take
that
over,
jot
and
tittle,
to
the
interstate
suit?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that...
doesn't
that
sort
of
beg
the
question?
if
we
start
with
the
assumption
that
there
is
some
discretion
over
the
matter
of
interest,
why
couldn't
we
resolve
the
tension
between
the
findings
with
respect
to
those
two
dates
with
a
rule
like
this,
that
interest
will
be
awardable
from
the
time
at
which
the
violation
either
was
or
should
have
been
known,
and
from
the
time
after
that
at
which
suit
was
instituted,
to
avoid
the
problem
of
allowing
a
state,
as
apparently
kansas
did
here,
to
sit
on
its
rights
from
1969
to
whatever
it
was,
1977?
unknown
speaker
'87.
'87,
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
that,
but
why
shouldn't
he
have?
i
mean,
it
just
seems
odd
whether
the
delay...
call
the
delay
undue
or
not,
the
fact
is
there
was
a
17
or
18-year
delay
from
the
time
at
which
kansas
could
have
brought
this
lawsuit.
why
should
kansas
be
rewarded
with
interest
for
that
delay,
even
if
it
was
not
undue?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr
draper.
mr.
minear,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
when
you
get
to
the
second
point,
and
i
don't
mean
to
spoil
your
order,
but
will
you
sort
of
take
up
where
we
left
off
on
the
problem
that
we...
some
of
us
seem
to
be
having
in
finding
that
there
was
knowledge,
or
should
have
been
knowledge
in
'69.
we
don't
have
a
suit
for
a
couple
of
decades,
and
interest
is
piling
up.
that's
our
problem,
and
i...
so
will
you
address
that
when
you
get
to
point
2?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
realize
that.
did
he,
did
the
master
specifically
find
that
kansas
was
not
under
an
obligation
to
have
known
in
'69?
unknown
speaker
did
not
know
in
fact?
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
colorado
did
not
know
in
fact,
but
he
found
that
colorado
should
have
known
in
'69.
did
he
make
a
finding
that
it
was
not
the
case
that
kansas
should
have
known
in
'69?
unknown
speaker
it
would
seem
the
same
would
apply.
i
mean,
people
from
kansas
never
go
to
colorado?
i
mean,
what's--
unknown
speaker
--i
mean,
why
can't
we
just
make
the
assumption
that
if
one
side
knew
or
should
have
known,
the
other
side
knew
or
should
have
known?
unknown
speaker
farmers
know
who's
drilling
wells,
and
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
let's
assume,
just...
and
i
think
we've
got
your
point,
but
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
kansas
would
have
been
under
the
same
duty
to
know
that
colorado
was,
and
that
'69
is
the
date.
the
case
as
it
comes
to
us,
i
take
it,
is
a
case
in
which
there
is
no
question
about
kansas
being
thrown
out
of
court
for
suing
too
late,
but
it
may
well
be
that,
by
waiting
so
long
to
sue,
kansas
should
not
be
entitled
to
the
same
running
and
compounding
of
interest
that
it
would
have
been
entitled
to
if
it
had
sued
more
promptly
after
the
1969
date.
why
shouldn't
we
take
that
possibility
into
consideration
in
fashioning
the
rule
as
to
when
the
interest
starts
to
run?
unknown
speaker
mr.
minear,
one
thing
seems
to
have
gotten
lost
in
this
discussion.
i
thought
that
it
was...
when
colorado,
or
perhaps
kansas,
knew
that
kansas
water
was
being
depleted,
and
when
you
were
able
to
prove
in
court
how
much,
wasn't
there
something
in
the
record
that
until
there
was
computer
modeling
you
couldn't
estimate
with
any
degree
of
accuracy--
unknown
speaker
--how
much
was
involved,
and
that
wasn't
until
the
eighties.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
couldn't
they
have
brought
a
suit
in
equity
to
stop
depletion,
and
if
they
had
done
that,
the
damages
wouldn't
be
running,
we
wouldn't
have
the
interest
question.
unknown
speaker
so
the
fact
that
they
may
not
have
been
able
to
prove
the
precise
predicate,
which
is
the
modeling
predicate
for
the
computation
of
money
damages
now,
doesn't
prove
that
they
shouldn't
have
sued
earlier.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
not
do
the
simplest
thing?
they're
states.
they
can
say
what
they
want
in
the
compact.
just
say,
the
traditional
common
law,
no
interest
on,
no
prejudgment
interest
on
unliquidated
damages,
or
whatever,
applies,
we
assume
it
in
the
contract,
compact,
unless
they
work
it
out
and
say
to
the
contrary.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
mean
colorado
can't
turn
around
and
give
it
to
the
kansas
users
who
had
been
deprived
of
it,
if
they're
still
around?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
so
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
these
users
just
suing
colorado
themselves?
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
they
don't.
let's
assume
it
would
violate
the
eleventh
amendment
for
these
farmers
who
are
deprived
of
the
water
to
sue
colorado.
why
does
it
make
any
sense
to
allow
kansas
to
sue
on
their
behalf,
and
then
turn
around
and
give
them
the
money?
unknown
speaker
why
shouldn't
the
measure
of
damages,
then,
relate
to
what
kansas
as
a
state
lost?
it
did,
in
part,
lost
income
taxes
and
that
kind
of
thing.
i
mean,
why
would
the
measure
be
specifically
what
each
farmer
would
have
lost
in
terms
of
dollars?
unknown
speaker
i
can
understand
that,
but
it's
hard
to
know
why
the
measure
of
money
damages
should
be
based
strictly
on,
or
in
part
on
what
the
individual
farmer
would
have
lost
if
the
state
doesn't
plan
to
turn
around
and
give
it
to
the
farmer.
unknown
speaker
why
does
the
united
states
have
any
position
or
interest
as
to
what
kind
of
damages
colorado
pays
kansas,
or
the
eleventh
amendment,
for
that
matter?
unknown
speaker
why
is
that?
where
does
that
interest
stem
from?
unknown
speaker
but
does
the
award
of
damages
from
colorado
to
kansas
in
any
way
affect
the
government's
operation
of
those
upstream
reservoirs?
unknown
speaker
well,
my
problem
is,
if
you
do
it
in
this
kind
of
suit,
which
is
under
a
compact,
i
presume
you
would
have
to
do
the
same
thing
in
a
parens
patriae
suit
by
a
state
against
another
state,
wouldn't
you?
wouldn't
you
apply
the
same
rule?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
robbins,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
what
page
is
that
on?
unknown
speaker
are
you
now
summarizing
article,
section
(d),
mr.
robbins?
unknown
speaker
but
they
had
a
report
done,
which
kansas
didn't.
didn't
they
have
a
report
done?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
it
was
clear
from
that
study
that
flow
would
be
affected,
wasn't
it?
i
mean,
you
didn't
have
to
be
a
water
expert
to
understand
that
the
inevitable
consequence
of
that
study
was
that
you
were
taking
water
from
the
river.
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
you've
also
got
a
finding
which
you
seem
to...
i
think
you
want
to
ignore
here,
that
you
should
have
known
in
'69.
what
do
we
do
with
that?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--okay,
but
is
that
properly
before
us
here?
unknown
speaker
i
hadn't
realized
your
claim
went
that
far,
but
i
will
assume
it
does.
unknown
speaker
and
what's
your
position
after
1985?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
shoe
were
on
the
other
foot,
and
colorado
was
suing
some
other
state?
unknown
speaker
when
i
suggested
that,
the
government
said...
it
sounded
sensible.
they
said,
well,
the
prejudgment
interest
rule
has
always
been
the
common
law,
just
part
of
the
common
law,
and
why
should
we...
and
you
ought
to
just
stick
to
that.
unknown
speaker
so
your
basic...
one
part
of
your
basic
rule
is,
if
the
plaintiff
isn't
barred
by
laches,
then
the
defendant
shouldn't
be
hit
with
prejudgment
interest.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
but
that
can't
be
the
whole
rule.
what's
the
principle
that
you
think
we
should
adopt
in
respect
to
prejudgment
interest
in
a
suit
between
two
states?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
other
words--
--unless
it's
specifically
mentioned
in
the
compact.
unknown
speaker
you
say
until
damages
are
liquidated.
until
there's
a
judgment,
then.
unknown
speaker
there
would
be
no
prejudgment
interest.
unknown
speaker
i
just
want
to
get
clear
on
the
point
that
you
and
i
discussed
a
minute
ago
on
your
exception
to
the
master's
finding
that
you
should
have
known
in
'69.
which
one
of
the
four
colorado
exceptions
raises
that
in
your
judgment?
three
seems
to
be
the
closest
to
it.
unknown
speaker
your
number
3.
unknown
speaker
okay.
what
number?
three.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
contest
post
judgment
interest?
unknown
speaker
but
that's...
and
that's
something
that
this
court
determined.
it
didn't
come
from
the
statute
that
governs
post
judgment
interest
for
district
courts.
unknown
speaker
so--
unknown
speaker
--you
want
us
to
say
that
we
should
apply
the
common
law
rule?
unknown
speaker
why
is...
should
that
be
different
from
what
we
held
in
the
milwaukee
case
for
admiralty?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
why
should
admiralty
as
a
general
classification
be
treated
differently
than
the
common
law?
of
course,
the
cases
will
always
differ.
unknown
speaker
have
varying
facts.
unknown
speaker
so
as
you
read
milwaukee,
if
two
ships
collide
there's
no...
well,
of
course,
i
don't
know
how
you'd
get
prejudgment--
unknown
speaker
--well,
but
if
you
say
the
facts
of
milwaukee
are
different
than
this,
i...
that
doesn't
answer
why
admiralty
and
common
law
should
go
on
two
different
paths.
unknown
speaker
i'm
asking,
why,
in
this
context
of
prejudgment
interest?
what
is
it
about
an
admiralty
case
that
makes
prejudgment
interest
proper,
and
not
in
a
common
law
case.
unknown
speaker
is
it
sophistication
of
the
parties
or
something?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
we
now
have
milwaukee,
that
confirms
that.
unknown
speaker
why
should
there
be
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
common
law
defendants
are
not
as
smart
as
admiralty
defendants?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
robbins,
i
think
that
your
point
is
that
the
states
thought
that
they
were
incorporating
common
law
rather
than
admiralty
law.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
your--
unknown
speaker
--well,
yeah,
but
i
mean--
--when
do
you--
--no,
but
i'm
asking
whether
there
should
be
a
difference.
unknown
speaker
we
have
a
hard
philosophical
question
before
us
in
distinguishing
milwaukee.
that's
the
point.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
provision
of
the
restatement,
which
came
out,
i
guess,
in
1932?
i
mean,
that
is
supposed
to
be
a
summary
of
common
law,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--oh,
i
don't
know
about
the
eleventh
amendment.
i
mean,
the...
but
the...
my
thought
was,
and
this
might
be
totally
wrong,
that
it
isn't
that
the...
you
know,
the
fact
that
something
was
done
in
the
middle
ages
is
not,
whoever
holmes
said,
a
reason
for
following
it,
so
let's
start
with
the
restatement
rule.
why
shouldn't
that
be
the
rule?
i
think
it
should
be
the
rule
in
normal
civil
cases.
if
there's
something
different
about
this
one,
it
must
stem
from
the
fact
that
in
a
very
old
case
what
we're
talking
about
are
two
groups
of
taxpayers,
neither
of
whom
was
around
at
the
time,
shifting
money
between
each
other
and
stirring
up
a
lot
of
trouble
between
their
states.
now,
is
there
a
basis
for
distinguishing
that
and
if
so,
what,
and
why?
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
discuss
that,
the
proper
measure
of
damages?
unknown
speaker
your
time's
flying
away
here,
and
you
haven't
said
a
word
about
it.
what
do
you
think
the
proper
measure
of
damages
should
be?
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
the
general
economy.
you
just
have
all
sorts
of
causation
problems
there,
if
you
try
to
prove
damage
to
the
general
economy,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
why
aren't
the
farmers'
losses
part
of
the
loss
to
the
general
economy?
i
gather
what
you're
considering
loss
to
the
general
economy
is
the
farmers
had
less
money,
and
therefore
didn't
buy
as
many
luxury
goods
at
the
grocery
stores.
i
don't
know
why
you
should
take
into
account
the
latter,
the
secondary
effect
of
this
taking
of
water,
and
not
take
into
account
the
former,
the
more
immediate
effect
of
it.
unknown
speaker
that's...
and
that's
what
i
want
to--
unknown
speaker
--well,
but
if
they
are
bound
by
it,
i
don't
see
why,
by
a
parity
of
reasoning,
their
interest
may
not
be
considered
in
valuing
the
violation.
in
other
words,
if
they're
bound
by
it
i
suppose
either
they
get
a
benefit
or
the
state
may
legitimately
measure
a
benefit
by
reference
to
their
interests.
you
want
to
have
it
one...
you
don't
want
to
have
it...
you
want
to
have
the
benefits
but
not
the
burden.
unknown
speaker
mr.
robbins,
i
was
thinking
when
you
were
making
the
argument
in
your
brief,
of
what
you
would
say
the
eleventh
amendment
means
in
the
kind
of
claim
you
say
that
the
secretary
of
labor
would
bring
against
a
state
for
violation
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
where
the
recovery
would
go
directly
into
the
pocket
of
the
affected
worker.
are
those
suits
impermissible
under
the
eleventh
amendment?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
isn't
the
compact
on
the
same
level
as
a
federal
statute?
congress
had
to
approve
it.
unknown
speaker
i
assume
it
has
the
status
of
a
federal
statute--
unknown
speaker
--so
i
assume
the
analogy
is
exact.
well,
the
united
states
can
sue
for
damages
without
an
eleventh
amendment
problem.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
the
united
states
can,
but
what
you're
saying
here
is,
it's
not
the
state.
you're
not
questioning
that
one
state
can
sue
another
without
an
eleventh
amendment
barrier,
but
you
say
what
makes
it
no
good
is
that
it's
for
the
benefit
of
the
farmers,
so
similarly,
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
the
united
states
is
suing,
but
if
you
apply
your
reasoning,
the
workers
are
the
same
as
the
farmers.
unknown
speaker
yes
but
in
this
case
there
is
not
a
claim
comparable
to
your
third
example.
in
this
case--
unknown
speaker
--was
there
a
compact
in
minnesota
v.
north
dakota?
