mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
would
like
to
address
two
issues
with
respect
to
the
master's
proposed
remedy.
first,
the
master's
calculation
of
damages
here
does
not
violate
the
eleventh
amendment
and,
second,
this
court
should
allow
prejudgment
interest
on
a
discretionary
basis
in
interstate
compact
suits.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i'd
be
happy
to
address
that
now,
in
fact,
to
preserve
the
continuity
of
the
argument.
your
honor,
first
of
all,
the
master's
finding
with
respect
to
knowledge
here
related
to
colorado's
knowledge,
and
not
kansas'
knowledge,
and
colorado
had
knowledge
that
there
was
the
prospect
of
some
violation
because
it
had
complaints
within
its
own
state
borders
with
respect
to
groundwater
pumping
depletion,
depleting
stream
flow
and,
as
you
may
recall,
that
is
the
basis
for
liability
here,
that
colorado
had
allowed
its
citizens
to
pump
groundwater
which
reduced
the
state
line
flow.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
he
found
that
kansas
did
not
know
at
that
time.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
did
not
know
in
fact.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
do
not
believe
that
he
did.
i
don't
believe
that
he
specifically
addressed
that
issue.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
it's
hard
to
say
what
the
state
of
knowledge
was
in
1968,
and
to
the
extent
there
was
some
lack
of
proof
here,
i
think
the
burden
would
fall
on
kansas
to
have--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
do
think
that
we
simply
can't
assume
that--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--on
the
other
hand,
though,
the
colorado,
for
instance,
had
commissioned
a
study.
it
had
done
its
own
internal
studies.
i
believe
in
1965
it
had
begun
to
license
groundwater
pumping,
so
it's
not
clear
that
everything
that
was
known
to
one
sovereign
would
necessarily
be
known
to
another
sovereign.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
it's
entirely
fair
to
take
that
consideration
into
account.
the
united
states'
view
with
regard
to
prejudgment
interest
is
that
it
should
be
allowed
in
interstate
compact
suits,
but
on
a
discretionary
basis,
based
on
the
facts
of
the
individual
case.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
that
also
there
was
difficulty
in
determining
exactly
how
much
water
had
been
depleted.
it
wasn't
clear
when
that
knowledge
was
available,
but
it
certainly
was
after,
we
believe,
1968.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
i
agree
with
that
as
well,
and
again
i
think
this
focuses--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor,
i
agree
with
all
of
the
points
that
are
being
made
here,
and
the
united
states
wishes
to
emphasize
the
principle
that
a
rigid
rule
one
way
or
another
with
regard
to
prejudgment
interest
is
what
ought
to
be
avoided
here.
we
do
think
these
factors
are
relevant
in
considering
what
is
the
appropriate
level
of
prejudgment
interest.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
doesn't
adequately
address
the
common
law
rule,
which
i
think
we
should
look
to
the
restatement
of
contracts
in
stating
the
rule
in
a
compact
case.
that's
the
closest
analogy
to
the
contract
situation,
and
in
the
restatement
of
contracts,
since
1932
the
rule
has
been
that,
where
damages
are
a
fixed
sum
of
money,
or
a
performance
that
has
a
fixed
value,
prejudgment
interest
does
apply,
but
in
those
cases,
in
all
other
cases
prejudgment
interest
is
applied
under
a
rule
of
reasonableness,
based
on
the
aspects,
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
case.
so
our
position
really
simply
suggests
that
the
restatement
rule
is
what
ought
to
be
applied
here.
both
states
would
have
been
on
knowledge
of
that
principle
as
a
background
principle
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
address
the
eleventh
amendment
issue,
because
i
think
that
also
merits
this
court's
concern.
the
master
properly
determined,
in
accordance
with
this
court's
decision
in
texas
v.
new
mexico,
that
kansas
is
entitled
to
money
damages
as
a
basis
for
colorado's
compact
violations,
as
a
remedy
for
the
compact
violations,
and
he
calculated
those
damages
by
determining
the
value
of
the
water
that
kansas
was
entitled
to
but
did
not
receive
and,
in
making
that
determination,
he
evaluated
the
cost
to
kansas
farmers,
which
was
reflected
in
two
matters,
increased
groundwater
pumping
costs,
and
also
lost
crop
production.
colorado
has
challenged
that
aspect
of
the
award
on
the
basis
that
it
violates
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
we
disagree.
our
view
is,
the
master's
determination
of
damages
here
was
simply
by
reference
to
what
the
water
was
worth
to
the
kansas
users,
not
to
provide
any
sort
of
compensation
for
the
kansas
users
themselves.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
you
mean,
could
kansas
turn
around
and
give
the
money--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
yes,
i
believe
that
kansas
could
do
that
if
they
wished.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
it's
not
clear
that
the
users
individually
have
a
claim
against
colorado.
kansas
does
have
its
own
claim
predicated
on
the
compact.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
because
kansas
is
not
suing
on
their
behalf.
kansas
is
suing
for
the
performance
that
was
due
to
it
under
the
compact.
kansas
is
asserting,
in
essence,
its
own
claim,
which
was
for
delivery
of
a
usable
quantity
of
water,
usable
water
at
the
state
line,
and--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
master
did
include
state
income
taxes
and
secondary
taxes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
your
honor,
the
reason
why
is,
we
have
to
determine
what
was
the
value
of
the
water
at
the
state
line,
and
as
you
pointed
out
before,
there
is
no
market
for
the
water
like
there
would
be
a
market
for
so
many
bushels
of
wheat.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
your
honor,
we
have
a
general
interest
in
these
original
actions
to
make
sure
that
there's
a
fair
allocation
of
damages
and
rights
and
responsibilities.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
are
parties
to
these
suits
frequently,
most
likely
in
issues
revolving,
involving
liability.
we
are
a
party
to
this
suit
because
of
our
operation
of
the
upstream
reservoirs.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
would
affect
them
if
it
were
repayment
in
water.
here,
money
is
being
used
as
a
substitute
for
water,
and
we
thought
it
appropriate
to
weigh
in
on
that
question
with
respect
to
the
position
that
the
master
has
taken,
and
our
position
is
very
simply,
simply
that
we
have
to
look
to
what
the
value
of
the
water
was
at
the
state
line.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
not
necessarily
your
honor,
because
the
compact
situation
involves
a
situation
where
there
is
a
clear
claim
by
the
state
under
the...
an
agreement
that
is
entered
into
by
the
states.
