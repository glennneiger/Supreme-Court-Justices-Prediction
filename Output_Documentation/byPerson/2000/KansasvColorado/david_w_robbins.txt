mr.
david
w.
robbins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
turn
initially
to
the
prejudgment
interest
issue,
since
that
seemed
to
drawn
the
court's
attention
early
on.
i
would
ask
you
to
look
at
article
4(d)
that
mr.
draper
drew
your
attention
to,
because
he
only
asked
you
to
read
the
second
half
of
article
4(d).
mr.
david
w.
robbins
that's
on
page
a-5
of
the
kansas
opening
brief.
article
4(d)
describes
for
the
parties
and
for
the
court
what
the
parties
actually
intended,
and
that
was
not
to
impede
or
limit
development
of
water
within
the
arkansas
basin,
subject
only
to
the
proviso,
both
states
understood
that
there
would
be
additional
development
within
the
basin,
and
both
states
understood
that
there
would
be
a
risk
that
that
development
might
cause
material
depletion
to
usable
flow.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
i
did
not
take
the
time
to
read
the
entire
article,
your
honor.
the...
later
in
the
compact,
in
the
enforcement
provision,
the
two
states
address
the
manner
in
which
they
are
going
to
determine
when
usable
flows
might
be
depleted
by
setting
up
an
interstate
agency
called
the
arkansas
river
compact
administration,
and
the
arkansas
river
compact
administration
is
charged
with
investigating
concerns
about
material
depletions
to
usable
flow.
there
was
no
contemplation
in
this
compact
that
colorado...
i
want
to
draw
a
distinction
between
other
compacts
that
states
have
entered
into,
the
colorado
river
compact,
where
the
obligation
to
deliver
water
is
set
out
at
75
million
acre
feet
over
10
years
by
the
upper
basin,
the
rio
grande
compact,
where
there
is
a
table
of
relationship
located
right
in
the
compact,
where
each
signatory
understands
what
it
must
do
each
year
to
comply
with
the
compact.
in
the
case
of
the
arkansas
river
compact,
there
was
no
obligation
on
the
part
of
colorado
to
deliver
a
particular
quantum
of
water
in
any
year.
rather,
both
states
sought
to
have
the
opportunity
to
continue
to
develop
unused
waters,
and
both
states
agreed
that
they
would
be
vigilant,
working
through
the
interstate
agency,
to
investigate
when
and
if
a
violation
or
an
under
delivery
was
occurring.
now,
no
investigation
was
requested.
under
the
compact,
under
article
7(h)...
8(h),
i'm
sorry,
until
1985.
prior
to
that
time,
both
states
cooperated
together
and
worked
together
on
the
operation
of
the
river.
neither
state
expressed
an
understanding
that
there
was
any
way
in
which
the
river
was
being
depleted
by
activities
in
colorado
or
in
kansas.
remember,
if
you
look
again
at
article
4(d),
it
applies
to
both
states,
not
just
colorado,
so
what
we
need
to
do
here
is
understand
what
the
deal
was,
and
the
deal
wasn't
that
colorado
was
automatically
guaranteeing
that
it
was
going
to
deliver
a
certain
amount
of
water
every
year,
which
would
be
what
would
be
assumed
by
the
argument
which
kansas
has
made,
and
therefore
failing
to
deliver
some
amount
over
a
40-year
period,
we
automatically
should
owe
them
significant
damages,
when,
in
fact,
the
concept
here
was
that
both
states
would
work
to
allow
full
development
of
the
system,
and
both
states
would
be
responsible
to
ensure
that
if
overdevelopment
occurred
in
one
or
the
other
state
that
affected
usable
flows,
an
investigation
would
be
undertaken
and
appropriate
enforcement
undertaken.
so
in
our
view,
at
a
minimum,
on
prejudgment
interest,
until
1985
colorado
knew
no
more
than
kansas.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
colorado
did.
the
master--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--absolutely.
we...
justice
scalia,
we
certainly
did.
that
report
did
not
deal
with
the
issue
of
material
depletion
to
usable
flow.
it
was
looking,
rather,
at
the
general
hydrology
in
the
basin.
it
did
not
look
at
other
impacts
that
were
affecting
the
flows
of
the--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--there
is
no
question
about
that.
your
point
is
exactly
well
taken,
but
remember,
we
were
entitled
to
take
additional
water
from
the
river
under
article
4(d),
subject
only
to
the
constraint
that
we
not
deplete
usable
flows
materially.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
justice
souter,
the
finding
that
the
master
made,
in
our
opinion,
is
contrary
to
this
court's
1995
ruling.
we
argued
in
1995,
the
two
states,
about
the
very
wheeler
report
upon
which
the
master
relied.
we
argued
that
that
report
should
have
given
the
states
notice
of
the
existence
of
a
potential
problem
under
the
compact,
and
this
court
found,
different
than
the
master's
first
report
to
you,
that
the
evidence
was
vague
and
conflicting.
it
is
our
view
that
in
fairness,
if
it
was
too
vague
and
conflicting
to
find
that
kansas
should
have
known
in
1969
and
brought
suit
at
that
time
if
it
was
concerned,
or,
better,
referred
it
to
the
compact
administration,
that
in
fairness
colorado
should
be
held
to
no
higher
standard
of
knowing
that
it
was
in
fact
depleting
usable
flows.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
you're
asking
us
to
actually
know
there
were
depletions
occurring
when
you
did
not
find
that
kansas
was
even
charged--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--i
believe
it
is,
yes.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
so
it
is
our
view
that
prejudgment
interest
ought
not
be...
if
you
are
to
consider
it
as
a
remedy
in
this
case,
it
ought
not
be
held
against
colorado
at
a
minimum
until
1985,
the
time
at
which
there
was
official
notice
that,
in
fact,
kansas
was
asserting
that
there
were
depletions
material
depletions--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--well,
i--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--i
do
not
believe,
justice
o'connor,
that
prejudgment
interest
is
appropriate
in
this
context
until
damages
are
liquidated.
there
was
no
contemplation
between
the
states
that
there
would
even
be
a
monetary
consequence
in
these
compacts.
there
might
be
injunctive
relief.
you
have
to
think
that
in
1949,
that
the
law
was
such
that
the
common
law
was
generally
accepted
to
be
damages
only
suffered,
prejudgment
interest
on
liquidated
damages.
the
parties
never
discussed
anything
to
do
with
damages
in
this
case.
the
parties
contemplated
only
that
they
would
work
together
through
this
interstate
agency,
the
compact
administration,
and
would
seek
to
ensure
that
depletions
to
usable
flow
didn't
occur.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
i
agree
completely
with
that,
and
i
think
the
cases
cited
by
my
loyal
opposition
are
not...
do
not
stand
for
the
proposition.
i
do
not
believe
the
city
of
milwaukee
v.
national
gypsum
stands
for
the
proposition
that
prejudgment
interest
is
applicable
in
every
dispute
that
involves
some
form
of
a
contract.
in
fact,
i
believe
that
stands
for
the
proposition
that
if
you
are
in
an
admiralty
circumstance,
and
if
you
know
or
should
have
known
that,
in
fact,
damage
had
occurred,
and
in
that
case
there
was
a
great
lakes
carrier
sitting
at
the
bottom
of
the
harbor,
and
the
good
faith
was
about
who
put
it
there,
not
the
good
faith
that
colorado's
talking
about
here
today,
which
was,
we
didn't
have
a
clue,
i
don't
think
it's
appropriate.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
if
we
don't
have
a
tolling--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--in
my
view,
until
a
damage,
the
damages
are
liquidated,
there
should
not
be
prejudgment
interest
in
this
case,
and
i
think
that's--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--unless
it's
described
in
the
compact,
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
well,
i--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--i
believe
that's
the
closest
one,
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
number
3.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
no,
ma'am.
you
determined
that
very
clearly
in
texas
v.
new
mexico.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
we're
not
here
to
argue
to
you
that
you
do
not
have
discretion
in
these
interstate
original
proceeding
actions.
you
do.
you
have
discretion
to
formulate
what
you
believe
to
be
is
the
appropriate
remedy.
i
think
you
made
that
very
clear
in
texas
v.
new
mexico
in
response
to
the
texas
claim
that
you
were
barred
from
awarding
post
judgment
interest
unless
there
was
a
statute
or
other
authority
to
grant
it,
so
i...
we
don't
dispute
that,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
well,
the
circumstances
are
very
different.
in
the
milwaukee
case
the
factual
circumstance
is
different.
there
was
knowledge
on
behalf
of
milwaukee.
their
good
faith
that
they
didn't
know
something
was--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--well--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--i
would
argue
to
the
court,
justice
kennedy,
that
the
situation
in
the
milwaukee
case
was
a
commercial
transaction.
in
this...
where
whatever
was
occurring
was
understood
to
involve
money
damages.
in
this
case--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--they
didn't
tie
the
ship
up
right,
and
the
argument
was
whether
the
wharfinger
had
failed
to
provide
an
adequate
berth,
or
whether
the
owner
of
the
ship
had
allowed
it
to--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--well,
they
always
have.
admiralty
has--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--for
over--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--for
over
150
years,
prejudgment
interest
has
been
a
part
of
admiralty
judgments.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
because
the
common
law
traditionally
viewed
the
necessity
of
the
defendant
understanding
that,
in
fact,
an
injury
was
occurring,
so
that
the
defendant
could
either--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--well,
i'm
afraid
i
can't
fully
illuminate
you
on
the
history
of--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--i...
there
is
absolutely
no
way
for
them--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--justice
scalia
to
have
done
anything
else.
thank
you.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
you're
asking
me
a
very
hard
philosophical
question.
i
can
only
respond,
justice
kennedy,
that
historically--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--i
can
say
that
in
my
judgment
the
states
did
not
contemplate
that
prejudgment
interest
was
to
be
considered.
in
fact,
they
didn't
even
discuss
damages.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
there
were
certainly...
there
have
certainly
been
cases
that
have
described
the
fact
that
there
was
no
rational
basis
in
a
commercial
transaction
between
awarding
prejudgment
interest
on
liquidated
damages,
but
not
doing
so
on
unliquidated
damages
if
the
intention
of
the
litigation
was
to
restore
the
plaintiff
fully
to
the
position
it
would
have
been
in.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
in
this
circumstance,
however,
that
doesn't
really
work
very
well,
because,
as
was
described
by
counsel
for
kansas,
the
damages
which
kansas
seeks
run
to
individuals,
and
kansas
seeks
the
money
from
the
general
treasury
of
the
state
of
colorado.
our
view
is
that
that,
in
and
of
itself,
works
a
problem
because,
as
we
understand
it,
the
eleventh
amendment
was
intended
to
protect
state
treasuries
from
enormous
damage--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--in
my
view,
the
distinction
is
that
the
agreement
that
was
reached
between
the
two
states
was,
1)
that
contemplated
the
states
would
work
together
to
ensure
that
additional
usable
flows
did
not...
depletions
to
usable
flow
did
not
occur,
and
that
there
was
no
contemplation
that
there
would
be
exchanges
of
money
between
the
two
states
as
a
result
of
the
compact.
there's
nothing
to
suggest
that
either
state
contemplated
or
discussed
the
fact
that
there
would
be
a
monetary
consequence.
colorado
acknowledges
this
court's
decision
in
texas
v.
new
mexico
that
damages
can
be,
under
certain
circumstances,
awarded
in
order
to--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--i
would--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--thank
you,
justice
scalia.
i
do
not
believe
that
texas
v.
new
mexico
addressed
the
standard
of
damages.
you
merely
made
the
statement
in
that
case,
this
court,
that
damages
would
be
appropriate,
and
would
be
appropriate
in
certain
circumstances
in
interstate
litigation.
the
proper
measure
of
damages
in
our
view
are
those
damages
which
represent
damages
to
the
sovereign
and
quasi
sovereign
damages
which
would
be
damages
to
the
general
economy.
we
do
not
agree,
and
strongly
disagree,
that
summing
the
individual
damages...
and
i
want
to
make
a
point
here.
we
disagree
with
the
united
states.
what
the
master
did
was
not
use
damages
to
farmers
as
a
measure
of
the
value
of
water.
you
will
see
in
his
report
that
he
specifically
found
that
he
was
relying
upon
the
specific
damages
to
those
farmers.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
the
reason
that
colorado
engaged
in
the
evidentiary
proceeding
to
determine
what
the
damages
were
to
farmers
and
to
the
farm
community
was
to
permit
the
assessment
of
general
damages,
and
the
master
made
a
finding
about
general
damage
to
the
kansas
economy
which
is
called
secondary
damages,
and
it
was,
in
fact...
that
number
was
derived
and
is
contained
in
his
report.
we
do
not
disagree
that
damages
to
the
general
economy
are
part
of
the
sovereign
and
quasi
sovereign
damages
that
the
state
of
kansas
suffered.
in
addition,
he
identified
and
found
the
amount
of
lost
tax
revenues
that
the
state
suffered,
which
in
our
view
is
also
an
appropriate
damage.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
the
problem
that
we
have
is
this.
in
north
dakota
v.
minnesota,
you
set
out
a
fairly
bright
line
between
what
a
state
could,
in
fact,
recover
in
the
way
of
damages
and
what
it
could
not.
in
this
case,
as
the
record,
as
the
briefs
made
clear,
if
you
calculate
the
specific
amount
of
damage
that
each
individual
suffered,
and
if
you
award
prejudgment
interest
on
the
rate
at
that,
that
that
individual
would
have
enjoyed
or
paid
if
he
had
had
the
money,
or
obtained
if
he'd
had
the
money,
and
you
add
all
that
up,
and
simply
say,
that
is
the
amount
of
money
that
the
state
of
kansas
is
entitled
to,
and
then,
reading
texas
v.
new
mexico,
you
say
a
state
can
decide
in
the
public
interest,
which
is
the
term
used
in
texas
v.
new
mexico,
they
can
return
that
money
to
the
individuals,
you
have
simply
permitted,
in
the
context
of
trying
to
determine
damages,
a
back
door
to
avoid
north
dakota
v.
minnesota.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
justice
souter,
i
have
a
different
take
on
article
7(a)
of
the
compact.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
and
the
reason
i
do
is
this.
all
compacts,
after
your
decision
in
hinderlider,
the
court's
decision
in
hinderlider
v.
la
plata
and
cherry
creek
ditch.
all
compacts
tie
the
interest
of
the
state
and
the
interest
of
the
water
users
together.
there
was
no
more
an
argument
within
this
country
whether
or
not
water
users
could
say,
my
interest
is
independent
of
the
state's
interest,
because
that
was
the
whole
issue
in
the
hinderlider
case.
what...
10
years
later,
when
this
compact
was
entered
into,
the
history
was
that
the
states
had
been
before
you
several
times.
the
last
time
it
involved
water
users
in
kansas
suing
water
users
in
colorado,
colorado
petitioning
for
this
court's
protection
to
stop
the
inter...
the
fight
between
the
individual
ditch
companies
and
individuals
in
the
two
states.
i
believe
article
7(a)
was
placed
in
the
compact
for
the
purpose
of
making
certain
that
all
of
the
people
in
the
arkansas
basin
who
were
going
to
be
bound
by
it
understood
on
the
face
of
the
compact
that
they
would
be
bound
thereby,
if
for
no
other
reason--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--we
understand
that
we
have
the
burden.
we
understand,
the
state
of
colorado
understands
that
it
has
to
deliver
water
to
the
state
of
kansas,
and
has
endeavored
to
do
so.
what
we
do
not
want
to
do
is
see
damages
paid
to
the
state
of
kansas
that
represent
individual
damages
impermissible
under
the
eleventh
amendment
from
being
brought
against
the
state,
summed
up,
and
paid
to
the
state
of
kansas.
in
my
view,
the
way
in
which
this
case
has
unfolded,
there
is
a
significant
risk,
if
one
assumes
that
allowing
a
state
to
distribute
any
damages
it
receives
in
the
public
interest,
that
a
state
can
simply,
by
clever
pleading,
fail
to
announce
that
it
is
seeking
the
damages
of
the
individuals.
that
was
not--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--that
is
pursuant
to
federal
statute,
and
that's
a
topic
that
i
know
this
court
has
had
a
significant
amount
of
debate
about.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
well--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--it
has
been
described--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--that's
correct,
and
it
has
been
described
as
a
federal
statute,
but
it
is
a--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--justice
ginsburg,
i
am
arguing
north
dakota
v.
minnesota
to
you,
which...
in
which
case
a
lawsuit
was
filed
by
the
state
of
north
dakota
against
minnesota.
they
claimed...
they
asked
for
three
things.
they
asked
specifically
for
an
injunction,
which
the
court
found
was
appropriate.
they
asked
for
proprietary
damages,
or
damages
to
the
state
itself,
which
the
court
found
was
appropriate,
and
they
asked
specifically
for
specific
damages
to
individual
farmers
who
were
injured
by
the
actions
of
minnesota,
and
the
court
found
that
was
inappropriate,
because
north
dakota
was
trying
to
stand
in
the
shoes--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--that
is
absolutely
correct,
and
that's
why
i
say
it
becomes
a
matter
of
pleading.
if
you
are
entitled
to
plead
generally,
and
not
speak
about
the
farmers
when
you
file
your
complaint,
but
simply
seek
their
damages,
and
those
damages
are
then
permissible
to
be
collected,
and
then
you
say,
under
texas
v.
new
mexico,
i
can
distribute
them
as
i
wish,
if
i
determine
it's
in
the
public
interest,
i
can
turn
around
and
give
them
back.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
there
was
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
thank
you
very
much
for
your
time.
