mr.
john
b.
draper
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you,
and
may
it
please
the8
court:
the
parties
are
here
on
exceptions
to
the
third
report
in
this
case.
after
the
court
determined
that
the
state
of
colorado
had
violated
the
arkansas
river
compact
in
1995,
the
case
was
returned
to
the
special
master
for
further
proceedings.
subsequently,
the
special
master
determined
that
colorado
had
violated
the
arkansas
river
compact
in
every
year
from
the
inception
of
their
compact
to
the
date
of
filing
of
this
case
in
1985.
he
further
determined
that,
since
the
filing
of
the
lawsuit,
that
colorado
has
continued
to
violate
the
compact
in
every
year
through
1996,
except
for
1987.
colorado
does
not
challenge
those
determinations.
each
of
those
determinations
is
in
the
unit
of
acre
feet.
altogether,
for
the
period
1950
through
1994,
the
period
at
issue
here
for
the
remedy,
he
determined
that
approximately
420,000
acre
feet
of
water
had
been
depleted
from
the
arkansas
river
by
colorado
and
its
water
users
in
violation
of
the
compact.
that
amount
of
water
is
about
125,000
times
the
size
of
this
courtroom,
or
a
column
the
size
of
this
courtroom
extending
upward
about
1,000
miles.
he
has
determined
that
the
proper
remedy
for
these
losses,
which
are
both
past
and
future,
because
of
the
lingering
effects
of
the
violations
by
colorado,
should
be
compensated
in
money
rather
than
in
water.
at
the
end
of
trial,
kansas
had
determined
that
its
losses
were
$62
million.
colorado's
corresponding
number
was
$9
million.
the
special
master
recognized
losses
that
we
calculate
to
be
approximately
$57
million.
however,
the
special
master
was
persuaded
by
colorado
not
to
accord
kansas
full
compensation
for
its
losses.
he
reduced
it
further
by
denying
part
of
the
prejudgment
interest
that
had
been
quantified
by
kansas
at
trial.
mr.
john
b.
draper
this
is
based
on
the
compact,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
b.
draper
no,
there
is
no
specific
provision
on
prejudgment
interest,
nor
is
there
any
provision
specifically
addressing
the
remedy,
just
as
there
was
no
provision
in
the
pecos
river
compact,
which
this
court--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--that
is
the
traditional
rule,
your
honor,
but
it
is
a
largely
discredited
rule
at
this
point
in
history,
and
the
court
has
recognized
that
most
recently--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--it's
the
state
of
colorado.
they
are
the
signatory--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--in
almost
every
case,
the
compacts
that
are
in
place
now
do
not
specify
the
precise
remedy,
or
in
most
cases
any
remedy
that
might
be
afforded
by
this
court.
mr.
john
b.
draper
i
think
that
is
the
correct
analysis,
your
honor.
the
court
has
said
in
1987,
in
the
texas
v.
new
mexico
litigation,
that
the
contract
remedies
should
be
looked
to
to
determine
the
proper
remedy
for
breach
of
a
compact.
mr.
john
b.
draper
that
is
the
first
case,
your
honor,
in
which
the
prospect
of
money
damages
for
violation
of
an
interstate
water
compact
were
allowed.
there
was
not
a
specific
amount
at
that
time.
the
court
returned
the
case
to
the
special
master,
and
it
was
settled
before
further
determination
was
necessary.
mr.
john
b.
draper
in
this
case,
your
honor,
if
i
understood
your
point,
colorado
took
the
position
initially
that
compensation
should
be
in
water,
without
interest.
the
state
of
kansas
took
the
position
that
it
should
be
in
money
with
interest.
mr.
john
b.
draper
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
b.
draper
that's
correct,
and
colorado
is
not
challenging
the
determination
by
the
special
master
here
that
the
remedy
should
be
in
money.
mr.
john
b.
draper
money
damages
certainly
has
that
to
recommend
them,
your
honor.
it's
hard
to
tell
whether
we're
receiving
the
water.
you
look
at
the
river,
and
colorado
says,
that's
your
water
coming
down
in
payment
for
our
past
violations.
i
can
tell
when
we
get
a
check.
i'm
not
so
sure
when
i'm
looking
at
water
in
the
river.
mr.
john
b.
draper
last
time
around
it
was
not
clear
that
the
parties
were
in
agreement
on
the
possibility
of
money
damages,
but
this
court
ruled
that
that
was
an
option
that
should
be
considered
by
the
special
master.
mr.
john
b.
draper
that's
true,
and
we're
asking
for
a
check.
mr.
john
b.
draper
yes.
there's
no
dispute
at
this
point
in
the
case,
your
honor,
that
the
compensation
should
be
paid
in
money.
that,
as
your
honor
alludes
to,
was
quantified
by
kansas
in
large
part
by
assessing
the
injuries
suffered
by
the
water
users
in
kansas,
mostly
irrigating
farmers.
the
approach
was
taken
to
assess
the
losses
in
value
suffered
by
the
water
users
in
kansas
because
we
had
no
ready
market
for
water
to
which
we
could
turn
for
the
value
of
an
acre
foot
of
water
in
1950,
1951
and
so
on.
if
we
had
that,
that
would
have
been
the
most
direct
way
to
do
it.
mr.
john
b.
draper
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
b.
draper
yes.
mr.
john
b.
draper
for
the
years
that
were
denied
prejudgment
interest
treatment,
1950
through
1968,
the
special
master
did
adjust
those,
at
the
suggestion
of
colorado,
not
on
the
basis
of
principle,
but
simply
because
colorado
was
not
objecting
to
that.
those
are
adjusted,
which
is
only
a
fraction
of
the
time
value
of
money
that
occurred
from
that
period
to
the
present.
mr.
john
b.
draper
your
honor,
there
are
limits
to
keep
such
amounts
from--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--becoming
too
large.
the
principle
that
was
largely
addressed
in
the
last
time
that
the
case
was
before
the
court,
that
is,
laches,
the
question
was,
was
there
unreasonable
delay
in
prosecuting
kansas'
claim
by
kansas?
that
was
contested--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--the
court
has
stated
that
the
determination
of
prejudgment
interest
is
subject
to
the
court's
discretion.
it
is
also
subject
to
consideration,
again,
of
the
time
that
has
passed,
and
we
are
looking
here
at
not
simply
any
claim
that
could
be
found
in
the
cellar
of
a
courthouse.
this
is
the
claim
of
the
state
of
colorado
against
the
state
of
kansas,
or,
i'm
sorry,
the
state
of
kansas
against
the
state
of
colorado,
and
it
is
colorado,
along
with
kansas,
who
are
the
signatory
parties
to
this
compact,
and
the
compact
itself,
in
article
7(a),
equates
the
state
with
its
water
users.
if
i
could
turn
your
attention
to
that
particular
provision.
it
is
in
the
topside
brief,
the
blue
brief,
in
the
appendix
at
page
a-11.
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
a-10,
article
7(a)
of
the
arkansas
river
compact
says,
each
state
shall
be
subject
to
the
terms
of
this
compact.
where
the
name
of
the
state
or
the
term,
state,
is
used
in
this
compact,
these
shall
be
construed
to
include
any
person
or
entity
of
any
nature
whatsoever
using,
claiming,
or
in
any
manner
asserting
any
right
to
the
use
of
the
waters
of
the
arkansas
river
under
the
authority
of
that
state.
we
believe
that
this
equates
the
water
users
in
both
states
with
the
states
themselves
both
in
terms
of
the
actions
in
colorado
by
colorado
water
users
constituting
the
actual
violation
by
the
state
of
colorado
and,
on
the
other
side
of
the
state
line,
the
losses
suffered
by
the
individual
farmers
in
kansas,
being
the
losses
that
the
state
of
kansas,
as
state,
is
entitled
to
claim
for
breach
of
the
obligation
that
colorado
had
to
the
state
of
kansas.
in
further
support
of
that
point,
i
would
point
to
a
second
provision
of
the
compact.
it's
in
the
same
appendix
at
page
a-5,
and
this
is
in
the
famous
provision...
at
least
famous
to
those
of
us
who
have
been
working
on
this
case...
4(d).
this
is
the
provision
that
makes
explicit
the
obligation
of
colorado,
and
it's
the
proviso
in
the
last
five
lines
of
article
4(d)
that
is
important.
it
reads,
provided
that
the
waters
of
the
arkansas
river,
as
defined
in
article
3,
shall
not
be
materially
depleted
in
usable
quantity
or
availability
for
use
to
the
water
users
in
colorado
and
kansas
under
this
compact
by
future
development
or
construction.
we
believe
that
it
is
not
the
proper
characterization
of
this
case
that
it
is
going
to
be...
that
is
a
problem
for
the
individuals,
either
as
taxpayers
in
colorado
or
the
water
users
in
kansas,
but
that
these
are
state
obligations,
and
they
need
to
be
settled
between
states
on
fair,
compensatory
rules
that
are
normally
applied
in
contract
situations,
because,
as
we
know,
compacts
are
contracts
between
the
compacting
states.
mr.
john
b.
draper
your
honor,
there
is
no
specific
evidence
in
the
record
on
that,
but
from
my
knowledge
the
water
tends
to
be
transferred
with
the
land,
and
it
is
used
primarily
for
irrigation
purposes.
mr.
john
b.
draper
that's
correct,
your
honor.
however,
that
information
was
not
available
to
a
sufficient
extent
for
the
years
1950
and
later
to--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--our
experts
sought
to
determine
from
specific
data
applicable
to
each
year
what
the
losses
were,
what
the
crop
prices
were,
what
the
appropriate
interest
rates
were
for
that
year
and
each
following
year,
to
get
a--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--it
is
a
daunting
task
at
times,
your
honor,
but
we
wanted
to
present
to
the
special
master
the
most
specific
data
that
we
could
possibly
find.
mr.
john
b.
draper
appropriated
system,
your
honor.
mr.
john
b.
draper
yes.
mr.
john
b.
draper
that's
correct.
it
was...
suit
was
filed
at
the
end
of
1985.
mr.
john
b.
draper
i
believe
there
is
some
tension,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
the
way
that
the
special
master
has
applied
the
lack
of
knowledge
in
the
two
areas,
one
area
being
where
there
was
unreasonable
delay,
and
the
other
area
being
whether
prejudgment
interest
should
be
awarded,
is
inconsistent.
we
suggest
that
it
is
impossible
to
find
unreasonable
delay
if
the
plaintiff
was
unaware
of
the
claim.
that
was
essentially--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--that
would
go
into
the
reasonableness
of
the
delay.
should...
knew
or
should
have
known
would
be
the
complete
statement
of
that
test.
mr.
john
b.
draper
well,
the
cardinal
rule,
your
honor,
is
complete
compensation.
mr.
john
b.
draper
i
would
suggest
only,
your
honor,
that
there
are
methods
by
which
the
court
has
dealt
with
significant
or
unreasonable
delay
in
its
interstate
cases--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--well,
i
should
clarify
my
position.
i
would
say
that
there...
while
there
is
discretion,
it
is
a
very
limited
scope,
given
the
authorities
of
this
court,
and
that
it
is
to
be
exercised
according
to
a
system
of
principles
that
have
been
set
out
by
this
court.
mr.
john
b.
draper
yes,
your
honor.
this
court
in
1995
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
decide
that
laches
is
applicable,
but
found
that
in
this
case
there
was
unreasonable
delay
and
that,
either
through
the
doctrine
of
laches
or
acquiescence,
there
was
the
ability
of
the
court
to
deal
with
stale
claims.
mr.
john
b.
draper
we
believe
that
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
knowledge
on
the
part
of
colorado
is
absolutely
irrelevant
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
we
have
taken
no
position
on
what
the
right
date
might
be
if--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--your
honor,
that
whole
line
of
reasoning,
we
assert,
has
been
discredited.
it
is
not
logical.
it
has
faced
trenchant
criticism,
to
use
the
words
of
this
court,
in
the
1995
case,
city
of
milwaukee,
and
we
believe
that
this
is,
as
the
court
has
pointed
out,
essentially
a
contract
dispute.
one
must
keep
in
mind
that
it
is
sovereign
states
who
are
the
contracting
parties,
but
the
guiding
principles--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--because,
your
honor,
it
would
violate
the
principle
that
this
court
set
out
in
1987
that
a
remedy
would
be
provided
by
this
court
for
violation
of
an
interstate
compact.
if
you
do
that,
the
court
is
not
providing
a
complete
remedy.
mr.
john
b.
draper
there
are
two
answers
to
your
question,
your
honor--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--there
are
two
answers.
one
is
that
this
court
has
already
determined
that
there
was
not
unreasonable
delay
in
bringing
this
suit,
and
the
special
master
did
not
base
in
any
way
his
decision
to
limit
prejudgment
interest
on
any
delay
other
than
that
considered
in
the
laches
analysis.
mr.
john
b.
draper
it's
not
a
reward.
it's
simply
compensation.
there
is
no
windfall.
