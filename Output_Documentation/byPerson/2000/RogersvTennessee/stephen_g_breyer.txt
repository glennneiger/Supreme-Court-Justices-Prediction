stephen
g.
breyer
why?
suppose
that
if
you
have
two
statutes
in
a
state,
the
first
forbids
attempted
murder
and
has
lesser
penalties,
the
second
forbids
murder,
and
has
greater
penalties,
and
one
day
the
state,
the
supreme
court
decides
to...
that
anyone
who's
guilty
of
attempted
murder
is
guilty
of
murder,
because
they
say
there's
no
difference
in
the
state
of
mind,
et
cetera.
they
have
some
reasons.
now,
could
you
apply
that
retroactively?
i
wouldn't
have
thought
so.
i
mean,
it
seems
very
unfair.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
i
agree
with
you.
but
if
that's
so,
how
does
this
differ?
i
mean,
before
they
make
the
change
people
think,
if
i
go
after
somebody
and
he
survives
for
a
year
and
a
day,
it's
like
attempted
murder.
after
the
change,
it's
like
murder.
so
if...
if,
as
i
agree
with
you
completely,
the
first
would
be
fundamentally
unfair,
why
isn't
the
second?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
nor
did
my
example
of
attempted
murder,
murder.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can
imagine...
i
mean,
it's
not
totally
absurd.
it
depends
on
how
they're
written.
they
have
discretion
as
to
sentencing,
they
say,
these
notions
of
punishing
by
effects
are
out
of
date,
we
should
punish
by
state
of
mind,
the
state
of
mind
is
identical...
i
mean,
we
can
make
that
up.
it's
not
totally
absurd.
it's
just
moderately
absurd.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
it
did
happen...
if
it
did
happen,
which
is
the
point
of
it,
i
think
we'd
say
it
was
fundamentally
unfair,
and
that's
why
i
want
to
know
what
the
difference
is.
to
me
there
is...
i
can't
find
a
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
in
the
sense
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
fairness,
really
what's
happened
in
my
attempted
murder,
murder
case
is
the
difference
as
to
something
beyond
the
control
of
the
defendant,
whether
the
person
happened
to
die,
and
that
seems
just
what's
at
stake
here,
whether
we
call
it
an
element,
or
whether
we
don't
call
it
an
element,
and
that's
why
it
seems
a
relevant
hypothetical.
