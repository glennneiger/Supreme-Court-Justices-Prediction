justice
david
h.
souter
i
guess
one
of
the
questions
i
have
is
whether
we
gain
anything
by
characterizing
it
as
an
element.
if
you
go
back
to
bouie,
bouie
was
concerned
with,
let's
say,
the
elements
that
refer
to
the
conduct
of
the
defendant,
didn't
it?
and
bouie
was
concerned
about
fair
notice
to
an
individual
about
what
he
could
and
could
not
do
at
the
time
he
acts.
and
so
even
if
we
say,
well,
the
year-and-a-day
rule
is
kind
of
like
an
element,
it's
not
the
kind
of
element,
it's
not
the
kind
of
fact
that
bouie
was
concerned
with,
was...
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i...
i
think
i
agree
with
you
there.
i
mean,
if
we
assume
that
bouie
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
ex
post
facto
clause
and
all
the
calder
analytical
framework
is
subsumed
into
due
process,
i'll
be
candid
to
say
i
think
you
win
this
case,
and
my...
i
guess
my
question
was
really
aimed
at,
or
premised
on
a
different
assumption,
and
that
is
that
bouie
really
does
not
stand
for
wholesale
incorporation,
and
what
bouie
actually
held,
the
point
as
to
which
bouie
made
a
difference,
was
a
point
about
altering
elements
that
describe
the
criminal
act
itself
as
opposed
to
conditions
that
may
or
may
not
occur
subsequent
to
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
pursue
that
just
for
a
second?
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
here,
and
you
will
be
willing
to
do
this,
i
guess,
that
the
year-and-a-day
rule
is
not
an
element,
and
assume
that
the
ex
post
facto
clause
has
not
been
totally
incorporated
and
applied
to
judicial
acts.
one
line
of
analogy
that
has
been
suggested
here
this
morning,
it's
not
a
perfect
analogy,
but
it
goes
part
of
the
way
at
least,
is
an
analogy
with
sort
of
a
statute
of
limitations.
what
is
the
rule
under
due
process
if
a
statute
of
limitations
is
modified
to
a
defendant's
disadvantage
after
the
limitation
period
has
run?
can
a
legislature
do
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the
general
rule
in
the
state
court,
sitting
with
state
due
process
clauses,
or
applying
the
federal
one
for
that
matter?
have
they
held
it
a
denial
of
due
process
in
effect
to
reopen
the
limitation
period
after
it
has
run
in
a
defendant's
favor?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
even
in
a
statute
of
limitations
case,
in
a
civil
action,
don't
we
place
a
fairly
high
value
on
the
assurance
that
a
defendant
has
that
his
period
of
jeopardy,
his
period
of
exposure
to
liability
is
over,
and
he
can
simply
get
on
with
whatever
he
wants
to
do,
and
i
would
suppose
that
that
same
value
applies
with
a
greater
intensity,
or
at
least
as
great
an
intensity
in
the
area
of
the
criminal
law,
and
i...
the
analysis
so
far
doesn't
seem
to
be
giving
any
weight
to
that
interest,
and
i'd
like
to
know
why
you
think
that
interest
is
not
sufficient
to
support
the
petitioner's
argument
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
functions...
it
certainly
functions
that
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
were
essentially
evidentiary.
i
mean,
you
just
couldn't
prove
the
causation
reliably
after
that
period.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
the
answer
to
the
institutional
argument
that
you've
been
making
the
answer
that
justice
scalia
has
raised
a
couple
of
times
elsewhere
in
the
argument,
that
at
the
time
the
ex
post
facto
rule
was
written
the
way
it
was,
common
law
courts,
or
our
very
conception
of
courts,
even
in
the
federal
system,
which
was
in
gestation
at
that
time,
involved
a
system
of
much
stricter
precedent
than
we
have
today,
so
the
likelihood
of
a
court
doing
what
this
court
has
done
was
simply
much
less
than
it
is
today.
we
have
an
entirely
different
concept
of
binding
precedent
today,
and
for
that
reason,
shouldn't
the
due
process
clause
take
that
into
consideration
by
being
starchier
in...
than
perhaps
the
founders
ever
thought
there
would
be
a
need
to
be
when
reviewing
judicial
change?
