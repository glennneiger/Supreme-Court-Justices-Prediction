very
well.
very
well,
mr.
rogers.
mr.
moore,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief

h.
rehnquist
my
recollection
of
the
case
justice
scalia
refers
to,
which
i
think
is
carmel,
is
not
the
same
as
his.
i
think
we
were
both
in
dissent
in
the
case,
but
my
recollection
is
that
the
court
held
that
the
particular...
the
hue
and
cry
violated
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
i
don't
know
that
it
said
that
that
was
an
element
of
the
crime.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
moore.

ward,
