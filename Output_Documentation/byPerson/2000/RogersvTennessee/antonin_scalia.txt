justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
guess
we
wouldn't
allow
a
court,
any
more
than
we
would
allow
a
legislature,
to
change
the
law
so
that
attempted
murder
now
becomes
murder.
that
is,
so
long
as
you
intend
to
kill,
dispense
with
the
requirement
that
the
victim
actually
die.
you
could
say,
gee,
his
expectations
weren't
disappointed.
he
intended
to
kill.
it
just
so
happened
the
person
didn't
die.
and
we
certainly
wouldn't
uphold
a
state
supreme
court
judgment
that,
well,
you
know,
that's
a
technicality,
we're
not
going
to
insist
that
the
victim
have
died,
we're
going
to
get
you
for
murder
anyway.
i
guess
you
could
likewise
say
no
disappointment
of
expectations.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
why
this
is
terribly
different
from
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
guess
if
you
don't
use
an
elements
test
for
bouie,
i
guess
you
have
to
reach
the
conclusion...
and
you
say
it's
only
those
things
that
affect
the
conduct
at
the
time
of
the
offense,
regardless
of
whether
it's
an
element
or
not.
then
you
would
have
to
say
that
you
could
change
the
law
and
not
require
for
murder
in
the
first
degree
that
the
victim
had
died.
that's
a
subsequent
event.
you
knew
you
shouldn't
stab
him
with
a
knife,
intending
to
kill
him,
and
the
fact
that
he
died
should
make
no
difference.
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
can't
imagine
that
you're
allowed
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
it
isn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
what
you
should
have
said
in
response
to
the
bouie
argument
just
raised.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
in
that
day
of
rigorous
stare
decisis,
what
they
may
have
meant
by
a
judicial
act
was
a
court
announcing
that
this
rule
of
a
year
and
a
day
was
never
part
of
tennessee
law,
that
our
past
opinions
were
erroneous.
at
most
they
meant
that,
and
maybe
they
meant
simply
affirming
an
ambiguous
rule.
i
mean,
i
think
you
have
to
read
calder
in
the
time
frame
in
which
it
was
pronounced.
you
didn't
have
courts
who
suddenly
just
jumped
up
and
said
oh
yes,
that
used
to
be
the
criminal
law,
but
we
are
changing
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
really
didn't
evolve
very
much
at
the
time
of
calder
v.
bull.
i
mean,
the
courts...
or
to
the
extent
it
evolved
it,
it
evolved
the
good
old-fashioned
way.
they
lied
about
earlier
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
certainly
didn't
just
stand
up
and
say,
you
know,
we're
changing
the
law.
that
was
very
rare.
justice
antonin
scalia
ah,
we're
back
to
the
elements
again.
you
ultimately
were
driven
to
the
same
response
to
my
hypothetical,
which
was
essentially
the
same
as
justice
breyer's.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
ultimate
characterization
a
matter
for
the
state,
or
a
matter
for
the
federal
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
could
a
state
call...
suppose
you
have
the
state
in
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
saying,
well,
the
actual
death
of
the
victim
was
not
an
element
of
the
crime.
it
was
just...
you
know,
it
wasn't
really
an
element
of
murder.
now,
we'd
look
at
that
and
we'd
say,
well,
you
say
that,
but
come
on,
that's
an
element.
isn't
it
a
question
for
the
federal
court,
rather
than
the
state,
ultimately?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--how
do
you
distinguish
the
year-and-a-day
rule
from
what
we
held
to
be
an
element
a
couple
of
terms
ago?
i
think
it
was
a
couple
of
terms
ago.
that
is,
in
a
rape
prosecution,
the
requirement
that
there
be
a
hue
and
cry
by
the
victim.
we
held
that
was
an
element
of
the
crime.
like
the
year-and-a-day
rule,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
intent
of
the
criminal.
it's
after
the
event.
it's
after
the
fact.
we
held
it
was
an
element.
why
is
that
an
element
and
this
not
an
element?
