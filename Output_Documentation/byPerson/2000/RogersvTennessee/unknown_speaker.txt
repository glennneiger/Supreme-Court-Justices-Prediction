unknown
speaker
has
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
ever
applied
the
year-and-a-day
rule
to
a
case?
unknown
speaker
i...
that
wasn't
my
question,
because
i
think
your
opponent
says
it
was
dicta.
do
you
say
it
was
not
dicta,
that
it
actually
let
somebody
off
on
that
basis?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
was
it
reversed
because
the
case
shouldn't
have
been
brought,
or
because
the
testimony
was
not
relevant?
unknown
speaker
yes--
unknown
speaker
--well,
but
they
didn't
then
analyze
separately
the
year-and-the-day
rule,
or...
you...
i
thought
you'd
said
that
a
witness
testified,
and
the
witness
said
something
happened
in
july
but
she
didn't
say
when.
unknown
speaker
and
i'm
curious
whether
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
in
invoking
the
year-and-a-day
rule
said
it
made
the
witness'
testimony
irrelevant,
or
did
it...
does
the
year-and-a-day
rule
mean
that
the
entire
prosecution
shouldn't
have
been
brought?
unknown
speaker
the
whole
opinion
was
one--
unknown
speaker
--absentia.
unknown
speaker
so
it
can
give...
the
tennessee
courts
can
give
an
advisory
opinion
in
that
respect?
i
mean,
they
can--
unknown
speaker
--well,
but
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical,
and
the
point
interests
me
as
well,
it's
actually
to
assume
the
opposite,
that
a
court
is
in
a
system
where
it
is
improper
to
give
an
advisory
opinion.
then
what
would
happen?
the
court's
hands
are
tied.
unknown
speaker
but
it
could
never
change
it,
unless
you're
saying
that
the
dictum
would
provide
sufficient
basis
for
a
subsequent
case.
unknown
speaker
then
we
have
an
incremental
overruling
process
that
you
would
allow?
they're
still
changing
the
law.
unknown
speaker
well--
--well--
--a
moment
ago
you
were
saying
how
you
had
to
have
certainty
in
advising
your
client,
but
if
that
is
permissible
in
a
gradual
overruling,
surely
the
certainty
is
gone.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
know
what
the
tennessee
supreme
court
is
going
to
do
the
next
time
it
comes
up
if
in
the
interim
it
has
criticized
the
rule.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
10
state
supreme
courts
in
other
jurisdictions...
that
didn't
happen
here...
had
criticized
the
rule
and
tennessee
was
just
quiet
about
it.
you've
got
the
same
problem.
unknown
speaker
plus...
plus
we
know
that
the
day,
year-and-a-day
rule
is
an
outmoded
relic
anyway.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ward,
you
seem
to
accept
it
as
unthinkable
that
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
should
be
unable
to
alter
a
rule
of
criminal
law
by
judicial
decision.
do
you
think
it
was
unthinkable
at
the
time
the
federal
constitution
was
adopted?
do
you
think
that
common
law
courts,
which
had
much
more
rigorous
notions
of
stare
decisis
than
we
do
today,
do
you
think
they
would
have
thought
it
unthinkable
that
a
court
should
not
be
able
to
suddenly
make
a
crime
of
what
had
not
been
a
crime
at
common
law?
i
mean,
i
don't
know
why
you
accept
that,
especially
when
you're
dealing
with
a
state
that
has
a
constitutional
provision
adopted
in
1870
which
reads,
all
laws
and
ordinances
now
in
force
and
use
in
this
state
not
inconsistent
with
this
constitution
shall
continue
in
force
and
use
until
they
shall
expire,
be
altered,
or
repealed
by
the
legislature.
i
don't
think
it's
unthinkable
at
all,
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
shouldn't
be
able
to
alter
the
criminal
law.
i
mean,
if
you
want
to
accept
it,
fine,
but
i
don't
know--
unknown
speaker
--why
you
would
accept
it.
unknown
speaker
the
question
to
you,
assume
that
it
was
unthinkable
that
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
shouldn't
be
able
to
change
the
criminal
law,
why
it
should
be
able
to
do
that,
but
that's
certainly
not
what
is
envisioned
by
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
tennessee.
unknown
speaker
we
can't
change
it
in
this
case
because
it
would
be
ex
post
facto.
one
answer
that
you
could
give
is
yes,
that's
right,
only
the
legislature
can
change
it,
but
you're
not
giving
that
answer.
unknown
speaker
no.
how
do
you
explain
the
provision
of
the
tennessee
constitution
that
i
quoted?
unknown
speaker
there
are
highest
courts
who
concede
from
time
to
time
that
they
are
fallible,
that
they
may
have
made
a
mistake.
unknown
speaker
i
could
understand
very
clearly,
mr.
ward,
the
argument
if
you
were
saying
that
they
added
an
element,
or
they
subtracted
an
element
from
the
offense,
or
something
like
that.
you
used
to
have
to
do
it
intentionally,
but
you
don't
have
to
anymore,
and
it's
a
much
different...
but
here
you
have
something
that
really
is
quite
peripheral,
out
on
the
fringes,
that
doesn't
govern
the
substantive
criminal
law
at
all.
it's
almost
like
a
statute
of
limitations.
unknown
speaker
but
that
would
be
true
of
a
statute
of
limitations
too,
would
it
not?
if
the
statute
of
limitations
from...
say,
supposing
tennessee
had
a
statute
of
limitations
for
robbery,
10
years.
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
would
say
you
have
to
bring
an
action
within
10
years
in
order
to
convict
of
robbery,
but
that
doesn't
really
make
it
an
element
of
the
substantive
criminal
law.
unknown
speaker
with
a
statute
of
limitations
your
argument
would
go,
you
are
guilty
of
the
crime
but
can't
be
prosecuted
for
it
after
the
10
years,
whereas
with
a
year
and
a
day,
your
position
is
you're
not
guilty
of
the
crime
unless
the
death
occurs
within
a
year
of...
within
a
year
and
a
day.
now,
your
opponent
says
it's
just
evidentiary.
what's
your
response
to
that?
it's
just
a
question
of
evidence.
unknown
speaker
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
authority,
mr.
ward,
for
simply
suggesting
that
all
of
the
calder
categories
are
carried
over
into
this
ex...
like
ex
post
facto...
clearly
this
is
not
governed
by
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
it's
governed
by
bouie,
which
said
some
of
the
same
considerations
applied.
you're
talking
as
if
everything
is
carried
over
bag
and
baggage.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
then
you're
acting
for...
asking
for
an
extension
of
bouie,
which
clearly
didn't
cover
these
others.
unknown
speaker
but
statutes
often...
i'm
sorry,
chief.
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
so
your
position
is,
in
the
hypothetical
that
i
raised
with
your
colleague
over
there,
your
position
is
that
if
the
legislature
changed,
or
our
court
changed
the
law
so
that
the
victim
no
longer
has
to
die,
you're
guilty
of
murder,
your
reliance
would
have
been
just
the
same.
you
intended
to
kill
the
person.
you
struck
him
with
a
knife.
he
just
happened,
through
your
good
luck,
not
to
die.
no
reliance
interest
at
all.
do
you
really
think
the
court
could
say,
we
no
longer
require
the
victim
die
for
murder?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
i
think
it's
because
it's
an
element
of
the
crime,
but
why
do
you
think
it
is?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
ah,
so
we
do
come
down
to
the
debate
over
whether
this
timing
thing
here
is
an
element
of
the
crime
or
not.
you've
just
said
that
it's
irrelevant
for
due
process
purposes.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
change
the
hypothetical
so
it
isn't
a
statute,
it's
a
common
law
crime.
it
doesn't
matter.
i
mean,
the
fact
is,
you
have
to
come
back...
in
order
to
avoid
my
hypothetical
you
have
to
fall
back
on
the
fact
that
this
is
not
an
element
of
the
crime
in
this
case.
if
it's
an
element
of
the
crime,
i
think
you're
going
to
lose,
unless
you're
willing
to
accept
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you
that
you
can
change
the
law
through
judicial
decision
to
dispense
with
the
death
of
the
victim.
unknown
speaker
that's
right,
so
there
must
be
something
beyond
bouie's
fair
warning
principle.
unknown
speaker
you're
careful
to
say
that
this
is
not
a
substantive
due
process
violation,
and
that's
the
way
the
question
presented
is.
i...
the
ex
post
facto
law
applies
to
the
states.
can
we
consider
this
as
an
ex
post
facto
case
without
any
prejudice
to
your
position?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no.
can
we
debate
this
case
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
or
does
that
depart
from--
unknown
speaker
--suppose
the
court
thinks
that
it's
an
ex
post
facto
violation
for
the
legislature
to
repeal
the...
pardon
me,
for
the
court
to
abrogate
the
year-and-a-day
rule.
that's
really
what's
before
us,
isn't
it?
isn't
this
an
ex
post
facto
case
rather
than
a
substantive
due
process
case?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
and
this
is
the
way
you
read
bouie.
of
course,
bouie
does
have
language
to
the
effect
that
if
the
legislature
can't
do
it
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
neither
can
the
courts,
and
i
would
assume
that
the
court
in
bouie
would
have
said,
because
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause
itself,
as
well
as
because
of
the
substantive
due
process
clause,
or
was
it
restrained
from
doing
that
just
because
we've
always
said
that
ex
post
facto
is
for
legislatures,
not
courts?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
if
we
prevail
for
your
position
we
do
have
to
cut
back
on
some
of
the
language
in
bouie,
do
we
not?
unknown
speaker
because
there
is
the
fact,
if
we
say
well,
the
legislature
can't
do
it
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
neither
can
the
courts.
unknown
speaker
i
think
that's
a
fair
argument,
but
we
have
to
at
least
cut
back
on
the
dicta.
unknown
speaker
if
that's
what
it
is.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
interrupt
you
there
for
a
second?
the
clause
itself
doesn't
speak
about
the
legislative
branch.
it
speaks
about,
a
state
may
not
pass
such
a
law,
and
it's
true,
of
course,
that
a
court
normally
looks
to
the
past
and
decides
what
the
law
has
always
been,
even
though
a
question
has
never
been
decided.
but
here,
however,
it's
unusual,
because
the
tennessee
supreme
court
expressly
says,
we're
going
to
change
a
substantive
rule
of
law,
and
is
that
any
different
than
if
it
had
been
exercising,
say,
its
functions
to
make
court
rules,
or
had
said,
we
are
now
going
to
pass
the
following
rule,
that
in
murder
cases
the
victim
does
not
have
to
die
within
a
year.
if
they'd
written
it
out
as
a
rule
to
be
applied
in
the
future,
and
somehow
had
authority
to
do
that
and
comply
with
the
tennessee
constitution,
how
would
we
treat
that,
as
a
court
rule,
or
as
a
legislative
rule?
unknown
speaker
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
is
it
acknowledged
and
accepted
that
a
legislature
could
not
alter
an
ex...
a
statute
of
limitations,
after
it
has
run
for
a
defendant?
unknown
speaker
i--
unknown
speaker
--i
think
we've
held,
in
connection
with
a
civil
case,
that
a
legislature
can
change
the
statute
of
limitations
without
violating
the
due
process
clause.
unknown
speaker
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
and
it's
awfully
technical,
you
see.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought...
i...
well,
we'll
go
and
read
it.
i
thought
we...
we
said
that
because
it
was
an
element.
unknown
speaker
well,
can
i
give
you
a
hypothetical
that...
stick
to
the
year-and-a-day
rule,
because
that's
what
we
have
before
us.
supposing
just
before
1989
there'd
been
a
really
terrible
crime,
he
killed
a
child
in
a
bad
situation,
but
the
child
didn't
die
for
over
a
year
and
a
half,
or
over
a
year
and
a
day,
and
the
tennessee...
that
prompted
the
tennessee
legislature
to
abolish
that
rule,
and
they
said
in
the
rule,
abolish
it
for
the
past
case
too,
and
they
said
well,
they
can't
do
that,
and
they
say,
if
we
can't
do
that
because
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause
we
urge
the
supreme
court
to
abolish
it
judicially,
and
remind
them
that
they
all
run
for
reelection
if
they
don't
do
it,
so--
[laughter]
and
then,
sure
enough,
the
case
comes
up
and
they
decide,
well,
it's
a...
it
was
a
common
law
rule
but
we're
going
to
abolish
it.
now,
why
should
there
be
a
different
rule
when
it's
done
by
the
court
rather
than
by
the
legislature?
that's
my
real
question
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
the
institutional
difference
when
the
court
frankly
says,
we
are
making
a
new
rule
of
law?
what
is
the
institutional
difference?
unknown
speaker
but
my
hypothetical
assumed
that
there
was
political
pressure.
unknown
speaker
my
hypothetical
assumed
that
there
was
political
pressure
because
they
have
to
run
for
reelection.
they
can
read
the
newspapers
and
see
how
outraged
the
public
is
about
this
particular
crime.
unknown
speaker
justice
kennedy
has
an
announcement.
