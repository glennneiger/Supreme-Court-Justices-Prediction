mr.
w.
mark
ward
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
two
cases,
bouie
v.
city
of
columbia
and
marks
v.
united
states,
this
court
stated
that
ex
post
facto
principles
apply
to
judicial
decisions
under
very
narrow
circumstances,
and
that's
only
when
those
judicial
decisions
are
unexpected
and
indefensible
based
upon
the
law
that's
been
expressed
at
the
time
of
the
conduct
in
question.
this
case
involves
a
misapplication
of
this
rule
of
law
by
the
tennessee
supreme
court.
in
this
case,
the
tennessee
supreme
court
held
that
its
decision
to
overrule
itself
and
to
overrule
a
700-year-old
rule
of
law
was
not
unexpected
and
indefensible
based
upon
this
test
that
this
court
adopted.
mr.
w.
mark
ward
the
court
has
recognized
it
since
1907,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
mark
ward
it
was
not
dicta
in
that
case.
in
1907
in
percer
v.
state,
if
i
could
explain--
mr.
w.
mark
ward
--the
court
reversed
in
percer
v.
state
for
numerous
reasons.
among
those,
they
tried
the
defendant
without
the
defendant
being
present.
one
of
the
reasons
they
reversed
was
because
they
put
on
proof
during
the
trial
as
to
the
date
of
the
death
of
the
deceased,
the
witness
said
that
it
happened
sometime
in
july,
but
never
testified
as
to
what
date,
what
day
of
the
month
in
july,
or
what
year
in
july.
the
court
in...
the
tennessee
supreme
court
referenced
the
year-and-a-day
rule
and
reversed
the
case,
because
absent
some
evidence
of
what
date
and
year
there
was
a
death,
then
there
could
be
insufficient
evidence.
mr.
w.
mark
ward
the
court...
the
tennessee
supreme
court
in
1907
listed
numerous
reasons
and
said
for
all
of
these
we
reverse.
it's
not
like
they
said--
mr.
w.
mark
ward
--specifically,
this
is
the
one
we're
going
to
reverse
on.
mr.
w.
mark
ward
that's
correct.
mr.
w.
mark
ward
well,
what
the
court
stated
was
that
absent
the...
they...
it
was
really
a
very...
one-paragraph
opinion,
a
very
short
opinion.
they--
mr.
w.
mark
ward
--no.
most
of
the
paragraph
was...
the
opinion
was
taken
up
with
the
discussion
of
trying
the
man
in
abstentia.
mr.
w.
mark
ward
then
there
was
about
a
half-a-page
paragraph
that
dealt
with
two
issues.
one
was,
was
this
indictment
returned
before
the
date
of
the
offense
or
not?
the
other
one
was
the
year-and-a-day
rule,
and
absent
this
testimony
there
was
insufficient
proof
before
the
court
as
to
either
fact,
the
year-and-a-day
rule
or
when
the
offense
was
occurred,
so
i
contend
it
was
not
dicta
in
that
case.
and
in
this
case,
your
honor,
state
v.
rogers,
the
court,
the
tennessee
supreme
court
said,
we
have
recognized
the
year-and-a-day
rule
in
tennessee
since
1907.
mr.
w.
mark
ward
well--
mr.
w.
mark
ward
--well,
with
regard
to
fair
warning
my
client
was
entitled
objectively.
subjectively,
i
have
to
admit
it
is
very
difficult
to
ever
prove
that
any
criminal
defendant
relies
upon
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
that
he
or
she
commits
an
act,
but
objectively
he
was
entitled
to
rely
upon
the
year-and-a-day
rule
if
the
victim
did
survive.
but
more
importantly
than
that,
after
the
fact,
after
he
was
charged,
fair
notice
and
reliance
applies
after
the
fact
also,
not
just
at
the
time
of
the
act;
otherwise,
a
defendant
who
is
approaching
trial
is
never
going
to
know
exactly
what
are
the
elements
of
the
offense,
or
what
is
the
punishment
that
i'm
about
to
face.
we
don't
just
say
you're
entitled
to
fair
warning
of
the
punishment
at
the
time
you
commit
it,
but
you're
also,
based
upon
that
time,
are
allowed
to
rely
upon
that
as
you're
approaching
trial.
mr.
w.
mark
ward
well--
mr.
w.
mark
ward
--well,
it's
not.
under
the
state's
theory
in
this
case,
as
long
as
the
defendant
had
the
same
mens
rea,
same
actus
reis,
the
fact
that
the
result
occurred
or
didn't
occur
would
be
irrelevant,
and
under
the
state's
theory
you
could
eliminate
the
requirement
that
there
be
a
result
and
there
would
be
no
problem
with
that.
but
the
problem
is
that
as
a
matter
of
fundamental
fairness
and
fair
warning
as
to
punishment
deals
with
not
just
at
the
time
of
the
act.
if
we
allow
courts
to
retroactively
alter
the
elements
of
an
offense
or
to
retroactively
enhance
punishment,
what
i
have
to
do,
what
i
have
to
tell
my
clients
when
we're
getting
ready
to
go
to
trial
is,
i
can
tell
you
what
the
law
was
at
the
time
you
committed
your
crime,
and
i
can
tell
you
what
the
law
is
today,
as
we
get
ready
to
go
for
trial,
and
you're
innocent
of
the
law
as
we
have
it
today.
in
some
cases
i'm
going
to
get
to
tell
them
that.
but
i
can't
tell
you,
because
the
courts
can
change
after
the
fact.
they
can
eliminate
this
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
w.
mark
ward
i
wouldn't
be
here,
and
that
would
be
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation.
mr.
w.
mark
ward
no,
your
honor.
the
tennessee
court
could
have
abolished
this
rule
and
applied
it
prospectively,
and
probably,
and
we
contend
was
required
to
do
that
if
it
wanted
to
abolish
the
rule
because
of
the
ex
post
facto
due
process
requirements.
mr.
w.
mark
ward
tennessee
courts,
i
have
no
citations,
but
they
frequently
make
rulings
prospectively.
mr.
w.
mark
ward
well,
i
think
that
the
court
could
give
some
indication,
and
could
voice
some
discomfort
with
the
rule
short
of
an
advisory
opinion.
mr.
w.
mark
ward
it
would--
mr.
w.
mark
ward
--i
think
the
dictum
in
the
case
would
then
be
such
that
when
a
court
came
along
later
it
would
be
able
to
say,
this
was
expected
and
defensible
because
we
criticized
the
rule
in
a
previous
case.
mr.
w.
mark
ward
well--
mr.
w.
mark
ward
--but
i
would
be
fairly
confident,
if
the
tennessee
supreme
court
had
criticized
the
rule
in
advising
my
client
that
there
was
a
substantial
likelihood
that
the
rule
would
be
changed.
mr.
w.
mark
ward
well--
mr.
w.
mark
ward
--well,
with
regard
to
other
states
i
think
it's
asking
too
much
of
our
citizens
to
ignore
a
rule
of
the
tennessee
supreme
court
and
look
to
other
states.
mr.
w.
mark
ward
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
w.
mark
ward
--that
the
tennessee
supreme
court
can
alter
the...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand...
let...
well,
maybe
i
should
continue.
mr.
w.
mark
ward
well,
the
tennessee
supreme
court
can
change
the
rule,
and
i
have
no
problem
with
the
court
changing
the
rule.
the
problem
that
i'm
talking
about
is
the
retroactive--
mr.
w.
mark
ward
--no,
i'm--
mr.
w.
mark
ward
--that
provision,
my
interpretation
of
that
provision
is
it
refers
to
statutory
laws
and
not
to
judicial
decisions
of
the
courts,
would
be
my
interpretation
of
that.
mr.
w.
mark
ward
well,
the
tennessee
supreme
court
has
already
said
that
the
legislature
did
not
make
a
change
in
it,
and
the
year-and-a-day
rule
is--
mr.
w.
mark
ward
--so
if
this
court
was
to
reverse,
the
tennessee
supreme
court
then
would
change
its
opinion?
mr.
w.
mark
ward
i
guess
the
tennessee
supreme
court
could
do
it.
they
could
certainly
try
it,
and
i
would
certainly
try
to
think
of
some
way
to
come
back
to
this
court,
but--
mr.
w.
mark
ward
--i
guess
i
have
to
concede
that
that's
always
possible,
but
the
court
has
made
a
detailed
analysis,
the
tennessee
supreme
court,
they've
rejected
that,
and
i
believe
that
i
would
stand
behind
them
that
they
would
not
change
their
mind
in
midstream
simply
because
this
court
sent
the
case
back
and
said
they
erred
on
another
point.
but
i'm
not
contending
the
tennessee
supreme
court
can't
change
the
rule.
the
rule
is
dead
in
tennessee.
the
year-and-a-day
rule
has
been
done
away
with.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
they
can
apply
it
to
an
offense
that
was
committed
5
years
prior
to
that,
and
it
gets
back
to
the
basic
principle
of
legality.
do
we
try
defendants
based
upon
the
law
that's
in
existence
at
the
time
of
their
conduct,
or
do
we
change
it
after
the
fact,
and
the
problem
with
changing
it
after
the
fact
is,
what
it's
going
to
do
is,
it's
going
to
undermine
the
presumption
of
innocence.
mr.
w.
mark
ward
well,
i
disagree,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
this
is
a
material
element
of
the
offense
as
the
tennessee
supreme
court
has
interpreted
it.
they
have
said
that
you
must
prove
death
within
a
year
and
a
day
in
order
to
convict
of
any
homicide
offense
in
tennessee,
and--
mr.
w.
mark
ward
--no,
because
it
doesn't
deal
with
anything
with
regard
to
the...
it
doesn't
deal
with
anything
but
a
time
period
that
they're
required
to
bring
an
action
in.
this
is
a
time
period
that
they
must
prove
certain
facts
occurred
in.
mr.
w.
mark
ward
well,
it's...
as
interpreted
by
the
tennessee
supreme
court,
it's
not
just
a
question
of
evidence.
it's
a
material
element
that's
required
to
be
proven
by
the
prosecution,
and
there
is
nothing
else...
if
it
was
a
rule
of
admissibility
of
evidence,
there
would
be
something
else
that
could
prove
this
point,
or
prove
the
conviction
of...
prove
the
elements
of
the
crime,
but
this
is
an
element
that,
it
must
be
proven.
there's
nothing
else
available.
if
you
don't
prove
this
element,
you
don't
prove
your
case.
it's
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
rule.
if
you
don't
prove
this...
and
this
is...
you
lose.
and
now
we
say
after
the
fact
i
can't
prove
it,
we'll
just
eliminate
it.
any
element
of
the
offense
i
can't
prove,
we
have
the
power
to
retroactively
eliminate.
mr.
w.
mark
ward
it's
not
a
fact
that
would
deal
with
the
first
calder
category,
whether
something
was
criminal,
made
criminal
after
the
fact,
no
more
than
whether
or
not--
mr.
w.
mark
ward
--i
agree
with
your
honor.
the
cases
that
come
before
this
court
for
the
most
part
have
dealt
with
the
first
calder
category.
mr.
w.
mark
ward
but
if
this
court--
mr.
w.
mark
ward
--i
believe--
mr.
w.
mark
ward
--well,
that's
not
my
argument.
mr.
w.
mark
ward
that's
my
opponent's.
mr.
w.
mark
ward
but
if
this
court
applies
one
calder
category
there's
no
reason
not
to
apply
them
all.
if
there's
some
concern
about
whether
due
process
principles
should
incorporate...
ex
post
facto
principles
should
apply--
mr.
w.
mark
ward
--well,
i
submit
it's
carried
over
with
the
bouie
limitation
that
the
judicial
decision
has
to
be
unexpected
and
indefensible,
but
what
i'm
suggesting
is,
there's
no
reason
to
distinguish
the
first
calder
category
from
any
of
the
others
as
far
as
ranking
them
in
some
priority
that--
mr.
w.
mark
ward
--yes.
i'm
asking...
in
one
sense
i'm
asking
for
an
extension.
in
the
other
sense
i'm
asking
the
court
to
say
that
it
meant
what
it
said,
that
ex
post
facto
principles
apply
through
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
w.
mark
ward
that's
correct,
and
actually
when
you
look
at
the
definition
in
bouie
that
was
cited
from
calder
v.
bull,
the
discussion
talks
about
aggravating
a
crime
after
the
fact,
and
also
making
something
criminal
that
wasn't
a
crime
after
the
fact,
and
those
are
the
two
things
that
bowie
concentrated
on
in
its
statement
or
definition
of
an
ex
post
facto
law,
the
first
two
calder
categories.
and
then
the
court
said,
if
it's
ex
post
facto
for
a
legislature
to
do
it,
then
due
process
should
prevent
the
courts
from
obtaining
the
same
result.
my
suggestion
is
that
there's
just
as
great
a
harm
from
making
something
criminal
that
wasn't
criminal
before
as
it
is
to
aggravate
a
criminal
offense.
for
instance,
if
you
take
something
that's
not
a
crime
and
give
it
a
2-day
punishment.
it's
a
far
greater
harm
to
take
something
that
already
is
a
crime
with
a
2-day
punishment
and
then
aggravate
it
to
where
it
has
a
20-year
punishment.
justice
chase
talked
in
calder
about
those
calder
categories
and
said
they
came
from
the
same
kinds
of
harm,
and
my
suggestion
is
that
ex
post
facto
principles
are
fundamental
concepts,
fundamental
concepts
like
fundamental
fairness.
it's
fundamentally
unfair
to
alter
the
elements
of
an
offense
after
the
fact,
or
to
aggravate
it.
it's
fundamentally
unfair
because
it
undermines
the
presumption
of
innocence.
mr.
w.
mark
ward
that's
the
rule
i'm
asking,
but
only
under
the
limited
circumstance
when
the
ruling
is
unexpected
and
indefensible
under
the
test
this
court
adopted
in
bouie
and
marks.
this
test
was
developed
from
jerome
hall's
principles
of
criminal
law,
and
it's
to
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
all
opinions
in
one
way
or
the
other
are
retroactive.
how
do
we
treat
these
opinions
that
are
grossly
retroactive,
that
change
a
clear
line
of
authority
in
a
jurisdiction?
if
there's
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
w.
mark
ward
unless
the
court
has
other
questions,
i
have
nothing
else.
