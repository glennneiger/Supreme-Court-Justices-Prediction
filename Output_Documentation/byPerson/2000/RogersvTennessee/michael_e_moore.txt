mr.
michael
e.
moore
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
decision
below
did
not
deny
petitioner
due
process
of
law
because
it
did
not
deprive
him
of
fair
warning
that
stabbing
another
person
in
the
chest
with
a
butcher
knife
risked
prosecution
under
tennessee's
homicide
statutes.
the
statute
under
which
petitioner
was
convicted
defines
the
crime
of
second
degree
murder
as
the
knowing
killing
of
another.
the...
a
conviction
under
that
statute
does
not
require
that
the
victim
die
within
any
particular
period
of
time,
it
does
not
require
that
the
defendant
know
that
the
victim
will
die
within
any
particular
time.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
yes,
your
honor,
our
position
below
was
that
the
rule
was
a
substantive
principle
of
law
that
had
been
abolished
by
operation
of
our
criminal
code
of
'89,
which
said
that
unless
conduct
is
described
as
an
offense
by
statute
it
is
no
longer
an
offense,
and
we
argued
that
the
evident
purpose
of
that
provision
was
to
abolish
all
common
law
crimes,
common
law
elements
of
crimes--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--but
that
position
was
rejected,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
our
position
is
that
for
due
process
purposes
the
label
one
attaches
to
the
rule,
whether
one
calls
it
a
substantive
rule,
a
procedural
rule,
an
evidentiary
rule,
an
elemental
rule,
whatever
label
one
attaches
to
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference,
because
the
touchstone
of
due
process
fair
warning
in
this
context,
in
the
retroactivity
context,
is
the
violation
of
a
reliance
interest
of
some
sort,
and
because--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--your
honor's
hypothetical
is
if
we
had
prevailed
and
the
'89
act
had--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
what
your
honor's
question
essentially
is,
if
the
legislature
had
effectuated
this
change,
would
this
be
a
prohibited
ex
post
facto
law.
our
contention
is
that
no,
it
would
not
have
been,
although
i
must
concede
that
if
the
rule
had
been
a
definitional
element
of
the
crime,
that
would
have
been
an
ex
post
facto
violation.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
right,
and
i
think
labels
do
make
a
difference
for
ex
post
facto
clause
purposes,
if
in--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--but
not
for
due
process
purposes.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
i
do
not.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
but
i
think--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--well,
i...
certainly
the
death
of
the
victim
is
an
element
of
the
crime.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
the
timing
of
the
death
of
the
victim
is
not
an
element
of
the
crime.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
i
think
the
due
process
violation
in
your
honor's
hypothetical
would
be
that...
well,
i
think
first
of
all,
your
honor's
hypothetical
assumes
that
a
court
may
rewrite
a
statute.
homicide
in
tennessee
is
not
a
common
law
crime.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
it's
a
statutory
crime.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
i
think
the
change,
the
alteration
in
the
law
posited
by
your
honor's
hypothetical
would
be
unconstitutional,
but
not
because
it
violated
bouie's
fair
warning
principle.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
well,
there
is
substantive
due
process.
if
it
is
a
wholly
irrational
change,
that
indeed
would
be
unconstitutional
for
that
reason,
but
i
think
the
retroactivity
problem
here
that
is
the
subject
of
mr.
ward's
client's
complaint
is
that
somehow
the
retroactive
alteration
of
this
principle
of
law
deprived
him
of
some
form
of
fair
warning.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
the
court
may
consider
this
to
be
an
ex
post
facto
case,
because
the
ex
post
facto--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--certainly
your
honor
may
ask
me
questions
concerning
whether
the
ex
post
facto
clause
would
be
violated
if
this
alteration
had
been
effectuated
by
the
legislature,
yes.
is
that
your...
is
your
honor's
point--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--i
would
disagree
with
your
honor,
because
it
would
be
an
ex
post
facto
case
if
the
alteration
of
the
law
here
had
been
effectuated
by
the
legislature.
now,
mr.
ward's
argument
is
that
the
technical
restrictions
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause
have
been
imported
into
the
due
process
clause,
but
there
are
numerous
reasons
why
we
contend
that
would
be
imprudent
and,
as
a
matter
of
history,
incorrect.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
well,
i
think
a
combination
of
the
two,
but
i
think
bouie
cannot
be
read
to
have
already
accomplished
this
importation
that
mr.
ward
suggests
this
court
ought
to
adopt
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
well,
i
think
candidly
the
language
to
which
your
honor
refers
is
properly
characterized
as
dicta,
because
in
the
bouie
opinion
justice
brennan
quite
clearly
located
the
doctrinal
source
of
his
ruling
in
this
court's
bouie
for
vagueness
jurisprudence.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
the
state
of
tennessee
would
not
object
to
your
honors
clarifying
that
point,
and
i
think
the
point
is
well
taken
in
justice
brennan's
opinion
in
that
case,
is
that
both
the
ex
post
facto
clause
and
the
due
process
clause
of
course
spring
from
a
common
core
of
concerns
about
fairness,
but
obviously
the
purpose
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause
is
as
really
a
structural
restraint
on
the
power
of
the
legislative
branch.
now,
clearly--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--i
think,
under
this
court's
first
ex
post
facto
case,
calder
v.
bull,
the
action
would
still
be
a
judicial
act
and
therefore
beyond
the
scope
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
if
your
honor
will
recall,
in
that
case
three
of
the
four
justices
posited
the
possibility
that
the
resolution
under
review
there
had
been
adopted
by
the
connecticut
legislature
in
the
exercise
of
that
body's
historic
powers
to
operate
as
a
court,
and
all
three
of
those
justices
said
that
if
we
decide
this
is
a
judicial
act
rather
than
an
act
of
legislation,
it
is
beyond
the
words
of
the
constitution.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
i
would
still
argue,
your
honor,
that
the
tennessee
supreme
court's
decision
in
this
case
is
in
the
tradition
of
the...
of
a
common
law
court.
the
common
law
does
evolve,
and
the
first
principle
of
that
evolution
is
that
where
the
reasons
for
a
rule
fail,
the
rule
should
also
fail,
and
so
this--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--right,
but
of
course
it
is
our
contention,
your
honor,
that
calder
v.
bull
is
really
beside
the
point
here,
because
this
is
a
due
process
case,
not
an
ex
post
facto
clause
case.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
i
believe,
insofar
as
this
court's
jurisprudence
is
concerned,
that
the
question
remains
open.
i
would
argue
that--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--i
can
only
speak
to
my
jurisdiction's
case
law,
and
i
cannot
cite
to
your
honor
a
case
that
directly
addresses
that
issue
under
our
state
constitutional
equivalent
of
the
united
states
or
the
fourteenth
amendment's
due
process
clause.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
i
do
not
believe
that
is
an
accepted
proposition.
i
believe
that
if
a
legislature
did
it,
one
would
have
to
measure
that
law
against
each
of
the
four
calder
categories,
and
it's
not
really
an
easy
fit
under
any
of
those
four
categories.
a
statute
of
limitations
does
not
render
criminal
actions
innocent
when
done.
it
involves...
the
statute
of
limitations
doesn't
regulate
primary
conduct
at
all.
the
statute
of
limitations
also
involves
facts
which
are
sort
of
wholly
collateral
to
guilt
or
innocence,
so
i
think
it
doesn't
either
aggravate
the
crime,
it
doesn't...
quite
clearly
it
doesn't
increase
the
punishment,
and
because
it
involves
issues
that
are
wholly
collateral
to
guilt
or
innocence,
it's
hard
to
argue
that
it's
a
sufficiency-of-the-evidence
rule.
rather,
the
remedy
for
a
statute
of
limitations
violation
would
be
to
dismiss
the
prosecution
altogether,
to
dismiss
the
indictment
altogether,
not
to
enter
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
so
i
think
if
i
were
here
arguing
that
case,
at
least
i
would
have
an
argument
that
would
pass
the
smile
test.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
because,
your
honor,
the
year-and-a-day
rule
is
not
a
rule
of
repose.
none
of
its
purposes
at
common
law
really
were
concerned
with--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--perhaps
it
functions
that
way,
but
its
purposes
at
common
law
were
wholly
unrelated
to
considerations
of
repose,
or
concern
with...
concerns
with
repose,
so
i
don't
believe--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--precisely,
your
honor,
so
i
don't
believe
that
petitioner
can
really
claim
any
expectation
interest
in
repose
that
derives
from
the
rule.
now,
the
statute
of
limitations
does
protect
such
concerns
but,
of
course,
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
for
murder
in
tennessee--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--which
reflects
a
judgment,
i
believe,
that...
by
our
legislature
that
murderers
should
not
have
any
repose.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
well,
that...
certainly
that
case
law
certainly
would,
i
think,
support
our
position
here.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
i
don't
think
so,
but
i--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
first
of
all
the
change
here
is
a
change
in
a
rule
that
does
not
address
either
primary
conduct
or...
and
does
not
eliminate
the
mens
rea
with
respect
to
the
result
of
that--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--and
your
honor's
hypothetical
is
that...
that,
if
i
understand
it,
that
a
court
would
decide
that
attempted
murder
equals
murder.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
analytically
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
large
difference,
since
you
have
essentially
in
your
hypothetical
created
or
expanded
the
elements
of
the
crime
in
a
way
that
affected
the
primary
conduct
of
the
actor.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
i
think
the
year-and-a-day
rule,
that
it
is
not
accurate
to
characterize
the
year-and-a-day
rule
as
an
element,
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
court
below,
and
as
a
matter
of
tennessee
law,
i
think
it
is
clear
from
its
opinion
indicated
that
it
is
not
an
element
of
homicide.
it
said,
rather,
that
the
effect
of
its
elimination
was
merely
to
give
the
state
an
opportunity
to
prove
causation,
so--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--i
think--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--i
would
disagree
with
that.
i
think--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--i
think
the
state--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--well,
i
would
answer
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
it
is
quite
plainly
not
a
statutory
element,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
is
an
issue
of
state
law,
and
in
fact
the
court
here
said,
the
lower
court
here
said
that
it
has
never
been
a
part
of
the
statutory
law
of
the
state.
secondly,
it
is
not
an
element
because
it
is
not
one
of
those
issues
that
is
submitted
to
the
jury.
it's
rather
a
jurisdictional
fact.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
but
in
either
case
i
don't
think
the
problem
with
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
or
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
would
be
one
of
due
process
fair
warning,
which
is
the
principle
of
due
process--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--because
of
the
institutional
differences
between
courts
and
legislatures.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
because
of
the
insulation
of
that,
of
the
institution
of
the
courts
from
the
same
sorts
of
political
pressures
that
gave
rise
to
the
framers'
complete
distrust
of
the
ability
of
the
legislative
branch
to
legislate
in
this
particular
area.
courts
not
only
are
insulated
from
the
same
sorts
of
political
pressures,
but
they're
subject
to
a
tradition
of
institutional--
mr.
michael
e.
moore
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
e.
moore
well,
i
think
your
honor's
hypothetical
posits
there
is
political
pressure,
but
the
court,
of
course,
by
tradition
doesn't
succumb
to
political
pressure.
[laughter]
and
in
addition
it
operates
under
a
set
of
institutional
constraints
in
the
way
it
goes
about
doing
its
business
that
it
seems
to
me
provides
important
protections
here.
the...
it
can't
initiate
law
reform
efforts
of
its
own.
it
must...
it
can
only
act
in
the
context
of
cases
that
the
litigants
bring
before
the
court.
in
addition,
there
is
stare
decisis,
and
the
concomitant
imperative
that
courts
justify
departures
from
precedent
of
the
sort
your
honor's
hypothetical
posits,
with
reasons,
and
with
some
neutral
principles
of
general
applicability
and
some
consideration
of
the
impact
of
the
change
they're
about
to
make,
not
only
on
the
litigants
before
them,
but
on
all
similarly
situated
litigants.
i
think
all
of
those
traditional
restraints
operate
to
justify
different
treatment
for
court
decisions
as
opposed
to
decisions
of
legislatures,
and
certainly
the
history
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause
indicates
that
the
framers
were
acutely
aware
of
those
distinctions,
and
because
of
a
well-documented
history
of
parliamentary
abuse
involving
legislation
of
this
sort
they
thought
it
essential
to
insert
a
prophylactic
prohibition
against
legislation
of
this
sort
without
regard
to...
they
weren't
going
to
look
into
the
fairness
of
individual
pieces
of
legislation
and
the
circumstances
under
which
they
were
passed.
they
erected
a
prophylactic
bar
to
legislation
of
that
sort
at
all.
mr.
michael
e.
moore
your
honor,
i
think
the
due
process
clause
and
the
ex
post
facto
clause
also
are...
serve
very
different
functions
under
our
constitutional
scheme.
as
i
indicated,
the
ex
post
facto
clause
is
this
sort
of
structural
restraint
on
the
power
of
that
branch
of
government,
but
due
process,
litigation
under
the
due
process
clause
is
by
its
very
nature
case
by
case,
and
the
concern
of
the
due
process
clause
is
individualized
fair
treatment,
so
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
nature
of
the
due
process
guarantee
to
build
into
it
some
sort
of
prophylactic
structural
restraint
on
the
judicial
branch
because
of
concerns
that
the
judicial
branch
in
modern
times
engages
in
too
much
law
reform.
it
seems
to
me
that
due
process,
the
due
process
clause,
with
its
concern
about
individualized
fair
treatment,
is
up
to
the
task
of
protecting
against
aberrational
cases
in
which
a
court
is
self-evidently
engaged
in
some
sort
of
arbitrary
or
vindictive
action
that...
of
the
sort
that
violates
our
notions
of
fundamental
fairness
and
our
notions
about
the
rule
of
law.
to
close,
our
position
is
that
the
due
process
clause
was
not
violated
here,
and
that
the
due
process
clause
is
not
violated
by
a
court
decision
of
this
sort
that
retroactively
alters
a
rule
of
criminal
law
unless
that
change
expands
the
scope
of
conduct
covered
by
the
criminal
prohibition
issue
and
does
so
unforeseeably.
secondarily,
our
position
is
that
the
ex
post
facto
clause
simply
doesn't
regulate
judicial
action
at
all,
and
that
none
of
its
technical
restrictions
should
be
imported
wholesale
into
the
due
process
clause.
thank
you
very
much.
