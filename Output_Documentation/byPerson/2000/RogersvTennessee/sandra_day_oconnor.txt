mr.
ward,
there...
this
case
has
an
aura
of
unreality
about
it.
your
client
apparently
attempted
to
murder
the
victim
by
stabbing
him
in
the
heart
with
a
butcher
knife.
now,
he
didn't
have
any
settled
expectation
that
he
wasn't
going
to
be
accused
of
murder,
and
yet
he
wants
to
take
advantage
of
this
year-and-a-day
rule.
i
mean,
what
does
it
serve?
it's
some
concept
of
fair
warning
or
expectation,
but
at
the
time
the
crime
was
committed,
i
guess
he
hoped
the
victim
would
die,
and
i
don't
see
that
your
client
has
been
deprived
of
any
kind
of
an
expectation.
justice

regardless
of
what
we
do
with
the
year-and-a-day
rule.
