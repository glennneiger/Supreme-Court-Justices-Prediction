well,
i
was
just
going
to
say,
wasn't
it
assumed
by
the
tennessee
supreme
court
that
this
was
a
substantive
rule
of
law,
and
that
you
agreed
that
it
was
but
argued
that
it
had
been
repealed
by
the
1989
revision
of
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
court
rejected
that
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
is
it
still
not
correct
that
you
would
agree
that
it's
a
substantive
principle
of
law,
or
are
you
taking
a
different--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--let
me
ask
you
just
a
little
refinement
of
the
question.
supposing
you
had
prevailed
on
the
view
that
the
1989
statute
had
discarded
this
or
changed
this
substantive
rule
of
law,
would
you
think
that
you
could
then
have
prosecuted
someone
who
had
committed
the
crime
before
the
1989
statute
went
into
effect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
then
you
wanted
to
indict
someone
who
had
committed
the
same
kind
of
offense
prior
to
1989.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there
you're
placing
a
label
on
it,
and
i
thought
the
label
didn't
matter.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
not
for
due
process
purposes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
rogers
versus
tennessee,
no.
99-6218.
the
opinion
for
the
court
has
been
authored
by
the
justice
o'connor
and
i
have
been
asked
to
announce
it.
petitioner
wilbert
rogers
was
convicted
in
the
tennessee
state
court
of
second
degree
murder.
petitioner
had
stabbed
a
man
and
the
victim
died
fifteen
month
later.
on
appeal
of
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
the
petitioner
argued
that
the
common
law
“year
and
a
day
rule”
precluded
his
convection.
at
common
law
that
the
“year
and
a
day
rule”
provided
that
no
defendant
could
be
convicted
of
a
murder,
unless
his
victim
had
died
by
the
defendants
act
within
a
year
and
a
day.
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
affirmed
the
conviction,
the
court
have
abolished
the
“year
and
a
day
rule”
as
a
matter
of
common
law
of
tennessee.
after
concluding
that
their
reasons
for
recognizing
the
rule
of
common
law
no
longer
existed,
the
court
further
concluded
that
application
have
its
decision
to
the
petitioner
would
not
violate
due
process
concerned
with
retroactivity
under
this
court’s
decision
in
bouie
versus
city
of
columbia.
we
granted
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
tennessee,
and
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
that
court.
our
case
in
bouie
involves
the
retroactive
application
of
judicial
construction
of
a
criminal
statute.
we
held
in
bouie
that
due
processes
prohibits
a
retroactive
application,
only
where
that
judicial
construction
is
unexpected
and
indefensible,
by
reference
to
the
law
which
had
been
expressed
prior
to
the
conduct
in
issue.
now,
bouie
did
not
incorporate
the
specific
prohibitions
of
the
constitution’s
ex
post
facto
clause
into
due
processes
limitations
on
retroactive
judicial
decision
making
rather
bouie’s
rationale
rested
on
core
due
process
concepts
of
notice,
foreseeability,
and,
in
particular,
the
right
to
fair
warning.
now
that
criminal
penalties
may
attach
to
what
previously
had
been
innocent
conduct.
petitioner’s
case
involves
a
retroactive
judicial
alteration
of
a
common
law
rule,
as
apposed
to
retroactive
judicial
interpretation
of
a
statute.
the
standard
articulated
in
bouie,
we
believe,
is
appropriate
to
this
common
law
context
as
well
indeed
a
more
stringent
standard
of
the
sort
suggested
by
petitioner
would
unduly
impair
the
incremental
and
reasoned
development
of
precedent.
now,
that
is
the
foundation
of
the
common
law
system.
accordingly,
we
hold
that
a
retroactive
judicial
alteration
of
a
common
low
doctrine
of
criminal
law
does
not
violate
the
principle
of
fair
warning,
unless
it
is
unexpected
and
indefensible
by
reference
to
the
law
which
has
been
expressed
prior
to
the
conduct
in
issue.
the
tennessee
courts’
abolishing
of
the
“year
and
a
day
rule”
was
not
unexpected
and
indefensible;
advances
in
medical
and
related
sciences
have
rendered
the
rule
obsolete.
the
vast
majority
of
jurisdictions
recently
to
have
considered
the
rule
have
abolished
it.
most
important
at
the
time
of
petitioner’s
act,
the
rule
had
only
the
most
tenuous
foothold
as
part
of
tennessee’s
criminal
law.
the
rule
has
been
mentioned
only
three
times
in
dicta
and
all
the
reports
of
tennessee
cases.
it
has
not
served
as
a
ground
of
decision
in
any
murder
prosecution
in
the
state.
now,
there
is
in
short
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
tennessee
court’s
abolishing
of
the
rule
in
petitioner’s
case
represented
the
sort
of
arbitrary
and
unfair
judicial
action
against
which
the
due
process
clause
aims
to
protect.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion;
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens
and
thomas
have
joined
and
in
which
justice
breyer
has
joined
as
to
part
two;
justice

a
dissenting
opinion.
