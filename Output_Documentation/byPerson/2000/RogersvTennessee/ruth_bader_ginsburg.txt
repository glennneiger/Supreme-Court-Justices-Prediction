mr.
ward,
let's
assume
that
the
tennessee
supreme
court
had
simply
affirmed
the
lower
court
that
said
the
legislature
made
this
change,
and
they
made
it
long
before
he
committed
the
crime.
you
would
have
no
issue
at
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
suppose
the
state
is
one,
and
i
don't
know
if
this
is
so,
where
you
couldn't
have
purely
prospective
overruling
because
that
would
be
considered
an
advisory
opinion,
so
here's
the
tennessee
supreme
court
saying,
gee,
it
was
our
mistake
in
not
getting
rid
of
this
obsolete
rule.
it's
our
rule,
not
the
legislature's
rule,
so
we
want
to
get
rid
of
it,
but
we
can't.
we're
saying
it's
our
fault,
not
the
legislature's.
we
can't
change,
however,
because
if
we
apply
it
to
this
case
it's
going
to
be
ex
post
facto,
and
we
can't
simply
prospectively
overrule
without
being
an
advisory
opinion.
so
is
your...
is
the...
at
the
end
of
the
road,
is
your
argument
one
that
a
court
can't
cure
its
own
error
of
this
nature?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
question
didn't
assume
that
it
was
unthinkable.
the
question
was
simply
putting
it
to
you,
is
this
the
end
result?
that
is,
that
the
tennessee
supreme
court
cannot
itself
change
its
rule,
only
the
legislature
can?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
can't
change
it,
because
there'll
never
be
a
case
in
which
they
can
change
it.
in
other
words,
the
court
in
this
situation,
we
can't
change
it
prospectively
because
it
would
be
advisory.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
this
further
question?
suppose
we...
it's
so,
and
we
tell
the
tennessee
supreme
court,
you're
wrong,
this
would
be
an
ex
post
facto
obligation.
it
would
still
be
open
to
the
tennessee
supreme
court,
would
it
not,
to
say,
gee,
we
have
to
rethink
what
that
lower
court
did,
and
we
now
decide
that
they
were
right
after
all,
that
the
legislature
made
that
change
long
before
this
crime
was
committed.
it
would
still...
no
matter
what
we
say
here,
it
would
still
be
open
to
the
tennessee
supreme
court
to
say
the
change
was
already
made
by
the
legislature
and
that
really
ended
the
case,
and
all
this
has
been
kind
of
an
academic
exercise.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
could
change
their
mind,
better
enlightened
by
what's
happened
since
then.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
asked
if
that
would
be
something
that
would
be
open
to
the
tennessee
supreme
court
to
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
can
you
think
of
one?
the
tennessee
supreme
court
says,
gee,
we
got
it
wrong,
that
court
of
criminal
appeals,
they
had
it
right
all
along.
the
legislature
took
care
of
it.
we
don't
have
any
more
year-and-a-day
rule,
haven't
had
one
for
5
years.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
mr.
ward,
with
respect
to
that,
calder
was
itself
dicta,
because
the
case
came
out
the
other
way,
and
there
was
something
said
by
a
justice
and
it
has
become
venerable
over
the
years
just
because
it's
been
repeated
and
applied
as
law
by
later
courts.
but
then,
when
you're
thinking
of
extending
it
under
a
due
process
label,
wouldn't
you
want
to
take
into
account
its
origin,
and
the
compartmentalization
has
been
criticized?
i
mean,
you're
not
bound
to
take
it
over
lock,
stock
and
barrel.
why
should
you,
given
its
origin
as
dictum
and
its
rigidity
with
these
categories?
i
mean,
it's
not
scripture.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
everything
under
the
ex
post
facto
clause
would
be
subsumed
under
due
process
vis-a-vis
the
legislature
too,
is
it,
and
in
fact
that's
what
you're
saying,
isn't
it?
