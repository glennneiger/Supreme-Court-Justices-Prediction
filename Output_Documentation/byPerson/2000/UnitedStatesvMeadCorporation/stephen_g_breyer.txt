justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
could
you
go
back
for
a
second
on
that
to
the
first
question
that
justice
o'connor
put
to
you,
and
she
said
there's
a
statute
that
says,
in
effect,
that
the
court
of
international
trade
is
to
review
these
things
de
novo,
to
which
you
replied
no,
it's
just
reviewing
matters
of
fact.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
my
copy
of
the
statute
says
nothing
about
matters
of
fact.
what
it
says
is,
the
court
of
international
trade
shall
make
its
determinations
upon
the
basis
of
the
record
before
the
court.
the
importers
tell
us,
the
textile
importers
tell
us
there's
hardly
ever
a
dispute
of
fact.
you
know,
this
is
what
it
is.
everybody
knows
that,
that
almost
all
these
things
concern
how
you
apply
a
tariff
or...
to
the
facts
and
the
customs
trade
bar
tells
us
that
if
we
set
down
the
distinction
you
want
to
make
between
facts
and
application
of
the
tariff,
this
whole
thing's
unworkable,
because
people
would
never
be
able
to
figure
out,
or
hardly
ever,
what's
going
on,
which
is
which.
so
that
would
seem
to
be
a
pretty
strong
argument
that
justice
o'connor's
initial
characterization
was
right
as
opposed
to
the
application
of
these
tariffs,
and
i'd
like
you
to
respond
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
didn't
say
that
was
unworkable.
what
they
said
would
be
unworkable
would
be
for
the
court
of
international
trade
to
figure
out,
you
know,
is
it
a
question
of
fact,
is
it
a
determination
of
application
of
the
tariff,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah,
but
the
exact
question
i
think
is,
i
could
imagine...
it's
all
hypothetical...
being
a
member
of
congress
and
if
i
were
asked,
do
you
really
want
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
to
have
some
binding
authority
when
he
writes
a
letter
answering
the
question
that
was
posed,
you'd
say,
yeah,
that's
a
pretty
good
idea.
he
knows
quite
a
lot
about
these
things.
then
similarly,
if
you
were
a
member
of
congress,
you
might
say,
would
you
want
these
several
thousand
customs
inspectors
to
have
the
authority
of
whether
the
word
bound
does
or
does
not
include
these
ring
binders?
well,
you
might
say
yeah,
they
know
a
lot
about
it,
similar
answer.
now,
there's
a
lot
of
confusion
getting
to
whether
you
get
a
firm
position,
but
if
you
get
a
firm
position
at
the
agency,
yes,
defer
to
that.
that's
the
question.
that's
why
i
thought
maybe
your
stronger
point
was
the
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i'd
like
to
hear
both
the
answer
to
that
question
and
something
about
the
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
most
of
these
things
congress
says
nothing.
what
you're
trying
to
do
is
make
sense
of
some
kind
of
statutory
scheme.
looking
at
the
scheme,
would
it
make
sense
to
give
the
power
to
make
somewhat
binding
rulings
under
chevron
to
this
particular
official
in
this
kind
of
instance
under
these
circumstances.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
how
i'd
look
at
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--do
you
accept
what
justice
scalia
just
said...
i'm
quite
curious
about
that...
that,
i'd
thought
the
difference
between
this
and
smiley
is,
here
there
is
a
specific
statute,
and
that
statue
says
that
the
court
of
international
trade
will
make
its
determinations
de
novo?
now,
the
government
says
that
that
word,
determinations,
means
simply
matters
of
fact,
not
matters
of
whether,
given
agreement
about
the
facts,
this
is
a
bound
or
unbound
thing
for
purposes
of
the
tariff.
is
that...
in
other
words,
do
you
agree
with
what...
he
wasn't
saying
it
particularly,
but
i
mean,
do
you
agree
with
that
characterization,
that
determinations
cover
only
matters
of
fact?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
actually,
if
you
have
an
extra
minute,
if
it's
all
right
i'd
like
to
go
back
for
1
second
on
the
word
determinations.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
government
has
also
argued,
and
i
wondered
about
this,
i
want
to...
that
really
we
decided
in
haggar
that
that
word
determinations
must
refer
only
to
factual
and
not
legal
determinations.
i'd
like
to
know
your
response
to
that.
