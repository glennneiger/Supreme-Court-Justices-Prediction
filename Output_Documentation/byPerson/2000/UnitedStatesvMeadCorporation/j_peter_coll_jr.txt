mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
you
are,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start
by
picking
up
on
a
question
that
justice
souter
just
asked,
and
that
is,
may
it
be
revoked,
may
it
be
modified
without
further
proceeding
between
the
customs
service
and
the
importer,
and
at
the
time
that
these
rulings
issued,
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
there
was
no
notice
required.
as
the
record
reflects,
in
june
of
1991
they
classified
this
day
planner
as
a
unbound
diary,
duty
free.
in
1993,
without
notice,
without
any
further
proceeding,
a
letter
was
received
from
the
customs
service
saying
that
that
classification
had
been
changed.
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
no.
we--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--we
had
the
opportunity,
which
we
took
advantage
of,
which
was
to
get
a
detrimental
reliance
letter
from
the
customs
service
that
said
to
the
effect
that
those
imports
that
were
in
process
we
were
able
to
rely
on
the
previous
ruling,
on
the
previous
classification
ruling,
but
that
we
could
not
rely
in
the
future,
so
that
the
first
revocation
allowed
us
to
take
those
orders
that
we
had
in
process
and
bring
them
in
duty
free,
but
thereafter
we
now
had
duty
attached.
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
there
is
now
a
notice
provision
that
requires
publication
in
the
customs
bulletin.
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
i
don't
have
it
by
the
page,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
that's
correct,
and
its
reflected
in
the...
in
19
c.f.r.--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--it
was
not.
it
was
not
in
force
at
that
time.
there
was...
there's
a
second
notice
provision
that
has
been
raised
by
the
government
in
its
brief,
and
that
relates
to
change
in
practice,
but
this
was
not
a
change
in
practice,
either,
as
the
courts
have
defined
that
particular
regulation,
so
that
the
importer
here
received
a
classification
ruling
in
1991.
it
was
revoked
in
1993
without
further
proceeding.
now--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--well,
i
think
it's
probably
a
matter
of
practice
as
much
as
it
is
a
matter
of
the
interpretation
of
the
rules,
or
the
regulations.
under
19
c.f.r.
177.9
it
sets
forth
very
clearly
who
may
rely
on
a
particular
classification
ruling.
the
importer
may
rely
who
has
sought
the
classification
ruling
on
that
ruling
for
those
goods
in
similar
circumstances.
that
is
who
may
definitely
rely.
other
importers
may
rely,
may...
but
they
are
not
certain
that
it
is
even
in
effect
any
longer
because
of
the
way
the
rule...
because
of
the
way
the
service
runs
its
classification
rulings,
and
it
says...
and
this
is
where
the
solicitor
general
took
me
to
task,
i
think,
is
that
there's
a
second
sentence
that
says,
if
you
want
to
know
what
the
current
ruling
is,
you
can
contact
us
and
by
the
way,
send
us
enough
information
so
we
can
figure
out
what
it
is
that
may
pertain
to
you,
so
it
is
not--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--i
don't
think
it's
a
prospective
determination.
what
they
can
get
is
a
current
status
of
how
a
particular
good
has
been
classified
for
a
particular
importer
at
a
given
point
in
time.
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
whether--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--no,
i
don't
believe
it
does.
the
problem
here,
as
i
see
it,
to
ask
for
chevron
deference,
which
i
view
as
mandatory,
controlling
weight
deference,
rather
than
skidmore
deference--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--well,
i
would
focus
on
the
question
in
that
case
as
posed
by
justice
ginsburg,
which
said,
may
or
can
national
banks
in
the
united
states
sell
variable
annuities,
question
mark,
and
that
was...
as
i
understood
that
question,
viewed
by
this
court,
that
ruling
was
now
going
to
be
applicable
to
every
national
bank
in
the
united
states
and
as
i've
just
discussed--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--i
don't
think
we
can
assume
that.
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
i
don't
think
we
can
assume
that.
the
problem
is
that
by
definition
of
the
regulations
of
the
service
itself,
these
are
applications
of
the
customs
law
to
the
specific
facts
presented
by
the
importer,
and--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--for
purposes
of
4820
i
think
we
can.
i
don't
know--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--the
statute,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
a
statute
of--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--19
u.s.a.
section
4820.
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
well,
we
don't
know
that
under
the
particular
section
of
177.9
of
their
regulations,
because
they
tell
us
similar
articles,
or
identical
articles
or
similar
circumstances,
and
therefore
they
hedge
that
relative
to
every
importer
who
comes
to
a
dock--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--i
don't
know.
i'd
suspect
not,
but
i
don't
know.
but
what
we
have
here,
just
to
look
at
the
record,
we
start
out
in
1991
with
an
identical...
the
same
product
that
we
had
in
1993
and
that
we
had
in
1994,
when
it
made
it
into
headquarters
and
their
view
changed.
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
well--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--well,
i'd
like
to
go
to
what
congress
may
have
said
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
the
customs
service
should
be
binding,
and
we
looked
to
the
legislative
history
in
1979
with
regard
to
de
novo
review,
and
that
legislative
history
said,
in
light
of
the
zenith
radio
case
it's
precedents
suggested
that
deference
should
be
given
to
the
customs
service
rulings,
that--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
i--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--and
responding
to
that
question--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--i
believe
the
answer
is
no,
that
skidmore
deference
would
be
appropriate,
but
chevron
deference
would
be
inappropriate.
to--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--well,
that
question,
as
i
would
understand
it,
starts
from
the
premise
that
we're
going
to
somehow
narrow
this
field
of
classification
rulings
from
the
10
to
15,000
that
issue
each
year
to
some
smaller
group
that
purportedly
are
qualitatively
better,
certainly
quantitatively
less,
and
if
that's
the
case,
then
i
think
we
also
need
to
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
these
are
mixed
conclusions
of
fact
and
law,
even
when
articulated.
and
for
example,
in
our
particular
ruling,
the
third
ruling,
the
one
that
i
assume
the
solicitor
general
says
that
the
deference
to
attach...
should
attach
to,
not
the
earlier
ones,
the
last.
there,
the...
mr.
durant,
who
was
the
fellow
who
exercised
that
discretion,
that
interpretation,
and
who
signed
that
letter,
says
that
he
has
reached
his
interpretation
on
the
basis
of
factual
analysis,
ex
parte
factual
analysis,
ex
parte
to
anything
that
this
importer
had
an
opportunity
to
respond
to.
it
says...
this
is
at
32a
of...
it
begins
at
the
bottom
of
31a.
it's
32a
in
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari,
and
it
says,
the
rationale
for
this
determination
was
based
on
lexicographic
sources
as
well
as
extrinsic
evidence
of
how
these
types
of
articles
are
treated
in
the
trade
and
commerce
of
the
united
states.
now,
that
record
was
made--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--that's
correct,
and
it's
as
to
facts,
and
it's
part
of
the
process.
i
mean,
this
process--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--exactly.
what
we
have
here--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--it's--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--well,
i
beg
to
differ.
i
think
it
is
a
question
of
fact.
the
government,
the...
as
well
as
the
importer
treat
it
as
a
question
of
fact.
on
the
filing
of
the
action
in
the
court
of
international
trade,
both
parties
filed...
the...
both
parties
filed
affidavits,
affidavits
relating
to
the
facts,
relating
to
commercial
use,
relating
to
commercial
jargon
as
to
how
these
products
were
described
within
the
trade,
and
so
both
sides
here
treated
that
portion
as
being
an
item
of
fact.
and
i
don't
think
that
it
makes
much
sense,
when
we
talk
chevron
deference,
we
talk
about
the
haggar
case,
which
says
that
haggar
stems...
that
deference
stems
from
the
creation
of
a
legal
norm,
to
put
to
the
court
on
a
mandatory
basis
deference
that
has
a
mixed
question
of
fact,
or
a
mixed
conclusion
of
fact
and
law,
and
say
to
them,
now,
you
may
apply
whatever
that
is
to
what
remains
of
the
facts.
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
that
goes
to
the
second
question
that
was
certified,
which
is...
and
we
approach
it
under
skidmore...
does
this
have
persuasive
effect,
the
power
to
persuade,
and
we
say
it
has
absolutely
none
for
any
number
of
reasons.
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
no.
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
because
i
don't
think
the
one
can
dissect
even
this,
what
the
solicitor
general
would
concede
is
as
elaborate
a
classification
ruling
as
one
normally
finds
that
one
can
dissect
the
fact
from
the
law.
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
well,
haggar--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--haggar
is
a
much
different
situation,
your
honor.
haggar
arose
when
congress
passed
a
particular
provision
of
the
tariff
schedule
that
left
a
gap
to
be
filled,
and
they
delegated
that
filling
of
the
gap,
specific
gap
to
the
customs
service.
it
was
matters
incidental
to
assembly
outside
of
the
united
states,
and
it
listed
such
as,
it
left
obvious
gaps
for
filling.
they
went,
and
on
a
notice
and
comment
basis,
had
a
regulation
promulgated
that
furthered
that
definition.
i
don't
view
it
as
interpretive.
i
view
it
as
legislative,
and
that's
what
the
customs
service
did,
and
this
court
found
that
that
created
normal
law
similar
to
a
statute.
that--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--it
impacted
it
in
a
slightly
different
fashion.
it
impacted
it
in
that
there
was
no
interpretation
left
of
the
law.
the
statute,
or
the...
it...
the
promulgation
of
the
regulation,
notice
and
comment
regulation
now
told
us,
this
is
what
is
or
isn't
incidental.
now
we
had...
the
question
that
remained
was
what
had
occurred
outside
of
the
united
states,
and
did
that
fall
within
that
language,
so
that
now
we
were
focused,
as
i
understand
this
court's
direction,
on
that
fact,
what
was
happening
outside
the
united
states,
and
does
it
fit
into
that
articulated
definition
in
the
regulation.
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
no,
because--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--i
would
take
the
position
that
the
interpretation
at
first
blush
and
upon
further
analysis
is
unreasonable.
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
yes.
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
that's
one
possible
interpretation,
and
the
question
then
becomes
whether
or
not--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--well,
their
interpretation
is
predicated
upon
one
provision,
an
explanatory
note
that
isn't
applicable
at
that
level
of
the
tariff
schedule,
which
doesn't
relate
to
whether
or
not
things
are
bound.
it
relates
to
what
things
are
made
of.
the
schedule,
this
particular
provision,
this
particular
chapter,
4820,
relates
to
paper,
and
what
this
explanatory
note
says,
if
things
come
with
packaging
that
has
metal,
leather,
et
cetera,
they
will
still
be
classified
as
paper
that
the
other
substance,
the
other
material
will
not
predominate.
everything
here
in
4820
has
to
be
held
together
in
some
fashion,
because
the
chapter
note
says
that
these...
this
provision
does
not
cover
loose
sheets,
so
everything
has
to
be--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--it's
a
burden-of-proof
issue,
your
honor.
it's
a
matter
that
because
there's
a
presumption
of
correctness,
then
the
burden
is
slightly
different
on
the
plaintiff,
the
importer,
than
it
might
otherwise
be,
that
he
has
a
presumption
that
is
working
against
him,
and
it's
a
burden
of
proof.
it
doesn't
relate
to
deference.
but
focusing
on
chapter
4820
and
why
this
is
not
appropriate
interpretation
and
would
be
unreasonable
even
under
chevron,
though
we
don't
believe
chevron
applies,
the
statute
is
fairly
clear.
the
statute
tells
us
that
there
are
diaries,
and
there
are
similar
articles,
and
then
breaks
it
down
further
to
diaries
bound
in
all
these
other
items
that
would
be
similar
articles.
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
well,
i'm
going
to
have
to
defer
at
this
point
in
time
to
customs
practitioners,
who
tell
me
that
you
cannot
look
in
a
classification
as
to
this
product
at
those
other
two,
either
by
way
of
combination,
because
that
isn't
the
way
the
law
gets
interpreted
in
combination
products
that
exist
elsewhere,
so--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--well,
i
think
that
we
have
to
start
at
the
top,
because
that's
what
the
chapter
notes
tell
us.
the
chapter
notes
tell
us...
and
the
chapter
notes
are
statutory,
and
the
chapter
notes
tell
us
that
we
have
to
start
at
4820.
we
can't
start
at
4820.10.20,
or
at
4810.40.
we
have
to
start
at
the
top,
and
our
argument
is
centered
on
the
fact
that
it's
diaries
and
similar
articles.
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
but
we
weren't
classified
as
an
address
book,
and
we
weren't
classified
as
a
notebook.
we
were
classified
as
a
bound
diary,
and
the
other
two
cannot
support
this
classification.
this
classification
was
very
simply
made
and
very
simply
stated.
it
doesn't
say--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--we...
yes.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--correct.
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
right.
that
was
part
of
what
they
refer
in
the
customs
bar
as
the
mod
act.
it
was
not
in
effect
at
the
time
that
we
were...
this
ruling
came
down.
there's
a
second
feature
out
there
that
relates
to--
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
--i
think
it
enhances
part
of
their
argument.
it
does
not
enhance
their
whole
case,
because
i
believe
that
it
does
not
enhance
the
particular
point,
which
is
that
these
are
conclusions
of
fact
and
law
as
to
which
one
cannot
dissect
neatly
those
interpretive
legal
norms
that
would
be
required
for
chevron
deference.
but
in
terms
of
process,
in
terms
of
notice,
in
terms
of
procedural
regularity,
it
certainly
is
better
than
receiving
a
letter
in
the
mail
2
years
after
you've
gotten
a
classification
ruling
telling
you
that
the
classification
ruling
no
longer
is
effective.
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
yes.
mr.
j.
peter
coll,
jr.
as
i
read
the
haggar
decision,
there
was
an
argument
made
at
that
time
that
haggar,
or
the
class...
the
regulation
at
issue
in
haggar
was
not
entitled
to
chevron
deference.
it
was
not
entitled
to
any
deference
because
of
de
novo
review.
we
have
a
legislative
regulation
there
and
as
i
understand
the
court,
the
court
was
trying
to
explain
how
those
two
elements,
a
statutory
regulation
that
creates
a
legal
norm,
would...
could
still
be
harmonized
with
the
de
novo
review
feature,
and
used
as
an
