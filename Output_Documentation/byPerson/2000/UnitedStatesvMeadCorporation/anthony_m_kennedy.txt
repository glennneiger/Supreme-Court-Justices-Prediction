suppose
we
were
to
hold--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--suppose
we
were
to
hold
that
chevron
deference
applies
to
regulations
that
are
adopted
under
the
epa
with
notice
and
comment,
and
that
this
does
not
qualify,
but
that
this
ruling,
or
this
determination
gets
a
skidmore
deference.
do
you
think
that
the
courts
would
find
that
that's
a
meaningful
difference?
oh,
this
is
just
a
skidmore
case
and
therefore
i
can
rule
as
follows.
if
it
had
been
a
chevron
case,
i
would
have
to
rule--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--okay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
one
of
your
earlier
responses,
your
first
response
i
think
to
justice
o'connor,
you
said,
oh,
no,
skidmore
deference
would
be
inappropriate.
as
a
fallback
position,
if
we
say,
no
chevron
deference,
i
assume
you
would
urge
some
sort
of
skidmore--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
you
say
skidmore
is
inappropriate
in
order
to
urge
upon
us
chevron--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
do
you
disagree
with
haggar?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
sounds
to
me
like
you're
disagreeing
with
haggar
in
your
answer
to
justice
breyer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
didn't
that
constrain
or
modify
or
elaborate
the
term,
de
novo,
in
the
court
of
international
trade's
jurisdictional
standards,
just
as
much
as
this
case
does?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
ask
you
again
about
the
statute
that's
quoted
at
page
3
of
the
government's
brief,
which,
as
i
understand
it,
indicates
that
if
a
proposed
interpretive
ruling
modifies
an
earlier
ruling,
there
has
to
be
publication
in
the
customs
bulletin.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
that
is
inapplicable
to
the
case
before
us?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
that
this
statute
would
be
very
important
in
another
case,
insofar
as
whether
or
not
these
rulings
are...
should
be
accorded
chevron
deference
because
they're
very
much
like
a
regulation,
or
do
you
think
both
cases,
a
case
arising
under
this
statute
and
your
case,
should
be
dealt
with
the
same?
