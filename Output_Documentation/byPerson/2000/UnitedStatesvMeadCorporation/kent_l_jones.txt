mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
harmonized
tariff
schedule
employs
more
than
9,000
individual
categories
and
more
than
half-a-million
words
to
classify
every
conceivable
article
of
commerce
for
tariff
purposes.
this
massive
document
was
drafted
initially
by
an
international
commission,
and
in
1988
it
was
enacted
in
its
entirety
as
a
law
of
the
united
states.
two
terms
ago
in
the
haggar
case
this
court
held
that
courts
should
defer
to
the
reasonable
interpretive
regulations
adopted
by
the
customs
service
to
implement
these
complex
tariff
provisions.
in
the
present
case,
however,
the
federal
circuit
held
that
it
would
give
no
weight
whatever
to
the
interpretive
rulings
adopted
by
the
customs
service
to
apply
the
tariff
provisions
in
specific
situations
under
the
very
same
statutory
provisions.
the
court,
having
concluded
it
would
give
no
deference
to
the
agency
rulings,
then
held
that
the
particular
item
involved
in
this
case,
known
as
a
date
planner,
would
not
constitute
a
bound
diary
within
the
specific
meaning
of
the
tariff
provision
we
have
here
before
us.
in
our
view,
the
court's
method
of
analysis
and
its
ultimate
classification
determination
are
both
incorrect.
in
enacting
a
harmonized
tariff
schedule,
congress
specified
that...
its
understanding
and
intent
that
the
customs
service
would
be
responsible
for
interpreting
and
applying
these
provisions,
and
for
that
purpose
congress
gave
broad
and
varied
types
of
interpretive
authority
to
the
agency.
in
particular,
in
19
u.s.c.
1502,
congress
provided
that
the
agency
could
adopt
rules
and
regulations
for
the
classifications
of
goods
under
the
tariff
schedules,
and
it
was
under
that
provision
that
this
court
applied
chevron
and
haggar
to
say
that
reasonable
interpretations
of
ambiguous
provisions
set
forth
in
regulations
should
be
applied
by
the
courts.
now,
congress
understood,
however,
that
the
regulations
alone
would
not
be
sufficient
to
address
the
infinite
myriad
of
small
interpretive
problems
that
arise
under
this
kind
of
tariff
legislation,
and
so
congress
specified
and
gave
authority
to
the
agency
to
adopt
binding
interpretive
rules
for
the
purpose
of
applying
the
statute
in
these
discrete
situations.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
the...
we
have
used
that
expressing
in
describing
it--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--but
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
haggar,
and
as
we
have
argued
in
these
two
cases,
what
really
happens
is
there
is
a
de
novo
fact-finding
on
the
record
made
in
the
court
of
international
trade.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
haggar
also
pointed
out
that
what
the
court
does
is,
in
determining
what
the
law
is
that
it
applies
these
facts
to,
it
looks
to
the
agency's
interpretations,
and
we
think
it
should
look
to
the
agency's
rulings.
that's--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
what
they
have--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--our...
what
we
are
urging
you
is
that
it
is
the
deference
that
the
court
described
in
chevron,
that
is
that
you...
that
the
court
is
to
defer
to
the
reasonable
interpretations
set
forth
in
these
binding
rulings,
and
what...
in
the
nationsbank
v.
variable
annuity
case
the
court
described
these
as
a
deliberative
conclusions
set
forth
in
the
agency's
interpretations.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
not
in
this
context.
i
mean,
let
me
point
out
that
when
we're
talking
about
interpretive
rulings
they
are
routinely
initiated
by
the
importer
themselves.
the
importer
has
ample
opportunity
to
make
comments
on
how
they
think
this
procedure
should
be...
how
that
statute
should
be
interpreted,
and
when
the
agency...
if
the
agency
adopts
that
interpretation
and
then
some
other
importer
doesn't
agree
and
they
want
to
ask
for
a
different
ruling,
they
can
submit
and
request
an
interpretive
ruling,
and
that's
what's--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--in
christiansen
the
court
said
that
there
was
an
informal
opinion
stated
in
a
format
that
congress
had
not
provided
for
official
interpretations.
here,
we
have
a
formal
provision
of
congress
directing
the
agency
to
make
these
kinds
of
interpretive
determinations
and
to
make
them
in
a
binding
way.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
believe
that's
correct.
the
court
concluded
that
it
was
not,
in
the
words
of
skidmore,
entitled
to
any
consideration
because
it
wasn't
persuasive,
but
i...
clearly
the
court
was
of
the
view
that
it
was
not
a
reasonable
interpretation,
and--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
historically
we
know
the
court
said
that
it
would
defer
to
reasonable
interpretations
of
the
service,
but
in
this...
you're
very
right
about
the
oddity
of
the
specific
issue,
the
way
it
came
up,
and
we
addressed
that
at
the
petition
stage.
what
happened
was
that
when
haggar
was
before
this
court,
the
united
states
did
not
press
the
lower
court
to
apply
what
is
now
to
be
called
haggar
or
chevron
deference
because
the
federal
circuit
had
said
in
haggar
that
it
would
give
no
weight
to
customs
service
interpretations,
and
so
at
the
time
the
case
was
in
the
court
of
international
trade,
that
court
was
not
asked
to
give
that
type
of
deference
to
the
agency's
interpretation--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--because
that
was
the
law
of
the
circuit.
once
this
court
reversed
the
circuit
ruling
in
haggar,
this...
the
federal
circuit
then
addressed
how
the
principles
of
haggar
and
chevron
applied.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in
the
federal
circuit,
but
i
would
point
out
that
respondent
has
agreed,
and
we
think
it's
clear
that
the
court
of
international
trade
applied
the
same
definition
of
bound
diary
that
the
ruling
sets
forth.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
let
me
address
the
second
point
first.
i
think
in
smiley
v.
citibank
the
court
had
a
similar
situation
where
there
was
a
subsidiary
determination
that
was
then
reviewed
by
the
headquarters
office
to
result
in
a
final
agency
determination,
which
is
the
process
that
we've
gone
through
with
respect
to
these
rulings,
and
the
court
said,
well,
that
doesn't
result
in
a
change
of
view,
it
results
in
a
proper
application
of
the
agency's
ruling
process.
with
respect
to
the
first
point,
the
respondent
says,
well,
there
are
10,000
a
year
of
these
kinds
of
rulings
made
in
the
head...
in
the
regional
offices.
in
fact,
we
do
not
claim
that
there's...
we
are
unaware
of
any
of
those
rulings
in
which
there
would
be
what
the
court,
in
the
opinion
you
authored
for
the
court
in
the
variable
annuity
case
call
the
deliberative
conclusions.
it
is
only
the
deliberative
conclusions
that
set
forth
the
actual
interpretations
of
provisions
that
the
court
can
look
to
to
defer
to.
it's
not
simply
the
result.
and
in
most
of
the
simple
tariff
entry
at
issue
determinations,
of
course
it's
a
very
simplified
procedure.
it
has
to
be,
because
of
the
volume
of
transactions
at
issue,
and
those
kinds
of
entry-level
port
determinations
are
very
simple,
and
the
trade
bar
association
brief
acknowledges
they
contain
in
almost
every
instance
no
discussion.
they
just
contain
the
sort
of
a
statement
that
12
apples
come
in
as
apples.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
and
the
agency
has--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
don't
believe
you
have
to.
i--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
agency...
it's
an
election
of
the
importer
whether
he
wants,
whether
he
can
ask...
he
can
ask
the
headquarters
for
a
ruling
in
the
first
instance.
he
can
ask
the
headquarters
to
review
a
field
determination.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
is
correct.
to
the
extent--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--as
a
practical
matter,
that's
true,
but
i
would
say
that
either
of
them
would
be
entitled
to
deference
to
the
extent
they
contain
deliberative
conclusions,
and
i'm
just
being
finicky
about
that
because
as
a
practical
matter
the
entry-level
port
determinations
don't
contain
those
kinds
of--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
think
as
a
practical
matter
the
agency
would
have
no
objection
to
a
determination
of
that
type.
it's
just,
all
i'm
addressing
is
the
logical
basis
by
which
the
court
would
reach
such
a
determination.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the...
i'm
not...
i
think
what
i'm
trying
to
describe
and
not
doing
a
very
good
job
at
it
is
simply
that
it's
up
to
what...
the
ultimate
question
is
what
did
congress
intend?
how
did
congress
intend
the
agency
to
function?
the
best
evidence
of
that
is
probably
the
agency's
regulations
pursuant
to
the
authority
that
congress
gave
the
agency
to
provide
for
a
binding
ruling
program.
the
agency's
regulations
specify
that
the
port
service's
rulings
are
precedential
and
binding,
but
they
don't
go
on
to
say,
because
it's
up
to
this
court
to
say,
the
extent
to
which
those
precedential
binding
determinations
are
to
be
given
deference
by
the
courts,
and
all
i
was
trying
to
say
was
that
it
seems
to
me
that
when
this
court
has
addressed
interpretive
rulings
in
prior
cases,
like
variable
annuity,
pbgc
v.
ltc,
it
has
looked
to
the
question
of
whether
the...
you
can
look
to
the
interpretation
expressed
by
the
agency--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--and
find
in
it
a
reasoned--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--not
in
the
sense
that
we're
using
that
term
in
this
case.
what
christiansen
was
was
the
private
correspondence
that
was
sent--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
actually
it
was
sent
by
the
wage
&
hour
division
of
the
labor
department.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
right,
but
what
the...
but
i
think
what
this...
the
court's
concern
in
christiansen
was
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
that
was
an
official
interpretation
of
the
type
that
congress
had
authorized
the
agency
to
use
to
interpret
the
statute.
here,
we
have
a
statute
that
expressly
tells
the
agency
to
make
these
kinds
of
binding
determinations,
and
the
agency's
done
it
just
the
way
congress
said.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
function
of
the
interpretive
binding
ruling
program
is
to
make
the
system
more
workable
by
providing
effective
advanced
guidance.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's...
this...
i
believe
the
court
has
already
addressed
this
very
point
in
the
haggar
case.
chevron
deference
is
about
how
you
decide
what
the
law
is.
there
are
other
doctrines,
burden
of
proof,
presumption
of
regularity,
that
go
to
about
how
you
decide
what
facts
are
and
how
the
facts
apply
to
law.
chevron
is
simply
a
doctrine
about
how
does
a
court
decide
what
the
law
is,
and
in
this
case
the
agency
made
a
determination
about
legal
issues
and
said
what
it
believed
a
diary
was,
for
example,
or
what
it
believed
the
law,
properly
interpreted
was,
bound
for
this
purpose
is.
having
made
that
legal
determination,
it's
then
up
to
the
court
of
international
trade
to
decide
whether
these
facts
represent
such
an
item.
of
course,
the
agency's
binding
rulings
state
its
own
view
of
what
the
facts
are
and
how
they
apply
to
these
legal
interpretations,
but
that's
what
the
court
of
international
trade
has
the
right
to
do
de
novo,
to
decide
whether
these
facts
fit
within
the
legal
determination,
the
legal
interpretation
that
the
agency
has
expressed
in
the
binding
ruling.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's
just
like
tax
cases.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
addressing
your
practical
question
before
i...
i
do
want
to
respond
to
your
question
about
how
this
might
be
looked
at.
your
practical
question
is,
does
it
make
a
difference.
yes,
it
makes
a
big
difference.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
because
if
we...
if
you
had
the
sort
of
sliding
scale
approach
of
the
skidmore
doctrine,
then
no
one
would
know
until
the
end
of
the
day
what...
you
know,
how
much...
how
effective
the
agency's
interpretation
is,
and
the
advantage
of
the
chevron
approach,
if
you
needed
to
look
at
it
in
a
practical
sense,
is
that
everyone
knows
at
the
outset
what
the
effectiveness
of
the
agency's
interpretation
is.
it's
to
be
upheld
if
it's
reasonable.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
court
has
never
held,
and
would
have
to
overrule
several
cases
if
it
did
now,
that
chevron
deference
requires
that
the
agency
issue
this
regulation
with
notice
and
comment.
there
are
cases
in
which
this
court--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--okay.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
would
assume
that
if
the
court
were
to
conclude
that
chevron
deference
didn't
apply
it
would
then
conclude
skidmore
was
an
appropriate
formula
to
look
at
this
issue
under.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't
really
remember
having
used
that
phrasing.
what
i...
i
think
chevron's
analysis
is
appropriate.
this
court's
applied
it
in
other
interpretive
ruling
situations,
and
only
in
that
sense
is
skidmore
inappropriate.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
right.
with
respect
to
revenue
rulings,
the
history
on
this
is
sort
of
interesting,
and
it'll
take
me
a
minute
to
explain
it
all.
in
united
states
v.
correll,
this
court
held
that
revenue
rulings
should
be
upheld
when
they're
reasonable,
and
the
court
emphasized
that
it
was
based
on
the
expertise
of
the
agency
and
the
fact,
to
quote
the
court,
that
it
doesn't
sit
as
a
committee
of
revision
to
perfect
the
administration
of
the
tax
laws.
the
congress
told
the
agency
to
do
that
by
authorizing
it
to
issue
all
necessary
rules
and
regs.
now,
the
tax
counsel
amici
says
no,
that
case
was
really
about
a
regulation,
not
about
a
ruling.
well,
that's
simply
and
flatly,
clearly
wrong.
the
regulation
they
cite
had
something
to
do
with
the
procedures
as
used
to
make
a
claim
for
a
deduction.
when
justice
marshall
was
solicitor
general,
he
filed
the
government's
brief
in
the
correll
case.
his
successor,
solicitor
general
griswold,
filed
a
reply
brief.
neither
of
those
briefs
mention
any
regulation.
they
rely
just
on
the
revenue
ruling
of
the
service
and
ask
the
court
to
defer
to
it,
which
is
what
justice
stewart's
opinion
for
the
court
said
was
appropriate.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
we
know
exactly
what
they
meant,
if
we...
i
mean,
reading
the
opinion
it
says
that
the
agency's
reasonable
interpretation
should
be
accepted.
it
was
a
pre-chevron
chevron
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
where
it
became
confusing,
and
there's
a
nomenclature
shift
that
occurred
that
really
hasn't
been
addressed.
prior
to
the
1960's,
there
were
two
kinds
of
rulings.
there
were
treasury
decisions
issued
by
the
secretary,
and
there
were
commissioner's
rulings
that
were
published
in
what's
called
the
cumulative
bulletin.
the
cumulative
bulletin
pointed
out
before
1960
that
the
commissioner's
rulings
were
not
approved
by
the
secretary,
therefore
they
weren't
binding
on
the
agency.
in
1961,
the
commissioner
was
given
interpretive
authority
in
a
regulation
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
and
that
interpretive
authority
is
subject,
however,
to
the
approval
of
the
secretary,
and
since
that
time,
what
are
now
called
revenue
rules,
with
a
capital
r,
are
issued
by
the
commissioner
with
the
approval
of
the
secretary.
they
are
functionally
the
same
as
treasury
decisions
were
before
1960,
and
in
the
cases
before
1960
the
court
had
pointed
out
treasury
decisions
were
entitled
to
substantial
deference,
and
even
in
skidmore
the
court
pointed
out
they
were
often
decisive.
after
correll...
i'm
sorry.
after
correll
and
indeed,
i
think
after
chevron,
but
in
any
event
in
that
time
frame,
justice
marshall
wrote
an
opinion
for
the
court,
bringing
this
full
circle,
in
which
he
said
that
a
treasury
decision
issued
in
connection
with
a
customs
ruling
should
be
given...
should
be
accepted
if
it's
reasonably...
if
it's
sufficiently
reasonable.
that's
the
way...
that's
why
i
pointed
out
that
revenue
rulings
and
treasury
decisions
and
customs
interpretive
rulings
have
followed
a
path
that
should
lead
to
the
same
result.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
would
say
only
to
the
extent
that
they
contain
that
kind
of
deliberative
conclusion
that
the
court--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--there
isn't
an
interpretation
stated
in
a
ruling
of
the
type
they're
talking
about,
which
simply
says
an
apple's
an
apple.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
because
to
decide
that
they
have
to
know
what
a
diary
is,
and
that's
a
legal
conclusion.
it's
like
instructing
a
jury.
the
jury
is
instructed
that
a
diary
means
these
things,
and
then
the
jury
decides
whether
this
thing
is
a
diary
under
that
set
of
definitions.
that's
what
haggar
said.
haggar
said
that
it's...
there's
nothing
inconsistent
with
the
responsibility
of
the
court
of
international
trade
to
make
this
de
novo--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--but
they...
to
make
that
second
step,
they
have
to
know
what
the
law
is
and
all...
and
what
haggar
said
and
what
we
think
is
clear
in
chevron
cases
generally,
is
that
in
deciding
what
the
law
is
the
court
should
defer
to
the
agency's
reasonable
interpretations.
it
might
be
that
i
can
make
this
clearer
by
focusing
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
which
would
probably
be
useful
in
any
event.
in
this
case,
the
agency
said
that--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
believe
the
decisions
of
the
court
of
international
trade
are
reviewed
like
the
decisions--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that's
correct.
i
mean,
of
course,
to
the
extent
that
the
court
of
international
trade
makes
factual
determinations,
then
its
determinations--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
would
be
just
like
a
district
court.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in
this
specific--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--okay.
in
this
specific
case,
the
agency,
in
our
view,
reasonably
concluded
that
the
definition
of
a
diary,
which
the
agency
found
from
a
dictionary
to
be--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--they're
supposed
to
decide
whether
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--they're
supposed
to
decide
whether
the
item
that
has
been
brought
to
them--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--constitutes
a
bound
diary,
and
in
deciding
whether
it's
a
bound
diary,
they
have
to
know
what
the
law...
what
that
legal
definition
is
of
a
bound
diary,
and
in
deciding
that,
they're
supposed
to
look
to
the
agency's
interpretation,
if
it's
a
reasonable
one.
and
again,
i
think
i
can
make
this
more
concrete
by
pointing
out
that
the...
here's
the
way
it
worked
in
this
case.
the
ruling
said
that
a
diary
is
a
book
for
the
keeping
of
a
record
of
daily
events,
and
that
that
definition
is
broad
enough
to
encompass
the
commercial
usage
of
that
term,
which
is
a
business
diary,
which
has
been
commonly
employed
and,
under
cases
like
stone
and
downer,
the
agency
and
the
courts
are
supposed
to
consider
in
deciding
what
the
terms
of
the
tariff
provisions
mean.
now,
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
was,
well,
we
think
that...
we
want
to
add
two
things
to
that.
we
want
to
say
it
has
to
be
room
for
extensive
notations,
and
it
has
to
be
retrospective,
but
the
diary
definition
doesn't
say
that
in
the
dictionary.
there...
you
can
find
alternative
dictionary
definitions,
and
the
commercial
usage
is
inconsistent
with
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
is
an
official
agency
position
at
that
point.
the
problem
i've
had
in
giving
an
answer
that's
better
on
this
for
your...
from
your
perspective
is
that
i
don't
under...
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
way
these
decisions
are
made
at
ports
of
entry,
and
the
way
they're
intended
to
be
made
at
ports
of
entry,
there
is
little
in
the
face
of
that
document
that
gives
a
reasoned
explanation
of
the
agency's
interpretation.
by
comparison,
the
headquarters
rulings
are
thorough,
they
provide
a
definite
description
of
the
text,
and
internally
the
agency
has
advised
its
regional
offices
to
not
include
a
full
discussion
of
text,
and
i'm
going
outside
the
record,
but
i
have
to
answer
your
question,
and
internally
the
understanding
is
that
if
the
issue
is
complicated
enough
it
will
get
referred
to
the
headquarters.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
that
complicated
issues
aren't
resolved
at
the
field
office,
but
it
does
mean
that
when
the
field
offices
ordinarily
determine
them
it's
not
with
a
deliberative
explanation.
that...
to
get
that,
you
go
to
the
headquarters.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
statute
and
regulations
specify
that
before
a
ruling
that
has
been
issued
may
be
modified
or
overruled,
public
notice
and
comment,
an
opportunity
to
comment,
has
to
be
given.
that's
in
1625(c).
mr.
kent
l.
jones
they
can't
just
withdraw
it,
and
even
when
they
change
it
for
a
period
of
60
days
there's
an
automatic
protection
of
people
who
are
using
the
old
ruling.
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
time
for
my--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
thank
you.
i
think
i
have
two
points.
justice
breyer,
as
we
understand
the
issue
that
you've
been
addressing,
the
court
expressly
confronted
and
resolved
it
in
the
haggar
case.
the
court
quoted
the
same
provision
of
the
statute
that
you're
quoting
and
said
that
the
responsibility
of
the
court
of
international
trade
to
make
its
determinations
on
the
record
before
it,
meant
that
it
was
to
assemble
the
record
and
make
factual
determinations
and
apply
those
facts
to
the
law,
but
in...
the
court
said
that
deference
can
be
given
to
the
regulations
without
impairing
the
authority
of
the
court
to
make
factual
determinations
and
to
apply
those
determinations
to
the
law
de
novo.
and
what
the
court
said
in
haggar
was
that
the
regulations,
the
interpretive
regulations
of
the
agency
were
part
of
the
law
that
the
court
of
international
trade
was
to
apply,
which
is
our
position
precisely
in
this
case.
i
believe
that...
i
want
to
say
one
more
thing
about
this
deliberative
conclusion
point.
now,
the
cases
that
have
described,
that
you
look
to
the
deliberative
conclusion
to
find...
in
the
interpretive
ruling
to
decide
whether
to
give
deference
to
the
agency's
reasonable
conclusions,
involve
rulings
in
particular.
in
martin
v.
oshrc,
occupational
safety
&
health
review
commission,
the
court
applied
the
same
principle
of
chevron
deference
to
an
agency's
citation
when
the
citation
had
been
issued
in
the...
precisely
in
the
format
that
congress
authorized
for
interpretive
purposes,
so
i
think
you
may
need
to
look
to
the
nature
of
the
regulatory
ruling...
rulemaking
program
to
decide,
you
know,
what
sort
of
specificity
is
required.
but
in
the
context
of
the
customs
service
rulings,
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
you're
going
to
be
looking
at
headquarters
rulings
that
contain
the
deliberative
analysis
to
find
out
what
the
agency's
reasonable
interpretation
is.
