mr.
jones,
could
we
just
back
up
a
bit?
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor
about
the
court
of
international
trade
owing
some
deference--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
the
customs
rulings,
as
far
as
i
recall,
in
this
very
case,
although
the
court
of
international
trade
upheld
the
customs
classification,
there
wasn't
one
word
that
they
said,
so
we
don't
know
from
this
case
what
position
the
court
of
international
trade
takes
on
this
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
that
didn't
happen
until
the
case
was
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--may
i
ask
you
before
we
get
to
the
specific
ruling,
you're
asserting
that
there
should
be
deference
equivalent
to
chevron
deference.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
yet,
as
i
understand
it,
there
are
two
features
of
this
that
would
lead
me
to
hesitate
about
that.
one
is
that
the
vast
majority
of
these
rulings,
as
i
understand
it,
are
just
you'll
classify
this,
you'll
classify
that,
with
no
reasons
elaborated,
and
the
other
is
that
you
don't
have
one
decisionmaker,
as
you
would
have,
say,
for
the
epa.
instead,
you
have
decisions
that
are
dispersed
among
45
ports
of
entry.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
jones,
you
said
something
very
quickly,
but
i
wanted
to
be
sure
i
understood
your
position
about
tax
rulings,
revenue
rulings.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
they
compare
to
customs
classifications,
and
if
you
could
just...
probably
you
made
this
clear
already.
you
are
not
claiming
deference
for
just
stamped,
this,
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
only
when
we
have
a
reasoned
decision
as
we
do
in
this
case.
okay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
pre-chevron,
so
we
don't
know--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--exactly
what
they
meant
by
deference.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jones,
just
before
you
get
there,
and
in
this
picture
of
deference
based
on,
among
other
things,
expertise,
does
the
federal
circuit
in
the
government's
view
owe
any
deference
to
the
court
of
international
trade?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
of
a
district
court,
and
no
special
credit
is
given
to
the
specialization
of
the
court
of
international
trade?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
would
be
just
like
a
district
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
with
no
waiting
period?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
the
very
day
of
the
notice,
it
became
dutiable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
coll,
does
that
get
a
presumption
of
deference...
of
correctness?
that's
the
other
piece
of
this
statute,
that
this
court
of
international
trade
is
supposed
to
accord
decisions
of
customs
a
presumption
of
correctness,
is
that
right,
and
that's
statutory?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
getting
into
the
same
problem
that
we
have
in
discussing
this
with
mr.
jones,
what
is
fact
as
opposed
to
law
in
these
customs
classifications?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
coll
you
were--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
coll,
there's
one
piece
of
this,
before
we
get
to
the
application
of
it,
that
i
find
vastly
puzzling.
maybe
there's
an
easy
answer
to
it.
you
talked
about
the
provision
that
says,
de
novo
review,
but
then
you
quickly
said,
and
yes,
there's
a
presumption
of
correctness.
those
two
seem
to
be
at
loggerheads.
why
are
they
not?
you
told
me
that
the
facts
found
by
customs
get
a
presumption
of
correctness.
on
the
other
hand,
the
facts
are
gone
over
de
novo.
