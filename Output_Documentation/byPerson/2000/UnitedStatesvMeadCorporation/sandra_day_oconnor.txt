mr.
jones,
there
is
kind
of
a
curious
feature.
as
i
understand
it,
if
a
case
on
a
tariff
ruling
were
to
go
to
the
court
of
international
trade--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--as
i
understand
it,
it
engages
in
de
novo
review
of
the
classification
rulings?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
court
affords
some
kind
of
deference
to
the
views
of
the
customs
service,
and
would
it
be
some
kind
of
deference
to
the
ruling
such
as
we
have
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
kind
of
deference
to
do
they
give
it?
is
it
chevron,
or
something
less--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--such
as
so-called
skidmore,
and
what
are
you
urging
us
is
the
proper
rule?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
not
adopted
after
notice
and
comment,
and
so
is
there
some
lesser
kind
of
deference,
such
as
suggested
in
the
skidmore
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
here
we're...
we
get
back
to
something
you've
already
talked
about,
which
is
a
little
curious.
as
i
understand
it,
the
customs
maybe
issues
over
12,000
classification
decisions
annually,
and
only
some
of
them
involve
some
kind
of
legal
conclusion,
or
explanation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
would
say
it's
only
the
latter
that
deserve
chevron
deference?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
not
these
thousands
of
rulings
that
are
issued
every
year.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
on
that
point,
mr.
coll,
this
court
had
a
holding
in
nationsbank
v.
variable
annuity
life
insurance
where
we
held
that
a
letter
ruling
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
warranted
chevron
deference.
how
is
this
different?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
that
we
can
assume
that
the
customs
service
made
clear
that
it
thought
that
anything
like
a
filofax
here
with
the
little
entry
spaces
on
pages
in
a
loose-leaf
binder
met
the
definition.
apparently
that
was
their
idea.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
would
you
concede
that
at
least
the
customs
has
taken
the
position
that
a
loose-leaf
ring
binder
is
bound?
i
mean,
they
at
least
said
that,
apparently.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there's
a
statute--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
refers
to
bound
diaries,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
coll,
let
me
approach
this
from
a
different
vantage
point.
if
we
decide
that
we
do
owe
chevron
deference
to
the
position
taken
by
the
customs
service
in
this
case,
do
you
lose?
is
that
the
end
of
the
matter?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
word
bound
is
open
to
different
interpretations
as
to
what's
bound?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
is
it
open
at
all
to
the
agency
to
decide
that
it
includes
these
ring
binders
as
being
bound?
i
mean,
that
would
be
one
possible
interpretation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
i
would
have
thought,
then,
if
you
apply
chevron
deference
that's
the
end
of
the
case
for
you.
