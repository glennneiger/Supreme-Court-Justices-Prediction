mr.
jones,
could
i
ask
just
one
clarifying
question?
i'm
having
difficulty
drawing
the
line
between
what
it
is
the
international
court
has
to
do
de
novo
and
what
is
entitled
to
deference,
and
i
thought
you
said
that
they're
entitled
to
deference
if
they're
applying...
they're
deciding
whether
a
particular
item
fits
within
the
rule,
whether
a
particular
document
as
we
have
here
is
a
diary
or
not.
why
isn't
that
the
very
thing
that's
supposed
to
be
decided
de
novo
under
what's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
isn't
that
always
what
the
court
of
international
trade
does,
is
decide
whether
the
item
that
is
presented...
there
are
no
disputing
the
facts
about
what
the
item
is,
whether
it
is
the
particular
thing
described
in
the
rule?
isn't
that
what
they
always
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that,
but
what
is
it
that
the
international
trade...
the
court
of...
was
supposed
to
do
in
this
case?
what
did
they
have
to
do
de
novo,
just
decide
that
that
document--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
what
that
document
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
the
one
that's
set
forth
in
page
3
of
the
government's
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
19
u.s.c.
1625?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
was
not
in
force
in
the
case
before
us?
