justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
jones,
i
want
to
get
clear
on
two
points
about
the
deference
that
the
agency
itself
gives
to
these
rulings.
my
two
questions
are
these.
first,
with
respect
to
the
importer
for
whom
the
ruling
was
given
in
the
first
place,
is
it
correct
that
the
government
can
always
in
effect
withdraw
the
ruling
as
a
precedent
for
future
cases
simply
by
telling
the
importer
by
letter
or
otherwise,
you
can't
rely
on
this
prior
ruling?
justice
david
h.
souter
my
second
question
is,
would
you
explain
what
reliance
someone
other
than
the
original
importer
can
place
on
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
so
they
can't
just
withdraw
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
is
there
a
different
regulatory
scheme
in
effect
today?
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
with
respect...
with
respect
to
reliance
by
someone
other
than
the
original
importer,
as
i
recall
the
briefs
there
was
a
difference
of
opinion
between
you
and
mr.
jones
on
that,
and
i
think
his
response
to
you
was
that
the...
that
someone
other
than
the
original
importer
can
rely
unless
notice
is
given
by
the
government.
have
you
resolved
your
difference
on
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
they...
in
any
case
they
can
get
a
prospective
determination
as
long
as
they're
on
their
toes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
does--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
i
had
a
little
difficulty
with
your
argument
there.
if
you
turn
to
pages
17
and
18
of
your
brief,
on
page
18
you
make
that
argument.
you
say,
in
effect,
diaries
bound
is
to
be
contrasted
with
other,
and
one
reason
that
you
say
that
a
diary
does
not
fall...
one
reason
that
you
say
that
this
does
not
fall
within
the
diary
category
is
that
it's
not
adapted
for
exhaustive
recording
of
past
events.
it's
a
schedule.
but
in
the
statute
itself,
which
you
quote
on
the
preceding
page,
on
17,
there
is
the
term
in
4820.10.20,
which
you
quote
only
with
ellipsis,
and
that
term
refers
to
diaries.
it
also
refers
to
notebooks
and
address
books,
bound,
which
does
not
seem
to
carry
the
same
connotation.
the
notebooks
and
address
books
don't
seem
to
carry
any
connotation
one
way
or
the
other
with
respect
to
either
recording
past
events
or
noting
future
schedules.
if
we
don't
engage
in
the
ellipsis
that
you
did
and
we
refer
to
these
other
examples
as
having
some
bearing
on
what
a
diary
is,
your
argument
is
considerably
weaker,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
i
assume
that
they're
not
intending
to...
you
know,
to
exclude
the
interpretive
rule,
you
know,
noscitur
a
sociis.
we
sort
of
know
each
term
by
those
associated
with
it,
and
if
that
interpretive
canon
applies,
then
there
isn't
a
simple
contrast
between
diaries
and
others.
there's
a
contrast
between
diaries,
notebooks,
and
address
books
and
others,
and
notebooks
and
address
books
and
others
do
not
have
the
kind
of
connotation
that
you
want
us
to
read
so
clearly
into
diary.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
understand
your
point
there
perfectly
well,
but
by
the
same
token
we
can't
ignore
48...
4820.10.20,
either,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
as
the
statute
becomes
progressively
more
detailed,
it
becomes
progressively
more
indicative
of
what
it
may
have
in
mind
by
similar
articles,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
by
the
ellipsis
as
you
quote
4810.20
on
page
18,
you
are
in
effect
telling
us
to
ignore
whatever
interpretive
value
there
might
be
to
considering
notebooks
and
address
books,
and
that
does
have
some
interpretive
value,
because
notebooks
and
address
books
do
not
have
a
connotation
of
time
past,
time
future,
in
the
sense
that
your
argument
assumes.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
your
point
is,
we
ignore
them.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
it
presents
the
question
whether
a
classification
ruling
letter
issued
by
the
united
states
customs
service
deserves
judicial
deference.
the
respondent
mead
corporation
imports
day
planners,
which
have
three
ring
binders
with
pages
for
daily
schedules
phone
numbers,
addresses
and
things
like
that.
the
customs
service
classified
the
planners
as
bound
diaries
within
the
meaning
of
the
governing
statute
and
therefore
are
subject
to
tariff.
mead
challenged
the
classification
ruling
and
on
appeal
with
federal
circuit
ruled
in
mead’s
favor,
holding
that
the
imported
products
were
not
bound
diaries
and
therefore
were
not
subject
to
any
tariff.
in
its
decision,
the
federal
circuit
held
that
the
customs’
classification
ruling
was
not
entitled
to
any
deference
by
a
court.
customs,
by
contrast,
contends
that
the
ruling
letter
deserves
the
highest
deference
under
our
decision
in
chevron
against
natural
resources
defense
council.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
federal
circuit
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
we
hold
that
the
federal
circuit
was
correct
in
ruling
that
a
customs
classification
letter
has
no
claim
to
chevron
deference,
but
we
also
hold
that
under
our
decision
in
skidmore
and
swift,
it
is
eligible
to
claim
respect
according
to
its
persuasiveness.
in
chevron,
we
have
recognized
that
congress
often
implicitly
gives
agencies
the
authority
to
interpret
statutes
in
a
way
that
deserves
judicial
deference.
in
other
words
it
can
be
apparent
from
an
agency’s
generally
conferred
authority
and
from
other
statutory
circumstances.
the
congress
would
expect
the
agency
to
be
able
to
be
speak
with
the
force
of
law
when
addressing
ambiguity
in
the
statute
or
filling
a
gap
in
an
enacted
law
even
one
about
which
congress
did
not
have
a
particular
intent.
a
choice
made
in
the
exercise
of
authority
implicitly
delegated
this
way
deserves
judicial
deference
to
the
point
that
a
reviewing
court
must
accept
the
position
taken
by
the
agency
if
congress
has
not
previously
spoken
to
the
point
at
issue
and
if
the
agency’s
interpretation
is
reasonable.
one
very
good
indicator
of
delegation
narrating
chevron
treatment,
but
not
the
only
one,
is
an
express
congressional
authorization
to
engage
in
the
rule
making
or
the
adjudication
process
that
produced
the
regulation
or
ruling
for
which
deference
is
claimed.
as
a
result,
the
overwhelming
number
of
decisions
according
chevron
deference
have
involved
notice
and
comment
rule
making
or
adjudication,
and
while
the
fact
that
the
tariff
classification
at
issue
was
not
a
product
of
such
formal
process
does
not
alone
bar
chevron
application.
there
are
ample
reasons
to
deny
chevron
deference
here.
there
is
no
indication
on
the
statute’s
face
that
congress
meant
to
delegate
authority
to
customs
to
issue
classification
rulings
with
the
force
of
law,
and
it
is
difficult
to
see
in
agency
practice
itself
any
indication
that
customs
set
out
even
to
make
a
lawmaking
pretense
for
these
ruling
classification
letters.
for
they
are
not
generally
derived
after
notice
and
comment,
their
binding
character
stop
short
of
third
parties
and
they
are
churned
out
at
a
rate
of
at
least
10,000
a
year
in
46
different
offices
across
the
country.
none
of
this
necessarily
means
however,
that
the
letters
will
not
do
any
deference
at
all.
under
skidmore
and
swift,
an
agency’s
interpretation
may
warrant
some
deference
whatever
its
form.
thus,
the
classification
ruling
here
may
at
least
seek
a
respect
proportional
to
its
power
to
persuade.
because
that
assessment
is
not
made
in
the
first
instance
by
this
court,
we
remand
for
that
assessment.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
