justice

scalia
it
was
dictum
in
christiansen
anyway,
wasn't
it?
didn't
the
court
find
that
it
wasn't
a
reasonable
interpretation?
justice
antonin
scalia
can't
you
appeal
that
within
the
agency?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
have
to
appeal
it
within
the
agency
before
you
go
to
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you'd
say
that
any
ruling
by
the
headquarters
either
on
review
or
as
an
original
matter
is
entitled
to
chevron
deference.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
the
rulings
that
come
out
of
the
field
and
are
not
reviewed.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
i
mean,
if
it
comes
out
of
headquarters
it's
obviously
been
considered
at
a
high
level
within
the
agency
and
they
say,
this
is
the
answer.
why
should--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
but
i
mean,
if
we're
going
to
use
that
criteria...
you
see,
i
thought
chevron
was
just,
if
it's
an
authoritative
agency
position
we
defer
to
it,
but
if
you're
going
to
hang
qualifications
on
that,
that
is,
it
has
to
be
an
authoritative
agency
position
that
is
explicated
in
written
opinion,
you
might
as
well
add
the
fillips
that
your
brother
suggests,
which
is
only
those
rulings
that
are
the
product
of
formal
rulemaking.
the
one
is
as
logical
to
me
as
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
have
we
addressed
this
issue
post-chevron?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
going
to
finish
your
answer
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
then
i
have
a
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jones--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
wouldn't
a
judgment
that's
made
in
the
field,
that
isn't
appealed,
but
once
it
gets
into
court,
presumably
the
agency
at
a
high
level
decides
that
this
ruling,
made
out
in
the
field,
ought
to
be
defended
in
court,
why
doesn't
that
represent
an
official
agency
endorsement
of
that
position
made
in
the
field?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean,
of
4820?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
but
that's
all
that
we're
talking
about.
i
mean,
that's...
in
applying
that
to
any
other
importer,
surely
you
anticipated
that
the
agency
would
take
the
same
position.
the
agency
can't
say
for
one
importer
it...
you
know,
a
ring
binder
is
okay,
for
another
importer
it
isn't.
i
mean,
once
they
make
that
ruling,
don't
you
know
that
the
agency
has
taken
that
position
of
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
surely
it
means
similar
relevant
circumstances.
you...
they
can
say,
you
know,
you
have
blond
hair
and
the
other
guy
had
brown
hair.
you
think
that
they'd
say,
not
similar
circumstances?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand.
what
is
the
criterion
for
just
saying
we're
going
to
give
deference
to,
you
know,
formerly
adopted
regulations?
i
can
understand
a
criterion
that
tries
to
assess
whether
the
agency's
view
that
has
been
expressed
is
authoritative,
but
surely
the
agency's
view
on
this
issue
has
been
authoritatively
expressed
in
this
case
by
the
solicitor
general.
i
mean,
we
know
that
the
agency
believes
that
this
is
what
the
law
says.
now,
why
should
we
give
one
sort
of
deference
if
the
agency
tells
us
that
in
a
regulation
with
notice
and
comment
and
another
kind
of
deference
if
it
comes
to
us
in
some
other
fashion?
so
long
as
it's
the
agency's
authoritative
view,
what
difference
should
it
make?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
gee,
i
don't
think
that...
you
say,
was
based
on
lexicographic
sources.
i
assume
he's
talking
about
dictionaries.
now,
i
guess
you
can
say
it
is
a
question
of
fact
whether
dictionaries
say
this
or
that.
i
mean,
everything
in
the
world
is
a
question
of
fact,
but
when
we
issue
a
ruling
on
a
point
of
law
that
relies
in
part
on
dictionaries,
i
don't
consider
that
a
mixed...
a
ruling
on
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law,
did
the
dictionary
say
this
and
is
it
accurate
that
that
produces
this
result.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
other
one
is
extrinsic
evidence
of
how
these
types
of
articles
are
treated
in
the
trade
and
commerce
of
the
united
states.
i
mean,
i
don't...
you
know,
if
that
is
a
factual
question,
it
is
a
factual
question
of
the
generic
type
that
we
usually
subsume
under
the
term
of
judicial
notice.
i
mean,
what
do
people
usually
think
of
diaries
as?
you
can
call
that
a
question
of
fact,
if
you
like,
but
my
goodness,
i
think
that's
still
a
legal
determination.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that's
a
different
point
that
you
should
be
arguing,
then,
not
that
all
these
rulings
are
not
entitled
to
deference,
but
rather
that
the
ruling
in
this
case
is
not
a
ruling
purely
of
law,
but
it
involves
factual
matters
and
therefore
should
get,
indeed,
de
novo
review
if
it
went
to
the
court
of
international
trade.
