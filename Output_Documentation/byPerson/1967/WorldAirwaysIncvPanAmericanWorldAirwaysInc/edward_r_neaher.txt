mr.
edward
r.
neaher
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
arguments,
a
counsel
for
the
board
and
for
the
supplementals
that
what
they
are
trying
to
say
is
that
the
bill
on
its
face
and
these
committee
reports
clearly
support
the
board's
authority
to
permit
or
authorize
these
inclusive
tours.
and
for
that
reason,
they
say,
you
should
pay
no
attention
to
what
was
said
in
the
debates.
that
was
essentially,
i
would
say
from
my
reading
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit's
opinion,
the
basis
on
which
that
court
proceeded
to
arrive
at
a
different
result
than
did
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
that
the
bill
and
the
reports
were
clear
on
their
face
in
favor
of
this.
we
analyzed
the
bill
and
we
analyzed
those
reports,
and
we
can
reach
a
very
contrary
conclusion
for
these
reasons.
take
the
bill
on
its
face.
it
makes
no
mention
of
inclusive
tours
at
all.
it
speaks
of
chartered
trips,
a
term
not
otherwise
defined.
but
the
purpose
of
the
bill
was
to
create
for
the
first
time,
a
lawful
basis
for
the
operation
of
what
has
now
come
to
be
known
as
supplemental
air
carriers.
and
supplemental
air
carriers
were
to
engage
in
supplemental
air
transportation.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
the
only
authority
if
you
can
call
it
that
is
the
fact
that
ever
since
the
act
was
adopted
in
1938.
there
has
been
a
provision
known
as
401
(e)
which
said
that
certificated
carriers
under
the
act
could
under
regulations
of
the
board
engage
in
off
route,
chartered
trips
and
other
special
services.
i
think
the
court
is
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
1938
act
set
up
an
aviation
system
in
this
country,
founded
on
the
principle
that
all
air
carriers
engaged
in
common
transportation,
common
carriage
would
be
certificated,
and
this
with
designed
routes,
fair
structures
and
so
forth.
charter
operations
were
something
aside
from
scheduled
transportation.
and
what
congress
wanted
to
make
clear
was
that
it
would
recognize
the
right
of
a
certificated
carrier
to
depart
from
its
route
services
and
engage
in
a
form
of
charter
transportation
or
other
special
services
without
being
in
violation
of
the
act
so
long
as
what
was
done
was
done
for
pursuant
of
board
regulation
--
(voice
overlap).
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
no,
mr.
justice,
we
say
it
does
not.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
only
the
1962
act.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
yes,
the
1962
act
as
amended
--
yes,
i'm
a
little
confused
here.
the
only
provision
in
the
1962
act
says
this,
?
supplemental
air
transportation
means
charter
trips
in
air
transportation
other
than
the
transportation
mail
by
aircraft
rendered
pursuant
to
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
issued
pursuant
to
section
401(b)(3)
of
this
act
to
supplement
the
scheduled
service
authorized
by
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
issued
pursuant
to
sections
401.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
will
try
to
answer
it
in
this
manner.
first,
one
has
to
bear
in
mind
that
only
the
certificated
carriers
enjoy
the
privilege
of
individually
soliciting
and
ticketing
members
of
the
public
for
air
transportation.
secondly,
the
supplemental
carrier
so-called
before
they
became
such
--
were
known
as
non-scheds
and
regulars,
never
had
that
authority
at
all
from
1938
up
to
62.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well
the
term
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
i
think
the
most
direct
answer
i
can
give
mr.
justice
is
this
--
right
up
to
this
very
moment,
charter
trips
under
section
401(e)
off
route
does
not
include
the
right
to
individually
solicit
even
for
the
certificated
carriers
does
not
include
the
right
to
individually
solicit
or
ticket
the
general
public.
historically
in
air
transportation,
the
term
charter
had
a
well
understood
meaning.
it
meant
not
simply
the
lease
of
an
aircraft
for
air
transportation
purposes,
but
it
meant
that
when
the
so-called
chartered
aircraft
was
used
for
charter
purposes,
excluded
was
any
patronage
for
that
charter
being
derived
from
solicitation
of
the
general
public
in
individual
ticketing
of
the
general
public
or
the
use
of
travel
agents
to
fill
that
airplane.
charter
groups
were
not
groups
formed
for
travel.
they
had
to
be
groups
that
preexisted
that
utilized
the
aircraft
in
effect
as
a
charter
it
does
for
its
own
purposes
and
not
as
is
done
here
by
a
travel
agent
who
in
turn
walks
right
outside
and
says,
i
have
an
airplane.
you
buy
a
ticket
for
me
and
fill
that
airplane.
that
is
not
charter.
that
concept
of
charter
would
practically
destroy
charter
as
a
legal
concept
in
air
transportation
because
it
would
mean
that
supplemental
air
carriers
would
enjoy
the
very
same
individual
ticketing
privilege
of
the
general
public
that
only
the
certificated
carriers
are
supposed
to
have
under
their
certificates
which
incidentally
supplementals
could
have
if
they
wanted
to
apply
for
certificates
and
were
prepared
to
assume
the
financial
burdens
as
well
as
the
benefits
of
that
kind
of
certification.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
mr.
justice,
that's
an
interesting
comment
because
we
think
they
would
not
take
that
position
and
we
think
it's
strange
that
they
do
not.
we
would
think
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
i
wanted
to
say
that
in
the
supplementals
brief
to
the
court
below,
they
attached
their
brief
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
and
in
that
brief,
they
make
this
statement.
the
supplemental
airline
may
hold
out
nothing
--
no.
thus
a
supplemental
airline
may
not
offer
to
sell
individual
transportation
to
anyone
anywhere.
and
that's
what
we
say
is
what
is
wrong
with
inclusive
tours.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
other
than
board
regulations
which
now
exist
which
do
not
provide
for
that,
the
board
regulations
adopted
under
this
authority
provide
only
that
tour
operators
in
conjunction
with
the
supplemental
air
carriers
may
do
this
soliciting
and
ticketing
even
though
the
tickets
they
do
issue
to
the
public
are
tickets
of
these
supplemental
carriers
and
it's
the
carriers
who
control
the
plane
and
whose
personnel
fly
that
plane.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
they
certainly
could,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
they
could
do
a
lot.
yes,
indeed.
these
inclusive
tours
as
it
is
made
clear
in
our
brief
by
the
way
is
sometimes
used
interchangeably
with
the
time
all
expense
paid
tour.
the
inclusive
tour
is
something
considerably
less
than
that
we
believe.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
on
an
individually
ticketed
basis,
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
oh
no!
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
no,
your
honor,
i
certainly
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honor,
i
had
right
here
at
the
head
of
my
notes
to
point
out
at
the
outset
that
although
it
is
twa,
pan
america,
and
american
who
are
opposing
what
the
board
has
done
here,
i
do
want
to
make
it
clear
that
we
are
not
trying
to
undermine
the
economic
stability
of
these
supplementals
and
foreclose
them
from
the
chart
of
business
at
all.
we
are
talking
about
what
i
would
call
five
little
words,
five
little
words
in
parenthesis,
inserted
in
their
certificates
along
with
the
general
grant
of
charter
authority,
these
five
words
saying
including
inclusive
tour
charter.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
right,
right.
but
they
say
--
the
board
says
in
accepted
meaning,
what
we
say
simply
means
individually
ticketed
travel
which
violates
the
basic
structure
of
this
1962
act
which
congress
meticulously
worked
out
if
that
act
was
the
handy
work
of
primarily
the
house
committee
headed
up
by
chairman
harris.
the
board
had
submitted
a
bill.
the
supplementals
had
submitted
the
bill.
the
senate
worked
on
a
bill.
the
bill
that
emerged
from
the
conference
committee
was
the
house
bill.
and
i
want
to
point
out
one
significant
statement
since
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
the
bill
on
its
face
and
whether
these
committee
reports
do
support
the
position
of
the
board.
the
committee
report
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
believe
so
to
this
extent.
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
mechanics
when
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
it
would
not
--
in
other
words,
it
would
not
be
(voice
overlap)
it
would
be
to
members
of
the
elks.
i'm
distinguishing
the
general
public
at
large
from
the
membership
of
organizations
which
represent
the
normal
and
usual
type
of
charter
activity.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
oh
no!
not
with
individual
--
i'm
sorry
i
misunderstood.
not
with
individual
members
of
those
organizations
but
with
the
organization.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that
is
right.
it
could
make
--
it
could
make
the
same
deal
with
general
motors
operating
to
give
its
distributors
or
its
employees
an
all
expense
tours
as
a
reward
or
a
bonus
or
something
like
that.
the
essential
objective
of
congress
in
the
1962
legislation
was
to
sharply
differentiate
between
supplemental
air
transportation
defined
as
charter
trips
on
the
one
hand
and
individually
ticketed
services
on
the
other.
now
throughout
here,
the
government
and
the
supplementals
have
tried
to
give
individually
ticketed
services,
some
sort
of
a
special
meaning,
meaning
only
point-to-point
route
type
services
so-called.
well
the
first
answer
to
that
is,
when
the
non-scheds
had
no
routes,
had
no
legitimate
authority
prior
to
1962,
they
operated
so-called
point-to-point
services
on
an
individually
ticketed
basis.
and
in
fact,
in
the
big
problem
with
the
non-scheds
that
was
dealt
within
this
legislation
was
the
problem
of
trying
to
keep
the
supplementals
from
transporting
people
with
such
frequency
and
regularity
often
through
pooling
their
separate
flights
and
the
like.
that
their
charter
operations
were
counted
along
with
their
so-called
individually
ticketed
operations
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
were
evading
the
statutory
prohibition
against
such
regularity
and
so
forth
as
to
demand
that
they'd
be
fully
certificated
under
section
401.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that
is
right.
the
overall
purpose
of
the
statute,
we
say
that
congress
had
a
definite
objective
in
mind
which
was
to
keep
the
supplementals
away
from
direct
approach
and
by
direct,
i
also
mean
through
travel
agents,
directly
offering
services
to
the
general
public
as
distinguished
from
charterable
groups.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
can
only
say
that
i
know
from
the
legislative
history
that
that
was
the
fear
of
congress.
that
congress
recognized
that
for
some
ever
since
world
war
ii,
when
large
aircraft
after
the
war
came
into
use
large
aircraft
and
trained
flight
personnel.
that
it
was
no
longer
dealing
with
these
small
air
carriers
but
it
was
dealing
with
the
new
potent
group
of
air
carriers
who
were
not
certificated
and
who
through
one
device
or
another
were
encroaching
on
the
certificated
carriers
operations
whether
by
charter
or
by
individual
ticketing.
as
these
supplementals
however
went
along
through
the
50s,
their
charter
operations
became
of
more
importance
to
them
largely
because
first
of
all,
they
were
charter
operators
for
the
government,
for
the
military.
they
also
carried
organization
and
so
forth,
all
of
this
it
is
true
under
regulations,
devised
by
the
board
not
so
much
to
define
charter
trips
but
to
see
to
it
that
they
didn't
encroach
on
the
certificated
carriers'
routes
and
invade
their
markets
of
individually
ticketing
and
so
forth.
the
board
made
various
attempts
however
because
of
the
enforcement
problems.
first,
to
give
them
an
exemption
authority,
that
was
declared
illegal
by
the
court
in
1956.
then
it
worked
on
the
matter
a
little
while
longer
and
then
came
up
with
a
limited
certificate
authority.
that
was
declared
illegal
by
the
court
in
1959.
so
when
the
supplementals
talk
about
a
preexisting
authority
of
the
board
to
deal
with
this
problem,
they
are
talking
about
a
nonexistent
authority.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
if
that
ski
club
qualifies
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
if
the
ski
club
qualifies
under
the
existing
board
regulations
as
a
charterable
group,
there's
absolutely
no
question
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
oh
yes,
very
detailed
regulation.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
any
group
that
has
preexisted
that
isn't
formed
for
the
purpose
of
the
travel.
that's
where
the
rub
is.
a
group
formed
for
the
purpose
of
the
travel
is
not
really
a
bona
fide
group.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
right.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
so
have
i
your
honor.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well
if
you're
a
member
of
the
organization?
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
would
have
a
little
difficulty
if
you
weren't
a
member
of
the
organization.
after
all
the
city
bar
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
yeah,
just
the
lawyer.
i
don't
see
how
that
could
be
legitimate
because
i
would
think
that
your
only
affinity
or
relationship
with
the
group
would
be
simply
to
go
on
the
trip.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
but
for
instance
the
association
of
the
bar
in
new
york
city
frequently
each
year,
charters
a
trip.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that
is
right.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that's
right.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
the
opening
up
of
the
public
at
large
to
the
solicitation
and
ticketing
activities
of
the
supplemental,
we
say
such
transportation
is
not
supplemental
to
the
transportation
of
the
certificated
services.
it
is
not
supplemental.
it's
substitutional.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
those
are
the
words
of
the
statute,
yes.
and
your
question,
sir,
i
didn't
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
we
say
they
mean
this.
this
is
chairman
harris
giving
his
definition
of
charter
in
air
transportation.
the
law
and
i
quote
this.
it's
in
our
brief.
the
law
is
well
established
that
in
air
transportation
charter
means
essentially
the
lease
of
the
entire
capacity
of
an
aircraft
for
a
period
of
time
or
a
particular
trip
for
the
transportation
of
cargo
or
persons
and
baggage
on
a
basis
which
does
not
include
solicitation
of
the
general
public
or
any
device
where
individually
ticketed
services
would
be
offered
or
performed
under
the
guise
of
charter.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
do
on
the
theory
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that
is
the
fundamental
vital
difference
that
the
certificated
carriers
serve
the
general
public
at
large
and
are
alone
permitted
to
individually
solicit
and
ticket
those
people
for
carriage
on
their
airplanes.
the
supplemental
carriers
have
been
given
another
backyard.
that
backyard
is
the
field
of
charter
trips
only
which
throughout
the
whole
period
until
these
orders
came
down
never
meant
other
than
charter
of
a
group,
and
to
this
day,
it
still
mean
as
far
as
the
certificated
carriers
are
concerned
precisely
that
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
in
what
respect?
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
said
if
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
they
said
that
they
charter
it
to
the
elks
or
the
masons
or
anyone
mr.
justice
harlan,
under
board
regulations,
if
there
is
a
preexisting
group
which
qualifies
for
charter
transportation.
i
don't
care
what
name
you
give
it
for
what
purpose
it
is
formed.
i'm
not
saying
that
only
commercial
organizations
or
military
organizations
make
charter
planes.
social
organizations
may
and
do.
the
general
motors
does.
i
suppose
the
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
perhaps
the
most
graphic
illustration
of
this
is
found
in
the
advertising
of
the
--
one
of
the
supplemental
carriers
which
we
have
included
in
this
appendices
to
our
brief.
this
is
an
ad
which
appeared
in
the
new
york
times
magazine
in
december
about
renting
a
plane.
and
it
says,
--
it's
simple.
we
rent
our
planes
directly
through
travel
agents
to
fraternal
and
social
clubs
for
business
organizations
just
about
everybody
belongs
to
some
organizations
like
rotary
or
the
ladies
auxiliary
or
a
ski
club
or
professional
association.
any
group
like
these
can
use
rental
planes
to
get
to
conventions
or
vacations
--
these
(affinity
charter),
now
that
term
is
derived
from
board
regulations
which
speak
about
a
group
being
bona
fide
on
an
affinity
basis.
the
people
are
united
in
a
common
enjoyment,
a
common
pursue,
common
pleasure,
you
name
it,
that's
bona
fide.
we're
not
trying
to
cut
that
out.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
we
do
not.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
the
court
of
appeals
focused
on
the
individual
ticketing
aspect
in
its
opinion
and
i
remember
this,
it
is
clear,
it
was
speaking
about
the
split
charter
problem
which
came
up
as
to
whether
the
plane
in
effect
would
be
divided
among
two
groups
rather
than
one
group.
it
is
clear
that
the
fact
that
the
board
has
the
power
to
define
charter
to
include
split
charters
siding
this
case
in
348
f.2d,
a
device
permitting
the
masons
and
elks
each
to
charter
one
half
of
the
capacity
of
an
aircraft,
does
not
mean
that
the
board
is
free
to
adopt
a
definition
that
contravenes
basic
policies
laid
down
in
the
act,
to
permit
the
selling
of
individual
tickets
to
the
general
public
in
direct
competition
with
the
regularly
scheduled
airlines
regardless
of
whether
such
selling
is
done
through
the
medium
of
a
travel
agent
who
has
first
chartered
the
plane
does
violate
basic
policies
of
the
act.
that
is
the
narrow
issue
here,
your
honors.
just
those
five
little
words
including
inclusive
tour
charter
authority.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well
if
they
want
to
unite
on
a
split
charter,
i'm
sure
we
couldn't
object
to
that.
i
would
expect
that
in
these
days
of
ecumenicism
people
should
get
together.
but
that,
i
think
the
issue
has
been
focused
upon
here
that
the
basic
evil
which
congress
was
well
aware
of
here
was
the
past
difficulties
that
the
board
itself
have
to
had
in
endeavoring
to
enforce
the
act
against
the
large
and
i
think
affluent
group
of
un-certificated
carriers
who
were
continually
doing
what
they
could
to
siphon
off
passengers,
individual
passengers
from
the
certificated
airlines.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
after
it
had
already
formed
the
group?
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
in
my
judgment
that
group
would
not
under
board
regulations
qualify
as
a
group
that
would
be
bona
fide.
in
other
words,
it
would
have
been
a
group
formed
for
travel.
we
are
talking
about
here
about
groups
in
terms
of
groups
that
are
groups
not
formed
for
travel
although
they
are
free
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that's
right.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
formed
for
travel
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
oh
no,
i
don't
think
it
does.
i
think
anyone
can
form
a
group
for
any
purpose
today
so
long
as
the
precise
specific
purpose
of
the
formation
is
not
in
effect
to
form
a
group
to
take
a
charter.
you
can
form
a
group
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
the
only
answer
i
can
give
is,
if
they
have
actually
formed
that
group
and
it
is
a
bona
fide
group
under
the
board
of
regulations,
they
maybe
eligible
to
workout
a
charter
arrangement.
we
are
not
trying
to
bar
the
groups
that
are
formed
without
being
formed
specifically
for
the
purpose
of
traveling
on
a
particular
charter
or
bit
of
transportation.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
thank
you.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
mr.
neaher.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
in
response
to
questions.
i
touched
only
briefly
on
the
background
relevant
to
an
understanding
of
the
terms
used
in
the
1962
amendment.
that
background
makes
it
clears
that
all
expense
or
package
tours
or
what
the
board
now
designates
as
inclusive
tours,
were
never
operated
in
the
past
as
charter
trips.
no
carry,
whether
certificated
or
un-certificated,
would
have
been
able
to
do
that
because
all
what
prohibited
from
conducting
such
tours,
if
you
can
call
them
that
as
charter
trips.
the
certificated
carriers
conducted
tours
of
that
type
not
under
any
charter
authority
at
all,
but
under
their
individually
certificated
authority.
now
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
under
the
civil
aeronautic
acts
in
1938,
the
certificated
carriers
were
given
the
broadest
possible
scope
of
authority.
air
transportation
was
defined
as
virtually
everything
subject
to
the
regulations
of
the
board.
it
included
individual
ticketing.
it
included
charter
services.
it
included
so
called
special
services.
now
why
was
there
a
section
40
(e)
to
which
i
referred
to
yesterday.
section
40
(e)
was
concerned
only
with
activities
of
certificated
carriers
off
their
routes.
on
their
routes
they
could
sell
tours
as
part
of
their
individually
ticketed
services,
when
i
say
tours
i
mean
what
we
then
call
all
expense
package
tours.
off
their
routes
they
could
perform
charter
trips
and
it
was
in
that
connection
as
charter
trips
or
special
services
that
you
found
a
grate
many
board
regulations
designed
to
make
sure
that
charter
trips
were
not
used
to
infringe
upon
individually
ticketed
services
off
route
of
other
carriers.
now
the
boards
own
regulation
as
i
say
for
almost
three
decades
have
recognized
that
basic
distinction
between
the
individually
ticketed
type
of
travel
and
the
charter
type
of
travel
which
did
not
involve
directly
or
indirectly
the
solicitation
of
individual
members
of
the
public,
or
the
individual
ticketing
of
members
of
the
public,
or
the
use
of
travel
agents
to
sell
to
the
public
for
the
purpose
of
providing
the
patronage
for
charters.
now
everybody
agrees
here
i
believe
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
1962
amendment
was
to
confine
the
supplemental
carriers,
hereafter
from
that
point
forward
to
charter
operations
exclusively
and
to
keep
them
away
from
individually
ticketed
services.
as
the
conference
committee
report
pointed
out
when
it
was
talking
about
the
bill
which
became
law,
it
said
that
under
the
house
bill
the
term,
and
i'm
reading
from
page
199
(b)
of
the
petitioner's
of
appendix,
the
legislative
materials
appendix.
under
the
house
amendments
the
house
bill
the
term
“supplemental
air
transportation”
did
not
include
individually
ticketed
and
way
bill
services.
therefore
supplemental
air
carriers
could
not
have
had
engaged
in
such
services
on
a
permanent
basis.
the
substitute
agreed
to
in
conference
adopts
the
provisions
of
the
house
amendment
with
respect
to
the
prohibition
of
individually
ticketed
and
way
bill
services
on
a
permanent
basis.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
the
senate
bill
as
its
pointed
out
here
would
have
included
such
services
and
those
supplemental
carriers
under
the
senate
bill
could
have
engaged
in
individually
ticketed
services
but
the
senate
bill
was
rejected.
now
in
a
reply
brief
the
petitioner,
american
society
of
travel
agents
asta,
while
freely
considering
--
conceding
that
the
supplemental
could
work
prohibited
from
engaging
in
individually
ticketed
services,
attempts
to
put
a
gloss
on
what
individually
ticketed
services
means.
it
refers
to
them
as
so
called
point
to
point
services.
that's
essentially
its
principle
contagion
that
individually
ticketed
services
as
prohibited
to
the
supplemental
carriers
only
meant
that
narrow
area.
well
in
the
first
place
the
statute
on
its
face
says
nothing
about
point
to
point.
it
does
say
that
charter
trips
are
to
be
supplemental
to
the
schedule
services
of
the
certificated
carriers.
obviously
that
in
it
self
implies
that
there
is
a
limitation
on
the
charter
trips,
not
all
charter
trips
but
only
those
that
are
supplemental
to
the
scheduled
services.
it
says
nothing
about
limiting
the
scheduled
services
to
such
a
thing
as
point
to
point
individually
ticketed.
i
might
say
that
argument
was
advanced
by
the
board
yesterday
i
believe,
and
also
by
the
supplemental.
but
the
point
of
it
is
that
the
statute
on
its
face
makes
no
such
distinction
within
the
area
of
individually
ticketed
services.
individually
ticketed
services
are
historically
services
that
mean
you
go
out
to
the
general
public
at
large
and
you
solicit
individual
members
of
the
general
public
and
you
issued
tickets
to
them
as
members
of
the
general
public
and
you
do
not
treat
as
members
of
groups
of
charter
organizations
or
other
entities.
the
whole
legislative
history
of
this
bill
in
both
houses
reflects
this
clear
understanding
of
the
division
between
charter
services
on
one
--
on
the
one
hand
and
individually
ticketed
services
on
the
other.
and
it
was
only
as
mr.
justice
harlan
mentioned
when
the
senate
was
considering
what
to
do
about
this
legislation
that
the
idea
of
a
crossing
over
occurred
in
a
very
limited
context.
in
the
testimony
in
the
hearings
before
congress,
the
board
itself
told
congress
that
it
wanted
legislation
and
that
it
intended
to
preserve
the
existing
concept
of
charter
in
terms
of
the
homogeneity
of
the
charter
group
that
it
was
definitely
opposed
to
the
idea
that
travel
agents
would
be
permitted
as
principles
to
charter
aircraft
and
turn
around
and
fill
the
air
craft
buy
selling
directly
to
the
general
public.
in
the
first
print
of
the
senate
bill
there
was
no
such
exception.
it
crept
in,
in
later
prints
of
the
second
bill
of
the
senate
bill
and
it
was
limited
to
the
idea
of
all
expense
tours
by
groups.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
the
conference
committee.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
the
final
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
--
formulation
of
the
bill
that
became
the
1962
amendments,
page
199
(b)
of
the
appendix.
the
senate
as
i
say
did
adopt
this
exception
which
is
recognized
as
an
exception.
let
me
turn
to
page
31
of
our
brief.
senator
cotton,
who
is
one
of
the
managers
of
the
bill
on
the
senate
side,
pointed
out
“i
do
wish
to
comment
briefly
on
one
aspect
of
the
conference
committee's
action.
the
conferees
agreed
to
drop
the
language
in
the
senate
bill
which
defined
charter
services
and
committed
the
sale
of
tickets
on
charter
flights
to
individual
members
of
the
general
public
who
are
on
all
expense
paid
tours.
i
am
wholly
in
accord
with
the
action
in
eliminating
the
all
expense
tour
provision
and
thus
refusing
to
confirm
this
power
on
the
board.”
now
for
us
to
say
that
individually
ticketed
was
something
wholly
divorced
from
the
concept
of
charter
services
in
this
context
is
completely
refuted
by
one
of
the
senate
managers
understanding.
the
two
were
considered
in
relationship
to
one
another
and
the
whole
purpose
in
dropping
what
the
senate
proposed
to
do
was
to
preserve
what
all
the
courts
below
agreed
was
the
primary
purposed
of
this
bill.
to
preserve
the
distinction
between
individually
ticketed
travel
on
the
one
hand,
and
charter
route
travel
on
the
other.
and
that
is
why
we
say
that
what
the
board
is
done
here
with
its
present
attempt
to
bring
inclusive
tours
under
charter
trips
is
to
break
down
that
wall
of
separation.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
would
like
to
say
that
of
course
as
i
think
i
mentioned
yesterday.
it
is
not
a
question
a
attempting
to
undermine
the
economic
stability
of
the
supplementals
at
all.
the
supplemental
have
a
broad
area
of
charter
operation
which
are
right
or
which
is
right
for
the
development
and
very
fertile.
as
was
pointed
out
at
the
end
to
day
our
society
has
the
group
complex.
we
organize
ourselves
into
groups
of
all
kinds
social,
civic
and
what
not.
we
the
respondents
here
are
not
attempting
to
say
that
under
the
charter
operations
the
supplemental
are
not
free
to
exploit
that
field
to
the
full.
what
we
are
trying
to
say
is
and
what
the
policy
basic
policy
consideration
is
this.
for
some
30
years
congress
recognized
that
the
board
was
ineffective
in
its
efforts
to
keep
un-certificated
carriers
away
from
certificated
individual
ticketing
business.
the
board
through
various
regulations
that
adopted
tried
to
keep
the
so
called
irregular
carriers
from
constantly
figuring
out
camouflages
by
which
they
could
convert
their
charter
type
operations
into
an
individually
ticketed
service.
the
same
way
the
certificate
certificated
carriers
enjoyed
a
certificated
service,
because
the
basic
pattern
of
the
act
was
to
set
up
a
certificated
system
with
defined
areas
of
service
for
each
of
the
certificated
carriers.
the
irregulars
came
in
to
that
as
a
new
element
particularly
after
the
war
when
you
have
the
large
aircraft
and
the
influx
of
trained
flight
personnel.
and
the
board
was
attempting
to
cope
with
that
and
it
had
been
very
unsuccessful.
largely
because
it
attempted
to
give
them
what
might
be
called
quasi
certificates,
which
the
court
in
the
1959
case
said
“you
just
can't
do.
you
either
certificate
a
carrier
and
it
carries
with
the
all
a
consequences
of
certification,
or
you
don't
there
is
no
halfway
house.”
and
therefore
in
1962
when
congress
was
attempting
to
figure
out
with
the
board
what
the
proper
role
of
the
supplementals
was,
it
saw
readily
that
the
main
source
of
their
revenue
were
charter
operations
as
they
had
been
understood
for
some
30
years
through
charter
operations.
this
was
where
revenue
came
from.
they
had
never
really
derived
very
much
from
individual
ticketing
service,
but
they
had
been
a
headache
in
their
efforts
to
do
so.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
the
policy
decision
was
made
by
congress
when
it
said
we
will
create
this
separate
class
of
certificated
charter
carriers
limited
to
charter
operations
supplemental
to
what
the
individually
--
to
what
the
certificated
airlines
conduct
with
their
broad
grant
of
individually
ticketed
and
other
authority.
supplemental
to
that,
this
is
their
backyard.
they
are
to
keep
out
off
the
field
that
the
certificated
carriers
enjoy
under
their
broad
grants.
now
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
under
the
certification
granted
to
the
supplemental
carriers,
they
do
not
have
to
meet
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
and
the
fitness
requirements
that
the
certificated
carriers
do
because
they
do
not
purport
to
maintain
regular
service
or
have
that
equipment.
but
the
charter
field
under
the
concept
in
air
transportation
of
charter
is
wide
open
to
their
exploitation
and
in
fact
i
think
they
have
been
indicated
in
their
briefs,
they're
not
doing
too
badly
at
it
because
they
even
--
haven't
even
gotten
started
on
this
inclusive
tour
aspect
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
--
because
they
say
this
litigation
has
in
effect
hampered
that.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well
i
think
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
should
try.
our
reflection
i
think
some
clarification
maybe
necessary
because
i
believe
i
interpreted
your
honor's
question
yesterday
to
refer
to
the
background
of
charter
trips
as
it
appears
in
the
1962
amendment
with
relation
to
the
situation
before
that
amendment.
what
was
the
board's
power
or
jurisdiction
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
we
do
not
read
at
that
way
your
honor
because
we
were
pointing
out
yesterday
that
what
the
second
circuit
was
saying
the
board
did
not
have
power
to
do
was
to
permit
the
selling
of
individual
tickets
to
the
general
public
in
direct
competition
with
the
regularly
scheduled
airlines
regardless
of
whether
such
selling
is
done
through
the
medium
of
a
travel
agent
who
has
first
chartered
the
plane.
in
other
words
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that
in
the
reported
--
its
page
779
of
the
reported
opinion
and
i'll
try
to
give
you
the
record
page
number
just
a
moment.
i
wish
to
make
clear
in
response
to
you
question
mr.
justice
fortas
that
the
narrow
issue
before
the
court
of
appeals
below
was
precisely
the
question
here.
as
to
whether
these
designated
“inclusive
tours”
were
or
were
not
individually
ticketed
service
which
we
contended
may
violated
this
separation
between
individual
ticketing
and
charter
embodying
it.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
passage
to
which
i
refer
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
1135
(a),
the
last
--
beginning
at
the
last
sentence.
to
permit
the
selling
of
individual
tickets
to
the
general
public
and
i
believe
mr.
justice
that
that
is
the
key
to
the
answer
to
your
question
that
the
second
circuit
was
focusing
on
and
inclusive
tours
as
an
individually
ticketed
arrangement.
it
was
not
attempting
to
proscribe
all
expense
for
package
tour
travel
if
that
were
--
happened
to
be
a
done
on
a
charter
basis
that
is
to
say
if
the
ski
club
mentioned
here
yesterday
as
a
membership
organization
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well
i
think
it
--
alright
but
the
point
of
it
is
that
when
the
ski
club
decides
it
wants
to
go
on
some
kind
of
a
package
tour
to
rome.
it
may
freely
get
in
touch
with
a
travel
agent
indeed
to
enter
into
it
not
for
the
travel
agent
to
enter
to
the
charter
about
for
the
ski
club
to
enter
into
the
charter
with
the
supplemental.
but
it
certainly
may
use
the
services
of
the
travel
agent
to
work
out
the
arrangements
in
rome
and
sub
what.
the
second
circuit
was
not
attempting
to
prohibit
that
the
opinion
is
devoted
entirely
to
what
been
talking
about
here.
the
individual
ticketing
aspects
of
this
sprout
this,
this
graft
upon
charter,
which
is
embodied
in
this
new
design
of
the
board
that's
what
we're
complaining
about.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
if
they
went
too
far
in
what
respect?
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well
were
not
asking
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well
i
do
buy
if
you
reverse
them
i'll
start
from
that
angle.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
yes
i
think
so
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
it
was
not
my
understanding,
no
sir.
i
thought
that
everybody
was
quite
clear
that
a
narrow
issue
was
the
individually
ticketed
aspect
of
the
so
called
inclusive
tours.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
and
as
i
pointed
out
what
we
really
object
to
for
example
again
to
my
specific
illustration
of
the
advertising
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
oh
no,
no
sir
absolutely
mr.
justice
white.
we
would
not
be
able
to
uphold
that
position
at
all.
we
say
this
opinion
is
concerned
solely
with
the
inclusive
tour
and
that's
the
individual
ticketing
aspect
of
it.
now
essentially
the
board
here
in
our
view
when
it
urges
that
its
administrative
interpretation
of
this
statute
is
entitled
to
respect
a
general
principle
with
which
we
would
not
disagree,
is
in
this
case
however
asking
this
court
to
revise
what
we
say
was
a
policy
decision
made
by
congress.
that
the
board's
argument
that
it
was
left
free
by
this
house
committee
statement
report
that
we
don't
define
charter
because
the
board
is
to
have
to
continue
with
its
existing
authority
to
define
we
what
to
leave
it
flexible
and
so
forth.
was
not
a
license
to
the
board
was
not
intended
to
get
a
free
reign
to
define
charter
trips
anyway
at
pleased.
if
you
read
that
particular
section
of
the
house
report,
you
will
see
that
the
statement
in
question
is
they;
they
are
free
to
define
charter,
the
authority
is
left
with
them
subject
to
the
limitations
of
this
bill.
and
the
bill
on
its
face
shows
the
broad
limitation
that
the
supplemental
carriers
are
to
be
excluded
from
individual
ticketing
services,
because
the
bill
takes
provision
for
those
and
only
two
limited
aspects.
it
gave
him
the
two
year
face
out
of
their
former
individual
ticketing
while
they
transferred
to
all
charter
operations.
and
then
without
regard
to
supplemental
air
transportation
it
adopted
417
and
said
in
those
cases
in
the
future
where
the
public
convenient
shows
that
that
there's
a
deficiency
of
air
to
air
service
between
two
points
in
the
us
or
between
two
points
that
are
in
certified
carriers
then
they
can
come
in
and
the
board
can
give
them
temporary
operating
special
authority
for
a
maximum
of
90
days.
these
inclusive
tours
run
for
five
years
its,
its
really
individual
ticketing
on
a
permanent
basis.
contrary
to
what
congress
intended
and
we
say
that
a
board
interpretation
can
not
be
reasonably
if
it
conflicts
with
a
plainly
expressed
intent
of
congress,
even
if
you
have
to
go
to
what
was
said
by
the
managers
of
the
bill
to
find
that
intent.
we
think
that
the
court
below
was
right
when
it
said
that
it
is
foolish
for
us
not
to
look
at
what
the
managers
of
the
bill
said
on
the
floor
as
to
what
had
been
done
in
the
conference
committee.
and
that
would
be
foolish
to
disregard
senators
who
sat
with
senator
mulroney
and
said
“we
agree
with
what
was
done
here
because
we
don't
think
the
board
should
have
this
power.”
and
the
policy
decision
whether
it
be
wise
or
not
was
that
the
past
history
of
this
--
of
the
board's
inability
to
cope
with
the
various
methods
by
which
the
supplemental
carriers
invaded
individual
ticketing
justified
a
congressional
decision
to
make
the
clean
break
by
statute.
and
give
the
board
power
to
do
what
it
did
only
within
the
statutory
confines.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
because
the
certificates
are
for
five
year
--
and
for
five
years
the
certificates
granted
here
with
that
inclusive
tour.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
to
the
supplementals.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
to
the
supplemental
carrier.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
inclusive
tours
and
evolving
individually
ticketed
services
for
the
next
five
years.
and
when
i
say
the
next
starting
with
the
dates
when
they
were
issued
it's
a
five
year
period.
whereas
under
the
statute
any
individual
ticketing
authority
of
the
special
circumstances
that
i
mention
can
only
run
for
90
days.
so
i
say
on
the
face
of
the
statute
you
have
this
congressional
intent
that
charter
is
one
thing
individual
ticketing
is
another
and
they
are
precluded
from
that
field.
and
this
inclusive
tour
with
the
individual
ticketing
arrangement
is
invasion
of
what
congress
said
they
couldn't
invade.
thank
you.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
arguments,
a
counsel
for
the
board
and
for
the
supplementals
that
what
they
are
trying
to
say
is
that
the
bill
on
its
face
and
these
committee
reports
clearly
support
the
board's
authority
to
permit
or
authorize
these
inclusive
tours.
and
for
that
reason,
they
say,
you
should
pay
no
attention
to
what
was
said
in
the
debates.
that
was
essentially,
i
would
say
from
my
reading
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit's
opinion,
the
basis
on
which
that
court
proceeded
to
arrive
at
a
different
result
than
did
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
that
the
bill
and
the
reports
were
clear
on
their
face
in
favor
of
this.
we
analyzed
the
bill
and
we
analyzed
those
reports,
and
we
can
reach
a
very
contrary
conclusion
for
these
reasons.
take
the
bill
on
its
face.
it
makes
no
mention
of
inclusive
tours
at
all.
it
speaks
of
chartered
trips,
a
term
not
otherwise
defined.
but
the
purpose
of
the
bill
was
to
create
for
the
first
time,
a
lawful
basis
for
the
operation
of
what
has
now
come
to
be
known
as
supplemental
air
carriers.
and
supplemental
air
carriers
were
to
engage
in
supplemental
air
transportation.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
the
only
authority
if
you
can
call
it
that
is
the
fact
that
ever
since
the
act
was
adopted
in
1938.
there
has
been
a
provision
known
as
401
(e)
which
said
that
certificated
carriers
under
the
act
could
under
regulations
of
the
board
engage
in
off
route,
chartered
trips
and
other
special
services.
i
think
the
court
is
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
1938
act
set
up
an
aviation
system
in
this
country,
founded
on
the
principle
that
all
air
carriers
engaged
in
common
transportation,
common
carriage
would
be
certificated,
and
this
with
designed
routes,
fair
structures
and
so
forth.
charter
operations
were
something
aside
from
scheduled
transportation.
and
what
congress
wanted
to
make
clear
was
that
it
would
recognize
the
right
of
a
certificated
carrier
to
depart
from
its
route
services
and
engage
in
a
form
of
charter
transportation
or
other
special
services
without
being
in
violation
of
the
act
so
long
as
what
was
done
was
done
for
pursuant
of
board
regulation
--
(voice
overlap).
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
no,
mr.
justice,
we
say
it
does
not.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
only
the
1962
act.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
yes,
the
1962
act
as
amended
--
yes,
i'm
a
little
confused
here.
the
only
provision
in
the
1962
act
says
this,
?
supplemental
air
transportation
means
charter
trips
in
air
transportation
other
than
the
transportation
mail
by
aircraft
rendered
pursuant
to
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
issued
pursuant
to
section
401(b)(3)
of
this
act
to
supplement
the
scheduled
service
authorized
by
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
issued
pursuant
to
sections
401.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
will
try
to
answer
it
in
this
manner.
first,
one
has
to
bear
in
mind
that
only
the
certificated
carriers
enjoy
the
privilege
of
individually
soliciting
and
ticketing
members
of
the
public
for
air
transportation.
secondly,
the
supplemental
carrier
so-called
before
they
became
such
--
were
known
as
non-scheds
and
regulars,
never
had
that
authority
at
all
from
1938
up
to
62.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well
the
term
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
i
think
the
most
direct
answer
i
can
give
mr.
justice
is
this
--
right
up
to
this
very
moment,
charter
trips
under
section
401(e)
off
route
does
not
include
the
right
to
individually
solicit
even
for
the
certificated
carriers
does
not
include
the
right
to
individually
solicit
or
ticket
the
general
public.
historically
in
air
transportation,
the
term
charter
had
a
well
understood
meaning.
it
meant
not
simply
the
lease
of
an
aircraft
for
air
transportation
purposes,
but
it
meant
that
when
the
so-called
chartered
aircraft
was
used
for
charter
purposes,
excluded
was
any
patronage
for
that
charter
being
derived
from
solicitation
of
the
general
public
in
individual
ticketing
of
the
general
public
or
the
use
of
travel
agents
to
fill
that
airplane.
charter
groups
were
not
groups
formed
for
travel.
they
had
to
be
groups
that
preexisted
that
utilized
the
aircraft
in
effect
as
a
charter
it
does
for
its
own
purposes
and
not
as
is
done
here
by
a
travel
agent
who
in
turn
walks
right
outside
and
says,
i
have
an
airplane.
you
buy
a
ticket
for
me
and
fill
that
airplane.
that
is
not
charter.
that
concept
of
charter
would
practically
destroy
charter
as
a
legal
concept
in
air
transportation
because
it
would
mean
that
supplemental
air
carriers
would
enjoy
the
very
same
individual
ticketing
privilege
of
the
general
public
that
only
the
certificated
carriers
are
supposed
to
have
under
their
certificates
which
incidentally
supplementals
could
have
if
they
wanted
to
apply
for
certificates
and
were
prepared
to
assume
the
financial
burdens
as
well
as
the
benefits
of
that
kind
of
certification.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
mr.
justice,
that's
an
interesting
comment
because
we
think
they
would
not
take
that
position
and
we
think
it's
strange
that
they
do
not.
we
would
think
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
i
wanted
to
say
that
in
the
supplementals
brief
to
the
court
below,
they
attached
their
brief
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
and
in
that
brief,
they
make
this
statement.
the
supplemental
airline
may
hold
out
nothing
--
no.
thus
a
supplemental
airline
may
not
offer
to
sell
individual
transportation
to
anyone
anywhere.
and
that's
what
we
say
is
what
is
wrong
with
inclusive
tours.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
other
than
board
regulations
which
now
exist
which
do
not
provide
for
that,
the
board
regulations
adopted
under
this
authority
provide
only
that
tour
operators
in
conjunction
with
the
supplemental
air
carriers
may
do
this
soliciting
and
ticketing
even
though
the
tickets
they
do
issue
to
the
public
are
tickets
of
these
supplemental
carriers
and
it's
the
carriers
who
control
the
plane
and
whose
personnel
fly
that
plane.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
they
certainly
could,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
they
could
do
a
lot.
yes,
indeed.
these
inclusive
tours
as
it
is
made
clear
in
our
brief
by
the
way
is
sometimes
used
interchangeably
with
the
time
all
expense
paid
tour.
the
inclusive
tour
is
something
considerably
less
than
that
we
believe.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
on
an
individually
ticketed
basis,
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
oh
no!
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
no,
your
honor,
i
certainly
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honor,
i
had
right
here
at
the
head
of
my
notes
to
point
out
at
the
outset
that
although
it
is
twa,
pan
america,
and
american
who
are
opposing
what
the
board
has
done
here,
i
do
want
to
make
it
clear
that
we
are
not
trying
to
undermine
the
economic
stability
of
these
supplementals
and
foreclose
them
from
the
chart
of
business
at
all.
we
are
talking
about
what
i
would
call
five
little
words,
five
little
words
in
parenthesis,
inserted
in
their
certificates
along
with
the
general
grant
of
charter
authority,
these
five
words
saying
including
inclusive
tour
charter.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
right,
right.
but
they
say
--
the
board
says
in
accepted
meaning,
what
we
say
simply
means
individually
ticketed
travel
which
violates
the
basic
structure
of
this
1962
act
which
congress
meticulously
worked
out
if
that
act
was
the
handy
work
of
primarily
the
house
committee
headed
up
by
chairman
harris.
the
board
had
submitted
a
bill.
the
supplementals
had
submitted
the
bill.
the
senate
worked
on
a
bill.
the
bill
that
emerged
from
the
conference
committee
was
the
house
bill.
and
i
want
to
point
out
one
significant
statement
since
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
the
bill
on
its
face
and
whether
these
committee
reports
do
support
the
position
of
the
board.
the
committee
report
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
believe
so
to
this
extent.
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
mechanics
when
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
it
would
not
--
in
other
words,
it
would
not
be
(voice
overlap)
it
would
be
to
members
of
the
elks.
i'm
distinguishing
the
general
public
at
large
from
the
membership
of
organizations
which
represent
the
normal
and
usual
type
of
charter
activity.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
oh
no!
not
with
individual
--
i'm
sorry
i
misunderstood.
not
with
individual
members
of
those
organizations
but
with
the
organization.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that
is
right.
it
could
make
--
it
could
make
the
same
deal
with
general
motors
operating
to
give
its
distributors
or
its
employees
an
all
expense
tours
as
a
reward
or
a
bonus
or
something
like
that.
the
essential
objective
of
congress
in
the
1962
legislation
was
to
sharply
differentiate
between
supplemental
air
transportation
defined
as
charter
trips
on
the
one
hand
and
individually
ticketed
services
on
the
other.
now
throughout
here,
the
government
and
the
supplementals
have
tried
to
give
individually
ticketed
services,
some
sort
of
a
special
meaning,
meaning
only
point-to-point
route
type
services
so-called.
well
the
first
answer
to
that
is,
when
the
non-scheds
had
no
routes,
had
no
legitimate
authority
prior
to
1962,
they
operated
so-called
point-to-point
services
on
an
individually
ticketed
basis.
and
in
fact,
in
the
big
problem
with
the
non-scheds
that
was
dealt
within
this
legislation
was
the
problem
of
trying
to
keep
the
supplementals
from
transporting
people
with
such
frequency
and
regularity
often
through
pooling
their
separate
flights
and
the
like.
that
their
charter
operations
were
counted
along
with
their
so-called
individually
ticketed
operations
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
were
evading
the
statutory
prohibition
against
such
regularity
and
so
forth
as
to
demand
that
they'd
be
fully
certificated
under
section
401.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that
is
right.
the
overall
purpose
of
the
statute,
we
say
that
congress
had
a
definite
objective
in
mind
which
was
to
keep
the
supplementals
away
from
direct
approach
and
by
direct,
i
also
mean
through
travel
agents,
directly
offering
services
to
the
general
public
as
distinguished
from
charterable
groups.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
can
only
say
that
i
know
from
the
legislative
history
that
that
was
the
fear
of
congress.
that
congress
recognized
that
for
some
ever
since
world
war
ii,
when
large
aircraft
after
the
war
came
into
use
large
aircraft
and
trained
flight
personnel.
that
it
was
no
longer
dealing
with
these
small
air
carriers
but
it
was
dealing
with
the
new
potent
group
of
air
carriers
who
were
not
certificated
and
who
through
one
device
or
another
were
encroaching
on
the
certificated
carriers
operations
whether
by
charter
or
by
individual
ticketing.
as
these
supplementals
however
went
along
through
the
50s,
their
charter
operations
became
of
more
importance
to
them
largely
because
first
of
all,
they
were
charter
operators
for
the
government,
for
the
military.
they
also
carried
organization
and
so
forth,
all
of
this
it
is
true
under
regulations,
devised
by
the
board
not
so
much
to
define
charter
trips
but
to
see
to
it
that
they
didn't
encroach
on
the
certificated
carriers'
routes
and
invade
their
markets
of
individually
ticketing
and
so
forth.
the
board
made
various
attempts
however
because
of
the
enforcement
problems.
first,
to
give
them
an
exemption
authority,
that
was
declared
illegal
by
the
court
in
1956.
then
it
worked
on
the
matter
a
little
while
longer
and
then
came
up
with
a
limited
certificate
authority.
that
was
declared
illegal
by
the
court
in
1959.
so
when
the
supplementals
talk
about
a
preexisting
authority
of
the
board
to
deal
with
this
problem,
they
are
talking
about
a
nonexistent
authority.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
if
that
ski
club
qualifies
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
if
the
ski
club
qualifies
under
the
existing
board
regulations
as
a
charterable
group,
there's
absolutely
no
question
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
oh
yes,
very
detailed
regulation.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well,
any
group
that
has
preexisted
that
isn't
formed
for
the
purpose
of
the
travel.
that's
where
the
rub
is.
a
group
formed
for
the
purpose
of
the
travel
is
not
really
a
bona
fide
group.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
right.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
so
have
i
your
honor.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well
if
you're
a
member
of
the
organization?
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
would
have
a
little
difficulty
if
you
weren't
a
member
of
the
organization.
after
all
the
city
bar
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
yeah,
just
the
lawyer.
i
don't
see
how
that
could
be
legitimate
because
i
would
think
that
your
only
affinity
or
relationship
with
the
group
would
be
simply
to
go
on
the
trip.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
but
for
instance
the
association
of
the
bar
in
new
york
city
frequently
each
year,
charters
a
trip.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that
is
right.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that's
right.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
the
opening
up
of
the
public
at
large
to
the
solicitation
and
ticketing
activities
of
the
supplemental,
we
say
such
transportation
is
not
supplemental
to
the
transportation
of
the
certificated
services.
it
is
not
supplemental.
it's
substitutional.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
those
are
the
words
of
the
statute,
yes.
and
your
question,
sir,
i
didn't
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
we
say
they
mean
this.
this
is
chairman
harris
giving
his
definition
of
charter
in
air
transportation.
the
law
and
i
quote
this.
it's
in
our
brief.
the
law
is
well
established
that
in
air
transportation
charter
means
essentially
the
lease
of
the
entire
capacity
of
an
aircraft
for
a
period
of
time
or
a
particular
trip
for
the
transportation
of
cargo
or
persons
and
baggage
on
a
basis
which
does
not
include
solicitation
of
the
general
public
or
any
device
where
individually
ticketed
services
would
be
offered
or
performed
under
the
guise
of
charter.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
do
on
the
theory
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that
is
the
fundamental
vital
difference
that
the
certificated
carriers
serve
the
general
public
at
large
and
are
alone
permitted
to
individually
solicit
and
ticket
those
people
for
carriage
on
their
airplanes.
the
supplemental
carriers
have
been
given
another
backyard.
that
backyard
is
the
field
of
charter
trips
only
which
throughout
the
whole
period
until
these
orders
came
down
never
meant
other
than
charter
of
a
group,
and
to
this
day,
it
still
mean
as
far
as
the
certificated
carriers
are
concerned
precisely
that
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
in
what
respect?
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
said
if
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
they
said
that
they
charter
it
to
the
elks
or
the
masons
or
anyone
mr.
justice
harlan,
under
board
regulations,
if
there
is
a
preexisting
group
which
qualifies
for
charter
transportation.
i
don't
care
what
name
you
give
it
for
what
purpose
it
is
formed.
i'm
not
saying
that
only
commercial
organizations
or
military
organizations
make
charter
planes.
social
organizations
may
and
do.
the
general
motors
does.
i
suppose
the
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
perhaps
the
most
graphic
illustration
of
this
is
found
in
the
advertising
of
the
--
one
of
the
supplemental
carriers
which
we
have
included
in
this
appendices
to
our
brief.
this
is
an
ad
which
appeared
in
the
new
york
times
magazine
in
december
about
renting
a
plane.
and
it
says,
--
it's
simple.
we
rent
our
planes
directly
through
travel
agents
to
fraternal
and
social
clubs
for
business
organizations
just
about
everybody
belongs
to
some
organizations
like
rotary
or
the
ladies
auxiliary
or
a
ski
club
or
professional
association.
any
group
like
these
can
use
rental
planes
to
get
to
conventions
or
vacations
--
these
(affinity
charter),
now
that
term
is
derived
from
board
regulations
which
speak
about
a
group
being
bona
fide
on
an
affinity
basis.
the
people
are
united
in
a
common
enjoyment,
a
common
pursue,
common
pleasure,
you
name
it,
that's
bona
fide.
we're
not
trying
to
cut
that
out.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
we
do
not.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
the
court
of
appeals
focused
on
the
individual
ticketing
aspect
in
its
opinion
and
i
remember
this,
it
is
clear,
it
was
speaking
about
the
split
charter
problem
which
came
up
as
to
whether
the
plane
in
effect
would
be
divided
among
two
groups
rather
than
one
group.
it
is
clear
that
the
fact
that
the
board
has
the
power
to
define
charter
to
include
split
charters
siding
this
case
in
348
f.2d,
a
device
permitting
the
masons
and
elks
each
to
charter
one
half
of
the
capacity
of
an
aircraft,
does
not
mean
that
the
board
is
free
to
adopt
a
definition
that
contravenes
basic
policies
laid
down
in
the
act,
to
permit
the
selling
of
individual
tickets
to
the
general
public
in
direct
competition
with
the
regularly
scheduled
airlines
regardless
of
whether
such
selling
is
done
through
the
medium
of
a
travel
agent
who
has
first
chartered
the
plane
does
violate
basic
policies
of
the
act.
that
is
the
narrow
issue
here,
your
honors.
just
those
five
little
words
including
inclusive
tour
charter
authority.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well
if
they
want
to
unite
on
a
split
charter,
i'm
sure
we
couldn't
object
to
that.
i
would
expect
that
in
these
days
of
ecumenicism
people
should
get
together.
but
that,
i
think
the
issue
has
been
focused
upon
here
that
the
basic
evil
which
congress
was
well
aware
of
here
was
the
past
difficulties
that
the
board
itself
have
to
had
in
endeavoring
to
enforce
the
act
against
the
large
and
i
think
affluent
group
of
un-certificated
carriers
who
were
continually
doing
what
they
could
to
siphon
off
passengers,
individual
passengers
from
the
certificated
airlines.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
after
it
had
already
formed
the
group?
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
in
my
judgment
that
group
would
not
under
board
regulations
qualify
as
a
group
that
would
be
bona
fide.
in
other
words,
it
would
have
been
a
group
formed
for
travel.
we
are
talking
about
here
about
groups
in
terms
of
groups
that
are
groups
not
formed
for
travel
although
they
are
free
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that's
right.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
formed
for
travel
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
oh
no,
i
don't
think
it
does.
i
think
anyone
can
form
a
group
for
any
purpose
today
so
long
as
the
precise
specific
purpose
of
the
formation
is
not
in
effect
to
form
a
group
to
take
a
charter.
you
can
form
a
group
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
the
only
answer
i
can
give
is,
if
they
have
actually
formed
that
group
and
it
is
a
bona
fide
group
under
the
board
of
regulations,
they
maybe
eligible
to
workout
a
charter
arrangement.
we
are
not
trying
to
bar
the
groups
that
are
formed
without
being
formed
specifically
for
the
purpose
of
traveling
on
a
particular
charter
or
bit
of
transportation.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
thank
you.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
mr.
neaher.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
in
response
to
questions.
i
touched
only
briefly
on
the
background
relevant
to
an
understanding
of
the
terms
used
in
the
1962
amendment.
that
background
makes
it
clears
that
all
expense
or
package
tours
or
what
the
board
now
designates
as
inclusive
tours,
were
never
operated
in
the
past
as
charter
trips.
no
carry,
whether
certificated
or
un-certificated,
would
have
been
able
to
do
that
because
all
what
prohibited
from
conducting
such
tours,
if
you
can
call
them
that
as
charter
trips.
the
certificated
carriers
conducted
tours
of
that
type
not
under
any
charter
authority
at
all,
but
under
their
individually
certificated
authority.
now
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
under
the
civil
aeronautic
acts
in
1938,
the
certificated
carriers
were
given
the
broadest
possible
scope
of
authority.
air
transportation
was
defined
as
virtually
everything
subject
to
the
regulations
of
the
board.
it
included
individual
ticketing.
it
included
charter
services.
it
included
so
called
special
services.
now
why
was
there
a
section
40
(e)
to
which
i
referred
to
yesterday.
section
40
(e)
was
concerned
only
with
activities
of
certificated
carriers
off
their
routes.
on
their
routes
they
could
sell
tours
as
part
of
their
individually
ticketed
services,
when
i
say
tours
i
mean
what
we
then
call
all
expense
package
tours.
off
their
routes
they
could
perform
charter
trips
and
it
was
in
that
connection
as
charter
trips
or
special
services
that
you
found
a
grate
many
board
regulations
designed
to
make
sure
that
charter
trips
were
not
used
to
infringe
upon
individually
ticketed
services
off
route
of
other
carriers.
now
the
boards
own
regulation
as
i
say
for
almost
three
decades
have
recognized
that
basic
distinction
between
the
individually
ticketed
type
of
travel
and
the
charter
type
of
travel
which
did
not
involve
directly
or
indirectly
the
solicitation
of
individual
members
of
the
public,
or
the
individual
ticketing
of
members
of
the
public,
or
the
use
of
travel
agents
to
sell
to
the
public
for
the
purpose
of
providing
the
patronage
for
charters.
now
everybody
agrees
here
i
believe
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
1962
amendment
was
to
confine
the
supplemental
carriers,
hereafter
from
that
point
forward
to
charter
operations
exclusively
and
to
keep
them
away
from
individually
ticketed
services.
as
the
conference
committee
report
pointed
out
when
it
was
talking
about
the
bill
which
became
law,
it
said
that
under
the
house
bill
the
term,
and
i'm
reading
from
page
199
(b)
of
the
petitioner's
of
appendix,
the
legislative
materials
appendix.
under
the
house
amendments
the
house
bill
the
term
“supplemental
air
transportation”
did
not
include
individually
ticketed
and
way
bill
services.
therefore
supplemental
air
carriers
could
not
have
had
engaged
in
such
services
on
a
permanent
basis.
the
substitute
agreed
to
in
conference
adopts
the
provisions
of
the
house
amendment
with
respect
to
the
prohibition
of
individually
ticketed
and
way
bill
services
on
a
permanent
basis.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
the
senate
bill
as
its
pointed
out
here
would
have
included
such
services
and
those
supplemental
carriers
under
the
senate
bill
could
have
engaged
in
individually
ticketed
services
but
the
senate
bill
was
rejected.
now
in
a
reply
brief
the
petitioner,
american
society
of
travel
agents
asta,
while
freely
considering
--
conceding
that
the
supplemental
could
work
prohibited
from
engaging
in
individually
ticketed
services,
attempts
to
put
a
gloss
on
what
individually
ticketed
services
means.
it
refers
to
them
as
so
called
point
to
point
services.
that's
essentially
its
principle
contagion
that
individually
ticketed
services
as
prohibited
to
the
supplemental
carriers
only
meant
that
narrow
area.
well
in
the
first
place
the
statute
on
its
face
says
nothing
about
point
to
point.
it
does
say
that
charter
trips
are
to
be
supplemental
to
the
schedule
services
of
the
certificated
carriers.
obviously
that
in
it
self
implies
that
there
is
a
limitation
on
the
charter
trips,
not
all
charter
trips
but
only
those
that
are
supplemental
to
the
scheduled
services.
it
says
nothing
about
limiting
the
scheduled
services
to
such
a
thing
as
point
to
point
individually
ticketed.
i
might
say
that
argument
was
advanced
by
the
board
yesterday
i
believe,
and
also
by
the
supplemental.
but
the
point
of
it
is
that
the
statute
on
its
face
makes
no
such
distinction
within
the
area
of
individually
ticketed
services.
individually
ticketed
services
are
historically
services
that
mean
you
go
out
to
the
general
public
at
large
and
you
solicit
individual
members
of
the
general
public
and
you
issued
tickets
to
them
as
members
of
the
general
public
and
you
do
not
treat
as
members
of
groups
of
charter
organizations
or
other
entities.
the
whole
legislative
history
of
this
bill
in
both
houses
reflects
this
clear
understanding
of
the
division
between
charter
services
on
one
--
on
the
one
hand
and
individually
ticketed
services
on
the
other.
and
it
was
only
as
mr.
justice
harlan
mentioned
when
the
senate
was
considering
what
to
do
about
this
legislation
that
the
idea
of
a
crossing
over
occurred
in
a
very
limited
context.
in
the
testimony
in
the
hearings
before
congress,
the
board
itself
told
congress
that
it
wanted
legislation
and
that
it
intended
to
preserve
the
existing
concept
of
charter
in
terms
of
the
homogeneity
of
the
charter
group
that
it
was
definitely
opposed
to
the
idea
that
travel
agents
would
be
permitted
as
principles
to
charter
aircraft
and
turn
around
and
fill
the
air
craft
buy
selling
directly
to
the
general
public.
in
the
first
print
of
the
senate
bill
there
was
no
such
exception.
it
crept
in,
in
later
prints
of
the
second
bill
of
the
senate
bill
and
it
was
limited
to
the
idea
of
all
expense
tours
by
groups.

the
final
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
--
formulation
of
the
bill
that
became
the
1962
amendments,
page
199
(b)
of
the
appendix.
the
senate
as
i
say
did
adopt
this
exception
which
is
recognized
as
an
exception.
let
me
turn
to
page
31
of
our
brief.
senator
cotton,
who
is
one
of
the
managers
of
the
bill
on
the
senate
side,
pointed
out
“i
do
wish
to
comment
briefly
on
one
aspect
of
the
conference
committee's
action.
the
conferees
agreed
to
drop
the
language
in
the
senate
bill
which
defined
charter
services
and
committed
the
sale
of
tickets
on
charter
flights
to
individual
members
of
the
general
public
who
are
on
all
expense
paid
tours.
i
am
wholly
in
accord
with
the
action
in
eliminating
the
all
expense
tour
provision
and
thus
refusing
to
confirm
this
power
on
the
board.”
now
for
us
to
say
that
individually
ticketed
was
something
wholly
divorced
from
the
concept
of
charter
services
in
this
context
is
completely
refuted
by
one
of
the
senate
managers
understanding.
the
two
were
considered
in
relationship
to
one
another
and
the
whole
purpose
in
dropping
what
the
senate
proposed
to
do
was
to
preserve
what
all
the
courts
below
agreed
was
the
primary
purposed
of
this
bill.
to
preserve
the
distinction
between
individually
ticketed
travel
on
the
one
hand,
and
charter
route
travel
on
the
other.
and
that
is
why
we
say
that
what
the
board
is
done
here
with
its
present
attempt
to
bring
inclusive
tours
under
charter
trips
is
to
break
down
that
wall
of
separation.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
would
like
to
say
that
of
course
as
i
think
i
mentioned
yesterday.
it
is
not
a
question
a
attempting
to
undermine
the
economic
stability
of
the
supplementals
at
all.
the
supplemental
have
a
broad
area
of
charter
operation
which
are
right
or
which
is
right
for
the
development
and
very
fertile.
as
was
pointed
out
at
the
end
to
day
our
society
has
the
group
complex.
we
organize
ourselves
into
groups
of
all
kinds
social,
civic
and
what
not.
we
the
respondents
here
are
not
attempting
to
say
that
under
the
charter
operations
the
supplemental
are
not
free
to
exploit
that
field
to
the
full.
what
we
are
trying
to
say
is
and
what
the
policy
basic
policy
consideration
is
this.
for
some
30
years
congress
recognized
that
the
board
was
ineffective
in
its
efforts
to
keep
un-certificated
carriers
away
from
certificated
individual
ticketing
business.
the
board
through
various
regulations
that
adopted
tried
to
keep
the
so
called
irregular
carriers
from
constantly
figuring
out
camouflages
by
which
they
could
convert
their
charter
type
operations
into
an
individually
ticketed
service.
the
same
way
the
certificate
certificated
carriers
enjoyed
a
certificated
service,
because
the
basic
pattern
of
the
act
was
to
set
up
a
certificated
system
with
defined
areas
of
service
for
each
of
the
certificated
carriers.
the
irregulars
came
in
to
that
as
a
new
element
particularly
after
the
war
when
you
have
the
large
aircraft
and
the
influx
of
trained
flight
personnel.
and
the
board
was
attempting
to
cope
with
that
and
it
had
been
very
unsuccessful.
largely
because
it
attempted
to
give
them
what
might
be
called
quasi
certificates,
which
the
court
in
the
1959
case
said
“you
just
can't
do.
you
either
certificate
a
carrier
and
it
carries
with
the
all
a
consequences
of
certification,
or
you
don't
there
is
no
halfway
house.”
and
therefore
in
1962
when
congress
was
attempting
to
figure
out
with
the
board
what
the
proper
role
of
the
supplementals
was,
it
saw
readily
that
the
main
source
of
their
revenue
were
charter
operations
as
they
had
been
understood
for
some
30
years
through
charter
operations.
this
was
where
revenue
came
from.
they
had
never
really
derived
very
much
from
individual
ticketing
service,
but
they
had
been
a
headache
in
their
efforts
to
do
so.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
the
policy
decision
was
made
by
congress
when
it
said
we
will
create
this
separate
class
of
certificated
charter
carriers
limited
to
charter
operations
supplemental
to
what
the
individually
--
to
what
the
certificated
airlines
conduct
with
their
broad
grant
of
individually
ticketed
and
other
authority.
supplemental
to
that,
this
is
their
backyard.
they
are
to
keep
out
off
the
field
that
the
certificated
carriers
enjoy
under
their
broad
grants.
now
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
under
the
certification
granted
to
the
supplemental
carriers,
they
do
not
have
to
meet
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
and
the
fitness
requirements
that
the
certificated
carriers
do
because
they
do
not
purport
to
maintain
regular
service
or
have
that
equipment.
but
the
charter
field
under
the
concept
in
air
transportation
of
charter
is
wide
open
to
their
exploitation
and
in
fact
i
think
they
have
been
indicated
in
their
briefs,
they're
not
doing
too
badly
at
it
because
they
even
--
haven't
even
gotten
started
on
this
inclusive
tour
aspect
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
--
because
they
say
this
litigation
has
in
effect
hampered
that.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well
i
think
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
i
should
try.
our
reflection
i
think
some
clarification
maybe
necessary
because
i
believe
i
interpreted
your
honor's
question
yesterday
to
refer
to
the
background
of
charter
trips
as
it
appears
in
the
1962
amendment
with
relation
to
the
situation
before
that
amendment.
what
was
the
board's
power
or
jurisdiction
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
we
do
not
read
at
that
way
your
honor
because
we
were
pointing
out
yesterday
that
what
the
second
circuit
was
saying
the
board
did
not
have
power
to
do
was
to
permit
the
selling
of
individual
tickets
to
the
general
public
in
direct
competition
with
the
regularly
scheduled
airlines
regardless
of
whether
such
selling
is
done
through
the
medium
of
a
travel
agent
who
has
first
chartered
the
plane.
in
other
words
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
that
in
the
reported
--
its
page
779
of
the
reported
opinion
and
i'll
try
to
give
you
the
record
page
number
just
a
moment.
i
wish
to
make
clear
in
response
to
you
question
mr.
justice
fortas
that
the
narrow
issue
before
the
court
of
appeals
below
was
precisely
the
question
here.
as
to
whether
these
designated
“inclusive
tours”
were
or
were
not
individually
ticketed
service
which
we
contended
may
violated
this
separation
between
individual
ticketing
and
charter
embodying
it.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
passage
to
which
i
refer
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
1135
(a),
the
last
--
beginning
at
the
last
sentence.
to
permit
the
selling
of
individual
tickets
to
the
general
public
and
i
believe
mr.
justice
that
that
is
the
key
to
the
answer
to
your
question
that
the
second
circuit
was
focusing
on
and
inclusive
tours
as
an
individually
ticketed
arrangement.
it
was
not
attempting
to
proscribe
all
expense
for
package
tour
travel
if
that
were
--
happened
to
be
a
done
on
a
charter
basis
that
is
to
say
if
the
ski
club
mentioned
here
yesterday
as
a
membership
organization
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well
i
think
it
--
alright
but
the
point
of
it
is
that
when
the
ski
club
decides
it
wants
to
go
on
some
kind
of
a
package
tour
to
rome.
it
may
freely
get
in
touch
with
a
travel
agent
indeed
to
enter
into
it
not
for
the
travel
agent
to
enter
to
the
charter
about
for
the
ski
club
to
enter
into
the
charter
with
the
supplemental.
but
it
certainly
may
use
the
services
of
the
travel
agent
to
work
out
the
arrangements
in
rome
and
sub
what.
the
second
circuit
was
not
attempting
to
prohibit
that
the
opinion
is
devoted
entirely
to
what
been
talking
about
here.
the
individual
ticketing
aspects
of
this
sprout
this,
this
graft
upon
charter,
which
is
embodied
in
this
new
design
of
the
board
that's
what
we're
complaining
about.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
if
they
went
too
far
in
what
respect?
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well
were
not
asking
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
well
i
do
buy
if
you
reverse
them
i'll
start
from
that
angle.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
yes
i
think
so
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
it
was
not
my
understanding,
no
sir.
i
thought
that
everybody
was
quite
clear
that
a
narrow
issue
was
the
individually
ticketed
aspect
of
the
so
called
inclusive
tours.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
and
as
i
pointed
out
what
we
really
object
to
for
example
again
to
my
specific
illustration
of
the
advertising
--
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
oh
no,
no
sir
absolutely
mr.
justice
white.
we
would
not
be
able
to
uphold
that
position
at
all.
we
say
this
opinion
is
concerned
solely
with
the
inclusive
tour
and
that's
the
individual
ticketing
aspect
of
it.
now
essentially
the
board
here
in
our
view
when
it
urges
that
its
administrative
interpretation
of
this
statute
is
entitled
to
respect
a
general
principle
with
which
we
would
not
disagree,
is
in
this
case
however
asking
this
court
to
revise
what
we
say
was
a
policy
decision
made
by
congress.
that
the
board's
argument
that
it
was
left
free
by
this
house
committee
statement
report
that
we
don't
define
charter
because
the
board
is
to
have
to
continue
with
its
existing
authority
to
define
we
what
to
leave
it
flexible
and
so
forth.
was
not
a
license
to
the
board
was
not
intended
to
get
a
free
reign
to
define
charter
trips
anyway
at
pleased.
if
you
read
that
particular
section
of
the
house
report,
you
will
see
that
the
statement
in
question
is
they;
they
are
free
to
define
charter,
the
authority
is
left
with
them
subject
to
the
limitations
of
this
bill.
and
the
bill
on
its
face
shows
the
broad
limitation
that
the
supplemental
carriers
are
to
be
excluded
from
individual
ticketing
services,
because
the
bill
takes
provision
for
those
and
only
two
limited
aspects.
it
gave
him
the
two
year
face
out
of
their
former
individual
ticketing
while
they
transferred
to
all
charter
operations.
and
then
without
regard
to
supplemental
air
transportation
it
adopted
417
and
said
in
those
cases
in
the
future
where
the
public
convenient
shows
that
that
there's
a
deficiency
of
air
to
air
service
between
two
points
in
the
us
or
between
two
points
that
are
in
certified
carriers
then
they
can
come
in
and
the
board
can
give
them
temporary
operating
special
authority
for
a
maximum
of
90
days.
these
inclusive
tours
run
for
five
years
its,
its
really
individual
ticketing
on
a
permanent
basis.
contrary
to
what
congress
intended
and
we
say
that
a
board
interpretation
can
not
be
reasonably
if
it
conflicts
with
a
plainly
expressed
intent
of
congress,
even
if
you
have
to
go
to
what
was
said
by
the
managers
of
the
bill
to
find
that
intent.
we
think
that
the
court
below
was
right
when
it
said
that
it
is
foolish
for
us
not
to
look
at
what
the
managers
of
the
bill
said
on
the
floor
as
to
what
had
been
done
in
the
conference
committee.
and
that
would
be
foolish
to
disregard
senators
who
sat
with
senator
mulroney
and
said
“we
agree
with
what
was
done
here
because
we
don't
think
the
board
should
have
this
power.”
and
the
policy
decision
whether
it
be
wise
or
not
was
that
the
past
history
of
this
--
of
the
board's
inability
to
cope
with
the
various
methods
by
which
the
supplemental
carriers
invaded
individual
ticketing
justified
a
congressional
decision
to
make
the
clean
break
by
statute.
and
give
the
board
power
to
do
what
it
did
only
within
the
statutory
confines.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
because
the
certificates
are
for
five
year
--
and
for
five
years
the
certificates
granted
here
with
that
inclusive
tour.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
to
the
supplementals.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
to
the
supplemental
carrier.
mr.
edward
r.
neaher
inclusive
tours
and
evolving
individually
ticketed
services
for
the
next
five
years.
and
when
i
say
the
next
starting
with
the
dates
when
they
were
issued
it's
a
five
year
period.
whereas
under
the
statute
any
individual
ticketing
authority
of
the
special
circumstances
that
i
mention
can
only
run
for
90
days.
so
i
say
on
the
face
of
the
statute
you
have
this
congressional
intent
that
charter
is
one
thing
individual
ticketing
is
another
and
they
are
precluded
from
that
field.
and
this
inclusive
tour
with
the
individual
ticketing
arrangement
is
invasion
of
what
congress
said
they
couldn't
invade.
thank
you.
