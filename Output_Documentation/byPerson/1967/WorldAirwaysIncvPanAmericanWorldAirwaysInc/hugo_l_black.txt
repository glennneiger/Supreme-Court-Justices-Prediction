justice

black
may
i
ask
you
before
you
sit
down.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
is
opposed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
who's
in
favor
of
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
travel
agents
are
assumed
for
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
these
all
nonscheduled?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
carry
the
same
type
of
plane?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
i
gather
from
what
you've
said,
these
inclusive
of
charter
flights,
they
have
strong
similarities
to
the
method
of
transportation
on
boats
that
has
been
in
existence
for
a
long
period
of
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
basic
thing
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
appear
there
that
they
will
get
back
to
regular
schedule
service
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
had
some
letters
from
lawyers
association
(inaudible)
inviting
me
to
join
the
charter.
justice
hugo
l.
black
around
the
world
or
around
part
of
the
world.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
said,
since
you're
a
lawyer,
we
will
take
care
on
our
chartered
trip,
is
that
all
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'd
be
a
lawyer
but
i
wouldn't
be
a
member
of
the
local
organization
that's
getting
up
the
trip.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
is
the
lawyer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
would
be
a
part
of
it,
if
i
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
must
be
some
kind
of
an
association.
it
has
an
existence
where
it
can
decide
that
it
wants
to
take
so
many
people
in
its
organization
on
a
chartered
trip,
and
it
arranges,
and
it
can
then
make
the
arrangements.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
cannot
do
it
unless
they
are
members
of
that
organization.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
afraid
of
is
a
individual
purchase
by
the
people
who
are
going
to
travel.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
this
mean
in
the
statute?
supplemental
and
transportation
is
defined
as
charter
trips
in
air
transportation
to
supplement
scheduled
service
which
the
regular
route
service
is
authorized
to
provide,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
according
to
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
they
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
say
then
is
that
it's
all
right.
these
services
are
to
supplement
the
regular
scheduled
carriers.
it
can
only
be
done
on
a
group
basis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
difference.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
force
the
brother
rotarians
to
limit
themselves
to
brother
rotarians
or
do
you
let
them
take
in
some
coordinates?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
a
travel
agent
proceeded
in
getting
the
200
people
who
want
to
make
a
trip
to
europe
had
no
charter.
he
had
to
get
them
to
make
the
trip
to
europe
in
certain
places.
it
asks
for
a
chartered
plane,
could
he
get
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right,
already
formed
the
group.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
one
other
difference
between
that
you
say
that
they
cannot
--
if
they'd
be
a
preexisting
group,
there
must
be
a
preexisting
route?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
they
cannot
be
in
a
new
group
formed
for
travel
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
whatever
it
is
to
be
formed
if
you're
going
to
make
a
trip
because
that
binds
them
all
doesn't
it,
in
a
new
group.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
they
form
of
a
ski
group
as
my
brother
fortas
could
get
that
could
go
up
to
new
england
next
winter.
and
then
they
decide
after
that,
they
have
a
charter
plane,
can
they
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
some
of
the
tour
run
five
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
certificate
to
whom?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
the
