justice
potter
stewart
is
the
charter
that
the
agent
can
negotiate
with
the
carrier
be
limited
just
to
air
transportation?
justice
potter
stewart
whose
report
was
that?
justice
potter
stewart
who
is
the
chairman
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
who
later
remarked
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
the
record
showed
through
the
statement
something
like
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
record
doesn't
show
as
compared
to
the
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
was
this
before
this
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know.
so
is
there
any
case
which
sustains
your
statement
that
the
board
at
authority
before
these
amendments
to
include
in
a
chartered
service
all
expense
tours.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
scoutt,
mr.
harris
was
one
of
the
house
conferees?
justice
potter
stewart
doesn't
that
suggest
--
because
we
don't
have
any
conference
minutes
in
this
?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
it
is
possible,
is
it
not
--
the
views
that
were
expressed
by
those
six
will
reflect
the
discussion
that
they
had
in
the
conference?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
but
mr.
monroni
(ph)
explained
that
he
wanted
that
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
final
vote
in
both
houses
mr.
scoutt,
certainly
--
justice
potter
stewart
--the
final
vote
in
both
houses
on
this
legislation
was
taken
after
as
i
read
this
now.
conferees
on
both
sides,
six
in
the
house
and
three
as
i
think
isn't
it
(voice
overlap)
in
the
senate,
said
virtually
the
same
thing,
didn't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
ordinarily,
wouldn't
one
infer
that
the
final
votes
then
were
based
upon
that
understanding
of
what
it
was
the
houses
were
passing?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
vote
was
taken
after
the
quorum
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
feel
differently
that
they
actually
said
to
the
committee
report?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
six
people
said
normally?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
your
understanding
that
any
of
the
parties
to
this
litigation
have
any
difficulty
with
the
meaning
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
quite
a
part
from
a
charter.
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
were
talking
mr.
wozencraft
they
were
--
the
issue
before
them
was
a
charter
by
a
travel
agent.
justice
potter
stewart
who
then
sold
tickets
to
the
general
public
and
that's
all
they
were
deciding
you
agree
to
that.
justice
potter
stewart
requiring
at
least
a
110%
of
the
point
to
point
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
at
least
three
stops
and
all
the
rest
of
it
we
know
that.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
was
the
only
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
you
know
you
don't
disagree
in
other
words
with
your
brother
as
to
what
it
was
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
so.
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
charter

the
