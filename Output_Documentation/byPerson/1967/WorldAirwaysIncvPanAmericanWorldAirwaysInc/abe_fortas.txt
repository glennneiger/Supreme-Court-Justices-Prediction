justice
abe
fortas
what
does
he
include
along
with
the
air
transportation?
justice
abe
fortas
do
i
correctly
understand
you
to
say
that
the
conference
committee
adopted
that
house
committee's
report?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
you
said
that
it
adopted
the
committee
report?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
didn't
the
conference
committee
file
a
report
of
its
own?
justice
abe
fortas
it
didn't
say
anything
at
all.
justice
abe
fortas
so
what
it
did
was
to
adopt
the
house
language
but
it
did
not
include
the
language
that
you're
allowing
in
the
house
report?
justice
abe
fortas
can
i
ask
you
one
other
question.
the
scheduled
air
carriers
do
conduct
some
sort
of
--
do
advertise
some
sort
of
all
expense
tours,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
a
specific
language
in
the
act
giving
the
cab
power
to
authorize
that?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
but
is
there
any
language
in
the
civil
aeronautic
side
that
relates
to
that
activity
of
the
scheduled
carriers?
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
trips
to
which
i'm
referring
are
not
chartered
but
the
airline
does
send
you
a
package,
doesn't
it
--
(voice
overlap)
package.
justice
abe
fortas
without
--
do
they
file
tariffs
or
no
--?
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
cab
have
any
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
the
non-transportation
end
of
that
activity.
justice
abe
fortas
and
we're
talking
here
only
about
foreign.
justice
abe
fortas
this
is
--
excuse
me,
sir.
you
have
a
real
problem
here
don't
you?
the
chairman
of
the
house
committee,
page
232(b)
of
the
appendix
to
your
brief.
and
he
said,
the
senate
--
this
is
congressman
harris,
chairman
of
the
committee.
the
senate
conferees
having
receded
from
insistence
on
the
all
expense
paid
tour
exception.
now,
that's
a
flat
statement
isn't
it
by
him.
that
the
senate
conferees
receded
from
their
insistence
on
the
all
expense
paid
tour
exception.
and
it's
pretty
hard,
isn't
it
to
get
away
from
the
conclusion
that
in
the
mind
of
the
chairman
of
the
house
committee,
the
authorization
given
did
not
include
authorization
to
permit
these
all
expense
tours.
what
do
you
do
with
that
apart
from
saying
he
didn't
really
mean
it
or
it
is
the
voice
maybe
the
voice
of
--
so
on
and
so?
justice
abe
fortas
but
then
he
says
not.
he
says
that
it's
in
effect
as
i
read
this
he's
saying
that
--
or
restated,
he
is
saying?
this
bill
does
not
authorize
all
expense
tours.
then
that's
about
what
this
amounts
to
as
i
read
it.
he's
saying
that
the
bill
of
the
house
is
now
considering
after
the
conference,
does
not
authorize
the
all
expense
tours.
is
there
anyway
getting
away
from
that
really?
justice
abe
fortas
they
were
all
members
of
the
congress.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
quite
contrary
to
all
the
learnings
in
the
book
isn't
it?
it's
the
way
you
find
that
legislative
intent.
justice
abe
fortas
and
where
does
the
authority
for
scheduled
carriers
to
engage
in
all
expense
trip
activities
come
from?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
fine.
now
in
the
legislation
on
the
nonscheduled
carriers
or
supplemental
carriers
as
they're
now
called,
does
that
authorize
them
to
engage
in
charter
service?
what
is
the
precise
language?
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
the
precise
language
for
the
supplemental
carriers?
is
any
language
that's
comparable
to
the
language
you
just
read
to
me
with
respect
to
the
scheduled
carriers?
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
be
kind
enough
to
read
the
phrase.
justice
abe
fortas
then
why
isn't
the
history,
the
administrative
history
of
the
word
charter
with
respect
to
the
scheduled
carriers
pertinent
here?
that
is
to
say
if
the
word
charter
in
connection
with
scheduled
carriers
was
construed
as
years
went
by
to
permit
them
to
engage
in
the
business
of
all
expense
tours.
why
should
the
word
charter
here
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
isn't
that
relevant
to
the
construction
of
the
word
charter
as
used
in
the
62
act?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
suppose
we
get
beyond
that
point.
suppose
we
say
that
the
charter
service
being
fringed
by
the
supplemental
carriers
is
not
subject
to
condemnation
on
the
grounds
--
that
it
is
a
point-to-point
or
individually
ticketed
service.
and
then
we
get
to
the
naked
question
of
what
does
the
term
charter
mean?
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
the
question
i'm
asking
you
is
why
isn't
the
administrative,
the
practical
interpretation
of
that
word
in
the
case
of
the
certificated
carriers
relevant
to
the
interpretation
of
the
word
in
the
1962
act
with
respect
to
the
supplemental
carriers?
justice
abe
fortas
but
is
it
necessary
to
include
there,
saying
that
they
can
get
(inaudible)
certification.
justice
abe
fortas
could
that
charter
--
make
a
charter
deal
with
the
office
and
this
would
be
the
officers
you
see
for
all
expense
tour
for
100
people.
justice
abe
fortas
and
no
doubt
about
that.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
they
could
go
ahead
and
arrange
for
the
hotel
and
travel
and
visit
to
nightclubs,
they
don't
mean
that,
whatever
else
is
involved.
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
don't
really
literally
interpret
what
congressman
harris
said
on
the
floor
to
exclude
all
expense
tours,
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
justice
abe
fortas
about
his
words,
he
didn't
say
on
an
individually
ticketed
basis
or
otherwise.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
you
don't
rely
on
that.
justice
abe
fortas
could
i
put
a
case
to
you,
because
i'm
a
little
barefooted
how
anything
can
be
phrased
here
or
stated
to
carrier
on
what
you
have
in
mind,
let
me
ask
you
this.
let's
suppose
that
a
travel
agent
went
to
a
supplemental
carrier,
and
said,
i
want
to
charter
a
plane
for
all
expense
tours,
such
and
such,
and
such,
and
such
places.
and
the
supplemental
carrier
says
okay.
and
it
turns
out
that
the
travel
agent
has
raised
in
the
supplemental
tour
for
the
washington
d.c.
ski
club
which
is
composed
of
some
people
who
have
got
together
and
they
decided
that
they
make
up
to
friday
of
120
people
or
whatever
it
is
to
tour
some
skiers.
now
on
what
side
of
the
line
does
that
fall
with
respect
to
the
statutory
authorities?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
a
ski
club
and
that's
all
there
is
with
the
people
who
like
to
ski
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
do
the
regulations
now
talk
about
whose
charterable
and
who's
not?
justice
abe
fortas
is
the
ski
club
charterable?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
that's
where
you
draw
the
line.
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
agree
that
the
court
of
appeals
here
has
thrown
out
the
elks
with
the
individual
passenger.
justice
abe
fortas
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
reserves
a
possibility
that
the
supplemental
carriers
can
make
a
deal
with
the
(inaudible)
of
the
ski
club
or
so
on.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
neaher
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
neaher
i'd
like
to
make
sure
that
by
an
impression
i
got
yesterday
in
you
argument
is
what
you
meant
to
convey.
as
i
understand
your
argument
yesterday,
you're
making
a
distinction
between
all
inclusive
tours
all
expense
tours
all
inclusive
tours
on
a
charter
basis
as
you
conceive
it.
and
all
expense
tours
on
a
non-charter
basis
let
me
say
roughly
that
is
to
say
a
basis
which
is
open
to
the
charge
that
it
permits
point
to
point
or
individually
ticketed
service.
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
could
you
answer
that
as
briefly
as
you
can
because
i
have
another
question.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
we're
going
to
get
lost
here.
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
you
pardon
for
saying
that.
justice
abe
fortas
because
then
i'll
have
to
ask
you
without
your
answering
that
question
my
ultimate
question.
i
find
nothing
and
i
looked
again
after
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
see
nothing
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
which
would
permit
the
board
under
this
statutory
authority
to
authorize
the
supplemental
carriers
to
engage
in
the
business
of
selling
or
offering
charter
tours
as
you
defined
them
on
an
all
inclusive
all
expense
basis.
as
i
look
at
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
it
will
prohibit
the
board
from
offering
all
expense
tours
whether
on
a
charter
basis
or
on
any
basis.
now
i
got
the
impression
yesterday
that
you
do
not
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
way
and
i
would
appreciate
your
telling
me
why
and
if
possible
pointing
to
the
language
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
justice
abe
fortas
now
where
will
i
find
that?
justice
abe
fortas
why
for
example
i
read
the
1142
(a)
of
the
record,
court
of
appeals
opinion.
“if
as
we
hold
congress
did
not
give
the
board
power
to
authorize
inclusive
tours
it
is
immaterial
whether
as
the
board
contends
or
proposed
regulations
will
be
effective
in
curving
abuses
of
the
inclusive
tours
certificates.”
and
summing
on
that
same
effect
appears
elsewhere
in
this.
where
is
the
passage
to
which
you
refer?
justice
abe
fortas
by
me
only
i
my
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
i
think
my
brother
hadn't
concurred.
justice
abe
fortas
well
the
board's
order
expressly
says
that
doesn't
it
that
this
does
not
mean
that
the
supplemental
carriers
can
engage
in
individually
ticketed
service?
justice
abe
fortas
well
it's
at
least
arguable
i
suppose.the
difference
between
the
parties
here
between
you
and
your
colleagues
on
one
side
mr.
neaher
on
the
other
is
one
of
administration
that
is
to
say
it's
entirely
conceivable
of
course
a
charter
authority
could
be
used
as
a
subterfuge.
and
if
it
were
used
as
a
subterfuge
in
reality
to
provide
individually
ticketed
services
that
would
conflict
with
the
boards
order
as
i
read
it.
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
think
the
second
circuit
held
in
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
with
respect
to
this
matter
at
hours
discussing
with
mr.
neaher?
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
think
the
second
circuit
probably
never
reached
the
question
of
actual
group
tour
itself.
it
just
said
that
on
inclusive
tour
charters
that
they
felt
constrain
by
the
statements
on
the
floor
on
the
day
of
the
vote
to
keep
the
board
from
having
the
authority
to
issue
this
kind
of
inclusive
tour
charter
under
even
the
most
carefully
hedged
conditions.
it
was
an
absolutely
ban.
justice
abe
fortas
what
does
he
include
along
with
the
air
transportation?
justice
abe
fortas
do
i
correctly
understand
you
to
say
that
the
conference
committee
adopted
that
house
committee's
report?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
you
said
that
it
adopted
the
committee
report?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
didn't
the
conference
committee
file
a
report
of
its
own?
justice
abe
fortas
it
didn't
say
anything
at
all.
justice
abe
fortas
so
what
it
did
was
to
adopt
the
house
language
but
it
did
not
include
the
language
that
you're
allowing
in
the
house
report?
justice
abe
fortas
can
i
ask
you
one
other
question.
the
scheduled
air
carriers
do
conduct
some
sort
of
--
do
advertise
some
sort
of
all
expense

is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
a
specific
language
in
the
act
giving
the

power
to
authorize
that?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
but
is
there
any
language
in
the
civil
aeronautic
side
that
relates
to
that
activity
of
the
scheduled
carriers?
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
trips
to
which
i'm
referring
are
not
chartered
but
the
airline
does
send
you
a
package,
doesn't
it
--
(voice

package.
justice
abe
fortas
without
--
do
they
file

or
no
--?
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
cab
have
any

with
respect
to
the
non-transportation
end
of
that
activity.
justice
abe
fortas
and
we're
talking
here
only
about
foreign.
justice
abe
fortas
this
is
--
excuse

you
see
for
all
expense
tour
for
100
people.
justice
abe
fortas
and
no
doubt
about
that.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
they
could
go
ahead
and
arrange
for
the
hotel
and
travel
and
visit
to
nightclubs,
they
don't
mean
that,
whatever
else
is
involved.
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
don't
really
literally
interpret
what
congressman
harris
said
on
the
floor
to
exclude
all
expense
tours,
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
justice
abe
fortas
about
his
words,
he
didn't
say
on
an
individually
ticketed
basis
or
otherwise.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
you
don't
rely
on
that.
justice
abe
fortas
could
i
put
a
case
to
you,
because
i'm
a
little
barefooted
how
anything
can
be
phrased
here
or
stated
to
carrier
on
what
you
have
in
mind,
let
me
ask
you
this.
let's
suppose
that
a
travel
agent
went
to
a
supplemental
carrier,
and
said,
i
want
to
charter
a
plane
for
all
expense
tours,
such
and
such,
and
such,
and
such
places.
and
the
supplemental
carrier
says
okay.
and
it
turns
out
that
the
travel
agent
has
raised
in
the
supplemental
tour
for
the
washington
d.c.
ski
club
which
is
composed
of
some
people
who
have
got
together
and
they
decided
that
they
make
up
to
friday
of
120
people
or
whatever
it
is
to
tour
some
skiers.
now
on
what
side
of
the
line
does
that
fall
with
respect
to
the
statutory
authorities?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
a
ski
club
and
that's
all
there
is
with
the
people
who
like
to
ski
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
do
the
regulations
now
talk
about
whose
charterable
and
who's
not?
justice
abe
fortas
is
the
ski
club
charterable?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
that's
where
you
draw
the
line.
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
agree
that
the
court
of
appeals
here
has
thrown
out
the
elks
with
the
individual
passenger.
justice
abe
fortas
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
reserves
a
possibility
that
the
supplemental
carriers
can
make
a
deal
with
the
(inaudible)
of
the
ski
club
or
so
on.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
neaher
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
neaher
i'd
like
to
make
sure
that
by
an
impression
i
got
yesterday
in
you
argument
is
what
you
meant
to
convey.
as
i
understand
your
argument
yesterday,
you're
making
a
distinction
between
all
inclusive
tours
all
expense
tours
all
inclusive
tours
on
a
charter
basis
as
you
conceive
it.
and
all
expense
tours
on
a
non-charter
basis
let
me
say
roughly
that
is
to
say
a
basis
which
is
open
to
the
charge
that
it
permits
point
to
point
or
individually
ticketed
service.
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
could
you
answer
that
as
briefly
as
you
can
because
i
have
another
question.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
we're
going
to
get
lost
here.
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
you
pardon
for
saying
that.
justice
abe
fortas
because
then
i'll
have
to
ask
you
without
your
answering
that
question
my
ultimate
question.
i
find
nothing
and
i
looked
again
after
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
see
nothing
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
which
would
permit
the
board
under
this
statutory
authority
to
authorize
the
supplemental
carriers
to
engage
in
the
business
of
selling
or
offering
charter
tours
as
you
defined
them
on
an
all
inclusive
all
expense
basis.
as
i
look
at
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
it
will
prohibit
the
board
from
offering
all
expense
tours
whether
on
a
charter
basis
or
on
any
basis.
now
i
got
the
impression
yesterday
that
you
do
not
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
way
and
i
would
appreciate
your
telling
me
why
and
if
possible
pointing
to
the
language
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
justice
abe
fortas
now
where
will
i
find
that?
justice
abe
fortas
why
for
example
i
read
the
1142
(a)
of
the
record,
court
of
appeals
opinion.
“if
as
we
hold
congress
did
not
give
the
board
power
to
authorize
inclusive
tours
it
is
immaterial
whether
as
the
board
contends
or
proposed
regulations
will
be
effective
in
curving
abuses
of
the
inclusive
tours
certificates.”
and
summing
on
that
same
effect
appears
elsewhere
in
this.
where
is
the
passage
to
which
you
refer?
justice
abe
fortas
by
me
only
i
my
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
i
think
my
brother
hadn't
concurred.
justice
abe
fortas
well
the
board's
order
expressly
says
that
doesn't
it
that
this
does
not
mean
that
the
supplemental
carriers
can
engage
in
individually
ticketed
service?
justice
abe
fortas
well
it's
at
least
arguable
i
suppose.the
difference
between
the
parties
here
between
you
and
your
colleagues
on
one
side
mr.
neaher
on
the
other
is
one
of
administration
that
is
to
say
it's
entirely
conceivable
of
course
a
charter
authority
could
be
used
as
a
subterfuge.
and
if
it
were
used
as
a
subterfuge
in
reality
to
provide
individually
ticketed
services
that
would
conflict
with
the
boards
order
as
i
read
it.
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
think
the
second
circuit
held
in
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
with
respect
to
this
matter
at
hours
discussing
with
mr.
neaher?
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
think
the
second
circuit
probably
never
reached
the
question
of
actual
group
tour
itself.
it
just
said
that
on
inclusive
tour
charters
that
they
felt
constrain
by
the
statements
on
the
floor
on
the
day
of
the
vote
to
keep
the
board
from
having
the
authority
to
issue
this
kind
of
inclusive
tour
charter
under
even
the
most
carefully
hedged
conditions.
it
was
an
absolutely
ban.
