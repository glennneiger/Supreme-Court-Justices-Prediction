justice
byron
r.
white
the
travel
agent
does
not
persist
to
trips
to
the
members
of
the
public
--
justice
byron
r.
white
all
covers
(voice
overlap)
no
preexisting
connection
between
those
who
apply
is
necessary.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
as
far
as
the
record
shows,
the
statement
could
have
been
paired
by
either
mr.
harris
or
mr.
collier.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
as
far
as
the
record
shows
that
it
might
have
been
precisely
what
the
airlines
thought
he
was
doing
when
he
reported
out
the
bill
in
the
house.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
tell
me
anything
in
the
record
to
the
contrary?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
what
makes
mr.
harris'
statement
as
chairman
of
the
house
committee
in
presenting
a
conference
report,
anything
suspect
as
what
at
least
he
had
in
mind?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
this
entitled
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
harris
has
pretty
clearly
said
on
the
floor
on
the
house
that
he
didn't
think
that
the
bill
would
authorize
all
expense
tours.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
might
have
been
that
the
committee
was
-
the
board
might
have
been
left
free
to
define
the
term
within
some
limits
but
i
would
suppose
mr.
harris
was
saying
that
the
board
wasn't
free
to
include
all
expense
tours,
that's
what
he
said
very
clearly.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
case
before
this
amendment
which
authorized
the
board
to
-
where
the
board
was
upheld
in
the
court
on
all
inclusive
tours
as
part
of
the
charter
service.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
split
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
did
you
suggest
before
these
amendments
the
board
had
such
authority
to
define
charter
service?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
when
you
do
that,
include
to
explain
why
is
--
there
was
acknowledgement
on
the
same
thing
on
the
senate
side
from
scott
and
cotton
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--agreeing
with
mr.
harris?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
wanted
some
flexibility
so
they
could
approve
split
charter?
justice
byron
r.
white
their
reporting
was
a
legislative
action
in
one
day?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
these
reports
actually
came
out
of
the
quorum
and
pass
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
supplemental
certification
can
claim
a
charter
that
includes
not
only
the
charter
plane
of
the
travel
agent
and
he
is
soliciting
the
general
public
from
themselves
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
are
you
suggesting
that
under
your
position,(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
can
deal
with
individual
members
of
those
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
couldn't
have
to
make
each
deal
with
the
organization.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
they
went
too
far,
you
wouldn't
have
mind
to
say
we're
pushed
back?
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
someone
reads
the
opinion
as
actually
dealing
with
as
proscribing,
it
really
wouldn't
make
any
difference
to
you
would
it
if
they
were
correct
in
that
aspect?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
if
you
say
they
did
not
do
it
why
you
don't
mind
if
we
reverse
on
something
they
didn't
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
case,
you
talk
about
--
you
don't
argue
that
they
--
that
the
court
of
appeals
would've
been
right
to
had,
for
some
record,
through
the
charter
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
question,
what
congress
decided
to
do
about
that
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well
perhaps
too,
you
say
that
the
supplementary
carrier
itself
would
give
up
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
supplemental
carrier
may
not
sell
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
previous
organizer?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
can
if
a
travel
agents
comes
along
he
can
organize
a
route
and
charter
points.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
what
the
congressman
being
reported
distributed
--
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
report
was
dated
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
travel
agent
does
not
persist
to
trips
to
the
members
of
the

--
justice
byron

all
