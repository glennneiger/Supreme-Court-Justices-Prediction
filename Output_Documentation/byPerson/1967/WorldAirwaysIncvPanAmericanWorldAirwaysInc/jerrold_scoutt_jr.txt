mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
a
preference
to
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
petitioners
for
whom
i'm
speaking.
the
american
society
of
travel
agents
is
the
principal
trade
organization
for
the
travel
agents
who
operate
some
2600
agencies
throughout
united
states
and
canada.
the
six
supplemental
petitioners
hold
certificates
to
engage
in
interstate
and
foreign
air
transportation.
they
largely
operate
jet
aircraft.
they
operate
under
the
same
safety
standards
as
to
the
scheduled
airlines
in
performing
charter
service.
and
they
are
members
of
a
group
of
supplemental
carriers
that
totals
13.
these
13
are
the
remnants
or
the
survivors
of
a
group
that
at
one
time
numbered
almost
150.
these
carriers
are
probably
better
known
by
their
former
name
as
non-scheduled
or
non-scheds
but
at
least
they
officially
require
their
present
name
as
supplementals
in
1955.
one
of
the
important
characteristics
of
this
group,
which
i
don't
think
has
been
mentioned
yet,
is
that
they
have
played
a
very
creative
role
in
the
development
of
air
transportation.
this
will
appear
in
the
senate
report
which
has
been
attached
to
the
legislative
materials
which
accompany
our
brief.
that
senate
report
gives
these
companies
credit
for
developing
the
military
contract
business,
credit
for
developing
the
charter
business,
credit
for
developing
all
cargo
service,
and
credit
for
first
promoting
and
developing
the
air-coach
business.
in
other
words,
this
small
group
of
carriers
which
never
has
accounted
for
more
than
3%
of
the
industry's
total
revenues
have
produced
innovations
and
competition
which
have
literally
reshaped
the
entire
industry.
now
it
was
partly,
i
believe
in
recognition
of
this
contribution
that
congress
decided
that
they
should
be
given
a
permanent
and
a
stable
role
in
air
transportation.
and
the
principal
question
as
to
whether
or
not,
the
board
in
implementing
that
decision
has
exceeded
its
powers
depends
on
the
treatment
that
you
will
accord,
the
statements
that
were
made
by
six
congressmen
on
the
floor
of
congress.
and
it's
to
that
issue
that
i
should
now
like
to
turn.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
these
are
all
nonscheduled
airlines.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
they
all
operate
jet
aircraft
at
this
time
and
they
operate
as
i
said
under
the
same
safety
standards
as
to
the
scheduled
airlines.
yes
sir.
the
six
congressmen
who
spoke
on
the
floor
of
congress
were
these,
senators
thurman,
scott,
and
cotton,
congressman
harris
of
arkansas,
congressman
williams
of
mississippi,
and
congressman
collier
of
illinois.
this
entire
legislative
history
with
which
we
are
now
concerned,
you
of
course
realize
has
been
examined
on
three
separate
occasions
in
lower
courts.
two
of
those
courts
in
looking
at
the
same
legislative
history,
have
said
that
congress
intended
to
leave
to
the
agency
the
job
of
defining
the
term
charter.
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
treated
these
statements
as
constituting
a
binding
congressional
declaration
which
withdrew
from
the
civil
aeronautics
board,
the
power
to
make
this
decision.
now
that
conclusion
is
the
thrust
really
of
the
argument
that
i
would
like
to
consider.
and
there
are
three
points
that
i
would
like
to
develop.
the
first
is
this.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
floor
statements
provide
any
reasonable
explanation
for
the
conference
committee
action
or
the
silence
of
its
report
on
the
subject
of
all
expense
tours.
you
recall
that
the
conference
committee
adopted
without
change
and
without
comment,
the
house
bill.
and
the
report
that
accompanied
the
house
bill,
said
that
the
job
of
defining
charter
should
be
left
to
the
agency.
we
are
now
asked
to
believe
that
what
the
conferees
had
in
mind
was
a
really
a
caveat.
that
the
agency
was
not
to
define
the
term
charter,
to
include
a
particular
kind
of
charter,
that
something
was
reserved
from
this
delegation
of
power.
now
if
indeed,
the
conferees
were
concerned
about
this
matter.
if
they
were
as
concerned
as
the
six
congressmen,
all
of
whom
incidentally
were
members
of
this
17-member
conference
committee.
if
they
were
as
concerned
as
the
six
congressmen,
why
wasn't
there
one
sentence
in
the
conference
report
on
the
subject
of
all
expense
tours?
it
seems
totally
unrealistic
to
us
to
believe
that
a
concerned
majority
of
the
conference
committee
would
have
cast
to
the
subsequent
floor
debates
to
make
known
its
view
on
withholding
the
opportunity
from
the
cab
to
certificate
inclusive
tour
charters.
rather
we
think
that
the
most
plausible
explanation
for
the
senate
and
floor
statements
is
simply
this.
that
a
few
days
before
the
floor
debates,
a
staff
member
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board
in
the
transatlantic
proceeding,
filed
a
brief
in
which
he
recommended
all
expense
tour
authority
be
granted
to
the
supplemental
airlines.
and
that
we
suggest
that
these
floor
statements
are
a
manufactured
response
to
that
recommendation.
that
they
were
designed
to
influence
either
the
agency
or
subsequent
court
action,
and
indeed
senator
thurman
statement
on
this
matter,
recites
the
fact
that
the
board
had
just
--
a
staff
of
the
board
had
just
shortly
before
made
what
he
called
an
intolerable
suggestion.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
two
of
the
statements,
mr.
justice,
are
identical.
the
statement
of
mr.
harris
and
mr.
collier
are
verbatim,
word
for
word.
the
other
statements
are
similar
although
they're
not
identical.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
no,
the
record
does
not
although
the
record
does
show
that
the
representatives
of
the
scheduled
airline
industry
very
actively
participated
in
the
hearings
in
this
case.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
yes,
that's
perfectly
true.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
that
suggestion
is
made
in
the
brief
of
the
respondents.
that
was
the
way
it
happened.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
no,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
the
contrary.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
nothing
at
all.
i
think
that
undoubtedly,
this
is
--
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
i
think
it's
entitled
to
consideration
as
you
look
at
the
entire
fabric
of
the
legislative
history.
i
don't
think
it
is
entitled
to
controlling
consideration.
and
i
think
it
along
with
the
others,
led
the
court
below
to
believe
they
were
dealing
with
what
they
called
a
binding
congressional
declaration.
i
certainly
concede
it
is
relevant.
it's
important
to
look
at
it.
but
i
think
it
has
to
be
tested
and
judged
in
terms
of
the
full
pattern
and
history
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
accomplish
and
what
congress
was
trying
to
prevent.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
yes
sir,
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
my
first
point,
mr.
justice
is
simply,
that
if
the
committee
had
felt
the
way
mr.
harris
felt,
they
certainly
would
have
put
something
in
the
committee
report
to
this
effect,
because
the
committee
was
adopting
word
for
word
the
house
bill.
and
the
report
that
accompanied
the
house
bill
said
that
the
definition
of
charter
should
be
left
to
the
cab.
now
if
mr.
harris
didn't
want
someone
to
draw
the
conclusion
that
the
board
was
free
to
define
this
term,
it
seems
to
me
he
would
have
urged
the
committee
to
say
something
about
it.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
but
i
believe
that
is
true
that
at
the
time
this
legislation
was
being
considered,
the
board
did
have
authority
to
authorize
inclusive
tour
charters.
in
october
of
1961,
that's
roughly
eight
months
before
this
legislation
was
enacted,
the
board
had
placed
this
issue
in
the
transatlantic
investigation.
the
senate
report
recites
that
all
expense
tours
are
part
of
the
traditional
charter
concept.
something
like
this
almost
identical
to
it
had
been
followed
in
the
united
kingdom
for
years.
and
something
reasonably
similar
to
it
had
been
followed
at
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
a
number
of
years.
so
that
there
should
have
been
no
surprise
to
mr.
harris
that
this
was
a
possibility
and
that
had
his
committee
felt
the
way
he
felt,
it
seems
to
me
we
would
have
seen
something
in
the
report.
the
second
objection
that
we
have
to
the
use
that
has
been
made
by
the
court
below
of
the
floor
statements
is
that
they
cannot
be
reconciled
with
either
of
the
statute
or
with
the
house
report.
that
report
is
we've
just
been
discussing
says
the
definition
should
be
left
to
the
agency.
but
the
use,
to
which
the
court
below
puts
these
statements,
is
to
limit
that
delegation
of
power.
it
is
if
you
please
to
freeze
a
restriction
on
the
charter
definition
by
saying
it
does
not
include
inclusive
tour
charter
type
authority.
now
in
this
kind
of
a
conflict,
we
think
the
house
report
should
be
given
a
greater
weight.
as
i've
said
before
we
certainly
recognize
that
this
court
has
frequently
looked
to
debates
as
aids
in
statutory
construction,
that
we
can
find
no
case
except
the
case
here
on
review
where
those
debates
had
been
used
to
introduce
an
ambiguity
and
to
vary
what
we
think
to
be
the
clear
language
of
the
report.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
yes,
that
was
the
case
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
citation
is
365
f.2d
939.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
that
is
the
domestic
inclusive
tour
but
i
call
it
the
domestic
inclusive
tour,
the
split
charter
case
is
348
f.2d,
349.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
no,
these
all
followed
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
think
all
we
have
--
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
well,
perhaps
i
should
say
more
accurately
the
board
asserted
that
it
had
that
authority.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
and
it
asserted
it
in
several
different
ways,
the
most
obvious
being
placing
the
matter
at
issue
in
the
transatlantic
investigation.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
no,
they
adopted
the
house
bill
without
a
comment.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
no,
i
make
the
transition.
i
didn't
make
that
clear.
i'm
sorry
that
i
presume
they
must
have
accepted
the
house
explanation
as
evidenced
in
its
report.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
it
filed
a
report
but
it
was
a
silent
on
the
subject.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
it
didn't
say
anything
on
this
matter.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
that's
true.
the
only
thing,
mr.
justice
that
the
conference
committee
report
does
do
that
is
relevant
to
this
issue
is
to
comment
on
charter
authority
that
it
was
considering
for
the
old
cargo
airlines.
this
was
a
matter
that
was
also
involved
in
this
particular
legislative
review,
and
in
amending
the
statute
to
make
it
clear
that
the
cargo
airlines
should
have
the
right
to
conduct
passenger
charters.
the
conference
committee
does
say
that
this
authority
should
be
granted.
the
dimensions
of
the
charter
authority
should
be
defined
by
the
civil
aeronautics
board
under
such
regulations
as
would
enable
them
to
accomplish
their
statutory
objectives.
now
in
doing
that,
it
seems
to
what's
quite
clearly
that
they
are
continuing
this
concept
of
administrative
flexibility
with
the
term
charter.
now
that
arises
under
a
different
provision
of
the
statute
but
it's
the
same
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
the
inclusive
tours
conducted
by
the
schedule
airlines
are
probably
not
conducted
as
charters.
they're
conducted
under
their
individually
ticketed
authority.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
not
specifically,
no.
the
section
401(e)(6)
does
give
the
board
the
authority
to
authorize
the
scheduled
carriers
to
conduct
charters.
but
that
term
is
not
defined
in
the
statute.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
yes,
they
certainly
do
that
and
to
that
extent
they
are
conducting
an
operation
that
is
very
similar
to
what
we're
describing
here.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
yes,
there
is
a
tariff
that
would
be
filed.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
no,
it
does
not.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
has
no
jurisdiction
on
the
reasonableness
of
rates
and
foreign
air
transportation,
only
in
the
interstate
markets.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
and
we're
talking
about
foreign
here.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
yes,
all
six
members
who
spoke
on
the
floor,
whose
statements
i've
been
discussing
were
members
of
the
17-member
conference
committee.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
no,
we
do
not.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
we
can
only
speculate
about
that.
and
my
only
three
arguments
about
it,
my
first
one
is
that
if
they
really
felt
strongly
about
it,
why
didn't
they
say
something
in
the
conference
report?
it
was
easy
to
do.
and
they
didn't.
and
we
think
that
the
silence
of
that
report
really
is
a
very
significant
fact
in
interpreting
the
legislation.
the
third
point,
if
i
may
proceed
that
constitutes
our
objection
to
the
use
that
has
been
made
of
the
floor
debates
is
that
they
are
not
entitled
too
much
weight
because
the
tours
that
were
authorized
by
the
board
were
not
the
kind
of
tours
to
which
these
congressman
objected.
it's
clear
from
the
statements
that
were
made
on
the
floor
of
the
house
and
the
floor
of
the
senate,
that
what
the
congressmen
were
concerned
about
was
phony
tours.
they
were
concerned
about
these
airlines
offering
a
passenger
a
hamburger,
and
a
taxi
ride
and
calling
it
a
tour.
they
were
concerned
about
tours
that
would
permit
cut
rate
transportation.
they
were
concerned
about
tours
that
would
be
subterfuges.
and
three
or
four
of
them
in
actually
use
that
term.
what
they
were
concerned
about,
i
think
this
is
obvious
from
reading
the
statements,
is
that
these
charter
airlines
by
means
of
this
tour
authority
would
be
placed
in
direct
competition
with
the
scheduled
carriers
for
individually
ticketed
point-to-point
transportation.
that
was
the
thrust
of
it.
let
me
digress
here
just
one
moment
to
make
a
point
that
i
think
needs
clarification.
passengers
on
a
charter
flight
are
issued
tickets.
the
ticket
will
identify
the
passenger,
it
will
identify
the
airline,
the
destination,
the
time
of
departure,
and
in
case
of
international
flights,
will
specify
the
limitations
under
the
warsaw
convention.
the
fact
that
the
passenger
has
a
ticket
doesn't
make
him
an
individually
ticketed
passenger
in
the
sense
we're
using
this
term.
when
we're
talking
about
individually
ticketed
service
of
the
type
operated
by
the
airlines,
we
are
basically
talking
about
point-to-point
competition,
about
going
out
to
the
washington
airport
and
buying
a
ticket
to
san
francisco.
that's
the
kind
of
service
that
the
congress
was
trying
to
protect.
now
whether
the
inclusive
tour
authority
which
was
authorized
by
the
civil
aeronautics
board
was
indeed
a
charter
or
whether
it
was
a
disguise
for
this
point-to-point
transportation
about
which
the
congress
may
spoke
is
not
a
matter
of
the
label
that
you
apply
to
this
thing,
but
rather
it
depends
on
the
substance
of
the
arrangement.
and
we
think
that
if
you
will
look
at
the
examiner's
report,
if
you
will
look
at
the
board's
decision,
you
will
see
that
they
have
gone
through
a
very
careful
analysis
to
balance
the
interest
of
the
scheduled
airlines
on
one
side
who
needed
protection
in
this
point-to-point
market,
and
the
interest
of
the
public
on
the
other
hand
in
desiring
the
benefits
of
low
cost
group
pleasure
transportation.
and
i
suggest
that
you
consider
also
part
378
which
is
the
board's
regulation
that
defines
these
tours.
and
the
significant
characteristics
of
this
regulation
are
these.
an
inclusive
tour
must
cost
10%
more
than
the
individual
ticket
between
the
points
in
question.
nobody
going
from
here
to
san
francisco
is
going
to
pay
10%
more
to
ride
on
a
supplemental
airlines
inclusive
tour.
they
simply
are
not
competitive
for
this
type
of
business.
these
tours
must
be
round
trip.
they
involve
a
minimum
of
seven
days
duration.
they
require
three
overnight
stops
at
three
different
locations.
and
they
can
only
be
sold
by
tour
operators
that
are
thoroughly
regulated
by
the
board.
whenever
a
tour
operator
wants
to
conduct
the
tour,
he
has
to
put
together
his
entire
plan
of
operation,
file
it
with
the
civil
aeronautics
board
90
days
in
advance
of
the
first
flight,
serve
copies
on
all
of
the
scheduled
airlines
that
might
have
an
interest
in
the
case
and
await
their
comments.
the
entire
package
or
the
entire
program
has
been
outlined
in
the
board's
rule
making
--
under
its
rule
making
authority
and
can
be
revised
if
it
fails
to
meet
its
expectations.
as
mr.
wozencraft
indicated,
it's
a
temporary
program
in
any
event.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
there
is
none.
the
scheduled
carriers
do
not
have
authority
to
charter
aircraft
to
tour
operators.
this
particular
type
of
authority
is
reserved
exclusively
for
the
supplemental
airlines.
if
a
person
wants
a
package
tour
and
wants
to
buy
it
from
pan
american
for
example,
the
cost
of
that
tour
would
be
constructed
on
the
basis
of
the
individually
priced
ticket
that
pan
american
has
authorized
to
sell.
it
could
not
be
packaged
on
the
basis
of
a
charter
price
which
almost
inevitably
would
be
substantially
lower.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
yes,
i
think
that
is
true.
the
final
point
to
which
i
should
like
to
make
a
few
comments
concerns
the
procedural
questions
which
have
been
raised
by
the
respondents.
there
are
three
of
them.
first,
they
claim
that
the
certificates
of
two
carriers
were
amended
without
hearing
as
required
by
your
decision
in
the
delta
case,
and
secondly
they
claim
that
when
the
board
took
official
notice
of
certain
materials
that
should
have
accorded
them
the
right
to
rebut
or
explain
these
materials.
the
simple
answer
to
these
arguments
is
that
they
were
not
raised
before
the
civil
aeronautics
board
and
your
consideration
of
them
is
barred
by
section
1006(e)
of
the
federal
aviation
act.
the
third
procedural
question
they
raised
is
this;
that
the
record
before
the
board
in
1963
as
supplemented
by
the
material
of
which
the
board
took
official
notice
was
not
an
adequate
basis
for
the
decision
in
the
transatlantic
case
in
1966.
in
other
words,
they're
saying
that
the
board
abused
its
discretion
by
not
reopening
the
hearing.
our
answers
to
this
are
two
fold.
first
of
all,
we
think
the
agency
must
have
broad
discretion
in
deciding
whether
or
not
the
record
is
adequate.
and
secondly,
all
of
the
arguments
raised
by
the
respondent
carriers
as
to
the
need
for
a
rehearing
were
very
carefully
covered
by
the
board
in
its
decision.
you
will
see
these
arguments
summarized
on
page
81
of
respondent's
brief.
they
talk
about
certain
international
problems
which
are
really
policy
questions,
not
evidentiary
matters.
they
talk
about
the
role
of
the
travel
agent.
this
was
settled
by
the
rule
making
proceeding
in
part
378,
and
didn't
require
further
hearings.
and
finally,
they
talk
about
the
financial
condition
of
the
industry
both
scheduled
carriers
and
the
supplemental
airlines.
and
this
is
discussed
in
detail
on
the
basis
of
officially
noticed
material
filed
in
large
part
by
the
respondents
themselves,
and
set
forth
in
detail
in
the
opinion.
i'd
like
to
remind
you
that
they
did
not
file
a
petition
for
reconsideration
of
that
order.
they
did
not
specify
in
what
respects
they
found
that
officially
noticed
material
to
be
inadequate
and
in
this
--
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
very
similar
statements
were
made
--
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
--
on
the
senate
side,
that's
right.
my
answer
to
that
is
this.
whether
the
senate
bill
had
been
enacted
or
the
house
bill
had
been
enacted,
in
our
view,
the
civil
aeronautics
board
would
still
have
had
the
power
to
authorize
inclusive
tour
charters
under
the
definition
of
either
bill.
and
so
when
the
senate?
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
well,
i
have
no
doubt
that
that
accurately
expresses
mr.
harris'
viewpoint
and
of
course
the
viewpoint
of
the
other
five
who
spoke
on
the
subject.
the
quarrel
is
this
doesn't
constitute
a
binding
congressional
declaration.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
they
were
all
members
of
the
congress
committee
that
--
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
well
certainly
you
can
look
to
these
statements
but
we
think
you
also
must
look
to
what
the
congress
was
trying
to
do,
what
the
purposes
of
the
legislation
were,
what
the
evils
were,
and
what
the
other
gentlemen
thought
about
the
subject,
most
of
the
same
six
you
recall
spoke
almost
as
vehemently
against
the
split
charter
concept,
which
of
course,
has
been
reviewed
and
approved
by
the
lower
court
as
being
within
the
competence
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
it
wasn't
explained
--
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
yes.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
excuse
me.
i
didn't
get
it.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
yes,
they
virtually
said
that.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
well
mr.
justice,
we
don't
even
know
who
was
on
the
floor
when
these
matters
were
being
considered.
we
do
--
and
being
debated.
for
example
in
the
senate,
the
conference
report
is
approved
without
a
roll
call
out
and
in
the
house
following
the
floor
statements.
mr.
collier,
who
made
one
of
them,
observed
there
was
not
a
quorum
preset
person
and
they
had
asked
for
a
call
of
the
absent
members.
so
we
really
don't
--
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
after
the
quorum
can
be
--
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
yes,
i
would
feel
much
differently.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
well
the
same
six
did
not
constitute
the
majority
of
the
conference
committee.
and
it
would
have
been
so
simple,
had
the
committee
felt
this
way
to
add
one
sentence
in
the
conference
committee
report
to
this
effect.
it's
just
unrealistic
for
me
to
believe
that
in
the
face
of
a
contrary
interpretation
as
of
the
time
the
conference
committee
must
have
considered
this
--
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
specifies
when
they
met.
the
report
-?
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
their
report
is
dated
the
28th
of
june.
these
debates
took
place
on
the
29th.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
yes
sir.
it
did.
and
as
i
said
i
think
the
reason
for
the
debates
was
because
of
the
board
action
in
the
transatlantic
case.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
a
preference
to
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
petitioners
for
whom
i'm
speaking.
the
american
society
of
travel
agents
is
the
principal
trade
organization
for
the
travel
agents
who
operate
some
2600
agencies
throughout
united
states
and
canada.
the
six
supplemental
petitioners
hold
certificates
to
engage
in
interstate
and
foreign
air
transportation.
they
largely
operate
jet
aircraft.
they
operate
under
the
same
safety
standards
as
to
the
scheduled
airlines
in
performing
charter
service.
and
they
are
members
of
a
group
of
supplemental
carriers
that
totals
13.
these
13
are
the
remnants
or
the
survivors
of
a
group
that
at
one
time
numbered
almost
150.
these
carriers
are
probably
better
known
by
their
former
name
as
non-scheduled
or
non-scheds
but
at
least
they
officially
require
their
present
name
as
supplementals
in
1955.
one
of
the
important
characteristics
of
this
group,
which
i
don't
think
has
been
mentioned
yet,
is
that
they
have
played
a
very
creative
role
in
the
development
of
air
transportation.
this
will
appear
in
the
senate
report
which
has
been
attached
to
the
legislative
materials
which
accompany
our
brief.
that
senate
report
gives
these
companies
credit
for
developing
the
military
contract
business,
credit
for
developing
the
charter
business,
credit
for
developing
all
cargo
service,
and
credit
for
first
promoting
and
developing
the
air-coach
business.
in
other
words,
this
small
group
of
carriers
which
never
has
accounted
for
more
than
3%
of
the
industry's
total
revenues
have
produced
innovations
and
competition
which
have
literally
reshaped
the
entire
industry.
now
it
was
partly,
i
believe
in
recognition
of
this
contribution
that
congress
decided
that
they
should
be
given
a
permanent
and
a
stable
role
in
air
transportation.
and
the
principal
question
as
to
whether
or
not,
the
board
in
implementing
that
decision
has
exceeded
its
powers
depends
on
the
treatment
that
you
will
accord,
the
statements
that
were
made
by
six
congressmen
on
the
floor
of
congress.
and
it's
to
that
issue
that
i
should
now
like
to
turn.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
these
are
all
nonscheduled
airlines.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
they
all
operate
jet
aircraft
at
this
time
and
they
operate
as
i
said
under
the
same
safety
standards
as
to
the
scheduled
airlines.
yes
sir.
the
six
congressmen
who
spoke
on
the
floor
of
congress
were
these,
senators
thurman,
scott,
and
cotton,
congressman
harris
of
arkansas,
congressman
williams
of
mississippi,
and
congressman
collier
of
illinois.
this
entire
legislative
history
with
which
we
are
now
concerned,
you
of
course
realize
has
been
examined
on
three
separate
occasions
in
lower
courts.
two
of
those
courts
in
looking
at
the
same
legislative
history,
have
said
that
congress
intended
to
leave
to
the
agency
the
job
of
defining
the
term
charter.
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
treated
these
statements
as
constituting
a
binding
congressional
declaration
which
withdrew
from
the
civil
aeronautics
board,
the
power
to
make
this
decision.
now
that
conclusion
is
the
thrust
really
of
the
argument
that
i
would
like
to
consider.
and
there
are
three
points
that
i
would
like
to
develop.
the
first
is
this.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
floor
statements
provide
any
reasonable
explanation
for
the
conference
committee
action
or
the
silence
of
its
report
on
the
subject
of
all
expense
tours.
you
recall
that
the
conference
committee
adopted
without
change
and
without
comment,
the
house
bill.
and
the
report
that
accompanied
the
house
bill,
said
that
the
job
of
defining
charter
should
be
left
to
the
agency.
we
are
now
asked
to
believe
that
what
the
conferees
had
in
mind
was
a
really
a
caveat.
that
the
agency
was
not
to
define
the
term
charter,
to
include
a
particular
kind
of
charter,
that
something
was
reserved
from
this
delegation
of
power.
now
if
indeed,
the
conferees
were
concerned
about
this
matter.
if
they
were
as
concerned
as
the
six
congressmen,
all
of
whom
incidentally
were
members
of
this
17-member
conference
committee.
if
they
were
as
concerned
as
the
six
congressmen,
why
wasn't
there
one
sentence
in
the
conference
report
on
the
subject
of
all
expense
tours?
it
seems
totally
unrealistic
to
us
to
believe
that
a
concerned
majority
of
the
conference
committee
would
have
cast
to
the
subsequent
floor
debates
to
make
known
its
view
on
withholding
the
opportunity
from
the
cab
to
certificate
inclusive
tour
charters.
rather
we
think
that
the
most
plausible
explanation
for
the
senate
and
floor
statements
is
simply
this.
that
a
few
days
before
the
floor
debates,
a
staff
member
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board
in
the
transatlantic
proceeding,
filed
a
brief
in
which
he
recommended
all
expense
tour
authority
be
granted
to
the
supplemental
airlines.
and
that
we
suggest
that
these
floor
statements
are
a
manufactured
response
to
that
recommendation.
that
they
were
designed
to
influence
either
the
agency
or
subsequent
court
action,
and
indeed
senator
thurman
statement
on
this
matter,
recites
the
fact
that
the
board
had
just
--
a
staff
of
the
board
had
just
shortly
before
made
what
he
called
an
intolerable
suggestion.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
two
of
the
statements,
mr.
justice,
are
identical.
the
statement
of
mr.
harris
and
mr.
collier
are
verbatim,
word
for
word.
the
other
statements
are
similar
although
they're
not
identical.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
no,
the
record
does
not
although
the
record
does
show
that
the
representatives
of
the
scheduled
airline
industry
very
actively
participated
in
the
hearings
in
this
case.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
yes,
that's
perfectly
true.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
that
suggestion
is
made
in
the
brief
of
the
respondents.
that
was
the
way
it
happened.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
no,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
the
contrary.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
nothing
at
all.
i
think
that
undoubtedly,
this
is
--
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
i
think
it's
entitled
to
consideration
as
you
look
at
the
entire
fabric
of
the
legislative
history.
i
don't
think
it
is
entitled
to
controlling
consideration.
and
i
think
it
along
with
the
others,
led
the
court
below
to
believe
they
were
dealing
with
what
they
called
a
binding
congressional
declaration.
i
certainly
concede
it
is
relevant.
it's
important
to
look
at
it.
but
i
think
it
has
to
be
tested
and
judged
in
terms
of
the
full
pattern
and
history
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
accomplish
and
what
congress
was
trying
to
prevent.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
yes
sir,
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
my
first
point,
mr.
justice
is
simply,
that
if
the
committee
had
felt
the
way
mr.
harris
felt,
they
certainly
would
have
put
something
in
the
committee
report
to
this
effect,
because
the
committee
was
adopting
word
for
word
the
house
bill.
and
the
report
that
accompanied
the
house
bill
said
that
the
definition
of
charter
should
be
left
to
the
cab.
now
if
mr.
harris
didn't
want
someone
to
draw
the
conclusion
that
the
board
was
free
to
define
this
term,
it
seems
to
me
he
would
have
urged
the
committee
to
say
something
about
it.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
but
i
believe
that
is
true
that
at
the
time
this
legislation
was
being
considered,
the
board
did
have
authority
to
authorize
inclusive
tour
charters.
in
october
of
1961,
that's
roughly
eight
months
before
this
legislation
was
enacted,
the
board
had
placed
this
issue
in
the
transatlantic
investigation.
the
senate
report
recites
that
all
expense
tours
are
part
of
the
traditional
charter
concept.
something
like
this
almost
identical
to
it
had
been
followed
in
the
united
kingdom
for
years.
and
something
reasonably
similar
to
it
had
been
followed
at
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
a
number
of
years.
so
that
there
should
have
been
no
surprise
to
mr.
harris
that
this
was
a
possibility
and
that
had
his
committee
felt
the
way
he
felt,
it
seems
to
me
we
would
have
seen
something
in
the
report.
the
second
objection
that
we
have
to
the
use
that
has
been
made
by
the
court
below
of
the
floor
statements
is
that
they
cannot
be
reconciled
with
either
of
the
statute
or
with
the
house
report.
that
report
is
we've
just
been
discussing
says
the
definition
should
be
left
to
the
agency.
but
the
use,
to
which
the
court
below
puts
these
statements,
is
to
limit
that
delegation
of
power.
it
is
if
you
please
to
freeze
a
restriction
on
the
charter
definition
by
saying
it
does
not
include
inclusive
tour
charter
type
authority.
now
in
this
kind
of
a
conflict,
we
think
the
house
report
should
be
given
a
greater
weight.
as
i've
said
before
we
certainly
recognize
that
this
court
has
frequently
looked
to
debates
as
aids
in
statutory
construction,
that
we
can
find
no
case
except
the
case
here
on
review
where
those
debates
had
been
used
to
introduce
an
ambiguity
and
to
vary
what
we
think
to
be
the
clear
language
of
the
report.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
yes,
that
was
the
case
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
citation
is
365
f.2d
939.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
that
is
the
domestic
inclusive
tour
but
i
call
it
the
domestic
inclusive
tour,
the
split
charter
case
is
348
f.2d,
349.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
no,
these
all
followed
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
think
all
we
have
--
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
well,
perhaps
i
should
say
more
accurately
the
board
asserted
that
it
had
that
authority.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
and
it
asserted
it
in
several
different
ways,
the
most
obvious
being
placing
the
matter
at
issue
in
the
transatlantic
investigation.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
no,
they
adopted
the
house
bill
without
a
comment.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
no,
i
make
the
transition.
i
didn't
make
that
clear.
i'm
sorry
that
i
presume
they
must
have
accepted
the
house
explanation
as
evidenced
in
its
report.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
it
filed
a
report
but
it
was
a
silent
on
the
subject.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
it
didn't
say
anything
on
this
matter.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
that's
true.
the
only
thing,
mr.
justice
that
the
conference
committee
report
does
do
that
is
relevant
to
this
issue
is
to
comment
on
charter
authority
that
it
was
considering
for
the
old
cargo
airlines.
this
was
a
matter
that
was
also
involved
in
this
particular
legislative
review,
and
in
amending
the
statute
to
make
it
clear
that
the
cargo
airlines
should
have
the
right
to
conduct
passenger
charters.
the
conference
committee
does
say
that
this
authority
should
be
granted.
the
dimensions
of
the
charter
authority
should
be
defined
by
the
civil
aeronautics
board
under
such
regulations
as
would
enable
them
to
accomplish
their
statutory
objectives.
now
in
doing
that,
it
seems
to
what's
quite
clearly
that
they
are
continuing
this
concept
of
administrative
flexibility
with
the
term
charter.
now
that
arises
under
a
different
provision
of
the
statute
but
it's
the
same
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
the
inclusive
tours
conducted
by
the
schedule
airlines
are
probably
not
conducted
as
charters.
they're
conducted
under
their
individually
ticketed
authority.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
not
specifically,
no.
the
section
401(e)(6)
does
give
the
board
the
authority
to
authorize
the
scheduled
carriers
to
conduct
charters.
but
that
term
is
not
defined
in
the
statute.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
yes,
they
certainly
do
that
and
to
that
extent
they
are
conducting
an
operation
that
is
very
similar
to
what
we're
describing
here.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
yes,
there
is
a
tariff
that
would
be
filed.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
no,
it
does
not.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
has
no
jurisdiction
on
the
reasonableness
of
rates
and
foreign
air
transportation,
only
in
the
interstate
markets.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
and
we're
talking
about
foreign
here.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
yes,
all
six
members
who
spoke
on
the
floor,
whose
statements
i've
been
discussing
were
members
of
the
17-member
conference
committee.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
no,
we
do
not.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
we
can
only
speculate
about
that.
and
my
only
three
arguments
about
it,
my
first
one
is
that
if
they
really
felt
strongly
about
it,
why
didn't
they
say
something
in
the
conference
report?
it
was
easy
to
do.
and
they
didn't.
and
we
think
that
the
silence
of
that
report
really
is
a
very
significant
fact
in
interpreting
the
legislation.
the
third
point,
if
i
may
proceed
that
constitutes
our
objection
to
the
use
that
has
been
made
of
the
floor
debates
is
that
they
are
not
entitled
too
much
weight
because
the
tours
that
were
authorized
by
the
board
were
not
the
kind
of
tours
to
which
these
congressman
objected.
it's
clear
from
the
statements
that
were
made
on
the
floor
of
the
house
and
the
floor
of
the
senate,
that
what
the
congressmen
were
concerned
about
was
phony
tours.
they
were
concerned
about
these
airlines
offering
a
passenger
a
hamburger,
and
a
taxi
ride
and
calling
it
a
tour.
they
were
concerned
about
tours
that
would
permit
cut
rate
transportation.
they
were
concerned
about
tours
that
would
be
subterfuges.
and
three
or
four
of
them
in
actually
use
that
term.
what
they
were
concerned
about,
i
think
this
is
obvious
from
reading
the
statements,
is
that
these
charter
airlines
by
means
of
this
tour
authority
would
be
placed
in
direct
competition
with
the
scheduled
carriers
for
individually
ticketed
point-to-point
transportation.
that
was
the
thrust
of
it.
let
me
digress
here
just
one
moment
to
make
a
point
that
i
think
needs
clarification.
passengers
on
a
charter
flight
are
issued
tickets.
the
ticket
will
identify
the
passenger,
it
will
identify
the
airline,
the
destination,
the
time
of
departure,
and
in
case
of
international
flights,
will
specify
the
limitations
under
the
warsaw
convention.
the
fact
that
the
passenger
has
a
ticket
doesn't
make
him
an
individually
ticketed
passenger
in
the
sense
we're
using
this
term.
when
we're
talking
about
individually
ticketed
service
of
the
type
operated
by
the
airlines,
we
are
basically
talking
about
point-to-point
competition,
about
going
out
to
the
washington
airport
and
buying
a
ticket
to
san
francisco.
that's
the
kind
of
service
that
the
congress
was
trying
to
protect.
now
whether
the
inclusive
tour
authority
which
was
authorized
by
the
civil
aeronautics
board
was
indeed
a
charter
or
whether
it
was
a
disguise
for
this
point-to-point
transportation
about
which
the
congress
may
spoke
is
not
a
matter
of
the
label
that
you
apply
to
this
thing,
but
rather
it
depends
on
the
substance
of
the
arrangement.
and
we
think
that
if
you
will
look
at
the
examiner's
report,
if
you
will
look
at
the
board's
decision,
you
will
see
that
they
have
gone
through
a
very
careful
analysis
to
balance
the
interest
of
the
scheduled
airlines
on
one
side
who
needed
protection
in
this
point-to-point
market,
and
the
interest
of
the
public
on
the
other
hand
in
desiring
the
benefits
of
low
cost
group
pleasure
transportation.
and
i
suggest
that
you
consider
also
part
378
which
is
the
board's
regulation
that
defines
these
tours.
and
the
significant
characteristics
of
this
regulation
are
these.
an
inclusive
tour
must
cost
10%
more
than
the
individual
ticket
between
the
points
in
question.
nobody
going
from
here
to
san
francisco
is
going
to
pay
10%
more
to
ride
on
a
supplemental
airlines
inclusive
tour.
they
simply
are
not
competitive
for
this
type
of
business.
these
tours
must
be
round
trip.
they
involve
a
minimum
of
seven
days
duration.
they
require
three
overnight
stops
at
three
different
locations.
and
they
can
only
be
sold
by
tour
operators
that
are
thoroughly
regulated
by
the
board.
whenever
a
tour
operator
wants
to
conduct
the
tour,
he
has
to
put
together
his
entire
plan
of
operation,
file
it
with
the
civil
aeronautics
board
90
days
in
advance
of
the
first
flight,
serve
copies
on
all
of
the
scheduled
airlines
that
might
have
an
interest
in
the
case
and
await
their
comments.
the
entire
package
or
the
entire
program
has
been
outlined
in
the
board's
rule
making
--
under
its
rule
making
authority
and
can
be
revised
if
it
fails
to
meet
its
expectations.
as
mr.
wozencraft
indicated,
it's
a
temporary
program
in
any
event.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
there
is
none.
the
scheduled
carriers
do
not
have
authority
to
charter
aircraft
to
tour
operators.
this
particular
type
of
authority
is
reserved
exclusively
for
the
supplemental
airlines.
if
a
person
wants
a
package
tour
and
wants
to
buy
it
from
pan
american
for
example,
the
cost
of
that
tour
would
be
constructed
on
the
basis
of
the
individually
priced
ticket
that
pan
american
has
authorized
to
sell.
it
could
not
be
packaged
on
the
basis
of
a
charter
price
which
almost
inevitably
would
be
substantially
lower.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
yes,
i
think
that
is
true.
the
final
point
to
which
i
should
like
to
make
a
few
comments
concerns
the
procedural
questions
which
have
been
raised
by
the
respondents.
there
are
three
of
them.
first,
they
claim
that
the
certificates
of
two
carriers
were
amended
without
hearing
as
required
by
your
decision
in
the
delta
case,
and
secondly
they
claim
that
when
the
board
took
official
notice
of
certain
materials
that
should
have
accorded
them
the
right
to
rebut
or
explain
these
materials.
the
simple
answer
to
these
arguments
is
that
they
were
not
raised
before
the
civil
aeronautics
board
and
your
consideration
of
them
is
barred
by
section
1006(e)
of
the
federal
aviation
act.
the
third
procedural
question
they
raised
is
this;
that
the
record
before
the
board
in
1963
as
supplemented
by
the
material
of
which
the
board
took
official
notice
was
not
an
adequate
basis
for
the
decision
in
the
transatlantic
case
in
1966.
in
other
words,
they're
saying
that
the
board
abused
its
discretion
by
not
reopening
the
hearing.
our
answers
to
this
are
two
fold.
first
of
all,
we
think
the
agency
must
have
broad
discretion
in
deciding
whether
or
not
the
record
is
adequate.
and
secondly,
all
of
the
arguments
raised
by
the
respondent
carriers
as
to
the
need
for
a
rehearing
were
very
carefully
covered
by
the
board
in
its
decision.
you
will
see
these
arguments
summarized
on
page
81
of
respondent's
brief.
they
talk
about
certain
international
problems
which
are
really
policy
questions,
not
evidentiary
matters.
they
talk
about
the
role
of
the
travel
agent.
this
was
settled
by
the
rule
making
proceeding
in
part
378,
and
didn't
require
further
hearings.
and
finally,
they
talk
about
the
financial
condition
of
the
industry
both
scheduled
carriers
and
the
supplemental
airlines.
and
this
is
discussed
in
detail
on
the
basis
of
officially
noticed
material
filed
in
large
part
by
the
respondents
themselves,
and
set
forth
in
detail
in
the
opinion.
i'd
like
to
remind
you
that
they
did
not
file
a
petition
for
reconsideration
of
that
order.
they
did
not
specify
in
what
respects
they
found
that
officially
noticed
material
to
be
inadequate
and
in
this
--
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
very
similar
statements
were
made
--
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
--
on
the
senate
side,
that's
right.
my
answer
to
that
is
this.
whether
the
senate
bill
had
been
enacted
or
the
house
bill
had
been
enacted,
in
our
view,
the
civil
aeronautics
board
would
still
have
had
the
power
to
authorize
inclusive
tour
charters
under
the
definition
of
either
bill.
and
so
when
the
senate?
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
well,
i
have
no
doubt
that
that
accurately
expresses
mr.
harris'
viewpoint
and
of
course
the
viewpoint
of
the
other
five
who
spoke
on
the
subject.
the
quarrel
is
this
doesn't
constitute
a
binding
congressional
declaration.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
they
were
all
members
of
the
congress
committee
that
--
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
well
certainly
you
can
look
to
these
statements
but
we
think
you
also
must
look
to
what
the
congress
was
trying
to
do,
what
the
purposes
of
the
legislation
were,
what
the
evils
were,
and
what
the
other
gentlemen
thought
about
the
subject,
most
of
the
same
six
you
recall
spoke
almost
as
vehemently
against
the
split
charter
concept,
which
of
course,
has
been
reviewed
and
approved
by
the
lower
court
as
being
within
the
competence
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
it
wasn't
explained
--
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
yes.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
excuse
me.
i
didn't
get
it.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
yes,
they
virtually
said
that.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
well
mr.
justice,
we
don't
even
know
who
was
on
the
floor
when
these
matters
were
being
considered.
we
do
--
and
being
debated.
for
example
in
the
senate,
the
conference
report
is
approved
without
a
roll
call
out
and
in
the
house
following
the
floor
statements.
mr.
collier,
who
made
one
of
them,
observed
there
was
not
a
quorum
preset
person
and
they
had
asked
for
a
call
of
the
absent
members.
so
we
really
don't
--
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
after
the
quorum
can
be
--
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
yes,
i
would
feel
much
differently.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
well
the
same
six
did
not
constitute
the
majority
of
the
conference
committee.
and
it
would
have
been
so
simple,
had
the
committee
felt
this
way
to
add
one
sentence
in
the
conference
committee
report
to
this
effect.
it's
just
unrealistic
for
me
to
believe
that
in
the
face
of
a
contrary
interpretation
as
of
the
time
the
conference
committee
must
have
considered
this
--
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
specifies
when
they
met.
the
report
-?
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
their
report
is
dated
the
28th
of
june.
these
debates
took
place
on
the
29th.
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
jr.
yes
sir.
it
did.
and
as
i
said
i
think
the
reason
for
the
debates
was
because
of
the
board
action
in
the
transatlantic
case.
