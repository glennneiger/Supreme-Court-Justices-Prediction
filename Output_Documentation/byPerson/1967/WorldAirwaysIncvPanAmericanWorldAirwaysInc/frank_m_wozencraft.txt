mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board,
petitioner
in
number
946.
the
petitioner
in
the
other
two
cases
was
consolidated
here
for
oral
argument.
our
six
supplemental
air
carriers
in
number
800,
and
the
american
society
of
travel
agents
in
number
969,
and
the
argument
on
their
behalf
will
be
presented
by
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
with
whom
i
will
share
petitioner's
time.
in
all
three
cases,
the
respondents
are
pan
american,
twa,
and
american
airlines,
regularly
schedule
trunk
carriers.
these
cases
are
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
that
court
struck
down
and
has
begun
the
cab
statutory
authority.
several
related
orders
which
certified
supplemental
air
carriers
to
engage
in
inclusive
tour
charters
involving
foreign
transportation.
this
decision
is
in
direct
conflict
with
the
prior
decision
of
the
u.s.court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
which
had
affirmed
cab
orders,
authorizing
inclusive
tour
charters
in
the
domestic
market.
american
airlines
versus
cab
which
is
reported
at
365
f.2d
939,
and
is
included
as
an
appendix
to
the
petition
for
the
supplemental
carriers.
these
two
decisions
were
based
on
the
same
provisions
of
a
1962
statute,
amending
the
federal
aviation
act,
sections
401
subsection
(d)
and
(e)
and
101(32)
and
(33)
of
that
act.
they
involved
orders
issued
in
the
same
proceeding,
the
supplemental
air
service
proceeding
which
had
begun
in
1963.
they
we're
not
these
--
orders
were
not
separated
on
appeal
because
the
domestic
orders
did
not
require
presidential
approval.
and
that
to
the
domestic
orders
were
appealed
by
the
trunk
lines,
and
upheld
by
the
d.c.
circuit.
the
orders
involving
foreign
transportation,
received
the
necessary
presidential
approval
in
september
of
1966
along
with
additional
orders,
issued
in
the
trans-atlantic
proceeding
of
the
board,
in
which
the
inclusive
tour
phase
had
been
reopened
in
1965.
after
the
hearing
examiner's
report
in
the
supplemental
proceeding,
the
trunk
lines
did
not
ask
this
court
to
review
the
district
of
columbia
decision
which
became
final.
instead,
they
appealed
to
the
second
circuit
from
the
cab
orders
involving
foreign
tours.
thus
while
only
foreign
tourists
were
involved
in
this
case,
this
court's
decision
on
the
merits,
well
obviously,
controlled
domestic
tours
as
well.
moreover,
a
decision
limiting
the
board's
power
here
could
also
cast
a
serious
cloud
on
a
1965
decision
by
a
different
panel
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals,
the
so-called
split
charter
decision.
american
airlines
versus
cab
which
is
recorded
at
348
f.2d,
349.
that
case
held
that
the
board
had
authority
under
the
1962
amendments
to
define
charter
so
as
to
permit
the
supplementals
to
split
the
charter
of
one
plane
between
two
groups.
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
relied
on
that
case
and
cited
it
and
quoted
from
it,
in
reaching
his
decision
here.
in
my
statement,
i
will
attempt
to
discuss
the
principal
issue
in
this
case,
the
essential
facts,
and
the
background
and
history
of
the
1962
amendments
through
the
conference
report
stage
where
it
was
presented
to
the
congress
in
the
form
in
which
it
was
enacted.
mr.
scoutt
will
deal
with
certain
statements
made
by
members
of
congress
when
the
conference
committee
report
reached
the
floor.
he
will
also
discuss
the
general
role
of
the
supplemental
carriers
in
the
air
transportation
industry,
and
certain
procedural
objections
of
respondent
to
some
of
board's
orders
which
were
not
reached
below.
in
our
view,
the
principal
issue
here
is
one
of
the
board's
expressed
authority
under
the
1962
statute,
to
permit
charter
trips
by
supplemental
air
carriers,
is
restricted
by
the
act's
legislative
history
to
exclude
charters
to
tour
operators
who
organize
group
tours
including
more
than
just
air
transportation.
a
respondent's
brief
seeks
at
its
beginning
to
shift
the
emphasis
to
whether
inclusive
tour
arrangements
can
be
considered
as
charters.
but
the
inclusive
tours
authorized
by
the
cab
under
the
contested
orders
are
clearly
based
on
a
contract
between
a
carrier
and
a
tour
operator
acting
as
principal
not
agent,
which
is
a
charter
within
every
accepted
meaning
of
the
term.
the
tour
operator
is
an
independent
contractor.
he
pays
a
single
price
to
the
aircraft
on
a
time,
trip,
or
mileage
basis.
the
economic
risk
is
entirely
his
no
matter
how
many
or
how
few
passengers
are
actually
carried,
he
pays,
and
the
supplemental
carrier
receives
the
same
lump
sum
price
for
the
charter.
in
our
view,
this
concept
comes
squarely
within
the
authority
of
the
board
under
the
1962
amendments.
that
legislation
climaxed
years
of
controversy
as
to
the
place
of
the
nonscheduled
or
supplemental
carriers
as
they're
now
called
in
the
transportation
industry.
its
basic
purpose
was
to
establish
a
stable
and
useful
role
for
that
creative
segment
of
the
industry,
without
jeopardizing
the
regularly
scheduled
carriers.
in
our
brief
at
pages
9
through
12
discusses
that
history
as
to
the
opinions
of
both
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
he
can
offer
them
to
anybody
he
wishes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
correct,
sir.
this
is
a
difference
between
this
and
another
provision
whereby
the
supplemental
carriers
themselves
can
charter
the
plane
to
groups
where
there
is
a
preexisting
connection.
in
the
case
of
the
tour
operator,
however,
no
such
connection
is
required
but
he
cannot
split
a
charter
with
any
other
tour
operator.
he
has
to
take
the
whole
plane.
and
the
group
is
formed
by
the
choice
of
the
itinerary
which
he
offers.
affinity
in
the
view
of
the
board
is
provided
by
the
fact
that
these
people
are
all
signing
up
for
the
same
itinerary.
and
in
doing
that
they
accept
of
course,
considerable
rigidities
as
the
board
and
courts
recognized.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
no,
it
may
not.
let
me
say
this,
sir.
it
may
as
far
as
the
contract
with
the
supplemental
carrier
is
concerned.
but
the
board
requires
a
prior
authorization
of
each
of
these
chartered
trips.
and
the
tour
operator
must
submit
a
filing
to
the
board
along
with
the
airline.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
he
must
include
at
least
hotel
reservations
and
ground
transportation.
in
practice,
there
are
usually
a
great
many
other
items
included.
it
also
as
always
around
trip
situation,
it
comes
on
back
to
where
it
started
i
believe.
and
so
you
have
a
package
tour,
it's
the
customary
vernacular
i
believe
in
the
travel
agent.
there's
this
where
people
sign
up
for
a
particular
package.
it
is
not
simply
point-to-point
transportation.
the
man
who
go
and
takes
that
trip
must
go
on
that
particular
plane,
at
that
particular
time.
he
does
not
have
his
choice
of
the
schedule
of
the
air
carriers
as
a
member
of
the
public
dealing
directly
with
the
airlines
would
have.
now
these
1962
amendments
attempted
to
accomplish
the
role
that
the
supplemental
carriers
should
have
in
this
industry
by
authorizing
them
to
engage
in
chartered
trips.
and
according
to
statute
now,
charter
trips
in
air
transportation
to
supplement
the
schedule
of
service.
it
did
not
authorize
them
to
provide
individually
ticketed
point-to-point
transportation.
in
previous
days
before
these
amendments,
the
supplemental
carriers
have
been
authorized
to
run
a
limited
number
of
regular
point-to-point
trips
a
month
and
this
statute,
terminated
their
authority
to
do
that
with
a
two-year
interim
delay
period
for
them
to
phase
out
on
it,
but
it
left
them
with
full
authority
to
conduct
chartered
services
as
authorized
by
the
board.
now
in
our
view,
this
provides
a
classic
example
of
a
kind
of
situation
in
which
an
administrative
agency
like
the
cab
is
best
equipped
to
operate.
recently
as
this
past
january
in
horton
versus
kentucky
utilities,
this
court
reemphasized
the
established
rule
within
questions
of
statutory
interpretation
involving
agency
authority.
the
agency's
own
determination
should
be
set
aside
only
where
it
lacks
reasonable
support
in
relation
to
the
statutory
purpose.
we
also
cited
page
23
of
our
brief,
the
several
other
cases
that
reflect
in
recent
times
as
long
established
doctrine.
now,
the
word
charter
which
we're
talking
about
defining
here
has
been
in
the
federal
aviation
act
since
it's
enactment
in
1938.
it
is
never
been
defined
in
the
act
itself,
only
by
the
board.
and
the
determination
as
to
what
kinds
of
charters
the
supplemental
airlines
should
be
permitted
to
make,
involves
exceedingly
intricate
questions
of
economic
facts
and
policies.
as
the
hearing
examiners
recommended
opinion
--
this
decision
in
his
opinion
and
the
opinions
of
both
courts,
the
second
circuit
and
the
district
of
columbia
court
both
indicate.
and
in
fact
as
early
as
1961,
the
board
added
to
the
issues
in
its
transatlantic
proceeding,
the
question
of
whether
the
supplementals
should
be
authorized
to
charter
their
aircraft
to
tour
operators
for
all
expense
tours.
and
they
pointed
out
there
in
1961
that
that
this
was
very
different
from
individual
ticketing.
this
appears
at
pages
644
through
646(a)
of
the
record.
now
this
authority
was
not
granted
by
the
board
in
the
initial
orders
in
that
proceeding.
they
determine
in
their
discretion
not
that
they
did
not
have
authority
to
do
so,
but
at
the
time
considering
the
present
uncertain
financial
condition
of
the
trunk
lines,
this
authority
should
not
be
granted.
the
transition
into
jets
from
propeller
aircraft
had
left
the
transatlantic
carriers
in
a
situation
where
their
financial
situation
was
not
yet
nearly
as
solidified
as
it
later
became.
but
this
issue
again
then
became
presented
in
the
supplemental
service
proceeding
which
was
initiated
in
1963
under
the
amended
act.
the
examiner's
recommended
decision
after
lengthy
contested
proceedings
concluded
that
the
supplemental
should
be
authorized
to
charter
aircraft,
to
tour
operators
for
their
use
in
package
tours
which
as
i
mentioned
before
include
hotel
accommodations,
ground
transportation,
and
usually
many
other
items.
the
board
issued
a
careful
opinion
in
the
supplementary
proceeding
which
considered
and
rejected
the
contentions
of
respondents
brief,
and
accepted
the
examiner's
recommendations
in
almost
every
respect.
i
invite
the
court's
particular
attention
to
the
portion
of
the
board's
opinion
beginning
at
page
336(a)
of
the
appendix
in
the
supplementary
proceeding.
and
again
in
the
transatlantic
proceeding
which
was
decided
later,
the
portion
of
the
board's
opinion
beginning
at
1063(a)
of
the
record.
the
board
concluded
that
inclusive
tour
charters
and
arrangements
fall
within
the
customary
meaning
of
chartered
trips.
it
drew
a
clear
distinction
between
scheduled
point-to-point
transportation
and
packaged
tours
where
a
tour
operator
organizes
a
group
of
people
willing
to
accept
certain
rigidities
and
itinerary
to
achieve
an
overall
saving
and
particularly
in
the
situation
with
foreign
tourists
to
avoid
the
trouble
of
making
separate
arrangements.
the
board
found
that
such
inclusive
tour
charters
would
meet
a
substantial
public
need
for
relatively
low
cost
pleasure
tours
which
was
not
then
being
satisfied.
and
then
it
would
do
so
without
an
adverse
effect
upon
the
scheduled
service
of
the
trunk
lines.
the
board
then
issued
regulations
which
mr.
scoutt
will
discuss
in
more
detail
to
assure
that
this
authority
could
not
be
used
as
simply
a
disguise
or
a
sham
for
individual
ticketing
point-to-point
operations.
they
included
such
requirements
as
a
minimum
price
of
a
110%
of
the
lowest
schedule
airline
fare,
a
requirement
of
at
least
three
stops
and
many
other
things
which
would
make
this
kind
of
tour
thoroughly
impractical
from
the
standpoint
of
the
business
traveler
or
one
who
is
going
for
personal
affairs
to
a
particular
point
at
a
particular
time.
now
the
board
certified
these
supplemental
carriers
on
a
temporary
basis.
it
recognized
that
this
was
an
experimental
program
as
its
opinions
reflected
drew
upon
british
air
tour
experience.
it
drew
upon
icc
experience
in
the
motor
carrier
field.
and
it
assured
the
industry
that
if
further
regulations
were
needed,
if
there
was
more
protection
needed
for
the
schedule
carriers.
the
regulations
could
be
amended
to
provide
it
but
it
expressed
every
confidence
that
this
could
be
achieved
and
that
new
markets,
new
interest
of
people
that
would
otherwise
not
travel
either
because
of
the
expense
or
because
of
their
lack
of
sophistication
and
how
to
make
arrangements
for
themselves
would
be
generated
by
this
innovative
development.
it
was
innovative
that
is
as
far
as
the
u.s.
air
transportation
business
was
concerned.
as
i
say
it
was
not
innovated
as
far
as
either
british
air
transportation
or
u.s.
surface
transportation,
and
they
have
been
added
as
i
mentioned
before
as
early
as
1961
to
the
list
of
questions
to
be
considered
by
the
board.
now
turning
now
to
the
1962
statute
itself,
there's
nothing
on
the
fix
of
that
statute
that
even
suggests
that
the
board
acted
beyond
its
authority
in
authorizing
this
kind
of
supplemental
program.
on
the
contrary,
its
authorization
were
and
the
words
of
the
statute
for
charter,
trips,
and
air
transportation
in
both
its
opinion
and
its
regulations.
the
board
clearly
limited
its
grants
to
inclusive
tour
charters
which
would
supplement
the
schedule
of
service
of
the
route
carriers
rather
than
disrupt
or
divert
it.
the
only
question
therefore
is
whether
the
legislative
history
of
these
1962
amendments
limits
a
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
principal
issue
posed
to
congress
in
1962
was
whether
the
supplemental
should
be
restricted
to
charter
service,
or
whether
they
should
be
permitted
to
engage
in
a
limited
amount
of
individually
ticketed
transportation
as
they
had
raised.
the
bill
passed
by
the
senate
would
have
allowed
them
both
to
engage
in
charter
and
in
limited
point-to-point
service.
on
point-to-point
service,
the
cab
was
required
to
prevent
any
significant
diversion
from
a
regular
carrier.
no
such
limitations
were
required
for
charter
service.
the
senate
bill
defined
charter
service
as
the
engaging
of
the
entire
capacity
of
an
aircraft.
but
the
definition
excluded
individual
ticketing
but
expressly
included
inclusive
tour
charters.
the
senate
committee
report
made
it
clear
that
it
did
not
intend
to
permit
individually
ticketed
service
to
be
offered
under
the
guise
of
a
charter
by
either
an
air
carrier
or
a
travel
agent.
it
then
noted
however
that
an
all
expense
pay
group
tour
could
be
offered
to
individual
members
of
the
public
and
still
conform
to
the
traditional
concept
of
charter.
the
report
stressed
that
if
a
travel
agent
charters
an
aircraft
and
offers
the
public
a
chance
to
participate
as
members
of
the
group.
this
is
a
very
different
sort
of
service
from
individually
ticketed
transportation.
the
house
bill,
unlike
the
senate,
did
not
allow
the
supplementals
to
engage
in
any
individual
ticketed
point-to-point
service,
nor
did
it
define
chartered
trips.
it
simply
defined
supplemental
air
transportation
as
charter
trips
and
air
transportation
to
supplement
the
schedule
of
service
offered
by
the
regular
carriers.
and
this
is
the
language
that
the
congress
adopted
when
it
enacted
the
1962
amendments.
it's
particularly
important
therefore
to
note
the
meaning
here
also
of
the
house
committee
report
on
this
bill.
and
it
explained
very
carefully
the
reason
for
omitting
a
definition
of
the
term
charter
even
though
the
senate
bill
which
had
already
been
reported
out
by
the
committee
and
the
senate
reported
and
discussed
all
of
these
matters
would
have
included
such
a
definition.
the
house
omitted
it
because
and
i
quote
again
authority
to
define
charter
services
should
be
left
as
at
present
with
the
board,
subject
to
the
limitations
contained
in
the
reported
bill.
this
is
a
very
difficult
subject
and
any
effort
to
freeze
a
definition
of
charter
service
in
the
law
could
well
lead
to
complications.
the
report
made
it
very
clear
that
the
committee
expected
the
cab
to
use
this
flexible
authority
in
a
way
which
would
protect
the
schedule
of
carriers
against
unfair
or
discriminatory
competition
from
individually
ticketed
service.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
that's
the
report
of
the
house
committee
on
interstate
foreign
commerce.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
the
chairman
of
the
committee
was
mr.
oren
harris
of
arkansas.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
yes,
sir,
he
later
remarked
on
the
floor.
this
report
made
it
clear
--
the
report
said
nothing
which
would
restrict
the
board
in
anyone
from
authorizing
any
kind
of
charter
services
which
it
determined
would
result
in
unfair
competition
or
a
detriment
to
the
schedule
of
carriers.
and
when
the
two
bills
went
to
conference,
the
conference
committee
adopted
the
court
provisions
of
the
house
bill.
this
resulted
of
course
in
cutting
out
the
senate
definition
of
charter
who
had
been
utterly
inconsistent
with
the
idea
of
leaving
flexibility
to
the
board
to
define
the
term,
to
go
ahead
and
include
any
definition
here.
it's
important
i
think
to
note
though
that
with
this
whole
inclusive
tour
charter
completely
called
its
attention,
the
committee
report
and
the
house
bill
did
nothing
to
exclude
it.
now
since
this
report
--
since
the
conference
report
gave
no
explanation
for
its
adoption
of
the
house
version
on
this
point.
so
i
think
the
only
fair
conclusion
is
that
it
intended
to
adopt
the
meeting
as
expressed
in
the
house
report.
and
that
bill
unmistakably
left
the
cab,
the
flexible
authority
to
define
charters.
we
have
then
the
following
situation.
two
bills
came
into
the
conference
committee.
the
senate
bill,
which
would
expressly
authorize
the
cab
to
grant
certificates
permitting
inclusive
tour
charters,
and
the
house
bill
which
would
leave
the
cab
with
flexibility
to
authorize
inclusive
tour
charters.
it
seems
utterly
anomalous
to
us,
to
assert
that
by
choosing
between
these
two
provisions
without
--
the
conference
committee
somehow
intended
to
deprive
the
cab
of
authority
which
it
would
have
had
under
either
bill.
when
the
committee
history
is
this
clear
cut
when
no
amendments
were
made
following
the
conference
committee
report,
it's
difficult
to
see
how
comments
made
individual
congressmen,
when
there's
no
showing
of
who
was
on
the
authority
here
can
be
permitted
to
contravene
in
this
history
under
any
accepted
theory
of
legislative
interpretation.
the
board
should
not
be
thus
deprived
of
authority
which
it
feels
it
must
have,
if
it
is
to
be
able
to
meet
the
changing
needs
and
conditions
of
this
rapidly
evolving
industry
and
carry
out
the
policies
entrusted
to
it
by
section
102
of
the
federal
aviation
act.
i
will
now
yield
to
mr.
scoutt.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
pan
american,
twa,
and
american
airlines,
the
respondents
in
this
case,
all
oppose
this.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
civil
aeronautics
board,
the
supplemental
air
carriers,
and
the
american
society
of
travel
agents.
we
might
say
everybody
except
the
trunk
airlines
who
are
respondents
or
the
other
trunk
airlines,
i'm
sure
there's
some
other
trunk
airlines
who
were
parties
to
the
domestic
proceeding
and
are
not
parties
here
who
have
more
than
passing
interest
in
the
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
they
are
for
it.
yes
sir.
thank
you.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
i'll
be
delighted
to
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
what
the
conference
committee
report
does
is
adopt
the
provisions
of
the
house
bill.
adopt
the
provision
of
the
house
amendments
this
is
on
page
200
(b)
mr.
justice
of
this
portion
that
you're
looking
at.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
starting
on
page
199
(b)
he
said
“under
the
house
amendment
the
term
supplemental
air
transportation
did
not
include
individually
ticketed
and
way
bill
services.
therefore
supplemental
carriers
could
not
engage
in
such
service
on
a
permanent
basis
and
then
in
the
senate
amendments
such
terms
didn't
include
individually
ticketing
services
and
therefore
such
carriers
could
have
engaged
in
such
services
on
a
permanent
basis.”
i
think
there
several
--
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
then,
then
the
--
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
--
then
the
substance
that
you
agreed
to
in
conference
adopts
the
provisions
of
the
house
amendment
with
respect
to
the
prohibition
of
individually
ticketed
and
way
bill
services
on
a
permanent
basis.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
now
in
the
senate
bill,
mr.
chief
justice
there
was
a
provision
which
would
have
authorized
the
board
to
grant
individual
ticketing
authority
to
supplemental
airlines
under
such
conditions
that
is
it
considered
reasonable
and
adequate
protection
to
the
trunk
line
carriers.
now
that
--
we're
not
really
talking
about
that
here.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
quite
a
part
from
a
charter
mr.
justice
and
as
i
mentioned
yesterday
i
think
that
respondent
miss
conceives
the
issue
here
when
they
keep
arguing
about
whether
individually
ticketed
services
can
be
chartered.
here
we
have
a
charter
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
there
is
a
charter.
it's
between
the
supplemental
airlines
and
the
tour
operator.
the
great
distinction
that
responded
would
have
you
withdraw
is
between
a
charter
to
a
tour
operator
and
a
charter
to
a
group.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
absolutely
correct
as
early
as
1961
as
i
mention
yesterday
on
page
646
(a)
of
a
record.
the
board
in
considering
the
issues
in
this
case
rejected
the
idea
of
the
supplemental,
that
they
should
be
able
to
sell
tours
themselves
but
said
“as
long
as
there's
a
charter
to
a
travel
agent
it's
alright
because
that's
a
charter.”
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
i
agree
with
that
completely
mr.
justice
except
i'm
afraid
respondent
doesn't
regard
the
issue
as
solely
one
of
administration
and
i'm
afraid
we
can't
read
the
second
circuit
opinion
as
leaving
it
to
be
one
of
administration.
now,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
in
its
interpretation
of
the
same
history
did
leave
it
to
be
a
question
of
sound
interpretation
by
the
board
and
that
is
what
we
think
the
issue
ought
to
be
and
when
the
statute
--
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
i
think
the
--
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
yes
sir
and,
and
who
sold
at
tickets
not
as
a
subterfuge,
but
under
very
careful
regulations
by
the
board
that
keep
it
--
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
that's
right.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
yes.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
so
i
don't
think
you
need
to
reach
this
other
area
now.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
now
i
do
believe
though
that
we
have
--
the
question
is
whether
we
have
the
difficulty
with
the
second
circuit
decision.
obviously
we
have
difficulty.
not
only
with
its
result
but
also
with
its
reason
because
the
reach
of
its
reasoning
goes
indefinitely
beyond
the
facts
before
it.
in
the
very
brief
time
i
have
remaining
i'd
like
if
i
may
to
concentrate
on
two
points.
first
the
zone
of
monopoly
protection
which
the
scheduled
carriers
are
entitled
to
receive
and
second
the
precarious
consequences
of
giving
controlling
weight
to
floor
statements
especially
when
their
inconsistent
with
committee
reports.
now
obviously
the
scheduled
airlines
are
protected
from
competition
in
the
field
of
regularly
schedules
service.
but
respondent's
counsel
has
made
it
clear
that
the
heart
of
this
case
is
that
he
wants
you
to
keep
the
supplemental
carriers
out
of
the
schedule
carrier's
field,
his
private
preserve
now
he
thinks.
and
the
real
question
is
whether
this
monopoly
protection
should
be
extended
to
include
the
field
of
package
tours
unless
there
happens
to
be
a
pre-existing
group
involved
and
that's
the
issue.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
yes
sir
and
that
as
i
mention
as
the
second
point
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
yes
sir,
well
when
you
--
congress
was
doing
so
and
when
you
interpreted
what
congress
did
the
necessary
consequence
of
this
court's
decision
is
that
it
will
define
the
perimeters
of
this
zone.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
absolutely
mr.
justice
and
i
will
come
to
that
in
a
moment.
respondents
admit
that
the
supplemental
can
charter
planes
to
such
massive
and
bona
fide
groups
as
the
elks,
or
the
rotary
or
the
federal
bar
association.
it
may
insist
though
that
a
different
rule
ought
to
apply
when
the
groups
organize
by
tour
operator
and
its
affinity
comes
not
from
membership
in
a
general
group
but
interest
in
the
same
itinerary
and
activities,
the
group
travel
experience.
now
the
charter
definition
that
the
compromise
that
the
congress
reached
was
certainly
to
leave
chartering
to
the
supplementals
and
to
leave
to
the
to
the
schedule
carrier
individually
ticketed
services.
but
we
submit
that
this
is
a
charter
and
that
a
basic
part
of
that
compromise
was
that
the
congress
left
to
the
board
the
definition
of
charter.
and
then
in
house
committee
report,
which
i
think
must
be
read
into
the
conference
committee
report.
there
is
a
clear
statement
on
page
42
(b)
of
the
record
that
the
--
they
should
--
the
definition
should
not
be
frozen
and
that
the
board
should
have
authority
to
define
the
term
subject
to
the
limitations
contained
in
the
reported
bill.
there
is
no
limitation
in
the
reported
bill.
there
is
no
limitation
in
either
the
house
or
the
senate
report
which
even
comes
close
to
refusing
the
board
the
authority
to
grant
this
kind
of
charter.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
no
sir
because
that
would
not
be
a
charter.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
individually
ticketed
plans
themselves
because
they're
not
charters.
now
they
can
sell
the
groups,
and
groups
can
have
the
plan
have,
have
the
tours.
but
they
--
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
i
beg
your
pardon?
previous
--
yes
sir
that's
right
and
that's
all.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
yes
sir
exactly.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
for
the
purposes
of
a
pleasure
tour
for
all
an
inclusive
tour
or
at
least
a
tour
which
includes
hotel
and
ground
transportation.
now
in
view
of
this
little
light
i
see
here,
i'm
going
to
turn
to
my
second
point
quickly
if
i
may.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
when
the
senate
receded
in
the
conference
committee
it
did
not
recede
from
both
the
senate
and
the
house
bill.
but
from
the
senate
bill
to
the
house
bill
to
receive
from
an
insistence
that
inclusive
tour
charters
be
treated
as
charters
as
in
the
senate
bill
does
not
mean
to
recede
from
permitting
the
cab
to
treat
bona
fide
tourist
as
charters
under
careful
regulation
which
the
house
bill
did,
and
until
the
very
day
of
its
passage
by
the
senate
and
the
house.
there
was
no
question
at
the
bill
adopted
by
the
congress
committee.
congress
committee
would
clearly
have
supported
the
board's
flexible
authority
to
grant
this
kind
of
authority
to
the
supplementals.
now
for
statement
on
the
day
of
a
vote
has
an
eminent
--
has
an
inherent
weakness
no
matter
how
important
the
congressman
who
makes
it.
it
simply
has
not
been
through
the
sifting
and
testing
process
of
language
in
a
committee
report.
it's
only
available
to
those
congressmen
who
happen
to
be
on
the
floor
in
the
chamber
at
the
time
and
happen
to
be
listening.
when
there
is
a
committee
report
then
you
can
have
it
distributed
and
the
congressman
at
least
have
a
shot
at
looking
at
it
their
constituents
can
see
it
and
maybe
advised
concerning
them.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
well
sir
if
was
distributed
the
day
before
i
don't
know
when
it
meant
because
the
record
doesn't
show
that
but
the
report
was
issued
on
june
28
and
--
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
the
very
next
day
sir.
and
i
submit
that
that
report
at
least
was
available
to
these
people.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
yes
sir
it
was
dated
the
day
before.
now
perhaps
the
conference
report
should
have
been
out
sooner
but
at
least
they
had
seen
the
house
committee
report
mr.
justice,
long
before
that.
they'd
seen
the
house
bill
and
they
knew
that
the
conference
committee
was
adopting
the
house
bill.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
gave
them
a
warning
where
is
there
is
no
way
to
cab
or
the
supplementals
or
the
travel
agents
or
the
congressmen
who
might
have
support
them,
would
have
the
slightest
idea
that
this
kind
of
statement
was
going
to
be
made
on
the
floor
five
minutes
before
a
vote
which
could
be
made
in
the
house
only
after
a
call
for
a
forum
and
was
made
in
the
senate
with
no
roll
call
or
anything
else.
and
we
believe
frankly
that
this
is
a
dangerous
principle
of
statutory
interpretation.
there
maybe
room
for
giving
some
weight
to
floor
statements
when
the
committee
reports
are
ambiguous,
where
the
bill
is
ambiguous,
where
the
statement
are
tested
by
real
debate.
in
this
case
there
is
no
ambiguity
in
the
bill
or
in
the
reports.
clearly,
there
was
no
debate.
the
hard
realities
of
the
legislative
process
should
keep
this
court
from
establishing
any
doctrine
of
statutory
interpretation
that
permits
floor
statements
under
these
circumstances
even
by
committee
chairman
to
alter
or
in
graft
additional
provision
onto
an
already
clear
bill
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
alright
thank
you
sir.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board,
petitioner
in
number
946.
the
petitioner
in
the
other
two
cases
was
consolidated
here
for
oral
argument.
our
six
supplemental
air
carriers
in
number
800,
and
the
american
society
of
travel
agents
in
number
969,
and
the
argument
on
their
behalf
will
be
presented
by
mr.
jerrold
scoutt,
with
whom
i
will
share
petitioner's
time.
in
all
three
cases,
the
respondents
are
pan
american,
twa,
and
american
airlines,
regularly
schedule
trunk
carriers.
these
cases
are
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
that
court
struck
down
and
has
begun
the
cab
statutory
authority.
several
related
orders
which
certified
supplemental
air
carriers
to
engage
in
inclusive
tour
charters
involving
foreign
transportation.
this
decision
is
in
direct
conflict
with
the
prior
decision
of
the
u.s.court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
which
had
affirmed
cab
orders,
authorizing
inclusive
tour
charters
in
the
domestic
market.
american
airlines
versus
cab
which
is
reported
at
365
f.2d
939,
and
is
included
as
an
appendix
to
the
petition
for
the
supplemental
carriers.
these
two
decisions
were
based
on
the
same
provisions
of
a
1962
statute,
amending
the
federal
aviation
act,
sections
401
subsection
(d)
and
(e)
and
101(32)
and
(33)
of
that
act.
they
involved
orders
issued
in
the
same
proceeding,
the
supplemental
air
service
proceeding
which
had
begun
in
1963.
they
we're
not
these
--
orders
were
not
separated
on
appeal
because
the
domestic
orders
did
not
require
presidential
approval.
and
that
to
the
domestic
orders
were
appealed
by
the
trunk
lines,
and
upheld
by
the
d.c.
circuit.
the
orders
involving
foreign
transportation,
received
the
necessary
presidential
approval
in
september
of
1966
along
with
additional
orders,
issued
in
the
trans-atlantic
proceeding
of
the
board,
in
which
the
inclusive
tour
phase
had
been
reopened
in
1965.
after
the
hearing
examiner's
report
in
the
supplemental
proceeding,
the
trunk
lines
did
not
ask
this
court
to
review
the
district
of
columbia
decision
which
became
final.
instead,
they
appealed
to
the
second
circuit
from
the
cab
orders
involving
foreign
tours.
thus
while
only
foreign
tourists
were
involved
in
this
case,
this
court's
decision
on
the
merits,
well
obviously,
controlled
domestic
tours
as
well.
moreover,
a
decision
limiting
the
board's
power
here
could
also
cast
a
serious
cloud
on
a
1965
decision
by
a
different
panel
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals,
the
so-called
split
charter
decision.
american
airlines
versus
cab
which
is
recorded
at
348
f.2d,
349.
that
case
held
that
the
board
had
authority
under
the
1962
amendments
to
define
charter
so
as
to
permit
the
supplementals
to
split
the
charter
of
one
plane
between
two
groups.
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
relied
on
that
case
and
cited
it
and
quoted
from
it,
in
reaching
his
decision
here.
in
my
statement,
i
will
attempt
to
discuss
the
principal
issue
in
this
case,
the
essential
facts,
and
the
background
and
history
of
the
1962
amendments
through
the
conference
report
stage
where
it
was
presented
to
the
congress
in
the
form
in
which
it
was
enacted.
mr.
scoutt
will
deal
with
certain
statements
made
by
members
of
congress
when
the
conference
committee
report
reached
the
floor.
he
will
also
discuss
the
general
role
of
the
supplemental
carriers
in
the
air
transportation
industry,
and
certain
procedural
objections
of
respondent
to
some
of
board's
orders
which
were
not
reached
below.
in
our
view,
the
principal
issue
here
is
one
of
the
board's
expressed
authority
under
the
1962
statute,
to
permit
charter
trips
by
supplemental
air
carriers,
is
restricted
by
the
act's
legislative
history
to
exclude
charters
to
tour
operators
who
organize
group
tours
including
more
than
just
air
transportation.
a
respondent's
brief
seeks
at
its
beginning
to
shift
the
emphasis
to
whether
inclusive
tour
arrangements
can
be
considered
as
charters.
but
the
inclusive
tours
authorized
by
the
cab
under
the
contested
orders
are
clearly
based
on
a
contract
between
a
carrier
and
a
tour
operator
acting
as
principal
not
agent,
which
is
a
charter
within
every
accepted
meaning
of
the
term.
the
tour
operator
is
an
independent
contractor.
he
pays
a
single
price
to
the
aircraft
on
a
time,
trip,
or
mileage
basis.
the
economic
risk
is
entirely
his
no
matter
how
many
or
how
few
passengers
are
actually
carried,
he
pays,
and
the
supplemental
carrier
receives
the
same
lump
sum
price
for
the
charter.
in
our
view,
this
concept
comes
squarely
within
the
authority
of
the
board
under
the
1962
amendments.
that
legislation
climaxed
years
of
controversy
as
to
the
place
of
the
nonscheduled
or
supplemental
carriers
as
they're
now
called
in
the
transportation
industry.
its
basic
purpose
was
to
establish
a
stable
and
useful
role
for
that
creative
segment
of
the
industry,
without
jeopardizing
the
regularly
scheduled
carriers.
in
our
brief
at
pages
9
through
12
discusses
that
history
as
to
the
opinions
of
both
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
he
can
offer
them
to
anybody
he
wishes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
correct,
sir.
this
is
a
difference
between
this
and
another
provision
whereby
the
supplemental
carriers
themselves
can
charter
the
plane
to
groups
where
there
is
a
preexisting
connection.
in
the
case
of
the
tour
operator,
however,
no
such
connection
is
required
but
he
cannot
split
a
charter
with
any
other
tour
operator.
he
has
to
take
the
whole
plane.
and
the
group
is
formed
by
the
choice
of
the
itinerary
which
he
offers.
affinity
in
the
view
of
the
board
is
provided
by
the
fact
that
these
people
are
all
signing
up
for
the
same
itinerary.
and
in
doing
that
they
accept
of
course,
considerable
rigidities
as
the
board
and
courts
recognized.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
no,
it
may
not.
let
me
say
this,
sir.
it
may
as
far
as
the
contract
with
the
supplemental
carrier
is
concerned.
but
the
board
requires
a
prior
authorization
of
each
of
these
chartered
trips.
and
the
tour
operator
must
submit
a
filing
to
the
board
along
with
the
airline.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
he
must
include
at
least
hotel
reservations
and
ground
transportation.
in
practice,
there
are
usually
a
great
many
other
items
included.
it
also
as
always
around
trip
situation,
it
comes
on
back
to
where
it
started
i
believe.
and
so
you
have
a
package
tour,
it's
the
customary
vernacular
i
believe
in
the
travel
agent.
there's
this
where
people
sign
up
for
a
particular
package.
it
is
not
simply
point-to-point
transportation.
the
man
who
go
and
takes
that
trip
must
go
on
that
particular
plane,
at
that
particular
time.
he
does
not
have
his
choice
of
the
schedule
of
the
air
carriers
as
a
member
of
the
public
dealing
directly
with
the
airlines
would
have.
now
these
1962
amendments
attempted
to
accomplish
the
role
that
the
supplemental
carriers
should
have
in
this
industry
by
authorizing
them
to
engage
in
chartered
trips.
and
according
to
statute
now,
charter
trips
in
air
transportation
to
supplement
the
schedule
of
service.
it
did
not
authorize
them
to
provide
individually
ticketed
point-to-point
transportation.
in
previous
days
before
these
amendments,
the
supplemental
carriers
have
been
authorized
to
run
a
limited
number
of
regular
point-to-point
trips
a
month
and
this
statute,
terminated
their
authority
to
do
that
with
a
two-year
interim
delay
period
for
them
to
phase
out
on
it,
but
it
left
them
with
full
authority
to
conduct
chartered
services
as
authorized
by
the
board.
now
in
our
view,
this
provides
a
classic
example
of
a
kind
of
situation
in
which
an
administrative
agency
like
the
cab
is
best
equipped
to
operate.
recently
as
this
past
january
in
horton
versus
kentucky
utilities,
this
court
reemphasized
the
established
rule
within
questions
of
statutory
interpretation
involving
agency
authority.
the
agency's
own
determination
should
be
set
aside
only
where
it
lacks
reasonable
support
in
relation
to
the
statutory
purpose.
we
also
cited
page
23
of
our
brief,
the
several
other
cases
that
reflect
in
recent
times
as
long
established
doctrine.
now,
the
word
charter
which
we're
talking
about
defining
here
has
been
in
the
federal
aviation
act
since
it's
enactment
in
1938.
it
is
never
been
defined
in
the
act
itself,
only
by
the
board.
and
the
determination
as
to
what
kinds
of
charters
the
supplemental
airlines
should
be
permitted
to
make,
involves
exceedingly
intricate
questions
of
economic
facts
and
policies.
as
the
hearing
examiners
recommended
opinion
--
this
decision
in
his
opinion
and
the
opinions
of
both
courts,
the
second
circuit
and
the
district
of
columbia
court
both
indicate.
and
in
fact
as
early
as
1961,
the
board
added
to
the
issues
in
its
transatlantic
proceeding,
the
question
of
whether
the
supplementals
should
be
authorized
to
charter
their
aircraft
to
tour
operators
for
all
expense
tours.
and
they
pointed
out
there
in
1961
that
that
this
was
very
different
from
individual
ticketing.
this
appears
at
pages
644
through
646(a)
of
the
record.
now
this
authority
was
not
granted
by
the
board
in
the
initial
orders
in
that
proceeding.
they
determine
in
their
discretion
not
that
they
did
not
have
authority
to
do
so,
but
at
the
time
considering
the
present
uncertain
financial
condition
of
the
trunk
lines,
this
authority
should
not
be
granted.
the
transition
into
jets
from
propeller
aircraft
had
left
the
transatlantic
carriers
in
a
situation
where
their
financial
situation
was
not
yet
nearly
as
solidified
as
it
later
became.
but
this
issue
again
then
became
presented
in
the
supplemental
service
proceeding
which
was
initiated
in
1963
under
the
amended
act.
the
examiner's
recommended
decision
after
lengthy
contested
proceedings
concluded
that
the
supplemental
should
be
authorized
to
charter
aircraft,
to
tour
operators
for
their
use
in
package
tours
which
as
i
mentioned
before
include
hotel
accommodations,
ground
transportation,
and
usually
many
other
items.
the
board
issued
a
careful
opinion
in
the
supplementary
proceeding
which
considered
and
rejected
the
contentions
of
respondents
brief,
and
accepted
the
examiner's
recommendations
in
almost
every
respect.
i
invite
the
court's
particular
attention
to
the
portion
of
the
board's
opinion
beginning
at
page
336(a)
of
the
appendix
in
the
supplementary
proceeding.
and
again
in
the
transatlantic
proceeding
which
was
decided
later,
the
portion
of
the
board's
opinion
beginning
at
1063(a)
of
the
record.
the
board
concluded
that
inclusive
tour
charters
and
arrangements
fall
within
the
customary
meaning
of
chartered
trips.
it
drew
a
clear
distinction
between
scheduled
point-to-point
transportation
and
packaged
tours
where
a
tour
operator
organizes
a
group
of
people
willing
to
accept
certain
rigidities
and
itinerary
to
achieve
an
overall
saving
and
particularly
in
the
situation
with
foreign
tourists
to
avoid
the
trouble
of
making
separate
arrangements.
the
board
found
that
such
inclusive
tour
charters
would
meet
a
substantial
public
need
for
relatively
low
cost
pleasure
tours
which
was
not
then
being
satisfied.
and
then
it
would
do
so
without
an
adverse
effect
upon
the
scheduled
service
of
the
trunk
lines.
the
board
then
issued
regulations
which
mr.
scoutt
will
discuss
in
more
detail
to
assure
that
this
authority
could
not
be
used
as
simply
a
disguise
or
a
sham
for
individual
ticketing
point-to-point
operations.
they
included
such
requirements
as
a
minimum
price
of
a
110%
of
the
lowest
schedule
airline
fare,
a
requirement
of
at
least
three
stops
and
many
other
things
which
would
make
this
kind
of
tour
thoroughly
impractical
from
the
standpoint
of
the
business
traveler
or
one
who
is
going
for
personal
affairs
to
a
particular
point
at
a
particular
time.
now
the
board
certified
these
supplemental
carriers
on
a
temporary
basis.
it
recognized
that
this
was
an
experimental
program
as
its
opinions
reflected
drew
upon
british
air
tour
experience.
it
drew
upon
icc
experience
in
the
motor
carrier
field.
and
it
assured
the
industry
that
if
further
regulations
were
needed,
if
there
was
more
protection
needed
for
the
schedule
carriers.
the
regulations
could
be
amended
to
provide
it
but
it
expressed
every
confidence
that
this
could
be
achieved
and
that
new
markets,
new
interest
of
people
that
would
otherwise
not
travel
either
because
of
the
expense
or
because
of
their
lack
of
sophistication
and
how
to
make
arrangements
for
themselves
would
be
generated
by
this
innovative
development.
it
was
innovative
that
is
as
far
as
the
u.s.
air
transportation
business
was
concerned.
as
i
say
it
was
not
innovated
as
far
as
either
british
air
transportation
or
u.s.
surface
transportation,
and
they
have
been
added
as
i
mentioned
before
as
early
as
1961
to
the
list
of
questions
to
be
considered
by
the
board.
now
turning
now
to
the
1962
statute
itself,
there's
nothing
on
the
fix
of
that
statute
that
even
suggests
that
the
board
acted
beyond
its
authority
in
authorizing
this
kind
of
supplemental
program.
on
the
contrary,
its
authorization
were
and
the
words
of
the
statute
for
charter,
trips,
and
air
transportation
in
both
its
opinion
and
its
regulations.
the
board
clearly
limited
its
grants
to
inclusive
tour
charters
which
would
supplement
the
schedule
of
service
of
the
route
carriers
rather
than
disrupt
or
divert
it.
the
only
question
therefore
is
whether
the
legislative
history
of
these
1962
amendments
limits
a
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
principal
issue
posed
to
congress
in
1962
was
whether
the
supplemental
should
be
restricted
to
charter
service,
or
whether
they
should
be
permitted
to
engage
in
a
limited
amount
of
individually
ticketed
transportation
as
they
had
raised.
the
bill
passed
by
the
senate
would
have
allowed
them
both
to
engage
in
charter
and
in
limited
point-to-point
service.
on
point-to-point
service,
the
cab
was
required
to
prevent
any
significant
diversion
from
a
regular
carrier.
no
such
limitations
were
required
for
charter
service.
the
senate
bill
defined
charter
service
as
the
engaging
of
the
entire
capacity
of
an
aircraft.
but
the
definition
excluded
individual
ticketing
but
expressly
included
inclusive
tour
charters.
the
senate
committee
report
made
it
clear
that
it
did
not
intend
to
permit
individually
ticketed
service
to
be
offered
under
the
guise
of
a
charter
by
either
an
air
carrier
or
a
travel
agent.
it
then
noted
however
that
an
all
expense
pay
group
tour
could
be
offered
to
individual
members
of
the
public
and
still
conform
to
the
traditional
concept
of
charter.
the
report
stressed
that
if
a
travel
agent
charters
an
aircraft
and
offers
the
public
a
chance
to
participate
as
members
of
the
group.
this
is
a
very
different
sort
of
service
from
individually
ticketed
transportation.
the
house
bill,
unlike
the
senate,
did
not
allow
the
supplementals
to
engage
in
any
individual
ticketed
point-to-point
service,
nor
did
it
define
chartered
trips.
it
simply
defined
supplemental
air
transportation
as
charter
trips
and
air
transportation
to
supplement
the
schedule
of
service
offered
by
the
regular
carriers.
and
this
is
the
language
that
the
congress
adopted
when
it
enacted
the
1962
amendments.
it's
particularly
important
therefore
to
note
the
meaning
here
also
of
the
house
committee
report
on
this
bill.
and
it
explained
very
carefully
the
reason
for
omitting
a
definition
of
the
term
charter
even
though
the
senate
bill
which
had
already
been
reported
out
by
the
committee
and
the
senate
reported
and
discussed
all
of
these
matters
would
have
included
such
a
definition.
the
house
omitted
it
because
and
i
quote
again
authority
to
define
charter
services
should
be
left
as
at
present
with
the
board,
subject
to
the
limitations
contained
in
the
reported
bill.
this
is
a
very
difficult
subject
and
any
effort
to
freeze
a
definition
of
charter
service
in
the
law
could
well
lead
to
complications.
the
report
made
it
very
clear
that
the
committee
expected
the
cab
to
use
this
flexible
authority
in
a
way
which
would
protect
the
schedule
of
carriers
against
unfair
or
discriminatory
competition
from
individually
ticketed
service.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
that's
the
report
of
the
house
committee
on
interstate
foreign
commerce.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
the
chairman
of
the
committee
was
mr.
oren
harris
of
arkansas.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
yes,
sir,
he
later
remarked
on
the
floor.
this
report
made
it
clear
--
the
report
said
nothing
which
would
restrict
the
board
in
anyone
from
authorizing
any
kind
of
charter
services
which
it
determined
would
result
in
unfair
competition
or
a
detriment
to
the
schedule
of
carriers.
and
when
the
two
bills
went
to
conference,
the
conference
committee
adopted
the
court
provisions
of
the
house
bill.
this
resulted
of
course
in
cutting
out
the
senate
definition
of
charter
who
had
been
utterly
inconsistent
with
the
idea
of
leaving
flexibility
to
the
board
to
define
the
term,
to
go
ahead
and
include
any
definition
here.
it's
important
i
think
to
note
though
that
with
this
whole
inclusive
tour
charter
completely
called
its
attention,
the
committee
report
and
the
house
bill
did
nothing
to
exclude
it.
now
since
this
report
--
since
the
conference
report
gave
no
explanation
for
its
adoption
of
the
house
version
on
this
point.
so
i
think
the
only
fair
conclusion
is
that
it
intended
to
adopt
the
meeting
as
expressed
in
the
house
report.
and
that
bill
unmistakably
left
the
cab,
the
flexible
authority
to
define
charters.
we
have
then
the
following
situation.
two
bills
came
into
the
conference
committee.
the
senate
bill,
which
would
expressly
authorize
the
cab
to
grant
certificates
permitting
inclusive
tour
charters,
and
the
house
bill
which
would
leave
the
cab
with
flexibility
to
authorize
inclusive
tour
charters.
it
seems
utterly
anomalous
to
us,
to
assert
that
by
choosing
between
these
two
provisions
without
--
the
conference
committee
somehow
intended
to
deprive
the
cab
of
authority
which
it
would
have
had
under
either
bill.
when
the
committee
history
is
this
clear
cut
when
no
amendments
were
made
following
the
conference
committee
report,
it's
difficult
to
see
how
comments
made
individual
congressmen,
when
there's
no
showing
of
who
was
on
the
authority
here
can
be
permitted
to
contravene
in
this
history
under
any
accepted
theory
of
legislative
interpretation.
the
board
should
not
be
thus
deprived
of
authority
which
it
feels
it
must
have,
if
it
is
to
be
able
to
meet
the
changing
needs
and
conditions
of
this
rapidly
evolving
industry
and
carry
out
the
policies
entrusted
to
it
by
section
102
of
the
federal
aviation
act.
i
will
now
yield
to
mr.
scoutt.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
pan
american,
twa,
and
american
airlines,
the
respondents
in
this
case,
all
oppose
this.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
civil
aeronautics
board,
the
supplemental
air
carriers,
and
the
american
society
of
travel
agents.
we
might
say
everybody
except
the
trunk
airlines
who
are
respondents
or
the
other
trunk
airlines,
i'm
sure
there's
some
other
trunk
airlines
who
were
parties
to
the
domestic
proceeding
and
are
not
parties
here
who
have
more
than
passing
interest
in
the
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
they
are
for
it.
yes
sir.
thank
you.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
i'll
be
delighted
to
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
what
the
conference
committee
report
does
is
adopt
the
provisions
of
the
house
bill.
adopt
the
provision
of
the
house
amendments
this
is
on
page
200
(b)
mr.
justice
of
this
portion
that
you're
looking
at.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
starting
on
page
199
(b)
he
said
“under
the
house
amendment
the
term
supplemental
air
transportation
did
not
include
individually
ticketed
and
way
bill
services.
therefore
supplemental
carriers
could
not
engage
in
such
service
on
a
permanent
basis
and
then
in
the
senate
amendments
such
terms
didn't
include
individually
ticketing
services
and
therefore
such
carriers
could
have
engaged
in
such
services
on
a
permanent
basis.”
i
think
there
several
--
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
then,
then
the
--
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
--
then
the
substance
that
you
agreed
to
in
conference
adopts
the
provisions
of
the
house
amendment
with
respect
to
the
prohibition
of
individually
ticketed
and
way
bill
services
on
a
permanent
basis.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
now
in
the
senate
bill,
mr.
chief
justice
there
was
a
provision
which
would
have
authorized
the
board
to
grant
individual
ticketing
authority
to
supplemental
airlines
under
such
conditions
that
is
it
considered
reasonable
and
adequate
protection
to
the
trunk
line
carriers.
now
that
--
we're
not
really
talking
about
that
here.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
quite
a
part
from
a
charter
mr.
justice
and
as
i
mentioned
yesterday
i
think
that
respondent
miss
conceives
the
issue
here
when
they
keep
arguing
about
whether
individually
ticketed
services
can
be
chartered.
here
we
have
a
charter
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
there
is
a
charter.
it's
between
the
supplemental
airlines
and
the
tour
operator.
the
great
distinction
that
responded
would
have
you
withdraw
is
between
a
charter
to
a
tour
operator
and
a
charter
to
a
group.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
absolutely
correct
as
early
as
1961
as
i
mention
yesterday
on
page
646
(a)
of
a
record.
the
board
in
considering
the
issues
in
this
case
rejected
the
idea
of
the
supplemental,
that
they
should
be
able
to
sell
tours
themselves
but
said
“as
long
as
there's
a
charter
to
a
travel
agent
it's
alright
because
that's
a
charter.”
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
i
agree
with
that
completely
mr.
justice
except
i'm
afraid
respondent
doesn't
regard
the
issue
as
solely
one
of
administration
and
i'm
afraid
we
can't
read
the
second
circuit
opinion
as
leaving
it
to
be
one
of
administration.
now,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
in
its
interpretation
of
the
same
history
did
leave
it
to
be
a
question
of
sound
interpretation
by
the
board
and
that
is
what
we
think
the
issue
ought
to
be
and
when
the
statute
--
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
i
think
the
--
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
yes
sir
and,
and
who
sold
at
tickets
not
as
a
subterfuge,
but
under
very
careful
regulations
by
the
board
that
keep
it
--
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
that's
right.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
yes.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
so
i
don't
think
you
need
to
reach
this
other
area
now.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
now
i
do
believe
though
that
we
have
--
the
question
is
whether
we
have
the
difficulty
with
the
second
circuit
decision.
obviously
we
have
difficulty.
not
only
with
its
result
but
also
with
its
reason
because
the
reach
of
its
reasoning
goes
indefinitely
beyond
the
facts
before
it.
in
the
very
brief
time
i
have
remaining
i'd
like
if
i
may
to
concentrate
on
two
points.
first
the
zone
of
monopoly
protection
which
the
scheduled
carriers
are
entitled
to
receive
and
second
the
precarious
consequences
of
giving
controlling
weight
to
floor
statements
especially
when
their
inconsistent
with
committee
reports.
now
obviously
the
scheduled
airlines
are
protected
from
competition
in
the
field
of
regularly
schedules
service.
but
respondent's
counsel
has
made
it
clear
that
the
heart
of
this
case
is
that
he
wants
you
to
keep
the
supplemental
carriers
out
of
the
schedule
carrier's
field,
his
private
preserve
now
he
thinks.
and
the
real
question
is
whether
this
monopoly
protection
should
be
extended
to
include
the
field
of
package
tours
unless
there
happens
to
be
a
pre-existing
group
involved
and
that's
the
issue.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
yes
sir
and
that
as
i
mention
as
the
second
point
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
yes
sir,
well
when
you
--
congress
was
doing
so
and
when
you
interpreted
what
congress
did
the
necessary
consequence
of
this
court's
decision
is
that
it
will
define
the
perimeters
of
this
zone.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
absolutely
mr.
justice
and
i
will
come
to
that
in
a
moment.
respondents
admit
that
the
supplemental
can
charter
planes
to
such
massive
and
bona
fide
groups
as
the
elks,
or
the
rotary
or
the
federal
bar
association.
it
may
insist
though
that
a
different
rule
ought
to
apply
when
the
groups
organize
by
tour
operator
and
its
affinity
comes
not
from
membership
in
a
general
group
but
interest
in
the
same
itinerary
and
activities,
the
group
travel
experience.
now
the
charter
definition
that
the
compromise
that
the
congress
reached
was
certainly
to
leave
chartering
to
the
supplementals
and
to
leave
to
the
to
the
schedule
carrier
individually
ticketed
services.
but
we
submit
that
this
is
a
charter
and
that
a
basic
part
of
that
compromise
was
that
the
congress
left
to
the
board
the
definition
of
charter.
and
then
in
house
committee
report,
which
i
think
must
be
read
into
the
conference
committee
report.
there
is
a
clear
statement
on
page
42
(b)
of
the
record
that
the
--
they
should
--
the
definition
should
not
be
frozen
and
that
the
board
should
have
authority
to
define
the
term
subject
to
the
limitations
contained
in
the
reported
bill.
there
is
no
limitation
in
the
reported
bill.
there
is
no
limitation
in
either
the
house
or
the
senate
report
which
even
comes
close
to
refusing
the
board
the
authority
to
grant
this
kind
of
charter.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
no
sir
because
that
would
not
be
a
charter.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
individually
ticketed
plans
themselves
because
they're
not
charters.
now
they
can
sell
the
groups,
and
groups
can
have
the
plan
have,
have
the
tours.
but
they
--
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
i
beg
your
pardon?
previous
--
yes
sir
that's
right
and
that's
all.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
yes
sir
exactly.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
for
the
purposes
of
a
pleasure
tour
for
all
an
inclusive
tour
or
at
least
a
tour
which
includes
hotel
and
ground
transportation.
now
in
view
of
this
little
light
i
see
here,
i'm
going
to
turn
to
my
second
point
quickly
if
i
may.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
when
the
senate
receded
in
the
conference
committee
it
did
not
recede
from
both
the
senate
and
the
house
bill.
but
from
the
senate
bill
to
the
house
bill
to
receive
from
an
insistence
that
inclusive
tour
charters
be
treated
as
charters
as
in
the
senate
bill
does
not
mean
to
recede
from
permitting
the
cab
to
treat
bona
fide
tourist
as
charters
under
careful
regulation
which
the
house
bill
did,
and
until
the
very
day
of
its
passage
by
the
senate
and
the
house.
there
was
no
question
at
the
bill
adopted
by
the
congress
committee.
congress
committee
would
clearly
have
supported
the
board's
flexible
authority
to
grant
this
kind
of
authority
to
the
supplementals.
now
for
statement
on
the
day
of
a
vote
has
an
eminent
--
has
an
inherent
weakness
no
matter
how
important
the
congressman
who
makes
it.
it
simply
has
not
been
through
the
sifting
and
testing
process
of
language
in
a
committee
report.
it's
only
available
to
those
congressmen
who
happen
to
be
on
the
floor
in
the
chamber
at
the
time
and
happen
to
be
listening.
when
there
is
a
committee
report
then
you
can
have
it
distributed
and
the
congressman
at
least
have
a
shot
at
looking
at
it
their
constituents
can
see
it
and
maybe
advised
concerning
them.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
well
sir
if
was
distributed
the
day
before
i
don't
know
when
it
meant
because
the
record
doesn't
show
that
but
the
report
was
issued
on
june
28
and
--
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
the
very
next
day
sir.
and
i
submit
that
that
report
at
least
was
available
to
these
people.
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
yes
sir
it
was
dated
the
day
before.
now
perhaps
the
conference
report
should
have
been
out
sooner
but
at
least
they
had
seen
the
house
committee
report
mr.
justice,
long
before
that.
they'd
seen
the
house
bill
and
they
knew
that
the
conference
committee
was
adopting
the
house
bill.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
gave
them
a
warning
where
is
there
is
no
way
to
cab
or
the
supplementals
or
the
travel
agents
or
the
congressmen
who
might
have
support
them,
would
have
the
slightest
idea
that
this
kind
of
statement
was
going
to
be
made
on
the
floor
five
minutes
before
a
vote
which
could
be
made
in
the
house
only
after
a
call
for
a
forum
and
was
made
in
the
senate
with
no
roll
call
or
anything
else.
and
we
believe
frankly
that
this
is
a
dangerous
principle
of
statutory
interpretation.
there
maybe
room
for
giving
some
weight
to
floor
statements
when
the
committee
reports
are
ambiguous,
where
the
bill
is
ambiguous,
where
the
statement
are
tested
by
real
debate.
in
this
case
there
is
no
ambiguity
in
the
bill
or
in
the
reports.
clearly,
there
was
no
debate.
the
hard
realities
of
the
legislative
process
should
keep
this
court
from
establishing
any
doctrine
of
statutory
interpretation
that
permits
floor
statements
under
these
circumstances
even
by
committee
chairman
to
alter
or
in
graft
additional
provision
onto
an
already
clear
bill
mr.
frank
m.
wozencraft
alright
thank
you
sir.
