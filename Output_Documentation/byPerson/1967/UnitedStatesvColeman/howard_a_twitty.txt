mr.
howard
a.
twitty
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court?
the
issues
in
this
case
involve
18
cluster
mining
claims
which
were
located
during
the
years
1949
through
1950.
they
were
located
pursuant
to
the
building
stone
law,
which
is
30
u.s.c.
161.
and
that
law
enacted
in
1892
provides
that
“lands
that
are
chiefly
valuable
for
building
stone,
may
be
located
under
the
law
(relating
to
cluster
mining
claims).”
in
1958,
the
contest
was
filed
in
this
case.
the
contest
complaint
has
three
charges,
three
grounds
for
seeking
to
hold
these
claims
invalid.
the
first
ground
was
that
there
was
--
the
lands
embraced
within
the
claims
are
non-mineral
in
character.
now,
in
the
evidence
in
this
case
and
both
the
hearing
examiners,
and
i
believe
even
in
the
brief
of
the
government,
it's
stated,
it's
agreed
that
this
land
is
chiefly
valuable
for
building
stone.
the
evidence
in
your
case
shows
that
that's
the
only
use
that
the
land
could
be
put.
there's
no
other
--
there
was
no
testimony
that
it
could
be
used
for
any
other
purpose.
so
on
that
charge
was
met
and
there's
no
controverting
evidence
whatsoever
on
that.
the
second
charge
in
the
contest
was
that
minerals
have
not
been
found
within
the
limits
of
the
claims
in
sufficient
quantities
to
constitute
a
valid
discovery.
as
mr.
barry
has
pointed
out,
the
evidence
is
clear
that
on
the
--
in
these
claims,
these
cluster
mining
claims
and
in
the
surrounding
area,
there
is
building
stone
to
a
depth
of
a
thousand
feet.
so
that
charge
is
simply
met.
there's
just
no
evidence
that
minerals
have
not
been
found
in
sufficient
quantities
to
constitute
a
valid
discovery.
the
third
charge
related
to
the
amount
of
work
required
on
each
claim
is
$500
worth
of
work
and
they
said
that
on
ten
of
the
claims,
there
had
not
been
$500
worth
of
work.
the
hearing
examiner
found
that,
as
to
five
of
the
claims,
mr.
coleman
had
established
the
market
and
held
five
valid.
both
sides
appealed
and
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
land
management
said
three
claims
and
part
of
the
fourth
were
valid
and
then
it
goes
to
the
secretary
and
the
secretary
decides,
as
i
read
his
decision,
and
this
was
the
decision
written
by
the
deputy
solicitor
for
the
department
as
he's
authorized
under
their
regulations.
the
decision
was
that,
“because
this
stone
is
a
common
variety,
and
because
coleman
had
not
demonstrated
the
market
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
common
varieties
act,
july
the
23rd
1955,
all
of
the
mining
claims
were
invalid”.
now,
the
--
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
your
honor,
we
have
pointed
out
that
under
the
building
stone
law,
it
says
that
“you
can
locate
and
you
can
go
on
the
lands,
enter
the
lands
for
lands
chiefly
valuable
for
building
stone.
we
say
that
on
that
alone,
we
should
be
entitled
to
a
patent.
if
--
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
chief;
it
says
“chiefly”
valuable.
now,
let
me
answer
that
question
a
little
more
fully,
if
i
may.
we
have
pointed
out
that
if
that
is
not
the
rule
-
there
are
no
laws
or
cases
–
and
i
might
state
that
there
interior
decisions
that
are
adverse
to
that
position,
but
our
position
is
that
if
the
law
of
discovery
is
the
applicable
law
under
section
30
u.s.c.
section
22,
i
mean
title
xxx
u.s.c.
section
22,
it
speaks
of
a
valuable
mineral
deposit.
and
in
castle
versus
womble,
which
is
the
case
this
court
has
--
where
an
early
land
department's
decision
which
this
court
has
followed
as
recently
as
in
best
versus
humboldt
placer
mining
company,
this
court
said
that
what
that
means,
“is
there
a
valuable
deposit?”
is,
it's
the
prudent-man
test
whether
that
would
justify
a
man
going
on
the
claims
with
a
reasonable
expectation
of
working
the
claims
and
eventually,
into
some
sort
of
a
mining
venture.
it
is
our
position
--
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
if
the
court
rules
that
--
our
argument
that
just
showing
building
stone
chiefly
valuable,
i
mean
the
lands
chiefly
valuable
for
building
stone
is
enough
to
obtain
patent.
if
the
court
disagrees
with
that
position,
then
i
say
that
that
is
the
prudent-man
test
in
the
construction
of
section
30
u.s.c.
22
as
the
applicable
test.
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
we
have
urged
that
that
is
a
proper
construction
of
section
30
u.s.c.
--
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
that
is
if
you
adopt
our
theory
that
you
can
look
just
to
section
30
u.s.c.
16--
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
there
is
no
court
precedent
and
i
have
already
advised
the
court
and
i
think
there
are
interior
decisions
adverse
to
that
position.
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
i
think
the
--
our
basic
contention
in
this
case,
unless
if
that
argument
is
not
accepted,
the
basic
contention
is
that
the
prudent-man
test
applies
to
this
at
the
test
of
discovery
on
these
claims.
that
is
my
--
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
he
did
not
agree
with
it.
it
seem
to
me
that
in
he
--
unless
i
misunderstood
him,
he
said
“as
to
these
minerals
of
common
currents,
the
department
has
applied
this
other
test
of
what
we
call
or
say
is
present
marketability.
and
we
say
that
it's
our
position
that
the
prudent-man
test
is
the
applicable
test.
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
in
its
decision,
market
factors
are
relevant
evidence
in
considering
not
only
the
prudent
man
or
whether
a
prudent
man
would
be
justified
in
going
in.
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
that
is
the
--
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
the
solicitor,
as
i
understood
him,
had
as
an
additional
test
for
--
on
this
building
stone
cases
a
test
of
present
marketability.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
decisions
of
the
interior
department
where
they
have
called
it
as
an
additional
test
to
the
prudent-man
test
on
these
minerals
of
common
occurrence.
in
this
--
in
the
government's
briefs
in
this
case,
they
went
further
than
that.
they
said
the
present
market
or
ability
test
or
is
the
same,
essentially
the
same
as
the
prudent-man
test
and
we
are
maintaining
and
i
think
our
brief
will
point
up
our
argument
that
this
rule
of
marketability
is
something
that
has
been
developing
through
the
years
and
is
gradually
becoming
a
test
that
is
increasingly
astringent.
and
as
long
as
were
on
that
subject,
i
wish
to
--
i
think
i
can
illustrate
that.
i
pointed
out
that
on
my
understanding
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
is,
that
they
said
marketability
was
a
relevant
evidence
on
question
of
good
faith
if
mr.
coleman,
and
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
he
did
not
locate
these
claims
and
hold
these
claims
in
good
faith
for
this
building
stone.
but
he
says,
they
said:
“those
market
factors
are
relevant
evidence
on
a
question
of
good
faith
and
they
are
also
relevant
evidence
on
the
question
of
the
prudent-man
test.
what
the
circuit
court
says,
“you
can't
take
just
one
aspect
of
the
evidence
-
that
is
the
marketability
factors
-
and
apply
that
to
this
type
of
minerals
to
the
exclusion
of
the
other
evidence
relevant
in
the
prudent-man
test
and
as
i
read
the
opinion,
that
is
why
they
reversed
the
secretary's
decision.
mr.
barry
has
pointed
out
in
this
case
that
this
marketability
factor
is
something
that
he
says
he
argues
a
little
bit
that
they
don't
require
present
marketability.
i
say
that
when
they
provide,
as
the
decision
did
in
the
secretary's
decision
did
in
this
case,
that
unless
coleman
could
show
prior
to
july
the
23rd
1955
that
he
had
a
market
where
he
could
obtain
the
profit
for
his,
the
building
stone,
he
has
applying
the
present
marketability
as
a
test.
because
had
this
claims
been
located
on
july
the
2nd,
for
example
of
1955,
the
test
that
the
secretary's
opinion
applied
is
that
on
the
next
day,
he
would
have
to
show
that
there
was
a
market
for
this
building
stone
and
with
that,
we
disagree.
in
the
brief,
they
have
argued,
the
government
has
argued
that
present
marketability
is
not
--
is
the
proper
test
to
apply
as
i
read
the
brief.
i
wish
to
point
out
two
or
three
decisions
of
the
interior
department
in
the
past
where
they
certainly
did
not
apply
that
kind
of
a
test.
the
case
freeman
versus
summers,
--
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
as
i
read
their
opinion,
they
say
that
they
do
not
use
the
word
“present
marketability”
but
that
in
substance
is
what
they're
saying.
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
the
government's
brief.
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
for
example,
the
--
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
used
the
present
marketability
as
the
test?
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
well,
yes.
i
think
when
the
interior
department
or
the
secretary's
decision
said
that
unless
they
could
show
there
was
a
market
prior
to
july
23,
1955
while
the
claims
were
invalid,
they
were
applying
a
rule
of
present
marketability
at
a
profit
and
that
was
what
it
seems
to
me
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
on
among
other
things.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
that's
just
one
aspect
of
the
relevant
evidence
to
establish
whether
there
was
a
valuable
mineral
deposit
under
the
prudent-man
test.
but
when
they
say,
as
the
secretary's
opinion
did
in
this
case
that
on
that
particular
day,
you
had
to
show
marketability
of
the
profit
you
are
applying
to
test
the
present
marketability.
i
think
that
seems
quite
clear
at
least
to
me.
in
the
case
freeman
versus
summers
and
this
is
the
case
which
i
did
not
cite
in
my
brief.
52
id
201
in
1927
oily
shale
case,
the
interior
department
had
this
to
say
regarding
prospective
value
and
after
all
that
is,
speaking
a
--
that
is
the
other
side
of
the
coin
as
far
as
present
marketability
in
the
profit.
and
speaking
--
in
that
oily
shale
case,
they
said:
“while
at
the
present
time
there
has
been
no
considerable
production
of
oil
from
shale's,
due
to
the
fact
that
abundant
quantities
of
oil
had
been
produced
more
cheaply
from
oils,
there's
no
possible
doubt
of
it
value
and
of
the
fact
that
it
constitutes
an
enormously
valuable
resource
for
future
use
by
the
american
people.
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
52
id
201;
in
other
words
and
as
we
all
know,
the
oily
shale
case
is
not
yet
in
really
commercial
production
but
in
'27,
they
said
that
--
these
people
were
justified.
they
allowed
those
cases
to
go
to
a
mineral
patent
because
--
continuing
the
court
in
that
case,
“it
is
not
necessary
in
order
to
constitute
a
valid
discovery
under
the
mining
laws
sufficient
to
support
an
application
for
patent;
that
the
mineral
in
its
present
situation
can
be
immediately
disposed
of
at
a
profit.
now

mr.
howard

is

will
touch
on
that.

that's

mr.

mr.

twitty
that
would
be
true,
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
yes,
i'm
going
to
touch,
your
honor.
i
went
ahead
in
my
arguments
in
response
to
some
of
the
questions.
in
1939,
in
the
sand
and
gravel
case,
this
was
in
united
states
versus
underwood,
the
interior
department
spoke
that
--
in
that
particular
case,
the
sand
and
gravel
was
neither
presently
or
prospectively
valuable
at
that
time
which
indicated
that
at
that
time,
they
felt
that
the
doctrine
of
--
that
sand
and
gravel
might
have
a
perspective
value
and
rather
than
present
marketability
was
an
applicable
test.
that
case,
which
is
unreported,
is
a
22066
dated
august
the
17th
1939.
and
finally,
in
1954,
in
an
interior
department
decision,
united
states
versus
mouat
61
id
289,
you
can't
read
the
decision
but
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
interior,
rather
of
that
opinion
felt
perspective
value
which
was
a
proper
test
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
valuable
mineral
deposit
within
the
meaning
of
the
mining
laws.
i
mention
those
cases
merely
to
illustrate
that
--
since
those
cases
were
decided,
the
common
variety
is
--
law
was
enacted
in
july
the
23rd
1955.
and
since
that
time,
they
have
--
you
can't
find
cases
where
they
speak
of
perspective
value.
they
have
changed
their
standard.
now,
i
maintain
to
a
standard
of
present
marketability
at
a
profit
and
that
is
the
standard
to
which
we
object
as
a
sole
test
for
determining
whether
there
was
a
valuable
mineral
deposit
of
these
building
stone
claims.
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
the
beginning
of
that
paragraph,
it
states
“the
only
issue
in
dispute
at
the
hearing
on
september
16,
1958
was
the
existence
of
a
market
for
profitable
sales
before
july
23,
1955”.
and
that
the
sentence,
which
you
read,
mr.
justice
fortas,
as
i
understand,
as
i
read
it,
they
say
he
was
required
to
show
that
by
reasonable
--
all
pertinent
factors,
including
the
existence
of
a
present
demand
before
july
23,
1955,
the
deposit
upon
which
his
claim
was
based,
they
are
saying
that
that
is
one
of
the
essential
factors
that
they
must
show.
that
is
--
that's
why
--
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
where
was
that,
your
honor?
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
in
this
case,
in
the
government's
brief
which
you
refer
to,
they
have
pointed
on
page
12
too
--
first
of
all,
at
page
17
they
say
that
“the
prudent-man
test
and
the
profitable
marketability
test
are
not
essentially
distinct
standards.
rather,
the
latter
is
simply
a
refine
of
the
other”.
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
as
i
read
the
government's
brief,
they
do
not
concede
that
perspective
marketability
is
an
applica
--
is
proper
in
testing
whether
there
is
a
valuable
mineral
deposit.
because
on
page
12
of
their
brief,
they
say,
“furthermore,
it
has
never
been
thought
sufficient
for
a
mineral
claimant
to
prove
a
purely
speculative
value
predicated
on
some
indeterminate
future
rise
in
prices
or
decline
in
cost.
validation
of
claims
based
on
conjectural
market
fluctuation
would
merely
assist
private
investors
seeking
to
stockpile
the
public
domain.
now
on
our
oil
shale
case,
there
is
a
situation
where
the
oil
shale
was
--
there
was
no
commercial
market
for
it
but
they
held
that
that
was
a
proper
case
for
them
to
--
for
patent
to
issue
because
prudent
man,
considering
their
perspective
value
and
the
possibilities
in
the
future,
would
invest
money
with
the
hope
of
developing
a
pane
mining
operation.
now,
that
is
where
i
strongly
disagree
with.
in
outside
of
the

of
building

in
the
area
of

i'm
from

and
copper

is
one
of
the
most

today
just
simply
could
not
have
been
mined
20
years
ago
because
they
were
higher
grade
ores
being
mined
at
that
time
but
prudent-man
20
years
ago
would
recognize
that
the
situation
with
--
that
technology
would
have
been
improved
so
they'd
be
in
a
position
today
to
operate
this
mines
and
i
say
that
that
is
a
proper
consideration
in
determining
the
prudent-man
test
and
that
is
perhaps
one
of
our
basic
quarrels
with
the
interior
department
and
i'd
say
that
it's
a
proper
test
for
all
kinds
of
minerals,
whether
they
be
metallic
minerals
or
building
stone.
mr.
justice
white
mentioned
the
other
problem.
bear
in
mind
that
the
interior
department
in
its
decision
reached
the
--
made
the
conclusion
in
its
decision
that
this
building
stone
was
a
common
variety
and,
therefore,
this
july
23
cut-off
date
would
be
the
proper
date
for
applying
their
marketability
test.
we
have
--
we
strenuously
object
to
that.
first
of
all,
the
building
stone
act
was
enacted
for
stone
which
--
an
interior
decision
back
in
1891,
it
held
that
ordinary
building
stone
just
simply
could
not
be
located
under
the
mining
laws
and
that
was
the
reason
for
the
enactment
of
section
30-161
or
the
1892
act.
there
was
never,
in
any
of
the
debates,
in
the
congress
or
in
any
of
the
committee
report,
there's
nothing
in
the
common
varieties
act
that
said
--
suggest
that
there
was
an
intention
to
repeal
that
law
and
we
maintain
that
the
building
stone
act
is
still
the
law.
the
deputy
solicitor
in
the
secretary's
decision
in
this
case
said:
“in
view
of
the
immense
quantities
of
identical
stone
found
in
the
area
outside
the
claims,
the
stone
must
be
considered
a
common
variety”.
we
maintain,
this
is
a
building
stone
and
the
record
is
--
there
is
plenty
in
the
record,
the
government's
own
witnesses
testified
that
it
was
a
kind
of
stone
that
could
be
--
which
was
valuable
for
building
purposes
and
was
popular,
i
might
say,
and
used
to
great
deal
in
the
area,
in
the
vicinity
of
this
building
stone
claims.
the
deputy
solicitor,
where
he
says
that
it's
a
common
variety
because
of
the
immense
quantities
of
the
stone,
he
is
not
following
their
present
regulations.
because
their
present
regulations
43
c.f.r.
section
35
11.1,
which
i
do
not
have
in
my
brief,
says,
“mineral
materials,
which
occur
commonly
shall
not
be
deemed
to
be
common
varieties
if
a
particular
deposit
has
a
distinct
and
special
properties,
making
it
commercially
valuable
for
use
in
a
manufacturing,
industrial
or
processing
operation.
now
in
this
case,
admittedly,
these
building
stone
is
used
for
in
making
--
in
the
operation
of
--
i
mean
in
the
construction
work.
it
has
special
utility.
it
has
distinct
and
special
properties.
moreover,
and
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
i
think
--
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
i
think
this
court
has
adopted
as
the
proper
test
the
prudent-man
test
and
it's
the
test
applicable
to
all
valuable
mineral
deposits
and
that
is
the
test
which
--
the
test
congress
has
understood
the
law
as
to
be
and
it's
my
position
that
they
cannot
legislate
that
that
is
the
court's
interpretation
of
what
the
prudent-man
test
is
and
it
would
be
legislation
on
the
part
of
the
interior
department
to
engraft
a
new
rule
of
marketability.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court?
the
issues
in
this
case
involve
18
cluster
mining
claims
which
were
located
during
the
years
1949
through
1950.
they
were
located
pursuant
to
the
building
stone
law,
which
is
30
u.s.c.
161.
and
that
law
enacted
in
1892
provides
that
“lands
that
are
chiefly
valuable
for
building
stone,
may
be
located
under
the
law
(relating
to
cluster
mining
claims).”
in
1958,
the
contest
was
filed
in
this
case.
the
contest
complaint
has
three
charges,
three
grounds
for
seeking
to
hold
these
claims
invalid.
the
first
ground
was
that
there
was
--
the
lands
embraced
within
the
claims
are
non-mineral
in
character.
now,
in
the
evidence
in
this
case
and
both
the
hearing
examiners,
and
i
believe
even
in
the
brief
of
the
government,
it's
stated,
it's
agreed
that
this
land
is
chiefly
valuable
for
building
stone.
the
evidence
in
your
case
shows
that
that's
the
only
use
that
the
land
could
be
put.
there's
no
other
--
there
was
no
testimony
that
it
could
be
used
for
any
other
purpose.
so
on
that
charge
was
met
and
there's
no
controverting
evidence
whatsoever
on
that.
the
second
charge
in
the
contest
was
that
minerals
have
not
been
found
within
the
limits
of
the
claims
in
sufficient
quantities
to
constitute
a
valid
discovery.
as
mr.
barry
has
pointed
out,
the
evidence
is
clear
that
on
the
--
in
these
claims,
these
cluster
mining
claims
and
in
the
surrounding
area,
there
is
building
stone
to
a
depth
of
a
thousand
feet.
so
that
charge
is
simply
met.
there's
just
no
evidence
that
minerals
have
not
been
found
in
sufficient
quantities
to
constitute
a
valid
discovery.
the
third
charge
related
to
the
amount
of
work
required
on
each
claim
is
$500
worth
of
work
and
they
said
that
on
ten
of
the
claims,
there
had
not
been
$500
worth
of
work.
the
hearing
examiner
found
that,
as
to
five
of
the
claims,
mr.
coleman
had
established
the
market
and
held
five
valid.
both
sides
appealed
and
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
land
management
said
three
claims
and
part
of
the
fourth
were
valid
and
then
it
goes
to
the
secretary
and
the
secretary
decides,
as
i
read
his
decision,
and
this
was
the
decision
written
by
the
deputy
solicitor
for
the
department
as
he's
authorized
under
their
regulations.
the
decision
was
that,
“because
this
stone
is
a
common
variety,
and
because
coleman
had
not
demonstrated
the
market
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
common
varieties
act,
july
the
23rd
1955,
all
of
the
mining
claims
were
invalid”.
now,
the
--
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
your
honor,
we
have
pointed
out
that
under
the
building
stone
law,
it
says
that
“you
can
locate
and
you
can
go
on
the
lands,
enter
the
lands
for
lands
chiefly
valuable
for
building
stone.
we
say
that
on
that
alone,
we
should
be
entitled
to
a
patent.
if
--
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
chief;
it
says
“chiefly”
valuable.
now,
let
me
answer
that
question
a
little
more
fully,
if
i
may.
we
have
pointed
out
that
if
that
is
not
the
rule
-
there
are
no
laws
or
cases
–
and
i
might
state
that
there
interior
decisions
that
are
adverse
to
that
position,
but
our
position
is
that
if
the
law
of
discovery
is
the
applicable
law
under
section
30
u.s.c.
section
22,
i
mean
title
xxx
u.s.c.
section
22,
it
speaks
of
a
valuable
mineral
deposit.
and
in
castle
versus
womble,
which
is
the
case
this
court
has
--
where
an
early
land
department's
decision
which
this
court
has
followed
as
recently
as
in
best
versus
humboldt
placer
mining
company,
this
court
said
that
what
that
means,
“is
there
a
valuable
deposit?”
is,
it's
the
prudent-man
test
whether
that
would
justify
a
man
going
on
the
claims
with
a
reasonable
expectation
of
working
the
claims
and
eventually,
into
some
sort
of
a
mining
venture.
it
is
our
position
--
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
if
the
court
rules
that
--
our
argument
that
just
showing
building
stone
chiefly
valuable,
i
mean
the
lands
chiefly
valuable
for
building
stone
is
enough
to
obtain
patent.
if
the
court
disagrees
with
that
position,
then
i
say
that
that
is
the
prudent-man
test
in
the
construction
of
section
30
u.s.c.
22
as
the
applicable
test.
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
we
have
urged
that
that
is
a
proper
construction
of
section
30
u.s.c.
--
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
that
is
if
you
adopt
our
theory
that
you
can
look
just
to
section
30
u.s.c.
16--
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
there
is
no
court
precedent
and
i
have
already
advised
the
court
and
i
think
there
are
interior
decisions
adverse
to
that
position.
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
i
think
the
--
our
basic
contention
in
this
case,
unless
if
that
argument
is
not
accepted,
the
basic
contention
is
that
the
prudent-man
test
applies
to
this
at
the
test
of
discovery
on
these
claims.
that
is
my
--
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
he
did
not
agree
with
it.
it
seem
to
me
that
in
he
--
unless
i
misunderstood
him,
he
said
“as
to
these
minerals
of
common
currents,
the
department
has
applied
this
other
test
of
what
we
call
or
say
is
present
marketability.
and
we
say
that
it's
our
position
that
the
prudent-man
test
is
the
applicable
test.
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
in
its
decision,
market
factors
are
relevant
evidence
in
considering
not
only
the
prudent
man
or
whether
a
prudent
man
would
be
justified
in
going
in.
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
that
is
the
--
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
the
solicitor,
as
i
understood
him,
had
as
an
additional
test
for
--
on
this
building
stone
cases
a
test
of
present
marketability.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
decisions
of
the
interior
department
where
they
have
called
it
as
an
additional
test
to
the
prudent-man
test
on
these
minerals
of
common
occurrence.
in
this
--
in
the
government's
briefs
in
this
case,
they
went
further
than
that.
they
said
the
present
market
or
ability
test
or
is
the
same,
essentially
the
same
as
the
prudent-man
test
and
we
are
maintaining
and
i
think
our
brief
will
point
up
our
argument
that
this
rule
of
marketability
is
something
that
has
been
developing
through
the
years
and
is
gradually
becoming
a
test
that
is
increasingly
astringent.
and
as
long
as
were
on
that
subject,
i
wish
to
--
i
think
i
can
illustrate
that.
i
pointed
out
that
on
my
understanding
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
is,
that
they
said
marketability
was
a
relevant
evidence
on
question
of
good
faith
if
mr.
coleman,
and
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
he
did
not
locate
these
claims
and
hold
these
claims
in
good
faith
for
this
building
stone.
but
he
says,
they
said:
“those
market
factors
are
relevant
evidence
on
a
question
of
good
faith
and
they
are
also
relevant
evidence
on
the
question
of
the
prudent-man
test.
what
the
circuit
court
says,
“you
can't
take
just
one
aspect
of
the
evidence
-
that
is
the
marketability
factors
-
and
apply
that
to
this
type
of
minerals
to
the
exclusion
of
the
other
evidence
relevant
in
the
prudent-man
test
and
as
i
read
the
opinion,
that
is
why
they
reversed
the
secretary's
decision.
mr.
barry
has
pointed
out
in
this
case
that
this
marketability
factor
is
something
that
he
says
he
argues
a
little
bit
that
they
don't
require
present
marketability.
i
say
that
when
they
provide,
as
the
decision
did
in
the
secretary's
decision
did
in
this
case,
that
unless
coleman
could
show
prior
to
july
the
23rd
1955
that
he
had
a
market
where
he
could
obtain
the
profit
for
his,
the
building
stone,
he
has
applying
the
present
marketability
as
a
test.
because
had
this
claims
been
located
on
july
the
2nd,
for
example
of
1955,
the
test
that
the
secretary's
opinion
applied
is
that
on
the
next
day,
he
would
have
to
show
that
there
was
a
market
for
this
building
stone
and
with
that,
we
disagree.
in
the
brief,
they
have
argued,
the
government
has
argued
that
present
marketability
is
not
--
is
the
proper
test
to
apply
as
i
read
the
brief.
i
wish
to
point
out
two
or
three
decisions
of
the
interior
department
in
the
past
where
they
certainly
did
not
apply
that
kind
of
a
test.
the
case
freeman
versus
summers,
--
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
as
i
read
their
opinion,
they
say
that
they
do
not
use
the
word
“present
marketability”
but
that
in
substance
is
what
they're
saying.
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
the
government's
brief.
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
for
example,
the
--
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
used
the
present
marketability
as
the
test?
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
well,
yes.
i
think
when
the
interior
department
or
the
secretary's
decision
said
that
unless
they
could
show
there
was
a
market
prior
to
july
23,
1955
while
the
claims
were
invalid,
they
were
applying
a
rule
of
present
marketability
at
a
profit
and
that
was
what
it
seems
to
me
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
on
among
other
things.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
that's
just
one
aspect
of
the
relevant
evidence
to
establish
whether
there
was
a
valuable
mineral
deposit
under
the
prudent-man
test.
but
when
they
say,
as
the
secretary's
opinion
did
in
this
case
that
on
that
particular
day,
you
had
to
show
marketability
of
the
profit
you
are
applying
to
test
the
present
marketability.
i
think
that
seems
quite
clear
at
least
to
me.
in
the
case
freeman
versus
summers
and
this
is
the
case
which
i
did
not
cite
in
my
brief.
52
id
201
in
1927
oily
shale
case,
the
interior
department
had
this
to
say
regarding
prospective
value
and
after
all
that
is,
speaking
a
--
that
is
the
other
side
of
the
coin
as
far
as
present
marketability
in
the
profit.
and
speaking
--
in
that
oily
shale
case,
they
said:
“while
at
the
present
time
there
has
been
no
considerable
production
of
oil
from
shale's,
due
to
the
fact
that
abundant
quantities
of
oil
had
been
produced
more
cheaply
from
oils,
there's
no
possible
doubt
of
it
value
and
of
the
fact
that
it
constitutes
an
enormously
valuable
resource
for
future
use
by
the
american
people.
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
52
id
201;
in
other
words
and
as
we
all
know,
the
oily
shale
case
is
not
yet
in
really
commercial
production
but
in
'27,
they
said
that
--
these
people
were
justified.
they
allowed
those
cases
to
go
to
a
mineral
patent
because
--
continuing
the
court
in
that
case,
“it
is
not
necessary
in
order
to
constitute
a
valid
discovery
under
the
mining
laws
sufficient
to
support
an
application
for
patent;
that
the
mineral
in
its
present
situation
can
be
immediately
disposed
of
at
a
profit.
now
--
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
which
is
used?
mr.
howard

i
will
touch
on
that.

that's

mr.

mr.

that's

mr.

that
would
be
true,
yes.
mr.

twitty
yes,
i'm
going
to
touch,
your
honor.
i
went
ahead
in
my
arguments
in
response
to
some
of
the
questions.
in
1939,
in
the
sand
and
gravel
case,
this
was
in
united
states
versus
underwood,
the
interior
department
spoke
that
--
in
that
particular
case,
the
sand
and
gravel
was
neither
presently
or
prospectively
valuable
at
that
time
which
indicated
that
at
that
time,
they
felt
that
the
doctrine
of
--
that
sand
and
gravel
might
have
a
perspective
value
and
rather
than
present
marketability
was
an
applicable
test.
that
case,
which
is
unreported,
is
a
22066
dated
august
the
17th
1939.
and
finally,
in
1954,
in
an
interior
department
decision,
united
states
versus
mouat
61
id
289,
you
can't
read
the
decision
but
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
interior,
rather
of
that
opinion
felt
perspective
value
which
was
a
proper
test
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
valuable
mineral
deposit
within
the
meaning
of
the
mining
laws.
i
mention
those
cases
merely
to
illustrate
that
--
since
those
cases
were
decided,
the
common
variety
is
--
law
was
enacted
in
july
the
23rd
1955.
and
since
that
time,
they
have
--
you
can't
find
cases
where
they
speak
of
perspective
value.
they
have
changed
their
standard.
now,
i
maintain
to
a
standard
of
present
marketability
at
a
profit
and
that
is
the
standard
to
which
we
object
as
a
sole
test
for
determining
whether
there
was
a
valuable
mineral
deposit
of
these
building
stone
claims.
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
the
beginning
of
that
paragraph,
it
states
“the
only
issue
in
dispute
at
the
hearing
on
september
16,
1958
was
the
existence
of
a
market
for
profitable
sales
before
july
23,
1955”.
and
that
the
sentence,
which
you
read,
mr.
justice
fortas,
as
i
understand,
as
i
read
it,
they
say
he
was
required
to
show
that
by
reasonable
--
all
pertinent
factors,
including
the
existence
of
a
present
demand
before
july
23,
1955,
the
deposit
upon
which
his
claim
was
based,
they
are
saying
that
that
is
one
of
the
essential
factors
that
they
must
show.
that
is
--
that's
why
--
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
where
was
that,
your
honor?
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
in
this
case,
in
the
government's
brief
which
you
refer
to,
they
have
pointed
on
page
12
too
--
first
of
all,
at
page
17
they
say
that
“the
prudent-man
test
and
the
profitable
marketability
test
are
not
essentially
distinct
standards.
rather,
the
latter
is
simply
a
refine
of
the
other”.
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
as
i
read
the
government's
brief,
they
do
not
concede
that
perspective
marketability
is
an
applica
--
is
proper
in
testing
whether
there
is
a
valuable
mineral
deposit.
because
on
page
12
of
their
brief,
they
say,
“furthermore,
it
has
never
been
thought
sufficient
for
a
mineral
claimant
to
prove
a
purely
speculative
value
predicated
on
some
indeterminate
future
rise
in
prices
or
decline
in
cost.
validation
of
claims
based
on
conjectural
market
fluctuation
would
merely
assist
private
investors
seeking
to
stockpile
the
public
domain.
now
on
our
oil
shale
case,
there
is
a
situation
where
the
oil
shale
was
--
there
was
no
commercial
market
for
it
but
they
held
that
that
was
a
proper
case
for
them
to
--
for
patent
to
issue
because
prudent
man,
considering
their
perspective
value
and
the
possibilities
in
the
future,
would
invest
money
with
the
hope
of
developing
a
pane
mining
operation.
now,
that
is
where
i
strongly
disagree
with.
in
outside
of
the
area
of
building
stone
in
the
area
of
mines,
i'm
from
arizona
and
copper
mine
is
one
of
the
most
important,
there
had
been
--
the
mining
today
in
arizona,
the
ores
now
being
mine
today
just
simply
could
not
have
been
mined
20
years
ago
because
they
were
higher
grade
ores
being
mined
at
that
time
but
prudent-man
20
years
ago
would
recognize
that
the
situation
with
--
that
technology
would
have
been
improved
so
they'd
be
in
a
position
today
to
operate
this
mines
and
i
say
that
that
is
a
proper
consideration
in
determining
the
prudent-man
test
and
that
is
perhaps
one
of
our
basic
quarrels
with
the
interior
department
and
i'd
say
that
it's
a
proper
test
for
all
kinds
of
minerals,
whether
they
be
metallic
minerals
or
building
stone.
mr.
justice
white
mentioned
the
other
problem.
bear
in
mind
that
the
interior
department
in
its
decision
reached
the
--
made
the
conclusion
in
its
decision
that
this
building
stone
was
a
common
variety
and,
therefore,
this
july
23
cut-off
date
would
be
the
proper
date
for
applying
their
marketability
test.
we
have
--
we
strenuously
object
to
that.
first
of
all,
the
building
stone
act
was
enacted
for
stone
which
--
an
interior
decision
back
in
1891,
it
held
that
ordinary
building
stone
just
simply
could
not
be
located
under
the
mining
laws
and
that
was
the
reason
for
the
enactment
of
section
30-161
or
the
1892
act.
there
was
never,
in
any
of
the
debates,
in
the
congress
or
in
any
of
the
committee
report,
there's
nothing
in
the
common
varieties
act
that
said
--
suggest
that
there
was
an
intention
to
repeal
that
law
and
we
maintain
that
the
building
stone
act
is
still
the
law.
the
deputy
solicitor
in
the
secretary's
decision
in
this
case
said:
“in
view
of
the
immense
quantities
of
identical
stone
found
in
the
area
outside
the
claims,
the
stone
must
be
considered
a
common
variety”.
we
maintain,
this
is
a
building
stone
and
the
record
is
--
there
is
plenty
in
the
record,
the
government's
own
witnesses
testified
that
it
was
a
kind
of
stone
that
could
be
--
which
was
valuable
for
building
purposes
and
was
popular,
i
might
say,
and
used
to
great
deal
in
the
area,
in
the
vicinity
of
this
building
stone
claims.
the
deputy
solicitor,
where
he
says
that
it's
a
common
variety
because
of
the
immense
quantities
of
the
stone,
he
is
not
following
their
present
regulations.
because
their
present
regulations
43
c.f.r.
section
35
11.1,
which
i
do
not
have
in
my
brief,
says,
“mineral
materials,
which
occur
commonly
shall
not
be
deemed
to
be
common
varieties
if
a
particular
deposit
has
a
distinct
and
special
properties,
making
it
commercially
valuable
for
use
in
a
manufacturing,
industrial
or
processing
operation.
now
in
this
case,
admittedly,
these
building
stone
is
used
for
in
making
--
in
the
operation
of
--
i
mean
in
the
construction
work.
it
has
special
utility.
it
has
distinct
and
special
properties.
moreover,
and
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
i
think
--
mr.
howard
a.
twitty
i
think
this
court
has
adopted
as
the
proper
test
the
prudent-man
test
and
it's
the
test
applicable
to
all
valuable
mineral
deposits
and
that
is
the
test
which
--
the
test
congress
has
understood
the
law
as
to
be
and
it's
my
position
that
they
cannot
legislate
that
that
is
the
court's
interpretation
of
what
the
prudent-man
test
is
and
it
would
be
legislation
on
the
part
of
the
interior
department
to
engraft
a
new
rule
of
marketability.
thank
you.
