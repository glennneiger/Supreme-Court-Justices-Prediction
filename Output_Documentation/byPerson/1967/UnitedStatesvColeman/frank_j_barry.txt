mr.
frank
j.
barry
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
validity
of
the
decision
of
the
secretary
of
interior
which
invalidated
and
declared
null
and
void
18
mining
claims
in
the
san
bernardino
national
forest
about
40
miles
from
san
bernardino
on
the
crust
to
the
mountains
near
big
bear
lake.
the
claims
were
located
for
building
stone
and
they
were
located
in
1959,
in
1949,
1951
and
1952
by
mr.
and
mrs.
coleman.
the
claims
are
40
acres
each
and
they
extend
from
the
main
road,
which
is
the
main
road
to
big
bear
highway
no.
18
and
they
rise
up
on
a
mountain
with
a
southern
and
eastern
exposure
-
that
is
their
exposure
on
those
sides
of
the
mountain
-
overlooking
baldwin
lake,
in
the
distance
the
mojave
desert
and
overlooking
big
bear
lake.
claims
were
located
for
building
stone
and
the
principal
issue
in
the
case
has
to
do
with
whether
the
secretary
of
the
interior
applied
the
proper
rule
when
he
declared
that
the
time-honored,
prudent-manner
rule
included
a
rule
that
there
must
be
a
showing
that
the
mining
claims
or
that
the
product
of
the
mining
claims,
the
building
stone
could
have
been
marketed
prior
to
july
23,
1955,
the
date
of
the
multiple
use
act.
the
importance
of
that
date
is
as
follows.
the
multiple
use
act
declared
that
common
varieties
of
sand,
stone,
gravel
and
certain
other
minerals
could
no
longer
be
deemed
to
be
valuable
mineral
deposits
under
the
mining
law
so
that
the
discovery
of
such
commodities
on
the
public
land
would
give
one
the
right
to
locate
and
to
have
a
valid
mining
claim.
the
evidence
in
the
case
was
that
the
stone
was
quartzite.
quartzite
is
a
very
hard
mineral.
it
is
a
metamorphic
mineral,
a
mineral
that
has
been
created
by
forces
of
nature
acting
upon
sandstone.
quartzite
occurs
on
the
claims
in
large,
massive
chunks.
and
by
that,
i
mean
cliffs
in
the
mountain
itself
that
it
breaks
unpredictably;
that
is
to
say
it
doesn't
break
in
slabs.
it
breaks
in
any
direction
without
any
prediction
as
to
what
it
would
be,
but
it
is
quite
colorful.
there
are
some
pictures
that
indicate
that
it's
a
very
colorful
stone.
it
is
not
–
it's
got
very
dominant
colors
in
it
-
reds
and
yellows
and
browns;
they
are
very
strong
colors.
that
the
stone
has
been
used
and
it
locally
and
to
some
extent,
away
from
the
area
for
building;
that,
however,
it
is
an
unpopular
stone
in
the
industry.
one
of
the
witnesses
was
the
principal
executive
officer
or
western
representative
or
southern
representative
of
a
stone
marketing
company
who
testified
that
the
stone
was
unpopular;
that
the
stone
masons
didn't
like
to
use
it;
that
it
was
too
hard;
that
it
was
too
heavy;
that
it
dulled
the
tools
that
the
stone
masons
used;
that
there
haven't
been
any
call
for
it
for
sometime.
there
was
some
reference
to
a
call
about
six
months
ago
that
caused
into
make
an
inquiry
among
the
other
suppliers
to
know
if
any
was
available;
that
he
hadn't
stocked
it
for
years
and
that
there
wasn't
any
to
his
knowledge
being
stocked
elsewhere.
the
problem
of
marketability
is
related
to
the
rule,
the
prudent-man
rule,
which
is
the
rule
that's
been
applied
by
the
department
and
upheld
by
this
court,
is
related
to
the
rule.
indeed,
it
is
merely
an
application
of
the
rule
to
certain
types
of
minerals.
the
marketability
or
excuse
me,
the
prudent-man
rule
is
this:
that
one
does
not
have
a
valuable
discovery
which
is
essential
to
the
validity
of
a
mining
claim,
unless
he
has
within
the
limits
of
his
claim
an
exposure
of
mineral
and
evidence
that
a
man
of
ordinary
--
that
would
induce
a
man
of
ordinary
prudence
to
extend
his
energy
and
his
labor
and
his
means
with
a
reasonable
prospect
of
developing
a
valuable
mine.
this
is
the
one,
the
principal,
the
most
important
element
in
mining
laws
so
far
as
it
relates
to
the
public
domain.
by
failure
to
comply
with
this
particular
provision
of
mining
law
or
by
circumstances
that
do
not
qualify,
the
mining
claimant
is
denied
a
patent
which
gives
him
unrestricted
use
of
the
land.
he
obtains
the
title
in
fee
simple
without
any
reservation,
without
any
limitation
as
to
what
he
would
use
it
for.
he
becomes
the
owner
of
the
land.
indeed,
even
before
he
gets
a
patent,
he
has
practically
the
rights
of
a
patentee
with
the
exception
that
he
can't
market
timber
or
use
other
products
of
the
land
other
than
the
minerals,
the
--
except
in
connection
with
his
mining
operation,
the
prudent-man
rule
has
been
applied
over
the
years
and
from
the
earliest
time,
it
has
been
applied
with
special
reference
to
this
type
of
mineral,
which
occur
so
widely
that
to
say
merely
that
you
have
the
mineral
would
not
really
be
sufficient
to
say
that
you
can
actually
make
a
profit.
can
a
man,
when
he
stumbles
upon
a
deposit
of
sand,
justify
to
himself
the
expenditure
of
the
labor
and
the
means
necessary
to
develop
a
valuable
mine?
can
he
reasonably
do
this?
this
is
the
test
that
we
have
applied.
and
if
what
he
is
working
with
is
something
as
common
as
stone
or
sand
and
gravel,
the
department
has
required
for
years
that
there
be
a
showing
that
there
be
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
defendant
or
that
the
contestant
in
the
case
could
establish
that
he
was
able
to
extract
the
minerals
to
transport
them
to
market
and
to
dispose
of
them
in
the
marketplace
at
a
reasonable
profit
to
justify
his
effort
and
his
expenditure.
this
basically
is
the
prudent-man
rule.
this
is
the
rule
which,
as
extended
to,
minerals
of
this
character
is
known
as
the
rule
of
marketability.
mr.
frank
j.
barry
only
--
mr.
frank
j.
barry
the
ninth
circuit
has
indicated
in
its
opinion
that
what
was
required
by
us
was
an
actual
showing
that
there
had
been
minerals
marketed
at
a
profit
at
the
time
that
the
application
is
made.
all
the
we
required
is,
that
there
be
some
showing
that
you
could
market
it.
now,
that
would
included
indeed
some
showing,
for
example,
that
if
i
were
to
invest
my
money
today,
that
perhaps
next
saturday,
i
would
be
able
to
market
or
at
some
reasonable
time
in
the
future.
but
a
hypothetical
idea,
to
put
the
kind
of
money
it
would
take
into
the
development
of
a
mining
claim
to
develop
a
large
mine
for
sand
and
gravel
or
for
building
stone,
if
i'm
going
to
compete
with
everyone
across
the
road
and
on
the
same
side
of
the
road
as
i
am,
i
wouldn't
invest
that
money
unless
i
had
some
assurance
that
i
could
market
the
property.
i
assume
that
this
is
--
mr.
frank
j.
barry
..discussing
before
the
recess
the
fact
that
this
particular
stone
that
is
found
on
this
claim
has
not
been
--
is
not
marketable
in
the
area
of
southern
california
where
it's
located.
perhaps,
i
should
detail
a
bit
of
the
evidence
as
to
what
the
experience
of
this
particular
locator
has
been
on
the
claim.
over
the
period
of
ten
years
from
the
time
that
the
claims
were
originally
located
until
the
hearing,
he
had
sold
approximately
1,000
tons
of
the
stone
by
his
estimate
which
are
experts
estimated
was
approximately
correct
and
we
don't
question
and
that
he
got
an
average
of
$12
per
ton
for
that
thousand
tons.
so
that
his
total
revenue
from
the
property
with
respect
to
the
building
stone
alone
would
be
in
the
neighborhood
of
$12,000
over
a
period
of
10
years.
mr.
frank
j.
barry
that
appears
to
have
been
his
gross.
now,
he
expended
a
very
large
amount
of
money,
if
this
can
be
attributed
to
mining.
he
spent
a
great
deal
of
time,
which
was
estimated,
i
think
perhaps
the
court
could
be
justified
in
ignoring
the
enormous
size.
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
would
naturally
lend
itself
to
exaggeration.
he
valued
his
time
at
$3.50
an
hour
and
he
said
that
he
worked
300
days
a
year
and
that
so
many
hours
a
day
and
someone
multiplied
it
out
and
it
came
to
$157,000
but
this
is
what
he
had
been
spending
his
life
on
for
the
past
10
years
on
these
claims
and
this
is
the
amount
of
gross
sales
that
he
had
made.
in
addition,
he
had
expended
a
considerable
amount
of
money.
he
had
invested
money
in
equipment.
most
of
it
incidentally,
from
what
appears
on
the
record,
equipment
that
would
be
suitable
for
road
grading.
the
particular
work
that
was
done
on
the
claim
seems
not
to
have
been
strictly
speaking,
coring
work.
that
is
to
say
he
did
not
excavate
far
down
into
the
deposit
but
what
he
was
doing
was
selecting
from
the
rock
slides
in
a
broken
pieces
of
rock
that
are
found
rather
commonly
across
the
surface
of
the
claims.
he
was
picking
out
suitable
types
of
rocks,
sorting
them
out,
classifying
them
and
so
forth
and
he
would
sell
some
of
these
rocks.
and
as
i
say,
over
the
period
of
10
years,
he
sold
$12,000
worth
of
rock.
this
is
what
the
evidence
would
show.
mr.
frank
j.
barry
he
lived
on
the
land.
he
had
a
home
there
and
he
lived
there
with
his
wife.
there's
a
picture
of
the
home
in
the
record,
a
colored
picture
and
it
shows
it
to
be
a
quite
and
nice
little
piece
of
property
right
on
the
road.
there
are
number
of
roads
on
the
claims
that
--
i
don't
know
how
many
miles,
i
don't
know
that
the
record
shows.
i
know
that
it's
at
least
3
½
miles
of
roads
that
go
up
on
the
claim.
the
claim
covers
an
area
of
over
a
square
mile
or
720
acres
and
it's
approximately
--
well,
a
640
acres
to
a
claim
or
to
a
square
mile.
now,
the
department
of
interior
in
its
decision,
considered
how
much
he
had
marketed
of
this
stone
over
a
period
of
time,
all
of
which
was
in
the
record,
how
much
he
had
gotten
for
it,
how
much
labor
he
had
to
expend,
how
much
of
the
stone
there
was
in
the
neighborhood.
and
in
the
area
in
which
these
claims
are
located,
there
are
roughly
40,000
or
40
square
miles
to
28,000
acres
of
quartzite
exposed
about
a
thousand
feet
thick.
and
that's
enough
quartzite
to
stretch
from
here
to
there
or
some
all
sorts
of
statistics,
it
could
cover
the
district
of
columbia
or
third
of
the
district
of
columbia
to
a
depth
of
about
a
thousand
feet.
it
could
--
you
can
think
of
it
in
terms
of
an
enormous
amount
of
stone.
now,
most
of
the
operation
that
had
been
conducted
as
shown
by
the
evidence
was,
the
business
of
simply
sorting
the
stone
that
was
found
on
the
surface
-
that
is
to
say
he
picked
out
pieces
of
stone
that
would
be
suitable
for
a
particular
purpose.
in
other
words,
if
wanted
to
get
some
slabs,
he
would
look
around
until
he
found
pieces
that
broke
into
slabs
and
that
kind
of
thing.
and
these
stones
are
piled
up,
in
fact
i
think
there
are
some
pictures
in
the
record
that
show
that
they
were
piled
up
in
the
vicinity
of
his
home;
some
of
them
are
flat
and
so
forth
and
some
of
them
are
just
chunks.
but
most
of
the
stone,
the
evidence
showed,
is
the
type
that
is
massive
and
that
if
you
try
to
break
it,
it
breaks
in
an
unpredictable
way.
and
that
if
a
piece
doesn't
break
out,
suitable
for
the
purpose
that
you
need,
it
can
be
discarded
or
put
through
a
crasher
to
make
gravel
out
of
it
or
something
like
that,
but
it
wouldn't
have
any
particular
use
to
fill
a
particular
order.
now,
we
looked
at
this
case,
that
is
the
department
of
interior
who
looked
to
the
case,
made
a
determination
that
if
this
man
wanted
to
develop
a
mine
there
and
wanted
to
invest
the
kind
of
money
he
was
talking
about
to
start
at
the
top
and
work
down
that
whole
mountain
of
building
stone
that
he
could
not
have
had
a
market,
hot
for
that
quantity
but
not
for
any
kind
of
a
reasonable
operation.
he
could
not
have
had
a
market
for
his
product
of
his
claim.
and,
we
therefore
concluded
that
he
should
not
get
a
patent
to
the
public
domain
to
take
this
land
out
of
the
national
forest,
put
it
into
private
ownership
for
any
kind
of
use
because
it
was
very
likely,
notwithstanding
that
there's
no
limitation
on
what
a
man
does
with
property
after
he
gets
it,
that
a
prudent
miner
would
not
develop
this
property
for
a
mine.
and
that
is
what
we're
trying
to
administer
when
we
administered
the
mining
laws
in
the
department
of
interior.
the
original
law
was
passed
in
1872
at
the
time
when
the
country,
when
the
laws
of
the
country
were
intended
to
encourage
people
to
go
out
and
live
upon
the
land,
to
fill
up
the
country
with
people
so
there'd
be
some
people
living
out
there
in
these
areas
in
the
west.
so
there
was
lavishness
about
how
the
public
land
laws
were
administered.
now,
the
law
has
not
changed
but
times
have
changed.
and
i
don't
suggest
that
we
have
interpreted
the
laws
any
differently
than
they
have
been
interpreted
from
the
beginning
but
lots
of
things
have
changed.
nowadays,
there
are
all
kinds
of
demands
for
public
land
and
you
will
notice
in
the
briefs
that
had
been
filed
in
this
case
that
we
are
accused
of
having
engrafted
something
on
the
new
law,
something
that
isn't
authorized
by
congress
in
some
sense
that
we
may
have
violated
the
rights
of
the
contestee
in
this
case,
but
i
say
that
the
law
has
not
changed.
the
old
cases
support
the
proposition
that
one
is
not
entitled
to
obtain
land
from
the
united
states
from
the
public
domain,
unless
he
can
show
that
he
will
carry
out
a
policy
that
congress
was
trying
to
encourage,
for
example,
to
encourage
the
development
of
mineral
resources.
from
the
very
earliest
days,
we
had
the
rule
that
that
math
that
we
were
not
giving
a
mining
patent
to
someone
unless
on
an
objective
basis,
an
ordinary
prudent
man
would
be
one
who
would
spend
his
time
and
money
to
develop
the
property,
to
develop
a
mine.
that
was
the
rule
that
we
adopted
from
those
days.
now
i
say
that
times
have
changed,
because
now
there
are
lots
of
demands
for
lands
and
there's
a
great
deal
of
concern
for
land.
people
need
land
for
cities
and
for
highways
and
for
residences
and
for
all
kinds
of
purposes,
for
summer
homes
indeed
in
any
part
of
the
west.
and
because
times
have
changed,
there's
been
a
good
deal
more
strictness.
before
1910,
there
almost
was
never
a
mineral
examination
by
a
government
representative
when
if
someone
made
an
application
for
mining
claim.
that's
just
an
evidence
of
the
attitude
that
we
had
about
anyone
who
was
applying
for
a
mining
claim
in
those
days.
in
1910,
we
started
hiring
in
the
department
of
interior,
we
started
hiring
people
to
–
local
miners
to
kind
of
verify
if
the
allegations
that
were
made
in
patent
applications
and
tell
us
was
there
really
a
discovery,
are
these
people
really
entitled
to
get
a
patent.
about
1917,
the
department
started
hiring
full
time
mining
engineers
and
geologists
to
go
out
and
make
inspections
of
claims.
and
believe
it
or
not,
until
1940,
they
were
still
issuing
patents
without
any
mineral
inspection
of
the
claims
by
the
government
at
all,
but
i
think
the
times
have
changed.
that
mineral
examiners
have
become
more
particular.
they
have
insisted
that
they
see
on
the
ground
the
evidence
and
the
facts
that
justify
this
man's
claim
that
he
can
make
a
business
here
and
make
a
profit
at
his
business.
and,
lawyers
and
the
government
are
being
more
strict
in
the
application
of
rules
that
have
been
in
the
books
and
that
have
been
spelled
out
by
this
court
just
this
strictly
but
no
more
strictly
than
they're
being
applied
now.
in
the
cameron
case,
which
is
a
very
like
this
case,
a
case
in
which
the
department
had
declared
invalid
mining
claims
on
the
rim
of
the
grand
canyon.
mr.
cameron
refused
to
leave
the
property
as
did
mr.
coleman,
after
his
claims
had
been
made
--
declared
null
and
void
and
the
government
sued
in
the
nature
of
ejectment
and
in
that
case,
the
court
applied
a
strict
standard.
it
said,
you
have
to
have
a
discovery
and
the
evidence
has
to
be
such
that
a
reasonable
man
would
spend
his
time
and
money
with
a
prospect
of
developing
a
valuable
mine.
the
evidence
in
this
case
didn't
show
that.
the
circuit
court
has
said
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
the
department
of
interior,
had
rendered
a
decision
which
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
abuse
of
discretion.
and
for
what
i've
been
able
to
see
of
the
case
is
that
means
that
the
decision
that
has
been
rendered
in
the
department
was
irrational,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
a
reasonable
argument
that
we
would
ask
this
court
to
review
it.
i
would
like
--
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
would
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
--
mr.
frank
j.
barry
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
j.
barry
let
me
just
point
this.
i'm
sure
i
won't
need
to
state
to
you
how
the
department
of
interior
operates.
but
just
as
we
are
asking
this
court
to
reverse
the
ninth
circuit,
the
forest
service,
who
conducted
this
appeal
and
carried
on
the
prosecution
in
the
lower
court,
appealed
and
asked
the
secretary
to
reverse
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
land
management.
there
is
a
saying
in
the
department,
i
don't
know
if
its
common
in
government
at
all
but
you've
asked
me
if
it's
still
debated.
i
might
say
in
response
that
we
may
be
wrong,
but
we're
never
in
doubt.
but
we
are
--
and
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
question
about
it;
that
these
claims
cannot
be
marketed.
that
is
the
product
of
these
claims
cannot
be
mark
--
a
mine
cannot
be
developed
there.
it
would
cause
too
much
money
to
mine.
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
indicate
incidentally
that
one
could
mine
and
make
a
profit,
but
we're
saying
that
we
go
a
step
further.
the
evidence
that
we
have
is
that
you
could
not
mine
because
no
one
wants
to
buy
this
stone.
no
substantial
number
of
people
want
to
buy
this
stone,
certainly
not
enough
to
justify
the
united
states
in
disposing
of
such
a
large
tract
to
find
land.
mr.
frank
j.
barry
i'm
not
so
sure
that
there
would
be
--
i
think
that
the
ninth
circuit
misstated
what
the
department
of
interior
had
held.
and
if
i
can
refer
to
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit,
the
court
said
that,
“the
department
had
applied
a
rule
in
derogation
of
castle
against
womble
and
had
required
that,
castle
against
womble
is
the
old
case
of
1894
that
was
decided
in
the
department
of
interior,
that
we
had
applied
a
rule
that
was
in
derogation
of
castle
against
womble
and
had
required
a
showing
that
right
today,
that
presently,
the
man
was
making
a
profit.
we
did
not
make
any
such
--
we
did
not
apply
any
such
rule.
we
applied
the
rule
and
you
can
see
by
examining,
simply
they
had
note
in
the
case
that
we
--
that
was
decided
in
the
department.
they
had
noticed
this.
it
says,
“to
satisfy
the
requirement
for
a
discovery
on
a
building
stone
claim
located
before
july
23,
1955,
it
must
be
shown
that
the
exposed
materials
a
common
variety
of
stone
appearing
within
the
limits
of
the
claim,
could
have
been
extracted,
removed
and
marketed
at
a
profit
prior
to
that
date.
and
where
a
showing
is
not
made,
the
mining
claim
is
properly
declared
null
and
void.”
that
was
what
we
held.
and
what
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
we
held
was
that
we
had
required
that
there
be
a
showing
that
there
is
a
present
profit
being
made
by
the
contestee.
we
do
not
require
that.
our
marketability
test
does
not
require
that.
we
only
require
evidence
that
you
could
market
it
if
you
produced.
no
effort
was
made
to
do
anymore
than
that
in
the
trial
and
no
such
ruling
was
made
by
the
department.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i'd
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
frank
j.
barry
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
i
think
perhaps
i
have
to
clarify
the
present
marketability
rule
emphasize
again
what
i
said
before.
the
prudent-man
rule,
note:
“is
cast
in
terms
of
a
prudent-man”.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
kind
of
mineral
you're
going
to
have
or
anything
else
and
it's
talking
about
a
“prudent-man”
in
a
commercial
sense.
what
will
he
spend
his
money
on?
we
say
and
we
have
reiterated
throughout
and
have
often
reiterated
throughout
not
only
this
proceeding
but
in
all
discussions
with
this
matter
--
on
this
matter
with
members
of
the
mining
industry
and
with
people
that
we
do
business
with,
we
have
said
all
along
that
the
prudent
man
would
ask
himself
this
question.
now,
with
respect
to
copper,
i
note
that
in
the
morning
paper
that
one
of
the
big
companies
has
raised
the
price
of
copper
to
42
cents
a
pound.
you
can
look
in
the
bureau
of
mines
handbook,
which
is
a
publication
put
out
annually
by
the
bureau
of
mines
or
perhaps
at
intervals
every
year
or
so,
they
put
this
out
and
you
can
find
out
what
the
quotation
is
for
almost
all
minerals.
but
what
is
for
saying
in
graph?
what
is
it
for
building
stone?
no
one
knows.
so,
we
are
saying
something
--
incidentally,
there's
something
else.
if
you
have
copper,
you
can
sell
it
for
that.
if
you
have
gold,
you
can
sell
it
for
$35
an
ounce.
sometimes,
you
sell
it
for
more
but
you
can
sell
silver,
you
can
sell
all
of
the
metallic
minerals
and
most
of
the
non-common
variety
minerals
can
be
sold
in
various
places
in
the
country
at
a
price
that
you
can
ascertain
in
advance
and
that
we
can
ascertain
in
advance.
but
when
a
man
is
going
to
start
a
sand
and
gravel
operation
or
a
building
stone
operation,
we
don't
know
whether
he
is
going
to
be
able
to
sell
anything
or
not.
there
isn't
any
place
we
can
turn
to
see
what
the
quotation
is.
so,
we
have
required
only
that
he
presents
some
evidence
of
marketability.
now,
we're
still
talking
about
the
prudent-man.
so,
the
question
that
was
asked:
whether
we
could
think
about
a
prospective
market.
of
course,
we
can
but
it's
outside
this
case.
there
isn't
one
scrap
of
evidence
in
this
record
to
indicate
that
next
week
or
next
--
mr.
frank
j.
barry
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
frank
j.
barry
fine.
and
the
standard
that
we
--
mr.
frank
j.
barry
alright.
now,
we
said
“marketability”
–
ability
to
be
--
mr.
frank
j.
barry
of
the
brief
or
the
opinion?
mr.
frank
j.
barry
alright.
the
only
issue
in
dispute
at
the
hearing
on
september
16th
was
the
existence
of
a
market
for
profitable
sales
before
july
23,
1955.
now,
in
the
context
of
the
record,
as
i
say,
there's
nothing
in
the
evidence
to
show
that
the
marketability
is
going
to
be
any
different
next
week
or
next
week,
next
week
or
the
week
after
or
this
week.
now,
let
me
say
this:
if
evidence
was
shown
that
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
which
was
subsequent
to
1955,
the
evidence
was
admitted
as
to
what
was
marketed
afterwards,
evidence
was
admitted
as
to
what
demand
there
was
for
the
stone
afterwards,
that
evidence
would
relate
to
whether
or
not
this
stone
was
marketable
and
whether
it
could
have
been
marketed,
whether
it
had
the
ability
of
being
marketed
before
july
23.
and
that
evidence
had
to
be
in
the
record
in
order
to
establish
that
building
stone
was
a
locatable
mineral
on
that
date.
mr.
frank
j.
barry
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
frank
j.
barry
alright,
fine.
that
--
mr.
frank
j.
barry
that
point
is
well-made
and
if
that
point
had
been
in
the
record,
the
language
that
to
be
consistent
with
the
rule
of
the
department
of
interior
has
got
the
language
that
has
been
used
in
this
case
might
have
been
modified
to
say
something
like
this:
whether
there
was
before
july
23,
1955
evidence
that
the
stone
would
be
marketable,
not
in
the
present
but
possibly
in
the
future.
mr.
frank
j.
barry
alright,
but
the
evidence
in
this
case
--
mr.
frank
j.
barry
well,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
think
there
was
anything
in
our
opinion
the
truth
on
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
frank
j.
barry
now,
i
do
want
to
say
something
about
the
question
of
the
chief
--
mr.
frank
j.
barry
no,
it
is
not.
no,
i
think
that
was
i
beg
to
differ
with
counsel.
these
are
not
two
separate
arguments
and
for
this
reason,
it's
a
rather
complicated
little
point.
congress
declared
in
1955,
as
of
july
23,
1955,
that
building
that
stone,
we're
getting
out
of
the
argument
as
to
whether
it's
a
common
variety
of
whether
building
stone
was
included
for
the
moment
but
they
said
that
stone
could
no
longer
be
deemed
a
valuable
mineral
deposit.
now
after
my
discussion
with
mr.
justice
fortas,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
if
the
evidence
was
prior
to
1955,
that
one
could
reasonably
anticipate
that
he
could
market
a
stone,
he
would
have
been
a
prudent
man
to
make
an
investment.
that
might
have
been
what
we
would
have
said
and
we
might
have
validated
the
claims
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
frank
j.
barry
no,
it
doesn't
apply
to
any
kind
of
stone
whether
--
mr.
frank
j.
barry
alright,
let
me
tell
you
what
it
means.
the
55
acts
--
mr.
frank
j.
barry
alright,
fine.
the
act
says
that
“a
deposit
of
common
varieties
of
sand,
stone,
gravel,
pumice,
pumicite,
or
cinders
shall
not
be
deemed
a
valuable
mineral
deposit
within
the
meaning
of
the
mining
laws
of
the
united
states”.
now,
mind
you,
this
was
to
take
these
minerals
out
of
the
locatable
class
or
discoverable
class
after
1955,
but
it
didn't
effect
valid
mining
claims
theretofore
located.
in
other
words,
if
the
evidence
didn't
exist
that
before
1955,
before
this
date
in
1955,
a
man
could
have
marketed
his
stone
at
sometime
and
so
that
he
would
be
induced
as
a
prudent
man
to
invest
his
money,
then
if
afterwards
such
evidence
came
to
light
or
such
evidence
was
created
by
a
turn
of
events
that
suddenly
everybody
wanted
mark
–
wanted
quartzite
or
something
like
that
but
this
was
not
anticipatable
anything
else
in
advance,
he
can
no
longer
get
a
valid
mining
claim
for
building
stone,
if
this
is
a
building
stone.
that
is
the
point
that
i'm
making;
that
these
are
different,
these
are
really
different
issues.
the
first
issue
is
this:
that
before
if
it's
a
common
variety,
he
could
have
located
such
a
valuable
deposit,
he
could
have
located
it
before
1955.
if
it
was
a
common
variety
and
valuable
and
marketable
and
everything
else,
he
can't
locate
it
after
1955.
so
that
really,
we
have
two
questions
here.
the
case
was
tried
in
1958.
the
question
had
to
be:
did
he
have
a
valid
mining
claim
before
1955?
if
he
did,
he
gets
a
patent.
if
he
didn't,
he
doesn't.
it
doesn't
matter
if
something
develops
some
turn
of
events
that
wasn't
anticipated
before
1955,
it
doesn't
matter
that
if
in
the
future,
in
1970
or
1980,
that
suddenly
there
may
be
a
market
for
this
stone.
he
can
no
longer
locate,
he
can
no
longer
validate
his
claims.
thank
you.
mr.
frank
j.
barry
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
validity
of
the
decision
of
the
secretary
of
interior
which
invalidated
and
declared
null
and
void
18
mining
claims
in
the
san
bernardino
national
forest
about
40
miles
from
san
bernardino
on
the
crust
to
the
mountains
near
big
bear
lake.
the
claims
were
located
for
building
stone
and
they
were
located
in
1959,
in
1949,
1951
and
1952
by
mr.
and
mrs.
coleman.
the
claims
are
40
acres
each
and
they
extend
from
the
main
road,
which
is
the
main
road
to
big
bear
highway
no.
18
and
they
rise
up
on
a
mountain
with
a
southern
and
eastern
exposure
-
that
is
their
exposure
on
those
sides
of
the
mountain
-
overlooking
baldwin
lake,
in
the
distance
the
mojave
desert
and
overlooking
big
bear
lake.
claims
were
located
for
building
stone
and
the
principal
issue
in
the
case
has
to
do
with
whether
the
secretary
of
the
interior
applied
the
proper
rule
when
he
declared
that
the
time-honored,
prudent-manner
rule
included
a
rule
that
there
must
be
a
showing
that
the
mining
claims
or
that
the
product
of
the
mining
claims,
the
building
stone
could
have
been
marketed
prior
to
july
23,
1955,
the
date
of
the
multiple
use
act.
the
importance
of
that
date
is
as
follows.
the
multiple
use
act
declared
that
common
varieties
of
sand,
stone,
gravel
and
certain
other
minerals
could
no
longer
be
deemed
to
be
valuable
mineral
deposits
under
the
mining
law
so
that
the
discovery
of
such
commodities
on
the
public
land
would
give
one
the
right
to
locate
and
to
have
a
valid
mining
claim.
the
evidence
in
the
case
was
that
the
stone
was
quartzite.
quartzite
is
a
very
hard
mineral.
it
is
a
metamorphic
mineral,
a
mineral
that
has
been
created
by
forces
of
nature
acting
upon
sandstone.
quartzite
occurs
on
the
claims
in
large,
massive
chunks.
and
by
that,
i
mean
cliffs
in
the
mountain
itself
that
it
breaks
unpredictably;
that
is
to
say
it
doesn't
break
in
slabs.
it
breaks
in
any
direction
without
any
prediction
as
to
what
it
would
be,
but
it
is
quite
colorful.
there
are
some
pictures
that
indicate
that
it's
a
very
colorful
stone.
it
is
not
–
it's
got
very
dominant
colors
in
it
-
reds
and
yellows
and
browns;
they
are
very
strong
colors.
that
the
stone
has
been
used
and
it
locally
and
to
some
extent,
away
from
the
area
for
building;
that,
however,
it
is
an
unpopular
stone
in
the
industry.
one
of
the
witnesses
was
the
principal
executive
officer
or
western
representative
or
southern
representative
of
a
stone
marketing
company
who
testified
that
the
stone
was
unpopular;
that
the
stone
masons
didn't
like
to
use
it;
that
it
was
too
hard;
that
it
was
too
heavy;
that
it
dulled
the
tools
that
the
stone
masons
used;
that
there
haven't
been
any
call
for
it
for
sometime.
there
was
some
reference
to
a
call
about
six
months
ago
that
caused
into
make
an
inquiry
among
the
other
suppliers
to
know
if
any
was
available;
that
he
hadn't
stocked
it
for
years
and
that
there
wasn't
any
to
his
knowledge
being
stocked
elsewhere.
the
problem
of
marketability
is
related
to
the
rule,
the
prudent-man
rule,
which
is
the
rule
that's
been
applied
by
the
department
and
upheld
by
this
court,
is
related
to
the
rule.
indeed,
it
is
merely
an
application
of
the
rule
to
certain
types
of
minerals.
the
marketability
or
excuse
me,
the
prudent-man
rule
is
this:
that
one
does
not
have
a
valuable
discovery
which
is
essential
to
the
validity
of
a
mining
claim,
unless
he
has
within
the
limits
of
his
claim
an
exposure
of
mineral
and
evidence
that
a
man
of
ordinary
--
that
would
induce
a
man
of
ordinary
prudence
to
extend
his
energy
and
his
labor
and
his
means
with
a
reasonable
prospect
of
developing
a
valuable
mine.
this
is
the
one,
the
principal,
the
most
important
element
in
mining
laws
so
far
as
it
relates
to
the
public
domain.
by
failure
to
comply
with
this
particular
provision
of
mining
law
or
by
circumstances
that
do
not
qualify,
the
mining
claimant
is
denied
a
patent
which
gives
him
unrestricted
use
of
the
land.
he
obtains
the
title
in
fee
simple
without
any
reservation,
without
any
limitation
as
to
what
he
would
use
it
for.
he
becomes
the
owner
of
the
land.
indeed,
even
before
he
gets
a
patent,
he
has
practically
the
rights
of
a
patentee
with
the
exception
that
he
can't
market
timber
or
use
other
products
of
the
land
other
than
the
minerals,
the
--
except
in
connection
with
his
mining
operation,
the
prudent-man
rule
has
been
applied
over
the
years
and
from
the
earliest
time,
it
has
been
applied
with
special
reference
to
this
type
of
mineral,
which
occur
so
widely
that
to
say
merely
that
you
have
the
mineral
would
not
really
be
sufficient
to
say
that
you
can
actually
make
a
profit.
can
a
man,
when
he
stumbles
upon
a
deposit
of
sand,
justify
to
himself
the
expenditure
of
the
labor
and
the
means
necessary
to
develop
a
valuable
mine?
can
he
reasonably
do
this?
this
is
the
test
that
we
have
applied.
and
if
what
he
is
working
with
is
something
as
common
as
stone
or
sand
and
gravel,
the
department
has
required
for
years
that
there
be
a
showing
that
there
be
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
defendant
or
that
the
contestant
in
the
case
could
establish
that
he
was
able
to
extract
the
minerals
to
transport
them
to
market
and
to
dispose
of
them
in
the
marketplace
at
a
reasonable
profit
to
justify
his
effort
and
his
expenditure.
this
basically
is
the
prudent-man
rule.
this
is
the
rule
which,
as
extended
to,
minerals
of
this
character
is
known
as
the
rule
of
marketability.
mr.
frank
j.
barry
only
--
mr.
frank
j.
barry
the
ninth
circuit
has
indicated
in
its
opinion
that
what
was
required
by
us
was
an
actual
showing
that
there
had
been
minerals
marketed
at
a
profit
at
the
time
that
the
application
is
made.
all
the
we
required
is,
that
there
be
some
showing
that
you
could
market
it.
now,
that
would
included
indeed
some
showing,
for
example,
that
if
i
were
to
invest
my
money
today,
that
perhaps
next
saturday,
i
would
be
able
to
market
or
at
some
reasonable
time
in
the
future.
but
a
hypothetical
idea,
to
put
the
kind
of
money
it
would
take
into
the
development
of
a
mining
claim
to
develop
a
large
mine
for
sand
and
gravel
or
for
building
stone,
if
i'm
going
to
compete
with
everyone
across
the
road
and
on
the
same
side
of
the
road
as
i
am,
i
wouldn't
invest
that
money
unless
i
had
some
assurance
that
i
could
market
the
property.
i
assume
that
this
is
--
mr.
frank
j.
barry
..discussing
before
the
recess
the
fact
that
this
particular
stone
that
is
found
on
this
claim
has
not
been
--
is
not
marketable
in
the
area
of
southern
california
where
it's
located.
perhaps,
i
should
detail
a
bit
of
the
evidence
as
to
what
the
experience
of
this
particular
locator
has
been
on
the
claim.
over
the
period
of
ten
years
from
the
time
that
the
claims
were
originally
located
until
the
hearing,
he
had
sold
approximately
1,000
tons
of
the
stone
by
his
estimate
which
are
experts
estimated
was
approximately
correct
and
we
don't
question
and
that
he
got
an
average
of
$12
per
ton
for
that
thousand
tons.
so
that
his
total
revenue
from
the
property
with
respect
to
the
building
stone
alone
would
be
in
the
neighborhood
of
$12,000
over
a
period
of
10
years.
mr.
frank
j.
barry
that
appears
to
have
been
his
gross.
now,
he
expended
a
very
large
amount
of
money,
if
this
can
be
attributed
to
mining.
he
spent
a
great
deal
of
time,
which
was
estimated,
i
think
perhaps
the
court
could
be
justified
in
ignoring
the
enormous
size.
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
would
naturally
lend
itself
to
exaggeration.
he
valued
his
time
at
$3.50
an
hour
and
he
said
that
he
worked
300
days
a
year
and
that
so
many
hours
a
day
and
someone
multiplied
it
out
and
it
came
to
$157,000
but
this
is
what
he
had
been
spending
his
life
on
for
the
past
10
years
on
these
claims
and
this
is
the
amount
of
gross
sales
that
he
had
made.
in
addition,
he
had
expended
a
considerable
amount
of
money.
he
had
invested
money
in
equipment.
most
of
it
incidentally,
from
what
appears
on
the
record,
equipment
that
would
be
suitable
for
road
grading.
the
particular
work
that
was
done
on
the
claim
seems
not
to
have
been
strictly
speaking,
coring
work.
that
is
to
say
he
did
not
excavate
far
down
into
the
deposit
but
what
he
was
doing
was
selecting
from
the
rock
slides
in
a
broken
pieces
of
rock
that
are
found
rather
commonly
across
the
surface
of
the
claims.
he
was
picking
out
suitable
types
of
rocks,
sorting
them
out,
classifying
them
and
so
forth
and
he
would
sell
some
of
these
rocks.
and
as
i
say,
over
the
period
of
10
years,
he
sold
$12,000
worth
of
rock.
this
is
what
the
evidence
would
show.
mr.
frank
j.
barry
he
lived
on
the
land.
he
had
a
home
there
and
he
lived
there
with
his
wife.
there's
a
picture
of
the
home
in
the
record,
a
colored
picture
and
it
shows
it
to
be
a
quite
and
nice
little
piece
of
property
right
on
the
road.
there
are
number
of
roads
on
the
claims
that
--
i
don't
know
how
many
miles,
i
don't
know
that
the
record
shows.
i
know
that
it's
at
least
3
½
miles
of
roads
that
go
up
on
the
claim.
the
claim
covers
an
area
of
over
a
square
mile
or
720
acres
and
it's
approximately
--
well,
a
640
acres
to
a
claim
or
to
a
square
mile.
now,
the
department
of
interior
in
its
decision,
considered
how
much
he
had
marketed
of
this
stone
over
a
period
of
time,
all
of
which
was
in
the
record,
how
much
he
had
gotten
for
it,
how
much
labor
he
had
to
expend,
how
much
of
the
stone
there
was
in
the
neighborhood.
and
in
the
area
in
which
these
claims
are
located,
there
are
roughly
40,000
or
40
square
miles
to
28,000
acres
of
quartzite
exposed
about
a
thousand
feet
thick.
and
that's
enough
quartzite
to
stretch
from
here
to
there
or
some
all
sorts
of
statistics,
it
could
cover
the
district
of
columbia
or
third
of
the
district
of
columbia
to
a
depth
of
about
a
thousand
feet.
it
could
--
you
can
think
of
it
in
terms
of
an
enormous
amount
of
stone.
now,
most
of
the
operation
that
had
been
conducted
as
shown
by
the
evidence
was,
the
business
of
simply
sorting
the
stone
that
was
found
on
the
surface
-
that
is
to
say
he
picked
out
pieces
of
stone
that
would
be
suitable
for
a
particular
purpose.
in
other
words,
if
wanted
to
get
some
slabs,
he
would
look
around
until
he
found
pieces
that
broke
into
slabs
and
that
kind
of
thing.
and
these
stones
are
piled
up,
in
fact
i
think
there
are
some
pictures
in
the
record
that
show
that
they
were
piled
up
in
the
vicinity
of
his
home;
some
of
them
are
flat
and
so
forth
and
some
of
them
are
just
chunks.
but
most
of
the
stone,
the
evidence
showed,
is
the
type
that
is
massive
and
that
if
you
try
to
break
it,
it
breaks
in
an
unpredictable
way.
and
that
if
a
piece
doesn't
break
out,
suitable
for
the
purpose
that
you
need,
it
can
be
discarded
or
put
through
a
crasher
to
make
gravel
out
of
it
or
something
like
that,
but
it
wouldn't
have
any
particular
use
to
fill
a
particular
order.
now,
we
looked
at
this
case,
that
is
the
department
of
interior
who
looked
to
the
case,
made
a
determination
that
if
this
man
wanted
to
develop
a
mine
there
and
wanted
to
invest
the
kind
of
money
he
was
talking
about
to
start
at
the
top
and
work
down
that
whole
mountain
of
building
stone
that
he
could
not
have
had
a
market,
hot
for
that
quantity
but
not
for
any
kind
of
a
reasonable
operation.
he
could
not
have
had
a
market
for
his
product
of
his
claim.
and,
we
therefore
concluded
that
he
should
not
get
a
patent
to
the
public
domain
to
take
this
land
out
of
the
national
forest,
put
it
into
private
ownership
for
any
kind
of
use
because
it
was
very
likely,
notwithstanding
that
there's
no
limitation
on
what
a
man
does
with
property
after
he
gets
it,
that
a
prudent
miner
would
not
develop
this
property
for
a
mine.
and
that
is
what
we're
trying
to
administer
when
we
administered
the
mining
laws
in
the
department
of
interior.
the
original
law
was
passed
in
1872
at
the
time
when
the
country,
when
the
laws
of
the
country
were
intended
to
encourage
people
to
go
out
and
live
upon
the
land,
to
fill
up
the
country
with
people
so
there'd
be
some
people
living
out
there
in
these
areas
in
the
west.
so
there
was
lavishness
about
how
the
public
land
laws
were
administered.
now,
the
law
has
not
changed
but
times
have
changed.
and
i
don't
suggest
that
we
have
interpreted
the
laws
any
differently
than
they
have
been
interpreted
from
the
beginning
but
lots
of
things
have
changed.
nowadays,
there
are
all
kinds
of
demands
for
public
land
and
you
will
notice
in
the
briefs
that
had
been
filed
in
this
case
that
we
are
accused
of
having
engrafted
something
on
the
new
law,
something
that
isn't
authorized
by
congress
in
some
sense
that
we
may
have
violated
the
rights
of
the
contestee
in
this
case,
but
i
say
that
the
law
has
not
changed.
the
old
cases
support
the
proposition
that
one
is
not
entitled
to
obtain
land
from
the
united
states
from
the
public
domain,
unless
he
can
show
that
he
will
carry
out
a
policy
that
congress
was
trying
to
encourage,
for
example,
to
encourage
the
development
of
mineral
resources.
from
the
very
earliest
days,
we
had
the
rule
that
that
math
that
we
were
not
giving
a
mining
patent
to
someone
unless
on
an
objective
basis,
an
ordinary
prudent
man
would
be
one
who
would
spend
his
time
and
money
to
develop
the
property,
to
develop
a
mine.
that
was
the
rule
that
we
adopted
from
those
days.
now
i
say
that
times
have
changed,
because
now
there
are
lots
of
demands
for
lands
and
there's
a
great
deal
of
concern
for
land.
people
need
land
for
cities
and
for
highways
and
for
residences
and
for
all
kinds
of
purposes,
for
summer
homes
indeed
in
any
part
of
the
west.
and
because
times
have
changed,
there's
been
a
good
deal
more
strictness.
before
1910,
there
almost
was
never
a
mineral
examination
by
a
government
representative
when
if
someone
made
an
application
for
mining
claim.
that's
just
an
evidence
of
the
attitude
that
we
had
about
anyone
who
was
applying
for
a
mining
claim
in
those
days.
in
1910,
we
started
hiring
in
the
department
of
interior,
we
started
hiring
people
to
–
local
miners
to
kind
of
verify
if
the
allegations
that
were
made
in
patent
applications
and
tell
us
was
there
really
a
discovery,
are
these
people
really
entitled
to
get
a
patent.
about
1917,
the
department
started
hiring
full
time
mining
engineers
and
geologists
to
go
out
and
make
inspections
of
claims.
and
believe
it
or
not,
until
1940,
they
were
still
issuing
patents
without
any
mineral
inspection
of
the
claims
by
the
government
at
all,
but
i
think
the
times
have
changed.
that
mineral
examiners
have
become
more
particular.
they
have
insisted
that
they
see
on
the
ground
the
evidence
and
the
facts
that
justify
this
man's
claim
that
he
can
make
a
business
here
and
make
a
profit
at
his
business.
and,
lawyers
and
the
government
are
being
more
strict
in
the
application
of
rules
that
have
been
in
the
books
and
that
have
been
spelled
out
by
this
court
just
this
strictly
but
no
more
strictly
than
they're
being
applied
now.
in
the
cameron
case,
which
is
a
very
like
this
case,
a
case
in
which
the
department
had
declared
invalid
mining
claims
on
the
rim
of
the
grand
canyon.
mr.
cameron
refused
to
leave
the
property
as
did
mr.
coleman,
after
his
claims
had
been
made
--
declared
null
and
void
and
the
government
sued
in
the
nature
of
ejectment
and
in
that
case,
the
court
applied
a
strict
standard.
it
said,
you
have
to
have
a
discovery
and
the
evidence
has
to
be
such
that
a
reasonable
man
would
spend
his
time
and
money
with
a
prospect
of
developing
a
valuable
mine.
the
evidence
in
this
case
didn't
show
that.
the
circuit
court
has
said
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
the
department
of
interior,
had
rendered
a
decision
which
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
abuse
of
discretion.
and
for
what
i've
been
able
to
see
of
the
case
is
that
means
that
the
decision
that
has
been
rendered
in
the
department
was
irrational,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
a
reasonable
argument
that
we
would
ask
this
court
to
review
it.
i
would
like
--
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
would
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
--
mr.
frank
j.
barry
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
j.
barry
let
me
just
point
this.
i'm
sure
i
won't
need
to
state
to
you
how
the
department
of
interior
operates.
but
just
as
we
are
asking
this
court
to
reverse
the
ninth
circuit,
the
forest
service,
who
conducted
this
appeal
and
carried
on
the
prosecution
in
the
lower
court,
appealed
and
asked
the
secretary
to
reverse
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
land
management.
there
is
a
saying
in
the
department,
i
don't
know
if
its
common
in
government
at
all
but
you've
asked
me
if
it's
still
debated.
i
might
say
in
response
that
we
may
be
wrong,
but
we're
never
in
doubt.
but
we
are
--
and
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
question
about
it;
that
these
claims
cannot
be
marketed.
that
is
the
product
of
these
claims
cannot
be
mark
--
a
mine
cannot
be
developed
there.
it
would
cause
too
much
money
to
mine.
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
indicate
incidentally
that
one
could
mine
and
make
a
profit,
but
we're
saying
that
we
go
a
step
further.
the
evidence
that
we
have
is
that
you
could
not
mine
because
no
one
wants
to
buy
this
stone.
no
substantial
number
of
people
want
to
buy
this
stone,
certainly
not
enough
to
justify
the
united
states
in
disposing
of
such
a
large
tract
to
find
land.
mr.
frank
j.
barry
i'm
not
so
sure
that
there
would
be
--
i
think
that
the
ninth
circuit
misstated
what
the
department
of
interior
had
held.
and
if
i
can
refer
to
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit,
the
court
said
that,
“the
department
had
applied
a
rule
in
derogation
of
castle
against
womble
and
had
required
that,
castle
against
womble
is
the
old
case
of
1894
that
was
decided
in
the
department
of
interior,
that
we
had
applied
a
rule
that
was
in
derogation
of
castle
against
womble
and
had
required
a
showing
that
right
today,
that
presently,
the
man
was
making
a
profit.
we
did
not
make
any
such
--
we
did
not
apply
any
such
rule.
we
applied
the
rule
and
you
can
see
by
examining,
simply
they
had
note
in
the
case
that
we
--
that
was
decided
in
the
department.
they
had
noticed
this.
it
says,
“to
satisfy
the
requirement
for
a
discovery
on
a
building
stone
claim
located
before
july
23,
1955,
it
must
be
shown
that
the
exposed
materials
a
common
variety
of
stone
appearing
within
the
limits
of
the
claim,
could
have
been
extracted,
removed
and
marketed
at
a
profit
prior
to
that
date.
and
where
a
showing
is
not
made,
the
mining
claim
is
properly
declared
null
and
void.”
that
was
what
we
held.
and
what
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
we
held
was
that
we
had
required
that
there
be
a
showing
that
there
is
a
present
profit
being
made
by
the
contestee.
we
do
not
require
that.
our
marketability
test
does
not
require
that.
we
only
require
evidence
that
you
could
market
it
if
you
produced.
no
effort
was
made
to
do
anymore
than
that
in
the
trial
and
no
such
ruling
was
made
by
the
department.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i'd
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
frank
j.
barry
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
i
think
perhaps
i
have
to
clarify
the
present
marketability
rule
emphasize
again
what
i
said
before.
the
prudent-man
rule,
note:
“is
cast
in
terms
of
a
prudent-man”.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
kind
of
mineral
you're
going
to
have
or
anything
else
and
it's
talking
about
a
“prudent-man”
in
a
commercial
sense.
what
will
he
spend
his
money
on?
we
say
and
we
have
reiterated
throughout
and
have
often
reiterated
throughout
not
only
this
proceeding
but
in
all
discussions
with
this
matter
--
on
this
matter
with
members
of
the
mining
industry
and
with
people
that
we
do
business
with,
we
have
said
all
along
that
the
prudent
man
would
ask
himself
this
question.
now,
with
respect
to
copper,
i
note
that
in
the
morning
paper
that
one
of
the
big
companies
has
raised
the
price
of
copper
to
42
cents
a
pound.
you
can
look
in
the
bureau
of
mines
handbook,
which
is
a
publication
put
out
annually
by
the
bureau
of
mines
or
perhaps
at
intervals
every
year
or
so,
they
put
this
out
and
you
can
find
out
what
the
quotation
is
for
almost
all
minerals.
but
what
is
for
saying
in
graph?
what
is
it
for
building
stone?
no
one
knows.
so,
we
are
saying
something
--
incidentally,
there's
something
else.
if
you
have
copper,
you
can
sell
it
for
that.
if
you
have
gold,
you
can
sell
it
for
$35
an
ounce.
sometimes,
you
sell
it
for
more
but
you
can
sell
silver,
you
can
sell
all
of
the
metallic
minerals
and
most
of
the
non-common
variety
minerals
can
be
sold
in
various
places
in
the
country
at
a
price
that
you
can
ascertain
in
advance
and
that
we
can
ascertain
in
advance.
but
when
a
man
is
going
to
start
a
sand
and
gravel
operation
or
a
building
stone
operation,
we
don't
know
whether
he
is
going
to
be
able
to
sell
anything
or
not.
there
isn't
any
place
we
can
turn
to
see
what
the
quotation
is.
so,
we
have
required
only
that
he
presents
some
evidence
of
marketability.
now,
we're
still
talking
about
the
prudent-man.
so,
the
question
that
was
asked:
whether
we
could
think
about
a
prospective
market.
of
course,
we
can
but
it's
outside
this
case.
there
isn't
one
scrap
of
evidence
in
this
record
to
indicate
that
next
week
or
next
--
mr.
frank
j.
barry
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
frank
j.
barry
fine.
and
the
standard
that
we
--
mr.
frank
j.
barry
alright.
now,
we
said
“marketability”
–
ability
to
be
--
mr.
frank
j.
barry
of
the
brief
or
the
opinion?
mr.
frank
j.
barry
alright.
the
only
issue
in
dispute
at
the
hearing
on
september
16th
was
the
existence
of
a
market
for
profitable
sales
before
july
23,
1955.
now,
in
the
context
of
the
record,
as
i
say,
there's
nothing
in
the
evidence
to
show
that
the
marketability
is
going
to
be
any
different
next
week
or
next
week,
next
week
or
the
week
after
or
this
week.
now,
let
me
say
this:
if
evidence
was
shown
that
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
which
was
subsequent
to
1955,
the
evidence
was
admitted
as
to
what
was
marketed
afterwards,
evidence
was
admitted
as
to
what
demand
there
was
for
the
stone
afterwards,
that
evidence
would
relate
to
whether
or
not
this
stone
was
marketable
and
whether
it
could
have
been
marketed,
whether
it
had
the
ability
of
being
marketed
before
july
23.
and
that
evidence
had
to
be
in
the
record
in
order
to
establish
that
building
stone
was
a
locatable
mineral
on
that
date.
mr.
frank
j.
barry
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
frank
j.
barry
alright,
fine.
that
--
mr.
frank
j.
barry
that
point
is
well-made
and
if
that
point
had
been
in
the
record,
the
language
that
to
be
consistent
with
the
rule
of
the
department
of
interior
has
got
the
language
that
has
been
used
in
this
case
might
have
been
modified
to
say
something
like
this:
whether
there
was
before
july
23,
1955
evidence
that
the
stone
would
be
marketable,
not
in
the
present
but
possibly
in
the
future.
mr.
frank
j.
barry
alright,
but
the
evidence
in
this
case
--
mr.
frank
j.
barry
well,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
think
there
was
anything
in
our
opinion
the
truth
on
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
frank
j.
barry
now,
i
do
want
to
say
something
about
the
question
of
the
chief
--
mr.
frank
j.
barry
no,
it
is
not.
no,
i
think
that
was
i
beg
to
differ
with
counsel.
these
are
not
two
separate
arguments
and
for
this
reason,
it's
a
rather
complicated
little
point.
congress
declared
in
1955,
as
of
july
23,
1955,
that
building
that
stone,
we're
getting
out
of
the
argument
as
to
whether
it's
a
common
variety
of
whether
building
stone
was
included
for
the
moment
but
they
said
that
stone
could
no
longer
be
deemed
a
valuable
mineral
deposit.
now
after
my
discussion
with
mr.
justice
fortas,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
if
the
evidence
was
prior
to
1955,
that
one
could
reasonably
anticipate
that
he
could
market
a
stone,
he
would
have
been
a
prudent
man
to
make
an
investment.
that
might
have
been
what
we
would
have
said
and
we
might
have
validated
the
claims
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
frank
j.
barry
no,
it
doesn't
apply
to
any
kind
of
stone
whether
--
mr.
frank
j.
barry
alright,
let
me
tell
you
what
it
means.
the
55
acts
--
mr.
frank
j.
barry
alright,
fine.
the
act
says
that
“a
deposit
of
common
varieties
of
sand,
stone,
gravel,
pumice,
pumicite,
or
cinders
shall
not
be
deemed
a
valuable
mineral
deposit
within
the
meaning
of
the
mining
laws
of
the
united
states”.
now,
mind
you,
this
was
to
take
these
minerals
out
of
the
locatable
class
or
discoverable
class
after
1955,
but
it
didn't
effect
valid
mining
claims
theretofore
located.
in
other
words,
if
the
evidence
didn't
exist
that
before
1955,
before
this
date
in
1955,
a
man
could
have
marketed
his
stone
at
sometime
and
so
that
he
would
be
induced
as
a
prudent
man
to
invest
his
money,
then
if
afterwards
such
evidence
came
to
light
or
such
evidence
was
created
by
a
turn
of
events
that
suddenly
everybody
wanted
mark
–
wanted
quartzite
or
something
like
that
but
this
was
not
anticipatable
anything
else
in
advance,
he
can
no
longer
get
a
valid
mining
claim
for
building
stone,
if
this
is
a
building
stone.
that
is
the
point
that
i'm
making;
that
these
are
different,
these
are
really
different
issues.
the
first
issue
is
this:
that
before
if
it's
a
common
variety,
he
could
have
located
such
a
valuable
deposit,
he
could
have
located
it
before
1955.
if
it
was
a
common
variety
and
valuable
and
marketable
and
everything
else,
he
can't
locate
it
after
1955.
so
that
really,
we
have
two
questions
here.
the
case
was
tried
in
1958.
the
question
had
to
be:
did
he
have
a
valid
mining
claim
before
1955?
if
he
did,
he
gets
a
patent.
if
he
didn't,
he
doesn't.
it
doesn't
matter
if
something
develops
some
turn
of
events
that
wasn't
anticipated
before
1955,
it
doesn't
matter
that
if
in
the
future,
in
1970
or
1980,
that
suddenly
there
may
be
a
market
for
this
stone.
he
can
no
longer
locate,
he
can
no
longer
validate
his
claims.
thank
you.
