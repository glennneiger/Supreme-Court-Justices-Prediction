justice

fortas
mr.
barry,
i
notice
that
the
examiner
and
the
acting
director
of
the
bureau
of
land
management,
each
of
those
in
different
ways,
said
that
the
necessary
showing
had
been
made
with
respect
to
certain
of
the
18
claims
here.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
secretary
ruled
that
the
requisite
showing
had
not
been
made
with
respect
to
any
of
the
claims.
now,
is
that
still
debated
as
to
whether
it's
still
a
factual
controversy
as
to
whether
necessary
showing
has
made
as
to
certain
of
the
claims?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
twitty,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
does
the
mining
claim,
even
one
would
relate
to
building
stone
have
to
be
claim
for
valuable
mineral
deposits,
translating
that
a
“valuable
deposit
of
building
stone”?
justice
abe
fortas
but
does
that
mean
that
the
building
stone
has
to
be
valuable?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
do
you
agree
that
that
applies
to
building
stone?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
--
and
let
me
see
if
i
will
get
a
little
more
clarity
on
my
own
mind.
is
there
an
issue
which
you
are
tendering?
now,
this
sort,
do
you
contend
that
you
don't
have
to
show
that
the
building
stone
is
valuable
but
that
the
land
is
chiefly
valuable
for
building
stone;
that
there
is
a
difference
between
those
two
standards?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
that
if
the
land
is
absolutely
useless
except
for
the
building
stone
and
the
building
stone
in
totality
for
the
--
for
all
of
the
claims
as
worth
a
thousand
dollars,
you
would
say
that's
enough.
you
don't
have
to
show
that
the
building
stone
is
capable
of
being
mined
and
sold?
justice
abe
fortas
and
there's
no
precedent
to
your
theory,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
solicitor,
by
correctly
understand
him,
braced
with
that,
doesn't
he?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
he
said
that
test
that
they
applied
here
was
a
prudent-man
test;
that
is
to
say
that
it
must
be
a
deposit
or
in
your
case,
in
occurrence
of
building
stone
which
the
characteristics
of
which
are
such
that
a
man
of
ordinary
prudence
would
spend
his
time
and
money
to
develop
it.
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
you
said
that
i
understand
them
to
say
that
that
is
to
test
him;
that's
test
was
applied
here.
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
is
whether
we're
really
dealing,
assuming
we
get
beyond
your
first
point
which
is
that
if
the
land
is
chiefly
viable
for
building
stone
that
then
means
some
indifferent
from
our
valuable
deposit
of
stone.
we
get
test
and
i
don't
agree
with
you
on
that.
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
whether
we
then
confront
a
difference
between
you
and
the
solicitor
with
respect
to
the
standard
to
be
applied
or
a
difference
between
you
and
the
solicitor
with
respect
to
its
application
in
this
particular
case.
justice
abe
fortas
you’re
saying
that
their
brief,
the
government
brief
says
that
present
marketability
is
or
is
not
the
proper
test.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
talking
about
their
opinion
or
their
brief
in
this
court?
justice
abe
fortas
brief
in
this
court.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
anything
in
that
opinion
except
to
that
effect
as
i
accept
the
sentence
that
appears
at
the
bottom,
page
12
of
the
record
–
bottom
of
page
12
of
the
appendix
that
we
have
before
us
and
that
says
that
coleman
was
required
to
show
that
by
reason
of
all
pertinent
factors
including
the
existence
of
a
present
demand
before
july
23,
1955,
the
deposit
could
be
mined,
removed
and
disposed
of
at
a
profit.
is
there
anything
else
in
the
opinion
other
than
that
that
supports
your
position
and
that
of
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
they
are
certainly
saying
that
that
is
a
pertinent
factor
and
that's
i
--
it
seems
to
me
quiet
clear
that
this
is
not
a
model
of
precision,
this
language
that
you
and
i
have
been
discussing.
and
on
the
other
hand,
at
page
12
of
the
government's
brief,
they
take
a
position
four
square
fair
list
is
clearly
in
favor
of
the
marketability
test
rather
than
the
present
market
test.
justice
abe
fortas
page
12
of
their
brief.
as
distinguished,
i
would
say
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
as
distinguished
from
or
the
rather
unclear
language
in
the
acting
--
in
the
deputy
solicitor's
opinion
on
the
same
issue.
justice
abe
fortas
but
there,
they
are
talking
about
perspective
marketability
as
they
make
clear,
i
think
that
was
where
in
particular
at
page
12.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
believe
that's
quite
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
think
it's
quite
that,
mr.
barry.
the
question
is
whether
what
was
the
standard
that
you
used
in
your
opinion?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
the
standard
you
used
in
your
opinion,
i
have
to
say
is
--
was
not
expressed
with
the
typical
interior
department
clarity.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
you
didn't
get
it.
you
look
at
page
12
on
the
record
and
look
at
the
first
sentence
to
which
mr.
twitty
called
our
attention
to.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
the
record,
the
appendix
of
the
record.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
agree
with
you.
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
quite
conceivable
as
a
theoretical
matter
anyway
that
no
evidence
could
have
been
adduced
to
show
that
there
was
a
market
on
or
before
july
1955
but
that
the
evidence
might
have
been
present,
showing
that
to
a
reasonably
prudent
man,
this
building
stone
might
be
saleable
in
a
year.
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
that
conceivable?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
a
very
different
matter,
that's
right.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
think
that's
what
--
i
think
when
you
and
i
are
talking
about
now
is
what
true
at
the
ninth
circuit.
