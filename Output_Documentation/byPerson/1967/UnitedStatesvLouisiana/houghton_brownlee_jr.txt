mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
the
court
please.
i'd
like
to
point
out
first
of
all
that
on
our
brief
we
had
as
our
counsel,
the
former
governor
and
senator
from
texas,
price
daniel.
we
were
very
sorry
that
he
was
unable
to
make
this
argument
this
morning
for
this
day
but
he
has
accepted
a
job
for
the
president
and
he
had
to
refuse
himself.
but
i
can
assure
you
that
every
word
in
there,
in
our
brief
has
his
thorough
thought
in
backing
and
it's
just
as
if
he
were
here
today
as
far
as
our
brief
is
concerned.
i'm
sorry
that
we
missed
on
having
the
benefit
of
this
argument.
this
leads
me
to
our
first
point
and
let
me
simply
state
our
position.
it's
very
simple.
texas'
position
is
that
the
california
case
did
settle
this
issue.
we
think
that
inland
waters
are
involved
here
and
that
we
have
an
inland
water
problem
and
that
this
is
a
key
just
it
was
--
as
it
was
in
the
california
case
to
a
proper
decision
by
the
court
for
arriving
at
our
coastline
as
defined
in
the
submerged
lands
act.
now,
the
government
has
apparently
taken
the
position
that
well,
we
must
go
back
to
1845.
why,
because
that
--
prior
to
that
time
we
had
an
old
boundary
act
on
the
republic
statute
books.
of
course
we
were
here
in
1947
urging
this
court
to
accept
that
old
boundary
act
as
our
proper
boundary
and
the
court
turned
it
down.
it
was
rejected
and
the
court
said,
"we
never
had
any
title
out
there".
when
we
joined
the
union
we
lost
it.
so
whatever
grant
we
got
came
from
the
submerged
lands
act
it
did
not
come
from
the
old
boundary
act
of
the
original
republic
of
texas.
it
came
strictly
from
the
submerged
lands
act
from
the
congress.
now,
our
position
is
simply
this
that
the
congress
intended
only
one
baseline
or
coastline
for
all
of
the
gulf
coast
of
states.
whether
the
gulf
of
mexico
or
the
atlantic
or
the
pacific
coast
or
how
could
congress
had
known
in
the
first
place,
which
of
the
states
if
any
on
the
gulf
coast
might
be
able
to
prove
up
some
additional
historic
distance.
we
say
that
the
word
historic
boundary
as
that
term
was
used
in
debate
and
so
forth
refers
to
historic
distance.
it
was
used
with
reference
to
california.
it
was
used
with
reference
to
louisiana.
it
was
used
with
reference
to
all
of
the
states
not
just
the
state
of
texas
or
the
state
of
florida.
so
that
we
do
not
see
how
the
government
gets
this
--
out
of
this
particular
part
of
the
statute
that
they
quote.
now,
let's
look
at
again
section
2
and
i'm
not
going
to
read
the
whole
thing
but
i
merely
want
to
point
out
that
it
gives
each
state
and
this
is
all
at
the
same
time
three
miles
from
the
coast
then
it
says,
"and
to
such
additional
historic
distance"
and
i'm
interpolating
here.
that's
the
way
we
read
the
act
as
the
state
may
prove
of.
it
does
not
say
that
you
have
to
back
up,
switch
around
and
start
out
with
an
entirely
new
baseline
if
you
are
fortunate
enough
to
be
able
to
prove
up
an
additional
historic
distance.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
that's
correct
and
i
think
what
they
were
referring
to
there
was
the
historic
distance
and
the
historic
boundary.
i'll
tell
you
why
i
think
so
and
why
i
think
this
is
important
to
keep
in
mind.
there
was
an
effort
on
the
part
of
louisiana
and
if
you
go
back
and
read
the
california
case,
the
court
went
into
this
history
in
great
detail.
louisiana
did
want
an
option.
they
did
think
that
they
would
have
an
additional
step
out,
like
they
could
get
a
big
advantage
out
of
this
if
they
had
an
option
of
either
relying
on
the
ancient
boundary
or
the
present
coastline
regardless
of
whether
that
can
prove
their
historic
distance
or
the
--
in
the
additional
three
miles
or
not.
well,
of
course
the
congress
turned
this
down.
it
never
got
into
the
act.
that
does
not
say
you
can
either
do
this
or
do
that.
it
merely
defines
coastline
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
decree
in
this
case
and
in
the
california
case
adopted
those
very
words
in
defining
coastlines
and
in
defining
where
inland
waters
commence
where
we
start
measuring
from.
now,
i
would
like
to
clear
one
item
that
was
brought
up.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
i
think
it
but
--
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
i
think
coastline,
it
means
where
you
start
measuring
the
grant
from
your
honor.
that's
what
i
think
it
means.
i
think
it
is
(inaudible)
with
the
baseline.
it
was
in
the
california
case.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
well,
certainly
you
could
say,
you
could
take
the
view
that
a
coastline
puts
some
sort
of
a
limit
on
it
but
it
is
where
you
start
measuring
from
i
think
and
certainly
you
would
not
measure
it
from
inner
limit
of
inland
waters.
you
have
to
get
to
the
outer
limit
before
you
commence
measuring
grants,
it
seems
to
me.
and
none
of
the
convention
the
waters
within
these
jetties
are
within
inland
waters
and
we
have
stipulated
that
this
particular
harbor-works
would
qualify
under
the
convention
as
that
type
of
harbor
work
that
would
be
assimilated
to
the
coast.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
no
sir,
not
at
all.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
one
of
the
stipulations
which
we
have
filed
with
the
court,
stipulation
number
three
which
i
now
read
that
jetties
at
sabine
pass
and
galveston
harbor
are
permanent
harbor-works
constituting
integral
parts
of
the
harbor
system
within
the
meaning
of
article
8
of
the
conventional
(inaudible).
there's
no
issue
on
that.
that
i
suppose
might
be
a
fact
issue.
there
are
no
fact
issues
in
this
case
as
we
see
it.
we
stipulated
to
the
plain
facts
that
the
jetties
weren't
there
in
1845.
they
weren't
--
they
were
completed
about
1909
as
a
matter
of
fact,
galveston
and
the
ones
that
sabine
pass
before
the
turn
of
the
century,
they've
been
there
a
long,
long
time.
they've
been
repaired
and
so
forth
but
in
their
present
form
as
they
are
now,
we
also
stipulated
that
they
were
there
and
exist
in
their
present
form
in
1953
when
the
submerged
lands
act
was
passed
if
that's
a
relevant
date.
the
reason
i
point
this
out
is
that
in
the
california
case,
this
court
will
remember
the
government
first
took
the
position
before
the
submerged
lands
act
was
passed
and
while
the
case
was
before
the
special
master
that
california
was
relegated
to
its
ancient
historic
boundary,
the
1850
date
of
admission
boundary
and
that
no
harbor-works
or
other
structures
built
since
that
time
should
be
included
within
the
state
of
california.
then
after
the
submerged
lands
act
was
passed,
the
government
conceded
that
time
that
yes,
it
was
the
intention
of
the
act
not
to
go
back
to
1850
but
get
up
to
18
--
19
--
to
1953
and
stop
right
there.
in
other
words,
they
conceded
that
it
was
the
intention
of
congress
to
go
ahead
and
see
to
the
state
all
harbor-works
or
built
up
land
or
anything
of
that
nature
that
existed
as
of
the
date
of
the
passage
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
many
references
were
made
in
their
briefs
and
i'm
not
going
to
quote
them
here,
they
are
quoted
in
our
brief
but
to
the
fact
that
the
gift
was
a
present
gift
and
so
forth
and
that
no
future
build
up
should
be
acquired
by
california.
they
were
willing
to
stop
there.
then
as
recently
as
--
well,
it
was
just
a
year
or
so
ago,
they
agreed
with
louisiana
that
off
their
coast.
they
would
go
ahead
and
accept
the
jetties
at
(inaudible)
pass
has
formed
the
part
of
the
baseline
or
the
coast
and
if
the
waters
were
inland
waters
within
those
jetties.
so
we
are
faced
really
--
we're
really
almost
back
to
the
original
1947
california
contention
of
the
ancient
boundary
because
of
the
historic
boundary
idea,
because
they're
claiming
that
we
have
to
go
back
to
1845
when
they
admit
that
we
can't
find
it.
we
don't
know
where
it
was.
we
have
no
adequate
maps
or
anything
to
let
us
know
where
it
was.
i
just
can't
see
this
from
their
reading
of
this
one
paragraph
out
of
the
act
levered
and
twisted
just
exactly
to
give
it
this
interpretation
when
there
are
so
many
other
things
in
the
act
itself
and
in
the
history
of
the
act
to
indicate
the
congress
was
talking
about
present
boundaries,
a
modern
coastline
and
not
an
ancient
coastline.
for
example
and
we
pointed
out
the
language,
the
terms
are
in
present
--
it's
not
on
either
are,
it's
not
as
they
did
exist
back
in
1845.
there's
nothing
to
tie
it
down
to
an
ancient
boundary.
in
fact
everything
indicates
that
the
concept
that
everyone
had
was
not
to
get
involved
in
all
of
the
difficulties
that
would
necessarily
be
involved
in
attempting
to
fix
an
ancient
coastline.
i
think
this
court
very
properly
and
very
wisely
took
the
view
in
the
california
case
that
a
modern
coastline
concept
was
exactly
what
the
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
passed
the
act
that
the
court
itself
was
given
the
job,
the
responsibility
of
making
those
definitions.
the
court
did
make
those
definitions
in
the
california
case
and
they
said
we
adopt
them
for
the
purpose
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
yes.
i
think
the
entire
act
was
in
terms
of
a
present
grant
as
far
as
that's
concern.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
yes
sir
or
as
we
say
historic
distance,
the
three
league
boundary.
the
act
didn't
purport
to
say
where
you
measure
the
boundary
from
except
that
it
did
define
coastline
and
that's
our
position.
and
we
say
you
don't
go
back
and
substitute
shoreline
or
coastline
when
you
apply
the
act
to
texas.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
i
think
it
shows
where
the
grant
starts
from
your
honor.
that's
what
i
believe
its
--
what
the
coastline
means.
i
would
also
point
out
to
the
court
that
--
and
this
again
goes
back
to
the
history
of
the
california
case
that
when
the
government
first
filed
its
complaint
in
a
motion
for
relief,
file
a
complaint
in
the
california
case.
it
specifically
excluded
harbor-works.
these
were
left
out
of
the
case.
so
the
decree
left
them
out.
and
when
we
got
to
the
1947
--
i
mean
the
1950
case
in
texas
and
louisiana,
the
same
pattern
was
followed
and
the
decree
left
that
in.
it
was
never
anything
that
took
away
from
texas
what
was
left
by
the
decree
and
that
included
all
the
harbor-works,
all
of
the
inland
waters
and
of
course
the
jetties
were
there
at
that
time.
so
as
far
as
the
grant
is
concern,
we
think
we
got
our
grant
from
the
submerged
lands
act
of
a
historic
distance
of
three
leagues,
measured
from
a
modern
coastline.
now,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
in
order
for
the
plaintiff
to
get
to
their
alternative
point
number
two
that
they
must
establish
their
first
point
which
is
the
ancient
boundary
theory.
in
other
words,
you
don't
get
to
the
alternative
until
you
prove
your
first
premise.
that's
absolutely
nothing
in
the
act
that
we've
been
able
to
find
or
in
the
legislative
history
that
would
indicate
this
sort
of
intent
in
the
part
of
congress.
mr.
crawford
martin,
the
attorney
general
of
texas
would
like
to
now
address
the
court
on
some
specific
matters.
thank
you.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
the
court
please.
i'd
like
to
point
out
first
of
all
that
on
our
brief
we
had
as
our
counsel,
the
former
governor
and
senator
from
texas,
price
daniel.
we
were
very
sorry
that

accepted

this
leads
me
to
our

let
me
simply
state

it's
very

texas'

is
that

the

no

mr.
houghton
brownlee,

yes,
that's
right.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
that's
correct
and
i
think
what
they
were
referring
to
there
was
the
historic
distance
and
the
historic
boundary.
i'll
tell
you
why
i
think
so
and
why
i
think
this
is
important
to
keep
in
mind.
there
was
an
effort
on
the
part
of
louisiana
and
if
you
go
back
and
read
the
california
case,
the
court
went
into
this
history
in
great
detail.
louisiana
did
want
an
option.
they
did
think
that
they
would
have
an
additional
step
out,
like
they
could
get
a
big
advantage
out
of
this
if
they
had
an
option
of
either
relying
on
the
ancient
boundary
or
the
present
coastline
regardless
of
whether
that
can
prove
their
historic
distance
or
the
--
in
the
additional
three
miles
or
not.
well,
of
course
the
congress
turned
this
down.
it
never
got
into
the
act.
that
does
not
say
you
can
either
do
this
or
do
that.
it
merely
defines
coastline
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
decree
in
this
case
and
in
the
california
case
adopted
those
very
words
in
defining
coastlines
and
in
defining
where
inland
waters
commence
where
we
start
measuring
from.
now,
i
would
like
to
clear
one
item
that
was
brought
up.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
i
think
it
but
--
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
i
think
coastline,
it
means
where
you
start
measuring
the
grant
from
your
honor.
that's
what
i
think
it
means.
i
think
it
is
(inaudible)
with
the
baseline.
it
was
in
the
california
case.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
well,
certainly
you
could
say,
you
could
take
the
view
that
a
coastline
puts
some
sort
of
a
limit
on
it
but
it
is
where
you
start
measuring
from
i
think
and
certainly
you
would
not
measure
it
from
inner
limit
of
inland
waters.
you
have
to
get
to
the
outer
limit
before
you
commence
measuring
grants,
it
seems
to
me.
and
none
of
the
convention
the
waters
within
these
jetties
are
within
inland
waters
and
we
have
stipulated
that
this
particular
harbor-works
would
qualify
under
the
convention
as
that
type
of
harbor
work
that
would
be
assimilated
to
the
coast.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
no
sir,
not
at
all.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
one
of
the
stipulations
which
we
have
filed
with
the
court,
stipulation
number
three
which
i
now
read
that
jetties
at
sabine
pass
and
galveston
harbor
are
permanent
harbor-works
constituting
integral
parts
of
the
harbor
system
within
the
meaning
of
article
8
of
the
conventional
(inaudible).
there's
no
issue
on
that.
that
i
suppose
might
be
a
fact
issue.
there
are
no
fact
issues
in
this
case
as
we
see
it.
we
stipulated
to
the
plain
facts
that
the
jetties
weren't
there
in
1845.
they
weren't
--
they
were
completed
about
1909
as
a
matter
of
fact,
galveston
and
the
ones
that
sabine
pass
before
the
turn
of
the
century,
they've
been
there
a
long,
long
time.
they've
been
repaired
and
so
forth
but
in
their
present
form
as
they
are
now,
we
also
stipulated
that
they
were
there
and
exist
in
their
present
form
in
1953
when
the
submerged
lands
act
was
passed
if
that's
a
relevant
date.
the
reason
i
point
this
out
is
that
in
the
california
case,
this
court
will
remember
the
government
first
took
the
position
before
the
submerged
lands
act
was
passed
and
while
the
case
was
before
the
special
master
that
california
was
relegated
to
its
ancient
historic
boundary,
the
1850
date
of
admission
boundary
and
that
no
harbor-works
or
other
structures
built
since
that
time
should
be
included
within
the
state
of
california.
then
after
the
submerged
lands
act
was
passed,
the
government
conceded
that
time
that
yes,
it
was
the
intention
of
the
act
not
to
go
back
to
1850
but
get
up
to
18
--
19
--
to
1953
and
stop
right
there.
in
other
words,
they
conceded
that
it
was
the
intention
of
congress
to
go
ahead
and
see
to
the
state
all
harbor-works
or
built
up
land
or
anything
of
that
nature
that
existed
as
of
the
date
of
the
passage
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
many
references
were
made
in
their
briefs
and
i'm
not
going
to
quote
them
here,
they
are
quoted
in
our
brief
but
to
the
fact
that
the
gift
was
a
present
gift
and
so
forth
and
that
no
future
build
up
should
be
acquired
by
california.
they
were
willing
to
stop
there.
then
as
recently
as
--
well,
it
was
just
a
year
or
so
ago,
they
agreed
with
louisiana
that
off
their
coast.
they
would
go
ahead
and
accept
the
jetties
at
(inaudible)
pass
has
formed
the
part
of
the
baseline
or
the
coast
and
if
the
waters
were
inland
waters
within
those
jetties.
so
we
are
faced
really
--
we're
really
almost
back
to
the
original
1947
california
contention
of
the
ancient
boundary
because
of
the
historic
boundary
idea,
because
they're
claiming
that
we
have
to
go
back
to
1845
when
they
admit
that
we
can't
find
it.
we
don't
know
where
it
was.
we
have
no
adequate
maps
or
anything
to
let
us
know
where
it
was.
i
just
can't
see
this
from
their
reading
of
this
one
paragraph
out
of
the
act
levered
and
twisted
just
exactly
to
give
it
this
interpretation
when
there
are
so
many
other
things
in
the
act
itself
and
in
the
history
of
the
act
to
indicate
the
congress
was
talking
about
present
boundaries,
a
modern
coastline
and
not
an
ancient
coastline.
for
example
and
we
pointed
out
the
language,
the
terms
are
in
present
--
it's
not
on
either
are,
it's
not
as
they
did
exist
back
in
1845.
there's
nothing
to
tie
it
down
to
an
ancient
boundary.
in
fact
everything
indicates
that
the
concept
that
everyone
had
was
not
to
get
involved
in
all
of
the
difficulties
that
would
necessarily
be
involved
in
attempting
to
fix
an
ancient
coastline.
i
think
this
court
very
properly
and
very
wisely
took
the
view
in
the
california
case
that
a
modern
coastline
concept
was
exactly
what
the
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
passed
the
act
that
the
court
itself
was
given
the
job,
the
responsibility
of
making
those
definitions.
the
court
did
make
those
definitions
in
the
california
case
and
they
said
we
adopt
them
for
the
purpose
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
yes.
i
think
the
entire
act
was
in
terms
of
a
present
grant
as
far
as
that's
concern.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
yes
sir
or
as
we
say
historic
distance,
the
three
league
boundary.
the
act
didn't
purport
to
say
where
you
measure
the
boundary
from
except
that
it
did
define
coastline
and
that's
our
position.
and
we
say
you
don't
go
back
and
substitute
shoreline
or
coastline
when
you
apply
the
act
to
texas.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
i
think
it
shows
where
the
grant
starts
from
your
honor.
that's
what
i
believe
its
--
what
the
coastline
means.
i
would
also
point
out
to
the
court
that
--
and
this
again
goes
back
to
the
history
of
the
california
case
that
when
the
government
first
filed
its
complaint
in
a
motion
for
relief,
file
a
complaint
in
the
california
case.
it
specifically
excluded
harbor-works.
these
were
left
out
of
the
case.
so
the
decree
left
them
out.
and
when
we
got
to
the
1947
--
i
mean
the
1950
case
in
texas
and
louisiana,
the
same
pattern
was
followed
and
the
decree
left
that
in.
it
was
never
anything
that
took
away
from
texas
what
was
left
by
the
decree
and
that
included
all
the
harbor-works,
all
of
the
inland
waters
and
of
course
the
jetties
were
there
at
that
time.
so
as
far
as
the
grant
is
concern,
we
think
we
got
our
grant
from
the
submerged
lands
act
of
a
historic
distance
of
three
leagues,
measured
from
a
modern
coastline.
now,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
in
order
for
the
plaintiff
to
get
to
their
alternative
point
number
two
that
they
must
establish
their
first
point
which
is
the
ancient
boundary
theory.
in
other
words,
you
don't
get
to
the
alternative
until
you
prove
your
first
premise.
that's
absolutely
nothing
in
the
act
that
we've
been
able
to
find
or
in
the
legislative
history
that
would
indicate
this
sort
of
intent
in
the
part
of
congress.
mr.
crawford
martin,
the
attorney
general
of
texas
would
like
to
now
address
the
court
on
some
specific
matters.
thank
you.
