justice
abe
fortas
mr.
claiborne,
i
understand
that
your
position
is
that
the
principle
announced
by
this
court
in
united
states
against
california
should
not
be
applied
here,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i
think
i
understand
that
but
will
you
tell
me
again
why
you
think
--
why
is
it
that
you
think
that
the
principle
in
united
states
against
california
should
not
apply
to
the
three-league
as
against
the
three-mile
comparison?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
your
argument
and
it
must
be
based
squarely
upon
some
language
in
the
statute,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
and
would
you
please
show
me
what
that
language
is?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
say
that's
--
means
the
present
coastline
the
united
states
against
california
defines
it?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
you're
doing
as
i
understand
it
is
to
say
that
the
first
views
in
that
phrase
into
the
boundary
line
of
each
such
state
has
to
be
read
as
if
it
said
in
the
boundary
line
of
each
such
state
as
it
existed
at
the
time
that
the
state
became
a
member
of
the
union.
justice
abe
fortas
where
in
any
case
--
justice
abe
fortas
sir?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
well
that's
your
argument.
i
just
want
to
be
clear
that
you
are
reading
it
to
mean
"and
to
the
boundary
line
of
each
such
state
as
it
existed"
and
not
merely
because
i
assume
that
the
argument
of
texas
is
at
the
phrase
where
in
any
such
case,
such
boundary
as
it
existed
does
not
qualify
the
meaning
of
boundary
line
in
the
preceding
phrases
where
it
complicated
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
argument
as
i
--
that's
the
issue
as
i
understand
it.
would
you
agree
or
disagree
with
that?
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
make
that
motion
--
in
the
form
of
motion?
is
it
set
on
your
brief
or
does
it
appear
in
any
of
the
written
papers
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
--
well,
i
understood
that
to
be
your
position
but
perhaps
i
misunderstood
what
you
said
a
few
moments
ago.
i
thought
a
few
moments
ago,
you
just
said
flatly
that
you
think
that
the
decision
in
the
pending
case
ought
to
be
referred
until
your
submission
is
completed.
justice
abe
fortas
we
have
nothing
in
writing
to
reflect
this
view
of
the
state
of
louisiana
or
arrived
that
after
you
saw
the
texas
brief,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
not
affirmed.
may
i
mr.
claiborne,
with
respect
to
your
last
remark,
in
your
principal
argument
you
said
that
the
boundary
could
be
reset
from
time
to
time.
now,
do
you
take
that
position
with
respect
to
california?
or
to
put
it
another
way,
would
you
take
that
position
if
we
should
decide
in
favor
of
texas
here
or
are
you
limiting
a
possibility
of
redetermination
to
ambulatory
changes?
justice
abe
fortas
for
purposes
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
of
this
act?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
