justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
the
measure
mr.
claiborne
of
the
difference
between
the
1845
where
the
1845
line
would
be
and
from
which
texas
contends
the
measurement
should
be?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
we
know
where
the
natural
--
is
the
--
what's
the
distance
from
the
point
where
the
natural
shoreline
was
in
1845
and
where
the
natural
shoreline
would
be
today,
do
you
know?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
claiborne,
i
gather
there's
no
--
you
make
no
point
of
the
fact
that
we're
dealing
here
with
the
gulf
rather
than
the
coastline.
i
mean
we're
dealing
here
with
the
coastline
on
the
gulf
of
mexico,
aren't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
you're
not
--
of
course,
you
--
that
you're
not
distinguishing
the
california
case
and
that
granted
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
because
the
submerged
lands
act
made
that
depend
on
history.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
see
now
mr.
attorney
general.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
your
jetties
here
at
galveston
were
to
be
extended
out
another
mile.
i
don't
know
whether
that's
possible
if
they
were
next
year,
could
you
then
say
that
the
texas
boundary
will
not
steal
another
mile
within
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
claiborne
may
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
take
the
contrary
position
in
the
california
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
that
--
do
you
think
we
clearly
ruled
that
it
would
be
an
ambulatory
boundary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
--
what
about
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
a
new
harbor-work?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
because
the
treaty
would
do
it
that
way.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
well,
i
asked
the
question
whether
--
supposed
you
extended
the
galveston
jetty
a
mile
out
further.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
the
measure
mr.
claiborne
of
the
difference
between
the
1845
where
the
1845
line
would
be
and
from
which
texas
contends
the
measurement
should
be?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
we
know
where
the
natural
--
is
the
--
what's
the
distance
from
the
point
where
the
natural
shoreline
was
in
1845
and
where
the
natural
shoreline
would
be
today,
do
you
know?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
claiborne,
i
gather
there's
no
--
you
make
no
point
of
the
fact
that
we're
dealing
here
with
the
gulf
rather
than
the
coastline.
i
mean
we're
dealing
here
with
the
coastline
on
the
gulf
of
mexico,
aren't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
you're
not

of

justice
william

mr.

i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
take
the
contrary
position
in
the
california

justice
william
j.
brennan,

would
that
--
do
you
think
we

ruled
that
it
would
be
an

boundary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

so
that
--
what
about
--
justice
william

what
about
a

justice
william
j.

that's

no,
well,
i
