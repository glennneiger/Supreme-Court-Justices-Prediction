mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
although
this
case
appears
on
the
docket
as
united
states
versus
louisiana,
it
in
fact
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
louisiana.
the
dispute
here
is
as
between
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
texas.
the
legal
principle
involve
cannot
conceivably
affect
any
other
state
but
texas
with
the
single
exception
of
florida.
it
could
not
and
does
not
as
we
view
it
at
least
affect
louisiana
or
any
other
state.
nevertheless,
perhaps
in
thought
because
of
the
title,
perhaps
also
in
part
because
of
the
response
filed
by
the
state
of
texas,
louisiana
has
expressed
its
concern
that
the
court
might
think
otherwise
than
we
do
as
to
the
breadth
of
the
ruling
in
this
case,
and
have
asked
for
an
opportunity
to
briefly
state
their
views.
in
a
spirit
of
accommodation,
i
have
agreed
to
cede
few
moments
of
my
time
to
louisiana
so
that
it
may
present
that
view.
as
i
understand
it,
their
view
simply
is
that
the
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
them.
after
i
conclude,
i
will
therefore
cede
to
mr.
sachse,
special
assistant
attorney
general
of
louisiana
who
will
say
a
few
words
in
behalf
of
their
state.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
so
far
as
we
understand
their
position.
we
are
in
agreement
that
the
case
is
not
bear
on
the
question
of
how
to
delineate
their
(inaudible).
the
issue
in
this
case
is
on
this
motion
--
in
this
case
is
whether
in
delineating
the
nine-mine
--
nine-mile
belt
which
was
granted
to
texas
by
the
submerged
lands
act
as
construed
by
this
court
several
terms
ago
whether
in
measuring
that
belt,
one
begins
measuring
out
from
artificial
harbor-works
which
project
into
the
gulf
or
rather
whether
as
we
contend,
you
begin
measuring
out
that
belt
from
the
natural
shoreline.
now
the
question
is
here
because
as
it
happens,
they're
all
rather
long
jetties
that
galveston
and
sabine
pass
projecting
into
the
gulf
some
two
or
three
miles
and
some
distance
into
the
gulf
from
those
jetties
all
valuable
oil
lands.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
assuming
mr.
justice
brennan
that
the
1845
shoreline
is
very
much
like
the
present
shoreline,
the
difference
between
measuring
out
from
the
shoreline
and
measuring
out
from
the
jetties,
the
ends
of
the
jetties
as
would
be
the
rule
under
the
california
case
is
some
two
to
three
miles
an
arc
of
that
diameter,
i've
got
the
right
geometry,
that
much
more
into
the
gulf
in
the
shape
of
an
arc.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
not
entirely
clear
because
that
part
of
the
coast
was
not
fully
mapped
in
1845.
however,
we
do
have
maps
dating
from
some
years
thereafter.
i
would
hope
as
i
will
say
in
conclusion
that
should
the
court
sustain
our
first
position
which
is
that
he
must
go
--
he
must
measure
out
from
that
1845
shoreline
as
it
then
existed.
but
nevertheless,
it
may
well
turn
out
that
as
a
matter
of
administrative
compromise
because
there
had
been
both
accretion
and
erosion,
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
texas
might
amicably
agree
to
stipulate
that
the
present
shoreline
is
the
shoreline
as
of
1845.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
could
be
determined
with
some
approximation
based
on
these
later
maps
but
still
there
would
be
some
problems
if
the
parties
could
not
stipulate.
i
would
have
every
hope
that
the
parties
could
even
stipulate
what
the
1845
shoreline
was
or
stipulate
the
present
shoreline
is
as
a
practical
matter
sufficiently
close
to
that
old
shoreline.
there
has
been
relatively
little
accretion
or
erosion
on
the
texas
coast.
now,
i
do
not
mean
to
imply
by
saying
this
that
we
have
explored
with
texas
what
agreement
they
would
or
would
not
be
willing
to
enter
into
should
the
decision
go
as
we
would
urge.
i
should
add
even
now
that
we
do
have
an
alternative
argument
which
is
that
if
the
shoreline
isn't
fixed
on
the
ground
as
it
was
in
1849
--
1845,
the
boundary
might
be
viewed
as
an
ambulatory
one
which
would
now
include
the
present
shoreline
but
not
artificial
harbor-works
to
take
in
into
the
gulf.
in
that
instance
of
course,
there's
no
problem
about
fixing
the
boundaries.
no
problem
about
simply
discounting
the
projections
of
the
jetties.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
oh,
of
course
mr.
justice
harlan.
we
simply
--
when
we
speak
of
the
nine-mile
or
three-league
boundary,
we're
simply
referring
back
to
where
you
begin
to
measure
it
out
from
and
that's
the
only
relevance
of
the
shoreline.
we're
not
of
course
contesting
that
texas
is
entitled
to
a
nine-mile
belt,
that's
the
measurements.
now,
as
i
say,
the
question
here
arises
because
there
are
valuable
oil
lands
at
the
end
of
the
jetties
projecting
out
in
galveston
and
sabine
pass.
and
because
in
the
california
case
at
the
64
term,
this
court
determined
to
adopt
the
rule
of
the
international
convention
on
the
territorial
sea
in
the
contiguous
zone
to
the
effect
that
a
coastline
does
include
artificial
harbor-works,
permanent
artificial
harbor-works
and
that
the
territorial
sea
is
measured
from
the
ends
of
those
works.
so
that
if
the
california
decision
were
applicable
to
texas,
it
would
follow
that
its
nine-mile
belt
should
begin
from
the
ends
--
begin
to
be
measured
from
the
ends
of
those
jetties.
now,
because
this
leads
texas
to
say,
why
shouldn't
we
be
treated
like
everyone
else?
why
doesn't
the
california
decision
applied
to
us.
it
applies
to
louisiana
as
they
demonstrate
at
some
length
in
their
brief.
the
government
has
always
conceded
that
it
apply
to
louisiana
or
in
california
and
while
the
government
had
conceded
in
that,
this
court
so
held
in
the
california
case.
now
the
answer
why
texas
is
to
be
treated
differently
in
this
sense
in
our
view
is
that
texas,
unlike
every
other
state
except
florida
has
a
belt
which
is
determined
by
history
not
by
the
arbitrary
three-mile
belt
that
was
granted
under
the
submerged
lands
act.
the
submerged
lands
act
as
the
court
will
remember
gave
every
coastal
state
a
three-mile
belt
of
submerged
lands,
measured
out
from
its
present
coastline.
and
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
california
case
as
i've
said,
present
coastline
would
include
permanent
harbor-works.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
they're
not
curved
breakwaters
they're
rather
straight
perpendiculars,
two
of
them
from
galveston
harbor,
two
of
them
at
the
entrance
to
sabine
pass.
i
think
the
rule
would
be
under
the
california
case
to
draw
a
straight
line
across
the
ends
of
the
two
jetties
and
view
everything
within
it
as
inland
water
and
therefore
view
that
as
the
beginning
point,
the
baseline,
the
coastline
from
which
to
measure
the
three-mile
belt
if
we
were
talking
about
a
three-mile
belt
as
we
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exhibit
b
of
course
mr.
justice
stewart
is
off
the
louisiana
coast.
it's
just
an
illustration
of
the
fact
that
we
have
conceded
that
in
louisiana
you
use
this
way
of
drawing
the
coastline.
exhibit
c
does
apply
to
the
jetties
that
--
galveston
which
is
one
of
the
principle
ones
involved
in
this
case.
i
may
say
that
while
this
case
arises
because
of
the
jetty
and
the
oil
off
the
jetties
that
galveston
and
sabine,
the
decree
we
asked
for
would
apply
to
any
harbor-work
projection
into
the
gulf
off
the
coast
of
texas.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
if
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
as
i
understand
it,
that
is
correct.
now,
perhaps
i
do
have
some
large
maps
which
illustrate
in
detail
how
this
would
work
outside
of
galveston
and
outside
of
sabine
or
perhaps
if
i
left
them
with
the
clerk
they
would
help
your
honor
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
a
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
your
honor
is
correct.
i
don't
think
it's
--
i
really
misstated
when
i
said
that
the
effect
of
the
jetties
was
to
create
an
inland
body
of
water
which
would
--
from
which
it
would
be
measured
out.
it's
rather
viewed
as
a
part
of
the
land
as
it
were
and
the
closing
line
if
it
doesn't
exceed
24
miles
i
suppose
would
be
a
straight
line
across
what
is
viewed
the
two
headlands.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
it
so
happens
mr.
justice
brennan,
this
problem
could
not
arise
anywhere
else.
it
arises
only
when
you
get
more
than
three
miles
and
you
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
not
because
this
is
a
gulf
rather
than
the
open
ocean,
no
sir.
but
as
i
say,
it
happens
for
other
reasons
that
this
problem
can
only
arise
in
the
gulf
because
only
in
the
gulf
could
a
state
take
more
than
the
arbitrary
three-mile
grant
measured
from
present
coastlines
which
is
given
to
every
coastal
state
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
submerged
lands
act
first
granted
each
of
the
states
three
--
a
three-mile
belt
measured
out
from
their
present
coastline.
that's
through
the
states
on
the
atlantic,
on
the
pacific
and
in
the
gulf.
the
submerged
lands
act
--
that
claim
is
available
to
texas
like
to
every
other
state
and
it
doesn't
--
texas
is
still
free
to
make
a
claim
under
that
provision
of
the
act.
and
perhaps
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
refer
to
the
act
itself
which
is
--
relevant
portions
of
which
are
reprinted
on
pages
25
through
27
of
our
brief.
now
this
first
grant,
the
three-mile
grant
is
perhaps
--
well,
it's
specified
twice.
on
page
26,
section
3
is
the
actual
granting
provision
that
if
you
read
it,
it
will
tell
you
nothing
about
how
much
is
granted.
it
simply
says,
what
is
granted
is
the
lands
between
navigable
waters
to
the
boundary
of
the
state.
so
we
have
to
turn
back
to
section
2
to
find
out
what
those
terms
mean.
in
section
--
we're
now
on
page
25.
section
2(a)(2)
provides
that
lands
under
navigable
waters
means
first,
lands
and
i
skip
to
the
third
line,
seaward
to
align
three
geographical
miles
distant
from
the
coastline
of
each
such
state.
that's
the
first
grant
that
applies
to
each
state.
now,
the
same
idea
will
be
found
in
section
4
on
pages
26
and
27.
it
said
there
that
each
of
the
original
states
has
a
three-mile
boundary
from
its
present
coastline
and
that
any
subsequently
admitted
state
may
extend
its
boundary
two
to
three
miles
from
its
present
coastline
and
it
may
do
so
at
anytime.
so
the
practical
effect
of
this
is
that
each
state
got
a
three-mile
belt
measured
out
from
its
present
coastline.
and
as
i
say,
that's
available
to
texas
but
that
is
not
what
texas
chose
to
claim.
texas
claims
rather
under
the
second
part
of
section
2(a)(2)
on
page
25.
after
the
part
i
just
read,
it
says
that
submerged
--
lands
between
--
beneath
navigable
waters
also
means
lands
--
seaward
three
miles
from
the
coast
and
to
such
boundary
line
of
each
such
states
where
in
any
case,
such
boundary
as
it
existed
at
the
time
such
state
became
a
member
of
the
union
or
is
here
to
--
before
approved
by
congress
extends
seaward
beyond
three
geographical
miles.
so
texas
is
making
this
claim
for
something
over
the
normal
three
miles.
in
section
4
incidentally,
we
find
out
or
rather
in
section
(a)
--
section
2(a)(b),
we
found
out
that
this
claim
for
anything
over
three
miles
applies
only
to
the
gulf
states
and
not
to
the
other
states.
texas
in
other
words
claims
to
its
historic
boundary.
there
are
two
types
of
historic
boundaries.
one
is
the
boundary
of
the
state
when
it
came
to
the
union,
the
other
is
a
boundary
subsequently
approved
by
congress.
florida
was
in
the
second
case,
texas
is
in
the
first.
it
claims
the
boundary
that
it
had
at
the
time
it
entered
the
union.
now
the
act
says
nothing
about
how
you
measure
that
boundary,
how
you
determine
that
boundary
as
it
existed
when
you
came
into
the
union.
it
doesn't
say
that
you
measure
it
out
from
the
coastline,
it
doesn't
say
of
course
how
wide
it
is
and
there's
a
good
reason
for
this
that
historic
boundary
may
not
have
been
related
to
the
coast
at
all.
it
may
not
have
been
x
miles
from
the
coast.
it
might
have
been
a
fixed
line.
louisiana
at
one
time
claimed
a
line
of
boundary
on
the
27th
parallel
that
was
not
parallel
to
the
coast
or
not
exactly
parallel
to
the
coast.
it
might
have
been
a
line
made
up
of
straight
lines
between
reefs
that
were
not
even
distance
from
the
coast
at
all
points.
or
finally,
it
might
have
been
a
boundary
that
is
defined
in
terms
of
so
many
miles
from
the
high
water
mark
rather
than
the
low
water
mark
which
is
what
coastline
means
in
the
submerged
lands
act.
because
of
all
these
possibilities,
quite
naturally,
the
act
did
not
say
where
a
historic
boundary
is
measured
out
from.
what
the
act
in
effect
says
that
whenever
you
have
a
historic
boundary,
whenever
you
can
establish
a
historic
boundary
that
is
somewhere
between
three
and
nine
miles
from
the
present
coast,
you're
entitled
to
all
the
land
--
all
the
submerged
land
enclosed
within
it.
i
say
not
exceeding
nine
miles
because
the
act
puts
an
outer
limit,
a
maximum
of
nine
miles
from
the
present
coast
as
the
most
that
any
states
even
a
gulf
state
could
get.
the
effect
of
this
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
maximum
nine-mile
limit
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
including
artificial
structures.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
part
of
it
is
like
the
california
case.
exactly
your
honor.
but
that's
the
maximum
and
the
minimum
as
it
were
that
three
miles
is
measured
also
from
the
same
modern
coastline
which
includes
artificial
harbor-works
but
the
historic
boundary
is
wherever
it
was
and
it
may
not
be
as
i
say
even
an
equal
distance
from
the
shore
at
any
given
point.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly.
now,
the
net
result
of
these
grants
by
the
submerged
lands
act
is
that
any
state
which
had
a
historic
boundary
that
was
more
than
nine
miles
from
its
present
coast
would
get
nine
miles
from
its
present
coast
including
harbor-works.
any
state
that
had
a
historic
boundary
of
less
than
three
miles
from
its
present
coast
could
now
claim
three
miles
from
its
present
coast.
any
state
and
we
say
texas
is
in
this
last
category,
it
had
a
historic
boundary
somewhere
in
between
three
and
nine
miles
from
its
present
coast,
gets
that
much
and
no
more.
now,
because
all
the
gulf
states
made
claims
to
boundaries
beyond
the
three-mile
grant
that
everyone
else
received,
trying
to
set
up
historic
boundaries
but
only
two
of
them
prevailed.
they
were
texas
and
florida.
it
so
happens
and
i
think
this
is
the
source
of
the
confusion
that
texas'
historic
boundary
is
a
nine-mile
three-league
boundary
measured
more
or
less
from
the
shore.
the
question
is
whether
that
nine-mile
belt
which
is
a
matter
of
history
was
the
texas
boundary
is
coextensive
with
the
nine-mile
maximum
which
would
be
measured
from
the
present
coastline.
we
say
it
is
not.
but
in
any
event,
the
question
whether
those
two
boundaries
are
coextensive
cannot
be
resolved
by
looking
to
the
submerged
lands
act.
that
question
has
to
be
resolved
by
looking
to
the
historical
documents
which
determine
where
the
old
boundary
was.
the
submerged
lands
act
is
not
going
to
tell
us
that.
all
the
submerged
lands
act
says
is
that
texas
or
any
state
in
this
comparable
position
may
take
to
its
old
boundary
as
it
existed
at
the
time
it
came
into
the
union.
now
in
the
case
of
texas,
the
historic
document
that
is
relevant
to
fixing
the
historic
boundary
is
as
this
court
found
in
the
case
entitled
united
states
versus
louisiana
or
in
texas
etcetera
is
the
texas
boundary
act,
the
boundary
act
of
1836
which
was
passed
by
the
republic
of
texas
and
which
was
deemed
to
have
been
accepted
by
the
united
states
when
texas
was
admitted
to
the
union
in
1845.
and
it
is
to
that
document
that
we
must
look
to
determine
where
the
texas
boundary
was
and
whether
it
was
nine
miles
from
the
present
coastline
which
on
its
face
seems
unlikely
if
there's
been
any
change
in
the
coastline
or
rather
whether
it
was
nine
miles
from
some
other
baseline.
now
at
this
point,
texas
really
abandons
the
debate.
none
of
their
brief
is
addressed
to
the
question
what
nine
miles
from
land
means
in
the
boundary
act
of
1836.
texas'
entire
position
here
is
that
the
submerged
lands
act
tells
us
where
the
texas'
historic
boundary
was.
if
we
are
right
that
the
submerged
lands
act
does
not
resolve
this
question,
i
take
it
and
i
maybe
corrected
that
texas
has
no
further
argument
to
present.
and
that's
not
surprising
because
if
one
accepts
our
position
that
the
1836
act
fixes
the
old
historic
boundary
of
texas,
it's
perfectly
plain
that
that
boundary
had
no
relation
to
the
present
coastline
but
have
relation
rather
to
the
coastline
as
it
existed
at
that
time
or
a
few
years
later
in
1845
when
the
state
was
admitted
to
the
union.
now
as
i've
said,
the
texas
boundary
act
sets
a
boundary
for
texas
in
the
gulf
three
leagues
from
land.
three
leagues
being
the
first
nine
miles.
now
we
assume
that
land
in
that
context
means
below
water
mark
along
the
shoreline
rather
than
the
high
water
mark
or
some
intermediate
point.
in
that
respect,
we
accept
the
notion
that
the
waterline
involved
is
the
same
kind
of
waterline
that
is
spoken
of
in
the
submerged
lands
act.
but
there
are
at
least
three
reasons
why
harbor-works
cannot
have
been
included
in
this
nine-mile
belt
that
texas
had
as
a
matter
of
history.
the
first
and
really
dispositive
reason
is
that
these
harbor-works
did
not
exist
in
1845.
indeed,
there
were
no
harbor-works
thus
stipulated.
there
were
no
harbor-works
projecting
from
the
texas
coast
in
1845
when
that
state
was
admitted
in
the
union.
furthermore,
the
international
practice
of
fixing
international
boundaries
in
the
sense
of
territorial
sea
from
artificial
harbor-works
is
a
practice
that
developed
very
much
later
and
was
not
current
in
1845
and
because
it's
wholly
unlikely
that
texas
having
no
harbor-works
of
its
own
would
have
devised
a
new
and
radical
way
of
defining
its
own
boundary
contrary
to
the
then
international
practice.
finally
and
i've
even
stressed
this,
land,
the
word
used
by
the
texas
boundary
act,
tends
to
connote
not
artificial
structures
added
but
rather
the
natural
shoreline.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
harlan,
our
first
position
is
that
it
does
not.
it
would
extend
the
boundary
but
that
was
because
water
boundaries
as
then
as
now
all
viewed
as
ambulatory
to
the
extent
that
natural
and
perceptible
accretion
or
erosion
occurs.
that
simply
a
principle
of
water
boundary
law
as
i
understand
it
which
was
fully
recognized
at
that
debate.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
submerged
lands
act
is
viewed
as
confirming
the
texas
historic
boundary
as
it
would
exist
today,
we
would
have
to
concede
that
any
accretions
or
erosions
by
natural
forces
should
be
taken
into
account.
it
doesn't
seem
to
us
however
that
that's
really
what
the
submerged
lands
act
has
in
mind.
it
seems
to
us
rather
that
when
the
act
speaks
of
the
boundary
as
it
existed
at
the
time
of
admission,
it
means
as
it
was
then
located
and
as
i've
pointed
out
that
it
could
present
problems
of
retracing
the
boundary
but
i
think
those
problems
could
be
worked
out.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
i
--
but
i
--
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
it's
indisputable
that
the
boundary
of
texas
as
fixed
by
the
1836
act
did
shift
and
had
it
ever
been
recognized
by
the
united
states
or
by
the
courts
would
have
shifted
in
all
this
time
and
certainly
shifted
between
1836
and
1845.
the
only
reason
for
not
taking
shifts
after
1845
into
account
is
that
the
submerged
lands
act
seems
to
throw
us
back
to
that
date
and
to
say
we
will
reconstruct
things
as
they
were
then.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that's
our
first
premise
but
we
do
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
--
we
concede
that
it
would
be
a
quite
reasonable
reading
rather
to
think
of
it
as
endorsing
the
principle
--
endorsing
not
the
principle,
the
boundary
with
all
its
subsequent
shifts
in
either
direction
which
is
it
--
turns
out
in
the
case
of
texas
may
very
well
cancel
each
other
out.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
section
2(a)(2)
mr.
justice
white
on
page
25
of
our
brief
about
the
middle
of
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
and
to
the
boundary
of
each
such
state
that
identical
language
is
reproduced
in
section
4.
and
in
both
instances
with
respect
to
boundary
at
the
time
of
admission,
the
words
are
as
it
existed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that
is
our
ultimate
conclusion
but
i
want
to
hasten
to
add
mr.
justice
fortas
that
it
applies
to
texas.
insofar
as
texas
claims
three
miles
which
it
could
do
in
--
where
there
was
a
tremendous
accretion,
it's
conceivable
that
the
three-mile
grant
from
the
present
coastline
would
be
more
beneficial
than
the
nine-mile
grant
from
an
old
shoreline.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
fortas
because
all
the
court
did
in
united
states
versus
california
was
construe
a
present
grant
from
present
coastlines.
and
in
order
to
determine
how
a
present
coastline
was
to
be
located,
the
court
found
it
useful
to
refer,
to
adopt
the
rules
of
the
international
convention
then
recently
ratified
by
the
united
states
which
are
at
least
harbor-works
is
part
of
the
coastline.
there
were
two
considerations
present
in
the
california
case
which
are
not
present
here.
the
first
was
the
court
was
concerned
that
the
international
boundary
and
the
state
boundary
so
far
as
possible
be
one
and
the
same.
since
the
united
states
for
international
purposes
that
adopted
the
rule
of
the
convention
which
included
harbor-works
are
--
it
was
proper
to
do
the
same
with
respect
to
the
state
boundary.
but
that
consideration
does
not
apply
here
of
course
because
here
we're
dealing
with
a
boundary
that's
nine
miles
out
which
in
no
event
can
be
coextensive
with
the
international
boundary
which
is
only
three
miles
out.
so
that
consideration
of
co-extensiveness
simply
doesn't
weigh
here.
but
more
important
perhaps
in
the
california
case,
the
court
was
construing
a
new
grant
of
three
miles
from
present
coastlines
and
was
taking
the
modern
view
as
to
what
a
coastline
was.
here
on
the
contrary,
the
court
is
asked
to
construe
a
grant
to
--
on
historic
boundary
which
has
no
necessary
relation
to
any
coastline
much
to
as
to
a
modern
coastline.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
first
mr.
justice
fortas
turning
to
page
25,
section
2(a)(2).
we
get
all
lands
and
now
i
skip
permanently
title
lands
that
are
not
involved
here.
all
lands
seaward
--
skipping
to
the
third
line.
all
lands
seaward
to
a
line
three
geographical
miles
distant
from
the
coastline
of
each
such
state.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
court
so
held
and
we
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
now,
and
further,
and
to
the
boundary
line
of
each
such
state
where
in
any
case
such
boundary
as
it
existed
at
the
time
such
state
became
a
member
of
the
union
or
is
here
before
approved
by
the
congress.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
frankly
don't
see
any
other
way
to
read
it
mr.--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
frankly
don't
see
any
other
way
to
read
it
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
appreciate
it.
that
may
be
their
argument.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'd
--
i
agree
with
that.
i
would
draw
your
honors
attention
also
to
section
4,
pages
26
and
27,
leaving
aside
the
first
sentence
which
is
again
referring
to
the
three-mile
arbitrary
grant,
three
geographical
miles
distant
from
its
coastline,
meaning
its
present
coastline
as
construed
by
this
court
in
the
california
case.
now
it
--no
reference
to
coastline
any
longer
when
we
are
talking
about
the
further
grant
in
the
last
sentence
on
page
27
which
reserves
the
question
of
historic
boundaries.
we
have
nothing
in
this
section
as
to
be
construed
as
prejudicing
and
so
forth.
the
existence
of
any
state
seaward
boundary
beyond
three
geographical
miles
if
it
was
so
provided
by
its
constitutional
laws
prior
to
at
the
time
of
such
state
became
a
member
of
the
union.
again,
we're
thrown
back,
you
get
three
miles,
you
get
so
much
more
as
you
had
at
the
time
of
admission.
and
how
one
could
determine
what
you
had
at
the
time
of
admission
by
reference
to
harbor-works
which
were
constructed
50
years
later
is
difficult
to
grasp.
now
let
me
say
finally
that
our
submission
doesn't
seem
to
us
in
anyway
unfair
to
texas.
i've
already
mentioned
in
passing
that
texas
may
at
any
time
he
chooses
take
full
advantage
of
the
three-mile
grant
which
every
state
received.
there
are
some
suggestion
in
the
brief
that
a
nine-mile
limit
computed
the
way
we
compute
it
might
end
up
by
denying
the
state
any
present
marginal
sea
whatever.
that
is
not
true
because
when
you
come
to
that
point
when
there's
that
much
accretion
then
you
may
switch
to
the
three-mile
grant.
and
you
can
combine
the
two
and
you
can
change
your
mind
at
any
time.
texas
has
no
need
to
opt
nor
does
it
have
to
--
have
the
same
--
head
of
the
grant
for
each
portion
of
its
coast.
in
some,
the
rule
we
urge
applies
to
texas
and
it
applies
to
every
other
state
in
the
same
situation
so
happens
that
there
was
only
one
other
state,
florida
which
prevailed
it
having
a
boundary
beyond
three
miles.
that's
the
only
reason
this
seems
like
a
rule
specially
fashioned
for
texas
in
fact
it
is
not.
and
in
reverse,
the
rule
of
the
california
case
applies
to
every
state
including
texas
with
respect
to
the
three-mile
grant.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
florida
was
of
course
served
by
us
as
a
party
to
this
litigation
and
i
had
rather
anticipated
that
florida
might
be
here
speaking
since
it
has
a
possible
interest
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
frankly
don't
know
mr.
justice
harlan
whether
there
are
any
jetties
so
--
which
would
be
involved
in
florida.
perhaps
not
and
perhaps
that's
why
they're
disinterested
or
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
that
is
so
--
no.
i
should
add
that
there
is
one
--
the
rule
that
you
look
to
the
historic
document
rather
than
to
the
submerged
lands
act
to
determine
where
you
start
measuring
the
historic
belt
of
course
applies
to
florida
as
it
does
here.
the
historic
documents
in
the
case
of
florida
would
of
course
be
their
own
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
take
it
though
that
they
have
had
a
full
notice
and
opportunity
to
appear.
we
have
no
present
dispute
with
florida
that
turns
on
the
question
presented
here
or
perhaps
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
could
advice
the
court
more
firmly
that
we
anticipate
no
such
problem
with
florida
with
respect
to
this
question
of
harbor-works.
there
may
be
other
questions
that
turn
on
this
principle
in
the
broader
sense.
there
are
decisions,
the
decree
in
this
case
or
the
decree
of
the
florida
case
speaks
of
three-leagues
from
coastline
then
adopts
the
definition
of
the
submerged
lands
act
without
i
suppose
meaning
to
resolve
the
question
we
have
here
today.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
but
there
may
be
in
that
some
questions
with
florida
as
well.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
not
clear
about
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
so
happens
that
the
particular
harbor-works
that
we
are
focusing
on,
the
galveston
and
sabine
were
in
existence
in
1953.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
--
as
i
remember,
that's
the
--
that
was
a
--
well,
in
the
california
case,
i
think
we
argued
for
a
coastline
as
of
1953
rather
than
offer
the
rules
applicable
to
coastline
as
1953
rather
than
the
later
rules.
i
should
suppose
that
we
would
concede
that
one
could
include
not
only
this
but
any
future
harbor-works
if
the
rule
is
not
1845
but
1953
--
if
it's
not
1845
then
it's
open-ended
i
think.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
oh,
as
for
the
future,
yes
that
is
possible.
i
will
now
cede
a
few
minutes
to
mr.
sachse
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
louisiana
and
reserve
what
time
remains
for
rebuttal
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
a
word
about
louisiana,
perhaps
i've
been
too
accommodating.
i'm
taken
by
surprise
by
the
suggestion
louisiana
makes
that
in
no
event
should
this
case
be
decided
until
the
arguments
with
respect
to
the
louisiana
coastlines
are
to
be
settled
and
that
case
conceivably
may
require
reference
to
a
master
and
therefore
delay
the
resolution
of
this
one
for
a
very
long
time
if
that
suggestion
were
adopted.
i
had
thought
louisiana
agreed
with
us
that
this
case
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
louisiana
or
with
the
louisiana
coastline
but
the
principle
involved
here
cannot
under
--
in
any
way
affect
louisiana,
though
it
can
affect
florida.
as
to
florida,
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
florida
perhaps
should
be
here.
i,
on
the
other
hand,
feel
that
perhaps
that's
their
responsibility.
they
had
been
said
with
all
papers
in
this
case
from
the
very
beginning
had
chosen
not
to
appear
because
they
appear
not
to
be
concerned,
and
i
don't
know
that
this
rather
pressing
dispute
should
be
delayed
on
that
account.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
sure
they
do,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
know
that
we
made
a
special
point
of
--
we
served
all
the
states
but
we
were
careful
of
knowing
that
florida
could
be
concerned
to
assert
them.
i
remind
the
court
that
this
proceeding
began
by
an
ex
parte
restraining
order
issued
on
one
day's
notice
by
this
court.
it
involves
valuable
islands
which
neither
side
is
drilling
at
the
moment
under
an
agreement
not
to
do
so.
and
unlike
the
louisiana
case
where
there's
a
working
agreement
which
permits
drilling
in
the
interim,
here
there
is
none
and
here
i
speak
perhaps
more
on
behalf
of
texas
than
on
behalf
of
united
states.
texas
has
voluntarily
withheld
any
action
in
this
area
and
i
don't
know
that
they
should
be
required
to
do
so
indefinitely
simply
because
louisiana
has
what
i
concede
to
be
unjustified
fears
if
this
court's
going
astray
in
its
decision
here.
one
word
about
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
this
question
here,
mr.
justice
black
of
--
the
ruling
here
should
we
prevail
will
govern
the
florida
coastline,
whether
that's
of
any
impractical
importance
or
not
i
don't
know
but
they
will
be
affected
in
theory
by
the
ruling
here,
whether
in
practice
--
it
makes
any
difference
whether
there's
any
oil
involved
or
any
reason
of
care,
i
don't
know.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
on
the
contrary,
mr.
justice
black,
i
am
suggesting
that
florida
had
ample
notice
and
opportunity
to
appear
here
if
it
thought
itself
importantly
affected
by
the
ruling
that
would
be
made
in
this
case.
it
shows
not
to
appear
here,
i
(inaudible)
--
i
had
no
reason
to
say
that
that
wasn't
informed
and
intelligent
choice
on
its
part.
and
therefore,
i
would
not
suggest
that
the
court
should
re-invite
florida
which
of
course
was
always
a
party.
there's
no
question
of
its
obtaining
leave
to
file.
it
could've
simply
responded
as
texas
did.
at
least,
it's
my
understanding
of
the
nature
of
this
original
case.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
am
so.
one,
word
about
the
argument
made
by
the
attorney
general
of
texas,
most
of
that
argument,
if
i
understood
it
correctly,
was
about
whether
our
first
argument
or
whether
our
second
argument
ought
to
prevail
whether
this
is
an
ambulatory
boundary
or
whether
it's
fixed
as
of
1845.
that
is
the
point
and
the
only
point
to
which
mr.
shalowitz's
treaties
addresses
itself.
he
favors
the
second
argument
we
make,
the
common
law
rule
that
would
have
an
ambulatory
boundary,
but
not
a
changing
boundary.
to
include
harbor-works,
you'd
have
to
have
a
change
in
the
boundary.
only
natural
accretion
would
be
included
within
the
ambulatory
maritime
boundary.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
will
do
so,
mr.
justice.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
if
the
court
should
hold
that
the
california
principle
applies
to
texas,
then
of
course
we
would
concede
that
new
harbor-works
would
move
the
boundary
out
and
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
for
purposes
of
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
of
this
act.
and
incidentally
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
oh,
we
have
taken
the
contrary
position
but
now
--
the
court
having
ruled
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
as
insofar
as
changes
of
fact,
not
insofar
as
changes
of
law.
if
the
united
states
should
have
a
new
international
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
should
it
adhere
to
a
new
convention
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
a
new
harbor-work
i
take
it
would
clearly
throw
out
the
boundary
by
that
much.
and
incidentally,
extensions
do
not
--
are
not
limited
to
reasonable
extensions.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct,
but
there
was
an
answer
that
only
reasonable
extensions
of
these
jetties
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
would
extend
the
boundary
under
a
california
case
were
it
applicable
here
by
that
much.
the
rule
of
that
reasonable
extensions
applies
only
to
things
which
are
assimilated
to
harbor-works
but
which
are
not
full-fledged
harbor-works.
these
are
conceded
to
be
full-fledged
harbor-works.
one
last
thing
i'd
like
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
is
the
legislative
history
here
on
pages
13
and
14
of
our
brief,
which
make
it
very
clear
that
the
congress
had
in
mind
that
--
with
respect
to
the
three-mile
boundary,
you
had
to
start
from
the
modern
coastlines.
senator
long
suggesting
to
the
contrary
was
rebuffed.
on
the
other
hand,
the
senator
who
persuaded
him
to
withdraw
his
suggestion
admitted
that
when
you
went
beyond
the
three
miles,
then
louisiana
as
any
other
state
would
look
to
its
historic
boundary.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
although
this
case
appears
on
the
docket
as
united
states
versus
louisiana,
it
in
fact
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
louisiana.
the
dispute
here
is
as
between
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
texas.
the
legal
principle
involve
cannot
conceivably
affect
any
other
state
but
texas
with
the
single
exception
of
florida.
it
could
not
and
does
not
as
we
view
it
at
least
affect
louisiana
or
any
other
state.
nevertheless,
perhaps
in
thought
because
of
the
title,
perhaps
also
in
part
because
of
the
response
filed
by
the
state
of
texas,
louisiana
has
expressed
its
concern
that
the
court
might
think
otherwise
than
we
do
as
to
the
breadth
of
the
ruling
in
this
case,
and
have
asked
for
an
opportunity
to
briefly
state
their
views.
in
a
spirit
of
accommodation,
i
have
agreed
to
cede
few
moments
of
my
time
to
louisiana
so
that
it
may
present
that
view.
as
i
understand
it,
their
view
simply
is
that
the
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
them.
after
i
conclude,
i
will
therefore
cede
to
mr.
sachse,
special
assistant
attorney
general
of
louisiana
who
will
say
a
few
words
in
behalf
of
their
state.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
so
far
as
we
understand
their
position.
we
are
in
agreement
that
the
case
is
not
bear
on
the
question
of
how
to
delineate
their
(inaudible).
the
issue
in
this
case
is
on
this
motion
--
in
this
case
is
whether
in
delineating
the
nine-mine
--
nine-mile
belt
which
was
granted
to
texas
by
the
submerged
lands
act
as
construed
by
this
court
several
terms
ago
whether
in
measuring
that
belt,
one
begins
measuring
out
from
artificial
harbor-works
which
project
into
the
gulf
or
rather
whether
as
we
contend,
you
begin
measuring
out
that
belt
from
the
natural
shoreline.
now
the
question
is
here
because
as
it
happens,
they're
all
rather
long
jetties
that
galveston
and
sabine
pass
projecting
into
the
gulf
some
two
or
three
miles
and
some
distance
into
the
gulf
from
those
jetties
all
valuable
oil
lands.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
assuming
mr.
justice
brennan
that
the
1845
shoreline
is
very
much
like
the
present
shoreline,
the
difference
between
measuring
out
from
the
shoreline
and
measuring
out
from
the
jetties,
the
ends
of
the
jetties
as
would
be
the
rule
under
the
california
case
is
some
two
to
three
miles
an
arc
of
that
diameter,
i've
got
the
right
geometry,
that
much
more
into
the
gulf
in
the
shape
of
an
arc.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
not
entirely
clear
because
that
part
of
the
coast
was
not
fully
mapped
in
1845.
however,
we
do
have
maps
dating
from
some
years
thereafter.
i
would
hope
as
i
will
say
in
conclusion
that
should
the
court
sustain
our
first
position
which
is
that
he
must
go
--
he
must
measure
out
from
that
1845
shoreline
as
it
then
existed.
but
nevertheless,
it
may
well
turn
out
that
as
a
matter
of
administrative
compromise
because
there
had
been
both
accretion
and
erosion,
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
texas
might
amicably
agree
to
stipulate
that
the
present
shoreline
is
the
shoreline
as
of
1845.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
could
be
determined
with
some
approximation
based
on
these
later
maps
but
still
there
would
be
some
problems
if
the
parties
could
not
stipulate.
i
would
have
every
hope
that
the
parties
could
even
stipulate
what
the
1845
shoreline
was
or
stipulate
the
present
shoreline
is
as
a
practical
matter
sufficiently
close
to
that
old
shoreline.
there
has
been
relatively
little
accretion
or
erosion
on
the
texas
coast.
now,
i
do
not
mean
to
imply
by
saying
this
that
we
have
explored
with
texas
what
agreement
they
would
or
would
not
be
willing
to
enter
into
should
the
decision
go
as
we
would
urge.
i
should
add
even
now
that
we
do
have
an
alternative
argument
which
is
that
if
the
shoreline
isn't
fixed
on
the
ground
as
it
was
in
1849
--
1845,
the
boundary
might
be
viewed
as
an
ambulatory
one
which
would
now
include
the
present
shoreline
but
not
artificial
harbor-works
to
take
in
into
the
gulf.
in
that
instance
of
course,
there's
no
problem
about
fixing
the
boundaries.
no
problem
about
simply
discounting
the
projections
of
the
jetties.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
oh,
of
course
mr.
justice
harlan.
we
simply
--
when
we
speak
of
the
nine-mile
or
three-league
boundary,
we're
simply
referring
back
to
where
you
begin
to
measure
it
out
from
and
that's
the
only
relevance
of
the
shoreline.
we're
not
of
course
contesting
that
texas
is
entitled
to
a
nine-mile
belt,
that's
the
measurements.
now,
as
i
say,
the
question
here
arises
because
there
are
valuable
oil
lands
at
the
end
of
the
jetties
projecting
out
in
galveston
and
sabine
pass.
and
because
in
the
california
case
at
the
64
term,
this
court
determined
to
adopt
the
rule
of
the
international
convention
on
the
territorial
sea
in
the
contiguous
zone
to
the
effect
that
a
coastline
does
include
artificial
harbor-works,
permanent
artificial
harbor-works
and
that
the
territorial
sea
is
measured
from
the
ends
of
those
works.
so
that
if
the
california
decision
were
applicable
to
texas,
it
would
follow
that
its
nine-mile
belt
should
begin
from
the
ends
--
begin
to
be
measured
from
the
ends
of
those
jetties.
now,
because
this
leads
texas
to
say,
why
shouldn't
we
be
treated
like
everyone
else?
why
doesn't
the
california
decision
applied
to
us.
it
applies
to
louisiana
as
they
demonstrate
at
some
length
in
their
brief.
the
government
has
always
conceded
that
it
apply
to
louisiana
or
in
california
and
while
the
government
had
conceded
in
that,
this
court
so
held
in
the
california
case.
now
the
answer
why
texas
is
to
be
treated
differently
in
this
sense
in
our
view
is
that
texas,
unlike
every
other
state
except
florida
has
a
belt
which
is
determined
by
history
not
by
the
arbitrary
three-mile
belt
that
was
granted
under
the
submerged
lands
act.
the
submerged
lands
act
as
the
court
will
remember
gave
every
coastal
state
a
three-mile
belt
of
submerged
lands,
measured
out
from
its
present
coastline.
and
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
california
case
as
i've
said,
present
coastline
would
include
permanent
harbor-works.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
they're
not
curved
breakwaters
they're
rather
straight
perpendiculars,
two
of
them
from
galveston
harbor,
two
of
them
at
the
entrance
to
sabine
pass.
i
think
the
rule
would
be
under
the
california
case
to
draw
a
straight
line
across
the
ends
of
the
two
jetties
and
view
everything
within
it
as
inland
water
and
therefore
view
that
as
the
beginning
point,
the
baseline,
the
coastline
from
which
to
measure
the
three-mile
belt
if
we
were
talking
about
a
three-mile
belt
as
we
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exhibit
b
of
course
mr.
justice
stewart
is
off
the
louisiana
coast.
it's
just
an
illustration
of
the
fact
that
we
have
conceded
that
in
louisiana
you
use
this
way
of
drawing
the
coastline.
exhibit
c
does
apply
to
the
jetties
that
--
galveston
which
is
one
of
the
principle
ones
involved
in
this
case.
i
may
say
that
while
this
case
arises
because
of
the
jetty
and
the
oil
off
the
jetties
that
galveston
and
sabine,
the
decree
we
asked
for
would
apply
to
any
harbor-work
projection
into
the
gulf
off
the
coast
of
texas.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
if
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
as
i
understand
it,
that
is
correct.
now,
perhaps
i
do
have
some
large
maps
which
illustrate
in
detail
how
this
would
work
outside
of
galveston
and
outside
of
sabine
or
perhaps
if
i
left
them
with
the
clerk
they
would
help
your
honor
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
a
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
your
honor
is
correct.
i
don't
think
it's
--
i
really
misstated
when
i
said
that
the
effect
of
the
jetties
was
to
create
an
inland
body
of
water
which
would
--
from
which
it
would
be
measured
out.
it's
rather
viewed
as
a
part
of
the
land
as
it
were
and
the
closing
line
if
it
doesn't
exceed
24
miles
i
suppose
would
be
a
straight
line
across
what
is
viewed
the
two
headlands.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
it
so
happens
mr.
justice
brennan,
this
problem
could
not
arise
anywhere
else.
it
arises
only
when
you
get
more
than
three
miles
and
you
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
not
because
this
is
a
gulf
rather
than
the
open
ocean,
no
sir.
but
as
i
say,
it
happens
for
other
reasons
that
this
problem
can
only
arise
in
the
gulf
because
only
in
the
gulf
could
a
state
take
more
than
the
arbitrary
three-mile
grant
measured
from
present
coastlines
which
is
given
to
every
coastal
state
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
submerged
lands
act
first
granted
each
of
the
states
three
--
a
three-mile
belt
measured
out
from
their
present
coastline.
that's
through
the
states
on
the
atlantic,
on
the
pacific
and
in
the
gulf.
the
submerged
lands
act
--
that
claim
is
available
to
texas
like
to
every
other
state
and
it
doesn't
--
texas
is
still
free
to
make
a
claim
under
that
provision
of
the
act.
and
perhaps
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
refer
to
the
act
itself
which
is
--
relevant
portions
of
which
are
reprinted
on
pages
25
through
27
of
our
brief.
now
this
first
grant,
the
three-mile
grant
is
perhaps
--
well,
it's
specified
twice.
on
page
26,
section
3
is
the
actual
granting
provision
that
if
you
read
it,
it
will
tell
you
nothing
about
how
much
is
granted.
it
simply
says,
what
is
granted
is
the
lands
between
navigable
waters
to
the
boundary
of
the
state.
so
we
have
to
turn
back
to
section
2
to
find
out
what
those
terms
mean.
in
section
--
we're
now
on
page
25.
section
2(a)(2)
provides
that
lands
under
navigable
waters
means
first,
lands
and
i
skip
to
the
third
line,
seaward
to
align
three
geographical
miles
distant
from
the
coastline
of
each
such
state.
that's
the
first
grant
that
applies
to
each
state.
now,
the
same
idea
will
be
found
in
section
4
on
pages
26
and
27.
it
said
there
that
each
of
the
original
states
has
a
three-mile
boundary
from
its
present
coastline
and
that
any
subsequently
admitted
state
may
extend
its
boundary
two
to
three
miles
from
its
present
coastline
and
it
may
do
so
at
anytime.
so
the
practical
effect
of
this
is
that
each
state
got
a
three-mile
belt
measured
out
from
its
present
coastline.
and
as
i
say,
that's
available
to
texas
but
that
is
not
what
texas
chose
to
claim.
texas
claims
rather
under
the
second
part
of
section
2(a)(2)
on
page
25.
after
the
part
i
just
read,
it
says
that
submerged
--
lands
between
--
beneath
navigable
waters
also
means
lands
--
seaward
three
miles
from
the
coast
and
to
such
boundary
line
of
each
such
states
where
in
any
case,
such
boundary
as
it
existed
at
the
time
such
state
became
a
member
of
the
union
or
is
here
to
--
before
approved
by
congress
extends
seaward
beyond
three
geographical
miles.
so
texas
is
making
this
claim
for
something
over
the
normal
three
miles.
in
section
4
incidentally,
we
find
out
or
rather
in
section
(a)
--
section
2(a)(b),
we
found
out
that
this
claim
for
anything
over
three
miles
applies
only
to
the
gulf
states
and
not
to
the
other
states.
texas
in
other
words
claims
to
its
historic
boundary.
there
are
two
types
of
historic
boundaries.
one
is
the
boundary
of
the
state
when
it
came
to
the
union,
the
other
is
a
boundary
subsequently
approved
by
congress.
florida
was
in
the
second
case,
texas
is
in
the
first.
it
claims
the
boundary
that
it
had
at
the
time
it
entered
the
union.
now
the
act
says
nothing
about
how
you
measure
that
boundary,
how
you
determine
that
boundary
as
it
existed
when
you
came
into
the
union.
it
doesn't
say
that
you
measure
it
out
from
the
coastline,
it
doesn't
say
of
course
how
wide
it
is
and
there's
a
good
reason
for
this
that
historic
boundary
may
not
have
been
related
to
the
coast
at
all.
it
may
not
have
been
x
miles
from
the
coast.
it
might
have
been
a
fixed
line.
louisiana
at
one
time
claimed
a
line
of
boundary
on
the
27th
parallel
that
was
not
parallel
to
the
coast
or
not
exactly
parallel
to
the
coast.
it
might
have
been
a
line
made
up
of
straight
lines
between
reefs
that
were
not
even
distance
from
the
coast
at
all
points.
or
finally,
it
might
have
been
a
boundary
that
is
defined
in
terms
of
so
many
miles
from
the
high
water
mark
rather
than
the
low
water
mark
which
is
what
coastline
means
in
the
submerged
lands
act.
because
of
all
these
possibilities,
quite
naturally,
the
act
did
not
say
where
a
historic
boundary
is
measured
out
from.
what
the
act
in
effect
says
that
whenever
you
have
a
historic
boundary,
whenever
you
can
establish
a
historic
boundary
that
is
somewhere
between
three
and
nine
miles
from
the
present
coast,
you're
entitled
to
all
the
land
--
all
the
submerged
land
enclosed
within
it.
i
say
not
exceeding
nine
miles
because
the
act
puts
an
outer
limit,
a
maximum
of
nine
miles
from
the
present
coast
as
the
most
that
any
states
even
a
gulf
state
could
get.
the
effect
of
this
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
maximum
nine-mile
limit
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
including
artificial
structures.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
part
of
it
is
like
the
california
case.
exactly
your
honor.
but
that's
the
maximum
and
the
minimum
as
it
were
that
three
miles
is
measured
also
from
the
same
modern
coastline
which
includes
artificial
harbor-works
but
the
historic
boundary
is
wherever
it
was
and
it
may
not
be
as
i
say
even
an
equal
distance
from
the
shore
at
any
given
point.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly.
now,
the
net
result
of
these
grants
by
the
submerged
lands
act
is
that
any
state
which
had
a
historic
boundary
that
was
more
than
nine
miles
from
its
present
coast
would
get
nine
miles
from
its
present
coast
including
harbor-works.
any
state
that
had
a
historic
boundary
of
less
than
three
miles
from
its
present
coast
could
now
claim
three
miles
from
its
present
coast.
any
state
and
we
say
texas
is
in
this
last
category,
it
had
a
historic
boundary
somewhere
in
between
three
and
nine
miles
from
its
present
coast,
gets
that
much
and
no
more.
now,
because
all
the
gulf
states
made
claims
to
boundaries
beyond
the
three-mile
grant
that
everyone
else
received,
trying
to
set
up
historic
boundaries
but
only
two
of
them
prevailed.
they
were
texas
and
florida.
it
so
happens
and
i
think
this
is
the
source
of
the
confusion
that
texas'
historic
boundary
is
a
nine-mile
three-league
boundary
measured
more
or
less
from
the
shore.
the
question
is
whether
that
nine-mile
belt
which
is
a
matter
of
history
was
the
texas
boundary
is
coextensive
with
the
nine-mile
maximum
which
would
be
measured
from
the
present
coastline.
we
say
it
is
not.
but
in
any
event,
the
question
whether
those
two
boundaries
are
coextensive
cannot
be
resolved
by
looking
to
the
submerged
lands
act.
that
question
has
to
be
resolved
by
looking
to
the
historical
documents
which
determine
where
the
old
boundary
was.
the
submerged
lands
act
is
not
going
to
tell
us
that.
all
the
submerged
lands
act
says
is
that
texas
or
any
state
in
this
comparable
position
may
take
to
its
old
boundary
as
it
existed
at
the
time
it
came
into
the
union.
now
in
the
case
of
texas,
the
historic
document
that
is
relevant
to
fixing
the
historic
boundary
is
as
this
court
found
in
the
case
entitled
united
states
versus
louisiana
or
in
texas
etcetera
is
the
texas
boundary
act,
the
boundary
act
of
1836
which
was
passed
by
the
republic
of
texas
and
which
was
deemed
to
have
been
accepted
by
the
united
states
when
texas
was
admitted
to
the
union
in
1845.
and
it
is
to
that
document
that
we
must
look
to
determine
where
the
texas
boundary
was
and
whether
it
was
nine
miles
from
the
present
coastline
which
on
its
face
seems
unlikely
if
there's
been
any
change
in
the
coastline
or
rather
whether
it
was
nine
miles
from
some
other
baseline.
now
at
this
point,
texas
really
abandons
the
debate.
none
of
their
brief
is
addressed
to
the
question
what
nine
miles
from
land
means
in
the
boundary
act
of
1836.
texas'
entire
position
here
is
that
the
submerged
lands
act
tells
us
where
the
texas'
historic
boundary
was.
if
we
are
right
that
the
submerged
lands
act
does
not
resolve
this
question,
i
take
it
and
i
maybe
corrected
that
texas
has
no
further
argument
to
present.
and
that's
not
surprising
because
if
one
accepts
our
position
that
the
1836
act
fixes
the
old
historic
boundary
of
texas,
it's
perfectly
plain
that
that
boundary
had
no
relation
to
the
present
coastline
but
have
relation
rather
to
the
coastline
as
it
existed
at
that
time
or
a
few
years
later
in
1845
when
the
state
was
admitted
to
the
union.
now
as
i've
said,
the
texas
boundary
act
sets
a
boundary
for
texas
in
the
gulf
three
leagues
from
land.
three
leagues
being
the
first
nine
miles.
now
we
assume
that
land
in
that
context
means
below
water
mark
along
the
shoreline
rather
than
the
high
water
mark
or
some
intermediate
point.
in
that
respect,
we
accept
the
notion
that
the
waterline
involved
is
the
same
kind
of
waterline
that
is
spoken
of
in
the
submerged
lands
act.
but
there
are
at
least
three
reasons
why
harbor-works
cannot
have
been
included
in
this
nine-mile
belt
that
texas
had
as
a
matter
of
history.
the
first
and
really
dispositive
reason
is
that
these
harbor-works
did
not
exist
in
1845.
indeed,
there
were
no
harbor-works
thus
stipulated.
there
were
no
harbor-works
projecting
from
the
texas
coast
in
1845
when
that
state
was
admitted
in
the
union.
furthermore,
the
international
practice
of
fixing
international
boundaries
in
the
sense
of
territorial
sea
from
artificial
harbor-works
is
a
practice
that
developed
very
much
later
and
was
not
current
in
1845
and
because
it's
wholly
unlikely
that
texas
having
no
harbor-works
of
its
own
would
have
devised
a
new
and
radical
way
of
defining
its
own
boundary
contrary
to
the
then
international
practice.
finally
and
i've
even
stressed
this,
land,
the
word
used
by
the
texas
boundary
act,
tends
to
connote
not
artificial
structures
added
but
rather
the
natural
shoreline.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
harlan,
our
first
position
is
that
it
does
not.
it
would
extend
the
boundary
but
that
was
because
water
boundaries
as
then
as
now
all
viewed
as
ambulatory
to
the
extent
that
natural
and
perceptible
accretion
or
erosion
occurs.
that
simply
a
principle
of
water
boundary
law
as
i
understand
it
which
was
fully
recognized
at
that
debate.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
submerged
lands
act
is
viewed
as
confirming
the
texas
historic
boundary
as
it
would
exist
today,
we
would
have
to
concede
that
any
accretions
or
erosions
by
natural
forces
should
be
taken
into
account.
it
doesn't
seem
to
us
however
that
that's
really
what
the
submerged
lands
act
has
in
mind.
it
seems
to
us
rather
that
when
the
act
speaks
of
the
boundary
as
it
existed
at
the
time
of
admission,
it
means
as
it
was
then
located
and
as
i've
pointed
out
that
it
could
present
problems
of
retracing
the
boundary
but
i
think
those
problems
could
be
worked
out.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
i
--
but
i
--
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
it's
indisputable
that
the
boundary
of
texas
as
fixed
by
the
1836
act
did
shift
and
had
it
ever
been
recognized
by
the
united
states
or
by
the
courts
would
have
shifted
in
all
this
time
and
certainly
shifted
between
1836
and
1845.
the
only
reason
for
not
taking
shifts
after
1845
into
account
is
that
the
submerged
lands
act
seems
to
throw
us
back
to
that
date
and
to
say
we
will
reconstruct
things
as
they
were
then.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that's
our
first
premise
but
we
do
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
--
we
concede
that
it
would
be
a
quite
reasonable
reading
rather
to
think
of
it
as
endorsing
the
principle
--
endorsing
not
the
principle,
the
boundary
with
all
its
subsequent
shifts
in
either
direction
which
is
it
--
turns
out
in
the
case
of
texas
may
very
well
cancel
each
other
out.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
section
2(a)(2)
mr.
justice
white
on
page
25
of
our
brief
about
the
middle
of
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
and
to
the
boundary
of
each
such
state
that
identical
language
is
reproduced
in
section
4.
and
in
both
instances
with
respect
to
boundary
at
the
time
of
admission,
the
words
are
as
it
existed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that
is
our
ultimate
conclusion
but
i
want
to
hasten
to
add
mr.
justice
fortas
that
it
applies
to
texas.
insofar
as
texas
claims
three
miles
which
it
could
do
in
--
where
there
was
a
tremendous
accretion,
it's
conceivable
that
the
three-mile
grant
from
the
present
coastline
would
be
more
beneficial
than
the
nine-mile
grant
from
an
old
shoreline.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
fortas
because
all
the
court
did
in
united
states
versus
california
was
construe
a
present
grant
from
present
coastlines.
and
in
order
to
determine
how
a
present
coastline
was
to
be
located,
the
court
found
it
useful
to
refer,
to
adopt
the
rules
of
the
international
convention
then
recently
ratified
by
the
united
states
which
are
at
least
harbor-works
is
part
of
the
coastline.
there
were
two
considerations
present
in
the
california
case
which
are
not
present
here.
the
first
was
the
court
was
concerned
that
the
international
boundary
and
the
state
boundary
so
far
as
possible
be
one
and
the
same.
since
the
united
states
for
international
purposes
that
adopted
the
rule
of
the
convention
which
included
harbor-works
are
--
it
was
proper
to
do
the
same
with
respect
to
the
state
boundary.
but
that
consideration
does
not
apply
here
of
course
because
here
we're
dealing
with
a
boundary
that's
nine
miles
out
which
in
no
event
can
be
coextensive
with
the
international
boundary
which
is
only
three
miles
out.
so
that
consideration
of
co-extensiveness
simply
doesn't
weigh
here.
but
more
important
perhaps
in
the
california
case,
the
court
was
construing
a
new
grant
of
three
miles
from
present
coastlines
and
was
taking
the
modern
view
as
to
what
a
coastline
was.
here
on
the
contrary,
the
court
is
asked
to
construe
a
grant
to
--
on
historic
boundary
which
has
no
necessary
relation
to
any
coastline
much
to
as
to
a
modern
coastline.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
first
mr.
justice
fortas
turning
to
page
25,
section
2(a)(2).
we
get
all
lands
and
now
i
skip
permanently
title
lands
that
are
not
involved
here.
all
lands
seaward
--
skipping
to
the
third
line.
all
lands
seaward
to
a
line
three
geographical
miles
distant
from
the
coastline
of
each
such
state.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
court
so
held
and
we
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
now,
and
further,
and
to
the
boundary
line
of
each
such
state
where
in
any
case
such
boundary
as
it
existed
at
the
time
such
state
became
a
member
of
the
union
or
is
here
before
approved
by
the
congress.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
frankly
don't
see
any
other
way
to
read
it
mr.--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
frankly
don't
see
any
other
way
to
read
it
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
appreciate
it.
that
may
be
their
argument.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'd
--
i
agree
with
that.
i
would
draw
your
honors
attention
also
to
section
4,
pages
26
and
27,
leaving
aside
the
first
sentence
which
is
again
referring
to
the
three-mile
arbitrary
grant,
three
geographical
miles
distant
from
its
coastline,
meaning
its
present
coastline
as
construed
by
this
court
in
the
california
case.
now
it
--no
reference
to
coastline
any
longer
when
we
are
talking
about
the
further
grant
in
the
last
sentence
on
page
27
which
reserves
the
question
of
historic
boundaries.
we
have
nothing
in
this
section
as
to
be
construed
as
prejudicing
and
so
forth.
the
existence
of
any
state
seaward
boundary
beyond
three
geographical
miles
if
it
was
so
provided
by
its
constitutional
laws
prior
to
at
the
time
of
such
state
became
a
member
of
the
union.
again,
we're
thrown
back,
you
get
three
miles,
you
get
so
much
more
as
you
had
at
the
time
of
admission.
and
how
one
could
determine
what
you
had
at
the
time
of
admission
by
reference
to
harbor-works
which
were
constructed
50
years
later
is
difficult
to
grasp.
now
let
me
say
finally
that
our
submission
doesn't
seem
to
us
in
anyway
unfair
to
texas.
i've
already
mentioned
in
passing
that
texas
may
at
any
time
he
chooses
take
full
advantage
of
the
three-mile
grant
which
every
state
received.
there
are
some
suggestion
in
the
brief
that
a
nine-mile
limit
computed
the
way
we
compute
it
might
end
up
by
denying
the
state
any
present
marginal
sea
whatever.
that
is
not
true
because
when
you
come
to
that
point
when
there's
that
much
accretion
then
you
may
switch
to
the
three-mile
grant.
and
you
can
combine
the
two
and
you
can
change
your
mind
at
any
time.
texas
has
no
need
to
opt
nor
does
it
have
to
--
have
the
same
--
head
of
the
grant
for
each
portion
of
its
coast.
in
some,
the
rule
we
urge
applies
to
texas
and
it
applies
to
every
other
state
in
the
same
situation
so
happens
that
there
was
only
one
other
state,
florida
which
prevailed
it
having
a
boundary
beyond
three
miles.
that's
the
only
reason
this
seems
like
a
rule
specially
fashioned
for
texas
in
fact
it
is
not.
and
in
reverse,
the
rule
of
the
california
case
applies
to
every
state
including
texas
with
respect
to
the
three-mile
grant.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
florida
was
of
course
served
by
us
as
a
party
to
this
litigation
and
i
had
rather
anticipated
that
florida
might
be
here
speaking
since
it
has
a
possible
interest
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
frankly
don't
know
mr.
justice
harlan
whether
there
are
any
jetties
so
--
which
would
be
involved
in
florida.
perhaps
not
and
perhaps
that's
why
they're
disinterested
or
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
that
is
so
--
no.
i
should
add
that
there
is
one
--
the
rule
that
you
look
to
the
historic
document
rather
than
to
the
submerged
lands
act
to
determine
where
you
start
measuring
the
historic
belt
of
course
applies
to
florida
as
it
does
here.
the
historic
documents
in
the
case
of
florida
would
of
course
be
their
own
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
take
it
though
that
they
have
had
a
full
notice
and
opportunity
to
appear.
we
have
no
present
dispute
with
florida
that
turns
on
the
question
presented
here
or
perhaps
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
could
advice
the
court
more
firmly
that
we
anticipate
no
such
problem
with
florida
with
respect
to
this
question
of
harbor-works.
there
may
be
other
questions
that
turn
on
this
principle
in
the
broader
sense.
there
are
decisions,
the
decree
in
this
case
or
the
decree
of
the
florida
case
speaks
of
three-leagues
from
coastline
then
adopts
the
definition
of
the
submerged
lands
act
without
i
suppose
meaning
to
resolve
the
question
we
have
here
today.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
but
there
may
be
in
that
some
questions
with
florida
as
well.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
not
clear
about
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
so
happens
that
the
particular
harbor-works
that
we
are
focusing
on,
the
galveston
and
sabine
were
in
existence
in
1953.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
--
as
i
remember,
that's
the
--
that
was
a
--
well,
in
the
california
case,
i
think
we
argued
for
a
coastline
as
of
1953
rather
than
offer
the
rules
applicable
to
coastline
as
1953
rather
than
the
later
rules.
i
should
suppose
that
we
would
concede
that
one
could
include
not
only
this
but
any
future
harbor-works
if
the
rule
is
not
1845
but
1953
--
if
it's
not
1845
then
it's
open-ended
i
think.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
oh,
as
for
the
future,
yes
that
is
possible.
i
will
now
cede
a
few
minutes
to
mr.
sachse
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
louisiana
and
reserve
what
time
remains
for
rebuttal
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
a
word
about
louisiana,
perhaps
i've
been
too
accommodating.
i'm
taken
by
surprise
by
the
suggestion
louisiana
makes
that
in
no
event
should
this
case
be
decided
until
the
arguments
with
respect
to
the
louisiana
coastlines
are
to
be
settled
and
that
case
conceivably
may
require
reference
to
a
master
and
therefore
delay
the
resolution
of
this
one
for
a
very
long
time
if
that
suggestion
were
adopted.
i
had
thought
louisiana
agreed
with
us
that
this
case
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
louisiana
or
with
the
louisiana
coastline
but
the
principle
involved
here
cannot
under
--
in
any
way
affect
louisiana,
though
it
can
affect
florida.
as
to
florida,
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
florida
perhaps
should
be
here.
i,
on
the
other
hand,
feel
that
perhaps
that's
their
responsibility.
they
had
been
said
with
all
papers
in
this
case
from
the
very
beginning
had
chosen
not
to
appear
because
they
appear
not
to
be
concerned,
and
i
don't
know
that
this
rather
pressing
dispute
should
be
delayed
on
that
account.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
sure
they
do,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
know
that
we
made
a
special
point
of
--
we
served
all
the
states
but
we
were
careful
of
knowing
that
florida
could
be
concerned
to
assert
them.
i
remind
the
court
that
this
proceeding
began
by
an
ex
parte
restraining
order
issued
on
one
day's
notice
by
this
court.
it
involves
valuable
islands
which
neither
side
is
drilling
at
the
moment
under
an
agreement
not
to
do
so.
and
unlike
the
louisiana
case
where
there's
a
working
agreement
which
permits
drilling
in
the
interim,
here
there
is
none
and
here
i
speak
perhaps
more
on
behalf
of
texas
than
on
behalf
of
united
states.
texas
has
voluntarily
withheld
any
action
in
this
area
and
i
don't
know
that
they
should
be
required
to
do
so
indefinitely
simply
because
louisiana
has
what
i
concede
to
be
unjustified
fears
if
this
court's
going
astray
in
its
decision
here.
one
word
about
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
this
question
here,
mr.
justice
black
of
--
the
ruling
here
should
we
prevail
will
govern
the
florida
coastline,
whether
that's
of
any
impractical
importance
or
not
i
don't
know
but
they
will
be
affected
in
theory
by
the
ruling
here,
whether
in
practice
--
it
makes
any
difference
whether
there's
any
oil
involved
or
any
reason
of
care,
i
don't
know.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
on
the
contrary,
mr.
justice
black,
i
am
suggesting
that
florida
had
ample
notice
and
opportunity
to
appear
here
if
it
thought
itself
importantly
affected
by
the
ruling
that
would
be
made
in
this
case.
it
shows
not
to
appear
here,
i
(inaudible)
--
i
had
no
reason
to
say
that
that
wasn't
informed
and
intelligent
choice
on
its
part.
and
therefore,
i
would
not
suggest
that
the
court
should
re-invite
florida
which
of
course
was
always
a
party.
there's
no
question
of
its
obtaining
leave
to
file.
it
could've
simply
responded
as
texas
did.
at
least,
it's
my
understanding
of
the
nature
of
this
original
case.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
am
so.
one,
word
about
the
argument
made
by
the
attorney
general
of
texas,
most
of
that
argument,
if
i
understood
it
correctly,
was
about
whether
our
first
argument
or
whether
our
second
argument
ought
to
prevail
whether
this
is
an
ambulatory
boundary
or
whether
it's
fixed
as
of
1845.
that
is
the
point
and
the
only
point
to
which
mr.
shalowitz's
treaties
addresses
itself.
he
favors
the
second
argument
we
make,
the
common
law
rule
that
would
have
an
ambulatory
boundary,
but
not
a
changing
boundary.
to
include
harbor-works,
you'd
have
to
have
a
change
in
the
boundary.
only
natural
accretion
would
be
included
within
the
ambulatory
maritime
boundary.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
will
do
so,
mr.
justice.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
if
the
court
should
hold
that
the
california
principle
applies
to
texas,
then
of
course
we
would
concede
that
new
harbor-works
would
move
the
boundary
out
and
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
for
purposes
of
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
of
this
act.
and
incidentally
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
oh,
we
have
taken
the
contrary
position
but
now
--
the
court
having
ruled
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
as
insofar
as
changes
of
fact,
not
insofar
as
changes
of
law.
if
the
united
states
should
have
a
new
international
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
should
it
adhere
to
a
new
convention
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
a
new
harbor-work
i
take
it
would
clearly
throw
out
the
boundary
by
that
much.
and
incidentally,
extensions
do
not
--
are
not
limited
to
reasonable
extensions.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct,
but
there
was
an
answer
that
only
reasonable
extensions
of
these
jetties
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
would
extend
the
boundary
under
a
california
case
were
it
applicable
here
by
that
much.
the
rule
of
that
reasonable
extensions
applies
only
to
things
which
are
assimilated
to
harbor-works
but
which
are
not
full-fledged
harbor-works.
these
are
conceded
to
be
full-fledged
harbor-works.
one
last
thing
i'd
like
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
is
the
legislative
history
here
on
pages
13
and
14
of
our
brief,
which
make
it
very
clear
that
the
congress
had
in
mind
that
--
with
respect
to
the
three-mile
boundary,
you
had
to
start
from
the
modern
coastlines.
senator
long
suggesting
to
the
contrary
was
rebuffed.
on
the
other
hand,
the
senator
who
persuaded
him
to
withdraw
his
suggestion
admitted
that
when
you
went
beyond
the
three
miles,
then
louisiana
as
any
other
state
would
look
to
its
historic
boundary.
