mr.
crawford
c.
martin
may
it
please
the
court.
to
start
with,
i'm
sorry.
there
has
maybe
some
confusion.
mr.
houghton
brownlee
preceded
here
the
--
i
noticed
the
printed
docket
showed
otherwise
and
i
explained
that
--
so
you'll
understand
that
was
mr.
price
daniel
was
to
make
it
--
opening
argument
because
he
had
made
the
argument
in
1950
and
also
in
1960
for
this
court
and
he
was
employed
by
the
state
of
texas
and
did
the
briefing
in
this
matter
and
mr.
brownlee
just
took
his
place
in
the
matter
--
in
the
case
--
excuse
me
sirs.
i
think
generally
speaking,
the
solicitor
had
been
quite
fair
in
his
brief
and
argument
in
meeting
the
weakness
of
the
government's
position
in
this
case.
however,
that
one
argument
of
that
which
is
not
exactly
fair
and
i
think
is
completely
erroneous
and
refer
plaintiff's
contention
here.
a
minute
ago
that
we're
in
other
words
talking
about
who
stands
to
gain
in
this
case.
in
the
first
place,
we're
going
to
stand
on
the
law
in
the
case
but
i
do
want
to
examine
that
in
just
a
moment
and
that
is
if
in
the
brief
and
he
didn't
refer
to
here
but
i
wanted
--
he's
got
--
as
you
know
we
don't
get
the
last
say
until
we
have
to
answer
these
things
as
it
may
come
out
in
his
argument
--
closing
arguments.
he
said,
we
are
thinking
to
combine
the
most
favorable
elements
of
these
two
rules
in
order
to
end
up
a
more
land.
well,
that
is
not
so.
not
necessarily
so.
we're
not
certain
because
we
don't
know
where
that
1845
was
ourselves.
we
do
know
for
a
fact
that
the
galveston
is
along
the
coast.
let
me
show
that
in
your
brief
to
answer
the
question
that
the
court
asked
a
minute
a
go,
the
jetty
at
galveston
if
you
can
notice,
it
said
it
does
hug
the
coast
and
goes
if
not,
directly
out
into
the
ocean.
we
do
also
know
--
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
sir,
yes
sir.
i'm
sorry.
there
was
--
one
must
too
--
it
would
be
--
they
didn't
number
it.
it
comes
on
after
page
4
over
the
next
page
sir.
printer
didn't
do
that,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
but
it
shows
the
galveston
area
also
shows
on
the
left
side,
you'll
see
the
calcasieu
pass
there
in
which
--
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
sir?
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
yes
sir.
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
that's
correct
sir.
now,
let
me
say
in
the
first
place
that
beginning
with
the
coastline,
we're
only
attempting
--
gentlemen,
we're
only
attempting
and
we're
not
trying
to
gain
advantage.
we're
only
attempting
to
follow
what
we
think
congress
--
intended
what
the
congress
said
and
what
you
confirmed
in
the
1965
california
case.
in
addition
to
that,
we
feel
like
that
the
calcasieu
--
the
louisiana
case
also
carry
that
part
so
a
far
as
the
gulf
is
concerned.
now,
i
want
to
talk
in
just
a
moment
about
just
the
coast.
second
place
is
modern
coast.
it's
not
always
the
most
favored
in
our
state.
we
have
now
before
us
galveston
island
where
americans
stormed
1900,
i
think
everyone
heard
of
the
1900
storm.
congress
had
a
hearing
on
that
and
they
found
that
in
a
house
document,
a
beach
erosion
in
galveston,
texas
which
is
cited
at
page
28
in
our
brief
and
i'll
read
from
that.
early
surveyed
of
shore
show
that
prior
to
construction
of
the
jetty,
there
was
an
extensive
erosion
on
most
of
the
reach.
now,
what
they
we
mean
reach
is
the
east
beach
to
the
10th
street
but
a
maximum
section
of
shoreline
from
1838
to
1875
of
about
2,000
feet.
now,
that
is
cited
to
you
to
show
that
this
is
the
very
point
that
we're
talking
about
in
this
case
of
the
galveston
jetty
close
to
it
and
we
certainly
--
2,000
feet
projected
out
into
the
gulf
would
probably
give
us
more
the
other
way
around.
i
may
say
also
that
we
don't
interpret
this
act.
maybe
the
justice
department
might
change
their
mind
about
--
we
don't
interpret
it.
we
can
come
and
go
and
select
is
--
what
we
want
and
what
part
of
the
beach
should
go
up.
if
i
understood
that
correctly,
we
don't
--
we
didn't
know
that
and
we're
not
standing
on
that
this
morning
because
we
didn't
know
that
--
didn't
understand
that
to
be
the
position
of
the
united
states
because
we
thought
that
we
had
to
choose
once
and
choose
only
once
and
once
we
chose,
we
had
to
stand
by
it
and
that's
the
position
we've
taken
here
this
morning
and
that
our
entire
coast
stands
on
the
proof
of
our
historic
boundary.
at
galveston,
we
have
this
present
coast
is
much
less
than
it
was
in
1845.
our
trouble
there
of
course
is
--
justice
harlan
said
a
minute
ago
pointed
out
that
it's
almost
impossible
to
determine
where
the
coast
was
in
1845
because
in
--
prior
to
--
along
in
the
middle
50's
there
was
no
maps
and
even
up
until
the
present
time
that
parts
of
the
beach
have
never
been
exactly
charted
and
that's
why
--
let
me
explain
right
in
there.
that's
why
that
the
matter
was
left
to
this
court
as
stated
in
the
california
case
rather
in
congress
try
to
put
it
in
there.
you
remembered
one
time
in
the
hearings
is
brought
out
in
the
california
case
that
the
attorney
general
brought
in
and
thought
they
would
attach
a
map
to
the
act
and
this
would
settle
everything.
will
it
create
such
a
few
or
that
it
--
it
will
soon
drop
out
and
the
mapped
part
was
not
there
anymore
at
all.
now,
i
want
to
go
to
--
back
to
the
law
gentlemen.
regardless
of
which
the
governments
hurts
or
helps,
i
think
mr.
brownlee's
arguments
in
our
brief
clearly
shows
submerged
lands
act
contains
only
one
baseline
and
one
coastline
and
that's
our
contention
here
and
i
don't
think
it
was
quite
brought
out
enough
in
our
appendix.
we
have
stipulated
as
far
as
the
facts
are
concerned.
we
don't
stipulate
to
force
foreign
law
because
it
wouldn't
be
binding
on
this
court
that
there
were
no
artificial
harbor-works
or
other
structures
existing
in
the
gulf
and
in
texas
in
1845
but
the
most
important
one
is
here
and
that
is
the
jetties
at
sabine,
that's
where
--locally,
we
pronounced
it
sabine
and
galveston
harbor,
our
permanent
harbor-works
constituting
an
integral
part
of
our
harbor
system
within
the
meaning
of
article
8
of
the
convention
of
the
territorial
sea
and
taking
a
contiguous
zone
and
that
is
as
far
as
i
can
see
is
there
is
no
fact
question
gentlemen.
there
is
no
fact
question
involved.
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
yes
sir.
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
no
sir.
my
understanding
to
it
--
what
--
that
was
the
government's
contention.
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
as
i
understand
what
you
asked
sir
was
that
you
said
that
the
treaty
as
it
was
when
it
was
signed
by
the
president
in
1961
would
be
as
the
treaty
was
at
that
particular
time.
in
my
understanding
of
the
treaty
is
that
--
in
my
understanding
with
the
hold
of
this
court
is
that
if
there's
any
additional
harbor-works
are
built
that
it
extends
the
coastline
out
to
where
that
was.
that's
my
understanding
of
it.
i
may
be
wrong.
they
did
not
--
they
--
let
me
say
that
this
is
in
the
california
case
your
honor.
is
in
that
case
95
or
99%
of
the
argument
was
over
where
this
islands
out
there
where
you
could
draw
a
line
around
these
islands
out
there
and
include
all
of
that
in
the
inland
waters.
and
that
--
and
only
--
is
only
about
two
sentences
in
the
california
case
with
concern
to
this
case
and
that's
my
understanding
of
it.
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
yes
sir.
that's
--
in
other
words,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
those
were
not
built
with
the
state
of
texas.
they
were
built
by
the
federal
government
but
that's
--
in
other
words,
as
i
understand
this,
the
majority
of
this
court
when
erode
on
it,
it
was
--
one
of
the
efforts
was
to
fix
the
treaty
to
be
the
same
law
that
you
would
have
--
i
will
--
they
would
be
the
same
as
i
understand
it.
and
that
is
the
law
because
as
i
understand,
the
treaty
says
that
the
inland
waters
shall
be
the
outer
most
part
of
those
and
it
was
the
desire
of
this
court
to
make
one
uniform
law
which
would
follow
the
treaty.
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
yes
sir.
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
let
me
put
that
that
we
--
this
is
covered
part
of
the
stipulation.
there
is
a
part
in
the
treaty
that
says
it
becomes
unreasonable
than
you
disregard
it.
now,
i
didn't
want
to
go
into
that
because
we
had
stipulated
on
this
particular
ones
that
we
have
in
front
of
us
and
that
is
in
the
treaty
that
it
becomes
now
--
and
there's
no
doubt
in
my
mind
i
think
the
court
intended
to
follow
that
rule
and
that
rule
is
what
this
court
laid
down
and
this
court
had
skid
away
from
controversy
throughout
the
california.
if
california
extended
their
jetties
out
to
far
to
make
it
unreasonable
then
under
the
treaty
--
and
then
you
followed
it.
this
court
follows
a
treaty,
therefore
it
would
not
be
included.
that's
my
answer
sir.
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
first,
the
--
let
me
say
this
that
the
government's
chief
witness
and
advisor
in
the
california
case,
mr.
aaron
l.
shalowitz,
one
of
the
leading
experts
in
sea
and
shore
boundaries
while
he
was
in
florida
by
the
coast
and
geodetic
survey,
he
wrote
a
book
and
has
always
desired
when
you're
arguing
if
the
other
fellow
write
a
book.
he's
written
a
book
here
and
as
put
out
by
the
united
states
department
of
commerce
post
geodetic
survey.
and
if
the
court
would
bear
with
me
just
a
moment,
i
would
like
to
just
to
turn
to
page
167
and
the
part
--
and
this
book
was
put
out
in
order
to
be
--
the
federal
agencies
might
be
able
to
interpret.
this
is
the
interpretation
of
the
submerged
lands
act
they
put
out
in
order
so
they
might
have
some
guideline.
i
begin
reading
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
reading
that
as
a
whole
together
with
the
discussions
however
it
seems
reasonable
to
assume
that
what
the
congress
wished
to
preserve
for
the
states
was
a
concept
of
distance,
fixed
as
of
the
date
of
admission,
three
miles
or
six
miles
and
so
forth
rather
than
the
concept
of
a
fixed
line
in
the
water.
under
this
interpretation,
the
historic
distance
would
be
applied
to
the
present
coastline
to
fix
out
a
boundary
of
the
state.
and
i
drop
on
down
--
he's
got
just
a
little
bit
more.
if
this
the
--
the
submerged
lands
act
is
encored
with
the
common
law
rule
which
is
a
federal
rule
that
where
the
sea
is
a
boundary,
the
doctrine
of
erosion
and
accretion
is
normally
applicable
and
the
boundary
shifts
with
the
change.
and
if
you
bear
with
me
just
a
moment,
i
won't
to
read
one
more
sentence.
from
the
practical
point
of
view,
the
sea
or
present
coastline
is
a
logical
solution
or
it
would
be
exceeded
difficult
if
not
impossible
task
to
determine
the
line
of
ordinary
low
water
mark
in
a
distant
past
talking
about
the
past
years.
act
--
that
surveys
of
our
coast
did
not
begin
to
come
available
until
the
middle
of
the
19th
century
and
in
mini-sections
of
low
waterline
is
never
actually
been
surveyed.
that
i
think
is
this
man,
as
far
as
i
can
see
is
a
well-reasoned
book
and
not
just
because
it
was
but
it
--
he
has
done
a
tremendous
job.
now,
i
want
to
pass
another
question
and
that
is
that
the
government
in
this
case
took
the
exact
opposite
view
in
the
california
case
and
in
that
case,
of
course
this
court
found
against
him.
and
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
gave
his
interpretations
exactly
in
the
final
brief
in
the
california
case
and
i
want
to
quote
from
it
since
it's
--
we
feel
directly
in
point,
"we
now
concede
that
the
submerged
lands
act
by
making
a
grant
measure
from
the
coastline
in
existence
the
day
of
the
act
has
given
the
state
the
benefit
of
artificial
works
in
existence
at
that
time".
further
--
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
oh,
at
the
time
of
the
time
the
act
was
passed,
1953.
now,
your
honors,
so
when
it
was
viewed,
you
all
came
along
--
the
court
came
along
with
--
and
when
you
adopted
the
treaty,
well,
the
last
thing
that
it
took
till
'53
and
there's
no
dispute
that
these
--
i
mean,
that's
what
we
stipulated.
there's
no
dispute
that
our
harbor-works
were
there
in
'53.
i'd
like
to
read
just
one
more
sentence
that
i'd
add
what
congress
intended
this
definition
to
embrace
the
same
shoreline,
an
outer
limit
of
the
inland
waters
as
were
then
recognized
for
the
purpose
of
international
law,
those
were
the
active
shore
where
the
natural
or
artificial,
that's
footnote
16,
and
other
outer
limits
of
inland
water
whether
natural
or
artificially
enclosed.
of
course
that's
all
cited
in
our
brief
your
honor.
now
then,
the
solicitor's
brief
on
page
16
makes
a
further
concession
that
the
interpretation
sought
here
by
the
government
may
be
incorrect
and
already
foreclosed
by
the
basic
opinion
of
the
case.
and
what
we've
--
what
we
--
what
we're
working
with
here
this
morning
is
what
is
in
the
brief.
some
of
the
things
that
were
said
here
this
morning,
we
were
taken
a
little
bit
by
surprise,
but
we're
going
to
define
or
argue
the
best
that
we
can
to
what
we
--
what
is
in
the
brief.
i
start
here,
it
says
the
reading,
and
that's
on
page
16,
the
reading
of
the
submerged
lands
act
just
suggested
is
not
the
only
permissible
one.
i
want
to
show
you
the
government
says
that
you
can
interpret
it
either
way.
the
purpose
of
congress
in
granting
the
gulf
states
the
submerged
land
within
their
boundaries
as
they
existed,
that's
in
quotation,
when
the
state
was
admitted
to
the
union
may
well
have
been
to
give
each
such
state
not
the
particular
area
what
--
that
it
claimed
at
the
time
but
the
area
it
would
today
enjoy
if
its
historic
boundary
had
been
effective
against
the
claims
of
the
united
states
held
to
be
paramount
in
united
states
versus
texas.
there's
a
support
for
this
view
in
the
court's
first
opinion
in
the
present
case.
and
we
feel
like
that
in
closing,
we
feel
like
that
that
is
exactly
what
we
have
here.
i
want
to
say
in
one
of
the
footnotes
here,
you'll
find
that
--
and
i
believe
co-counsel
mentioned
a
minute
ago,
but
i'm
afraid
maybe
the
court,
some
of
you
didn't
hear
it.
mr.
justice,
i
will
comment
attorney
general
clark
at
that
time
when
he
filed
his
original
case.
that's
about
taking
in
new
harbors.
it
was
a
great
out
draft
about
the
matter
and
in
his
brief
in
the
footnote,
we
have
it
in
our
brief
here,
he
said
we
do
not
and
do
not
in
--
at
any
time
intend
to
take
the
harbor-work,
claim
them
to
the
united
states.
that
was
in
his
footnote
there
and
that's
the
reason
why
when
you
go
in
to
the
reading
of
the
congressional
journal
and
there
are
hearings
you
don't
find
a
lot
to
talk
about
it
because
the
government
had
no
time
intended
the
--
claimed
it.
not
until
we
got
this
particular
complaint
a
few
months
ago
that
we
know
that
the
government
at
any
time
intended
to
because
what
you
have
here
is
you
have
a
very
narrow
issue
like
--
as
i
understand
the
government's
case,
they
say
we
want
to
come
back
and
we
want
to
start
your
baseline
or
your
coastline,
it
means
one
thing
to
texas.
and
california,
louisiana,
your
coastline
means
something
else.
we
feel
like
that
the
act
only
contained
one
definition
of
coastline
and
one
definition
only
and
is
applicable
to
both
of
the
states.
now,
in
closing,
gentlemen,
i
want
to
read
to
you
just
a
moment
a
little
bit
more
and
i'll
be
through.
i'll
go
to
page
32
and
i'll
discuss
it,
but
i
want
it
first
so
i'll
be
sure
that
i
won't
get
my
language
boiled
up.
i
don't
want
to
stay
with
it.
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
of
our
brief,
sir.
that
is
the
original
decree
of
this
--
in
this
case,
this
is
--
i
believe
have
been
--
brought
out
a
lot
of
rule
but
i
want
to
make
--
they'll
be
sure
about
it
because
this
is
i
think
is
important.
decree
in
this
case
has
awarded
texas
title
to
the
submerged
lands
seaward
from
its
present
coastline
including
the
harbor-works
and
this
--
go
into
the
act.
the
act
says,
coastline
--
and
in
the
decree,
the
decree
that
this
court
entered
said
the
coastline
means
a
line
of
ordinary
low
water
along
that
portion
of
the
coast
which
is
in
direct
contact
to
the
open
sea
and
the
line
marking
the
seaward
limits
of
inland
water.
as
against
the
united
states,
the
defendant
states
are
respectfully
entitled
to
all
lands,
minerals,
and
other
natural
resources
underlying
the
mex
--
the
gulf
of
mexico.
i
didn't
just
say
louisiana.
i'm
talking
about
the
gulf
of
mexico.
this
is
your
decree,
entering
seaward
from
their
coastline
for
a
distance
of
three
leagues
in
the
case
of
texas
in
florida
and
three
geographic
miles
in
the
case
of
louisiana,
mississippi
and
alabama,
and
the
united
states
is
not
entitled
as
against
any
such
state
to
any
interest
in
such
lands,
minerals
or
resources
with
exceptions
provided
under
section
5,
which
is
not
applicable.
now
that's
--
that
is
43
u.s.c.
1313.
when
this
code
--
when
this
decree
was
entered
in
december
the
12th,
1960,
the
term
coastline,
i
call
your
attention,
that
the
term
coastline
had
already
been
defined
in
a
gulf
so
far
as
i
concede.
i
think
it
was
certain
there
united
states
recognized
as
early
in
their
brief
show,
as
early
as
1930.
they
recognized
that
the
inland
waters
included
the
harbor-works.
i
agree
with
you
that
it
was
in
fact
in
1836
because
it
was
of
no
concern
at
that
time.
but
in
1930,
this
nation
began
and
i
want
to
say
that
the
treaty
that
was
entered
into
in
1958
ordinary
thing
in
the
world
but
codifying,
i
think
the
government
was
(inaudible)
read
this
was
not
anything
would
work
but
codifying
what
the
rule
already
was.
and
in
that
debate
over
there
on
adopting
the
treaty,
since
this
is
footnoted
in
our
brief,
when
it
was
adopted,
i
believe,
"no
way".
they
said,
"no,
no,
let's
put
the
word
"may'
in
there"
and
the
french
came
back
and
said,
(inaudible)
came
back
and
said,
"no
sir,
we
will
leave
the
word
"shall'
in
there
and
that
is
in
the
treaty,
shall
be,
include
the
harbor-works".
now,
that's
our
position
in
the
matter.
gentlemen,
we
feel
that
the
1958
rule
had
been
further
confirmed
by
this
treaty
and
your
adoptions
of
the
treaty
as
your
rule.
and
therefore
the
case
as
far
as
texas
is
concerned
that
there'd
only
be
one
coastline
and
that
the
congress
didn't
intend
two
coastlines,
it'd
be
one
coastline
and
it
would
be
applicable
to
all
the
states.
unless
there's
further
question,
that
concludes
our
presentation
to
it.
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
may
it
please
the
court.
to
start
with,
i'm
sorry.
there
has
maybe
some
confusion.
mr.
houghton
brownlee
preceded
here
the
--
i
noticed
the
printed
docket
showed
otherwise
and
i
explained
that
--
so
you'll
understand
that
was
mr.
price
daniel
was
to
make
it
--
opening
argument
because
he
had
made
the
argument
in
1950
and
also
in
1960
for
this
court
and
he
was
employed
by
the
state
of
texas
and
did
the
briefing
in
this
matter
and
mr.
brownlee
just
took
his
place
in
the
matter
--
in
the
case
--
excuse
me
sirs.
i
think
generally
speaking,
the
solicitor
had
been
quite
fair
in
his
brief
and
argument
in
meeting
the
weakness
of
the
government's
position
in
this
case.
however,
that
one
argument
of
that
which
is
not
exactly
fair
and
i
think
is
completely
erroneous
and
refer
plaintiff's
contention
here.
a
minute
ago
that
we're
in
other
words
talking
about
who
stands
to
gain
in
this
case.
in
the
first
place,
we're
going
to
stand
on
the
law
in
the
case
but
i
do
want
to
examine
that
in
just
a
moment
and
that
is
if
in
the
brief
and
he
didn't
refer
to
here
but
i
wanted
--
he's
got
--
as
you
know
we
don't
get
the
last
say
until
we
have
to
answer
these
things
as
it
may
come
out
in
his
argument
--
closing
arguments.
he
said,
we
are
thinking
to
combine
the
most
favorable
elements
of
these
two
rules
in
order
to
end
up
a
more
land.
well,
that
is
not
so.
not
necessarily
so.
we're
not
certain
because
we
don't
know
where
that
1845
was
ourselves.
we
do
know
for
a
fact
that
the
galveston
is
along
the
coast.
let
me
show
that
in
your
brief
to
answer
the
question
that
the
court
asked
a
minute
a
go,
the
jetty
at
galveston
if
you
can
notice,
it
said
it
does
hug
the
coast
and
goes
if
not,
directly
out
into
the
ocean.
we
do
also
know
--
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
sir,
yes
sir.
i'm
sorry.
there
was
--
one
must
too
--
it
would
be
--
they
didn't
number
it.
it
comes
on
after
page
4
over
the
next
page
sir.
printer
didn't
do
that,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
but
it
shows
the
galveston
area
also
shows
on
the
left
side,
you'll
see
the
calcasieu
pass
there
in
which
--
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
sir?
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
yes
sir.
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
that's
correct
sir.
now,
let
me
say
in
the
first
place
that
beginning
with
the
coastline,
we're
only
attempting
--
gentlemen,
we're
only
attempting
and
we're
not
trying
to
gain
advantage.
we're
only
attempting
to
follow
what
we
think
congress
--
intended
what
the
congress
said
and
what
you
confirmed
in
the
1965
california
case.
in
addition
to
that,
we
feel
like
that
the
calcasieu
--
the
louisiana
case
also
carry
that
part
so
a
far
as
the
gulf
is
concerned.
now,
i
want
to
talk
in
just
a
moment
about
just
the
coast.
second
place
is
modern
coast.
it's
not
always
the
most
favored
in
our
state.
we
have
now
before
us
galveston
island
where
americans
stormed
1900,
i
think
everyone
heard
of
the
1900
storm.
congress
had
a
hearing
on
that
and
they
found
that
in
a
house
document,
a
beach
erosion
in
galveston,
texas
which
is
cited
at
page
28
in
our
brief
and
i'll
read
from
that.
early
surveyed
of
shore
show
that
prior
to
construction
of
the
jetty,
there
was
an
extensive
erosion
on
most
of
the
reach.
now,
what
they
we
mean
reach
is
the
east
beach
to
the
10th
street
but
a
maximum
section
of
shoreline
from
1838
to
1875
of
about
2,000
feet.
now,
that
is
cited
to
you
to
show
that
this
is
the
very
point
that
we're
talking
about
in
this
case
of
the
galveston
jetty
close
to
it
and
we
certainly
--
2,000
feet
projected
out
into
the
gulf
would
probably
give
us
more
the
other
way
around.
i
may
say
also
that
we
don't
interpret
this
act.
maybe
the
justice
department
might
change
their
mind
about
--
we
don't
interpret
it.
we
can
come
and
go
and
select
is
--
what
we
want
and
what
part
of
the
beach
should
go
up.
if
i
understood
that
correctly,
we
don't
--
we
didn't
know
that
and
we're
not
standing
on
that
this
morning
because
we
didn't
know
that
--
didn't
understand
that
to
be
the
position
of
the
united
states
because
we
thought
that
we
had
to
choose
once
and
choose
only
once
and
once
we
chose,
we
had
to
stand
by
it
and
that's
the
position
we've
taken
here
this
morning
and
that
our
entire
coast
stands
on
the
proof
of
our
historic
boundary.
at
galveston,
we
have
this
present
coast
is
much
less
than
it
was
in
1845.
our
trouble
there
of
course
is
--
justice
harlan
said
a
minute
ago
pointed
out
that
it's
almost
impossible
to
determine
where
the
coast
was
in
1845
because
in
--
prior
to
--
along
in
the
middle
50's
there
was
no
maps
and
even
up
until
the
present
time
that
parts
of
the
beach
have
never
been
exactly
charted
and
that's
why
--
let
me
explain
right
in
there.
that's
why
that
the
matter
was
left
to
this
court
as
stated
in
the
california
case
rather
in
congress
try
to
put
it
in
there.
you
remembered
one
time
in
the
hearings
is
brought
out
in
the
california
case
that
the
attorney
general
brought
in
and
thought
they
would
attach
a
map
to
the
act
and
this
would
settle
everything.
will
it
create
such
a
few
or
that
it
--
it
will
soon
drop
out
and
the
mapped
part
was
not
there
anymore
at
all.
now,
i
want
to
go
to
--
back
to
the
law
gentlemen.
regardless
of
which
the
governments
hurts
or
helps,
i
think
mr.
brownlee's
arguments
in
our
brief
clearly
shows
submerged
lands
act
contains
only
one
baseline
and
one
coastline
and
that's
our
contention
here
and
i
don't
think
it
was
quite
brought
out
enough
in
our
appendix.
we
have
stipulated
as
far
as
the
facts
are
concerned.
we
don't
stipulate
to
force
foreign
law
because
it
wouldn't
be
binding
on
this
court
that
there
were
no
artificial
harbor-works
or
other
structures
existing
in
the
gulf
and
in
texas
in
1845
but
the
most
important
one
is
here
and
that
is
the
jetties
at
sabine,
that's
where
--locally,
we
pronounced
it
sabine
and
galveston
harbor,
our
permanent
harbor-works
constituting
an
integral
part
of
our
harbor
system
within
the
meaning
of
article
8
of
the
convention
of
the
territorial
sea
and
taking
a
contiguous
zone
and
that
is
as
far
as
i
can
see
is
there
is
no
fact
question
gentlemen.
there
is
no
fact
question
involved.
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
yes
sir.
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
no
sir.
my
understanding
to
it
--
what
--
that
was
the
government's
contention.
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
as
i
understand
what
you
asked
sir
was
that
you
said
that
the
treaty
as
it
was
when
it
was
signed
by
the
president
in
1961
would
be
as
the
treaty
was
at
that
particular
time.
in
my
understanding
of
the
treaty
is
that
--
in
my
understanding
with
the
hold
of
this
court
is
that
if
there's
any
additional
harbor-works
are
built
that
it
extends
the
coastline
out
to
where
that
was.
that's
my
understanding
of
it.
i
may
be
wrong.
they
did
not
--
they
--
let
me
say
that
this
is
in
the
california
case
your
honor.
is
in
that
case
95
or
99%
of
the
argument
was
over
where
this
islands
out
there
where
you
could
draw
a
line
around
these
islands
out
there
and
include
all
of
that
in
the
inland
waters.
and
that
--
and
only
--
is
only
about
two
sentences
in
the
california
case
with
concern
to
this
case
and
that's
my
understanding
of
it.
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
yes
sir.
that's
--
in
other
words,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
those
were
not
built
with
the
state
of
texas.
they
were
built
by
the
federal
government
but
that's
--
in
other
words,
as
i
understand
this,
the
majority
of
this
court
when
erode
on
it,
it
was
--
one
of
the
efforts
was
to
fix
the
treaty
to
be
the
same
law
that
you
would
have
--
i
will
--
they
would
be
the
same
as
i
understand
it.
and
that
is
the
law
because
as
i
understand,
the
treaty
says
that
the
inland
waters
shall
be
the
outer
most
part
of
those
and
it
was
the
desire
of
this
court
to
make
one
uniform
law
which
would
follow
the
treaty.
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
yes
sir.
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
let
me
put
that
that
we
--
this
is
covered
part
of
the
stipulation.
there
is
a
part
in
the
treaty
that
says
it
becomes
unreasonable
than
you
disregard
it.
now,
i
didn't
want
to
go
into
that
because
we
had
stipulated
on
this
particular
ones
that
we
have
in
front
of
us
and
that
is
in
the
treaty
that
it
becomes
now
--
and
there's
no
doubt
in
my
mind
i
think
the
court
intended
to
follow
that
rule
and
that
rule
is
what
this
court
laid
down
and
this
court
had
skid
away
from
controversy
throughout
the
california.
if
california
extended
their
jetties
out
to
far
to
make
it
unreasonable
then
under
the
treaty
--
and
then
you
followed
it.
this
court
follows
a
treaty,
therefore
it
would
not
be
included.
that's
my
answer
sir.
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
first,
the
--
let
me
say
this
that
the
government's
chief
witness
and
advisor
in
the
california
case,
mr.
aaron
l.
shalowitz,
one
of
the
leading
experts
in
sea
and
shore
boundaries
while
he
was
in
florida
by
the
coast
and
geodetic
survey,
he
wrote
a
book
and
has
always
desired
when
you're
arguing
if
the
other
fellow
write
a
book.
he's
written
a
book
here
and
as
put
out
by
the
united
states
department
of
commerce
post
geodetic
survey.
and
if
the
court
would
bear
with
me
just
a
moment,
i
would
like
to
just
to
turn
to
page
167
and
the
part
--
and
this
book
was
put
out
in
order
to
be
--
the
federal
agencies
might
be
able
to
interpret.
this
is
the
interpretation
of
the
submerged
lands
act
they
put
out
in
order
so
they
might
have
some
guideline.
i
begin
reading
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
reading
that
as
a
whole
together
with
the
discussions
however
it
seems
reasonable
to
assume
that
what
the
congress
wished
to
preserve
for
the
states
was
a
concept
of
distance,
fixed
as
of
the
date
of
admission,
three
miles
or
six
miles
and
so
forth
rather
than
the
concept
of
a
fixed
line
in
the
water.
under
this
interpretation,
the
historic
distance
would
be
applied
to
the
present
coastline
to
fix
out
a
boundary
of
the
state.
and
i
drop
on
down
--
he's
got
just
a
little
bit
more.
if
this
the
--
the
submerged
lands
act
is
encored
with
the
common
law
rule
which
is
a
federal
rule
that
where
the
sea
is
a
boundary,
the
doctrine
of
erosion
and
accretion
is
normally
applicable
and
the
boundary
shifts
with
the
change.
and
if
you
bear
with
me
just
a
moment,
i
won't
to
read
one
more
sentence.
from
the
practical
point
of
view,
the
sea
or
present
coastline
is
a
logical
solution
or
it
would
be
exceeded
difficult
if
not
impossible
task
to
determine
the
line
of
ordinary
low
water
mark
in
a
distant
past
talking
about
the
past
years.
act
--
that
surveys
of
our
coast
did
not
begin
to
come
available
until
the
middle
of
the
19th
century
and
in
mini-sections
of
low
waterline
is
never
actually
been
surveyed.
that
i
think
is
this
man,
as
far
as
i
can
see
is
a
well-reasoned
book
and
not
just
because
it
was
but
it
--
he
has
done
a
tremendous
job.
now,
i
want
to
pass
another
question
and
that
is
that
the
government
in
this
case
took
the
exact
opposite
view
in
the
california
case
and
in
that
case,
of
course
this
court
found
against
him.
and
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
gave
his
interpretations
exactly
in
the
final
brief
in
the
california
case
and
i
want
to
quote
from
it
since
it's
--
we
feel
directly
in
point,
"we
now
concede
that
the
submerged
lands
act
by
making
a
grant
measure
from
the
coastline
in
existence
the
day
of
the
act
has
given
the
state
the
benefit
of
artificial
works
in
existence
at
that
time".
further
--
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
oh,
at
the
time
of
the
time
the
act
was
passed,
1953.
now,
your
honors,
so
when
it
was
viewed,
you
all
came
along
--
the
court
came
along
with
--
and
when
you
adopted
the
treaty,
well,
the
last
thing
that
it
took
till
'53
and
there's
no
dispute
that
these
--
i
mean,
that's
what
we
stipulated.
there's
no
dispute
that
our
harbor-works
were
there
in
'53.
i'd
like
to
read
just
one
more
sentence
that
i'd
add
what
congress
intended
this
definition
to
embrace
the
same
shoreline,
an
outer
limit
of
the
inland
waters
as
were
then
recognized
for
the
purpose
of
international
law,
those
were
the
active
shore
where
the
natural
or
artificial,
that's
footnote
16,
and
other
outer
limits
of
inland
water
whether
natural
or
artificially
enclosed.
of
course
that's
all
cited
in
our
brief
your
honor.
now
then,
the
solicitor's
brief
on
page
16
makes
a
further
concession
that
the
interpretation
sought
here
by
the
government
may
be
incorrect
and
already
foreclosed
by
the
basic
opinion
of
the
case.
and
what
we've
--
what
we
--
what
we're
working
with
here
this
morning
is
what
is
in
the
brief.
some
of
the
things
that
were
said
here
this
morning,
we
were
taken
a
little
bit
by
surprise,
but
we're
going
to
define
or
argue
the
best
that
we
can
to
what
we
--
what
is
in
the
brief.
i
start
here,
it
says
the
reading,
and
that's
on
page
16,
the
reading
of
the
submerged
lands
act
just
suggested
is
not
the
only
permissible
one.
i
want
to
show
you
the
government
says
that
you
can
interpret
it
either
way.
the
purpose
of
congress
in
granting
the
gulf
states
the
submerged
land
within
their
boundaries
as
they
existed,
that's
in
quotation,
when
the
state
was
admitted
to
the
union
may
well
have
been
to
give
each
such
state
not
the
particular
area
what
--
that
it
claimed
at
the
time
but
the
area
it
would
today
enjoy
if
its
historic
boundary
had
been
effective
against
the
claims
of
the
united
states
held
to
be
paramount
in
united
states
versus
texas.
there's
a
support
for
this
view
in
the
court's
first
opinion
in
the
present
case.
and
we
feel
like
that
in
closing,
we
feel
like
that
that
is
exactly
what
we
have
here.
i
want
to
say
in
one
of
the
footnotes
here,
you'll
find
that
--
and
i
believe
co-counsel
mentioned
a
minute
ago,
but
i'm
afraid
maybe
the
court,
some
of
you
didn't
hear
it.
mr.
justice,
i
will
comment
attorney
general
clark
at
that
time
when
he
filed
his
original
case.
that's
about
taking
in
new
harbors.
it
was
a
great
out
draft
about
the
matter
and
in
his
brief
in
the
footnote,
we
have
it
in
our
brief
here,
he
said
we
do
not
and
do
not
in
--
at
any
time
intend
to
take
the
harbor-work,
claim
them
to
the
united
states.
that
was
in
his
footnote
there
and
that's
the
reason
why
when
you
go
in
to
the
reading
of
the
congressional
journal
and
there
are
hearings
you
don't
find
a
lot
to
talk
about
it
because
the
government
had
no
time
intended
the
--
claimed
it.
not
until
we
got
this
particular
complaint
a
few
months
ago
that
we
know
that
the
government
at
any
time
intended
to
because
what
you
have
here
is
you
have
a
very
narrow
issue
like
--
as
i
understand
the
government's
case,
they
say
we
want
to
come
back
and
we
want
to
start
your
baseline
or
your
coastline,
it
means
one
thing
to
texas.
and
california,
louisiana,
your
coastline
means
something
else.
we
feel
like
that
the
act
only
contained
one
definition
of
coastline
and
one
definition
only
and
is
applicable
to
both
of
the
states.
now,
in
closing,
gentlemen,
i
want
to
read
to
you
just
a
moment
a
little
bit
more
and
i'll
be
through.
i'll
go
to
page
32
and
i'll
discuss
it,
but
i
want
it
first
so
i'll
be
sure
that
i
won't
get
my
language
boiled
up.
i
don't
want
to
stay
with
it.
mr.
crawford
c.
martin
of
our
brief,
sir.
that
is
the
original
decree
of
this
--
in
this
case,
this
is
--
i
believe
have
been
--
brought
out
a
lot
of
rule
but
i
want
to
make
--
they'll
be
sure
about
it
because
this
is
i
think
is
important.
decree
in
this
case
has
awarded
texas
title
to
the
submerged
lands
seaward
from
its
present
coastline
including
the
harbor-works
and
this
--
go
into
the
act.
the
act
says,
coastline
--
and
in
the
decree,
the
decree
that
this
court
entered
said
the
coastline
means
a
line
of
ordinary
low
water
along
that
portion
of
the
coast
which
is
in
direct
contact
to
the
open
sea
and
the
line
marking
the
seaward
limits
of
inland
water.
as
against
the
united
states,
the
defendant
states
are
respectfully
entitled
to
all
lands,
minerals,
and
other
natural
resources
underlying
the
mex
--
the
gulf
of
mexico.
i
didn't
just
say
louisiana.
i'm
talking
about
the
gulf
of
mexico.
this
is
your
decree,
entering
seaward
from
their
coastline
for
a
distance
of
three
leagues
in
the
case
of
texas
in
florida
and
three
geographic
miles
in
the
case
of
louisiana,
mississippi
and
alabama,
and
the
united
states
is
not
entitled
as
against
any
such
state
to
any
interest
in
such
lands,
minerals
or
resources
with
exceptions
provided
under
section
5,
which
is
not
applicable.
now
that's
--
that
is
43
u.s.c.
1313.
when
this
code
--
when
this
decree
was
entered
in
december
the
12th,
1960,
the
term
coastline,
i
call
your
attention,
that
the
term
coastline
had
already
been
defined
in
a
gulf
so
far
as
i
concede.
i
think
it
was
certain
there
united
states
recognized
as
early
in
their
brief
show,
as
early
as
1930.
they
recognized
that
the
inland
waters
included
the
harbor-works.
i
agree
with
you
that
it
was
in
fact
in
1836
because
it
was
of
no
concern
at
that
time.
but
in
1930,
this
nation
began
and
i
want
to
say
that
the
treaty
that
was
entered
into
in
1958
ordinary
thing
in
the
world
but
codifying,
i
think
the
government
was
(inaudible)
read
this
was
not
anything
would
work
but
codifying
what
the
rule
already
was.
and
in
that
debate
over
there
on
adopting
the
treaty,
since
this
is
footnoted
in
our
brief,
when
it
was
adopted,
i
believe,
"no
way".
they
said,
"no,
no,
let's
put
the
word
"may'
in
there"
and
the
french
came
back
and
said,
(inaudible)
came
back
and
said,
"no
sir,
we
will
leave
the
word
"shall'
in
there
and
that
is
in
the
treaty,
shall
be,
include
the
harbor-works".
now,
that's
our
position
in
the
matter.
gentlemen,
we
feel
that
the
1958
rule
had
been
further
confirmed
by
this
treaty
and
your
adoptions
of
the
treaty
as
your
rule.
and
therefore
the
case
as
far
as
texas
is
concerned
that
there'd
only
be
one
coastline
and
that
the
congress
didn't
intend
two
coastlines,
it'd
be
one
coastline
and
it
would
be
applicable
to
all
the
states.
unless
there's
further
question,
that
concludes
our
presentation
to
it.
