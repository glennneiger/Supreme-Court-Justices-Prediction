mr.
victor
a.
sachse
may
it
please
the
court.
we
thank
the
united
states
court
permitting
us
to
have
a
few
minutes
of
its
time.
our
purpose
in
being
here
this
morning
is
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
that
louisiana
has
filed
a
motion
for
a
supplemental
decree
number
two
in
an
effort
to
have
recognized
the
coastline
of
louisiana.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
mr.
louis
claiborne
have
informed
us
that
they
would
be
ready
to
respond
to
our
motion
by
december
1st
which
the
time
is
agreeable
to
us.
when
that
motion
is
before
the
court,
arguments
that
really
are
germane
to
the
louisiana
situation
will
be
presented.
we
expect
to
show
that
the
coastline
of
louisiana
is
in
the
water,
at
the
outer
limit
of
inland
waters
that
this
line
has
been
designated
and
defined
by
duly
authorized
agencies
of
the
federal
government,
accepted
and
approved
by
louisiana
historically,
economically
and
necessarily
established
for
the
benefit
of
the
united
states
as
a
nation
and
the
state
of
louisiana
as
a
part
of
the
nation.
we
are
concerned
not
with
the
narrow
issue
between
texas
and
the
united
states
in
this
matter
where
they
talk
about
a
harbor-work
or
a
jetty.
but
we
are
concerned
that
the
language
used
may
somehow
impinge
upon
the
argument
as
between
louisiana
and
the
united
states
without
it
being
noted
as
such.
for
example,
arguments
relating
to
shore,
arguments
relating
to
the
land
and
nothing
to
do
with
the
louisiana
situation,
the
submerged
lands
act
sets
a
definition
of
coastline.
the
act
of
admission
of
louisiana
into
the
union
deals
with
coastline.
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
california
case
an
essential
distinction
between
our
situation
and
the
california
situation
or
the
texas
situation
when
justice
harlan
for
the
court
referred
to
the
waters
of
louisiana
that
are
not
truly
navigable.
and
we
are
anxious
not
to
have
these
issues
overlooked
or
somehow
or
another
confused
by
argument
of
counsel
who
are
not
concerned
with
that
issue
at
this
present
time.
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
when
this
litigation
commenced,
louisiana
was
the
only
state
before
the
court.
and
after
we
had
our
first
argument
in
april
of
1957,
the
court
received
the
brief
from
texas
in
having
res
--
which
was
not
a
party
to
the
case
and
having
received
the
brief
from
texas,
the
court
then
barely
said
as
we
point
out
in
our
motion
that
the
issues
in
this
litigation
are
so
related
to
the
possible
interest
of
texas
and
other
states
situated
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
in
the
subject
matter
of
this
suit
that
a
just,
orderly
and
effective
determination
of
such
issues
requires
that
they'd
be
adjudicated
in
a
proceeding
in
which
all
the
interested
parties
are
before
the
court
and
the
court
then
invited
the
other
states
into
the
action.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
yes.
yes,
you
are
right
sir.
you
are
absolutely
right.
and
when
you
first
invited
the
other
states
in
and
mississippi
and
alabama
came
but
not
florida
and
texas.
then
you
issued
an
order
that
florida
and
texas
be
made
parties
so
that
everyone
could
be
heard
at
one
time
and
so
that
the
disposition
of
the
issues
as
to
one
state
would
not
inadvertently
affect
another.
we
think
that
the
situation
is
here
again
when
all
the
states
concerned
in
the
gulf
coast
ought
to
be
before
the
court
before
any
decision
is
made.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
we
are
asking
rather
justice
harlan
that
no
disposition
of
the
matter
be
made
until
we
can
complete
the
pleadings
with
the
united
states
on
our
motion
for
a
second
decree
and
be
heard
on
the
completed
pleadings
in
the
issues
between
the
united
states
and
louisiana
which
involved
the
coastline
--
which
involve
the
coastline
more
seriously
than
anywhere
else
in
the
united
states
because
(inaudible)
area
is
different
from
the
rest
of
the
union
and
the
whole
matter
should
be
before
the
court
before
decisions
that
can
affect
other
states
are
made
as
we
see
it.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
(inaudible)
country,
you
see
the
mississippi
river
has
from
time
to
time
been
in
different
places
--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
--
on
the
coast.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
right
and
--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
--
our
country
is
different
from
other
countries.
our
coastline
is
in
the
water.
it
is
at
the
outer
limit
of
inland
waters.
it
is
not
inevitably
measured
simply
from
land
or
simply
from
shore.
these
are
not
terms
suitable
to
the
geography
or
the
history
of
louisiana
or
as
embraced
in
our
active
admission
or
in
the
submerged
lands
act
as
it
relates
to
louisiana.
these
issues
are
not
before
the
court
now
but
we
think
that
all
issues
concerning
the
coastline
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
should
be
before
the
court
before
any
decisions
are
made.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
yes.
we
filed
such
a
motion
justice
harlan.
we
had
expected
the
government
to
do
so
but
the
government
did
not
and
we
decided
we
shouldn't
wait
longer
and
we
did
it
ourselves.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
as
i
say,
mr.
cox
called
us
and
said
that
he
would
like
until
the
1st
of
december
to
reply.
we
agreed.
mr.
claiborne
had
said
that
suits
him
also
and
then
after
they
plead
and
they
tell
me
that
it
would
be
an
answer
and
a
cross-claim,
further
pleadings
from
louisiana
may
be
necessary.
at
any
rate,
then
and
only
then
were
all
of
the
issues
of
the
coastline
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
properly
be
before
the
court.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
yes.
this
is
right
justice
harlan.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
what
we
said
justice
fortas
was
that
if
this
could
somehow
be
confined
to
the
narrow
issue
of
the
jetties
with
respect
--
between
texas
and
the
united
states,
louisiana
was
not
concerned.
but
if
somehow
the
issues
were
to
be
brought
in
the
consideration
of
their
case
that
then
the
whole
matter
should
be
postponed,
yes,
we
did
file
that
in
a
written
motion.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
you
heard
correctly
sir.
when
we
filed
our
motion,
the
brief
for
the
state
of
texas
has
not
been
filed.
at
least
we
did
not
have
it
and
we
said
so
in
our
motion.
now
we
have
it.
we
see
the
argument
about
a
uniform
coastline.
we
recognize
that
texas
is
considering
uniformity
with
respect
to
time.
but
the
argument
is
not
so
limited
as
it
is
expressed
in
the
brief.
they
speak
of
uniformity
of
baseline,
uniformity
of
coastline
and
the
government
this
morning
speaks
of
measuring
from
land
and
from
shore.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
we
found
nothing
since.
no
sir.
but
i
think
that
the
scope
of
our
motion
covers
the
present
situation.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
the
decision
could
be
so
limited
justice
white
that
it
would
not
affect
us
at
all.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
well,
i
really
didn't
want
to
having
argued
the
louisiana
coastline
case
now.
what
i
wanted
to
say
was
that
there
are
issues
--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
well,
i
think
we
do
sir
in
our
motion
but
i
will
say
it
this
way.
it
would
be
a
mistake,
a
grievous
mistake
so
far
as
louisiana
is
concerned
to
discuss
measuring
the
boundary
as
three
miles
from
land
or
three
miles
from
shore
or
three
leagues
from
land
or
three
leagues
from
shore.
it
would
be
a
serious
mistake
as
to
louisiana
to
discuss
the
matter
of
a
uniform
coastline
around
the
united
states
because
the
coastline
has
to
take
into
consideration
geographic
and
other
conditions
which
vary
from
place
to
place.
these
are
the
things
which
concern
us.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
we
ask
and
we
want
you
to.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
of
course
and
we
think
it
favors
us
and
we
think
that
we're
able
to
show
that
to
the
court
when
we
argue
though
of
course
i
expect
united
states
to
present
different
views.
but
at
any
rate,
we'd
like
the
court
to
have
these
views
before
a
decision
--
a
broad
decision
is
rendered
in
this
matter.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
no
sir,
i
think
not.
it
--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
we
didn't
argue
about
where
our
coastline
was
and
this
court
carefully
said
that
it
was
making
no
determination
as
to
the
coastline
that
you're
only
saying
that
the
measure
from
our
coastline
would
be
three
miles
and
not
three
leagues
and
you
reserve
for
a
future
time
the
matter
of
determination
of
the
coastline.
this
is
what
our
second
--
our
motion
for
a
second
supplemental
decree
will
present.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
yes
sir.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
may
it
please
the
court.
we
thank
the
united
states
court
permitting
us
to
have
a
few
minutes
of
its
time.
our
purpose
in
being
here
this
morning
is
to
bring
to
the
court's

that
louisiana
has
filed
a
motion
for
a

number

mr.

to
respond
to

submerged

act
sets
a
definition
of

the
act
of
admission
of
louisiana
into
the
union
deals
with
coastline.
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
california
case
an
essential
distinction
between
our
situation
and
the
california
situation
or
the
texas
situation
when
justice
harlan
for
the

referred
to

i
would
like
to

that
when
this

louisiana
was
the
only

before

and
after

mr.
victor
a.
sachse
yes.
yes,
you
are
right
sir.
you
are
absolutely
right.
and
when
you
first
invited
the
other
states
in
and
mississippi
and
alabama
came
but
not
florida
and
texas.
then
you
issued
an
order
that
florida
and
texas
be
made
parties
so
that
everyone
could
be
heard
at
one
time
and
so
that
the

of
the

would

we
think
that
the

is
here
again
when
all
the

ought
to

mr.
victor
a.
sachse
(inaudible)
country,
you
see
the
mississippi
river
has
from
time
to
time
been
in
different
places
--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
--
on
the
coast.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
right
and
--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
--
our
country
is
different
from
other
countries.
our
coastline
is
in
the
water.
it
is
at
the
outer
limit
of

it

that
all

the

in
the
gulf
of

should
be

the
court
before
any

mr.

a.
sachse
yes.
we
filed
such
a

justice
harlan.
we
had
expected
the
government
to
do
so
but
the
government
did
not
and
we
decided
we
shouldn't

we

we

mr.
victor
a.
sachse
you
heard
correctly
sir.
when
we
filed
our
motion,
the
brief
for
the
state
of
texas
has
not
been
filed.
at
least
we
did
not
have
it
and
we
said
so
in
our
motion.
now
we
have
it.
we
see
the
argument
about
a
uniform
coastline.
we
recognize
that
texas
is
considering
uniformity
with
respect
to
time.
but
the
argument
is
not
so
limited
as
it
is
expressed
in
the

they
speak
of

situation.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
the
decision
could
be
so
limited
justice
white
that
it
would
not
affect
us
at
all.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
well,
i
really
didn't
want
to
having
argued
the
louisiana
coastline
case
now.
what
i
wanted
to
say
was
that
there
are
issues
--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
well,
i
think
we
do
sir
in
our
motion
but
i
will
say
it
this
way.
it
would
be
a
mistake,
a
grievous
mistake
so
far
as
louisiana
is
concerned
to
discuss
measuring
the
boundary
as
three
miles
from
land
or
three
miles
from
shore
or
three
leagues
from
land
or
three
leagues
from
shore.
it
would
be
a
serious
mistake
as
to
louisiana
to
discuss
the
matter
of
a
uniform
coastline
around
the
united
states
because
the
coastline
has
to
take
into
consideration
geographic
and
other
conditions
which
vary
from
place
to
place.
these
are
the
things
which
concern
us.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
we
ask
and
we
want
you
to.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
of
course
and
we
think
it
favors
us
and
we
think
that
we're
able
to
show
that
to
the
court
when
we
argue
though
of
course
i
expect
united
states
to
present
different
views.
but
at
any
rate,
we'd
like
the
court
to
have
these
views
before
a
decision
--
a
broad
decision
is
rendered
in
this
matter.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
no
sir,
i
think
not.
it
--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
we
didn't
argue
about
where
our
coastline
was
and
this
court
carefully
said
that
it
was
making
no
determination
as
to
the
coastline
that
you're
only
saying
that
the
measure
from
our
coastline
would
be
three
miles
and
not
three
leagues
and
you
reserve
for
a
future
time
the
matter
of
determination
of
the
coastline.
this
is
what
our
second
--
our
motion
for
a
second
supplemental
decree
will
present.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
yes
sir.
thank
you
your
honors.
