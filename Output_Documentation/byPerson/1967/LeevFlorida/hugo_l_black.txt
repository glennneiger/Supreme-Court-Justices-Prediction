black
i
don't
believe
who
have
heard
and
any
mentioned
here,
what
worthy
his
message
was
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
trying
to
see
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
was
a
lottery
place,
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
see
with
reference
to
this
neighborly
business
of
lottery?
justice
hugo
l.
black
these
officers
dare
to
get.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
was
this
neighborly
business
of
this
lottery
business
which
are
the
violation
most
of
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
they
were
invading
his
privacy
about,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
about
anything
with
lottery?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
about
anything
with
breaking
the
law
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
what
they
got,
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
about
violating
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
this
was
his
residence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
you
as
having
lottery
in
his
residence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
talking
on
the
telephone
about
the
lotteries.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
receiving
messages
about
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
his
privacy
about
violating
the
law
that
officers
will
have
to
invade,
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
it's
all
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
you,
you
have
a
very
simple
proposition
which
is
either
right
or
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
have
is
party
lines
installed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
these
people
may
have
rented
this
for
a
home
or
they
may
have
rented
it
for
gambling
but
that's
not
the
theory.
they
had
it.
they
had
a
party
line,
they
knew,
the
court
knew
that
they
had
a
party
line.
these
other
people
got
on
as
party
lines
and
that's
where
you
draw
your
line
as
i
understand
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
if
they
are
simply
on
party
line
they've
got
the
same
right
to
use
it
as
anybody
else
that's
not
a
tap.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
say
is
that
stops
right
there
that
they
put
any
kind
of
device
that
do
anything
of
that
kind
that
it
would
be
illegal,
that's
my
understanding
of
what
your
claiming
and
that
you
are
putting
it
all
on
to
this
that
they
will
own
the
party
line
right
through
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
claim
rightfully?
you
maybe
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
your
claim
that
since
that
is
the
case,
that
the
constitution
shouldn't
protect
the
gentlemen
who
is
running
the
lottery.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
this
man
communicating
with
his
lawyer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
guess
what
you're
really
claiming
is
the
aid
or
opportunity
of
party
line
listen
to
his
neighbors
accusation
when
he
has
a
party
line
that
the
constitution
doesn't
step
in
that
make
him
a
criminal
if
he
exposes
what
he
heard
on
his
party
line.
