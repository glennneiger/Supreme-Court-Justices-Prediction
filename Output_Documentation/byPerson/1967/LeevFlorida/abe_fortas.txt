justice
abe
fortas
well,
suppose
you
could
call
sort
of
neighborly
interception.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
isn't
that
--
does
it
make
any
difference
that
the
police
here
rented
the
house
and
installed
the
telephone
in
the
house
on
this
private
line
for
the
purpose
of
eavesdropping,
is
that
make
any
difference
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
any
legal
matter?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
saying
is
that
this
is
not
the
same
as
if
the
--
a
neighbor
who
is
on
the
party
line
in
regular
course
of
life
picked
his
party
line
and
happen
over
hear
the
conversation
and
then
reported
it
to
the
police,
is
that
your
point?
justice
abe
fortas
and
also
police
--
the
police
here
rented
the
house,
had
the
phone
installed
on
the
party
line
for
the
purpose
of
conducting
what
you
say
was
a
search.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
attorney
general,
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
in
this
community
where
i
gather
people
i
have
party
line
telephones
let
us
suppose
that
a
client
telephones
his
lawyer,
client
telephones
his
lawyer.
now
the
client
can
waive
the
lawyer-client
privilege,
does
the
notice
upon
which
you're
relying
here,
the
notice
that
the
publicity
of
the
use
of
the
party
line
operate
to
waive
the
attorney-client
privilege
with
respect
to
the
matter
that
the
client
has
communicated
to
the
attorney?
justice
abe
fortas
well
it's
kind
of
related
to
the
proposition
which
you
are
stating.
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
use
of
a
party
line
telephone
waives
any
right
of
the
user
to
insist
upon
the
confidentiality
of
the
communication.
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
--
would
you
extend
that
to
the
case
of
a
client
communicating
with
his
lawyer?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
this
hasn't
answered
the
question
whether
this
man
was
communicating
with
his
lawyer
or
not.
you
still
have
question
of
principle
here,
don't
you
mr.
attorney
general?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
to
whether
a
person
who
uses
a
party
line
telephone
surrenders
whole
claim
to
confidentiality.
you
also
have
the
question
here
as
to
whether
the
police
were
conducting
a
search
and
deliberately
adopted
this
device
to
conduct
the
warrantless
search.
those
are
the
questions
in
your
case.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
do
you
think
that
it's
only
with
respect
to
fourth
amendment
right
that
the
use
of
a
party
line
constitutes
a
waiver
or
surrender?
