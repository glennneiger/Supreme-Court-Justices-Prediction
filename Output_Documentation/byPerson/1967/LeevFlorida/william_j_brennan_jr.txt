you
say
as

as
i
understand
it,
they
didn't
have
to
take
the
receiver

because
they
made
an
actual
tap
on

connected

is
that
it?
justice
william

but
i
gather
the
tap,
it
was
a
tap
even
though
it
was
made
under
wires
in
the
officer's
house.

well,
how

difficult
an

justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
as
i
understand
it,
they
put
in
an
ordinary
party

justice
william

they
cannot
be
detected
because
they
don't
click
on

that

could

know
that
someone
else
was

out
with

him
only
a

does
the

show
that

that
no,
it

not
the

i
thought

was

if

overhearing

doesn't
it?

don't

justice
william

well,
your

really
i
gather
can
stand
to
this
that
he
took
all
of
the
risks
of
being
overheard
and
that
ought
to
dispose
both
of
his
605
argument
and
of
his

argument.
justice

how
many
issues
to
be
exact?
justice
william

brennan,

well,
suppose
they
installed
in
police
headquarters
and
apparatus
like
this
which
tied
in
with
every
party
line
in
the
community
they're
on
their
own
police
headquarters
they
did
exactly
what
they
did
here,
you
think
that's
alright?

why?
how
does
that
