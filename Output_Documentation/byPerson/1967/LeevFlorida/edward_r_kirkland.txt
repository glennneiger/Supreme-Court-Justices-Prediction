mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
before
the
court
today
on
oral
argument
arising
out
of
a
conviction
in
a
state
court
of
petitioners
lee,
brashin
and
merit
in
1964.
the
defendants
were
brought
on
for
trial
before
the
trial
court
on
various
counts
of
violation
of
the
florida
lottery
laws
and
dissemination
of
raising
information
by
telephonic
methods.
the
trial
resulted
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
as
to
three
of
the
defendants
petitioners
here
and
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
take
recordings
or
wire
recordings
of
conversations
had
between
the
petitioners
lee,
brashin
and
marrette
and
others
were
introduced
at
the
trial
over
objection
of
the
counsel
for
the
defendants
below.
now,
the
procedure
used
and
i
might
address
and
say
in
this
instant,
florida
does
not
have
a
permissive
wire
tap
law
or
a
law
similar
to
the
one
apparently
just
struck
down
by
this
court
in
the
berger
case
that
new
york
has.
the
method
adopted
in
this
case
were
that
police
officers
and
deputy's
sheriff
of
orange
county
arranged
with
the
winter
park
telephone
company
to
install
a
line,
a
telephone
line
in
a
house
next
to
the
petitioner
lee's
house
and
advised
the
telephone
company
they
wanted
a
party
line,
that
is
a
line
that
was
on
the
same
cable
with
the
petitioner
lee.
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
mr.
--
the
evidence
i
believe
will
show
in
this
case
that
mr.
lee
ordered
a
private
line.
there
is
some
dispute
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
ever
advised
that
he
was
given
a
party
line
instead
of
a
private
line.
there
is
evidence
that
there
were
some
conspiracies
so
to
speak
between
the
deputy
sheriff
who
ordered
the
line
in
the
one
part
telephone
company
to
arrange
a
party
line
for
mr.
lee
so
that
they
could
then
intercept
telephonic
communications
on
that
line
and
record
them.
the
testimony
is
here
before
the
court.
i
can't
recall
exactly
what
it
was
but
i
know
that
there
were
some
evidence
that
there
was
a
cast
of
agreement
or
conspiracy
between
the
telephone
company
and
the
deputy
sheriff
to
give
mr.
lee
party
line
so
that
they
can
then
ready
how
down
the
street
which
they
did
do.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
sir.
there
is
one
witness
named
noel
i
believe
in
the
appendix
and
testified
that
he
had
advised
mr.
lee
of
that
and
i
believe
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
no,
sir.
there
was
no
finding
to
that
effect,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
sir.
this
is
judicial
license
mr.
justice
white
more
than
an
actual
factual
reading
of
the
testimony
will
show.
i
believe
the
testimony
will
show
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
sir.
but
at
the
time
that
the
original
brief
were
filed
katz
versus
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
--
had
not
been
decided.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
was
a
federal
case
versus
u.s.,
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
well,
we
are
underpinning
our
appeal
on
both
that
we're
asking
the
court
to
revisit
schwartz
versus
texas
and
to
depart
briskly
from
that
decision.
in
view
of
the
statements
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
the
pugach
case
which
for
all
intents
and
purposes
swept
away
the
rationale
of
the
schwartz
versus
texas
case.
we're
asking
the
court
to
reverse
on
both
grounds.
now,
briefly
touching
on
the
fourth
amendment
question
reiterate
once
again
defendant
lee
was
in
his
home
talking
on
the
telephone
while
police
officers
were
intercepting
and
recording
conversations
that
he
had
with
the
petitioners
brashin
and
marette
and
others.
in
the
recent
case
katz
versus
united
states,
the
--
this
court
reversed
a
conviction
based
upon
evidence
obtained
by
the
federal
officers
after
they
had
placed
an
electronic
device
on
the
top
of
a
public
telephone
booth
and
recorded
the
conversation
of
mr.
katz
and
others
concerning
the
dissemination
of
bidding
information
or
book
making.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
no,
sir.
there
was
not
a
phone
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
the
evidence
in
the
appendix
says,
states
that
the
officer
who
did
it
disconnected
two
screws
at
the
base
within
the
home
that
they
had
rented,
the
base
board
which
made
a
direct
connection
with
the
line
of
the
petitioner
lee
and
it
facilitated
the
recording
because
it
was
not
necessary
then
to
release
or
pick
up
the
receiver
which
gives
a
click
and
it
was
a
bit
sophisticated
for
me
but
apparently
this
was
in
fact
a
direct
connection
with
the
party
line.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
lee
was
the
house
that
the
petitioner.
yes,
sir.
now
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
this
is
what
the
testimony
i
believe
and
the
appendix
will
show
that
instead
of
lifting
up
to
the
phone
to
hear
the
conversation
when
it
ring
of
course
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
sir.
there
was
a
tap
to
the
extent
that
there
were
two
wires.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
that's
correct.
they
did
not
have
to
lift
up
the
phone
they
had
a
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
it
automatically
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
it
automatically
recorded.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
they
didn't
have
to.
they
have
what
they
call
automatic
actuator.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
well,
it
doesn't
in
my
view.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
a
tap
on
that
own
party
line
it
is
recording,
it
maybe
once
again
a
distraction
of
without
a
difference.
i
don't
understand.
there
is
a
--
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
the
tap
that
was
involved
was
the
use
of
this
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
at
that
stage,
no.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
it
would've
been
an
interference
or
an
interception,
it
may
not
have
been
a
tap.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
no,
not
a
tap
as
such.
picking
up
the
telephone
and
listen
to
the
conversation.
they
had
a
gadget
record
on
their
own
in
the
party
line
which
enabled
the
(inaudible).
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
that
is
a
fair
statement
of
what
actually.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
sir.
your
honor,
but
connecting
up
with
the
actual
outlets
of
the
wire
as
opposed
to
the
--
cables
are.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
that's
correct.
and
to
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
not
as
long
as
he
did
not
divulge
them.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
not
as
long
as
he
did
not
divulge
them.
the
condemnation
in
605
is
not
the
interception
but
it's
the
divulgence.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
unless
he
had
--
well,
no,
sir.
because
he
would
have
consent
then
or
he
would
give
consent
to
himself
and
605
inhibits
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
because
they
are
divulging
conversations
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
which
they're
not
participating
in
and
which
they
have
gotten
to
consent
to
interrupt
or
intercept
and
to
divulge.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
he
absolutely
would
be
violating
605
if
he
intercepted
and
transcribed
and
published
or
disseminated
this
information,
he
would
be
in
direct
violation
of
605.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
no,
605
inhibits
the
publication
of
it
not
necessarily
the
listening
to
it.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
if
he
picked
up
what
phone
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
certainly
not.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
he
would
not
have
violated
605
if
he
picked
up
his
own
phone
and
the
load
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
and
listen
to
other
conversations
and
loads
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
well,
i
live
in
a
small
community
outside
of
orlando.
there
are
no
private
lines.
i
practice
law
there
and
i'm
exposing
myself
to
the
danger
of
a
client
calling
me
up
and
say
and
i
just
killed
my
wife
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
i
agree
is
a
firmly
question
and
i'm
trying
to
give
us
suspicious
answer
perhaps.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
certainly
does.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
it
does,
certainly
because
this
partakes
then
of
a
general
warrant
or
a
search
for
evidence
as
opposed
to
a
mere
in
adverting
lifting
up
of
a
line
and
interception
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
i
certainly
believe
that
there
is
a
definite
stronger
case
made
for
this
appeal
if
in
fact
it
partakes
of
a
general
search
which
the
state
must
contend
that
concerning
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
officer
who
did
it
in
response
to
this
question
made
this
answer.
the
question
in
other
words,
it
was
something
more
than
coincidence
that
this
line
happened
to
be
a
line
on
a
party
line
with
411
manor
road
and
the
answer
i
beg
your
pardon.
the
question,
that
was
something
more
than
a
coincidence
that
the
line
that
was
installed
was
on
a
party
line
with
the
lee
house.
answer,
yes,
we
did
installed
it
for
the
fun
of
it
and
it
is
obvious
throughout
the
entire
examination
of
the
witness
that
they're
not
only
talked
the
winter
park
telephone
company
in
the
giving
mr.
lee
a
party
line
when
he
actually
ordered
a
private
line
but
also
the
arranged
with
the
winter
park
telephone
company
to
install
another
party
line
in
the
house
next
door
in
order
to
conduct
this
surveillance.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
i
believe
if
your
honor
please
that
mr.
lee
installed
his
telephone,
i
may
be
absolutely
incorrect.
it
seems
to
me
it
was
around
july
19th,
mr.
lee
was
in
the
officers
installed
their
telephone
one
week
later.
so,
it
was
a
matter
of
six
or
seven
day.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
historically,
i'm
not
sure
if
i'm
speaking
off
the
record
--
out
of
the
record,
i
hope
not
but
it
occurs
to
me
that
they
have
been
following
lee
and
observed
him
going
into
this
house
and
rented
and
immediately
contacted
the
winter
park
telephone
company
in
an
effort
to
get
a
party
line
for
lee
and
for
themselves
to
conduct
this
electronic
surveillance.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
the
messages
--
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
mr.
justice
black,
the
messages
were
all
or
generally
summed
up
in
the
appendix
and
they
dealt
with
dissemination
of
lottery
information,
the
numbers
that
had
been
bet
or
the
numbers
that
had
been
played
a
tally
sheet
that
i
believe
that
rashin
and
marret
were
allegedly
picked
people
in
the
lottery
business
and
they
would
phone
in
to
this
house
to
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
in
a
neighborly
way,
yes.
it
was
allegedly
a
lottery.
that's
what
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
lottery,
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
i
didn't
hear
the
first
part
your
honor.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
it
is
and
was.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
well,
i
assume
that
they
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
sir?
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
i
don't
know.
they
didn't
divulge
to
me
anything
except
the
bad
part
of
the
conversations.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
that's
what
they
got.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
your
honor
and
this
is
the
only
evidence
i
believe
in
the
case
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
this
was
his
residence.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
no,
sir.
he
was
--
he
was
published
--
he
was
listening
and
to
and
talking
on
the
telephone
from
his
residence.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
about
the
number
that
had
fallen,
the
coupon
lottery
number
that
had
fallen
and
on
one
or
two
occasions
i
believe
the
appendix
will
show
where
there
was
a
rundown
of
the
number
of
wagers,
the
dollar
amounts
and
the
numbers
that
were
wager.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
well,
yes
sir
and
if
they
had
known
that
he'd
been
violating
the
law
assuming
they
would've
got
the
search
warrant
which
they
should've
as
they
did
in
the
osborne
case
and
i
wouldn't
be
here
at
this
time
if
they
had
followed
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
it's
all
about
his
privacy
in
violating
the
law
that
was
interrupted,
yes
sir
and
must
be
candid.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
i
would
certainly
hope
not
mr.
justice
marshall
and
i
would
hope
that
i
would
have
some
privilege
communication
rights
at
least
under
the
attorney-client
relationship.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
that
would
not
be
used.
now,
as
one
thing
to
hear
it,
it's
another
thing
to
disseminate
it
or
to
publish
it
and
even
yet
another
thing
to
use
it
as
the
sole
incriminating
evidence
in
a
trial.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
it's
not
clear
from
the
evidence
but
when
you
say
four-party
line
and
i
believe
there
were
two
persons
on
it
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
no,
as
a
matter
of
fact
i'm
incorrect.
there
were
others
on
the
line
and
because
we
attempted
to
get
their
conversations
and
the
state
law
does
not
permit
us
to
have
this
discovery
but
there
are
other
people
on
the
line
whose
conversation
were
likewise
recorded
because
this
infirming
machine
could
not
differentiate
between
intrastate,
interstate,
party
line
calls
or
anything
anytime
the
wire
was
picked
up
in
the
lee
house
or
incoming
call
was
made
into
the
lee
house,
the
electronic
currents
actuated
this
gadget
and
started
recording
all
of
the
conversation
that
took
place.
so,
there
were
others
on
there
whose
privacy
were
being
invaded
and
were
not
violating
law
apparently.
i'll
reserve
my
few
comments
for
rebuttal.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
very
briefly
touching
on
two
points
in
answer
to
justice
white's
inquiry
about
the
retroactivity
of
katz.
i
don't
think
this
is
that
violent
because
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
make
katz
retroactive
as
to
trial
to
this
cause
and
the
grounds
on
which
we
are
relying
are
preceded
--
the
trial
preceded
katz,
the
grounds
on
which
we
were
relying
are
similar
to
those
raised
in
katz
and
would
be
merely
reaffirming
katz
if
this
court
applied
the
rationale
of
katz
and
not
making
it
prospective
in
application
as
opposed
to
retroactive.
the
point
that
the
general
here
has
completely
overlooked
is
that
there
are
three
appellants.
the
record
indicates
that
brashin
and
marette
had
party
--
had
private
lines
and
there
was
no
evidence
that
they
knew
mr.
lee
was
on
a
party
line.
so
certainly,
when
they
picked
up
the
phone
and
dialed
mr.
lee,
whatever
their
motive
was,
they
did
not
exposed
themselves
to
any
recordation,
interception
or
interference
and
the
evidence
in
the
case
that
convicted
brashin
and
marette
was
nothing
more
than
the
recorded
conversations
and
i
think
this
answered
mr.
justice
fortas'
question
that
the
incoming
callers
certainly
should
be
given
the
protection
and
i
think
in
this
case
the
outgoing
caller
should
be
afforded
to
protection.
since
he
has
granted
the
privileges
of
the
line
and
the
immunities,
he
certainly
should
not
have
carried
the
burdens
of
having
a
party
line.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
before
the
court
today
on
oral
argument
arising
out
of
a
conviction
in
a
state
court
of
petitioners
lee,
brashin
and
merit
in
1964.
the
defendants
were
brought
on
for
trial
before
the
trial
court
on
various
counts
of
violation
of
the
florida
lottery
laws
and
dissemination
of
raising
information
by
telephonic
methods.
the
trial
resulted
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
as
to
three
of
the
defendants
petitioners
here
and
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
take
recordings
or
wire
recordings
of
conversations
had
between
the
petitioners
lee,
brashin
and
marrette
and
others
were
introduced
at
the
trial
over
objection
of
the
counsel
for
the
defendants
below.
now,
the
procedure
used
and
i
might
address
and
say
in
this
instant,
florida
does
not
have
a
permissive
wire
tap
law
or
a
law
similar
to
the
one
apparently
just
struck
down
by
this
court
in
the
berger
case
that
new
york
has.
the
method
adopted
in
this
case
were
that
police
officers
and
deputy's
sheriff
of
orange
county
arranged
with
the
winter
park
telephone
company
to
install
a
line,
a
telephone
line
in
a
house
next
to
the
petitioner
lee's
house
and
advised
the
telephone
company
they
wanted
a
party
line,
that
is
a
line
that
was
on
the
same
cable
with
the
petitioner
lee.
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
mr.
--
the
evidence
i
believe
will
show
in
this
case
that
mr.
lee
ordered
a
private
line.
there
is
some
dispute
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
ever
advised
that
he
was
given
a
party
line
instead
of
a
private
line.
there
is
evidence
that
there
were
some
conspiracies
so
to
speak
between
the
deputy
sheriff
who
ordered
the
line
in
the
one
part
telephone
company
to
arrange
a
party
line
for
mr.
lee
so
that
they
could
then
intercept
telephonic
communications
on
that
line
and
record
them.
the
testimony
is
here
before
the
court.
i
can't
recall
exactly
what
it
was
but
i
know
that
there
were
some
evidence
that
there
was
a
cast
of
agreement
or
conspiracy
between
the
telephone
company
and
the
deputy
sheriff
to
give
mr.
lee
party
line
so
that
they
can
then
ready
how
down
the
street
which
they
did
do.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
sir.
there
is
one
witness
named
noel
i
believe
in
the
appendix
and
testified
that
he
had
advised
mr.
lee
of
that
and
i
believe
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
no,
sir.
there
was
no
finding
to
that
effect,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
sir.
this
is
judicial
license
mr.
justice
white
more
than
an
actual
factual
reading
of
the
testimony
will
show.
i
believe
the
testimony
will
show
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
sir.
but
at
the
time
that
the
original
brief
were
filed
katz
versus
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
--
had
not
been
decided.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
was
a
federal
case
versus
u.s.,
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
well,
we
are
underpinning
our
appeal
on
both
that
we're
asking
the
court
to
revisit
schwartz
versus
texas
and
to
depart
briskly
from
that
decision.
in
view
of
the
statements
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
the
pugach
case
which
for
all
intents
and
purposes
swept
away
the
rationale
of
the
schwartz
versus
texas
case.
we're
asking
the
court
to
reverse
on
both
grounds.
now,
briefly
touching
on
the
fourth
amendment
question
reiterate
once
again
defendant
lee
was
in
his
home
talking
on
the
telephone
while
police
officers
were
intercepting
and
recording
conversations
that
he
had
with
the
petitioners
brashin
and
marette
and
others.
in
the
recent
case
katz
versus
united
states,
the
--
this
court
reversed
a
conviction
based
upon
evidence
obtained
by
the
federal
officers
after
they
had
placed
an
electronic
device
on
the
top
of
a
public
telephone
booth
and
recorded
the
conversation
of
mr.
katz
and
others
concerning
the
dissemination
of
bidding
information
or
book
making.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
no,
sir.
there
was
not
a
phone
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
the
evidence
in
the
appendix
says,
states
that
the
officer
who
did
it
disconnected
two
screws
at
the
base
within
the
home
that
they
had
rented,
the
base
board
which
made
a
direct
connection
with
the
line
of
the
petitioner
lee
and
it
facilitated
the
recording
because
it
was
not
necessary
then
to
release
or
pick
up
the
receiver
which
gives
a
click
and
it
was
a
bit
sophisticated
for
me
but
apparently
this
was
in
fact
a
direct
connection
with
the
party
line.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
lee
was
the
house
that
the
petitioner.
yes,
sir.
now
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
this
is
what
the
testimony
i
believe
and
the
appendix
will
show
that
instead
of
lifting
up
to
the
phone
to
hear
the
conversation
when
it
ring
of
course
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
sir.
there
was
a
tap
to
the
extent
that
there
were
two
wires.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
that's
correct.
they
did
not
have
to
lift
up
the
phone
they
had
a
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
it
automatically
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
it
automatically
recorded.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
they
didn't
have
to.
they
have
what
they
call
automatic
actuator.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
well,
it
doesn't
in
my
view.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
a
tap
on
that
own
party
line
it
is
recording,
it
maybe
once
again
a
distraction
of
without
a
difference.
i
don't
understand.
there
is
a
--
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
the
tap
that
was
involved
was
the
use
of
this
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
at
that
stage,
no.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
it
would've
been
an
interference
or
an
interception,
it
may
not
have
been
a
tap.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
no,
not
a
tap
as
such.
picking
up
the
telephone
and
listen
to
the
conversation.
they
had
a
gadget
record
on
their
own
in
the
party
line
which
enabled
the
(inaudible).
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
that
is
a
fair
statement
of
what
actually.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
sir.
your
honor,
but
connecting
up
with
the
actual
outlets
of
the
wire
as
opposed
to
the
--
cables
are.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
that's
correct.
and
to
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
not
as
long
as
he
did
not
divulge
them.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
not
as
long
as
he
did
not
divulge
them.
the
condemnation
in
605
is
not
the
interception
but
it's
the
divulgence.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
unless
he
had
--
well,
no,
sir.
because
he
would
have
consent
then
or
he
would
give
consent
to
himself
and
605
inhibits
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
because
they
are
divulging
conversations
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
which
they're
not
participating
in
and
which
they
have
gotten
to
consent
to
interrupt
or
intercept
and
to
divulge.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
he
absolutely
would
be
violating
605
if
he
intercepted
and
transcribed
and
published
or
disseminated
this
information,
he
would
be
in
direct
violation
of
605.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
no,
605
inhibits
the
publication
of
it
not
necessarily
the
listening
to
it.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
if
he
picked
up
what
phone
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
certainly
not.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
he
would
not
have
violated
605
if
he
picked
up
his
own
phone
and
the
load
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
and
listen
to
other
conversations
and
loads
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
well,
i
live
in
a
small
community
outside
of
orlando.
there
are
no
private
lines.
i
practice
law
there
and
i'm
exposing
myself
to
the
danger
of
a
client
calling
me
up
and
say
and
i
just
killed
my
wife
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
i
agree
is
a
firmly
question
and
i'm
trying
to
give
us
suspicious
answer
perhaps.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
certainly
does.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
it
does,
certainly
because
this
partakes
then
of
a
general
warrant
or
a
search
for
evidence
as
opposed
to
a
mere
in
adverting
lifting
up
of
a
line
and
interception
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
i
certainly
believe
that
there
is
a
definite
stronger
case
made
for
this
appeal
if
in
fact
it
partakes
of
a
general
search
which
the
state
must
contend
that
concerning
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
officer
who
did
it
in
response
to
this
question
made
this
answer.
the
question
in
other
words,
it
was
something
more
than
coincidence
that
this
line
happened
to
be
a
line
on
a
party
line
with
411
manor
road
and
the
answer
i
beg
your
pardon.
the
question,
that
was
something
more
than
a
coincidence
that
the
line
that
was
installed
was
on
a
party
line
with
the
lee
house.
answer,
yes,
we
did
installed
it
for
the
fun
of
it
and
it
is
obvious
throughout
the
entire
examination
of
the
witness
that
they're
not
only
talked
the
winter
park
telephone
company
in
the
giving
mr.
lee
a
party
line
when
he
actually
ordered
a
private
line
but
also
the
arranged
with
the
winter
park
telephone
company
to
install
another
party
line
in
the
house
next
door
in
order
to
conduct
this
surveillance.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
i
believe
if
your
honor
please
that
mr.
lee
installed
his
telephone,
i
may
be
absolutely
incorrect.
it
seems
to
me
it
was
around
july
19th,
mr.
lee
was
in
the
officers
installed
their
telephone
one
week
later.
so,
it
was
a
matter
of
six
or
seven
day.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
historically,
i'm
not
sure
if
i'm
speaking
off
the
record
--
out
of
the
record,
i
hope
not
but
it
occurs
to
me
that
they
have
been
following
lee
and
observed
him
going
into
this
house
and
rented
and
immediately
contacted
the
winter
park
telephone
company
in
an
effort
to
get
a
party
line
for
lee
and
for
themselves
to
conduct
this
electronic
surveillance.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
the
messages
--
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
mr.
justice
black,
the
messages
were
all
or
generally
summed
up
in
the
appendix
and
they
dealt
with
dissemination
of
lottery
information,
the
numbers
that
had
been
bet
or
the
numbers
that
had
been
played
a
tally
sheet
that
i
believe
that
rashin
and
marret
were
allegedly
picked
people
in
the
lottery
business
and
they
would
phone
in
to
this
house
to
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
in
a
neighborly
way,
yes.
it
was
allegedly
a
lottery.
that's
what
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
lottery,
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
i
didn't
hear
the
first
part
your
honor.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
it
is
and
was.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
well,
i
assume
that
they
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
sir?
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
i
don't
know.
they
didn't
divulge
to
me
anything
except
the
bad
part
of
the
conversations.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
that's
what
they
got.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
your
honor
and
this
is
the
only
evidence
i
believe
in
the
case
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
this
was
his
residence.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
no,
sir.
he
was
--
he
was
published
--
he
was
listening
and
to
and
talking
on
the
telephone
from
his
residence.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
about
the
number
that
had
fallen,
the
coupon
lottery
number
that
had
fallen
and
on
one
or
two
occasions
i
believe
the
appendix
will
show
where
there
was
a
rundown
of
the
number
of
wagers,
the
dollar
amounts
and
the
numbers
that
were
wager.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
well,
yes
sir
and
if
they
had
known
that
he'd
been
violating
the
law
assuming
they
would've
got
the
search
warrant
which
they
should've
as
they
did
in
the
osborne
case
and
i
wouldn't
be
here
at
this
time
if
they
had
followed
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
it's
all
about
his
privacy
in
violating
the
law
that
was
interrupted,
yes
sir
and
must
be
candid.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
i
would
certainly
hope
not
mr.
justice
marshall
and
i
would
hope
that
i
would
have
some
privilege
communication
rights
at
least
under
the
attorney-client
relationship.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
that
would
not
be
used.
now,
as
one
thing
to
hear
it,
it's
another
thing
to
disseminate
it
or
to
publish
it
and
even
yet
another
thing
to
use
it
as
the
sole
incriminating
evidence
in
a
trial.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
it's
not
clear
from
the
evidence
but
when
you
say
four-party
line
and
i
believe
there
were
two
persons
on
it
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
no,
as
a
matter
of
fact
i'm
incorrect.
there
were
others
on
the
line
and
because
we
attempted
to
get
their
conversations
and
the
state
law
does
not
permit
us
to
have
this
discovery
but
there
are
other
people
on
the
line
whose
conversation
were
likewise
recorded
because
this
infirming
machine
could
not
differentiate
between
intrastate,
interstate,
party
line
calls
or
anything
anytime
the
wire
was
picked
up
in
the
lee
house
or
incoming
call
was
made
into
the
lee
house,
the
electronic
currents
actuated
this
gadget
and
started
recording
all
of
the
conversation
that
took
place.
so,
there
were
others
on
there
whose
privacy
were
being
invaded
and
were
not
violating
law
apparently.
i'll
reserve
my
few
comments
for
rebuttal.
mr.
edward
r.
kirkland
very
briefly
touching
on
two
points
in
answer
to
justice
white's
inquiry
about
the
retroactivity
of
katz.
i
don't
think
this
is
that
violent
because
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
make
katz
retroactive
as
to
trial
to
this
cause
and
the
grounds
on
which
we
are
relying
are
preceded
--
the
trial
preceded
katz,
the
grounds
on
which
we
were
relying
are
similar
to
those
raised
in
katz
and
would
be
merely
reaffirming
katz
if
this
court
applied
the
rationale
of
katz
and
not
making
it
prospective
in
application
as
opposed
to
retroactive.
the
point
that
the
general
here
has
completely
overlooked
is
that
there
are
three
appellants.
the
record
indicates
that
brashin
and
marette
had
party
--
had
private
lines
and
there
was
no
evidence
that
they
knew
mr.
lee
was
on
a
party
line.
so
certainly,
when
they
picked
up
the
phone
and
dialed
mr.
lee,
whatever
their
motive
was,
they
did
not
exposed
themselves
to
any
recordation,
interception
or
interference
and
the
evidence
in
the
case
that
convicted
brashin
and
marette
was
nothing
more
than
the
recorded
conversations
and
i
think
this
answered
mr.
justice
fortas'
question
that
the
incoming
callers
certainly
should
be
given
the
protection
and
i
think
in
this
case
the
outgoing
caller
should
be
afforded
to
protection.
since
he
has
granted
the
privileges
of
the
