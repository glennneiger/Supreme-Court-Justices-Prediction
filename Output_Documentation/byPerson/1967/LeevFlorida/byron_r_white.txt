justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
is
there
a
finding
to
that
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
the
opinion
of
the
florida
court
say
the
facts
in
this
case
show
the
defendants
requested
private
line
but
were
in
more
by
the
telephone
company
that
no
private
line
was
unavailable?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
that
a
florida
court
on
this
historical
fact
finding
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
should
differ
with
the
florida
court
on
this?
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
if
this
finding
is
really
relevant
to
the
issue
if
the
court
wants
to
file
or
believe
with
the
historical
fact
that
the
florida
properly
stated
the
question
and
i
would
certainly
be
happy
to
go
along
because
i
believe
the
very
ruling
of
the
florida
court
is
limited
to
the
statement
that
your
honor
had
just
made
or
the
finding
of
the
florida
court
that
there
was
knowledge
on
the
part
of
mr.
lee
that
he
was
getting
a
private
--
a
party
line
instead
of
a
private
line.
the
first
and
most
obvious
fact
is
that
at
no
time
did
the
police
or
the
deputy
sheriff
seek
a
search
warrant
to
obtain
the
information
which
they
subsequently
obtained
by
the
use
of
this
equipment.
now,
to
go
in
a
little
bit
more
into
the
history
of
what
happened.
once
the
defendant
lee
obtained
this
party
line,
the
police
arranged
with
the
winter
park
telephone
company
to
install
a
party
--
another
party
line
in
a
house
which
were
rendered
--
which
was
rendered
by
the
police
and
an
electronic
actuator
and
some
other
sophisticated
type
of
electronic
surveillance
equipment
was
attached
to
a
wall
outlet
in
the
house
which
permitted
the
police
to
overhear
by
headsets
and
to
record
by
equipment,
recording
equipment
all
the
conversations
that
were
either
placed
from
an
outgoing
call
or
were
received
by
incoming
calls.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
nor
has
the
state
contend
in
its
brief
and
our
position
to
this
petition
that
the
police
had
probable
cause
to
conduct
a
general
search
which
i
believe
the
state
of
florida
will
have
to
concede.
they
did
in
this
fact,
a
mere
search
for
evidence
which
of
course
has
been
condemned
by
this
court
many
times.
there
was
no
effort
whatsoever
to
obtain
a
search
warrant
to
conduct
the
search.
the
police
merely
arranged
to
have
a
party
line
installed
in
mr.
lee's
house
and
for
the
telephone
company
to
install
a
line
whereby
they
could
intercept
and
record
the
messages.
i
believe
that
the
distinction
is
there
is
one
amounts
to
no
difference
for
this
reason
mr.
justice
white
in
answer
to
your
question.
admittedly
mr.
lee,
according
to
the
findings
of
the
appellate
court
of
florida
had
knowledge
that
there
was
a
party
line
in
existence.
this
creates
then
a
double
standard
if
mr.
marette
who
called
in
from
his
private
line
and
if
mr.
brashin
who
called
in
on
their
private
line
are
protected
either
under
the
fourth
amendment
or
by
section
605
of
the
federal
communications
act
then
it
would
resolve
itself
to
an
economic
problem.
that
is
a
person
who
can
afford
a
private
line
carries
the
immunities
of
a
private
line
without
the
burdens
of
perhaps
being
eavesdropped
upon.
now,
like
this
court
has
and
of
course
counsel
is
certainly
aware
of
schwartz
versus
texas
a
case
some
years
ago
where
in
this
court
held
that
section
605
of
the
federal
communications
act
does
not
apply
in
state
court
and
we're
cognizant
of
this
case
and
i'm
satisfied
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
will
argue
this
case
very
strongly.
but
i
have
noted
in
the
recent
case
of
pugach
versus
dollinger
where
justices
of
this
court
including
the
chief
justice
have
stated
that
the
rationale
or
the
underpinnings
of
schwartz
had
been
swept
away
by
the
case
of
benanti
versus
the
united
states.
now,
in
the
pugach
case,
although
there
was
an
affirmance
of
the
lower
court,
the
issue
was
not
directly
connected
with
the
question
of
the
applicability
of
the
rule
of
exclusion
under
605
in
this
federal
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
if
your
--
if
your
client
had
just
short
of
his
own
telephone
in
his
own
house
and
made
a
connection
with
the
wires
in
order
to
record
his
own
conversations
for
his
record,
i
would
suppose
you
would
under
your
theory
argue
that
he
was
violating
the
federal
communications
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
he
divulge
them,
you
would
say
you
would
be
violating
the
federal
communication.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
can't
the
officers
exercise
the
same
privilege
and
attach
their
own
party
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
not
participating
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
your
client
had
put
in
such
a
device
on
his
own
phone
and
had
recorded
other
people
to
conversations
you
would
say
he
would
violate
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
although,
it
wouldn't
if
he
just
picked
up
the
phone
and
listen
to
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
--
if
he
picked
up
the
phone
and
listen
to
it
and
then
published
even
though
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
his
own
phone.
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly
not
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
somebody
else
with
conversation?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
an
ordinary
risk
of
the
thing
on
the
party
line,
is
it?
if
--
if
one
is
one
party
line
obviously
and
takes
as
to
understand
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
on
your
position
that
you
would
say
there
was
no
tap
and
no
violation
of
the
federal
communications
act
if
the
police
after
having
acquired
the
party
line
had
gone
outside
their
own
house
and
on
some
other
part
of
the
telephone
line
tapped
the
wire
because
they
could've
picked
the
phone
and
listen
that
they
could
also
listen
on
the
line
anywhere
else
and
anywhere
else
they
wanted
to
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
perhaps
none
of
somebody
else's
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
along
the
street
when
the
telephone
rang,
it's
just
like
put
a
tap
on
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
this
device
they
put
in
their
own
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
suggesting
the
katz
is
retroactive
and
it
applies
to
this
case
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
--
you
urged
us
to
hold
katz
retroactive?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
katz
whether
it's
retroactive
or
not
it's
just
irrelevant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
because
there's
nothing
in
the
facts
of
this
case
just
wouldn't
fall
within
katz
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
allbritton,
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
saying
that
the
police
may
run
the
house
or
install
a
party
line
in
order
to
listen
on
and
establish
party
line
the
conversations
between
other
people
on
the
party
line
that
you
would
necessarily
argue
that
even
without
renting
a
party
line
from
any
from
the
telephone
company
that
they
could
just
simply
tap
a
party
line
anytime
or
any
place
they
wanted
to
because
the
people
who
talk
on
that
line
anticipate
that
somebody
is
going
to
overhear
them
and
if
it
would
justify
the
police
in
buying
a
party
line
and
picking
up
the
receiver
and
listening
to
other
parties
on
the
line
i
don't
know
why
it
wouldn't
justify
the
police
in
just
not
running
a
party
line
but
just
tapping
the
wire.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
isn't
this
just
one
smooth
way
of
tapping
a
party
line,
you
just
rent
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
would
say
then
they
wouldn't
have
had
to
rent
the
party
line
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
let's
just
say
--
i'm
not
--
this
is
just
another
way
of
tapping
a
wire
as
you
said.
it's
another
way
of
tapping
a
wire.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
under
605
you
wouldn't
i'm
sure
that
just
to
be
renting
a
party
line
probably
to
tap
under
605
but
we're
talking
about
the
fourth
amendment
also.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
attorney
general,
it
seems
to
me
that
to
exclude
this
evidence
would
require
one
either
holding
that
this
was
a
violation
of
605
in
which
event,
you
have
to
overrule
force?
or
holding
that,
this
is
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
which
event
you
would
have
to
hold
katz
retroactive,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
the
--
do
you
think
before
the
katz
case
was
decided
that
this
was
a
violation
of
--
would've
been
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
katz.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
when
you
--
are
you
--
i
thought
you
were
arguing
this
was
not
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
before
the
katz
case
was
decided
now
would
the
state
have
been
permitted
under
the
fourth
amendment
to
use
the
evidence
which
it
had
got
over
this
party
line.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
know
you
think
that
after
katz
the
same
thing
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
but
why
would
the
state
if
that
permitted
to
use
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wouldn't
have
been
permitted
to
use
it
under
olmstead?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
when
was
the
olmstead
overruled?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
is
there
a
finding
to
that
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
the
opinion
of
the
florida
court
say
the
facts
in
this
case
show
the
defendants
requested
private
line
but
were
in
more
by
the
telephone
company
that
no
private
line
was
unavailable?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
that
a
florida
court
on
this
historical
fact
finding
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
should
differ
with
the
florida
court
on
this?
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
if
this
finding
is
really
relevant
to
the
issue
if
the
court
wants
to
file
or
believe
with
the
historical
fact
that
the
florida
properly
stated
the
question
and
i
would
certainly
be
happy
to
go
along
because
i
believe
the
very
ruling
of
the
florida
court
is
limited
to
the
statement
that
your
honor
had
just
made
or
the
finding
of
the
florida
court
that
there
was
knowledge
on
the
part
of
mr.
lee
that
he
was
getting
a
private
--
a
party
line
instead
of
a
private
line.
the
first
and
most
obvious
fact
is
that
at
no
time
did
the
police
or
the
deputy
sheriff
seek
a
search
warrant
to
obtain
the
information
which
they
subsequently
obtained
by
the
use
of
this
equipment.
now,
to
go
in
a
little
bit
more
into
the
history
of
what
happened.
once
the
defendant
lee
obtained
this
party
line,
the
police
arranged
with
the
winter
park
telephone
company
to
install
a
party
--
another
party
line
in
a
house
which
were
rendered
--
which
was
rendered
by
the
police
and
an
electronic
actuator
and
some
other
sophisticated
type
of
electronic
surveillance
equipment
was
attached
to
a
wall
outlet
in
the
house
which
permitted
the
police
to
overhear
by
headsets
and
to
record
by
equipment,
recording
equipment
all
the
conversations
that
were
either
placed
from
an
outgoing
call
or
were
received
by
incoming
calls.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
nor
has
the
state
contend
in
its
brief
and
our
position
to
this
petition
that
the
police
had
probable
cause
to
conduct
a
general
search
which
i
believe
the
state
of
florida
will
have
to
concede.
they
did
in
this
fact,
a
mere
search
for
evidence
which
of
course
has
been
condemned
by
this
court
many
times.
there
was
no
effort
whatsoever
to
obtain
a
search
warrant
to
conduct
the
search.
the
police
merely
arranged
to
have
a
party
line
installed
in
mr.
lee's
house
and
for
the
telephone
company
to
install
a
line
whereby
they
could
intercept
and
record
the
messages.
i
believe
that
the
distinction
is
there
is
one
amounts
to
no
difference
for
this
reason
mr.
justice
white
in
answer
to
your
question.
admittedly
mr.
lee,
according
to
the
findings
of
the
appellate
court
of
florida
had
knowledge
that
there
was
a
party
line
in
existence.
this
creates
then
a
double
standard
if
mr.
marette
who
called
in
from
his
private
line
and
if
mr.
brashin
who
called
in
on
their
private
line
are
protected
either
under
the
fourth
amendment
or
by
section
605
of
the
federal
communications
act
then
it
would
resolve
itself
to
an
economic
problem.
that
is
a
person
who
can
afford
a
private
line
carries
the
immunities
of
a
private
line
without
the
burdens
of
perhaps
being
eavesdropped
upon.
now,
like
this
court
has
and
of
course
counsel
is
certainly
aware
of
schwartz
versus
texas
a
case
some
years
ago
where
in
this
court
held
that
section
605
of
the
federal
communications
act
does
not
apply
in
state
court
and
we're
cognizant
of
this
case
and
i'm
satisfied
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
will
argue
this
case
very
strongly.
but
i
have
noted
in
the
recent
case
of
pugach
versus
dollinger
where
justices
of
this
court
including
the
chief
justice
have
stated
that
the
rationale
or
the
underpinnings
of
schwartz
had
been
swept
away
by
the
case
of
benanti
versus
the
united
states.
now,
in
the
pugach
case,
although
there
was
an
affirmance
of
the
lower
court,
the
issue
was
not
directly
connected
with
the
question
of
the
applicability
of
the
rule
of
exclusion
under
605
in
this
federal
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
if
your
--
if
your
client
had
just
short
of
his
own
telephone
in
his
own
house
and
made
a
connection
with
the
wires
in
order
to
record
his
own
conversations
for
his
record,
i
would
suppose
you
would
under
your
theory
argue
that
he
was
violating
the
federal
communications
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
he
divulge
them,
you
would
say
you
would
be
violating
the
federal
communication.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
can't
the
officers
exercise
the
same
privilege
and
attach
their
own
party
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
not
participating
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
your
client
had
put
in
such
a
device
on
his
own
phone
and
had
recorded
other
people
to
conversations
you
would
say
he
would
violate
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
although,
it
wouldn't
if
he
just
picked
up
the
phone
and
listen
to
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
--
if
he
picked
up
the
phone
and
listen
to
it
and
then
published
even
though
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
his
own
phone.
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly
not
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
somebody
else
with
conversation?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
an
ordinary
risk
of
the
thing
on
the
party
line,
is
it?
if
--
if
one
is
one
party
line
obviously
and
takes
as
to
understand
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
on
your
position
that
you
would
say
there
was
no
tap
and
no
violation
of
the
federal
communications
act
if
the
police
after
having
acquired
the
party
line
had
gone
outside
their
own
house
and
on
some
other
part
of
the
telephone
line
tapped
the
wire
because
they
could've
picked
the
phone
and
listen
that
they
could
also
listen
on
the
line
anywhere
else
and
anywhere
else
they
wanted
to
do.

perhaps
none
of
somebody
else's
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
along
the
street
when
the
telephone
rang,
it's
just
like
put
a
tap
on
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
this
device
they
put
in
their
own
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
suggesting
the
katz
is
retroactive
and
it
applies
to
this
case
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
--
you
urged
us
to
hold
katz
retroactive?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
katz
whether
it's
retroactive
or
not
it's
just
irrelevant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
because
there's
nothing
in
the
facts
of
this
case
just
wouldn't
fall
within
katz
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
allbritton,
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
saying
that
the
police
may
run
the
house
or
install
a
party
line
in
order
to
listen
on
and
establish
party
line
the
conversations
between
other
people
on
the
party
line
that
you
would
necessarily
argue
that
even
without
renting
a
party
line
from
any
from
the
telephone
company
that
they
could
just
simply
tap
a
party
line
anytime
or
any
place
they
wanted
to
because
the
people
who
talk
on
that
line
anticipate
that
somebody
is
going
to
overhear
them
and
if
it
would
justify
the
police
in
buying
a
party
line
and
picking
up
the
receiver
and
listening
to
other
parties
on
the
line
i
don't
know
why
it
wouldn't
justify
the
police
in
just
not
running
a
party
line
but
just
tapping
the
wire.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
isn't
this
just
one
smooth
way
of
tapping
a
party
line,
you
just
rent
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
would
say
then
they
wouldn't
have
had
to
rent
the
party
line
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
let's
just
say
--
i'm
not
--
this
is
just
another
way
of
tapping
a
wire
as
you
said.
it's
another
way
of
tapping
a
wire.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
under
605
you
wouldn't
i'm
sure
that
just
to
be
renting
a
party
line
probably
to
tap
under
605
but
we're
talking
about
the
fourth
amendment
also.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
attorney
general,
it
seems
to
me
that
to
exclude
this
evidence
would
require
one
either
holding
that
this
was
a
violation
of
605
in
which
event,
you
have
to
overrule
force?
or
holding
that,
this
is
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
which
event
you
would
have
to
hold
katz
retroactive,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
the
--
do
you
think
before
the
katz
case
was
decided
that
this
was
a
violation
of
--
would've
been
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
katz.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
when
you
--
are
you
--
i
thought
you
were
arguing
this
was
not
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
before
the
katz
case
was
decided
now
would
the
state
have
been
permitted
under
the
fourth
amendment
to
use
the
evidence
which
it
had
got
over
this
party
line.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
know
you
think
that
after
katz
the
same
thing
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
but
why
would
the
state
if
that
permitted
to
use
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wouldn't
have
been
permitted
to
use
it
under
olmstead?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
when
was
the
olmstead
overruled?
