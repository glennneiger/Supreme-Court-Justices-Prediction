mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
controlling
question
as
i
understand
it
to
be
in
this
case
is
whether
a
person
who
is
operating
an
illegal
gambling
operation
over
a
party
line
telephone
has
a
constitutionally
protected
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
before
addressing
myself
to
that
question,
i
would
like
to
comment
very
briefly
on
the
remarks
made
by
my
colleague.
first,
to
answer
a
question
put
by
one
of
the
justices,
petitioner
lee
did
in
fact
know
that
he
was
on
a
party
line
and
he
had
been
told
by
the
man
who
installed
the
party
line
telephone
and
that
is
in
the
appendix.
next,
one
of
the
members
of
this
court
inquired
as
to
whether
or
not
the
court
below
did
find
that
the
petitioner
had
been
told
that
he
was
on
a
party
line
telephone
and
that
court
did
sole
said
out
in
its
opinion
and
that
is
in
the
appendix
also.
now,
we
contend
that
there
was
no
wire
tapped
in
this
case
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
communications
act.
all
the
police
officers
it
did
was
to
have
a
telephone
installed
in
a
house
on
a
party
line
and
in
order
not
to
have
to
pick
up
the
handle
of
it
every
time
the
telephone
rang
in
there,
they
put
an
automatic
actuator
attached
to
their
own
party
line
so
that
when
the
telephone
rang
in
the
petitioner's
house
they
could
hear
it
without
having
to
go
through
the
manual
operation
of
picking
up
the
telephone
handle.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
don't
know
sir
but
i
would
assume
that
it
would.
if
it
did
it
is
not
brought
out
in
the
transcript
that's
before
this
court.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
that's
the
reason
i
say
that
i
assume
it
would.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
absolutely
not.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
the
silverman
case
as
i
understand
it
was
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
you're
talking
about
the
heating
apparatus
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
if
i
recall
correctly
i
believe
that
case
turned
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
physical
intuitive
--
in
that
case.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
sir?
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
what's
not
running
into
his
house.
no,
sir.
it
was
hooked
up
to
their
own
party
line.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
it
was
hooked
up
to
their
telephone
so
that
they
could
over
hear
the
conversations.
now,
we
condemn
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
sir?
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
he
is
so
contend
and
i
contend
just
strongly
that
they
did
not
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,sir.
not
that
i
know
of
and
there
isn't
anything
in
the
transcript
before
this
court
i
think
that
would
in
anyway
prove
that
the
police
were
responsible
for
lee
getting
a
party
line
rather
than
a
private
line.
nothing
whatsoever
as
i
read
it.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
not
anywhere
else,
no,
sir
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
if
they
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
that
we
could
sustain
anything
like
that.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
well,
on
a
party
line
there
is
no
a
law
which
prevents
a
man
from
picking
up
the
telephone
and
hearing
the
conversation
of
two
other
people
and
may
it
not
be
the
proper
thing
to
do
but
there's
no
law
against
it.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
sir.
i
don't
agree
with
that.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
oh,
i
see.
let
me
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
sir.
they
are
the
same
type
of
party
lines
that
you
find
all
over
the
country.
now,
assume
that
they
are
clicks
there.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
if
he
had
heard
the
click,
he
would,
yes
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
and
if
you
forgive
me
sir,
i
believe
that
to
say
that
he
would've
known
that
there
was
someone
hearing
what
he
had
to
say
your
honor
i
believe
that's
a
conclusion
sir.
he
may
or
may
not.
he,
it
depends
on
the
click
if
he
could
hear
it
if
the
click
was
audible.
and
we
don't
know.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
sir.
that
is
one
of
the
reasons.
the
main
reason
was
to
keep
the
police
officer
from
having
to
pick
up
the
thing
every
time
the
telephone
rang
and
he
had
a
headset
on,
where
he
could
hear
it.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
that
this
becomes
arguous
at
times
over
a
period
of
time.
now,
as
i
believe
what
we
are
concerned
here
with
is
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
lee
in
conducting
an
illegal
gambling
operation
over
a
party
line
telephone
had
a
constitutionally
protected
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
now,
on
the
one
hand
we
have
hester
v.
united
states
which
says
that
a
man
in
an
open
lot
does
not
have
a
reasonable
expectation
then
on
the
other
hand
we
have
the
recent
katz
case.
i
agree
with
the
katz
case.
i
think
that
when
a
man
goes
in
a
telephone
booth
and
closes
the
door,
pays
the
toll
and
talks
that
he
is
justified
to
believe
that
the
words
he
speaks
can
only
be
heard
for
the
--
by
the
person
for
whom
they
are
intended.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
would
hope
that
it
would
be,
i
don't
know
whether
it
is
or
not
and
whether
courts
going
to
have
it
be
retroactive
or
not.
in
ascertaining
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
don't
believe
that
you
would
have
to
hold
katz
to
be
retroactive
in
order
to
sustain
this
case
justice
white.
because
i
don't
believe
that
the
petitioner
lee
had
a
reasonable
expectation
that
what
he
spoke
would
be
heard
by
only
--
by
the
person
for
whom
intended
that
is
protected
by
the
constitution.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
i
don't
think
it's
irrelevant
at
all.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
don't
think
katz
that
the
case
here
can
be
controlled
by
katz.
now,
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
is
a
reasonable
expectation,
first
we
have
to
look
at
where
the
person
is
at;
two,
what
the
person
is
doing;
and
third
how
it
is
being
done.
now,
here
the
man
was
in
his
private
house;
two,
he
was
conducting
an
illegal
gambling
operation;
and
three,
he
was
doing
it
over
a
known
party
line.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
absolutely.
let
me
--
i
believe
that
what
this
man
was
doing
in
this
case
is
important
in
determining
whether
or
not
he
had
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
for
example,
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
that
a
college
boy
calling
a
girl
and
asking
her
to
go
out,
he
is
not
too
concerned
i
don't
believe
with
whether
or
not
some
one
over
hears
him
because
he
knows
that
he
even
he
is
overheard
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
--
that
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
your
honor,
he
was.
he
was
in
gambling.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
it
goes
to
ascertaining
his
intent
whether
or
not
he
had
a
right
to
believe
he
had
a
constitutionally
protected
right
of
privacy.
that's
what
he
has
to
do
with
it.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
can
only
assume
that
they
did
or
else
they
would
not
have
installed
the
party
line
telephone
to
overhear
the
conversation
and
again
mr.
chief
justice
i
deny
it
was
a
tap.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
sir.
i
believe
that
they
knew
it
and
i
believe
that
they
can
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
sir.
i
don't
believe
it
is.
if
it
is,
i
don't
recall
it
at
this
time.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
well,
if
--
then
if
they
tap
the
wire
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
it
is
a
smooth
wire
of
tapping
a
party
line,
i
agree.
this
was
a
legitimate
investigation
by
the
sheriff's
office
into
the
crime
activities
in
orange
county.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
sir.
i
don't
say
that
because
there,
if
they
had
their
own
party
line
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
--
then
they
have
a
right
to
pick
it
up
and
hear
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
it's
a
way
of
overhearing
a
conversation
mr.
justice
white.
i
don't
agree
that
was
a
tap.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
and
getting
to
the
fourth
amendment
and
going
back
to
what
he
was
doing,
i
again
reiterate
that
the
college
boy
would
not
be
too
concerned
with
who
overheard
him
for
this
reason
if
the
court
please
he
knows
that
he
is
not
violating
any
law
and
he
knows
he's
not
going
to
be
prosecuted.
now,
that
isn't
the
case
here.
this
man
knew
he
was
violating
the
law
and
he
knew
that
the
police
were
trying
to
shall
we
say
apprehend
him
or
catch
him.
and
so,
he
had
reason
to
believe
and
be
cautious
in
the
words
that
he
spoke.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
sir.
they
were
private
lines.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
here,
if
the
petitioner
had
been
talking
on
a
private
line
in
his
own
house
then
as
far
as
i'm
concern
i
would
be
out
of
court
because
there
i
believe
that
the
man
would
have
a
constitutionally
protected
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
but
where
he
is
not
talking
on
a
private
line
he
knows
he
is
talking
on
a
party
line,
i
don't
believe
that
he
has
such
a
constitutionally
protected
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
i
think
therein
lies
the
turning
point
in
this
case.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
as
long
as
they
have
a
right
to
do
so
in
this
sense
sir,
in
the
sense
that
they
are
in
a
house
that
they
pay
the
rent
on
it
and
that
they
have
their
own
telephone
installed
in
there.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
sir.
i
don't.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
think
that
is
too
broad
a
right
to
give
to
the
police
officers.
to
have
him
overhear
everything
that
goes
on
in
town.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
here
they
were
only
listening
on
one
party
line,
justice
brennan.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
draw
the
line
sir
between
what
a
man
have
the
reasonable
right
to
believe.
now,
if
this
man
as
i
say
had
been
talking
on
a
private
line
then
i
say
to
you
sir
that
i
would
be
out
of
court.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
alright,
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
will
answer
that
this
way,
i
would
say
that
if
they
had
just
gone
out
and
through
an
undercover
agent
and
ascertain
where
the
party
line
was
at
and
then
put
a
device
on
it
where
they
could
overhear
it
then
i
think
that's
wrong.
i
think
that
would
be
incorrect
and
i
don't
believe
to
this
court
would
uphold
it.
i
don't
believe
they
can
do
that
but
when
they
rent
a
house
and
pay
for
the
installation
of
a
telephone
and
they
do
it
in
their
own
house,
on
their
own
telephone
and
it's
not
a
violation
of
any
law
whatsoever
then
i
don't
see
anything
wrong
with
it.
i
think
that
is
legitimate
criminal
investigation,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
absolutely,
they
did.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
well,
the
difference
is
i
don't
believe
this
court
would
permit
them
to
go
out
ipso
facto
you
might
say
and
tap
a
party
line.
here,
i
don't
believe
there
was
a
tap.
it
was
merely
that
they
overheard
what
was
going
on
and
that
is
what
the
petitioner
and
is
the
risk,
the
risks
that
the
petitioner
took
when
he
spoke
on
a
party
line
telephone
party.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
would
suspect
sir
that
there
wasn't
a
room
nearby
that
they
could
use.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
that's
right.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
they
were
all
on
the
party
line.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
may
be.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
that's
right
and
that's
it.
i'd
like
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
what
this
court
had
to
say
in
katz
versus
united
states.
the
court
laid
down
a
root
to
there
and
i
want
to
quote
it,
this
court
had
this
to
say,
"what
a
person
knowingly
exposes
to
the
public
even
in
his
own
home
or
office
is
not
a
subject
of
fourth
amendment
protection."
and
i
say
to
this
court
that
one
of
the
best
ways
to
expose
anything
to
the
public
is
to
talk
about
it
on
a
party
line
telephone.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
sir.
i
don't
--
maybe
i
don't
understand
you
possibly.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
i
do.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
because
i
believe
that
the
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you
sir,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
believe
it
would
have,
yes
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
the
state
would
have
been
permitted
to
use
it
i
believe
as
i
have
reiterated
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
they
could
have.
that's
true
olmstead
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
believe
that
katz
case
finally
cut
the
underpinnings
i
believe
is
the
word
that
was
used
from
the
olmstead
case,
i
believe.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
can't
answer
that.
i
have
not
given
any
thought
whatsoever
to
that
type
of
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
i
do.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
don't
know
sir.
i
can't
answer
that
right
after
that.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
sir.
he
wasn't
communicating
his
lawyer
and
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
you
do
and
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
let
me
put
it
this
way
sir.
i
don't
believe
that
the
use
of
the
party
line
means
that
a
person
has
released
all
claims
or
rights
of
confidentiality
but
i
do
believe
that
it
does
release
his
right
to
have
his
conversation
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
constitution.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
can't
give
you
a
categorical
answer
on
that
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
that's
true
sir.
i
do
agree
with
that.
i
have
nothing
follow
up.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
controlling
question
as
i
understand
it
to
be
in
this
case
is
whether
a
person
who
is
operating
an
illegal
gambling
operation
over
a
party
line
telephone
has
a
constitutionally
protected
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
before
addressing
myself
to
that
question,
i
would
like
to
comment
very
briefly
on
the
remarks
made
by
my
colleague.
first,
to
answer
a
question
put
by
one
of
the
justices,
petitioner
lee
did
in
fact
know
that
he
was
on
a
party
line
and
he
had
been
told
by
the
man
who
installed
the
party
line
telephone
and
that
is
in
the
appendix.
next,
one
of
the
members
of
this
court
inquired
as
to
whether
or
not
the
court
below
did
find
that
the
petitioner
had
been
told
that
he
was
on
a
party
line
telephone
and
that
court
did
sole
said
out
in
its
opinion
and
that
is
in
the
appendix
also.
now,
we
contend
that
there
was
no
wire
tapped
in
this
case
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
communications
act.
all
the
police
officers
it
did
was
to
have
a
telephone
installed
in
a
house
on
a
party
line
and
in
order
not
to
have
to
pick
up
the
handle
of
it
every
time
the
telephone
rang
in
there,
they
put
an
automatic
actuator
attached
to
their
own
party
line
so
that
when
the
telephone
rang
in
the
petitioner's
house
they
could
hear
it
without
having
to
go
through
the
manual
operation
of
picking
up
the
telephone
handle.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
don't
know
sir
but
i
would
assume
that
it
would.
if
it
did
it
is
not
brought
out
in
the
transcript
that's
before
this
court.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
that's
the
reason
i
say
that
i
assume
it
would.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
absolutely
not.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
the
silverman
case
as
i
understand
it
was
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
you're
talking
about
the
heating
apparatus
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
if
i
recall
correctly
i
believe
that
case
turned
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
physical
intuitive
--
in
that
case.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
sir?
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
what's
not
running
into
his
house.
no,
sir.
it
was
hooked
up
to
their
own
party
line.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
it
was
hooked
up
to
their
telephone
so
that
they
could
over
hear
the
conversations.
now,
we
condemn
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
sir?
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
he
is
so
contend
and
i
contend
just
strongly
that
they
did
not
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,sir.
not
that
i
know
of
and
there
isn't
anything
in
the
transcript
before
this
court
i
think
that
would
in
anyway
prove
that
the
police
were
responsible
for
lee
getting
a
party
line
rather
than
a
private
line.
nothing
whatsoever
as
i
read
it.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
not
anywhere
else,
no,
sir
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
if
they
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
that
we
could
sustain
anything
like
that.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
well,
on
a
party
line
there
is
no
a
law
which
prevents
a
man
from
picking
up
the
telephone
and
hearing
the
conversation
of
two
other
people
and
may
it
not
be
the
proper
thing
to
do
but
there's
no
law
against
it.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
sir.
i
don't
agree
with
that.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
oh,
i
see.
let
me
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
sir.
they
are
the
same
type
of
party
lines
that
you
find
all
over
the
country.
now,
assume
that
they
are
clicks
there.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
if
he
had
heard
the
click,
he
would,
yes
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
and
if
you
forgive
me
sir,
i
believe
that
to
say
that
he
would've
known
that
there
was
someone
hearing
what
he
had
to
say
your
honor
i
believe
that's
a
conclusion
sir.
he
may
or
may
not.
he,
it
depends
on
the
click
if
he
could
hear
it
if
the
click
was
audible.
and
we
don't
know.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
sir.
that
is
one
of
the
reasons.
the
main
reason
was
to
keep
the
police
officer
from
having
to
pick
up
the
thing
every
time
the
telephone
rang
and
he
had
a
headset
on,
where
he
could
hear
it.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
that
this
becomes
arguous
at
times
over
a
period
of
time.
now,
as
i
believe
what
we
are
concerned
here
with
is
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
lee
in
conducting
an
illegal
gambling
operation
over
a
party
line
telephone
had
a
constitutionally
protected
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
now,
on
the
one
hand
we
have
hester
v.
united
states
which
says
that
a
man
in
an
open
lot
does
not
have
a
reasonable
expectation
then
on
the
other
hand
we
have
the
recent
katz
case.
i
agree
with
the
katz
case.
i
think
that
when
a
man
goes
in
a
telephone
booth
and
closes
the
door,
pays
the
toll
and
talks
that
he
is
justified
to
believe
that
the
words
he
speaks
can
only
be
heard
for
the
--
by
the
person
for
whom
they
are
intended.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
would
hope
that
it
would
be,
i
don't
know
whether
it
is
or
not
and
whether
courts
going
to
have
it
be
retroactive
or
not.
in
ascertaining
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
don't
believe
that
you
would
have
to
hold
katz
to
be
retroactive
in
order
to
sustain
this
case
justice
white.
because
i
don't
believe
that
the
petitioner
lee
had
a
reasonable
expectation
that
what
he
spoke
would
be
heard
by
only
--
by
the
person
for
whom
intended
that
is
protected
by
the
constitution.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
i
don't
think
it's
irrelevant
at
all.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
don't
think
katz
that
the
case
here
can
be
controlled
by
katz.
now,
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
is
a
reasonable
expectation,
first
we
have
to
look
at
where
the
person
is
at;
two,
what
the
person
is
doing;
and
third
how
it
is
being
done.
now,
here
the
man
was
in
his
private
house;
two,
he
was
conducting
an
illegal
gambling
operation;
and
three,
he
was
doing
it
over
a
known
party
line.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
absolutely.
let
me
--
i
believe
that
what
this
man
was
doing
in
this
case
is
important
in
determining
whether
or
not
he
had
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
for
example,
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
that
a
college
boy
calling
a
girl
and
asking
her
to
go
out,
he
is
not
too
concerned
i
don't
believe
with
whether
or
not
some
one
over
hears
him
because
he
knows
that
he
even
he
is
overheard
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
--
that
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
your
honor,
he
was.
he
was
in
gambling.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
it
goes
to
ascertaining
his
intent
whether
or
not
he
had
a
right
to
believe
he
had
a
constitutionally
protected
right
of
privacy.
that's
what
he
has
to
do
with
it.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
can
only
assume
that
they
did
or
else
they
would
not
have
installed
the
party
line
telephone
to
overhear
the
conversation
and
again
mr.
chief
justice
i
deny
it
was
a
tap.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
sir.
i
believe
that
they
knew
it
and
i
believe
that
they
can
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
sir.
i
don't
believe
it
is.
if
it
is,
i
don't
recall
it
at
this
time.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
well,
if
--
then
if
they
tap
the
wire
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
it
is
a
smooth
wire
of
tapping
a
party
line,
i
agree.
this
was
a
legitimate
investigation
by
the
sheriff's
office
into
the
crime
activities
in
orange
county.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
sir.
i
don't
say
that
because
there,
if
they
had
their
own
party
line
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
--
then
they
have
a
right
to
pick
it
up
and
hear
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
it's
a
way
of
overhearing
a
conversation
mr.
justice
white.
i
don't
agree
that
was
a
tap.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
and
getting
to
the
fourth
amendment
and
going
back
to
what
he
was
doing,
i
again
reiterate
that
the
college
boy
would
not
be
too
concerned
with
who
overheard
him
for
this
reason
if
the
court
please
he
knows
that
he
is
not
violating
any
law
and
he
knows
he's
not
going
to
be
prosecuted.
now,
that
isn't
the
case
here.
this
man
knew
he
was
violating
the
law
and
he
knew
that
the
police
were
trying
to
shall
we
say
apprehend
him
or
catch
him.
and
so,
he
had
reason
to
believe
and
be
cautious
in
the
words
that
he
spoke.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
sir.
they
were
private
lines.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
here,
if
the
petitioner
had
been
talking
on
a
private
line
in
his
own
house
then
as
far
as
i'm
concern
i
would
be
out
of
court
because
there
i
believe
that
the
man
would
have
a
constitutionally
protected
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
but
where
he
is
not
talking
on
a
private
line
he
knows
he
is
talking
on
a
party
line,
i
don't
believe
that
he
has
such
a
constitutionally
protected
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
i
think
therein
lies
the
turning
point
in
this
case.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
as
long
as
they
have
a
right
to
do
so
in
this
sense
sir,
in
the
sense
that
they
are
in
a
house
that
they
pay
the
rent
on
it
and
that
they
have
their
own
telephone
installed
in
there.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
sir.
i
don't.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
think
that
is
too
broad
a
right
to
give
to
the
police
officers.
to
have
him
overhear
everything
that
goes
on
in
town.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
here
they
were
only
listening
on
one
party
line,
justice
brennan.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
draw
the
line
sir
between
what
a
man
have
the
reasonable
right
to
believe.
now,
if
this
man
as
i
say
had
been
talking
on
a
private
line
then
i
say
to
you
sir
that
i
would
be
out
of
court.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
alright,
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
will
answer
that
this
way,
i
would
say
that
if
they
had
just
gone
out
and
through
an
undercover
agent
and
ascertain
where
the
party
line
was
at
and
then
put
a
device
on
it
where
they
could
overhear
it
then
i
think
that's
wrong.
i
think
that
would
be
incorrect
and
i
don't
believe
to
this
court
would
uphold
it.
i
don't
believe
they
can
do
that
but
when
they
rent
a
house
and
pay
for
the
installation
of
a
telephone
and
they
do
it
in
their
own
house,
on
their
own
telephone
and
it's
not
a
violation
of
any
law
whatsoever
then
i
don't
see
anything
wrong
with
it.
i
think
that
is
legitimate
criminal
investigation,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
absolutely,
they
did.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
well,
the
difference
is
i
don't
believe
this
court
would
permit
them
to
go
out
ipso
facto
you
might
say
and
tap
a
party
line.
here,
i
don't
believe
there
was
a
tap.
it
was
merely
that
they
overheard
what
was
going
on
and
that
is
what
the
petitioner
and
is
the
risk,
the
risks
that
the
petitioner
took
when
he
spoke
on
a
party
line
telephone
party.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
would
suspect
sir
that
there
wasn't
a
room
nearby
that
they
could
use.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
that's
right.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
they
were
all
on
the
party
line.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
may
be.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
that's
right
and
that's
it.
i'd
like
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
what
this
court
had
to
say
in
katz
versus
united
states.
the
court
laid
down
a
root
to
there
and
i
want
to
quote
it,
this
court
had
this
to
say,
"what
a
person
knowingly
exposes
to
the
public
even
in
his
own
home
or
office
is
not
a
subject
of
fourth
amendment
protection."
and
i
say
to
this
court
that
one
of
the
best
ways
to
expose
anything
to
the
public
is
to
talk
about
it
on
a
party
line
telephone.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
sir.
i
don't
--
maybe
i
don't
understand
you
possibly.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
i
do.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
because
i
believe
that
the
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you
sir,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
believe
it
would
have,
yes
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
the
state
would
have
been
permitted
to
use
it
i
believe
as
i
have
reiterated
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
they
could
have.
that's
true
olmstead
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
believe
that
katz
case
finally
cut
the
underpinnings
i
believe
is
the
word
that
was
used
from
the
olmstead
case,
i
believe.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
can't
answer
that.
i
have
not
given
any
thought
whatsoever
to
that
type
of
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
i
do.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
don't
know
sir.
i
can't
answer
that
right
after
that.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
no,
sir.
he
wasn't
communicating
his
lawyer
and
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
yes,
sir.
you
do
and
--
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
let
me
put
it
this
way
sir.
i
don't
believe
that
the
use
of
the
party
line
means
that
a
person
has
released
all
claims
or
rights
of
confidentiality
but
i
do
believe
that
it
does
release
his
right
to
have
his
conversation
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
constitution.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
i
can't
give
you
a
categorical
answer
on
that
sir.
mr.
wallace
e.
allbritton
that's
true
sir.
i
do
agree
with
that.
i
have
nothing
follow
up.
