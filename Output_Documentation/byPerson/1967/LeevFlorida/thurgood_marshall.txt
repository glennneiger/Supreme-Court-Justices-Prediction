justice

marshall
mr.
kirkland,
getting
back
to
party
phones
all
around
orlando
you
were
talking
about
and
assuming
that
you
could
assume
that
somebody
might
listening
on
your
conversations,
would
that
be
correct
that
you
wouldn't
assume
that
somebody
will
be
recording
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
they
would
not
be
used?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
got
a
special
kind
of
party
lines
in
florida,
you
don't
hear
it
click?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
you
pick
up
the
receiver,
there's
a
click?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
in
this,
if
that
if
you
picked
the
receiver
he
would've
known
somebody
was
listening?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
assuming
he
had
normal
hearing
and
he
heard
the
click,
he
would
know
somebody
was
listening
in
or
would
the
device
the
way
you
put
it
on
he
could
never
know
whether
that
somebody
was
listening.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
that
the
reason
you
put
this
other
one
in
there,
the
activator
so
that
he
wouldn't
hear
it
click?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
would
save
his
energy,
you'd
save
the
policeman's
energy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
wasn't
this
man
in
the
same
business
as
mr.
katz
was?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
what
does
the
business
have
to
do
with
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
install
the
party
lines
and
rent
a
house,
why
not
just
rent
a
room?
