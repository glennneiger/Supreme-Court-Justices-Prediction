how
about

it
took
everything
it
over
the

it
would
follow,
wouldn't
it
if
they
did
get
all
of
those?
chief

nothing
what
party
lines
--
chief
justice
earl

is
that
mean
that
the
police
in
such
a
community
that
tap
any
lines
of
it
wanted
to
in
a
city
anytime
he
wanted
to?
chief

earl
warren

you
draw
the
line?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
leave
it
to
just
then
to
the
party
lines.
in
your
opinion
the

can
tap
any
party
line
a
community
and
monitor
it
was
long
as
they
want
without
any
consequences.
chief
justice
earl
warren

where

you
draw
the

as
to
what
lines
the
police
can
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
what
was
they
cannot?
chief
justice

didn't
rent
this

rented
it
for
this
purpose,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
is
difference
if
they
did
it
for
that
purpose
between
that
in
accomplishing
the
same
purpose
for
a
little
different
way
as
mr.
justice

suggested
putting
a
tap
to
police
stations?
