on
a
party
line?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
evidence
shows
as
i
understand
it
that
your
client
lee
was
advised
that
whenever
he
might've
ordered
he
was
advised
that
he
was
on
a
party
line
by
the
telephone
company?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
so
far
as
the
--
in
so
far
as
this
is
not
a
statutory
violation
but
rather
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
made
applicable
to
the
states
thorough
the
fourteenth
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
then
you
don't
have
any
problem
with
schwartz
do
you
since
mapp
against
ohio
your
situation
is
clear
so
far
as
the
exclusionary
rule
--
justice
potter
stewart
katz
was
a
federal
case.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
katz
was
a
federal
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
directing
my
question
to
your
--
to
the
schwartz
case
which
involved
the
wiretapping
in
violation
of
the
federal
statute,
it
was
held
in
that
case
that
even
though
the
federal
statute
was
violated
the
results
of
what
was
found
in
the
wiretap
could
be
introduced,
could
constitutionally
be
introduced
into
a
state
court
criminal
trial.
that
decision
preceded
mapp
against
ohio?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
so
far
as
in
this
case
you're
relying
not
on
the
violation
of
the
federal
wiretapping
statute
but
rather
a
violation
of
the
--
of
your
client's
right
to
be
free
from
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
you
don't
have
any
problem
about
excludability
do
you
since
mapp
against
ohio.
it's
all
i'm
asking.
justice
potter
stewart
does
--
mr.

did
they
simply
pick
up
the
receiver
and
listen
or
did
they
actually
taps
some
wires
to
put
on
some
kind
of.

how

your
