mr.
michael
h.
rauch
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
reserve
three
minutes
in
the
event
that
i
wish
to
rebut
your
honor.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
this
case
raises
the
question
whether
the
taking
of
union
records
from
union
premises
without
a
warrant
and
not
incident
to
an
arrest
violates
the
fourth
amendment
right
of
a
union
official
to
be
secure
in
his
person,
houses,
papers,
and
effects.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
complicated
and
they
are
not
in
dispute.
briefly,
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
the
respondent
has
never
raised
a
fifth
amendment
issue
as
such
your
honor.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
it's
our
position
as
i
--
and
i
will
get
to
that
shortly.
it's
very
difficult
to
separate
the
nature
of
fourth
amendment
rights
from
the
nature
of
fifth
amendment
rights
in
this
particular
case.
briefly,
the
facts
are
and
i
repeat,
they
are
not
in
dispute.
the
respondent
was
the
vice-president
of
a
local
teamsters
union
in
new
york
city.
he
was
indicted
by
nassau
county
grand
jury
in
1959,
along
with
two
other
union
officials
and
12
other
individuals.
they
were
charged
with
extortion,
coercion,
and
conspiracy
all
in
violation
of
the
new
york
penal
law.
the
substance
of
the
charge
of
the
indictment
was
that
the
defendants
were
using
the
local
union
as
a
tool
to
establish
an
illegal
monopoly
of
the
jukebox
and
gaming
machine
industry
in
the
metropolitan
new
york
city
area.
additionally,
that
they
were
--
through
the
mechanism
of
the
union,
extorting
from
owners
of
such
machines
--
money
from
owners
of
such
machines
by
compelling
payment
of
tribute
disguised
as
union
dues,
initiation
fees,
and
assessments.
shortly,
prior
to
the
return
of
this
indictment,
the
nassau
county
district
attorney
issued
a
subpoena
for
the
books
and
records
of
the
union,
calling
for
these
books
to
be
produced
at
the
district
attorney's
office.
this
subpoena
was
served
upon
--
served
at
the
union
offices
in
manhattan.
their
union
offices
i
believe
were
on
42nd
street
in
manhattan.
it's
been
stipulated
or
conceded
in
this
case
that
the
union
office
consisted
of
one
large
room
in
which
several
of
the
union
officials
and
employees
had
desk
including
the
respondent
in
this
case.
and
the
subpoena
was
served
at
a
time
when
the
respondent
was
present
in
these
offices,
other
people
were
also
present.
the
respondent
refused
to
comply
with
the
subpoena
and
upon
his
refusal
the
police
took
the
union
records
over
the
objection
of
the
respondent.
there
is
no
claim
that
any
of
these
records
were
taken
from
the
respondent's
person
or
from
his
desk
or
from
any
other
place
which
was
set
aside
for
his
personal
use,
nor
is
there
any
claim
that
any
of
his
personal
property
was
taken.
solely,
union
records
were
taken
and
these
included
such
things
as
minutes
of
union
meetings,
applications
of
prospective
members,
union
charter,
deposit
slips.
and
i
should
say
also
that
many
of
these
are
items
and
this
is
also
conceded
here,
many
of
these
items
were
at
least
in
part
prepared
by
the
respondent
here
in
his
role
as
an
officer
of
the
union.
and
again,
most
of
these
items,
a
large
portion
of
these
items
were
introduced
into
evidence
over
objection
at
the
trial
--
at
the
joint
trial
of
the
respondent
and
the
14
other
defendants.
the
respondent
was
--
i
should
add
that
that
trial
took
several
months.
the
respondent
was
convicted
in
1960.
his
appeals
in
the
new
york
state
courts
were
heard
after
this
court's
decision
in
mapp
against
ohio.
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeal
--
the
new
york
courts
considered
his
claims
that
his
fourth
amendment
rights
have
been
violated
by
the
taking
of
the
union
records.
and
they
held
that
the
search
and
seizure
of
the
union
records
did
not
violate
any
of
the
respondent's
fourth
amendment
rights.
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
196
--
in
october
of
1963
and
that
the
respondent
began
serving
his
sentence
of
three
to
five
years,
most
of
which
is
by
now
completed.
in
march
of
1966,
the
respondent
applied
to
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
new
york
for
a
federal
writ
of
habeas
corpus
claiming
among
other
things
and
this
is
the
only
claim
in
this
case
that
his
fourth
amendment
rights
have
been
violated
by
the
search
and
seizure
of
the
union
records.
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
unanimous
conclusion
of
the
new
york
courts
that
no
personal
rights
of
the
respondent
were
violated
by
the
search
and
seizure
of
the
union
records
and
denied
the
writ.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
reversed
and
issued
the
writ
and
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
january
to
review,
as
i
said
before,
the
question
of
whether
this
particular
search
and
seizure
violated
the
personal
fourth
amendment
rights
of
this
defendant
--
of
this
respondent,
to
be
secure
in
his
person,
houses,
papers
and
effects
which
is
the
language
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
language
which
this
court
has
said
many
times
since
the
19th
century
in
boyd
against
united
states,
that
the
purpose
of
this
language
was
to
protect
the
sanctity
of
a
man's
home
and
the
privacies
of
his
life
from
unreasonable
intrusions
by
the
government.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
that's
not
my
understanding
of
new
york
law,
no
your
honor.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
that's
what
happened
here
and
i
do
not
try
to
justify
what
happened
in
this
case
in
terms
of
a
proper
execution
of
the
subpoena
here.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
well
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
that
is
the
question
although
i
would
submit
that
the
term
standing
is
itself
a
shorthand
expression
for
a
description
of
whether
or
not
this
was
an
unlawful
search
in
terms
of
this
particular
individual's
fourth
amendment
rights.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
but
except
for
that,
what
you've
said
is
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
i
believe
so
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
is
our
position
here
that
the
respondent
has
failed
to
show
that
the
search
and
seizure
of
the
union
records
violated
his
personal
rights
either
in
terms
of
the
items
which
were
taken,
or
in
terms
of
the
place
from
which
they
were
taken.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
well,
it's
my
position
that
his
rights
are
no
different
if
that
had
been
what
happened.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
first,
with
respects
--
with
respect
to
the
items
that
were
taken,
that
is
with
respect
to
the
papers
and
effects
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
most
obvious
characteristic
of
these
records
is
that
they
did
not
belong
to
the
respondent
and
i
emphasize
that.
he
does
not
claim
that
they
did
nor
did
he
have
possession
of
these
records
in
any
sort
of
a
personal
capacity.
his
custody
and
it
appears
that
he
was
--
in
terms
of
his
union
role,
the
custodian
of
the
records,
his
custody
of
the
records
were
solely
in
his
capacity
as
a
union
official.
it's
our
position
as
mr.
justice
white
indicated
that
this
possession
in
this
capacity
gives
rise
to
no
personal
privilege
on
behalf
of
this
particular
respondent.
and
we
believe
the
court
has
so
held
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
white,
that
even
a
union
official
who
is
charged
with
the
custody
of
the
union
books
and
records,
has
no
legally
cognizable
personal
interest
in
such
records,
just
as
the
court
has
also
held
that
a
corporate
official
who
has
custody
of
corporate
records
has
no
legally
cognizable
interest
in
corporate
books
and
records.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
he
was
a
vice-president.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
no.
i
think
it
wouldn't.
i
don't
think
it
would
under
united
states
against
white.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
no,
i
think
we
can
assume
that
he
had
as
much
status
as
a
union
officer
could
ever
have
like
--
he
was
the
custodian
of
the
books.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
and
i
think
under
united
states
against
white
that's
irrelevant.
it's
our
position
in
the
absence
of
such
a
personal
interest
which
this
court
has
said
in
the
white
case,
this
respondent
does
not
have,
there
are
no
personal
fourth
amendment
rights
infringed
by
a
seizure.
this
is
--
this
we
believe
is
the
import
of
the
case
of
jones
against
united
states.
that
is
the
first
half
of
the
jones
case,
the
half
dealing
with
seized
items
as
opposed
to
the
half
of
the
jones
case
dealing
with
the
place
where
item
--
from
which
items
were
seized
which
i
will
get
to
shortly.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
i
would
assume
so.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
well,
i
have
foreseen
it
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
an
unincorporated
association
and
that
it
would
have
capacity
to
obtain
return
of
the
records.
it
is
possible
for
a
union
to
become
a
membership
corporation
under
new
york
law
but
i
don't
--
i
wouldn't
think
that
would
make
any
difference.
the
point
is
though
that
there
was
no
--
to
my
knowledge,
no
formal
effort
made
by
the
union
to
obtain
return
of
these
records.
the
respondent
seems
to
take
a
position
here
and
i
assume
the
second
circuit
took
the
same
position
that
there
is
something
about
the
case
of
jones
against
united
states
which
somehow
does
away
with
the
requirement
that
an
individual
objecting
to
a
search
and
seizure
demonstrate
some
personal
interest
in
the
items
seized.
we
believe
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
i
believe
that
that's
the
crux
of
the
second
circuit's
decision,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
well,
what's
wrong
with
that
is
the
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
well,
first
--
in
the
first
place,
factually
that's
not
entirely
correct.
he
was
one
of
15
defendants
that
was
indicted
and
tried
in
this
case,
so
although
they
presumably
were
after
him,
he's
not
the
only
one
they
were
after
and
i
frankly
don't
know
what
they
were
after
precisely
in
terms
of
what
they
thought
the
books
and
records
would
reveal
to
them.
secondly
and
most
importantly,
and
this
is
our
--
perhaps
most
fundamental
disagreement
with
the
conclusion
of
the
second
circuit.
we
don't
believe
that
the
personal
rights
of
this
respondent
or
of
anyone
who
has
custody
of
records
or
indeed
of
anyone
else
should
be
determined
by
whether
or
not
he
happens
to
be
a
suspect
in
the
minds
of
the
police.
i
think
there's
almost
no
other
way
to
read
the
second
circuit
decision
and
there
--
that
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
kind
of
personal
rights
that
the
fourth
amendment
we
believe
was
designed
to
protect,
either
he
had
them
or
he
didn't.
and
the
fact
that
he
was
a
suspect,
it
seems
to
us
is
irrelevant.
and
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
i
think
not.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
what
you
mean
by
his
entries.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
he
kept
the
books
as
--
in
his
role
as
a
union
official.
the
entries
that
were
in
the
bankbooks
are
--
for
example,
he
signed
most
of
the
checks.
he
cosigned
most
of
the
checks.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
i
would
assume
not.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
that's
our
position.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
that's
our
position
and
we
believe
that
united
states
against
white
for
example
supports
it.
we
also
believe
that
the
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
we
also
believe
that
the
jones
case
supports
it,
except
in
the
narrow
areas
of
possessory
crimes
which
this
is
not.
jones
retained
the
assumption
that
an
individual
objecting
to
the
seizure
of
property
had
to
demonstrate
a
personal
interest
in
the
property
seized.
all
jones
did
and
it
is
our
position,
is
create
an
exception
in
those
cases
where
the
defendant
was
charged
with
a
possessory
crime.
and
the
reason,
i
should
point
this
out
here,
the
reason
for
the
exception
is
i
read
it
in
jones
is
because
of
the
intrinsic
unfairness
of
placing
a
defendant
charge
with
a
possessory
crime
in
a
position
of
having
to
prove
his
own
possession
in
order
to
object
to
the
seizure
of
the
item
possessed.
we
would
submit
that
jones
goes
no
further
than
this
in
dispensing
with
the
necessity
of
showing
personal
interest
in
the
property
seized.
but
even
more
in
the
light
of
this
court's
recent
decision
in
the
simmons
case,
i
would
seriously
--
which
i
take
it
solves
most
of
the
dilemma
which
that
aspect
of
the
jones
case
was
designed
to
meet.
there's
certainly
no
reason
for
expanding
this
aspect
of
jones
which
by
its
own
terms
was
limited
to
possessory
crimes.
i
just
would
like
to
reemphasize
that
it's
the
impersonal
character
of
the
books
which
refutes
the
fifth
amendment
as
well
as
the
fourth
amendment
privilege
in
this
case.
the
same
reasoning
which
would
refute
the
fifth
amendment
privilege,
we
submit
should
refute
the
fourth
amendment
privilege.
and
this
is
without
regard
to
the
fact
the
respondent
here
participated
in
the
preparation
of
these
books
and
his
role
as
a
union
official.
we
believe
that
the
same
reasoning
which
this
court
has
used
to
say
that
his
custody
of
the
books
and
records
as
a
union
official
gives
rise
to
no
personal
privilege
would
apply
to
the
fact
the
he
may
have
prepared
these
books
and
records.
but
the
point
is
that
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
i'm
not
--
had
been
a
legal
seizure
in
that
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
well
presumably,
we
wouldn't
be
here
if
that
had
been
the
case.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
well
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
i
don't
want
to
be
in
a
position
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
i
don't
want
to
be
in
a
position
of
defending
the
second
circuit's
decision
mr.
justice
white.
i
don't
believe
that
that's
--
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
--
at
least,
i
don't
read
it
as
saying
that
either
a
warrant
couldn't
issue
or
the
subpoena
be
enforced
in
the
normal
way
under
white.
i
don't
believe
it
intended
at
least
to
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
well
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
this
--
i
under
--
i
see
what
you're
getting
at
and
this
indeed
is
what
we
are
getting
at,
that
is
that
the
rationale
for
the
denial
of
the
privilege
under
white,
namely
the
character
of
the
books,
his
lack
of
any
personal
relationship
to
them
in
the
sense
that
it
does
not
--
they
do
not
involve
any
element
of
the
privacies
of
his
life.
that
same
rationale
and
it
is
our
position
that
it
would,
that
same
rationale
should
deny
the
fourth
amendment
privilege.
so
in
that
sense,
i
suppose
that
the
--
logically,
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
would
undercut
the
reasoning
if
--
and
indeed
the
result
of
the
white
case.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
i
think
it
turns
on
that
fact
as
well
as
on
the
fact
as
mr.
justice
marshall
observed
that
the
search
was
directed
at
this
defendant.
but
our
problem
with
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
this
is
why
were
here
is
because
we
believed
that
that
decision
ignored
the
rationale
for
the
white
case
and
by
making
the
statement
which
you
just
referred
to
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
--
we
believe
that
undermines
the
rationale
of
the
white
case.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
that
sort
of
beside
the
point,
what
they
said
there.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
yes,
i
do
believe
that.
and
i
also
believe
that
the
fourth
--
the
second
circuit
merely
assumed
from
one,
the
fact
that
there
was
no
warrant,
and
two,
the
fact
that
the
search
was
directed
against
this
particular
respondent
that
it
automatically
violated
the
fourth
amendment.
i
think
it
ignored
this
substance
of
the
rights
which
the
fourth
amendment
protects
and
in
doing
so,
i
think
it
also
ignored
the
rationale
of
the
white
decision.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
--
at
least
under
the
white
decision,
that
the
books
and
records
themselves
were
not
privileged
on
behalf
of
this
individual.
and
the
only
way
then
that
the
respondent
could
legitimately
claim
that
his
fourth
amendment
rights
were
violated
by
the
search,
is
if
he
comes
within
the
persons
or
houses
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment.
at
the
outset,
we
recognized
as
the
courts
observed
in
the
katz
case
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
people
and
not
places.
but
it
is
important
here
to
emphasize
that
this
case
does
not
involve
in
any
sense
the
search
of
a
person
or
of
any
place
set
aside
for
the
respondent's
personal
use.
therefore,
it
does
not
involve
as
such
the
security
of
the
respondent's
person,
nor
obviously
does
it
involve
a
search
of
his
home.
and
it's
at
this
point
that
we
get
to
the
second
aspect
of
the
court's
decision
in
jones,
namely
whether
the
respondent
has
shown
that
he
had
a
legally
requisite
interest
in
the
premises
in
order
to
claim
that
an
intrusion
into
those
premises
intruded
into
his
fourth
amendment
rights.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
well,
i
just
--
we
just
went
through
that.
they
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
they
--
what
they
did
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
alright,
i
have
it
at
page
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
it's
page
41
of
the
appendix
at
the
--
in
the
footnote.
the
jones
case,
this
court
held
in
substance
that
defendant
who
was
entitled
to
use
his
friend's
apartment
who
had
free
access
to
that
apartment
was
entitled
to
believe
that
the
sanctity
of
the
home
and
privacies
of
life
extended
to
this
place
which
was
in
effect
an
extension
of
his
home.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
basis
in
this
record
for
concluding
that
the
union
premises
were
such
a
private
place
that
in
terms
of
the
fourth
amendment,
it
was
tantamount
to
an
extension
of
the
respondent's
home.
there
was
nothing
certainly
to
entitle
him
to
consider
the
union
premises
as
a
private
personal
enclave.
there's
nothing
inherently
private
about
these
offices.
he
shared
this
one
large
room
with
other
people
and
it
presumably
was
open
to
the
public.
the
use
of
this
office
was
limited
to
his
function
as
an
officer
of
the
institution.
and
here,
i
would
submit
that
the
same
rationale
which
denies
him
privileges
and
personal
privileges
in
the
books
also
denies
him
personal
privileges
in
the
premises
themselves.
he
should
no
more
have
a
personal
right
in
the
premises
because
he
has
a
right
as
a
--
in
his
capacity
as
a
union
official
to
be
there,
then
he
should
have
a
personal
right
in
the
books
because
he
has
a
right
in
his
capacity
as
a
union
official
to
retain
custody
of
the
books.
i
should
say
that
the
only
really
personal
activities
that
the
defendant
is
trying
to
claim
were
secluded
here
or
his
criminal
activities
which
were
used
by
which
he
used
the
union
as
a
façade
for
engaging
in
various
criminal
activities.
and
we
would
submit
that
there
is
no
more
fourth
amendment
right
to
rely
on
the
privacy
or
the
secrecy
of
union
premises
to
maintain
the
secrecy
of
his
criminal
activities,
any
more
than
that
the
defendant
in
the
louis
case,
decided
recently
by
this
court,
was
entitled
to
the
shelter
of
the
fourth
amendment
with
respect
to
using
his
home
as
a
base
for
criminal
activities.
i'd
like
to
just
deal
with
one
other
aspect
of
jones
which
i
think
respondent
laces
his
heaviest
reliance
on.
that
is
the
fact
that
the
respondent
here
was
on
the
premises
when
the
search
occurred
and
jones
says
--
this
court
said
in
jones,
that
an
individual
who
is
legitimately
on
the
premises
is
entitled
to
object
to
a
search
of
those
premises.
and
the
court
did
in
fact
say
that
and
this
respondent
was
in
fact
“legitimately
on
the
premises”.
i
nevertheless
urge
this
court
that
while
that
standard,
namely
the
“legitimately
on
premises”
test
may
be
a
sufficient
standard
to
test
searches
of
homes
or
as
in
the
case
of
jones,
apartments,
is
a
singularly
inappropriate
guideline
for
cases
involving
searches
of
premises
which
are
open
to
the
public.
and
particularly
in
cases
involving
searches
of
commercial
premises
which
are
open
to
the
public
in
which
employ
many
people.
in
such
cases,
unlike
cases
involving
searches
of
purely
private
premises,
the
mere
presence,
even
if
legitimate,
carries
with
it
no
implication
of
any
personal
right
of
privacy.
we
recognized
as
we
must
that
business
or
commercial
premises
may
be
entitled
to
the
protection
and
indeed
are
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
questioned
raised
by
this
case
is
on
who's
behalf
or
such
premises
constitutionally
protected.
it
is
our
position
and
we
urge
it
upon
this
court
that
the
“legitimately
on
the
premises”
test
dealing
with
a
--
what
was
in
substance
a
home
in
the
jones
case,
simply
doesn't
answer
this
question.
we
must
look
beyond
this
whether
or
not
the
objecting
defendant
is
legitimately
on
the
premises.
and
when
we
do
in
this
case,
we
submit
there
is
nothing
to
justify
the
court
of
appeals'
conclusion
that
the
search
of
these
premises
intruded
upon
the
inviolability
of
the
respondent's
person
or
upon
the
sanctity
of
his
home
or
upon
any
place
which
could
reasonably
be
considered
an
extension
of
his
person
or
home.
and
we
submit
that
it
is
this
test
which
must
be
answered
before
the
fourth
amendment
applies
in
this
case.
and
when
we
apply
this
kind
of
reasoning,
it
--
the
inclusion
of
the
second
circuit
that
the
respondent's
fourth
amendment
rights
were
invaded
by
the
search
is
unsupportable
and
we
urged
that
it
be
reversed.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
all
i
would
say
in
rebuttal
your
honors
is
that
the
issue
which
the
respondent
has
attempted
to
inject
indirectly
into
this
case,
namely
the
whole
question
of
standing
itself
is
one
that
was
not
briefed
below
and
i
can't
say
whether
it
was
argued
below
because
i
didn't
argue
in
the
case
below
myself,
but
it
was
not
--
neither
has
it
been
briefed
here.
i
would
not
consider
it
to
be
a
proper
subject
for
this
court's
decision
but
in
any
event
i
would
repeat
what
i
began
by
saying
in
answer
to
a
question
of
mr.
justice
fortas,
namely
that
standing
is
an
often
misused
word
which
i
take
to
be
a
shorthand
description
of
whether
or
not
the
objecting
individual's
fourth
amendment
rights
were
violated.
so,
it
seems
to
me
they
talk
in
terms
of
eliminating
any
standing
requirement
would
be
to
rewrite
the
fourth
amendment
and
i
would
consider
that
that's
not
something
were
interested
in
doing.
thank
you
very
much
your
honors.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
reserve
three
minutes
in
the
event
that
i
wish
to
rebut
your
honor.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
this
case
raises
the
question
whether
the
taking
of
union
records
from
union
premises
without
a
warrant
and
not
incident
to
an
arrest
violates
the
fourth
amendment
right
of
a
union
official
to
be
secure
in
his
person,
houses,
papers,
and
effects.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
complicated
and
they
are
not
in
dispute.
briefly,
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
the
respondent
has
never
raised
a
fifth
amendment
issue
as
such
your
honor.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
it's
our
position
as
i
--
and
i
will
get
to
that
shortly.
it's
very
difficult
to
separate
the
nature
of
fourth
amendment
rights
from
the
nature
of
fifth
amendment
rights
in
this
particular
case.
briefly,
the
facts
are
and
i
repeat,
they
are
not
in
dispute.
the
respondent
was
the
vice-president
of
a
local
teamsters
union
in
new
york
city.
he
was
indicted
by
nassau
county
grand
jury
in
1959,
along
with
two
other
union
officials
and
12
other
individuals.
they
were
charged
with
extortion,
coercion,
and
conspiracy
all
in
violation
of
the
new
york
penal
law.
the
substance
of
the
charge
of
the
indictment
was
that
the
defendants
were
using
the
local
union
as
a
tool
to
establish
an
illegal
monopoly
of
the
jukebox
and
gaming
machine
industry
in
the
metropolitan
new
york
city
area.
additionally,
that
they
were
--
through
the
mechanism
of
the
union,
extorting
from
owners
of
such
machines
--
money
from
owners
of
such
machines
by
compelling
payment
of
tribute
disguised
as
union
dues,
initiation
fees,
and
assessments.
shortly,
prior
to
the
return
of
this
indictment,
the
nassau
county
district
attorney
issued
a
subpoena
for
the
books
and
records
of
the
union,
calling
for
these
books
to
be
produced
at
the
district
attorney's
office.
this
subpoena
was
served
upon
--
served
at
the
union
offices
in
manhattan.
their
union
offices
i
believe
were
on
42nd
street
in
manhattan.
it's
been
stipulated
or
conceded
in
this
case
that
the
union
office
consisted
of
one
large
room
in
which
several
of
the
union
officials
and
employees
had
desk
including
the
respondent
in
this
case.
and
the
subpoena
was
served
at
a
time
when
the
respondent
was
present
in
these
offices,
other
people
were
also
present.
the
respondent
refused
to
comply
with
the
subpoena
and
upon
his
refusal
the
police
took
the
union
records
over
the
objection
of
the
respondent.
there
is
no
claim
that
any
of
these
records
were
taken
from
the
respondent's
person
or
from
his
desk
or
from
any
other
place
which
was
set
aside
for
his
personal
use,
nor
is
there
any
claim
that
any
of
his
personal
property
was
taken.
solely,
union
records
were
taken
and
these
included
such
things
as
minutes
of
union
meetings,
applications
of
prospective
members,
union
charter,
deposit
slips.
and
i
should
say
also
that
many
of
these
are
items
and
this
is
also
conceded
here,
many
of
these
items
were
at
least
in
part
prepared
by
the
respondent
here
in
his
role
as
an
officer
of
the
union.
and
again,
most
of
these
items,
a
large
portion
of
these
items
were
introduced
into
evidence
over
objection
at
the
trial
--
at
the
joint
trial
of
the
respondent
and
the
14
other
defendants.
the
respondent
was
--
i
should
add
that
that
trial
took
several
months.
the
respondent
was
convicted
in
1960.
his
appeals
in
the
new
york
state
courts
were
heard
after
this
court's
decision
in
mapp
against
ohio.
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeal
--
the
new
york
courts
considered
his
claims
that
his
fourth
amendment
rights
have
been
violated
by
the
taking
of
the
union
records.
and
they
held
that
the
search
and
seizure
of
the
union
records
did
not
violate
any
of
the
respondent's
fourth
amendment
rights.
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
196
--
in
october
of
1963
and
that
the
respondent
began
serving
his
sentence
of
three
to
five
years,
most
of
which
is
by
now
completed.
in
march
of
1966,
the
respondent
applied
to
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
new
york
for
a
federal
writ
of
habeas
corpus
claiming
among
other
things
and
this
is
the
only
claim
in
this
case
that
his
fourth
amendment
rights
have
been
violated
by
the
search
and
seizure
of
the
union
records.
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
unanimous
conclusion
of
the
new
york
courts
that
no
personal
rights
of
the
respondent
were
violated
by
the
search
and
seizure
of
the
union
records
and
denied
the
writ.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
reversed
and
issued
the
writ
and
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
january
to
review,
as
i
said
before,
the
question
of
whether
this
particular
search
and
seizure
violated
the
personal
fourth
amendment
rights
of
this
defendant
--
of
this
respondent,
to
be
secure
in
his
person,
houses,
papers
and
effects
which
is
the
language
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
language
which
this
court
has
said
many
times
since
the
19th
century
in
boyd
against
united
states,
that
the
purpose
of
this
language
was
to
protect
the
sanctity
of
a
man's
home
and
the
privacies
of
his
life
from
unreasonable
intrusions
by
the
government.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
that's
not
my
understanding
of
new
york
law,
no
your
honor.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
that's
what
happened
here
and
i
do
not
try
to
justify
what
happened
in
this
case
in
terms
of
a
proper
execution
of
the
subpoena
here.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
well
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
that
is
the
question
although
i
would
submit
that
the
term
standing
is
itself
a
shorthand
expression
for
a
description
of
whether
or
not
this
was
an
unlawful
search
in
terms
of
this
particular
individual's
fourth
amendment
rights.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
but
except
for
that,
what
you've
said
is
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
i
believe
so
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
is
our
position
here
that
the
respondent
has
failed
to
show
that
the
search
and
seizure
of
the
union
records
violated
his
personal
rights
either
in
terms
of
the
items
which
were
taken,
or
in
terms
of
the
place
from
which
they
were
taken.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
well,
it's
my
position
that
his
rights
are
no
different
if
that
had
been
what
happened.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
first,
with
respects
--
with
respect
to
the
items
that
were
taken,
that
is
with
respect
to
the
papers
and
effects
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
most
obvious
characteristic
of
these
records
is
that
they
did
not
belong
to
the
respondent
and
i
emphasize
that.
he
does
not
claim
that
they
did
nor
did
he
have
possession
of
these
records
in
any
sort
of
a
personal
capacity.
his
custody
and
it
appears
that
he
was
--
in
terms
of
his
union
role,
the
custodian
of
the
records,
his
custody
of
the
records
were
solely
in
his
capacity
as
a
union
official.
it's
our
position
as
mr.
justice
white
indicated
that
this
possession
in
this
capacity
gives
rise
to
no
personal
privilege
on
behalf
of
this
particular
respondent.
and
we
believe
the
court
has
so
held
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
white,
that
even
a
union
official
who
is
charged
with
the
custody
of
the
union
books
and
records,
has
no
legally
cognizable
personal
interest
in
such
records,
just
as
the
court
has
also
held
that
a
corporate
official
who
has
custody
of
corporate
records
has
no
legally
cognizable
interest
in
corporate
books
and
records.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
he
was
a
vice-president.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
no.
i
think
it
wouldn't.
i
don't
think
it
would
under
united
states
against
white.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
no,
i
think
we
can
assume
that
he
had
as
much
status
as
a
union
officer
could
ever
have
like
--
he
was
the
custodian
of
the
books.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
and
i
think
under
united
states
against
white
that's
irrelevant.
it's
our
position
in
the
absence
of
such
a
personal
interest
which
this
court
has
said
in
the
white
case,
this
respondent
does
not
have,
there
are
no
personal
fourth
amendment
rights
infringed
by
a
seizure.
this
is
--
this
we
believe
is
the
import
of
the
case
of
jones
against
united
states.
that
is
the
first
half
of
the
jones
case,
the
half
dealing
with
seized
items
as
opposed
to
the
half
of
the
jones
case
dealing
with
the
place
where
item
--
from
which
items
were
seized
which
i
will
get
to
shortly.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
i
would
assume
so.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
well,
i
have
foreseen
it
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
an
unincorporated
association
and
that
it
would
have
capacity
to
obtain
return
of
the
records.
it
is
possible
for
a
union
to
become
a
membership
corporation
under
new
york
law
but
i
don't
--
i
wouldn't
think
that
would
make
any
difference.
the
point
is
though
that
there
was
no
--
to
my
knowledge,
no
formal
effort
made
by
the
union
to
obtain
return
of
these
records.
the
respondent
seems
to
take
a
position
here
and
i
assume
the
second
circuit
took
the
same
position
that
there
is
something
about
the
case
of
jones
against
united
states
which
somehow
does
away
with
the
requirement
that
an
individual
objecting
to
a
search
and
seizure
demonstrate
some
personal
interest
in
the
items
seized.
we
believe
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
i
believe
that
that's
the
crux
of
the
second
circuit's
decision,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
well,
what's
wrong
with
that
is
the
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
well,
first
--
in
the
first
place,
factually
that's
not
entirely
correct.
he
was
one
of
15
defendants
that
was
indicted
and
tried
in
this
case,
so
although
they
presumably
were
after
him,
he's
not
the
only
one
they
were
after
and
i
frankly
don't
know
what
they
were
after
precisely
in
terms
of
what
they
thought
the
books
and
records
would
reveal
to
them.
secondly
and
most
importantly,
and
this
is
our
--
perhaps
most
fundamental
disagreement
with
the
conclusion
of
the
second
circuit.
we
don't
believe
that
the
personal
rights
of
this
respondent
or
of
anyone
who
has
custody
of
records
or
indeed
of
anyone
else
should
be
determined
by
whether
or
not
he
happens
to
be
a
suspect
in
the
minds
of
the
police.
i
think
there's
almost
no
other
way
to
read
the
second
circuit
decision
and
there
--
that
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
kind
of
personal
rights
that
the
fourth
amendment
we
believe
was
designed
to
protect,
either
he
had
them
or
he
didn't.
and
the
fact
that
he
was
a
suspect,
it
seems
to
us
is
irrelevant.
and
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
i
think
not.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
what
you
mean
by
his
entries.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
he
kept
the
books
as
--
in
his
role
as
a
union
official.
the
entries
that
were
in
the
bankbooks
are
--
for
example,
he
signed
most
of
the
checks.
he
cosigned
most
of
the
checks.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
i
would
assume
not.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
that's
our
position.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
that's
our
position
and
we
believe
that
united
states
against
white
for
example
supports
it.
we
also
believe
that
the
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
we
also
believe
that
the
jones
case
supports
it,
except
in
the
narrow
areas
of
possessory
crimes
which
this
is
not.
jones
retained
the
assumption
that
an
individual
objecting
to
the
seizure
of
property
had
to
demonstrate
a
personal
interest
in
the
property
seized.
all
jones
did
and
it
is
our
position,
is
create
an
exception
in
those
cases
where
the
defendant
was
charged
with
a
possessory
crime.
and
the
reason,
i
should
point
this
out
here,
the
reason
for
the
exception
is
i
read
it
in
jones
is
because
of
the
intrinsic
unfairness
of
placing
a
defendant
charge
with
a
possessory
crime
in
a
position
of
having
to
prove
his
own
possession
in
order
to
object
to
the
seizure
of
the
item
possessed.
we
would
submit
that
jones
goes
no
further
than
this
in
dispensing
with
the
necessity
of
showing
personal
interest
in
the
property
seized.
but
even
more
in
the
light
of
this
court's
recent
decision
in
the
simmons
case,
i
would
seriously
--
which
i
take
it
solves
most
of
the
dilemma
which
that
aspect
of
the
jones
case
was
designed
to
meet.
there's
certainly
no
reason
for
expanding
this
aspect
of
jones
which
by
its
own
terms
was
limited
to
possessory
crimes.
i
just
would
like
to
reemphasize
that
it's
the
impersonal
character
of
the
books
which
refutes
the
fifth
amendment
as
well
as
the
fourth
amendment
privilege
in
this
case.
the
same
reasoning
which
would
refute
the
fifth
amendment
privilege,
we
submit
should
refute
the
fourth
amendment
privilege.
and
this
is
without
regard
to
the
fact
the
respondent
here
participated
in
the
preparation
of
these
books
and
his
role
as
a
union
official.
we
believe
that
the
same
reasoning
which
this
court
has
used
to
say
that
his
custody
of
the
books
and
records
as
a
union
official
gives
rise
to
no
personal
privilege
would
apply
to
the
fact
the
he
may
have
prepared
these
books
and
records.
but
the
point
is
that
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
i'm
not
--
had
been
a
legal
seizure
in
that
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
well
presumably,
we
wouldn't
be
here
if
that
had
been
the
case.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
well
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
i
don't
want
to
be
in
a
position
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
i
don't
want
to
be
in
a
position
of
defending
the
second
circuit's
decision
mr.
justice
white.
i
don't
believe
that
that's
--
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
--
at
least,
i
don't
read
it
as
saying
that
either
a
warrant
couldn't
issue
or
the
subpoena
be
enforced
in
the
normal
way
under
white.
i
don't
believe
it
intended
at
least
to
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
well
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
this
--
i
under
--
i
see
what
you're
getting
at
and
this
indeed
is
what
we
are
getting
at,
that
is
that
the
rationale
for
the
denial
of
the
privilege
under
white,
namely
the
character
of
the
books,
his
lack
of
any
personal
relationship
to
them
in
the
sense
that
it
does
not
--
they
do
not
involve
any
element
of
the
privacies
of
his
life.
that
same
rationale
and
it
is
our
position
that
it
would,
that
same
rationale
should
deny
the
fourth
amendment
privilege.
so
in
that
sense,
i
suppose
that
the
--
logically,
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
would
undercut
the
reasoning
if
--
and
indeed
the
result
of
the
white
case.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
i
think
it
turns
on
that
fact
as
well
as
on
the
fact
as
mr.
justice
marshall
observed
that
the
search
was
directed
at
this
defendant.
but
our
problem
with
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
this
is
why
were
here
is
because
we
believed
that
that
decision
ignored
the
rationale
for
the
white
case
and
by
making
the
statement
which
you
just
referred
to
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
--
we
believe
that
undermines
the
rationale
of
the
white
case.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
that
sort
of
beside
the
point,
what
they
said
there.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
yes,
i
do
believe
that.
and
i
also
believe
that
the
fourth
--
the
second
circuit
merely
assumed
from
one,
the
fact
that
there
was
no
warrant,
and
two,
the
fact
that
the
search
was
directed
against
this
particular
respondent
that
it
automatically
violated
the
fourth
amendment.
i
think
it
ignored
this
substance
of
the
rights
which
the
fourth
amendment
protects
and
in
doing
so,
i
think
it
also
ignored
the
rationale
of
the
white
decision.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
--
at
least
under
the
white
decision,
that
the
books
and
records
themselves
were
not
privileged
on
behalf
of
this
individual.
and
the
only
way
then
that
the
respondent
could
legitimately
claim
that
his
fourth
amendment
rights
were
violated
by
the
search,
is
if
he
comes
within
the
persons
or
houses
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment.
at
the
outset,
we
recognized
as
the
courts
observed
in
the
katz
case
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
people
and
not
places.
but
it
is
important
here
to
emphasize
that
this
case
does
not
involve
in
any
sense
the
search
of
a
person
or
of
any
place
set
aside
for
the
respondent's
personal
use.
therefore,
it
does
not
involve
as
such
the
security
of
the
respondent's
person,
nor
obviously
does
it
involve
a
search
of
his
home.
and
it's
at
this
point
that
we
get
to
the
second
aspect
of
the
court's
decision
in
jones,
namely
whether
the
respondent
has
shown
that
he
had
a
legally
requisite
interest
in
the
premises
in
order
to
claim
that
an
intrusion
into
those
premises
intruded
into
his
fourth
amendment
rights.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
well,
i
just
--
we
just
went
through
that.
they
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
they
--
what
they
did
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
alright,
i
have
it
at
page
--
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
it's
page
41
of
the
appendix
at
the
--
in
the
footnote.
the
jones
case,
this
court
held
in
substance
that
defendant
who
was
entitled
to
use
his
friend's
apartment
who
had
free
access
to
that
apartment
was
entitled
to
believe
that
the
sanctity
of
the
home
and
privacies
of
life
extended
to
this
place
which
was
in
effect
an
extension
of
his
home.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
basis
in
this
record
for
concluding
that
the
union
premises
were
such
a
private
place
that
in
terms
of
the
fourth
amendment,
it
was
tantamount
to
an
extension
of
the
respondent's
home.
there
was
nothing
certainly
to
entitle
him
to
consider
the
union
premises
as
a
private
personal
enclave.
there's
nothing
inherently
private
about
these
offices.
he
shared
this
one
large
room
with
other
people
and
it
presumably
was
open
to
the
public.
the
use
of
this
office
was
limited
to
his
function
as
an
officer
of
the
institution.
and
here,
i
would
submit
that
the
same
rationale
which
denies
him
privileges
and
personal
privileges
in
the
books
also
denies
him
personal
privileges
in
the
premises
themselves.
he
should
no
more
have
a
personal
right
in
the
premises
because
he
has
a
right
as
a
--
in
his
capacity
as
a
union
official
to
be
there,
then
he
should
have
a
personal
right
in
the
books
because
he
has
a
right
in
his
capacity
as
a
union
official
to
retain
custody
of
the
books.
i
should
say
that
the
only
really
personal
activities
that
the
defendant
is
trying
to
claim
were
secluded
here
or
his
criminal
activities
which
were
used
by
which
he
used
the
union
as
a
façade
for
engaging
in
various
criminal
activities.
and
we
would
submit
that
there
is
no
more
fourth
amendment
right
to
rely
on
the
privacy
or
the
secrecy
of
union
premises
to
maintain
the
secrecy
of
his
criminal
activities,
any
more
than
that
the
defendant
in
the
louis
case,
decided
recently
by
this
court,
was
entitled
to
the
shelter
of
the
fourth
amendment
with
respect
to
using
his
home
as
a
base
for
criminal
activities.
i'd
like
to
just
deal
with
one
other
aspect
of
jones
which
i
think
respondent
laces
his
heaviest
reliance
on.
that
is
the
fact
that
the
respondent
here
was
on
the
premises
when
the
search
occurred
and
jones
says
--
this
court
said
in
jones,
that
an
individual
who
is
legitimately
on
the
premises
is
entitled
to
object
to
a
search
of
those
premises.
and
the
court
did
in
fact
say
that
and
this
respondent
was
in
fact
“legitimately
on
the
premises”.
i
nevertheless
urge
this
court
that
while
that
standard,
namely
the
“legitimately
on
premises”
test
may
be
a
sufficient
standard
to
test
searches
of
homes
or
as
in
the
case
of
jones,
apartments,
is
a
singularly
inappropriate
guideline
for
cases
involving
searches
of
premises
which
are
open
to
the
public.
and
particularly
in
cases
involving
searches
of
commercial
premises
which
are
open
to
the
public
in
which
employ
many
people.
in
such
cases,
unlike
cases
involving
searches
of
purely
private
premises,
the
mere
presence,
even
if
legitimate,
carries
with
it
no
implication
of
any
personal
right
of
privacy.
we
recognized
as
we
must
that
business
or
commercial
premises
may
be
entitled
to
the
protection
and
indeed
are
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
questioned
raised
by
this
case
is
on
who's
behalf
or
such
premises
constitutionally
protected.
it
is
our
position
and
we
urge
it
upon
this
court
that
the
“legitimately
on
the
premises”
test
dealing
with
a
--
what
was
in
substance
a
home
in
the
jones
case,
simply
doesn't
answer
this
question.
we
must
look
beyond
this
whether
or
not
the
objecting
defendant
is
legitimately
on
the
premises.
and
when
we
do
in
this
case,
we
submit
there
is
nothing
to
justify
the
court
of
appeals'
conclusion
that
the
search
of
these
premises
intruded
upon
the
inviolability
of
the
respondent's
person
or
upon
the
sanctity
of
his
home
or
upon
any
place
which
could
reasonably
be
considered
an
extension
of
his
person
or
home.
and
we
submit
that
it
is
this
test
which
must
be
answered
before
the
fourth
amendment
applies
in
this
case.
and
when
we
apply
this
kind
of
reasoning,
it
--
the
inclusion
of
the
second
circuit
that
the
respondent's
fourth
amendment
rights
were
invaded
by
the
search
is
unsupportable
and
we
urged
that
it
be
reversed.
mr.
michael
h.
rauch
all
i
would
say
in
rebuttal
your
honors
is
that
the
issue
which
the
respondent
has
attempted
to
inject
indirectly
into
this
case,
namely
the
whole
question
of
standing
itself
is
one
that
was
not
briefed
below
and
i
can't
say
whether
it
was
argued
below
because
i
didn't
argue
in
the
case
below
myself,
but
it
was
not
--
neither
has
it
been
briefed
here.
i
would
not
consider
it
to
be
a
proper
subject
for
this
court's
decision
but
in
any
event
i
would
repeat
what
i
began
by
saying
in
answer
to
a
question
of
mr.
justice
fortas,
namely
that
standing
is
an
often
misused
word
which
i
take
to
be
a
shorthand
description
of
whether
or
not
the
objecting
individual's
fourth
amendment
rights
were
violated.
so,
it
seems
to
me
they
talk
in
terms
of
eliminating
any
standing
requirement
would
be
to
rewrite
the
fourth
amendment
and
i
would
consider
that
that's
not
something
were
interested
in
doing.
thank
you
very
much
your
honors.
