the
(voice

--
justice
potter

alright,
fine.
that's
fine,
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
so
he
can
--
it
was
a
--
the
corporation,
the
union
--
a
corporation
or
an
unincorporated
association?
justice
potter
stewart
unincorporated
association?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
is
no
question
that
the
--
what
was
seized
here
were
--
was
the
property
of
the
union.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
question
about
that,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it
was
the
effects
of
the
union.
now,
can
a
non
--
does
the
fourth
amendment
by
its
terms
protect
an
unincorporated
association
from
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure?
justice
potter
stewart
the
fourth
amendment
says
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secured
and
that
persons
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart

and
effect
shall
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
included
--
it's
one
of
the
people,
is
it
under
the
fourth
amendment
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
an
unincorporated
association.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
corporation?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
probably
right,
i
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
silverthorne
arose
in
a
different
way.
it
was
as
contempt
proceeding
when
the
corporation
and
its
officers
refused
to
turnover
to
--
in
obedience
to
a
subpoena,
the
corporate
books
and
records.
and
as
justice
holmes'
opinion
indicates
the
--
that
subpoena
was
in
turn
grounded
upon
a
secret
unlawful
search
of
the
corporation's
premises.
therefore,
it
was
an
unlawful
subpoena
and
it
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
admission
of
evidence
either
against
the
corporation
or
against
the
corporate
officers.
it
simply
was
the
reversal
of
their
contempt
convictions
because
they
said
that
they
were
entitled
to
resist
an
unlawful
search.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
was
a
corporation
here
and
the
corporation's
officers,
they
were
making
the
objection
with
respect
to
the
seizure
of
corporate
records
to
be
used
against
the
corporation.
