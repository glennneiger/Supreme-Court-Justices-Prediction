justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
no
fifth
amendment
issue
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
i
gather
that
--
that's
to
say
we
can
treat
it
as
if
there
were
no
subpoena
in
the
case
at
all?
the
police
had
just
gotten
in
and
grabbed
these
books
and
brought
them
in
would
still
have
the
same
issue
here
as
you
see
it
we
have
in
the
presence
of
the
subpoena?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
that
--
do
i
correctly
read
it
that
court
of
appeals
of
saying
that
had
this
been
a
legal
seizure
than
under
white,
this
respondent
would
have
had
no
basis
to
complain,
is
that
right?
but
that
because
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
had
the
(voice
overlap)
--
the
materials
had
been
legally
obtained?
is
that
what
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
--
what
i'm
--
i
was
trying
to
figure
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
follow
that,
not
if
i
read
--
get
the
correct
import
of
what
i'm
about
to
read
to
you,
page
34
from
the
opinion,
this
still
was
of
course
was
a
privilege
but
nevertheless,
it
said
that,
“if
these
materials
had
been
legally
obtained,
the
fourth's
--
fifth
amendment
right
against
self-incrimination
would
not
have
prevented
this
evidence
of
being
used
against
him,”
relying
in
white.
but
then,
goes
on
to
say
by
then,
“unlawful
search
cannot
be
justified
on
the
ground
that
the
evidence
seized
might
have
been
obtained
by
other
unlawful
means.”
what
i'm
at
--
my
question
to
you
is,
is
this
all
turned
in
the
court
of
appeals'
view
on
the
fact
that
as
they
saw
it,
these
materials
were
not
legally
seized.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
think
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
whether
or
not
the
privilege
is
involved
or
a
fourth
amendment
right
is
involved,
the
same
result
should
follow
under
white.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
its
34,
just
in
the
footnote
in
the
petitioner's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they've
dealt
with
it
only
in
the
footnote,
that's
the
only
record
presented
with
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
mean
in
judge
kaufman's
opinion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
could
i
ask
you
--
do
you
think
white
has
an
issue
with
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
white
said
--
the
opinion
in
white
says
that
he
relies
upon
the
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
explicit
guarantee
of
the
fifth
amendment.
we
all
know
that
neither
the
fourth
amendment
nor
the
fifth
amendment
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
gather
you
mean,
aimed
at
illegal
searches
and
seizures,
you
mean
specifically
in
the
context
of
the
deterrence,
the
mapp
rule?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
deterrence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
deterrence
against
the
--
committing
illegal
searches
and
seizures.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
you
answer
mr.
justice
harlan
earlier
that
you
--
contempt
with
an
affirmance
here
on
the
premises
of
the
court
of
appeals,
am
i
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
you
tell
me
about
those
premises
are,
i'm
--
swear
cannot
understand.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
see
are
you
saying
that
what
they
really
said,
this
falls
within
the
rationale
of
jones
because
the
search
was
directed
really
at
him
and
not
at
the
union?
are
they
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--and
then
invaded
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
some
personal
right
of
privacy
of
his
and
that
he
was
on
the
premises
when
the
search
and
seizure
occurred.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
is
that
--
is
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
told
us
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me,
do
you
think
this
case
would
be
any
--
this
chap
was
convicted
for
extortion,
was
he
among
other
things?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
suppose
what
had
happened
here
had
not
happened
in
respect
of
the
union's
books,
but
of
the
books
of
one
of
the
companies
from
whom
--
from
which
he
was
charged
with
having
extorted
moneys.
and
they
took
the
books
in
precisely
the
same
way.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no,
no,
at
the
office
of
the
company
from
which
was
the
victim
of
the
extortion.
and
in
those
books
was
the
evidence
that
indeed
he
had
extorted
from
that
company.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they
were
seized
but
--
illegally
just
as
found
it
here
that
they
were.
would
you
be
taking
any
different
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
that's
where
your
deterrence
--
theory
takes
you
though
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
wondering
if
the
court
of
appeals,
i
suppose
you
must
have
urged
this
below.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
didn't
they
buy
your
deterrence
argument
really?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
must
say,
i
can't
read
that
opinion
of
judge
kaufman's.
stopping
much,
very
sure
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
there's
an
affirmance
in
that
they
held?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.

no
fifth
amendment
issue
here.
