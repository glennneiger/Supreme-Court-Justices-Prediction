justice
abe
fortas
apart
from
the
question
of
whether
the
respondent
has
standing
to
assert
the
fourth
amendment
infirmity
here,
do
you
concede
that
the
seizure
of
the
books
pursuant
to
a
subpoena
was
unlawful?
what
is
the
new
york
law
in
that
they
are
--
if
the
police
were
given
a
subpoena
to
serve,
they
go
to
a
place
and
the
person
refuses
to
turnover
the
books
called
forth
by
the
subpoena,
remember,
we're
not
talking
about
a
search
warrant.have
the
police
got
the
authority
to
take
the
books
and
bring
them
in?
justice
abe
fortas
but
that's
what
happened
here,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
so
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
that
is
conceded,
they
are
clearly
the
unlawful
use
--
the
unlawful
seizure
of
books
pursuant
to
a
legal
paper,
a
subpoena
that
did
not
authorize
the
seizure
of
the
books?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
question
is
whether
this
respondent
has
standing
to
assert
the
infirmity,
am
i
right?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i
agree.
i
think
the
word
standing
is
subject
to
some
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
your
client
had
absolutely
no
connection
with
the
union,
but
there
was
something
in
the
unlawfully
seized
union
books
that
the
state
proposed
to
use
against
him
in
a
criminal
prosecution,
by
your
analysis
would
that
difference
make
any
difference
in
result?
justice
abe
fortas
but
he
wasn't
employed
the
by
the
union
at
all
but
there's
a
check,
let's
say
a
book
showing
--
show
that
a
payment
was
made
to
mr.
deforte
or
whatever
his
name
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
all.
he
has
no
other
connection
with
the
union.
he's
just
--
was
a
supplier
of
goods,
let's
say.
and
the
state
wanted
to
use
that
evidence
and
the
--
would
he
be
able
to
assert
in
defense
that
the
books
were
illegally
seized
from
the
union.
i'm
trying
to
get
the
extent
to
which
you
would
carry
your
theory.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
they're
the
victim,
they
get
hurt.
presumably,
this
evidence
of
the
books
are
very
harmful
to
them,
that's
why
the
state
wants
to
use
it
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
so
then
you
say
that
we
were
hurt
that
i
--
he
could
say
he
was
hurt
by
the
unlawful
seizure
of
these
books.
justice
abe
fortas
that
you
rest
on
that
proposition,
that's
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
i'm
trying
to
find
out.
