mr.
james
l.
lekin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
james
l.
lekin
and
i
am
assigned
counsel
for
the
respondent
(inaudible)
for
the
district
court
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
yes,
your
honor.
your
honor,
the
illegality
of
the
search
is
not
in
question.
the
respondent
takes
three
avenues
of
approach.
number
one,
jones
versus
united
states
gives
respondent
standing.
number
two,
silverthorne
lumber
company
versus
the
united
states
also
gives
standing.
and
then
number
three
and
i
think
this
is
important,
i
think
that
the
whole
concept
of
standing
perhaps
should
be
reexamined
by
the
court.
i
do
not
intend
at
this
time
to
do
so
unless
the
court
wants
to.
but
i
suggest
it
for
this
reason,
that
in
the
case
of
simmons
versus
the
united
states,
which
was
just
handed
down
approximately
one
month
ago
in
footnote
12,
involving
the
question
of
hearing
evidence
and
allowing
evidence
on
standing
to
go
into
trial.
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
that
the
question
of
standing
perhaps
was
examinable
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
linkletter
versus
walker
was
predicated
upon
deterrence.
approximately
10
days
ago
and
after
i
had
submitted
my
brief
to
this
court
that
i
saw
this
case,
but
i
refer
the
court
to
footnote
25
of
my
brief
which
says,
“in
which
i
argued
before
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
on
a
response
to
a
direct
question
by
judge
kaufman
who
wrote
the
opinion,
that
counsel
for
the
respondent
suggest
that
because
the
fourth
amendment
is
based
on
deterrence
rather
than
self-incrimination,
a
complete
examination
of
the
"on
the
premises"
test
and
the
standing
question
is
an
order”.
this
is
also
predicated
upon
linkletter
versus
walker.
and
in
this
same
footnote,
i
cited
the
same
footnote
--
i
cited
the
same
law
review
article
that
mr.
justice
harlan
had
cited.
i
don't
know
how
far
the
court
wants
me
to
get
into
this
because
that
has
not
been
thoroughly
briefed,
but
i
think
it
has
absolute
merit.
and
i
say
this
for
this
reason,
that
i
have
been
with
this
case
for
approximately
two
years
and
i
have
nothing
--
i've
had
nothing
but
to
occupy
my
time
in
the
issue
standing
outside
of
the
private
practice
of
law.
and
that
it
seems
to
me,
there
is
great
grounds
to
employ
standing
anymore
if
we're
going
to
have
the
deterrence
rationale.
because
if
deterrence
is
the
jugular
vein
of
the
fourth
amendment.
then
a
--
if
a
no
legal
search
and
seizure
occurs,
then
why
is
it
necessary
to
require
someone
who
have
a
possessory
interest
or
proprietary
interest
in
the
thing
seized
or
the
premises
searched.
and
i
will
end
it
at
that
and
if
the
court
wishes
to
pursue
it,
i
will
respond.
as
it
is
now,
respondent
comes
before
this
court
and
seeks
the
suppression
of
an
outright
illegal
search
and
seizure
of
union
books
and
records.
this
search
and
seizure
was
conducted
without
any
authority
and
the
respondent
in
answering
the
request
in
the
question
of
mr.
justice
brennan
does
not
rely
on
the
fifth
amendment.
i
don't
see
how
we
can
rely
on
the
fifth
amendment
because
i
think
white,
united
states
versus
white
and
wilson
preclude
our
reliance
on
the
fifth
amendment.
and
i
think
an
answer
to
your
question
your
honor,
at
footnote
9,
i
think
the
court
is
saying
perhaps
(inaudible).
mr.
james
l.
lekin
yes,
in
judge
kaufman's
opinion.
and
this
bothered
the
court
very
much
by
the
way
and
it
bothered
me
as
well,
that
if
you
have
for
instance,
a
situation
where
you
have
no
fifth
amendment
right,
what
happens
in
relationship
to
the
fourth
amendment?
and
of
course,
at
the
time
that
this
was
argued
and
at
the
present
time
right
now,
i
think
it
presents
to
some
extent
a
question
that
must
be
answered,
i
think
the
answer
is
obvious
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
no.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
your
honor,
i
think
it
has
nothing
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
alright,
to
answer
your
question,
i
think
that
the
fifth
amendment
--
white
and
wilson
have
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
fourth
amendment
in
this
particular
instance
and
i
have
explained
this
on
page
18
of
my
brief
as
well
as
i
can.
the
reason
i
don't
think
it
hasn't
anything
to
do
with
it
is
because
the
purposes
of
the
amendments
are
different.
the
fourth
is
aimed
at
preventing
a
legal
searches
and
seizures.
the
fifth
is
obviously
aimed
at
preventing
self-incrimination
which
goes
back
to
the
(inaudible)
proceedings
and
i
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
specifically,
in
the
terms
of
police
or
federal
authorities
going
into
whatever
it
might
be
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
that's
right.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
that's
right.
and
i
think
to
answer
your
question
to
pursue
it
even
further,
that's
why
--
in
this
instance,
if
the
court
is
going
to
determine
standing
for
--
prevails,
if
it's
going
to
require
standing,
i
think
the
court
really
has
to
take
a
look
at
what
standing
means
and
what
the
whole
rationale
of
personal
major
means.
what
does
the
victimization
test
of
jones
require
and
what
does
directed
at
it
--
require.
because
it's
beyond
me,
how
you
can
have
an
illegal
search
and
seizure
or
have
a
search
and
seizure
that
is
questioned.
and
say,
in
linkletter
and
infer
it
back
in
the
mapp
and
go
beyond
that
with
the
idea
of
preventing
authorities
from
going
into
homes
or
businesses
or
whatever
it
might
be
and
saying,
"we
don't
want
the
police
to
doing
this
and
we're
going
to
remove
every
incentive
there
is
because
we're
not
going
to
allow
the
evidences
if
they
violate
this".
and
then
at
the
same
time,
require,
for
instance
someone
to
come
in
and
say
that
they
have
to
have
a
proprietary
interest
or
they
have
to
be
on
the
premises.
for
instance,
when
we're
talking
about
jones
which
was
decided
in
1960
in
the
famous
quote
of,
“anyone
legitimately
on
that
premises
may
attack
a
search
and
seizure”.
right
there,
i
think
it
breaks
down
to
some
extent
because
you
can
have
somebody
that's
off
the
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
i
certainly
would
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
i'm
not
asking
you
to
go
that
far
your
honor.
i
--
and
i'm
not
asking
you
to
go
that
far
at
all.
and
i
will
be
satisfied
and
i
think
that
this
court
under
the
authority
of
jones
versus
united
states
hasn't
--
has
more
than
enough
because
the
respondent
meets
both
the
test.
i
think
he
was
clearly
the
victim,
and
second
of
all,
he
was
on
the
premises
when
the
search
and
seizure
occurred
and
he
objected
to
the
search
and
seizure.
and
so
i
don't
ask
that
this
court
completely
rule
out
standing,
if
they
don't
want
to.but
i
simply
say
that
there
is
merit
in
the
argument.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
well,
i
say
that
it's
no
good
in
the
light
of
united
states
versus
white,
it
looks
like
in
wilson,
because
there
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
because
--
i'm
not
agreeing
with
this
now.
but
i'm
simply
saying
that
the
authority
is
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
in
--
my
position
in
--
is
inconsistent
--
no,
i
don't.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
well,
because
i
assume
that
based
upon
these
two
cases,
that
he
has
no
fifth
amendment
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
well,
that's
a
good
question
your
honor,
because
the
case
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
the
case
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
oh,
i
don't
think
--
no,
no.
i
don't
think
it
does.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
well,
because
i
think
wilson
and
white
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
what
reason
is
there?
mr.
james
l.
lekin
well,
because
they're
saying
that
he's
required
because
--
the
--
as
an
officer,
if
hides
behind
the
façade
of
a
corporation
or
a
union
and
is
required
to
keep
books
and
records
that
the
fifth
amendment
is
a
personal
right
and
therefore
he
is
not
allowed
to
keep
it.
and
it
goes
back
to
the
rationale
of
the
fifth
amendment
being
a
personal
right.
and
i
take
it
that
the
state
has
tried
to
incorporate
this
same
argument
by
saying
the
fourth
amendment
is
personal.
my
point
is
that
the
two
amendments
are
recognizing
boyd
versus
the
united
states
in
recognizing
what
was
considered
to
be
an
interplay
at
the
time
that
the
case
was
decided.
and
going
back
to
entick
versus
carrington
and
all
subsequent
cases
after
boyd,
recognizing
that
the
interplay
existed,
are
they
dependent
upon
each
other?
and
i
don't
think
they
are
dependent
on
each
other.
i
think
boyd
or
mapp
points
it
out,
i
think
schmerber
makes
that
very
obviously,
schmerber
versus
california.
and
therefore,
at
the
time
your
honor,
because
it's
my
opinion
that
he
doesn't
have
a
fifth
amendment
right,
he
does
have
the
fourth
amendment
right
because
we're
talking
about
an
illegal
search
and
seizure.
we're
not
talking
about
the
serving
of
the
subpoena
and
the
refusal
to
do
it.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
that's
right.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
well,
the
--
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals,
what
--
i
think
we
have
to
go
back
to
jones,
what
does
jones
say?
jones
was
of
course
predicated
upon
a
possessorary
crime
of
narcotics.
and
the
courts
said,
twofold,
that
where
there
is
possession
in
the
charges
basic
in
that,
you
need
not
--
you're
not
required
to
assert
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
sense
of
standing.
it
also
assess
even
were
that
--
even
whether
or
not
this,
a
prosecution,
predicated
upon
possession
and
that
goes
on
and
says,
“anyone
legitimately
on
the
premises,
may
assert
the
fourth
amendment”.
and
i
think
it
was
on
this
case
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
jones.
now,
jones
at
the
very
inception
of
the
case,
says,
“that
in
order
--
that
a
person
must
be
a
victim.
that
is
the
person
must
be
against
whom
the
search
is
directed
--“
mr.
james
l.
lekin
i
don't
think
--
--
there's
no
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
--
question
about
it.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
well,
of
course
the
question
of
personal
privacy
becomes
the
ultimate
result
but
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
i
think
so
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
saying
that
deforte
is
a
respondent
--
was
the
victim
of
a
search
and
seizure.
in
other
words,
when
the
state
of
new
york
went
in
and
seized
these
books
and
records,
there
were
many
factors
that
indicated
that
he
--
and
not
just
the
union,
was
the
victim.
those
factors
were
this.
number
one,
monitors
had
been
placed
on
the
telephone.
number
two,
there
were
wiretaps.
number
three,
by
extinguishing
the
respondent
as
well
as
the
other
two
union
officers,
the
union
really
ceases
to
exist
because
you
incarcerate
these
people
if
you
can
convict
them
and
the
only
way
that
you
start
up
the
illegal
activities
again
is
to
either
do
one
or
two
things.
you
bring
in
new
officers,
or
you
get
the
same
officers
to
comeback
and
start
at
the
same
operation
again.
and
i
think
in
this
light,
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
"directed
at"
test.
in
other
words,
as
i
read
justice
frankfurter
in
his
decision
in
jones,
he
says
that
he
must
be
the
victim.
that
is
against
whom
the
search
and
seizure
is
directed
in
order
to
qualify
as
a
person
aggrieved.
and
as
in
--
and
is
--
in
this
sense
and
in
this
context
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
applied
jones
to
meet
this
requirement.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
an
unincorporated
association.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
that's
right.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
no,
there
isn't.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
alright.
do
you
mean
as
far
--
well,
are
you
talking
about
protecting
the
unincorporated
association
or
its
officers
or
both?
mr.
james
l.
lekin
i
think
that
obviously
it
does.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
yes
they
do.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
i
would
say
so
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
silverthorne
lumber
company
decided
in
1920
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
--
protects
corporations,
why
wouldn't
it
protect
the
union.
there's
no
reason
in
the
world
that
it
wouldn't
protect
a
union.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
if
i
understand
your
question,
for
instance
if
he
were
just
a
janitor
of
the
union
or
if
he
were
an
employee.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
deforte,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
if
i
were
arguing
for
that
position,
you
would
have
to
extend
jones
quite
a
length.
you
would
have
to
--
i
think
examine
whether
or
not
you're
going
to
have
the
standing
requirement.
i
think
what
you're
asking
is
can
really
anybody
raise
the
fourth
amendment
if
number
one,
you're
not
the
victim
and
possibly,
number
two,
they're
not
in
the
premises.
and
in
that
example,
i
would
think
that
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
yes,
but
the
problem
with
that
is
your
honor,
that
--
i
think
what
you're
asking
is
this.
in
order
to
qualify
as
person
agreed
by
an
unlawful
search
and
seizure,
one
must
have
been
the
victim
of
a
search
and
seizure.
one
against
whom
the
search
was
directed
as
distinguished
from
one
who
claims
prejudice.
now
i
suppose
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
well,
i'm
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
i'm
afraid
that
that's
what
jones
says
and
i
interpret
that
to
mean
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
yes,
i
realize
that.
but
of
course
rule
41
incorporated
many
aspects
of
what
they
thought
they
were
conforming
the
constitutional
standards.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
extortion,
and
a
number
of
other
things,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
you
mean
at
the
union
office?
mr.
james
l.
lekin
yes.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
no,
of
course
i
would
be
--
i'd
have
to
argue
much
strong
because
number
one,
he
wouldn't
be
on
the
premises.
and
number
two,
i
would
have
to
meet
justice
fortas'
question
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
a
victim
instead
of
whether
it
was
prejudice?
mr.
james
l.
lekin
that's
right,
it
is
your
honor
and
that's
why
i
suggested
at
the
very
inception
of
this
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
yes,
i
did.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
we
didn't
discuss
it
very
much
your
honor
because
at
that
point,
i
was
trying
to
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
your
honor,
i'm
here
to
of
course
affirm
the
decision
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
that's
right.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
and
i'm
here
for
the
court
to
examine
or
ask
the
court
to
examine
the
decision
obviously.
but
judge
kaufman
of
course
accepted
my
argument
at
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
filed
a
very
detailed
brief
of
45
pages
that
really
went
into
this
quite
thoroughly
as
to
with
jones,
because
jones
at
that
time,
in
silverthorne
were
like
two
main
attacks.
i
thought
jones
apply
because
i
thought
obviously
that
deforte
was
the
victim.
i
thought
he
was
the
person
against
whom
the
search
was
directed,
and
secondly,
he
clearly
met
the
“on
the
premises”
test
which
has
been
cited
and
cited
again
by
this
court
as
being
a
relaxation
of
the
standing
requirement
and
it
was
on
those
two
premises
that
--
of
course
the
court
made
their
determination.
now,
in
their
brief
--
in
the
written
opinion,
the
court
did
not
deal
with
my
silverthorne
argument
because
of
course
they
didn't
have
to.
they
did
--
they
reached
it
via
jones
and
they
felt
that
it
was
unnecessary
and
they
were
correct
in
doing
so.
but
i'm
urging
this
court
to
affirm
on
three
grounds,
either
on
jones,
if
we're
going
to
keep
the
standing
requirement
which
i
assume
probably
will
be
kept.
secondly,
silverthorne
lumber
company
which
i've
laid
out
in
my
brief,
i
think
again
is
another
ground.but
third
of
all,
if
the
court
is
interested
and
i
don't
--
and
i
do
not
urge
the
court
to
do
this,
and
i
say
that
it
is
not
required
to,
but
if
the
court
is
interested
in
discussing
standing,
and
i
only
say
this
in
light
of
the
reference
that
mr.
justice
harlan
made
in
the
simmons
case,
because
in
that
footnote,
it
says
that
it
is
suggested
that
perhaps
we
should
do
--
we
should
reconsider
the
standing
requirement,
and
that's
why
i
began
my
argument
on
those
premises.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
no,
he
didn't
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
this
case
presents
grounds
to
examine
it
if
the
court
wants
to.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
silverthorne
lumber
company
was
decided
in
1920.
it's
a
very
short
opinion
written
by
justice
holmes.
and
in
silverthorne,
basically
what
happened
was
that
there
was
an
illegal
search
and
seizure
of
corporate
books
and
records.
the
books
and
records
were
copied
by
the
federal
government.
they
were
then
returned
to
the
company
in
its
officers.
thereafter
the
government,
through
a
subpoena
sought
to
obtain
the
originals
of
the
same
records
for
indictment
purposes
i
suppose.
they've
refused.
i
say
they,
i
mean
the
officers
and
mr.
justice
holmes
back
in
1920
without
even
mentioning
the
word
standing,
said
that
these
books
and
records
could
not
be
used.
and
in
discussing
the
fifth
amendment
which
was
raised
at
that
time,
he
stated
that
the
court
--
let's
see
--
the
court
in
silverthorne
rejected
this
contention
on
page
22
of
my
brief
stating
that
the
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
are
to
be
protected
even
though
the
same
rights
and
the
same
result
might
have
been
achieved
in
a
lawful
way.
i
think
what
the
court
was
saying
is
that
you
preceded
in
a
lawful
way
and
therefore
you
cannot
derive
the
reason
--
benefits
of
this
unlawful
search
and
seizure
and
that
basically
is
the
holding
of
silverthorne.
while
it
gave
corporations
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment,
it
also
said
that
this
evidence
could
not
be
used
against
the
officers
of
the
corporation.
this
decision
was
filed
up
by
the
second
circuit
in
the
case
of
the
in
re
dooley
which
i
say
in
page
23
of
my
brief.
in
in
re
dooley
which
is
really
the
first
case
that
considered
the
question
of
standing
of
officers,
affirmed
silverthorne
in
its
interpretation
on
the
particular
facts
and
implied
it.
and
they
said
that
the
illegal
search
and
seizure
of
corporate
books
and
records
of
a
corporation
could
not
be
used
against
the
officers
of
the
same
corporation.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
well,
the
point
is
though
your
honor,
in
substance,
there
was
an
unlawful
search
really
and
the
courts
said
that
the
essence
of
the
provision
for
getting
the
acquisition
of
evidence
in
a
certain
way
is
that
not
merely
evidence
so
acquired
shall
be
not
used
before
the
court
but
that
it
shall
not
be
used
at
all.
and
in
substance,
this
is
what
the
court
was
saying,
no
matter
how
it
arose,
the
point
was
that
there
was
an
illegal
search
and
while
it
was
in
response
to
subpoena,
the
court
said
that
you
can't
use
this
evidence
and
therefore
we're
not
going
to
hold
a
party
in
contempt.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
that's
right
your
honor.
in
this
particular
case,
i
say
that
really
there
is
no
remedy
for
the
officer
of
the
union
because
when
the
books
and
records
were
seized,
the
authorities
have
got
to
use
of
the
books
and
records.
there
is
no
way
that
they
could
object
through
the
union
at
the
time
because
the
books
and
records
have
been
seized.
assuming
that
the
--
assuming
whether
or
not
the
union
had
or
the
officers
have
or
they
do
not
have
a
fifth
amendment
right,
they
have
--
the
officer
has
a
fourth
amendment
right
to
be
protected
that
in
this
particular
case,
he
was
the
victim
if
the
court
is
going
to
still
ascribe
to
the
jones
ruling
and
that
as
a
result
--
whether
we're
talking
about
the
jones
case,
whether
we're
talking
about
the
silverthorne
case,
beyond
the
premises
test
of
jones,
the
victimization
test
of
jones,
the
respondent
is
entitled
to
suppression
of
these
books
and
records.
the
illegality
is
admitted
and
the
only
question
is
standing
and
i
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
james
l.
lekin
and
i
am
assigned
counsel
for
the
respondent
(inaudible)
for
the
district
court
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
yes,
your
honor.
your
honor,
the
illegality
of
the
search
is
not
in
question.
the
respondent
takes
three
avenues
of
approach.
number
one,
jones
versus
united
states
gives
respondent
standing.
number
two,
silverthorne
lumber
company
versus
the
united
states
also
gives
standing.
and
then
number
three
and
i
think
this
is
important,
i
think
that
the
whole
concept
of
standing
perhaps
should
be
reexamined
by
the
court.
i
do
not
intend
at
this
time
to
do
so
unless
the
court
wants
to.
but
i
suggest
it
for
this
reason,
that
in
the
case
of
simmons
versus
the
united
states,
which
was
just
handed
down
approximately
one
month
ago
in
footnote
12,
involving
the
question
of
hearing
evidence
and
allowing
evidence
on
standing
to
go
into
trial.
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
that
the
question
of
standing
perhaps
was
examinable
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
linkletter
versus
walker
was
predicated
upon
deterrence.
approximately
10
days
ago
and
after
i
had
submitted
my
brief
to
this
court
that
i
saw
this
case,
but
i
refer
the
court
to
footnote
25
of
my
brief
which
says,
“in
which
i
argued
before
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
on
a
response
to
a
direct
question
by
judge
kaufman
who
wrote
the
opinion,
that
counsel
for
the
respondent
suggest
that
because
the
fourth
amendment
is
based
on
deterrence
rather
than
self-incrimination,
a
complete
examination
of
the
"on
the
premises"
test
and
the
standing
question
is
an
order”.
this
is
also
predicated
upon
linkletter
versus
walker.
and
in
this
same
footnote,
i
cited
the
same
footnote
--
i
cited
the
same
law
review
article
that
mr.
justice
harlan
had
cited.
i
don't
know
how
far
the
court
wants
me
to
get
into
this
because
that
has
not
been
thoroughly
briefed,
but
i
think
it
has
absolute
merit.
and
i
say
this
for
this
reason,
that
i
have
been
with
this
case
for
approximately
two
years
and
i
have
nothing
--
i've
had
nothing
but
to
occupy
my
time
in
the
issue
standing
outside
of
the
private
practice
of
law.
and
that
it
seems
to
me,
there
is
great
grounds
to
employ
standing
anymore
if
we're
going
to
have
the
deterrence
rationale.
because
if
deterrence
is
the
jugular
vein
of
the
fourth
amendment.
then
a
--
if
a
no
legal
search
and
seizure
occurs,
then
why
is
it
necessary
to
require
someone
who
have
a
possessory
interest
or
proprietary
interest
in
the
thing
seized
or
the
premises
searched.
and
i
will
end
it
at
that
and
if
the
court
wishes
to
pursue
it,
i
will
respond.
as
it
is
now,
respondent
comes
before
this
court
and
seeks
the
suppression
of
an
outright
illegal
search
and
seizure
of
union
books
and
records.
this
search
and
seizure
was
conducted
without
any
authority
and
the
respondent
in
answering
the
request
in
the
question
of
mr.
justice
brennan
does
not
rely
on
the
fifth
amendment.
i
don't
see
how
we
can
rely
on
the
fifth
amendment
because
i
think
white,
united
states
versus
white
and
wilson
preclude
our
reliance
on
the
fifth
amendment.
and
i
think
an
answer
to
your
question
your
honor,
at
footnote
9,
i
think
the
court
is
saying
perhaps
(inaudible).
mr.
james
l.
lekin
yes,
in
judge
kaufman's
opinion.
and
this
bothered
the
court
very
much
by
the
way
and
it
bothered
me
as
well,
that
if
you
have
for
instance,
a
situation
where
you
have
no
fifth
amendment
right,
what
happens
in
relationship
to
the
fourth
amendment?
and
of
course,
at
the
time
that
this
was
argued
and
at
the
present
time
right
now,
i
think
it
presents
to
some
extent
a
question
that
must
be
answered,
i
think
the
answer
is
obvious
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
no.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
your
honor,
i
think
it
has
nothing
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
alright,
to
answer
your
question,
i
think
that
the
fifth
amendment
--
white
and
wilson
have
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
fourth
amendment
in
this
particular
instance
and
i
have
explained
this
on
page
18
of
my
brief
as
well
as
i
can.
the
reason
i
don't
think
it
hasn't
anything
to
do
with
it
is
because
the
purposes
of
the
amendments
are
different.
the
fourth
is
aimed
at
preventing
a
legal
searches
and
seizures.
the
fifth
is
obviously
aimed
at
preventing
self-incrimination
which
goes
back
to
the
(inaudible)
proceedings
and
i
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
specifically,
in
the
terms
of
police
or
federal
authorities
going
into
whatever
it
might
be
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
that's
right.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
that's
right.
and
i
think
to
answer
your
question
to
pursue
it
even
further,
that's
why
--
in
this
instance,
if
the
court
is
going
to
determine
standing
for
--
prevails,
if
it's
going
to
require
standing,
i
think
the
court
really
has
to
take
a
look
at
what
standing
means
and
what
the
whole
rationale
of
personal
major
means.
what
does
the
victimization
test
of
jones
require
and
what
does
directed
at
it
--
require.
because
it's
beyond
me,
how
you
can
have
an
illegal
search
and
seizure
or
have
a
search
and
seizure
that
is
questioned.
and
say,
in
linkletter
and
infer
it
back
in
the
mapp
and
go
beyond
that
with
the
idea
of
preventing
authorities
from
going
into
homes
or
businesses
or
whatever
it
might
be
and
saying,
"we
don't
want
the
police
to
doing
this
and
we're
going
to
remove
every
incentive
there
is
because
we're
not
going
to
allow
the
evidences
if
they
violate
this".
and
then
at
the
same
time,
require,
for
instance
someone
to
come
in
and
say
that
they
have
to
have
a
proprietary
interest
or
they
have
to
be
on
the
premises.
for
instance,
when
we're
talking
about
jones
which
was
decided
in
1960
in
the
famous
quote
of,
“anyone
legitimately
on
that
premises
may
attack
a
search
and
seizure”.
right
there,
i
think
it
breaks
down
to
some
extent
because
you
can
have
somebody
that's
off
the
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
i
certainly
would
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
i'm
not
asking
you
to
go
that
far
your
honor.
i
--
and
i'm
not
asking
you
to
go
that
far
at
all.
and
i
will
be
satisfied
and
i
think
that
this
court
under
the
authority
of
jones
versus
united
states
hasn't
--
has
more
than
enough
because
the
respondent
meets
both
the
test.
i
think
he
was
clearly
the
victim,
and
second
of
all,
he
was
on
the
premises
when
the
search
and
seizure
occurred
and
he
objected
to
the
search
and
seizure.
and
so
i
don't
ask
that
this
court
completely
rule
out
standing,
if
they
don't
want
to.but
i
simply
say
that
there
is
merit
in
the
argument.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
well,
i
say
that
it's
no
good
in
the
light
of
united
states
versus
white,
it
looks
like
in
wilson,
because
there
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
because
--
i'm
not
agreeing
with
this
now.
but
i'm
simply
saying
that
the
authority
is
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
in
--
my
position
in
--
is
inconsistent
--
no,
i
don't.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
well,
because
i
assume
that
based
upon
these
two
cases,
that
he
has
no
fifth
amendment
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
well,
that's
a
good
question
your
honor,
because
the
case
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
the
case
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
oh,
i
don't
think
--
no,
no.
i
don't
think
it
does.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
well,
because
i
think
wilson
and
white
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
what
reason
is
there?
mr.
james
l.
lekin
well,
because
they're
saying
that
he's
required
because
--
the
--
as
an
officer,
if
hides
behind
the
façade
of
a
corporation
or
a
union
and
is
required
to
keep
books
and
records
that
the
fifth
amendment
is
a
personal
right
and
therefore
he
is
not
allowed
to
keep
it.
and
it
goes
back
to
the
rationale
of
the
fifth
amendment
being
a
personal
right.
and
i
take
it
that
the
state
has
tried
to
incorporate
this
same
argument
by
saying
the
fourth
amendment
is
personal.
my
point
is
that
the
two
amendments
are
recognizing
boyd
versus
the
united
states
in
recognizing
what
was
considered
to
be
an
interplay
at
the
time
that
the
case
was
decided.
and
going
back
to
entick
versus
carrington
and
all
subsequent
cases
after
boyd,
recognizing
that
the
interplay
existed,
are
they
dependent
upon
each
other?
and
i
don't
think
they
are
dependent
on
each
other.
i
think
boyd
or
mapp
points
it
out,
i
think
schmerber
makes
that
very
obviously,
schmerber
versus
california.
and
therefore,
at
the
time
your
honor,
because
it's
my
opinion
that
he
doesn't
have
a
fifth
amendment
right,
he
does
have
the
fourth
amendment
right
because
we're
talking
about
an
illegal
search
and
seizure.
we're
not
talking
about
the
serving
of
the
subpoena
and
the
refusal
to
do
it.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
that's
right.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
well,
the
--
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals,
what
--
i
think
we
have
to
go
back
to
jones,
what
does
jones
say?
jones
was
of
course
predicated
upon
a
possessorary
crime
of
narcotics.
and
the
courts
said,
twofold,
that
where
there
is
possession
in
the
charges
basic
in
that,
you
need
not
--
you're
not
required
to
assert
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
sense
of
standing.
it
also
assess
even
were
that
--
even
whether
or
not
this,
a
prosecution,
predicated
upon
possession
and
that
goes
on
and
says,
“anyone
legitimately
on
the
premises,
may
assert
the
fourth
amendment”.
and
i
think
it
was
on
this
case
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
jones.
now,
jones
at
the
very
inception
of
the
case,
says,
“that
in
order
--
that
a
person
must
be
a
victim.
that
is
the
person
must
be
against
whom
the
search
is
directed
--“
mr.
james
l.
lekin
i
don't
think
--
--
there's
no
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
--
question
about
it.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
well,
of
course
the
question
of
personal
privacy
becomes
the
ultimate
result
but
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
i
think
so
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
saying
that
deforte
is
a
respondent
--
was
the
victim
of
a
search
and
seizure.
in
other
words,
when
the
state
of
new
york
went
in
and
seized
these
books
and
records,
there
were
many
factors
that
indicated
that
he
--
and
not
just
the
union,
was
the
victim.
those
factors
were
this.
number
one,
monitors
had
been
placed
on
the
telephone.
number
two,
there
were
wiretaps.
number
three,
by
extinguishing
the
respondent
as
well
as
the
other
two
union
officers,
the
union
really
ceases
to
exist
because
you
incarcerate
these
people
if
you
can
convict
them
and
the
only
way
that
you
start
up
the
illegal
activities
again
is
to
either
do
one
or
two
things.
you
bring
in
new
officers,
or
you
get
the
same
officers
to
comeback
and
start
at
the
same
operation
again.
and
i
think
in
this
light,
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
"directed
at"
test.
in
other
words,
as
i
read
justice
frankfurter
in
his
decision
in
jones,
he
says
that
he
must
be
the
victim.
that
is
against
whom
the
search
and
seizure
is
directed
in
order
to
qualify
as
a
person
aggrieved.
and
as
in
--
and
is
--
in
this
sense
and
in
this
context
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
applied
jones
to
meet
this
requirement.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
an
unincorporated
association.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
that's
right.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
no,
there
isn't.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
alright.
do
you
mean
as
far
--
well,
are
you
talking
about
protecting
the
unincorporated
association
or
its
officers
or
both?
mr.
james
l.
lekin
i
think
that
obviously
it
does.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
yes
they
do.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
i
would
say
so
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
silverthorne
lumber
company
decided
in
1920
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
--
protects
corporations,
why
wouldn't
it
protect
the
union.
there's
no
reason
in
the
world
that
it
wouldn't
protect
a
union.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
if
i
understand
your
question,
for
instance
if
he
were
just
a
janitor
of
the
union
or
if
he
were
an
employee.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
deforte,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
if
i
were
arguing
for
that
position,
you
would
have
to
extend
jones
quite
a
length.
you
would
have
to
--
i
think
examine
whether
or
not
you're
going
to
have
the
standing
requirement.
i
think
what
you're
asking
is
can
really
anybody
raise
the
fourth
amendment
if
number
one,
you're
not
the
victim
and
possibly,
number
two,
they're
not
in
the
premises.
and
in
that
example,
i
would
think
that
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
yes,
but
the
problem
with
that
is
your
honor,
that
--
i
think
what
you're
asking
is
this.
in
order
to
qualify
as
person
agreed
by
an
unlawful
search
and
seizure,
one
must
have
been
the
victim
of
a
search
and
seizure.
one
against
whom
the
search
was
directed
as
distinguished
from
one
who
claims
prejudice.
now
i
suppose
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
well,
i'm
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
i'm
afraid
that
that's
what
jones
says
and
i
interpret
that
to
mean
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
yes,
i
realize
that.
but
of
course
rule
41
incorporated
many
aspects
of
what
they
thought
they
were
conforming
the
constitutional
standards.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
extortion,
and
a
number
of
other
things,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
you
mean
at
the
union
office?
mr.
james
l.
lekin
yes.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
no,
of
course
i
would
be
--
i'd
have
to
argue
much
strong
because
number
one,
he
wouldn't
be
on
the
premises.
and
number
two,
i
would
have
to
meet
justice
fortas'
question
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
a
victim
instead
of
whether
it
was
prejudice?
mr.
james
l.
lekin
that's
right,
it
is
your
honor
and
that's
why
i
suggested
at
the
very
inception
of
this
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
yes,
i
did.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
we
didn't
discuss
it
very
much
your
honor
because
at
that
point,
i
was
trying
to
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
your
honor,
i'm
here
to
of
course
affirm
the
decision
--
mr.
james
l.
lekin
that's
right.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
and
i'm
here
for
the
court
to
examine
or
ask
the
court
to
examine
the
decision
obviously.
but
judge
kaufman
of
course
accepted
my
argument
at
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
filed
a
very
detailed
brief
of
45
pages
that
really
went
into
this
quite
thoroughly
as
to
with
jones,
because
jones
at
that
time,
in
silverthorne
were
like
two
main
attacks.
i
thought
jones
apply
because
i
thought
obviously
that
deforte
was
the
victim.
i
thought
he
was
the
person
against
whom
the
search
was
directed,
and
secondly,
he
clearly
met
the
“on
the
premises”
test
which
has
been
cited
and
cited
again
by
this
court
as
being
a
relaxation
of
the
standing
requirement
and
it
was
on
those
two
premises
that
--
of
course
the
court
made
their
determination.
now,
in
their
brief
--
in
the
written
opinion,
the
court
did
not
deal
with
my
silverthorne
argument
because
of
course
they
didn't
have
to.
they
did
--
they
reached
it
via
jones
and
they
felt
that
it
was
unnecessary
and
they
were
correct
in
doing
so.
but
i'm
urging
this
court
to
affirm
on
three
grounds,
either
on
jones,
if
we're
going
to
keep
the
standing
requirement
which
i
assume
probably
will
be
kept.
secondly,
silverthorne
lumber
company
which
i've
laid
out
in
my
brief,
i
think
again
is
another
ground.but
third
of
all,
if
the
court
is
interested
and
i
don't
--
and
i
do
not
urge
the
court
to
do
this,
and
i
say
that
it
is
not
required
to,
but
if
the
court
is
interested
in
discussing
standing,
and
i
only
say
this
in
light
of
the
reference
that
mr.
justice
harlan
made
in
the
simmons
case,
because
in
that
footnote,
it
says
that
it
is
suggested
that
perhaps
we
should
do
--
we
should
reconsider
the
standing
requirement,
and
that's
why
i
began
my
argument
on
those
premises.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
no,
he
didn't
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
this
case
presents
grounds
to
examine
it
if
the
court
wants
to.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
silverthorne
lumber
company
was
decided
in
1920.
it's
a
very
short
opinion
written
by
justice
holmes.
and
in
silverthorne,
basically
what
happened
was
that
there
was
an
illegal
search
and
seizure
of
corporate
books
and
records.
the
books
and
records
were
copied
by
the
federal
government.
they
were
then
returned
to
the
company
in
its
officers.
thereafter
the
government,
through
a
subpoena
sought
to
obtain
the
originals
of
the
same
records
for
indictment
purposes
i
suppose.
they've
refused.
i
say
they,
i
mean
the
officers
and
mr.
justice
holmes
back
in
1920
without
even
mentioning
the
word
standing,
said
that
these
books
and
records
could
not
be
used.
and
in
discussing
the
fifth
amendment
which
was
raised
at
that
time,
he
stated
that
the
court
--
let's
see
--
the
court
in
silverthorne
rejected
this
contention
on
page
22
of
my
brief
stating
that
the
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
are
to
be
protected
even
though
the
same
rights
and
the
same
result
might
have
been
achieved
in
a
lawful
way.
i
think
what
the
court
was
saying
is
that
you
preceded
in
a
lawful
way
and
therefore
you
cannot
derive
the
reason
--
benefits
of
this
unlawful
search
and
seizure
and
that
basically
is
the
holding
of
silverthorne.
while
it
gave
corporations
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment,
it
also
said
that
this
evidence
could
not
be
used
against
the
officers
of
the
corporation.
this
decision
was
filed
up
by
the
second
circuit
in
the
case
of
the
in
re
dooley
which
i
say
in
page
23
of
my
brief.
in
in
re
dooley
which
is
really
the
first
case
that
considered
the
question
of
standing
of
officers,
affirmed
silverthorne
in
its
interpretation
on
the
particular
facts
and
implied
it.
and
they
said
that
the
illegal
search
and
seizure
of
corporate
books
and
records
of
a
corporation
could
not
be
used
against
the
officers
of
the
same
corporation.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
well,
the
point
is
though
your
honor,
in
substance,
there
was
an
unlawful
search
really
and
the
courts
said
that
the
essence
of
the
provision
for
getting
the
acquisition
of
evidence
in
a
certain
way
is
that
not
merely
evidence
so
acquired
shall
be
not
used
before
the
court
but
that
it
shall
not
be
used
at
all.
and
in
substance,
this
is
what
the
court
was
saying,
no
matter
how
it
arose,
the
point
was
that
there
was
an
illegal
search
and
while
it
was
in
response
to
subpoena,
the
court
said
that
you
can't
use
this
evidence
and
therefore
we're
not
going
to
hold
a
party
in
contempt.
mr.
james
l.
lekin
that's
right
your
honor.
in
this
particular
case,
i
say
that
really
there
is
no
remedy
for
the
officer
of
the
union
because
when
the
books
and
records
were
seized,
the
authorities
have
got
to
use
of
the
books
and
records.
there
is
no
way
that
they
could
object
through
the
union
at
the
time
because
the
books
and
records
have
been
seized.
assuming
that
the
--
assuming
whether
or
not
the
union
had
or
the
officers
have
or
they
do
not
have
a
fifth
amendment
right,
they
have
--
the
officer
has
a
fourth
amendment
right
to
be
protected
that
in
this
particular
case,
he
was
the
victim
if
the
court
is
going
to
still
ascribe
to
the
jones
ruling
and
that
as
a
result
--
whether
we're
talking
about
the
jones
case,
whether
we're
talking
about
the
silverthorne
case,
beyond
the
premises
test
of
jones,
the
victimization
test
of
jones,
the
respondent
is
entitled
to
suppression
of
these
books
and
records.
the
illegality
is
admitted
and
the
only
question
is
standing
and
i
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals.
thank
you
your
honor.
