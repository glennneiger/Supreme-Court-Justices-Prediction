justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
would
be
the
same
issue
if
he
had
refused
to
turnover
the
books
and
records
pursuant
to
subpoena
and
then
the
decisions
had
gotten
to
the
court
for
an
order
and
he
had
said,
"this
violates
my
own
rights".
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right,
absolutely.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
second
circuit
is
right,
the
union
official
that
charged
the
books
like
this
respondent,
the
union
official
does
not
need
to
turn
them
over
under
this
--
in
response
to
the
subpoena.
he
can
assert
his
fifth
amendment
rights
which
the
second
circuit
i
take
it
would
grant
him.and
if
that
the
state
goes
to
court
for
an
order
to
turn
them
over,
he
should
be
able
to
rely
on
his
fifth
amendment
rights
--
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
second
circuit
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
because
there
is
no
way
of
a
having
legal
seizure
under
this
opinion,
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it
extends
the
--
it
just
said,
the
gentleman
has
the
right
to
assert
his
rights
under
these
consequences,
we
--
under
these
circumstances,
why
wouldn't
his
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
fourth
amendment
rights
apply?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
requires
that
recognition
of
the
privilege
supplement.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
say
that
the
subpoena
was
served
on
this
gentleman,
he
was
in
charge
of
the
office
and
papers,
and
he
refused
to
turn
them
over
and
they
went
to
court
for
a
turnover
order,
or
he
persisted
in
it
and
they
got
--
and
they
cited
him
for
contempt.
and
his
basis
for
refusing
to
turnover
the
papers
was
the
fifth
amendment.
you
would
say
that
that
objection
is
no
good,
i
gather,
and
that
he
would
--
he
should
have
turn
them
over?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
well,
i
know
you
don't
agree
but
do
you
think
that
there's
something
inconsistent
between
your
position
and
white
and
wilson?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
tell
me
how
--
why
he
would
have
to
turn
the
papers
over
his
assertion
of
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
i
know
but
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
you
must
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
because
of
the
same
reasoning,
the
same
reason
may
very
well
destroy
the
fourth
amendment
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
reason
is
it
then,
that
he
doesn't
have
a
fifth
amendment
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
they
said
but
what
reason
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
mean
what
reason
did
the
courts
give
for
saying
that
the
--
he
doesn't
have
the
fifth
amendment
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
is
similar
to
the
back
--
just
like
in
the
case
of
the
corporation
might
have
--
not
have
a
fifth
amendment
but
would
have
a
fourth
amendment
right?
justice
byron
r.
white

that's
what's
said
about
rule
41,
not
about
the
