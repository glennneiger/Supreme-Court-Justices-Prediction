this

was
there
some
reason

to
this

what
i'm
really
asking
--
justice

white
why
then?
why
wouldn't
the
court

then
considered
dismissing
the
case
or
to

justice

white
that's
right.
justice
byron

white
well,
dutcher
(voice

--
justice
byron

who
were
the

who
were

white
--
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron

white
alright.
justice
byron

white
and
those
are
all

justice
byron

white
and
who
is
the
defendant?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
they
were
to
make
dutcher
an
involuntary
plaintiff?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
dutcher
had
been
an
involuntary
plaintiff
or
just
a
plaintiff?
justice
byron

white
even
after
he
was
a
--
even
after
an
out
of
state
administrator
takes
on
him?
justice

white
well,
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
time
the
court
of

got
the
case
then
there
could've
been
complete
diversity
between
plaintiffs
and
defendants
if
dutcher
were
a
plaintiff?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
certainly
--
and
certainly,
he
had
a
plaintiff's
interest
in
this
case.
i
mean,
he
belong
as
much
on
one
side
as
another?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
maybe
but
rather
than
dismiss
action
when
you've
got
an
indispensable
party,
why
wouldn't
the
court
just
order
him
to
join?
justice
byron
r.
white
weather
the
rule
19
(a)
says,
if
he
has
not
been

joined
the
court
shall
order
that
he
be
made

justice
byron

oh,
i
know,
but
i
was
wondering
why
the
court
of

didn't
do
it?
justice

white
what
theory?
that
doesn't
change
a
theory.
justice

white
oh,
i
agree
with
you.
justice
byron

white
i
agree
with
you.
justice

white
oh,
it's
already
been

anyway?
justice

white
it's
already
been
tried
out
at
another
case
in

with
dutcher
as
a
witness.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
doesn't
the
rule
order
the
court
to
do
that?
justice
byron

white
is
lumbermens'
principal

in
pennsylvania?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
lumbermens
citizenship
with
the
purposes
of
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
only
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
if
it
were?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
what's
the
impact
on
dutcher?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
spell
that
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
was
--
what
do
you
mean
prevail?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
there
was
coverage
or
that
there
wasn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
your
client's
problem,
not
dutcher's.
all
that
mean
is
that
--
all
that
mean
is
that
the
insurance
company
pays
out
money
under
this
federal
judgment
that
he
will
have
an
issue
here
where
coverage
was
found.
and
then
if
dutcher
would
do
--
isn't
in
this
case,
prevails
against
the
insurance
company
in
another
suit,
it
may
be
the
insurance
company
has
--
will
pay
double
payments
but
that's
not
--
that
should
--
that
isn't
dutcher's
problem.
that's
yours.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we're
talking
about
whether
dutcher
is
an
indispensable
party.
we're
not
talking
about
the
insurance
company.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
somebody
who
know
the
indispensable
party?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
even
get
to
analyzing
the
factors
under
rule
19,
did
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
happened,
the
judgment
stand?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
way,
could
you
tell
me,
is
there
any
--
has
there
been
any
suggestion
in
this
litigation
by
anybody
that
dutcher
is
bound
by
this
suit
in
a
sense
that
he
and
the
insurance
company's
interest
are
the
same
or
that
they
are
in
brevity
and
therefore
res
judicata
would
apply
to
dutcher
if
we
try
to
litigate
this
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
you're
really
arguing
that
he
is
an
indispensable
party
in
this
suit,
mostly
because
the
insurance
company
might
pay,
say,
double
liability
and
dutcher
prevails
against
--
to
these
other
actions.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i'm
sorry.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
i
ask
you
this,
who
calls
dutcher
as
the
witness
in
this
other's
lawsuit
where
he
did
testify
and
it
was
found
--
the
jury
found
coverage,
is
that
in
the
federal
court
or
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
a
companion
suit
in
the
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
and
he
did
litigate?
he
did
testify?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
the
insurance
company
called
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
carrier
lost
that
lawsuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
there
a
provision
in
rule
19
for
making
somebody
into
involuntary
plaintiffs
in
a
proper
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
that
dutcher's
interest
really
--
he
could
be
on
either
side
of
this
case,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me
how
he
could
be
a
plaintiff,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
wouldn't
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
even
if
it
--
even
if
there's
no
indispensable
party
here
under
19,
and
you
suggest
we
apply
19,
even
if
this
party,
if
dutcher
is
indispensable,
you'd
say
that
incorporates
19
(a)
don't
you
in
terms
of
what
would
might
be
called
necessary
party
rather
than
an
indispensable
party
that
it
is

and
if
it's

join
him,
he
ought
to
be
joined.

would
you
make

you
did

you
