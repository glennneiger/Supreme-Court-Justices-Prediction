mr.
avram
g.
adler
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
chief
justice
and
justices
of
the
supreme
court,
this
is
a
case
involving
two
very
important
issues.
first,
the
scope
and
orbit
of
the
declara
--
the
federal
declaratory
judgment
action
and
two,
the
reach
and
scope
of
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
19
and
its
subsequent
clarification
in
the
new
rule
of
19
as
it
went
into
effect
on
july
1st,
1966.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
not
in
dispute
and
are
fairly
simple.
an
automobile
driven
by
an
individual
by
the
name
of
cionci
traveling
at
high
speed
across
the
median
strip
and
struck
a
vehicle
operated
by
thomas
smith.
the
cionci
vehicle
had
as
passengers
the
lynch
and
john
l.
harris.
cionci,
smith
and
lynch
were
all
killed.
cionci
was
without
any
assets.
cionci
and
lynch
had
borrowed
the
car
from
one
dutcher,
who
was
the
name
assured
of
an
insurance
policy
issued
by
lumbermens
mutual
casualty
company,
who
i
shall
call
lumbermens
here
after.
the
primary
issues
as
to
whether
coverage
was
to
be
accorded
cionci
was
one
whether
--
there
was
no
question
that
consent
had
been
given.
the
only
question
was
whether
the
geographical
orbit
of
the
consent
has
been
exceeded.
in
as
much
as
--
there
was
some
question
originally
as
to
whether
cionci
was
the
driver,
this
is
now
but
admitted
and
is
resolved.
the
declaratory
judgment
action
was
originally
brought
on
the
two
bases
as
to
determine
that
cionci
was
the
driver
and
to
determine
the
coverage
of
the
insurance
policy.
a
suit
was
brought
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
--
for
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
by
the
provident
tradesmen
and
trust
company
as
administrators
of
the
estate
of
lynch
against
the
estate
of
cionci.
lumbermens
did
not
defend
that
equal
judgment
was
entered,
the
issue
was
subsequently
settled,
and
the
settlement
was
approved
at
which
point
lumbermens
did
enter
into
the
hearing
and
the
judgment
now
exist
for
$50,000
for
the
estate
of
lynch
against
the
estate
of
cionci.
in
addition,
actions
were
brought
in
delaware
county
which
is
a
county
contiguous
to
philadelphia
by
the
estate
of
smith
and
john
l.
harris
who
was
not
killed.
those
actions
have
never
gotten
beyond
the
pleading
stage
even
though
in
those
actions
dutcher
is
represented
by
counsel
furnished
to
him
by
the
insurer,
lumbermens.
the
--
a
declaratory
judgment
action
was
then
brought
by
provident
tradesmen
bank
and
trust
company
to
determine
whether
or
not
cionci
was
insured
under
the
permissive
use
clause
of
the
insurance
policy.
this
was
important
because
without
the
coverage
actions
against
cionci
would
be
a
mere
academic
exercise
and
just
would
be
no
funds,
cionci
is
dead
and
there
were
no
assets.
lumbermens
then
moved
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
join
an
indispensable
party
naming
john
l.
harris
and
the
estate
of
thomas
w.
smith
as
such.
the
actions
were
then
amended
to
bring
them
in
and
the
action
went
--
then
went
forward.
at
no
point
thereafter
was
any
motions
made
or
the
issue
raised
as
to
dutcher
being
an
indispensable
party
until
the
court
of
appeals
raised
it
sua
sponte
at
the
argument
after
the
case
had
gone
to
verdict
and
during
argument
on
other
issues.
at
the
trial,
the
question
of
the
interest
of
dutcher
came
up
under
the
pennsylvanian
so-called
dead
man's
rule
which
has
--
justice
goodrich
reviews
in
detail
in
wright
versus
wilson
is
a
holdover
from
the
old
vouch
--
the
old
concept
that
a
man
who
had
some
interest
or
no
matter
how
remote
or
contingent
was
being
nabbed
to
be
able
to
tell
the
truth
in
a
cause
of
action.
we
still
preserve
the
pennsylvania
dead
man's
rule
and
during
the
brief
--
the
colloquies
preceding
their
trial.
it
was
contended
by
counsel
for
the
estate
of
lynch
that
dutcher
had
such
an
interest
as
would
make
him
incompetent
under
the
pennsylvania
dead
man's
rule
and
it
was
contended
by
lumbermen
that
he
did
not
had
such
an
interest.
the
lower
court
ruled
that
dutcher
was
incompetent.
i
should
explain
in
this
case,
at
this
prosecuted
case
despite
the
fact
that
there
had
been
an
attempts
made
at
pretrial
procedure
to
determine
the
amount
of
insurance.
this
was
resisted
by
lumbermens
and
we
had
to
deal
with
philosophical
concepts
rather
than
the
actual
amount
so
that
we
--
that's
why
the
court's
make
allusions
to
finite
limits.
it
was
contended
that
the
interest
of
dutcher
was
such
as
to
render
him
incompetent
under
the
dead
man's
rule
because
they're
being
finite
limits.
dutcher
being
a
party
defendant
to
the
actions
in
the
delaware
county
that
this
would
influence
his
decision
such
as
to
make
him
incompetent
under
the
pennsylvania
dead
man's
rule.
and
of
course
it
was
contended
by
lumbermens
to
the
contrary.
the
action
with
--
dutcher
did
testify
at
the
trial
because
as
to
harris
he
was
not
incompetent.
the
jury
rendered
a
verdict
in
that
cionci
was
operating
the
automobile
within
the
geographical
scope
of
permission.
it
found
dutcher's
testimony
not
credible
as
to
the
court
in
the
--
in
ruling
on
the
post
trial
motions.
there
was
a
directed
verdict
for
the
estate
of
lynch
and
the
estate
of
smith
in
as
much
as
the
pennsylvania
rule,
there
is
a
presumption
that
the
driver
of
the
vehicle,
the
driving
with
this
permission
of
the
owner
and
there
was
no
testimony
for
the
contrary
as
to
those
estates.
when
the
case
came
on
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
issue
of
indispensable
party
having
been
raised
sua
sponte
the
court
then
did
not
rule
for
some
18
months
and
then
had
reargued
and
subsequently
rendered
the
decisions
which
had
brought
us
into
the
court
today.
the
majority
opinion
if
i
may
characterize
it,
have
it
so
briefly
is
that
the
dutcher
is
an
indispensable
party
in
as
much
as
his
interest
will
be
effected
in
as
much
as
he
is
a
defendant
in
the
delaware
county
cases.
mr.
avram
g.
adler
and
they
stopped
right
there.
they
did
not
make
any
further
inquiry.
they
didn't
follow
the
purport
of
the
new
trends
as
to
rule
19.
i
won't
propose
in
this
short
time
to
trace
the
history
of
the
indispensable
party
concept.
this
was
done
brilliantly
by
professor
reid
and
professor
(inaudible),
it
was
originally
a
doctrine
born
in
equity
in
which
equity
would
withhold
its
grace
from
--
unless
all
the
parties
were
before
it
unless
it
could
do
substantial
or
total
justice.
however,
this
concept
when
he
transmigrated
into
the
legal
side
of
the
court
then
became
a
tool
of
legal
oppression
rather
than
of
help.
and
as
a
result
of
the
article
of
greed
and
hazard,
a
tentative
rule
was
proposed
and
circulated
to
setup
various
criteria
if
the
court
should
consider
under
rule
19
before
a
case
was
dismissed
under
the
indispensable
party
concept.
a
research
instructor
at
harvard
by
the
name
of
fink
(ph)
then
wrote
a
contrary
article
saying
that
the
indispensable
party
concept
was
one
of
substantive
law
and
beyond
the
reach
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
these
articles
were
all
before
the
committee
which
tool
the
new
rule
19
and
in
an
unusually
lengthy
notes
and
comments
in
the
new
rule
19.
it
is
clear
that
they
rejected
the
concept,
i
think,
advance
the
arguments
of
greed
and
hazard
and
set
forth
minimum
criteria
which
should
have
been
followed
by
a
court
before
dismissing
under
the
indispensable
party
concept.
it
is
the
complaint
of
the
petitioner
here
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
majority
opinion
did
not
do
this.
and
if
i
may
just
examine
the
various
criteria
by
which
they
could
have
say
this
judgment
and
it
is
a
difficult
case.
it
was
a
case
that
previous
inquiries
have
been
done
and
the
issue
of
coverage
is
crucial.
the
new
rule
19
says
the
first
factor
is
what
does
judgment
bring
--
to
mean
to
the
absentee,
dutcher.
if
anything,
it
is
clearly
to
his
advantage
because
he
gets
a
second
--
if
we
accept
the
fact
that
he
has
an
interest.
he
gets
a
second
opportunity
in
as
much
as
he's
not
bound
by
the
judgment.
but
had
the
judgment
been
adverse
to
the
petitioner
then
we
would
have
been
bound.
dutcher
in
this
action
had
everything
to
gain
and
nothing
to
lose.
if
he
won,
these
foreclosed
the
petitioners.
if
he
lost,
he
still
had
a
second
opportunity
and
this
of
course
was
fully
cognizant
--
fully
aware
--
was
within
the
contemplation
of
the
respondent.
the
second
pragmatic
factor
and
the
rule
maker
--
the
committee
who
fashioned
the
rule
used
the
word
pragmatic
repeatedly
and
it
is
not
as
that
respondent
says
in
it's
a
brief,
a
conclusionary
fact.
it
is
a
seeking
fact,
it
is
an
initial
fact.
it
is
the
--
what
is
good
and
best
for
the
parties,
all
the
parties.
the
second
pragmatic
factor
is
highly
important.
the
interest
of
dutcher
was
highly
remote
and
contingent
and
therefore
the
court
could
have
and
should
have
shaped
the
relief.
they
could
have
very
easily
conditioned
the
judgment
by
merely
saying,
we
will
affirm
the
judgment.
we
will
not
find
dutcher
an
indispensable
party.
we
won't
even
consider
it
if
the
parties
here
agree
to
limit
their
claims
against
all
defendants,
dutcher
or
cionci
to
the
policy
limits
which
have
now
been
admitted
to
be
$100,000.
had
this
been
done
this
case
would've
stopped
right
there.
i
--
as
i
have
said
in
my
brief,
i
am
authorized
and
i
have
been
authorized
to
do
just
that
and
accept
such
a
conditional
one.
and
then
we
don't
have
--
i
have
to
consider
the
interest
of
dutcher
one
bit.
yet,
this
was
never
afforded
the
petitioners.
the
interest
of
dutcher
never
had
to
arise
to
the
dignity
of
an
indispensable
party
concept
had
the
court
merely
followed
the
second
pragmatic
factor
which
new
rule
19
sets
forth
as
minimum
criteria.
i'd
like
at
this
point
--
because
it's
mentioned
in
the
respondent's
brief,
to
explain
the
inconsistencies
if
such
there
be
and
i
hope
to
show
that
there
is
not
between
claiming
the
interest
of
dutcher
so
as
to
preclude
him
from
testifying
under
the
pennsylvania
dead
man's
rule
and
arguing
here
that
is
in
--
in
his
interest
is
remote
and
contingent.
under
pennsylvania
law,
remoteness
and
contingency
as
long
as
the
interest
is
pecuniary
and
adverse
does
not
preclude
him
from
being
found
incompetent
under
the
pennsylvania
dead
man's
rule.
the
best
case
to
cite
that
is
and
i've
chosen
an
extreme
case
is
alcorn
versus
cook
which
is
cited
in
the
brief,
where
the
husband
of
a
legatee
without
any
showing
that
she
might
not
be
able
--
that
there
might
not
be
sufficient
funds
was
precluded
from
testifying.
not
only
was
there
a
remoteness
and
contingency
as
to
whether
there
would
be
sufficient
funds
for
the
legatee.
but
there
was
remoteness
as
to
the
husband's
interest
because
he
would
have
to
survive
the
wife
in
order
to
have
his
interest
brought
into
play.
nevertheless
the
--
under
pennsylvania
law
the
husband
was
found
incompetent
to
testify
under
the
pennsylvania
dead
man's
rule.
now
that's
not
so,
where
you
have
the
indispensable
party
concept.
there
the
interest
must
be
direct
and
crucial.
and
we
submit
that
it's
not
in
this
case.
it
is
significant
that
this
--
as
i
point
out
in
my
brief
that
the
delaware
county
cases
have
never
gotten
out
of
the
pleading
stage
even
after
this
decision.
they
have
lain
dormant
there
for
some
eight
years
and
it
is
significant
that
counsel
for
dutcher
is
furnished
by
the
respondent
here
in
lumbermens
mutual
casualty
company.
they
have
done
nothing
to
resolve
dutcher's
interest.
in
their
brief,
they
say,
well,
the
estate
of
lynch
could
have
brought
these
actions
to
the
court.
this
is
not
so
as
far
as
this
petitioner
is
concerned.
the
personal
representative
of
the
estate
of
lynch
in
this
action
is
not
the
defendant
in
the
delaware
county
cases
as
i
have
pointed
out
in
my
brief.
the
plaintiffs
in
those
cases
had
their
own
personal
representative
for
the
estate
of
lynch
appointed
again
for
the
purposes
of
reaching
the
insurance
statute
and
no
action
was
brought
against
the
estate
of
lynch
as
such
by
its
actual
personal
representative
which
was
provident
tradesmen
bank
and
trust
company.
the
third
factor
which
was
advanced
by
the
advisory
committee
is
whether
an
adequate
judgment
can
be
rendered
in
the
absence
of
dutcher.
we
submit
that
it
can.
the
crucial
issue
was
resolved
which
is
the
permission
of
dutcher.
dutcher
testified
at
this
trial.
this
is
not
a
case
of
someone
who's
--
who
was
not
present.
he
came
into
court.
he
testified.
he
said,
i
didn't
give
them
the
necessary
permission,
the
jury
rejected
his
testimony.
the
fourth
factor
based
by
the
advisory
committee
looks
to
the
practical
effect
of
the
dismissal
and
there
i
asked
this
court
to
look
to
the
minority
opinion,
the
dissenting
opinion
in
this
case.
we
have
now
--
this
has
been
8
years
in
the
courts.
the
issue
has
been
resolved.
to
trudge
back
again
is
a
terrible
burden,
especially
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
a
judgment
can
be
rendered
which
makes
dutcher's
interest
absolutely
known
which
is
to
say,
we
will
uphold
the
judgment
if
the
plaintiffs
agree
to
confine
all
their
claims
against
both
dutcher
and
cionci
to
the
policy
rights.
dutcher
then
has
no
interest
at
all
and
has
no
cause
to
complain.
the
only
one
then
who
has
a
cause
to
complain
is
the
respondent
who
wants
a
second
chance
to
litigate
this
issue.
they've
had
their
day
in
court
and
they
want
to
litigate
it
again.
the
court
unfortunately
after
finding
dutcher
and
then
this
defensible
party
then
went
on
and
said
that
the
lower
court
abused
its
discretion
in
entertaining
the
declaratory
judgment
action.
it
made
one
very
crucial
error
in
this
determination.
it
assumed
that
the
actions
in
delaware
county
were
the
same
as
the
actions
in
the
federal
court
and
this
is
not
so.
the
actions
in
delaware
county,
no
state
court
actions
were
actions
by
the
estate
of
smith
and
living
plaintiff
harris
against
the
estate
of
cionci,
the
estate
of
lynch,
and
dutcher.
the
insurer,
respondent
is
not
a
party
to
the
action.
by
pennsylvania
law
the
question
of
insurance
can't
even
be
brought
up
in
those
actions.
there
would
be
no
inkling
to
the
trier
of
fact
in
those
actions
that
there
was
any
insurance
involved.
and
the
court
of
appeals
completely
overlooks
the
very
important
thing
that
this
declaratory
judgment
action
is
not
only
proper
but
we
believe
it
would
have
been
a
--
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
refuse
to
entertain
it
because
the
--
a
single
crucial
issue
is
here
being
determined
which
changes
an
academic
exercise
into
a
very
real
and
vital
thing.
and
i
might
also
point
out
that
this
declaratory
judgment
action
also
benefits
dutcher
because
as
were
shown
in
the
action
by
the
estate
of
lynch,
lumbermens
never
defended
that
action.
if
this
judgment
is
upheld
then
lumbermens
will
vigorously
defend
against
the
plaintiff's
actions
in
the
delaware
county
case
thus,
limiting
the
--
or
attempting
to
limit
the
exposure
of
cionci
and
to
preserve
what
is
left
for
dutcher.
i
might
point
out
that
the
case
against
dutcher
in
the
delaware
county
cases
based
upon
the
record
which
we
have
here
is
very
naked
and
very
remote.
dutcher
handed
the
keys
and
lent
the
car
to
cionci
and
lynch.
there's
no
other
connection
with
the
case.
he
wasn't
present
during
the
accident.
in
the
defendant's
brief,
they
has
say,
well,
maybe
the
brakes
were
bad
and
there
is
an
allegation
and
the
complaint
that
brakes
were
bad.
but
if
the
testimony
in
the
court
below,
nothing
was
ever
said
about
brakes,
i
don't
submit
however
that
that's
a
controlling
issue
in
the
light
of
the
arguments
i've
made
here
before.
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time?
mr.
avram
g.
adler
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps
i
spoke
too
quickly
in
my
first
opportunity
to
address
the
jury
and
i
did
not
give
the
antecedent
history
as
clearly
as
i
should
have
done.
counsel
representing
the
estate
of
lynch
brought
a
suit
against
the
estate
of
cionci
who
was
the
driver
and
it's
now
admitted
that
he
was
the
driver.
in
an
investigation
showed
that
cionci
had
no
assets
whatsoever.
these
were
all
very
serious
and
reasonable.
the
estate
of
lynch
then
brought
a
declaratory
judgment
action
against
lumbermens
to
determine
whether
there
would
be
coverage
for
cionci
so
that
this
suit
would
not
be
a
mere
academic
exercise.
the
lumbermens
then
motioned
to
bring
in
all
the
other
injured
parties,
dutcher
was
never
brought
in,
and
the
suit
went
forward
on
that
basis
and
a
jury
found
coverage
as
to
--
by
the
record
verdict
and
by
an
actual
verdict
on
the
evidence,
a
jury
found
coverage.
mr.
avram
g.
adler
lumebermens
mutual
insurance
company
to
bring
in
the
other
claimants,
at
no
time
even
at
the
pre-trial,
the
day
requested
dutcher
be
brought
in
as
an
indispensable
party.
there
is
no
question
that
dutcher
would
be
a
plaintiff
in
this
case.
they
answer
mr.
white
because
by
mr.
harvey's
own
admission,
there
is
a
per
--
there
is
a
potential
conflict
between
dutcher
and
the
insurance
company
so
that
he
would
be
a
possible
--
mr.
avram
g.
adler
that
could
have
been
done
had
the
issue
been
raised.
it
was
not
raised
--
mr.
avram
g.
adler
he
could
be
either
--
on
either
side
and
this
is
a
question
that
troubled
me
a
great
deal.
mr.
avram
g.
adler
well,
as
mr.
harvey
pointed
out,
he
says
that
if
dutcher
loses
in
the
delaware
country
actions,
he
would
then
have
a
suit
against
lumbermen
which
then
indicates
a
potential
conflict
between
lumbermens
and
dutcher
and
therefore
he
could
be
a
made
a
plaintiff.
and
therefore,
under
no
circumstances,
just
to
cover
the
approach
that
your
honor
made
yesterday.
at
best,
the
court
could
have
under
19
(a)
merely
sent
the
case
back
to
include
dutcher
as
an
involuntary
plaintiff.
the
majority
opinion
for
reasons
which
we
do
not
understand
seemed
intended
to
establish
a
substantive
complex
and
to
work
the
thrust
of
the
modern
approach
in
rule
19.
but
if
i
may
just
briefly
sketch
this
--
the
approaches
that
we
--
that
are
to
be
taken,
if
the
majority
opinion
approach
is
taken,
then
there
will
not
be
just
a
possible
conflict
as
mr.
harvey
points
out.
but
there
will
be
three
poss
--
or
four
possible
conflicts,
because
under
pennsylvania
rules,
each
of
these
cases
would
be
litigated
and
then
each
of
these
various
claimants
would
then
have
to
bring
a
separate
garnishment
action
and
you
could
get
three
separate
conflicting
approaches
as
to
the
coverage
question,
which
would
be
a
sheer
nightmare.
the
declaratory
judgment
action
in
this
case
was
the
most
economical
way
of
determining
the
issue.
now,
under
19
(a),
if
your
honors
were
to
send
it
back
under
19
(a)
to
make
ducther
an
involuntary
plaintiff,
then
being
the
law
of
the
case
that
the
pennsylvania
dead
man's
rule
applies.
and
by
sending
it
back
under
19
(a),
the
court
recognizes
the
interest
of
dutcher
and
it
has
been
argued
here
as
to
the
interest
of
dutcher
by
counsel
for
the
insurance
company,
then
it
means
the
various
estates
would
prevail
because
under
the
pennsylvania
presumption,
dutcher
could
not
testify
and
again
they
would
get
their
directive
verdict.
and
the
only
person
who
could
suffer
would
be
the
live
plaintiff
who
was
severely
injured
and
he
might
get
a
conflicting
result.
and
lumbermens
gets
an
opportunity
to
relitigate
that
issue
and
submit
that
again
toa
jury
which
i
humbly
submit
they
do
not
deserve.
they've
had
their
day
in
court.
under
no
circumstances
can
dutcher
suffer.
now,
it
has
been
argued
that
dutcher
may
be
found
a
defendant
in
the
delaware
county
cases
and
then
he
can
sue
the
insurance
company.
but
as
your
honors
pointed
out,
only
the
insurance
company
would
suffer
thereby.
but
even
under
those
circumstances,
under
the
opinion
suggested
--
under
the
order
suggested
by
judge
freedman
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
the
judgment
here
would
await
the
resolution
of
those
delaware
county
cases.
if
dutcher
is
found
not
guilty
in
this
action,
and
there's
a
good
chance
of
that
because
all
he
did
was
hand
the
keys
to
these
men
and
these
men
took
the
car
away
and
cionci
was
driving
at
90
miles
an
hour
and
crossed
the
median
strip,
the
likelihood
that
dutcher
would
be
found
guilty
as
a
defendant
is
highly
unlikely.
and
if
he
is
found
absolved
in
those
delaware
county
cases,
then
there
is
no
conflict
at
all.
and
lumbermens
pays
the
--
judgment
that
been
found
in
these
cases.
and
it
is
significant
as
i
pointed
out
yesterday
that
despite
the
fact
that
lumbermens
represents
dutcher
in
those
cases,
those
cases
have
stayed
on
the
books
for
eight
years
even
though
delaware
county
is
a
short
docket
county
and
they've
done
nothing
to
resolve
it.
but
taking
judge
freedman's
opinion
one
step
further,
we
as
the
counsel
for
the
claimants
and
the
counsel
for
all
claimants
are
in
this
court
today,
we
are
willing
to
accept
a
conditional
order
which
says
that
we
will
limit
our
claims
against
all
the
defendants
including
dutcher
to
the
$100,000
policy.
so
that
by
affirming
the
order
of
the
lower
court
and
making
it
conditional,
then
dutcher
has
no
danger
at
all
and
in
fact
he
hasn't
any,
and
lumbermens
has
no
danger
of
paying
out
more
than
their
contractual
limit.
and
this
can
be
done
under
19
(b),
the
whole
thrust,
and
that's
the
importance
of
this
case.
ninth
--
new
rule
19
set
up
various
means
by
which
this
whole
concept
of
indispensable
party
can
be
put
aside
for
pragmatic
considerations.
and
the
rule
makers
kept
using
that
word
pragmatic
consideration.
it
is
not
at
all
unknown
for
a
court
to
so
do,
to
put
a
condition
on
the
affirmance
of
an
order.
and
we
would
accept
such
a
condition.
and
under
that
posture,
and
we
set
this
in
our
brief,
lumbermens
has
not
met
that
challenge.
they
have
not
answered
this
premise
as
i
advanced
yesterday
and
as
i
advanced
now,
the
reason
for
that
is
that
lumbermens
wants
to
relitigate
this
thing.
they
want
a
second
day
in
court.
and
i
say
to
your
honors,
this
case
has
been
on
the
books
for
nine
years
and
it
was
no
fault
to
the
plaintiffs
that
it
was
on
the
books
for
nine
years.
the
court
of
appeals
sat
on
this
case
for
almost
two
years
for
reasons
which
we
do
not
understand
and
then
ordered
an
argument
in
bond.
this
case
was
ordered
on
the
trial
list
within
five
months
after
it
was
first
filed,
so
that
we
have
not
delayed,
but
it
has
been
in
courts
for
a
long
time.
this
court
has
within
its
power,
the
opportunity
to
terminate
this
litigation
by
making
such
a
conditional
order
and
all
counsel
have
authorized
me
to
say
that
they
would
accept
such
a
condition,
that
all
the
claims
of
all
the
plaintiffs
will
be
limited
to
the
insurance
coverage
of
a
$100,000.
the
issue
has
been
litigated
under
--
the
importance
of
this
case
is
that
the
rule
19
gives
the
opportunity
to
the
courts
to
use
these
pragmatic
considerations
to
be
practical
as
opposed
to
the
impractical.
and
this
is
the
first
important
case
under
rule
19,
and
this
case
could
be
a
guide
stone
to
the
lower
courts
in
getting
away
from
this
rigid
approach
to
the
indispensable
party
context.
mr.
avram
g.
adler
thank
you.
mr.
avram
g.
adler
that
--
mr.
avram
g.
adler
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
19
(a)
would
prevail.
however,
if
there
were
no
means
by
which
this
case
can
be
terminated
now,
if
we
go
back
under
19
(a),
there
is
a
chance
of
injustice
to
harris.
however
this
court
by
a
conditional
order,
and
19
(b)
does
give
that
opportunity,
could
say
we
affirm
this
judgment
under
conditions
that
the
plaintiffs
agree
or
signed
a
certificate
or
a
motion
that
they
will
limit
their
claims
to
all
the
defendants
$200,000
and
that
terminates
the
litigation
and
either
dutcher
nor
the
defendant
can
be
hurt
thereby.
they've
had
their
day
in
court.
mr.
avram
g.
adler
no
sir,
i
did
not
because
this
was
raised
sua
sponte
at
the
first
argument
and
at
the
second
argument
we
argue
that
the
question
that
the
dutcher
is
being
an
indispensable
party.
i
did
make
it
however
your
honors
in
my
brief
in
this
case,
perhaps
i
should
have
made
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
avram
g.
adler
i
represent
the
--
mr.
avram
g.
adler
i
represent
the
estate
of
lynch
and
counsel
--
mr.
avram
g.
adler
i
--
and
counsel
for
the
other
two
parties.
the
estate
of
smith
and
harris
is
in
court
and
is
present
and
he
joins
with
me
in
that
offer
to
the
court.
and
i
have
so
stated
it
in
my
brief.
mr.
avram
g.
adler
mr.
nelson
who
is
counsel
for
the
other
two
claimants
joined
with
me
in
that.
we
seek
to
terminate
this
litigation
and
we
submit
that
this
is
an
opportunity
under
the
practical
aspects
of
rule
19
to
solve
it.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
avram
g.
adler
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
chief
justice
and
justices
of
the
supreme
court,
this
is
a
case
involving
two
very
important
issues.
first,
the
scope
and
orbit
of
the
declara
--
the
federal
declaratory
judgment
action
and
two,
the
reach
and
scope
of
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
19
and
its
subsequent
clarification
in
the
new
rule
of
19
as
it
went
into
effect
on
july
1st,
1966.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
not
in
dispute
and
are
fairly
simple.
an
automobile
driven
by
an
individual
by
the
name
of
cionci
traveling
at
high
speed
across
the
median
strip
and
struck
a
vehicle
operated
by
thomas
smith.
the
cionci
vehicle
had
as
passengers
the
lynch
and
john
l.
harris.
cionci,
smith
and
lynch
were
all
killed.
cionci
was
without
any
assets.
cionci
and
lynch
had
borrowed
the
car
from
one
dutcher,
who
was
the
name
assured
of
an
insurance
policy
issued
by
lumbermens
mutual
casualty
company,
who
i
shall
call
lumbermens
here
after.
the
primary
issues
as
to
whether
coverage
was
to
be
accorded
cionci
was
one
whether
--
there
was
no
question
that
consent
had
been
given.
the
only
question
was
whether
the
geographical
orbit
of
the
consent
has
been
exceeded.
in
as
much
as
--
there
was
some
question
originally
as
to
whether
cionci
was
the
driver,
this
is
now
but
admitted
and
is
resolved.
the
declaratory
judgment
action
was
originally
brought
on
the
two
bases
as
to
determine
that
cionci
was
the
driver
and
to
determine
the
coverage
of
the
insurance
policy.
a
suit
was
brought
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
--
for
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
by
the
provident
tradesmen
and
trust
company
as
administrators
of
the
estate
of
lynch
against
the
estate
of
cionci.
lumbermens
did
not
defend
that
equal
judgment
was
entered,
the
issue
was
subsequently
settled,
and
the
settlement
was
approved
at
which
point
lumbermens
did
enter
into
the
hearing
and
the
judgment
now
exist
for
$50,000
for
the
estate
of
lynch
against
the
estate
of
cionci.
in
addition,
actions
were
brought
in
delaware
county
which
is
a
county
contiguous
to
philadelphia
by
the
estate
of
smith
and
john
l.
harris
who
was
not
killed.
those
actions
have
never
gotten
beyond
the
pleading
stage
even
though
in
those
actions
dutcher
is
represented
by
counsel
furnished
to
him
by
the
insurer,
lumbermens.
the
--
a
declaratory
judgment
action
was
then
brought
by
provident
tradesmen
bank
and
trust
company
to
determine
whether
or
not
cionci
was
insured
under
the
permissive
use
clause
of
the
insurance
policy.
this
was
important
because
without
the
coverage
actions
against
cionci
would
be
a
mere
academic
exercise
and
just
would
be
no
funds,
cionci
is
dead
and
there
were
no
assets.
lumbermens
then
moved
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
join
an
indispensable
party
naming
john
l.
harris
and
the
estate
of
thomas
w.
smith
as
such.
the
actions
were
then
amended
to
bring
them
in
and
the
action
went
--
then
went
forward.
at
no
point
thereafter
was
any
motions
made
or
the
issue
raised
as
to
dutcher
being
an
indispensable
party
until
the
court
of
appeals
raised
it
sua
sponte
at
the
argument
after
the
case
had
gone
to
verdict
and
during
argument
on
other
issues.
at
the
trial,
the
question
of
the
interest
of
dutcher
came
up
under
the
pennsylvanian
so-called
dead
man's
rule
which
has
--
justice
goodrich
reviews
in
detail
in
wright
versus
wilson
is
a
holdover
from
the
old
vouch
--
the
old
concept
that
a
man
who
had
some
interest
or
no
matter
how
remote
or
contingent
was
being
nabbed
to
be
able
to
tell
the
truth
in
a
cause
of
action.
we
still
preserve
the
pennsylvania
dead
man's
rule
and
during
the
brief
--
the
colloquies
preceding
their
trial.
it
was
contended
by
counsel
for
the
estate
of
lynch
that
dutcher
had
such
an
interest
as
would
make
him
incompetent
under
the
pennsylvania
dead
man's
rule
and
it
was
contended
by
lumbermen
that
he
did
not
had
such
an
interest.
the
lower
court
ruled
that
dutcher
was
incompetent.
i
should
explain
in
this
case,
at
this
prosecuted
case
despite
the
fact
that
there
had
been
an
attempts
made
at
pretrial
procedure
to
determine
the
amount
of
insurance.
this
was
resisted
by
lumbermens
and
we
had
to
deal
with
philosophical
concepts
rather
than
the
actual
amount
so
that
we
--
that's
why
the
court's
make
allusions
to
finite
limits.
it
was
contended
that
the
interest
of
dutcher
was
such
as
to
render
him
incompetent
under
the
dead
man's
rule
because
they're
being
finite
limits.
dutcher
being
a
party
defendant
to
the
actions
in
the
delaware
county
that
this
would
influence
his
decision
such
as
to
make
him
incompetent
under
the
pennsylvania
dead
man's
rule.
and
of
course
it
was
contended
by
lumbermens
to
the
contrary.
the
action
with
--
dutcher
did
testify
at
the
trial
because
as
to
harris
he
was
not
incompetent.
the
jury
rendered
a
verdict
in
that
cionci
was
operating
the
automobile
within
the
geographical
scope
of
permission.
it
found
dutcher's
testimony
not
credible
as
to
the
court
in
the
--
in
ruling
on
the
post
trial
motions.
there
was
a
directed
verdict
for
the
estate
of
lynch
and
the
estate
of
smith
in
as
much
as
the
pennsylvania
rule,
there
is
a
presumption
that
the
driver
of
the
vehicle,
the
driving
with
this
permission
of
the
owner
and
there
was
no
testimony
for
the
contrary
as
to
those
estates.
when
the
case
came
on
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
issue
of
indispensable
party
having
been
raised
sua
sponte
the
court
then
did
not
rule
for
some
18
months
and
then
had
reargued
and
subsequently
rendered
the
decisions
which
had
brought
us
into
the
court
today.
the
majority
opinion
if
i
may
characterize
it,
have
it
so
briefly
is
that
the
dutcher
is
an
indispensable
party
in
as
much
as
his
interest
will
be
effected
in
as
much
as
he
is
a
defendant
in
the
delaware
county
cases.
mr.
avram
g.
adler
and
they
stopped
right
there.
they
did
not
make
any
further
inquiry.
they
didn't
follow
the
purport
of
the
new
trends
as
to
rule
19.
i
won't
propose
in
this
short
time
to
trace
the
history
of
the
indispensable
party
concept.
this
was
done
brilliantly
by
professor
reid
and
professor
(inaudible),
it
was
originally
a
doctrine
born
in
equity
in
which
equity
would
withhold
its
grace
from
--
unless
all
the
parties
were
before
it
unless
it
could
do
substantial
or
total
justice.
however,
this
concept
when
he
transmigrated
into
the
legal
side
of
the
court
then
became
a
tool
of
legal
oppression
rather
than
of
help.
and
as
a
result
of
the
article
of
greed
and
hazard,
a
tentative
rule
was
proposed
and
circulated
to
setup
various
criteria
if
the
court
should
consider
under
rule
19
before
a
case
was
dismissed
under
the
indispensable
party
concept.
a
research
instructor
at
harvard
by
the
name
of
fink
(ph)
then
wrote
a
contrary
article
saying
that
the
indispensable
party
concept
was
one
of
substantive
law
and
beyond
the
reach
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
these
articles
were
all
before
the
committee
which
tool
the
new
rule
19
and
in
an
unusually
lengthy
notes
and
comments
in
the
new
rule
19.
it
is
clear
that
they
rejected
the
concept,
i
think,
advance
the
arguments
of
greed
and
hazard
and
set
forth
minimum
criteria
which
should
have
been
followed
by
a
court
before
dismissing
under
the
indispensable
party
concept.
it
is
the
complaint
of
the
petitioner
here
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
majority
opinion
did
not
do
this.
and
if
i
may
just
examine
the
various
criteria
by
which
they
could
have
say
this
judgment
and
it
is
a
difficult
case.
it
was
a
case
that
previous
inquiries
have
been
done
and
the
issue
of
coverage
is
crucial.
the
new
rule
19
says
the
first
factor
is
what
does
judgment
bring
--
to
mean
to
the
absentee,
dutcher.
if
anything,
it
is
clearly
to
his
advantage
because
he
gets
a
second
--
if
we
accept
the
fact
that
he
has
an
interest.
he
gets
a
second
opportunity
in
as
much
as
he's
not
bound
by
the
judgment.
but
had
the
judgment
been
adverse
to
the
petitioner
then
we
would
have
been
bound.
dutcher
in
this
action
had
everything
to
gain
and
nothing
to
lose.
if
he
won,
these
foreclosed
the
petitioners.
if
he
lost,
he
still
had
a
second
opportunity
and
this
of
course
was
fully
cognizant
--
fully
aware
--
was
within
the
contemplation
of
the
respondent.
the
second
pragmatic
factor
and
the
rule
maker
--
the
committee
who
fashioned
the
rule
used
the
word
pragmatic
repeatedly
and
it
is
not
as
that
respondent
says
in
it's
a
brief,
a
conclusionary
fact.
it
is
a
seeking
fact,
it
is
an
initial
fact.
it
is
the
--
what
is
good
and
best
for
the
parties,
all
the
parties.
the
second
pragmatic
factor
is
highly
important.
the
interest
of
dutcher
was
highly
remote
and
contingent
and
therefore
the
court
could
have
and
should
have
shaped
the
relief.
they
could
have
very
easily
conditioned
the
judgment
by
merely
saying,
we
will
affirm
the
judgment.
we
will
not
find
dutcher
an
indispensable
party.
we
won't
even
consider
it
if
the
parties
here
agree
to
limit
their
claims
against
all
defendants,
dutcher
or
cionci
to
the
policy
limits
which
have
now
been
admitted
to
be
$100,000.
had
this
been
done
this
case
would've
stopped
right
there.
i
--
as
i
have
said
in
my
brief,
i
am
authorized
and
i
have
been
authorized
to
do
just
that
and
accept
such
a
conditional
one.
and
then
we
don't
have
--
i
have
to
consider
the
interest
of
dutcher
one
bit.
yet,
this
was
never
afforded
the
petitioners.
the
interest
of
dutcher
never
had
to
arise
to
the
dignity
of
an
indispensable
party
concept
had
the
court
merely
followed
the
second
pragmatic
factor
which
new
rule
19
sets
forth
as
minimum
criteria.
i'd
like
at
this
point
--
because
it's
mentioned
in
the
respondent's
brief,
to
explain
the
inconsistencies
if
such
there
be
and
i
hope
to
show
that
there
is
not
between
claiming
the
interest
of
dutcher
so
as
to
preclude
him
from
testifying
under
the
pennsylvania
dead
man's
rule
and
arguing
here
that
is
in
--
in
his
interest
is
remote
and
contingent.
under
pennsylvania
law,
remoteness
and
contingency
as
long
as
the
interest
is
pecuniary
and
adverse
does
not
preclude
him
from
being
found
incompetent
under
the
pennsylvania
dead
man's
rule.
the
best
case
to
cite
that
is
and
i've
chosen
an
extreme
case
is
alcorn
versus
cook
which
is
cited
in
the
brief,
where
the
husband
of
a
legatee
without
any
showing
that
she
might
not
be
able
--
that
there
might
not
be
sufficient
funds
was
precluded
from
testifying.
not
only
was
there
a
remoteness
and
contingency
as
to
whether
there
would
be
sufficient
funds
for
the
legatee.
but
there
was
remoteness
as
to
the
husband's
interest
because
he
would
have
to
survive
the
wife
in
order
to
have
his
interest
brought
into
play.
nevertheless
the
--
under
pennsylvania
law
the
husband
was
found
incompetent
to
testify
under
the
pennsylvania
dead
man's
rule.
now
that's
not
so,
where
you
have
the
indispensable
party
concept.
there
the
interest
must
be
direct
and
crucial.
and
we
submit
that
it's
not
in
this
case.
it
is
significant
that
this
--
as
i
point
out
in
my
brief
that
the
delaware
county
cases
have
never
gotten
out
of
the
pleading
stage
even
after
this
decision.
they
have
lain
dormant
there
for
some
eight
years
and
it
is
significant
that
counsel
for
dutcher
is
furnished
by
the
respondent
here
in
lumbermens
mutual
casualty
company.
they
have
done
nothing
to
resolve
dutcher's
interest.
in
their
brief,
they
say,
well,
the
estate
of
lynch
could
have
brought
these
actions
to
the
court.
this
is
not
so
as
far
as
this
petitioner
is
concerned.
the
personal
representative
of
the
estate
of
lynch
in
this
action
is
not
the
defendant
in
the
delaware
county
cases
as
i
have
pointed
out
in
my
brief.
the
plaintiffs
in
those
cases
had
their
own
personal
representative
for
the
estate
of
lynch
appointed
again
for
the
purposes
of
reaching
the
insurance
statute
and
no
action
was
brought
against
the
estate
of
lynch
as
such
by
its
actual
personal
representative
which
was
provident
tradesmen
bank
and
trust
company.
the
third
factor
which
was
advanced
by
the
advisory
committee
is
whether
an
adequate
judgment
can
be
rendered
in
the
absence
of
dutcher.
we
submit
that
it
can.
the
crucial
issue
was
resolved
which
is
the
permission
of
dutcher.
dutcher
testified
at
this
trial.
this
is
not
a
case
of
someone
who's
--
who
was
not
present.
he
came
into
court.
he
testified.
he
said,
i
didn't
give
them
the
necessary
permission,
the
jury
rejected
his
testimony.
the
fourth
factor
based
by
the
advisory
committee
looks
to
the
practical
effect
of
the
dismissal
and
there
i
asked
this
court
to
look
to
the
minority
opinion,
the
dissenting
opinion
in
this
case.
we
have
now
--
this
has
been
8
years
in
the
courts.
the
issue
has
been
resolved.
to
trudge
back
again
is
a
terrible
burden,
especially
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
a
judgment
can
be
rendered
which
makes
dutcher's
interest
absolutely
known
which
is
to
say,
we
will
uphold
the
judgment
if
the
plaintiffs
agree
to
confine
all
their
claims
against
both
dutcher
and
cionci
to
the
policy
rights.
dutcher
then
has
no
interest
at
all
and
has
no
cause
to
complain.
the
only
one
then
who
has
a
cause
to
complain
is
the
respondent
who
wants
a
second
chance
to
litigate
this
issue.
they've
had
their
day
in
court
and
they
want
to
litigate
it
again.
the
court
unfortunately
after
finding
dutcher
and
then
this
defensible
party
then
went
on
and
said
that
the
lower
court
abused
its
discretion
in
entertaining
the
declaratory
judgment
action.
it
made
one
very
crucial
error
in
this
determination.
it
assumed
that
the
actions
in
delaware
county
were
the
same
as
the
actions
in
the
federal
court
and
this
is
not
so.
the
actions
in
delaware
county,
no
state
court
actions
were
actions
by
the
estate
of
smith
and
living
plaintiff
harris
against
the
estate
of
cionci,
the
estate
of
lynch,
and
dutcher.
the
insurer,
respondent
is
not
a
party
to
the
action.
by
pennsylvania
law
the
question
of
insurance
can't
even
be
brought
up
in
those
actions.
there
would
be
no
inkling
to
the
trier
of
fact
in
those
actions
that
there
was
any
insurance
involved.
and
the
court
of
appeals
completely
overlooks
the
very
important
thing
that
this
declaratory
judgment
action
is
not
only
proper
but
we
believe
it
would
have
been
a
--
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
refuse
to
entertain
it
because
the
--
a
single
crucial
issue
is
here
being
determined
which
changes
an
academic
exercise
into
a
very
real
and
vital
thing.
and
i
might
also
point
out
that
this
declaratory
judgment
action
also
benefits
dutcher
because
as
were
shown
in
the
action
by
the
estate
of
lynch,
lumbermens
never
defended
that
action.
if
this
judgment
is
upheld
then
lumbermens
will
vigorously
defend
against
the
plaintiff's
actions
in
the
delaware
county
case
thus,
limiting
the
--
or
attempting
to
limit
the
exposure
of
cionci
and
to
preserve
what
is
left
for
dutcher.
i
might
point
out
that
the
case
against
dutcher
in
the
delaware
county
cases
based
upon
the
record
which
we
have
here
is
very
naked
and
very
remote.
dutcher
handed
the
keys
and
lent
the
car
to
cionci
and
lynch.
there's
no
other
connection
with
the
case.
he
wasn't
present
during
the
accident.
in
the
defendant's
brief,
they
has
say,
well,
maybe
the
brakes
were
bad
and
there
is
an
allegation
and
the
complaint
that
brakes
were
bad.
but
if
the
testimony
in
the
court
below,
nothing
was
ever
said
about
brakes,
i
don't
submit
however
that
that's
a
controlling
issue
in
the
light
of
the
arguments
i've
made
here
before.
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time?
mr.
avram
g.
adler
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps
i
spoke
too
quickly
in
my
first
opportunity
to
address
the
jury
and
i
did
not
give
the
antecedent
history
as
clearly
as
i
should
have
done.
counsel
representing
the
estate
of
lynch
brought
a
suit
against
the
estate
of
cionci
who
was
the
driver
and
it's
now
admitted
that
he
was
the
driver.
in
an
investigation
showed
that
cionci
had
no
assets
whatsoever.
these
were
all
very
serious
and
reasonable.
the
estate
of
lynch
then
brought
a
declaratory
judgment
action
against
lumbermens
to
determine
whether
there
would
be
coverage
for
cionci
so
that
this
suit
would
not
be
a
mere
academic
exercise.
the
lumbermens
then
motioned
to
bring
in
all
the
other
injured
parties,
dutcher
was
never
brought
in,
and
the
suit
went
forward
on
that
basis
and
a
jury
found
coverage
as
to
--
by
the
record
verdict
and
by
an
actual
verdict
on
the
evidence,
a
jury
found
coverage.
mr.
avram
g.
adler
lumebermens
mutual
insurance
company
to
bring
in
the
other
claimants,
at
no
time
even
at
the
pre-trial,
the
day
requested
dutcher
be
brought
in
as
an
indispensable
party.
there
is
no
question
that
dutcher
would
be
a
plaintiff
in
this
case.
they
answer
mr.
white
because
by
mr.
harvey's
own
admission,
there
is
a
per
--
there
is
a
potential
conflict
between
dutcher
and
the
insurance
company
so
that
he
would
be
a
possible
--
mr.
avram
g.
adler
that
could
have
been
done
had
the
issue
been
raised.
it
was
not
raised
--
mr.
avram
g.
adler
he
could
be
either
--
on
either
side
and
this
is
a
question
that
troubled
me
a
great
deal.
mr.
avram
g.
adler
well,
as
mr.
harvey
pointed
out,
he
says
that
if
dutcher
loses
in
the
delaware
country
actions,
he
would
then
have
a
suit
against
lumbermen
which
then
indicates
a
potential
conflict
between
lumbermens
and
dutcher
and
therefore
he
could
be
a
made
a
plaintiff.
and
therefore,
under
no
circumstances,
just
to
cover
the
approach
that
your
honor
made
yesterday.
at
best,
the
court
could
have
under
19
(a)
merely
sent
the
case
back
to
include
dutcher
as
an
involuntary
plaintiff.
the
majority
opinion
for
reasons
which
we
do
not
understand
seemed
intended
to
establish
a
substantive
complex
and
to
work
the
thrust
of
the
modern
approach
in
rule
19.
but
if
i
may
just
briefly
sketch
this
--
the
approaches
that
we
--
that
are
to
be
taken,
if
the
majority
opinion
approach
is
taken,
then
there
will
not
be
just
a
possible
conflict
as
mr.
harvey
points
out.
but
there
will
be
three
poss
--
or
four
possible
conflicts,
because
under
pennsylvania
rules,
each
of
these
cases
would
be
litigated
and
then
each
of
these
various
claimants
would
then
have
to
bring
a
separate
garnishment
action
and
you
could
get
three
separate
conflicting
approaches
as
to
the
coverage
question,
which
would
be
a
sheer
nightmare.
the
declaratory
judgment
action
in
this
case
was
the
most
economical
way
of
determining
the
issue.
now,
under
19
(a),
if
your
honors
were
to
send
it
back
under
19
(a)
to
make
ducther
an
involuntary
plaintiff,
then
being
the
law
of
the
case
that
the
pennsylvania
dead
man's
rule
applies.
and
by
sending
it
back
under
19
(a),
the
court
recognizes
the
interest
of
dutcher
and
it
has
been
argued
here
as
to
the
interest
of
dutcher
by
counsel
for
the
insurance
company,
then
it
means
the
various
estates
would
prevail
because
under
the
pennsylvania
presumption,
dutcher
could
not
testify
and
again
they
would
get
their
directive
verdict.
and
the
only
person
who
could
suffer
would
be
the
live
plaintiff
who
was
severely
injured
and
he
might
get
a
conflicting
result.
and
lumbermens
gets
an
opportunity
to
relitigate
that
issue
and
submit
that
again
toa
jury
which
i
humbly
submit
they
do
not
deserve.
they've
had
their
day
in
court.
under
no
circumstances
can
dutcher
suffer.
now,
it
has
been
argued
that
dutcher
may
be
found
a
defendant
in
the
delaware
county
cases
and
then
he
can
sue
the
insurance
company.
but
as
your
honors
pointed
out,
only
the
insurance
company
would
suffer
thereby.
but
even
under
those
circumstances,
under
the
opinion
suggested
--
under
the
order
suggested
by
judge
freedman
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
the
judgment
here
would
await
the
resolution
of
those
delaware
county
cases.
if
dutcher
is
found
not
guilty
in
this
action,
and
there's
a
good
chance
of
that
because
all
he
did
was
hand
the
keys
to
these
men
and
these
men
took
the
car
away
and
cionci
was
driving
at
90
miles
an
hour
and
crossed
the
median
strip,
the
likelihood
that
dutcher
would
be
found
guilty
as
a
defendant
is
highly
unlikely.
and
if
he
is
found
absolved
in
those
delaware
county
cases,
then
there
is
no
conflict
at
all.
and
lumbermens
pays
the
--
judgment
that
been
found
in
these
cases.
and
it
is
significant
as
i
pointed
out
yesterday
that
despite
the
fact
that
lumbermens
represents
dutcher
in
those
cases,
those
cases
have
stayed
on
the
books
for
eight
years
even
though
delaware
county
is
a
short
docket
county
and
they've
done
nothing
to
resolve
it.
but
taking
judge
freedman's
opinion
one
step
further,
we
as
the
counsel
for
the
claimants
and
the
counsel
for
all
claimants
are
in
this
court
today,
we
are
willing
to
accept
a
conditional
order
which
says
that
we
will
limit
our
claims
against
all
the
defendants
including
dutcher
to
the
$100,000
policy.
so
that
by
affirming
the
order
of
the
lower
court
and
making
it
conditional,
then
dutcher
has
no
danger
at
all
and
in
fact
he
hasn't
any,
and
lumbermens
has
no
danger
of
paying
out
more
than
their
contractual
limit.
and
this
can
be
done
under
19
(b),
the
whole
thrust,
and
that's
the
importance
of
this
case.
ninth
--
new
rule
19
set
up
various
means
by
which
this
whole
concept
of
indispensable
party
can
be
put
aside
for
pragmatic
considerations.
and
the
rule
makers
kept
using
that
word
pragmatic
consideration.
it
is
not
at
all
unknown
for
a
court
to
so
do,
to
put
a
condition
on
the
affirmance
of
an
order.
and
we
would
accept
such
a
condition.
and
under
that
posture,
and
we
set
this
in
our
brief,
lumbermens
has
not
met
that
challenge.
they
have
not
answered
this
premise
as
i
advanced
yesterday
and
as
i
advanced
now,
the
reason
for
that
is
that
lumbermens
wants
to
relitigate
this
thing.
they
want
a
second
day
in
court.
and
i
say
to
your
honors,
this
case
has
been
on
the
books
for
nine
years
and
it
was
no
fault
to
the
plaintiffs
that
it
was
on
the
books
for
nine
years.
the
court
of
appeals
sat
on
this
case
for
almost
two
years
for
reasons
which
we
do
not
understand
and
then
ordered
an
argument
in
bond.
this
case
was
ordered
on
the
trial
list
within
five
months
after
it
was
first
filed,
so
that
we
have
not
delayed,
but
it
has
been
in
courts
for
a
long
time.
this
court
has
within
its
power,
the
opportunity
to
terminate
this
litigation
by
making
such
a
conditional
order
and
all
counsel
have
authorized
me
to
say
that
they
would
accept
such
a
condition,
that
all
the
claims
of
all
the
plaintiffs
will
be
limited
to
the
insurance
coverage
of
a
$100,000.
the
issue
has
been
litigated
under
--
the
importance
of
this
case
is
that
the
rule
19
gives
the
opportunity
to
the
courts
to
use
these
pragmatic
considerations
to
be
practical
as
opposed
to
the
impractical.
and
this
is
the
first
important
case
under
rule
19,
and
this
case
could
be
a
guide
stone
to
the
lower
courts
in
getting
away
from
this
rigid
approach
to
the
indispensable
party
context.
mr.
avram
g.
adler
thank
you.
mr.
avram
g.
adler
that
--
mr.
avram
g.
adler
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
19
(a)
would
prevail.
however,
if
there
were
no
means
by
which
this
case
can
be
terminated
now,
if
we
go
back
under
19
(a),
there
is
a
chance
of
injustice
to
harris.
however
this
court
by
a
conditional
order,
and
19
(b)
does
give
that
opportunity,
could
say
we
affirm
this
judgment
under
conditions
that
the
plaintiffs
agree
or
signed
a
certificate
or
a
motion
that
they
will
limit
their
claims
to
all
the
defendants
$200,000
and
that
terminates
the
litigation
and
either
dutcher
nor
the
defendant
can
be
hurt
thereby.
they've
had
their
day
in
court.
mr.
avram
g.
adler
no
sir,
i
did
not
because
this
was
raised
sua
sponte
at
the
first
argument
and
at
the
second
argument
we
argue
that
the
question
that
the
dutcher
is
being
an
indispensable
party.
i
did
make
it
however
your
honors
in
my
brief
in
this
case,
perhaps
i
should
have
made
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
avram
g.
adler
i
represent
the
--
mr.
avram
g.
adler
i
represent
the
estate
of
lynch
and
counsel
--
mr.
avram
g.
adler
i
--
and
counsel
for
the
other
two
parties.
the
estate
of
smith
and
harris
is
in
court
and
is
present
and
he
joins
with
me
in
that
offer
to
the
court.
and
i
have
so
stated
it
in
my
brief.
mr.
avram
g.
adler
mr.
nelson
who
is
counsel
for
the
other
two
claimants
joined
with
me
in
that.
we
seek
to
terminate
this
litigation
and
we
submit
that
this
is
an
opportunity
under
the
practical
aspects
of
rule
19
to
solve
it.
thank
you
your
honors.
