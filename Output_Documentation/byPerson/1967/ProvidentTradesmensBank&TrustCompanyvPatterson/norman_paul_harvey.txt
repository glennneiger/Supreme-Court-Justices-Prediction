mr.
norman
paul
harvey
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
if
we
may
consider
initially
the
comments
made
by
counsel
with
respect
to
the
error
of
judge
kalodner
in
the
court
of
appeals,
judge
kalodner
did
not
mistake
when
he
said
that
all
of
these
matters
could
be
decided
in
delaware
county,
common
pleas
court.
judge
kalodner
is
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
one
does
not
try
coverage
actions
and
tort
actions
at
the
same
time
in
pennsylvania.
and
i
think
a
clear
reading
of
his
opinion
indicates
that
what
he
was
saying
was
that
every
single
person
that
should
be
a
party
to
this
action
was
present
in
delaware
county
and
all
of
the
actions
could
have
been
brought
there
and
tried
there
and
decided
there.
and
it
would
not
have
been
necessary
to
bring
any
separate
declaratory
judgment
action
either
in
the
state
court
or
the
federal
court
for
the
simple
reason
that
upon
obtaining
a
verdict
in
the
state
court
in
the
negligence
action,
a
garnishment
proceeding
could
immediately
have
been
brought
against
the
lumbermens
mutual
casualty
company.
and
at
the
rate
at
which
matters
moved
in
delaware
county,
this
whole
matter
would
have
decided
about
five
or
six
years
ago.
if
for
the
purpose
of
its
own
strategy
the
petitioner
here
wanted
to
maneuver
this
entire
litigation
in
the
fashion
in
which
it
has
been
maneuvered.
then
it
would
seem
essential
that
he
should
fall
if
--
even
if
it
were
said
that
he
is
falling
on
a
technicality
because
it's
of
his
own
manufacture.
now,
assuming
without
deciding
or
without
contending
that
the
majority
opinion
would
seem
to
indicate
perhaps
that
the
court
has
gone
beyond
its
rule
making
power
or
at
least
that
is
the
way
to
induct
minority
seem
to
want
to
treat
it.
it's
submitted
that
irrespective
of
how
one
views
rule
19,
this
case
is
properly
dismissed
by
the
majority
because
under
the
most
liberal
interpretation
of
rule
19,
this
case
does
not
meet
the
criteria
enunciated
by
this
court,
enunciated
in
rule
19
and
if
you
will
by
(inaudible)
and
the
other
scholarly
writers
of
law
review
articles.
in
this
case,
dutcher
is
--
if
he
is
--
if
anything
appears
to
dutcher,
he's
deprived
of
50%
of
the
coverage
he
build
up.
if
that's
not
the
situation
and
that
he
is
in
no
way
bound
by
this
judgment
to
which
he
was
not
a
party
then
the
lumbermens
mutual
casualty
company
has
a
potential
exposure
above
the
amount
of
its
policy
to
the
extent
that
it
has
to
under
this
decision
of
the
--
from
which
the
appeal
was
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
more
liability
for
payment
of
money
that
he
never
contracted
for.
because
if
dutcher
us
not
bound
by
the
district
court
judgment
that
which
says
that
lumbermens
must
pay
50%
or
$50,000
of
its
coverage
he
then
can
say
to
the
lumbermens
mutual
casualty
company
in
the
event
of
verdicts
against
him
in
delaware
county,
you
can't
take
any
credit
for
that
$50,000
because
i
wasn't
there.
i
wasn't
a
party.
therefore,
you'll
have
to
pay
whatever
you
paid
for
cionci
and
whatever
above
that
is
necessarily
to
satisfy
any
judgments
against
me.
now
the
contention
that
dutcher
doesn't
stand
in
any
danger
is
very
unrealistic
because
testimony
can
be
brought
in
at
any
time
that
would
show
that
there
was
an
agency
relationship.
also,
testimony
can
be
presented
in
the
tort
actions
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
his
automobile.
any
proofs
along
those
lines
would
be
consistent
with
the
pleadings
in
the
case.
the
fact
that
up
to
this
time
no
one
knows
of
any
such
witnesses
isn't
controlling
because
certainly
in
our
trial
experience,
we've
seen
witnesses
come
that
had
never
been
expected
long
after
--
all
of
discovery
proceedings
were
completed.
appear
over
weekends
after
interrogatories
in
the
supplemental
interrogatories.
so
dutcher
does
have
a
potential
liability
in
the
delaware
county
action.
now
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
that
was
suggested
by
judge
freeman
in
his
dissenting
opinion.
if
the
court
were
to
enter
a
--
an
order
tailored
to
this
case
in
which
it
said
now
the
lynch's
estate
or
provident
tradesmen
cannot
execute
on
this
judgment
until
dutcher's
liability
is
decided
in
the
other
cases.
it's
entirely
possible
and
likely
necessary
in
order
to
protect
the
entire
situation.
for
actions
to
be
broad
in
which
a
contrary
result
is
sought
because
with
dutcher
as
a
plaintiff
in
delaware
county
before
a
jury,
it's
very
likely
that
a
judgment
can
--
a
verdict
and
subsequent
judgment
can
be
obtained
which
will
hold
that
cionci
is
not
entitled
to
coverage
under
lumbermens
policy.
so
that
--
what
this
court
said
in
the
pacific
casualty
case
would
then
be
a
reality
and
there's
nothing
that
any
decree
that's
entered
by
the
court
of
appeals,
there's
nothing
that
it
can
do
to
prevent
a
judgment
in
delaware
county
completely
different
than
the
judgment
here
with
respect
to
the
coverage
owing
cionci.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
there
was
no
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
don't
--
he
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
don't
think
there
would
have
been
any
problem
if
someone
had
moved
to
bring
him
in
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
yes.
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
diversity
between
cionci
and
dutcher.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
would
think
your
honor
if
the
parties
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
--
had
wanted
to
bring
him
in,
they
could
have
brought
him
in.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
there
wouldn't
be
any
diversity
then
between
dutcher
and
cionci.
that
a
main
claim
recovery
just
between
cionci
and
dutcher,
cionci
was
the
driver
of
the
automobile
and
dutcher
was
the
owner
and
the
primary
question
is
who
--
which
of
those
two
is
entitled
to
recovery
to
the
policy
and
there
would
be
no
diversity
between
them.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
in
the
federal
court,
sir?
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
in
the
federal
court,
the
provident
tradesmen
bank
and
trust
and
so
forth,
having
been
named
administrator
of
the
estate
of
a
man
named
lynch
who
was
riding
in
the
car
brought
the
declaratory
judgment
action
against
the
estate
of
donald
cionci
who
was
the
driver
and
the
lumbermens
mutual
casualty
company.
later
on,
the
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
they've
brought
this
declaratory
judgment
action
to
declare
the
coverage
of
the
lumbermens'
policy
was
available
to
donald
cionci.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
one
judgment
had
been
obtained
against
cionci
in
the
federal
court
before
this
declaratory
judgment
action
was
brought
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
not
the
judgment
action,
no,
sir.
that
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
--
that's
a
separate
action.
the
action
in
which
the
$50,000
judgment
was
obtained
is
not
touched
by
the
matter
now
before
your
honors.
that
was
an
action
sounding
in
tort
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
they
dismissed
the
declaratory
judgment
action.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
think
the
reasoning
of
the
majority
was
that
in
fact
dutcher
had
a
substantive
right
to
be
a
party
since
he
was
in
the
party
and
said,
his
interest
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
sir?
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
because
he
wasn't
a
party.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
don't
know
whether
anyone
thought
of
doing
that
certainly
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
--
the
minority
didn't
decide
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
if
the
case
is
dismissed
the
advantage
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
the
insurance
carrier.
if
the
case
is
dismissed
the
advantage
the
insurance
carrier
is
that
there
won't
be
contrary
judgments
in
different
jurisdictions
interpreting
the
policy
in
this
particular
case
differently.
if
the
action
that
was
brought
--
the
declaratory
judgment
action
that
was
brought
and
the
result
achieved
in
a
district
court
is
permitted
to
stand
then
in
that
case
it
will
be
said
that
the
lumbermens
has
to
give
coverage
to
cionci.
but
if
an
action
is
brought
in
delaware
county
and
raises
the
coverage
question,
it
can
very
well
be
decided
exactly
the
contrary.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
the
accident
happened
in
1959.
first,
there
were
suits
started
out
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
well,
that's
what
it
was
sir.
it
was
an
automobile
accident
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
don't
think
the
lawyers
did
it
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
think
the
fact
that
there
wasn't
the
--
a
necessary
diversity
in
the
federal
court
action
in
order
to
enable
the
jointer
of
dutcher
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
--
is
what
caused
the
problems.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
in
the
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
in
the
district
court?
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
there
was
the
estate
of
lynch
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
--
and
that's
represented
by
provident
tradesmen.
then
there
was
a
personal
representative
of
another
injured
--
of
a
deceased
party
and
an
injured
party.
those
three
people
were
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
the
defendant
was
the
lumbermens
mutual
casualty
company,
a
corporation
formed
in
illinois
and
having
a
principal
place
of
business
there.
the
estate
of
cionci
which
originally
had
a
pennsylvania
representative
but
then
later
on
got
a
jersey
representative
so
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
against
the
lumbermens?
there
wouldn't
be
--
there
be
diversity
as
to
lumbermens
but
not
as
to
cionci.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
maybe
i
was
--
there
would
have
been
diversity
with
the
out
of
state
administrator
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
--
between
dutcher
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
if
dutcher
were
a
plaintiff,
there
could
have
been.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
--
but
they
never
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
that's
correct.
but
the
difficulty
is
the
--
from
the
standpoint
of
people
who
brought
the
action
was
that
if
they
made
dutcher
a
party,
they
would
have
a
different
situation
with
respect
to
the
interest.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
well,
then
i
would
think
sir
that
the
matter
would
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
but
that
was
never
done
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
think
it
is
properly
before
the
court
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
no,
i
think
then
that
we'd
have
to
try
the
case
on
that
theory.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
oh,
i
think
dutcher
would
then
have
a
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel
so
that
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
sir?
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
well,
and
he
wasn't
represented
by
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
yes.
just
try
the
declaratory
judgment
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
it
didn't
at
the
last
trial
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
sir?
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
well,
that
has
no
bearing
on
the
fact
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
that
dutcher
had
no
counsel
and
was
not
a
party.
i
would
agree
with
your
honor
that
if
he
could
be
joined
as
a
plaintiff
and
given
an
opportunity
to
appear
with
counsel
in
the
case
tried
that
would
probably
be
a
solution.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
wouldn't
think
that
it
really
ordered
the
court
to
do
that,
not
necessarily
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
maybe
that
would
have
been
for
the
district
court
to
do
but
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
can
take
the
action
which
has
already
been
tried
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
the
district
court
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
think
that
could
have
been
done.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
should
think
so
too.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
as
far
as
the
coverage
sir?
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
would
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
would
think
that
it'd
be
in
pennsylvania
20
years.
it's
a
contract
under
seal.
the
question
is
a
contractual
of
question
so
far
as
coverage
is
concerned.
they
could
--
the
rule
in
pennsylvania
is
that
a
contract
under
seal
is
certainly
good
at
least
for
20
years
in
the
statute
of
limitation
within
the
breach
would
be
bad.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
in
the
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
in
the
judgment
--
in
the
declaratory
judgment
action?
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
the
defense
was
that
cionci
did
not
have
permission
to
go
down
to
media
with
dutcher's
automobile.
cionci
having
been
given
permission
to
go
from
brentmore
to
ardmore
which
isn't
really
a
long
walk
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
oh,
no.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
no,
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
no,
sir.
chicago,
illinois.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
illinois.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
well,
for
diversity
purposes.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
it's
illinois,
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
it's
found
in
illinois.
its
and
illinois
--
it's
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
the
principal
place
of
business
is
in
illinois.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
yes.
your
honor,
i
think
it's
referring
to
the
principal
place
of
business
test.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
but
i
say
the
principal
place
of
business
is
illinois.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
judge
whom
sir?
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
he
was
not
on
this
court.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
the
dissent
was
by
a
judge
freedman
and
there
was
concurrence
but
no
opinion
by
judge
ganey.
the
other
five
were
unanimous
in
their
holding
and
the
opinion
was
by
judge
kalodner.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
(inaudible)
pennsylvania.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
the
question
that
was
tried
--
that
was
argued
before
judge
freedman
was
pennsylvania
law
so
far
as
the
evidence
rule
was
concerned
--
the
evidence
rule
involved
and
other
ramifications
of
permission
but
his
decision
is
primarily
on
rule
19.
and
in
addition
to
that,
he
makes
some
comments
about
the
pennsylvania
rule
which
we
don't
agree
with
but
that's
enough
before
you.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
no,
i
think
he
was
really
indicating
that
under
rule
19
it
shouldn't
be
dismissed.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
sir,
in
summary
of
what
was
said
yesterday
and
in
our
brief.
the
suggested
order
of
the
minority
of
the
third
circuit
would
by
the
very
order
suggested
contemplate
additional
litigation.
it
contemplates
litigation
by
the
party
who
was
not
a
--
the
person
who
not
a
party
in
order
to
resolve
his
right.
it
is
quite
possible
that
in
asserting
his
rights,
either
in
a
federal
court
or
in
a
state
court
a
conclusion
directly
contrary
to
the
conclusion
reached
in
the
instant
case
in
the
district
court
could
be
reached.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
then
it
would
have
one
decision
saying
that
there
was
no
coverage
for
cionci.
you
would
have
another
decision
saying
it
was
coverage
for
cionci.
and
these
two
decisions
would
be
in
conflict.
the
order
of
the
court
doesn't
say
what
it
would
do
in
that
situation
where
the
proposed
order
of
the
minority
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
the
impact
on
dutcher
is
that
he
may
be
completely
lost
with
no
coverage
due
to
the
fact
of
the
decision
in
one
of
these
courts.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
yes
sir.
if
dutcher
should
prevail
in
a
coverage
case
in
delaware
county,
under
that,
he
would
be
in
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
that
is
if
he
should
obtain
a
verdict
in
an
action
against
the
lumbermens
and
cionci.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
that
there
was
no
coverage
for
cionci
then,
dutcher
would
be
entitled
to
the
entire
fund
that
he
had
provided
by
purchasing
a
policy.
however,
at
the
same
time,
there
would
be
a
finding
in
the
district
court,
federal
district
court
in
philadelphia
that
cionci
was
entitled
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
--
to
the
coverage
of
the
policy.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
think
also
your
honor
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
think
it's
true
if
you
conclude
that
the
carrier
is
going
to
have
to
suffer
double
liability,
yes.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
oh,
i
think
sir,
even
under
rule
19
as
amended,
consideration
must
be
given
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
somebody
is
going
to
suffer
double
liability
because
of
the
holding
in
the
case
where
a
party
should
--
a
person
should
be
a
party
and
is
not
a
party.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
not
necessarily.
i
would
--
in
reading
the
rule,
i
didn't
get
that
impression
sir
and
in
reading
the
articles
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
don't
think
they
did,
i
don't
think
the
minority
opinion
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
as
far
as
the
judgment
standing,
it
isn't
the
position
of
the
respondent
here
that
the
majority
opinion
necessarily
has
to
prevail.
if
there
is
another
way
in
this
same
action
of
bringing
to
a
conclusion
the
coverage
question
in
a
decision
that's
binding
on
dutcher,
who
is
the
name
ensured
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
that
has
not
been
contended
by
anyone.
the
majority
says
he
is
not
bound
by
it.
the
dissenting
opinion
says
that
dutcher
is
not
bound
by
it
and
dutcher
is
not
a
party.
so
i
don't
think
that
the
court
had
any
jurisdiction
of
him
and
i
don't
think
it
could
be
said
that
because
in
an
action
in
which
he
was
not
a
party,
his
insurance
carrier
lost
a
contract
action
that
he
is
bound
by
that
situation.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
think
it
goes
much
further
than
that
your
honor
and
i
think
my
time
is
running
out.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
think
that
the
overall
importance
of
this
case
is
not
this
one
decision
but
the
fact
that
the
federal
declaratory
judgment
act
has
been
a
great
help
in
solving
problems
and
in
cutting
down
litigation.
and
in
the
insurance
field
of
making
it
unnecessary
to
go
through
the
extensive
trial
of
tort
action
because
frequently
when
a
decision
has
arrived
at
on
the
coverage,
then
settlements
are
worked
out.
the
federal
declaratory
judgment
act
is
often
available
when
no
state
act
is
available.
if
a
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
if
he
has
joined
as
a
defendant,
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
diversity
if
he
were
made
a
defendant
if
he
were
in
the
case
as
a
plaintiff.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
well,
we
were
in
no
way
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
--
connected
with
the
case
then,
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
lumbermens
lost?
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
no
sir
because
we
never
did
raise
the
point.
the
point
was
raised
by
the
court
of
appeals
sua
sponte.
we
felt
we
are
perfectly
right
on
the
pennsylvania
law
and
had
every
right
to
reverse
the
district
court.
we
did
not
raise
the
indispensable
party.
that
was
raised
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
that
might
be
so
except
that
dutcher
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
don't
know
the
rationale
that
was
followed
in
not
joining
dutcher.
if
we
had
been
involved
in
the
case
at
that
stage,
i
doubt
that
i
would
have
joined
dutcher
because
i
don't
think
an
insurance
company
having
a
fiduciary
relationship
to
its
insured
has
any
right
to
bring
its
insured
into
litigation
that
will
bind
him.
if
other
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
--
party
would
want
to
bind
him
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
my
position
is
not
that
he
should
be
joined.
my
position
is
that
if
he
joined
as
was
suggested
from
the
bench
yesterday
by
the
court,
then
the
lumbermens
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
and
dutcher
will
be
represented
in
the
action
in
the
lower
court.
there
is
no
controversy
at
this
time
between
dutcher,
the
name
insured
and
his
insurance
carrier,
the
lumbermens,
no
controversy
exists
there.
now
i
would
like
to
say,
if
i
may
sir
this
final
word
that
if
any
stamp
of
approval
of
this
court
is
placed
on
this
limited
sort
of
piecemeal
handling
of
this
coverage
problem,
without
overstating
it,
it's
going
to
have
a
nationwide
effect,
because
throughout
the
country,
these
suits
are
started
all
the
time
to
decide
coverage
problems.
and
if
they
can
be
started
and
the
person
that
is
important
to
a
litigation
as
dutcher
can't
be
joined
and
it's
going
to
be
a
piecemeal
decision
of
the
coverage
question
which
will
encourage
more
litigation
of
the
same
question,
then
the
efficacy
of
the
declaratory
judgment
action
is
going
to
be
lost
on
a
50-state
basis.
i
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
but
if
your
honor
please,
it
seems
to
me,
in
reading
the
articles
that
probably
prompted
this
new
rule
19
that
they
contemplate,
and
then
to
the
litigation
which
is
somewhat
synonymous
with
the
contemplation
of
declaratory
judgment
act
that
it
should
be
final
and
decisive
and
not
a
piecemeal
situation
after
the
declaratory
judgment
action
is
over.
and
i
suggest
to
you
your
honor
that
the
answer
is
not
to
have
people
such
as
the
lumbermens
who
have
no
controversy
with
another
person
such
as
this
named
insured
at
its
parallel
to
drag
that
person
into
litigation
and
force
him
to
engage
counsel
by
the
action
of
the
insurance
carrier
which
is
suppose
to
protect
that
name.
i
think
it's
the
obligation
of
the
person
bringing
this
action
to
bring
it
properly.
another
point
sir
that
is
stressed
in
all
the
cases
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
but
sir,
i
only
can
say,
to
--
with
regards
to
that
that
dutcher
is
an
innocent
party,
he
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
he
became
a
party
or
not.
and
he's
certainly
going
to
be
put
because
of
litigation
personally,
if
there
is
an
order
such
as
suggested
by
the
minority
of
the
third
circuit.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i'm
not
reading
that
into
the
minority
opinion
and
minority
opinion
specifically
contemplates
dutcher's
starting
further
litigation.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
that
was
in
the
federal
court,
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
it
was
tried
at
the
same
time.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
he
did
testify,
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
yes,
he
was
called
by
counsel
in
representing
the
carrier.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
if
we
may
consider
initially
the
comments
made
by
counsel
with
respect
to
the
error
of
judge
kalodner
in
the
court
of
appeals,
judge
kalodner
did
not
mistake
when
he
said
that
all
of
these
matters
could
be
decided
in
delaware
county,
common
pleas
court.
judge
kalodner
is
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
one
does
not
try
coverage
actions
and
tort
actions
at
the
same
time
in
pennsylvania.
and
i
think
a
clear
reading
of
his
opinion
indicates
that
what
he
was
saying
was
that
every
single
person
that
should
be
a
party
to
this
action
was
present
in
delaware
county
and
all
of
the
actions
could
have
been
brought
there
and
tried
there
and
decided
there.
and
it
would
not
have
been
necessary
to
bring
any
separate
declaratory
judgment
action
either
in
the
state
court
or
the
federal
court
for
the
simple
reason
that
upon
obtaining
a
verdict
in
the
state
court
in
the
negligence
action,
a
garnishment
proceeding
could
immediately
have
been
brought
against
the
lumbermens
mutual
casualty
company.
and
at
the
rate
at
which
matters
moved
in
delaware
county,
this
whole
matter
would
have
decided
about
five
or
six
years
ago.
if
for
the
purpose
of
its
own
strategy
the
petitioner
here
wanted
to
maneuver
this
entire
litigation
in
the
fashion
in
which
it
has
been
maneuvered.
then
it
would
seem
essential
that
he
should
fall
if
--
even
if
it
were
said
that
he
is
falling
on
a
technicality
because
it's
of
his
own
manufacture.
now,
assuming
without
deciding
or
without
contending
that
the
majority
opinion
would
seem
to
indicate
perhaps
that
the
court
has
gone
beyond
its
rule
making
power
or
at
least
that
is
the
way
to
induct
minority
seem
to
want
to
treat
it.
it's
submitted
that
irrespective
of
how
one
views
rule
19,
this
case
is
properly
dismissed
by
the
majority
because
under
the
most
liberal
interpretation
of
rule
19,
this
case
does
not
meet
the
criteria
enunciated
by
this
court,
enunciated
in
rule
19
and
if
you
will
by
(inaudible)
and
the
other
scholarly
writers
of
law
review
articles.
in
this
case,
dutcher
is
--
if
he
is
--
if
anything
appears
to
dutcher,
he's
deprived
of
50%
of
the
coverage
he
build
up.
if
that's
not
the
situation
and
that
he
is
in
no
way
bound
by
this
judgment
to
which
he
was
not
a
party
then
the
lumbermens
mutual
casualty
company
has
a
potential
exposure
above
the
amount
of
its
policy
to
the
extent
that
it
has
to
under
this
decision
of
the
--
from
which
the
appeal
was
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
more
liability
for
payment
of
money
that
he
never
contracted
for.
because
if
dutcher
us
not
bound
by
the
district
court
judgment
that
which
says
that
lumbermens
must
pay
50%
or
$50,000
of
its
coverage
he
then
can
say
to
the
lumbermens
mutual
casualty
company
in
the
event
of
verdicts
against
him
in
delaware
county,
you
can't
take
any
credit
for
that
$50,000
because
i
wasn't
there.
i
wasn't
a
party.
therefore,
you'll
have
to
pay
whatever
you
paid
for
cionci
and
whatever
above
that
is
necessarily
to
satisfy
any
judgments
against
me.
now
the
contention
that
dutcher
doesn't
stand
in
any
danger
is
very
unrealistic
because
testimony
can
be
brought
in
at
any
time
that
would
show
that
there
was
an
agency
relationship.
also,
testimony
can
be
presented
in
the
tort
actions
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
his
automobile.
any
proofs
along
those
lines
would
be
consistent
with
the
pleadings
in
the
case.
the
fact
that
up
to
this
time
no
one
knows
of
any
such
witnesses
isn't
controlling
because
certainly
in
our
trial
experience,
we've
seen
witnesses
come
that
had
never
been
expected
long
after
--
all
of
discovery
proceedings
were
completed.
appear
over
weekends
after
interrogatories
in
the
supplemental
interrogatories.
so
dutcher
does
have
a
potential
liability
in
the
delaware
county
action.
now
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
that
was
suggested
by
judge
freeman
in
his
dissenting
opinion.
if
the
court
were
to
enter
a
--
an
order
tailored
to
this
case
in
which
it
said
now
the
lynch's
estate
or
provident
tradesmen
cannot
execute
on
this
judgment
until
dutcher's
liability
is
decided
in
the
other
cases.
it's
entirely
possible
and
likely
necessary
in
order
to
protect
the
entire
situation.
for
actions
to
be
broad
in
which
a
contrary
result
is
sought
because
with
dutcher
as
a
plaintiff
in
delaware
county
before
a
jury,
it's
very
likely
that
a
judgment
can
--
a
verdict
and
subsequent
judgment
can
be
obtained
which
will
hold
that
cionci
is
not
entitled
to
coverage
under
lumbermens
policy.
so
that
--
what
this
court
said
in
the
pacific
casualty
case
would
then
be
a
reality
and
there's
nothing
that
any
decree
that's
entered
by
the
court
of
appeals,
there's
nothing
that
it
can
do
to
prevent
a
judgment
in
delaware
county
completely
different
than
the
judgment
here
with
respect
to
the
coverage
owing
cionci.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
there
was
no
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
don't
--
he
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
don't
think
there
would
have
been
any
problem
if
someone
had
moved
to
bring
him
in
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
yes.
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
diversity
between
cionci
and
dutcher.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
would
think
your
honor
if
the
parties
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
--
had
wanted
to
bring
him
in,
they
could
have
brought
him
in.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
there
wouldn't
be
any
diversity
then
between
dutcher
and
cionci.
that
a
main
claim
recovery
just
between
cionci
and
dutcher,
cionci
was
the
driver
of
the
automobile
and
dutcher
was
the
owner
and
the
primary
question
is
who
--
which
of
those
two
is
entitled
to
recovery
to
the
policy
and
there
would
be
no
diversity
between
them.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
in
the
federal
court,
sir?
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
in
the
federal
court,
the
provident
tradesmen
bank
and
trust
and
so
forth,
having
been
named
administrator
of
the
estate
of
a
man
named
lynch
who
was
riding
in
the
car
brought
the
declaratory
judgment
action
against
the
estate
of
donald
cionci
who
was
the
driver
and
the
lumbermens
mutual
casualty
company.
later
on,
the
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
they've
brought
this
declaratory
judgment
action
to
declare
the
coverage
of
the
lumbermens'
policy
was
available
to
donald
cionci.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
one
judgment
had
been
obtained
against
cionci
in
the
federal
court
before
this
declaratory
judgment
action
was
brought
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
not
the
judgment
action,
no,
sir.
that
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
--
that's
a
separate
action.
the
action
in
which
the
$50,000
judgment
was
obtained
is
not
touched
by
the
matter
now
before
your
honors.
that
was
an
action
sounding
in
tort
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
they
dismissed
the
declaratory
judgment
action.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
think
the
reasoning
of
the
majority
was
that
in
fact
dutcher
had
a
substantive
right
to
be
a
party
since
he
was
in
the
party
and
said,
his
interest
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
sir?
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
because
he
wasn't
a
party.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
don't
know
whether
anyone
thought
of
doing
that
certainly
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
--
the
minority
didn't
decide
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
if
the
case
is
dismissed
the
advantage
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
the
insurance
carrier.
if
the
case
is
dismissed
the
advantage
the
insurance
carrier
is
that
there
won't
be
contrary
judgments
in
different
jurisdictions
interpreting
the
policy
in
this
particular
case
differently.
if
the
action
that
was
brought
--
the
declaratory
judgment
action
that
was
brought
and
the
result
achieved
in
a
district
court
is
permitted
to
stand
then
in
that
case
it
will
be
said
that
the
lumbermens
has
to
give
coverage
to
cionci.
but
if
an
action
is
brought
in
delaware
county
and
raises
the
coverage
question,
it
can
very
well
be
decided
exactly
the
contrary.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
the
accident
happened
in
1959.
first,
there
were
suits
started
out
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
well,
that's
what
it
was
sir.
it
was
an
automobile
accident
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
don't
think
the
lawyers
did
it
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
think
the
fact
that
there
wasn't
the
--
a
necessary
diversity
in
the
federal
court
action
in
order
to
enable
the
jointer
of
dutcher
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
--
is
what
caused
the
problems.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
in
the
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
in
the
district
court?
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
there
was
the
estate
of
lynch
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
--
and
that's
represented
by
provident
tradesmen.
then
there
was
a
personal
representative
of
another
injured
--
of
a
deceased
party
and
an
injured
party.
those
three
people
were
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
the
defendant
was
the
lumbermens
mutual
casualty
company,
a
corporation
formed
in
illinois
and
having
a
principal
place
of
business
there.
the
estate
of
cionci
which
originally
had
a
pennsylvania
representative
but
then
later
on
got
a
jersey
representative
so
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
against
the
lumbermens?
there
wouldn't
be
--
there
be
diversity
as
to
lumbermens
but
not
as
to
cionci.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
maybe
i
was
--
there
would
have
been
diversity
with
the
out
of
state
administrator
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
--
between
dutcher
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
if
dutcher
were
a
plaintiff,
there
could
have
been.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
--
but
they
never
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
that's
correct.
but
the
difficulty
is
the
--
from
the
standpoint
of
people
who
brought
the
action
was
that
if
they
made
dutcher
a
party,
they
would
have
a
different
situation
with
respect
to
the
interest.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
well,
then
i
would
think
sir
that
the
matter
would
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
but
that
was
never
done
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
think
it
is
properly
before
the
court
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
no,
i
think
then
that
we'd
have
to
try
the
case
on
that
theory.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
oh,
i
think
dutcher
would
then
have
a
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel
so
that
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
sir?
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
well,
and
he
wasn't
represented
by
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
yes.
just
try
the
declaratory
judgment
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
it
didn't
at
the
last
trial
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
sir?
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
well,
that
has
no
bearing
on
the
fact
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
that
dutcher
had
no
counsel
and
was
not
a
party.
i
would
agree
with
your
honor
that
if
he
could
be
joined
as
a
plaintiff
and
given
an
opportunity
to
appear
with
counsel
in
the
case
tried
that
would
probably
be
a
solution.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
wouldn't
think
that
it
really
ordered
the
court
to
do
that,
not
necessarily
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
maybe
that
would
have
been
for
the
district
court
to
do
but
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
can
take
the
action
which
has
already
been
tried
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
the
district
court
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
think
that
could
have
been
done.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
should
think
so
too.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
as
far
as
the
coverage
sir?
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
would
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
would
think
that
it'd
be
in
pennsylvania
20
years.
it's
a
contract
under
seal.
the
question
is
a
contractual
of
question
so
far
as
coverage
is
concerned.
they
could
--
the
rule
in
pennsylvania
is
that
a
contract
under
seal
is
certainly
good
at
least
for
20
years
in
the
statute
of
limitation
within
the
breach
would
be
bad.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
in
the
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
in
the
judgment
--
in
the
declaratory
judgment
action?
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
the
defense
was
that
cionci
did
not
have
permission
to
go
down
to
media
with
dutcher's
automobile.
cionci
having
been
given
permission
to
go
from
brentmore
to
ardmore
which
isn't
really
a
long
walk
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
oh,
no.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
no,
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
no,
sir.
chicago,
illinois.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
illinois.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
well,
for
diversity
purposes.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
it's
illinois,
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
it's
found
in
illinois.
its
and
illinois
--
it's
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
the
principal
place
of
business
is
in
illinois.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
yes.
your
honor,
i
think
it's
referring
to
the
principal
place
of
business
test.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
but
i
say
the
principal
place
of
business
is
illinois.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
judge
whom
sir?
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
he
was
not
on
this
court.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
the
dissent
was
by
a
judge
freedman
and
there
was
concurrence
but
no
opinion
by
judge
ganey.
the
other
five
were
unanimous
in
their
holding
and
the
opinion
was
by
judge
kalodner.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
(inaudible)
pennsylvania.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
the
question
that
was
tried
--
that
was
argued
before
judge
freedman
was
pennsylvania
law
so
far
as
the
evidence
rule
was
concerned
--
the
evidence
rule
involved
and
other
ramifications
of
permission
but
his
decision
is
primarily
on
rule
19.
and
in
addition
to
that,
he
makes
some
comments
about
the
pennsylvania
rule
which
we
don't
agree
with
but
that's
enough
before
you.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
no,
i
think
he
was
really
indicating
that
under
rule
19
it
shouldn't
be
dismissed.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
sir,
in
summary
of
what
was
said
yesterday
and
in
our
brief.
the
suggested
order
of
the
minority
of
the
third
circuit
would
by
the
very
order
suggested
contemplate
additional
litigation.
it
contemplates
litigation
by
the
party
who
was
not
a
--
the
person
who
not
a
party
in
order
to
resolve
his
right.
it
is
quite
possible
that
in
asserting
his
rights,
either
in
a
federal
court
or
in
a
state
court
a
conclusion
directly
contrary
to
the
conclusion
reached
in
the
instant
case
in
the
district
court
could
be
reached.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
then
it
would
have
one
decision
saying
that
there
was
no
coverage
for
cionci.
you
would
have
another
decision
saying
it
was
coverage
for
cionci.
and
these
two
decisions
would
be
in
conflict.
the
order
of
the
court
doesn't
say
what
it
would
do
in
that
situation
where
the
proposed
order
of
the
minority
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
the
impact
on
dutcher
is
that
he
may
be
completely
lost
with
no
coverage
due
to
the
fact
of
the
decision
in
one
of
these
courts.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
yes
sir.
if
dutcher
should
prevail
in
a
coverage
case
in
delaware
county,
under
that,
he
would
be
in
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
that
is
if
he
should
obtain
a
verdict
in
an
action
against
the
lumbermens
and
cionci.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
that
there
was
no
coverage
for
cionci
then,
dutcher
would
be
entitled
to
the
entire
fund
that
he
had
provided
by
purchasing
a
policy.
however,
at
the
same
time,
there
would
be
a
finding
in
the
district
court,
federal
district
court
in
philadelphia
that
cionci
was
entitled
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
--
to
the
coverage
of
the
policy.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
think
also
your
honor
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
think
it's
true
if
you
conclude
that
the
carrier
is
going
to
have
to
suffer
double
liability,
yes.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
oh,
i
think
sir,
even
under
rule
19
as
amended,
consideration
must
be
given
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
somebody
is
going
to
suffer
double
liability
because
of
the
holding
in
the
case
where
a
party
should
--
a
person
should
be
a
party
and
is
not
a
party.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
not
necessarily.
i
would
--
in
reading
the
rule,
i
didn't
get
that
impression
sir
and
in
reading
the
articles
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
don't
think
they
did,
i
don't
think
the
minority
opinion
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
as
far
as
the
judgment
standing,
it
isn't
the
position
of
the
respondent
here
that
the
majority
opinion
necessarily
has
to
prevail.
if
there
is
another
way
in
this
same
action
of
bringing
to
a
conclusion
the
coverage
question
in
a
decision
that's
binding
on
dutcher,
who
is
the
name
ensured
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
that
has
not
been
contended
by
anyone.
the
majority
says
he
is
not
bound
by
it.
the
dissenting
opinion
says
that
dutcher
is
not
bound
by
it
and
dutcher
is
not
a
party.
so
i
don't
think
that
the
court
had
any
jurisdiction
of
him
and
i
don't
think
it
could
be
said
that
because
in
an
action
in
which
he
was
not
a
party,
his
insurance
carrier
lost
a
contract
action
that
he
is
bound
by
that
situation.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
think
it
goes
much
further
than
that
your
honor
and
i
think
my
time
is
running
out.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
think
that
the
overall
importance
of
this
case
is
not
this
one
decision
but
the
fact
that
the
federal
declaratory
judgment
act
has
been
a
great
help
in
solving
problems
and
in
cutting
down
litigation.
and
in
the
insurance
field
of
making
it
unnecessary
to
go
through
the
extensive
trial
of
tort
action
because
frequently
when
a
decision
has
arrived
at
on
the
coverage,
then
settlements
are
worked
out.
the
federal
declaratory
judgment
act
is
often
available
when
no
state
act
is
available.
if
a
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
if
he
has
joined
as
a
defendant,
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
diversity
if
he
were
made
a
defendant
if
he
were
in
the
case
as
a
plaintiff.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
well,
we
were
in
no
way
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
--
connected
with
the
case
then,
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
lumbermens
lost?
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
no
sir
because
we
never
did
raise
the
point.
the
point
was
raised
by
the
court
of
appeals
sua
sponte.
we
felt
we
are
perfectly
right
on
the
pennsylvania
law
and
had
every
right
to
reverse
the
district
court.
we
did
not
raise
the
indispensable
party.
that
was
raised
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
that
might
be
so
except
that
dutcher
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
i
don't
know
the
rationale
that
was
followed
in
not
joining
dutcher.
if
we
had
been
involved
in
the
case
at
that
stage,
i
doubt
that
i
would
have
joined
dutcher
because
i
don't
think
an
insurance
company
having
a
fiduciary
relationship
to
its
insured
has
any
right
to
bring
its
insured
into
litigation
that
will
bind
him.
if
other
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
--
party
would
want
to
bind
him
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
my
position
is
not
that
he
should
be
joined.
my
position
is
that
if
he
joined
as
was
suggested
from
the
bench
yesterday
by
the
court,
then
the
lumbermens
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
and
dutcher
will
be
represented
in
the
action
in
the
lower
court.
there
is
no
controversy
at
this
time
between
dutcher,
the
name
insured
and
his
insurance
carrier,
the
lumbermens,
no
controversy
exists
there.
now
i
would
like
to
say,
if
i
may
sir
this
final
word
that
if
any
stamp
of
approval
of
this
court
is
placed
on
this
limited
sort
of
piecemeal
handling
of
this
coverage
problem,
without
overstating
it,
it's
going
to
have
a
nationwide
effect,
because
throughout
the
country,
these
suits
are
started
all
the
time
to
decide
coverage
problems.
and
if
they
can
be
started
and
the
person
that
is
important
to
a
litigation
as
dutcher
can't
be
joined
and
it's
going
to
be
a
piecemeal
decision
of
the
coverage
question
which
will
encourage
more
litigation
of
the
same
question,
then
the
efficacy
of
the
declaratory
judgment
action
is
going
to
be
lost
on
a
50-state
basis.
i
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
but
if
your
honor
please,
it
seems
to
me,
in
reading
the
articles
that
probably
prompted
this
new
rule
19
that
they
contemplate,
and
then
to
the
litigation
which
is
somewhat
synonymous
with
the
contemplation
of
declaratory
judgment
act
that
it
should
be
final
and
decisive
and
not
a
piecemeal
situation
after
the
declaratory
judgment
action
is
over.
and
i
suggest
to
you
your
honor
that
the
answer
is
not
to
have
people
such
as
the
lumbermens
who
have
no
controversy
with
another
person
such
as
this
named
insured
at
its
parallel
to
drag
that
person
into
litigation
and
force
him
to
engage
counsel
by
the
action
of
the
insurance
carrier
which
is
suppose
to
protect
that
name.
i
think
it's
the
obligation
of
the
person
bringing
this
action
to
bring
it
properly.
another
point
sir
that
is
stressed
in
all
the
cases
--
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
but
sir,
i
only
can
say,
to
--
with
regards
to
that
that
dutcher
is
an
innocent
party,
he
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
he
became
a
party
or
not.
and
he's
certainly
going
to
be
put
because
of
litigation
personally,
if
there
is
an
order
such
as
suggested
by
the
minority
of
the
third
circuit.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i'm
not
reading
that
into
the
minority
opinion
and
minority
opinion
specifically
contemplates
dutcher's
starting
further
litigation.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
that
was
in
the
federal
court,
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
it
was
tried
at
the
same
time.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
he
did
testify,
sir.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
yes,
he
was
called
by
counsel
in
representing
the
carrier.
mr.
norman
paul
harvey
that's
correct
your
honor.
