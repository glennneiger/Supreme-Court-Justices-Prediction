no,
supposing
justice
marshall's
questions
to
you,
the
only
person
here
that
may
be
hurt
by
the
failure
to
join
dutcher
as
i
understand
it
is
lumbermens,
the
insurer.
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
now
just
a
moment,
just
a
moment
--
justice
abe
fortas
if
that
is
so,
assume
for
the
moment
that
that
is
so
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
lumbermens
have
no
time
to
move
to
make
dutcher
a
party.
and
my
basic
problem
that
i
have
with
this
case
is
why
court
of
appeals'
sua
sponte
injected
itself
here
in
the
absence
of
a
motion
on
your
part.
if
anybody
is
hurt
by
this,
it's
lumbermens.
i
don't
see
that
dutcher
is
hurt.
anybody
is
hurt
by
--
or
if
he
is
hurt,
he
could
have
come
in.
but
nobody
made
a
motion
to
join
dutcher
on
a
belated
stage
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
raised
this
on
its
own
motion
and
when
you
match
that
against
the
language
of
the
rule,
there's
a
lot
of
difficulty
with
the
--
reversing
the
decision
of
the
district
court
here
on
this
ground.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
suppose
that
what
you're
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
your
position
right
now
is
in
effect
that
he
should
be
joined
with
some
of
the
--
fiduciary
relationship
here,
it's
just
a
belated
assertion
of
a
position
that
has
a
bearing
on
that.
justice
abe
fortas
well
may
i
ask
you,
if
you
don't
mind,
this
is
one
question,
i
am
--
a
fairly
question.
i
wonder
if
that
is
so
indispensable
party
doctrine
may
be
--
if
it
still
exist,
may
be
viewed
one
that
has
life
and
a
momentum
of
its
own.
on
the
other
hand
it
maybe
viewed
as
one
that
has
invoked
only
in
the
interests
of
some
party
to
the
litigation.
and
in
that
event,
it's
at
least
arguable
and
it's
the
medium,
that
party
to
invoke
it
at
an
appropriate
stage,
i
mean
at
the
trial
stage
and
not
the
--
unless
it's
not
available
unless
it
is
invoked
at
that
time,
i
suggest
that
is
a
possible
alternative
to
your
last
statement.
justice
abe
fortas
my
question
is
whether
it's
your
obligation
--
it
was
your
obligation
to
have
objected
seasonably.
that's
the
question
that
i'm
raising.
i
agree
with
you
that
it
is
the
obligation
of
the
claimant
to
join
the
necessary
parties.
but
the
question
is
whether
this
particular
objection
in
the
circumstances
can
be
--
can
prevail
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
was
raised
at
the
trial.
