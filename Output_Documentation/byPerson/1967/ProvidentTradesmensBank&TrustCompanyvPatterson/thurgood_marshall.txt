worries
me,
in
the

action,
if
lumbermens
had
moved
to
join
dutcher
as
an
indispensable
party
and
dutcher
was
joined
as
a
party
defendant,
diversity
is
drawn
and
out
goes
the
lawsuit,
is
that
right?
justice

why
didn't
lumbermens
moved
to
join
it
as

in

justice
thurgood

would
it
be
fair
that
what

if
the

they
raised

is
it
alright?
