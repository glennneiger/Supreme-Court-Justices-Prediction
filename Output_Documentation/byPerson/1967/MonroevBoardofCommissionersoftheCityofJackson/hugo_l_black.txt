but
could
you
tell
me
in
as
brief
statement
as
possible,
what
you
understand
they
want
you
to
do
and
what
you
say
you
are
doing,
what
is
the
difference
between
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
want
you
to
compel
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
student,
colored
students
to
go
into
the
white
schools
enough
to
bring
about
a
better
showing
of
integration,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
what
is
your
position.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
far
is
it
from
over
here
that
you
put
your
hand
some
time
ago
by
where
they
are
or
to
the
school
that's
all
white.
how
far
is
it?
what's
the
distance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
they
would
have
to
walk
or
go
on
a
bus.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you'd
have
to
do
then
would
depend
on
in
walking
like
our
fathers
did,
the
city
buying
in
a
bus.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
your
position
from
directive
and
i
want
to
see
if
it's
right.
you
take
the
position
that
you
now
have
provided
for
anyone
who
wants
to
go
to
any
school
he
pleases.
that's
number
one.
do
you
consider
that
to
be
giving
them
a
right
to
exercise
a
voluntary
choice
and
you
consider
that
if
you
pass
alone
which
--
ask
these
people
who
want
to
stay
at
that
school
or
to
go
to
the
other,
that
would
be
either
the
city
or
the
state
compelling
people
to
go
to
a
school
that
they
don't
want
to
go
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
the
position
you
take
as
a
whole.
that's
the
argument
between
you
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
it
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
intended
to
ask
you
was
if
your
view
based
on
the
fact,
you
would
not
make
any
child
in
the
community
of
a
certain
age
or
his
parents
agree
to
send
him
to
a
school
which
they
objected
to
sending
him
to
that
on
the
contrary,
you
take
the
position
and
you're
allowed
to
take
the
position
that
you
are
not
going
to
compel
anybody
to
go
to
the
school
they
don't
want
to
go
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
basis
you
--
on
any
basis,
what
you're
saying
is
that
you're
not
going
to
compel
him
to
do.
justice
hugo
l.

well,
that's
on
that
side.
what
about
the
other
side?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
your
position,
one
is
white
and
one
is
colored.
what
about
the
colored,
are
you
taking
in
position
and
that
would
compel
them
to
go
to
the
school
they
don't
want
to
go
to.
and
would
place
the
state
in
the
attitude
of
knowing
better
than
they
do,
what
school
they
ought
to
go
to.
