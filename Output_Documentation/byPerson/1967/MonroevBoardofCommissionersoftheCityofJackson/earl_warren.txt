you

chief

mr.
rice.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
diagram
i
mean.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
a
miniature
of
that
in
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
in
the
appendix.
could
you
--
before
you
go
farther
with
your
argument,
would
you
mind
telling
us
what
the
breakdown
is
in
each
of
these
three
schools
as
to
negroes
and
whites.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
attend
the
schools,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
one
is
that?
could
you
point
it
out
to
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
first,
i
thought
we
would
go
to
those
three
that
represented
by
those
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
why
would
that
be
that
they
are
all
negroes
there
and
no
whites?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
could
it
be
also
those
various
lines
that
you
should
draw
there,
the
red
lines
that
appear
on
your
map?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
they
have
anything
to
do
with
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
were
they
drawn
in
that
irregular
line
and
going
clear
across
the
setting.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
did
you
start
coming
along
as
you
mentioned
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
--
was
there
any
reason
why
that
red
line
to
the
left
on
your
--
to
my
left
--
should
outline
an
area
of
the
city
which
is
almost
entirely
white.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
any
reason
why
you
couldn't
have
divided
the
city
a
little
differently
so
it
wouldn't
find
all
the
negroes
or
mostly
negroes
in
one
district
and
most
of
the
whites
in
another.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
why
did
they
do
that
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
just
happenstance
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
under
your
arrangement,
the
negroes
who
live
over
here
on
the
right
side
of
your
map
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
have
to
either
walk
or
have
their
own
automobiles
or
go
on
buses
to
attend
the
school
way
over
on
the
left
part
of
your
map.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
there
are
no
natural
boundaries.
no
natural
routes
that
would
take
them
up
there
to
that
school
either
because
you
say
that's
the
reason
you
drew
your
lines
differently.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
we'll
recess
now
mr.
rice.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
those
the
petitioner's
exhibits?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
the
defense
below,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
the
fairness
or
otherwise
the
transfer
system
as
you
use
it
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
is
there
anything
to
indicate
whether
it
has
function
equitably
in
the
past?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
put
it
this
way.
is
there
anything
in
the
court's
opinion
below
to
indicate
whether
this
was
an
attempt
to
do
the
equitable
thing
or
whether
there
was
discrimination
on
the
parts
of
the
board?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
not
talking
about
bad
faith.
you
can't
approve
bad
faith.
what
did
they
--
what
did
they
determine
about
discriminatory
effects
of
what
you've
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
they
were
acting
discriminatorily.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
ever
been
one
since
that
time
asked
for
a
transfer
to
the
school
or
here
on
the
left,
the
one
where
it's
all
white?
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
been
allowed
to
go.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
buses
that
go
directly
from
this
school
on
the
right
over
to
the
school
on
the
left?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--which
is
all
negro
and
the
one
which
is
white
with
the
exception
of
seven.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
would
they
have
to
go?
can
you
divide
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
bus
fare
from
this
school
on
the
right
to
the
school
on
the
left?
chief
justice
earl
warren
each
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rice,
is
there
any
real
difference
in
principle,
we
claim
your
program
here
and
the
statute
of
california
that
was
recently
before
this
court
which
said
that
anyone
could
sell
or
lease
his
real
estate
to
anyone
that
he
wanted
and
could
not
be
compelled
to
--
sold
to
anyone
else
regardless
of
price.
we
struck
that
down,
i
wonder
if
there
is
any
difference
in
principle
between
that
statute
and
this
one
which
you
have
here?
