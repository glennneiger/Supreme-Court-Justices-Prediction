mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
which
affirmed
an
order
entered
by
the
district
court
in
the
western
district
of
tennessee,
approving
a
desegregation
plan
proposed
by
the
school
authorities
in
jackson,
tennessee.
at
the
outset
before
i
begin
a
description
of
the
facts
and
proceedings,
let
me
attempt
to
state
the
issue
as
i
see
it
here.
the
question
i
think
is
whether
a
school
board
which
has
maintained
a
dual
segregated
system
satisfies
its
obligations
under
the
equal
protection
clause
simply
by
seizing
its
illegal
practices.
its
practices
of
assigning
pupils
on
the
basis
of
race
of
whether
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
should
require
such
boards
to
begin
affirmative
steps
to
thoroughly
dismantle
the
dual
segregated
system
and
bring
about
a
system
which
is
no
longer
segregated.
now
the
courts
below
have
agreed
with
the
school
board’s
argument
which
is
that
their
only
obligations
is
to
stop
using
race
to
assign
pupils
to
declare
neutrality
and
that
so
long
as
they
don’t
use
race
anymore,
it
doesn’t
matter
what
happens,
it
doesn’t
matter
if
they
argue
that
the
school
there
may
be
largely
segregated
as
they
were
before.
the
petitioner's
view
in
our
basic
submission
today,
is
that
it
is
not
enough
merely
for
the
boards
to
stop
their
illegal
and
unconstitutional
practices
but
that
in
addition,
the
school
authorities
have
to
take
steps
designed
to
actually
reform
the
dual
system
of
schools
which
they
have
built
up
to
integrate
them
if
you
will.
in
other
words,
we
urge
that
the
remedy
must
be
designed
to
purely
evil
and
that
the
evil
was
the
racially
segregated
school
system
that
the
authorities
have
put
together.
this
is
a
very
basic
and
fundamental
question
i
think
about
the
meaning
of
the
brown
decision
because
the
court
is
familiar
with
the
war
that's
been
going
on.
a
war
that
many
public
officials
have
been
waging
against
the
brown
decision
for
all
these
years
and
i
think
the
school
boards
and
these
cases
are
still
fighting
that
war.
they
have
sophisticated
arguments
but
they
are
indeed
fighting
to
keep
just
as
much
segregation
in
these
school
systems
as
the
courts
will
let
them
keep.
that's
what's
involved
here
and
that's
the
issue.
will
we
have
real
reform
of
the
segregated
school
systems
or
will
the
courts
be
content
with
nominal
and
token
compliance.
united
states
civil
rights
commission
examined
a
situation
filed
and
made
a
report
to
the
congress
and
the
president
last
july
and
it
pointed
out
that
in
many
areas
there
has
been
commendable
progress
but
that
nevertheless,
vast
majority
of
negro
children
are
still
denied
the
rights,
their
rights
under
the
decision
in
the
school
segregation
cases.
the
commission
said
its
conclusion,
if
these
rights
are
to
be
secured,
this
cannot
be
a
time
for
retrenchment
or
wavering
of
purpose
and
this
is
our
view
too.
now,
i
think
it
is
helpful
to
look
a
bit
at
the
particular
facts
of
the
jackson,
tennessee
school
system.
jackson
has
13
schools,
a
little
more
than
7600
pupils,
about
60%
of
them
are
white
and
about
40%
negro.
when
petitioners
filed
this
lawsuit
in
january
1963,
there
were
--
there
was
still
complete
segregation
of
faculty
and
pupils
except
for
seven
negroes
where
they
admitted
in
white
schools.
there
were
eight
white
schools
and
five
negro
schools
and
today,
after
five
years
of
litigation,
we
still
have
the
five
all
negro
schools
attended
by
80%
of
the
negro
pupils
in
the
county,
a
little
more
than
80%.
now
in
august
1963
when
the
district
court
first
approved
a
desegregation
plan
for
jackson,
tennessee,
it
approved
the
plan
calling
for
gradual
desegregation
in
five
annual
steps
of
various
grade
levels.
and
the
plan
proposed
by
the
school
board
provided
for
school
zones,
provided
that
each
school
building
would
have
a
geographic
attendance
area
around
it
but
--
and
they
also
made
provisions
for
pupils
to
transfer
out
of
the
areas
where
they
lived
and
the
plan
that
the
judge
approved
was
that
any
transfer
arrangements
that
the
school
board
wanted
to
make
would
be
acceptable
provided
the
court
said
they
were
reasonable
and
were
not
based
on
race.
now,
after
in
the
fall
of
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
well,
it
didn't
work
out
that
way.
i
think
that's
what
the
district
judge
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
well,
it's
not
now
but
it
was
--
i
was
telling
the
events
chronologically.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
now,
we
have
free
choice
just
like
new
kent.
we
have
free
transfer
out
of
the
zones
at
that
time
and
in
the
fall
of
1964,
27
negro
pupils
after
the
plan
had
been
operated
for
two
long
years,
these
27
negro
pupils
intervene
in
the
case,
complaining
that
they
have
been
denied
admission
to
white
schools
discriminatorily.
they
also
complained
that
the
school
zones
were
gerrymandered
and
they
asked
for
faculty
desegregation.
the
district
court
held
the
hearing.
it
took
evidence
and
lasting
several
days
to
file
an
issue
and
opinion
of
an
order
in
the
summer
of
1965
and
that's
what
this
comes
from.
and
in
that
opinion,
the
district
judge
held
that
indeed
the
school
board
was
disobeying
his
prior
order
that
they
were
discriminating
in
the
transfers.
he
thought
that
the
disobedience
of
his
order
was
so
egregious
that
he
ordered
counsel
fees
on
that
issue.
what
the
school
board
was
doing
according
to
his
finding
was
that
any
white
child
who
lived
in
a
negro
zone
was
permitted
to
transfer
to
go
to
a
white
school
and
100%
of
the
white
children
did
just
that
during
those
three
years.
every
white
child
who
was
zoned
into
the
negro
areas
still
went
to
the
white
school
but
the
negro
children
in
those
same
neighborhoods
were
required
by
the
school
board
to
stay
in
negro
school
and
this
was
two
years
after
this
court
condemned
such
an
arrangement
in
goss
case.
the
jackson,
tennessee
school
board
was
still
there.
the
district
judge
also
ruled
that
the
school
zones
for
the
elementary
schools,
eight
elementary
schools,
five
white
and
three
negroes
were
gerrymandered
racial
and
that
finding
by
the
district
judge
was
followed
elaborate
presentation
of
evidence,
with
diagrams
and
maps
and
expert
testimony
by
school
educators
and
the
district
judge
found
that
the
elementary
zones
were
gerrymandered.
now,
the
court
rejected
the
plaintiff's
argument
about
gerrymandering
of
the
junior
high
school
zone.
i'm
going
to
--
i
think
the
trial
judge
made
plain
in
his
opinion
however
that
the
basic
position
which
guided
his
decision
of
these
gerrymandering
issues
and
the
zoning
issues
was
a
view
of
a
law
that
he
thought
primarily
a
legal
question
was
involved
and
this
is
as
to
what
sort
of
a
standard
he
should
use
in
looking
at
the
evidence.
now
petitioners
had
two
school
administrators,
two
school
superintendents
as
expert
witnesses
to
make
a
study
of
the
zone
lines
and
the
attendance
pattern.
and
they
prepared
a
number
of
exhibits
which
we
were
not
able
to
print
but
we
have
reproduced
one
of
them.
it's
the
exhibit
in
the
blue
folder.
we
reproduced
photographically
a
copy
of
i
think
the
most
important
exhibit
and
what
--
the
exhibit
you
have
in
the
blue
folder
is
the
small
copy
of
the
exhibit
i
have
on
the
aisle,
the
one
on
the
aisle
is
just
an
enlargement
of
the
little
one.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
yes,
i
think
the
simplest
way
to
begin
is
to
start
with
the
basic
map
of
the
(inaudible)
layers
–
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
that's
correct.
now,
if
you
--
the
underlying
map
shows
the
city
of
jackson
and
if
you
spread
the
red
dots
over,
the
city
that
white
--
these
dots
represent
the
white
junior
high
school
children
in
the
city
and
what
the
picture
shows
that
they're
spread
all
over
the
city
generally.
they're
distributed
throughout
jackson.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
the
whites.
if
you
remove
that
for
a
moment
and
spread
the
blue
dots
over,
you
can
see
that
the
negroes
in
jackson,
tennessee
are
distributed
more
or
less
in
the
center
of
the
city.
now,
with
--
starting
with
that
situation,
the
school
board
built
three
junior
high
schools,
all
sets
the
brown
decision.
they
built
one
junior
high
school
in
the
western
part
of
the
city.
they
built
one
in
the
east
and
they
built
one
in
the
center
and
they
adopted
and
those
three
schools
opened
as
two
all
white
schools
and
one
all
negro
schools
and
they
were
establishments
and
such
with
all
negro
faculties
in
the
merry
junior
high
school
in
the
side
of
the
negro
school
and
the
other
two
schools
were
established
as
all
white
schools.
in
1965
when
the
board
was
ordered
to
desegregate
junior
high
schools,
it
proposed
these
school
zones
indicated
by
the
green
lines
so
that's
the
green
lines
over
the
blue
dots
for
a
moment.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
that's
right,
that's
right.
but
in
1965,
they
began
to
desegregate.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
ten
years
after
the
(inaudible).
this
is
when
the
plans
reached
the
junior
high
school.
so
what
we
have
is
this
hourglass
shape
zone
as
the
witnesses
called
it
in
the
middle
which
was
the
attendance
area
for
merry
junior
high
school,
a
negro
school.
and
as
you
can
see
it
included
most
but
not
all
the
negroes
in
the
city.
if
you
remove
the
--
put
the
red
dots
on
again
and
spread
the
zones
over
there,
you
can
see
that
there
are
a
handful
of
white
pupils
in
merry
junior
high
school
zone.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
no.
none
have
ever
gone.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
they
transfer
out
--
or
jackson
and
merry
discontinued
a
100%
negro
school.
now
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
jackson
is
desegregated
but
all
of
the
roman
figures
for
the
current
year
are
page
3
of
the
school
board's
brief.
jackson
have--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
130.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
i
have
a
total
of
135
negroes
in
jackson.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
i
think--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
i'm
taking
a
moment
to
calculate
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
those
dots
stand
for
five
pupils
each.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
180.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
we
don't
have
a
breakdown
for
the
current
year
beyond
that
on
page
3
of
the
school
board's
brief.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
now,
the
plaintiff's
expert
witness
proposed
a
--
testified
that
he
thought
it
was
quite
claimed
with
this
arrangement
that
merely
it
has
got
to
remain
an
all
negro
school.
the
experience
two
years
prior
to
the
plan
had
been
in
the
elementary
grade.
every
white
child
in
the
negro
zone
transferred
out.
and
there
were
so
few
whites
in
the
merry
zone
and
there
were
so
many
negroes
concentrated
there.
it
was
just
apparent
that
merry
was
going
to
remain
an
all
negro
school.
so
the
plaintiff's
expert
proposed
an
alternate
--
in
his
testimony,
mr.
herman
proposed
an
ultimate
arrangement,
plant
to
desegregate
all
three
schools
and
it
was
very
simple.
he
proposed
that
the
white
elementary
up
in
this
area
called
highland
park,
and
the
east
jackson
school
and
the
negro
school
down
this
area
flee
their
pupils
to
tigrett,
that
the
white
pupils
in
elementary
graduate
--
finished
elementary
school
here,
the
negro
people
at
the
school
here
send
their
children
to
merry
and
that
the
pupils
of
the
two
white
schools
in
the
eastern
section
and
the
negro
school
down
here
in
washington
douglas
send
their
pupils
to
jackson.
he
said
that
the
capacity
is
all
fit
that
this
method
would
be
in
accordance
with
the
traditional
way
of
assigning
pupils
in
schools
all
over
the
country
of
signing
the
graduates
of
an
elementary
school
to
be
gathered
to
a
junior
high
school.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
that's
right.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
that's
right.
and
you
would
have
assigned
pupils
so
that
all
three
junior
high
schools
would
have
been
desegregated.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
yes,
in
other
words,
we
would
have
taken
the
elementary
school
zone
lines
and
drawn
another
map
and
clustered
them,
combined
three
of
them
and
made
them
as
zones
for
the
--
made
up
the
zones
of
junior
high
school.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
there
were
two
people
yes.
one
was
a
school
superintendent
and
the
other
was
an
assistant
school
superintendent.
they
both
made
a
study
and
they
prepared
these
exhibits.
they
made
a
study
of
all
the
school
zones.
they
were
from
two
different
school
systems
in
illinois
and
they
conducted
a
fairly
substantial
study
of
the
jackson
system
and
they
made
this
recommendation.
the
trial
judge
rejected
it
because
he
said
these
witnesses
assume
that
there
was
a
duty
to
integrate
the
schools
and
to
maximize
integration,
and
that
was
not
his
understanding
of
the
law
so
he
disregarded
their
recommendation.
because
apparently
the
trial
judge
thought
that
his
search
was
to
find
out
whether
there
was
a
non-racial
explanation
for
the
plan.
other
than
that,
there
was
a
nonracial
explanation
to
find
out
and
explain
why
the
plan
retained
a
large
degree
of
segregation.
it's
our
view
of
course
that
that's
the
wrong
inquiry.
the
proper
inquiry
for
the
trial
court
should
be
to
find
out
if
there
is
any
reasonable
way
of
reforming
the
system,
any
reasonable
way
of
integrating
the
school.
if
the
court
had
understood
the
issue
that
way,
it
would
have
reached
a
different
result.
we
think
that
there
must
be
a
duty
to
disestablish
segregation
because
this
is
the
only
way
to
assure
that
the
effects
of
the
unconstitutional
practices
are
really
disobeyed
and
are
not
--
and
that
segregation
is
not
just
been
carried
on
under
no
judge.
it's
the
only
way
the
community
can
be
disabused
of
the
idea
that
schools
are
still
segregated
just
as
they
always
were.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
well,
i
think
i
would
make
an
argument
in
other
areas
that's
consistent
with
that
one
but
the
argument
i
make
is
addressed
to
such
a
community
and
its
particular
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
yes,
yes.
that's
the
--
i
think
looking
at
it
as
an
issue
of
remedy
is
very
illuminating.
it's
very
analogous
i
think
to
cases
like
this
courts
had
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
where
you
had
company
dominated
unions.
and
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
it's
simply
enough
to
order
them
to
stop
the
illegal
domination
of
whether
you
must
require
to
establish
and
of
course,
we
would
follow
that
analogy
out
as
this
court
has
done.
obviously,
what
has
to
be
done
is
to
strike
a
way,
to
wipe
the
slate
clean.
you
can't
wipe
the
slate
clean.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
yes,
yes.
this
is
the
only
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
the
policy
of
neutrality
is
not
good
enough
to
undo
what
they've
done
in
the
community
like
this
after
all,
the
tennessee
had
--
tennessee
school
segregation
law
--
as
i
think
about
them
are
really
significant.
they
were
criminal
statutes.
in
tennessee
it
was
a
crime.
six
months
in
jail
for
running
an
integrated
school.
a
policy
like
that
is
significant
to
the
public.
it
can't
be
uprooted
by
a
hands-off
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
no.
i
think
there's
a
class
of
neutrality
about
the
free
choice
idea
but
it's
not
a
neutral
plan
at
all.
i
think
this
is
a
segregationist
plan
because
it
groups
all
the
negroes
together
and
the
trial
judge
found
that
that
was
their
intention
in
the
elementary
school
zone.
he
found
that
they
had
a
segregationist
policy
in
terms
of
--
in
the
way
they
were
administering
the
transfers
until
we
stopped
them.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
oh
yes,
yes.
sure.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
well,
i
think
no.
i
think
that
there's
nothing
you
know
that's
not
neutral
about
the
geographic
zoning
idea.
i
think
this
particular
plan
was
not
well
intended.
that's
all
i
meant
in
that.
in
a
voting
case
that
the
court
considered
several
terms
ago
called
louisiana
against
the
united
states.
mr.
justice
black
wrote
for
the
court
that
the
court
has
not
merely
the
power
but
the
duty
to
render
a
decree
which
will
so
far
as
possible
eliminate
the
discriminatory
effects
of
the
past,
as
well
as
bar
discrimination
in
the
future.
it
seems
to
me,
what
i'm
talking
about
is
eliminating
the
discriminatory
effects
of
the
past
and
that
where
the
school
board
is
engaged
in
vigorous
efforts
to
maintain
segregation
that
they
must
engage
in
equally
vigorous
efforts
to
dismantle
the
dual
system
they
create.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
well,
it
could
be
washington.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
i
see.
but
frederick
douglas.
to
finish,
i
think
to
fully
understand
the
trial
judge's
thinking
and
what
we
regard
as
the
erroneous
standard
influenced
it.
the
trial
judge
looked
at
the
zones
and
he
thought
and
this
is
from
his
opinion.
he
thought
fair
discretion
in
drawing
zone
should
not
be
overwritten
unless
it
constitutes
a
clearer
abuse
of
discretion.
in
other
words,
a
quick
thought,
he
thought
he
was
required
to
approve
any
arrangements
that
the
school
boards
made
as
long
as
they
weren't
obviously
phony
--
obvious
trait
to
preserve
segregation.
whereas,
we
submit
that
the
proper
inquiry
is
for
the
judge
to
look
at
what
is
the
most
reasonable
way
consistent
with
maintaining
an
effective
educational
program.
what's
the
most
reasonable
way
for
dismantling
the
dual
system
and
for
eliminating
segregation
and
that
if
district
judge
has
made
that
inquiry,
we
would
get
a
substantially
different
results
in
these
communities.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
which
affirmed
an
order
entered
by
the
district
court
in
the
western
district
of
tennessee,
approving
a
desegregation
plan
proposed
by
the
school
authorities
in
jackson,
tennessee.
at
the
outset
before
i
begin
a
description
of
the
facts
and
proceedings,
let
me
attempt
to
state
the
issue
as
i
see
it
here.
the
question
i
think
is
whether
a
school
board
which
has
maintained
a
dual
segregated
system
satisfies
its
obligations
under
the
equal
protection
clause
simply
by
seizing
its
illegal
practices.
its
practices
of
assigning
pupils
on
the
basis
of
race
of
whether
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
should
require
such
boards
to
begin
affirmative
steps
to
thoroughly
dismantle
the
dual
segregated
system
and
bring
about
a
system
which
is
no
longer
segregated.
now
the
courts
below
have
agreed
with
the
school
board’s
argument
which
is
that
their
only
obligations
is
to
stop
using
race
to
assign
pupils
to
declare
neutrality
and
that
so
long
as
they
don’t
use
race
anymore,
it
doesn’t
matter
what
happens,
it
doesn’t
matter
if
they
argue
that
the
school
there
may
be
largely
segregated
as
they
were
before.
the
petitioner's
view
in
our
basic
submission
today,
is
that
it
is
not
enough
merely
for
the
boards
to
stop
their
illegal
and
unconstitutional
practices
but
that
in
addition,
the
school
authorities
have
to
take
steps
designed
to
actually
reform
the
dual
system
of
schools
which
they
have
built
up
to
integrate
them
if
you
will.
in
other
words,
we
urge
that
the
remedy
must
be
designed
to
purely
evil
and
that
the
evil
was
the
racially
segregated
school
system
that
the
authorities
have
put
together.
this
is
a
very
basic
and
fundamental
question
i
think
about
the
meaning
of
the
brown
decision
because
the
court
is
familiar
with
the
war
that's
been
going
on.
a
war
that
many
public
officials
have
been
waging
against
the
brown
decision
for
all
these
years
and
i
think
the
school
boards
and
these
cases
are
still
fighting
that
war.
they
have
sophisticated
arguments
but
they
are
indeed
fighting
to
keep
just
as
much
segregation
in
these
school
systems
as
the
courts
will
let
them
keep.
that's
what's
involved
here
and
that's
the
issue.
will
we
have
real
reform
of
the
segregated
school
systems
or
will
the
courts
be
content
with
nominal
and
token
compliance.
united
states
civil
rights
commission
examined
a
situation
filed
and
made
a
report
to
the
congress
and
the
president
last
july
and
it
pointed
out
that
in
many
areas
there
has
been
commendable
progress
but
that
nevertheless,
vast
majority
of
negro
children
are
still
denied
the
rights,
their
rights
under
the
decision
in
the
school
segregation
cases.
the
commission
said
its
conclusion,
if
these
rights
are
to
be
secured,
this
cannot
be
a
time
for
retrenchment
or
wavering
of
purpose
and
this
is
our
view
too.
now,
i
think
it
is
helpful
to
look
a
bit
at
the
particular
facts
of
the
jackson,
tennessee
school
system.
jackson
has
13
schools,
a
little
more
than
7600
pupils,
about
60%
of
them
are
white
and
about
40%
negro.
when
petitioners
filed
this
lawsuit
in
january
1963,
there
were
--
there
was
still
complete
segregation
of
faculty
and
pupils
except
for
seven
negroes
where
they
admitted
in
white
schools.
there
were
eight
white
schools
and
five
negro
schools
and
today,
after
five
years
of
litigation,
we
still
have
the
five
all
negro
schools
attended
by
80%
of
the
negro
pupils
in
the
county,
a
little
more
than
80%.
now
in
august
1963
when
the
district
court
first
approved
a
desegregation
plan
for
jackson,
tennessee,
it
approved
the
plan
calling
for
gradual
desegregation
in
five
annual
steps
of
various
grade
levels.
and
the
plan
proposed
by
the
school
board
provided
for
school
zones,
provided
that
each
school
building
would
have
a
geographic
attendance
area
around
it
but
--
and
they
also
made
provisions
for
pupils
to
transfer
out
of
the
areas
where
they
lived
and
the
plan
that
the
judge
approved
was
that
any
transfer
arrangements
that
the
school
board
wanted
to
make
would
be
acceptable
provided
the
court
said
they
were
reasonable
and
were
not
based
on
race.
now,
after
in
the
fall
of
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
well,
it
didn't
work
out
that
way.
i
think
that's
what
the
district
judge
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
well,
it's
not
now
but
it
was
--
i
was
telling
the
events
chronologically.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
now,
we
have
free
choice
just
like
new
kent.
we
have
free
transfer
out
of
the
zones
at
that
time
and
in
the
fall
of
1964,
27
negro
pupils
after
the
plan
had
been
operated
for
two
long
years,
these
27
negro
pupils
intervene
in
the
case,
complaining
that
they
have
been
denied
admission
to
white
schools
discriminatorily.
they
also
complained
that
the
school
zones
were
gerrymandered
and
they
asked
for
faculty
desegregation.
the
district
court
held
the
hearing.
it
took
evidence
and
lasting
several
days
to
file
an
issue
and
opinion
of
an
order
in
the
summer
of
1965
and
that's
what
this
comes
from.
and
in
that
opinion,
the
district
judge
held
that
indeed
the
school
board
was
disobeying
his
prior
order
that
they
were
discriminating
in
the
transfers.
he
thought
that
the
disobedience
of
his
order
was
so
egregious
that
he
ordered
counsel
fees
on
that
issue.
what
the
school
board
was
doing
according
to
his
finding
was
that
any
white
child
who
lived
in
a
negro
zone
was
permitted
to
transfer
to
go
to
a
white
school
and
100%
of
the
white
children
did
just
that
during
those
three
years.
every
white
child
who
was
zoned
into
the
negro
areas
still
went
to
the
white
school
but
the
negro
children
in
those
same
neighborhoods
were
required
by
the
school
board
to
stay
in
negro
school
and
this
was
two
years
after
this
court
condemned
such
an
arrangement
in
goss
case.
the
jackson,
tennessee
school
board
was
still
there.
the
district
judge
also
ruled
that
the
school
zones
for
the
elementary
schools,
eight
elementary
schools,
five
white
and
three
negroes
were
gerrymandered
racial
and
that
finding
by
the
district
judge
was
followed
elaborate
presentation
of
evidence,
with
diagrams
and
maps
and
expert
testimony
by
school
educators
and
the
district
judge
found
that
the
elementary
zones
were
gerrymandered.
now,
the
court
rejected
the
plaintiff's
argument
about
gerrymandering
of
the
junior
high
school
zone.
i'm
going
to
--
i
think
the
trial
judge
made
plain
in
his
opinion
however
that
the
basic
position
which
guided
his
decision
of
these
gerrymandering
issues
and
the
zoning
issues
was
a
view
of
a
law
that
he
thought
primarily
a
legal
question
was
involved
and
this
is
as
to
what
sort
of
a
standard
he
should
use
in
looking
at
the
evidence.
now
petitioners
had
two
school
administrators,
two
school
superintendents
as
expert
witnesses
to
make
a
study
of
the
zone
lines
and
the
attendance
pattern.
and
they
prepared
a
number
of
exhibits
which
we
were
not
able
to
print
but
we
have
reproduced
one
of
them.
it's
the
exhibit
in
the
blue
folder.
we
reproduced
photographically
a
copy
of
i
think
the
most
important
exhibit
and
what
--
the
exhibit
you
have
in
the
blue
folder
is
the
small
copy
of
the
exhibit
i
have
on
the
aisle,
the
one
on
the
aisle
is
just
an
enlargement
of
the
little
one.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
yes,
i
think
the
simplest
way
to
begin
is
to
start
with
the
basic
map
of
the
(inaudible)
layers
–
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
that's
correct.
now,
if
you
--
the
underlying
map
shows
the
city
of
jackson
and
if
you
spread
the
red
dots
over,
the
city
that
white
--
these
dots
represent
the
white
junior
high
school
children
in
the
city
and
what
the
picture
shows
that
they're
spread
all
over
the
city
generally.
they're
distributed
throughout
jackson.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
the
whites.
if
you
remove
that
for
a
moment
and
spread
the
blue
dots
over,
you
can
see
that
the
negroes
in
jackson,
tennessee
are
distributed
more
or
less
in
the
center
of
the
city.
now,
with
--
starting
with
that
situation,
the
school
board
built
three
junior
high
schools,
all
sets
the
brown
decision.
they
built
one
junior
high
school
in
the
western
part
of
the
city.
they
built
one
in
the
east
and
they
built
one
in
the
center
and
they
adopted
and
those
three
schools
opened
as
two
all
white
schools
and
one
all
negro
schools
and
they
were
establishments
and
such
with
all
negro
faculties
in
the
merry
junior
high
school
in
the
side
of
the
negro
school
and
the
other
two
schools
were
established
as
all
white
schools.
in
1965
when
the
board
was
ordered
to
desegregate
junior
high
schools,
it
proposed
these
school
zones
indicated
by
the
green
lines
so
that's
the
green
lines
over
the
blue
dots
for
a
moment.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
that's
right,
that's
right.
but
in
1965,
they
began
to
desegregate.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
ten
years
after
the
(inaudible).
this
is
when
the
plans
reached
the
junior
high
school.
so
what
we
have
is
this
hourglass
shape
zone
as
the
witnesses
called
it
in
the
middle
which
was
the
attendance
area
for
merry
junior
high
school,
a
negro
school.
and
as
you
can
see
it
included
most
but
not
all
the
negroes
in
the
city.
if
you
remove
the
--
put
the
red
dots
on
again
and
spread
the
zones
over
there,
you
can
see
that
there
are
a
handful
of
white
pupils
in
merry
junior
high
school
zone.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
no.
none
have
ever
gone.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
they
transfer
out
--
or
jackson
and
merry
discontinued
a
100%
negro
school.
now
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
jackson
is
desegregated
but
all
of
the
roman
figures
for
the
current
year
are
page
3
of
the
school
board's
brief.
jackson
have--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
130.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
i
have
a
total
of
135
negroes
in
jackson.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
i
think--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
i'm
taking
a
moment
to
calculate
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
those
dots
stand
for
five
pupils
each.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
180.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
we
don't
have
a
breakdown
for
the
current
year
beyond
that
on
page
3
of
the
school
board's
brief.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
now,
the
plaintiff's
expert
witness
proposed
a
--
testified
that
he
thought
it
was
quite
claimed
with
this
arrangement
that
merely
it
has
got
to
remain
an
all
negro
school.
the
experience
two
years
prior
to
the
plan
had
been
in
the
elementary
grade.
every
white
child
in
the
negro
zone
transferred
out.
and
there
were
so
few
whites
in
the
merry
zone
and
there
were
so
many
negroes
concentrated
there.
it
was
just
apparent
that
merry
was
going
to
remain
an
all
negro
school.
so
the
plaintiff's
expert
proposed
an
alternate
--
in
his
testimony,
mr.
herman
proposed
an
ultimate
arrangement,
plant
to
desegregate
all
three
schools
and
it
was
very
simple.
he
proposed
that
the
white
elementary
up
in
this
area
called
highland
park,
and
the
east
jackson
school
and
the
negro
school
down
this
area
flee
their
pupils
to
tigrett,
that
the
white
pupils
in
elementary
graduate
--
finished
elementary
school
here,
the
negro
people
at
the
school
here
send
their
children
to
merry
and
that
the
pupils
of
the
two
white
schools
in
the
eastern
section
and
the
negro
school
down
here
in
washington
douglas
send
their
pupils
to
jackson.
he
said
that
the
capacity
is
all
fit
that
this
method
would
be
in
accordance
with
the
traditional
way
of
assigning
pupils
in
schools
all
over
the
country
of
signing
the
graduates
of
an
elementary
school
to
be
gathered
to
a
junior
high
school.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
that's
right.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
that's
right.
and
you
would
have
assigned
pupils
so
that
all
three
junior
high
schools
would
have
been
desegregated.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
yes,
in
other
words,
we
would
have
taken
the
elementary
school
zone
lines
and
drawn
another
map
and
clustered
them,
combined
three
of
them
and
made
them
as
zones
for
the
--
made
up
the
zones
of
junior
high
school.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
there
were
two
people
yes.
one
was
a
school
superintendent
and
the
other
was
an
assistant
school
superintendent.
they
both
made
a
study
and
they
prepared
these
exhibits.
they
made
a
study
of
all
the
school
zones.
they
were
from
two
different
school
systems
in
illinois
and
they
conducted
a
fairly
substantial
study
of
the
jackson
system
and
they
made
this
recommendation.
the
trial
judge
rejected
it
because
he
said
these
witnesses
assume
that
there
was
a
duty
to
integrate
the
schools
and
to
maximize
integration,
and
that
was
not
his
understanding
of
the
law
so
he
disregarded
their
recommendation.
because
apparently
the
trial
judge
thought
that
his
search
was
to
find
out
whether
there
was
a
non-racial
explanation
for
the
plan.
other
than
that,
there
was
a
nonracial
explanation
to
find
out
and
explain
why
the
plan
retained
a
large
degree
of
segregation.
it's
our
view
of
course
that
that's
the
wrong
inquiry.
the
proper
inquiry
for
the
trial
court
should
be
to
find
out
if
there
is
any
reasonable
way
of
reforming
the
system,
any
reasonable
way
of
integrating
the
school.
if
the
court
had
understood
the
issue
that
way,
it
would
have
reached
a
different
result.
we
think
that
there
must
be
a
duty
to
disestablish
segregation
because
this
is
the
only
way
to
assure
that
the
effects
of
the
unconstitutional
practices
are
really
disobeyed
and
are
not
--
and
that
segregation
is
not
just
been
carried
on
under
no
judge.
it's
the
only
way
the
community
can
be
disabused
of
the
idea
that
schools
are
still
segregated
just
as
they
always
were.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
well,
i
think
i
would
make
an
argument
in
other
areas
that's
consistent
with
that
one
but
the
argument
i
make
is
addressed
to
such
a
community
and
its
particular
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
yes,
yes.
that's
the
--
i
think
looking
at
it
as
an
issue
of
remedy
is
very
illuminating.
it's
very
analogous
i
think
to
cases
like
this
courts
had
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
where
you
had
company
dominated
unions.
and
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
it's
simply
enough
to
order
them
to
stop
the
illegal
domination
of
whether
you
must
require
to
establish
and
of
course,
we
would
follow
that
analogy
out
as
this
court
has
done.
obviously,
what
has
to
be
done
is
to
strike
a
way,
to
wipe
the
slate
clean.
you
can't
wipe
the
slate
clean.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
yes,
yes.
this
is
the
only
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
the
policy
of
neutrality
is
not
good
enough
to
undo
what
they've
done
in
the
community
like
this
after
all,
the
tennessee
had
--
tennessee
school
segregation
law
--
as
i
think
about
them
are
really
significant.
they
were
criminal
statutes.
in
tennessee
it
was
a
crime.
six
months
in
jail
for
running
an
integrated
school.
a
policy
like
that
is
significant
to
the
public.
it
can't
be
uprooted
by
a
hands-off
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
no.
i
think
there's
a
class
of
neutrality
about
the
free
choice
idea
but
it's
not
a
neutral
plan
at
all.
i
think
this
is
a
segregationist
plan
because
it
groups
all
the
negroes
together
and
the
trial
judge
found
that
that
was
their
intention
in
the
elementary
school
zone.
he
found
that
they
had
a
segregationist
policy
in
terms
of
--
in
the
way
they
were
administering
the
transfers
until
we
stopped
them.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
oh
yes,
yes.
sure.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
well,
i
think
no.
i
think
that
there's
nothing
you
know
that's
not
neutral
about
the
geographic
zoning
idea.
i
think
this
particular
plan
was
not
well
intended.
that's
all
i
meant
in
that.
in
a
voting
case
that
the
court
considered
several
terms
ago
called
louisiana
against
the
united
states.
mr.
justice
black
wrote
for
the
court
that
the
court
has
not
merely
the
power
but
the
duty
to
render
a
decree
which
will
so
far
as
possible
eliminate
the
discriminatory
effects
of
the
past,
as
well
as
bar
discrimination
in
the
future.
it
seems
to
me,
what
i'm
talking
about
is
eliminating
the
discriminatory
effects
of
the
past
and
that
where
the
school
board
is
engaged
in
vigorous
efforts
to
maintain
segregation
that
they
must
engage
in
equally
vigorous
efforts
to
dismantle
the
dual
system
they
create.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
well,
it
could
be
washington.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit
iii
i
see.
but
frederick
douglas.
to
finish,
i
think
to
fully
understand
the
trial
judge's
thinking
and
what
we
regard
as
the
erroneous
standard
influenced
it.
the
trial
judge
looked
at
the
zones
and
he
thought
and
this
is
from
his
opinion.
he
thought
fair
discretion
in
drawing
zone
should
not
be
overwritten
unless
it
constitutes
a
clearer
abuse
of
discretion.
in
other
words,
a
quick
thought,
he
thought
he
was
required
to
approve
any
arrangements
that
the
school
boards
made
as
long
as
they
weren't
obviously
phony
--
obvious
trait
to
preserve
segregation.
whereas,
we
submit
that
the
proper
inquiry
is
for
the
judge
to
look
at
what
is
the
most
reasonable
way
consistent
with
maintaining
an
effective
educational
program.
what's
the
most
reasonable
way
for
dismantling
the
dual
system
and
for
eliminating
segregation
and
that
if
district
judge
has
made
that
inquiry,
we
would
get
a
substantially
different
results
in
these
communities.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
