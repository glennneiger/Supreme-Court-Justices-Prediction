justice
potter
stewart
and
we
have
to
peel
off
three
layers
before
we--
justice
potter
stewart
that
means
to
peel
off
the
top
three
layers
and
we
get
to
the
beginning,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
nabrit,
that
all
of
these
schools
have
been
built
since
1955?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
do
they
go
to
that
high
school?
justice
potter
stewart
they
transfer
out
to
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
of
the
negro--
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
of
the
negroes
who
live
in
jackson
go
to
the
jackson
school?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
negro
children
are
there
in
the
district?
justice
potter
stewart
these
dots
stands
for
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
looks
to
be
180
then.
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
be.
if
each
dot
is
five.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
gather
this
eliminated
any
freedom
of
choice.
justice
potter
stewart
you
had
to
go
to
the
school
in
the
district
in
which
you
lived.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
this
had
been
done
by
drawing
district
clients
i
gathered
to
accomplish
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
--
you
said
this
man
was
an
expert
witness.
what
was
his
area
of
expertise?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
was
that
because
you
say
inherently
it's
impossible
against
this
background
that
it
could
be
neutral?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
--
you
say
it
shows
who
went
to
the
various
schools.
now,
i'm
referring
now
to
this
exhibit.
justice
potter
stewart
this
then
seems
to
show
that
at
least
some
negro
children
went
to
tigrett
junior
high
because
there
are
some
blue
dots
inside
that
to
the
left
of
that
green
line
and
yet
in
your
brief,
it's
indicated
that
no
negro
children
go
to
that
junior
high
school.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
not
maybe
--
justice
potter
stewart
seven,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
would
indicate
that
each
one
of
this
dots
represents
five
children
as
i
understood
it
there
are
some
70
or
so
children
represented
by
those
blue
dots,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
more
or
like
50
perhaps.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
use
bifocal,
i
can
see
--[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
just
doesn't
do
a
whole
lot
to
refer
to
the
map
to
those
dots.
we
can't
see
them.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
rice,
what
was
the
--
in
relation
to
what
lines
was
it
that
the
district
court
found
gerrymandering
as
to
the
elementary
schools.
are
they
there?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
not
too
easily
but
i
can
see
something
that
looks
like
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
did
he
ever
deal
with
an
issue
of
gerrymandering
on
this
junior
high
school
line.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
--
in
any
event
as
long
as
you
have
a
free
transfer
plan
and
one
can
go
out
anywhere
he
pleases
what
significance
do
these
lines
have
anyway?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
rice,
may
i
ask
if
you
did
not
have
the
free
transfer
privilege.
justice
potter
stewart
and
all
of
the
junior
high
school
children
living
in
a
particular
distance
have
to
attend
the
junior
high
school
in
his
or
her
district.
justice
potter
stewart
what
would
be
the
racial
mix
in
those
three
schools?
justice
potter
stewart
i
appreciate
that.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
think
you
said
earlier
the
thing
that
you
apprehended
if
that
kind
of
plan
were
adopted,
is
that
those
living
in
the
district
as
of
washington
douglas
in
that
middle
district.
justice
potter
stewart
yes
that
those
living
in
that
district,
the
whites
would
move
out
rather
than
have
their
children
go
to
that
school.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
rice,
this
is
a
fair
question.
if
this
one
all
white
community,
this
one
all
white
community,
you
suppose
you'd
have
a
free
transfer
plan?
justice
potter
stewart
well
for
example,
i'm
sure
with
your
obvious
familiarity
with
this
whole
problem
in
other
places
where
they
have
all
white
communities
are
free
transfer
plans
very
common?
indeed,
do
we
find
them
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
always
a
transfer
in
so
called
hardship
cases
and
things
like
that.
and
i
wonder
if
you
ever
--
if
it's
a
common
experience
to
have
a
free
transfer
plan
where
the
child
has
for
whatever
reason
his
parents
think
a
good
one,
the
absolute
right
as
under
this
plan
i
understand
of
a
child
to
transfer
to
any
school
he
wants.
justice
potter
stewart
and
we
have
to
peel

out
to
the

justice
potter
stewart
how
many
of
the
negro--
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
of
the
negroes
who
live
in
jackson
go
to
the
jackson
school?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
--
justice

how
many
negro
children
are
there
in
the
district?
