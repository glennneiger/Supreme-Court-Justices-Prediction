white
and
that
means
that
it
was
a
free
transfer
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
mean
--
is
that
any
different
from
the
kent
county
type
of
plans?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
negroes
in
the
jackson
school
district.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
alright.
i
just
wondered
how
many
to
what
extent
the
negroes
have
operated
into
the
free
choice
plan
either
to
go
to
a
white
school
or
to
a
negro
school.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
apparently
your
principle
then
that
you're
urging
would
be
limited
to
those
areas
where
there
had
been
legal
segregation?
justice
byron
r.
white
an
issue
of
remedy.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
there
has
been
official
segregation
should
be
followed
by
some
official
integration.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
your
submission.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think
this
is
a
plan
there
that
you
think
is
a
neutral
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
are
you
urging
this
case
here
on
the
basis
that
this
is
really
a
--
this
zoning,
the
junior
high
schools
really,
actually
in
reality
is
the
initial
segregation?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
rice,
it
may
interest
you
to
know
that
at
least
on
this
end
of
the
bench
you
--
i
just
can't
see
any
dots
on
your
end.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
nothing
to
do
with
bifocal
it's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
we
can't
see
a
dot
up
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
a
miniature
form?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
natural
boundaries
got
to
do
with
educational
considerations?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
one
boundary
seem
to
follow
a
freeway?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
about
to
the
--
under
the
north.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
why
does
it
--
there
are
other
major
roads
around
that
they
could
have
--
why
is
that
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
gather
then
that
your
submission
is
much
as
in
the
previous
case
as
long
as
you
have
a
free
transfer
and
free
choice
of
schools
that
you
can't
be
violating
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
it
--
suppose
with
the
free
choice
provision
do
you
suppose
in
jackson
that
was
predictable
that
there
would
be
this
pattern
of
the
school
attendance.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
event,
it's
a
plan
which
permits
the
community
attitudes
to
be
reflected
in
the
school
attendance
and
you
say
that
is
precisely
what
it
does
and
that
does
not
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
i
mean
because
the
city
is
in
community,
it
reflects
the
attitudes
of
parents
and
school
children.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
had
the
benefit
of
goss
and
goss
said
no
official
transfer
plan
of
which
racial
segregation
is
the
inevitable
consequence
may
stand
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
would
apply
to
the
one
that's
so
called
unrestrictive
transfer
plans
as
well
as
any
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
non-inevitable
is
it
in
jackson.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
they
officially
registered
in
the
school
of
their
district
don't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
must
do
that.
so
thus
the
state
initially
places
them
in
a
certain
school
by
a
school
zonary.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
there's
a
transfer
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
choose
without
giving
any
reason.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
necessity
to
give
any
reason.
justice
byron

how

i

do
you
have
any
--
does
the
record
show
that?
justice
byron

now,
how
about
the

where
they

that
