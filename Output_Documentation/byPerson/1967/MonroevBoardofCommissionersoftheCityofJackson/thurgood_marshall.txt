mr.
nabrit,
just
a
point
of
information,
you
mentioned
the
washington
douglas
elementary
school
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
know
if
it
was
(inaudible)
or
george,
i
wouldn't
know.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
rice,
you
drew
the
line
right
in
the
middle
for
the
high
schools,
is
that
right,
in
the
middle
of
that
map.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
couldn't
you
use
that
same
line
for
the
junior
high
school?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
that
--
and
just
on
the
question
of
energy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
energy
--
wouldn't
be
easier
to
do
that
and
all
of
those
involved
in
business.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
be
willing
to
put
that
line
there
now
and
say
that
everybody
on
this
side
goes
to
that
one
junior
high
school
and
everybody
on
the
other
side
goes
to
one
or
other
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
didn't
give
you
that
freedom.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
rice,
what's
the
purpose
of
the
transfer
plan?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
transfer
plan
was
so
that
individual
people
who
had
a
desire
to
attend
the
school
of
one
racial
group
could
do
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
did
realize
that
that
was
one
of
the
reasons.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
realized
that
this
was
allowing
for
the
individuals
on
their
own
to
use
their
racial
prejudices
to
determine
which
school
they
would
go
to.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
didn't
you
realize
that
there
were
some
white
people
living
next
door
to
that
negro
high
school
that
wouldn't
go
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
do
you
think
happened
if
there
are
none
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
didn't
realize
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
didn't
realize
that
that
they
wouldn't
want
to
go
to
the
negro
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
didn't
realize
that
a
white
citizen
in
jackson,
tennessee
might
not
want
to
go
to
the
washington
douglas
school
did
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
knew
that
when
you
got
this
plan.
