mr.
russell
rice
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
was
interesting
to
me
to
listen
to
mr.
nabrit
and
to
realize
the
changes
that
can
occur
something
by
the
way
that
it
is
placed
in
the
language.
the
trial
judge
in
the
jackson,
tennessee
case
granted
summary
judgment
in
june
of
1963,
the
latter
part
of
june.
a
brand
new
school
board
took
office,
july
1,
1963
and
a
brand
new
city
attorney
took
the
job
on
july
1st
of
that
same
year.
the
first
thing
that
was
handed
to
me
when
i
went
in
there
was
what
to
do
about
this
school
summary
judgment.
and
what
they
did
do
is
upon
my
recommendation
and
i
do
in
a
way
wait
to
receive
the
motives
of
the
school
board
in
myself
impugned
with
an
absolute
barren
record
of
fact.
we
did
the
very
best
that
we
could
do
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
brown
decisions
in
this
court.
and
i'm
going
to
show
it
to
the
court
i
think
some
of
the
differences
that
exist
between
what
we
actually
did
and
the
way
that
it
has
been
stated
here
today.
first
of
all,
i
must
agree
that
i
have
never
read
the
brown
decisions
as
being
a
command
for
racial
mixing
as
such.
as
i
read
on
brown,
this
court
said,
stop
segregation
--
compulsory
segregation
and
establish
a
system
of
admissions
to
new
schools
based
on
some
other
factor
than
race
and
we've
done
that
in
jackson,
tennessee
in
our
view.
now,
this
exhibit
5
which
has
been
handed
to
you
purported
to
be
the
residence
of
people
that
live
in
a
zone,
that's
not
so.
the
residence
of
the
people
that
live
in
these
zones
appear
upon
this
large
exhibit
11,
what
you
have
here
is
a
study
of
who
attended
certain
schools
and
it
appeared
--
their
residence
appears
upon
here
but
the
residence
of
all
the
other
people
living
there
do
not
appear
here.
now,
the
initial
decision
of
our
trial
judge
allowed
those
children
attending
the
school
to
continue
in
that
school
until
graduation
regardless
of
where
they
lived.
secondly,
the
transfer
provision
was
allowed
and
thirdly,
those
who
lived
in
that
zone
had
the
uncontested
right
to
go
to
that
school
if
they
wished
to
do
so.
after
all
three
of
those
provisions
had
been
applied
and
the
student
body
had
assembled
for
the
school
year
after
transferring,
after
exercising
their
right
to
remain
if
they
had
been
attending
and
those
who
lived
in
that
zone
were
going
there,
that
is
what
appears
here.
it
does
not
show
you
the
residence
of
the
people.
it
shows
you
who
went
to
that
school
after
all
three
of
these
factors
had
been
exhausted.
so
as
far
as
zoning
is
concerned,
it
shows
this
court
nothing.
the
comments
which
are
--
mr.
russell
rice
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
rice
the
record
that
the
--
the
figures
that
your
honors
hold
in
mr.
justice
stewart
is
of
1963.
the
figures
which
i
use
in
my
brief
on
page
3
on
1965
and
i
thought
that
we
did
have
--
we
started
out
with
some
in
--
mr.
russell
rice
there
are
seven
in
tigrett
at
this
time.
mr.
russell
rice
yes
sir.
so
--
mr.
russell
rice
i
think
perhaps
--
well,
i
can't
really
--
mr.
russell
rice
i
hope
that
the
court
can
see
this,
it's
not
too
large.
the
blue
dots
on
here,
i
don't
know
how
it
got
switched
out
on
these
exhibits.
the
blue
dots
on
this
exhibit
indicate
where
the
white
children
live.
now
this
is
white
children
age
one
through
18
regardless
of
where
they
go
to
school.
this
is
just
where
they
live.
the
red
dots
on
here
indicate
where
the
negro
children
in
the
city
of
jackson
age
one
through
18
actually
live.
this
is
the
tigrett
junior
high
school,
this
is
the
merry
junior
high
school
and
this
is
the
jackson
junior
high
school.
mr.
russell
rice
mr.
justice
white,
i
sympathize
with
my
approval
problem
i
have
it
myself
but
i
wish
that
i
could
do
something
about
it
but
--
mr.
russell
rice
well
sir,
i'm
learning
to
do
anything
that
the
court
suggest
sir.
mr.
russell
rice
alright
sir.
i
do
hope
that
at
some
stage
of
the
proceeding
the
court
will
take
the
occasion
to
examine.
mr.
russell
rice
yes
sir
it
is.
but
nothing
in
--
mr.
russell
rice
yes
sir,
it
is.
in
the
record
referred
to
--
mr.
russell
rice
this
one
is
in
the
printed
record,
no
sir.
i
really
thought
that
in
bringing
this,
i'm
doing
the
right
--
mr.
russell
rice
in
the
official
record
there
is
as
an
exhibit
of
this
type
but
it
is
not
printed
in
the
appendix.
mr.
russell
rice
who
attend
the
school?
mr.
russell
rice
yes
sir.
on
page
3
in
the
brief
of
the
respondent
if
the
court
has
that
there.
the
alexander
school
--
mr.
russell
rice
well,
you
just
want
the
junior
highs
your
honor.
mr.
russell
rice
alright,
the
tigrett
junior
high
school,
this
school
out
in
the
west
has
812
white
and
7
negro
children.
it
is
in
the
predominantly
white
neighborhood.
the
entire
area
there
is
white.
mr.
russell
rice
the
jackson
junior
high
school
which
is
the
one
to
the
east
--
mr.
russell
rice
has
349
white
students
and
135
negro
students.
the
merry
junior
high
which
is
the
one
in
the
center
is
entirely
negro
having
640
negro
children
and
no
white
children.
now
the
elementary
school
--
mr.
russell
rice
primarily
your
honor
because
the
negro
children
are
preferring
to
go
there
and
whites
are
transferring
out
under
the
free
transfer.
mr.
russell
rice
no
sir.
mr.
russell
rice
i
don't
believe
that
it
does.
mr.
russell
rice
that's
a
fair
question
and
i'm
willing
to
give
the
court
a
fair
answer.
we
were
trying
to
find
natural
boundaries.
now,
if
the
court
cannot
see
this
map
at
this
time,
it's
a
little
hard
to
point
it
out
but
there
are
no
natural
boundary.
we
would
just
assume
that
boundary
lines
running
in
this
fashion
and
in
any
other
fashion,
it
would
make
no
difference
but
that
did
not
happen
to
be
any
usable
boundary
that
--
that
would
make
it
clear.
mr.
russell
rice
well,
it
has
this
factor
to
consider
your
honor.
if
you
draw
(inaudible)
across
blocks
in
every
single
street,
you've
got
the
problem
of
who
is
in
this
district
or
who
is
in
that
district.
these
are
merely,
clearly
identifiable
boundaries.
mr.
russell
rice
are
you
speaking
of
this
one
your
honor?
mr.
russell
rice
this
one
follows
a
major
highway
until
it
reaches
this
point,
the
third
west
follows
a
major
highway
to
this
point
and
follows
the
railroad
out
of
jackson.
mr.
russell
rice
i
was
thinking
of
this
one.
mr.
russell
rice
this
boundary
right
here
followed
a
major
role
all
the
way
in
town
going
in,
you
turn
west
on
the
major
road,
go
south
on
the
major
road
and
goes
out
on
a
major
road.
mr.
russell
rice
there
is
but
this
town
is
an
old
town
and
it's
caught
up
in
the
little
tiny
square
through
here
and
they
just
simply
didn't
happen
to
be
one
there
that
we
could
use
and
that
will
show
that
to
the
court.
in
fact,
these
petitioners
spoke
with
these
experts
that
came
and
examined
our
system.
the
state
quite
a
while
(inaudible)
about
it
and
i
believe
it
was
mr.
herman
was
on
the
stand,
he
objected
for
this
and
instead
he
looked
like
he
was
gerrymandered
to
him
offered
in
the
tape
as
said
mr.
herman,
you
put
your
own
lines
on
there
and
we
may
just
settle
this
lawsuit
right
now
and
he
wouldn't
touch
it.
so
we
have
no
pride
in
ownership
of
those
zones
but
they're
not
gerrymandered
in
the
sense
that
we
were
trying
to
prevent
people
from
going
to
some
school
that
they
might
otherwise
be
--
mr.
russell
rice
yes
sir
only
elementary
level.
can
the
court
see
these
green
lines
--
mr.
russell
rice
let
me
say
this.
the
first
time
that
we
presented
our
plan
to
the
court,
the
trial
judge
approved
our
district
lines.
on
the
motion
to
rehear,
he
set
it
down
for
further
hearing.
at
that
time,
after
one
year
experience,
the
school
board
of
its
own
volition
changed
this
land
right
here.
it
had
come
in,
in
this
fashion
and
across.
just
moved
it
down
to
straighten
that
line.
the
trial
judge
took
where
we
followed
that
railroad
track
down
with
this
line
right
here,
he
moved
it
over
and
came
down
that
part
right
there.
that's
the
extent
of
the
--
i
believe
that's
all
of
the
gerrymandering
that
he
found
in
the
elementary
lines.
mr.
russell
rice
oh
yes,
we
had
an
extended
hearing
on
question
of
gerrymandering
and
there
just
doesn't
happen
to
be
a
natural
boundary
to
come
there.
now,
let
me
point
this
out.
we
stipulated
with
these
petitioners
about
the
high
school
line
which
run
on
a
major
third
layer,
i
believe
as
that
one
continued
just
like
that
straight
and
i
think
that
merry
high
school,
they
have
thirty
negroes.
they
have
taken
advantage
of
the
unfettered
opportunity
to
attend
the
white
school.
the
boundary
line
--
mr.
russell
rice
it
has
this
significance
your
honor.
anybody
that
lives
in
that
district
has
the
unqualified
right
to
attend
that
school.
mr.
russell
rice
now,
we
were
told
by
this
court
to
eliminate
segregated
dual
system
and
this
display
on
right
here
sets
up
a
unitary
geographic
zone
for
every
school
that
we
have
in
our
system,
we
take
that
student
by
the
hands
and
make
him
go
in
that
school
physically
every
year
and
register
and
as
far
as
the
city
of
jackson
is
concerned
that
is
where
that
child
must
go
to
school
unless
their
parents
choose
otherwise.
mr.
russell
rice
something
like
that.
mr.
russell
rice
i
possibly
could.
mr.
russell
rice
question
of
what?
mr.
russell
rice
we
have
no
pride
of
authorship
in
those
lines
your
honor.
if
that
line
suits
this
--
mr.
russell
rice
as
long
as
the
court
allows
us
the
freedom
that
goss
gave
us.
mr.
russell
rice
well,
i'm
not
agreeable
to
do
it
because
i
don't
think
it's
constitutional
requirement.
now
when
we
prepared
this
plan
and
i
can
go
so
far
as
to
say
when
i
have
prepared.
i
had
to
look
to
see
what
this
court
told
us
to
do
and
when
i
look
at
brown,
i
stated
to
the
court
what
i
thought
brown
said
and
if
that's
not
the
law
then
i'm
wrong
but
that's
what
i
read
it
to
mean.
i
look
to
see
if
it
had
to
be
a
rigid
implacable
zoning
and
i
found
where
this
court
in
the
goss
case
went
out
of
its
way
to
tell
us
that
if
we
had
a
free
wholly
nonracial
transfer
plan
then
that
would
be
an
entirely
different
question
than
what
we
have
here
the
way
the
court
put
it.
now
why
would
that
be
of
importance?
it's
important
to
this
effect
your
honors.
now,
i
hope
this
court
recognizes
the
fact
that
jackson,
tennessee
is
probably
never
been
heard
up
here
by
this
court.
we're
not
a
racist
town.
we've
had
no
trouble.
we
don't
--
we're
not
fighting
the
problem
and
we
had
the
advantage
if
we
were
a
little
late
coming
along
but
we
had
the
advantage
and
so
be
that
we
could
look
at
what
this
court
have
had
to
say
and
try
to
do
what
we
were
supposed
to
do.
mr.
russell
rice
the
first
integration
in
jackson
was
on
a
voluntary
basis
in
1961,
i
grant
the
court
that
there
was
more
or
less
putting
the
cold
water
so
to
speak
to
see
what
the
temperature
was
but
nevertheless
that
it
was
a
move
of
considerable
magnitude
in
that
area
at
that
time.
still
in
all,
it
was
not
until
1963
that
we
were
confronted
with
court
order
desegregation.
at
any
event
in
1963
when
we
were
so
confronted
where
we
didn't
have
the
advantage
if
it
can
be
called
at
of
seeing
what
this
court
has
had
to
say
and
that's
where
we
went.
now
--
mr.
russell
rice
we
don't
think
we
are
violating
the
fourteenth
amendment
your
honor.
the
fourteenth
amendment
told
us
to
stop
doing
something.
it
didn't
tell
us
to
affirmatively
do
something
or
command
us
to
do
something.
mr.
russell
rice
i
can
say
this
to
you
your
honor
that
we
had
no
more
idea
what
would
come
of
this
than
any
judge
sitting
on
this
panel.
mr.
russell
rice
when
you
speak
of
a
community
attitude,
i
--
mr.
russell
rice
as
distinguished
from
hostile
community
attitude
because
in
our
case
--
we
haven't
got
any
hostile
community
attitudes
but
we
do
have
the
attitude
to
the
--
you
see
that
there
are
many
negroes
in
this
country
and
in
jackson,
tennessee,
we
have
a
considerable
group
who
have
great
pride
in
their
race
and
in
things
that
are
all
negro
and
i
think
it's
on
erroneous
conclusion
to
conclude
that
anything
that
is
all
negro
if
so
per
se
is
bad.
mr.
russell
rice
that's
right.
mr.
russell
rice
i
think
it
would
if
it
was
the
inevitable
result.
mr.
russell
rice
it's
not
inevitable
in
this
sense
your
honor
that
in
1966
and
‘67,
475
negro
children
took
advantage
of
the
integrated
education.
in
1967
and
‘68,
615
of
our
negro
children
are
taking
advantage
of
an
integrated
education.
all
the
white
children
are
engaged
in
an
integrated
education.
so
to
that
extent,
there
is
nothing
inevitable
about
it
when
they
register
in
september,
we
have
no
earthly
idea
whether
we
will
have
615
--
mr.
russell
rice
they
must
do
that.
mr.
russell
rice
right.
mr.
russell
rice
if
they
choose.
mr.
russell
rice
that's
right.
mr.
russell
rice
that's
correct.
we
tried
that
--
given
a
reason
and
the
trial
judge
found
that
to
be
erroneous.
that's
what
brought
on
that
other
problem
that
we
had.
so
we
abandoned
that.
every
negro
child
that
has
asked
for
a
transfer
since
august
11,
1965
had
been
granted.
mr.
russell
rice
no
sir,
we
have
not.
now
--
mr.
russell
rice
capacity
of
school.
mr.
russell
rice
capacity
of
the
school,
you
have
to
get
enough
children
in
the
school
to
use
it
efficiently
that's
all.
mr.
russell
rice
i
assume
not.
mr.
russell
rice
well
as
i
stated
it.
mr.
russell
rice
well,
the
negroes
are
all
lay
up
in
the
center
area
of
the
city
and
almost
anyway
we
diagram
it
--
we're
going
to
have
a
substantial
group
of
negroes
together.
but
as
i
state,
we
have
no
particular
pride
of
authorship
in
this
geographic
zoning.
there
are
other
ways
to
do
it.
this
happened
to
be
the
one
that
considering
the
capacity
of
the
school
in
the
streets
and
so
forth
of
how
they
get
there
in
the
natural
boundary,
that's
the
one
they
came
up
with.
mr.
russell
rice
no
sir.
mr.
russell
rice
there
is
a
city
bus
system
and
primarily
they
are
transported
either
they
walk
to
the
school
or
their
parents
bring
them.
mr.
russell
rice
i
tell
you
the
truth
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
i
just
don't
know.
mr.
russell
rice
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
rice
are
you
speaking
here?
mr.
russell
rice
well,
if
these
over
here
wanted
to
go
there,
they'd
have
to
get
there
somehow
and
--
mr.
russell
rice
no
sir,
you
find
your
--
you
find
your
planned
area
of
our
city
on
the
outskirts.
this
is
an
old
town
and
it's
just
simply
has
chopped
up
like
court
--
mr.
russell
rice
to
point
out
to
the
court,
i
looked
at
the
appendix
for
a
moment
and
i
found
that
exhibits
one
through
nine
of
the
defendants
in
the
court
below
were
consolidated
on
to
this
exhibit
which
is
exhibit
11.
the
smaller
exhibits
were
not
printed
because
i
had
thought
that
this
would
be
by
far
the
best
exhibit
to
use
but
in
any
event
those
smaller
exhibits
are
in
the
record
if
that's
in
any
consequence
to
the
court.
mr.
russell
rice
they
are
the
defendant's
exhibits
below.
mr.
russell
rice
now,
in
the
short
term
that
i
have
left,
there
are
one
or
two
points
that
i
would
like
to
touch
upon.
in
connection
with
that
transfer
plan
which
we
consider
to
be
within
the
meaning
of
goss.
that
plan
provides
the
necessary
element
of
flexibility
to
our
plan
which
assures
that
this
plan
will
in
fact
work.
if
it
were
rigid,
we
would
have
the
immediate
reaction
of
resegregation.
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
if
we
discarded
our
transfer
plan
and
made
this
a
rigid
zoning
plan
within
three
years,
it
would
not
be
a
blue
dot
to
the
right
of
the
line.
now,
that
may
sound
like
community
hostility.
i
don't
think
that
it
is
community
hostility.
there
was
an
article
on
that
very
question
in
the
new
york
times,
march
24th
which
was
an
analysis
of
that
type
of
problem
by
some
west
coast
sociologist
and
it
had
so
much
sense
in
it
and
those
people
understand
what
we
have
against
it
--
so
thorough
that
i
had
it
reproduced
and
it
is
in
a
supplement
to
this
rather
voluminous
appendix
which
i
filed
here.
i
am
sorry
that
that
appendix
was
so
long
but
the
importance
of
this
key
is
we
felt
like
that
the
voice
of
the
educator
should
be
here
and
at
considerable
trouble
we
have
amassed
in
our
appendix
what
we
consider
to
be
the
educational
information
that
is
vital
to
the
determination
of
the
question
before
this
court.
mr.
russell
rice
the
record
itself
is
an
appeal
from
the
district
court
order
telling
us
to
see
that
it
is
free.
mr.
russell
rice
you
mean
here
back
to
the
august
11th?
mr.
russell
rice
the
court
has
never
found
that
we
or
in
bad
faith
--
now,
they
did
find
this
--
mr.
russell
rice
up
to
the
time
of
august
11,
1965
decision,
the
court
said
that
we
were
not
granting
every
negro
child
a
transfer
and
that
sets
every
white
child
to
get
a
transfer
that
we
were
an
error
and
they
fine
us
a
thousand
dollars
for
that.
now,
i
might
point
this
out.
mr.
russell
rice
in
the
courts
conclusion,
i
think
that
would
have
to
be
the
conclusion,
yes
sir.
and
he
told
us
to
stop
it.
now
since
august
11,
1965,
i
state
to
this
court
upon
paying
of
this
(inaudible)
without
any
question
that
there
has
not
been
a
negro
child
denied
a
transfer
in
the
city
of
jackson,
in
these
three
school
years,
not
one.
mr.
russell
rice
there
are
seven
negro
children
in
there
and
everyone
that
has
asked
to
go
there
has
been
allowed
to
go
there.
mr.
russell
rice
yes
sir.
we
gave
serious
consideration
--
i
don't
suppose
this
is
really
partnered
but
we
did
consider
appealing
that
proposition
from
the
district
court
but
you
know,
we
have
other
things
to
consider
to
carry
on
that
litigation,
to
keep
the
pot
boiling.
it
was
worth
a
thousand
dollars
to
--
let's
just
get
it
or
the
way
to
the
keep
the
community
and
get
all
of
that
business
of
education
and
that's
neither
here
to
there
but
that
happened
to
be
the
consideration
upon
which
we
decided
to
let
it
drop
because
you
try
not
to
stir
these
things
anymore
than
you
can
have.
mr.
russell
rice
the
difference
between
us
mr.
justice
black
is
that
they
want
us
to
compulsorily
assign
white
children
to
what
has
been
the
formerly
negro
schools.
in
other
words,
they
want
us
to
substitute
compulsory
assignment
on
the
basis
of
race
for
elimination
of
segregation
based
upon
race.
mr.
russell
rice
right.
mr.
russell
rice
and
white
children
vice
versa
into
the
negro
school.
that's
the
--
mr.
russell
rice
our
position
is
that
the
constitution
told
us
to
stop
discrimination
and
then
we
have
so
stopped
that
it
does
not
require
a
racial
mixing
to
any
of
the
--
they
don't
define
what
formula
but
that
it
does
not
actually
require
the
state
to
compulsorily
assign
somebody
in
order
to
achieve
racial
mixing
in
any
particular
school.
mr.
russell
rice
well,
the
maximum,
i
would
say
its
three
miles.
mr.
russell
rice
if
they
were
assigned
over
there,
they
would
have
to
get
there
somehow.
mr.
russell
rice
no
sir.
mr.
russell
rice
no
sir.
our
bus
system
--
mr.
russell
rice
yes
sir.
this
is
the
downtown
area
of
jackson,
tennessee
where
my
finger
is.
all
bus
systems
come
in
there
like
fingers
or
a
hand.
they
come
to
the
center
and
transfer
and
go
back
out.
it
applies
that
way
in
all
of
the
city.
mr.
russell
rice
ride
the
city
buses
to
town
transfer
and
then
ride
back
up,
it
would
be
six
to
seven
miles
trip.
mr.
russell
rice
the
regular
fare
your
honor
is
$0.25.i
frankly
--
mr.
russell
rice
but
i
do
not
know
for
certain
whether
there
is
a
reduced
fare
on
not.
i
think
there
is
but
i
can't
say
for
any
degree
of
accuracy
that
that's
true.
i
think
its
$0.15
but
i
don't
know
that.
mr.
russell
rice
the
purpose
of
the
transfer
plan
mr.
justice
marshall
is
simply
this,
that
at
the
level
at
which
i
operate,
which
is
at
the
school
board
level,
we
have
to
deal
in
possibilities.
we
are
not
permitted
the
luxury
of
dealing
in
theory
or
utopian
ideas.
we
have
to
deal
in
possibilities
and
that
transfer
plan
allows
enough
flexibility.
it
let's
the
citizens
of
that
town
give
and
take
in
accordance
with
their
desire
to
some
degree.
at
the
same
time
it
guarantees
them
the
right
to
go
to
the
school
in
that
district
if
they
want
to
do
that.
that
assures
that
that
transfer
plan
is
not
going
to
segregate
our
school,
our
city
just
half
into
on
a
racial
line.
we
now
live
together,
play
together,
work
together,
go
to
school
together
and
we
do
extremely
well
in
our
community
in
view
of
the
uncontrolled
forces
that
are
now
losing
this
country.
mr.
russell
rice
for
any
reason.
mr.
russell
rice
we
did
realize
your
honor
that
the
goss
case
told
us
that
a
transfer
that
was
utterly
free
without
racial
consideration
was
satisfactory.
mr.
russell
rice
i
don't
know
that
i
realized
that
at
all
your
honor.
mr.
russell
rice
i
have
no
idea
--
we
thought
there
was
a
good
chance
and
we
wondered
what
we
would
do.
mr.
russell
rice
they
don't
wish
to
go
there
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
russell
rice
sir?
mr.
russell
rice
i
had
no
idea
what
they
would
do.
mr.
russell
rice
i'm
sure
--
i'm
reasonably
sure
that
the
white
people
would
not
want
to
go
there
--
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
rice
well,
of
course
i
know
it,
yes
sir.
but
that
was
not
the
basis
of
this
plan.
we
look
to
the
supreme
court
to
tell
us
what
to
do
and
that's
what
we
found.
mr.
russell
rice
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
rice
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
rice
in
the
--
i
have
to
guess
--
mr.
russell
rice
the
district
of
the
jackson
junior
high
school
or
i
would
say
would
be
about
25%
negro
and
75%
white.
the
district
in
the
center
which
is
the
merry
junior
high
school
would
be
in
the
neighborhood
of
70%
negro
and
30%
white.
the
tigrett
junior
high
would
perhaps
be
80:20
something
of
that
type.
mr.
russell
rice
this
is
merry
junior
high.
mr.
russell
rice
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
about
it
your
honor.
mr.
russell
rice
on
basis
of
race,
yes.
mr.
russell
rice
if
i
understand
--
understood
you
your
honor,
i
think
that
that's
very
close.
mr.
russell
rice
well,
i'm
not
really
sure
that
i
did
understand.
mr.
russell
rice
on
the
basis
of
race,
yes.
mr.
russell
rice
well,
that's
the
big
difference
because
the
petitioners
contend
here
that
they
should
--
if
necessary,
they
should
be
compelled
because
they
are
white
to
go
to
a
negro
school
--
formerly
negro
school
--
mr.
russell
rice
on
our
side
of
the
picture
mr.
justice
black,
it's
our
position.
mr.
russell
rice
yes,
that
is
right.
you
see
mr.
justice
black,
here
is
what
we're
up
against.
now,
i'm
talking
to
educationally,
now
we're
here
on
an
equity
posture
and
i
think
the
real
equity
in
this
thing
at
least
in
our
view,
the
real
equity
here
is
the
education
of
children
and
that's
the
only
function
we
have
and
i
think
that
it
can
be
--
that
here
is
our
position
on
this,
that
integration
on
integrated
education
maybe
helpful
to
some
children.
we
think
that
there's
no
question
that
an
integrated
education
maybe
harmful
to
some
children.
the
government
in
their
brief
in
making
a
point
that
there
ought
to
be
no
transfer
point
out
that
while
there
are
no
gross
abuses
here,
they
took
about
this
more
subtle
type
influence
such
as
fear
whether
it's
founded
or
unfounded,
emotional
instability,
apathy,
fear
of
being
unwelcome
--
at
any
point
that
those
as
being
a
reason
why
there
should
be
no
transfer.
i
can
say
to
this
court
in
all
honesty
that
educationally
speaking,
that
is
the
child
who
absolutely
needs
the
right
to
stay
out
of
an
integrated
education.
we
cannot
educate
a
child
under
those
conditions.
mr.
russell
rice
no
sir
but
i
can
tell
the
court.
in
this
‘67
and
‘68
year
in
which
we
now
are
in,
111
negro
children
transferred
from
predominantly
negro
schools
into
predominantly
white
schools.
mr.
russell
rice
303
negro
children
transferred
from
predominantly
white
schools
into
predominantly
negro
schools
of
the
white
children
transferred
from
predominantly
negro
schools
to
predominantly
white
schools,
269.
so
to
--
mr.
russell
rice
well,
i
really
can't
say
because
we
don't
have
--
we
didn't
have
that
before
us
when
we
were
trying
to
work
this
up.
we
think
that
we
need
--
we
think
any
school
department
--
mr.
russell
rice
well,
let
me
talk
about
what
we
had
before
segregation
was
knocked
out.
we
had
what
amounted
to
a
free
transfer
if
we
had
room
for
the
people
to
go.
there
are
many
reasons
why
people
wish
to
transfer
and
we
tried
to
accommodate
our
--
mr.
russell
rice
perhaps
not
as
absolute
as
this
case
because
of
the
terminology
of
the
goss
case
but
we
did
have
a
--
you
see
the
school
is
for
the
people
and
where
we've
got
capacity
and
the
ability
to
accommodate
somebody
without
damaging
the
system,
we've
always
tried
to
do
that.
mr.
russell
rice
mr.
justice
warren,
i'm
not
acquainted
with
that
case
and
i
really
would
be
reluctant
to
answer
you
without
knowing
the
basis
of
it.
mr.
russell
rice
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
was
interesting
to
me
to
listen
to
mr.
nabrit
and
to
realize
the
changes
that
can
occur
something
by
the
way
that
it
is
placed
in
the
language.
the
trial
judge
in
the
jackson,
tennessee
case
granted
summary
judgment
in
june
of
1963,
the
latter
part
of
june.
a
brand
new
school
board
took
office,
july
1,
1963
and
a
brand
new
city
attorney
took
the
job
on
july
1st
of
that
same
year.
the
first
thing
that
was
handed
to
me
when
i
went
in
there
was
what
to
do
about
this
school
summary
judgment.
and
what
they
did
do
is
upon
my
recommendation
and
i
do
in
a
way
wait
to
receive
the
motives
of
the
school
board
in
myself
impugned
with
an
absolute
barren
record
of
fact.
we
did
the
very
best
that
we
could
do
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
brown
decisions
in
this
court.
and
i'm
going
to
show
it
to
the
court
i
think
some
of
the
differences
that
exist
between
what
we
actually
did
and
the
way
that
it
has
been
stated
here
today.
first
of
all,
i
must
agree
that
i
have
never
read
the
brown
decisions
as
being
a
command
for
racial
mixing
as
such.
as
i
read
on
brown,
this
court
said,
stop
segregation
--
compulsory
segregation
and
establish
a
system
of
admissions
to
new
schools
based
on
some
other
factor
than
race
and
we've
done
that
in
jackson,
tennessee
in
our
view.
now,
this
exhibit
5
which
has
been
handed
to
you
purported
to
be
the
residence
of
people
that
live
in
a
zone,
that's
not
so.
the
residence
of
the
people
that
live
in
these
zones
appear
upon
this
large
exhibit
11,
what
you
have
here
is
a
study
of
who
attended
certain
schools
and
it
appeared
--
their
residence
appears
upon
here
but
the
residence
of
all
the
other
people
living
there
do
not
appear
here.
now,
the
initial
decision
of
our
trial
judge
allowed
those
children
attending
the
school
to
continue
in
that
school
until
graduation
regardless
of
where
they
lived.
secondly,
the
transfer
provision
was
allowed
and
thirdly,
those
who
lived
in
that
zone
had
the
uncontested
right
to
go
to
that
school
if
they
wished
to
do
so.
after
all
three
of
those
provisions
had
been
applied
and
the
student
body
had
assembled
for
the
school
year
after
transferring,
after
exercising
their
right
to
remain
if
they
had
been
attending
and
those
who
lived
in
that
zone
were
going
there,
that
is
what
appears
here.
it
does
not
show
you
the
residence
of
the
people.
it
shows
you
who
went
to
that
school
after
all
three
of
these
factors
had
been
exhausted.
so
as
far
as
zoning
is
concerned,
it
shows
this
court
nothing.
the
comments
which
are
--
mr.
russell
rice
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
rice
the
record
that
the
--
the
figures
that
your
honors
hold
in
mr.
justice
stewart
is
of
1963.
the
figures
which
i
use
in
my
brief
on
page
3
on
1965
and
i
thought
that
we
did
have
--
we
started
out
with
some
in
--
mr.
russell
rice
there
are
seven
in
tigrett
at
this
time.
mr.
russell
rice
yes
sir.
so
--
mr.
russell
rice
i
think
perhaps
--
well,
i
can't
really
--
mr.
russell
rice
i
hope
that
the
court
can
see
this,
it's
not
too
large.
the
blue
dots
on
here,
i
don't
know
how
it
got
switched
out
on
these
exhibits.
the
blue
dots
on
this
exhibit
indicate
where
the
white
children
live.
now
this
is
white
children
age
one
through
18
regardless
of
where
they
go
to
school.
this
is
just
where
they
live.
the
red
dots
on
here
indicate
where
the
negro
children
in
the
city
of
jackson
age
one
through
18
actually
live.
this
is
the
tigrett
junior
high
school,
this
is
the
merry
junior
high
school
and
this
is
the
jackson
junior
high
school.
mr.
russell
rice
mr.
justice
white,
i
sympathize
with
my
approval
problem
i
have
it
myself
but
i
wish
that
i
could
do
something
about
it
but
--
mr.
russell
rice
well
sir,
i'm
learning
to
do
anything
that
the
court
suggest
sir.
mr.
russell
rice
alright
sir.
i
do
hope
that
at
some
stage
of
the
proceeding
the
court
will
take
the
occasion
to
examine.
mr.
russell
rice
yes
sir
it
is.
but
nothing
in
--
mr.
russell
rice
yes
sir,
it
is.
in
the
record
referred
to
--
mr.
russell
rice
this
one
is
in
the
printed
record,
no
sir.
i
really
thought
that
in
bringing
this,
i'm
doing
the
right
--
mr.
russell
rice
in
the
official
record
there
is
as
an
exhibit
of
this
type
but
it
is
not
printed
in
the
appendix.
mr.
russell
rice
who
attend
the
school?
mr.
russell
rice
yes
sir.
on
page
3
in
the
brief
of
the
respondent
if
the
court
has
that
there.
the
alexander
school
--
mr.
russell
rice
well,
you
just
want
the
junior
highs
your
honor.
mr.
russell
rice
alright,
the
tigrett
junior
high
school,
this
school
out
in
the
west
has
812
white
and
7
negro
children.
it
is
in
the
predominantly
white
neighborhood.
the
entire
area
there
is
white.
mr.
russell
rice
the
jackson
junior
high
school
which
is
the
one
to
the
east
--
mr.
russell
rice
has
349
white
students
and
135
negro
students.
the
merry
junior
high
which
is
the
one
in
the
center
is
entirely
negro
having
640
negro
children
and
no
white
children.
now
the
elementary
school
--
mr.
russell
rice
primarily
your
honor
because
the
negro
children
are
preferring
to
go
there
and
whites
are
transferring
out
under
the
free
transfer.
mr.
russell
rice
no
sir.
mr.
russell
rice
i
don't
believe
that
it
does.
mr.
russell
rice
that's
a
fair
question
and
i'm
willing
to
give
the
court
a
fair
answer.
we
were
trying
to
find
natural
boundaries.
now,
if
the
court
cannot
see
this
map
at
this
time,
it's
a
little
hard
to
point
it
out
but
there
are
no
natural
boundary.
we
would
just
assume
that
boundary
lines
running
in
this
fashion
and
in
any
other
fashion,
it
would
make
no
difference
but
that
did
not
happen
to
be
any
usable
boundary
that
--
that
would
make
it
clear.
mr.
russell
rice
well,
it
has
this
factor
to
consider
your
honor.
if
you
draw
(inaudible)
across
blocks
in
every
single
street,
you've
got
the
problem
of
who
is
in
this
district
or
who
is
in
that
district.
these
are
merely,
clearly
identifiable
boundaries.
mr.
russell
rice
are
you
speaking
of
this
one
your
honor?
mr.
russell
rice
this
one
follows
a
major
highway
until
it
reaches
this
point,
the
third
west
follows
a
major
highway
to
this
point
and
follows
the
railroad
out
of
jackson.
mr.
russell
rice
i
was
thinking
of
this
one.
mr.
russell
rice
this
boundary
right
here
followed
a
major
role
all
the
way
in
town
going
in,
you
turn
west
on
the
major
road,
go
south
on
the
major
road
and
goes
out
on
a
major
road.
mr.
russell
rice
there
is
but
this
town
is
an
old
town
and
it's
caught
up
in
the
little
tiny
square
through
here
and
they
just
simply
didn't
happen
to
be
one
there
that
we
could
use
and
that
will
show
that
to
the
court.
in
fact,
these
petitioners
spoke
with
these
experts
that
came
and
examined
our
system.
the
state
quite
a
while
(inaudible)
about
it
and
i
believe
it
was
mr.
herman
was
on
the
stand,
he
objected
for
this
and
instead
he
looked
like
he
was
gerrymandered
to
him
offered
in
the
tape
as
said
mr.
herman,
you
put
your
own
lines
on
there
and
we
may
just
settle
this
lawsuit
right
now
and
he
wouldn't
touch
it.
so
we
have
no
pride
in
ownership
of
those
zones
but
they're
not
gerrymandered
in
the
sense
that
we
were
trying
to
prevent
people
from
going
to
some
school
that
they
might
otherwise
be
--
mr.
russell
rice
yes
sir
only
elementary
level.
can
the
court
see
these
green
lines
--
mr.
russell
rice
let
me
say
this.
the
first
time
that
we
presented
our
plan
to
the
court,
the
trial
judge
approved
our
district
lines.
on
the
motion
to
rehear,
he
set
it
down
for
further
hearing.
at
that
time,
after
one
year
experience,
the
school
board
of
its
own
volition
changed
this
land
right
here.
it
had
come
in,
in
this
fashion
and
across.
just
moved
it
down
to
straighten
that
line.
the
trial
judge
took
where
we
followed
that
railroad
track
down
with
this
line
right
here,
he
moved
it
over
and
came
down
that
part
right
there.
that's
the
extent
of
the
--
i
believe
that's
all
of
the
gerrymandering
that
he
found
in
the
elementary
lines.
mr.
russell
rice
oh
yes,
we
had
an
extended
hearing
on
question
of
gerrymandering
and
there
just
doesn't
happen
to
be
a
natural
boundary
to
come
there.
now,
let
me
point
this
out.
we
stipulated
with
these
petitioners
about
the
high
school
line
which
run
on
a
major
third
layer,
i
believe
as
that
one
continued
just
like
that
straight
and
i
think
that
merry
high
school,
they
have
thirty
negroes.
they
have
taken
advantage
of
the
unfettered
opportunity
to
attend
the
white
school.
the
boundary
line
--
mr.
russell
rice
it
has
this
significance
your
honor.
anybody
that
lives
in
that
district
has
the
unqualified
right
to
attend
that
school.
mr.
russell
rice
now,
we
were
told
by
this
court
to
eliminate
segregated
dual
system
and
this
display
on
right
here
sets
up
a
unitary
geographic
zone
for
every
school
that
we
have
in
our
system,
we
take
that
student
by
the
hands
and
make
him
go
in
that
school
physically
every
year
and
register
and
as
far
as
the
city
of
jackson
is
concerned
that
is
where
that
child
must
go
to
school
unless
their
parents
choose
otherwise.
mr.
russell
rice
something
like
that.
mr.
russell
rice
i
possibly
could.
mr.
russell
rice
question
of
what?
mr.
russell
rice
we
have
no
pride
of
authorship
in
those
lines
your
honor.
if
that
line
suits
this
--
mr.
russell
rice
as
long
as
the
court
allows
us
the
freedom
that
goss
gave
us.
mr.
russell
rice
well,
i'm
not
agreeable
to
do
it
because
i
don't
think
it's
constitutional
requirement.
now
when
we
prepared
this
plan
and
i
can
go
so
far
as
to
say
when
i
have
prepared.
i
had
to
look
to
see
what
this
court
told
us
to
do
and
when
i
look
at
brown,
i
stated
to
the
court
what
i
thought
brown
said
and
if
that's
not
the
law
then
i'm
wrong
but
that's
what
i
read
it
to
mean.
i
look
to
see
if
it
had
to
be
a
rigid
implacable
zoning
and
i
found
where
this
court
in
the
goss
case
went
out
of
its
way
to
tell
us
that
if
we
had
a
free
wholly
nonracial
transfer
plan
then
that
would
be
an
entirely
different
question
than
what
we
have
here
the
way
the
court
put
it.
now
why
would
that
be
of
importance?
it's
important
to
this
effect
your
honors.
now,
i
hope
this
court
recognizes
the
fact
that
jackson,
tennessee
is
probably
never
been
heard
up
here
by
this
court.
we're
not
a
racist
town.
we've
had
no
trouble.
we
don't
--
we're
not
fighting
the
problem
and
we
had
the
advantage
if
we
were
a
little
late
coming
along
but
we
had
the
advantage
and
so
be
that
we
could
look
at
what
this
court
have
had
to
say
and
try
to
do
what
we
were
supposed
to
do.
mr.
russell
rice
the
first
integration
in
jackson
was
on
a
voluntary
basis
in
1961,
i
grant
the
court
that
there
was
more
or
less
putting
the
cold
water
so
to
speak
to
see
what
the
temperature
was
but
nevertheless
that
it
was
a
move
of
considerable
magnitude
in
that
area
at
that
time.
still
in
all,
it
was
not
until
1963
that
we
were
confronted
with
court
order
desegregation.
at
any
event
in
1963
when
we
were
so
confronted
where
we
didn't
have
the
advantage
if
it
can
be
called
at
of
seeing
what
this
court
has
had
to
say
and
that's
where
we
went.
now
--
mr.
russell
rice
we
don't
think
we
are
violating
the
fourteenth
amendment
your
honor.
the
fourteenth
amendment
told
us
to
stop
doing
something.
it
didn't
tell
us
to
affirmatively
do
something
or
command
us
to
do
something.
mr.
russell
rice
i
can
say
this
to
you
your
honor
that
we
had
no
more
idea
what
would
come
of
this
than
any
judge
sitting
on
this
panel.
mr.
russell
rice
when
you
speak
of
a
community
attitude,
i
--
mr.
russell
rice
as
distinguished
from
hostile
community
attitude
because
in
our
case
--
we
haven't
got
any
hostile
community
attitudes
but
we
do
have
the
attitude
to
the
--
you
see
that
there
are
many
negroes
in
this
country
and
in
jackson,
tennessee,
we
have
a
considerable
group
who
have
great
pride
in
their
race
and
in
things
that
are
all
negro
and
i
think
it's
on
erroneous
conclusion
to
conclude
that
anything
that
is
all
negro
if
so
per
se
is
bad.
mr.
russell
rice
that's
right.
mr.
russell
rice
i
think
it
would
if
it
was
the
inevitable
result.
mr.
russell
rice
it's
not
inevitable
in
this
sense
your
honor
that
in
1966
and
‘67,
475
negro
children
took
advantage
of
the
integrated
education.
in
1967
and
‘68,
615
of
our
negro
children
are
taking
advantage
of
an
integrated
education.
all
the
white
children
are
engaged
in
an
integrated
education.
so
to
that
extent,
there
is
nothing
inevitable
about
it
when
they
register
in
september,
we
have
no
earthly
idea
whether
we
will
have
615
--
mr.
russell
rice
they
must
do
that.
mr.
russell
rice
right.
mr.
russell
rice
if
they
choose.
mr.
russell
rice
that's
right.
mr.
russell
rice
that's
correct.
we
tried
that
--
given
a
reason
and
the
trial
judge
found
that
to
be
erroneous.
that's
what
brought
on
that
other
problem
that
we
had.
so
we
abandoned
that.
every
negro
child
that
has
asked
for
a
transfer
since
august
11,
1965
had
been
granted.
mr.
russell
rice
no
sir,
we
have
not.
now
--
mr.
russell
rice
capacity
of
school.
mr.
russell
rice
capacity
of
the
school,
you
have
to
get
enough
children
in
the
school
to
use
it
efficiently
that's
all.
mr.
russell
rice
i
assume
not.
mr.
russell
rice
well
as
i
stated
it.
mr.
russell
rice
well,
the
negroes
are
all
lay
up
in
the
center
area
of
the
city
and
almost
anyway
we
diagram
it
--
we're
going
to
have
a
substantial
group
of
negroes
together.
but
as
i
state,
we
have
no
particular
pride
of
authorship
in
this
geographic
zoning.
there
are
other
ways
to
do
it.
this
happened
to
be
the
one
that
considering
the
capacity
of
the
school
in
the
streets
and
so
forth
of
how
they
get
there
in
the
natural
boundary,
that's
the
one
they
came
up
with.
mr.
russell
rice
no
sir.
mr.
russell
rice
there
is
a
city
bus
system
and
primarily
they
are
transported
either
they
walk
to
the
school
or
their
parents
bring
them.
mr.
russell
rice
i
tell
you
the
truth
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
i
just
don't
know.
mr.
russell
rice
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
rice
are
you
speaking
here?
mr.
russell
rice
well,
if
these
over
here
wanted
to
go
there,
they'd
have
to
get
there
somehow
and
--
mr.
russell
rice
no
sir,
you
find
your
--
you
find
your
planned
area
of
our
city
on
the
outskirts.
this
is
an
old
town
and
it's
just
simply
has
chopped
up
like
court
--
mr.
russell
rice
to
point
out
to
the
court,
i
looked
at
the
appendix
for
a
moment
and
i
found
that
exhibits
one
through
nine
of
the
defendants
in
the
court
below
were
consolidated
on
to
this
exhibit
which
is
exhibit
11.
the
smaller
exhibits
were
not
printed
because
i
had
thought
that
this
would
be
by
far
the
best
exhibit
to
use
but
in
any
event
those
smaller
exhibits
are
in
the
record
if
that's
in
any
consequence
to
the
court.
mr.
russell
rice
they
are
the
defendant's
exhibits
below.
mr.
russell
rice
now,
in
the
short
term
that
i
have
left,
there
are
one
or
two
points
that
i
would
like
to
touch
upon.
in
connection
with
that
transfer
plan
which
we
consider
to
be
within
the
meaning
of
goss.
that
plan
provides
the
necessary
element
of
flexibility
to
our
plan
which
assures
that
this
plan
will
in
fact
work.
if
it
were
rigid,
we
would
have
the
immediate
reaction
of
resegregation.
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
if
we
discarded
our
transfer
plan
and
made
this
a
rigid
zoning
plan
within
three
years,
it
would
not
be
a
blue
dot
to
the
right
of
the
line.
now,
that
may
sound
like
community
hostility.
i
don't
think
that
it
is
community
hostility.
there
was
an
article
on
that
very
question
in
the
new
york
times,
march
24th
which
was
an
analysis
of
that
type
of
problem
by
some
west
coast
sociologist
and
it
had
so
much
sense
in
it
and
those
people
understand
what
we
have
against
it
--
so
thorough
that
i
had
it
reproduced
and
it
is
in
a
supplement
to
this
rather
voluminous
appendix
which
i
filed
here.
i
am
sorry
that
that
appendix
was
so
long
but
the
importance
of
this
key
is
we
felt
like
that
the
voice
of
the
educator
should
be
here
and
at
considerable
trouble
we
have
amassed
in
our
appendix
what
we
consider
to
be
the
educational
information
that
is
vital
to
the
determination
of
the
question
before
this
court.
mr.
russell
rice
the
record
itself
is
an
appeal
from
the
district
court
order
telling
us
to
see
that
it
is
free.
mr.
russell
rice
you
mean
here
back
to
the
august
11th?
mr.
russell
rice
the
court
has
never
found
that
we
or
in
bad
faith
--
now,
they
did
find
this
--
mr.
russell
rice
up
to
the
time
of
august
11,
1965
decision,
the
court
said
that
we
were
not
granting
every
negro
child
a
transfer
and
that
sets
every
white
child
to
get
a
transfer
that
we
were
an
error
and
they
fine
us
a
thousand
dollars
for
that.
now,
i
might
point
this
out.
mr.
russell
rice
in
the
courts
conclusion,
i
think
that
would
have
to
be
the
conclusion,
yes
sir.
and
he
told
us
to
stop
it.
now
since
august
11,
1965,
i
state
to
this
court
upon
paying
of
this
(inaudible)
without
any
question
that
there
has
not
been
a
negro
child
denied
a
transfer
in
the
city
of
jackson,
in
these
three
school
years,
not
one.
mr.
russell
rice
there
are
seven
negro
children
in
there
and
everyone
that
has
asked
to
go
there
has
been
allowed
to
go
there.
mr.
russell
rice
yes
sir.
we
gave
serious
consideration
--
i
don't
suppose
this
is
really
partnered
but
we
did
consider
appealing
that
proposition
from
the
district
court
but
you
know,
we
have
other
things
to
consider
to
carry
on
that
litigation,
to
keep
the
pot
boiling.
it
was
worth
a
thousand
dollars
to
--
let's
just
get
it
or
the
way
to
the
keep
the
community
and
get
all
of
that
business
of
education
and
that's
neither
here
to
there
but
that
happened
to
be
the
consideration
upon
which
we
decided
to
let
it
drop
because
you
try
not
to
stir
these
things
anymore
than
you
can
have.
mr.
russell
rice
the
difference
between
us
mr.
justice
black
is
that
they
want
us
to
compulsorily
assign
white
children
to
what
has
been
the
formerly
negro
schools.
in
other
words,
they
want
us
to
substitute
compulsory
assignment
on
the
basis
of
race
for
elimination
of
segregation
based
upon
race.
mr.
russell
rice
right.
mr.
russell
rice
and
white
children
vice
versa
into
the
negro
school.
that's
the
--
mr.
russell
rice
our
position
is
that
the
constitution
told
us
to
stop
discrimination
and
then
we
have
so
stopped
that
it
does
not
require
a
racial
mixing
to
any
of
the
--
they
don't
define
what
formula
but
that
it
does
not
actually
require
the
state
to
compulsorily
assign
somebody
in
order
to
achieve
racial
mixing
in
any
particular
school.
mr.
russell
rice
well,
the
maximum,
i
would
say
its
three
miles.
mr.
russell
rice
if
they
were
assigned
over
there,
they
would
have
to
get
there
somehow.
mr.
russell
rice
no
sir.
mr.
russell
rice
no
sir.
our
bus
system
--
mr.
russell
rice
yes
sir.
this
is
the
downtown
area
of
jackson,
tennessee
where
my
finger
is.
all
bus
systems
come
in
there
like
fingers
or
a
hand.
they
come
to
the
center
and
transfer
and
go
back
out.
it
applies
that
way
in
all
of
the
city.
mr.
russell
rice
ride
the
city
buses
to
town
transfer
and
then
ride
back
up,
it
would
be
six
to
seven
miles
trip.
mr.
russell
rice
the
regular
fare
your
honor
is
$0.25.i
frankly
--
mr.
russell
rice
but
i
do
not
know
for
certain
whether
there
is
a
reduced
fare
on
not.
i
think
there
is
but
i
can't
say
for
any
degree
of
accuracy
that
that's
true.
i
think
its
$0.15
but
i
don't
know
that.
mr.
russell
rice
the
purpose
of
the
transfer
plan
mr.
justice
marshall
is
simply
this,
that
at
the
level
at
which
i
operate,
which
is
at
the
school
board
level,
we
have
to
deal
in
possibilities.
we
are
not
permitted
the
luxury
of
dealing
in
theory
or
utopian
ideas.
we
have
to
deal
in
possibilities
and
that
transfer
plan
allows
enough
flexibility.
it
let's
the
citizens
of
that
town
give
and
take
in
accordance
with
their
desire
to
some
degree.
at
the
same
time
it
guarantees
them
the
right
to
go
to
the
school
in
that
district
if
they
want
to
do
that.
that
assures
that
that
transfer
plan
is
not
going
to
segregate
our
school,
our
city
just
half
into
on
a
racial
line.
we
now
live
together,
play
together,
work
together,
go
to
school
together
and
we
do
extremely
well
in
our
community
in
view
of
the
uncontrolled
forces
that
are
now
losing
this
country.
mr.
russell
rice
for
any
reason.
mr.
russell
rice
we
did
realize
your
honor
that
the
goss
case
told
us
that
a
transfer
that
was
utterly
free
without
racial
consideration
was
satisfactory.
mr.
russell
rice
i
don't
know
that
i
realized
that
at
all
your
honor.
mr.
russell
rice
i
have
no
idea
--
we
thought
there
was
a
good
chance
and
we
wondered
what
we
would
do.
mr.
russell
rice
they
don't
wish
to
go
there
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
russell
rice
sir?
mr.
russell
rice
i
had
no
idea
what
they
would
do.
mr.
russell
rice
i'm
sure
--
i'm
reasonably
sure
that
the
white
people
would
not
want
to
go
there
--
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
rice
well,
of
course
i
know
it,
yes
sir.
but
that
was
not
the
basis
of
this
plan.
we
look
to
the
supreme
court
to
tell
us
what
to
do
and
that's
what
we
found.
mr.
russell
rice
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
rice
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
rice
in
the
--
i
have
to
guess
--
mr.
russell
rice
the
district
of
the
jackson
junior
high
school
or
i
would
say
would
be
about
25%
negro
and
75%
white.
the
district
in
the
center
which
is
the
merry
junior
high
school
would
be
in
the
neighborhood
of
70%
negro
and
30%
white.
the
tigrett
junior
high
would
perhaps
be
80:20
something
of
that
type.
mr.
russell
rice
this
is
merry
junior
high.
mr.
russell
rice
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
about
it
your
honor.
mr.
russell
rice
on
basis
of
race,
yes.
mr.
russell
rice
if
i
understand
--
understood
you
your
honor,
i
think
that
that's
very
close.
mr.
russell
rice
well,
i'm
not
really
sure
that
i
did
understand.
mr.
russell
rice
on
the
basis
of
race,
yes.
mr.
russell
rice
well,
that's
the
big
difference
because
the
petitioners
contend
here
that
they
should
--
if
necessary,
they
should
be
compelled
because
they
are
white
to
go
to
a
negro
school
--
formerly
negro
school
--
mr.
russell
rice
on
our
side
of
the
picture
mr.
justice
black,
it's
our
position.
mr.
russell
rice
yes,
that
is
right.
you
see
mr.
justice
black,
here
is
what
we're
up
against.
now,
i'm
talking
to
educationally,
now
we're
here
on
an
equity
posture
and
i
think
the
real
equity
in
this
thing
at
least
in
our
view,
the
real
equity
here
is
the
education
of
children
and
that's
the
only
function
we
have
and
i
think
that
it
can
be
--
that
here
is
our
position
on
this,
that
integration
on
integrated
education
maybe
helpful
to
some
children.
we
think
that
there's
no
question
that
an
integrated
education
maybe
harmful
to
some
children.
the
government
in
their
brief
in
making
a
point
that
there
ought
to
be
no
transfer
point
out
that
while
there
are
no
gross
abuses
here,
they
took
about
this
more
subtle
type
influence
such
as
fear
whether
it's
founded
or
unfounded,
emotional
instability,
apathy,
fear
of
being
unwelcome
--
at
any
point
that
those
as
being
a
reason
why
there
should
be
no
transfer.
i
can
say
to
this
court
in
all
honesty
that
educationally
speaking,
that
is
the
child
who
absolutely
needs
the
right
to
stay
out
of
an
integrated
education.
we
cannot
educate
a
child
under
those
conditions.
mr.
russell
rice
no
sir
but
i
can
tell
the
court.
in
this
‘67
and
‘68
year
in
which
we
now
are
in,
111
negro
children
transferred
from
predominantly
negro
schools
into
predominantly
white
schools.
mr.
russell
rice
303
negro
children
transferred
from
predominantly
white
schools
into
predominantly
negro
schools
of
the
white
children
transferred
from
predominantly
negro
schools
to
predominantly
white
schools,
269.
so
to
--
mr.
russell
rice
well,
i
really
can't
say
because
we
don't
have
--
we
didn't
have
that
before
us
when
we
were
trying
to
work
this
up.
we
think
that
we
need
--
we
think
any
school
department
--
mr.
russell
rice
well,
let
me
talk
about
what
we
had
before
segregation
was
knocked
out.
we
had
what
amounted
to
a
free
transfer
if
we
had
room
for
the
people
to
go.
there
are
many
reasons
why
people
wish
to
transfer
and
we
tried
to
accommodate
our
--
mr.
russell
rice
perhaps
not
as
absolute
as
this
case
because
of
the
terminology
of
the
goss
case
but
we
did
have
a
--
you
see
the
school
is
for
the
people
and
where
we've
got
capacity
and
the
ability
to
accommodate
somebody
without
damaging
the
system,
we've
always
tried
to
do
that.
mr.
russell
rice
mr.
justice
warren,
i'm
not
acquainted
with
that
case
and
i
really
would
be
reluctant
to
answer
you
without
knowing
the
basis
of
it.
