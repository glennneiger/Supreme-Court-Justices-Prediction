justice
potter
stewart
at
least
two
other
court
of
appeals
have
done
that,
haven't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
i
guess
i
have
been
reading
judge
friendly's
opinion
in
the
bozza
case
and
judge
smith's
opinion
in
the
same
court
in
floyd
against
wilkins
and
judge
skelly
wright's
opinion
in
greenwell
--
justice
potter
stewart
all
of
them
faced
with
delli
paoli
and
all
three
of
those
judgments
reversed
convictions
under
situation
similar
to
yours
pointing
out
that
delli
paoli
stands
for
no
inflexible
rule
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
either
that
this
is
always
permissible
or
never
permissible,
but
delli
paoli
just
was
decided
on
the
facts
of
that
case.
that's
at
least
what
these
other
court
of
appeals
have
--
justice
potter
stewart
on
that
basis
even
if
the
court
were
not
willing
to
overrule
delli
paoli
to
the
extent
that
it
held
that
this
was
sometimes
permissible,
you
would
still
prevail
if
the
second
circuit
in
the
district
court's
approach
were
adopted
--
district
of
columbia's
approach
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
one
of
them
--
and
at
least
one
of
them
has
confessed?
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
agree
mr.
solicitor
general
i
suppose
that
that
in
logic
doesn't
really
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
number
3
in
the
1956
term?
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
that
delli
paoli
itself,
no?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
delli
paoli.
