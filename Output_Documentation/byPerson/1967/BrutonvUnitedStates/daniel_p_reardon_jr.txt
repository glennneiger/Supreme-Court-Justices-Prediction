mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
herein
is
whether
or
not
the
petitioner,
george
william
bruton
was
substantially
prejudiced
when
his
jury
heard
an
implicating
admission
illegally
and
unconstitutionally
obtained
from
his
co-defendant
one
william
james
evans.
the
two
men
were
jointly
tried
with
the
robbery
of
a
postal
contract
station.
the
robbery
occurred
on
april
16,
1965
in
south
st.
louis
on
south
kingshighway.
william
too
and
the
evidence
disclose
two
negroes
entered
the
robinson
jewelry
store.
mr.
robinson
was
repairing
watches
in
the
rear
of
the
store
while
an
employee
by
the
name
of
ms.
miller
was
attending
to
other
business
behind
the
desk.
she
approached
the
two
men
as
they
entered
and
began
to
wait
on
the
man
later
identified
as
evans,
william
james
evans
and
showed
him
some
engagement
rings,
subsequently
showed
him
some
watches.
while
displaying
the
watches
for
mr.
evans,
evans
displayed
a
revolver
and
she
looked
back
to
the
front
of
the
store,
wherein
the
second
negro
later
identified
as
bruton
was
also
displaying
a
revolver.
she
was
ordered
to
the
rear
of
the
jewelry
store
where
mr.
robinson
--
where
she
and
mr.
robinson
were
bound
and
order
lie
face
down.
the
evidence
disclosed
that
she,
ms.
miller
observed
mr.
bruton
for
a
period
of
some
two
minutes.
the
evidence
further
disclose
that
she
had
seen
the
co-defendant
mr.
evans
in
the
store
that
it
was
a
store
that
normally
catered
to
white
individuals
and
to
see
a
negro
was
something
extraordinary,
that
she
had
seen
mr.
evans
on
some
eight
or
ten
prior
occasions.
she
had
never
seen
the
individual
identified
as
bruton
prior
to
the
two
minutes
during
the
course
of
the
robbery.
the
robbery
produced
among
other
things
$30.00
in
postal
contract
funds.
the
individuals
left
the
robinson
jewelry
store
on
good
friday,
april
16,
1965
and
the
evidence
thereafter
concerning
the
investigation
switches
until
the
following
year.
again
on
good
friday,
this
time
april
the
eight
of
1966
wherein
mr.
evans
was
placed
in
a
line
up
by
the
st.
louis
police
department
and
identified
by
both
ms.
miller
and
mr.
robinson
as
having
been
one
of
the
perpetrators
of
the
robbery.
he
was
then
questioned
on
several
occasions
on
that
particular
day,
april
8,
1965
by
detective
farmer.
he
denied
involvement
in
the
postal
contract
station
robbery.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
evans
at
that
time
was
a
prisoner
of
the
state
of
missouri
being
held
in
the
city
jail,
awaiting
a
trial
for
armed
robbery
for
the
robbery
of
the
western
union
station.
he
is
a
matter
of
fact
at
that
time
and
to
the
knowledge
of
detective
farmer
had
an
employed
attorney
by
the
name
of
alfred
harris.
detective
farmer
learned
this
on
april
4,
1966,
four
days
before
the
line
up
that
occurred
on
april
the
8th.
after
several
series
of
questionings,
mr.
evans,
the
co-defendant
admitted
and
gave
to
detective
farmer
what
he
termed
confidential
information
wherein
he
admitted
having
perpetrated
the
robbery
of
the
robinson
jewelry
store
and
also
implicated
mr.
bruton.
there
was
no
warning
given
him
with
regard
to
his
constitutional
rights.
mr.
harris,
his
employed
attorney
as
of
prior
to
april
the
8th
was
not
informed
with
regard
to
the
interview
that
took
place.
but
in
any
event,
the
scene
now
switches
to
april
the
11th.
mr.
evans,
the
co-defendant
was
transported
back
to
the
city
jail.
he
remained
a
prisoner
of
the
state
of
missouri
but
on
april
the
11th,
detective
farmer
had
summoned
and
brought
with
him
a
postal
inspector
by
the
name
of
james
thorn.
mr.
thorn
then
administered
a
constitutional
warning
to
mr.
evans
in
the
presence
of
detective
farmer
and
obtained
from
mr.
evans
an
admission
that
he
had
in
fact
perpetrated
the
robbery
of
the
robinson
jewelry
store.
this
admission
was
adduced
in
the
trial.
this
admission
did
not
implicate
bruton.
now
then
detective
farmer
with
his
confidential
information
which
did
involve
mr.
bruton
finally
arrested
this
petitioner,
petitioner
bruton
on
april
the
25th
and
summoned
ms.
miller
to
the
police
headquarters
to
view
mr.
bruton
the
petitioner
in
a
line
up.
now
bruton
had
previously
been
placed
in
a
lineup
and
viewed
by
ms.
miller
in
november
or
december
of
1965
and
she
at
that
time
failed
to
identify
mr.
bruton.
mr.
robinson
was
not
brought
to
the
lineup
of
april
the
25th
because
he
did
not
see
the
second
man
allegedly
bruton.
in
any
event,
ms.
miller
was
able
on
the
second
occasion
to
identify
bruton
and
he
was
charged
with
this
offense,
the
robbery
of
the
postal
contract
station.
now
then
on
may
the
4th
following
the
charge
against
bruton,
inspector
thorn
again
returned
to
the
city
jail,
again
advised
evans
as
to
his
constitutional
rights
and
on
this
occasion,
the
second
interview
by
mr.
thorn,
he
obtain
from
evans
an
admission
wherein
evans
implicated
bruton.
this
admission
together
with
the
first
admission
was
objected
to
prior
to
the
trial
in
a
motion
to
suppress.
some
question
was
raised
in
the
eight
circuit
as
to
why
a
severance
was
not
requested.
in
any
event,
i
did
not
in
behalf
of
petitioner
bruton
request
a
severance
and
my
research
since
the
time
of
this
eight
circuit
argument
reveals
that
since
i
have
been
i
have
been
admitted
to
the
bar,
since
1955
and
until
mr.
bruton
went
to
trial
in
the
eastern
district
of
missouri
and
the
eastern
division,
no
severance
had
been
granted
to
any
defendant.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
the
eight
circuit
did
in
fact
hold
that
the
evans
admissions
were
poisonous
and
reversed
this
--
the
case
as
to
evans
alone
and
then
relying
upon
this
court's
opinion
in
the
delli
paoli
case
affirmed
the
conviction
as
to
mr.
bruton.
mr.
evans
was
in
fact
retried
and
found
not
guilty.
the
eight
circuit
noted
in
its
opinion
that
the
evidence
with
regard
to
mr.
evans,
the
identifying
evidence,
it
was
much
stronger
or
was
stronger.
it
was
in
fact
when
two
witnesses
identified
mr.
evans
rather
than
one
when
each
of
the
two
witnesses
that
identified
mr.
evans
claims
that
they
had
seen
him
prior
to
the
april
16,
1965
date
in
this
jewelry
store.
but
in
any
event,
the
decision
as
to
mr.
bruton
was
affirmed
relying
on
delli
paoli
saying
that
the
jury
--
presuming
that
the
jury
could
in
fact
follow
the
court's
instructions.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
argued
to
the
jury
jewelry
that
the
only
purpose
in
the
world
of
mr.
thorn,
the
postal
inspector
had
in
making
a
second
visit
to
city
jail
after
he
had
the
evans
admission.
the
only
purpose
of
the
second
visit
to
the
city
jail
was
to
prejudice
mr.
bruton,
was
to
corroborate
the
weak
identification
case
against
mr.
bruton
and
this
in
fact
he
was
able
to
do.
the
eight
circuit's
reliance
on
delli
paoli
i
submit
is
ill
founded
for
two
principal
reasons.
number
one
in
the
delli
paoli
case,
the
court
reviewed
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
evidence
and
found
the
evidence
against
that
defendant
was
very
strong.
the
evidence
against
bruton
suggest
--
i
suggest
weak
at
best.
the
second
and
more
important
reason
why
delli
paoli
is
improperly
relied
upon;
there
was
no
question
as
to
the
admissibility
of
the
admission
in
the
delli
paoli
case.
in
this
case,
the
admission
of
mr.
evans
or
the
two
admissions
had
been
in
fact
declared
unconstitutionally
obtained,
unconstitutionally
obtained
in
violation
of
the
westover
case
which
followed
and
was
decided
along
with
the
miranda
decision
at
about
the
time
or
just
shortly
prior
to
the
time
this
--
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
necessary
to
overrule
delli
paoli.
i
think
that
the
proper
rule
of
law
your
honor
is
announced
in
the
fahey
versus
connecticut
decision
of
this
court
wherein
the
question
is
raised
that
must
be
passed
upon
us
whether
or
not
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
that
this
defendant
bruton
was
in
fact
prejudiced
by
this
illegally
obtained
admission.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
his
own
admission
but
it
was
prejudicial
of
course
also
to
my
defendant
despite
that
--
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
it
is
necessary
in
order
to
obtain
another
trial
for
us
to
--
for
this
defendant.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
i
think
that
the
delli
paoli
rule
is
improper.
i
think
that
it
is
very
difficult
in
a
joint
trial
in
the
federal
court
where
you
represent
an
individual
that
he
has
made
no
admission
and
you
expect
that
you
--
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
that's
correct
and
--
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
well,
if
it
--
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
no.
if
all
we
had
is
the
admission
of
evans
that
he
--
evans
perpetrated
the
robbery
then
i
would
have
--
no
complaint.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
that's
correct
and
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
that
is
true
and
in
this
factual
situation
indeed
--
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
it
is
necessary
in
this
factual
situation
because
i
think
the
case
here
is
weak.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
i'm
quite
sure
that
they
are
highly
important
in
other
situation.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
case
can
be
distinguished
from
delli
paoli--
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
i
think
that
a
defendant
in
the
role
that
bruton
had
here
is
not
sufficiently
protected
by
an
instruction
or
the
instructions
that
this
court
had
given
which
are
--
were
not
objected
to
and
are
proper.
i
think
that
it
is
impossible
to
remove
the
prejudice
in
the
trial
of
the
case
and
i
think
it
is
recognized
best,
not
necessarily
by
lawyers
and
judges
but
by
bruton
himself
when
i
explained
to
him
his
rights
of
appeal
in
forma
pauperis
and
he
said,
i
would
like
a
new
trial
rather
than
serve
for
25
years
obviously.
but
he
said,
if
the
next
trial
is
with
evidence,
he
said
forget
it
because
he
felt
of
course
the
admission
was
damning.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
no.
in
the
brief,
they
say
that
it's
the
solicitor
general
points
out
the
rule
in
delli
paoli
is
good,
but
this
case
places
too
much
strain
upon
it.
i
came
here
of
course
representing
george
william
bruton
and
seeking
for
him
a
new
trial
but
i
don't
think
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
rule
in
delli
paoli
is
correct.
i
don't
think
--
i
think
it
places
far
too
great
of
burden
upon
12
individuals
tried
and
true,
if
they
were
to
give
you
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
if
they
are
exposed
an
admission
of
a
co-defendant.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
yes.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
yes.
that's
correct.
the
bozza
case
or
of
course
each
of
those
case
are
cited
in
my
brief
but
certainly
had
the
eight
circuit
been
of
the
same
persuasion
as
the
author
of
the
bozza
opinion,
i
doubt
that
we
would
not
be
here.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
that
is
correct.
the
matter
was
not
argued
as
a
matter
of
fact
before
the
eight
circuit.
it
was
the
eight
circuit
first
opportunity
to
review
the
miranda
holdings
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
had
briefed
that
portion
of
the
case
and
of
course
had
the
decision
reversed
for
the
wrong
client
is
the
best
that
i
could
gather
as
far
as
bruton
is
concerned.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
it
was
in
greenwell
and
--
but
not
in
bozza.
i
think
that
this
is
a
stronger
situation
of
then
certainly
then
in
the
bozza
decision
because
there,
it
was
an
admission
that
gave
devastating
corroboration
to
the
testimony
of
an
accomplice.
here,
i
think
this
is
a
stronger
situation.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
herein
is
whether
or
not
the
petitioner,
george
william
bruton
was
substantially
prejudiced
when
his
jury
heard
an
implicating
admission
illegally
and
unconstitutionally
obtained
from
his
co-defendant
one
william
james
evans.
the
two
men
were
jointly
tried
with
the
robbery
of
a
postal
contract
station.
the
robbery
occurred
on
april
16,
1965
in
south
st.
louis
on
south
kingshighway.
william
too
and
the
evidence
disclose
two
negroes
entered
the
robinson
jewelry
store.
mr.
robinson
was
repairing
watches
in
the
rear
of
the
store
while
an
employee
by
the
name
of
ms.
miller
was
attending
to
other
business
behind
the
desk.
she
approached
the
two
men
as
they
entered
and
began
to
wait
on
the
man
later
identified
as
evans,
william
james
evans
and
showed
him
some
engagement
rings,
subsequently
showed
him
some
watches.
while
displaying
the
watches
for
mr.
evans,
evans
displayed
a
revolver
and
she
looked
back
to
the
front
of
the
store,
wherein
the
second
negro
later
identified
as
bruton
was
also
displaying
a
revolver.
she
was
ordered
to
the
rear
of
the
jewelry
store
where
mr.
robinson
--
where
she
and
mr.
robinson
were
bound
and
order
lie
face
down.
the
evidence
disclosed
that
she,
ms.
miller
observed
mr.
bruton
for
a
period
of
some
two
minutes.
the
evidence
further
disclose
that
she
had
seen
the
co-defendant
mr.
evans
in
the
store
that
it
was
a
store
that
normally
catered
to
white
individuals
and
to
see
a
negro
was
something
extraordinary,
that
she
had
seen
mr.
evans
on
some
eight
or
ten
prior
occasions.
she
had
never
seen
the
individual
identified
as
bruton
prior
to
the
two
minutes
during
the
course
of
the
robbery.
the
robbery
produced
among
other
things
$30.00
in
postal
contract
funds.
the
individuals
left
the
robinson
jewelry
store
on
good
friday,
april
16,
1965
and
the
evidence
thereafter
concerning
the
investigation
switches
until
the
following
year.
again
on
good
friday,
this
time
april
the
eight
of
1966
wherein
mr.
evans
was
placed
in
a
line
up
by
the
st.
louis
police
department
and
identified
by
both
ms.
miller
and
mr.
robinson
as
having
been
one
of
the
perpetrators
of
the
robbery.
he
was
then
questioned
on
several
occasions
on
that
particular
day,
april
8,
1965
by
detective
farmer.
he
denied
involvement
in
the
postal
contract
station
robbery.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
evans
at
that
time
was
a
prisoner
of
the
state
of
missouri
being
held
in
the
city
jail,
awaiting
a
trial
for
armed
robbery
for
the
robbery
of
the
western
union
station.
he
is
a
matter
of
fact
at
that
time
and
to
the
knowledge
of
detective
farmer
had
an
employed
attorney
by
the
name
of
alfred
harris.
detective
farmer
learned
this
on
april
4,
1966,
four
days
before
the
line
up
that
occurred
on
april
the
8th.
after
several
series
of
questionings,
mr.
evans,
the
co-defendant
admitted
and
gave
to
detective
farmer
what
he
termed
confidential
information
wherein
he
admitted
having
perpetrated
the
robbery
of
the
robinson
jewelry
store
and
also
implicated
mr.
bruton.
there
was
no
warning
given
him
with
regard
to
his
constitutional
rights.
mr.
harris,
his
employed
attorney
as
of
prior
to
april
the
8th
was
not
informed
with
regard
to
the
interview
that
took
place.
but
in
any
event,
the
scene
now
switches
to
april
the
11th.
mr.
evans,
the
co-defendant
was
transported
back
to
the
city
jail.
he
remained
a
prisoner
of
the
state
of
missouri
but
on
april
the
11th,
detective
farmer
had
summoned
and
brought
with
him
a
postal
inspector
by
the
name
of
james
thorn.
mr.
thorn
then
administered
a
constitutional
warning
to
mr.
evans
in
the
presence
of
detective
farmer
and
obtained
from
mr.
evans
an
admission
that
he
had
in
fact
perpetrated
the
robbery
of
the
robinson
jewelry
store.
this
admission
was
adduced
in
the
trial.
this
admission
did
not
implicate
bruton.
now
then
detective
farmer
with
his
confidential
information
which
did
involve
mr.
bruton
finally
arrested
this
petitioner,
petitioner
bruton
on
april
the
25th
and
summoned
ms.
miller
to
the
police
headquarters
to
view
mr.
bruton
the
petitioner
in
a
line
up.
now
bruton
had
previously
been
placed
in
a
lineup
and
viewed
by
ms.
miller
in
november
or
december
of
1965
and
she
at
that
time
failed
to
identify
mr.
bruton.
mr.
robinson
was
not
brought
to
the
lineup
of
april
the
25th
because
he
did
not
see
the
second
man
allegedly
bruton.
in
any
event,
ms.
miller
was
able
on
the
second
occasion
to
identify
bruton
and
he
was
charged
with
this
offense,
the
robbery
of
the
postal
contract
station.
now
then
on
may
the
4th
following
the
charge
against
bruton,
inspector
thorn
again
returned
to
the
city
jail,
again
advised
evans
as
to
his
constitutional
rights
and
on
this
occasion,
the
second
interview
by
mr.
thorn,
he
obtain
from
evans
an
admission
wherein
evans
implicated
bruton.
this
admission
together
with
the
first
admission
was
objected
to
prior
to
the
trial
in
a
motion
to
suppress.
some
question
was
raised
in
the
eight
circuit
as
to
why
a
severance
was
not
requested.
in
any
event,
i
did
not
in
behalf
of
petitioner
bruton
request
a
severance
and
my
research
since
the
time
of
this
eight
circuit
argument
reveals
that
since
i
have
been
i
have
been
admitted
to
the
bar,
since
1955
and
until
mr.
bruton
went
to
trial
in
the
eastern
district
of
missouri
and
the
eastern
division,
no
severance
had
been
granted
to
any
defendant.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
the
eight
circuit
did
in
fact
hold
that
the
evans
admissions
were
poisonous
and
reversed
this
--
the
case
as
to
evans
alone
and
then
relying
upon
this
court's
opinion
in
the
delli
paoli
case
affirmed
the
conviction
as
to
mr.
bruton.
mr.
evans
was
in
fact
retried
and
found
not
guilty.
the
eight
circuit
noted
in
its
opinion
that
the
evidence
with
regard
to
mr.
evans,
the
identifying
evidence,
it
was
much
stronger
or
was
stronger.
it
was
in
fact
when
two
witnesses
identified
mr.
evans
rather
than
one
when
each
of
the
two
witnesses
that
identified
mr.
evans
claims
that
they
had
seen
him
prior
to
the
april
16,
1965
date
in
this
jewelry
store.
but
in
any
event,
the
decision
as
to
mr.
bruton
was
affirmed
relying
on
delli
paoli
saying
that
the
jury
--
presuming
that
the
jury
could
in
fact
follow
the
court's
instructions.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
argued
to
the
jury
jewelry
that
the
only
purpose
in
the
world
of
mr.
thorn,
the
postal
inspector
had
in
making
a
second
visit
to
city
jail
after
he
had
the
evans
admission.
the
only
purpose
of
the
second
visit
to
the
city
jail
was
to
prejudice
mr.
bruton,
was
to
corroborate
the
weak
identification
case
against
mr.
bruton
and
this
in
fact
he
was
able
to
do.
the
eight
circuit's
reliance
on
delli
paoli
i
submit
is
ill
founded
for
two
principal
reasons.
number
one
in
the
delli
paoli
case,
the
court
reviewed
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
evidence
and
found
the
evidence
against
that
defendant
was
very
strong.
the
evidence
against
bruton
suggest
--
i
suggest
weak
at
best.
the
second
and
more
important
reason
why
delli
paoli
is
improperly
relied
upon;
there
was
no
question
as
to
the
admissibility
of
the
admission
in
the
delli
paoli
case.
in
this
case,
the
admission
of
mr.
evans
or
the
two
admissions
had
been
in
fact
declared
unconstitutionally
obtained,
unconstitutionally
obtained
in
violation
of
the
westover
case
which
followed
and
was
decided
along
with
the
miranda
decision
at
about
the
time
or
just
shortly
prior
to
the
time
this
--
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
necessary
to
overrule
delli
paoli.
i
think
that
the
proper
rule
of
law
your
honor
is
announced
in
the
fahey
versus
connecticut
decision
of
this
court
wherein
the
question
is
raised
that
must
be
passed
upon
us
whether
or
not
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
that
this
defendant
bruton
was
in
fact
prejudiced
by
this
illegally
obtained
admission.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
his
own
admission
but
it
was
prejudicial
of
course
also
to
my
defendant
despite
that
--
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
it
is
necessary
in
order
to
obtain
another
trial
for
us
to
--
for
this
defendant.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
i
think
that
the
delli
paoli
rule
is
improper.
i
think
that
it
is
very
difficult
in
a
joint
trial
in
the
federal
court
where
you
represent
an
individual
that
he
has
made
no
admission
and
you
expect
that
you
--
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
that's
correct
and
--
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
well,
if
it
--
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
no.
if
all
we
had
is
the
admission
of
evans
that
he
--
evans
perpetrated
the
robbery
then
i
would
have
--
no
complaint.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
that's
correct
and
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
that
is
true
and
in
this
factual
situation
indeed
--
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
it
is
necessary
in
this
factual
situation
because
i
think
the
case
here
is
weak.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
i'm
quite
sure
that
they
are
highly
important
in
other
situation.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
case
can
be
distinguished
from
delli
paoli--
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
i
think
that
a
defendant
in
the
role
that
bruton
had
here
is
not
sufficiently
protected
by
an
instruction
or
the
instructions
that
this
court
had
given
which
are
--
were
not
objected
to
and
are
proper.
i
think
that
it
is
impossible
to
remove
the
prejudice
in
the
trial
of
the
case
and
i
think
it
is
recognized
best,
not
necessarily
by
lawyers
and
judges
but
by
bruton
himself
when
i
explained
to
him
his
rights
of
appeal
in
forma
pauperis
and
he
said,
i
would
like
a
new
trial
rather
than
serve
for
25
years
obviously.
but
he
said,
if
the
next
trial
is
with
evidence,
he
said
forget
it
because
he
felt
of
course
the
admission
was
damning.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
no.
in
the
brief,
they
say
that
it's
the
solicitor
general
points
out
the
rule
in
delli
paoli
is
good,
but
this
case
places
too
much
strain
upon
it.
i
came
here
of
course
representing
george
william
bruton
and
seeking
for
him
a
new
trial
but
i
don't
think
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
rule
in
delli
paoli
is
correct.
i
don't
think
--
i
think
it
places
far
too
great
of
burden
upon
12
individuals
tried
and
true,
if
they
were
to
give
you
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
if
they
are
exposed
an
admission
of
a
co-defendant.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
yes.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
yes.
that's
correct.
the
bozza
case
or
of
course
each
of
those
case
are
cited
in
my
brief
but
certainly
had
the
eight
circuit
been
of
the
same
persuasion
as
the
author
of
the
bozza
opinion,
i
doubt
that
we
would
not
be
here.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
that
is
correct.
the
matter
was
not
argued
as
a
matter
of
fact
before
the
eight
circuit.
it
was
the
eight
circuit
first
opportunity
to
review
the
miranda
holdings
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
had
briefed
that
portion
of
the
case
and
of
course
had
the
decision
reversed
for
the
wrong
client
is
the
best
that
i
could
gather
as
far
as
bruton
is
concerned.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
it
was
in
greenwell
and
--
but
not
in
bozza.
i
think
that
this
is
a
stronger
situation
of
then
certainly
then
in
the
bozza
decision
because
there,
it
was
an
admission
that
gave
devastating
corroboration
to
the
testimony
of
an
accomplice.
here,
i
think
this
is
a
stronger
situation.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
daniel
p.
reardon,
jr.
i
have
nothing
further.
