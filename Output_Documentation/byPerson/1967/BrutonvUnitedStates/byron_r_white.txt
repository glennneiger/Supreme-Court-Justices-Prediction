this
is

your

you
wouldn't

justice

if
evans'
confession

mentioned
your

why
evans'
reversal

be
a
ground

the
reason
for
requiring
the
court
to

to
use
this

that
hearsay

admissible
against

i
don't

why
you

indeed
that
any
case

would
suppose
you
would
say
that
the
rule
ought
to
apply
to
all
instances
where
objectionable
hearsay
is

the
jury?
justice

you

you
don't

you
think
this
