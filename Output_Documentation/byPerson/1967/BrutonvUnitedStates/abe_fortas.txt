justice
abe
fortas
well,
actually
this
is
arguably
anyway
a
stronger
case
for
reversal
than
greenwell
and
bozza
and
so
on
because
here,
you
have
the
fact
which
is
not
present
in
the
other
cases
that
the
confession
was
held
inadmissible
on
the
appeal
and
was
in
greenwell?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
would
like
to
see
what
i
quite
understand
your
position.
let's
take
a
case
where
a
confession
of
one
co-defendant
is
admitted
in
a
--
at
a
trial
and
that
confession
names
the
other
co-defendant
and
involves
him,
identifies
him
as
a
participant
in
the
crime.
now,
would
you
say
that
that
standing
alone
is
or
is
not
objectionable?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
objectionable
in
a
technical
sense.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
is
this?
is
this
a
kind
of
a
no
prejudicial
error
rule
that
you're
talking
about
or
totality
of
the
circumstances
or
what
do
we
look
at?
justice
abe
fortas
a
trial
judge
may
not
know
until
a
whole
--
until
all
of
the
evidence
is
in
whether
he
did
the
right
thing
or
didn't
do
the
right
thing
in
permitting
this
confession
to
--
in
permitting
the
trial
to
go
forward
with
the
--
without
severance
in
view
of
the
use
of
the
confession.
he
won't
know
that
until
the
very
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
forgive
me
for
asking
you
to
take
your
time
to
ask
you
one
more
question.
is
there
any
information
as
to
how
frequent
this
is
that
is
to
say,
let's
take
--
you
mentioned
the
17
defendants
in
philadelphia
and
mississippi
but
that
did
not
involved
any
confession
problem,
did
it?
justice
abe
fortas
oh
it
did?
do
we
have
any
information
or
is
any
information
available
as
to
how
frequently
trials
of
more
than
one
defendants
involve
the
use
of
confessions?
justice
abe
fortas
of
course,
that's
kind
of
the
key
question
i
think
because
at
least
in
terms
of
an
assessment
of
this
problem
because
if
we're
talking
about
most
trial
when
we
confront
the
confession
problem,
we're
talking
about
most
trials
in
which
there
are
co-defendants
that's
one
thing
if
we're
talking
about
a
small
percentage
of
them
that's
another
thing.
justice
abe
fortas
i
said
that
you
have
been
talking
logically.
justice
abe
fortas
because
if
you
want
to
take
this
up
logically,
i
think
we're
going
to
have
to
unwind
the
great
deal
of
your
argument?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
is
your
position
here.
you're
saying
that
in
this
particular
case
instruction
disregard
the
confession
is
not
enough.
precisely,
your
submission
to
the
fact
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes
but
in
all
of
the
circumstances,
this
is
the
key
operative
point.
you
are
saying
that
where
all
of
the
circumstances
were
in
it,
we
may
discount
the
potential
effectiveness
of
this
kind
of
instruction
of
the
jury.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
actually
this
is
arguably
anyway
a
stronger
case
for
reversal
than
greenwell
and
bozza
and
so
on
because
here,
you
