mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
my
situation
here
is
a
somewhat
unusual
one.
i
join
with
mr.
reardon
in
seeking
a
reversal
of
the
judgment
below.
my
objective,
however,
is
to
do
what
i
can
to
make
sure
that
that
be
on
what
i
regard
is
the
proper
ground
and
somewhat
narrow
one
and
not
on
the
broader
ground
in
which
has
been
suggested
by
the
bench
though
it
was
not
included
in
the
petitioner's
brief
that
delli
paoli
be
overruled.
we
believe
that
the
delli
paoli
rule
is
a
sound
one
and
we
understand
the
delli
paoli
rule
to
be
simply
that.
there
is
no
requirement
that
there
always
be
a
separate
trial
when
several
persons
are
indicted
and
sought
to
be
tried
at
the
same
time.
each
case
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
at
least
one
of
them
has
confessed.
i
would
put
that
in,
in
order
to
narrow
it
to
the
particular
circumstance.
i
would
point
out
that
as
recently
as
two
years
ago,
the
court
amended
the
rules
of
this
court,
rule
8
which
allows
joint
trials.
these
are
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
and
it
was
not
amended.
rule
14
which
provides
for
motions
for
separate
trials
was
amended
by
adding
a
paragraph
or
adding
a
sentence
which
reads
in
ruling
on
a
motion
by
a
defendant
for
severance,
the
court
may
order
the
attorney
for
the
government
to
deliver
to
the
court
for
inspection
in
camera
any
statements
or
confessions
made
by
the
defendants
which
the
government
intends
to
introduce
in
evidence
at
the
trial.
as
of
that
time,
the
court
did
not
see
fit
to
change
the
rule
so
as
to
provide
that
there
must
be
separate
trials
if
there
is
a
confession
by
one
defendant.
we
recognize
of
course
that
the
application
of
the
rule
of
delli
paoli
is
a
matter
of
some
difficulty
and
that
it
is
addressed
to
the
sound
judgment
and
discretion
of
the
district
judge.
we
think
that
in
this
case
under
the
circumstances
as
they
have
finally
worked
out,
that
it
is
not
appropriate
to
seek
to
support
the
conviction
of
bruton
obtained
in
this
case.
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
for
that.
one
is
the
fact
that
the
other
evidence
against
bruton
was
rather
slim.
he
was
not
identified
by
one
of
the
witnesses
who
did
identify
evans.
he
was
identified
by
another
witness,
but
that
witness
had
failed
to
identify
him
in
a
lineup
some
months
before
he
was
arrested
and
there
are
some
aspects
of
the
testimony
of
that
witness
which
lead
one
to
think
that
the
suggestion
which
came
from
seeing
him
in
custody
may
have
had
some
unconscious
i
am
sure
influence
on
her
testimony.
we
have
then
the
fact
that
the
confession
of
evans
was
held
to
be
inadmissible
as
to
him,
a
factor
which
was
not
present
in
delli
paoli
and
which
i
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
agree
that
logically,
it
makes
no
difference.
i
think
that
we
are
in
an
area
where
maybe
logic
chopping
may
not
be
exactly
what
should
be
done.
and
when
i
add
to
all
of
this,
the
fact
that
thereafter
evans
was
retried
and
this
was
not
known
when
the
government's
brief
in
opposition
was
filed
in
this
case,
evans
was
thereafter
retried
and
on
the
evidence
which
was
available
against
him
without
the
confession
he
was
acquitted
and
at
this
point
which
is
the
point
when
i
first
came
to
consider
the
case,
i
found
that
more
than
i
felt
i
could
conscientiously
undertake
to
do
to
say
that
pure
logic
must
prevail.
we
must
go
through
this
confession.
it
could
not
of
that
any
bearing
with
respect
to
bruton
and
though
his
co-defendant
is
now
completely
discharged
from
this
offense,
nevertheless
the
conviction
against
bruton
must
stand.
what
i
would
have
felt
if
the
evidence
against
bruton
had
been
really
strong,
if
there
had
been
numerous
eyewitnesses
and
fingerprints
and
an
article
of
his
clothing
had
been
found
at
the
scene
or
something
like
that,
i
do
not
know.
it
is
an
element
in
my
thought
here
that
the
other
evidence
against
bruton
was
in
this
case
rather
slim.
i
know
that
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
reviewed
that
evidence
and
found
it
sufficient,
but
they
did
point
out
in
a
footnote
in
their
opinion
that
in
making
that
review,
they
took
it
most
strongly
in
favor
of
the
government
and
it
is
not
clear
to
me
that
that
is
an
appropriate
way
to
deal
with
that
evidence
in
the
particular
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
expedience
in
the
prosecution
of
cases?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
that
it
is
just
a
matter
of
expediency
in
getting
confessions,
in
getting
convictions
which
leads
to
the
desirability
of
trying
a
number
of
people
at
once.
in
my
preparation
for
this
case,
i
have
gotten
out
the
brief
which
the
government
filed
in
the
delli
paoli
case.
perhaps
we
should
have
reprinted
it
for
this
purpose,
but
as
there
was
no
suggestion
in
the
petitioner's
brief
that
delli
paoli
should
be
overruled,
i
did
not
think
it
appropriate
for
us
to
face
a
full
dress
reconsideration
of
delli
paoli.
but
i
would
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
brief
which
was
filed
in
that
case
and
which
of
course
is
available
in
the
court's
records,
number
33
in
the
1956
term
and
i
note
among
other
things
that
the
government
did
not
dare
call
for
any
fixed
or
absolute
rule
that
there
can
always
be
joint
trials
in
cases
like
this.
all
it
sought
was
that
there
should
not
be
a
fixed
and
absolute
rule
that
there
cannot
be
joint
trials
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
number
33
in
1956
term.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
delli
paoli.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
far
as
i
understand
it,
the
counsel
for
any
defendant
can
also
ask
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
in
some
cases,
i
think
that
is
possible.
i
may
say
that
that
is
another
element
in
this
particular
case
as
i
mentioned
in
our
brief.
it
would
have
been
easy
here
with
proper
forethought
and
foresight
to
have
instructed
this
post
office
inspector
now
because
you
will
recall
this
was
an
oral
confession.
now,
when
you
recite
this
confession,
talk
only
about
evans
and
don't
say
anything
about
bruton.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
bruton
is
only
mentioned
only
once
in
the
second
of
the
two
statements
and
i
wonder
where
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
why
counsel
thought
it's
necessary
or
desirable
to
bring
in
the
second
interview.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
could
have
been
done
here.
there
are
other
cases
of
which
i
think
delli
paoli
was
one
where
the
reference
to
the
other
persons
is
so
interwoven
into
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
its
--
mr.
justice,
i
think
it's
more
complicated.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
the
brief
in
the
delli
paoli
case,
the
government
said
that
such
trials
remain
a
proper
and
necessary
measure
of
counteracting
the
equally
serious
problems
intrinsic,
in
separate
and
successive
trials
of
joint
defendants.
now,
in
the
first
place,
you
can
have
cases
with
a
large
number
of
defendants.
we
have
recently
had
a
trial
which
is
well
known
and
i
will
only
refer
to
it
as
17
defendants
in
philadelphia
and
mississippi.
it
seems
a
little
odd
to
think
that
that
should
have
been
17
separate
trials.
even
if
you're
dealing
only
with
four
or
five
persons,
the
risk
that
if
you
have
to
have
separate
trials
that
reports
of
it
will
get
into
the
newspapers
and
that
the
jurors
in
the
second
and
third
and
fourth
trial
will
have
heard
various
things
which
have
happened
at
the
first
trial
of
such
that
risk
is
very
serious.
a
conscientious
prosecutor
might
well
feel
that
in
fairness
to
all
the
defendants,
they
must
be
tried
once
and
not
segregate
them.
you
can
say
oh
well
changes
of
venue
and
delays
of
nine
months
between
the
trial
would
take
care
of
it,
but
five
times
nine
months
spreads
it
over
three
years
which
doesn't
sound
like
a
very
sensible
way.
then
there's
a
--
before
i
come
to
the
most
important
one,
there
is
simply
a
matter
of
extents
to
the
defendants,
the
persons
who
are
tried
fourth
and
fifth
or
sixteenth
or
seventeenth
will
have
to
monitor
and
observe
each
of
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
agree
mr.
justice.
i
wish
they
hadn't
brought
it
in.
i
think
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
know
that
it
is
easy
in
my
position
to
second
guess
the
man
who
were
on
the
firing
line.
i
can
understand
the
desire
to
make
available
all
the
evidence
you
have.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
standing
alone
is
not
sufficient
to
warrant
a
new
trial.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
change
your
question
a
little
bit.
you
said
objectionable
and
i
confess
or
i
concede
that
it
raises
intellectual
problems.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
think
that
that
alone
without
further
facts
which
show
that
on
balance,
this
had
an
appreciable
effect
in
the
conclusion
reached
in
the
trial
that
it
should
be
sufficient
to
establish
a
new
trial.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
mr.
justice
that
it
may
be
analogous
to
the
no
prejudicial
error
rule
which
i
think
if
you
look
at
it,
it's
logically
hard
to
defend
in
a
particular
case.
you
can
prove
that
this
wasn't
the
thing
that
finally
put
it
across
in
the
jury's
mind.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
the
prosecutor
may
not
know
that
either.
witnesses
don't
always
turn
out
to
say
what
he
hopes
or
thinks
they
will
and
until
everything
is
in,
he
is
in
no
position
finally
to
evaluate
whether
this
should
have
been
done.
now,
i
have
held
out
to
the
last
what
seems
to
me
to
be
the
most
serious
problem
in
this
matter.
if
joint
defendants
in
this
situation
must
be
tried
separately,
there
will
be
a
great
deal
of
objecting
among
the
parties
among
to
who
is
to
be
tried
first.
the
defendant
who
has
confessed
might
well
think,
well,
i
ought
to
be
tried
first
and
very
likely,
i
will
be
convicted
because
of
the
confession.
there's
no
objection
to
the
use
of
the
confession
in
my
case
and
the
ordinary
case
which
doesn't
have
the
miranda
and
other
aspects
that
this
particular
one
had.
now
then
if
i
am
convicted
which
is
very
likely
to
happen
and
then
i
can
talk
with
the
prosecutor
about
testifying
in
the
following
trials
and
they
may
not
make
any
bargain
with
me,
but
it
might
just
turn
out
that
i
would
come
out
better.
i
might
even
be
able
to
get
the
judge
to
differ
sentencing
until
all
of
the
cases
had
been
tried.
let
me
point
out
that
in
this
very
case
when
--
if
as
and
when
this
case
goes
back
to
be
retried
as
to
bruton,
evans
is
as
far
as
i
can
see
available
as
a
witness
in
the
trial
of
bruton.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
compellable
to
testify,
he
has
been
acquitted.
he
has
no
privilege
against
self
incrimination
with
respect
to
this
case.
from
all
that
we
know,
he
was
an
eyewitness
of
the
transaction
and
he
and
ms.
miller
together
should
be
an
ample
evidence
to
persuade
the
jury
in
the
next
trial.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe
it
did
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
no
such
information
mr.
justice.
my
experience
over
the
past
four
months
would
lead
me
to
think
that
there
are
many
great
joint
trials.
i
do
not
know
how
many
of
them
involved
the
use
of
confessions
which
are
admissible
against
one
and
not
against
another,
confessions
or
statements
made
during
the
course
of
the
conspiracy
are
admissible
against
all
defendants.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
may
i
say
mr.
justice.
logically
i
don't
see
that
it
makes
any
difference.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
appreciate
that.
i
think
that
this
is
a
very
practical
question
in
which
conceptions
of
fairness
and
expediency
and
by
expediency
i
mean
not
only
to
the
government
but
also
to
the
defendants
and
to
the
courts
are
-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
agree.
on
the
other
hand,
if
we
take
this
up
logically
then
the
conviction
or
the
judgment
sustaining
bruton's
conviction
apparently
should
be
affirmed,
a
result
that
i
have
not
felt
that
i
could
urge
upon
this
court.
my
impression
would
be
but
i
have
no
facts
that
this
not
happen
very
often,
but
that
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
not
a
rare
thing
which
happens
only
extremely
occasionally.
i
think
it
happens
often
enough
to
be
a
significant
matter
and
when
it
does
happen
however,
all
of
the
other
facts
differ.
i
think
if
we
get
a
case
as
delli
paoli
was
where
the
other
evidence
against
the
defendant
named
was
overwhelming
where
the
evidence
was
presented
quite
separately
with
very
specific
instructions
by
the
court
at
the
time
it
was
presented
and
also
in
the
chart
that
there
is
much
to
be
said
for
the
result
which
was
actually
reached
in
the
delli
paoli
case.
and
let
me
point
out
too
that
if
the
court
starts
down
the
road
of
saying
that
instructions
are
not
enough,
juries
simply
cannot
keep
these
things
separated
and
act
in
accordance
with
the
instructions
that
a
good
many
other
problems
will
arise.
that
would
seem
to
me
and
i
think
that
any
evidence
that
got
into
the
record
that
was
inadmissible,
any
hearsay
which
the
witness
blurted
out
and
the
court
stopped
the
witness
and
then
instructed
the
jury
who
will
disregard
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
i
am
saying
that
in
all
of
the
circumstances
of
this
case
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
trying
to
say
mr.
justice
that
even
though
such
an
instruction
is
given,
it
may
not
be
enough
in
the
actual
facts
to
satisfy
the
court
that
the
instruction
was
actually
effective.
i
am
trying
to
suggest
that
it
would
be
unfortunate
to
have
a
rule
that
never
could
hand
instruction
be
effective
to
cancel
out
negative
make
irrelevant
the
admission
of
inappropriate
or
inadmissible
evidence.
we
have
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice
except
in
terms
of
the
usual
function
which
courts
performed
in
criminal
and
in
civil
cases
of
overlooking
the
whole
transaction
and
trying
to
see
that
justice
has
been
done.
in
this
case
as
i
have
said,
the
other
evidence
is
thin.
the
other
defendant
has
been
tried
again
and
he
has
been
acquitted
and
at
that
point,
i
find
myself
on
two
slender
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
that
you
could
have
had
a
case
that
even
if
i
could
see
the
writing
of
an
opinion
in
this
case
that
even
if
the
evidence
against
evans
had
been
admissible
that
there
should
have
been
a
reversal
against
bruton
on
the
ground
that
the
other
evidence
against
him
was
slim
and
under
the
delli
paoli
rule
the
reference
to
bruton
on
the
whole
was
one
which
should
not
have
been
allowed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that's
a
kind
of
dilemma.
that's
the
dilemma
which
you
get
into
with
respect
to
the
failure
of
the
defendant
to
testify
or
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
and
if
we
carry
that
out
to
its
logical
extreme,
it's
impossible
to
try
anyone
which
i
had
not
suppose
was
--
what
we
were
coming
to.
at
any
rate
in
this
case,
when
evans
is
not
only
reversed
but
is
retried
and
acquitted.
when
the
other
evidence
with
respect
to
bruton,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
very
thin
recognizing
fully
that
the
matter
is
for
the
decision
by
this
court
that
confession
of
error
is
in
no
sense
binding
on
the
court,
but
also
having
my
own
responsibility
to
perform
here.
i
have
concluded
that
our
duty
is
to
recommend
to
the
court
that
this
judgment
should
be
reversed
and
a
new
trial
granted,
but
i
would
urge
that
it
not
be
on
the
ground
that
the
appellee
should
be
overruled.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
my
situation
here
is
a
somewhat
unusual
one.
i
join
with
mr.
reardon
in
seeking
a
reversal
of
the
judgment
below.
my
objective,
however,
is
to
do
what
i
can
to
make
sure
that
that
be
on
what
i
regard
is
the
proper
ground
and
somewhat
narrow
one
and
not
on
the
broader
ground
in
which
has
been
suggested
by
the
bench
though
it
was
not
included
in
the
petitioner's
brief
that
delli
paoli
be
overruled.
we
believe
that
the
delli
paoli
rule
is
a
sound
one
and
we
understand
the
delli
paoli
rule
to
be
simply
that.
there
is
no
requirement
that
there
always
be
a
separate
trial
when
several
persons
are
indicted
and
sought
to
be
tried
at
the
same
time.
each
case
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
at
least
one
of
them
has
confessed.
i
would
put
that
in,
in
order
to
narrow
it
to
the
particular
circumstance.
i
would
point
out
that
as
recently
as
two
years
ago,
the
court
amended
the
rules
of
this
court,
rule
8
which
allows
joint
trials.
these
are
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
and
it
was
not
amended.
rule
14
which
provides
for
motions
for
separate
trials
was
amended
by
adding
a
paragraph
or
adding
a
sentence
which
reads
in
ruling
on
a
motion
by
a
defendant
for
severance,
the
court
may
order
the
attorney
for
the
government
to
deliver
to
the
court
for
inspection
in
camera
any
statements
or
confessions
made
by
the
defendants
which
the
government
intends
to
introduce
in
evidence
at
the
trial.
as
of
that
time,
the
court
did
not
see
fit
to
change
the
rule
so
as
to
provide
that
there
must
be
separate
trials
if
there
is
a
confession
by
one
defendant.
we
recognize
of
course
that
the
application
of
the
rule
of
delli
paoli
is
a
matter
of
some
difficulty
and
that
it
is
addressed
to
the
sound
judgment
and
discretion
of
the
district
judge.
we
think
that
in
this
case
under
the
circumstances
as
they
have
finally
worked
out,
that
it
is
not
appropriate
to
seek
to
support
the
conviction
of
bruton
obtained
in
this
case.
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
for
that.
one
is
the
fact
that
the
other
evidence
against
bruton
was
rather
slim.
he
was
not
identified
by
one
of
the
witnesses
who
did
identify
evans.
he
was
identified
by
another
witness,
but
that
witness
had
failed
to
identify
him
in
a
lineup
some
months
before
he
was
arrested
and
there
are
some
aspects
of
the
testimony
of
that
witness
which
lead
one
to
think
that
the
suggestion
which
came
from
seeing
him
in
custody
may
have
had
some
unconscious
i
am
sure
influence
on
her
testimony.
we
have
then
the
fact
that
the
confession
of
evans
was
held
to
be
inadmissible
as
to
him,
a
factor
which
was
not
present
in
delli
paoli
and
which
i
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
agree
that
logically,
it
makes
no
difference.
i
think
that
we
are
in
an
area
where
maybe
logic
chopping
may
not
be
exactly
what
should
be
done.
and
when
i
add
to
all
of
this,
the
fact
that
thereafter
evans
was
retried
and
this
was
not
known
when
the
government's
brief
in
opposition
was
filed
in
this
case,
evans
was
thereafter
retried
and
on
the
evidence
which
was
available
against
him
without
the
confession
he
was
acquitted
and
at
this
point
which
is
the
point
when
i
first
came
to
consider
the
case,
i
found
that
more
than
i
felt
i
could
conscientiously
undertake
to
do
to
say
that
pure
logic
must
prevail.
we
must
go
through
this
confession.
it
could
not
of
that
any
bearing
with
respect
to
bruton
and
though
his
co-defendant
is
now
completely
discharged
from
this
offense,
nevertheless
the
conviction
against
bruton
must
stand.
what
i
would
have
felt
if
the
evidence
against
bruton
had
been
really
strong,
if
there
had
been
numerous
eyewitnesses
and
fingerprints
and
an
article
of
his
clothing
had
been
found
at
the
scene
or
something
like
that,
i
do
not
know.
it
is
an
element
in
my
thought
here
that
the
other
evidence
against
bruton
was
in
this
case
rather
slim.
i
know
that
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
reviewed
that
evidence
and
found
it
sufficient,
but
they
did
point
out
in
a
footnote
in
their
opinion
that
in
making
that
review,
they
took
it
most
strongly
in
favor
of
the
government
and
it
is
not
clear
to
me
that
that
is
an
appropriate
way
to
deal
with
that
evidence
in
the
particular
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
expedience
in
the
prosecution
of
cases?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
that
it
is
just
a
matter
of
expediency
in
getting
confessions,
in
getting
convictions
which
leads
to
the
desirability
of
trying
a
number
of
people
at
once.
in
my
preparation
for
this
case,
i
have
gotten
out
the
brief
which
the
government
filed
in
the
delli
paoli
case.
perhaps
we
should
have
reprinted
it
for
this
purpose,
but
as
there
was
no
suggestion
in
the
petitioner's
brief
that
delli
paoli
should
be
overruled,
i
did
not
think
it
appropriate
for
us
to
face
a
full
dress
reconsideration
of
delli
paoli.
but
i
would
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
brief
which
was
filed
in
that
case
and
which
of
course
is
available
in
the
court's
records,
number
33
in
the
1956
term
and
i
note
among
other
things
that
the
government
did
not
dare
call
for
any
fixed
or
absolute
rule
that
there
can
always
be
joint
trials
in
cases
like
this.
all
it
sought
was
that
there
should
not
be
a
fixed
and
absolute
rule
that
there
cannot
be
joint
trials
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
number
33
in
1956
term.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
delli
paoli.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
far
as
i
understand
it,
the
counsel
for
any
defendant
can
also
ask
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
in
some
cases,
i
think
that
is
possible.
i
may
say
that
that
is
another
element
in
this
particular
case
as
i
mentioned
in
our
brief.
it
would
have
been
easy
here
with
proper
forethought
and
foresight
to
have
instructed
this
post
office
inspector
now
because
you
will
recall
this
was
an
oral
confession.
now,
when
you
recite
this
confession,
talk
only
about
evans
and
don't
say
anything
about
bruton.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
bruton
is
only
mentioned
only
once
in
the
second
of
the
two
statements
and
i
wonder
where
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
why
counsel
thought
it's
necessary
or
desirable
to
bring
in
the
second
interview.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
could
have
been
done
here.
there
are
other
cases
of
which
i
think
delli
paoli
was
one
where
the
reference
to
the
other
persons
is
so
interwoven
into
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
its
--
mr.
justice,
i
think
it's
more
complicated.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
the
brief
in
the
delli
paoli
case,
the
government
said
that
such
trials
remain
a
proper
and
necessary
measure
of
counteracting
the
equally
serious
problems
intrinsic,
in
separate
and
successive
trials
of
joint
defendants.
now,
in
the
first
place,
you
can
have
cases
with
a
large
number
of
defendants.
we
have
recently
had
a
trial
which
is
well
known
and
i
will
only
refer
to
it
as
17
defendants
in
philadelphia
and
mississippi.
it
seems
a
little
odd
to
think
that
that
should
have
been
17
separate
trials.
even
if
you're
dealing
only
with
four
or
five
persons,
the
risk
that
if
you
have
to
have
separate
trials
that
reports
of
it
will
get
into
the
newspapers
and
that
the
jurors
in
the
second
and
third
and
fourth
trial
will
have
heard
various
things
which
have
happened
at
the
first
trial
of
such
that
risk
is
very
serious.
a
conscientious
prosecutor
might
well
feel
that
in
fairness
to
all
the
defendants,
they
must
be
tried
once
and
not
segregate
them.
you
can
say
oh
well
changes
of
venue
and
delays
of
nine
months
between
the
trial
would
take
care
of
it,
but
five
times
nine
months
spreads
it
over
three
years
which
doesn't
sound
like
a
very
sensible
way.
then
there's
a
--
before
i
come
to
the
most
important
one,
there
is
simply
a
matter
of
extents
to
the
defendants,
the
persons
who
are
tried
fourth
and
fifth
or
sixteenth
or
seventeenth
will
have
to
monitor
and
observe
each
of
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
agree
mr.
justice.
i
wish
they
hadn't
brought
it
in.
i
think
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
know
that
it
is
easy
in
my
position
to
second
guess
the
man
who
were
on
the
firing
line.
i
can
understand
the
desire
to
make
available
all
the
evidence
you
have.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
standing
alone
is
not
sufficient
to
warrant
a
new
trial.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
change
your
question
a
little
bit.
you
said
objectionable
and
i
confess
or
i
concede
that
it
raises
intellectual
problems.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
think
that
that
alone
without
further
facts
which
show
that
on
balance,
this
had
an
appreciable
effect
in
the
conclusion
reached
in
the
trial
that
it
should
be
sufficient
to
establish
a
new
trial.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
mr.
justice
that
it
may
be
analogous
to
the
no
prejudicial
error
rule
which
i
think
if
you
look
at
it,
it's
logically
hard
to
defend
in
a
particular
case.
you
can
prove
that
this
wasn't
the
thing
that
finally
put
it
across
in
the
jury's
mind.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
the
prosecutor
may
not
know
that
either.
witnesses
don't
always
turn
out
to
say
what
he
hopes
or
thinks
they
will
and
until
everything
is
in,
he
is
in
no
position
finally
to
evaluate
whether
this
should
have
been
done.
now,
i
have
held
out
to
the
last
what
seems
to
me
to
be
the
most
serious
problem
in
this
matter.
if
joint
defendants
in
this
situation
must
be
tried
separately,
there
will
be
a
great
deal
of
objecting
among
the
parties
among
to
who
is
to
be
tried
first.
the
defendant
who
has
confessed
might
well
think,
well,
i
ought
to
be
tried
first
and
very
likely,
i
will
be
convicted
because
of
the
confession.
there's
no
objection
to
the
use
of
the
confession
in
my
case
and
the
ordinary
case
which
doesn't
have
the
miranda
and
other
aspects
that
this
particular
one
had.
now
then
if
i
am
convicted
which
is
very
likely
to
happen
and
then
i
can
talk
with
the
prosecutor
about
testifying
in
the
following
trials
and
they
may
not
make
any
bargain
with
me,
but
it
might
just
turn
out
that
i
would
come
out
better.
i
might
even
be
able
to
get
the
judge
to
differ
sentencing
until
all
of
the
cases
had
been
tried.
let
me
point
out
that
in
this
very
case
when
--
if
as
and
when
this
case
goes
back
to
be
retried
as
to
bruton,
evans
is
as
far
as
i
can
see
available
as
a
witness
in
the
trial
of
bruton.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
compellable
to
testify,
he
has
been
acquitted.
he
has
no
privilege
against
self
incrimination
with
respect
to
this
case.
from
all
that
we
know,
he
was
an
eyewitness
of
the
transaction
and
he
and
ms.
miller
together
should
be
an
ample
evidence
to
persuade
the
jury
in
the
next
trial.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe
it
did
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
no
such
information
mr.
justice.
my
experience
over
the
past
four
months
would
lead
me
to
think
that
there
are
many
great
joint
trials.
i
do
not
know
how
many
of
them
involved
the
use
of
confessions
which
are
admissible
against
one
and
not
against
another,
confessions
or
statements
made
during
the
course
of
the
conspiracy
are
admissible
against
all
defendants.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
may
i
say
mr.
justice.
logically
i
don't
see
that
it
makes
any
difference.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
appreciate
that.
i
think
that
this
is
a
very
practical
question
in
which
conceptions
of
fairness
and
expediency
and
by
expediency
i
mean
not
only
to
the
government
but
also
to
the
defendants
and
to
the
courts
are
-
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
agree.
on
the
other
hand,
if
we
take
this
up
logically
then
the
conviction
or
the
judgment
sustaining
bruton's
conviction
apparently
should
be
affirmed,
a
result
that
i
have
not
felt
that
i
could
urge
upon
this
court.
my
impression
would
be
but
i
have
no
facts
that
this
not
happen
very
often,
but
that
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
not
a
rare
thing
which
happens
only
extremely
occasionally.
i
think
it
happens
often
enough
to
be
a
significant
matter
and
when
it
does
happen
however,
all
of
the
other
facts
differ.
i
think
if
we
get
a
case
as
delli
paoli
was
where
the
other
evidence
against
the
defendant
named
was
overwhelming
where
the
evidence
was
presented
quite
separately
with
very
specific
instructions
by
the
court
at
the
time
it
was
presented
and
also
in
the
chart
that
there
is
much
to
be
said
for
the
result
which
was
actually
reached
in
the
delli
paoli
case.
and
let
me
point
out
too
that
if
the
court
starts
down
the
road
of
saying
that
instructions
are
not
enough,
juries
simply
cannot
keep
these
things
separated
and
act
in
accordance
with
the
instructions
that
a
good
many
other
problems
will
arise.
that
would
seem
to
me
and
i
think
that
any
evidence
that
got
into
the
record
that
was
inadmissible,
any
hearsay
which
the
witness
blurted
out
and
the
court
stopped
the
witness
and
then
instructed
the
jury
who
will
disregard
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice,
i
am
saying
that
in
all
of
the
circumstances
of
this
case
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
trying
to
say
mr.
justice
that
even
though
such
an
instruction
is
given,
it
may
not
be
enough
in
the
actual
facts
to
satisfy
the
court
that
the
instruction
was
actually
effective.
i
am
trying
to
suggest
that
it
would
be
unfortunate
to
have
a
rule
that
never
could
hand
instruction
be
effective
to
cancel
out
negative
make
irrelevant
the
admission
of
inappropriate
or
inadmissible
evidence.
we
have
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice
except
in
terms
of
the
usual
function
which
courts
performed
in
criminal
and
in
civil
cases
of
overlooking
the
whole
transaction
and
trying
to
see
that
justice
has
been
done.
in
this
case
as
i
have
said,
the
other
evidence
is
thin.
the
other
defendant
has
been
tried
again
and
he
has
been
acquitted
and
at
that
point,
i
find
myself
on
two
slender
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
that
you
could
have
had
a
case
that
even
if
i
could
see
the
writing
of
an
opinion
in
this
case
that
even
if
the
evidence
against
evans
had
been
admissible
that
there
should
have
been
a
reversal
against
bruton
on
the
ground
that
the
other
evidence
against
him
was
slim
and
under
the
delli
paoli
rule
the
reference
to
bruton
on
the
whole
was
one
which
should
not
have
been
allowed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that's
a
kind
of
dilemma.
that's
the
dilemma
which
you
get
into
with
respect
to
the
failure
of
the
defendant
to
testify
or
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
and
if
we
carry
that
out
to
its
logical
extreme,
it's
impossible
to
try
anyone
which
i
had
not
suppose
was
--
what
we
were
coming
to.
at
any
rate
in
this
case,
when
evans
is
not
only
reversed
but
is
retried
and
acquitted.
when
the
other
evidence
with
respect
to
bruton,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
very
thin
recognizing
fully
that
the
matter
is
for
the
decision
by
this
court
that
confession
of
error
is
in
no
sense
binding
on
the
court,
but
also
having
my
own
responsibility
to
perform
here.
i
have
concluded
that
our
duty
is
to
recommend
to
the
court
that
this
judgment
should
be
reversed
and
a
new
trial
granted,
but
i
would
urge
that
it
not
be
on
the
ground
that
the
appellee
should
be
overruled.
