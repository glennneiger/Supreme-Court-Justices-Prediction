justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you're
not
asking
to
overrule
delli?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
the
--
when
you
say
legally
obtained,
it
--
quality,
it's
perfectly
fine
evidence,
isn't
it?
it
resulted
in
a
reversal
only
because
one
of
the
rules
which
is
in
force
through
the
exclusionary
rule
had
been
violated,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
no
question
as
to
your
clients
co-defendant
was
highly
proof
of
evidence
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
his
own
admission.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
that's
why
i'm
asking
you.
if
it
is,
is
it
anymore
or
less
so
or
anymore
so
because
his
co-defendant
obtained
the
reversal
on
the
ground
of
the
evidence,
the
admission
from
him
had
been
illegally
obtained.
i
don't
understand
why
you
just
don't
ask
us
to
overrule
delli
paoli?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
have
difficulty
understanding
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
rather
stopped
at
you
myself
if
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
can
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
can
in
the
sense
that
it
was
held
that
his
own
admission
was
improperly
admitted
against
your
co-defendant
but
i
really
don't
see
how
that
makes
a
distinction
which
would
make
attainable
to
suggest
that
if
we
go
with
you,
that
doesn't
overrule
delli
paoli?
it
seems
to
me
it
must.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
take
it
whether
there
shall
or
shall
not
be
a
joint
trial
is
perhaps
entirely
in
the
discretion
of
the
united
states
attorney,
is
it?
if
the
united
states
attorney
asks
that
there
would
be
severance,
i
gather
ordinarily
a
trial
judge
would
allow
it,
wouldn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
i'm
just
--
and
even
--
surely,
part
of
this
problem
can
be
handled
by
methods
which
don't
require
that
there
would
be
a
severance.
isn't
it
possible
where
the
government
is
going
to
use
a
confession
against
one
which
happens
to
implicate
the
other
by
jank
statute
like
procedures
to
keep
from
the
jury
the
portions
which
implicate
the
co-defendant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
suggest
is
i
don't
see
why
necessarily
overruling
delli
paoli
means
the
end
of
joint
trials.
you
still
have
joint
trials
and
handle
the
prejudice
that
this
kind
of
problem
presents
to
the
mentioned
co-defendant
easily
enough.
you
just
suggested
one
yourself,
it
could
have
been
done
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
may
i
suggest,
i
don't
know
why
that
doesn't
present
to
the
united
states
attorney
then
a
choice,
is
he
going
to
try
them
jointly
if
he
needs
that
confession
so
badly
in
its
complete
form
or
in
that
kind
of
situation
if
he
must
then
ask
for
severance?
i
don't
see
any
difference
about
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
well,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
isn't
this
sometimes
to
mr.
solicitor
general
--
it
seems
to
me
at
least
and
many
of
the
records
that
come
here.
so
often
united
states
attorneys,
i
think
this
maybe
an
instance
over
try
a
case.
what
do
they
need
the
admission
on
this
case
for
it
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
the
rule
is
that
delli
paoli
is
overruled,
i
suggest
that
maybe
we
will
have
to
give
some
more
thought
this
sort.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
probably
compellable,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
to
suggest
perhaps
that
the
mere
comment
itself
against
this
background
of
very
slim
evidence
is
more
likely
you
convict
then
if
nothing
whatever
it
has
been
said
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
judge's
emphasis
on
telling
the
jury
to
forget
it
only
drove
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you're
not
asking
to
overrule
delli?
justice
william
j.
