justice

l.
black
are
you
talking
about
1981
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
1982?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
argument
that
the
law
would
apply
to
missouri
if
missouri
had
laws
--
discrimination
but
that
since
missouri
has
no
laws
in
discriminating,
it
does
not
apply
in
missouri,
is
that
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
operation
of
the
law
depends
then
upon
what
--
what
are
the
laws
of
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
would
seem
to
indicate
to
the
minds
of
some,
they
had
an
idea
that
would
apply
to
those
states
that
had
so-called
black
codes,
but
did
not
apply
to
any
other
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
you're
arguing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
the
law
would
change,
federal
law
would
change
according
to
the
--
what
the
law
in
the
paper?
justice
hugo
l.
black
an
action
under
it
but
it
refers
to
rights?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
that
in
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
inapplicable
to
a
state
that
does
not
have
such
laws?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there'd
be
no
action
but
--
because
there'd
be
no
need
for
action
perhaps?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
change
the
language
which
says
they
shall
have
their
right,
somebody
shall
have
their
right
--
a
citizen
shall
have
the
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
does
it
make
that
ineffective
for
a
state
to
--
if
it
have
laws
which
do
provide
protection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
that's
part
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
section
would
become
inoperative
then.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it's
a
proclamation
of
right
which
is
a
legal
right,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
somebody
has
rights
and
who
is
this
somebody?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
does
this
statute
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
has
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
says
all
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
shall
have
the
same
right
and
who's
they're
talking
about?
is
that
talking
about
a
state
or
citizens
of
a
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
wasn't
this
evidently
intended
to
change
the
law
of
the
state?
wasn't
that
the
very
purpose
of
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
find
that
--
here's
my
trouble
with
your
argument
up
to
this
time.
i
find
nothing
to
indicate
that
this
right
which
was
intended
to
be
concurred
upon
the
circumstance
was
automatically
withdrawn
on
the
passage
of
a
law
by
the
state
just
take
care
of
that
same
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
federal
law
which
is
effective
only
if
the
state
doesn't
have
a
law
of
the
same
kind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
that
congress
can
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
that
congress
has
power
to
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
seems
to
me
like
your
argument
is
really
a
challenge
to
the
power
of
congress
under
the
section
5
of
the
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
seems
to
me
like
that's
the
argument
you
are
making
on
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
while
you
categorize
it
as
an
argument
as
to
what
the
statute
does.
it
seems
to
me
what
you're
saying
is,
we've
got
the
whole
statute
didn't
do
that
because
congress
didn't
have
that
power.
and
for
--
as
for
myself,
i
have
said
they
did
with
reference
to
section
5.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
like
you're
arguing
if
you
could
not
implement
it,
if
you
--
the
legislative
directly
affecting
an
individual
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
you've
got
to
look
to
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
had
so
understood
as
i
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
did
not
understand
about
marsh,
did
you?
i
didn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
say,
you
did
not
understand
about
the
marsh
case,
did
you
as
i
did
not.
that
we
we're
holding
anything
except
the
fourteenth
amendment
didn't
forbid
it
because
there
was
state
action.
but
we
held
was
that
there
were
state
action.
it

it's

justice

black
that's
in
effect
what
we
held,
isn't
it?
justice

the

couldn't
disguise
its
operation
by
letting
it
be
done
by
private
owner
in
his
name.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
did
not
unhold
that
this
was
acting
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
held
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
didn't
forbid
it
because
of
the
nature
of
this
property
which
has
become
to
all
intents
and
purposes
an
incorporated
town
in
alabama
which
was
recognized
as
such
by

of

been

not
even

it

justice

black
--
it
would
apply
to
every
piece
of

property.
justice

of

does
not
answer
your
problems
on

does
it?

yes.

with
the
interpretation
of
