mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
on
a
judgment
which
simply
affirmed
a
holding
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
missouri
dismissing
the
amended
complaint
in
these
actions
for
failure
to
state
the
cause
of
action
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted.
therefore,
the
facts
which
are
well
pleaded
in
the
first
amendment
complaints
set
out
in
the
appendix
are
the
facts
which
we
are
dealing
with.
these
facts
alleged
that
the
respondents,
a
group
of
related
corporations
and
one
individual
or
developers
of
a
subdivision
known
paddock
woods
in
st.
louis
county,
missouri.
they
also
are
developers
of
adjacent
subdivisions
known
as
paddock
estates,
paddock
meadows,
paddock
hills,
and
wedgwood
and
perhaps
some
others.
they
received
permission
from
various
estate
agencies
to
build
these
divisions
including
paddock
woods.
they
layout
the
streets
and
the
sewers
and
the
recreation
facilities
and
various
other
facilities
and
then
they
plot
out
certain
lots
and
they
sell
houses
and
lots
to
the
public.
the
method
of
selling
is
by
buildings
and
display
houses
of
different
types
on
the
--
at
the
location
of
the
subdivision.
and
then
the
public
looks
at
the
display
house
and
the
buyer,
if
he
likes
one
of
the
houses,
will
enter
into
a
contract
by
which
the
respondents
will
build
a
certain
house
according
to
the
choice
of
the
buyer
on
a
certain
lot.
and
when
it's
completed,
the
transfer
of
the
property
is
then
made.
it's
further
alleged
that
the
estate
in
the
various
governmental
subdivisions
of
the
estate
are
involved
with
the
building
of
the
subdivision
both
in
the
approval
and
the
assistance
which
they
give
to
the
builder
and
from
the
standpoint
of
the
function
--
community
functions
which
they
delegate
to
the
builder
with
respect
to
the
government
of
this
community.
the
facts
out
of
this
case
in
particular
arose
from
mr.
and
mrs.
joseph
jones,
the
petitioners
went
out
to
the
subdivision
and
saw
a
house
which
they
wanted
to
buy
and
attempted
buy
it,
and
it
is
alleged
that
the
respondents
refused
to
deal
with
them
or
to
sell
them
a
house
solely
because
mr.
jones
is
a
negro.
the
question
presented
has
led
to
certain
refusal
solely
because
of
the
raise
of
the
prospective
buyer
is
in
violation
of
the
law
of
the
united
states.
in
our
brief,
this
question
took
two
forms,
firstly,
whether
the
conduct
is
prohibited
by
section
1978
of
the
revised
statutes
42
u.s.c.,
section
1982.
secondly,
whether
regardless
of
the
statute
on
the
particular
facts
of
the
case
due
to
the
nature
of
the
subdivision,
the
developer
would
be
barred
from
discriminating
in
excluding
negroes
even
without
a
statute
because
of
the
amount
of
state
action
which
would
be
involved
in
the
building
of
the
subdivision.
also
in
our
brief,
we
broke
down
the
question
concerning
the
statute
into
its
interpretation
and
as
to
whether
if
interpreted
as
barring
this
kind
of
conduct
by
developer
whether
that
would
be
a
constitutional
--
constitutionally
valid
statute.
actually,
it
has
been
conceded
by
the
respondents
that
such
interpretation
would
be
constitutional
and
in
fact
the
court
below,
the
court
of
appeals,
judge
blackmun
held
in
his
opinion
there
was
a
matter
of
interpretation
of
the
statute
rather
than
a
constitutional
question.
so,
addressing
my
first
--
myself
first
to
the
statutory
question
rather
than
the
constitutional
question,
we
think
that
the
statute
by
its
plain
terms
bars
a
builder
of
a
private
subdivision
from
excluding
persons
from
buying
and
living
in
that
subdivision
because
of
their
race.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
your
honor,
that
question
is
not
before
the
court
in
this
case
because
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
in
my
view
of
the
statute,
it
would
apply
to
an
individual
house
owner
as
well
but
of
course
that
and
we
have
here
a
subdivision
developer
in
which
bar
make
it
much
broader
type
of
exclusion
as
it's
pointed
out
in
the
brief
of
united
states.
the
question
concerning
the
interpretation
can
be
looked
at
from
the
standpoint
of
the
history
and
from
a
standpoint
of
what
the
statute
says.
the
history
of
the
statute
is
set
out
at
length
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
respondents
and
there's
more
of
it
set
out
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
united
states
and
in
the
amicus
filed
by
the
group
of
organizations
and
by
the
national
committee
against
discrimination
in
housing.
we
think
that
the
history,
it
shows
abundant
awareness
on
the
part
of
the
drafters
of
this
law
but
it
would
apply
to
individual
action
as
well
as
to
action
only
by
the
state.
the
--
although
there
are
some
mentioned
in
the
debates
concerning
this
law
of
the
problem
of
state
action
looked
at
in
the
historical
standpoint.
i
do
not
think
you
can
interpret
it
as
meaning
that
would
only
cover
state
action.
in
other
words,
the
congress
at
that
time
was
concerned
with
state
action
from
the
standpoint
that
they
have
no
doubt
under
the
accepted
constitutional
doctrine
in
the
mcculloch
versus
maryland
and
prigg
versus
pennsylvania
that
they
can
do
what
they
wished
with
respect
to
controlling
the
conduct
of
individuals
in
violation
of
constitutional
rights.
they
were
concerned
what
would
happen
when
the
individuals
might
have
some
federal
legislation
on
our
position
to
state
legislation
either
permitting
or
in
some
cases
requiring
discriminatory
conduct
and
for
this
reason,
the
debates
did
at
times
focused
on
the
question
of
state
action
and
it
was
resolved
that
the
state
law
would
have
to
give
way
to
the
federal
law.
nevertheless,
there's
very
little
in
the
debates,
there's
very
little
even
in
the
quotations
of
respondent's
brief
on
pages
16
to
19
from
which
you
can
make
the
negative
entrance
because
they
were
covering
what
the
states
might
do,
they
didn't
intend
to
cover
what
individuals
might
do.
the
--
excuse
me.
regardless,
the
--
how
you
that
you
can't
tell
what
was
in
the
mind
of
every
member
of
congress,
the
debate
was
certainly
lengthy
in
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
as
applying
to
individuals
was
brought
out
often
enough
that
we
can
assume
that
the
congress
was
aware
of
the
issue
and
dealt
carefully
in
the
language
which
it
chose
to
adopt
to
say
what
it
meant.
now,
this
statute,
originally
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
is
set
out
in
full
of
the
appendix
of
petitioner's
brief,
and
looking
at
the
language
you
might
know
that
the
first
place
has
entitled
an
act
to
protect
all
persons
in
united
states
in
these
civil
rights
and
furnish
the
means
of
their
vindication.
it's
not
entitled
an
act
to
prevent
the
states
from
discriminating.
it's
a
positively
worded
act
in
its
title
and
in
its
language
itself
which
has
boiled
down
in
section
1982,
it's
just
of
all
citizens
of
the
united
states
shall
have
the
same
right
in
every
state
and
territory
as
is
enjoined
by
white
citizens
thereof
to
inherit
purchase,
lease,
sell,
hold
and
convey
real
and
personal
property.
it
--
the
language
emphasizes
not
the
--
what
the
states
may
not
do
and
doesn't
even
refer
to
that
but
rather
what
the
right
of
an
individual
citizen
who
wishes
to
buy
and
hold
property
is.
furthermore,
it
goes
further
not
even
talking
about
the
right
itself
but
the
enjoyment
of
the
right.
so,
that
it
would
seem
from
the
language
itself
that
we
would
have
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
they
meant
that
this
was
not
meant
to
be
nearly
some
sort
of
negative
restriction
on
what
the
states
or
anyone
else
might
do
but
was
supposed
to
set
forth
the
enjoyment
that
the
right
to
which
people,
particularly
negroes,
have
the
right
to
enjoy.
the
statute
in
question
has
not
received
a
great
deal
of
interpretation
particularly
in
this
court.
in
fact,
the
only
case
that
really
directly
deals
with
these
interpretations
of
the
statute
is
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
morris
which
is
a
district
court
case
and
an
old
case
but
it
upholds
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
what
we
would
give
to
it.
as
far
as
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
statute
has
been
referred
to
collaterally
in
such
cases
of
buchanan
versus
warley
and
oyama
versus
california
but
it
doesn't
mention
any
limiting
aspect
of
the
statute.
and
there
are
some
other
decisions
notably
the
dictum
in
hurd
versus
hodge
which
would
limit
perhaps,
from
which
the
limitation
can
be
implied.
we
feel
that
this
limitation
is
not
--
have
it
by
way
of
dictum
comes
in
conflict
with
the
earlier
cases
dealing
with
the
statute
which
don't
see
any
implication
limiting
the
statute
to
state
action
and
which
do
--
the
fact,
the
earlier
cases
with
respect
to
other
reconstruction
civil
rights
legislation,
almost
all
of
them
refused
to
make
any
such
interpretation
even
though
in
some
cases
it
might
have
saved
the
constitutionality
of
the
law.
furthermore,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
such
implied
limitation
by
hurd
versus
hodge,
we
think
that
it
will
resolve
more
from
a
constitutional
feeling
of
the
court
at
that
time
that
there
was
some
constitutional
limitation
on
the
statute
rather
than
what
the
statute
was
intended.
and
in
the
holdings
of
this
court
in
the
katzenbach
versus
morgan
and
united
states
versus
price
and
the
guest
case,
this
limiting
constitutional
interpretation
of
the
power
of
congress
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
section
5
has
been
abandoned.
so
that
any
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
originally
it
was
enacted
under
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
reenacted
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
yes.
i
was
referring
to
the
force,
if
any,
of
the
dictum
in
hurd
versus
hodge
which
i
think
was
did
perhaps
imply
some
limitation
due
to
fourteenth
amendment
construction
which
i
was
urging
has
been
abandoned
since
that
time
by
this
court
and
in
the
guest
case
and
the
price
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
i
don't
--
it's
our
opinion
that
we
don't
have
to
whether
they
were
really
engaged
in
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
yes.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
i
think
that
that
implication
may
have
been
made
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
think
that
argument
will
be
made
by
the
respondents,
i
think
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
yes,
and
my
answer
to
it
would
be
that
if
congress
had
intended
any
such
repealer,
they
certainly
would've
gone
about
it
in
a
more
direct
way
rather
than
reenacting
the
same
statute
in
the
same
words
verbatim.
a
further
argument
is
made
with
respect
to
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
it
is
argued
in
the
respondent's
brief
that
there
is
no
appropriate
remedy
set
out
for
a
violation
of
a
statute
and
i
think
that
this
--
if
you'll
examine
section
3
of
a
statute
it
clearly
--
section
3
of
the
statute
is
originally
enacted,
it
clearly
envisions
that
remedy
may
be
by
a
civil
suit
and
pursuant
to
the
ordinary
remedies
and
says
to
the
extent
that
where
the
law
has
not
provided
sufficient
remedies,
the
state
common
law
can
furnish
the
necessary
equitable
remedies
as
they
do
in
all
cases
involving
real
property.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
i
think
it's
--
it
becomes
section
1988,
it's
been
rewarded
quite
a
bit
but
this
particular
language
as
to
the
finding
of
the
remedy
under
state
laws
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
--
42
united
states
code,
section
of
1988.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
42.
furthermore,
there
is
real
no
real
difficulty
in
furnishing
a
remedy
and
a
case
like
this
involving
real
property
and
the
courts
of
equity
have
been
doing
this
for
a
long
time
and
compared
to
--
even
the
reapportionment
case
or
school
segregation
case,
the
remedy
is
quite
simple
and
much
within
the
judicial
remedies
and
functions
which
are
traditional.
in
conclusion
with
respect
to
the
statute,
we
feel
that
the
language
is
as
broad
as
can
be
imagined
and
actually
the
opposite
interpretation
was
least
the
majority
free
to
exclude
the
minority
from
any
particular
county
or
portion
of
the
county
or
state
in
the
united
states
and
with
the
effect
that
this
did
have
on
--
it
does
have
on
schools
and
jobs
and
voting.
we
think
that
clearly
that
congress
did
not
mean
that
the
right
to
purchase
housing
or
lease
housing
was
to
be
dependent
upon
the
will
of
the
white
majority
which
at
that
time
after
all
probably
unclosed
to
100%
of
the
property.
turning
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
argument,
we
argue
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case
that
conceding
that
we
might
concede
that
the
statute
did
not
apply
and
still
it
would
have
to
be
a
reversal
of
the
dismissal
of
the
complaint
because
there
are
so
much
state
action
involved
in
the
building
of
a
subdivision
of
this
type
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
i
don't
think
there's
anything
about
that
in
the
record.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
well,
there's
no
doubt
that
it
would
have
to
be
zoned
single
family
before
the
developer
would
consider
going
in
there
and
building.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
that's
right.
with
respect
to
the
state
action
contention
we
--
we
feel
that
whether
you
look
at
it
from
what
the
state
has
done
with
respect
to
the
subdivision
under
the
burton
versus
wilmington
parking
authority
approach,
or
whether
you
look
at
it
from
the
other
approach
of
the
powers
that
are
given
to
the
developer
in
either
case,
you
would
have
to
find
that
there's
a
state
and
governmental
function
being
exercised
which
would
require
the
respondents
to
deal
with
the
property
in
a
nondiscriminatory
manner.
in
other
words,
they
can't
set
this
thing
up
by
calling
part
of
it
private
action
when
it's
really
a
public
function
and
avoid
the
constitutional
responsibility.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
more
because
of
its
function
mr.
justice
because
the
fact
that
number
one,
from
the
standpoint
of
the
state
does,
if
they
say,
“zone
it,”
then
they
operate
with
the
building
of
roads
and
the
tying
in
of
the
old
roads.
the
statutes,
by
the
way,
as
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief
filed
by
the
united
states'
amicus
showing
how
they
have
to
rename
the
streets
to
continue
whatever
existing
roads
might
be
going
up
to
the
subdivision.
and
how
they
have
to
get
approval
as
to
the
various
facility,
sewers
and
parks
and
sidewalks
and
how
they
have
to
satisfy
the
government
that
they've
taken
into
account,
access
to
existing
schools
and
highways
and
so
forth.
so,
that
the
government
actually,
the
various
departments
of
the
government
have
a
great
deal
to
say
as
to
have
a
subdivision
built.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
not
to
the
same
extent,
i
don't
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
yes.
well,
i
think
with
the
private
house
you
wouldn't
have
questions
of
roads
and
sewers
and
parks
and
that
sort
of
question
involved
nor
would
you
have
provisions
in
the
laws
requiring
the
builder
to
show
how
he's
--
what
measures
he's
taken
to
keep
up
the
character
of
the
neighborhood.
and
encouraging
to
file
a
deed
of
restrictions,
which
was
set
forth
of
course
all
the
really
the
things
equivalent
to
zonings
such
as
what
kind
of
fences
people
can
have.
and
--
in
other
words,
in
this
case,
we
feel
that
that
power
which
by
ordinarily
been
a
law
has
been
delegated
to
the
builders
and
they
can
--
within
the
deed
of
restrictions
which
runs
with
the
property
and
all
the
property
in
the
subdivision,
they
have
the
right
to
enforce
it
by
making
assessments.
and
enforcing
these
assessments
on
the
property
owners,
if
they
buy
there
and
they
become
in
effect
a
governmental
authority
by
virtue
of
their
power
under
the
deed
of
restrictions
governing
the
subdivision.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
yes.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
that
would
be
approximately
250
units
as
it
was
alleged
in
the
complaint
perhaps
mr.
treiman
can
answer
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
--
more
accurately
on
how
it's
worked
out.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
i'm
not
aware
of
the
exact
dimensions
of
a
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
well
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
we
do
rely
in
marsh
versus
alabama
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
as
i
say,
the
size
is
not
set
forth
in
the
exact
dimension
but
we
feel
that
the
--
more
important
than
the
size
is
the
power
and
the
function
of
this
--
of
the
developers
in
this
case.
in
other
words,
i
don't
think
marsh
versus
alabama
would
be
limited
as
to
whether
those
are
a
small
town
or
a
big
town
or
a
medium
town,
it's
a
question
as
to
whether
they
are
exercising
in
this
function.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
well,
not
necessarily,
but
--
i
mean
we
say
this
is
the
equivalent
of
a
town
and
of
course
if
there
was
one
person,
then
it
wouldn't
be
the
equivalent
of
the
town
but
we
think
that
the
function
is
more
important
than
actually
the
size
of
a
number
of
lots.
it's
also
set
forth
in
the
appendix
that
with
the
adjoining
subdivisions
that
it
will
be
a
community
involving
at
least
10,000
families
i
believe
also.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
well,
not
within
the
development,
no.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
well,
i
would
say
it's
not
the
town
in
the
sense
of
marsh
versus
alabama
but
in
the
sense
of
the
110
municipalities
in
saint
louis
county,
you
know,
it's
as
much
a
town
as
many
of
them.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
right.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
that's
--
as
i
understand
in
the
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
i
believe
the
streets
become
public
streets,
the
sidewalks
i'm
not
sure
about.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
right,
for
the
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
yes,
and
there
are
public
recreation
areas
involved.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
there's
a
golf
course
and
bathe
and
tennis
club,
but
in
addition,
i
think
there's
open
recreation
space.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
no,
not
within
the
kind
of
course.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
there
--
no
--
yes,
in
other
words,
the
builder
has
not
received
a
commitment
for
an
fha
or
federally
insured
loan
in
the
subdivision.
i
--
it's
probably
irrelevant.
i
assume
that
there
are
certain
buyers
who
have
gone
in
and
bought
these
lots
of
who've
got
an
fha
loan,
but
there
is
no
commitment
made
to
the
builder
or
to
the
respondents
to
give
such
loans
for
paddock.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
yes,
possibly
and
as
i
said,
there's
really
no
record
on
that
and
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
yes.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
not
in
this
record
your
honor,
no
and
i
don't
believe
there
are
such.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
i
think
a
park
--
open
land
in
the
nature
of
playground
and
park
which
of
course
has
to
be
maintained
by
the
subdivision
by
assessment
or
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
no,
by
the
subdivisions.
it's
alleged
that
way.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
i
think
the
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
that's
right.
there
some
of
these
others
subdivisions
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
no.
well,
no.
as
i
have
alleged
that
the
respondents
have
other
subdivisions
in
a
contiguous
area
there.
it
where
--
in
other
words,
this
subdivision
is
paddock
woods,
but
there's
also
wedgwood
and
paddock
hills
and
paddock
estates
and
some
of
these
older
subdivisions
did
have
fha
insurance
commitments.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
yes,
that's
to
the
developer.
if
you
got
a
commitment
from
the
fha
that's
made
to
the
developer
that
they
wasn't
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
not
in
paddock
woods,
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
--
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
your
honor,
i
said
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
i
have
three
answers.
and
the
first
is
that,
i
think
that
1983
could
cover
under
any
customer
usage
of
the
state.
i
think
perhaps
a
better
statute
would
be
section
1988
which
is
derived
from
section
3
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
and
specifically
says
that
civil
actions
may
get
the
remedy
from
the
state
common
law
as
modified
by
statutes.
thirdly,
i
would
say
that
regardless
that
there
was
any
statute
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
create
a
right
without
a
remedy
in
this
situation.
that
this
legislation
was
a
result
going
back
to
the
civil
war
perhaps
at
that
time
the
bloodiest
war
ever
fought
in
the
history
of
mankind.
and
following
the
thirteenth
amendment,
(inaudible)
was
enacted
once,
passed
over
the
veto
of
president
johnson
and
then
enacted
the
third
time
in
1870.
and
i
think
it's
difficult
to
argue
that
congress
contended
to
merely
create
hollow
words
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
that's
--
i
think
that
would
be
the
third
ground
that
we
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
yes,
i
really
--
i
wouldn't
see
what
--
if
any
harder
than
somebody
makes
an
illegal
left
turn
and
smacks
in
to
me.
i
can
file
a
suit
and
say
it
was
negligent
of
him
to
make
that
left
turn
and
get
a
judicial
remedy
even
though
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
well,
but
in
addition,
i
do
think
that
there
is
a
statutory
authority
for
a
civil
remedy
in
the
court
in
this
type
of
case.
as
to
the
interpretation
of
the
statute,
i
wanted
to
go
back
briefly
to
the
passages
quoted
from
mr.
treiman's
brief.
on
page
15,
you'll
note
that
the
quotation,
the
first
both
to
laws
barbaric
and
treatment
inhumane
are
the
words
meted
out
by
our
white
enemies
to
our
colored
friends,
obviously
referring
to
both
state
law
and
private
action.
across
the
page
on
page
14,
i
think
the
quote
is
obviously
referring
in
section
2
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866,
which
is
limited,
done
or
a
color
of
state
law.
but
that
limitation
--
the
congress
knew
how
to
make
and
made
it
in
much
legislation
and
left
it
out
in
the
section
1
and
section
3.
so,
that
i
think
you
can
fairly
interpret
their
intention
as
living
it
out
intentionally
when
they
didn't
mean
for
it
to
be
there.
this
legislation
unlike
the
prior
freedmen's
bureau
bill
applied
to
all
states
not
just
to
the
states
which
had
been
in
rebellion.
and
i
think
that
it
was
aimed
at
the
results
and
the
holding
of
this
court
in
scott
versus
sanford.
to
some
extent,
it
was
not
just
to
wipe
out
inimical
state
laws.
it
was
to
grant
the
rights
to
which
people
were
entitled
regardless
of
whether
the
particular
state
they
were
in
had
a
law
that
would've
limited
that
right
or
not
as
applied
everywhere.
so
that
--
so
our
contention
that
the
law
--
we
don't
argue
that
it
would
overwrite
any
state
law
to
the
contrary
because
it
says
right
at
the
end,
any
law
statute
ordinance
regulation
accustomed
to
the
contrary
not
withstanding.
but
we
think
it
had
a
broader
purpose
as
well.
if
it
were
only
attempting
to
remove
a
certain
disqualifications,
i
think
this
would've
been
accomplished
by
the
constitutional
amendments
anyway.
but
it
also
would've
been
accomplished
by
the
other
parts
of
section
1
of
that
act,
which
gave
all
persons
the
equal
right
to
make
enforced
contracts,
to
sue
and
be
parties,
give
evidence
in
court.
and
to
the
same
--
fall
on
equal
benefit
of
all
laws
and
proceedings
by
the
security
of
persons
and
properties.
so,
i
think
that
language
alone
would've
remove
any
disqualification
whether
by
state
law
or
otherwise
and
that
when
they
go
on
to
say,
shall
have
the
same
right
to
inherit,
and
to
purchase
and
to
lease.
that
they
meant
that
he
would
have
the
substantive
right,
the
same
right
as
is
enjoyed
by
all
other
citizens.
and
if
this
was
the
interpretation
which
congress
had
and
which
is
the
only
fair
interpretation
on
the
basis
of
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
on
a
judgment
which
simply
affirmed
a
holding
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
missouri
dismissing
the
amended
complaint
in
these
actions
for
failure
to
state
the
cause
of
action
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted.
therefore,
the
facts
which
are
well
pleaded
in
the
first
amendment
complaints
set
out
in
the
appendix
are
the
facts
which
we
are
dealing
with.
these
facts
alleged
that
the
respondents,
a
group
of
related
corporations
and
one
individual
or
developers
of
a
subdivision
known
paddock
woods
in
st.
louis
county,
missouri.
they
also
are
developers
of
adjacent
subdivisions
known
as
paddock
estates,
paddock
meadows,
paddock
hills,
and
wedgwood
and
perhaps
some
others.
they
received
permission
from
various
estate
agencies
to
build
these
divisions
including
paddock
woods.
they
layout
the
streets
and
the
sewers
and
the
recreation
facilities
and
various
other
facilities
and
then
they
plot
out
certain
lots
and
they
sell
houses
and
lots
to
the
public.
the
method
of
selling
is
by
buildings
and
display
houses
of
different
types
on
the
--
at
the
location
of
the
subdivision.
and
then
the
public
looks
at
the
display
house
and
the
buyer,
if
he
likes
one
of
the
houses,
will
enter
into
a
contract
by
which
the
respondents
will
build
a
certain
house
according
to
the
choice
of
the
buyer
on
a
certain
lot.
and
when
it's
completed,
the
transfer
of
the
property
is
then
made.
it's
further
alleged
that
the
estate
in
the
various
governmental
subdivisions
of
the
estate
are
involved
with
the
building
of
the
subdivision
both
in
the
approval
and
the
assistance
which
they
give
to
the
builder
and
from
the
standpoint
of
the
function
--
community
functions
which
they
delegate
to
the
builder
with
respect
to
the
government
of
this
community.
the
facts
out
of
this
case
in
particular
arose
from
mr.
and
mrs.
joseph
jones,
the
petitioners
went
out
to
the
subdivision
and
saw
a
house
which
they
wanted
to
buy
and
attempted
buy
it,
and
it
is
alleged
that
the
respondents
refused
to
deal
with
them
or
to
sell
them
a
house
solely
because
mr.
jones
is
a
negro.
the
question
presented
has
led
to
certain
refusal
solely
because
of
the
raise
of
the
prospective
buyer
is
in
violation
of
the
law
of
the
united
states.
in
our
brief,
this
question
took
two
forms,
firstly,
whether
the
conduct
is
prohibited
by
section
1978
of
the
revised
statutes
42
u.s.c.,
section
1982.
secondly,
whether
regardless
of
the
statute
on
the
particular
facts
of
the
case
due
to
the
nature
of
the
subdivision,
the
developer
would
be
barred
from
discriminating
in
excluding
negroes
even
without
a
statute
because
of
the
amount
of
state
action
which
would
be
involved
in
the
building
of
the
subdivision.
also
in
our
brief,
we
broke
down
the
question
concerning
the
statute
into
its
interpretation
and
as
to
whether
if
interpreted
as
barring
this
kind
of
conduct
by
developer
whether
that
would
be
a
constitutional
--
constitutionally
valid
statute.
actually,
it
has
been
conceded
by
the
respondents
that
such
interpretation
would
be
constitutional
and
in
fact
the
court
below,
the
court
of
appeals,
judge
blackmun
held
in
his
opinion
there
was
a
matter
of
interpretation
of
the
statute
rather
than
a
constitutional
question.
so,
addressing
my
first
--
myself
first
to
the
statutory
question
rather
than
the
constitutional
question,
we
think
that
the
statute
by
its
plain
terms
bars
a
builder
of
a
private
subdivision
from
excluding
persons
from
buying
and
living
in
that
subdivision
because
of
their
race.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
your
honor,
that
question
is
not
before
the
court
in
this
case
because
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
in
my
view
of
the
statute,
it
would
apply
to
an
individual
house
owner
as
well
but
of
course
that
and
we
have
here
a
subdivision
developer
in
which
bar
make
it
much
broader
type
of
exclusion
as
it's
pointed
out
in
the
brief
of
united
states.
the
question
concerning
the
interpretation
can
be
looked
at
from
the
standpoint
of
the
history
and
from
a
standpoint
of
what
the
statute
says.
the
history
of
the
statute
is
set
out
at
length
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
respondents
and
there's
more
of
it
set
out
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
united
states
and
in
the
amicus
filed
by
the
group
of
organizations
and
by
the
national
committee
against
discrimination
in
housing.
we
think
that
the
history,
it
shows
abundant
awareness
on
the
part
of
the
drafters
of
this
law
but
it
would
apply
to
individual
action
as
well
as
to
action
only
by
the
state.
the
--
although
there
are
some
mentioned
in
the
debates
concerning
this
law
of
the
problem
of
state
action
looked
at
in
the
historical
standpoint.
i
do
not
think
you
can
interpret
it
as
meaning
that
would
only
cover
state
action.
in
other
words,
the
congress
at
that
time
was
concerned
with
state
action
from
the
standpoint
that
they
have
no
doubt
under
the
accepted
constitutional
doctrine
in
the
mcculloch
versus
maryland
and
prigg
versus
pennsylvania
that
they
can
do
what
they
wished
with
respect
to
controlling
the
conduct
of
individuals
in
violation
of
constitutional
rights.
they
were
concerned
what
would
happen
when
the
individuals
might
have
some
federal
legislation
on
our
position
to
state
legislation
either
permitting
or
in
some
cases
requiring
discriminatory
conduct
and
for
this
reason,
the
debates
did
at
times
focused
on
the
question
of
state
action
and
it
was
resolved
that
the
state
law
would
have
to
give
way
to
the
federal
law.
nevertheless,
there's
very
little
in
the
debates,
there's
very
little
even
in
the
quotations
of
respondent's
brief
on
pages
16
to
19
from
which
you
can
make
the
negative
entrance
because
they
were
covering
what
the
states
might
do,
they
didn't
intend
to
cover
what
individuals
might
do.
the
--
excuse
me.
regardless,
the
--
how
you
that
you
can't
tell
what
was
in
the
mind
of
every
member
of
congress,
the
debate
was
certainly
lengthy
in
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
as
applying
to
individuals
was
brought
out
often
enough
that
we
can
assume
that
the
congress
was
aware
of
the
issue
and
dealt
carefully
in
the
language
which
it
chose
to
adopt
to
say
what
it
meant.
now,
this
statute,
originally
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
is
set
out
in
full
of
the
appendix
of
petitioner's
brief,
and
looking
at
the
language
you
might
know
that
the
first
place
has
entitled
an
act
to
protect
all
persons
in
united
states
in
these
civil
rights
and
furnish
the
means
of
their
vindication.
it's
not
entitled
an
act
to
prevent
the
states
from
discriminating.
it's
a
positively
worded
act
in
its
title
and
in
its
language
itself
which
has
boiled
down
in
section
1982,
it's
just
of
all
citizens
of
the
united
states
shall
have
the
same
right
in
every
state
and
territory
as
is
enjoined
by
white
citizens
thereof
to
inherit
purchase,
lease,
sell,
hold
and
convey
real
and
personal
property.
it
--
the
language
emphasizes
not
the
--
what
the
states
may
not
do
and
doesn't
even
refer
to
that
but
rather
what
the
right
of
an
individual
citizen
who
wishes
to
buy
and
hold
property
is.
furthermore,
it
goes
further
not
even
talking
about
the
right
itself
but
the
enjoyment
of
the
right.
so,
that
it
would
seem
from
the
language
itself
that
we
would
have
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
they
meant
that
this
was
not
meant
to
be
nearly
some
sort
of
negative
restriction
on
what
the
states
or
anyone
else
might
do
but
was
supposed
to
set
forth
the
enjoyment
that
the
right
to
which
people,
particularly
negroes,
have
the
right
to
enjoy.
the
statute
in
question
has
not
received
a
great
deal
of
interpretation
particularly
in
this
court.
in
fact,
the
only
case
that
really
directly
deals
with
these
interpretations
of
the
statute
is
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
morris
which
is
a
district
court
case
and
an
old
case
but
it
upholds
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
what
we
would
give
to
it.
as
far
as
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
statute
has
been
referred
to
collaterally
in
such
cases
of
buchanan
versus
warley
and
oyama
versus
california
but
it
doesn't
mention
any
limiting
aspect
of
the
statute.
and
there
are
some
other
decisions
notably
the
dictum
in
hurd
versus
hodge
which
would
limit
perhaps,
from
which
the
limitation
can
be
implied.
we
feel
that
this
limitation
is
not
--
have
it
by
way
of
dictum
comes
in
conflict
with
the
earlier
cases
dealing
with
the
statute
which
don't
see
any
implication
limiting
the
statute
to
state
action
and
which
do
--
the
fact,
the
earlier
cases
with
respect
to
other
reconstruction
civil
rights
legislation,
almost
all
of
them
refused
to
make
any
such
interpretation
even
though
in
some
cases
it
might
have
saved
the
constitutionality
of
the
law.
furthermore,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
such
implied
limitation
by
hurd
versus
hodge,
we
think
that
it
will
resolve
more
from
a
constitutional
feeling
of
the
court
at
that
time
that
there
was
some
constitutional
limitation
on
the
statute
rather
than
what
the
statute
was
intended.
and
in
the
holdings
of
this
court
in
the
katzenbach
versus
morgan
and
united
states
versus
price
and
the
guest
case,
this
limiting
constitutional
interpretation
of
the
power
of
congress
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
section
5
has
been
abandoned.
so
that
any
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
originally
it
was
enacted
under
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
reenacted
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
yes.
i
was
referring
to
the
force,
if
any,
of
the
dictum
in
hurd
versus
hodge
which
i
think
was
did
perhaps
imply
some
limitation
due
to
fourteenth
amendment
construction
which
i
was
urging
has
been
abandoned
since
that
time
by
this
court
and
in
the
guest
case
and
the
price
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
i
don't
--
it's
our
opinion
that
we
don't
have
to
whether
they
were
really
engaged
in
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
yes.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
i
think
that
that
implication
may
have
been
made
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
think
that
argument
will
be
made
by
the
respondents,
i
think
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
yes,
and
my
answer
to
it
would
be
that
if
congress
had
intended
any
such
repealer,
they
certainly
would've
gone
about
it
in
a
more
direct
way
rather
than
reenacting
the
same
statute
in
the
same
words
verbatim.
a
further
argument
is
made
with
respect
to
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
it
is
argued
in
the
respondent's
brief
that
there
is
no
appropriate
remedy
set
out
for
a
violation
of
a
statute
and
i
think
that
this
--
if
you'll
examine
section
3
of
a
statute
it
clearly
--
section
3
of
the
statute
is
originally
enacted,
it
clearly
envisions
that
remedy
may
be
by
a
civil
suit
and
pursuant
to
the
ordinary
remedies
and
says
to
the
extent
that
where
the
law
has
not
provided
sufficient
remedies,
the
state
common
law
can
furnish
the
necessary
equitable
remedies
as
they
do
in
all
cases
involving
real
property.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
i
think
it's
--
it
becomes
section
1988,
it's
been
rewarded
quite
a
bit
but
this
particular
language
as
to
the
finding
of
the
remedy
under
state
laws
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
--
42
united
states
code,
section
of
1988.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
42.
furthermore,
there
is
real
no
real
difficulty
in
furnishing
a
remedy
and
a
case
like
this
involving
real
property
and
the
courts
of
equity
have
been
doing
this
for
a
long
time
and
compared
to
--
even
the
reapportionment
case
or
school
segregation
case,
the
remedy
is
quite
simple
and
much
within
the
judicial
remedies
and
functions
which
are
traditional.
in
conclusion
with
respect
to
the
statute,
we
feel
that
the
language
is
as
broad
as
can
be
imagined
and
actually
the
opposite
interpretation
was
least
the
majority
free
to
exclude
the
minority
from
any
particular
county
or
portion
of
the
county
or
state
in
the
united
states
and
with
the
effect
that
this
did
have
on
--
it
does
have
on
schools
and
jobs
and
voting.
we
think
that
clearly
that
congress
did
not
mean
that
the
right
to
purchase
housing
or
lease
housing
was
to
be
dependent
upon
the
will
of
the
white
majority
which
at
that
time
after
all
probably
unclosed
to
100%
of
the
property.
turning
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
argument,
we
argue
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case
that
conceding
that
we
might
concede
that
the
statute
did
not
apply
and
still
it
would
have
to
be
a
reversal
of
the
dismissal
of
the
complaint
because
there
are
so
much
state
action
involved
in
the
building
of
a
subdivision
of
this
type
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
i
don't
think
there's
anything
about
that
in
the
record.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
well,
there's
no
doubt
that
it
would
have
to
be
zoned
single
family
before
the
developer
would
consider
going
in
there
and
building.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
that's
right.
with
respect
to
the
state
action
contention
we
--
we
feel
that
whether
you
look
at
it
from
what
the
state
has
done
with
respect
to
the
subdivision
under
the
burton
versus
wilmington
parking
authority
approach,
or
whether
you
look
at
it
from
the
other
approach
of
the
powers
that
are
given
to
the
developer
in
either
case,
you
would
have
to
find
that
there's
a
state
and
governmental
function
being
exercised
which
would
require
the
respondents
to
deal
with
the
property
in
a
nondiscriminatory
manner.
in
other
words,
they
can't
set
this
thing
up
by
calling
part
of
it
private
action
when
it's
really
a
public
function
and
avoid
the
constitutional
responsibility.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
more
because
of
its
function
mr.
justice
because
the
fact
that
number
one,
from
the
standpoint
of
the
state
does,
if
they
say,
“zone
it,”
then
they
operate
with
the
building
of
roads
and
the
tying
in
of
the
old
roads.
the
statutes,
by
the
way,
as
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief
filed
by
the
united
states'
amicus
showing
how
they
have
to
rename
the
streets
to
continue
whatever
existing
roads
might
be
going
up
to
the
subdivision.
and
how
they
have
to
get
approval
as
to
the
various
facility,
sewers
and
parks
and
sidewalks
and
how
they
have
to
satisfy
the
government
that
they've
taken
into
account,
access
to
existing
schools
and
highways
and
so
forth.
so,
that
the
government
actually,
the
various
departments
of
the
government
have
a
great
deal
to
say
as
to
have
a
subdivision
built.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
not
to
the
same
extent,
i
don't
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
yes.
well,
i
think
with
the
private
house
you
wouldn't
have
questions
of
roads
and
sewers
and
parks
and
that
sort
of
question
involved
nor
would
you
have
provisions
in
the
laws
requiring
the
builder
to
show
how
he's
--
what
measures
he's
taken
to
keep
up
the
character
of
the
neighborhood.
and
encouraging
to
file
a
deed
of
restrictions,
which
was
set
forth
of
course
all
the
really
the
things
equivalent
to
zonings
such
as
what
kind
of
fences
people
can
have.
and
--
in
other
words,
in
this
case,
we
feel
that
that
power
which
by
ordinarily
been
a
law
has
been
delegated
to
the
builders
and
they
can
--
within
the
deed
of
restrictions
which
runs
with
the
property
and
all
the
property
in
the
subdivision,
they
have
the
right
to
enforce
it
by
making
assessments.
and
enforcing
these
assessments
on
the
property
owners,
if
they
buy
there
and
they
become
in
effect
a
governmental
authority
by
virtue
of
their
power
under
the
deed
of
restrictions
governing
the
subdivision.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
yes.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
that
would
be
approximately
250
units
as
it
was
alleged
in
the
complaint
perhaps
mr.
treiman
can
answer
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
--
more
accurately
on
how
it's
worked
out.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
i'm
not
aware
of
the
exact
dimensions
of
a
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
well
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
we
do
rely
in
marsh
versus
alabama
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
as
i
say,
the
size
is
not
set
forth
in
the
exact
dimension
but
we
feel
that
the
--
more
important
than
the
size
is
the
power
and
the
function
of
this
--
of
the
developers
in
this
case.
in
other
words,
i
don't
think
marsh
versus
alabama
would
be
limited
as
to
whether
those
are
a
small
town
or
a
big
town
or
a
medium
town,
it's
a
question
as
to
whether
they
are
exercising
in
this
function.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
well,
not
necessarily,
but
--
i
mean
we
say
this
is
the
equivalent
of
a
town
and
of
course
if
there
was
one
person,
then
it
wouldn't
be
the
equivalent
of
the
town
but
we
think
that
the
function
is
more
important
than
actually
the
size
of
a
number
of
lots.
it's
also
set
forth
in
the
appendix
that
with
the
adjoining
subdivisions
that
it
will
be
a
community
involving
at
least
10,000
families
i
believe
also.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
well,
not
within
the
development,
no.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
well,
i
would
say
it's
not
the
town
in
the
sense
of
marsh
versus
alabama
but
in
the
sense
of
the
110
municipalities
in
saint
louis
county,
you
know,
it's
as
much
a
town
as
many
of
them.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
right.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
that's
--
as
i
understand
in
the
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
i
believe
the
streets
become
public
streets,
the
sidewalks
i'm
not
sure
about.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
right,
for
the
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
yes,
and
there
are
public
recreation
areas
involved.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
there's
a
golf
course
and
bathe
and
tennis
club,
but
in
addition,
i
think
there's
open
recreation
space.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
no,
not
within
the
kind
of
course.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
there
--
no
--
yes,
in
other
words,
the
builder
has
not
received
a
commitment
for
an
fha
or
federally
insured
loan
in
the
subdivision.
i
--
it's
probably
irrelevant.
i
assume
that
there
are
certain
buyers
who
have
gone
in
and
bought
these
lots
of
who've
got
an
fha
loan,
but
there
is
no
commitment
made
to
the
builder
or
to
the
respondents
to
give
such
loans
for
paddock.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
yes,
possibly
and
as
i
said,
there's
really
no
record
on
that
and
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
yes.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
not
in
this
record
your
honor,
no
and
i
don't
believe
there
are
such.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
i
think
a
park
--
open
land
in
the
nature
of
playground
and
park
which
of
course
has
to
be
maintained
by
the
subdivision
by
assessment
or
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
no,
by
the
subdivisions.
it's
alleged
that
way.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
i
think
the
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
that's
right.
there
some
of
these
others
subdivisions
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
no.
well,
no.
as
i
have
alleged
that
the
respondents
have
other
subdivisions
in
a
contiguous
area
there.
it
where
--
in
other
words,
this
subdivision
is
paddock
woods,
but
there's
also
wedgwood
and
paddock
hills
and
paddock
estates
and
some
of
these
older
subdivisions
did
have
fha
insurance
commitments.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
yes,
that's
to
the
developer.
if
you
got
a
commitment
from
the
fha
that's
made
to
the
developer
that
they
wasn't
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
not
in
paddock
woods,
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
--
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
your
honor,
i
said
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
i
have
three
answers.
and
the
first
is
that,
i
think
that
1983
could
cover
under
any
customer
usage
of
the
state.
i
think
perhaps
a
better
statute
would
be
section
1988
which
is
derived
from
section
3
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
and
specifically
says
that
civil
actions
may
get
the
remedy
from
the
state
common
law
as
modified
by
statutes.
thirdly,
i
would
say
that
regardless
that
there
was
any
statute
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
create
a
right
without
a
remedy
in
this
situation.
that
this
legislation
was
a
result
going
back
to
the
civil
war
perhaps
at
that
time
the
bloodiest
war
ever
fought
in
the
history
of
mankind.
and
following
the
thirteenth
amendment,
(inaudible)
was
enacted
once,
passed
over
the
veto
of
president
johnson
and
then
enacted
the
third
time
in
1870.
and
i
think
it's
difficult
to
argue
that
congress
contended
to
merely
create
hollow
words
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
that's
--
i
think
that
would
be
the
third
ground
that
we
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
yes,
i
really
--
i
wouldn't
see
what
--
if
any
harder
than
somebody
makes
an
illegal
left
turn
and
smacks
in
to
me.
i
can
file
a
suit
and
say
it
was
negligent
of
him
to
make
that
left
turn
and
get
a
judicial
remedy
even
though
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
samuel
h.
liberman
well,
but
in
addition,
i
do
think
that
there
is
a
statutory
authority
for
a
civil
remedy
in
the
court
in
this
type
of
case.
as
to
the
interpretation
of
the
statute,
i
wanted
to
go
back
briefly
to
the
passages
quoted
from
mr.
treiman's
brief.
on
page
15,
you'll
note
that
the
quotation,
the
first
both
to
laws
barbaric
and
treatment
inhumane
are
the
words
meted
out
by
our
white
enemies
to
our
colored
friends,
obviously
referring
to
both
state
law
and
private
action.
across
the
page
on
page
14,
i
think
the
quote
is
obviously
referring
in
section
2
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866,
which
is
limited,
done
or
a
color
of
state
law.
but
that
limitation
--
the
congress
knew
how
to
make
and
made
it
in
much
legislation
and
left
it
out
in
the
section
1
and
section
3.
so,
that
i
think
you
can
fairly
interpret
their
intention
as
living
it
out
intentionally
when
they
didn't
mean
for
it
to
be
there.
this
legislation
unlike
the
prior
freedmen's
bureau
bill
applied
to
all
states
not
just
to
the
states
which
had
been
in
rebellion.
and
i
think
that
it
was
aimed
at
the
results
and
the
holding
of
this
court
in
scott
versus
sanford.
to
some
extent,
it
was
not
just
to
wipe
out
inimical
state
laws.
it
was
to
grant
the
rights
to
which
people
were
entitled
regardless
of
whether
the
particular
state
they
were
in
had
a
law
that
would've
limited
that
right
or
not
as
applied
everywhere.
so
that
--
so
our
contention
that
the
law
--
we
don't
argue
that
it
would
overwrite
any
state
law
to
the
contrary
because
it
says
right
at
the
end,
any
law
statute
ordinance
regulation
accustomed
to
the
contrary
not
withstanding.
but
we
think
it
had
a
broader
purpose
as
well.
if
it
were
only
attempting
to
remove
a
certain
disqualifications,
i
think
this
would've
been
accomplished
by
the
constitutional
amendments
anyway.
but
it
also
would've
been
accomplished
by
the
other
parts
of
section
1
of
that
act,
which
gave
all
persons
the
equal
right
to
make
enforced
contracts,
to
sue
and
be
parties,
give
evidence
in
court.
and
to
the
same
--
fall
on
equal
benefit
of
all
laws
and
proceedings
by
the
security
of
persons
and
properties.
so,
i
think
that
language
alone
would've
remove
any
disqualification
whether
by
state
law
or
otherwise
and
that
when
they
go
on
to
say,
shall
have
the
same
right
to
inherit,
and
to
purchase
and
to
lease.
that
they
meant
that
he
would
have
the
substantive
right,
the
same
right
as
is
enjoyed
by
all
other
citizens.
and
if
this
was
the
interpretation
which
congress
had
and
which
is
the
only
fair
interpretation
on
the
basis
of
the
language
of
the
statute.
