how
large?
how
many
families

i
read
some
part
of
it,
it's
sort
of
a
thousand
people.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
like
to
know
how
many
units
are
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
covering
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
covering
how
much
territory?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
that
important?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
--
or
do
you
or
do
you
not
rely
on
marsh
against
alabama.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
then,
what's
the
size
of
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
know
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
it
have
to
be
a
town?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
agree
that
this
area
could
qualify
as
a
city
of
the
fourth
class?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
assuming
they
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
of
(voice

--
justice
thurgood
marshall
setting
the
fourth
class
and
pass
an
ordinance
which
prohibited
all
negroes
and
cats
who
live
in
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
a
private
action?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what?
what
would
it
violate,
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what's
the
difference
between
this
situation
and
the
formality
of
the
clan
in
a
city?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
the
city
of
the
--
what
would
the
city
of
the
fourth
class
have
to
this
area
does
not
have?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
the
only
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
but
any
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
could
any
other
city
in
missouri?
justice
thurgood
marshall
even
though
the
private
owner
has
a
piece
of
property
as
large
as
a
city
of
the
fourth
class
with
everything
else
that
the
city
of
the
fourth
class
has
nearly
because
it
is
“private”
is
out
from
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
whenever
you're
ready
i'll
be
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
see
a
difference
between
an
apartment
house
and
this
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
of
an
apartment
house
and
the
area
we're
talking
about
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
say
--
i
see
a
difference
between
a
hallway
of
an
apartment
house
and
this
area.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
petitioner
here
is
not
encroached
on
anybody's
property.
he's
trying
to
buy
a
house.
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
the
city
of
the
fourth
class
says,
"you
can't
buy
it".
the
only
difference
is
they
just
didn't
go
to
the
formality
of
qualifying
as
a
city
of
the
fourth
class.
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
i'm
talking
about
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
is
just
to
whether
or
not
the
fact
that
this
area
involved
here
was
never
made
a
city
of
the
fourth
class,
that
solely
because
of
that.
it
escapes
all
responsibility
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
could
they
be
closed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn't
they
be
closed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
could
be
closed
completely?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
are
they
private
streets
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
some
public?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
would
i
know
when
i'm
on
a
private
ground,
when
i'm
on
a
public
ground
in
this
area?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
take
a
chance
on
going
to
jail
for
trespass?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
--
maybe
i
cut
you
off
but
just
now,
what
is
the
difference
between
this
and
marsh?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
trouble
with
it
not
to
be
in
set
aside
for
public
use.
it
was
offered
for
sale
to
the
public.
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
it
offered
to
the
sale
to
the
public?
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
the
public?
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
the
public?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
a
right
to
buy
a
property
is
not
as
higher
right
as
a
right
to
hand
out
pamphlets?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
you've
added
something,
i
said
the
right
to
buy
a
property.
i
didn't
say
anything
about
selling.
justice
thurgood
marshall
property
isn't
it
just
as
strong
in
the
constitution
as
the
right
to
pay
as
out
pamphlets?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
there
any
law
that
gives
a
corporation
of
this
size,
controlling
this
much
land,
the
right
to
--
fends
out
one
group
of
people
solely
because
of
race
or
color?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
court
could
do
it,
couldn't
they?
justice
thurgood

this
court
could
do
