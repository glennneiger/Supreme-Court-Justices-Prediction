mr.
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
has
asked
for
this
opportunity
appears
friend
of
the
court
because
of
its
very
great
concern
that
the
rights
here
involved
be
fully
secured
and
fulfilled
for
all
of
our
people.
the
questions
presented
are
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
section
1978
of
the
revised
statutes
prohibit
a
developer
of
a
large
suburban
community
from
refusing
to
sell
homes
within
that
community
to
negroes
solely
on
account
of
their
race.
our
concern
with
these
issues
arises
from
the
fact
that
it
is
the
experience
of
this
decade
that
of
all
discriminations,
the
most
harmful
in
and
of
itself
and
in
its
reinforcement
of
other
discriminations
is
the
discrimination
that
has
caused
segregation
in
our
living
which
is
primarily
discrimination
in
the
sale
of
housing.
segregate
living
makes
it
seems
almost
impossible
in
fulfillment
of
rights
secured
by
the
constitution
such
as
schooling,
where
in
the
first
five
years
of
this
decade,
we
have
witnessed
in
major
metropolitan
school
districts
a
vast
increase
in
percentage
of
negro
students.
as
an
illustration,
chicago
has
risen
from
40%
to
52%
negro
in
the
public
schools.
in
baltimore,
the
figure
has
risen
from
50%
to
61%.
in
saint
louis,
the
principal
city
in
the
area
from
which
this
case
comes,
negro
school
population
in
public
schools
had
risen
from
49%
to
60%.
these
arise
in
large
measure
because
of
segregation
in
housing.
it's
not
just
in
schooling,
it's
in
communications,
people
in
these
isolated
and
alienated
areas
can
hardly
be
communicated
with
by
itenerants
or
others.
it
must
be
reached
our
people
who
lived
among
them.
same
as
true
to
the
employment,
for
vital
government
services
of
recreation
and
of
health.
the
present
very
substantial
and
growing
urban
segregation
is
caused
and
maintained
in
major
part
by
discrimination
in
sales
of
housing.
between
1950
and
1960,
nonwhite
families
in
unsound
urban
housing
increased
25%
from
1.4
million
to
1.8
million.
in
this
same
decade,
nonwhite
families
and
overcrowded
urban
housing
increased
40%
from
700,000
to
a
million
families.
among
those
families
earning
$10,000
or
more
a
year,
15%
of
the
nonwhite
families
live
in
substandard
housing
compared
to
3.7%
for
white
families
of
comparable
income.
in
1960,
46%
of
our
nonwhite
urban
population
lived
in
unsound
housing
compared
to
14%
for
the
whites.
i
would
like
to
devote
my
argument
primarily
to
the
constitutional
issue
that
in
anyway
indicating
that
the
united
states
does
not
have
full
confidence
that
the
conduct
here
involved
was
prohibited
as
well
by
section
1978
for
title
42.
the
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
clearly
reveals
that
a
basic
purpose
of
that
amendment
was
securing
full
rights
to
own,
use
and
dispose
of
property.
the
first
section
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
19
--
of
1866
was
this
statute
that
we're
dealing
with
today.
contemporaneous
with
its
enactment
by
the
same
session
of
the
same
congress,
the
congress
sent
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
people
for
ratification.
it
was
concerned
at
that
time
that
the
property
rights
sought
to
be
secured
by
the
statute
enacted
that
year
to
be
preserved
also
by
constitutional
right.
this,
have
been
recognized
in
the
early
slaughter-house
cases
as
well
in
shay
--
in
shelley
v.
kraemer.
the
rights
of
the
property
were
looked
upon
is
precondition
to
nearly
all
other
rights
into
their
exercise
and
perhaps
the
most
fundamental
of
our
rights.
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
its
own
force
condemns
this
discrimination
because
of
the
involvement
of
the
states
in
its
effectuation.
as
early
as
1917
in
buchanan
v.
warley,
the
supreme
court
stuck
--
or
struck
a
statute,
the
city
of
louisville
an
ordinance,
which
restricted
the
sale
of
property
within
a
city
block
to
a
member
of
the
black
race
or
the
white
race
if
his
race
was
not
a
majority
within
that
block.
this
was
before
a
separate
and
equal
doctrine
was
disapproved
in
such
areas
of
schooling
in
transportation.
but
here,
the
potential
for
fencing
out
is
much
greater
than
the
statute
or
that
ordinance
struck
in
the
buchanan
case
which
reached
only
a
city
block.
here,
the
potential
is
to
hundred
of
thousands
of
single
family
dwellings
built
within
major
subdivisions
in
the
united
states
each
year.
a
major
part
of
our
new
housing
market
setting
at
the
very
beginning,
a
pattern
of
discrimination
that
can
be
assume
and
will
persist
for
many
years.
the
fact
of
the
conduct
of
respondents
here
is
just
fully
contrary
to
the
public
interest,
that
was
the
affect
of
the
ordinance
of
the
city
of
louisville,
restricted
in
buchanan
case.
and
it
is
as
much
the
state
acting
as
was
the
act
of
the
city
there.
in
shelley
v.
kraemer
in
1948,
this
court
held
that
the
state
cannot
enforce
private
agreements
to
restrict
the
sale
of
property.
there,
only
a
handful
of
properties
need
be
involved.
i
believe
in
the
record
in
that
case
there
were
21
separate
property
ownerships
placed
under
the
restrictive
covenant
that
was
stricken
down.
here,
again
the
fencing
out
of
the
negro
is
much
greater
and
the
action
of
the
state
in
supporting
and
enabling
and
giving
the
opportunity
to
the
developer
to
bring
this
about
ever
been
that
great
is
the
involvement
of
the
court
in
shelley
v.
kraemer
or
it
was
sought
to
enforce
a
restrictive
covenant.
mr.
clark
for
that
purpose
of
causing
discrimination,
then
it
could
not
set
itself.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
such
evidence
or
implication
in
the
record
to
that
effect
mr.
justice.
in
evans
v.
newton
in
1966,
this
court
held
that
services
rendered
by
a
private
board
of
trustees
and
providing
a
park
service
pursuant
to
the
will
of
senator
bacon
of
georgia,
in
macon,
georgia
where
municipal
in
nature
and
that
this
mere
park
service
was
so
impregnated
with
government
activity
that
state
action
was
involved
in
discrimination
in
the
use
of
the
park
was
prohibited
by
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
here,
in
paddock
woods,
their
parks,
tennis
courts,
bathing
facilities,
all
of
which
will
be
subject
to
the
restriction
against
race
that
is
created
for
this
entire
suburban
community.
in
burton
v.
wilmington
parking
authority
in
1961,
the
court
in
viewing
all
of
the
circumstances
of
the
financing
and
construction
of
a
parking
lot
in
wilmington
and
the
provision
thereof
--
by
lease
from
an
estate
of
a
private
restaurant,
held
that
the
state
was
involved
in
the
discrimination.
even
though
the
restaurant
there
under
those
circumstances
was
operated
and
maintained
by
private
company
and
in
perhaps
the
most
important
and
closely
relevant
case,
in
marsh
v.
alabama
in
1946,
the
supreme
court
held
that
a
company
town,
which
was
owned
by
gulf
shipbuilding
corporation,
built
presumably
for
furthering
the
purposes
of
that
corporation
in
building
ships,
could
not
limit
the
exercise
of
constitutional
rights
within
that
town
merely
because
of
the
combination
of
property
interest
that
it
there
owned.
far
less
extensive,
in
our
present
environment
is
the
company
town
compared
to
the
subdivision
developments
with
which
we're
here
confronted
which
make
up
perhaps
most
of
new
suburbia
which
surrounds
our
central
city
ghettos
where
so
many
of
our
minorities
are
confined
and
unable
regardless
of
their
economic
ability
to
break
loose.
the
pattern
of
segregation
created
in
these
subdivisions
will
have
exactly
the
same
effect
that
it
would
have
if
they
were
created
by
act
of
a
legislature
or
by
act
of
a
city
council.
in
regardless
of
the
ownership
of
the
property
involved,
the
public
interest
must
be
identical.
here,
paddock
woods
is
legally
indistinguishable
from
the
company
of
town
in
chickasaw,
alabama.
it
has
to
go
to
government,
the
county
government
of
saint
louis,
the
state
government
of
missouri
for
all
of
its
powers.
it
could
not
provide
what
it
provides
for
the
people
without
the
approval,
without
the
responsibility
of
state
government
in
doing
so.
it
must
provide
to
the
people
their
streets,
sidewalks,
water,
sewage,
park
facilities
as
indicated.
it
has
the
power
under
municipal
ordinance
of
the
county
of
saint
louis
to
provide
the
zoning
restrictions
through
deeds
of
record.
and
the
nature
of
these
restrictions
by
usage,
and
as
can
be
seen
from
the
ordinance
itself,
go
even
to
noxious
conduct
of
the
people
resident
in
the
area.
mr.
clark
the
--
the
authority
for
--
no,
the
authority
for
this
is
to
provide
the
opportunity
for
the
people
within
this
area
to
the
--
let
me
put
this
way
the
--
mr.
clark
yes,
that's
correct
and
that's
for
necessary
improvements
--
mr.
clark
that's
for
necessary
improvements
or
work
done
for
the
community.
mr.
clark
paddock
woods
can
repair
the
streets,
they
can
beautify
park,
they
can
put
in
trees
along
the
streets,
they
can
lay
new
sidewalks
out
and
they
can
assess
the
property
owners
to
pay
for
the
cost
of
it.
mr.
clark
and
that's
--
mr.
clark
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
the
purpose
here
goes
beyond
the
mere
creation
of
the
community.
it
goes
on
to
the
continuing
service.
the
basic
powers
of
zoning
that
i
--
that
i
described
are
set
out
in
page
82
of
the
government's
brief
where
the
municipal
ordinance
1005.130
is
set
forth.
and
it
provides
--
mr.
clark
it
begins
on
page
82
and
goes
onto
page
83.
mr.
clark
it
provides
the
powers
of
subdivision,
allowed
to
subdivide
--
or
divider
--
free
in
the
arrangement
of
streets
and
lots,
at
the
same
time
protect
the
convenience,
health,
welfare
and
safety
of
the
probable
feature
residents
of
the
subdivisions
as
well
as
the
character
of
the
surrounding
property
and
the
general
welfare
of
the
entire
area.
and
the
practices
under
that
are
set
out
back
in
about
page
17
of
our
brief
which
includes
the
placement
of
temporary
structures
on
property,
the
prevention
of
using
property
for
commercial
purposes,
and
the
control
of
obnoxious
personal
activities
of
individuals.
mr.
clark
it's
for
that
purpose
mr.
chief
justice
as
well
as
for
--
this
is
a
non-incorporated
area.
it's
for
purposes
of
saying
that
the
other
--
properties
are
not
damaged
by
the
use
to
which
this
property
is
put.
paddock
woods
qualifies
as
a
city
of
the
fourth
class
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
missouri
and
it
could,
if
it
chose,
to
be
a
city
of
the
fourth
class
under
those
laws
and
engaged
in
the
same
activities
as
a
city
of
the
fourth
class
rather
than
as
a
private
corporation.
mr.
clark
yes,
sir,
that's
it.
the
preceding
part
is
--
mr.
clark
the
other
end
point
here
too.
mr.
clark
this
section
is
the
same
section
that
i
refer
to
in
page
82
and
83
of
the
appendix
to
this
brief.
the
court
held
in
marsh
v.
alabama
that
a
jehovah's
witness
could
not
be
prohibited
because
of
the
equal
protection
clause
for
the
fourteenth
amendment
from
going
into
a
company
town
that
was
concededly
private
property
from
going
on
the
sidewalks
there
and
endeavoring
to
communicate
with
the
people
who
live
there.
and
if
--
and
the
court
held
that
the
mere
fact
that
this
was
private
property
that
this
is
a
company
of
town
or
rather
than
ordinary
city
could
not
deprive
the
inhabitants
there
of
their
constitutional
rights
to
this
sort
of
communications
or
the
rights
of
people
who
did
not
live
there
to
come
there
and
so
communicate.
it
would
seem
ironic
indeed
if
this
communication
could
not
be
prohibited,
this
casual
itenerant
communication,
but
that
the
very
right,
the
fundamental
right
to
live
there,
to
buy
there,
to
own
property
there
could
be
prohibited
as
to
the
whole
area
fencing
out
an
entire
race.
this
would
seem
to
me
that
if
its
government
action
within
the
limits
of
the
property
of
the
company
town
in
chickasaw,
alabama,
for
purposes
of
jehovah's
witnesses
coming
on
the
sidewalks
that
are
private
property,
then
it
must
be
government
action
also
for
that
corporation
and
the
disposition
of
its
property
when
it
endeavors
to
restrict
its
sales
to
people
of
the
white
race.
the
activities
of
the
city
in
marsh
v.
alabama
are
not
essentially
different
from
the
activities
of
this
suburban
community.
here,
fire
protection
has
to
be
provided.
here
streets
and
all
the
utilities
had
to
be
laid
out.
here,
the
purpose
was
to
dispose
a
property
but
they
have
an
ongoing
entity
for
its
regulation,
for
its
use,
and
for
its
enjoyment
and
that
by
definition
almost,
must
be
government
action.
we
would
urge
to
the
court
to
hold
that
when
a
subdivision
in
a
community
involving
these
many
people,
alleged
to
be
a
thousand
people
in
paddock
woods
alone,
in
a
total
development
of
2,700
families
endeavors
to
screen
out,
to
fence
out
all
negroes
that
it
is
denying
equal
protection
of
the
laws
in
a
fundamentally
governmental
activity
violating
constitutional
rights
of
the
person
so-discriminated
against.
the
statute
itself,
section
1978
is
in
the
broadest
of
language.
it
is
clearly
language
that
is
supportable
by
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
language
designed
to
prevent
the
discrimination
against
negroes,
and
the
sale
and
the
use
and
the
disposition
of
property,
and
if
they
can
be
screened
out
from
the
whole
area
here,
a
whole
community
involving
hundreds
of
families,
then
clearly
they
are
denied
the
rights
the
statute
was
designed
to
protect.
the
fact
that
the
statute
played
partially
dormant
for
many
years,
it
cannot
be
held
to
diminish
its
force
today
any
more
than
sections
241
and
242,
enacted
shortly
after
this
were
diminished.
when
it
first
came
before
the
court
in
u.s.
v.
classic
after
75
years
of
virtual
dormancy,
the
statute
is
vital
and
it's
important.
there
is
before
the
congress,
as
the
court
knows,
legislation
that
would
provide
open
housing
rights
on
a
complicated
statutory
scheme
including
administrative
judicial
and
other
sanctions
for
its
effectuation.
mr.
clark
its
potential
for
effectiveness
is
probably
much
greater
than
1978
because
of
the
sanctions
and
the
remedies
that
it
provides.
it
approaches
the
securing
of
these
rights
on
a
graduated
basis.
in
its
ultimate
reach,
it
has
three
exceptions;
single-family
dwellings
and
mrs.
murphy
situation
where
there
is
a
unit
with
more
than
four
different
families
living
within
it
and
religious
club
uses.
mr.
clark
which
exceptions
that
are
not
in
1978,
but
it
would
depend
on
how
you
interpreted
1978.
mr.
clark
it
would
be
if
--
it
would
depend
upon
the
form.
the
--
the
bill
that
passed
the
senate
would
provide
some
relief
for
these
petitioners
if
it
became
law
as
of
december
31,
1968.
it
would
not
seem
that
it
would
provide
anything
like
all
of
the
relief
that
they
are
entitled
to.
they
first
sought
a
home
beginning
in
february
1965,
a
first
endeavor
to
buy
a
particular
home
in
paddock
woods
in
june
of
1965.
it
is
most
probable
that
property
values
have
increased
substantially
there
and
perhaps
the
people
here
from
saint
louis
can
tell
you
more
about
that.
there
has
been
a
loss
of
time
and
there
have
been
other
damages
arising
to
the
petitioner
here
that
cannot
be
fully
atoned
for
by
any
new
federal
legislation.
mr.
clark
the
--
mr.
clark
it's
a
--
mr.
clark
that's
one
of
the
basis
also,
the
commerce
clause
and
--
mr.
clark
--
our
testimony,
we
put
it
on
both
--
mr.
clark
no,
i
would
assume
that
1978
would
stand
independently,
i
would
assume
as
practical
matter,
the
executive
branch
would
move
to
enforce
the
new
statute,
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
has
substantial
powers
there
even
though
they're
maybe
primarily
in
the
area
of
conciliation.
mr.
clark
we
don't
know
whether
1978
would
reach
the
single
family
dwelling
or
not.
the
court
doesn't
have
to
hold
that
here
and
a
court
has
not
at
this
time
held
that.
mr.
clark
i'd
say
it
depend
upon
the
interpretation
that
the
court
placed
on
the
statute.
although,
the
language
is
very
broad,
it
does
not
necessarily
have
to
be
construed
as
reaching
--
the
concern
is
not
before
this
court,
whether
it
would
reach
the
single-family
sale.
as
a
matter
of
proof
--
mr.
clark
--
those
cases
are
very
difficult
too
because
there
are
many
reasons
that
you
can
engage
in
a
single
sale
that
do
not
necessarily
relate
--
in
relation
with
race,
it
would
exclude
race.
mr.
clark
well,
it
would
be
up
to
the
next
case
to
determine
whether
the
court
in
this
case
held.
mr.
clark
the
theories
could
be
several
and
it
would
just
whether
1978
involves
substantial
discriminations,
whether
are
single
transaction
among
private
parties
--
mr.
clark
that's
--
mr.
clark
i
think
the
best
reading
of
the
statute
would
to
be
to
include
single-family
housing.
it
might
not
necessarily
cover
isolated
sales
however.
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
apply
to
isolated
sales
to
show
intent
among
other
things.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
has
asked
for
this
opportunity
appears
friend
of
the
court
because
of
its
very
great
concern
that
the
rights
here
involved
be
fully
secured
and
fulfilled
for
all
of
our
people.
the
questions
presented
are
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
section
1978
of
the
revised
statutes
prohibit
a
developer
of
a
large
suburban
community
from
refusing
to
sell
homes
within
that
community
to
negroes
solely
on
account
of
their
race.
our
concern
with
these
issues
arises
from
the
fact
that
it
is
the
experience
of
this
decade
that
of
all
discriminations,
the
most
harmful
in
and
of
itself
and
in
its
reinforcement
of
other
discriminations
is
the
discrimination
that
has
caused
segregation
in
our
living
which
is
primarily
discrimination
in
the
sale
of
housing.
segregate
living
makes
it
seems
almost
impossible
in
fulfillment
of
rights
secured
by
the
constitution
such
as
schooling,
where
in
the
first
five
years
of
this
decade,
we
have
witnessed
in
major
metropolitan
school
districts
a
vast
increase
in
percentage
of
negro
students.
as
an
illustration,
chicago
has
risen
from
40%
to
52%
negro
in
the
public
schools.
in
baltimore,
the
figure
has
risen
from
50%
to
61%.
in
saint
louis,
the
principal
city
in
the
area
from
which
this
case
comes,
negro
school
population
in
public
schools
had
risen
from
49%
to
60%.
these
arise
in
large
measure
because
of
segregation
in
housing.
it's
not
just
in
schooling,
it's
in
communications,
people
in
these
isolated
and
alienated
areas
can
hardly
be
communicated
with
by
itenerants
or
others.
it
must
be
reached
our
people
who
lived
among
them.
same
as
true
to
the
employment,
for
vital
government
services
of
recreation
and
of
health.
the
present
very
substantial
and
growing
urban
segregation
is
caused
and
maintained
in
major
part
by
discrimination
in
sales
of
housing.
between
1950
and
1960,
nonwhite
families
in
unsound
urban
housing
increased
25%
from
1.4
million
to
1.8
million.
in
this
same
decade,
nonwhite
families
and
overcrowded
urban
housing
increased
40%
from
700,000
to
a
million
families.
among
those
families
earning
$10,000
or
more
a
year,
15%
of
the
nonwhite
families
live
in
substandard
housing
compared
to
3.7%
for
white
families
of
comparable
income.
in
1960,
46%
of
our
nonwhite
urban
population
lived
in
unsound
housing
compared
to
14%
for
the
whites.
i
would
like
to
devote
my
argument
primarily
to
the
constitutional
issue
that
in
anyway
indicating
that
the
united
states
does
not
have
full
confidence
that
the
conduct
here
involved
was
prohibited
as
well
by
section
1978
for
title
42.
the
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
clearly
reveals
that
a
basic
purpose
of
that
amendment
was
securing
full
rights
to
own,
use
and
dispose
of
property.
the
first
section
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
19
--
of
1866
was
this
statute
that
we're
dealing
with
today.
contemporaneous
with
its
enactment
by
the
same
session
of
the
same
congress,
the
congress
sent
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
people
for
ratification.
it
was
concerned
at
that
time
that
the
property
rights
sought
to
be
secured
by
the
statute
enacted
that
year
to
be
preserved
also
by
constitutional
right.
this,
have
been
recognized
in
the
early
slaughter-house
cases
as
well
in
shay
--
in
shelley
v.
kraemer.
the
rights
of
the
property
were
looked
upon
is
precondition
to
nearly
all
other
rights
into
their
exercise
and
perhaps
the
most
fundamental
of
our
rights.
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
its
own
force
condemns
this
discrimination
because
of
the
involvement
of
the
states
in
its
effectuation.
as
early
as
1917
in
buchanan
v.
warley,
the
supreme
court
stuck
--
or
struck
a
statute,
the
city
of
louisville
an
ordinance,
which
restricted
the
sale
of
property
within
a
city
block
to
a
member
of
the
black
race
or
the
white
race
if
his
race
was
not
a
majority
within
that
block.
this
was
before
a
separate
and
equal
doctrine
was
disapproved
in
such
areas
of
schooling
in
transportation.
but
here,
the
potential
for
fencing
out
is
much
greater
than
the
statute
or
that
ordinance
struck
in
the
buchanan
case
which
reached
only
a
city
block.
here,
the
potential
is
to
hundred
of
thousands
of
single
family
dwellings
built
within
major
subdivisions
in
the
united
states
each
year.
a
major
part
of
our
new
housing
market
setting
at
the
very
beginning,
a
pattern
of
discrimination
that
can
be
assume
and
will
persist
for
many
years.
the
fact
of
the
conduct
of
respondents
here
is
just
fully
contrary
to
the
public
interest,
that
was
the
affect
of
the
ordinance
of
the
city
of
louisville,
restricted
in
buchanan
case.
and
it
is
as
much
the
state
acting
as
was
the
act
of
the
city
there.
in
shelley
v.
kraemer
in
1948,
this
court
held
that
the
state
cannot
enforce
private
agreements
to
restrict
the
sale
of
property.
there,
only
a
handful
of
properties
need
be
involved.
i
believe
in
the
record
in
that
case
there
were
21
separate
property
ownerships
placed
under
the
restrictive
covenant
that
was
stricken
down.
here,
again
the
fencing
out
of
the
negro
is
much
greater
and
the
action
of
the
state
in
supporting
and
enabling
and
giving
the
opportunity
to
the
developer
to
bring
this
about
ever
been
that
great
is
the
involvement
of
the
court
in
shelley
v.
kraemer
or
it
was
sought
to
enforce
a
restrictive
covenant.
mr.
clark
for
that
purpose
of
causing
discrimination,
then
it
could
not
set
itself.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
such
evidence
or
implication
in
the
record
to
that
effect
mr.
justice.
in
evans
v.
newton
in
1966,
this
court
held
that
services
rendered
by
a
private
board
of
trustees
and
providing
a
park
service
pursuant
to
the
will
of
senator
bacon
of
georgia,
in
macon,
georgia
where
municipal
in
nature
and
that
this
mere
park
service
was
so
impregnated
with
government
activity
that
state
action
was
involved
in
discrimination
in
the
use
of
the
park
was
prohibited
by
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
here,
in
paddock
woods,
their
parks,
tennis
courts,
bathing
facilities,
all
of
which
will
be
subject
to
the
restriction
against
race
that
is
created
for
this
entire
suburban
community.
in
burton
v.
wilmington
parking
authority
in
1961,
the
court
in
viewing
all
of
the
circumstances
of
the
financing
and
construction
of
a
parking
lot
in
wilmington
and
the
provision
thereof
--
by
lease
from
an
estate
of
a
private
restaurant,
held
that
the
state
was
involved
in
the
discrimination.
even
though
the
restaurant
there
under
those
circumstances
was
operated
and
maintained
by
private
company
and
in
perhaps
the
most
important
and
closely
relevant
case,
in
marsh
v.
alabama
in
1946,
the
supreme
court
held
that
a
company
town,
which
was
owned
by
gulf
shipbuilding
corporation,
built
presumably
for
furthering
the
purposes
of
that
corporation
in
building
ships,
could
not
limit
the
exercise
of
constitutional
rights
within
that
town
merely
because
of
the
combination
of
property
interest
that
it
there
owned.
far
less
extensive,
in
our
present
environment
is
the
company
town
compared
to
the
subdivision
developments
with
which
we're
here
confronted
which
make
up
perhaps
most
of
new
suburbia
which
surrounds
our
central
city
ghettos
where
so
many
of
our
minorities
are
confined
and
unable
regardless
of
their
economic
ability
to
break
loose.
the
pattern
of
segregation
created
in
these
subdivisions
will
have
exactly
the
same
effect
that
it
would
have
if
they
were
created
by
act
of
a
legislature
or
by
act
of
a
city
council.
in
regardless
of
the
ownership
of
the
property
involved,
the
public
interest
must
be
identical.
here,
paddock
woods
is
legally
indistinguishable
from
the
company
of
town
in
chickasaw,
alabama.
it
has
to
go
to
government,
the
county
government
of
saint
louis,
the
state
government
of
missouri
for
all
of
its
powers.
it
could
not
provide
what
it
provides
for
the
people
without
the
approval,
without
the
responsibility
of
state
government
in
doing
so.
it
must
provide
to
the
people
their
streets,
sidewalks,
water,
sewage,
park
facilities
as
indicated.
it
has
the
power
under
municipal
ordinance
of
the
county
of
saint
louis
to
provide
the
zoning
restrictions
through
deeds
of
record.
and
the
nature
of
these
restrictions
by
usage,
and
as
can
be
seen
from
the
ordinance
itself,
go
even
to
noxious
conduct
of
the
people
resident
in
the
area.
mr.
clark
the
--
the
authority
for
--
no,
the
authority
for
this
is
to
provide
the
opportunity
for
the
people
within
this
area
to
the
--
let
me
put
this
way
the
--
mr.
clark
yes,
that's
correct
and
that's
for
necessary
improvements
--
mr.
clark
that's
for
necessary
improvements
or
work
done
for
the
community.
mr.
clark
paddock
woods
can
repair
the
streets,
they
can
beautify
park,
they
can
put
in
trees
along
the
streets,
they
can
lay
new
sidewalks
out
and
they
can
assess
the
property
owners
to
pay
for
the
cost
of
it.
mr.
clark
and
that's
--
mr.
clark
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
the
purpose
here
goes
beyond
the
mere
creation
of
the
community.
it
goes
on
to
the
continuing
service.
the
basic
powers
of
zoning
that
i
--
that
i
described
are
set
out
in
page
82
of
the
government's
brief
where
the
municipal
ordinance
1005.130
is
set
forth.
and
it
provides
--
mr.
clark
it
begins
on
page
82
and
goes
onto
page
83.
mr.
clark
it
provides
the
powers
of
subdivision,
allowed
to
subdivide
--
or
divider
--
free
in
the
arrangement
of
streets
and
lots,
at
the
same
time
protect
the
convenience,
health,
welfare
and
safety
of
the
probable
feature
residents
of
the
subdivisions
as
well
as
the
character
of
the
surrounding
property
and
the
general
welfare
of
the
entire
area.
and
the
practices
under
that
are
set
out
back
in
about
page
17
of
our
brief
which
includes
the
placement
of
temporary
structures
on
property,
the
prevention
of
using
property
for
commercial
purposes,
and
the
control
of
obnoxious
personal
activities
of
individuals.
mr.
clark
it's
for
that
purpose
mr.
chief
justice
as
well
as
for
--
this
is
a
non-incorporated
area.
it's
for
purposes
of
saying
that
the
other
--
properties
are
not
damaged
by
the
use
to
which
this
property
is
put.
paddock
woods
qualifies
as
a
city
of
the
fourth
class
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
missouri
and
it
could,
if
it
chose,
to
be
a
city
of
the
fourth
class
under
those
laws
and
engaged
in
the
same
activities
as
a
city
of
the
fourth
class
rather
than
as
a
private
corporation.
mr.
clark
yes,
sir,
that's
it.
the
preceding
part
is
--
mr.
clark
the
other
end
point
here
too.
mr.
clark
this
section
is
the
same
section
that
i
refer
to
in
page
82
and
83
of
the
appendix
to
this
brief.
the
court
held
in
marsh
v.
alabama
that
a
jehovah's
witness
could
not
be
prohibited
because
of
the
equal
protection
clause
for
the
fourteenth
amendment
from
going
into
a
company
town
that
was
concededly
private
property
from
going
on
the
sidewalks
there
and
endeavoring
to
communicate
with
the
people
who
live
there.
and
if
--
and
the
court
held
that
the
mere
fact
that
this
was
private
property
that
this
is
a
company
of
town
or
rather
than
ordinary
city
could
not
deprive
the
inhabitants
there
of
their
constitutional
rights
to
this
sort
of
communications
or
the
rights
of
people
who
did
not
live
there
to
come
there
and
so
communicate.
it
would
seem
ironic
indeed
if
this
communication
could
not
be
prohibited,
this
casual
itenerant
communication,
but
that
the
very
right,
the
fundamental
right
to
live
there,
to
buy
there,
to
own
property
there
could
be
prohibited
as
to
the
whole
area
fencing
out
an
entire
race.
this
would
seem
to
me
that
if
its
government
action
within
the
limits
of
the
property
of
the
company
town
in
chickasaw,
alabama,
for
purposes
of
jehovah's
witnesses
coming
on
the
sidewalks
that
are
private
property,
then
it
must
be
government
action
also
for
that
corporation
and
the
disposition
of
its
property
when
it
endeavors
to
restrict
its
sales
to
people
of
the
white
race.
the
activities
of
the
city
in
marsh
v.
alabama
are
not
essentially
different
from
the
activities
of
this
suburban
community.
here,
fire
protection
has
to
be
provided.
here
streets
and
all
the
utilities
had
to
be
laid
out.
here,
the
purpose
was
to
dispose
a
property
but
they
have
an
ongoing
entity
for
its
regulation,
for
its
use,
and
for
its
enjoyment
and
that
by
definition
almost,
must
be
government
action.
we
would
urge
to
the
court
to
hold
that
when
a
subdivision
in
a
community
involving
these
many
people,
alleged
to
be
a
thousand
people
in
paddock
woods
alone,
in
a
total
development
of
2,700
families
endeavors
to
screen
out,
to
fence
out
all
negroes
that
it
is
denying
equal
protection
of
the
laws
in
a
fundamentally
governmental
activity
violating
constitutional
rights
of
the
person
so-discriminated
against.
the
statute
itself,
section
1978
is
in
the
broadest
of
language.
it
is
clearly
language
that
is
supportable
by
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
language
designed
to
prevent
the
discrimination
against
negroes,
and
the
sale
and
the
use
and
the
disposition
of
property,
and
if
they
can
be
screened
out
from
the
whole
area
here,
a
whole
community
involving
hundreds
of
families,
then
clearly
they
are
denied
the
rights
the
statute
was
designed
to
protect.
the
fact
that
the
statute
played
partially
dormant
for
many
years,
it
cannot
be
held
to
diminish
its
force
today
any
more
than
sections
241
and
242,
enacted
shortly
after
this
were
diminished.
when
it
first
came
before
the
court
in
u.s.
v.
classic
after
75
years
of
virtual
dormancy,
the
statute
is
vital
and
it's
important.
there
is
before
the
congress,
as
the
court
knows,
legislation
that
would
provide
open
housing
rights
on
a
complicated
statutory
scheme
including
administrative
judicial
and
other
sanctions
for
its
effectuation.
mr.
clark
its
potential
for
effectiveness
is
probably
much
greater
than
1978
because
of
the
sanctions
and
the
remedies
that
it
provides.
it
approaches
the
securing
of
these
rights
on
a
graduated
basis.
in
its
ultimate
reach,
it
has
three
exceptions;
single-family
dwellings
and
mrs.
murphy
situation
where
there
is
a
unit
with
more
than
four
different
families
living
within
it
and
religious
club
uses.
mr.
clark
which
exceptions
that
are
not
in
1978,
but
it
would
depend
on
how
you
interpreted
1978.
mr.
clark
it
would
be
if
--
it
would
depend
upon
the
form.
the
--
the
bill
that
passed
the
senate
would
provide
some
relief
for
these
petitioners
if
it
became
law
as
of
december
31,
1968.
it
would
not
seem
that
it
would
provide
anything
like
all
of
the
relief
that
they
are
entitled
to.
they
first
sought
a
home
beginning
in
february
1965,
a
first
endeavor
to
buy
a
particular
home
in
paddock
woods
in
june
of
1965.
it
is
most
probable
that
property
values
have
increased
substantially
there
and
perhaps
the
people
here
from
saint
louis
can
tell
you
more
about
that.
there
has
been
a
loss
of
time
and
there
have
been
other
damages
arising
to
the
petitioner
here
that
cannot
be
fully
atoned
for
by
any
new
federal
legislation.
mr.
clark
the
--
mr.
clark
it's
a
--
mr.
clark
that's
one
of
the
basis
also,
the
commerce
clause
and
--
mr.
clark
--
our
testimony,
we
put
it
on
both
--
mr.
clark
no,
i
would
assume
that
1978
would
stand
independently,
i
would
assume
as
practical
matter,
the
executive
branch
would
move
to
enforce
the
new
statute,
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
has
substantial
powers
there
even
though
they're
maybe
primarily
in
the
area
of
conciliation.
mr.
clark
we
don't
know
whether
1978
would
reach
the
single
family
dwelling
or
not.
the
court
doesn't
have
to
hold
that
here
and
a
court
has
not
at
this
time
held
that.
mr.
clark
i'd
say
it
depend
upon
the
interpretation
that
the
court
placed
on
the
statute.
although,
the
language
is
very
broad,
it
does
not
necessarily
have
to
be
construed
as
reaching
--
the
concern
is
not
before
this
court,
whether
it
would
reach
the
single-family
sale.
as
a
matter
of
proof
--
mr.
clark
--
those
cases
are
very
difficult
too
because
there
are
many
reasons
that
you
can
engage
in
a
single
sale
that
do
not
necessarily
relate
--
in
relation
with
race,
it
would
exclude
race.
mr.
clark
well,
it
would
be
up
to
the
next
case
to
determine
whether
the
court
in
this
case
held.
mr.
clark
the
theories
could
be
several
and
it
would
just
whether
1978
involves
substantial
discriminations,
whether
are
single
transaction
among
private
parties
--
mr.
clark
that's
--
mr.
clark
i
think
the
best
reading
of
the
statute
would
to
be
to
include
single-family
housing.
it
might
not
necessarily
cover
isolated
sales
however.
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
apply
to
isolated
sales
to
show
intent
among
other
things.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
