justice
abe
fortas
i
gather
that
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is
that
when
it
was
reenacted
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
by
that
process
it
became
operative
only
where
the
state
action,
is
that
the
argument?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
that's
all
i'm
saying.
that
is
the
argument,
isn't
it
on
the
other
side?
justice
abe
fortas
on
the
question
of
state
action,
may
i
ask
you
whether
the
record
shows
whether
this
land
was
zoned
or
a
rezoned
specifically
for
the
purpose
of
this
development?
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
customary
i
think,
usually
a
tract
of
land
large
enough
for
development
of
this
source
has
to
be
initially
zoned
or
has
been
zoned
and
then
has
to
be
a
rezoned
to
permit
this
to
take
place,
is
that
your
understanding?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
you
would
assume
that
this
was
zoned
specifically
for
this
purpose?
justice
abe
fortas
i
seem
to
recall
reading
that
it
is
stipulated
that
there
was
no
federal
or
estate
mortgage
money
here
or
guarantees.
justice
abe
fortas
then
he
--
there
such
point
that
there
would
be
a
federal
lending
function
here
but
it
would
operate
at
the
level
of
the
buyers.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
that
would
be
extraordinary
if
that
were
not
so,
these
days?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
was
that
addressed
to
this
specific
section
as
to
1982
or
to
other
parts
of
the
bill
than
before
the
congress?
justice
abe
fortas
was
that
remark
addressed
to
this
specific
section
which
we
now
call
1982
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
or
was
it
addressed
to
the
statute
as
a
whole
--
bill
as
whole
or
to
other
parts
of
it?
i
know
for
example
that
there's
a
reference
in
the
preceding
sentence
that
you
have
quoted
in
your
brief
to
the
words
under
color
of
law.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
those
words
don't
appear,
do
they
in
1982?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it
maybe
a
critical
question
because
the
legislative
material
that
you
are
using
in
your
brief
may
apply
to
1982
or
may
apply
to
other
provisions
of
the
bill.
that's
what
makes
this
inquiry
so
difficult
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
so
confusing.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
mean
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
who
kept
them
off
the
street
in
marsh?
justice
abe
fortas
i
gather
that
the
argument

side
