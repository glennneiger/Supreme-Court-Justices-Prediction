mr.
israel
treiman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
a
--
so
we've
got
seven
minutes
left.
i
don't
know
just
where
to
begin
with.
the
court
has
already
touched
through
its
questioning
on
what
i
believe
are
some
of
the
most
sensitive
areas
in
this
entire
case
especially
the
questions
directed
by
mr.
justice
white
at
the
very
end
which
i
think
clearly
indicate
the
profound
complications
and
the
very
troublesome
problems
and
difficulties
that
will
arise
inevitably
if
this
court
should
construe
section
1982
as
the
petitioners
and
the
government
and
the
amici
wanted
to.
i,
speaking
of
the
amici,
may
it
please
the
court
in
the
few
minutes
that
i
have
left,
i
should
like
to
make
few
general
observations
as
your
honors
have
probably
observed.
there
are
great
many
amici
briefs
that
have
been
filed
in
this
case
in
support
of
the
petitioners
and
i
must
confess
that
when
these
briefs
started
coming
to
my
office
i
was
not
a
little
shaken.
and
it
wasn't
--
it
wasn't
because
--
i
was
disturbed
over
the
fact
that
with
all
these
many
organizations
and
fine
lawyers
on
one
side,
i
was
being
left
in
a
somewhat
friendless
position
in
this
courtroom.
i've
become
sort
of
accustomed
to
that
back
home
where
even
some
of
my
good
friends
were
beginning
to
look
upon
me
as
if
i
had
suddenly
become
afflicted
with
leprosy.
what
disturbed
me,
may
it
please
the
court,
what
gave
me
real
concern
was
how
i
was
suppose
to
deal
with
all
of
these
good
briefs
and
they
are
excellent
briefs
especially
the
two
that
have
been
mentioned
here.
the
--
i'm
talking
now
but
the
amici
briefs,
one
by
the
government
and
the
other
by
group
of
national
organizations
headed
by
one
that
calls
itself
the
national
committee
against
discrimination
in
housing,
which
i
shall
refer
to
as
i
have
in
my
brief
as
the
ncadh
brief.
and
speaking
of
that
brief,
may
it
please
the
court,
with
reference
to
the
statements
made
by
the
honorable
attorney
general,
in
regard
to
the
effect
that
segregation,
racial
segregation
has
had
upon
the
life
of
our
country,
i
want
to
say
here
and
now,
personally
i
bow
to
nobody
when
it
comes
to
concern
over
the
plight
of
the
disadvantaged
negro
family.
and
may
i
have
this,
i
have
read
many
articles
and
books
on
this
subject,
but
as
i
told
the
person
who
i
believe
was
the
principal
writer
of
the
ncadh
brief,
i
have
now
seen
anywhere
a
more
powerful,
a
more
eloquent
description
of
the
terrible
--
the
terrible
condition
in
plight
in
which
not
only
the
children
but
the
adults
of
the
negro
families
find
themselves
by
reason
of
their
difficulty
in
obtaining
decent
housing.
so
that
as
to
that
part
of
the
attorney
general's
argument,
as
far
as
that
part
is
concern,
i
assure
the
court
that
i
do
not
quarrel
either
with
the
attorney
general
or
with
any
of
these
good
friends
of
the
court
who
come
into
this
case.
what
disturbs
me,
your
honors,
is
the
way
in
which
they
think
this
problem
should
be
solved.
and
i
must
say,
since
i
will
have
only
a
minute,
as
i
came
into
the
courtroom
this
morning
for
the
first
time,
i
saw
the
words
that
are
inscribed
over
the
portals
of
this
courthouse
“equal
justice
under
law.”
i
must
confess
my
ignorance,
i
did
not
know
those
words
were
there.
and
it
struck
me
that
this
perhaps
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
this
case
surely
nobody
would
deny
equal
justice
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
under
section
1982.
but
the
other
two
words
are
just
as
important,
it
seems
to
me.
it
must
be
under
law.
i
happen
to
be
a
practicing
lawyer
back
home
and
not
a
lawyer
who
assure
you,
your
honors,
professors
to
have
any
great
knowledge
about
constitutional
law.
i
happen
to
be
what
people
referred
to
as
the
bread
and
butter
type
of
practicing
lawyer.
and
while
i
have
that
deep
sympathy
for
the
conditions
that
have
been
described
caused
by
the
acute
problems
of
housing,
i
am
also
a
practicing
lawyer.
i
have
an
equal
reverence
for
the
orderliness
of
the
law.
and
i
believe
your
honors
that
if
we
are
to
meet
this
problem,
let
us
meet
it
in
a
way
that
it's
provided
for
under
our
constitution
and
under
our
philosophy
of
the
meaning
of
law.
it's
2:30
and
if
i
may
i
should
like
to
close
and
reserve
my
time
unless
the
court
wishes
to
ask
me
questions.
mr.
israel
treiman
thank
you.
mr.
israel
treiman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
pass
now
as
quickly
as
possible
to
what
i
regard
as
the
pivotal
points
of
this
case.
and
i
should
like
to
consider
those
points
in
two
categories
corresponding
to
the
two
grounds
on
which
the
petitioners
and
the
major
briefs,
that
is
the
government
brief
and
the
ncadh
brief,
and
i
must
say
two
or
three
others,
claimed
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
dismissing
the
claim.
and
that
the
petitioners
are
entitled
to
recover
on
the
basis
of
the
allegations
set
forth
in
their
complaint.
now,
taking
up
the
first
claim,
the
first
ground,
which
has
to
do
with
this
civil
rights
act
of
1866
or
rather
that
portion
of
it
which
appears
today
in
section
1982
of
title
42
of
united
states
code
which
incidentally
the
government
and
its
brief
refers
to
by
its
revised
statute
designation
of
section
1978.
here,
your
honors,
we
deal
with
a
question
of
pure
statutory
construction.
and
i
should
like
to
emphasize
that,
particularly
in
view
of
the
question
that
i
believe
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
of
counsel
for
the
petitioners
yesterday.
mr.
justice
fortas,
as
i
recall
asked
counsel
who
was
then
discussing,
i
believe
the
constitutionality
of
this
section
under
the
thirteenth
amendment
whether
one
could
not
presume
that
the
respondents
would
take
the
position
that
this
section
owe
its
constitution
of
validity
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
rather
than
the
thirteenth.
and
as
i
recall,
counsel
for
the
petitioners
and
i'm
sure
there
was
no
intention
or
whatsoever
on
his
part
to
put
the
respondent
in
an
incorrect
position
or
mislead
the
court.
counsel
for
the
petitioners
said,
yes,
he
would
presume
that
our
position
would
be,
that
this
section
owes
its
life,
owes
its
constitutional
life,
you
might
say
to
the
fourteenth
rather
than
the
thirteenth
amendment.
it
seems
therefore
that
the
repetition
on
the
emphasis
with
which
i
thought,
i
had
made
it
clear
in
my
brief
that
we
were
not
concerned
with
the
constitutionality
of
this
section.
that
therefore
it
mattered
not
to
us
whether
it
should
be
regarded
as
rooted
in
the
thirteenth
amendment
or
the
fourteenth
amendment,
escaped
the
attention
of
counsel
for
the
petitioners.
but,
as
your
honors
will
recall
in
connection
with
another
question
counsel
for
the
petitioners
did
say
that
we
had
conceded
the
constitutionality
of
this
civil
rights
act
which
is
true.
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
in
our
brief,
we
open
up
by
saying
that
one
of
the
three
questions
which
the
petitioners
present
as
questions
presented
in
this
case
maybe
eliminated.
and
that
question
in
the
petitioner's
brief
was
whether
the
--
whether
section
1982
is
constitutional.
we
are
not
questioning
the
constitutionality
of
that
section.
what
are
we
questioning
then?
we're
questioning
the
meaning
of
that
section.
it
is
no
matter
of
congressional
power.
but
at
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
or
the
fourteenth
or
any
other
provision
of
the
constitution,
it
isn't
a
question
of
whether
had
congress
in
1866
passed
an
act
which
was
directed
against
individual
conduct
whether
congress
thereby
was
exercising
a
valid
power
either
under
the
thirteenth
or
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
incidentally
maybe
a
question
that
will
be
raised
if
congress
should
pass
a
fair
housing
bill,
of
course,
because
under
your
customary
fair
housing
bill,
it's
the
individual
owner
or
seller
who
is
prohibited
from
discriminating
of
that
may
raise
a
question
as
to
whether
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
the
enabling
section
or
section
2
of
the
thirteenth
amendment.
congress
has
the
power
to
enact
legislation
of
this
kind.
that
is
not
the
question
here.
so,
i
come
to
what
i
think
is
the
crucial
question.
with
respect
to
this
statute
that
has
been
made
so
mush
of
that
the
honorable
attorney
general
relied
so
heavily
on
yesterday.
this
statute
has
some
very
simple
words,
i
think.
it's
a
question
what
those
words
mean.
and
if
you
kept
down
to
what
i
think
are
the
key
words,
what
are
they?
it
says,
“every
person
shall
have
the
same
right
to
buy
property
as
is
enjoyed
by
white
citizens”.
what
does
that
mean?
what
does
the
word
“right”
in
that
sentence
mean?
does
it
mean
right
in
the
sense
of
legal
ability,
legal
competence
to
buy,
own,
and
incidentally
inherit?
that
word
is
also
used
in
the
statute;
property
and
self
property.
or
does
it
mean
something
more
than
that?
doesn't
mean
something
that
is
not
so
much
related
to
the
status
of
the
--
or
the
position
of
the
buyer
as
it
is
to
the
seller,
to
the
conduct
of
a
seller,
something
that
is
not
just
a
matter
of
right
but
of
matter
of
duty,
a
duty
imposed
upon
the
seller.
mr.
israel
treiman
1982
your
honor.
mr.
israel
treiman
1982
which
is
the
section
involved
here
or
1978
of
the
revised
statutes.
that
is
a
portion
by
the
way,
a
portion
of
the
original
civil
rights
act.
you'll
find
that
portion
in
the
first
section
of
the
original
act
which
had
a
number
of
sections
in
it.
well
now
the
petitioners
in
this
case
claimed
that
this
section
is
directed
and
was
intended
to
be
directed
against
the
seller.
that
it
didn't
simply
mean
right
in
the
sense
of
right
by
law
legal
competence.
and
in
order
to
prove
--
we
of
course
take
the
position
that
this
section
should
be
construed
as
being
in
confined
to
laws
or
official
action
of
some
kind
which
say
that
a
negro
shall
not
have
the
same
right
as
a
white
citizen.
and
it
was
--
it
cannot
be
and
should
not
be
construed
as
being
aimed,
that
individual,
the
individual
behavior
of
a
seller.
now
in
order
to
prove
that
its
construction
is
correct,
the
petitioners
and
the
writers
of
the
ncadh
brief,
ncadh
brief
and
that
particularly
the
government,
i
say
particularly
the
government
for
a
reason
which
i'll
mention
shortly,
insist
on
taking
us
back
to
the
year
1866,
to
the
early
part
of
the
year
1866,
on
the
39th
congress
enacted
this
section.
and
i
must
say,
your
honors,
that
when
i
saw
in
the
government's
brief,
the
historical
materials,
the
--
not
secondary
but
primary
source
materials
on
which
apparently
the
government
claimed
its
construction
would
be
justified.
i
shuddered
a
little
bit
because
it
meant
that
i
would
have
to
indulge
in
some
historical
research.
and
i
do
not
profess
to
be
expert
in
delving
into
historical
materials
but
i
felt
that
as
a
lawyer,
and
especially
since
the
government
gave
me
the
specific
leads,
it
blueprinted
these
sources
specifically
the
materials
which
it
said
would
prove
that
that
was
the
intention
of
congress
in
1866,
and
so
i
went
to
these
sources.
now,
what
were
they?
now,
i'll
make
this
as
brief
as
possible.
the
government
claims
that
if
you
consult
the
statements,
the
speeches
made
in
congress,
the
39th
congress,
the
speeches
of
the
sponsors
of
this
section
--
of
this
act
of
1866,
the
speeches
of
the
opponents
of
the
act,
and
one
other
statement,
the
statement
of
president
andrew
johnson,
when
he
vetoed
this
bill,
the
reasons
that
he
gave
for
vetoing
the
bill.
you
will
find
says
the
government
that
the
bill
must
have
been
intended
to
be
directed
against
individual
action.
i
must
say
since
i
mentioned
president
johnson's
veto
message
in
order
that
the
court
may
follow
me
in
connection
with
another
matter
which
i
shall
presently
mention,
a
very
important
matter
which
does
involved
a
matter
of
comparing
dates.
this
act
of
1866
was
first
enacted
on
march
13,
1866.
president
johnson
vetoed.
it
was
then
reenacted
over
the
president's
veto
on
april
9,
which
is
a
date
usually
given
as
a
date
of
enactment
of
this
act
of
1866.
now,
i
went
into
the
statements,
the
speeches
made
in
the
congressional
record.
the
references
are
all
given
in
the
government's
brief.
it
was
not
known
by
the
way
as
a
congressional
record
that
--
yes,
they
seemed
congressional
globe.
and
i
took
the
statements
of
the
chairman
of
the
judiciary
committee
of
the
house
of
the
senate.
and
i
took
the
statements,
the
speeches;
i
read
them
all,
of
the
sponsors
of
the
bill,
the
people
who
supported
the
bills
in
both
bodies
of
congress.
i
then
went
to
the
opponents
of
the
bill
and
i
got
their
statements.
and
i
have
set
forth
in
my
brief,
department
passages
from
the
statements
of
all
of
those
congressmen.
and
then
i
went
to
president
johnson's
veto
message.
and
i
have
set
forth
in
my
brief
the
pertinent
passage
from
his
message.
all
of
which
i
submit
your
honors
overwhelmingly,
convincingly,
proved
that
the
bill
was
never
intended.
this
civil
rights
act
of
1866
was
never
intended
to
be
directed
at
anything
but
laws,
legislation.
and
then
i
went
to
the
other
sources,
the
second
source
that
the
government
set,
the
second
document
on
which
it
said
it
would
be
--
could
be
shown
that
this
bill
was
intended
not
to
be
directed
against
discriminatory
laws
but
individual
conduct
and
what
was
that?
now,
this
is
quite
interesting.
the
government
says
that
there
are
two
documents,
a
senate
executive
document
and
a
house
executive
document,
which
will
prove
that
in
all
of
the
black
codes
that
were
enacted
after
the
civil
war,
some
of
them
maybe
before.
by
the
time
congress
got
to
deliberating
on
this
act,
all
disqualification
of
negroes
to
own
property
had
been
removed.
now,
this
is
quite
a
statement.
it's
in
the
government's
brief.
i
think
it
reads
--
it
appears
that
in
none
of
the
black
codes
in
the
early
part
of
1966
was
there
any
disqualification
left
to
the
negro
from
owning
property?
i
then
went
to
these
two
documents
and
what
were
they?
both
of
these
documents
contained,
each
contains
a
report.
a
report
prepared
by
the
then
secretary
of
state
mr.
stewart
under
the
direction
of
president
johnson
for
submission
to
congress.
so
that
congress
would
know
what
was
going
on
so
far
as
discriminatory
legislation
was
concerned,
discriminatory
as
against
the
negro
of
course.
and
what
does
the
report
say?
i
must
say
i
was
dismayed
of
what
i
found
in
the
light
of
what
the
government
asserts.
i
found
that
according
to
that
report
which
incidentally
your
honors
adheres
where
that
date
becomes
important
in
connection
with
the
date
of
the
passage
of
this
bill.
this
report
is
dated
may
22,
1966,
which
was
after
the
originally
enactment
of
the
bill
as
well
as
its
reenactment
following
president
johnson's
veto.
it
says
that
in
all
--
it
let
--
it
reviews
a
number
of
the
southern
states.
and
it
says
that
in
all
of
those
states
with
two
exceptions,
the
disqualifications
of
the
negroes
still
remain.
it
points
it
out
very
clearly
and
i
will
presently
show
how.
apparently,
what
happened
was
and
in
each
of
these
states,
a
state
convention
was
called,
as
this
is
of
course
familiar
post
civil
war
history.
a
state
convention
was
called
by
the
provincial
governor
of
the
state
appointed
by
president
johnson,
andrew
johnson.
the
convention
was
called
and
of
course
it
was
completely
dominated
by
the
northerners
and
their
southern
sympathizers.
and
so,
there
was
no
difficulty
whatsoever
in
getting
resolutions
adopted
that
would
be
in
line
with
northern
feelings.
in
each
of
these
states
says
this
report,
in
each
of
these
states,
first,
there
was
a
resolution
adopted,
proclaiming
that
there
would
be
no
more
slavery
in
that
state.
then
it
was
followed
in
--
i
think
every
case
by
another
resolution.
and
that
second
resolution
called
upon
the
chairman
of
the
convention
to
appoint
a
committee
or
a
commission
that
would
come
in
with
a
set
of
recommended
laws,
revisions
of
the
then
existing
state
laws
in
order
to
bring
the
state
laws
into
conformity
with
the
thirteenth
amendment,
with
the
emancipation
situation.
and
what
happened?
according
to
this
report,
most
of
these
cases
such
a
committee
was
appointed.
in
several
of
the
cases,
several
of
the
states,
the
committee
actually
went
to
work.
and
there
is
set
forth
in
the
report
a
set
of
statutes
in
which,
of
course,
all
disqualification
of
the
negro
was
eliminated.
but
this
was
a
set
of
statutes
which
the
committee,
the
commission,
and
the
convention
resolved,
should
be
recommended
for
enactment
by
the
local
legislature.
except
in
two
cases,
texas
and
georgia
as
of
the
date
of
this
report,
no
such
legislation
has
yet
been
enacted.
and
interestingly
enough,
even
in
texas
and
georgia
which
had
changed
their
laws
and
had
removed
disqualification.
when
did
that
take
place?
not
before
this
bill
was
passed.
in
one
case
it
took
place
several
weeks
but
in
both
cases,
it
took
place
after
the
first
enactment
of
the
bill.
and
in
one
case,
it
took
place
before
its
reenactment
but
certainly
after
the
originally
enactment
of
this
bill.
for
the
government
therefore
to
say
that
when
congress
was
debating,
considering
this
bill,
there
was
no
need
to
do
anything
about
discriminatory
laws
from
these
black
codes
to
me
is
astonishing.
it's
contradicted
by
the
evidence
i
submit.
and
furthermore,
your
honors,
if
you
want
what
i
say
in
my
brief,
it's
probably
the
best
succinct
piece
of
evidence
on
that
point
that
you
would
want.
it's
that
of
justice
wayne
who
in
that
very
year
was
deciding
the
case
sitting
as
a
circuit
justice.
he
was
deciding
the
case
of
u.s.
versus
rhodes.
and
in
the
course
of
his
opinion,
he
makes
the
statement,
i
quote
it
in
my
brief,
that
as
soon
as
the
thirteenth
amendment
was
passed,
there
begun
a
course
of
legislative
oppression,
legislative
oppression
through
this
black
codes
of
course.
and
that
this
statute
obviously,
i
don't
know
whether
to
use
the
word
“obviously
or
undoubtedly”,
was
enacted
to
curve
that
course
of
legislative
oppression.
there
you
have
the
real
purpose
of
the
statute.
law,
discriminatory
law
is
not
an
individual
conduct.
now,
passing
from
the
context,
the
setting
in
which
the
act
was
enacted,
i'm
looking
at
what's
happened
to
this
act.
after
all
it's
over
a
hundred
years,
this
act
has
been
existence.
the
natural
question
is,
why
hasn't
it
been
used
before
in
a
situation
of
this
kind?
why
hasn't
it
used
before
in
a
situation
where
a
discriminatory
law
was
not
involved
but
discriminatory
conduct?
mr.
israel
treiman
set
forth
in
my
brief,
your
honor
the
--
mr.
israel
treiman
would
you
like
for
me
to
read
it?
mr.
israel
treiman
they
--
mr.
israel
treiman
specifically
--
mr.
israel
treiman
specifically,
in
fact
--
mr.
israel
treiman
--
the
times
they
were
asked.
are
you
intending
to
go
into
our
states
and
make
a
criminal
code
directed
against
individuals
and
the
answer
was
no,
not
at
all.
in
those
states
where
your
laws
do
not
disqualify
this
statute
will
have
no
effect.
specifically,
they
say
that.
and
i
have
the
quotations
in
my
brief.
and
i
have
those
particular
passages
in
bold
type
about
eight
-10
pages
of
it.
mr.
israel
treiman
yes,
yes.
the
government
says
that
--
mr.
israel
treiman
well,
but
the
point
is
that
--
mr.
israel
treiman
to
have
what?
mr.
israel
treiman
that's
right.
and
as
i
see
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
government
says,
well,
that
word
“right”
means
--
i
think
that
is
mr.
liberman
said
yesterday
has
to
do
with
the
extension
which
you
can
enjoy
the
right.
it
isn't
only
a
matter
of
legal
right
of
right
by
law.
it's
a
matter
of
whether
you
can
get
somebody
else,
an
unwilling
seller
whether
you
can
compel
him
to
sell
to
you
because
he
is
willing
to
sell
it
to
somebody
else
who
is
not
a
negro.
so
it's
a
question
of
whether
this
statute
is
directed
against
laws
only
--
mr.
israel
treiman
i
think
so
your
honor,
and
i
have
this
passages
--
mr.
israel
treiman
yes,
yes.
mr.
israel
treiman
i'll
see
if
i
can
get
it
immediately.
mr.
israel
treiman
pardon?
mr.
israel
treiman
yes.
mr.
israel
treiman
yes,
the
part
in
bold
type.
in
an
--
if
an
offense
is
committed
against
a
colored
person
simply
because
he
is
colored
in
a
state
where
the
law
affords
him
the
same
protection
as
if
he
were
white,
this
act
neither
has
no
--
or
was
intended
to
have
anything
to
do
with
this
case.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
didn't
get
your
question
mr.
justice.
mr.
israel
treiman
it
wasn't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
israel
treiman
yes.
mr.
israel
treiman
that
question
is
not
easy
to
answer,
mr.
justice
fortas
because
--
mr.
israel
treiman
i
agree.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
agree,
i
cannot
say
confidently
that
the
congressman
who
made
that
statement
had
in
mind
only
that
portion
of
it
which
is
today
1982
or
other
portions.
and
i'm
well
aware
mr.
justice
fortas
that
the
phrase
under
color
of
law
appears
in
another
part
of
the
act,
yes.
mr.
israel
treiman
on
page
15.
in
the
statement
of
representative
wilson,
if
the
states
would
all
observe
the
rights
of
our
citizens,
there
would
be
no
need
of
this
bill.
and
then
later
on
he
speaks
of
laws
barbaric,
nothing
said
about
individual
conduct.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
believe
he
was
but
after
all,
that
bill
included
this
section.
mr.
israel
treiman
in
effect
i
suppose
it
would
be
so
far
as
this
section
is
concerned.
now
that
--
not
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
mr.
israel
treiman
yes.
mr.
israel
treiman
laws,
ordinances,
official
regulations,
official
conduct,
yes.
mr.
israel
treiman
black
codes
--
mr.
israel
treiman
black
codes
that
had
disqualifications
and
some
of
the
black
codes
did
not,
yes,
yes.
in
fact
i
think
that's
--
mr.
israel
treiman
well,
i
would
say
that
an
action
under
that
law
would
not
be
possible
in
a
state
that
has
no
discriminatory
laws,
yes.
that's
it
precisely.
mr.
israel
treiman
yes?
mr.
israel
treiman
in
the
sense
of
a
law.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
would
think
if
there
are
no
laws,
no
regulations,
there
would
be
no
action
under
this,
under
this
particular
--
mr.
israel
treiman
(inaudible)
mr.
israel
treiman
well,
there
are
--
mr.
israel
treiman
does
it
change
the
language?
mr.
israel
treiman
but
where
the
protection
is
not
actually
enforced
because
some
individuals
choose
to
be
discriminatory.
mr.
israel
treiman
is
that
what
you
mean?
mr.
israel
treiman
yes.
well,
i
would
say
that's
right.
i
would
say
he'd
have
to
go
elsewhere
for
his
remedy
but
not
under
this
section.
mr.
israel
treiman
it's
a
proclamation
of
rights,
your
honor,
as
many
scholars
have
pointed
out
--
mr.
israel
treiman
yes,
yes.
like
some
--
like
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
mr.
israel
treiman
well,
i
believe
that
the
answer
to
that
is
the
same
that
should
be
given
and
i'd
intend
to
give
when
i
discussed
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
its
bare
terms.
mr.
israel
treiman
it
merely
says
--
mr.
israel
treiman
it
merely
says
that
there
is
a
right
not
to
have
a
law.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
would
say
that
the
right
there
and
i
don't
deny,
mr.
justice
black.
we
do
get
into
a
realm
here
that
to
some
extent
may
depend
upon
semantics
upon
the
objective
one
has
in
mind
in
trying
to
interpret
this
section.
i
can
only
go
by
what
the
congressman
said
back
on
those
days
by
what
president
johnson
said
in
his
veto
message
when
he
said
that
in
his
opinion
this
would
change
the
laws
of
the
states.
and
he
didn't
want
congress
to
meddle
with
local
laws.
and
i
would
say
the
same
thing
same
conclusion
must
be
reached
in
reading
justice
wayne's
opinion.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
agree,
of
course
in
those
states
where
they
have
discriminatory
laws.
mr.
israel
treiman
i'm
not
so
sure
i
would
say
it
would
be
automatically
rid
--
gone,
it's
there
hovering
all
the
time
in
the
moment
the
state
does
pass
a
law.
this
is
discriminatory.
that
section
could
be
invoked.
mr.
israel
treiman
only
if
the
state
passes
a
law
in
violation
of
that
section
and
i
might
at
this
point,
your
honor,
perhaps
call
your
attention
to
this
statement
in
--
mr.
israel
treiman
that
would
depend
on
who
the
group
is
--
mr.
israel
treiman
if
the
group
is
in
any
way
financed
by
any
kind
of
state
agency
--
mr.
israel
treiman
if
they
go
to
the
commission,
the
plan
commission
to
get
approval
of
their
subdivision
plan?
mr.
israel
treiman
you
mean
in
the
corporate
purposes,
it
would
be
set
forth
that
they
were
going
to
have
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
israel
treiman
this
would
depend
on
the
attitude
of
the
secretary
of
state
when
he
reads
the
proposed
articles
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
israel
treiman
i
would
say
i
think
you're
getting
pretty
close
to
shelly
versus
kraemer.
you're
getting
pretty
close
to
action
by
an
official.
if
he
approves
articles
within
the
corporation
that
explicitly
state
that
this
will
be
segregated,
yes.
i
would
say
this
is
official
conduct.
it's
giving
the
sanction
of
the
state
to
something
that's
clearly
unconstitutional,
yes
i
would.
mr.
israel
treiman
on
the
basis
of
population,
i
suppose
it
would.
any
group
of
individuals
in
a
certain
area
under
our
state
statutes,
now
i
presume
this
is
true
all
over.
if
they
have
a
certain
number
of
people
can
qualify
for
a
certain
type
of
incorporate
--
mr.
israel
treiman
they
incorporated
--
mr.
israel
treiman
and
it
was
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
israel
treiman
i
would
say
--
mr.
israel
treiman
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
to
me
would
be
as
violative
as
anything
could
possibly
be
because
there
you're
getting
with
a
political
subdivision.
mr.
israel
treiman
would
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
can
answer
that
--
mr.
israel
treiman
the
city
of
the
fourth
class
would
be
a
political
subdivision
of
the
state.
mr.
israel
treiman
it's
a
very
important
difference
i
think,
mr.
justice
marshall,
for
this
reason.
the
city
of
saint
louis
for
example,
could
not
in
selling
any
part
of
its
property
discriminate
--
mr.
israel
treiman
but
a
private
owner
--
mr.
israel
treiman
right,
but
a
private
owner
and
you
yesterday
mentioned
--
mr.
israel
treiman
mr.
justice
marshall,
you
are
now
reaching
the
point
which
i
think
some
of
your
question
yesterday
was
directed
to
and
that
involves
the
case
marsh
versus
alabama.
and
i
am
most
anxious
to
discuss
that
case.
i
had
deferred
it
because
as
i've
said
earlier,
i
want
to
deal
with
these
questions
under
two
categories
and
your
question,
i
--
mr.
israel
treiman
no,
i'll
--
no,
i
--
i
think
i
would
just
assume
mr.
justice
marshall
since
you
are
interested
in
that
point
and
it's
a
tremendously
important
point
and
i
must
say
when
i
read
marsh
versus
alabama
for
the
first
time
in
connection
with
this
case,
i
said
well,
this
is
on
all
fours,
how
can
we
get
around
that
case?
here
is
a
big
community,
not
in
--
not
a
city,
a
company
owned
town.
and
here
was
the
united
states
supreme
court
holding
that
the
fact
that
it
was
all
privately
owned
didn't
settle
the
question.
i
think
that
was
the
expression
used
by
mr.
justice
black
in
his
opinion
in
that
case.
property
rights
do
not
settle
the
question.
now
what
happened
in
that
case?
it
was
a
jehovah's
witness
by
a
name
of
marsh
who
came
under
this
company
owned
town,
i
think
it
was
suburb
of
mobile,
alabama
and
the
--
want
to
distribute
some
religious
literature.
and
the
company
representatives
told
her,
there
was
a
regulation
against
it,
warned
her
to
--
not
to
do
so.
despite
the
warning,
she
continued
to
sell
the
literature.
she
was
arrested
on
a
charged
of
violating
the
local
in
effect
trespass
statute.
she
was
convicted.
she
took
an
appeal
to
this
court.
this
court
held
that
she
was
protected
by
the
constitutional
provision.
this
happened
to
be
the
first
amendment,
but
the
same
point
of
course
would
apply
that
was
within
constitutional
prohibition.
and
you
might
say
therefore,
“well,
doesn't
this
control
this
case?”
not
one
bit
for
this
reason.
and
i
think
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
the
best
way
to
meet
that
case
is
to
consider
a
similar
case
that
arose
two
years
later,
the
watchtower
case
also
involving
jehovah's
witnesses.
now
what
was
the
watchtower?
it
rose
in
new
york.
it
came
however
as
i
should
presently
point
out
to
the
supreme
court
on
request
for
certiorari.
mr.
justice
marshall
since
you
are
interested
in
size,
i
should
like
to
describe
this
residential
community.
it
was
involved
in
a
watchtower
case.
it
was
called
parkchester.
and
it
is
described
this
way.
parkchester
is
a
residential
community
which
is
said
to
be
the
largest
of
its
kind
in
the
world
covering
129
acres
and
housing
12,000
family
units
made
up
of
some
35,000
people
in
171
adjoining
in
interrelated
apartment
building.
and
then
he
was
on
to
say
that
it
has
streets,
and
shops,
and
it's
a
regular
community,
but
all
privately
owned.
and
the
jehovah's
witnesses
came
there,
entered
one
of
these
apartment
buildings
and
then
in
the
hallways
tried
to
distribute
that
literature.
their
attention
was
called
to
the
fact
that
there
was
a
regulation
there
by
the
landlord,
the
owner
of
this
community.
no
distribution
of
literature
in
the
hallways
of
any
department.
where
they're
apparently
relying
on
marsh
versus
alabama
refused
to
abide
instead
of
getting
themselves
arrested
as
i
recall
they
challenged
the
validity
of
that
regulation
in
the
new
york
courts,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
israel
treiman
between
the
hallway?
mr.
israel
treiman
well,
not
inside
the
apartments,
i'm
talking
about
the
hallways.
mr.
israel
treiman
well,
your
honor,
may
i
then
read
to
you
--
mr.
israel
treiman
but
--
mr.
israel
treiman
the
difference
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall
is
this.
what
part
of
this
subdivision
that
we're
talking
about?
if
you're
talking
about
the
lot
in
the
home
that
the
jones'
here
wanted
to
buy
that
in
a
language
of
mr.
justice
black
in
marsh
versus
alabama
was
never
intended
to
be
open
for
general
public
used.
mr.
israel
treiman
this
is
--
mr.
israel
treiman
not
all
responsibility.
not
its
public,
not
those
areas,
the
sidewalks,
the
streets,
the
parks
that
are
opened
up
for
public
use.
and
again
using
the
words
--
mr.
israel
treiman
pardon?
mr.
israel
treiman
not
the
streets,
not
--
yes,
they
could
be
closed
completely
for
certain
purposes
but
not
under
a
discriminatory
basis.
mr.
israel
treiman
to
ne
--
to
white
people
as
well
as
negroes
if
they're
private
streets,
certainly.
mr.
israel
treiman
some
are
private,
yes
and
i'm
glad
you
asked
that
question.
mr.
israel
treiman
oh,
yes,
some
are
private
and
some
are
public.
mr.
israel
treiman
sometimes
you
don't.
into
my
own
subdivision
for
example
--
mr.
israel
treiman
no,
not
necessarily,
they
have
this
wooden
horse
that
at
one
end
they
close
him
up
at
one
end,
i'm
sure
the
same
is
true,
all
of
the
county
in
order
to
keep
him
from
becoming
appropriated
by
the
public
and
keep
it
private.
all
that
privacy
means
really
in
those
cases
is
--
a
subdivision
has
to
maintain
them.
they
would
love
to
dedicate
some
of
these
private
streets
and
get
the
county
or
the
state
to
take
over
the
maintenance.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
concede
the
difference
is
as
to
what
is
involved
here,
i
mean
what
the
discrimination
is
supposed
to
affect.
in
this
case,
it's
supposed
to
affect
a
private
lot,
walks,
an
area
that
was
not
intended
for
public
use,
i
must
come
back
to
mr.
justice
black's
language
in
the
unanimous
opinion
of
the
court
in
the
marsh
case
--
mr.
israel
treiman
not
for
public
use.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
--
was
offered
for
sale
--
mr.
israel
treiman
just
as
any
private
property
might
be
offered
for
sale.
mr.
israel
treiman
yes.
mr.
justice
marshall,
if
i
were
the
owner
--
mr.
israel
treiman
i
most
certainly
do.
i
think
that
the
right
to
buy
and
sell
property,
property
and
as
distinguished
from
its
use.
mr.
israel
treiman
the
right
to
buy
a
property?
mr.
israel
treiman
i
think
under
the
existing
state
of
the
law,
in
the
absence
of
legislation
pursuant
to
either
as
i
say
to
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
section
2
of
the
thirteenth,
i
don't
know
of
any
law
at
the
present
time
that
gives
to
the
buyer
the
right
to
buy
something
from
somebody
who
is
unwilling
to
sell
it
to
him
under
our
existing
law.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
would
say
that
under
the
existing
law
and
i
would
add
unfortunately
i'm
afraid
that
is
so,
mr.
justice
marshall,
until
congress
passes
a
fair
housing
law.
and
this
is
what
disturbs
me.
mr.
justice
fortas
yesterday
--
mr.
israel
treiman
pardon?
mr.
israel
treiman
pardon?
mr.
israel
treiman
your
honor,
it
could
of
course.
and
this
is
what
shocked
me
a
little
bit
yesterday
when
a
question
was
asked
to
the
honorable
attorney
general
about
mr.
justice
white
i
think.
i
think
mr.
justice
white
asked
the
attorney
general,
“well,
wouldn't
our
decision
then
make
unnecessary
a
fair
housing
law?”
and
the
honorable
attorney
general
said,
“no”,
he
didn't
think
so
because
this
decision
would
be
broader
than
a
fair
housing
law
order.
to
me,
the
whole
is
greater
than
of
--
any
of
its
parts.
if
you
go
(inaudible)
as
you
might
say
why
would
you
need?
why
would
you
need
a
narrower
type
of
legislation?
it
would
--
would
it
not
then
--
and
this
--
since
i
started
to
say
is
what
disturbs
me
a
great
deal.
and
i
hope
this
court
will
also
bear
this
in
mind.
i
was
very
much
impressed
yesterday
by
a
reference
of
mr.
justice
fortas
made
to
align
from
oscar
wilde.
we
kill
that
which
we
--
the
thing
we
love.
isn't
--
not
possible
that
trying
to
get
this
court,
the
federal
courts
to
do
something
which
so
many
people
are
asking
congress
to
do
might
in
some
way
--
mr.
israel
treiman
pardon?
mr.
israel
treiman
i
would
rather
not
ask
--
answer
that
question,
your
honor.
it's
not
involved
in
this
case.
and
i
have
not
made
a
sufficient
study.
i
--
mr.
israel
treiman
i
would
say
if
congress
does
pass
such
a
law
to
this,
then
would
be
the
question,
has
congress
--
mr.
israel
treiman
i
--
then
i've
been
misunderstood.
mr.
israel
treiman
well,
it
maybe,
it
maybe
but
i
don't
--
in
this
case
involves
that
question
because
we
have
no
legislation.
we're
dealing
here
with
the
bare
terms
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
used
--
mr.
justice
stewart's
language
in
the
guest
case.
now
if
congress
does
implement
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
passing
some
appropriate
legislation
such
as
the
housing
law,
then
perhaps,
we
have
a
serious
constitutional
question.
i
don't
know.
i
would
think
in
view
of
some
of
the
recent
opinions
of
this
court
that
such
legislation
probably
would
be
upheld.
but
as
i
say
i
have
not
made
a
--
such
a
study
of
it
that
i
seem
competent
--
mr.
israel
treiman
oh,
i
--
then
i'm
--
mr.
israel
treiman
oh,
i'm
sorry,
then
i've
been
misunderstood.
i
have
not
made
myself
plain,
your
honor.
that
is
not
what
i
--
mr.
israel
treiman
my
argument
as
to
that
had
to
do
with
a
piece
of
legislation
that
is
already
on
the
books.
and
what
i
am
saying
is
not
the
congress
didn't
have
power
at
that
time
to
have
such
legislation
so
worded
that
it
would
be
aimed
that
individual
action.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
when
it
did
exercise
its
power
in
1866,
it
did
not
aim
at
individual
(inaudible)
this
and
i
want
to
correct
any
impression
that
i
may
have
made
that
--
mr.
israel
treiman
if
marsh
versus
alabama?
mr.
israel
treiman
yes,
that
came
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
they
were
state
actions
--
mr.
israel
treiman
there
was
state
action
though.
mr.
israel
treiman
but
no
statute
there.
mr.
israel
treiman
correct.
mr.
israel
treiman
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
would
say
that
raises
the
question
as
to
whether
the
rights
under
the
first
amendment
are
any
greater
than
the
rights.
but
i
suppose
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
buy
a
property
or
something
like
that
or
due
process.
it's
a
question
of
balancing
values,
the
values
of
our
democratic
society.
and
i
say
that
that
question
should
be
resolved
by
congress,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
israel
treiman
the
right
of
free
speech
or
religion.
mr.
israel
treiman
no,
no.
mr.
israel
treiman
what
i'm
saying
--
what
i'm
--
mr.
israel
treiman
pardon?
i
didn't
get
what
--
mr.
israel
treiman
well,
i'm
balancing
--
i
really
was
not
balancing.
i
was
trying
to
--
in
this
case,
i
was
trying
to
say
in
reply
to
your
question
that
if
the
problem
is
one
determining
which
is
more
important,
the
right
to
distribute
literature
or
the
right
to
enjoy
property
properly
by
not
having
to
live
in
segregated
communities,
by
buying
the
house
whenever
the
house
is
on
the
market
without
--
being
prevented
doing
so
by
discriminatory
conduct.
if
that
is
the
problem,
i
say
then
you're
dealing
with
policy
making.
i
say
that
that
is
something
for
the
legislature
to
determine
rather
than
the
courts.
in
any
event
i
say
that
as
of
this
time,
the
legislature
has
not
yet
decided.
it
may
if
it
passes
a
fair
housing
bill
that
that
--
mr.
israel
treiman
it
decided
it
as
to
--
mr.
israel
treiman
pardon?
mr.
israel
treiman
in
marsh?
mr.
israel
treiman
i
don't
quite
understand
your
question
how
would
the
congress
--
mr.
israel
treiman
because
there
was
clearly
--
according
to
the
court,
state
action
involved
to
the
extent
of
the
property
that
had
been
opened
up
for
public
use.
this
was
the
theory
at
marsh.
and
that's
why
to
watchtower
case
distinguishes
it.
and
it
points
out
in
its
opinion
--
mr.
israel
treiman
pardon?
mr.
israel
treiman
right.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
points
that
out
immediately.
it
says
marsh's
activities
all
took
place
on
a
sidewalk
in
chickasaw
alabama,
a
company
town.
then
it
goes
on
a
point
out,
made
it
plain
that
a
municipal
corporation
cannot
ban
the
distribution
of
literature
on
its
streets,
sidewalks
and
public
places
so
as
public
areas.
and
that
is
why
i
thought
mr.
justice
black,
you
kept
saying
in
your
opinion.
i
don't
--
whether
you
repeated
it
but
i
know
your
famous
language
which
has
been
quoted
very
often,
that
private
property
does
become
circumscribed
by
constitutional
and
other
legal
rights
the
moment
it
has
been
opened
up
for
general
use.
mr.
israel
treiman
the
owner,
yes.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
what
that
town
did
--
resemble
a
regular
incorporated
town
just
as
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
israel
treiman
only
as
to
the
streets
and
sidewalks,
your
honors.
that
is
my
point.
and
let
me
--
it
seems
to
be
--was
it
held
that
a
state
--
mr.
israel
treiman
pardon?
mr.
israel
treiman
i
don't.
of
course
not.
mr.
israel
treiman
but
a
--
mr.
israel
treiman
yes.
mr.
israel
treiman
but
your
honor,
it
certainly
did
not
hold
that
the
constitutional
prohibition
would
apply
to
every
portion
of
the
town
of
chickasaw.
mr.
israel
treiman
even
the
private
owner
--
mr.
israel
treiman
when
used
or
intended
for
general
public
use,
that's
their
language.
and
that
we
agree
with
wholeheartedly.
and
that
is
the
reason
why
on
the
watchtower
case,
this
very
court
refused
to
grant
--
mr.
israel
treiman
on
section
1982?
mr.
israel
treiman
no,
no.
here,
we're
dealing
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
israel
treiman
as
to
that
claim,
there
are
two
claims
in
this
case.
one
claim
is
based
solely
on
1962
independently
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
other
is
based
solely
on
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
on
the
whole
cloth
of
that
section
without
any
kind
of
statutory
stitching
whatsoever.
in
its
bare
terms,
i
get
--
i
refer
to
the
language
of
mr.
justice
stewart
in
the
guest
case,
in
its
barest
terms.
and
it
is
our
position,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
until
and
unless
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
implemented
by
appropriate
legislation
no
right
of
action
exists
in
this
type
of
situation
as
against
the
(inaudible).
mr.
israel
treiman
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
israel
treiman
you
have
asked
another
--
mr.
israel
treiman
--
cutting
question
and
it's
a
question
that
i
have
posed
in
my
brief.
i
don't
know.
the
court
will
have
to
fashion
some
kind
of
a
remedy
for
the
plaintiff.
mr.
israel
treiman
even
the
government
admits
that
that
section
does
not
apply
because
it
clearly
says
under
color
of
law
and
it's
a
very
distinction
that
mr.
justice
fortas
made
in
the
price
case.
section
1943
is
like
section
242,
which
mr.
justice
fortas
so
enlighteningly
i
thought,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
israel
treiman
that
was
under
color
of
law.
mr.
israel
treiman
but
the
government
doesn't
--
mr.
israel
treiman
even
the
government
in
its
brief
says
that
it
admittedly
that
section
does
not
apply
for
purposes
--
mr.
israel
treiman
pardon.
no.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
don't
think
even
the
petitioners
claim
that,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
israel
treiman
it
comes
from
the
county
water
company
just
as
the
other
utilities
come
from
public
utilities.
mr.
israel
treiman
yes,
and
the
complaint
alleges
that.
mr.
israel
treiman
they
are
--
no,
i
don't
think
so.
they
are
privately
owned
but
they're
quasi
public
utilities
and
--
mr.
israel
treiman
--
regulated
by
the
state.
mr.
israel
treiman
that
also
is
--
i
think
this
particular
subdivision
is
beyond
the
limits
reached
by
the
saint
louis
metropolitan
sewer
agency.
and
so
it
is,
i
think,
handled
by
a
private
sewer
agency.
and
the
subdevelop
--
the
subdivision
developer
has
to
build
a
trunk
line
to
some
sort
of
a
treatment
plant
that
is
maintained
by
that
sewer
agency.
and
i
think
they
can
use
some
facilities
of
that
sewer
agency.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
would
say
that
is
done
by
--
what
is
the
name
of
that
--
there's
an
organization
of
communities
that
furnish
--
mr.
israel
treiman
yes.
i
don't
deny
that
at
all.
fire
police
protection,
surely.
mr.
israel
treiman
right,
just
as
any
other
citizen.
i,
as
a
private
homeowner,
i
don't
have
to
be
a
subdivision
developer
to
have
that,
those
facilities
available
to
me.
i'm
sorry.
i've
see
the
red
light.
thank
you
for
your
patience.
mr.
israel
treiman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
a
--
so
we've
got
seven
minutes
left.
i
don't
know
just
where
to
begin
with.
the
court
has
already
touched
through
its
questioning
on
what
i
believe
are
some
of
the
most
sensitive
areas
in
this
entire
case
especially
the
questions
directed
by
mr.
justice
white
at
the
very
end
which
i
think
clearly
indicate
the
profound
complications
and
the
very
troublesome
problems
and
difficulties
that
will
arise
inevitably
if
this
court
should
construe
section
1982
as
the
petitioners
and
the
government
and
the
amici
wanted
to.
i,
speaking
of
the
amici,
may
it
please
the
court
in
the
few
minutes
that
i
have
left,
i
should
like
to
make
few
general
observations
as
your
honors
have
probably
observed.
there
are
great
many
amici
briefs
that
have
been
filed
in
this
case
in
support
of
the
petitioners
and
i
must
confess
that
when
these
briefs
started
coming
to
my
office
i
was
not
a
little
shaken.
and
it
wasn't
--
it
wasn't
because
--
i
was
disturbed
over
the
fact
that
with
all
these
many
organizations
and
fine
lawyers
on
one
side,
i
was
being
left
in
a
somewhat
friendless
position
in
this
courtroom.
i've
become
sort
of
accustomed
to
that
back
home
where
even
some
of
my
good
friends
were
beginning
to
look
upon
me
as
if
i
had
suddenly
become
afflicted
with
leprosy.
what
disturbed
me,
may
it
please
the
court,
what
gave
me
real
concern
was
how
i
was
suppose
to
deal
with
all
of
these
good
briefs
and
they
are
excellent
briefs
especially
the
two
that
have
been
mentioned
here.
the
--
i'm
talking
now
but
the
amici
briefs,
one
by
the
government
and
the
other
by
group
of
national
organizations
headed
by
one
that
calls
itself
the
national
committee
against
discrimination
in
housing,
which
i
shall
refer
to
as
i
have
in
my
brief
as
the
ncadh
brief.
and
speaking
of
that
brief,
may
it
please
the
court,
with
reference
to
the
statements
made
by
the
honorable
attorney
general,
in
regard
to
the
effect
that
segregation,
racial
segregation
has
had
upon
the
life
of
our
country,
i
want
to
say
here
and
now,
personally
i
bow
to
nobody
when
it
comes
to
concern
over
the
plight
of
the
disadvantaged
negro
family.
and
may
i
have
this,
i
have
read
many
articles
and
books
on
this
subject,
but
as
i
told
the
person
who
i
believe
was
the
principal
writer
of
the
ncadh
brief,
i
have
now
seen
anywhere
a
more
powerful,
a
more
eloquent
description
of
the
terrible
--
the
terrible
condition
in
plight
in
which
not
only
the
children
but
the
adults
of
the
negro
families
find
themselves
by
reason
of
their
difficulty
in
obtaining
decent
housing.
so
that
as
to
that
part
of
the
attorney
general's
argument,
as
far
as
that
part
is
concern,
i
assure
the
court
that
i
do
not
quarrel
either
with
the
attorney
general
or
with
any
of
these
good
friends
of
the
court
who
come
into
this
case.
what
disturbs
me,
your
honors,
is
the
way
in
which
they
think
this
problem
should
be
solved.
and
i
must
say,
since
i
will
have
only
a
minute,
as
i
came
into
the
courtroom
this
morning
for
the
first
time,
i
saw
the
words
that
are
inscribed
over
the
portals
of
this
courthouse
“equal
justice
under
law.”
i
must
confess
my
ignorance,
i
did
not
know
those
words
were
there.
and
it
struck
me
that
this
perhaps
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
this
case
surely
nobody
would
deny
equal
justice
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
under
section
1982.
but
the
other
two
words
are
just
as
important,
it
seems
to
me.
it
must
be
under
law.
i
happen
to
be
a
practicing
lawyer
back
home
and
not
a
lawyer
who
assure
you,
your
honors,
professors
to
have
any
great
knowledge
about
constitutional
law.
i
happen
to
be
what
people
referred
to
as
the
bread
and
butter
type
of
practicing
lawyer.
and
while
i
have
that
deep
sympathy
for
the
conditions
that
have
been
described
caused
by
the
acute
problems
of
housing,
i
am
also
a
practicing
lawyer.
i
have
an
equal
reverence
for
the
orderliness
of
the
law.
and
i
believe
your
honors
that
if
we
are
to
meet
this
problem,
let
us
meet
it
in
a
way
that
it's
provided
for
under
our
constitution
and
under
our
philosophy
of
the
meaning
of
law.
it's
2:30
and
if
i
may
i
should
like
to
close
and
reserve
my
time
unless
the
court
wishes
to
ask
me
questions.
mr.
israel
treiman
thank
you.
mr.
israel
treiman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
pass
now
as
quickly
as
possible
to
what
i
regard
as
the
pivotal
points
of
this
case.
and
i
should
like
to
consider
those
points
in
two
categories
corresponding
to
the
two
grounds
on
which
the
petitioners
and
the
major
briefs,
that
is
the
government
brief
and
the
ncadh
brief,
and
i
must
say
two
or
three
others,
claimed
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
dismissing
the
claim.
and
that
the
petitioners
are
entitled
to
recover
on
the
basis
of
the
allegations
set
forth
in
their
complaint.
now,
taking
up
the
first
claim,
the
first
ground,
which
has
to
do
with
this
civil
rights
act
of
1866
or
rather
that
portion
of
it
which
appears
today
in
section
1982
of
title
42
of
united
states
code
which
incidentally
the
government
and
its
brief
refers
to
by
its
revised
statute
designation
of
section
1978.
here,
your
honors,
we
deal
with
a
question
of
pure
statutory
construction.
and
i
should
like
to
emphasize
that,
particularly
in
view
of
the
question
that
i
believe
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
of
counsel
for
the
petitioners
yesterday.
mr.
justice
fortas,
as
i
recall
asked
counsel
who
was
then
discussing,
i
believe
the
constitutionality
of
this
section
under
the
thirteenth
amendment
whether
one
could
not
presume
that
the
respondents
would
take
the
position
that
this
section
owe
its
constitution
of
validity
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
rather
than
the
thirteenth.
and
as
i
recall,
counsel
for
the
petitioners
and
i'm
sure
there
was
no
intention
or
whatsoever
on
his
part
to
put
the
respondent
in
an
incorrect
position
or
mislead
the
court.
counsel
for
the
petitioners
said,
yes,
he
would
presume
that
our
position
would
be,
that
this
section
owes
its
life,
owes
its
constitutional
life,
you
might
say
to
the
fourteenth
rather
than
the
thirteenth
amendment.
it
seems
therefore
that
the
repetition
on
the
emphasis
with
which
i
thought,
i
had
made
it
clear
in
my
brief
that
we
were
not
concerned
with
the
constitutionality
of
this
section.
that
therefore
it
mattered
not
to
us
whether
it
should
be
regarded
as
rooted
in
the
thirteenth
amendment
or
the
fourteenth
amendment,
escaped
the
attention
of
counsel
for
the
petitioners.
but,
as
your
honors
will
recall
in
connection
with
another
question
counsel
for
the
petitioners
did
say
that
we
had
conceded
the
constitutionality
of
this
civil
rights
act
which
is
true.
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
in
our
brief,
we
open
up
by
saying
that
one
of
the
three
questions
which
the
petitioners
present
as
questions
presented
in
this
case
maybe
eliminated.
and
that
question
in
the
petitioner's
brief
was
whether
the
--
whether
section
1982
is
constitutional.
we
are
not
questioning
the
constitutionality
of
that
section.
what
are
we
questioning
then?
we're
questioning
the
meaning
of
that
section.
it
is
no
matter
of
congressional
power.
but
at
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
or
the
fourteenth
or
any
other
provision
of
the
constitution,
it
isn't
a
question
of
whether
had
congress
in
1866
passed
an
act
which
was
directed
against
individual
conduct
whether
congress
thereby
was
exercising
a
valid
power
either
under
the
thirteenth
or
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
incidentally
maybe
a
question
that
will
be
raised
if
congress
should
pass
a
fair
housing
bill,
of
course,
because
under
your
customary
fair
housing
bill,
it's
the
individual
owner
or
seller
who
is
prohibited
from
discriminating
of
that
may
raise
a
question
as
to
whether
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
the
enabling
section
or
section
2
of
the
thirteenth
amendment.
congress
has
the
power
to
enact
legislation
of
this
kind.
that
is
not
the
question
here.
so,
i
come
to
what
i
think
is
the
crucial
question.
with
respect
to
this
statute
that
has
been
made
so
mush
of
that
the
honorable
attorney
general
relied
so
heavily
on
yesterday.
this
statute
has
some
very
simple
words,
i
think.
it's
a
question
what
those
words
mean.
and
if
you
kept
down
to
what
i
think
are
the
key
words,
what
are
they?
it
says,
“every
person
shall
have
the
same
right
to
buy
property
as
is
enjoyed
by
white
citizens”.
what
does
that
mean?
what
does
the
word
“right”
in
that
sentence
mean?
does
it
mean
right
in
the
sense
of
legal
ability,
legal
competence
to
buy,
own,
and
incidentally
inherit?
that
word
is
also
used
in
the
statute;
property
and
self
property.
or
does
it
mean
something
more
than
that?
doesn't
mean
something
that
is
not
so
much
related
to
the
status
of
the
--
or
the
position
of
the
buyer
as
it
is
to
the
seller,
to
the
conduct
of
a
seller,
something
that
is
not
just
a
matter
of
right
but
of
matter
of
duty,
a
duty
imposed
upon
the
seller.
mr.
israel
treiman
1982
your
honor.
mr.
israel
treiman
1982
which
is
the
section
involved
here
or
1978
of
the
revised
statutes.
that
is
a
portion
by
the
way,
a
portion
of
the
original
civil
rights
act.
you'll
find
that
portion
in
the
first
section
of
the
original
act
which
had
a
number
of
sections
in
it.
well
now
the
petitioners
in
this
case
claimed
that
this
section
is
directed
and
was
intended
to
be
directed
against
the
seller.
that
it
didn't
simply
mean
right
in
the
sense
of
right
by
law
legal
competence.
and
in
order
to
prove
--
we
of
course
take
the
position
that
this
section
should
be
construed
as
being
in
confined
to
laws
or
official
action
of
some
kind
which
say
that
a
negro
shall
not
have
the
same
right
as
a
white
citizen.
and
it
was
--
it
cannot
be
and
should
not
be
construed
as
being
aimed,
that
individual,
the
individual
behavior
of
a
seller.
now
in
order
to
prove
that
its
construction
is
correct,
the
petitioners
and
the
writers
of
the
ncadh
brief,
ncadh
brief
and
that
particularly
the
government,
i
say
particularly
the
government
for
a
reason
which
i'll
mention
shortly,
insist
on
taking
us
back
to
the
year
1866,
to
the
early
part
of
the
year
1866,
on
the
39th
congress
enacted
this
section.
and
i
must
say,
your
honors,
that
when
i
saw
in
the
government's
brief,
the
historical
materials,
the
--
not
secondary
but
primary
source
materials
on
which
apparently
the
government
claimed
its
construction
would
be
justified.
i
shuddered
a
little
bit
because
it
meant
that
i
would
have
to
indulge
in
some
historical
research.
and
i
do
not
profess
to
be
expert
in
delving
into
historical
materials
but
i
felt
that
as
a
lawyer,
and
especially
since
the
government
gave
me
the
specific
leads,
it
blueprinted
these
sources
specifically
the
materials
which
it
said
would
prove
that
that
was
the
intention
of
congress
in
1866,
and
so
i
went
to
these
sources.
now,
what
were
they?
now,
i'll
make
this
as
brief
as
possible.
the
government
claims
that
if
you
consult
the
statements,
the
speeches
made
in
congress,
the
39th
congress,
the
speeches
of
the
sponsors
of
this
section
--
of
this
act
of
1866,
the
speeches
of
the
opponents
of
the
act,
and
one
other
statement,
the
statement
of
president
andrew
johnson,
when
he
vetoed
this
bill,
the
reasons
that
he
gave
for
vetoing
the
bill.
you
will
find
says
the
government
that
the
bill
must
have
been
intended
to
be
directed
against
individual
action.
i
must
say
since
i
mentioned
president
johnson's
veto
message
in
order
that
the
court
may
follow
me
in
connection
with
another
matter
which
i
shall
presently
mention,
a
very
important
matter
which
does
involved
a
matter
of
comparing
dates.
this
act
of
1866
was
first
enacted
on
march
13,
1866.
president
johnson
vetoed.
it
was
then
reenacted
over
the
president's
veto
on
april
9,
which
is
a
date
usually
given
as
a
date
of
enactment
of
this
act
of
1866.
now,
i
went
into
the
statements,
the
speeches
made
in
the
congressional
record.
the
references
are
all
given
in
the
government's
brief.
it
was
not
known
by
the
way
as
a
congressional
record
that
--
yes,
they
seemed
congressional
globe.
and
i
took
the
statements
of
the
chairman
of
the
judiciary
committee
of
the
house
of
the
senate.
and
i
took
the
statements,
the
speeches;
i
read
them
all,
of
the
sponsors
of
the
bill,
the
people
who
supported
the
bills
in
both
bodies
of
congress.
i
then
went
to
the
opponents
of
the
bill
and
i
got
their
statements.
and
i
have
set
forth
in
my
brief,
department
passages
from
the
statements
of
all
of
those
congressmen.
and
then
i
went
to
president
johnson's
veto
message.
and
i
have
set
forth
in
my
brief
the
pertinent
passage
from
his
message.
all
of
which
i
submit
your
honors
overwhelmingly,
convincingly,
proved
that
the
bill
was
never
intended.
this
civil
rights
act
of
1866
was
never
intended
to
be
directed
at
anything
but
laws,
legislation.
and
then
i
went
to
the
other
sources,
the
second
source
that
the
government
set,
the
second
document
on
which
it
said
it
would
be
--
could
be
shown
that
this
bill
was
intended
not
to
be
directed
against
discriminatory
laws
but
individual
conduct
and
what
was
that?
now,
this
is
quite
interesting.
the
government
says
that
there
are
two
documents,
a
senate
executive
document
and
a
house
executive
document,
which
will
prove
that
in
all
of
the
black
codes
that
were
enacted
after
the
civil
war,
some
of
them
maybe
before.
by
the
time
congress
got
to
deliberating
on
this
act,
all
disqualification
of
negroes
to
own
property
had
been
removed.
now,
this
is
quite
a
statement.
it's
in
the
government's
brief.
i
think
it
reads
--
it
appears
that
in
none
of
the
black
codes
in
the
early
part
of
1966
was
there
any
disqualification
left
to
the
negro
from
owning
property?
i
then
went
to
these
two
documents
and
what
were
they?
both
of
these
documents
contained,
each
contains
a
report.
a
report
prepared
by
the
then
secretary
of
state
mr.
stewart
under
the
direction
of
president
johnson
for
submission
to
congress.
so
that
congress
would
know
what
was
going
on
so
far
as
discriminatory
legislation
was
concerned,
discriminatory
as
against
the
negro
of
course.
and
what
does
the
report
say?
i
must
say
i
was
dismayed
of
what
i
found
in
the
light
of
what
the
government
asserts.
i
found
that
according
to
that
report
which
incidentally
your
honors
adheres
where
that
date
becomes
important
in
connection
with
the
date
of
the
passage
of
this
bill.
this
report
is
dated
may
22,
1966,
which
was
after
the
originally
enactment
of
the
bill
as
well
as
its
reenactment
following
president
johnson's
veto.
it
says
that
in
all
--
it
let
--
it
reviews
a
number
of
the
southern
states.
and
it
says
that
in
all
of
those
states
with
two
exceptions,
the
disqualifications
of
the
negroes
still
remain.
it
points
it
out
very
clearly
and
i
will
presently
show
how.
apparently,
what
happened
was
and
in
each
of
these
states,
a
state
convention
was
called,
as
this
is
of
course
familiar
post
civil
war
history.
a
state
convention
was
called
by
the
provincial
governor
of
the
state
appointed
by
president
johnson,
andrew
johnson.
the
convention
was
called
and
of
course
it
was
completely
dominated
by
the
northerners
and
their
southern
sympathizers.
and
so,
there
was
no
difficulty
whatsoever
in
getting
resolutions
adopted
that
would
be
in
line
with
northern
feelings.
in
each
of
these
states
says
this
report,
in
each
of
these
states,
first,
there
was
a
resolution
adopted,
proclaiming
that
there
would
be
no
more
slavery
in
that
state.
then
it
was
followed
in
--
i
think
every
case
by
another
resolution.
and
that
second
resolution
called
upon
the
chairman
of
the
convention
to
appoint
a
committee
or
a
commission
that
would
come
in
with
a
set
of
recommended
laws,
revisions
of
the
then
existing
state
laws
in
order
to
bring
the
state
laws
into
conformity
with
the
thirteenth
amendment,
with
the
emancipation
situation.
and
what
happened?
according
to
this
report,
most
of
these
cases
such
a
committee
was
appointed.
in
several
of
the
cases,
several
of
the
states,
the
committee
actually
went
to
work.
and
there
is
set
forth
in
the
report
a
set
of
statutes
in
which,
of
course,
all
disqualification
of
the
negro
was
eliminated.
but
this
was
a
set
of
statutes
which
the
committee,
the
commission,
and
the
convention
resolved,
should
be
recommended
for
enactment
by
the
local
legislature.
except
in
two
cases,
texas
and
georgia
as
of
the
date
of
this
report,
no
such
legislation
has
yet
been
enacted.
and
interestingly
enough,
even
in
texas
and
georgia
which
had
changed
their
laws
and
had
removed
disqualification.
when
did
that
take
place?
not
before
this
bill
was
passed.
in
one
case
it
took
place
several
weeks
but
in
both
cases,
it
took
place
after
the
first
enactment
of
the
bill.
and
in
one
case,
it
took
place
before
its
reenactment
but
certainly
after
the
originally
enactment
of
this
bill.
for
the
government
therefore
to
say
that
when
congress
was
debating,
considering
this
bill,
there
was
no
need
to
do
anything
about
discriminatory
laws
from
these
black
codes
to
me
is
astonishing.
it's
contradicted
by
the
evidence
i
submit.
and
furthermore,
your
honors,
if
you
want
what
i
say
in
my
brief,
it's
probably
the
best
succinct
piece
of
evidence
on
that
point
that
you
would
want.
it's
that
of
justice
wayne
who
in
that
very
year
was
deciding
the
case
sitting
as
a
circuit
justice.
he
was
deciding
the
case
of
u.s.
versus
rhodes.
and
in
the
course
of
his
opinion,
he
makes
the
statement,
i
quote
it
in
my
brief,
that
as
soon
as
the
thirteenth
amendment
was
passed,
there
begun
a
course
of
legislative
oppression,
legislative
oppression
through
this
black
codes
of
course.
and
that
this
statute
obviously,
i
don't
know
whether
to
use
the
word
“obviously
or
undoubtedly”,
was
enacted
to
curve
that
course
of
legislative
oppression.
there
you
have
the
real
purpose
of
the
statute.
law,
discriminatory
law
is
not
an
individual
conduct.
now,
passing
from
the
context,
the
setting
in
which
the
act
was
enacted,
i'm
looking
at
what's
happened
to
this
act.
after
all
it's
over
a
hundred
years,
this
act
has
been
existence.
the
natural
question
is,
why
hasn't
it
been
used
before
in
a
situation
of
this
kind?
why
hasn't
it
used
before
in
a
situation
where
a
discriminatory
law
was
not
involved
but
discriminatory
conduct?
mr.
israel
treiman
set
forth
in
my
brief,
your
honor
the
--
mr.
israel
treiman
would
you
like
for
me
to
read
it?
mr.
israel
treiman
they
--
mr.
israel
treiman
specifically
--
mr.
israel
treiman
specifically,
in
fact
--
mr.
israel
treiman
--
the
times
they
were
asked.
are
you
intending
to
go
into
our
states
and
make
a
criminal
code
directed
against
individuals
and
the
answer
was
no,
not
at
all.
in
those
states
where
your
laws
do
not
disqualify
this
statute
will
have
no
effect.
specifically,
they
say
that.
and
i
have
the
quotations
in
my
brief.
and
i
have
those
particular
passages
in
bold
type
about
eight
-10
pages
of
it.
mr.
israel
treiman
yes,
yes.
the
government
says
that
--
mr.
israel
treiman
well,
but
the
point
is
that
--
mr.
israel
treiman
to
have
what?
mr.
israel
treiman
that's
right.
and
as
i
see
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
government
says,
well,
that
word
“right”
means
--
i
think
that
is
mr.
liberman
said
yesterday
has
to
do
with
the
extension
which
you
can
enjoy
the
right.
it
isn't
only
a
matter
of
legal
right
of
right
by
law.
it's
a
matter
of
whether
you
can
get
somebody
else,
an
unwilling
seller
whether
you
can
compel
him
to
sell
to
you
because
he
is
willing
to
sell
it
to
somebody
else
who
is
not
a
negro.
so
it's
a
question
of
whether
this
statute
is
directed
against
laws
only
--
mr.
israel
treiman
i
think
so
your
honor,
and
i
have
this
passages
--
mr.
israel
treiman
yes,
yes.
mr.
israel
treiman
i'll
see
if
i
can
get
it
immediately.
mr.
israel
treiman
pardon?
mr.
israel
treiman
yes.
mr.
israel
treiman
yes,
the
part
in
bold
type.
in
an
--
if
an
offense
is
committed
against
a
colored
person
simply
because
he
is
colored
in
a
state
where
the
law
affords
him
the
same
protection
as
if
he
were
white,
this
act
neither
has
no
--
or
was
intended
to
have
anything
to
do
with
this
case.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
didn't
get
your
question
mr.
justice.
mr.
israel
treiman
it
wasn't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
israel
treiman
yes.
mr.
israel
treiman
that
question
is
not
easy
to
answer,
mr.
justice
fortas
because
--
mr.
israel
treiman
i
agree.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
agree,
i
cannot
say
confidently
that
the
congressman
who
made
that
statement
had
in
mind
only
that
portion
of
it
which
is
today
1982
or
other
portions.
and
i'm
well
aware
mr.
justice
fortas
that
the
phrase
under
color
of
law
appears
in
another
part
of
the
act,
yes.
mr.
israel
treiman
on
page
15.
in
the
statement
of
representative
wilson,
if
the
states
would
all
observe
the
rights
of
our
citizens,
there
would
be
no
need
of
this
bill.
and
then
later
on
he
speaks
of
laws
barbaric,
nothing
said
about
individual
conduct.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
believe
he
was
but
after
all,
that
bill
included
this
section.
mr.
israel
treiman
in
effect
i
suppose
it
would
be
so
far
as
this
section
is
concerned.
now
that
--
not
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
mr.
israel
treiman
yes.
mr.
israel
treiman
laws,
ordinances,
official
regulations,
official
conduct,
yes.
mr.
israel
treiman
black
codes
--
mr.
israel
treiman
black
codes
that
had
disqualifications
and
some
of
the
black
codes
did
not,
yes,
yes.
in
fact
i
think
that's
--
mr.
israel
treiman
well,
i
would
say
that
an
action
under
that
law
would
not
be
possible
in
a
state
that
has
no
discriminatory
laws,
yes.
that's
it
precisely.
mr.
israel
treiman
yes?
mr.
israel
treiman
in
the
sense
of
a
law.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
would
think
if
there
are
no
laws,
no
regulations,
there
would
be
no
action
under
this,
under
this
particular
--
mr.
israel
treiman
(inaudible)
mr.
israel
treiman
well,
there
are
--
mr.
israel
treiman
does
it
change
the
language?
mr.
israel
treiman
but
where
the
protection
is
not
actually
enforced
because
some
individuals
choose
to
be
discriminatory.
mr.
israel
treiman
is
that
what
you
mean?
mr.
israel
treiman
yes.
well,
i
would
say
that's
right.
i
would
say
he'd
have
to
go
elsewhere
for
his
remedy
but
not
under
this
section.
mr.
israel
treiman
it's
a
proclamation
of
rights,
your
honor,
as
many
scholars
have
pointed
out
--
mr.
israel
treiman
yes,
yes.
like
some
--
like
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
mr.
israel
treiman
well,
i
believe
that
the
answer
to
that
is
the
same
that
should
be
given
and
i'd
intend
to
give
when
i
discussed
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
its
bare
terms.
mr.
israel
treiman
it
merely
says
--
mr.
israel
treiman
it
merely
says
that
there
is
a
right
not
to
have
a
law.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
would
say
that
the
right
there
and
i
don't
deny,
mr.
justice
black.
we
do
get
into
a
realm
here
that
to
some
extent
may
depend
upon
semantics
upon
the
objective
one
has
in
mind
in
trying
to
interpret
this
section.
i
can
only
go
by
what
the
congressman
said
back
on
those
days
by
what
president
johnson
said
in
his
veto
message
when
he
said
that
in
his
opinion
this
would
change
the
laws
of
the
states.
and
he
didn't
want
congress
to
meddle
with
local
laws.
and
i
would
say
the
same
thing
same
conclusion
must
be
reached
in
reading
justice
wayne's
opinion.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
agree,
of
course
in
those
states
where
they
have
discriminatory
laws.
mr.
israel
treiman
i'm
not
so
sure
i
would
say
it
would
be
automatically
rid
--
gone,
it's
there
hovering
all
the
time
in
the
moment
the
state
does
pass
a
law.
this
is
discriminatory.
that
section
could
be
invoked.
mr.
israel
treiman
only
if
the
state
passes
a
law
in
violation
of
that
section
and
i
might
at
this
point,
your
honor,
perhaps
call
your
attention
to
this
statement
in
--
mr.
israel
treiman
that
would
depend
on
who
the
group
is
--
mr.
israel
treiman
if
the
group
is
in
any
way
financed
by
any
kind
of
state
agency
--
mr.
israel
treiman
if
they
go
to
the
commission,
the
plan
commission
to
get
approval
of
their
subdivision
plan?
mr.
israel
treiman
you
mean
in
the
corporate
purposes,
it
would
be
set
forth
that
they
were
going
to
have
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
israel
treiman
this
would
depend
on
the
attitude
of
the
secretary
of
state
when
he
reads
the
proposed
articles
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
israel
treiman
i
would
say
i
think
you're
getting
pretty
close
to
shelly
versus
kraemer.
you're
getting
pretty
close
to
action
by
an
official.
if
he
approves
articles
within
the
corporation
that
explicitly
state
that
this
will
be
segregated,
yes.
i
would
say
this
is
official
conduct.
it's
giving
the
sanction
of
the
state
to
something
that's
clearly
unconstitutional,
yes
i
would.
mr.
israel
treiman
on
the
basis
of
population,
i
suppose
it
would.
any
group
of
individuals
in
a
certain
area
under
our
state
statutes,
now
i
presume
this
is
true
all
over.
if
they
have
a
certain
number
of
people
can
qualify
for
a
certain
type
of
incorporate
--
mr.
israel
treiman
they
incorporated
--
mr.
israel
treiman
and
it
was
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
israel
treiman
i
would
say
--
mr.
israel
treiman
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
to
me
would
be
as
violative
as
anything
could
possibly
be
because
there
you're
getting
with
a
political
subdivision.
mr.
israel
treiman
would
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
can
answer
that
--
mr.
israel
treiman
the
city
of
the
fourth
class
would
be
a
political
subdivision
of
the
state.
mr.
israel
treiman
it's
a
very
important
difference
i
think,
mr.
justice
marshall,
for
this
reason.
the
city
of
saint
louis
for
example,
could
not
in
selling
any
part
of
its
property
discriminate
--
mr.
israel
treiman
but
a
private
owner
--
mr.
israel
treiman
right,
but
a
private
owner
and
you
yesterday
mentioned
--
mr.
israel
treiman
mr.
justice
marshall,
you
are
now
reaching
the
point
which
i
think
some
of
your
question
yesterday
was
directed
to
and
that
involves
the
case
marsh
versus
alabama.
and
i
am
most
anxious
to
discuss
that
case.
i
had
deferred
it
because
as
i've
said
earlier,
i
want
to
deal
with
these
questions
under
two
categories
and
your
question,
i
--
mr.
israel
treiman
no,
i'll
--
no,
i
--
i
think
i
would
just
assume
mr.
justice
marshall
since
you
are
interested
in
that
point
and
it's
a
tremendously
important
point
and
i
must
say
when
i
read
marsh
versus
alabama
for
the
first
time
in
connection
with
this
case,
i
said
well,
this
is
on
all
fours,
how
can
we
get
around
that
case?
here
is
a
big
community,
not
in
--
not
a
city,
a
company
owned
town.
and
here
was
the
united
states
supreme
court
holding
that
the
fact
that
it
was
all
privately
owned
didn't
settle
the
question.
i
think
that
was
the
expression
used
by
mr.
justice
black
in
his
opinion
in
that
case.
property
rights
do
not
settle
the
question.
now
what
happened
in
that
case?
it
was
a
jehovah's
witness
by
a
name
of
marsh
who
came
under
this
company
owned
town,
i
think
it
was
suburb
of
mobile,
alabama
and
the
--
want
to
distribute
some
religious
literature.
and
the
company
representatives
told
her,
there
was
a
regulation
against
it,
warned
her
to
--
not
to
do
so.
despite
the
warning,
she
continued
to
sell
the
literature.
she
was
arrested
on
a
charged
of
violating
the
local
in
effect
trespass
statute.
she
was
convicted.
she
took
an
appeal
to
this
court.
this
court
held
that
she
was
protected
by
the
constitutional
provision.
this
happened
to
be
the
first
amendment,
but
the
same
point
of
course
would
apply
that
was
within
constitutional
prohibition.
and
you
might
say
therefore,
“well,
doesn't
this
control
this
case?”
not
one
bit
for
this
reason.
and
i
think
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
the
best
way
to
meet
that
case
is
to
consider
a
similar
case
that
arose
two
years
later,
the
watchtower
case
also
involving
jehovah's
witnesses.
now
what
was
the
watchtower?
it
rose
in
new
york.
it
came
however
as
i
should
presently
point
out
to
the
supreme
court
on
request
for
certiorari.
mr.
justice
marshall
since
you
are
interested
in
size,
i
should
like
to
describe
this
residential
community.
it
was
involved
in
a
watchtower
case.
it
was
called
parkchester.
and
it
is
described
this
way.
parkchester
is
a
residential
community
which
is
said
to
be
the
largest
of
its
kind
in
the
world
covering
129
acres
and
housing
12,000
family
units
made
up
of
some
35,000
people
in
171
adjoining
in
interrelated
apartment
building.
and
then
he
was
on
to
say
that
it
has
streets,
and
shops,
and
it's
a
regular
community,
but
all
privately
owned.
and
the
jehovah's
witnesses
came
there,
entered
one
of
these
apartment
buildings
and
then
in
the
hallways
tried
to
distribute
that
literature.
their
attention
was
called
to
the
fact
that
there
was
a
regulation
there
by
the
landlord,
the
owner
of
this
community.
no
distribution
of
literature
in
the
hallways
of
any
department.
where
they're
apparently
relying
on
marsh
versus
alabama
refused
to
abide
instead
of
getting
themselves
arrested
as
i
recall
they
challenged
the
validity
of
that
regulation
in
the
new
york
courts,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
israel
treiman
between
the
hallway?
mr.
israel
treiman
well,
not
inside
the
apartments,
i'm
talking
about
the
hallways.
mr.
israel
treiman
well,
your
honor,
may
i
then
read
to
you
--
mr.
israel
treiman
but
--
mr.
israel
treiman
the
difference
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall
is
this.
what
part
of
this
subdivision
that
we're
talking
about?
if
you're
talking
about
the
lot
in
the
home
that
the
jones'
here
wanted
to
buy
that
in
a
language
of
mr.
justice
black
in
marsh
versus
alabama
was
never
intended
to
be
open
for
general
public
used.
mr.
israel
treiman
this
is
--
mr.
israel
treiman
not
all
responsibility.
not
its
public,
not
those
areas,
the
sidewalks,
the
streets,
the
parks
that
are
opened
up
for
public
use.
and
again
using
the
words
--
mr.
israel
treiman
pardon?
mr.
israel
treiman
not
the
streets,
not
--
yes,
they
could
be
closed
completely
for
certain
purposes
but
not
under
a
discriminatory
basis.
mr.
israel
treiman
to
ne
--
to
white
people
as
well
as
negroes
if
they're
private
streets,
certainly.
mr.
israel
treiman
some
are
private,
yes
and
i'm
glad
you
asked
that
question.
mr.
israel
treiman
oh,
yes,
some
are
private
and
some
are
public.
mr.
israel
treiman
sometimes
you
don't.
into
my
own
subdivision
for
example
--
mr.
israel
treiman
no,
not
necessarily,
they
have
this
wooden
horse
that
at
one
end
they
close
him
up
at
one
end,
i'm
sure
the
same
is
true,
all
of
the
county
in
order
to
keep
him
from
becoming
appropriated
by
the
public
and
keep
it
private.
all
that
privacy
means
really
in
those
cases
is
--
a
subdivision
has
to
maintain
them.
they
would
love
to
dedicate
some
of
these
private
streets
and
get
the
county
or
the
state
to
take
over
the
maintenance.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
concede
the
difference
is
as
to
what
is
involved
here,
i
mean
what
the
discrimination
is
supposed
to
affect.
in
this
case,
it's
supposed
to
affect
a
private
lot,
walks,
an
area
that
was
not
intended
for
public
use,
i
must
come
back
to
mr.
justice
black's
language
in
the
unanimous
opinion
of
the
court
in
the
marsh
case
--
mr.
israel
treiman
not
for
public
use.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
--
was
offered
for
sale
--
mr.
israel
treiman
just
as
any
private
property
might
be
offered
for
sale.
mr.
israel
treiman
yes.
mr.
justice
marshall,
if
i
were
the
owner
--
mr.
israel
treiman
i
most
certainly
do.
i
think
that
the
right
to
buy
and
sell
property,
property
and
as
distinguished
from
its
use.
mr.
israel
treiman
the
right
to
buy
a
property?
mr.
israel
treiman
i
think
under
the
existing
state
of
the
law,
in
the
absence
of
legislation
pursuant
to
either
as
i
say
to
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
section
2
of
the
thirteenth,
i
don't
know
of
any
law
at
the
present
time
that
gives
to
the
buyer
the
right
to
buy
something
from
somebody
who
is
unwilling
to
sell
it
to
him
under
our
existing
law.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
would
say
that
under
the
existing
law
and
i
would
add
unfortunately
i'm
afraid
that
is
so,
mr.
justice
marshall,
until
congress
passes
a
fair
housing
law.
and
this
is
what
disturbs
me.
mr.
justice
fortas
yesterday
--
mr.
israel
treiman
pardon?
mr.
israel
treiman
pardon?
mr.
israel
treiman
your
honor,
it
could
of
course.
and
this
is
what
shocked
me
a
little
bit
yesterday
when
a
question
was
asked
to
the
honorable
attorney
general
about
mr.
justice
white
i
think.
i
think
mr.
justice
white
asked
the
attorney
general,
“well,
wouldn't
our
decision
then
make
unnecessary
a
fair
housing
law?”
and
the
honorable
attorney
general
said,
“no”,
he
didn't
think
so
because
this
decision
would
be
broader
than
a
fair
housing
law
order.
to
me,
the
whole
is
greater
than
of
--
any
of
its
parts.
if
you
go
(inaudible)
as
you
might
say
why
would
you
need?
why
would
you
need
a
narrower
type
of
legislation?
it
would
--
would
it
not
then
--
and
this
--
since
i
started
to
say
is
what
disturbs
me
a
great
deal.
and
i
hope
this
court
will
also
bear
this
in
mind.
i
was
very
much
impressed
yesterday
by
a
reference
of
mr.
justice
fortas
made
to
align
from
oscar
wilde.
we
kill
that
which
we
--
the
thing
we
love.
isn't
--
not
possible
that
trying
to
get
this
court,
the
federal
courts
to
do
something
which
so
many
people
are
asking
congress
to
do
might
in
some
way
--
mr.
israel
treiman
pardon?
mr.
israel
treiman
i
would
rather
not
ask
--
answer
that
question,
your
honor.
it's
not
involved
in
this
case.
and
i
have
not
made
a
sufficient
study.
i
--
mr.
israel
treiman
i
would
say
if
congress
does
pass
such
a
law
to
this,
then
would
be
the
question,
has
congress
--
mr.
israel
treiman
i
--
then
i've
been
misunderstood.
mr.
israel
treiman
well,
it
maybe,
it
maybe
but
i
don't
--
in
this
case
involves
that
question
because
we
have
no
legislation.
we're
dealing
here
with
the
bare
terms
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
used
--
mr.
justice
stewart's
language
in
the
guest
case.
now
if
congress
does
implement
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
passing
some
appropriate
legislation
such
as
the
housing
law,
then
perhaps,
we
have
a
serious
constitutional
question.
i
don't
know.
i
would
think
in
view
of
some
of
the
recent
opinions
of
this
court
that
such
legislation
probably
would
be
upheld.
but
as
i
say
i
have
not
made
a
--
such
a
study
of
it
that
i
seem
competent
--
mr.
israel
treiman
oh,
i
--
then
i'm
--
mr.
israel
treiman
oh,
i'm
sorry,
then
i've
been
misunderstood.
i
have
not
made
myself
plain,
your
honor.
that
is
not
what
i
--
mr.
israel
treiman
my
argument
as
to
that
had
to
do
with
a
piece
of
legislation
that
is
already
on
the
books.
and
what
i
am
saying
is
not
the
congress
didn't
have
power
at
that
time
to
have
such
legislation
so
worded
that
it
would
be
aimed
that
individual
action.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
when
it
did
exercise
its
power
in
1866,
it
did
not
aim
at
individual
(inaudible)
this
and
i
want
to
correct
any
impression
that
i
may
have
made
that
--
mr.
israel
treiman
if
marsh
versus
alabama?
mr.
israel
treiman
yes,
that
came
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
they
were
state
actions
--
mr.
israel
treiman
there
was
state
action
though.
mr.
israel
treiman
but
no
statute
there.
mr.
israel
treiman
correct.
mr.
israel
treiman
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
would
say
that
raises
the
question
as
to
whether
the
rights
under
the
first
amendment
are
any
greater
than
the
rights.
but
i
suppose
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
buy
a
property
or
something
like
that
or
due
process.
it's
a
question
of
balancing
values,
the
values
of
our
democratic
society.
and
i
say
that
that
question
should
be
resolved
by
congress,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
israel
treiman
the
right
of
free
speech
or
religion.
mr.
israel
treiman
no,
no.
mr.
israel
treiman
what
i'm
saying
--
what
i'm
--
mr.
israel
treiman
pardon?
i
didn't
get
what
--
mr.
israel
treiman
well,
i'm
balancing
--
i
really
was
not
balancing.
i
was
trying
to
--
in
this
case,
i
was
trying
to
say
in
reply
to
your
question
that
if
the
problem
is
one
determining
which
is
more
important,
the
right
to
distribute
literature
or
the
right
to
enjoy
property
properly
by
not
having
to
live
in
segregated
communities,
by
buying
the
house
whenever
the
house
is
on
the
market
without
--
being
prevented
doing
so
by
discriminatory
conduct.
if
that
is
the
problem,
i
say
then
you're
dealing
with
policy
making.
i
say
that
that
is
something
for
the
legislature
to
determine
rather
than
the
courts.
in
any
event
i
say
that
as
of
this
time,
the
legislature
has
not
yet
decided.
it
may
if
it
passes
a
fair
housing
bill
that
that
--
mr.
israel
treiman
it
decided
it
as
to
--
mr.
israel
treiman
pardon?
mr.
israel
treiman
in
marsh?
mr.
israel
treiman
i
don't
quite
understand
your
question
how
would
the
congress
--
mr.
israel
treiman
because
there
was
clearly
--
according
to
the
court,
state
action
involved
to
the
extent
of
the
property
that
had
been
opened
up
for
public
use.
this
was
the
theory
at
marsh.
and
that's
why
to
watchtower
case
distinguishes
it.
and
it
points
out
in
its
opinion
--
mr.
israel
treiman
pardon?
mr.
israel
treiman
right.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
points
that
out
immediately.
it
says
marsh's
activities
all
took
place
on
a
sidewalk
in
chickasaw
alabama,
a
company
town.
then
it
goes
on
a
point
out,
made
it
plain
that
a
municipal
corporation
cannot
ban
the
distribution
of
literature
on
its
streets,
sidewalks
and
public
places
so
as
public
areas.
and
that
is
why
i
thought
mr.
justice
black,
you
kept
saying
in
your
opinion.
i
don't
--
whether
you
repeated
it
but
i
know
your
famous
language
which
has
been
quoted
very
often,
that
private
property
does
become
circumscribed
by
constitutional
and
other
legal
rights
the
moment
it
has
been
opened
up
for
general
use.
mr.
israel
treiman
the
owner,
yes.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
what
that
town
did
--
resemble
a
regular
incorporated
town
just
as
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
israel
treiman
only
as
to
the
streets
and
sidewalks,
your
honors.
that
is
my
point.
and
let
me
--
it
seems
to
be
--was
it
held
that
a
state
--
mr.
israel
treiman
pardon?
mr.
israel
treiman
i
don't.
of
course
not.
mr.
israel
treiman
but
a
--
mr.
israel
treiman
yes.
mr.
israel
treiman
but
your
honor,
it
certainly
did
not
hold
that
the
constitutional
prohibition
would
apply
to
every
portion
of
the
town
of
chickasaw.
mr.
israel
treiman
even
the
private
owner
--
mr.
israel
treiman
when
used
or
intended
for
general
public
use,
that's
their
language.
and
that
we
agree
with
wholeheartedly.
and
that
is
the
reason
why
on
the
watchtower
case,
this
very
court
refused
to
grant
--
mr.
israel
treiman
on
section
1982?
mr.
israel
treiman
no,
no.
here,
we're
dealing
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
israel
treiman
as
to
that
claim,
there
are
two
claims
in
this
case.
one
claim
is
based
solely
on
1962
independently
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
other
is
based
solely
on
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
on
the
whole
cloth
of
that
section
without
any
kind
of
statutory
stitching
whatsoever.
in
its
bare
terms,
i
get
--
i
refer
to
the
language
of
mr.
justice
stewart
in
the
guest
case,
in
its
barest
terms.
and
it
is
our
position,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
until
and
unless
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
implemented
by
appropriate
legislation
no
right
of
action
exists
in
this
type
of
situation
as
against
the
(inaudible).
mr.
israel
treiman
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
israel
treiman
you
have
asked
another
--
mr.
israel
treiman
--
cutting
question
and
it's
a
question
that
i
have
posed
in
my
brief.
i
don't
know.
the
court
will
have
to
fashion
some
kind
of
a
remedy
for
the
plaintiff.
mr.
israel
treiman
even
the
government
admits
that
that
section
does
not
apply
because
it
clearly
says
under
color
of
law
and
it's
a
very
distinction
that
mr.
justice
fortas
made
in
the
price
case.
section
1943
is
like
section
242,
which
mr.
justice
fortas
so
enlighteningly
i
thought,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
israel
treiman
that
was
under
color
of
law.
mr.
israel
treiman
but
the
government
doesn't
--
mr.
israel
treiman
even
the
government
in
its
brief
says
that
it
admittedly
that
section
does
not
apply
for
purposes
--
mr.
israel
treiman
pardon.
no.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
don't
think
even
the
petitioners
claim
that,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
israel
treiman
it
comes
from
the
county
water
company
just
as
the
other
utilities
come
from
public
utilities.
mr.
israel
treiman
yes,
and
the
complaint
alleges
that.
mr.
israel
treiman
they
are
--
no,
i
don't
think
so.
they
are
privately
owned
but
they're
quasi
public
utilities
and
--
mr.
israel
treiman
--
regulated
by
the
state.
mr.
israel
treiman
that
also
is
--
i
think
this
particular
subdivision
is
beyond
the
limits
reached
by
the
saint
louis
metropolitan
sewer
agency.
and
so
it
is,
i
think,
handled
by
a
private
sewer
agency.
and
the
subdevelop
--
the
subdivision
developer
has
to
build
a
trunk
line
to
some
sort
of
a
treatment
plant
that
is
maintained
by
that
sewer
agency.
and
i
think
they
can
use
some
facilities
of
that
sewer
agency.
mr.
israel
treiman
i
would
say
that
is
done
by
--
what
is
the
name
of
that
--
there's
an
organization
of
communities
that
furnish
--
mr.
israel
treiman
yes.
i
don't
deny
that
at
all.
fire
police
protection,
surely.
mr.
israel
treiman
right,
just
as
any
other
citizen.
i,
as
a
private
homeowner,
i
don't
have
to
be
a
subdivision
developer
to
have
that,
those
facilities
available
to
me.
i'm
sorry.
i've
see
the
red
light.
thank
you
for
your
patience.
