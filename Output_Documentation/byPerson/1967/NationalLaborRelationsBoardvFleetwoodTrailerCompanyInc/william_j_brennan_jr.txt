justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
scallon,
do
i
gather
that
if
these
were
in
fact
a
situation
of
temporary
unavailability,
you
would
concede
that
the
board
order
should
have
been
enforced?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
--
except
for
three
people?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
would
have
take
the
board
finding
in
that
respect
as
a
finding
that
this
was
a
temporary
unavailability
situation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
--
then
i
gather
the
--
on
the
universal
camera,
the
only
issue
for
the
court
of
appeals
are
that
whether
there
was
substantial
evidence
to
support
that
finding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
what
this
case
contend
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
come,
why
isn't
this
just
as
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
mr.
scallon
had
suggested,
nothing
except
a
question
whether
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
applied
universal
camera.
and
if
that's
all
it
is,
what
might
have
been
possibly
the
result?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
mr.
come
that
--
these
were
on
the
--
the
universal
camera
problem,
perhaps
i
shouldn't
say
again,
do
you
or
do
you
not
agree
--
if
only
universal
camera
then
--
right
or
wrong
is
--
does
universal
camera
contemplates
with
you
(inaudible)
into
your
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
we
done
that
often?
