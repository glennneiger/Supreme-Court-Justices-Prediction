mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
hereon
a
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit
to
review
the
judgment
of
that
court
denying
enforcement
of
the
board's
order
issued
against
the
respondent
company.
the
basic
question
presented
is
whether
an
employer
interferes
with
strike
activity
and
discriminates
against
strikers
in
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
where
he
treats
returning
strikers
as
having
lost
their
right
to
be
reemployed
ahead
of
new
employees
simply
because
on
the
day
that
they
asked
for
their
jobs
back,
those
jobs
are
temporarily
unavailable
due
to
a
reduction
in
production
caused
by
the
strike.
now,
the
basic
facts
are
briefly
these.
respondent
company
is
a
manufacturer
of
mobile
homes
in
california.
on
august
6th
of
1964,
as
a
result
of
a
breakdown
in
collective
bargaining
negotiations,
between
the
company
and
the
carpenter's
union
approximately
one-half
of
the
company,
the
108
employees,
went
out
in
support
--
went
out
on
strike
in
support
of
the
union's
demand.
that
was
an
economic
strike.
because
of
this
reduction
in
working
force,
the
company
cutback
its
production
schedule
which
had
been
about
20
units
per
week
to
10
units
per
week
and
curtailed
its
standing
orders
for
raw
materials
accordingly.
by
august
18,
the
company
hired
21
new
employees
and
some
of
the
strikers
had
returned
to
work
so
that
its
workforce
was
now
71
as
concurred
with
a
prestrike
level
of
about
108.
on
that
date,
the
union
accepted
the
company's
last
contract
offer,
terminated
the
strike
and
requested
reinstatement
of
the
remaining
strikers.
although
the
company
intended
to
increase
its
production
and
workforce
to
the
prestrike
level
as
soon
as
possible
and
i'll
come
back
to
that
later.
it
explains
that
the
union,
that
it
could
not,
right
at
that
moment,
handle
any
of
the
returning
strikers.
the
union
requested
that
the
strikers
be
put
on
a
preferential
hiring
list.
the
company
refused
saying
that
although
it
would
consider
them
for
openings
as
they
occurred,
if
desired,
they'll
remain
free
to
hire
from
the
outside
market
as
well.
on
august
20,
two
days
after
the
strike
ended,
six
strikers
applied
for
reemployment
and
on
a
number
of
occasions
thereafter,
they
renewed
their
applications
making
it
quite
clear
that
they
were
ready
and
able
to
return
for
work.
between
october
8
and
16,
the
company
hired
six
new
employees
for
jobs
which
the
striker
applicants
were
qualified
to
fill.
none
of
these
jobs
was
first
offered
to
the
strikers.
the
six
striker
applicants
were
reemployed
between
november
2nd
and
december
14th.
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
is
no
question
that
it
was
an
economic
strike,
not
an
unfair
labor
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
right
your
honor.
the
board
found
that
when
the
six
strikers
applied
for
reinstatement
at
the
end
of
the
strike,
they
had
not
been
permanently
replaced.
no
one
has
been
hired
to
fill
their
particular
jobs.
the
board
further
found
that
the
lack
of
immediate
openings
at
that
time
was
a
temporary
condition
which
the
company
knew
would
change
and
intended
to
change
was
its
purpose
later
achieved
to
return
to
full
production
and
to
a
full
crew
as
soon
as
practicable.
the
board
concluded
that
in
these
circumstances,
the
strikers
were
entitled
to
be
reinstated,
a
job
when
it
came
open
and
then
when
the
company
failed
to
do
that
in
october
and
instead
hired
new
employees,
the
company
discriminated
against
the
strikers
in
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(1)
and
(3)
of
the
act.
the
board
ordered
the
company
to
cease
and
desist
from
its
unfair
labor
practices
and
to
reimburse
the
strikers
for
any
loss
of
earnings
attributable
to
the
failure
to
hire
them
in
october.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor.
i
submit
that
it
is
more
than
a
question
of
fact
because
what
the
court
has
done
here
is
to
treat
a
temporary
job
unavailability
as
the
equivalent
of
a
job
--
as
the
equivalent
of
a
permanent
job
abolition.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
a
question
of
law
which
has
very
serious
impact
upon
the
right
to
strike.
the
reason
that
the
court
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
now,
the
--
under
the
board
decision,
the
board
was
not
have
found
that
the
refusal
to
take
them
back
when
they
first
applied
in
august
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
it
might
have
a
case
of
subsequent
discrimination
if
they
had
a
continuing
application.
but
had
there
been
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
a
permanent
replacement
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
or
a
permanent
job
abolition
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
board
would
not
have
found
a
violation
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
now,
what
you
had
here
was
nothing
like
that
and
it
is
so
substantially
different
on
those
two
situations
and
we
submit
that
it
does
present
a
very
basic
legal
question.
i
would
like
to
illustrate
what
i'm
talking
about
here.
now,
this
was
not
under
mackay,
there
is
no
question
that
in
an
economic
strike,
the
employer
would
have
a
right
to
hire
permanent
replacements.
now
this
was
not
--
despite
the
fact
that
the
respondent
here
talks
of
this
as
though
it
were
a
situation
of
replacement,
this
is
not
a
mackay
situation.
by
that,
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
respondent
did
not
show
in
this
record
that
it
was
his
obligation
to
do.
he
didn't
hire
any
particular
person
to
replace
the
new
strikers.
i
think
that
that's
quite
apparent
on
the
letter
which
the
respondent's
counsel
wrote
to
the
union
which
appears
at
page
81
of
the
record
where
he
says,
“since
we
did
not
hire
nearly
as
many
replacements
as
the
number
of
persons
on
strike,
it's
really
impossible
to
supply
a
statement
indicating
which
individual
strikers
the
new
employees
replaced.
and
similarly,
the
plant
manager
at
page
62
of
the
record
said
that
as
to
who
replace
who,
it
is
difficult
to
say.
but
as
to
what
man
filled,
what
man's
position
on
page
63,
i
can't
honestly
say
these
men
were
hired
in
preparation
for
increasing
the
production
and
getting
it
backed
up.
in
other
words,
the
company
was
in
the
process
of
expanding
its
production
back
to
the
pre-war
level
even
--
no,
it
hired
some
new
employees.
it
was
still
well
below
at
least
over
30
jobs
below
of
the
pre-war
compliment
which
it
was
intending
to
get
up.
there
was
no
replacement
in
--
on
mackay,
nor
was
there
any
permanent
job
abolition
in
the
sense
that
the
prior
cases
have
regarded
as
legally
sufficient
to
be
the
equivalent
of
--
to
be
sufficient
could
deprive
the
employees
of
their
employee
status.
because
after
all,
what
we
have
to
set
is
again
is
to
require
of
course
specific
provisions
in
section
2
(3)
of
the
act
which
says
that
an
employee
on
strike
has
not
lose
his
status
as
an
employee.
you
have
to
have
something
--
a
very
substantial
before
it
is
going
to
rise
to
a
stature
of
being
sufficient,
could
deprive
the
employee
of
his
employee
--
a
striker
of
his
status
as
an
employee.
a
permanent
replacement
is
one
of
those
things.
yes,
permanent
job
abolition
is
another
one.
now,
let
us
examine
that.
with
respect
to
that,
we
have
the
credited
testimony
here
of
the
plant
manager,
mr.
chapman,
on
page
51
of
the
record
in
which
he
is
asked,
“did
you
subsequently
increased
your
program
production
of
units?”
he
answered,
“yes,
we
did,
for
the
purpose
of
purchasing
and
getting
reorganized,
we
agree
that
we
would
--
say,
programs
10
units
a
week
until
we
found
out
how
things
was
going.
but
it
was
our
intention
to
get
back
the
flow
production
as
soon
as
possible”.
and
he
repeats
the
same
thought
on
page
17
--
57
of
the
record.
you
did
intend
at
all
times
to
get
production
as
quick
as
possible
up
to
20
trailers
a
week,
correct.
so
here
is
a
situation
where
at
the
time
the
strikers
asked
for
their
jobs
back,
on
august
20,
those
jobs
were
not
filled
by
anyone
that
was
hired
during
the
strike
as
replacement
for
the
strikers
nor
could
it
fairly
be
said
that
in
any
realistic
sense,
those
jobs
had
been
abolished.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
the
kind
of
situation
they
think
your
honor
because
what
i'm
getting
through
now
and
the
last
analysis,
what
we
have
here
is
a
problem
of
balancing
the
action
of
the
employer
against
its
effects
upon
the
rights
to
strike.
and
since
--
what
occured
here
is
likely
to
be
a
situation
in
most
strikes
to
regard
this
kind
of
a
temporary
job
unavailability.
it's
wiping
out
the
striker's
employee
status
is
inherently
disruptive
of
the
right
to
strike
and
is
trying
to
mean
that
in
virtually
every
strike,
a
striker
is
going
to
run
the
risk
of
this
kind,
the
loss
of
his
employment
status.
it
is
a
far
more
devastating
than
the
right
of
permanent
replacement
which
is
recognized
in
mackay
because
after
all,
permanent
replacement
depends
upon
a
number
of
variables.
it
depends
upon
the
nature
of
the
labor
market
at
the
time
of
the
strike,
the
skills
that
the
strikers
possessed.
there's
no
(inaudible)
that
the
strikers
are
going
to
be
replaced
by
going
on
a
strike.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
the
anomaly,
if
you
adopt
the
principle
of
the
court's
norms
that
this
kind
of
temporary
job
unavailability
is
enough
to
supply
the
employee
--
the
strikers
of
their
employee
status
is
that
the
more
effective
the
strike,
the
more
likely
the
strikers
are
going
to
find
that
their
employment
status
is
going
to
be
lost
because
it
would
take
the
employer
a
little
longer
to
get
back
into
production.
to
give
the
best
example,
if
the
strikers
are
wholly
successful
to
get
everybody
in
the
plant
out,
they
offer
to
come
back
two
weeks
earlier,
it's
going
to
be
most
(inaudible).
the
employer
was
not
able
to
hire
any
replacements
at
all,
he's
not
going
to
be
able
to
open
up
that
day
or
the
next
day.
its
going
to
take
him
a
couple
days
and
under
the
principle
of
the
court
below
here,
those
strikers
lose
their
employee
status.
we
submit
that,
as
far
as
recognized
that
the
board
(inaudible)
strike
the
balance
of
the
--
the
balance
of
the
board
confronts
here
is
defining
that
this
kind
of
a
job
unavailability
is
not
an
opportunity
to
deprive
the
strikers
of
theiremployment
status.
and
(inaudible)
could
have
been
(inaudible).
and
i
should
point
out
that
one
has
got
(inaudible)
taking
this
important
law.
i
think
it
is
important
to
(inaudible)
probably
thrown
off
basically
by
(inaudible)
of
the
board
and
i
think
that
those
(inaudible)
distinguishable
on
their
fact
that
the
holdings
of
--
it
is
(inaudible).
mr.
norton
j.
come
(inaudible)
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
what
we
had
is
the
board's
decision.
the
board
forced
on
the
(inaudible)
mr.
norton
j.
come
(inaudible)
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
filed
(inaudible)
decision
on
page
87,
footnote
4,
(inaudible).
i
think
this
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
(inaudible)
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
understand
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
intended
to
answer
that
question
first
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
is
not
a
pure
fact
question
for
the
reason
that
the
chief
justice
has
suggested,
namely,
you
look
at
the
court's
opinion
on
page
100,
the
last
paragraph.
“with
such
an
intent
directed
to
the
future
is
not
the
determinative
of
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
jobs
had
been
abolished,
tested
as
of
the
date
when
the
strikers
applied
for
work”.
i
think
that
the
court
in
finding
contrary
to
the
board
in
here
that
these
jobs
had
been
abolished,
did
so
under
the
erroneous
legal
premise.
if
you
will
look
only
at
the
situation,
on
the
day
that
the
strikers
come
back,
now
once
you
eliminate
that
premise,
i
submit,
that
the
court
of
appeals
probably
would
have
and
indeed
should
have
sustained
the
board's
finding,
because
on
this
record,
it's
quite
clear,
you'll
had
only
a
temporary
job
unavailability
to
--
specifically
to
strike
conditions.
there
is
no
suggestion
here
that
there
was
any
change
in
market
demand.
the
vice-president,
mr.
weidy
(ph)
testified
in
the
record
here
at
pages
37
and
38
that
the
reasons
that
they
were
not
able
to
pick
up
immediately
was
a
two-fold
one.
one,
so
the
people
that
they
hired
during
the
strike,
the
new
people
were
untrained.
they
needed
to
be
trained.
secondly,
orders
for
raw
materials
had
been
cancelled
during
the
strike
and
it
took
30
days
to
refill
them.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that's
right.
of
course,
universal
camera
has
the
safety
valve
that
where
you
have
a
situation
where
the
court
has
so
grossly
applied
it,
this
court
will
step
in.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
you
have
not
done
it
often.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
the
reason
they
made
that
finding
is
because
they
were
operating
under
the
erroneous
legal
principle
that
they
set
forth
on
page
a
100
before
they
get
to
that
conclusion.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
there
would
be
no
violation
either.
now,
with
regard
to
this
five-month
business,
this
is
not
a
five-month
situation.
the
--
it's
true
they
didn't
get
up
to
full
levels
of
the
production
until
five
months.
but
they
started
picking
up
within
six
weeks
when
they
made
their
first
hires.
they
hired
--
they
took
back
--
they
hired
three
new
people
and
there
was
no
showing
that
they
were
any
better
qualified
than
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
three
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
with
respect
to
that
your
honor
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
the
court
has
dealt
with
it
by
finding
that
none
of
the
people
that
were
hired
during
the
strike
were
replacements
for
any
of
the
strikers
because
the
company
did
not
indicate
that
they
had
replaced
any
particular
striker
and
who
was
in
the
process
of
expanding
its
workforce.
so
therefore,
the
threat
--
the
inference
that
the
board
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
but
the
point
is
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
is
correct
but
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
because
the
strikers'
jobs
were
not
filled
because
the
company
had
a
work
compliment
of
a
108
before
the
strike
and
they
were
going
to
a
108
at
all
times
and
they
ultimately
reached
that.
now
the
fact
that
they
have
71
jobs
filled,
leave
at
least
30
some
odd
that
remained
to
be
filled.
and
there
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
there
were
only
six
strikers
here
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
oh,
i
submit
that
the
burden
is
upon
the
company
to
show
that
that
is
not
so.
that
that
law
presumes
it
as
that's
so
--
that
that
is
so,
unless
the
company
is
able
to
establish
as
they
were
unable
to
do
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
they
were
unable
to
do
that
on
this
record
and
in
the
passages
that
i
read
you.
now,
with
respect
to
the
board
cases,
i
just
want
to
say
this
mr.
justice
stewart.
it
is
in
quite
as
flat
as
i
left
it,
not
only
did
the
trial
examiner
indicate
that
the
brown
and
root
case
was
factually
distinguishable.
he
cited
the
case
there
called
(inaudible).
and
in
that
board
case,
the
board
draw
the
distinction
between
strikers
who
are
permanently
replaced
and
those
who
are
not
permanently
replaced.
and
it
points
out
that
with
respect
to
those
who
are
not
permanently
replaced
the
employer
is
under
a
duty
to
recall
them
as
work
becomes
available.
we
submit
that
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
on
what
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
on
that
issue
the
--
an
issue
was
raised
however
by
the
position
of
the
afl-cio,
i
believe
(voice
overlap).
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
we
are
not
espousing
that
position.
but
this
is
not
a
case
of
permanent
replacement
in
the
mackay
sense.
thank
you.
mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
hereon
a
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit
to
review
the
judgment
of
that
court
denying
enforcement
of
the
board's
order
issued
against
the
respondent
company.
the
basic
question
presented
is
whether
an
employer
interferes
with
strike
activity
and
discriminates
against
strikers
in
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
where
he
treats
returning
strikers
as
having
lost
their
right
to
be
reemployed
ahead
of
new
employees
simply
because
on
the
day
that
they
asked
for
their
jobs
back,
those
jobs
are
temporarily
unavailable
due
to
a
reduction
in
production
caused
by
the
strike.
now,
the
basic
facts
are
briefly
these.
respondent
company
is
a
manufacturer
of
mobile
homes
in
california.
on
august
6th
of
1964,
as
a
result
of
a
breakdown
in
collective
bargaining
negotiations,
between
the
company
and
the
carpenter's
union
approximately
one-half
of
the
company,
the
108
employees,
went
out
in
support
--
went
out
on
strike
in
support
of
the
union's
demand.
that
was
an
economic
strike.
because
of
this
reduction
in
working
force,
the
company
cutback
its
production
schedule
which
had
been
about
20
units
per
week
to
10
units
per
week
and
curtailed
its
standing
orders
for
raw
materials
accordingly.
by
august
18,
the
company
hired
21
new
employees
and
some
of
the
strikers
had
returned
to
work
so
that
its
workforce
was
now
71
as
concurred
with
a
prestrike
level
of
about
108.
on
that
date,
the
union
accepted
the
company's
last
contract
offer,
terminated
the
strike
and
requested
reinstatement
of
the
remaining
strikers.
although
the
company
intended
to
increase
its
production
and
workforce
to
the
prestrike
level
as
soon
as
possible
and
i'll
come
back
to
that
later.
it
explains
that
the
union,
that
it
could
not,
right
at
that
moment,
handle
any
of
the
returning
strikers.
the
union
requested
that
the
strikers
be
put
on
a
preferential
hiring
list.
the
company
refused
saying
that
although
it
would
consider
them
for
openings
as
they
occurred,
if
desired,
they'll
remain
free
to
hire
from
the
outside
market
as
well.
on
august
20,
two
days
after
the
strike
ended,
six
strikers
applied
for
reemployment
and
on
a
number
of
occasions
thereafter,
they
renewed
their
applications
making
it
quite
clear
that
they
were
ready
and
able
to
return
for
work.
between
october
8
and
16,
the
company
hired
six
new
employees
for
jobs
which
the
striker
applicants
were
qualified
to
fill.
none
of
these
jobs
was
first
offered
to
the
strikers.
the
six
striker
applicants
were
reemployed
between
november
2nd
and
december
14th.
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
is
no
question
that
it
was
an
economic
strike,
not
an
unfair
labor
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
right
your
honor.
the
board
found
that
when
the
six
strikers
applied
for
reinstatement
at
the
end
of
the
strike,
they
had
not
been
permanently
replaced.
no
one
has
been
hired
to
fill
their
particular
jobs.
the
board
further
found
that
the
lack
of
immediate
openings
at
that
time
was
a
temporary
condition
which
the
company
knew
would
change
and
intended
to
change
was
its
purpose
later
achieved
to
return
to
full
production
and
to
a
full
crew
as
soon
as
practicable.
the
board
concluded
that
in
these
circumstances,
the
strikers
were
entitled
to
be
reinstated,
a
job
when
it
came
open
and
then
when
the
company
failed
to
do
that
in
october
and
instead
hired
new
employees,
the
company
discriminated
against
the
strikers
in
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(1)
and
(3)
of
the
act.
the
board
ordered
the
company
to
cease
and
desist
from
its
unfair
labor
practices
and
to
reimburse
the
strikers
for
any
loss
of
earnings
attributable
to
the
failure
to
hire
them
in
october.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor.
i
submit
that
it
is
more
than
a
question
of
fact
because
what
the
court
has
done
here
is
to
treat
a
temporary
job
unavailability
as
the
equivalent
of
a
job
--
as
the
equivalent
of
a
permanent
job
abolition.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
a
question
of
law
which
has
very
serious
impact
upon
the
right
to
strike.
the
reason
that
the
court
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
now,
the
--
under
the
board
decision,
the
board
was
not
have
found
that
the
refusal
to
take
them
back
when
they
first
applied
in
august
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
it
might
have
a
case
of
subsequent
discrimination
if
they
had
a
continuing
application.
but
had
there
been
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
a
permanent
replacement
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
or
a
permanent
job
abolition
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
board
would
not
have
found
a
violation
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
now,
what
you
had
here
was
nothing
like
that
and
it
is
so
substantially
different
on
those
two
situations
and
we
submit
that
it
does
present
a
very
basic
legal
question.
i
would
like
to
illustrate
what
i'm
talking
about
here.
now,
this
was
not
under
mackay,
there
is
no
question
that
in
an
economic
strike,
the
employer
would
have
a
right
to
hire
permanent
replacements.
now
this
was
not
--
despite
the
fact
that
the
respondent
here
talks
of
this
as
though
it
were
a
situation
of
replacement,
this
is
not
a
mackay
situation.
by
that,
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
respondent
did
not
show
in
this
record
that
it
was
his
obligation
to
do.
he
didn't
hire
any
particular
person
to
replace
the
new
strikers.
i
think
that
that's
quite
apparent
on
the
letter
which
the
respondent's
counsel
wrote
to
the
union
which
appears
at
page
81
of
the
record
where
he
says,
“since
we
did
not
hire
nearly
as
many
replacements
as
the
number
of
persons
on
strike,
it's
really
impossible
to
supply
a
statement
indicating
which
individual
strikers
the
new
employees
replaced.
and
similarly,
the
plant
manager
at
page
62
of
the
record
said
that
as
to
who
replace
who,
it
is
difficult
to
say.
but
as
to
what
man
filled,
what
man's
position
on
page
63,
i
can't
honestly
say
these
men
were
hired
in
preparation
for
increasing
the
production
and
getting
it
backed
up.
in
other
words,
the
company
was
in
the
process
of
expanding
its
production
back
to
the
pre-war
level
even
--
no,
it
hired
some
new
employees.
it
was
still
well
below
at
least
over
30
jobs
below
of
the
pre-war
compliment
which
it
was
intending
to
get
up.
there
was
no
replacement
in
--
on
mackay,
nor
was
there
any
permanent
job
abolition
in
the
sense
that
the
prior
cases
have
regarded
as
legally
sufficient
to
be
the
equivalent
of
--
to
be
sufficient
could
deprive
the
employees
of
their
employee
status.
because
after
all,
what
we
have
to
set
is
again
is
to
require
of
course
specific
provisions
in
section
2
(3)
of
the
act
which
says
that
an
employee
on
strike
has
not
lose
his
status
as
an
employee.
you
have
to
have
something
--
a
very
substantial
before
it
is
going
to
rise
to
a
stature
of
being
sufficient,
could
deprive
the
employee
of
his
employee
--
a
striker
of
his
status
as
an
employee.
a
permanent
replacement
is
one
of
those
things.
yes,
permanent
job
abolition
is
another
one.
now,
let
us
examine
that.
with
respect
to
that,
we
have
the
credited
testimony
here
of
the
plant
manager,
mr.
chapman,
on
page
51
of
the
record
in
which
he
is
asked,
“did
you
subsequently
increased
your
program
production
of
units?”
he
answered,
“yes,
we
did,
for
the
purpose
of
purchasing
and
getting
reorganized,
we
agree
that
we
would
--
say,
programs
10
units
a
week
until
we
found
out
how
things
was
going.
but
it
was
our
intention
to
get
back
the
flow
production
as
soon
as
possible”.
and
he
repeats
the
same
thought
on
page
17
--
57
of
the
record.
you
did
intend
at
all
times
to
get
production
as
quick
as
possible
up
to
20
trailers
a
week,
correct.
so
here
is
a
situation
where
at
the
time
the
strikers
asked
for
their
jobs
back,
on
august
20,
those
jobs
were
not
filled
by
anyone
that
was
hired
during
the
strike
as
replacement
for
the
strikers
nor
could
it
fairly
be
said
that
in
any
realistic
sense,
those
jobs
had
been
abolished.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
the
kind
of
situation
they
think
your
honor
because
what
i'm
getting
through
now
and
the
last
analysis,
what
we
have
here
is
a
problem
of
balancing
the
action
of
the
employer
against
its
effects
upon
the
rights
to
strike.
and
since
--
what
occured
here
is
likely
to
be
a
situation
in
most
strikes
to
regard
this
kind
of
a
temporary
job
unavailability.
it's
wiping
out
the
striker's
employee
status
is
inherently
disruptive
of
the
right
to
strike
and
is
trying
to
mean
that
in
virtually
every
strike,
a
striker
is
going
to
run
the
risk
of
this
kind,
the
loss
of
his
employment
status.
it
is
a
far
more
devastating
than
the
right
of
permanent
replacement
which
is
recognized
in
mackay
because
after
all,
permanent
replacement
depends
upon
a
number
of
variables.
it
depends
upon
the
nature
of
the
labor
market
at
the
time
of
the
strike,
the
skills
that
the
strikers
possessed.
there's
no
(inaudible)
that
the
strikers
are
going
to
be
replaced
by
going
on
a
strike.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
the
anomaly,
if
you
adopt
the
principle
of
the
court's
norms
that
this
kind
of
temporary
job
unavailability
is
enough
to
supply
the
employee
--
the
strikers
of
their
employee
status
is
that
the
more
effective
the
strike,
the
more
likely
the
strikers
are
going
to
find
that
their
employment
status
is
going
to
be
lost
because
it
would
take
the
employer
a
little
longer
to
get
back
into
production.
to
give
the
best
example,
if
the
strikers
are
wholly
successful
to
get
everybody
in
the
plant
out,
they
offer
to
come
back
two
weeks
earlier,
it's
going
to
be
most
(inaudible).
the
employer
was
not
able
to
hire
any
replacements
at
all,
he's
not
going
to
be
able
to
open
up
that
day
or
the
next
day.
its
going
to
take
him
a
couple
days
and
under
the
principle
of
the
court
below
here,
those
strikers
lose
their
employee
status.
we
submit
that,
as
far
as
recognized
that
the
board
(inaudible)
strike
the
balance
of
the
--
the
balance
of
the
board
confronts
here
is
defining
that
this
kind
of
a
job
unavailability
is
not
an
opportunity
to
deprive
the
strikers
of
theiremployment
status.
and
(inaudible)
could
have
been
(inaudible).
and
i
should
point
out
that
one
has
got
(inaudible)
taking
this
important
law.
i
think
it
is
important
to
(inaudible)
probably
thrown
off
basically
by
(inaudible)
of
the
board
and
i
think
that
those
(inaudible)
distinguishable
on
their
fact
that
the
holdings
of
--
it
is
(inaudible).
mr.
norton
j.
come
(inaudible)
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
what
we
had
is
the
board's
decision.
the
board
forced
on
the
(inaudible)
mr.
norton
j.
come
(inaudible)
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
filed
(inaudible)
decision
on
page
87,
footnote
4,
(inaudible).
i
think
this
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
(inaudible)
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
understand
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
intended
to
answer
that
question
first
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
is
not
a
pure
fact
question
for
the
reason
that
the
chief
justice
has
suggested,
namely,
you
look
at
the
court's
opinion
on
page
100,
the
last
paragraph.
“with
such
an
intent
directed
to
the
future
is
not
the
determinative
of
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
jobs
had
been
abolished,
tested
as
of
the
date
when
the
strikers
applied
for
work”.
i
think
that
the
court
in
finding
contrary
to
the
board
in
here
that
these
jobs
had
been
abolished,
did
so
under
the
erroneous
legal
premise.
if
you
will
look
only
at
the
situation,
on
the
day
that
the
strikers
come
back,
now
once
you
eliminate
that
premise,
i
submit,
that
the
court
of
appeals
probably
would
have
and
indeed
should
have
sustained
the
board's
finding,
because
on
this
record,
it's
quite
clear,
you'll
had
only
a
temporary
job
unavailability
to
--
specifically
to
strike
conditions.
there
is
no
suggestion
here
that
there
was
any
change
in
market
demand.
the
vice-president,
mr.
weidy
(ph)
testified
in
the
record
here
at
pages
37
and
38
that
the
reasons
that
they
were
not
able
to
pick
up
immediately
was
a
two-fold
one.
one,
so
the
people
that
they
hired
during
the
strike,
the
new
people
were
untrained.
they
needed
to
be
trained.
secondly,
orders
for
raw
materials
had
been
cancelled
during
the
strike
and
it
took
30
days
to
refill
them.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that's
right.
of
course,
universal
camera
has
the
safety
valve
that
where
you
have
a
situation
where
the
court
has
so
grossly
applied
it,
this
court
will
step
in.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
you
have
not
done
it
often.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
the
reason
they
made
that
finding
is
because
they
were
operating
under
the
erroneous
legal
principle
that
they
set
forth
on
page
a
100
before
they
get
to
that
conclusion.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
there
would
be
no
violation
either.
now,
with
regard
to
this
five-month
business,
this
is
not
a
five-month
situation.
the
--
it's
true
they
didn't
get
up
to
full
levels
of
the
production
until
five
months.
but
they
started
picking
up
within
six
weeks
when
they
made
their
first
hires.
they
hired
--
they
took
back
--
they
hired
three
new
people
and
there
was
no
showing
that
they
were
any
better
qualified
than
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
three
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
with
respect
to
that
your
honor
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
the
court
has
dealt
with
it
by
finding
that
none
of
the
people
that
were
hired
during
the
strike
were
replacements
for
any
of
the
strikers
because
the
company
did
not
indicate
that
they
had
replaced
any
particular
striker
and
who
was
in
the
process
of
expanding
its
workforce.
so
therefore,
the
threat
--
the
inference
that
the
board
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
but
the
point
is
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
is
correct
but
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
because
the
strikers'
jobs
were
not
filled
because
the
company
had
a
work
compliment
of
a
108
before
the
strike
and
they
were
going
to
a
108
at
all
times
and
they
ultimately
reached
that.
now
the
fact
that
they
have
71
jobs
filled,
leave
at
least
30
some
odd
that
remained
to
be
filled.
and
there
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
there
were
only
six
strikers
here
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
oh,
i
submit
that
the
burden
is
upon
the
company
to
show
that
that
is
not
so.
that
that
law
presumes
it
as
that's
so
--
that
that
is
so,
unless
the
company
is
able
to
establish
as
they
were
unable
to
do
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
they
were
unable
to
do
that
on
this
record
and
in
the
passages
that
i
read
you.
now,
with
respect
to
the
board
cases,
i
just
want
to
say
this
mr.
justice
stewart.
it
is
in
quite
as
flat
as
i
left
it,
not
only
did
the
trial
examiner
indicate
that
the
brown
and
root
case
was
factually
distinguishable.
he
cited
the
case
there
called
(inaudible).
and
in
that
board
case,
the
board
draw
the
distinction
between
strikers
who
are
permanently
replaced
and
those
who
are
not
permanently
replaced.
and
it
points
out
that
with
respect
to
those
who
are
not
permanently
replaced
the
employer
is
under
a
duty
to
recall
them
as
work
becomes
available.
we
submit
that
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
on
what
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
on
that
issue
the
--
an
issue
was
raised
however
by
the
position
of
the
afl-cio,
i
believe
(voice
overlap).
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
we
are
not
espousing
that
position.
but
this
is
not
a
case
of
permanent
replacement
in
the
mackay
sense.
thank
you.
