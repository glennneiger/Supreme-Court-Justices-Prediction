mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
has
shown
itself
familiar
with
the
basic
facts
in
this
case
which
are
substantially
as
outlined
by
mr.
come.
the
factual
nature
of
this
dispute,
i
think
is
made
very
clear
if
i
may
simply
quote
one
sentence
each
from
the
decision
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit.
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
this
appears
in
the
record
at
page
87
said,
“none
of
the
six
had
been
permanently
replaced.
the
lack
of
job
openings
on
august
20th
was
a
temporary
condition”.
the
ninth
circuit
on
review
and
specifically
quoting
the
language
on
scope
of
review
from
universal
camera,
stated,
“the
record
demonstrates
that
the
jobs
had
been
abolished
or
absorbed
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time
and
only
later
were
they
recreated."
this
is
basically
the
issue
of
this
case,
the
fact
issue
whether
these
jobs
had
been
permanently
abolished
or
only
temporarily
unavailable.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
the
second
quotation
appears
at
page
101
of
the
record
your
honor.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
well,
we
take
two
positions
on
that
sir.
the
first
one
is
that
this
definitely
goes
to
show
that
what
we
had
had
here
was
not
a
temporary
aba
--
temporary
displacement
of
jobs
due
to
the
strike.
actually,
two
months
after
the
strike,
employment
was
still
decreasing.
in
spite
of
the
fact,
and
the
ninth
circuit
specifically
cited
the
record
on
this
account
that
the
--
a
record
shows
that
all
strike
associated
disabilities
were
cured
or
were
curable
within
30
days,
the
training
of
employees
and
getting
supplies
and
so
on.
now
this
proves
that
what
we
had
here
was
an
abolishment
due
to
an
economic
state
of
affairs.
essentially,
it
was
nothing
but
a
layoff
which
happened
to
coincide
with
a
strike.
and
second
of
all,
we
would
point
out
that
to
the
extent
that
there
was
a
decrease
of
employment,
these
new
job
openings
that
occurred
in
october
were
really
nothing
but
filling
the
place
of
permanent
replacements.
and
it's
well
established
that
there
is
no
right
to
preference
on
the
part
of
strikers
with
it
then
replaced
to
--
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
that's
right,
the
labor
board
--
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
the
labor
board
did
not
deal
with
it.
the
court
of
appeals
did
deal
with
it
and
has
treated
it
in
this
way
that
to
that
extent
they
were
--
did
constitute
nothing
but
a
replacement
of
replacements.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
well
--
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
five
months
is
a
long
time
your
honor
in
the
industrial
market.
this
strike
occurred
in
august,
this
prestrike
production
or
this
is
what
you
might
call
a
prestrike
production
level
and
there's
really
no
magic
in
saying
that
there
was
a
110
employees
and
20
units
before
the
strike.
but
even
so,
this
level
was
not
achieved
until
five
months
after
the
end
of
the
strike
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
this
represented
a
calculated
regrouping
of
the
--
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
that's
right
your
honor.
and
if
--
but
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
and
this
appears
at
page
100
of
the
record,
that
these
four
lines
which
were
reported
by
the
--
by
mr.
come,
really
were
addressed
to
nothing
more
than
big
intentions
as
to
future
plans.
the
specific
test
to
the
specific
course
of
events
however
was
that
the
production
had
remained
--
it
was
actually
slightly
less
than
their
capacity
at
the
end
of
the
strike
two
months
later.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
oh,
yes
sir.
we
stipulated
that
--
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
that
is
right
your
honor
--
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
that
stipulation
appears
in
the
record
in
this
brief.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
i
feel
that
--
that
was
their
finding
of
the
fact.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
that's
right
sir.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
yes
sir.
and
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
supported
universal
camera
and
in
this
court
there
is
no
contention
by
the
petitioner
that
the
ninth
circuit
misapplied
universal
camera.
now,
under
--
question
of
the
board
president,
the
petitioner's
brief
and
mr.
come
here
today
could
only
distinguish
them
on
the
grounds
and
i'm
quoting
from
his
brief
now,
“the
strikers'
jobs
had
in
effect
been
abolished”.
now
that
is
precisely
the
very
question
which
the
board
itself
said
it
was
determining,
which
the
ninth
circuit
said
it
was
determining
so
that
they
cannot
constitute
a
valid
distinction
of
those
cases.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
now,
although
not
addressed
to
an
oral
argument
here,
the
petitioner
suggest
that
a
different
result
might
be
compelled
in
this
case
because
of
this
court's
recent
decision
in
the
great
dane
case
which
holds
that
given
the
discriminatory
act
by
an
employer,
that
an
intent
to
discourage
membership
in
a
union
organization
in
its
broad
sense
can
be
inferred
in
the
burden
of
proof
shifts
to
the
employer
to
justify
his
action.
now,
we
submit
that
great
dane
is
not
applicable
to
this
case
for
these
three
reasons.
first
of
all,
as
mr.
come
said
this
morning,
the
labor
board
concedes
that
no
preference
is
required
for
strikers
whose
jobs
had
been
abolished,
now
i
submit
that
it
couldn't
have
been
the
intent
of
great
dane
to
require
an
employer
to
justify
an
action
which
the
labor
board
concedes
as
a
matter
of
law
it
had
a
right
to
do.
secondly,
and
probably
recognizing
the
foregoing,
the
law
of
the
labor
board
in
it's
own
brief
here
only
applies
great
dane
to
unreplaced
economic
strikers.
that
appears
in
their
brief
at
page
10.
now,
as
i
indicated,
we
stipulated
at
the
hearing
orally
to
--
on
the
record
and
we
have
contended
ever
since
that
if
the
strikers'
positions
had
not
been
permanently
abolished,
they
were
entitled
to
preference.
but
if
they
had
been
permanently
abolished,
they
were
not
entitled
to
preference.
but
again,
this
turns
on
that
fact
issue.
there
is
even
however
--
i
think
a
more
fundamental
reason
why
great
dane
is
not
applicable
to
this
case.
and
i
think
--
and
it
goes
to
the
whole
heart
of
the
government's
action.
in
great
dane,
the
--
an
employer
on
july
12th
suddenly
announced
that
back
as
of
july
1,
vacation
eligibility
would
be
determined.
the
result
was
that
the
strikers
were
not
eligible
for
vacation,
nonstrikers
were.
at
least
in
the
opinion
of
the
majority,
this
was
a
clear
case
of
discrimination
and
the
court
to
hold
it
to
both
of
its
opinion
to
the
issue
of
intent
and
burden
of
proof
in
that
regard.
now,
the
court
pointed
out
in
great
dane
an
8
(a)
(3)
violation
consisted
two
elements,
ithas
to
have
the
discriminatory
act
and
there
has
to
have
the
intent
to
discourage
union
activity.
here,
we
do
not
have
the
first
element
of
the
8
(a)
violation,
a
discrimination.
as
the
record
shows
the
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
so
found,
what
we
had
here
was
really
a
permanent
cutback
of
operations
and
these
strikers
were
unemployed
as
a
result
of
a
permanent
cutback.
and
this
doesn't
constitute
a
discrimination,
and
again,
i
--
i
think
the
best
statement
of
why
it
doesn't
constitute
a
discrimination
appears
in
the
petitioner's
brief
where
they
say
and
i'm
quoting,
this
is
at
page
15,
“where
there's
always
a
risk
that
changes
in
economic
conditions
or
inefficiency
of
production
may
prompt
the
elimination
of
the
jobs
that
some
employees
hold.
and
still
another
argument,
what
seems
to
me
to
be
basically
inconsistent
incidentally
with
the
board's
acceptance
of
the
general
principle
of
permanent
abolishment
constitutes
replacement,
the
petitioner
here
suggests
that
we
should
be
compelled
to
establish
a
preferential
hire
list
because
the
employer
might
use
an
economic
cutback
as
a
deliberate
subterfuge
to
pun
--
to
continue
to
punish
strikers
after
the
strike
is
over.
now,
this
i
submit
is
just
another
way
of
raising
a
fact
issue.
it
goes
to
the
question
whether
there
was
in
fact
abolishment
or
whether
there
is
a
deliberate
withholding
of
the
position
from
the
employees.
i'd
like
to
point
out
here,
that
the
hearing
examiner
found,
the
labor
board
adopted
and
the
circuit
court
approved
the
finding
that
the
employer
had
no
conscious
intent
to
discriminate
against
these
employees.
its
discrimination
if
any
was
inadvertent
in
determining
whether
there
had
been
a
permanent
cutback
or
not.
turning
to
the
amicus
brief
and
so
far
as
it
goes
beyond
the
intentions
of
the
labor
board,
is
the
position
of
the
afl-cio
that
notwithstanding
the
entire
body
of
law
that
has
developed
under
the
mackay
radio
case
back
1938,
this
court
sua
sponte
should
establish
a
rule
that
an
employer
must
create
a
preferential
hire
list
or
striking
employees
regardless
of
the
business
conditions
and
so
on
that
exist
after
the
strike.
it
is
very
candid
in
its
brief
and
is
--
and
it
admits
that
the
contrary
rule
had
been
applied
and
i've
quote
without
exception
since
the
mackay
case
was
decided.
now,
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
the
court
should
not
act
on
the
suggestion
of
the
amicus
in
this
brief
or
in
this
case.
i'd
say
first
of
all,
that
this
is
not
the
type
of
case
that
this
court
decides
as
a
matter
of
first
impression.
this
is
a
highly
important
and
highly
--
very
noble
decision
that
should
not
be
made
without
the
--
without
prior
consideration
of
lower
levels.
as
this
court
said
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
which
i
quoted
in
my
brief,
followed
the
board's
decision
is
not
the
last
word,
it
must
assuredly
be
the
first.
second,
i
believe
the
contention
of
the
amicus
is
not
sound
in
law
either
in
the
language
of
the
statute
or
in
its
legislative
history.
first,
looking
specifically
at
the
language
of
the
statute,
section
9
(c)
(3)
deals
with
the
rights
of
strikers
who
have
been
replaced
and
speaks
specifically
in
terms
of
reinstatement.
section
9
(3)
--
(c)
(3)
simply
gives
them
a
very
limited
right,
the
right
to
vote
and
we
submit
that
the
limited
nature
of
this
grant
indicates
that
the
congress
did
not
have
in
mind
to
grant
them
any
additional
right
beyond
this
point.
second,
if
you
look
at
--
or
third
rather,
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
the
1947
and
1949
amendments
to
the
labor
management
relations
act,
there
are
twice
specific
reference
to
the
mackay
radio
case
and
is
significant,
the
language
that
the
spokesman
at
that
time
used
is
the
position
of
the
amicus
that
mackay
holds
nothing
more
than
that
an
employer
may
hire
permanent
replacements,
but
did
not
address
itself
to
the
question
of
what
the
right
of
those
persons
who
have
been
replaced
--
what
their
right
will
be
after
the
strike
is
over.
but
if
--
we're
referring
to
page
22
of
my
brief
where
the
pertinent
legislative
history
is
given,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
senate
report
number
1126
says
this,
“if
such
strike
is
an
economic
one
and
not
caused
by
an
unfair
labor
practice
of
the
employer,
strikers
permanently
replaced
have
no
right
to
reinstatement”.
in
other
words,
congress
at
this
point
had
recognized
the
further
extension
of
the
mackay
doctrine
that
it
not
only
give
the
employer
the
right
to
replace
but
hire
replacements,
but
it
also
terminated
the
rights
of
reinstatement
of
the
replaced
employees.
now,
that's
from
the
senate
--
that
is
from
the
report.
as
all
--
i
had
--
it's
very
significant,
although
it
comes
from
a
critique
of
the
bill,
senator
pepper
used
this
virtually
identical
language.
finally,
there
is
a
practical
reason
why
the
court
should
not
change
this
rule
at
this
stage
of
the
game.
this
has
been
the
virtually
universal
--
or
the
universal
rule
for
almost
30
years
and
employers
all
over
the
united
states
have
acted
in
reliance
on
these
rules
concerning
reinstatement.
now,
if
this
court
were
to
change
that
rule
today
and
apply
it
to
my
client,
essentially
on
a
retroactive
basis,
the
result
would
be
that
subject
only
to
the
statute
of
limitations,
every
employer
in
this
comp
--
in
this
country,
who
hired
as
of
--
which
might
call
off
the
seniority
list,
in
other
words
a
new
employee
would
be
subject
to
an
unfair
labor
practice
finding
and
the
substantial
back
pay
liability.
i've
cited
in
the
--
in
my
brief,
the
cases
in
this
court
which
point
out
that
when
there
has
been
a
long
reliance,
unchallenged
on
an
administrative
interpretation
of
an
act
that
this
court
will
not
likely
reverse
it.
i
have
nothing
more
unless
the
court
has
some
questions,
i
will
--
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
well,
i
think
your
question
mr.
justice
white
illustrates
the
very
factual
nature
of
this
case.
there's
no
--
there's
going
to
be
some
industries
in
which
you
can
put
people
back
to
work
the
very
next
day
doing
what
they
were
doing,
you've
had
a
repetitive
type
of
work
with
a
ready
market
for
it.
a
department
store
where
the
employees
can
walk
back
in
the
door
and
walk
behind
their
counters
and
ready
to
go
back
to
work.
it
may
have
a
contrary
situation
of
the
--
whether
the
maker
of
a
locomotive
factory
or
some
capital
goods
factory
in
which
heavily
dependent
on
orders
in
order
to
be
--
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
no
sir.
no,
we
had
never
made
that
contention
and
that
is
words
that
--
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
i
would
say
the
jobs
should
be
considered
available
are
those
which
--
once
the
employer
or
those
which
will
be
created
as
the
employer
recovers
from
the
effect
of
the
strike.
but
once
the
effect
of
the
strike
has
been
obviated
and
the
employer
then
continued,
then
he's
simply
is
in
the
position
of
--
as
if
there
had
been
a
layoff
for
instance.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
the
strike
did,
but
also
from
the
record,
apparently,
there
must
have
been
a
shift
in
the
market
because
as
i
say,
the
records
shows
and
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
the
effects
of
the
strike
were
overcome
in
30
days,
yet
the
employer
contend
--
continued
to
operate
at
that
reduced
level.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
that's
definitely
in
--
there's
--
the
record
would
indicate
that,
yes
sir.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
well,
the
court
of
appeals
quoted
some
language
from
the
brown
&
root
case
which
would
appear
to
establish
a
highly
arbitrary
cutoff.
it
says
that
essentially,
that
is
to
be
determined
as
of
the
day
that
the
strike
has
ended.
i
think
what
you
--
the
problem
there
is
a
little
bit
of
a
conceptual
one.
ordinarily,
the
question
whether
a
man
had
been
replaced
in
a
situation
of
abolishment
isn't
going
to
come
up
the
day
the
strike
ends.
it's
going
to
come
up
later
on
down
the
line
when
there
is
a
new
opening,
just
as
it
did
in
this
case.
that's
what
this
whole
case
is
about
when
you
get
on
down
the
line.
nevertheless,
the
status
of
the
employee
is
actually
determined
as
to
the
end
of
that
strike
--
but
you,
but
the
question
comes
up
and
the
evidence
to
which
the
court
looks
would
be
both
the
evidence
which
exist
on
the
day
that
the
strike
ends
and
also
subsequent
evidence.
and
the
opinions
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
a
good
illustration
of
this.
they
--
while
they
made
that
is
determined
as
of
august
20th,
they
didn't
went
on
to
point
out
to
see,
if
you
look
at
this,
the
employer
had
a
capacity
to
produce
15
units
at
the
end
of
the
strike,
two
months
later
it's
only
producing
14.
he
had
said
--
by
the
end
of
the
strike
he
had
71
employees.
two
months
later,
he
had
only
68.
in
other
words,
that
--
the
statement
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
to
be
taken
literally.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
no
sir.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
well,
i
think
sir
that
the
--
i
would
say
this,
that
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
clearly
shows
that
it
did
not
make
it
that
--
that
they
can't
make
it
under
that
determination
because
if
so,
all
this
information
about
what
happened
two
months
later
would
be
totally
irrelevant.
yet,
the
court
set
it
out
in
detail.
i
would
say
in
defense
of
the
ninth
circuit,
that
it
quoted
this
language
verbatim
from
the
decision
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
thank
you.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
has
shown
itself
familiar
with
the
basic
facts
in
this
case
which
are
substantially
as
outlined
by
mr.
come.
the
factual
nature
of
this
dispute,
i
think
is
made
very
clear
if
i
may
simply
quote
one
sentence
each
from
the
decision
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit.
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
this
appears
in
the
record
at
page
87
said,
“none
of
the
six
had
been
permanently
replaced.
the
lack
of
job
openings
on
august
20th
was
a
temporary
condition”.
the
ninth
circuit
on
review
and
specifically
quoting
the
language
on
scope
of
review
from
universal
camera,
stated,
“the
record
demonstrates
that
the
jobs
had
been
abolished
or
absorbed
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time
and
only
later
were
they
recreated."
this
is
basically
the
issue
of
this
case,
the
fact
issue
whether
these
jobs
had
been
permanently
abolished
or
only
temporarily
unavailable.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
the
second
quotation
appears
at
page
101
of
the
record
your
honor.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
well,
we
take
two
positions
on
that
sir.
the
first
one
is
that
this
definitely
goes
to
show
that
what
we
had
had
here
was
not
a
temporary
aba
--
temporary
displacement
of
jobs
due
to
the
strike.
actually,
two
months
after
the
strike,
employment
was
still
decreasing.
in
spite
of
the
fact,
and
the
ninth
circuit
specifically
cited
the
record
on
this
account
that
the
--
a
record
shows
that
all
strike
associated
disabilities
were
cured
or
were
curable
within
30
days,
the
training
of
employees
and
getting
supplies
and
so
on.
now
this
proves
that
what
we
had
here
was
an
abolishment
due
to
an
economic
state
of
affairs.
essentially,
it
was
nothing
but
a
layoff
which
happened
to
coincide
with
a
strike.
and
second
of
all,
we
would
point
out
that
to
the
extent
that
there
was
a
decrease
of
employment,
these
new
job
openings
that
occurred
in
october
were
really
nothing
but
filling
the
place
of
permanent
replacements.
and
it's
well
established
that
there
is
no
right
to
preference
on
the
part
of
strikers
with
it
then
replaced
to
--
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
that's
right,
the
labor
board
--
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
the
labor
board
did
not
deal
with
it.
the
court
of
appeals
did
deal
with
it
and
has
treated
it
in
this
way
that
to
that
extent
they
were
--
did
constitute
nothing
but
a
replacement
of
replacements.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
well
--
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
five
months
is
a
long
time
your
honor
in
the
industrial
market.
this
strike
occurred
in
august,
this
prestrike
production
or
this
is
what
you
might
call
a
prestrike
production
level
and
there's
really
no
magic
in
saying
that
there
was
a
110
employees
and
20
units
before
the
strike.
but
even
so,
this
level
was
not
achieved
until
five
months
after
the
end
of
the
strike
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
this
represented
a
calculated
regrouping
of
the
--
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
that's
right
your
honor.
and
if
--
but
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
and
this
appears
at
page
100
of
the
record,
that
these
four
lines
which
were
reported
by
the
--
by
mr.
come,
really
were
addressed
to
nothing
more
than
big
intentions
as
to
future
plans.
the
specific
test
to
the
specific
course
of
events
however
was
that
the
production
had
remained
--
it
was
actually
slightly
less
than
their
capacity
at
the
end
of
the
strike
two
months
later.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
oh,
yes
sir.
we
stipulated
that
--
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
that
is
right
your
honor
--
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
that
stipulation
appears
in
the
record
in
this
brief.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
i
feel
that
--
that
was
their
finding
of
the
fact.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
that's
right
sir.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
yes
sir.
and
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
supported
universal
camera
and
in
this
court
there
is
no
contention
by
the
petitioner
that
the
ninth
circuit
misapplied
universal
camera.
now,
under
--
question
of
the
board
president,
the
petitioner's
brief
and
mr.
come
here
today
could
only
distinguish
them
on
the
grounds
and
i'm
quoting
from
his
brief
now,
“the
strikers'
jobs
had
in
effect
been
abolished”.
now
that
is
precisely
the
very
question
which
the
board
itself
said
it
was
determining,
which
the
ninth
circuit
said
it
was
determining
so
that
they
cannot
constitute
a
valid
distinction
of
those
cases.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
now,
although
not
addressed
to
an
oral
argument
here,
the
petitioner
suggest
that
a
different
result
might
be
compelled
in
this
case
because
of
this
court's
recent
decision
in
the
great
dane
case
which
holds
that
given
the
discriminatory
act
by
an
employer,
that
an
intent
to
discourage
membership
in
a
union
organization
in
its
broad
sense
can
be
inferred
in
the
burden
of
proof
shifts
to
the
employer
to
justify
his
action.
now,
we
submit
that
great
dane
is
not
applicable
to
this
case
for
these
three
reasons.
first
of
all,
as
mr.
come
said
this
morning,
the
labor
board
concedes
that
no
preference
is
required
for
strikers
whose
jobs
had
been
abolished,
now
i
submit
that
it
couldn't
have
been
the
intent
of
great
dane
to
require
an
employer
to
justify
an
action
which
the
labor
board
concedes
as
a
matter
of
law
it
had
a
right
to
do.
secondly,
and
probably
recognizing
the
foregoing,
the
law
of
the
labor
board
in
it's
own
brief
here
only
applies
great
dane
to
unreplaced
economic
strikers.
that
appears
in
their
brief
at
page
10.
now,
as
i
indicated,
we
stipulated
at
the
hearing
orally
to
--
on
the
record
and
we
have
contended
ever
since
that
if
the
strikers'
positions
had
not
been
permanently
abolished,
they
were
entitled
to
preference.
but
if
they
had
been
permanently
abolished,
they
were
not
entitled
to
preference.
but
again,
this
turns
on
that
fact
issue.
there
is
even
however
--
i
think
a
more
fundamental
reason
why
great
dane
is
not
applicable
to
this
case.
and
i
think
--
and
it
goes
to
the
whole
heart
of
the
government's
action.
in
great
dane,
the
--
an
employer
on
july
12th
suddenly
announced
that
back
as
of
july
1,
vacation
eligibility
would
be
determined.
the
result
was
that
the
strikers
were
not
eligible
for
vacation,
nonstrikers
were.
at
least
in
the
opinion
of
the
majority,
this
was
a
clear
case
of
discrimination
and
the
court
to
hold
it
to
both
of
its
opinion
to
the
issue
of
intent
and
burden
of
proof
in
that
regard.
now,
the
court
pointed
out
in
great
dane
an
8
(a)
(3)
violation
consisted
two
elements,
ithas
to
have
the
discriminatory
act
and
there
has
to
have
the
intent
to
discourage
union
activity.
here,
we
do
not
have
the
first
element
of
the
8
(a)
violation,
a
discrimination.
as
the
record
shows
the
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
so
found,
what
we
had
here
was
really
a
permanent
cutback
of
operations
and
these
strikers
were
unemployed
as
a
result
of
a
permanent
cutback.
and
this
doesn't
constitute
a
discrimination,
and
again,
i
--
i
think
the
best
statement
of
why
it
doesn't
constitute
a
discrimination
appears
in
the
petitioner's
brief
where
they
say
and
i'm
quoting,
this
is
at
page
15,
“where
there's
always
a
risk
that
changes
in
economic
conditions
or
inefficiency
of
production
may
prompt
the
elimination
of
the
jobs
that
some
employees
hold.
and
still
another
argument,
what
seems
to
me
to
be
basically
inconsistent
incidentally
with
the
board's
acceptance
of
the
general
principle
of
permanent
abolishment
constitutes
replacement,
the
petitioner
here
suggests
that
we
should
be
compelled
to
establish
a
preferential
hire
list
because
the
employer
might
use
an
economic
cutback
as
a
deliberate
subterfuge
to
pun
--
to
continue
to
punish
strikers
after
the
strike
is
over.
now,
this
i
submit
is
just
another
way
of
raising
a
fact
issue.
it
goes
to
the
question
whether
there
was
in
fact
abolishment
or
whether
there
is
a
deliberate
withholding
of
the
position
from
the
employees.
i'd
like
to
point
out
here,
that
the
hearing
examiner
found,
the
labor
board
adopted
and
the
circuit
court
approved
the
finding
that
the
employer
had
no
conscious
intent
to
discriminate
against
these
employees.
its
discrimination
if
any
was
inadvertent
in
determining
whether
there
had
been
a
permanent
cutback
or
not.
turning
to
the
amicus
brief
and
so
far
as
it
goes
beyond
the
intentions
of
the
labor
board,
is
the
position
of
the
afl-cio
that
notwithstanding
the
entire
body
of
law
that
has
developed
under
the
mackay
radio
case
back
1938,
this
court
sua
sponte
should
establish
a
rule
that
an
employer
must
create
a
preferential
hire
list
or
striking
employees
regardless
of
the
business
conditions
and
so
on
that
exist
after
the
strike.
it
is
very
candid
in
its
brief
and
is
--
and
it
admits
that
the
contrary
rule
had
been
applied
and
i've
quote
without
exception
since
the
mackay
case
was
decided.
now,
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
the
court
should
not
act
on
the
suggestion
of
the
amicus
in
this
brief
or
in
this
case.
i'd
say
first
of
all,
that
this
is
not
the
type
of
case
that
this
court
decides
as
a
matter
of
first
impression.
this
is
a
highly
important
and
highly
--
very
noble
decision
that
should
not
be
made
without
the
--
without
prior
consideration
of
lower
levels.
as
this
court
said
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
which
i
quoted
in
my
brief,
followed
the
board's
decision
is
not
the
last
word,
it
must
assuredly
be
the
first.
second,
i
believe
the
contention
of
the
amicus
is
not
sound
in
law
either
in
the
language
of
the
statute
or
in
its
legislative
history.
first,
looking
specifically
at
the
language
of
the
statute,
section
9
(c)
(3)
deals
with
the
rights
of
strikers
who
have
been
replaced
and
speaks
specifically
in
terms
of
reinstatement.
section
9
(3)
--
(c)
(3)
simply
gives
them
a
very
limited
right,
the
right
to
vote
and
we
submit
that
the
limited
nature
of
this
grant
indicates
that
the
congress
did
not
have
in
mind
to
grant
them
any
additional
right
beyond
this
point.
second,
if
you
look
at
--
or
third
rather,
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
the
1947
and
1949
amendments
to
the
labor
management
relations
act,
there
are
twice
specific
reference
to
the
mackay
radio
case
and
is
significant,
the
language
that
the
spokesman
at
that
time
used
is
the
position
of
the
amicus
that
mackay
holds
nothing
more
than
that
an
employer
may
hire
permanent
replacements,
but
did
not
address
itself
to
the
question
of
what
the
right
of
those
persons
who
have
been
replaced
--
what
their
right
will
be
after
the
strike
is
over.
but
if
--
we're
referring
to
page
22
of
my
brief
where
the
pertinent
legislative
history
is
given,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
senate
report
number
1126
says
this,
“if
such
strike
is
an
economic
one
and
not
caused
by
an
unfair
labor
practice
of
the
employer,
strikers
permanently
replaced
have
no
right
to
reinstatement”.
in
other
words,
congress
at
this
point
had
recognized
the
further
extension
of
the
mackay
doctrine
that
it
not
only
give
the
employer
the
right
to
replace
but
hire
replacements,
but
it
also
terminated
the
rights
of
reinstatement
of
the
replaced
employees.
now,
that's
from
the
senate
--
that
is
from
the
report.
as
all
--
i
had
--
it's
very
significant,
although
it
comes
from
a
critique
of
the
bill,
senator
pepper
used
this
virtually
identical
language.
finally,
there
is
a
practical
reason
why
the
court
should
not
change
this
rule
at
this
stage
of
the
game.
this
has
been
the
virtually
universal
--
or
the
universal
rule
for
almost
30
years
and
employers
all
over
the
united
states
have
acted
in
reliance
on
these
rules
concerning
reinstatement.
now,
if
this
court
were
to
change
that
rule
today
and
apply
it
to
my
client,
essentially
on
a
retroactive
basis,
the
result
would
be
that
subject
only
to
the
statute
of
limitations,
every
employer
in
this
comp
--
in
this
country,
who
hired
as
of
--
which
might
call
off
the
seniority
list,
in
other
words
a
new
employee
would
be
subject
to
an
unfair
labor
practice
finding
and
the
substantial
back
pay
liability.
i've
cited
in
the
--
in
my
brief,
the
cases
in
this
court
which
point
out
that
when
there
has
been
a
long
reliance,
unchallenged
on
an
administrative
interpretation
of
an
act
that
this
court
will
not
likely
reverse
it.
i
have
nothing
more
unless
the
court
has
some
questions,
i
will
--
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
well,
i
think
your
question
mr.
justice
white
illustrates
the
very
factual
nature
of
this
case.
there's
no
--
there's
going
to
be
some
industries
in
which
you
can
put
people
back
to
work
the
very
next
day
doing
what
they
were
doing,
you've
had
a
repetitive
type
of
work
with
a
ready
market
for
it.
a
department
store
where
the
employees
can
walk
back
in
the
door
and
walk
behind
their
counters
and
ready
to
go
back
to
work.
it
may
have
a
contrary
situation
of
the
--
whether
the
maker
of
a
locomotive
factory
or
some
capital
goods
factory
in
which
heavily
dependent
on
orders
in
order
to
be
--
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
no
sir.
no,
we
had
never
made
that
contention
and
that
is
words
that
--
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
i
would
say
the
jobs
should
be
considered
available
are
those
which
--
once
the
employer
or
those
which
will
be
created
as
the
employer
recovers
from
the
effect
of
the
strike.
but
once
the
effect
of
the
strike
has
been
obviated
and
the
employer
then
continued,
then
he's
simply
is
in
the
position
of
--
as
if
there
had
been
a
layoff
for
instance.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
the
strike
did,
but
also
from
the
record,
apparently,
there
must
have
been
a
shift
in
the
market
because
as
i
say,
the
records
shows
and
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
the
effects
of
the
strike
were
overcome
in
30
days,
yet
the
employer
contend
--
continued
to
operate
at
that
reduced
level.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
that's
definitely
in
--
there's
--
the
record
would
indicate
that,
yes
sir.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
well,
the
court
of
appeals
quoted
some
language
from
the
brown
&
root
case
which
would
appear
to
establish
a
highly
arbitrary
cutoff.
it
says
that
essentially,
that
is
to
be
determined
as
of
the
day
that
the
strike
has
ended.
i
think
what
you
--
the
problem
there
is
a
little
bit
of
a
conceptual
one.
ordinarily,
the
question
whether
a
man
had
been
replaced
in
a
situation
of
abolishment
isn't
going
to
come
up
the
day
the
strike
ends.
it's
going
to
come
up
later
on
down
the
line
when
there
is
a
new
opening,
just
as
it
did
in
this
case.
that's
what
this
whole
case
is
about
when
you
get
on
down
the
line.
nevertheless,
the
status
of
the
employee
is
actually
determined
as
to
the
end
of
that
strike
--
but
you,
but
the
question
comes
up
and
the
evidence
to
which
the
court
looks
would
be
both
the
evidence
which
exist
on
the
day
that
the
strike
ends
and
also
subsequent
evidence.
and
the
opinions
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
a
good
illustration
of
this.
they
--
while
they
made
that
is
determined
as
of
august
20th,
they
didn't
went
on
to
point
out
to
see,
if
you
look
at
this,
the
employer
had
a
capacity
to
produce
15
units
at
the
end
of
the
strike,
two
months
later
it's
only
producing
14.
he
had
said
--
by
the
end
of
the
strike
he
had
71
employees.
two
months
later,
he
had
only
68.
in
other
words,
that
--
the
statement
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
to
be
taken
literally.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
no
sir.
mr.
hugh
j.
scallon
well,
i
think
sir
that
the
--
i
would
say
this,
that
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
clearly
shows
that
it
did
not
make
it
that
--
that
they
can't
make
it
under
that
determination
because
if
so,
all
this
information
about
what
happened
two
months
later
would
be
totally
irrelevant.
yet,
the
court
set
it
out
in
detail.
i
would
say
in
defense
of
the
ninth
circuit,
that
it
quoted
this
language
verbatim
from
the
decision
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
thank
you.
