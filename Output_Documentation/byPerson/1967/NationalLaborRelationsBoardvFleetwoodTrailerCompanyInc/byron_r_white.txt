oh,
are
you
--
are
you
suggesting
that
this
was
a
thought
(inauidble)
the
aftermath
of
most
strikes
at
least
its
production
doesn't
start
automatically
as

take
--
that
they
ask
the

and
that
the
--
for
that
reason,
there
has
been
no
room
for
the
strikers
for
the
turn
of
the

takings
(inaudible)
and
they
were
entitled
to
have
those

is
that
the
kind
of
situation
(inaudible)?
justice

(inaudible)
justice

but
does
it
--
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
what
was
the
page
(inaudible)
for
your
second
quotation.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
the
fact
that
there
were
71
jobs
that
the
--
when
the
strike
was
settled
and
only
68
when
these
people
applied
for
reinstatement?
justice
byron

white
so
three
replacements
--
there
had
been
--
three
openings
had
been
created
out
of
the
71
jobs
that
were
in
existence
at
the
end
of
the
strike.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
did
the
labor
board
or
the
deal
with
--
what
you
--
what
that
would
mean
is
a
difference
between
three
of
these
people
and
three
others?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
deal
with
that
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
do
you
do
with
the
fact
that
five
months
later,
you
were
back
to
prestrike
levels,
just
like
you
at
all
--
like
you're
plan
--
said
the
--
that
he
is
intended
to
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
as
soon
as
possible.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
there's
evidence,
is
that
--
there's
evidence
that
the
--
that
your
client
intended
to
get
back
to
prestrike
level
as
soon
as
possible.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
would
you
do
if
the
period
here
is
getting
back
to
a
full
production
for
30
days
if
i
joined
this
--
and
had
then
a
refusal
to
be
reinstate
sometime
during
the
30-day
period
on
the
ground
that
we
(inaudible)
with
those
employees
but
and
they
hired
somebody
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
then
that
the
--
that
all
jobs
other
than
those
which
are
in
existence
at
the
day
--
on
the
day
the
strike
ends,
have
been
abolished?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
other
jobs
are
available
at
the
end
of
the
strike,
other
than
those
jobs
that
--
in
which
people
have
been
working?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
--
here's
a
strike
one
day
and
--
the
strike
is
over
on
one
day.
and
five
months
later,
the
employer
in
fact
to
where
he
was
before
that
strike.
well,
whatever
got
him
below
a
prestrike
level
strike
did,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
that
even
if
there
hasn't
been
a
strike,
the
employer
couldn't
--
could've
fallen
off
to
the
strike.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
when
they
hired
the
--
they
were
pretty
short
with
what
they
had
when
the
strikers
--
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
have
to
deal
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you'll
have
to
admit,
it
is
--
you
have
to
say
that
none
of
the
strikers
could
have
gotten
the
company
to
replace
any
of
the
71
people
that
they
had
on
the
payroll
in
the
strike
whether
they
were
replacements
or
whether
they
were
returning
--
strikers
who
had
returned.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
raised,
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
the
company
does
the
way
of
either
three
people
lie
--
die
or
leave
or
something,
three
of
those
71
jobs,
there
are
some
strikers
have
first
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
you'd
put
all
the
three
jobs
as
a
106th,
seventh
and
eighth
job,
they
still
considered
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron

oh,
are
you
