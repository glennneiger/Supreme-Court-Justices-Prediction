well,
whatever

(inaudible)
we
submit
that
the
affidavit
you
did
then
established
ample
probable
cause
and
they're
certainly
sufficient
under
this
court's
decision
in
ventresca.
i
think
petitioner's
argument
that
this
was
merely
an
evidentiary
search
warrant
is
somewhat
undercut
by
his
own
concession
here
that
a
number
of
the
items
that
were
seized
were
clearly
means
instrumentalities
to
the
crime.
once
this
warrant
called
for
an
authorized
to
search
and
seizure
for
gambling
instruments
and
gambling
paraphernalia.
the
terminology
used
in
this
warrant
had
been
sustained
uniformly
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
we
submit
that
a
review
of
what
was
actually
seized
in
this
case
shows
that
what
the
agents
were
seizing
was
the
means
of
instrumentalities
by
which
this
petitioner
carry
on
his
illegal
gambling
activity.
and
to
the
extent
that
there
might
have
been
one
or
two
items
seized
that
may
or
may
not
come
within
this
framework
of
a
means
and
instrumentality
of
the
crime.
certainly
the
fact
that
those
who
anted
to
those
that
might
have
been
seized
in
no
way
invalidates
the
legitimate
search
and
seizure
took
place
in

of
all
these
facts
we
submit
the
