could
you
state
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn't
that
be
true
if
that's
all
in
berger,
the
court
held
that
all
telephonic
eavesdropping
violates
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
but
i
thought
what
they
were
after
there
was
the
right
of
privacy,
the
right
of
men
not
to
be
eavesdropped.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
in
that
instance
over
the
telephone.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

all
that
the
past
cases
like
olmstead
and
all
these
others
you
have
been
discussing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
have
indicated
that
that
was
a
continuing
device.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
where
there
are
cases
decided
because
there
is
some
evidence
around
but
as
i
understand
what
the
courts
held
and
what
it's
holding
under
the
fourth
amendment,
the
fourth
amendment
gives
the
man
a
right
to
complete
privacy
which
is
his
privacy
from
having
his
telephone
calls
overheard.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
wasn't
a
general
warrant,
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
is
there
room
for
anything
left
to
be
reasonable,
which
is
invading
a
man's
privacy?
he
has
this
something
that
he
doesn't
want
to
be
heard
by
the
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

the
fourth
amendment
has
lately
been
construed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
couldn't
agree
that
that's
the
nature
of
the
fourth
amendment,
but
i
could
agree
that
that's
the
nature
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
recently
construed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
it's
an
invasion
of
privacy
to
overhear
people's
conversation
as
it's
undoubtedly
here,
why
is
there
any
room
to
determine
that
that's
a
reasonable
invasion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
what
purpose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
reasonable
for
what
purpose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
for
what
purpose?
what
are
your
viewing
and
thought
that
it
determined
a
reasonable
as
to
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
snooping
as
it's
called,
is
that
a
violation
to
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
indicate
which
one
it
wouldn't
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
what
grounds
would
you
draw
to
say
it's
reasonable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
any
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
reasonable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
go
and
overhear
a
man's
conversation
when
you're
talking
about
crime
or
something
and
when
he
doesn't
wanted
to
be
heard,
what
grounds
would
you
say
would
make
it
reasonable
to
sue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
that
we're
taking
the
position
that
this
man's
telephone
booth
is
not
katz's.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
proper
control?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
construed
it
and
as
authorizing
telephonic
eavesdropping
if
there's
a
statement
made
to
the
officer
just
showing
you
and
what
they
want
to
do
as
to
tell
that's
eavesdrop
this
man
over
the
telephone
in
order
to
see
if
he's
been
guilty
of
a
crime
if
they
do
it
in
the
narrow
manner.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
then
it
wouldn't
bar
telephonic
eavesdropping.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
mean
to
divide
it
up
into
different
crime.
you
don't
mean
that
at
the
court's
reasonableness
too.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
can
say
you
can
eavesdrop
if
it
relates
to
national
security.
you
just
can't
do
it
if
it
relates
to
robbery
and
burglary
and
rape.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
would
have
invalid
under
the
berger
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
otherwise,
they
didn't
have
the
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
the
constitution
to
come
in
and
get
a
search
warrant
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
that
they
knew
he
was
followed
and
have
probably
cause
to
believe
he
had
been
guilty
of
using
those
wires
to
violate
the
law
in
reference
to
gambling.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
that's
what
justify
search
warrant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
could
not
been
out
on
any
ground?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
would
be
all
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
come
there
are
very
few
people
that
intend
to
commit
a
crime
who
expect
to
be
seen?
justice
hugo
l.

with
our
without

evidence?
justice

with
or
without

evidence?
justice
hugo

yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
they
usually
involved?
justice

to
what?
justice

why
do
you
write
them
there?
justice

he's
