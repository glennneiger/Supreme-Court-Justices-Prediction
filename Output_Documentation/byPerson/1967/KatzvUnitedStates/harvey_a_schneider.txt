mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
of
this
case
that
is
now
before
the
court
are
really
quite
simple.
the
law
applicable
is
something
else
again.
but
the
facts
are
as
follows.
mr.
katz
was
surveilled
by
agents
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
for
a
period
of
approximately
six
days.
during
that
period
of
time,
the
surveillance
was
conducted
by
the
use
of
a
microphone
being
taped
on
top
of
a
public
telephone
booth
or
a
bank
booth,
so
it
was
actually
three
booths.
one
booth
had
been
placed
out
of
order
by
the
telephone
company
and
with
the
telephone
company's
cooperation,
the
other
two
booths
were
used
by
mr.
katz.
sometimes
he
used
one
booth,
sometimes
he
used
another.
the
tape
was
placed
on
top
of
the
booth
or
the
microphone
was
placed
on
top
by
a
tape.
the
fbi
agents
had
undoubtedly
read
their
homework
and
had
not
physically
penetrated
into
the
area
of
the
telephone
booth.
subsequently
after
about
six
days
of
surveillance,
mr.
katz
was
arrested.
he
was
then
taken
to
his
apartment
building
where
his
room
was
searched
under
a
search
warrant
and
numerous
items
were
seized
from
mr.
katz's
apartment.
the
issues
before
the
court
are
fairly
clear.
one,
whether
or
not,
the
search
and
seizure
or
one
of
the
interceptions
of
the
telephone
communications
was
prescribed
by
the
fourth
amendment;
and
two,
whether
or
not,
the
warrant
that
was
used
to
search
his
apartment
building
is
constitutionally
proper
or
constitutionally
defective.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
yes,
your
honor,
to
a
large
extent
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
sir
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
that's
a
good
question,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure.
it's
certainly
the
lower
court
in
making
the
district
court
in
making
its
determination
said
that
it
did
not
think
it
was
a
bugging
device.
it's
certainly
not
a
wiretap
because
i
understand
that
historically
a
wiretap
includes
tapping
into
a
line.
they
certainly
didn't
do
these.
i
--
we
consider
it
generally
a
bugging
but
whether
to
not,
it's
technically
a
bugging
or
a
common
sense.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
i
don't
know.
i
think
it
is
a
bugging
to
me.
in
some,
it's
an
interception.
that's
what
it
is,
whether
to
not
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
that's
correct.
i
don't
think
what
label
you
put
on
it.
whether
you
put
it
label
on
a
bugging
or
anything
else,
makes
any
difference.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
there
was
a
--
the
fbi
agent
testified,
your
honor,
that
in
one
instance
a
third
party
came
into
the
booth.
his
conversation
was
recorded.
and
they
said
they
did
not
listen
to
that
conversation,
but
in
fact
it
was
recorded.
it
was
then
refuted
that
they
did
not
listen
but
it
was
recorded.
to
my
knowledge
and
the
record
indicates,
that
was
the
only
instance
in
which
the
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
no,
they
can
only
pick
up
mr.
katz's
into
the
conversation.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
yes
sir.
i
thought
you
meant
whether
it's
a
third
person
under
that
mr.
katz
was
intercepted.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
yes
sir.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
the
way
it
worked
was
that
there
were
approximately
five
agents
who
were
operating
on
the
team.
mr.
katz
would
leave
his
apartment
building
on
a
certain
specified
time.
the
agents
would
see
him
leave.
they
would
radio
to
another
group
of
agents
who
were
waiting
near
the
booth.
this
agent
would
run
over
and
activate
the
microphone
that
was
taped
on
top
of
the
booth.
the
sounds
would
be
reflected
into
the
microphone
and
then
ultimately
to
a
tape
recorder
which
recorded
the
conversation.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
i
assume
it
was
on
the
agent's
car
over
a
nearby
alley.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
yes
sir.
the
affidavit
definitely
was
based
to
a
large
extent
in
our
view
upon
information
obtained
by
use
of
this
interception.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
well,
as
i
understand
the
testimony
of
the
agent,
they
tried
to
activate
it
when
he
was
about
a
block
away
from
the
telephone
booth.
so
whether
what
walking
distance
of
a
block
is,
it
was
activated
all
during
the
time
that
he
was
in
the
booth.
and
then
as
soon
as
they
saw
him
leave,
they
would
deactivate
it.
now,
this
conversations
ranged
anywhere
from
four
to
10
or
12
minutes,
so
it
would
be
activated
in
a
period
of
probably
15
minutes
in
total
kind
of
a
time
that
they
act
prior
to
the
time
they
reach
the
booth
and
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
yes,
the
surveillance
then
act
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
that
is
correct.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
yes
sir,
the
surveillance
began,
i
believe
it
was
february
19.
they
have
the
--
the
interceptions
began
on
february
19.
they
actually
had
him
under
surveillance
and
notice
that
he
used
that
booth
approximately
three
weeks
prior
to
that.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
no
sir,
to
search
the
booth
or
intercept
the
message.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
no
sir.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
i
am
not
clear
to
the
government's
position
on
that
point,
i
think
they
do.
we
contend
that
they
did
not
but
the
government
probably
will
explain
that
in
detail.
in
any
event,
after
the
following
of
certiorari
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
court's
decision
of
berger
versus
of
new
york;
we
think,
is
somewhat
simplified
with
the
problem
that
we
had
presented
here.
there
was
some
question,
i
think,
up
to
that
time.
maybe
there
was
some
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
conversation
was
the
subject
or
the
proper
subject
of
the
fourth
amendment
protections.
and
whether
you
could
--
the
capture
of
such
conversation
was
a
search
in
seizure.
in
berger,
this
court
specifically
so
held
and
perhaps
mr.
justice
douglas'
comment
that
the
olmstead
was
overruled
sub
silentio
is
accurate.
we
believe
it
is.
we
think
that
if
you
begin
with
what
seems
to
be
the
undeniable
premise
that
the
interception
in
the
instant
case
of
a
telephone
communication
is
within
the
fourth
amendment.
that
is
this
subject
of
a
potential
search
and
seizure.
then
this
case
is
very
easy
and
it
sort
of
turns
on
what
the
chief
justice
has
said
about
a
moment
ago
about
the
interceptions
itself.
it
should
be
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
the
interceptions
are
accomplished
without
a
warrant
and
they
cannot
be
justified
as
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
for
the
following
reason.
of
course
this
court
has
said
incurred
that
searches
and
seizures
are
justifiable
in
only
three
instances.
one
involves
consensual
search,
which
of
course
is
not
involve
in
this
case.
the
other
two
instances
is
being
search
with
a
warrant
and
instant
to
lawful
arrest.
as
i
said
no
warrant
in
this
case
and
the
arrest
in
this
case
was
after
all
of
the
electronic
interception
took
place.
so
as
i
understand
the
federal
rule
that
since
the
search
was
--
preceded
the
arrest,
it
could
not
be
justified
as
incidental
to
a
lawful
arrest.
on
that
basis
alone,
on
the
base
of
the
interception,
was
not
without
warrant
--
not
incidental
and
as
we
conclude
in
and
respectfully
submit
that
the
case
is
decidable
in
that
point
alone
and
it
should
be
reversed
on
that
point
alone.
however
--
and
this
is
the
reason
we're
here.
one
possible
way
to
get
around
this
argument
that,
it
was
not
in
illegal
search
and
seizure.
it
evolves
around
the
determination
of
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
a
telephone
booth
is
a
constitutionally
protected
area.
and
of
course,
that's
the
issue
on
which
certiorari
was
granted.
we
think
and
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
whether
or
not,
a
telephone
booth
or
any
area
is
constitutionally
protected,
is
the
wrong
initial
inquiry.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
question
should
be
determined
as
to
whether
or
not,
let's
say
you
have
an
invasion
of
a
constitutionally
protected
area,
that
shouldn't
be
the
initial
inquiry,
but
rather
that
probably
should
be
the
conclusion
that
is
reached
after
the
application
of
a
test
such
as
that
we
propose
are
similar
test.
now,
we
have
proposed
in
our
brief
and
there's
nothing
magical
or
ingenious
about
our
test.
it's
an
objective
test
which
stresses
the
rule
of
reason,
we
think.
the
test
really
asks
or
opposes
the
question,
“would
a
reasonable
person
objectively
looking
at
the
communication
setting,
the
situation
and
location
of
a
communicator
and
communicatee
--
would
he
reasonably
believe
that
that
communication
was
intended
to
be
confidential?”
we
think
that
in
applying
this
test
there
are
several
criteria
that
can
be
used.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
absolutely.
and
i
think
that
hester,
the
hester
case
which
is
cited
on
the
government's
brief,
we
think
that
hester
is
wrong.
we
think
that
if
a
confidential
communication
was
intended
and
all
the
other
aspects
of
confidentiality
are
present,
then
it
makes
no
difference
whether
you're
in
an
open
field
or
in
the
privacy
of
your
own
home.
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
there
are
factors
present
which
would
tend
to
give
the
courts,
the
trial
courts,
and
ultimately
this
court,
some
guidelines
as
to
whether
or
not
objectively
speaking,
the
communication
was
intended
to
be
private.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
i
would
make
the
same
argument
in
what
respect?
i'm
not
sure
if
the
court
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
no,
i
would
not
--
i
may
or
may
not
make
or
deprived
that
conclusion,
depending
upon
the
application
of
the
test
that
i'm
suggesting.
for
example
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
no,
but
if
i
may
respectfully
state
to
the
court
that
there
are
certain
elements
or
certain
items
which
are
to
be
--
i
think
should
be
considered
in
determining
whether
or
not
objectively
speaking.
i
think
if
i
understand
the
importance
of
the
court's
question,
the
court
is,
mr.
justice
white
is
suggesting
a
subjective
test
whether
or
not
the
person
who
is
conducting
the
conversation
intended
his
communication
to
be
private.
and
of
course,
almost
in
every
instance,
the
answer
to
that
question
would
be
in
the
affirmative.
i'm
suggesting
rather
an
objective
test
whether
third
party
looking
at
the
overall
seemed
would
arrive
at
that
conclusion.
i
think
that
such
items
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
sir?
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
in
my
view,
yes.
i
believe
the
following
factors
at
least
should
be
included
in
an
analysis
of
this
problem.
one,
what
is
the
physical
location?
in
other
words,
where
did
the
conversation
take
place?
was
it
in
a
situation
where
numerous
persons
were
present
or
whether
just
a
few
people
present?
i
think
that
bears
on
the
issue.
i
think
the
tone
of
voice
bears
on
the
issue.
i
think
that
you
can
have
a
communication
for
example
in
your
house
which
almost
everyone
would
see
all
things
being
equal
would
be
confidential.
however,
if
you
use
a
loud
enough
voice,
i
think
you
destroy
your
own
confidentiality.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
absolutely.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
well,
i
can
answer
that
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
i
believe
that
the
activity
engaged
in
one
of
the
enforcement
officer
is
another
one
of
the
criteria
to
be
applied
in
using
this
objective
test.
i
feel
also
that
the
answer
to
the
question
depends
on
whether
you
approach
it
from
a
private
citizen
or
as
a
constitutional
lawyer.
as
a
private
citizen,
if
the
court
is
asking
my
question,
i
would
not
be
in
favor
of
any
kind
of
bugging
device.
as
a
constitutional
lawyer,
i
believe
that
within
the
ambit
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
with
the
sufficient
protections
present,
i
think
there
can
be
bugging.
and
i
think
this
court
in
berger
indicate
that
if
there
is
sufficient
protection
present,
that
there
can
be
in
a
given
setting
with
probable
cause
and
specificity
in
terms
of
items
to
be
searched,
in
terms
of
persons
to
be
searched,
i
think
you
might
in
a
constitutional
sense
have
a
situation
where
an
artificial
listening
device
may
be
used.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
that's
correct.
and
again
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
that's
absolutely
correct.
and
again,
i
really
feel
that
the
emphasis
on
whether
or
not
you
have
a
constitutionally
protected
area
may
be
placing
the
emphasis
on
the
wrong
place.
we
feel
that
the
fourth
amendment
and
at
the
court's
decisions
recently
for
a
long
time,
i
believe,
have
indicated
that
the
right
to
privacy
is
what's
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
we
feel
that
the
right
to
privacy
follows
the
individual.
and
that
whether
or
not,
he's
in
a
space
when
closed
by
four
walls,
and
a
ceiling,
and
a
roof,
or
an
auto-mobile,
or
any
other
physical
location,
is
not
determined
of
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
communication
can
ultimately
be
declared
confidential.
we
think
that
the
right
to
privacy
follows
the
individual.
and
if
all
the
other
aspects
of
confidentiality
are
present,
he's
entitled
to
the
confidentiality
of
this
communication
that
i
think
distinguishes
the
hester
case.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
i
think
that
taking
osborn
and
berger
together
for
example
that
these
two
cases
read
together
would
seem
to
indicate
that
if
there
are
very
particular
measures
taken,
various
specific
measures
taken,
so
that
in
the
language
of
the
court
or
in
other
areas
that
the
attached
magistrate
is
imposed
between
the
people
who
are
trying
to
intercept
and
the
communication
they
are
attempting
to
intercept.
if
those
very
specific
qualities
are
present,
then
i
think
those
two
decisions
can
be
read
as
saying
that
you
can
search
and
you
can
use
a
listening
device
if
those
objects
are
present.
that's
how
i
read
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
no
sir.
there's
certainly
no
warrant,
no
attack,
and
the
record
does
not
indicate.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
that
is
correct.
of
course,
as
i
understand
on
those
decisions
that
the
decisions
turned
on
the
aspect
of
voluntariness
and
that
the
person
whose
communication
was
intercepted
actually
invited
them
in
to
talk.
they
weren't
doing
anything
that
is
devious
insofar
as
gaining
access
to
the
place.
it's
true
that
their
communications
were
intercepted
once
they
got
access.
but
i
think
that's
to
be
distinguished
from
the
instant
case
where
the
interception
itself
is
devious,
let
alone
with
the
interception.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
i
was
enumerating
it
in
a
little
detail.
the
elements
that
we
consider
should
be
considered
in
applying
this
objective
test
that
we
proposed.
and
may
have
i
slit
over
on
one
of
those
items
and
i
like
to
just
briefly
restate
that.and
that
is
this.
we
think
that
the
physical
activity
or
physical
position
of
the
officer
or
law
enforcement
officer
has
to
assume
in
order
to
overhear
the
communication
is
a
relevant
aspect
to
be
considered.
now,
it's
before
this
court,
although
it
is
in
the
record
that
one
of
the
fbi
agents
in
this
case
observes
or
listens
to
telephone
communications
--
excuse
me
–
listen
to
communications
from
mr.
katz
while
occupying
a
hotel
room
or
an
apartment
room
next
to
mr.
katz's.
the
way
he
did
this
apparently
was,
he
took
of
the
electrical
apparatus
although,
i
assumed
it
was
the
wall
plug
where
the
sockets
go.
took
that
off
of
his
side
of
his
room
and
put
his
ear
and
probably
used
a
drinking
glass
to
magnify
the
sound.
now,
we
think
that
those
are
the
kind
of
things
that
show
that
the
officer
is
going
on
a
great
length
in
order
to
obtain
the
communication.
with
regard
to
that
element
alone,
it
would
seem
that
if
the
other
elements
are
present,
then
an
unconstitutional
search
has
arisen.
i
think
it's
fairly
clear
if
the
court
please
that
under
the
test
that
we
proposed
or
any
similar
objective
test,
that
the
physical
trespass
test
which
seems
to
be
the
rule
enunciated
in
goldman
can
no
longer
stand.
and
we
would
request
respectfully
that
goldman
be
overruled.
and
we
see
no
way
to
get
around
overruling
goldman
if
in
fact
this
new
test
or
anything
similar
to
it
is
going
to
be
applied.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
well,
we
respectfully
submit
that
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
i
think
it
has
been,
yes
sir.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
well,
maybe
not
too
strong,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.as
i
understand
what
olmstead
said,
it
said
that
an
interception
of
the
kind
that
occurred
in
that
case
is
not
a
search
and
is
not
a
seizure.
specifically
in
berger,
this
court
held
that
the
capture
of
a
telephone
conversation
or
a
conversation
isn't
in
the
fourth
amendment,
and
that
it
is
a
seizure.
i
don't
think
that
they
can
be
reconciled,
those
two
propositions.
either
goldman
over
--
strike
to
either
this
court
in
berger
overruled
olmstead.
i
don't
think
it
has
to
be
said
that
it
overruled
it
really
very
strongly
subsequently.
i
think
it
overruled
him.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
that's
case,
yes
sir.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
no
i
don't
--
not
necessarily.
i
think
that
we
couldn't
win
here
by
showing
under
the
court
rule
for
example
there
was
a
warrantless
search
not
founded
upon
probable
cause,
and
not
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
i
think
on
that
basis
alone,
we
would
be
entitled
to
reverse.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
that
assumes
i
suppose
that
you
have
to
make
the
initial
inquiry
that
there
has
been
or
that
there
is
a
constitutionally
protected
area.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
no
question
about
it.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
no
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
i
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
well,
of
course
it
depends
on
how
you
define
trespass.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
well,
certainly
there
was
penetration
of
sound
waves
that
went
from
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
so
that's
the
trespass
is
about
(voice
overlap).
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
well
no
i
think
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
that's
correct.
yes,
i
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
i
think
that's
probably
a
fair
statement.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
yes
sir.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
i'm
sorry
i
did
not
hear
that.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
whether
or
not,
there
is
still
vitality
in
those
decisions.
i
think
it's
clear
that
they
have
not
been
expressly
overruled.
as
far
as
the
trespassory,
we
submit
that
they
should
be
based
on
the
court's
current
trend
of
protecting
privacy
and
getting
away
from
political
trespassers.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
as
far
as
i'm
aware,
that's
true.
i
mentioned
briefly
this
morning
in
passing
that
along
with
the
same
notion
at
least
to
for
a
test
or
anything
similar
as
this,
the
hester
case
also
has
to
go
as
well,
at
least
that
dictum.
i
think
it's
dictum
(voice
overlap)
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
yes
sir.
that
was
--
mr.
justice
holmes
wrote
the
opinion
in
that
case,
the
short
case
actually,
two
agents
had
seen
--
came
on
to
the
defendant's
property,
hid
behind
the
bush
or
something.
from
50
or
100
yards
away,
they
observed
the
defendant
exchanging
with
the
third
person
what
i
believe
was
the
illegal
or
illicit
alcoholic
beverages
or
some
kind.
the
court
had
the
search
and
seizure
issue
before
but
held
that
really
it
didn't
reach
the
search
and
seizure
issue
because
it's
said
in
effect
that
it
was
seeing
the
officers
--
the
agents
were
seeing
a
play
enacted
before
their
eyes
and
didn't
have
to
do
anything
over
in
order
to
intercept.
at
the
very
end
of
the
appendix
to
the
last
or
next
to
the
last
sentence
mr.
justice
holmes
states
in
any
of
event,
an
open
field
is
not
entitled
the
fourth
amendment
protection.
i
think
that
the
statement
was
not
necessary
for
the
decision
in
the
case.
may
i
also
would
submit
that
to
the
extent
that
any
test
similar
that
which
we
propose
is
accepted
by
the
court,
a
test
you
can
not
stand.
i've
also
indicated
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
sir?
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
yes,
we
propose
a
test
using
in
a
way
it's
not
too
dissimilar
from
a
tort,
that
tort
reasonable
man
test.
we're
suggesting
that
what
should
be
used
is
the
communication
setting
should
be
observed
and
those
items
that
should
be
considered
are
the
tone
of
voice,
the
actual
physical
location
where
the
conversation
took
place,
the
activities
on
the
part
of
the
officer.
when
all
those
things
are
considered,
we
would
ask
that
the
test
be
applied
as
to
whether
or
not
a
third
person
objectively
looking
at
the
entire
scene
could
reasonably
interpret
and
could
reasonably
say
that
the
communicator
intended
his
communication
to
be
confidential.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
then
at
least
applying
the
elements
of
our
case,
he
has
certainly
gone
a
step
toward
waiving
the
privilege.
if
you
can
talk
in
terms
of
waiver,
if
he
--
it
has
door
closed
even
but
talks
in
an
extremely
loud
tone
of
voice
so
that
anybody
passing
by
or
using
an
adjacent
booth
can
overhear,
i
think
he
too
has
gone
through
a
step
toward
shedding
himself
of
the
privilege.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
i
said,
i
didn't
mean
to
put
it
in
terms
of
waiver.
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
that
the
constitutional
protection
would
not
apply
the
way
to
phrase
it.
we
--
i
have
indicated
this
morning
that
we
think
that
the
right
to
privacy
which
is
the
fourth
amendment's
concern,
as
i
understand,
follows
the
individual.
and
we
would
base
our
contention
upon
this
by
reading
or
literal
reading
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
respectfully
call
the
court's
attention
that
the
fourth
amendment
after
paraphrasing
a
little
bit
here,
but
it
says
people
have
a
right
to
be
“secure
in
their
persons.”
that
is
the
very
first
item
of
protection
that
is
contained
in
the
first
amendment.
it
says
persons
of
the
fourth
amendment.
it
says
persons
then
it
says
houses.
and
i
believe
it
says
personal
effects
in
one
other
item.
but
it's
significant
to
know
what
i
think,
that
the
very
first
item
of
protection
in
the
fourth
amendment
is
persons.
and
we
would
contend
that
this
fact
is
a
little
credence
to
our
view,
that
privacy
does
follow
the
individual.
we
have
asked
also,
of
course,
to
brief
the
issue
of
the
warrant
that
was
involved
in
this
case
and
to
argue
on
it.
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
earlier,
i
believe
it
was
he
that
if
there
was
an
illegal
search
and
seizure
of
the
telephone
communications,
i
believe
that
the
warrant
to
the
extent
that
it
is
based
on
the
information
obtained
from
that
search
and
that
seizure
must
fall
because
it
would
not
be
based
upon
probable
cause.
i
don't
think
there's
sufficient
evidence
presented
in
the
warrant
absent
the
interception
of
the
telephone
communication
to
have
enabled
the
agent
to
get
a
warrant,
but
assuming
for
purpose
of
argument
that
there
is
sufficient
evidence
or
sufficient
information
present.
we
would
say
that
the
warrant
authorized
the
search
for
mere
evidence.
now,
we
recognized
that
this
argument
applies
right
in
the
face
of
the
court's
recent
decision
in
hayden.
we
are
unable
frankly
to
reconcile
hayden
with
rule
41
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
we
think
that
rules
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
fruits
and
instrumentalities.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
in
this
respect,
the
court
in
majority
opinion
in
hayden,
your
honor,
stated
that
rule
41
followed
the
gouled
decision
and
incorporated
the
test
of
gouled.
and
also
the
majority
opinion
in
the
case,
that
the
41
is
a
limitation
or
it
consists
of
the
limitation
on
the
enforcement
officers
to
get
a
warrant
under
a
situation
where
mere
evidence
only
or
exclusively
assault
or
in
addition.
we
think
that
the
congress
has
the
right
to
make
a
statue
or
a
rule
as
in
this
case
more
restrictive
than
that
which
is
minimally
required
by
this
court.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
it's
permissible.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
that's
right
but
we
think
that
based
on
gouled
that
rule
41
was
an
attempt
by
the
congress
to
restrict
it.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
that's
right
but
it
hasn't
been
changed
and
as
far
as
i
know
and
unless
there
is
another
legislative
enactment,
i
think
that
41
still
is
the
law.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
numerous
items,
the
return
of
the
warrant
of
course
is
in
the
record.
there
were
such
things
as
newspaper
clippings,
magazines,
and
telephone
books.
there
were
to
be
sure
items
which
would
normally
be
quick,
considered
book
making
paraphernalia
or
handicapping
information
at
least
of
slips
markers
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
well
i
think
the
markers
in
the
slips
surely
are.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
the
telephone
book?
i
don't
have
(voice
overlap).
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
that
may
well
be.
that
certainly
the
items
that
he
was
using
in
order
to
engage
to
what
ever
activity
he
engaged
in.
i
find
it
difficult
to
concede
that
newspaper
clippings
or
copies
of
sport
magazine
and
that
sort
of
thing
are
fruits
or
instrumentalities.
i
find
it
very
difficult.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
well,
i
think
--
i
frankly
am
unable
to
understand
what
fruits
and
instrumentalities
really
mean.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
right.
so
i
must
candidly
admit
that.
however,
it
seems
to
me,
if
you
extend
this
proposition
too
far,
i
suppose
and
i
don't
mean
to
make
light
of
the
situation,
but
if
he
dials
the
telephone
with
his
index
finger,
then
the
government's
entitled
to
an
amputation.
i
don't
think
that's
the
law.
i
think
that
you
can
--
there's
no
end
to
where
you
can
go
on
this
fruits
and
instrumentalities.
unless
there
is
anymore
question,
we
have
a
divided
argument
on
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
--
and
rebuttal
after
the
government
has
presented
its
case.
if
there
are
no
other
questions
i
would
refer
to
mr.
martin
at
this
time.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
of
this
case
that
is
now
before
the
court
are
really
quite
simple.
the
law
applicable
is
something
else
again.
but
the
facts
are
as
follows.
mr.
katz
was
surveilled
by
agents
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
for
a
period
of
approximately
six
days.
during
that
period
of
time,
the
surveillance
was
conducted
by
the
use
of
a
microphone
being
taped
on
top
of
a
public
telephone
booth
or
a
bank
booth,
so
it
was
actually
three
booths.
one
booth
had
been
placed
out
of
order
by
the
telephone
company
and
with
the
telephone
company's
cooperation,
the
other
two
booths
were
used
by
mr.
katz.
sometimes
he
used
one
booth,
sometimes
he
used
another.
the
tape
was
placed
on
top
of
the
booth
or
the
microphone
was
placed
on
top
by
a
tape.
the
fbi
agents
had
undoubtedly
read
their
homework
and
had
not
physically
penetrated
into
the
area
of
the
telephone
booth.
subsequently
after
about
six
days
of
surveillance,
mr.
katz
was
arrested.
he
was
then
taken
to
his
apartment
building
where
his
room
was
searched
under
a
search
warrant
and
numerous
items
were
seized
from
mr.
katz's
apartment.
the
issues
before
the
court
are
fairly
clear.
one,
whether
or
not,
the
search
and
seizure
or
one
of
the
interceptions
of
the
telephone
communications
was
prescribed
by
the
fourth
amendment;
and
two,
whether
or
not,
the
warrant
that
was
used
to
search
his
apartment
building
is
constitutionally
proper
or
constitutionally
defective.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
yes,
your
honor,
to
a
large
extent
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
sir
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
that's
a
good
question,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure.
it's
certainly
the
lower
court
in
making
the
district
court
in
making
its
determination
said
that
it
did
not
think
it
was
a
bugging
device.
it's
certainly
not
a
wiretap
because
i
understand
that
historically
a
wiretap
includes
tapping
into
a
line.
they
certainly
didn't
do
these.
i
--
we
consider
it
generally
a
bugging
but
whether
to
not,
it's
technically
a
bugging
or
a
common
sense.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
i
don't
know.
i
think
it
is
a
bugging
to
me.
in
some,
it's
an
interception.
that's
what
it
is,
whether
to
not
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
that's
correct.
i
don't
think
what
label
you
put
on
it.
whether
you
put
it
label
on
a
bugging
or
anything
else,
makes
any
difference.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
there
was
a
--
the
fbi
agent
testified,
your
honor,
that
in
one
instance
a
third
party
came
into
the
booth.
his
conversation
was
recorded.
and
they
said
they
did
not
listen
to
that
conversation,
but
in
fact
it
was
recorded.
it
was
then
refuted
that
they
did
not
listen
but
it
was
recorded.
to
my
knowledge
and
the
record
indicates,
that
was
the
only
instance
in
which
the
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
no,
they
can
only
pick
up
mr.
katz's
into
the
conversation.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
yes
sir.
i
thought
you
meant
whether
it's
a
third
person
under
that
mr.
katz
was
intercepted.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
yes
sir.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
the
way
it
worked
was
that
there
were
approximately
five
agents
who
were
operating
on
the
team.
mr.
katz
would
leave
his
apartment
building
on
a
certain
specified
time.
the
agents
would
see
him
leave.
they
would
radio
to
another
group
of
agents
who
were
waiting
near
the
booth.
this
agent
would
run
over
and
activate
the
microphone
that
was
taped
on
top
of
the
booth.
the
sounds
would
be
reflected
into
the
microphone
and
then
ultimately
to
a
tape
recorder
which
recorded
the
conversation.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
i
assume
it
was
on
the
agent's
car
over
a
nearby
alley.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
yes
sir.
the
affidavit
definitely
was
based
to
a
large
extent
in
our
view
upon
information
obtained
by
use
of
this
interception.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
well,
as
i
understand
the
testimony
of
the
agent,
they
tried
to
activate
it
when
he
was
about
a
block
away
from
the
telephone
booth.
so
whether
what
walking
distance
of
a
block
is,
it
was
activated
all
during
the
time
that
he
was
in
the
booth.
and
then
as
soon
as
they
saw
him
leave,
they
would
deactivate
it.
now,
this
conversations
ranged
anywhere
from
four
to
10
or
12
minutes,
so
it
would
be
activated
in
a
period
of
probably
15
minutes
in
total
kind
of
a
time
that
they
act
prior
to
the
time
they
reach
the
booth
and
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
yes,
the
surveillance
then
act
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
that
is
correct.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
yes
sir,
the
surveillance
began,
i
believe
it
was
february
19.
they
have
the
--
the
interceptions
began
on
february
19.
they
actually
had
him
under
surveillance
and
notice
that
he
used
that
booth
approximately
three
weeks
prior
to
that.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
no
sir,
to
search
the
booth
or
intercept
the
message.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
no
sir.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
i
am
not
clear
to
the
government's
position
on
that
point,
i
think
they
do.
we
contend
that
they
did
not
but
the
government
probably
will
explain
that
in
detail.
in
any
event,
after
the
following
of
certiorari
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
court's
decision
of
berger
versus
of
new
york;
we
think,
is
somewhat
simplified
with
the
problem
that
we
had
presented
here.
there
was
some
question,
i
think,
up
to
that
time.
maybe
there
was
some
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
conversation
was
the
subject
or
the
proper
subject
of
the
fourth
amendment
protections.
and
whether
you
could
--
the
capture
of
such
conversation
was
a
search
in
seizure.
in
berger,
this
court
specifically
so
held
and
perhaps
mr.
justice
douglas'
comment
that
the
olmstead
was
overruled
sub
silentio
is
accurate.
we
believe
it
is.
we
think
that
if
you
begin
with
what
seems
to
be
the
undeniable
premise
that
the
interception
in
the
instant
case
of
a
telephone
communication
is
within
the
fourth
amendment.
that
is
this
subject
of
a
potential
search
and
seizure.
then
this
case
is
very
easy
and
it
sort
of
turns
on
what
the
chief
justice
has
said
about
a
moment
ago
about
the
interceptions
itself.
it
should
be
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
the
interceptions
are
accomplished
without
a
warrant
and
they
cannot
be
justified
as
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
for
the
following
reason.
of
course
this
court
has
said
incurred
that
searches
and
seizures
are
justifiable
in
only
three
instances.
one
involves
consensual
search,
which
of
course
is
not
involve
in
this
case.
the
other
two
instances
is
being
search
with
a
warrant
and
instant
to
lawful
arrest.
as
i
said
no
warrant
in
this
case
and
the
arrest
in
this
case
was
after
all
of
the
electronic
interception
took
place.
so
as
i
understand
the
federal
rule
that
since
the
search
was
--
preceded
the
arrest,
it
could
not
be
justified
as
incidental
to
a
lawful
arrest.
on
that
basis
alone,
on
the
base
of
the
interception,
was
not
without
warrant
--
not
incidental
and
as
we
conclude
in
and
respectfully
submit
that
the
case
is
decidable
in
that
point
alone
and
it
should
be
reversed
on
that
point
alone.
however
--
and
this
is
the
reason
we're
here.
one
possible
way
to
get
around
this
argument
that,
it
was
not
in
illegal
search
and
seizure.
it
evolves
around
the
determination
of
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
a
telephone
booth
is
a
constitutionally
protected
area.
and
of
course,
that's
the
issue
on
which
certiorari
was
granted.
we
think
and
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
whether
or
not,
a
telephone
booth
or
any
area
is
constitutionally
protected,
is
the
wrong
initial
inquiry.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
question
should
be
determined
as
to
whether
or
not,
let's
say
you
have
an
invasion
of
a
constitutionally
protected
area,
that
shouldn't
be
the
initial
inquiry,
but
rather
that
probably
should
be
the
conclusion
that
is
reached
after
the
application
of
a
test
such
as
that
we
propose
are
similar
test.
now,
we
have
proposed
in
our
brief
and
there's
nothing
magical
or
ingenious
about
our
test.
it's
an
objective
test
which
stresses
the
rule
of
reason,
we
think.
the
test
really
asks
or
opposes
the
question,
“would
a
reasonable
person
objectively
looking
at
the
communication
setting,
the
situation
and
location
of
a
communicator
and
communicatee
--
would
he
reasonably
believe
that
that
communication
was
intended
to
be
confidential?”
we
think
that
in
applying
this
test
there
are
several
criteria
that
can
be
used.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
absolutely.
and
i
think
that
hester,
the
hester
case
which
is
cited
on
the
government's
brief,
we
think
that
hester
is
wrong.
we
think
that
if
a
confidential
communication
was
intended
and
all
the
other
aspects
of
confidentiality
are
present,
then
it
makes
no
difference
whether
you're
in
an
open
field
or
in
the
privacy
of
your
own
home.
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
there
are
factors
present
which
would
tend
to
give
the
courts,
the
trial
courts,
and
ultimately
this
court,
some
guidelines
as
to
whether
or
not
objectively
speaking,
the
communication
was
intended
to
be
private.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
i
would
make
the
same
argument
in
what
respect?
i'm
not
sure
if
the
court
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
no,
i
would
not
--
i
may
or
may
not
make
or
deprived
that
conclusion,
depending
upon
the
application
of
the
test
that
i'm
suggesting.
for
example
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
no,
but
if
i
may
respectfully
state
to
the
court
that
there
are
certain
elements
or
certain
items
which
are
to
be
--
i
think
should
be
considered
in
determining
whether
or
not
objectively
speaking.
i
think
if
i
understand
the
importance
of
the
court's
question,
the
court
is,
mr.
justice
white
is
suggesting
a
subjective
test
whether
or
not
the
person
who
is
conducting
the
conversation
intended
his
communication
to
be
private.
and
of
course,
almost
in
every
instance,
the
answer
to
that
question
would
be
in
the
affirmative.
i'm
suggesting
rather
an
objective
test
whether
third
party
looking
at
the
overall
seemed
would
arrive
at
that
conclusion.
i
think
that
such
items
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
sir?
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
in
my
view,
yes.
i
believe
the
following
factors
at
least
should
be
included
in
an
analysis
of
this
problem.
one,
what
is
the
physical
location?
in
other
words,
where
did
the
conversation
take
place?
was
it
in
a
situation
where
numerous
persons
were
present
or
whether
just
a
few
people
present?
i
think
that
bears
on
the
issue.
i
think
the
tone
of
voice
bears
on
the
issue.
i
think
that
you
can
have
a
communication
for
example
in
your
house
which
almost
everyone
would
see
all
things
being
equal
would
be
confidential.
however,
if
you
use
a
loud
enough
voice,
i
think
you
destroy
your
own
confidentiality.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
absolutely.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
well,
i
can
answer
that
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
i
believe
that
the
activity
engaged
in
one
of
the
enforcement
officer
is
another
one
of
the
criteria
to
be
applied
in
using
this
objective
test.
i
feel
also
that
the
answer
to
the
question
depends
on
whether
you
approach
it
from
a
private
citizen
or
as
a
constitutional
lawyer.
as
a
private
citizen,
if
the
court
is
asking
my
question,
i
would
not
be
in
favor
of
any
kind
of
bugging
device.
as
a
constitutional
lawyer,
i
believe
that
within
the
ambit
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
with
the
sufficient
protections
present,
i
think
there
can
be
bugging.
and
i
think
this
court
in
berger
indicate
that
if
there
is
sufficient
protection
present,
that
there
can
be
in
a
given
setting
with
probable
cause
and
specificity
in
terms
of
items
to
be
searched,
in
terms
of
persons
to
be
searched,
i
think
you
might
in
a
constitutional
sense
have
a
situation
where
an
artificial
listening
device
may
be
used.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
that's
correct.
and
again
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
that's
absolutely
correct.
and
again,
i
really
feel
that
the
emphasis
on
whether
or
not
you
have
a
constitutionally
protected
area
may
be
placing
the
emphasis
on
the
wrong
place.
we
feel
that
the
fourth
amendment
and
at
the
court's
decisions
recently
for
a
long
time,
i
believe,
have
indicated
that
the
right
to
privacy
is
what's
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
we
feel
that
the
right
to
privacy
follows
the
individual.
and
that
whether
or
not,
he's
in
a
space
when
closed
by
four
walls,
and
a
ceiling,
and
a
roof,
or
an
auto-mobile,
or
any
other
physical
location,
is
not
determined
of
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
communication
can
ultimately
be
declared
confidential.
we
think
that
the
right
to
privacy
follows
the
individual.
and
if
all
the
other
aspects
of
confidentiality
are
present,
he's
entitled
to
the
confidentiality
of
this
communication
that
i
think
distinguishes
the
hester
case.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
i
think
that
taking
osborn
and
berger
together
for
example
that
these
two
cases
read
together
would
seem
to
indicate
that
if
there
are
very
particular
measures
taken,
various
specific
measures
taken,
so
that
in
the
language
of
the
court
or
in
other
areas
that
the
attached
magistrate
is
imposed
between
the
people
who
are
trying
to
intercept
and
the
communication
they
are
attempting
to
intercept.
if
those
very
specific
qualities
are
present,
then
i
think
those
two
decisions
can
be
read
as
saying
that
you
can
search
and
you
can
use
a
listening
device
if
those
objects
are
present.
that's
how
i
read
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
no
sir.
there's
certainly
no
warrant,
no
attack,
and
the
record
does
not
indicate.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
that
is
correct.
of
course,
as
i
understand
on
those
decisions
that
the
decisions
turned
on
the
aspect
of
voluntariness
and
that
the
person
whose
communication
was
intercepted
actually
invited
them
in
to
talk.
they
weren't
doing
anything
that
is
devious
insofar
as
gaining
access
to
the
place.
it's
true
that
their
communications
were
intercepted
once
they
got
access.
but
i
think
that's
to
be
distinguished
from
the
instant
case
where
the
interception
itself
is
devious,
let
alone
with
the
interception.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
i
was
enumerating
it
in
a
little
detail.
the
elements
that
we
consider
should
be
considered
in
applying
this
objective
test
that
we
proposed.
and
may
have
i
slit
over
on
one
of
those
items
and
i
like
to
just
briefly
restate
that.and
that
is
this.
we
think
that
the
physical
activity
or
physical
position
of
the
officer
or
law
enforcement
officer
has
to
assume
in
order
to
overhear
the
communication
is
a
relevant
aspect
to
be
considered.
now,
it's
before
this
court,
although
it
is
in
the
record
that
one
of
the
fbi
agents
in
this
case
observes
or
listens
to
telephone
communications
--
excuse
me
–
listen
to
communications
from
mr.
katz
while
occupying
a
hotel
room
or
an
apartment
room
next
to
mr.
katz's.
the
way
he
did
this
apparently
was,
he
took
of
the
electrical
apparatus
although,
i
assumed
it
was
the
wall
plug
where
the
sockets
go.
took
that
off
of
his
side
of
his
room
and
put
his
ear
and
probably
used
a
drinking
glass
to
magnify
the
sound.
now,
we
think
that
those
are
the
kind
of
things
that
show
that
the
officer
is
going
on
a
great
length
in
order
to
obtain
the
communication.
with
regard
to
that
element
alone,
it
would
seem
that
if
the
other
elements
are
present,
then
an
unconstitutional
search
has
arisen.
i
think
it's
fairly
clear
if
the
court
please
that
under
the
test
that
we
proposed
or
any
similar
objective
test,
that
the
physical
trespass
test
which
seems
to
be
the
rule
enunciated
in
goldman
can
no
longer
stand.
and
we
would
request
respectfully
that
goldman
be
overruled.
and
we
see
no
way
to
get
around
overruling
goldman
if
in
fact
this
new
test
or
anything
similar
to
it
is
going
to
be
applied.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
well,
we
respectfully
submit
that
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
i
think
it
has
been,
yes
sir.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
well,
maybe
not
too
strong,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.as
i
understand
what
olmstead
said,
it
said
that
an
interception
of
the
kind
that
occurred
in
that
case
is
not
a
search
and
is
not
a
seizure.
specifically
in
berger,
this
court
held
that
the
capture
of
a
telephone
conversation
or
a
conversation
isn't
in
the
fourth
amendment,
and
that
it
is
a
seizure.
i
don't
think
that
they
can
be
reconciled,
those
two
propositions.
either
goldman
over
--
strike
to
either
this
court
in
berger
overruled
olmstead.
i
don't
think
it
has
to
be
said
that
it
overruled
it
really
very
strongly
subsequently.
i
think
it
overruled
him.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
that's
case,
yes
sir.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
no
i
don't
--
not
necessarily.
i
think
that
we
couldn't
win
here
by
showing
under
the
court
rule
for
example
there
was
a
warrantless
search
not
founded
upon
probable
cause,
and
not
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
i
think
on
that
basis
alone,
we
would
be
entitled
to
reverse.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
that
assumes
i
suppose
that
you
have
to
make
the
initial
inquiry
that
there
has
been
or
that
there
is
a
constitutionally
protected
area.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
no
question
about
it.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
no
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
i
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
well,
of
course
it
depends
on
how
you
define
trespass.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
well,
certainly
there
was
penetration
of
sound
waves
that
went
from
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
so
that's
the
trespass
is
about
(voice
overlap).
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
well
no
i
think
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
that's
correct.
yes,
i
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
i
think
that's
probably
a
fair
statement.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
yes
sir.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
i'm
sorry
i
did
not
hear
that.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
whether
or
not,
there
is
still
vitality
in
those
decisions.
i
think
it's
clear
that
they
have
not
been
expressly
overruled.
as
far
as
the
trespassory,
we
submit
that
they
should
be
based
on
the
court's
current
trend
of
protecting
privacy
and
getting
away
from
political
trespassers.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
as
far
as
i'm
aware,
that's
true.
i
mentioned
briefly
this
morning
in
passing
that
along
with
the
same
notion
at
least
to
for
a
test
or
anything
similar
as
this,
the
hester
case
also
has
to
go
as
well,
at
least
that
dictum.
i
think
it's
dictum
(voice
overlap)
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
yes
sir.
that
was
--
mr.
justice
holmes
wrote
the
opinion
in
that
case,
the
short
case
actually,
two
agents
had
seen
--
came
on
to
the
defendant's
property,
hid
behind
the
bush
or
something.
from
50
or
100
yards
away,
they
observed
the
defendant
exchanging
with
the
third
person
what
i
believe
was
the
illegal
or
illicit
alcoholic
beverages
or
some
kind.
the
court
had
the
search
and
seizure
issue
before
but
held
that
really
it
didn't
reach
the
search
and
seizure
issue
because
it's
said
in
effect
that
it
was
seeing
the
officers
--
the
agents
were
seeing
a
play
enacted
before
their
eyes
and
didn't
have
to
do
anything
over
in
order
to
intercept.
at
the
very
end
of
the
appendix
to
the
last
or
next
to
the
last
sentence
mr.
justice
holmes
states
in
any
of
event,
an
open
field
is
not
entitled
the
fourth
amendment
protection.
i
think
that
the
statement
was
not
necessary
for
the
decision
in
the
case.
may
i
also
would
submit
that
to
the
extent
that
any
test
similar
that
which
we
propose
is
accepted
by
the
court,
a
test
you
can
not
stand.
i've
also
indicated
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
sir?
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
yes,
we
propose
a
test
using
in
a
way
it's
not
too
dissimilar
from
a
tort,
that
tort
reasonable
man
test.
we're
suggesting
that
what
should
be
used
is
the
communication
setting
should
be
observed
and
those
items
that
should
be
considered
are
the
tone
of
voice,
the
actual
physical
location
where
the
conversation
took
place,
the
activities
on
the
part
of
the
officer.
when
all
those
things
are
considered,
we
would
ask
that
the
test
be
applied
as
to
whether
or
not
a
third
person
objectively
looking
at
the
entire
scene
could
reasonably
interpret
and
could
reasonably
say
that
the
communicator
intended
his
communication
to
be
confidential.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
then
at
least
applying
the
elements
of
our
case,
he
has
certainly
gone
a
step
toward
waiving
the
privilege.
if
you
can
talk
in
terms
of
waiver,
if
he
--
it
has
door
closed
even
but
talks
in
an
extremely
loud
tone
of
voice
so
that
anybody
passing
by
or
using
an
adjacent
booth
can
overhear,
i
think
he
too
has
gone
through
a
step
toward
shedding
himself
of
the
privilege.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
i
said,
i
didn't
mean
to
put
it
in
terms
of
waiver.
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
that
the
constitutional
protection
would
not
apply
the
way
to
phrase
it.
we
--
i
have
indicated
this
morning
that
we
think
that
the
right
to
privacy
which
is
the
fourth
amendment's
concern,
as
i
understand,
follows
the
individual.
and
we
would
base
our
contention
upon
this
by
reading
or
literal
reading
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
respectfully
call
the
court's
attention
that
the
fourth
amendment
after
paraphrasing
a
little
bit
here,
but
it
says
people
have
a
right
to
be
“secure
in
their
persons.”
that
is
the
very
first
item
of
protection
that
is
contained
in
the
first
amendment.
it
says
persons
of
the
fourth
amendment.
it
says
persons
then
it
says
houses.
and
i
believe
it
says
personal
effects
in
one
other
item.
but
it's
significant
to
know
what
i
think,
that
the
very
first
item
of
protection
in
the
fourth
amendment
is
persons.
and
we
would
contend
that
this
fact
is
a
little
credence
to
our
view,
that
privacy
does
follow
the
individual.
we
have
asked
also,
of
course,
to
brief
the
issue
of
the
warrant
that
was
involved
in
this
case
and
to
argue
on
it.
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
earlier,
i
believe
it
was
he
that
if
there
was
an
illegal
search
and
seizure
of
the
telephone
communications,
i
believe
that
the
warrant
to
the
extent
that
it
is
based
on
the
information
obtained
from
that
search
and
that
seizure
must
fall
because
it
would
not
be
based
upon
probable
cause.
i
don't
think
there's
sufficient
evidence
presented
in
the
warrant
absent
the
interception
of
the
telephone
communication
to
have
enabled
the
agent
to
get
a
warrant,
but
assuming
for
purpose
of
argument
that
there
is
sufficient
evidence
or
sufficient
information
present.
we
would
say
that
the
warrant
authorized
the
search
for
mere
evidence.
now,
we
recognized
that
this
argument
applies
right
in
the
face
of
the
court's
recent
decision
in
hayden.
we
are
unable
frankly
to
reconcile
hayden
with
rule
41
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
we
think
that
rules
--
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
fruits
and
instrumentalities.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
in
this
respect,
the
court
in
majority
opinion
in
hayden,
your
honor,
stated
that
rule
41
followed
the
gouled
decision
and
incorporated
the
test
of
gouled.
and
also
the
majority
opinion
in
the
case,
that
the
41
is
a
limitation
or
it
consists
of
the
limitation
on
the
enforcement
officers
to
get
a
warrant
under
a
situation
where
mere
evidence
only
or
exclusively
assault
or
in
addition.
we
think
that
the
congress
has
the
right
to
make
a
statue
or
a
rule
as
in
this
case
more
restrictive
than
that
which
is
minimally
required
by
this
court.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
it's
permissible.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
that's
right
but
we
think
that
based
on
gouled
that
rule
41
was
an
attempt
by
the
congress
to
restrict
it.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
that's
right
but
it
hasn't
been
changed
and
as
far
as
i
know
and
unless
there
is
another
legislative
enactment,
i
think
that
41
still
is
the
law.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
numerous
items,
the
return
of
the
warrant
of
course
is
in
the
record.
there
were
such
things
as
newspaper
clippings,
magazines,
and
telephone
books.
there
were
to
be
sure
items
which
would
normally
be
quick,
considered
book
making
paraphernalia
or
handicapping
information
at
least
of
slips
markers
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
well
i
think
the
markers
in
the
slips
surely
are.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
the
telephone
book?
i
don't
have
(voice
overlap).
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
that
may
well
be.
that
certainly
the
items
that
he
was
using
in
order
to
engage
to
what
ever
activity
he
engaged
in.
i
find
it
difficult
to
concede
that
newspaper
clippings
or
copies
of
sport
magazine
and
that
sort
of
thing
are
fruits
or
instrumentalities.
i
find
it
very
difficult.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
well,
i
think
--
i
frankly
am
unable
to
understand
what
fruits
and
instrumentalities
really
mean.
mr.
harvey
a.
schneider
right.
so
i
must
candidly
admit
that.
however,
it
seems
to
me,
if
you
extend
this
proposition
too
far,
i
suppose
and
i
don't
mean
to
make
light
of
the
situation,
but
if
he
dials
the
telephone
with
his
index
finger,
then
the
government's
entitled
to
an
amputation.
i
don't
think
that's
the
law.
i
think
that
you
can
--
there's
no
end
to
where
you
can
go
on
this
fruits
and
instrumentalities.
unless
there
is
anymore
question,
we
have
a
divided
argument
on
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
--
and
rebuttal
after
the
government
has
presented
its
case.
if
there
are
no
other
questions
i
would
refer
to
mr.
martin
at
this
time.
