justice
potter
stewart
was
the
warrant
placed
on
--
was
the
warrant
obtained
on
the
information
and
obtained
through
bugging?
justice
potter
stewart
or
analyze
the
wrong
word
when
you
say
bugging
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
it?
i
just
said
bugging.
is
this
a
bugging
thing
or
something
else?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
this
just
--
this
just
pick
up
only
what
katz
said
over
the
telephone
or
did
it
also
pick
up
what
was
said
to
him?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
two-way,
was
it?
a
two-way
conversation.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
want
to
get.
that's
all
they
could
pick
up.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
they
get
only
mr.
katz's
in
the
conversation.
justice
potter
stewart
how
was
this
taken?
was
this
automatically
recorded?
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
where
was
the
tape
recorder?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
did
you
answer
me
that
the
affidavit
had
come
which
the
warrant
was
obtained?
was
the
information
obtained
in
this
way?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
it's
possible
that
you're
in
a
telephone
booth.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
are
in
the
telephone
booth,
the
possibility
that
someone
with
the
naked
ear
might
stick
his
ears
next
to
the
wall,
bares
on
whether
or
not
that's
actually
the
situation
that
might
be
regarded
confidential.
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
the
windows
open.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
say
41
authorizes
expressly
searches
and
seizures
whether
it's
fruits
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
that
automatically
that
because
it
doesn't
belong
--
that
in
effect
it
excludes
search
for
real
mere
evidence.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
not
a
constitutional
argument.
this
is
just
that
there
is
presently
no
federal
law
which
authorizes
the
seizure
or
mere
evidence
although
we've
now
said
it
was
a
constitutional
matter.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
permissible.
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
restricted
it
only
in
light
of
the
law
of
gouled.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
think
all
of
these
would
be
instrumentality?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
telephone
book?
justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
there
a
long
list
of
basketball
results
of
various
teams.
justice
potter
stewart
well
the
kind
of
the
business
in
which
he
was
engaged?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
think
anyone
else
did.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
on
the
element
of
specificity,
you
base
reliance
on
the
care
in
the
sense
that
they
record
only
his
conversation.
justice
potter
stewart
they
gather
your
argument
is
they
had
reason
already
to
know
would
have
--
would
be
relevant
to
the
committing
of
the
crime
of
which
finally
he
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
charged,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
instantly,
did
you
argue
i've
forgotten,
did
you
have
probable
cause
to
arrest
him
before
you
intercepted
to
any
of
those?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
immunity
now.
justice
potter
stewart
that
depends,
of
course,
on
the
meaning
of
the
word
penalty
against
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
go
on
in
business?
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
warrant
placed
on
--
was
the
warrant
obtained
on
the

obtained
