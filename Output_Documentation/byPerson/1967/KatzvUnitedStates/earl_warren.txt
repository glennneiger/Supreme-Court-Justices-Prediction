chief

earl
warren
the
government's
claim
that
they
have
probable
cause
for
arresting
him
at
the
time
they
put
this
bug
on?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
martin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
like
to
have
it
define
with
you
or
delineate
that
you
would
please,
what
the
protected
areas
are?
now,
you
--
you
jumped
very
speciously
from
an
open
field
to
a
telephone
booth.
then
you
say
that
if
he
was
in
anyone
else's
office
or
any
place
lawfully
in
a
building
as
i
understood
you,
that,
it
would
be
a
protected
area.
now,
what
is
there
about
the
telephone
booth
that
puts
it
in
the
situation
of
an
open
field?
chief
justice
earl
warren
doesn't
a
man,
when
he
puts
his
money
in
the
box
and
closes
that
door,
and
gets
central,
and
talks
have
the
right
to
--
to
keep
anyone
else
out
or
does
anyone
have
the
right
to
break
in
there
on
him
while
he's
doing
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
is
not
what
we're
talking
about
here.
we're
talking
about
whether
it
is
i
suppose
when
a
man
stood
at
the
window
of
his
home
and
talk
to
somebody
outside
in
the
garden
in
such
a
loud
tone
that
people
on
the
sidewalk
could
hear
it,
it
wouldn't
be
a
protected
area
either,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
why
would
that
be
different
from
--
why
would
the
home
situation
be
different
from
the
telephone
booth?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
those
going
into
somebody
else's
home
that's
(voice
overlap)
and
telephone
him,
would
you
say
that's
a
protected
area?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
well,
let's
say
that
he
had
it
in
someone
else's
office
and
the
rightful
possessor
of
the
office
said
to
the
fbi,
“oh,
you
could
go
in
there
and
bug
in,
if
you
want.”
and
they
went
in
and
did
it.
would
that
change
that
from
a
protected
area
to
a
non-protected
area?
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
say
they're
acting
in
the
same
sense
that
they
were
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
probably,
the
only
difference
that
i
can
see
is
that
here,
a
man
went
into
the
telephone
booth,
in
a
place
that
was
presumably
private
according
to
the
intentions
of
the
telephone
company.
it
had
a
door,
you
could
close
it,
and
it
was
a
small
place
with
only
one
person
that
could
reasonably
be
in.
and
there
was
a
telephone
there.and
he
paid
for
the
privilege
of
using
that.
and
then
after
that,
the
telephone
company
said
to
the
fbi,
“it's
alright,
let's
go
ahead
and
put
the
bug
in.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
not
many
homes
are
soundproof.
chief
justice
earl
warren
perhaps
not
as
much
but
you
certainly
expect
it
to
be
private
and
you
don't
talk
to
the
world,
then
you
talk
on
the
telephone
there,
do
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
the
room
was
a
little
larger
and
a
little
more
firmly
built,
and
it
couldn't
be
opened
from
the
outside
after
the
person
went
in
and
close
the
door,
would
that
change
with
any
of
your
opinion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
know
sometimes
public
telephones
where
you
pay
telephones
are
out
on
a
long,
long
bench.
they're
out
open
there
where
no
one
can,
or
that
anybody
can
hear
what's
going
on
if
they're
close
enough.
why
do
you
suppose
they
put
those
booths
in?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
find
them
in
hotels,
you
find
them
in
office
buildings,
or
anyplace
else
where
there
isn't
any
particular
noise
to
disturb
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
you
told
me
a
moment
ago
that
if
they
have
made
the
room
more
secure
from
sound
waves
and
had
made
it
evident
that
they
expected
that
there
would
be
a
room
where
they
would
speak
confidentially
that
it
would
be
a
different
situation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
sentence
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
rather
extensive
operation
here
to
convict
this
man,
it
took
sometime
to
try
him.
what
was
the
sentence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
$300
fine?
mr.
marks
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
mr.
schneider
to
say
that
he
thought
there
was
not
a
probable
cause
but
that
the
government
did.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
wasn't
probable
cause
for
an
arrest
but
was
it
a
probable
cause
for?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
have
positive
information
that
he
was
using
--
he
was
going
into
that
telephone
booth
to
carry
on
his
business
of
wagering.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
that
under
berger,
that
would
have
entitled
them
to
a
search
warrant
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
this
character
to
permit
them
to
do
what
they
did
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
conceding
would
you
mind
to
talk
as
just
what
is
left
with
your
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
your
own
case?
