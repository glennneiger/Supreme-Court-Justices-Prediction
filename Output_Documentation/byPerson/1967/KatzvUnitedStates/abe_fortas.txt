justice
abe
fortas
i
know.
but
isn't
the
test
somewhat
closer
to
what
a
citizen
like
reasonably
expect
to
--
they
immunized
from
the
particular
kind
of
activity,
whether
it's
oversight
or
overhearing.
justice
abe
fortas
probably
going
into
a
glass
telephone
booth,
i
suppose
can
reasonably
expect
to
be
overseen
that
going
into
a
glass
telephone
booth,
assuming
that
it's
reasonably
soundproof
which
your
--
says
it
is
not.
but
assuming
that
it's
reasonably
a
soundproof,
then
going
into
a
glass
telephone
booth
might
readily
assume
that
he
was
conducting
a
private
conversation.
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
put
to
you
another
situation.
suppose
there's
a
large
gathering
on
the
times
square
and
somebody
is
making
a
public
speech
there,
he
has
to
expect
that
he
will
be
overheard.
that's
his
purpose
and
intention.
suppose
there
on
the
crowd,
a
man
is
there
with
a
friend
and
he
turns
to
a
friend
to
his
family,
said
little
something
in
a
low
tone
of
voice.
and
at
the
same
place
at
the
same
area,
same
plot
of
ground,
same
circumstances,
but
one
expects
that
he
will
be
overheard,
and
the
other
expects
that
what
he
is
saying
is
in
private.
would
you
draw
a
distinction
between
those
cases?
justice
abe
fortas
why?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
it's
because
of
the
place?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
that
got
to
do
with
anything?
justice
abe
fortas
well
the
holmes'
quotation,
when
you've
take
in
context
seems
to
me
the
reasonable
any
other
man
in
an
open
view
in
an
open
field.
and
i
don't
suppose
you
could
never
overseen
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
they
could
reasonably
expect
that
they
wouldn't
be
overseen.
well
if
they
use
an
example,
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
is
in
dissent
or
something.
that
might
very
well
be
able
to
rely
on
the
assumption
that
not
being
overheard
and
nobody
is
planning
of
a
parabolic
microphone
or
something
of
this
sort
to
pick
that
conversation.
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
privacy
is
restricted
to
the
booth
wall?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
know,
but
is
that
a
legal
principle?
is
that
a
legal
principle
that
you're
now
saying?
justice
abe
fortas
what
kind
of
protection
can
we
--
within
our
jurisdiction
what
kind
of
protection
can
we
concur
out
of
them.
i
mean
it's
either
there
isn't
an
upfront
to
the
fourth
amendment
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
trying
to
get
that
following
to
mr.
justice
white's
question.
what
difference
does
it
make
that
the
fbi
agents
were
carefully
and
discrete
instead
of
keeping
the
tape
recorders
on
all
day
and
all
night,
record
everything.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
it's
unreasonable
as
to
everybody
else
would
use
the
phone
booth,
mrs.jones
comes
in
and
telephones
a
daughter,
anybody
else
in
this
phonebook.
that
wouldn't
make
it
unreasonable
so
far
as
mr.
katz
has
been
said
earlier.
justice
abe
fortas
the
first
argument
is
correct.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
instead
of
going
into
a
phone
booth,
he
had
gone
into
the
office
of
somebody
--
somebody
or
in
his
own
office,
what
--
would
that
be
a
protected
area
so
far
as
he
was
concerned?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
anybody's
office
is
a
protected
area
to
everybody.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
what
difference
would
it
make
when
they
broke
into
the
office?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
you're
on
a
neighbor's
house
for
a
cocktail
and
he
said
excuse
me
and
went
to
the
next
room
and
use
the
telephone.
could
that
be
a
protected
area
so
far
as
use
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
perhaps
if
there
were
las
vegas
motel
that
was
soundproof
and
made
of
sturdy
material
that
that
would
be
this
case.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
if
they
are
just
ordinary
telephone,
telephone
booth
is
installed
by
the
telephone
company
that
said
las
vegas
for
gamblers
only
(laughter).
it's
soundproof
and
that
it's
sturdily
constructed
that
it
might
be
in
this
case.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me,
did
you
--
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
if
we
should
reverse
for
a
new
trial
that
the
immunity
which
petitioner
has
acquired
would
prevent
a
new
trial?
justice
abe
fortas
why
would
you
relay
the
procedure?
why
don't
you
wait
until
that
comes
up?
justice
abe
fortas
that's'
why.
are
you
talking
about
--
are
you
telling
us
that
the
department
would
not
retry
him
or
are
you
saying
that
the
department
believes
that
the
effect
of
the
immunity
would
mean
that
he
could
not
be
retried?
justice
abe
fortas
so
he
went
away
that's
another
aspect,
different
from
frank
even,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but
there
are
no
decisions
on
that,
are
there?
