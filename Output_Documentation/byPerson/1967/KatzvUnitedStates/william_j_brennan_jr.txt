so
that
parabolic
mic
on
the
two
people
conversing
in
the
field
a
mile
away
might
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
again
that
none
of
them
was
present
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
really
though,
goldman
and
that
aspect
of
olmstead,
didn't
they
rather
turn
on
the
old
notion
of
a
trust
facility
intrusion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
to
the
extent
that
olmstead,
that
element
of
olmstead
that
you
have
to
see
his
tangibles,
that
berger
and
wong
sun,
and
others
have
said
it's
not
so.
conversation
may
be
seized.
but
certainly
they
are
still
to
that
extent
at
least
expressly,
even
though
what
the
court
has
done
in
abandoning
the
old
property
concepts
thinking
of
the
last
two.
it
still
remains
i
take
it
to
the
extent
trespassory
intrusions
or
an
element
of
the
fourth
amendment
protection.
that
hasn't
--
that
argument
hasn't
yet
been
expressly
ruled,
has
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
therefore,
won't
you
really
have
expressed
it
over
goldman?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
here
we
don't
have
a
trespassory
intrusion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know,
i
must
say.
this
was
on
the
top
of
this
telephone
booth.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh!
i
know
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
i
don't
think
is
what
trespassory
meant
before
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
berger,
you
did
have
a
trespassory
intrusion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
think
you
would
have
to
concede
the
element
of
trespassory
intrusion
is
still
not
the
expressly
at
least.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
i
must
say,
you
certainly
have
what
we've
been
saying
properties
into
concepts
are
no
longer
the
underpinning
invasion
of
privacy.
that's
going
for
you,
then
i
still
question
whether
there
is
that
much
left
to
go
with
olmstead.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
whether
there
is
still
left
both
with
goldman
and
olmstead.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
would
suppose
once
--
when
the
court
has
accepted
and
now
it
has,
those
privacy
invasions
of
privacy
rather
than
property
concepts,
trespassers
are
property
concept.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
in
this
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
is
that
waiver
so
much
analytically
is
that
there's
simply
no
invasion
of
privacy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
are
the
requirements
for
activating
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
you
are
also
saying
mr.
martin
that
this
is
reversed
on
one
of
these
grounds
that
the
evidence
which
would
be
available
on
the
retrial
would
not
be
sufficient
to
convict
anyone.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
if
the
taped
conversations
may
not
be
used
and
if
the
search
warrant
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
tied
to
those
conversations,
therefore,
you
can't
use
what
you
got
in
the
apartment
too,
then
you
don't
have
anything
else
on
which
to
convict
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
there
infrared
devices
now
that
could
go
through
brick
walls
and
see
what's
inside?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
we
have
to
overrule
reina
to
do
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
