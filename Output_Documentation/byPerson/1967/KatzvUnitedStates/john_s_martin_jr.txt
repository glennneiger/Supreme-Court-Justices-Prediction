mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
the
heart
of
petitioner's
argument
to
a
certain
extent
is
a
radical
change
in
the
concept
to
the
fourth
amendment.
i
think
as
mr.
justice
brennan
mentioned,
it
has
been
said
in
recent
years
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
more
rights
of
privacy
than
rights
in
property.
however
this
court
has
never
held
the
right
of
privacy
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment,
does
not
exist
within
the
framework
of
a
constitutionally
protected
area.
as
counsel
mentioned,
mr.
justice
holmes
speaking
for
unanimous
court,
this
court's
opinion
in
hester
versus
the
united
states,
said
very
clearly,
â€œthe
protections
of
the
fourth
amendment
do
not
extend
to
an
open
field.
to
adapt
the
test
which
counsel
has
suggested
in
this
case
would
radically
change
the
rules
under
which
law
enforcement
has
been
operating
for
a
long
time
with
the
approval
of
this
court,
and
i
mean
it
in
this
sense.
it
seems
to
me
that
to
say
that
no
matter
where
the
activity
takes
place,
it
is
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
the
subjects
to
that
amendment
not
only
the
matter
of
what
is
overheard,
but
what
is
observed.
assume,
if
you
would
please,
the
following
situation.
take
the
case
that
we
have
here.
and
instead
of
the
agents
being
interested
in
hearing
what
mr.
marks
said,
but
let's
assume
it
was
a
kidnapping
case
and
they
knew
that
this
booth
had
been
used
on
one
occasion
too
by
the
kidnapper
to
call
with
regard
to
ransom.
and
the
kidnapper
had
scheduled
to
call
for
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening.
so
as
not
to
scare
him
off,
the
agents
might
station
themselves
in
another
building
some
distance
away,
and
armed
with
binoculars
perhaps
even
in
infrared
scope
that
would
allow
them
to
see
at
night,
put
this
telephone
booth
under
surveillance.
the
kidnapper
would
approach
that
booth.
he
might
look
around
to
make
sure
that
he
was
secured,
that
nobody
was
observing
him.
he
would
be
wrong
in
his
conclusion.
i
assumed
that
under
mr.
mark's
--
mr.
schneider's
rationale
that
the
fact
that
the
agents
saw
him
entered
the
booth,
but
they
could
not
testify
that
that
would
be
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
i
think
that
this
court
has
always
recognized
the
doctrine.
that
one
is
protected
is
the
right
to
privacy
which
exists
within
a
constitutionally
protected
area,
within
a
home,
within
an
office,
some
area
in
which
the
party
involved
has
an
interest.
it
may
not
have
to
be
a
property
interest
of
a
tenant
or
an
owner,
maybe
that
of
a
guest
in
those
premises.
but
it
exists
only
within
the
framework
of
a
constitutionally
protected
area.
we
submit
on
an
analysis
in
that
term
what
occurred
here
did
not
occur
in
a
constitutionally
protected
area.
as
we
see
it,
there
is
no
significant
difference
between
the
telephone
booth
involved
in
this
case
and
an
open
field.
an
occupant
in
a
public
telephone
booth
is
just
as
subject
to
visual
surveillance
as
a
man
standing
in
an
open
field.
these
phone
booths
are
neither
designed
nor
are
they
considered
to
be
totally
sound
proof.
it's
rather
easy
to
overhear
this
i
think
all
of
us
know.
conversation
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
i
don't
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
i
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
i
would
not,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
what
is
taking
place
is
taking
place
in
the
public
area.
seems
to
me
if
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
but
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
the
difference
between
whether
or
not
they
feel
that
they're
being
overheard
or
that
somebody
is
observing
them
from
afar
with
binoculars
is
no
difference.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
it
maybe
that
two
people
meet
to
pass
stolen
goods.
and
they
meet
in
an
abandoned
area
that
they
think
nobody
is
observing.
and
if
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
not
to
the
booth
wall,
certainly
not
to
the
booth
wall,
but
it
is
restricted
to
some
area
in
which
there
is
a
private
interest.
i
think
that
has
been
the
law
today.
that
is
the
law
that
has
been
followed.
i
don't
--
what
i'm
getting
at
most
particularly
is
i
don't
see
drawing
a
distinction
between
overhearing
and
viewing.
and
this
court
has
said
on
the
number
of
occasions
that
it
is
perfectly
proper
to
for
law
enforcement
officials
to
use
means
to
observe
what
is
going
on
in
distant
areas,
to
use
binoculars,
telescopes
that
was
mentioned
mr.
justice
brandeis,
again
running
for
unanimous
court
in
united
states
versus
lee.
i
think
that
this
has
always
been
recognized,
and
i
don't
see
any
rational
basis
withdrawing
the
distinction
between
what
is
being
said
and
what
is
being
done
and
being
observed.
and
we
assumed
that
drawing
on
that
concept,
what
is
involved
here
is
not
an
area.
that
in
which
the
occupant
of
the
booth
gets
any
private
interest,
while
the
booth
might
be
provided
for
his
convenience,
certainly
there
is
no
difference
in
the
rate
he
pays
if
that
booth
and
if
the
phone
is
hung
upon
in
open
wall.
he
takes
no
interest
in
the
premises.
and
we
say
under
these
circumstances,
under
the
rule
in
the
hester
case
and
the
lee
case,
this
is
not
a
constitutional
protected
area.
and
therefore
in
the
circumstance
of
this
case,
there
was
no
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
but
we
suggest
also
that
even
if
this
court
were
to
find,
that
a
public
phone
booth
was
entitled
to
some
degree
or
protection
under
the
fourth
amendment,
that
what
was
done
by
the
agents
in
this
case,
did
meet
the
standards
of
the
fourth
amendment,
when
we're
viewing
the
particular
type
of
premises
involved.
i
would
like
if
might
to
just
go
into
some
of
the
background
of
what
was
done
in
this
case.
early
in
february
of
1965,
the
agents
received
information
from
reliable
informants,
which
led
them
to
believe
that
the
petition
in
this
case,
mr.
katz,
was
using
the
public
phone,
this
particular
public
phone
booth
to
place
wages
in
interstate
by
calling
massachusetts.
on
to
that
information,
they
undertook
surveillance
both
to
katz.
they
found
that
he
was
using
this
particular
booth
which
was
approximately
four
blocks
from
his
hotel.
on
a
regular
basis
at
regular
periods
of
the
day,
having
surveilled
into
this
booth
on
a
number
of
occasions
they
didn't
check
the
telephone
records,
telephone
company.
they
found
that
he
was
calling
the
number
of
a
known
gambler
in
massachusetts.
it
was
only
after
or
they
had
all
of
this
information
that
the
agents
undertook
the
surveillance
in
this
case.
after
they
had
all
of
this
information
they
then
set
up
a
system
involving
a
team
of
five
agents.
the
recorder
was
placed
on
the
top
of
the
phone
booth.
it
had
two
microphones.
one
microphone
was
attached
to
each
of
two
booths.
they
were
taped
on
the
top
of
the
booth.
the
surveilling
agents
were
there
at
the
hotel.
they
would
follow
mr.
katz
as
he
left
his
hotel
and
at
a
point
approximately
one
and
half
blocks
from
the
phone
booth.
when
he
got
to
that
point,
the
surveilling
agents
would
call
and
radio
to
the
agents
at
the
booth,
who
at
that
point
would
go
over
and
activate
the
recorder.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
your
honor,
it's
just
not
clear
in
the
record.
i
assume
that
from
all
the
description
that
it's
found
in
the
record,
it
seems
to
be
just
a
regular
tape
recorder
that
you
would
just
switch
on.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
so
they
waited
until
he
was
coming.
they
activated
the
recorder.
he
came
and
placed
his
calls.
as
soon
as
he
left
the
area,
the
agents
deactivated
the
recorder.
indeed
there
was
one
occasion
where
he
left
the
area,
they
gone
over
and
turned
it
off.
they
got
where
to
he
was
coming
back
again.
they
switch
it
back
on.
but
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
the
area
of
the
phone
booth,
that
tape
recorder
was
turned
off.
the
resembler
was
very
careful
on
this
case
by
the
agents
was
only
one
occasion
this
was
done
for
six
days.
and
only
one
day
did
an
innocent
party
come
in
and
used
that
booth
during
the
period
of
surveillance.
the
agents
testified
with
regard
to
that
conversation
that
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
we
would
assume
--
we
would
say
in
the
first
place
that
it
not
been
a
constitutionally
protected
area,
that
there
is
no
right.
the
fourth
amendment
just
doesn't
apply
to
the
open
field
then
we
say
to
a
public
telephone
booth.
we
say
that
alternatively
if
this
court
feels
that
it
is
should
accord
some
degree
of
protection
for
public
phone
booth,
our
argument
is
basically
that,
well
here,
if
some
degree
of
protection
is
afforded
to
public
phone
booth,
it
is
not
necessarily
the
same
type
of
protection
that
would
be
accorded
to
a
private
home
or
an
office.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
that
is
one
of
our
arguments,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
it
is
our
argument
mr.
justice
fortas.
this
is
not
an
upfront
to
fourth
amendment.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
set
down
any
hard
and
fast
rules.
the
fourth
amendment
sets
up
a
standard
of
reasonableness.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
fortas,
this
is
based
upon
our
alternative
argument.
we
argued
initially
that
a
public
telephone
booth
is
not
a
constitutionally
protected
area.
alternatively,
we
argued
that
even
if
it
were
to
be
considered
by
this
court
to
be
an
area,
entitled
to
some
degree
of
protection
under
the
fourth
amendment.
that
the
fourth
amendment
turns
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
particular
search
involved
was
reasonable.
and
this
court
has
often
said
that
question
of
reasonableness
must
be
determined
upon
the
facts
in
each
case.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
i
do
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
the
fourth
amendment
has
directed
a
conduct
of
law
enforcement
officers.
and
i
think
this
court
can
determine
whether
or
not,
under
the
fourth
amendment
that
conduct
was
reasonable
getting
the
circumstances
that
they
were
viewing,
the
probable
cause
they
had
to
believe
a
crime
was
being
committed,
and
also
taking
all
those
factors
into
consideration.
what
were
the
steps
that
they
took?
did
they
take
a
wholesale
of
shotgun
approach
to
this?
or,
did
they
exercise
--?
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
it
comes
also
from
the
osborn
opinion
where
the
court
said
that
here
we
had
a
discrete
use
of
the
electronic
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
that
they
had
a
reason
to
believe,
he
was
using
this
for
the
specific
purpose
of
committing
the
violation
of
federal
law.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
this
was
not
--
actually
talking
in
these
terms
in
the
brief.
i
would
think
there
was
probable
cause.
they
had
reliable
information
that
he
was
using
the
phone
to
call
known
gamblers.
a
check
of
the
records
of
the
telephone
company
indicated
that
he
was
calling
a
number
of
a
known
gambler
in
massachusetts.
i
think
this
would
amount
to
probable
cause.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
there
are
two
problems
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
we
had
a
probable
cause
to
get
a
search
warrant.
but
i
do
think
that
this
court
has
often
recognized
that
the
probable
cause
is
not
equivalent
to
evidence
of
guilt
beyond
unreasonable
doubt
which
you
had
to
satisfy
a
jury
and
i
don't
think
i
would
want
to
take
this
case
before
the
jury
on
just
what
we
had
at
the
time
the
electronic
surveillance.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
you
could
have
got
the
warrant
for
his
apartment.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
i
think
there
was
still
a
shortage
of
proof
on
the
exact
--
all
of
these,
the
evidence
in
the
apartment
showed
that
he
came
within
that
aspect
of
the
statute
which
requires
that
the
person
is
affected
by
be
engaged
in
the
business
of
gambling.
i
think
that
the
evidence,
the
rundown
chiefs
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
and
i
don't
think
that
we
could
have
done
that,
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
jury
beyond
unreasonable
doubt
with
judge
what
we
had
prior
to
the
electronic
surveillance
and
on
the
basis
of
what
we
see
on
the
arrest
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
certainly
that's
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
for
anybody
who
is
legitimately
on
these
premises,
i
suppose
that
it's
not
a
protected
area
if
he
broke
into
the
office.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
but
if
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
under
this
court's
opinion,
in
the
jones
case,
that
was
indicated
that
you
had
to
be
rightfully
there.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
have
no
right
in
the
premises
at
all
in
which
in
fact
you're
in
acting
interrogation
to
the
rights
of
the
true
owner.
i
think
that
then,
you
would
not
be
accorded
any
protection
in
that
area
whether
that
you
would
be
in
a
public
place.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
most
definitely.
it
is
our
contention
that
that
would
be
then,
but
we're
dealing
with
a
public
phone
booth.
we
are
dealing
with
something
different.
and
it's
our
position
that
even
if
this
court
would
have
said
that
public
phone
booth
wasn't
type
of
some
degree
of
protection
under
the
fourth
amendment,
that
it
is
not
the
same
protection
that
comes
to
a
house.
public
phone
booth
is
more
closely
analogous
we
submit
to
a
public
field
certainly
that
it
is
to
a
home.
and
a
party
in
a
public
phone
booth
has
no
right
to
expect
that
he
is
going
to
be
accorded
all
the
protection
he
would
be
in
a
private
house.
we
submit
that
what
was
done
here
was
not
an
indiscriminate
search
and
seizure
that
such
was
condemned
by
this
court
in
irvine.
it
was
a
very
careful.
it
was
carefully
limited
one
to
only
involving
a
particular
petitioner
in
this
case.
innocent
members
of
the
public
were
not
subject
to
surveillance.
the
only
one
instance
which
has
happened,
the
agents
testified,
that
the
tape
recorder
involved
was
a
stereotype,
had
two
tracks
a
and
b.
they
could
control
which
conversation
they
would
listen
to.
and
they
did
not
in
fact
listen
to
the
conversation
of
the
innocent
party.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
what
i
would
say
that
it
is
under
this
court's
opinion
in
berger,
i
think
the
words
were
seized.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
certainly,
i
think
in
this
case
they
we're
the
actual
means
and
instrumentalities
of
the
crime.
the
crime
is
to
transport
wagering
information
or
wagers
over
the
interstate
facilities,
telephone
facilities.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
the
reason
the
agents
didn't
get
warrant
in
this
particular
case
is
a
very
practical
one.
i
think
the
agents
in
this
case
as
mr.
schneider
said
they've
done
their
homework.
and
they
were
relying
upon
this
court's
decision
of
goldman,
and
felt
that
they
had
complied
with
that,
that
there
was
no
penetration
to
a
constitutional
protected
area.
and
therefore,
it
was
for
that
reason,
they
didn't
seek
warrant.
also
under
rule
41,
there
would
be
some
difficulty.
and
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
either
way,
i
think
it
is
questionable
whether
or
not
you
could
get
a
warrant
for
the
seizure
of
words
in
rule
41
by
its
terms.
to
often
date,
it
says
that
warrant
shall
issue
for
the
seizure
of
property.
and
it
later
defines
property
as
any
books,
records,
documents,
or
other
tangible
property.
so
there
is
a
problem
under
rule
41
as
to
whether
or
not,
you
could
get
a
warrant.
i
do
think
that
the
practical
reason
in
this
case
was
the
agent's
reliance
on
goldman.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
do
think,
mr.
justice
white,
that
this
court
has
said
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
with
two
things,
i
think
constitutionally.
that's
what
we're
talking
about,
were
talking
about
constitutional.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
i
--
i
don't
--
i
think
one
that
that
is
s
you
say
if
you're
talking
just
outside
the
constitutional
framework,
i
certainly
don't
think
the
fact
that
it's
not
included
with
the
federal
rules
raises
a
constitutional
issue.
and
i'm
not
sure
that
in
fact,
it's
not
accorded
to
the
federal
rules
requires
therefore
exclusion.
i
think
that
there
have
been
cases
where
they
said
that
the
fact
of
rule
wasn't
a
requirement.
it
doesn't
necessarily
invalidate
everything
that
was
done.
but
going
pass
that,
i
think
that
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
court's
opinion
even
though
the
rules
now
provide
of
an
inherent
power
where
perhaps
a
search
warrant
could
have
been
obtained.
i
think
this
was
-
you
had
the
same
situation
to
osborn
where
the
court
proved
a
warrant.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
might
be
some
question
under
whether
that
was
in
full
conformity
with
rule
41
because
the
problem
with
the
rule
authorizing
only
the
seizure
property.
so
i
think
there
is
an
--
i
think
historically
there
isn't
basis
or
a
view
that
a
warrant
could
have
issued
as
you
said
under
41,
it
could
not
happened.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
you
could
have
sustain
a
warrant
in
such
that
i
record
upon
to
that
tackled
advise,
i
would
advise
them
to
get
a
warrant
and
let's
litigate
that
issue.
i
think
that
there
is
a
reasonable
argument
that
can
be
made.
the
rule
is
really
not
designed
with
this
inline,
that
it
was
using
the
term
property
as
broad
as
it
built
that
term
was
used
in
campus,
everything
under
the
fourth
amendment.
and
has
been
said,
berger
overrules
the
prior
told
that
words
we're
not
subject
to
seizure.
you
can
reasonably
read
and
the
intent
of
the
drafters
of
the
rule
that
they
would
want
rules
to
cover
anything
subject
to
seizure.
so
i
think
that
there
is
an
argument
that
can
be
made.
it
is
basically
our
position
then
that
even
though
there
was
not
a
warrant
in
this
place,
what
was
done
here
was
reasonable.
this
court
has
indicated
that
far
back
as
carroll
versus
the
united
states,
last
year
in
see
versus
city
of
seattle
that
what
is
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment
may
vary
to
a
certain
extend
upon
the
nature
of
the
premises
that
are
involved,
that
are
subject
to
the
search
and
seizure.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
in
berger
i
don't
believe,
mr.
justice
black
as
i
read
the
court's
opinion
that
was
what
they
were
saying.
i
think
what
they
--
it
was
ultimately
condemned
in
berger
was
the
fact
that
the
warrant
that
issued
was
a
general
warrant
that
allowed
the
police
in
acting
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
what
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
black,
they
did
in
the
berger
case
cite
goldman
and
indicating
that
it
had
some
continuing
validity.
so
i
don't
think
it
all
intended
to
be
as
broad
as
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
but
i
don't
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
can
only
say
that
i
can
agree
with
your
reading
in
the
berger
case,
mr.
justice
black.
as
i
see
it,
what
was
condemned
in
that
case
was
a
situation
where
a
general
warrant
was
used
to
allow
law
enforcement
officers
to
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
the
court
said
that
it
was
a
general
warrant.
it
said
that
what
if
in
any
event
what
the
warrant
did
do
was
authorized
over
a
period
of
60
days,
the
indiscriminate
use
of
an
eavesdropping
device
to
pick
out
everything
that
was
going
on
within
an
office
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
i
think
that's
the
nature
of
the
fourth
amendment,
mr.
justice
black
that
everything
--
the
right
to
a
warrant
is
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
do
think
that
the
fourth
amendment
still
as
construed
by
this
court
carries
with
it
the
concept
of
reasonableness.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
carries
with
it
the
concept
of
judging
the
action
and
determining
whether
that
action
was
reasonable.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
supposed
it's
a
gross
invasion.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
sir
that's
it's
a
gross
invasion
of
privacy.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
it's
reasonable
when
viewed
in
a
light
of
everything
that
has
gone
on.
i
think
it's
a
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
as
to
whether
or
not
what
has
been
done
comports
that
this
stand
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
the
court
has
said
that
eavesdropping
in
all
cases
is
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
it
indicated
in
which
it
certainly
was,
and
that
was
the
berger
case,
that
certainly
in
this
case,
where
you
authorize
people
to
go
in
and
indiscriminately
60
days,
that
that
is
a
violation
to
the
fourth
amendment.
but
i
don't
think
that
it
in
any
sense
precluded
the
question
when
you
have
a
very
discriminate
use.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
in
this
case?
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
i
will
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
would
point
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
say
it
would
be
reasonable
mr.
justice
black,
if
you
had
strong
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
conversation
that
you
would
overhear
would
relate
to
the
specific
commission
of
a
federal
crime.
and
if
the
action
which
you
took
to
overhear
those
conversations
was
such
is
to
protect
innocent
members
of
the
public
from
having
their
conversations
indiscriminately
overheard,
i
think
that
in
these
conditions
which
are
the
conditions
that
we
have
here,
that
meets
the
reasonableness
standard
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
would
now
like
to
turn,
if
i
may,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
would
say,
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
difference
is
the
right
that
you
have
to
exclude
others
from
the
area
in
which
you're
acting.
certainly
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
he
certainly
has
no
right
to
keep
people
from
standing
right
next
to
him
where
they
could
hear
exactly
what
is
going
on.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
would
not
be
protected
under
the
fourth
amendment.
that's
right.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
because
the
home
is
an
area
in
which
a
man
can
withdraw
and
can
he
so
choses
protect
himself.
and
no
one
has
the
right
to
enter
into
a
man's
home
for
any
purpose.
i
think
that
is
the
difference
between
--
the
man
has
an
interest
in
his
home
which
is
to
be
protected.
and
if
this
was
the
interest
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
drawing
to
protect,
the
man
has
a
right
and
to
say
to
anybody,
you
cannot
come
here
unless
you
can
so
chose
some
justification
under
the
law.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
--
the
office
is
definitely
a
protected
area.
the
question
really
has
been
drawn
then
in
terms
of
standing
and
who
has
standing
to
assert
the
protection
that
that
office
is
afforded.
and
this
court
has
said
that
it
is
not
a
merely
the
owner
who
has
that
standing.
that
is
anyone
in
the
premises
but
it's
the
nature
of
the
premises
again
to
just
protect
it.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
if
he
was
acting
--
if
the
fbi
was
acting
with
the
consent
of
the
person,
your
honor,
this
was
in
the
least
situation.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
then
i
would
think
that
that
would
not
be
protected.that's
right
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
because
the
nature
of
the
fourth
amendment
has
always
been
such.
it's
true
that
it
arises
from
the
right
of
a
person
to
exclude
others
from
a
particular
area
which
is
under
his
control
and
absent
of
that
right
to
exclude
others
there
is
no
right
under
the
fourth
amendment.
i
think
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
designed
to
protect
public
from
trespass
by
law
enforcement
officer
who
was
designed
to
protect
the
individual
in
cases
where
law
enforcement
people
would
break
into
their
homes,
break
into
their
offices,
and
search
generally.
but
the
interest
always
under
the
fourth
amendment
with
some
interest
of
the
individual,
some
area
in
which
he
had
the
right
to
withdraw,
and
to
be
free
from
government
scrutiny.
i
just
--
i
submit
that
that
is
the
distinction
that
has
been
drawn
and
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
even
if
you
assume,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
there
is
some
degree
of
protection
to
be
afforded
to
the
public
telephone,
that
what
was
done
here
was
reasonable
did
protect
whatever
interest
there
is
the
public
might
have
in
the
public
telephone.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
he
withdrew
--
he
went
into
a
booth.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
but
that
was
a
booth
that
was
not
a
soundproof,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
but
i
mean
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
go
into
a
public
phone
booth
you
cannot
--
don't
expect
that
you're
going
to
be
as
protected
in
that
area
as
you
are
in
your
home.
that
it's
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
of
course,
you
don't.
you
do
run
the
risk
of
course
that
you
would
be
overheard
by
people
passing
by,
by
people
on
adjoining
booths.
we
think
that
in
any
event
that
accepting
your
major
premise
that
this
is
entitled
to
some
degree
of
protection.
that
the
protection
of
that
is
entitled
to
is
not
necessarily
have
to
be
made
exactly
coextensive
with
the
protection
would
be
provided
for
home.
then
if
you
provide
that
you
can
only
eavesdrop
in
situations
such
as
this,
where
the
equipment
is
discretely
used,
and
only
when
there
is
ample
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
phone
booth
is
then
and
there
being
used
for
the
condition
of
a
federal
crime.
that
would
legitimately
protect
any
interest
to
be
protected
in
a
public
phone
booth.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
if
in
it
was
such
that
you
could
reasonably
draw
the
conclusion
that
what
we
were
doing
was
not
just
merely
having
this
as
a
convenience
to
what
exclude
some
peripheral
noise.
and
perhaps
there
would
be
a
different
charge
for
using
this
particular
type
of
phone
booth.
then
you
might
conclude
that
the
party
--
it
was
intended
the
party
using
that
booth
receives
some
interest
such
as
brief
though,
may
be
a
least,
but
i
don't
think
they
do
have
that
in
a
normal
public
telephone.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
that
they
put
the
booths
particularly
on
the
street
to
exclude
some
of
the
strenuous
noise
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
that
one,
you
do
now
and
you're
really
having
a
sheet
more
to
the
open
type
of
booth.
i
don't
think
that
the
telephone
company
when
they
put
in,
whether
it'd
be
an
open
booth
or
closed
booth,
things
that
they
are
conferring
greater
or
less
rights
on
the
people
who
are
using
the
phone.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
then
you
might
expect
that
they
--
what
they
are
doing
is
that
they
are
conferring,
they
are
expected
to
find,
building
this
type
of
booth
and
providing
this
type
of
facility.
they
are
providing
something
much
different
than
mere
public
phone
booth
or
the
open
phone.
i
would
like
if
may
now
to
address
myself
to
the
question
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
exactly,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
it
might
be
his
office.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
it
would
certainly
be
a
different
case,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
would
like
to
be
permitted
now
turning
the
question,
we
support
specifically
directed
counsel
in
the
brief
had
argued.
and
that
is
the
quoting
of
frank
v.
united
sates
as
it
affects
this
case.
this
arises
from
the
following
facts,
subsequent
to
the
time
the
petitioner's
appeal
was
affirmed,
he
was
called
before
a
grand
jury
in
the
southern
district
of
florida.
and
pursuant
to
section
409(l)
of
the
communications
act,
he
was
granted
immunity
and
was
questioned
and
in
fact
gave
answers
about
the
telephone
calls
between
the
subject
matter
of
this
indictment.
now,
we
concede
at
the
outset
of
these
questioning
had
taken
place
prior
to
the
trial
of
this
case.
the
petitioner
could
not
have
been
tried
that
he
would
have
had
immunity
from
prosecution.
we
would
consider
also
that
if
this
court
would
adopt
the
holding
in
frank
v.united
states,
the
conviction
would
have
to
be
vacated.
it
is
our
position
that
frank
v.
united
states
was
incorrectly
decided.
neither
the
circuit
court
in
frank
nor
petitioner
in
their
brief
in
this
court
has
suggested
any
reason
from
either
the
legislative
history,
the
communications
act
immunity
section
or
in
the
fourth
amendment
why
the
privilege
conferred
by
the
immunity
statute
must
be
immunity
conferred,
must
be
viewed
to
be
retroactive.
this
court
has
expressly
rejected
that
concept
in
the
case
of
reina
v.
united
states
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
if
there
was
a
retrial
in
this
case?
if
--
assuming
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
we
will
not
be
tried.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
that
is
correct.
we
would
not
take
the
decision
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
and
i
think
in
the
future
he
has
immunity.
but
from
anything
in
the
past,
he
stands
convicted.
and
there
is
no
reason
to
apply
that
immunity
retroactively,
that's
our
position.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
it
says
penalty
--
we
submit
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
indicate
that
the
denial,
the
grant
or
denial
relieved
by
this
court
could
be
considered
a
penalty
under
the
act.
and
when
it
talked
of
penalty,
it
talked
in
terms
of
any
future
prosecution
or
future
use
of
the
evidence
obtained
that
might
violate
his
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment.
but
this
court
specifically
held
in
the
reina
case,
that
it
did
not
apply
retroactively.
that
there
you
had
a
situation
of
a
man
who
have
been
in
jail
was
convicted
then
granted
immunity,
and
he
said
that
he
didn't
have
to
testify
until
he
was
granted
a
pardon
of
what
rejected
that
argument.
we
submit
that
on
the
same
basis,
the
argument
in
this
case
should
be
rejected.
immunity
does
not
have
retroactive
effect
in
his
conviction.
and
the
fact
that
this
man
was
called
and
compelled
to
testify
has
no
effect
on
the
conviction
in
this
case.
i
would
also
like
to
briefly
turn
to
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
search
warrant
which
the
counsel
had
raised.
here
again,
counsel
contend
that
there
was
not
a
probable
cause
for
the
warrant.
now,
here
again
we
assumed
that
this
court
will
sustain
the
use
of
the
recordings
for
--
and
this
court
would
reverse
on
that
ground
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
search
warrant
would
really
become
moot
since
the
petitioner
would
not
be
retried
because
of
the
grant
immunity.
taking
those
factors
into
consideration,
it's
clear
that
the
search
warrant
was
based
on
ample
probable
cause.
it's
set
forth
the
fact
that
the
agents
had
received
reliable
information.
the
petitioner
had
been
using
the
phones
to
make
interstate
calls
that
he
had
been
associated
with
known
gamblers.
the
affidavit
also
stated
that
recordings
have
been
made
in
these
calls
and
that
those
calls
indicated
that
petitioner
was
using
the
telephone
to
place
wages
interstate
and
also
to
get
the
basketball
in
line
to
enable
to
do
that.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
our
position,
mr.
justice
fortas,
yes.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
whether
or
not,
the
immunity
does
go
that
far
is
practical
judgment
then
probably
it
would
not
be
retried.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas
it
is.
i
suppose
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
department
in
view
of
the
immunity
statute
and
the
question,
i
think
it
would
be
a
substantial
question
whether
or
not
he
could
be
retried.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
there
are
not.
but
the
statute
seems
to
us
to
be
drafted
to
preclude
any
--
for
the
trial,
it
seemed
that
at
that
point
it
would
be
subjecting
him
to
a
penalty.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
would
agree
that
that
would
certainly
be
very
questionable.
that's
right,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
the
heart
of
petitioner's
argument
to
a
certain
extent
is
a
radical
change
in
the
concept
to
the
fourth
amendment.
i
think
as
mr.
justice
brennan
mentioned,
it
has
been
said
in
recent
years
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
more
rights
of
privacy
than
rights
in
property.
however
this
court
has
never
held
the
right
of
privacy
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment,
does
not
exist
within
the
framework
of
a
constitutionally
protected
area.
as
counsel
mentioned,
mr.
justice
holmes
speaking
for
unanimous
court,
this
court's
opinion
in
hester
versus
the
united
states,
said
very
clearly,
â€œthe
protections
of
the
fourth
amendment
do
not
extend
to
an
open
field.
to
adapt
the
test
which
counsel
has
suggested
in
this
case
would
radically
change
the
rules
under
which
law
enforcement
has
been
operating
for
a
long
time
with
the
approval
of
this
court,
and
i
mean
it
in
this
sense.
it
seems
to
me
that
to
say
that
no
matter
where
the
activity
takes
place,
it
is
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
the
subjects
to
that
amendment
not
only
the
matter
of
what
is
overheard,
but
what
is
observed.
assume,
if
you
would
please,
the
following
situation.
take
the
case
that
we
have
here.
and
instead
of
the
agents
being
interested
in
hearing
what
mr.
marks
said,
but
let's
assume
it
was
a
kidnapping
case
and
they
knew
that
this
booth
had
been
used
on
one
occasion
too
by
the
kidnapper
to
call
with
regard
to
ransom.
and
the
kidnapper
had
scheduled
to
call
for
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening.
so
as
not
to
scare
him
off,
the
agents
might
station
themselves
in
another
building
some
distance
away,
and
armed
with
binoculars
perhaps
even
in
infrared
scope
that
would
allow
them
to
see
at
night,
put
this
telephone
booth
under
surveillance.
the
kidnapper
would
approach
that
booth.
he
might
look
around
to
make
sure
that
he
was
secured,
that
nobody
was
observing
him.
he
would
be
wrong
in
his
conclusion.
i
assumed
that
under
mr.
mark's
--
mr.
schneider's
rationale
that
the
fact
that
the
agents
saw
him
entered
the
booth,
but
they
could
not
testify
that
that
would
be
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
i
think
that
this
court
has
always
recognized
the
doctrine.
that
one
is
protected
is
the
right
to
privacy
which
exists
within
a
constitutionally
protected
area,
within
a
home,
within
an
office,
some
area
in
which
the
party
involved
has
an
interest.
it
may
not
have
to
be
a
property
interest
of
a
tenant
or
an
owner,
maybe
that
of
a
guest
in
those
premises.
but
it
exists
only
within
the
framework
of
a
constitutionally
protected
area.
we
submit
on
an
analysis
in
that
term
what
occurred
here
did
not
occur
in
a
constitutionally
protected
area.
as
we
see
it,
there
is
no
significant
difference
between
the
telephone
booth
involved
in
this
case
and
an
open
field.
an
occupant
in
a
public
telephone
booth
is
just
as
subject
to
visual
surveillance
as
a
man
standing
in
an
open
field.
these
phone
booths
are
neither
designed
nor
are
they
considered
to
be
totally
sound
proof.
it's
rather
easy
to
overhear
this
i
think
all
of
us
know.
conversation
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
i
don't
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
i
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
i
would
not,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
what
is
taking
place
is
taking
place
in
the
public
area.
seems
to
me
if
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
but
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
the
difference
between
whether
or
not
they
feel
that
they're
being
overheard
or
that
somebody
is
observing
them
from
afar
with
binoculars
is
no
difference.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
it
maybe
that
two
people
meet
to
pass
stolen
goods.
and
they
meet
in
an
abandoned
area
that
they
think
nobody
is
observing.
and
if
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
not
to
the
booth
wall,
certainly
not
to
the
booth
wall,
but
it
is
restricted
to
some
area
in
which
there
is
a
private
interest.
i
think
that
has
been
the
law
today.
that
is
the
law
that
has
been
followed.
i
don't
--
what
i'm
getting
at
most
particularly
is
i
don't
see
drawing
a
distinction
between
overhearing
and
viewing.
and
this
court
has
said
on
the
number
of
occasions
that
it
is
perfectly
proper
to
for
law
enforcement
officials
to
use
means
to
observe
what
is
going
on
in
distant
areas,
to
use
binoculars,
telescopes
that
was
mentioned
mr.
justice
brandeis,
again
running
for
unanimous
court
in
united
states
versus
lee.
i
think
that
this
has
always
been
recognized,
and
i
don't
see
any
rational
basis
withdrawing
the
distinction
between
what
is
being
said
and
what
is
being
done
and
being
observed.
and
we
assumed
that
drawing
on
that
concept,
what
is
involved
here
is
not
an
area.
that
in
which
the
occupant
of
the
booth
gets
any
private
interest,
while
the
booth
might
be
provided
for
his
convenience,
certainly
there
is
no
difference
in
the
rate
he
pays
if
that
booth
and
if
the
phone
is
hung
upon
in
open
wall.
he
takes
no
interest
in
the
premises.
and
we
say
under
these
circumstances,
under
the
rule
in
the
hester
case
and
the
lee
case,
this
is
not
a
constitutional
protected
area.
and
therefore
in
the
circumstance
of
this
case,
there
was
no
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
but
we
suggest
also
that
even
if
this
court
were
to
find,
that
a
public
phone
booth
was
entitled
to
some
degree
or
protection
under
the
fourth
amendment,
that
what
was
done
by
the
agents
in
this
case,
did
meet
the
standards
of
the
fourth
amendment,
when
we're
viewing
the
particular
type
of
premises
involved.
i
would
like
if
might
to
just
go
into
some
of
the
background
of
what
was
done
in
this
case.
early
in
february
of
1965,
the
agents
received
information
from
reliable
informants,
which
led
them
to
believe
that
the
petition
in
this
case,
mr.
katz,
was
using
the
public
phone,
this
particular
public
phone
booth
to
place
wages
in
interstate
by
calling
massachusetts.
on
to
that
information,
they
undertook
surveillance
both
to
katz.
they
found
that
he
was
using
this
particular
booth
which
was
approximately
four
blocks
from
his
hotel.
on
a
regular
basis
at
regular
periods
of
the
day,
having
surveilled
into
this
booth
on
a
number
of
occasions
they
didn't
check
the
telephone
records,
telephone
company.
they
found
that
he
was
calling
the
number
of
a
known
gambler
in
massachusetts.
it
was
only
after
or
they
had
all
of
this
information
that
the
agents
undertook
the
surveillance
in
this
case.
after
they
had
all
of
this
information
they
then
set
up
a
system
involving
a
team
of
five
agents.
the
recorder
was
placed
on
the
top
of
the
phone
booth.
it
had
two
microphones.
one
microphone
was
attached
to
each
of
two
booths.
they
were
taped
on
the
top
of
the
booth.
the
surveilling
agents
were
there
at
the
hotel.
they
would
follow
mr.
katz
as
he
left
his
hotel
and
at
a
point
approximately
one
and
half
blocks
from
the
phone
booth.
when
he
got
to
that
point,
the
surveilling
agents
would
call
and
radio
to
the
agents
at
the
booth,
who
at
that
point
would
go
over
and
activate
the
recorder.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
your
honor,
it's
just
not
clear
in
the
record.
i
assume
that
from
all
the
description
that
it's
found
in
the
record,
it
seems
to
be
just
a
regular
tape
recorder
that
you
would
just
switch
on.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
so
they
waited
until
he
was
coming.
they
activated
the
recorder.
he
came
and
placed
his
calls.
as
soon
as
he
left
the
area,
the
agents
deactivated
the
recorder.
indeed
there
was
one
occasion
where
he
left
the
area,
they
gone
over
and
turned
it
off.
they
got
where
to
he
was
coming
back
again.
they
switch
it
back
on.
but
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
the
area
of
the
phone
booth,
that
tape
recorder
was
turned
off.
the
resembler
was
very
careful
on
this
case
by
the
agents
was
only
one
occasion
this
was
done
for
six
days.
and
only
one
day
did
an
innocent
party
come
in
and
used
that
booth
during
the
period
of
surveillance.
the
agents
testified
with
regard
to
that
conversation
that
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
we
would
assume
--
we
would
say
in
the
first
place
that
it
not
been
a
constitutionally
protected
area,
that
there
is
no
right.
the
fourth
amendment
just
doesn't
apply
to
the
open
field
then
we
say
to
a
public
telephone
booth.
we
say
that
alternatively
if
this
court
feels
that
it
is
should
accord
some
degree
of
protection
for
public
phone
booth,
our
argument
is
basically
that,
well
here,
if
some
degree
of
protection
is
afforded
to
public
phone
booth,
it
is
not
necessarily
the
same
type
of
protection
that
would
be
accorded
to
a
private
home
or
an
office.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
that
is
one
of
our
arguments,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
it
is
our
argument
mr.
justice
fortas.
this
is
not
an
upfront
to
fourth
amendment.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
set
down
any
hard
and
fast
rules.
the
fourth
amendment
sets
up
a
standard
of
reasonableness.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
fortas,
this
is
based
upon
our
alternative
argument.
we
argued
initially
that
a
public
telephone
booth
is
not
a
constitutionally
protected
area.
alternatively,
we
argued
that
even
if
it
were
to
be
considered
by
this
court
to
be
an
area,
entitled
to
some
degree
of
protection
under
the
fourth
amendment.
that
the
fourth
amendment
turns
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
particular
search
involved
was
reasonable.
and
this
court
has
often
said
that
question
of
reasonableness
must
be
determined
upon
the
facts
in
each
case.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
i
do
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
the
fourth
amendment
has
directed
a
conduct
of
law
enforcement
officers.
and
i
think
this
court
can
determine
whether
or
not,
under
the
fourth
amendment
that
conduct
was
reasonable
getting
the
circumstances
that
they
were
viewing,
the
probable
cause
they
had
to
believe
a
crime
was
being
committed,
and
also
taking
all
those
factors
into
consideration.
what
were
the
steps
that
they
took?
did
they
take
a
wholesale
of
shotgun
approach
to
this?
or,
did
they
exercise
--?
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
it
comes
also
from
the
osborn
opinion
where
the
court
said
that
here
we
had
a
discrete
use
of
the
electronic
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
that
they
had
a
reason
to
believe,
he
was
using
this
for
the
specific
purpose
of
committing
the
violation
of
federal
law.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
this
was
not
--
actually
talking
in
these
terms
in
the
brief.
i
would
think
there
was
probable
cause.
they
had
reliable
information
that
he
was
using
the
phone
to
call
known
gamblers.
a
check
of
the
records
of
the
telephone
company
indicated
that
he
was
calling
a
number
of
a
known
gambler
in
massachusetts.
i
think
this
would
amount
to
probable
cause.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
there
are
two
problems
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
we
had
a
probable
cause
to
get
a
search
warrant.
but
i
do
think
that
this
court
has
often
recognized
that
the
probable
cause
is
not
equivalent
to
evidence
of
guilt
beyond
unreasonable
doubt
which
you
had
to
satisfy
a
jury
and
i
don't
think
i
would
want
to
take
this
case
before
the
jury
on
just
what
we
had
at
the
time
the
electronic
surveillance.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
you
could
have
got
the
warrant
for
his
apartment.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
i
think
there
was
still
a
shortage
of
proof
on
the
exact
--
all
of
these,
the
evidence
in
the
apartment
showed
that
he
came
within
that
aspect
of
the
statute
which
requires
that
the
person
is
affected
by
be
engaged
in
the
business
of
gambling.
i
think
that
the
evidence,
the
rundown
chiefs
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
and
i
don't
think
that
we
could
have
done
that,
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
jury
beyond
unreasonable
doubt
with
judge
what
we
had
prior
to
the
electronic
surveillance
and
on
the
basis
of
what
we
see
on
the
arrest
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
certainly
that's
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
for
anybody
who
is
legitimately
on
these
premises,
i
suppose
that
it's
not
a
protected
area
if
he
broke
into
the
office.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
but
if
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
under
this
court's
opinion,
in
the
jones
case,
that
was
indicated
that
you
had
to
be
rightfully
there.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
have
no
right
in
the
premises
at
all
in
which
in
fact
you're
in
acting
interrogation
to
the
rights
of
the
true
owner.
i
think
that
then,
you
would
not
be
accorded
any
protection
in
that
area
whether
that
you
would
be
in
a
public
place.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
most
definitely.
it
is
our
contention
that
that
would
be
then,
but
we're
dealing
with
a
public
phone
booth.
we
are
dealing
with
something
different.
and
it's
our
position
that
even
if
this
court
would
have
said
that
public
phone
booth
wasn't
type
of
some
degree
of
protection
under
the
fourth
amendment,
that
it
is
not
the
same
protection
that
comes
to
a
house.
public
phone
booth
is
more
closely
analogous
we
submit
to
a
public
field
certainly
that
it
is
to
a
home.
and
a
party
in
a
public
phone
booth
has
no
right
to
expect
that
he
is
going
to
be
accorded
all
the
protection
he
would
be
in
a
private
house.
we
submit
that
what
was
done
here
was
not
an
indiscriminate
search
and
seizure
that
such
was
condemned
by
this
court
in
irvine.
it
was
a
very
careful.
it
was
carefully
limited
one
to
only
involving
a
particular
petitioner
in
this
case.
innocent
members
of
the
public
were
not
subject
to
surveillance.
the
only
one
instance
which
has
happened,
the
agents
testified,
that
the
tape
recorder
involved
was
a
stereotype,
had
two
tracks
a
and
b.
they
could
control
which
conversation
they
would
listen
to.
and
they
did
not
in
fact
listen
to
the
conversation
of
the
innocent
party.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
what
i
would
say
that
it
is
under
this
court's
opinion
in
berger,
i
think
the
words
were
seized.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
certainly,
i
think
in
this
case
they
we're
the
actual
means
and
instrumentalities
of
the
crime.
the
crime
is
to
transport
wagering
information
or
wagers
over
the
interstate
facilities,
telephone
facilities.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
the
reason
the
agents
didn't
get
warrant
in
this
particular
case
is
a
very
practical
one.
i
think
the
agents
in
this
case
as
mr.
schneider
said
they've
done
their
homework.
and
they
were
relying
upon
this
court's
decision
of
goldman,
and
felt
that
they
had
complied
with
that,
that
there
was
no
penetration
to
a
constitutional
protected
area.
and
therefore,
it
was
for
that
reason,
they
didn't
seek
warrant.
also
under
rule
41,
there
would
be
some
difficulty.
and
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
either
way,
i
think
it
is
questionable
whether
or
not
you
could
get
a
warrant
for
the
seizure
of
words
in
rule
41
by
its
terms.
to
often
date,
it
says
that
warrant
shall
issue
for
the
seizure
of
property.
and
it
later
defines
property
as
any
books,
records,
documents,
or
other
tangible
property.
so
there
is
a
problem
under
rule
41
as
to
whether
or
not,
you
could
get
a
warrant.
i
do
think
that
the
practical
reason
in
this
case
was
the
agent's
reliance
on
goldman.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
do
think,
mr.
justice
white,
that
this
court
has
said
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
with
two
things,
i
think
constitutionally.
that's
what
we're
talking
about,
were
talking
about
constitutional.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
i
--
i
don't
--
i
think
one
that
that
is
s
you
say
if
you're
talking
just
outside
the
constitutional
framework,
i
certainly
don't
think
the
fact
that
it's
not
included
with
the
federal
rules
raises
a
constitutional
issue.
and
i'm
not
sure
that
in
fact,
it's
not
accorded
to
the
federal
rules
requires
therefore
exclusion.
i
think
that
there
have
been
cases
where
they
said
that
the
fact
of
rule
wasn't
a
requirement.
it
doesn't
necessarily
invalidate
everything
that
was
done.
but
going
pass
that,
i
think
that
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
court's
opinion
even
though
the
rules
now
provide
of
an
inherent
power
where
perhaps
a
search
warrant
could
have
been
obtained.
i
think
this
was
-
you
had
the
same
situation
to
osborn
where
the
court
proved
a
warrant.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
might
be
some
question
under
whether
that
was
in
full
conformity
with
rule
41
because
the
problem
with
the
rule
authorizing
only
the
seizure
property.
so
i
think
there
is
an
--
i
think
historically
there
isn't
basis
or
a
view
that
a
warrant
could
have
issued
as
you
said
under
41,
it
could
not
happened.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
you
could
have
sustain
a
warrant
in
such
that
i
record
upon
to
that
tackled
advise,
i
would
advise
them
to
get
a
warrant
and
let's
litigate
that
issue.
i
think
that
there
is
a
reasonable
argument
that
can
be
made.
the
rule
is
really
not
designed
with
this
inline,
that
it
was
using
the
term
property
as
broad
as
it
built
that
term
was
used
in
campus,
everything
under
the
fourth
amendment.
and
has
been
said,
berger
overrules
the
prior
told
that
words
we're
not
subject
to
seizure.
you
can
reasonably
read
and
the
intent
of
the
drafters
of
the
rule
that
they
would
want
rules
to
cover
anything
subject
to
seizure.
so
i
think
that
there
is
an
argument
that
can
be
made.
it
is
basically
our
position
then
that
even
though
there
was
not
a
warrant
in
this
place,
what
was
done
here
was
reasonable.
this
court
has
indicated
that
far
back
as
carroll
versus
the
united
states,
last
year
in
see
versus
city
of
seattle
that
what
is
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment
may
vary
to
a
certain
extend
upon
the
nature
of
the
premises
that
are
involved,
that
are
subject
to
the
search
and
seizure.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
in
berger
i
don't
believe,
mr.
justice
black
as
i
read
the
court's
opinion
that
was
what
they
were
saying.
i
think
what
they
--
it
was
ultimately
condemned
in
berger
was
the
fact
that
the
warrant
that
issued
was
a
general
warrant
that
allowed
the
police
in
acting
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
what
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
black,
they
did
in
the
berger
case
cite
goldman
and
indicating
that
it
had
some
continuing
validity.
so
i
don't
think
it
all
intended
to
be
as
broad
as
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
but
i
don't
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
can
only
say
that
i
can
agree
with
your
reading
in
the
berger
case,
mr.
justice
black.
as
i
see
it,
what
was
condemned
in
that
case
was
a
situation
where
a
general
warrant
was
used
to
allow
law
enforcement
officers
to
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
the
court
said
that
it
was
a
general
warrant.
it
said
that
what
if
in
any
event
what
the
warrant
did
do
was
authorized
over
a
period
of
60
days,
the
indiscriminate
use
of
an
eavesdropping
device
to
pick
out
everything
that
was
going
on
within
an
office
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
i
think
that's
the
nature
of
the
fourth
amendment,
mr.
justice
black
that
everything
--
the
right
to
a
warrant
is
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
do
think
that
the
fourth
amendment
still
as
construed
by
this
court
carries
with
it
the
concept
of
reasonableness.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
carries
with
it
the
concept
of
judging
the
action
and
determining
whether
that
action
was
reasonable.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
supposed
it's
a
gross
invasion.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
sir
that's
it's
a
gross
invasion
of
privacy.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
it's
reasonable
when
viewed
in
a
light
of
everything
that
has
gone
on.
i
think
it's
a
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
as
to
whether
or
not
what
has
been
done
comports
that
this
stand
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
the
court
has
said
that
eavesdropping
in
all
cases
is
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
it
indicated
in
which
it
certainly
was,
and
that
was
the
berger
case,
that
certainly
in
this
case,
where
you
authorize
people
to
go
in
and
indiscriminately
60
days,
that
that
is
a
violation
to
the
fourth
amendment.
but
i
don't
think
that
it
in
any
sense
precluded
the
question
when
you
have
a
very
discriminate
use.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
in
this
case?
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well
i
will
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
would
point
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
say
it
would
be
reasonable
mr.
justice
black,
if
you
had
strong
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
conversation
that
you
would
overhear
would
relate
to
the
specific
commission
of
a
federal
crime.
and
if
the
action
which
you
took
to
overhear
those
conversations
was
such
is
to
protect
innocent
members
of
the
public
from
having
their
conversations
indiscriminately
overheard,
i
think
that
in
these
conditions
which
are
the
conditions
that
we
have
here,
that
meets
the
reasonableness
standard
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
would
now
like
to
turn,
if
i
may,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
would
say,
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
difference
is
the
right
that
you
have
to
exclude
others
from
the
area
in
which
you're
acting.
certainly
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
he
certainly
has
no
right
to
keep
people
from
standing
right
next
to
him
where
they
could
hear
exactly
what
is
going
on.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
would
not
be
protected
under
the
fourth
amendment.
that's
right.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
because
the
home
is
an
area
in
which
a
man
can
withdraw
and
can
he
so
choses
protect
himself.
and
no
one
has
the
right
to
enter
into
a
man's
home
for
any
purpose.
i
think
that
is
the
difference
between
--
the
man
has
an
interest
in
his
home
which
is
to
be
protected.
and
if
this
was
the
interest
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
drawing
to
protect,
the
man
has
a
right
and
to
say
to
anybody,
you
cannot
come
here
unless
you
can
so
chose
some
justification
under
the
law.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
--
the
office
is
definitely
a
protected
area.
the
question
really
has
been
drawn
then
in
terms
of
standing
and
who
has
standing
to
assert
the
protection
that
that
office
is
afforded.
and
this
court
has
said
that
it
is
not
a
merely
the
owner
who
has
that
standing.
that
is
anyone
in
the
premises
but
it's
the
nature
of
the
premises
again
to
just
protect
it.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
if
he
was
acting
--
if
the
fbi
was
acting
with
the
consent
of
the
person,
your
honor,
this
was
in
the
least
situation.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
then
i
would
think
that
that
would
not
be
protected.that's
right
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
because
the
nature
of
the
fourth
amendment
has
always
been
such.
it's
true
that
it
arises
from
the
right
of
a
person
to
exclude
others
from
a
particular
area
which
is
under
his
control
and
absent
of
that
right
to
exclude
others
there
is
no
right
under
the
fourth
amendment.
i
think
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
designed
to
protect
public
from
trespass
by
law
enforcement
officer
who
was
designed
to
protect
the
individual
in
cases
where
law
enforcement
people
would
break
into
their
homes,
break
into
their
offices,
and
search
generally.
but
the
interest
always
under
the
fourth
amendment
with
some
interest
of
the
individual,
some
area
in
which
he
had
the
right
to
withdraw,
and
to
be
free
from
government
scrutiny.
i
just
--
i
submit
that
that
is
the
distinction
that
has
been
drawn
and
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
even
if
you
assume,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
there
is
some
degree
of
protection
to
be
afforded
to
the
public
telephone,
that
what
was
done
here
was
reasonable
did
protect
whatever
interest
there
is
the
public
might
have
in
the
public
telephone.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
he
withdrew
--
he
went
into
a
booth.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
but
that
was
a
booth
that
was
not
a
soundproof,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
but
i
mean
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
go
into
a
public
phone
booth
you
cannot
--
don't
expect
that
you're
going
to
be
as
protected
in
that
area
as
you
are
in
your
home.
that
it's
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
of
course,
you
don't.
you
do
run
the
risk
of
course
that
you
would
be
overheard
by
people
passing
by,
by
people
on
adjoining
booths.
we
think
that
in
any
event
that
accepting
your
major
premise
that
this
is
entitled
to
some
degree
of
protection.
that
the
protection
of
that
is
entitled
to
is
not
necessarily
have
to
be
made
exactly
coextensive
with
the
protection
would
be
provided
for
home.
then
if
you
provide
that
you
can
only
eavesdrop
in
situations
such
as
this,
where
the
equipment
is
discretely
used,
and
only
when
there
is
ample
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
phone
booth
is
then
and
there
being
used
for
the
condition
of
a
federal
crime.
that
would
legitimately
protect
any
interest
to
be
protected
in
a
public
phone
booth.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
if
in
it
was
such
that
you
could
reasonably
draw
the
conclusion
that
what
we
were
doing
was
not
just
merely
having
this
as
a
convenience
to
what
exclude
some
peripheral
noise.
and
perhaps
there
would
be
a
different
charge
for
using
this
particular
type
of
phone
booth.
then
you
might
conclude
that
the
party
--
it
was
intended
the
party
using
that
booth
receives
some
interest
such
as
brief
though,
may
be
a
least,
but
i
don't
think
they
do
have
that
in
a
normal
public
telephone.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
that
they
put
the
booths
particularly
on
the
street
to
exclude
some
of
the
strenuous
noise
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
that
one,
you
do
now
and
you're
really
having
a
sheet
more
to
the
open
type
of
booth.
i
don't
think
that
the
telephone
company
when
they
put
in,
whether
it'd
be
an
open
booth
or
closed
booth,
things
that
they
are
conferring
greater
or
less
rights
on
the
people
who
are
using
the
phone.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
then
you
might
expect
that
they
--
what
they
are
doing
is
that
they
are
conferring,
they
are
expected
to
find,
building
this
type
of
booth
and
providing
this
type
of
facility.
they
are
providing
something
much
different
than
mere
public
phone
booth
or
the
open
phone.
i
would
like
if
may
now
to
address
myself
to
the
question
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
exactly,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
it
might
be
his
office.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
it
would
certainly
be
a
different
case,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
would
like
to
be
permitted
now
turning
the
question,
we
support
specifically
directed
counsel
in
the
brief
had
argued.
and
that
is
the
quoting
of
frank
v.
united
sates
as
it
affects
this
case.
this
arises
from
the
following
facts,
subsequent
to
the
time
the
petitioner's
appeal
was
affirmed,
he
was
called
before
a
grand
jury
in
the
southern
district
of
florida.
and
pursuant
to
section
409(l)
of
the
communications
act,
he
was
granted
immunity
and
was
questioned
and
in
fact
gave
answers
about
the
telephone
calls
between
the
subject
matter
of
this
indictment.
now,
we
concede
at
the
outset
of
these
questioning
had
taken
place
prior
to
the
trial
of
this
case.
the
petitioner
could
not
have
been
tried
that
he
would
have
had
immunity
from
prosecution.
we
would
consider
also
that
if
this
court
would
adopt
the
holding
in
frank
v.united
states,
the
conviction
would
have
to
be
vacated.
it
is
our
position
that
frank
v.
united
states
was
incorrectly
decided.
neither
the
circuit
court
in
frank
nor
petitioner
in
their
brief
in
this
court
has
suggested
any
reason
from
either
the
legislative
history,
the
communications
act
immunity
section
or
in
the
fourth
amendment
why
the
privilege
conferred
by
the
immunity
statute
must
be
immunity
conferred,
must
be
viewed
to
be
retroactive.
this
court
has
expressly
rejected
that
concept
in
the
case
of
reina
v.
united
states
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
if
there
was
a
retrial
in
this
case?
if
--
assuming
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
we
will
not
be
tried.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
that
is
correct.
we
would
not
take
the
decision
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
and
i
think
in
the
future
he
has
immunity.
but
from
anything
in
the
past,
he
stands
convicted.
and
there
is
no
reason
to
apply
that
immunity
retroactively,
that's
our
position.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
it
says
penalty
--
we
submit
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
indicate
that
the
denial,
the
grant
or
denial
relieved
by
this
court
could
be
considered
a
penalty
under
the
act.
and
when
it
talked
of
penalty,
it
talked
in
terms
of
any
future
prosecution
or
future
use
of
the
evidence
obtained
that
might
violate
his
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment.
but
this
court
specifically
held
in
the
reina
case,
that
it
did
not
apply
retroactively.
that
there
you
had
a
situation
of
a
man
who
have
been
in
jail
was
convicted
then
granted
immunity,
and
he
said
that
he
didn't
have
to
testify
until
he
was
granted
a
pardon
of
what
rejected
that
argument.
we
submit
that
on
the
same
basis,
the
argument
in
this
case
should
be
rejected.
immunity
does
not
have
retroactive
effect
in
his
conviction.
and
the
fact
that
this
man
was
called
and
compelled
to
testify
has
no
effect
on
the
conviction
in
this
case.
i
would
also
like
to
briefly
turn
to
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
search
warrant
which
the
counsel
had
raised.
here
again,
counsel
contend
that
there
was
not
a
probable
cause
for
the
warrant.
now,
here
again
we
assumed
that
this
court
will
sustain
the
use
of
the
recordings
for
--
and
this
court
would
reverse
on
that
ground
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
search
warrant
would
really
become
moot
since
the
petitioner
would
not
be
retried
because
of
the
grant
immunity.
taking
those
factors
into
consideration,
it's
clear
that
the
search
warrant
was
based
on
ample
probable
cause.
it's
set
forth
the
fact
that
the
agents
had
received
reliable
information.
the
petitioner
had
been
using
the
phones
to
make
interstate
calls
that
he
had
been
associated
with
known
gamblers.
the
affidavit
also
stated
that
recordings
have
been
made
in
these
calls
and
that
those
calls
indicated
that
petitioner
was
using
the
telephone
to
place
wages
interstate
and
also
to
get
the
basketball
in
line
to
enable
to
do
that.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
our
position,
mr.
justice
fortas,
yes.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
whether
or
not,
the
immunity
does
go
that
far
is
practical
judgment
then
probably
it
would
not
be
retried.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas
it
is.
i
suppose
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
department
in
view
of
the
immunity
statute
and
the
question,
i
think
it
would
be
a
substantial
question
whether
or
not
he
could
be
retried.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
there
are
not.
but
the
statute
seems
to
us
to
be
drafted
to
preclude
any
--
for
the
trial,
it
seemed
that
at
that
point
it
would
be
subjecting
him
to
a
penalty.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
would
agree
that
that
would
certainly
be
very
questionable.
that's
right,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
