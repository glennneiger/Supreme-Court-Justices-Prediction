mr.
burton
marks
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
the
argument
of
the
solicitor
general
that
the
area
is
what
we're
concerned
with
seems
to
be
an
anachronism
just
as
the
laws
of
trespass
of
this
--
at
the
property
laws
which
were
conceived
hundreds
of
years
ago
in
the
common
law
are
anachronistic.
a
good
example
might
be
the
old
concept
of
common
law
of
property
that
the
man
owned
his
property
from
the
middle
of
the
earth
of
this
as
high
as
the
sky.
and
we
know
now
that
there
is
no
trespass
when
an
airplane
flies
over
a
man's
land
at
least
so
long
as
it
doesn't
interfere
with
it.
so
the
rules
and
laws
of
trespass
have
changed
as
science
has
advanced
the
concept
of
how
you
can
invade
the
privacy
of
a
person.
now,
it
is
our
suggestion
that
taking
the
reasonable
search
proposition
of
the
fourth
amendment,
reading
berger
as
we
think
it
is
read
that
there
can
be
searches
and
seizures
under
properly
controlled
circumstances
of
anything
--
mr.
burton
marks
well,
as
i
understand
berger
they
said
that
the
proper
control
was
discrimination
as
to
what
you
are
looking
for,
the
time
that
you're
going
to
look
for
it,
who
is
going
to
be
involved,
and
what
specific
subject
matter
you
are
looking
for.
mr.
burton
marks
i
can
--
that
is
exactly
right
assuming
that
section
605
of
title
48
--
mr.
burton
marks
in
the
absence
of
the
statute
which
does
bar
a
telephonic
eavesdropping,
i
would
say
that
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
berger
case
as
it
construed
it
does
not
prohibit
reasonably
but
extremely
discriminate
searches
of
that
type.
and
i
know
that
--
mr.
burton
marks
no
that
--
mr.
burton
marks
i
think
that
that
has
to
be
a
matter
assuming
that
i'm
correct
in
this
court.
and
i
sincerely
believed
that
the
court
held
--
the
majority
in
berger
held
that
they
will
uphold
reason
--
will
uphold
statutes
which
are
finely
and
narrowly
drawn
as
being
within
the
framework
of
the
fourth
amendment,
then
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
crime
is
assuming
that
--
and
some
of
the
justices
state
that
that
should
be
a
matter
of
experimentation
let
up
to
the
legislature.
i
just
noted
with
interest
before
i
left
los
angeles,
they
come
here,
i
received
a
notice
in
the
--
a
press
release
that
senator
long's
bill
for
instance
had
gone
into
the
senate
judiciary
committee.
and
that
bill
provided
for
wire
--
absolutely
no
wiretapping
except
in
national
security.
there
are
numerous
other
bills
and
other
legislature
which
want
to
allow
law
enforcements
such
as
in
the
crime
commission
study
to
investigate
the
fact
of
any
crime.
i
have
a
personal
feeling
as
to
what
i
want
and
what
i
would
like
to
see
but
that
has
no
bearing
on
what
i
think
this
court
has
said
with
respect
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
search.
and
with
respect
to
that
also,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
osborn
case,
a
search
warrant
was
in
fact
issued
notwithstanding
what
you
might
have
called
the
procedures
that
the
judges
instituted
to
put
a
bug
on
the
man
to
go
and
listen
to
the
lawyer's
conversation.
because
what
happened
was
if
there
was
an
affidavit
based
on
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
specific
crime
had
been
committed
and
they're
after
an
order
by
the
court.
and
you
could
call
it
what
you
want
but
it
seems
to
me
it
was
a
search
warrant
that
was
issued
by
the
court
to
hear
specific
conversation
by
the
eavesdropper.
and
that,
you
can
call
it
an
authorization
but
it
seems
to
me
that
without
a
question,
there
was
a
search
warrant
in
osborn.
in
the
instant
case,
if
you
want
to
turn
it
on
search
warrant
probably
there
was
ample
probable
cause
in
my
opinion
for
the
fbi
who
as
my
brother,
mr.
schneider
said
did
their
homework,
and
i
don't
think
they
did
it
enough.
they
had
the
following
information
before
they
put
the
bug
in
the
phone,
that
mr.
katz
was
making
phone
calls.
they
knew
that
he
was
making
phone
calls
to
person
they
suspected
to
be
a
bookmaker.
they
also
had
information
from
a
confidential
informant
that
mr.
katz
was
using
the
phone
to
make
wagers,
not
only
that
but
they
had
information
that
mr.
katz
was
going
at
specific
times
of
the
day
to
a
specific
area
to
make
these
phone
calls.
now,
based
on
that
proposition,
would
it
not
have
been
very
simple
to
go
down
to
court
and
ask
for
a
search
warrant
to
--
and
set
out
how
they
were
going
to
do
it.
and
every
time
mr.
katz
came
into
the
telephone
booth
that
they
were
going
to
make
the
--
turn
the
recorder.
mr.
burton
marks
i
think
that
that
but
there's
no
question
they
might
at
that
way.
mr.
burton
marks
yes.
i
don't
--
mr.
burton
marks
yes.
mr.
burton
marks
correct.
mr.
burton
marks
that
is
my
opinion
for
that
--
that's
exactly
what
the
berger
case
says.
and
again,
i
say
i
restricted
to
what
the
court
says
not
with
my
own
personal
opinion
of
what
should
be
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
burton
marks
for
an
arrest,
at
the
time
that
they
bug
the
phone
booth.
mr.
burton
marks
probably
cause
for
the
issuance
of
a
search
warrant
to
obtain
mere
evidence
which
this
court
has
held
as
permissible
under
a
search
warrant.
they
had,
in
other
words,
at
this
point
the
court
has
put
us
at
least
i
think
in
a
position
where
at
the
search
for
evidence
alone
is
admissible,
then
the
search
warrant
could
have
issued
for
that.
on
the
other
hand,
if
a
conversation
that
that
is
in
fact
the
crime
itself,
then
you're
picking
up
evidence
of
the
crime,
the
commission
of
the
crime
as
much
as
you
might
be
picking
up
the
loot
that
a
robber
has
picked
up
or
the
tools
that
he
used
in
the
commission
of
a
robbery
or
a
murder.
mr.
burton
marks
they
had
a
confidential
informant
that
they
stated
and
informed
them
that
he
was
making
bets
when
we
went
into
the
telephone
booth,
and
that
he
was
wagering
for
others,
and
then
placing
bets
for
others.
and
to
corroborate
this,
they
had
already
seen
the
telephone
company
records
which
indicated
where
the
calls
have
been
placed
to.
and
from
previous
information,
they
knew
or
thought
they
knew
that
the
calls
placed
were
to
a
bookmaker
or
a
known
bookmaker.
and
if
that
were
the
case,
i
would
say
that
there'd
be
no
question
in
my
mind
that
that
would
be
sufficient
probable
cause
to
institute
a
search
for
a
crime
which
was
being
committed.
although
absent
knowing
what
the
conversations
were,
i
don't
think
that
they
would
have
probable
cause
for
arrest.
once
they
determine
--
mr.
burton
marks
yes.
mr.
burton
marks
absolutely,
but
it
would
have
to
be
very
discriminate
as
--
as
i
say
the
other
bit
of
information
they
had
was,
katz's
constant
and
consistent
daily
activity
of
going
into
this
particular
booth
at
a
particular
time.
mr.
burton
marks
conceding
--
oh,
the
fact
that
they
didn't
obtained
a
search
warrant.
mr.
burton
marks
no,
that
is
not
the
whole
case.
the
second
proposition
is
that
absent
of
search
warrant,
they
have
no
right
to
invade
a
constitutionally
protected
area
which
area
is
defined
by
the
person
and
not
by
some
rule
of
law
which
says
that
there
has
to
be
an
area
which
is
protected
--
mr.
burton
marks
if
it
was
reasonable.
mr.
burton
marks
right.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
i
would
say
this;
i
enforce
the
conclusion
from
berger
that
this
is
a
search
warrant
case
without
question.
mr.
burton
marks
no,
but
the
difference
between
binoculars
and
hearings
i
think
is
a
very
simple
thing.
that
again,
it's
the
test
of
reason.
you
can
know
that
you
are
being
seen
or
at
least
reasonably
suspect
that
you
maybe
spied
on
easier
than
you
can
suspect
that
you're
being
listened
to
by
distant
methods.
and
there's
no
way
to
--
if
you
want
to
avoid
being
seen,
then
you
go
into
an
area
where
no
one
can
see
you
hopefully.
and
that
would
seem
to
be
an
inside
room
--
mr.
burton
marks
right,
if
they're
going
to
resort
to
fluoroscopy
to
get
to
what
somebody
is
doing
inside,
then
i
would
say
that
our
test
as
far
as
invasion
of
privacy
would
apply
equally
well
where
the
person
has
intended
not
to
be
seen,
and
could
be
reasonably
seen
that
under
no
circumstances
except
by
the
use
of
other
devices
unknown
to
the
person
could
the
police
have
gotten
there
and
that
might
--
mr.
burton
marks
that's
right
but
they're
--
they
unfortunately
there
have
been
such
as
in
the
hester
case.
and
again
the
hester
case
might
go
upon
that
premise.
although
again,
i
think
with
all
due
respect
that
justice
holmes
made
an
ipsy-dipsy
statement
about
the
feel
of
not
being
a
constitutionally
protected
area
because
from
what
i
understand
the
case
now
was
very
sparse.
there
was
in
fact
a
physical
trespass
on
the
land
of
another
by
the
agents
which
might
not
have
been
warned
and
that
might
have
invalidated
the
entire
search
such
as
in
the
hurst
case
which
was
a
little
bit
later.
and
as
i
say,
it's
quite
an
old
case.
and
the
changes
and
the
thoughts
of
what
were
constitutionally
protected
areas
have
made
quite
a
few
strides
since
then.
now,
with
respect
somewhat
to
this
frank
case
problem,
it's
a
very
unusual
situation
that
has
occurred
here
and
probably
the
reason
that
there
have
been
no
cases
before
involving
mr.
katz's
particular
situation
is
that
it
doesn't
happen
very
often,
although
if
the
court
wouldn't
allow
it
to
happen,
it
might
happen
consistently
more
and
more.
and
that
is
as
follows.
mr.
katz
had,
before
he
went
to
trial,
an
absolute
right
not
to
testify
against
himself,
not
to
be
compelled
to
make
any
testimony.
the
government
didn't
deem
it
necessary
to
have
his
testimony
in
order
to
secure
whatever
investigation
they
wanted.
and
they
decided
to
put
him
on
trial
and
they
convicted
him.
now,
after
he
was
--
mr.
burton
marks
pardon
me?
mr.
burton
marks
that
they
secured
from
his
lips?
mr.
burton
marks
well,
they
convicted
him
without
the
subsequent
testimony
which
was
before
the
grand
jury.
i
don't
know
exactly
what
he
testified
to
in
the
grand
jury
since
that
was
private.
but
the
interesting
point
is
this.
that
after
mr.
katz
had
been
convicted
and
while
he
was
contesting
his
conviction,
the
grand
jury
wanted
to
question
him
about
matters
which
involved
what
he
was
--
the
conviction
that
he
was
appealing
from.
and
in
order
to
compel
this
testimony,
the
court
below
on
the
first
go
around
put
mr.
katz
in
jail.
and
he
spent
90
days
in
jail
somewhat
until
the
first
grand
jury
had
expired
protecting
his
right
not
to
have
to
testify
even
though
when
there
was
a
grant
of
immunity.
now,
we
go
to
the
second
proposition
that
the
government
says
we
granted
him
immunity
and
now
he
decided
to
testify
because
he
didn't
want
to
go
to
jail
again,
which
is
a
type
of
compulsion
that
i
think
is
the
greatest
of
all
to
get
a
man
to
testify.
now,
they
say,
“we've
used
whatever
compulsion
we
can.
we
forced
him
into
a
position
where
he
has
to
testify
or
stay
in
jail
and
nevertheless
if
its
conviction
isn't
reversed,
we
still
have
the
benefits
of
the
conviction.
we
still
have
the
benefits
whatever
that
maybe
to
the
unites
states
government
of
$300.
and
we've
got
some
additional
evidence
to
go
out
and
get
somebody
else.”
now,
whether
or
not
this
court
has
rejected
the
quid
pro
quo
argument,
there
seems
to
be
something
basically
unfair
about
compelling
a
man
to
testify
when
he
doesn't
want
to
testify,
unless
you
give
him
something
for
it.
and
that's
why
i
think
the
reina
case
may
not
be
proper
as
a
matter
of
due
process
of
law,
whatever
we
want
to
call
it,
fairness
between
the
government
and
that
the
individual
who
is
being
subjected
to
penalties.
i
think
therefore
that
the
frank
case
should
be
upheld.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
reina
was
a
different
situation
because
mr.
reina
could
have
said
being
in
jail,
“i
don't
want
to
testify,”
and
there
was
no
compulsion
whatsoever
that
the
court
could
give
him
to
force
him
to
testify
because
it's
all
the
court
could
say
is
go
to
jail
and
he
could
say,
i'm
in
jail.
so
you
can't
do
anything
to
me
because
i
don't
know
these
particular
circumstances.
he
was
trying
to
strike
a
bargain.
and
i
think
he
might
have
done
a
little
bit
more
table
finding
he
might
have
got
a
part
of
the
bargain
that
he
wanted
but
i
don't
think
you
have
to
overrule
the
entire
case
because
the
situation
is
different
for
the
person
in
jail
and
out
of
jail.
and
it
depends
on
what
compulsion
the
government
can
use
against
the
person
in
order
to
determine
what
benefits
he
is
to
get
from
the
testimony
which
otherwise
would
not
have
to
give
unless
there
was
this
immunity
statute,
which
is
interposed
between
it.
with
respect
to
the
warrants,
i
concur
with
my
brother,
mr.
schneider.
i
don't
know
what
the
fruits
and
instrumentalities
of
the
crime
are.
i
know
what
they
usually
are.
i
know
how
far
the
courts
have
extended
to
say
that
there
is
--
certain
objects
are
fruits
and
instrumentalities
of
a
particular
crime.
i
know
that
now
that
the
court
has
said
that
there
may
be
a
search
for
mere
evidence
that
the
discretion
of
the
officer
as
to
what
is
evidence
is
going
to
be
so
broad
as
to
make
every
search
warrant,
in
my
opinion,
a
general
search
warrant.
in
the
instant
case,
the
best
that
can
be
said
for
instance
about
mr.
katz's
yellow
sheets
of
paper
that
have
the
basketball
scores
on
them
was
that
there
were
some
evidence
of
the
fact
that
he
might
have
been
in
the
business
of
wagering.
and
therefore
the
warrant
that
issued
was
in
that
sense
a
general
warrant
and
a
search
for
mere
evidence,
and
not
a
search
for
the
instrumentalities
of
the
crime
because
he
didn't
need
those
papers
to
make
a
bet
or
to
make
a
wager.
they
helped
them
at
some
time
but
they
weren't
instrumentalities
of
the
crime
of
transmitting
the
wager
for
the
gambling
information.
mr.
burton
marks
to
compute
the
line
--
mr.
burton
marks
to
get
the
line,
the
daily
line.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
he,
mr.
katz
maybe
off
the
record
a
little
bit
that
he's
one
of
the
best
handicappers
in
the
country.
mr.
burton
marks
one
of
the
best
handicappers
in
the
country
on
basketball
games.
he's
kept
these
--
the
records
of
basketball
teams
for
30
years,
that's
what
these
things
were.
and
he
has
device
his
own
system
for
determining
how
good
the
team
would
be
from
what
the
record
was
of
each
team
playing
against
another
team
over
the
period
of
years.
now,
that
may
have
helped
him
in
making
a
determination
of
what
kind
of
wager
he
was
going
to
make.
mr.
burton
marks
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
we
have
to
do
is
to
go
out
and
have
the
evidence
once
it
was
submitted,
go
in
and
get
his
photo
so
that
he
could
get
copies
of
what
he's
(voice
overlap).
mr.
burton
marks
finally,
i
might
say
this
and
this
is
a
test
that
i
think
the
court
can
take
it's
own
judicial
notice
if
we
took
the
test
and
of
course
again,
it's
outside
of
the
record
but
the
attorney
general,
that's
the
solicitor
general
submitted
it
somewhat
on
his
own
that
you
can
overhear
a
conversation
from
an
adjoining
phone
booth.
i
submit
that
if
the
court
wants
to
make
a
test,
go
and
sit
in
some
phone
booth,
the
one
at
the
sunset
boulevard,
it's
the
ordinary
type
with
a
little
glass
door.
just
sit
in
it
and
listen
next
door
and
see
if
you
can
hear
a
person
and
determine
what
he
is
saying
in
an
ordinary
conversational
voice.
i
submit
that
you
cannot
so
hear
and
that
there
was
intended
to
give
privacy
and
this
right
of
privacy
of
the
individual
should
be
respected.
thank
you.
mr.
burton
marks
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
the
argument
of
the
solicitor
general
that
the
area
is
what
we're
concerned
with
seems
to
be
an
anachronism
just
as
the
laws
of
trespass
of
this
--
at
the
property
laws
which
were
conceived
hundreds
of
years
ago
in
the
common
law
are
anachronistic.
a
good
example
might
be
the
old
concept
of
common
law
of
property
that
the
man
owned
his
property
from
the
middle
of
the
earth
of
this
as
high
as
the
sky.
and
we
know
now
that
there
is
no
trespass
when
an
airplane
flies
over
a
man's
land
at
least
so
long
as
it
doesn't
interfere
with
it.
so
the
rules
and
laws
of
trespass
have
changed
as
science
has
advanced
the
concept
of
how
you
can
invade
the
privacy
of
a
person.
now,
it
is
our
suggestion
that
taking
the
reasonable
search
proposition
of
the
fourth
amendment,
reading
berger
as
we
think
it
is
read
that
there
can
be
searches
and
seizures
under
properly
controlled
circumstances
of
anything
--
mr.
burton
marks
well,
as
i
understand
berger
they
said
that
the
proper
control
was
discrimination
as
to
what
you
are
looking
for,
the
time
that
you're
going
to
look
for
it,
who
is
going
to
be
involved,
and
what
specific
subject
matter
you
are
looking
for.
mr.
burton
marks
i
can
--
that
is
exactly
right
assuming
that
section
605
of
title
48
--
mr.
burton
marks
in
the
absence
of
the
statute
which
does
bar
a
telephonic
eavesdropping,
i
would
say
that
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
berger
case
as
it
construed
it
does
not
prohibit
reasonably
but
extremely
discriminate
searches
of
that
type.
and
i
know
that
--
mr.
burton
marks
no
that
--
mr.
burton
marks
i
think
that
that
has
to
be
a
matter
assuming
that
i'm
correct
in
this
court.
and
i
sincerely
believed
that
the
court
held
--
the
majority
in
berger
held
that
they
will
uphold
reason
--
will
uphold
statutes
which
are
finely
and
narrowly
drawn
as
being
within
the
framework
of
the
fourth
amendment,
then
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
crime
is
assuming
that
--
and
some
of
the
justices
state
that
that
should
be
a
matter
of
experimentation
let
up
to
the
legislature.
i
just
noted
with
interest
before
i
left
los
angeles,
they
come
here,
i
received
a
notice
in
the
--
a
press
release
that
senator
long's
bill
for
instance
had
gone
into
the
senate
judiciary
committee.
and
that
bill
provided
for
wire
--
absolutely
no
wiretapping
except
in
national
security.
there
are
numerous
other
bills
and
other
legislature
which
want
to
allow
law
enforcements
such
as
in
the
crime
commission
study
to
investigate
the
fact
of
any
crime.
i
have
a
personal
feeling
as
to
what
i
want
and
what
i
would
like
to
see
but
that
has
no
bearing
on
what
i
think
this
court
has
said
with
respect
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
search.
and
with
respect
to
that
also,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
osborn
case,
a
search
warrant
was
in
fact
issued
notwithstanding
what
you
might
have
called
the
procedures
that
the
judges
instituted
to
put
a
bug
on
the
man
to
go
and
listen
to
the
lawyer's
conversation.
because
what
happened
was
if
there
was
an
affidavit
based
on
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
specific
crime
had
been
committed
and
they're
after
an
order
by
the
court.
and
you
could
call
it
what
you
want
but
it
seems
to
me
it
was
a
search
warrant
that
was
issued
by
the
court
to
hear
specific
conversation
by
the
eavesdropper.
and
that,
you
can
call
it
an
authorization
but
it
seems
to
me
that
without
a
question,
there
was
a
search
warrant
in
osborn.
in
the
instant
case,
if
you
want
to
turn
it
on
search
warrant
probably
there
was
ample
probable
cause
in
my
opinion
for
the
fbi
who
as
my
brother,
mr.
schneider
said
did
their
homework,
and
i
don't
think
they
did
it
enough.
they
had
the
following
information
before
they
put
the
bug
in
the
phone,
that
mr.
katz
was
making
phone
calls.
they
knew
that
he
was
making
phone
calls
to
person
they
suspected
to
be
a
bookmaker.
they
also
had
information
from
a
confidential
informant
that
mr.
katz
was
using
the
phone
to
make
wagers,
not
only
that
but
they
had
information
that
mr.
katz
was
going
at
specific
times
of
the
day
to
a
specific
area
to
make
these
phone
calls.
now,
based
on
that
proposition,
would
it
not
have
been
very
simple
to
go
down
to
court
and
ask
for
a
search
warrant
to
--
and
set
out
how
they
were
going
to
do
it.
and
every
time
mr.
katz
came
into
the
telephone
booth
that
they
were
going
to
make
the
--
turn
the
recorder.
mr.
burton
marks
i
think
that
that
but
there's
no
question
they
might
at
that
way.
mr.
burton
marks
yes.
i
don't
--
mr.
burton
marks
yes.
mr.
burton
marks
correct.
mr.
burton
marks
that
is
my
opinion
for
that
--
that's
exactly
what
the
berger
case
says.
and
again,
i
say
i
restricted
to
what
the
court
says
not
with
my
own
personal
opinion
of
what
should
be
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
burton
marks
for
an
arrest,
at
the
time
that
they
bug
the
phone
booth.
mr.
burton
marks
probably
cause
for
the
issuance
of
a
search
warrant
to
obtain
mere
evidence
which
this
court
has
held
as
permissible
under
a
search
warrant.
they
had,
in
other
words,
at
this
point
the
court
has
put
us
at
least
i
think
in
a
position
where
at
the
search
for
evidence
alone
is
admissible,
then
the
search
warrant
could
have
issued
for
that.
on
the
other
hand,
if
a
conversation
that
that
is
in
fact
the
crime
itself,
then
you're
picking
up
evidence
of
the
crime,
the
commission
of
the
crime
as
much
as
you
might
be
picking
up
the
loot
that
a
robber
has
picked
up
or
the
tools
that
he
used
in
the
commission
of
a
robbery
or
a
murder.
mr.
burton
marks
they
had
a
confidential
informant
that
they
stated
and
informed
them
that
he
was
making
bets
when
we
went
into
the
telephone
booth,
and
that
he
was
wagering
for
others,
and
then
placing
bets
for
others.
and
to
corroborate
this,
they
had
already
seen
the
telephone
company
records
which
indicated
where
the
calls
have
been
placed
to.
and
from
previous
information,
they
knew
or
thought
they
knew
that
the
calls
placed
were
to
a
bookmaker
or
a
known
bookmaker.
and
if
that
were
the
case,
i
would
say
that
there'd
be
no
question
in
my
mind
that
that
would
be
sufficient
probable
cause
to
institute
a
search
for
a
crime
which
was
being
committed.
although
absent
knowing
what
the
conversations
were,
i
don't
think
that
they
would
have
probable
cause
for
arrest.
once
they
determine
--
mr.
burton
marks
yes.
mr.
burton
marks
absolutely,
but
it
would
have
to
be
very
discriminate
as
--
as
i
say
the
other
bit
of
information
they
had
was,
katz's
constant
and
consistent
daily
activity
of
going
into
this
particular
booth
at
a
particular
time.
mr.
burton
marks
conceding
--
oh,
the
fact
that
they
didn't
obtained
a
search
warrant.
mr.
burton
marks
no,
that
is
not
the
whole
case.
the
second
proposition
is
that
absent
of
search
warrant,
they
have
no
right
to
invade
a
constitutionally
protected
area
which
area
is
defined
by
the
person
and
not
by
some
rule
of
law
which
says
that
there
has
to
be
an
area
which
is
protected
--
mr.
burton
marks
if
it
was
reasonable.
mr.
burton
marks
right.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
i
would
say
this;
i
enforce
the
conclusion
from
berger
that
this
is
a
search
warrant
case
without
question.
mr.
burton
marks
no,
but
the
difference
between
binoculars
and
hearings
i
think
is
a
very
simple
thing.
that
again,
it's
the
test
of
reason.
you
can
know
that
you
are
being
seen
or
at
least
reasonably
suspect
that
you
maybe
spied
on
easier
than
you
can
suspect
that
you're
being
listened
to
by
distant
methods.
and
there's
no
way
to
--
if
you
want
to
avoid
being
seen,
then
you
go
into
an
area
where
no
one
can
see
you
hopefully.
and
that
would
seem
to
be
an
inside
room
--
mr.
burton
marks
right,
if
they're
going
to
resort
to
fluoroscopy
to
get
to
what
somebody
is
doing
inside,
then
i
would
say
that
our
test
as
far
as
invasion
of
privacy
would
apply
equally
well
where
the
person
has
intended
not
to
be
seen,
and
could
be
reasonably
seen
that
under
no
circumstances
except
by
the
use
of
other
devices
unknown
to
the
person
could
the
police
have
gotten
there
and
that
might
--
mr.
burton
marks
that's
right
but
they're
--
they
unfortunately
there
have
been
such
as
in
the
hester
case.
and
again
the
hester
case
might
go
upon
that
premise.
although
again,
i
think
with
all
due
respect
that
justice
holmes
made
an
ipsy-dipsy
statement
about
the
feel
of
not
being
a
constitutionally
protected
area
because
from
what
i
understand
the
case
now
was
very
sparse.
there
was
in
fact
a
physical
trespass
on
the
land
of
another
by
the
agents
which
might
not
have
been
warned
and
that
might
have
invalidated
the
entire
search
such
as
in
the
hurst
case
which
was
a
little
bit
later.
and
as
i
say,
it's
quite
an
old
case.
and
the
changes
and
the
thoughts
of
what
were
constitutionally
protected
areas
have
made
quite
a
few
strides
since
then.
now,
with
respect
somewhat
to
this
frank
case
problem,
it's
a
very
unusual
situation
that
has
occurred
here
and
probably
the
reason
that
there
have
been
no
cases
before
involving
mr.
katz's
particular
situation
is
that
it
doesn't
happen
very
often,
although
if
the
court
wouldn't
allow
it
to
happen,
it
might
happen
consistently
more
and
more.
and
that
is
as
follows.
mr.
katz
had,
before
he
went
to
trial,
an
absolute
right
not
to
testify
against
himself,
not
to
be
compelled
to
make
any
testimony.
the
government
didn't
deem
it
necessary
to
have
his
testimony
in
order
to
secure
whatever
investigation
they
wanted.
and
they
decided
to
put
him
on
trial
and
they
convicted
him.
now,
after
he
was
--
mr.
burton
marks
pardon
me?
mr.
burton
marks
that
they
secured
from
his
lips?
mr.
burton
marks
well,
they
convicted
him
without
the
subsequent
testimony
which
was
before
the
grand
jury.
i
don't
know
exactly
what
he
testified
to
in
the
grand
jury
since
that
was
private.
but
the
interesting
point
is
this.
that
after
mr.
katz
had
been
convicted
and
while
he
was
contesting
his
conviction,
the
grand
jury
wanted
to
question
him
about
matters
which
involved
what
he
was
--
the
conviction
that
he
was
appealing
from.
and
in
order
to
compel
this
testimony,
the
court
below
on
the
first
go
around
put
mr.
katz
in
jail.
and
he
spent
90
days
in
jail
somewhat
until
the
first
grand
jury
had
expired
protecting
his
right
not
to
have
to
testify
even
though
when
there
was
a
grant
of
immunity.
now,
we
go
to
the
second
proposition
that
the
government
says
we
granted
him
immunity
and
now
he
decided
to
testify
because
he
didn't
want
to
go
to
jail
again,
which
is
a
type
of
compulsion
that
i
think
is
the
greatest
of
all
to
get
a
man
to
testify.
now,
they
say,
“we've
used
whatever
compulsion
we
can.
we
forced
him
into
a
position
where
he
has
to
testify
or
stay
in
jail
and
nevertheless
if
its
conviction
isn't
reversed,
we
still
have
the
benefits
of
the
conviction.
we
still
have
the
benefits
whatever
that
maybe
to
the
unites
states
government
of
$300.
and
we've
got
some
additional
evidence
to
go
out
and
get
somebody
else.”
now,
whether
or
not
this
court
has
rejected
the
quid
pro
quo
argument,
there
seems
to
be
something
basically
unfair
about
compelling
a
man
to
testify
when
he
doesn't
want
to
testify,
unless
you
give
him
something
for
it.
and
that's
why
i
think
the
reina
case
may
not
be
proper
as
a
matter
of
due
process
of
law,
whatever
we
want
to
call
it,
fairness
between
the
government
and
that
the
individual
who
is
being
subjected
to
penalties.
i
think
therefore
that
the
frank
case
should
be
upheld.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
reina
was
a
different
situation
because
mr.
reina
could
have
said
being
in
jail,
“i
don't
want
to
testify,”
and
there
was
no
compulsion
whatsoever
that
the
court
could
give
him
to
force
him
to
testify
because
it's
all
the
court
could
say
is
go
to
jail
and
he
could
say,
i'm
in
jail.
so
you
can't
do
anything
to
me
because
i
don't
know
these
particular
circumstances.
he
was
trying
to
strike
a
bargain.
and
i
think
he
might
have
done
a
little
bit
more
table
finding
he
might
have
got
a
part
of
the
bargain
that
he
wanted
but
i
don't
think
you
have
to
overrule
the
entire
case
because
the
situation
is
different
for
the
person
in
jail
and
out
of
jail.
and
it
depends
on
what
compulsion
the
government
can
use
against
the
person
in
order
to
determine
what
benefits
he
is
to
get
from
the
testimony
which
otherwise
would
not
have
to
give
unless
there
was
this
immunity
statute,
which
is
interposed
between
it.
with
respect
to
the
warrants,
i
concur
with
my
brother,
mr.
schneider.
i
don't
know
what
the
fruits
and
instrumentalities
of
the
crime
are.
i
know
what
they
usually
are.
i
know
how
far
the
courts
have
extended
to
say
that
there
is
--
certain
objects
are
fruits
and
instrumentalities
of
a
particular
crime.
i
know
that
now
that
the
court
has
said
that
there
may
be
a
search
for
mere
evidence
that
the
discretion
of
the
officer
as
to
what
is
evidence
is
going
to
be
so
broad
as
to
make
every
search
warrant,
in
my
opinion,
a
general
search
warrant.
in
the
instant
case,
the
best
that
can
be
said
for
instance
about
mr.
katz's
yellow
sheets
of
paper
that
have
the
basketball
scores
on
them
was
that
there
were
some
evidence
of
the
fact
that
he
might
have
been
in
the
business
of
wagering.
and
therefore
the
warrant
that
issued
was
in
that
sense
a
general
warrant
and
a
search
for
mere
evidence,
and
not
a
search
for
the
instrumentalities
of
the
crime
because
he
didn't
need
those
papers
to
make
a
bet
or
to
make
a
wager.
they
helped
them
at
some
time
but
they
weren't
instrumentalities
of
the
crime
of
transmitting
the
wager
for
the
gambling
information.
mr.
burton
marks
to
compute
the
line
--
mr.
burton
marks
to
get
the
line,
the
daily
line.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
he,
mr.
katz
maybe
off
the
record
a
little
bit
that
he's
one
of
the
best
handicappers
in
the
country.
mr.
burton
marks
one
of
the
best
handicappers
in
the
country
on
basketball
games.
he's
kept
these
--
the
records
of
basketball
teams
for
30
years,
that's
what
these
things
were.
and
he
has
device
his
own
system
for
determining
how
good
the
team
would
be
from
what
the
record
was
of
each
team
playing
against
another
team
over
the
period
of
years.
now,
that
may
have
helped
him
in
making
a
determination
of
what
kind
of
wager
he
was
going
to
make.
mr.
burton
marks
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
we
have
to
do
is
to
go
out
and
have
the
evidence
once
it
was
submitted,
go
in
and
get
his
photo
so
that
he
could
get
copies
of
what
he's
(voice
overlap).
mr.
burton
marks
finally,
i
might
say
this
and
this
is
a
test
that
i
think
the
court
can
take
it's
own
judicial
notice
if
we
took
the
test
and
of
course
again,
it's
outside
of
the
record
but
the
attorney
general,
that's
the
solicitor
general
submitted
it
somewhat
on
his
own
that
you
can
overhear
a
conversation
from
an
adjoining
phone
booth.
i
submit
that
if
the
court
wants
to
make
a
test,
go
and
sit
in
some
phone
booth,
the
one
at
the
sunset
boulevard,
it's
the
ordinary
type
with
a
little
glass
door.
just
sit
in
it
and
listen
next
door
and
see
if
you
can
hear
a
person
and
determine
what
he
is
saying
in
an
ordinary
conversational
voice.
i
submit
that
you
cannot
so
hear
and
that
there
was
intended
to
give
privacy
and
this
right
of
privacy
of
the
individual
should
be
respected.
thank
you.
