justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me
mr.
goldstein,
may
i
ask
you?
do
i
gather
that
you
agree
with
mr.
come
that
the
four-month
limitation
in
101
applies
here
exhaustion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
you
then
because
the
local
i
gather
to
suppose
to
this
within
the
four-month
i
think
you
just
said.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
would've
been
impossible
for
him
to
have
exhausted
his
other
remedies
international
within
the
four-month
period?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
he
have
had
a
right
under
the
union
procedures
to
go
to
the
conventional?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
he
could
have
done
that
within
four
months.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
see.
what
you
mean
then
is
how
do
you
at
least
done
everything
he
could've
done
within
the
four
months
after
he
had
exhausted
such
steps
as
he
could
exhaust
within
four
months
even
though
there
are
other
steps
that
he
could've
as
going
to
the
convention
then
he
would've
been
free
to
go
to
the
board.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
summary
brief
mr.
goldstein,
what
are
the
time
on
its
union
puts
on
his
exhaustion?
what
are
the
steps?
first,
you
have
to
go
to
local
i
gather.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
there
a
time
limit
fixed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
suggesting
mr.
goldstein
that
whenever
may
have
been
so
before
under
taft-hatley
that
at
least
now
establishes
an
exclusive
remedy
for
the
employee
--
union
member
expelled
from
membership?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
that
might
be
a
question
too.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
between
the
federal
court
and
the
board
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
goldstein,
i'm
getting
back
to
your
argument
based
on
102,
what
you
do
with
the
language
of
103
that
makes
succeeding
section
which
in
terms
provides
that
nothing
in
the
preceding
portion
which
will
include
when
a
two
shall
and
i'm
quoting
it,
"limit
the
rights
and
remedies
of
any
member
of
a
labor
organization
under
any
state
or
federal
law
or
before
any
court
or
other
tribunal."
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i've
understood
your
102
argument
that
was
that
102
by
providing
an
action
in
a
federal
district
court
for
either
injunction
or
damages
is
to
be
read
as
expressing
a
congressional
intent
that
that
district
court
action
was
the
exclusive
remedy
to
be
available
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
the
expelled
member,
but
i'm
wondering
whether
that
is
tenable
in
light
of
the
very
language
of
the
very
next
section
103
which
i've
read
you
which
in
terms
says
that
nothing
in
that
section
is
to
limit
any
rights
and
remedies
assuming
there
are
some
that's
all
i'm
--
on
that
hypothesis
of
any
member
of
the
labor
organization
under
state
or
federal
law
or
before
any
court
or
other
tribunals
--
you
don't
conceive
of
the
board
as
a
tribunal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
the
different
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
on
the
premise
that
perhaps
we
wouldn't
agree
with
you
about
that.
i
was
interested
with
your
suggestion
that
even
if
he
did
have
one
102
what
taken
away
from
him
so
far
as
there
was
a
remedy
before
the
board
and
limited
him
to
an
action
in
the
district
court.
