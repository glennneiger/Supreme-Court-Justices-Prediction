is
it
clear
mr.
come
that
nothing
affected
his
employment,
nothing
in
this
case
affected
his
employment
relationship
with

lines?
justice
potter
stewart
section
7
protects
only
concerted
activities,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
correct.
i
mean
in
--
that's
what
its
language
says,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
no
question
about
that
so
far
as
the
act
is
concern
that
an
individual
employee
has
a
right
to
be
a
charging
party
to
file
a
charge
under
section
--
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
but
the
question
is
whether
or
not
that
particular
right
is
one
of
the
rights
protected
section
7
of
the
act
and
you
--
it
has
to
be
in
order
for
you
to
prevail,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
equally
true
that
this
certification
petitioner
for
about
remembering
if
the
board
is
--
how's
the
board
differentiate
that
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
does
not
involved
internal
union
affairs
anymore
than
this
case,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
attack
the
existence
of
the
union
itself
either
as
you
well
know.
justice
potter
stewart
like
the
automobile
workers
are
not
going
to
be
put
on
existences,
they
don't
represent
particular
local
in
a
particular
small
town.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there's
nothing
--
you
can't
point
any
thing
in
the
language
of
the
statute
that
would
differentiate
that
case
from
this
one,
can
you?
justice
potter
stewart
just
a
matter
of
valued
judgment
by
the
board
in
terms
of
public
policy,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
rather
tests
the
correctness
of
the
board's
decision
in
this
case,
i
suggest.
justice
potter
stewart
but
both
agree
it's
not
easier
in
terms
of
what
to
where
the
statute
is
written?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
have
section
8
(a)
(4)
which
expressly
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
do
this
and
the
act
is
entirely
silent
in
respect
to
union's
doing.
justice
potter
stewart
when
you
have
that
additional
argument
in
this
case
that
you
don't
have
a
decertification?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
your
position?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
not
suggesting
that
one
has
to
agree
with
the
rightness
of
allis-chalmers
in
order
to
decide
this
case
in
your
favor,
are
you?
