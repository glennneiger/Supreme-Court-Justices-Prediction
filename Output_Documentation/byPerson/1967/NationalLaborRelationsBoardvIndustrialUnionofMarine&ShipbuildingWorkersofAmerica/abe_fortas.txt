justice

fortas
well,
does
the
employer
have
the

degree

does
the
individual
union
member
have
the
same
degree
of
interest,
same
directness
of
interest
in
the
two
situations?
justice
abe
fortas
firstly
as
in
this
is,
but
it's
no
different
from
the
interest
of
all
other
members?
justice
abe
fortas
before
you
do
that
mr.
goldstein,
what
is
the
chronology
here
mr.
holder
did
file
a
complaint
with
his
local
union,
did
he
not?
justice
abe
fortas
and
do
you
have
the
date
when
he
did
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let
me
ask
you
this,
what
i
want
to
know
is
did
the
local
decide
that
issue
within
or
outside
of
the
four-month-period?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
a
union
member
is
fired
out
of
the
union,
is
it
your
position
that
he's
not
deprived
of
his
right
to
conduct
concerted
activities
under
section
7?
is
that
your
point?
justice
abe
fortas
here,
a
man
belongs
to
a
union
and
as
a
union
member
he
conducts
--
he's
engaged
as
one
of
many
and
collective
bargaining
and
concerted
activities
and
a
union
fires
him,
says,
you're
no
longer
a
member
and
i
take
it
your
point
is
that
despite
that
the
section
7
is
not
implicated.
in
the
other
hand,
it
could
be
argued
that
to
kick
a
man
out
of
the
union
that
you
deprive
him
of
you
at
least
curtail
or
invade
his
right
to
engage
in
concerted
activities.
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
sure
don't
want
to
be
guilty
of
that.
justice
abe
fortas
perhaps
you
just
demonstrated
proposition
which
i
have
heard
that
one
man
circle
is
another
man
is
triangle.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
suppose
a
union
fires
a
man
from
membership
--
justice
abe
fortas
from
membership
in
the
union
terminates
his
membership
in
the
union
and
suppose
he
does
not
have
a
remedy
under
the
unfair
labor
practice
provision
of
the
act,
can
he
go
--
does
a
remedy
in
the
court,
can
he
get
go
to
court,
does
he
have
--
and
the
court
granted
an
injunction
on
a
proper
showing
to
compel
the
union's
reinstating.
justice
abe
fortas
the
record
doesn't
show
what
this
is
all
about,
was
it?
justice
abe
fortas
the
record
doesn't
show
the
controversy
is
between
mr.
holder
and
the
union.
justice
abe
fortas
because
if
we
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
nlrb
has
jurisdiction
in
an
appropriate
case
let
only
the
question
of
exhaustion
of
remedies
if
a
union
member
filed
a
charge
against
the
president
of
the
union
and
its
officers
for
example
of
stealing
or
embezzlement
assuming
like
that.
i
suppose
that
one
can't
escape
thinking
the
corporate
cases
in
which
suit
can
be
brought
by
stock
whole
without
the
man
on
the
corporation
where
that
demand
would
be
useless.
justice
abe
fortas
that
would
not
overwrite
a
clear
statutory
provision
of
course?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the

rule
with

to
corporations?
