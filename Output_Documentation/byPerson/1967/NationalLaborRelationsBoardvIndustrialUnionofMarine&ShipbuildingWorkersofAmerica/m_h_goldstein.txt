mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
saying
anything
else
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
no
error
in
the
record
of
this
case
is
there
anything
to
show
that
the
union
failed
to
process
the
grievance
for
mr.
holder
or
any
of
the
other
facts
respecting
the
detail
of
his
alleged
complain
against
the
union.
i
should
also
like
to
say
that
insofar
as
the
board
argues
public
policy
here
i
think
we
have
two
considerations.
first,
even
if
you
call
expulsion
from
a
union
restraint
or
coercion
and
the
sense
in
which
those
were
to
use
in
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
you
do
not
in
this
case
have
that
restraint
or
coercion
used
to
blank
completely
or
to
punish
for
entry
into
the
board's
processes.
you
have
it
only
as
a
rule
which
under
the
statute
can
delay
and
by
the
statute,
i'm
referring
to
the
landrum-griffin
act,
i
think
section
101
(a)
(4)
can
delay
access
to
the
board
for
four
months
at
the
most.
and
the
second
place
the
congress
has
already
adopted
a
public
policy
on
this
matter,
not
withstanding
all
of
the
scholarly
attempts
to
split
hairs
about
whom
the
proviso
on
section
101
(a)
(4)
of
the
landrum
griffin
act
applies
to
it.
it
is
perfectly
clear
is
set
forth
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
and
it
is
set
forth
in
our
briefs
that
the
best
reasoning
is
that
the
public
policy
would
permit
a
union
itself
or
a
court
or
a
board
to
impose
only
a
four-month
delay.
with
these
preliminary
attempts
to
answer
only
one
or
two
of
the
statements
made
my
brother,
i
should
like
to
say
that
to
me
the
most
stricken
aspect
of
this
case
is
that
the
board
under
the
guide
of
interpreting
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
has
in
effect
legislature
that
a
new
unfair
labor
practice.
i
say
this
because
the
pertinent
statutes
and
their
legislative
history
as
well
as
this
court's
opinion
last
term,
the
allis-chalmers
case,
make
it
so
eminently
clear
that
the
union
conduct
which
the
board
in
this
case
condemns
is
not
violative
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
and
i
believe
that
my
statement
is
warranted
in
addition
by
the
fact
that
this
evidence
is
such
clear
and
preponderant
proof
that
such
conduct
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
that
for
17
years
the
board
its
general
counsel
and
the
courts
uniformly
so
held
indeed
only
a
few
months
before
the
board
decided
the
pre
laguardia
case
namely
the
scura
case.
the
board
stated
after
reviewing
the
relevant
legislative
history
that
it
had
not
been
empowered
by
congress
to
police
a
union
decision
that
a
member
is
or
is
not
in
good
standing
or
to
pass
judgment
on
the
penalties
a
union
may
impose
on
a
member
so
long
as
the
penalty
does
not
impair
the
member
status
as
an
employee
and
it
is
to
be
remember
that
this
case
as
mr.
come
admits
for
the
board
mr.
holder's
status
as
an
employee
was
not
changed
one
wit.
the
board
said
this
in
the
case
of
louis
coniston
motor
company
was
affirmed
that
few
weeks
ago
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
under
the
name
of
scofield
versus
the
again
nlrb.
i
should
like
now
if
i
may
to
list
some
of
the
items
of
evidence
that
demonstrate
that
mr.
holder's
expulsion
from
this
union
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice.
before
doing
so
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
against
the
president
alleging
that
the
president
had
violated
the
national
union's
constitution,
yes
sir.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
that
was
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
oh,
within
and
without
waiting
further
mr.
holder
then
immediately
filed
his
charge
based
on
the
same
facts
with
the
labor
board.
before
going
into
the
enlisting
of
these
items
of
evidence,
i
should
like
to
emphasize
that
the
board
itself
found
that
holder
was
expelled
not
simply
because
he
filed
a
charge
with
the
board
but
be
called
by
doing
some
he
violated
his
duty
under
his
union's
constitution
to
precede
with
the
internal
remedies
provided
by
that
constitution
for
adjusting
his
grievances
against
the
local
union.
i
don't
know
if
i
may
and
interject
to
this
point
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
i
would
mr.
justice
brennan
certainly
agree.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
that's
right
sir.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
the
appeal
to
the
general
executive
board,
yes,
that
would've
been
very
readily
done
because
their
time
limitations
upon
the
length
of
time
that
the
general
executive
board
make
an
assume
in
passing
on
a
case
and
it
did
happen
by
the
way
that
when
the
appeal
when
is
expulsion
by
the
local
union,
the
general
executive
order
very
promptly
heard
the
case
and
very
promptly
decided
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
yes
he
would.
now
that
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
certainly
not.
now,
there
however
i
would
say
to
you
sir
that
unless
the
court
as
a
matter
of
its
own
jurisprudential
discretion
said,
you'd
come
to
exhaust
your
remedies
before
you
come
here.
he
would've
been
free
under
section
101
(8)
(4)
of
the
landrum
griffin
act
to
come
right
to
the
board
and
we
could've
done
nothing
about
it.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
precisely
sir
and
i
would
say
this.
the
union
certainly
would
not
have
been
in
any
position
to
discipline
him
in
any
way
whether
by
suspension
or
by
expulsion.
if
having
utilized
its
internal
processors
for
four
months
and
not
having
gotten
a
final
resolutions
satisfactory
date
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
that's
right
sir.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
for
the
local
to
act?
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
no
sir,
there
is
not.
but
and
there
is
no
time
either
for
the
local
membership
to
pass
on
and
appeal
from
its
executive
board's
decision.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
but
it
seems
to
me
sir
that
none
of
that
is
material
here
because
i
freely
admit
that
once
four
months
have
passed
the
man
is
free
and
in
this
case
the
four
months,
mr.
justice
fortas,
mr.
justice
brennan
had
not
elapsed
otherwise
we
would
have
done
nothing.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
the
best
that
i
can
determine
mr.
chief
justice
from
the
record
is
that
stands
is
that
there
were
about
two
or
three
months
before
between
the
date
of
his
charge
against
the
union
president
and
the
final
disposition
of
his
appeal
to
the
membership,
two
or
three
months
at
the
most.
so
that
he
is
still
have
time
to
go
the
general
like
to
the
board
just
judge
hastie
below
points
out
that
although
that
could
be
a
protracted
proceeding
that
need
not
necessarily
be
so
as
exemplified
by
the
fact
that
in
his
appeal
to
the
general
like
to
the
board
from
the
expulsion
he
got
a
very
expeditious
determination,
judge
hastie
points
that
out.
now,
let
me
if
i
may
list
some
not
all
of
the
items
of
evidence
as
i
see
it
which
make
it
clear
and
should've
made
it
clear
to
the
board
that
there
was
not
in
this
case
a
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
violation.
section
8
(a)
(4)
of
the
act
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
if
this
retry
is
all
upon
an
employee
because
that
employee
has
filed
a
charges
on
to
the
act
it
would
seem
perfectly
simply
possibly
too
simple
logic
to
say
that
had
congress
intended
in
1949
when
that
added
at
section
8
(b)
the
list
of
union
unfair
labor
practices
to
the
wagner
act
to
proscribe
similar
in
action
by
union
in
a
clear
statement
of
that
effect
in
section
8
(b).
indeed,
the
house
in
passing
the
taft-hartley
act
included
in
it
a
section
8
(c)
(5)
which
did
make
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
union
to
find
or
penalize
any
member
because
he
may
charges
for
instituted
proceedings
against
the
union.
the
conference
committing
however
the
--
this
section
from
the
house's
bill
and
the
bill
was
passed
without
it.
so
but
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
there
is
no
provision
in
section
8
(b)
with
respect
to
unions
that
is
cognate
to
section
8
(a)
(4)
with
respect
to
employers.
the
second
piece
of
evidence
because
of
the
absence
of
such
a
specific
provision
in
section
b,
the
board
seeks
to
use
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
as
a
substitute
net
in
which
to
catch
its
fish.
the
volley
of
section
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
union
to
restrain
and
to
coerce
employees
and
the
exercise
of
the
rights
guaranteed
in
section
7.
here
again,
i
appeal
might've
well
sit
down
because
i
think
your
honors
have
what
was
the
facets
of
this
case
very
firmly
in
your
draft
because
as
mr.
justice
stewart
point
out
section
7
however
guarantees
only
the
right
to
engage
or
to
refrain
from
engaging
in
concerted
activities
it
does
not
and
perhaps
not
even
by
implication
let
alone
explicitly
guarantee
any
employee
the
right
to
file
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
my
point
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
must
concede
to
you
that
you
are
impinging
on
a
member's
right
to
engage
a
concerted
activities
when
you
throw
him
out
of
the
union
which
is
the
instrumentality
for
carrying
on
to
concerted
activities
but
i
think
if
one
goes
farther
than
that
one
is
guilty
of
circular
reasoning
because
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
well,
you
might
catch
up
with
yourself
sir.
because
what
happens
there
is
if
we
adopt
your
theory
is
that
the
board
is
punishing
a
union
or
may
punish
a
union
every
time
that
union
for
no
matter
what
reason
expels
or
suspends
a
member
because
every
time
it
does
some
it
is
under
your
reasoning
and
which
i
concur
affecting
the
member's
concerted
activities
or
opportunities
to
engage
him
but
that
is
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
what
the
board
is
doing
here
however
is
saying,
not
that
the
union
interfered
with
holder's
concerted
activities
or
right
to
engage
by
expelling
him
but
that
interfered
with
his
right
to
engage
into
concerted
activity
of
filing
a
charge
by
expelling
and
that's
an
entirely
different
thing.
there
is
--
i
must
concede
as
we
do
in
our
brief
that
the
filing
of
a
charge
may
be
something
in
connection
with
a
concerted
activity
for
example,
seven
men
are
trying
to
organize
a
plan
for
employer
discriminates
against
them
they
filed
a
charge
certainly
they
are
engaging
in
concerted
activity
when
they
final
charge.
one
man
is
treated
in
a
fashion
by
his
employer
but
he
doesn't
like,
he
files
a
charge
that
certainly
is
not
concerted
activity.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
we
never
fire
any
body.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
since
1959,
has
had
a
federal
right
to
be
present
before
that
he
had
state
right
under
the
landrum-griffin
act
you'll
have
your
bill
of
rights
of
members.
one
of
those
bills
of
rights,
one
of
the
rights
rather
in
that
bill
is
the
right
set
forth
in
section
10184
of
a
member
to
sue
either
the
officers
of
his
union
or
his
union
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
one
of
the
things
we
have
to
consider
in
this
case
i
submit
to
your
honors
is
whether
in
that
enactment
10184
and
also
section
102,
that's
right
of
that
act.
congress
has
not
made
a
perfectly
clear
but
the
board
simply
has
no
jurisdiction
over
a
place
in
which
a
member
of
the
union
on
expulsion
from
that
union
seeks
reinstatement.
section
102
of
the
landrum-griffin
act
says
that
any
person
whose
right
secured
by
the
provisions
of
this
title
namely
the
right
to
sue
the
union
or
its
officers
is
one
of
the
rights
have
been
infringed
by
any
violation
of
this
title
made
bring
a
civil
action
in
a
district
court
of
the
united
states
for
such
relief
including
injunctions
mr.
justice
fortas
as
maybe
appropriate
and
this
is
the
significant
portion
of
that
section.
any
such
action
against
the
labor
organization
shall
be
brought
in
the
district
court
of
the
united
states.
and
this
is
precisely
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
under
federal
law
exclusive
of
the
board.
i
think
he's
still
can
go
to
the
state
courts
as
he
could
as
your
honor
know
suppose
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
he
must
go
to
the
federal
court,
that's
one
of
the
propositions
on
which
we
stand.
it
is
not
necessary
to
support
that
proposition
in
order
to
dispose
the
case
in
our
favor
but
we
do
think
that
it
is
one
proposition
that
does
support
the
lower
court.
let
me
if
i
may
get
to
a
third
item
of
evidence.
that
demonstrates
and
i
respectfully
submit
conclusively
that
what
happened
to
mr.
holder
here
was
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
violative
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
all
that
happened
to
holder
was
that
he
was
expelled
from
membership
in
his
union
that
such
union
action
is
outside
the
reach
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
has
been
made
clear,
i
believe,
by
this
court
on
at
least
three
occasions.
first,
in
machinist
versus
gonzales
at
356
u.s,
your
court
spoke
as
follows;
the
protection
of
union
members
in
their
rights
as
members
from
arbitrary
conduct
by
unions
and
union
officers
has
not
been
undertaken
by
federal
law
and
indeed
the
assertion
of
any
such
power
has
been
expressly
denied
and
we're
speaking
there
of
course
concerning
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
the
taft-hartley
act
had
already
been
passed
the
landrum-griffin
act
had
not
yet
been
passed.
the
second
instance
in
which
this
court
pronounce
what
i
deem
to
be
the
piece
of
evidence
i've
just
alluded
to
was
in
nlrb
versus
kingsters
local
639,
the
kurt's
case
in
which
the
court
very
carefully
dealt
into
the
legislative
history
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
and
indicated
in
a
general
way
which
i
think
is
applicable
to
this
case
in
the
board
certainly
knew
of
it
what
this
court
concede
to
be
the
meaning
of
restraint
and
coercion
as
used
in
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
and
finally
the
third
instance
in
which
this
court
in
effect
taught
the
nlrb
what
restraint
and
coercion
is
particularly
as
applicable
to
a
case
very
much
like
the
present
one
was
of
course
your
allis-chalmers
case.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
no,
i
am
not.
i
think
it
can
be
done
independently
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
--
if
one
seeks
support
and
the
supreme
board
allis-chalmers
supplies
that.i'd
like
to
point
to
a
forth
piece
of
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
no,
i
think
i
not
have
mr.
justice
white.
may
i
suggest
to
you
why.
in
allis-chalmers
you
have
a
clear
case
of
a
member
of
the
union
engaging
in
a
section
7
right
namely
he
refrained
from
participating
in
the
concerted
activity
of
the
strike.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
oh
no,
i
wouldn't
lose.
i
point
out
that
my
case
is
much
stronger
than
allis-chalmers
because
in
allis-chalmers
although
clearly
the
member
was
being
punished
for
exercising
a
section
7
right.
nevertheless,
this
court
and
the
board
said
that
there
was
no
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
in
our
case,
there
is
no
showing
in
the
record
whatever
that
holder
engaged
in
the
concerted
activity
and
therefore
when
we
expelled
from
admission
we
are
safely
not
violating
the
literal
meaning
and
the
broad
meaning
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
it
does
not
show
the
details,
it
does
mr.
justice
fortas
show
enough
force
to
know
what
was
about.
he
accused
the
union
of
having
caused
his
demotion
from
a
lead
man's
job
to
an
ordinary
workman's
or
during
that
job
and
that
was
his
whole
complaint
and
he
said
that
the
president
of
the
union
was
responsible
for
that.
he
filed
a
charge
with
the
union
trial
board
against
the
president.
that
charge
was
dismissed
the
president,
was
held
to
be
innocent
whereupon
mr.
holder
and
to
the
board
and
filed
a
charge.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
you
have
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
no,
and
i
think
you
also
have
another
consideration
mr.
justice
fortas
that
there
is
a
strong
indicate
of
the
congressional
dictate
of
what
is
to
be
our
public
policy
is
that
with
respect
to
unions
you
do
attempt
to
had
give
them
an
opportunity
by
making
an
obligation
if
they
wish
to
upon
their
members
then
wash
their
linen
indoors
before
it
comes
out.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
yes.
and
i
think
it's
a
salutatory
rule
if
i
may
presume
to
pass
judgment
on
the
public
policy
declared
by
the
congress.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
i
don't
see
that
that
should
concern
us
here
at
all.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
that
is
what
i
said.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
may
i
express
my
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
--
hold
by
now,
perhaps
i
drew
my
battle
too
long.
perhaps
i
overstated
the
case.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
i
should
have
said
perhaps
in
order
to
be
precise
that
i
would
say
that
this
is
so
that
my
interpretation
is
so
in
the
case
of
the
labor
board
because
the
labor
board
never
had
jurisdiction
over
this
sort
of
case.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
i
don't
think
i
can
say
so
without
a
fairer
study
of
the
legislative
history
in
section
103
because
of
the
phrase
other
tribunal.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
other
tribunal
would
give
me
trouble
unless
i
can
see
what
congress
had
intended.
thank
you
very
much
your
honors.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
saying
anything
else
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
no
error
in
the
record
of
this
case
is
there
anything
to
show
that
the
union
failed
to
process
the
grievance
for
mr.
holder
or
any
of
the
other
facts
respecting
the
detail
of
his
alleged
complain
against
the
union.
i
should
also
like
to
say
that
insofar
as
the
board
argues
public
policy
here
i
think
we
have
two
considerations.
first,
even
if
you
call
expulsion
from
a
union
restraint
or
coercion
and
the
sense
in
which
those
were
to
use
in
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
you
do
not
in
this
case
have
that
restraint
or
coercion
used
to
blank
completely
or
to
punish
for
entry
into
the
board's
processes.
you
have
it
only
as
a
rule
which
under
the
statute
can
delay
and
by
the
statute,
i'm
referring
to
the
landrum-griffin
act,
i
think
section
101
(a)
(4)
can
delay
access
to
the
board
for
four
months
at
the
most.
and
the
second
place
the
congress
has
already
adopted
a
public
policy
on
this
matter,
not
withstanding
all
of
the
scholarly
attempts
to
split
hairs
about
whom
the
proviso
on
section
101
(a)
(4)
of
the
landrum
griffin
act
applies
to
it.
it
is
perfectly
clear
is
set
forth
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
and
it
is
set
forth
in
our
briefs
that
the
best
reasoning
is
that
the
public
policy
would
permit
a
union
itself
or
a
court
or
a
board
to
impose
only
a
four-month
delay.
with
these
preliminary
attempts
to
answer
only
one
or
two
of
the
statements
made
my
brother,
i
should
like
to
say
that
to
me
the
most
stricken
aspect
of
this
case
is
that
the
board
under
the
guide
of
interpreting
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
has
in
effect
legislature
that
a
new
unfair
labor
practice.
i
say
this
because
the
pertinent
statutes
and
their
legislative
history
as
well
as
this
court's
opinion
last
term,
the
allis-chalmers
case,
make
it
so
eminently
clear
that
the
union
conduct
which
the
board
in
this
case
condemns
is
not
violative
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
and
i
believe
that
my
statement
is
warranted
in
addition
by
the
fact
that
this
evidence
is
such
clear
and
preponderant
proof
that
such
conduct
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
that
for
17
years
the
board
its
general
counsel
and
the
courts
uniformly
so
held
indeed
only
a
few
months
before
the
board
decided
the
pre
laguardia
case
namely
the
scura
case.
the
board
stated
after
reviewing
the
relevant
legislative
history
that
it
had
not
been
empowered
by
congress
to
police
a
union
decision
that
a
member
is
or
is
not
in
good
standing
or
to
pass
judgment
on
the
penalties
a
union
may
impose
on
a
member
so
long
as
the
penalty
does
not
impair
the
member
status
as
an
employee
and
it
is
to
be
remember
that
this
case
as
mr.
come
admits
for
the
board
mr.
holder's
status
as
an
employee
was
not
changed
one
wit.
the
board
said
this
in
the
case
of
louis
coniston
motor
company
was
affirmed
that
few
weeks
ago
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
under
the
name
of
scofield
versus
the
again
nlrb.
i
should
like
now
if
i
may
to
list
some
of
the
items
of
evidence
that
demonstrate
that
mr.
holder's
expulsion
from
this
union
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice.
before
doing
so
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
against
the
president
alleging
that
the
president
had
violated
the
national
union's
constitution,
yes
sir.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
that
was
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
oh,
within
and
without
waiting
further
mr.
holder
then
immediately
filed
his
charge
based
on
the
same
facts
with
the
labor
board.
before
going
into
the
enlisting
of
these
items
of
evidence,
i
should
like
to
emphasize
that
the
board
itself
found
that
holder
was
expelled
not
simply
because
he
filed
a
charge
with
the
board
but
be
called
by
doing
some
he
violated
his
duty
under
his
union's
constitution
to
precede
with
the
internal
remedies
provided
by
that
constitution
for
adjusting
his
grievances
against
the
local
union.
i
don't
know
if
i
may
and
interject
to
this
point
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
i
would
mr.
justice
brennan
certainly
agree.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
that's
right
sir.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
the
appeal
to
the
general
executive
board,
yes,
that
would've
been
very
readily
done
because
their
time
limitations
upon
the
length
of
time
that
the
general
executive
board
make
an
assume
in
passing
on
a
case
and
it
did
happen
by
the
way
that
when
the
appeal
when
is
expulsion
by
the
local
union,
the
general
executive
order
very
promptly
heard
the
case
and
very
promptly
decided
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
yes
he
would.
now
that
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
certainly
not.
now,
there
however
i
would
say
to
you
sir
that
unless
the
court
as
a
matter
of
its
own
jurisprudential
discretion
said,
you'd
come
to
exhaust
your
remedies
before
you
come
here.
he
would've
been
free
under
section
101
(8)
(4)
of
the
landrum
griffin
act
to
come
right
to
the
board
and
we
could've
done
nothing
about
it.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
precisely
sir
and
i
would
say
this.
the
union
certainly
would
not
have
been
in
any
position
to
discipline
him
in
any
way
whether
by
suspension
or
by
expulsion.
if
having
utilized
its
internal
processors
for
four
months
and
not
having
gotten
a
final
resolutions
satisfactory
date
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
that's
right
sir.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
for
the
local
to
act?
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
no
sir,
there
is
not.
but
and
there
is
no
time
either
for
the
local
membership
to
pass
on
and
appeal
from
its
executive
board's
decision.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
but
it
seems
to
me
sir
that
none
of
that
is
material
here
because
i
freely
admit
that
once
four
months
have
passed
the
man
is
free
and
in
this
case
the
four
months,
mr.
justice
fortas,
mr.
justice
brennan
had
not
elapsed
otherwise
we
would
have
done
nothing.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
the
best
that
i
can
determine
mr.
chief
justice
from
the
record
is
that
stands
is
that
there
were
about
two
or
three
months
before
between
the
date
of
his
charge
against
the
union
president
and
the
final
disposition
of
his
appeal
to
the
membership,
two
or
three
months
at
the
most.
so
that
he
is
still
have
time
to
go
the
general
like
to
the
board
just
judge
hastie
below
points
out
that
although
that
could
be
a
protracted
proceeding
that
need
not
necessarily
be
so
as
exemplified
by
the
fact
that
in
his
appeal
to
the
general
like
to
the
board
from
the
expulsion
he
got
a
very
expeditious
determination,
judge
hastie
points
that
out.
now,
let
me
if
i
may
list
some
not
all
of
the
items
of
evidence
as
i
see
it
which
make
it
clear
and
should've
made
it
clear
to
the
board
that
there
was
not
in
this
case
a
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
violation.
section
8
(a)
(4)
of
the
act
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
if
this
retry
is
all
upon
an
employee
because
that
employee
has
filed
a
charges
on
to
the
act
it
would
seem
perfectly
simply
possibly
too
simple
logic
to
say
that
had
congress
intended
in
1949
when
that
added
at
section
8
(b)
the
list
of
union
unfair
labor
practices
to
the
wagner
act
to
proscribe
similar
in
action
by
union
in
a
clear
statement
of
that
effect
in
section
8
(b).
indeed,
the
house
in
passing
the
taft-hartley
act
included
in
it
a
section
8
(c)
(5)
which
did
make
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
union
to
find
or
penalize
any
member
because
he
may
charges
for
instituted
proceedings
against
the
union.
the
conference
committing
however
the
--
this
section
from
the
house's
bill
and
the
bill
was
passed
without
it.
so
but
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
there
is
no
provision
in
section
8
(b)
with
respect
to
unions
that
is
cognate
to
section
8
(a)
(4)
with
respect
to
employers.
the
second
piece
of
evidence
because
of
the
absence
of
such
a
specific
provision
in
section
b,
the
board
seeks
to
use
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
as
a
substitute
net
in
which
to
catch
its
fish.
the
volley
of
section
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
union
to
restrain
and
to
coerce
employees
and
the
exercise
of
the
rights
guaranteed
in
section
7.
here
again,
i
appeal
might've
well
sit
down
because
i
think
your
honors
have
what
was
the
facets
of
this
case
very
firmly
in
your
draft
because
as
mr.
justice
stewart
point
out
section
7
however
guarantees
only
the
right
to
engage
or
to
refrain
from
engaging
in
concerted
activities
it
does
not
and
perhaps
not
even
by
implication
let
alone
explicitly
guarantee
any
employee
the
right
to
file
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
my
point
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
must
concede
to
you
that
you
are
impinging
on
a
member's
right
to
engage
a
concerted
activities
when
you
throw
him
out
of
the
union
which
is
the
instrumentality
for
carrying
on
to
concerted
activities
but
i
think
if
one
goes
farther
than
that
one
is
guilty
of
circular
reasoning
because
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
well,
you
might
catch
up
with
yourself
sir.
because
what
happens
there
is
if
we
adopt
your
theory
is
that
the
board
is
punishing
a
union
or
may
punish
a
union
every
time
that
union
for
no
matter
what
reason
expels
or
suspends
a
member
because
every
time
it
does
some
it
is
under
your
reasoning
and
which
i
concur
affecting
the
member's
concerted
activities
or
opportunities
to
engage
him
but
that
is
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
what
the
board
is
doing
here
however
is
saying,
not
that
the
union
interfered
with
holder's
concerted
activities
or
right
to
engage
by
expelling
him
but
that
interfered
with
his
right
to
engage
into
concerted
activity
of
filing
a
charge
by
expelling
and
that's
an
entirely
different
thing.
there
is
--
i
must
concede
as
we
do
in
our
brief
that
the
filing
of
a
charge
may
be
something
in
connection
with
a
concerted
activity
for
example,
seven
men
are
trying
to
organize
a
plan
for
employer
discriminates
against
them
they
filed
a
charge
certainly
they
are
engaging
in
concerted
activity
when
they
final
charge.
one
man
is
treated
in
a
fashion
by
his
employer
but
he
doesn't
like,
he
files
a
charge
that
certainly
is
not
concerted
activity.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
we
never
fire
any
body.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
since
1959,
has
had
a
federal
right
to
be
present
before
that
he
had
state
right
under
the
landrum-griffin
act
you'll
have
your
bill
of
rights
of
members.
one
of
those
bills
of
rights,
one
of
the
rights
rather
in
that
bill
is
the
right
set
forth
in
section
10184
of
a
member
to
sue
either
the
officers
of
his
union
or
his
union
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
one
of
the
things
we
have
to
consider
in
this
case
i
submit
to
your
honors
is
whether
in
that
enactment
10184
and
also
section
102,
that's
right
of
that
act.
congress
has
not
made
a
perfectly
clear
but
the
board
simply
has
no
jurisdiction
over
a
place
in
which
a
member
of
the
union
on
expulsion
from
that
union
seeks
reinstatement.
section
102
of
the
landrum-griffin
act
says
that
any
person
whose
right
secured
by
the
provisions
of
this
title
namely
the
right
to
sue
the
union
or
its
officers
is
one
of
the
rights
have
been
infringed
by
any
violation
of
this
title
made
bring
a
civil
action
in
a
district
court
of
the
united
states
for
such
relief
including
injunctions
mr.
justice
fortas
as
maybe
appropriate
and
this
is
the
significant
portion
of
that
section.
any
such
action
against
the
labor
organization
shall
be
brought
in
the
district
court
of
the
united
states.
and
this
is
precisely
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
under
federal
law
exclusive
of
the
board.
i
think
he's
still
can
go
to
the
state
courts
as
he
could
as
your
honor
know
suppose
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
he
must
go
to
the
federal
court,
that's
one
of
the
propositions
on
which
we
stand.
it
is
not
necessary
to
support
that
proposition
in
order
to
dispose
the
case
in
our
favor
but
we
do
think
that
it
is
one
proposition
that
does
support
the
lower
court.
let
me
if
i
may
get
to
a
third
item
of
evidence.
that
demonstrates
and
i
respectfully
submit
conclusively
that
what
happened
to
mr.
holder
here
was
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
violative
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
all
that
happened
to
holder
was
that
he
was
expelled
from
membership
in
his
union
that
such
union
action
is
outside
the
reach
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
has
been
made
clear,
i
believe,
by
this
court
on
at
least
three
occasions.
first,
in
machinist
versus
gonzales
at
356
u.s,
your
court
spoke
as
follows;
the
protection
of
union
members
in
their
rights
as
members
from
arbitrary
conduct
by
unions
and
union
officers
has
not
been
undertaken
by
federal
law
and
indeed
the
assertion
of
any
such
power
has
been
expressly
denied
and
we're
speaking
there
of
course
concerning
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
the
taft-hartley
act
had
already
been
passed
the
landrum-griffin
act
had
not
yet
been
passed.
the
second
instance
in
which
this
court
pronounce
what
i
deem
to
be
the
piece
of
evidence
i've
just
alluded
to
was
in
nlrb
versus
kingsters
local
639,
the
kurt's
case
in
which
the
court
very
carefully
dealt
into
the
legislative
history
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
and
indicated
in
a
general
way
which
i
think
is
applicable
to
this
case
in
the
board
certainly
knew
of
it
what
this
court
concede
to
be
the
meaning
of
restraint
and
coercion
as
used
in
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
and
finally
the
third
instance
in
which
this
court
in
effect
taught
the
nlrb
what
restraint
and
coercion
is
particularly
as
applicable
to
a
case
very
much
like
the
present
one
was
of
course
your
allis-chalmers
case.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
no,
i
am
not.
i
think
it
can
be
done
independently
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
--
if
one
seeks
support
and
the
supreme
board
allis-chalmers
supplies
that.i'd
like
to
point
to
a
forth
piece
of
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
no,
i
think
i
not
have
mr.
justice
white.
may
i
suggest
to
you
why.
in
allis-chalmers
you
have
a
clear
case
of
a
member
of
the
union
engaging
in
a
section
7
right
namely
he
refrained
from
participating
in
the
concerted
activity
of
the
strike.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
oh
no,
i
wouldn't
lose.
i
point
out
that
my
case
is
much
stronger
than
allis-chalmers
because
in
allis-chalmers
although
clearly
the
member
was
being
punished
for
exercising
a
section
7
right.
nevertheless,
this
court
and
the
board
said
that
there
was
no
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
in
our
case,
there
is
no
showing
in
the
record
whatever
that
holder
engaged
in
the
concerted
activity
and
therefore
when
we
expelled
from
admission
we
are
safely
not
violating
the
literal
meaning
and
the
broad
meaning
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
it
does
not
show
the
details,
it
does
mr.
justice
fortas
show
enough
force
to
know
what
was
about.
he
accused
the
union
of
having
caused
his
demotion
from
a
lead
man's
job
to
an
ordinary
workman's
or
during
that
job
and
that
was
his
whole
complaint
and
he
said
that
the
president
of
the
union
was
responsible
for
that.
he
filed
a
charge
with
the
union
trial
board
against
the
president.
that
charge
was
dismissed
the
president,
was
held
to
be
innocent
whereupon
mr.
holder
and
to
the
board
and
filed
a
charge.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
you
have
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
no,
and
i
think
you
also
have
another
consideration
mr.
justice
fortas
that
there
is
a
strong
indicate
of
the
congressional
dictate
of
what
is
to
be
our
public
policy
is
that
with
respect
to
unions
you
do
attempt
to
had
give
them
an
opportunity
by
making
an
obligation
if
they
wish
to
upon
their
members
then
wash
their
linen
indoors
before
it
comes
out.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
yes.
and
i
think
it's
a
salutatory
rule
if
i
may
presume
to
pass
judgment
on
the
public
policy
declared
by
the
congress.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
i
don't
see
that
that
should
concern
us
here
at
all.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
that
is
what
i
said.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
may
i
express
my
--
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
--
hold
by
now,
perhaps
i
drew
my
battle
too
long.
perhaps
i
overstated
the
case.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
i
should
have
said
perhaps
in
order
to
be
precise
that
i
would
say
that
this
is
so
that
my
interpretation
is
so
in
the
case
of
the
labor
board
because
the
labor
board
never
had
jurisdiction
over
this
sort
of
case.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
i
don't
think
i
can
say
so
without
a
fairer
study
of
the
legislative
history
in
section
103
because
of
the
phrase
other
tribunal.
mr.
m.
h.
goldstein
other
tribunal
would
give
me
trouble
unless
i
can
see
what
congress
had
intended.
thank
you
very
much
your
honors.
