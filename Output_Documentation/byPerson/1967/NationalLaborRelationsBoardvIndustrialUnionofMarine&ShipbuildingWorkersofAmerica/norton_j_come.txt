mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
third
circuit
which
denied
enforcement
of
the
board's
order
directed
for
the
respondent
shipbuilding
workers
union
and
its
local
22.
the
basic
question
is
whether
a
union
violates
section
8
(b)
1
(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
a
disciplining
a
member
for
filing
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
against
the
union
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
before
he's
exhausted
internal
union
procedures
for
the
resolution
of
his
dispute.
now
the
basic
facts
are
these,
early
in
1964,
edward
--
edwin
holder
a
member
of
local
22
and
employed
by
the
united
states
lines
company
is
a
ship
painter
filed
charges
with
the
local
accusing
its
president
of
conduct
violative
of
the
international
union's
constitution.
when
the
locals
trial
board
determined
that
the
president
was
not
guilty
of
the
charges
holder
went
out
pursuing
his
intra
union
procedures
the
international's
constitution
provided
for
appeals
to
the
general
membership
of
the
local
and
then
to
the
general
executive
board
of
the
international
and
finally
to
the
national
convention
filed
unfair
labor
practice
charges
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
covering
the
same
subject
matter.
he
filed
two
charges.
he
filed
one
against
the
union
alleging
that
the
union
had
cause
united
states
lines
to
discriminate
against
him
in
employment
because
of
his
concerted
a
activities
and
violation
of
sections
8
(b)
(2)
and
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
he
filed
a
companion
charge
against
the
company
united
states
line
alleging
that
the
company
had
discriminated
against
him
because
of
his
union
activity
in
violation
of
sections
8
(a)
(1)
and
8
(a)
(3)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
after
filing
of
these
charges
which
i
might
say
upon
investigation
why
the
board's
general
director
would
dismiss
for
lack
of
evidence,
the
union
accused
holder
of
violating
the
provision
of
the
union
constitution
which
provided
that
every
member
shall
exhaust
all
remedies
and
appeals
within
the
union
before
he
shall
resort
to
any
court
or
other
tribunal
outside
of
the
union.
he
was
found
guilty
of
having
violated
this
provision
by
filing
his
charges
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
was
expelled
from
union
membership.
holder
thereupon
filed
another
charge
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
which
forms
the
basis
for
this
proceeding
alleging
that
the
union
by
expelling
him
for
having
filed
his
first
charge
with
the
board
violated
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
of
the
act
which
i
will
get
to
it
in
a
moment.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
there's
no
dispute
that
his
employment
was
not
affected.
the
board
applying
its
current
decision,
in
which
it
had
held
that
a
union
had
violated
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
by
fining
a
member
who
had
filed
charges
against
the
board
found
that
the
union
here
had
violated
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
and
entered
in
appropriate
remedial
order.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
set
aside
the
board's
order,
its
decision
is
in
conflict
with
what
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
did
in
the
roberts
case
upholding
the
a
comparable
board
order.
now,
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
which
this
court
is
well
familiar
with
provides
that
it
shall
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
labor
organization
to
restraint
or
coerce
employees
and
the
exercise
of
the
rights
guaranteed
in
section
7
of
the
act.
i
might
say
that
the
statutory
provisions
are
set
forth
that
beginning
pages
39
of
the
government's
brief.
now,
there's
a
proviso
to
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
that
says
that
this
paragraph
shall
not
impair
the
right
of
a
labor
organization
to
proscribe
its
own
rules
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
or
retention
of
membership
therein.
now,
i
wish
to
acknowledge
at
the
outset
that
i've
got
a
problem
with
this
proviso
and
i
have
a
further
problem
with
this
court's
decision
in
allis-chalmers
on
the
last
term
which
i
hope
i
can
overcome
but
before
i
get
to
that
i
would
just
like
to
deal
momentarily
with
the
subsidiary
contention
that
there's
no
in
permanent
of
section
7
right
here
to
begin
with.
now,
i
think
that
the
courts
have
pretty
clearly
establish
and
even
the
court
below
acknowledges
that
the
right
to
file
a
charge
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
even
though
it
is
not
specifically
enumerated
in
section
7
of
the
act
is
included
in
thereby
necessary
implication
for
the
simple
reason
and
as
this
court
has
recognized
only
most
recently
early
this
time
in
the
nash
case.
the
board
can
only
act
on
a
charges
file
and
therefore
as
a
necessary
precondition
of
vindicating
all
the
other
rights
they
are
specifically
enumerated
in
section
7.
there
must
be
the
right
to
file
a
charge.
secondly,
i
think
that
it
is
also
well
settled
that
a
charge
since
it
merely
sets
in
the
motion,
the
board
machinery
doesn't
have
to
have
the
specificity
of
a
formal
plea
and
that
the
charge
here
although
the
court
below
seem
to
think
to
the
contrary
was
certainly
specific
enough
to
show
that
holder
was
complaining
of
a
violation
of
a
section
7
rights
so
that
i
think
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
--
that
contention
is
raised
by
the
union
and
i
think
that
that
is
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
says
the
employee
shall
have
a
right
to
self
organization
before
him
join
or
resist
labor
organizations.
the
bargain
collectively
through
representatives
of
their
own
choosing
and
to
engage
in
other
concerted
activities
for
the
purpose
of
collective
bargaining
or
other
mutual
aid
or
protection
and
shall
also
have
the
right
to
refrain
from
any
all
such
activities.
now,
there
is
no
question
that
an
individual
has
a
right
to
complain
of
union
activity
that
interferes
with
his
right
to
refrain
from
engaging
in
union
activity.
i
mean,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
concerted
in
the
sense
that
it's
a
grievance
that
he's
alleging
not
only
for
himself
but
for
other
people.
now,
what
holder
was
complaining
about
here
was
that
the
union
was
discriminating
or
causing
the
employer
to
discriminate
against
him
and
to
prior
of
employment
opportunities
because
of
position
that
he
had
either
taken
or
failed
to
take
with
regard
to
the
union.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
kind
of
complaint
that
holder
may
is
the
garden
variety
kind
of
complaint
if
there
were
merit
to
it
that
would
be
found
to
violate
8
(b)
(2)
if
you
could
prove
that
the
union
was
discriminating
against
him
for
the
reason
that
he
alleged
or
that
the
company
was
violating
8
(a)
(3)
if
the
act
we
asked
in
the
union's
causing
the
discrimination.
secondly,
there's
also
a
matter
as
to
whether
or
not
the
union
had
failed
to
process
a
grievance
alleging
this
problem
in
good
faith
which
could
raise
a
problem
as
to
whether
there
was
a
duty
of
the
union's
violations
of
the
duties
of
the
union's
duty
fair
representation
which
will
give
you
in
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
violation.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
although
there
may
be
situations
at
the
periphery
as
to
whether
the
filing
of
a
charge
is
a
section
7
activity
or
not.
the
sort
of
thing
that
holder
was
complaining
of
here
if
the
evidence
sustained
his
contention
what
have
been
clear
violations
of
the
statue
and
i
think
that
that
is
all
that
we
have
to
show
to
get
in
the
ball
park
here.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
one
other
thing
under
section
7
and
to
put
and
that
is
that
if
the
individual
is
protected
in
his
right
to
file
a
charge
he
has
the
right
to
file
the
charge
under
the
act
is
promptly
as
possible
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
a
decision
earlier
this
term
there
is
no
requirement
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
for
the
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies.
it's
a
matter
of
fact,
section
10
(a)
of
the
act
says
that
the
board's
power
shall
not
be
affected
by
any
other
private
means
of
adjustment
and
section
10
(b)
of
the
act
which
sets
a
six
months
statute
of
limitations
period
indeed
encourages
a
prompt
filing
of
charges
so
that
we
start
then
at
least
in
our
view
of
it
with
a
situation
where
the
union
by
expelling
holder
for
filing
charges
with
the
board
promptly
without
exhausting
his
internal
union
remedy
in
a
very
real
sense
has
restraint
or
coerced
him
in
a
exercising
freely
the
right
that
section
7
would
give
him
the
file
such
a
charge
promptly
irrespective
of
whether
an
investigation
it
prove
to
have
merit
as
long
at
least
is
there
was
no
showing
that
he
acted
in
bad
faith
and
there
is
none
here.
so,
then
we
come
to
the
problem
as
to
whether
or
not
this
restraint
or
coercion
is
legal
restraint
or
coercion
and
that
brings
us
to
the
proviso
of
the
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
and
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
allis-chalmers
case.
now,
for
the
union
this
is
a
very
easy
case.
they
read
the
terms
of
the
proviso
and
they
say
that
this
exhaustion
requirement
was
a
membership
requirement
which
holder
a
great
too
when
he
joined
the
union
by
violating
this
membership
requirement.
the
union
had
disciplined
and
that
ends
the
ball
game
for
them
because
they
apply
the
plain
meaning
rule
and
they
say
how
plainer
can
you
get
something
that
fits
within
the
terms
of
the
statute.
now,
i
admit
that
that
is
a
persuasive
argument
however,
this
court
has
often
times
cautioned
that
a
plain
meaning
rule
particularly
with
respect
to
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
is
not
a
very
reliable
guide
as
to
the
reach
of
the
provision
but
you
have
to
look
at
the
statute
in
the
light
of
its
legislative
history
and
even
more
importantly
in
the
light
of
the
other
provisions
of
the
statute
because
congress
in
enacting
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
was
trying
to
fit
it
into
a
unified
statutory
pattern.
now,
when
we
look
at
the
unified
statutory
pattern,
what
do
we
find?
well,
we
find
first
of
all
as
i've
indicated
that
under
section
10
(b)
of
the
act
the
board
cannot
act
unless
a
charge
is
filed.
you
look
at
the
employer's
side
of
the
picture
and
you
find
that
employer
coercion
in
respect
to
the
filing
of
charges
is
prohibited.
it's
not
only
prohibited
it's
specifically
under
section
8
(a)
(4)
but
it
has
been
held
even
by
the
court
below
that
such
employer
coercion
is
been
held
to
violate
the
general
terms
of
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
statute
which
bars
employer
in
general
terms
restraint
coercion
and
the
exercise
of
section
7
rights.
now,
looking
at
those
provisions
this
court
in
the
nash
case
earlier
this
term
said
this
indicates
that
congress
intended
that
an
individual
would
be
free
of
all
coercion
in
respect
to
the
filing
of
unfair
labor
practice
charges.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
court
said,
employer
and
union
coercion
and
referred
to
the
roberts
case,
nash
to
be
sure
that
not
involve
a
union
coercion
and
involved
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
state
of
florida's
policy
of
denying
an
individual
unemployment
compensation
because
he
had
filed
charges
was
in
conflict
with
the
scheme
of
the
act.
so
then
we
say
in
the
light
of
this
statutory
pattern
it
is
reasonable
for
the
board
to
read
the
general
restraint
and
coercion
terms
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
as
affording
the
same
protection
against
union
coercion
in
respect
for
the
filing
of
charges
that
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
act
provides
against
employer
coercion.
now,
in
the
allis-chalmers
case
which
was
decided
last
term
this
court
held
that
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
did
not
bar
a
union
from
finding
those
of
its
members
who
refused
to
heed
the
union's
strike
ball
and
seeking
to
collect
those
fines
by
state
court
suits.
now,
in
reaching
that
conclusion
the
court
relied
upon
two
principle
things
as
i
read
the
decision.
one,
that
the
right
to
strike
was
an
important
weapon
in
the
union's
economic
arsenal
and
unless
it
had
a
power
to
find
strike
breakers,
the
right
to
strike
would
be
substantially
impaired
and
secondly,
that
as
the
court
read
the
legislative
history
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
and
its
proviso
it
indicated
that
congress
did
not
propose
any
limitation
with
respect
to
the
internal
affairs
of
a
labor
union.
now,
i
should
point
out
that
as
the
court
is
well
aware
that
allis-chalmers
was
a
five
to
four
decision
and
mr.
justice
white
in
his
concurring
opinion
indicated
that
he
did
not
read
the
majority
opinion
as
privileging
any
union
rule
no
matter
how
unreasonable
or
unenforceable
on
its
face.
it
appeared
to
be.
now,
apart
from
that
however
we
submit
that
as
mr.--
as
judge
fay
pointed
out
for
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
roberts
case
that
a
union
rule
that
would
penalize
employees
for
filing
charges
with
the
board
goes
beyond
the
area
of
internal
union
affairs
that
congress
was
concerned
about
in
enacting
the
--
and
in
providing
an
exemption
under
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
as
judge
fay
put
it
such
a
rule
goes
beyond
the
internal
affairs
of
the
union
and
into
the
public
domain
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
you're
quite
right
in
pointing
out
that
the
board
has
differentiated
decertification.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
the
decertification
petition
case
is
a
trouble
someone.
i
think
that
it
part
takes
of
much
of
the
same
aspects
that
i'm
talking
about
with
respect
to
a
charge.
however,
there
is
this
difference
and
that
is
that
with
respect
to
a
charge
the
individual
is
complaining
that
the
union
has
violated
his
statutory
right
with
respect
to
a
decertification
petition
he
is
attacking
the
very
existence
of
the
union
itself
and
a
decertification
petition
is
going
to
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
he
is
in
the
sense
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
you
have
the
further
problem
that
it's
well
acknowledge
that
a
union
is
entitled
to
protect
itself
against
disloyalty
and
its
ranks
and
whether
decertification
petition
means
that
you're
going
to
have
an
election
campaign.
you're
going
to
and
the
question
is
whether
the
union
has
to
keep
to
its
bosom
a
defector
while
this
election
campaign
is
going
on.
now,
this
is
what
the
board
thought
keep
the
balance
the
other
way.
i
think
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no
i
cannot.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
believe
so.
however,
i
do
not
think
that
we
have
to
decide
the
correctness
of
that
the
board's
position
in
that
case
and
this
time,
i
think
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
won't
dispute
that
but
as
you
can
appreciate
your
honor
whenever
you
have
competing
policies
as
you
do
have
here,
the
one
hand
the
policy
in
favor
of
giving
a
protection
to
internal
union
affairs
and
on
the
other
hand
a
policy
of
keeping
the
channels
of
the
board
open.
there
is
going
to
come
point
where
those
policies
are
going
to
get
very
close
together
and
you
could
very
easily
go
on
either
side
of
that
line
and
i
think
that
decertification
case
is
in
that
area.
i
think
it
gets
very,
very
close.
i
think
that
the
charge
case
however
in
the
allis-chalmers
case
are
--
it's
easier
to
separate
them
out.
now,
i
just
want
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i
think
not
except
with
this
exception
that
with
respect
to
the
filing
of
a
charge
section
10
(b)
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
a
board
cannot
act
unless
a
charge
is
filed.
you'll
also
have
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
act
which
bars
employer
coercion
for
interfering
with
the
section
7
rights.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
is
correct
however
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that's
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
and
i'm
not
minimizing
the
difficulties
that
i
have
with
the
decertification
case.
i
submit
that
we're
entitled
to
prevail
here
even
if
they
are
wrong
in
the
decertification
case
and
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
in
the
charge
case
he
certainly
has
a
very
immediate
interest
and
that
what
he
is
complaining
about
is
that
the
union
has
violated
his
statutory
right.
now,
with
respect
to
the
decertification
petition,
he
has
a
real
interest
and
i
would
have
acknowledge
in
the
sense
that
he
is
saying
that
this
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
in
that
sense
there
is
a
difference.
however,
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
not
only
does
the
filing
of
a
charge
get
into
the
public
domain
but
it
is
been
recognized
by
scholars
in
the
field
that
these
restrictions
in
union
constitutions
against
resort
to
the
courts
and
other
outside
tribunals
are
acknowledged
to
be
against
the
public
policy
as
archibald
cox
pointed
out
the
restriction
is
against
public
policy,
no
private
organization
should
be
permitted
to
restrict
any
person's
access
to
the
court's
of
justice
no
less
than
restrict
his
right
to
petition
the
legislature
to
communicate
with
the
member
of
congress.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
reading
the
proviso
in
the
light
of
section
10
(b)
of
the
act
and
necessity
for
the
board
to
have
a
charge
before
it
can
act,
the
provision
in
section
8
(a)
(1)
that
would
proscribe
employer
coercion
in
respect
for
the
filing
of
charges
the
fact
that
a
restriction
on
resort
to
the
board
is
commonly
acknowledged
to
be
contrary
to
public
policy.
the
board
is
reasonable
in
saying
that
the
literal
terms
of
the
proviso
were
not
intended
to
accomplish
a
union
restriction
on
the
filing
of
charges
because
it
is
contrary
such
a
reading
of
the
proviso
would
be
contrary
to
the
scheme
of
the
remainder
of
the
act
and
to
recognize
public
policy
so
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
say
that
the
proviso
would
apply
to
other
to
the
normal
area
of
internal
union
affair
such
as
the
kind
of
union
rule
that
you
had
in
allis-chalmers
and
but
not
to
a
union
rule
such
as
the
one
that
we
have
here
that
goes
beyond
the
area
of
internal
union
affairs
and
attempts
to
choke
off
the
procedures
of
the
board.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
in
the
moments
that
are
remaining
to
me
that
there
is
a
big
distinction
between
a
union
restriction
on
resort
to
public
tribunals
and
the
rule
of
judicial
administration.
there's
a
well
recognized
principle
of
judicial
administration
that
in
these
union's
suits
that
says
when
a
union
comes
to
a
court,
the
court
if
it
is
persuaded
that
it
has
an
adequate
union
remedy
will
stay
its
hand
and
remit
--
may
i
just
finish
my
argue
--
will
remit
the
individual
to
his
union
tribunal.
we
say
that
that
is
a
far
cry
from
a
union
sanction
because
there
the
individual
has
a
chance
to
go
to
an
impartial
tribunal
for
the
impartial
tribunal
to
make
a
judgment
to
whether
the
union
procedure
is
in
fact
adequate
and
then
can
remit
them.
if
on
the
other
hand
the
tribunal
is
satisfied
at
the
procedure
is
inadequate,
it
can
give
the
member
immediate
relief
without
requiring
the
member
to
guess
is
to
whether
or
not
he
has
got
a
situation
that
can
wait
or
can't
wait
if
he
guesses
wrong
union
discipline
sticks.
for
those
reason
we
submit
that
the
court
herein
denying
enforcement
to
the
board's
order
in
this
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
third
circuit
which
denied
enforcement
of
the
board's
order
directed
for
the
respondent
shipbuilding
workers
union
and
its
local
22.
the
basic
question
is
whether
a
union
violates
section
8
(b)
1
(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
a
disciplining
a
member
for
filing
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
against
the
union
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
before
he's
exhausted
internal
union
procedures
for
the
resolution
of
his
dispute.
now
the
basic
facts
are
these,
early
in
1964,
edward
--
edwin
holder
a
member
of
local
22
and
employed
by
the
united
states
lines
company
is
a
ship
painter
filed
charges
with
the
local
accusing
its
president
of
conduct
violative
of
the
international
union's
constitution.
when
the
locals
trial
board
determined
that
the
president
was
not
guilty
of
the
charges
holder
went
out
pursuing
his
intra
union
procedures
the
international's
constitution
provided
for
appeals
to
the
general
membership
of
the
local
and
then
to
the
general
executive
board
of
the
international
and
finally
to
the
national
convention
filed
unfair
labor
practice
charges
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
covering
the
same
subject
matter.
he
filed
two
charges.
he
filed
one
against
the
union
alleging
that
the
union
had
cause
united
states
lines
to
discriminate
against
him
in
employment
because
of
his
concerted
a
activities
and
violation
of
sections
8
(b)
(2)
and
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
he
filed
a
companion
charge
against
the
company
united
states
line
alleging
that
the
company
had
discriminated
against
him
because
of
his
union
activity
in
violation
of
sections
8
(a)
(1)
and
8
(a)
(3)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
after
filing
of
these
charges
which
i
might
say
upon
investigation
why
the
board's
general
director
would
dismiss
for
lack
of
evidence,
the
union
accused
holder
of
violating
the
provision
of
the
union
constitution
which
provided
that
every
member
shall
exhaust
all
remedies
and
appeals
within
the
union
before
he
shall
resort
to
any
court
or
other
tribunal
outside
of
the
union.
he
was
found
guilty
of
having
violated
this
provision
by
filing
his
charges
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
was
expelled
from
union
membership.
holder
thereupon
filed
another
charge
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
which
forms
the
basis
for
this
proceeding
alleging
that
the
union
by
expelling
him
for
having
filed
his
first
charge
with
the
board
violated
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
of
the
act
which
i
will
get
to
it
in
a
moment.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
there's
no
dispute
that
his
employment
was
not
affected.
the
board
applying
its
current
decision,
in
which
it
had
held
that
a
union
had
violated
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
by
fining
a
member
who
had
filed
charges
against
the
board
found
that
the
union
here
had
violated
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
and
entered
in
appropriate
remedial
order.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
set
aside
the
board's
order,
its
decision
is
in
conflict
with
what
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
did
in
the
roberts
case
upholding
the
a
comparable
board
order.
now,
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
which
this
court
is
well
familiar
with
provides
that
it
shall
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
labor
organization
to
restraint
or
coerce
employees
and
the
exercise
of
the
rights
guaranteed
in
section
7
of
the
act.
i
might
say
that
the
statutory
provisions
are
set
forth
that
beginning
pages
39
of
the
government's
brief.
now,
there's
a
proviso
to
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
that
says
that
this
paragraph
shall
not
impair
the
right
of
a
labor
organization
to
proscribe
its
own
rules
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
or
retention
of
membership
therein.
now,
i
wish
to
acknowledge
at
the
outset
that
i've
got
a
problem
with
this
proviso
and
i
have
a
further
problem
with
this
court's
decision
in
allis-chalmers
on
the
last
term
which
i
hope
i
can
overcome
but
before
i
get
to
that
i
would
just
like
to
deal
momentarily
with
the
subsidiary
contention
that
there's
no
in
permanent
of
section
7
right
here
to
begin
with.
now,
i
think
that
the
courts
have
pretty
clearly
establish
and
even
the
court
below
acknowledges
that
the
right
to
file
a
charge
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
even
though
it
is
not
specifically
enumerated
in
section
7
of
the
act
is
included
in
thereby
necessary
implication
for
the
simple
reason
and
as
this
court
has
recognized
only
most
recently
early
this
time
in
the
nash
case.
the
board
can
only
act
on
a
charges
file
and
therefore
as
a
necessary
precondition
of
vindicating
all
the
other
rights
they
are
specifically
enumerated
in
section
7.
there
must
be
the
right
to
file
a
charge.
secondly,
i
think
that
it
is
also
well
settled
that
a
charge
since
it
merely
sets
in
the
motion,
the
board
machinery
doesn't
have
to
have
the
specificity
of
a
formal
plea
and
that
the
charge
here
although
the
court
below
seem
to
think
to
the
contrary
was
certainly
specific
enough
to
show
that
holder
was
complaining
of
a
violation
of
a
section
7
rights
so
that
i
think
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
--
that
contention
is
raised
by
the
union
and
i
think
that
that
is
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
says
the
employee
shall
have
a
right
to
self
organization
before
him
join
or
resist
labor
organizations.
the
bargain
collectively
through
representatives
of
their
own
choosing
and
to
engage
in
other
concerted
activities
for
the
purpose
of
collective
bargaining
or
other
mutual
aid
or
protection
and
shall
also
have
the
right
to
refrain
from
any
all
such
activities.
now,
there
is
no
question
that
an
individual
has
a
right
to
complain
of
union
activity
that
interferes
with
his
right
to
refrain
from
engaging
in
union
activity.
i
mean,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
concerted
in
the
sense
that
it's
a
grievance
that
he's
alleging
not
only
for
himself
but
for
other
people.
now,
what
holder
was
complaining
about
here
was
that
the
union
was
discriminating
or
causing
the
employer
to
discriminate
against
him
and
to
prior
of
employment
opportunities
because
of
position
that
he
had
either
taken
or
failed
to
take
with
regard
to
the
union.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
kind
of
complaint
that
holder
may
is
the
garden
variety
kind
of
complaint
if
there
were
merit
to
it
that
would
be
found
to
violate
8
(b)
(2)
if
you
could
prove
that
the
union
was
discriminating
against
him
for
the
reason
that
he
alleged
or
that
the
company
was
violating
8
(a)
(3)
if
the
act
we
asked
in
the
union's
causing
the
discrimination.
secondly,
there's
also
a
matter
as
to
whether
or
not
the
union
had
failed
to
process
a
grievance
alleging
this
problem
in
good
faith
which
could
raise
a
problem
as
to
whether
there
was
a
duty
of
the
union's
violations
of
the
duties
of
the
union's
duty
fair
representation
which
will
give
you
in
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
violation.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
although
there
may
be
situations
at
the
periphery
as
to
whether
the
filing
of
a
charge
is
a
section
7
activity
or
not.
the
sort
of
thing
that
holder
was
complaining
of
here
if
the
evidence
sustained
his
contention
what
have
been
clear
violations
of
the
statue
and
i
think
that
that
is
all
that
we
have
to
show
to
get
in
the
ball
park
here.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
one
other
thing
under
section
7
and
to
put
and
that
is
that
if
the
individual
is
protected
in
his
right
to
file
a
charge
he
has
the
right
to
file
the
charge
under
the
act
is
promptly
as
possible
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
a
decision
earlier
this
term
there
is
no
requirement
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
for
the
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies.
it's
a
matter
of
fact,
section
10
(a)
of
the
act
says
that
the
board's
power
shall
not
be
affected
by
any
other
private
means
of
adjustment
and
section
10
(b)
of
the
act
which
sets
a
six
months
statute
of
limitations
period
indeed
encourages
a
prompt
filing
of
charges
so
that
we
start
then
at
least
in
our
view
of
it
with
a
situation
where
the
union
by
expelling
holder
for
filing
charges
with
the
board
promptly
without
exhausting
his
internal
union
remedy
in
a
very
real
sense
has
restraint
or
coerced
him
in
a
exercising
freely
the
right
that
section
7
would
give
him
the
file
such
a
charge
promptly
irrespective
of
whether
an
investigation
it
prove
to
have
merit
as
long
at
least
is
there
was
no
showing
that
he
acted
in
bad
faith
and
there
is
none
here.
so,
then
we
come
to
the
problem
as
to
whether
or
not
this
restraint
or
coercion
is
legal
restraint
or
coercion
and
that
brings
us
to
the
proviso
of
the
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
and
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
allis-chalmers
case.
now,
for
the
union
this
is
a
very
easy
case.
they
read
the
terms
of
the
proviso
and
they
say
that
this
exhaustion
requirement
was
a
membership
requirement
which
holder
a
great
too
when
he
joined
the
union
by
violating
this
membership
requirement.
the
union
had
disciplined
and
that
ends
the
ball
game
for
them
because
they
apply
the
plain
meaning
rule
and
they
say
how
plainer
can
you
get
something
that
fits
within
the
terms
of
the
statute.
now,
i
admit
that
that
is
a
persuasive
argument
however,
this
court
has
often
times
cautioned
that
a
plain
meaning
rule
particularly
with
respect
to
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
is
not
a
very
reliable
guide
as
to
the
reach
of
the
provision
but
you
have
to
look
at
the
statute
in
the
light
of
its
legislative
history
and
even
more
importantly
in
the
light
of
the
other
provisions
of
the
statute
because
congress
in
enacting
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
was
trying
to
fit
it
into
a
unified
statutory
pattern.
now,
when
we
look
at
the
unified
statutory
pattern,
what
do
we
find?
well,
we
find
first
of
all
as
i've
indicated
that
under
section
10
(b)
of
the
act
the
board
cannot
act
unless
a
charge
is
filed.
you
look
at
the
employer's
side
of
the
picture
and
you
find
that
employer
coercion
in
respect
to
the
filing
of
charges
is
prohibited.
it's
not
only
prohibited
it's
specifically
under
section
8
(a)
(4)
but
it
has
been
held
even
by
the
court
below
that
such
employer
coercion
is
been
held
to
violate
the
general
terms
of
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
statute
which
bars
employer
in
general
terms
restraint
coercion
and
the
exercise
of
section
7
rights.
now,
looking
at
those
provisions
this
court
in
the
nash
case
earlier
this
term
said
this
indicates
that
congress
intended
that
an
individual
would
be
free
of
all
coercion
in
respect
to
the
filing
of
unfair
labor
practice
charges.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
court
said,
employer
and
union
coercion
and
referred
to
the
roberts
case,
nash
to
be
sure
that
not
involve
a
union
coercion
and
involved
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
state
of
florida's
policy
of
denying
an
individual
unemployment
compensation
because
he
had
filed
charges
was
in
conflict
with
the
scheme
of
the
act.
so
then
we
say
in
the
light
of
this
statutory
pattern
it
is
reasonable
for
the
board
to
read
the
general
restraint
and
coercion
terms
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
as
affording
the
same
protection
against
union
coercion
in
respect
for
the
filing
of
charges
that
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
act
provides
against
employer
coercion.
now,
in
the
allis-chalmers
case
which
was
decided
last
term
this
court
held
that
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
did
not
bar
a
union
from
finding
those
of
its
members
who
refused
to
heed
the
union's
strike
ball
and
seeking
to
collect
those
fines
by
state
court
suits.
now,
in
reaching
that
conclusion
the
court
relied
upon
two
principle
things
as
i
read
the
decision.
one,
that
the
right
to
strike
was
an
important
weapon
in
the
union's
economic
arsenal
and
unless
it
had
a
power
to
find
strike
breakers,
the
right
to
strike
would
be
substantially
impaired
and
secondly,
that
as
the
court
read
the
legislative
history
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
and
its
proviso
it
indicated
that
congress
did
not
propose
any
limitation
with
respect
to
the
internal
affairs
of
a
labor
union.
now,
i
should
point
out
that
as
the
court
is
well
aware
that
allis-chalmers
was
a
five
to
four
decision
and
mr.
justice
white
in
his
concurring
opinion
indicated
that
he
did
not
read
the
majority
opinion
as
privileging
any
union
rule
no
matter
how
unreasonable
or
unenforceable
on
its
face.
it
appeared
to
be.
now,
apart
from
that
however
we
submit
that
as
mr.--
as
judge
fay
pointed
out
for
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
roberts
case
that
a
union
rule
that
would
penalize
employees
for
filing
charges
with
the
board
goes
beyond
the
area
of
internal
union
affairs
that
congress
was
concerned
about
in
enacting
the
--
and
in
providing
an
exemption
under
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
as
judge
fay
put
it
such
a
rule
goes
beyond
the
internal
affairs
of
the
union
and
into
the
public
domain
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
you're
quite
right
in
pointing
out
that
the
board
has
differentiated
decertification.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
the
decertification
petition
case
is
a
trouble
someone.
i
think
that
it
part
takes
of
much
of
the
same
aspects
that
i'm
talking
about
with
respect
to
a
charge.
however,
there
is
this
difference
and
that
is
that
with
respect
to
a
charge
the
individual
is
complaining
that
the
union
has
violated
his
statutory
right
with
respect
to
a
decertification
petition
he
is
attacking
the
very
existence
of
the
union
itself
and
a
decertification
petition
is
going
to
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
he
is
in
the
sense
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
you
have
the
further
problem
that
it's
well
acknowledge
that
a
union
is
entitled
to
protect
itself
against
disloyalty
and
its
ranks
and
whether
decertification
petition
means
that
you're
going
to
have
an
election
campaign.
you're
going
to
and
the
question
is
whether
the
union
has
to
keep
to
its
bosom
a
defector
while
this
election
campaign
is
going
on.
now,
this
is
what
the
board
thought
keep
the
balance
the
other
way.
i
think
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no
i
cannot.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
believe
so.
however,
i
do
not
think
that
we
have
to
decide
the
correctness
of
that
the
board's
position
in
that
case
and
this
time,
i
think
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
won't
dispute
that
but
as
you
can
appreciate
your
honor
whenever
you
have
competing
policies
as
you
do
have
here,
the
one
hand
the
policy
in
favor
of
giving
a
protection
to
internal
union
affairs
and
on
the
other
hand
a
policy
of
keeping
the
channels
of
the
board
open.
there
is
going
to
come
point
where
those
policies
are
going
to
get
very
close
together
and
you
could
very
easily
go
on
either
side
of
that
line
and
i
think
that
decertification
case
is
in
that
area.
i
think
it
gets
very,
very
close.
i
think
that
the
charge
case
however
in
the
allis-chalmers
case
are
--
it's
easier
to
separate
them
out.
now,
i
just
want
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i
think
not
except
with
this
exception
that
with
respect
to
the
filing
of
a
charge
section
10
(b)
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
a
board
cannot
act
unless
a
charge
is
filed.
you'll
also
have
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
act
which
bars
employer
coercion
for
interfering
with
the
section
7
rights.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
is
correct
however
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that's
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
and
i'm
not
minimizing
the
difficulties
that
i
have
with
the
decertification
case.
i
submit
that
we're
entitled
to
prevail
here
even
if
they
are
wrong
in
the
decertification
case
and
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
in
the
charge
case
he
certainly
has
a
very
immediate
interest
and
that
what
he
is
complaining
about
is
that
the
union
has
violated
his
statutory
right.
now,
with
respect
to
the
decertification
petition,
he
has
a
real
interest
and
i
would
have
acknowledge
in
the
sense
that
he
is
saying
that
this
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
in
that
sense
there
is
a
difference.
however,
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
not
only
does
the
filing
of
a
charge
get
into
the
public
domain
but
it
is
been
recognized
by
scholars
in
the
field
that
these
restrictions
in
union
constitutions
against
resort
to
the
courts
and
other
outside
tribunals
are
acknowledged
to
be
against
the
public
policy
as
archibald
cox
pointed
out
the
restriction
is
against
public
policy,
no
private
organization
should
be
permitted
to
restrict
any
person's
access
to
the
court's
of
justice
no
less
than
restrict
his
right
to
petition
the
legislature
to
communicate
with
the
member
of
congress.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
reading
the
proviso
in
the
light
of
section
10
(b)
of
the
act
and
necessity
for
the
board
to
have
a
charge
before
it
can
act,
the
provision
in
section
8
(a)
(1)
that
would
proscribe
employer
coercion
in
respect
for
the
filing
of
charges
the
fact
that
a
restriction
on
resort
to
the
board
is
commonly
acknowledged
to
be
contrary
to
public
policy.
the
board
is
reasonable
in
saying
that
the
literal
terms
of
the
proviso
were
not
intended
to
accomplish
a
union
restriction
on
the
filing
of
charges
because
it
is
contrary
such
a
reading
of
the
proviso
would
be
contrary
to
the
scheme
of
the
remainder
of
the
act
and
to
recognize
public
policy
so
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
say
that
the
proviso
would
apply
to
other
to
the
normal
area
of
internal
union
affair
such
as
the
kind
of
union
rule
that
you
had
in
allis-chalmers
and
but
not
to
a
union
rule
such
as
the
one
that
we
have
here
that
goes
beyond
the
area
of
internal
union
affairs
and
attempts
to
choke
off
the
procedures
of
the
board.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
in
the
moments
that
are
remaining
to
me
that
there
is
a
big
distinction
between
a
union
restriction
on
resort
to
public
tribunals
and
the
rule
of
judicial
administration.
there's
a
well
recognized
principle
of
judicial
administration
that
in
these
union's
suits
that
says
when
a
union
comes
to
a
court,
the
court
if
it
is
persuaded
that
it
has
an
adequate
union
remedy
will
stay
its
hand
and
remit
--
may
i
just
finish
my
argue
--
will
remit
the
individual
to
his
union
tribunal.
we
say
that
that
is
a
far
cry
from
a
union
sanction
because
there
the
individual
has
a
chance
to
go
to
an
impartial
tribunal
for
the
impartial
tribunal
to
make
a
judgment
to
whether
the
union
procedure
is
in
fact
adequate
and
then
can
remit
them.
if
on
the
other
hand
the
tribunal
is
satisfied
at
the
procedure
is
inadequate,
it
can
give
the
member
immediate
relief
without
requiring
the
member
to
guess
is
to
whether
or
not
he
has
got
a
situation
that
can
wait
or
can't
wait
if
he
guesses
wrong
union
discipline
sticks.
for
those
reason
we
submit
that
the
court
herein
denying
enforcement
to
the
board's
order
in
this
case.
