are
there
any

about

is
that
done
by

or
is

an
operation
like

justice

fortas
so
far
as
you
know
this
would
--
the
application
of
this
principle
for
which
you're
contending
would
be
confined
to
this
company?
justice
abe
fortas
by
the
common
carriers.
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
but
those
two
–
under
that,
those
are
the
only
ones
to
which
you
can
think
of
to
which
this
would
apply?
justice

fortas
well
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
corrigan,
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
you
again
but
i'm
concerned
because
there
is
a
short
difference
apparently
between
you
and
petitioner's
counsel.
the
--
his
brief
says
that
your
client
is
required
to
maintain
its
railroad
equipment
in
compliance
with
federal
safety
appliance
act.
you
say
that
is
not
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
you
said
just
the
opposite?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you're
subject
to
its
terms
as
a
matter
of
law
not
in
terms
of
business
partisans.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
i
should
read
this
it
is
required
in
petitioner's
brief
in
terms
of
a
business
matter?
justice
abe
fortas
and
next,
your
petitioner's
counsel
says
that
your
client
is
subject
to
the
railway
labor
act,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
railroad
retirement
act?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
railroad
unemployment
insurance
act?
justice
abe
fortas
all
right,

you.
