justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
werchich,
in
any
event,
whatever
may
have
been
the
employee's
duties
and
whatever
he
may
have
been
doing
at
the
time
he
was
injured,
your
hurdle
is
to
bring
this
company
within
the
phrase
common
carrier
by
railroad
under
the
statute,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
instantly,
may
i
ask
you
or
i
gather
that
another
employees
of
this
company
injured
at
work
at
some
time,
are
they
covered
by
workman's
compensation
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
but
for
injuries
on
the
job,
at
least
up
till
now
i
gather,
employees
of
this
company
have
had
to
resort
to
state
workman's
compensation,
have
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
you're
right
that
the
--
this
company
is
a
common
carrier
by
railroad,
they'd
no
longer
be
covered
by
state
workman's
compensation
but
would
be
remitted
to
their
remedy
under
the
fela,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
not
suggesting
you
do.
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
up
to
now
in
any
event
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
these
employees
for
work
connected
injuries
have
had
to
turn
to
state
workman's
compensation,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
are
the
standards
by
which
you
suggest
we
should
gauge
whether
this
company
is
a
“common
carrier
by
railroad”?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
language
is
common
carrier
by
railroad,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
and
you
said
--
you
say,
"all
you
have
to
show
was
that
it's
a
common
carrier
because
it
does
use
railroads".
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
how
--
why
do
you
say
it's
a
common
carrier?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
--
is
it
a
business
regulated
by
the
icc?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
these
are
--
are
the
rates
of
this
company
or
the
railroad
rates
that
are
regulated,
which?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
this
company
obliged
to
provide
these
cars
to
every
railroad
that
commands
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
know,
but
are
they
obliged
by
law
to
provide
the
penn
central
with
some
of
these
cars
if
the
penn
central
needs
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
they
licensed
as
common
carriers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
ordinarily
there
wasn't
--
there
was
something
rather
defined
about
how
you
bring
a
carrier
within
the
classification
of
common
carrier?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
am
--
didn't
we
have
a
--
we
had
a
terminal
case,
i
forgot
the
name,
i
think
it
was
(inaudible)
or
another
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
are
the
words
they
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
a
railroad
employee
was
injured
on
a
dining
car
or
something
while
the
car
was
in
the
terminal
and
the
injury
was
brought
about
because
one
of
the
terminal
switching
engines
have
struck
the
dining
car.
but
there
as
i
recall
it
we
turned
it
on
the
question
whether
a
vital
part
of
the
operation
of
the
railroad
had
been
turned
over
by
the
railroad
companies
that
set
up
the
union
terminal.
i
forgot
the
name
of
that,
(inaudible)
was
it,
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
that
it
seems
to
happen
here
is
that
the
railroads
want
--
they
want
to
provide
a
refrigerated
car
service,
instead
of
manufacturing
or
buying
their
own
refrigerated
cars,
lease
them
or
how
do
they
get
them?
some
way
they
contract
for
them
from
this
company,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
you
have
to
prove.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
start,
do
you
remember
that
name
of
the
case
that
i'm
trying
make
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
do
you
have
--
you
don't
cite
it.
do
you
have
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
sinkler
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you
very
much.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
that
been
challenged
before
this?
i
mean,
this
coverage
under
workman's
compensation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
what
--
is
that
--
reading
here,
i
--
now
i
recall
it
but
we
said
in
sinkler
it
was.
its
manifest
that
the
corporate
autonomy
of
the
belt
railroad
and
its
freedom
from
detailed
supervision
of
its
operations
by
respondent
there,
the
missouri
pacific,
are
irrelevant
in
as
much
as
the
switching
(inaudible)
of
the
belt
railway
at
the
moment
of
the
collision
in
the
station
was
engaged
in
furthering
the
operational
activities
of
respondent.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
can't
turnover
--
you
can't
escape
it
by
turning
over
operational
activities
to
somebody
else.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
say
that's
not
what's
done
here
under
this
arrangement
between
this
railroad
and
the
respondent
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
mr.
corrigan,
when
the
railway
express
agency,
i
don't
think
it's
any
longer
just
confined
to
railway
express,
i
think
that
they
do
general
express
business
now.
but
when
they
used
the
just
--
an
adjunct
to
the
railroads,
as
i
recall
it
railway
express
agency
was
owned,
lock,
stock
and
barrel
by
the
railroad,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
they
used
to
have
cars,
do
they
not,
their
own
cars?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
did
they
sometimes
have
their
own
employees
working
on
their
cars?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
were
there
employees
within
or
without
the
fela?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
no
question
that
railway
express
agency
was
a
common
carrier?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
was
not
a
common
carrier
by
railroad.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
that
--
was
that
uniformly
the
holding
as
to
railway
express
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
agency
employees?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
the
safety
appliance
act
to
get
to
the
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
--
would
it
be
liable
to
an
employee
of
your
company
who
happened
to
be
aboard
the
car
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
your
company
at
the
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
year,--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
ask
you
this
way
first.
perhaps,
do
you
ever
have
situations
where
employees
of
your
company,
pacific
fruit
express
company,
are
aboard
cars
of
pacific
fruit
express
company
while
in
transit
on
a
railroad?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
never
did.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
now
suppose
you
had
a
defect
in
violation
of
safety
appliance
act
in
the
yard?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
mr.
corrigan,
i've
read
this
12
to
14,
wasn't
that
colloquy
limited
to
the
pullman
company
employees
and
express
company
employees
with
those
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
was
there
any
special
reference
to
refrigerator
car
company
in
for
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
sentilles
i
think?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
actually,
i
gather
looking
at
sinkler.
there
i
think
you're
right.
the
employee
who
was
injured
who
was
an
employee
of
the
missouri
pacific,
but
his
injury
was
brought
about
by
the
negligence
of
the
employee
of
the
terminal
company.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
problem
was
whether
the
terminal
company
was
an
agent
of
the
missouri
pacific
within
the
word
agents
in
the
act,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
said
that
the
railroad
couldn't
delegate
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
operational
activity
there
involved
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
another
company
and
escape
liability
to
its
employee
injured
by
the
negligence
of
an
employee
of
the
other
company
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
wasn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
here
as
i
understand
it
though,
here
what
we
have
is
not
so
much
that.
the
question
here
is
as
it
might
have
been
there,
whether
or
not
if
the
employee
of
the
belt
railway
had
been
injured.
the
belt
railway
was
a
common
carrier
by
railroad.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
isn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
do
you
do
with
the
railway
express
and
the
pullman
and
the
freight
forwarders
and
all
those?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
how
are
those
different
from
this
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
railway
express
as
i
recall
it
used
to
have
any
number
of
its
own
cars,
owned
by
it,
carried
by
the
railroads,
and
manned
by
railway
express
employees.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
werchich,
in
any
event,
whatever
may
have
been
the
employee's
duties
and
whatever
he
may
have
been
doing
at
the
time
he
was
injured,
your
hurdle
is
to
bring
this
company
within
the
phrase
common
carrier
by
railroad
under
the
statute,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
instantly,
may
i
ask
you
or
i
gather
that
another
employees
of
this
company
injured
at
work
at
some
time,
are
they
covered
by
workman's
compensation
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
but
for
injuries
on
the
job,
at
least
up
till
now
i
gather,
employees
of
this
company
have
had
to
resort
to
state
workman's
compensation,
have
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
you're
right
that
the
--
this
company
is
a
common
carrier
by
railroad,
they'd
no
longer
be
covered
by
state
workman's
compensation
but
would
be
remitted
to
their
remedy
under
the
fela,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
not
suggesting
you
do.
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
up
to
now
in
any
event
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
these
employees
for
work
connected
injuries
have
had
to
turn
to
state
workman's
compensation,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
are
the
standards
by
which
you
suggest
we
should
gauge
whether
this
company
is
a
“common
carrier
by
railroad”?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
language
is
common
carrier
by
railroad,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
and
you
said
--
you
say,
"all
you
have
to
show
was
that
it's
a
common
carrier
because
it
does
use
railroads".
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
how
--
why
do
you
say
it's
a
common
carrier?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
--
is
it
a
business
regulated
by
the
icc?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
these
are
--
are
the
rates
of
this
company
or
the
railroad
rates
that
are
regulated,
which?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
this
company
obliged
to
provide
these
cars
to
every
railroad
that
commands
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
know,
but
are
they
obliged
by
law
to
provide
the
penn
central
with
some
of
these
cars
if
the
penn
central
needs
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
they
licensed
as
common
carriers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
ordinarily
there
wasn't
--
there
was
something
rather

about
how

justice
william

was

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
am
--
didn't
we
have
a
--
we
had
a
terminal
case,
i
forgot
the
name,
i
think
it
was
(inaudible)
or
another
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
are
the
words
they
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
a
railroad
employee
was
injured
on
a
dining
car
or
something
while
the
car
was
in
the
terminal
and
the
injury
was
brought
about
because
one
of
the
terminal
switching

have
struck

there
as

i
forgot
the
name
of
that,
(inaudible)
was

or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
that
it
seems
to
happen
here
is
that
the

william

before
you
start,
do
you
remember
that
name
of
the
case
that
i'm
trying
make
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
do
you
have
--
you
don't
cite
it.
do
you
have
the

justice
william
j.
brennan,

sinkler
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you
very
much.
justice
william

has
that
been

i

was
not
a
common

by

justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
is
that
--

uniformly
the

agency
employees?

how
about
the
safety

to
get

the
(voice

--
justice
william
j.

the
--
would
it
be
liable
to
an
employee
of
your
company
who
happened
to
be
aboard
the
car
--
justice
william

--
of
your
company
at
the
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
year,--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
ask
you
this
way
first.
perhaps,
do
you
ever
have
situations
where
employees
of
your
company,
pacific
fruit
express
company,
are
aboard
cars
of
pacific
fruit
express
company
while
in
transit
on
a
railroad?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
never
did.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
now
suppose
you
had
a
defect
in
violation
of
safety
appliance
act
in
the
yard?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
mr.
corrigan,
i've
read
this
12
to
14,
wasn't
that
colloquy
limited
to
the
pullman
company
employees
and
express
company
employees
with
those
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
was
there
any
special
reference
to
refrigerator
car
company
in
for
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
sentilles
i
think?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
actually,
i
gather
looking
at
sinkler.
there
i
think
you're
right.
the
employee
who
was
injured
who
was
an
employee
of
the
missouri
pacific,
but
his
injury
was
brought
about
by
the
negligence
of
the
employee
of
the
terminal
company.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
problem
was
whether
the
terminal
company
was
an
agent
of
the
missouri
pacific
within
the
word
agents
in
the
act,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
said
that
the
railroad
couldn't
delegate
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
operational
activity
there
involved
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
another
company
and
escape
liability
to
its
employee
injured
by
the
negligence
of
an
employee
of
the
other
company
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
wasn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
here
as
i
understand
it
though,
here
what
we
have
is
not
so
much
that.
the
question
here
is
as
it
might
have
been
there,
whether
or
not
if
the
employee
of
the
belt
railway
had
been
injured.
the
belt
railway
was
a
common
carrier
by
railroad.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
isn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
do
you
do
with
the
railway
express
and
the
pullman
and
the
freight
forwarders
and
all
those?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
how
are
those
different
from
this
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
railway
express
as
i
recall
it
used
to
have
any
number
of
its
own
cars,
owned
by
it,
carried
by
the
railroads,
and
manned
by
railway
express
employees.
