they've

where

would

the

well
supposes

justice

black
would
the

injured?
justice

black
any
employee,
it's
on
this
--
doing
his
work.
justice

and
there's
a
defective
brake.
justice

black
would
anybody
be
liable?
would
the
railroad
or
the
company?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
what
about
the
railroad?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
not
that
a
non-delegable
duty?
is
a
duty
to
keep
those
brakes
so
they'll
be
working?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
would
not
be
liable
to
the
others
if
they
were
there
on
the
basis
that
it's
a
non-delegable
duty?
justice

what
did
the

decided
then?
justice

is
that
all
it
held?

am

the

case
has
been

pretty
severe
criticism
since
that
time?

and
i'd
like
to
ask
you
this
one
more
question.
i
hate
to
take
up
your
time.
you
do
not
have
here
the
case
of
a
car
injury
from
a
defective
appliance?
justice

so
that
i
would
suppose,
maybe
your
best
answer
to
that
would
be
that
you
don't
have
that
case.
but
suppose
you
had
it,
why
would
not
the
sinkler
case
apply?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
we
held,
i
maybe
wrong,
i
had
read
it.
but
i
thought
we
held
that
that
power
could
not
be
delegated
so
he
became
an
employee
of
the
railroad
for
the
purposes
of
that
case?
justice

yes.

was
another
