mr.
werchick,
any
employees
of
pacific
fruit
touched
these
cars
after
they
leave
the
premises?
justice
thurgood
marshall
physically
touched.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
those
facilities
are
owned
and
operated
by
pacific
fruit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
did
they
ever
touch
the
car
or
property
that
is
not
the
property
of
pacific
fruit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
how
did
they
get
in
commerce?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
did
the
employees,
they're
not
in
commerce
are
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
there
was
a
switching
accident,
it
would
be
an
employee
of
a
railroad
that
would
be
injured,
wouldn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
talking
about
when
they're
on
the
line
of
the
southern
pacific,
and
one
of
these
cars
injures
an
employee,
it
would
be
an
employee
of
the
railroad.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
wouldn't
be
a
pacific
fruit
employee.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
man
is
off
of
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
he's
on
the
line
of
the
pacific,
southern
pacific
railroads.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
one
to
point
his
wording.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
pacific
fruit
says
that
these
yards
are
huge
and
your
area
is
small.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
saying
i
agree
with
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
how
about
these
railroads,
some
of
them
have
their
own
icing
operations.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
they
under
fela?
i
would
think
they
are.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
does
pacific
fruit
express
carry
by
rail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
rail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
many
miles
of
track
do
they
have?
justice
thurgood
marshall
one
and
a
half
square
miles
of
rail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
makes
them
a
carrier
by
rail.
justice
thurgood
marshall
pacific
express.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
terminal
does
more
than
wash
cars.
it
moves
cars,
box
them
up,
switches
them.
the
individual
employee
was
injured
while
the
car
was
being
washed,
but
it
was
no
question
that
the
terminal
railroad
was
a
railroad.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
difference
between
a
fruit
expressed
car
and
pullman
car
insofar
as
being
moved
by
rail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
then
you
disagree
with
the
pullman
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
