mr.
arne
werchick
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
action
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
was
halted
in
its
infancy
when
summary
judgment
was
granted
against
petitioner
in
the
district
court.
the
judgment
was
granted
in
favor
of
respondent
pacific
fruit
express,
the
district
court
saying
that
respondent
was
not
a
common
carrier
by
railroad
and
therefore
not
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
this
judgment
explicitly
construing
the
coverage
of
the
act
narrowly
and
stating
so
in
its
opinion,
briefed
opinion
as
specifically
rejecting
what
it
termed
a
broader
definition
of
the
terms
of
the
act.
this
court
granted
certiorari.
the
issue
essentially
before
this
court
is
the
question
of
coverage
under
the
employers'
liability
act
and
whether
it
is
to
be
decided
as
this
court
has
approached
similar
questions
of
coverage
and
also
the
general
application
of
this
act
in
the
past
or
whether
the
question
of
coverage
is
to
be
given
a
new
and
narrow
technical
meaning.
facts
of
this
suit
as
it
come
to
this
court
are
not
in
dispute.
it
is
essentially
conceded.
the
petitioner
was
employed
by
the
respondent.
he
was
injured
on
the
job.
he
was
working
in
roseville,
california
on
the
yards
of
the
--
that
are
operated
by
the
respondent.
it
is
a
large
refrigerator
car
icing
operation.
the
facts,
of
course,
describing
the
specifics
of
the
operation
are
set
out
in
great
detail
on
the
record
on
the
briefs
and
i
will
refer
to
some
of
them
as
i
proceed,
but
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
take
the
court's
time
to
set
out
all
of
the
facts
relating
to
the
description
of
respondent's
operation.
sufficed
to
say
at
this
point
that
it
is
not
disputed,
in
fact
it
is
set
forth
in
respondent's
affidavit
in
the
record
that
petitioner's
job
involved
the
servicing
of
railroad,
refrigerator
boxcars,
placing
of
ice,
loading
and
unloading
of
ice
and
heaters,
and
other
equipment
in
and
out
of
refrigerator
boxcars,
for
the
purpose
of
making
these
boxcars
able
to
carry
perishable
commodities
in
interstate
commerce.
and
about
this,
it
does
not
seem
to
be
any
dispute
in
the
record.
regarding
this
--
the
factual
description
of
pacific
fruit
express,
there
is
also
very
little
disagreement.
the
disagreement
between
the
parties
here
before
this
court
seems
to
be
the
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
this
description.
respondent
is
described
with
partial
accuracy
as
a
refrigerator
car
company.
and
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
statistical
reports
with
also
--
with
partial
accuracy
as
a
private
car
line.
respondent
is
owned
wholly
by
two
rail
haul
lines,
southern
pacific
and
union
pacific
railroads.
in
fact,
it
is
more
than
a
car
company
because
it
owns
some
roughly
25,000
boxcars,
refrigerator
boxcars
and
is
the
largest
owner
and
operator
of
these
cars
in
the
united
states.
it
dominates
what
might
be
called
the
refrigerator
car
company
industry
or
branch
of
the
railroad
industry
if
you
will.
it
represents
basically
half
of
that
industry
in
terms
of
the
number
of
employees,
its
holding
in
refrigerator
cars
alike.
there
are
seven
such
companies
in
the
united
states,
all
of
them
owned
by
rail
haul
carriers
and
operated
to
service.
the
obligations
of
those
rail
haul
carriers
that
they're
required
by
law
to
provide
the
care
necessary
to
ship
perishables
by
railroad
in
the
united
states.
there
are
about
one
million
carloads
of
perishable
commodities
shipped
in
the
united
states
each
year
and
respondent
in
their
words
originates
and
otherwise
handles
about
285,000
carloads,
or
approximately
almost
30%
of
the
nation's
total.
respondent
describes
itself
in
this
record
as
in
materials
in
this
record
as
the
nation's
largest
operator
of
refrigerator
railcars.
and
in
1965,
pfe
cars
moved
over
one
billion
miles.
mr.
arne
werchick
in
this
instance,
pacific
fruit
express
services
its
own
cars.
and
servicing
consists
--
before
the
trip
begins,
mr.
chief
justice,
taking
a
car
and
making
it
ready.
in
fact
pacific
fruit
express
builds
the
car
in
many
instances.
maintains
the
car
as
required
by
law
to
keep
its
cars
in
condition
to
comply
with
the
federal
safety
appliance
acts,
which
it
does
sometimes
itself
and
sometimes
by
paying
another
railcar
repair
installation
to
do
the
work
for
them.
pacific
fruit
express
takes
the
car
and
prepares
it
for
service
by
cleaning
it,
by
taking
it
to
its
various
plants
located
in
different
parts
of
the
west.
seven,
i
think
it
is
major
plants
and
several
icing
stations
different
points
in
the
country.
and
then
places
the
necessary
refrigerator
or
heater
equipment
in
this
car
and
then
makes
it
available
to
a
line
haul
railroad
so
that
it
can
be
taken
out
in
commodities
loaded
in.
and
now
this
is
not
where
the
service
stops
however
because,
pacific
fruit
express
is
paid
by
the
mile
that
the
car
is
used
and
provides
continuous
service
over
this
car
putting
ice
in
it
wherever
needed
at
its
various
stations
across
the
united
states
or
altering
the
character
of
the
service.
the
shipper
may
call
pacific
fruit
express
directly
to
alter
the
character
of
the
service.
they
invite
this
in
their
advertising
literature.
they
list
in
the
telephone
directories.
and
pacific
fruit
express
keeps
their
cars
spotted
all
the
way
across
the
united
states
and
can
order
them
diverted.
the
shipper
request
this,
nor
sent
to
chicago
and
if
the
shipper
wants
it
to
go
to
los
angeles
instead,
the
shipper
is
invited
to
call
pfe.
it
is
not
told
to
call
the
line
--
haul
line
necessarily.
he
can
call
either,
and
pfe
will
have
that
car
diverted.
they
give
the
necessary
instruction
and
the
car
will
be
diverted.
mr.
arne
werchick
pacific
fruit
express
maintains
several
repair
shops
of
its
own,
in
which
it
repairs
its
own
cars
and
cars
of
other
car
companies,
rail
companies,
and
the
like
if
paid
the
standard
rates
set
by
the
american
association
of
railroads.
they
will
also,
if
their
car
happens
to
be
located
in
an
area
which
is
not
near
one
of
their
own
shops
but
requires
repairs,
pay
the
standard
rates
to
another
railroad
company
or
repair
company
to
do
the
repairs
in
their
shop.
as
it
can
be
seen
from
the
record,
pacific
fruit
express
not
only
owns
but
controls,
operates,
and
services
this
largest
freight
of
refrigerator
railcars
and
trailers
in
the
united
states.
their
business
revolves
around
the
roughly
25,000
cars
that
it
owns.
but
according
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
reports
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
pacific
fruit
express
also
rents
cars
from
southern
pacific
and
union
pacific
to
add
to
its
fleet.
now
pacific
fruit
express,
as
i
indicated,
places
these
cars
in
rail
service
by
providing
them
to
any
line
haul
railroad
in
the
united
states.
they
are
not
private
contract
line
had
dealing
only
with
say
one
carrier,
one
other
carrier
being
completely
subsumed
to
one
part
of
the
business,
but
rather
will
deal
with
any
part
of
the
public
and
any
part
of
the
railroad
community,
and
making
their
cars
available
and
in
providing
protective
services.
they
do
this
by
charging
approximately
5
cents
per
mile.
they
do
not
charge,
with
very
rare
exception,
for
term
use
of
the
car.
occasionally,
according
to
their
literature,
they
will
rent
some
cars
to
a
shipper
on
a
monthly
basis.
this
is
what
i
would
call
--
concede
would
be
the
renting
or
leasing
of
a
refrigerator
railcar.
but
i
would
maintain
that
insofar
as
it
is
a
standard
in
the
refrigerator
car
business
to
charge
by
the
mile
that
a
car
is
used,
this
indicates
a
carriage
activity
that's
going
on
a
transportation
activity,
which
as
i
would
like
to
suggest
later
is
crucial
in
applying
with
federal
employers'
liability
act.
pacific
fruit
express
does
more
in
controlling
the
distribution
of
the
cars
because
they
also
do
market
research.
they
also
go
out
and
survey
the
agricultural
needs
in
the
areas
early
in
order
to
determine
how
many
cars
will
be
needed.
they
discuss
with
shippers
where
cars
have
to
be
provided
and
where
they'll
be
needed.
mr.
arne
werchick
well,
in
one
sense
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
--
mr.
arne
werchick
yes.
let
us
say
that
a
car
has
started
from
san
francisco
to
chicago.
they
have
icing
stations
and
facilities
between
san
francisco
and
chicago
and
the
--
mr.
arne
werchick
that's
right.
mr.
arne
werchick
as
far
as
i
know,
they
do
not.
mr.
arne
werchick
how
does
pacific
fruit
express
get
in
commerce
or
how
--
mr.
arne
werchick
the
employees
themselves,
yes,
your
honor.
the
employees
are
in
interstate
commerce.
the
test
that
this
court
has
established
many
times
in
the
language
of
the
federal
employees
liability
act
itself
specifically
establishes
this,
does
the
activity
of
the
employee
substantially
affect
interstate
commerce.
if
you
took
him
away,
would
you
halt
or
disrupt
the
interstate
commerce?
i
can
--
i
think
best
cite
to
the
court
is
reed
versus
pennsylvania
decision
which
this
court
established
where
a
clerical
employee
who
handled
blueprints
sitting
in
an
office
was
found
to
substantially
affect
interstate
commerce
because
--
mr.
arne
werchick
not
necessarily
at
all.
these
cars
have
to
be
switched
on
and
off
of
the
pacific
fruit
express
terminal,
your
honor.
mr.
arne
werchick
well,
i
couldn't
say
whether
that
would
always
be
the
case
or
not.
mr.
arne
werchick
i
--
each
--
it
ordinarily,
as
i
understand
it
at
least
in
california
pacific
fruit
express
has
its
own
yards
which
are
adjacent
to
or
part
of
other
railroad
industry
set
up.
so
that
they
can
provide
immediate
icing
service
whenever
the
car
is
needed
or
immediate
heating
service
or
repair
service
to
refrigerator
cars.
mr.
arne
werchick
by
--
mr.
arne
werchick
my
understanding
is
that
there
would
be
no
reason
for
a
pacific
fruit
express
employee
to
be
out
on
the
tracks
in
the
middle
of
kansas
or
what
have
you
as
the
train
is
moving
from
here
to
--
from
san
francisco
to
chicago,
from
here
to
chicago.
mr.
arne
werchick
i
would
--
if
i
may
add
to
that
statement
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
that
it's
important
to
consider
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
other
courts
which
should
be
confirmly
established
in
the
area
of
terminal,
belt
and
yard
companies.
they
have
been
held
to
be
within
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
and
yet
there
will
be
no
terminal
employee
on
the
train
as
it's
traversing
the
united
states.
in
fact,
it
may
never
even
be
a
terminal
employee
on
the
train
per
se.
i
had
occasion
to
have
reference
to
some
of
the
cases
which
are
cited
in
our
brief.
one
particular
come
--
coming
from
florida,
their
district
court
where
all
the
employee
there
did
was
wash
the
trains
apparently.
somebody
else
for
the
terminal
company
directed
the
movement
of
the
train
once
it
entered
the
terminal
facility.
and
then
what
they
did
they
washed
it,
and
cleaned
it,
and
made
it
ready
for
the
next
journey.
mr.
arne
werchick
well
--
mr.
arne
werchick
they
also
say
in
their
literature
that
their
yard
in
roseville
is
1
1/2
square
miles.
and
i
maintain
that
that's
fairly
sizeable
railroad
installation.
the
train
stations
in
most
of
our
communities
don't
cover
much
more
than
that,
i
don't
think
sizably
less
in
many
of
the
smaller
communities,
i
would
say.
mr.
arne
werchick
they
own
--
mr.
arne
werchick
excuse
me.
mr.
arne
werchick
in
this
case,
the
employee
was
injured
while
he
was
operating
a
motor
vehicle.
and
he
was
going
from
one
part
of
the
icing
yard
to
an
icing
dock.
he
was
not
injured
on
a
railroad
car
itself.
but
his
work
and
the
work
in
which
he
was
engaged
did
specifically
involved
the
making
of
railroad
cars
ready
for
interstate
commerce.
now
again
under
the
decisions
which
this
court
has
decided
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
that
this
does
not
seem
to
be
required.
plainly,
it
does
not
seem
to
be
required
that
the
employee
must
be
working
on
a
railroad
car
when
he
sustains
his
injury,
that
was
--
mr.
arne
werchick
yes.
mr.
arne
werchick
it
is
my
understanding
that
this
company
is
covered
by
california
workman's
compensation
statute
but
also
by
the
federal
railway
labor
act,
federal
railroad
unemployment
insurance
act
and
federal
railroad
act.
mr.
arne
werchick
yes,
although
--
mr.
arne
werchick
that's
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
however,
i
don't
have
any
reluctance
to
urge
that
position
of
congress
having
declared
that
that's
the
appropriate
remedy.
mr.
arne
werchick
yes
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arne
werchick
that's
correct
sir.
now
turning
to
the
question
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arne
werchick
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
my
understanding
that
they
either
do
the
repairs
or
pay
someone
for
them
--
mr.
arne
werchick
--
but
repairs
are
not
provided
free
to
them
or
assumed
it
by
somebody
else.
mr.
arne
werchick
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
arne
werchick
or
some
other
car
repair
--
mr.
arne
werchick
--
company
whoever
might
do
car
repairs
at
that
area,
yes.
mr.
arne
werchick
this
company
was
--
went
into
operation
six
months
after
the
first
employers'
liability
act
was
passed
in
1906,
and
that
act
was
declared
unconstitutional.
mr.
arne
werchick
well,
i
don't
--
i
think
california
adapted
the
compensation
act
early
in
the
20s.
i'm
not
sure
about
that
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
arne
werchick
no,
there
have
been
attempts
in
the
lower
courts.
these
attempts
were
defeated
on
essentially
the
same
basis
that
we
now
come
to
this
court.
reference
was
had
to
--
earlier
expressed
prior
decisions
and
some
peripheral
decisions,
early
ones
by
this
court
under
the
fela.
and
in
this
area
alone,
as
far
as
i
can
see,
a
narrow
standard
was
adapted
for
coverage
by
the
lower
courts
which
we
attack
is
inappropriate
now
before
this
court.
mr.
arne
werchick
not
refrigerated
car
companies,
no.
there've
been
no
mentions
of
refrigerator
car
companies
insofar
as
any
discussions
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
they're
concerned
in
congress.
mr.
arne
werchick
well
i
think
first
of
all,
mr.
justice
brennan,
you
could
just
take
the
phrase
itself
if
they're
a
common
carrier
and
they
act
by
means
of
rails
--
mr.
arne
werchick
that's
right.
but
as
--
i
think
that
perhaps
most
clearly
pointed
out,
i
believe
it
was
the
hammarstrom
decision,
which
is
cited
in
our
briefs
in
missouri
appellate
court
that
the
language
is
simply
stated.
the
words
by
railroad
referred
to
nothing
but
the
instrumentality,
the
type
of
industry
that
congress
was
talking
about.
there's
no
magic
to
the
phrase
by
railroad.
it
refers
in
fact
in
the
early
days
the
word
used
to
be
used
to
mean
nothing
but
a
highway,
a
particular
type
of
road,
only
this
was
a
steel
road
rather
than
a
concrete
one.
mr.
arne
werchick
right,
either
it
uses
nothing
but
--
mr.
arne
werchick
it
is
certainly
common
or
public
in
its
structure.
it
deals
with
all
railroads,
all
line
haul
railroads
indiscriminately.
mr.
arne
werchick
its
rates,
in
a
sense,
essentially
they
regulate
it.
they
must
file
--
mr.
arne
werchick
the
contracts
between
the
railroads
and
the
so-called
private
car
companies
must
be
filed
and
approved
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
do
not
become
effective
until
approved.
they
have
since
1940,
have
the
authority
to
command
these
companies
to
turn
over
their
books,
provide
information
and
cooperate
in
investigations
so
that
they
can
determine
what
the
rates
should
be.
now,
they
have
a
central
rulemaking
power
over
the
rates
and
practices
of
refrigerator
car
line.
mr.
arne
werchick
they
so
indicate
in
their
affidavit
which
is
filed
that
they
will
provide
these
cars
to
any
railroad.
mr.
arne
werchick
i
believe
this
may
be
more
by
custom
in
the
industry.
i
don't
know
whether
the
law
has
in
fact
had
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
one
car
company
must
provide
its
cars
to
all
other
railroads.
they
just
do
it
and
always
have
done
it.
mr.
arne
werchick
i
don't
believe
so.
well,
they
can't
deny
their
common
of
public
calling.
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
there're
such
things
as
their
advertising
where
they
talk
about
to
the
public
“just
call
us.
we'll
take
care
of
these
services
anywhere
on
the
west”.
they
list
in
telephone
directories
all
over
the
united
states
under
the
heading
“railroads”.
they
describe
themselves
--
mr.
arne
werchick
no.
i
--
mr.
arne
werchick
the
only
language
of
this
court
on
that
subject,
mr.
justice
brennan,
has
been
the
statement
that
they
need
not
hold
themselves
out
to
the
public
at
all
and
can
still
be
a
common
carrier.
that
if
they
perform
a
vital
transportation
service
in
railroad
transportation,
that
makes
them
a
common
carrier
by
railroad.
and
i
have
reference
to
the
terminal
company
and
the
stockyard
and
beltline
railroad
cases.
the
fact
that
they
acted
as
agent
for
a
common
carrier
line
haul
operation
and
took
some
of
the
burden
from
the
shoulders
of
that
railroad
and
in
the
sense
divided
up
the
labor,
made
them
part
of
a
system
of
common
carriage
by
railroad.
this
concept
goes
back
as
far
as
the
southern
pacific
terminal
case
of
--
i
think
1908
where
a
terminal
that
did
nothing
but
provide
normal
terminal
facilities
and
wharfage
was
held
to
be
under
the
interstate
commerce
commission
jurisdiction
because
the
court
at
that
early
stage
said,
“you
can't
allow
railroads
to
go
out
dividing
up
into
small
parts
(voice
overlap)
control”.
mr.
arne
werchick
pardon?
mr.
arne
werchick
three
years
ago?
mr.
arne
werchick
it
doesn't
come
immediately
in
my
mind,
your
honor.
here,
there's
no
question
to
the
vital
part
of
a
railroad
operation
that
has
been
turned
over
to
pacific
fruit
express.
the
railroads
are
required
by
law
to
provide
--
mr.
arne
werchick
--
its
refrigerated
service.
mr.
arne
werchick
precisely,
instead
of
buying
them
themselves
because
they
would
be
legally
obligated
to
do
and
servicing
and
operating
them
and
controlling
them
and
maintaining
them
and
repairing
them
and
building
them
themselves,
they've
setup
a
separate
company
to
do
this
under
a
separate
incorporation,
but
is
doing
nothing
but
the
business
of
the
railroad
is
legally
compelled
to
do.
mr.
arne
werchick
no.
mr.
arne
werchick
that
--
mr.
justice
white,
this
company
is
a
common
carrier.
mr.
arne
werchick
it
--
mr.
arne
werchick
the
degree
of
involvement
in
the
interstate
transportation
of
goods
is
essentially
what
it
is.
if
a
company
merely
builds
cars
and
sells
or
rents
them
on
a
term
basis
maintaining
no
control
and
not
operating
them
and
not
getting
into
the
carriage
business
itself,
it's
obviously
not
a
carrier
because
it's
not
creating
risks
and
hazards
in
the
railroad
industry
in
that
sense.
but
this
company
is
doing
a
part
of
the
active
transportation
work
from
the
carriage
of
goods.
mr.
arne
werchick
no
they're
not,
not
generally
unless
they
were
to
--
separate
terminal
operations.
mr.
arne
werchick
yes
your
honor
but
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief
--
mr.
arne
werchick
no,
as
i
put
it
on
my
brief,
they
stand
in
the
relation
of
--
to
the
carrier
as
basically
a
shipper.
they're
nothing
but
a
bulk
shipper
collecting
the
smaller
parcels
from
the
individual
shippers
and
putting
them
together
in
a
large
package
and
delivering
them
to
the
railroad.
if
you
took
them
away
from
the
railroad
industry,
the
industry
would
go
on
as
it
is,
except
the
shipper
would
have
the
problem
having
to
get
his
goods
down
to
the
station
himself,
the
same
with
the
express
company.
but
you
if
take
away
the
refrigerator
car
operation,
there's
just
not
going
to
be
any
shipment
of
fruits
or
vegetables
or
other
perishables
in
the
united
states.
mr.
arne
werchick
i
think
mr.
justice
fortas
that
it's
done
more
--
with
my
understanding
and
i'm
not
as
informed
in
that
area,
i'm
talking
at
the
top
of
my
head
but
i
think
it's
done
more
by
standard
lease
to
the
line
haul
carrier.
and
i
think
the
line
haul
carrier
is
offering
--
mr.
arne
werchick
that
it
might
overlapping
to
the
area
--
i
see
that
as
a
transportation
service
--
mr.
arne
werchick
alright
mr.
arne
werchick
yes.
i
don't
think
it
need
to
apply
any
further
than
this.
mr.
arne
werchick
i'd
start
to
point
out
that
under
california
public
utilities
code
211
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
the
word
common
carrier
under
california
law
specifically
includes
refrigerator
and
car
renting
corporations.
secondly,
the
question
of
federal
safety
appliance
act,
the
safety
appliance
act
is
directed
to
the
vehicles
themselves,
to
the
instrumentalities.
in
your
decision
of
the
united
states
versus
california,
this
court
said,
it
could
go
after
the
belt
line.
it
didn't
have
to
wait
until
it
got
on
to
a
full
line
haul
railroad
in
order
to
enforce
that
act
in
considering
that
decision
at
its
narrowest.
it
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
holder
of
the
vehicle
and
anytime
that
somebody
is
injured,
or
anytime
the
unsafe
practices
found
is
the
person
responsible.
this
is
perhaps
the
most
aptly
illustrated
in
the
florida
case
that
i
mentioned
earlier,
mccullough
versus
jacksonville
terminal
also
cited
in
the
briefs.
there,
the
terminal
company
did
nothing
with
the
car
except
clean
it.
they
moved
it
for
the
purpose
of
servicing
it.
it
was
defective
under
the
safety
appliance
act.
suit
was
brought
under
the
vehicle
of
the
fela.
and
recovery
was
allowed
even
though
there
was
no
transportation
involved
in
that
sense,
merely
the
cleaning
of
the
car
making
it
ready
for
transportation.
the
question
of
what
happens
if
the
railroad
divests
was
raised.
suppose
it
gives
away
what's
--
we
maintain
is
really
what
it's
doing
here.
and
this
is
answered
in
part
or
at
least
by
analogy
in
section
57
of
title
45
which
is
also
part
of
the
fela.
and
it
says
that
a
common
carrier
for
the
purpose
of
that
act
is
anybody,
a
receiver
or
a
lessee
or
anybody.
it
says
carrying
out
the
operations
of
a
common
carrier
by
railroad.
and
that
section
has
never
been
used
to
decide
a
coverage
case.
i
might
suggest
in
my
mind
that
it
might
be
perfectly
adequate
to
decide
coverage
cases
because
it
says
anybody
performing
the
function
of
a
common
carrier
by
railroad
and
it
doesn't
say
a
bit
of
the
function
of
a
whole
function.
mr.
arne
werchick
taking
the
two
cases
that
--
mr.
arne
werchick
they
don't
operate
by
railroad.
in
wells
fargo
which
is
the
leading
express
company
case
and
the
one
that's
responsible
for
so
many
of
these
coverage
questions
--
mr.
arne
werchick
in
the
railway
express
case,
it's
discussed
i
think
from
the
fifth
circuit,
i'm
not
sure
your
honor.
it
specifically
says
it
is
a
common
carrier
but
because
of
the
lack
of
railroad
equipment
it's
just
not
operating
by
railroad.
now
i
--
mr.
arne
werchick
the
pullman
company
is
an
anachronism
as
far
as
the
robinson
versus
baltimore
&
ohio
case.
but
robinson
merely
said,
he
couldn't
sue
b
&
o
because
he
was
employed
by
the
pullman
company.
he
was
not
an
employee
of
baltimore
&
ohio.and
the
fela
gives
a
remedy
only
to
an
employee
of
the
carrier.
that
was
an
agency
case
essentially
or
a
joint
servant
question.
now
granted
there
was
a
sort
of
an
assumption
that
stated
in
that
case
and
i
maintain
that
it's
not
a
valid
assumption
that
you
can
never
have
two
common
carriers
by
railroad
working
together.
mr.
arne
werchick
among
other
things,
they
carry
three
million
tons
of
ice
every
year.
mr.
arne
werchick
they
use
for
their
own
purposes.yes,
and
they
load
and
unload
it
at
their
yards
and
--
mr.
arne
werchick
that's
not
in
the
record,
enough
to
fill
up
one
and
a
half
square
miles
in
roseville
anyway.
mr.
arne
werchick
we
know
that
there's
an
--
there's
rail
running
back
and
forth
and
i
could
only
guess
--
mr.
arne
werchick
--
how
much
rail
there
is
at
roseville
alone.
mr.
arne
werchick
well
--
mr.
arne
werchick
yes,
your
honor.
on
the
same
sense
that
the
lone
star
steel
company
with
only
rail
inside
its
own
plant
or
a
terminal
company
that
only
has
a
railroad
station
where
it
washes
the
railroad
car
or
the
union
stockyard
company
which
does
nothing
but
unload
beef
is
a
common
carrier
by
rail.
mr.
arne
werchick
again
i
can
only
--
mr.
arne
werchick
i
--
not
as
i
read
the
mccullough
decision
in
that
particular
instance.
and
also
the
mccabe
versus
boston
terminal
where
they
had
no
tracks
of
their
own
--
i
mean
no
engines
of
their
own,
no
cars
of
their
own.
they
merely
gave
signals
to
the
engineer
to
move
the
car
one
way
or
another.
mr.
arne
werchick
i
think
they're
both
carriers
in
the
transportation
service
by
rail.
mr.
arne
werchick
robin
--
with
the
robinson
case?
mr.
arne
werchick
insofar
as
it
might
be
assumed
to
hold
that,
yes.
although
it
can
be
distinguished
as
an
agency
or
joint
employment
case,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
reached.
certainly
i
feel
that
that
is
definitely
carriage
and
transportation.
and
i
feel
that
mr.
willis
in
the
general
counsel
for
pullman
in
testifying
before
congress
in
1939
so
stated
but
then
made
an
artificial
distinction
that
they
weren't
a
common
carrier
even
though
the
icc
classifies
them
as
a
transportation
agency,
yes
sir.
mr.
arne
werchick
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
but
you
bring
them
within
the
federal
social
legislation
that
covers
this
railroad
industry
in
terms
of
pension
benefits
--
mr.
arne
werchick
--
and
injury
benefits
--
mr.
arne
werchick
--
but
yes.
mr.
arne
werchick
yes,
that's
the
alternative
to
workman's
compensation.
mr.
arne
werchick
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
action
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
was
halted
in
its
infancy
when
summary
judgment
was
granted
against
petitioner
in
the
district
court.
the
judgment
was
granted
in
favor
of
respondent
pacific
fruit
express,
the
district
court
saying
that
respondent
was
not
a
common
carrier
by
railroad
and
therefore
not
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
this
judgment
explicitly
construing
the
coverage
of
the
act
narrowly
and
stating
so
in
its
opinion,
briefed
opinion
as
specifically
rejecting
what
it
termed
a
broader
definition
of
the
terms
of
the
act.
this
court
granted
certiorari.
the
issue
essentially
before
this
court
is
the
question
of
coverage
under
the
employers'
liability
act
and
whether
it
is
to
be
decided
as
this
court
has
approached
similar
questions
of
coverage
and
also
the
general
application
of
this
act
in
the
past
or
whether
the
question
of
coverage
is
to
be
given
a
new
and
narrow
technical
meaning.
facts
of
this
suit
as
it
come
to
this
court
are
not
in
dispute.
it
is
essentially
conceded.
the
petitioner
was
employed
by
the
respondent.
he
was
injured
on
the
job.
he
was
working
in
roseville,
california
on
the
yards
of
the
--
that
are
operated
by
the
respondent.
it
is
a
large
refrigerator
car
icing
operation.
the
facts,
of
course,
describing
the
specifics
of
the
operation
are
set
out
in
great
detail
on
the
record
on
the
briefs
and
i
will
refer
to
some
of
them
as
i
proceed,
but
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
take
the
court's
time
to
set
out
all
of
the
facts
relating
to
the
description
of
respondent's
operation.
sufficed
to
say
at
this
point
that
it
is
not
disputed,
in
fact
it
is
set
forth
in
respondent's
affidavit
in
the
record
that
petitioner's
job
involved
the
servicing
of
railroad,
refrigerator
boxcars,
placing
of
ice,
loading
and
unloading
of
ice
and
heaters,
and
other
equipment
in
and
out
of
refrigerator
boxcars,
for
the
purpose
of
making
these
boxcars
able
to
carry
perishable
commodities
in
interstate
commerce.
and
about
this,
it
does
not
seem
to
be
any
dispute
in
the
record.
regarding
this
--
the
factual
description
of
pacific
fruit
express,
there
is
also
very
little
disagreement.
the
disagreement
between
the
parties
here
before
this
court
seems
to
be
the
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
this
description.
respondent
is
described
with
partial
accuracy
as
a
refrigerator
car
company.
and
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
statistical
reports
with
also
--
with
partial
accuracy
as
a
private
car
line.
respondent
is
owned
wholly
by
two
rail
haul
lines,
southern
pacific
and
union
pacific
railroads.
in
fact,
it
is
more
than
a
car
company
because
it
owns
some
roughly
25,000
boxcars,
refrigerator
boxcars
and
is
the
largest
owner
and
operator
of
these
cars
in
the
united
states.
it
dominates
what
might
be
called
the
refrigerator
car
company
industry
or
branch
of
the
railroad
industry
if
you
will.
it
represents
basically
half
of
that
industry
in
terms
of
the
number
of
employees,
its
holding
in
refrigerator
cars
alike.
there
are
seven
such
companies
in
the
united
states,
all
of
them
owned
by
rail
haul
carriers
and
operated
to
service.
the
obligations
of
those
rail
haul
carriers
that
they're
required
by
law
to
provide
the
care
necessary
to
ship
perishables
by
railroad
in
the
united
states.
there
are
about
one
million
carloads
of
perishable
commodities
shipped
in
the
united
states
each
year
and
respondent
in
their
words
originates
and
otherwise
handles
about
285,000
carloads,
or
approximately
almost
30%
of
the
nation's
total.
respondent
describes
itself
in
this
record
as
in
materials
in
this
record
as
the
nation's
largest
operator
of
refrigerator
railcars.
and
in
1965,
pfe
cars
moved
over
one
billion
miles.
mr.
arne
werchick
in
this
instance,
pacific
fruit
express
services
its
own
cars.
and
servicing
consists
--
before
the
trip
begins,
mr.
chief
justice,
taking
a
car
and
making
it
ready.
in
fact
pacific
fruit
express
builds
the
car
in
many
instances.
maintains
the
car
as
required
by
law
to
keep
its
cars
in
condition
to
comply
with
the
federal
safety
appliance
acts,
which
it
does
sometimes
itself
and
sometimes
by
paying
another
railcar
repair
installation
to
do
the
work
for
them.
pacific
fruit
express
takes
the
car
and
prepares
it
for
service
by
cleaning
it,
by
taking
it
to
its
various
plants
located
in
different
parts
of
the
west.
seven,
i
think
it
is
major
plants
and
several
icing
stations
different
points
in
the
country.
and
then
places
the
necessary
refrigerator
or
heater
equipment
in
this
car
and
then
makes
it
available
to
a
line
haul
railroad
so
that
it
can
be
taken
out
in
commodities
loaded
in.
and
now
this
is
not
where
the
service
stops
however
because,
pacific
fruit
express
is
paid
by
the
mile
that
the
car
is
used
and
provides
continuous
service
over
this
car
putting
ice
in
it
wherever
needed
at
its
various
stations
across
the
united
states
or
altering
the
character
of
the
service.
the
shipper
may
call
pacific
fruit
express
directly
to
alter
the
character
of
the
service.
they
invite
this
in
their
advertising
literature.
they
list
in
the
telephone
directories.
and
pacific
fruit
express
keeps
their
cars
spotted
all
the
way
across
the
united
states
and
can
order
them
diverted.
the
shipper
request
this,
nor
sent
to
chicago
and
if
the
shipper
wants
it
to
go
to
los
angeles
instead,
the
shipper
is
invited
to
call
pfe.
it
is
not
told
to
call
the
line
--
haul
line
necessarily.
he
can
call
either,
and
pfe
will
have
that
car
diverted.
they
give
the
necessary
instruction
and
the
car
will
be
diverted.
mr.
arne
werchick
pacific
fruit
express
maintains
several
repair
shops
of
its
own,
in
which
it
repairs
its
own
cars
and
cars
of
other
car
companies,
rail
companies,
and
the
like
if
paid
the
standard
rates
set
by
the
american
association
of
railroads.
they
will
also,
if
their
car
happens
to
be
located
in
an
area
which
is
not
near
one
of
their
own
shops
but
requires
repairs,
pay
the
standard
rates
to
another
railroad
company
or
repair
company
to
do
the
repairs
in
their
shop.
as
it
can
be
seen
from
the
record,
pacific
fruit
express
not
only
owns
but
controls,
operates,
and
services
this
largest
freight
of
refrigerator
railcars
and
trailers
in
the
united
states.
their
business
revolves
around
the
roughly
25,000
cars
that
it
owns.
but
according
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
reports
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
pacific
fruit
express
also
rents
cars
from
southern
pacific
and
union
pacific
to
add
to
its
fleet.
now
pacific
fruit
express,
as
i
indicated,
places
these
cars
in
rail
service
by
providing
them
to
any
line
haul
railroad
in
the
united
states.
they
are
not
private
contract
line
had
dealing
only
with
say
one
carrier,
one
other
carrier
being
completely
subsumed
to
one
part
of
the
business,
but
rather
will
deal
with
any
part
of
the
public
and
any
part
of
the
railroad
community,
and
making
their
cars
available
and
in
providing
protective
services.
they
do
this
by
charging
approximately
5
cents
per
mile.
they
do
not
charge,
with
very
rare
exception,
for
term
use
of
the
car.
occasionally,
according
to
their
literature,
they
will
rent
some
cars
to
a
shipper
on
a
monthly
basis.
this
is
what
i
would
call
--
concede
would
be
the
renting
or
leasing
of
a
refrigerator
railcar.
but
i
would
maintain
that
insofar
as
it
is
a
standard
in
the
refrigerator
car
business
to
charge
by
the
mile
that
a
car
is
used,
this
indicates
a
carriage
activity
that's
going
on
a
transportation
activity,
which
as
i
would
like
to
suggest
later
is
crucial
in
applying
with
federal
employers'
liability
act.
pacific
fruit
express
does
more
in
controlling
the
distribution
of
the
cars
because
they
also
do
market
research.
they
also
go
out
and
survey
the
agricultural
needs
in
the
areas
early
in
order
to
determine
how
many
cars
will
be
needed.
they
discuss
with
shippers
where
cars
have
to
be
provided
and
where
they'll
be
needed.
mr.
arne
werchick
well,
in
one
sense
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
--
mr.
arne
werchick
yes.
let
us
say
that
a
car
has
started
from
san
francisco
to
chicago.
they
have
icing
stations
and
facilities
between
san
francisco
and
chicago
and
the
--
mr.
arne
werchick
that's
right.
mr.
arne
werchick
as
far
as
i
know,
they
do
not.
mr.
arne
werchick
how
does
pacific
fruit
express
get
in
commerce
or
how
--
mr.
arne
werchick
the
employees
themselves,
yes,
your
honor.
the
employees
are
in
interstate
commerce.
the
test
that
this
court
has
established
many
times
in
the
language
of
the
federal
employees
liability
act
itself
specifically
establishes
this,
does
the
activity
of
the
employee
substantially
affect
interstate
commerce.
if
you
took
him
away,
would
you
halt
or
disrupt
the
interstate
commerce?
i
can
--
i
think
best
cite
to
the
court
is
reed
versus
pennsylvania
decision
which
this
court
established
where
a
clerical
employee
who
handled
blueprints
sitting
in
an
office
was
found
to
substantially
affect
interstate
commerce
because
--
mr.
arne
werchick
not
necessarily
at
all.
these
cars
have
to
be
switched
on
and
off
of
the
pacific
fruit
express
terminal,
your
honor.
mr.
arne
werchick
well,
i
couldn't
say
whether
that
would
always
be
the
case
or
not.
mr.
arne
werchick
i
--
each
--
it
ordinarily,
as
i
understand
it
at
least
in
california
pacific
fruit
express
has
its
own
yards
which
are
adjacent
to
or
part
of
other
railroad
industry
set
up.
so
that
they
can
provide
immediate
icing
service
whenever
the
car
is
needed
or
immediate
heating
service
or
repair
service
to
refrigerator
cars.
mr.
arne
werchick
by
--
mr.
arne
werchick
my
understanding
is
that
there
would
be
no
reason
for
a
pacific
fruit
express
employee
to
be
out
on
the
tracks
in
the
middle
of
kansas
or
what
have
you
as
the
train
is
moving
from
here
to
--
from
san
francisco
to
chicago,
from
here
to
chicago.
mr.
arne
werchick
i
would
--
if
i
may
add
to
that
statement
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
that
it's
important
to
consider
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
other
courts
which
should
be
confirmly
established
in
the
area
of
terminal,
belt
and
yard
companies.
they
have
been
held
to
be
within
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
and
yet
there
will
be
no
terminal
employee
on
the
train
as
it's
traversing
the
united
states.
in
fact,
it
may
never
even
be
a
terminal
employee
on
the
train
per
se.
i
had
occasion
to
have
reference
to
some
of
the
cases
which
are
cited
in
our
brief.
one
particular
come
--
coming
from
florida,
their
district
court
where
all
the
employee
there
did
was
wash
the
trains
apparently.
somebody
else
for
the
terminal
company
directed
the
movement
of
the
train
once
it
entered
the
terminal
facility.
and
then
what
they
did
they
washed
it,
and
cleaned
it,
and
made
it
ready
for
the
next
journey.
mr.
arne
werchick
well
--
mr.
arne
werchick
they
also
say
in
their
literature
that
their
yard
in
roseville
is
1
1/2
square
miles.
and
i
maintain
that
that's
fairly
sizeable
railroad
installation.
the
train
stations
in
most
of
our
communities
don't
cover
much
more
than
that,
i
don't
think
sizably
less
in
many
of
the
smaller
communities,
i
would
say.
mr.
arne
werchick
they
own
--
mr.
arne
werchick
excuse
me.
mr.
arne
werchick
in
this
case,
the
employee
was
injured
while
he
was
operating
a
motor
vehicle.
and
he
was
going
from
one
part
of
the
icing
yard
to
an
icing
dock.
he
was
not
injured
on
a
railroad
car
itself.
but
his
work
and
the
work
in
which
he
was
engaged
did
specifically
involved
the
making
of
railroad
cars
ready
for
interstate
commerce.
now
again
under
the
decisions
which
this
court
has
decided
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
that
this
does
not
seem
to
be
required.
plainly,
it
does
not
seem
to
be
required
that
the
employee
must
be
working
on
a
railroad
car
when
he
sustains
his
injury,
that
was
--
mr.
arne
werchick
yes.
mr.
arne
werchick
it
is
my
understanding
that
this
company
is
covered
by
california
workman's
compensation
statute
but
also
by
the
federal
railway
labor
act,
federal
railroad
unemployment
insurance
act
and
federal
railroad
act.
mr.
arne
werchick
yes,
although
--
mr.
arne
werchick
that's
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
however,
i
don't
have
any
reluctance
to
urge
that
position
of
congress
having
declared
that
that's
the
appropriate
remedy.
mr.
arne
werchick
yes
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arne
werchick
that's
correct
sir.
now
turning
to
the
question
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arne
werchick
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
my
understanding
that
they
either
do
the
repairs
or
pay
someone
for
them
--
mr.
arne
werchick
--
but
repairs
are
not
provided
free
to
them
or
assumed
it
by
somebody
else.
mr.
arne
werchick
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
arne
werchick
or
some
other
car
repair
--
mr.
arne
werchick
--
company
whoever
might
do
car
repairs
at
that
area,
yes.
mr.
arne
werchick
this
company
was
--
went
into
operation
six
months
after
the
first
employers'
liability
act
was
passed
in
1906,
and
that
act
was
declared
unconstitutional.
mr.
arne
werchick
well,
i
don't
--
i
think
california
adapted
the
compensation
act
early
in
the
20s.
i'm
not
sure
about
that
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
arne
werchick
no,
there
have
been
attempts
in
the
lower
courts.
these
attempts
were
defeated
on
essentially
the
same
basis
that
we
now
come
to
this
court.
reference
was
had
to
--
earlier
expressed
prior
decisions
and
some
peripheral
decisions,
early
ones
by
this
court
under
the
fela.
and
in
this
area
alone,
as
far
as
i
can
see,
a
narrow
standard
was
adapted
for
coverage
by
the
lower
courts
which
we
attack
is
inappropriate
now
before
this
court.
mr.
arne
werchick
not
refrigerated
car
companies,
no.
there've
been
no
mentions
of
refrigerator
car
companies
insofar
as
any
discussions
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
they're
concerned
in
congress.
mr.
arne
werchick
well
i
think
first
of
all,
mr.
justice
brennan,
you
could
just
take
the
phrase
itself
if
they're
a
common
carrier
and
they
act
by
means
of
rails
--
mr.
arne
werchick
that's
right.
but
as
--
i
think
that
perhaps
most
clearly
pointed
out,
i
believe
it
was
the
hammarstrom
decision,
which
is
cited
in
our
briefs
in
missouri
appellate
court
that
the
language
is
simply
stated.
the
words
by
railroad
referred
to
nothing
but
the
instrumentality,
the
type
of
industry
that
congress
was
talking
about.
there's
no
magic
to
the
phrase
by
railroad.
it
refers
in
fact
in
the
early
days
the
word
used
to
be
used
to
mean
nothing
but
a
highway,
a
particular
type
of
road,
only
this
was
a
steel
road
rather
than
a
concrete
one.
mr.
arne
werchick
right,
either
it
uses
nothing
but
--
mr.
arne
werchick
it
is
certainly
common
or
public
in
its
structure.
it
deals
with
all
railroads,
all
line
haul
railroads
indiscriminately.
mr.
arne
werchick
its
rates,
in
a
sense,
essentially
they
regulate
it.
they
must
file
--
mr.
arne
werchick
the
contracts
between
the
railroads
and
the
so-called
private
car
companies
must
be
filed
and
approved
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
do
not
become
effective
until
approved.
they
have
since
1940,
have
the
authority
to
command
these
companies
to
turn
over
their
books,
provide
information
and
cooperate
in
investigations
so
that
they
can
determine
what
the
rates
should
be.
now,
they
have
a
central
rulemaking
power
over
the
rates
and
practices
of
refrigerator
car
line.
mr.
arne
werchick
they
so
indicate
in
their
affidavit
which
is
filed
that
they
will
provide
these
cars
to
any
railroad.
mr.
arne
werchick
i
believe
this
may
be
more
by
custom
in
the
industry.
i
don't
know
whether
the
law
has
in
fact
had
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
one
car
company
must
provide
its
cars
to
all
other
railroads.
they
just
do
it
and
always
have
done
it.
mr.
arne
werchick
i
don't
believe
so.
well,
they
can't
deny
their
common
of
public
calling.
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
there're
such
things
as
their
advertising
where
they
talk
about
to
the
public
“just
call
us.
we'll
take
care
of
these
services
anywhere
on
the
west”.
they
list
in
telephone
directories
all
over
the
united
states
under
the
heading
“railroads”.
they
describe
themselves
--
mr.
arne
werchick
no.
i
--
mr.
arne
werchick
the
only
language
of
this
court
on
that
subject,
mr.
justice
brennan,
has
been
the
statement
that
they
need
not
hold
themselves
out
to
the
public
at
all
and
can
still
be
a
common
carrier.
that
if
they
perform
a
vital
transportation
service
in
railroad
transportation,
that
makes
them
a
common
carrier
by
railroad.
and
i
have
reference
to
the
terminal
company
and
the
stockyard
and
beltline
railroad
cases.
the
fact
that
they
acted
as
agent
for
a
common
carrier
line
haul
operation
and
took
some
of
the
burden
from
the
shoulders
of
that
railroad
and
in
the
sense
divided
up
the
labor,
made
them
part
of
a
system
of
common
carriage
by
railroad.
this
concept
goes
back
as
far
as
the
southern
pacific
terminal
case
of
--
i
think
1908
where
a
terminal
that
did
nothing
but
provide
normal
terminal
facilities
and
wharfage
was
held
to
be
under
the
interstate
commerce
commission
jurisdiction
because
the
court
at
that
early
stage
said,
“you
can't
allow
railroads
to
go
out
dividing
up
into
small
parts
(voice
overlap)
control”.
mr.
arne
werchick
pardon?
mr.
arne
werchick
three
years
ago?
mr.
arne
werchick
it
doesn't
come
immediately
in
my
mind,
your
honor.
here,
there's
no
question
to
the
vital
part
of
a
railroad
operation
that
has
been
turned
over
to
pacific
fruit
express.
the
railroads
are
required
by
law
to
provide
--
mr.
arne
werchick
--
its
refrigerated
service.
mr.
arne
werchick
precisely,
instead
of
buying
them
themselves
because
they
would
be
legally
obligated
to
do
and
servicing
and
operating
them
and
controlling
them
and
maintaining
them
and
repairing
them
and
building
them
themselves,
they've
setup
a
separate
company
to
do
this
under
a
separate
incorporation,
but
is
doing
nothing
but
the
business
of
the
railroad
is
legally
compelled
to
do.
mr.
arne
werchick
no.
mr.
arne
werchick
that
--
mr.
justice
white,
this
company
is
a
common
carrier.
mr.
arne
werchick
it
--
mr.
arne
werchick
the
degree
of
involvement
in
the
interstate
transportation
of
goods
is
essentially
what
it
is.
if
a
company
merely
builds
cars
and
sells
or
rents
them
on
a
term
basis
maintaining
no
control
and
not
operating
them
and
not
getting
into
the
carriage
business
itself,
it's
obviously
not
a
carrier
because
it's
not
creating
risks
and
hazards
in
the
railroad
industry
in
that
sense.
but
this
company
is
doing
a
part
of
the
active
transportation
work
from
the
carriage
of
goods.
mr.
arne
werchick
no
they're
not,
not
generally
unless
they
were
to
--
separate
terminal
operations.
mr.
arne
werchick
yes
your
honor
but
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief
--
mr.
arne
werchick
no,
as
i
put
it
on
my
brief,
they
stand
in
the
relation
of
--
to
the
carrier
as
basically
a
shipper.
they're
nothing
but
a
bulk
shipper
collecting
the
smaller
parcels
from
the
individual
shippers
and
putting
them
together
in
a
large
package
and
delivering
them
to
the
railroad.
if
you
took
them
away
from
the
railroad
industry,
the
industry
would
go
on
as
it
is,
except
the
shipper
would
have
the
problem
having
to
get
his
goods
down
to
the
station
himself,
the
same
with
the
express
company.
but
you
if
take
away
the
refrigerator
car
operation,
there's
just
not
going
to
be
any
shipment
of
fruits
or
vegetables
or
other
perishables
in
the
united
states.
mr.
arne
werchick
i
think
mr.
justice
fortas
that
it's
done
more
--
with
my
understanding
and
i'm
not
as
informed
in
that
area,
i'm
talking
at
the
top
of
my
head
but
i
think
it's
done
more
by
standard
lease
to
the
line
haul
carrier.
and
i
think
the
line
haul
carrier
is
offering
--
mr.
arne
werchick
that
it
might
overlapping
to
the
area
--
i
see
that
as
a
transportation
service
--
mr.
arne
werchick
alright
mr.
arne
werchick
yes.
i
don't
think
it
need
to
apply
any
further
than
this.
mr.
arne
werchick
i'd
start
to
point
out
that
under
california
public
utilities
code
211
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
the
word
common
carrier
under
california
law
specifically
includes
refrigerator
and
car
renting
corporations.
secondly,
the
question
of
federal
safety
appliance
act,
the
safety
appliance
act
is
directed
to
the
vehicles
themselves,
to
the
instrumentalities.
in
your
decision
of
the
united
states
versus
california,
this
court
said,
it
could
go
after
the
belt
line.
it
didn't
have
to
wait
until
it
got
on
to
a
full
line
haul
railroad
in
order
to
enforce
that
act
in
considering
that
decision
at
its
narrowest.
it
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
holder
of
the
vehicle
and
anytime
that
somebody
is
injured,
or
anytime
the
unsafe
practices
found
is
the
person
responsible.
this
is
perhaps
the
most
aptly
illustrated
in
the
florida
case
that
i
mentioned
earlier,
mccullough
versus
jacksonville
terminal
also
cited
in
the
briefs.
there,
the
terminal
company
did
nothing
with
the
car
except
clean
it.
they
moved
it
for
the
purpose
of
servicing
it.
it
was
defective
under
the
safety
appliance
act.
suit
was
brought
under
the
vehicle
of
the
fela.
and
recovery
was
allowed
even
though
there
was
no
transportation
involved
in
that
sense,
merely
the
cleaning
of
the
car
making
it
ready
for
transportation.
the
question
of
what
happens
if
the
railroad
divests
was
raised.
suppose
it
gives
away
what's
--
we
maintain
is
really
what
it's
doing
here.
and
this
is
answered
in
part
or
at
least
by
analogy
in
section
57
of
title
45
which
is
also
part
of
the
fela.
and
it
says
that
a
common
carrier
for
the
purpose
of
that
act
is
anybody,
a
receiver
or
a
lessee
or
anybody.
it
says
carrying
out
the
operations
of
a
common
carrier
by
railroad.
and
that
section
has
never
been
used
to
decide
a
coverage
case.
i
might
suggest
in
my
mind
that
it
might
be
perfectly
adequate
to
decide
coverage
cases
because
it
says
anybody
performing
the
function
of
a
common
carrier
by
railroad
and
it
doesn't
say
a
bit
of
the
function
of
a
whole
function.
mr.
arne
werchick
taking
the
two
cases
that
--
mr.
arne
werchick
they
don't
operate
by
railroad.
in
wells
fargo
which
is
the
leading
express
company
case
and
the
one
that's
responsible
for
so
many
of
these
coverage
questions
--
mr.
arne
werchick
in
the
railway
express
case,
it's
discussed
i
think
from
the
fifth
circuit,
i'm
not
sure
your
honor.
it
specifically
says
it
is
a
common
carrier
but
because
of
the
lack
of
railroad
equipment
it's
just
not
operating
by
railroad.
now
i
--
mr.
arne
werchick
the
pullman
company
is
an
anachronism
as
far
as
the
robinson
versus
baltimore
&
ohio
case.
but
robinson
merely
said,
he
couldn't
sue
b
&
o
because
he
was
employed
by
the
pullman
company.
he
was
not
an
employee
of
baltimore
&
ohio.and
the
fela
gives
a
remedy
only
to
an
employee
of
the
carrier.
that
was
an
agency
case
essentially
or
a
joint
servant
question.
now
granted
there
was
a
sort
of
an
assumption
that
stated
in
that
case
and
i
maintain
that
it's
not
a
valid
assumption
that
you
can
never
have
two
common
carriers
by
railroad
working
together.
mr.
arne
werchick
among
other
things,
they
carry
three
million
tons
of
ice
every
year.
mr.
arne
werchick
they
use
for
their
own
purposes.yes,
and
they
load
and
unload
it
at
their
yards
and
--
mr.
arne
werchick
that's
not
in
the
record,
enough
to
fill
up
one
and
a
half
square
miles
in
roseville
anyway.
mr.
arne
werchick
we
know
that
there's
an
--
there's
rail
running
back
and
forth
and
i
could
only
guess
--
mr.
arne
werchick
--
how
much
rail
there
is
at
roseville
alone.
mr.
arne
werchick
well
--
mr.
arne
werchick
yes,
your
honor.
on
the
same
sense
that
the
lone
star
steel
company
with
only
rail
inside
its
own
plant
or
a
terminal
company
that
only
has
a
railroad
station
where
it
washes
the
railroad
car
or
the
union
stockyard
company
which
does
nothing
but
unload
beef
is
a
common
carrier
by
rail.
mr.
arne
werchick
again
i
can
only
--
mr.
arne
werchick
i
--
not
as
i
read
the
mccullough
decision
in
that
particular
instance.
and
also
the
mccabe
versus
boston
terminal
where
they
had
no
tracks
of
their
own
--
i
mean
no
engines
of
their
own,
no
cars
of
their
own.
they
merely
gave
signals
to
the
engineer
to
move
the
car
one
way
or
another.
mr.
arne
werchick
i
think
they're
both
carriers
in
the
transportation
service
by
rail.
mr.
arne
werchick
robin
--
with
the
robinson
case?
mr.
arne
werchick
insofar
as
it
might
be
assumed
to
hold
that,
yes.
although
it
can
be
distinguished
as
an
agency
or
joint
employment
case,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
reached.
certainly
i
feel
that
that
is
definitely
carriage
and
transportation.
and
i
feel
that
mr.
willis
in
the
general
counsel
for
pullman
in
testifying
before
congress
in
1939
so
stated
but
then
made
an
artificial
distinction
that
they
weren't
a
common
carrier
even
though
the
icc
classifies
them
as
a
transportation
agency,
yes
sir.
mr.
arne
werchick
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
but
you
bring
them
within
the
federal
social
legislation
that
covers
this
railroad
industry
in
terms
of
pension
benefits
--
mr.
arne
werchick
--
and
injury
benefits
--
mr.
arne
werchick
--
but
yes.
mr.
arne
werchick
yes,
that's
the
alternative
to
workman's
compensation.
