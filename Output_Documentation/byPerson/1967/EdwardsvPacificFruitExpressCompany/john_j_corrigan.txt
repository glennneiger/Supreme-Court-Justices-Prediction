mr.
john
j.
corrigan
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
make
a
brief
comment
of
my
position
and
then
i
would
like
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
that
your
honors
have
asked.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes,
the
case
is
sinkler
versus
the
missouri
pacific.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no,
i
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
sinkler,
s-i-n-k-l-e-r
versus
the
missouri
pacific.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
our
position
is
this,
if
it
please
the
court.
the
pacific
fruit
express
is
not
a
railroad
in
the
sense
that
we
understand
it.
and
the
legislative
history
and
judicial
history
of
this
court
very
clearly
establishes
what
is
a
common
carrier
by
railroad
for
the
purposes
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
that's
the
first
point
i
wanted
to
make.
the
second
point
is,
there
is
no
need
and
no
reason
for
this
court
to
want
to
strain
or
to
extend
the
coverage
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
because
of
the
specific
directives
of
congress
and
because
in
my
view
and
as
i
put
forth
in
the
brief,
it
is
an
inferior
remedy
for
these
men
who
are
covered
by
california
workman's
compensation
and
i
will
address
myself
to
that
later.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
this
problem
[audio
abruptly
cut
27:17

trying
to
pull
themselves
up
by
their
own
bootstraps
by
saying
--
because
what
he's
doing
looks
like
railroading,
it
must
be
railroading.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
the
respondent
in
that
case,
justice
brennan,
had
a
non-delegable
duty.
when
you
are
an
employer
of
a
railroad
men
and
you're
a
rail
carrier,
you
have
a
duty
to
that
man
no
matter
who
hurts
him
if
he's
on
the
job
and
that's
what
happened
in
the
sinkler
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
in
our
case
here?
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no,
that's
not
what's
done.
i
will
expand
on
that
in
a
moment.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
if
it
is
a
railroad
that
does
their
own
icing
services,
that's
a
part
of
their
railroad
activity,
i'd
--
i
have
seen
no
reported
case.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
i
would
assume
that
they
come
under
the
act
because
they
are
employed
by
a
railroad.
and
the
key
test
here
and
the
reason
that
the
case
of
reed
versus
pennsylvania
railroad
that
we've
cited
is
so
important
is
this.
the
test
is
not
what
the
man
is
doing
at
a
particular
moment.
we're
not
going
back
to
the
moment
of
the
injury
test
that
this
court
was
faced
with
before
the
1939
amendment
to
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
what
we're
involved
here
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
reed
case,
you
recall
that
was
a
case
where
a
lady
was
high
up
in
a
building,
a
clerk
in
philadelphia
someplace,
and
there
was
a
cracked
window,
and
the
wind
came,
and
pane
broke,
and
it
cut
her
face.
this
court
said
that
you
don't
have
to
have
calluses
on
your
hand
or
soot
on
your
face
or
cinders
in
your
hair
to
become
under
this
act.
you
have
to
be
employed
by
a
common
carrier
by
railroad.
that
is
the
test.
now,
i'd
like
to
direct
myself
to
the
--
to
what
are
the
activities
of
the
pacific
fruit
express.
the
pacific
fruit
express
as
indicated
has
4,000
employees
who
have
been
under
the
benefits
of
workman's
compensation
for
many
years
in
california
and
other
states
in
the
west.
it
has
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
they
all
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
they
all
come
under
workman's
compensation.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes,
your
honor.
now
the
pacific
fruit
express
company
is
a
company
which
leases
or
grants,
as
you
will,
on
a
mileage
basis
refrigerator
cars.
and
it
supplies
what
are
known
as
protective
services
in
connection
with
that
leasing
or
renting
of
railroad
cars.
by
that
is
meant,
it
supplies
ice,
it
supplies
mechanical
equipment
in
the
cars
to
refrigerate
perishables
or
to
keep
the
temperature
up
in
case
of
cold
weather
to
preserve
the
perishables.
it
does
not
switch
cars
for
any
railroad.
it
does
not
switch
cars
for
the
public.
the
only
place
that
it
has
any
track
is
within
the
confines
of
its
own
plant
where
it
services
its
cars
--
plants
i
should've
said.
now
it
--
of
necessity
would
have
to
have
tracks
within
plant
because
it
services
its
own
railroad
cars
and
then
they
have
to
be
placed
on
rails
to
move
them
about
within
the
plant
area.
it
has
no
switch
engines
other
than
two
light
engines
used
within
its
shops
at
roseville
and
tucson,
arizona
to
move
the
cars
around
within
the
shop.
so
in
this
sense,
it
has
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
its
own
shop
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
these
locomotives
never
leave
the
shop.
and
this
is
why
this
is
important.
you
know,
there
have
been
other
cases
in
lower
courts
involving
the
ford
motor
company,
general
electric,
armco
steel
where
in
these
companies
had
intra-plant
railroads.
and
the
question
was
since
they
have
a
railroad
running
within
the
plant,
they
must
come
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
these
cases
are
set
forth
in
our
brief.
the
point
was
though,
and
the
decision
was
in
those
cases.
these
are
all
federal
district
cases.
i
believe
one
of
them
is
a
circuit
court
decision.
it
was
that
because
they're
running
a
railroad
doesn't
make
them
a
common
carrier
by
railroad
that
this
--
so
in
those
cases,
even
though
they
actually
had
an
operational
railroad,
it
never
left
the
premises
of
the
industry
involved
and
wasn't
treated
as
a
common
carrier.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no
sir,
they
were
not
within
the
act.
and
then
in
our
brief,
you
have
--
someone
asked
this
question,
before
i
want
to
direct
your
attention
to
the
case
of
wells
fargo
versus
taylor
and
baltimore
and
ohio,
robertson
versus
baltimore
&
ohio.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
now
this
court
held
in
robinson
versus
baltimore
&
ohio
that
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that's
in
the
brief,
your
honor.
and
it's
the
united
states
--
it's
this
court's
opinion,
it's
reported
in
237
u.s.
and
i
should
call
your
attention
also
to
wells
fargo
versus
taylor
in
245
u.s.
now
these
cases
held
this
that
a
pullman
porter
in
the
baltimore
&
ohio
case,
a
pullman
porter
working
on
an
interstate
train
moving
in
interstate
commerce
did
not
come
within
the
act,
because
the
pullman
company
was
not
an
interstate
carrier
by
railroad,
unanimous
opinion
of
this
court.
in
wells
fargo
versus
taylor,
unanimous
opinion
of
this
court,
it
was
held
that
an
express
company
employee
did
not
come
within
the
act.
so
far
as
the
question
of
freight
forwarders,
mr.
justice
white,
that
was
decided
in
the
case
of
lafsco.
i
don't
remember
the
name
of
the
defendant
therein
but
it
appears
in
our
brief
and
it
was
specifically
held
that
freight
forwarders
do
not
come
within
the
act
because
they
are
not
common
carriers
by
railroad.
now
what
i'd
like
to
do
at
this
point
is
to
go
through
very
briefly
the
legislative
and
judicial
history
so
that
you
can
see
that
this
act
was
intended
for
operational
railroads
in
the
sense
that
we
understand
it.
the
act
was
first
passed
in
1906
and
it
was
held
unconstitutional,
because
at
that
time,
the
first
act
and
i
believe
this
is
very
important
said
this,
“that
this
act
shall
apply
to
every
common
carrier
engaged
in
trade
or
commerce”.
in
1908,
this
court
held
that
that
first
employers'
liability
act
was
unconstitutional.
and
one
of
the
things
this
court
pointed
out
was
it
applies
to
too
many
companies.
it
applies
not
only
to
railroads
but
ferries,
bridges
and
things
of
that
sort.
and
that's
--
so
the
court
held
that
unconstitutional.congress
cited
the
court's
opinion
in
the
first
employers'
liability
act
case
in
their
reports
and
then
amended
the
statute
to
say
it
applies
only
to
common
carriers
by
railroad.
this
court
then
had
brought
before
it
the
second
employers'
liability
act
case
in
1912.
and
at
that
time,
this
court
said,
"yes,
it
only
means
common
carriers
by
railroad".
and
they
referred
to
the
first
act
which
was
held
unconstitutional
which
went
too
far.
now
after
that
second
employer's
liability
act
case
in
1912,
there
was
the
baltimore
&
ohio
case,
the
robinson
case,
wherein
this
court
said
it
doesn't
apply
to
porters.
there
was
the
wells
fargo
versus
taylor
where
it
said
it
doesn't
apply
to
express
company
employees
even
though
they
may
be
working
on
trains.
then
there
was
a
trilogy
of
cases
which
are
very
important
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
and
on
this
subject
mr.
justice
brennan,
this
company
is
not
controlled
or
answerable
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
except
that
it
has
under
a
1940
amendment
to
the
interstate
commerce
act,
it
has
to
supply
uniform
accounting
method.
that's
the
only
control
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
over
refrigerator
car
companies.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
the
safety
appliance
act
does
not
apply,
mr.
justice
brennan
to
this
kind
of
company
for
this
reason.
the
safety
appliances
acts
are
directed
to
common
carriers
by
railroad
who
in
their
service
carry
such
cars.
now
if
we
build
a
car,
we
have
to
make
sure
it
has
a
safety
appliance
because
the
railroad
won't
carry
it.
but
the
united
states
attorney
when
he
brings
an
action
for
a
violation
of
the
safety
appliance
act
does
not
and
cannot,
under
the
law,
bring
in
against
a
refrigerator
car
company
but
must
bring
it
against
the
carrier
who's
carrying
it
in
commerce.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
with
the
railroad
sir?
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
would
the
railroad
be
liable
to
my
company?
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
my
com
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no,
i
know
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no,
in
the
yard,
they
are
right
in
the
yard
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
--
where
they're
icing
the
car,
the
answer
is
yes.but
once
it
leaves
the
yard,
they
don't
ride
the
train
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
in
the
yard?
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
we
do
not
come
under
the
act.
the
act
is
very
specific
to
safety
appliance
act
it
applies
to
those
carriers
who
pull
those
trains
without
equipment
on
it.
that's
the
first
three
words
of
each
section
of
the
safety
appliance
act.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
pfe
employee
is
injured
in
the
yard?
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
the
comp
--
the
pacific
fruit
express,
justice
black,
would
be
responsible
to
its
own
employee
under
california
workman's
compensation.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
the
railroad
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
if
the
railroad
is
at
that
moment
hauling
or
has
taken
the
car
in
its
possession,
the
railroad
then
is
liable
to
its
own
employees
for
such
defects
and
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
the
non-delegable
duty
mr.
justice
black
runs
only
when
it's
your
own
employee.
you
do
not
have
a
non-delegable
duty
to
someone
else's
employee.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
but
i
have
to
say
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
--
if
you
followed
the
logical
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
--
extension
of
my
argument
that
if
a
railroad
leased
all
of
its
equipment
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
--
to
someone
else,
i
think
what
would
happen
at
that
point
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
the
railroad
couldn't
--
then
would
be
turning
over
its
operational
activities
that
the
totality
of
its
operation.
it
couldn't
avoid
responsibility
in
that
manner.
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
i
think
there
is
a
point
at
which
it
cannot
divest
itself
and
avoid
responsibility.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
i
don't
know
sir.
i
think
that
if
they
turned
over
their
entire
stock
to
someone
else
to
run
it,
they
couldn't
avoid
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
if
it
was
limited,
i
believe
it
could,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
well,
as
i
say
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
well,
i
believe
--
carrying
my
argument
towards
extension,
they
could
do
it
to
a
certain
degree.
but
i
feel
that
after
they
got
so
far
that
they
would
be
turning
their
operations
over
to
someone
else
and
that
would
be
seen
through.
i
would
like
to
point
out
your
honor
that
the
aguirre
case
in
the
district
court
of
appeals
in
california
discussed
this
question
of
when
the
pacific
fruit
express
was
founded.
it
was
founded
in
1907,
but
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
that's
made
very
clear
by
the
decision
in
the
aguirre.
they
weren't
trying
to
avoid
responsibility
when
they
set
up
this
company.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
now,
i
would
like
to
go
on
though,
because
i
was
telling
the
court
about
these
cases
that
occurred
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no,
what
i
think
i
said
your
honor
is
that
we
have
to
maintain
our
equipment
so
that
it
satisfies
the
requirements
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act,
because
a
railroad
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
i
said
we
weren't
liable
under
the
federal
safety
appliance
act,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no,
not
as
a
matter
of
law
we
are
not.
but
we
wouldn't
do
business
with
anyone
because
railroad
couldn't
take
our
car
if
it
didn't
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
act.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
this
is
very
important
to
my
case
and
that's
what
i
was
just
getting
into
now,
mr.
justice
fortas.
after
these
refrigerator
car
companies
cases
in
around
1920,
this
court
held
in
a
unanimous
opinion
that
in
three
refrigerator
car
cases
which
i
have
cited,
that
they
are
not
common
carriers
by
railroad.
congress
must
have
known
of
these
cases
because
they
had
great
impact.
the
interstate
commerce
act
was
amended
in
part
as
a
result
of
it.
now
with
the
knowledge
of
this
court's
unanimous
holding
in
three
refrigerator
car
cases
and
in
the
other
two
cases
i
mentioned,
in
the
decade
of
the
30s,
there
was
a
lot
of
railway
legislation.
i've
cited
in
page
15
of
my
brief
seven
laws
that
got
passed
or
amended
and
in
every
law
from
1934
to
1939,
they
specifically
included
refrigerator
car
companies.
and
the
most
notable
example
was
the
railway
labor
act.
the
railway
labor
act
in
1934
was
amended
to
include
refrigerator
car
companies
because
they
had
never
come
under
the
act
before
and
congress
wanted
them
under
the
act.
and
congress
was
aware
of
these
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
so
they
amended
the
railway
unemployment
insurance
act.
they
amended
the
railroad
retirement
act
three
times
to
bring
them
in
within
its
coverage.and
then
in
1939
they
had
hearings
set
out
on
page
14
of
my
brief
when
they
gave
specific
determination
whether
they
should
extend
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
to
include
lesser
companies
other
than
common
carriers
by
railroad.
there
was
specific
discussion
on
this
issue.
and
congress
specifically
decided
not
to
extend
it.
and
the
only
railway
act
that
i
know
that
doesn't
include
refrigerator
car
companies
is
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
i
think
this
is
very
significant.
and
i
think
it's
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no
sir,
but
your
honor
--
mr.
justice
brennan
i
believe
when
you
read
that
it
has
to
be
read
in
the
context
of
the
history
i
set
forth.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
they
knew
about
refrigerator
car
companies.
that's
why
in
1940,
the
year
after
they
amended
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
they
passed
an
act
amending
the
interstate
commerce
act.
i
believe
it's
section
114,
sub
(b)
when
they
said
that
refrigerator
car
companies
systems
of
account
and
accounting
methods
had
to
meet
this
commission's
approval.
but
beyond
that
we're
having
no
jurisdiction
over
you.
so
congress
knew
about
refrigerator
car
companies
and
they
brought
it
under
every
railway
law
there
was,
but
when
they
got
to
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
it
was
discussed.
the
railway
labor
was
there
and
they
said
no.
now
this
history
that
i'm
trying
to
relate
here
has
been
very
significant
in
the
past
decisions
of
the
third
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit
set
forth
there
and
the
california
court
and
in
the
utah
court.
this
influenced
them.
they
said
congress
did
not
intend
these
companies
to
come
under
the
act.
now
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
it
would
your
honor
under
this
court's
decision.
and
a
recent
decision
in
gollesby
versus
united
states
steel
in
379
u.s.
and
in
a
very
important
decision
in
244
u.s.
called
winfield
versus
new
york
central.
they're
cited
in
my
brief
the
winfield
case.
yes,
this
is
--
you
would
take
--
there
are
4,000
other
people
working
for
pacific
fruit
express.
you
would
automatically
divest
them
of
their
rights
under
california
workman's
compensation.
and
i
think
that
as
it's
pointed
in
some
of
these
prior
refrigerator
car
company
cases,
this
is
not
something
that
the
other
courts
have
been
willing
to
do
lightly,
because
it's
pointed
in
great
detail
i
believe
in
my
brief.
the
california
workman's
compensation
statute
is
simply
a
superior
remedy
for
a
working
man.
now,
we're
not
just
limited
--
ourselves
here
to
elijah
edwards
but
what
about
these
other
people?
for
example,
under
this
statute,
elijah
edwards
could
go
back
to
trial
if
i'm
wrong
and
he
comes
under
the
act
and
he
could
lose
this
case
because
we're
still
talking
about
negligence
in
this
statute.
and
i
think
this
was
indicated
that
negligence
and
proximate
cause
in
the
fela
variety
is
still
part
of
the
law,
this
court
so
held
in
bal
--
inman
versus
baltimore
&
ohio.
now
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
the
winfield
case
decided
that
the
remedy
for
an
employee
of
a
common
carrier
by
railroad
is
the
fela
and
it
is
exclusive.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes,
yes
your
honor.
the
--
this
--
you
see
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes.
yes,
your
honor,
you
see
these
employees,
i
can
only
speak
for
california
because
that's
where
i
practice.
they
all
have
a
remedy
against
in
third
party
tort
if
someone
else
is
responsible.
but
they
only
have
one
remedy
against
their
employer
and
that's
under
the
railroad
employee
comes
under
the
fela
if
anybody
else
would
come
to
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
what's
that
sir?
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
i
can
say
that
i
have
found
none.
now
i
may
have
been
derelict
to
my
research
but
i
have
found
none
sir.
there's
one
other
thing
i
want
to
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
because
in
sinkler
it
was
acknowledged
when
--
that
this
man
worked
for
the
missouri
pacific
railroad,
a
common
carrier
by
railroad.
the
case
started
out.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no,
he
sued
his
own
employer,
if
i
have
the
sinkler
case
in
mind.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
now
there's
one
other
thing
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
there
is
another
point
i
want
to
make
here
because
the
question
was
asked
by
the
court
and
is
one
of
the
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
right.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes,
but
you
don't
even
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
right.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
right.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
right.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
right.
you
don't
have
to
go
to
the
question
of
the
agency
because
there's
a
non-delegable
duty
and
if
i
may
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes,
but
that
reason
is
the
next
point
i
wanted
to
get
to
and
it's
this
your
honor.
some
mention
was
made
here
of
belt
liner
terminal
line
railroads.
they
are
not
like
the
pacific
fruit
express
and
they
distinguishable.
they
rely
on
the
parden
decision.
now
--
and
they
rely
on
the
brooklyn
terminal.
these
cases
are
cited
in
the
brief.
now
a
terminal
railroad
like
the
parden
or
like
brooklyn
in
those
two
cases,
they
run
a
little
railroad
at
the
end
of
the
line
where
they
make
up,
break
up
trains,
cross
city
streets.
they
have
a
marshalling
yard.
they
switch
for
the
public.
they
switch
for
other
carriers.
they
take
care
of
the
railroad
operations
in
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
right.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
correct.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that's
the
correct
analysis
of
parden,
but
they
choose
not
to
follow
that
analysis.that
was
what
parden
turned
on.
i
see
my
time
has
expired,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
i
just
wanted
to
say
this
then
if
i
can
finish
this
sentence.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
they
make
a
quotation
from
parden
and
they
say
this
in
their
brief.
it's
important
to
know
about
it.
they
say
--
parden
says
this,
“the
federal
employers'
liability
act
is
at
least
as
broad
as
the
safety
appliance
act
and
the
railway
labor
act.”
in
the
parden
case,
the
reason
this
court
made
that
decision
and
that
statement
a
couple
of
years
ago
is
because
out
in
california,
we
have
a
belt
owned
railroad
in
san
francisco.
and
it
comes
under
the
railway
labor
act
and
it
comes
under
the
safety
appliance
act.
and
in
parden,
you
said
that
they
come
under
the
fela
the
--
so
that
was
what
that
statement
was
about,
a
state
owned
railroad
as
such.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
make
a
brief
comment
of
my
position
and
then
i
would
like
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
that
your
honors
have
asked.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes,
the
case
is
sinkler
versus
the
missouri
pacific.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no,
i
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
sinkler,
s-i-n-k-l-e-r
versus
the
missouri
pacific.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
our
position
is
this,
if
it
please
the
court.
the
pacific
fruit
express
is
not
a
railroad
in
the
sense
that
we
understand
it.
and
the
legislative
history
and
judicial
history
of
this
court
very
clearly
establishes
what
is
a
common
carrier
by
railroad
for
the
purposes
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
that's
the
first
point
i
wanted
to
make.
the
second
point
is,
there
is
no
need
and
no
reason
for
this
court
to
want
to
strain
or
to
extend
the
coverage
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
because
of
the
specific
directives
of
congress
and
because
in
my
view
and
as
i
put
forth
in
the
brief,
it
is
an
inferior
remedy
for
these
men
who
are
covered
by
california
workman's
compensation
and
i
will
address
myself
to
that
later.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
this
problem
[audio
abruptly
cut
27:17
-
27:43]
trying
to
pull
themselves
up
by
their
own
bootstraps
by
saying
--
because
what
he's
doing
looks
like
railroading,
it
must
be
railroading.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
the
respondent
in
that
case,
justice
brennan,
had
a
non-delegable
duty.
when
you
are
an
employer
of
a
railroad
men
and
you're
a
rail
carrier,
you
have
a
duty
to
that
man
no
matter
who
hurts
him
if
he's
on
the
job
and
that's
what
happened
in
the
sinkler
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
in
our
case
here?
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no,
that's
not
what's
done.
i
will
expand
on
that
in
a
moment.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
if
it
is
a
railroad
that
does
their
own
icing
services,
that's
a
part
of
their
railroad
activity,
i'd
--
i
have
seen
no
reported
case.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
i
would
assume
that
they
come
under
the
act
because
they
are
employed
by
a
railroad.
and
the
key
test
here
and
the
reason
that
the
case
of
reed
versus
pennsylvania
railroad
that
we've
cited
is
so
important
is
this.
the
test
is
not
what
the
man
is
doing
at
a
particular
moment.
we're
not
going
back
to
the
moment
of
the
injury
test
that
this
court
was
faced
with
before
the
1939
amendment
to
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
what
we're
involved
here
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
reed
case,
you
recall
that
was
a
case
where
a
lady
was
high
up
in
a
building,
a
clerk
in
philadelphia
someplace,
and
there
was
a
cracked
window,
and
the
wind
came,
and
pane
broke,
and
it
cut
her
face.
this
court
said
that
you
don't
have
to
have
calluses
on
your
hand
or
soot
on
your
face
or
cinders
in
your
hair
to
become
under
this
act.
you
have
to
be
employed
by
a
common
carrier
by
railroad.
that
is
the
test.
now,
i'd
like
to
direct
myself
to
the
--
to
what
are
the
activities
of
the
pacific
fruit
express.
the
pacific
fruit
express
as
indicated
has
4,000
employees
who
have
been
under
the
benefits
of
workman's
compensation
for
many
years
in
california
and
other
states
in
the
west.
it
has
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
they
all
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
they
all
come
under
workman's
compensation.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes,
your
honor.
now
the
pacific
fruit
express
company
is
a
company
which
leases
or
grants,
as
you
will,
on
a
mileage
basis
refrigerator
cars.
and
it
supplies
what
are
known
as
protective
services
in
connection
with
that
leasing
or
renting
of
railroad
cars.
by
that
is
meant,
it
supplies
ice,
it
supplies
mechanical
equipment
in
the
cars
to
refrigerate
perishables
or
to
keep
the
temperature
up
in
case
of
cold
weather
to
preserve
the
perishables.
it
does
not
switch
cars
for
any
railroad.
it
does
not
switch
cars
for
the
public.
the
only
place
that
it
has
any
track
is
within
the
confines
of
its
own
plant
where
it
services
its
cars
--
plants
i
should've
said.
now
it
--
of
necessity
would
have
to
have
tracks
within
plant
because
it
services
its
own
railroad
cars
and
then
they
have
to
be
placed
on
rails
to
move
them
about
within
the
plant
area.
it
has
no
switch
engines
other
than
two
light
engines
used
within
its
shops
at
roseville
and
tucson,
arizona
to
move
the
cars
around
within
the
shop.
so
in
this
sense,
it
has
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
its
own
shop
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
these
locomotives
never
leave
the
shop.
and
this
is
why
this
is
important.
you
know,
there
have
been
other
cases
in
lower
courts
involving
the
ford
motor
company,
general
electric,
armco
steel
where
in
these
companies
had
intra-plant
railroads.
and
the
question
was
since
they
have
a
railroad
running
within
the
plant,
they
must
come
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
these
cases
are
set
forth
in
our
brief.
the
point
was
though,
and
the
decision
was
in
those
cases.
these
are
all
federal
district
cases.
i
believe
one
of
them
is
a
circuit
court
decision.
it
was
that
because
they're
running
a
railroad
doesn't
make
them
a
common
carrier
by
railroad
that
this
--
so
in
those
cases,
even
though
they
actually
had
an
operational
railroad,
it
never
left
the
premises
of
the
industry
involved
and
wasn't
treated
as
a
common
carrier.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no
sir,
they
were
not
within
the
act.
and
then
in
our
brief,
you
have
--
someone
asked
this
question,
before
i
want
to
direct
your
attention
to
the
case
of
wells
fargo
versus
taylor
and
baltimore
and
ohio,
robertson
versus
baltimore
&
ohio.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
now
this
court
held
in
robinson
versus
baltimore
&
ohio
that
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that's
in
the
brief,
your
honor.
and
it's
the
united
states
--
it's
this
court's
opinion,
it's
reported
in
237
u.s.
and
i
should
call
your
attention
also
to
wells
fargo
versus
taylor
in
245
u.s.
now
these
cases
held
this
that
a
pullman
porter
in
the
baltimore
&
ohio
case,
a
pullman
porter
working
on
an
interstate
train
moving
in
interstate
commerce
did
not
come
within
the
act,
because
the
pullman
company
was
not
an
interstate
carrier
by
railroad,
unanimous
opinion
of
this
court.
in
wells
fargo
versus
taylor,
unanimous
opinion
of
this
court,
it
was
held
that
an
express
company
employee
did
not
come
within
the
act.
so
far
as
the
question
of
freight
forwarders,
mr.
justice
white,
that
was
decided
in
the
case
of
lafsco.
i
don't
remember
the
name
of
the
defendant
therein
but
it
appears
in
our
brief
and
it
was
specifically
held
that
freight
forwarders
do
not
come
within
the
act
because
they
are
not
common
carriers
by
railroad.
now
what
i'd
like
to
do
at
this
point
is
to
go
through
very
briefly
the
legislative
and
judicial
history
so
that
you
can
see
that
this
act
was
intended
for
operational
railroads
in
the
sense
that
we
understand
it.
the
act
was
first
passed
in
1906
and
it
was
held
unconstitutional,
because
at
that
time,
the
first
act
and
i
believe
this
is
very
important
said
this,
“that
this
act
shall
apply
to
every
common
carrier
engaged
in
trade
or
commerce”.
in
1908,
this
court
held
that
that
first
employers'
liability
act
was
unconstitutional.
and
one
of
the
things
this
court
pointed
out
was
it
applies
to
too
many
companies.
it
applies
not
only
to
railroads
but
ferries,
bridges
and
things
of
that
sort.
and
that's
--
so
the
court
held
that
unconstitutional.congress
cited
the
court's
opinion
in
the
first
employers'
liability
act
case
in
their
reports
and
then
amended
the
statute
to
say
it
applies
only
to
common
carriers
by
railroad.
this
court
then
had
brought
before
it
the
second
employers'
liability
act
case
in
1912.
and
at
that
time,
this
court
said,
"yes,
it
only
means
common
carriers
by
railroad".
and
they
referred
to
the
first
act
which
was
held
unconstitutional
which
went
too
far.
now
after
that
second
employer's
liability
act
case
in
1912,
there
was
the
baltimore
&
ohio
case,
the
robinson
case,
wherein
this
court
said
it
doesn't
apply
to
porters.
there
was
the
wells
fargo
versus
taylor
where
it
said
it
doesn't
apply
to
express
company
employees
even
though
they
may
be
working
on
trains.
then
there
was
a
trilogy
of
cases
which
are
very
important
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
and
on
this
subject
mr.
justice
brennan,
this
company
is
not
controlled
or
answerable
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
except
that
it
has
under
a
1940
amendment
to
the
interstate
commerce
act,
it
has
to
supply
uniform
accounting
method.
that's
the
only
control
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
over
refrigerator
car
companies.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
the
safety
appliance
act
does
not
apply,
mr.
justice
brennan
to
this
kind
of
company
for
this
reason.
the
safety
appliances
acts
are
directed
to
common
carriers
by
railroad
who
in
their
service
carry
such
cars.
now
if
we
build
a
car,
we
have
to
make
sure
it
has
a
safety
appliance
because
the
railroad
won't
carry
it.
but
the
united
states
attorney
when
he
brings
an
action
for
a
violation
of
the
safety
appliance
act
does
not
and
cannot,
under
the
law,
bring
in
against
a
refrigerator
car
company
but
must
bring
it
against
the
carrier
who's
carrying
it
in
commerce.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
with
the
railroad
sir?
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
would
the
railroad
be
liable
to
my
company?
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
my
com
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no,
i
know
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no,
in
the
yard,
they
are
right
in
the
yard
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
--
where
they're
icing
the
car,
the
answer
is
yes.but
once
it
leaves
the
yard,
they
don't
ride
the
train
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
in
the
yard?
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
we
do
not
come
under
the
act.
the
act
is
very
specific
to
safety
appliance
act
it
applies
to
those
carriers
who
pull
those
trains
without
equipment
on
it.
that's
the
first
three
words
of
each
section
of
the
safety
appliance
act.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
pfe
employee
is
injured
in
the
yard?
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
the
comp
--
the
pacific
fruit
express,
justice
black,
would
be
responsible
to
its
own
employee
under
california
workman's
compensation.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
the
railroad
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
if
the
railroad
is
at
that
moment
hauling
or
has
taken
the
car
in
its
possession,
the
railroad
then
is
liable
to
its
own
employees
for
such
defects
and
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
the
non-delegable
duty
mr.
justice
black
runs
only
when
it's
your
own
employee.
you
do
not
have
a
non-delegable
duty
to
someone
else's
employee.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
but
i
have
to
say
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
--
if
you
followed
the
logical
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
--
extension
of
my
argument
that
if
a
railroad
leased
all
of
its
equipment
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
--
to
someone
else,
i
think
what
would
happen
at
that
point
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
the
railroad
couldn't
--
then
would
be
turning
over
its
operational
activities
that
the
totality
of
its
operation.
it
couldn't
avoid
responsibility
in
that
manner.
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
i
think
there
is
a
point
at
which
it
cannot
divest
itself
and
avoid
responsibility.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
i
don't
know
sir.
i
think
that
if
they
turned
over
their
entire
stock
to
someone
else
to
run
it,
they
couldn't
avoid
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
if
it
was
limited,
i
believe
it
could,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
well,
as
i
say
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
well,
i
believe
--
carrying
my
argument
towards
extension,
they
could
do
it
to
a
certain
degree.
but
i
feel
that
after
they
got
so
far
that
they
would
be
turning
their
operations
over
to
someone
else
and
that
would
be
seen
through.
i
would
like
to
point
out
your
honor
that
the
aguirre
case
in
the
district
court
of
appeals
in
california
discussed
this
question
of
when
the
pacific
fruit
express
was
founded.
it
was
founded
in
1907,
but
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
that's
made
very
clear
by
the
decision
in
the
aguirre.
they
weren't
trying
to
avoid
responsibility
when
they
set
up
this
company.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
now,
i
would
like
to
go
on
though,
because
i
was
telling
the
court
about
these
cases
that
occurred
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no,
what
i
think
i
said
your
honor
is
that
we
have
to
maintain
our
equipment
so
that
it
satisfies
the
requirements
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act,
because
a
railroad
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
i
said
we
weren't
liable
under
the
federal
safety
appliance
act,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no,
not
as
a
matter
of
law
we
are
not.
but
we
wouldn't
do
business
with
anyone
because
railroad
couldn't
take
our
car
if
it
didn't
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
act.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
this
is
very
important
to
my
case
and
that's
what
i
was
just
getting
into
now,
mr.
justice
fortas.
after
these
refrigerator
car
companies
cases
in
around
1920,
this
court
held
in
a
unanimous
opinion
that
in
three
refrigerator
car
cases
which
i
have
cited,
that
they
are
not
common
carriers
by
railroad.
congress
must
have
known
of
these
cases
because
they
had
great
impact.
the
interstate
commerce
act
was
amended
in
part
as
a
result
of
it.
now
with
the
knowledge
of
this
court's
unanimous
holding
in
three
refrigerator
car
cases
and
in
the
other
two
cases
i
mentioned,
in
the
decade
of
the
30s,
there
was
a
lot
of
railway
legislation.
i've
cited
in
page
15
of
my
brief
seven
laws
that
got
passed
or
amended
and
in
every
law
from
1934
to
1939,
they
specifically
included
refrigerator
car
companies.
and
the
most
notable
example
was
the
railway
labor
act.
the
railway
labor
act
in
1934
was
amended
to
include
refrigerator
car
companies
because
they
had
never
come
under
the
act
before
and
congress
wanted
them
under
the
act.
and
congress
was
aware
of
these
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
so
they
amended
the
railway
unemployment
insurance
act.
they
amended
the
railroad
retirement
act
three
times
to
bring
them
in
within
its
coverage.and
then
in
1939
they
had
hearings
set
out
on
page
14
of
my
brief
when
they
gave
specific
determination
whether
they
should
extend
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
to
include
lesser
companies
other
than
common
carriers
by
railroad.
there
was
specific
discussion
on
this
issue.
and
congress
specifically
decided
not
to
extend
it.
and
the
only
railway
act
that
i
know
that
doesn't
include
refrigerator
car
companies
is
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
i
think
this
is
very
significant.
and
i
think
it's
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no
sir,
but
your
honor
--
mr.
justice
brennan
i
believe
when
you
read
that
it
has
to
be
read
in
the
context
of
the
history
i
set
forth.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
they
knew
about
refrigerator
car
companies.
that's
why
in
1940,
the
year
after
they
amended
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
they
passed
an
act
amending
the
interstate
commerce
act.
i
believe
it's
section
114,
sub
(b)
when
they
said
that
refrigerator
car
companies
systems
of
account
and
accounting
methods
had
to
meet
this
commission's
approval.
but
beyond
that
we're
having
no
jurisdiction
over
you.
so
congress
knew
about
refrigerator
car
companies
and
they
brought
it
under
every
railway
law
there
was,
but
when
they
got
to
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
it
was
discussed.
the
railway
labor
was
there
and
they
said
no.
now
this
history
that
i'm
trying
to
relate
here
has
been
very
significant
in
the
past
decisions
of
the
third
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit
set
forth
there
and
the
california
court
and
in
the
utah
court.
this
influenced
them.
they
said
congress
did
not
intend
these
companies
to
come
under
the
act.
now
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
it
would
your
honor
under
this
court's
decision.
and
a
recent
decision
in
gollesby
versus
united
states
steel
in
379
u.s.
and
in
a
very
important
decision
in
244
u.s.
called
winfield
versus
new
york
central.
they're
cited
in
my
brief
the
winfield
case.
yes,
this
is
--
you
would
take
--
there
are
4,000
other
people
working
for
pacific
fruit
express.
you
would
automatically
divest
them
of
their
rights
under
california
workman's
compensation.
and
i
think
that
as
it's
pointed
in
some
of
these
prior
refrigerator
car
company
cases,
this
is
not
something
that
the
other
courts
have
been
willing
to
do
lightly,
because
it's
pointed
in
great
detail
i
believe
in
my
brief.
the
california
workman's
compensation
statute
is
simply
a
superior
remedy
for
a
working
man.
now,
we're
not
just
limited
--
ourselves
here
to
elijah
edwards
but
what
about
these
other
people?
for
example,
under
this
statute,
elijah
edwards
could
go
back
to
trial
if
i'm
wrong
and
he
comes
under
the
act
and
he
could
lose
this
case
because
we're
still
talking
about
negligence
in
this
statute.
and
i
think
this
was
indicated
that
negligence
and
proximate
cause
in
the
fela
variety
is
still
part
of
the
law,
this
court
so
held
in
bal
--
inman
versus
baltimore
&
ohio.
now
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
the
winfield
case
decided
that
the
remedy
for
an
employee
of
a
common
carrier
by
railroad
is
the
fela
and
it
is
exclusive.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes,
yes
your
honor.
the
--
this
--
you
see
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes.
yes,
your
honor,
you
see
these
employees,
i
can
only
speak
for
california
because
that's
where
i
practice.
they
all
have
a
remedy
against
in
third
party
tort
if
someone
else
is
responsible.
but
they
only
have
one
remedy
against
their
employer
and
that's
under
the
railroad
employee
comes
under
the
fela
if
anybody
else
would
come
to
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
what's
that
sir?
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
i
can
say
that
i
have
found
none.
now
i
may
have
been
derelict
to
my
research
but
i
have
found
none
sir.
there's
one
other
thing
i
want
to
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
because
in
sinkler
it
was
acknowledged
when
--
that
this
man
worked
for
the
missouri
pacific
railroad,
a
common
carrier
by
railroad.
the
case
started
out.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no,
he
sued
his
own
employer,
if
i
have
the
sinkler
case
in
mind.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
now
there's
one
other
thing
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
there
is
another
point
i
want
to
make
here
because
the
question
was
asked
by
the
court
and
is
one
of
the
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
right.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes,
but
you
don't
even
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
right.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
right.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
right.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
right.
you
don't
have
to
go
to
the
question
of
the
agency
because
there's
a
non-delegable
duty
and
if
i
may
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes,
but
that
reason
is
the
next
point
i
wanted
to
get
to
and
it's
this
your
honor.
some
mention
was
made
here
of
belt
liner
terminal
line
railroads.
they
are
not
like
the
pacific
fruit
express
and
they
distinguishable.
they
rely
on
the
parden
decision.
now
--
and
they
rely
on
the
brooklyn
terminal.
these
cases
are
cited
in
the
brief.
now
a
terminal
railroad
like
the
parden
or
like
brooklyn
in
those
two
cases,
they
run
a
little
railroad
at
the
end
of
the
line
where
they
make
up,
break
up
trains,
cross
city
streets.
they
have
a
marshalling
yard.
they
switch
for
the
public.
they
switch
for
other
carriers.
they
take
care
of
the
railroad
operations
in
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
right.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
correct.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that's
the
correct
analysis
of
parden,
but
they
choose
not
to
follow
that
analysis.that
was
what
parden
turned
on.
i
see
my
time
has
expired,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
i
just
wanted
to
say
this
then
if
i
can
finish
this
sentence.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
they
make
a
quotation
from
parden
and
they
say
this
in
their
brief.
it's
important
to
know
about
it.
they
say
--
parden
says
this,
“the
federal
employers'
liability
act
is
at
least
as
broad
as
the
safety
appliance
act
and
the
railway
labor
act.”
in
the
parden
case,
the
reason
this
court
made
that
decision
and
that
statement
a
couple
of
years
ago
is
because
out
in
california,
we
have
a
belt
owned
railroad
in
san
francisco.
and
it
comes
under
the
railway
labor
act
and
it
comes
under
the
safety
appliance
act.
and
in
parden,
you
said
that
they
come
under
the
fela
the
--
so
that
was
what
that
statement
was
about,
a
state
owned
railroad
as
such.
thank
you
very
much.
