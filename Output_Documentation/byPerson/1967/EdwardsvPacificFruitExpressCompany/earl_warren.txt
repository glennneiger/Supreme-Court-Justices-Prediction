elijah
edwards,
petitioner,
versus
pacific
fruit
express
company.
mr.
werchick.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
services
the
cars
themselves?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
makes
the
necessary
repairs
to
the
car?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
werchick,
i
understood
you
say
that
from
the
time
the
carriage
of
these
perishable
articles
started
until
the
time
they
were
delivered
whether
they
were
in
the
terminals
of
the
pacific
fruit
express
or
whether
they
were
in
route.
if
there
are
any
repairs
even
needed
to
the
cars,
any
mechanical
corrections
that
that
is
either
done
by
the
pacific
fruit
express
or
they
employ
the
railroad
that
they're
on
to
make
those
repairs,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
their
responsibility.
and
if
they
don't
do
it
themselves
they
have
to
pay
the
railroad
that
does
it
for
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
assume
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
corrigan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
any
states
that
where
--
they
do
not
come
under
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
workman's
compensation
laws?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
every
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
within
who's
shop?
chief
justice
earl
warren
its
own
shop.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
this
question,
mr.
corrigan?
if
your
--
if
we
follow
your
argument,
would
that
mean
that
the
railroad
company,
any
railroad
in
the
country
could
divest
itself
from
its
responsibility
its
--
to
the
employees
who
are
servicing
cars
and
so
forth
by
having
an
organization
such
as
this
for
all
of
its
rolling
stock
so
that
the
company
that's
in
a
comparable
position
to
the
pacific
fruit
express
would
have
all
of
the
cars
and
then
lease
them
to
the
--
as
they
do
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it's
a
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
put
it
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
may
not
--
if
it
doesn't
test
to
a
lesser
degree
that
it
can
do
that
and
relieve
itself
of
responsibilities
that
it
otherwise
would
have.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
this
is
a
pretty
big
operation
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
would
that
point
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
if
they
can
do
this
with
the
pacific
fruit
express
which
has
--
what
is
something
around
35
or
40%
of
all
of
this
kind
of
traffic
in
the
country,
if
it
could
do
it
for
this
one,
it
could
do
it
for
all
of
them
who
are
in
that
same
business
and
could
it
relieve
itself
in
that
whole
classification
with
business
by
--
in
a
arrangement
of
this
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
and
then
suppose
they
decided
they
do
it
with
the
oil
business,
could
they
do
it
that
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
if
they
did
--
could
do
that,
could
they
do
it
with
general
cargo
until
they
had
made
arrangement
of
this
kind
where
they
weren't
liable
for
anybody's
employees
unless
shared
some
of
the
responsibilities
of
the
federal
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know,
but
we
have
to
judge
it
by
what
possibilities
of
the
act
are
completely.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
decided
this
case
with
the
petitioner,
would
this
--
would
it
automatically
take
all
of
these
employees
and
all
the
states
of
the
union
out
of
the
workman's
compensation
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
exclusive,
is
that
just
against
the
employer
or?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
that
will
--
could
it
be
exclusive
so
far
as
the
employer
is
concerned
but
not
as
against
the
third
person?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
finish
the
sentence
that
you
are
on.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
werchick.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
werchick,
if
we
decide
with
you,
do
we
wipe
out
the
protection
of
all
these
4,000
employees
under
the
workman's
compensation
acts
of
all
the
states
of
the
union?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
just
asking
if
that
is
a--
chief
justice
earl

is
the
alternative.
