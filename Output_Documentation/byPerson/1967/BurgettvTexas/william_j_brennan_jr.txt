justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
did
he
finally
go
a
little
beyond
that
to
say
that
waiver
is
not
to
be
inferred
from
silence
of
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
affirmed
the
burdens
on
the
state
to
establish
a
waiver
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
tell
us
that
here,
the
state
gives
us
the
alleged
--
basis
of
waiver
and
affidavits
they
filed
after
the
case
came
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
without
giving
you
an
opportunity
to
see
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
extraordinary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
both
of
the
convictions
they
offered
were
stricken,
weren't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
know
about
why
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they
weren't
--
jury
was
told
not
to
consider
them
at
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
suppose
for
you
to
succeed,
you
do
have
to
say
that
this
evidence
was
--
which
was
--
which
the
jury
heard
with
which
was
taken
away
from
them
and
they
were
told
not
to
consider
it,
that
instruction
was
not
sufficient
to
overcome
the
damage
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
this
particular
kind
of
evidence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
that
it
doesn't
--
that
in
these
circumstances
it
could
not
and
therefore
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
could
win.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
what's
the
other
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course,
but
didn't
finally
(inaudible)
say
that
if
the
record
was
silent,
you
could
not
incur
a
waiver?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
collateral
attack
or
not,
didn't
this
--
not
what
the
principle
was
determining
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
did
this
record
show
that
he
had
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
--
i
just
wonder
how
these
affidavits
indicating
that
in
fact
he
did,
is
this
the
one
we're
talking
about,
these
affidavits
in
the
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they're
not
really
properly
before
us.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me
mr.
douglas,
may
--
i
just
like
to
get
your
texas
procedure
straight.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
understand
that
the
recidivist
cases
in
order
to
get
an
enhanced
penalty,
there
must
be
established
two
other
convictions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
life
sentence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
actually
happened
here
as
i
read
this
part
is
initially,
6711
of
tennessee
was
offered
and
the
judge
reserved.
then,
there
was
a
second
offered,
wasn't
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
dallas
county.
and
on
this,
there
was
a
hearing
and
at
the
conclusion
of
that
hearing,
the
judge
said
you
can't
use
the
dallas
county,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
left
the
record
at
that
point
with
just
the
6711,
which
subsequently,
as
i
read
the
record
in
the
second
version
was
finally
admitted
in
evidence,
actually
received
in
evidence,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
in
that
posture
of
the
case,
without
any
thinking
more
in
the
way
of
prior
convictions,
could
there
have
been
enhanced
penalty?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
prosecutor
offered
nothing
more
thereafter,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whatever
the
reason
may
be,
he
offered
nothing
else.
and
as
i
read
the
record,
in
his
instructions
to
the
jury,
the
judge
referred
to
the
fact
that
he
had
admitted
something
faring
bearing
on
the
prior
convictions
and
said,
“no,
i
withdraw
all
as
to
(inaudible)
--
i
withdraw
all
of
this
from
your
detention
case.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
what
actually
happened?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
it
was
actually
--
was
it
received?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
didn't
read
it
that
way,
because
i
don't
know
this
material.
the
fact
is
in
any
event,
after
the
texas
conviction
went
out,
whatever
the
reason
was,
it
had
to
go
out,
i
gather,
from
state
law.
that
left
the
record
with
only
this
one
--
second
version
of
6711
of
tennessee,
although
the
indictment
alleged
other
tennessee
convictions
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
to
which
the
prosecutor
offered
no
proof,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
had
read
when
he
read
in
the
presence
of
a
jury
at
the
opening
of
the
trial
those
provisions
of
the
indictment
which
alleged
this
other
tennessee
conviction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
isn't
what
your
brief
says.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
this
the
only
one
mr.
douglas.
i'm
looking
at
page

of
the
record.
you
are
further
instructed
with
the
state
during
the
trial
of
this

offered
evidence

might
be
considered
as
tending
to
show
the
commission
of
other
offenses
by
the
15th

of

1964.
that
all
said
evidence
is
withdrawn
from
you
and
you
will
not
consider
such
evidence
for
any
purpose
whatsoever
in
arriving
at
your
verdict.
you
should
not
mention
or
discuss
in
your
deliberation
such
evidence
for
that
portion
of
the
indictment
that
you're
attempting
to
charge
such
further

such

is
that
the

justice
william
j.

oh,
you
are

read

you
was
not
evidence
and
shall
not
be

that's
the
whole
of
it?
justice
william
j.

in

capital
cases?
justice
william

so
what
happened

can't
happen
again

mr.
gooch,
that's
a

point
really
from
the
one
that
you're
here
on
in
this
case,
which
is,
as
i
understood
you
in
light
of
the
sentence
here,
there
was
prejudice
and
what
happened
about
these
other
convictions,
which
entitles
your
man
to
a

of
his
--
of
this
conviction.

that's
the
(voice

in

sentence

this

the
punishment

it
not?

well,
that's

you're
