mr.
gooch.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
other
two
tennessee
convictions
that
were
alleged
in
the
indictment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
was
one
of
the
tennessee
indict
or
convictions
that
the
--
they're
concerning
which
there
was
no
proof
offered
at
all
by
the
state,
two
of
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
two
of
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
we'll
recess
now.
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
mr.
gooch,
have
you
finished
your
impersonation
of
the
district
attorney?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
then
if
you
haven't
left
out
a
very
important
thing
with
this
appeal.
so,
i
mean,
the
facts
that
the
alleged
four
indictments
or
four
convictions
against
this
man
in
the
indictment
and
read
those
all
four
of
them
to
the
jury
and
then
made
no
attempt
at
all
to
prove
to
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
douglas.
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
the
way
back,
he
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they're
just
not
properly
here,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
--
how
do
you
defend
it?
now,
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
to
say
that
they're
properly
here
or
they're
not
properly
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
that's
all
i
want.
i
don't
want
you
--
i
don't
want
to
have
you
leave
here
with
the
idea
that
we
don't
have
to
consider
them,
we
don't
want
to.
they're
properly
here
or
they're
not
properly
here
and
you
say
that
they're
not
properly
here
so
that
ought
to
close.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
was
it
--
it
couldn't
--
you
couldn't
put
the
tennessee
conviction
in?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
douglas,
may
i
ask
where
in
the
record
we
can
find
that
the
--
that
these
tennessee
convictions
could
not
be
introduced
by
the
prosecution.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
anything
in
the
record
that
shows
that
the
prosecutor
made
a
valid
attempt
to
introduce
the
tennessee
convictions.
what
would
prevent
it
from
doing
so
by
the
ruling
of
the
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
ruled
out
--
the
record
shows
nothing
of
that
and
it
develops
only
when
you
write
a
brief
in
this
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
now
let
me
ask
you
this.
you
have
said
that
it's
necessary
to
overrule
spencer
if
we're
going
to
reverse
this
case,
leaving
out
all
except
the
two
convictions
concerning
which
no
evidence
was
offered
at
all.
what
comfort
do
you
get
out
of
spencer
for
saying
that
a
prosecutor
can
go
before
a
grand
jury
and
have
four
convictions
charged
against
the
man
and
then
when
he
gets
to
trial
reads
it
--
reads
the
indictment
with
the
four
convictions
to
the
jury
and
then
makes
no
effort
at
all
to
approve
two
of
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
--
you
said
we
have
to
overrule
spencer
and
i
just
want
to
know
what
comfort
you'd
get
out
of
spencer
if
you
think
spencer
said
anything
of
that
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
offer
them
to
show
you
good
faith
in
having
charged
them
in
the
indictment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
wouldn't
expect
them
to
--
that
they
were
all
bad,
would
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
rather
that's
a
presumption
there,
i
think.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
did
the
--
the
judge
found,
did
he
not
that
the
texas
conviction
was
an
unconstitutional
conviction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well
now,
did
he
instruct
the
jury
to
that
effect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
there
a
great
difference
between
instructing
them
not
to
consider
that
charge
from
advising
him
that
the
conviction
was
void
and
should
not
be
considered
against
the
defendant
under
any
circumstances?
chief
justice
earl
warren
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
never
told
the
jury,
i
understand
that
it
was
void
in
his
instructions
to
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
let
it
--
that
would
assumed
that
the
--
that
conviction
stood
but
for
some
reason
rather
they
shouldn't
consider
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
the
way
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gooch.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
