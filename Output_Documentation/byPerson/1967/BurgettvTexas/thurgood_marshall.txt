mr.
douglas,
if
this
is
just
an
assault
with
murder,
why
did
you
put
those
two
affidavits
in
your
brief?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
did
it
look
the
same
way
when
you
got
it
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
originally?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
mean,
didn't
you
see
that
before
you
introduced
it
in
evidence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
are
you
defending
the
person
who
did
offer
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
he
see
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
brings
me
to
my
next
point.
do
you
take
the
position
that
an
alleged
certified
copy
of
a
conviction
in
another
state
which
is
obviously
invalid
came
to
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
this
one
i'm
talking
about,
it
is
obviously
invalid.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
say
you
can
use
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
any
way?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
mr.
douglas,
did
he
know
what
those
prior
convictions
were
when
the
indictment
was
read?had
he
seen
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
did
the
best
he
could.
he
filed
a
motion
to
quash
as
a
--
to
the
best
he
could
do.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there's
no
other
way
you
could
do
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
that
all
he
could
do
at
that
time
under
the
law
of
texas.
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
that
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
it
have
--
would've
had
breached
those
indictments?
i
mean
those
convictions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
my
whole
point
was
he
made
the
point
that
he
can
object
to
the
reading
of
the
indictment
and
i
was
merely
raising
a
question.
how
could
he
object
to
these
convictions
when
he
didn't
know
what
in
the
world
they
were?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
didn't
see
them,
did
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
you're
going
to
say
he
waived
something,
we
ought
to
be
able
to
know
whether
he
intelligently
waived
the
objections
of
the
reading
of
the
indictment
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
think
so?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
think
there
was
a
waiver?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
