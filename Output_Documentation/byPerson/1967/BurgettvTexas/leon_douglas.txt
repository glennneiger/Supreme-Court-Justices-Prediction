mr.
leon
douglas
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
was
assault
and
intent
to
murder
case.
the
man
was
in
jail.
he
made
a
telephone
call
to
tennessee.
on
the
way
back,
he
stabbed
the
jailer
and
--
mr.
leon
douglas
on
the
way
back
to
the
cell,
he
stabbed
the
jailer
and
that
is
what
he
was
convicted
for,
assault
with
intent
to
murder.
there
was
no
enhancement,
no
repetition
except
for
some
words
in
the
judgment,
just
a
straight
assault
with
intent
to
murder
conviction.
this
case
is
one
where
i
believe
that
spencer
case
would
have
to
be
overruled,
the
mickelson
case
would
have
to
be
overruled.
this
is
a
matter
of
evidence
that
was
submitted
to
the
jury
and
the
court
instructed
the
jury
not
to
consider
it.
mr.
leon
douglas
the
only
thing
in
their
mr.
justice
fortas
is
that
in
the
mickelson
case
the
--
it
says,
the
limitation
instructions
on
this
subject
are
no
different
in
this
type
of
case
than
other
cases.
and
this
also
applies
in
the
spencer
case
and
that
was
cited
in
mickelson
case,
saying,
limiting
that
evidence
would
apply
in
this
type
of
case.
mr.
leon
douglas
it
said,
spencer
case
to
use
that
language
and
cited
the
mickelson
case
in
the
opinion
about
--
mr.
leon
douglas
it
started
out
that
way
your
honor
and
ended
up
as
a
straight
trial
under
assault,
intent
to
murder.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
douglas
this
is
not
a
recidivist
case
before
you.
mr.
leon
douglas
that
would
be
one
of
the
main
gist
of
the
case,
i
believe
it.
mr.
leon
douglas
mr.
justice
fortas,
this
--
in
the
development
of
this
case,
if
you
would
permit
me,
say
that
the
dallas
conviction
for
burglary
was
offered.
and
this
dallas
conviction
was
admitted
into
evidence.
when
they
came
to
the
sentence,
he
received
incidentally
three
years.
when
he
came
to
the
sentence,
it
read
not
less
than
two,
no
more
than
three.
and
when
it
was
offered,
it
looked
like
there
might
be
33
in
there.
they
had
erased
one
of
the
three's
apparently.
mr.
leon
douglas
well,
in
the
--
mr.
leon
douglas
in
the
certified
record
before
this
court,
it
looks
like
that
the
three
is
probably
erased.
the
printer
left
it
off
and
put
two
to
three.
mr.
leon
douglas
your
honor,
i'd
the
appellate
lawyer
before
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
i
didn't
offer
that
but
they
saw
that
in
the
court.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes
your
honor.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
but
i
--
it
is
my
contention
that
it
made
no
difference.
if
it
said
33,
it
made
no
difference
because
--
mr.
leon
douglas
your
honor,
i
do
not
agree
that
it's
obviously
invalid.
mr.
leon
douglas
i
--
maybe
--
mr.
leon
douglas
i
don't
see
--
mr.
leon
douglas
if
one
is
obviously
invalid,
i'd
say
you
couldn't
use
it.
i
don't
say
it
is
obviously
invalid
of
the
fact
if
the
man
did
not
have
counsel,
does
not
take
into
consideration.
did
he
waive
counsel
or
did
he
want
to
represent
himself.
in
moore
versus
michigan,
it
states
that
you
cannot
force
counsel
upon
a
defendant.
cases
have
been
reversed
because
of
forcing
counsel
upon
a
defendant.
and
the
fact
that
--
mr.
leon
douglas
your
honor,
this
is
a
collateral
attack
maybe
once
removed.
mr.
leon
douglas
it
says
that
he
must
show
that
--
mr.
leon
douglas
the
record
shows
that
--
and
that
--
i
checked
the
tennessee
law
and
to
see
what
these
instruments
were.
it
showed
that
he
did
not
have
counsel.
i
will
agree
that
he
did
not
have
counsel.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
probably
stand
--
perhaps
to
be
reprimanded
on
those.
i
read
the
case
of
giles
versus
maryland
that
came
out
in
february
this
year
and
i
saw
that
the
court
considered
some
other
matters
that
weren't
in
the
record
and
i
got
interested
in
the
tennessee
law
and
checked
it
out
and
talked
to
the
clerk
and
the
judge
hence
these
affidavits.
now,
i
don't
think
that
they're
--
mr.
leon
douglas
necessary
to
the
opinion
your
honor.
i
don't
think
they're
--
necessary
to
the
opinion.
now
--
mr.
leon
douglas
i
--
if
that's
what
the
court
says
your
honor.
i
had
seen
in
--
mr.
leon
douglas
i
don't
--
your
honor,
i
don't
defend
it.
mr.
leon
douglas
well,
this
--
i
will
say
that
they're
not
proper
here.
your
honor,
i
had
seen
--
mr.
leon
douglas
--
matters
come
up
--
pardon
me?
mr.
leon
douglas
alright,
your
honor,
(inaudible).
when
this
dallas
county
conviction
was
ruled
out
incorrectly,
this
was
a
33.
the
court
could
affirmed
that
or
it
could
reform
that
judgment.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
could
reform
that
judgment
on
appeal
or
if
even
as
in
the
penitentiary
it
could
not
been
collaterally
attacked
and
so
if
it
had
33
years,
it
was
still
a
good
conviction.
it
wasn't
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor.
it
was
a
bad
ruling
on
the
part
of
the
trial
court
that
kept
the
dallas
county
conviction
out.
on
these
habitual
criminal
cases,
the
conviction
must
be
prior
in
time.
the
commission
and
the
conviction
must
be
prior.
and
one
conviction
had
prior
to
commission
of
the
next
act.
so
when
the
dallas
county
conviction
went
out
then
the
prosecutor
could
not
go
forward
with
the
tennessee
conviction
so
he
had
to
withdraw
the
tennessee
conviction.
so
what
the
prosecutor
could
have
shown
in
regard
to
the
tennessee
convictions
is
not
in
this
record.
so
then
when
the
dallas
county
conviction
went
out,
he
could
not
go
any
further
as
a
matter
of
law
with
the
tennessee
conviction.
so
that's
the
record
you
have
before
you
and
the
fact
that
it
went
to
the
jury
or
if
they
heard
about
it
and
the
court
instruct
it.
let's
look
at
this.
there
was
no
objection
for
the
fact
--
mr.
leon
douglas
they
couldn't
put
the
tennessee
convictions
in
because
for
a
circuit
conviction,
it
must
be
of
like
character
and
the
forgery
is
not
of
like
character
to
assault,
intent
to
murder
under
texas
law.
so
as
a
matter
of
law
then
that
went
out
of
the
case
and
they
had
to
go
back
to
the
assault
with
intent
to
murder.
mr.
leon
douglas
because
--
assuming
that
the
dallas
county
conviction
was
good
in
which
the
record
and
the
law
that
i've
cited
in
the
brief
i
think
would
show
was
good,
used
the
dallas
county
conviction
then
we
could
go
to
the
tennessee
conviction.
you
have
to
have
three
of
them
under
article
63
to
get
the
habitual.
now
to
bring
it
down
to
the
second
case,
there
--
for
the
second
offend
there
--
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
douglas
that's
right.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
douglas
your
honor,
i
cite
in
my
brief
the
fact
of
the
texas
law
under
62.
under
--
mr.
leon
douglas
no,
sir,
only
as
a
matter
of
law
when
the
dallas
county
conviction
was
ruled
out.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
douglas
well,
if
it
would
be
--
mr.
leon
douglas
in
reed
your
honor,
there
were
eight
prior
convictions
and
you
needed
three.
i
don't
get
any
comfort
out
of
it
except
that
it
could
have
been
a
habitual
crime
--
habitual
criminal
case
if
the
state
had
been
permitted
under
the
law
to
prove
those
cases
to
make
three
of
them.
if
we've
been
permitted,
we
could
have
made
--
i
say
that
we
could
have
made
a
life
sentence
case
if
he
hadn't
incorrectly
ruled
out
the
dallas
case
and
that's
no
--
that's
when
the
law
says,
you
can't
go
any
further.
when
we
knocked
out
the
dallas
case,
well
we
could
not
go
any
further
as
a
matter
of
law
and
that's
the
reason
it
was
not
--
they
couldn't
go
in
to
those.
mr.
leon
douglas
may
i
go
on
to
this
good
faith.
the
district
attorney
offered
to
stipulate
the
prior
convictions
and
the
--
they
--
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
they
wanted
to
see
these
prior
convictions
ahead
of
time.
mr.
leon
douglas
your
honor,
i
don't
know
if
they're
bad.
the
tennessee
--
mr.
leon
douglas
the
tennessee
law,
we
could
look
at
that
just
a
moment.
it
has
--
had
a
statute
since
1855
requiring
appointment
of
counsel
in
all
felony
cases.
and
even
in
misdemeanor
cases.
i
checked
the
cases
in
tennessee
and
i
found
three
that
mentioned
without
counsel.
one
of
them
was
reversed
or
about
three
of
them
reversed
because
it
didn't
give
them
enough
time
to
prepare
--
appointed
counsel
to
prepare
for
trial.
another
case
was
reversed
because
the
justice
of
the
peace
did
not
advice
the
defendant
of
all
his
rights
or
right
to
counsel.
no
cases
were
reversed.
i
looked
through
the
sixth
circuit
cases
from
back
past
the
gideon
versus
wainwright.
i
found
no
cases
that
had
been
reversed
in
the
sixth
circuit
or
denial
of
counsel
in
tennessee.
and
with
that,
i
think
that
looking
at
the
law
there,
no
case
has
been
reversed
in
tennessee.
i
couldn't
--
i
think
it's
a
presumption
that
he
perhaps
had
a
lawyer.
and
--
mr.
leon
douglas
well,
it
--
when
no
cases
had
--
there
was,
excuse
me.
there
was
one
case
reversed,
chandler
versus
fretag
was
reversed
in
this
court.
that
was
a
tennessee
conviction.
here,
the
man
was
charged
as
habitual.
they
asked
if
he
want
a
lawyer
and
he
did
not.
he
later
found
out
that
he
was
charged
an
habitual
criminal,
he
said,
i
want
a
lawyer.
they
denied
him
a
lawyer.
under
those
circumstances,
this
court
reversed.
and
that's
the
only
cases
--
i
wouldn't
say
that's
all
of
them,
but
that's
the
only
cases
that
i
know
of.
now,
under
--
we
started
out
of
course
as
a
--
as
an
habitual
and
under
these
cases
that
are
submitted
to
the
--
that
i
have
submitted
to
you
that
we
couldn't
go
forward
with
those.
now,
i
don't
think
there's
any
bad
faith
shown.
i
think
it's
a
bad
ruling
on
the
trial
court
and
this
defendant
made
no
objection
to
the
reading
of
that
indictment
because
of
these
prior
convictions
in
it,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
he
showed
to
ask
--
to
see
this
judgment.
and
if
you
permit
this
proceed
--
mr.
leon
douglas
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
he
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
he
asked
for
it.
i
don't
--
mr.
leon
douglas
your
honor
--
mr.
leon
douglas
you
honor,
that
motion
to
quash
only
contained
allegations
to
this
effect,
that
they
were
indefinite
that
the
indictments
were
indefinite.
mr.
leon
douglas
we
have
procedure.
we
have
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment.
you
have
a
hearing
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
jury,
and
you
can
develop
--
mr.
leon
douglas
--
develop
the
facts
or
motions
to
quash
--
mr.
leon
douglas
i
have
not
found
a
case
particularly
in
point
on
that,
but
the
statute
sets
out
a
motion
to
quash
in
exception
to
the
indictment,
a
motion
to
change
venue,
and
a
separate
hearing,
separate
statement
of
facts
on
appeal.
mr.
leon
douglas
they
were
alleged
the
dates
for
forgery,
the
dates
of
the
conviction,
the
place
of
the
conviction,
and
the
amount
and
the
time
they
were
alleged
in
the
indictment.
mr.
leon
douglas
i
have
in
--
he
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
showed
he
asked
for
it.
i
don't
know
whether
he
saw
them
or
not,
your
honor.
this
procedure,
somewhat
like
the
--
mr.
leon
douglas
well,
if
there's
no
objection
--
mr.
leon
douglas
if
there's
no
objection
in
the
record,
i
don't
know.
mr.
leon
douglas
not
until
this
case
--
the
spencer
case,
now
there
was
objection
in
the
spencer
case
to
the
reading
of
it.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
objection.
there
is
no
objection
to
this
indictment
mentioning
this
prior
--
mr.
leon
douglas
beg
--
yes.
mr.
leon
douglas
it
was
read,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
douglas
in
open
court,
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
your
honor.
and
this
was
just
a
--
this
is
a
matter
of
evidence.
i
think
this
case
comes
down
to
matter
of
evidence.
now,
on
the
procedure
in
texas
--
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
douglas
for
a
life
sentence
case?
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
douglas
the
dallas
county
conviction.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
douglas
no,
your
honor,
could
not.
mr.
leon
douglas
that's
right.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
douglas
the
dallas
county
conviction
was
actually
introduced
and
later
withdrawn,
the
way
i
remember
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
your
honor
--
mr.
leon
douglas
and
later
withdrawn
when
they
got
to
the
sentence,
that's
the
way
i
remember
the
record.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
douglas
that's
right.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
douglas
i
think
there
was
no
objection
to
the
first
of
the
dallas
conviction
and
then
somewhere
in
there,
it
was
later
--
at
the
time,
it
was
withdrawn
then
and
it
came
in
first
without
objection
and
went
further
to
the
sentence
and
then
it
was
withdrawn
then.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
your
honor.
the
way
i
remember
the
record,
i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
leon
douglas
i
might
have
shortened
it
a
little
bit
your
honor
in
a
thumbnail
of
summary.
now,
at
texas
--
mr.
leon
douglas
he
said
its
void,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
leon
douglas
the
trial
court
said
it
was
void
your
honor.
mr.
leon
douglas
no,
he
instructed
the
jury
not
to
consider.
mr.
leon
douglas
it
would
probably
be
different
but
most
of
our
judges
don't
give
reasons.
mr.
leon
douglas
most
of
our
judges
do
not
give
reasons
for
making
the
ruling
that
they
make,
they
don't
say
--
mr.
leon
douglas
no.
he
just
says,
not
consider
it
your
honor.
mr.
leon
douglas
he
said
evidence
to
the
effect
of
prior
convictions
in
the
reading
of
indictments
before
you.
you
will
not
consider
if
i
remember
it
correctly.
mr.
leon
douglas
that's
the
charge,
yes.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes
sir.
texas
has
the
procedure.
everything
that
the
appellant
or
the
petitioner's
complaining
about
has
a
procedure
now
as
--
and
even
in
capital
cases
where
you
have
a
separate
hearing
on
this
habitual
criminal
cases
where
you
read
the
--
you
do
not
read
the
prior
convictions
to
the
jury.
you
read
the
indictment
on
the
primary
offense.
you
have
penal
--
you
have
the
guilt
hearing
and
after
that's
over
then
you
submit
it
to
the
jury.
we
have
changed
that
effective
january
the
1st
of
1967.
mr.
leon
douglas
in
all
cases.
when
we're
up
on
spencer,
we
had
it
in
the
felony
cases
and
now
in
the
ordinary
felony.
now
we
have
it
all
cases,
capital,
felony
and
misdemeanors
where
jail
time
might
be
assessed.
mr.
leon
douglas
it
cannot
happen
again.
article
3707,
there
is
a
case
that's
not
cited
in
southwestern
(inaudible)
is
the
williams
case
and
our
court
has
indicated
or
shown
that
the
capital
cases
and
all
the
case
now
while
you
have
a
separate
hearing.
we
now
have
a
motion
to
suppress.
if
this
evidence
was
not
admissible
under
our
system
now,
we
have
this
motion
to
suppress
and
it
would
not
go
to
the
jury
since
it
would
not
be
read
under
3707
and
article
2801,
while
we
have
a
motion
to
suppress.
our
procedure
has
been
corrected
and
i
think
that
under
the
case
of
mcclellan
versus
u.s.
where
we
had
a
case
came
up
that
this
court
denied
a
read
in
and
where
they
had
courts
of
inquiry,
not
of
publicity
while
the
legislature
changed
that
and
this
court
says
that
we
will
not
reverse
this
because
texas
has
corrected
its
procedure.
and
with
that,
we
submit
to
you
that
this
case
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
leon
douglas
michelson,
m-i-c-h-e-l-s-o-n.
mr.
leon
douglas
your
honor,
it
is
cited
in
the
spencer
case
and
the
--
mr.
leon
douglas
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
was
assault
and
intent
to
murder
case.
the
man
was
in
jail.
he
made
a
telephone
call
to
tennessee.
on
the
way
back,
he
stabbed
the
jailer
and
--
mr.
leon
douglas
on
the
way
back
to
the
cell,
he
stabbed
the
jailer
and
that
is
what
he
was
convicted
for,
assault
with
intent
to
murder.
there
was
no
enhancement,
no
repetition
except
for
some
words
in
the
judgment,
just
a
straight
assault
with
intent
to
murder
conviction.
this
case
is
one
where
i
believe
that
spencer
case
would
have
to
be
overruled,
the
mickelson
case
would
have
to
be
overruled.
this
is
a
matter
of
evidence
that
was
submitted
to
the
jury
and
the
court
instructed
the
jury
not
to
consider
it.
mr.
leon
douglas
the
only
thing
in
their
mr.
justice
fortas
is
that
in
the
mickelson
case
the
--
it
says,
the
limitation
instructions
on
this
subject
are
no
different
in
this
type
of
case
than
other
cases.
and
this
also
applies
in
the
spencer
case
and
that
was
cited
in
mickelson
case,
saying,
limiting
that
evidence
would
apply
in
this
type
of
case.
mr.
leon
douglas
it
said,
spencer
case
to
use
that
language
and
cited
the
mickelson
case
in
the
opinion
about
--
mr.
leon
douglas
it
started
out
that
way
your
honor
and
ended
up
as
a
straight
trial
under
assault,
intent
to
murder.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
douglas
this
is
not
a
recidivist
case
before
you.
mr.
leon
douglas
that
would
be
one
of
the
main
gist
of
the
case,
i
believe
it.
mr.
leon
douglas
mr.
justice
fortas,
this
--
in
the
development
of
this
case,
if
you
would
permit
me,
say
that
the
dallas
conviction
for
burglary
was
offered.
and
this
dallas
conviction
was
admitted
into
evidence.
when
they
came
to
the
sentence,
he
received
incidentally
three
years.
when
he
came
to
the
sentence,
it
read
not
less
than
two,
no
more
than
three.
and
when
it
was
offered,
it
looked
like
there
might
be
33
in
there.
they
had
erased
one
of
the
three's
apparently.
mr.
leon
douglas
well,
in
the
--
mr.
leon
douglas
in
the
certified
record
before
this
court,
it
looks
like
that
the
three
is
probably
erased.
the
printer
left
it
off
and
put
two
to
three.
mr.
leon
douglas
your
honor,
i'd
the
appellate
lawyer
before
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
i
didn't
offer
that
but
they
saw
that
in
the
court.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes
your
honor.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
but
i
--
it
is
my
contention
that
it
made
no
difference.
if
it
said
33,
it
made
no
difference
because
--
mr.
leon
douglas
your
honor,
i
do
not
agree
that
it's
obviously
invalid.
mr.
leon
douglas
i
--
maybe
--
mr.
leon
douglas
i
don't
see
--
mr.
leon
douglas
if
one
is
obviously
invalid,
i'd
say
you
couldn't
use
it.
i
don't
say
it
is
obviously
invalid
of
the
fact
if
the
man
did
not
have
counsel,
does
not
take
into
consideration.
did
he
waive
counsel
or
did
he
want
to
represent
himself.
in
moore
versus
michigan,
it
states
that
you
cannot
force
counsel
upon
a
defendant.
cases
have
been
reversed
because
of
forcing
counsel
upon
a
defendant.
and
the
fact
that
--
mr.
leon
douglas
your
honor,
this
is
a
collateral
attack
maybe
once
removed.
mr.
leon
douglas
it
says
that
he
must
show
that
--
mr.
leon
douglas
the
record
shows
that
--
and
that
--
i
checked
the
tennessee
law
and
to
see
what
these
instruments
were.
it
showed
that
he
did
not
have
counsel.
i
will
agree
that
he
did
not
have
counsel.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
probably
stand
--
perhaps
to
be
reprimanded
on
those.
i
read
the
case
of
giles
versus
maryland
that
came
out
in
february
this
year
and
i
saw
that
the
court
considered
some
other
matters
that
weren't
in
the
record
and
i
got
interested
in
the
tennessee
law
and
checked
it
out
and
talked
to
the
clerk
and
the
judge
hence
these
affidavits.
now,
i
don't
think
that
they're
--
mr.
leon
douglas
necessary
to
the
opinion
your
honor.
i
don't
think
they're
--
necessary
to
the
opinion.
now
--
mr.
leon
douglas
i
--
if
that's
what
the
court
says
your
honor.
i
had
seen
in
--
mr.
leon
douglas
i
don't
--
your
honor,
i
don't
defend
it.
mr.
leon
douglas
well,
this
--
i
will
say
that
they're
not
proper
here.
your
honor,
i
had
seen
--
mr.
leon
douglas
--
matters
come
up
--
pardon
me?
mr.
leon
douglas
alright,
your
honor,
(inaudible).
when
this
dallas
county
conviction
was
ruled
out
incorrectly,
this
was
a
33.
the
court
could
affirmed
that
or
it
could
reform
that
judgment.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
could
reform
that
judgment
on
appeal
or
if
even
as
in
the
penitentiary
it
could
not
been
collaterally
attacked
and
so
if
it
had
33
years,
it
was
still
a
good
conviction.
it
wasn't
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor.
it
was
a
bad
ruling
on
the
part
of
the
trial
court
that
kept
the
dallas
county
conviction
out.
on
these
habitual
criminal
cases,
the
conviction
must
be
prior
in
time.
the
commission
and
the
conviction
must
be
prior.
and
one
conviction
had
prior
to
commission
of
the
next
act.
so
when
the
dallas
county
conviction
went
out
then
the
prosecutor
could
not
go
forward
with
the
tennessee
conviction
so
he
had
to
withdraw
the
tennessee
conviction.
so
what
the
prosecutor
could
have
shown
in
regard
to
the
tennessee
convictions
is
not
in
this
record.
so
then
when
the
dallas
county
conviction
went
out,
he
could
not
go
any
further
as
a
matter
of
law
with
the
tennessee
conviction.
so
that's
the
record
you
have
before
you
and
the
fact
that
it
went
to
the
jury
or
if
they
heard
about
it
and
the
court
instruct
it.
let's
look
at
this.
there
was
no
objection
for
the
fact
--
mr.
leon
douglas
they
couldn't
put
the
tennessee
convictions
in
because
for
a
circuit
conviction,
it
must
be
of
like
character
and
the
forgery
is
not
of
like
character
to
assault,
intent
to
murder
under
texas
law.
so
as
a
matter
of
law
then
that
went
out
of
the
case
and
they
had
to
go
back
to
the
assault
with
intent
to
murder.
mr.
leon
douglas
because
--
assuming
that
the
dallas
county
conviction
was
good
in
which
the
record
and
the
law
that
i've
cited
in
the
brief
i
think
would
show
was
good,
used
the
dallas
county
conviction
then
we
could
go
to
the
tennessee
conviction.
you
have
to
have
three
of
them
under
article
63
to
get
the
habitual.
now
to
bring
it
down
to
the
second
case,
there
--
for
the
second
offend
there
--
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
douglas
that's
right.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
douglas
your
honor,
i
cite
in
my
brief
the
fact
of
the
texas
law
under
62.
under
--
mr.
leon
douglas
no,
sir,
only
as
a
matter
of
law
when
the
dallas
county
conviction
was
ruled
out.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
douglas
well,
if
it
would
be
--
mr.
leon
douglas
in
reed
your
honor,
there
were
eight
prior
convictions
and
you
needed
three.
i
don't
get
any
comfort
out
of
it
except
that
it
could
have
been
a
habitual
crime
--
habitual
criminal
case
if
the
state
had
been
permitted
under
the
law
to
prove
those
cases
to
make
three
of
them.
if
we've
been
permitted,
we
could
have
made
--
i
say
that
we
could
have
made
a
life
sentence
case
if
he
hadn't
incorrectly
ruled
out
the
dallas
case
and
that's
no
--
that's
when
the
law
says,
you
can't
go
any
further.
when
we
knocked
out
the
dallas
case,
well
we
could
not
go
any
further
as
a
matter
of
law
and
that's
the
reason
it
was
not
--
they
couldn't
go
in
to
those.
mr.
leon
douglas
may
i
go
on
to
this
good
faith.
the
district
attorney
offered
to
stipulate
the
prior
convictions
and
the
--
they
--
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
they
wanted
to
see
these
prior
convictions
ahead
of
time.
mr.
leon
douglas
your
honor,
i
don't
know
if
they're
bad.
the
tennessee
--
mr.
leon
douglas
the
tennessee
law,
we
could
look
at
that
just
a
moment.
it
has
--
had
a
statute
since
1855
requiring
appointment
of
counsel
in
all
felony
cases.
and
even
in
misdemeanor
cases.
i
checked
the
cases
in
tennessee
and
i
found
three
that
mentioned
without
counsel.
one
of
them
was
reversed
or
about
three
of
them
reversed
because
it
didn't
give
them
enough
time
to
prepare
--
appointed
counsel
to
prepare
for
trial.
another
case
was
reversed
because
the
justice
of
the
peace
did
not
advice
the
defendant
of
all
his
rights
or
right
to
counsel.
no
cases
were
reversed.
i
looked
through
the
sixth
circuit
cases
from
back
past
the
gideon
versus
wainwright.
i
found
no
cases
that
had
been
reversed
in
the
sixth
circuit
or
denial
of
counsel
in
tennessee.
and
with
that,
i
think
that
looking
at
the
law
there,
no
case
has
been
reversed
in
tennessee.
i
couldn't
--
i
think
it's
a
presumption
that
he
perhaps
had
a
lawyer.
and
--
mr.
leon
douglas
well,
it
--
when
no
cases
had
--
there
was,
excuse
me.
there
was
one
case
reversed,
chandler
versus
fretag
was
reversed
in
this
court.
that
was
a
tennessee
conviction.
here,
the
man
was
charged
as
habitual.
they
asked
if
he
want
a
lawyer
and
he
did
not.
he
later
found
out
that
he
was
charged
an
habitual
criminal,
he
said,
i
want
a
lawyer.
they
denied
him
a
lawyer.
under
those
circumstances,
this
court
reversed.
and
that's
the
only
cases
--
i
wouldn't
say
that's
all
of
them,
but
that's
the
only
cases
that
i
know
of.
now,
under
--
we
started
out
of
course
as
a
--
as
an
habitual
and
under
these
cases
that
are
submitted
to
the
--
that
i
have
submitted
to
you
that
we
couldn't
go
forward
with
those.
now,
i
don't
think
there's
any
bad
faith
shown.
i
think
it's
a
bad
ruling
on
the
trial
court
and
this
defendant
made
no
objection
to
the
reading
of
that
indictment
because
of
these
prior
convictions
in
it,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
he
showed
to
ask
--
to
see
this
judgment.
and
if
you
permit
this
proceed
--
mr.
leon
douglas
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
he
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
he
asked
for
it.
i
don't
--
mr.
leon
douglas
your
honor
--
mr.
leon
douglas
you
honor,
that
motion
to
quash
only
contained
allegations
to
this
effect,
that
they
were
indefinite
that
the
indictments
were
indefinite.
mr.
leon
douglas
we
have
procedure.
we
have
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment.
you
have
a
hearing
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
jury,
and
you
can
develop
--
mr.
leon
douglas
--
develop
the
facts
or
motions
to
quash
--
mr.
leon
douglas
i
have
not
found
a
case
particularly
in
point
on
that,
but
the
statute
sets
out
a
motion
to
quash
in
exception
to
the
indictment,
a
motion
to
change
venue,
and
a
separate
hearing,
separate
statement
of
facts
on
appeal.
mr.
leon
douglas
they
were
alleged
the
dates
for
forgery,
the
dates
of
the
conviction,
the
place
of
the
conviction,
and
the
amount
and
the
time
they
were
alleged
in
the
indictment.
mr.
leon
douglas
i
have
in
--
he
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
showed
he
asked
for
it.
i
don't
know
whether
he
saw
them
or
not,
your
honor.
this
procedure,
somewhat
like
the
--
mr.
leon
douglas
well,
if
there's
no
objection
--
mr.
leon
douglas
if
there's
no
objection
in
the
record,
i
don't
know.
mr.
leon
douglas
not
until
this
case
--
the
spencer
case,
now
there
was
objection
in
the
spencer
case
to
the
reading
of
it.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
objection.
there
is
no
objection
to
this
indictment
mentioning
this
prior
--
mr.
leon
douglas
beg
--
yes.
mr.
leon
douglas
it
was
read,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
douglas
in
open
court,
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
your
honor.
and
this
was
just
a
--
this
is
a
matter
of
evidence.
i
think
this
case
comes
down
to
matter
of
evidence.
now,
on
the
procedure
in
texas
--
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
douglas
for
a
life
sentence
case?
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
douglas
the
dallas
county
conviction.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
douglas
no,
your
honor,
could
not.
mr.
leon
douglas
that's
right.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
douglas
the
dallas
county
conviction
was
actually
introduced
and
later
withdrawn,
the
way
i
remember
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
your
honor
--
mr.
leon
douglas
and
later
withdrawn
when
they
got
to
the
sentence,
that's
the
way
i
remember
the
record.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
douglas
that's
right.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
douglas
i
think
there
was
no
objection
to
the
first
of
the
dallas
conviction
and
then
somewhere
in
there,
it
was
later
--
at
the
time,
it
was
withdrawn
then
and
it
came
in
first
without
objection
and
went
further
to
the
sentence
and
then
it
was
withdrawn
then.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes,
your
honor.
the
way
i
remember
the
record,
i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
leon
douglas
i
might
have
shortened
it
a
little
bit
your
honor
in
a
thumbnail
of
summary.
now,
at
texas
--
mr.
leon
douglas
he
said
its
void,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
leon
douglas
the
trial
court
said
it
was
void
your
honor.
mr.
leon
douglas
no,
he
instructed
the
jury
not
to
consider.
mr.
leon
douglas
it
would
probably
be
different
but
most
of
our
judges
don't
give
reasons.
mr.
leon
douglas
most
of
our
judges
do
not
give
reasons
for
making
the
ruling
that
they
make,
they
don't
say
--
mr.
leon
douglas
no.
he
just
says,
not
consider
it
your
honor.
mr.
leon
douglas
he
said
evidence
to
the
effect
of
prior
convictions
in
the
reading
of
indictments
before
you.
you
will
not
consider
if
i
remember
it
correctly.
mr.
leon
douglas
that's
the
charge,
yes.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
douglas
yes
sir.
texas
has
the
procedure.
everything
that
the
appellant
or
the
petitioner's
complaining
about
has
a
procedure
now
as
--
and
even
in
capital
cases
where
you
have
a
separate
hearing
on
this
habitual
criminal
cases
where
you
read
the
--
you
do
not
read
the
prior
convictions
to
the
jury.
you
read
the
indictment
on
the
primary
offense.
you
have
penal
--
you
have
the
guilt
hearing
and
after
that's
over
then
you
submit
it
to
the
jury.
we
have
changed
that
effective
january
the
1st
of
1967.
mr.
leon
douglas
in
all
cases.
when
we're
up
on
spencer,
we
had
it
in
the
felony
cases
and
now
in
the
ordinary
felony.
now
we
have
it
all
cases,
capital,
felony
and
misdemeanors
where
jail
time
might
be
assessed.
mr.
leon
douglas
it
cannot
happen
again.
article
3707,
there
is
a
case
that's
not
cited
in
southwestern
(inaudible)
is
the
williams
case
and
our
court
has
indicated
or
shown
that
the
capital
cases
and
all
the
case
now
while
you
have
a
separate
hearing.
we
now
have
a
motion
to
suppress.
if
this
evidence
was
not
admissible
under
our
system
now,
we
have
this
motion
to
suppress
and
it
would
not
go
to
the
jury
since
it
would
not
be
read
under
3707
and
article
2801,
while
we
have
a
motion
to
suppress.
our
procedure
has
been
corrected
and
i
think
that
under
the
case
of
mcclellan
versus
u.s.
where
we
had
a
case
came
up
that
this
court
denied
a
read
in
and
where
they
had
courts
of
inquiry,
not
of
publicity
while
the
legislature
changed
that
and
this
court
says
that
we
will
not
reverse
this
because
texas
has
corrected
its
procedure.
and
with
that,
we
submit
to
you
that
this
case
should
be
affirmed.

leon
douglas
michelson,
m-i-c-h-e-l-s-o-n.
mr.
leon
douglas
your
honor,
it
is
cited
in
the
spencer
case
and
