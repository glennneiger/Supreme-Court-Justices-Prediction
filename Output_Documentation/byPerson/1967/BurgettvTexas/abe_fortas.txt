justice
abe
fortas
do
we
know
that
there
was
no
waiver
of
counsel
in
the
tennessee
case?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
(inaudible)
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
had
to
assume
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
you're
going
to
do
that.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
the
--
is
it
fair
to
say
that
where
that
the
rule
of
law
for
which
you
are
contending
maybe
that
where
the
prior
indictment
shows
on
its
face
that
there
was
no
counsel
then
it's
--
the
burden
is
on
the
state
to
prove
waiver
and
that
the
state
does
not
bear
that
burden
at
the
trial
at
which
they
want
to
use
the
convict
--
the
prior
conviction
then
the
conviction
was
brought.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
understand
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
gooch,
i
don't
understand
the
verdict
here.
this
petitioner
was
convicted
for
assault,
with
intent
to
murder
repetition
of
offense.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
correct
when
you
described
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know.
i
want
to
try
to
get
that
straight
on
page
6
of
your
brief.
the
summary
of
argument
you
said
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
an
assault
with
intent
to
murder,
repetition
of
offense
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
sentenced
to
ten
years
by
a
jury.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
did
the
jury
come
in
and
say
that
they
found
him
guilty
of
this
offense?
justice
abe
fortas
repetition
of
offense
is
a
means
the
recidivist
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
first
question
we
may
have
before
us
is
whether
they
consider
this
as
a
recidivist
case
or
as
a
case
of
conviction
under
the
assault
with
intent
to
murder
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
that
we
have
before
us
a
conviction,
a
sentence
under
the
recidivist
statute
or
not?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
we
do
have
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
before
us
a
sentence
under
the
recidivist
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
the
sentence
was
not
enhanced.
justice
abe
fortas
despite
--
justice
abe
fortas
--the
fact
that
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
to
disregard
for
any
purpose
as
i
remember,
any
evidence
that
was
submitted
with
respect
to
prior
conviction.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
does
--
what
do
those
cases
have
to
do
with
the
problem
as
it's
before
us
if
there's
no
recidivist
conviction
as
you
now
cite?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
about
spencer
though.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
you
see
this
case
as
it
is
here
before
us
as
a
case
involving
texas
procedures
under
the
recidivist
statute
or
not?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
the
prosecution
started
out
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
how
about
before
us?
what's
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
just
a
question
of
whether
the
evidence
introduced
purportedly
under
the
recidivist
statute
and
then
later
excluded
from
jury
consideration
by
instruction
of
the
judge
is
--
undermines
a
conviction
for
assault
with
intent
to
murder.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
why
didn't
you
put
it
in
your
indictment?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
have
cited
four
convictions
here.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
read
them
to
the
jury.
justice
abe
fortas
now
--
and
then
none
of
them
was
eventually
submitted
to
the
jury,
none
of
them
proved
out.
and
i
don't
care
whether
a
judge
could
rule
correctly
or
not.
they
were
not
approved
that
whether
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
nevertheless
the
--
when
they
hadn't
obtain
the
conviction
at
least
for
assault
with
murder
and
--
that
the
ambiguities
to
what
effect
a
defendant
of
recidivist
statute
had,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
do
we
know
that
there
was
no
waiver
of
counsel
in
the
tennessee
case?
