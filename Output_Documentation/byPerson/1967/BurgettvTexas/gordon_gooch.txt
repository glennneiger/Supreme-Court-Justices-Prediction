mr.
gordon
gooch
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner,
james
burgett
seeks
the
indication
of
his
right
to
counsel.
he
was
convicted
in
a
texas
state
court
on
a
jury
verdict
of
ten
years.
he
was
--
had
his
conviction
affirmed
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
texas
and
on
his
own
motion
obtained
a
writ
of
certiorari
in
your
court.
he
was
indicted
for
assault
with
intent
to
murder.
the
charges
against
him
were
brought
by
a
jailer
in
the
town
of
greenville,
texas
where
he
was
being
held
for
a
trial.
at
the
time
of
his
trial
as
his
trial
proceeded,
his
court
appointed
counsel
in
greenville
filed
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment
which
alleged
four
prior
convictions
which
the
state
used
to
invoke
one
of
the
habitual
criminal
statutes,
the
result
of
which
would
be
life
imprisonment.
there
was
no
state
procedure
available
before
trial
to
attack
the
prior
convictions.
the
motion
to
quash
as
set
out
in
the
statutes
applied
only
to
technical
features
of
the
indictment
such
as
an
illegally
constituted
grand
jury.
nevertheless,
the
court
appointed
lawyer
moved
to
quash,
stating
that
he
didn't
have
enough
information
to
make
any
further
attack.
there
was
no
action
taken
insofar
as
the
record
is
concerned
on
his
motion
to
quash
but
the
counsel
really
couldn't
expect
the
court
to
take
any
motion
since
the
texas
law
was
clear
that
the
defendant
was
not
entitled
to
have
copies
of
the
prior
convictions
that
were
going
to
be
used
against
him
and
that
the
defendant
was
not
entitled
to
object
prior
to
trial
to
the
use
of
any
prior
conviction,
instead
he
had
to
make
his
objection
in
front
of
the
jury.
as
the
trial
began,
the
state
read
the
indictment
and
the
jury
was
told
that
petitioner
was
duly
and
legally
convicted
on
four
prior
occasions.
as
the
evidence
came
in,
the
state
introduced
into
evidence
one
version,
first
of
one
of
the
tennessee
convictions
alleged.
that
conviction
stated
on
its
face
that
petitioner
did
not
have
counsel.
there
was
a
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
forgery
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
your
honor.
the
conviction
recited
on
his
face
that
he
had
appeared
in
court
without
counsel
and
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
counsel
had
been
tendered
to
him
or
that
he
had
waived
counsel.
his
court
appointed
lawyer
objected
on
the
ground
that
the
conviction
showed
on
its
face
that
petitioner
did
not
have
counsel
and
that
there
was
no
indication
of
waiver
which
brought
him
squarely
within
carnley
against
cochran.
secondly,
he
raised
the
issue
of
course
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
judge
reserved
ruling
and
the
state
offered
the
same
conviction
and
evidence,
this
time,
a
different
and
inconsistent
certified
copy
of
the
same
conviction.
the
second
version
did
not
have
a
recitation
that
counsel
was
not
present.
it
was
simply
silent
on
whether
counsel
was
present.
again,
there
was
no
language
in
the
second
certified
copy
of
the
same
conviction
to
indicate
that
petitioner
had
been
tendered
counsel
or
that
he
had
waived
counsel.
the
court
then
proceeded
to
receive
evidence
again
without
making
a
ruling
and
again
over
counsel's
objections,
proceeded
to
hear
evidence
concerning
a
texas
conviction
for
burglary,
the
preceding
in
1964.
the
judge
after
a
hearing,
partially
in
camara,
ruled
out
the
texas
conviction
on
the
ground
that
it
was
void
on
state
law
grounds.
he
did
not
admit
the
first
version
of
the
tennessee
conviction
that
recited
that
petitioner
was
of
--
without
counsel.
he
did
admit
into
evidence
the
second
inconsistent
version
of
the
tennessee
conviction
stating
--
overruling
defendant's
objections,
the
trial
proceeding.
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
record
to
indicate
what
happened
until
the
court's
charge
in
which
the
court
charged
the
jury
that
they
had
heard
certain
evidence
that
tended
to
show
that
the
defendant
had
been
guilty
of
previous
crimes
and
that
they
were
not
to
consider
that
for
any
purpose.
mr.
gordon
gooch
sir,
the
other
two
tennessee
convictions
were
never
directly
offered
into
evidence.
however,
the
tennessee
conviction
that
was
offered
and
admitted
into
evidence
contained
their
recital
concerning
one
of
the
other
tennessee
convictions
with
the
language
that
he'd
be
rendered
infamous
and
incapable
of
giving
testimony
(inaudible)
language
of
that
nature.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
a
blanket
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
your
honor
they
say
--
the
judge
instructed
them,
the
jury,
not
to
consider
the
evidence
that
they
had
heard
concerning
any
of
the
--
pending
to
show
prior
crimes,
i
believe
is
the
language
he
used.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
your
honor.
they
were
instructed
that
the
allegations
and
the
indictment
were
no
evidence
originally
and
also
specifically
in
this
connection.
mr.
gordon
gooch
two.
two,
two
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
--
that
were
admit
--
in
which
there
were
no
certified
copies
at
all
even
tendered
to
the
court.
mr.
gordon
gooch
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
like
to
place
myself
now
in
the
shoes
of
the
district
attorney
in
this
rural
county
of
texas
just
before
petitioner's
trial.
he
was
indicted
early
in
april
of
1965
on
this
habitual
criminal
charge
to
be
tried
later
that
month.
as
evidence,
i
as
the
district
attorney
have
four
alleged
prior
convictions.
now,
only
two
are
required
under
the
texas
act
but
i
decided
to
use
four
prior
convictions
which
i
am
permitted
to
do
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
i
look
at
this
convictions
and
i
see
that
at
least
one
tennessee
conviction
that
i'm
going
to
offer
in
evidence
is
inconsistent.
i
have
their
--
i
do
not
know
and
cannot
tell
which
is
the
true
certified
copy
of
the
tennessee
conviction.
but
this
i
can
see
that
on
the
certified
copy
of
the
conviction
that
i'm
going
to
offer
in
evidence
it
affirmatively
states
that
petitioner
was
without
counsel.
and
also,
there
is
nothing
in
any
of
the
convictions
or
any
of
the
papers
certified
under
civil
secretary
of
state
of
tennessee
or
of
the
clerk
to
indicate
that
petitioner
was
offered
counsel
or
that
he
waived
his
right
to
counsel.
as
the
case
goes
to
trial,
my
opponent
files
a
motion
asking
to
see
--
asking
for
more
information
about
this
convictions
that
i'm
going
to
offer
in
evidence.
i
do
not
have
to
give
it
to
him
and
i
don't
give
it
to
him.
instead,
i
make
him
make
an
objection
in
front
of
the
jury
after
i've
already
read
the
indictment
to
him
and
an
indictment
to
the
jury,
i
make
my
opponent
object
in
front
of
a
jury
and
assert
at
that
time
petitioner's
constitutional
rights.
the
first
opportunity
really
that
petitioner's
counsel
had.
the
trial
judge
admits
the
conviction
and
the
trial
proceeds.
the
jury
is
never
told
that
petitioner
was
never
validly
convicted.
they're
simply
instructed
at
that
late
date
not
at
the
time
the
evidence
was
offered
but
at
the
time
of
the
charge
not
to
consider.
i
don't
see
how
any
lawyer
reading
carnley
against
cochran
and
gideon
against
wainwright,
could
reach
the
conclusion
that
those
convictions
could
--
were
valid
and
could
be
used
in
evidence
against
petitioner
or
could
be
used
to
invoke
the
habitual
criminal
act
of
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
gordon
gooch
if
the
court
please,
i
cannot
honestly
say
that
for
this
reason
insofar
as
the
record
before
this
court
is
concerned
there
is
no
indication
that
petitioner
waived
counsel.
if
i
were
permitted
to
testify
based
on
what
petitioner
told
me,
i
would
say
that
he
was
not
tendered
counsel
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
--
and
he
did
not
waive
it.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
by
the
same
token,
the
state
of
texas
never
contended
in
the
trial
court
that
there
was
any
waiver.
they
never
contended
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
that
petitioner
waived
counsel.
in
response
to
petitioner's
petition,
they
conceded
that
their
proof
failed
because
respondent
did
not
have
counsel
in
tennessee
and
only
in
their
brief
that
they
include
as
exhibits
two
affidavits
filed
long
after
the
record
were
certified
in
this
court
purporting
to
be
affidavits
of
the
trial
judge
and
the
district
attorney,
reciting
the
conclusion
that
petitioner
waived
counsel.
i
was
given
no
notice
that
these
affidavits
were
going
to
be
taken.
i
was
given
no
opportunity
to
cross-examine
these
state's
witnesses.
petitioner
was
given
no
opportunity
to
confront
these
witnesses
against
him
and
petitioner
was
given
no
hearing
in
which
his
credibility
could
be
placed
in
context
with
these
affidavits.
mr.
gordon
gooch
sir,
i
believe
the
court's
already
said
that
in
carnley
against
cochran
expressly
that
unless
there
is
an
allegation
or
evidence
of
waiver
or
unless
the
judgment
itself
shows
waiver,
the
conviction
is
void.
and
petitioner's
counsel
did
all
that
he
had
to
do
under
carnley
against
cochran
to
throw
the
burden
back
on
the
state
by
pointing
out
that
the
--
there
is
an
affirmative
showing
of
no
counsel
and
no
showing
of
waiver.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
gooch
now,
with
this
evidence
before
the
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
your
honor.
that's
very
true
and
i
was
remising
that
--
calling
it
to
your
attention.
under
the
state
law,
he
may
allege
as
many
as
he
wishes
and
may
use
them
as
he
sees
them.
mr.
gordon
gooch
and
the
standard
on
appeal
on
those
cases
provides
no
relief
that
the
penalty
is
not
enhanced
which
is
exactly
the
position
taken
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
on
appeal.
they
would
not
let
mr.
burgett
even
have
his
case
considered
because,
under
their
own
decisions,
unless
the
penalty
has
actually
been
enhanced,
the
petitioner
has
no
standing
to
complain
about
the
use
of
the
prior
convictions
and
evidence
against
him.
in
particular,
the
case
that
they
relied
on,
their
most
recent
case,
the
defendant
was
given
99
years
instead
of
life
imprisonment
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
held
that
he
had
no
standing
to
complain
because
he
only
got
99
years
instead
of
life
under
the
enhanced
statute.
so
based
on
appeal
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
with
no
prospect
of
securing
consideration
of
his
claim
that
his
trial
jury
was
prejudiced
by
this
evidence
being
alleged
in
the
indictment
read
to
him,
offered
into
evidence
and
then
only
slightly
cured
if
it
all
by
the
instruction
of
the
court.
if
the
court
please,
this
is
strictly
in
violation
of
your
rule
in
chapman
against
california
which
requires
when
there's
unconstitutionally
obtained
or
used
evidence
comes
into
the
trial
if
the
state
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
it
did
not
contribute
to
the
result
in
this
case.
so
the
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
your
honor,
you
--
we
really
do
not
know
what
happened.
we
don't
know
really
why?
mr.
gordon
gooch
it
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
gooch
sir,
i
don't
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
i
don't
believe
that
mr.
burgett's
case
necessarily
stands
or
falls
on
that
point
but
it
is
an
important
consideration.
and
under
standard
set
by
this
court
in
the
last
century,
it
is
clear
that
when
evidence,
highly
prejudicial
evidence,
the
court
is
--
can
consider
and
should
consider
whether
or
not
the
jury
could
possibly
obey
the
court's
instructions.
and
in
this
connection,
i'd
like
to
point
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
that
--
yes,
sir,
that
is
one
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
--
reason
why
i
should
win.
mr.
gordon
gooch
the
first
reason
is
that
the
--
he
should've
had
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
to
have
this
evidence
stricken
before
the
jury
ever
heard
it.
secondly,
and
after
the
jury
heard
it,
there
is
no
way
that
the
instruction
by
the
court
would
be
effective
to
erase
this
from
their
minds.
mr.
gordon
gooch
absolutely
sir.
i
believe
that
spencer
simply
permits
a
one
stage
recidivist
proceeding
when
there
is
no
question
that
the
convictions
to
be
used
against
the
man
are
valid.
and
all
spencer
did,
if
the
court
please,
is
to
permit
texas
to
use
a
one
stage
recidivist
proceedings
and
to
use
in
evidence
before
the
guilt
has
determined
a
valid
prior
conviction
or
valid
prior
convictions.
spencer's
case
is
not
petitioner's
case
because
the
state
had
no
valid
prior
convictions.
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
if
the
court
please,
he
is
spending
ten
years
of
his
life
that
he
might
not
have
to
if
the
people
who
sentenced
him,
who
sentenced
him
under
no
standards
given
by
the
court
just
a
range
of
punishment
were
not
prejudiced
by
the
fact
that
they
had
information
that
they
couldn't
possibly
put
out
of
their
mind
as
to
four
prior
convictions
duly
and
legally
convicted.
and
as
the
second
circuit
held
under
rotier
against
labely
(ph),
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
recidivism
free
from
the
taint
of
this
void
prior
convictions
that
the
state,
really,
i
don't
believe
can
sustain
their
burden
of
showing
that
it
had
no
effect
at
all
on
the
jury's
ten
year
sentence.
in
texas,
cold
blooded
murder
premeditated
can
receive
two
years
probated
sentence.
mr.
gordon
gooch
i
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
he
was
advised
that
the
first
opportunity
petitioner's
counsel
had
when
he
was
offered
into
evidence.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
no,
sir.
the
objection
was
to
exclude
it
and
the
objection
was
overruled.
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
it
may
well
be
your
honor.
i
don't
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
your
honor
and
the
charge
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
for
any
purpose,
yes,
sir.
but
they
were
told
that
the
prior
--
that
evidence
of
prior
crimes
should
not
be
considered
and
the
convictions
and
not
the
indictment,
they
weren't
ever
told
that
the
man
never
had
been
convicted
insofar
as
the
state
was
really
concerned.
they
were
simply
instructed
to
disregard
it.
now
the
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
if
the
court
please,
i
--
if
so,
i
have
overlooked
it
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
all
of
the
circuits
have
considered
this
question
have
had
no
difficulty
in
stating
that
the
defendant
does
have
a
right
to
make
a
collateral
attack.
the
only
alternative
is
to
insulate
the
judgment
from
attack
and
let
him
suffer
the
harm.
let
him
go
back
to
the
other
state
and
attack
it
which
he
probably
can't
do
and
in
texas
is
not
permitted
to
do.
and
in
fact,
in
texas,
he's
not
even
permitted
to
tell
the
jury
that
he
is
attacking
in
a
sister
state,
his
prior
conviction
on
the
ground
that
they
--
it
was
obtained
unconstitutionally.
the
only
alternative
is
to
say
that
once
you
have
an
out
of
state
conviction
that
the
man
cannot
challenge
it
at
all
and
he
has
to
suffer
whatever
penalty
is
--
because
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
a
position
that
the
court
want
to
take.
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
in
all
of
the
circuit
courts
that
have
held
on
this,
that
has
presented
no
problem.
and
in
--
specifically,
united
states
against
jackson
considered
the
difficulties
that
the
state
may
have
in
making
this
kind
of
proof
but
the
alternatives
are
simply
to
deny
the
man
any
opportunity
to
make
a
challenge.
mr.
gordon
gooch
no,
sir.
i'm
not
aware
of
the
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
you
said
tuning
your
honor?
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
the
tuning
if
i
read
it
correctly
your
honor,
it
depends
on
the
restraints
that
are
being
placed
on
the
man
presently.
it
may
well
be
that
tennessee
would
have
to
give
him
a
hearing.
but
more
importantly,
texas
should
give
him
the
hearing.
texas
is
much
of
a
position
to
determine
this
as
anyone
else.
if
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
it's
i
think
an
entirely
different
case
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
but
it's
a
more
aggravated
case
when
the
judge
actually
had
missed
the
evidence
and
waits
till
the
end
of
the
trial
to
exclude
it.
it
has
a
more
damaging
effect
on
the
jury.
mr.
gordon
gooch
if
the
court
please,
i
ask
no
more
than
you
permitted
in
jackson
against
denno.
mr.
gordon
gooch
that
is
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
that
is
one
alternative
as
--
actually,
this
is
evidence
that's
coming
in,
unconstitutionally
obtained
evidence
and
i
don't
see
any
distinction
why
this
evidence
shouldn't
be
challenged
in
camara
as
much
as
other
evidence
is
challenged
in
camara.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
gordon
gooch
no
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
only
in
terms
of
aggravation
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
gordon
gooch
as
long
as
it's
unconstitutionally
obtained
evidence.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
gooch
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
so.
he
was
indicted
for
that
and
they're
recited
in
the
judgment
that
he
was
convicted
repetition
of
offense
but
from
the
sentence
that
he
received,
he
did
not
receive
enhanced
punishment.
so
i
really
believe
that's
a
clerical
error
although
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
he
was
convicted
as
a
criminal
repeater.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
no,
i
perhaps
tried
to
compress
too
much
in
one
sentence.
the
jury
would
never
--
was
not
charged
on
the
habitual
criminal.
well,
you
say,
were
only
charged
on
assault
with
intent
to
murder
in
a
lesser
included
offenses.
they
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
in
ten
years.
the
judge,
when
he
entered
the
formal
conviction
against
the
road
on
the
face
of
the
conviction,
convicted
assault
with
intent
to
murder
repetition
of
offense.
so
insofar
as
the
formal
judgment
of
conviction
is
before
you,
it
reads
assault
with
intent
to
murder,
repetition
of
offense.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
it
does.
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
there's
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
there's
no
question
that
that
is
true
insofar
as
the
record
is
concerned.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
that's
what
the
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
not
a
sentence,
a
conviction.
sentence
was
not
enhanced.
mr.
gordon
gooch
no,
sir.
but
the
conviction
before
you
is
a
conviction
for
assault
with
intent
to
murder,
repetition
of
offense.
mr.
gordon
gooch
he
was
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
and
that
--
the
jury
does
--
was
not
asked
a
question
concerning
whether
or
not
this
man
was
convicted
of
other
crimes
which
would
have
been
the
procedure
otherwise.
now,
i
wish
--
i
would
like
to
save
a
little
time
in
rebuttal.
i
do
wish
to
make
one
other
statement
and
that
is
that
petitioner
was
not
given
the
opportunity
to
be
present
when
the
prosecution
conducted
the
voir
dire
examination
of
the
jury
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
with
--
it's
very
clear
or
how
critical
--
critically
important
it
is
for
the
man
to
be
sitting
there
so
he
can
observe
the
jury
when
the
prosecutor
is
asking
the
questions,
so
that
he
can
form
a
basis
of
who's
going
to
be
leading
which
way
so
he
and
his
lawyer
can
have
an
adequate
opportunity
to
strike
the
people
that
they
think
are
against
them
from
the
start.
so
that
the
petitioner
can
be
assured
when
the
jury
gets
in
the
box
that
he
hadn't
even
started
with
the
prosecution
and
that
he
knows
as
the
best
that
you
can
know
that
he
is
going
to
get
a
fair
shake
of
the
jury.
mr.
gordon
gooch
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
to
make
several
points
in
a
short
time.
first,
i'd
like
to
say
is
that
mr.
douglas
i
believe
gave
you
the
order
backwards.
the
tennessee
convictions
were
offered
first
and
the
judge
did
not
preclude
any
evidence
coming
in
on
the
tennessee
convictions
that
were
offered.
the
judge
specifically
said
that
he
would
reserve
his
rulings
until
the
district
attorney
offered
all
evidence
that
he
was
going
to
offer.
and
when
the
district
attorney
--
this
is
on
page
36
to
41
in
the
record.
secondly,
obviously
then
the
state
was
not
prevented
from
making
any
proof
they
cared
to
make
in
connection
with
the
tennessee
conviction
that
was
admitted
in
the
evidence.
third,
i
don't
see
how
they
conceivably
could
make
this
a
life
sentence
case
not
only
with
these
convictions
but
also
in
the
brief
they
argued
because
the
jury
knew
that
the
defendant
was
in
jail,
that
the
jury
could
take
that
evidence
into
consideration
and
impose
a
life
sentence.
the
plain
truth
is
he
wasn't
even
convicted
at
the
time
that
he
was
held
in
jail.
next,
the
offer
to
stipulate
the
choice
that
the
defendant
has
to
make
is
--
make
these
constitutional
objections
in
front
of
the
jury
suffer
the
prejudice
are
stipulated
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
when
the
state
has
the
right
to
require
the
defendant
to
put
on
any
evidence
that
he
has
about
punishment
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury.
but
the
defendant
doesn't
have
that
right,
only
the
state.
we
only
ask
that
the
odds
be
evened
a
little
bit.
secondly,
the
motion
to
quash
the
indictment
does
not
go
to
striking
prior
convictions.
it's
simply
to
the
form
and
substance,
the
content
and
it
does
not
cover
this
point
in
the
statute.
it
does
not
cover
those
points
in
the
cases.
next,
there
was
an
objection
to
the
dallas
conviction.
what
they
offered
first
was
the
dallas
indictment.
the
dallas
conviction
was
objected
to.
next,
this
can
happen
again.
this
can
happen
again
for
the
simple
reason
that
even
with
the
two
state's
trial,
the
state
can
still
under
the
present
law
use
these
void
convictions
during
the
punishment
phase
of
the
trial,
unless
the
defendant
has
some
way
in
advance
to
prevent
them
from
doing
so.
after
guilt
has
been
determined
and
you
begin
the
punishment
phase,
the
indictment
is
read
to
the
jury
and
we're
right
back
where
we
started.
mr.
gordon
gooch
i
believe
that
mr.
burgett
was
prejudiced
not
only
on
the
issue
of
punishment
but
also
on
the
issue
of
guilt
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
that's
true,
sir,
but
he'd
still
be
prejudiced
when
the
jury
gives
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
but
it
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
and
the
punishment
since
the
jury
sets
the
punishment.
mr.
gordon
gooch
if
the
court
please,
i
have
to
think
about
that.
i
certainly
would
though
better
than
have
mr.
burgett
spend
the
next
ten
years
of
his
life
with
this
--
in
his
way.
mr.
gordon
gooch
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner,
james
burgett
seeks
the
indication
of
his
right
to
counsel.
he
was
convicted
in
a
texas
state
court
on
a
jury
verdict
of
ten
years.
he
was
--
had
his
conviction
affirmed
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
texas
and
on
his
own
motion
obtained
a
writ
of
certiorari
in
your
court.
he
was
indicted
for
assault
with
intent
to
murder.
the
charges
against
him
were
brought
by
a
jailer
in
the
town
of
greenville,
texas
where
he
was
being
held
for
a
trial.
at
the
time
of
his
trial
as
his
trial
proceeded,
his
court
appointed
counsel
in
greenville
filed
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment
which
alleged
four
prior
convictions
which
the
state
used
to
invoke
one
of
the
habitual
criminal
statutes,
the
result
of
which
would
be
life
imprisonment.
there
was
no
state
procedure
available
before
trial
to
attack
the
prior
convictions.
the
motion
to
quash
as
set
out
in
the
statutes
applied
only
to
technical
features
of
the
indictment
such
as
an
illegally
constituted
grand
jury.
nevertheless,
the
court
appointed
lawyer
moved
to
quash,
stating
that
he
didn't
have
enough
information
to
make
any
further
attack.
there
was
no
action
taken
insofar
as
the
record
is
concerned
on
his
motion
to
quash
but
the
counsel
really
couldn't
expect
the
court
to
take
any
motion
since
the
texas
law
was
clear
that
the
defendant
was
not
entitled
to
have
copies
of
the
prior
convictions
that
were
going
to
be
used
against
him
and
that
the
defendant
was
not
entitled
to
object
prior
to
trial
to
the
use
of
any
prior
conviction,
instead
he
had
to
make
his
objection
in
front
of
the
jury.
as
the
trial
began,
the
state
read
the
indictment
and
the
jury
was
told
that
petitioner
was
duly
and
legally
convicted
on
four
prior
occasions.
as
the
evidence
came
in,
the
state
introduced
into
evidence
one
version,
first
of
one
of
the
tennessee
convictions
alleged.
that
conviction
stated
on
its
face
that
petitioner
did
not
have
counsel.
there
was
a
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
forgery
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
your
honor.
the
conviction
recited
on
his
face
that
he
had
appeared
in
court
without
counsel
and
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
counsel
had
been
tendered
to
him
or
that
he
had
waived
counsel.
his
court
appointed
lawyer
objected
on
the
ground
that
the
conviction
showed
on
its
face
that
petitioner
did
not
have
counsel
and
that
there
was
no
indication
of
waiver
which
brought
him
squarely
within
carnley
against
cochran.
secondly,
he
raised
the
issue
of
course
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
judge
reserved
ruling
and
the
state
offered
the
same
conviction
and
evidence,
this
time,
a
different
and
inconsistent
certified
copy
of
the
same
conviction.
the
second
version
did
not
have
a
recitation
that
counsel
was
not
present.
it
was
simply
silent
on
whether
counsel
was
present.
again,
there
was
no
language
in
the
second
certified
copy
of
the
same
conviction
to
indicate
that
petitioner
had
been
tendered
counsel
or
that
he
had
waived
counsel.
the
court
then
proceeded
to
receive
evidence
again
without
making
a
ruling
and
again
over
counsel's
objections,
proceeded
to
hear
evidence
concerning
a
texas
conviction
for
burglary,
the
preceding
in
1964.
the
judge
after
a
hearing,
partially
in
camara,
ruled
out
the
texas
conviction
on
the
ground
that
it
was
void
on
state
law
grounds.
he
did
not
admit
the
first
version
of
the
tennessee
conviction
that
recited
that
petitioner
was
of
--
without
counsel.
he
did
admit
into
evidence
the
second
inconsistent
version
of
the
tennessee
conviction
stating
--
overruling
defendant's
objections,
the
trial
proceeding.
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
record
to
indicate
what
happened
until
the
court's
charge
in
which
the
court
charged
the
jury
that
they
had
heard
certain
evidence
that
tended
to
show
that
the
defendant
had
been
guilty
of
previous
crimes
and
that
they
were
not
to
consider
that
for
any
purpose.
mr.
gordon
gooch
sir,
the
other
two
tennessee
convictions
were
never
directly
offered
into
evidence.
however,
the
tennessee
conviction
that
was
offered
and
admitted
into
evidence
contained
their
recital
concerning
one
of
the
other
tennessee
convictions
with
the
language
that
he'd
be
rendered
infamous
and
incapable
of
giving
testimony
(inaudible)
language
of
that
nature.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
a
blanket
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
your
honor
they
say
--
the
judge
instructed
them,
the
jury,
not
to
consider
the
evidence
that
they
had
heard
concerning
any
of
the
--
pending
to
show
prior
crimes,
i
believe
is
the
language
he
used.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
your
honor.
they
were
instructed
that
the
allegations
and
the
indictment
were
no
evidence
originally
and
also
specifically
in
this
connection.
mr.
gordon
gooch
two.
two,
two
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
--
that
were
admit
--
in
which
there
were
no
certified
copies
at
all
even
tendered
to
the
court.
mr.
gordon
gooch
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
like
to
place
myself
now
in
the
shoes
of
the
district
attorney
in
this
rural
county
of
texas
just
before
petitioner's
trial.
he
was
indicted
early
in
april
of
1965
on
this
habitual
criminal
charge
to
be
tried
later
that
month.
as
evidence,
i
as
the
district
attorney
have
four
alleged
prior
convictions.
now,
only
two
are
required
under
the
texas
act
but
i
decided
to
use
four
prior
convictions
which
i
am
permitted
to
do
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
i
look
at
this
convictions
and
i
see
that
at
least
one
tennessee
conviction
that
i'm
going
to
offer
in
evidence
is
inconsistent.
i
have
their
--
i
do
not
know
and
cannot
tell
which
is
the
true
certified
copy
of
the
tennessee
conviction.
but
this
i
can
see
that
on
the
certified
copy
of
the
conviction
that
i'm
going
to
offer
in
evidence
it
affirmatively
states
that
petitioner
was
without
counsel.
and
also,
there
is
nothing
in
any
of
the
convictions
or
any
of
the
papers
certified
under
civil
secretary
of
state
of
tennessee
or
of
the
clerk
to
indicate
that
petitioner
was
offered
counsel
or
that
he
waived
his
right
to
counsel.
as
the
case
goes
to
trial,
my
opponent
files
a
motion
asking
to
see
--
asking
for
more
information
about
this
convictions
that
i'm
going
to
offer
in
evidence.
i
do
not
have
to
give
it
to
him
and
i
don't
give
it
to
him.
instead,
i
make
him
make
an
objection
in
front
of
the
jury
after
i've
already
read
the
indictment
to
him
and
an
indictment
to
the
jury,
i
make
my
opponent
object
in
front
of
a
jury
and
assert
at
that
time
petitioner's
constitutional
rights.
the
first
opportunity
really
that
petitioner's
counsel
had.
the
trial
judge
admits
the
conviction
and
the
trial
proceeds.
the
jury
is
never
told
that
petitioner
was
never
validly
convicted.
they're
simply
instructed
at
that
late
date
not
at
the
time
the
evidence
was
offered
but
at
the
time
of
the
charge
not
to
consider.
i
don't
see
how
any
lawyer
reading
carnley
against
cochran
and
gideon
against
wainwright,
could
reach
the
conclusion
that
those
convictions
could
--
were
valid
and
could
be
used
in
evidence
against
petitioner
or
could
be
used
to
invoke
the
habitual
criminal
act
of
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
gordon
gooch
if
the
court
please,
i
cannot
honestly
say
that
for
this
reason
insofar
as
the
record
before
this
court
is
concerned
there
is
no
indication
that
petitioner
waived
counsel.
if
i
were
permitted
to
testify
based
on
what
petitioner
told
me,
i
would
say
that
he
was
not
tendered
counsel
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
--
and
he
did
not
waive
it.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
by
the
same
token,
the
state
of
texas
never
contended
in
the
trial
court
that
there
was
any
waiver.
they
never
contended
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
that
petitioner
waived
counsel.
in
response
to
petitioner's
petition,
they
conceded
that
their
proof
failed
because
respondent
did
not
have
counsel
in
tennessee
and
only
in
their
brief
that
they
include
as
exhibits
two
affidavits
filed
long
after
the
record
were
certified
in
this
court
purporting
to
be
affidavits
of
the
trial
judge
and
the
district
attorney,
reciting
the
conclusion
that
petitioner
waived
counsel.
i
was
given
no
notice
that
these
affidavits
were
going
to
be
taken.
i
was
given
no
opportunity
to
cross-examine
these
state's
witnesses.
petitioner
was
given
no
opportunity
to
confront
these
witnesses
against
him
and
petitioner
was
given
no
hearing
in
which
his
credibility
could
be
placed
in
context
with
these
affidavits.
mr.
gordon
gooch
sir,
i
believe
the
court's
already
said
that
in
carnley
against
cochran
expressly
that
unless
there
is
an
allegation
or
evidence
of
waiver
or
unless
the
judgment
itself
shows
waiver,
the
conviction
is
void.
and
petitioner's
counsel
did
all
that
he
had
to
do
under
carnley
against
cochran
to
throw
the
burden
back
on
the
state
by
pointing
out
that
the
--
there
is
an
affirmative
showing
of
no
counsel
and
no
showing
of
waiver.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
gooch
now,
with
this
evidence
before
the
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
your
honor.
that's
very
true
and
i
was
remising
that
--
calling
it
to
your
attention.
under
the
state
law,
he
may
allege
as
many
as
he
wishes
and
may
use
them
as
he
sees
them.
mr.
gordon
gooch
and
the
standard
on
appeal
on
those
cases
provides
no
relief
that
the
penalty
is
not
enhanced
which
is
exactly
the
position
taken
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
on
appeal.
they
would
not
let
mr.
burgett
even
have
his
case
considered
because,
under
their
own
decisions,
unless
the
penalty
has
actually
been
enhanced,
the
petitioner
has
no
standing
to
complain
about
the
use
of
the
prior
convictions
and
evidence
against
him.
in
particular,
the
case
that
they
relied
on,
their
most
recent
case,
the
defendant
was
given
99
years
instead
of
life
imprisonment
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
held
that
he
had
no
standing
to
complain
because
he
only
got
99
years
instead
of
life
under
the
enhanced
statute.
so
based
on
appeal
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
with
no
prospect
of
securing
consideration
of
his
claim
that
his
trial
jury
was
prejudiced
by
this
evidence
being
alleged
in
the
indictment
read
to
him,
offered
into
evidence
and
then
only
slightly
cured
if
it
all
by
the
instruction
of
the
court.
if
the
court
please,
this
is
strictly
in
violation
of
your
rule
in
chapman
against
california
which
requires
when
there's
unconstitutionally
obtained
or
used
evidence
comes
into
the
trial
if
the
state
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
it
did
not
contribute
to
the
result
in
this
case.
so
the
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
your
honor,
you
--
we
really
do
not
know
what
happened.
we
don't
know
really
why?
mr.
gordon
gooch
it
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
gooch
sir,
i
don't
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
i
don't
believe
that
mr.
burgett's
case
necessarily
stands
or
falls
on
that
point
but
it
is
an
important
consideration.
and
under
standard
set
by
this
court
in
the
last
century,
it
is
clear
that
when
evidence,
highly
prejudicial
evidence,
the
court
is
--
can
consider
and
should
consider
whether
or
not
the
jury
could
possibly
obey
the
court's
instructions.
and
in
this
connection,
i'd
like
to
point
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
that
--
yes,
sir,
that
is
one
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
--
reason
why
i
should
win.
mr.
gordon
gooch
the
first
reason
is
that
the
--
he
should've
had
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
to
have
this
evidence
stricken
before
the
jury
ever
heard
it.
secondly,
and
after
the
jury
heard
it,
there
is
no
way
that
the
instruction
by
the
court
would
be
effective
to
erase
this
from
their
minds.
mr.
gordon
gooch
absolutely
sir.
i
believe
that
spencer
simply
permits
a
one
stage
recidivist
proceeding
when
there
is
no
question
that
the
convictions
to
be
used
against
the
man
are
valid.
and
all
spencer
did,
if
the
court
please,
is
to
permit
texas
to
use
a
one
stage
recidivist
proceedings
and
to
use
in
evidence
before
the
guilt
has
determined
a
valid
prior
conviction
or
valid
prior
convictions.
spencer's
case
is
not
petitioner's
case
because
the
state
had
no
valid
prior
convictions.
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
if
the
court
please,
he
is
spending
ten
years
of
his
life
that
he
might
not
have
to
if
the
people
who
sentenced
him,
who
sentenced
him
under
no
standards
given
by
the
court
just
a
range
of
punishment
were
not
prejudiced
by
the
fact
that
they
had
information
that
they
couldn't
possibly
put
out
of
their
mind
as
to
four
prior
convictions
duly
and
legally
convicted.
and
as
the
second
circuit
held
under
rotier
against
labely
(ph),
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
recidivism
free
from
the
taint
of
this
void
prior
convictions
that
the
state,
really,
i
don't
believe
can
sustain
their
burden
of
showing
that
it
had
no
effect
at
all
on
the
jury's
ten
year
sentence.
in
texas,
cold
blooded
murder
premeditated
can
receive
two
years
probated
sentence.
mr.
gordon
gooch
i
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
he
was
advised
that
the
first
opportunity
petitioner's
counsel
had
when
he
was
offered
into
evidence.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
no,
sir.
the
objection
was
to
exclude
it
and
the
objection
was
overruled.
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
it
may
well
be
your
honor.
i
don't
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
your
honor
and
the
charge
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
for
any
purpose,
yes,
sir.
but
they
were
told
that
the
prior
--
that
evidence
of
prior
crimes
should
not
be
considered
and
the
convictions
and
not
the
indictment,
they
weren't
ever
told
that
the
man
never
had
been
convicted
insofar
as
the
state
was
really
concerned.
they
were
simply
instructed
to
disregard
it.
now
the
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
if
the
court
please,
i
--
if
so,
i
have
overlooked
it
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
all
of
the
circuits
have
considered
this
question
have
had
no
difficulty
in
stating
that
the
defendant
does
have
a
right
to
make
a
collateral
attack.
the
only
alternative
is
to
insulate
the
judgment
from
attack
and
let
him
suffer
the
harm.
let
him
go
back
to
the
other
state
and
attack
it
which
he
probably
can't
do
and
in
texas
is
not
permitted
to
do.
and
in
fact,
in
texas,
he's
not
even
permitted
to
tell
the
jury
that
he
is
attacking
in
a
sister
state,
his
prior
conviction
on
the
ground
that
they
--
it
was
obtained
unconstitutionally.
the
only
alternative
is
to
say
that
once
you
have
an
out
of
state
conviction
that
the
man
cannot
challenge
it
at
all
and
he
has
to
suffer
whatever
penalty
is
--
because
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
a
position
that
the
court
want
to
take.
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
in
all
of
the
circuit
courts
that
have
held
on
this,
that
has
presented
no
problem.
and
in
--
specifically,
united
states
against
jackson
considered
the
difficulties
that
the
state
may
have
in
making
this
kind
of
proof
but
the
alternatives
are
simply
to
deny
the
man
any
opportunity
to
make
a
challenge.
mr.
gordon
gooch
no,
sir.
i'm
not
aware
of
the
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
you
said
tuning
your
honor?
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
the
tuning
if
i
read
it
correctly
your
honor,
it
depends
on
the
restraints
that
are
being
placed
on
the
man
presently.
it
may
well
be
that
tennessee
would
have
to
give
him
a
hearing.
but
more
importantly,
texas
should
give
him
the
hearing.
texas
is
much
of
a
position
to
determine
this
as
anyone
else.
if
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
it's
i
think
an
entirely
different
case
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
but
it's
a
more
aggravated
case
when
the
judge
actually
had
missed
the
evidence
and
waits
till
the
end
of
the
trial
to
exclude
it.
it
has
a
more
damaging
effect
on
the
jury.
mr.
gordon
gooch
if
the
court
please,
i
ask
no
more
than
you
permitted
in
jackson
against
denno.
mr.
gordon
gooch
that
is
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
that
is
one
alternative
as
--
actually,
this
is
evidence
that's
coming
in,
unconstitutionally
obtained
evidence
and
i
don't
see
any
distinction
why
this
evidence
shouldn't
be
challenged
in
camara
as
much
as
other
evidence
is
challenged
in
camara.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
gordon
gooch
no
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
only
in
terms
of
aggravation
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
gordon
gooch
as
long
as
it's
unconstitutionally
obtained
evidence.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
gooch
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
so.
he
was
indicted
for
that
and
they're
recited
in
the
judgment
that
he
was
convicted
repetition
of
offense
but
from
the
sentence
that
he
received,
he
did
not
receive
enhanced
punishment.
so
i
really
believe
that's
a
clerical
error
although
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
he
was
convicted
as
a
criminal
repeater.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
no,
i
perhaps
tried
to
compress
too
much
in
one
sentence.
the
jury
would
never
--
was
not
charged
on
the
habitual
criminal.
well,
you
say,
were
only
charged
on
assault
with
intent
to
murder
in
a
lesser
included
offenses.
they
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
in
ten
years.
the
judge,
when
he
entered
the
formal
conviction
against
the
road
on
the
face
of
the
conviction,
convicted
assault
with
intent
to
murder
repetition
of
offense.
so
insofar
as
the
formal
judgment
of
conviction
is
before
you,
it
reads
assault
with
intent
to
murder,
repetition
of
offense.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
it
does.
mr.
gordon
gooch
well,
there's
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
there's
no
question
that
that
is
true
insofar
as
the
record
is
concerned.
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
that's
what
the
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
not
a
sentence,
a
conviction.
sentence
was
not
enhanced.
mr.
gordon
gooch
no,
sir.
but
the
conviction
before
you
is
a
conviction
for
assault
with
intent
to
murder,
repetition
of
offense.
mr.
gordon
gooch
he
was
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes,
sir.
and
that
--
the
jury
does
--
was
not
asked
a
question
concerning
whether
or
not
this
man
was
convicted
of
other
crimes
which
would
have
been
the
procedure
otherwise.
now,
i
wish
--
i
would
like
to
save
a
little
time
in
rebuttal.
i
do
wish
to
make
one
other
statement
and
that
is
that
petitioner
was
not
given
the
opportunity
to
be
present
when
the
prosecution
conducted
the
voir
dire
examination
of
the
jury
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
with
--
it's
very
clear
or
how
critical
--
critically
important
it
is
for
the
man
to
be
sitting
there
so
he
can
observe
the
jury
when
the
prosecutor
is
asking
the
questions,
so
that
he
can
form
a
basis
of
who's
going
to
be
leading
which
way
so
he
and
his
lawyer
can
have
an
adequate
opportunity
to
strike
the
people
that
they
think
are
against
them
from
the
start.
so
that
the
petitioner
can
be
assured
when
the
jury
gets
in
the
box
that
he
hadn't
even
started
with
the
prosecution
and
that
he
knows
as
the
best
that
you
can
know
that
he
is
going
to
get
a
fair
shake
of
the
jury.
mr.
gordon
gooch
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
to
make
several
points
in
a
short
time.
first,
i'd
like
to
say
is
that
mr.
douglas
i
believe
gave
you
the
order
backwards.
the
tennessee
convictions
were
offered
first
and
the
judge
did
not
preclude
any
evidence
coming
in
on
the
tennessee
convictions
that
were
offered.
the
judge
specifically
said
that
he
would
reserve
his
rulings
until
the
district
attorney
offered
all
evidence
that
he
was
going
to
offer.
and
when
the
district
attorney
--
this
is
on
page
36
to
41
in
the
record.
secondly,
obviously
then
the
state
was
not
prevented
from
making
any
proof
they
cared
to
make
in
connection
with
the
tennessee
conviction
that
was
admitted
in
the
evidence.
third,
i
don't
see
how
they
conceivably
could
make
this
a
life
sentence
case
not
only
with
these
convictions
but
also
in
the
brief
they
argued
because
the
jury
knew
that
the
defendant
was
in
jail,
that
the
jury
could
take
that
evidence
into
consideration
and
impose
a
life
sentence.
the
plain
truth
is
he
wasn't
even
convicted
at
the
time
that
he
was
held
in
jail.
next,
the
offer
to
stipulate
the
choice
that
the
defendant
has
to
make
is
--
make
these
constitutional
objections
in
front
of
the
jury
suffer
the
prejudice
are
stipulated
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
when
the
state
has
the
right
to
require
the
defendant
to
put
on
any
evidence
that
he
has
about
punishment
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury.
but
the
defendant
doesn't
have
that
right,
only
the
state.
we
only
ask
that
the
odds
be
evened
a
little
bit.
secondly,
the
motion
to
quash
the
indictment
does
not
go
to
striking
prior
convictions.
it's
simply
to
the
form
and
substance,
the
content
and
it
does
not
cover
this
point
in
the
statute.
it
does
not
cover
those
points
in
the
cases.
next,
there
was
an
objection
to
the
dallas
conviction.
what
they
offered
first
was
the
dallas
indictment.
the
dallas
conviction
was
objected
to.
next,
this
can
happen
again.
this
can
happen
again
for
the
simple
reason
that
even
with
the
two
state's
trial,
the
state
can
still
under
the
present
law
use
these
void
convictions
during
the
punishment
phase
of
the
trial,
unless
the
defendant
has
some
way
in
advance
to
prevent
them
from
doing
so.
after
guilt
has
been
determined
and
you
begin
the
punishment
phase,
the
indictment
is
read
to
the
jury
and
we're
right
back
where
we
started.
mr.
gordon
gooch
i
believe
that
mr.
burgett
was
prejudiced
not
only
on
the
issue
of
punishment
but
also
on
the
issue
of
guilt
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
yes
sir.
mr.
gordon
gooch
that's
true,
sir,
but
he'd
still
be
prejudiced
when
the
jury
gives
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
but
it
--
mr.
gordon
gooch
and
the
punishment
since
the
jury
sets
the
punishment.
mr.
gordon
gooch
if
the
court
please,
i
have
to
think
about
that.
i
certainly
would
though
better
than
have
mr.
burgett
