justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
the
same
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
later
stricken,
and
you
say,
were
you
--
that
he
--
the
objection
to
the
evidence
was
overruled
but
later
it
was
stricken?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
jury
was
told
not
to
consider
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
there
a
case
here
in
which
--
reconsidered
in
virginia
that
the
--
is
constitutionally
required
that
the
state
allow
a
--
an
attack
on
a
prior
conviction
during
a
subsequent
recidivist
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
gather
your
position
would
be
to
--
if
you
put
yourself
back
in
the
shoes
of
the
state's
attorney,
he
wants
to
offer
this
prior
crime
and
he
offers
them
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
the
jury
hears
them
and
the
judge
excludes
them
and
he
gives
an
instruction.
you
should
come
up
here
with
the
same
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
wouldn't
you?
the
jury
has
heard
the
fact
to
the
--
of
the
claim
prior
conviction.
the
judge
says
that,
“well,
that
man
was
convicted
without
counsel.
i
exclude
it.”
the
jury
--
the
judge
wouldn't
necessarily
follow
from
your
position
that
you
must
have
a
separate
hearing
on
the
admissibility
of
this
evidence
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
do
agree
that
you'd
be
up
here
making
the
same
argument
or
at
least
the
same
kind
of
argument
if
the
evidence
had
been
excluded.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
understand.
you
want
to
apply
that
jackson
against
denno
procedure
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
a
prior
crime.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
--
i
would
say
that
he
would
apply
the
same
rule
to
any
kind
of
unconstitutionality,
i
think,
regardless
of
its
--
of
the
variety
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
of
the
differences
between
evidence
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
terms
of
its
impact
on
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
--
so
you
won't
distinguish
between
one
kind
of
evidence
and
another
in
terms
of
its
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
power
of
a
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
don't
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
brief
says
that
the
court
didn't
admit
the
texas
conviction
and
so
that's
what
records
meant
to
show.
had
a
hearing
and
they
excluded
it
--
excluded
that,
they
admitted
the
one
--
(inaudible)
--
the
one
version
of
tennessee
conviction
which
was
later
withdrawn.
justice
byron
r.
white
what,
dallas,
the
dallas
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
case
did
you
cite
a
while
ago
as
well
as
spencer,
was
it
michelson
or
mickelson
or
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
in
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
that's
alright.
thank
you
very
much.
justice
byron

that's
the
