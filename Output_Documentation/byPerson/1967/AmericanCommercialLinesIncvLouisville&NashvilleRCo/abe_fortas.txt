justice
abe
fortas
as
i
understand
it,
you
--
your
submission
is
based
on
the
proposition
that
the
statute
confines
the
commission
to
comparative
cost
advantages
however
they
maybe
defined.
you
listed
four
points
and
every
one
of
them
had
to
do
with
the
comparative
cost.
justice
abe
fortas
i
--
i
understand
that
but
i
say
that
how
about
other
competitive
factors
or
larger
factors
that
relate
to
a
competitive
situation
or
other
element
stated
in
the
national
transportation
policy,
are
those
out
in
this
kind
of
case?
justice
abe
fortas
this
kind
of
case?
justice
abe
fortas
but
well
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
just
said
--
you
just
listed
four
factors.
justice
abe
fortas
and
every
one
of
them
had
to
do
with
cost
comparison.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
my
question
to
you
is
as
the
commission
construes
and
applies
the
statute
in
determining
a
case
of
this
sort
comparing
railroad
and
barge-truck
service.
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
commission
confine
itself
to
--
compared
to
cost
factors
or
does
it
take
into
account
other
elements?
if
it
takes
into
account
other
elements,
what
are
they
and
did
it
do
so
here?
justice
abe
fortas
when
you
say
they
are
not
involved
here,
you
mean
the
commission
didn't
take
it
into
account.
it
didn't
place
any
emphasis
on
them.
is
that
what
you're
saying,
so
far
as
what
the
commission
did
here
that
based
solely
on
cost
comparison?
justice
abe
fortas
although
there
are
other
statutory
standards
that
are
relevant
and
that
define
the
commission's
power,
are
you
saying
that
too?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
not
what
i
ask
you.
i
said,
are
there
other
statutory
standards
that
are
relevant
to
the
exercise
of
the
commission's
power
in
this
type
of
situation?
justice
abe
fortas
which
says
what
as
replied
in
here?
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
the
commission
also
required
to
take
into
account
the
preservation
of
the
two
--
of
the
competing
modes?
what
is
that
language
of
the
transportation
policy?
justice
abe
fortas
in
your
brief?
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
commission
take
into
account
a
promotion
of
a
sound,
adequate,
economic
and
efficient
service
in
determining
this
kind
of
issue?
does
it
or
does
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
but
it
did
not
here?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
i
would
assume
that
rate
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
whether
the
barge
lines
for
example
will
survive
and
well,
on
the
other
end
whether
the
railroads
will
survive.
but
you
tell
me
that
all
the
commission
does
here
regardless
of
this
broad
statutory
language
is
to
take
into
account
the
comparative
cost
factors.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
sorry,
i
tried
to
make
it
clear
but
i
obviously
haven't
succeeded.
justice
abe
fortas
well
now,
did
the
commission
take
that
into
account
in
this
case
or
not?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
why
did
you
say
it
took
into
account
only
the
cost
factors?
or
do
i
misunderstand
you
totally?
justice
abe
fortas
yesterday,
i
discussed
with
the
counsel
who
preceded
you
what
the
applicable
standards
were.
in
your
judgment
as
you
understand
it,
are
the
standards
that
govern
a
case
of
this
sort
before
the
commission
confined
to
a
comparison
of
cost
or
whatever
type
of
cost
--
whatever
type
of
cost
it
might
be?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
that's
not
my
question.
as
you
read
the
statute,
what
--
is
that
the
only
standard
that
the
commission
may
or
is
required
to
take
into
account
in
deciding
a
case
of
this
sort?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
that
is
because
of
the
statement
of
policy
in
the
national
transportation
act
and
the
standards
of
the
national
--
the
national
transportation
policy
is
made
an
applicable
standard
to
this
kind
of
a
proceeding
by
expressed
language
of
158
--
justice
abe
fortas
now,
are
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
right.
alright.
now,
lets'
--
let
me
see
if
i
can
get
this
clear
in
my
own
mind,
if
you
don't
mind.
the
commission
has
to
take
into
account
the
cost
factors,
which
is
what
you've
been
discussing.
the
commission
should
under
the
statute
also
take
into
account
the
relevant
parts
of
the
national
transportation
policy,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
my
next
question
is
did
the
commission
here
take
into
account
not
only
the
cost
factors
but
also
some
considerations
with
respect
to
the
national
transportation
policy?
justice
abe
fortas
and
if
it
did
so,
could
you,
without
too
much
spending
a
lot
of
time,
show
me
just
where
in
the
commission's
opinion
it
did
take
that
into
account?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
now,
may
i
ask
you
at
some
point
during
the
course
of
the
total
argument
to
hand
the
clerk
a
statement
of
the
reference
to
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
appendix
--
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
but
doesn't
the
statute
commit
all
of
that
to
the
icc
and
not
to
the
department
of
justice?
justice
abe
fortas
now
what
you
have,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
very
heavy
burden
of
showing
that
the
commission
has
exceeded
its
powers
under
the
law
or
has
misapplied
them
that
the
economic
judgment,
as
i
understand
it
in
these
cases,
is
an
economic
judgment
for
the
icc
to
make.
now,
let
me
ask
you
whether
as
you
read
this
statute,
the
only
factors
that
are
covered
in
here
are
compared
to
cost
factors
however
they
may
be
interpreted,
or
whether
the
national
transportation
policy
has
to
be
--
under
the
statute
has
to
be
considered.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
next
question,
do
you
--
what
do
you
make
of
the
paragraph
in
the
commission's
opinion
on
page
68
of
the
joint
appendix
which
the
commission
says
an
inherent
cost
advantage
under
the
national
transportation
policy
reasonably
could
not
embrace
a
concept
that
would
impair
the
ability
of
a
character
--
of
a
carrier
not
only
to
compete
but
to
exist.
now,
are
you
--
is
or
is
not
that
an
appropriate
standard
and
do
you
attack
that
finding
as
unsupported
by
the
evidence
here?
justice
abe
fortas
because
i
think
there
could
be
only
one
agency
that
would
exercise
debatable
economic
judgments
on
behalf
of
the
unites
states
government.
and
as
i
read
the
statute,
that
agency
is
the
icc.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
there
are
two
things.
are
there
--
this
is
my
first
question
--
are
there
two
things
of
cost
factors
in
the
national
transportation
policy
or
do
you
dispute
that?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
but
are
there
other
factors
in
the
national
transportation
policy
that
the
statute
commands
a
or
b
permits
the
commission
to
take
into
account?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
did
the
commission
take
into
account
here
factors
other
than
the
cost
factors?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
do
you
make
of
page
68
in
this
paragraph
to
which
the
counsel
who
preceded
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
separate.
that's
not
the
same
thing.
now,
the
commission
did
consider
and
it
did
take
into
account
the
impact
upon
the
barge
lines
and
the
railroads
impacted
the
survival
--
the
survival
impact
of
this
decision
or
the
principal
involved
here,
did
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
you're
saying
is
that
it
took
it
into
account
incorrectly
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
or
improperly.
justice
abe
fortas
incorrectly?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
tell
us
why.
tell
us
why
the
--
do
you
think
that
this
kind
of
allegedly
selective
rate
reduction
by
the
roads
to
compete
with
respect
to
a
particular
segment
of
a
very
complex
traffic
pattern
could
have
no
effect
whatever
on
the
survival
ability
of
either
the
roads
or
the
barge-truck
services?
justice
abe
fortas
what
happened?
is
there
anything
in
the
record
as
to
--
did
those
rates
go
into
effect
the
rail
rates?
justice
abe
fortas
and
is
there
anything
in
the
record
showing
whether
there
was
a
diversion
of
traffic,
this
ingot
traffic
from
the
barges
to
the
railroads?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
do
you
--
now
let's
assume
that
the
record
evidences
that
the
barge
lines
would
lose
this
traffic
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
it
lost
the
traffic.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
now,
are
you
saying
to
us
that
that
evidence
--
we
assume
that
that
is
proof
now.
are
you
saying
to
us
that
that
proof
is
not
sufficient
to
support
the
commission's
finding
or
conclusion
on
page
68
of
the
joint
appendix?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
will
you
please
tell
me
why
you
think
that
the
loss
of
this
traffic
cannot
--
to
the
barge
lines,
cannot
reasonably
be
relied
upon
by
the
commission
as
a
factor
to
disallow
the
railroad
freight
cut
here.
justice
abe
fortas
my
point,
mr.
friedman,
which
i'm
sure
you
anticipate,
is
that
really,
isn't
that
a
judgment
for
the
commission
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
make
that
nice
debatable
--
forgive
me,
a
debatable
judgment
which
you
have
just
made
now?
you
may
be
right,
you
may
be
wrong.
i
don't
know.
but
is
it
your
business
or
our
business
either?
or
is
it
the
business
of
your
commission?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
friedman,
do
i
correctly
understand
that
overall
generally
the
railroads,
the
greater
portion
of
the
railroads
costs,
are
fixed
cost
rather
than
out-of-pocket
cost
as
compared
with
the
barges.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
if
you
took
the
standard
of
out-of-pocket
cost,
the
railroads
would
always
have
a
built-in
advantage
on
the
basis
of
what
you've
been
arguing
to
us.
justice
abe
fortas
why
not?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
why
wouldn't
they
have
the
advantage.
there
is
an
enormous
spread
between
the
total
cost
including
fixed
as
well
as
out-of-pocket
cost
and
just
the
out-of-pocket
cost.
justice
abe
fortas
so
what
you're
really
doing
is
saying
that
in
every
case
the
commission
has
to
--
has
to
allow
the
railroads
the
right
to
lower
prices
to
cut
their
rates
within
that
marginal
area.
that's
the
thrust
of
your
argument.
you
maybe
right,
you
may
be
wrong
as
a
matter
of
economics.
as
a
matter
of
paying
out
the
national
transportation
policy
but
i
really
wonder
if
that
isn't
a
matter
for
the
icc
and
not
for
this
court
and
not
if
i
may
respectfully
say
so
for
the
department
of
justice.
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
really
saying
if
i
correctly
understand
this.
the
thrust
to
what
you're
saying
is
that
anytime
the
railroads
want
to
do
it,
they
can
cut
prices
within
this
marginal
area
to
a
degree
and
an
extent
that
the
barges
--
barge
lands
cannot
and
take
advantage
of
that
for
the
purpose
of
taking
away
business
from
barge
lines.
justice
abe
fortas
i
couldn't
agree
with
your
more.
i
don't
know
either.
you
don't
know
and
i
don't
know
and
--
but
the
statute
said
that
the
icc
ought
to
know
or
if
it
doesn't
know
that
we're
all
in
a
bad
fix
because
it's
got
the
power
and
the
duty.
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
understand
it,
you
--
your
submission
is
based
on
the
proposition
that
the
statute
confines
the
commission
to
comparative
cost
advantages
however
they
maybe
defined.
you
listed
four
points
and
every
one
of
them
had
to
do
with
the
comparative
cost.
justice
abe
fortas
i
--
i
understand
that
but
i
say
that
how
about
other
competitive
factors
or
larger
factors
that

are
those

this
kind
of
case?
justice
abe
fortas
this
kind
of
case?
justice
abe
fortas
but
well
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
just
said
--
you
just
listed
four
factors.
justice
abe
fortas
and
every
one
of
them
had
to
do
with
cost
comparison.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
my
question
to
you
is
as
the

and
applies
the

does

or
does
it
take
into
account
other
elements?
if
it
takes
into

other
elements,
what
are
they
and
did
it
do
so
here?
justice
abe
fortas
when
you
say
they
are
not
involved
here,
you
mean
the
commission

it

what

a

the

policy?
justice
abe
fortas
and
if
it
did
so,
could
you,
without
too
much
spending
a
lot
of
time,
show
me
just
where
in
the
commission's
opinion
it
did
take
that
into
account?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
now,
may
i
ask
you
at
some
point
during
the
course
of
the
total
argument
to
hand
the
clerk
a
statement
of
the
reference
to
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
appendix
--
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
but
doesn't
the
statute
commit
all
of
that
to
the
icc
and
not
to
the
department
of
justice?
justice
abe
fortas
now
what
you
have,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
very
heavy
burden
of
showing
that
the
commission
has
exceeded
its
powers
under
the
law
or
has
misapplied
them
that
the
economic
judgment,
as
i
understand
it
in
these
cases,
is
an
economic
judgment
for
the
icc
to
make.
now,
let
me
ask
you
whether
as
you
read
this
statute,
the
only
factors
that
are
covered
in
here
are
compared
to
cost
factors
however
they
may
be
interpreted,
or
whether
the
national
transportation
policy
has
to
be
--
under
the
statute
has
to
be
considered.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
next
question,
do
you
--
what
do
you
make
of
the
paragraph
in
the
commission's
opinion
on
page
68
of
the
joint
appendix
which
the
commission
says
an
inherent
cost
advantage
under
the
national
transportation
policy
reasonably
could
not
embrace
a
concept
that
would
impair
the
ability
of
a
character
--
of
a
carrier
not
only
to
compete
but
to
exist.
now,
are
you
--
is
or
is
not
that
an
appropriate
standard
and
do
you
attack
that
finding
as
unsupported
by
the
evidence
here?
justice
abe
fortas
because
i
think
there
could
be
only
one
agency
that
would
exercise
debatable
economic
judgments
on
behalf
of
the
unites
states
government.
and
as
i
read
the
statute,
that
agency
is
the
icc.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
there
are
two
things.
are
there
--
this
is
my
first
question
--
are
there
two
things
of
cost
factors
in
the
national
transportation
policy
or
do
you
dispute
that?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
but
are
there
other
factors
in
the
national
transportation
policy
that
the
statute
commands
a
or
b
permits
the
commission
to
take
into
account?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
did
the
commission
take
into
account
here
factors
other
than
the
cost
factors?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
do
you
make
of
page
68
in
this
paragraph
to
which
the
counsel
who
preceded
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
separate.
that's
not
the
same
thing.
now,
the
commission
did
consider
and
it
did
take
into
account
the
impact
upon
the
barge
lines
and
the
railroads
impacted
the
survival
--
the
survival
impact
of
this
decision
or
the
principal
involved
here,
did
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
you're
saying
is
that
it
took
it
into
account
incorrectly
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
or
improperly.
justice
abe
fortas
incorrectly?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
tell
us
why.
tell
us
why
the
--
do
you
think
that
this
kind
of
allegedly
selective
rate
reduction
by
the
roads
to
compete
with
respect
to
a
particular
segment
of
a
very
complex
traffic
pattern
could
have
no
effect
whatever
on
the
survival
ability
of
either
the
roads
or
the
barge-truck
services?
justice
abe
fortas
what
happened?
is
there
anything
in
the
record
as
to
--
did
those
rates
go
into
effect
the
rail
rates?
justice
abe
fortas
and
is
there
anything
in
the
record
showing
whether
there
was
a
diversion
of
traffic,
this
ingot
traffic
from
the
barges
to
the
railroads?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
do
you
--
now
let's
assume
that
the
record
evidences
that
the
barge
lines
would
lose
this
traffic
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
it
lost
the
traffic.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
now,
are
you
saying
to
us
that
that
evidence
--
we
assume
that
that
is
proof
now.
are
you
saying
to
us
that
that
proof
is
not
sufficient
to
support
the
commission's
finding
or
conclusion
on
page
68
of
the
joint
appendix?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
will
you
please
tell
me
why
you
think
that
the
loss
of
this
traffic
cannot
--
to
the
barge
lines,
cannot
reasonably
be
relied
upon
by
the
commission
as
a
factor
to
disallow
the
railroad
freight
cut
here.
justice
abe
fortas
my
point,
mr.
friedman,
which
i'm
sure
you
anticipate,
is
that
really,
isn't
that
a
judgment
for
the
commission
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
make
that
nice
debatable
--
forgive
me,
a
debatable
judgment
which
you
have
just
made
now?
you
may
be
right,
you
may
be
wrong.
i
don't
know.
but
is
it
your
business
or
our
business
either?
or
is
it
the
business
of
your
commission?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
friedman,
do
i
correctly
understand
that
overall
generally
the
railroads,
the
greater
portion
of
the
railroads
costs,
are
fixed
cost
rather
than
out-of-pocket
cost
as
compared
with
the
barges.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
if
you
took
the
standard
of
out-of-pocket
cost,
the
railroads
would
always
have
a
built-in
advantage
on
the
basis
of
what
you've
been
arguing
to
us.
justice
abe
fortas
why
not?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
why
wouldn't
they
have
the
advantage.
there
is
an
enormous
spread
between
the
total
cost
including
fixed
as
well
as
out-of-pocket
cost
and
just
the
out-of-pocket
cost.
justice
abe
fortas
so
what
you're
really
doing
is
saying
that
in
every
case
the
commission
has
to
--
has
to
allow
the
railroads
the
right
to
lower
prices
to
cut
their
rates
within
that
marginal
area.
that's
the
thrust
of
your
argument.
you
maybe
right,
you
may
be
wrong
as
a
matter
of
economics.
as
a
matter
of
paying
out
the
national
transportation
policy
but
i
really
wonder
if
that
isn't
a
matter
for
the
icc
and
not
for
this
court
and
not
if
i
may
respectfully
say
so
for
the
department
of
justice.
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
really
saying
if
i
correctly
understand
this.
the
thrust
to
what
you're
saying
is
that
anytime
the
railroads
want
to
do
it,
they
can
cut
prices
within
this
marginal
area
to
a
degree
and
an
extent
that
the
barges
--
barge
lands
cannot
and
take
advantage
of
that
for
the
purpose
of
taking
away
business
from
barge
lines.
justice
abe
fortas
i
couldn't
agree
with
your
more.
i
don't
know
either.
you
don't
know
and
i
don't
know
and
--
but
the
statute
said
that
the
icc
ought
to
know
or
if
it
doesn't
know
that
we're
all
in
a
bad
fix
because
it's
got
the
power
and
the
duty.
