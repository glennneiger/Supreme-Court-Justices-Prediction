mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
the
pennsylvania
railroad,
now
the
penn
central
transportation
company
and
other
railroads
sought
to
cut
their
rate
on
ingot
molds
which
are
iron
forms
in
which
molten
steel
is
cast
from
$11.86
per
ton
to
$5.11
per
ton
to
capture
traffic
that
had
moved
for
a
decade
by
combination
barge
and
truck
service.
the
commission
found
that
the
new
railroad
rate
would
impair
an
inherent
cost
advantage
of
the
barge-truck
mode
of
transportation.
the
commission
ordered
the
railroads
to
cancel
the
offending
rate.
the
district
court
of
three
judges
reversed
the
commission's
decision
and
the
commission
is
here
today
on
direct
appeal.
this
is
the
first
rate
case
to
reach
the
courts
involving
the
standards
governing
the
fair
competition
between
regulated
carriers
of
different
modes
of
transportation
since
this
court's
decision
in
the
new
haven
case.
interstate
commerce
commission
versus
new
york,
new
haven
and
hartford
decided
in
1963
reported
in
372
of
the
united
states
reports.
the
new
haven
case
was
the
first
in
which
this
court
addressed
itself
to
the
role
of
the
commission
in
overseeing
rate
competition
among
different
modes
of
transportation
following
the
1958
amendments
to
the
interstate
commerce
act.
like
the
new
haven
case,
the
present
case
involves
the
meaning
of
the
1958
amendment
to
section
15
(a)
(3)
of
the
act.
the
amendment
added
this
language.
rates
of
a
carrier
shall
not
be
held
up
to
a
particular
level
to
protect
the
traffic
of
any
other
mode
of
transportation
giving
due
consideration
to
the
objectives
of
the
national
transportation
policy
declared
in
this
act.
and
the
particular
objective
of
the
transportation
policy
that
is
here
in
issue
again
like
new
haven
is
the
recognition
and
preservation
of
inherent
cost
advantages
as
between
competing
modes
of
transportation.
when
the
present
case
was
before
the
commission,
the
railroads
and
the
barge
lines
followed
strictly
the
format
described
in
the
new
haven
case
for
presenting
the
issue
of
which
mode
possesses
an
inherent
cost
advantage.
the
railroads
first
showed
that
their
newly
reduced
rate
of
$5.11
would
more
than
cover
their
long-term
out
of
pocket
costs
of
$4.69
and
hence
the
reduced
rate
was
just
unreasonable
from
the
standpoint
of
railroad
revenue
requirements.
they
then
showed
their
full
cost
of
carrying
this
traffic
to
be
$7.59
that
is
the
out
of
pocket
cost
of
$4.69
plus
a
share
of
the
constant
expenses
of
running
the
railroad.
the
barge-truck
mode
then
claimed
an
inherent
cost
advantage
and
brought
forth
data
relating
to
its
own
cost.
the
barge-truck
mode
showed
that
the
railroads
were
reducing
their
rate
below
the
barge-truck
full
cost
of
$5.19
and
they
are
on
a
full
cost
basis.
the
barge-truck
mode
possessed
an
inherent
cost
advantage.
the
railroads
countered
by
saying
that
no
cost
comparison
should
be
made.
they
then
said
that
if
one
is
to
be
made,
the
costs
on
the
barge
side
should
include
the
governmental
cost
of
improving
the
water
rights
of
way
or
the
commission
should
ignore
on
the
rail
side
of
the
equation,
all
rail
constant
costs.
the
commission
held
it
would
not
follow
either
of
the
railroads
suggestions.
determination
of
inherent
cost
advantage
requires
a
cost
comparison.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
citing
a
proceeding
in
which
it
had
given
more
detailed
consideration
to
the
question
of
what
costs
are
relevant
to
a
comparison
between
railroads
and
barge
lines,
the
commission
held
that
it
would
adhere
to
a
comparison
of
full
costs
of
the
two
competing
modes
and
down
the
basis
--
on
the
basis
of
such
a
comparison
here
the
rail
rate
impaired
the
barge
lines
low
cost
advantage
and
should
be
cancelled.
when
the
case
came
before
the
lower
court,
the
lower
court
held
agreeing
with
the
railroads
that
no
comparison
of
rates
was
necessary
or
proper
as
a
matter
of
law
since
the
railroad
rate
of
$5.11
more
than
covered
the
rail
out
of
pocket
costs
of
$4.69.
the
court
held
that
as
a
matter
or
law,
the
commission
was
powerless
to
order
the
railroad
rate
cancelled.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
there
was
no
comparable
out
of
pocket
figure
ascertained
on
this
record
for
the
barge
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
in
the
new
automobiles
case,
the
commission
had
a
footnote
to
the
effect
that
the
barge
full
cost
is
approximately
90%
variable
and
the
commission's
formula
with
respect
to
truck
costs
also
relies
upon
a
90%
factor.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
that
means
that
the
out
of
pocket
cost
are
roughly
90%
of
this
$5.19.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
much
higher.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
the
lower
court
cites
the
issue
of
what
costs
are
relevant
to
comparing
cost
of
different
modes
and
of
measuring
inherent
cost
advantages
of
different
modes.
the
opinion
below
contradicted
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
in
relying
upon
what
was
profitable
for
the
proponent
of
the
rate.
section
15
(a)
(3)
requires
the
commission
to
give
due
consideration
to
the
national
transportation
policy.
the
policy
in
turn
requires
the
commission
to
recognize
and
preserve
inherent
advantages
of
each
mode
subject
to
its
regulation.
besides
this
due
consideration
required
on
the
face
of
section
15
(a)
(3),
the
final
sentence
of
the
national
transportation
policy
itself
requires
the
commission
to
administer
the
entire
act
in
accordance
to
the
requirements
of
the
policy.
as
this
court
stated
in
the
schaffer
transportation
case
decided
in
1957,
the
policy
provides
a
yard
stick
by
which
the
correctness
of
the
commission's
action
will
be
measured.
the
commission
could
not
properly
end
its
inquiry
as
the
lower
court
required
us
to
do
with
the
finding
that
the
rate
would
benefit
the
railroads.
the
lower
court's
decision
that
the
commission
was
required
to
end
its
inquiry
with
the
finding
that
the
rate
would
benefit
the
railroads
was
contrary
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
new
haven
case.
this
court
specifically
stated
that
the
commission's
task
does
not
end
upon
finding
that
a
reduced
rate
will
benefit
the
proponent
of
the
rate.
as
this
court
stated
in
the
new
haven
case,
the
precise
example
given
to
the
senate
committee
which
led
to
the
language
adopted
in
1958
was
a
case
in
which
the
railroads
by
establishing
a
compensatory
rate
forced
a
smaller
competing
lower
cost
mode
to
go
below
its
own
fully
distributed
cost
and
thus
perhaps
to
go
out
of
business.
this
court
stated
that
the
principal
purpose
of
the
reference
to
the
national
transportation
policy
that
was
contained
in
section
15
(a)
(3)
was
to
emphasize
the
commission's
power
to
prevent
the
railroads
from
setting
a
rate
which
would
impair
or
destroy
the
inherent
advantages
of
competing
modes
of
transportation
and
the
precise
example
given
by
this
court
of
how
this
impairment
might
occur
in
the
normal
case
was
by
the
railroads
forcing
a
competing
mode
with
a
cost
advantage
on
particular
transportation
to
establish
a
non-profitable
rate
in
order
to
attract
traffic.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i'm
sorry.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
this
court
held
in
new
haven
mr.
justice
harlan
that
the
commission
must
weigh
the
effect
of
the
rail
rate
reduction
on
competing
carriers.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
if
the
précised
question
here
your
honor
is
in
terms
of
how
you
measure
an
inherent
advantage
of
what
group
of
cost
you
used
then
i
would
agree
with
you.
this
was
not
reached
in
new
haven
but
the
lower
court
has
created
a
rule
of
law
that
you
look
only
to
the
profitability
of
this
rate
to
the
proponent
of
the
rate.
now,
that
question
we
submit
was
reached
in
new
haven
and
this
court
held
in
new
haven
that
you
do
not
look
only
to
the
profitability
of
the
rate
to
the
proponent
but
the
commission
has
a
further
task.
now,
the
appellees
in
the
lower
court
rely
heavily
on
the
commission's
1945
decisions
in
the
new
automobiles
case.
of
course
this
court
in
new
haven
referred
to
new
automobiles
as
a
case
whose
result
was
particularly
favored
by
congress
in
1958
but
appellees
in
the
lower
court
received
no
comfort
to
the
new
automobiles
decision.
new
automobiles
was
cited
in
congress
only
for
the
proposition
that
rail
rates
should
not
be
held
up
merely
to
make
certain
that
all
modes
participate
in
the
traffic.
this
is
the
only
principle
of
new
automobiles
that
congress
endorsed
as
this
court
expressly
stated
in
new
haven.
the
new
automobiles
was
cited
by
congress
in
opposition
to
the
cases
in
which
the
commission
had
held
that
in
its
judgment,
certain
rail
reductions
were
lower
than
necessary
to
meet
competition
without
reference
to
inherent
cost
advantages.
and
congress
in
1958
sought
to
give
new
emphasis
to
protecting
these
advantages.
in
looking
only
to
the
costs
of
the
proponent
of
the
rate
to
decide
the
lawfulness
of
the
rate,
the
lower
court
gave
to
the
railroads
in
this
case
what
years
of
law
being
before
congress
had
failed
to
attain.
we
suggest
that
the
ruling
below
does
not
differ
from
two
of
the
so-called
three
shall
nots
which
congress
rejected
in
the
1950s
and
which
this
court
discussed
in
the
new
haven
case.
the
railroads
lobbied
for
years
that
the
commission
and
i
quote,
“shall
not
consider
the
effect
of
such
charge
on
the
traffic
of
any
other
mode
of
transportation
or
the
relation
of
such
charge
to
the
charge
of
any
other
mode
of
transportation.”
these
were
the
first
two
of
the
three
shall
nots.
these
shall
nots
died
in
committee
only
to
be
revived
in
the
ruling
of
the
lower
court.
the
lower
court
sought
to
remove
what
it
called
a
restriction
on
competition
with
its
ruling
and
to
free
the
railroads
to
operate
that
were
beneficial
to
themselves.
the
lower
court
improperly
assumed,
we
submit,
improperly
assumed
that
congress
legislated
in
1958
exclusively
to
further
competition
between
the
modes
of
transportation
and
to
remove
cost
comparisons
from
rate
proceedings.
we
submit
such
is
not
the
case
again
as
this
court
stated
in
new
haven.
the
principle
reason
for
the
reference
back
to
the
national
transportation
policy
in
section
15
(a)
(3)
was
to
emphasize
the
commission's
power
to
prevent
the
railroads
from
impairing
the
inherent
cost
advantages
of
competing
modes
of
transportation
by
rate
cutting.
in
the
new
haven
case,
the
department
of
justice
acknowledged
that
the
commission
must
compare
costs
and
protect
the
carrier
having
the
lower
fully
distributed
costs.
in
fact
so
strongly
did
the
department
believed
that
the
inherent
advantage
of
lower
full
costs
must
be
protected
from
impairment
that
it
would
have
imposed
the
differential
favoring
the
barge
lines
that
had
lower
full
costs.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
this
was
in
the
new
haven
case
in
the
brief
of
the
department
of
justice.
in
terms
of
the
present
facts,
the
department
then
would
have
prohibited
the
railroads
from
charging
anything
less
than
$7.51
on
ingot
molds.
in
contrast,
the
department
has
filed
a
brief
in
the
present
case
arguing
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
carrier
with
a
lower
full
cost
should
be
stripped
of
all
protection
and
the
railroads
may
file
any
rate
that
benefits
themselves
indeed
down
to
$4.69,
the
railroads
own
out
of
pocket
cost
level.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
the
principle
of
the
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
the
government
won
the
new
haven
case
to
the
extent
that
the
government
urged
that
the
commission
should
take
steps
to
protect
the
inherent
cost
advantages
of
the
mode
of
transportation
in
competition
with
the
railroad.
the
same
sort
of
steps
which
the
department
would
now
have
the
commission
abandoned.
strangely,
the
department's
brief
says
nothing
of
this
inconsistency
with
its
new
haven
position.
more
strangely
still
is
the
department's
current
position
contrary
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
new
haven
that
the
commission
has
no
power
either
to
recognize
an
inherent
cost
advantage
on
the
level
other
than
out
of
pocket
cost
or
to
stop
the
railroads
from
making
unduly
lower
rates
that
impair
another
mode's
cost
advantage.
the
department
in
fact
would
ignore
the
commission
has
been
rate
power.
it
would
turn
the
clock
back
about
50
years
when
the
commission
could
only
stop
the
railroads
from
again
increasing
an
unduly
low
rate.
consistent
with
the
prior
decisions,
the
commission
here
found
that
a
comparison
of
the
full
cost
of
each
mode
must
be
made
to
determine
which
mode
has
an
inherent
cost
advantage
and
that
it
would
exercise
its
minimum
rate
power
to
cancel
a
rate
that
impaired
such
an
advantage.
the
congress
have
the
request
of
the
commission
did
not
lay
down
any
test
of
inherent
cost
advantage
as
a
matter
of
law.
significantly,
the
only
time
that
congress
addressed
itself
to
the
question
was
to
consider
whether
full
costs
should
be
adopted
as
a
matter
of
law
for
every
case.
in
new
haven,
this
court
implied
that
a
full
cost
comparison
would
be
an
appropriate
measure
of
inherent
cost
advantages
but
it
stated
explicitly
that
the
choice
among
different
measures
was
one
of
utility
and
one
for
the
commission
to
make.
the
inherent
cost
advantage
that
congress
primarily
concerned
itself
with
was
no
secret
from
the
parties
to
this
case.
senator
wheeler
had
stated
in
1940
during
the
course
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
transportation
act
of
that
year.
when
the
--
and
this
i
quote,
“when
the
bill
speaks
of
inherent
advantages
of
the
shipping
interest,
it
refers
to
carriers
which
can
transport
at
a
cheaper
rate
because
they
can
ship
by
water
by
way
of
canals
and
the
ocean
so
they
have
natural
advantages
and
they
do
not
have
the
expense
of
the
upkeep
of
the
rights
of
way
as
railroads
do.
it
was
this
absence
of
right
of
way
costs
that
congress
specially
sought
to
preserve
as
a
recognized
cost
advantage
of
water
carriers
and
the
railroad
witnesses
in
the
present
case
also
recognize
the
barge
lines
cost
advantage
in
relation
to
the
railroads
only
to
urge
that
the
commission
should
permit
the
railroads
to
defeat
disadvantage.
in
their
view,
the
commission
should
either
ignore
rail
constant
costs
altogether
or
increase
barge
line
costs
by
the
amount
of
the
government
cost
of
improving
the
waterways
and
the
railroads
repeat
on
brief
in
this
court
that
only
some
of
their
right
of
way
costs
should
enter
into
the
comparison.
here,
the
commission
simply
incorporated
the
discussion
of
this
issue
contained
in
the
earlier
green
case.
commission
had
their
help
that
full
cost
has
actually
born
by
the
water
carriers
and
not
hypothetical
costs
should
be
used
to
compare
the
cost
of
railroads
and
water
carriers.
the
congressional
policy
has
been
to
exempt
inland
water
carriers
from
user
charges
and
hence
to
exempt
shippers
by
water
from
paying
for
the
waterways.
the
commission
therefore
refused
to
compare
cost
of
operation
as
if
the
water
carriers
did
in
fact
pay
user
charges.
it
simply
recognized
and
preserved
the
existing
cost
advantage
of
the
water
carriers
and
consistent
with
its
ruling
in
the
green
case.
the
commission
here
both
refused
to
increase
the
water
carrier
cost
by
any
part
of
the
government's
cost
of
building,
improving
or
maintaining
the
inland
waterways
and
refused
to
decrease
the
railroads
cost
to
remove
any
part
of
the
railroad
right
of
way
cost.

mr.

mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
mr.
justice
white,
the
commission
was
not
asked
to
set
a
differential
in
this
case.
the
whole
question
of
service
advantages
was
out
of
the
case.
in
fact,
in
this
decision
and
on
this
record,
the
railroads
are
left
free
to
assert
whatever
service
advantages
they
have.
the
commission's
decision
just
doesn't
reach
your
question.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
it
was
not
raised
as
an
issue
by
any
party.
we
were
not
asked
to
establish
differentials.
we
were
not
asked
to
prescribe
a
railroad
rate.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
not
in
the
present
opinion.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
fully
distributive
cost
of
$7.59.
the
present
opinion
merely
orders
the
railroads
to
cancel
a
rate
of
$5.11.
that's
the
full
scope
of
the
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
depriving
the
barge
lines
of
an
inherent
advantage
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
they
are
the
low
cost
carrier.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
the
full
distributive
cost
of
the
barge
lines,
here
being
$5.19.
if
the
court
please,
the
commission
in
its
report
and
in
its
brief
has
not
stated
that
fully
distributive
costs
are
the
only
measure
of
inherent
cost
advantage
nor
that
full
costs
are
the
only
way
to
protect
the
obvious
inherent
cost
advantages
of
the
barge
lines.
the
commission
in
its
report
refers
to
the
limited
record
before
it.
it
refers
to
the
railroad's
request
for
an
out
of
pocket
standard
that
would
amount
to
a
radical
departure
from
precedent
and
it
states
that
more
detailed
consideration
will
be
given
to
the
entire
question
in
a
broad
rule
making
proceeding
that
is
in
fact
still
pending
before
the
agency.
and
the
commission
in
its
brief
also
shows
that
a
full
cost
comparison
was
not
even
necessary
to
the
result
reached
by
the
commission
that
the
railroads
here
are
the
high
cost
mode
of
transportation
even
if
we
set
to
one
side
the
entire
group
of
railroad
constant
costs
and
draw
from
that
group
only
the
constant
right
of
way
costs
and
add
those
constant
right
of
way
costs
to
the
out
of
pocket
costs
of
the
railroads
even
in
that
sort
of
comparison,
the
railroads
are
the
high
cost
mode
of
transportation.
what
we
do
emphatically
urge
is
this.
first,
that
the
commission's
task
in
overseeing
the
competition
between
railroads
and
other
modes
of
transportation
does
not
end
when
the
commission
has
found
that
a
particular
railroad
rate
is
beneficial
to
the
proponent
railroads.
secondly,
the
commission
must
compare
the
costs
of
competing
carriers
in
order
to
recognize
cost
advantages.
third,
the
task
of
recognizing
and
preserving
inherent
cost
advantages
is
an
administrative
task,
not
a
judicial
task.
and
finally
that
on
this
limited
record,
the
commission
exercised
a
rational
choice
of
full
costs
rather
than
out
of
pocket
cost
in
making
this
comparison
of
costs
and
rationally
held
that
the
rail
rate
reduction
below
the
barge-truck
full
cost
level
unlawfully
impair
the
low
cost
advantage
enjoyed
by
the
barge-truck
mode.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
this
case
involves
in
a
question
of
service
advantages.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
oh,
no.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
by
no
means,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
they're
not
out.
they're
not
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
true.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
the
other
elements
are
as
you
have
stated
mr.
justice
fortas
listed
in
the
national
transportation
policy
and
in
section
15
(a)
(3)
but
they
were
not
--
they're
not
involved
in
this
case.
this
is
a
very
narrow
case
involving
the
protection
of
the
carrier
cost
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
there
is
some
--
i
think
that's
accurate.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i
say
that
no
other
statutory
standards
are
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
section
15
(1)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
which
involves
a
--
the
commission's
power
to
prescribe,
to
determine
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
is
involved
and
that
we
are
not
limited
to
a
section
4
sort
of
power
in
which
we
can
only
limit
a
railroad
after
the
fact
and
not
permit
the
railroad
to
increase
a
rate.
in
other
words,
under
section
15,
we
can't
--
we
do
have
power
over
--
we
have
a
minimum
rate
power.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
recognize
--
it's
on
page
3
of
the
government's
brief.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
page
3.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes,
it
does
in
certain
cases.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
this
case
does
not
involve
the
rendition
of
a
particular
service.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
oh!
no.
i
understand
your
question
and
i'm
sorry.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
now,
there
are
findings
in
this
report
and
the
commission
has
stated
that
the
rail
rate
would,
in
addition
to
impairing
a
cost
advantage
of
the
barge
lines,
also
lead
to
a
destruction
of
the
barge
lines
that
in
that
sense,
it
is
a
--
it
is
destructive
of
the
barge
service.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
the
cost
factor
also
determines
the
type
of
consideration
that
the
commission
gave
to
the
destructiveness
of
the
competition
here.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
in
the
guise
of
asking
more
findings
from
the
commission,
the
department
and
the
appellees
generally
would
impose
a
rule
of
law
on
the
commission.
in
their
view,
the
commission
must
permit
the
railroads
to
decrease
their
rates
within
this
margin
between
full
cost
and
out-of-pocket
cost
in
the
discretion
of
the
railroads.
the
counsel
for
the
railroads
has
stated
to
this
court,
the
commission
had
no
concern
with
the
effect
on
the
barge
lines.
now,
i
wish
to
emphasize
very
strongly
that
affirming
the
lower
court's
decision
means
that
this
court
affirms
that
rule
of
law
and
our
reason
for
appeal
was
to
overturn
that
rule
of
law.
now,
the
appellees
urge
that
this
particular
rate
that
was
before
the
commission
would
not
seriously
affect
the
barge
lines
while
the
commission's
judgment
differed.
its
judgment
differed
with
respect
both
to
the
effectiveness
rate
on
the
barge
lines
and
with
respect
to
the
effect
of
this
practice,
this
measure
of
inherent
advantage
that
the
railroads
espoused
the
effect
of
this
practice
on
the
barge
lines.
further,
the
commission's
findings
in
this
case
are
indeed
sufficient
to
support
the
commission's
full
cost
standard.
now,
i
believe
the
counsel
for
the
department
inadvertently
state
to
this
court
that
the
commission
had
not
even
considered
service
advantages.
if
the
court
please,
at
pages
40
and
43
of
the
record,
there
are
findings
there
concerning
the
service
advantages
and
findings
to
the
effect
that
service
advantages
are
not
determinative
of
the
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
your
honor
in
this
case,
it
was
a
difference
in
dollars
and
cents
as
between
$7.59
cents
which
was
the
full
cost
--
fully
distributed
cost
of
the
railroads
and
$4.69
which
was
their
out-of-pocket
cost
of
handling
this
ingot
mold
traffic
and
this
is
apparently
the
position
of
the
railroads
that
within
their
discretion,
they
should
have
the
opportunity
to
file
any
rate
at
a
level
between
those
two
figures.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
it
infringes
the
inherent
advantage
clause
of
the
national
transportation
policy
because
it
deprives
if
the
railroads
are
permitted
to
file
rates
on
this
basis,
it
would
tend
to
deprive
the
barge
lines
of
an
inherent
cost
advantage.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
that's
debatable
but
apparently,
they're
making
money.
this
is
profitable
to
the
railroads.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
no,
they
make
money
in
this
sense.
if
they
filed
a
rate
at
their
full
cost
level
or
in
some
higher
figure
than
$5.11
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
actually
in
the
sense
that
it
includes
depreciation
and
includes
many
--
it
includes
the
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
your
honor,
they
make
money
only
in
this
sense
that
they
--
when
they
obtain
the
traffic,
they
are
able
to
make
some
contribution
to
their
constant
cost
which
without
the
traffic,
they
would
not
make
any
contribution
too.
this
constant
cost
go
on
whether
or
not
they
handle
this
traffic
and
when
they
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
the
full
cost
of
the
barge
lines
is
about
$5.19.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
on
of
the
main
differences
is
that
the
barge
lines
do
not
have
a
right
of
way
cost.
they
do
not
pay
user
charges.
they
don't
have
to
pay
for
the
use
of
the
waterways.
that's
a
very
real
difference
between
the
two
modes
of
transportation
and
we
believe
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes,
yes,
this
is
precisely
what
senator
wheeler
said
during
the
legislative
history
of
the
transportation
act.
this
wasn't
inherent
cost
advantage.
this
was
a
natural
advantage
to
the
water
carriers.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
we
don't.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
no.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
we
made
that
initial
comparison
of
that
$7.00
and
something
to
$7.59
with
the
$5.19
of
the
barge
lines
and
made
a
determination
that
on
the
basis
of
that
comparison,
the
barge
lines
were
the
low
cost
mode.
they
possess
that
the
inherent--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
that
is
the
commission's
holding
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
that's
true.
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that's
precisely
the
issue
because
the
railroads
are
not
so
much
concerned
with
determining
inherent
advantages
and
with
comparing
costs.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes,
this
is
our
position.
this
is
our
position
that
you
must
make
a
comparison
and
you
must
make
this
determination.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes
it
might.
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
it's
the
purpose
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
mr.
justice
black,
we
suggested
on
brief
a
matter
which
was
not
within
the
commission's
report,
a
competition
of
counsel
solely
that
the
same
result
might
have
been
reached
on
this
record
if
the
commission
had
taken
the
out-of-pocket
cost
of
the
railroads
and
it's
simply
added
to
that,
the
constant
right
of
way
cost
of
the
railroads
so
as
to
prevent
the
railroads
from
undermining
from
taking
away
the
inherent
advantage
of
the
barge
lines
and
not
having
this
cost.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
this
is
a
standard
that
the
commission
has
employed
and
is
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
we
have
not
tried
to
and
i
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
we
have
not
tried
to
and
i
think
i
must
agree
with
you
to
do
any
other
formula
would
be
artificial.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
council
of
economic
advisers
did
suggest
that
the
most
efficient
use
of
society's
resources
would
be
made
under
an
out-of-pocket
standard
but
it
was
never
explained
on
this
record
shifting
the
traffic
away
from
an
existing
barge
service
to
an
existing
railroad
service
made
more
efficient
use
of
society's
resources.
both
services
were
in
existence,
both
services
should
be
used.
thank
you.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
the
pennsylvania
railroad,
now
the
penn
central
transportation
company
and
other
railroads
sought
to
cut
their
rate
on
ingot
molds
which
are
iron
forms
in
which
molten
steel
is
cast
from
$11.86
per
ton
to
$5.11
per
ton
to
capture
traffic
that
had
moved
for
a
decade
by
combination
barge
and
truck
service.
the
commission
found
that
the
new
railroad
rate
would
impair
an
inherent
cost
advantage
of
the
barge-truck
mode
of
transportation.
the
commission
ordered
the
railroads
to
cancel
the
offending
rate.
the
district
court
of
three
judges
reversed
the
commission's
decision
and
the
commission
is
here
today
on
direct
appeal.
this
is
the
first
rate
case
to
reach
the
courts
involving
the
standards
governing
the
fair
competition
between
regulated
carriers
of
different
modes
of
transportation
since
this
court's
decision
in
the
new
haven
case.
interstate
commerce
commission
versus
new
york,
new
haven
and
hartford
decided
in
1963
reported
in
372
of
the
united
states
reports.
the
new
haven
case
was
the
first
in
which
this
court
addressed
itself
to
the
role
of
the
commission
in
overseeing
rate
competition
among
different
modes
of
transportation
following
the
1958
amendments
to
the
interstate
commerce
act.
like
the
new
haven
case,
the
present
case
involves
the
meaning
of
the
1958
amendment
to
section
15
(a)
(3)
of
the
act.
the
amendment
added
this
language.
rates
of
a
carrier
shall
not
be
held
up
to
a
particular
level
to
protect
the
traffic
of
any
other
mode
of
transportation
giving
due
consideration
to
the
objectives
of
the
national
transportation
policy
declared
in
this
act.
and
the
particular
objective
of
the
transportation
policy
that
is
here
in
issue
again
like
new
haven
is
the
recognition
and
preservation
of
inherent
cost
advantages
as
between
competing
modes
of
transportation.
when
the
present
case
was
before
the
commission,
the
railroads
and
the
barge
lines
followed
strictly
the
format
described
in
the
new
haven
case
for
presenting
the
issue
of
which
mode
possesses
an
inherent
cost
advantage.
the
railroads
first
showed
that
their
newly
reduced
rate
of
$5.11
would
more
than
cover
their
long-term
out
of
pocket
costs
of
$4.69
and
hence
the
reduced
rate
was
just
unreasonable
from
the
standpoint
of
railroad
revenue
requirements.
they
then
showed
their
full
cost
of
carrying
this
traffic
to
be
$7.59
that
is
the
out
of
pocket
cost
of
$4.69
plus
a
share
of
the
constant
expenses
of
running
the
railroad.
the
barge-truck
mode
then
claimed
an
inherent
cost
advantage
and
brought
forth
data
relating
to
its
own
cost.
the
barge-truck
mode
showed
that
the
railroads
were
reducing
their
rate
below
the
barge-truck
full
cost
of
$5.19
and
they
are
on
a
full
cost
basis.
the
barge-truck
mode
possessed
an
inherent
cost
advantage.
the
railroads
countered
by
saying
that
no
cost
comparison
should
be
made.
they
then
said
that
if
one
is
to
be
made,
the
costs
on
the
barge
side
should
include
the
governmental
cost
of
improving
the
water
rights
of
way
or
the
commission
should
ignore
on
the
rail
side
of
the
equation,
all
rail
constant
costs.
the
commission
held
it
would
not
follow
either
of
the
railroads
suggestions.
determination
of
inherent
cost
advantage
requires
a
cost
comparison.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
citing
a
proceeding
in
which
it
had
given
more
detailed
consideration
to
the
question
of
what
costs
are
relevant
to
a
comparison
between
railroads
and
barge
lines,
the
commission
held
that
it
would
adhere
to
a
comparison
of
full
costs
of
the
two
competing
modes
and
down
the
basis
--
on
the
basis
of
such
a
comparison
here
the
rail
rate
impaired
the
barge
lines
low
cost
advantage
and
should
be
cancelled.
when
the
case
came
before
the
lower
court,
the
lower
court
held
agreeing
with
the
railroads
that
no
comparison
of
rates
was
necessary
or
proper
as
a
matter
of
law
since
the
railroad
rate
of
$5.11
more
than
covered
the
rail
out
of
pocket
costs
of
$4.69.
the
court
held
that
as
a
matter
or
law,
the
commission
was
powerless
to
order
the
railroad
rate
cancelled.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
there
was
no
comparable
out
of
pocket
figure
ascertained
on
this
record
for
the
barge
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
in
the
new
automobiles
case,
the
commission
had
a
footnote
to
the
effect
that
the
barge
full
cost
is
approximately
90%
variable
and
the
commission's
formula
with
respect
to
truck
costs
also
relies
upon
a
90%
factor.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
that
means
that
the
out
of
pocket
cost
are
roughly
90%
of
this
$5.19.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
much
higher.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
the
lower
court
cites
the
issue
of
what
costs
are
relevant
to
comparing
cost
of
different
modes
and
of
measuring
inherent
cost
advantages
of
different
modes.
the
opinion
below
contradicted
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
in
relying
upon
what
was
profitable
for
the
proponent
of
the
rate.
section
15
(a)
(3)
requires
the
commission
to
give
due
consideration
to
the
national
transportation
policy.
the
policy
in
turn
requires
the
commission
to
recognize
and
preserve
inherent
advantages
of
each
mode
subject
to
its
regulation.
besides
this
due
consideration
required
on
the
face
of
section
15
(a)
(3),
the
final
sentence
of
the
national
transportation
policy
itself
requires
the
commission
to
administer
the
entire
act
in
accordance
to
the
requirements
of
the
policy.
as
this
court
stated
in
the
schaffer
transportation
case
decided
in
1957,
the
policy
provides
a
yard
stick
by
which
the
correctness
of
the
commission's
action
will
be
measured.
the
commission
could
not
properly
end
its
inquiry
as
the
lower
court
required
us
to
do
with
the
finding
that
the
rate
would
benefit
the
railroads.
the
lower
court's
decision
that
the
commission
was
required
to
end
its
inquiry
with
the
finding
that
the
rate
would
benefit
the
railroads
was
contrary
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
new
haven
case.
this
court
specifically
stated
that
the
commission's
task
does
not
end
upon
finding
that
a
reduced
rate
will
benefit
the
proponent
of
the
rate.
as
this
court
stated
in
the
new
haven
case,
the
precise
example
given
to
the
senate
committee
which
led
to
the
language
adopted
in
1958
was
a
case
in
which
the
railroads
by
establishing
a
compensatory
rate
forced
a
smaller
competing
lower
cost
mode
to
go
below
its
own
fully
distributed
cost
and
thus
perhaps
to
go
out
of
business.
this
court
stated
that
the
principal
purpose
of
the
reference
to
the
national
transportation
policy
that
was
contained
in
section
15
(a)
(3)
was
to
emphasize
the
commission's
power
to
prevent
the
railroads
from
setting
a
rate
which
would
impair
or
destroy
the
inherent
advantages
of
competing
modes
of
transportation
and
the
precise
example
given
by
this
court
of
how
this
impairment
might
occur
in
the
normal
case
was
by
the
railroads
forcing
a
competing
mode
with
a
cost
advantage
on
particular
transportation
to
establish
a
non-profitable
rate
in
order
to
attract
traffic.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i'm
sorry.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
this
court
held
in
new
haven
mr.
justice
harlan
that
the
commission
must
weigh
the
effect
of
the
rail
rate
reduction
on
competing
carriers.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
if
the
précised
question
here
your
honor
is
in
terms
of
how
you
measure
an
inherent
advantage
of
what
group
of
cost
you
used
then
i
would
agree
with
you.
this
was
not
reached
in
new
haven
but
the
lower
court
has
created
a
rule
of
law
that
you
look
only
to
the
profitability
of
this
rate
to
the
proponent
of
the
rate.
now,
that
question
we
submit
was
reached
in
new
haven
and
this
court
held
in
new
haven
that
you
do
not
look
only
to
the
profitability
of
the
rate
to
the
proponent
but
the
commission
has
a
further
task.
now,
the
appellees
in
the
lower
court
rely
heavily
on
the
commission's
1945
decisions
in
the
new
automobiles
case.
of
course
this
court
in
new
haven
referred
to
new
automobiles
as
a
case
whose
result
was
particularly
favored
by
congress
in
1958
but
appellees
in
the
lower
court
received
no
comfort
to
the
new
automobiles
decision.
new
automobiles
was
cited
in
congress
only
for
the
proposition
that
rail
rates
should
not
be
held
up
merely
to
make
certain
that
all
modes
participate
in
the
traffic.
this
is
the
only
principle
of
new
automobiles
that
congress
endorsed
as
this
court
expressly
stated
in
new
haven.
the
new
automobiles
was
cited
by
congress
in
opposition
to
the
cases
in
which
the
commission
had
held
that
in
its
judgment,
certain
rail
reductions
were
lower
than
necessary
to
meet
competition
without
reference
to
inherent
cost
advantages.
and
congress
in
1958
sought
to
give
new
emphasis
to
protecting
these
advantages.
in
looking
only
to
the
costs
of
the
proponent
of
the
rate
to
decide
the
lawfulness
of
the
rate,
the
lower
court
gave
to
the
railroads
in
this
case
what
years
of
law
being
before
congress
had
failed
to
attain.
we
suggest
that
the
ruling
below
does
not
differ
from
two
of
the
so-called
three
shall
nots
which
congress
rejected
in
the
1950s
and
which
this
court
discussed
in
the
new
haven
case.
the
railroads
lobbied
for
years
that
the
commission
and
i
quote,
“shall
not
consider
the
effect
of
such
charge
on
the
traffic
of
any
other
mode
of
transportation
or
the
relation
of
such
charge
to
the
charge
of
any
other
mode
of
transportation.”
these
were
the
first
two
of
the
three
shall
nots.
these
shall
nots
died
in
committee
only
to
be
revived
in
the
ruling
of
the
lower
court.
the
lower
court
sought
to
remove
what
it
called
a
restriction
on
competition
with
its
ruling
and
to
free
the
railroads
to
operate
that
were
beneficial
to
themselves.
the
lower
court
improperly
assumed,
we
submit,
improperly
assumed
that
congress
legislated
in
1958
exclusively
to
further
competition
between
the
modes
of
transportation
and
to
remove
cost
comparisons
from
rate
proceedings.
we
submit
such
is
not
the
case
again
as
this
court
stated
in
new
haven.
the
principle
reason
for
the
reference
back
to
the
national
transportation
policy
in
section
15
(a)
(3)
was
to
emphasize
the
commission's
power
to
prevent
the
railroads
from
impairing
the
inherent
cost
advantages
of
competing
modes
of
transportation
by
rate
cutting.
in
the
new
haven
case,
the
department
of
justice
acknowledged
that
the
commission
must
compare
costs
and
protect
the
carrier
having
the
lower
fully
distributed
costs.
in
fact
so
strongly
did
the
department
believed
that
the
inherent
advantage
of
lower
full
costs
must
be
protected
from
impairment
that
it
would
have
imposed
the
differential
favoring
the
barge
lines
that
had
lower
full
costs.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
this
was
in
the
new
haven
case
in
the
brief
of
the
department
of
justice.
in
terms
of
the
present
facts,
the
department
then
would
have
prohibited
the
railroads
from
charging
anything
less
than
$7.51
on
ingot
molds.
in
contrast,
the
department
has
filed
a
brief
in
the
present
case
arguing
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
carrier
with
a
lower
full
cost
should
be
stripped
of
all
protection
and
the
railroads
may
file
any
rate
that
benefits
themselves
indeed
down
to
$4.69,
the
railroads
own
out
of
pocket
cost
level.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
the
principle
of
the
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
the
government
won
the
new
haven
case
to
the
extent
that
the
government
urged
that
the
commission
should
take
steps
to
protect
the
inherent
cost
advantages
of
the
mode
of
transportation
in
competition
with
the
railroad.
the
same
sort
of
steps
which
the
department
would
now
have
the
commission
abandoned.
strangely,
the
department's
brief
says
nothing
of
this
inconsistency
with
its
new
haven
position.
more
strangely
still
is
the
department's
current
position
contrary
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
new
haven
that
the
commission
has
no
power
either
to
recognize
an
inherent
cost
advantage
on
the
level
other
than
out
of
pocket
cost
or
to
stop
the
railroads
from
making
unduly
lower
rates
that
impair
another
mode's
cost
advantage.
the
department
in
fact
would
ignore
the
commission
has
been
rate
power.
it
would
turn
the
clock
back
about
50
years
when
the
commission
could
only
stop
the
railroads
from
again
increasing
an
unduly
low
rate.
consistent
with
the
prior
decisions,
the
commission
here
found
that
a
comparison
of
the
full
cost
of
each
mode
must
be
made
to
determine
which
mode
has
an
inherent
cost
advantage
and
that
it
would
exercise
its
minimum
rate
power
to
cancel
a
rate
that
impaired
such
an
advantage.
the
congress
have
the
request
of
the
commission
did
not
lay
down
any
test
of
inherent
cost
advantage
as
a
matter
of
law.
significantly,
the
only
time
that
congress
addressed
itself
to
the
question
was
to
consider
whether
full
costs
should
be
adopted
as
a
matter
of
law
for
every
case.
in
new
haven,
this
court
implied
that
a
full
cost
comparison
would
be
an
appropriate
measure
of
inherent
cost
advantages
but
it
stated
explicitly
that
the
choice
among
different
measures
was
one
of
utility
and
one
for
the
commission
to
make.
the
inherent
cost
advantage
that
congress
primarily
concerned
itself
with
was
no
secret
from
the
parties
to
this
case.
senator
wheeler
had
stated
in
1940
during
the
course
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
transportation
act
of
that
year.
when
the
--
and
this
i
quote,
“when
the
bill
speaks
of
inherent
advantages
of
the
shipping
interest,
it
refers
to
carriers
which
can
transport
at
a
cheaper
rate
because
they
can
ship
by
water
by
way
of
canals
and
the
ocean
so
they
have
natural
advantages
and
they
do
not
have
the
expense
of
the
upkeep
of
the
rights
of
way
as
railroads
do.
it
was
this
absence
of
right
of
way
costs
that
congress
specially
sought
to
preserve
as
a
recognized
cost
advantage
of
water
carriers
and
the
railroad
witnesses
in
the
present
case
also
recognize
the
barge
lines
cost
advantage
in
relation
to
the
railroads
only
to
urge
that
the
commission
should
permit
the
railroads
to
defeat
disadvantage.
in
their
view,
the
commission
should
either
ignore
rail
constant
costs
altogether
or
increase
barge
line
costs
by
the
amount
of
the
government
cost
of
improving
the
waterways
and
the
railroads
repeat
on
brief
in
this
court
that
only
some
of
their
right
of
way
costs
should
enter
into
the
comparison.
here,
the
commission
simply
incorporated
the
discussion
of
this
issue
contained
in
the
earlier
green
case.
commission
had
their
help
that
full
cost
has
actually
born
by
the
water
carriers
and
not
hypothetical
costs
should
be
used
to
compare
the
cost
of
railroads
and
water
carriers.
the
congressional
policy
has
been
to
exempt
inland
water
carriers
from
user
charges
and
hence
to
exempt
shippers
by
water
from
paying
for
the
waterways.
the
commission
therefore
refused
to
compare
cost
of
operation
as
if
the
water
carriers
did
in
fact
pay
user
charges.
it
simply
recognized
and
preserved
the
existing
cost
advantage
of
the
water
carriers
and
consistent
with
its
ruling
in
the
green
case.
the
commission
here
both
refused
to
increase
the
water
carrier
cost
by
any
part
of
the
government's
cost
of
building,
improving
or
maintaining
the
inland
waterways
and
refused
to
decrease
the
railroads
cost
to
remove
any
part
of
the
railroad
right
of
way
cost.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
no.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
mr.
justice
white,
the
commission
was
not
asked
to
set
a
differential
in
this
case.
the
whole
question
of
service
advantages
was
out
of
the
case.
in
fact,
in
this
decision
and
on
this
record,
the
railroads
are
left
free
to
assert
whatever
service
advantages
they
have.
the
commission's
decision
just
doesn't
reach
your
question.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
it
was
not
raised
as
an
issue
by
any
party.
we
were
not
asked
to
establish
differentials.
we
were
not
asked
to
prescribe
a
railroad
rate.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
not
in
the
present
opinion.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
fully
distributive
cost
of
$7.59.
the
present
opinion
merely
orders
the
railroads
to
cancel
a
rate
of
$5.11.
that's
the
full
scope
of
the
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
depriving
the
barge
lines
of
an
inherent
advantage
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
they
are
the
low
cost
carrier.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
the
full
distributive
cost
of
the
barge
lines,
here
being
$5.19.
if
the
court
please,
the
commission
in
its
report
and
in
its
brief
has
not
stated
that
fully
distributive
costs
are
the
only
measure
of
inherent
cost
advantage
nor
that
full
costs
are
the
only
way
to
protect
the
obvious
inherent
cost
advantages
of
the
barge
lines.
the
commission
in
its
report
refers
to
the
limited
record
before
it.
it
refers
to
the
railroad's
request
for
an
out
of
pocket
standard
that
would
amount
to
a
radical
departure
from
precedent
and
it
states
that
more
detailed
consideration
will
be
given
to
the
entire
question
in
a
broad
rule
making
proceeding
that
is
in
fact
still
pending
before
the
agency.
and
the
commission
in
its
brief
also
shows
that
a
full
cost
comparison
was
not
even
necessary
to
the
result
reached
by
the
commission
that
the
railroads
here
are
the
high
cost
mode
of
transportation
even
if
we
set
to
one
side
the
entire
group
of
railroad
constant
costs
and
draw
from
that
group
only
the
constant
right
of
way
costs
and
add
those
constant
right
of
way
costs
to
the
out
of
pocket
costs
of
the
railroads
even
in
that
sort
of
comparison,
the
railroads
are
the
high
cost
mode
of
transportation.
what
we
do
emphatically
urge
is
this.
first,
that
the
commission's
task
in
overseeing
the
competition
between
railroads
and
other
modes
of
transportation
does
not
end
when
the
commission
has
found
that
a
particular
railroad
rate
is
beneficial
to
the
proponent
railroads.
secondly,
the
commission
must
compare
the
costs
of
competing
carriers
in
order
to
recognize
cost
advantages.
third,
the
task
of
recognizing
and
preserving
inherent
cost
advantages
is
an
administrative
task,
not
a
judicial
task.
and
finally
that
on
this
limited
record,
the
commission
exercised
a
rational
choice
of
full
costs
rather
than
out
of
pocket
cost
in
making
this
comparison
of
costs
and
rationally
held
that
the
rail
rate
reduction
below
the
barge-truck
full
cost
level
unlawfully
impair
the
low
cost
advantage
enjoyed
by
the
barge-truck
mode.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
this
case
involves
in
a
question
of
service
advantages.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
oh,
no.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
by
no
means,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
they're
not
out.
they're
not
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
true.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
the
other
elements
are
as
you
have
stated
mr.
justice
fortas
listed
in
the
national
transportation
policy
and
in
section
15
(a)
(3)
but
they
were
not
--
they're
not
involved
in
this
case.
this
is
a
very
narrow
case
involving
the
protection
of
the
carrier
cost
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
there
is
some
--
i
think
that's
accurate.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i
say
that
no
other
statutory
standards
are
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
section
15
(1)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
which
involves
a
--
the
commission's
power
to
prescribe,
to
determine
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
is
involved
and
that
we
are
not
limited
to
a
section
4
sort
of
power
in
which
we
can
only
limit
a
railroad
after
the
fact
and
not
permit
the
railroad
to
increase
a
rate.
in
other
words,
under
section
15,
we
can't
--
we
do
have
power
over
--
we
have
a
minimum
rate
power.
mr.

recognize

it's

of
the
government's
brief.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
page
3.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes,
it
does
in
certain
cases.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
this
case
does
not
involve
the
rendition
of
a
particular
service.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
oh!
no.
i
understand
your
question
and
i'm
sorry.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
now,
there
are
findings
in
this
report
and
the
commission
has
stated
that
the
rail
rate
would,
in
addition
to
impairing
a
cost
advantage
of
the
barge
lines,
also
lead
to
a
destruction
of
the
barge
lines
that
in
that
sense,
it
is
a
--
it
is
destructive
of
the
barge
service.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
the
cost
factor
also
determines
the
type
of
consideration
that
the
commission
gave
to
the
destructiveness
of
the
competition
here.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
in
the
guise
of
asking
more
findings
from
the
commission,
the
department
and
the
appellees
generally
would
impose
a
rule
of
law
on
the
commission.
in
their
view,
the
commission
must
permit
the
railroads
to
decrease
their
rates
within
this
margin
between
full
cost
and
out-of-pocket
cost
in
the
discretion
of
the
railroads.
the
counsel
for
the
railroads
has
stated
to
this
court,
the
commission
had
no
concern
with
the
effect
on
the
barge
lines.
now,
i
wish
to
emphasize
very
strongly
that
affirming
the
lower
court's
decision
means
that
this
court
affirms
that
rule
of
law
and
our
reason
for
appeal
was
to
overturn
that
rule
of
law.
now,
the
appellees
urge
that
this
particular
rate
that
was
before
the
commission
would
not
seriously
affect
the
barge
lines
while
the
commission's
judgment
differed.
its
judgment
differed
with
respect
both
to
the
effectiveness
rate
on
the
barge
lines
and
with
respect
to
the
effect
of
this
practice,
this
measure
of
inherent
advantage
that
the
railroads
espoused
the
effect
of
this
practice
on
the
barge
lines.
further,
the
commission's
findings
in
this
case
are
indeed
sufficient
to
support
the
commission's
full
cost
standard.
now,
i
believe
the
counsel
for
the
department
inadvertently
state
to
this
court
that
the
commission
had
not
even
considered
service
advantages.
if
the
court
please,
at
pages
40
and
43
of
the
record,
there
are
findings
there
concerning
the
service
advantages
and
findings
to
the
effect
that
service
advantages
are
not
determinative
of
the
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
your
honor
in
this
case,
it
was
a
difference
in
dollars
and
cents
as
between
$7.59
cents
which
was
the
full
cost
--
fully
distributed
cost
of
the
railroads
and
$4.69
which
was
their
out-of-pocket
cost
of
handling
this
ingot
mold
traffic
and
this
is
apparently
the
position
of
the
railroads
that
within
their
discretion,
they
should
have
the
opportunity
to
file
any
rate
at
a
level
between
those
two
figures.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
it
infringes
the
inherent
advantage
clause
of
the
national
transportation
policy
because
it
deprives
if
the
railroads
are
permitted
to
file
rates
on
this
basis,
it
would
tend
to
deprive
the
barge
lines
of
an
inherent
cost
advantage.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
that's
debatable
but
apparently,
they're
making
money.
this
is
profitable
to
the
railroads.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
no,
they
make
money
in
this
sense.
if
they
filed
a
rate
at
their
full
cost
level
or
in
some
higher
figure
than
$5.11
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
actually
in
the
sense
that
it
includes
depreciation
and
includes
many
--
it
includes
the
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
your
honor,
they
make
money
only
in
this
sense
that
they
--
when
they
obtain
the
traffic,
they
are
able
to
make
some
contribution
to
their
constant
cost
which
without
the
traffic,
they
would
not
make
any
contribution
too.
this
constant
cost
go
on
whether
or
not
they
handle
this
traffic
and
when
they
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
the
full
cost
of
the
barge
lines
is
about
$5.19.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
on
of
the
main
differences
is
that
the
barge
lines
do
not
have
a
right
of
way
cost.
they
do
not
pay
user
charges.
they
don't
have
to
pay
for
the
use
of
the
waterways.
that's
a
very
real
difference
between
the
two
modes
of
transportation
and
we
believe
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes,
yes,
this
is
precisely
what
senator
wheeler
said
during
the
legislative
history
of
the
transportation
act.
this
wasn't
inherent
cost
advantage.
this
was
a
natural
advantage
to
the
water
carriers.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
we
don't.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
no.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
we
made
that
initial
comparison
of
that
$7.00
and
something
to
$7.59
with
the
$5.19
of
the
barge
lines
and
made
a
determination
that
on
the
basis
of
that
comparison,
the
barge
lines
were
the
low
cost
mode.
they
possess
that
the
inherent--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
that
is
the
commission's
holding
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
that's
true.
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that's
precisely
the
issue
because
the
railroads
are
not
so
much
concerned
with
determining
inherent
advantages
and
with
comparing
costs.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes,
this
is
our
position.
this
is
our
position
that
you
must
make
a
comparison
and
you
must
make
this
determination.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes
it
might.
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
it's
the
purpose
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
mr.
justice
black,
we
suggested
on
brief
a
matter
which
was
not
within
the
commission's
report,
a
competition
of
counsel
solely
that
the
same
result
might
have
been
reached
on
this
record
if
the
commission
had
taken
the
out-of-pocket
cost
of
the
railroads
and
it's
simply
added
to
that,
the
constant
right
of
way
cost
of
the
railroads
so
as
to
prevent
the
railroads
from
undermining
from
taking
away
the
inherent
advantage
of
the
barge
lines
and
not
having
this
cost.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
this
is
a
standard
that
the
commission
has
employed
and
is
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
yes.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
we
have
not
tried
to
and
i
--
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
we
have
not
tried
to
and
i
think
i
must
agree
with
you
to
do
any
other
formula
would
be
artificial.
mr.
leonard
s.
goodman
well,
council
of
economic
advisers
did
suggest
that
the
most
efficient
use
of
society's
resources
would
be
made
under
an
out-of-pocket
standard
but
it
was
never
explained
on
this
record
shifting
the
traffic
away
from
an
existing
barge
service
to
an
existing
railroad
service
made
more
efficient
use
of
society's
resources.
both
services
were
in
existence,
both
services
should
be
used.
thank
you.
