mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
in
797,
the
waterways
freight
bureau
and
the
regulated
barge
lines
party
to
the
case.
the
commission
in
this
proceeding
having
found
that
the
proposed
rail
rate
to
be
above
rail
out-of-pocket
cost
and
therefore
compensatory,
it
addressed
itself
to
the
real
issue
or
problem
in
this
case
that
of
its
power
under
section
15a(3)
of
the
act
to
the
determination
by
comparison
of
costs
which
mode,
rail
or
water,
possess
the
inherent
advantage
of
low
costs
and
whether
that
advantage,
if
it
lay
with
the
water
carriers,
would
be
impelled.
it
was
no
longer
the
simple
problem
of
whether
the
rail
rate
standing
in
issue
by
itself
was
profitable
rate
to
the
railroads.
this
must
be
borne
in
mind
in
consideration
of
the
method
and
approach
used
by
the
commission
in
reaching
its
determinations
of
who
is
the
low
cost
carrier.
this
is
an
effort
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
ascertain
which
mode
of
carriage
should
be
permitted
in
the
public
interest,
not
in
the
interest
of
the
proponent
mode
alone
to
continue
to
participate
in
the
transportation
in
question.
this
proceeding
is
an
outgrowth
of
the
long
line
of
cases
reaching
back
some
40
years
and
more
in
which
the
water
carriers
have
been
forced
to
fight
rail
rate
reductions
designed
to
pick
off
vital
tonnage.
the
precise
rate
in
question
in
this
ingot
molds
case
became
effective
march
19,
1965,
almost
immediately
following
the
decision
by
the
division
of
the
commission
which
was
issued
in
february
1965.
the
commission
found
that
this
tonnage,
ingot
molds
is
a
part
of
a
group
embracing
iron
and
steel
products
which
group
is
a
third
most
important
commodity
group
transported
in
barge
line
service.
it,
the
group,
represents
11%
of
the
barge
line
revenue.
it
is
one
of
only
11
groups
of
tonnage
which
account
for
81.45%
of
the
total
barge
revenue.
the
commission
fully
understood
in
fully
mandated
statements
that
the
traffic
is
of
more
consequence
to
the
barge
lines
than
to
the
railroads
and
it
was
dealing
with
a
railroad
concept
that
would
not
only
impair
the
ability
of
the
water
carriers
to
compete
but
to
actually
exist.
the
barge
lines
in
this
case
introduced
evidence
to
prove
and
did
prove
that
their
inherent
advantage
of
low
cost
would
be
impaired
by
this
rate
set
at
a
level
below
the
barge
line
fully
distributed
cost,
that
barge
lines
went
one
step
further
and
proved
that
their
inherent
advantage
could
be
destroyed
by
the
ability
in
the
railroads
to
take
such
a
step
with
respect
of
only
a
few
groups
of
commodities.
this
evidence
in
this
case
was
directed
to
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
new
haven
case
where
at
page
78,
it
was
said
the
principal
reason
for
the
reference
to
section
15a(3)
as
the
hearing
shown
was
to
emphasize
the
power
of
the
commission
to
prevent
the
railroad
from
destroying
or
impairing
the
inherent
advantages
of
other
modes
and
the
precise
example
given
to
the
senate
committee
which
led
to
the
language
adopted
was
a
case
in
which
the
railroads
by
establishing
on
a
part
of
their
operations
a
compensatory
rate
below
their
fully
distributed
cost
forced
a
smaller,
competing,
lower
cost
mode
to
go
below
its
own
fully
distributed
cost
and
thus
perhaps
to
go
out
of
business.
this
conclusion
was
reiterated
by
this
court
at
page
759
in
the
same
decision
where
it
was
discussing
unfair
or
destructive
competitive
practices.
so
the
test
before
the
commission
in
ingot
molds
was
not
solely
as
the
rail
proponents
would
have
us
believe
determined
whether
the
rate
was
profitable
to
the
railroads.
the
test
was
the
issue
of
intermodal
competition
under
section
15a(3).
first
the
division
and
secondly
the
commission
addressed
themselves
completely
to
this
problem.
vital
findings
of
fact
of
the
division
and
adopted
by
the
commission
were
first
that
the
proposed
rate
was
above
rail
out-of-pocket
cost
and
therefore
compensatory.
second,
that
the
barge's
fully
distributed
costs
were
below
such
cost
by
the
rails.
third,
that
the
proposed
rate
was
below
the
rail's
fully
distributed
cost
and
that
the
proposed
rate
was
below
the
barge's
fully
distributed
cost.
these
findings
--
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
the
actual
figure
of
revenue?
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
81%
of
their
revenue
would
come
from
the
11
groups
of
commodity
from
11
groups
of
--
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
no,
from
the
iron
and
steel
group,
approximately
11%.
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
they
have
to
--
have
to
recover
their
fully
distributed
costs
from
practically
everything
they
buy.
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
that's
right
sir.
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
the
group
of
commodities
to
which
ingot
molds
belong,
yes,
iron
and
steel
products,
roughly
11%
of
the
revenue
of
the
barge
lines.
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
yes,
they
have
to
get
it.
for
example,
from
other
ingot
mold
traffic
moving
out
of
the
same
plant
that
this
traffic
moves
out.
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
yes.
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
constant
cost
and
the
out-of-pocket
cost.
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
yes.
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
believe
that
in
this
case,
this
ingot
molds
case,
the
only
problem
before
the
commission
as
the
case
was
presented
to
the
commission
by
both
barge
lines
and
the
rails
was
this
question
of
the
inherent
cost
advantage.
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
no.
i
think
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
commission
and
i
think
the
commission
did
consider
what
the
effect
of
the
impairment
or
destruction
of
the
inherent
cost
advantage
would
be.
as
they
stated,
it
would
impair
their
ability
to
actually
exist.
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
15a(3),
that's
right.
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
consideration
must
be
given
to
the
national
transportation
policy.
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
well
yes,
i
think
the
commission
--
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
commission
took
that
into
account,
mr.
justice
fortas,
where
it
made
a
--
reached
a
conclusion
that
the
effect
of
this
rate
and
the
concept
advanced
by
the
railroads
would
be
to
not
only
affect
the
barge
line's
ability
to
compete
but
also
to
actually
exist.
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
that's

mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
now,
these
facts
in
this
ingot
molds
case
set
forth
precisely
the
problem
discussed
in
the
new
haven
case
an
attempt
by
the
high
cost
carrier
by
going
below
its
fully
distributed
cost
to
force
the
low
cost
carrier
to
go
below
its
fully
distributed
cost
to
compete.
now,
at
the
time
that
the
ingot
molds
case
was
being
tried
before
the
commission
and
at
the
time
that
the
new
haven
case
was
still
before
the
courts,
the
commission
had
before
the
case
involving
the
movement
of
grain
and
in
that
case,
the
commission
referring
to
the
new
haven
case
in
the
pendency
of
the
issues
pointed
out
that
it
was
--
its
--
part
of
its
duty
in
the
grain
case
to
consider
which
method
of
cost
would
be
used
in
determining
this
question
of
an
inherent
cost
advantage
and
it
addressed
itself
directly
to
the
problem.
and
in
the
grain
case,
it
came
up
with
the
general
rule
that
when
regulated
carriers
were
involved
in
an
intermodal
competitive
situation
such
as
we
have
in
the
grain
case,
the
commission
would
use
fully
distributed
cost
for
the
purpose
of
measuring
the
inherent
cost
advantage.
now,
in
the
ingot
molds
case,
both
the
division
and
the
full
commission
made
referenced
to
the
grain
case
and
to
the
general
rule
in
the
grain
case
and
used
that
rule
as
the
rational
basis
for
arriving
at
their
conclusion
in
this
case,
the
ingot
molds
case,
that
the
measure
of
inherent
cost
advantage
would
be
based
upon
fully
distributed
cost
of
both
carriers.
the
commission
refused
the
rail
carrier's
request
in
the
grain
case
to
adjust
upward
the
water
carrier
cost
by
adding
public
cost.
just
as
in
the
ingot
molds
case,
it
refused
to
adjust
downward
the
rail
cost
by
ignoring
constant
cost.
either
action
would
have
in
effect
eliminated
or
ignored
the
water
carrier's
inherent
advantage
of
low
cost.
the
commission
having
established
the
rule
in
the
grain
case
was
perfectly
within
its
right
and
it
was
its
duty
to
follow
that
rule
in
this
case
because
the
rail
carriers
presented
no
reason
for
a
departure
from
the
general
rule.
the
rail
carriers
contended
in
this
case
that
in
determining
the
low
cost
mode,
no
comparison
should
be
made.
the
commission
should
simply
determine
if
the
railroad
was
enhancing
its
profit
by
charging
a
rate
in
excess
of
out-of-pocket
cost.
the
commission
rejected
this
approach
citing
the
new
haven
case
and
this
court's
admonition
that
it
must
decide
how
to
measure
the
cost
advantage.
the
commission
reasoned
that
it
could
not
compare
by
considering
only
the
cost
of
the
rail
mode.
we
find
that
the
much
discussed
testimony
of
the
four
economists
speaking
for
the
railroads
were
summarized
by
the
division
as
follows,
that
out-of-pocket
costs
rather
than
fully
distributed
costs
should
be
the
only
basis
for
a
pricing
floor,
that
determination
of
the
most
economic
form
of
transportation
should
be
out-of-pocket
cost
and
that
there
can
be
no
meaningful
comparison
of
full
costs
of
rail
versus
water.
the
full
commission
adopted
this
summary.
the
commission
did
not
ignore
this
testimony
as
suggested
by
the
lower
court
but
it
did
reject
the
proposals.
based
upon
the
decision
in
the
grain
case
and
in
the
line
of
quoted
decision,
it
rejected
the
out-of-pocket
cost
as
a
measure
of
comparison.
it
is
plain
that
while
using
out-of-pocket
cost
as
a
pricing
floor
may
be
proper
when
only
the
one
mode
of
railroad
is
considered,
the
commission
rejected
and
with
reason
the
proposal
that
only
the
rail
rate
and
cost
should
be
considered
in
the
case
under
section
15a(3).
it
was
never
made
clear
by
the
economists
just
what
was
meant
by
the
contention
that
out-of-pocket
costs
were
best
used
in
the
determination
of
the
most
economic
form
of
transportation
or
just
how
this
would
be
a
determinative
if
only
one
form
of
transportation
was
to
be
considered.
it
was
not
necessary
that
the
commission
set
forth
in
detail
all
of
its
reasons
for
rejecting
this
testimony
as
determinative
of
the
issues
as
in
bno
versus
u.s.
--
239
u.s.
349.
the
court
--
this
court
held
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
commission
specify
the
weight
given
to
any
item
of
evidence
or
fact
or
disclose
mental
operations
by
which
its
decisions
are
reached.
the
lower
court
in
questioning
the
commission's
use
of
out-of-pocket
cost
to
determine
the
price
floor
in
the
grain
case
mistakenly
assumed
that
the
commission
was
considering
inherent
advantage
of
low
cost
in
the
same
context
as
in
this
case.
it
was
not.
there
was
no
comparison
made
in
that
case
of
the
cost
of
unregulated
carriers
with
those
of
the
rails.
section
15a(3)
applies
to
different
modes
of
transportation
subject
to
the
regulations
under
the
act.
faced
with
the
fact
that
traffic
moved
primarily
in
unregulated
transportation,
the
commission
saw
its
task
is
different
than
any
controversy
such
as
in
ingot
molds.
in
this
ingot
molds
decision,
the
commission
discussed
the
division
report,
adopted
the
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
consistent
with
its
decision,
fully
discussed
the
contentions
of
the
parties
made
in
their
petition
for
reconsideration,
incorporated
by
reference
its
discussion
in
the
grain
case
including
the
complete
discussion
of
fully
distributed
versus
out-of-pocket
cost
as
a
measure
of
cost
advantage,
pointed
out
that
the
precise
example
given
to
the
congress
as
a
reason
for
the
language
in
section
15a(3)
is
precisely
the
situation
under
discussion,
discussed
the
importance
of
the
traffic
to
the
water
carriers,
concluded
as
did
the
division
that
barge-truck
method
on
a
fully
distributed
basis
was
the
low
cost
mode,
that
the
rail
rate
below
the
barge's
fully
distributed
cost
impends
upon
the
ability
of
the
barge-truck
mode
to
completely
assert
its
inherent
cost
advantage.
in
conclusion,
may
i
say
that
contrary
to
the
lower
court's
opinion,
this
is
a
normal
situation
involving
intermodal
competition
between
water
and
rail
carriers,
a
situation
contemplated
in
section
15a(3),
a
situation
in
which
the
commission
is
directed
by
the
statute
and
by
this
court
in
new
haven
to
determine
the
low
cost
mode
of
transportation.
in
this
normal
situation,
the
commission
has
rejected
the
rail's
suggestion
or
proposal
that
it
consider
only
rail
out-of-pocket
cost.
it
would
not
decide
the
issue
in
that
factor.
instead,
the
commission
has
adopted
what
it
has
described
as
its
general
rule
to
use
fully
distributed
cost
as
a
measure
in
determining
the
low
cost
agency.
thank
you.
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
in
797,
the
waterways
freight
bureau
and
the
regulated
barge
lines
party
to
the
case.
the
commission
in
this
proceeding
having
found
that
the
proposed
rail
rate
to
be
above
rail
out-of-pocket
cost
and
therefore
compensatory,
it
addressed
itself
to
the
real
issue
or
problem
in
this
case
that
of
its
power
under
section
15a(3)
of
the
act
to
the
determination
by
comparison
of
costs
which
mode,
rail
or
water,
possess
the
inherent
advantage
of
low
costs
and
whether
that
advantage,
if
it
lay
with
the
water
carriers,
would
be
impelled.
it
was
no
longer
the
simple
problem
of
whether
the
rail
rate
standing
in
issue
by
itself
was
profitable
rate
to
the
railroads.
this
must
be
borne
in
mind
in
consideration
of
the
method
and
approach
used
by
the
commission
in
reaching
its
determinations
of
who
is
the
low
cost
carrier.
this
is
an
effort
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
ascertain
which
mode
of
carriage
should
be
permitted
in
the
public
interest,
not
in
the
interest
of
the
proponent
mode
alone
to
continue
to
participate
in
the
transportation
in
question.
this
proceeding
is
an
outgrowth
of
the
long
line
of
cases
reaching
back
some
40
years
and
more
in
which
the
water
carriers
have
been
forced
to
fight
rail
rate
reductions
designed
to
pick
off
vital
tonnage.
the
precise
rate
in
question
in
this
ingot
molds
case
became
effective
march
19,
1965,
almost
immediately
following
the
decision
by
the
division
of
the
commission
which
was
issued
in
february
1965.
the
commission
found
that
this
tonnage,
ingot
molds
is
a
part
of
a
group
embracing
iron
and
steel
products
which
group
is
a
third
most
important
commodity
group
transported
in
barge
line
service.
it,
the
group,
represents
11%
of
the
barge
line
revenue.
it
is
one
of
only
11
groups
of
tonnage
which
account
for
81.45%
of
the
total
barge
revenue.
the
commission
fully
understood
in
fully
mandated
statements
that
the
traffic
is
of
more
consequence
to
the
barge
lines
than
to
the
railroads
and
it
was
dealing
with
a
railroad
concept
that
would
not
only
impair
the
ability
of
the
water
carriers
to
compete
but
to
actually
exist.
the
barge
lines
in
this
case
introduced
evidence
to
prove
and
did
prove
that
their
inherent
advantage
of
low
cost
would
be
impaired
by
this
rate
set
at
a
level
below
the
barge
line
fully
distributed
cost,
that
barge
lines
went
one
step
further
and
proved
that
their
inherent
advantage
could
be
destroyed
by
the
ability
in
the
railroads
to
take
such
a
step
with
respect
of
only
a
few
groups
of
commodities.
this
evidence
in
this
case
was
directed
to
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
new
haven
case
where
at
page
78,
it
was
said
the
principal
reason
for
the
reference
to
section
15a(3)
as
the
hearing
shown
was
to
emphasize
the
power
of
the
commission
to
prevent
the
railroad
from
destroying
or
impairing
the
inherent
advantages
of
other
modes
and
the
precise
example
given
to
the
senate
committee
which
led
to
the
language
adopted
was
a
case
in
which
the
railroads
by
establishing
on
a
part
of
their
operations
a
compensatory
rate
below
their
fully
distributed
cost
forced
a
smaller,
competing,
lower
cost
mode
to
go
below
its
own
fully
distributed
cost
and
thus
perhaps
to
go
out
of
business.
this
conclusion
was
reiterated
by
this
court
at
page
759
in
the
same
decision
where
it
was
discussing
unfair
or
destructive
competitive
practices.
so
the
test
before
the
commission
in
ingot
molds
was
not
solely
as
the
rail
proponents
would
have
us
believe
determined
whether
the
rate
was
profitable
to
the
railroads.
the
test
was
the
issue
of
intermodal
competition
under
section
15a(3).
first
the
division
and
secondly
the
commission
addressed
themselves
completely
to
this
problem.
vital
findings
of
fact
of
the
division
and
adopted
by
the
commission
were
first
that
the
proposed
rate
was
above
rail
out-of-pocket
cost
and
therefore
compensatory.
second,
that
the
barge's
fully
distributed
costs
were
below
such
cost
by
the
rails.
third,
that
the
proposed
rate
was
below
the
rail's
fully
distributed
cost
and
that
the
proposed
rate
was
below
the
barge's
fully
distributed
cost.
these
findings
--
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
the
actual
figure
of
revenue?
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
81%
of
their
revenue
would
come
from
the
11
groups
of
commodity
from
11
groups
of
--
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
no,
from
the
iron
and
steel
group,
approximately
11%.
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
they
have
to
--
have
to
recover
their
fully
distributed
costs
from
practically
everything
they
buy.
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
that's
right
sir.
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
the
group
of
commodities
to
which
ingot
molds
belong,
yes,
iron
and
steel
products,
roughly
11%
of
the
revenue
of
the
barge
lines.
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
yes,
they
have
to
get
it.
for
example,
from
other
ingot
mold
traffic
moving
out
of
the
same
plant
that
this
traffic
moves
out.
mr.
harry
c.
ames,

yes.
mr.
harry

constant
cost
and
the
out-of-pocket
cost.
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
yes.
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
believe
that
in
this
case,
this
ingot
molds
case,
the
only
problem
before
the
commission
as
the
case
was
presented
to
the
commission
by
both
barge
lines
and
the
rails
was
this
question
of
the
inherent
cost
advantage.
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
no.
i
think
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
commission
and
i
think
the
commission
did
consider
what
the
effect
of
the
impairment
or
destruction
of
the
inherent
cost
advantage
would
be.
as
they
stated,
it
would
impair
their
ability
to
actually
exist.
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
15a(3),
that's
right.
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
consideration
must
be
given
to
the
national
transportation
policy.
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
well
yes,
i
think
the
commission
--
mr.
harry
c.
ames,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
commission
took
that
into
account,
mr.
justice
fortas,
where
it
made
a
--
reached
a
conclusion
that
the
effect
of
this
rate
and
the
concept
advanced
by
the
railroads
would
be
to
not
only
affect
the
barge
line's
ability
to
compete
but
also
to
actually
exist.
mr.
harry
c.

now,
these
facts
in
this
ingot
molds
case
set
forth
precisely
the
problem
discussed
in
the
new
haven
case
an
attempt
by
the
high
cost
carrier
by
going
below
its
fully
distributed
cost
to
force
the
low
cost
carrier
to
go
below
its
fully
distributed
cost
to
compete.
now,
at
the
time
that
the
ingot
molds
case
was
being
tried
before
the
commission
and
at
the
time
that
the
new
haven
case
was
still
before
the
courts,
the
commission
had
before
the
case
involving
the
movement
of
grain
and
in
that
case,
the
commission
referring
to
the
new
haven
case
in
the
pendency
of
the
issues
pointed
out
that
it
was
--
its
--
part
of
its
duty
in
the
grain
case
to
consider
which
method
of
cost
would
be
used
in
determining
this
question
of
an
inherent
cost
advantage
and
it
addressed
itself
directly
to
the
problem.
and
in
the
grain
case,
it
came
up
with
the
general
rule
that
when
regulated
carriers
were
involved
in
an
intermodal
competitive
situation
such
as
we
have
in
the
grain
case,
the
commission
would
use
fully
distributed
cost
for
the
purpose
of
measuring
the
inherent
cost
advantage.
now,
in
the
ingot
molds
case,
both
the
division
and
the
full
commission
made
referenced
to
the
grain
case
and
to
the
general
rule
in
the
grain
case
and
used
that
rule
as
the
rational
basis
for
arriving
at
their
conclusion
in
this
case,
the
ingot
molds
case,
that
the
measure
of
inherent
cost
advantage
would
be
based
upon
fully
distributed
cost
of
both
carriers.
the
commission
refused
the
rail
carrier's
request
in
the
grain
case
to
adjust
upward
the
water
carrier
cost
by
adding
public
cost.
just
as
in
the
ingot
molds
case,
it
refused
to
adjust
downward
the
rail
cost
by
ignoring
constant
cost.
either
action
would
have
in
effect
eliminated
or
ignored
the
water
carrier's
inherent
advantage
of
low
cost.
the
commission
having
established
the
rule
in
the
grain
case
was
perfectly
within
its
right
and
it
was
its
duty
to
follow
that
rule
in
this
case
because
the
rail
carriers
presented
no
reason
for
a
departure
from
the
general
rule.
the
rail
carriers
contended
in
this
case
that
in
determining
the
low
cost
mode,
no
comparison
should
be
made.
the
commission
should
simply
determine
if
the
railroad
was
enhancing
its
profit
by
charging
a
rate
in
excess
of
out-of-pocket
cost.
the
commission
rejected
this
approach
citing
the
new
haven
case
and
this
court's
admonition
that
it
must
decide
how
to
measure
the
cost
advantage.
the
commission
reasoned
that
it
could
not
compare
by
considering
only
the
cost
of
the
rail
mode.
we
find
that
the
much
discussed
testimony
of
the
four
economists
speaking
for
the
railroads
were
summarized
by
the
division
as
follows,
that
out-of-pocket
costs
rather
than
fully
distributed
costs
should
be
the
only
basis
for
a
pricing
floor,
that
determination
of
the
most
economic
form
of
transportation
should
be
out-of-pocket
cost
and
that
there
can
be
no
meaningful
comparison
of
full
costs
of
rail
versus
water.
the
full
commission
adopted
this
summary.
the
commission
did
not
ignore
this
testimony
as
suggested
by
the
lower
court
but
it
did
reject
the
proposals.
based
upon
the
decision
in
the
grain
case
and
in
the
line
of
quoted
decision,
it
rejected
the
out-of-pocket
cost
as
a
measure
of
comparison.
it
is
plain
that
while
using
out-of-pocket
cost
as
a
pricing
floor
may
be
proper
when
only
the
one
mode
of
railroad
is
considered,
the
commission
rejected
and
with
reason
the
proposal
that
only
the
rail
rate
and
cost
should
be
considered
in
the
case
under
section
15a(3).
it
was
never
made
clear
by
the
economists
just
what
was
meant
by
the
contention
that
out-of-pocket
costs
were
best
used
in
the
determination
of
the
most
economic
form
of
transportation
or
just
how
this
would
be
a
determinative
if
only
one
form
of
transportation
was
to
be
considered.
it
was
not
necessary
that
the
commission
set
forth
in
detail
all
of
its
reasons
for
rejecting
this
testimony
as
determinative
of
the
issues
as
in
bno
versus
u.s.
--
239
u.s.
349.
the
court
--
this
court
held
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
commission
specify
the
weight
given
to
any
item
of
evidence
or
fact
or
disclose
mental
operations
by
which
its
decisions
are
reached.
the
lower
court
in
questioning
the
commission's
use
of
out-of-pocket
cost
to
determine
the
price
floor
in
the
grain
case
mistakenly
assumed
that
the
commission
was
considering
inherent
advantage
of
low
cost
in
the
same
context
as
in
this
case.
it
was
not.
there
was
no
comparison
made
in
that
case
of
the
cost
of
unregulated
carriers
with
those
of
the
rails.
section
15a(3)
applies
to
different
modes
of
transportation
subject
to
the
regulations
under
the
act.
faced
with
the
fact
that
traffic
moved
primarily
in
unregulated
transportation,
the
commission
saw
its
task
is
different
than
any
controversy
such
as
in
ingot
molds.
in
this
ingot
molds
decision,
the
commission
discussed
the
division
report,
adopted
the
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
consistent
with
its
decision,
fully
discussed
the
contentions
of
the
parties
made
in
their
petition
for
reconsideration,
incorporated
by
reference
its
discussion
in
the
grain
case
including
the
complete
discussion
of
fully
distributed
versus
out-of-pocket
cost
as
a
measure
of
cost
advantage,
pointed
out
that
the
precise
example
given
to
the
congress
as
a
reason
for
the
language
in
section
15a(3)
is
precisely
the
situation
under
discussion,
discussed
the
importance
of
the
traffic
to
the
water
carriers,
concluded
as
did
the
division
that
barge-truck
method
on
a
fully
distributed
basis
was
the
low
cost
mode,
that
the
rail
rate
below
the
barge's
fully
distributed
cost
impends
upon
the
ability
of
the
barge-truck
mode
to
completely
assert
its
inherent
cost
advantage.
in
conclusion,
may
i
say
that
contrary
to
the
lower
court's
opinion,
this
is
a
normal
situation
involving
intermodal
competition
between
water
and
rail
carriers,
a
situation
contemplated
in
section
15a(3),
a
situation
in
which
the
commission
is
directed
by
the
statute
and
by
this
court
in
new
haven
to
determine
the
low
cost
mode
of
transportation.
in
this
normal
situation,
the
commission
has
rejected
the
rail's
suggestion
or
proposal
that
it
consider
only
rail
out-of-pocket
cost.
it
would
not
decide
the
issue
in
that
factor.
instead,
the
commission
has
adopted
what
it
has
described
as
its
general
rule
to
use
fully
distributed
cost
as
a
measure
in
determining
the
low
cost
agency.
thank
you.
