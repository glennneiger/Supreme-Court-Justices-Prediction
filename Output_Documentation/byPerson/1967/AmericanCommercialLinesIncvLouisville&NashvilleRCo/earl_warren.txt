mr.

chief
justice
earl

we'll
adjourn
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
continue
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friedman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
those
figures
--
the
two-thirds
though
would
be
changing
day
by
day,
would
they
not,
because
of
the
railroads
in
handling
their
passenger
traffic
on
the
grounds
that
they
--
they
don't
need
an
out-of-pocket
expense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
maybe
it
hasn't
substantially
changed
if
they
get
rid
of
all
of
their
passenger
traffic,
which
they're
rapidly
doing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
ask
you
--
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
if
they
don't
get
fully
distributed
expenses
in
this
situation,
cost
in
this
situation
where
they
have
competition,
do
not
rate
payers
have
to
make
that
up
where
there
is
no
competition?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friedman,
the
thing
that
i
don't
quite
understand
is
this.
as
i
understood
you
to
say,
you
couldn't
have
this
kind
of
rate
making
throughout
the
railroad
business
because
if
it
did,
they
corrode.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
couldn't
possibly
operate.
now,
doesn't
this
mean
that
if
they
can
find
this
to
type
or
the
standard
that
you
support,
only
in
competitive
situations
that
all
of
these
other
cause
will
have
to
be
loaded
on
to
the
people
where
there
is
no
competition?
and
if
so,
is
that
the
proper
rate
making?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
i
get
back
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question,
isn't
that
something
for
the
commission
to
determine?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
it
said
for
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
would
you
ask
us
to
vacate
this
case
and
send
it
back
for
further
findings
or
you
just
ask
us
to
reverse
it?
i
mean,
did
you
just
ask
us
to
affirm
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
helmetag.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
ask
you
this.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
emphasizing
as
you
say
this
--
the
small
amount
of
traffic,
are
you
suggesting
to
us
that
this
is
just
de
minimis
and
that
we
shouldn't
pay
any
attention
to
it
or
are
you
arguing
that
this
should
be
applied
to
all
intermodal
transportation
so
that
you
get
that
--
the
benefits
of
it
whether
it's
large
or
small?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
the
small
amount
here,
that's
the
amount
to
anything
as
far
as
the
argument
is
concerned.
