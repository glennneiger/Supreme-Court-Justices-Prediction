white
government

did
the

and
the
--
what
if
--
justice

white
i
think
--
on
this,
on
what
comes
with
the
one
involved
--
justice
byron

white
why
should
the
commission
--
if
it
was
going
to
say
that
the
limit
of
the
railroad's
ability
to
compete
on
these
rates
is
to
make
sure
that
the
low

carrier
of

by
your

wasn't
able
to
recover
their
fully
distributed

why
wouldn't
the
--
why
shouldn't
the
icc
have
just
set
a
differential
and
say
--
you
wouldn't
say
that
--
you
wouldn't
necessarily
concluded
the
railroads
couldn't
go
below
their
fully
distributed

justice
byron

white
this
is
so
you
couldn't
deprive
the
barges
of
their
fully
distributed
cost.
justice
byron

white
so
that
would
mean
that
if
matching
the

took
all
the
freight,
there
should
be
a
differential.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
anything
in
the
commission's
opinion
that
would
include
the
railroads
from
setting
a
rate
of
$6.00?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
that
they're
prevented
from
going
below
$7.00
or
whatever
their
fully
distributive
costs
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
that's
depriving
--
justice
byron
r.
white
because
they
are
the
low
cost
carrier.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
measured
by
fully

cost.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
also
means
that
the

has
to
recover
its
full
cost
some
place
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me,
does
the
--
does
the
record
indicates
how
much
of
the

revenue
comes
from
these
particular
items
that
are
in
--
justice

white
well,
what
percentage?
justice
byron

white
that
are
involved
here?
justice
byron

white
well,
i
take
it
that
the
barges,
like
the
railroads,
would
have
to
recover
their
fully
distributed
costs
from
somewhere.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
will
either
be
from
this
traffic
or
some
other
traffic.
justice
byron

white
and
this
is
--
this
is
the
--
the
commodities
that
are
involved
here,
about
10%
of
the
barge's
revenue
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
railroads
have
to
get
their
costs
from
some
place,
i
suppose,
either
this
traffic
or
some
other.
justice
byron

fully

includes

justice

and
the

justice

white
thank
you.
justice
byron

is
that
in
your
brief?
justice
byron

white
that
last
item
that
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the

say?
justice
byron

white
you've
got
to
say
something
more
about

justice

but
they
must
be
recovered.
justice
byron

white
at
some
traffic
some
time.
justice
byron

white
well,
mr.
friedman,
what
if
all
traffic
were
priced
at
that
level?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
come
you
just
now
--
how
come
you're
just
focusing
on
this
particular
traffic?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
all
traffic
item
by
item
and
if
you
did,
you'd
end
up
broke.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
competition
doesn't
remove
the
necessity
from
meeting
those
costs
from
some
place.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
mr.
justice
fortas
--
in
your
discussion,
mr.
justice
fortas,
you
conceded
that
the
--
that
there
was
some
impact
on
the
--
on
the
--
that
if
you
go
below
fully
distributed
cost
and
go
down
to
the
barge
rate
that
the
barges
are
going
to
lose
this
particular
traffic.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
it's
also
--
that's
a
different
point.
that's
a
different
point
in
saying
the
commission
didn't
explain
why
it
was
using
fully
distributed
costs.
it
simply
said
the
barge
lines
aren't
going
to
survive.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
friedman,
i
think
you
were
up
here
several
years
ago
in
national
dairy
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
arguing
what's
an
unreasonable
low
cost.
do
you
think
under
section
3
of
the
clayton
act
that
this
railroad
price
here
would
have
been
at
unreasonably
low
--
this
rate
would
have
been
at
unreasonably
low
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
certainly
must
be
answering
it.
you
must
be
answering
it
no.
you're
saying
that
this
would
be
perfectly
all
right
in
the
--
in
normal
competitive
affairs
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
if
you
price
at
that
out-of-pocket
cost
rather
than
fully
distributed
cost.
and
i
just
want
to
know
for
example
whether
under
section
3
the
railroads
can
do
this
and
still
claim
that
they're
charging
a
reasonable
rate
and
not
unreasonably
lower.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
has
nothing
to
do
--
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
question.
i
didn't
suggest
it.
i
didn't
ask
you
whether
it
would
be
violating
section
3.
i
asked
you
whether
or
not
this
would
be
at
an
unreasonably
lower
rate
under
section
3.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
on
that
basis,
i
take
it
that
the
railroads
didn't
need
to
stop
at
$4.00
--
what
was
the
price
that
was
set
here?
the
rates
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
just
certainly
didn't
need
to
stop
at
$5.11.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
could
have
gone
right
down
to
one
penny
above
their
cost.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
could
have
gone
--
and
you
could
have
gone
to
$4.70
a
ton.
well,
why
did
you
stop
at
$5.11?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
as
long
as
you
have
to
go
to
get
the
traffic.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
irrelevant
to
what
they're
charging
or
you
could
go
right
on
back
down
to
what
you're
saying,
you
could
go
right
down
to
your
cost.
justice
byron
r.
white
surely,
the
person
who
testifies
that
way
wouldn't
say
you
wouldn't
get
it
if
you
were
lower.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
does
still
be
practicable
to
you
in
your
approach
to
get
$4.70.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
other
people
are
then
paying.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
if
you
already
have
your
rate
structured
fixed
before
this
time
to
have
recovered
your
fully
distributed
cost.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
somebody.
justice
byron

white
you're
not
making
a

justice
byron

white
now
what
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
if
your
cost
--
if
you
have
it
by
demand,
you
would
say
you
could
not
put
a
rate
if
below
$5.00
demand?
justice
byron

white
why?
justice
byron

white
but
it
hasn't
anything
to
do
with
the

that
