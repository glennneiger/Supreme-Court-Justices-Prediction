what
did
you
mean
by
different,
you
mean
the
full

the
out-of-pocket
cost?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
that
comply
with
inherent
advantage
situation
or
provision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
the
railroads
making
money
or
losing
money
on
this
one,
as
a
whole?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
do
you
say
that
the
full
cost
is
$7.00
if
they're
making
money.
how
could
they
make
money
if
the
full
cost
is
$7.00
something
and
they
carry
it
to
$5.00?
justice

what
do
you
mean
by
full
cost
--
what
it
actually
cost
for
the
transporter?
justice
hugo
l.
black
will
that
have
to
be
included
in
order
to
show
how
much
it
cost?
how
can
it
be

that?
justice

what's
the
full

of
the

line?
justice
hugo

why
does
--
between

and
$5.00.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
that's
--
what
would
you
call
that?
inherent
advantage?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
the
commission
or
anyone
else
then
go
on
the
basis
of
less
than
the
full
cost
in
determining
the
inherent
advantage?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understood
you
to
say
they
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
total
cost
of
the
railroad
is
$7.00.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
you
understand
the
basis
of
the
commission's
holding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
basis
of
it
is
that
i
understand
from
you
now,
the
full
cost
of
the
railroad
is
$7.00
and
something
and
the
full
cost
of
the
barge
line
is
$5.00.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
they
find
that
if
the
cost
--
the
actual
cost
is
$7.00?
why
can't
they
decide
to
what
the
actual
cost
is?
why
can't
you
get
anything
else
out
of
any
formula
that's
been
created
by
anybody?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
determining
the
inherent
advantage
of
each,
how
can
you
get
away
from
the
fact
that
you
must
consider
the
total
cost
to
the
railroad
and
the
total
cost
to
the
barge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
can
you
get
it
without
some
kind
of
an
artificial
distinction
having
no
basis
in
fact,
away
from
the
fact
inherent
advantage
shown
by
the
full
cost
of
the
railroad

the
full

of
the

justice
hugo

that
you
want
to
choose.
justice
hugo

well,
how
can
you
get
away
from
that
matter
unless
you
have
some
kind
of

that
does
not
meet
the
