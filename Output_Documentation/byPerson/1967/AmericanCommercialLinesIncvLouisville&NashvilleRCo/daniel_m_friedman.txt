mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
opposed
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
this
case
before
the
district
court
and
is
opposing
it
before
this
court
because
it
believes
that
its
decision
in
this
case
is
not
in
conformity
with
the
standards
which
congress
provided
in
section
15a(3)
for
it
to
follow
in
cases
involving
rate
regulation
in
intermodal
competition
situations.
in
the
new
haven
case,
this
court
said
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
purpose
of
this
provision
15a(3)
was
to
permit
the
railroads
to
respond
to
competition
by
asserting
whatever
inherent
advantage
of
cost
and
service
they
possessed.
our
basic
position
before
this
court
in
this
case
is
that
the
commission
here
on
this
record
has
not
given
an
adequate
explanation
as
to
why
the
inherent
advantage
here
doesn't
lie
with
the
railroads
rather
than
as
it
found
with
the
barges.
and
we
think,
as
i
shall
develop,
that
its
decision
turning
down
in
this
case
the
fully
compensatory
rail
rates
on
ingot
molds
in
fact
prevents
the
very
kind
of
vigorous
hard
competition
between
different
modes
of
transportation
that
congress
intended
to
further
in
the
1958
amendments
to
the
act.
now,
i
want
to
state
at
the
very
outset
and
all
candid
that
the
position
we're
taking
in
this
case
here
add
variance
from
the
position
we
took
in
our
brief
before
in
the
new
haven
case
as
was
brought
out
yesterday.
quite
frankly,
we
have
reexamined
our
position
that
we
took
in
new
haven
in
the
light
of
some
intervening
factors.
i'll
just
mention
them
briefly.
first,
that
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
in
the
new
haven
case
the
court
did
not
accept
our
argument.
secondly,
we
have
in
this
case
the
benefit
of
the
economic
testimony
that
was
not
before
the
court
in
the
new
haven
case.
and
finally,
we
have
the
fact
that
in
1966,
the
council
of
economic
advisors
itself
recommended
the
use
of
out-of-pocket
cost
as
the
basis
for
determining
cost
advantage
in
intermodal
situations.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
which,
mr.
justice?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
that
is
set
forth
in
our
brief.
we've
set
forth
in
our
brief
a
reference
that
has
not
been
quoted.
we
set
forth
a
reference
to
the
view
position
taken
by
the
council
of
economic
advisors
and
also
of
the
views
of
the
department
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
council
said
that
they
thought
that
in
intermodal
situations,
the
appropriate
method
for
determining
cost
advantage
for
purposes
of
determining
the
inherent
advantage
should
be
on
the
basis
of
out-of-pocket
cost
rather
than
fully
distributed
cost.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
was
an
--
in
its
general
economic
report
to
the
president
was
discussing
the
various
--
the
whole
economy
and
it
suggested
this,
as
i
shall
develop
when
i
come
to
my
argument.
this
would
lead
to
a
more
efficient
utilization
of
the
nation's
transportation
resources,
this
type
of
pricing.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
yes,
yes.
i'm
going
to
in
a
couple
of
minutes.
i
just
like
at
the
outset,
to
put
the
issue
in
an
appropriate
frame
of
reference,
to
say
a
little
bit
more
as
to
what
is
meant
when
we
talk
here
of
out-of-pocket
as
against
fully
distributed
costs.
by
out-of-pocket,
we
mean
those
costs
that
are
directly
related
to
the
particular
movement
of
traffic
involved.
to
put
it
the
other
way,
these
are
costs
that
would
not
be
incurred
if
the
particular
movement
had
not
been
made,
and
these
are
figured
over
what
we
call
relatively
long
term.
it
isn't
just
limited
to
the
cost
that
would
be
incurred
this
week
in
moving
one
shipment.
it's
the
amount
that
the
particular
type
of
traffic
involved
incurs
as
specific
additional
expenses.
the
long-term
costs
on
the
other
hand
are
costs
that
are
incurred
whether
or
not
the
particular
traffic
is
carried.
and
thus,
by
definition,
these
long-term
costs
do
not
vary
in
respect
to
this
particular
traffic
and
also
bear
no
particular
relation
to
the
traffic.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
must
be
recovered
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
some
time,
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice,
and
we
think
that
--
as
i
shall
develop
when
i
come
in
a
moment
to
the
economic
testimony
that
permitting
pricing
on
an
out-of-pocket
basis,
that
is
pricing
which
gives
the
railroad
its
immediate
expenses
incurred
in
carrying
this
traffic
plus
something
else
as
a
contribution
to
total
costs
actually
results
in
helping
the
achievement
of
meeting
these
total
fixed
costs
rather
than
hurting
it.
and
i
think
that's
the
basic
flow
in
the
entire
argument
that
has
been
made
by
our
opponent.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
obviously
mr.
justice,
if
all
traffic
were
priced
at
this
level,
the
railroad
couldn't
operate
at
a
profit.
it
couldn't
run
that
way.
but
the
fact
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
because
--
because
this
is
the
particular
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
this
--
but
mr.
justice,
in
a
competitive
system
where
someone
is
pricing
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
but
those
costs
under
the
most
economic
utilization
of
resources,
those
costs
will
ultimately
be
met.
mr.
justice,
may
i
say
something
on
this,
that
this
type
of
pricing,
out-of-pocket
pricing
is
not
something
unusual.
it's
not
something
unusual
that
was
resorted
to
just
in
this
particular
case.
now,
this
is
basically,
it
seems
to
us
the
way
in
which
the
railroads
price
at
page
141
of
the
record
in
this
case,
based
on
the
statistics
developed
by
the
commission,
the
witness
stated
that
in
1960,
65%,
almost
two-thirds
of
all
of
this
country's
rail
traffic
moved
at
rates
that
were
below
fully
distributed
costs.
that
is
almost
two-thirds
of
the
total
traffic
in
this
country
moved
at
rates
of
the
type
involved
in
this
case.
now,
i'd
also
like
to
mention
one
other
thing
in
connection
with
the
calculation
of
these
rates.
as
the
commission
determines
out-of-pocket
costs,
that
includes
some
element
of
the
fixed
cost
because
they
do
allow
a
rate
of
return
on
a
part
of
the
carrier's
plant
investment.
they
also
however
in
calculating
fixed
costs
take
into
account
such
things
as
passenger
deficits.
that
has
to
be
made
up
of
course,
but
obviously,
passenger
deficits
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
railroad's
expenses
in
moving
this
particular
freight.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
they
--
it
might
as
a
result
of
that
drop,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
i
think
the
significant
thing
about
this
figure
is
that
at
least
a
few
years
ago,
and
i
assume
it
hasn't
substantially
changed
today
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
i
think
mr.
justice
--
i
think
it's
a
fair
assumption
that
today
still,
still
probably
the
majority
of
rail
traffic
does
move
on
this
basis.
now,
i'd
like
to
come,
if
i
may,
to
the
economic
testimony
in
this
case
because
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
they
do
mr.
justice,
in
one
--
in
one
sense
yes
and
in
one
sense
no.
they
have
to
make
it
up
in
the
sense
that
obviously,
the
total
operation
has
to
be
borne
by
all
of
the
customers
of
the
railroad's
total
expenses.
but
the
fact
is
--
the
fact
is
that
in
this
very
case,
permitting
the
railroad
to
carry
this
traffic
at
a
rate
that
yields
it
more
than
its
out-of-pocket
cost
actually
contributes
something
to
the
total
amount
that
the
railroad
has
to
earn.
in
other
words,
the
other
customers
of
this
railroad
--
and
let's
assume
a
man
who
is
shipping
furniture
and
does
not
have
this
rate,
this
man
is
actually
better
off
in
the
long
run
if
the
railroads
carry
this
traffic
at
this
rate
than
they
don't
because
before
this
rate
was
put
into
effect,
the
railroads
were
carrying
virtually
none
of
this
traffic.
that
meant
there
was
nothing
on
this
traffic
that
was
producing
anything
toward
the
total
of
the
fixed
cost.
under
this
rate
which
caused
the
out-of-pocket
cost
to
roughly
$4.70
when
the
rate
is
$5.11,
that
means
that
for
every
ton
of
ingot
molds
that
moves,
$0.41
is
contributed
toward
meeting
the
railroad's
total
overhead
cost.
now,
in
our
whole
economic
system,
pricing
under
our
system
involves
facing
up
to
the
competitive
situation.
of
course,
where
the
railroads
are
not
faced
with
this
competition,
they're
going
to
price
at
what
the
traffic
will
bear.
this
is
true
of
any
businessman.
if
i'm
a
manufacturer
of
television
sets
and
i
have
a
particular
television
set
which
is
because
of
its
special
characteristics
has
no
competition,
i
am
going
to
try
and
will
be
able
to
get
a
much
higher
rate
of
return
on
the
sales
of
those
sets
than
i
can
get
at
a
set
where
i
have
four
or
five
competitors.
now,
i
got
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
does,
mr.
justice.
it
does
commit
it
to
the
commission
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
our
answer
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
let
me
first
answer
your
first
question
on
what
we
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
recognize,
mr.
justice,
of
course
that
it's
the
commission,
as
this
court
said
in
new
haven,
that
the
determination
of
how
to
preserve
and
further
inherent
advantage
is
a
matter
in
the
--
as
it
said
in
the
first
instance
where
the
commissions
informed
judgment.
our
quarrel
basically
with
the
commission
here
is
that
we
don't
think
they
have
adequately
explained
how
they
reached
their
judgment
in
this
case.
and
we
think
they
haven't
explained
the
in
the
like
of
the
economic
testimony,
which
i'll
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
think
that
the
cost
factors
are
one
element
of
the
national
transportation
policy.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
most
assuredly
there
are.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
think
not,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
challenge
--
we
challenge
that
the
commission
has
given
any
basis
in
this
case
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
took
it
into
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
incorrectly.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
that
the
evidence
is
clear
that
in
this
case
that
this
particular
rate
cut
on
ingot
molds
could
have
no
impact
on
the
ability
of
the
barge
lines
to
compete.
the
barge
lines
themselves,
mr.
justice,
have
conceded
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
they
have
gone
into
effect.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
--
there
is
none
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
mr.
justice,
except
that
the
witnesses
have
testified
that
--
the
barge
witnesses
testified
that
they
could
not
get
this
traffic
at
the
same
rate
as
the
railroad.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it's
--
i
think
as
i
understand
it
in
fact
since
the
rail
rate
has
gone
into
effect,
the
barge
lines
have
not
gotten
any
of
this
traffic.
the
railroads
have
gotten
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
lost
the
traffic.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
that's
precisely
what
we're
saying,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because,
mr.
justice,
there's
nothing
to
show
--
there's
nothing
to
show
that
this
particular
cut
would
have
any
serious
impact
on
the
barge
lines
and
in
any
way
threaten
their
survival.
let
me
come
to
the
--
what
the
commission
said
in
this
case.
the
commission
said
that
this
traffic
is
more
important
to
the
barge
lines
than
the
railroads.
it
said
that
this
particular
broad
category,
iron
and
steel
products
is
the
third
largest
category
of
traffic
that
barges
handle.
it
gives
them
--
it
represents
approximately
11%
of
their
revenues.
now,
i
take
it
the
implication
in
this
is
that
if
this
rate
cut
is
permitted,
therefore
it
will
follow
that
the
railroads
could
make
comparable
rate
cuts
on
all
similar
traffic
and
thus
take
away
from
the
barge
lines
a
total
of
11%
of
their
traffic.
now,
there's
nothing
to
indicate
at
all
in
this
record
that
there's
any
similarity
in
the
conditions
relating
to
these
particular
ingot
molds
and
all
the
rest
of
the
traffic.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
said
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
the
business
of
the
commission,
mr.
justice,
but
the
commission
we
think
has
to
explain
--
has
to
explain
out
of
belief
why
it
reached
its
conclusion.
i
just
like
to
mention
on
the
question
of
the
importance
of
this
traffic.
at
page
3
of
the
brief
for
the
barge
line
appellants
in
this
case,
in
number
797,
they
described
the
ingot
molds
traffic
itself
as
of
minor
traffic
significance.
that's
what
they
themselves
say.
they
themselves
recognized
that
this
particular
item
of
traffic
is
of
minor
significance.
now,
i'd
like
to
come,
if
i
may,
to
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
take
the
position
that
commission
did
not
adequately
explain
in
the
light
of
the
economic
testimony
why
on
this
record
it
was
the
barge
lines
rather
than
the
railroads
that
had
the
inherent
advantage.
in
other
words,
the
commission
did
not
adequately
explain
--
the
commission
did
not
adequately
explain
why
out-of-pocket
rather
than
fully
distributed
was
not
the
appropriate
measure
for
determining
inherent
cost.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
did.
but
my
point
is
that
--
that's
the
essence
of
competition
i
think,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
they
didn't
--
well,
they
said
the
barge
lines
weren't
going
to
survive
but
that
--
they
explained
that
as
the
reason
for
using
fully
distributed
costs.
let
me,
if
i
may,
come
to
what
the
commission
--
the
explanation
the
commission
gave,
and
first
just
by
way
of
a
little
background
what
the
economic
testimony
was
in
this
case.
we
had
four
distinguished
economists
in
this
case
who
dealt
with
the
whole
question
the
economics
of
so-called
incremental
cost
price
fixing.
the
basis
--
the
whole
thing
is
the
railroads
have
already
sunk
into
the
economy
a
great
deal
of
money.
they
have
these
very
heavy
fixed
costs.
and
the
economists
pointed
out
that
if
you
attempt
to
determine
the
inherent
cost
advantage
on
the
basis
of
these
heavy
fixed
costs,
you're
necessarily
introducing
an
arbitrary
element
into
this
situation.
these
costs
are
apportioned
among
the
different
commodities
on
a
basis
that
has
no
direct
relationship,
no
relationship
at
all
to
the
particular
cost
incurred.
and
that
as
long
as
it
--
as
i
get
back
from
carrying
the
particular
commodity
more
than
it
costs
me
out-of-pocket
more
than
my
expenses
of
carrying
the
commodity,
i
am
better
off
than
if
i
didn't
carry
the
commodity
at
all.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
just
can't
answer
that,
mr.
justice
because
in
the
national
dairy
case
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
of
the
least
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice,
of
course
under
section
3,
there's
the
further
element
of
the
predatory
purpose
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
my
own
feeling
is
that
it
would
not
be,
but
i
--
i
have
to
--
i
have
to
qualify
my
answer
because
i
believe
in
the
national
dairy
case,
the
evidence
from
the
case
went
back
in
this
pride
show
that
they
were
below
their
fully
distributed
costs,
but
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
--
that's
the
only
reason
i
would
think
--
i
would
think,
mr.
justice,
that
this
is
the
type
of
pricing
that
it
is
permitted.
now,
the
commission,
when
it
dealt
with
this
economic
evidence,
gave
several
reasons
why
it
said
it
was
not
persuasive.
the
first
reason
it
gave
was
--
basically,
it
said
well,
we
have
always
in
the
past
in
dealing
with
this
problem
of
intermodal
competition
treated
fully
distributed
rather
than
out-of-pocket
cost
as
the
basis
for
determining
inherent
advantage.
they
cited
a
group
of
cases
for
this
proposition
and
with
one
exception
none
of
the
cases
really
discussed
the
economics
of
the
problem
at
all.
the
one
case
that
did
discuss
it
was
the
grain
case
that
mr.
ames
has
relied
on.
now,
i
think
the
significance
of
the
grain
case
is
while
the
commission
said
in
that
case
that
when
dealing
with
competition
between
regulated
modes
of
competition
it
will
look
to
fully
distributed
cost,
the
holding
in
the
case
--
the
holding
in
the
case
was
that
because
the
competing
water
traffic
was
unregulated,
they
would
determine
inherent
advantage
on
the
basis
of
out-of-pocket
costs
and
they
upheld
a
reduced
railroad
rate
because
of
the
fact
that
the
railroad's
rates
were
above
out-of-pocket
costs
even
though
they
were
below
the
barge
lines.
and
i
think
it's
significant
to
see
what
the
commission
said
in
explaining
in
that
case
why
where
you
had
an
unregulated
mode
it
was
appropriate
to
use
out-of-pocket
costs
as
the
basis
for
determining
inherent
advantage
because
it
seems
to
us
the
very
reasoning
the
commission
gave
in
that
case
for
reaching
that
result
there
applies
equally
to
the
situation
present
in
this
case.
what
the
commission
said
is
as
follows
and
this
is
on
321
icc
at
pages
601
to
602.
the
commission
said
the
optimum
utilization
of
this
excess
capacity,
and
it
was
referring
to
the
fact
that
the
railroads
used
the
word
had
sunk
a
great
deal
of
capital
into
excess
capacity.
the
optimum
utilization
of
this
excess
capacity
is
clearly
consistent
with
the
objectives
of
the
national
transportation
policy
provided
that
the
existence
of
such
excess
capacity
is
not
used
as
a
destructive
competitive
weapon,
and
the
fact
that
railroad
rate
was
going
to
be
below
the
barge
rate
and
thus
obviously
take
some
of
the
business
away
was
not
viewed
by
the
commission
as
a
destructive
competitive
weapon.
in
the
instant
proceeding,
it
is
clearly
in
the
public
interest
and
in
furtherance
of
the
national
transportation
policy
to
permit
the
respondents
to
utilize
their
excess
plant
capacity
to
increase
their
net
revenues.
knowing
the
commission
here
has
recognized
the
fact
that
it
benefits
the
railroads,
it
benefits
the
shippers,
it
leads
to
the
more
efficient
utilization
of
the
nation's
transportation
resources
to
permit
the
railroad
to
price
at
a
level
which
produces
something
over
and
above
its
cost
incurred
in
carrying
the
traffic.
now,
the
commission
gave
some
other
explanations
as
to
why
it
felt
that
in
this
case,
fully
distributed
costs
were
the
appropriate
method
of
determining
inherent
cost.
it
said
the
following
at
page
67
to
68
of
the
record,
merely
because
a
carrier
is
able
without
incurring
an
out-of-pocket
loss
to
handle
certain
traffic
at
rates
below
fully
distributed
costs
and
perhaps
by
diverting
sufficient
tonnage
from
its
regulated
competitors
to
maximize
thereby
the
contribution
that
such
traffic
would
make
to
its
overhead
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
carrier
is
the
more
efficient
of
the
two.
well,
it
seems
to
us
that
if
in
fact
one
carrier
can
handle
the
traffic
at
a
lower
rate
than
another
that
is
it
can
sell
its
goods
cheaper
and
still
make
a
profit
that
by
definition
is
the
most
efficient
operator.
what
efficiency
means
in
the
industrial
sense
is
the
ability
to
produce
goods
cheaper.
then
the
commission
made
the
following
statement.
it
said
that
by
reducing
its
rate
--
this
is
at
page
71
of
the
appendix
--
by
reducing
its
rate
below
the
level
of
the
barge-truck
full
costs,
the
respondent
railroads
have
unlawfully
impinged
upon
the
ability
of
the
barge-truck
mode
competitively
to
assert
its
inherent
cost
advantage
--
competitively
to
assert
its
inherent
cost
advantage.
but
long
before,
three
years
before
the
railroads
had
filed
this
rate
reducing
the
level
to
the
barge
lines,
the
barge
lines
themselves
had
put
into
effect
the
rate
of
$5.11
which
is
below
their
fully
distributed
costs
of
$5.19.
now,
there
are
two
other
respects
i'd
like
to
talk
about
in
the
commission's
report,
and
while
we
think
the
commission
in
this
case
has
not
adequately
focused
on
these
issues,
why
we
think
the
commission
has
not
done
the
kind
of
job
it
should
do
if
its
expertise
is
to
be
given
great
weight
by
the
court.
the
commission
focused
exclusively
on
the
cost
aspect
of
inherent
advantage.
the
claim
that
the
barges,
whether
they
have
the
inherent
cost
advantage.
but
inherent
advantage
is,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
new
haven,
has
another
element.
it
includes
service
as
well
as
cost.
and
if
in
fact
at
the
same
rate
the
railroads
are
going
to
get
all
of
this
traffic,
this
would
seem
to
indicate
very
clearly
that
at
least
as
far
as
the
service
advantage
is
concerned,
that
lies
with
the
railroad.
that
it
seems
to
us
is
an
inherent
advantage
of
the
railroad.
and
the
commission
nowhere
in
its
report
attempted
to
deal
with
this
face
of
the
case.
now,
in
addition
with
dealing
with
the
national
transportation
policy,
the
commission
restricted
itself
solely
to
the
provision
that
the
act
is
to
be
administered
to
recognize
and
preserve
the
inherent
advantages
of
each
mode
of
transportation.
the
statute,
however,
directs
the
commission
to
give
due
consideration
to
the
objectives
--
plural,
objectives
--
of
the
national
transportation
policy.
and
the
objectives
of
course
are
not
limited
to
preserving
the
inherent
advantage
of
each
form.
they
more
broadly
included
a
wide
range
of
factors.
particularly,
the
commission
is
enjoined
to
promote
safe,
adequate,
economical
and
efficient
services
and
force
to
sound
economic
conditions
and
transportation.
these
are
factors
which
we
think
in
the
face
of
this
economic
testimony,
the
commission
was
required
to
give
some
consideration
to
explain
in
the
light
of
what
the
realities
are
of
pricing
of
railroad
services,
to
explain
why
permitting
this
type
of
pricing
was
not
in
the
public
interest
in
furthering
these
other
objectives
of
the
act.
now,
mr.
helmetag
who
represents
the
railroads
will
discuss
in
greater
detail
of
a
legislative
history
of
this
statute,
but
we
think
basically
what
is
shown
here
is
the
very
kind
of
hard
competition
that
commerce
intended
in
section
15a(3)
for
the
railroads
to
be
allowed
to
do.
we
think
basically
with
15a(3)
contemplated
was
that
as
long
as
the
railroads
were
able
to
carry
a
product
at
a
figure
above
their
full
--
their
out-of-pocket
costs
and
as
long
as
viewed
in
the
light
of
those
out-of-pocket
costs
a
prima
facie
at
least,
the
railroads
would
have
the
inherent
advantage.
if
that
is
the
situation,
what
commerce
intended
was
to
leave
it
to
the
marketplace,
to
leave
it
to
the
customers
to
decide
which
of
the
competing
modes
of
carriage
they
wish
to
select,
not
to
allow
the
commission
in
fact
to
step
in
and
say
no
because
of
the
fact
that
the
barges
are
going
to
lose
this
little
bit
of
traffic
and
because
we're
concerned
that
if
they
lose
this,
this
will
be
the
opening
wedge.
therefore,
it
must
be
stopped.
and
i
would
like
to
close,
if
i
may,
with
two
sentences
from
this
court's
opinion
in
the
new
haven
decision
where
this
court
said,
if
there
is
one
fact
that
stands
out
in
bold
relief
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
15a(3),
it
is
that
congress
did
not
regard
the
setting
of
a
rate
at
a
particular
level
as
constituting
an
unfair
or
destructive
competitive
practice
simply
because
the
rate
would
divert
some
or
all
of
the
traffic
from
a
competing
mode.
if
a
carrier
is
prohibited
from
establishing
a
reduced
rate
that
is
not
detrimental
to
its
own
revenue
requirements
merely
because
the
rate
will
divert
traffic
from
others,
then
the
carrier
is
thwarted
from
asserting
its
own
inherent
advantages
of
cost
and
service.
and
we
think
that
is
precisely
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
answered
that
mr.
chief
justice.
yes,
it
is
the
proper
rate
making
because
i
think
the
idea
that
--
but
omitting
this
kind
of
rate
making
on
this
particular
commodity,
you're
loading
the
course
on
to
the
other,
to
the
other
shippers.
i
suggest
that
in
fact
they're
not
loading
the
cost
on
your
permitting
in
fact
the
cost
to
be
reduced.
that
is
if
i
may
suggest
come
back
again
on
this
particular
shipment
by
providing
the
carrier
with
additional
revenue,
it
would
not
have
received
had
it
not
been
carrying
the
ingot
molds
traffic
and
it's
clear
that
unless
they
came
down
to
the
barge
rate,
they
couldn't
get
it
by
enabling
the
carrier
to
get
this
additional
revenue,
this
additional
revenue
which
would
not
otherwise
has
gotten.
the
other
shippers
are
actually
better
off
in
the
long
run
because
they
have
to
bear
less
of
this
burden
for
each
ton
of
ingot
molds
that
moves,
the
man
who
is
shipping
try
--
furniture
or
the
man
who
is
shipping
building
blocks,
the
man
who
is
shipping
anything
else
has
in
the
totality,
these
other
shippers
have
to
pay
$0.41
less
to
the
overheard
cost.
and
the
very
nature
of
competition
is
such
i
think
that
when
you
are
faced
with
a
competitive
situation,
what
you
will
do
is
to
set
your
price
at
a
level
that
will
maximize
the
profits
from
that
traffic.
if
you
have
a
competitor,
if
you're
competing
with
another
form
of
transportation,
you
have
to
make
your
rate
competitive
if
you
hope
to
get
that.
if
you
don't
have
the
competitor,
you
don't
get
it
but
there's
nothing,
if
i
may
use
the
word
insidious
about
this
rate
making
scheme
as
there's
not
really
loading
the
cost
of
the
total
fixed
cost
on
the
other
shippers.
in
the
long
run,
the
other
shippers
benefit
because
as
the
result
of
this
form
of
rate
making,
the
total
cost
that
they
have
to
meet
are
help
buttons,
they're
not
handed
by
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
think
it
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
in
the
last
analysis,
it
is
for
the
commission
to
determine
but
we
think
in
this
case,
the
commission
--
and
in
determining
this,
it
seems
to
me
the
commission
has
to
make
a
reason
satisfactory
explanation
as
to
why
it
reached
that
result
and
we
don't
think
it
has
done
it
in
this
case.
the
reasons
we
think
the
commission
has
given
do
not
justify
its
conclusion.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
district
court's
order
itself
has
remanded
this
case
to
the
commission
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
its
opinion
and
we
are
urging
affirmance
of
that.
we
think
this
case
must
go
back
to
the
commission
for
reconsideration.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
compared
with
the
barges.
yes,
the
barges
have
very
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
can't
--
not
necessary.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
they
might
depend
on
the
fact
of
a
particular
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
they
do
have
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
as
to
the
latter
mr.
justice,
we
felt
that
as
a
party
in
this
case,
it
was
our
--
it
was
appropriate
for
us
to
indicate
to
the
court
the
reasons
why
we
would
disturb
in
trouble
by
the
way
the
commission
had
decided
this
case.
now
i
think
it's
true
that
probably
in
most
instances
of
this
type,
the
inherent
advantage
maybe
with
the
railroads.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
suggest
two
things
mr.
justice.
first,
i
cannot
say
and
i
just
don't
know
whether
in
every
case
that
would
be
the
fact
and
that
in
many
situations
where
even
though
the
actual
movement
to
transportation
by
barge
may
have
higher
out-of-pocket
cost
than
higher
out-of-pocket
cost
in
rail
but
maybe
other
problems
that
maybe
for
example
in
this
very
case,
the
barge
transportation
had
additional
charge
as
truck
trans
like
at
the
end
of
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
icc
should
know
and
we
think
if
the
icc
would
adequately
explain
why
it
has
selected
fully
distributed
rather
than
out-of-pocket,
that
maybe
an
area
where
it
would
be
within
the
informed
discretion
and
not
subject
to
reversal
by
the
courts.
but
in
this
case,
we
think
it
hasn't
done
that.
i
suggest
the
concertinos
opinion
in
vain
for
any
reason
to
explanation
that
deals
with
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
deals
with
the
record
other
than
wearing
the
most
conclusively
on
its
statement.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
that
as
i
suggested
mr.
justice
does
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
an
explanation
for
where
it
were
sound
one
but
that
explanation
i
think
is
not
supported
by
this
record.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
it
was
supported
by
this
record.
it
would
have
to
--
they
would
have
to
show
that
there
is
some
real
danger
that
by
permitting
the
ingot
molds,
that
permitting
this
type
of
rate
to
go
in
effect
on
ingot
mold,
this
would
carry
over
to
the
entire
contraries
of
traffic
and
would
enable
the
railroads
to
really
--
to
club
the
barges
to
death
and
we
don't
think
there
is
any
basis
for
that
contention.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
opposed
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
this
case
before
the
district
court
and
is
opposing
it
before
this
court
because
it
believes
that
its
decision
in
this
case
is
not
in
conformity
with
the
standards
which
congress
provided
in
section
15a(3)
for
it
to
follow
in
cases
involving
rate
regulation
in
intermodal
competition
situations.
in
the
new
haven
case,
this
court
said
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
purpose
of
this
provision
15a(3)
was
to
permit
the
railroads
to
respond
to
competition
by
asserting
whatever
inherent
advantage
of
cost
and
service
they
possessed.
our
basic
position
before
this
court
in
this
case
is
that
the
commission
here
on
this
record
has
not
given
an
adequate
explanation
as
to
why
the
inherent
advantage
here
doesn't
lie
with
the
railroads
rather
than
as
it
found
with
the
barges.
and
we
think,
as
i
shall
develop,
that
its
decision
turning
down
in
this
case
the
fully
compensatory
rail
rates
on
ingot
molds
in
fact
prevents
the
very
kind
of
vigorous
hard
competition
between
different
modes
of
transportation
that
congress
intended
to
further
in
the
1958
amendments
to
the
act.
now,
i
want
to
state
at
the
very
outset
and
all
candid
that
the
position
we're
taking
in
this
case
here
add
variance
from
the
position
we
took
in
our
brief
before
in
the
new
haven
case
as
was
brought
out
yesterday.
quite
frankly,
we
have
reexamined
our
position
that
we
took
in
new
haven
in
the
light
of
some
intervening
factors.
i'll
just
mention
them
briefly.
first,
that
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
in
the
new
haven
case
the
court
did
not
accept
our
argument.
secondly,
we
have
in
this
case
the
benefit
of
the
economic
testimony
that
was
not
before
the
court
in
the
new
haven
case.
and
finally,
we
have
the
fact
that
in
1966,
the
council
of
economic
advisors
itself
recommended
the
use
of
out-of-pocket
cost
as
the
basis
for
determining
cost
advantage
in
intermodal
situations.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
which,
mr.
justice?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
that
is
set
forth
in
our
brief.
we've
set
forth
in
our
brief
a
reference
that
has
not
been
quoted.
we
set
forth
a
reference
to
the
view
position
taken
by
the
council
of
economic
advisors
and
also
of
the
views
of
the
department
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
council
said
that
they
thought
that
in
intermodal
situations,
the
appropriate
method
for
determining
cost
advantage
for
purposes
of
determining
the
inherent
advantage
should
be
on
the
basis
of
out-of-pocket
cost
rather
than
fully
distributed
cost.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
was
an
--
in
its
general
economic
report
to
the
president
was
discussing
the
various
--
the
whole
economy
and
it
suggested
this,
as
i
shall
develop
when
i
come
to
my
argument.
this
would
lead
to
a
more
efficient
utilization
of
the
nation's
transportation
resources,
this
type
of
pricing.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
yes,
yes.
i'm
going
to
in
a
couple
of
minutes.
i
just
like
at
the
outset,
to
put
the
issue
in
an
appropriate
frame
of
reference,
to
say
a
little
bit
more
as
to
what
is
meant
when
we
talk
here
of
out-of-pocket
as
against
fully
distributed
costs.
by
out-of-pocket,
we
mean
those
costs
that
are
directly
related
to
the
particular
movement
of
traffic
involved.
to
put
it
the
other
way,
these
are
costs
that
would
not
be
incurred
if
the
particular
movement
had
not
been
made,
and
these
are
figured
over
what
we
call
relatively
long
term.
it
isn't
just
limited
to
the
cost
that
would
be
incurred
this
week
in
moving
one
shipment.
it's
the
amount
that
the
particular
type
of
traffic
involved
incurs
as
specific
additional
expenses.
the
long-term
costs
on
the
other
hand
are
costs
that
are
incurred
whether
or
not
the
particular
traffic
is
carried.
and
thus,
by
definition,
these
long-term
costs
do
not
vary
in
respect
to
this
particular
traffic
and
also
bear
no
particular
relation
to
the
traffic.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
must
be
recovered
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
some
time,
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice,
and
we
think
that
--
as
i
shall
develop
when
i
come
in
a
moment
to
the
economic
testimony
that
permitting
pricing
on
an
out-of-pocket
basis,
that
is
pricing
which
gives
the
railroad
its
immediate
expenses
incurred
in
carrying
this
traffic
plus
something
else
as
a
contribution
to
total
costs
actually
results
in
helping
the
achievement
of
meeting
these
total
fixed
costs
rather
than
hurting
it.
and
i
think
that's
the
basic
flow
in
the
entire
argument
that
has
been
made
by
our
opponent.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
obviously
mr.
justice,
if
all
traffic
were
priced
at
this
level,
the
railroad
couldn't
operate
at
a
profit.
it
couldn't
run
that
way.
but
the
fact
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
because
--
because
this
is
the
particular
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
this
--
but
mr.
justice,
in
a
competitive
system
where
someone
is
pricing
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
but
those
costs
under
the
most
economic
utilization
of
resources,
those
costs
will
ultimately
be
met.
mr.
justice,
may
i
say
something
on
this,
that
this
type
of
pricing,
out-of-pocket
pricing
is
not
something
unusual.
it's
not
something
unusual
that
was
resorted
to
just
in
this
particular
case.
now,
this
is
basically,
it
seems
to
us
the
way
in
which
the
railroads
price
at
page
141
of
the
record
in
this
case,
based
on
the
statistics
developed
by
the
commission,
the
witness
stated
that
in
1960,
65%,
almost
two-thirds
of
all
of
this
country's
rail
traffic
moved
at
rates
that
were
below
fully
distributed
costs.
that
is
almost
two-thirds
of
the
total
traffic
in
this
country
moved
at
rates
of
the
type
involved
in
this
case.
now,
i'd
also
like
to
mention
one
other
thing
in
connection
with
the
calculation
of
these
rates.
as
the
commission
determines
out-of-pocket
costs,
that
includes
some
element
of
the
fixed
cost
because
they
do
allow
a
rate
of
return
on
a
part
of
the
carrier's
plant
investment.
they
also
however
in
calculating
fixed
costs
take
into
account
such
things
as
passenger
deficits.
that
has
to
be
made
up
of
course,
but
obviously,
passenger
deficits
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
railroad's
expenses
in
moving
this
particular
freight.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
they
--
it
might
as
a
result
of
that
drop,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
i
think
the
significant
thing
about
this
figure
is
that
at
least
a
few
years
ago,
and
i
assume
it
hasn't
substantially
changed
today
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
i
think
mr.
justice
--
i
think
it's
a
fair
assumption
that
today
still,
still
probably
the
majority
of
rail
traffic
does
move
on
this
basis.
now,
i'd
like
to
come,
if
i
may,
to
the
economic
testimony
in
this
case
because
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
they
do
mr.
justice,
in
one
--
in
one
sense
yes
and
in
one
sense
no.
they
have
to
make
it
up
in
the
sense
that
obviously,
the
total
operation
has
to
be
borne
by
all
of
the
customers
of
the
railroad's
total
expenses.
but
the
fact
is
--
the
fact
is
that
in
this
very
case,
permitting
the
railroad
to
carry
this
traffic
at
a
rate
that
yields
it
more
than
its
out-of-pocket
cost
actually
contributes
something
to
the
total
amount
that
the
railroad
has
to
earn.
in
other
words,
the
other
customers
of
this
railroad
--
and
let's
assume
a
man
who
is
shipping
furniture
and
does
not
have
this
rate,
this
man
is
actually
better
off
in
the
long
run
if
the
railroads
carry
this
traffic
at
this
rate
than
they
don't
because
before
this
rate
was
put
into
effect,
the
railroads
were
carrying
virtually
none
of
this
traffic.
that
meant
there
was
nothing
on
this
traffic
that
was
producing
anything
toward
the
total
of
the
fixed
cost.
under
this
rate
which
caused
the
out-of-pocket
cost
to
roughly
$4.70
when
the
rate
is
$5.11,
that
means
that
for
every
ton
of
ingot
molds
that
moves,
$0.41
is
contributed
toward
meeting
the
railroad's
total
overhead
cost.
now,
in
our
whole
economic
system,
pricing
under
our
system
involves
facing
up
to
the
competitive
situation.
of
course,
where
the
railroads
are
not
faced
with
this
competition,
they're
going
to
price
at
what
the
traffic
will
bear.
this
is
true
of
any
businessman.
if
i'm
a
manufacturer
of
television
sets
and
i
have
a
particular
television
set
which
is
because
of
its
special
characteristics
has
no
competition,
i
am
going
to
try
and
will
be
able
to
get
a
much
higher
rate
of
return
on
the
sales
of
those
sets
than
i
can
get
at
a
set
where
i
have
four
or
five
competitors.
now,
i
got
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
does,
mr.
justice.
it
does
commit
it
to
the
commission
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
our
answer
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
let
me
first
answer
your
first
question
on
what
we
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
recognize,
mr.
justice,
of
course
that
it's
the
commission,
as
this
court
said
in
new
haven,
that
the
determination
of
how
to
preserve
and
further
inherent
advantage
is
a
matter
in
the
--
as
it
said
in
the
first
instance
where
the
commissions
informed
judgment.
our
quarrel
basically
with
the
commission
here
is
that
we
don't
think
they
have
adequately
explained
how
they
reached
their
judgment
in
this
case.
and
we
think
they
haven't
explained
the
in
the
like
of
the
economic
testimony,
which
i'll
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
think
that
the
cost
factors
are
one
element
of
the
national
transportation
policy.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
most
assuredly
there
are.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
think
not,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
challenge
--
we
challenge
that
the
commission
has
given
any
basis
in
this
case
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
took
it
into
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
incorrectly.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
that
the
evidence
is
clear
that
in
this
case
that
this
particular
rate
cut
on
ingot
molds
could
have
no
impact
on
the
ability
of
the
barge
lines
to
compete.
the
barge
lines
themselves,
mr.
justice,
have
conceded
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
they
have
gone
into
effect.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
--
there
is
none
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
mr.
justice,
except
that
the
witnesses
have
testified
that
--
the
barge
witnesses
testified
that
they
could
not
get
this
traffic
at
the
same
rate
as
the
railroad.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it's
--
i
think
as
i
understand
it
in
fact
since
the
rail
rate
has
gone
into
effect,
the
barge
lines
have
not
gotten
any
of
this
traffic.
the
railroads
have
gotten
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
lost
the
traffic.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
that's
precisely
what
we're
saying,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because,
mr.
justice,
there's
nothing
to
show
--
there's
nothing
to
show
that
this
particular
cut
would
have
any
serious
impact
on
the
barge
lines
and
in
any
way
threaten
their
survival.
let
me
come
to
the
--
what
the
commission
said
in
this
case.
the
commission
said
that
this
traffic
is
more
important
to
the
barge
lines
than
the
railroads.
it
said
that
this
particular
broad
category,
iron
and
steel
products
is
the
third
largest
category
of
traffic
that
barges
handle.
it
gives
them
--
it
represents
approximately
11%
of
their
revenues.
now,
i
take
it
the
implication
in
this
is
that
if
this
rate
cut
is
permitted,
therefore
it
will
follow
that
the
railroads
could
make
comparable
rate
cuts
on
all
similar
traffic
and
thus
take
away
from
the
barge
lines
a
total
of
11%
of
their
traffic.
now,
there's
nothing
to
indicate
at
all
in
this
record
that
there's
any
similarity
in
the
conditions
relating
to
these
particular
ingot
molds
and
all
the
rest
of
the
traffic.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
said
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
the
business
of
the
commission,
mr.
justice,
but
the
commission
we
think
has
to
explain
--
has
to
explain
out
of
belief
why
it
reached
its
conclusion.
i
just
like
to
mention
on
the
question
of
the
importance
of
this
traffic.
at
page
3
of
the
brief
for
the
barge
line
appellants
in
this
case,
in
number
797,
they
described
the
ingot
molds
traffic
itself
as
of
minor
traffic
significance.
that's
what
they
themselves
say.
they
themselves
recognized
that
this
particular
item
of
traffic
is
of
minor
significance.
now,
i'd
like
to
come,
if
i
may,
to
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
take
the
position
that
commission
did
not
adequately
explain
in
the
light
of
the
economic
testimony
why
on
this
record
it
was
the
barge
lines
rather
than
the
railroads
that
had
the
inherent
advantage.
in
other
words,
the
commission
did
not
adequately
explain
--
the
commission
did
not
adequately
explain
why
out-of-pocket
rather
than
fully
distributed
was
not
the
appropriate
measure
for
determining
inherent
cost.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
did.
but
my
point
is
that
--
that's
the
essence
of
competition
i
think,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
they
didn't
--
well,
they
said
the
barge
lines
weren't
going
to
survive
but
that
--
they
explained
that
as
the
reason
for
using
fully
distributed
costs.
let
me,
if
i
may,
come
to
what
the
commission
--
the
explanation
the
commission
gave,
and
first
just
by
way
of
a
little
background
what
the
economic
testimony
was
in
this
case.
we
had
four
distinguished
economists
in
this
case
who
dealt
with
the
whole
question
the
economics
of
so-called
incremental
cost
price
fixing.
the
basis
--
the
whole
thing
is
the
railroads
have
already
sunk
into
the
economy
a
great
deal
of
money.
they
have
these
very
heavy
fixed
costs.
and
the
economists
pointed
out
that
if
you
attempt
to
determine
the
inherent
cost
advantage
on
the
basis
of
these
heavy
fixed
costs,
you're
necessarily
introducing
an
arbitrary
element
into
this
situation.
these
costs
are
apportioned
among
the
different
commodities
on
a
basis
that
has
no
direct
relationship,
no
relationship
at
all
to
the
particular
cost
incurred.
and
that
as
long
as
it
--
as
i
get
back
from
carrying
the
particular
commodity
more
than
it
costs
me
out-of-pocket
more
than
my
expenses
of
carrying
the
commodity,
i
am
better
off
than
if
i
didn't
carry
the
commodity
at
all.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
just
can't
answer
that,
mr.
justice
because
in
the
national
dairy
case
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
of
the
least
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice,
of
course
under
section
3,
there's
the
further
element
of
the
predatory
purpose
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
my
own
feeling
is
that
it
would
not
be,
but
i
--
i
have
to
--
i
have
to
qualify
my
answer
because
i
believe
in
the
national
dairy
case,
the
evidence
from
the
case
went
back
in
this
pride
show
that
they
were
below
their
fully
distributed
costs,
but
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
--
that's
the
only
reason
i
would
think
--
i
would
think,
mr.
justice,
that
this
is
the
type
of
pricing
that
it
is
permitted.
now,
the
commission,
when
it
dealt
with
this
economic
evidence,
gave
several
reasons
why
it
said
it
was
not
persuasive.
the
first
reason
it
gave
was
--
basically,
it
said
well,
we
have
always
in
the
past
in
dealing
with
this
problem
of
intermodal
competition
treated
fully
distributed
rather
than
out-of-pocket
cost
as
the
basis
for
determining
inherent
advantage.
they
cited
a
group
of
cases
for
this
proposition
and
with
one
exception
none
of
the
cases
really
discussed
the
economics
of
the
problem
at
all.
the
one
case
that
did
discuss
it
was
the
grain
case
that
mr.
ames
has
relied
on.
now,
i
think
the
significance
of
the
grain
case
is
while
the
commission
said
in
that
case
that
when
dealing
with
competition
between
regulated
modes
of
competition
it
will
look
to
fully
distributed
cost,
the
holding
in
the
case
--
the
holding
in
the
case
was
that
because
the
competing
water
traffic
was
unregulated,
they
would
determine
inherent
advantage
on
the
basis
of
out-of-pocket
costs
and
they
upheld
a
reduced
railroad
rate
because
of
the
fact
that
the
railroad's
rates
were
above
out-of-pocket
costs
even
though
they
were
below
the
barge
lines.
and
i
think
it's
significant
to
see
what
the
commission
said
in
explaining
in
that
case
why
where
you
had
an
unregulated
mode
it
was
appropriate
to
use
out-of-pocket
costs
as
the
basis
for
determining
inherent
advantage
because
it
seems
to
us
the
very
reasoning
the
commission
gave
in
that
case
for
reaching
that
result
there
applies
equally
to
the
situation
present
in
this
case.
what
the
commission
said
is
as
follows
and
this
is
on
321
icc
at
pages
601
to
602.
the
commission
said
the
optimum
utilization
of
this
excess
capacity,
and
it
was
referring
to
the
fact
that
the
railroads
used
the
word
had
sunk
a
great
deal
of
capital
into
excess
capacity.
the
optimum
utilization
of
this
excess
capacity
is
clearly
consistent
with
the
objectives
of
the
national
transportation
policy
provided
that
the
existence
of
such
excess
capacity
is
not
used
as
a
destructive
competitive
weapon,
and
the
fact
that
railroad
rate
was
going
to
be
below
the
barge
rate
and
thus
obviously
take
some
of
the
business
away
was
not
viewed
by
the
commission
as
a
destructive
competitive
weapon.
in
the
instant
proceeding,
it
is
clearly
in
the
public
interest
and
in
furtherance
of
the
national
transportation
policy
to
permit
the
respondents
to
utilize
their
excess
plant
capacity
to
increase
their
net
revenues.
knowing
the
commission
here
has
recognized
the
fact
that
it
benefits
the
railroads,
it
benefits
the
shippers,
it
leads
to
the
more
efficient
utilization
of
the
nation's
transportation
resources
to
permit
the
railroad
to
price
at
a
level
which
produces
something
over
and
above
its
cost
incurred
in
carrying
the
traffic.
now,
the
commission
gave
some
other
explanations
as
to
why
it
felt
that
in
this
case,
fully
distributed
costs
were
the
appropriate
method
of
determining
inherent
cost.
it
said
the
following
at
page
67
to
68
of
the
record,
merely
because
a
carrier
is
able
without
incurring
an
out-of-pocket
loss
to
handle
certain
traffic
at
rates
below
fully
distributed
costs
and
perhaps
by
diverting
sufficient
tonnage
from
its
regulated
competitors
to
maximize
thereby
the
contribution
that
such
traffic
would
make
to
its
overhead
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
carrier
is
the
more
efficient
of
the
two.
well,
it
seems
to
us
that
if
in
fact
one
carrier
can
handle
the
traffic
at
a
lower
rate
than
another
that
is
it
can
sell
its
goods
cheaper
and
still
make
a
profit
that
by
definition
is
the
most
efficient
operator.
what
efficiency
means
in
the
industrial
sense
is
the
ability
to
produce
goods
cheaper.
then
the
commission
made
the
following
statement.
it
said
that
by
reducing
its
rate
--
this
is
at
page
71
of
the
appendix
--
by
reducing
its
rate
below
the
level
of
the
barge-truck
full
costs,
the
respondent
railroads
have
unlawfully
impinged
upon
the
ability
of
the
barge-truck
mode
competitively
to
assert
its
inherent
cost
advantage
--
competitively
to
assert
its
inherent
cost
advantage.
but
long
before,
three
years
before
the
railroads
had
filed
this
rate
reducing
the
level
to
the
barge
lines,
the
barge
lines
themselves
had
put
into
effect
the
rate
of
$5.11
which
is
below
their
fully
distributed
costs
of
$5.19.
now,
there
are
two
other
respects
i'd
like
to
talk
about
in
the
commission's
report,
and
while
we
think
the
commission
in
this
case
has
not
adequately
focused
on
these
issues,
why
we
think
the
commission
has
not
done
the
kind
of
job
it
should
do
if
its
expertise
is
to
be
given
great
weight
by
the
court.
the
commission
focused
exclusively
on
the
cost
aspect
of
inherent
advantage.
the
claim
that
the
barges,
whether
they
have
the
inherent
cost
advantage.
but
inherent
advantage
is,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
new
haven,
has
another
element.
it
includes
service
as
well
as
cost.
and
if
in
fact
at
the
same
rate
the
railroads
are
going
to
get
all
of
this
traffic,
this
would
seem
to
indicate
very
clearly
that
at
least
as
far
as
the
service
advantage
is
concerned,
that
lies
with
the
railroad.
that
it
seems
to
us
is
an
inherent
advantage
of
the
railroad.
and
the
commission
nowhere
in
its
report
attempted
to
deal
with
this
face
of
the
case.
now,
in
addition
with
dealing
with
the
national
transportation
policy,
the
commission
restricted
itself
solely
to
the
provision
that
the
act
is
to
be
administered
to
recognize
and
preserve
the
inherent
advantages
of
each
mode
of
transportation.
the
statute,
however,
directs
the
commission
to
give
due
consideration
to
the
objectives
--
plural,
objectives
--
of
the
national
transportation
policy.
and
the
objectives
of
course
are
not
limited
to
preserving
the
inherent
advantage
of
each
form.
they
more
broadly
included
a
wide
range
of
factors.
particularly,
the
commission
is
enjoined
to
promote
safe,
adequate,
economical
and
efficient
services
and
force
to
sound
economic
conditions
and
transportation.
these
are
factors
which
we
think
in
the
face
of
this
economic
testimony,
the
commission
was
required
to
give
some
consideration
to
explain
in
the
light
of
what
the
realities
are
of
pricing
of
railroad
services,
to
explain
why
permitting
this
type
of
pricing
was
not
in
the
public
interest
in
furthering
these
other
objectives
of
the
act.
now,
mr.
helmetag
who
represents
the
railroads
will
discuss
in
greater
detail
of
a
legislative
history
of
this
statute,
but
we
think
basically
what
is
shown
here
is
the
very
kind
of
hard
competition
that
commerce
intended
in
section
15a(3)
for
the
railroads
to
be
allowed
to
do.
we
think
basically
with
15a(3)
contemplated
was
that
as
long
as
the
railroads
were
able
to
carry
a
product
at
a
figure
above
their
full
--
their
out-of-pocket
costs
and
as
long
as
viewed
in
the
light
of
those
out-of-pocket
costs
a
prima
facie
at
least,
the
railroads
would
have
the
inherent
advantage.
if
that
is
the
situation,
what
commerce
intended
was
to
leave
it
to
the
marketplace,
to
leave
it
to
the
customers
to
decide
which
of
the
competing
modes
of
carriage
they
wish
to
select,
not
to
allow
the
commission
in
fact
to
step
in
and
say
no
because
of
the
fact
that
the
barges
are
going
to
lose
this
little
bit
of
traffic
and
because
we're
concerned
that
if
they
lose
this,
this
will
be
the
opening
wedge.
therefore,
it
must
be
stopped.
and
i
would
like
to
close,
if
i
may,
with
two
sentences
from
this
court's
opinion
in
the
new
haven
decision
where
this
court
said,
if
there
is
one
fact
that
stands
out
in
bold
relief
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
15a(3),
it
is
that
congress
did
not
regard
the
setting
of
a
rate
at
a
particular
level
as
constituting
an
unfair
or
destructive
competitive
practice
simply
because
the
rate
would
divert
some
or
all
of
the
traffic
from
a
competing
mode.
if
a
carrier
is
prohibited
from
establishing
a
reduced
rate
that
is
not
detrimental
to
its
own
revenue
requirements
merely
because
the
rate
will
divert
traffic
from
others,
then
the
carrier
is
thwarted
from
asserting
its
own
inherent
advantages
of
cost
and
service.
and
we
think
that
is
precisely
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
answered
that
mr.
chief
justice.
yes,
it
is
the
proper
rate
making
because
i
think
the
idea
that
--
but
omitting
this
kind
of
rate
making
on
this
particular
commodity,
you're
loading
the
course
on
to
the
other,
to
the
other
shippers.
i
suggest
that
in
fact
they're
not
loading
the
cost
on
your
permitting
in
fact
the
cost
to
be
reduced.
that
is
if
i
may
suggest
come
back
again
on
this
particular
shipment
by
providing
the
carrier
with
additional
revenue,
it
would
not
have
received
had
it
not
been
carrying
the
ingot
molds
traffic
and
it's
clear
that
unless
they
came
down
to
the
barge
rate,
they
couldn't
get
it
by
enabling
the
carrier
to
get
this
additional
revenue,
this
additional
revenue
which
would
not
otherwise
has
gotten.
the
other
shippers
are
actually
better
off
in
the
long
run
because
they
have
to
bear
less
of
this
burden
for
each
ton
of
ingot
molds
that
moves,
the
man
who
is
shipping
try
--
furniture
or
the
man
who
is
shipping
building
blocks,
the
man
who
is
shipping
anything
else
has
in
the
totality,
these
other
shippers
have
to
pay
$0.41
less
to
the
overheard
cost.
and
the
very
nature
of
competition
is
such
i
think
that
when
you
are
faced
with
a
competitive
situation,
what
you
will
do
is
to
set
your
price
at
a
level
that
will
maximize
the
profits
from
that
traffic.
if
you
have
a
competitor,
if
you're
competing
with
another
form
of
transportation,
you
have
to
make
your
rate
competitive
if
you
hope
to
get
that.
if
you
don't
have
the
competitor,
you
don't
get
it
but
there's
nothing,
if
i
may
use
the
word
insidious
about
this
rate
making
scheme
as
there's
not
really
loading
the
cost
of
the
total
fixed
cost
on
the
other
shippers.
in
the
long
run,
the
other
shippers
benefit
because
as
the
result
of
this
form
of
rate
making,
the
total
cost
that
they
have
to
meet
are
help
buttons,
they're
not
handed
by
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
think
it
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
in
the
last
analysis,
it
is
for
the
commission
to
determine
but
we
think
in
this
case,
the
commission
--
and
in
determining
this,
it
seems
to
me
the
commission
has
to
make
a
reason
satisfactory
explanation
as
to
why
it
reached
that
result
and
we
don't
think
it
has
done
it
in
this
case.
the
reasons
we
think
the
commission
has
given
do
not
justify
its
conclusion.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
district
court's
order
itself
has
remanded
this
case
to
the
commission
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
its
opinion
and
we
are
urging
affirmance
of
that.
we
think
this
case
must
go
back
to
the
commission
for
reconsideration.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
compared
with
the
barges.
yes,
the
barges
have
very
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
can't
--
not
necessary.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
they
might
depend
on
the
fact
of
a
particular
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
they
do
have
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
as
to
the
latter
mr.
justice,
we
felt
that
as
a
party
in
this
case,
it
was
our
--
it
was
appropriate
for
us
to
indicate
to
the
court
the
reasons
why
we
would
disturb
in
trouble
by
the
way
the
commission
had
decided
this
case.
now
i
think
it's
true
that
probably
in
most
instances
of
this
type,
the
inherent
advantage
maybe
with
the
railroads.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
suggest
two
things
mr.
justice.
first,
i
cannot
say
and
i
just
don't
know
whether
in
every
case
that
would
be
the
fact
and
that
in
many
situations
where
even
though
the
actual
movement
to
transportation
by
barge
may
have
higher
out-of-pocket
cost
than
higher
out-of-pocket
cost
in
rail
but
maybe
other
problems
that
maybe
for
example
in
this
very
case,
the
barge
transportation
had
additional
charge
as
truck
trans
like
at
the
end
of
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
icc
should
know
and
we
think
if
the
icc
would
adequately
explain
why
it
has
selected
fully
distributed
rather
than
out-of-pocket,
that
maybe
an
area
where
it
would
be
within
the
informed
discretion
and
not
subject
to
reversal
by
the
courts.
but
in
this
case,
we
think
it
hasn't
done
that.
i
suggest
the
concertinos
opinion
in
vain
for
any
reason
to
explanation
that
deals
with
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
deals
with
the
record
other
than
wearing
the
most
conclusively
on
its
statement.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
that
as
i
suggested
mr.
justice
does
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
an
explanation
for
where
it
were
sound
one
but
that
explanation
i
think
is
not
supported
by
this
record.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
it
was
supported
by
this
record.
it
would
have
to
--
they
would
have
to
show
that
there
is
some
real
danger
that
by
permitting
the
ingot
molds,
that
permitting
this
type
of
rate
to
go
in
effect
on
ingot
mold,
this
would
carry
over
to
the
entire
contraries
of
traffic
and
would
enable
the
railroads
to
really
--
to
club
the
barges
to
death
and
we
don't
think
there
is
any
basis
for
that
contention.
