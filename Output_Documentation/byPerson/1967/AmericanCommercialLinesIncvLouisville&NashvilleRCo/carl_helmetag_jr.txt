mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
court.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
i'm
appearing
here
today
on
behalf
of
the
railroad
appellees
both
the
principal
appellees
which
included
the
railroads
that
published
this
rate
mainly
the
what
have
now
the
penn
central
company
and
the
louisville
and
nashville
railroad
and
also
for
the
large
group
of
railroads
that
intervened
in
the
proceedings
below
in
support
of
the
principal
railroad
appellant
in
that
case.
i
would
say
at
the
outset
that
our
position
here
is
the
same
as
the
position
that
--
which
mr.
friedman
has
advanced
for
the
united
states
government
and
it's
the
same
position
that
the
antitrust
division
of
the
department
of
justice
took
in
the
court
below.
i
think
it
might
be
well
to
emphasize
at
the
outset
one
of
the
points
that
mr.
friedman
touched
upon.
this
particular
ingot
mold
rate
involves
a
very
small
amount
of
traffic
some
4,000
tons
of
business
a
year
moving
in
barges
or
in
rail
cart
and
600-ton
shipment
about
eight
or
ten
shipments
a
year.
this
rate
which
the
railroad
published
this
rate
of
$5.11
which
equals
the
charge
of
the
competing
barge-truck
group
just
equal,
it
doesn't
undercut
it.
this
rate
is
a
very
typical
rate.
it's
a
rate
of
which
there
is
literally
thousand
of
this
type
of
rates
maintained
not
only
by
the
railroad
but
by
the
truck
lines
and
by
the
barge
lines.
that
is
a
rate
which
in
response
to
competitive
situations
is
reduced
below
the
so-called
fully
distributed
level
but
which
is
above
the
out-of-pocket
cost
level
and
therefore
produces
either
you
want
to
call
it
a
contribution
to
the
railroad
constant
expenses
which
are
the
expenses
which
aren't
incurred
in
the
rendition
of
this
traffic
or
it
produces
the
problem.
the
two
things
there
are
anomalous.
i
might
say
that
if
the
barge
lines
in
this
case
had
not
argued
that
this
particular
rate
interfered
with
their
inherent
advantage,
the
commission
would
have
approved
this
rate.
it
regularly,
everyday
approved
rates
of
this
type.
in
every
instance
and
virtually
every
instance
where
competitive
rates
are
before
the
commission
and
they
are
bound
to
be
compensatory
and
as
this
rate
was
beneficial
to
the
proponent
carriers
on
revenue
requirement.
the
commission
upon
those
showing
will
approve
the
rate
so
that
in
this
instance
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
we
say
that
the
principles
that
we
advocated
here
and
which
we're
bound
to
be
consistent
with
the
legislative
history
of
section
15a(3)
and
the
national
transportation
policy
should
govern
all
intermodal
competitive
rate
situation.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
no.
we're
not
basing
our
argument
on
the
fact
that
this
is
a
relatively
insignificant
type
of
traffic
but
i
did
want
to
put
it
in
the
right
prospective
there.
the
commission
could
not
have
made
any
finding
that
taking
this
traffic
from
this
very
prosperous
and
vigorous
barge
carrier
would
have
driven
the
amount
of
business.
they
just
couldn't
make
that
kind
of
a
finding
but
every
piece
of
traffic
that
we
seek,
every
piece
of
traffic
that
were
in
a
competitive
market
for
we
regard
it
but
you
don't
want
to
upgrade
before
it
into
the
railroad
industry.
half
that's
we
make
on
this
type
of
business
in
totality
which
enable
the
railroads
to
either
meet
their
constant
expenses
or
to
approximately.
now,
our
position
as
i
say
here
is
that
what
the
commission
has
done
in
this
instance
and
bear
in
mind
what
they've
done
here.
they
have
fixed
as
the
floor
for
railroad
pricing,
not
railroad
cost,
nothing
related
to
the
railroad
transportation
carriage
of
this
but
the
fully
distributed
cost
level
of
the
competing
mode
namely
this
barge-truck
group.
the
lawfulness
of
our
rate,
the
rail
rate
is
being
judged
not
by
the
characteristics
of
our
business
and
not
by
our
cost
but
by
the
cost
of
another
competing
mode.
now,
when
this
matter
came
before
the
lower
court,
the
lower
court
made
a
very
exhaustive
review
of
the
legislative
history
not
only
of
section
15a(3)
which
is
the
controlling
statutory
standard
but
judging
the
awfulness
of
these
reduced
intermodal
competitive
rate
but
also
and
perhaps
more
importantly
of
the
national
transportation
policy
itself.
i
would
remind
perhaps
mr.
justice
fortas
that
in
response
to
the
questions
he
has
been
asking
that
section
15a(3)
does
not
order
the
commission
merely
to
judge
the
lawfulness
of
these
reduce
rates
by
the
national
transportation
policy
but
contains
other
specific
standards.
for
example,
if
you
would
turn
to
page
34
of
the
appendix,
the
controlling
statutory
standards
in
section
15a(3)
which
is
the
standard
that
apply
to
this
type
of
reduced
intermodal
competitive
rate
making
is
the
first
one,
the
commission
in
determining
whether
a
rate
is
valid
than
a
reasonable
minimum
rate
shall
consider
the
facts
and
circumstances
attending
the
movement
of
traffic
by
the
carrier
or
carriers
to
which
the
rate
is
applicable.
now,
that
standard
says
that
the
commission
in
judging
the
lawfulness
of
this
rate
should
do
so
in
respect
to
the
characteristics
of
rail
movement
and
the
cost
of
the
rail
movement
not
the
cost
of
the
competing
barge
lines
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
rates
of
a
carrier
shall
not
be
held
up
to
a
particular
level
to
protect
the
traffic
of
any
other
mode
of
transportation
giving
due
consideration
to
the
objectives
in
multiple
not
the
single
objective.
the
objectives
of
the
national
transportation
policy
declared
in
this
act.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
the
rate
of
$5.11.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
no,
but
they
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
their
cost
in
this
case
of
performing
this
--
yes
sir.
the
cost
on
this
case
of
performing
this
service
was
$4.70
a
ton.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
because
the
uncontroverted
testimony
in
this
case
was
if
the
railroad
were
to
effectively
compete
with
this
particular
piece
of
businesses,
ingot
mold
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
we
would
have
to
have
a
rate
of
$5.11
which
would
equal
the
charge
being
made
by
the
competitive
barge-truck
service.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
i'm
saying
we
could
sir
but
i'm
saying
that
in
this
instance,
the
testimony
of
the
shipper
and
we
believe
the
shipper
and
the
commission
have
no
reason
not
to
believe
it
was
that
if
the
railroad
were
to
have
an
opportunity
to
compete
for
this
traffic,
they
had
to
have
devices
equal
to
those
of
the
competing
barge-truck
group
and
we
did
published
that
rate
and
we've
gotten
some
of
the
business.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
no
sir,
it
wouldn't
but
he
said
that
that
was
the
rate
we
would
have
to
maintain
and
there
was
no
advantage
to
us
to
go
any
lower
because
we
would
get
less
return
above
our
out-of-pocket
cost.
by
the
way,
i
might
point
out
that
this
out-of-pocket
cost
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
yes
sir.
it
would
be
profitable
because
it
would
make
some
contribution
to
the
cost
and
expenses
which
we
were
not
then
getting.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
sir,
they're
not
paying
it
because
nobody
is
making
this
contribution
until
you
get
this
particular
piece
of
traffic.
when
you
get
it,
you
get
the
contribution
and
that
goes
towards
the
railroad's
cost
and
expense.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
sir?
no
sir.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
no
sir.
i
might
say
that
that
is
not
the
fact.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
we
are
making
a
profit
sir
but
most
of
the
railroads
in
the
country
do
not
cover
their
fully
distributed
cost.
let
me
just
say
this
for
example
to
make
this
clear
to
you.
since
1958
when
section
15a(3)
was
enacted.
the
railroads
have
reduced
their
rates
13.5%
across
the
board.
now,
that
means
that's
in
the
face
of
generally
rising
cost.
now,
notwithstanding
that
fact
and
they
have
improved
their
overall
situation
very
greatly.
now,
the
reason
they
done
that
is
that
they
now
have
a
competitive
pricing
structure.
they
are
in
a
position
by
maintaining
lower
prices
to
attract
business
and
therefore
more
nearly
cover
their
constant
expenses.
if
we
are
precluded
from
maintaining
this
rate
far
from
enabling
as
to
recover
our
constant
expenses,
we
don't
get
them
on
this
particular
business.
if
we
don't
get
them
on
a
whole
lot
of
other
pieces
of
business
like
this,
we
do
not
make
our
constant
expenses.
now,
that's
the
reality
to
the
situation
in
order
to
improve
our
situation,
we
have
to
put
in
competitive
prices,
price
which
would
bring
the
business
to
us
and
make
some
contribution
toward
the
costs
and
expenses.
now,
i
would
in
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
because
it's
well
established
by
the
case
in
this
court
by
cases
in
all
the
district
court
and
by
long
line
of
cases
which
nobody
require
with
before
the
commission
that
if
we
publish
a
rate
below
the
expenses
which
we
incur
in
providing
the
service,
i.e.
the
out-of-pocket
cost
that
that
rate
is
non-compensatory
and
unlawful.
it
then
violates
in
the
national
transportation
policy.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
it
hasn't
anything
to
do
with
the
barges
but
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
wrong
in
any
instance
but
the
barge
line
which
would
be
the
normal
situation
to
come
in
here
and
complain
before
the
commission
that
that
is
an
unlawful
rate
because
it
is
below
the
railroad
expenses
that
are
incurred
in
providing
the
service
which
is
being
priced
and
that
would
be
found
unlawful.
that's
the
normal
situation.
it
happen
everyday
before
the
commission.
i'm
running
a
little
short
of
time
but
i
would
like
to
just
say
something
about
the
legislative
history
of
this
section.
particularly
with
respect
to
the
requirement
that
the
commission
recognized
and
preserves
inherent
advantages,
this
requirement
came
into
law,
and
in
1935,
a
part
of
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1935
and
it
came
in
at
the
insistence
of
the
motor
carrier
industry.
now,
the
reason
they
insisted
upon
this,
they
were
afraid
that
the
commission
would
require
the
motor
carrier
to
raise
their
rates
in
order
to
protect
the
railroad.
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
that
what
the
motor
carriers
insisted
upon
was
the
right
to
have
their
rate
reflects
their
own
cost
characteristics.
now,
in
1940
when
the
congress
had
before
the
transportation
act
of
1940
which
brought
on
the
regulation
the
water
carrier
industry,
the
water
carrier
made
the
same
demand.
they
insisted
that
if
they
were
going
to
be
brought
on
the
regulation
that
the
commission
in
judging
the
lawfulness
of
their
rate
do
it
with
respect
to
their
own
cost
considerations
and
not
the
cost
considerations
of
the
railroad
and
in
1958
when
the
section
15a(3)
was
before
the
congress,
senator
smathers,
senator
wheeler
to
come
and
testify
into
what
was
the
intent
and
purpose
of
the
national
transportation
policy
with
respect
to
the
preservation
of
inherent
advantages
and
senator
wheeler
said
that
the
purpose
was
to
just
as
i
have
stated.
to
make
certain
that
the
commission
in
judging
the
lawfulness
of
rates
of
any
mode
would
do
so
with
respect
to
that
mode's
cost
--
own
cost
characteristics
and
not
the
characteristics
of
another
mode.
and
during
our
colloquy
with
senator
schoeppel
who
--
senator
wheeler
made
the
statement
in
this
part,
senator
schoeppel
said
this.
?of
course
all
of
that
was
tied
to
one
cord
of
factor
namely
that
those
rates
when
they
were
established
would
be
compensatory
was
it
not,
talking
about
the
preservation
of
inherent
advantage.
and
mr.
wheeler
who
had
managed
the
1940
act
in
the
motor
carrier
act
said,
to
be
part
in
this
matter
exactly,
as
long
as
they
were
compensatory
then
they
could
reduce
the
rate.
the
water
carrier
could
reduce
their
rate
as
long
as
they
were
compensatory
to
take
business
of
way
or
the
motor
carriers
could
reduce
their
rates
to
a
compensatory
level
to
take
business
away
from
the
railroad
and
the
railroad
could
reduce
their
rate
to
meet
competition
so
long
as
they
are
compensatory.
now,
it
was
in
view
of
that
legislative
history
that
the
lower
court
found
that
normally,
the
commission
should
approve
rate
when
it
binds
their
compensatory.
and
that
in
this
case
since
they
have
found
they
were
compensatory
and
beneficial
to
the
railroad
own
revenue
requirement,
they
should
have
approved
them
but
if
they
weren't
going
to
approve
them,
they
had
a
very
heavy
obligation
to
show
why
they
were
taking
it
diametrically
opposite
approach.
that
is
approach
inconsistent
with
the
legislative
history
of
section
15a(3).
i
would
--
if
i
had
the
time,
i
would
point
out
that
the
lower
court
made
a
great
reference
to
the
new
automobiles
case
and
said
that
that
case
in
which
the
commission
had
dealt
with
the
1940
act
provided
the
proper
philosophy
to
be
applied
in
this
situation
but
the
commission
had
not
followed
it.
they
didn't
follow
it
here.
and
therefore,
the
lower
court
quite
properly
concluded
that
what
the
commission
had
done
here
was
inconsistent
with
the
legislative
history
and
the
intent
of
congress
that
carriers
and
this
intermodal
situation
should
be
normally
free
to
reduce
their
rates
provided
their
compensatory
and
provided
they're
not
detrimental
to
the
carrier's
own
requirements
and
in
doing
that,
the
lower
court
was
echoing
precisely
what
this
court
had
said
in
new
haven.
and
this
court
in
new
haven
as
the
court
will
remember
said
that
carriers
should
not
be
prohibited
from
reducing
a
rate
which
is
compensatory
and
which
is
not
detrimental
to
its
own
requirements
merely
because
such
a
rate
would
have
divert
traffic
from
the
competitive
mode.
and
that
court
went
on
to
say
that
this
applied
even
though
it
would
take
all
of
the
traffic
from
another
mode
and
even
though
it
would
destroy
the
other
mode
so
that
the
impact
of
this
rate
on
the
barge
line
would
have
no
concern
to
the
commission
under
both
the
new
haven
doctrine
and
under
the
legislative
history
of
the
applicable
section
and
i
see
it
that
i'll
close
on
that
note.
i
would
invite
attention
--
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
have
detailed
in
our
brief
the
legislative
history
of
the
applicable
standard.
i
would
mention
to
mr.
justice
white
that
the
report
of
the
accounts
of
economic
advisors
is
quoted
in
part
to
page
36
of
our
brief
in
footnote
78.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
court.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
i'm
appearing
here
today
on
behalf
of
the
railroad
appellees
both
the
principal
appellees
which
included
the
railroads
that
published
this
rate
mainly
the
what
have
now
the
penn
central
company
and
the
louisville
and
nashville
railroad
and
also
for
the
large
group
of
railroads
that
intervened
in
the
proceedings
below
in
support
of
the
principal
railroad
appellant
in
that
case.
i
would
say
at
the
outset
that
our
position
here
is
the
same
as
the
position
that
--
which
mr.
friedman
has
advanced
for
the
united
states
government
and
it's
the
same
position
that
the
antitrust
division
of
the
department
of
justice
took
in
the
court
below.
i
think
it
might
be
well
to
emphasize
at
the
outset
one
of
the
points
that
mr.
friedman
touched
upon.
this
particular
ingot
mold
rate
involves
a
very
small
amount
of
traffic
some
4,000
tons
of
business
a
year
moving
in
barges
or
in
rail
cart
and
600-ton
shipment
about
eight
or
ten
shipments
a
year.
this
rate
which
the
railroad
published
this
rate
of
$5.11
which
equals
the
charge
of
the
competing
barge-truck
group
just
equal,
it
doesn't
undercut
it.
this
rate
is
a
very
typical
rate.
it's
a
rate
of
which
there
is
literally
thousand
of
this
type
of
rates
maintained
not
only
by
the
railroad
but
by
the
truck
lines
and
by
the
barge
lines.
that
is
a
rate
which
in
response
to
competitive
situations
is
reduced
below
the
so-called
fully
distributed
level
but
which
is
above
the
out-of-pocket
cost
level
and
therefore
produces
either
you
want
to
call
it
a
contribution
to
the
railroad
constant
expenses
which
are
the
expenses
which
aren't
incurred
in
the
rendition
of
this
traffic
or
it
produces
the
problem.
the
two
things
there
are
anomalous.
i
might
say
that
if
the
barge
lines
in
this
case
had
not
argued
that
this
particular
rate
interfered
with
their
inherent
advantage,
the
commission
would
have
approved
this
rate.
it
regularly,
everyday
approved
rates
of
this
type.
in
every
instance
and
virtually
every
instance
where
competitive
rates
are
before
the
commission
and
they
are
bound
to
be
compensatory
and
as
this
rate
was
beneficial
to
the
proponent
carriers
on
revenue
requirement.
the
commission
upon
those
showing
will
approve
the
rate
so
that
in
this
instance
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
we
say
that
the
principles
that
we
advocated
here
and
which
we're
bound
to
be
consistent
with
the
legislative
history
of
section
15a(3)
and
the
national
transportation
policy
should
govern
all
intermodal
competitive
rate
situation.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
no.
we're
not
basing
our
argument
on
the
fact
that
this
is
a
relatively
insignificant
type
of
traffic
but
i
did
want
to
put
it
in
the
right
prospective
there.
the
commission
could
not
have
made
any
finding
that
taking
this
traffic
from
this
very
prosperous
and
vigorous
barge
carrier
would
have
driven
the
amount
of
business.
they
just
couldn't
make
that
kind
of
a
finding
but
every
piece
of
traffic
that
we
seek,
every
piece
of
traffic
that
were
in
a
competitive
market
for
we
regard
it
but
you
don't
want
to
upgrade
before
it
into
the
railroad
industry.
half
that's
we
make
on
this
type
of
business
in
totality
which
enable
the
railroads
to
either
meet
their
constant
expenses
or
to
approximately.
now,
our
position
as
i
say
here
is
that
what
the
commission
has
done
in
this
instance
and
bear
in
mind
what
they've
done
here.
they
have
fixed
as
the
floor
for
railroad
pricing,
not
railroad
cost,
nothing
related
to
the
railroad
transportation
carriage
of
this
but
the
fully
distributed
cost
level
of
the
competing
mode
namely
this
barge-truck
group.
the
lawfulness
of
our
rate,
the
rail
rate
is
being
judged
not
by
the
characteristics
of
our
business
and
not
by
our
cost
but
by
the
cost
of
another
competing
mode.
now,
when
this
matter
came
before
the
lower
court,
the
lower
court
made
a
very
exhaustive
review
of
the
legislative
history
not
only
of
section
15a(3)
which
is
the
controlling
statutory
standard
but
judging
the
awfulness
of
these
reduced
intermodal
competitive
rate
but
also
and
perhaps
more
importantly
of
the
national
transportation
policy
itself.
i
would
remind
perhaps
mr.
justice
fortas
that
in
response
to
the
questions
he
has
been
asking
that
section
15a(3)
does
not
order
the
commission
merely
to
judge
the
lawfulness
of
these
reduce
rates
by
the
national
transportation
policy
but
contains
other
specific
standards.
for
example,
if
you
would
turn
to
page
34
of
the
appendix,
the
controlling
statutory
standards
in
section
15a(3)
which
is
the
standard
that
apply
to
this
type
of
reduced
intermodal
competitive
rate
making
is
the
first
one,
the
commission
in
determining
whether
a
rate
is
valid
than
a
reasonable
minimum
rate
shall
consider
the
facts
and
circumstances
attending
the
movement
of
traffic
by
the
carrier
or
carriers
to
which
the
rate
is
applicable.
now,
that
standard
says
that
the
commission
in
judging
the
lawfulness
of
this
rate
should
do
so
in
respect
to
the
characteristics
of
rail
movement
and
the
cost
of
the
rail
movement
not
the
cost
of
the
competing
barge
lines
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
rates
of
a
carrier
shall
not
be
held
up
to
a
particular
level
to
protect
the
traffic
of
any
other
mode
of
transportation
giving
due
consideration
to
the
objectives
in
multiple
not
the
single
objective.
the
objectives
of
the
national
transportation
policy
declared
in
this
act.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
the
rate
of
$5.11.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
no,
but
they
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
their
cost
in
this
case
of
performing
this
--
yes
sir.
the
cost
on
this
case
of
performing
this
service
was
$4.70
a
ton.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
because
the
uncontroverted
testimony
in
this
case
was
if
the
railroad
were
to
effectively
compete
with
this
particular
piece
of
businesses,
ingot
mold
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
we
would
have
to
have
a
rate
of
$5.11
which
would
equal
the
charge
being
made
by
the
competitive
barge-truck
service.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
i'm
saying
we
could
sir
but
i'm
saying
that
in
this
instance,
the
testimony
of
the
shipper
and
we
believe
the
shipper
and
the
commission
have
no
reason
not
to
believe
it
was
that
if
the
railroad
were
to
have
an
opportunity
to
compete
for
this
traffic,
they
had
to
have
devices
equal
to
those
of
the
competing
barge-truck
group
and
we
did
published
that
rate
and
we've
gotten
some
of
the
business.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
no
sir,
it
wouldn't
but
he
said
that
that
was
the
rate
we
would
have
to
maintain
and
there
was
no
advantage
to
us
to
go
any
lower
because
we
would
get
less
return
above
our
out-of-pocket
cost.
by
the
way,
i
might
point
out
that
this
out-of-pocket
cost
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
yes
sir.
it
would
be
profitable
because
it
would
make
some
contribution
to
the
cost
and
expenses
which
we
were
not
then
getting.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
sir,
they're
not
paying
it
because
nobody
is
making
this
contribution
until
you
get
this
particular
piece
of
traffic.
when
you
get
it,
you
get
the
contribution
and
that
goes
towards
the
railroad's
cost
and
expense.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
sir?
no
sir.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
no
sir.
i
might
say
that
that
is
not
the
fact.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
we
are
making
a
profit
sir
but
most
of
the
railroads
in
the
country
do
not
cover
their
fully
distributed
cost.
let
me
just
say
this
for
example
to
make
this
clear
to
you.
since
1958
when
section
15a(3)
was
enacted.
the
railroads
have
reduced
their
rates
13.5%
across
the
board.
now,
that
means
that's
in
the
face
of
generally
rising
cost.
now,
notwithstanding
that
fact
and
they
have
improved
their
overall
situation
very
greatly.
now,
the
reason
they
done
that
is
that
they
now
have
a
competitive
pricing
structure.
they
are
in
a
position
by
maintaining
lower
prices
to
attract
business
and
therefore
more
nearly
cover
their
constant
expenses.
if
we
are
precluded
from
maintaining
this
rate
far
from
enabling
as
to
recover
our
constant
expenses,
we
don't
get
them
on
this
particular
business.
if
we
don't
get
them
on
a
whole
lot
of
other
pieces
of
business
like
this,
we
do
not
make
our
constant
expenses.
now,
that's
the
reality
to
the
situation
in
order
to
improve
our
situation,
we
have
to
put
in
competitive
prices,
price
which
would
bring
the
business
to
us
and
make
some
contribution
toward
the
costs
and
expenses.
now,
i
would
in
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
because
it's
well
established
by
the
case
in
this
court
by
cases
in
all
the
district
court
and
by
long
line
of
cases
which
nobody
require
with
before
the
commission
that
if
we
publish
a
rate
below
the
expenses
which
we
incur
in
providing
the
service,
i.e.
the
out-of-pocket
cost
that
that
rate
is
non-compensatory
and
unlawful.
it
then
violates
in
the
national
transportation
policy.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
it
hasn't
anything
to
do
with
the
barges
but
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
wrong
in
any
instance
but
the
barge
line
which
would
be
the
normal
situation
to
come
in
here
and
complain
before
the
commission
that
that
is
an
unlawful
rate
because
it
is
below
the
railroad
expenses
that
are
incurred
in
providing
the
service
which
is
being
priced
and
that
would
be
found
unlawful.
that's
the
normal
situation.
it
happen
everyday
before
the
commission.
i'm
running
a
little
short
of
time
but
i
would
like
to
just
say
something
about
the
legislative
history
of
this
section.
particularly
with
respect
to
the
requirement
that
the
commission
recognized
and
preserves
inherent
advantages,
this
requirement
came
into
law,
and
in
1935,
a
part
of
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1935
and
it
came
in
at
the
insistence
of
the
motor
carrier
industry.
now,
the
reason
they
insisted
upon
this,
they
were
afraid
that
the
commission
would
require
the
motor
carrier
to
raise
their
rates
in
order
to
protect
the
railroad.
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
that
what
the
motor
carriers
insisted
upon
was
the
right
to
have
their
rate
reflects
their
own
cost
characteristics.
now,
in
1940
when
the
congress
had
before
the
transportation
act
of
1940
which
brought
on
the
regulation
the
water
carrier
industry,
the
water
carrier
made
the
same
demand.
they
insisted
that
if
they
were
going
to
be
brought
on
the
regulation
that
the
commission
in
judging
the
lawfulness
of
their
rate
do
it
with
respect
to
their
own
cost
considerations
and
not
the
cost
considerations
of
the
railroad
and
in
1958
when
the
section
15a(3)
was
before
the
congress,
senator
smathers,
senator
wheeler
to
come
and
testify
into
what
was
the
intent
and
purpose
of
the
national
transportation
policy
with
respect
to
the
preservation
of
inherent
advantages
and
senator
wheeler
said
that
the
purpose
was
to
just
as
i
have
stated.
to
make
certain
that
the
commission
in
judging
the
lawfulness
of
rates
of
any
mode
would
do
so
with
respect
to
that
mode's
cost
--
own
cost
characteristics
and
not
the
characteristics
of
another
mode.
and
during
our
colloquy
with
senator
schoeppel
who
--
senator
wheeler
made
the
statement
in
this
part,
senator
schoeppel
said
this.
?of
course
all
of
that
was
tied
to
one
cord
of
factor
namely
that
those
rates
when
they
were
established
would
be
compensatory
was
it
not,
talking
about
the
preservation
of
inherent
advantage.
and
mr.
wheeler
who
had
managed
the
1940
act
in
the
motor
carrier
act
said,
to
be
part
in
this
matter
exactly,
as
long
as
they
were
compensatory
then
they
could
reduce
the
rate.
the
water
carrier
could
reduce
their
rate
as
long
as
they
were
compensatory
to
take
business
of
way
or
the
motor
carriers
could
reduce
their
rates
to
a
compensatory
level
to
take
business
away
from
the
railroad
and
the
railroad
could
reduce
their
rate
to
meet
competition
so
long
as
they
are
compensatory.
now,
it
was
in
view
of
that
legislative
history
that
the
lower
court
found
that
normally,
the
commission
should
approve
rate
when
it
binds
their
compensatory.
and
that
in
this
case
since
they
have
found
they
were
compensatory
and
beneficial
to
the
railroad
own
revenue
requirement,
they
should
have
approved
them
but
if
they
weren't
going
to
approve
them,
they
had
a
very
heavy
obligation
to
show
why
they
were
taking
it
diametrically
opposite
approach.
that
is
approach
inconsistent
with
the
legislative
history
of
section
15a(3).
i
would
--
if
i
had
the
time,
i
would
point
out
that
the
lower
court
made
a
great
reference
to
the
new
automobiles
case
and
said
that
that
case
in
which
the
commission
had
dealt
with
the
1940
act
provided
the
proper
philosophy
to
be
applied
in
this
situation
but
the
commission
had
not
followed
it.
they
didn't
follow
it
here.
and
therefore,
the
lower
court
quite
properly
concluded
that
what
the
commission
had
done
here
was
inconsistent
with
the
legislative
history
and
the
intent
of
congress
that
carriers
and
this
intermodal
situation
should
be
normally
free
to
reduce
their
rates
provided
their
compensatory
and
provided
they're
not
detrimental
to
the
carrier's
own
requirements
and
in
doing
that,
the
lower
court
was
echoing
precisely
what
this
court
had
said
in
new
haven.
and
this
court
in
new
haven
as
the
court
will
remember
said
that
carriers
should
not
be
prohibited
from
reducing
a
rate
which
is
compensatory
and
which
is
not
detrimental
to
its
own
requirements
merely
because
such
a
rate
would
have
divert
traffic
from
the
competitive
mode.
and
that
court
went
on
to
say
that
this
applied
even
though
it
would
take
all
of
the
traffic
from
another
mode
and
even
though
it
would
destroy
the
other
mode
so
that
the
impact
of
this
rate
on
the
barge
line
would
have
no
concern
to
the
commission
under
both
the
new
haven
doctrine
and
under
the
legislative
history
of
the
applicable
section
and
i
see
it
that
i'll
close
on
that
note.
i
would
invite
attention
--
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
have
detailed
in
our
brief
the
legislative
history
of
the
applicable
standard.
i
would
mention
to
mr.
justice
white
that
the
report
of
the
accounts
of
economic
advisors
is
quoted
in
part
to
page
36
of
our
brief
in
footnote
78.
