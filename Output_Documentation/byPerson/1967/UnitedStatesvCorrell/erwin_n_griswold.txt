mr.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
tax
case
involving
a
rather
narrow
question
of
statutory
construction
with
respect
to
a
matter
as
to
which
there
is
very
little
specific
in
the
statute.
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
essentially
a
question
of
tax
administration.
the
statutory
provisions
which
are
involved,
there
are
two.
they
are
set
forth
at
the
bottom
of
page
2
of
the
government's
main
brief,
section
162
of
the
internal
revenue
code
allows
the
taxpayer
to
deduct
the
necessary
expenses
of
carrying
on
a
trade
or
business
including,
and
these
are
the
words;
traveling
expenses
including
the
entire
amount
spent
for
meals
and
lodging
while
away
from
home
in
the
pursuit
of
a
trade
or
business.
and
if
that
statutory
provision
was
the
only
one
there
was,
i
suppose
this
problem
would
not
be
here.
there
is
however
another
section
of
the
statute,
a
section
which
i
may
say
was
not
mentioned
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
at
section
262
which
provides
except
as
otherwise
expressly
provided
in
this
chapter.
no
deduction
shall
be
allowed
for
a
personal
living
or
family
expenses.
the
question
arises
on
these
facts.
the
taxpayer
is
a
salesman
whose
home
is
in
fountain
city,
tennessee,
which
i
understand
to
be
a
suburb
of
knoxville.
he
is
one
of
some
16-group
salesmen
who
works
for
a
wholesale
grocery
company
named
hale
brothers
incorporated
which
has
its
headquarters
in
morristown,
tennessee,
which
is
about
50
miles
away
from
fountain
city.
each
salesman
has
a
territory.
one
or
two
have
accounts
only
in
their
own
hometowns.
some
others
have
larger
territories
and
make
at
least
occasional
overnight
trips.
but
the
taxpayer
in
this
case
left
home
each
morning
about
4:30
or
5:00
in
the
morning,
made
calls
in
several
cities
and
towns
and
returned
home
between
4:30
and
5:00
in
the
afternoon.
and
the
simple
question
in
this
case
is
whether
this
taxpayer
is
entitled
to
deduct
in
computing
his
taxable
income,
the
cost
of
his
two
meals
during
that
day,
breakfast
and
lunch,
which
he
usually
had
on
the
premises
of
his
customers
at
places
known
to
his
employer
so
that
his
employer
would
be
able
to
get
in
touch
with
him
if
there
was
any
matter
that
he
wanted
to
communicate
to
him.
i
think
i
should
also
mention
that
there
is
pending
before
the
court
another
case,
the
william
a.
bagley
against
the
united
states,
against
the
commissioner,
number
155,
in
which
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
has
been
applied
for
which
is
essentially
in
conflict
with
the
decision
below.
and
the
court
has
not
taken
action
on
that
petition.
mr.
griswold
that's
from
the
first
circuit
with
if
i
may
say
so
an
excellent
opinion
by
judge
aldrich
which
is
included
in
the
petition
in
that
case
and
that
which
seems
to
me
they
present
a
very
fine
analysis
of
the
problem.
the
bagley
case
is
similar
to
this
case.
it's
a
little
different
in
that
it
involves
the
free
meals
per
day
whereas
the
present
case
involves
the
two
meals
per
day.
in
the
bagley
case,
the
taxpayer
was
an
engineer
who
had
retired
from
a
job
at
general
electric
and
did
consulting
work.
he
kept
his
office
in
his
home.
he
was
a
widower,
lived
alone.
the
evidence
was
that
he
didn't
like
to
cook
or
wash
dishes.
he
left
home
in
the
morning
at
6
o'clock.
he
often
did
not
return
until
9:00
or
10:00
at
night.
sometimes
traveled
100
miles
during
the
day
and
took
three
meals;
breakfast,
lunch,
and
dinner.
all
of
which
he
sought
to
deduct
under
section
162
and
the
first
circuit
held
that
none
of
them
were
deductible
essentially
under
section
262.
the
statutory
provision
in
its
present
form
goes
back
to
1921.
the
earlier
statute
had
simply
allowed
the
deduction
of
business
expenses.
and
the
commissioner
had
first
ruled
that
this
allowed
the
deduction
of
travel
expenses
that
is
transportation
expenses
fares,
but
that
it
did
not
allowed
the
deduction
of
anything
for
meals
and
lodging,
that
that
was
barred
by
section
262
since
meals
in
particular
were
something
which
the
taxpayer
had
to
provide
for
himself
anyway
and
it
was
a
personal
living
or
family
expense.
later
under
that
statute
in
1920,
the
commissioner
put
out
a
new
regulation
in
which
he
said
that
the
taxpayer
could
deduct
the
additional
amount
which
he
was
required
to
expend
on
account
of
meals
and
lodging
over
and
above
what
he
would
have
had
to
expend
if
he
had
not
been
in
a
travel
status.
and
the
treasury
of
course
immediately
found
that
extremely
difficult
to
administer
because
it
was
terribly
hard
to
know
what
the
additional
amount
was.
some
people
might
live
rather
high
at
home
and
therefore
couldn't
deduct
very
much.
and
other
people
who
are
very
frugal
at
home
might
be
able
to
show
a
larger
deduction.
and
it
was
in
1921
that
dr.
t.s.
adams,
the
treasury's
expert
and
adviser,
appeared
before
congress
and
recommended
on
behalf
of
the
treasury,
the
statutory
provision
which
is
still
in
effect
in
essence
allowing
the
deduction
of
the
entire
amount
spent
for
meals
and
lodging
while
away
from
home
in
the
pursuit
of
the
trade
or
business.
curiously
enough,
the
particular
question
was
which
we
are
concerned
does
not
seem
to
have
a
reason
for
the
next
20
years
or
more.
i
suppose
that
was
because
of
high
exemptions
and
relatively
low
rates
which
were
involved
at
that
time.
however,
it
was
very
early
established
and
there
were
decisions
of
the
tax
court
in
1924.
the
first
--
the
very
first
volume
of
then
it
was
the
board
of
tax
appeals,
and
there
had
been
administrative
rulings
as
early
as
1919
that
the
commuter
could
not
deduct
his
meal
expenses.
and
there
where
even
some
cases
involving
two-meal
commuters,
that
is
the
businessman
or
the
lawyer
might
come
in
and
not
only
have
lunch
but
he
had
to
work
in
the
evening.
so
he
went
out
some
place
and
had
supper,
and
neither
the
lunch
nor
the
supper
was
allowed
as
a
deduction
although
i
would
point
out
that
it
could
at
least
in
some
sense
be
regarded
as
coming
within
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
which
allows
the
deduction
of
the
entire
amount
expended
for
meals
and
lodging
while
away
from
home
in
the
pursuit
of
a
trade
or
business.
now,
this
meant
that
very
early,
it
was
recognized
that
away
from
home,
was
an
illusive
verbal
construct
and
required
some
rather
careful
consideration.
as
early
as
1940,
the
treasury
ruled
in
effect
that
no
deduction
could
be
had
unless
the
taxpayer
was
required
to
be
a
way
long
enough
to
need
a
sleep
or
rest.
from
1944
to
1962,
there
were
more
than
a
dozen
cases
which
supported
what
is
sometimes
called
the
commissioner's
“overnight
rule”
where
he
tried
to
draw
the
line
by
saying
that
you
can't
deduct
meals
unless
you
are
away
overnight.
i
think
a
more
refined
version
of
it
is
to
call
it
the
sleep
or
rest
rule
because
cases
that
soon
arose
where
taxpayers
didn't
necessarily
sleep
at
night.
the
railroad
conductor
who
took
a
long
trip
and
took
a
room
for
rest
during
the
day
returning
on
an
evening
run,
the
commissioner
in
1940s
said
that
if
he
was
required
to
take
the
room,
that
he
could
deduct
not
only
the
cost
of
the
room
but
also
the
meals.
and
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
some
years
ago
held
that
whether
he
was
required
or
not,
if
the
length
of
the
trip
was
such
as
to
make
it
appropriate
for
him
to
seek
rest
in
the
course
of
the
journey,
he
could
deduct
not
only
the
cost
of
the
lodging
but
also
the
meals.
beginning
in
1948,
the
commissioner
made
this
very
specific
in
two
places,
actually
beginning
in
1946
which
is
21
years
ago.
and
for
the
convenience
of
the
court,
i
printed
the
text
of
this
in
the
reply
brief
which
has
been
filed
in
the
correll
case
on
page
11
of
the
reply
brief
are
set
out
the
instructions,
the
official
instructions
which
the
commissioner
has
used
with
respect
to
form
1040,
the
standard
taxpayer
return
form.
and
since
1948,
these
instructions
have
always
specified
as
indicated
that
near
at
the
top
of
page
11,
the
last
sentence
of
the
indented
quotation
traveling
“away
from
home”
means
going
away
from
the
city
or
town
where
you
normally
work
and
remaining
away
at
least
overnight.
and
you'll
find
that
phrase
at
least
overnight
in
all
the
rest
of
the
instructions
right
down
through
1966.
the
1967
instructions
i
believe
have
not
yet
appeared.
in
addition
the
commissioner
puts
out
a
booklet
called
“your
federal
income
tax,”
and
since
1946,
as
quoted
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
12,
this
booklet
has
specifically
referred
to
require
his
absence
overnight,
at
top
of
page
13
from
which
he
does
not
return
the
same
day.
the
1955
edition
is
quoted
at
the
bottom
of
page
13
in
the
last
full
line
and
remaining
away
at
least
overnight.
you
then
find
some
modification
beginning
in
the
59
and
the
63
editions
where
there
is
a
reference
to
necessitate
relief
from
duty
to
obtain
sleep
or
to
obtain
necessary
sleep
showing
the
transition
to
the
sleep
or
rest
rule
which
seems
to
me
to
be
inappropriate
and
thoroughly
sound
than
refinement
of
the
originally
stated
overnight
rule.
in
1954,
the
internal
revenue
code
was
given
a
comprehensive
revision.
and
there
was
some
reference
to
this
problem
in
three
situations.
in
the
first
place
at
the
hearings,
a
taxpayer
appeared
objected
to
the
overnight
rule
and
set
it
out
to
be
changed.
no
change
was
made.
i
don't
put
great
significance
in
that.
i
simply
record
it
as
one
of
the
facts.
two
amendments
were
made
to
the
statute
in
1954.
one
was
the
enactment
of
a
section
120
which
specifically
allowed
a
state
policeman
to
deduct
an
amount
of
$5.00
a
day
and
in
the
provision
which
is
sent
then
repealed
by
congress
because
it
was
found
impossible
to
justify
this
special
deduction
for
state
policemen
when
such
a
deduction
was
not
available
for
others.
but
in
the
committee
report
with
respect
to
that,
congress
referred
specifically
to
the
fact
that
the
application
of
the
statute
at
that
time
allowed
for
the
deduction
for
meals
while
away
from
home
overnight.
mr.
griswold
that
is
on
the
--
this
is
on
pages
17
and
18,
and
the
exact
quotation
from
the
committee
report
is
on
page
18
about
three
inches
from
the
top
of
the
page
for
meals
while
away
from
home
overnight,
the
overnight
is
printed
in
italics
in
the
brief
and
those
are
italics,
the
committee
report
is
simply
printed
in
ordinary
type.
there
was
also
another
provision
in
1954.
this
problem
arises
not
only
with
respect
to
the
deduction
in
section
162,
but
in
a
somewhat
mildly
complicated
way
with
respect
to
the
determination
of
adjusted
gross
income
which
for
practical
purposes
means
whether
you
can
get
the
deduction
and
also
take
the
standard
deduction
of
10%
of
your
income.
and
until
1954,
because
of
the
way
the
statute
was
worded,
there
was
a
difference
wholly
unjustified
between
the
taxpayer
who
paid
his
own
travel
expenses
and
the
taxpayer
who
was
reimbursed
by
his
employer
with
respect
to
the
travel
expenses.
when
congress
straightened
that
out
in
1954
by
an
amendment
to
section
622
(c)
and
again,
the
committee
report
expressly
refers
to
the
fact
that
the
commissioner's
rule
is
away
from
home
overnight.
now
there
was
no
official
dissent
from
that
view
until
1962
when
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeal
decided
a
case
called
hanson.
there
was
an
earlier
case
in
the
first
circuit
which
uses
a
language
to
the
effect
that
the
commissioner's
construction
of
the
statute
is
something
that
he
dreamed
up
but
actually
the
first
circuit
case
involved
a
railroad
conductor
who
took
a
long
trip
to
a
distant
place,
took
a
room
for
sleep
or
rest,
and
came
back.
and
as
i've
indicated
the
commissioner
has
long
since
accepted
that
goes
on
the
overnight
rule.
but
it
was
the
hanson
case
in
the
eighth
circuit
which
first
threw
uncertainty
into
that
picture.
i
may
mention
just
to
complete
the
statutory
history
that
in
1962,
section
162
was
amended
in
a
way
which
is
not
applicable
here
because
the
years
involved
here
are
1960
and
‘61
but
which
is
also
clearly
not
relevant
because
what
it
did
was
simply
to
limit
the
deduction
to
amounts
which
are
not
leverage
in
amount
and
there's
not
suggestion
that
anything
of
that
sort
was
involved.
finally
in
1963,
the
treasury
recommended
to
congress
that
the
statute
be
changed.
this
is
referred
to
on
pages
25
and
26
of
the
government's
brief.
the
treasury
suggested
that
the
deduction
be
allowed
where
there
was
an
absence
of
16
hours
or
more
and
where
substantial
arrest
was
needed
in
connection
with
the
travel.
it
also
suggested
that
there
be
a
duty
area
which
would
be
a
circle
of
20
miles
radius.
nothing
came
of
this
recommendation.
it
was
not
reported
out
of
the
committee
on
ways
and
means.
and
i
mentioned
that
simply
to
complete
the
story.
now,
one
can
look
at
this
statutory
language
and
try
to
search
out
the
“meaning
of
congress.”
and
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
a
rather
illusory
matter
because
i
find
it
difficult
to
find
any
evidence
that
congress
ever
thought
about
this
detailed
application
of
the
statutory
provision.
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
is
essentially
a
case
of
tax
administration.
that
congress
has
committed
the
administration
of
this
statute
to
the
treasury
has
authorized
the
commissioner
to
make
appropriate
rules
and
regulations
and
the
commissioner
has
made
such
rules
and
regulations.
they
might
may
or
may
not
be
the
same
as
a
court
would
make
as
an
original
proposition.
but
my
thought
would
be
that
unless
the
court
finds
that
this
is
an
unreasonable
or
wholly
inappropriate
construction
and
application
of
the
statute,
it
should
be
upheld.
there
are
two
problems,
or
there
is
a
problem
arising
from
the
application
of
these
two
statutory
provisions.
i
repeat,
if
there
was
section
162
alone,
i
wouldn't
doubt
that
these
meal
expenses
would
be
deductible.
if
there
was
section
262
alone,
no
deduction
allowed
for
personal
family
and
living
expenses
seems
to
me
equally
declare
that
the
meal
expenses
would
not
be
deductible.
what
you
actually
have
then
is
the
two
statutory
provisions;
both
obviously
intended
to
be
given
some
effect
by
congress.
and
the
problem
is
to
work
out
a
practical
administrable
way
to
give
appropriate
application
to
these
provisions
and
i
suggest
to
at
the
same
time,
to
provide
a
measure
of
equality
of
treatment
between
taxpayers
who
are
similarly
situated.
mr.
griswold
that
would
certainly
be
arguable
except
that
i
think
the
ground
upon
which
this
court
put
the
flowers
decision,
commissioner
against
flowers
which
was
to
the
effect
that
the
commuting
expenses
involved
there
arose
not
out
of
the
business,
but
out
of
his
personal
choice,
it
might
be
negative,
or
that
would
be
more
difficult
if
there
weren't
any
section
262.
mr.
griswold
sometimes
it
is
said
that
what
flowers
means
is
that
home
is
your
regular
place
of
the
business
which
it
gave
rise
to
the
quip
of
the
man
kissing
his
wife
goodbye
in
the
morning
and
saying
“goodbye
my
love,
i'm
going
home
to
work.
i'll
be
back
here
this
evening.”
obviously,
there
is
a
problem
of
construction
here.
i
think
everyone
has
agreed
that
the
commuter's
expenses
ought
not
to
be
deductible.
i
suppose
that
the
rest
under
section
262,
but
it
might
also
be
regarded
as
a
construction
of
all
the
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
of
carrying
on
the
trade
or
business.
the
commuter's
expenses
might
be
regarded
as
not
business
expenses
even
if
there
were
not
section
262.
mr.
griswold
well
that's
the
--
if
that
is
the
effect
which
is
to
be
given
to
flowers,
that
home
means
principal
place
of
business,
that
would
be
the
situation.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
rather
narrow
grounds
on
which
this
case
can
be
put.
one
is
suggested
by
judge
aldrich
in
the
bagley
opinion.
he
says
that
the
statute
refers
to
meals
and
lodging,
and
that
unless
there's
also
lodging
that
maybe
it
can
be
argued
that
there's
no
deduction
for
meals.
another
basis
of
dealing
with
the
problem
it
seems
to
me
would
distinguish
between
the
person
who
makes
an
occasional
or
sporadic
business
trip.
the
new
york
lawyer
who
has
a
case
before
this
court
comes
down
to
washington,
goes
back
the
same
evening
on
the
one
hand.
and
taxpayers
like
the
present
taxpayer
who
does
it
regularly
as
a
matter
of
course.
if
the
place
of
business,
if
home
is
the
place
of
business,
this
taxpayer
took
his
place
of
business
along
with
him.
among
other
things,
it's
a
little
hard
to
see
why
this
taxpayer
should
be
allowed
to
deduct
two
meals,
both
breakfast
and
lunch,
when
the
similar
situated
taxpayer,
indeed
some
of
his
fellow
employees
who
work
only
in
one
community,
are
not
allowed
to
deduct
either
meal
and
while
the
ordinary
taxpayer
can't
deduct
his
lunch
because
that
is
of
course
a
personal
family
or
living
expense.
the
suggestion
is
made
in
some
of
the
court
of
appeals
decisions
that
each
case
must
turn
on
its
own
facts
that
the
questions
must
come
up
before
the
courts
and
be
decided
case
by
case.
and
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
a
thoroughly
unsound
way
to
administer
a
tax
system.
here
we
have
a
homely
problem
arising
some
47
years
after
the
statute
was
enacted,
arising
after
some
20
years
in
which
it
was
uniformly
applied
in
decisions
sustained
by
the
courts,
the
problems
arise
only
because
the
courts
have
sought
to
move
into
a
problem
which
is
essentially
one
of
administration.
and
to
say
that
this
should
be
decided
in
each
case
by
courts
depending
upon
their
separate
facts
as
to
use
a
phrase
of
my
old
colleague
professor
tomas
reed
powell
to
introduce
a
chaos
of
independent
episodes
instead
of
something
approaching
an
orderly
system.
of
all
kinds
of
questions
that
could
arise,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
one
which
ought
to
be
capable
of
determination
in
an
orderly
way
that
revenue
agents
and
taxpayers
can
understand.
i
think
that
there
are
numerous
rules
which
might
be
applied
here
time
away,
distance
away,
and
so
on.
i
don't
see
that
anyone
of
them
is
any
better
than
the
rule
of
which
the
commissioner
has
devised
and
has
thought
to
apply
over
a
long
period
of
time.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
sound
and
wise
tax
and
judicial
administration
call
for
upholding
the
construction
adopted
by
the
commissioner.
mr.
griswold
there
is
no
doubt
that
under
this
rule,
the
line
is
drawn
at
overnight
or
a
sleep
or
rest.
there's
equally
no
doubt
that
there
will
be
cases
very
close
to
any
line
that
you
draw
which
make
those
cases
seemed
very
close
together.
our
position
is
that
there
is
a
difference.
there
is
a
point
where
a
substantial
additional
cost
is
likely
to
be
incurred
in
the
general
case
when
you
are
required
to
take
lodging
as
well
as
meals.
if
--
one
way
to
put
it
is
as
your
honor
did,
he
say
that
to
put
a
premium
on
staying
away
overnight.
indeed
in
this
very
case,
the
correll
case,
it
appeared
that
some
of
the
salesman
had
territories
under
which
they
did
from
time
to
time
stay
away
overnight.
and
their
entire
cost
of
meals
and
lodging
were
allowed
as
deductions.
similarly
in
the
bagley
case,
it
appeared
that
for
one
reason
or
another,
at
one
of
the
jobs
he
went
to
which
was
rather
closer
than
the
others,
or
from
30
miles
away.
he
did
as
a
matter
of
course,
stay
overnight
and
the
amount
of
his
meals
and
lodging
was
allowed
as
a
deduction.
i
wouldn't
say
that
it
could
have
premium
on
staying
away
overnight.
i
would
say
that
the
commissioner
has
thought
to
recognize
a
place
to
draw
the
line
where
there
is
in
the
general
case,
a
substantial
distinction.
and
that
staying
overnight
is
such
a
distinction.
mr.
griswold
the
commissioner's
overnight
rule?
no,
on
the
contrary
what
the
commissioner
did
in
1963
was
to
suggest
a
16-hour
rule
with
rest
required
together
with
a
20-mile
radius
around
the
post
of
duty.
and
nothing
fell
flatter
than
that.
mr.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
tax
case
involving
a
rather
narrow
question
of
statutory
construction
with
respect
to
a
matter
as
to
which
there
is
very
little
specific
in
the
statute.
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
essentially
a
question
of
tax
administration.
the
statutory
provisions
which
are
involved,
there
are
two.
they
are
set
forth
at
the
bottom
of
page
2
of
the
government's
main
brief,
section
162
of
the
internal
revenue
code
allows
the
taxpayer
to
deduct
the
necessary
expenses
of
carrying
on
a
trade
or
business
including,
and
these
are
the
words;
traveling
expenses
including
the
entire
amount
spent
for
meals
and
lodging
while
away
from
home
in
the
pursuit
of
a
trade
or
business.
and
if
that
statutory
provision
was
the
only
one
there
was,
i
suppose
this
problem
would
not
be
here.
there
is
however
another
section
of
the
statute,
a
section
which
i
may
say
was
not
mentioned
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
at
section
262
which
provides
except
as
otherwise
expressly
provided
in
this
chapter.
no
deduction
shall
be
allowed
for
a
personal
living
or
family
expenses.
the
question
arises
on
these
facts.
the
taxpayer
is
a
salesman
whose
home
is
in
fountain
city,
tennessee,
which
i
understand
to
be
a
suburb
of
knoxville.
he
is
one
of
some
16-group
salesmen
who
works
for
a
wholesale
grocery
company
named
hale
brothers
incorporated
which
has
its
headquarters
in
morristown,
tennessee,
which
is
about
50
miles
away
from
fountain
city.
each
salesman
has
a
territory.
one
or
two
have
accounts
only
in
their
own
hometowns.
some
others
have
larger
territories
and
make
at
least
occasional
overnight
trips.
but
the
taxpayer
in
this
case
left
home
each
morning
about
4:30
or
5:00
in
the
morning,
made
calls
in
several
cities
and
towns
and
returned
home
between
4:30
and
5:00
in
the
afternoon.
and
the
simple
question
in
this
case
is
whether
this
taxpayer
is
entitled
to
deduct
in
computing
his
taxable
income,
the
cost
of
his
two
meals
during
that
day,
breakfast
and
lunch,
which
he
usually
had
on
the
premises
of
his
customers
at
places
known
to
his
employer
so
that
his
employer
would
be
able
to
get
in
touch
with
him
if
there
was
any
matter
that
he
wanted
to
communicate
to
him.
i
think
i
should
also
mention
that
there
is
pending
before
the
court
another
case,
the
william
a.
bagley
against
the
united
states,
against
the
commissioner,
number
155,
in
which
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
has
been
applied
for
which
is
essentially
in
conflict
with
the
decision
below.
and
the
court
has
not
taken
action
on
that
petition.
mr.
griswold
that's
from
the
first
circuit
with
if
i
may
say
so
an
excellent
opinion
by
judge
aldrich
which
is
included
in
the
petition
in
that
case
and
that
which
seems
to
me
they
present
a
very
fine
analysis
of
the
problem.
the
bagley
case
is
similar
to
this
case.
it's
a
little
different
in
that
it
involves
the
free
meals
per
day
whereas
the
present
case
involves
the
two
meals
per
day.
in
the
bagley
case,
the
taxpayer
was
an
engineer
who
had
retired
from
a
job
at
general
electric
and
did
consulting
work.
he
kept
his
office
in
his
home.
he
was
a
widower,
lived
alone.
the
evidence
was
that
he
didn't
like
to
cook
or
wash
dishes.
he
left
home
in
the
morning
at
6
o'clock.
he
often
did
not
return
until
9:00
or
10:00
at
night.
sometimes
traveled
100
miles
during
the
day
and
took
three
meals;
breakfast,
lunch,
and
dinner.
all
of
which
he
sought
to
deduct
under
section
162
and
the
first
circuit
held
that
none
of
them
were
deductible
essentially
under
section
262.
the
statutory
provision
in
its
present
form
goes
back
to
1921.
the
earlier
statute
had
simply
allowed
the
deduction
of
business
expenses.
and
the
commissioner
had
first
ruled
that
this
allowed
the
deduction
of
travel
expenses
that
is
transportation
expenses
fares,
but
that
it
did
not
allowed
the
deduction
of
anything
for
meals
and
lodging,
that
that
was
barred
by
section
262
since
meals
in
particular
were
something
which
the
taxpayer
had
to
provide
for
himself
anyway
and
it
was
a
personal
living
or
family
expense.
later
under
that
statute
in
1920,
the
commissioner
put
out
a
new
regulation
in
which
he
said
that
the
taxpayer
could
deduct
the
additional
amount
which
he
was
required
to
expend
on
account
of
meals
and
lodging
over
and
above
what
he
would
have
had
to
expend
if
he
had
not
been
in
a
travel
status.
and
the
treasury
of
course
immediately
found
that
extremely
difficult
to
administer
because
it
was
terribly
hard
to
know
what
the
additional
amount
was.
some
people
might
live
rather
high
at
home
and
therefore
couldn't
deduct
very
much.
and
other
people
who
are
very
frugal
at
home
might
be
able
to
show
a
larger
deduction.
and
it
was
in
1921
that
dr.
t.s.
adams,
the
treasury's
expert
and
adviser,
appeared
before
congress
and
recommended
on
behalf
of
the
treasury,
the
statutory
provision
which
is
still
in
effect
in
essence
allowing
the
deduction
of
the
entire
amount
spent
for
meals
and
lodging
while
away
from
home
in
the
pursuit
of
the
trade
or
business.
curiously
enough,
the
particular
question
was
which
we
are
concerned
does
not
seem
to
have
a
reason
for
the
next
20
years
or
more.
i
suppose
that
was
because
of
high
exemptions
and
relatively
low
rates
which
were
involved
at
that
time.
however,
it
was
very
early
established
and
there
were
decisions
of
the
tax
court
in
1924.
the
first
--
the
very
first
volume
of
then
it
was
the
board
of
tax
appeals,
and
there
had
been
administrative
rulings
as
early
as
1919
that
the
commuter
could
not
deduct
his
meal
expenses.
and
there
where
even
some
cases
involving
two-meal
commuters,
that
is
the
businessman
or
the
lawyer
might
come
in
and
not
only
have
lunch
but
he
had
to
work
in
the
evening.
so
he
went
out
some
place
and
had
supper,
and
neither
the
lunch
nor
the
supper
was
allowed
as
a
deduction
although
i
would
point
out
that
it
could
at
least
in
some
sense
be
regarded
as
coming
within
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
which
allows
the
deduction
of
the
entire
amount
expended
for
meals
and
lodging
while
away
from
home
in
the
pursuit
of
a
trade
or
business.
now,
this
meant
that
very
early,
it
was
recognized
that
away
from
home,
was
an
illusive
verbal
construct
and
required
some
rather
careful
consideration.
as
early
as
1940,
the
treasury
ruled
in
effect
that
no
deduction
could
be
had
unless
the
taxpayer
was
required
to
be
a
way
long
enough
to
need
a
sleep
or
rest.
from
1944
to
1962,
there
were
more
than
a
dozen
cases
which
supported
what
is
sometimes
called
the
commissioner's
“overnight
rule”
where
he
tried
to
draw
the
line
by
saying
that
you
can't
deduct
meals
unless
you
are
away
overnight.
i
think
a
more
refined
version
of
it
is
to
call
it
the
sleep
or
rest
rule
because
cases
that
soon
arose
where
taxpayers
didn't
necessarily
sleep
at
night.
the
railroad
conductor
who
took
a
long
trip
and
took
a
room
for
rest
during
the
day
returning
on
an
evening
run,
the
commissioner
in
1940s
said
that
if
he
was
required
to
take
the
room,
that
he
could
deduct
not
only
the
cost
of
the
room
but
also
the
meals.
and
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
some
years
ago
held
that
whether
he
was
required
or
not,
if
the
length
of
the
trip
was
such
as
to
make
it
appropriate
for
him
to
seek
rest
in
the
course
of
the
journey,
he
could
deduct
not
only
the
cost
of
the
lodging
but
also
the
meals.
beginning
in
1948,
the
commissioner
made
this
very
specific
in
two
places,
actually
beginning
in
1946
which
is
21
years
ago.
and
for
the
convenience
of
the
court,
i
printed
the
text
of
this
in
the
reply
brief
which
has
been
filed
in
the
correll
case
on
page
11
of
the
reply
brief
are
set
out
the
instructions,
the
official
instructions
which
the
commissioner
has
used
with
respect
to
form
1040,
the
standard
taxpayer
return
form.
and
since
1948,
these
instructions
have
always
specified
as
indicated
that
near
at
the
top
of
page
11,
the
last
sentence
of
the
indented
quotation
traveling
“away
from
home”
means
going
away
from
the
city
or
town
where
you
normally
work
and
remaining
away
at
least
overnight.
and
you'll
find
that
phrase
at
least
overnight
in
all
the
rest
of
the
instructions
right
down
through
1966.
the
1967
instructions
i
believe
have
not
yet
appeared.
in
addition
the
commissioner
puts
out
a
booklet
called
“your
federal
income
tax,”
and
since
1946,
as
quoted
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
12,
this
booklet
has
specifically
referred
to
require
his
absence
overnight,
at
top
of
page
13
from
which
he
does
not
return
the
same
day.
the
1955
edition
is
quoted
at
the
bottom
of
page
13
in
the
last
full
line
and
remaining
away
at
least
overnight.
you
then
find
some
modification
beginning
in
the
59
and
the
63
editions
where
there
is
a
reference
to
necessitate
relief
from
duty
to
obtain
sleep
or
to
obtain
necessary
sleep
showing
the
transition
to
the
sleep
or
rest
rule
which
seems
to
me
to
be
inappropriate
and
thoroughly
sound
than
refinement
of
the
originally
stated
overnight
rule.
in
1954,
the
internal
revenue
code
was
given
a
comprehensive
revision.
and
there
was
some
reference
to
this
problem
in
three
situations.
in
the
first
place
at
the
hearings,
a
taxpayer
appeared
objected
to
the
overnight
rule
and
set
it
out
to
be
changed.
no
change
was
made.
i
don't
put
great
significance
in
that.
i
simply
record
it
as
one
of
the
facts.
two
amendments
were
made
to
the
statute
in
1954.
one
was
the
enactment
of
a
section
120
which
specifically
allowed
a
state
policeman
to
deduct
an
amount
of
$5.00
a
day
and
in
the
provision
which
is
sent
then
repealed
by
congress
because
it
was
found
impossible
to
justify
this
special
deduction
for
state
policemen
when
such
a
deduction
was
not
available
for
others.
but
in
the
committee
report
with
respect
to
that,
congress
referred
specifically
to
the
fact
that
the
application
of
the
statute
at
that
time
allowed
for
the
deduction
for
meals
while
away
from
home
overnight.
mr.
griswold
that
is
on
the
--
this
is
on
pages
17
and
18,
and
the
exact
quotation
from
the
committee
report
is
on
page
18
about
three
inches
from
the
top
of
the
page
for
meals
while
away
from
home
overnight,
the
overnight
is
printed
in
italics
in
the
brief
and
those
are
italics,
the
committee
report
is
simply
printed
in
ordinary
type.
there
was
also
another
provision
in
1954.
this
problem
arises
not
only
with
respect
to
the
deduction
in
section
162,
but
in
a
somewhat
mildly
complicated
way
with
respect
to
the
determination
of
adjusted
gross
income
which
for
practical
purposes
means
whether
you
can
get
the
deduction
and
also
take
the
standard
deduction
of
10%
of
your
income.
and
until
1954,
because
of
the
way
the
statute
was
worded,
there
was
a
difference
wholly
unjustified
between
the
taxpayer
who
paid
his
own
travel
expenses
and
the
taxpayer
who
was
reimbursed
by
his
employer
with
respect
to
the
travel
expenses.
when
congress
straightened
that
out
in
1954
by
an
amendment
to
section
622
(c)
and
again,
the
committee
report
expressly
refers
to
the
fact
that
the
commissioner's
rule
is
away
from
home
overnight.
now
there
was
no
official
dissent
from
that
view
until
1962
when
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeal
decided
a
case
called
hanson.
there
was
an
earlier
case
in
the
first
circuit
which
uses
a
language
to
the
effect
that
the
commissioner's
construction
of
the
statute
is
something
that
he
dreamed
up
but
actually
the
first
circuit
case
involved
a
railroad
conductor
who
took
a
long
trip
to
a
distant
place,
took
a
room
for
sleep
or
rest,
and
came
back.
and
as
i've
indicated
the
commissioner
has
long
since
accepted
that
goes
on
the
overnight
rule.
but
it
was
the
hanson
case
in
the
eighth
circuit
which
first
threw
uncertainty
into
that
picture.
i
may
mention
just
to
complete
the
statutory
history
that
in
1962,
section
162
was
amended
in
a
way
which
is
not
applicable
here
because
the
years
involved
here
are
1960
and
‘61
but
which
is
also
clearly
not
relevant
because
what
it
did
was
simply
to
limit
the
deduction
to
amounts
which
are
not
leverage
in
amount
and
there's
not
suggestion
that
anything
of
that
sort
was
involved.
finally
in
1963,
the
treasury
recommended
to
congress
that
the
statute
be
changed.
this
is
referred
to
on
pages
25
and
26
of
the
government's
brief.
the
treasury
suggested
that
the
deduction
be
allowed
where
there
was
an
absence
of
16
hours
or
more
and
where
substantial
arrest
was
needed
in
connection
with
the
travel.
it
also
suggested
that
there
be
a
duty
area
which
would
be
a
circle
of
20
miles
radius.
nothing
came
of
this
recommendation.
it
was
not
reported
out
of
the
committee
on
ways
and
means.
and
i
mentioned
that
simply
to
complete
the
story.
now,
one
can
look
at
this
statutory
language
and
try
to
search
out
the
“meaning
of
congress.”
and
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
a
rather
illusory
matter
because
i
find
it
difficult
to
find
any
evidence
that
congress
ever
thought
about
this
detailed
application
of
the
statutory
provision.
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
is
essentially
a
case
of
tax
administration.
that
congress
has
committed
the
administration
of
this
statute
to
the
treasury
has
authorized
the
commissioner
to
make
appropriate
rules
and
regulations
and
the
commissioner
has
made
such
rules
and
regulations.
they
might
may
or
may
not
be
the
same
as
a
court
would
make
as
an
original
proposition.
but
my
thought
would
be
that
unless
the
court
finds
that
this
is
an
unreasonable
or
wholly
inappropriate
construction
and
application
of
the
statute,
it
should
be
upheld.
there
are
two
problems,
or
there
is
a
problem
arising
from
the
application
of
these
two
statutory
provisions.
i
repeat,
if
there
was
section
162
alone,
i
wouldn't
doubt
that
these
meal
expenses
would
be
deductible.
if
there
was
section
262
alone,
no
deduction
allowed
for
personal
family
and
living
expenses
seems
to
me
equally
declare
that
the
meal
expenses
would
not
be
deductible.
what
you
actually
have
then
is
the
two
statutory
provisions;
both
obviously
intended
to
be
given
some
effect
by
congress.
and
the
problem
is
to
work
out
a
practical
administrable
way
to
give
appropriate
application
to
these
provisions
and
i
suggest
to
at
the
same
time,
to
provide
a
measure
of
equality
of
treatment
between
taxpayers
who
are
similarly
situated.
mr.
griswold
that
would
certainly
be
arguable
except
that
i
think
the
ground
upon
which
this
court
put
the
flowers
decision,
commissioner
against
flowers
which
was
to
the
effect
that
the
commuting
expenses
involved
there
arose
not
out
of
the
business,
but
out
of
his
personal
choice,
it
might
be
negative,
or
that
would
be
more
difficult
if
there
weren't
any
section
262.
mr.
griswold
sometimes
it
is
said
that
what
flowers
means
is
that
home
is
your
regular
place
of
the
business
which
it
gave
rise
to
the
quip
of
the
man
kissing
his
wife
goodbye
in
the
morning
and
saying
“goodbye
my
love,
i'm
going
home
to
work.
i'll
be
back
here
this
evening.”
obviously,
there
is
a
problem
of
construction
here.
i
think
everyone
has
agreed
that
the
commuter's
expenses
ought
not
to
be
deductible.
i
suppose
that
the
rest
under
section
262,
but
it
might
also
be
regarded
as
a
construction
of
all
the
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
of
carrying
on
the
trade
or
business.
the
commuter's
expenses
might
be
regarded
as
not
business
expenses
even
if
there
were
not
section
262.
mr.
griswold
well
that's
the
--
if
that
is
the
effect
which
is
to
be
given
to
flowers,
that
home
means
principal
place
of
business,
that
would
be
the
situation.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
rather
narrow
grounds
on
which
this
case
can
be
put.
one
is
suggested
by
judge
aldrich
in
the
bagley
opinion.
he
says
that
the
statute
refers
to
meals
and
lodging,
and
that
unless
there's
also
lodging
that
maybe
it
can
be
argued
that
there's
no
deduction
for
meals.
another
basis
of
dealing
with
the
problem
it
seems
to
me
would
distinguish
between
the
person
who
makes
an
occasional
or
sporadic
business
trip.
the
new
york
lawyer
who
has
a
case
before
this
court
comes
down
to
washington,
goes
back
the
same
evening
on
the
one
hand.
and
taxpayers
like
the
present
taxpayer
who
does
it
regularly
as
a
matter
of
course.
if
the
place
of
business,
if
home
is
the
place
of
business,
this
taxpayer
took
his
place
of
business
along
with
him.
among
other
things,
it's
a
little
hard
to
see
why
this
taxpayer
should
be
allowed
to
deduct
two
meals,
both
breakfast
and
lunch,
when
the
similar
situated
taxpayer,
indeed
some
of
his
fellow
employees
who
work
only
in
one
community,
are
not
allowed
to
deduct
either
meal
and
while
the
ordinary
taxpayer
can't
deduct
his
lunch
because
that
is
of
course
a
personal
family
or
living
expense.
the
suggestion
is
made
in
some
of
the
court
of
appeals
decisions
that
each
case
must
turn
on
its
own
facts
that
the
questions
must
come
up
before
the
courts
and
be
decided
case
by
case.
and
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
a
thoroughly
unsound
way
to
administer
a
tax
system.
here
we
have
a
homely
problem
arising
some
47
years
after
the
statute
was
enacted,
arising
after
some
20
years
in
which
it
was
uniformly
applied
in
decisions
sustained
by
the
courts,
the
problems
arise
only
because
the
courts
have
sought
to
move
into
a
problem
which
is
essentially
one
of
administration.
and
to
say
that
this
should
be
decided
in
each
case
by
courts
depending
upon
their
separate
facts
as
to
use
a
phrase
of
my
old
colleague
professor
tomas
reed
powell
to
introduce
a
chaos
of
independent
episodes
instead
of
something
approaching
an
orderly
system.
of
all
kinds
of
questions
that
could
arise,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
one
which
ought
to
be
capable
of
determination
in
an
orderly
way
that
revenue
agents
and
taxpayers
can
understand.
i
think
that
there
are
numerous
rules
which
might
be
applied
here
time
away,
distance
away,
and
so
on.
i
don't
see
that
anyone
of
them
is
any
better
than
the
rule
of
which
the
commissioner
has
devised
and
has
thought
to
apply
over
a
long
period
of
time.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
sound
and
wise
tax
and
judicial
administration
call
for
upholding
the
construction
adopted
by
the
commissioner.
mr.
griswold
there
is
no
doubt
that
under
this
rule,
the
line
is
drawn
at
overnight
or
a
sleep
or
rest.
there's
equally
no
doubt
that
there
will
be
cases
very
close
to
any
line
that
you
draw
which
make
those
cases
seemed
very
close
together.
our
position
is
that
there
is
a
difference.
there
is
a
point
where
a
substantial
additional
cost
is
likely
to
be
incurred
in
the
general
case
when
you
are
required
to
take
lodging
as
well
as
meals.
if
--
one
way
to
put
it
is
as
your
honor
did,
he
say
that
to
put
a
premium
on
staying
away
overnight.
indeed
in
this
very
case,
the
correll
case,
it
appeared
that
some
of
the
salesman
had
territories
under
which
they
did
from
time
to
time
stay
away
overnight.
and
their
entire
cost
of
meals
and
lodging
were
allowed
as
deductions.
similarly
in
the
bagley
case,
it
appeared
that
for
one
reason
or
another,
at
one
of
the
jobs
he
went
to
which
was
rather
closer
than
the
others,
or
from
30
miles
away.
he
did
as
a
matter
of
course,
stay
overnight
and
the
amount
of
his
meals
and
lodging
was
allowed
as
a
deduction.
i
wouldn't
say
that
it
could
have
premium
on
staying
away
overnight.
i
would
say
that
the
commissioner
has
thought
to
recognize
a
place
to
draw
the
line
where
there
is
in
the
general
case,
a
substantial
distinction.
and
that
staying
overnight
is
such
a
distinction.
mr.
griswold
the
commissioner's
overnight
rule?
no,
on
the
contrary
what
the
commissioner
did
in
1963
was
to
suggest
a
16-hour
rule
with
rest
required
together
with
a
20-mile
radius
around
the
post
of
duty.
and
nothing
fell
flatter
than
that.
