mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
this
court.
to
digest
one
moment
and
answer
to
justice
fortas'
question.
i
think
the
very
essence
of
the
overnight
rule
is
contrary
to
the
american
business
concept
that
a
man
is
in
business
to
make
a
profit.
and
yet
to
establish
such
a
rule
as
the
overnight
rule,
it
does
generate
a
man
or
make
it
more
beneficial
to
him
for
the
deduction
of
these
expenses
to
stay
away
overnight
which
is
--
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
well,
sir
--
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
well,
most
businessmen
are
very
conscious
of
tax
deductions
today,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
can
see
that
point.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
i
think
that
it
might
become
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
salesman
would
push
a
little
harder
to
get
home
versus
whether
or
not
he
would
be
on
the
road
and
thereby
know
that
his
--
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir,
it
does.
but
still
the
question
involved
though
is
contrary
to
the
concept
of
american
business
profits
because
it
does
reduce
these
profits.
and
thereby
the
rule
itself,
the
tax
administration
rule
in
my
interpretation
harbors.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
to
--
at
the
risk
of
being
someone
repetitious
i
think
it
is
essential
that
we
commence
with
a
great
review
of
some
of
the
facts
which
the
petitioner
has
reviewed.
first
of
all,
i
think
that
it
is
important
to
note
that
mr.
correll
does
rise
in
a
very
early
hour
each
morning
and
that
he
does
travel
a
distance
of
approximately
50
miles
each
day
before
he
reach
in
new
york
or
makes
any
calls
on
any
of
customers.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir,
it
is.
his
employer
requires
that
he'd
be
at
a
given
location
on
a
given
morning
at
a
given
time.
so
that
he
may
reach
him
for
the
purposes
of
giving
him
essential
price
data
or
other
essential
data
in
the
course
of
fulfilling
his
duties
as
a
salesman.
that
also
is
accomplished
or
is
used
because
of
the
fact
that
he
then
may
eat
at
a
restaurant
and
make
a
call
on
this
restaurant
who
is
a
customer
of
his
at
the
same
time.
so
he
can
search
this
time,
he
creates
a
goodwill
element
between
himself
and
his
customer.
and
he's
there
at
the
convenience
of
his
employer,
at
the
requirement
of
his
employer.
excuse
me.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
record
in
the
trial
of
this
case
demonstrates
in
the
employers
who
testified
that
he
was
required
to
eat
with
his
customers.
that
is
both
true
at
breakfast
and
at
lunch.
so
we
do
see
here
that
mr.
correll's
expenses
for
meals
were
business
generated,
not
personal
choices.
i
think
that
perhaps
we
ought
to
also
distinguish
the
fact
that
mr.
correll
while
he
live
in
fountain
city,
his
entire
route
was
away
from
his
home
area
in
fountain
city.
and
yet
by
comparison,
his
business,
his
employer
was
actually
in
morristown,
tennessee
which
is
some
35
or
40
miles
away
from
fountain
city.
however,
he
very
infrequently
ever
traveled
to
morristown
conversing
with
his
employer
either
by
mail
or
by
telephone.
during
the
course
of
mr.
correll's
day,
he
of
course
would
call
on
his
various
customers
eating
lunch
again
away
from
home
on
his
route
and
then
would
complete
his
trip
and
return
to
his
home
in
fountain
city
between
5:30
and
6:00
pm
in
the
afternoon
of
each
day.
he
did
not
spend
any
nights
away
from
home
during
these
years
in
question.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
no,
sir.
he
ate
with
a
customer,
a
restaurant
upon
whom
he
was
making
a
call.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir.
he
did
not
in
effect
entertain
a
customer
in
the
process
of
buying
his
own
breakfast
or
lunch.
however,
it
can
be
clearly
seen
from
these
particular
facts
that
mr.
correll
incurred
his
expenses
as
a
result
of
his
employment
while
in
a
travel
status
and
while
he
was
away
from
home.
and
i
think
that
in
using
that
word
“home”,
we
must
again
differentiate
between
the
idea
of
the
commuter.
he
is
definitely
in
the
cases
such
as
flowers
or
james.
i
don't
believe
that
is
question
involved
in
this
particular
case.
in
fact
the
commissioner
has
never
raised
the
question
in
this
particular
case
as
to
whether
or
not
mr.
correll
left
his
home.
he
has
merely
asserted
that
mr.
correll
has
not
remained
away
from
his
home
long
enough
to
be
entitled
to
his
meal
deductions.
attorney
--
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
that
your
honor
is
basically
what
the
respondent
would
contend
is
the
rule
laid
down
by
the
statute.
i
would
go
a
little
farther
and
say
that
i
think
that
the
rule
as
laid
down
by
the
statute
requires
the
commissioner
to
determine
whether
or
not,
there
is
a
legitimate
travel
status.
and
by
that
i
mean
that
we
must
look
to
his
business
generated
travel
as
to
whether
or
not
the
man
is
traveling
for
business
purposes
and
then
secondly,
whether
or
not
he
has
moved
away
from
his
home
in
the
course
of
his
business
travel.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
well
sir,
i
don't
believe
in
that
particular
incidence
that
the
phrase
“away
from
home”
would
comply
in
meeting
the
test
for
the
deduction.
i
think
that
the
code
section
is
limiting
in
this
respect
that
you
must
be
away
from
your
so-called
tax
home
in
order
to
obtain
a
meal
deduction.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
i
believe
that
this
court
has
in
effect
by
ruling
such
as
in
the
flowers
case
in
the
sense
of
commuter
held
in
effect
that
the
tax
home
is
the
general
area
and
that
comparison
area
where
a
person's
business
is
permanently
located
or
generally
located.
and
i
think
that
the
respondent
would
concede
the
fact
that
the
commuter's
expenses
are
not
deductible
and
under
your
construction.
i'm
not
too
here
but
what
the
commuter's
expenses
would
be
deductible.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir.
plus
--
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
there
is
another
distinction
here
too
that
perhaps
in
looking
at
the
overall
in
ten
of
various
code
sections,
when
reading
162
in
conjunction
with
section
62,
we
say
that
congress
has
intended
to
categorize
a
person
in
a
travel
status
versus
a
person
who
is
not
in
a
travel
status.
under
section
62,
in
order
to
determine
what
the
phrase
“adjusted
gross
income,”
the
code
section
entitles
the
person
to
deduct
travel
expenses
incurred
while
away
from
home
under
i
think
its
62
(b).
and
under
62
(c),
it
entitles
a
person
who
is
traveling
in
and
around
a
local
area
only
transportation
expenses.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
commissioner's
regulations
actually,
and
i
have
them
here,
actually
point
out
that
there
is
a
distinction
under
his
regulation
1.62-1
subparagraph
g,
and
i
quote
this
“transportation
as
used
in
section
622
(c)
is
a
narrow
concept
in
travel”
as
used
in
section
622
(b)
which
is
speaking
of
the
expenses
away
from
home
and
does
not
include
meals
and
lodging.
the
term
“transportation
expense”
includes
only
the
cost
of
transporting
the
employee
from
one
place
to
another
in
the
course
of
his
employment
while
he
is
not
away
from
home
in
a
travel
status.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
it
would
be
our
contention
that
this
would
be
a
travel
expenses
as
long
as
the
trip
were
business
generated.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
and
it
would
be
fully
deductible
under
the
code
section.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
true.
that's
the
current
policy
of
the
commissioner.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
those
are
his
employer
requested
that
he
eat
with
a
given
customer.
you
see,
mr.
correll
sold
wholesale
groceries
both
to
institutional
and
retail
outlets.
and
he
was
requested
that
he
take
his
meals
with
one
of
this
institutional
customers
and
restaurant
so
that
in
effect,
the
restaurant
would
see
that
he
was
being
patronized
by
men
who
wanted
to
sell
it,
and
secondly,
because
the
employer
wanting
to
be
able
to
know
where
he
was
at
a
given
time
so
that
he
could
reach
him
by
telephone.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
your
question.
no,
just
at
his
place
of
business.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
he
would
still
have
to
be
--
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
well
of
course,
we'll
have
to
consider
the
point
that
he
did
not
want.
i
believe
the
proof
and
the
record
shows
that
he
did
not
want
to
get
his
family
up
in
such
an
early
hour.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
a
home
to
come
on
to.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
if
he
got
her
up
too
often,
i'm
sure
he
would
not.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
no,
sir.
i
--
i
agree
with
court
in
trying
with
that
respect.
but
our
contention
is
not
hinged
upon
the
question
of
the
hour
or
really
upon
the
question
of
the
time
that
he's
away.
our
contention
is
the
rule
as
laid
down
by
the
statute
under
162
says
that
it's
a
travel
status.
and
until
this
is
determined,
the
meals
nor
the
lodging,
nor
anything
else
in
connection
with
this
trip
is
a
legitimate
deduction
under
revenue
code.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
well,
of
course,
we'll
have
to
say
in
benefit
of
our
client,
we
were
relying
upon
on
the
--
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
the
business
generated
expense
and
i
think
that
the
petitioner
has
clearly
pointed
this
out
that
the
intent
of
the
statute
when
it
was
originally
placed
in
the
code
in
1921,
was
to
entitle
such
man
into
travel
status
to
the
entire
amount
of
his
meal
and
lodging,
irrespective
of
whether
or
not
it
audit
was
in
excess
of
or
less
than
what
he
would
have
incurred.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
but
in
19
--
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
right
sir.
but
--
but
when
they
change
it
in
1921,
in
effect
and
since
that
time,
the
indication
as
we
interpret
it
though;
would
be
that
as
long
as
he's
in
a
travel
status,
the
full
amount
is
deductible
irrespective
of
whether
or
not
there's
an
excess
of
his
home
expenses.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
no,
we
did
not
contend
that.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
well,
it
perhaps
is
but
there
was
no
proof
i
think
at
the
trial
and
the
respondent
did
not
rely
upon
that
as
an
element
improving
his
case.
the
--
the
respondent
relies
up
on
the
fact
that
he
was
in
a
legitimate
travel
status.
and
as
such
the
meal
expense
was
deducted.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
oh,
i
think
mr.
correll's
instance,
it's
an
element
involved
because
the
fact
that
he
had
to
be
at
a
given
location
at
a
given
time.
a
--
a
man
who
is
at
home
and
maybe
gets
up
a
little
early
to
be
somewhere
a
little
early
unless
it
is
business
generated,
unless
it
also
goes
so
far
as
to
be
away
from
home
in
a
travel
status
would
not
come
onto
this
particular
route.
in
mr.
correll's
case,
he
was
fortunate
enough
not
only
be
required
to
get
up
by
his
employer,
excuse
me,
and
be
away
from
home
in
an
early
hour,
but
he
did
travel
approximately
50
miles
in
a
legitimate
travel
status
generated
for
business
reasons.
so
we
contend
that
that
is
a
clear
distinction
in
his
case
versus
the
example
which
you
get.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
something
like
that.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
your
honor,
i
have
to
answer
the
question
in
this
respect.
the
peculiar
facts
of
this
case
of
course,
would
determine
mr.
correll's
incidence
a
deductible
item.
however,
i
think
we
would
have
to
examine
each
case
up
on
its
own
facts
to
see
whether
or
not
each
of
these
men
we're
in
a
legitimate
travel
status.
the
point
which
has
been
made
by
the
petitioner
here
that
the
rule
that
each
case
must
determine
up
on
its
own
facts
is
not
workable
administratively.
then
in
effect
by
his
own
admission,
that
all
of
the
deduction
sections
in
the
internal
revenue
code
are
not
workable.
because
as
a
common
knowledge,
practically
every
code
when
interpreting
a
code
section
pertaining
to
especially
section
162
expenses.
they
have
premise
their
findings
that
it
is
always
based
upon
the
facts
of
each
individual
case.
and
i
do
not
see
how
did
that
within
itself
would
make
our
contentions
unworkable
as
far
as
the
commissioner
is
concerned.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
to
be
specific,
i
contend
that
each
individual
case
would
have
to
stand
up
on
its
own
facts
under
section
162(a)
(2).
i
think
that
the
implementation
of
this
section
is
further
made
easier
by
section
274
of
the
internal
revenue
code
wherein
certain
substantiation
of
business
generated
expenses
must
be
kept
according
to
records
and
receipts.
and
i
think
that
this
in
itself
indicates
that
congress
intended
that
all
of
these
expenses
would
have
to
rest
upon
their
own
facts.
and
i
think
that
the
very
essence
of
our
tax
administration
system
in
that
we
must
file
our
own
tax
return.
and
that
only
if
it's
audited
there's
the
question
come
up.
practically
speaking,
it
solves
your
problem
a
great
deal.
but
i
think
that
to
answer
specifically,
they
would
have
to
rest
up
on
its
own
facts.
i
think
that
perhaps
i
should
direct
a
few
remarks
to
the
case
of
bagley
which
was
decided
in
the
first
circuit
subsequently
to
the
decision
of
six
circuit
in
correll.
i
think
unquestionably
that
the
government's
contentions
carried
great
weight
with
justice
aldrich
his
decision
of
that
case.
however,
i
think
that
justice
aldrich
assumed
that
some
rule
had
to
be
established
and
since
the
sixth
or
the
eighth
circuits
actually
specified
in
so
many
words
a
clear
rule
other
than
what
statute
read,
they
as
a
matter
of
convenience
adopted
the
commissioner's
rule.
however,
for
the
sake
of
argument
here
today,
i'm
not
saying
that
the
commissioner's
rule
is
the
rule
of
convenience.
but
conceding
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
it
is,
it
is
at
the
respondent's
contention
that
even
if
it
is
the
most
workable
rule
that
is
possible,
without
an
expressed
authorization
in
section
162
as
to
sleep
or
rest
or
as
to
overnight
then,
i
do
not
believe
that
this
court
or
any
court
can
apply
just
because
it
is
administratively
convenient
because
the
law
does
not
specify.
it
does
not
give
the
commissioner
the
power
to
administer
such
a
rule.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
under
the
regulations
however,
the
commissioner
has
made
no
reference
to
the
overnight
rule.
in
the
substantive
regulations
under
section
162,
there
is
no
specification
that
the
overnight
rule
is
enforced
to
entitle
man
to
a
deduction.
there
are
other
references
to
it
in
the
administrative
regulations
pertaining
to
keeping
the
records
but
nowhere
in
the
substantive
portion
of
the
regulations
is
there
a
reference
to
the
overnight
rule.
i
think
that
was
pointed
out
in
the
tax
court's
opinion
in
bagley
which
by
the
way
reversed
as
the
petitioner
has
pointed
out,
reversed
a
very
long
standing
rule
of
the
tax
court,
and
rule
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer.
and
then
justice
aldrich
in
the
first
circuit
turned
it
around
again
and
put
it
back
in.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
except
that
you
use
the
word
“invalidate”
the
commissioner's
rule.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
have
to
admit
that
he
has
interpreted
this
for
a
number
of
years.
of
course,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
was
actually
law
or
should
be
law
is
another
matter
for
this
court
to
determine.
but
i
would
say
that
basically
our
rule
is
that
again
repeating
is
the
fact
that
we
must
ascertain
whether
or
not
it
is
a
legitimate
travel
status.
and
it
was
generated
for
business
purposes.
and
that
the
expenses
were
incurred
away
from
home
which
in
mr.
correll's
case,
we
contend
was
clearly
the
case.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
i
think
that
that
was
the
intent
--
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
taxpayer
by
taxpayer,
all
of
each
individual
return.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
very
nature
of
the
trial
and
whether
or
not,
he
is
generated
for
business
purposes
throughout
the
code
sections
is
constant.
they're
constantly
setting
up
circumstances
where
the
facts
of
each
case
must
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
a
business
deduction.
and
we
contend
that
that
is
a
reasonable
rule
and
it's
a
rule
which
has
been
enforced
since
the
revenue
code
has
been
adopted.
in
closing,
the
respondent
would
like
to
urge
this
court
to
adopt
the
rule
of
the
legitimate
trial
status
because
we
contend
that
this
rule
is
founded
in
the
statute.
that
this
rule
was
distinguished
between
the
commuter
who
comes
from
his
home
in
connecticut
to
the
new
york
city
in
his
office,
and
the
man
who
gets
on
a
jet
liner
and
flies
from
new
york
to
chicago
and
has
lunch
and
comes
back.
or
it
would
distinguish
between
a
situation
of
mr.
correll's
one
day
travel
where
his
expenses
are
generated
for
business
purposes.
and
we
believe
that
this
rule
does
not
involve
an
artificial
construction
of
section
162
wherein
the
word
“overnight”
or
sleep
or
rest
is
superimposed
in
that
section.
and
by
virtue
of
this,
that
the
code
section
would
be
construed
and
it's
clear,
and
it's
an
ambiguous
meaning,
and
thereby
would
be
according
to
the
intent
of
congress.
thank
you.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
this
court.
to
digest
one
moment
and
answer
to
justice
fortas'
question.
i
think
the
very
essence
of
the
overnight
rule
is
contrary
to
the
american
business
concept
that
a
man
is
in
business
to
make
a
profit.
and
yet
to
establish
such
a
rule
as
the
overnight
rule,
it
does
generate
a
man
or
make
it
more
beneficial
to
him
for
the
deduction
of
these
expenses
to
stay
away
overnight
which
is
--
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
well,
sir
--
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
well,
most
businessmen
are
very
conscious
of
tax
deductions
today,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
can
see
that
point.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
i
think
that
it
might
become
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
salesman
would
push
a
little
harder
to
get
home
versus
whether
or
not
he
would
be
on
the
road
and
thereby
know
that
his
--
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir,
it
does.
but
still
the
question
involved
though
is
contrary
to
the
concept
of
american
business
profits
because
it
does
reduce
these
profits.
and
thereby
the
rule
itself,
the
tax
administration
rule
in
my
interpretation
harbors.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
to
--
at
the
risk
of
being
someone
repetitious
i
think
it
is
essential
that
we
commence
with
a
great
review
of
some
of
the
facts
which
the
petitioner
has
reviewed.
first
of
all,
i
think
that
it
is
important
to
note
that
mr.
correll
does
rise
in
a
very
early
hour
each
morning
and
that
he
does
travel
a
distance
of
approximately
50
miles
each
day
before
he
reach
in
new
york
or
makes
any
calls
on
any
of
customers.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir,
it
is.
his
employer
requires
that
he'd
be
at
a
given
location
on
a
given
morning
at
a
given
time.
so
that
he
may
reach
him
for
the
purposes
of
giving
him
essential
price
data
or
other
essential
data
in
the
course
of
fulfilling
his
duties
as
a
salesman.
that
also
is
accomplished
or
is
used
because
of
the
fact
that
he
then
may
eat
at
a
restaurant
and
make
a
call
on
this
restaurant
who
is
a
customer
of
his
at
the
same
time.
so
he
can
search
this
time,
he
creates
a
goodwill
element
between
himself
and
his
customer.
and
he's
there
at
the
convenience
of
his
employer,
at
the
requirement
of
his
employer.
excuse
me.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
record
in
the
trial
of
this
case
demonstrates
in
the
employers
who
testified
that
he
was
required
to
eat
with
his
customers.
that
is
both
true
at
breakfast
and
at
lunch.
so
we
do
see
here
that
mr.
correll's
expenses
for
meals
were
business
generated,
not
personal
choices.
i
think
that
perhaps
we
ought
to
also
distinguish
the
fact
that
mr.
correll
while
he
live
in
fountain
city,
his
entire
route
was
away
from
his
home
area
in
fountain
city.
and
yet
by
comparison,
his
business,
his
employer
was
actually
in
morristown,
tennessee
which
is
some
35
or
40
miles
away
from
fountain
city.
however,
he
very
infrequently
ever
traveled
to
morristown
conversing
with
his
employer
either
by
mail
or
by
telephone.
during
the
course
of
mr.
correll's
day,
he
of
course
would
call
on
his
various
customers
eating
lunch
again
away
from
home
on
his
route
and
then
would
complete
his
trip
and
return
to
his
home
in
fountain
city
between
5:30
and
6:00
pm
in
the
afternoon
of
each
day.
he
did
not
spend
any
nights
away
from
home
during
these
years
in
question.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
no,
sir.
he
ate
with
a
customer,
a
restaurant
upon
whom
he
was
making
a
call.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir.
he
did
not
in
effect
entertain
a
customer
in
the
process
of
buying
his
own
breakfast
or
lunch.
however,
it
can
be
clearly
seen
from
these
particular
facts
that
mr.
correll
incurred
his
expenses
as
a
result
of
his
employment
while
in
a
travel
status
and
while
he
was
away
from
home.
and
i
think
that
in
using
that
word
“home”,
we
must
again
differentiate
between
the
idea
of
the
commuter.
he
is
definitely
in
the
cases
such
as
flowers
or
james.
i
don't
believe
that
is
question
involved
in
this
particular
case.
in
fact
the
commissioner
has
never
raised
the
question
in
this
particular
case
as
to
whether
or
not
mr.
correll
left
his
home.
he
has
merely
asserted
that
mr.
correll
has
not
remained
away
from
his
home
long
enough
to
be
entitled
to
his
meal
deductions.
attorney
--
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
that
your
honor
is
basically
what
the
respondent
would
contend
is
the
rule
laid
down
by
the
statute.
i
would
go
a
little
farther
and
say
that
i
think
that
the
rule
as
laid
down
by
the
statute
requires
the
commissioner
to
determine
whether
or
not,
there
is
a
legitimate
travel
status.
and
by
that
i
mean
that
we
must
look
to
his
business
generated
travel
as
to
whether
or
not
the
man
is
traveling
for
business
purposes
and
then
secondly,
whether
or
not
he
has
moved
away
from
his
home
in
the
course
of
his
business
travel.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
well
sir,
i
don't
believe
in
that
particular
incidence
that
the
phrase
“away
from
home”
would
comply
in
meeting
the
test
for
the
deduction.
i
think
that
the
code
section
is
limiting
in
this
respect
that
you
must
be
away
from
your
so-called
tax
home
in
order
to
obtain
a
meal
deduction.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
i
believe
that
this
court
has
in
effect
by
ruling
such
as
in
the
flowers
case
in
the
sense
of
commuter
held
in
effect
that
the
tax
home
is
the
general
area
and
that
comparison
area
where
a
person's
business
is
permanently
located
or
generally
located.
and
i
think
that
the
respondent
would
concede
the
fact
that
the
commuter's
expenses
are
not
deductible
and
under
your
construction.
i'm
not
too
here
but
what
the
commuter's
expenses
would
be
deductible.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir.
plus
--
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
there
is
another
distinction
here
too
that
perhaps
in
looking
at
the
overall
in
ten
of
various
code
sections,
when
reading
162
in
conjunction
with
section
62,
we
say
that
congress
has
intended
to
categorize
a
person
in
a
travel
status
versus
a
person
who
is
not
in
a
travel
status.
under
section
62,
in
order
to
determine
what
the
phrase
“adjusted
gross
income,”
the
code
section
entitles
the
person
to
deduct
travel
expenses
incurred
while
away
from
home
under
i
think
its
62
(b).
and
under
62
(c),
it
entitles
a
person
who
is
traveling
in
and
around
a
local
area
only
transportation
expenses.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
commissioner's
regulations
actually,
and
i
have
them
here,
actually
point
out
that
there
is
a
distinction
under
his
regulation
1.62-1
subparagraph
g,
and
i
quote
this
“transportation
as
used
in
section
622
(c)
is
a
narrow
concept
in
travel”
as
used
in
section
622
(b)
which
is
speaking
of
the
expenses
away
from
home
and
does
not
include
meals
and
lodging.
the
term
“transportation
expense”
includes
only
the
cost
of
transporting
the
employee
from
one
place
to
another
in
the
course
of
his
employment
while
he
is
not
away
from
home
in
a
travel
status.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
it
would
be
our
contention
that
this
would
be
a
travel
expenses
as
long
as
the
trip
were
business
generated.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
and
it
would
be
fully
deductible
under
the
code
section.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
true.
that's
the
current
policy
of
the
commissioner.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
those
are
his
employer
requested
that
he
eat
with
a
given
customer.
you
see,
mr.
correll
sold
wholesale
groceries
both
to
institutional
and
retail
outlets.
and
he
was
requested
that
he
take
his
meals
with
one
of
this
institutional
customers
and
restaurant
so
that
in
effect,
the
restaurant
would
see
that
he
was
being
patronized
by
men
who
wanted
to
sell
it,
and
secondly,
because
the
employer
wanting
to
be
able
to
know
where
he
was
at
a
given
time
so
that
he
could
reach
him
by
telephone.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
your
question.
no,
just
at
his
place
of
business.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
he
would
still
have
to
be
--
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
well
of
course,
we'll
have
to
consider
the
point
that
he
did
not
want.
i
believe
the
proof
and
the
record
shows
that
he
did
not
want
to
get
his
family
up
in
such
an
early
hour.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
a
home
to
come
on
to.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
if
he
got
her
up
too
often,
i'm
sure
he
would
not.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
no,
sir.
i
--
i
agree
with
court
in
trying
with
that
respect.
but
our
contention
is
not
hinged
upon
the
question
of
the
hour
or
really
upon
the
question
of
the
time
that
he's
away.
our
contention
is
the
rule
as
laid
down
by
the
statute
under
162
says
that
it's
a
travel
status.
and
until
this
is
determined,
the
meals
nor
the
lodging,
nor
anything
else
in
connection
with
this
trip
is
a
legitimate
deduction
under
revenue
code.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
well,
of
course,
we'll
have
to
say
in
benefit
of
our
client,
we
were
relying
upon
on
the
--
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
the
business
generated
expense
and
i
think
that
the
petitioner
has
clearly
pointed
this
out
that
the
intent
of
the
statute
when
it
was
originally
placed
in
the
code
in
1921,
was
to
entitle
such
man
into
travel
status
to
the
entire
amount
of
his
meal
and
lodging,
irrespective
of
whether
or
not
it
audit
was
in
excess
of
or
less
than
what
he
would
have
incurred.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
but
in
19
--
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
right
sir.
but
--
but
when
they
change
it
in
1921,
in
effect
and
since
that
time,
the
indication
as
we
interpret
it
though;
would
be
that
as
long
as
he's
in
a
travel
status,
the
full
amount
is
deductible
irrespective
of
whether
or
not
there's
an
excess
of
his
home
expenses.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
no,
we
did
not
contend
that.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
well,
it
perhaps
is
but
there
was
no
proof
i
think
at
the
trial
and
the
respondent
did
not
rely
upon
that
as
an
element
improving
his
case.
the
--
the
respondent
relies
up
on
the
fact
that
he
was
in
a
legitimate
travel
status.
and
as
such
the
meal
expense
was
deducted.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
oh,
i
think
mr.
correll's
instance,
it's
an
element
involved
because
the
fact
that
he
had
to
be
at
a
given
location
at
a
given
time.
a
--
a
man
who
is
at
home
and
maybe
gets
up
a
little
early
to
be
somewhere
a
little
early
unless
it
is
business
generated,
unless
it
also
goes
so
far
as
to
be
away
from
home
in
a
travel
status
would
not
come
onto
this
particular
route.
in
mr.
correll's
case,
he
was
fortunate
enough
not
only
be
required
to
get
up
by
his
employer,
excuse
me,
and
be
away
from
home
in
an
early
hour,
but
he
did
travel
approximately
50
miles
in
a
legitimate
travel
status
generated
for
business
reasons.
so
we
contend
that
that
is
a
clear
distinction
in
his
case
versus
the
example
which
you
get.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
something
like
that.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
your
honor,
i
have
to
answer
the
question
in
this
respect.
the
peculiar
facts
of
this
case
of
course,
would
determine
mr.
correll's
incidence
a
deductible
item.
however,
i
think
we
would
have
to
examine
each
case
up
on
its
own
facts
to
see
whether
or
not
each
of
these
men
we're
in
a
legitimate
travel
status.
the
point
which
has
been
made
by
the
petitioner
here
that
the
rule
that
each
case
must
determine
up
on
its
own
facts
is
not
workable
administratively.
then
in
effect
by
his
own
admission,
that
all
of
the
deduction
sections
in
the
internal
revenue
code
are
not
workable.
because
as
a
common
knowledge,
practically
every
code
when
interpreting
a
code
section
pertaining
to
especially
section
162
expenses.
they
have
premise
their
findings
that
it
is
always
based
upon
the
facts
of
each
individual
case.
and
i
do
not
see
how
did
that
within
itself
would
make
our
contentions
unworkable
as
far
as
the
commissioner
is
concerned.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
to
be
specific,
i
contend
that
each
individual
case
would
have
to
stand
up
on
its
own
facts
under
section
162(a)
(2).
i
think
that
the
implementation
of
this
section
is
further
made
easier
by
section
274
of
the
internal
revenue
code
wherein
certain
substantiation
of
business
generated
expenses
must
be
kept
according
to
records
and
receipts.
and
i
think
that
this
in
itself
indicates
that
congress
intended
that
all
of
these
expenses
would
have
to
rest
upon
their
own
facts.
and
i
think
that
the
very
essence
of
our
tax
administration
system
in
that
we
must
file
our
own
tax
return.
and
that
only
if
it's
audited
there's
the
question
come
up.
practically
speaking,
it
solves
your
problem
a
great
deal.
but
i
think
that
to
answer
specifically,
they
would
have
to
rest
up
on
its
own
facts.
i
think
that
perhaps
i
should
direct
a
few
remarks
to
the
case
of
bagley
which
was
decided
in
the
first
circuit
subsequently
to
the
decision
of
six
circuit
in
correll.
i
think
unquestionably
that
the
government's
contentions
carried
great
weight
with
justice
aldrich
his
decision
of
that
case.
however,
i
think
that
justice
aldrich
assumed
that
some
rule
had
to
be
established
and
since
the
sixth
or
the
eighth
circuits
actually
specified
in
so
many
words
a
clear
rule
other
than
what
statute
read,
they
as
a
matter
of
convenience
adopted
the
commissioner's
rule.
however,
for
the
sake
of
argument
here
today,
i'm
not
saying
that
the
commissioner's
rule
is
the
rule
of
convenience.
but
conceding
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
it
is,
it
is
at
the
respondent's
contention
that
even
if
it
is
the
most
workable
rule
that
is
possible,
without
an
expressed
authorization
in
section
162
as
to
sleep
or
rest
or
as
to
overnight
then,
i
do
not
believe
that
this
court
or
any
court
can
apply
just
because
it
is
administratively
convenient
because
the
law
does
not
specify.
it
does
not
give
the
commissioner
the
power
to
administer
such
a
rule.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
under
the
regulations
however,
the
commissioner
has
made
no
reference
to
the
overnight
rule.
in
the
substantive
regulations
under
section
162,
there
is
no
specification
that
the
overnight
rule
is
enforced
to
entitle
man
to
a
deduction.
there
are
other
references
to
it
in
the
administrative
regulations
pertaining
to
keeping
the
records
but
nowhere
in
the
substantive
portion
of
the
regulations
is
there
a
reference
to
the
overnight
rule.
i
think
that
was
pointed
out
in
the
tax
court's
opinion
in
bagley
which
by
the
way
reversed
as
the
petitioner
has
pointed
out,
reversed
a
very
long
standing
rule
of
the
tax
court,
and
rule
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer.
and
then
justice
aldrich
in
the
first
circuit
turned
it
around
again
and
put
it
back
in.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
except
that
you
use
the
word
“invalidate”
the
commissioner's
rule.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
have
to
admit
that
he
has
interpreted
this
for
a
number
of
years.
of
course,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
was
actually
law
or
should
be
law
is
another
matter
for
this
court
to
determine.
but
i
would
say
that
basically
our
rule
is
that
again
repeating
is
the
fact
that
we
must
ascertain
whether
or
not
it
is
a
legitimate
travel
status.
and
it
was
generated
for
business
purposes.
and
that
the
expenses
were
incurred
away
from
home
which
in
mr.
correll's
case,
we
contend
was
clearly
the
case.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
i
think
that
that
was
the
intent
--
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
taxpayer
by
taxpayer,
all
of
each
individual
return.
mr.
william
a.
taylor
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
very
nature
of
the
trial
and
whether
or
not,
he
is
generated
for
business
purposes
throughout
the
code
sections
is
constant.
they're
constantly
setting
up
circumstances
where
the
facts
of
each
case
must
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
a
business
deduction.
and
we
contend
that
that
is
a
reasonable
rule
and
it's
a
rule
which
has
been
enforced
since
the
revenue
code
has
been
adopted.
in
closing,
the
respondent
would
like
to
urge
this
court
to
adopt
the
rule
of
the
legitimate
trial
status
because
we
contend
that
this
rule
is
founded
in
the
statute.
that
this
rule
was
distinguished
between
the
commuter
who
comes
from
his
home
in
connecticut
to
the
new
york
city
in
his
office,
and
the
man
who
gets
on
a
jet
liner
and
flies
from
new
york
to
chicago
and
has
lunch
and
comes
back.
or
it
would
distinguish
between
a
situation
of
mr.
correll's
one
day
travel
where
his
expenses
are
generated
for
business
purposes.
and
we
believe
that
this
rule
does
not
involve
an
artificial
construction
of
section
162
wherein
the
word
“overnight”
or
sleep
or
rest
is
superimposed
in
that
section.
and
by
virtue
of
this,
that
the
code
section
would
be
construed
and
it's
clear,
and
it's
an
ambiguous
meaning,
and
thereby
would
be
according
to
the
intent
of
congress.
thank
you.
