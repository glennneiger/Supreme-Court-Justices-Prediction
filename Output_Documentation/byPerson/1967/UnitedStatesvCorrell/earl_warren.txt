chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
taylor,
when
you
said
that
he
was
required
to
have
breakfast
with
his
customers,
you
mean
that
he
was
required
to
actually
have
breakfast
with
them
or
just
to
eat
at
one
of
those
places
of
business.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
this
--
does
that
mean
that
he
was
to
sit
down
and
actually
have
breakfast
with
the
customer
or
just
at
his
place
of
business?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
now,
supposed
he
wanted
to
wake
his
wife
up
at
4:30
or
5
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
have
her
prepare
breakfast,
could
he
have
done
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
he
still
have
to
let
his
wife
sleep,
is
that
the
reason
that
he
go
for
an
hour
before
he
had
his
breakfast?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
that
a
vital
thing,
the
hour
that
he
did
this
because
we
have
some
business
places
that
go
around
the
clock
with
some
men
or
to
work
at
midnight.
and
if
he
chose
to
--
if
that
man
going
to
work
at
midnight
chose
to
eat
in
the
restaurant
rather
than
to
have
his
wife
cook
the
meal
for
him
at
midnight,
that
should
be
taken
as
factors.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
taylor,
pursuing
mr.
justice
stewart's
questions
a
little
further,
do
you
contend
that
you're
entitled
to
judgment
just
because
of
these
specific
facts
that
applied
to
this
specific
sales?
or
do
you
feel
that
the
other
17
salesmen,
i
understood
they're
18
or
something
like
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
have
different
routes
and
different
customers
started
at
a
little
different
time
and
so
forth,
would
be
--
do
you
contend
that
they
would
be
coming
out
of
the
blanket
too
or
do
you
think
that
this
should
be
differentiated
from
each
of
those
other
men
because
of
the
peculiar
facts
of
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
i
--
what
i
was
interested
in
is
this,
what
did
under
your
theory
would
the
commissioner
have
to
determine
that
each
case
standing
up
on
this
particular
facts
and
given
the
fact
that
we
have
hundreds
of
thousands
maybe
millions
of
people
who
commute
each
day.
some
of
them
30,
40,
50
miles
each
way
and
they
eat
on
the
train
or
coming
to
work,
or
they
eat
at
the
restaurant
when
they
get
there
rather
than
disturb
their
household
with
their
children
and
their
wives
early
in
the
morning.
now,
he
has
to
consider
whether
they
came
20
miles
or
30
miles
or
where
they
went
to
work
at
9
o'clock
or
went
to
work
at
6
o'clock
or
whatever
it
might
be?
do
you
think
that
that's
a
workable
rule
that
we
would
have
to
whether
we
should
have
them
consider?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
giving
the
part
to
issue
regulations
so
that
shifting
to
the
administration.
