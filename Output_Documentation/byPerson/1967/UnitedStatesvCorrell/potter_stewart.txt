i
suppose
if
we
had
only
section
162
alone,
somebody
who
commuted
to
wall
street
say
from
west
district
county
or
new
jersey
or
connecticut
or
long
island
and
had
lunch
down
there
would
be
able
to
do
that,
in
fact
even
the
commuter
would,
wouldn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
or
as
justice
white
suggests
it
might
depend
upon
the
definition
of
the
word
“home”
when
you're
down
at
wall
street
and
have
lunch,
you're
not
away
from
home.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
rely
in
this
case
on
a
particular
fact
of
your
case,
the
fact
that
your
client
was
required
by
his
employer
to
eat
at
these
specific
places
or
are
you
making
a
general
attack
upon
the
commissioner's
rest
or
sleep
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
trying
to
win
your
case
on
how
you
can,
i
know
that.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
hadn't
understood
--
hadn't
understood
in
reading
your
brief
that
you
were
relying
on
a
particular
specific
perhaps
peculiar
facts
of
your
case
in
so
far
as
your
client
was
required
by
his
employer
to
have
his
lunch
and
his
breakfast
at
particular
places.
i
don't
understand
that
you
make
any
claim
that
it
was
any
more
expensive
for
example.
justice
potter
stewart
for
him
to
have
lunch
or
breakfast
there
than
it
would
have
been
anywhere
else
than
any
normal
place.
justice
potter
stewart
whatever
the
day
is,
that
if
he
is
away,
it's
the
entire
amount.
justice
potter
stewart
the
earlier
rule
at
least
asserted
by
the
commissioner
was
that
only
part
that
represented
the
difference
between
what
he
spent
when
he
was
away
and
what
he
would
have
spent
when
he
was
at
home
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that's
out
of
the
picture,
now
it
has
been
since
1921.
justice
potter
stewart
i
believe
there's
no
dispute
about
that,
but
you're
not
in
this
case
planning
that
the
places
where
this
man
did
in
fact
have
breakfast
and
lunch
cost
and
to
pay
anymore
money
than
he
would
have
paid
--
justice
potter
stewart
--here
any
other
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
place
that
he
might
go.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
so.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
mr.
taylor;
in
answer
to
my
earlier
questioning
your
position
would
be
this.
but
first
of
all,
you'll
have
to
persuade
the
court
to
invalidate
the
previous
very
well
settled
overnight
rule
or
to
be
a
little
more
accurate
to
the
sleep
or
rest
rule
because
until
that's
invalidated,
you
can't
possibly
win.
and
only
if
it's
invalidated,
can
you
win.
but
even
after
it's
invalidated,
then
you
have
to
go
along
--
on
and
say
that
in
your
particular
case,
judge
done
its
particular
facts,
these
are
business
expenses
and
not
personal
expenses.
then
that's
the
reason
i
expected
to
emphasize
the
particular
facts
of
your
case.
but
it's
a
two-strip
argument
that
you
necessarily
have
to
make
i
suppose,
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
a
well
settled
practice
that
needs
to
have
been
settled
in
1962
was
the
earliest.

clearly
was
not.
