mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
suppose
there's
a
little
need
to
remind
the
court
that
the
issue
involved
here
is
the
same
one
that
was
before
the
court
in
four
local
government
cases
last
term.
the
government
participated
amicus
in
those
cases
and
we
continue
our
participation
here
because
we
feel
that
the
case
involves
the
question
that's
of
fundamental
importance
to
our
democratic
society.
essentially
the
question
of
ensuring
fair
and
full
participation
at
all
levels
of
government
for
all
people.
initially
and
just
in
passing,
i'd
like
to
mention
a
jurisdictional
issue
that
was
raised
at
one
point
in
this
case.
as
we
understand
it,
the
respondents
at
the
petition
stage
question
whether
there
was
a
final
judgment
in
this
case.
we
developed
some
pages
in
our
brief
to
this
question.
we
think
that
it's
clear
that
the
texas
supreme
court's
judgment
was
a
final
one
both
under
texas
law
and
under
this
court's
precedence.
and
that
therefore,
the
court's
certiorari
jurisdiction
was
invoked,
properly
invoked.
now,
it's
clear
that
the
texas
supreme
court
did
remand
case
to
the
trial
court
but
the
remand
was
very
limited
one.
it
was
for
entry
of
a
judgment
in
accordance
with
the
opinion.
and
we
feel
that
it's
also
clear
that
the
texas
supreme
court
did
pass
on
the
federal
constitutional
issue
that
was
raised
and
then
of
course,
is
essential
that
this
court
exercise
of
jurisdiction
because
the
texas
supreme
court
stated
and
held
that
the
equal
protection
clause
did
not
require
population-based
districting
in
midland
county,
texas.
that
was
in
the
face
of
a
trial
court
judgment
which
had
ordered
the
commissioners
to
redistrict
on
a
basis
of
population.
so,
we
think
it's
clear
that
this
court's
jurisdiction
is
properly
invoked
and
that
there
was
a
final
judgment
despite
the
limited
remand.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that's
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
first,
they
spend
an
awful
lot
of
time
in
their
brief
upon
the
merits
arguing
that
that
was
not
the
kind
of
plan
that
was
suitable
in
midland
county.
and
second,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
anything
is
clear
from
the
texas
supreme
court's
opinion,
it
is
that
the
equal
population
principle
of
reynolds
should
not
be
applied
at
least
in
this
county.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
they
could
satisfy
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
i
don't
think
you
misread
the
opinion
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
texas
supreme
court
made
it
clear
that
it
did
not
think
that
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
federal
constitution
required
the
one
man,
one
vote
rule
–
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
it
was
writing
that
opinion
in
the
context
of
the
case
involving
midland
county,
this
county.
and
it
said
that,
other
factors
should
be
taken
into
account.
now,
as
we
point
out,
i
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
could
be
taken
into
account.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
and
i
think
that
if
there's
any
realistic
possibility
that
the
midland
county
commissioners
might
be
thought
to
--
upon
remand
to
take
into
account
these
factors
and
yet,
say,
they
all
work
out
so
that
population
ought
to
be
the
standard
if
there's
a
realistic
possibility
of
that
that's
there's
a
cause
of
concern.
but
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it
rejected
it
as
applied
to
midland
county
texas.
otherwise,
it
would
have
affirmed
the
judgment
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
--
but
this
is
against
the
background
of
a
trial
court
decision
in
order
requiring
that
the
district
can
be
on
a
population
basis.
we
pointed
out
on
our
brief
that
the
factors
that
texas
supreme
court
enumerates
to
be
taken
into
account
either
cut
in
favor
of
the
people
that
live
in
the
city
or
they're
the
kind
of
factors
that
the
court
in
reynolds
versus
sims
held
were
not
properly
to
be
taken
into
account.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
that
they
would
be
reversed
again.
and
i
think
it's
also
pretty
clear
that
commissioners
aren't
going
to
do
anything
like
that
anyhow.
i
think
in
the
main
that
we
should
leave
the
question
of
the
powers
and
the
functions
and
the
duties
of
this
board
of
the
parties
who
are
in
a
position
to
know
far
better
than
the
government
exactly
how
this
particular
body
functions.
we
do
point
out
that
the
body
does
have
a
general
taxing
authority
overall
the
people
in
the
county
whether
they
live
in
the
city
or
out
in
the
rural
areas,
and
that
they
have
a
power
of
equalizing
tax
assessment,
determining
what
value
is
to
be
placed
on
property
and
that
there
is
some
indication
in
the
record
that
this
particular
power
has
been
used
and
certainly
at
least
can
be
used
in
the
future
of
use.
should
point
out
i
think
that
the
argument
and
the
discussion
this
morning,
i
think,
points
out
to
our
way
of
thinking
the
basic
utility
of
pursuing
some
kind
of
distinction
based
upon
whether
the
body
is
legislative
or
administrative
or
something
else.
i
just
don't
think
that
that's
a
meaningful
way
to
pursue
the
inquiry.
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
we
don't
think
that
reynolds
versus
sims
and
the
other
cases
were
grounded
on
anything
that
was
peculiar
to
state
legislatures
as
distinguished
from
other
kinds
of
representative
bodies.
gray
versus
sanders
was
mentioned
this
morning.
that
case
didn't
involve
legislative
officers
and
yet
the
court
applied
the
equal
protection
clause
there.
for
practical
reasons,
however,
we
think
that
the
distinction
is
just
an
illusory
one.
what
this
kind
of
bodies
and
this
is
a
typical
one.
some
have
more
extensive
powers,
some
have
less.
i
suppose
that
--
and
we
mentioned
that
perhaps
a
de
minimis
rule
could
be
evolved
as
to
some
of
these
bodies
that
they
don't
do
important
or
significant
things.
and
that
they
would
be
said
not
to
be
within
the
principle.
but
when
a
body
has
a
general
taxing
authority
over
the
people
and
it
has
a
number
of
other
important
functions,
the
matter
in
which
they're
exercised
and
what
kind
of
label
or
characterization
might
be
placed
on
them
whether
legislative
or
administrative,
or
what,
it
seems
to
us
to
introduce
into
our
courts
and
almost
never
ending
inquiry
as
to
how
to
do
this?
what
attributes
do
you
focus
upon?
and
finally,
i'm
not
convinced
that
even
if
the
judiciary
spends
the
time
in
this
inquiry,
the
results
will
be
meaningful
or
coherent
and
of
course,
this
court
will
be
in
a
position
of
trying
to
give
some
consistency
and
some
coherence
to
these
distinctions.
and
therefore,
we
developed
that
greater
length
in
our
brief
that
we
don't
think
a
legislative
administrative
line
distinction
is
a
feasible
one
or
a
justifiable
one.
one
might
say,
“well,
let's
just
find
out
how
the
board
functions.
does
it
enact
to
ordinances?
and
if
it
does
then,
that's
a
lawmaking
kind
of
function.
why
don't
we
say
that's
the
test?”
well,
we
think
that
whether
a
body,
the
local
level
has
a
power
to
enact
to
ordinances
or
not,
it
depends
so
much
on
the
vagaries
of
state
law
that
you
had
--
if
you
focus
on
this,
you
would
have
attached
to
own
that
would
not
produce
sensible
or
meaningful
results.
and
therefore,
we
feel
that
the
power
to
enact
ordinance
is
the
form
through
which
the
body
acts
is
not
a
--
should
not
be
a
determined
one.
we
also
should
point
out
that
in
suggesting
that
a
legislative,
administrative
line
of
distinction
not
be
drawn
as
to
the
applicability
of
reynolds
at
the
local
level.
we
don't
mean
that
all
distinction
should
be
cast
aside.
it
seems
to
us,
first,
that
if
some
such
line
is
going
to
be
drawn,
perhaps
a
better
focus
would
be
on
whether
the
body
is
a
policy
making
body
or
whether
it
is
essentially
is
ministerial
in
character.
this
is
a
line
of
distinction
that
has
been
worked
out
to
some
extent
in
some
state
as
the
municipal
law
matter.
we
don't
think
that
that
would
be
--
that's
much
easier
to
apply
but
at
least
i
think
it
might
focus
on
the
importance
and
the
independence
and
whatever
of
the
particular
body.
we
also
suggest
and
develop
at
some
length
what
we
consider
to
be
a
significant
and
important
consideration
that
stems
from
reynolds
versus
sims.
and
that
is
this,
that
reynolds
versus
sims
assumes
since
it's
grounded
on
the
equal
protection
clause
and
grounded
on
the
protection
of
the
individual's
right
to
cast
an
equally
weighted
vote
that
all
citizens
are
situated
in
a
substantially
similar
way,
insofar
as
their
state
legislature
is
concerned.
now,
this
is
a
traditional
except
that
equal
protection
clause
concept
that
classifications
are
valid
if
people
are
situated
in
a
substantially
different
way
but
classifications
are
not
valid
if
people
are
not
and
discrimination
comes
in.
now,
we
suggest
that
at
least
just
to
some
so-called
special
districts
and
by
this
act
mean
sewage
and
drainage
and
conservancy
districts,
bodies
that
in
the
main
are
set
up
to
perform
a
single
function
and
yet
under
the
laws
of
some
states
are
--
have
a
body
that
is
elected
by
the
people
from
districts.
that
it
may
be
that
the
equal
protection
clause
and
reynolds
versus
sims
do
not
require
equal
districting
because
the
nature
and
the
function
of
what
this
particular
body
does,
does
not
relate
generally
to
all
of
the
people.
it
relates
to
this
certain
discrete
identifiable
classes
of
people.
now,
it
may
be
difficult
to
apply
this
in
some
cases,
we
refer
to
in
passing
a
couple
of
arizona
statutes
that
relates
to
drainage
districts
several.
they
even
point
out
there
that
the
drainage
district
governing
board
is
elected
from
districts
but
those
districts
are
based
on
land
area
instead
on
people.
but
it
seems
to
us
that
that
may
be
a
sensible
line
of
distinction
because
the
functions
that
those
bodies
apparently
perform
relate
directly
and
specifically
to
only
those
people
in
their
own
land
to
be
drained.
it
seems
to
us
though
that
you
can
push
this
too
far.
if
the
body
nevertheless
has
a
general
taxing
power
and
can
affect
importantly
the
lives
of
all
the
people
in
the
area,
then
i
don't
think
that
we
would
carry
this
line
of
distinction
and
that
before
we
but
suggest
then
the
people
are
basically
situated
in
a
similar
way.
this
is
a
tough
line
of
distinction.
it
seems
to
us
that
it's
a
pertinent
consideration
in
deciding,
how
and
when,
and
where,
and
why
reynolds
versus
sims
should
be
applied
at
the
local
level.
now,
this
immediately
raises
the
question
and
i
think
that
it's
fairly
presented
by
the
texas
supreme
court's
opinion.
why
shouldn't
this
apply
to
general
function
units,
this
line
of
distinction?
you
say
that
people
are
not
similarly
situated
whether
the
rural
and
the
urban
people
here
are
similarly
situated.
and
our
answer
would
be,
yes,
that
they
are
in
this
situation
would
apply
almost
across
the
board
to
all
general
function
units.
here,
we
suggest
they're
similarly
situated
because
this
body
does
have
powers
and
does
exercise
functions
that
affect
all
of
them
in
an
important
way.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
rather
hoary
motto
“no
taxation
without
representation”
is
not
to
be
so
likely
cast
aside.
if
the
body
can
tax
these
people
and
can
use
this
money
in
ways
that
it
sees
fit,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
those
people
wherever
they
live
in
the
area,
whether
they
live
in
the
city
or
out
in
the
rural
areas,
have
an
important
and
substantial
interest.
one
might
say,
okay,
they
have
an
important
and
substantial
interest
but
it
is
--
it
is
so
important
and
so
substantial
that
they
have
to
be
given
equality
in
the
weight
of
their
vote.
well,
i
don't
think
that
that
is
unnecessary
and
indispensable
constitutional
requisite
but
as
a
practical
matter,
i
don't
think
that
it
can
be
worked
out
in
any
other
way.
now,
this
sounds
harsh
but
it
seems
to
us
at
some
states
have
adjusted
to
this
situation.
our
own
experience
right
across
the
river
in
virginia
indicates
that
independent
cities
can
be
created
and
established.
and
in
there,
if
the
particular
state
feels
that
this
problem
that
we
refer
to
is
overlapped
in
jurisdiction,
it's
a
difficult
one
their
ways
available
in
the
political
and
legislative
process
to
deal
with
it.
but,
we
think
that
it's
quite
clear
that
as
to
this
kind
of
body
whether
you
call
it
legislative
or
whatever,
it
does
things
that
affect
the
people
that
live
in
midland
in
an
important
way.
now,
i'd
like
to
discuss
in
passing
at
least
some
of
the
arguments
that
are
made
against
defining
reynolds
versus
sims
at
the
local
level.
some
people
say
states
have
a
plenary
power
over
local
bodies.
they
can
create
them
or
do
a
way
with
them
or
do
whatever
they
want.
well,
that's
--
that's
true
but
that
doesn't
carry
today.
all
that
we
suggest
here,
is
that
whether
the
state
creates
local
bodies
whose
members
are
to
be
elected
from
districts,
those
districts
are
required
under
the
equal
protection
clause
to
be
substantially
put
in
population.
some
people
say
they
just
so
many
of
these
bodies
that
the
thing
is
unmanageable.
we
pointed
out
that
the
bureau
of
census
indicates
there's
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
90,000
of
these
bodies.
a
recent
publication,
they
put
this
out
every
five
years,
indicates
that
the
number
has
been
reduced
to
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
80,000.
as
you've
pointed
out,
that
almost
all
of
the
reduction
indeed
more
than
the
difference
in
the
reduction
is
in
consolidated
school
districts.
we
suggested
last
term
that
is
insofar
as
the
principle,
we
suggest
to
be
applied
that
it
would
affect
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
20,000
of
these
bodies.
we
think,
however,
that
while
there
are
a
large
number
of
these,
the
principle
is
manageable.
the
court
is
not
writing
on
a
blank
sheet
here.
we
pointed
out
and
discussed
at
length
that
seven
state
courts
of
last
resort
have
already
applied
the
population
principle
to
local
bodies.
and
this
includes
states
like
new
york
and
california,
the
two
largest
states
in
our
country.
these
states
of
this
state
court
of
last
resort
have
found
that
these
are
full
and
practicable
to
handle
this.
indeed
in
one
of
the
cases,
the
wisconsin
case,
there
was
a
state
statute
that
was
involved
and
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
pointed
out
that
its
decision
would
have
of
course
affect
in
one
stroke
all
of
the
counties
in
the
state
rather
than
to
have
litigation
as
to
each
and
everyone.
now,
we
feel
that
for
the
reasons
developed
more
fully
and
what
we
refer
to
this
is
our
sailors
brief
of
last
term
that
the
matter
is
a
manageable
one.
we
think
that
this
is
confirmed
by
this
court's
decisions
in
bianchi
and
moody
cases
last
term
which
the
court
held
that
three-judge
courts
would
not
be
required
in
the
federal
system
in
most
of
these
situations
since
the
involved
statutes
of
limited
applicability.
we
also
note
that
the
court
in
the
opinions
written
last
term
express
to
concern
with
innovation
and
experimentation
at
the
local
level
and
of
the
state
for
interfering
with
that.
we
think
that
is
well-advised
if
we
don't
think
that
the
rule
of
applying
reynolds
at
the
local
level
will
do
a
way
with
innovation
and
experimentation.
most
of
these
malapportioned
situations
have
not
come
about
through
experimentation
or
innovation.
they've
come
about
through
a
resistance
to
change.
the
trial
court
here
pointed
out
that
and
made
a
finding
that
the
purpose
behind
this
scheme
was
political
expediency
to
maintain
the
status
quo.
that
was
true
in
the
state
cases
and
that's
true
at
the
local
level.
and
we
think
that
it
would
be
a
rather
plural
irony
of
experimentation
and
innovation
were
used
to
uphold
the
schemes
on
the
hope
that
someday
this
would
develop.
we
think
also
that
it's
quite
clear
that
the
court
hasn't
resolved
the
question
presented
here
and
yet,
we
keep
running
into
tedesco
and
cases
like
that.
we've
explained
in
our
brief
the
limited
significance
in
our
view
of
pre-baker
decisions.
we
also
pointed
out
that
the
several
per
curiam
decisions
not
on
the
merits
involving
local
government
are
certainly
not
controlling
either
otherwise
a
lot
of
us
would
have
been
wasting
a
lot
of
time.
last
term's
decisions
it
seems
to
me
deserve
comment
but
to
it
we
handle
on
jurisdictional
grounds,
we
think
that
has
absolutely
no
effect.
the
other
two
cases
sailors
and
dusch,
the
virginia
beach
case,
you
indicate
that
in
the
particular
and
peculiar
circumstances
involved
there,
the
court
didn't
feel
that
the
equal
protection
clause
apply
to
require
equally
populated
districts.
but
in
sailors,
the
court
pointed
out
that
there
wasn't
even
elective
scheme.
the
court
focused
on
the
system
for
determining
county
school
board
members
and
said
that
that
was
in
an
appointive
system
and
also
pointed
out
that
at
least
to
non-legislative
offices
such
an
appointive
system
was
valid.
but
here
we
have
an
election
system,
so
no
question
can
be
raised
about
that
decision
controlling.
also
in
the
virginia
beach
case,
we
had
a
large
election
scheme,
here
we
don't.
we
have
an
election
from
districts.
i
think
it's
clear
also
that
whatever
else
might
be
said
about
the
virginia
beach
decision,
we
pointed
out
at
some
length
our
concern
for
that
decision
being
applied
sweepingly
and
across
the
board.
but
whatever
might
be
said
about
it,
it
doesn't
have
any
bearing
here.
i'd
like,
in
conclusion,
to
refer
just
in
passing
to
what
we
consider
apart
from
a
legal
argument
some
policy
considerations
that
are
quite
important
here.
we,
of
course,
don't
need
to
be
told
that
this
is
a
time
of
crisis
in
our
governmental
institution
as
the
demands
on
government
have
never
been
as
great
and
this
includes
the
local
level.
and
it
seems
to
us
if
our
society,
our
system,
is
to
meet
the
demands
or
urbanization
and
population
growth,
we
need
responsive
and
viable
local
instruments
of
government.
now,
it's
also
clear
that
malapportionment
impairs
the
effectiveness
of
the
bodies
to
operate
in
a
responsive
way
and
to
a
deal
with
the
problems
and
the
needs
of
the
citizens.
we
think
that
this
is
particularly
so
as
to
local
bodies.
they
touch
and
involve
people
in
the
most
direct
way.
for
many
people
they
are
the
government
because
they
deal
with
those
problems
that
people
are
most
concerned
about,
local
taxation
and
zoning,
and
the
condemnation,
and
things
like
that.
and
we
think
it's
also
quite
clear
that
if
malapportionment
at
the
local
level
continues,
some
of
the
bright
promise
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
might
well
be
deemed.
therefore,
in
our
view,
these
policy
considerations
combine
with
what
we
feel
to
be
logical
and
sound
constitutional
principles
to
argue
in
favor
of
applying
the
equal
population
principle
of
reynolds
at
the
local
level.
we
submit,
therefore,
that
since
texas
supreme
court
under
our
reading
of
its
opinion
rejected
the
application
of
the
equal
population
principle
that
its
decision
was
wrong,
and
therefore,
ought
to
be
reversed.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it
is
of
some
significance,
your
honor.
this
court
has
consistently
paid
attention
to
the
state
law
determinations
and
statements
of
state
courts.
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
seems
to
us
as
mr.
olson
pointed
out
that
that
statement
was
made
in
passing
and
it
was
made
in
the
face
of
a
vast
array
of
statutes
which
confer
on
this
body
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
suggest
that
it
should
have
no
impact
if
it's
clear
that
the
body
still
has
important
powers
and
functions
over
the
people
that
live
in
the
city.
i
think
that
that's
entitled
to
wait
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
has
never
counted
so
bound
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
that's
pushing
it.
i
don't
think
you
generally
going
to
find
that
situation
but
if
you
isolate
that
one
aspect,
i
would
think
so.
i
would
think
that
that
need
not
necessarily
follow
in
all
cases
if
you
could
seize
upon
some
sensible
way
to
work
this
out.
maybe
a
computer
could
do
it.
you've
weighed
to
be
different
but
i
don't
think
the
mind
of
man
or
a
judge
would
be
able
to.
thank
you.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
suppose
there's
a
little
need
to
remind
the
court
that
the
issue
involved
here
is
the
same
one
that
was
before
the
court
in
four
local
government
cases
last
term.
the
government
participated
amicus
in
those
cases
and
we
continue
our
participation
here
because
we
feel
that
the
case
involves
the
question
that's
of
fundamental
importance
to
our
democratic
society.
essentially
the
question
of
ensuring
fair
and
full
participation
at
all
levels
of
government
for
all
people.
initially
and
just
in
passing,
i'd
like
to
mention
a
jurisdictional
issue
that
was
raised
at
one
point
in
this
case.
as
we
understand
it,
the
respondents
at
the
petition
stage
question
whether
there
was
a
final
judgment
in
this
case.
we
developed
some
pages
in
our
brief
to
this
question.
we
think
that
it's
clear
that
the
texas
supreme
court's
judgment
was
a
final
one
both
under
texas
law
and
under
this
court's
precedence.
and
that
therefore,
the
court's
certiorari
jurisdiction
was
invoked,
properly
invoked.
now,
it's
clear
that
the
texas
supreme
court
did
remand
case
to
the
trial
court
but
the
remand
was
very
limited
one.
it
was
for
entry
of
a
judgment
in
accordance
with
the
opinion.
and
we
feel
that
it's
also
clear
that
the
texas
supreme
court
did
pass
on
the
federal
constitutional
issue
that
was
raised
and
then
of
course,
is
essential
that
this
court
exercise
of
jurisdiction
because
the
texas
supreme
court
stated
and
held
that
the
equal
protection
clause
did
not
require
population-based
districting
in
midland
county,
texas.
that
was
in
the
face
of
a
trial
court
judgment
which
had
ordered
the
commissioners
to
redistrict
on
a
basis
of
population.
so,
we
think
it's
clear
that
this
court's
jurisdiction
is
properly
invoked
and
that
there
was
a
final
judgment
despite
the
limited
remand.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that's
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
first,
they
spend
an
awful
lot
of
time
in
their
brief
upon
the
merits
arguing
that
that
was
not
the
kind
of
plan
that
was
suitable
in
midland
county.
and
second,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
anything
is
clear
from
the
texas
supreme
court's
opinion,
it
is
that
the
equal
population
principle
of
reynolds
should
not
be
applied
at
least
in
this
county.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
they
could
satisfy
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no.
i
don't
think
you
misread
the
opinion
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
texas
supreme
court
made
it
clear
that
it
did
not
think
that
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
federal
constitution
required
the
one
man,
one
vote
rule
–
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
it
was
writing
that
opinion
in
the
context
of
the
case
involving
midland
county,
this
county.
and
it
said
that,
other
factors
should
be
taken
into
account.
now,
as
we
point
out,
i
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
could
be
taken
into
account.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
and
i
think
that
if
there's
any
realistic
possibility
that
the
midland
county
commissioners
might
be
thought
to
--
upon
remand
to
take
into
account
these
factors
and
yet,
say,
they
all
work
out
so
that
population
ought
to
be
the
standard
if
there's
a
realistic
possibility
of
that
that's
there's
a
cause
of
concern.
but
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it
rejected
it
as
applied
to
midland
county
texas.
otherwise,
it
would
have
affirmed
the
judgment
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but
--
but
this
is
against
the
background
of
a
trial
court
decision
in
order
requiring
that
the
district
can
be
on
a
population
basis.
we
pointed
out
on
our
brief
that
the
factors
that
texas
supreme
court
enumerates
to
be
taken
into
account
either
cut
in
favor
of
the
people
that
live
in
the
city
or
they're
the
kind
of
factors
that
the
court
in
reynolds
versus
sims
held
were
not
properly
to
be
taken
into
account.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
that
they
would
be
reversed
again.
and
i
think
it's
also
pretty
clear
that
commissioners
aren't
going
to
do
anything
like
that
anyhow.
i
think
in
the
main
that
we
should
leave
the
question
of
the
powers
and
the
functions
and
the
duties
of
this
board
of
the
parties
who
are
in
a
position
to
know
far
better
than
the
government
exactly
how
this
particular
body
functions.
we
do
point
out
that
the
body
does
have
a
general
taxing
authority
overall
the
people
in
the
county
whether
they
live
in
the
city
or
out
in
the
rural
areas,
and
that
they
have
a
power
of
equalizing
tax
assessment,
determining
what
value
is
to
be
placed
on
property
and
that
there
is
some
indication
in
the
record
that
this
particular
power
has
been
used
and
certainly
at
least
can
be
used
in
the
future
of
use.
should
point
out
i
think
that
the
argument
and
the
discussion
this
morning,
i
think,
points
out
to
our
way
of
thinking
the
basic
utility
of
pursuing
some
kind
of
distinction
based
upon
whether
the
body
is
legislative
or
administrative
or
something
else.
i
just
don't
think
that
that's
a
meaningful
way
to
pursue
the
inquiry.
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
we
don't
think
that
reynolds
versus
sims
and
the
other
cases
were
grounded
on
anything
that
was
peculiar
to
state
legislatures
as
distinguished
from
other
kinds
of
representative
bodies.
gray
versus
sanders
was
mentioned
this
morning.
that
case
didn't
involve
legislative
officers
and
yet
the
court
applied
the
equal
protection
clause
there.
for
practical
reasons,
however,
we
think
that
the
distinction
is
just
an
illusory
one.
what
this
kind
of
bodies
and
this
is
a
typical
one.
some
have
more
extensive
powers,
some
have
less.
i
suppose
that
--
and
we
mentioned
that
perhaps
a
de
minimis
rule
could
be
evolved
as
to
some
of
these
bodies
that
they
don't
do
important
or
significant
things.
and
that
they
would
be
said
not
to
be
within
the
principle.
but
when
a
body
has
a
general
taxing
authority
over
the
people
and
it
has
a
number
of
other
important
functions,
the
matter
in
which
they're
exercised
and
what
kind
of
label
or
characterization
might
be
placed
on
them
whether
legislative
or
administrative,
or
what,
it
seems
to
us
to
introduce
into
our
courts
and
almost
never
ending
inquiry
as
to
how
to
do
this?
what
attributes
do
you
focus
upon?
and
finally,
i'm
not
convinced
that
even
if
the
judiciary
spends
the
time
in
this
inquiry,
the
results
will
be
meaningful
or
coherent
and
of
course,
this
court
will
be
in
a
position
of
trying
to
give
some
consistency
and
some
coherence
to
these
distinctions.
and
therefore,
we
developed
that
greater
length
in
our
brief
that
we
don't
think
a
legislative
administrative
line
distinction
is
a
feasible
one
or
a
justifiable
one.
one
might
say,
“well,
let's
just
find
out
how
the
board
functions.
does
it
enact
to
ordinances?
and
if
it
does
then,
that's
a
lawmaking
kind
of
function.
why
don't
we
say
that's
the
test?”
well,
we
think
that
whether
a
body,
the
local
level
has
a
power
to
enact
to
ordinances
or
not,
it
depends
so
much
on
the
vagaries
of
state
law
that
you
had
--
if
you
focus
on
this,
you
would
have
attached
to
own
that
would
not
produce
sensible
or
meaningful
results.
and
therefore,
we
feel
that
the
power
to
enact
ordinance
is
the
form
through
which
the
body
acts
is
not
a
--
should
not
be
a
determined
one.
we
also
should
point
out
that
in
suggesting
that
a
legislative,
administrative
line
of
distinction
not
be
drawn
as
to
the
applicability
of
reynolds
at
the
local
level.
we
don't
mean
that
all
distinction
should
be
cast
aside.
it
seems
to
us,
first,
that
if
some
such
line
is
going
to
be
drawn,
perhaps
a
better
focus
would
be
on
whether
the
body
is
a
policy
making
body
or
whether
it
is
essentially
is
ministerial
in
character.
this
is
a
line
of
distinction
that
has
been
worked
out
to
some
extent
in
some
state
as
the
municipal
law
matter.
we
don't
think
that
that
would
be
--
that's
much
easier
to
apply
but
at
least
i
think
it
might
focus
on
the
importance
and
the
independence
and
whatever
of
the
particular
body.
we
also
suggest
and
develop
at
some
length
what
we
consider
to
be
a
significant
and
important
consideration
that
stems
from
reynolds
versus
sims.
and
that
is
this,
that
reynolds
versus
sims
assumes
since
it's
grounded
on
the
equal
protection
clause
and
grounded
on
the
protection
of
the
individual's
right
to
cast
an
equally
weighted
vote
that
all
citizens
are
situated
in
a
substantially
similar
way,
insofar
as
their
state
legislature
is
concerned.
now,
this
is
a
traditional
except
that
equal
protection
clause
concept
that
classifications
are
valid
if
people
are
situated
in
a
substantially
different
way
but
classifications
are
not
valid
if
people
are
not
and
discrimination
comes
in.
now,
we
suggest
that
at
least
just
to
some
so-called
special
districts
and
by
this
act
mean
sewage
and
drainage
and
conservancy
districts,
bodies
that
in
the
main
are
set
up
to
perform
a
single
function
and
yet
under
the
laws
of
some
states
are
--
have
a
body
that
is
elected
by
the
people
from
districts.
that
it
may
be
that
the
equal
protection
clause
and
reynolds
versus
sims
do
not
require
equal
districting
because
the
nature
and
the
function
of
what
this
particular
body
does,
does
not
relate
generally
to
all
of
the
people.
it
relates
to
this
certain
discrete
identifiable
classes
of
people.
now,
it
may
be
difficult
to
apply
this
in
some
cases,
we
refer
to
in
passing
a
couple
of
arizona
statutes
that
relates
to
drainage
districts
several.
they
even
point
out
there
that
the
drainage
district
governing
board
is
elected
from
districts
but
those
districts
are
based
on
land
area
instead
on
people.
but
it
seems
to
us
that
that
may
be
a
sensible
line
of
distinction
because
the
functions
that
those
bodies
apparently
perform
relate
directly
and
specifically
to
only
those
people
in
their
own
land
to
be
drained.
it
seems
to
us
though
that
you
can
push
this
too
far.
if
the
body
nevertheless
has
a
general
taxing
power
and
can
affect
importantly
the
lives
of
all
the
people
in
the
area,
then
i
don't
think
that
we
would
carry
this
line
of
distinction
and
that
before
we
but
suggest
then
the
people
are
basically
situated
in
a
similar
way.
this
is
a
tough
line
of
distinction.
it
seems
to
us
that
it's
a
pertinent
consideration
in
deciding,
how
and
when,
and
where,
and
why
reynolds
versus
sims
should
be
applied
at
the
local
level.
now,
this
immediately
raises
the
question
and
i
think
that
it's
fairly
presented
by
the
texas
supreme
court's
opinion.
why
shouldn't
this
apply
to
general
function
units,
this
line
of
distinction?
you
say
that
people
are
not
similarly
situated
whether
the
rural
and
the
urban
people
here
are
similarly
situated.
and
our
answer
would
be,
yes,
that
they
are
in
this
situation
would
apply
almost
across
the
board
to
all
general
function
units.
here,
we
suggest
they're
similarly
situated
because
this
body
does
have
powers
and
does
exercise
functions
that
affect
all
of
them
in
an
important
way.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
rather
hoary
motto
“no
taxation
without
representation”
is
not
to
be
so
likely
cast
aside.
if
the
body
can
tax
these
people
and
can
use
this
money
in
ways
that
it
sees
fit,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
those
people
wherever
they
live
in
the
area,
whether
they
live
in
the
city
or
out
in
the
rural
areas,
have
an
important
and
substantial
interest.
one
might
say,
okay,
they
have
an
important
and
substantial
interest
but
it
is
--
it
is
so
important
and
so
substantial
that
they
have
to
be
given
equality
in
the
weight
of
their
vote.
well,
i
don't
think
that
that
is
unnecessary
and
indispensable
constitutional
requisite
but
as
a
practical
matter,
i
don't
think
that
it
can
be
worked
out
in
any
other
way.
now,
this
sounds
harsh
but
it
seems
to
us
at
some
states
have
adjusted
to
this
situation.
our
own
experience
right
across
the
river
in
virginia
indicates
that
independent
cities
can
be
created
and
established.
and
in
there,
if
the
particular
state
feels
that
this
problem
that
we
refer
to
is
overlapped
in
jurisdiction,
it's
a
difficult
one
their
ways
available
in
the
political
and
legislative
process
to
deal
with
it.
but,
we
think
that
it's
quite
clear
that
as
to
this
kind
of
body
whether
you
call
it
legislative
or
whatever,
it
does
things
that
affect
the
people
that
live
in
midland
in
an
important
way.
now,
i'd
like
to
discuss
in
passing
at
least
some
of
the
arguments
that
are
made
against
defining
reynolds
versus
sims
at
the
local
level.
some
people
say
states
have
a
plenary
power
over
local
bodies.
they
can
create
them
or
do
a
way
with
them
or
do
whatever
they
want.
well,
that's
--
that's
true
but
that
doesn't
carry
today.
all
that
we
suggest
here,
is
that
whether
the
state
creates
local
bodies
whose
members
are
to
be
elected
from
districts,
those
districts
are
required
under
the
equal
protection
clause
to
be
substantially
put
in
population.
some
people
say
they
just
so
many
of
these
bodies
that
the
thing
is
unmanageable.
we
pointed
out
that
the
bureau
of
census
indicates
there's
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
90,000
of
these
bodies.
a
recent
publication,
they
put
this
out
every
five
years,
indicates
that
the
number
has
been
reduced
to
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
80,000.
as
you've
pointed
out,
that
almost
all
of
the
reduction
indeed
more
than
the
difference
in
the
reduction
is
in
consolidated
school
districts.
we
suggested
last
term
that
is
insofar
as
the
principle,
we
suggest
to
be
applied
that
it
would
affect
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
20,000
of
these
bodies.
we
think,
however,
that
while
there
are
a
large
number
of
these,
the
principle
is
manageable.
the
court
is
not
writing
on
a
blank
sheet
here.
we
pointed
out
and
discussed
at
length
that
seven
state
courts
of
last
resort
have
already
applied
the
population
principle
to
local
bodies.
and
this
includes
states
like
new
york
and
california,
the
two
largest
states
in
our
country.
these
states
of
this
state
court
of
last
resort
have
found
that
these
are
full
and
practicable
to
handle
this.
indeed
in
one
of
the
cases,
the
wisconsin
case,
there
was
a
state
statute
that
was
involved
and
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
pointed
out
that
its
decision
would
have
of
course
affect
in
one
stroke
all
of
the
counties
in
the
state
rather
than
to
have
litigation
as
to
each
and
everyone.
now,
we
feel
that
for
the
reasons
developed
more
fully
and
what
we
refer
to
this
is
our
sailors
brief
of
last
term
that
the
matter
is
a
manageable
one.
we
think
that
this
is
confirmed
by
this
court's
decisions
in
bianchi
and
moody
cases
last
term
which
the
court
held
that
three-judge
courts
would
not
be
required
in
the
federal
system
in
most
of
these
situations
since
the
involved
statutes
of
limited
applicability.
we
also
note
that
the
court
in
the
opinions
written
last
term
express
to
concern
with
innovation
and
experimentation
at
the
local
level
and
of
the
state
for
interfering
with
that.
we
think
that
is
well-advised
if
we
don't
think
that
the
rule
of
applying
reynolds
at
the
local
level
will
do
a
way
with
innovation
and
experimentation.
most
of
these
malapportioned
situations
have
not
come
about
through
experimentation
or
innovation.
they've
come
about
through
a
resistance
to
change.
the
trial
court
here
pointed
out
that
and
made
a
finding
that
the
purpose
behind
this
scheme
was
political
expediency
to
maintain
the
status
quo.
that
was
true
in
the
state
cases
and
that's
true
at
the
local
level.
and
we
think
that
it
would
be
a
rather
plural
irony
of
experimentation
and
innovation
were
used
to
uphold
the
schemes
on
the
hope
that
someday
this
would
develop.
we
think
also
that
it's
quite
clear
that
the
court
hasn't
resolved
the
question
presented
here
and
yet,
we
keep
running
into
tedesco
and
cases
like
that.
we've
explained
in
our
brief
the
limited
significance
in
our
view
of
pre-baker
decisions.
we
also
pointed
out
that
the
several
per
curiam
decisions
not
on
the
merits
involving
local
government
are
certainly
not
controlling
either
otherwise
a
lot
of
us
would
have
been
wasting
a
lot
of
time.
last
term's
decisions
it
seems
to
me
deserve
comment
but
to
it
we
handle
on
jurisdictional
grounds,
we
think
that
has
absolutely
no
effect.
the
other
two
cases
sailors
and
dusch,
the
virginia
beach
case,
you
indicate
that
in
the
particular
and
peculiar
circumstances
involved
there,
the
court
didn't
feel
that
the
equal
protection
clause
apply
to
require
equally
populated
districts.
but
in
sailors,
the
court
pointed
out
that
there
wasn't
even
elective
scheme.
the
court
focused
on
the
system
for
determining
county
school
board
members
and
said
that
that
was
in
an
appointive
system
and
also
pointed
out
that
at
least
to
non-legislative
offices
such
an
appointive
system
was
valid.
but
here
we
have
an
election
system,
so
no
question
can
be
raised
about
that
decision
controlling.
also
in
the
virginia
beach
case,
we
had
a
large
election
scheme,
here
we
don't.
we
have
an
election
from
districts.
i
think
it's
clear
also
that
whatever
else
might
be
said
about
the
virginia
beach
decision,
we
pointed
out
at
some
length
our
concern
for
that
decision
being
applied
sweepingly
and
across
the
board.
but
whatever
might
be
said
about
it,
it
doesn't
have
any
bearing
here.
i'd
like,
in
conclusion,
to
refer
just
in
passing
to
what
we
consider
apart
from
a
legal
argument
some
policy
considerations
that
are
quite
important
here.
we,
of
course,
don't
need
to
be
told
that
this
is
a
time
of
crisis
in
our
governmental
institution
as
the
demands
on
government
have
never
been
as
great
and
this
includes
the
local
level.
and
it
seems
to
us
if
our
society,
our
system,
is
to
meet
the
demands
or
urbanization
and
population
growth,
we
need
responsive
and
viable
local
instruments
of
government.
now,
it's
also
clear
that
malapportionment
impairs
the
effectiveness
of
the
bodies
to
operate
in
a
responsive
way
and
to
a
deal
with
the
problems
and
the
needs
of
the
citizens.
we
think
that
this
is
particularly
so
as
to
local
bodies.
they
touch
and
involve
people
in
the
most
direct
way.
for
many
people
they
are
the
government
because
they
deal
with
those
problems
that
people
are
most
concerned
about,
local
taxation
and
zoning,
and
the
condemnation,
and
things
like
that.
and
we
think
it's
also
quite
clear
that
if
malapportionment
at
the
local
level
continues,
some
of
the
bright
promise
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
might
well
be
deemed.
therefore,
in
our
view,
these
policy
considerations
combine
with
what
we
feel
to
be
logical
and
sound
constitutional
principles
to
argue
in
favor
of
applying
the
equal
population
principle
of
reynolds
at
the
local
level.
we
submit,
therefore,
that
since
texas
supreme
court
under
our
reading
of
its
opinion
rejected
the
application
of
the
equal
population
principle
that
its
decision
was
wrong,
and
therefore,
ought
to
be
reversed.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it
is
of
some
significance,
your
honor.
this
court
has
consistently
paid
attention
to
the
state
law
determinations
and
statements
of
state
courts.
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
seems
to
us
as
mr.
olson
pointed
out
that
that
statement
was
made
in
passing
and
it
was
made
in
the
face
of
a
vast
array
of
statutes
which
confer
on
this
body
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
suggest
that
it
should
have
no
impact
if
it's
clear
that
the
body
still
has
important
powers
and
functions
over
the
people
that
live
in
the
city.
i
think
that
that's
entitled
to
wait
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
has
never
counted
so
bound
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
that's
pushing
it.
i
don't
think
you
generally
going
to
find
that
situation
but
if
you
isolate
that
one
aspect,
i
would
think
so.
i
would
think
that
that
need
not
necessarily
follow
in
all
cases
if
you
could
seize
upon
some
sensible
way
to
work
this
out.
maybe
a
computer
could
do
it.
you've
weighed
to
be
different
but
i
don't
think
the
mind
of
man
or
a
judge
would
be
able
to.
thank
you.
