mr.
olson
chief
justice
earl
warren
900
acres?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
olson,
may
i
just
refer
for
a
moment
to
the
budgetary
and
the
taxation
functions
of
the
board.
do
i
understand
that
the
board
has
the
power
and
complications
to
fix
the
amount
of
the
budget,
the
number
of
dollars
that
are
to
be
spent
for
all
county
purposes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
do
--
do
i
understand
also
that
they
have
the
authority
to
determine
how
that
money
is
to
be
expended
for
what
purpose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
do
i
understand
that
they
fix
the
rate
at
which
this
money
is
to
be
collected.
in
other
words,
your
state
constitution
says
that
a
tax
cannot
exceed
$1
per
$100.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
say
that
it
must
be
20,
30,
or
40
cents
on
a
$100
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
whatever
it
may
take.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
do
they
also
have
the
final
authority
for
determining
all
values
of
personal
and
real
property
in
the
county?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
they
have
the
authority
then
to
determine
how
much
the
city
property
shall
be
evaluated
that
and
how
much
the
county
property
may
evaluate
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
very
well.
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
olson,
who
administers
the
welfare
programs
of
the
county?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
all
over
the
county?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
most
of
the
metropolitan
area
of
the
city,
in
the
boundaries
of
the
city
or
is
there
a
suburban
area
of
the
constitution?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
happen
to
know
in
1960
what
the
actual
population
of
midland
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
i
was
going
to
ask
was
how
much
was
in
the
city
and
how
much
was
suburban?
in
that
metropolitan
area,
do
you
happen
to
know
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
control
the
subdivision
of
land?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
explain
that
just
a
little
because
as
i
thought
--
i
understood
you
say
that
they
didn't
have
the
power
to
zone
but
now
you
say
they
have
the
power
to
control
subdivision
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
what
way,
mr.
olson?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
you
answer
that
after
we
have
the
recess.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
beytagh?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
browder.
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
the
other
hand,
might
you
not
have
the
situation
where
one
of
your
billion-acre
ranches
down
there
controls
the
entire
county?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
the
district
court
supervise
the
fixing
of
the
budget?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
can
say
that
they
have
appropriated
too
much
money
or
having
appropriated
enough?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
didn't
have
elective
system
then
the
court
held,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
can't
even
vote
unless
there's
a
tie,
can
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
accept
the
principle
of
reynolds
versus
sims
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
do
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
want
to
know
what
your
position
is,
you're
trying
to
tell
us
what
reynolds
versus
sims
means.
you're
trying
to
tell
us
how
the
supreme
court
of
texas
applied.
now,
are
you
going
to
accept
the
principle
of
reynolds
versus
sims
or
are
you
saying
you're
not
bound
by
it?
one
of
the
two,
i
think
you
got
to
do.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
do
argue
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
let
me
ask
you
what
you
conceive
the
basis
of
the
supreme
court
decision.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
they
did
accept
the
principle
of
reynolds
versus
sims.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
that
that
is
a
departure
from
reynolds
versus
sims
or
as
you
said
a
little
while
ago
as
i
understood
you
that
that
was
in
conformity
with
reynolds
versus
sims.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
feel
that
the
supreme
court
of
texas
intended
to
conform
to
the
principle
of
reynolds
versus
sims?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'm
not
accusing
you.
well,
i
did
understand
you
to
say
to
mr.
justice
black
that
you
did
concede
that
the
population
would
have
to
be
the
predominant
feature
or
the
reorganization
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yeah.
and
you
argue
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
with
not
you're
--
not
with
no
consideration
but
it
should
that
be
predominant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
and
what
do
you
think
your
court
demands?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
wouldn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
it
could
subordinate
population
to
these
other
things.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
done
here
of
course
but
as
you
say,
that
has
been
described
by
your
court.
chief
