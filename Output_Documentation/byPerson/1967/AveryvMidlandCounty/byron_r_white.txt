justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
the
supreme
court
of
texas
specifically
improve
that
a
particular
apportionment
that
was
in
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
it
say
the
existing
apportionment
was
alright?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
home
rules
down
in
texas
in
the
sense
that
the
city
of
midland
is
an
independent
district?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
county
board
has
no
jurisdiction
over
the
areas
in
midland?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
don't
they
just
have
to
take
the
--
don't
they
just
have
to
take
the
amount
of
money
--
what
the
city
says
about
that,
about
the
tax
rates?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
say
the
city
says,
we
need
x
dollars
for
the
property
tax.
now,
is
the
county
commissioners
that
say
--
the
county
board
says,
“oh!
we're
sorry,
but
you're
not
going
to
get
x
dollars
from
the
property
tax.”
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
so
they
levy
there
--
they
levy
their
own
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
but
the
tax,
the
county
levies
his
--
applies
to
the
city?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
city
--
city
property
is
taxed?
justice
byron
r.
white
establishment
of
tax
values?
i
thought
that
would
be
by
a
tax
assessor?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
runs
the
school
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
school
board
--
is
that
a
separate
administrative
structure?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
sewers?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
sewers
and
plants?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
a
home
rule
--
you
say,
a
home
rule
in
midland
doesn't
mean
much
if
the
county
can
perform
all
these
municipal
services
inside
the
city
to
the
extent
--
override
what
the
city
wants
to
do,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
parks?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
they
have
a
county
park?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
county
headquarters
in
midland?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
there
is
county
office
building
in
there
that's
the
courthouse?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
they
have
a
police
force?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
county
have
a
police
force
or
a
sheriff?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
does
he
operate
out
of
the
city?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
need
for
law
enforcement
jurisdiction
inside
the
city?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
the
city
council
admit
on
there
whatever
it
is
wants
to
establish
a
library
and
since
there
ought
to
be
--
it
ought
be
on
the
west
side
of
town
and
the
county
commissioners
--
the
county
court
thinks
that
there
ought
to
be
a
library
there
but
it
ought
to
be
on
the
east
side
of
town,
who
wins?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
liquor
licenses?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
have
--
don't
you
have
liquor
license
in
texas?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
should
go?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
county
will
have
--
does
the
county
have
anything
to
do
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
texas
has
local
options,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
make
it
all
the
way
down
the
precinct,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
isn't
it
critical
to
your
position
that
there
--
that
the
members
of
the
county
court
are
elected?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
state
that
provide
for
the
appointment
by
the
governor,
the
members
of
this
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
beytagh,
what
do
you
do
with
the
supreme
court
of
texas
finding
although
theoretically
the
board
of
county
has
general
jurisdiction
at
the
matter
of
actual
experience
down
to
the
areas
of
the
county
board
really
is
governing
body
for
the
rural
area
rather
than
the
urban
area,
if
the
urban
runs
itself?
is
that
of
any
significance
to
the
states
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that
statement
we
refer
that
the
other
gentlemen
was
justly
passing
remark
they
have
minimal
authorities
that
on
--
if
later
in
the
opinion,
the
court
had
some
at
considerably
more
at
length
says
that
the

that
the

court
has
limited
its
major
responsibilities
to
the
non-urban
areas
in
the
county,
that's
a
practical
matter
experience.
that's
the
way
they
operate.
and
that
the
city
government
takes
care
of
its
own
concern.
now,
let's
assume
that
were
true
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
texas,
would
you
still
--
what
would
you
say
that
has
no
--
should
had
no
impact
on
the
apportionment
of
the
standards?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
that
it's
enough
that
as
long
as
the
county
board
actually
taxes
city
people
that
that
in
itself
is
enough
to
say
that
the
equal
population
principle
applies
to
the
local
even
if
99%
of
its
functions
are
concerned
with
the
rural
areas
alone?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
that
the
--
i
gather
that
you
think
that
if
the
--
that
part
of
that
the
supreme
court
remanded
to
let
the
county
commissioners
court
redistrict
and
that
the
--
they
came
back
with
a
population-based
plan
with
the
--
is
it
possible
the
supreme
court
will
approve
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
court
below
did
say
that
there
were
other
factors
which
you
would
testify
deviation
from
the
population
principle.
that
makes
it
clear
as
been
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
but
it
did
--
but
i
gather
it
said
or
incurred
that
if
these
other
factors
were
present,
the
population-based
plan
would
be
plan
would
be
fully
satisfactory.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
otherwise,
the
non-population
base
plan
would
be
arbitrary?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
can't
have
separate
ones.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
succeeded
in
showing
discrimination.
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
supreme
court
of
texas
and
that
court
has
set
aside
your
present
districting.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
the
present
status
of
the
case.
so
what
did
you
mean
he's
failed
to
show
discrimination
and
if
so,
in
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
pannill
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
difficulties
with
that
is
that
the
texas
constitution
seems
to
intervene
in
this
argument
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
there
isn't
very
much
of
texas
legislature
whether
it's
malapportioned
or
not
can
do
about
what
the
powers
of
the
county
court
are
or
of
cities
either.
these
are
controlled
in
the
constitution,
i
take
it,
and
the
composition
of
this
county
court
is
controlled
by
the
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
there
are
four
people
and
they
have
certain
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
the
statute
required
four
separate
precincts?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
do
the
constitution
requires,
four
precincts?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
within
the
present
constitutional
provisions
for
example,
the
county
court
could
follow
the
sailors
or
the
dusch
scheme.
they
could
say
we're
going
to
have
certain
precincts
but
could
they
elect
at
large
--
could
they
elect
it
large
and
say
that
three
of
them
have
to
live
in
the
city
and
one
of
them
in
the
country?
justice
byron
r.
white
sometime
in
your
argument,
i
hope
you
will
suggest
why
the
dusch's
formula
for
inserting
rural
voice
by
means
of
elect
of
large
with
the
resident's
requirement
wouldn't
satisfy,
wouldn't
satisfy
the
needs
for
rural
representation
in
midland
county,
texas?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course
the
texas
is
certainly
--
if
texas
--
if
the
supreme
court
is
right
that
the
county
board
has
more
to
do
with
the
country
than
with
the
city,
as
a
matter
of
actual
operation
and
wholly
aside
in
what
the
statute
say.
there's
certainly
would
seem
to
be
rational
basis
for
having
a
county
voice
on
the
board.
it
just
wouldn't
be
a
wholly
factious
thing
that
has
county
representation.
and
certainly
the
texas
could
adopt
the
--
i
mean
it's
free
to
try
to
adopt
anyway
the
sailors
or
the
dusch
scheme.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
be
somewhat
like
a
water
conservancy
district
or
something
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
something
of
that
nature?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
the
supreme
court
of
texas
specifically
improve
that
a
particular
apportionment
that
was
in
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
it
say
the
existing
apportionment
was
alright?
justice
byron

you

but
don't
they

what
the

many
do
the
constitution
requires,
four
precincts?
justice

white
i
take
it
that
within
the
present
constitutional
provisions
for
example,
the
county
court
could
follow
the
sailors
or
the
dusch
scheme.
they
could
say
we're
going
to
have
certain
precincts
but
could
they
elect
at
large
--
could
they
elect
it
large
and
say
that
three
of
them
have
to
live
in
the
city
and
one
of
them
in
the
country?
justice

sometime
in
your
argument,
i
hope
you
will
suggest
why
the
dusch's
formula
for
inserting
rural
voice
by
means
of
elect
of
large
with
the
resident's
requirement
wouldn't
satisfy,
wouldn't
satisfy
the
needs
for
rural
representation
in
midland
county,
texas?
justice

white
well,
of
course
the
texas
is
certainly
--
if
texas
--
if
the
supreme
court
is
right
that
the
county
board
has
more
to
do
with
the
country
than
with
the
city,
as
a
matter
of
actual
operation
and
wholly
aside
in
what
the
statute
say.
there's
certainly
would
seem
to
be
rational
basis
for
having
a
county
voice
on
the
board.
it
just
wouldn't
be
a
wholly
factious
thing
that
has
county
representation.
and
certainly
the
texas
could
adopt
the
--
i
mean
it's
free
to
try
to
adopt
anyway
the
sailors
or
the
dusch
scheme.
justice
byron

white
that
would
be
somewhat
like
a
water
conservancy
district
or
something
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
something
of
that
nature?
