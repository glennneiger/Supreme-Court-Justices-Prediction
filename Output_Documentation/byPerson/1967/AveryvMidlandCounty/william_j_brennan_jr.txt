mr.
olson,
what
part
do
you
think
in
the
supreme
court's
conclusion
was
played
by
what
it
says
speaking
of
the
commissioner
and
the
body,
its
legislative
functions
are
negligible
and
county
government
is
not
otherwise
comparable
with
the
legislature
of
the
state
or
the
federal
congress.
and
then
later,
that
theoretically
the
commissioners
court
is
the
governing
body,
it
represents
all
the
residents
both
urban
and
suburban
that
developments
during
the
year
have
greatly
narrowed
the
scope
of
the
functions
of
the
commissioners
court
and
limited
major
responsibilities
in
non-urban
areas.
it
has
come
to
pass
that
the
city
government
with
its
legislative
executive
and
judicial
branches
is
the
major
concern.
would
you
believe
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
you
don't
agree
with
the
statement
its
legislative
functions
are
negligible?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
raises
a
nice
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
the
supreme
court
of
texas
says
that
the
--
a
unit
of
texas
government
function
has
only
negligible
legislative
function,
how
much
may
we
go
behind
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
they
do
more
than
suggest,
may
they
actually
determine
where
a
new
road
shall
go?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
where
a
new
bridge
shall
go?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh!
would
that
include
the
city
as
well?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
city
as
well
as
the
county?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
noticed
page
15
of
your
appendix
mr.
olson.
the
commissioners
court
of

county
may
establish,
maintain,
and
operate
within
the
respective
county
free
library.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
they
establish
one
under
that
provision
in
the
city
of
midland?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
hospital?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
within
the
city
of
midland
as
well
as
outside?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

within
the
city
as

justice
william
j.
brennan,

that's
the
same
property.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
told
you
before
hand
that
only
be
permitted
to
tax,
would
you
still
take
that
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
involve
exclusively
legislative
by
the
relief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
think
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
they
can't
do
that
and
pay
much
attention
to
the
population
basis,
can
they?
i
think
you
told
us
that
it
might
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
is
if
they
took
two
precincts
in
the
city
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

they
have
seven
in
the
city
and
one
in
the
country?
