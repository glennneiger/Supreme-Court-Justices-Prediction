justice
abe
fortas
are
there
any
constables
in
the
city?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
a
--
what
you
call
i
think
that
constabulary
districts?
justice
abe
fortas
constable
districts
are
personally
defined
so
as
to
include
the
city?
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
constables
don't
serve
any
city?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
--
so
within
the
city
had
both
the
police
force
and
the
constable?
justice
abe
fortas
where
do
they
get
the
money
to
build
the
roads?
justice
abe
fortas
levied
by
the
county
commissioners?
justice
abe
fortas
levied
by
them.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
not
a
state
function,
it's
a
county
function?
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
see
if
i'm
clear
about
this,
the
county
commissioners
can
decide
to
build
a
road
from
point
a
to
point
b
within
the
county?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
they
can
go
ahead
and
is
--
levy
taxes.
the
proceeds
to
those
taxes,
these
property
taxes
use
them
to
construct
the
road.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
what
you're
telling
us?
justice
abe
fortas
a
self-contained
system?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
olson,
i
want
to
interrupt
you.
i
would
like
to
ask
you
that,
you
said
that
--
let's
take
approximately
$2
million
as
a
budget
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
i
suppose
a
tax
--
how
much
would
have
been
raised
by
taxes,
county
taxes
in
respect
to
that
budget?
are
they
about
the
same
or
--?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
can
you
give
you
us
some
idea
as
to
the
division
of
the
receipts
from
county
taxes
as
between
the
city
and
the
western
county?
justice
abe
fortas
you
would
get
it
at
that
way.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
way
of
getting
rough
approximation
of
the
budget?
how
much
of
the
budget
was
spent
within
the
city
limits
and
how
much
outside?
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
in
precincts
2,
3,
and
4,
there
is
none
of
the
--
even
the
outside
the
city
limits
metropolitan
area
of
midland,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
you
said
it's
located
inside
the
city?
justice
abe
fortas
but
mr.
olson,
if
you
turn
this
around
and
apply
what
you
have
just
said.
that
means
that
the
95%
of
the
votes
would
be
cast
by
people
within
precinct
number
1,
mostly
by
the
senate,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
97%.
now,
if
one
would
put
possibly
the
worst
construction
on
this,
it
might
lead
to
the
inability
of
people
in
the
county
to
get
roads
and
schools,
and
libraries,
and
restaurants.
in
other
words,
isn't
it
conceivable,
i
suppose
that
the
system
deliberately
designed
so
as
to
promote
the
development
of
the
entire
county
even
though
the
people
within
the
city
after
subsidizing
a
bit.
just
as
the
people
of
the
united
states,
i
suppose,
people
of
new
york
state
let's
say
do
subsidize
somewhat
federal
payments
that
go
to
the
development
of
the
--
of
a
less
developed
states
and
some
of
the
sovereign
states.
now,
i
suppose
that
this
is
--
could
be
said
to
be
conscious
policy
and
i
guess
the
question
which
you
are
pointing
out
to
us
is
whether
constitutional
principle
requires
that
this
system
for
the
subsidization,
if
you
wish,
of
the
rural
areas
at
the
expense
both
voting
and
financial
perhaps,
the
city
wether
that
system,
when
the
constitution
forbids
that
kind
of
system.
do
you
have
a
comment
on
what
i've
just
said?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
beytagh
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
think
that
we
understand
saying.
i
think
the
point
is
that,
we
are
in
the
business
of
forecasting
what
they're
going
to
do.
the
question
is
what
did
the
supreme
court
of
texas
tell
them
to
do?
and
i'm
impressed
rather
than
surprised
if
i
know
this
correctly
understood
your
characterization
of
the
court's
opinion
because
as
i
read
it,
the
supreme
court
of
texas
said
that
and
i
think
the
clearest
place
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
149
of
the
record
that
the
convenience
of
the
people
and
the
particular
circumstances
of
a
county
may
require
and
constitutionally
justify
a
rational
variance
from
the
quality
and
population
of
commissioners
precinct
from
the
basis
of
additional
relevant
factors
which
the
court
then
enumerates.
as
i
read
this,
the
texas
supreme
court
has
held,
number
one,
that
--
that's
in
the
first
full
paragraph
on
page
150,
it
is
held
that
there
is
obvious
arbitrariness
of
the
current
districting
order
because
of
the
great
malapportionment
of
the
commissioners
precincts
in
midland
county.
and
it's
held
that
this
is
malapportioned.
it
is
also
held,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
correct
way
to
go
about
this
is
to
start
with
the
one
man,
one
vote
principle
and
then
to
make
a
rational
variance
when
it
calls
rational
variance
were
indicated
by
the
--
were
required
by
particular
circumstances
in
county
on
factors
have
that
are
numerous.
do
you
agree
with
my
characterization
of
this
opinion
or
do
you
think
that
the
court
rejected
the
one
man,
one
vote
principle
totally
as
applied
here?
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
--
i
have
to
frankly
say
to
you
that
i
can
read
it
that
way.
i
don't
say
any
total
out
loud
rejection
of
that
principle,
although
i
do
think,
i
think
it
presents
a
sharp
issue
that
is
why
that
which
is
whether
there
can
be
a
departure
from
that
principle
taking
into
account
the
other
factors.
that's
a
different
thing
in
my
mind
in
what
you've
said.
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
that
as
far
as
these
arguments,
and
i
understand
this
that
the
supreme
court
not
entirely
clear.
and
you
--
i
don't
mind
the
opinion
the
way
you
do.
you
say
now
up
to
this
that
the
opinion
of
the
texas
supreme
court
merely
present
sends
the
case
back
for
redistricting
and
it
says,
the
only
inescapable
requirement
is
unless
being
discrimination,
fraud,
arbitrariness
or
due
to
some
discretion,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
not
the
way
i
read
it
because
that's
the
last
sentence
in
the
opinion
on
page
150
of
the
record.
and
what
the
court
says
is
the
following,
in
no
event
is
a
population
disparity
sustainable
against
a
showing
of
discrimination
for
arbitrariness
or
abuse
of
discretions.
and
then
on
preceding
tangible
record,
the
court
says
that,
“equal
rights
and
equal
protection
of
laws
require
equality
and
political
rights.
and
there
may
be
circumstances
under
which
the
quality
and
population
is
essential
to
equality
and
voting
rights.”
so
that
the
court
had
mention
there
are
situations,
i
read
this
and
it's
not
entirely
clear.
there
are
situations
in
which
there
has
to
be
mathematical
equation,
one
man,
one
vote.
then
it
goes
on
and
it
says,
i
see
it,
on
the
other
hand,
the
convenience
on
the
people
in
a
particular
circumstances
they
encountered
may
require
and
constitutionally
justify
a
rational
variance,
a
rational
variance
from
the
equality
and
population
and
the
commissioners
precincts,
upon
the
basis
of
additional,
relevant
factors
such
as
numbers
of
qualified
voters,
land
areas,
geography,
etcetera.
and
as
i
read
this,
it
seems
to
me
and
perhaps
you're
speaking
for
texas,
aren't
you
for
the
county,
aren't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
but
as
i
read
this
it
meant
that
the
basic
standard
was
population,
one
man,
one
vote
variations
are
possible
in
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
county
and
that
the
constitution
is
justifiable.
then
we
go
down
to
the
last
sentence,
“but
in
no
event
is
a
population
disparity
sustainable
against
the
showing
of
discrimination,
fraud
and
fairness
and
so
on,
that
you
think
it
means
something
different
than
you
write?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
then
and
what
goes
by
that
order
that
is
with
this
testimony
procedure
would
made
this
and
he
gave
him
undue
credit
for
and
perhaps
what
the
issue
before
us
is
whether
the
supreme
court's
ruling
that
there
may
be
a
variation
from
a
strict
population
of
standard
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
you
tell
me
permissible,
i
think
that
is
the
issue
here.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
you
know
what
you're
supposed
to
do
under
the
texas
supreme
court,
would
you
mind
telling
us?
tell
us
what
you're
supposed
to
in
mandate.
justice
abe
fortas
yes
i
think
i'm
with
you.
glad
to
find
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
still
with
you.
now,
will
you
go
on?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
problem
--
well,
the
problem
is
about
this
argument
as
i
see
it
is
that
this
commissioners
courts
are
not
to
create
creature
of
the
legislature
but
that
the
creature
of
the
constitution.
and
your
state
constitution
creates
this
commissioners
courts
and
it's
in
your
state
constitution
says
that
they
should
be
divided
into
precincts
and
that
state
constitution
says,
they
should
be
divided
at
the
four
commissioners
precincts.
and
the
state
constitution
as
your
legislature
says
that,
the
divisions
of
the
precinct
shall
be
made
by
the
commissioners
court
after
legislature.
i
suppose
as
far
as
the
legislature
however
ultimately
apportioned
it
might
be
does
not
have
the
power
to
overrule
the
commissioners
court
decision
with
respect
to
the
definition
or
division
of
the
county
and
the
precincts.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
exactly
what
we're
concerned
with
here.
the
judicial
power,
not
legislative
that
in
fact
the
legislature
here
may
be
precisely
apportioned
in
the
accordance
to
constitutional
requirements
where
it
doesn't
meet
the
necessities
of
the
situation,
i
suggest?
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
started
--
you're
precisely
about
--
you
started
off
that
way
and
then
we
asked
you
some
question
for
defense
and
wait
you
along
and
fought
for
it
until
i
hit
you
with
the
constitution?
justice
abe
fortas
what
would
you
do
about
the
city
council
of
a
--
say
new
york
city
and
suppose
it
has
a
counsel
or
los
angeles
with
budget
in
billions
in
dollars
ordinance
making
power,
police
force,
how
to
determine
where
the
people
or
instead
liberty
or
to
go
to
jail
within
certain
restrictions
and
in
effect,
perhaps,
it
would
be
unfair
to
say
the
powers
of
state
legislature
on
the
small
scale
in
a
restricted
area.
do
you
think
that
that
fits
within
your
category
of
state
legislature
for
this
purpose
or
is
it
something
that
this
doctrine
of
our
cases
should
not
reach?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'd
rather
understand
that
but
do
you
--
would
--
the
thrust
of
your
theory
carve
out
from
the
so-called
one
man,
one
vote
rule.
the
elected
city
counsel
or
city
like
new
york
or
los
angeles,
or
chicago?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
justice
abe
fortas
it
will
be
applicable
to
constables,
election
of
the
constables?
justice
abe
fortas
constable,
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
are
there
any
constables
in
the
city?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
a
--
what
you
call
i
think
that
constabulary
districts?
justice
abe
fortas
constable
districts
are
personally
defined
so
as
to
include
the
city?
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
constables
don't
serve
any
city?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
--
so
within
the
city
had
both
the
police
force
and
the
constable?
justice
abe
fortas
where
do
they
get
the
money
to
build
the
roads?
justice
abe
fortas
levied
by
the
county
commissioners?
justice
abe
fortas
levied
by
them.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
not
a
state
function,
it's
a
county
function?
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
see
if
i'm
clear
about
this,
the
county
commissioners
can
decide
to
build
a
road
from
point
a
to
point
b
within
the
county?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
they
can
go
ahead
and
is
--
levy
taxes.
the
proceeds
to
those
taxes,
these
property
taxes
use
them
to
construct
the
road.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
what
you're
telling
us?
justice
abe
fortas
a
self-contained
system?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
olson,
i
want
to

i
would
like
to
ask
you
that,
you
said
that
--
let's
take
approximately
$2

justice
abe
fortas

and
i

how

county

justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
in
precincts
2,
3,
and
4,
there
is
none
of
the
--
even
the
outside
the
city
limits
metropolitan
area
of
midland,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
you
said
it's
located
inside
the
city?
justice
abe
fortas
but
mr.
olson,
if
you
turn
this
around
and
apply
what
you

that
means
that

current
districting
order
because
of
the
great
malapportionment
of
the
commissioners
precincts
in
midland
county.
and
it's
held
that
this
is
malapportioned.
it
is
also
held,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
correct
way
to
go
about
this
is
to
start
with
the
one
man,
one
vote
principle
and
then
to
make
a
rational
variance
when
it
calls
rational
variance
were
indicated
by
the
--
were
required
by
particular
circumstances
in
county
on
factors
have
that
are
numerous.
do
you
agree
with
my
characterization
of
this
opinion
or
do
you
think
that
the
court
rejected
the
one
man,
one
vote
principle
totally
as
applied
here?
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
--
i
have
to
frankly
say
to
you
that
i
can
read
it
that
way.
i
don't
say
any
total
out
loud
rejection
of
that
principle,
although
i
do
think,
i
think
it
presents
a
sharp
issue
that
is
why
that
which
is
whether
there
can
be
a
departure
from
that
principle
taking
into
account
the
other
factors.
that's
a
different
thing
in
my
mind
in
what
you've
said.
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
that
as
far
as
these
arguments,
and
i
understand
this
that
the
supreme
court
not
entirely
clear.
and
you
--
i
don't
mind
the
opinion
the
way
you
do.
you
say
now
up
to
this
that
the
opinion
of
the
texas
supreme
court
merely
present
sends
the
case
back
for
redistricting
and
it
says,
the
only
inescapable
requirement
is
unless
being
discrimination,
fraud,
arbitrariness
or
due
to
some
discretion,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
not
the
way
i
read
it
because
that's
the
last
sentence
in
the
opinion
on
page
150
of
the
record.
and
what
the
court
says
is
the
following,
in
no
event
is
a
population
disparity
sustainable
against
a
showing
of
discrimination
for
arbitrariness
or
abuse
of
discretions.
and
then
on
preceding
tangible
record,
the
court
says
that,
“equal
rights
and
equal
protection
of
laws
require
equality
and
political
rights.
and
there
may
be
circumstances
under
which
the
quality
and
population
is
essential
to
equality
and
voting
rights.”
so
that
the
court
had
mention
there
are
situations,
i
read
this
and
it's
not
entirely
clear.
there
are
situations
in
which
there
has
to
be
mathematical
equation,
one
man,
one
vote.
then
it
goes
on
and
it
says,
i
see
it,
on
the
other
hand,
the
convenience
on
the
people
in
a
particular
circumstances
they
encountered
may
require
and
constitutionally
justify
a
rational
variance,
a
rational
variance
from
the
equality
and
population
and
the
commissioners
precincts,
upon
the
basis
of
additional,
relevant
factors
such
as
numbers
of
qualified
voters,
land
areas,
geography,
etcetera.
and
as
i
read
this,
it
seems
to
me
and
perhaps
you're
speaking
for
texas,
aren't
you
for
the
county,
aren't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
but
as
i
read
this
it
meant
that
the
basic
standard
was
population,
one
man,
one
vote
variations
are
possible
in
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
county
and
that
the
constitution
is
justifiable.
then
we
go
down
to
the
last
sentence,
“but
in
no
event
is
a
population
disparity
sustainable
against
the
showing
of
discrimination,
fraud
and
fairness
and
so
on,
that
you
think
it
means
something
different
than
you
write?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
then
and
what
goes
by
that
order
that
is
with
this
testimony
procedure
would
made
this
and
he
gave
him
undue
credit
for
and
perhaps
what
the
issue
before
us
is
whether
the
supreme
court's
ruling
that
there
may
be
a
variation
from
a
strict
population
of
standard
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
you
tell
me
permissible,
i
think
that
is
the
issue
here.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
you
know
what
you're
supposed
to
do
under
the
texas
supreme
court,
would
you
mind
telling
us?
tell
us
what
you're
supposed
to
in
mandate.
justice
abe
fortas
yes
i
think
i'm
with
you.
glad
to
find
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
still
with
you.
now,
will
you
go
on?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
problem
--
well,
the
problem
is
about
this
argument
as
i
see
it
is
that
this
commissioners
courts
are
not
to
create
creature
of
the
legislature
but
that
the
creature
of
the
constitution.
and
your
state
constitution
creates
this
commissioners
courts
and
it's
in
your
state
constitution
says
that
they
should
be
divided
into
precincts
and
that
state
constitution
says,
they
should
be
divided
at
the
four
commissioners
precincts.
and
the
state
constitution
as
your
legislature
says
that,
the
divisions
of
the
precinct
shall
be
made
by
the
commissioners
court
after
legislature.
i
suppose
as
far
as
the
legislature
however
ultimately
apportioned
it
might
be
does
not
have
the
power
to
overrule
the
commissioners
court
decision
with
respect
to
the
definition
or
division
of
the
county
and
the
precincts.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
exactly
what
we're
concerned
with
here.
the
judicial
power,
not
legislative
that
in
fact
the
legislature
here
may
be
precisely
apportioned
in
the
accordance
to
constitutional
requirements
where
it
doesn't
meet
the
necessities
of
the
situation,
i
suggest?
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
started
--
you're
precisely
about
--
you
started
off
that
way
and
then
we
asked
you
some
question
for
defense
and
wait
you
along
and
fought
for
it
until
i
hit
you
with
the
constitution?
justice
abe
fortas
what
would
you
do
about
the
city
council
of
a
--
say
new
york
city
and
suppose
it
has
a
counsel
or
los
angeles
with
budget
in
billions
in
dollars
ordinance
making
power,
police
force,
how
to
determine
where
the
people
or
instead
liberty
or
to
go
to
jail
within
certain
restrictions
and
in
effect,
perhaps,
it
would
be
unfair
to
say
the
powers
of
state
legislature
on
the
small
scale
in
a
restricted
area.
do
you
think
that
that
fits
within
your
category
of
state
legislature
for
this
purpose
or
is
it
something
that
this
doctrine
of
our
cases
should
not
reach?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'd
rather
understand
that
but
do
you
--
would
--
the
thrust
of
your
theory
carve
out
from
the
so-called
one
man,
one
vote
rule.
the
elected
city
counsel
or
city
like
new
york
or
los
angeles,
or
chicago?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
justice
abe
fortas
it
will
be
applicable
to
constables,
election
of
the
constables?
justice
abe
fortas
constable,
yes.
