justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
understand
the
--
or
maybe
i
misunderstood
but
i
--
it
is
not
been
my
misunderstanding
that
the
supreme
court
of
texas
had
held
that
that
provision
of
the
federal
constitution
is
not
applicable
to
midland
county,
texas
but
that
provision
of
constitution
required
was
not
what
you
said
it
required.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you
understand?
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
the
constabulary
boundaries?
what
does
that
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
the
constable
boundaries?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
--
the
counties
have
sheriffs?
justice
potter
stewart
are
they
elected?
justice
potter
stewart
or
appointed
by
the
county?
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
voting
at
large
within
the
county?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
eyes
of
the
city,
midland
--
midland
is
the
city
and
it
has
a
city
police
department,
i
assume.
justice
potter
stewart
pretty
well
policed.
justice
potter
stewart
the
supreme
court
opinion,
whereas
as
important
that
this
administrative
body
customizes
the
roads
and
bridges.
does
that
defines
with
the
permission
of
the
court
that
lays
out
where
the
roads
shall
be
and
lays
out
where
bridges
shall
be
or
is
it
just
that
this
is
a
responsibility
to
maintain
existing
roads
in
repair
or
bridges
or
which
or
which?
justice
potter
stewart
what
does
that
mean,
a
city
county
cooperative?
justice
potter
stewart
what
funds?
i
understood
you
say
at
the
out
set
that
the
county
commissioners
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
county
court
as
i
call
consisting
of
a
county
judgment
or
commissioner
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
is
involved
in
this
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
the
taxing
authority
for
the
entire
county
including
the
city?
justice
potter
stewart
the
city
has
its
own
court?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
city
has
its
own
power
to
tax?
justice
potter
stewart
do
all
of
the
funds
go
to
state
capital
and
then
get
returned
to
the
city
and
county?
justice
potter
stewart
city
sales
tax.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
--
and
a
resident
of
midland
pays
both
city
and
county
tax?
justice
potter
stewart
and
both
city
and
the
county
therefore
have
funds.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that's
okay.
justice
potter
stewart
actually,
gray
involved
a
supreme
court
judge
of
the
state.
justice
potter
stewart
that
case
involved
a
judicial
officer.
justice
potter
stewart
among
others,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
they
don't
have
any
legislative
power
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
although,
some
critics
say
otherwise.
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
on
my
part
or
on
the
part
of
your
texas
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
if
that
is
what
is
called
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
chairman
is
also
called
the
county
judge,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
does
it
have
anything
to
do
with
the
schools,
public
schools?
justice
potter
stewart
which
will
not
connect
within
the
city
or
the
county
government?
justice
potter
stewart
how
much
in
fact
--
how
much
a
function
do
these
county
officers
have
inside
the
city
limits?
i'm
talking
now
about
the
sheriff
and
the
deputy
as
distinguished
from
a
city
police
force
inside
the
city.
justice
potter
stewart
will
they
in
fact
exercise
it?
justice
potter
stewart
or
do
they
spend
most
of
their
time
to
perform
most
of
their
duties
that
are
outside
the
city
limits.
justice
potter
stewart
because
that
--
the
only
place
for
is
outside
the
city,
outside
of
the
texas
rangers
and
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
the
highway
patrol.
justice
potter
stewart
but
they're
the
only
local
police
outside
the
city?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
municipal
court
in
midland?
justice
potter
stewart
doesn't
it
have
court
officers
to
the
serve
process?
justice
potter
stewart
inside
the
city?
justice
potter
stewart
for
a
misconduct
inside
the
city?
justice
potter
stewart
that
part
which
is
outside,
that
is
the
suburbia
of
the
metropolitan
area,
is
that
all
in
one
other
precinct?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
all
--
justice
potter
stewart
all
at
number
one?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
townships
also?
justice
potter
stewart
you
got
--
what
are
called
east
townships
in
this
county?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
elsewhere
in
the
county,
you
have?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
beytagh
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
accepting
the
premise
that
you're
entirely
right
as
to
the
technical
question
of
jurisdiction.
there
still
remains,
does
there
not,
something
of
a
practical
problem
because
we
do
not
now
have
before
us
any
precinct
division
by
the
county
commissioners.
and
so
far
as
we
know,
the
commissioners
may
now
go
ahead
and
effectuate
and
putting
the
operation
a
planned
depended,
a
precinct
division
plan
depended
entirely
upon
population.
justice
potter
stewart
all
--
all
of
the
texas
i
have
in
mind
this
that
all
of
the
texas
supreme
court
said
was
that
in
its
opinion,
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
require
in
all
cases,
it
does
not
--
do
not
require
a
commissioners
precinct
division
of
texas
county
on
this
basis
in
all
cases
dependent
of
course,
in
each
case
upon
the
existence
and
effect
of
other
relevant
factors
such
as
those
that
we
have
mentioned.
and
the
commissioners
may
now
go
ahead
and
come
to
conclusion
that
those
other
relevant
factors
adding
them
all
up
on
that
bounds
come
out
so
that
they're
going
to
now
put
it
on
a
plan
dependent
entirely
on
population.
that
certainly
is
well
within
the
realm
of
possibility
as
a
practical
manner,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
not
that
--
i
thought
that
what
it
held
was
that
because
the
federal
constitution
does
not
require
in
every
single
case
of
each
of
the
254
texas
counties
that
reynolds
against
sims
be
slavishly
followed.
and
but
if
--
and
then
it
remanded
the
case
to
the
trial
court
which
in
turn
is
going
to
enter
a
judgment
consistent
without
opinion
which
will
simply
leave
them
with
the
commissioners
the
job
now
of
coming
up
with
the
new
plan
and
until
or
in
less
there's
a
new
plan,
what
do
we
--
how
do
we
know
what
the
new
plan
can
contain?
now,
this
is
quite
a
part
from
any
technical
concept
of
jurisdiction.
i'm
just
addressing
my
question
to
the
practical
problem.
we
don't
have
any
plan
in
front
of
us
now?
justice
potter
stewart
i
do
not
understand
that
the
texas
supreme
court
said
that
the
constitution
required
the
commissioners
to
consider
that.
i
thought
it
simply
said
they
might
consider
it
without
violating
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
do
i
misread
its
opinion?
justice
potter
stewart
and
flexibly
at
each
one
of
the
254
counties.
justice
potter
stewart
could
it
be
constitutionally
taken
into
account?
and
that
--
wasn't
that
what
they're
saying?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
the
present
situation,
it
is
that
you
use
to
have
the
situation
that
you
just
described
with
mr.
justice
black.
but
that
knowledge
you
have
is
an
order
of
the
supreme
court
of
texas
saying
and
i'm
quoting
that
there
is
obvious
arbitrariness
in
the
current
districting
order
because
of
the
shaded
malapportionment
of
the
commissioners
precincts
of
midland
county.
unless
you
can
now
have
that
set
aside
and
that
the
whole
thing
is
now
in
limbo,
a
new
determination
of
this
court
whether
or
not
we
agree
or
disagree
with
the
supreme
court
of
texas,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
we
couldn't
be
back
to
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
we
couldn't
be
back
to
this
unless
we
reverse
the
supreme
court
of
texas
instead
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
that
was
up
--
what
you
mean
up
to
them.
you
just
told
us
that
they
are
bound
by
what
the
supreme
court
of
texas
said.
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean,
you
certainly
can't
mean
that
the
supreme
court
of
texas
said,
“gentlemen,
it's
up
to
you.
you
do
whatever
you
want.”
justice
potter
stewart
then
what
do
you
understand
that
they
are
required
to
do,
whether
you
order
the
supreme
court
of
texas?
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
confer
it
before
you
and
you
say,
the
petitioners
failed
to
show
discrimination
and
now
failed
to
show
discrimination
in
what?
we
don't
have
any
districting
now
before
us.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
what
did
you
mean
when
you
said
he's
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
your
points
insofar
as
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
goes
in
this
area
that
so
long
as
you
have
a
legislature,
apportioned
in
accord
with
the
rule
of
reynolds
against
sims,
then
is
the
constitutional
matter
that
legislature
can
be
entrusted.
that
legislature
responsive
as
it
is
to
the
people
proportionally
and
equally.
it
can
be
trusted
constitutionally
to
delegate
its
power
such
part
of
its
power
wherever
it
wants
to.
does
that
it
--
that
if
the
majority
of
the
people
in
texas
with
a
precisely
apportioned
legislature
in
accordance
of
reynolds
against
sims
want
to
give
to
each
of
these
254
counties
this
that
of
the
other
power,
they
can
constitutionally
do
so
and
they
can
constitutionally
take
it
away,
and
can
be
trusted
to
take
it
away
with
the
legislature
responsive
to
the
rule
reynolds
against
sims?
that's
suppose
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
there
a
constitutional
danger
there
so
long
as
you
have
a
constitutionally
apportioned
basic
statewide
legislature?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
talking
about
the
an
equal
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
understand
the
--
or
maybe
i
misunderstood
but
i
--
it
is
not
been
my
misunderstanding
that
the
supreme
court
of
texas
had
held
that
that
provision
of
the
federal
constitution
is
not
applicable
to
midland
county,
texas
but
that
provision
of
constitution
required
was
not
what
you
said
it
required.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you
understand?
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
the
constabulary
boundaries?
what
does
that
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
the
constable
boundaries?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
--
the
counties
have
sheriffs?
justice
potter
stewart
are
they
elected?
justice
potter
stewart
or
appointed
by
the
county?
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
voting
at
large
within
the
county?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
eyes
of
the
city,
midland
--
midland
is
the
city
and
it
has
a
city
police
department,
i
assume.
justice
potter
stewart
pretty
well
policed.
justice
potter
stewart
the
supreme
court
opinion,
whereas
as
important
that
this
administrative
body
customizes
the
roads
and
bridges.
does
that
defines
with
the
permission
of
the
court
that
lays
out
where
the
roads
shall
be
and
lays
out
where
bridges
shall
be
or
is
it
just
that
this
is
a
responsibility
to
maintain
existing
roads
in
repair
or
bridges
or
which
or
which?
justice
potter
stewart
what
does
that
mean,
a
city
county
cooperative?
justice
potter
stewart
what
funds?
i
understood
you
say
at
the
out
set
that
the
county
commissioners
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
county
court
as
i
call
consisting
of
a
county
judgment
or
commissioner
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
is
involved
in
this
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
the
taxing
authority
for
the
entire
county
including
the
city?
justice
potter
stewart
the
city
has
its
own
court?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
city
has
its
own
power
to
tax?
justice
potter
stewart
do
all
of
the
funds
go
to
state
capital
and
then
get
returned
to
the
city
and
county?
justice
potter
stewart
city
sales
tax.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
--
and
a
resident
of
midland
pays
both
city
and
county
tax?
justice
potter
stewart
and
both
city
and
the
county
therefore
have
funds.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that's
okay.
justice
potter
stewart
actually,
gray
involved
a
supreme
court
judge
of
the
state.
justice
potter
stewart
that
case
involved
a
judicial
officer.
justice
potter
stewart
among
others,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
they
don't
have
any
legislative
power
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
although,
some
critics
say
otherwise.
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
on
my
part
or
on
the
part
of
your
texas
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
if
that
is
what
is
called
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
chairman
is
also
called
the
county
judge,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
does
it
have
anything
to
do
with
the
schools,
public
schools?
justice
potter
stewart
which
will
not
connect
within
the
city
or
the
county
government?
justice
potter
stewart
how
much
in
fact
--
how
much
a
function
do
these
county
officers
have
inside
the
city
limits?
i'm
talking
now
about
the
sheriff
and
the
deputy
as
distinguished
from
a
city
police
force
inside
the
city.
justice
potter
stewart
will
they
in
fact
exercise
it?
justice
potter
stewart
or
do
they
spend
most
of
their
time
to
perform
most
of
their
duties
that
are
outside
the
city
limits.
justice
potter
stewart
because
that
--
the
only
place
for
is
outside
the
city,
outside
of
the
texas
rangers
and
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
the
highway
patrol.
justice
potter
stewart
but
they're
the
only
local
police
outside
the
city?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
municipal
court
in
midland?
justice
potter
stewart
doesn't
it
have
court
officers
to
the
serve
process?
justice
potter
stewart
inside
the
city?
justice
potter
stewart
for
a
misconduct
inside
the
city?
justice
potter
stewart
that
part
which
is
outside,
that
is
the
suburbia
of
the
metropolitan
area,
is
that
all
in
one
other
precinct?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
all
--
justice
potter
stewart
all
at
number
one?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
townships
also?
justice
potter
stewart
you
got
--
what
are
called
east
townships
in
this
county?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
elsewhere
in
the
county,
you
have?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
beytagh
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
accepting
the
premise
that
you're
entirely
right
as
to
the
technical
question
of
jurisdiction.
there
still
remains,
does
there
not,
something
of
a
practical
problem
because
we
do
not
now
have
before
us
any
precinct
division
by
the
county
commissioners.
and
so
far
as
we
know,
the
commissioners
may
now
go
ahead
and
effectuate
and
putting
the
operation
a
planned
depended,
a
precinct
division
plan
depended
entirely
upon
population.
justice
potter
stewart
all
--
all
of
the
texas
i
have
in
mind
this
that
all
of
the
texas
supreme
court
said
was
that
in
its
opinion,
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
require
in
all
cases,
it
does
not
--
do
not
require
a
commissioners
precinct
division
of
texas
county
on
this
basis
in
all
cases
dependent
of
course,
in
each
case
upon
the
existence
and
effect
of
other
relevant
factors
such
as
those
that
we
have
mentioned.
and
the
commissioners
may
now
go
ahead
and
come
to
conclusion
that
those
other
relevant
factors
adding
them
all
up
on
that
bounds
come
out
so
that
they're
going
to
now
put
it
on
a
plan
dependent
entirely
on
population.
that
certainly
is
well
within
the
realm
of
possibility
as
a
practical
manner,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
not
that
--
i
thought
that
what
it
held
was
that
because
the
federal
constitution
does
not
require
in
every
single
case
of
each
of
the
254
texas
counties
that
reynolds
against
sims
be
slavishly
followed.
and
but
if
--
and
then
it
remanded
the
case
to
the
trial
court
which
in
turn
is
going
to
enter
a
judgment
consistent
without
opinion
which
will
simply
leave
them
with
the
commissioners
the
job
now
of
coming
up
with
the
new
plan
and
until
or
in
less
there's
a
new
plan,
what
do
we
--
how
do
we
know
what
the
new
plan
can
contain?
now,
this
is
quite
a
part
from
any
technical
concept
of
jurisdiction.
i'm
just
addressing
my
question
to
the
practical
problem.
we
don't
have
any
plan
in
front
of
us
now?
justice
potter
stewart
i
do
not
understand
that
the
texas
supreme
court
said
that
the
constitution
required
the
commissioners
to
consider
that.
i
thought
it
simply
said
they
might
consider
it
without
violating
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
do
i
misread
its
opinion?
justice
potter
stewart
and
flexibly
at
each
one
of
the
254
counties.
justice
potter
stewart
could
it
be
constitutionally
taken
into
account?
and
that
--
wasn't
that
what
they're
saying?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
the
present
situation,
it
is
that
you
use
to
have
the
situation
that
you
just
described
with
mr.
justice
black.
but
that
knowledge
you
have
is
an
order
of
the
supreme
court
of
texas
saying
and
i'm
quoting
that
there
is
obvious
arbitrariness
in
the
current
districting
order
because
of
the
shaded
malapportionment
of
the
commissioners
precincts
of
midland
county.
unless
you
can
now
have
that
set
aside
and
that
the
whole
thing
is
now
in
limbo,
a
new
determination
of
this
court
whether
or
not
we
agree
or
disagree
with
the
supreme
court
of
texas,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
we
couldn't
be
back
to
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
we
couldn't
be
back
to
this
unless
we
reverse
the
supreme
court
of
texas
instead
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
that
was
up
--
what
you
mean
up
to
them.
you
just
told
us
that
they
are
bound
by
what
the
supreme
court
of
texas
said.
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean,
you
certainly
can't
mean
that
the
supreme
court
of
texas
said,
“gentlemen,
it's
up
to
you.
you
do
whatever
you
want.”
justice
potter
stewart
then
what
do
you
understand
that
they
are
required
to
do,
whether
you
order
the
supreme
court
of
texas?
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
confer
it
before
you
and
you
say,
the
petitioners
failed
to
show
discrimination
and
now
failed
to
show
discrimination
in
what?
we
don't
have
any
districting
now
before
us.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
what
did
you
mean
when
you
said
he's
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
your
points
insofar
as
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
goes
in
this
area
that
so
long
as
you
have
a
legislature,
apportioned
in
accord
with
the
rule
of
reynolds
against
sims,
then
is
the
constitutional
matter
that
legislature
can
be
entrusted.
that
legislature
responsive
as
it
is
to
the
people
proportionally
and
equally.
it
can
be
trusted
constitutionally
to
delegate
its
power
such
part
of
its
power
wherever
it
wants
to.
does
that
it
--
that
if
the
majority
of
the
people
in
texas
with
a
precisely
apportioned
legislature
in
accordance
of
reynolds
against
sims
want
to
give
to
each
of
these
254
counties
this
that
of
the
other
power,
they
can
constitutionally
do
so
and
they
can
constitutionally
take
it
away,
and
can
be
trusted
to
take
it
away
with
the
legislature
responsive
to
the
rule
reynolds
against
sims?
that's
suppose
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
there
a
constitutional
danger
there
so
long
as
you
have
a
constitutionally
apportioned
basic
statewide
legislature?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
talking
about
the
an
equal
(voice
overlap)
