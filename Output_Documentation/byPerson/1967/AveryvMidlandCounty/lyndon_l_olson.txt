mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
action
is
before
the
court
by
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
texas.
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
the
principle
of
one
man,
one
vote
as
established
in
reynolds
versus
sims
applies
to
the
governing
body
of
midland
county,
texas.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
function
of
the
county
government
in
texas
and
the
facts
in
this
case
suggest
that
the
question
be
answered
in
the
affirmative.
midland
county,
texas
is
located
in
west
central
texas.
it's
approximately
square
in
size,
contains
900
acres,
has
70,000
people
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
900
square
miles,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
900
square
miles.
and
it's
governed
by
a
governing
body
that's
established
by
article
v,
section
18
of
the
constitution
of
texas.
this
provision
of
the
constitution
provides
that
the
governing
body
shall
consist
of
a
county
commissioners
court
composed
of
a
county
judge
and
four
county
commissioners,
each
county
commissioner
to
be
elected
from
a
commissioners
precinct
and
to
be
elected
for
a
term
of
four
years.
the
county
commissioner's
precincts
are
boundaries
to
the
county
commissioners
precinct
or
established
by
the
commissioners
court.
the
original
county
commissioners
precincts
were
established
in
1885
and
in
the
late
1800s
and
the
early
1900s,
there
we're
two
or
three
minor
changes
made
and
no
further
changes
were
made
in
the
boundaries
of
the
county
commissioners
court
until
1963.
now
in
1952,
mr.
hank
avery,
the
petitioner
here
and
the
plaintiff
below,
appeared
before
the
county
commissioners
court
of
midland
county
and
pointed
out
to
the
court
at
this
time
the
disparity
of
population
between
the
commissioner's
precincts
and
the
county.
mr.
avery
pointed
out
that
commissioner's
precinct
won
of
which
he
was
a
resident,
contained
over
95%
of
the
population
of
midland
county
and
elected
only
one
member
to
the
commissioners
court.
that
commissioners
precincts
numbers
two,
three,
and
four,
contained
less
than
5%
of
the
population
of
the
county,
and
elected
three
members
of
the
commissioners
court.
and
therefore,
he
did
not
have
--
the
citizen
did
not
have
an
equal
voice
in
the
government,
governing
body
of
midland
county,
and
asked
that
county
be
redistributed
in
accordance
with
the
population.
his
request
was
denied.
in
1963,
mr.
avery
filed
a
lawsuit
in
midland
county,
texas
against
the
commissioners
court
to
require
the
entry
to
district
midland
county
in
accordance
with
substantial
numerical
quantity.
after
this
lawsuit
was
filed,
the
commissioners
court
held
what
they
designate
as
public
hearings
in
an
attempt
to
resolve
this
issue
and
mr.
avery
appeared
at
these
public
hearings
and
presented
a
plan
to
the
commissioners
court
whereby
the
county
could
be
divided
so
that
it
would
be
equal
in
population.
substantially
equal
insofar
as
miles
of
county
roads,
areas,
taxable
values,
and
so
forth.
the
proposition
of
mr.
avery
was
rejected.
the
commissioners
court
made
only
very
slight
changes
in
the
commissioners
precincts.
no
substantial
changes
in
an
area
or
in
population.
these
changes
were
made
in
august
1963
effective
january
1,
1964.
we
filed
an
amended
pleading
after
this
action
of
the
commissioners
court
and
the
case
was
tried
in
the
spring
of
1964.
now,
in
the
amended
pleading,
the
amended
pleading
showed
and
proof
substantiated
in
this
case
that
mr.
avery
was
a
resident
citizen
of
precinct
number
1
of
midland
county,
a
qualified
voter
and
taxpayer.
it
further
showed
that
the
county,
midland
county,
were
divided
into
four
commissioners
precincts
numbered
one,
two,
three,
and
four,
and
at
each
elected
one
member
to
the
commissioners
court.
the
pleadings
and
the
proof
further
showed
that
over
95%
of
the
population
of
midland
county
elected
one
member
of
the
commissioners
court.
and
that
precincts
number
two,
three,
and
four,
which
contained
less
than
5%
of
the
population
of
the
county,
elected
three
members
to
the
commissioners
court.
it
further
showed
that
county
judge
even
though
elected
by
the
citizens
throughout
the
county,
and
was
a
presiding
officer
voted
only
in
the
event
of
the
time.
the
pleadings
further
set
forth
that
this
constituted
invidious
discrimination
and
denied
to
the
petitioner
here
equal
protection
under
the
laws
as
guaranteed
to
him
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
united
states
constitution.
the
trial
court
in
midland
found
the
above
facts
to
be
true
and
further
found
that
the
county
knew
this,
the
county
governing
body
knew
these
facts
to
be
true
and
if
they
could
divide
midland
county
in
accordance
with
population
so
that
each
commissioners
precinct
would
have
substantially
the
same
number
of
people.
then
the
court
order
--
the
court
further
found
that
its
failure
to
do
so
constitute
invidious
discrimination,
and
ordered
the
county
commissioners
court
of
midland
county
to
redistrict
midland
county
in
the
commissioners
precincts,
so
that
each
commissioners
precinct
would
have
substantially
the
same
number
of
people.
after
this
order
was
entered
by
the
trial
court,
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
court
of
civil
--
by
the
respondents
here
in
the
appendix
below
to
the
court
of
civil
appeals
at
el
paso.
the
court
of
civil
appeals
at
el
paso
held
that
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
not
applicable
to
the
governing
body
of
midland
county
and
reversed
and
rendered
the
case.
we
filed
an
application
for
a
writ
of
error
to
the
supreme
court
of
texas
which
was
granted.
the
supreme
court
of
texas
reverse
the
court
of
civil
appeals
and
held
that
the
action
of
the
commissioners
court
of
midland
county
was
arbitrary
unreasonable
and
capricious.
it
further
held
--
it
further
reversed
the
trial
court
in
part
and
held
that
there
was
no
invidious
discrimination.
it
held
that
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
united
states
constitution
was
not
applicable
to
the
county
government
of
midland
county,
texas.
the
basis
for
this
apparently
was
there
was
a
variance
between
the
condition
of
the
people
that
live
in
rural
areas
and
urban
areas.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i've
probably
stated
that
loosely
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
--
an
effort
to
cover
background.
supreme
court
did
not
told
if
it
was
not
applicable
but
said
that
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
did
not
require
that
the
midland
county
be
divided
equally
insofar
population
is
concerned.
the
supreme
court
of
texas
further
held
that
this
court,
the
supreme
court,
did
not
have
authority
to
redistrict
midland
county
that
the
trial
court
did
not
have
authority
to
redistrict
midland
county
but
that
this
authority
was
vested
solely
in
the
commissioners
court
and
entered
an
order
directing
the
trial
court
to
enter
an
order
based
upon
this
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
texas.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
they
held,
your
honor,
specifically
in
regard
to
this
matter
of
population
that
we
disagree
with
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
and
its
requirement
that
midland
county
be
redistricted
in
the
commissioners
precinct
solely
upon
the
basis
of
population.
now,
they
held
in
that
case
that
the
supreme
court
of
texas
be
held
that
the
rural
residence
of
midland
county
texas
had
a
different
--
stood
in
a
different
place
in
the
county
government
than
the
urban
residence
of
midland
county
texas.
and
held
that
if
the
one
vote
--
one
man,
one
vote
principle
of
reynolds
versus
sims
were
--
was
applied
to
midland
county
texas,
the
voice
of
the
rural
area
would
be
lost.
and
therefore,
they
held
that
they
disagreed
with
the
trial
court
in
its
finding
that
the
one
man,
one
vote
principle
applies.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
well,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
do
not
agree
with
the
statement
of
the
supreme
court
of
texas
and
i'll
point
out
that
to
the
court
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
the
course
is
hard
to
define
what
constitute
legislative
functions
are
hard
for
me
to
define.
what
constitute
legislative
functions
and
what
constitutes
the
administrative
functions?
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
well,
i
think
that
this
court
when
it
looks
at
the
statutory
and
the
constitutional
duties
and
responsibilities,
they're
vested
in
the
commissioners
court
of
midland
county,
can
for
itself
make
this
decision
that
the
supreme
court
has
passed
overheard
me.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
we
do
have
home
rule
insofar
as
city
is
concerned
and
the
city
of
midland
is
the
home
rule
city.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
that
is
not
correct.
they
have
quite
a
lot
jurisdiction
over
there,
same
city
of
midland.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
one
being
they
have
--
they
establish
a
tax
rate
that
applies
to
all
of
the
taxable
values
of
property
both
inside
and
outside
the
city
of
midland.
they
specifically
have
authority
to
bill
a
numerous
public
buildings
inside
or
outside.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
they
do
not
--
under
the
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
the
constitution
provides
certain
rights
to
the
city
to
levy
an
ad
valorem
tax
and
also
to
county.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
the
county
levies
its
own
tax
and
the
city
levies
its
own
tax.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
that
money
is
used
with
the
operation
of
the
county
government
which
in
the
year
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
all
of
the
property
--
not
owned
by
the
city
itself
but
owned
by
all
the
residents
of
the
city
and
were
also
residents
of
midland
county
texas.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
the
county
fixes
the
rate
by
a
majority
of
vote
at
the
commissioners
court.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
the
rate
of
tax
is
fixed
by
the
governing
body
of
the
city
of
midland.
the
figure
that
this
is
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
of
the
county
of
midland.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
and
the
value
of
the
property
is
established
by
the
governing
body
of
midland
county
sitting
as
a
board
of
equalization.
and
all
property
is
to
be
tax
in
accordance
with
it
cash
market
value.
the
board
of
equalization
which
is
a
commissioners
court
can
establish
this
value
of
100%
of
actual
cash
market
value
at
20%
of
actual
cash
market
value
or
whatever
they
like.
and
this
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir,
fixing
the
value
of
the
property.
if
we
have
a
fix
property
that
has
a
cash
market
value
of
$10,000.
the
rate
to
be
applied
against
this
value
is
established
by
the
commissioners
court
sitting
as
the
board
of
equalization
established
by
the
commissioners
court.
then
they
convene
as
the
board
of
equalization
and
determine
what
value
shall
be
placed
on
the
tax
rules
whether
a
100%
of
value,
20%
of
value,
60%
of
value
or
what
percent
this
tax
rate
will
be
applied.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
and
personal
property.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
well,
the
maximum
rate
of
course
is
set
by
constitution.
i
believe
it's
$1.10
or
$1.25
by
the
constitution.
that's
a
maximum
rate
that
the
county
government
shall
set.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
to
operate
the
county
government.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
well,
the
maximum
is
fixed
by
the
state
constitution.
the
rate
is
fixed
by
the
governing
body
of
midland
county.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
the
constitution
says
that
it
shall
be
established
by
the
governing
body
of
the
county
but
that
it
shall
not
be
in
excess.
the
only
thing
the
constitution
does
is
set
the
top
tax
rate
that
a
county
can
charge.
in
midland
county,
in
--
during
the
trial
this
case,
they
we're
charging
it
$1.05
per
$100
valuation.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir,
the
rate
that
is
fixed
by
the
commissioners
court.
i
think
that
it
is
--
it
gets
into
the
realm
of
the
legislative-administrative
function.
my
opinion
is
the
establishment
of
the
tax
rate
which
is
a
very
important
function
that
affects
all
the
citizens
of
midland
county
and
the
establishment
of
tax
values
to
which
this
rate
is
applied
is
a
legislative
function.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
well,
the
tax
assessor
as
a
matter
of
administration
sets
a
value
and
then
all
of
these
values
once
a
year
come
before
the
county
commissioners
court
sitting
at
the
board
of
equalization.
and
if
they
think
these
values
are
too
low,
they
raise
them.
if
they
think
these
values
are
too
high,
they
lower
them.
that's
the
function
of
the
board
of
equalization
in
texas.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
in
my
opinion,
it
is
not.
i
think
one
of
the
most
important
legislative
functions
that
is
exercised
by
the
governing
body
of
midland
county,
texas
is
the
very
thing
is
before
this
court
today
and
the
courts
of
texas
has
construed
this
being
a
legislative
function,
and
that
is
establishing
a
precinct
boundaries
within
the
county.
they
also
established
the
constable
boundaries
within
the
county
and
also
established
the
precinct
boundaries
of
the
justices
of
peace
which
is
our
court
of
lowest
resort
in
texas.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
constable
is
a
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
--
a
constable
it's
a
--
a
police
officer
of
the
containing
serves,
processes,
and
has
general
police
function
such
as
the
sheriff's
own.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
they
have
a
sheriff.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
they're
elected
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
no.
the
sheriff
is
elected
by
all
of
the
citizens
of
midland
county.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
of
course
–-
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
voting
at
large.
of
course
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir,
it
does.
it
certainly
does,
yes.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
in
precinct,
yes.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
and
these
precinct
boundaries
are
the
number
of
constables
and
a
number
of
justices
of
peace
are
determined
by
the
county
commissioners
court.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no
sir.
well,
of
course,
there
could
be
because
all
of
the
precinct
lines
for
constable
justice
of
the
peace
and
for
the
commissioners
court
include
the
whole
of
the
county
without
regard
to
what
portion
of
it
is
an
incorporated
city,
town
or
village.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
well,
a
constable's
a
district
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
well,
yes,
sir.
they
serve
in
the
city
and
outside
of
the
city
so
far
as
serving
a
process
like
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
that
both
inside
and
outside
that
the
corporate
limits
of
the
city
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
and
the
sherif
and
the
texas
highway
patrol,
yes
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
both,
your
honor.
i
think
generally,
they're
referring
there
to
the
maintenance
and
repair
but
it
is
their
duty
and
responsibility
to
suggest
the
new
road
areas
and
to
maintain
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
and
the
statutes
in
texas
specifically
provide
that
they
can
build
these
roads
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
that's
what
i
was
basically
pointing
out.
the
statute
specifically
provides
that
the
commissioners
court
shall
have
authority
to
construct
bridges.
but
again
may
construct
for
roads
either
with
that
--
within
or
without
the
corporate
limits.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
sir?
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
they
do
not.
the
county
government
does
not
in
midland
county.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
from
taxes,
from
all
the
people
of
the
midland
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
levied
by
the
county
commissioners.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
levied
by
them
on
all
of
the
property
in
midland
county.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
it's
a
county
function.
now,
they
do
have
their
own
certain
roads
that
are
designated
state
roads.
the
state
of
texas
does
contribute
to
the
cost
of
construction
and
also
the
state
of
texas
has
a
foreign
market
--
what
we
call
a
foreign
market
road
program,
where
they
on
a
certain
designated
foreign
market
roads
or
they
call
it
ranch
to
market
roads
in
midland
areas.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
the
state
will
pay
a
portion
or
all
the
cost
of
construction
and
the
responsibility
of
the
county
is
to
furnish
the
right
of
way.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
or
of
course,
they
have
authority
to
vote
and
issue
bonds,
to
be
paid
for
by
taxes,
levied
against
all
the
citizens
of
midland
county
to
pay
for
the
construction
and
maintenance
of
these
roads.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
this
whole
discretion.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
and
of
course,
for
the
record
in
this
case
reflects
that
there
was
a
great
disparity
between
the
percentage
of
value
that
was
applied
to
city
property
and
rural
property.
but
that
is
a
matter
to
be
determined
by
the
county
governing
body.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
there
is
at
the
present
time
a
county
free
library
located
in
midland.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
there
is
--
they
have
the
authority
to
create
nor
not
to
create
and
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
but
there
is
no
one
in
midland
county
but
the
commissioners
court
if
they
so
desire
could
create
a
county
hospital
they
pay
the
taxes.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
we
have
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
there's
two
independent
school
districts
in
midland
county.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
sir?
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
they
have
--
they
have
the
authority,
the
board
of
commissioners
court
of
midland
county
have
the
authority
to
establish
a
sewer
system
and
have
the
authority
to
establish
a
garbage
collection
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
well,
--
yes,
they
would
have
that
authority.
they
do
not
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
well,
there
is
the
overlapping
of
jurisdiction
in
a
number
of
areas
between
the
city
government
and
the
county
government
there
in
texas.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
these
--
by
statutes
specifically,
the
county
has
authority
to
create
a
park
and
recreation
area,
anywhere
within
the
county
of
midland.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
they
do
not.
of
course,
numerous
counties
in
texas
do
have
but
midland
does
not.
now,
the
city
of
midland
does
but
midland
county
had
not
designated
any
park
or
recreation
area.
of
course,
the
area
there
is
a
reservoir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
they
operate
out
of
the
county
court
house
which
is
located
in
the
city
of
midland.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
the
courthouse
is
the
county
office
building
and
in
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
sir?
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
they
have
a
sheriff
and
constables.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
the
sheriff
operates
out
of
the
courthouse
and
the
constables
operate
out
of
the
various
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
there's
no
overlapping
of
jurisdiction
between
the
various
law
enforcement
officers.of
course
as
a
practical
manner,
large
portion
of
the
sheriff's
responsibilities
are
serving
papers
along
with
the
constable.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
they
can
each
establish
their
own
library.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
and
the
county
commissioners
court
are
the
governing
body
of
midland
county
has
the
authority
to
levy
taxes
against
all
of
the
citizens
of
midland
county
to
establish
its
land
there
and
of
course
the
city
of
midland
would
have
authority
to
levy
taxes
against
the
citizens
of
the
city
of
midland.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
it's
the
same
property.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
about
what
sir?
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
we
have
a
liquor
license
not
by
the
drink
but
to
go
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
well,
of
course
the
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
texas
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes.
that's
--
yes,
sir.
texas
has
local
options.
that
was
--
there's
one
--
see
this
--
this
is
an
interesting
area,
mr.
justice
white.
they
have
--
there's
one
--
these
commissioners
precincts
or
the
areas
that
determine
the
wet-dry
issue
and
there
is
one,
i
think
it's
commissioners
precinct
number
4
in
midland
county
that's
dry
and
the
other
three
are
wet
for
the
sale
of
liquor.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
the
county
has
authority
under
the
statute
to
operate
a
welfare
program.
they
have
authority
to
provide
medical
care
for
the
indigent
which
they
are
providing
at
the
present
time.
midland
county
is
providing
a
medical
care
for
the
indigent.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
all
over
the
county
including
the
city
of
midland.
now,
they
can
establish
a
cooperative
program
and
the
city
county
help
unit
which
they
have
numerous
areas
and
have
in
midland
county.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
a
city
--
they
cooperate
together
on
this
--
on
matters
such
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
on
a
library
that
you
could
have
a
library
on
the
west
side
and
the
east
side
or
the
city
can
cooperate
with
the
county
and
establish
one
library
which
they've
done
in
numerous
counties.
a
part
can
establish
one
health
unit
to
provide
the
care
for
the
indigent
and
have
a
city
county
help
officer
as
paid
partly
by
the
county
and
partly
by
the
city
and
provide
services
to
all
of
the
citizens
in
midland
county
regardless
of
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
it
is
but
city
also
is
a
taxing
authority,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
they
do
not.
none
of
them
go
to
the
state
capital
where
the
exception
of
the
recently
established
city
sales
tax
was
authorized
in
texas.
its
required
only
to
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
--
but
that's
not
in
this
case.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
but
none
of
it
goes
to
the
state
in
its
return.
it's
all
--
there
is
a
county,
tax
assessor,
and
collector.
there
is
a
city
county
tax
--
city
tax
assessor
and
collector.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
now,
it
is
the
position
of
the
petitioner
herein
that
the
one
man,
one
vote
principle
as
set
forth
in
reynolds
versus
sims
applies
to
the
governing
body
of
midland
county,
texas.
the
members
of
its
governing
body
are
elected
and
perform
both
legislative
and
administrative
functions.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
i
would,
your
honor.
my
opinion
is
that
this
matter
was
pretty
well
decided
--
what
were
decided
by
this
court
in
gray
versus
sanders,
and
i
feel
that
a
person
is
not
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
well,
my
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
--
recollection
was
it
involves
some
high
state
officials
other
than
just
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
that
was
my
understanding
of
it
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
it
certainly
is.
i
think
under
the
two
issues
decided
by
this
court
at
the
last
term,
the
sailors
case
and
the
dusch
case
that
it's
a
very
significant.
i
think
under
those
cases
is
that
they
were
not
elected.
that
this
doctrine
would
not
apply.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
they
could
by
constitutional
amendment
but
it
would
take
the
constitutional
amendment
and
of
course
--
well
we
never
have
constitutional
amendment
in
texas
is
by
two-thirds
vote
of
both
houses
submitted
the
vote
of
people
but
i
think
that
they
could,
yes,
sir.
i
don't
want
to
be
repetitious
on
this
pointed
out
some
of
the
duties
and
responsibilities
of
the
commissioners
court
but
i
think
for
the
continuity
of
this,
i'd
like
to
go
hardly
over
this.
article
v,
section
18
of
the
constitution
provides
that
the
commissioners
court
shall
have
such
powers
and
duties
overall
county
business
as
it's
established
by
the
constitution
in
the
states.
now,
i
would
point
out
that
this
time,
mr.
justice
stewart
made
a
mention
about
the
designation
of
this
body
as
a
court,
this
is
a
misnomer
and
the
supreme
court
of
texas
so
held
in
its
opinion
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
not
on
your
part,
your
honor.
on
the
part
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
it's
what's
called
but
it's
a
misnomer
according
to
the
supreme
court
of
texas
and
that
it
provides
no
judicial
functions
as
such.
it's
a
misnomer
that
was
placed
by
the
texas
constitution.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
your
honor.
and
of
course,
the
county
judge
does
perform
some
judicial
functions.
we
have
a
jurisdiction
governed
by
the
county
judge,
probate
manners,
and
then
within
$200
to
$500.
and
$500
and
$1000
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
that.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
not
in
texas.
the
county
judge
does
not
have
to
be
a
lawyer.
now,
the
county
commissioners
court
is
a
sole
governing
body
in
midland
county.
there
is
no
other
governing
body
of
midland
county.
now,
the
authority
of
the
setup
in
this
board
is
both
setup
by
the
constitution
and
setup
by
the
statute
but
the
constitution
says
it
--
it
says
it
shall
have
control
of
all
of
the
county
government.
as
i
pointed
out,
it
has
the
authority
of
taxation
to
set
tax
rates
set
as
a
board
of
equalization
to
adjust
the
ad
valorem
values
offered
then.
it
has
the
authority
to
establish
a
budget
which
in
the
trial
of
this
case
in
1963
was
something
under
$2
million.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
it
does
not.
we
have
two
independent
school
districts
in
midland
county,
midland
independent
and
great
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
that's
correct.
yes.
now,
in
regards
to
this
budget,
there's
some
very
significant
factors.
the
supreme
court
of
texas
in
its
opinion
said
that
there
were
some
case
countywide
of
officers
that
were
elected
by
all
of
the
people.
that's
true
in
the
county
there
--
that
perform
ministerial
functions
such
as
the
sheriff.
the
county
tax
assessor
and
collector,
the
district
clerk
in
the
county
survey.
but
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
sir?
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
in
a
probate
judge.
i
think
it's
very
significant
in
this
regard
that
the
salaries
of
these
officials
are
set
by
the
commissioners
court,
the
governing
body
of
midland
county,
and
the
salary
of
all
of
their
employees,
if
any,
set
by
the
commissioners
court.
so
if
the
commissioners
court
doesn't
feel
like
that
they
want
anything
other
than
a
sheriff
in
the
county,
they
can
just
not
approve
a
budget
for
any
deputies.
and
of
course,
the
same
thing
can
apply
to
tax
assessor
and
collector's
office,
and
so
forth
so
on.
in
fact,
they
established
a
budget
that
runs
all
of
the
government.
they
even
insofar
as
these
elected
officials
who
perform
ministerial
duties.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
they
have
the
same
authority
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
on
occasion
they
do,
yes
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes
sir,
they
perform
most
of
the
duties
outside
the
city.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
and
highway
patrol.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
well,
except
for
the
constable,
and
of
course,
they
do
have
the
designated
function
of
serving
all
judicial
papers.
the
city
police
force
has
no
authority
to
serve
any
judicial
papers
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes.
it
serves
the
police
--
the
municipal
corporation
court
in
midland
has
--
of
course,
the
police
officers
have
authority
to
serve
the
various
writs
in
connection
with
that
court.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
which
incidentally
has
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
the
justice
court,
the
precincts
of
which
are
established
by
the
county
commissioners
court.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
inside
or
outside,
200
--
misdemeanor
fine
is
$200
or
less
and
no
jail
sentence.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
i
would
say
it
would
be
about
the
same.
there
may
be
some
portion
of
that
that
was
received
from
the
state
of
texas
for
highway
or
road
construction
but
most
of
it
comes
from
taxes.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
the
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
the
testimony
in
this
case
show
that
approximately
65%
was
received
from
what
do
we
have
in
precinct
number
1,
which
is
the
city
of
midland.
and
the
remainder
came
from
precincts
number
2,
3,
and
4,
which
is
outside
the
city,
i
mean
65%.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
well,
it
would
be
hard
to
do,
your
honor.
however,
there
is
a
connected
with
this
record,
the
budget
of
the
city
of
midland
county
for
the
years
up
to
1964
which
would
show
that
where
the
expenditures
were
made,
now
of
course,
the
budget
would
not
disclose
what
portion
of
it
was
used
within
the
corporate
limits
of
the
city
of
midland.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
your
honor.
in
addition
to
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
there
is
a
substantial
suburban
area
outside
the
incorporated
limits
of
the
city
of
midland
which
is
in
commissioners
precinct
number
1.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
it's
pretty
well-established
by
the
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
i
don't
have
those
exact
figures
but
the
--
a
substantial
portion
of
it
or
the
large
portion
of
it
was
within
the
corporate
limits
of
the
city
of
midland
in
commissioner
precinct
number
1.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
it's
all
--
it's
also
in
commissioners
precinct
number
1.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
95%
of
the
population
–-
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
--
of
midland
county
is
in
commissioners
precinct
number
1.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
it's
not
exactly
right,
your
honor.
there
is
a
small
portion,
i
think,
they
have
this
in
this
case
show
about
400
people
live
inside
the
corporate
limits
of
the
city
of
midland
and
are
located
in
commissioners
precinct
number
4,
i
believe
it
is.
this
is
the
airport
when
the
city
of
midland
took
in
its
airport
it
run
a
land,
it
took
in
the
airport
and
it's
out
from
town.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
sir?
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
we
do
not
have
a
township,
this
is
an
incorporated
city
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
this
is
the
only
one.
the
city
of
midland
is
the
only
incorporated
city,
town
and
village
in
midland
county.
now,
in
addition
to
these
authorities
of
taxation
and
physical
--
fiscal
matters,
now
the
county
has
authority
to
create
a
hospital,
medical
care
for
the
indigent,
garbage
collection,
bearing
it
offers
these
various
similar
functions.
they
have
numerous
safety
functions
such
as
we
pointed
out
the
deputy
sheriff,
constables,
fire
protection.
they
have
the
authority
to
create
a
public
facility
such
as
public
libraries,
which
they
have
in
midland.
they
have
the
authority
to
create
airports,
public
housing,
waterworks,
park,
and
recreation
areas,
auditoriums,
coliseums,
and
the
sole
authority
to
either
create
these
or
not
to
create
these
in
the
governing
body
of
midland
county
texas.
they
have
the
authority
to
construct
bridges
and
roads
either
within
or
without
the
corporate
limits
of
the
city
of
midland
and
they
have
the
general
authority
of
eminent
domain.
they
have
authority
to
issue
in
both
--
to
issue
and
sell
bonds,
and
to
control
the
subdivision
of
land
throughout
the
county.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
that's
a
--
it
may
be
construed
as
zoning
in
the
sense,
your
honor.
the
statute
provides
that
before
land
can
be
sold
according
now
as
lot
and
block
rather
than
the
general
type
field
note
descriptions,
the
plan
must
be
filed
of
record
with
the
county
clerk.
now,
the
plan
cannot
be
file
a
record
with
the
county
clerk
if
it's
located
outside
in
the
incorporated
city
town
or
village
or
within
five
miles
unless
it's
approved
by
the
county
commissioners
court.
they,
in
this,
can
require
such
thing
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
out
--
if
it's
located
inside
the
city,
it
does
not
have
to
be
approved
by
the
county
commissioners
court.
but
it's
located
outside
the
city
and
not
within
five
miles
to
the
city,
it
must
be
approved
by
the
county
commissioners
court
and
they
can
require
a
certain
portion
of
this
area
to
be
set
aside
for
park
and
recreation
purposes,
a
certain
portion
to
be
set
aside
for
roads,
and
that
sort
of
thing
before
they
would
approve
the
plan.
now,
there
are
several
significant
facts
that
are
firmly
established
in
this
case.
one
is
that
the
governing
body
of
midland
county
is
important
in
the
lives
of
all
of
the
citizens
of
the
county.
the
governing
body
of
midland
county
performs
legislative
and
administrative
functions
that
daily
affect
the
lives
and
welfare
of
all
the
citizens.
the
governing
body
of
midland
county
is
controlled
by
less
than
5%
of
the
people
who
elect
three
members
to
the
governing
body.
there
is
no
effective
way
for
the
voice
of
over
95%
of
the
citizens
of
midland
county
to
be
heard
insofar
as
our
county
governing
body
is
concerned
since
they
can
elect
only
one
member
to
the
commissioners
court.
and
we
feel
that
this
condition
will
remain
unless
it's
changed
by
this
court.
now,
it's
the
position
of
the
petitioner
here
that
each
citizen
of
midland
county
is
entitled
to
an
equal
vote
in
the
election
of
the
county
governing
body.
how
else
can
we
have
representative
government?
we
earnestly
submit
that
each
man
regardless
of
the
color
of
his
skin
or
the
cut
of
his
coat
or
the
place
of
his
residence
is
entitled
to
an
equal
vote.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
actually
97%
of
the
qualified
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
fortas
prior
to
the
luncheon
recess
have
asked
me
a
question
in
regard
to
the
--
whether
or
not
there
were
some
rationale
for
providing
the
governing
body
for
midland
county
in
regard
insofar
as
the
rural
population
is
concerned.
in
answer
sir
to
that
question,
my
statement
would
be
that
article
v,
section
18
the
texas
constitution
provides
that
the
commissioners
precinct
line
shall
be
changed
from
time
to
time
for
the
convenience
of
the
people.
it
doesn't
say
rural
people
and
it
doesn't
say
urban
people.
i
feel
that
the
governing
body
of
midland
county
affects
all
of
the
people
of
county
and
it
should
be
divided
accordingly.
i
would
point
out
that
apparently
this
same
question
was
raised
before
the
court
in
reynolds
versus
sims
that
if
the
“one
man,
one
vote”
principle
were
applied
and
the
voice
of
the
rural
area
would
be
heard.
the
court
in
that
case
provided
that
we
are
advised
that
states
can
rationally
considers
the
facts
other
than
population
in
apportioning
legislation
representation.
our
answer
is
this,
a
denial
of
the
constitutionally
protected
rights
demand
judicial
protection.
our
oath
in
our
office
require
no
less
to
the
extent
that
the
citizen's
right
to
vote
is
the
base,
he
is
that
much
less
a
citizen.
the
fact
that
a
citizen
lives
here
or
there
is
not
a
legitimate
reason
for
overweighting
or
deluding
his
vote.
a
citizen,
a
qualified
voter
is
no
more
or
no
less
so
because
he
lives
in
the
city
or
on
a
farm.
this
is
a
clear
and
strong
command
of
our
constitution
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
if
it
please
the
court,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
logic
as
so
clearly
set
forth
in
reynolds
versus
sims
is
applicable
to
the
county
government
of
midland
county
texas.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
we
have
nothing
further,
your
honor.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
action
is
before
the
court
by
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
texas.
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
the
principle
of
one
man,
one
vote
as
established
in
reynolds
versus
sims
applies
to
the
governing
body
of
midland
county,
texas.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
function
of
the
county
government
in
texas
and
the
facts
in
this
case
suggest
that
the
question
be
answered
in
the
affirmative.
midland
county,
texas
is
located
in
west
central
texas.
it's
approximately
square
in
size,
contains
900
acres,
has
70,000
people
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
900
square
miles,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
900
square
miles.
and
it's
governed
by
a
governing
body
that's
established
by
article
v,
section
18
of
the
constitution
of
texas.
this
provision
of
the
constitution
provides
that
the
governing
body
shall
consist
of
a
county
commissioners
court
composed
of
a
county
judge
and
four
county
commissioners,
each
county
commissioner
to
be
elected
from
a
commissioners
precinct
and
to
be
elected
for
a
term
of
four
years.
the
county
commissioner's
precincts
are
boundaries
to
the
county
commissioners
precinct
or
established
by
the
commissioners
court.
the
original
county
commissioners
precincts
were
established
in
1885
and
in
the
late
1800s
and
the
early
1900s,
there
we're
two
or
three
minor
changes
made
and
no
further
changes
were
made
in
the
boundaries
of
the
county
commissioners
court
until
1963.
now
in
1952,
mr.
hank
avery,
the
petitioner
here
and
the
plaintiff
below,
appeared
before
the
county
commissioners
court
of
midland
county
and
pointed
out
to
the
court
at
this
time
the
disparity
of
population
between
the
commissioner's
precincts
and
the
county.
mr.
avery
pointed
out
that
commissioner's
precinct
won
of
which
he
was
a
resident,
contained
over
95%
of
the
population
of
midland
county
and
elected
only
one
member
to
the
commissioners
court.
that
commissioners
precincts
numbers
two,
three,
and
four,
contained
less
than
5%
of
the
population
of
the
county,
and
elected
three
members
of
the
commissioners
court.
and
therefore,
he
did
not
have
--
the
citizen
did
not
have
an
equal
voice
in
the
government,
governing
body
of
midland
county,
and
asked
that
county
be
redistributed
in
accordance
with
the
population.
his
request
was
denied.
in
1963,
mr.
avery
filed
a
lawsuit
in
midland
county,
texas
against
the
commissioners
court
to
require
the
entry
to
district
midland
county
in
accordance
with
substantial
numerical
quantity.
after
this
lawsuit
was
filed,
the
commissioners
court
held
what
they
designate
as
public
hearings
in
an
attempt
to
resolve
this
issue
and
mr.
avery
appeared
at
these
public
hearings
and
presented
a
plan
to
the
commissioners
court
whereby
the
county
could
be
divided
so
that
it
would
be
equal
in
population.
substantially
equal
insofar
as
miles
of
county
roads,
areas,
taxable
values,
and
so
forth.
the
proposition
of
mr.
avery
was
rejected.
the
commissioners
court
made
only
very
slight
changes
in
the
commissioners
precincts.
no
substantial
changes
in
an
area
or
in
population.
these
changes
were
made
in
august
1963
effective
january
1,
1964.
we
filed
an
amended
pleading
after
this
action
of
the
commissioners
court
and
the
case
was
tried
in
the
spring
of
1964.
now,
in
the
amended
pleading,
the
amended
pleading
showed
and
proof
substantiated
in
this
case
that
mr.
avery
was
a
resident
citizen
of
precinct
number
1
of
midland
county,
a
qualified
voter
and
taxpayer.
it
further
showed
that
the
county,
midland
county,
were
divided
into
four
commissioners
precincts
numbered
one,
two,
three,
and
four,
and
at
each
elected
one
member
to
the
commissioners
court.
the
pleadings
and
the
proof
further
showed
that
over
95%
of
the
population
of
midland
county
elected
one
member
of
the
commissioners
court.
and
that
precincts
number
two,
three,
and
four,
which
contained
less
than
5%
of
the
population
of
the
county,
elected
three
members
to
the
commissioners
court.
it
further
showed
that
county
judge
even
though
elected
by
the
citizens
throughout
the
county,
and
was
a
presiding
officer
voted
only
in
the
event
of
the
time.
the
pleadings
further
set
forth
that
this
constituted
invidious
discrimination
and
denied
to
the
petitioner
here
equal
protection
under
the
laws
as
guaranteed
to
him
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
united
states
constitution.
the
trial
court
in
midland
found
the
above
facts
to
be
true
and
further
found
that
the
county
knew
this,
the
county
governing
body
knew
these
facts
to
be
true
and
if
they
could
divide
midland
county
in
accordance
with
population
so
that
each
commissioners
precinct
would
have
substantially
the
same
number
of
people.
then
the
court
order
--
the
court
further
found
that
its
failure
to
do
so
constitute
invidious
discrimination,
and
ordered
the
county
commissioners
court
of
midland
county
to
redistrict
midland
county
in
the
commissioners
precincts,
so
that
each
commissioners
precinct
would
have
substantially
the
same
number
of
people.
after
this
order
was
entered
by
the
trial
court,
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
court
of
civil
--
by
the
respondents
here
in
the
appendix
below
to
the
court
of
civil
appeals
at
el
paso.
the
court
of
civil
appeals
at
el
paso
held
that
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
not
applicable
to
the
governing
body
of
midland
county
and
reversed
and
rendered
the
case.
we
filed
an
application
for
a
writ
of
error
to
the
supreme
court
of
texas
which
was
granted.
the
supreme
court
of
texas
reverse
the
court
of
civil
appeals
and
held
that
the
action
of
the
commissioners
court
of
midland
county
was
arbitrary
unreasonable
and
capricious.
it
further
held
--
it
further
reversed
the
trial
court
in
part
and
held
that
there
was
no
invidious
discrimination.
it
held
that
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
united
states
constitution
was
not
applicable
to
the
county
government
of
midland
county,
texas.
the
basis
for
this
apparently
was
there
was
a
variance
between
the
condition
of
the
people
that
live
in
rural
areas
and
urban
areas.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i've
probably
stated
that
loosely
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
--
an
effort
to
cover
background.
supreme
court
did
not
told
if
it
was
not
applicable
but
said
that
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
did
not
require
that
the
midland
county
be
divided
equally
insofar
population
is
concerned.
the
supreme
court
of
texas
further
held
that
this
court,
the
supreme
court,
did
not
have
authority
to
redistrict
midland
county
that
the
trial
court
did
not
have
authority
to
redistrict
midland
county
but
that
this
authority
was
vested
solely
in
the
commissioners
court
and
entered
an
order
directing
the
trial
court
to
enter
an
order
based
upon
this
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
texas.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
they
held,
your
honor,
specifically
in
regard
to
this
matter
of
population
that
we
disagree
with
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
and
its
requirement
that
midland
county
be
redistricted
in
the
commissioners
precinct
solely
upon
the
basis
of
population.
now,
they
held
in
that
case
that
the
supreme
court
of
texas
be
held
that
the
rural
residence
of
midland
county
texas
had
a
different
--
stood
in
a
different
place
in
the
county
government
than
the
urban
residence
of
midland
county
texas.
and
held
that
if
the
one
vote
--
one
man,
one
vote
principle
of
reynolds
versus
sims
were
--
was
applied
to
midland
county
texas,
the
voice
of
the
rural
area
would
be
lost.
and
therefore,
they
held
that
they
disagreed
with
the
trial
court
in
its
finding
that
the
one
man,
one
vote
principle
applies.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
well,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
do
not
agree
with
the
statement
of
the
supreme
court
of
texas
and
i'll
point
out
that
to
the
court
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
the
course
is
hard
to
define
what
constitute
legislative
functions
are
hard
for
me
to
define.
what
constitute
legislative
functions
and
what
constitutes
the
administrative
functions?
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
well,
i
think
that
this
court
when
it
looks
at
the
statutory
and
the
constitutional
duties
and
responsibilities,
they're
vested
in
the
commissioners
court
of
midland
county,
can
for
itself
make
this
decision
that
the
supreme
court
has
passed
overheard
me.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
we
do
have
home
rule
insofar
as
city
is
concerned
and
the
city
of
midland
is
the
home
rule
city.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
that
is
not
correct.
they
have
quite
a
lot
jurisdiction
over
there,
same
city
of
midland.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
one
being
they
have
--
they
establish
a
tax
rate
that
applies
to
all
of
the
taxable
values
of
property
both
inside
and
outside
the
city
of
midland.
they
specifically
have
authority
to
bill
a
numerous
public
buildings
inside
or
outside.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
they
do
not
--
under
the
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
the
constitution
provides
certain
rights
to
the
city
to
levy
an
ad
valorem
tax
and
also
to
county.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
the
county
levies
its
own
tax
and
the
city
levies
its
own
tax.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
that
money
is
used
with
the
operation
of
the
county
government
which
in
the
year
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
all
of
the
property
--
not
owned
by
the
city
itself
but
owned
by
all
the
residents
of
the
city
and
were
also
residents
of
midland
county
texas.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
the
county
fixes
the
rate
by
a
majority
of
vote
at
the
commissioners
court.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
the
rate
of
tax
is
fixed
by
the
governing
body
of
the
city
of
midland.
the
figure
that
this
is
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
of
the
county
of
midland.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
and
the
value
of
the
property
is
established
by
the
governing
body
of
midland
county
sitting
as
a
board
of
equalization.
and
all
property
is
to
be
tax
in
accordance
with
it
cash
market
value.
the
board
of
equalization
which
is
a
commissioners
court
can
establish
this
value
of
100%
of
actual
cash
market
value
at
20%
of
actual
cash
market
value
or
whatever
they
like.
and
this
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir,
fixing
the
value
of
the
property.
if
we
have
a
fix
property
that
has
a
cash
market
value
of
$10,000.
the
rate
to
be
applied
against
this
value
is
established
by
the
commissioners
court
sitting
as
the
board
of
equalization
established
by
the
commissioners
court.
then
they
convene
as
the
board
of
equalization
and
determine
what
value
shall
be
placed
on
the
tax
rules
whether
a
100%
of
value,
20%
of
value,
60%
of
value
or
what
percent
this
tax
rate
will
be
applied.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
and
personal
property.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
well,
the
maximum
rate
of
course
is
set
by
constitution.
i
believe
it's
$1.10
or
$1.25
by
the
constitution.
that's
a
maximum
rate
that
the
county
government
shall
set.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
to
operate
the
county
government.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
well,
the
maximum
is
fixed
by
the
state
constitution.
the
rate
is
fixed
by
the
governing
body
of
midland
county.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
the
constitution
says
that
it
shall
be
established
by
the
governing
body
of
the
county
but
that
it
shall
not
be
in
excess.
the
only
thing
the
constitution
does
is
set
the
top
tax
rate
that
a
county
can
charge.
in
midland
county,
in
--
during
the
trial
this
case,
they
we're
charging
it
$1.05
per
$100
valuation.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir,
the
rate
that
is
fixed
by
the
commissioners
court.
i
think
that
it
is
--
it
gets
into
the
realm
of
the
legislative-administrative
function.
my
opinion
is
the
establishment
of
the
tax
rate
which
is
a
very
important
function
that
affects
all
the
citizens
of
midland
county
and
the
establishment
of
tax
values
to
which
this
rate
is
applied
is
a
legislative
function.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
well,
the
tax
assessor
as
a
matter
of
administration
sets
a
value
and
then
all
of
these
values
once
a
year
come
before
the
county
commissioners
court
sitting
at
the
board
of
equalization.
and
if
they
think
these
values
are
too
low,
they
raise
them.
if
they
think
these
values
are
too
high,
they
lower
them.
that's
the
function
of
the
board
of
equalization
in
texas.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
in
my
opinion,
it
is
not.
i
think
one
of
the
most
important
legislative
functions
that
is
exercised
by
the
governing
body
of
midland
county,
texas
is
the
very
thing
is
before
this
court
today
and
the
courts
of
texas
has
construed
this
being
a
legislative
function,
and
that
is
establishing
a
precinct
boundaries
within
the
county.
they
also
established
the
constable
boundaries
within
the
county
and
also
established
the
precinct
boundaries
of
the
justices
of
peace
which
is
our
court
of
lowest
resort
in
texas.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
constable
is
a
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
--
a
constable
it's
a
--
a
police
officer
of
the
containing
serves,
processes,
and
has
general
police
function
such
as
the
sheriff's
own.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
they
have
a
sheriff.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
they're
elected
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
no.
the
sheriff
is
elected
by
all
of
the
citizens
of
midland
county.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
of
course
–-
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
voting
at
large.
of
course
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir,
it
does.
it
certainly
does,
yes.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
in
precinct,
yes.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
and
these
precinct
boundaries
are
the
number
of
constables
and
a
number
of
justices
of
peace
are
determined
by
the
county
commissioners
court.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no
sir.
well,
of
course,
there
could
be
because
all
of
the
precinct
lines
for
constable
justice
of
the
peace
and
for
the
commissioners
court
include
the
whole
of
the
county
without
regard
to
what
portion
of
it
is
an
incorporated
city,
town
or
village.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
well,
a
constable's
a
district
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
well,
yes,
sir.
they
serve
in
the
city
and
outside
of
the
city
so
far
as
serving
a
process
like
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
that
both
inside
and
outside
that
the
corporate
limits
of
the
city
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
and
the
sherif
and
the
texas
highway
patrol,
yes
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
both,
your
honor.
i
think
generally,
they're
referring
there
to
the
maintenance
and
repair
but
it
is
their
duty
and
responsibility
to
suggest
the
new
road
areas
and
to
maintain
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
and
the
statutes
in
texas
specifically
provide
that
they
can
build
these
roads
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
that's
what
i
was
basically
pointing
out.
the
statute
specifically
provides
that
the
commissioners
court
shall
have
authority
to
construct
bridges.
but
again
may
construct
for
roads
either
with
that
--
within
or
without
the
corporate
limits.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
sir?
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
they
do
not.
the
county
government
does
not
in
midland
county.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
from
taxes,
from
all
the
people
of
the
midland
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
levied
by
the
county
commissioners.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
levied
by
them
on
all
of
the
property
in
midland
county.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
it's
a
county
function.
now,
they
do
have
their
own
certain
roads
that
are
designated
state
roads.
the
state
of
texas
does
contribute
to
the
cost
of
construction
and
also
the
state
of
texas
has
a
foreign
market
--
what
we
call
a
foreign
market
road
program,
where
they
on
a
certain
designated
foreign
market
roads
or
they
call
it
ranch
to
market
roads
in
midland
areas.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
the
state
will
pay
a
portion
or
all
the
cost
of
construction
and
the
responsibility
of
the
county
is
to
furnish
the
right
of
way.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
or
of
course,
they
have
authority
to
vote
and
issue
bonds,
to
be
paid
for
by
taxes,
levied
against
all
the
citizens
of
midland
county
to
pay
for
the
construction
and
maintenance
of
these
roads.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
this
whole
discretion.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
and
of
course,
for
the
record
in
this
case
reflects
that
there
was
a
great
disparity
between
the
percentage
of
value
that
was
applied
to
city
property
and
rural
property.
but
that
is
a
matter
to
be
determined
by
the
county
governing
body.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
there
is
at
the
present
time
a
county
free
library
located
in
midland.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
there
is
--
they
have
the
authority
to
create
nor
not
to
create
and
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
but
there
is
no
one
in
midland
county
but
the
commissioners
court
if
they
so
desire
could
create
a
county
hospital
they
pay
the
taxes.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
we
have
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
there's
two
independent
school
districts
in
midland
county.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
sir?
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
they
have
--
they
have
the
authority,
the
board
of
commissioners
court
of
midland
county
have
the
authority
to
establish
a
sewer
system
and
have
the
authority
to
establish
a
garbage
collection
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
well,
--
yes,
they
would
have
that
authority.
they
do
not
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
well,
there
is
the
overlapping
of
jurisdiction
in
a
number
of
areas
between
the
city
government
and
the
county
government
there
in
texas.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
these
--
by
statutes
specifically,
the
county
has
authority
to
create
a
park
and
recreation
area,
anywhere
within
the
county
of
midland.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
they
do
not.
of
course,
numerous
counties
in
texas
do
have
but
midland
does
not.
now,
the
city
of
midland
does
but
midland
county
had
not
designated
any
park
or
recreation
area.
of
course,
the
area
there
is
a
reservoir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
they
operate
out
of
the
county
court
house
which
is
located
in
the
city
of
midland.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
the
courthouse
is
the
county
office
building
and
in
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
sir?
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
they
have
a
sheriff
and
constables.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
the
sheriff
operates
out
of
the
courthouse
and
the
constables
operate
out
of
the
various
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
there's
no
overlapping
of
jurisdiction
between
the
various
law
enforcement
officers.of
course
as
a
practical
manner,
large
portion
of
the
sheriff's
responsibilities
are
serving
papers
along
with
the
constable.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
they
can
each
establish
their
own
library.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
and
the
county
commissioners
court
are
the
governing
body
of
midland
county
has
the
authority
to
levy
taxes
against
all
of
the
citizens
of
midland
county
to
establish
its
land
there
and
of
course
the
city
of
midland
would
have
authority
to
levy
taxes
against
the
citizens
of
the
city
of
midland.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
it's
the
same
property.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
about
what
sir?
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
we
have
a
liquor
license
not
by
the
drink
but
to
go
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
well,
of
course
the
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
texas
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes.
that's
--
yes,
sir.
texas
has
local
options.
that
was
--
there's
one
--
see
this
--
this
is
an
interesting
area,
mr.
justice
white.
they
have
--
there's
one
--
these
commissioners
precincts
or
the
areas
that
determine
the
wet-dry
issue
and
there
is
one,
i
think
it's
commissioners
precinct
number
4
in
midland
county
that's
dry
and
the
other
three
are
wet
for
the
sale
of
liquor.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
the
county
has
authority
under
the
statute
to
operate
a
welfare
program.
they
have
authority
to
provide
medical
care
for
the
indigent
which
they
are
providing
at
the
present
time.
midland
county
is
providing
a
medical
care
for
the
indigent.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
all
over
the
county
including
the
city
of
midland.
now,
they
can
establish
a
cooperative
program
and
the
city
county
help
unit
which
they
have
numerous
areas
and
have
in
midland
county.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
a
city
--
they
cooperate
together
on
this
--
on
matters
such
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
on
a
library
that
you
could
have
a
library
on
the
west
side
and
the
east
side
or
the
city
can
cooperate
with
the
county
and
establish
one
library
which
they've
done
in
numerous
counties.
a
part
can
establish
one
health
unit
to
provide
the
care
for
the
indigent
and
have
a
city
county
help
officer
as
paid
partly
by
the
county
and
partly
by
the
city
and
provide
services
to
all
of
the
citizens
in
midland
county
regardless
of
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
it
is
but
city
also
is
a
taxing
authority,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
they
do
not.
none
of
them
go
to
the
state
capital
where
the
exception
of
the
recently
established
city
sales
tax
was
authorized
in
texas.
its
required
only
to
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
--
but
that's
not
in
this
case.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
but
none
of
it
goes
to
the
state
in
its
return.
it's
all
--
there
is
a
county,
tax
assessor,
and
collector.
there
is
a
city
county
tax
--
city
tax
assessor
and
collector.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
now,
it
is
the
position
of
the
petitioner
herein
that
the
one
man,
one
vote
principle
as
set
forth
in
reynolds
versus
sims
applies
to
the
governing
body
of
midland
county,
texas.
the
members
of
its
governing
body
are
elected
and
perform
both
legislative
and
administrative
functions.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
i
would,
your
honor.
my
opinion
is
that
this
matter
was
pretty
well
decided
--
what
were
decided
by
this
court
in
gray
versus
sanders,
and
i
feel
that
a
person
is
not
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
well,
my
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
--
recollection
was
it
involves
some
high
state
officials
other
than
just
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
that
was
my
understanding
of
it
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
it
certainly
is.
i
think
under
the
two
issues
decided
by
this
court
at
the
last
term,
the
sailors
case
and
the
dusch
case
that
it's
a
very
significant.
i
think
under
those
cases
is
that
they
were
not
elected.
that
this
doctrine
would
not
apply.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
they
could
by
constitutional
amendment
but
it
would
take
the
constitutional
amendment
and
of
course
--
well
we
never
have
constitutional
amendment
in
texas
is
by
two-thirds
vote
of
both
houses
submitted
the
vote
of
people
but
i
think
that
they
could,
yes,
sir.
i
don't
want
to
be
repetitious
on
this
pointed
out
some
of
the
duties
and
responsibilities
of
the
commissioners
court
but
i
think
for
the
continuity
of
this,
i'd
like
to
go
hardly
over
this.
article
v,
section
18
of
the
constitution
provides
that
the
commissioners
court
shall
have
such
powers
and
duties
overall
county
business
as
it's
established
by
the
constitution
in
the
states.
now,
i
would
point
out
that
this
time,
mr.
justice
stewart
made
a
mention
about
the
designation
of
this
body
as
a
court,
this
is
a
misnomer
and
the
supreme
court
of
texas
so
held
in
its
opinion
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
not
on
your
part,
your
honor.
on
the
part
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
it's
what's
called
but
it's
a
misnomer
according
to
the
supreme
court
of
texas
and
that
it
provides
no
judicial
functions
as
such.
it's
a
misnomer
that
was
placed
by
the
texas
constitution.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
your
honor.
and
of
course,
the
county
judge
does
perform
some
judicial
functions.
we
have
a
jurisdiction
governed
by
the
county
judge,
probate
manners,
and
then
within
$200
to
$500.
and
$500
and
$1000
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
that.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
not
in
texas.
the
county
judge
does
not
have
to
be
a
lawyer.
now,
the
county
commissioners
court
is
a
sole
governing
body
in
midland
county.
there
is
no
other
governing
body
of
midland
county.
now,
the
authority
of
the
setup
in
this
board
is
both
setup
by
the
constitution
and
setup
by
the
statute
but
the
constitution
says
it
--
it
says
it
shall
have
control
of
all
of
the
county
government.
as
i
pointed
out,
it
has
the
authority
of
taxation
to
set
tax
rates
set
as
a
board
of
equalization
to
adjust
the
ad
valorem
values
offered
then.
it
has
the
authority
to
establish
a
budget
which
in
the
trial
of
this
case
in
1963
was
something
under
$2
million.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
it
does
not.
we
have
two
independent
school
districts
in
midland
county,
midland
independent
and
great
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
that's
correct.
yes.
now,
in
regards
to
this
budget,
there's
some
very
significant
factors.
the
supreme
court
of
texas
in
its
opinion
said
that
there
were
some
case
countywide
of
officers
that
were
elected
by
all
of
the
people.
that's
true
in
the
county
there
--
that
perform
ministerial
functions
such
as
the
sheriff.
the
county
tax
assessor
and
collector,
the
district
clerk
in
the
county
survey.
but
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
sir?
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
in
a
probate
judge.
i
think
it's
very
significant
in
this
regard
that
the
salaries
of
these
officials
are
set
by
the
commissioners
court,
the
governing
body
of
midland
county,
and
the
salary
of
all
of
their
employees,
if
any,
set
by
the
commissioners
court.
so
if
the
commissioners
court
doesn't
feel
like
that
they
want
anything
other
than
a
sheriff
in
the
county,
they
can
just
not
approve
a
budget
for
any
deputies.
and
of
course,
the
same
thing
can
apply
to
tax
assessor
and
collector's
office,
and
so
forth
so
on.
in
fact,
they
established
a
budget
that
runs
all
of
the
government.
they
even
insofar
as
these
elected
officials
who
perform
ministerial
duties.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
they
have
the
same
authority
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
on
occasion
they
do,
yes
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes
sir,
they
perform
most
of
the
duties
outside
the
city.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
and
highway
patrol.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
well,
except
for
the
constable,
and
of
course,
they
do
have
the
designated
function
of
serving
all
judicial
papers.
the
city
police
force
has
no
authority
to
serve
any
judicial
papers
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes.
it
serves
the
police
--
the
municipal
corporation
court
in
midland
has
--
of
course,
the
police
officers
have
authority
to
serve
the
various
writs
in
connection
with
that
court.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
which
incidentally
has
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
the
justice
court,
the
precincts
of
which
are
established
by
the
county
commissioners
court.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
inside
or
outside,
200
--
misdemeanor
fine
is
$200
or
less
and
no
jail
sentence.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
i
would
say
it
would
be
about
the
same.
there
may
be
some
portion
of
that
that
was
received
from
the
state
of
texas
for
highway
or
road
construction
but
most
of
it
comes
from
taxes.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
the
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
the
testimony
in
this
case
show
that
approximately
65%
was
received
from
what
do
we
have
in
precinct
number
1,
which
is
the
city
of
midland.
and
the
remainder
came
from
precincts
number
2,
3,
and
4,
which
is
outside
the
city,
i
mean
65%.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
well,
it
would
be
hard
to
do,
your
honor.
however,
there
is
a
connected
with
this
record,
the
budget
of
the
city
of
midland
county
for
the
years
up
to
1964
which
would
show
that
where
the
expenditures
were
made,
now
of
course,
the
budget
would
not
disclose
what
portion
of
it
was
used
within
the
corporate
limits
of
the
city
of
midland.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
your
honor.
in
addition
to
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
there
is
a
substantial
suburban
area
outside
the
incorporated
limits
of
the
city
of
midland
which
is
in
commissioners
precinct
number
1.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
it's
pretty
well-established
by
the
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
i
don't
have
those
exact
figures
but
the
--
a
substantial
portion
of
it
or
the
large
portion
of
it
was
within
the
corporate
limits
of
the
city
of
midland
in
commissioner
precinct
number
1.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
it's
all
--
it's
also
in
commissioners
precinct
number
1.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
95%
of
the
population
–-
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
--
of
midland
county
is
in
commissioners
precinct
number
1.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
it's
not
exactly
right,
your
honor.
there
is
a
small
portion,
i
think,
they
have
this
in
this
case
show
about
400
people
live
inside
the
corporate
limits
of
the
city
of
midland
and
are
located
in
commissioners
precinct
number
4,
i
believe
it
is.
this
is
the
airport
when
the
city
of
midland
took
in
its
airport
it
run
a
land,
it
took
in
the
airport
and
it's
out
from
town.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
sir?
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
we
do
not
have
a
township,
this
is
an
incorporated
city
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
this
is
the
only
one.
the
city
of
midland
is
the
only
incorporated
city,
town
and
village
in
midland
county.
now,
in
addition
to
these
authorities
of
taxation
and
physical
--
fiscal
matters,
now
the
county
has
authority
to
create
a
hospital,
medical
care
for
the
indigent,
garbage
collection,
bearing
it
offers
these
various
similar
functions.
they
have
numerous
safety
functions
such
as
we
pointed
out
the
deputy
sheriff,
constables,
fire
protection.
they
have
the
authority
to
create
a
public
facility
such
as
public
libraries,
which
they
have
in
midland.
they
have
the
authority
to
create
airports,
public
housing,
waterworks,
park,
and
recreation
areas,
auditoriums,
coliseums,
and
the
sole
authority
to
either
create
these
or
not
to
create
these
in
the
governing
body
of
midland
county
texas.
they
have
the
authority
to
construct
bridges
and
roads
either
within
or
without
the
corporate
limits
of
the
city
of
midland
and
they
have
the
general
authority
of
eminent
domain.
they
have
authority
to
issue
in
both
--
to
issue
and
sell
bonds,
and
to
control
the
subdivision
of
land
throughout
the
county.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
that's
a
--
it
may
be
construed
as
zoning
in
the
sense,
your
honor.
the
statute
provides
that
before
land
can
be
sold
according
now
as
lot
and
block
rather
than
the
general
type
field
note
descriptions,
the
plan
must
be
filed
of
record
with
the
county
clerk.
now,
the
plan
cannot
be
file
a
record
with
the
county
clerk
if
it's
located
outside
in
the
incorporated
city
town
or
village
or
within
five
miles
unless
it's
approved
by
the
county
commissioners
court.
they,
in
this,
can
require
such
thing
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
no,
sir.
out
--
if
it's
located
inside
the
city,
it
does
not
have
to
be
approved
by
the
county
commissioners
court.
but
it's
located
outside
the
city
and
not
within
five
miles
to
the
city,
it
must
be
approved
by
the
county
commissioners
court
and
they
can
require
a
certain
portion
of
this
area
to
be
set
aside
for
park
and
recreation
purposes,
a
certain
portion
to
be
set
aside
for
roads,
and
that
sort
of
thing
before
they
would
approve
the
plan.
now,
there
are
several
significant
facts
that
are
firmly
established
in
this
case.
one
is
that
the
governing
body
of
midland
county
is
important
in
the
lives
of
all
of
the
citizens
of
the
county.
the
governing
body
of
midland
county
performs
legislative
and
administrative
functions
that
daily
affect
the
lives
and
welfare
of
all
the
citizens.
the
governing
body
of
midland
county
is
controlled
by
less
than
5%
of
the
people
who
elect
three
members
to
the
governing
body.
there
is
no
effective
way
for
the
voice
of
over
95%
of
the
citizens
of
midland
county
to
be
heard
insofar
as
our
county
governing
body
is
concerned
since
they
can
elect
only
one
member
to
the
commissioners
court.
and
we
feel
that
this
condition
will
remain
unless
it's
changed
by
this
court.
now,
it's
the
position
of
the
petitioner
here
that
each
citizen
of
midland
county
is
entitled
to
an
equal
vote
in
the
election
of
the
county
governing
body.
how
else
can
we
have
representative
government?
we
earnestly
submit
that
each
man
regardless
of
the
color
of
his
skin
or
the
cut
of
his
coat
or
the
place
of
his
residence
is
entitled
to
an
equal
vote.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
yes,
sir.
actually
97%
of
the
qualified
--
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
fortas
prior
to
the
luncheon
recess
have
asked
me
a
question
in
regard
to
the
--
whether
or
not
there
were
some
rationale
for
providing
the
governing
body
for
midland
county
in
regard
insofar
as
the
rural
population
is
concerned.
in
answer
sir
to
that
question,
my
statement
would
be
that
article
v,
section
18
the
texas
constitution
provides
that
the
commissioners
precinct
line
shall
be
changed
from
time
to
time
for
the
convenience
of
the
people.
it
doesn't
say
rural
people
and
it
doesn't
say
urban
people.
i
feel
that
the
governing
body
of
midland
county
affects
all
of
the
people
of
county
and
it
should
be
divided
accordingly.
i
would
point
out
that
apparently
this
same
question
was
raised
before
the
court
in
reynolds
versus
sims
that
if
the
“one
man,
one
vote”
principle
were
applied
and
the
voice
of
the
rural
area
would
be
heard.
the
court
in
that
case
provided
that
we
are
advised
that
states
can
rationally
considers
the
facts
other
than
population
in
apportioning
legislation
representation.
our
answer
is
this,
a
denial
of
the
constitutionally
protected
rights
demand
judicial
protection.
our
oath
in
our
office
require
no
less
to
the
extent
that
the
citizen's
right
to
vote
is
the
base,
he
is
that
much
less
a
citizen.
the
fact
that
a
citizen
lives
here
or
there
is
not
a
legitimate
reason
for
overweighting
or
deluding
his
vote.
a
citizen,
a
qualified
voter
is
no
more
or
no
less
so
because
he
lives
in
the
city
or
on
a
farm.
this
is
a
clear
and
strong
command
of
our
constitution
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
if
it
please
the
court,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
logic
as
so
clearly
set
forth
in
reynolds
versus
sims
is
applicable
to
the
county
government
of
midland
county
texas.
mr.
lyndon
l.
olson
we
have
nothing
further,
your
honor.
