justice

black
how
does
the
county
fix
the
rate?
you
said
fixes
the
rate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
commissioners
what?
so
that's
some
what
percentage
of
the
real
estate
value
or
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
property
value?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
applies
in
the
city
of
midland?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
mean
by
fixing
the
rate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you
say
fix
the
rate?
do
you
mean
that
the
legislative
body
provides
that
the
citizens
of
that
county
to
pay
a
fix
rate
on
that
real
estate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
can
repeal
the
tax
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
required
to
do
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
the
basic
rate
is
fixed
by
the
state
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
the
constitution
say
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
would
be
a
different
courts
that
fixing
the
rate
to
the
administration.
the
tax
assessor
would
do
that.
that
wouldn't
be
levied
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
--
it's
totally
the
standard
legislative
functions
that
the
board
exercises?
justice
hugo
l.
black
constable
says
that
in
precinct,
is
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
have
a
justice
of
the
peace?
should
have
a
justice
of
the
peace
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
constable
serves
this
basis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
judge
would
believe
it
must
be
a
lawyer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
judged?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
they
judged,
all
of
those?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
could
be
taken
into
account,
couldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
read
out
formal
cases
that
require
population
that
these
are
predominant
considerations?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
give
me
a
court
opinion
as
telling
the
lower
courts
to
redistrict
with
basis
--
with
the
--
on
the
basis
that
population
is
a
predominant
consideration?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
see
what
difference
it
would
leave.
what
i'm
asking
you
if
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
your
judgment
leaves
the
trial
court
free
to
redistrict
always
having
in
mind
that
population
is
the
predominant
consideration.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
have
this
meaning
that
it
must
be
the
predominant
consideration?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
say
--
do
you
construe
this
meaning
if
they
can
consider
other
factors
even
though
that
prevents
population
being
a
predominant
consideration?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
that's
really
the
difference
between
you
and
you're
your
court
has
found
and
what
the
trial
opinions
have
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
that
the
predominant
thing
that
we
directed
must
be
considered?
justice
hugo
l.
black
predominantly?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
substituting
--
is
that
not
substituting
the
idea
of
reasonable
basis,
a
non-arbitrary
basis
for
the
test
that
we
put
in
our
cases
that
the
first
consideration
must
be
population?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
if
the
state
at
this
injunction
if
you
will,
easier,
it
would
be
easier.
you
have
four
precincts,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
four
districts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
would
you
mind
telling
me
how
many
voters
there
are
in
each
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what
you
have
is
a
system
in
which
three
of
the
four
of
the
majority
of
the
controlling
body
of
the
county
elected
by
5%
of
the
voters.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
--
i
thought
you
said
war?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
way
it's
divided
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
it's
not
decided
of
that
recording
with
the
predominant
consideration
being
given
population,
why
would
it
be
that
way
again?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
do
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you're
arguing
something
like
this,
against
the
states
create
the
county.
the
states
can
operate
without
the
county
as
it
desires.
it
could
operate
with
agents
of
the
state.
and
that
it
could
appoint
four
people
to
run
the
affairs
as
the
agent
of
the
state.
it
need
not
have
an
election
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that's
the
basic
principle
on
which
you
are
arguing
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
let's
assume
that's
true.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
state
does
not
chose
to
operate
in
that
fashion
but
chooses
to
operate
by
creating
governments
where
the
people
are
subjected
to
the
government
of
those
elected
by
them,
would
your
argument
apply
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
interested
in
your
equal
protection
argument.
i
agree
with
you
at
the
beginning,
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
control
the
county
created
if
it
sees
fit
and
to
control
the
people
in
that
type
of
that,
but
do
you
agree
that
law
passed
by
the
constitution
of
the
state
are
just
as
much
subject
to
the
federal
constitution
has
any
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
that
is
true
and
you
do
have
a
system
setting
up
an
election,
whether
it
might
or
it
might
not
value
the
equal
protection
clause.
how
can
you
say
that
the
equal
protection
clause
which
is
an
amendment
which
says
that
no
state
surpass
the
law
of
denying
equal
protection?
it
doesn't
apply
to
state
laws
made
by
the
constitution
the
same
as
it
does
state
law
is
made
by
the
legislature.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
you
do
not
proceed
with
your
argument
that
the
equal
protection
clause
is
not
applicable
to
a
law
in
effect
particularly
to
its
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
equal
protection
clause
must
be
considered,
must
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
determining
whether
or
not
in
setting
up
this
system
of
coding.
the
state
has
denied
equal
protection
to
be
considered.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
get
back
to
that
question
after
all,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
held
as
i
understood
it
more
that
in
absolute
equality
is
impossible.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
you
should
approximate
that
equality.
and
then
approximating
that
equality,
you
can
consider
other
matters
relevant
in
order
to
make
this
merely
the
same
as
possible,
but
that
always
that
should
be
the
agency,
the
idea
of
the
equal
one
vote
or
one
person
so
near
as
it's
possible.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
you
are
arguing
here
is
that
that
held
it
with
reference
to
certain
state
elections.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
it
should
not
be
carried
down
to
local
elections?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
is
an
appealing
argument
but
i
have
not
yet
heard
you
tell
us
why
we
could
do
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
it
could
by
considering
the
fact
that
the
state
has
power
to
govern
its
county
as
it
sees
fit
but
does
it
--
if
it
does
have
power
to
govern
its
county
as
it
sees
fit
have
a
right
to
conduct
election
in
a
way
which
deprives
part
of
the
people
of
therefore
privileged
voters.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
remote
nothing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
local
county
school
board
went
one
step
further,
didn't
it?
it
held
that
the
officials
of
those
districts
couldn't
do
the
electing.
the
officials
of
those
districts,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
kind
of
a
county
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
we
say
that
the
logic
or
reasoning,
maybe
we
could
but
how
could
we
that
you
must
apply
that
rule
with
the
election
of
the
governor.
you
must
apply
to
the
election
of
a
senator
or
a
congressman
but
you
need
not
apply
to
the
election
of
local
officials
that
touched
the
lives
of
the
people
and
that
this
might
as
the
larger
officials?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
we
ever
applied
the
rule
yet?
an
official
who
is
not
in
some
way
recognized
directly
or
indirectly
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
one
vote,
one
person
in
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
another
way,
--
in
a
way,
it's
an
absolute
subject
in
a
difficult
case.
problems
are
articulated
but--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
would
assume
that
if
there
is
in
the
government,
it
can
be
viewed
to
the
fact
of
the
basic
principle
of
this
country
that
there's
a
difference
between
the
state
and
federal
government,
and
that
he
had
to
forward
if
it's
true.
we
have
only
applied
this
principle
to
officials
of
such
level
and
dignity,
they
have
been
in
some
way
recognized
as
officials
by
the
federal
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
not
extend
in
connection
with
elections
or?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
elections
do
they
indicate
where
the
alignment
be
drawn?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
to
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
people
who
said
justice
of
the
peacemakers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
little
precinct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
state
--
your
argument
would
take
them
out,
would
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
have
an
election
--
if
you
have
an
election
and
picture
them
in
some
way
where
everybody
doesn't
have
an
equal
vote,
would
apply
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
were
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
still
--
you
would
argue
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
you
are
trying
to
draw
a
line
and
you
are
seeking
to
draw
a
line,
isn't
it
especially
if
you're
on
the
statewide
level,
those
who
recognize
by
the
constitution
which
of
great
importance
to
the
state
and
nation
and
those
who
are
peculiar
live
within
the
range
of
the
state's
activities
perform
the

practically
state
duties
for
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
does
the
county
fix
the
rate?
you
said
fixes
the
rate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
commissioners
what?
so
that's
some
what
percentage
of
the

value

--
justice

property

that
applies
in

justice

yes.
justice

black
and
you
mean
by
fixing
the
rate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you
say
fix
the

do
you
mean
that
the
legislative

provides
that
the

county
to
pay

on

justice

they
can
repeal

law?
justice

black
it's
required
to
do
that.
justice

so
that

so
that
equal
protection
clause
must
be
considered,
must
it
not?
justice

l.
black
in
determining
whether
or
not
in
setting
up
this
system
of
coding.
the
state
has
denied
equal
protection
to
be
considered.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
get
back
to
that
question
after
all,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
held
as
i
understood
it
more
that
in
absolute
equality
is
impossible.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
you
should
approximate
that
equality.
and
then
approximating
that
equality,
you
can
consider
other
matters
relevant
in
order
to
make
this
merely
the
same
as
possible,
but
that
always
that
should
be
the
agency,
the
idea
of
the
equal
one
vote
or
one
person
so
near
as
it's
possible.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
you
are
arguing
here
is
that
that
held
it
with
reference
to
certain
state
elections.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
it
should
not
be
carried
down
to
local
elections?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
is
an
appealing
argument
but
i
have
not
yet
heard
you
tell
us
why
we
could
do
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
it
could
by
considering
the
fact
that
the
state
has
power
to
govern
its
county
as
it
sees
fit
but
does
it
--
if
it
does
have
power
to
govern
its
county
as
it
sees
fit
have
a
right
to
conduct
election
in
a
way
which
deprives
part
of
the
people
of
therefore
privileged
voters.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
remote
nothing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
local
county
school
board
went
one
step
further,
didn't
it?
it
held
that
the
officials
of
those
districts
couldn't
do
the
electing.
the
officials
of
those
districts,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
kind
of
a
county
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
we
say
that
the
logic
or
reasoning,
maybe
we
could
but
how
could
we
that
you
must
apply
that
rule
with
the
election
of
the
governor.
you
must
apply
to
the
election
of
a
senator
or
a
congressman
but
you
need
not
apply
to
the
election
of
local
officials
that
touched
the
lives
of
the
people
and
that
this
might
as
the
larger
officials?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
we
ever
applied
the
rule
yet?
an
official
who
is
not
in
some
way
recognized
directly
or
indirectly
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
one
vote,
one
person
in
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
another
way,
--
in
a
way,
it's
an
absolute
subject
in
a
difficult
case.
problems
are
articulated
but--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
would
assume
that
if
there
is
in
the
government,
it
can
be
viewed
to
the
fact
of
the
basic
principle
of
this
country
that
there's
a
difference
between
the
state
and
federal
government,
and
that
he
had
to
forward
if
it's
true.
we
have
only
applied
this
principle
to
officials
of
such
level
and
dignity,
they
have
been
in
some
way
recognized
as
officials
by
the
federal
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
not
extend
in
connection
with
elections
or?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
elections
do
they
indicate
where
the
alignment
be
drawn?
justice

justice

yes,

precinct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
state
--
your
argument
would
take
them
out,
would
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
have
an
election
--
if
you
have
an
election
and
picture
them
in
some
way
where
everybody
doesn't
have
an
equal
vote,
would
apply
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
were
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
still
--
you
would
argue
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
you
are
trying
to
draw
a
line
and
you
are
seeking
to
draw
a
line,
isn't
it
especially
if
you're
on
the
statewide
level,
those
who
recognize
by
the
constitution
which
of
great
importance
to
the
state
and
nation
and
those
who
are
peculiar

within

range

activities

practically
state
duties
for
the
state.
