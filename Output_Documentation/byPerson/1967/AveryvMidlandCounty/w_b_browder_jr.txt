mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
this
case
has
in
it
certain
drawn
issues,
narrow
issues,
if
you
please.
this
involves
midland
county
texas
and
the
question
as
to
what
midland
county
can
be
subdivided
as
directed
by
the
texas
supreme
court
without
considering
solely
equal
population.
this
case
is
not
what
might
be
called
a
one
man,
one
vote
case.
in
fact,
your
honors,
we
do
not
find
one
man,
one
vote
as
a
rule
of
reynolds
versus
sims.
we
tried
to
say
that
the
rule
of
reynolds
versus
sims
is
what
is
said
by
this
court
in
the
dusch
versus
davis
case.
when
this
court
said
on
the
assumption
that
reynolds
versus
sims
controls
the
constitutional
test
under
the
equal
protection
clause
is
whether
there
has
been
invidious
discrimination.
we
believe
that
the
question
here
is
and
first
to
be
decided
is
whether
the
court
has
jurisdiction,
possibly
that
has
been
decided
finally
against
respondent.
in
any
event,
it
is
a
question
because
this
case
has
been
sent
back
to
the
trial
court.
in
texas,
that's
a
district
court
and
the
commissioners
court
for
division
of
this
county
without
discrimination.
the
texas
supreme
court
has
said
that
under
the
united
states
constitution
and
the
texas
constitution,
there
cannot
be
division
of
the
counties
in
a
discriminatory
manner.
that
is
invidious
discrimination
or
as
we
read
the
opinions
the
vision
without
reason.
the
texas
supreme
court
has
followed
what
we
believe
is
the
law
and
ordered
a
remand
of
the
course
for
division
of
the
county
into
four
precincts;
population
and
other
factors,
in
other
words,
division
with
population
in
mind
and
without
discrimination.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
certainly.
if
the
county
commissioners
divide
midland
county
into
four
precincts,
considering
the
convenience
of
the
people,
considering
population,
and
reasonable
consideration,
reasonable
factors,
then
the
district
court
would
first
decide
whether
there
had
been
invidious
discrimination.
then
if
the
district
court
passed
upon
the
matter
then
on
the
appellate
courts
in
texas.
in
other
words,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
asked,
what
is
the
status
of
this
course
now?
we
believe
that's
the
first
question
for
the
court.
i
don't
want
to
dissect
the
question
because
the
question
here
is,
“does
this
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
wish
to
say
“we
will
not
permit
this
matter
to
be
decided
by
the
texas
courts
on
the
basis
outlined
by
the
texas
supreme
court?”
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
i
want
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
think
that's
rather
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
that's
right.
and
now,
as
mr.
justice
fortas
raised
the
question
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
believe
i
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
do,
if
you
apply
the
rule
to
the
substate
governments.
your
honor
please,
we
take
position
here.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
think
the
texas
supreme
court
has
said
to
the
lower
courts,
“you
must
have
population
in
mind.”
under
the
texas
court,
i
believe
it
does.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
believe
it
does.
but
now
i
want
to
say
that
the
texas
supreme
court
says
that
you
can
consider
other
factors.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
i
want
to
come
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
doubt
it.
i
would
say
this
that
they
could
consider
other
factors.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
don't
believe
there's
any
difference
between
what
this
court's
opinion
has
said
and
what
the
supreme
court
says.
i
think
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
says,
“we
look
to
see
if
there's
invidious
discrimination,
not
merely
one
man,
one
vote.”
i
believe
that's
what
the
texas
supreme
court
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
think
it
must
be
considered.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
believe
so.
but
i
do
not
believe
solely
and
only.
i
want
to
get
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question
because
i
think
that's
the
narrow
issue
here
that
he
has
asked.
the
texas
supreme
court
disagreed
with
the
trial
court.
the
texas
supreme
court
says
that
this
court's
opinions
do
not
require
that
the
county
in
every
case,
those
words
are
used,
your
honor,
by
the
texas
supreme
court,
that
the
254
texas
counties
do
not
have
to
be
divided
in
every
case
solely
on
equal
population
basis.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
this
is
important,
we
believe,
for
this
reason.
the
petitioner
has
squarely
joined
issue
with
respondent
on
this
question.
petitioner
realizes
that
the
texas
supreme
court
has
reversed
and
remanded
this
course
to
be
divided
without
discrimination,
divided
on
a
rational
basis.
petitioner
brought
the
case
here
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
believe
there's
a
big
difference,
reasonable
difference.
when
this
court
says
that
the
question,
as
we
understand
the
court
in
dusch
to
sailors,
the
question
is
not
one
man,
one
vote,
the
question
is
whether
there
is
invidious
discrimination.
let
me
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
believe
so
as
i
understand
your
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
am
speaking
only
for
midland
county
as
it
gets
three
or
three
county
commissioners,
if
you
please,
and
midland
county,
not
for
the
other
texas
counties.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
think
that's
exactly
what
it
means,
your
honor.
your
honor
please,
i
did
not
want
to
equivocate
in
answering
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
there's
only
one
question
before
this
court.
if
your
honor,
i
believe
you
phrased
it
in
prior
argument,
the
only
ruling
made
by
the
texas
supreme
court
which
is
the
law
of
this
case.
and
if
that
be
a
final
judgment,
then
so
it
be.
and
that
is
the
one
question
for
decision
here
and
we
believe
the
only
question.
the
one
holding
that's
the
law
of
this
case.
we
disagree
with
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
in
its
requirement
that
midland
county
be
redistricted
into
commissioners
precincts
solely
upon
the
basis
on
population.
that
is
what
i've
tried
to
get
over.
that's
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
that
is
the
issue.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
your
honor,
let
me
first
say
as
i've
tried
to
say
before
as
i
understood
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
think
the
first
question
that
must
be
decided,
will
this
court
say,
the
texas
courts
will
not
follow
the
law?
the
texas
trial
court
or
commissioners
court
and
the
district
court
will
not
follow
the
texas
supreme
court.
the
trial
court
will
permit
discrimination.
the
texas
appellate
courts
will
permit
discrimination.
is
this
court
going
to
say
that
first,
because
you
have
before
you
now,
not
an
appeal
from
any
final
judgment?
you
do
have
before
you
an
appeal
from
a
texas
supreme
court
which
we
must
admit.
thus,
make
the
law
of
this
particular
case.
so
that
if
the
court
wishes
to
step
into
this
case
at
this
time,
which
apparently
it
does
having
granted
the
petition.
then
the
question
arises,
are
we
to
hold
that
in
every
substate
government
in
texas,
every
one
of
the
counties
in
texas
there
must
be
a
division
solely
on
equal
population?
your
honor,
this
in
texas
in
west
texas,
we
were
in
the
middle
of
west
texas.
we
have
county
after
county.
we
have
counties
larger
than
any
state.
we
have
counties
brewster
county
with
alpine
as
its
county
seat.
the
big
bend
country
with
their
presidio,
the
county
seat,
one
town
in
a
county
with
thousands
of
miles
of
ranches
and
farms.
are
we
going
to
say
that
every
one
of
these
counties
must
be
divided
with
precincts
centering
in
the
town,
centering
in
the
city
because
you
cannot
otherwise
divide
these
counties?
midland
county
cannot
be
divided
into
four
precincts
of
equal
population
unless
you
put
the
center
of
that
division
in
the
city
of
midland
and
let
the
city,
and
let
everyone
of
the
commissioners.
that
is
what
the
texas
supreme
court
was
talking
about,
we
believe.
your
honor
please,
let
me
for
just
a
few
remarks
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
if
you
permitted
precincts
to
some
extent,
yes.
but
this
is
safeguard
against
that
and
that
hasn't
been
called
at
this
court's
attention.
mr.
chief
justice,
you
asked
the
question
here
earlier,
who
levies
the
taxes
for
the
county's
business?
you
we're
told
that
the
commissioners
court
had
the
authority.
that
is
true.
you
asked,
who
are
handles
these
salaries
finally?
i
know
in
the
particular
at
work,
this
is
a
commissioners
court
and
a
system
of
government
of
courts,
of
judicial
bodies.
anything
the
commissioners
court
thus
is
subject
to
supervision
and
control
of
the
district
court.
may
i
elaborate
upon
that
for
just
a
minute?
in
texas,
we
have
the
texas
supreme
court
and
equal
with
it,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
the
texas
supreme
court
under
it,
our
courts
of
civil
appeals,
16
or
18
of
them.
under
that,
we
have
the
district
court
such
as
a
trial
court
or
the
circuit
court
in
so
many
states.
but
under
article
v,
section
8
of
the
texas
constitution,
the
district
court
is
given
supervision
and
control
over
the
commissioners
court.
the
same
article
of
our
constitution
sets
up
the
commissioners
court
which
has
many
judicial
functions,
many
judicial
functions.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
yes,
sir.
if
it
is
discriminatory.
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
or
that
they
have
penalized
some
and
favored
others,
anything
where
discrimination
is
shown.
your
honor
please,
you
we're
told
that
the
commissioners
court
has
legislative
functions,
the
fixing
of
taxes.
this
court
we
thought
fast
on
that
in
the
sailors
suit.
that
just
a
mere
--
that
was
a
boarder,
the
school
board,
the
mere
ability
to
tax
is
not
strictly
legislative,
i
thought
we
read
that.
but
here
we
would
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
believe
they
did
in
part,
yes
sir.
but
the
court
said
this
day
that
this
is
not
a
legislative
board,
if
that
makes
the
difference.
we
believe
it
does.
let
me
go
to
one
other
point.
you
were
told
that
this
court
had
legislative
functions
because
it
divided
the
county
or
could
divide
the
county
into
four
precincts.
to
me
this
is
a
judicial
function.
no
better
proofs
of
the
control
of
the
people
have
than
this
very
redistricting
or
districting
of
the
county.
this
county
was
redistricted
and
a
direct
appeal
to
the
district
court,
the
district
judge
elected
by
the
people
throughout
the
county.
these
are
set
up
in
texas
is
for
all
the
people
of
the
county.
the
city
runs
nine-tenths
of
the
election
votes
now.
under
the
texas
law,
you
have
as
the
arm
of
the
state
the
county
and
its
officers.
you
have
the
district
judge,
elected
countywide.
he
has
the
supervision
of
this
commissioners
court.
you
have
the
county
judge,
elected
countywide.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
the
county
judge?
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
he
cannot
if
this
it's
two
and
two.
however,
he
can
exercise
influence,
the
chief
judge
of
the
court
bringing
up
matters
or
not
bringing
them
up
and
having
them
where
he
does
see
fit.
but
more
important,
your
honor,
in
a
county
where
you
have
a
city
such
as
midland,
where
there
are
60,000
people,
50,000,
40,000
votes.
there
is
a
great
weight
on
any
of
these
commissioners.
by
the
varying
numbers
of
the
city
voters,
if
you
please,
by
the
county
judge,
the
county
sheriff,
elected
countywide.
you
talk
about
the
commissioners
court
having
authority.
you
see
what
we
get
into
when
we
argue
about
the
commissioners
court
of
texas.
you
have
the
gentleman
here
in
and
utmost
good
faith
arguing
texas
statutes.
and
then
you
have
us
for
the
respondents
arguing
texas
statutes.
we
submit
that
the
texas
statutes
have
been
construed
by
the
texas
supreme
court.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
four
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
at
the
present
time,
about
95%
of
the
voters
in
the
city
of
midland
precinct
1,
about
5%
or
6%
in
the
other
three
precincts,
about
2%
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
your
honor
please,
we've
already
allot
--
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
we
have
lost
that
war.
the
texas
supreme
court
has
held
against
us
in
that
point.
we
do
not
have
that
--
sir?
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
it
is
since
1963
and
this
matter
went
to
the
court.
the
texas
supreme
court
entered
its
order,
it
was
brought
here.
we
have
not
recommended
or
i
will
say
the
commissioners
court
has
not
change,
i
don't
know
what
to
do
yet
until
this
case
is
decided
here.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
because
the
texas
court
will
not
permit
under
its
present
decision.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
we
can't
do
anything
else,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
under
the
supreme
court
of
texas
opinion,
we
thought
we
knew
what
we
had
to
do
or
rather
what
the
commissioners
court
had
to
do.
when
it
comes
near,
if
you
hold
that
the
county
must
be
divided
solely
on
equal
population
basis,
it
will
be
so
divided.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
think
that
we
are
supposed
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
then
to
the
commissioners
court.
i
was
to
be
clear
about
that.
i
think
that
texas
supreme
court
had
to
send
it
back
to
the
commissioners
court
just
as
this
court
would
send
to
a
federal
district
court.
i
don't
know
that
you
might
go
through
a
court
of
appeals.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
now,
when
you
get
to
the
commissioners
court,
those
four
gentlemen
are
going
to
have
to
follow
the
law
as
made
by
this
opinion.
and
they
are
going
to
be
advised
that
this
is
the
law.
we
are
all
lawyers.
we
are
all
houses
of
the
court.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
now,
then
these
commissioners
whether
they
divide
solely
on
a
population
basis
or
take
into
consideration
roads,
the
amounts
of
roads
and
things
like
that,
of
course,
is
up
to
them.
and
i
cannot
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
it
is
up
to
them
what
division
they
make
based
on
population
and
in
consideration
to
other
factors.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
no,
they
did
not.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
you
must
consider
population
and
equality
of
population.
you
may
consider
as
making
a
variance
of
equal
population,
this
matter
of
roads,
taxable
value,
and
preserving
the
voice
of
the
rural
people.
now,
i
don't
want
to
digest
the
issue
either.
we
believe
that
the
voice
of
the
rural
people
must
be
preserved
to
some
extent.
i
do
not
take
the
solicitor
general's
brief
to
be
at
the
contrary.
now,
the
petitioner
is,
petitioner
takes
the
position
as
i
understand
it
that
in
every
county,
there
must
be
division
solely
on
equality
of
population.
we
believe
that
as
was
shown
in
hearing,
this
commissioners
court
had
hearings,
town
hall
meetings
practically
for
about
six
days.
they
heard
different
recommendations.
one
of
them
was,
“well,
in
this
county
let's
have
two
precincts
in
the
city
and
two
in
the
county.”
maybe
they
would
do
that.
i
don't
know
what
this
commissioners
court
would
do.
there
was
one
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
yes,
sir,
they
could.
they
might
take
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
they
would
have
to
bring
the
two
country
in
their
apartment.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
not
very
good.
now,
the
other
plan
was
and
the
one
that
might
well
be
considered
fair
by
the
texas
court
is
three
commissioners
precincts
in
the
city
and
one
in
the
country,
which
is
solicitor
general
even
suggested.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
four
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
--
three
--
four
constitutionally
under
the
texas
constitution.
answering
your
honor's
question,
i
cannot
presume
to
say
what
this
court,
this
lower
court
would
do.
i
would
not
attempt
to
do
but
i
say
this,
if
there
is
discrimination,
these
petitioners
have
their
remedy
in
the
texas
court
unless
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
do
not
want
to.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
mr.
pannill
wishes
to
argue
that
it
does
not
apply.
and
if
you
will
permit
it,
we
will
argue
that
it
does
not
apply.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
your
honor,
we
believe
that
we
can
argue
that
reynolds
versus
sims
and
baker
versus
carr
should
not
be
applied
to
substate
governments.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
we
do
want
to
argue
that.
mr.
pannill
will
argue
it.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
the
texas
supreme
court
says
that
under
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
texas
and
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
there
has
been
discrimination
here.
under
the
two
constitutions,
we
do
not
believe
the
state
is
required
or
that
the
state
law
requires
that
the
county
commissioners
be
divided
into
four
precincts
in
every
case
solely
on
population.
we
say
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
think
it
is
not
inconsistent.
it
might
be
a
better
phrase.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
it.
my
argument
that
i
have
tried
to
present
–-
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
insofar
as
it
would
apply
one
man,
one
vote,
i
would
have
to
say,
no.
insofar
as
it
requires
no
invidious
discrimination,
i
would
say,
yes.
i'm
not
trying
to
equivocate
with
your
honor.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
think
the
texas
supreme
court
has
said
that.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
think
that
the
texas
supreme
court
has
said
that
and
that
that
would
be
a
big
factor
in
determining
whether
it
had
been
in
indiscrimination.
i
think
that
is
a
fair
amount
factor
in
determining
the
texas
constitution
uses
the
words
“for
the
convenience
of
the
people”.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
and
we
also
have
a
clause
in
our
constitution
about
republican
form
of
government.
i
think
it
would
violate
these,
if
it
does
violence
to
the
--
with
no
consideration
to
population.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
personally
think
it
must.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
don't
know.
i
think
the
court
meant
you
will
consider
population
as
what
it
says.
you
may
vary
from
population
if
you
have
good
grounds
and
reason
to
do
so.
so
i
think
that
meant
you
must
give
--
i
think
the
word
predominant
would
be
correct.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
i
would
not.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
right.
your
honor,
as
i
say,
the
second
part
of
our
argument
which
we
thought
proper
to
get
first,
because
we
did
pick
it
up
from
the
latter
opinions.
we
say
only
assumption,
the
reynolds
versus
sims
control.
then
the
constitutional
test
is
whether
there's
invidious
discrimination
and
under
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court,
petitioner
has
failed
to
show
discrimination
unless,
your
honors
please,
unless
this
court
is
to
now
hold
that
in
every
case,
the
commissioners
courts
of
texas
must
be
divided
solely
on
a
population
basis.
may
i
say
this;
i
was
really
very
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
mean
that
was
a
large
part
of
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
meant
that
he
has
failed
to
show
discrimination
and
that
this
case
is
ordered
back
to
the
trial
court
to
divide
without
discrimination.
that's
where
it
is
but,
i
added
this.
and
we
must
admit
this
opinion
by
the
texas
supreme
court
will
be
the
law
of
the
case
in
the
trial
court.
so
the
law
of
the
case
as
made
by
the
texas
supreme
court
is
you
will
consider
this
population.
you
will
consider
the
states
--
the
united
states
constitution.
but
you
do
not
have
to
be
confined
to
this
straitjacket
of
dividing
solely
on
equal
population.
now,
petitioner
says
that
has
discrimination.
petitioner
must
take
the
position
that
is
itself
invidious
discrimination
unless
you
will
give
division
on
equal
population
alone,
as
a
matter
of
law
you
have
invidious
discrimination.
now,
this
is
not
the
issue
as
i
understand
it
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
yes
sir,
we
do.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
mr.
pannill,
i
ask
you
to
do
that
now.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
may
he
argue
on
that,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
this
case
has
in
it
certain
drawn
issues,
narrow
issues,
if
you
please.
this
involves
midland
county
texas
and
the
question
as
to
what
midland
county
can
be
subdivided
as
directed
by
the
texas
supreme
court
without
considering
solely
equal
population.
this
case
is
not
what
might
be
called
a
one
man,
one
vote
case.
in
fact,
your
honors,
we
do
not
find
one
man,
one
vote
as
a
rule
of
reynolds
versus
sims.
we
tried
to
say
that
the
rule
of
reynolds
versus
sims
is
what
is
said
by
this
court
in
the
dusch
versus
davis
case.
when
this
court
said
on
the
assumption
that
reynolds
versus
sims
controls
the
constitutional
test
under
the
equal
protection
clause
is
whether
there
has
been
invidious
discrimination.
we
believe
that
the
question
here
is
and
first
to
be
decided
is
whether
the
court
has
jurisdiction,
possibly
that
has
been
decided
finally
against
respondent.
in
any
event,
it
is
a
question
because
this
case
has
been
sent
back
to
the
trial
court.
in
texas,
that's
a
district
court
and
the
commissioners
court
for
division
of
this
county
without
discrimination.
the
texas
supreme
court
has
said
that
under
the
united
states
constitution
and
the
texas
constitution,
there
cannot
be
division
of
the
counties
in
a
discriminatory
manner.
that
is
invidious
discrimination
or
as
we
read
the
opinions
the
vision
without
reason.
the
texas
supreme
court
has
followed
what
we
believe
is
the
law
and
ordered
a
remand
of
the
course
for
division
of
the
county
into
four
precincts;
population
and
other
factors,
in
other
words,
division
with
population
in
mind
and
without
discrimination.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
certainly.
if
the
county
commissioners
divide
midland
county
into
four
precincts,
considering
the
convenience
of
the
people,
considering
population,
and
reasonable
consideration,
reasonable
factors,
then
the
district
court
would
first
decide
whether
there
had
been
invidious
discrimination.
then
if
the
district
court
passed
upon
the
matter
then
on
the
appellate
courts
in
texas.
in
other
words,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
asked,
what
is
the
status
of
this
course
now?
we
believe
that's
the
first
question
for
the
court.
i
don't
want
to
dissect
the
question
because
the
question
here
is,
“does
this
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
wish
to
say
“we
will
not
permit
this
matter
to
be
decided
by
the
texas
courts
on
the
basis
outlined
by
the
texas
supreme
court?”
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
i
want
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
think
that's
rather
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
that's
right.
and
now,
as
mr.
justice
fortas
raised
the
question
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
believe
i
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
do,
if
you
apply
the
rule
to
the
substate
governments.
your
honor
please,
we
take
position
here.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
think
the
texas
supreme
court
has
said
to
the
lower
courts,
“you
must
have
population
in
mind.”
under
the
texas
court,
i
believe
it
does.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
believe
it
does.
but
now
i
want
to
say
that
the
texas
supreme
court
says
that
you
can
consider
other
factors.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
i
want
to
come
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
doubt
it.
i
would
say
this
that
they
could
consider
other
factors.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
don't
believe
there's
any
difference
between
what
this
court's
opinion
has
said
and
what
the
supreme
court
says.
i
think
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
says,
“we
look
to
see
if
there's
invidious
discrimination,
not
merely
one
man,
one
vote.”
i
believe
that's
what
the
texas
supreme
court
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
think
it
must
be
considered.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
believe
so.
but
i
do
not
believe
solely
and
only.
i
want
to
get
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question
because
i
think
that's
the
narrow
issue
here
that
he
has
asked.
the
texas
supreme
court
disagreed
with
the
trial
court.
the
texas
supreme
court
says
that
this
court's
opinions
do
not
require
that
the
county
in
every
case,
those
words
are
used,
your
honor,
by
the
texas
supreme
court,
that
the
254
texas
counties
do
not
have
to
be
divided
in
every
case
solely
on
equal
population
basis.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
this
is
important,
we
believe,
for
this
reason.
the
petitioner
has
squarely
joined
issue
with
respondent
on
this
question.
petitioner
realizes
that
the
texas
supreme
court
has
reversed
and
remanded
this
course
to
be
divided
without
discrimination,
divided
on
a
rational
basis.
petitioner
brought
the
case
here
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
believe
there's
a
big
difference,
reasonable
difference.
when
this
court
says
that
the
question,
as
we
understand
the
court
in
dusch
to
sailors,
the
question
is
not
one
man,
one
vote,
the
question
is
whether
there
is
invidious
discrimination.
let
me
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
believe
so
as
i
understand
your
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
am
speaking
only
for
midland
county
as
it
gets
three
or
three
county
commissioners,
if
you
please,
and
midland
county,
not
for
the
other
texas
counties.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
think
that's
exactly
what
it
means,
your
honor.
your
honor
please,
i
did
not
want
to
equivocate
in
answering
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
there's
only
one
question
before
this
court.
if
your
honor,
i
believe
you
phrased
it
in
prior
argument,
the
only
ruling
made
by
the
texas
supreme
court
which
is
the
law
of
this
case.
and
if
that
be
a
final
judgment,
then
so
it
be.
and
that
is
the
one
question
for
decision
here
and
we
believe
the
only
question.
the
one
holding
that's
the
law
of
this
case.
we
disagree
with
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
in
its
requirement
that
midland
county
be
redistricted
into
commissioners
precincts
solely
upon
the
basis
on
population.
that
is
what
i've
tried
to
get
over.
that's
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
that
is
the
issue.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
your
honor,
let
me
first
say
as
i've
tried
to
say
before
as
i
understood
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
think
the
first
question
that
must
be
decided,
will
this
court
say,
the
texas
courts
will
not
follow
the
law?
the
texas
trial
court
or
commissioners
court
and
the
district
court
will
not
follow
the
texas
supreme
court.
the
trial
court
will
permit
discrimination.
the
texas
appellate
courts
will
permit
discrimination.
is
this
court
going
to
say
that
first,
because
you
have
before
you
now,
not
an
appeal
from
any
final
judgment?
you
do
have
before
you
an
appeal
from
a
texas
supreme
court
which
we
must
admit.
thus,
make
the
law
of
this
particular
case.
so
that
if
the
court
wishes
to
step
into
this
case
at
this
time,
which
apparently
it
does
having
granted
the
petition.
then
the
question
arises,
are
we
to
hold
that
in
every
substate
government
in
texas,
every
one
of
the
counties
in
texas
there
must
be
a
division
solely
on
equal
population?
your
honor,
this
in
texas
in
west
texas,
we
were
in
the
middle
of
west
texas.
we
have
county
after
county.
we
have
counties
larger
than
any
state.
we
have
counties
brewster
county
with
alpine
as
its
county
seat.
the
big
bend
country
with
their
presidio,
the
county
seat,
one
town
in
a
county
with
thousands
of
miles
of
ranches
and
farms.
are
we
going
to
say
that
every
one
of
these
counties
must
be
divided
with
precincts
centering
in
the
town,
centering
in
the
city
because
you
cannot
otherwise
divide
these
counties?
midland
county
cannot
be
divided
into
four
precincts
of
equal
population
unless
you
put
the
center
of
that
division
in
the
city
of
midland
and
let
the
city,
and
let
everyone
of
the
commissioners.
that
is
what
the
texas
supreme
court
was
talking
about,
we
believe.
your
honor
please,
let
me
for
just
a
few
remarks
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
if
you
permitted
precincts
to
some
extent,
yes.
but
this
is
safeguard
against
that
and
that
hasn't
been
called
at
this
court's
attention.
mr.
chief
justice,
you
asked
the
question
here
earlier,
who
levies
the
taxes
for
the
county's
business?
you
we're
told
that
the
commissioners
court
had
the
authority.
that
is
true.
you
asked,
who
are
handles
these
salaries
finally?
i
know
in
the
particular
at
work,
this
is
a
commissioners
court
and
a
system
of
government
of
courts,
of
judicial
bodies.
anything
the
commissioners
court
thus
is
subject
to
supervision
and
control
of
the
district
court.
may
i
elaborate
upon
that
for
just
a
minute?
in
texas,
we
have
the
texas
supreme
court
and
equal
with
it,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
the
texas
supreme
court
under
it,
our
courts
of
civil
appeals,
16
or
18
of
them.
under
that,
we
have
the
district
court
such
as
a
trial
court
or
the
circuit
court
in
so
many
states.
but
under
article
v,
section
8
of
the
texas
constitution,
the
district
court
is
given
supervision
and
control
over
the
commissioners
court.
the
same
article
of
our
constitution
sets
up
the
commissioners
court
which
has
many
judicial
functions,
many
judicial
functions.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
yes,
sir.
if
it
is
discriminatory.
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
or
that
they
have
penalized
some
and
favored
others,
anything
where
discrimination
is
shown.
your
honor
please,
you
we're
told
that
the
commissioners
court
has
legislative
functions,
the
fixing
of
taxes.
this
court
we
thought
fast
on
that
in
the
sailors
suit.
that
just
a
mere
--
that
was
a
boarder,
the
school
board,
the
mere
ability
to
tax
is
not
strictly
legislative,
i
thought
we
read
that.
but
here
we
would
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
believe
they
did
in
part,
yes
sir.
but
the
court
said
this
day
that
this
is
not
a
legislative
board,
if
that
makes
the
difference.
we
believe
it
does.
let
me
go
to
one
other
point.
you
were
told
that
this
court
had
legislative
functions
because
it
divided
the
county
or
could
divide
the
county
into
four
precincts.
to
me
this
is
a
judicial
function.
no
better
proofs
of
the
control
of
the
people
have
than
this
very
redistricting
or
districting
of
the
county.
this
county
was
redistricted
and
a
direct
appeal
to
the
district
court,
the
district
judge
elected
by
the
people
throughout
the
county.
these
are
set
up
in
texas
is
for
all
the
people
of
the
county.
the
city
runs
nine-tenths
of
the
election
votes
now.
under
the
texas
law,
you
have
as
the
arm
of
the
state
the
county
and
its
officers.
you
have
the
district
judge,
elected
countywide.
he
has
the
supervision
of
this
commissioners
court.
you
have
the
county
judge,
elected
countywide.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
the
county
judge?
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
he
cannot
if
this
it's
two
and
two.
however,
he
can
exercise
influence,
the
chief
judge
of
the
court
bringing
up
matters
or
not
bringing
them
up
and
having
them
where
he
does
see
fit.
but
more
important,
your
honor,
in
a
county
where
you
have
a
city
such
as
midland,
where
there
are
60,000
people,
50,000,
40,000
votes.
there
is
a
great
weight
on
any
of
these
commissioners.
by
the
varying
numbers
of
the
city
voters,
if
you
please,
by
the
county
judge,
the
county
sheriff,
elected
countywide.
you
talk
about
the
commissioners
court
having
authority.
you
see
what
we
get
into
when
we
argue
about
the
commissioners
court
of
texas.
you
have
the
gentleman
here
in
and
utmost
good
faith
arguing
texas
statutes.
and
then
you
have
us
for
the
respondents
arguing
texas
statutes.
we
submit
that
the
texas
statutes
have
been
construed
by
the
texas
supreme
court.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
four
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
at
the
present
time,
about
95%
of
the
voters
in
the
city
of
midland
precinct
1,
about
5%
or
6%
in
the
other
three
precincts,
about
2%
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
your
honor
please,
we've
already
allot
--
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
we
have
lost
that
war.
the
texas
supreme
court
has
held
against
us
in
that
point.
we
do
not
have
that
--
sir?
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
it
is
since
1963
and
this
matter
went
to
the
court.
the
texas
supreme
court
entered
its
order,
it
was
brought
here.
we
have
not
recommended
or
i
will
say
the
commissioners
court
has
not
change,
i
don't
know
what
to
do
yet
until
this
case
is
decided
here.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
because
the
texas
court
will
not
permit
under
its
present
decision.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
we
can't
do
anything
else,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
under
the
supreme
court
of
texas
opinion,
we
thought
we
knew
what
we
had
to
do
or
rather
what
the
commissioners
court
had
to
do.
when
it
comes
near,
if
you
hold
that
the
county
must
be
divided
solely
on
equal
population
basis,
it
will
be
so
divided.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
think
that
we
are
supposed
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
then
to
the
commissioners
court.
i
was
to
be
clear
about
that.
i
think
that
texas
supreme
court
had
to
send
it
back
to
the
commissioners
court
just
as
this
court
would
send
to
a
federal
district
court.
i
don't
know
that
you
might
go
through
a
court
of
appeals.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
now,
when
you
get
to
the
commissioners
court,
those
four
gentlemen
are
going
to
have
to
follow
the
law
as
made
by
this
opinion.
and
they
are
going
to
be
advised
that
this
is
the
law.
we
are
all
lawyers.
we
are
all
houses
of
the
court.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
now,
then
these
commissioners
whether
they
divide
solely
on
a
population
basis
or
take
into
consideration
roads,
the
amounts
of
roads
and
things
like
that,
of
course,
is
up
to
them.
and
i
cannot
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
it
is
up
to
them
what
division
they
make
based
on
population
and
in
consideration
to
other
factors.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
no,
they
did
not.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
you
must
consider
population
and
equality
of
population.
you
may
consider
as
making
a
variance
of
equal
population,
this
matter
of
roads,
taxable
value,
and
preserving
the
voice
of
the
rural
people.
now,
i
don't
want
to
digest
the
issue
either.
we
believe
that
the
voice
of
the
rural
people
must
be
preserved
to
some
extent.
i
do
not
take
the
solicitor
general's
brief
to
be
at
the
contrary.
now,
the
petitioner
is,
petitioner
takes
the
position
as
i
understand
it
that
in
every
county,
there
must
be
division
solely
on
equality
of
population.
we
believe
that
as
was
shown
in
hearing,
this
commissioners
court
had
hearings,
town
hall
meetings
practically
for
about
six
days.
they
heard
different
recommendations.
one
of
them
was,
“well,
in
this
county
let's
have
two
precincts
in
the
city
and
two
in
the
county.”
maybe
they
would
do
that.
i
don't
know
what
this
commissioners
court
would
do.
there
was
one
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
yes,
sir,
they
could.
they
might
take
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
they
would
have
to
bring
the
two
country
in
their
apartment.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
not
very
good.
now,
the
other
plan
was
and
the
one
that
might
well
be
considered
fair
by
the
texas
court
is
three
commissioners
precincts
in
the
city
and
one
in
the
country,
which
is
solicitor
general
even
suggested.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
four
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
--
three
--
four
constitutionally
under
the
texas
constitution.
answering
your
honor's
question,
i
cannot
presume
to
say
what
this
court,
this
lower
court
would
do.
i
would
not
attempt
to
do
but
i
say
this,
if
there
is
discrimination,
these
petitioners
have
their
remedy
in
the
texas
court
unless
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
do
not
want
to.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
mr.
pannill
wishes
to
argue
that
it
does
not
apply.
and
if
you
will
permit
it,
we
will
argue
that
it
does
not
apply.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
your
honor,
we
believe
that
we
can
argue
that
reynolds
versus
sims
and
baker
versus
carr
should
not
be
applied
to
substate
governments.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
we
do
want
to
argue
that.
mr.
pannill
will
argue
it.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
the
texas
supreme
court
says
that
under
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
texas
and
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
there
has
been
discrimination
here.
under
the
two
constitutions,
we
do
not
believe
the
state
is
required
or
that
the
state
law
requires
that
the
county
commissioners
be
divided
into
four
precincts
in
every
case
solely
on
population.
we
say
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
think
it
is
not
inconsistent.
it
might
be
a
better
phrase.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
it.
my
argument
that
i
have
tried
to
present
–-
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
insofar
as
it
would
apply
one
man,
one
vote,
i
would
have
to
say,
no.
insofar
as
it
requires
no
invidious
discrimination,
i
would
say,
yes.
i'm
not
trying
to
equivocate
with
your
honor.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
think
the
texas
supreme
court
has
said
that.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
think
that
the
texas
supreme
court
has
said
that
and
that
that
would
be
a
big
factor
in
determining
whether
it
had
been
in
indiscrimination.
i
think
that
is
a
fair
amount
factor
in
determining
the
texas
constitution
uses
the
words
“for
the
convenience
of
the
people”.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
and
we
also
have
a
clause
in
our
constitution
about
republican
form
of
government.
i
think
it
would
violate
these,
if
it
does
violence
to
the
--
with
no
consideration
to
population.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
personally
think
it
must.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
don't
know.
i
think
the
court
meant
you
will
consider
population
as
what
it
says.
you
may
vary
from
population
if
you
have
good
grounds
and
reason
to
do
so.
so
i
think
that
meant
you
must
give
--
i
think
the
word
predominant
would
be
correct.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
i
would
not.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
right.
your
honor,
as
i
say,
the
second
part
of
our
argument
which
we
thought
proper
to
get
first,
because
we
did
pick
it
up
from
the
latter
opinions.
we
say
only
assumption,
the
reynolds
versus
sims
control.
then
the
constitutional
test
is
whether
there's
invidious
discrimination
and
under
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court,
petitioner
has
failed
to
show
discrimination
unless,
your
honors
please,
unless
this
court
is
to
now
hold
that
in
every
case,
the
commissioners
courts
of
texas
must
be
divided
solely
on
a
population
basis.
may
i
say
this;
i
was
really
very
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
mean
that
was
a
large
part
of
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
i
meant
that
he
has
failed
to
show
discrimination
and
that
this
case
is
ordered
back
to
the
trial
court
to
divide
without
discrimination.
that's
where
it
is
but,
i
added
this.
and
we
must
admit
this
opinion
by
the
texas
supreme
court
will
be
the
law
of
the
case
in
the
trial
court.
so
the
law
of
the
case
as
made
by
the
texas
supreme
court
is
you
will
consider
this
population.
you
will
consider
the
states
--
the
united
states
constitution.
but
you
do
not
have
to
be
confined
to
this
straitjacket
of
dividing
solely
on
equal
population.
now,
petitioner
says
that
has
discrimination.
petitioner
must
take
the
position
that
is
itself
invidious
discrimination
unless
you
will
give
division
on
equal
population
alone,
as
a
matter
of
law
you
have
invidious
discrimination.
now,
this
is
not
the
issue
as
i
understand
it
--
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
yes
sir,
we
do.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
mr.
pannill,
i
ask
you
to
do
that
now.
mr.
w.
b.
browder,
jr.
may
he
argue
on
that,
your
honor.
