mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
members
of
the
court.
i
think
that
before
forgetting
in
a
detail
here,
might
better
to
set
the
treaty
in
this
proper
context
which
is
that
they
did
not
change
the
basic
law
which
was
fought
on
the
part
of
the
airline.
nor
did
it
change
that
basic
law
under
civil
law
presumed
liability
on
the
part
of
the
airline
where
the
airline
already
had
the
burden
of
proof.
and
as
far
as
american
law
is
concerned
didn't
change
that
because
basically
common
carrier
has
the
burden
of
proof
of
freedom,
freedom
from
ever
since
–-
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
now
sir?
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
i
think
in
1929
there
were
about
20
to
25
signatories.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
they
were.
and
against
this
background
sir,
we
look
at
this
and
see
what
this
treaty
really
gave.
and
what
it
did
was
impose
a
limitation
of
liability
in
exchange
for
an
elusory
presumption
of
liability,
the
carrier
updating
$300.00.
and
did
give
anything
else
but
imposing
this
limitation
which
benefited
only
the
carrier,
because
there's
nothing
in
the
treaty
that
benefits
of
passenger
and
i
say
that
advisably.
they
--
there
was
one
quid
pro
quo
as
the
court
below
found
and
that
is
you
must
deliver
a
ticket
to
the
passenger
that
has
certain
basic
information.
and
actually
this
treaty
also
is
not
self-executing,
it
doesn't
automatically
impose
itself.
it's
faced
on
upon
a
contract
between
the
passenger
and
the
carrier,
which
contract
must
say
certain
things
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
treaty
applies
where
the
two
countries
parties
to
the
treaty.
you
have
to
look
at
the
contract,
you
have
to
--
in
order
to
determine
what
the
carrier
is
you
have
to
look
at
the
contract,
in
order
to
detemine
where
if
there's
an
accident
to
bring
the
action.
a
matter
of
fact
that
was
another
right
they
took
away
from
the
passenger.
ordinarily,
as
well
established,
if
you
have
an
accident
its
transitory
and
you
bring
an
action
wherever
you
find
them
and
they
eliminated
that
right
or
they
eliminated
very
much.
now,
the
contractual
nature
of
the
treaty
makes
it
conditional
that
is
there
must
be
a
contract
and
it
is
a
condition
precedent
which
must
be
fulfilled
by
the
carrier
before
he
can
invoke
this
unusual
limitation
of
liability
for
fault.
and
as
the
court
below
found,
they
didn't
fulfill
this
condition.
they
didn't
deliver
what
was
plainly
stated
in
article
iii
they
didn't
deliver
a
ticket.
and
as
this
court
note
previously
you
cant
just
give
a
boarding
pass
with
the
number
of
the
flight,
flight
29
to
a
passenger
and
tell
him
that
that
its
transportation
between
two
countries
of
the
parties
to
the
convention
or
tell
him
where
to
bring
the
action
anything
happens
or
tell
him
anything
or
tell
him
that
he
has
a
right
as
under
article
22
(1)
to
negotiate
for
a
higher
limit.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
i
think
the
ticket
is
sir,
which
is
a
contract.
a
ticket
is
the
name
of
the
airline
which
is
one
party
to
the
contract,
is
the
name
of
the
passenger
which
is
the
other
part
of
the
contract.
it
gives
the
place
of
origin.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
now,
i
don't
want
to
be
put
in
a
position
sir,
and
i
think
you're
quite
very
pertinent
of
saying
that
we
must
have
all
of
these
items
all
the
time
because
if
at
times
out
of
a
particular
situation,
that
a
particular
item
that's
omitted
is
a
material
to
that
situation.for
example,
if
at
least
at
intermediate
stopping
places
and
you
know
it
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
if
it
leaves
out
something
that's
a
material
that
turns
out
to
be
a
material,
only
to
turns
up
to
be
a
material.
but
–-
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well
not
quite
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
no,
sir.
for
this,
when
i
say
it
turns
out
to
be
a
material
there
are
five
items
that
are
listed
as
in
the
requirements
of
the
ticket.
now,
all
of
those
may
not
be
material
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
to
a
particularly
situation
to
determine
whether
the
carrier
has
given
a
proper
ticket
to
the
passenger.
for
example,
the
ticket
is
issued
from
country
a
to
country
b,
or
county
a
to
county
b
and
then
back
to
country
a.
now
country
b
is
not
a
party
to
warsaw
convention
but
country
a
is.
so
there
the
stopping
place
--
intermediate
stopping
place
would
be
material
because
the
convention
says
that
if
there
is
a
stop
in
the
third
country
which
is
not
a
party
of
the
convention
then
the
convention
applies,
otherwise
if
does
not.
so
otherwise
it's
domestic
transportation
because
there's
no
intermediate
stop
at
the
third
country.
so
therefore
in
that
case,
stopping
place
would
be
material
but
however
if
you
have,
let's
say
a
trip
in
new
york
to
mexico
city
and
there
intermediate
stops
in
the
flight
let's
say
washington-nashville
and
so
on.
they
live
out
the
intermediate
stopping
place
washington-nashville,
but
if
the
passenger
is
going
new
york
to
mexico
city,
well,
the
fact
that
they
left
out
those
stopping
place
a
material
because
you
got
new
york-mexico
city
that
determines
the
warsaw
nature
of
the
transportation.
that's
what
i
mean
by
whether
it's
material
or
not.
now,
of
course
in
the
case
of
limitation
of
liability
that
is
subject
to
the
warsaw
convention
that's
always
material
because
he
has
to
know
what
is
contract
is
that
is
subject
to
the
warsaw
convention.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
thank
you.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
thank
you
sir.
i
should
like
to
make
one
correction
primarily
if
i
may.
in
answer
to
the
question
as
to
the
type
of
countries
involved
in
the
original
delegation.
i
think,
i
said
yes
to
the
united
states.
united
states
was
not
a
signer
the
original
convention
in
1929
sir.
it
merely
had
an
unofficial
observer
present.
it
did
not
have
a
delegate
and
it
did
not
adhere
to
the
convention
until
1934.
the
common
law
countries
involved,
they're
a
part
from
the
civil
code
companies
were
just
british
empire
countries.
now,
it
is
--
i
believe
well
worth
pointing
out
to
the
court
that
the
defendant
alitalia
really
recognized
the
necessity
of
delivery
of
a
ticket
which
is
a
contract
ticket
to
the
passenger.
when
in
its
completing
affirm
that
defenses
to
this
action
it
said
that
alitalia
alleged
that
the
transportation
was
being
performed
pursuant
to
contract
made
with
each
of
the
plaintiffs.
there
was
one
affirmative
defense
and
that
the
transportation
was
government
by
a
contract
of
transportation,
another
affirming
defense.
and
another
affirmative
defense
that
it
dully
complied
with
the
conditions
of
the
warsaw
convention.
and
another
affirmative
defense
that
it
has
not
entered
into
a
special
contract
for
raising
the
limit
of
liability.
and
all
of
these
are
placid
admissions
and
it's
like
labor
in
common
sense
when
the
--
as
the
courts
somewhat
observed
before.
the
article
iii
says
the
ticket
must
be
delivered
and
immediately
before
that
describes
what
must
go
into
the
ticket.
they're
not
talking
about
a
blank
piece
of
paper
and
that
exactly
what
alitalia
says
that
all
they
had
to
do
is
deliver
a
blank
piece
of
paper
which
gives
the
flight
number,
even
not
even
that.
now
–-
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
no
sir,
nothing
at
all
sir
except
that
the
fact
that
it
felt
it
necessary
to
allege
those
defenses
i
think
it's
significant.
a
matter
of
fact,
you
might
go
in
one
step
further
and
say
here
they
did
make
up
a
ticket
which
they
have
been
using
for
years
and
getting
away
with.
and
this
ticket
with
this
mass
of
microscopic
print,
although
finally
they
were
called
on
it
and
the
ticket
was
ruled
by
a
number
courts.
it
has
all
been
ruled
by
a
number
of
courts
in
this
country
as
inadequate
and
not
complying
with
the
convention.
now,
much
is
being
made
of
the
difference
between
article
iii
and
article
iv
and
viii
to
drafting
difference.
and
i
respectfully
submit
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
it's
78
(a)
sir
of
the
record.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
57
(a)
is
another
reproduction
of
the
same
thing
that
was
made
by
the
defendant
to
support
of
its
affidavit
and
78
(a)
was
a
reproduction
made
in
the
official
opinion
of
judge
mcmahon
that
who
originally
ruled
upon
commotion.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
there's
an
attempt
to
include
them
that
gets
me
to
another
point.
when
i
say
attempt
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
but
may
i
qualify
that
answer,
and
i
meant
in
this
sense
sir
that
there's
another
point
in
my
brief
which
is
that
even
if
you
could
read
these
conditions,
that
they
are
unintelligible
and
that
it
is
it
says
that
the
warsaw
convention
may
apply.
if
it
involves
unnamed
countries
and
may
--
in
other
words
it
may
apply
as
it
applies
and
which
is
an
unequivocal,
qualified
conditional
statement
and
it
doesn't
tell
the
passenger
that
is
actually
traveling
subject
to
the
warsaw
convention.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
clear
statement
of
that
anyway
even
if
you
could
read
it.
and
by
that
sir
that
is
why
i
hesitated
to
reply
to
your
question.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
that's
correct
sir.
that's
right
it
can
not
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
78
(a),
yes
sir.
and
it
was
a
found
unreadable
by
the
district
judge,
it
was
found
unreadable
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well
they
looked
at
it.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
i
guess
your
honor
they
go
by
what
the
average,
the
average
person
sees
when
he
looks
at
it
and
i
guess
some
of
us
are
blessed
with
keener
eyesight
than
others.
they
found
that
it
was
so
microscopic
and
such
a
mass
of
what
would
appear
a
print
that
it
could
not
be
read.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
80
(a)
is
one
of
the
ticket
coupons
sir,
and
it's
at
78
(a)
would
be
on
the
back.
yes.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes,
there's
a
reference
there
at
sir,
on
80
(a),
right
at
the
bottom
of
the
coupon.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well
no,
there
was
just
a
reference,
a
reference
on
the
face
of
coupon
the
italian
language.but
the
conditions
were
in
english.
the
--
this
being
an
italian
carrier,
there
may
have
been
another
page
of
conditions
that
was
in
italian.
but
my
point
was
that
the,
with
respect
to
the
como
passenger,
this
is
the
plaintiff,
the
ticket
have
been
issued
in
tunisia,
where
the
official
language
is
arabic
that
should've
been
in
arabic.
for
example,
if
you
have
a
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
and
because
you
don't
have
actual
notice,
you
have
imputed
notice.
and
therefore
if
have
imputed
notice
it
should
be
in
the
notice
of
the
language
of
the
country
where
the
contract
is
made.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well
then,
then
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
unfortunate,
if
you
bought
the
ticket
for
example
because
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
it
wouldn't
make
a
difference
to
you.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
wouldn't
make
any
difference
to
you
except
that
the
operation
law
it
would
work
against
you.
for
example,
suppose
you're
an
american
passenger,
american,
you
bought
a
ticket
in
tokyo
to
the
united
states
and
naturally
the
ticket
–
you
buy
it
on
japanese
airlines,
the
ticket
would
be
printed
on
japanese.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
that's
correct
sir,
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir,
that's
right.
but
if
the
issue
--
if
you're
issued
in
tunisia
where
the
official
language
is
arabic,
i
say
it
has
to
be
issued
in
arabic.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes.
but
that
would
depend
if
you
could
show
actual
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
passenger
could
read
english.
for
example,
supposed
you
bought
a
ticket
in
japan
and
the
ticket
was
printed
in
japanese.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
it
would
it
could
be
any
language
the
carrier
chose,
they
may
--
would
they
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
it
could
be
italian
and
japanese,
that's
right
and
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes,
but
it
would
still
be
binding
on
you
to
be
printed
japanese
you
bought
in
japan
would
be
binding
on
you
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
oh
yes,
i
don't
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
there's
any
inference
on
the
part
of
the
appellant
that
the
claim
of
actual
notice,
of
course
not.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
that
only
applies
to
the
–
this
is
the
funny
passenger
sir.
because
this
--
that's
only
claim
as
to
that
and
this.
they
were
one
of
this
groups
that
originated
in
tunisia,
that's
just
a
special
situation.but
as
far
as
the
others
are
concerned
there's
no
such
issue
raised
sir.
you
know,
if
it
was
in
english
and
italian
and
if
the
language
--
if
the
language
is
no
problem
there.
they're
only
talking
about
the
imputed
knowledge.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
at
the
hague
conference?
that
was
in
1955
sir.
well,
in
the
hague
conference
there
was
a
discussion
of
amending
article
iii
to
add
a
specific
provision
that
is
subject
to
the
warsaw
convention
as
the
mandatory
item.
and
that
did
not
change
anything,
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief
because
it
was
already
there.
it
merely
helped
to
clarify
it
because
of
a
fact
that
–-
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
all
the
sanction
was
already
there
sir
but
it
merely
was
an
amended
–
an
approval
in
the
language.
and
actually
the
real
purpose
it
was,
when
they
say
it
shall
be
prima
facie
evidence
of
the
contract
the
ticket
shall
be
prima
facie
evidence
of
contract,
the
real
purpose
it
was,
was
to
prevent
the
passenger
for
what
any
time
raising
any
issue
in
the
future
as
to
the
adequacy
of
the
ticket.
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
hague
protocol
as
to
article
iii.
as
a
matter
of
fact
another
of
the
hague
protocol
which
i
might
say
generally
was
to
plug
loopholes
real
or
fancy
in
the
warsaw
convention.
and
they
changed
article
25
or
willful
misconduct
to
make
it
stronger,
so
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
prove
willful
misconduct
short
of
murder
or
attempted
murder.
and
they
also
eliminated
this
possibility
of
an
action
against
the
pilot
separately.
so,
they
were
already
plugging
loopholes.
they
weren't
really
changing
anything
basically.
and
the
united
states
and
as
a
sub
to
that,
they
added
$88,000.00.
and
the
united
states
of
course
did
not
adhere
to
work
for
the
various
reasons
that
i
have
guessed
given.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
they
got
on
--
all
except
the
discofanny
family.
there
were
five
families
on
here
sir,
they
got
on
a
plane
at
rome.
and
that
--
and
i'd
like
to
make
clear
there
is
no
question
as
to
all
of
these
families
as
to
the
language
used.
they
--
the
ticket
was
in
italian
or
english.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
the
language
--
the
language
of
the
ticket
was
in
both
italian
and
english
so
there's
no
question
to
that.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well
the
–-
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
it's
illegible.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
that's
correct
sir.
that's
right
and
it's
the
--
and
also
as
to
the
language
of
the
provision.
i'm
talking
about
language
and
i'm
talking
about
words
that
it
is
not
clearly
stated
that
the
transportation
is
subject
to
the
warsaw
convention
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir,
that's
right
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well
the
--
this
crash
have
taken
place
in
ireland
sir,
the
law
of
ireland
would
govern
it.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
no
sir
because
the
crash
took
place
there.
yes
sir.
except
that
as
your
honors
familiar
where
the
change
in
the
choice
of
law
theory,
for
example,
if
you
bought
a
roundtrip,
new
york
to
rome
and
new
york
that
it
might
be
held
under
the
modern
choice
of
law
theory
that
the
--
even
though
the
accident
took
place
in
ireland
that
the
law
of
new
york
applies.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
yes,
the
law
of
ireland
follows
the
fatal
accidents
act
of
england
and
it's
the
same
ordinary
in
negligence
with
the
unlimited
damages
that
is
damages
that
you
can
prove.
and
it's
basically
the
same
as
the
law
of
the
united
states.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
no
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir,
there
was
a
montreal
agreement.
the
united
states
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
in
'66,
the
united
states
is
about
to
denounce
the
warsaw
convention
all
together
withdraw
and
had
served
notice
under
provisions
of
the
warsaw
convention
that
it
was
withdrawing.
and
there
was
a
lot
behind-the-scenes
negotiation
going
on
and
on
the
very
last
day
when
the
air
carriers
agreed
to
fly
paris,
raising
the
limit
of
liability
to
$75,000.00,
the
united
states
withdrew
its
denunciation.
and
that
incidentally
those
atones
that's
not
an
amendment
of
the
treaty.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
no
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
no.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well
that
was
on
the
civil
aeronautics
board,
a
regulation
sir.
and
that
came
about
in
this
fashion.
the
civil
aeronautics
board,
from
time
to
time
is
asked
to
--
because
of
the
antitrust
laws
involved
is
asked
to
approve
resolutions
between
various
international
carriers
where
the
--
whereby
the
fixed
rates
and
certain
practices.
and
this
resolutions
have
to
be
approved
under
the
civil
aeronautics
act
otherwise
they
run
into
the
antitrust
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
and
that's
how
it
came
up,
but
there
was
no
expressed
approval
of
the
ticket.
as
such
in
any
time
by
the
civil
aeronautics
board,
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
they
indicated
that
they
disapproved
of
it
in
the
form
it
is
now.
and
that
the
civil
aeronautics
board
has
filed
a
brief
amicus
in
this
court.
and
which
would
explain
exactly
what
it
did
and
as
to
the
united
states
showing
that
the
policy
of
the
united
states
was
that
notice
that
this
ticket
was
inadequate
a
notice
should
be
required,
it
was
filed
by
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
that
was
inadequate
because
of
the
--
its
readability
because
of
the
plaintiff.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
i
would
say
sir
of
a
number
of
grounds
that
was
a
culmination
of
many
years
of
discussion
in
this
country,
because
at
the
time
the
warsaw
convention
was
adhered
by
this
country,
there
was
no
public
discussion
at
all
in
the
senate
and
it
was
a
time
when
nobody
pay
any
attention
to,
what
much
interested
in
international
air
transportation
and
it
just
quietly
happened.
and
then
since
international
transportation
impinged
more
to
the
public
consciousness,
everyone's
traveling
then
warsaw
suddenly
became
noticeable.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
no
sir.
most
of
them
were
residence
of
new
york.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
and
as
for
the
discofanny
family
they
were
immigrating
to
new
york
so
for
all
practical
purpose,
they're
going
to
be
residents
and
they
still
are
residents
of
new
york
that
is
the
survivor.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well
–-
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well
–-
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
he
could've
gone
by
steamer
for
one.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
he
could've
gone
by
steam
ship
number
one
which
many
consider
whether
just
to
be
or
not
i
won't
say,
a
more
reliable
form
of
transportation
involving
less
risks.
he
could've
gotten
more
insurance
for
another
or
he
could've
gotten
insurance,
and
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
if
he
knew
--
if
he
knew
that
his
recovery
would
be
limited
he'd
have
to
know
that
first
sir,
but
he
didn't
know
that.
and
the
only
way
he
could
know
that
was
to
have
a
warning
given
to
him
with
the
ticket.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
no
sir.
my
argument
hinges
upon
two
things.
that
the
--
it
is
not
readable
and
even
if
readable
it
does
not
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
dimension
because
it
does
not
fulfill
all
the
conditions
including
proper
notice.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
it
has
the
name
of
the
carrier,
may
not
have
the
address
but
i
don't
think
that's
particularly
material
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
e,
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
i
think
that
that
statement
has
to
be
clearer
and
unequivocal
and
i
think
it
has
the
state
that
the
--
and
very
clear
prominent
way
that
there
is
a
limitation
of
liability.
and
that
the
amount
of
recovery
will
be
limited.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
there
are
two
things
that
its
here.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
you
see,
if
you
can
read
it,
number
one,
an
number
two
it
has
to
be
intelligible,
it
has
to
tell
the
passenger
what
it
supposed
to
tell
him
and
it
doesn't
do
it.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
that's
it
warsaw
convention
maybe,
but
you
see
there
isn't
any
clear
and
definite
statement
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
right
it
does,
that's
correct
sir.
it
doesn't
say
that
this
is
transportation
subject
to
the
warsaw
convention.
there
isn't
any
clear
equivocal
statement
and
that
the
--
and
doesn't
say
this
transportation
is
subject
limited
liability.
it
doesn't
say
that.
in
other
words
the
passenger
does
not
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
i
would
say
--
it
doesn't
say
that
sir
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
i
don't
think
that's
enough,
i
think
it
has
adhering
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
i
would
say
that
it
should
say
that
if
you're
killed
or
injured
that
there's
a
limitation
of
liability
on
the
amount
you
can
recover
in
the
sum
of
$82,090.00.
and
that
the
point
is
that
the
--
they
don't
even
say
it's
subject
to
which
is
the
--
and
it's
been
held,
there's
some
english
cases
that
i
cite
which
hold
that
that
is
deficient.
now,
the
convention
itself
would
have
no
purpose
in
opposing
this
one
sided
advantage
that
it
would
be
--
would
make
any
sense
unless
the
passenger
got
notice
of
what
was
involved.
because
otherwise
this
would
be
a
legislation
of
the
most
repugnant
kind
which
you
took
away
fundamental
rights
and
we
are
faced
with
this
extreme
position.
now,
the
difference
in
drafting
between
article
iii
and
article
iv
is
my
opinion
easily
explain
because
article
iv
we
have
unaccompanied
baggage,
article
viii
unaccompanied
goods.
you
have
to
make
certain
things
mandatory
because
otherwise
it
couldn't
identify
the
goods
or
couldn't
identify
the
baggage.
and
so
that
if
there's
anybody
going
to
be
penalized,
they
decided
to
be
the
carrier
rather
than
the
shipper
or
the
passenger
for
failure
to
state
these
very
fundamental
things,
so
there's
a
definite
difference.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
thank
you
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
members
of
the
court.
i
think
that
before
forgetting
in
a
detail
here,
might
better
to
set
the
treaty
in
this
proper
context
which
is
that
they
did
not
change
the
basic
law
which
was
fought
on
the
part
of
the
airline.
nor
did
it
change
that
basic
law
under
civil
law
presumed
liability
on
the
part
of
the
airline
where
the
airline
already
had
the
burden
of
proof.
and
as
far
as
american
law
is
concerned
didn't
change
that
because
basically
common
carrier
has
the
burden
of
proof
of
freedom,
freedom
from
ever
since
–-
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
now
sir?
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
i
think
in
1929
there
were
about
20
to
25
signatories.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
they
were.
and
against
this
background
sir,
we
look
at
this
and
see
what
this
treaty
really
gave.
and
what
it
did
was
impose
a
limitation
of
liability
in
exchange
for
an
elusory
presumption
of
liability,
the
carrier
updating
$300.00.
and
did
give
anything
else
but
imposing
this
limitation
which
benefited
only
the
carrier,
because
there's
nothing
in
the
treaty
that
benefits
of
passenger
and
i
say
that
advisably.
they
--
there
was
one
quid
pro
quo
as
the
court
below
found
and
that
is
you
must
deliver
a
ticket
to
the
passenger
that
has
certain
basic
information.
and
actually
this
treaty
also
is
not
self-executing,
it
doesn't
automatically
impose
itself.
it's
faced
on
upon
a
contract
between
the
passenger
and
the
carrier,
which
contract
must
say
certain
things
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
treaty
applies
where
the
two
countries
parties
to
the
treaty.
you
have
to
look
at
the
contract,
you
have
to
--
in
order
to
determine
what
the
carrier
is
you
have
to
look
at
the
contract,
in
order
to
detemine
where
if
there's
an
accident
to
bring
the
action.
a
matter
of
fact
that
was
another
right
they
took
away
from
the
passenger.
ordinarily,
as
well
established,
if
you
have
an
accident
its
transitory
and
you
bring
an
action
wherever
you
find
them
and
they
eliminated
that
right
or
they
eliminated
very
much.
now,
the
contractual
nature
of
the
treaty
makes
it
conditional
that
is
there
must
be
a
contract
and
it
is
a
condition
precedent
which
must
be
fulfilled
by
the
carrier
before
he
can
invoke
this
unusual
limitation
of
liability
for
fault.
and
as
the
court
below
found,
they
didn't
fulfill
this
condition.
they
didn't
deliver
what
was
plainly
stated
in
article
iii
they
didn't
deliver
a
ticket.
and
as
this
court
note
previously
you
cant
just
give
a
boarding
pass
with
the
number
of
the
flight,
flight
29
to
a
passenger
and
tell
him
that
that
its
transportation
between
two
countries
of
the
parties
to
the
convention
or
tell
him
where
to
bring
the
action
anything
happens
or
tell
him
anything
or
tell
him
that
he
has
a
right
as
under
article
22
(1)
to
negotiate
for
a
higher
limit.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
i
think
the
ticket
is
sir,
which
is
a
contract.
a
ticket
is
the
name
of
the
airline
which
is
one
party
to
the
contract,
is
the
name
of
the
passenger
which
is
the
other
part
of
the
contract.
it
gives
the
place
of
origin.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
now,
i
don't
want
to
be
put
in
a
position
sir,
and
i
think
you're
quite
very
pertinent
of
saying
that
we
must
have
all
of
these
items
all
the
time
because
if
at
times
out
of
a
particular
situation,
that
a
particular
item
that's
omitted
is
a
material
to
that
situation.for
example,
if
at
least
at
intermediate
stopping
places
and
you
know
it
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
if
it
leaves
out
something
that's
a
material
that
turns
out
to
be
a
material,
only
to
turns
up
to
be
a
material.
but
–-
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well
not
quite
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
no,
sir.
for
this,
when
i
say
it
turns
out
to
be
a
material
there
are
five
items
that
are
listed
as
in
the
requirements
of
the
ticket.
now,
all
of
those
may
not
be
material
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
to
a
particularly
situation
to
determine
whether
the
carrier
has
given
a
proper
ticket
to
the
passenger.
for
example,
the
ticket
is
issued
from
country
a
to
country
b,
or
county
a
to
county
b
and
then
back
to
country
a.
now
country
b
is
not
a
party
to
warsaw
convention
but
country
a
is.
so
there
the
stopping
place
--
intermediate
stopping
place
would
be
material
because
the
convention
says
that
if
there
is
a
stop
in
the
third
country
which
is
not
a
party
of
the
convention
then
the
convention
applies,
otherwise
if
does
not.
so
otherwise
it's
domestic
transportation
because
there's
no
intermediate
stop
at
the
third
country.
so
therefore
in
that
case,
stopping
place
would
be
material
but
however
if
you
have,
let's
say
a
trip
in
new
york
to
mexico
city
and
there
intermediate
stops
in
the
flight
let's
say
washington-nashville
and
so
on.
they
live
out
the
intermediate
stopping
place
washington-nashville,
but
if
the
passenger
is
going
new
york
to
mexico
city,
well,
the
fact
that
they
left
out
those
stopping
place
a
material
because
you
got
new
york-mexico
city
that
determines
the
warsaw
nature
of
the
transportation.
that's
what
i
mean
by
whether
it's
material
or
not.
now,
of
course
in
the
case
of
limitation
of
liability
that
is
subject
to
the
warsaw
convention
that's
always
material
because
he
has
to
know
what
is
contract
is
that
is
subject
to
the
warsaw
convention.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
thank
you.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
thank
you
sir.
i
should
like
to
make
one
correction
primarily
if
i
may.
in
answer
to
the
question
as
to
the
type
of
countries
involved
in
the
original
delegation.
i
think,
i
said
yes
to
the
united
states.
united
states
was
not
a
signer
the
original
convention
in
1929
sir.
it
merely
had
an
unofficial
observer
present.
it
did
not
have
a
delegate
and
it
did
not
adhere
to
the
convention
until
1934.
the
common
law
countries
involved,
they're
a
part
from
the
civil
code
companies
were
just
british
empire
countries.
now,
it
is
--
i
believe
well
worth
pointing
out
to
the
court
that
the
defendant
alitalia
really
recognized
the
necessity
of
delivery
of
a
ticket
which
is
a
contract
ticket
to
the
passenger.
when
in
its
completing
affirm
that
defenses
to
this
action
it
said
that
alitalia
alleged
that
the
transportation
was
being
performed
pursuant
to
contract
made
with
each
of
the
plaintiffs.
there
was
one
affirmative
defense
and
that
the
transportation
was
government
by
a
contract
of
transportation,
another
affirming
defense.
and
another
affirmative
defense
that
it
dully
complied
with
the
conditions
of
the
warsaw
convention.
and
another
affirmative
defense
that
it
has
not
entered
into
a
special
contract
for
raising
the
limit
of
liability.
and
all
of
these
are
placid
admissions
and
it's
like
labor
in
common
sense
when
the
--
as
the
courts
somewhat
observed
before.
the
article
iii
says
the
ticket
must
be
delivered
and
immediately
before
that
describes
what
must
go
into
the
ticket.
they're
not
talking
about
a
blank
piece
of
paper
and
that
exactly
what
alitalia
says
that
all
they
had
to
do
is
deliver
a
blank
piece
of
paper
which
gives
the
flight
number,
even
not
even
that.
now
–-
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
no
sir,
nothing
at
all
sir
except
that
the
fact
that
it
felt
it
necessary
to
allege
those
defenses
i
think
it's
significant.
a
matter
of
fact,
you
might
go
in
one
step
further
and
say
here
they
did
make
up
a
ticket
which
they
have
been
using
for
years
and
getting
away
with.
and
this
ticket
with
this
mass
of
microscopic
print,
although
finally
they
were
called
on
it
and
the
ticket
was
ruled
by
a
number
courts.
it
has
all
been
ruled
by
a
number
of
courts
in
this
country
as
inadequate
and
not
complying
with
the
convention.
now,
much
is
being
made
of
the
difference
between
article
iii
and
article
iv
and
viii
to
drafting
difference.
and
i
respectfully
submit
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
it's
78
(a)
sir
of
the
record.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
57
(a)
is
another
reproduction
of
the
same
thing
that
was
made
by
the
defendant
to
support
of
its
affidavit
and
78
(a)
was
a
reproduction
made
in
the
official
opinion
of
judge
mcmahon
that
who
originally
ruled
upon
commotion.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
there's
an
attempt
to
include
them
that
gets
me
to
another
point.
when
i
say
attempt
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
but
may
i
qualify
that
answer,
and
i
meant
in
this
sense
sir
that
there's
another
point
in
my
brief
which
is
that
even
if
you
could
read
these
conditions,
that
they
are
unintelligible
and
that
it
is
it
says
that
the
warsaw
convention
may
apply.
if
it
involves
unnamed
countries
and
may
--
in
other
words
it
may
apply
as
it
applies
and
which
is
an
unequivocal,
qualified
conditional
statement
and
it
doesn't
tell
the
passenger
that
is
actually
traveling
subject
to
the
warsaw
convention.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
clear
statement
of
that
anyway
even
if
you
could
read
it.
and
by
that
sir
that
is
why
i
hesitated
to
reply
to
your
question.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
that's
correct
sir.
that's
right
it
can
not
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
78
(a),
yes
sir.
and
it
was
a
found
unreadable
by
the
district
judge,
it
was
found
unreadable
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well
they
looked
at
it.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
i
guess
your
honor
they
go
by
what
the
average,
the
average
person
sees
when
he
looks
at
it
and
i
guess
some
of
us
are
blessed
with
keener
eyesight
than
others.
they
found
that
it
was
so
microscopic
and
such
a
mass
of
what
would
appear
a
print
that
it
could
not
be
read.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
80
(a)
is
one
of
the
ticket
coupons
sir,
and
it's
at
78
(a)
would
be
on
the
back.
yes.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes,
there's
a
reference
there
at
sir,
on
80
(a),
right
at
the
bottom
of
the
coupon.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well
no,
there
was
just
a
reference,
a
reference
on
the
face
of
coupon
the
italian
language.but
the
conditions
were
in
english.
the
--
this
being
an
italian
carrier,
there
may
have
been
another
page
of
conditions
that
was
in
italian.
but
my
point
was
that
the,
with
respect
to
the
como
passenger,
this
is
the
plaintiff,
the
ticket
have
been
issued
in
tunisia,
where
the
official
language
is
arabic
that
should've
been
in
arabic.
for
example,
if
you
have
a
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
and
because
you
don't
have
actual
notice,
you
have
imputed
notice.
and
therefore
if
have
imputed
notice
it
should
be
in
the
notice
of
the
language
of
the
country
where
the
contract
is
made.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well
then,
then
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
unfortunate,
if
you
bought
the
ticket
for
example
because
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
it
wouldn't
make
a
difference
to
you.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
wouldn't
make
any
difference
to
you
except
that
the
operation
law
it
would
work
against
you.
for
example,
suppose
you're
an
american
passenger,
american,
you
bought
a
ticket
in
tokyo
to
the
united
states
and
naturally
the
ticket
–
you
buy
it
on
japanese
airlines,
the
ticket
would
be
printed
on
japanese.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
that's
correct
sir,
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir,
that's
right.
but
if
the
issue
--
if
you're
issued
in
tunisia
where
the
official
language
is
arabic,
i
say
it
has
to
be
issued
in
arabic.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes.
but
that
would
depend
if
you
could
show
actual
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
passenger
could
read
english.
for
example,
supposed
you
bought
a
ticket
in
japan
and
the
ticket
was
printed
in
japanese.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
it
would
it
could
be
any
language
the
carrier
chose,
they
may
--
would
they
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
it
could
be
italian
and
japanese,
that's
right
and
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes,
but
it
would
still
be
binding
on
you
to
be
printed
japanese
you
bought
in
japan
would
be
binding
on
you
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
oh
yes,
i
don't
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
there's
any
inference
on
the
part
of
the
appellant
that
the
claim
of
actual
notice,
of
course
not.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
that
only
applies
to
the
–
this
is
the
funny
passenger
sir.
because
this
--
that's
only
claim
as
to
that
and
this.
they
were
one
of
this
groups
that
originated
in
tunisia,
that's
just
a
special
situation.but
as
far
as
the
others
are
concerned
there's
no
such
issue
raised
sir.
you
know,
if
it
was
in
english
and
italian
and
if
the
language
--
if
the
language
is
no
problem
there.
they're
only
talking
about
the
imputed
knowledge.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
at
the
hague
conference?
that
was
in
1955
sir.
well,
in
the
hague
conference
there
was
a
discussion
of
amending
article
iii
to
add
a
specific
provision
that
is
subject
to
the
warsaw
convention
as
the
mandatory
item.
and
that
did
not
change
anything,
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief
because
it
was
already
there.
it
merely
helped
to
clarify
it
because
of
a
fact
that
–-
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
all
the
sanction
was
already
there
sir
but
it
merely
was
an
amended
–
an
approval
in
the
language.
and
actually
the
real
purpose
it
was,
when
they
say
it
shall
be
prima
facie
evidence
of
the
contract
the
ticket
shall
be
prima
facie
evidence
of
contract,
the
real
purpose
it
was,
was
to
prevent
the
passenger
for
what
any
time
raising
any
issue
in
the
future
as
to
the
adequacy
of
the
ticket.
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
hague
protocol
as
to
article
iii.
as
a
matter
of
fact
another
of
the
hague
protocol
which
i
might
say
generally
was
to
plug
loopholes
real
or
fancy
in
the
warsaw
convention.
and
they
changed
article
25
or
willful
misconduct
to
make
it
stronger,
so
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
prove
willful
misconduct
short
of
murder
or
attempted
murder.
and
they
also
eliminated
this
possibility
of
an
action
against
the
pilot
separately.
so,
they
were
already
plugging
loopholes.
they
weren't
really
changing
anything
basically.
and
the
united
states
and
as
a
sub
to
that,
they
added
$88,000.00.
and
the
united
states
of
course
did
not
adhere
to
work
for
the
various
reasons
that
i
have
guessed
given.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
they
got
on
--
all
except
the
discofanny
family.
there
were
five
families
on
here
sir,
they
got
on
a
plane
at
rome.
and
that
--
and
i'd
like
to
make
clear
there
is
no
question
as
to
all
of
these
families
as
to
the
language
used.
they
--
the
ticket
was
in
italian
or
english.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
the
language
--
the
language
of
the
ticket
was
in
both
italian
and
english
so
there's
no
question
to
that.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well
the
–-
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
it's
illegible.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
that's
correct
sir.
that's
right
and
it's
the
--
and
also
as
to
the
language
of
the
provision.
i'm
talking
about
language
and
i'm
talking
about
words
that
it
is
not
clearly
stated
that
the
transportation
is
subject
to
the
warsaw
convention
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir,
that's
right
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well
the
--
this
crash
have
taken
place
in
ireland
sir,
the
law
of
ireland
would
govern
it.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
no
sir
because
the
crash
took
place
there.
yes
sir.
except
that
as
your
honors
familiar
where
the
change
in
the
choice
of
law
theory,
for
example,
if
you
bought
a
roundtrip,
new
york
to
rome
and
new
york
that
it
might
be
held
under
the
modern
choice
of
law
theory
that
the
--
even
though
the
accident
took
place
in
ireland
that
the
law
of
new
york
applies.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
yes,
the
law
of
ireland
follows
the
fatal
accidents
act
of
england
and
it's
the
same
ordinary
in
negligence
with
the
unlimited
damages
that
is
damages
that
you
can
prove.
and
it's
basically
the
same
as
the
law
of
the
united
states.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
no
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir,
there
was
a
montreal
agreement.
the
united
states
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
in
'66,
the
united
states
is
about
to
denounce
the
warsaw
convention
all
together
withdraw
and
had
served
notice
under
provisions
of
the
warsaw
convention
that
it
was
withdrawing.
and
there
was
a
lot
behind-the-scenes
negotiation
going
on
and
on
the
very
last
day
when
the
air
carriers
agreed
to
fly
paris,
raising
the
limit
of
liability
to
$75,000.00,
the
united
states
withdrew
its
denunciation.
and
that
incidentally
those
atones
that's
not
an
amendment
of
the
treaty.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
no
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
no.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well
that
was
on
the
civil
aeronautics
board,
a
regulation
sir.
and
that
came
about
in
this
fashion.
the
civil
aeronautics
board,
from
time
to
time
is
asked
to
--
because
of
the
antitrust
laws
involved
is
asked
to
approve
resolutions
between
various
international
carriers
where
the
--
whereby
the
fixed
rates
and
certain
practices.
and
this
resolutions
have
to
be
approved
under
the
civil
aeronautics
act
otherwise
they
run
into
the
antitrust
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
and
that's
how
it
came
up,
but
there
was
no
expressed
approval
of
the
ticket.
as
such
in
any
time
by
the
civil
aeronautics
board,
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
they
indicated
that
they
disapproved
of
it
in
the
form
it
is
now.
and
that
the
civil
aeronautics
board
has
filed
a
brief
amicus
in
this
court.
and
which
would
explain
exactly
what
it
did
and
as
to
the
united
states
showing
that
the
policy
of
the
united
states
was
that
notice
that
this
ticket
was
inadequate
a
notice
should
be
required,
it
was
filed
by
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
that
was
inadequate
because
of
the
--
its
readability
because
of
the
plaintiff.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
i
would
say
sir
of
a
number
of
grounds
that
was
a
culmination
of
many
years
of
discussion
in
this
country,
because
at
the
time
the
warsaw
convention
was
adhered
by
this
country,
there
was
no
public
discussion
at
all
in
the
senate
and
it
was
a
time
when
nobody
pay
any
attention
to,
what
much
interested
in
international
air
transportation
and
it
just
quietly
happened.
and
then
since
international
transportation
impinged
more
to
the
public
consciousness,
everyone's
traveling
then
warsaw
suddenly
became
noticeable.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
no
sir.
most
of
them
were
residence
of
new
york.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
and
as
for
the
discofanny
family
they
were
immigrating
to
new
york
so
for
all
practical
purpose,
they're
going
to
be
residents
and
they
still
are
residents
of
new
york
that
is
the
survivor.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well
–-
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well
–-
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
he
could've
gone
by
steamer
for
one.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
he
could've
gone
by
steam
ship
number
one
which
many
consider
whether
just
to
be
or
not
i
won't
say,
a
more
reliable
form
of
transportation
involving
less
risks.
he
could've
gotten
more
insurance
for
another
or
he
could've
gotten
insurance,
and
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
if
he
knew
--
if
he
knew
that
his
recovery
would
be
limited
he'd
have
to
know
that
first
sir,
but
he
didn't
know
that.
and
the
only
way
he
could
know
that
was
to
have
a
warning
given
to
him
with
the
ticket.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
no
sir.
my
argument
hinges
upon
two
things.
that
the
--
it
is
not
readable
and
even
if
readable
it
does
not
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
dimension
because
it
does
not
fulfill
all
the
conditions
including
proper
notice.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
it
has
the
name
of
the
carrier,
may
not
have
the
address
but
i
don't
think
that's
particularly
material
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
e,
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
i
think
that
that
statement
has
to
be
clearer
and
unequivocal
and
i
think
it
has
the
state
that
the
--
and
very
clear
prominent
way
that
there
is
a
limitation
of
liability.
and
that
the
amount
of
recovery
will
be
limited.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
there
are
two
things
that
its
here.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
you
see,
if
you
can
read
it,
number
one,
an
number
two
it
has
to
be
intelligible,
it
has
to
tell
the
passenger
what
it
supposed
to
tell
him
and
it
doesn't
do
it.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
that's
it
warsaw
convention
maybe,
but
you
see
there
isn't
any
clear
and
definite
statement
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
right
it
does,
that's
correct
sir.
it
doesn't
say
that
this
is
transportation
subject
to
the
warsaw
convention.
there
isn't
any
clear
equivocal
statement
and
that
the
--
and
doesn't
say
this
transportation
is
subject
limited
liability.
it
doesn't
say
that.
in
other
words
the
passenger
does
not
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
i
would
say
--
it
doesn't
say
that
sir
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
i
don't
think
that's
enough,
i
think
it
has
adhering
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
i
would
say
that
it
should
say
that
if
you're
killed
or
injured
that
there's
a
limitation
of
liability
on
the
amount
you
can
recover
in
the
sum
of
$82,090.00.
and
that
the
point
is
that
the
--
they
don't
even
say
it's
subject
to
which
is
the
--
and
it's
been
held,
there's
some
english
cases
that
i
cite
which
hold
that
that
is
deficient.
now,
the
convention
itself
would
have
no
purpose
in
opposing
this
one
sided
advantage
that
it
would
be
--
would
make
any
sense
unless
the
passenger
got
notice
of
what
was
involved.
because
otherwise
this
would
be
a
legislation
of
the
most
repugnant
kind
which
you
took
away
fundamental
rights
and
we
are
faced
with
this
extreme
position.
now,
the
difference
in
drafting
between
article
iii
and
article
iv
is
my
opinion
easily
explain
because
article
iv
we
have
unaccompanied
baggage,
article
viii
unaccompanied
goods.
you
have
to
make
certain
things
mandatory
because
otherwise
it
couldn't
identify
the
goods
or
couldn't
identify
the
baggage.
and
so
that
if
there's
anybody
going
to
be
penalized,
they
decided
to
be
the
carrier
rather
than
the
shipper
or
the
passenger
for
failure
to
state
these
very
fundamental
things,
so
there's
a
definite
difference.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
thank
you
sir.
