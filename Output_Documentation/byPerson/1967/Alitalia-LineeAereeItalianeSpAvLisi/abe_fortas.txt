justice
abe
fortas
well,
would've
be
fair
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
the
fact
that
article
iii
requires
not
only
that
a
ticket
must
be
delivered
to
the
passenger
but
also
that
the
ticket
must
contain
a
statement
that
the
transportation
is
subject
to
the
rules
relating
to
liability
established
by
this
convention?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
statement
when
the
treaty
speaks
in
terms
of
the
statement
it
speaks
that
it
means
a
statement
that
is
permanent
so
that
it's
easily
legible,
is
that
--
am
i
correct
in
that?
justice
abe
fortas
am
i
--
do
i
correctly
remember
forgive
me
for
passing
this
question,
i
don't
know
the
answer.
am
i
correct
in
remembering
that
the
solicitor
general
does
not
take
the
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
heard
no
one
stated
anymore
strongly
than
that
but
that's
not
the
way
i
read
it.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
is
a
--
what's
the
point
of
that
second
sentence
in
sub-paragraph
two
of
article
iii
upon
which
you
seem
to
rely
that
is
to
say
that
if
there
is
no
delivery
of
the
ticket
then
the
carrier
can't
prevail
itself
of
the
limitation
of
liability
provisions,
what's
the
point
of
it?
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
that
put
in
there?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
is
that?
what
is
the
relevant
purpose
of
the
ticket?
justice
abe
fortas
well
there's
nothing
in
here
that
says
that
if
the
passenger
loses
his
ticket
he
--
this
here
can't
claim
--
file
a
claim
under
this
for
wrong
for
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact
most
airplane
accidents
survival
is
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule
and
as
i
understand
it
no
person
with
experience
i
would
say
as
i
understand
it,
the
airs
would
have
a
little
difficulty
in
recovering
the
ticket
from
the
body
of
the
victim
of
an
airline
--
of
an
airplane
crash.
justice
abe
fortas
can't
be
that,
can
it
really?
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
know,
what
i
was
asking
a
connection
with
this
article
iii
which
i
gather
relates
to
liability
of
personal
injury,
what's
the
point
of
that,
provision
second
sentence
in
subparagraph
two,
unless
it
relates
to
notice
to
the
passengers?
justice
abe
fortas
well
it
conveys
notice
if
there
is.

justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
whether
a
part
form
the
one
or
two
english
cases
that
you
cite
your
brief,
there
are
no
other
decisions
of
the
courts
of
any
country
party
to
the
treaty
that
bear
