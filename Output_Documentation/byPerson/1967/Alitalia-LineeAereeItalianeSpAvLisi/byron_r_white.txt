justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me
mr.
tompkins
if
the
provisions
on
the
baggage
check
and
waybill
were
out
in
the
treaty,
what
would
your
argument
be
based
on
3
(2)?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
is
it
there
strong
argument
to
say
that
it,
--
that
the
--
you
have
to
use
--
you
have
to
deliver
a
ticket
and
the
question
is,
what
is
a
ticket?
in
other
provision
of
an
act
it
defines
what
a
ticket
is.
and
unless
you
deliver
a
piece
of
paper
meeting
those
definitions
you
have
and
deliver
the
ticket.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
to
what
it
should
contain?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
a
sanctuary
for
not
delivering
a
ticket.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
now
what
is
the
ticket?
ticket
is
a
piece
of
paper
with
the
following
things
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
treaty
says
--
the
treaty
says
the
ticket
shall
contain
certain
things
and
yet
certainly
it
can
be
argued
that
a
ticket
that
doesn't
contain
all
of
those
things
is
not
a
ticket.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
that's
a
different
argument
but
just
on
the
face
of
these
sections
that
argument
is
perfectly
sensible
argument
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
the
reference
to
these
other
sections?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if,
but
evidence
seem
what
their
intention
is
--
is
their
definition
of
what
the
ticket
should
contain
and
the
thing
--
and
a
piece
of
paper
without
those
things
isn't
a
ticket
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
the
irregularity
--
but
then
it
goes
and
says
failure
to
deliver
a
ticket.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
how
do
you
construe
the
first
sentence
--
the
first
part
of
32
where
it
says
that
the
absence
of
the
passenger
ticket
shall
not
affect
the
distance
or
validity
of
the
contract
which
nonetheless
be
subject
to
the
rules
of
this
convention?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
my
answer
on
the
irregularity
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
irregularity
is
the
same.
this
saving
for
irregularity,
you
now
--
you
now
agreed
isn't
related
to
the
limitation
of
liability
but
other
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
just
said
that
absence
did
the
same.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
the
ticket
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
a
ticket
can
be
a
ticket
even
if
it
leaves
our
some
of
these
things?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
helped
to
make
us
–-
provide
a
sanction
for
omitting
it?
justice
byron
r.
