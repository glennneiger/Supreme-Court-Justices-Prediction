chief

would
you
say
it
fulfilled
the
requirements
of
the
statute
if
it
was
just
a
card
like
this
saying
that
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
one
flight
from
this
country
to
rome
on
such
and
such
a
day,
and
such
and
such
a
time
naming
the
flight
then
containing
nothing
else,
would
that
be
a
ticket?
chief

earl

i
said
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
treaty.
chief

whatever
what?
chief

if
that
is
true
why
would
they
put
any
requirements
for
the

chief

i
beg
your
pardon?
chief

earl
warren
now
could
you
tell
me
that
if
the
passenger
ticket
is
not
delivered
then
i
take
it
that
the
limitation
does
not
apply?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
the
treaty
contemplated
that
if
a
passenger
got
the
very
limited
ticket
that
i've
mentioned
to
you
that
a
limitation
would
apply,
why
should
it
make
the
extreme
difference
to
say
that
the
limitation
would
not
apply
if
he
just
as
simple
statement
that
i
refer
to?
what
would
be
the
reason
for
that?
why
would
they
make
that
distinction?
chief

i

well
before
1929,
was
the
practice
not
to
give
people
their
traveler's
tickets
of
any
kind?
chief

earl
warren
well
if
they
intended
to
accomplish
the
result
that
you
argued
for,
i'm
just
wondering,
what
information
would
the
passenger
get
from
this
simple
ticket
that
i
described
to
you
that
should
put
him
under
the
limitation,
where
if
he
didn't
have
that
information
the
company
would
be
liable
for
any
damages
if
deferred.

and
nothing
else?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
that
that
will
discuss
them
that
to
better
to
have
that
language
should
have
made
the
difference
between
the
full
liability
and
limited
liability?
chief

wasn't
there
some

there
were
other

that
were
