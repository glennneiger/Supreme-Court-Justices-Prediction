mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
interpretation
of
a
treaty
of
the
united
states,
commonly
known
as
the
warsaw
convention.
very
briefly,
the
warsaw
convention
is
a
multi-nation
agreement
which
has
two
basic
objectives.
the
first
of
these
is
to
minimize
conflicts
of
law
which
arise
in
the
international
transportation
by
air,
of
passengers,
baggage
and
cargo.
the
second
objective
and
probably
the
more
important,
is
to
establish
throughout
the
world
the
uniform
rules
relating
to
a
liability
of
the
carrier.
the
fundamental
question
which
this
case
present
to
the
court,
is
whether
these
treaty
is
to
be
interpreted
and
applied
in
the
united
states,
on
a
basis
of
purely
local
concepts
of
law
and
policy
and
in
disregard
of
the
international
obligations
of
the
treaty.
the
facts
which
give
rise
to
this
question
are
not
in
dispute
and
maybe
briefly
summarized.
respondents
brought
damage
actions
in
the
district
court
in
connection
with
an
accident
which
occurred
in
ireland
in
1960.
these
actions
were
brought
in
behalf
of
13
passengers
who
were
killed,
injured
and
some
suffered
property
loses.
at
the
time
of
the
accident
and
again
this
is
not
in
dispute
each
of
these
passengers
was
traveling
on
a
passenger
ticket
and
baggage
check
which
provided
for
international
transpiration
within
the
meaning
of
article
i
of
the
treaty.
by
this
fact
alone,
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
apply
to
the
rights
of
the
parties
to
the
damage
actions.
in
answering
the
complaints,
the
petitioner
alleged
several
affirmative
defenses
based
upon
those
provisions
of
the
treaty
which
subject
to
proof
by
the
carrier
limit
or
exclude
to
carrier's
liability
for
the
damages
claim.
upon
motion
of
respondents,
district
court
granted
partial
summary
judgment
dismissing
these
affirmative
defenses
holding
that
the
treaty
provisions
limiting
liability
do
not
apply
unless
the
carrier
has
given
the
passenger
notice
of
the
application
of
these
provisions
to
his
transportation.
on
appeal
of
court
of
appeals
affirmed
in
a
two
to
one
decision.
the
court
below
has
held
that
this
treaty
in
united
states
shall
not
apply
insofar
as
limited
carriers
liability
unless
the
carrier
has
notified
the
passenger
before
him
that
on
a
journey
he
is
about
to
undertake
the
treaty
applies
and
limits
his
liability.
we
submit
that
this
decision
is
in
direct
conflict
with
the
intent
of
the
parties
to
this
treaty
as
expressed
in
a
plain
language
of
the
treaty
itself
and
confirmed
by
its
drafting
history.
furthermore,
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
they
purport
it
to
find
it
from
the
treaty
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
they
purport
it
to
find
it
from
the
treaty
but
there
is
no
notice
requirement
in
the
treaty
by
its
plain
language.
they
resorted
to
cases
which
dealt
primarily
with
the
timeliness
of
the
delivery
of
the
ticket
and
read
in
to
the
treaty
a
provision
which
the
parties
had
expressly
rejected
as
to
notice
and
which
the
parties
themselves
had
determined
going
to
be
added
by
amending
the
treaty
in
1955.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
you're
correct
in
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
say,
yes.
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
contrary
to
the
long
standing
practice
and
understanding
of
the
parties
themselves
including
the
united
states.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
and
that's
the
way
i
read
the
memorandum
of
the
solicitor
general
at
the
petition
level
and
i
would
point
out
that
we
are
unable
to
reconcile
a
position
to
taken
by
the
office
of
the
solicitor
general
with
the
official
position
of
the
united
states
at
the
hague
conference
in
1955.
the
court
below
in
the
finding
in
article
iii
a
requirement
of
notice
is
acting
in
direct
conflict
with
the
plain
language
of
that
article.
treaty
says
that
in
two
situations
and
only
two
situations,
the
provisions
excluding
or
limiting
liability
shall
not
apply.
the
first
of
these
is
if
the
carrier
is
guilty
of
willful
misconduct
and
we
are
not
concerned
with
that
in
this
case
before
this
court.
in
a
transportation
of
passengers,
the
second
situation
is
if
no
passenger
ticket
has
been
delivered.
at
the
court
below
has
read
in
to
the
treaty
a
third
situation
and
has
said
that
in
the
united
states
because
of
our
legal
system
which
requires
notice
of
limits
of
liability
where
you
seek
to
limit
liability
by
contract
at
this
treaty
shall
apply
in
united
states
to
require
notice.
plain
language
of
article
iii
expressly
limits
the
imposition
of
this
sanction
to
the
case
of
none
delivery
of
a
ticket.
article
iii
also
states
that
the
irregularity
of
the
ticket
shall
not
to
protect
the
application
of
the
provisions
of
the
convention.
when
we
contrast
this
with
two
other
articles
in
the
treaty
which
i
related
in
our
dealing
with
the
baggage
check
in
airway
bill
we
find
that
the
draft
is
imposed
the
same
sanction
where
none
delivery
of
the
baggage
check
or
none
use
of
the
airway
bill
as
in
the
case
of
the
passenger
ticket
but
the
scope
of
the
sanctions
is
in
more
contrast.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
it
relates
to
the
purpose
of
the
ticket
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
in
order
to
enable
a
passenger
to
establish
himself
as
a
passenger.
this
is
the
proof
of
the
fact
that
he
is
a
passenger
so
that
he
can
obtain
the
benefits
of
the
treaty.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
we
can't
if
you
take
a
situation
if
your
honor
please
where
as
was
present
in
the
merton's
and
warren
cases,
where
the
courts
found
that
the
sanction
article
iii
should
applied
because
passenger
had
accepted
before
delivery.
the
rules
of
the
treaty
relating
to
the
liability
of
the
carrier
commence
before
you
are
on
the
aircraft.
if
you
are
walking
out
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
well,
the
ticket
itself
under
the
treaty
if
you
were
to
assume
strict
adherence
with
the
particulars
in
article
iii
paragraph
one
would
not
convey
notice
of
any
limited
live
liability.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
merely
requires
a
statement.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
no,
it
does
not.
it
says
that
they
notice
merely
states
that
a
statement
that
the
transportation
is
subject
to
rules
relating
to
liability,
there
are
many
rules
in
a
treaty
not
relating
to
limitations
of
liability.
now,
in
article
iv
is
i
was
mentioning
the
sanction
is
imposed
not
only
for
none
delivery
of
the
baggage
check.
but
it
goes
further
and
states
that
the
same
sanction
shall
apply,
not
only
in
the
case
of
none
delivery
but
where
three
of
eight
items
of
information
are
remitted
from
the
baggage
check.
article
viii
lists
17
items
of
information
for
inclusion
in
the
airway
bill.
but
the
sanction
on
article
ix
applies
for
the
omission
of
ten
of
these,
in
addition
to
none
use
of
the
airway
bill.
but
when
we
go
back
to
article
iii
we
find
the
listing
of
five
items
of
information,
it
--
for
inclusion
of
passenger
ticket,
but
no
language
in
article
iii
extending
the
scope
of
the
sanction
to
cover
any
case
where
the
passenger
ticket
omits
any
of
the
particulars
in
the
first
paragraph
of
article
iii.
and
yet
the
court
has
said
in
disregard
of
this
language,
the
plain
language
of
the
treaty
that
the
sanction
on
article
iii
will
apply
in
the
united
states,
where
the
ticket
delivered
and
as
admitted
in
this
case
that
the
delivery
is
not
a
problem.
where
the
ticket
delivered
does
not
contain
an
effect,
one
of
the
particulars
listed
in
a
paragraph
one
of
article
iii
or
a
notice
of
the
limitation
of
liability.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
no,
they
did
not
concede
after
did
distinguish
there
earlier
decision,
where
they
had
affirmed
a
decision
of
the
district
court
in
a
case
where
the
agreed
stopping
places
had
been
left
out
for
ticket.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
no,
the
--
i'm
not
sure
as
you
are
but
the
--
the
drafters
where
very
clear
that
the
sanction
would
apply
for
the
none
use
of
the
documents
because
part
of
the
objective
of
the
treaty
was
to
have
the
carriers
use
the
documents.
the
sanction
would
apply
for
none
use,
and
when
the
came
to
the
baggage
check
in
airway
bill
they
went
further
and
determined
that
certain
information
must
be
included
in
a
document
otherwise
the
sanction
will
apply.
that
information
which
they
have
determined
must
be
in
the
documents
they
spelled
out
in
a
sanction
clause.
i'd
like
to
come
on
the
drafting
history.
when
the
parties
convened
in
1929
a
draft
convention
was
presented
which
had
been
in
preparation
for
approximately
four
years.
the
preliminary
draft
of
this
convention
contained
the
same
sections
for
the
passenger
ticket,
baggage
check
and
airway
bill.
these
sanctions
were
to
apply
in
the
preliminary
draft,
not
only,
were
no
document
was
used
but
also
with
the
document
did
not
contain
the
information
contain
in
the
draft
articles.
but
after
considerable
debate,
the
express
wording
of
article
iii
in
preliminary
draft
which
would've
extended
the
sanction
to
cases
where
the
passenger
ticket
omits
any
of
the
information
listed
therein
was
taken
out.
the
exact
words
were
deleted,
rejected
by
the
parties.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
i
would
premise
my
argument
on
the
plain
language
of
article
3
(2)
as
confirmed
by
its
drafting
history
and
the
after
to
the
price
to
amend
the
three
to
extend
it
to
cover
the
situation
which
the
court
below
says
it
covers
anyway.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
but
there
is
no
definition
in
the
treaty
if
you
are
to
please
of
what
ticket
should
be,
there
is
a
specification
of
what
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
what
it
should
contain,
but
no
sanction
is
imposed
by
the
treaty
for
the
fair
to
ticket
to
contain
any
of
the
information
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
well,
the
treaty
does
not
say
that.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
it
was
not
the
intention
of
the
parties
to
require
that
the
passenger
ticket
contain
these
when
the
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
except
that
what
you
have
to
do
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
no,
without
going
to
other
sections.
what
you
have
to
do
is
take
the
language
of
paragraph
two
which
says
that
it
shall
apply
where
you
have
--
a
passengers
accepted
without
a
passenger
have
been
delivered.
and
conclude
from
that,
that
the
parties
intended
that
that
apply
where
nothing
is
in
the
ticket.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
well,
you
have
to
then,
if
you
accept
that,
if
you
are
please
you
have
to
disregard
the
first
sentence
of
paragraph
two.
and
i'm
again
confining
myself,
as
you
suggested
to
the
language
of
the
treaty
in
this
article,
which
says
that
the
irregularity
of
the
ticket
shall
not
affect
the
existence
or
the
validity
of
the
contract
through
transportation
which
shall
nonetheless
be
subject
to
the
rules
of
the
convention.
by
that
if
you
say
that
delivery
in
the
second
sentence
means
delivery
of
a
ticket.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
that's
correct
and
if
you
say
that
failure
to
deliver
a
ticket
means
failure
to
deliver
a
ticket
containing
the
items
listed
above,
the
word
irregularity
becomes
meaningless.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
speaking
theoretically,
if
the
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
i
believe
it
would,
whatever
the
carriers
will
accept
as
valid
for
transportation
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
whatever
the
carriers
will
accept
as
valid
for
transportation
would
constitute
a
ticket
within
the
meaning
of
the
treaty.
we
have
to
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
they
are
--
i
do
not
believe
requirements,
they
are
in
a
sense
of
suggestions.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
they
are
suggestions
as
to
what
the
ticket
should
contain.
in
the
draft
convention
which
is
represented
to
the
parties
there
was
an
article
in
the
draft
treaty
which
said
the
carriers
must
use
the
form
of
documents
appended
to
this
treaty.
during
the
course
of
the
deliberations
that
article
was
deleted,
the
draft,
forms
of
documents
were
stricken
from
the
treaty
before
it
was
adopted
and
the
parties
agree.
and
this
is
in
the
minutes
which
we
have
referred
the
court
to
in
our
brief
that
no
compulsory
form
of
documents
is
required
under
the
treaty.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
to
word
shall
in
this
context
if
your
honor
please
does
not
mean
must.
unfortunately
in
a
diplomatic
french
we
do
not
always
have
the
precise
english
word
to
reflect
the
intent
of
the
parties.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
well
that
is
a
mandatory
requirement.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
well,
there
are
many
other
rules
if
your
honor
please
in
a
convention
which
do
not
relate
to
the
limitation.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
for
example
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
well,
that
would
be
true
in
the
irregularity
also.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
no,
it
covers
--
it
covers,
at
also
the
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
the
absence
would
not
--
the
absence
of
the
ticket
--
it
says
the
absence,
and
then
leave
out
the
irregular
or
lose,
the
absence
of
the
ticket
which
will
imply
none
delivery.
the
rules
shall
still
apply
and
this
was
decided
in
the
mertens
case
where
there
was
no
delivery,
the
court
still
had
to
determine
whether
it
had
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
case
under
the
treaty.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
again,
i
--
you
have
to
go
back
to
1929
and
examine
the
conditions
that
existed
then
to
answer
that
question
fully.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
you
have
to
go
back
to
1929
and
examine
the
conditions
existing
at
that
time
to
answer
that
question
fully.
1929
the
passengers
had
no
rights.
the
rights
between
passengers
and
carriers
were
determined
upon
the
basis
of
contracts
of
transportation
going
up
by
the
carrier.
and
in
most
countries,
including
england,
france,
germany,
these
contracts
were
in
forced
and
contract
clauses
disclaiming
all
liability
for
envy
or
dept
or
loss
were
enforced
in
those
courts.
the
governments
got
together
in
1929
to
change
that
system
and
do
away
with
contractual
systems
of
liability
completely
by
adopting
this
treaty
and
imposing
uniform
rules
of
liability
on
the
carrier
regardless
on
contractual
consent.
this
was
the
very
objective
of
the
treaty.
in
order
for
the
passenger
to
be
able
to
bring
himself
under
the
treaty
he
must
prove
his
status
as
a
passenger.
this
is
done
by
producing
the
passenger
ticket.
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
rules
would
apply
and
that
they
would
be
uniformly
applied,
a
severe
sanction
was
imposed
on
the
carrier
for
not
delivering
the
passenger,
a
passenger
ticket.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
the
practice
was
that
the
carrier
would
deliver
a
document
containing
a
contract
of
carriage
and
whether
a
boarding
pass
was
given
with
that
all
along
with
that
i
don't,
but
the
legal
rights
of
the
parties
were
determined
upon
the
basis
of
the
terms
of
the
contract
of
carriage
and
it
was
to
do
a
way
with
this
contractual
system
that
the
treat
was
adopted.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
on
that
simple
ticket
the
passenger
would
be
told
as
i
recall
your
description
where
he
was
going,
from
he
was
going
and
when
and
nothing
else.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
nothing
else.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
statement
listed
in
article
iii
to
convey
notice
of
a
limited
liability.
if
i
may
again
revert
to
the
--
my
description
of
the
condition
in
1929,
the
inclusion
of
this
statement
in
the
traffic
documents
is
to
alert
the
courts
to
the
fact
when
the
rights
are
before
the
court,
the
rules
of
liability
which
will
be
used
to
determine
to
respect
the
rights
of
parties
will
derive
from
this
treaty
and
no
other.
there
are
articles
in
this
treaty
declaring
null
and
void.
any
contract
clause
or
any
ticket
provision
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
treaty,
the
purpose
of
the
statement
is
similar
to
a
private
contract
where
you
might
say
the
rights
of
the
party
shall
be
determined
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
new
york.
this
is
the
only
purpose
of
that
statement
and
if
i
may
pass
approximately
30
years
beyond
1929,
in
1955
the
parties
to
warsaw
convention
met
at
the
hague
to
consider
several
proposals,
amending
the
warsaw
convention.
the
most
important
of
these
related
to
the
traffic
documents.
the
united
states
made
a
four
part
proposal
with
regard
to
article
iii.
first
of
part
was,
that
article
iii
be
amended
to
require
notice
and
for
the
first
time
in
history
of
the
treaty,
the
concept
of
notice
was
brought
into
it.
in
fact,
the
article
when
it
was
finally
adopted
and
drafted
used
the
french
word
“avi”
for
the
first
time.
the
original
french
language
of
the
1929
treaty
nowhere
contains
the
word
“avi”.
second
part
of
united
states
proposal
was,
that
the
sanction
on
article
iii
be
extended
from
its
1929
language,
to
cover
the
situation
where
the
passenger
ticket
did
not
contain
this
notice.
the
third
and
fourth
parts
of
the
proposal
related
to
the
sides
of
type,
notice
should
be
a
minimum
type
size,
so
notice
should
be
in
contrast
in
color.
in
the
united
states
proposal
was
adopted
in
two
respects.
the
treaty
was
amended.
notice
was
required
in
article
iii
in
the
passenger
ticket.
the
sanction
was
extended
to
apply
in
the
absence
of
this
notice.
the
proposals
with
regard
to
the
type
size
and
the
color
were
rejected.
now
the
hague
protocol,
although
signed
by
the
united
states
has
never
been
ratified.
it
is
not
in
effect
in
this
country.
they
did
not
come
into
effect
for
most
to
the
world
until
august
1,
1963
more
than
three
years
after
this
accident.
and
yet
the
court
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
the
main
reason
the
united
states
did
not
ratify
it
was
the
limitation
of
liability.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
the
only
one
i'm
aware
of
that
they
officially
objected
to
us
the
increase
of
the
limitation
to
approximately
$16,600.00.
they
consider
this
to
be
too
low.
and
for
that
reason
it
was
ratified.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
united
states
in
1955
considered
it
necessary
to
propose
and
achieve
an
amendment
of
the
treaty
to
require
notice
of
the
limits
of
liability,
to
extend
the
sanction
in
article
iii,
to
cover
situation
where
notice
was
not
given.
and
yet
the
court
below
has
read
the
1955
requirement
of
notice
and
to
the
1929
un-amended
treaty
and
as
applied
against
this
petitioner
the
1955
sanction.
now
we
should
submit
that
this
is
a
violation
of
the
international
obligations
of
the
united
states
and
we
know
of
no
better
way
to
describe
the
decision
and
the
words
of
judge
moore
and
his
dissenting
opinion
when
he
stated
the
majority
of
the
court
below,
do
not
approve
of
the
terms
of
the
treaty
and
by
judicial
fiat,
they
have
rewritten
it.
thank
you.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
on
the
precise
issue
before
this
court?
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
interpretation
of
a
treaty
of
the
united
states,
commonly
known
as
the
warsaw
convention.
very
briefly,
the
warsaw
convention
is
a
multi-nation
agreement
which
has
two
basic
objectives.
the
first
of
these
is
to
minimize
conflicts
of
law
which
arise
in
the
international
transportation
by
air,
of
passengers,
baggage
and
cargo.
the
second
objective
and
probably
the
more
important,
is
to
establish
throughout
the
world
the
uniform
rules
relating
to
a
liability
of
the
carrier.
the
fundamental
question
which
this
case
present
to
the
court,
is
whether
these
treaty
is
to
be
interpreted
and
applied
in
the
united
states,
on
a
basis
of
purely
local
concepts
of
law
and
policy
and
in
disregard
of
the
international
obligations
of
the
treaty.
the
facts
which
give
rise
to
this
question
are
not
in
dispute
and
maybe
briefly
summarized.
respondents
brought
damage
actions
in
the
district
court
in
connection
with
an
accident
which
occurred
in
ireland
in
1960.
these
actions
were
brought
in
behalf
of
13
passengers
who
were
killed,
injured
and
some
suffered
property
loses.
at
the
time
of
the
accident
and
again
this
is
not
in
dispute
each
of
these
passengers
was
traveling
on
a
passenger
ticket
and
baggage
check
which
provided
for
international
transpiration
within
the
meaning
of
article
i
of
the
treaty.
by
this
fact
alone,
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
apply
to
the
rights
of
the
parties
to
the
damage
actions.
in
answering
the
complaints,
the
petitioner
alleged
several
affirmative
defenses
based
upon
those
provisions
of
the
treaty
which
subject
to
proof
by
the
carrier
limit
or
exclude
to
carrier's
liability
for
the
damages
claim.
upon
motion
of
respondents,
district
court
granted
partial
summary
judgment
dismissing
these
affirmative
defenses
holding
that
the
treaty
provisions
limiting
liability
do
not
apply
unless
the
carrier
has
given
the
passenger
notice
of
the
application
of
these
provisions
to
his
transportation.
on
appeal
of
court
of
appeals
affirmed
in
a
two
to
one
decision.
the
court
below
has
held
that
this
treaty
in
united
states
shall
not
apply
insofar
as
limited
carriers
liability
unless
the
carrier
has
notified
the
passenger
before
him
that
on
a
journey
he
is
about
to
undertake
the
treaty
applies
and
limits
his
liability.
we
submit
that
this
decision
is
in
direct
conflict
with
the
intent
of
the
parties
to
this
treaty
as
expressed
in
a
plain
language
of
the
treaty
itself
and
confirmed
by
its
drafting
history.
furthermore,
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
they
purport
it
to
find
it
from
the
treaty
your
honor.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
they
purport
it
to
find
it
from
the
treaty
but
there
is
no
notice
requirement
in
the
treaty
by
its
plain
language.
they
resorted
to
cases
which
dealt
primarily
with
the
timeliness
of
the
delivery
of
the
ticket
and
read
in
to
the
treaty
a
provision
which
the
parties
had
expressly
rejected
as
to
notice
and
which
the
parties
themselves
had
determined
going
to
be
added
by
amending
the
treaty
in
1955.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
you're
correct
in
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
say,
yes.
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
contrary
to
the
long
standing
practice
and
understanding
of
the
parties
themselves
including
the
united
states.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
and
that's
the
way
i
read
the
memorandum
of
the
solicitor
general
at
the
petition
level
and
i
would
point
out
that
we
are
unable
to
reconcile
a
position
to
taken
by
the
office
of
the
solicitor
general
with
the
official
position
of
the
united
states
at
the
hague
conference
in
1955.
the
court
below
in
the
finding
in
article
iii
a
requirement
of
notice
is
acting
in
direct
conflict
with
the
plain
language
of
that
article.
treaty
says
that
in
two
situations
and
only
two
situations,
the
provisions
excluding
or
limiting
liability
shall
not
apply.
the
first
of
these
is
if
the
carrier
is
guilty
of
willful
misconduct
and
we
are
not
concerned
with
that
in
this
case
before
this
court.
in
a
transportation
of
passengers,
the
second
situation
is
if
no
passenger
ticket
has
been
delivered.
at
the
court
below
has
read
in
to
the
treaty
a
third
situation
and
has
said
that
in
the
united
states
because
of
our
legal
system
which
requires
notice
of
limits
of
liability
where
you
seek
to
limit
liability
by
contract
at
this
treaty
shall
apply
in
united
states
to
require
notice.
plain
language
of
article
iii
expressly
limits
the
imposition
of
this
sanction
to
the
case
of
none
delivery
of
a
ticket.
article
iii
also
states
that
the
irregularity
of
the
ticket
shall
not
to
protect
the
application
of
the
provisions
of
the
convention.
when
we
contrast
this
with
two
other
articles
in
the
treaty
which
i
related
in
our
dealing
with
the
baggage
check
in
airway
bill
we
find
that
the
draft
is
imposed
the
same
sanction
where
none
delivery
of
the
baggage
check
or
none
use
of
the
airway
bill
as
in
the
case
of
the
passenger
ticket
but
the
scope
of
the
sanctions
is
in
more
contrast.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
it
relates
to
the
purpose
of
the
ticket
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
in
order
to
enable
a
passenger
to
establish
himself
as
a
passenger.
this
is
the
proof
of
the
fact
that
he
is
a
passenger
so
that
he
can
obtain
the
benefits
of
the
treaty.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
we
can't
if
you
take
a
situation
if
your
honor
please
where
as
was
present
in
the
merton's
and
warren
cases,
where
the
courts
found
that
the
sanction
article
iii
should
applied
because
passenger
had
accepted
before
delivery.
the
rules
of
the
treaty
relating
to
the
liability
of
the
carrier
commence
before
you
are
on
the
aircraft.
if
you
are
walking
out
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
well,
the
ticket
itself
under
the
treaty
if
you
were
to
assume
strict
adherence
with
the
particulars
in
article
iii
paragraph
one
would
not
convey
notice
of
any
limited
live
liability.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
merely
requires
a
statement.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
no,
it
does
not.
it
says
that
they
notice
merely
states
that
a
statement
that
the
transportation
is
subject
to
rules
relating
to
liability,
there
are
many
rules
in
a
treaty
not
relating
to
limitations
of
liability.
now,
in
article
iv
is
i
was
mentioning
the
sanction
is
imposed
not
only
for
none
delivery
of
the
baggage
check.
but
it
goes
further
and
states
that
the
same
sanction
shall
apply,
not
only
in
the
case
of
none
delivery
but
where
three
of
eight
items
of
information
are
remitted
from
the
baggage
check.
article
viii
lists
17
items
of
information
for
inclusion
in
the
airway
bill.
but
the
sanction
on
article
ix
applies
for
the
omission
of
ten
of
these,
in
addition
to
none
use
of
the
airway
bill.
but
when
we
go
back
to
article
iii
we
find
the
listing
of
five
items
of
information,
it
--
for
inclusion
of
passenger
ticket,
but
no
language
in
article
iii
extending
the
scope
of
the
sanction
to
cover
any
case
where
the
passenger
ticket
omits
any
of
the
particulars
in
the
first
paragraph
of
article
iii.
and
yet
the
court
has
said
in
disregard
of
this
language,
the
plain
language
of
the
treaty
that
the
sanction
on
article
iii
will
apply
in
the
united
states,
where
the
ticket
delivered
and
as
admitted
in
this
case
that
the
delivery
is
not
a
problem.
where
the
ticket
delivered
does
not
contain
an
effect,
one
of
the
particulars
listed
in
a
paragraph
one
of
article
iii
or
a
notice
of
the
limitation
of
liability.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
no,
they
did
not
concede
after
did
distinguish
there
earlier
decision,
where
they
had
affirmed
a
decision
of
the
district
court
in
a
case
where
the
agreed
stopping
places
had
been
left
out
for
ticket.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
no,
the
--
i'm
not
sure
as
you
are
but
the
--
the
drafters
where
very
clear
that
the
sanction
would
apply
for
the
none
use
of
the
documents
because
part
of
the
objective
of
the
treaty
was
to
have
the
carriers
use
the
documents.
the
sanction
would
apply
for
none
use,
and
when
the
came
to
the
baggage
check
in
airway
bill
they
went
further
and
determined
that
certain
information
must
be
included
in
a
document
otherwise
the
sanction
will
apply.
that
information
which
they
have
determined
must
be
in
the
documents
they
spelled
out
in
a
sanction
clause.
i'd
like
to
come
on
the
drafting
history.
when
the
parties
convened
in
1929
a
draft
convention
was
presented
which
had
been
in
preparation
for
approximately
four
years.
the
preliminary
draft
of
this
convention
contained
the
same
sections
for
the
passenger
ticket,
baggage
check
and
airway
bill.
these
sanctions
were
to
apply
in
the
preliminary
draft,
not
only,
were
no
document
was
used
but
also
with
the
document
did
not
contain
the
information
contain
in
the
draft
articles.
but
after
considerable
debate,
the
express
wording
of
article
iii
in
preliminary
draft
which
would've
extended
the
sanction
to
cases
where
the
passenger
ticket
omits
any
of
the
information
listed
therein
was
taken
out.
the
exact
words
were
deleted,
rejected
by
the
parties.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
i
would
premise
my
argument
on
the
plain
language
of
article
3
(2)
as
confirmed
by
its
drafting
history
and
the
after
to
the
price
to
amend
the
three
to
extend
it
to
cover
the
situation
which
the
court
below
says
it
covers
anyway.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
but
there
is
no
definition
in
the
treaty
if
you
are
to
please
of
what
ticket
should
be,
there
is
a
specification
of
what
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
what
it
should
contain,
but
no
sanction
is
imposed
by
the
treaty
for
the
fair
to
ticket
to
contain
any
of
the
information
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
well,
the
treaty
does
not
say
that.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
it
was
not
the
intention
of
the
parties
to
require
that
the
passenger
ticket
contain
these
when
the
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
except
that
what
you
have
to
do
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
no,
without
going
to
other
sections.
what
you
have
to
do
is
take
the
language
of
paragraph
two
which
says
that
it
shall
apply
where
you
have
--
a
passengers
accepted
without
a
passenger
have
been
delivered.
and
conclude
from
that,
that
the
parties
intended
that
that
apply
where
nothing
is
in
the
ticket.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
well,
you
have
to
then,
if
you
accept
that,
if
you
are
please
you
have
to
disregard
the
first
sentence
of
paragraph
two.
and
i'm
again
confining
myself,
as
you
suggested
to
the
language
of
the
treaty
in
this
article,
which
says
that
the
irregularity
of
the
ticket
shall
not
affect
the
existence
or
the
validity
of
the
contract
through
transportation
which
shall
nonetheless
be
subject
to
the
rules
of
the
convention.
by
that
if
you
say
that
delivery
in
the
second
sentence
means
delivery
of
a
ticket.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
that's
correct
and
if
you
say
that
failure
to
deliver
a
ticket
means
failure
to
deliver
a
ticket
containing
the
items
listed
above,
the
word
irregularity
becomes
meaningless.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
speaking
theoretically,
if
the
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
i
believe
it
would,
whatever
the
carriers
will
accept
as
valid
for
transportation
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
whatever
the
carriers
will
accept
as
valid
for
transportation
would
constitute
a
ticket
within
the
meaning
of
the
treaty.
we
have
to
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
they
are
--
i
do
not
believe
requirements,
they
are
in
a
sense
of
suggestions.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
they
are
suggestions
as
to
what
the
ticket
should
contain.
in
the
draft
convention
which
is
represented
to
the
parties
there
was
an
article
in
the
draft
treaty
which
said
the
carriers
must
use
the
form
of
documents
appended
to
this
treaty.
during
the
course
of
the
deliberations
that
article
was
deleted,
the
draft,
forms
of
documents
were
stricken
from
the
treaty
before
it
was
adopted
and
the
parties
agree.
and
this
is
in
the
minutes
which
we
have
referred
the
court
to
in
our
brief
that
no
compulsory
form
of
documents
is
required
under
the
treaty.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
to
word
shall
in
this
context
if
your
honor
please
does
not
mean
must.
unfortunately
in
a
diplomatic
french
we
do
not
always
have
the
precise
english
word
to
reflect
the
intent
of
the
parties.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
well
that
is
a
mandatory
requirement.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
well,
there
are
many
other
rules
if
your
honor
please
in
a
convention
which
do
not
relate
to
the
limitation.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
for
example
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
well,
that
would
be
true
in
the
irregularity
also.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
no,
it
covers
--
it
covers,
at
also
the
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
the
absence
would
not
--
the
absence
of
the
ticket
--
it
says
the
absence,
and
then
leave
out
the
irregular
or
lose,
the
absence
of
the
ticket
which
will
imply
none
delivery.
the
rules
shall
still
apply
and
this
was
decided
in
the
mertens
case
where
there
was
no
delivery,
the
court
still
had
to
determine
whether
it
had
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
case
under
the
treaty.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
again,
i
--
you
have
to
go
back
to
1929
and
examine
the
conditions
that
existed
then
to
answer
that
question
fully.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
you
have
to
go
back
to
1929
and
examine
the
conditions
existing
at
that
time
to
answer
that
question
fully.
1929
the
passengers
had
no
rights.
the
rights
between
passengers
and
carriers
were
determined
upon
the
basis
of
contracts
of
transportation
going
up
by
the
carrier.
and
in
most
countries,
including
england,
france,
germany,
these
contracts
were
in
forced
and
contract
clauses
disclaiming
all
liability
for
envy
or
dept
or
loss
were
enforced
in
those
courts.
the
governments
got
together
in
1929
to
change
that
system
and
do
away
with
contractual
systems
of
liability
completely
by
adopting
this
treaty
and
imposing
uniform
rules
of
liability
on
the
carrier
regardless
on
contractual
consent.
this
was
the
very
objective
of
the
treaty.
in
order
for
the
passenger
to
be
able
to
bring
himself
under
the
treaty
he
must
prove
his
status
as
a
passenger.
this
is
done
by
producing
the
passenger
ticket.
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
rules
would
apply
and
that
they
would
be
uniformly
applied,
a
severe
sanction
was
imposed
on
the
carrier
for
not
delivering
the
passenger,
a
passenger
ticket.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
the
practice
was
that
the
carrier
would
deliver
a
document
containing
a
contract
of
carriage
and
whether
a
boarding
pass
was
given
with
that
all
along
with
that
i
don't,
but
the
legal
rights
of
the
parties
were
determined
upon
the
basis
of
the
terms
of
the
contract
of
carriage
and
it
was
to
do
a
way
with
this
contractual
system
that
the
treat
was
adopted.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
on
that
simple
ticket
the
passenger
would
be
told
as
i
recall
your
description
where
he
was
going,
from
he
was
going
and
when
and
nothing
else.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
nothing
else.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
statement
listed
in
article
iii
to
convey
notice
of
a
limited
liability.
if
i
may
again
revert
to
the
--
my
description
of
the
condition
in
1929,
the
inclusion
of
this
statement
in
the
traffic
documents
is
to
alert
the
courts
to
the
fact
when
the
rights
are
before
the
court,
the
rules
of
liability
which
will
be
used
to
determine
to
respect
the
rights
of
parties
will
derive
from
this
treaty
and
no
other.
there
are
articles
in
this
treaty
declaring
null
and
void.
any
contract
clause
or
any
ticket
provision
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
treaty,
the
purpose
of
the
statement
is
similar
to
a
private
contract
where
you
might
say
the
rights
of
the
party
shall
be
determined
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
new
york.
this
is
the
only
purpose
of
that
statement
and
if
i
may
pass
approximately
30
years
beyond
1929,
in
1955
the
parties
to
warsaw
convention
met
at
the
hague
to
consider
several
proposals,
amending
the
warsaw
convention.
the
most
important
of
these
related
to
the
traffic
documents.
the
united
states
made
a
four
part
proposal
with
regard
to
article
iii.
first
of
part
was,
that
article
iii
be
amended
to
require
notice
and
for
the
first
time
in
history
of
the
treaty,
the
concept
of
notice
was
brought
into
it.
in
fact,
the
article
when
it
was
finally
adopted
and
drafted
used
the
french
word
“avi”
for
the
first
time.
the
original
french
language
of
the
1929
treaty
nowhere
contains
the
word
“avi”.
second
part
of
united
states
proposal
was,
that
the
sanction
on
article
iii
be
extended
from
its
1929
language,
to
cover
the
situation
where
the
passenger
ticket
did
not
contain
this
notice.
the
third
and
fourth
parts
of
the
proposal
related
to
the
sides
of
type,
notice
should
be
a
minimum
type
size,
so
notice
should
be
in
contrast
in
color.
in
the
united
states
proposal
was
adopted
in
two
respects.
the
treaty
was
amended.
notice
was
required
in
article
iii
in
the
passenger
ticket.
the
sanction
was
extended
to
apply
in
the
absence
of
this
notice.
the
proposals
with
regard
to
the
type
size
and
the
color
were
rejected.
now
the
hague
protocol,
although
signed
by
the
united
states
has
never
been
ratified.
it
is
not
in
effect
in
this
country.
they
did
not
come
into
effect
for
most
to
the
world
until
august
1,
1963
more
than
three
years
after
this
accident.
and
yet
the
court
--
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
the
main
reason
the
united
states
did
not
ratify
it
was
the
limitation
of
liability.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
the
only
one
i'm
aware
of
that
they
officially
objected
to
us
the
increase
of
the
limitation
to
approximately
$16,600.00.
they
consider
this
to
be
too
low.
and
for
that
reason
it
was
ratified.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
united
states
in
1955
considered
it
necessary
to
propose
and
achieve
an
amendment
of
the
treaty
to
require
notice
of
the
limits
of
liability,
to
extend
the
sanction
in
article
iii,
to
cover
situation
where
notice
was
not
given.
and
yet
the
court
below
has
read
the
1955
requirement
of
notice
and
to
the
1929
un-amended
treaty
and
as
applied
against
this
petitioner
the
1955
sanction.
now
we
should
submit
that
this
is
a
violation
of
the
international
obligations
of
the
united
states
and
we
know
of
no
better
way
to
describe
the
decision
and
the
words
of
judge
moore
and
his
dissenting
opinion
when
he
stated
the
majority
of
the
court
below,
do
not
approve
of
the
terms
of
the
treaty
and
by
judicial
fiat,
they
have
rewritten
it.
thank
you.
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
on
the
precise
issue
before
this
court?
mr.
george
n.
tompkins,
jr.
that's
correct.
