justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
did
the
court
concede
that
--
the
below
concede
that
the
sanction
wouldn't
be
applied
if
the
ticket
omitted
some
of
the
items
specified
for
inclusion
of
the
ticket?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
you
can
interpret
it
baggage
check
in
way
bill
sections
as
meaning
that
there
are
some
items
of
omission
for
which
sanction
is
not
applied.
otherwise
the
sanction
is
regularly
applied
and
hence
if
you
don't
put
a
limitation
in,
why
the
sanction
applies
in
case
of
any
omission.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
all
five
could
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
fact,
are
all
of
the
conditions
3
(a)
(1)
action
would
be
separate
to
the
same
reading?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
before
you
can
tell
me,
are
in
fact
each
of
the
articles
(a)
and
(b)
included
in
same
reading?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
what
80
(a),
is
that
the
outburst
side
of
the
–
that
something
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
now
that
i
notice
to
be
possibly
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
moved
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
that
it
should've
been
in
arabic?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
couldn't
read
arabic
either.
either
that
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
couldn't
read
italian
or
arabic,
what
difference
would
it
make
to
me
if
i
can't?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
it's
imputed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
this
on
it
appears,
the
notice
at
the
bottom
of
80
(a)
is
both
italian
and
english.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
can
read
the
english.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
it
would
still
be
arabic
and
english
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
can
still
read
the
english.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
would
it
be
only
japanese
or
is
it
always
in
both
languages
english
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
might
be
italian
and
japanese.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
would
be
badly
off.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
i
would
be
badly
off.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
imputed
--
you
certainly
conceded
that
imputed
notice
not
actual
notice
as
sufficient
to
limit
liabilities.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
this
could
have
been
an
inch
high
letters
in
arabic
that
i
can't
read
and
it
would've
been
alright
but
because
it's
in
this
very
small
point
arabic
then
i'm
damaged
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
they,
at
the
hague
what
kind
of
notice
was
required?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
is
the
question,
whether
--
if
the
provision
is
there
that
the
section
3
requires.
what
is
the
question
because
it's
not
easily
read
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
you
can't
read
at
all,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
holding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
tantamount
to
not
having
a
provision
at
all,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
you
mean
even
if
it
can
be
read?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
it
can
be
it,
it
isn't
--
it
doesn't
satisfy
the
requirement
of
those
three,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
changes
made
in
the
treaty
at
montreal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
none
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where'd
i
hear
something
of
a
provision
or
negotiated
provision
which
would've
required
notice
of
this
kind
in
ten
point
type,
where'd
i
hear
that
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
all
independent
of
the
treaty
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
because
the
print
or
inadequate
because
the
form
of
the
statement
doesn't
satisfy
section
3.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
which
one
of
the
five
or
all
of
which
does
not
to
satisfy?
it
has
the
place
and
date
of
issue
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
the
place
of
departure
and
destination?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
it
have
the
agreed
stopping
places?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
does?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
it
have
the
name
and
address
to
the
carrier
carriers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
that
really
comes
down
to
e,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
only
one
which
you
argue
it
does
comply.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
can
you
say
with
in
fact
does
tell
him?
what
does
it
tell
him?
i
can
read
most
of
it
“if
the
passenger's
journey
involves
an
element
destination
or
stop
in
a
country
other
than
the
country
of
departure
the
warsaw
convention
maybe”
and
then
it's
gone,
i
cant
follow
the
rest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that
doesn't
say
the
rules
providing
the
liability
that
this
transportation
is
subject
to
the
rules
relating
to
liability
established
by
this
convention?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that
if
it
had
said
only
what
e
says
if
the
only
statement
the
ticket
was
“this
transportation
is
subject
to
the
rules
relating
liability
established
by
the
warsaw
convention”
that's
not
enough?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
say
if
it
did
say
that,
you
could
still
say
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then
to
go
on
and
say
and
what
that
means
is
that
if
you're
there's
a
limitation
of
liability
at
$83,000.00
whatever
it
might
offer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
did
the
court
concede
that
--
the
below
concede
that
the
sanction
wouldn't
be
applied
if
the
ticket
omitted
some
of
the
items
specified
for
inclusion
of
the
ticket?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
you
can
interpret
it
baggage

in

bill
sections

why
the

of
any
omission.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
all
five
could
be

in

then

would

justice

so
imputed
