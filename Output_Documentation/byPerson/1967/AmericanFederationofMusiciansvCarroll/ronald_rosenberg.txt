mr.
ronald
rosenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
your
honors
on
cross
petitions
for
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit.
in
case
309,
the
american
federation
of
musicians
and
its
logo
late
02
seek
reversal
of
the
court
of
appeals
holding
to
which
judge
friendly
had
decided
that
certain
of
the
unions
regulations
constitute
price
fixing
and
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
in
case
number
310,
the
plaintiffs
four
professional
musicians
challenged
the
circuit
court's
unanimous
decision
that
a
host
of
other
practices
which
they
had
challenged
and
which
the
district
court
had
dismissed,
did
not
constitute
--
did
not
constitute
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws.
the
plaintiffs
had
raised
an
entire
series
of
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws
which
both
courts
below
categorized
into
set
--
eight
separate
categories
but
it
is
to
the
allegation
that
the
unions
violated
the
antitrust
laws,
the
predicate
of
the
majority
opinion
of
the
second
circuit
and
to
the
contention
that
the
unions
violate
the
antitrust
laws
by
accepting
so
called
orchestra
leaders
into
membership
that
i
will
address
to
my
remarks
primarily.
the
second
point
that
the
unions
violate
the
antitrust
laws
by
seeking
and
even
coercing
orchestra
leaders
into
membership,
i
will
address
myself
to
my
opening
remarks
because
in
our
view,
it
sheds
light
on
the
basic
contention
in
case
number
309,
the
price
fixing
charge
and
indeed
in
our
opinion,
the
answer
to
the
question
is
to
whether
or
not
the
union
may
admit
the
so
called
orchestra
leaders
into
membership
is
in
fact
conclusive
analytically
under
this
court's
decision
of
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
unions
may
legitimately
set
a
minimum
price
for
the
total
contribution
that
the
orchestra
leader
makes
to
the
so
called
purchase
or
the
music.
following
a
five
week
trial
on
this
entire
case
involving
myriad
of
issues,
judge
levet
who
had
had
a
certain
special
familiarity
with
the
industry,
with
the
practices
of
the
american
federation
of
musicians
due
to
a
length
of
this
particular
trial
and
to
his
participation
in
other
earlier
litigation
between
these
two
parties,
dismissed
the
complaints
in
their
entirety.
his
opinion
which
has
contained
of
course
in
the
record
contains
comprehensive
findings
of
fact
which
are
meticulously
annotated
to
the
lengthy
record
of
this
case.
and
he
as
i
have
indicated
dismissed
the
complaints
in
their
entirety.
we
rely
very
heavily
your
honors
upon
the
careful
findings
of
fact
that
the
trial
judge
made
in
this
case.
indeed,
these
findings
of
fact
lay
at
the
heart
of
this
case
and
in
the
findings
of
job
and
wage
competition
as
i
shall
attempt
to
show
to
you
your
honors
in
fact
or
conclusive
of
the
legitimacy
of
the
unions'
contentions
in
this
case.
although
the
plaintiff's
here
in
case
310
attack
the
unions'
regulations
and
so
far
as
they
pertain
in
all
fields
of
musical
endeavor,
both
courts
below
considered
that
the
primary
--
indeed
the
main
attack
concern
the
so
called
club-date
field
which
was
by
stipulation
said
to
be
single
engagements
concerning
social
affairs
such
as
bar
mitzvahs
or
weddings
and
other
comparable
social
events.
the
plaintiffs
in
fact
in
this
case,
the
four
remaining
plaintiffs
do
perform
and
there
is
a
finding
to
the
effect
that
they
perform
primarily
in
the
club-date
field.
the
so
called
non-club-date
field
would
include
theatrical
engagements,
opera
recordings,
nightclub
acts,
and
engagements
of
that
type.
the
club-date
field
again
is
single
engagements
concerning
social
affairs.
now,
in
order
to
understand
the
nature
of
this
particular
field
and
the
manner
which
these
particular
engagements
come
about,
it
might
be
helpful
to
describe
the
--
some
of
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
as
regards
the
method
by
which
a
so
called
club-date
comes
about.
normally,
the
purchaser
of
the
music,
the
sponsor
of
the
social
affair
will
approach
a
given
musician.
you
might
have
met
that
musician
before,
seen
them
in
the
previous
engagement
or
he
might
even
be
a
relative.
in
some
circumstances
where
the
fact
that
a
given
engagement
is
to
come
about
that
there
is
to
be
a
bar
mitzvah
that
there
is
to
be
a
wedding
is
known
the
musician
will
approach
the
sponsor
of
the
activity
himself
seeking
the
engagement.
now,
when
the
sponsor
of
the
engagement
in
the
pawns
of
the
trade,
the
purchase
of
the
music
engages
that
particular
musician
and
to
obtain
to
play
that
engagement
and
to
obtain
the
other
musicians
who
will
play,
that
leader
by
that
act
becomes
the
leader
for
the
engagement
and
he
then
undertakes
the
responsibility
of
playing
that
engagement,
obtaining
the
other
musicians
who
will
play
who
are
called
sidemen,
straight
instrumentalists.
now
the
particular
musician
who
has
assumed
the
responsibility
of
leader
might
be
acting
his
particular
time
for
a
leader
for
the
first
time
of
his
life,
for
the
hundredth
time
in
his
life,
he
might
--
the
very
afternoon
on
which
he
is
to
play
as
a
leader
that
evening,
perform
as
a
sidemen.
the
fluidity
and
the
interchangeability
of
functions
in
this
field
as
outlined
in
the
record
and
is
in
the
findings
of
fact
is
considerable.
musicians
perform
in
many
fields.
they
perform
in
the
club-date
field,
the
non-club-date
field.
they
are
sometimes
leader
and
sometimes
sidemen.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes
your
honor.
on
each
engagement,
there
will
be
someone
performing
the
leaders
function.
now
at
--
in
response
really
to
what
justice
harlan
has
just
said,
at
each
engagement,
there
will
be
a
person
who
will
perform
the
conducting
function
and
that
is
the
leader's
function,
the
obligation
to
conduct.
now
the
leader
will
also
and
almost
instances
playing
instrument
as
well
as
conduct.
the
sidemen
of
course
as
instrumentalist
do
playing
â€“
play
an
instrument.
now
there
are
occasions
in
this
field
in
which
the
particular
leader
in
question
might
have
two
or
more
engagements
on
the
same
night.
and
under
those
circumstances,
he
will
obtain
what
is
called
a
sub-leader
to
perform
the
leading
function,
to
do
the
conducting
at
that
particular
engagement.
so
that
in
essence,
there
are
the
sidemen
who
perform
as
instrumentalist,
the
sub-leader
who
both
conduct
and
generally
will
play
an
instrument
and
the
leader
who
will
conduct
if
he
is
present
to
a
particular
engagement
and
will
generally
play
an
instrument
as
well.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes.
that
is
the
--
the
person
who
does
the
obtaining
is
a
leader
but
the
conducting
function
might
be
performed
either
by
the
leader
or
by
a
sub-leader.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
the
conducting
function?
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well,
there
are
--
there
are
conceivable
occasions
on
which
the
person
is
obtaining
will
not
in
fact
perform
the
conducting
function
but
that
is
the
rarity
and
i
was
attempting
to
describe
the
basic
pattern.
now,
although
the
unions
contended
that
the
original
trial
of
the
case
that
the
leaders
in
this
circumstances
are
not
employers
in
the
club-date
field,
we
will
for
purposes
of
our
case
before
your
honors
assume
as
judge
levet,
the
trial
judge
assumed
that
leaders
are
employers
because
we
believe
as
did
the
trial
judge
and
as
did
judge
friendly
in
his
dissent
that
there
is
no
antitrust
violation
here
regardless
of
whether
or
no
the
leaders
are
called
employers
whether
they're
called
independent
contractors
or
whether
they
are
called
what
we
would
call
them
working
musicians
who
perform
at
the
trade,
who
conduct,
who
play
instruments
and
that
is
the
critical
aspect
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
and
not
the
fact
that
they
might
be
called
employers
and
not
the
fact
that
they
might
be
called
independent
contractors.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
that
is
our
position
for
purposes
of
this
case
your
honor
that
the
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well,
we
are
--
we
are
prepared
to
concede
for
purposes
of
this
case
your
honor
that
the
leader
is
the
employer
because
we
believe
that
the
question
is
--
the
questions
presented
by
this
case
can
be
answered
regardless
of
the
status
of
the
leader
as
an
employer
or
as
an
employee.
the
same
fashion
as
judge
levet.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
that
varies
your
honor.
they
--
money
might
be
funneled
through
the
leader
to
the
sideman
and
--
or
in
some
circumstances
admittedly
rare
the
purchase
or
the
music
might
even
pay
directly.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
we
are
your
honor.
but
we
--
we
do
--
we
believe
basically
that
the
leader
is
not
in
fact
he
employer
but
your
honors,
do
not
have
before
them
a
record
sufficient
for
you
to
reach
that
particular
question
and
to
decide
ultimately
if
it's
critical
to
the
decision,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
leader
is
or
is
not
the
employer
because
judge
levet
who
heard
the
entire
case
assumed
as
we
are
now
assuming
that
the
leader
is
the
employer.
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
and
despite
the
fact
that
there
had
been
no
express
finding
on
this
particular
point,
concluded
that
the
leader
was
the
employer
in
the
club-date
field.
it's
our
position
as
it
was
judge
levet's
but
that
issue
was
not
controlling
here
but
if
it
were
--
if
in
your
honors
opinion
it
were
then
not
in
this
case
would
require
a
remand
so
that
the
trial
judge
who
heard
all
of
the
evidence
on
this
particular
issue
would
be
in
the
position
to
decide
the
initial
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
we
are
conceding,
yes
your
honor
that
they
are
the
employer
because
we
believe
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
i
believe
we
have
reserved
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
leader
is
the
employer
in
our
original
petition
and
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
we
are
not
conceding
it
if
it
--
if
it
affects
the
case
and
the
result
ultimately,
we
are
not
conceding
the
point.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
it
was
not
intended
as
a
concession
your
honor.
our
basic
position
is
that
the
point
is
in
material
to
the
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
in
this
case.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
certainly
not
our
contention
to
concede
the
point
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
make
the
point
to
describe
our
basic
argument
as
to
why
we
consider
this
point
quite
irrelevant
that
the
status
of
the
leader
is
insignificant
in
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
i
certainly
did
not
intend
to
concede
the
point
your
honor.
we
will
not
address
ourself
to
that
particular
point.
we
have
not
in
any
of
our
papers
to
this
court
ruin
into
that
point
at
any
great
length
because
of
our
basic
belief
that
a
case
can
be
answered
without
this
court
deciding
that
issue,
deciding
as
judge
levet
or
did
assume
that
the
leader
is
the
employer
that
the
issues
are
the
same
and
that
the
ultimate
conclusion
is
that
there
is
no
violation
of
the
antitrust
law
and
any
of
the
items
in
this
particular
complaint.
the
--
as
i
indicated
previously,
the
major
--
one
of
the
major
contentions
of
the
plaintiffs
throughout
has
been
that
the
union
violates
the
antitrust
laws
by
admitting
leaders
into
membership.
and
this
contention
was
advanced
despite
the
plaintiff's
own
stipulation
that
the
leaders
have
traditionally
for
at
least
65
years
been
members
of
the
union.
in
both
court's
below
found
that
in
fact,
that
in
the
commercial
or
non-club-date
engagements
where
there
formal
collective
bargaining
agreements
which
cover
the
leader
as
an
employee
that
the
leader
is
in
fact
the
employee.
both
courts
below
made
that
finding
in
the
non-club-date
field.
as
indicated,
the
trial
court
decided
it
unnecessary
to
his
decision
to
reach
a
conclusion
on
their
status
in
the
club-date
field.
thus
when
the
plaintiffs
asked
the
trial
court
to
bar
leaders,
the
unions
from
seeking
leaders
into
membership,
they
seek
to
obliterate
practices
which
this
union
follows
its
inception,
no
recent
practice,
no
recent
idea
of
the
type
occurred
to
the
people
involved
in
the
grease
peddlers
case
or
the
hinton
case
but
rather
the
membership
of
these
people
in
the
union
was
a
long
historical
practice
stemming
from
the
fact
that
they
are
working
musicians
that
when
they
conduct
and
when
they
play
instruments
at
these
engagements,
they
are
working
musicians.
now
the
trial
court
attempting
to
answer
the
questions
presented
by
the
complaint
stated
that
the
issue
before
him
had
to
be
resolved
on
the
basis
of
this
court's
decision
in
meat
drivers
versus
united
states.
but
the
question
before
him
was
whether
or
not
the
leaders
were
in
such
job
and
wage
competition
or
other
economic
relationship
that
the
union
had
a
legitimate
right
to
seek
and
to
take
these
people
into
membership.
and
he
concluded
on
the
basis
of
carefully
detailed
lengthy
findings
set
forth
in
this
appendix
that
the
leaders
when
they
conduct,
displace
a
sub-leader
from
a
job
when
they
play
an
instrument
as
they
almost
always
do,
they
displace
a
sideman
from
a
job
and
predicated
on
those
findings
of
job
displacement
by
the
leaders,
he
concluded
that
the
leaders
were
in
job
and
wage
competition
with
the
union's
other
employee
members
and
for
that
reason,
the
union
did
not
violate
the
antirust
laws
by
admitting
leaders
into
membership.
and
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
there
is
no
real
difference
your
honor
if
we
can
legitimately
and
lawfully
within
the
meaning
of
the
antitrust
has
admit
them,
we
can
also
attempt
to
compel
them
to
join.
i
think
that's
clear
under
the
decisions
in
apex
and
hutchinson
and
so
forth
that
the
question
is
whether
or
not
they
can
belong
and
not
whether
or
not
the
method
by
which
we
seek
to
obtain
them
whether
voluntarily
or
whether
they
join
through
some
sort
of
union
pressure.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
there
are
a
few
who
never
act
as
sideman.
the
â€“
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well,
the
â€“
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
--
before
present
â€“-
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
--
yes,
the
four
present
plaintiffs
were
found
to
be
persons
who
perform
as
leaders
all
of
the
time.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no,
i
believe
your
honor
that
--
well,
there
are
various
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
--
addressed
itself
to
the
club-date
field
and
to
the
so
called
hotel
steady
engagement
field,
lumping
those
--
lumping
those
two
together.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well,
the
basic
distinction
is
between
those
short
performances
of
a
strictly
casual
nature
which
occur
in
the
social
engagement
of
club-date
field.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well,
that's
the--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
there
are
various
union
terminologies
but
judge
levet
in
his
decision
divide
the
case
into
the
club-date
and
steady
--
and
hotel
steady
engagement
and
all
other
fields.
so
the
basic
division
that
was
reached
in
terms
of
the
employer
issue
was
on
the
club-date
and
hotel
steady
as
being
that
group
that
judge
levet
assumed
were
employers
and
the
other
group
which
we
have
called
the
non-club-date
field.
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
follow
that
particular
line
and
although
it
based
its
decision
on
the
employments,
they
just
primarily
on
the
existence
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
then
made
a
statement
along
the
findings
of
various
collective
bargaining
agreements
in
certain
areas,
all
of
which
would
be
in
what
we
call
the
non-club-date
field.
but
the
terminology
that
i'm
using
is
basically
addressed
to
the
terminology
that
judge
levet
had
used
in
his
original
decision
and
his
--
that
area
where
he
assumed
employer
status
which
is
club-date
and
hotel
steady
field.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes
your
honor.
in
our
opinion,
i
think
that
the
other
issue
is
where
the
leader
is
the
employee
as
the
court
of
appeals
found
and
as
the
trial
court
found
and
there
are
no
basic
antitrust
issues
involved.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
there
was
no
finding
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
there's
no
finding
that
the
leader
was
the
employer
in
any
of
these
fields.
in
fact,
there
was
an
express
finding
that
in
the
television
recording
and
the
so
called
other
commercial
and
non-club-date
fields
that
the
leader
was
not
the
employer.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
with
all
do
respect
your
honor,
the
people
that
you've
just
named
are
just
that.
they
are
named
bands
and
there
was
an
expressed
finding
by
the
trial
court,
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
do
not
belong
to
the
group
which
might
be
called
named
bands
and
these
--
the
people
that
we're
talking
about
might
lead
all
the
time
but
they
are
certainly
not
named
bands
and
there
is
an
unchallenged
finding
by
the
district
court
on
that
particular
proposition.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
that's
just
not
the
finding
your
honor,
the
finding
that
this
people
are
the
people
who
lead
all
the
time
and
that
is
all.
there
is
no
finding
that
they
are
named
bands
in
that
sense
and
all
of
the
criteria,
what
constitutes
a
name
band
or
set
out
in
the
trial
judges
opinion
and
he
concludes
from
that
that
these
people
don't
fit
that
category
that
they
don't
have
those
special
characteristics
which
would
make
one
a
leader
of
a
named
band.
but
that's
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
pardon
me.
in
terms
of
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
he
talks
about
it
primarily
in
terms
of
the
class
action
aspects
of
the
case
which
are
at
this
point
really
out
of
the
case.
he
was
attempting
to
answer
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
in
fact
something
of
a
class
action.
our
basic
point
is
that
the
antitrust
laws
are
not
violated
when
these
people
work
as
musicians.
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
quite
irrelevant
to
whether
they
lead
sometimes
or
whether
they
lead
all
the
time
or
whether
they
lead
just
half
of
the
time.
the
fact
is
that
when
they
lead
and
conduct
and
play
an
instrument,
they
are
job
threats
and
here
is
the
finding
that
the
court
of
appeals
--
there
are
job
threats
to
our
employee
members
and
that
gives
us
the
right
to
take
them
into
membership
and
it
gives
us
the
right
to
regulate
their
activities
in
an
effective
matter
and
it's
when
they
play,
it's
what
they
do
as
musicians
that
we're
talking
about
and
not
some
abstract
notion
of
their
status
as
employers
or
independent
contractors.
they
are
job
threats.
they
displace
working
musicians
â€“-
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
pardon
me?
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
they
are
job
threats
your
honor.
in
the
words
of
the
court
of
appeals,
they
are
job
threats
to
the
unions'
employee
members
because
they
take
jobs
away
from
the
instrumentalists,
the
sidemen.
they
take
jobs
away
from
the
sub-leaders.
and
what
we
are
tempted
--
what
we
attempt
to
do
and
we
have
always
attempted
to
do
is
to
assure
that
if
they
are
to
play
these
jobs,
they
will
play
these
jobs
on
a
fair
condition
that
they
will
not.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well
your
honor,
in
those
circumstances,
there
are
very,
very
few
people
like
that
but
they
you
know
--
really
would
not
be
in
our
opinion
leaders
in
the
sense
that
we
use
the
term.
they
would
be
what
we
call
booking
agents
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
unions'
interest
would
not
be
so
great
but
what
we're
talking
about
is.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no
your
honor.
our
primary
argument
is
based
upon
what
is
the
overwhelming
--
the
overwhelming
fact
that
these
people
do
when
they
lead
on
an
everyday
basis
that
they
are
performing
musicians
and
that
the
vast
number
of
the
situations
to
which
we're
--
with
which
the
union
is
concerned
are
the
what
we
would
call
the
performing
leader.
now,
there
are
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well
your
honor,
the
ladder
situation
where
the
particular
leader
is
not
performing
with
the
phrases,
a
non-performing
leader.
we
believe
that
that
particular
regulation
which
is
not
the
predominant
situation.
it's
a
miniscule
part
of
the
basic
picture.
in
that
particular
situation,
there's
a
quite
different
argument.
admittedly,
that
situation
is
far
more
difficult
for
our
purposes
in
terms
of
its
legitimacy
than
the
situation
of
the
--
with
the
performing
leader
where
the
man
actually
works
at
the
trade
where
people
can
see
him
so
to
speak
and
wavings
it's
baton
or
playing
its
instrument.
in
the
situation
where
he
doesn't
perform,
we
believe
that
the
facts
of
the
industry
and
as
the
trial
court
found,
show
that
there
is
so
direct
relationship
between
the
price
of
this
so
called
non-performing
leader
charges
and
the
amounts
that
the
sideman
will
receive
but
under
those
circumstances,
the
unions
regulation
of
a
price
is
legitimate
because
it
is
justice
white's
words,
a
matter
of
imminent
and
direct
concern.
but
that
is
a
quite
different
argument
your
honor
than
our
fundamental
argument
about
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
because
your
honor,
our
answer
there
is
tied
very
directly
to
the
special
circumstances
of
this
industry
is
found
by
the
trial
judge
and
that
is
the
kind
of
fluidity,
the
interchangeability
among
functions
in
this
particular
used
to
be
as
such
and
the
lack
of
any
capital
and
requirement
of
any
capital
investment
in
the
specific
findings
based
upon
the
evidence
that
where
the
leader
be
he
performing
or
not
performing
does
not
obtain
as
a
price
to
the
unions
minimum
the
sideman
won't
be
paid.
now
that's
a
very
unusual
situation.
that's
quite
unlike
the
situation
which
your
honor
attempted
to
said
out
about
an
automobile
where
the
union
can't
show
that
kind
of
direct
intimate
relationship,
a
one
on
one
relationship
so
to
speak
and
i
think
that
the
--
basically,
these
notions
are
non-performing
leaders
is
really
de
minimis
in
the
sense
that
it's
so
small
apart.
what
we're
talking
about
primarily
is
our
concern
about
the
performing
leader,
about
the
leader
when
he
conducts
and
when
he
plays
on
an
instrument.
that
is
the
fundamental
aspect
of
our
case
and
when
he
does
that
as
i
have
indicated,
he
is
in
job
and
wage
competition
with
the
unions'
sidemen
or
sub-leader
members.
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
both
courts
concluded
that
the
union
had
a
right
to
seek
the
leader
as
a
member
and
the
trial
court
on
the
basis
again
of
that
particular
finding,
on
the
findings
of
displacement
and
of
job
and
wage
competition,
concluded
that
the
union
had
a
right
not
only
to
take
them
into
membership
but
to
set
a
rate
for
them.
just
a
rate
comparable
to
the
rate
for
other
musicians
and
to
require
in
order
that
that
rate
maybe
received
that
it
will
actually
be
received
by
that
particular
musician
that
they
each
have
a
minimum
price
through
the
purchase
or
the
music.
now
the
reason
for
the
charge
of
the
price
is
that
where
the
leader
or
any
independent
contractor
or
employer
in
this
sense
is
to
receive
moneys
and
if
you
call
an
employer
who
receives
prices,
if
you
call
him
an
employee,
he
receives
wages
but
it's
the
same
money
for
doing
the
same
thing
and
what
the
union
must
do
as
it
did
in
oliver
is
to
assure
that
he
in
fact
receives
in
his
pocket,
the
leader
in
our
case
or
the
owner
operator
in
the
oliver
case
that
your
honors
decided,
receives
in
his
pocket
the
amount
that
the
union
has
set
for
the
wage
scale
and
as
in
oliver,
he
is
in
fact
charging
an
amount
for
a
truck
which
is
less
than
the
true
rate
for
that
particular
truck,
he
is
not
getting
the
wage
scale
because
the
difference
between
the
true
rental
of
the
truck
and
the
amount
that
he
has
received
must
be
subtracted
from
his
wage
scale.
and
so
if
the
leader
here
receives
something
less
than
his
total
contribution
for
the
performance,
he
is
not
getting
the
wage
scale
for
the
function
that
he
is
performing,
conducting
and
acting
as
an
instrumentalist
and
that
is
essentially
our
argument.
there
is
of
course
the
argument
quite
different
about
the
situation
of
when
the
leader
does
not
perform
and
there,
as
i
attempted
to
indicate
to
justice
fortas,
the
special
circumstances
of
this
industry
and
the
miniscule
amounts
involved
in
that
particular
case,
show
that
the
union
has
not
violated
the
antitrust
laws
in
that
particular
circumstance
as
well.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
basically
a
de
minimis
but
also
because
of
the
very
explicit
findings
of
a
direct
relationship
between
price
and
wages
here,
that
in
this
particular
industry,
the
union
has
found
and
the
evidence
supported
that
the
trial
judge
found
that
unless
the
leader
be
he
performing
or
not,
receives
that
amount.
he
won't
pay
the
--
he
won't
pay
the
wages.
we're
dealing
with
a
very
special
kind
of
industry.
there
is
no
capital
requirement.
people
are
at
one
moment
leaders
and
the
next
moment
sidemen.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
the
phrase
non-performing
leader
your
honor
does
not
concern
the
one
who
waves
the
baton
conducting
was
stipulated
to
be
a
musical
function.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
and
that
--
so
that
when
a
leader
conducts,
he
is
a
performing
leader
in
the
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
non-performing
leader
is
the
one
in
the
situation
i
attempted
to
describe
where
a
man
gets
two
or
three
engagements
on
the
same
night
and
he
â€“
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
--
he
gets
someone
else
to
act
as
a
sub-leader
â€“
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well,
that
is
precisely
in
that
context.
the
union
is
looking
generally
to
the
man
who
sets
it
up
to
be
there
and
do
the
conducting
and
then
they
are
these
chance
situations
in
which
you
have
a
sub-leader
used
and
which
he
is
a
non-performing
leader.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
that's
a
quite
limited
amount
your
honor.
it's
a
minimum.
the
union
sets
a
minimum
price
which
is
the
scale
for
the
leader
himself,
for
the
function
he
is
performing
as
a
conductor
and
as
an
instrumentalist
plus
the
wage
of
the
sideman,
plus
an
amount
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
8%
which
was
stipulated
--
which
astounded
the
amount
necessary
for
various
income
tax
or
social
security
withholding.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
that's
correct
your
honor
under
the
social
security
regulations
he
is
responsible
for
that
particular
withholding,
so
that
we
have
three
basic
components
in
the
minimum
that
the
union
has
set.
each
of
this
is
an
amount
which
he
must
put
in
the
minimum
price
to
the
purchaser
of
the
music.
and
the
reason
that
these
are
included
is
to
assure
if
he
were
obligated
to
make
a
--
make
social
security
payments
of
a
certain
amount.
and
in
fact,
he
charges
a
minimum
price,
less
than
the
amount
of
his
own
scale
plus
that
withholding
amount.
he
would
in
fact
be
working
at
an
amount
less
than
the
union
scale
for
that
particular
job.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well
i
believe
your
honor,
that's
in
case
310.
the
plaintiffs
have
attempted
to
bring
that
point
up.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
the
territorial
restriction
is
strictly
a
term
and
condition
of
employment
that
involves
a
labor
dispute
within
the
meaning
of
section
13.
in
that
particular
aspect
as
the
trial
judge
pointed
out,
we're
strictly
dealing
with
the
question
of
what
a
union
may
do
in
order
to
obtain
benefits
for
its
members.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
basically
your
honor.
the
regulations
themselves
are
primarily
an
increase
in
scale.
a
new
york
musician
when
he
comes
down
in
washington
will
receive
--
it
is
required
by
union
regulations
to
receive
an
additional
amount
as
wages
10%.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no,
he
can
play.
there
are
certain
circumstances
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes
your
honor.
there
are
certain
circumstances
in
which
if
in
washington
on
a
long-term
engagement,
he
might
not
be
able
to
compete
and
these
are
on
certain
types
of
local
engagements
and
basically,
he
may
go
outside
and
they
do
all
the
time.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
the
union
regulations
your
honor,
indicated
union
and
the
leaders
have
agreed
that
all
of
these
regulations
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes
you
honor
because
of
the
finding
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
because
this
is
not
the
kind
of
combination
that
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
we
are
relying
--
i'm
really
on
the
exemption
because
there's
no
combination
with
any
non-labor
group.
the
reason
that
the
leaders
are
in
the
union
is
because
of
the
job
and
wage
competition
which
make
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
because
it's
part
of
the
wages
your
honor
and
when
they
work
on
the
road
like
any
other
musician,
they
are
to
receive
additional
wages
because
--
they're
working
musicians.
when
they
go
on
the
road,
they
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well,
the
answer
there
your
honor
is
that
the
so
called
booking
agents
are
â€“-
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
pardon
me?
yes
they
are.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes
your
honor.
that
certainly
does
not
violate
the
antitrust
laws.
what
we're
seeking
in
that
circumstance
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
your
honor
on
that
particular
point,
as
you
know
the
court
of
appeals
found
a
total
lack
of
standing
and
here
--
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
issue
was
presented
in
the
plaintiff's
certiorari
petition
but
here
again,
there
is
a
relationship.
all
that
the
union
has
done
here
will
say
to
its
members,
don't
accept
kick
backs
from
a
given
group.
there
is
no
combination
with
caterers.
there's
no
agreement
with
caterers,
the
union's
own
internal
regulations.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes
there
is
by
the
terms
of
the
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
as
i
understand
your
honor,
we're
charged
with
price
fixing
that
the
union
by
setting
a
minimum
amount
for
each
that
the
leader
must
charge
on
what
we
call
the
purchase
of
the
music
on
each
particular
engagement
hasn't
engaged
in
price
fixing.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
that
the
union
is
engaged
in
price
fixing
by
setting
this
forth
in
a
union
regulation
which
is
adhered
to
by
certain
union
members
called
leaders
and
that
in
that
sense,
the
union
has
agreed
on
a
price.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
this
is
a
minimum
of
course
your
honor.
it's
a
minimum
which
reflects
only
the
sidemen
scale,
the
performing
instrumentalist
scale
as
in
writing
and
the
minimum
for
the
leader
himself
who
was
a
working
musician.
that's
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
that's
when
the
union
and
the
so
called
--
its
own
members.
that's
part
of
the
difficulty
in
this
case
your
honor
that
the
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
its
own
members,
yes.
so
called
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no.
the
union
regulations
can't
reach
anyone
who
is
not
a
member.
the
--
this
is
all
done
by
internal
union
regulation.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
pardon
me?
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well,
there
are
no
such
agreements
your
honor.
we
just
don't
reach
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
basically
your
honor
that
the
--
because
they
are
members
and
they
have
become
members
legitimately.
there's
a
charge
that
they
are
improperly
members
of
the
union
and
both
courts
rejected
that
because
of
the
finding
that
they
are
properly
members
of
the
union
based
upon
the
fact
that
they
compete
with
our
--
with
other
members
of
the
union,
we
say
that
we
have
a
right
to
regulate
them
like
any
other
members.
they
are
properly
members
and
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
they
raise
various
other
issues
your
honor
which
were
disposed
of
in
our
favor
by
both
courts
below.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well,
as
i
understand,
that
is
basically
their
contention.
as
i
understand
it,
there
are
a
lots
of
other
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well,
they
also
your
honor
as
i
understand
their
complaint
--
complain
that
we
reach
agreements
with
other
--
with
other
people
like
nightclubs
and
booking
agents
and
hotel
--
but
in
those
--
with
regards
to
the
nightclubs
and
the
recording
company,
there
is
an
expressed
finding
that
those
come
--
we
do
not
said
any
price
in
that
circumstance
number
one,
the
--
and
the
finding
was
that
these
other
people
are
employers
and
not
the
leaders
so
that
the
leader
has
lost
even
the
--
even
the
possibility
of
being
the
independent
employer
businessmen
in
those
situations
where
we
have
agreements.
he
is
not
because
of
the
nature
of
his
job
function
or
other
things.
he
is
not
the
employer
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well,
he
say,
they
admit
that
he
is
a
member
of
the
union.
they
think
that
he
is
improperly
a
member
of
the
union
and
they
argue
that
no
leader
should
be
a
member
of
the
union.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
what
club-date-field.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
in
what
we
call
the
club-date
field.
and
that
field
alone
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
that
would
be
outside
in
terms
of
labors
exemption
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no,
not
nearly
by
joining
the
union
but
by
belonging
to
a
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no.
it's
not
the
joining
of
the
union
your
honor.
it's
the
existence
of
job
and
wage
competition
with
the
union's
employee
members.
it's
the
threat
that
these
people
present
to
the
union,
to
the
sidemen
who
are
admitted
employee.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
that
of
course
was
not
the
situation
before
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
i
would
say
that
that's
a
violation
but
because
you
have
the
critical
element
the
fact
that
the
union's
regulation
is
predicated
upon
the
existence
of
job
and
wage
competition.
the
competition
with
the
employee
members
and
that
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
oh
yes,
certainly
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
we
would
have
the
right
to
seek
and
to
have
them
do
this,
yes,
but
because
they
are
in
job
and
wage
competition.
your
honors,
this
is
really
precisely
what
was
involved
in
the
oliver
case
that
particular
line
of
analysis
because
in
oliver,
there
was
no
indication
that
the
owner
operators
were
members
of
the
union
and
yet
the
union
was
setting
a
price
that
the
owner
operator
was
to
charge
back
to
the
â€“
of
the
truck.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no
but
we
did
by
an
agreement
with
him
to
determine
what
another
independent
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
but
we
do
not
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
what
we
did
in
that
particular
instance,
the
union
was
setting
the
sales
price
of
the
owner
operator
because
it
was
reaching
the
price
of
the
truck.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
i
believe
it's
precisely
what
we're
doing
here
your
honor.
we're
setting
an
amount
that
as
a
minimum
which
is
intended
to
assure
that
the
leader
receive
the
amount
that
he
gets
for
working
as
a
performing
musician.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
the
answer
is,
where
the
man
is
coming
himself
working
as
an
electrician,
taking
work
away
that
the
union
if
it's
necessary
can
set
a
minimum
price
which
will
assure
that
the
man
will
receive
in
his
own
pocket
the
minimum
wage
that
the
union
set
for
that
type
of
work.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes
your
honor.
the
oliver
case
makes
clear--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
analytically
your
honor,
it
makes
clear
that
where
the
union
is
attempting
to
set
a
price
in
order
to
assure
that
the
wage
scale
is
not
subverted
then
that
is
not
a
constitute
of
violation
of
the
antitrust
law.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
pardon
me?
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
thank
you.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no
your
honor,
the
allen
bradley
case
to
which
you're
referring
involved
a
conspiracy
in
which
a
union
came
to
the
aid
of
already
existing
conspiracy.
both
courts
below
here
rejected
the
notion
that
out
of
this
case
approached
the
allen
bradley
posture.
they
both
rejected
the
notion
that
there
was
a
conspiracy.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
but
only
through
a
very
indirect
fashion
and
only
through
creating
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no,
i
think
that
justice
fortas
made
it
in
quite
a
direct
situation
where
the
electrician
is
in
fact
working
on
the
job
and
on
those
circumstances
in
that
limited
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
certainly
not
your
honor.
the
essential
element
here
is
the
fact
that
these
people
are
working
at
the
trade
and
there
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
our
regulations
are
limited
to
those
situations
when
he
is
working
at
the
trade
and
we
do
what
is
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
if
he
is
in
job
and
wage
competition,
he
may
legitimately
be
sought
as
a
member
of
the
union.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no.
that
was
involved
under
wisconsin's
little
norris-laguardia
act.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no
sir,
your
honor.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
in
my
opponent's
argument,
there
are
many,
many
statements
made
about
lots
of
things
that
the
musician's
union
does
lots
of
statements
about
the
nature
of
various
negotiations.
none
of
these
things
are
in
the
record
and
none
of
them
are
the
facts
as
they
exist.
the
facts
are
as
found
by
the
district
judge
and
as
confirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
your
honors,
i
have
before
you
a
distillation
of
a
lengthy
trial
in
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
an
apt
description
of
what
occurs
in
this
particular
industry.
and
the
argument
that
you've
heard
today
has
very
little
to
do
in
fact
with
that
particular
industry.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
do
we
challenge
any
of
the
findings?
no,
your
honor.
there
are
--
there
is
one
or
two
little
matters
of
--
very
small
concern,
but
nothing
of
a
fundamental
nature.
their
--
in
my
opponent's
presentation
today,
he
made
the
statement,
and
i
think
this
really
lies
at
the
heart
of
our
case,
your
honors,
that
the
sub-leader
stands
in
the
place
of
the
leader.
now,
there
was
a
stipulation
that
the
sub-leader
is
an
employee.
there
was
also
a
stipulation
that
the
sideman
is
an
employee.
now,
when
this
--
when
the
sub-leader
stands
in
the
place
of
the
leader,
when
he
performs
precisely
the
same
work
function,
then
there
is
such
danger
to
the
wage
standards
of
the
sub-leaders
and
of
the
sidemen
musicians
when
the
leader
is
permitted
to
form
--
perform
in
an
unregulated
fashion
that
the
union
has
the
right
to
reach
that
particular
type
of
disruption
of
its
wage
standards,
and
that
is
the
basis
of
our
reliance
upon
oliver
and
of
our
reliance
upon
jewell
t.
and
this
court's
expressed
recognition
in
jewell
t.
that
there
are
times
when
the
--
that
it's
not
the
form
of
the
--
of
the
agreement
that
is
critical.
it's
the
impact
of
the
agreement.
and
here,
the
impact
of
the
union's
regulations
upon
the
leader
is
to
preserve
the
wage
standards
of
the
employees,
the
stipulated
employees
on
this
record,
the
sidemen
and
the
sub-leaders,
these
--
this
was
stipulated
that
these
people
are
employees
and
the
critical
aspect
of
the
union's
regulation
is
an
attempt
to
preserve
those
wage
standards
against
diminution
by
a
leader
who
works
at
an
amount
less
than
that.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
because
the
â€“
just
as
the
union
has
the
right
to
say
when
a
musician
plays
two
instruments,
he
will
receive
a
certain
amount
more.
in
those
fields
in
which
the
leader
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
because
typically
in
this
field,
and
it
was
stipulated,
your
honor,
that
in
those
fields
in
which
the
leader
is
admittedly
an
employee
under
the
findings
of
both
courts
below,
the
--
so
the
recording
in
television,
the
leader
always
receives
a
--
an
amount
two
times.
he
always
receive
twice
the
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
that's
no
different
than
the
union
is
saying,
is
it
does,
your
honor,
that
the
--
a
musician
who
performs
on
two
instruments
shall
receive
and
additional
amount.
the
leader
in
playing
an
instrument
and
conducting
is
performing
on
the
job,
essentially
two
types
of
job.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
in
that
particular
circumstance,
your
honor,
he
does
not
receive
two
times.
he
receives
in
the
end
for
himself
only
25%
because
the
sub-leader
gets
the
main
--
gets
half
of
that
additional
amount
under
those
circumstances.
the
leader,
when
he
does
not
perform,
does
not
receive
a
full
amount.
he
in
fact
turns
to
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
because
for
a
number
of
reasons,
your
honor.
number
one,
the
reason
that
judge
friendly
has
signed
is
because
that
is
very
much
a
part
of
the
musical
engagement,
and
this
is
essentially
a
musical
function.
the
major
argument,
your
honor,
which
is
quite
different
in
our
--
than
our
argument
about
whether
a
leader
performs,
is
that
because
of
the
special
nature
of
this
industry
and
as
found
by
the
trial
court
that
in
this
particular
industry,
wages
suffer
when
the
price
does
not
meet
the
minimum
wage
of
the
--
the
minimum
wage
scales
that
the
union
has
set
forth.
we're
not
attempting
to
get
an
increase
in
wages
or
anything
like
that.
what
we're
talking
about
is
in
this
particular
industry,
as
the
trial
judge
found,
there's
a
direct
relationship
and
that
wages
do
suffer.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
not
really.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
if
there
were
--
if
there
were
findings
for
the
type
that
were
made
here
showing
that
there
is
--
that
there
is
scrimping,
where
there's
scrimping
that
the
wages
suffer,
than
in
that
particular
circumstance
a
very
narrow
situation--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
if
you
had
that
kind
of
a
record,
your
honor.
now,
that's
very
unusual,
and
what
happens
is
the
very
unusualness
of
this
industry
and
the
union's
experiences
as
found
by
the
trial
judge
are
the
justification
which
we
point
to
on
this
--
on
this
narrow
instance
where
the
leader
does
not
perform.
and
the
other
situation,
the
matter
is
much
clearer.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
thank
you.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
your
honors
on
cross
petitions
for
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit.
in
case
309,
the
american
federation
of
musicians
and
its
logo
late
02
seek
reversal
of
the
court
of
appeals
holding
to
which
judge
friendly
had
decided
that
certain
of
the
unions
regulations
constitute
price
fixing
and
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
in
case
number
310,
the
plaintiffs
four
professional
musicians
challenged
the
circuit
court's
unanimous
decision
that
a
host
of
other
practices
which
they
had
challenged
and
which
the
district
court
had
dismissed,
did
not
constitute
--
did
not
constitute
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws.
the
plaintiffs
had
raised
an
entire
series
of
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws
which
both
courts
below
categorized
into
set
--
eight
separate
categories
but
it
is
to
the
allegation
that
the
unions
violated
the
antitrust
laws,
the
predicate
of
the
majority
opinion
of
the
second
circuit
and
to
the
contention
that
the
unions
violate
the
antitrust
laws
by
accepting
so
called
orchestra
leaders
into
membership
that
i
will
address
to
my
remarks
primarily.
the
second
point
that
the
unions
violate
the
antitrust
laws
by
seeking
and
even
coercing
orchestra
leaders
into
membership,
i
will
address
myself
to
my
opening
remarks
because
in
our
view,
it
sheds
light
on
the
basic
contention
in
case
number
309,
the
price
fixing
charge
and
indeed
in
our
opinion,
the
answer
to
the
question
is
to
whether
or
not
the
union
may
admit
the
so
called
orchestra
leaders
into
membership
is
in
fact
conclusive
analytically
under
this
court's
decision
of
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
unions
may
legitimately
set
a
minimum
price
for
the
total
contribution
that
the
orchestra
leader
makes
to
the
so
called
purchase
or
the
music.
following
a
five
week
trial
on
this
entire
case
involving
myriad
of
issues,
judge
levet
who
had
had
a
certain
special
familiarity
with
the
industry,
with
the
practices
of
the
american
federation
of
musicians
due
to
a
length
of
this
particular
trial
and
to
his
participation
in
other
earlier
litigation
between
these
two
parties,
dismissed
the
complaints
in
their
entirety.
his
opinion
which
has
contained
of
course
in
the
record
contains
comprehensive
findings
of
fact
which
are
meticulously
annotated
to
the
lengthy
record
of
this
case.
and
he
as
i
have
indicated
dismissed
the
complaints
in
their
entirety.
we
rely
very
heavily
your
honors
upon
the
careful
findings
of
fact
that
the
trial
judge
made
in
this
case.
indeed,
these
findings
of
fact
lay
at
the
heart
of
this
case
and
in
the
findings
of
job
and
wage
competition
as
i
shall
attempt
to
show
to
you
your
honors
in
fact
or
conclusive
of
the
legitimacy
of
the
unions'
contentions
in
this
case.
although
the
plaintiff's
here
in
case
310
attack
the
unions'
regulations
and
so
far
as
they
pertain
in
all
fields
of
musical
endeavor,
both
courts
below
considered
that
the
primary
--
indeed
the
main
attack
concern
the
so
called
club-date
field
which
was
by
stipulation
said
to
be
single
engagements
concerning
social
affairs
such
as
bar
mitzvahs
or
weddings
and
other
comparable
social
events.
the
plaintiffs
in
fact
in
this
case,
the
four
remaining
plaintiffs
do
perform
and
there
is
a
finding
to
the
effect
that
they
perform
primarily
in
the
club-date
field.
the
so
called
non-club-date
field
would
include
theatrical
engagements,
opera
recordings,
nightclub
acts,
and
engagements
of
that
type.
the
club-date
field
again
is
single
engagements
concerning
social
affairs.
now,
in
order
to
understand
the
nature
of
this
particular
field
and
the
manner
which
these
particular
engagements
come
about,
it
might
be
helpful
to
describe
the
--
some
of
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
as
regards
the
method
by
which
a
so
called
club-date
comes
about.
normally,
the
purchaser
of
the
music,
the
sponsor
of
the
social
affair
will
approach
a
given
musician.
you
might
have
met
that
musician
before,
seen
them
in
the
previous
engagement
or
he
might
even
be
a
relative.
in
some
circumstances
where
the
fact
that
a
given
engagement
is
to
come
about
that
there
is
to
be
a
bar
mitzvah
that
there
is
to
be
a
wedding
is
known
the
musician
will
approach
the
sponsor
of
the
activity
himself
seeking
the
engagement.
now,
when
the
sponsor
of
the
engagement
in
the
pawns
of
the
trade,
the
purchase
of
the
music
engages
that
particular
musician
and
to
obtain
to
play
that
engagement
and
to
obtain
the
other
musicians
who
will
play,
that
leader
by
that
act
becomes
the
leader
for
the
engagement
and
he
then
undertakes
the
responsibility
of
playing
that
engagement,
obtaining
the
other
musicians
who
will
play
who
are
called
sidemen,
straight
instrumentalists.
now
the
particular
musician
who
has
assumed
the
responsibility
of
leader
might
be
acting
his
particular
time
for
a
leader
for
the
first
time
of
his
life,
for
the
hundredth
time
in
his
life,
he
might
--
the
very
afternoon
on
which
he
is
to
play
as
a
leader
that
evening,
perform
as
a
sidemen.
the
fluidity
and
the
interchangeability
of
functions
in
this
field
as
outlined
in
the
record
and
is
in
the
findings
of
fact
is
considerable.
musicians
perform
in
many
fields.
they
perform
in
the
club-date
field,
the
non-club-date
field.
they
are
sometimes
leader
and
sometimes
sidemen.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes
your
honor.
on
each
engagement,
there
will
be
someone
performing
the
leaders
function.
now
at
--
in
response
really
to
what
justice
harlan
has
just
said,
at
each
engagement,
there
will
be
a
person
who
will
perform
the
conducting
function
and
that
is
the
leader's
function,
the
obligation
to
conduct.
now
the
leader
will
also
and
almost
instances
playing
instrument
as
well
as
conduct.
the
sidemen
of
course
as
instrumentalist
do
playing
â€“
play
an
instrument.
now
there
are
occasions
in
this
field
in
which
the
particular
leader
in
question
might
have
two
or
more
engagements
on
the
same
night.
and
under
those
circumstances,
he
will
obtain
what
is
called
a
sub-leader
to
perform
the
leading
function,
to
do
the
conducting
at
that
particular
engagement.
so
that
in
essence,
there
are
the
sidemen
who
perform
as
instrumentalist,
the
sub-leader
who
both
conduct
and
generally
will
play
an
instrument
and
the
leader
who
will
conduct
if
he
is
present
to
a
particular
engagement
and
will
generally
play
an
instrument
as
well.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes.
that
is
the
--
the
person
who
does
the
obtaining
is
a
leader
but
the
conducting
function
might
be
performed
either
by
the
leader
or
by
a
sub-leader.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
the
conducting
function?
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well,
there
are
--
there
are
conceivable
occasions
on
which
the
person
is
obtaining
will
not
in
fact
perform
the
conducting
function
but
that
is
the
rarity
and
i
was
attempting
to
describe
the
basic
pattern.
now,
although
the
unions
contended
that
the
original
trial
of
the
case
that
the
leaders
in
this
circumstances
are
not
employers
in
the
club-date
field,
we
will
for
purposes
of
our
case
before
your
honors
assume
as
judge
levet,
the
trial
judge
assumed
that
leaders
are
employers
because
we
believe
as
did
the
trial
judge
and
as
did
judge
friendly
in
his
dissent
that
there
is
no
antitrust
violation
here
regardless
of
whether
or
no
the
leaders
are
called
employers
whether
they're
called
independent
contractors
or
whether
they
are
called
what
we
would
call
them
working
musicians
who
perform
at
the
trade,
who
conduct,
who
play
instruments
and
that
is
the
critical
aspect
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
and
not
the
fact
that
they
might
be
called
employers
and
not
the
fact
that
they
might
be
called
independent
contractors.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
that
is
our
position
for
purposes
of
this
case
your
honor
that
the
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well,
we
are
--
we
are
prepared
to
concede
for
purposes
of
this
case
your
honor
that
the
leader
is
the
employer
because
we
believe
that
the
question
is
--
the
questions
presented
by
this
case
can
be
answered
regardless
of
the
status
of
the
leader
as
an
employer
or
as
an
employee.
the
same
fashion
as
judge
levet.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
that
varies
your
honor.
they
--
money
might
be
funneled
through
the
leader
to
the
sideman
and
--
or
in
some
circumstances
admittedly
rare
the
purchase
or
the
music
might
even
pay
directly.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
we
are
your
honor.
but
we
--
we
do
--
we
believe
basically
that
the
leader
is
not
in
fact
he
employer
but
your
honors,
do
not
have
before
them
a
record
sufficient
for
you
to
reach
that
particular
question
and
to
decide
ultimately
if
it's
critical
to
the
decision,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
leader
is
or
is
not
the
employer
because
judge
levet
who
heard
the
entire
case
assumed
as
we
are
now
assuming
that
the
leader
is
the
employer.
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
and
despite
the
fact
that
there
had
been
no
express
finding
on
this
particular
point,
concluded
that
the
leader
was
the
employer
in
the
club-date
field.
it's
our
position
as
it
was
judge
levet's
but
that
issue
was
not
controlling
here
but
if
it
were
--
if
in
your
honors
opinion
it
were
then
not
in
this
case
would
require
a
remand
so
that
the
trial
judge
who
heard
all
of
the
evidence
on
this
particular
issue
would
be
in
the
position
to
decide
the
initial
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
we
are
conceding,
yes
your
honor
that
they
are
the
employer
because
we
believe
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
i
believe
we
have
reserved
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
leader
is
the
employer
in
our
original
petition
and
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
we
are
not
conceding
it
if
it
--
if
it
affects
the
case
and
the
result
ultimately,
we
are
not
conceding
the
point.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
it
was
not
intended
as
a
concession
your
honor.
our
basic
position
is
that
the
point
is
in
material
to
the
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
in
this
case.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
certainly
not
our
contention
to
concede
the
point
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
make
the
point
to
describe
our
basic
argument
as
to
why
we
consider
this
point
quite
irrelevant
that
the
status
of
the
leader
is
insignificant
in
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
i
certainly
did
not
intend
to
concede
the
point
your
honor.
we
will
not
address
ourself
to
that
particular
point.
we
have
not
in
any
of
our
papers
to
this
court
ruin
into
that
point
at
any
great
length
because
of
our
basic
belief
that
a
case
can
be
answered
without
this
court
deciding
that
issue,
deciding
as
judge
levet
or
did
assume
that
the
leader
is
the
employer
that
the
issues
are
the
same
and
that
the
ultimate
conclusion
is
that
there
is
no
violation
of
the
antitrust
law
and
any
of
the
items
in
this
particular
complaint.
the
--
as
i
indicated
previously,
the
major
--
one
of
the
major
contentions
of
the
plaintiffs
throughout
has
been
that
the
union
violates
the
antitrust
laws
by
admitting
leaders
into
membership.
and
this
contention
was
advanced
despite
the
plaintiff's
own
stipulation
that
the
leaders
have
traditionally
for
at
least
65
years
been
members
of
the
union.
in
both
court's
below
found
that
in
fact,
that
in
the
commercial
or
non-club-date
engagements
where
there
formal
collective
bargaining
agreements
which
cover
the
leader
as
an
employee
that
the
leader
is
in
fact
the
employee.
both
courts
below
made
that
finding
in
the
non-club-date
field.
as
indicated,
the
trial
court
decided
it
unnecessary
to
his
decision
to
reach
a
conclusion
on
their
status
in
the
club-date
field.
thus
when
the
plaintiffs
asked
the
trial
court
to
bar
leaders,
the
unions
from
seeking
leaders
into
membership,
they
seek
to
obliterate
practices
which
this
union
follows
its
inception,
no
recent
practice,
no
recent
idea
of
the
type
occurred
to
the
people
involved
in
the
grease
peddlers
case
or
the
hinton
case
but
rather
the
membership
of
these
people
in
the
union
was
a
long
historical
practice
stemming
from
the
fact
that
they
are
working
musicians
that
when
they
conduct
and
when
they
play
instruments
at
these
engagements,
they
are
working
musicians.
now
the
trial
court
attempting
to
answer
the
questions
presented
by
the
complaint
stated
that
the
issue
before
him
had
to
be
resolved
on
the
basis
of
this
court's
decision
in
meat
drivers
versus
united
states.
but
the
question
before
him
was
whether
or
not
the
leaders
were
in
such
job
and
wage
competition
or
other
economic
relationship
that
the
union
had
a
legitimate
right
to
seek
and
to
take
these
people
into
membership.
and
he
concluded
on
the
basis
of
carefully
detailed
lengthy
findings
set
forth
in
this
appendix
that
the
leaders
when
they
conduct,
displace
a
sub-leader
from
a
job
when
they
play
an
instrument
as
they
almost
always
do,
they
displace
a
sideman
from
a
job
and
predicated
on
those
findings
of
job
displacement
by
the
leaders,
he
concluded
that
the
leaders
were
in
job
and
wage
competition
with
the
union's
other
employee
members
and
for
that
reason,
the
union
did
not
violate
the
antirust
laws
by
admitting
leaders
into
membership.
and
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
there
is
no
real
difference
your
honor
if
we
can
legitimately
and
lawfully
within
the
meaning
of
the
antitrust
has
admit
them,
we
can
also
attempt
to
compel
them
to
join.
i
think
that's
clear
under
the
decisions
in
apex
and
hutchinson
and
so
forth
that
the
question
is
whether
or
not
they
can
belong
and
not
whether
or
not
the
method
by
which
we
seek
to
obtain
them
whether
voluntarily
or
whether
they
join
through
some
sort
of
union
pressure.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
there
are
a
few
who
never
act
as
sideman.
the
â€“
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well,
the
â€“
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
--
before
present
â€“-
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
--
yes,
the
four
present
plaintiffs
were
found
to
be
persons
who
perform
as
leaders
all
of
the
time.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no,
i
believe
your
honor
that
--
well,
there
are
various
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
--
addressed
itself
to
the
club-date
field
and
to
the
so
called
hotel
steady
engagement
field,
lumping
those
--
lumping
those
two
together.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well,
the
basic
distinction
is
between
those
short
performances
of
a
strictly
casual
nature
which
occur
in
the
social
engagement
of
club-date
field.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well,
that's
the--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
there
are
various
union
terminologies
but
judge
levet
in
his
decision
divide
the
case
into
the
club-date
and
steady
--
and
hotel
steady
engagement
and
all
other
fields.
so
the
basic
division
that
was
reached
in
terms
of
the
employer
issue
was
on
the
club-date
and
hotel
steady
as
being
that
group
that
judge
levet
assumed
were
employers
and
the
other
group
which
we
have
called
the
non-club-date
field.
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
follow
that
particular
line
and
although
it
based
its
decision
on
the
employments,
they
just
primarily
on
the
existence
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
then
made
a
statement
along
the
findings
of
various
collective
bargaining
agreements
in
certain
areas,
all
of
which
would
be
in
what
we
call
the
non-club-date
field.
but
the
terminology
that
i'm
using
is
basically
addressed
to
the
terminology
that
judge
levet
had
used
in
his
original
decision
and
his
--
that
area
where
he
assumed
employer
status
which
is
club-date
and
hotel
steady
field.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes
your
honor.
in
our
opinion,
i
think
that
the
other
issue
is
where
the
leader
is
the
employee
as
the
court
of
appeals
found
and
as
the
trial
court
found
and
there
are
no
basic
antitrust
issues
involved.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
there
was
no
finding
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
there's
no
finding
that
the
leader
was
the
employer
in
any
of
these
fields.
in
fact,
there
was
an
express
finding
that
in
the
television
recording
and
the
so
called
other
commercial
and
non-club-date
fields
that
the
leader
was
not
the
employer.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
with
all
do
respect
your
honor,
the
people
that
you've
just
named
are
just
that.
they
are
named
bands
and
there
was
an
expressed
finding
by
the
trial
court,
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
do
not
belong
to
the
group
which
might
be
called
named
bands
and
these
--
the
people
that
we're
talking
about
might
lead
all
the
time
but
they
are
certainly
not
named
bands
and
there
is
an
unchallenged
finding
by
the
district
court
on
that
particular
proposition.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
that's
just
not
the
finding
your
honor,
the
finding
that
this
people
are
the
people
who
lead
all
the
time
and
that
is
all.
there
is
no
finding
that
they
are
named
bands
in
that
sense
and
all
of
the
criteria,
what
constitutes
a
name
band
or
set
out
in
the
trial
judges
opinion
and
he
concludes
from
that
that
these
people
don't
fit
that
category
that
they
don't
have
those
special
characteristics
which
would
make
one
a
leader
of
a
named
band.
but
that's
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
pardon
me.
in
terms
of
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
he
talks
about
it
primarily
in
terms
of
the
class
action
aspects
of
the
case
which
are
at
this
point
really
out
of
the
case.
he
was
attempting
to
answer
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
in
fact
something
of
a
class
action.
our
basic
point
is
that
the
antitrust
laws
are
not
violated
when
these
people
work
as
musicians.
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
quite
irrelevant
to
whether
they
lead
sometimes
or
whether
they
lead
all
the
time
or
whether
they
lead
just
half
of
the
time.
the
fact
is
that
when
they
lead
and
conduct
and
play
an
instrument,
they
are
job
threats
and
here
is
the
finding
that
the
court
of
appeals
--
there
are
job
threats
to
our
employee
members
and
that
gives
us
the
right
to
take
them
into
membership
and
it
gives
us
the
right
to
regulate
their
activities
in
an
effective
matter
and
it's
when
they
play,
it's
what
they
do
as
musicians
that
we're
talking
about
and
not
some
abstract
notion
of
their
status
as
employers
or
independent
contractors.
they
are
job
threats.
they
displace
working
musicians
â€“-
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
pardon
me?
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
they
are
job
threats
your
honor.
in
the
words
of
the
court
of
appeals,
they
are
job
threats
to
the
unions'
employee
members
because
they
take
jobs
away
from
the
instrumentalists,
the
sidemen.
they
take
jobs
away
from
the
sub-leaders.
and
what
we
are
tempted
--
what
we
attempt
to
do
and
we
have
always
attempted
to
do
is
to
assure
that
if
they
are
to
play
these
jobs,
they
will
play
these
jobs
on
a
fair
condition
that
they
will
not.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well
your
honor,
in
those
circumstances,
there
are
very,
very
few
people
like
that
but
they
you
know
--
really
would
not
be
in
our
opinion
leaders
in
the
sense
that
we
use
the
term.
they
would
be
what
we
call
booking
agents
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
unions'
interest
would
not
be
so
great
but
what
we're
talking
about
is.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no
your
honor.
our
primary
argument
is
based
upon
what
is
the
overwhelming
--
the
overwhelming
fact
that
these
people
do
when
they
lead
on
an
everyday
basis
that
they
are
performing
musicians
and
that
the
vast
number
of
the
situations
to
which
we're
--
with
which
the
union
is
concerned
are
the
what
we
would
call
the
performing
leader.
now,
there
are
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well
your
honor,
the
ladder
situation
where
the
particular
leader
is
not
performing
with
the
phrases,
a
non-performing
leader.
we
believe
that
that
particular
regulation
which
is
not
the
predominant
situation.
it's
a
miniscule
part
of
the
basic
picture.
in
that
particular
situation,
there's
a
quite
different
argument.
admittedly,
that
situation
is
far
more
difficult
for
our
purposes
in
terms
of
its
legitimacy
than
the
situation
of
the
--
with
the
performing
leader
where
the
man
actually
works
at
the
trade
where
people
can
see
him
so
to
speak
and
wavings
it's
baton
or
playing
its
instrument.
in
the
situation
where
he
doesn't
perform,
we
believe
that
the
facts
of
the
industry
and
as
the
trial
court
found,
show
that
there
is
so
direct
relationship
between
the
price
of
this
so
called
non-performing
leader
charges
and
the
amounts
that
the
sideman
will
receive
but
under
those
circumstances,
the
unions
regulation
of
a
price
is
legitimate
because
it
is
justice
white's
words,
a
matter
of
imminent
and
direct
concern.
but
that
is
a
quite
different
argument
your
honor
than
our
fundamental
argument
about
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
because
your
honor,
our
answer
there
is
tied
very
directly
to
the
special
circumstances
of
this
industry
is
found
by
the
trial
judge
and
that
is
the
kind
of
fluidity,
the
interchangeability
among
functions
in
this
particular
used
to
be
as
such
and
the
lack
of
any
capital
and
requirement
of
any
capital
investment
in
the
specific
findings
based
upon
the
evidence
that
where
the
leader
be
he
performing
or
not
performing
does
not
obtain
as
a
price
to
the
unions
minimum
the
sideman
won't
be
paid.
now
that's
a
very
unusual
situation.
that's
quite
unlike
the
situation
which
your
honor
attempted
to
said
out
about
an
automobile
where
the
union
can't
show
that
kind
of
direct
intimate
relationship,
a
one
on
one
relationship
so
to
speak
and
i
think
that
the
--
basically,
these
notions
are
non-performing
leaders
is
really
de
minimis
in
the
sense
that
it's
so
small
apart.
what
we're
talking
about
primarily
is
our
concern
about
the
performing
leader,
about
the
leader
when
he
conducts
and
when
he
plays
on
an
instrument.
that
is
the
fundamental
aspect
of
our
case
and
when
he
does
that
as
i
have
indicated,
he
is
in
job
and
wage
competition
with
the
unions'
sidemen
or
sub-leader
members.
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
both
courts
concluded
that
the
union
had
a
right
to
seek
the
leader
as
a
member
and
the
trial
court
on
the
basis
again
of
that
particular
finding,
on
the
findings
of
displacement
and
of
job
and
wage
competition,
concluded
that
the
union
had
a
right
not
only
to
take
them
into
membership
but
to
set
a
rate
for
them.
just
a
rate
comparable
to
the
rate
for
other
musicians
and
to
require
in
order
that
that
rate
maybe
received
that
it
will
actually
be
received
by
that
particular
musician
that
they
each
have
a
minimum
price
through
the
purchase
or
the
music.
now
the
reason
for
the
charge
of
the
price
is
that
where
the
leader
or
any
independent
contractor
or
employer
in
this
sense
is
to
receive
moneys
and
if
you
call
an
employer
who
receives
prices,
if
you
call
him
an
employee,
he
receives
wages
but
it's
the
same
money
for
doing
the
same
thing
and
what
the
union
must
do
as
it
did
in
oliver
is
to
assure
that
he
in
fact
receives
in
his
pocket,
the
leader
in
our
case
or
the
owner
operator
in
the
oliver
case
that
your
honors
decided,
receives
in
his
pocket
the
amount
that
the
union
has
set
for
the
wage
scale
and
as
in
oliver,
he
is
in
fact
charging
an
amount
for
a
truck
which
is
less
than
the
true
rate
for
that
particular
truck,
he
is
not
getting
the
wage
scale
because
the
difference
between
the
true
rental
of
the
truck
and
the
amount
that
he
has
received
must
be
subtracted
from
his
wage
scale.
and
so
if
the
leader
here
receives
something
less
than
his
total
contribution
for
the
performance,
he
is
not
getting
the
wage
scale
for
the
function
that
he
is
performing,
conducting
and
acting
as
an
instrumentalist
and
that
is
essentially
our
argument.
there
is
of
course
the
argument
quite
different
about
the
situation
of
when
the
leader
does
not
perform
and
there,
as
i
attempted
to
indicate
to
justice
fortas,
the
special
circumstances
of
this
industry
and
the
miniscule
amounts
involved
in
that
particular
case,
show
that
the
union
has
not
violated
the
antitrust
laws
in
that
particular
circumstance
as
well.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
basically
a
de
minimis
but
also
because
of
the
very
explicit
findings
of
a
direct
relationship
between
price
and
wages
here,
that
in
this
particular
industry,
the
union
has
found
and
the
evidence
supported
that
the
trial
judge
found
that
unless
the
leader
be
he
performing
or
not,
receives
that
amount.
he
won't
pay
the
--
he
won't
pay
the
wages.
we're
dealing
with
a
very
special
kind
of
industry.
there
is
no
capital
requirement.
people
are
at
one
moment
leaders
and
the
next
moment
sidemen.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
the
phrase
non-performing
leader
your
honor
does
not
concern
the
one
who
waves
the
baton
conducting
was
stipulated
to
be
a
musical
function.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
and
that
--
so
that
when
a
leader
conducts,
he
is
a
performing
leader
in
the
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
non-performing
leader
is
the
one
in
the
situation
i
attempted
to
describe
where
a
man
gets
two
or
three
engagements
on
the
same
night
and
he
â€“
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
--
he
gets
someone
else
to
act
as
a
sub-leader
â€“
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well,
that
is
precisely
in
that
context.
the
union
is
looking
generally
to
the
man
who
sets
it
up
to
be
there
and
do
the
conducting
and
then
they
are
these
chance
situations
in
which
you
have
a
sub-leader
used
and
which
he
is
a
non-performing
leader.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
that's
a
quite
limited
amount
your
honor.
it's
a
minimum.
the
union
sets
a
minimum
price
which
is
the
scale
for
the
leader
himself,
for
the
function
he
is
performing
as
a
conductor
and
as
an
instrumentalist
plus
the
wage
of
the
sideman,
plus
an
amount
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
8%
which
was
stipulated
--
which
astounded
the
amount
necessary
for
various
income
tax
or
social
security
withholding.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
that's
correct
your
honor
under
the
social
security
regulations
he
is
responsible
for
that
particular
withholding,
so
that
we
have
three
basic
components
in
the
minimum
that
the
union
has
set.
each
of
this
is
an
amount
which
he
must
put
in
the
minimum
price
to
the
purchaser
of
the
music.
and
the
reason
that
these
are
included
is
to
assure
if
he
were
obligated
to
make
a
--
make
social
security
payments
of
a
certain
amount.
and
in
fact,
he
charges
a
minimum
price,
less
than
the
amount
of
his
own
scale
plus
that
withholding
amount.
he
would
in
fact
be
working
at
an
amount
less
than
the
union
scale
for
that
particular
job.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well
i
believe
your
honor,
that's
in
case
310.
the
plaintiffs
have
attempted
to
bring
that
point
up.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
the
territorial
restriction
is
strictly
a
term
and
condition
of
employment
that
involves
a
labor
dispute
within
the
meaning
of
section
13.
in
that
particular
aspect
as
the
trial
judge
pointed
out,
we're
strictly
dealing
with
the
question
of
what
a
union
may
do
in
order
to
obtain
benefits
for
its
members.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
basically
your
honor.
the
regulations
themselves
are
primarily
an
increase
in
scale.
a
new
york
musician
when
he
comes
down
in
washington
will
receive
--
it
is
required
by
union
regulations
to
receive
an
additional
amount
as
wages
10%.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no,
he
can
play.
there
are
certain
circumstances
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes
your
honor.
there
are
certain
circumstances
in
which
if
in
washington
on
a
long-term
engagement,
he
might
not
be
able
to
compete
and
these
are
on
certain
types
of
local
engagements
and
basically,
he
may
go
outside
and
they
do
all
the
time.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
the
union
regulations
your
honor,
indicated
union
and
the
leaders
have
agreed
that
all
of
these
regulations
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes
you
honor
because
of
the
finding
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
because
this
is
not
the
kind
of
combination
that
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
we
are
relying
--
i'm
really
on
the
exemption
because
there's
no
combination
with
any
non-labor
group.
the
reason
that
the
leaders
are
in
the
union
is
because
of
the
job
and
wage
competition
which
make
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
because
it's
part
of
the
wages
your
honor
and
when
they
work
on
the
road
like
any
other
musician,
they
are
to
receive
additional
wages
because
--
they're
working
musicians.
when
they
go
on
the
road,
they
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well,
the
answer
there
your
honor
is
that
the
so
called
booking
agents
are
â€“-
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
pardon
me?
yes
they
are.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes
your
honor.
that
certainly
does
not
violate
the
antitrust
laws.
what
we're
seeking
in
that
circumstance
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
your
honor
on
that
particular
point,
as
you
know
the
court
of
appeals
found
a
total
lack
of
standing
and
here
--
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
issue
was
presented
in
the
plaintiff's
certiorari
petition
but
here
again,
there
is
a
relationship.
all
that
the
union
has
done
here
will
say
to
its
members,
don't
accept
kick
backs
from
a
given
group.
there
is
no
combination
with
caterers.
there's
no
agreement
with
caterers,
the
union's
own
internal
regulations.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes
there
is
by
the
terms
of
the
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
as
i
understand
your
honor,
we're
charged
with
price
fixing
that
the
union
by
setting
a
minimum
amount
for
each
that
the
leader
must
charge
on
what
we
call
the
purchase
of
the
music
on
each
particular
engagement
hasn't
engaged
in
price
fixing.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
that
the
union
is
engaged
in
price
fixing
by
setting
this
forth
in
a
union
regulation
which
is
adhered
to
by
certain
union
members
called
leaders
and
that
in
that
sense,
the
union
has
agreed
on
a
price.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
this
is
a
minimum
of
course
your
honor.
it's
a
minimum
which
reflects
only
the
sidemen
scale,
the
performing
instrumentalist
scale
as
in
writing
and
the
minimum
for
the
leader
himself
who
was
a
working
musician.
that's
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
that's
when
the
union
and
the
so
called
--
its
own
members.
that's
part
of
the
difficulty
in
this
case
your
honor
that
the
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
its
own
members,
yes.
so
called
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no.
the
union
regulations
can't
reach
anyone
who
is
not
a
member.
the
--
this
is
all
done
by
internal
union
regulation.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
pardon
me?
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well,
there
are
no
such
agreements
your
honor.
we
just
don't
reach
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
basically
your
honor
that
the
--
because
they
are
members
and
they
have
become
members
legitimately.
there's
a
charge
that
they
are
improperly
members
of
the
union
and
both
courts
rejected
that
because
of
the
finding
that
they
are
properly
members
of
the
union
based
upon
the
fact
that
they
compete
with
our
--
with
other
members
of
the
union,
we
say
that
we
have
a
right
to
regulate
them
like
any
other
members.
they
are
properly
members
and
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
they
raise
various
other
issues
your
honor
which
were
disposed
of
in
our
favor
by
both
courts
below.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well,
as
i
understand,
that
is
basically
their
contention.
as
i
understand
it,
there
are
a
lots
of
other
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well,
they
also
your
honor
as
i
understand
their
complaint
--
complain
that
we
reach
agreements
with
other
--
with
other
people
like
nightclubs
and
booking
agents
and
hotel
--
but
in
those
--
with
regards
to
the
nightclubs
and
the
recording
company,
there
is
an
expressed
finding
that
those
come
--
we
do
not
said
any
price
in
that
circumstance
number
one,
the
--
and
the
finding
was
that
these
other
people
are
employers
and
not
the
leaders
so
that
the
leader
has
lost
even
the
--
even
the
possibility
of
being
the
independent
employer
businessmen
in
those
situations
where
we
have
agreements.
he
is
not
because
of
the
nature
of
his
job
function
or
other
things.
he
is
not
the
employer
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
well,
he
say,
they
admit
that
he
is
a
member
of
the
union.
they
think
that
he
is
improperly
a
member
of
the
union
and
they
argue
that
no
leader
should
be
a
member
of
the
union.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
what
club-date-field.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
in
what
we
call
the
club-date
field.
and
that
field
alone
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
that
would
be
outside
in
terms
of
labors
exemption
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no,
not
nearly
by
joining
the
union
but
by
belonging
to
a
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no.
it's
not
the
joining
of
the
union
your
honor.
it's
the
existence
of
job
and
wage
competition
with
the
union's
employee
members.
it's
the
threat
that
these
people
present
to
the
union,
to
the
sidemen
who
are
admitted
employee.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
that
of
course
was
not
the
situation
before
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
i
would
say
that
that's
a
violation
but
because
you
have
the
critical
element
the
fact
that
the
union's
regulation
is
predicated
upon
the
existence
of
job
and
wage
competition.
the
competition
with
the
employee
members
and
that
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
oh
yes,
certainly
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
we
would
have
the
right
to
seek
and
to
have
them
do
this,
yes,
but
because
they
are
in
job
and
wage
competition.
your
honors,
this
is
really
precisely
what
was
involved
in
the
oliver
case
that
particular
line
of
analysis
because
in
oliver,
there
was
no
indication
that
the
owner
operators
were
members
of
the
union
and
yet
the
union
was
setting
a
price
that
the
owner
operator
was
to
charge
back
to
the
â€“
of
the
truck.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no
but
we
did
by
an
agreement
with
him
to
determine
what
another
independent
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
but
we
do
not
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
what
we
did
in
that
particular
instance,
the
union
was
setting
the
sales
price
of
the
owner
operator
because
it
was
reaching
the
price
of
the
truck.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
i
believe
it's
precisely
what
we're
doing
here
your
honor.
we're
setting
an
amount
that
as
a
minimum
which
is
intended
to
assure
that
the
leader
receive
the
amount
that
he
gets
for
working
as
a
performing
musician.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
the
answer
is,
where
the
man
is
coming
himself
working
as
an
electrician,
taking
work
away
that
the
union
if
it's
necessary
can
set
a
minimum
price
which
will
assure
that
the
man
will
receive
in
his
own
pocket
the
minimum
wage
that
the
union
set
for
that
type
of
work.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
yes
your
honor.
the
oliver
case
makes
clear--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
analytically
your
honor,
it
makes
clear
that
where
the
union
is
attempting
to
set
a
price
in
order
to
assure
that
the
wage
scale
is
not
subverted
then
that
is
not
a
constitute
of
violation
of
the
antitrust
law.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
pardon
me?
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
thank
you.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no
your
honor,
the
allen
bradley
case
to
which
you're
referring
involved
a
conspiracy
in
which
a
union
came
to
the
aid
of
already
existing
conspiracy.
both
courts
below
here
rejected
the
notion
that
out
of
this
case
approached
the
allen
bradley
posture.
they
both
rejected
the
notion
that
there
was
a
conspiracy.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
but
only
through
a
very
indirect
fashion
and
only
through
creating
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no,
i
think
that
justice
fortas
made
it
in
quite
a
direct
situation
where
the
electrician
is
in
fact
working
on
the
job
and
on
those
circumstances
in
that
limited
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
certainly
not
your
honor.
the
essential
element
here
is
the
fact
that
these
people
are
working
at
the
trade
and
there
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
our
regulations
are
limited
to
those
situations
when
he
is
working
at
the
trade
and
we
do
what
is
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
if
he
is
in
job
and
wage
competition,
he
may
legitimately
be
sought
as
a
member
of
the
union.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no.
that
was
involved
under
wisconsin's
little
norris-laguardia
act.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
no
sir,
your
honor.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
in
my
opponent's
argument,
there
are
many,
many
statements
made
about
lots
of
things
that
the
musician's
union
does
lots
of
statements
about
the
nature
of
various
negotiations.
none
of
these
things
are
in
the
record
and
none
of
them
are
the
facts
as
they
exist.
the
facts
are
as
found
by
the
district
judge
and
as
confirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
your
honors,
i
have
before
you
a
distillation
of
a
lengthy
trial
in
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
an
apt
description
of
what
occurs
in
this
particular
industry.
and
the
argument
that
you've
heard
today
has
very
little
to
do
in
fact
with
that
particular
industry.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
do
we
challenge
any
of
the
findings?
no,
your
honor.
there
are
--
there
is
one
or
two
little
matters
of
--
very
small
concern,
but
nothing
of
a
fundamental
nature.
their
--
in
my
opponent's
presentation
today,
he
made
the
statement,
and
i
think
this
really
lies
at
the
heart
of
our
case,
your
honors,
that
the
sub-leader
stands
in
the
place
of
the
leader.
now,
there
was
a
stipulation
that
the
sub-leader
is
an
employee.
there
was
also
a
stipulation
that
the
sideman
is
an
employee.
now,
when
this
--
when
the
sub-leader
stands
in
the
place
of
the
leader,
when
he
performs
precisely
the
same
work
function,
then
there
is
such
danger
to
the
wage
standards
of
the
sub-leaders
and
of
the
sidemen
musicians
when
the
leader
is
permitted
to
form
--
perform
in
an
unregulated
fashion
that
the
union
has
the
right
to
reach
that
particular
type
of
disruption
of
its
wage
standards,
and
that
is
the
basis
of
our
reliance
upon
oliver
and
of
our
reliance
upon
jewell
t.
and
this
court's
expressed
recognition
in
jewell
t.
that
there
are
times
when
the
--
that
it's
not
the
form
of
the
--
of
the
agreement
that
is
critical.
it's
the
impact
of
the
agreement.
and
here,
the
impact
of
the
union's
regulations
upon
the
leader
is
to
preserve
the
wage
standards
of
the
employees,
the
stipulated
employees
on
this
record,
the
sidemen
and
the
sub-leaders,
these
--
this
was
stipulated
that
these
people
are
employees
and
the
critical
aspect
of
the
union's
regulation
is
an
attempt
to
preserve
those
wage
standards
against
diminution
by
a
leader
who
works
at
an
amount
less
than
that.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
because
the
â€“
just
as
the
union
has
the
right
to
say
when
a
musician
plays
two
instruments,
he
will
receive
a
certain
amount
more.
in
those
fields
in
which
the
leader
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
because
typically
in
this
field,
and
it
was
stipulated,
your
honor,
that
in
those
fields
in
which
the
leader
is
admittedly
an
employee
under
the
findings
of
both
courts
below,
the
--
so
the
recording
in
television,
the
leader
always
receives
a
--
an
amount
two
times.
he
always
receive
twice
the
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
that's
no
different
than
the
union
is
saying,
is
it
does,
your
honor,
that
the
--
a
musician
who
performs
on
two
instruments
shall
receive
and
additional
amount.
the
leader
in
playing
an
instrument
and
conducting
is
performing
on
the
job,
essentially
two
types
of
job.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
in
that
particular
circumstance,
your
honor,
he
does
not
receive
two
times.
he
receives
in
the
end
for
himself
only
25%
because
the
sub-leader
gets
the
main
--
gets
half
of
that
additional
amount
under
those
circumstances.
the
leader,
when
he
does
not
perform,
does
not
receive
a
full
amount.
he
in
fact
turns
to
--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
because
for
a
number
of
reasons,
your
honor.
number
one,
the
reason
that
judge
friendly
has
signed
is
because
that
is
very
much
a
part
of
the
musical
engagement,
and
this
is
essentially
a
musical
function.
the
major
argument,
your
honor,
which
is
quite
different
in
our
--
than
our
argument
about
whether
a
leader
performs,
is
that
because
of
the
special
nature
of
this
industry
and
as
found
by
the
trial
court
that
in
this
particular
industry,
wages
suffer
when
the
price
does
not
meet
the
minimum
wage
of
the
--
the
minimum
wage
scales
that
the
union
has
set
forth.
we're
not
attempting
to
get
an
increase
in
wages
or
anything
like
that.
what
we're
talking
about
is
in
this
particular
industry,
as
the
trial
judge
found,
there's
a
direct
relationship
and
that
wages
do
suffer.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
not
really.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
if
there
were
--
if
there
were
findings
for
the
type
that
were
made
here
showing
that
there
is
--
that
there
is
scrimping,
where
there's
scrimping
that
the
wages
suffer,
than
in
that
particular
circumstance
a
very
narrow
situation--
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
if
you
had
that
kind
of
a
record,
your
honor.
now,
that's
very
unusual,
and
what
happens
is
the
very
unusualness
of
this
industry
and
the
union's
experiences
as
found
by
the
trial
judge
are
the
justification
which
we
point
to
on
this
--
on
this
narrow
instance
where
the
leader
does
not
perform.
and
the
other
situation,
the
matter
is
much
clearer.
mr.
ronald
rosenberg
thank
you.
