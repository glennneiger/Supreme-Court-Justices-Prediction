mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
your
honors
that
i
do
not
represent
most
of
the
people
in
the
spectrum
of
employers
in
this
field
to
which
judge
friendly
refers
in
his
descending
opinion.
i
quite
agree
with
judge
friendly
that
there
is
a
varying
spectrum
beginning
with
the
kind
of
person
who
files
as
an
orchestra
leader,
maybe
once
or
twice
a
year
because
some
friend
or
relative
asked
him
to
serve
as
an
orchestra
leader,
and
the
kind
of
orchestra
leader
represented
by
benny
goodman
who
is
a
named
band
leader.
now,
the
people
that
i
represent
are
professional
orchestra
leaders.
they
never
work
as
sideman
with
one
rare
exception
and
that
is
true
even
of
named
band
leaders.
stan
compton
is
perhaps
one
of
the
famous
named
band
leaders
in
the
country
and
he
admitted
that
he
had
someone
substitute
for
him
when
he
was
ill
--
right
on
this
record.
but
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
surely.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
i
would
be
happy
to
do
it
right
now.
yes.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
my
charge.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
no,
it
is
not
limited
to
that.
that
indeed
is
one
of
the
points
of
my
charge
that
union
members
have
combined
by
means
of
the
bylaws
with
which
they
comply
and
that
is
to
say
as
thank
you.
i'm
sorry
if
my
voice
breaks
every
now
and
then
but
i
just
got
up
from
a
cold.
i
am
not
--
i'm
saying
that
indeed,
the
orchestra
leaders
in
the
class
that
that
i
represent,
the
professional
orchestra
leaders
have
agreed
by
these
bylaws
among
themselves
to
fix
prices
and
never
to
compete
below
those
prices.
and
your
honors,
there's
not
one
--
evidence
in
the
record
to
contradict
that
but
i
go
beyond
the
members.
i
go
to
for
example,
the
booking
agents.
obviously,
the
booking
agents
are
important
for
named
bands
and
for
named
bands
that
haven't
had
even
national
reputations
but
local
reputations.
that's
one
of
the
outside
groups
that
i'm
talking
about.
then
i
talk
about
hotels,
nightclubs
and
restaurants.
take
for
example
the
situation
that
prevails
in
new
york
city.
local
802,
every
so
and
so
often
negotiates
with
representatives
of
the
hotels,
nightclubs
and
restaurant
and
presumably,
the
negotiation
is
confined
to
the
employees,
the
hotels,
nightclubs
and
restaurant.
that's
what
it
appears
in
the
surface.
but
your
honors,
that
isn't
true
and
the
facts
in
this
record
are
contradicted
on
that
point.
every
one
of
my
clients
performs
in
one
of
the
other
--
of
hotels
nightclubs
and
restaurants
in
the
city
of
new
york
but
they
must
comply
even
in
single
engagements
with
the
standards,
the
wage
turn
out
--
wages,
house
and
working
conditions,
fixed
by
the
hotels,
nightclub
and
restaurants
and
the
union.
mind
you,
they
were
not
ready
to
these
negotiations
in
anyway.
they
didn't
even
have
notice
on
them
but
the
negotiations
at
that
time
were
now
applied
to
my
clients,
the
same
is
true
of
when
we
say
radio,
television.
the
radio
and
television
contract
is
negotiated
with
the
big
companies.
all
of
the
smaller
companies
then
follow
--
the
union
prints
a
contract
and
they
all
have
to
sign
it
and
when
my
clients
perform
a
single
engagement
and
they
don't
do
it
often,
i
will
admit.
when
my
clients
perform
a
single
engagement
on
radio
or
television,
they
must
comply
with
the
negotiations
--
negotiated
standards
between
the
big
television
or
radio
stations
and
the
--
now,
i
want
to
say
too
your
honors
that
my
complaint
from
the
beginning,
urge
the
fundamental
distinction
between
said
steady
and
single
engagements,
no
other.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honors
can
look
in
vain
through
the
bylaws
of
the
international
or
the
local
to
find
any
reference
to
club-dates.
club-dates
are
just
one
department,
the
largest
department
that
i
would
admit
has
single
engagements
and
when
the
court
below
ruled
on
price
fixing
for
example,
it
did
not
use
the
words
club-date.
it
said
orchestral
engagements
so
that
it
covered
both
single
and
steady
engagements.
now,
it
would
be
easy,
i
think,
on
the
basis
of
this
record
to
be
confused
by
the
fact
that
there
are
--
there
were
testimony
from
a
variety
of
different
types
of
orchestra
leaders.
on
the
union
side,
the
union
did
not
produce
one
single
witness
who
was
a
professional
orchestra
leader,
not
one.
that
is
to
say
one
who
gave
his
full
time
to
being
an
orchestra
leader
never
played
his
assignment,
and
they
are
the
only
people
that
i
represent.
i
don't
have
to
go
into
the
status
of
this
other
margin
of
the
type
of
orchestra
leader
because
i'm
not
concerned
with
them.
my
own
disposition
is
to
believe
that
even
they
are
employers
pro
tonto
but
that's
not
essential
to
my
case
here
and
i
think
that
when
mr.
--
when
judge
friendly
in
his
dissenting
opinion
below
spoke
in
terms
of
interchangeability,
he
was
talking
about
the
kind
of
orchestra
leader
that
i
don't
represent.
i
have
no
doubt
that
max
sanso
who
testified
that
during
the
three
years,
he
had
eight
or
nine
engagements.
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
could
improvise
orchestra
at
any
time
and
that
he
would
be
interchangeable
in
that
with
other
employee
musicians.
that
isn't
the
point.
i'm
talking
about
the
kind
of
orchestra
leader
who
is
the
professional
and
he
is
vastly
different
from
the
employee
sideman
because
he
is
the
risk
taker
in
this
situation.
it
isn't
as
the
--
my
adversary's
briefs
reported
and
that
as
mr.
rosenberg
just
put
it
that
the
usual
procedure
is
for
purchaser
of
music
to
approach
of
musician.
no
your
honors,
the
usual
procedure
is
for
my
clients
to
run
up
telephone
bills
of
$4,000.00
and
$5,000.00
a
year
when
they
read
in
the
newspaper
about
fourth
coming
social
events.
and
they
solicit
and
when
they
have
--
didn't
have
that
kind
of
solicitation,
in
the
end
accumulated
the
kudos
that
comes
with
reputation
then
people
come
to
them
and
call
them
up.
they
never
go
to
my
client's
sideman
and
ask
them
to
get
together
in
orchestra.
and
when
my
client
stands
before
an
orchestra,
they
do
one
or
three
things.
some
of
my
clients
like
charles
peterson
had
never
play
an
instrument.
he
simply
conducts
and
leads
but
most
orchestra
leaders
who
are
in
the
class
of
professional
orchestra
leaders
do
in
fact
play
an
instrument
but
they
play
it
differently
your
honors
than
the
ordinary
sideman.
in
the
first
place,
the
sideman
plays
continuously.
the
orchestra
leader
leads
by
playing.
he
bows
his
head.
he
makes
gestures.
he
gives
emphasis
and
in
that
way,
he
keeps
the
ensemble,
he
denotes
the
tempo
and
so
on
and
he
is
in
charge.
he
is
perfectly
obvious
i
think
to
anyone
that
knows
anything
about
orchestra
performances
that
if
they
were
all
to
play
at
random,
even
the
same
piece,
they
couldn't
even
keep
time.
someone
has
to
be
there
to
lead
them
and
that
is
what
my
clients
do.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
do
they
play
an
instrument?
all
but
peterson.
peterson
does
not
play
an
instrument.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
never
plays
an
instrument.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
oh
yes,
there
are
quite
a
few
of
those.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
some
of
the
most
successful
ones
today,
no
longer
play
an
instrument
and
all
of
my
clients
your
honor,
refused
to
play
an
instrument
when
the
orchestra
is
eight
men
or
more.
if
the
orchestra
that
they
assemble
is
eight
men
or
more
then
they
confine
themselves
only
to
leading
either
with
a
baton
or
with
their
hands.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
i
didn't
say
that
but
it's
practically
true
your
honor
because
whenever
an
events
of
any
kind,
the
required
music
are
arranged
with
the
banquet
manager
of
the
hotel
and
that's
in
the
record
undisputed.
the
banquet
manager
of
the
hotel
tells
them,
you
better
have
only
afm
members
otherwise
you're
going
to
have
later
trouble.
and
in
that
way
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
yes.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
yes,
there
is
a
specific
provision
in
local
802
bylaws
that
says
that
the
executive
board
of
local
802
must
approve
each
orchestra
leader
and
it
reserves
to
itself
the
right
to
cancel
the
contract.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
they
don't
your
honor
have
a
written
agreement
containing
that
verbiage
expressly.
but
that's
the
way
it's
enforced.
in
other
words,
they
do
have
written
agreements
with
the
hotels,
nightclubs
and
restaurants
and
the
hotels,
nightclubs,
and
restaurants
cooperate
with
the
union
by
telling
all
of
their
patrons,
you
must
have
afm
members.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
they
couldn't
get
a
job
as
an
employee
or
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
as
a
leader
--
your
honor,
i
must
say
that
there
are
some
few
cases
where
leaders
are
employees.
i
don't
represent
them
and
i
thought
you're
referring
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
my
clients?
they
--
in
all
probability,
they
could
not
get
a
job
but
there
might
be
some
cases
in
some
hotels
that
are
not
as
careful
about
that
and
wouldn't
object
to
it
but
i
know
that
there's
always
trouble
when
they
don't
belong
to
the
union
and
that's
the
reason
why
two
of
the
plaintiffs
here,
peterson
and
carroll
for
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
some
--
in
some
places,
yes
and
in
some
places,
no.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
no
your
honor.
you
must
understand
that
by
virtue
of
an
agreement
in
front
of
judge
friendly,
my
clients,
peterson
and
carroll
agreed
that
they're
with
the
union,
that
their
orchestras
could
perform
in
this
hotels,
nightclubs
and
restaurants,
provided
carroll
and
peterson
did
not
actually
direct
them
or
play
an
instrument
while
directing
them.
so
that
was
a
provision
of
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
that's
exactly
a
point.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
that's
right.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
yes
your
honor,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
right.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
that's
called
the
hotel
agreement.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
well
your
honor,
the
terms
of
that
agreement
provide
for
example
for
payment
into
a
welfare
fund.
we
have
challenged
the
first
welfare
fund
and
had
been
successful
and
that
having
it
dissolved.
we
are
presently
challenging
the
current
welfare
fund
but
that
case
hasn't
been
decided
yet.
it
hasn't
been
brought
to
trial.
but
one
of
the
terms
of
that
contract
would
be
that
my
clients
must
contribute
to
this
welfare
fund,
negotiated
between
the
hotels
and
my
client
--
and
the
union.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
that
would
be
true
even
if
they're
not
members
of
the
union,
yes
your
honor.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
many
of
the
purchasers
of
music
who
are
admittedly
not
employers
at
all
of
the
sidemen
are
making
contributions
today
to
the
local
802
steady
engagement
welfare
fund.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
not
at
the
present
time
your
honor.
there
was
originally
such
an
agreement
and
i
believe
it
was
brought
after
the
institution
of
our
action
that
that
was
withdrawn.
but
despite
the
fact
that
the
language
is
absent
in
today's
contract,
the
banquet
managers
admitted
when
they
took
the
stand,
we
had
i
believe
five
of
them.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
that's
right?
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
oh
yes.
that
was
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
well
that's
the
minimum
price
which
is
made
at
the
so
called
price
meeting
of
local
802.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
oh
yes
your
honor.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
i
don't
think
that's
quite
a
fair
way
to
point
justice
fortas
--
may
i
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
i
will.
the
price
list
booklet
of
local
802
isolates
11
items
which
are
the
ingredients
of
price.
first,
wages
which
they
unilaterally
prescribe
without
collective
bargaining.
second,
minimums
which
are
minimum
employment
quotas
and
they
too
are
unilaterally
prescribed
by
the
local
802
executive
board.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
well,
that
means
that
for
example
the
grand
ballroom
of
the
waldorf
astoria
hotel
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
--
must
have
12
musicians
including
the
leader,
including
the
leader
because
the
leader
is
counted
i
this
minimum
quotas.
this
is
a
little
different
from
the
average
case
where
a
union's
bylaws,
fixes
regulations
for
minimum
quotas.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
the
third
one
is
the
leader's
money.
that
is
to
say
for
clients
like
mine
will
always
have
three
or
more
musicians
at
least.
that
means
they
get
double
--
they
must
get
double
the
money
that
the
sideman
gets
for
what
is
called
the
leaders
fee
and
they
have
no
right
to
waive
that.
they
may
not
wave
it
but
it
will
be
brought
up
on
charges
if
they
waive
it.
the
fourth
is
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
the
leaders
will
be
brought
up
on
charges.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
well,
yes
in
one
sense
only.
i
have
had
cases
where
my
clients
were
expelled
from
the
union
and
i
thought,
well,
exposure
from
the
union
meant
that
they
were
no
longer
members
but
they
were
brought
up
on
charges
nevertheless
as
expelled
members.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
the
fourth
one,
cartage
fees.
for
example,
a
double
base
is
a
bulky
instrument
and
therefore,
a
certain
amount
of
extra
charge
for
that.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
the
fifth
is
mileage
fees.
now,
here's
something
that's
very
distinctive.
if
my
client
ben
cutler
who
is
nationally
known
as
an
orchestra
leader,
books
for
engagements
in
chicago,
he
must
book
that
each
one
of
those
engagements
have
the
price
indicated
by
these
ingredients
i'm
describing.
but
obviously,
the
mileage
fee
is
only
taken
care
of
once
because
you
try
to
go
there
only
once
and
play
four
engagements
and
come
back.
but
the
union
regulation
requires
that
you
multiply
the
mileage
fee
four
times
so
that
each
one
of
the
persons
for
whom
he
performs
must
play
the
mileage
fee.
the
next
is
the
8%
surcharge
which
the
union
explained
as
something
does
defray
the
bookkeeping
cost
and
the
social
security
and
so
on.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
that's
paid
to
the
leader.
he
must
charge
that
to
his
purchaser
of
music.
the
seventh
is
lodge,
i
mean
that
uniforms
where
he
does
require
them.
the
eighth
is
food
and
lodging
according
to
certain
standards
fixed
by
the
union.
the
ninth
is
transportation
costs
which
are
supposed
to
be
according
to
the
form
b
contract
and
i
might
say
here
that
the
union
prescribes
the
form
of
a
contract
that
my
client
as
a
businessman
and
employer
must
use
in
dealing
with
his
purchasing.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
the
tenth
is
the
10%
traveling
surcharge
up
to
a
certain
point
in
the
beginning
of
1964,
and
that
was
a
10%
addendum
to
the
price
because
of
traveling.
but
now,
it
is
called
the
10%
wage
differential.
and
of
that,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
is
a
price
differential
in
actuality.
and
the
eleventh
is
the
contribution
to
the
welfare
program.
now,
these
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
that's
--
that's
all
of
them,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
the
union
--
i
don't
know
how
to
answer
that,
your
honor
because
during
the
trial,
the
union
attorney
took
the
position
that
the
words
‘price'
and
‘wage'
were
interchangeable.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
i
think
some
of
them
pertain
to
price.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
right,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
surely.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
yes
your
honor,
when
the
--
when
the
hotel
hires
him.
but
if
one
of
the
customers
of
the
hotel,
that
is
to
say,
one
of
the
--
some
association
who
wants
to
run
a
dinner
dance,
then
he
--
then
the
association
must
be
charged
with
this
amount.
and
the
witnesses
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
no,
no,
by
my
client
in
that
case.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
well,
i
--
i
took
about
four
pages
i
believe
in
my
reply
brief
to
try
to
distinguish
the
oliver
case
and
i
take
the
position
personally
that
it
is
not
relevant
here.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
oh,
i
don't
think
that
you
--
you
can
merely
baptize
these
items
as
wages
and
then
say,
you
see,
it's
nothing
but
a
wage
question.
i
think
you
have
to
be
realistic.
this
is
a
matter
of
--
of
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
well,
i
would
say
that
for
example,
some
of
those
items
are
clearly
part
of
pricing
and
some
are
wages.
for
instance,
the
unilaterally
prescribed
wages,
i
can't
say
that
that's
part
of
--
that's
pricing
as
such,
but
i
do
object
to
the
manner
in
which
they
do
it.
they
unilaterally
prescribe
the
wages
but
when
you
have
leader's
money,
when
you
have
the
8%
surcharge,
when
you
have
the
cartage,
when
you
have
the
minimum
quota
of
employer
--
employees
where
the
minimum
quota
includes
the
employer
himself,
then
i
say
these
are
all
ingredients
of
price
and
not
of
wage.
that's
what
i
mentioned,
your
honor.
now,
i
might
say
too
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
significant
question
on
the
item
of
whether
or
not
my
em
--
my
clients
are
employers
and
every
one
of
the
people
i
called,
every
single
one
of
them
testified
in
effect
that
my
clients
were
employers,
but
the
significant
question
is
not
whether
these
employers
do
certain
things
which
are
similar
to
things
done
by
the
union.
they're
not
exactly
the
same
because
by
that
token,
a
glassblower
employer,
an
electrician
employer,
any
kind
of
employer,
including
the
president
of
general
motors,
he
certainly
does
certain
things
that
some
employees
can
do
or
does
certain
things
that
are
similar
to
what
employees
do.
the
important
question
is,
are
they
businessmen
with
independent
businesses
and
are
they
employers?
and
i
say
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
contradict
the
repeated
testimony
that
my
clients
are
employers
and
independent
businessmen.
now,
we
come
to
the
--
another
question,
and
that
is
a
strain
that
goes
through
all
of
my
adversaries'
briefs.
they
keep
talking
about
job
and
wage
competition,
and
this
was
true
in
--
during
the
trial
constantly,
but
no
one,
including
the
courts
below
or
my
adversaries
ever
took
the
trouble
to
analyze
precisely
what
is
meant
by
competition
in
these
circumstances.
and
as
i
see
it,
there
are
only
seven
possibilities.
first
of
all,
the
competitors
must
necessarily
be,
if
i
understand
them
correctly,
orchestra
leaders
like
my
clients
who
are
entrepreneurs,
and
employee
musicians
who
are
union
members.
those
are
the
two
competing
bodies.
now,
for
what
can
it
be
realistically
stated
they
compete?
well,
it's
conceivable
that
these
two
would
compete
for
jobs
as
leaders,
and
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
union
that
should
have
any
right
to
regulate
whether
a
sideman
should
compete
for
a
job
as
a
leader,
or
any
association
of
leaders
to
regulate
whether
a
sideman
should
compete
as
leaders.
and
incidentally,
justice
white,
there
is
an
association
here,
a
national
association
of
orchestra
leaders,
and
they
do
not
fix
prices.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
well
your
honor,
if
i
can
approximate
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
that's
right
because
--
because
we
did
have
one
session
between
the
representatives
of
the
national
association
of
orchestra
leaders
and
this
union,
and
one
of
the
things
that
we
told
them
we
couldn't
do
with
them
is
fixed
prices,
which
they
wanted
to
do.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
well,
if
it
--
if
the
--
i
don't
believe
it
is
really
a
collective
bargain
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
if
--
it
might
serve
the
same
purpose
but
you
certainly
not
arrive
at
the
same
way.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
because
my
clients
have
no
word
in
it.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
you
understand.
well,
as
i
say,
competition
for
jobs
as
leaders
is
really
nothing
except
competition
for
entry
into
the
ranks
of
employers,
and
i
don't
think
any
union
or
any
employee
association
has
the
right
to
close
the
door
on
that.
the
second
type
of
competition
would
be
for
jobs
as
sub-leaders.
now,
i
might
say
that
a
sub-leader
is
a
kind
of
supervisory
employee
musician
who
takes
over
the
direction
and
control
of
an
orchestra
when
the
employer
himself
can't
attend.
this
institution
of
sub-leaders
is
very
limited
throughout
the
united
states.
i
suppose
it
has
its
greatest
scope
in
the
city
of
new
york.
but
in
boston,
philadelphia
and
chicago,
i
think
there
are
a
few.
but
they
are
definitely
supervisors
within
the
meaning
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
my
opinion,
and
i
have
always
taken
the
position
that
if
congress
saw
it
fit
to
exclude
from
the
bargaining
unit
or
from
the
union
that
has
organized
the
employees,
the
supervisor
afore
certiorari,
then
employers
like
my
clients
should
not
be
in
the
union.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
they
supervise
the
conduct
of
the
particular
engagement.
they
conduct
the
orchestra.
they
watch
to
it
--
they
see
to
it
that
all
of
the
amenities
of
social
intercourse
are
observed.
if
an
orchestra
leader
--
orchestra
member
were
to
become
drunk,
they
have
the
power
of
firing
right
on
the
spot
or
order
him
home.
you
know,
they
stand
in
the
place
of
the
leader
during
the
performance.
the
third
kind
of
competition
would
be
for
--
for
jobs
as
sub-leaders.
now
--
i
mean,
for
jobs
as
sidemen.
it
should
be
obvious
that
professional
orchestra
leaders
who
command
much
more
of
income
than
either
sub-leaders
or
sidemen
are
not
competing
for
jobs
as
sub-leaders
or
as
sidemen.
my
clients
--
there
was
no
evidence
whatever
in
this
record
to
show
that
my
clients
ever
competed
for
jobs
as
sidemen
or
as
sub-leaders.
and
that
could
be
competition
for
musical
engagement
contracts.
that
would
be
more
or
less
in
the
way
of
acting
as
a
broker
or
a
man
says
i'll
--
i'll
get
you
the
band
or
give
me
the
contract
and
i'll
see
that
the
performance
is
carried
out
alright.
but
he
himself
is
neither
a
musician
or
if
he
is,
he
doesn't
perform.
that
kind
of
competition
wasn't
mentioned
in
our
record.
the
four
--
the
fifth
is
competition
for
the
income
of
professional
leaders.
and
again,
that
--
there
was
no
mention
of
that
in
any
part
of
the
record.
the
sixth,
well,
competition
for
wages
of
sub-leaders,
supervisors
not
mentioned
at
all
in
the
record,
and
seventh,
competition
for
wages
to
sidemen.
my
clients
never
competed
for
wages
of
sidemen,
but
there
was
no
evidence
of
that
up
to
that
point
at
all.
now,
i
think
that
it's
important
to
emphasize
briefly
that
judge
levet
at
the
trial
court,
when
he
talked
about
named
bands
assumed
that
named
bands
had
to
be
organizations
of
national
reputation.
i
submit
that
the
evidence
in
the
record
here
is
undisputed
that
a
man
can
have
a
named
band
in
the
city
of
great
new
york
or
in
the
environs
of
new
york
and
not
being
known
in
washington.
so
that
the
whole
question
of
name
is
a
very
relative
thing,
except
that
there
are
indeed
a
20
or
30
named
bands
that
command
towering
prices
and
great
audiences,
and
they
are
known
to
practically
everybody.
a
question
was
asked
about
whether
--
if
one
of
my
clients
were
to
come
to
washington
and
play
an
engagement
here
with
his
orchestra,
he
would
be
subject
to
filing
requirements
here
with
the
local
here.
the
answer
is
of
course
yes.
in
other
words,
he
would
have
to
file
his
contract
for
a
single
engagement
here
in
washington
and
the
local
here
in
washington
reserves
the
right
not
to
approve
it.
and
if
the
union
here
does
not
approve
it,
he
simply
can't
play
here.
this
is
done
regularly.
and
the
territorial
restrictions
are
very
numerous
that
are
imposed
unilaterally
by
this
union
and
abided
by
all
of
these
outsiders.
for
example,
one
of
the
provisions
in
the
bylaws
is
that
since
our
institution
of
the
suit
has
been
eliminated
was
a
provision
which
actually
told
the
leader
that
he
had
no
right
to
borrow
money
to
advance
the
business
of
his
own
orchestra
unless
he
got
the
permission
of
the
president
of
the
international.
then
of
course,
if
one
of
my
clients
were
to
book
an
--
a
steady
engagement
in
chicago,
for
example,
he
would
not
be
allowed
to
book
any
single
engagement
during
the
period
of
that
engagement
and
he
would
not
be
allowed
to
book
it
for
a
period
of
five
days
before
or
five
days
after.
and
he
couldn't
even
book
it
if
he
booked
it
during
that
period
to
be
performed
six
months
later.
and
many
of
the
locals
with
the
approval
of
the
international
seek
to
protect
the
local
musician,
the
local
orchestra
leader
from
competition
by
orchestra
leaders
who
invade.
and
of
course,
the
--
one
of
the
most
important
territorial
rules
is
that
whenever
one
of
my
clients
comes
from
new
york
and
visits
another
jurisdiction
where
the
prices
and
the
wages
are
lower,
my
client
is
bound
by
the
higher
of
the
two.
in
other
words,
since
the
local
802
rates
are
generally
speaking
throughout
the
united
states
the
highest
rates
in
the
industry,
my
client,
if
he
goes
to
newark,
new
jersey
for
example,
must
compete
with
local
musicians
there
on
the
basis
of
the
higher
new
york
prices
against
the
lower
newark
prices.
the
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
oh
no,
your
honor,
because
many
of
the
price
fixing
lists
appear
right
in
the
--
the
bylaws
of
the
afm
itself.
if
your
honors
were
to
examine
the
bylaws
as
they
prevail
at
that
time,
you
would
see
all
sorts
of
prices,
not
wages,
prices
fixed
for
also
--
for
instance,
at
a
carnival
or
a
rodeo
or
something
like
that.
now,
since
that
time,
the
latest
bylaws
that
i've
observed
has
kind
of
circumvented
that
difficulty
by
saying
write
to
the
office
of
the
president
for
the
prices
on
this,
and
they're
not
set
forth.
but
the
point
is
that
they
are
nationally
fixed
in
some
industries,
radio
and
television
being
a
pair
of
them.
the
--
i
want
to
make
sure
that
i
answered
justice
black's
question
continuously
now,
and
that
is
we
claim
that
the
violations
of
the
--
of
the
sherman
act
take
place
in
the
following
ways.
one,
all
of
our
locals
here,
all
of
the
afm
locals
and
the
afm
itself
have
regulations
which
impose
obligations
on
all
members,
including
orchestra
leader
employers,
that
they
can
never
compete
at
prices
below
the
prices
fixed
by
the
respective
locals
or
by
the
international.
they
--
article
25
of
the
afm
bylaws
requires
every
booking
agent
to
get
a
license
before
he
can
operate
as
a
booking
agent.
and
it
also
forbids
any
orchestra
leader
to
make
use
of
the
services
of
a
booking
agent
unless
he
is
licensed
by
the
afm.
now,
the
afm
reserves
the
right
to
vacate
the
license
of
the
booking
agent
for
a
good
reason,
a
bad
reason,
or
no
reason
at
all,
and
without
notice.
and
it
requires
the
booking
agent
to
sign
a
contract
that
he
will
--
all
his
negotiations
observe
the
bylaws
of
the
federation
and
of
the
local
involved.
and
finally,
the
--
one
of
the
most
effective
means
used
here
for
violating
the
sherman
act
is
the
use
of
the
form
b
contract.
now,
i
might
say
that
since
this
trial,
local
802,
because
of
the
constant
thunder
of
criticism
that
we
leveled
at
the
form
b
contract,
to
which
i'll
come
in
a
minute,
has
dropped
that
form
b
contract
and
published
another.
the
other
one
made
explicit
what
was
implicit
in
the
form
b
contract.
so
we
immediately
moved
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
an
injunction
against
it
because
it
fixed
prices
and
we
obtain
that.
thank
you.
may
it
please
the
court.
one
of
the
indications
of
the
matter
in
which
professional
leaders
garner
most
of
the
important
business
was
provided
by
one
--
three
exhibits
introduced
by
the
defendants
themselves,
defendants'
exhibits
l,
m
and
n.
and
one
of
those
three
showed
for
example
that
4.9%
of
the
persons
who
filed
contracts
as
leaders
had
gathered
into
their
business
52.4%
of
all
of
the
contracts
for
engagements
signed.
the
status
of
my
clients
as
employers,
contrary
to
what
the
district
court
found
without
the
benefit
of
any
evidence
in
the
record,
remained
the
same
even
when
they
play
on
radio
and
television,
or
when
they
do
recordings.
certainly,
it
should
be
obvious
that
a
named
band
leader
for
example
doesn't
change
his
status
as
employer
simply
because
he
makes
a
recording
with
his
own
musicians.
it
is
true
nevertheless
that
very
few
records
are
today
made
by
orchestras
as
such.
the
day
of
the
big
band
has
somewhat
receded.
but
whenever
my
clients,
like
for
instance,
sye
zetna,
one
of
them
--
he
made
--
i've
forgotten
how
many
albums.
whenever
he
performed,
he
performed
with
his
men
so
that
his
status
didn't
change.
and
hank
thompson
and
another
one
who
testified,
he's
one
of
the
leaders
in
the
field
of
country
music,
he
was
required
at
one
time
by
the
union
rules
and
by
--
by
the
recording
company
that
was
enforcing
the
union
rules
to
stop
the
system
under
which
he
was
getting
a
lump
sum
of
money.
and
now,
the
recording
company
advanced
out
of
his
royalties
moneys
to
pay
the
employees,
so
that
the
money
went
only
because
of
union
rules
from
the
insure
--
from
the
recording
company
to
his
employees
to
give
the
appearance
that
the
recording
company
is
the
employer,
but
it
was
subtracted
from
his
royalties.
i
am
challenging
those
findings
of
the
court
below
that
deal
with
competition.
i
say
there's
no
evidence
to
show
that
there's
competition.
and
also,
those
findings
of
the
court
below
that
say
that
my
clients
suddenly
lose
their
status
as
employer
or
businessmen
when
they
do
recordings
or
do
tv
appearances
or
television
appearance
because
i
say
there's
absolutely
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
substantiate
their
loss
of
their
status.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
your
honor,
i
specified
them
in
more
--
in
my
brief
somewhere,
but
i
don't
remember
the
number
offhand.
now,
i
referred
before
to
the
form
b
contract.
the
form
b
contract
not
only
is
the
result
of
a
mandate
from
the
bylaws
of
the
afm
but
it
is
a
mandate
that
is
pure
fiction
and
misrepresentation
in
significant
parts.
for
example,
the
orchestra
leader
who
makes
use
of
a
form
b
contract
is
required
to
acknowledge
by
his
signature
that
he
is
not
the
employer
but
rather
the
employee
of
the
purchaser
of
the
music.
and
yet,
that's
done
as
a
matter
of
form
without
any
relation
to
reality.
also,
the
form
b
contract
incorporates
by
reference
all
of
the
afm
bylaws
and
the
local
bylaws,
and
it
contains
the
fiction
for
example
that
the
purchaser
of
the
music
hires
the
sidemen
in
the
orchestra
through
the
agency
of
the
leader.
then,
one
of
the
things
that's
incorporated
by
reference
has
a
particular
bearing
upon
traveling
engagements.
you
can
understand
that
if
an
orchestra
travels
from
place
to
place,
they
--
if
he
visits
chicago
for
example
and
then
goes
to
san
francisco,
the
chicago
local
won't
be
able
to
have
jurisdiction
over
him
to
file
charges
of
any
kind.
well,
in
those
cases,
the
federation,
the
international
takes
care
of
all
the
charges
and
processes
them
and
adjudicates
them
by
means
of
the
international
executive
board.
and
if
there
are
any
fines,
as
there
sometimes
are,
the
fines
go
into
the
treasury
of
the
international,
the
very
organization
that
is
adjudicating
the
case
under
a
pseudo-arbitration
system.
the
purchaser
of
the
music,
even
though
he
is
not
the
purchaser
in
the
ordinary
sense,
is
sometimes
subjected
to
union
boycotts
and
threats
in
this
way.
if
an
orchestra
leader
is
not
a
member
of
the
union
or
if
he
charges
less
than
the
minimum
price
prescribed
by
the
union
and
he
does
that
in
x
dancehall
in
oshkosh,
then
that
x
dancehall
is
now
put
on
an
unfair
list
and
no
other
person
belonging
to
the
union,
whether
employer
or
employee,
is
permitted
to
perform
there
until
he's
taken
off
that
list.
and
of
course,
i
don't
know
whether
i
stressed
before
that
no
booking
agent
is
allowed
to
book
for
any
musician
unless
he
belongs
to
the
afm
or
one
of
its
locals.
i'd
conclude
with
this
quotation
from
the
pennington
case
and
with
a
suggestion
that
what
was
left
to
speculation
and
hypothesis
in
the
pennington
case
is
the
case
that's
actually
presented
to
your
honors
today.
if
the
umw,
in
this
case,
in
order
to
protect
its
weight
scale
by
maintaining
employer
income
had
presented
a
set
of
prices
at
which
the
mine
operators
would
be
required
to
sell
their
coal,
the
union
and
the
employers
who
happened
to
agree
could
not
successfully
defend
this
contract
provision
if
it
were
challenged
under
the
anti-trust
laws
by
the
united
states
or
by
somebody
injured
by
the
arrangement.
that's
the
quotation,
and
that
is
exactly
the
case
we
have
here
because
price
lists,
as
the
president
of
the
local
--
of
the
international
admitted,
are
universal.
every
single
local
of
the
683
locals
of
the
federation
have
their
own
price
lists.
and
the
federation
itself
has
its
price
lists
on
national
problems.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
your
honors
that
i
do
not
represent
most
of
the
people
in
the
spectrum
of
employers
in
this
field
to
which
judge
friendly
refers
in
his
descending
opinion.
i
quite
agree
with
judge
friendly
that
there
is
a
varying
spectrum
beginning
with
the
kind
of
person
who
files
as
an
orchestra
leader,
maybe
once
or
twice
a
year
because
some
friend
or
relative
asked
him
to
serve
as
an
orchestra
leader,
and
the
kind
of
orchestra
leader
represented
by
benny
goodman
who
is
a
named
band
leader.
now,
the
people
that
i
represent
are
professional
orchestra
leaders.
they
never
work
as
sideman
with
one
rare
exception
and
that
is
true
even
of
named
band
leaders.
stan
compton
is
perhaps
one
of
the
famous
named
band
leaders
in
the
country
and
he
admitted
that
he
had
someone
substitute
for
him
when
he
was
ill
--
right
on
this
record.
but
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
surely.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
i
would
be
happy
to
do
it
right
now.
yes.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
my
charge.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
no,
it
is
not
limited
to
that.
that
indeed
is
one
of
the
points
of
my
charge
that
union
members
have
combined
by
means
of
the
bylaws
with
which
they
comply
and
that
is
to
say
as
thank
you.
i'm
sorry
if
my
voice
breaks
every
now
and
then
but
i
just
got
up
from
a
cold.
i
am
not
--
i'm
saying
that
indeed,
the
orchestra
leaders
in
the
class
that
that
i
represent,
the
professional
orchestra
leaders
have
agreed
by
these
bylaws
among
themselves
to
fix
prices
and
never
to
compete
below
those
prices.
and
your
honors,
there's
not
one
--
evidence
in
the
record
to
contradict
that
but
i
go
beyond
the
members.
i
go
to
for
example,
the
booking
agents.
obviously,
the
booking
agents
are
important
for
named
bands
and
for
named
bands
that
haven't
had
even
national
reputations
but
local
reputations.
that's
one
of
the
outside
groups
that
i'm
talking
about.
then
i
talk
about
hotels,
nightclubs
and
restaurants.
take
for
example
the
situation
that
prevails
in
new
york
city.
local
802,
every
so
and
so
often
negotiates
with
representatives
of
the
hotels,
nightclubs
and
restaurant
and
presumably,
the
negotiation
is
confined
to
the
employees,
the
hotels,
nightclubs
and
restaurant.
that's
what
it
appears
in
the
surface.
but
your
honors,
that
isn't
true
and
the
facts
in
this
record
are
contradicted
on
that
point.
every
one
of
my
clients
performs
in
one
of
the
other
--
of
hotels
nightclubs
and
restaurants
in
the
city
of
new
york
but
they
must
comply
even
in
single
engagements
with
the
standards,
the
wage
turn
out
--
wages,
house
and
working
conditions,
fixed
by
the
hotels,
nightclub
and
restaurants
and
the
union.
mind
you,
they
were
not
ready
to
these
negotiations
in
anyway.
they
didn't
even
have
notice
on
them
but
the
negotiations
at
that
time
were
now
applied
to
my
clients,
the
same
is
true
of
when
we
say
radio,
television.
the
radio
and
television
contract
is
negotiated
with
the
big
companies.
all
of
the
smaller
companies
then
follow
--
the
union
prints
a
contract
and
they
all
have
to
sign
it
and
when
my
clients
perform
a
single
engagement
and
they
don't
do
it
often,
i
will
admit.
when
my
clients
perform
a
single
engagement
on
radio
or
television,
they
must
comply
with
the
negotiations
--
negotiated
standards
between
the
big
television
or
radio
stations
and
the
--
now,
i
want
to
say
too
your
honors
that
my
complaint
from
the
beginning,
urge
the
fundamental
distinction
between
said
steady
and
single
engagements,
no
other.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honors
can
look
in
vain
through
the
bylaws
of
the
international
or
the
local
to
find
any
reference
to
club-dates.
club-dates
are
just
one
department,
the
largest
department
that
i
would
admit
has
single
engagements
and
when
the
court
below
ruled
on
price
fixing
for
example,
it
did
not
use
the
words
club-date.
it
said
orchestral
engagements
so
that
it
covered
both
single
and
steady
engagements.
now,
it
would
be
easy,
i
think,
on
the
basis
of
this
record
to
be
confused
by
the
fact
that
there
are
--
there
were
testimony
from
a
variety
of
different
types
of
orchestra
leaders.
on
the
union
side,
the
union
did
not
produce
one
single
witness
who
was
a
professional
orchestra
leader,
not
one.
that
is
to
say
one
who
gave
his
full
time
to
being
an
orchestra
leader
never
played
his
assignment,
and
they
are
the
only
people
that
i
represent.
i
don't
have
to
go
into
the
status
of
this
other
margin
of
the
type
of
orchestra
leader
because
i'm
not
concerned
with
them.
my
own
disposition
is
to
believe
that
even
they
are
employers
pro
tonto
but
that's
not
essential
to
my
case
here
and
i
think
that
when
mr.
--
when
judge
friendly
in
his
dissenting
opinion
below
spoke
in
terms
of
interchangeability,
he
was
talking
about
the
kind
of
orchestra
leader
that
i
don't
represent.
i
have
no
doubt
that
max
sanso
who
testified
that
during
the
three
years,
he
had
eight
or
nine
engagements.
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
could
improvise
orchestra
at
any
time
and
that
he
would
be
interchangeable
in
that
with
other
employee
musicians.
that
isn't
the
point.
i'm
talking
about
the
kind
of
orchestra
leader
who
is
the
professional
and
he
is
vastly
different
from
the
employee
sideman
because
he
is
the
risk
taker
in
this
situation.
it
isn't
as
the
--
my
adversary's
briefs
reported
and
that
as
mr.
rosenberg
just
put
it
that
the
usual
procedure
is
for
purchaser
of
music
to
approach
of
musician.
no
your
honors,
the
usual
procedure
is
for
my
clients
to
run
up
telephone
bills
of
$4,000.00
and
$5,000.00
a
year
when
they
read
in
the
newspaper
about
fourth
coming
social
events.
and
they
solicit
and
when
they
have
--
didn't
have
that
kind
of
solicitation,
in
the
end
accumulated
the
kudos
that
comes
with
reputation
then
people
come
to
them
and
call
them
up.
they
never
go
to
my
client's
sideman
and
ask
them
to
get
together
in
orchestra.
and
when
my
client
stands
before
an
orchestra,
they
do
one
or
three
things.
some
of
my
clients
like
charles
peterson
had
never
play
an
instrument.
he
simply
conducts
and
leads
but
most
orchestra
leaders
who
are
in
the
class
of
professional
orchestra
leaders
do
in
fact
play
an
instrument
but
they
play
it
differently
your
honors
than
the
ordinary
sideman.
in
the
first
place,
the
sideman
plays
continuously.
the
orchestra
leader
leads
by
playing.
he
bows
his
head.
he
makes
gestures.
he
gives
emphasis
and
in
that
way,
he
keeps
the
ensemble,
he
denotes
the
tempo
and
so
on
and
he
is
in
charge.
he
is
perfectly
obvious
i
think
to
anyone
that
knows
anything
about
orchestra
performances
that
if
they
were
all
to
play
at
random,
even
the
same
piece,
they
couldn't
even
keep
time.
someone
has
to
be
there
to
lead
them
and
that
is
what
my
clients
do.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
do
they
play
an
instrument?
all
but
peterson.
peterson
does
not
play
an
instrument.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
never
plays
an
instrument.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
oh
yes,
there
are
quite
a
few
of
those.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
some
of
the
most
successful
ones
today,
no
longer
play
an
instrument
and
all
of
my
clients
your
honor,
refused
to
play
an
instrument
when
the
orchestra
is
eight
men
or
more.
if
the
orchestra
that
they
assemble
is
eight
men
or
more
then
they
confine
themselves
only
to
leading
either
with
a
baton
or
with
their
hands.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
i
didn't
say
that
but
it's
practically
true
your
honor
because
whenever
an
events
of
any
kind,
the
required
music
are
arranged
with
the
banquet
manager
of
the
hotel
and
that's
in
the
record
undisputed.
the
banquet
manager
of
the
hotel
tells
them,
you
better
have
only
afm
members
otherwise
you're
going
to
have
later
trouble.
and
in
that
way
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
yes.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
yes,
there
is
a
specific
provision
in
local
802
bylaws
that
says
that
the
executive
board
of
local
802
must
approve
each
orchestra
leader
and
it
reserves
to
itself
the
right
to
cancel
the
contract.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
they
don't
your
honor
have
a
written
agreement
containing
that
verbiage
expressly.
but
that's
the
way
it's
enforced.
in
other
words,
they
do
have
written
agreements
with
the
hotels,
nightclubs
and
restaurants
and
the
hotels,
nightclubs,
and
restaurants
cooperate
with
the
union
by
telling
all
of
their
patrons,
you
must
have
afm
members.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
they
couldn't
get
a
job
as
an
employee
or
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
as
a
leader
--
your
honor,
i
must
say
that
there
are
some
few
cases
where
leaders
are
employees.
i
don't
represent
them
and
i
thought
you're
referring
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
my
clients?
they
--
in
all
probability,
they
could
not
get
a
job
but
there
might
be
some
cases
in
some
hotels
that
are
not
as
careful
about
that
and
wouldn't
object
to
it
but
i
know
that
there's
always
trouble
when
they
don't
belong
to
the
union
and
that's
the
reason
why
two
of
the
plaintiffs
here,
peterson
and
carroll
for
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
some
--
in
some
places,
yes
and
in
some
places,
no.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
no
your
honor.
you
must
understand
that
by
virtue
of
an
agreement
in
front
of
judge
friendly,
my
clients,
peterson
and
carroll
agreed
that
they're
with
the
union,
that
their
orchestras
could
perform
in
this
hotels,
nightclubs
and
restaurants,
provided
carroll
and
peterson
did
not
actually
direct
them
or
play
an
instrument
while
directing
them.
so
that
was
a
provision
of
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
that's
exactly
a
point.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
that's
right.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
yes
your
honor,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
right.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
that's
called
the
hotel
agreement.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
well
your
honor,
the
terms
of
that
agreement
provide
for
example
for
payment
into
a
welfare
fund.
we
have
challenged
the
first
welfare
fund
and
had
been
successful
and
that
having
it
dissolved.
we
are
presently
challenging
the
current
welfare
fund
but
that
case
hasn't
been
decided
yet.
it
hasn't
been
brought
to
trial.
but
one
of
the
terms
of
that
contract
would
be
that
my
clients
must
contribute
to
this
welfare
fund,
negotiated
between
the
hotels
and
my
client
--
and
the
union.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
that
would
be
true
even
if
they're
not
members
of
the
union,
yes
your
honor.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
many
of
the
purchasers
of
music
who
are
admittedly
not
employers
at
all
of
the
sidemen
are
making
contributions
today
to
the
local
802
steady
engagement
welfare
fund.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
not
at
the
present
time
your
honor.
there
was
originally
such
an
agreement
and
i
believe
it
was
brought
after
the
institution
of
our
action
that
that
was
withdrawn.
but
despite
the
fact
that
the
language
is
absent
in
today's
contract,
the
banquet
managers
admitted
when
they
took
the
stand,
we
had
i
believe
five
of
them.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
that's
right?
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
oh
yes.
that
was
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
well
that's
the
minimum
price
which
is
made
at
the
so
called
price
meeting
of
local
802.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
oh
yes
your
honor.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
i
don't
think
that's
quite
a
fair
way
to
point
justice
fortas
--
may
i
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
i
will.
the
price
list

second,
minimums
which
are
minimum
employment
quotas
and
they
too
are
unilaterally
prescribed
by
the
local
802
executive
board.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
well,
that
means
that
for
example
the
grand
ballroom
of
the
waldorf
astoria
hotel
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
--
must
have
12
musicians
including
the
leader,
including
the
leader
because
the
leader
is
counted
i
this
minimum
quotas.
this
is
a
little
different
from
the
average
case
where
a
union's
bylaws,
fixes
regulations
for
minimum
quotas.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
the
third
one
is
the
leader's
money.
that
is
to
say
for
clients
like
mine
will
always
have
three
or
more
musicians
at
least.
that
means
they
get
double
--
they
must
get
double
the
money
that
the
sideman
gets
for
what
is
called
the
leaders
fee
and
they
have
no
right
to
waive
that.
they
may
not
wave
it
but
it
will
be
brought
up
on
charges
if
they
waive
it.
the
fourth
is
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
the
leaders
will
be
brought
up
on
charges.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
well,
yes
in
one
sense
only.
i
have
had
cases
where
my
clients
were
expelled
from
the
union
and
i
thought,
well,
exposure
from
the
union
meant
that
they
were
no
longer
members
but
they
were
brought
up
on
charges
nevertheless
as
expelled
members.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
the
fourth
one,
cartage
fees.
for
example,
a
double
base
is
a
bulky
instrument
and
therefore,
a
certain
amount
of
extra
charge
for
that.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
the
fifth
is
mileage
fees.
now,
here's
something
that's
very
distinctive.
if
my
client
ben
cutler
who
is
nationally
known
as
an
orchestra
leader,
books
for
engagements
in
chicago,
he
must
book
that
each
one
of
those
engagements
have
the
price
indicated
by
these
ingredients
i'm
describing.
but
obviously,
the
mileage
fee
is
only
taken
care
of
once
because
you
try
to
go
there
only
once
and
play
four
engagements
and
come
back.
but
the
union
regulation
requires
that
you
multiply
the
mileage
fee
four
times
so
that
each
one
of
the
persons
for
whom
he
performs
must
play
the
mileage
fee.
the
next
is
the
8%
surcharge
which
the
union
explained
as
something
does
defray
the
bookkeeping
cost
and
the
social
security
and
so
on.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
that's
paid
to
the
leader.
he
must
charge
that
to
his
purchaser
of
music.
the
seventh
is
lodge,
i
mean
that
uniforms
where
he
does
require
them.
the
eighth
is
food
and
lodging
according
to
certain
standards
fixed
by
the
union.
the
ninth
is
transportation
costs
which
are
supposed
to
be
according
to
the
form
b
contract
and
i
might
say
here
that
the
union
prescribes
the
form
of
a
contract
that
my
client
as
a
businessman
and
employer
must
use
in
dealing
with
his
purchasing.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
the
tenth
is
the
10%
traveling
surcharge
up
to
a
certain
point
in
the
beginning
of
1964,
and
that
was
a
10%
addendum
to
the
price
because
of
traveling.
but
now,
it
is
called
the
10%
wage
differential.
and
of
that,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
is
a
price
differential
in
actuality.
and
the
eleventh
is
the
contribution
to
the
welfare
program.
now,
these
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
that's
--
that's
all
of
them,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
the
union
--
i
don't
know
how
to
answer
that,
your
honor
because
during
the
trial,
the
union
attorney
took
the
position
that
the
words
‘price'
and
‘wage'
were
interchangeable.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
i
think
some
of
them
pertain
to
price.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
right,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
surely.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
yes
your
honor,
when
the
--
when
the
hotel
hires
him.
but
if
one
of
the
customers
of
the
hotel,
that
is
to
say,
one
of
the
--
some
association
who
wants
to
run
a
dinner
dance,
then
he
--
then
the
association
must
be
charged
with
this
amount.
and
the
witnesses
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
no,
no,
by
my
client
in
that
case.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
well,
i
--
i
took
about
four
pages
i
believe
in
my
reply
brief
to
try
to
distinguish
the
oliver
case
and
i
take
the
position
personally
that
it
is
not
relevant
here.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
oh,
i
don't
think
that
you
--
you
can
merely
baptize
these
items
as
wages
and
then
say,
you
see,
it's
nothing
but
a
wage
question.
i
think
you
have
to
be
realistic.
this
is
a
matter
of
--
of
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
well,
i
would
say
that
for
example,
some
of
those
items
are
clearly
part
of
pricing
and
some
are
wages.
for
instance,
the
unilaterally
prescribed
wages,
i
can't
say
that
that's
part
of
--
that's
pricing
as
such,
but
i
do
object
to
the
manner
in
which
they
do
it.
they
unilaterally
prescribe
the
wages
but
when
you
have
leader's
money,
when
you
have
the
8%
surcharge,
when
you
have
the
cartage,
when
you
have
the
minimum
quota
of
employer
--
employees
where
the
minimum
quota
includes
the
employer
himself,
then
i
say
these
are
all
ingredients
of
price
and
not
of
wage.
that's
what
i
mentioned,
your
honor.
now,
i
might
say
too
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
significant
question
on
the
item
of
whether
or
not
my
em
--
my
clients
are
employers
and
every
one
of
the
people
i
called,
every
single
one
of
them
testified
in
effect
that
my
clients
were
employers,
but
the
significant
question
is
not
whether
these
employers
do
certain
things
which
are
similar
to
things
done
by
the
union.
they're
not
exactly
the
same
because
by
that
token,
a
glassblower
employer,
an
electrician
employer,
any
kind
of
employer,
including
the
president
of
general
motors,
he
certainly
does
certain
things
that
some
employees
can
do
or
does
certain
things
that
are
similar
to
what
employees
do.
the
important
question
is,
are
they
businessmen
with
independent
businesses
and
are
they
employers?
and
i
say
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
contradict
the
repeated
testimony
that
my
clients
are
employers
and
independent
businessmen.
now,
we
come
to
the
--
another
question,
and
that
is
a
strain
that
goes
through
all
of
my
adversaries'
briefs.
they
keep
talking
about
job
and
wage
competition,
and
this
was
true
in
--
during
the
trial
constantly,
but
no
one,
including
the
courts
below
or
my
adversaries
ever
took
the
trouble
to
analyze
precisely
what
is
meant
by
competition
in
these
circumstances.
and
as
i
see
it,
there
are
only
seven
possibilities.
first
of
all,
the
competitors
must
necessarily
be,
if
i
understand
them
correctly,
orchestra
leaders
like
my
clients
who
are
entrepreneurs,
and
employee
musicians
who
are
union
members.
those
are
the
two
competing
bodies.
now,
for
what
can
it
be
realistically
stated
they
compete?
well,
it's
conceivable
that
these
two
would
compete
for
jobs
as
leaders,
and
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
union
that
should
have
any
right
to
regulate
whether
a
sideman
should
compete
for
a
job
as
a
leader,
or
any
association
of
leaders
to
regulate
whether
a
sideman
should
compete
as
leaders.
and
incidentally,
justice
white,
there
is
an
association
here,
a
national
association
of
orchestra
leaders,
and
they
do
not
fix
prices.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
well
your
honor,
if
i
can
approximate
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
that's
right
because
--
because
we
did
have
one
session
between
the
representatives
of
the
national
association
of
orchestra
leaders
and
this
union,
and
one
of
the
things
that
we
told
them
we
couldn't
do
with
them
is
fixed
prices,
which
they
wanted
to
do.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
well,
if
it
--
if
the
--
i
don't
believe
it
is
really
a
collective
bargain
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
if
--
it
might
serve
the
same
purpose
but
you
certainly
not
arrive
at
the
same
way.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
because
my
clients
have
no
word
in
it.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
you
understand.
well,
as
i
say,
competition
for
jobs
as
leaders
is
really
nothing
except
competition
for
entry
into
the
ranks
of
employers,
and
i
don't
think
any
union
or
any
employee
association
has
the
right
to
close
the
door
on
that.
the
second
type
of
competition
would
be
for
jobs
as
sub-leaders.
now,
i
might
say
that
a
sub-leader
is
a
kind
of
supervisory
employee
musician
who
takes
over
the
direction
and
control
of
an
orchestra
when
the
employer
himself
can't
attend.
this
institution
of
sub-leaders
is
very
limited
throughout
the
united
states.
i
suppose
it
has
its
greatest
scope
in
the
city
of
new
york.
but
in
boston,
philadelphia
and
chicago,
i
think
there
are
a
few.
but
they
are
definitely
supervisors
within
the
meaning
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
my
opinion,
and
i
have
always
taken
the
position
that
if
congress
saw
it
fit
to
exclude
from
the
bargaining
unit
or
from
the
union
that
has
organized
the
employees,
the
supervisor
afore
certiorari,
then
employers
like
my
clients
should
not
be
in
the
union.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
they
supervise
the
conduct
of
the
particular
engagement.
they
conduct
the
orchestra.
they
watch
to
it
--
they
see
to
it
that
all
of
the
amenities
of
social
intercourse
are
observed.
if
an
orchestra
leader
--
orchestra
member
were
to
become
drunk,
they
have
the
power
of
firing
right
on
the
spot
or
order
him
home.
you
know,
they
stand
in
the
place
of
the
leader
during
the
performance.
the
third
kind
of
competition
would
be
for
--
for
jobs
as
sub-leaders.
now
--
i
mean,
for
jobs
as
sidemen.
it
should
be
obvious
that
professional
orchestra
leaders
who
command
much
more
of
income
than
either
sub-leaders
or
sidemen
are
not
competing
for
jobs
as
sub-leaders
or
as
sidemen.
my
clients
--
there
was
no
evidence
whatever
in
this
record
to
show
that
my
clients
ever
competed
for
jobs
as
sidemen
or
as
sub-leaders.
and
that
could
be
competition
for
musical
engagement
contracts.
that
would
be
more
or
less
in
the
way
of
acting
as
a
broker
or
a
man
says
i'll
--
i'll
get
you
the
band
or
give
me
the
contract
and
i'll
see
that
the
performance
is
carried
out
alright.
but
he
himself
is
neither
a
musician
or
if
he
is,
he
doesn't
perform.
that
kind
of
competition
wasn't
mentioned
in
our
record.
the
four
--
the
fifth
is
competition
for
the
income
of
professional
leaders.
and
again,
that
--
there
was
no
mention
of
that
in
any
part
of
the
record.
the
sixth,
well,
competition
for
wages
of
sub-leaders,
supervisors
not
mentioned
at
all
in
the
record,
and
seventh,
competition
for
wages
to
sidemen.
my
clients
never
competed
for
wages
of
sidemen,
but
there
was
no
evidence
of
that
up
to
that
point
at
all.
now,
i
think
that
it's
important
to
emphasize
briefly
that
judge
levet
at
the
trial
court,
when
he
talked
about
named
bands
assumed
that
named
bands
had
to
be
organizations
of
national
reputation.
i
submit
that
the
evidence
in
the
record
here
is
undisputed
that
a
man
can
have
a
named
band
in
the
city
of
great
new
york
or
in
the
environs
of
new
york
and
not
being
known
in
washington.
so
that
the
whole
question
of
name
is
a
very
relative
thing,
except
that
there
are
indeed
a
20
or
30
named
bands
that
command
towering
prices
and
great
audiences,
and
they
are
known
to
practically
everybody.
a
question
was
asked
about
whether
--
if
one
of
my
clients
were
to
come
to
washington
and
play
an
engagement
here
with
his
orchestra,
he
would
be
subject
to
filing
requirements
here
with
the
local
here.
the
answer
is
of
course
yes.
in
other
words,
he
would
have
to
file
his
contract
for
a
single
engagement
here
in
washington
and
the
local
here
in
washington
reserves
the
right
not
to
approve
it.
and
if
the
union
here
does
not
approve
it,
he
simply
can't
play
here.
this
is
done
regularly.
and
the
territorial
restrictions
are
very
numerous
that
are
imposed
unilaterally
by
this
union
and
abided
by
all
of
these
outsiders.
for
example,
one
of
the
provisions
in
the
bylaws
is
that
since
our
institution
of
the
suit
has
been
eliminated
was
a
provision
which
actually
told
the
leader
that
he
had
no
right
to
borrow
money
to
advance
the
business
of
his
own
orchestra
unless
he
got
the
permission
of
the
president
of
the
international.
then
of
course,
if
one
of
my
clients
were
to
book
an
--
a
steady
engagement
in
chicago,
for
example,
he
would
not
be
allowed
to
book
any
single
engagement
during
the
period
of
that
engagement
and
he
would
not
be
allowed
to
book
it
for
a
period
of
five
days
before
or
five
days
after.
and
he
couldn't
even
book
it
if
he
booked
it
during
that
period
to
be
performed
six
months
later.
and
many
of
the
locals
with
the
approval
of
the
international
seek
to
protect
the
local
musician,
the
local
orchestra
leader
from
competition
by
orchestra
leaders
who
invade.
and
of
course,
the
--
one
of
the
most
important
territorial
rules
is
that
whenever
one
of
my
clients
comes
from
new
york
and
visits
another
jurisdiction
where
the
prices
and
the
wages
are
lower,
my
client
is
bound
by
the
higher
of
the
two.
in
other
words,
since
the
local
802
rates
are
generally
speaking
throughout
the
united
states
the
highest
rates
in
the
industry,
my
client,
if
he
goes
to
newark,
new
jersey
for
example,
must
compete
with
local
musicians
there
on
the
basis
of
the
higher
new
york
prices
against
the
lower
newark
prices.
the
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
oh
no,
your
honor,
because
many
of
the
price
fixing
lists
appear
right
in
the
--
the
bylaws
of
the
afm
itself.
if
your
honors
were
to
examine
the
bylaws
as
they
prevail
at
that
time,
you
would
see
all
sorts
of
prices,
not
wages,
prices
fixed
for
also
--
for
instance,
at
a
carnival
or
a
rodeo
or
something
like
that.
now,
since
that
time,
the
latest
bylaws
that
i've
observed
has
kind
of
circumvented
that
difficulty
by
saying
write
to
the
office
of
the
president
for
the
prices
on
this,
and
they're
not
set
forth.
but
the
point
is
that
they
are
nationally
fixed
in
some
industries,
radio
and
television
being
a
pair
of
them.
the
--
i
want
to
make
sure
that
i
answered
justice
black's
question
continuously
now,
and
that
is
we
claim
that
the
violations
of
the
--
of
the
sherman
act
take
place
in
the
following
ways.
one,
all
of
our
locals
here,
all
of
the
afm
locals
and
the
afm
itself
have
regulations
which
impose
obligations
on
all
members,
including
orchestra
leader
employers,
that
they
can
never
compete
at
prices
below
the
prices
fixed
by
the
respective
locals
or
by
the
international.
they
--
article
25
of
the
afm
bylaws
requires
every
booking
agent
to
get
a
license
before
he
can
operate
as
a
booking
agent.
and
it
also
forbids
any
orchestra
leader
to
make
use
of
the
services
of
a
booking
agent
unless
he
is
licensed
by
the
afm.
now,
the
afm
reserves
the
right
to
vacate
the
license
of
the
booking
agent
for
a
good
reason,
a
bad
reason,
or
no
reason
at
all,
and
without
notice.
and
it
requires
the
booking
agent
to
sign
a
contract
that
he
will
--
all
his
negotiations
observe
the
bylaws
of
the
federation
and
of
the
local
involved.
and
finally,
the
--
one
of
the
most
effective
means
used
here
for
violating
the
sherman
act
is
the
use
of
the
form
b
contract.
now,
i
might
say
that
since
this
trial,
local
802,
because
of
the
constant
thunder
of
criticism
that
we
leveled
at
the
form
b
contract,
to
which
i'll
come
in
a
minute,
has
dropped
that
form
b
contract
and
published
another.
the
other
one
made
explicit
what
was
implicit
in
the
form
b
contract.
so
we
immediately
moved
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
an
injunction
against
it
because
it
fixed
prices
and
we
obtain
that.
thank
you.
may
it
please
the
court.
one
of
the
indications
of
the
matter
in
which
professional
leaders
garner
most
of
the
important
business
was
provided
by
one
--
three
exhibits
introduced
by
the
defendants
themselves,
defendants'
exhibits
l,
m
and
n.
and
one
of
those
three
showed
for
example
that
4.9%
of
the
persons
who
filed
contracts
as
leaders
had
gathered
into
their
business
52.4%
of
all
of
the
contracts
for
engagements
signed.
the
status
of
my
clients
as
employers,
contrary
to
what
the
district
court
found
without
the
benefit
of
any
evidence
in
the
record,
remained
the
same
even
when
they
play
on
radio
and
television,
or
when
they
do
recordings.
certainly,
it
should
be
obvious
that
a
named
band
leader
for
example
doesn't
change
his
status
as
employer
simply
because
he
makes
a
recording
with
his
own
musicians.
it
is
true
nevertheless
that
very
few
records
are
today
made
by
orchestras
as
such.
the
day
of
the
big
band
has
somewhat
receded.
but
whenever
my
clients,
like
for
instance,
sye
zetna,
one
of
them
--
he
made
--
i've
forgotten
how
many
albums.
whenever
he
performed,
he
performed
with
his
men
so
that
his
status
didn't
change.
and
hank
thompson
and
another
one
who
testified,
he's
one
of
the
leaders
in
the
field
of
country
music,
he
was
required
at
one
time
by
the
union
rules
and
by
--
by
the
recording
company
that
was
enforcing
the
union
rules
to
stop
the
system
under
which
he
was
getting
a
lump
sum
of
money.
and
now,
the
recording
company
advanced
out
of
his
royalties
moneys
to
pay
the
employees,
so
that
the
money
went
only
because
of
union
rules
from
the
insure
--
from
the
recording
company
to
his
employees
to
give
the
appearance
that
the
recording
company
is
the
employer,
but
it
was
subtracted
from
his
royalties.
i
am
challenging
those
findings
of
the
court
below
that
deal
with
competition.
i
say
there's
no
evidence
to
show
that
there's
competition.
and
also,
those
findings
of
the
court
below
that
say
that
my
clients
suddenly
lose
their
status
as
employer
or
businessmen
when
they
do
recordings
or
do
tv
appearances
or
television
appearance
because
i
say
there's
absolutely
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
substantiate
their
loss
of
their
status.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
your
honor,
i
specified
them
in
more
--
in
my
brief
somewhere,
but
i
don't
remember
the
number
offhand.
now,
i
referred
before
to
the
form
b
contract.
the
form
b
contract
not
only
is
the
result
of
a
mandate
from
the
bylaws
of
the
afm
but
it
is
a
mandate
that
is
pure
fiction
and
misrepresentation
in
significant
parts.
for
example,
the
orchestra
leader
who
makes
use
of
a
form
b
contract
is
required
to
acknowledge
by
his
signature
that
he
is
not
the
employer
but
rather
the
employee
of
the
purchaser
of
the
music.
and
yet,
that's
done
as
a
matter
of
form
without
any
relation
to
reality.
also,
the
form
b
contract
incorporates
by
reference
all
of
the
afm
bylaws
and
the
local
bylaws,
and
it
contains
the
fiction
for
example
that
the
purchaser
of
the
music
hires
the
sidemen
in
the
orchestra
through
the
agency
of
the
leader.
then,
one
of
the
things
that's
incorporated
by
reference
has
a
particular
bearing
upon
traveling
engagements.
you
can
understand
that
if
an
orchestra
travels
from
place
to
place,
they
--
if
he
visits
chicago
for
example
and
then
goes
to
san
francisco,
the
chicago
local
won't
be
able
to
have
jurisdiction
over
him
to
file
charges
of
any
kind.
well,
in
those
cases,
the
federation,
the
international
takes
care
of
all
the
charges
and
processes
them
and
adjudicates
them
by
means
of
the
international
executive
board.
and
if
there
are
any
fines,
as
there
sometimes
are,
the
fines
go
into
the
treasury
of
the
international,
the
very
organization
that
is
adjudicating
the
case
under
a
pseudo-arbitration
system.
the
purchaser
of
the
music,
even
though
he
is
not
the
purchaser
in
the
ordinary
sense,
is
sometimes
subjected
to
union
boycotts
and
threats
in
this
way.
if
an
orchestra
leader
is
not
a
member
of
the
union
or
if
he
charges
less
than
the
minimum
price
prescribed
by
the
union
and
he
does
that
in
x
dancehall
in
oshkosh,
then
that
x
dancehall
is
now
put
on
an
unfair
list
and
no
other
person
belonging
to
the
union,
whether
employer
or
employee,
is
permitted
to
perform
there
until
he's
taken
off
that
list.
and
of
course,
i
don't
know
whether
i
stressed
before
that
no
booking
agent
is
allowed
to
book
for
any
musician
unless
he
belongs
to
the
afm
or
one
of
its
locals.
i'd
conclude
with
this
quotation
from
the
pennington
case
and
with
a
suggestion
that
what
was
left
to
speculation
and
hypothesis
in
the
pennington
case
is
the
case
that's
actually
presented
to
your
honors
today.
if
the
umw,
in
this
case,
in
order
to
protect
its
weight
scale
by
maintaining
employer
income
had
presented
a
set
of
prices
at
which
the
mine
operators
would
be
required
to
sell
their
coal,
the
union
and
the
employers
who
happened
to
agree
could
not
successfully
defend
this
contract
provision
if
it
were
challenged
under
the
anti-trust
laws
by
the
united
states
or
by
somebody
injured
by
the
arrangement.
that's
the
quotation,
and
that
is
exactly
the
case
we
have
here
because
price
lists,
as
the
president
of
the
local
--
of
the
international
admitted,
are
universal.
every
single
local
of
the
683
locals
of
the
federation
have
their
own
price
lists.
and
the
federation
itself
has
its
price
lists
on
national
problems.
thank
you,
your
honors.
