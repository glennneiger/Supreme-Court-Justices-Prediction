to
be
included
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
even
on
the
assumption
that
we
are
making
in
this
case
that
these
leaders
--
these
plaintiff
leaders
here
are
independent
businessman
and
not
employees
and
that
the
union
and
these
leaders
as
independent
businessman
have
in
effect
agreed
to
that
--
that
the
wages
on
the
road
or
the
price
that
the
leaders
will
charge
on
the
road
will
be
higher?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
wouldn't
suggest
for
a
minute
that
there
is
--
that
if
you
assume
that
these
independent
leaders
are
--
these
leaders
are
independent
businessmen
and
not
employees,
what
you
have
here
is
an
arrangement
between
the
union
and
some
employers.
i
don't
know
how
else
you
can
talk
about
it.
you
can
say,
well,
they
didn't
agree,
we
just
coerced
them
into
it
but
you
really
don't
--
do
you
really
seriously
contend
that
for
purposes
of
section
one
that
this
isn't
a
combination?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
can
you
if
you
assume
these
gentlemen
are
quite
willing
to
assume
in
this
case
that
these
leaders
are
independent
businessmen.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wait
a
minute.
that's
another
question.
i
understand
that
you're
relying
on
the
exemption.
i'm
not
for
a
minute
asking
you
to
concede
that
this
violates
antitrust
laws.
i'm
just
asking
a
plain
simple
question
if
this
is
a
combination
for
a
purpose
of
analysis
under
section
1.
if
it
isn't,
you
don't
even
either
get
to
your
exemption.
if
it
is,
you
do
need
to
and
as
i
understand
that
you're
relying
on
your
exemption.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
that's
the
part
of
spelling
out
your
exemption
saying
that,
well
there
are
independent
businessmen
that
will
treat
them
as
a
labor
group
rather
than
a
non-labor
group
because
the
exemption
requires
this
too.
but
you're
suggesting
though
that
the
union
may
take
these
independent
businessmen
and
agree
with
them
to
have
this
differential
on
the
road
and
this
territorial
restriction.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
part
of
the
exemption,
opens
the
labor
union.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
do
you
justify
the
agreement
broke
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
the
union
agrees
with
them
to
pay
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that
the
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
about
the
agreement
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
an
agreement
that
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
as
i
understand
what
you
said
earlier
that
even
if
he
is
a
member
of
the
union,
we
are
approaching
this
case
on
the
assumption
whether
it's
true
or
false.
we
are
pushing
on
the
assumption
that
the
leader,
these
plaintiff
leaders
are
independent
businessmen.
they
are
not
employees
of
anybody.
now
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
what
would
you
say
if
the
independent
--
this
so
called
independent
leaders
who
lead
all
the
time
and
never
they
play.
what
if
these
gentlemen
have
formed
an
association
of
the
association
of
independent
leaders
and
they
have
arranged
to
set
their
prices
that
they
were
going
to
charge
to
those
who
purchase
music
and
they
did
have
an
agreement
like
this
among
themselves.
what
about
that
under
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
these
same,
now
wait
a
minute,
these
same
independent
businessmen
can
exempt
that
can
have
this
sort
of
an
agreement
exempted
nearly
by
joining
the
union.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
union
can
exempt
by
having
them
join
them,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
let's
the
association
that
i
talked
about.
association
of
independent
leaders,
they
formed
an
arrangement
among
themselves
to
set
prices
that
they
would
charge
for
purchases
of
music
and
on
this
side,
they
went
to
the
union
and
said,
“look,
this
is
our
--
this
are
our
prices.
is
this
alright
with
you?”
and
the
union
said,
“fine.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
would
like
to
regulate
your
prices
very
much.”
so
they
have
an
independent
agreement
between
the
union
and
this
association
of
independent
businessmen
to
set
prices.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
what
would
you
say
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
were
agreeing
there
with
an
employer,
you
didn't
permit
and
attempt
to
--
attempt
to
tell
the
employer
you're
making
a
collective
bargaining
contract
with
what
he's
going
to
sell
his
merchandise
for.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could've
agreed
with
him
what
his
labor
cost
was
going
to
be
or
what
some
of
his
applied
cost
are
going
to
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
element
purchase
sales
price
for
public
was
going
to
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
doesn't
have
to
be
what
you're
doing
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
your
clients
in
this
case
play
instruments?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
peterson
leads
all
the
time,
he
never
plays
an
instrument.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
have
to
at
least
get
phase
up
to
the
professional
leader
who
never
plays.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
at
least
know
whether
or
not
you're
any
of
your
--
your
clients
have
been
expelled
from
the
union.
have
they
been
playing
in
new
york
nightclubs
and
hotels
since
they've
been
expelled
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
must
not
be
any,
any
flat
rule
that
leaders
who
aren't
members
of
the
union
may
not
get
an
engagement
in
a
new
york
hotel.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
they
could
never
lead
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
could
book
the
engagement
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
but
they
have
to
hire
a
leader.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
would
suppose
the
union
would
claim
that
if
that
national
association
wanted
to
bargain
with
the
union
or
the
union
wanted
to
bargain
with
that
national
association,
that
they
could
bargain
and
execute
a
collective
bargaining
contract
in
which
the
wage
is
to
be
paid
by
the
members
of
the
association
to
the
sideman,
etcetera,
would
be
--
could
be
fixed.
and
i
would
suppose
they
would
have
to
claim
since
their
claim
in
this
case
in
effect
that
is
part
of
that
collective
bargaining
contract,
the
association
and
the
union
could
agree
as
to
what
the
ultimate
crisis
the
members
of
the
association
would
charge
for
single
engagements
or
extended
engagement.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
that
claim
wouldn't
be
any
different
than
what
it
is
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
--
it
seems
to
me
like
membership
in
the
union
is
by
independent
businessmen
--
independent
leaders
is
really
in
effect
the
collective
bargaining
contract
between
them
and
the
union.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
serves
the
same
purpose.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
interest
of
the
union
in
specifying
that
the
leader
--
leader's
compensation
shall
be
twice
that
of
the
sub-leader?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
think
that's
at
least
but
relevant.
let's
assume
that
here's
a
leader
that
doesn't
play
no
instrument
whatsoever
and
he's
a
professional
leader.
and
then,
the
thing
of
it
is
that
he
has
two
engagements
at
one
time.
now,
he
hires
a
leader,
a
sub-leader
to
take
one
off
him
and
the
other
one
is
leading
himself.
now,
what
interest
does
the
union
get
in
saying
that
the
leader's
compensation
in
the
--
on
the
engagement
where
he's
conducting
himself
should
be
twice
that
of
what
the
sub-leader's
compensation
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what's
the
union's
interest
in
saying
that
it
must
be
twice?
why
shouldn't
the
union
be
satisfied
with
saying
that
the
leader
when
he
conducts
himself,
should
at
least
get
at
least
what
a
sub-leader
would
get.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
just
saying
that
--
i
say
this
is
a
situation
where
the
leader
doesn't
play
at
all.
he
plays
no
instrument
whatsoever.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
is
it
the
union
attempt
to
regulate
what
this
fellow
--
what
the
leader
charges
for
his
efforts
in
managing
the
orchestra,
getting
the
engagement
and
supervising
the
whole
affair?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
in
price
competition
--
price
competition
in
an
industry,
sever
price
competition
inevitably
is
going
to
put
pressure
below,
isn't
it?
but
any
industry,
stiff
competition
in
the
automobile
industry,
i
suppose
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
would
be
harder
for
the
industry
to
raise
wages
or
to
keep
wages.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
would
say
that
the
union
would
have
an
interest
in
setting
the
prices
of
automobiles?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
he's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
including
these
equal
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
be
included
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
even
on
the
assumption
that
we
are
making
in
this
case
that
these
leaders
--
these
plaintiff
leaders
here
are
independent

and
not

and
that
the
union
and
these
leaders
as
independent
businessman
have
in
effect
agreed
to
that
--
that
the
wages
on
the
road
or
the
price
that
the
leaders
will
charge
on
the
road
will
be
higher?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
wouldn't
suggest
for
a
minute
that
there
is
--
that
if
you
assume
that
these
independent
leaders
are
--
these
leaders
are
independent
businessmen
and
not
employees,
what
you
have
here
is
an
arrangement
between
the
union
and
some
employers.
i
don't
know
how
else
you
can
talk
about
it.
you
can
say,
well,
they
didn't
agree,
we
just

another

relying
on

i'm
not
for

asking
you
to

i'm
just
asking
a
plain
simple
question
if
this
is
a

for
a
purpose
of
analysis
under
section
1.
if
it
isn't,
you
don't
even
either
get

if
it
is,
you
do
need
to
and
as
i
understand
that
you're
relying
on
your
exemption.
justice
byron

white
i
know,
but
that's
the
part
of
spelling
out
your

saying
that,
well
there
are
independent

that
will
treat

let's
the

etcetera,
would
be
--
could
be
fixed.
and
i
would
suppose
they
would
have
to
claim
since
their
claim
in
this
case
in
effect
that
is
part
of
that
collective
bargaining
contract,
the
association
and
the
union
could
agree
as
to
what
the
ultimate
crisis
the
members
of
the
association
would
charge
for
single
engagements
or
extended
engagement.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
that
claim
wouldn't
be
any
different
than
what
it
is
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
--
it
seems
to
me
like
membership
in
the
union
is
by
independent
businessmen
--
independent
leaders
is
really
in
effect
the
collective
bargaining
contract
between
them
and
the
union.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
serves
the
same
purpose.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
interest
of
the
union
in
specifying
that
the
leader
--
leader's
compensation
shall
be
twice
that
of
the
sub-leader?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
think
that's
at
least
but
relevant.
let's
assume
that
here's
a
leader
that
doesn't
play
no
instrument
whatsoever
and
he's
a
professional
leader.
and
then,
the
thing
of
it
is
that
he
has
two
engagements
at
one
time.
now,
he
hires
a
leader,
a
sub-leader
to
take
one
off
him
and
the
other
one
is
leading
himself.
now,
what
interest
does
the
union
get
in
saying
that
the
leader's
compensation
in
the
--
on
the
engagement
where
he's
conducting
himself
should
be
twice
that
of
what
the
sub-leader's
compensation
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what's
the
union's
interest
in
saying
that
it
must
be
twice?
why
shouldn't
the
union
be
satisfied
with
saying
that
the
leader
when
he
conducts
himself,
should
at
least
get
at
least
what
a
sub-leader
would
get.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
just
saying
that
--
i
say
this
is
a
situation
where
the
leader
doesn't
play
at
all.
he
plays
no
instrument
whatsoever.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
is
it
the
union
attempt
to
regulate
what
this
fellow
--
what
the
leader
charges
for
his
efforts
in
managing
the
orchestra,
getting
the
engagement
and
supervising
the
whole
affair?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
in
price
competition
--
price
competition
in
an
industry,
sever
price
competition
inevitably
is
going
to
put
pressure
below,
isn't
it?
but
any
industry,
stiff
competition
in
the
automobile
industry,
i
suppose
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
would
be
harder
for
the
industry
to
raise
wages
or
to
keep
wages.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
would
say
that
the
union
would
have
an
interest
in
setting
the
prices
of
automobiles?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
he's
right.
