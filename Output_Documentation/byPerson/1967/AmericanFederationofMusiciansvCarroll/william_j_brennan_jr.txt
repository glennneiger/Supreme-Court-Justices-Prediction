justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
suppose
these
leaders
were
not
in
fact
members
of
the
union,
would
you
still
be
making
the
argument
you
are
today?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
if
they
were
not
members
of
the
union.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
say
mr.
schmidt
that
none
of
your
clients
could
get
an
engagement
in
a
hotel,
nightclub
and
so
forth
in
new
york
city
unless
he
is
a
member
of
the
union,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
what
do
they
say?
you
have
to
make
your
piece
mr.
--
speaking
not
only
of
your
clients.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
leader,
you
have
to
be
satisfied
to
the
union
before
we
can
employ.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
what
about
the
--
does
this
union
here
have
an
agreement
with
any
hotel
to
the
effect
that
the
hotel
will
hire
orchestras
only
if
the
leader
and
the
members
are
--
members
that
are
associate
--
affiliated
with
the
union.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
i
gathered
that
your
clients
are
the
ones
who
have
been
expelled
from
the
union
could
never
get
a
job
with
a
new
york
hotel.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
as
a
leader.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
your
clients,
your
clients.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
this
negotiation
that
you
said
earlier
mr.
schmidt?
it
wasn't
even
that
was
going
on
--
you
said,
i
thought
was
not
even
known
to
your
clients.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
was
altered
in
an
agreement.
now
what
is
this
agreement
you're
talking
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
is
it?
what
terms
of
that
agreement
have
any
bearing
in
the
issues
we
have
here
today?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
must
make
that
contribution
even
though
they
are
not
member
of
the
union?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
--
is
there
anything
at
all
in
the
agreement?
i
gathered
what
you
said
to
justice
white
a
few
minutes
ago
that
there
is
not
just
to
be
sure.
is
there
anything
at
all
in
the
agreement
by
which
the
banquet
manager
of
the
hotel
agrees
that
he
will
not
employ
as
--
or
purchase
music
through
a
leader
who
is
not
a
member
of
the
union?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
as
a
practice
that's
where
it
works.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
my
next
question
is,
is
there
anything
at
all
in
the
agreement
which
--
by
which
the
banquet
manager
agrees
that
he
shall
pay
a
certain
minimum
price?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
even
if
one
of
your
clients
is
willing
to
take
the
job
for
something
less,
this
requires
your
client
to
take
the
price
that's
specified
in
the
agreement
of
the
union
with
the
hotels?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wait
a
minute,
who
will
be
brought
up
on
charges?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
they're
not
members
of
the
union?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
let
me
get
it
clear,
mr.
schmidt.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
telling
us
that
in
new
york
city,
one
of
your
clients
who's
offered
and
engagement
at
any
hotel
or
night
club
that
is
a
party
to
this
agreement
with
the
union
has
to
take
from
the
hotel,
whether
he
wants
that
much
or
not,
a
sum
of
money
which
is
the
total
of
all
those
items.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
the
association
must
be
charged
this
amount
by
the
hotel,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
what
label
would
you
use,
mr.
schmidt?
