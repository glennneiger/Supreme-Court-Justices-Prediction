justice
abe
fortas
are
those
functions
always
performed
by
the
same
men
that
it
say
as
the
man
who
obtains
the
engagement
always
the
leader?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
it
might
be
performed
by
somebody
else
too,
might
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
what
you're
telling
me
is
that
the
man
--
if
the
man
who
obtains
engagement
play
at
a
particular
club-date
and
he
will
always
--
he
will
always
be
the
leader
i
suppose.
that
means
select
some
music
and
determine
some
tempo
and
so
on,
is
that
what
you're
telling
me?
justice
abe
fortas
why
do
you
say
is
an
employer?
who
pays
the
sideman?
justice
abe
fortas
i
must
assume
that
you
are
aware
of
that
--
that
point
maybe
the
utmost
importance
in
the
decision
of
this
case.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
follow
you
there
that
is,
i
assume
that
you
are
making
a
concession
of
counsel
that
this
case
can
be
decided
on
the
basis
that
the
leader
is
the
employer.
justice
abe
fortas
so
there's
no
issue
of
fact
on
that
both
sides
i
assume
to
take
a
position
that
the
leader
is
the
employer
that
as
if
it
were
a
stipulated
fact
for
us
isn't
it?
why
would
we
have
to
remand
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you're
not
--
you
either
have
to
say
that
you
are
conceding
the
point
or
you're
not
conceding
the
point
and
which
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but
suppose
--
suppose
you
have
somebody
though
who
doesn't
know
how
to
play
an
instrument
at
all
but
it
is
a
--
but
he
gets
engagements,
he
books
engagements
and
he
hires
musicians
to
go
out
and
play
them.
now
do
you
concede
that
the
--
that
wouldn't
--
it
would
not
be
appropriate
for
the
union
to
admit
or
require
membership
of
that
sort
of
a
person?
justice
abe
fortas
there
are
such
persons
in
existence.
i
don't
recall
what
the
finding
say
but
take
that
and
take
that
illustration.
justice
abe
fortas
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
your
theory
which
is
what
i'm
interested
in
here.
are
you
saying
only
that
where
the
same
individual
books
the
engagement
and
plays
an
instrument
or
leads
the
--
or
as
present
and
leads
without
playing
the
instrument
that
in
that
situation
and
that
situation
only,
you
contend
that
it's
proper
for
the
unlawful
and
not
a
violation
with
antitrust
laws
toward
the
union
to
admit
him
to
membership
and
to
impose
its
regulations
on
him?
are
you
confining
yourself
to
that
restricted
class
and
then
affect
conceding
that
if
the
person
who
books
the
engagement
and
rounds
up
the
musicians
is
not
an
instrumentalist
and
doesn't
play
or
is
not
present
and
actually
conducting
the
instrumentalist
then
he
is
not
eligible
for
union
membership?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you're
making
things
very
difficult
for
me
because
on
one
hand,
you're
asking
as
to
confine
ourselves
to
a
specific
situation.
i
don't
dispute
your
suggestion
that
that
specific
situation
as
prevalent,
dominant
numerically
but
you're
asking
us
to
confine
ourselves
to
a
specific
situation
and
nevertheless
to
blanket
in
every
kind
of
a
situation.
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
that
true
throughout
our
economic
life.
and
in
that
sense,
the
union
could
if
you
accept
that
theory.
why
couldn't
the
union
regulate
the
price
of
automobiles?
justice
abe
fortas
although
we
also
have
to
or
do
we
also
have
to
consider
in
these
two
cases
the
territorial
restrictions
and
all
of
the
other
things
are
in
this
complaint
is
originally
filed
as
--
which
was
as
i
understand,
dismissed
by
the
district
court.
don't
we
have
to
consider
territorial
restrictions
here
too?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what's
your
position
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
so
what
you're
saying
then
is
that
a
musicians
union,
they
prohibit
musicians
from
new
york
from
playing
in
washington
except
on
certain
conditions
vice
versa,
that
kind
of
thing?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
he
can't
play
here,
can
he,
unless
he
gets
permission
from
the
local
in
washington?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
sure
of
that?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
you
had
a
firm
to
render
electrical
service
--
service
electrical
fixtures
in
home
and
businesses
and
let's
suppose
that
the
talked
person
in
that
firm,
the
head
of
that
firm
was
a
working
electrician.
he
went
out
on
jobs
with
his
mandate
and
let's
suppose
that
all
of
the
members,
all
of
the
men
who
work
for
that
electrical
service
company
belonged
to
a
union,
now
could
the
union
fix
a
price
that
the
firm
would
charge
for
coming
out
to
or
going
out
to
your
house
and
installing
a
floor
plug.
let's
take
that
simple
illustration
of
that
sort.
what's
your
answer?
justice
abe
fortas
so
your
answer
to
my
question
is
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
contend
that
there's
any
case
that
this
court's
decided
that
supports
that
proposition?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
that
--
do
you
think
that
case
instead
was
a
proposition?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it's
your
issue
though.
justice
abe
fortas
i
say
that's
your
issue.
justice
abe
fortas
but
it's
not
really
a
price
is
it
mr.
schmidt?
is
there
anything
more
than
an
agreement
by
the
hotel
or
the
club
or
the
person
giving
the
party
to
pay
a
certain
minimum
wage
to
the
sideman
and
the
certain
and
specified
wage
to
the
leader,
that
wage
including
a
sideman's
pay
plus
something
on
top
of
it.
is
that
the
way
it
works?
justice
abe
fortas
i
want
you
to
state
it
as
precisely
as
you
can.
justice
abe
fortas
what
does
that
mean?
justice
abe
fortas
you've
got
to
employ
a
certain
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
what's
the
next
one?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what's
the
next
one?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
next?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
paid
through
the
leader.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
any
more?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
all
of
them?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
the
union
book
does
refer
to
those
as
price.
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
would
you
agree
mr.
schmidt
that
one
of
our
questions
is
whether
all
of
those
are
appropriately
part
of
the
wage
agreement
and
the
wage
contract,
or
whether
in
fact
they
should
be
regarding
it
as
a
fixing
of
the
price
for
a
totality
of
a
commodity
or
service
in
antitrust
terms?
justice
abe
fortas
that
--
that's
one
of
our
issues,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
mr.
schmidt,
it's
arguable.
although
i
didn't
hear
your
brother
make
the
argument,
i
suppose
it's
arguable
that
the
oliver
doctrine
has
--
is
not
relevant
here
because
here,
you
don't
have
anything
that
is
not
conventionally,
provisionally,
etcetera,
an
aspect
of
the
wage
contract.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
suggesting
the
possibility.
i
don't
know.
maybe
it's
not
relevant
because
you
don't
have
to
go
as
far
as
oliver
does
if
you
regard
all
of
these
items
that
you've
talked
about
here
as
conventional
and
provisional
part
of
the
wages.
instead
of
paying
the
man
$50.00
a
day,
you
pay
him
$20.00
and
then
you
add
on
all
of
these
other
items.
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
they
supervise?
justice
abe
fortas
well
your
action
is
solely
against
the
new
york
local,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
are
those
functions
always
performed
by
the
same
men
that
it
say
as
the
man
who
obtains
the

justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
it
might

somebody
else
too,
might
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
what
you're

is
that

that

so

is
that
what
you're

justice
abe
fortas
why
do

who

justice

i
must
