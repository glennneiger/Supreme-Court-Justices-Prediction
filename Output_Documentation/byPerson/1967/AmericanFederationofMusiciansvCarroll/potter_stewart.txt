it's

to

isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
aren't
there
at
least
some
orchestra
leaders
who
are
never
anything
but
leaders.
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
this
--
you
talked
about
club-dates
in
reading
the
briefs,
i
thought
the
dichotomy
was
between
single
engagements
being
engagements
up
to
five
days
and
steady
engagements
being
engagements
for
longer
than
that.
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
sub
--
subclassification
under
single
engagements,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
wrong?
justice
potter
stewart
not
lumping,
distinguishing
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i'd
thought
that
the
industry
practice
and
the
union
practice
was
to
categorize
the
distinguished
things
i
say
is
single
engagements
which
i
understood
it
were
up
to
five
days
up
to
a
week
or
five
days
in
steady
engagements
which
engagements
longer
than
that.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
there
are
subcategories
of
traveling
engagements
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
that
all
that
this
case
has
to
do
with,
club-date
and
hotel
steady
field?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
are
other
areas
where
the
leader
might
be
an
employer.
areas
other
than
the
club-date
and
hotel
--
steady
hotel
field
aren't
there?
there's
a
traveling
engagement
and
others.
justice
potter
stewart
and
single
engagements
of
up
to
five
days.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
go
back
to
this
small
group
which
you
concede
that
exist
that
consisting
of
people
who
are
leaders
and
only
leaders.
i
don't
want
to
date
myself
but
people
like
wayne
king
or
benny
goodman.
they
are
employers,
are
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
maybe
not
national
named
bands
but
in
a
particular
community,
a
person
could
--
there's
that
subcategory
i
suppose
isn't
there?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
implication
is
that
if
they
were,
the
result
would
have
been
different
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
why
is
it
say
so?
why
does
he
talk
about
it?
justice
potter
stewart
why
does
he
talk
about
the
fact
that
they're
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
because
of
a
kind
of
a
de
minimis?
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
suppose
a
non-performing
leader
and
that
is
a
leader
who
performs
only
by
waving
a
baton
around
is
not
in
job
competition
with
the
sidemen,
is
he?
justice

stewart
i
see.
justice

and
he's
somewhere
else
then?
justice
potter
stewart
although
he
called
the
engagement,
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
is
this
minimum
price
we're
talking
about?
is
this
a
package
price
for
the
whole
union
or
what
is
it?

stewart
plus
how
much?

the

is

that
didn't

any
