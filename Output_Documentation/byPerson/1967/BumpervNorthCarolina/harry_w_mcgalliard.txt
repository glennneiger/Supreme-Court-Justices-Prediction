mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
view
of
all
the
discussions
in
the
witherspoon
case
yesterday
unless
before
i
certainly
don't
want
to
be
repetitious
on
the
jury
question.
but
i'd
like
to
emphasize
one
or
two
points
that
might
help
clarify.
in
north
carolina
we
have
four
capital
crimes,
first
degree
murder,
arson,
first
degree
burglary,
rape.
the
punishment
as
the
statute
reads
is
death
unless
the
jury
shall
make
a
recommendation
of
life
imprisonment.
in
which
case,
it
shall
be
mandatory
that
the
judge
impose
by
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
well,
that's
the
newspaper
phrase
casually
used
down
there
often
but
our
statute
does
not
use
the
word
“mercy”
and
our
judges
have
continued
the
harping
on
the,
it's
a
recommendation
of
life
imprisonment
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
that's
correct.
in
which
case,
it
is
mandatory
that
a
judge
impose
life
imprisonment
and
nothing
else.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
in
other
words,
if
they
are
silent,
the
death
penalty
is
mandatory.
if
they
make
a
recommendation
of
life
imprisonment,
that
is
mandatory.
now,
i
think
the
principle
to
be
decided
in
this
jury
case
has
a
great
deal
more
significance
for
north
carolina
in
the
future
of
its
criminal
procedure
practices
than
perhaps
the
mere
question
of
a
single
new
trial
of
the
man
because
of
a
possible
error
of
this
--
the
search
and
seizure.
so
i'd
like
to
say
a
little
more
about
this.
as
mentioned
before,
north
carolina
does
not
by
statute
control
the
matter
of
challenge
of
a
juror
for
cause.
whether
you
call
it
common
law
or
whether
it's
been
judicial
practice
over
the
years,
certainly
by
court
holding,
the
first
general
principle
recognized
is
that
a
person
who
has
biased
may
on
the
challenge
be
excused
for
cause
which
of
course
in
no
ways
effects
his
right
to
take
his
full
number
for
preemptory
challenges
which
affixed
by
statute.
now,
in
our
court,
i
--
but
i'd
like
to
say
this,
not
only
does
the
statute
not
cover
it
but
actually
our
supreme
court
in
north
carolina
has
not
had
squarely
presented
to
it
the
question
of
how
far
must
you
prove
the
man
who
originally
says
he
has
opposed
the
capital
punishment.
in
order
to
reach
a
point
where
he
may
be
disqualified
by
challenged
for
bias.
but
the
assumption,
underlying
assumption
as
i
read
it
in
our
court
decisions,
is
that
they
assume
he
has
been
examined
to
the
point
that
he
could
not
in
this
particular
case
under
any
circumstances
imposed
the
death
penalty.
now
the
judge
writing
the
case
in
the
opinion
below
uses
this
sentence:
where
a
juror
states
in
advance
that
under
no
circumstances
would
he
accept
the
contentions
or
positions
of
a
party
which
in
this
case
would
be
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
he
is
not
impartial
to
that
party
but
as
a
corollary,
he
must
necessary
be
partial
to
the
adversary.
and
in
this
opinion
below
in
the
bumper
case,
the
judge
did
not
discuss
at
much
length
to
this
but
made
great
reference
to
a
case
a
few
months
or
few
years
earlier.
the
charles
case
in
which
chief
justice
parker
wrote
at
length
on
the
disqualification
of
the
juror
by
reason
of
bias
that
he
was
opposed
to
capital
punishment
and
judge
parker
there
again
assumed
also
apparently
that
we
are
talking
about
situation
where
the
man
has
said,
“i
cannot
in
this
case”
under
any
circumstances.
not
just
a
general
--
i'm
opposed
to
capital
punishment
attitude.
and
there
again,
the
judge
below
holding
judge,
the
chief
justice
parker,
who
in
terms
quoting
alr
"upon
the
theory,
the
conscientious
scrupulous
against
infliction
of
the
death
penalty
under
any
circumstances
or
equivalent
beliefs
equally
disqualify
a
jury
for
cause
of
prosecution
for
a
corrupted
crime
for
so
long.
so
i
think
we
can
fairly
say
that
although
the
question
hasn't
been
presented
in
exactly
that
fashion
our
court
has
adopted
the
position
that
it
does
not
make
this
test,
that
it
was
much
discussed
in
the
witherspoon
case.
now
as
--
going
a
little
further
to
the
practice,
defense
counsel,
i
suggested
that
every
juror
was
questioned
to
that
point
in
this
case.
i
think
in
all
fairness
to
him
of
the
16
excluded,
perhaps
two
of
them
were
questioned
quite
that
far.
two
of
them,
one
of
them
merely
said,
“i
do
not
believe
in
capital
punishment”.
it's
ms.
(inaudible)
record
page
19
and
ms.
fuller
record
page
16.
i
have
conscientious
or
religious
group
was
against
the
imposition
of
the
capital
punishment.
that
they
all
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
yes,
sir.
they
were
all
--
(inaudible)
i
don't
know.
i
assumed
they
were,
one
of
the
large
group.
they
were,
counsel
said.
now
i
take
it,
if
there's
error,
it
would
be
in
a
systematic
exclusion
of
a
group.
and
i
think,
in
the
light
of
what
our
supreme
court
has
said,
the
court
practice
in
this
case
of
14
of
the
16
were
excluded
only
when
they
did
make
this
proper
test
that
we
could
not
well
say
that
an
error
as
to
two
indicated
in
a
systematic
exclusion
on
the
part
of
the
state
or
the
court
system.
certainly,
the
trial
judges,
as
far
as
i
know,
the
prosecuting
attorneys
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
--
of
course,
i'd
be
willing
to
--
although
it's
necessary,
i
don't
think
north
carolina's
point
of
view,
i'd
be
willing
to
go
much
farther.
yesterday
--
i
mean
not
yesterday,
in
line
with
the
arguments
yesterday
and
take
the
view,
there's
enough
bias
perhaps
just
in
those
expressions.
but
i'm
saying
that
for
the
sake
of
argument
even
if
we
should
say
that
is
error
as
to
those
two.
i
don't
think
it's
a
type
of
error
that
shows
a
systematic
exclusion
of
a
nature
which
should
result
in
sending
the
case
back.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
mrs.
(inaudible)
says,
“i
do
not
believe
in
capital
punishment”.
ms.
fuller,
the
other
says,
“i
have
conscientious
or
religious
scruples
against
the
imposition
of
capital
punishment."
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
that
is
my
understanding
of
the
practice.
that
is
what
i
regard
as
the
proper
inference
from
what
they
have
--
say
it.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
that
is
true.
the
evidence
of
the
voir
dire
examinations
of
all
16
are
set
out
in
the
appendix.
i
examined
them
carefully
and
those
two,
it
seems
to
me,
perhaps
did
not
make
full
test
of
being
pushed
all
the
way.
what
i'm
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
that's
evidence
of
systematic
exclusion.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
that
it
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
well,
i
take
it
that
he
appeals
to
those
constitutional
protections
and
principles
as
a
basis
for
fighting
systematic
exclusion
and
not
proceeding
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
had
not
so
understood
but
i
maybe
thereon
--
maybe
i
should
not
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
--
simply
interpret
his
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
well,
my
answer
to
those
is
that
after
all,
there's
no
suggestion
that
the
jurors
he
in
fact
later
got
and
who
tried
him
were
qualified.
and
that
the
constitutional
error
or
the
fault
with
a
state
system
in
jury
exclusion
is
because
of
the
states
proceeding
to
--
in
a
wholesale
fashion
exclude
a
group
because
of
national
original
or
race
or
religion
or
economic
situation
and
that
having
those
such
systematic
exclusion
and
none
being
argued
for,
the
mere
fact
that
one
or
two
instances,
the
judge
may
have
wrongly
excused
a
particular
person
is
not
the
type
of
situation
that
would
invoke
the
protection
of
this
court
would
be
my
argument
on
that.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
checked
back
for
ten
years.
in
ten
years,
there
have
been
two.
one
of
those
was
in
1958.
that
was
for
rape.
i
handled
that
in
our
own
supreme
court,
certiorari
denied,
i
believe
in
this
court.
then,
there
was
one
for
rape
and
murder
in
1961.
they
are
the
last
two
in
the
even
ten
years.
i
did
--
they
have
statistics
back
with
that
but
did
not
bother
to
bring
them
with
me.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
we
now
have
four
on
death
row
if
you
were
interested
in
any
further
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
and
--
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
or
you
mean,
did
they
--
how
many
verdicts
were
returned
that
would've
resulted
in
the
death
penalty
had
not
something
in
the
way
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
--
of
new
trials
or
executive
clemency?
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i'm
not
sure
but
there
were
several.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
there
are
several.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
yes,
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
have
a
run
down
on
all
of
those
access,
what
happened
on
this
other
--
there
were
about
five
or
six,
maybe
eight
new
trials
resulting
in
life
sentences
at
the
second
trial.
one
instance,
one
man
was
committed
to
life.
there
might
have
been
ten
cases
where
new
trials
--
one,
the
elmer
davis
case
which
was
up
here
resulted
in
nothing
because
the
principal
evidence
was
a
confession
which
was
held
improper.
now
to
come
back
to
your
question,
i
suppose
what's
your
aiming
at
now
is
what
the
petitioner's
counsel
has
described
as
a
conviction
prone
attitude
of
people
who
are
not
opposed
to
capital
punishment
as
against
the
opposite.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
take
it
that
--
i
don't
know
and
i
don't
think
he
knows.
and
i
don't
think
the
studies
have
been
made
are
adequate
to
draw
conclusions
as
to
whether
people
who
are
the
ones
i'm
familiar
with,
the
ones
petitioner
to
counsel
has
cited
in
his
brief
and
referred
to
do
not
go
far
toward
convincing
me.
i
think
they
are
taken
from
small,
selected,
unrepresentives
group
--
unrepresented
groups.
the
numbers
involved
are
numerically
small.
there
are
conclusions,
to
me,
would
be
about
it,
a
petty
thing
upon
which
to
base
such
a
broad
conclusion
as
to
the
psychological
attitudes
and
predilections
of
what,
80
million
people
(inaudible)
make
the
120
might
be
subject
to
jury
service.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
one
of
them
was
or
may
be
more
were
filed
to
--
were
filed
and
came
along
to
our
supreme
court
as
exhibits.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i'm
not
sure.
where
they
filed
was
the
georgian
trial
court.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
only
at
the
appellate
level.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
no
sir.
these
were
references
in
--
of
the
--
in
part
of
these
manuscripts
but
in
part
to
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
believe
that's
correct.
and
as
far
as
i'm
personally
concerned,
i
reject
the
whole
idea.
i
don't
think,
i
--
of
course,
i'm
a
poor
judge
myself
and
i
don't
think
i'm
anymore
conviction
prone
because
i
do
not
have
a
last
ditch
opposition
to
capital
punishment.
but
i
don't
think
we
have
yet
reached
that
point:
i
--
where
you
concede,
(inaudible)
and
others
show
that,
perhaps
the
majority
of
the
american
people
at
present
take
your
position
“opposed
to
capital
punishment”,
whatever
that
means.
well,
i'll
oppose
to
it
if
there's
a
way
to
effectively
organize
our
prison
systems,
our
parole
systems
and
what
not
to
--
maybe
keep
out
of
circulation
indefinitely
some
known
dangerous
types
at
the
systems
at
present
don't
effectively
occur.
but
on
that,
all
i
could
say
is
certainly
not
proven
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
that
those
of
us
who
do
not
oppose
capital
punishment
or
authoritarian
or
they've
got
pages
of
attitudes
of
what
we
are
and
i
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
let
me
say
this.
i
gathered
from
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
a
while
ago
and
yours.
if
this
takes
me
out
of
the
record
of
course,
i
can
tell
you
what
i've
found
out
about
the
search
warrant
if
you
want
me
to.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
understood
defense
counsel
to
say
he
believed
that
to
be
true
on
the
basis
of
a
dictum.
i
have
no
current
recollection
of
the
dictum.
the
situation,
so
far
as
i
know,
has
not
arisen
but
i
rather
think
and
i
have
nothing
here
to
cite,
i
rather
think
that
the
situation
is
this:
the
jury
is
instructed
first
to
consider
guilt
or
innocence.
if
they
return
a
verdict
of
guilty,
then
they're
instructed
to
consider
whether
they
will
recommend
life
imprisonment
or
not.
i
think
once
they
voted
guilty,
they
have
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
would
come
out
with
that
and
could
only
come
out
with
a
recommendation
of
mercy
or
life
imprisonment
rather
if
they
all
agree.
i'd
rather
think
that
might
be
but
i
don't
think
either
if
it
would
say
that
north
carolina
has
decided
that.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
have
been
handling
great
many
of
this
--
it's
over
200
criminals
appeals
in
the
last
ten
years.
they're
in
our
supreme
court
and
i
have
--
we've
only
had
the
recommendation
for
mercy
about
25
years.
i've
been
in
the
attorney
general's
office
longer
than
that.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
twenty-five
to
30
and
this
has
never
crossed
my
path.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
no,
i
find
everyday
--
i
think
--
more
things
i
don't
know.
now,
coming
very
quickly
and
i
gathered
from
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
justice
marshall's
question,
i
frankly
was
a
little
annoyed
upset
when
i
picked
up
the
record
and
saw
just
two
things.
first,
the
officers
went
into
the
lady's
house
and
said,
”we
want
to
search.
we
have
a
warrant”,
that's
as
far
as
the
officers
went
and
then
i
saw:
solicitor
says,
"whether
you
rely
on
consent,
judge
by
consent.
i
didn't
even
look
at
that
again
till
the
next
day
because
i
know
this
general
principle
is
rather
hard
to
overcome
the
presumption
that
the
consent
was
merely
acquiescence
to
the
authority
of
the
law
under
such
circumstances.
however
that
may
be,
that
is
what
they
did
and
the
question
is,
under
those
circumstances,
is
it
still
possible
to
consent?
you
cannot
volunteer
a
consent
to
be
shown.
the
only
way
i
know
would
be
to
try
to
determine
the
frame
of
mind
of
this
person,
the
attitude
with
which
she
did
or
did
not
consent.
she
said,
i
would
pay
him
much
attention.
i
told
mr.
stockard,
that's
the
sheriff,
that's
on
page
47
of
the
appendix,
to
go
ahead
and
look
them
--
look
all
over
the
house.
i
had
no
objection
them
making
a
search
on
my
house.
i
was
willing
to
let
them
look
in
any
room
or
drawer
in
my
house
they
wanted
to.
and
further
on:
“and
i
just
give
them
a
free
will
to
look
because
i
felt
like
the
boy
wasn't
guilty."
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
want
them
be
to
be
satisfied.
the
record,
the
only
testimony
on
that
is
that
the
lady,
whose
house
was
searched,
say
it,
“they
told
me
they
had
a
notice
or
a
warrant
to
search
my
house.”
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
that
is
not
disputed
in
the
record.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
that
it
would.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
that
it
would.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
it
was
not
produced
at
the
trial.
as
i
understand
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
if
i
had
nothing
else
to
go
on
and
i
think
you're
bound
by
the
record,
i
would
take
it
they
either
had
a
defective
search
warrant
or
no
search
warrant
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
--
be
my
conclusion.
now
i
was
curious
enough,
as
mr.
justice
harlan
has
asked,
was
there
a
piece
of
paper?
now
i
did
not
know
whether
you
meant
me
to
answer
that
by
going
out
of
the
record
or
not.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
well,
i
was
curious
enough
finally
after
certiorari
was
granted.
i
called
the
solicitor
asked
him,
“what
was
going
on?”
i
said,
“why
--
what's
wrong
with
your
search
warrant
i
seem
to
have
what
i
didn't
think
they
are
also
rely
on
but
i'm
seeing
--
do
something
wrong
with
the
warrant.
he
said,
“well,
that's
months
ago.
i
don't
remember
now
why
i
don't
use
it”
said
the
lady
consented.
if
you
could've
seen
the
way
she
talked,
how
open,
cooperative
she
was
in
the
courtroom
with
--
not
thinking
about
they
had
any
question
about
his
being
a
genuine
consent.
i
said,
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
warrant.
he
said,
“well,
i
have
to
look
it
up”.
he
said,
“i'll
send
your
copy”.
so
the
next
morning
in
the
mail,
i
get
an
--
xerox,
i
guess
it
is
copy
of
the
search
warrant.
with
this
note
from
the
solicitor
enclosed
by
(inaudible)
search
warrant
in
the
case
state
against
bumper
about
which
you
called
today.
i
remember
now
why
i
elect
you
to
go
on
a
consent
to
search
basis.
after
mrs.leath,
told
the
officers
they
didn't
need
a
search
warrant,
they
didn't
serve
it.
please
pardon
the
informality
and
without
(inaudible).
there
--
at
the
place
where
the
officers
returned
with
ordinarily
be
filled
in
that
we
own
this
day
search,
a
such
a
place
and
found
such
argument.
there
is
nothing.
i
would
argue,
i
don't
know
how
far
it
would
get
on
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
remembered
now
why
i
elected
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
--
to
go
on
a
consent
to
search
basis.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
after
miss
leath,
that's
the
lady
in
question,
told
the
officers
they
didn't
need
the
search
warrant,
they
didn't
serve
it.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
serve
it.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
serve
it.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
of
course
the
solicitor's
notion
and
my
notion
of
service
are
two
different
things.
i
take
it
once
you
have
a
search
warrant,
announced
you
have
it
and
proceeds
search
with
it,
and
that's
an
adequate
service
unless
the
person
they're
in
charged
demands
that
it
would
be
read.
i
would
argue
under
ms.leath's
testimony
that
they
served
--
that
they
served
this
at
a
--
in
a
subsequent
trial,
they
wanted
to
show
the
validity
of
the
search.
and
it's
ruled
out
that
there
was
no
--
i
mean,
ruled
that
there
was
no
consent
here.i'd
like
to
go
a
little
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
it's
absolutely
blank.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
does
not
say,
received
this
day,
i
mean
the
form
was
error,
received
this
day,
i
entered
so
and
so
where
i
found,
so
that's
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
no,
sir.
this
is
simply
--
the
prosecuting
attorney,
we
call
it
solicitors,
sent
me
a
copy
of
the
search
warrant
because
of
my
annoyance
with
him
and
talking
to
him
over
the
phone.
so
it's
off
the
record,
as
i
say
and
i
was
very
careful
to
inquire
whether
you
wanted
me
to
discuss
it.
but
that's
what
i
found
out
in
my
own
satisfaction.
i'd
like
to
move
one
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
don't
find
the
solicitor's
words
in
the
record.
the
strongest
words
i
found
on
the
record
are
the
ones
i
just
read
before
such
as
“i
gave
them
a
free
will
to
look
because
i
felt
like
the
boy
wasn't
guilty.
i
wanted
them
to
be
satisfied.
i
had
no
objection
to
the
making
of
search
of
my
house”.
now
all
of
that's
on
page
47
of
the
appendix.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
no,
that
was
the
officer's
conclusion
from
apparently
the
he
is
stating
that
they
didn't
need
it
because
when
they
walked
in
they
apparently
--
they
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
that's
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
that's
what
i
said.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
think
this
language
is
susceptible
to
that
interpretation
that
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
well,
i
thought
it's
rather
significant
that
apparently
neither
the
prosecution
or
defense
counsel
cared
to
put
apparently
that
question
directly
to
her
which
would've
settled
it.
whether
the
search
warrant
made
any
difference
or
whether
she
was
consenting
with
or
without
it,
neither
side
cared
to
ask
her
the
very
appointed
question
that
could've
helped
resolve
the
issue.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
that's
as
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
for
about
the
first
thing
the
officers
said
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
that's
true
but
she
had
yet
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
she
--
although
we
are
here
to
qualify
it
but
said,
“i
gave
them
a
free
will
to
look
because
i
felt
like
the
boy
wasn't
guilty.
i
want
them
to
be
satisfied.
i
have
no
objection
of
making
the
search”.
and
she
says
all
of
that.
i
don't
know
that
that
is
mere
acquiescence
to
the
authority
of
the
law.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
think
the
officers
had
the
search
--
here's
what
i
think.
i
think
they
had
one.
i
think
they
went
in.
i
think
here
was
this
elderly
lady
and
they
had
a
search
warrant
in
his
pocket,
say,
"we
got
a
search
warrant,
we're
going
to
search
your
house."
said,
“go
ahead,
help
yourselves,
go
right
in."
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
then
i
think
that
they
said,
“well,
we
have
a
paper
writing
here.
you
have
to
let
us”.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
don't
know.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
don't
know.
i
gather
that
the
literacy
was
not
great
if
any.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
they
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
think
there's
a
statutory
requirement
that
it
should
be
returned.
they
hold
the
goods
return
to
keep
them
subject
to
the
order
of
the
court
file
the
return.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
but
i
don't
know
if
that
filing
--
the
filling
of
this
(inaudible),
if
in
fact
they
did
the
things
as
ordered,
would
be
requisite
to
its
validity
in
court,
the
mere
fact
that
it
did
not
been
properly
returned.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
suspect
they
took
it
back
in
through
a
van
so
they
didn't
need
warrant
at
all.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
we
had
a
sheriff
and
a
--
two
deputies
of
the
county.
they
were
accompanied
by,
i
must
say
in
all
honesty
by
agent
of
the
state
bureau
of
investigation
which
is
a
state
investigating
agents.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
of
the
record
does
not
disclose
any
existence
of
a
search
warrant
beyond
the
statement
to
the
officer
as
relayed
by
ms.leath
to
the
state
and
of
the
officer.
anything
else
i
know
is
off
the
record.
as
far
as
i
know,
it's
not
brought
up.
no
search
warrant
was
introduced
at
the
trial.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
apparently,
and
this
surprised
me,
the
only
person
that
was
put
on
the
witness
stand
was
the
lady
in
question
and
when
she
finished
talking,
the
judge
said,
“i
find
there
was
voluntary
consent”.
they
thought
she
had
said
enough.
they've
took
her
manner,
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
--
her
demeanor,
and
her
words
is
to
mean
she
consented
it.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
she
said,
part
of
what
i've
just
been
--
when
the
officers
asked
me
to
let
them
search,
well,
i
would
tell
you
what
i've
though
about,
what
went
through
my
mind.
they
didn't
tell
me
what
they're
searching
for,
what
it
was
all
about.
they
didn't
talk
to
me
at
all.
they
just
went
to
head.
i
had
in
mind
what
they
was
looking
for
and
searching
for.
and
i
felt
like
well,
whatever
they
was
looking
for,
they
had
found
it.
and
i
didn't
think
it
amount
to
anything
with
the
boy.
i
just
give
them
a
free
will
to
look
because
i
felt
like
the
boy
wasn't
guilty”.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
this?
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
in
my
opinion,
it
is
a
valid
search
warrant
but
that's
off
the
record
again.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
well
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
not
one
out
of
it.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
that
they
went
there
without
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
no,
sir.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
would
interpret
that
a
different
way.
i
would
say
they
told
the
lady
they
have
a
search
warrant.
they
went
back
in
the
court
and
said
we
won't
rely
on
the
search
warrant.
we
think
there
was
consent.
the
judge
who
listened
to
her
and
watched
her
on
the
witness
stand
interpreted
it
as
being
consent.
and
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
thought
that
judge
(inaudible)
findings
were
justified
by
the
record.
i
see
nothing
to
--
from
the
record
they
would
make
you
conclude
the
officers
were
lying.
there's
no
evidence
of
that.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
not
any
that
i
could
instruct
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
no
sir.
not
in
the
light
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
i
would
always
use
one.
if
we're
ever
to
get
by
the
consent
question,
i
have
raised
in
my
brief,
my
time
is
about
up,
considerable
question
as
to
whether
this
defendant
has
any
standing
to
challenge
this
on
the
ground
that
it
was
his
grandmother's
premises,
his
grandmother's
rifle,
he
was
not
present,
as
far
as
i
could
gather,
at
the
time
of
the
search
and
the
only
theory
i
can
think
of
would
be
whether
we
have
invaded
an
area
of
his
privacy
in
that
he
was
also
domicile
in
the
same
home.
but
we
must
remember
it
was
grandmother's
rifle
and
even
as
suggested
here,
there's
no
evidence,
members
of
the
family
had
a
free
right
to
use
grandmother's
rifle
and
she
said
it
was
her
rifle.
i
don't
believe
there's
any
implied
permission
to
take
the
rifle
and
go
after
to
commit
two
capital
offenses
of
rape
and
two
attempted
murders.
and
we
don't
think
his
area
of
privacy
was
invaded.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
alright.
shall
i
leave
this
solicitor's
note
with
it?
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
thank
you.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
view
of
all
the
discussions
in
the
witherspoon
case
yesterday
unless
before
i
certainly
don't
want
to
be
repetitious
on
the
jury
question.
but
i'd
like
to
emphasize
one
or
two
points
that
might
help
clarify.
in
north
carolina
we
have
four
capital
crimes,
first
degree
murder,
arson,
first
degree
burglary,
rape.
the
punishment
as
the
statute
reads
is
death
unless
the
jury
shall
make
a
recommendation
of
life
imprisonment.
in
which
case,
it
shall
be
mandatory
that
the
judge
impose
by
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
well,
that's
the
newspaper
phrase
casually
used
down
there
often
but
our
statute
does
not
use
the
word
“mercy”
and
our
judges
have
continued
the
harping
on
the,
it's
a
recommendation
of
life
imprisonment
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
that's
correct.
in
which
case,
it
is
mandatory
that
a
judge
impose
life
imprisonment
and
nothing
else.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
in
other
words,
if
they
are
silent,
the
death
penalty
is
mandatory.
if
they
make
a
recommendation
of
life
imprisonment,
that
is
mandatory.
now,
i
think
the
principle
to
be
decided
in
this
jury
case
has
a
great
deal
more
significance
for
north
carolina
in
the
future
of
its
criminal
procedure
practices
than
perhaps
the
mere
question
of
a
single
new
trial
of
the
man
because
of
a
possible
error
of
this
--
the
search
and
seizure.
so
i'd
like
to
say
a
little
more
about
this.
as
mentioned
before,
north
carolina
does
not
by
statute
control
the
matter
of
challenge
of
a
juror
for
cause.
whether
you
call
it
common
law
or
whether
it's
been
judicial
practice
over
the
years,
certainly
by
court
holding,
the
first
general
principle
recognized
is
that
a
person
who
has
biased
may
on
the
challenge
be
excused
for
cause
which
of
course
in
no
ways
effects
his
right
to
take
his
full
number
for
preemptory
challenges
which
affixed
by
statute.
now,
in
our
court,
i
--
but
i'd
like
to
say
this,
not
only
does
the
statute
not
cover
it
but
actually
our
supreme
court
in
north
carolina
has
not
had
squarely
presented
to
it
the
question
of
how
far
must
you
prove
the
man
who
originally
says
he
has
opposed
the
capital
punishment.
in
order
to
reach
a
point
where
he
may
be
disqualified
by
challenged
for
bias.
but
the
assumption,
underlying
assumption
as
i
read
it
in
our
court
decisions,
is
that
they
assume
he
has
been
examined
to
the
point
that
he
could
not
in
this
particular
case
under
any
circumstances
imposed
the
death
penalty.
now
the
judge
writing
the
case
in
the
opinion
below
uses
this
sentence:
where
a
juror
states
in
advance
that
under
no
circumstances
would
he
accept
the
contentions
or
positions
of
a
party
which
in
this
case
would
be
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
he
is
not
impartial
to
that
party
but
as
a
corollary,
he
must
necessary
be
partial
to
the
adversary.
and
in
this
opinion
below
in
the
bumper
case,
the
judge
did
not
discuss
at
much
length
to
this
but
made
great
reference
to
a
case
a
few
months
or
few
years
earlier.
the
charles
case
in
which
chief
justice
parker
wrote
at
length
on
the
disqualification
of
the
juror
by
reason
of
bias
that
he
was
opposed
to
capital
punishment
and
judge
parker
there
again
assumed
also
apparently
that
we
are
talking
about
situation
where
the
man
has
said,
“i
cannot
in
this
case”
under
any
circumstances.
not
just
a
general
--
i'm
opposed
to
capital
punishment
attitude.
and
there
again,
the
judge
below
holding
judge,
the
chief
justice
parker,
who
in
terms
quoting
alr
"upon
the
theory,
the
conscientious
scrupulous
against
infliction
of
the
death
penalty
under
any
circumstances
or
equivalent
beliefs
equally
disqualify
a
jury
for
cause
of
prosecution
for
a
corrupted
crime
for
so
long.
so
i
think
we
can
fairly
say
that
although
the
question
hasn't
been
presented
in
exactly
that
fashion
our
court
has
adopted
the
position
that
it
does
not
make
this
test,
that
it
was
much
discussed
in
the
witherspoon
case.
now
as
--
going
a
little
further
to
the
practice,
defense
counsel,
i
suggested
that
every
juror
was
questioned
to
that
point
in
this
case.
i
think
in
all
fairness
to
him
of
the
16
excluded,
perhaps
two
of
them
were
questioned
quite
that
far.
two
of
them,
one
of
them
merely
said,
“i
do
not
believe
in
capital
punishment”.
it's
ms.
(inaudible)
record
page
19
and
ms.
fuller
record
page
16.
i
have
conscientious
or
religious
group
was
against
the
imposition
of
the
capital
punishment.
that
they
all
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
yes,
sir.
they
were
all
--
(inaudible)
i
don't
know.
i
assumed
they
were,
one
of
the
large
group.
they
were,
counsel
said.
now
i
take
it,
if
there's
error,
it
would
be
in
a
systematic
exclusion
of
a
group.
and
i
think,
in
the
light
of
what
our
supreme
court
has
said,
the
court
practice
in
this
case
of
14
of
the
16
were
excluded
only
when
they
did
make
this
proper
test
that
we
could
not
well
say
that
an
error
as
to
two
indicated
in
a
systematic
exclusion
on
the
part
of
the
state
or
the
court
system.
certainly,
the
trial
judges,
as
far
as
i
know,
the
prosecuting
attorneys
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
--
of
course,
i'd
be
willing
to
--
although
it's
necessary,
i
don't
think
north
carolina's
point
of
view,
i'd
be
willing
to
go
much
farther.
yesterday
--
i
mean
not
yesterday,
in
line
with
the
arguments
yesterday
and
take
the
view,
there's
enough
bias
perhaps
just
in
those
expressions.
but
i'm
saying
that
for
the
sake
of
argument
even
if
we
should
say
that
is
error
as
to
those
two.
i
don't
think
it's
a
type
of
error
that
shows
a
systematic
exclusion
of
a
nature
which
should
result
in
sending
the
case
back.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
mrs.
(inaudible)
says,
“i
do
not
believe
in
capital
punishment”.
ms.
fuller,
the
other
says,
“i
have
conscientious
or
religious
scruples
against
the
imposition
of
capital
punishment."
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
that
is
my
understanding
of
the
practice.
that
is
what
i
regard
as
the
proper
inference
from
what
they
have
--
say
it.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
that
is
true.
the
evidence
of
the
voir
dire
examinations
of
all
16
are
set
out
in
the
appendix.
i
examined
them
carefully
and
those
two,
it
seems
to
me,
perhaps
did
not
make
full
test
of
being
pushed
all
the
way.
what
i'm
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
that's
evidence
of
systematic
exclusion.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
that
it
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
well,
i
take
it
that
he
appeals
to
those
constitutional
protections
and
principles
as
a
basis
for
fighting
systematic
exclusion
and
not
proceeding
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
had
not
so
understood
but
i
maybe
thereon
--
maybe
i
should
not
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
--
simply
interpret
his
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
well,
my
answer
to
those
is
that
after
all,
there's
no
suggestion
that
the
jurors
he
in
fact
later
got
and
who
tried
him
were
qualified.
and
that
the
constitutional
error
or
the
fault
with
a
state
system
in
jury
exclusion
is
because
of
the
states
proceeding
to
--
in
a
wholesale
fashion
exclude
a
group
because
of
national
original
or
race
or
religion
or
economic
situation
and
that
having
those
such
systematic
exclusion
and
none
being
argued
for,
the
mere
fact
that
one
or
two
instances,
the
judge
may
have
wrongly
excused
a
particular
person
is
not
the
type
of
situation
that
would
invoke
the
protection
of
this
court
would
be
my
argument
on
that.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
checked
back
for
ten
years.
in
ten
years,
there
have
been
two.
one
of
those
was
in
1958.
that
was
for
rape.
i
handled
that
in
our
own
supreme
court,
certiorari
denied,
i
believe
in
this
court.
then,
there
was
one
for
rape
and
murder
in
1961.
they
are
the
last
two
in
the
even
ten
years.
i
did
--
they
have
statistics
back
with
that
but
did
not
bother
to
bring
them
with
me.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
we
now
have
four
on
death
row
if
you
were
interested
in
any
further
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
and
--
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
or
you
mean,
did
they
--
how
many
verdicts
were
returned
that
would've
resulted
in
the
death
penalty
had
not
something
in
the
way
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
--
of
new
trials
or
executive
clemency?
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i'm
not
sure
but
there
were
several.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
there
are
several.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
yes,
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
have
a
run
down
on
all
of
those
access,
what
happened
on
this
other
--
there
were
about
five
or
six,
maybe
eight
new
trials
resulting
in
life
sentences
at
the
second
trial.
one
instance,
one
man
was
committed
to
life.
there
might
have
been
ten
cases
where
new
trials
--
one,
the
elmer
davis
case
which
was
up
here
resulted
in
nothing
because
the
principal
evidence
was
a
confession
which
was
held
improper.
now
to
come
back
to
your
question,
i
suppose
what's
your
aiming
at
now
is
what
the
petitioner's
counsel
has
described
as
a
conviction
prone
attitude
of
people
who
are
not
opposed
to
capital
punishment
as
against
the
opposite.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
take
it
that
--
i
don't
know
and
i
don't
think
he
knows.
and
i
don't
think
the
studies
have
been
made
are
adequate
to
draw
conclusions
as
to
whether
people
who
are
the
ones
i'm
familiar
with,
the
ones
petitioner
to
counsel
has
cited
in
his
brief
and
referred
to
do
not
go
far
toward
convincing
me.
i
think
they
are
taken
from
small,
selected,
unrepresentives
group
--
unrepresented
groups.
the
numbers
involved
are
numerically
small.
there
are
conclusions,
to
me,
would
be
about
it,
a
petty
thing
upon
which
to
base
such
a
broad
conclusion
as
to
the
psychological
attitudes
and
predilections
of
what,
80
million
people
(inaudible)
make
the
120
might
be
subject
to
jury
service.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
one
of
them
was
or
may
be
more
were
filed
to
--
were
filed
and
came
along
to
our
supreme
court
as
exhibits.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i'm
not
sure.
where
they
filed
was
the
georgian
trial
court.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
only
at
the
appellate
level.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
no
sir.
these
were
references
in
--
of
the
--
in
part
of
these
manuscripts
but
in
part
to
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
believe
that's
correct.
and
as
far
as
i'm
personally
concerned,
i
reject
the
whole
idea.
i
don't
think,
i
--
of
course,
i'm
a
poor
judge
myself
and
i
don't
think
i'm
anymore
conviction
prone
because
i
do
not
have
a
last
ditch
opposition
to
capital
punishment.
but
i
don't
think
we
have
yet
reached
that
point:
i
--
where
you
concede,
(inaudible)
and
others
show
that,
perhaps
the
majority
of
the
american
people
at
present
take
your
position
“opposed
to
capital
punishment”,
whatever
that
means.
well,
i'll
oppose
to
it
if
there's
a
way
to
effectively
organize
our
prison
systems,
our
parole
systems
and
what
not
to
--
maybe
keep
out
of
circulation
indefinitely
some
known
dangerous
types
at
the
systems
at
present
don't
effectively
occur.
but
on
that,
all
i
could
say
is
certainly
not
proven
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
that
those
of
us
who
do
not
oppose
capital
punishment
or
authoritarian
or
they've
got
pages
of
attitudes
of
what
we
are
and
i
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
let
me
say
this.
i
gathered
from
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
a
while
ago
and
yours.
if
this
takes
me
out
of
the
record
of
course,
i
can
tell
you
what
i've
found
out
about
the
search
warrant
if
you
want
me
to.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
understood
defense
counsel
to
say
he
believed
that
to
be
true
on
the
basis
of
a
dictum.
i
have
no
current
recollection
of
the
dictum.
the
situation,
so
far
as
i
know,
has
not
arisen
but
i
rather
think
and
i
have
nothing
here
to
cite,
i
rather
think
that
the
situation
is
this:
the
jury
is
instructed
first
to
consider
guilt
or
innocence.
if
they
return
a
verdict
of
guilty,
then
they're
instructed
to
consider
whether
they
will
recommend
life
imprisonment
or
not.
i
think
once
they
voted
guilty,
they
have
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
would
come
out
with
that
and
could
only
come
out
with
a
recommendation
of
mercy
or
life
imprisonment
rather
if
they
all
agree.
i'd
rather
think
that
might
be
but
i
don't
think
either
if
it
would
say
that
north
carolina
has
decided
that.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
have
been
handling
great
many
of
this
--
it's
over
200
criminals
appeals
in
the
last
ten
years.
they're
in
our
supreme
court
and
i
have
--
we've
only
had
the
recommendation
for
mercy
about
25
years.
i've
been
in
the
attorney
general's
office
longer
than
that.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
twenty-five
to
30
and
this
has
never
crossed
my
path.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
no,
i
find
everyday
--
i
think
--
more
things
i
don't
know.
now,
coming
very
quickly
and
i
gathered
from
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
justice
marshall's
question,
i
frankly
was
a
little
annoyed
upset
when
i
picked
up
the
record
and
saw
just
two
things.
first,
the
officers
went
into
the
lady's
house
and
said,
”we
want
to
search.
we
have
a
warrant”,
that's
as
far
as
the
officers
went
and
then
i
saw:
solicitor
says,
"whether
you
rely
on
consent,
judge
by
consent.
i
didn't
even
look
at
that
again
till
the
next
day
because
i
know
this
general
principle
is
rather
hard
to
overcome
the
presumption
that
the
consent
was
merely
acquiescence
to
the
authority
of
the
law
under
such
circumstances.
however
that
may
be,
that
is
what
they
did
and
the
question
is,
under
those
circumstances,
is
it
still
possible
to
consent?
you
cannot
volunteer
a
consent
to
be
shown.
the
only
way
i
know
would
be
to
try
to
determine
the
frame
of
mind
of
this
person,
the
attitude
with
which
she
did
or
did
not
consent.
she
said,
i
would
pay
him
much
attention.
i
told
mr.
stockard,
that's
the
sheriff,
that's
on
page
47
of
the
appendix,
to
go
ahead
and
look
them
--
look
all
over
the
house.
i
had
no
objection
them
making
a
search
on
my
house.
i
was
willing
to
let
them
look
in
any
room
or
drawer
in
my
house
they
wanted
to.
and
further
on:
“and
i
just
give
them
a
free
will
to
look
because
i
felt
like
the
boy
wasn't
guilty."
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
want
them
be
to
be
satisfied.
the
record,
the
only
testimony
on
that
is
that
the
lady,
whose
house
was
searched,
say
it,
“they
told
me
they
had
a
notice
or
a
warrant
to
search
my
house.”
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
that
is
not
disputed
in
the
record.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
that
it
would.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
that
it
would.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
it
was
not
produced
at
the
trial.
as
i
understand
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
if
i
had
nothing
else
to
go
on
and
i
think
you're
bound
by
the
record,
i
would
take
it
they
either
had
a
defective
search
warrant
or
no
search
warrant
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
--
be
my
conclusion.
now
i
was
curious
enough,
as
mr.
justice
harlan
has
asked,
was
there
a
piece
of
paper?
now
i
did
not
know
whether
you
meant
me
to
answer
that
by
going
out
of
the
record
or
not.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
well,
i
was
curious
enough
finally
after
certiorari
was
granted.
i
called
the
solicitor
asked
him,
“what
was
going
on?”
i
said,
“why
--
what's
wrong
with
your
search
warrant
i
seem
to
have
what
i
didn't
think
they
are
also
rely
on
but
i'm
seeing
--
do
something
wrong
with
the
warrant.
he
said,
“well,
that's
months
ago.
i
don't
remember
now
why
i
don't
use
it”
said
the
lady
consented.
if
you
could've
seen
the
way
she
talked,
how
open,
cooperative
she
was
in
the
courtroom
with
--
not
thinking
about
they
had
any
question
about
his
being
a
genuine
consent.
i
said,
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
warrant.
he
said,
“well,
i
have
to
look
it
up”.
he
said,
“i'll
send
your
copy”.
so
the
next
morning
in
the
mail,
i
get
an
--
xerox,
i
guess
it
is
copy
of
the
search
warrant.
with
this
note
from
the
solicitor
enclosed
by
(inaudible)
search
warrant
in
the
case
state
against
bumper
about
which
you
called
today.
i
remember
now
why
i
elect
you
to
go
on
a
consent
to
search
basis.
after
mrs.leath,
told
the
officers
they
didn't
need
a
search
warrant,
they
didn't
serve
it.
please
pardon
the
informality
and
without
(inaudible).
there
--
at
the
place
where
the
officers
returned
with
ordinarily
be
filled
in
that
we
own
this
day
search,
a
such
a
place
and
found
such
argument.
there
is
nothing.
i
would
argue,
i
don't
know
how
far
it
would
get
on
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
remembered
now
why
i
elected
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
--
to
go
on
a
consent
to
search
basis.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
after
miss
leath,
that's
the
lady
in
question,
told
the
officers
they
didn't
need
the
search
warrant,
they
didn't
serve
it.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
serve
it.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
serve
it.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
of
course
the
solicitor's
notion
and
my
notion
of
service
are
two
different
things.
i
take
it
once
you
have
a
search
warrant,
announced
you
have
it
and
proceeds
search
with
it,
and
that's
an
adequate
service
unless
the
person
they're
in
charged
demands
that
it
would
be
read.
i
would
argue
under
ms.leath's
testimony
that
they
served
--
that
they
served
this
at
a
--
in
a
subsequent
trial,
they
wanted
to
show
the
validity
of
the
search.
and
it's
ruled
out
that
there
was
no
--
i
mean,
ruled
that
there
was
no
consent
here.i'd
like
to
go
a
little
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
it's
absolutely
blank.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
does
not
say,
received
this
day,
i
mean
the
form
was
error,
received
this
day,
i
entered
so
and
so
where
i
found,
so
that's
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
no,
sir.
this
is
simply
--
the
prosecuting
attorney,
we
call
it
solicitors,
sent
me
a
copy
of
the
search
warrant
because
of
my
annoyance
with
him
and
talking
to
him
over
the
phone.
so
it's
off
the
record,
as
i
say
and
i
was
very
careful
to
inquire
whether
you
wanted
me
to
discuss
it.
but
that's
what
i
found
out
in
my
own
satisfaction.
i'd
like
to
move
one
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
don't
find
the
solicitor's
words
in
the
record.
the
strongest
words
i
found
on
the
record
are
the
ones
i
just
read
before
such
as
“i
gave
them
a
free
will
to
look
because
i
felt
like
the
boy
wasn't
guilty.
i
wanted
them
to
be
satisfied.
i
had
no
objection
to
the
making
of
search
of
my
house”.
now
all
of
that's
on
page
47
of
the
appendix.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
no,
that
was
the
officer's
conclusion
from
apparently
the
he
is
stating
that
they
didn't
need
it
because
when
they
walked
in
they
apparently
--
they
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
that's
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
that's
what
i
said.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
think
this
language
is
susceptible
to
that
interpretation
that
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
well,
i
thought
it's
rather
significant
that
apparently
neither
the
prosecution
or
defense
counsel
cared
to
put
apparently
that
question
directly
to
her
which
would've
settled
it.
whether
the
search
warrant
made
any
difference
or
whether
she
was
consenting
with
or
without
it,
neither
side
cared
to
ask
her
the
very
appointed
question
that
could've
helped
resolve
the
issue.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
that's
as
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
for
about
the
first
thing
the
officers
said
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
that's
true
but
she
had
yet
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
she
--
although
we
are
here
to
qualify
it
but
said,
“i
gave
them
a
free
will
to
look
because
i
felt
like
the
boy
wasn't
guilty.
i
want
them
to
be
satisfied.
i
have
no
objection
of
making
the
search”.
and
she
says
all
of
that.
i
don't
know
that
that
is
mere
acquiescence
to
the
authority
of
the
law.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
think
the
officers
had
the
search
--
here's
what
i
think.
i
think
they
had
one.
i
think
they
went
in.
i
think
here
was
this
elderly
lady
and
they
had
a
search
warrant
in
his
pocket,
say,
"we
got
a
search
warrant,
we're
going
to
search
your
house."
said,
“go
ahead,
help
yourselves,
go
right
in."
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
then
i
think
that
they
said,
“well,
we
have
a
paper
writing
here.
you
have
to
let
us”.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
don't
know.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
don't
know.
i
gather
that
the
literacy
was
not
great
if
any.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
they
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
think
there's
a
statutory
requirement
that
it
should
be
returned.
they
hold
the
goods
return
to
keep
them
subject
to
the
order
of
the
court
file
the
return.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
but
i
don't
know
if
that
filing
--
the
filling
of
this
(inaudible),
if
in
fact
they
did
the
things
as
ordered,
would
be
requisite
to
its
validity
in
court,
the
mere
fact
that
it
did
not
been
properly
returned.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
suspect
they
took
it
back
in
through
a
van
so
they
didn't
need
warrant
at
all.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
we
had
a
sheriff
and
a
--
two
deputies
of
the
county.
they
were
accompanied
by,
i
must
say
in
all
honesty
by
agent
of
the
state
bureau
of
investigation
which
is
a
state
investigating
agents.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
of
the
record
does
not
disclose
any
existence
of
a
search
warrant
beyond
the
statement
to
the
officer
as
relayed
by
ms.leath
to
the
state
and
of
the
officer.
anything
else
i
know
is
off
the
record.
as
far
as
i
know,
it's
not
brought
up.
no
search
warrant
was
introduced
at
the
trial.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
apparently,
and
this
surprised
me,
the
only
person
that
was
put
on
the
witness
stand
was
the
lady
in
question
and
when
she
finished
talking,
the
judge
said,
“i
find
there
was
voluntary
consent”.
they
thought
she
had
said
enough.
they've
took
her
manner,
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
--
her
demeanor,
and
her
words
is
to
mean
she
consented
it.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
she
said,
part
of
what
i've
just
been
--
when
the
officers
asked
me
to
let
them
search,
well,
i
would
tell
you
what
i've
though
about,
what
went
through
my
mind.
they
didn't
tell
me
what
they're
searching
for,
what
it
was
all
about.
they
didn't
talk
to
me
at
all.
they
just
went
to
head.
i
had
in
mind
what
they
was
looking
for
and
searching
for.
and
i
felt
like
well,
whatever
they
was
looking
for,
they
had
found
it.
and
i
didn't
think
it
amount
to
anything
with
the
boy.
i
just
give
them
a
free
will
to
look
because
i
felt
like
the
boy
wasn't
guilty”.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
this?
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
in
my
opinion,
it
is
a
valid
search
warrant
but
that's
off
the
record
again.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
well
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
not
one
out
of
it.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
that
they
went
there
without
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
no,
sir.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
i
would
interpret
that
a
different
way.
i
would
say
they
told
the
lady
they
have
a
search
warrant.
they
went
back
in
the
court
and
said
we
won't
rely
on
the
search
warrant.
we
think
there
was
consent.
the
judge
who
listened
to
her
and
watched
her
on
the
witness
stand
interpreted
it
as
being
consent.
and
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
thought
that
judge
(inaudible)
findings
were
justified
by
the
record.
i
see
nothing
to
--
from
the
record
they
would
make
you
conclude
the
officers
were
lying.
there's
no
evidence
of
that.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
not
any
that
i
could
instruct
--
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
no
sir.
not
in
the
light
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
i
would
always
use
one.
if
we're
ever
to
get
by
the
consent
question,
i
have
raised
in
my
brief,
my
time
is
about
up,
considerable
question
as
to
whether
this
defendant
has
any
standing
to
challenge
this
on
the
ground
that
it
was
his
grandmother's
premises,
his
grandmother's
rifle,
he
was
not
present,
as
far
as
i
could
gather,
at
the
time
of
the
search
and
the
only
theory
i
can
think
of
would
be
whether
we
have
invaded
an
area
of
his
privacy
in
that
he
was
also
domicile
in
the
same
home.
but
we
must
remember
it
was
grandmother's
rifle
and
even
as
suggested
here,
there's
no
evidence,
members
of
the
family
had
a
free
right
to
use
grandmother's
rifle
and
she
said
it
was
her
rifle.
i
don't
believe
there's
any
implied
permission
to
take
the
rifle
and
go
after
to
commit
two
capital
offenses
of
rape
and
two
attempted
murders.
and
we
don't
think
his
area
of
privacy
was
invaded.
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
alright.
shall
i
leave
this
solicitor's
note
with
it?
mr.
harry
w.
mcgalliard
thank
you.
