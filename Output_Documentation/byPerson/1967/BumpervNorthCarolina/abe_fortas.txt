justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
a
question
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
here,
there
is
no
statute,
is
there?
justice
abe
fortas
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
--
are
you
suggesting
to
us
that
there
is
a
pattern
here
of
which
the
pattern
here
--
or
which
this
--
disqualification
as
a
pattern,
a
pattern
of
disqualification
for
this
particular
reason?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
forgive
me.
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
is
that
the
position
here
that
the
state
has
a
right
to
have
persons
in
this
category
disqualified
for
a
cause?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
a
judge
said,
“alright,
this
respective
witness
says
that
he
has
a
conscientious
scruple
against
returning
--
imposing
the
death
penalty
in
this
case”
but
nevertheless,
i
think
he
is
taking
all
and
all,
he
is
qualified
to
serve.
would
that
be
error
under
your
law
or
with
it
be
--
regardless
of
whether
you
--
there's
anything
in
the
district
prosecuting
attorney
could
do
about
it.
would
it
be
error
as
you
understand
your
law
or
would
it
merely
be
a
permissible
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
judge?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
prospective
jurors
says
that
to
his
conscientious
scruple,
he
could
not
--
against
imposing
the
death
penalty.
he
couldn't
do
it
generally.
he
can't
do
it
in
this
case,
in
any
particular
case.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
judge
nevertheless
says,
“well,
taking
it
all
and
all
i'm
going
to
overrule
the
challenge
for
cause."
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you,
how
many
people
were
executed
in
north
carolina
last
year
or
some
other
year,
do
you
know?
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
know
as
compared
with
that,
how
many
verdicts
were
returned
or
recommendations
made
or
whatever
the
correct
phrase
is
by
juries
to
--
that
the
capital
punishment
should
be
imposed
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
those
ten
years?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you,
yes,
sir.
justice
abe
fortas
there
were
--
justice
abe
fortas
there
could
have
been
more
than
two?
justice
abe
fortas
i
--
as
i
understand
mr.
smith's
argument,
it
is
to
the
effect
that
a
state
has
a
very
little
interest
as
compared
with
the
interest
of
defendants
because
of
--
you've
had
only
two
executions
in
the
last
ten
years.
and
i
supposed
that
it
would
be
arguable
that
the
state's
real
interest,
really
substantial
interest
here
may
not
be
so
much
in
obtaining
capital
punishment
as
it
is
in
selecting
jurors
who
have
a
kind
of
a
predisposition
towards
bringing
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
regardless
of
the
penalty.
now,
what
do
you
say
to
that?
is
this
a
question
in
your
judgment
and
experience?
does
this
question
with
respect
to
scruples
about
conscientious
--
about
the
attitude
towards
capital
punishment?
does
that
question
in
your
judgment
in
fact
served
to
get
into
the
jury
box
more
people
who
are
disposed
to
bring
in
a
verdict
of
guilty?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
and
i
take
it
that
implicit
in
his
argument
as
a
suggestion
that
that's
the
real
objective
or
one
of
the
real
objectives
of
the
question
about
conscientious
or
religious
scruples.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
why
do
you
suppose
the
officers
said,
“we've
got
a
search
warrant”?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
would
happen
she
has
said,
"well,
i
don't
want
you
to
search
my
house
anyway”?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
she
wasn't
able
to
read
were
she?
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
record
show?
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
wouldn't
think
it
was
quite
or
--
in
good
order
would
you
to
for
instructions
to
be
issued
to
the
sheriff
always
go
to
the
premises
with
the
search
warrant,
inform
the
occupant
that
you
have
a
search
warrant.
if
the
occupant
then
says,
“alright,
go
ahead
and
search
and
don't
use
a
warrant”.
that
wouldn't
be
very
good
practice
for
any
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
have
the
fourth
amendment?
sir?
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
a

a

of
disqualification

this
particular
reason?

fortas
well,

me.
