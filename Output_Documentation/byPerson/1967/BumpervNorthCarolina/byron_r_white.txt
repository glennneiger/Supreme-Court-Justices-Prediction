justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
in
the
terms
of
the
type
--
in
the
terms
of
the
type
of
person
that
is
left
on
the
jury
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
(inaudible)
are
excluded?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what's
the
--
what
interest
did
the
defendant
has
violated
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
under
the
consti
–
justice
byron
r.
white
--
what
caused
the
constitution
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
deprivation
of
an
impartial
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
just
like
to
--
you
should
finish
your
answer
with
my
question
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
if
you
don't
mind.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
--
i
just
want
to
know
what
provision
of
the
constitution
you're
claiming
--
this
isn't
a
sixth
amendment
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
was
it
a
due
process
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
is
it
an
equal
protection
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
falls
down
to
the
same
argument,
i
guess,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
point,
i
gather,
is
a
narrow
one
that
there
could've
been
no
consent
in
the
circumstances
that
the
officers
represented
to
her
insofar
as
this
record
is
concerned,
this
hasn't
been
substantiated
that
they
had
a
warrant
which
authorized
them
to
come
and
that
her
consent
was
worst
to
what
word
you
used.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
by
this
representation,
is
that
it?
i
think
that's
the
point.
and
even
if
leaving
that
aside,
i
think
the,
circumstances
of
the
case
were
such
that
given
her
isolation,
age,
sex,
race
and
so
forth
that
you
have
a
clear
case
of
implied
coercion.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
rule
--
justice
byron
r.
white
were
they
all
present
when
the
others
were
questioned?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
that
as
to
those
two,
there
was
a
constitutional
error?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
i
understand,
mr.
galliard
--
mcgalliard,
we
have
--
this
is
on
the
premise
that
in
effect
your
court
decisions
have
said
that
this
is
a
problem
tailored
made
to
the
particular
case
and
the
particular
veniremen
and
that
the
exclusion
is
only
on
the
situation
where
it
is
in
fact
developed
that
the
veniremen
--
and
he
says,
“and
under
no
circumstances
could
i
impose
a
death
penalty."
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
suggest
that
in
this
case,
as
to
all
but
two
at
least,
that's
in
fact
the
course
of
the
inquiry
took
of
the
respective
jurors.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
suggest
--
you
suggest
that,
as
i
understand
it,
that
in
that
posture
both
of
your
law
and
but
actually
happened
in
this
case,
that
precludes
any
constitutional
area
placed
on
a
theory
of
systematic
exclusion?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
but
aren't
--
their
other
--
their
two
other
propositions
that
are
suggested,
i
think,
by
mr.
smith.
the
due
process
argument
that
this
goes
to
the
infection
of
the
find
--
fact-finding
process
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
the
other
is
the
sixth
amendment
argument,
fair
trial.
or
are
they
all
the
same
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
independently?
not
independently
of
the
systematic
exclusion
in
order
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
that
--
if
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
are
to
understand
him
as
saying
that
independently
of
a
systematic
exclusion,
equal
protection
argument,
i
rely
on
these
other
two,
what's
your
answer
to
those?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
any
of
these
put
in
evidence
in
this
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
filed
--
they
were
--
it
didn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
was
no
--
these
people
hadn't
appeared
personally
or
something
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
published?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
must
be
just
about
the
best
authority
in
north
carolina.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
that
letter,
a
little
--
the
last
part
of
that
little
fast.
i
didn't
get
the
last.
justice
byron

yes.
justice
byron

yes.
