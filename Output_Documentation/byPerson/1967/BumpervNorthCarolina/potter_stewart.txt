justice
potter
stewart
who
imposes
the
penalty
in
north
carolina?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
judge
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
jury
comes
in
with
the
death
penalty,
the
judge
must
impose
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
suppose
they
come
in
with
the
first
degree
and
whatever
the
felony
may
be,
do
they
then
have
an
option
to
give
life
or
death?
justice
potter
stewart
they
do.
and
then
they
may
also
bring
in
a
lesser
--
a
verdict
of
--
for
lesser
included
offense
and
then
what,
impose
the
term
of
years?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
begin,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understood
correctly
what
i
--
i
thought
i
understood
you
to
acknowledge
and
concede
yesterday
and
that
is
that
in
this
case,
there
was
sufficient
opportunity
for
interrogation
of
the
venary
of
the
respective
jurors
so
that
the
challenges
for
cause
were
allowed
only
for
those
respective
jurors
who
said
that
in
this
case
they
could
not
return
a
verdict
of
death,
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
do
you
concede
that?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
so
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
is
a
different
case
in
that
respect
from
the
illinois
case
here?
justice
potter
stewart
yet
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
it's
not
that
--
i
must
say
i
misunderstand
you.
it's
not
that
they
tell
the
judge
that
they
would
not
convict.
they
should
tell
the
judge
that
they
would
not
impose
the
death
sentence,
isn't
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
--
what
if
--
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
that
arises
in
your
jurisdiction
because
unlike
some
jurisdictions
where
a
finding
of
guilt
of
certain
offenses
results
automatically
in
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty,
in
your
jurisdiction,
it's
up
to
the
jury
to
select
the
penalty
to
be
imposed
with
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
certain
rather
broad
limitations.
what
is
the
jury's
function?
this
is
a
rape
case
in
north
carolina,
now
what
can
the
jury
do
after
finding
the
defendant
guilty?
then
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
discretion
is
allowed
the
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
(voice
overlap)
they
find
him
guilty
--
justice
potter
stewart
then
what
do
they
do?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
it's
a
recommendation
of
mercy,
then
the
court
does
not
have
any
power
to
impose
the
death
penalty?
justice
potter
stewart
if
there's
no
recommendation
of
mercy,
does
it
--
is
the
court
required
to
impose
the
death
penalty?
justice
potter
stewart
required
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
if
there's
no
recommendation
of
mercy
then
what
discretion
does
the
court
have,
the
judge
have?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
on
the
conviction
for
rape,
the
most
lenient
sentence
that
can
be
imposed
is
imprisonment
for
life,
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
has
this
situation
never
is
in
your
state
a
jury
in
a
rape
case
returns
to
the
judge,
were
unanimously
agreed
that
the
defendant
is
guilty
but
we
cannot
reach
agreement
on
whether
or
not
to
recommend
the
life
sentence
or
recommend
mercy
i
gather
is
your
language?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
what
happens
then?
has
that
happened,
number
one?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
what
does
happen
there?
is
there
a
mistrial?
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
your
reasons
for
suggesting
that
your
client
doesn't
get
a
fair
trial
when
these
jurors
were
excluded
--
are
excluded
for
these
reason,
which
is
--
relates
only
on
the
penalty?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
that
cuts
both
ways,
i
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
smith,
you
have
a
very
interesting
and
important
second
point
in
this
case.
i
hope
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
i
hope
you're
taking
your
time
to
get
to
it.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
if
the
woman
said
this
was
her
rifle?
justice
potter
stewart
she
was
--
it's
her
home
and
it's
her
rifle.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
read
in
the
record.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
its
misrepresentation,
isn't
it?
it's
something
akin
to
fraud.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
jury's
recommendation
was
of
mercy?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it's
an
explicit
recommendation
by
the
jury
of
life
imprisonment?
justice
potter
stewart
and
otherwise,
it's
mandatory
that
he
impose
the
death
sentence,
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
they
didn't?
justice
potter
stewart
serve
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you
said
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
about
the
first
thing
they
said,
they
had
a
search
warrant.
justice
potter
stewart
so
a
little
different
to
be
cooperative
and
agreeable
when
you've
told
by
the
officers
they
have
a
search
warrant.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
when
you
didn't
--
when
they
didn't
have
one.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
there's
plenty
of
indication
of
that,
isn't
there?
justice
potter
stewart
if
we
just
stuck
to
the
record,
that's
what
the
record
shows.
justice
potter
stewart
that
there
was
misrepresentation.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
think
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
who
imposes
the
penalty
in
north
carolina?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
judge

justice
