chief

mr.
smith,
we've
arrived
at
our
adjournment
time
but
before
we
do
adjourn,
i
would
like
to
say
to
you
as
i
should
have
said
to
in
the
prior
case,
to
mr.
jetter
(ph),
which
i
say
to
him
now,
that
this
court
appreciates
very
much
the
fact
that
you
in
this
case
and
he
and
his
associates
in
the
prior
case
have
served
an
innocent
and
an
indigent
defendant,
a
matter
in
which
you
have.
we
consider
that
a
great
public
service
and
consider
that
it
is
a
credit
to
the
bar
which
you
represent
so
we
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl

we
thank
you
all
for
what
you've
done.
we'll

mr.
smith,
you
may
continue
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
under
--
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
justice
black's
question.
justice
black,
i
thought,
asked
you
if
a
juror
said
that
he
could
not
bring
in
a
capital
verdict
in
this
or
any
other
case
because
of
his
conscientious
subjections,
and
you
said
that
you
thought
in
those
circumstances
that
there
would
be
error
for
the
court
to
excuse
him
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
means
it's
a
capital
verdict,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
more
question
about
this,
mr.
smith.
in
your
state,
for
a
juror
to
qualify,
must
he
say
that
he
would
be
willing
to
set
aside
any
preconceived
ideas
that
he
might
have
of
the
law
and
follow
the
instructions
of
the
court
as
to
the
law
not
withstanding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
could
a
man
who
said,
“i
will
under
no
circumstances
bring
in
a
capital
verdict”
if
the
judge
instructs
him
that
this
is
a
proper
case
in
which
such
a
verdict
can
be
brought
in
under
the
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
have
five
minutes
more
mr.
smith.
you

chief

was

chief

had

chief

warren
had
you
finished
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcgalliard,
before
we
get
to
that,
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question
in
the
procedure.
as
i
understood
mr.
smith,
it
is
his
belief
that
if
the
jury
could
not
agree
on
whether
there
should
be
the
death
penalty
or
life
imprisonment
should
be
imposed
that
the
defendant
would
be
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
i
understood
him
say
that
for
instance
if
one
juror
held
out
against
capital
punishment
that
that
would
have
to
result
in
a
new
trial.
is
that
the
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
you
could
enlighten
us
any
by
researching
that
somewhat
more?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
make
a
return
of
this
search
warrant
in
due
course?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
did
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
--
was
that
--
this
is
not
a
record
of
the
court
then
in
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
tell
me
where
in
the
record
she
said,
“you
don't
need
any
search
warrant
for
me”.is
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
as
far
as
you
know,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
says
that
they
didn't
need
that
search
warrant.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
isn't
there
--
there
is
quite
a
difference
between
saying,
“you
didn't
have
to
have
any
search
warrant”
on
the
one
hand
and
saying,
after
they
told
her
that
they
had
a
search
warrant,
saying
“well,
i
have
no
objection
to
you,
to
you
searching
my
place”
there's
quite
a
difference
between

well,
under
your
law,
must
a
search
warrant
be
returned

return
to

why
wouldn't
they
return
it
when
they
did
take
a

and
took
some
other
things,
why
wouldn't
they
return
it
to

about
it?

what
did

officers
say
at

trial
as

would
you
