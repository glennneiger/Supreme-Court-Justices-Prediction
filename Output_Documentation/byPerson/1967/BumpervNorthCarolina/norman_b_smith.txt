mr.
norman
b.
smith
thank
you,
mr.
--
your
honor.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioner
in
this
case
of
bumper
versus
the
state
of
north
carolina.
it
comes
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina.
it
originated
there
or
came
there
as
a
direct
appeal
from
a
conviction
in
one
of
our
superior
courts
of
one
of
our
counties
in
north
carolina.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
on
october
of
1966
on
a
capital
bill
of
rape.
the
jury
recommended
mercy,
however,
and
so
he
was
not
given
the
death
sentence.
he
was
also
convicted
in
the
same
proceeding
on
two
indictments
of
aggravated
assault.
he
was
sentenced
to
serve
two-year
--
two
ten-year
sentences,
plus
a
life
sentence
in
the
state
prison.
the
questions
which
are
before
the
court
are
two.
one
of
the
questions
is
almost
identical
to
the
one
involved
in
the
witherspoon
case.
that
is
namely
the
constitutionality
of
the
exclusion
of
jurors
who
have
conscientious
scruples
against
the
death
penalty,
on
due
process,
equal
protection
and
impartial
jury
grounds.
the
second
question
involves
a
search
and
seizure
matter.
the
state
searched
the
premises
where
the
defendant
live
with
his
grandmother
and
there
seized
a
riffle,
they
did
so
purporting
to
act
under
a
warrant.
at
the
trial
of
the
petitioner
however,
the
solicitor
or
prosecuting
officer
chose
to
rely
solely
on
what
he
said
was
the
voluntary
consent
of
the
petitioner's
grandmother
to
the
seizure
of
this
rifle.
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
affirmed
on
that
ground
both
of
the
questions
at
bar
in
this
court
were
presented
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
and
there's
no
question
about
the
petitioner's
having
raised
this
questions
in
apt
time
both
at
the
trial
in
the
appellate
levels.
now,
the
matter
involving
the
first
question
of
the
conscientious
scruples
against
the
death
penalty
has
been
of
course
very
thoroughly
and
ably
explored
by
counsel
in
the
preceding
case.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
most
of
my
time
to
argue
on
the
search
and
seizure
question
but
i
have
a
few
matters
of
impression
on
the
conscientious
scruples
issue
which
i
would
like
to
discuss
with
the
court
if
the
court
pleases.
now,
to
begin
with,
this
case
differs
from
the
witherspoon
case
in
that
my
client,
his
trial
was
permitted
to
ask
plenty
of
questions
to
the
prospective
jurors.
the
judge
himself
asked
lots
of
questions.
and
i
think
there's
only
really
the
case
of
maybe
one
or
two
prospective
jurors
on
the
voir
dire
who
were
not
quite
thoroughly
gone
over
on
this
question
of
whether
they
had
conscientious
scruples
against
the
death
penalty.
i
think
quite
clearly
from
the
record
that
the
jurors
understood
what
it
was
and
they
were
asked
if
they
could
impose
in
any
case
and
if
they
said
they
could
impose
it
in
any
case
or
a
proper
case,
ordinarily
the
court
permitted
them
to
sit
on
the
jury.
so,
in
the
bumper
case,
we
face
the
question
head
on
and
we
present
the
broader
question
which
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
case
of
crawford
v.
brown,
the
four
justices
who
represented
the
majority
position
of
the
court
chose
to
use
in
setting
aside
the
conviction
of
crawford
in
that
case,
namely
the
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
sir,
it's
a
different
side
of
the
same
question.
as
i
understand
it,
mr.--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
there
are
two
--
i
guess
two
subdivisions
there.
one
is
whether
under
any
of
the
circumstances,
he
would
award
the
death
penalty.
and
two
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
--
whether
under
any
circumstances,
you
would
convict.
and
yes,
sir,
i'm
--
it
appears
to
me
from
the
record
that
the
defendant
was
permitted
to
find
out
if
the
jurors
would
ever
give
the
death
penalty.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
no,
sir,
i
do
not.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir.
in
this
respect
your
honor,
a
second
question
should
be
asked.
once
they
say
they
have
conscientious
scruples
against
the
death
penalty
and
will
not
return
a
death
verdict,
they
should
then
be
asked,
"can
you,
under
these
circumstances,
give
the
state
and
the
defendant
a
fair
trial
on
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence?"
if
they
will
reply
on
the
affirmative
on
that,
that
is
if
they
say
they
can
give
a
fair
trial
on
the
primary
question
at
bar,
then
they
should
be
allowed
to
sit
on
the
jury.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
it's
done
by
the
jury,
your
honor.
incidentally,
the
u.s.
v.
jackson
case
will
probably
have
rather
profound
effect
on
our
practice
because
a
guilty
plea
automatically
gives
you
a
license
to
plead
not
guilty,
risk
your
life
on
the
jury
in
its
discretion
imposes
either
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
--
death
or
life.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
the
judge
is
bound,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
i
think
in
all
--
virtually
all
of
our
capital
offenses,
we
have
well,
four
primary
--
we
have
burglary,
rape,
arson
and
murder.
this
is
a
rape
case.
i
think
we
have
some
minor
ones
which
are
not
used
very
much,
insurrection
or
something
like
that.
but
--
in
these
cases,
i
think
almost
all
of
them
have
lesser
included
offenses.
here,
the
jury,
i
think
was
charged
with
or
4
or
5
lesser
included
non-capital
offenses.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
it's
up
to
the
judge
on
what
terms
of
years
would
be
imposed.
if
they
bring
in
recommendation
of
mercy
after
having
convicted
of
the
first
degree
offense
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
--
then
the
judge
is
bound
to
give
a
life
sentence.
in
all
other
cases,
the
judge
has
discretion
within
the
statutory
limit,
usually
it's
just
a
plain
old
common
law
felony
and
he
could
give
anything
from
any
amount
of
time
up
to
ten
years
in
the
state's
prison.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
afternoon,
at
closing
time
i
think
i
had
made
the
proposition
that
the
challenge
for
a
cause
should
be
limited
only
to
people
who
say
they
cannot
give
either
the
state
or
the
defendant
a
fair
trial.
that
only
those
people
should
be
kept
off
the
jury.
now
i'd
like
to
state
my
reasons
for
this
proposition.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
your
honor
that's
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
that
is
my
opinion
and
i
really
--
i
don't
attempt
to
make
the
question
any
broader
than
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
--
what
i've
just
stated.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
of
course,
that
issue,
i
suppose
could
be
reached
in
the
illinois
case
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
--
but
this
is
really,
i
think
a
--
were
confronted
of,
i
believe
here
with
the
collision
course
really
between
the
right
of
the
state
to
seek
the
death
penalty
and
what
we
contend
to
be
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
seek
a
fair
trial.
now
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
no,
sir.
there's
a
long
line
of
cases
in
north
carolina
and
beginning,
i
believe
about
1870
the
earliest
one
of
which
is
cited
in
petitioner's
brief
and
we're
concerned
only
with
the
common
law
disqualification.
a
really
common
law
is
not
the
right
word
either
because
i
contend
there
was
no
disqualification
of
the
common
law
but
it
is
a
court-made
rule
enforced
in
north
carolina.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
and
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
i
certainly
think
so.
the
first
point,
i
believe,
is
it
--
that
it's
numerically
significant.
now,
the
attorney
general
of
north
carolina
stipulated
or
conceded
in
the
case
of
crawford
v.
(inaudible)
that
30%
of
our
citizens
in
north
carolina
would
be
challengeable
for
a
cause
on
this
ground,
on
the
ground
of
conscientious
subjection
to
the
death
penalty.
i
presume
that
elsewhere
in
the
united
states,
the
statistics
are
pretty
much
the
same.
certainly
from
the
(inaudible)
post
and
the
other
indices
available
to
us
are
--
this
is
not
an
unreasonable
figure
keeping
in
mind
that
some
of
those
who
at
the
outset
say
they
are
opposed
which
is
something
like
half
of
our
population
may
as
the
study
cited
by
mr.
jenner
(ph)
yesterday
made
by
professor
zeisel
indicates,
these
people
when
really
put
to
the
test
of
a
heinous
or
atrocious
crime
might
back
down
and
be
willing
to
invoke
the
death
penalty.
but
i
think
that
30%
figure
is
a
fair
figure
for
north
carolina
since
it's
conceded
by
my
adversary.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
i
think
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
if
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
your
honor.
is
it
--
you
mean
if
a
prospective
juror
says
that
he
could
do
it
in
some
cases
but
not
in
all
cases
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
oh,
i
think
that
would
be
error.
and
although
i
haven't
researched
the
question,
my
often
opinion
would
be
that
the
state
could
have
the
error
reversed
by
the
supreme
court
although
appeals
by
the
state
are
very
nearly
limited
in
north
carolina
in
criminal
cases
not
--
without
researching
the
point,
i'd
hesitate
to
say.
but
if
he
recognize
this
error
whether
or
not
the
state
could
procure
a
reversal
is
something
i
noted
mr.
mcgalliard
could
answer
more
correctly
than
i
can.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir.
well
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
that's
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
that
second
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
the
second
question
is
not
asked
under
our
practice
and
it's
my
contention
that
that
second
question
is
the
vital
question
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
now
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
my
contention
is
that
the
vital
question
is
the
second
question
of
whether
or
not
in
spite
or
your
scruples
you
could
go
on
and
give
both
the
state
and
the
defendant
a
fair
trial
on
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence.
if
you
can
do
that
in
spite
of
your
scruples
we
contend
the
juror
should
be
ceded
and
no
challenge
for
cause
should
be
allowed
because
we
believe
that
the
right
of
a
fair
trail
attaches
on
this
primary
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
and
the
state's
right
to
seek
the
death
penalty
must
be
subordinated
to
that.
now
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
by
capital
verdict,
i
understood
mr.
justice
black
to
mean
a
verdict
of
guilty
without
recommendation
of
mercy.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
but
i'm
trying
to
distinguish
between
the
jury's
function
in
recommending
or
not
recommending
mercy.
that
is
determining
whether
or
not
there
will
be
like
imprisonment
and
its
function
of
adjudicating
guilt
or
innocence.
and
if
this
juror,
this
prospective
juror
said
that
he
could
give
the
state
and
the
defendant
a
fair
trial
on
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence,
in
spite
of
his
scruples
against
death
--
the
death
penalty,
then
he
should
be
ceded.
even
though
he
says
in
no
case
can
i
impose
the
death
penalty
and
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
been
demonstrated
that
in
many
instances,
a
juror
who
has
opposed
to
the
death
penalty
would
nevertheless
be
willing
to
vote
on
the
guilt
or
innocence
issue
where
the
--
with
a
free
and
impartial
mind
in
accordance
with
the
instructions
given
by
the
judge.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
then,
at
that
point,
your
honor,
a
second
question
must
be
asked
to
the
juror.
he
must
be
asked,
“in
spite
of
your
scruples
against
the
death
penalty,
can
you,
on
the
issue
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
that
he
could
not
give
the
state
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
your
honor,
i
still
think
that's
a
different
question
because
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir,
but
i
think
they
have
to
ask
them
another
question.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
it's
been
my
feeling
all
along
your
honor.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
it's
set
out
very
clearly
in
my
reply
brief,
your
honor.
the
entire
section
4
beginning
on
page
10
is
directed
to
that
exact
problem.
i
think
i
have
some
reasons
that
would
support
this
position
and
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
indeed,
that's
the
holding
in
the
case
of
crawford
v.
(inaudible)
so
it's
not
without
some
authority.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
oh,
i
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
the
jury
then,
i
assume
--
i've
been
in
a
jury
room
but
i
assume
they
find
him
guilty
or
innocent
first
and
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
--
assuming
they
find
him
guilt
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
--
guilty.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
then
they
go
on
and
consider
whether
they
will
recommend
mercy.
that's
the
language
we
used,
“recommend
mercy”
and
this
recommendation
is
binding
on
the
court.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
and
it
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
is
without
discretion
in
that
case
so
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
none.
he
must
sentence
to
life
imprisonment.
this
is
not
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
sir.
and
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
sir,
for
rape.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
now,
there
are
lesser
included
offenses
and
as
a
general
rule,
indeed
in
this
case,
the
judge
will
charge
with
lesser
included
offenses:
assault
on
a
female,
assault
on
battering,
so
forth
and
so
on.
and
these
instances,
of
course,
you
get
usually
the
ten-year
maximum
of
--
for
felony
imprisonment.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
and
they
stay
stuck
on
that.
you
mean
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
that
has
not
happened.
there
is
dictum
by
our
supreme
court
that
we
would
follow
the
ambrose
case
decided
by
this
court,
decided
in
the
briefs
here
requiring
unanimity
on
both
issues.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
a
mistrial.
and
there
are
other
alternatives
to
this
result
which
i
would
suggest
are
avenues
that
the
state
can
pursue
in
the
event
that
petitioner
is
awarded
the
relief
which
he
request.
i
think
for
instance
you
can
require
the
--
be
reversed
that
there'd
be
a
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir,
i
am.
i
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
i
would
suggest,
your
honor
that
he
would
still
feel
himself
free
to
join
with
the
other
jurors
and
find
the
defendant
guilty.
and
then
when
it
comes
to
the
penalty
phase
of
the
deliberations,
he
would
refuse
to
join
the
other
jurors
in
failing
to
recommend
mercy
and
he
would
come
back
in
and
possibly
hung
the
jury.
on
the
other
hand,
it's
possible
that
he
could
be
talked
out
of
this
position.
and
i
--
of
course,
if
the
mechanics
of
the
jury,
the
deliberation
process
are
still
i
suppose
quite
much
of
a
mystery,
i
don't
think
we
know
a
lot
about
it.
but
it
appears
from
the
results
in
cases
that
hung
jurors
are
relatively
few
when
it
--
it's
either
some
kind
of
a
compromise
that's
worked
out
such
as
a
lesser
included
offense
possibly
or
the
moral
persuasion
of
the
majority
and
finally
bends
the
will
of
the
minority
on
the
jury.
i
think
this
is
a
usual
thing.
it
happens
all
the
time.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir.
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
i
point
out
that
it's
a
large
group.
and
secondly,
i
tried
--
attempt
the
juxtapose
the
interest
of
the
state,
which
i
say
is
relatively
slight
in
it
that
for
few
executions
are
ever
carried
out
and
this
interest
of
the
state
is
a
very,
very
small
one.
they
only
executed
one
person
say
in
1966
in
a
handful
in
the
few
years
proceedings.
and
so
we
rely
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir.
we
rely
on
this
studies,
i
crossed
on
wilson,
goldberg
and
zeisel
coincidentally
which
are
to
some
extent
in
the
public
domain,
i
realized
that
was
questioned
yesterday
but
they
have
been
cited
on
the
basis
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
but
the
very
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
i
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
think
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
our
claim,
it's
an
equal
protection
violation
and
a
due
process
violation
and
a
deprivation
of
the
impartial
jury
right.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
and
the
important
thing
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
your
honor.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i'm
going
to
move
on
if
i
may
only
say
one
more
thing.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
the
important
thing
about
these
studies
is
the
--
you
don't
have
to
accept
or
to
prove
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir.
we
claim
three
things,
your
honor:
the
sixth
amendment,
which
is
applicable
to
the
states
and
in
accordance
with
this
court's
decision
in
parker
versus
gladden
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause;
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
because
the
fact-finding
process
itself,
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process
is
impugned.
and
we
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
by
the
exclusion
of
jurors
who
are
likely,
who
are
less
likely
to
be
prosecution
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
it's
a
very
related
question,
your
honor,
but
it's
an
exclusion
of
a
class
of
jurors
which
is
injurious
to
the
defendant.
i
think
the
important
thing
in
it
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
i
think
it
does.
i
think
these
are
related
arguments.
i
think
that's
what
the
fourth
circuit
ultimately
determined.
i
guess
i
better
talk
about
the
search
and
seizure
for
in
the
moment.
the
defendant
was
arrested
on
the
day
after
the
search.
i
made
a
misstatement
of
that
fact
in
the
brief.
i
said
the
--
vice-versa
but
the
search
was
before
the
arrest.
the
defendant
lives
with
his
grandmother
who
was
a
66
years
old
negro
widow
who
lived
at
the
end
of
a
one
mile
dirt
road
in
the
rural
section
of
alamance
county,
north
carolina.
i've
been
down
that
road
and
it's
quite
generous
to
call
it
a
road
because
it's
a
pretty
rough
track.
the
point
i
suppose,
is
it
is
an
isolated
place
and
at
the
time
the
officers
came,
four
of
them
and
four
sheriffs
in
a
sheriff's
car,
all
white,
the
grandmother
was
--
at
the
house
along
with
some
of
her
infant
grandchildren
not
including
the
defendant
who
was
18
but
some
younger
children
and
her
adult
son
was
away
from
the
house.
these
officers
came
up
to
the
door.
this
woman
is
elderly
and
i
think
that
if
--
from
reading
the
record,
you
can
indicate
--
the
record
indicates
she's
deficient
in
education.
and
the
officers
pulled
out
some
kind
of
a
paper
and
presented
it
to
her
instead
they
had
a
warrant
or
a
notice
or
something.
she
called
it
a
warrant
on
one
occasion,
notice
on
the
other
for
searching
her
premises.
they
didn't
explain
why
they
were
searching
or
on
what
connection
and
she
acquiescently
opened
the
door
and
stepped
aside
and
said,
“alright,
come
in,
you
may
search”
and
they
did.
and
they
looked
around
in
the
house
and
found
in
the
kitchen,
which
was
a
common
room
of
the
house,
a
rifle,
which
was
a
common
article
of
the
household.
i
suggest
owned
and
possessed
among
all
the
individuals
in
the
household
including
the
defendant.
this
rifle
was
seized
and
taken
and
it
later
became
material
evidence
in
the
case.
they
also
stripped
some
of
the
clothing
of
one
of
the
14
year
old
grandson
who
was
present.
his
clothing,
however,
was
later
returned
and
not
used
in
the
trial.
incidentally,
it
didn't
match
the
kind
of
clothing
that
the
defendant
supposedly
wore
on
the
occasion
in
question
anyway.
this
matter
was
brought
up
to
trial
by
a
motion
to
suppress
and
i
tendered
an
affidavit
by
the
grandmother
explaining
these
things
which
i
have
just
set
out,
this
one.
and
then
attended
to
her
as
a
witness
and
she
was
cross-examined
by
the
solicitor
and
in
--
on
a
redirect
and
i
supposed,
would
say
i
examined
her
again
and
she
testified
to
me
the
essential
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
no,
sir.
the
piece
of
paper
is
nowhere
in
the
record
and
what
the
solicitor
did,
and
it
could
be
found
on
page
43
of
the
appendix
of
the
--
the
solicitor
said
to
the
judge
--
i
see
my
time
is
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
solicitor
said
that
the
court
of
the
state
is
not
relying
on
the
search
warrant
and
the
court
said,
“are
you
so
stating
for
the
record”
and
the
solicitor
said,
“yes,
sir”.
and
then
i
said,
“then
we're
concerned
only
with
consent”
and
the
court
indicated
we
were.
so
the
warrant
was
never
introduced,
not
part
of
the
record.
and
the
solicitor
never
at
any
time
relied
on
it.
yet,
i
contend
that
the
officers
relied
on
it
at
the
time
they
made
the
search.
this
woman
thought
she
was
yielding
to
a
search
by
warrant,
an
official
warrant,
brought
by
officers
of
the
law.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
the
court
found
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
that
there
was
voluntary
consent
to
the
search
and
it
was
upheld
by
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir,
i
certainly
do.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
i
don't
raise
that
point,
your
honor.
i'm
inclined
to
think
that
she
could.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
and
the
children,
of
course,
live
in
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
and
the
children
of
course
used
the
rifle
and
lived
in
the
home.
they
went
out
hunting
rabbits
with
it
and
shooting
to
scare
off
the
mule
and
things
like
that
which
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
don't
think
it's
a
sound
--
that
my
personal
opinion
is
that
it's
not
a
sound
point.
i
say
unquestionably
there
is
standing
for
the
petitioner
to
raise
the
issue.
but
i
do
think
that
the
woman
had
the
right
to
consent
since
it
was
her
house.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
i
argued
that
in
the
brief
and
i
say
that
is
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
sir?
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
sir,
it
was
never
introduced.
i'm
going
beyond
the
record
now
to
say
that
there
was
a
paper
writing
which
purported
to
be
a
warrant.
i
don't
know.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
issued
by
a
magistrate.
and
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
valid
or
not.
i
argued
--
i
submitted
a
brief
attacking
its
validity.
and
apparently,
the
solicitor
felt
that
it
wasn't
any
good
because
he
didn't
use
it
at
the
trial.
he
quit
it
and
went
off
on
consent.
i
suppose
if
he
had
any
faith
in
his
warrant,
he
would've
presented
it
to
the
trial
court,
it
would
be
a
part
of
the
record
but
it's
not.
and
i'm
going
beyond
the
record
to
say
this
but
those
are
the
facts
as
i
find
the
case
and
i
know.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
think
semi
illiterate,
your
honor,
although
again
unfortunately,
that
doesn't
appear
from
the
record.
i
can
say
that
that
reading,
the
dialogue,
reading
the
testimony
would
indicate
that
she
was
not
an
educated
person.
she
clearly
didn't
have
any
conception
of
constitutional
law
or
political
science
or
matters
of
that
nature.
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court
that
mapp
versus
ohio
is
being
evaded
and
detoured
perhaps
by
the
excessive
use
of
this
device
of
the
consensual
search.
and
if
the
exclusionary
rule
which
this
court
put
--
lay
down
in
mapp
is
to
be
preserved
that
the
case
is
such
as
amos
and
johnson
versus
united
states
must
be
declared
fourteenth
amendment
law,
a
fourteenth
amendment
law
and
made
applicable
to
the
states.
taking
a
phrase
from
the
case
of
johnson
v.
united
states
granted
in
submission
to
authority
rather
than
as
an
understanding
in
the
intentional
waiver
of
the
constitutional
right.
clearly,
i
think
you
--
epitomizes
the
behavior
of
the
woman
under
these
circumstances.
and
i
don't
think
her
testimony,
which
is
somewhat
confused
and
earning
a
heat
of
the
courtroom
proceedings
and
under
a
rather
stiff
cross-examination.
it
was
a
crowded
courtroom
of
a
controversial
case.
it
takes
a
lot
of
pressure.
i
don't
think
that
this
can
be
deemed
conclusive.
so
for
these
reasons,
the
petitioner
respectfully
prays
that
the
court
to
set
aside
the
conviction
of
the
petitioner
and
order
that
he
be
granted
a
new
trial.
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
i
thank
the
court
for
hearing
the
case.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
thank
you,
mr.
--
your
honor.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioner
in
this
case
of
bumper
versus
the
state
of
north
carolina.
it
comes
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina.
it
originated
there
or
came
there
as
a
direct
appeal
from
a
conviction
in
one
of
our
superior
courts
of
one
of
our
counties
in
north
carolina.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
on
october
of
1966
on
a
capital
bill
of
rape.
the
jury
recommended
mercy,
however,
and
so
he
was
not
given
the
death
sentence.
he
was
also
convicted
in
the
same
proceeding
on
two
indictments
of
aggravated
assault.
he
was
sentenced
to
serve
two-year
--
two
ten-year
sentences,
plus
a
life
sentence
in
the
state
prison.
the
questions
which
are
before
the
court
are
two.
one
of
the
questions
is
almost
identical
to
the
one
involved
in
the
witherspoon
case.
that
is
namely
the
constitutionality
of
the
exclusion
of
jurors
who
have
conscientious
scruples
against
the
death
penalty,
on
due
process,
equal
protection
and
impartial
jury
grounds.
the
second
question
involves
a
search
and
seizure
matter.
the
state
searched
the
premises
where
the
defendant
live
with
his
grandmother
and
there
seized
a
riffle,
they
did
so
purporting
to
act
under
a
warrant.
at
the
trial
of
the
petitioner
however,
the
solicitor
or
prosecuting
officer
chose
to
rely
solely
on
what
he
said
was
the
voluntary
consent
of
the
petitioner's
grandmother
to
the
seizure
of
this
rifle.
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
affirmed
on
that
ground
both
of
the
questions
at
bar
in
this
court
were
presented
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
and
there's
no
question
about
the
petitioner's
having
raised
this
questions
in
apt
time
both
at
the
trial
in
the
appellate
levels.
now,
the
matter
involving
the
first
question
of
the
conscientious
scruples
against
the
death
penalty
has
been
of
course
very
thoroughly
and
ably
explored
by
counsel
in
the
preceding
case.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
most
of
my
time
to
argue
on
the
search
and
seizure
question
but
i
have
a
few
matters
of
impression
on
the
conscientious
scruples
issue
which
i
would
like
to
discuss
with
the
court
if
the
court
pleases.
now,
to
begin
with,
this
case
differs
from
the
witherspoon
case
in
that
my
client,
his
trial
was
permitted
to
ask
plenty
of
questions
to
the
prospective
jurors.
the
judge
himself
asked
lots
of
questions.
and
i
think
there's
only
really
the
case
of
maybe
one
or
two
prospective
jurors
on
the
voir
dire
who
were
not
quite
thoroughly
gone
over
on
this
question
of
whether
they
had
conscientious
scruples
against
the
death
penalty.
i
think
quite
clearly
from
the
record
that
the
jurors
understood
what
it
was
and
they
were
asked
if
they
could
impose
in
any
case
and
if
they
said
they
could
impose
it
in
any
case
or
a
proper
case,
ordinarily
the
court
permitted
them
to
sit
on
the
jury.
so,
in
the
bumper
case,
we
face
the
question
head
on
and
we
present
the
broader
question
which
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
case
of
crawford
v.
brown,
the
four
justices
who
represented
the
majority
position
of
the
court
chose
to
use
in
setting
aside
the
conviction
of
crawford
in
that
case,
namely
the
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
sir,
it's
a
different
side
of
the
same
question.
as
i
understand
it,
mr.--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
there
are
two
--
i
guess
two
subdivisions
there.
one
is
whether
under
any
of
the
circumstances,
he
would
award
the
death
penalty.
and
two
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
--
whether
under
any
circumstances,
you
would
convict.
and
yes,
sir,
i'm
--
it
appears
to
me
from
the
record
that
the
defendant
was
permitted
to
find
out
if
the
jurors
would
ever
give
the
death
penalty.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
no,
sir,
i
do
not.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir.
in
this
respect
your
honor,
a
second
question
should
be
asked.
once
they
say
they
have
conscientious
scruples
against
the
death
penalty
and
will
not
return
a
death
verdict,
they
should
then
be
asked,
"can
you,
under
these
circumstances,
give
the
state
and
the
defendant
a
fair
trial
on
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence?"
if
they
will
reply
on
the
affirmative
on
that,
that
is
if
they
say
they
can
give
a
fair
trial
on
the
primary
question
at
bar,
then
they
should
be
allowed
to
sit
on
the
jury.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
it's
done
by
the
jury,
your
honor.
incidentally,
the
u.s.
v.
jackson
case
will
probably
have
rather
profound
effect
on
our
practice
because
a
guilty
plea
automatically
gives
you
a
license
to
plead
not
guilty,
risk
your
life
on
the
jury
in
its
discretion
imposes
either
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
--
death
or
life.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
the
judge
is
bound,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
i
think
in
all
--
virtually
all
of
our
capital
offenses,
we
have
well,
four
primary
--
we
have
burglary,
rape,
arson
and
murder.
this
is
a
rape
case.
i
think
we
have
some
minor
ones
which
are
not
used
very
much,
insurrection
or
something
like
that.
but
--
in
these
cases,
i
think
almost
all
of
them
have
lesser
included
offenses.
here,
the
jury,
i
think
was
charged
with
or
4
or
5
lesser
included
non-capital
offenses.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
it's
up
to
the
judge
on
what
terms
of
years
would
be
imposed.
if
they
bring
in
recommendation
of
mercy
after
having
convicted
of
the
first
degree
offense
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
--
then
the
judge
is
bound
to
give
a
life
sentence.
in
all
other
cases,
the
judge
has
discretion
within
the
statutory
limit,
usually
it's
just
a
plain
old
common
law
felony
and
he
could
give
anything
from
any
amount
of
time
up
to
ten
years
in
the
state's
prison.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
afternoon,
at
closing
time
i
think
i
had
made
the
proposition
that
the
challenge
for
a
cause
should
be
limited
only
to
people
who
say
they
cannot
give
either
the
state
or
the
defendant
a
fair
trial.
that
only
those
people
should
be
kept
off
the
jury.
now
i'd
like
to
state
my
reasons
for
this
proposition.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
your
honor
that's
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
that
is
my
opinion
and
i
really
--
i
don't
attempt
to
make
the
question
any
broader
than
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
--
what
i've
just
stated.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
of
course,
that
issue,
i
suppose
could
be
reached
in
the
illinois
case
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
--
but
this
is
really,
i
think
a
--
were
confronted
of,
i
believe
here
with
the
collision
course
really
between
the
right
of
the
state
to
seek
the
death
penalty
and
what
we
contend
to
be
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
seek
a
fair
trial.
now
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
no,
sir.
there's
a
long
line
of
cases
in
north
carolina
and
beginning,
i
believe
about
1870
the
earliest
one
of
which
is
cited
in
petitioner's
brief
and
we're
concerned
only
with
the
common
law
disqualification.
a
really
common
law
is
not
the
right
word
either
because
i
contend
there
was
no
disqualification
of
the
common
law
but
it
is
a
court-made
rule
enforced
in
north
carolina.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
and
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
i
certainly
think
so.
the
first
point,
i
believe,
is
it
--
that
it's
numerically
significant.
now,
the
attorney
general
of
north
carolina
stipulated
or
conceded
in
the
case
of
crawford
v.
(inaudible)
that
30%
of
our
citizens
in
north
carolina
would
be
challengeable
for
a
cause
on
this
ground,
on
the
ground
of
conscientious
subjection
to
the
death
penalty.
i
presume
that
elsewhere
in
the
united
states,
the
statistics
are
pretty
much
the
same.
certainly
from
the
(inaudible)
post
and
the
other
indices
available
to
us
are
--
this
is
not
an
unreasonable
figure
keeping
in
mind
that
some
of
those
who
at
the
outset
say
they
are
opposed
which
is
something
like
half
of
our
population
may
as
the
study
cited
by
mr.
jenner
(ph)
yesterday
made
by
professor
zeisel
indicates,
these
people
when
really
put
to
the
test
of
a
heinous
or
atrocious
crime
might
back
down
and
be
willing
to
invoke
the
death
penalty.
but
i
think
that
30%
figure
is
a
fair
figure
for
north
carolina
since
it's
conceded
by
my
adversary.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
i
think
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
if
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
your
honor.
is
it
--
you
mean
if
a
prospective
juror
says
that
he
could
do
it
in
some
cases
but
not
in
all
cases
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
oh,
i
think
that
would
be
error.
and
although
i
haven't
researched
the
question,
my
often
opinion
would
be
that
the
state
could
have
the
error
reversed
by
the
supreme
court
although
appeals
by
the
state
are
very
nearly
limited
in
north
carolina
in
criminal
cases
not
--
without
researching
the
point,
i'd
hesitate
to
say.
but
if
he
recognize
this
error
whether
or
not
the
state
could
procure
a
reversal
is
something
i
noted
mr.
mcgalliard
could
answer
more
correctly
than
i
can.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir.
well
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
that's
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
that
second
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
the
second
question
is
not
asked
under
our
practice
and
it's
my
contention
that
that
second
question
is
the
vital
question
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
now
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
my
contention
is
that
the
vital
question
is
the
second
question
of
whether
or
not
in
spite
or
your
scruples
you
could
go
on
and
give
both
the
state
and
the
defendant
a
fair
trial
on
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence.
if
you
can
do
that
in
spite
of
your
scruples
we
contend
the
juror
should
be
ceded
and
no
challenge
for
cause
should
be
allowed
because
we
believe
that
the
right
of
a
fair
trail
attaches
on
this
primary
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
and
the
state's
right
to
seek
the
death
penalty
must
be
subordinated
to
that.
now
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
by
capital
verdict,
i
understood
mr.
justice
black
to
mean
a
verdict
of
guilty
without
recommendation
of
mercy.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
but
i'm
trying
to
distinguish
between
the
jury's
function
in
recommending
or
not
recommending
mercy.
that
is
determining
whether
or
not
there
will
be
like
imprisonment
and
its
function
of
adjudicating
guilt
or
innocence.
and
if
this
juror,
this
prospective
juror
said
that
he
could
give
the
state
and
the
defendant
a
fair
trial
on
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence,
in
spite
of
his
scruples
against
death
--
the
death
penalty,
then
he
should
be
ceded.
even
though
he
says
in
no
case
can
i
impose
the
death
penalty
and
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
been
demonstrated
that
in
many
instances,
a
juror
who
has
opposed
to
the
death
penalty
would
nevertheless
be
willing
to
vote
on
the
guilt
or
innocence
issue
where
the
--
with
a
free
and
impartial
mind
in
accordance
with
the
instructions
given
by
the
judge.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
then,
at
that
point,
your
honor,
a
second
question
must
be
asked
to
the
juror.
he
must
be
asked,
“in
spite
of
your
scruples
against
the
death
penalty,
can
you,
on
the
issue
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
that
he
could
not
give
the
state
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
your
honor,
i
still
think
that's
a
different
question
because
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir,
but
i
think
they
have
to
ask
them
another
question.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
it's
been
my
feeling
all
along
your
honor.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
it's
set
out
very
clearly
in
my
reply
brief,
your
honor.
the
entire
section
4
beginning
on
page
10
is
directed
to
that
exact
problem.
i
think
i
have
some
reasons
that
would
support
this
position
and
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
indeed,
that's
the
holding
in
the
case
of
crawford
v.
(inaudible)
so
it's
not
without
some
authority.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
oh,
i
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
the
jury
then,
i
assume
--
i've
been
in
a
jury
room
but
i
assume
they
find
him
guilty
or
innocent
first
and
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
--
assuming
they
find
him
guilt
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
--
guilty.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
then
they
go
on
and
consider
whether
they
will
recommend
mercy.
that's
the
language
we
used,
“recommend
mercy”
and
this
recommendation
is
binding
on
the
court.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
and
it
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
is
without
discretion
in
that
case
so
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
none.
he
must
sentence
to
life
imprisonment.
this
is
not
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
sir.
and
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
sir,
for
rape.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
now,
there
are
lesser
included
offenses
and
as
a
general
rule,
indeed
in
this
case,
the
judge
will
charge
with
lesser
included
offenses:
assault
on
a
female,
assault
on
battering,
so
forth
and
so
on.
and
these
instances,
of
course,
you
get
usually
the
ten-year
maximum
of
--
for
felony
imprisonment.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
and
they
stay
stuck
on
that.
you
mean
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
that
has
not
happened.
there
is
dictum
by
our
supreme
court
that
we
would
follow
the
ambrose
case
decided
by
this
court,
decided
in
the
briefs
here
requiring
unanimity
on
both
issues.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
a
mistrial.
and
there
are
other
alternatives
to
this
result
which
i
would
suggest
are
avenues
that
the
state
can
pursue
in
the
event
that
petitioner
is
awarded
the
relief
which
he
request.
i
think
for
instance
you
can
require
the
--
be
reversed
that
there'd
be
a
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir,
i
am.
i
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
i
would
suggest,
your
honor
that
he
would
still
feel
himself
free
to
join
with
the
other
jurors
and
find
the
defendant
guilty.
and
then
when
it
comes
to
the
penalty
phase
of
the
deliberations,
he
would
refuse
to
join
the
other
jurors
in
failing
to
recommend
mercy
and
he
would
come
back
in
and
possibly
hung
the
jury.
on
the
other
hand,
it's
possible
that
he
could
be
talked
out
of
this
position.
and
i
--
of
course,
if
the
mechanics
of
the
jury,
the
deliberation
process
are
still
i
suppose
quite
much
of
a
mystery,
i
don't
think
we
know
a
lot
about
it.
but
it
appears
from
the
results
in
cases
that
hung
jurors
are
relatively
few
when
it
--
it's
either
some
kind
of
a
compromise
that's
worked
out
such
as
a
lesser
included
offense
possibly
or
the
moral
persuasion
of
the
majority
and
finally
bends
the
will
of
the
minority
on
the
jury.
i
think
this
is
a
usual
thing.
it
happens
all
the
time.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir.
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
i
point
out
that
it's
a
large
group.
and
secondly,
i
tried
--
attempt
the
juxtapose
the
interest
of
the
state,
which
i
say
is
relatively
slight
in
it
that
for
few
executions
are
ever
carried
out
and
this
interest
of
the
state
is
a
very,
very
small
one.
they
only
executed
one
person
say
in
1966
in
a
handful
in
the
few
years
proceedings.
and
so
we
rely
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir.
we
rely
on
this
studies,
i
crossed
on
wilson,
goldberg
and
zeisel
coincidentally
which
are
to
some
extent
in
the
public
domain,
i
realized
that
was
questioned
yesterday
but
they
have
been
cited
on
the
basis
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
but
the
very
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
i
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
think
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
our
claim,
it's
an
equal
protection
violation
and
a
due
process
violation
and
a
deprivation
of
the
impartial
jury
right.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
and
the
important
thing
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
your
honor.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i'm
going
to
move
on
if
i
may
only
say
one
more
thing.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
the
important
thing
about
these
studies
is
the
--
you
don't
have
to
accept
or
to
prove
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir.
we
claim
three
things,
your
honor:
the
sixth
amendment,
which
is
applicable
to
the
states
and
in
accordance
with
this
court's
decision
in
parker
versus
gladden
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause;
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
because
the
fact-finding
process
itself,
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process
is
impugned.
and
we
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
by
the
exclusion
of
jurors
who
are
likely,
who
are
less
likely
to
be
prosecution
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
it's
a
very
related
question,
your
honor,
but
it's
an
exclusion
of
a
class
of
jurors
which
is
injurious
to
the
defendant.
i
think
the
important
thing
in
it
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
i
think
it
does.
i
think
these
are
related
arguments.
i
think
that's
what
the
fourth
circuit
ultimately
determined.
i
guess
i
better
talk
about
the
search
and
seizure
for
in
the
moment.
the
defendant
was
arrested
on
the
day
after
the
search.
i
made
a
misstatement
of
that
fact
in
the
brief.
i
said
the
--
vice-versa
but
the
search
was
before
the
arrest.
the
defendant
lives
with
his
grandmother
who
was
a
66
years
old
negro
widow
who
lived
at
the
end
of
a
one
mile
dirt
road
in
the
rural
section
of
alamance
county,
north
carolina.
i've
been
down
that
road
and
it's
quite
generous
to
call
it
a
road
because
it's
a
pretty
rough
track.
the
point
i
suppose,
is
it
is
an
isolated
place
and
at
the
time
the
officers
came,
four
of
them
and
four
sheriffs
in
a
sheriff's
car,
all
white,
the
grandmother
was
--
at
the
house
along
with
some
of
her
infant
grandchildren
not
including
the
defendant
who
was
18
but
some
younger
children
and
her
adult
son
was
away
from
the
house.
these
officers
came
up
to
the
door.
this
woman
is
elderly
and
i
think
that
if
--
from
reading
the
record,
you
can
indicate
--
the
record
indicates
she's
deficient
in
education.
and
the
officers
pulled
out
some
kind
of
a
paper
and
presented
it
to
her
instead
they
had
a
warrant
or
a
notice
or
something.
she
called
it
a
warrant
on
one
occasion,
notice
on
the
other
for
searching
her
premises.
they
didn't
explain
why
they
were
searching
or
on
what
connection
and
she
acquiescently
opened
the
door
and
stepped
aside
and
said,
“alright,
come
in,
you
may
search”
and
they
did.
and
they
looked
around
in
the
house
and
found
in
the
kitchen,
which
was
a
common
room
of
the
house,
a
rifle,
which
was
a
common
article
of
the
household.
i
suggest
owned
and
possessed
among
all
the
individuals
in
the
household
including
the
defendant.
this
rifle
was
seized
and
taken
and
it
later
became
material
evidence
in
the
case.
they
also
stripped
some
of
the
clothing
of
one
of
the
14
year
old
grandson
who
was
present.
his
clothing,
however,
was
later
returned
and
not
used
in
the
trial.
incidentally,
it
didn't
match
the
kind
of
clothing
that
the
defendant
supposedly
wore
on
the
occasion
in
question
anyway.
this
matter
was
brought
up
to
trial
by
a
motion
to
suppress
and
i
tendered
an
affidavit
by
the
grandmother
explaining
these
things
which
i
have
just
set
out,
this
one.
and
then
attended
to
her
as
a
witness
and
she
was
cross-examined
by
the
solicitor
and
in
--
on
a
redirect
and
i
supposed,
would
say
i
examined
her
again
and
she
testified
to
me
the
essential
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
no,
sir.
the
piece
of
paper
is
nowhere
in
the
record
and
what
the
solicitor
did,
and
it
could
be
found
on
page
43
of
the
appendix
of
the
--
the
solicitor
said
to
the
judge
--
i
see
my
time
is
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
solicitor
said
that
the
court
of
the
state
is
not
relying
on
the
search
warrant
and
the
court
said,
“are
you
so
stating
for
the
record”
and
the
solicitor
said,
“yes,
sir”.
and
then
i
said,
“then
we're
concerned
only
with
consent”
and
the
court
indicated
we
were.
so
the
warrant
was
never
introduced,
not
part
of
the
record.
and
the
solicitor
never
at
any
time
relied
on
it.
yet,
i
contend
that
the
officers
relied
on
it
at
the
time
they
made
the
search.
this
woman
thought
she
was
yielding
to
a
search
by
warrant,
an
official
warrant,
brought
by
officers
of
the
law.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
the
court
found
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
that
there
was
voluntary
consent
to
the
search
and
it
was
upheld
by
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir,
i
certainly
do.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
i
don't
raise
that
point,
your
honor.
i'm
inclined
to
think
that
she
could.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
and
the
children,
of
course,
live
in
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
and
the
children
of
course
used
the
rifle
and
lived
in
the
home.
they
went
out
hunting
rabbits
with
it
and
shooting
to
scare
off
the
mule
and
things
like
that
which
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
don't
think
it's
a
sound
--
that
my
personal
opinion
is
that
it's
not
a
sound
point.
i
say
unquestionably
there
is
standing
for
the
petitioner
to
raise
the
issue.
but
i
do
think
that
the
woman
had
the
right
to
consent
since
it
was
her
house.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
i
argued
that
in
the
brief
and
i
say
that
is
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
sir?
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
sir,
it
was
never
introduced.
i'm
going
beyond
the
record
now
to
say
that
there
was
a
paper
writing
which
purported
to
be
a
warrant.
i
don't
know.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
issued
by
a
magistrate.
and
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
valid
or
not.
i
argued
--
i
submitted
a
brief
attacking
its
validity.
and
apparently,
the
solicitor
felt
that
it
wasn't
any
good
because
he
didn't
use
it
at
the
trial.
he
quit
it
and
went
off
on
consent.
i
suppose
if
he
had
any
faith
in
his
warrant,
he
would've
presented
it
to
the
trial
court,
it
would
be
a
part
of
the
record
but
it's
not.
and
i'm
going
beyond
the
record
to
say
this
but
those
are
the
facts
as
i
find
the
case
and
i
know.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
think
semi
illiterate,
your
honor,
although
again
unfortunately,
that
doesn't
appear
from
the
record.
i
can
say
that
that
reading,
the
dialogue,
reading
the
testimony
would
indicate
that
she
was
not
an
educated
person.
she
clearly
didn't
have
any
conception
of
constitutional
law
or
political
science
or
matters
of
that
nature.
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court
that
mapp
versus
ohio
is
being
evaded
and
detoured
perhaps
by
the
excessive
use
of
this
device
of
the
consensual
search.
and
if
the
exclusionary
rule
which
this
court
put
--
lay
down
in
mapp
is
to
be
preserved
that
the
case
is
such
as
amos
and
johnson
versus
united
states
must
be
declared
fourteenth
amendment
law,
a
fourteenth
amendment
law
and
made
applicable
to
the
states.
taking
a
phrase
from
the
case
of
johnson
v.
united
states
granted
in
submission
to
authority
rather
than
as
an
understanding
in
the
intentional
waiver
of
the
constitutional
right.
clearly,
i
think
you
--
epitomizes
the
behavior
of
the
woman
under
these
circumstances.
and
i
don't
think
her
testimony,
which
is
somewhat
confused
and
earning
a
heat
of
the
courtroom
proceedings
and
under
a
rather
stiff
cross-examination.
it
was
a
crowded
courtroom
of
a
controversial
case.
it
takes
a
lot
of
pressure.
i
don't
think
that
this
can
be
deemed
conclusive.
so
for
these
reasons,
the
petitioner
respectfully
prays
that
the
court
to
set
aside
the
conviction
of
the
petitioner
and
order
that
he
be
granted
a
new
trial.
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
i
thank
the
court
for
hearing
the
case.
