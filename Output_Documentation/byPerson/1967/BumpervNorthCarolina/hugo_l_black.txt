justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
it
all,
the
question
which
has
been
mainly
argued
in
the
illinois
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
talking
about
the
part
that
it's
argued
that
they
should
have
known
further
and
asked
him
further
questions
to
bring
out
clearly
that
he
was
not
under
any
circumstances
on
the
death
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
gets
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
asked?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
have
to
--
have
that
question
then
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
reaching
the
question
of
whether
that
court
--
a
state
has
a
death
sentence
it's
unconstitutional
to
qualify
the
juror
in
connection
with
their
belief
that
they
are
against
the
death
sentence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
to
be
answering
--
is
it
clear
but
your
--
does
the
north
carolina
have
a
death
sentence
imposed?
does
it
authorize
the
death
sentence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
crimes
like
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
you're
insisting,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
it
is
a
constitutional
error
for
people
to
be
taken
off
the
jury
because
they
tell
the
jury
the
--
under
no
circumstances,
would
convict
and
impose
the
death
sentence.
is
that
your
position?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
question
that
you
brought
to
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
that's
what
i
mean.
i
did
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
thought
you've
said
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
your
point,
yeah?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
meant
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
that.
do
you
say,
“even
though
he
said
there's
no
case
would
he
impose
a
death
penalty”?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
take
up
the
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
i
had
it
before.
let's
take
a
juror.
he
comes
in.
they
asked
him
if
he
has
scruples
against
the
death
penalty,
he
says,
“yes”.
the
judge
has
a
long
colloquy
with
you
in
which
he
insists
that
he
is
qualified
because
he
believes
he
might
impose
a
death
penalty.
the
juror
continuous
to
say,
“i
would
not".
what
do
you
say
about
excusing
him
as
a
matter
of
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright,
i
was
giving
you
one
why
he'd
ask
him
that?
why
he
has
to
ask
him
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
would
not,
could
not
and
would
not
impose
the
death
penalty
under
any
circumstance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
not
what
you
have
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
but
did
you
think
that
when
you
prepared
your
certiorari
up
here
or
did
you
cons
--
determined
that
yesterday
after
you
heard
this
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
is
it
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
he
said,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
absolutely
what
she
said,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
didn't
--
they
didn't
have
to
have
a
search
warrant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
--
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
she
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
she
say
on
the
stand?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
is
that
document
a
search
warrant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
but
it's
been
talked
about
here
and
filed
on
the
notes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
indication
that
they
went
there
without
a
search
warrant
and
deceived
her
and
that's
--
to
believing
that
they
did
have
warrant.
