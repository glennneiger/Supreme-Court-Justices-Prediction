mr.
david
freeman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
of
the
third
circuit
affirming
the
order
of
the
district
court
of
pennsylvania
dismissing
the
appellant?s
complaint.
the
appellant
was
the
plaintiff
in
the
case.
he
was
a
resident
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
a
shareholder
in
the
defendant
corporation.
he
filed
a
complaint
seeking
to
have
the
court
grant
an
order
permitting
him
to
examine
the
books
of
the
defendant
corporation.
this
is
a
right
given
by
the
statutes
of
pennsylvania
under
which
the
defendant
corporation
was
incorporated.
the
defendant
filed
an
answer
or
the
merits
denying
the
good
faith
of
the
plaintiff,
the
appellant
here.
also,
denying
that
the
court
had
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter.
subsequently,
just
before
the
case
came
to
trial
about
three
years
later,
the
defendant
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
in
which
it
said
that
the
district
court
had
no
power
to
grant
the
type
of
order
prayed
for.
that
is
an
order
in
the
nature
of
a
mandamus.
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
contention
of
the
defendant,
dismissed
the
complaint.
we
appealed
to
the
circuit
court
which
also
agreed
with
the
contention
of
the
defendant.
judge
smith
wrote
the
opinion.
it
was
concurred
in
by
judge
freedman
and
judge
ganey
wrote
a
dissenting
opinion.
this
appeal
then
followed.
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
a
stockholder
is
given
the
right
to
examine
the
books
of
the
corporation
at
reasonable
times
and
for
reasonable
purposes.
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania
then
go
on
to
say
that
this
right
to
examine
the
books
may
be
enforced
by
what
is
called
a
writ
of
mandamus.
though
i
surmise
that
if
the
statutes
had
not
said
so,
that
the
courts
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
would
probably
have
found
some
other
method
of
enforcing
this
writ
either
by
way
of
an
equity
proceeding
or
by
conforming
some
common
law
writ
of
the
state.
now,
the
courts
further
have
held,
that
is
the
courts
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
that
the
courts
of
equity
in
that
state
can
not
enforce
this
right
because
there
is
a
remedy
at
law.
but
the
courts
inequity
will
enforce
the
right
if
some
other
relief
is
called
for
or
is
asked
for.
this
case
we
asked
for
no
other
relief.
we
asked
merely
to
examine
the
books.
the
district
court
and
circuit
court
said,
well
the
state
of
pennsylvania
calls
this
a
writ
of
mandamus,
you
are
asking
for
an
order
in
the
nature
of
a
writ
of
mandamus,
we
have
no
right
to
grant
this.
and
this
position
arises
in
the
following
manner.
the
district
courts
being
courts
of
inferior
jurisdiction,
of
course
had
only
the
power
granted,
or
rather
the
jurisdiction
granted
to
them
by
congress.
now,
congress
in
the
original
--
under
the
original
judiciary
acts
and
subsequently,
has
granted
the
district
court?s
jurisdiction
in
civil
matters.
in
the
first
cases
which
arose
on
this
subject,
case
of
mcintire-wood
--
of
the
mcintire
and
wood
mcclung
versus
sullivan,
decided
that
the
--
under
this
statute
the
district
courts
had
no
right
to
grant
a
writ
of
mandamus.
in
those
cases
what
was
prayed
for
was
an
order
against
a
land
registrar
to
register
a
deed.
a
land
registrar
was
an
executive
officer
of
the
federal
government.
the
courts
or
rather
the
supreme
court
in
those
cases
said,
we
are
given
civil?
--
or
rather
?the
district
court
is
given
civil
jurisdiction."
this
is
a
writ
against
an
executive
officer.
this
is
not
civil
jurisdiction.
so
the
point
in
those
early
cases
was
not
that
the
district
courts
did
not
have
a
right
to
issue
a
mandatory
order.
the
point
was
that
the
district
courts
did
not
have
a
right
to
issue
an
order
against
an
executive
officer
of
the
federal
government,
because
it
was
considered
that
this
was
in
the
nature
of
the
old
prerogative
writ
of
mandamus
and
was
not
the
jurisdiction
which
congress
wished
to
confer
upon
the
district
courts
of
the
united
states.
now,
these
cases
were
followed
by
cases
which
dealt
with
the
enforcement
of
the
payments
of
debts
by
the
states.
a
case
such
as
rosenbaum
and
bauer
i
mentioned
in
my
brief
dealt
with
the
question
of
forcing
the
state
officer
to
pay
bonds.
and
the
usual
manner
in
which
the
state
and
municipal
debts
are
collected
is
by
a
writ
of
mandamus
in
the
states
against
those
particular
officers.
and
the
courts
have
held
that
in
diversity
cases,
the
federal
courts
have
no
right
to
issue
this
type
of
order
against
the
state
officers
again
on
the
ground
that
this
is
in
the
nature
of
the
old
prerogative
writ.
this
concerns
the
interference
of
the
judiciary
with
the
executive
branches.
it
concerns
the
problem
of
the
federal
government
versus
the
state
government,
and
for
these
reasons,
it
was
felt
that
the
congress
never
intended
the
district
courts
to
have
power
to
interfere
in
these
very
delicate
matters.
the
next
case
decided
on
this
subject
by
the
supreme
court
was
the
knapp
case.
the
knapp
case
dealt
with
the
construction
of
certain
features
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
question
on
that
case
was
whether
a
writ
of
mandamus
could
be
granted
requiring
the
railroad
to
publish
a
tariff.
the
court
in
that
case
said
that,
we
weren't
given
this
right
that
is
the
district
court
is
not
given
this
right
by
the
act
and
besides
there
are
equitable
revenues
under
the
act
by
which
the
saying
resell
could
be
reached.
i?m
not
quite
certain
why
that
was
so
important
in
those
days,
why
it
was
so
important
for
the
federal
court
to
say
that
we
can
do
this
by
way
of
equity
and
we
cannot
do
it
by
way
of
mandamus.
and
i
suppose
it
is
because
they
thought
in
terms
of
causes
of
action
rather
than
in
terms
of
rights
and
remedies
as
we
do
today.
nevertheless,
that
case,
i
think,
is
one
which
does
not
deal
with
ordinary
civil
litigation
and
does
not
come
within
the
meaning
of
the
word
civil
jurisdiction.
these
are
the
cases
which
the
supreme
court
has
decided.
in
the
lower
courts,
there
are
--
there
have
recently
been,
since
the
1960s
a
few
cases
at
which
the
lower
courts
have
said,
we
are
bound
by
the
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
which
stated
that
we
have
no
power
to
issue
a
writ
of
mandamus.
these
cases
are
very
often
dealt
with
cases
of
officials
either
of
the
state
or
of
the
federal
government.
and
those
cases
i
think
also
do
not
come
within
the
terms
civil
jurisdiction.
however,
there
were
a
few
cases
in
the
lower
court
where
they
decided
that
they
didn't
have
the
right
to
issue
a
writ
of
mandamus
in
a
case
where
an
ordinary
mandatory
order
in
civil
litigation
was
prayed
for.
cases
similar
to
this
one,
cases
in
which
a
stockholder
wanted
to
examine
the
books
of
a
corporation.
it
is
our
position
that
merely
because
the
state
of
pennsylvania
enforces
this
right
by
what
it
terms
a
writ
of
mandamus,
and
merely
because
the
same
word
mandamus
is
applied
to
different
things
that
the
right
of
the
district
court
to
issue
that
type
of
order
is
not
limited
--
that
was
never
intended
to
be
limited
by
congress.
if
you
state
the
proposition
in
this
way,
if
you
say,
congress
never
intended
the
district
courts
to
have
the
power
to
issue
a
mandatory
order
in
private
civil
litigation
where
it
is
requested
by
one
individual
against
another,
i
think
the
question
answers
itself,
because
the
mere
statement
of
that
question
which
shows
that
the
courts
would
be
so
inhibited
in
granting
relief
under
modern
conditions
that
is
impossible
for
congress
ever
to
have
desired
such
an
end.
it
is
our
position
that
the
district
courts
do
not
have
a
right
generally
to
issue
mandatory
orders
against
public
or
state
officials
except
as
modified
by
a
recent
act
in
1962,
but
that
they
do
have
the
right
to
issue
orders
against
individuals
to
enforce
purely
private
rights
and
private
litigation.
now,
the
dissenting
judge
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
approached
the
problem
in
a
slightly
different
manner.
he
said
or
he
inferred
that
under
the
present
rules,
there
are
no
--
there
is
no
differentiation
between
actions
at
law
in
equity,
we
only
have
civil
actions.
and
if
a
mandatory
order
is
asked
for,
who
is
to
say
whether
it's
asked
for
at
law
or
whether
it?s
asked
for
in
equity.
the
mere
fact
that
the
state
says
that
you
do
it
by
an
action
and
mandamus
at
law
doesn't
bind
us
here.
we
have
a
right
under
the
doctrine
of
the
york
case
and
under
the
general
doctrines
of
the
federal
courts
to
make
up
our
own
enforcement
laws
unless
they
are
specifically
prohibited
to
us.
there
certainly
is
nothing
in
the
statutes
which
inhibits
the
district
court
from
making
a
mandatory
order.
the
statutes
merely
say
that
the
district
courts
shall
have
civil
jurisdiction.
everything
else
with
regard
to
mandatory
orders
and
private
litigation
is
substantive
which
has
been
added
only
by
the
lower
courts
under,
i
believe
the
mistaken
impression
that
the
word
mandamus
so
taints
a
mandatory
order
of
any
kind
that
the
lower
courts,
district
courts
have
no
right
to
grant
that
writ.
mr.
david
freeman
well
that's
a
rather
delicate
subject
sir.
i
did
not
go
into
the
state
courts
because
i
felt
that
the
adversary
was
so
powerful
that
i
would
not
--
i
would
perhaps
not
get
my
problem
today
in
court.
that
was
the
only
reason
that
i
did
not
go
into
the
state
courts.
may
i
reserve
some
of
my
time
for
rebuttal?
mr.
david
freeman
i
have
no
reply
sir.
mr.
david
freeman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
of
the
third
circuit
affirming
the
order
of
the
district
court
of
pennsylvania
dismissing
the
appellant?s
complaint.
the
appellant
was
the
plaintiff
in
the
case.
he
was
a
resident
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
a
shareholder
in
the
defendant
corporation.
he
filed
a
complaint
seeking
to
have
the
court
grant
an
order
permitting
him
to
examine
the
books
of
the
defendant
corporation.
this
is
a
right
given
by
the
statutes
of
pennsylvania
under
which
the
defendant
corporation
was
incorporated.
the
defendant
filed
an
answer
or
the
merits
denying
the
good
faith
of
the
plaintiff,
the
appellant
here.
also,
denying
that
the
court
had
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter.
subsequently,
just
before
the
case
came
to
trial
about
three
years
later,
the
defendant
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
in
which
it
said
that
the
district
court
had
no
power
to
grant
the
type
of
order
prayed
for.
that
is
an
order
in
the
nature
of
a
mandamus.
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
contention
of
the
defendant,
dismissed
the
complaint.
we
appealed
to
the
circuit
court
which
also
agreed
with
the
contention
of
the
defendant.
judge
smith
wrote
the
opinion.
it
was
concurred
in
by
judge
freedman
and
judge
ganey
wrote
a
dissenting
opinion.
this
appeal
then
followed.
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
a
stockholder
is
given
the
right
to
examine
the
books
of
the
corporation
at
reasonable
times
and
for
reasonable
purposes.
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania
then
go
on
to
say
that
this
right
to
examine
the
books
may
be
enforced
by
what
is
called
a
writ
of
mandamus.
though
i
surmise
that
if
the
statutes
had
not
said
so,
that
the
courts
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
would
probably
have
found
some
other
method
of
enforcing
this
writ
either
by
way
of
an
equity
proceeding
or
by
conforming
some
common
law
writ
of
the
state.
now,
the
courts
further
have
held,
that
is
the
courts
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
that
the
courts
of
equity
in
that
state
can
not
enforce
this
right
because
there
is
a
remedy
at
law.
but
the
courts
inequity
will
enforce
the
right
if
some
other
relief
is
called
for
or
is
asked
for.
this
case
we
asked
for
no
other
relief.
we
asked
merely
to
examine
the
books.
the
district
court
and
circuit
court
said,
well
the
state
of
pennsylvania
calls
this
a
writ
of
mandamus,
you
are
asking
for
an
order
in
the
nature
of
a
writ
of
mandamus,
we
have
no
right
to
grant
this.
and
this
position
arises
in
the
following
manner.
the
district
courts
being
courts
of
inferior
jurisdiction,
of
course
had
only
the
power
granted,
or
rather
the
jurisdiction
granted
to
them
by
congress.
now,
congress
in
the
original
--
under
the
original
judiciary
acts
and
subsequently,
has
granted
the
district
court?s
jurisdiction
in
civil
matters.
in
the
first
cases
which
arose
on
this
subject,
case
of
mcintire-wood
--
of
the
mcintire
and
wood
mcclung
versus
sullivan,
decided
that
the
--
under
this
statute
the
district
courts
had
no
right
to
grant
a
writ
of
mandamus.
in
those
cases
what
was
prayed
for
was
an
order
against
a
land
registrar
to
register
a
deed.
a
land
registrar
was
an
executive
officer
of
the
federal
government.
the
courts
or
rather
the
supreme
court
in
those
cases
said,
we
are
given
civil?
--
or
rather
?the
district
court
is
given
civil
jurisdiction."
this
is
a
writ
against
an
executive
officer.
this
is
not
civil
jurisdiction.
so
the
point
in
those
early
cases
was
not
that
the
district
courts
did
not
have
a
right
to
issue
a
mandatory
order.
the
point
was
that
the
district
courts
did
not
have
a
right
to
issue
an
order
against
an
executive
officer
of
the
federal
government,
because
it
was
considered
that
this
was
in
the
nature
of
the
old
prerogative
writ
of
mandamus
and
was
not
the
jurisdiction
which
congress
wished
to
confer
upon
the
district
courts
of
the
united
states.
now,
these
cases
were
followed
by
cases
which
dealt
with
the
enforcement
of
the
payments
of
debts
by
the
states.
a
case
such
as
rosenbaum
and
bauer
i
mentioned
in
my
brief
dealt
with
the
question
of
forcing
the
state
officer
to
pay
bonds.
and
the
usual
manner
in
which
the
state
and
municipal
debts
are
collected
is
by
a
writ
of
mandamus
in
the
states
against
those
particular
officers.
and
the
courts
have
held
that
in
diversity
cases,
the
federal
courts
have
no
right
to
issue
this
type
of
order
against
the
state
officers
again
on
the
ground
that
this
is
in
the
nature
of
the
old
prerogative
writ.
this
concerns
the
interference
of
the
judiciary
with
the
executive
branches.
it
concerns
the
problem
of
the
federal
government
versus
the
state
government,
and
for
these
reasons,
it
was
felt
that
the
congress
never
intended
the
district
courts
to
have
power
to
interfere
in
these
very
delicate
matters.
the
next
case
decided
on
this
subject
by
the
supreme
court
was
the
knapp
case.
the
knapp
case
dealt
with
the
construction
of
certain
features
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
question
on
that
case
was
whether
a
writ
of
mandamus
could
be
granted
requiring
the
railroad
to
publish
a
tariff.
the
court
in
that
case
said
that,
we
weren't
given
this
right
that
is
the
district
court
is
not
given
this
right
by
the
act
and
besides
there
are
equitable
revenues
under
the
act
by
which
the
saying
resell
could
be
reached.
i?m
not
quite
certain
why
that
was
so
important
in
those
days,
why
it
was
so
important
for
the
federal
court
to
say
that
we
can
do
this
by
way
of
equity
and
we
cannot
do
it
by
way
of
mandamus.
and
i
suppose
it
is
because
they
thought
in
terms
of
causes
of
action
rather
than
in
terms
of
rights
and
remedies
as
we
do
today.
nevertheless,
that
case,
i
think,
is
one
which
does
not
deal
with
ordinary
civil
litigation
and
does
not
come
within
the
meaning
of
the
word
civil
jurisdiction.
these
are
the
cases
which
the
supreme
court
has
decided.
in
the
lower
courts,
there
are
--
there
have
recently
been,
since
the
1960s
a
few
cases
at
which
the
lower
courts
have
said,
we
are
bound
by
the
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
which
stated
that
we
have
no
power
to
issue
a
writ
of
mandamus.
these
cases
are
very
often
dealt
with
cases
of
officials
either
of
the
state
or
of
the
federal
government.
and
those
cases
i
think
also
do
not
come
within
the
terms
civil
jurisdiction.
however,
there
were
a
few
cases
in
the
lower
court
where
they
decided
that
they
didn't
have
the
right
to
issue
a
writ
of
mandamus
in
a
case
where
an
ordinary
mandatory
order
in
civil
litigation
was
prayed
for.
cases
similar
to
this
one,
cases
in
which
a
stockholder
wanted
to
examine
the
books
of
a
corporation.
it
is
our
position
that
merely
because
the
state
of
pennsylvania
enforces
this
right
by
what
it
terms
a
writ
of
mandamus,
and
merely
because
the
same
word
mandamus
is
applied
to
different
things
that
the
right
of
the
district
court
to
issue
that
type
of
order
is
not
limited
--
that
was
never
intended
to
be
limited
by
congress.
if
you
state
the
proposition
in
this
way,
if
you
say,
congress
never
intended
the
district
courts
to
have
the
power
to
issue
a
mandatory
order
in
private
civil
litigation
where
it
is
requested
by
one
individual
against
another,
i
think
the
question
answers
itself,
because
the
mere
statement
of
that
question
which
shows
that
the
courts
would
be
so
inhibited
in
granting
relief
under
modern
conditions
that
is
impossible
for
congress
ever
to
have
desired
such
an
end.
it
is
our
position
that
the
district
courts
do
not
have
a
right
generally
to
issue
mandatory
orders
against
public
or
state
officials
except
as
modified
by
a
recent
act
in
1962,
but
that
they
do
have
the
right
to
issue
orders
against
individuals
to
enforce
purely
private
rights
and
private
litigation.
now,
the
dissenting
judge
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
approached
the
problem
in
a
slightly
different
manner.
he
said
or
he
inferred
that
under
the
present
rules,
there
are
no
--
there
is
no
differentiation
between
actions
at
law
in
equity,
we
only
have
civil
actions.
and
if
a
mandatory
order
is
asked
for,
who
is
to
say
whether
it's
asked
for
at
law
or
whether
it?s
asked
for
in
equity.
the
mere
fact
that
the
state
says
that
you
do
it
by
an
action
and
mandamus
at
law
doesn't
bind
us
here.
we
have
a
right
under
the
doctrine
of
the
york
case
and
under
the
general
doctrines
of
the
federal
courts
to
make
up
our
own
enforcement
laws
unless
they
are
specifically
prohibited
to
us.
there
certainly
is
nothing
in
the
statutes
which
inhibits
the
district
court
from
making
a
mandatory
order.
the
statutes
merely
say
that
the
district
courts
shall
have
civil
jurisdiction.
everything
else
with
regard
to
mandatory
orders
and
private
litigation
is
substantive
which
has
been
added
only
by
the
lower
courts
under,
i
believe
the
mistaken
impression
that
the
word
mandamus
so
taints
a
mandatory
order
of
any
kind
that
the
lower
courts,
district
courts
have
no
right
to
grant
that
writ.
mr.
david
freeman
well
that's
a
rather
delicate
subject
sir.
i
did
not
go
into
the
state
courts
because
i
felt
that
the
adversary
was
so
powerful
that
i
would
not
--
i
would
perhaps
not
get
my
problem
today
in
court.
that
was
the
only
reason
that
i
did
not
go
into
the
state
courts.
may
i
reserve
some
of
my
time
for
rebuttal?
mr.
david
freeman
i
have
no
reply
sir.
