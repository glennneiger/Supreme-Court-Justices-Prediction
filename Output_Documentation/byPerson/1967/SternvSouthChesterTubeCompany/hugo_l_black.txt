justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
didn't
ask
for
a
mandamus
or
an
order.
he
just
asked
to
have
it
litigated.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
why?
why
should
the
law
be
so
foolish
as
to
let
the
federal
court
have
jurisdiction
to
try
the
issue
and
deny
jurisdiction
to
enforce
its
judgment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
way
most
bad
rules
determine
to
the
law,
isn't
it,
historically?
