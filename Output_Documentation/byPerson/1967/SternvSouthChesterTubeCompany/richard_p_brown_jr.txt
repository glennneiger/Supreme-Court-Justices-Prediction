mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
while
it
is
true
that
the
narrow
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
a
federal
district
court
has
jurisdiction
to
issue
a
mandatory
order
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
where
that
is
the
only
relief
requested.
there
is
a
much
more
fundamental
issue
which
is
presented
by
this
case.
and
that
is
whether
an
individual
state
by
conferring
a
certain
right
and
a
certain
remedy
upon
a
plaintiff
which
remedy
is
enforceable
in
the
in
the
state
courts
can
thereby
expand
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
in
a
diversity
case
so
as
to
grant
the
same
remedy
to
that
plaintiff
in
spite
of
the
jurisdictional
limitations
contained
in
the
acts
of
congress
with
respect
to
the
federal
court.
i
think
it's
clear
in
this
case
that
the
relief
requested
by
the
plaintiff
is
in
the
nature
of
mandamus.
that
is,
it
is
a
mandatory
order
directed
to
a
corporation
to
disclose
certain
records
which
the
plaintiff
wishes
to
see,
and
i
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor,
because
in
the
case
of
smith
against
bourbon
county
in
this
court,
it
was
said
that
this
remedy
is
a
--
the
objection
to
the
granting
of
this
remedy
is
a
substantive
one
and
that
it
cannot
be
cured
by
converting
the
action
into
an
equitable
action
or
by
calling
it
by
any
other
name.
if
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
mandamus,
that
is
a
mandatory
order
directed
to
someone
to
carry
out
an
act,
it
is
subject
to
the
jurisdictional
objection.
i
think
it
is
important
for
us
in
this
connection
to
examine
the
language
of
the
act
which
is
being
considered
here.
the
old
writs
act
which
is
found
in
section
1651
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
code.
that
language
says
that,
the
supreme
court
and
all
courts
established
by
acts
of
congress
may
issue
all
writs
necessary
or
appropriate
in
aid
of
their
respective
jurisdictions.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
don't
think
i
meant
to
say
that
your
honor,
but
i
did.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
what
i
intended
to
say
was
that
in
the
case
of
smith
versus
bourbon
county
the
court's
words
were,
this
court
would
be
without
jurisdiction
and
certainly
that
lack
of
jurisdiction
cannot
be
supplied
by
converting
the
proceeding
into
a
bill
in
equity.
the
objection
is
one
of
substance
and
not
merely
of
form.
it
cannot
be
waived
and
it
can
not
be
ignored.
and
i
believe
that
in
answer
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
harlan
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
yes,
well
i
submit
that
any
action
in
which
the
relief
requested
is
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
whether
it
is
called
an
equitable
action
or
a
mandatory
injunction
action.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
--
it's
the
substantive
nature
of
the
relief
requested,
that's
correct.
a
mandatory
order
in
which
there
is
no
other
jurisdictional
aspect
such
as
lack
of
adequate
remedy
at
law.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
well,
my
understanding
of
the
original
meaning
of
mandamus
is
that
it
was
an
order
by
the
court
directed
to
a
lower
court
to
a
judicial
officer,
to
a
federal
officer,
to
a
state
officer
or
to
a
corporate
officer
to
do
an
act.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
think,
if
the
court
please,
if
that
order
is
the
result
of
a
federal
arbitration
act
for
example
it
is
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
--
it?s
true,
it's
a
mandatory
order.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
yes,
i
think
it
is
a
mandatory
order
but
if
it
is
granted
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
--
if
it
is
granted
in
aid
of
the
court's
jurisdiction
otherwise
acquired,
the
court
has
the
power
to
issue
it.
if
there
is
no
other
ground
for
federal
jurisdiction
or
if
the
relief
requested
is
not
in
aid
of
that
jurisdiction,
the
mandatory
which
is
requested,
if
that
is
the
only
relief
sought
is
without
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
that
sounds
to
me
like
an
ordinary
equitable
action
in
which
the
relief
sought
is
mandatory
injunction,
and
if
there
is
an
inadequate
remedy
at
law
and
if
the
court
feels
that
it
is
necessary
to
issue
that
order
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction,
the
court
would
have
power
to
issue.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
think
the
federal
courts
have
equitable
jurisdiction
where
there
is
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
and
where
there's
an
inadequate
remedy
at
law.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
if
there
were
an
adequate
remedy
at
law
and
if
there
were
merely
diversity
and
jurisdictional
amount
involved
and
the
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
think
that
if
the
court
has
equitable
jurisdiction
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
if
the
court
has
equitable
jurisdiction,
your
honor,
and
if
it
feels
that
in
order
to
enforce
that
jurisdiction
it
needs
to
issue
the
mandatory
order,
it
has
jurisdiction
to
issue.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
there
is
clearly
an
adequate
remedy
at
law
in
the
state
court.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
an
action
which
is
denominated
in
the
state
court,
mandamus.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
there
are
certain
records
of
this
corporation
which
this
plaintiff
has
requested
which
we
have
declined
to
disclose
to
him.
they
are
records
relating
to
the
earnings
of
wholly
owned
subsidiaries
of
this
corporation.
and
we
have
declined
on
the
grounds
of
the
lack
of
good
faith
of
this
plaintiff,
but
i
think
that
would
be
an
issue
on
the
merits
which
would
be
decided
in
the
state
court
applying
the
rules
of
law
applicable
to
corporations
of
that
state.
and
if
the
plaintiff
made
out
a
proper
case,
the
state
court
would
grant
him
that
relief
and
there
is
no
suggestion
that
i
know
of
that
the
federal
court
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
as
we
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
say
that
where
there
is
no
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
in
this
situation,
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
--
there
is
an
adequate
remedy
at
law
available
to
the
plaintiff
in
the
state
court
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
think
your
honor
the
jurisdiction
is
limited
in
by
section
1332.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
if
there's
an
adequate
remedy
at
law,
the
court
does
not
have
equitable
jurisdiction.
if
it
is
not
a
civil
action
the
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
no.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i'm
not
contending
for
that.
i'm
suggesting
that
if
the
federal
court
has
jurisdiction
to
grant
equitable
relief,
it
can
issue
a
mandatory
order
in
order
of
that
injunction
--
that
jurisdiction.
but
where
the
only
remedy
sought
is
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
with
no
equitable
considerations
involved,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
does
not
lie.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
yes.
i'd
like
to
call
the
court?s
attention
to
the
congressional
intent
which
we
believe
controls
the
situation.
the
original
judiciary
article
--
judiciary
act
in
1789
was
limited
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
severely
in
the
nature
of
the
writs
which
they
could
issue.
and
i
think
as
it's
indicated
in
our
brief,
charles
warren
in
his
article
in
the
harvard
law
review
points
out
that
that
was
a
compromise
to
get
the
votes
of
those
in
the
constitutional
convention
who
were
willing
to
have
a
federal
constitution,
but
they
were
not
willing
to
have
federal
courts
with
unlimited
jurisdiction.
and
in
the
intervening
years,
since
1789,
congress
has
enacted
a
number
of
acts
in
which
it
has
conferred
on
the
federal
courts
mandamus
jurisdiction
in
certain
specified
isolated
areas.
for
example,
in
the
interstate
commerce
act,
jurisdiction
is
given
to
the
federal
court
to
issue
a
mandamus
against
a
carrier
to
file
tariffs,
but
it
does
not
give
mandamus
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
section
20
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
compels,
or
which
calls
upon
carriers
to
file
annual
reports
with
the
commission.
similarly,
in
1962,
congress
enacted
section
1361
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
code,
which
is
the
general
jurisdictional
section
of
title
28.
and
in
that
amendment,
it
was
provided
the
district
court
shall
have
original
jurisdiction
of
any
action
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
to
compel
an
officer
or
employee
of
the
united
states
or
any
agency
thereof,
to
perform
a
duty
owed
to
the
plaintiff.
it
was
--
it
would
have
been
very
easy
if
congress
had
wished
to
confer
unlimited
jurisdiction
upon
the
federal
courts
to
issue
orders
in
the
nature
of
mandamus.
to
have
simply
provided,
the
district
court
shall
have
original
jurisdiction
of
any
action
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
period,
but
congress
did
not
choose
to
do
that.
and
this
omission
was
not
inadvertent.
it
was
clearly
intentional,
because
if
the
court
please,
there
were
three
congressional
reports
filed
prepared
and
submitted
at
the
time
that
amendment
was
being
considered.
two
house
reports
and
one
senate
report,
and
in
each
of
those
reports
in
1962
there
appears
the
following
language.
the
single
exception
to
the
general
proposition
that
the
u.s.
district
courts
do
not
have
jurisdiction
over
original
actions
for
mandamus
is
the
u.s.
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
and
not
only
did
that
language
in
each
of
the
congressional
reports,
but
it
was
incorporated
into
the
congressional
record
at
the
request
of
senator
mansfield,
the
majority
leader,
at
the
time
that
that
bill
was
being
considered.
now,
we
submit
that
with
that
legislative
history
of
the
original
limitation
upon
the
power
of
the
federal
courts
in
1789,
the
limited
expansion
of
that
jurisdiction
over
the
intervening
years
enacts
such
as
the
interstate
commerce
act.
and
the
conduct
of
congress
in
1962
in
passing
this
limited
amendment
to
the
jurisdictional
statute
providing
for
the
issuance
of
writs
of
mandamus
solely
as
to
public
officers
of
the
united
states,
not
as
to
state
officers,
not
as
to
local
officers
and
not
as
to
corporations.
if
there
is
to
be
any
change
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
in
the
area
of
the
issuance
of
writs
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
where
that
is
the
only
relief
sought,
this
change
should
come
from
congress
through
a
considered
study
of
the
situation
and
consultation
with
the
bench
and
bar
of
the
legal
organizations
and
full
study
of
the
consequences
of
such
a
change.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
we
would
be
happy
to
and
we're
prepared
to
litigate
it
in
either
the
federal
court
or
the
state
court
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
reason
we
raised
the
jurisdictional
question
was
that
we
knew
that
jurisdictional
questions
can
be
raised
at
any
time
up
to
the
end
of
the
case
even
on
the
court's
own
motion.
and
we
didn't
want
to
get
to
the
end
of
this
case
after
a
long
trial
and
then
appeal,
and
then
find
that
some
court
would
say
that
the
federal
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
so
we
felt
that
it
was
important
to
get
that
question
decided
as
soon
as
was
convenient.
it
was
not
because
we
did
not
want
to
litigate
it.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
believe
mr.
freeman
inadvertently
misspoke
on
that.
what
happened
was
that
the
plaintiff
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
which
was
denied.
we
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
jurisdictional
ground
and
that
was
granted.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i'd
like
if
i
may
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
don't
think
we
would
suffer
any
injury.
i
think
there
is
no
policy
consideration
that
i
can
see
why
a
federal
court
should
not
be
able
to
issue
a
writ
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
where
that?s
the
only
relief
sought.
on
the
other
hand
i
think
that
there's
no
policy
consideration
necessarily
why
the
federal
courts
should
want
to
intervene
in
this
kind
of
a
matter
where
it's
purely
between
a
stockholder
and
a
corporation
of
a
state
under
the
state
law
where
there
is
no
suggestion
that
the
state
court
isn't
in
a
position
to
fairly
and
adequately
handle
the
case.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
if
that's
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
yes,
as
i
understand
it
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
if
that
--
if
the
plaintiff
were
to
request
that
as
his
only
relief,
as
we
understand
it
that
is
relief
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
and
that
is
jurisdictionally
prohibited.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
think
he
would
be
entitled
to
get
a
declaratory
judgment
assuming
that
the
jurisdictional
statutes
of
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
yes.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
yes.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
yes.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
honestly
can't
answer
why
congress
felt
that
federal
court
should
not
be
able
issue
mandatory
orders
with
--
unless
it's
in
aid
of
other
jurisdiction.
apparently,
it
is
historical
and
i
don't,
as
i
say,
see
any
present
policy
reason
why
not.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
well,
except
that
this
one
has
been
long
continued
and
apparently,
intentionally
by
congress.
may
i
turn
for
a
moment
your
honors
to
the
question
of
affect
of
erie
against
tompkins
upon
the
court?s
view
of
this
case?
judge
ganey's
dissent
in
the
court
of
appeals
argues
that
under
the
doctrine
of
erie
against
tompkins,
a
federal
court
in
a
diversity
case
ought
to
be
able
to
grant
the
identical
relief
to
a
plaintiff
which
he
would
have
gotten
if
he
had
gone
into
the
state
court.
and
it
appears
to
be
judge
ganey's
contention
that
erie
against
tompkins
deals
not
only
with
the
rules
of
law
to
be
applied
by
the
court,
but
with
the
remedies
which
the
court
is
able
to
grant.
as
i
read
erie
against
tompkins,
it
deals
with
the
interpretation
of
the
rules
of
decision
act
and
holds
that
in
deciding
a
case
on
the
merits,
the
federal
court
sitting
in
a
diversity
case
should
apply
not
only
the
statutory
law
of
the
state
in
which
it
sits
but
also
the
common
law
decided
by
the
courts
of
that
state.
so
that
a
decision
on
the
merits
of
that
case
would
not
be
different
for
a
plaintiff
in
the
federal
court
that
it
would
have
been
in
the
state
court
because
of
rules
of
decision
which
would
applied
differently
in
the
state
court
from
the
federal
court.
and
as
i
read
guarantee
trust
company
against
york,
the
so
called
outcome
determinative
test
which
is
been
widely
referred
to
is
really
a
test
as
to
what
rules
of
decision
will
be
applied.
and
we
submit
that
neither
--
that
this
court
in
deciding
erie
against
tompkins
and
guarantee
trust
company
against
york
did
not
intend
to
decide
that
not
only
must
the
rules
of
decision
of
the
state
be
applied
in
determining
the
answer
on
the
merits,
but
also
that
every
remedy
available
in
a
state
court
must
be
available
in
the
federal
court
in
a
diversity
case.
and
i
submit
that
this
court
didn't
intend
to
say
that
because
of
the
recognized
jurisdictional
limitations
on
certain
kinds
of
cases
which
the
federal
courts
are
not
at
liberty
to
consider
and
decide.
i
would
like
to
offer
to
the
court
two
or
three
examples
in
this
connection.
section
1332
of
title
28
provides
that
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction
in
a
civil
action.
it
has
long
been
held
that
civil
--
the
word
civil
action
does
not
include
ordinary
domestic
relations
cases,
support
orders,
illegitimacy
determinations
and
that
sort
of
thing.
it
is
also
been
held
that
civil
action
does
not
include
such
things
as
will
contests
and
administration
of
estates
and
trusts
which
are
customarily
left
to
the
state
courts
to
decide,
but
if
judge
ganey's
theory
were
carried
out,
if
there
were
diversity
of
citizenship
and
a
jurisdictional
amount
involved,
and
if
the
plaintiff
could
go
into
the
state
court
and
get
relief
in
a
domestic
relations
case
or
in
a
will
contest
the
federal
court
ought
to
be
able
to
grant
him
that
same
relief
without
regard
to
any
jurisdictional
limitations.
let
me
offer
another
example.
the
norris-laguardia
act
imposes
a
jurisdictional
limitation
which
prevents
federal
courts
from
granting
injunctions
in
labor
disputes,
but
there
are
14
states
which
have
no
little
norris-laguardia
act.
and
in
those
14
states,
a
plaintiff
can
go
into
the
state
court
and
obtain
an
injunction
in
the
labor
dispute.
if
judge
ganey's
interpretation
of
erie
against
tompkins
were
correct,
a
plaintiff
in
a
diversity
case
ought
to
be
able
to
come
into
the
federal
court
and
obtain
an
injunction
in
a
labor
dispute
regardless
of
the
jurisdictional
limitations
imposed
by
congress
under
the
norris-laguardia
act.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
say
that
i
don't
know
what
the
jurisdiction
of
the
supreme
court
is
under
these
circumstances,
but
the
federal
as
i
understand
the
norris-laguardia
act,
the
federal
district
courts
do
not
have
authority
to
issue
injunctions
in
general
in
labor
disputes.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
your
honor
because
i
don't
know
enough
about
the
workings
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
think
not
your
honor
in
either
case
because
if
the
norris-laguardia
act
says,
as
i
believe
it
does,
that
a
federal
court
cannot
issue
an
injunction
in
a
labor
dispute.
by
the
same
token,
a
federal
court
cannot
issue
an
order
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
in
this
situation.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
think
under
the
declaratory
judgments
act,
if
there
is
a
justiceable
controversy
you
--
it
can
give
a
declaratory
judgment
as
to
rights.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
feel
your
honor
that
equitable
jurisdiction
is
something
different.
it
involves
inherently
the
lack
of
an
adequate
remedy
at
law.
and
if
to
aid
supporting
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
as
we
understand
the
all
writs
act,
the
court
cannot
entertain
an
action
in
which
the
only
relief
sought
is
a
mandatory
order
which
is
not
in
aid
of
some
other
jurisdiction
such
as
equitable
jurisdiction.
now,
we
submit,
if
the
court
please
that
faced
with
the
language
of
the
all
writs
act
with
the
clear
intent
of
congress
as
it
has
been
reflected
as
recently
as
1962,
and
with
the
interpretation
of
erie
against
tompkins,
as
we
understand
it,
that
it
deals
with
rules
of
decision
and
not
with
conferring
remedies
upon
a
federal
court
in
a
diversity
case.
that
this
court
should
not
interpret
erie
against
tompkins
or
the
all
writs
act
in
a
manner
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
intent
of
congress,
and
therefore
we
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
be
affirmed.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall,
if
a
federal
court
had
some
remedy
whether
it's
called
mandamus
or
equity
or
whatever
it's
called,
by
which
a
plaintiff
can
obtain
relief
in
the
state
court
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
think
the
state
court
certainly
would.
i
don't
think
it
matters
what
it's
labeled.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
yes,
i
don't
think
it
matters
what
the
case
is
labeled
your
honor.
the
question
is
whether
the
relief
sought
is
in
the
nature
of
mandamus.
not
a
writ
of
mandamus
but
something
which
congress
considered
to
be
in
the
nature
of
mandamus.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
yes
it
is,
but
there
is
inherent
in
a
mandatory
injunction
as
i
believe
i've
said
to
mr.
justice
white,
the
existence
of
some
need
for
equitable
relief
and
not
an
ordinary
adequate
remedy
at
law,
which
is
available
to
the
plaintiff
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
that's
right.
and
in
order
for
the
court
to
obtain
jurisdiction,
it
must
first
be
demonstrated
that
the
plaintiff
does
not
have
the
adequate
remedy
at
law
in
the
state
court
which
it
does
no
matter
what
the
relief
is
called
in
the
state
court.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
believe
that
equitable
jurisdiction
is
a
jurisdictional
fact,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
that's
correct.
the
fact
that
there
is
one
form
of
act
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
think
the
fact
that
there
is
one
form
of
action
called
a
complaint,
a
civil
action,
does
not
determine
the
nature
of
the
relief.
and
if
the
nature
of
the
relief
sought
is
equitable
relief,
it
is
necessary
for
the
court
to
find
that
there
is
an
inadequate
remedy
at
law
in
order
for
jurisdiction
to
be
conferred.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
well,
i
think
at
the
outset
your
honor,
the
complaint
and
the
answer
will
raise
the
facts
with
--
will
present
the
facts
for
the
court
with
respect
to
the
existence
of
an
adequate
remedy
at
law.
and
that
would
be
a
threshold
determination
by
the
court
before
it
could
determine
what
relief
to
grant.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
would
the
state
court
or
the
federal
court,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
think
that
that
would
be
the
determination
of
an
ordinary
damage
action
would
be
a
civil
action
in
the
ordinary
sense
in
which
a
mandatory
order
is
not
being
asked,
it's
merely
the
award
of
damages
and
that
would
be
within
the
court's
jurisdiction
and
the
court
could
decide
the
case
and
grant
that
relief.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
question
your
honor
but
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
that
the
power
to
enforce
a
judgment
is
inherent
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
without
regard
with
to
any
question
as
to
whether
it's
a
merely
mandatory
order.
i
think
that
a
writ
of
execution
on
a
judgment
would
take
care
of
that
aspect
of
the
problem.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
concede
your
honor
that
there
does
not
seem
to
be
any
policy
reason
why
a
federal
court
should
not
be
able
to
grant
a
mandatory
order
where
that's
the
only
relief
asked.
i
see
no
objection
to
congress
giving
that
power
to
the
court.
all
i
say
is
that
congress
has
not
given
that
power
to
the
court
and
i
don't
think
that
erie
against
tompkins
or
any
interpretation
of
it
gives
that
power
to
the
court
to
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
the
issue
would
be
litigated
in
the
federal
court
as
to
plaintiff's
right
to
the
relief
he
seeks,
in
the
same
way
that
it
would've
been
in
the
state
court,
that's
correct
your
honor,
but
i
don't
know
why
with
the
present
crowding
of
the
federal
dockets
in
diversity
cases,
there
would
be
any
need
for
any
policy
reason
why
a
federal
court
would
want
to
assert
jurisdiction
in
a
case
in
which
that
is
the
only
relief
that's
asked.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
well,
i
agree
your
honor,
if
there
was
any
question
that
justice
would
be
better
in
the
federal
court
than
in
the
state
court
in
a
situation
involving
a
corporations
--
the
requirements
of
enforcing
the
corporations
duty
to
disclose
its
records,
then
there
might
be
a
federal
policy
consideration
which
would
militate
in
favor
of
a
change
in
the
law
on
that
subject.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
while
it
is
true
that
the
narrow
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
a
federal
district
court
has
jurisdiction
to
issue
a
mandatory
order
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
where
that
is
the
only
relief
requested.
there
is
a
much
more
fundamental
issue
which
is
presented
by
this
case.
and
that
is
whether
an
individual
state
by
conferring
a
certain
right
and
a
certain
remedy
upon
a
plaintiff
which
remedy
is
enforceable
in
the
in
the
state
courts
can
thereby
expand
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
in
a
diversity
case
so
as
to
grant
the
same
remedy
to
that
plaintiff
in
spite
of
the
jurisdictional
limitations
contained
in
the
acts
of
congress
with
respect
to
the
federal
court.
i
think
it's
clear
in
this
case
that
the
relief
requested
by
the
plaintiff
is
in
the
nature
of
mandamus.
that
is,
it
is
a
mandatory
order
directed
to
a
corporation
to
disclose
certain
records
which
the
plaintiff
wishes
to
see,
and
i
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor,
because
in
the
case
of
smith
against
bourbon
county
in
this
court,
it
was
said
that
this
remedy
is
a
--
the
objection
to
the
granting
of
this
remedy
is
a
substantive
one
and
that
it
cannot
be
cured
by
converting
the
action
into
an
equitable
action
or
by
calling
it
by
any
other
name.
if
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
mandamus,
that
is
a
mandatory
order
directed
to
someone
to
carry
out
an
act,
it
is
subject
to
the
jurisdictional
objection.
i
think
it
is
important
for
us
in
this
connection
to
examine
the
language
of
the
act
which
is
being
considered
here.
the
old
writs
act
which
is
found
in
section
1651
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
code.
that
language
says
that,
the
supreme
court
and
all
courts
established
by
acts
of
congress
may
issue
all
writs
necessary
or
appropriate
in
aid
of
their
respective
jurisdictions.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
don't
think
i
meant
to
say
that
your
honor,
but
i
did.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
what
i
intended
to
say
was
that
in
the
case
of
smith
versus
bourbon
county
the
court's
words
were,
this
court
would
be
without
jurisdiction
and
certainly
that
lack
of
jurisdiction
cannot
be
supplied
by
converting
the
proceeding
into
a
bill
in
equity.
the
objection
is
one
of
substance
and
not
merely
of
form.
it
cannot
be
waived
and
it
can
not
be
ignored.
and
i
believe
that
in
answer
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
harlan
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
yes,
well
i
submit
that
any
action
in
which
the
relief
requested
is
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
whether
it
is
called
an
equitable
action
or
a
mandatory
injunction
action.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
--
it's
the
substantive
nature
of
the
relief
requested,
that's
correct.
a
mandatory
order
in
which
there
is
no
other
jurisdictional
aspect
such
as
lack
of
adequate
remedy
at
law.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
well,
my
understanding
of
the
original
meaning
of
mandamus
is
that
it
was
an
order
by
the
court
directed
to
a
lower
court
to
a
judicial
officer,
to
a
federal
officer,
to
a
state
officer
or
to
a
corporate
officer
to
do
an
act.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
think,
if
the
court
please,
if
that
order
is
the
result
of
a
federal
arbitration
act
for
example
it
is
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
--
it?s
true,
it's
a
mandatory
order.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
yes,
i
think
it
is
a
mandatory
order
but
if
it
is
granted
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
--
if
it
is
granted
in
aid
of
the
court's
jurisdiction
otherwise
acquired,
the
court
has
the
power
to
issue
it.
if
there
is
no
other
ground
for
federal
jurisdiction
or
if
the
relief
requested
is
not
in
aid
of
that
jurisdiction,
the
mandatory
which
is
requested,
if
that
is
the
only
relief
sought
is
without
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
that
sounds
to
me
like
an
ordinary
equitable
action
in
which
the
relief
sought
is
mandatory
injunction,
and
if
there
is
an
inadequate
remedy
at
law
and
if
the
court
feels
that
it
is
necessary
to
issue
that
order
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction,
the
court
would
have
power
to
issue.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
think
the
federal
courts
have
equitable
jurisdiction
where
there
is
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
and
where
there's
an
inadequate
remedy
at
law.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
if
there
were
an
adequate
remedy
at
law
and
if
there
were
merely
diversity
and
jurisdictional
amount
involved
and
the
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
think
that
if
the
court
has
equitable
jurisdiction
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
if
the
court
has
equitable
jurisdiction,
your
honor,
and
if
it
feels
that
in
order
to
enforce
that
jurisdiction
it
needs
to
issue
the
mandatory
order,
it
has
jurisdiction
to
issue.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
there
is
clearly
an
adequate
remedy
at
law
in
the
state
court.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
an
action
which
is
denominated
in
the
state
court,
mandamus.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
there
are
certain
records
of
this
corporation
which
this
plaintiff
has
requested
which
we
have
declined
to
disclose
to
him.
they
are
records
relating
to
the
earnings
of
wholly
owned
subsidiaries
of
this
corporation.
and
we
have
declined
on
the
grounds
of
the
lack
of
good
faith
of
this
plaintiff,
but
i
think
that
would
be
an
issue
on
the
merits
which
would
be
decided
in
the
state
court
applying
the
rules
of
law
applicable
to
corporations
of
that
state.
and
if
the
plaintiff
made
out
a
proper
case,
the
state
court
would
grant
him
that
relief
and
there
is
no
suggestion
that
i
know
of
that
the
federal
court
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
as
we
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
say
that
where
there
is
no
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
in
this
situation,
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
--
there
is
an
adequate
remedy
at
law
available
to
the
plaintiff
in
the
state
court
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
think
your
honor
the
jurisdiction
is
limited
in
by
section
1332.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
if
there's
an
adequate
remedy
at
law,
the
court
does
not
have
equitable
jurisdiction.
if
it
is
not
a
civil
action
the
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
no.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i'm
not
contending
for
that.
i'm
suggesting
that
if
the
federal
court
has
jurisdiction
to
grant
equitable
relief,
it
can
issue
a
mandatory
order
in
order
of
that
injunction
--
that
jurisdiction.
but
where
the
only
remedy
sought
is
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
with
no
equitable
considerations
involved,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
does
not
lie.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
yes.
i'd
like
to
call
the
court?s
attention
to
the
congressional
intent
which
we
believe
controls
the
situation.
the
original
judiciary
article
--
judiciary
act
in
1789
was
limited
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
severely
in
the
nature
of
the
writs
which
they
could
issue.
and
i
think
as
it's
indicated
in
our
brief,
charles
warren
in
his
article
in
the
harvard
law
review
points
out
that
that
was
a
compromise
to
get
the
votes
of
those
in
the
constitutional
convention
who
were
willing
to
have
a
federal
constitution,
but
they
were
not
willing
to
have
federal
courts
with
unlimited
jurisdiction.
and
in
the
intervening
years,
since
1789,
congress
has
enacted
a
number
of
acts
in
which
it
has
conferred
on
the
federal
courts
mandamus
jurisdiction
in
certain
specified
isolated
areas.
for
example,
in
the
interstate
commerce
act,
jurisdiction
is
given
to
the
federal
court
to
issue
a
mandamus
against
a
carrier
to
file
tariffs,
but
it
does
not
give
mandamus
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
section
20
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
compels,
or
which
calls
upon
carriers
to
file
annual
reports
with
the
commission.
similarly,
in
1962,
congress
enacted
section
1361
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
code,
which
is
the
general
jurisdictional
section
of
title
28.
and
in
that
amendment,
it
was
provided
the
district
court
shall
have
original
jurisdiction
of
any
action
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
to
compel
an
officer
or
employee
of
the
united
states
or
any
agency
thereof,
to
perform
a
duty
owed
to
the
plaintiff.
it
was
--
it
would
have
been
very
easy
if
congress
had
wished
to
confer
unlimited
jurisdiction
upon
the
federal
courts
to
issue
orders
in
the
nature
of
mandamus.
to
have
simply
provided,
the
district
court
shall
have
original
jurisdiction
of
any
action
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
period,
but
congress
did
not
choose
to
do
that.
and
this
omission
was
not
inadvertent.
it
was
clearly
intentional,
because
if
the
court
please,
there
were
three
congressional
reports
filed
prepared
and
submitted
at
the
time
that
amendment
was
being
considered.
two
house
reports
and
one
senate
report,
and
in
each
of
those
reports
in
1962
there
appears
the
following
language.
the
single
exception
to
the
general
proposition
that
the
u.s.
district
courts
do
not
have
jurisdiction
over
original
actions
for
mandamus
is
the
u.s.
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
and
not
only
did
that
language
in
each
of
the
congressional
reports,
but
it
was
incorporated
into
the
congressional
record
at
the
request
of
senator
mansfield,
the
majority
leader,
at
the
time
that
that
bill
was
being
considered.
now,
we
submit
that
with
that
legislative
history
of
the
original
limitation
upon
the
power
of
the
federal
courts
in
1789,
the
limited
expansion
of
that
jurisdiction
over
the
intervening
years
enacts
such
as
the
interstate
commerce
act.
and
the
conduct
of
congress
in
1962
in
passing
this
limited
amendment
to
the
jurisdictional
statute
providing
for
the
issuance
of
writs
of
mandamus
solely
as
to
public
officers
of
the
united
states,
not
as
to
state
officers,
not
as
to
local
officers
and
not
as
to
corporations.
if
there
is
to
be
any
change
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
in
the
area
of
the
issuance
of
writs
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
where
that
is
the
only
relief
sought,
this
change
should
come
from
congress
through
a
considered
study
of
the
situation
and
consultation
with
the
bench
and
bar
of
the
legal
organizations
and
full
study
of
the
consequences
of
such
a
change.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
we
would
be
happy
to
and
we're
prepared
to
litigate
it
in
either
the
federal
court
or
the
state
court
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
reason
we
raised
the
jurisdictional
question
was
that
we
knew
that
jurisdictional
questions
can
be
raised
at
any
time
up
to
the
end
of
the
case
even
on
the
court's
own
motion.
and
we
didn't
want
to
get
to
the
end
of
this
case
after
a
long
trial
and
then
appeal,
and
then
find
that
some
court
would
say
that
the
federal
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
so
we
felt
that
it
was
important
to
get
that
question
decided
as
soon
as
was
convenient.
it
was
not
because
we
did
not
want
to
litigate
it.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
believe
mr.
freeman
inadvertently
misspoke
on
that.
what
happened
was
that
the
plaintiff
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
which
was
denied.
we
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
jurisdictional
ground
and
that
was
granted.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i'd
like
if
i
may
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
don't
think
we
would
suffer
any
injury.
i
think
there
is
no
policy
consideration
that
i
can
see
why
a
federal
court
should
not
be
able
to
issue
a
writ
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
where
that?s
the
only
relief
sought.
on
the
other
hand
i
think
that
there's
no
policy
consideration
necessarily
why
the
federal
courts
should
want
to
intervene
in
this
kind
of
a
matter
where
it's
purely
between
a
stockholder
and
a
corporation
of
a
state
under
the
state
law
where
there
is
no
suggestion
that
the
state
court
isn't
in
a
position
to
fairly
and
adequately
handle
the
case.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
if
that's
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
yes,
as
i
understand
it
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
if
that
--
if
the
plaintiff
were
to
request
that
as
his
only
relief,
as
we
understand
it
that
is
relief
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
and
that
is
jurisdictionally
prohibited.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
think
he
would
be
entitled
to
get
a
declaratory
judgment
assuming
that
the
jurisdictional
statutes
of
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
yes.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
yes.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
yes.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
honestly
can't
answer
why
congress
felt
that
federal
court
should
not
be
able
issue
mandatory
orders
with
--
unless
it's
in
aid
of
other
jurisdiction.
apparently,
it
is
historical
and
i
don't,
as
i
say,
see
any
present
policy
reason
why
not.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
well,
except
that
this
one
has
been
long
continued
and
apparently,
intentionally
by
congress.
may
i
turn
for
a
moment
your
honors
to
the
question
of
affect
of
erie
against
tompkins
upon
the
court?s
view
of
this
case?
judge
ganey's
dissent
in
the
court
of
appeals
argues
that
under
the
doctrine
of
erie
against
tompkins,
a
federal
court
in
a
diversity
case
ought
to
be
able
to
grant
the
identical
relief
to
a
plaintiff
which
he
would
have
gotten
if
he
had
gone
into
the
state
court.
and
it
appears
to
be
judge
ganey's
contention
that
erie
against
tompkins
deals
not
only
with
the
rules
of
law
to
be
applied
by
the
court,
but
with
the
remedies
which
the
court
is
able
to
grant.
as
i
read
erie
against
tompkins,
it
deals
with
the
interpretation
of
the
rules
of
decision
act
and
holds
that
in
deciding
a
case
on
the
merits,
the
federal
court
sitting
in
a
diversity
case
should
apply
not
only
the
statutory
law
of
the
state
in
which
it
sits
but
also
the
common
law
decided
by
the
courts
of
that
state.
so
that
a
decision
on
the
merits
of
that
case
would
not
be
different
for
a
plaintiff
in
the
federal
court
that
it
would
have
been
in
the
state
court
because
of
rules
of
decision
which
would
applied
differently
in
the
state
court
from
the
federal
court.
and
as
i
read
guarantee
trust
company
against
york,
the
so
called
outcome
determinative
test
which
is
been
widely
referred
to
is
really
a
test
as
to
what
rules
of
decision
will
be
applied.
and
we
submit
that
neither
--
that
this
court
in
deciding
erie
against
tompkins
and
guarantee
trust
company
against
york
did
not
intend
to
decide
that
not
only
must
the
rules
of
decision
of
the
state
be
applied
in
determining
the
answer
on
the
merits,
but
also
that
every
remedy
available
in
a
state
court
must
be
available
in
the
federal
court
in
a
diversity
case.
and
i
submit
that
this
court
didn't
intend
to
say
that
because
of
the
recognized
jurisdictional
limitations
on
certain
kinds
of
cases
which
the
federal
courts
are
not
at
liberty
to
consider
and
decide.
i
would
like
to
offer
to
the
court
two
or
three
examples
in
this
connection.
section
1332
of
title
28
provides
that
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction
in
a
civil
action.
it
has
long
been
held
that
civil
--
the
word
civil
action
does
not
include
ordinary
domestic
relations
cases,
support
orders,
illegitimacy
determinations
and
that
sort
of
thing.
it
is
also
been
held
that
civil
action
does
not
include
such
things
as
will
contests
and
administration
of
estates
and
trusts
which
are
customarily
left
to
the
state
courts
to
decide,
but
if
judge
ganey's
theory
were
carried
out,
if
there
were
diversity
of
citizenship
and
a
jurisdictional
amount
involved,
and
if
the
plaintiff
could
go
into
the
state
court
and
get
relief
in
a
domestic
relations
case
or
in
a
will
contest
the
federal
court
ought
to
be
able
to
grant
him
that
same
relief
without
regard
to
any
jurisdictional
limitations.
let
me
offer
another
example.
the
norris-laguardia
act
imposes
a
jurisdictional
limitation
which
prevents
federal
courts
from
granting
injunctions
in
labor
disputes,
but
there
are
14
states
which
have
no
little
norris-laguardia
act.
and
in
those
14
states,
a
plaintiff
can
go
into
the
state
court
and
obtain
an
injunction
in
the
labor
dispute.
if
judge
ganey's
interpretation
of
erie
against
tompkins
were
correct,
a
plaintiff
in
a
diversity
case
ought
to
be
able
to
come
into
the
federal
court
and
obtain
an
injunction
in
a
labor
dispute
regardless
of
the
jurisdictional
limitations
imposed
by
congress
under
the
norris-laguardia
act.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
say
that
i
don't
know
what
the
jurisdiction
of
the
supreme
court
is
under
these
circumstances,
but
the
federal
as
i
understand
the
norris-laguardia
act,
the
federal
district
courts
do
not
have
authority
to
issue
injunctions
in
general
in
labor
disputes.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
your
honor
because
i
don't
know
enough
about
the
workings
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
think
not
your
honor
in
either
case
because
if
the
norris-laguardia
act
says,
as
i
believe
it
does,
that
a
federal
court
cannot
issue
an
injunction
in
a
labor
dispute.
by
the
same
token,
a
federal
court
cannot
issue
an
order
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
in
this
situation.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
think
under
the
declaratory
judgments
act,
if
there
is
a
justiceable
controversy
you
--
it
can
give
a
declaratory
judgment
as
to
rights.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
feel
your
honor
that
equitable
jurisdiction
is
something
different.
it
involves
inherently
the
lack
of
an
adequate
remedy
at
law.
and
if
to
aid
supporting
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
as
we
understand
the
all
writs
act,
the
court
cannot
entertain
an
action
in
which
the
only
relief
sought
is
a
mandatory
order
which
is
not
in
aid
of
some
other
jurisdiction
such
as
equitable
jurisdiction.
now,
we
submit,
if
the
court
please
that
faced
with
the
language
of
the
all
writs
act
with
the
clear
intent
of
congress
as
it
has
been
reflected
as
recently
as
1962,
and
with
the
interpretation
of
erie
against
tompkins,
as
we
understand
it,
that
it
deals
with
rules
of
decision
and
not
with
conferring
remedies
upon
a
federal
court
in
a
diversity
case.
that
this
court
should
not
interpret
erie
against
tompkins
or
the
all
writs
act
in
a
manner
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
intent
of
congress,
and
therefore
we
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
be
affirmed.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall,
if
a
federal
court
had
some
remedy
whether
it's
called
mandamus
or
equity
or
whatever
it's
called,
by
which
a
plaintiff
can
obtain
relief
in
the
state
court
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
think
the
state
court
certainly
would.
i
don't
think
it
matters
what
it's
labeled.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
yes,
i
don't
think
it
matters
what
the
case
is
labeled
your
honor.
the
question
is
whether
the
relief
sought
is
in
the
nature
of
mandamus.
not
a
writ
of
mandamus
but
something
which
congress
considered
to
be
in
the
nature
of
mandamus.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
yes
it
is,
but
there
is
inherent
in
a
mandatory
injunction
as
i
believe
i've
said
to
mr.
justice
white,
the
existence
of
some
need
for
equitable
relief
and
not
an
ordinary
adequate
remedy
at
law,
which
is
available
to
the
plaintiff
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
that's
right.
and
in
order
for
the
court
to
obtain
jurisdiction,
it
must
first
be
demonstrated
that
the
plaintiff
does
not
have
the
adequate
remedy
at
law
in
the
state
court
which
it
does
no
matter
what
the
relief
is
called
in
the
state
court.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
believe
that
equitable
jurisdiction
is
a
jurisdictional
fact,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
that's
correct.
the
fact
that
there
is
one
form
of
act
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
think
the
fact
that
there
is
one
form
of
action
called
a
complaint,
a
civil
action,
does
not
determine
the
nature
of
the
relief.
and
if
the
nature
of
the
relief
sought
is
equitable
relief,
it
is
necessary
for
the
court
to
find
that
there
is
an
inadequate
remedy
at
law
in
order
for
jurisdiction
to
be
conferred.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
well,
i
think
at
the
outset
your
honor,
the
complaint
and
the
answer
will
raise
the
facts
with
--
will
present
the
facts
for
the
court
with
respect
to
the
existence
of
an
adequate
remedy
at
law.
and
that
would
be
a
threshold
determination
by
the
court
before
it
could
determine
what
relief
to
grant.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
would
the
state
court
or
the
federal
court,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
think
that
that
would
be
the
determination
of
an
ordinary
damage
action
would
be
a
civil
action
in
the
ordinary
sense
in
which
a
mandatory
order
is
not
being
asked,
it's
merely
the
award
of
damages
and
that
would
be
within
the
court's
jurisdiction
and
the
court
could
decide
the
case
and
grant
that
relief.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
question
your
honor
but
--
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
that
the
power
to
enforce
a
judgment
is
inherent
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
without
regard
with
to
any
question
as
to
whether
it's
a
merely
mandatory
order.
i
think
that
a
writ
of
execution
on
a
judgment
would
take
care
of
that
aspect
of
the
problem.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
i
concede
your
honor
that
there
does
not
seem
to
be
any
policy
reason
why
a
federal
court
should
not
be
able
to
grant
a
mandatory
order
where
that's
the
only
relief
asked.
i
see
no
objection
to
congress
giving
that
power
to
the
court.
all
i
say
is
that
congress
has
not
given
that
power
to
the
court
and
i
don't
think
that
erie
against
tompkins
or
any
interpretation
of
it
gives
that
power
to
the
court
to
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
the
issue
would
be
litigated
in
the
federal
court
as
to
plaintiff's
right
to
the
relief
he
seeks,
in
the
same
way
that
it
would've
been
in
the
state
court,
that's
correct
your
honor,
but
i
don't
know
why
with
the
present
crowding
of
the
federal
dockets
in
diversity
cases,
there
would
be
any
need
for
any
policy
reason
why
a
federal
court
would
want
to
assert
jurisdiction
in
a
case
in
which
that
is
the
only
relief
that's
asked.
mr.
richard
p.
brown,
jr.
well,
i
agree
your
honor,
if
there
was
any
question
that
justice
would
be
better
in
the
federal
court
than
in
the
state
court
in
a
situation
involving
a
corporations
--
the
requirements
of
enforcing
the
corporations
duty
to
disclose
its
records,
then
there
might
be
a
federal
policy
consideration
which
would
militate
in
favor
of
a
change
in
the
law
on
that
subject.
thank
you,
sir.
