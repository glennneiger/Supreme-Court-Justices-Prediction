mr.
brown,
you
remember
mr.
justice
fortas
just
asked
mr.
freeman
why
he
didn't
go
into
state
court.
would
it
be
unfair
for
me
to
ask
you
why
you
are
unwilling
to
litigate
the
point
as
to
whether
or
not
your
duty
bound
to
turn
these
books
over
in
the
federal
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
--
you
were
the
one
that
filed
for
the
summary
judgment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
that's
what
i
--
well
thank
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
asked
you
what
injury
your
crime
would
suffer
by
having
this
litigated
into
federal
instead
of
the
state
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
there's
no
writ
of
mandamus
or
a
writ
of
something
else
issued,
would
you
deny
that
the
federal
court
has
jurisdiction.
justice
thurgood
marshall
aside
this
issue.
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
turn
over
that
book,
would
you
deny
that
the
federal
court
has
jurisdiction
to
litigate
the
issue
of
whether
the
corporation
should
turn
over
its
books
to
the
litigant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
brown,
suppose
we
didn't
have
the
pennsylvania
procedure
for
mandamus
law
in
this,
and
they
filed
the
same
type
of
case,
would
the
federal
court
have
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i'm
talking
about
this
complaint
here.
what
for
the
fact
that
there
is
this
remedy
which
is
labeled
mandamus
in
pennsylvania,
would
this
be
a
good
complaint
and
would
the
court
have
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
complaint
is
in
the
federal
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
that's
--
i'm
with
mr.
justice
white
on
this,
i
mean,
isn't
a
mandatory
injunction
in
the
nature
of
mandamus.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
would
assume
that
mandatory
injunction
would
be
an
equitable
proceeding
i
would
assume
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
even
though
we
don't
have
separation
anymore
in
the
federal
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
something
still
holds
on
then.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
you
stick
to
your
jurisdictional
point,
how
does
the
district
court
get
jurisdiction
to
find
that
there
is
a
remedy
at
law?
you
either
have
jurisdiction
or
you
don't.
