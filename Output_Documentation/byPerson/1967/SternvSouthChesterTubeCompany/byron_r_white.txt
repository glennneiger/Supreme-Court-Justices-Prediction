justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
a
previous
case
here
in
the
court
held
that
at
anytime
a
federal
court
issues
an
order
to
a
party
to
carry
out
an
act
that
this
is
in
the
nature
of
mandamus.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
what
you
said,
now
what
did
you
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but,
go
ahead,
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
tell
that?
awhile
ago
you
said
you'd
tell
that
when
you
order
somebody
to
do
an
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
is
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
know
but
that
circular
that's
--
how
do
you
recognize
when
something
is
an
action
for
a
mandamus?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
an
order
to
arbitrate
address
to
a
corporation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
its
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
not
the
result
--
there
isn't
any
federal
act
which
requires
them
to
provide
for
arbitration,
this
is
a
contract,
contract
between
the
parties
to
arbitrate.
and
you
go
into
court
and
say
to
the
federal
court,
please
issue
in
order
to
arbitrate,
there's
been
a
breach
of
contract
and
the
other
party
refuses
to
arbitrate.
now
order
that
corporate
officer
to
arbitrate.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
is
that
in
the
nature
of
mandamus?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
federal
court
has
no
jurisdiction
in
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
that
be
true
of
any
specific
performance
in
any
diversity
case
where
the
action
is
on
a
contract
and
one
party
wants
the
other
party
order
to
specifically
perform
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
where
do
they
get
this
jurisdiction
otherwise
this
other
jurisdiction?
all
the
party
wants
when
it
comes
in
is
in
order
to
specifically
to
enforce
contract
against
this
corporation.
justice
byron
r.
white
diversity,
where
there's
diversity?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
no
adequate
remedy
at
law
and
there?s
diversity
jurisdiction,
and
yet
the
only
relief
sought
is
an
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
if
you
would
call
in
a
mandamus.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
where
do
you
--
how
do
you
distinguish
this
case?
this
is
diversity,
or
is
diversity
--
do
you
claim
there's
a
remedy
at
law
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
won't
turn
over
these
books
apparently.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
your
argument
is
only
whether
or
not
the
federal
court
ought
to
as
a
matter
of
equity
issue
this
order,
why
that?s
one
thing,
but
as
i
understand
it
do
you
say
that
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
either
to
get
to
that
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
certainly
don't
understand
then
how
you
distinguish
between
this
situation
and
the
enforcement
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
doesn't
destroy
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
just
may
go
to
whether
there's
equitable
--
whether
the
court
should
issue
an
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
be
--
are
you
suggesting
then
that
the
rule
for
which
you're
contending
is
just
that
in
these
circumstances
when
you
may
get
a
remedy
in
the
state
court,
an
injunction
should
not
issue.
and
if
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--court
has
no
jurisdiction
and
it's
just
an
ordinary
straightforward
question
of
whether
equitable
jurisdiction
should
be
exercised.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
we're
back
to
where
we
started
now
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
couldn't
obtain
that
in
the
case.
if
you
couldn't
get
the
injunction
in
federal
court,
you
say
therefore
you
shouldn?t
be
able
to
get
one
here
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
it
says,
but
would
you
suggest
in
that
case
that
the
federal
court
didn?t
have
jurisdiction
of
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it
would,
would
it
have
jurisdiction
in
this
case
before
us
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
could
give
a
declaratory
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
is
really
is
then
just
a
question
of
equitable
--
just
a
question
of
whether
or
not
this
is
an
appropriate
case
in
which
to
--
in
which
equity
should
act,
rather
than
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
all
you're
arguing
about
here?
i
thought
you're
telling
us
the
court
couldn't
entertain
the
action
at
all?
