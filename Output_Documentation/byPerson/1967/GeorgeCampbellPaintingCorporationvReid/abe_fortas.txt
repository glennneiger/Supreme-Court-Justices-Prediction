justice
abe
fortas
well,
don't
you
have
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
the
state
obtains
information
from
a
president
of
the
company
in
violation
of
his
fifth
amendment
rights
and
then
uses
that
--
the
information
in
a
proceeding
against
the
company
itself.
can
the
company
assert
the
individual's
fifth
amendment
privilege
for
the
purpose
of
excluding
that
evidence?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
if
it
cannot
object
in
that
case,
how
does
--
what's
the
basis
for
your
assertion
that
in
this
case,
the
corporation
can
in
effect
assert
the
privilege
on
the
behalf
of
one
of
its
officers.
justice
abe
fortas
your
argument
here
is
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
it
penalizes
the
exercise
of
fifth
amendment
rights.
that's
still
in
there?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you're
saying
that
the
penalty
imposed
by
the
statute
operates
upon
the
corporation.
justice
abe
fortas
and
here,
the
corporation
is
asserting
--
it
was
asserting
what
in
effect
you
urge
as
a
constitutional
right
of
the
individual
to
be
able
to
exercise
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
without
being
subjected
to
any
kind
of
penalty.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
think
it's
a
problem
in
this
case,
don't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
but
that
would
also
--
if
that
were
true
the
you
would
assume
that
the
corporation
wouldn't
be
able
successfully
to
oppose
a
tender
of
evidence
obtained
in
violation
of
its
president's
fifth
amendment
rights.
justice
abe
fortas
the
corporation
has
a
right
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
fair
trial
and
it
would
be
--
it
would
then
be
able
to
assert
as
part
of
that
right
as
to
have
excluded
from
use
against
if
evidence
unlawfully
obtained
from
its
president,
it
seems
to
me
that
one
would
follow
from
the
other?
no?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
signed
by
the
same
young
man,
this
24-year-old
man
who
resigned
after
all
these
started?
justice
abe
fortas
did
the
company
have
other
contracts
which
were
signed
by
somebody
else?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
like
federal
blacklist,
isn't
it?
this
federal
blacklist
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
isn't
quite
right.
it
isn't
quite
the
same
thing
though.
that's
what
--
a
bothersome
fact.
what
is
required
to
do
here
is
to
waive
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
perfectly
possible
to
grant
immunity
to
ask
the
questions
and
to
get
answers
to
the
questions.
so
what
is
happening
here
is
that
the
individual
or
the
corporation
is
given
the
opportunity
to
contract
with
the
state
only
if
the
individual
agrees
to
answer
questions
without
the
benefit
of
the
fifth
amendment.
and
that's
not
a
question
--
it's
not
a
matter
of
whether
the
state
can
or
cannot
get
answer
to
its
questions
because
the
state
can
get
answer
to
its
questions
by
grant
of
immunity
consistently
with
the
fifth
amendment.
isn't
that
so?
justice
abe
fortas
but
that's
not
quite
it.
here,
you
have
the
waiver
problem.
an
officer
--
you've
got
two
things
and
they're
may
be
very
different.
one
is
the
--
penalizing
the
corporation
for
the
refusal
of
its
officer
to
sign
a
waiver
and
the
other
is
penalizing
a
corporation
for
the
refusal
of
its
officer
to
reply
to
questions
within
the
--
which
are
relevant
to
the
contract
and
to
the
obligations
assumed.
now,
i
notice
that
in
your
argument,
you
run
those
two
things
together
but
when
you
look
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
federal
constitution.
is
there
not
a
difference
between
forgetting
your
separate
point
about
the
corporation's
right
to
claim
this?
is
there
not
a
difference
between
compelling
a
person
to
sign
a
waiver
of
his
right
--
of
his
fifth
amendment
rights
on
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand,
compelling
a
person
to
reply
to
questions
as
to
whether
he
as
well
and
faithfully
discharged
his
obligations
with
respect
to
a
public
contract?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
too
bad.
maybe
you
don't
have
another
statute
if
that
runs
a
file
of
the
federal
constitution
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
federal
constitutional
question.
as
i
read
the
statute,
it
relates
to
a
person
who
is
called
before
a
grand
jury
(a)
to
testify
or
(b)
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
or
(c)
to
answer
any
relevant
question.
and
if
he
refuses
to
do
anyone
of
those
things,
he
--
then
the
consequence
as
follow
that
corporation's
contract
is
terminated
and
he
is
blacklisted.
now,
in
the
present
case,
we
have
a
situation
which
this
man
is
called
before
the
grand
jury
to
testify
as
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity.
in
other
words,
as
to
sign
a
waiver
of
his
rights
under
the
federal
constitution
fifth
amendment
rights
and
he
refuses
to
do
so
and
therefore
release
the
consequences
attached.
now,
it
is
possible
that
that
presents
a
different
question
under
the
federal
constitution
regardless
of
practical
consequences.
that
would
be
preserved
if
he
had
declined
to
answer
a
question.
justice
abe
fortas
he
was
granted
immunity
--
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
he
had
been
granted
immunity
and
suppose
he'd
been
asked
a
question
about
this
whether
you
bribed
somebody
in
connection
with
obtaining
this
painting
contract
and
he
declined
to
answer
that
question
and
then
the
housing
authority
went
ahead
and
blacklist
him.
that
might
be
quite
a
different
question
viewed
in
the
light
of
the
federal
constitution.
justice
abe
fortas
well
the
only
--
all
of
these
disqualification
statutes
relate
only
to
appearances
before
the
grand
jury,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
and
none
of
them
for
example
relates
to
any
proceeding
for
the
sole
purpose
of
determining
the
eligibility
of
a
public
contractor.
justice
abe
fortas
so
they're
all
--
and
your
brother
spoke
before
you
said
that
new
york
--
the
grand
jury
always
--
the
grand
jury
can
exercise
its
powers
only
in
connection
with
its
investigation
of
alleged
criminal
violations,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
that
doesn't
make
to
what
the
other
counsel
said.
he
said
that
there
has
to
be
a
criminal
investigation
focused
to
a
grand
jury
investigation.
justice
abe
fortas
and
cannot
be
called
merely
for
an
investigatory
purpose.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
say
that
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
i
don't
want
to
take
anymore
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
don't
you
have
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
the
state
obtains
information
from
a
president
of
the
company
in
violation
of
his
fifth
amendment
rights
and
then
uses
that
--
the
information
in
a
proceeding
against
the
company
itself.
can
the
company
assert
the
individual's
fifth
amendment
privilege
for
the
purpose
of
excluding
that
evidence?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
if
it
cannot
object
in
that
case,
how
does
--
what's
the
basis
for
your
assertion
that
in
this
case,
the
corporation
can
in
effect
assert
the
privilege
on
the
behalf
of
one
of
its
officers.
justice
abe
fortas
your
argument
here
is
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
it
penalizes
the
exercise
of
fifth
amendment
rights.
that's
still
in
there?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you're
saying
that
the
penalty
imposed
by
the
statute
operates
upon
the
corporation.
justice
abe
fortas
and
here,
the
corporation
is
asserting
--
it
was
asserting
what
in
effect
you
urge
as
a
constitutional
right
of
the
individual
to
be
able
to
exercise
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
without
being
subjected
to
any
kind
of
penalty.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
think
it's
a
problem
in
this
case,
don't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
but
that
would
also
--
if
that
were
true
the
you
would
assume
that
the
corporation
wouldn't
be
able
successfully
to
oppose
a
tender
of
evidence
obtained
in

of
its

justice
abe
fortas
the
corporation
has
a
right
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
fair

and
it
would
be
--
it
would
then
be
able
to
assert
as
part
of
that
right
as
to
have
excluded
from
use
against
if
evidence
unlawfully
obtained
from
its

it
seems
to
me
that
one
would
follow
from
the
other?
no?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
signed
by
the
same
young
man,
this
24-year-old
man
who
resigned
after
all
these
started?
justice
abe
fortas
did
the
company
have
other
contracts
which
were
signed
by
somebody
else?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
like
federal
blacklist,
isn't
it?
this
federal
blacklist
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
isn't
quite
right.
it
isn't
quite
the
same
thing
though.
that's
what
--
a
bothersome
fact.
what
is
required
to
do
here
is
to
waive
the
protection
of
the
fifth

--
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
perfectly
possible
to
grant
immunity
to
ask
the
questions
and
to
get
answers
to
the
questions.
so
what
is
happening
here
is
that
the
individual
or
the
corporation
is
given
the
opportunity
to
contract
with
the
state
only
if
the
individual
agrees
to
answer
questions
without
the
benefit
of
the
fifth

and
that's
not
a
question
--
it's
not
a
matter
of
whether
the
state
can
or
cannot
get
answer
to
its
questions
because
the
state
can
get
answer
to
its
questions
by
grant
of
immunity
consistently
with
the
fifth
amendment.
isn't
that
so?
justice
abe
fortas
but
that's
not
quite
it.
here,
you
have
the
waiver
problem.
an
officer
--
you've
got
two
things
and
they're
may
be
very
different.
one
is
the

penalizing

is
penalizing
