justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
then
you'll
be
making
the
same
argument
if
the
president
hadn't
resigned.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
that
the
corporation
may
not
be
disqualified
from
contacting
with
the
city
even
though
none
of
its
officers
through
--
only
through
whom
the
corporation
can
speak
even
though
all
of
them
refused
to
testify.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
little
different
point
i
suppose
but
you
would
--
do
you
mean
if
there
had
been
an
administrative
hearing
and
the
same
people
have
refused
to
talk
about
the
corporation's
performance
of
its
contracts
that
you
wouldn't
be
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
any
event,
we
consider
this
case
as
though
it
would
be
the
same
issue
if
this
gentleman
have
not
resigned
and
that
this
was
a
--
that
one
of
the
officers
have
refused
to
testify
before
the
grand
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
corporation
ever
make
--
refer
to
the
city
that
it
was
willing
to
furnish
any
kind
of
information
through
its
other
officers?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
same
time,
is
this
gentleman
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
this
was
after
the
bids
has
been
--
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
corporation
--
i
suppose
the
corporation
was
powerless
to
secure
the
testimony
of
this
gentleman
who
resigned.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
hardly
--
for
whom
was
that
--
to
whose
benefit
was
that
advice?
for
whose
benefit
would
that
advice,
the
officers
or
the
corporation?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
saying
to
him,
you
either
waive
immunity
or
get
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
what
you're
objecting
to
the
city
during
the
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
--
even
if
the
--
even
if
the
city
could
require
a
public
employee
to
talk
or
lose
his
job,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
would
entitle
it
to
do
anything
at
all
to
these
officers
and
officer
this
--
well,
he
wasn't
working
for
the
city.
justice
byron
r.
white
his
only
recourse
would
be
against
the
corporation.
now
i
take
it
the
corporation
is
saying
that
we
did
all
we
could
to
cooperate.
we
couldn't
control
the
officer
if
we
would
have
--
could
have
gotten
his
testimony,
we
would
have
but
our
lives
are
an
open
book
except
for
him
and
we
can't
do
anything
about
him
and
you're
saying
that
it's
a
lack
of
due
process
to
be
cut
off
for
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
the
fact
is
that
there
maybe
some
things
about
the
corporate
business
that
the
city
hasn't
been
able
to
find
out
and
it
may
be
that
the
only
way
to
find
out
is
if
your
ex-officer
talk
but
he
will
not
talk.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
they
have
to
talk
--
didn't
the
officers
testify
what
the
other
officers
testified
for
grand
jury
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
waive
their
immunity
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
were
asked
questions?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
which
they
wanted
to
know
that
you
didn't
know
and
they
could
only
get
from
the
other
appellants.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
there
was
some
compulsion
only
to
talk.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
then
you'll
be
making
the
same

the
