chief

may
it
please
the

the
points
that
i
intend
to
make
the
duty
of
the
public
contractor
to
furnish
information
as
to
the
securing
and
the
execution
of
public
contracts
which
is
even
more
than
but
at
least
equal
to
to
that
of
a
public
employee
discussed
in
the
previous
case.
secondly,
the
expressed
waiver
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
the
contract
executed
pursuant
to
the
statute
and
the
lack
of
ability
of
the
appellant
corporation
to
challenge
the
requirement
for
a
limited
waiver
of
immunity
of
its
officers
which
it
undertook
in
the
contract
to
deliver
to
the
state
before
spevack
and
garrity
this
court
and
the
cases
mentioned
(inaudible)
and
nelson
in
various
areas
upheld
the
duty
of
candor,
the
obligation
of
public
employees
to
respond
to
calls
for
information.
these
cases
followed
chronologically
slochower
case
where
the
court
appears
to
have
made
the
type
of
inquiry
and
important
factor
and
applied
that
if
the
petitioner
there
had
invoked
the
privilege
at
an
inquiry
relevant
to
the
performance
of
his
duties,
the
outcome
would
have
been
different.
somebody
expressions
in
the
dissenting
opinion
by
various
justices
of
this
court
in
lenoir
and
nelson
indicated
to
emphasis
upon
the
type
of
inquiry
involved
in
the
particular
case.
the
attorney
general
upon
the
phases
of
a
study
of
the
cases
that
i've
referred
to,
recommended
the
legislation
that
is
under
consideration
by
this
court
and
then
the
governor
and
the
memorandum,
speaking
of
the
urgent
need
for
the
legislation
approved
it
and
the
governor's
memorandum
is
quoted
in
our
brief.
it
cannot
be
plausibly
disputed
that
the
inquiry
whose
subject
is
collusion
of
public
contractors
and
bidding
practice
involved
in
the
present
case
just
as
is
the
inquiry
as
to
the
police
officers'
performance
of
his
duties
involved
in
the
gardner
case
is
relevant.
the
claim
of
privilege
of
the
police
officers
in
the
previous
case
and
an
investigation
of
the
official
duties
of
such
officer
is
incompatible
with
the
duties
and
responsibilities
of
such
officers.
such
incompatibility
is
antagonistic
to
a
rational
system
of
law
enforcement
and
dismissal
for
lack
of
candor
in
such
circumstances
is
a
proper
exercise
that
i
submit
of
the
state's
police
power.
as
a
consequence,
every
state
case
to
which
we
have
been
referred
has
upheld
a
dismissal
of
such
public
officers
before
and
after
the
malloy
case
and
the
griffin
case
predicated
upon
the
paramount
right
of
the
people
to
protection
against
law
violation.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
district
of
columbia
court
contains
a
provision
which
is
similar
to
the
statute
under
consideration
here
and
has
an
additional
paragraph
which
refers
to
former
officers
and
says
if
they
refuse
to
testify
then
that
action
rights
can
be
abrogated.
and
the
uniform
rules
of
evidence
rule
25,
prepared
by
the
uniform
commissioners,
is
in
line
with
this
expression
as
to
both
public
employees
and
public
contractors.
the
appellant
in
its
briefs
has
not
disputed
the
importance
of
the
objectives
sought
to
be
achieved
by
the
state's
disclosure
requirement.
the
need
for
self-disclosure
as
a
means
of
achieving
the
objective
since
proof
of
collusive
bidding
is
normally
solely
within
the
knowledge
of
the
participants
or
the
responsibility
of
the
public
contractor
to
account
to
the
state
for
his
actions
in
obtaining
and
performing
state
contracts.
and
in
this
case
here
in
the
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
nothing
he
said
could
have
been
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no.
it
was
preceded
by
--
yes,
it
would
be
under
garrity
of
which
--
yes.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
but
of
course
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes.
and
in
the
garrity
case,
this
court
held
as
i
read
it
that
there
is
compulsion
in
a
public
employee
and
that
case
also,
police
officer
had
consequently,
couldn't
be
prosecuted
on
the
basis
of
that
evidence.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
of
course,
if
he
were
in
view
on
some
of
the
questions
of
the
court
that
he
were
asked
to
sign
a
waiver
and
refuse
and
then
what
was
brought
and
requested
to
answer
questions
and
was
directed
to
answer
the
questions.
if
he
refused,
he
would
under
new
york
law
receive
the
counsel
type
of
immunity,
he
couldn't
be
prosecuted
for
that
crime,
where
as
if
he
signed
the
waiver
under
the
garrity
case,
as
i
read
it,
he
can
be
prosecuted
not
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
that
he
gave
or
the
fruits
thereof
but
on
the
basis
of
independent
evidence.
and
the
efficacy
of
such
a
waiver
which
has
been
discussed
earlier
in
the
course
of
the
two
cases
is
that
in
this
very
painting
conspiracy
situation
involving
the
public
housing,
some
of
the
painting
contractors
did
waive
immunity
and
did
testify
as
a
result
of
which
you
had
convictions
after
trials
in
new
york
county
and
as
you
hire
mr.
campbell,
the
alleged
paper
president
of
the
corporation
and
the
corporation
itself
pleaded
guilty
to
conspiracy
in
his
bid
rigging
and
that
was
because
the
efficacy
of
obtaining
testimony
as
a
result
to
the
statute
that
sound
the
consideration
in.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no.
some
of
the
painting
contractors
in
line
with
mr.
justice
brennan
with
what
we
just
said.
some
of
the
painting
contractors
when
called
before
the
grand
jury
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
did
testify.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
they
were
not
prosecuted
but
that
testimony
was
used
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
right.
and
of
course
they
--
and
i
say
this.
they
testify
that
as
i
understand
that
in
the
bidding
practices,
bids
were
selected
by
roads
and
it
was
agreed
that
advances
though
would
be
the
low
bidder.
as
my
associate
here
pointed
out
to
the
court,
every
such
public
contractor
as
the
appellant
executes
an
affidavit
of
non-collusive
practices
before
obtaining
the
contract.
thus,
apart
from
the
statute
of
being
--
apart
from
the
statute
that's
under
consideration
by
this
court,
we
maintain
that
its
officers
were
under
a
duty
to
furnish
the
appropriate
information
to
the
state
or
its
investigating
agencies
when
called
upon.
the
statute
did
not
create
such
a
duty.
it
provided
that
when
the
refusal
to
furnish
the
information
as
to
the
securing
and
performance
of
contracts
--
public
contracts
as
before
a
grand
jury,
the
contractor
would
be
disqualified
for
five
years
and
it
is
this
disqualification
not
the
cancellation
justice
marshall,
it's
the
disqualification
that's
under
consideration
in
this
case
and
not
the
cancellation
as
i
understand.
the
five
years
is
the
same
period
of
disqualification
which
was
involved
in
the
case
of
a
public
officer
under
article
i
section
6
of
the
state
constitution,
and
in
drafting
the
statute,
we
and
the
attorney
general's
office
used
the
article
i
section
6
as
a
prototype
on
what
to
put
in
to
the
proposed
legislation.
the
conference
of
the
legislature
that
the
grand
jury
would
not
act
capriciously
in
calling
upon
public
contractors
or
their
officers
to
furnish
such
relevant
information
is
the
reason
why
the
particular
section
provides
for
waiver
of
immunity
before
the
grand
jury.
the
grand
jury
is
the
young,
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york.
it
has
fads
or
fantasies
and
it
has
no
leanings
in
any
direction.
and
as
a
protection
to
the
public
contractor,
the
statute
provides
that
only
in
the
case
of
refusal
to
waive
immunity
before
the
grand
jury,
may
the
contractor
be
disqualified.
appellants
rely
upon
garrity
and
spevack.
and
they
maintain
that
regardless
of
the
above
considerations,
this
court
has
already
determined
that
the
objective
cannot
be
constitutionally
achieved
and
that
state
and
its
subdivisions
must
by
force
or
continue
to
pay
from
the
public
treasury
corporate
contractors
whose
officers
refuse
to
disclose
facts
relating
to
the
securing
and
execution
of
the
public
contracts.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
gardner
and
in
the
present
case
and
the
three-judge
court
in
a
case
that
has
to
follow
here,
the
sanitation
employees
case
has
read
garrity
and
spevack
as
not
affecting
the
state's
responsibilities
to
secure
necessary
and
relevant
information
from
public
employees
and
public
contractors.
even
before
spevack,
some
state
courts
justice
fortas
in
florida
and
illinois
simply
differentiated
the
attorney
from
the
public
employee.
i'm
referring
to
two
cases
shiner
against
the
state
in
florida
82
southern
second
57
and
in
re
harlan
in
illinois,
36
northeast
and
second
545,
they
contrasted
the
general
duty
of
an
attorney
to
aid
in
investigating
with
the
specific
duty
of
public
employees
in
that
case
such
as
police
officers
to
furnish
information
and
in
the
spevack
case,
the
disbarment
of
the
attorney
of
course
puts
him
out
of
business
besides
the
reputation
--
detriment
to
his
reputation.
the
public
contractors
involved
here
simply
lose
its
part
of
his
public
business.
here,
the
appellant
said
in
its
petition
and
repeated
on
in
his
argument
that
he
lost
15%
of
his
business
by
a
reason
of
the
disqualification.
the
garrity
case
too
does
not
appear
to
be
helpful
to
the
appellant
as
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
the
person
executing
to
limited
labor
immunity
nevertheless
obtains
constitutional
immunity.
thus,
if
the
officer
here
had
executed
to
waiver
as
i
said
before,
he
could
not
be
prosecuted
upon
the
evidence
secured
by
his
testimony
or
by
any
fruits.
such
immunity
is
coextensive
with
the
waiver
of
the
privilege.
appellant
recognizing
in
its
reply
brief
and
then
an
exchange
for
immunity
for
such
prosecution,
the
witness
would
be
under
the
duty
to
testify,
contends
that
the
state
was
required
to
offer
the
witness
more
complete
the
immunity
for
many
criminal
prosecution
even
derive
from
testimony
unrelated
to
any
evidence
given
by
the
witness
or
leads
obtained
thereby.
thus,
the
issue
oppose
by
the
appellant
is
a
very
narrow
one
as
opposed
the
witness
would
be
required
to
testify
despite
disadvantages.
the
only
dispute
presented
by
the
reply
brief
is
whether
garrity
means
that
the
witness
thereby
obtains
complete
immunity
under
the
counselman
case
or
the
limited
immunity
exemplified
by
the
murphy
case
and
held
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
(inaudible)
and
in
leno.
i
see
nothing
in
the
reply
brief
which
contends
that
in
addition
to
this
promise
of
immunity
of
one
category
or
another,
immunity
must
also
be
given
from
other
sanctions
such
as
the
disqualification
from
a
contract.
the
disqualification
imposed
here
is
imposed
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
requirements
of
due
process,
the
contract
and
those
by
statute
and
by
contract
that
testimony
of
officers
maybe
required.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
disqualification
is
or
would
be
justified
may
be
raised
by
the
contractor
as
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
in
the
specific
statutory
provisions
which
are
adversary
read.
appellant
in
his
reply
brief
acknowledges
this
and
states
that
it
has
deliberately
refused
to
avail
itself
of
this
proceeding.
thus,
this
case
is
distinguishable
also
from
spevack
because
the
contractor
here
has
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
the
reasons
for
the
refusal
to
testify
and
in
this
very
case
had
the
corporation
presented
to
the
court
in
a
proceeding
under
the
section
to
which
i
have
referred
the
fact
that
this
was
a
former
officer
and
that
he
had
resigned
in
good
faith
if
these
were
the
case
that
he
had
no
longer
had
any
interest
in
the
corporation.
if
this
were
the
case
that
he
was
not
in
league
with
the
other
officers
of
the
corporation
of
this
very
case,
i'm
sure
that
the
court
acting
under
that
section
would
have
eliminated
the
disqualification
but
the
appellant
was
in
no
position
to
do
that
because
the
only
office
who
refuse
to
waive
immunity,
signed
a
limited
waiver
of
immunity
was
george
campbell,
the
president
and
as
you
heard,
he
was
the
one
who's
subsequently
was
convicted
of
pleaded
guilty
to
a
conspiracy
for
bid
rigging
so
he
knew
in
advance
and
i'm
sure
the
corporation
knew
because
it
also
pleaded
guilty
that
this
was
one
officer
who
could
not
testify
because
he
had
information
in
his
possession.

the
points
that
i
intend
to
make
the
duty
of
the
public
contractor
to
furnish
information
as
to
the
securing
and
the
execution
of

contracts
which
is
even
more
than
but
at

equal
to
to

of

secondly,
the
expressed
waiver
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
the
contract
executed
pursuant
to
the
statute
and
the
lack
of
ability
of
the
appellant
corporation
to
challenge
the
requirement
for
a
limited
waiver
of
immunity
of
its
officers
which
it
undertook
in

public
contractor
to
account
to
the
state
for
his
actions
in
obtaining
and
performing
state
contracts.
and
in
this
case
here
in
the
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
nothing
he
said
could
have
been
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no.
it
was
preceded
by
--
yes,
it
would
be
under
garrity
of
which
--
yes.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
but
of
course
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes.
and
in
the
garrity
case,
this
court
held
as
i
read
it
that
there
is
compulsion
in
a
public
employee
and
that
case
also,
police
officer
had
consequently,
couldn't
be
prosecuted
on
the
basis
of
that
evidence.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
of
course,
if
he
were
in
view
on
some
of
the
questions
of
the
court
that
he
were
asked
to
sign
a
waiver
and
refuse
and
then
what
was
brought
and
requested
to
answer
questions
and
was
directed
to
answer
the
questions.
if
he
refused,
he
would
under
new
york
law
receive
the
counsel
type
of
immunity,
he
couldn't
be
prosecuted
for
that
crime,
where
as
if
he
signed
the
waiver
under
the
garrity
case,
as
i
read
it,
he
can
be
prosecuted
not
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
that
he
gave
or
the
fruits
thereof
but
on
the
basis
of
independent
evidence.
and
the
efficacy
of
such
a
waiver
which
has
been
discussed
earlier
in
the
course
of
the
two
cases
is
that
in
this
very
painting
conspiracy
situation
involving
the
public
housing,
some
of
the
painting
contractors
did
waive
immunity
and
did
testify
as
a
result
of
which
you
had
convictions
after
trials
in
new
york
county
and
as
you
hire
mr.
campbell,
the
alleged
paper
president
of
the
corporation
and
the
corporation
itself
pleaded
guilty
to
conspiracy
in
his
bid
rigging
and
that
was
because
the
efficacy
of
obtaining
testimony
as
a
result
to
the
statute
that
sound
the
consideration
in.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no.
some
of
the
painting
contractors
in
line
with
mr.
justice
brennan
with
what
we
just
said.
some
of
the
painting
contractors
when
called
before
the
grand
jury
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
did
testify.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
they
were
not
prosecuted
but
that
testimony
was
used
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
right.
and
of
course
they
--
and
i
say
this.
they
testify
that
as
i
understand
that
in
the
bidding
practices,
bids
were
selected
by
roads
and
it
was
agreed
that
advances
though
would
be
the
low
bidder.
as
my
associate
here
pointed
out
to
the
court,
every
such
public
contractor
as
the
appellant
executes
an
affidavit
of
non-collusive
practices
before
obtaining
the
contract.
thus,
apart
from
the
statute
of
being
--
apart
from
the
statute
that's
under
consideration
by
this
court,
we
maintain
that
its
officers
were
under
a
duty
to
furnish
the
appropriate
information
to
the
state
or
its
investigating
agencies
when
called
upon.
the
statute
did
not
create
such
a
duty.
it
provided
that
when
the
refusal
to
furnish
the
information
as
to
the
securing
and
performance
of
contracts
--
public
contracts
as
before
a
grand
jury,
the
contractor
would
be
disqualified
for
five
years
and
it
is
this
disqualification
not
the
cancellation
justice
marshall,
it's
the
disqualification
that's
under
consideration
in
this
case
and
not
the
cancellation
as
i
understand.
the
five
years
is
the
same
period
of
disqualification
which
was
involved
in
the
case
of
a
public
officer
under
article
i
section
6
of
the
state
constitution,
and
in
drafting
the
statute,
we
and
the
attorney
general's
office
used
the
article
i
section
6
as
a
prototype
on
what
to
put
in
to
the
proposed
legislation.
the
conference
of
the
legislature
that
the
grand
jury
would
not
act
capriciously
in
calling
upon
public
contractors
or
their
officers
to
furnish
such
relevant
information
is
the
reason
why
the
particular
section
provides
for
waiver
of
immunity
before
the
grand
jury.
the
grand
jury
is
the
young,
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york.
it
has
fads
or
fantasies
and
it
has
no
leanings
in
any
direction.
and
as
a
protection
to
the
public
contractor,
the
statute
provides
that
only
in
the
case
of
refusal
to
waive
immunity
before
the
grand
jury,
may
the
contractor
be
disqualified.
appellants
rely
upon
garrity
and
spevack.
and
they
maintain
that
regardless
of
the
above
considerations,
this
court
has
already
determined
that
the
objective
cannot
be
constitutionally
achieved
and
that
state
and
its
subdivisions
must
by
force
or
continue
to
pay
from
the
public
treasury
corporate
contractors
whose
officers
refuse
to
disclose
facts
relating
to
the
securing
and
execution
of
the
public
contracts.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
gardner
and
in
the
present
case
and
the
three-judge
court
in
a
case
that
has
to
follow
here,
the
sanitation
employees
case
has
read
garrity
and
spevack
as
not
affecting
the
state's
responsibilities
to
secure
necessary
and
relevant
information
from
public
employees
and
public
contractors.
even
before
spevack,
some
state
courts
justice
fortas
in
florida
and
illinois
simply
differentiated
the
attorney
from
the
public
employee.
i'm
referring
to
two
cases
shiner
against
the
state
in
florida
82
southern
second
57
and
in
re
harlan
in
illinois,
36
northeast
and
second
545,
they
contrasted
the
general
duty
of
an
attorney
to
aid
in
investigating
with
the
specific
duty
of
public
employees
in
that
case
such
as
police
officers
to
furnish
information
and
in
the
spevack
case,
the
disbarment
of
the
attorney
of
course
puts
him
out
of
business
besides
the
reputation
--
detriment
to
his
reputation.
the
public
contractors
involved
here
simply
lose
its
part
of
his
public
business.
here,
the
appellant
said
in
its
petition
and
repeated
on
in
his
argument
that
he
lost
15%
of
his
business
by
a
reason
of
the
disqualification.
the
garrity
case
too
does
not
appear
to
be
helpful
to
the
appellant
as
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
the
person
executing
to
limited
labor
immunity
nevertheless
obtains
constitutional
immunity.
thus,
if
the
officer
here
had
executed
to
waiver
as
i
said
before,
he
could
not
be
prosecuted
upon
the
evidence
secured
by
his
testimony
or
by
any
fruits.
such
immunity
is
coextensive
with
the
waiver
of
the
privilege.
appellant
recognizing
in
its
reply
brief
and
then
an
exchange
for
immunity
for
such
prosecution,
the
witness
would
be
under
the
duty
to
testify,
contends
that
the
state
was
required
to
offer
the
witness
more
complete
the
immunity
for
many
criminal
prosecution
even
derive
from
testimony
unrelated
to
any
evidence
given
by
the
witness
or
leads
obtained
thereby.
thus,
the
issue
oppose
by
the
appellant
is
a
very
narrow
one
as
opposed
the
witness
would
be
required
to
testify
despite
disadvantages.
the
only
dispute
presented
by
the
reply
brief
is
whether
garrity
means
that
the
witness
thereby
obtains
complete
immunity
under
the
counselman
case
or
the
limited
immunity
exemplified
by
the
murphy
case
and
held
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
(inaudible)
and
in
leno.
i
see
nothing
in
the
reply
brief
which
contends
that
in
addition
to
this
promise
of
immunity
of
one
category
or
another,
immunity
must
also
be
given
from
other
sanctions
such
as
the
disqualification
from
a
contract.
the
disqualification
imposed
here
is
imposed
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
requirements
of
due
process,
the
contract
and
those
by
statute
and
by
contract
that
testimony
of
officers
maybe
required.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
disqualification
is
or
would
be
justified
may
be
raised
by
the
contractor
as
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
in
the
specific
statutory
provisions
which
are
adversary
read.
appellant
in
his
reply
brief
acknowledges
this
and
states
that
it
has
deliberately
refused
to
avail
itself
of
this
proceeding.
thus,
this
case
is
distinguishable
also
from
spevack
because
the
contractor
here
has
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
the
reasons
for
the
refusal
to
testify
and
in
this
very
case
had
the
corporation
presented
to
the
court
in
a
proceeding
under
the
section
to
which
i
have
referred
the
fact
that
this
was
a
former
officer
and
that
he
had
resigned
in
good
faith
if
these
were
the
case
that
he
had
no
longer
had
any
interest
in
the
corporation.
if
this
were
the
case
that
he
was
not
in
league
with
the
other
officers
of
the
corporation
of
this
very
case,
i'm
sure
that
the
court
acting
under
that
section
would
have
eliminated
the
disqualification
but
the
appellant
was
in
no
position
to
do
that
because
the
only
office
who
refuse
to
waive
immunity,
signed
a
limited
waiver
of
immunity
was
george
campbell,
the
president
and
as
you
heard,
he
was
the
one
who's
subsequently
was
convicted
of
pleaded
guilty
to
a
conspiracy
for
bid
rigging
so
he
knew
in
advance
and
i'm
sure
the
corporation
knew
because
it
also
pleaded
guilty
that
this
was
one
officer
who
could
not
testify
because
he
had
information
in
his
possession.
