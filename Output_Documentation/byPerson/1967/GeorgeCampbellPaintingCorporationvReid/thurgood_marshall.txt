mr.
hessel,
suppose
this
man
who
signed
the
contract,
the
young
man?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
in
the
meantime,
he'd
been
arrested
and
convicted
of
rigging
bids,
fraud,
etcetera
in
regard
to
another
corporation.
could
you
cancel
the
contract
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh!
but
the
same
president.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
have
talking
about
canceling
this
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
couldn't
do
it,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you're
really
not
interested
in
the
people
in
dealing
with
good,
clean
people
are
you,
because
he
had
been
doing
business
with
a
convicted
criminal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
could
you
just
qualify
him
for
the
future?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
that
this
man
had
been
convicted
and
it
subsequently
resigned?
i
would
assume
he
would
resign
that
that
you
would
disqualify
in
the
coming
five
years?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
before
you
get
to
judicial
intervention
at
least
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
you
have
to
get
to
a
little
due
process
hearing.
