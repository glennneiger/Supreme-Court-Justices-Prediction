mr.
albert
a.
blinder
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
like
the
one
just
argued
before
it
is
on
appeal
from
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
from
a
decision
rendered
the
very
same
day
as
gardner
against
broderick.
in
its
opinion,
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
declined
that
the
statute
in
this
case
which
is
section
2701
of
the
new
york
public
authorities
law
was
constitutional
and
based
its
finding
upon
the
decision
in
gardner
against
broderick.
now,
the
statute
in
question
which
is
also
identical
with
several
other
statutes
in
new
york
such
103
of
the
municipal
law
and
a
section
of
the
finance
law,
provides
similarly
that
if
a
person
is
called
before
a
grand
jury
concerning
a
transaction
or
contracts
with
--
that
states
any
political
subdivision
thereof,
a
public
authority
or
with
any
public
department,
agency
or
official
of
the
state
or
if
any
political
subdivision
thereof
or
of
a
public
authority
and
refuses
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
or
refuses
to
answer
any
relevant
question
then
such
person
or
any
firm,
partnership
or
corporation
of
which
he
is
a
member,
partner,
director
or
officer
shall
be
disqualified
for
a
period
of
five
years
from
biding
on
contract
or
from
doing
business
with
the
state
and
also
any
existing
contracts
at
the
time
may
be
cancelled
or
terminated.
in
this
situation,
we
are
presented
with
the
question
as
to
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
offended
by
the
public
authority's
law
because
of
the
requirement
that
a
corporation
be
disqualified
when
one
of
its
officers
or
directors
asserts
or
refuses
the
way
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
as
a
corollary
of
that,
whether
the
resignation
and
surrender
of
control
by
such
an
officer
or
a
director
prior
to
being
called
before
a
grand
jury,
makes
automatic
application
of
the
statute
repugnant
to
the
due
process
clause.
we
also
have
the
question
as
to
whether
a
direction
by
statute
that
all
public
contracts
contain
an
agreement
to
waive
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
an
unconstitutional
condition
of
doing
business
with
the
state.
now,
the
facts
in
this
situation
are
somewhat
different
than
the
gardner
against
broderick
case
previously.
in
fact,
the
appellants
which
is
a
corporation
was
disqualified
from
doing
business
with
the
state
for
a
five
year
period
and
its
contracts
were
terminated
because
one
of
its
former
officers
have
refused
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
when
subpoenaed
before
a
grand
jury.
in
fact,
the
individual
in
question
was
the
president
and
a
director
of
the
corporation
until
about
three
weeks
before
he
was
subpoenaed
before
the
grand
jury.
while
the
corporation
bears
the
same
name
as
the
individual
in
question,
he
is
the
son
of
the
founder,
he
was
24
years
of
age
at
the
time
that
he
was
subpoenaed
and
was
not
in
actual
control
of
the
corporation.
he
was
the
(inaudible)
i
had
because
he
was
the
heir
of
power
to
his
deceased
father.
about
three
weeks
after
resigning
his
officers
and
giving
up
his
stock
which
was
10%
of
the
outstanding
stock
of
the
corporation,
he
was
subpoenaed
before
a
grand
jury.
the
following
day,
he
appeared,
refused
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
and
the
corporation
a
week
later
was
notified
by
the
new
york
city
housing
authority
that
its
contracts
were
terminated
and
that
the
appellants
was
disqualified.
i
might
add
that
before
the
subpoena
was
served
upon
him,
the
corporation
notified
the
appellees
that
in
fact
he
had
relinquished
his
officers
and
was
no
longer
the
president
and
director
of
the
corporation.
when
he
appeared
before
this
grand
jury
pursuant
to
subpoena,
he
was
never
asked
the
question
and
never
refused
to
make
any
answers.
in
fact,
all
of
the
other
officers
and
directors
who
were
subpoenaed
before
this
grand
jury,
signed
waivers
of
immunity,
some
were
called
in
to
testify
and
did
testify,
some
were
not
called
in
to
testify.
two
days
after
the
letter
of
disqualification
was
sent
out
by
the
city
housing
authority,
the
appellant
corporation
requested
a
hearing
as
to
its
disqualification.
that
letter
was
ignored.
four
days
later,
a
telegram
was
sent
by
the
appellant's
corporation
also
to
the
city
housing
authority,
requesting
a
hearing.
two
weeks
thereafter,
a
letter
was
sent
by
the
city
housing
authority
to
the
appellant
corporation,
advising
the
corporation
that
it
could
not
have
a
hearing
and
that
it
need
not
bother
communicating
with
the
housing
authority
again
about
this
subject.
i'm
unable
to
advice
the
court
as
to
the
content
of
the
waiver
of
immunity
which
was
offered
to
the
individual
in
question.
the
grand
jury
being
a
secret
proceeding,
we
were
not
acquainted
with
its
contents.
we
assume
it
was
a
general
waiver
of
immunity
and
we
have
not
seen
any
transcript
of
testimony
concerning
the
questioning
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
of
the
individual,
asking
him
to
sign
the
waiver
of
immunity.
the
letter
which
advised
the
appellant
corporation
that
it
was
disqualified
said
and
this
is
the
only
way
we
know
it
that
the
grand
jury
in
addition
to
investigating
alleged
bid
rigging
was
only
investigating
bribery
of
the
labor
official,
extortion,
coercion,
assault
and
conspiracy
of
each
of
these
other
things.
now,
our
argument
of
course
is
based
on
much
of
what
was
discussed
in
the
gardner
argument.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
the
order
of
disqualification
is
against
the
appellant
corporation.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
there's
an
automatic
disqualification
of
the
individual,
pursuant
to
the
statute
and
he
also
was
disqualified
but
this
proceeding
was
commenced
only
by
the
corporation.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
yes,
he
resigned
before
he
was
subpoenaed.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
that's
precisely
what
the
letter
said
that
because
of
his
refusal
--
because
of
the
former
president's
refusal
to
sign
the
waiver
of
immunity,
the
corporation
was
disqualified.
there
was
no
administrative
hearing
despite
the
fact
that
one
was
requested
and
there
were
no
questions
put
to
the
former
president
when
he
appeared
at
the
grand
jury
room.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
i
think
that's
considerable.
well,
may
i
say
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
state
law
will
approve
it,
yes!
i
believe,
however,
that
this
is
repugnant
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
to
the
privileges
of
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
i
agree
as
to
that
sir.
we're
not
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
no.
actually
sir,
what
we're
complaining
about
is
that
a
penalty
was
imposed
upon
the
corporation
in
a
manner
which
is
repugnant
to
the
due
process
clause
because
of
a
statute
which
imposed
the
penalty
upon
an
individual
contrary
to
spevack
against
klein.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well
actually,
we're
making
both
this
lock
out
point
and
the
point
in
spevack.
we
state
that
vicarious
disqualification
is
based
upon
an
unconstitutional
section
of
law.
and
it's
rendered
unconstitutional
not
only
by
spevack
but
also
by
virtue
of
slochower
because
we
were
afforded
no
rights
at
all
to
make
explanation.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
if
we
have
the
administrative
hearing
mr.
justice
black,
i
believe
that
we
could
have
found
out
whether
the
waiver
of
immunity
that
was
offered
to
the
former
officer
was
a
legal
one
and
we
would
have
been
able
to
determine
at
least
what
the
colloquy
had
been
between
the
assistant
district
attorney
and
the
officer
in
question
concerning
whether
this
grand
jury
was
operating
within
the
scope
of
the
statute.
we
don't
even
know
that
so
that
under
the
circumstances,
we
not
only
state
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
but
certainly
its
application
as
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
said
it
was
valid.it's
repugnant
to
due
process
and
the
slochower.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
we
would
be
making
the
same
argument,
yes,
certainly
in
connection
with
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
yes,
our
position
on
that
is
simply
that
even
under
spevack
and
mr.
justice
fortas'
concurring
opinion
that
this,
a
grand
jury
inquiry
is
not
the
proper
administrative
inquiry
to
determine
the
fitness
and
qualification
of
this
contract.
the
grand
jury
in
new
york
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
i
say
this.
i
believe
that
that
is
an
opening
question
in
spevack.
and
under
the
circumstances,
this
court
might
very
well
find
that
our
people
before
our
proper
administrative
tribunal
have
to
demonstrate
their
fitness
and
qualification
but
we
say
that
the
grand
jury
was
absolutely
the
wrong
tribunal
that
it
never
had
the
functions
of
determining
fitness
and
qualifications
of
a
public
contract.
in
fact
and
i
believe
this
is
set
forth
by
our
brief
with
--
in
some
detail.
the
grand
jury
by
statute
may
only
look
into
criminal
misconduct
of
public
officials
and
when
the
counsel
for
the
appellee
in
the
proceeding
argument
said
that
the
grand
jury
may
present
on
other
than
criminal
matters,
he
was
not
quite
stating
accurately
the
law
of
new
york
state.
the
lore
of
new
york
state
as
it
is
clearly
set
out
in
the
code
of
criminal
procedure.
it
says
that
in
the
cause
of
examining
into
whether
there
was
criminal
misconduct,
if
it
finds
that
there
was
non-criminal
misconduct
of
public
officials
that
at
the
discretion
of
the
court,
it
may
make
a
recommendation
concerning
this
non-criminal
misconduct
of
public
officials
but
there
again,
if
it
does
make
such
a
recommendation,
the
public
official
who
was
so
charged
has
the
right
within
31
days
to
file
an
asset
to
the
presentment
of
the
grand
jury
before
that
presentment
can
be
made
public.
and
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
i
believe
that's
certainly
one
of
the
points.
the
other
points
has
to
do
with
the
slochower
question
as
to
his
resignation
whether
in
fact
any
administrative
hearing
was
given
and
i
can't
say
that
it's
strictly
that
because
we
have
also
made
the
other
point.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
yes,
under
the
public
authorities
law
at
a
later
time,
section
2303
was
added
--
2603,
i
beg
your
pardon.
and
under
that
section,
a
corporation
after
its
disqualification
may
commence
a
proceeding,
establishing
one
that
there
was
cooperation
by
the
corporation
afterwards,
and
two,
that
the
person
who
was
the
recalcitrant
witness
so
to
speak,
had
not
actually
been
a
control
person
than
the
court
might
in
a
discretionary
fashion
remove
the
disqualification
if
it
was
in
the
public
interest
to
so
remove.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
yes,
it
does.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
the
stock
is
held
as
follows.
the
resigned
officer
had
10%
of
the
stock.
his
brothers
and
sisters
had
an
additional
40%
of
the
stock.
50%
of
the
stock
was
owned
by
the
estate
of
his
late
father
of
which
his
mother
was
one
of
the
principal
beneficiaries.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
there
is
no
publicly
held
stock.
this
is
a
closely
held
private
corporation.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
i
believe
this
court
has
held
in
united
states
against
white
that
the
privilege
cannot
be
used
by
a
corporation.
and
i
would
assume
that
in
following
it
through
to
the
state
of
facts
you've
mentioned
that
the
corporation
could
not
object
providing
that
it
met
that
competency
and
relevancy
and
materiality
test
of
evidence.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
yes.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
as
well
as
the
individual.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
it
is
a
problem
and
in
our
reply
brief,
we
explained
it
as
follows.
i'm
not
certain
that
the
explanation
is
sufficient
to
convince
you
sir
but
we
have
said
that
the
corporation
is
not
in
effect,
asserting
the
fifth
amendment.
the
corporation
is
asserting
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
that
as
a
result
of
an
illegal
penalty
that's
based
upon
an
individual
--
is
having
asserted
the
fifth
amendment,
the
corporation
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
being
deprived
of
its
property
without
due
process.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
i
must
say
that
i
think
what
you
say
is
correct
and
i
believe
that
it
is
basically
unfair
for
the
corporation
not
to
be
able
under
the
same
set
of
circumstances
as
i've
argued
to
assert
that
privilege.
however,
i
do
understand
that
this
court
has
ruled
with
in
contrary
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
basically
since
we're
talking
about
a
civil
penalty
which
was
vicariously
imposed
without
even
the
right
of
the
corporation
to
have
a
rudimentary
hearing,
i
say
that
that
is
repugnant
to
due
process.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
oh
yes.
we've
--
the
corporation
turned
over
all
its
records
and
the
other
officers
and
directors
all
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
and
waived
immunity.
in
addition
to
which
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
a
week
later.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
no,
before
it
was
disqualified.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
excuse
me
your
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
we
merely
ask
for
a
hearing.
the
hearing
did
not
specify
who
would
be
called
i
think
could
determine
on
the
nature
of
the
hearing
which
the
appellees
would
have
called.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice
that
that
question
was
left
open
in
the
spevack
decision
and
i
--
i
maintain
sir
that
even
if
that
right
--
well,
may
i
put
it
this
way.
even
if
these
were
the
case
that
he
could
have
been
called
before
a
disciplinary
hearing
appropriately
set
up
by
the
city
housing
authority
and
had
refused
to
testify,
it
is
entirely
possible
that
he
--
that
the
corporation
and
he
could
have
been
fired
without
changing
this
case
which
we're
arguing
at
the
moment.
i
--
my
point
is
that
the
grand
jury
is
not
a
disciplinary
proceeding
and
in
fact,
there
was
no
hearing
given
and
they
--
the
matter
of
the
fitness
and
qualification
of
the
individual
officer
as
well
as
the
corporation
was
never
put
in
issue.
if
in
fact,
that
had
been
put
in
issue
before
an
administrative
tribunal
then
i
do
not
know
what
the
answer
would
be
because
it
would
depend
very
much
on
whether
this
court
decides
that
the
fifth
amendment
under
malloy
and
hogan
and
spevack
covers
disciplinary
hearings
of
public
officials
as
well
as
public
contractors.
i
say
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
this
court
to
go
that
far
in
seeing
the
basic
unfairness
of
the
situation
which
resulted
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
the
record
reveals
that
when
counsel
first
hear
that
this
investigation
was
being
conducted
by
the
district
attorney's
office
and
that
there
was
a
possibility
that
subpoenas
might
be
served
upon
officers
of
the
corporation.
they
held
a
meeting
with
the
officers
and
directors
and
advise
them
that
this
might
happen
and
that
if
anyone
of
them
would
waive
--
would
refuse
to
waive
immunity,
he
had
best
get
out
of
the
corporation
as
an
officer
and
director
in
stockholding
and
the
only
one
who
said
that
for
personal
reasons
he
might
do
this
was
george
campbell,
jr.
and
that
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
it
was
to
the
corporation's
interest
to
have
them
all
waive
the
immunity
so
that
the
corporation
wouldn't
be
disqualified
if
and
when
they
were
subpoenaed.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
essentially,
that
is
correct.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
yes
sir.
but
this
was
a
private
corporation
and
i
say
that
while
the
state
has
the
burden
of
being
sure
that
its
contractual
obligations
do
not
violate
the
basic
bill
of
rights
when
a
person's
family
corporation
says
to
the
contrary,
it
might
be
an
entirely
different
picture.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
the
letter
--
the
record
does
indicate
that
the
grand
jury
was
investigating
bid
rigging,
bribery
of
the
labor
official,
extortion,
coercion
and
assault
and
a
conspiracy
to
commit
any
of
those
substantive
crimes.
and
i
must
argue
to
the
court
that
certainly,
within
the
realm
of
a
transaction
and
a
contract
with
the
state,
i
can
imagine
how
a
grand
jury
can
determine
the
issue
as
to
whether
an
assault
bears
upon
the
contractual
obligation
of
the
contractor
or
upon
his
fitness
or
qualification.
now,
i
respectfully
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
i
think
it
might
very
well
mr.
chief
justice
but
they
never
informed
you
--
the
corporation
or
the
client
who
was
the
alleged
recalcitrant
witness
just
what
the
circumstances
of
whether
they
were
investigating.
in
fact,
under
the
statute,
they
do
not
have
to
confine
the
grand
jury
investigation
to
only
the
contracts
in
question.
under
the
statute,
they
can
look
into
any
transaction
with
any
political
subdivision
or
any
public
official
and
i
assume
in
this
case
they
could
even
ask
questions
concerning
whether
his
taxes
were
paid,
whether
the
streets
were
properly
paid
outside
of
his
house
assuming
he
had
an
obligation
to
do
so
and
they
could
probably
ask
questions
which
not
in
the
least
could
affect
his
fitness
and
qualification
as
a
public
contractor
with
the
new
york
city
housing
authority.
so
all
i
can
say
on
this
is
that
without
specifically
being
advised
of
the
nature
of
the
inquiry
and
that
they
were
looking
into
the
contracts
which
were
allegedly
the
ones
in
question.
the
individual
would
be
waiving
immunity
as
to
all
kinds
of
remote
things
which
couldn't
possibly
bear
upon
fitness
and
qualification
and
therefore,
carrying
at
once
that
further,
the
corporation
could
in
turn
be
penalized
by
an
inquiry
that
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
its
function
as
a
public
contract.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
no.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
that's
correct
sir.
also,
i
might
add
that
the
individual
himself
was
disqualified
but
of
course
we're
obviously
not
raising
that
question.
we
say
that
the
corporation
despite
all
of
its
intents
to
cooperate
and
comply
in
every
respect
possible
was
vicariously
disqualified
because
of
an
unconstitutional
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
may
i
just
state
this.
they
never
asked
the
corporation
about
any
of
these
things
and
have
they
done
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
they
were
called.
yes.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
that's
correct.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
that's
correct
but
nothing
specific
was
asked
by
the
city
housing
authority.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
except
if
it
wasn't
the
city
housing
authority
conducting
the
grand
jury.
it
was
in
assistant
district
attorney
and
i'm
sure
he
wasn't
under
the
--
under
the
laws
of
new
york
allowed
to
divulge
what
happened
to
the
city
housing
authority
and
certainly,
it's
their
duty
to
determine
fitness
and
qualification
and
i
don't
believe
that
they
were
ever
able
to
find
out
because
there
is
a
strict
rule
of
secrecy
in
new
york
concerning
grand
juries
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
divulge
the
testimony
before
it.
and
under
the
circumstances,
if
the
city
housing
authority
wanted
to
find
out
something
about
this
corporation,
i
say
that
the
only
way
they
could
find
out
is
by
asking
the
corporation
because
the
grand
jury
wasn't
allowed
to
give
it
to
them
and
always
the
assistant
district
attorney
without
a
court
order.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
what
happened
was,
the
assistant
district
attorney
notified
the
city
housing
authority
that
george
campbell,
jr.
had
refused
to
waive.
they
in
turn
wrote
a
letter
to
the
corporation,
telling
the
corporation
that
based
upon
the
letter
from
the
assistant
district
attorney
informing
them
that
the
individual
had
refused
to
waive,
they
were
disqualifying
the
corporation.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
the
city
housing
authority.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
--
who
are
the
appellees.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
we
then
filed
the
necessary
--
well,
number
one,
we
asked
for
a
hearing
which
was
denied.
number
two,
we
filed
an
article
78
proceeding
which
is
a
special
proceeding
in
new
york
in
the
nature
of
the
review.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
a
judicial
review.
and
we
were
informed
by
opinion
that
we
were
in
the
wrong
remedy
that
we
should
start
a
plenary
action.
we
started
a
plenary
action
and
as
part
of
that
move
for
a
temporary
injunction.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
yes.
they're
both
in
this
case
sir.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
we
move
for
a
temporary
injunction
requesting
the
disqualification
be
held
up
pending
the
outcome
of
the
plenary
action
and
that
was
stayed
because
we
were
appealing
the
article
78
proceeding
and
then
the
appellant
division
of
the
new
york
supreme
court,
dismissed
both
claiming
that
we
were
obligated
to
stand
on
our
contracts
and
we
have
no
right
to
test
any
further.
we
then
went
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
the
contract
provided
in
advance
that
if
any
officer
or
director
of
the
corporation
were
called
before
a
grand
jury
and
this
is
the
statutory
language
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
in
the
contract.
that
if
any
--
if
any
officer
or
director
were
called
and
refused
to
waive
that
the
contracts
will
be
terminated
and
that
the
contractor
would
be
disqualified
for
five
years.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
yes,
we
did
sir.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
there
are
two
questions
because
the
statute
contains
one
section
which
puts
it
into
the
contract
and
another
section
which
operates
separate
from
the
contract
and
we
have
argued
that
both
are
unconstitutional.
the
first,
because
the
state
may
not
impose
an
unconstitutional
provision
in
its
contracts
and
the
other
based
upon
the
fact
that
this
is
interrogation
of
spevack
and
also
slochower
because
of
the
due
process.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
that's
correct
sir.
the
statute
mandates
that
every
public
contract
don't
have
that
provision
in
it
and
we
say
that
the
statutory
direction
is
unconstitutional
because
it
requires
an
unconstitutional
provision
to
be
put
into
a
public
contract.
and
with
respect
to
the
--
to
the
letter,
may
i
just
call
to
your
attention
sir
the
dissenting
opinion
in
reagan
against
new
york
in
which
your
honor
joined
in
which
mr.
justice
douglas
said,
"so
far
as
i
know,
it
has
never
been
held
before
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
or
any
other
bill
of
rights
safeguard
can
be
bargained
away
far
in
advance
of
the
day
when
needed
as
protection
against
the
overreaching
power
of
government."
we
state
that
under
the
entire
line
of
unconstitutional
provisions
of
public
contracts
that
the
state
may
not
put
this
provision
into
a
public
contract
and
cause
the
contract
thereby
to
agree
to
unconstitutional
provision
in
the
contract.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
yes,
it
was
signed
by
the
president.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
yes
sir.
he
signed
three
contracts
in
the
short
period
when
he
was
the
president
which
was
about
seven
months.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
i
believe
i
did.
in
fact,
only
about
15%
of
the
business
of
this
corporation
was
with
this
particular
agency.
but
as
a
result
of
this
disqualification,
this
corporation
was
not
only
disqualified
from
doing
business
with
the
state
of
new
york
but
has
been
unable
to
get
some
contracts
with
other
states
and
with
many
private
companies
because
of
a
general
blacklisting
which
has
occurred
in
the
industry.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
yes,
i
believe.
although,
the
acting
process
case
which
this
court
decided,
indicated
that
whether
there
was
a
violation
with
the
anti-kickback
section,
only
the
one
contact
in
question
was
not
enforceable,
it
didn't
go
any
further
not
saying
a
general
blacklisting
for
a
specific
length
of
time.
now,
if
i
have
any
more
time,
may
reserve
it
for
rebuttal.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
just
have
one
or
two
rebuttal
arguments
which
i
will
try
to
confine
in
just
a
few
moments.
number
one,
with
respect
to
the
irrelevancy
of
the
corporation
having
pleaded
guilty
to
one
count
of
a
misdemeanor,
may
i
just
say
this.
the
plea
of
guilty
that
was
offered
by
the
corporation
appellant
here
was
to
one
count
in
a
multi-count
indictment
that
was
offered
prior
to
the
commencement
of
a
mass
conspiracy
trial
that
lasted
over
three
months.
the
district
attorney
recommended
the
acceptance
of
the
one
misdemeanor
count.
in
fact,
this
was
a
business
decision.
it
would
have
cost
the
corporation
far
more
money
to
a
defendant
on
this
situation
and
then
there's
the
maximum
penalty
on
the
misdemeanor
that
it
pleaded
guilty
to.
it
did
not
plead
guilty
to
all
of
the
other
things
which
my
learned
friends
over
here
mentioned.
i
say
this
is
an
irrelevancy
because
under
the
new
york
state
law
the
fact
that
a
corporation
may
have
pleaded
guilty
does
not
result
in
automatic
disqualification
and
certainly
not
for
a
five
year
period.
the
only
way
this
occurs
is
if
someone
refuses
to
waive
immunity
or
refuses
to
--
or
asserts
his
privilege
against
self
incrimination
and
i
believe
that
that's
the
very
crux
of
the
argument.
now,
as
mr.
justice
fortas
inquired
before,
may
i
just
refer
to
the
learned
court
to
pages
25
and
26
of
our
appellant's
brief
which
contains
the
new
york
state
statutes
and
from
section
2(a)
of
section
253(a),
it
is
obvious
that
the
grand
jury's
power
derives
only
from
the
right
to
investigate
criminal
conduct
and
then
if
in
addition
to
its
investigation
of
criminal
conduct,
it
finds
non-criminal
conduct.
it
may
make
a
report
which
is
still
subject
to
certain
other
conditions
and
the
other
conditions
involve
the
preponderance
of
credible
and
legally
admissible
evidence
and
also,
it
gives
the
officer
an
opportunity
to
reply
before
this
report
can
be
made
public.
in
addition
to
which,
the
report
itself
is
limited
to
reporting
on
public
officers
and
public
employees.
now,
while
this
is
a
contractor
which
may
have
in
one
or
two
aspects
be
doing
certain
work
for
a
public
agency,
certainly,
none
of
the
officers
or
employees
of
this
corporation
would
deem
to
be
public
officers
or
--
or
public
employees
and
under
the
new
york
state
decision
on
the
subject,
i
don't
even
believe
under
this
section
that
a
report
can
be
handed
up
except
to
recommend
the
changes
in
the
law
but
it
cannot
bring
to
the
attention
of
an
administrative
agency
the
misconduct
of
a
public
contractor.
it
is
wholly
without
the
scope
of
the
grand
jury.
now,
with
respect
to
standing,
i
believe
that
the
attorney
general
in
his
brief,
attempted
to
say
that
this
was
a
situation
which
was
not
covered
by
the
pierce
or
by
the
joint
anti-facist
refugee
committee
case.
i
believe,
however,
that
in
an
analysis
of
this,
it
would
have
to
be
an
inescapable
conclusion
that
this
corporation
just
as
the
corporation
in
pierce
was
entitled
to
raise
the
issue
as
to
whether
its
business
or
property
were
taken
away
without
due
process
of
law.
in
addition
to
which
and
this
was
mentioned
by
learned
friend,
mr.
hessel.
in
holland
against
hogan
case
which
is
number
653
in
the
october
term
and
which
is
a
petition
for
certiorari,
the
attorney
general
argued
exactly
the
converse
of
this
situation.
in
that
case,
the
individuals
are
applying
for
certiorari
here
and
he
has
argued
that
it's
the
corporation
that
was
disqualified
and
therefore
the
individuals
have
no
standing,
the
corporation
must
bring
the
suit.
now,
i
submit
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
cannot
have
it
both
ways
either
we
have
standing
here
or
in
the
holland
against
hogan
case
there
is
standing
and
under
the
circumstances
since
we're
dealing
with
exactly
the
same
statute,
may
i
state
that
this
court
should
pass
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
which
i
believe
deprives
the
corporation
not
only
of
due
process
but
its
individual
officers
of
the
guarantees
of
the
fifth
amendment.
thank
you.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
like
the
one
just
argued
before
it
is
on
appeal
from
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
from
a
decision
rendered
the
very
same
day
as
gardner
against
broderick.
in
its
opinion,
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
declined
that
the
statute
in
this
case
which
is
section
2701
of
the
new
york
public
authorities
law
was
constitutional
and
based
its
finding
upon
the
decision
in
gardner
against
broderick.
now,
the
statute
in
question
which
is
also
identical
with
several
other
statutes
in
new
york
such
103
of
the
municipal
law
and
a
section
of
the
finance
law,
provides
similarly
that
if
a
person
is
called
before
a
grand
jury
concerning
a
transaction
or
contracts
with
--
that
states
any
political
subdivision
thereof,
a
public
authority
or
with
any
public
department,
agency
or
official
of
the
state
or
if
any
political
subdivision
thereof
or
of
a
public
authority
and
refuses
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
or
refuses
to
answer
any
relevant
question
then
such
person
or
any
firm,
partnership
or
corporation
of
which
he
is
a
member,
partner,
director
or
officer
shall
be
disqualified
for
a
period
of
five
years
from
biding
on
contract
or
from
doing
business
with
the
state
and
also
any
existing
contracts
at
the
time
may
be
cancelled
or
terminated.
in
this
situation,
we
are
presented
with
the
question
as
to
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
offended
by
the
public
authority's
law
because
of
the
requirement
that
a
corporation
be
disqualified
when
one
of
its
officers
or
directors
asserts
or
refuses
the
way
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
as
a
corollary
of
that,
whether
the
resignation
and
surrender
of
control
by
such
an
officer
or
a
director
prior
to
being
called
before
a
grand
jury,
makes
automatic
application
of
the
statute
repugnant
to
the
due
process
clause.
we
also
have
the
question
as
to
whether
a
direction
by
statute
that
all
public
contracts
contain
an
agreement
to
waive
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
an
unconstitutional
condition
of
doing
business
with
the
state.
now,
the
facts
in
this
situation
are
somewhat
different
than
the
gardner
against
broderick
case
previously.
in
fact,
the
appellants
which
is
a
corporation
was
disqualified
from
doing
business
with
the
state
for
a
five
year
period
and
its
contracts
were
terminated
because
one
of
its
former
officers
have
refused
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
when
subpoenaed
before
a
grand
jury.
in
fact,
the
individual
in
question
was
the
president
and
a
director
of
the
corporation
until
about
three
weeks
before
he
was
subpoenaed
before
the
grand
jury.
while
the
corporation
bears
the
same
name
as
the
individual
in
question,
he
is
the
son
of
the
founder,
he
was
24
years
of
age
at
the
time
that
he
was
subpoenaed
and
was
not
in
actual
control
of
the
corporation.
he
was
the
(inaudible)
i
had
because
he
was
the
heir
of
power
to
his
deceased
father.
about
three
weeks
after
resigning
his
officers
and
giving
up
his
stock
which
was
10%
of
the
outstanding
stock
of
the
corporation,
he
was
subpoenaed
before
a
grand
jury.
the
following
day,
he
appeared,
refused
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
and
the
corporation
a
week
later
was
notified
by
the
new
york
city
housing
authority
that
its
contracts
were
terminated
and
that
the
appellants
was
disqualified.
i
might
add
that
before
the
subpoena
was
served
upon
him,
the
corporation
notified
the
appellees
that
in
fact
he
had
relinquished
his
officers
and
was
no
longer
the
president
and
director
of
the
corporation.
when
he
appeared
before
this
grand
jury
pursuant
to
subpoena,
he
was
never
asked
the
question
and
never
refused
to
make
any
answers.
in
fact,
all
of
the
other
officers
and
directors
who
were
subpoenaed
before
this
grand
jury,
signed
waivers
of
immunity,
some
were
called
in
to
testify
and
did
testify,
some
were
not
called
in
to
testify.
two
days
after
the
letter
of
disqualification
was
sent
out
by
the
city
housing
authority,
the
appellant
corporation
requested
a
hearing
as
to
its
disqualification.
that
letter
was
ignored.
four
days
later,
a
telegram
was
sent
by
the
appellant's
corporation
also
to
the
city
housing
authority,
requesting
a
hearing.
two
weeks
thereafter,
a
letter
was
sent
by
the
city
housing
authority
to
the
appellant
corporation,
advising
the
corporation
that
it
could
not
have
a
hearing
and
that
it
need
not
bother
communicating
with
the
housing
authority
again
about
this
subject.
i'm
unable
to
advice
the
court
as
to
the
content
of
the
waiver
of
immunity
which
was
offered
to
the
individual
in
question.
the
grand
jury
being
a
secret
proceeding,
we
were
not
acquainted
with
its
contents.
we
assume
it
was
a
general
waiver
of
immunity
and
we
have
not
seen
any
transcript
of
testimony
concerning
the
questioning
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
of
the
individual,
asking
him
to
sign
the
waiver
of
immunity.
the
letter
which
advised
the
appellant
corporation
that
it
was
disqualified
said
and
this
is
the
only
way
we
know
it
that
the
grand
jury
in
addition
to
investigating
alleged
bid
rigging
was
only
investigating
bribery
of
the
labor
official,
extortion,
coercion,
assault
and
conspiracy
of
each
of
these
other
things.
now,
our
argument
of
course
is
based
on
much
of
what
was
discussed
in
the
gardner
argument.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
the
order
of
disqualification
is
against
the
appellant
corporation.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
there's
an
automatic
disqualification
of
the
individual,
pursuant
to
the
statute
and
he
also
was
disqualified
but
this
proceeding
was
commenced
only
by
the
corporation.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
yes,
he
resigned
before
he
was
subpoenaed.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
that's
precisely
what
the
letter
said
that
because
of
his
refusal
--
because
of
the
former
president's
refusal
to
sign
the
waiver
of
immunity,
the
corporation
was
disqualified.
there
was
no
administrative
hearing
despite
the
fact
that
one
was
requested
and
there
were
no
questions
put
to
the
former
president
when
he
appeared
at
the
grand
jury
room.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
i
think
that's
considerable.
well,
may
i
say
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
state
law
will
approve
it,
yes!
i
believe,
however,
that
this
is
repugnant
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
to
the
privileges
of
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
i
agree
as
to
that
sir.
we're
not
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
no.
actually
sir,
what
we're
complaining
about
is
that
a
penalty
was
imposed
upon
the
corporation
in
a
manner
which
is
repugnant
to
the
due
process
clause
because
of
a
statute
which
imposed
the
penalty
upon
an
individual
contrary
to
spevack
against
klein.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well
actually,
we're
making
both
this
lock
out
point
and
the
point
in
spevack.
we
state
that
vicarious
disqualification
is
based
upon
an
unconstitutional
section
of
law.
and
it's
rendered
unconstitutional
not
only
by
spevack
but
also
by
virtue
of
slochower
because
we
were
afforded
no
rights
at
all
to
make
explanation.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
if
we
have
the
administrative
hearing
mr.
justice
black,
i
believe
that
we
could
have
found
out
whether
the
waiver
of
immunity
that
was
offered
to
the
former
officer
was
a
legal
one
and
we
would
have
been
able
to
determine
at
least
what
the
colloquy
had
been
between
the
assistant
district
attorney
and
the
officer
in
question
concerning
whether
this
grand
jury
was
operating
within
the
scope
of
the
statute.
we
don't
even
know
that
so
that
under
the
circumstances,
we
not
only
state
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
but
certainly
its
application
as
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
said
it
was
valid.it's
repugnant
to
due
process
and
the
slochower.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
we
would
be
making
the
same
argument,
yes,
certainly
in
connection
with
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
yes,
our
position
on
that
is
simply
that
even
under
spevack
and
mr.
justice
fortas'
concurring
opinion
that
this,
a
grand
jury
inquiry
is
not
the
proper
administrative
inquiry
to
determine
the
fitness
and
qualification
of
this
contract.
the
grand
jury
in
new
york
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
i
say
this.
i
believe
that
that
is
an
opening
question
in
spevack.
and
under
the
circumstances,
this
court
might
very
well
find
that
our
people
before
our
proper
administrative
tribunal
have
to
demonstrate
their
fitness
and
qualification
but
we
say
that
the
grand
jury
was
absolutely
the
wrong
tribunal
that
it
never
had
the
functions
of
determining
fitness
and
qualifications
of
a
public
contract.
in
fact
and
i
believe
this
is
set
forth
by
our
brief
with
--
in
some
detail.
the
grand
jury
by
statute
may
only
look
into
criminal
misconduct
of
public
officials
and
when
the
counsel
for
the
appellee
in
the
proceeding
argument
said
that
the
grand
jury
may
present
on
other
than
criminal
matters,
he
was
not
quite
stating
accurately
the
law
of
new
york
state.
the
lore
of
new
york
state
as
it
is
clearly
set
out
in
the
code
of
criminal
procedure.
it
says
that
in
the
cause
of
examining
into
whether
there
was
criminal
misconduct,
if
it
finds
that
there
was
non-criminal
misconduct
of
public
officials
that
at
the
discretion
of
the
court,
it
may
make
a
recommendation
concerning
this
non-criminal
misconduct
of
public
officials
but
there
again,
if
it
does
make
such
a
recommendation,
the
public
official
who
was
so
charged
has
the
right
within
31
days
to
file
an
asset
to
the
presentment
of
the
grand
jury
before
that
presentment
can
be
made
public.
and
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
i
believe
that's
certainly
one
of
the
points.
the
other
points
has
to
do
with
the
slochower
question
as
to
his
resignation
whether
in
fact
any
administrative
hearing
was
given
and
i
can't
say
that
it's
strictly
that
because
we
have
also
made
the
other
point.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
yes,
under
the
public
authorities
law
at
a
later
time,
section
2303
was
added
--
2603,
i
beg
your
pardon.
and
under
that
section,
a
corporation
after
its
disqualification
may
commence
a
proceeding,
establishing
one
that
there
was
cooperation
by
the
corporation
afterwards,
and
two,
that
the
person
who
was
the
recalcitrant
witness
so
to
speak,
had
not
actually
been
a
control
person
than
the
court
might
in
a
discretionary
fashion
remove
the
disqualification
if
it
was
in
the
public
interest
to
so
remove.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
yes,
it
does.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
the
stock
is
held
as
follows.
the
resigned
officer
had
10%
of
the
stock.
his
brothers
and
sisters
had
an
additional
40%
of
the
stock.
50%
of
the
stock
was
owned
by
the
estate
of
his
late
father
of
which
his
mother
was
one
of
the
principal
beneficiaries.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
there
is
no
publicly
held
stock.
this
is
a
closely
held
private
corporation.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
i
believe
this
court
has
held
in
united
states
against
white
that
the
privilege
cannot
be
used
by
a
corporation.
and
i
would
assume
that
in
following
it
through
to
the
state
of
facts
you've
mentioned
that
the
corporation
could
not
object
providing
that
it
met
that
competency
and
relevancy
and
materiality
test
of
evidence.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
yes.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
as
well
as
the
individual.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
it
is
a
problem
and
in
our
reply
brief,
we
explained
it
as
follows.
i'm
not
certain
that
the
explanation
is
sufficient
to
convince
you
sir
but
we
have
said
that
the
corporation
is
not
in
effect,
asserting
the
fifth
amendment.
the
corporation
is
asserting
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
that
as
a
result
of
an
illegal
penalty
that's
based
upon
an
individual
--
is
having
asserted
the
fifth
amendment,
the
corporation
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
being
deprived
of
its
property
without
due
process.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
i
must
say
that
i
think
what
you
say
is
correct
and
i
believe
that
it
is
basically
unfair
for
the
corporation
not
to
be
able
under
the
same
set
of
circumstances
as
i've
argued
to
assert
that
privilege.
however,
i
do
understand
that
this
court
has
ruled
with
in
contrary
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
basically
since
we're
talking
about
a
civil
penalty
which
was
vicariously
imposed
without
even
the
right
of
the
corporation
to
have
a
rudimentary
hearing,
i
say
that
that
is
repugnant
to
due
process.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
oh
yes.
we've
--
the
corporation
turned
over
all
its
records
and
the
other
officers
and
directors
all
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
and
waived
immunity.
in
addition
to
which
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
a
week
later.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
no,
before
it
was
disqualified.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
excuse
me
your
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
we
merely
ask
for
a
hearing.
the
hearing
did
not
specify
who
would
be
called
i
think
could
determine
on
the
nature
of
the
hearing
which
the
appellees
would
have
called.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice
that
that
question
was
left
open
in
the
spevack
decision
and
i
--
i
maintain
sir
that
even
if
that
right
--
well,
may
i
put
it
this
way.
even
if
these
were
the
case
that
he
could
have
been
called
before
a
disciplinary
hearing
appropriately
set
up
by
the
city
housing
authority
and
had
refused
to
testify,
it
is
entirely
possible
that
he
--
that
the
corporation
and
he
could
have
been
fired
without
changing
this
case
which
we're
arguing
at
the
moment.
i
--
my
point
is
that
the
grand
jury
is
not
a
disciplinary
proceeding
and
in
fact,
there
was
no
hearing
given
and
they
--
the
matter
of
the
fitness
and
qualification
of
the
individual
officer
as
well
as
the
corporation
was
never
put
in
issue.
if
in
fact,
that
had
been
put
in
issue
before
an
administrative
tribunal
then
i
do
not
know
what
the
answer
would
be
because
it
would
depend
very
much
on
whether
this
court
decides
that
the
fifth
amendment
under
malloy
and
hogan
and
spevack
covers
disciplinary
hearings
of
public
officials
as
well
as
public
contractors.
i
say
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
this
court
to
go
that
far
in
seeing
the
basic
unfairness
of
the
situation
which
resulted
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
the
record
reveals
that
when
counsel
first
hear
that
this
investigation
was
being
conducted
by
the
district
attorney's
office
and
that
there
was
a
possibility
that
subpoenas
might
be
served
upon
officers
of
the
corporation.
they
held
a
meeting
with
the
officers
and
directors
and
advise
them
that
this
might
happen
and
that
if
anyone
of
them
would
waive
--
would
refuse
to
waive
immunity,
he
had
best
get
out
of
the
corporation
as
an
officer
and
director
in
stockholding
and
the
only
one
who
said
that
for
personal
reasons
he
might
do
this
was
george
campbell,
jr.
and
that
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
it
was
to
the
corporation's
interest
to
have
them
all
waive
the
immunity
so
that
the
corporation
wouldn't
be
disqualified
if
and
when
they
were
subpoenaed.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
essentially,
that
is
correct.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
yes
sir.
but
this
was
a
private
corporation
and
i
say
that
while
the
state
has
the
burden
of
being
sure
that
its
contractual
obligations
do
not
violate
the
basic
bill
of
rights
when
a
person's
family
corporation
says
to
the
contrary,
it
might
be
an
entirely
different
picture.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
the
letter
--
the
record
does
indicate
that
the
grand
jury
was
investigating
bid
rigging,
bribery
of
the
labor
official,
extortion,
coercion
and
assault
and
a
conspiracy
to
commit
any
of
those
substantive
crimes.
and
i
must
argue
to
the
court
that
certainly,
within
the
realm
of
a
transaction
and
a
contract
with
the
state,
i
can
imagine
how
a
grand
jury
can
determine
the
issue
as
to
whether
an
assault
bears
upon
the
contractual
obligation
of
the
contractor
or
upon
his
fitness
or
qualification.
now,
i
respectfully
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
i
think
it
might
very
well
mr.
chief
justice
but
they
never
informed
you
--
the
corporation
or
the
client
who
was
the
alleged
recalcitrant
witness
just
what
the
circumstances
of
whether
they
were
investigating.
in
fact,
under
the
statute,
they
do
not
have
to
confine
the
grand
jury
investigation
to
only
the
contracts
in
question.
under
the
statute,
they
can
look
into
any
transaction
with
any
political
subdivision
or
any
public
official
and
i
assume
in
this
case
they
could
even
ask
questions
concerning
whether
his
taxes
were
paid,
whether
the
streets
were
properly
paid
outside
of
his
house
assuming
he
had
an
obligation
to
do
so
and
they
could
probably
ask
questions
which
not
in
the
least
could
affect
his
fitness
and
qualification
as
a
public
contractor
with
the
new
york
city
housing
authority.
so
all
i
can
say
on
this
is
that
without
specifically
being
advised
of
the
nature
of
the
inquiry
and
that
they
were
looking
into
the
contracts
which
were
allegedly
the
ones
in
question.
the
individual
would
be
waiving
immunity
as
to
all
kinds
of
remote
things
which
couldn't
possibly
bear
upon
fitness
and
qualification
and
therefore,
carrying
at
once
that
further,
the
corporation
could
in
turn
be
penalized
by
an
inquiry
that
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
its
function
as
a
public
contract.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
no.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
that's
correct
sir.
also,
i
might
add
that
the
individual
himself
was
disqualified
but
of
course
we're
obviously
not
raising
that
question.
we
say
that
the
corporation
despite
all
of
its
intents
to
cooperate
and
comply
in
every
respect
possible
was
vicariously
disqualified
because
of
an
unconstitutional
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
may
i
just
state
this.
they
never
asked
the
corporation
about
any
of
these
things
and
have
they
done
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
they
were
called.
yes.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
that's
correct.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
that's
correct
but
nothing
specific
was
asked
by
the
city
housing
authority.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
except
if
it
wasn't
the
city
housing
authority
conducting
the
grand
jury.
it
was
in
assistant
district
attorney
and
i'm
sure
he
wasn't
under
the
--
under
the
laws
of
new
york
allowed
to
divulge
what
happened
to
the
city
housing
authority
and
certainly,
it's
their
duty
to
determine
fitness
and
qualification
and
i
don't
believe
that
they
were
ever
able
to
find
out
because
there
is
a
strict
rule
of
secrecy
in
new
york
concerning
grand
juries
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
divulge
the
testimony
before
it.
and
under
the
circumstances,
if
the
city
housing
authority
wanted
to
find
out
something
about
this
corporation,
i
say
that
the
only
way
they
could
find
out
is
by
asking
the
corporation
because
the
grand
jury
wasn't
allowed
to
give
it
to
them
and
always
the
assistant
district
attorney
without
a
court
order.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
what
happened
was,
the
assistant
district
attorney
notified
the
city
housing
authority
that
george
campbell,
jr.
had
refused
to
waive.
they
in
turn
wrote
a
letter
to
the
corporation,
telling
the
corporation
that
based
upon
the
letter
from
the
assistant
district
attorney
informing
them
that
the
individual
had
refused
to
waive,
they
were
disqualifying
the
corporation.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
the
city
housing
authority.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
--
who
are
the
appellees.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
we
then
filed
the
necessary
--
well,
number
one,
we
asked
for
a
hearing
which
was
denied.
number
two,
we
filed
an
article
78
proceeding
which
is
a
special
proceeding
in
new
york
in
the
nature
of
the
review.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
a
judicial
review.
and
we
were
informed
by
opinion
that
we
were
in
the
wrong
remedy
that
we
should
start
a
plenary
action.
we
started
a
plenary
action
and
as
part
of
that
move
for
a
temporary
injunction.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
yes.
they're
both
in
this
case
sir.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
we
move
for
a
temporary
injunction
requesting
the
disqualification
be
held
up
pending
the
outcome
of
the
plenary
action
and
that
was
stayed
because
we
were
appealing
the
article
78
proceeding
and
then
the
appellant
division
of
the
new
york
supreme
court,
dismissed
both
claiming
that
we
were
obligated
to
stand
on
our
contracts
and
we
have
no
right
to
test
any
further.
we
then
went
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
the
contract
provided
in
advance
that
if
any
officer
or
director
of
the
corporation
were
called
before
a
grand
jury
and
this
is
the
statutory
language
--
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
in
the
contract.
that
if
any
--
if
any
officer
or
director
were
called
and
refused
to
waive
that
the
contracts
will
be
terminated
and
that
the
contractor
would
be
disqualified
for
five
years.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
yes,
we
did
sir.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
well,
there
are
two
questions
because
the
statute
contains
one
section
which
puts
it
into
the
contract
and
another
section
which
operates
separate
from
the
contract
and
we
have
argued
that
both
are
unconstitutional.
the
first,
because
the
state
may
not
impose
an
unconstitutional
provision
in
its
contracts
and
the
other
based
upon
the
fact
that
this
is
interrogation
of
spevack
and
also
slochower
because
of
the
due
process.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
that's
correct
sir.
the
statute
mandates
that
every
public
contract
don't
have
that
provision
in
it
and
we
say
that
the
statutory
direction
is
unconstitutional
because
it
requires
an
unconstitutional
provision
to
be
put
into
a
public
contract.
and
with
respect
to
the
--
to
the
letter,
may
i
just
call
to
your
attention
sir
the
dissenting
opinion
in
reagan
against
new
york
in
which
your
honor
joined
in
which
mr.
justice
douglas
said,
"so
far
as
i
know,
it
has
never
been
held
before
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
or
any
other
bill
of
rights
safeguard
can
be
bargained
away
far
in
advance
of
the
day
when
needed
as
protection
against
the
overreaching
power
of
government."
we
state
that
under
the
entire
line
of
unconstitutional
provisions
of
public
contracts
that
the
state
may
not
put
this
provision
into
a
public
contract
and
cause
the
contract
thereby
to
agree
to
unconstitutional
provision
in
the
contract.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
yes,
it
was
signed
by
the
president.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
yes
sir.
he
signed
three
contracts
in
the
short
period
when
he
was
the
president
which
was
about
seven
months.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
i
believe
i
did.
in
fact,
only
about
15%
of
the
business
of
this
corporation
was
with
this
particular
agency.
but
as
a
result
of
this
disqualification,
this
corporation
was
not
only
disqualified
from
doing
business
with
the
state
of
new
york
but
has
been
unable
to
get
some
contracts
with
other
states
and
with
many
private
companies
because
of
a
general
blacklisting
which
has
occurred
in
the
industry.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
yes,
i
believe.
although,
the
acting
process
case
which
this
court
decided,
indicated
that
whether
there
was
a
violation
with
the
anti-kickback
section,
only
the
one
contact
in
question
was
not
enforceable,
it
didn't
go
any
further
not
saying
a
general
blacklisting
for
a
specific
length
of
time.
now,
if
i
have
any
more
time,
may
reserve
it
for
rebuttal.
mr.
albert
a.
blinder
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
just
have
one
or
two
rebuttal
arguments
which
i
will
try
to
confine
in
just
a
few
moments.
number
one,
with
respect
to
the
irrelevancy
of
the
corporation
having
pleaded
guilty
to
one
count
of
a
misdemeanor,
may
i
just
say
this.
the
plea
of
guilty
that
was
offered
by
the
corporation
appellant
here
was
to
one
count
in
a
multi-count
indictment
that
was
offered
prior
to
the
commencement
of
a
mass
conspiracy
trial
that
lasted
over
three
months.
the
district
attorney
recommended
the
acceptance
of
the
one
misdemeanor
count.
in
fact,
this
was
a
business
decision.
it
would
have
cost
the
corporation
far
more
money
to
a
defendant
on
this
situation
and
then
there's
the
maximum
penalty
on
the
misdemeanor
that
it
pleaded
guilty
to.
it
did
not
plead
guilty
to
all
of
the
other
things
which
my
learned
friends
over
here
mentioned.
i
say
this
is
an
irrelevancy
because
under
the
new
york
state
law
the
fact
that
a
corporation
may
have
pleaded
guilty
does
not
result
in
automatic
disqualification
and
certainly
not
for
a
five
year
period.
the
only
way
this
occurs
is
if
someone
refuses
to
waive
immunity
or
refuses
to
--
or
asserts
his
privilege
against
self
incrimination
and
i
believe
that
that's
the
very
crux
of
the
argument.
now,
as
mr.
justice
fortas
inquired
before,
may
i
just
refer
to
the
learned
court
to
pages
25
and
26
of
our
appellant's
brief
which
contains
the
new
york
state
statutes
and
from
section
2(a)
of
section
253(a),
it
is
obvious
that
the
grand
jury's
power
derives
only
from
the
right
to
investigate
criminal
conduct
and
then
if
in
addition
to
its
investigation
of
criminal
conduct,
it
finds
non-criminal
conduct.
it
may
make
a
report
which
is
still
subject
to
certain
other
conditions
and
the
other
conditions
involve
the
preponderance
of
credible
and
legally
admissible
evidence
and
also,
it
gives
the
officer
an
opportunity
to
reply
before
this
report
can
be
made
public.
in
addition
to
which,
the
report
itself
is
limited
to
reporting
on
public
officers
and
public
employees.
now,
while
this
is
a
contractor
which
may
have
in
one
or
two
aspects
be
doing
certain
work
for
a
public
agency,
certainly,
none
of
the
officers
or
employees
of
this
corporation
would
deem
to
be
public
officers
or
--
or
public
employees
and
under
the
new
york
state
decision
on
the
subject,
i
don't
even
believe
under
this
section
that
a
report
can
be
handed
up
except
to
recommend
the
changes
in
the
law
but
it
cannot
bring
to
the
attention
of
an
administrative
agency
the
misconduct
of
a
public
contractor.
it
is
wholly
without
the
scope
of
the
grand
jury.
now,
with
respect
to
standing,
i
believe
that
the
attorney
general
in
his
brief,
attempted
to
say
that
this
was
a
situation
which
was
not
covered
by
the
pierce
or
by
the
joint
anti-facist
refugee
committee
case.
i
believe,
however,
that
in
an
analysis
of
this,
it
would
have
to
be
an
inescapable
conclusion
that
this
corporation
just
as
the
corporation
in
pierce
was
entitled
to
raise
the
issue
as
to
whether
its
business
or
property
were
taken
away
without
due
process
of
law.
in
addition
to
which
and
this
was
mentioned
by
learned
friend,
mr.
hessel.
in
holland
against
hogan
case
which
is
number
653
in
the
october
term
and
which
is
a
petition
for
certiorari,
the
attorney
general
argued
exactly
the
converse
of
this
situation.
in
that
case,
the
individuals
are
applying
for
certiorari
here
and
he
has
argued
that
it's
the
corporation
that
was
disqualified
and
therefore
the
individuals
have
no
standing,
the
corporation
must
bring
the
suit.
now,
i
submit
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
cannot
have
it
both
ways
either
we
have
standing
here
or
in
the
holland
against
hogan
case
there
is
standing
and
under
the
circumstances
since
we're
dealing
with
exactly
the
same
statute,
may
i
state
that
this
court
should
pass
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
which
i
believe
deprives
the
corporation
not
only
of
due
process
but
its
individual
officers
of
the
guarantees
of
the
fifth
amendment.
thank
you.
