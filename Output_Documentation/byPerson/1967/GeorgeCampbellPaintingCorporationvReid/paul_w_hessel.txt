mr.
paul
w.
hessel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
should
like
to
make
the
position
of
these
appellees
quite
clear
that
whereas
in
view
of
the
fact
that
we're
here
arguing
this
case
along
with
the
case
that's
relating
to
public
employees,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
court
of
appeals
has
sight
of
the
gardner
case
as
a
authority
that
have
decided
the
same
day
as
our
case,
as
authority
for
upholding
the
constitutionality
of
section
2601.
in
view
of
those
facts,
we
take
it
that
the
decision
of
this
court
on
the
public
employees'
case,
will
have
an
impact
in
my
opinion,
a
major
impact
upon
the
equation
of
the
constitutionality
of
section
2601
of
the
public
authorities
law
which
is
an
issue
in
this
case.
it
is
our
position
however
that
if
section
1123
and
article
i,
section
6
of
the
new
york
state
constitution
are
held
to
be
constitutional
with
respect
to
the
public
employees
and
certainly
in
our
opinion
a
fortiori,
this
section
of
the
public
authorities
law
which
imposes
as
somewhat
similar
duty
upon
public
contractors
rather
than
public
employees
should
likewise
be
held
unconstitutional
and
that
in
my
opinion
then
should
be
the
end
of
the
case
at
that
point.
however,
by
no
means
that
we
concede
that
the
commerce
is
true
because
there
are
so
many
points
of
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
cases
of
the
--
the
public
employees'
cases
that
under
any
circumstances,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
should
be
affirmed.
and
those
points
of
distinction
relate
--
are
based
upon
two
grounds.
one
on
the
general
proposition
as
section
2601
applies
to
public
contractors
all
over
the
state
generally
and
certainly
upon
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
this
particular
case,
some
of
which
had
been
brought
out
by
questioning
of
various
of
the
justice
of
this
court.
now,
with
that
purpose,
i
should
like
to
fill
in
somewhat
more
of
the
facts
in
this
case
that
have
been
thus
far
brought
out.
the
authority
which
is
the
appellee
here
is
a
state
created
agency.
and
in
fact,
it
is
so
designated
as
a
state
agency
under
the
public
housing
law,
designed
to
carry
out
the
functions
of
the
state
constitution
of
some
slum
clearance
and
the
creation
and
construction
of
public
housing
for
low
income
families
and
as
such,
all
of
the
statutes
of
the
state
according
to
public
corporations
or
public
divisions
applied
to
the
new
york
housing
authority,
the
appellee
here,
the
authorities
given
authorization
by
the
public
housing
law,
section
151
to
bid
its
public
contracts
for
maintenance
of
its
projects.
there
are
about
150
of
these
projects,
housing
equals
to
600,000
low
income
tenants
or
person.
in
the
bidding
of
its
periodic
painting
contracts,
three
of
these
contracts
were
bid
upon
by
this
upheld
and
cooperation.
and
it
has
been
brought
out
those
three
contracts
which
are
in
issue
here
was
signed
on
behalf
of
the
appellant
corporation
by
george
campbell,
jr.
its
president.
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
these
contracts
contained
the
mandatory
provision
of
section
2601
of
the
public
authorities
law
that
the
corporation
or
its
officers
--
corporation
of
that
contract
of
an
individual
or
if
a
corporation
and
its
officers
must
waive
immunity
and
answer
question
in
a
narrowly
related
field
and
i'm
referring
now,
particularly
calling
to
mind
mr.
justice
fortas'
statement
as
spevack,
that
the
corporation
must
as
section
2601
provides
by
its
officers
answer
questions
were
then
called
before
the
grand
jury
concerning
any
transaction
or
contract
have
with
the
state,
any
political
subdivision
thereof
a
public
authority
or
any
public
department
or
subdivision
of
the
state.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
the
corporation
or
its
officers
by
the
contract
as
your
honor
has
brought
up.
in
the
--
written
in
the
contract,
there
is
a
provision
that
the
corporation
or
its
officers
when
called
before
a
grand
jury
must
waive
immunity
and
answer
questions
in
this
very
narrow
field
--
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
only
with
respect
to
contracts
or
transactions
had
with
the
states
or
any
of
its
subdivisions.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
well
--
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
--
the
statute
doesn't
talk
about
it.
well
it
may
be.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
it
may
be.
that's
what
might
be
required
--
is
that
the
officer
testify,
concerning
any
transaction
which
may
involve
a
crime.i
can't
say
anything.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
that's
right,
by
contract.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
that's
right.
contract
voluntarily
subscribed
to
this
--
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
that's
right.
that
is
one
of
the
conditions
that
they're
complaining
about
and
i'll
come
to
that
question
on
provisioning.
now,
i
would
like
--
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
well,
as
long
as
it's
signed
--
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
well,
we're
not
maintaining
that
the
individual
george
campbell,
jr.
contracted
to
waive
immunity
at
the
time.
what
we're
maintaining
is
that
the
corporation
contracted
to
a
certain
consequences
as
a
result
of
the
failure
of
the
third
party
if
you
will,
to
accomplish
any
particular
or
to
furnish
particular
information.
now,
what
i
want
to
point
out
at
this
point
--
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
that's
so
far
as
the
individual
is
concern.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
yes.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
that's
right.
but
the
purpose
of
it
was
just
as
the
purpose
was
in
the
public
employees'
cases
to
furnish
information.
now,
in
addition
to
that
condition
in
this
context
--
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
that's
right.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
yes,
i
would
say
that
by
granting
the
community
under
section
2447,
to
an
individual,
the
state
can
get
answers
to
his
questions.
but
we
have
here
an
administrative
agency
which
is
interested
solely
in
the
qualifications
of
its
contract.
it's
up
to
the
district
attorney
or
the
grand
jury
who
are
concerned
with
punishment
to
grant
or
not
to
grant
immunity
under
the
statute
of
new
york.
now,
if
they're
conducting
a
criminal
investigation
in
which
they
do
not
find
it
desirable
to
grant
immunity.
what
does
the
administrative
agency
to
do?
to
continue
to
do
business
with
a
corporation
which
is
perhaps
under
investigation
at
that
time
in
which
they
know
that
some
question
should
be
answered
and
those
questions
would
be
available
if
the
corporation
carried
out
by
its
officers,
its
contractual
duty
to
furnish
that
information.
now
it's
to
the
statement
here
that
that
information
would
not
be
available
before
it's
a
grand
jury.there's
absolutely
no
basis
for
that
at
all.
i
don't
think
i'll
take
the
time
of
the
court
because
it's
fully
briefed
in
my
brief.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
in
regard
to
another
corporation
completely
unrelated.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
the
same
president
but
an
unrelated
corporation.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
no
interlocking
directorship
of
any
of
that
kind.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
i
would
say
under
new
york
law
that
possibly,
we
would
not
cancel
the
existing
contract
because
a
property
right
was
involved
there.
but
as
the
future
disqualification,
the
new
york
clause
has
so
held
that
in
fact,
even
if
there
were
only
an
indictment
and
not
a
conviction
at
that
time.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
you
mean
cancellation
of
the
contract?
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
yes.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
there
our
property
right
would
be
involved
and
i
would
say
--
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
well,
your
honor,
we've
called
and
made
a
distinction
between
cancellation
of
a
particular
contract
which
is
a
property
right
and
disqualification
for
bidding
on
future
contract.
now,
i
want
to
make
the
point
--
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
say
we
would.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
well,
under
this
statute,
there
is
relief
from
that
by
judicial
intervention
and
that
is
one
of
the
points
that
i
wanted
to
get
to.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
well,
that's
exactly
what
is
provided
for
in
the
statute
and
i'll
come
into
that.
there
is
now
a
--
since
a
question
of
hearing
has
been
raised,
here
is
another
point
of
distinction
between
this
and
the
public
authorities
and
the
public
employees
cases.
while
my
colleague
with
the
corporation
counsel's
office
has
taken
the
position
that
a
hearing
is
read
into
section
1123
and
that
may
very
well
be
so.
it
does
not
appear
on
the
face
of
that
statute.
the
public
authorities
law
on
the
other
hand,
expressly
provides
for
a
judicial
hearing
on
the
very
issue
that
has
been
raised
here.
now
the
issue
that
has
been
raised
--
that
was
raised
throughout
the
record
in
the
courts
below
was
not
a
constitutional
issue
at
all.
you
won't
find
any
constitutional
issue
in
the
record
of
this
case.
it
was
only
raised
on
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
issue
that
was
raised
was
solely
a
question
of
interpretation
of
the
statute
of
section
2601
and
that
is
as
to
whether
an
officer
who
have
resigned
just
before
being
called
before
the
grand
jury
was
still
to
be
considered
or
deemed
to
be
an
officer
for
the
purpose
of
that
section.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
so
decided
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
decision
is
binding
upon
this
court.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
negate
the
fact
that
this
young
man
had
resigned
just
before
he
was
called
before
the
grand
jury
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
say
that
in
view
of
these
particular
circumstances
and
in
view
of
the
nature
of
this
statute,
in
view
of
the
nature
of
the
requirement
that
he
shall
be
deemed
to
be
an
officer
enacting
in
his
capacity
at
that
time
he
was
subpoenaed
before
the
grand
jury.
moreover,
the
court
of
appeals
further
said
that
there
may
be
times
when
the
statute
will
operate
to
penalize
a
corporation
which
have
actually
served
at
its
connection
with
the
recalcitrant
officers
and
which
has
otherwise
been
cooperative.
this
is
precisely
the
circumstances
my
opponent
was
talking
about.
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
to
say
the
legislature
has,
however,
recognize
this
problem
and
has
specified
a
procedure
by
which
the
disqualification
can
be
removed
under
such
circumstances.
now,
here
is
not
only
an
administrative
hearing,
it's
a
plenary
judicial
hearing
which
this
corporation
had
available
to
him
in
addition
to
which
this
section
2603
which
i
have
just
read
from,
provides
that
such
in
cooperation
can
go
into
the
court,
the
supreme
court
and
get
a
stay
against
any
harm
to
it
whatsoever
including
a
stay
against
cancellation
of
this
very
contract.
now,
that
in
my
opinion
is
full
judicial
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
it
has
been
so
held
by
this
court
in
a
number
of
cases
which
we
cite.
now,
some
more
of
the
distinctive
provisions
between
--
the
distinctions
between
this
and
the
public
employee
cases
are
as
follows
and
i
think
this
is
to
touch
upon
some
of
the
questions.
here,
we
have
a
claim
of
violation
of
fifth
amendment
rights
of
somebody
who
is
not
even
here
in
court.
george
campbell,
jr.
is
not
a
party
to
this
preceding
only
the
corporation
is.
if
george
campbell,
jr.
had
been
a
party
to
this
proceeding
and
he
had
come
in
and
claimed
this
compulsive
waiver
was
costly
to
me
because,
one,
i
myself
was
the
contractor
who
is
disqualified.
that
is
an
issue
that
might
have
to
be
decided
in
line
with
the
public
employees'
cases.or
even
if
he
had
said,
i
am
the
principal
officer
stockholder
of
this
corporation
and
while
not
directly,
indirectly.
you
are
making
it
costly
to
me
to
exercise
my
fifth
amendment
right
and
therefore
it's
unconstitutional
for
you
to
do
so,
that's
another
situation.
but
that
is
not
the
situation
before
this
court
and
i
respectfully
point
out
to
this
court
that
i
think
you
will
shortly
have
that
situation
before
you
in
a
case
that
is
now
pending.
and
that's
the
case
of
holland
against
hogan
which
i
sat
and
listened
to
in
the
three-judge
court
down
in
new
york
and
which
i
believe
is
now
before
this
court
the
decision.
and
there,
i
believe
there
is
a
situation
of
an
officer
and
a
stockholder
of
milk
companies
as
i
believe
it
is
mr.
hirshowitz,
would
you
going
to
be
in
that
case,
who
are
claiming
that
very
violation
i
am
talking
about.
here,
we
have
no
such
situation.
now,
it's
a
peculiar
circumstance
in
this
case
that
this
contract
to
which
they
subscribe,
not
only
contain
the
one
condition
that
its
officers
must
waive
immunity
and
find
the
information
as
to
other
contracts
had
with
state
agencies.
it
contained
another
condition
that
in
my
opinion
was
even
more
open
to
complaint
that
they
complain
about
it
but
it
was
nevertheless
valid
and
that
is
that
at
the
time
the
contract
was
signed,
the
corporation
by
its
principal
officers
must
sign
a
non-collusive
affidavit.
i
believe
that
type
of
affidavit
is
required
in
federal
contracts.
there,
they
must
swear
that
they
have
not
been
entering
into
this
contract
colluded
with
any
other
person,
firm
or
corporation
to
rig
the
bid
and
so
on
and
so
on.
now,
there
is
a
condition
which
requires
a
statement
of
something
that
might
have
been
a
crime.
in
fact,
that
statement
turn
out
to
be
a
crime
because
as
the
record
here
shows,
mr.
george
campbell,
jr.
and
the
corporation
were
both
indicted
for
perjury
for
falsifying
that
non-collusive
affidavit
and
while
this
case
was
pending
and
coming
to
the
course
to
this
court,
both
the
corporation
and
mr.
george
campbell,
jr.
pleaded
guilty
to
an
indictment
of
bid
rigging
which
was
a
separate
indictment
which
included
this
perjury
count
in
a
non-collusive
affidavit.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
yes.
they
pleaded
guilty.
pleaded
guilty
and
we
have
attached
to
our
brief
because
it
came
up
only
after
the
matter
was
pending
on
this
court.
we
have
attached
to
the
appendix
in
our
brief
a
certified
copy
of
the
plea
of
guilty
from
the
county
clerk
accountant.
now
if
ever
there
was
demonstrated
in
this
court,
the
validity,
the
rationality,
the
reasonableness
of
these
very
conditions
in
these
public
contracts
that
are
now
before
this
court,
i
don't
see
how
there
could
have
been
better
demonstration
of
it.
now,
this
court
has
said
and
i
have
cited,
i
think
was
the
hoffman
case
that
a
public
agency
has
as
much
a
right
to
attached
conditions
to
its
contract
as
any
private
contractor
and
this
court
has
said
so
in
very
broad
terms.
now,
of
course
to
every
such
expression
that
must
be
attached
to
proviso
of
reasonableness.
of
course
i
would
concede
that
neither
on
a
public
contract
nor
a
private
contract
can
you
make
it
a
condition
that
the
contract
though
must
go
out
and
discriminate
or
shoot
people
or
commit
some
crime,
of
course
not.
but
a
reasonable
condition
such
as
i
have
described
that
swear
to
the
fact
that
you
have
not
colluded
with
anybody
else
in
bidding
upon
this
contract
to
agree
that
in
the
future
you
will
be
frank
and
open
if
called
before
--
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
alright,
let
me
answer
that.
section
2601
talks
about
both.
it
says
that
the
corporation
or
any
person
who've
been
called
before
in
a
grand
jury
--
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
here
it
is
sir.
a
clause
to
be
cited
on
all
contracts
provided
upon
refusal
of
a
person
called
to
appear
in
a
grand
jury
to
testify
concerning
any
transaction
or
to
sign
a
waiver
against
subsequent
criminal
prosecution
or
to
answer
any
relevant
question
concerning
such
transaction
or
contract.
and
then
in
that
even,
the
contract
can
be
cancelled
and
he
may
--
and
the
corporation
maybe
disqualified.
now,
i
think
as
i've
said
before
you.
it's
up
to
the
district
attorney
or
the
grand
jury
to
decide
whether
their
criminal
prosecution
in
the
public
interest
is
more
--
they
are
more
concerned
with
that
than
they
are
concerned
with
getting
administrative
information.
it's
up
to
the
administrative
agency
which
has
to
spend
the
state's
funds
to
be
concerned
with
the
question
of
getting
answers.
now,
if
the
district
attorney
of
the
grand
jury
under
the
statute
decides
that
they
will
not
grant
immunity.
they
will
not
permit
any
person
under
investigation
to
testify
without
a
waiver
then
the
administrative
agency
is
in
the
position
where
it
cannot
get
the
answers
to
the
question
that
it
should
have.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
if
granted
immunity.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
all
without
signing
a
waiver.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
well,
i
just
say
an
answer
to
that
your
honor
that
in
public
employee
cases
like
beilan,
lerner,
casey
all
off
against
welleby
that
the
waiver,
the
failure
to
waive
immunity
or
to
answer
questions
was
equated
either
as
whether
as
with
incompetency,
insubordination
or
various
other
violations
of
local
statute.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
well,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
that,
i
should
respectfully
like
to
refer
you
to
the
opinion
of
judge
kennedy
which
was
confirmed
--
affirmed
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
i
think
was
eloquent
and
quite
exhausting
and
pointed
out
that
a
public
contractor
should
by
far
more
firmly
be
in
a
position
to
be
subjected
to
the
requirement
of
candor
and
practice
even
then
a
public
employee
because
a
public
employee
can
be
selected
by
the
state
on
the
basis
of
qualifications
which
were
examined
long
beforehand.
they
can
be
rejected
by
the
state
for
lack
of
qualifications
of
various
kinds.
a
public
contractor
on
the
other
hand
aptly
is
forced
upon
a
public
agency
simply
through
the
bidding
process
and
therefore,
as
the
public
contractor
bidding
for
a
lucrative
contract
in
competition
with
others
in
his
position
who
are
willing
to
subscribe
to
these
provisions,
he
certainly
should
have
no
less
than
obligation
than
a
public
employee.
in
fact,
the
very
words
of
these
sections
of
the
public
authorities
law
arose
from
the
very
type
of
grand
jury
investigations
that
were
involved
here
and
you'll
find
in
my
brief
a
reference
to
the
birth
of
the
statute
through
the
governor's
message
who
approved
it
and
signed
it
and
i
think
the
attorney
general
has
a
reference
to
the
attorney
general's
recommendation
that
the
statute
be
adopted
because
a
grand
jury
was
frustrated
in
its
investigation
of
public
contracts
because
they
were
blocked
by
the
refusal
of
public
contractors
to
testify
before
a
grand
jury
either
to
waive
immunity
or
to
testify.
and
i
say
because
this
is
a
public
purpose,
a
vital
public
purpose,
important
public
purpose.
the
condition
that
was
created
here
is
one
that
is
in
all
respect,
it
should
be
held
valid
by
this
court
to
whether
or
not
the
public
employee
situation
is
decided
by
this
court
in
accordance
with
the
question
that
was
left
open
to
spevack
against
klein.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
in
this
case?
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
yes,
your
honor,
specifically
towards
--
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
no.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
no
sir,
it
is
not.
unfortunately,
my
friend
is
quite
wrong
in
that.
he
has
cited
in
his
brief
a
case
of
wood
against
hughes
i
think
as
the
court
of
appeals
decided
in
1961
which
upset
to
the
dismay
of
the
attorney
general
and
in
fact,
every
law
enforcement
agency
in
the
state,
upset
the
century
and
a
half
old
practice
of
grand
jury
presentments
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
statutory
authority
for
it.
that
is
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
because
the
statute
that
authorized
the
grand
jury
to
make
investigations
only
authorized
criminal
investigations
and
therefore,
they
could
not
make
presentments
as
to
civil
or
fraud
or
corruption
or
anything
else
as
to
which
no
indictments
resulted.that
was
in
1961.
in
1960,
just
about
three
or
four
years
thereafter,
that
case
was
overruled
by
a
specific
act
of
the
legislature
and
you
will
find
in
my
brief
the
government's
message
on
that
act
which
refer
to
that
case
and
said
that
it
was
unfortunate
the
court
of
appeals
so
held
but
we
are
now
presenting
a
statute
and
adopting
a
statute
which
expressly
authorized
the
very
type
of
presentment
they
had
theretofore
without
statutory
authorization
or
something
and
that
is
the
present
situation
today.
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
decision
here,
now
here
before
you
in
the
gardner
case
points
out
that
it
was
before
the
grand
jury
that
the
information
that
the
public
had
a
right
to
know
and
it
was
not
given
by
gardner.
now
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
obviously
must
mean
that
the
public
would
have
a
right
to
know
whatever
information
gardner
would
have
given.
had
he
testified
under
the
waiver
that
it
was
then
required.
there
is
no
question
any
longer
your
honor
that
under
new
york
law
today,
any
information
brought
before
the
grand
jury
can
upon
order
of
the
court
or
other
appropriate
procedure
be
brought
out.
in
fact,
as
i
said
before
the
very
birth
of
the
statute
arose
from
the
grand
jury
presentment.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
i
don't
agree
with
that.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
in
fact,
the
very
statute
--
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
i
say
that
is
not
true.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
in
fact,
the
very
statute
that
he
set
forth
in
his
appendix
as
a
provision
that
states
that
the
grand
jury
can
make
what
in
effect
was
called
presentments
as
to
corruption,
fraud
and
various
other
things
and
this
may
be
made
public
by
order
of
the
court.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
should
like
to
make
the
position
of
these
appellees
quite
clear
that
whereas
in
view
of
the
fact
that
we're
here
arguing
this
case
along
with
the
case
that's
relating
to
public
employees,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
court
of
appeals
has
sight
of
the
gardner
case
as
a
authority
that
have
decided
the
same
day
as
our
case,
as
authority
for
upholding
the
constitutionality
of
section
2601.
in
view
of
those
facts,
we
take
it
that
the
decision
of
this
court
on
the
public
employees'
case,
will
have
an
impact
in
my
opinion,
a
major
impact
upon
the
equation
of
the
constitutionality
of
section
2601
of
the
public
authorities
law
which
is
an
issue
in
this
case.
it
is
our
position
however
that
if
section
1123
and
article
i,
section
6
of
the
new
york
state
constitution
are
held
to
be
constitutional
with
respect
to
the
public
employees
and
certainly
in
our
opinion
a
fortiori,
this
section
of
the
public
authorities
law
which
imposes
as
somewhat
similar
duty
upon
public
contractors
rather
than
public
employees
should
likewise
be
held
unconstitutional
and
that
in
my
opinion
then
should
be
the
end
of
the
case
at
that
point.
however,
by
no
means
that
we
concede
that
the
commerce
is
true
because
there
are
so
many
points
of
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
cases
of
the
--
the
public
employees'
cases
that
under
any
circumstances,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
should
be
affirmed.
and
those
points
of
distinction
relate
--
are
based
upon
two
grounds.
one
on
the
general
proposition
as
section
2601
applies
to
public
contractors
all
over
the
state
generally
and
certainly
upon
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
this
particular
case,
some
of
which
had
been
brought
out
by
questioning
of
various
of
the
justice
of
this
court.
now,
with
that
purpose,
i
should
like
to
fill
in
somewhat
more
of
the
facts
in
this
case
that
have
been
thus
far
brought
out.
the
authority
which
is
the
appellee
here
is
a
state
created
agency.
and
in
fact,
it
is
so
designated
as
a
state
agency
under
the
public
housing
law,
designed
to
carry
out
the
functions
of
the
state
constitution
of
some
slum
clearance
and
the
creation
and
construction
of
public
housing
for
low
income
families
and
as
such,
all
of
the
statutes
of
the
state
according
to
public
corporations
or
public
divisions
applied
to
the
new
york
housing
authority,
the
appellee
here,
the
authorities
given
authorization
by
the
public
housing
law,
section
151
to
bid
its
public
contracts
for
maintenance
of
its
projects.
there
are
about
150
of
these
projects,
housing
equals
to
600,000
low
income
tenants
or
person.
in
the
bidding
of
its
periodic
painting
contracts,
three
of
these
contracts
were
bid
upon
by
this
upheld
and
cooperation.
and
it
has
been
brought
out
those
three
contracts
which
are
in
issue
here
was
signed
on
behalf
of
the
appellant
corporation
by
george
campbell,
jr.
its
president.
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
these
contracts
contained
the
mandatory
provision
of
section
2601
of
the
public
authorities
law
that
the
corporation
or
its
officers
--
corporation
of
that
contract
of
an
individual
or
if
a
corporation
and
its
officers
must
waive
immunity
and
answer
question
in
a
narrowly
related
field
and
i'm
referring
now,
particularly
calling
to
mind
mr.
justice
fortas'
statement
as
spevack,
that
the
corporation
must
as
section
2601
provides
by
its
officers
answer
questions
were
then
called
before
the
grand
jury
concerning
any
transaction
or
contract
have
with
the
state,
any
political
subdivision
thereof
a
public
authority
or
any
public
department
or
subdivision
of
the
state.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
the
corporation
or
its
officers
by
the
contract
as
your
honor
has
brought
up.
in
the
--
written
in
the
contract,
there
is
a
provision
that
the
corporation
or
its
officers
when
called
before
a
grand
jury
must
waive
immunity
and
answer
questions
in
this
very
narrow
field
--
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
only
with
respect
to
contracts
or
transactions
had
with
the
states
or
any
of
its
subdivisions.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
well
--
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
--
the
statute
doesn't
talk
about
it.
well
it
may
be.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
it
may
be.
that's
what
might
be
required
--
is
that
the
officer
testify,
concerning
any
transaction
which
may
involve
a
crime.i
can't
say
anything.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
that's
right,
by
contract.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
that's
right.
contract
voluntarily
subscribed
to
this
--
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
that's
right.
that
is
one
of
the
conditions
that
they're
complaining
about
and
i'll
come
to
that
question
on
provisioning.
now,
i
would
like
--
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
well,
as
long
as
it's
signed
--
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
well,
we're
not
maintaining
that
the
individual
george
campbell,
jr.
contracted
to
waive
immunity
at
the
time.
what
we're
maintaining
is
that
the
corporation
contracted
to
a
certain
consequences
as
a
result
of
the
failure
of
the
third
party
if
you
will,
to
accomplish
any
particular
or
to
furnish
particular
information.
now,
what
i
want
to
point
out
at
this
point
--
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
that's
so
far
as
the
individual
is
concern.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
yes.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
that's
right.
but
the
purpose
of
it
was
just
as
the
purpose
was
in
the
public
employees'
cases
to
furnish
information.
now,
in
addition
to
that
condition
in
this
context
--
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
that's
right.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
yes,
i
would
say
that
by
granting
the
community
under
section
2447,
to
an
individual,
the
state
can
get
answers
to
his
questions.
but
we
have
here
an
administrative
agency
which
is
interested
solely
in
the
qualifications
of
its
contract.
it's
up
to
the
district
attorney
or
the
grand
jury
who
are
concerned
with
punishment
to
grant
or
not
to
grant
immunity
under
the
statute
of
new
york.
now,
if
they're
conducting
a
criminal
investigation
in
which
they
do
not
find
it
desirable
to
grant
immunity.
what
does
the
administrative
agency
to
do?
to
continue
to
do
business
with
a
corporation
which
is
perhaps
under
investigation
at
that
time
in
which
they
know
that
some
question
should
be
answered
and
those
questions
would
be
available
if
the
corporation
carried
out
by
its
officers,
its
contractual
duty
to
furnish
that
information.
now
it's
to
the
statement
here
that
that
information
would
not
be
available
before
it's
a
grand
jury.there's
absolutely
no
basis
for
that
at
all.
i
don't
think
i'll
take
the
time
of
the
court
because
it's
fully
briefed
in
my
brief.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
in
regard
to
another
corporation
completely
unrelated.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
the
same
president
but
an
unrelated
corporation.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
no
interlocking
directorship
of
any
of
that
kind.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
i
would
say
under
new
york
law
that
possibly,
we
would
not
cancel
the
existing
contract
because
a
property
right
was
involved
there.
but
as
the
future
disqualification,
the
new
york
clause
has
so
held
that
in
fact,
even
if
there
were
only
an
indictment
and
not
a
conviction
at
that
time.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
you
mean
cancellation
of
the
contract?
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
yes.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
there
our
property
right
would
be
involved
and
i
would
say
--
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
well,
your
honor,
we've
called
and
made
a
distinction
between
cancellation
of
a
particular
contract
which
is
a
property
right
and
disqualification
for
bidding
on
future
contract.
now,
i
want
to
make
the
point
--
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
say
we
would.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
well,
under
this
statute,
there
is
relief
from
that
by
judicial
intervention
and
that
is
one
of
the
points
that
i
wanted
to
get
to.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
well,
that's
exactly
what
is
provided
for
in
the
statute
and
i'll
come
into
that.
there
is
now
a
--
since
a
question
of
hearing
has
been
raised,
here
is
another
point
of
distinction
between
this
and
the
public
authorities
and
the
public
employees
cases.
while
my
colleague
with
the
corporation
counsel's
office
has
taken
the
position
that
a
hearing
is
read
into
section
1123
and
that
may
very
well
be
so.
it
does
not
appear
on
the
face
of
that
statute.
the
public
authorities
law
on
the
other
hand,
expressly
provides
for
a
judicial
hearing
on
the
very
issue
that
has
been
raised
here.
now
the
issue
that
has
been
raised
--
that
was
raised
throughout
the
record
in
the
courts
below
was
not
a
constitutional
issue
at
all.
you
won't
find
any
constitutional
issue
in
the
record
of
this
case.
it
was
only
raised
on
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
issue
that
was
raised
was
solely
a
question
of
interpretation
of
the
statute
of
section
2601
and
that
is
as
to
whether
an
officer
who
have
resigned
just
before
being
called
before
the
grand
jury
was
still
to
be
considered
or
deemed
to
be
an
officer
for
the
purpose
of
that
section.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
so
decided
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
decision
is
binding
upon
this
court.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
negate
the
fact
that
this
young
man
had
resigned
just
before
he
was
called
before
the
grand
jury
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
say
that
in
view
of
these
particular
circumstances
and
in
view
of
the
nature
of
this
statute,
in
view
of
the
nature
of
the
requirement
that
he
shall
be
deemed
to
be
an
officer
enacting
in
his
capacity
at
that
time
he
was
subpoenaed
before
the
grand
jury.
moreover,
the
court
of
appeals
further
said
that
there
may
be
times
when
the
statute
will
operate
to
penalize
a
corporation
which
have
actually
served
at
its
connection
with
the
recalcitrant
officers
and
which
has
otherwise
been
cooperative.
this
is
precisely
the
circumstances
my
opponent
was
talking
about.
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
to
say
the
legislature
has,
however,
recognize
this
problem
and
has
specified
a
procedure
by
which
the
disqualification
can
be
removed
under
such
circumstances.
now,
here
is
not
only
an
administrative
hearing,
it's
a
plenary
judicial
hearing
which
this
corporation
had
available
to
him
in
addition
to
which
this
section
2603
which
i
have
just
read
from,
provides
that
such
in
cooperation
can
go
into
the
court,
the
supreme
court
and
get
a
stay
against
any
harm
to
it
whatsoever
including
a
stay
against
cancellation
of
this
very
contract.
now,
that
in
my
opinion
is
full
judicial
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
it
has
been
so
held
by
this
court
in
a
number
of
cases
which
we
cite.
now,
some
more
of
the
distinctive
provisions
between
--
the
distinctions
between
this
and
the
public
employee
cases
are
as
follows
and
i
think
this
is
to
touch
upon
some
of
the
questions.
here,
we
have
a
claim
of
violation
of
fifth
amendment
rights
of
somebody
who
is
not
even
here
in
court.
george
campbell,
jr.
is
not
a
party
to
this
preceding
only
the
corporation
is.
if
george
campbell,
jr.
had
been
a
party
to
this
proceeding
and
he
had
come
in
and
claimed
this
compulsive
waiver
was
costly
to
me
because,
one,
i
myself
was
the
contractor
who
is
disqualified.
that
is
an
issue
that
might
have
to
be
decided
in
line
with
the
public
employees'
cases.or
even
if
he
had
said,
i
am
the
principal
officer
stockholder
of
this
corporation
and
while
not
directly,
indirectly.
you
are
making
it
costly
to
me
to
exercise
my
fifth
amendment
right
and
therefore
it's
unconstitutional
for
you
to
do
so,
that's
another
situation.
but
that
is
not
the
situation
before
this
court
and
i
respectfully
point
out
to
this
court
that
i
think
you
will
shortly
have
that
situation
before
you
in
a
case
that
is
now
pending.
and
that's
the
case
of
holland
against
hogan
which
i
sat
and
listened
to
in
the
three-judge
court
down
in
new
york
and
which
i
believe
is
now
before
this
court
the
decision.
and
there,
i
believe
there
is
a
situation
of
an
officer
and
a
stockholder
of
milk
companies
as
i
believe
it
is
mr.
hirshowitz,
would
you
going
to
be
in
that
case,
who
are
claiming
that
very
violation
i
am
talking
about.
here,
we
have
no
such
situation.
now,
it's
a
peculiar
circumstance
in
this
case
that
this
contract
to
which
they
subscribe,
not
only
contain
the
one
condition
that
its
officers
must
waive
immunity
and
find
the
information
as
to
other
contracts
had
with
state
agencies.
it
contained
another
condition
that
in
my
opinion
was
even
more
open
to
complaint
that
they
complain
about
it
but
it
was
nevertheless
valid
and
that
is
that
at
the
time
the
contract
was
signed,
the
corporation
by
its
principal
officers
must
sign
a
non-collusive
affidavit.
i
believe
that
type
of
affidavit
is
required
in
federal
contracts.
there,
they
must
swear
that
they
have
not
been
entering
into
this
contract
colluded
with
any
other
person,
firm
or
corporation
to
rig
the
bid
and
so
on
and
so
on.
now,
there
is
a
condition
which
requires
a
statement
of
something
that
might
have
been
a
crime.
in
fact,
that
statement
turn
out
to
be
a
crime
because
as
the
record
here
shows,
mr.
george
campbell,
jr.
and
the
corporation
were
both
indicted
for
perjury
for
falsifying
that
non-collusive
affidavit
and
while
this
case
was
pending
and
coming
to
the
course
to
this
court,
both
the
corporation
and
mr.
george
campbell,
jr.
pleaded
guilty
to
an
indictment
of
bid
rigging
which
was
a
separate
indictment
which
included
this
perjury
count
in
a
non-collusive
affidavit.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
yes.
they
pleaded
guilty.
pleaded
guilty
and
we
have
attached
to
our
brief
because
it
came
up
only
after
the
matter
was
pending
on
this
court.
we
have
attached
to
the
appendix
in
our
brief
a
certified
copy
of
the
plea
of
guilty
from
the
county
clerk
accountant.
now
if
ever
there
was
demonstrated
in
this
court,
the
validity,
the
rationality,
the
reasonableness
of
these
very
conditions
in
these
public
contracts
that
are
now
before
this
court,
i
don't
see
how
there
could
have
been
better
demonstration
of
it.
now,
this
court
has
said
and
i
have
cited,
i
think
was
the
hoffman
case
that
a
public
agency
has
as
much
a
right
to
attached
conditions
to
its
contract
as
any
private
contractor
and
this
court
has
said
so
in
very
broad
terms.
now,
of
course
to
every
such
expression
that
must
be
attached
to
proviso
of
reasonableness.
of
course
i
would
concede
that
neither
on
a
public
contract
nor
a
private
contract
can
you
make
it
a
condition
that
the
contract
though
must
go
out
and
discriminate
or
shoot
people
or
commit
some
crime,
of
course
not.
but
a
reasonable
condition
such
as
i
have
described
that
swear
to
the
fact
that
you
have
not
colluded
with
anybody
else
in
bidding
upon
this
contract
to
agree
that
in
the
future
you
will
be
frank
and
open
if
called
before
--
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
alright,
let
me
answer
that.
section
2601
talks
about
both.
it
says
that
the
corporation
or
any
person
who've
been
called
before
in
a
grand
jury
--
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
here
it
is
sir.
a
clause
to
be
cited
on
all
contracts
provided
upon
refusal
of
a
person
called
to
appear
in
a
grand
jury
to
testify
concerning
any
transaction
or
to
sign
a
waiver
against
subsequent
criminal
prosecution
or
to
answer
any
relevant
question
concerning
such
transaction
or
contract.
and
then
in
that
even,
the
contract
can
be
cancelled
and
he
may
--
and
the
corporation
maybe
disqualified.
now,
i
think
as
i've
said
before
you.
it's
up
to
the
district
attorney
or
the
grand
jury
to
decide
whether
their
criminal
prosecution
in
the
public
interest
is
more
--
they
are
more
concerned
with
that
than
they
are
concerned
with
getting
administrative
information.
it's
up
to
the
administrative
agency
which
has
to
spend
the
state's
funds
to
be
concerned
with
the
question
of
getting
answers.
now,
if
the
district
attorney
of
the
grand
jury
under
the
statute
decides
that
they
will
not
grant
immunity.
they
will
not
permit
any
person
under
investigation
to
testify
without
a
waiver
then
the
administrative
agency
is
in
the
position
where
it
cannot
get
the
answers
to
the
question
that
it
should
have.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
if
granted
immunity.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
all
without
signing
a
waiver.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
well,
i
just
say
an
answer
to
that
your
honor
that
in
public
employee
cases
like
beilan,
lerner,
casey
all
off
against
welleby
that
the
waiver,
the
failure
to
waive
immunity
or
to
answer
questions
was
equated
either
as
whether
as
with
incompetency,
insubordination
or
various
other
violations
of
local
statute.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
well,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
that,
i
should
respectfully
like
to
refer
you
to
the
opinion
of
judge
kennedy
which
was
confirmed
--
affirmed
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
i
think
was
eloquent
and
quite
exhausting
and
pointed
out
that
a
public
contractor
should
by
far
more
firmly
be
in
a
position
to
be
subjected
to
the
requirement
of
candor
and
practice
even
then
a
public
employee
because
a
public
employee
can
be
selected
by
the
state
on
the
basis
of
qualifications
which
were
examined
long
beforehand.
they
can
be
rejected
by
the
state
for
lack
of
qualifications
of
various
kinds.
a
public
contractor
on
the
other
hand
aptly
is
forced
upon
a
public
agency
simply
through
the
bidding
process
and
therefore,
as
the
public
contractor
bidding
for
a
lucrative
contract
in
competition
with
others
in
his
position
who
are
willing
to
subscribe
to
these
provisions,
he
certainly
should
have
no
less
than
obligation
than
a
public
employee.
in
fact,
the
very
words
of
these
sections
of
the
public
authorities
law
arose
from
the
very
type
of
grand
jury
investigations
that
were
involved
here
and
you'll
find
in
my
brief
a
reference
to
the
birth
of
the
statute
through
the
governor's
message
who
approved
it
and
signed
it
and
i
think
the
attorney
general
has
a
reference
to
the
attorney
general's
recommendation
that
the
statute
be
adopted
because
a
grand
jury
was
frustrated
in
its
investigation
of
public
contracts
because
they
were
blocked
by
the
refusal
of
public
contractors
to
testify
before
a
grand
jury
either
to
waive
immunity
or
to
testify.
and
i
say
because
this
is
a
public
purpose,
a
vital
public
purpose,
important
public
purpose.
the
condition
that
was
created
here
is
one
that
is
in
all
respect,
it
should
be
held
valid
by
this
court
to
whether
or
not
the
public
employee
situation
is
decided
by
this
court
in
accordance
with
the
question
that
was
left
open
to
spevack
against
klein.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
in
this
case?
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
yes,
your
honor,
specifically
towards
--
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
no.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
no
sir,
it
is
not.
unfortunately,
my
friend
is
quite
wrong
in
that.
he
has
cited
in
his
brief
a
case
of
wood
against
hughes
i
think
as
the
court
of
appeals
decided
in
1961
which
upset
to
the
dismay
of
the
attorney
general
and
in
fact,
every
law
enforcement
agency
in
the
state,
upset
the
century
and
a
half
old
practice
of
grand
jury
presentments
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
statutory
authority
for
it.
that
is
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
because
the
statute
that
authorized
the
grand
jury
to
make
investigations
only
authorized
criminal
investigations
and
therefore,
they
could
not
make
presentments
as
to
civil
or
fraud
or
corruption
or
anything
else
as
to
which
no
indictments
resulted.that
was
in
1961.
in
1960,
just
about
three
or
four
years
thereafter,
that
case
was
overruled
by
a
specific
act
of
the
legislature
and
you
will
find
in
my
brief
the
government's
message
on
that
act
which
refer
to
that
case
and
said
that
it
was
unfortunate
the
court
of
appeals
so
held
but
we
are
now
presenting
a
statute
and
adopting
a
statute
which
expressly
authorized
the
very
type
of
presentment
they
had
theretofore
without
statutory
authorization
or
something
and
that
is
the
present
situation
today.
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
decision
here,
now
here
before
you
in
the
gardner
case
points
out
that
it
was
before
the
grand
jury
that
the
information
that
the
public
had
a
right
to
know
and
it
was
not
given
by
gardner.
now
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
obviously
must
mean
that
the
public
would
have
a
right
to
know
whatever
information
gardner
would
have
given.
had
he
testified
under
the
waiver
that
it
was
then
required.
there
is
no
question
any
longer
your
honor
that
under
new
york
law
today,
any
information
brought
before
the
grand
jury
can
upon
order
of
the
court
or
other
appropriate
procedure
be
brought
out.
in
fact,
as
i
said
before
the
very
birth
of
the
statute
arose
from
the
grand
jury
presentment.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
i
don't
agree
with
that.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
in
fact,
the
very
statute
--
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
i
say
that
is
not
true.
mr.
paul
w.
hessel
in
fact,
the
very
statute
that
he
set
forth
in
his
appendix
as
a
provision
that
states
that
the
grand
jury
can
make
what
in
effect
was
called
presentments
as
to
corruption,
fraud
and
various
other
things
and
this
may
be
made
public
by
order
of
the
court.
thank
you.
