a
federal
employee
is
or
at
least
maybe
for
many
purposes
is
different
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
case
of
spevack
against
klein
both
by
in
the
footnote
in
the
court's
opinion
and
also
in
a
concurring
opinion
that
when
you're
dealing
and
as
you
were
in
that
case
with
a
lawyer
who
is
not
a
public
employee,
different
consideration
--
different
constitutional
considerations
may
be
applicable
from
those
that
apply
between
an
employer
and
an
employee
when
the
employer
is
the
state
and
when
the
employee
is
an
officer
of
the
government.
you
began
in
this
case
by
saying
that
if
the
previous
case
were
decided
in
favor
of
the
respondent
a
fortiori
would
control
your
case
but
not
conversely
and
that
it
occurred
to
me
at
the
time
that
in
so
far
as
your
case
does
not
involve
a
public
employee,
your
adversary
might
have
more
rights
and
i'm
thinking
of
the
language
in
spevack
against
klein.
