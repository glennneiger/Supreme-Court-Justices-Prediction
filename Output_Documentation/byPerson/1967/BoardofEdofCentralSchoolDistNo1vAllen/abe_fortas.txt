justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
a
preliminary
--
another
preliminary
question,
please?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
certain
as
to
whether
the
act
and
the
regulations
make
it
clear
that
the
only
textbooks
that
can
be
purchased
and
furnished
to
a
parochial
school
are
textbooks
which
are
approved
by
a
state
authority
as
distinguished
from
the
governing
authority
of
the
parochial
schools.
are
you
telling
me
that
that
is
clear
in
the
law
and
(a)
in
the
law,
(b)
in
the
regulations?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
now
what
about
the
regulations?
they
seem
--
i
can't
look
at
where
they
--
justice
abe
fortas
because
when
i
read
them,
i
thought
that
the
ambiguity
to
say
the
least
was
carried
over.
justice
abe
fortas
into
the
regulations.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right,
but
that's
the
same.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
pointing
out
the
difference
between
secular
textbook
and
who
prescribes
it.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
confess
that
that
bothers
me
because
the
statute
does
read
as
if
the
statute
says
that
the
textbooks
should
be
those
that
are
designated
for
use
or
are
approved
by
any
boards
of
education
trustees
or
other
school
authorities.
it
might
make
substantial
difference
in
this
case
if
the
parochial
schools
have
the
power
to
designate
the
textbooks,
secular
textbooks
that
are
then
purchased
by
the
state
funds.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
want
to
take
any
more
of
your
time.
i
agree
with
you
on
page
67a
of
the
appendix.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
textbooks
have
to
be
secular,
but
i
--
perhaps
i
overlooked
or
have
forgotten
where
they
said
that
they
have
to
fix
–
such
the
books
have
to
be
designated
or
approved
by
a
public
authority.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
just
according
to
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
the
phrase
“school
authorities”
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
in
here
any
narrowing
down
of
this
troublesome
language
as
i
see
it
that
appears
in
the
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
what
is
the
status
of
this
opinion
of
the
counsel
that
perhaps
to
your
brief,
is
that
to
be
considered
as
a
regulation
of
the
board
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
bothers
me
then
is
that
the
statute
uses
only
the
term
“textbooks”.
it
does
not
say
“secular
textbooks”.
that's
number
one.
number
two,
the
opinion
of
the
counsel
as
i
read
it,
which
it
says
to
be
considered
as
a
regulation,
and
provides
that
textbook
shall
be
non-sectarian.
it
just
eliminates,
it
says,
denominational
editions
and
those
carrying
the
“imprimatur”
or
“nihil
obstat”
of
a
religious
authority.
it
says
non-sectarian
and
does
not
say
secular
and
there
is
a
difference,
isn't
there?
justice
abe
fortas
and
it's
only
when
you
get
to
the
opinion
--
majority
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
here
so
far
as
i
know
that
you
find
the
qualification
on
the
word
“textbooks”
meaning
that
--
as
saying
secular.
justice
abe
fortas
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
i
see
and
there
is
the
possibility
of
difference
in
the
substance
with
the
opinion
of
the
counsel
or
regulations
to
which
i
have
referred.
justice
abe
fortas
the
attorney
general
said
nonsectarian
that's
different
isn't.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it's
an
important
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
he's
made
it
clear
by
that
parenthetical
remark
in
6(a)
of
his
ruling
that
he's
talking
about
in
anyway,
when
he
says
nonsectarian,
he
means
nonsectarian
and
not
secular.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
is
a
rule?
what's
the
status
of
this?
justice
abe
fortas
well
your
adversary
said
that
he
didn't
spend
that
this
was
binding
but
correct
me
if
i'm
mistaken.
justice
abe
fortas
you
think
it's
not?
justice
abe
fortas
where
are
the
regulations
of
the
board
of
region
stand
that
are
referred
to
in
the
statute?
the
statute
says
that
such
textbooks
are
to
be
loan
free
to
such
children
such
rules
and
regulations
that
fare
maybe
prescribed
by
the
board
of
regents
and
such
board
of
education
trustees
or
other
school
authorities.
now
where
the
regulation
--
or
the
board
of
regents
is
this
is
not
--
justice
abe
fortas
no
ma'am,
but
i
want
to
know
what
the
opinion
of
the
counsel
is
why
it's
here.
is
this
to
be
considered
to
be
the
regulations
of
the
board
of
regents
prescribed
by
the
expressed
language
of
the
statute
or
is
it
not
--
there
would
be
an
answer
to
that?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
say
there
are
no
regulations
prescribed
by
the
board
of
regents
despite
the
language
of
the
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
the
statute
used
the
word
end
here.
it's
something
of
a
miss.
now,
is
there
anywhere
that
we
can
get
access
on
the
official
source
of
which
we
can
take
notice
to
a
list
of
the
books
that
have
actually
been
approved
or
whatever
it
may
be.
it's
not
in
this
record.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let
me
get
clear
about
this.
i'm
sorry
to
take
time
on
this
but
we
have
one
kind
of
case
here
if
this
statute
means
in
his
reply
so
exclusively
with
respect
to
secular
books.
by
that,
i
mean
secular
books.
i
don't
mean
nonsectarian
books.
we
have
another
kind
of
case
in
my
judgment
if
the
statute
is
used
to
public
funds
to
purchase
either
religious
books
or
sectarian
--
in
the
sectarian
sense
or
in
a
nonsectarian
sense
but
it's
still
religious
books.
i
think
we've
got
the
quite
different
considerations
that
apply
in
those
two
instances.
and
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
here
as
i
said
here,
in
the
absence
of
any
regulations
by
the
board
of
regents,
the
situation
is
far
from
clear
and
now,
as
i
understand
you,
you're
telling
me
that
the
actual
approval
of
these
books
is
by
the
local
boards
of
education
public
bodies,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
--
does
that
ever
go
to
the
central
board
of
regents?
justice
abe
fortas
right.
and
now
--
justice
abe
fortas
now,
you're
also
telling
us
though
that
there
no
directions
to
the
boards
of
education
that
within
a
broad
word
of
the
statute
which
regarding
with
textbooks.
there
has
been
no
instruction
of
the
board
of
education
of
this
various
communities
that
the
word
textbook
in
the
statute
means
only
secular
textbooks.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
this
opinion
was
handed
down
that
the
statute
has
been
an
operation
whatever
that
opinion
means.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you're
also
telling
us
in
any
child
--
any
school
of
the
child
if
he
decides
that
he
wants
such
and
such
a
book,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
it
can
apply
to
the
board
of
education?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
can
you
say
that
there's
no
way
at
all
for
us
to
have
access
to
a
list
that
shows
whether
in
fact
the
word
textbook
in
the
statute
has
been
construed
in
its
broad
sense
in
which
without
qualification,
it's
used
in
the
statute
in
the
sense
of
nonsectarian
as
used
in
the
opinion
of
counsel
to
the
department
of
education
or
in
the
still
narrow
sense
of
secular
as
used
in
the
majority
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
implementation
of
704,
i
think
it
is
that
says
it
can
have
subversive
textbooks?
is
there
any
regulation
or
anything
of
the
sort
of
the
board
of
regents?
justice
abe
fortas
mrs.
coon,
you
mentioned
the
preamble
to
the
statute
as
referring
to
nonsectarian
textbooks.
justice
abe
fortas
where
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
term
is
a
very
--
that
term
is
not
very
direct
description
of
the
kind
of
textbooks
embraced
in
the
statute.
all
it
says
is
that
it's
a
recital
that
the
calls
on
educational
opportunity
have
led
to
an
insufficient
proportion
of
our
population
educated
in
nonsectarian
subject
and
then
there's
no
reference
to
whatever.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
statute
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
appreciate
you
showing
it
to
me.
justice
abe
fortas
it
refers
to
textbooks
and
it
doesn't
say
whether
they're
to
be
restricted
by
nonsectarian
or
secular
so
far
as
this
statute
is
concerned,
why
does
--
why
is
the
language
brought
in
that
include
sectarian
or
religious
books.
justice
abe
fortas
that
long
experience
has
been
with
respect
to
public
education
and
not
parochial.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
a
preliminary
--
another
preliminary
question,
please?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
certain
as
to
whether
the
act
and
the
regulations
make
it
clear
that
the
only
textbooks
that
can
be
purchased
and
furnished
to
a
parochial
school
are
textbooks
which
are
approved
by
a
state
authority
as
distinguished
from
the
governing
authority
of
the
parochial
schools.
are
you
telling
me
that
that
is
clear
in
the
law
and
(a)
in
the
law,
(b)
in
the
regulations?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
now
what
about
the
regulations?
they
seem
--
i
can't
look
at
where
they
--
justice
abe
fortas
because
when
i
read
them,
i
thought
that
the
ambiguity
to
say
the
least
was
carried
over.
justice
abe
fortas
into
the
regulations.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right,
but
that's
the
same.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
pointing
out
the
difference
between
secular
textbook
and
who
prescribes
it.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
confess
that
that
bothers
me
because
the
statute
does
read
as
if
the
statute
says
that
the
textbooks
should
be
those
that
are
designated
for
use
or
are
approved
by
any
boards
of
education
trustees
or
other
school
authorities.
it
might
make
substantial
difference
in
this
case
if
the
parochial
schools
have
the
power
to
designate
the
textbooks,
secular
textbooks
that
are
then
purchased
by
the
state
funds.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
want
to
take
any
more
of
your
time.
i
agree
with
you
on
page
67a
of
the
appendix.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
textbooks
have
to
be
secular,
but
i
--
perhaps
i
overlooked
or
have
forgotten
where
they
said
that
they
have
to
fix
–
such
the
books
have
to
be
designated
or
approved
by
a
public
authority.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
just
according
to
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
the
phrase
“school
authorities”
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
in
here
any
narrowing
down
of
this
troublesome
language
as
i
see
it
that
appears
in
the
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg

what
is
the

of
the
counsel
that
perhaps
to
your
brief,
is
that
to
be
considered
as
a

of
the

justice
abe
fortas
what
bothers
me
then
is
that
the
statute
uses
only
the
term
“textbooks”.
it
does
not
say
“secular

that's
number
one.
number
two,
the
opinion
of
the
counsel
as
i
read
it,
which
it
says
to
be
considered
as
a
regulation,
and
provides
that
textbook
shall
be
non-sectarian.
it
just
eliminates,
it
says,
denominational
editions
and
those
carrying
the
“imprimatur”
or
“nihil
obstat”
of
a
religious
authority.
it
says
non-sectarian
and
does
not
say
secular
and
there
is
a
difference,
isn't
there?
justice
abe
fortas
and
it's
only
when
you
get
to
the
opinion
--
majority
opinion
of

so
far
as
i

you

where
are

the

now
where

justice

no

justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
can
you
say
that
there's
no
way
at
all
for
us
to
have
access
to
a
list
that
shows
whether
in
fact
the
word
textbook
in
the
statute
has
been
construed
in
its
broad
sense
in
which
without
qualification,
it's
used
in
the
statute
in
the
sense
of
nonsectarian
as
used
in
the
opinion
of
counsel
to
the
department
of
education
or
in
the
still
narrow
sense
of
secular
as
used
in
the
majority
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
implementation
of
704,
i
think
it
is
that
says
it
can
have
subversive
textbooks?
is
there
any
regulation
or
anything
of
the
sort
of
the
board
of
regents?
justice
abe
fortas
mrs.
coon,
you
mentioned
the
preamble
to
the
statute
as
referring
to
nonsectarian
textbooks.
justice
abe
fortas
where
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
term
is
a
very
--
that
term
is
not
very
direct
description
of
the
kind
of
textbooks
embraced
in
the
statute.
all
it
says
is
that
it's
a
recital
that
the
calls
on
educational
opportunity
have
led
to
an
insufficient
proportion
of
our
population
educated
in
nonsectarian
subject
and
then
there's
no
reference
to
whatever.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
statute
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
appreciate
you
showing
it
to
me.
justice
abe
fortas
it
refers
to
textbooks
and
it
doesn't
say
whether
they're
to
be
restricted
by
nonsectarian
or
secular
so
far
as
this
statute
is
concerned,
why
does
--
why
is
the
language
brought
in
that
include
sectarian
or
religious
books.
justice
abe
fortas
that
long
experience
has
been
with
respect
to
public
education
and
not
parochial.
