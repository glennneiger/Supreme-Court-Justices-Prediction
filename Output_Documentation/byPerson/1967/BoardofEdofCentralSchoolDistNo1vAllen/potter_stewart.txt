justice
potter
stewart
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
about
it?
not
to
the
center
but
the
new
york
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
brief
of
the
appellee,
it
stated
categorically
that
the
statutory
reading
on
the
footnote
on
page
three
of
the
intervener
appellee's
brief,
the
statutory
definition
of
“school
authorities”
in
education
law
section
2
subsection
12
makes
it
plain
that
this
phrase,
that
is
the
phrase
school
authorities,
which
means
the
public
school
authorities.
do
you
quarrel
with
that?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
statutory
definition.
the
statutory
--
what
is
the
statutory
definition
in
section
2(12)?
i
refer
to
that
on
page
three
of
school
authorities.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
definition
there
of
school
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
is
quite
apart
from
this
statute
that
we're
talking
about
now,
is
that
if
the
members
of
a
particular
religious
sect
got
control
of
any
public
school
board,
they
could
i
suppose
voice
upon
the
public
school
system
and
--
over
which
they
had
jurisdiction
in
all
sorts
of
religious
propaganda
in
the
form
of
textbooks,
if
that's
your
imaginary
horrible,
and
i
suppose
that
could
happen
–
justice
potter
stewart
--
with
or
without
this
statute,
right
in
the
public
schools.
justice
potter
stewart
they
could
begin
indoctrinating
public
schools
children
and
these
tenants
of
the
lutheran
church
for
example
if
the
little
three
missionaries
got
control
of
the
particular
school
board.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
would
set
the
courts
out
there
to
judge
it
as
to
how
much
of
any
religious
propaganda
that
were
in
any
particular
textbook?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
at
least
as
difficult.
justice
potter
stewart
well
at
least--
justice
potter
stewart
if
there
is
an
inconsistency
between
the
opinion
of
counsel
and
the
judgment
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
which
would
prevail
as
to
the
construction
of
this
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
part
of
the
very
educational
classroom
process
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
you're
distinguished
--
you
could
distinguish
that
from
this
other
kind
of
situations
on
that
basis,
couldn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
the
statutory
of
limitation
is
so
much
dollar
in
how
many
dollars
for
pupil
i
think
then?
justice
potter
stewart
mrs.
coon,
one
thing
that's
not
entirely
clear
to
me
is
this.
what
was
the
situation
before
the
enactment
of
this
law
in
1965?
this
law
as
i
read
it,
provides
for
the
furnishing
of
textbooks
to
students
in
both
as
it
says
in
public
or
private
schools
which
comply
with
the
compulsory
education
law.
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
law,
were
textbooks
furnished
to
students
in
public
schools?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
local
option
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
remember
that.
justice
potter
stewart
now
this
law
is
applicable
by
its
terms
to
both
public
and
private
schools
and
requires
now
the
school
boards
--
justice
potter
stewart
all
over
the
state.
justice
potter
stewart
and
those
school
districts,
books
were
not
provided
even
in
the
public
school.
justice
potter
stewart
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
about
it?
not
to
the

but
the

justice

the

i
