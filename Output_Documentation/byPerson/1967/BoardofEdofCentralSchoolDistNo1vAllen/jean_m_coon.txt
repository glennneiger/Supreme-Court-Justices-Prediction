ms.
jean
m.
coon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
initially,
i
think
what
i
would
like
to
do
is
to
give
some
observations
to
some
of
the
questions
of
this
court
which
were
directed
to
mr.
pollock.
as
to
the
issue
of
standing
to
sue
being
raised
in
this
court,
no
one
has
raised
it.
we
have
considered
that
the
issue
withstanding
to
sue
was
one
of
state
law.
it
relates
to
the
peculiar
problems
and
provision
of
state
law
and
the
interpretation
which
the
state
courts
have
placed
upon
standing
to
sue
and
that
the
decision
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
that
under
these
particular
circumstances,
the
east
greenbush
and
school
board
had
standing
to
sue
that
it
was
foreclosed
from
consideration
in
this
court.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it's
for
one
of
jurisdiction
based
upon
what
we
felt
were
prior
decisions
of
this
court
which
involved
not
a
question
--
it
was
not
a
question
of
standing
the
sue
it
involved
the
merits
of
the
sue
itself.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes
sir.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
pardon
me.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
the
standing
to
sue
which
was
raised
was
standing
to
sue
under
state
law
and
now
a
question
of
the
general
right
of
a
taxpayer
as
may
have
it
raised
in
this
court.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes
but
i
think
that
it
has
been
considered
i
think
by
all
the
parties
in
this
case
if
this
was
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
certainly,
if
this
court
were,
itself,
to
consider
that
standing
to
sue
is
a
problem
of
this
court,
you
certainly
decide
it
on
that
basis.
but
the
issue
that
was
raised
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
i
believe
it
was.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
i
would
assume
that
the
initial
problem
which
raised
their
--
which
started
the
sanction
was
that
the
members
of
the
board
themselves,
felt
that
the
law
was
unconstitutional
both
under
the
state
and
federal
constitutions.
and
that
while
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
as
the
final
arbiter
to
the
state
constitution
provisions
that
they
will
still
consider
that
there
is
a
question
and
a
dilemma
raised
for
them
under
the
federal
constitution
that
if
they
still
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
an
error
as
to
the
federal
constitutional
question
then
and
until
they
got
a
decision
on
the
merits
from
this
court,
they
would
still
be
faced
with
their
own
personal
dilemma
of
either
refusing
to
bail
a
law
which
they
consider
it
to
be
unconstitutional
federally
or
face
the
sanctions
of
the
education
law.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
but
certainly
wipe
out
the
premise
if
they
were
contending
to
accept
the
decision.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
would
wipe
out
that
premise
if
they
are
willing
to
accept
the
decision
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
on
the
issue
of
constitutionality
which
apparently
they
are
not
since
they
are
here.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no
sir
but
they
were
hoping
that
you
will
say
it's
unconstitutional
in
the
federal
constitution
and
since
they
as
public
officials
in
new
york
not
only
to
uphold
the
statement
but
also
the
federal
constitution.
that
would
be
if
they
would
have
an
issue
in
there.
as
to
the
questions
to
who
designates
these
books.
mr.
justice
fortas
question
was
one
that
somewhat
a
surprise
to
us
because
i
don't
think
anyone
in
new
york
has
ever
assume
that
anyone
--
other
than
the
public
school
officials
and
public
school
boards
for
the
final
--
once
we
have
the
control
over
the
designation
of
the
books.
the
terms
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no
sir.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that
is
true.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
a
secular
text.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that's
what
the
court
said
and
i
think
this
is
what
the
statute
had
in
mind
because
when
the
--
when
the
statute
said
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes
sir.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
suppose
it
is
but
i
think
we
were
--
this
is
not
what
we
were
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
i
think
that
the
attorney
general
has
said
not
sectarian
in
this
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
oh
sir.
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
fortas
that
i
do
not
know
you're
referring
to
that.
the
opinion
of
the
counsel
of
the
education
department
is
not
an
opinion
of
the
attorney
general.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
the
status
of
this
is,
is
that
as
an
opinion
actually
from
our
office,
it's
an
advisory
opinion
only.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
think
that
the
counsel
â€“-
ms.
jean
m.
coon
--
no,
the
counsel
of
the
education
department
like
the
new
york
attorney
general
would
like
very
much
to
have
his
opinions
binding
but
they
are
entered
in
an
advisory
capacity
only.
the
only
authority
that
an
opinion
of
the
counsel
to
the
education
department
has
is
that
it
maybe
supposed
to
represent
the
policy
of
the
education
department
and
the
commissioner
and
therefore
in
a
proceeding
before
the
commissioner
to
appeal
from
a
determination
of
a
local
school
board.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
as
far
as
i
know,
the
opinion
of
the
counsel
--
it's
the
only
thing
approaching
a
rule
of
regulations
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
this
is
not
as
far
as
i
know
that
adopted
as
the
rule
and
regulation
of
the
board.
the
counsel
of
the
education
department
is
of
course
also
accounts
into
the
board
of
regents.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no.
i
believe
that
the
language
of
course
also
refers
to
regulation
to
be
adopted
by
local
school
boards
and
i
think
it
has
been
left
to
the
local
school
boards
within
the
framework
of
the
advisory
opinion
of
the
education
department.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no
sir.
as
far
as
i
know,
there
is
no
compilation
of
these
texts.
they
are
determined
by
individual
school
boards.
each
public
school
board
in
the
state
has
the
authority
to
designate
the
textbooks
to
be
used
in
that
particular
school
district
to
public
school
district
and
they
also,
under
the
statute,
approved
upon
request
of
the
individual
students
to
request
additional
textbooks
which
are
not
authorized
--
already
designated
for
use
in
public
schools
but
may
also
request
that
time
an
additional
book
which
the
board
may
approve
or
may
not
approve
as
it
see
is
fit.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes
sir.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it
would
only
go
to
the
board
of
regents
or
particularly
to
the
commissioner
of
education
if
a
local
taxpayer
in
one
of
the
school
districts
disputed
a
termination
of
the
local
school
board,
possibly
someone
who
objected
to
a
book
which
they
felt
was
sectarian
or
religious
and
nonsectarian
sense.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
can
appeal
to
the
commissioner
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no
sir
except
from
the
framework
of
this
opinion
which
has
been
given.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no
sir.
it
was
handed
down
after
the
original
argument
of
this
case
in
supreme
court
albany
county
but
not
after
the
statute
went
into
operation.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
this
was
an
advice
to
the
school
districts
on
how
they
were
to
go
about
purchasing
the
textbooks,
what
book
are
to
be
involved
and
how
also
you
will
see
in
there
the
process
for
processing
the
reimbursement
provisions.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes
sir.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
he
may
if
it
is
a
textbook
which
he
is
required
to
use
in
a
school.
he
can't
decide
that
some
book
he
seen
in
the
library
would
make
a
good
book
and
bring
to
him
at
home
and
apply
for
that
one.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
but
i
think
that
it
should
be
made
clear
that
the
distinction
here
is
between
these
textbooks
are
by
law
required
to
be
provided
to
the
students
and
not
to
the
schools
they
attend.
and
that
it
is
the
individual
request
of
the
student
which
is
involved
here.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
could
inquire
of
the
education
any
problem
where
there
has
been
any
further
implementation
since
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
refers
to
secular.
as
far
as
i
know,
there
has
not
and
as
far
as
i
also
--
as
far
as
i
know
that
there
have
not
been
any
list
of
what
textbooks
are
involved.
but
i
can
inquire
of
the
department
to
find
out
if
they
have
any
list
but
i
don'
believe
that
they
have.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
don't
know
whether
there
has
been
any
list
promulgated
of
any
textbooks
which
they
consider
subversive
or
not.
i
think
the
question
usually
arises
in
relation
to
a
request
to
the
counsel
of
the
education
department
or
an
opinion
to
whether
or
not
a
particular
textbook
is
permissible
in
use
or
may
arise
an
issue
of
a
taxpayer
bringing
a
proceeding
an
appeal
to
the
commissioner
from
a
determination
of
a
school
board
to
use
a
text
which
they
would
consider
to
be
subversive.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
the
commissioner
of
education.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
the
regents
of
course,
the
commissioner
of
education.
some
of
the
regions
could
adapt
regulations
also
with
the
general
authority
--
administrative
authority
over
the
administration
of
the
education
law
is
in
the
commissioner
of
education.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
as
supervised
by
the
board
of
regents
--
the
board
of
regents
is
a
general
policy
making
organization.
i
don't
think
they
--
as
a
rule,
do
not
get
down
to
the
individual
question.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
oh
yes
sir,
they
would
have
that.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
would
have
authority.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
board
of
regents,
yes
sir.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes
sir.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
say
as
far
as
students
who
are
enrolled
in
the
private
schools
in
new
york
city
as
distinguished
in
public
schools
that
they
could
request
a
textbook
which
might
be
used
in
the
public
schools
or
approved
by
the
public
school
board
of
the
city
of
buffalo
but
has
not
been
approved
or
designated
for
use
in
the
public
schools
in
new
york
city
and
be
entitled
to
receive
it
under
this
law.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
the
new
york
city
school
board
under
those
circumstances.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
from
the
same
publisher,
the
buffalo
buys
it
from.
i
don't
know
to
what
extent
there
is
uniformity
throughout
the
state
in
textbooks
that
are
used
in
the
public
schools.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no
sir.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
believe
it's
something
on
the
line
of
what,
$13
million
or
$14
million
i
think
since
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no.
i
think
that's
the
total
that
is
total
since
they
program
one
into
effect.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it
works
this
way.
for
the
first
three
years
of
the
statute,
the
local
school
board
was
limited
to
a
requirement
that
it
spend
$15.00
per
pupil
--
not
more
than
$15.00
per
pupil
and
it
was
entitled
to
total
reimbursement
from
the
state
in
that
amount.
the
school
boards
also
had
the
option
to
provided
additional
textbooks.
above
and
beyond
is
$15.00
limit
on
which
they
are
reimbursed
upon
a
reimbursement
formula
which
involves
total
school
expenditures
related
to
the
tax
rolls
of
the
district
and
so
forth
which
amounts
to
something
less
than
total
reimbursement.
in
some
districts,
it
amounts
to
something
less
than
50%
of
their
school
cost
and
others
that
maybe
as
high
as
75%
to
98%
depending
upon
the
economic
status
of
the
district
itself.
the
total
gives
me
the
figures
on
total
textbook
expenditures
in
1966,
â€˜67
for
the
state
was
nineteen
million
and
tow
hundred
and
thirteen
thousand
dollars
and
this
is
the
total
expenditure
so
far
of
the
product
and
it
was
of
course
initially
considered
that
the
initial
expenditures
in
the
first
few
year
would
be
highest
because
of
the
fact
of
the
new
statute
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
the
child
must
return
either
to
the
public
school
district
or
to
a
designated
point
of
storage
for
them
at
the
end
of
each
semester
of
each
school
year.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
devote
the
remaining
time
to
hitting
some
of
the
highlights
or
what
we
believe
are
the
important
things
for
this
court
to
consider
and
to
bear
in
mind
to
decide
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
it
is
the
problem
with
which
new
york
state
was
faced
and
is
facing
in
the
time
when
we
adopted
the
statute.
there
is
an
educational
crisis
developing
not
just
in
new
york
but
in
this
country
as
a
whole
and
it
has
developed
to
the
point
where
not
only
the
local
government
but
also
the
state
and
the
federal
government
are
pouring
immense
amounts
of
money
into
the
school
systems
primarily
to
help
the
educationally
disadvantaged.
the
private
schools
children
who
are
involved
in
this
case
are
not
simply
children
or
parents
who
can
afford
to
send
them
to
tuition
paying
schools.
there
are
among
them
also
the
educationally
disadvantaged.
and
in
this
particular
instance,
new
york
in
deciding
that
it
was
important
that
students
in
the
schools
--
the
school
children
of
the
state
have
available
to
them
up-to-date
textbooks,
consider
the
question
of
not
only
to
provide
them
but
to
whom.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
in
some
cases,
yes.
prior
to
the
enactment
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it's
local
option.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
had
three
options
to
purchase
the
textbooks
and
then
rent
them
to
the
students,
to
sell
them
to
the
students,
to
require
students
to
purchase
their
own
textbooks
or
if
the
voters
of
the
school
district
approved,
the
school
district
could
provide
free
textbooks.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
and
requires
them
to
do
so.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it
should
be
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
before
the
law,
there
were
free
textbooks
in
some
cases
and
not
all.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
say
in
most,
they
probably
were.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
in
new
york
city
they
were.
although
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
we
list
12
of
the
school
districts
which
range
from
small
rural
school
districts
to
those
involving
cities
as
large
as
the
city
of
syracuse
in
which
free
textbooks
were
not
provided
prior
to
this
time
and
in
many
of
those
districts.
there
were
areas
especially
in
the
new
--
area
where
there
have
been
large
packets
of
unemployment
--
large
unemployment
problems.
the
syracuse
area
which
has
been
subjected
to
considerable
in
flow
of
migrants
from
not
only
from
the
south
but
also
from
mining
areas
in
pennsylvania
in
the
appellation
area.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
were
not
provided
and
even
in
public
schools.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
there
was
if
the
voters
of
the
district
would
approve
and
this
was
one
in
which
the
school
board
itself
have
no
control.
this
was
one
solely
within
the
control
of
the
voters
in
the
district.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
let
me
put
it
this
way.
that
certainly
--
any
of
the
school,
the
parochial
school
could
tell
any
students
what
textbooks
it
wanted
them
to
get.
in
other
words,
for
this
particular
course,
you're
going
to
want
x
textbook.
and
the
school
child
then
can
fill
in
a
form
which
he
request
this
of
a
public
school
district.
now,
the
public
school
district
then
has
two
options.
one,
if
this
is
a
book
which
has
been
designated
for
use
â€“
ms.
jean
m.
coon
designated
for
use
in
the
public
schools
by
the
public
school
board
and
then
there's
no
problem
about
the
student
getting
the
book.
if
it
is
not
then
the
public
school
district,
the
board
of
education
district
has
under
this
law
the
option
to
approve
or
not
to
approve
that
book.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
but
they
could
approve
it
and
then
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
could
in
those
courses
which
would
be
not
religion
course.
it's
not
teaching
religion.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
in
those
courses
which
did
not
teach
religion,
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
assuming
also
this
would
be
only
for
grade
7
through
12,
in
other
words
junior
and
senior
high
schools.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes
sir.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
our
statutory
definition
is
while
the
statutory
definition
if
you
take
the
preamble
of
the
statute,
it
refers
to
nonsectarian
textbooks
but
i
think
this
has
been
interpreted
in
the
court
of
appeals
has
interpreted
all
of
these
to
require
secular
textbooks
in
that
regard.
so
that
to
the
extent
that
over
a
course
of
time,
it's
been
highly
possible
that
within
the
range
of
a
statute
be
--
with
the
exception
of
courses
teaching
religion
that
the
parochial
school
children
could
get
all
of
their
textbooks
in
grade
7
through
12.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that
maybe.
what
raises
problems
is
of
course
is
to
what
they
would
use
these
books
for.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it
might
have
some
problem
else,
along
the
same
lines
of
course
is
the
question
of
a
tuition
allowance
which
was
raised
in
vermont
i
believe
which
the
students
were
--
people
are
using
this
to
attend
the
religious
schools.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that
if
this
is
--
if
this
we're
going
to
go
in
that
matter.
now,
of
course
one
of
the
things
with
g.i.
bill
the
same
thing
with
new
york
scholar
and
set
a
program,
these
are
open
to
all
students
unlike
without
regard
to
where
they
go.
the
same
situation
here,
the
textbooks
are
available
to
all
children
regardless
of
the
school
they
attend
and
in
that
regard,
it
is
not
a
--
it
is
a
law
which
does
not
discriminate
between
the
religion
and
not
religion
between
the
sectarian
and
nonsectarian
schools.
it
is
neutral
as
between
--
not
only
as
between
religions
but
it
is
between
religion
and
non-religion.
how
we
think
to
that
extent,
it
means
to
test
them
and
lay
down
by
this
court
in
cases
like
everson
and
some
of
the
others.
and
also
of
course
is
i
would
bring
out
the
secular
purpose
of
providing
this
means
of
educating
a
child,
excess
of
the
child
through
education
material
in
the
sense
of
a
textbook.
to
children
regardless
of
their
--
the
school
they
attend
that
this
is
a
purpose
within
--
what
was
in
the
sunday
closing
cases
for
example
is
a
purpose
which
is
secular
in
origin
and
it
is
a
primary
purpose
of
aide
to
the
school
child
in
this
particular
case
of
helping
him
to
get
a
better
secular
education
and
not
an
education
sectarian
or
religious
subjects
but
in
those
subjects
which
he
needs
to
enjoy
and
to
further
his
competitive
advantage
economically
as
he
gets
older
and
gets
out
of
school.
the
problem
has
been
pointed
out
and
we've
pointed
out
in
our
brief.
the
problem
of
a
child
from
an
economically
disadvantage
family
with
several
children
in
school
and
maybe
required
to
spend
$15.00
to
$20.00
per
child
in
purchasing
textbook
but
they
don't
have
a
their
set
money
for
their
necessities
of
life.
they
certainly
don't
have
the
money
to
spend
on
textbook
and
this
maybe
a
cause
of
a
child
dropping
out
of
school.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
refers
to
nonsectarian
subjects
in
schools.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it's
quoted
on
page
20
of
our
brief
at
one
point
anyway.
and
it
refers
to
the
--
the
term
by
the
correcting
of
education
on
balances
which
have
read
to
an
insufficient
portion
of
our
population
educating
the
field
of
science,
mathematics,
foreign
language
and
other
nonsectarian
subjects.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
now,
i
think
this
is
--
we
have
to
read
the
preamble
in
line
with
what
has
been
--
what
was
said
in
the
statute
itself
about
the
approval
of
the
books
and
so
forth
and
this
has
been
interpreted.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
the
statute
talks
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
the
statute
refers
to
textbooks.
it's
cited
at
page
--
let's
see,
1(a)
of
the
appellant's
brief.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
say
this
justice
fortas
that
if
in
a
relation
here
that
the
use
of
the
words
here
textbooks
which
are
designated
for
use
in
any
public
elementary
or
secondary
schools
of
the
state
are
approve
by
any
boards
of
education
trustees
or
the
school
authorities,
meaning
public
school
authorities
that
this
has
been
interpreted
by
the
administrative
agencies
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
--
new
york
court
of
appeals,
to
mean
only
secular
textbooks,
in
other
words,
nonreligious
textbooks.
i
think
on
this
basis,
i
think
will
leave
the
rest
of
the
area
to
mr.
chandler.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
initially,
i
think
what
i
would
like
to
do
is
to
give
some
observations
to
some
of
the
questions
of
this
court
which
were
directed
to
mr.
pollock.
as
to
the
issue
of
standing
to
sue
being
raised
in
this
court,
no
one
has
raised
it.
we
have
considered
that
the
issue
withstanding
to
sue
was
one
of
state
law.
it
relates
to
the
peculiar
problems
and
provision
of
state
law
and
the
interpretation
which
the
state
courts
have
placed
upon
standing
to
sue
and
that
the
decision
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
that
under
these
particular
circumstances,
the
east
greenbush
and
school
board
had
standing
to
sue
that
it
was
foreclosed
from
consideration
in
this
court.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it's
for
one
of
jurisdiction
based
upon
what
we
felt
were
prior
decisions
of
this
court
which
involved
not
a
question
--
it
was
not
a
question
of
standing
the
sue
it
involved
the
merits
of
the
sue
itself.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes
sir.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
pardon
me.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
the
standing
to
sue
which
was
raised
was
standing
to
sue
under
state
law
and
now
a
question
of
the
general
right
of
a
taxpayer
as
may
have
it
raised
in
this
court.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes
but
i
think
that
it
has
been
considered
i
think
by
all
the
parties
in
this
case
if
this
was
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
certainly,
if
this
court
were,
itself,
to
consider
that
standing
to
sue
is
a
problem
of
this
court,
you
certainly
decide
it
on
that
basis.
but
the
issue
that
was
raised
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
i
believe
it
was.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
i
would
assume
that
the
initial
problem
which
raised
their
--
which
started
the
sanction
was
that
the
members
of
the
board
themselves,
felt
that
the
law
was
unconstitutional
both
under
the
state
and
federal
constitutions.
and
that
while
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
as
the
final
arbiter
to
the
state
constitution
provisions
that
they
will
still
consider
that
there
is
a
question
and
a
dilemma
raised
for
them
under
the
federal
constitution
that
if
they
still
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
an
error
as
to
the
federal
constitutional
question
then
and
until
they
got
a
decision
on
the
merits
from
this
court,
they
would
still
be
faced
with
their
own
personal
dilemma
of
either
refusing
to
bail
a
law
which
they
consider
it
to
be
unconstitutional
federally
or
face
the
sanctions
of
the
education
law.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
but
certainly
wipe
out
the
premise
if
they
were
contending
to
accept
the
decision.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
would
wipe
out
that
premise
if
they
are
willing
to
accept
the
decision
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
on
the
issue
of
constitutionality
which
apparently
they
are
not
since
they
are
here.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no
sir
but
they
were
hoping
that
you
will
say
it's
unconstitutional
in
the
federal
constitution
and
since
they
as
public
officials
in
new
york
not
only
to
uphold
the
statement
but
also
the
federal
constitution.
that
would
be
if
they
would
have
an
issue
in
there.
as
to
the
questions
to
who
designates
these
books.
mr.
justice
fortas
question
was
one
that
somewhat
a
surprise
to
us
because
i
don't
think
anyone
in
new
york
has
ever
assume
that
anyone
--
other
than
the
public
school
officials
and
public
school
boards
for
the
final
--
once
we
have
the
control
over
the
designation
of
the
books.
the
terms
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no
sir.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that
is
true.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no,
a
secular
text.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that's
what
the
court
said
and
i
think
this
is
what
the
statute
had
in
mind
because
when
the
--
when
the
statute
said
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes
sir.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
suppose
it
is
but
i
think
we
were
--
this
is
not
what
we
were
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes,
i
think
that
the
attorney
general
has
said
not
sectarian
in
this
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
oh
sir.
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
fortas
that
i
do
not
know
you're
referring
to
that.
the
opinion
of
the
counsel
of
the
education
department
is
not
an
opinion
of
the
attorney
general.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
the
status
of
this
is,
is
that
as
an
opinion
actually
from
our
office,
it's
an
advisory
opinion
only.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
think
that
the
counsel
â€“-
ms.
jean
m.
coon
--
no,
the
counsel
of
the
education
department
like
the
new
york
attorney
general
would
like
very
much
to
have
his
opinions
binding
but
they
are
entered
in
an
advisory
capacity
only.
the
only
authority
that
an
opinion
of
the
counsel
to
the
education
department
has
is
that
it
maybe
supposed
to
represent
the
policy
of
the
education
department
and
the
commissioner
and
therefore
in
a
proceeding
before
the
commissioner
to
appeal
from
a
determination
of
a
local
school
board.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
as
far
as
i
know,
the
opinion
of
the
counsel
--
it's
the
only
thing
approaching
a
rule
of
regulations
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
this
is
not
as
far
as
i
know
that
adopted
as
the
rule
and
regulation
of
the
board.
the
counsel
of
the
education
department
is
of
course
also
accounts
into
the
board
of
regents.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no.
i
believe
that
the
language
of
course
also
refers
to
regulation
to
be
adopted
by
local
school
boards
and
i
think
it
has
been
left
to
the
local
school
boards
within
the
framework
of
the
advisory
opinion
of
the
education
department.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no
sir.
as
far
as
i
know,
there
is
no
compilation
of
these
texts.
they
are
determined
by
individual
school
boards.
each
public
school
board
in
the
state
has
the
authority
to
designate
the
textbooks
to
be
used
in
that
particular
school
district
to
public
school
district
and
they
also,
under
the
statute,
approved
upon
request
of
the
individual
students
to
request
additional
textbooks
which
are
not
authorized
--
already
designated
for
use
in
public
schools
but
may
also
request
that
time
an
additional
book
which
the
board
may
approve
or
may
not
approve
as
it
see
is
fit.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes
sir.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it
would
only
go
to
the
board
of
regents
or
particularly
to
the
commissioner
of
education
if
a
local
taxpayer
in
one
of
the
school
districts
disputed
a
termination
of
the
local
school
board,
possibly
someone
who
objected
to
a
book
which
they
felt
was
sectarian
or
religious
and
nonsectarian
sense.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
can
appeal
to
the
commissioner
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no
sir
except
from
the
framework
of
this
opinion
which
has
been
given.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no
sir.
it
was
handed
down
after
the
original
argument
of
this
case
in
supreme
court
albany
county
but
not
after
the
statute
went
into
operation.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
this
was
an
advice
to
the
school
districts
on
how
they
were
to
go
about
purchasing
the
textbooks,
what
book
are
to
be
involved
and
how
also
you
will
see
in
there
the
process
for
processing
the
reimbursement
provisions.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes
sir.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
he
may
if
it
is
a
textbook
which
he
is
required
to
use
in
a
school.
he
can't
decide
that
some
book
he
seen
in
the
library
would
make
a
good
book
and
bring
to
him
at
home
and
apply
for
that
one.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
but
i
think
that
it
should
be
made
clear
that
the
distinction
here
is
between
these
textbooks
are
by
law
required
to
be
provided
to
the
students
and
not
to
the
schools
they
attend.
and
that
it
is
the
individual
request
of
the
student
which
is
involved
here.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
could
inquire
of
the
education
any
problem
where
there
has
been
any
further
implementation
since
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
refers
to
secular.
as
far
as
i
know,
there
has
not
and
as
far
as
i
also
--
as
far
as
i
know
that
there
have
not
been
any
list
of
what
textbooks
are
involved.
but
i
can
inquire
of
the
department
to
find
out
if
they
have
any
list
but
i
don'
believe
that
they
have.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
don't
know
whether
there
has
been
any
list
promulgated
of
any
textbooks
which
they
consider
subversive
or
not.
i
think
the
question
usually
arises
in
relation
to
a
request
to
the
counsel
of
the
education
department
or
an
opinion
to
whether
or
not
a
particular
textbook
is
permissible
in
use
or
may
arise
an
issue
of
a
taxpayer
bringing
a
proceeding
an
appeal
to
the
commissioner
from
a
determination
of
a
school
board
to
use
a
text
which
they
would
consider
to
be
subversive.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
the
commissioner
of
education.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
the
regents
of
course,
the
commissioner
of
education.
some
of
the
regions
could
adapt
regulations
also
with
the
general
authority
--
administrative
authority
over
the
administration
of
the
education
law
is
in
the
commissioner
of
education.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
as
supervised
by
the
board
of
regents
--
the
board
of
regents
is
a
general
policy
making
organization.
i
don't
think
they
--
as
a
rule,
do
not
get
down
to
the
individual
question.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
oh
yes
sir,
they
would
have
that.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
would
have
authority.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
board
of
regents,
yes
sir.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes
sir.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
say
as
far
as
students
who
are
enrolled
in
the
private
schools
in
new
york
city
as
distinguished
in
public
schools
that
they
could
request
a
textbook
which
might
be
used
in
the
public
schools
or
approved
by
the
public
school
board
of
the
city
of
buffalo
but
has
not
been
approved
or
designated
for
use
in
the
public
schools
in
new
york
city
and
be
entitled
to
receive
it
under
this
law.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
the
new
york
city
school
board
under
those
circumstances.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
from
the
same
publisher,
the
buffalo
buys
it
from.
i
don't
know
to
what
extent
there
is
uniformity
throughout
the
state
in
textbooks
that
are
used
in
the
public
schools.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no
sir.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
believe
it's
something
on
the
line
of
what,
$13
million
or
$14
million
i
think
since
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
no.
i
think
that's
the
total
that
is
total
since
they
program
one
into
effect.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it
works
this
way.
for
the
first
three
years
of
the
statute,
the
local
school
board
was
limited
to
a
requirement
that
it
spend
$15.00
per
pupil
--
not
more
than
$15.00
per
pupil
and
it
was
entitled
to
total
reimbursement
from
the
state
in
that
amount.
the
school
boards
also
had
the
option
to
provided
additional
textbooks.
above
and
beyond
is
$15.00
limit
on
which
they
are
reimbursed
upon
a
reimbursement
formula
which
involves
total
school
expenditures
related
to
the
tax
rolls
of
the
district
and
so
forth
which
amounts
to
something
less
than
total
reimbursement.
in
some
districts,
it
amounts
to
something
less
than
50%
of
their
school
cost
and
others
that
maybe
as
high
as
75%
to
98%
depending
upon
the
economic
status
of
the
district
itself.
the
total
gives
me
the
figures
on
total
textbook
expenditures
in
1966,
â€˜67
for
the
state
was
nineteen
million
and
tow
hundred
and
thirteen
thousand
dollars
and
this
is
the
total
expenditure
so
far
of
the
product
and
it
was
of
course
initially
considered
that
the
initial
expenditures
in
the
first
few
year
would
be
highest
because
of
the
fact
of
the
new
statute
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
the
child
must
return
either
to
the
public
school
district
or
to
a
designated
point
of
storage
for
them
at
the
end
of
each
semester
of
each
school
year.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
devote
the
remaining
time
to
hitting
some
of
the
highlights
or
what
we
believe
are
the
important
things
for
this
court
to
consider
and
to
bear
in
mind
to
decide
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
it
is
the
problem
with
which
new
york
state
was
faced
and
is
facing
in
the
time
when
we
adopted
the
statute.
there
is
an
educational
crisis
developing
not
just
in
new
york
but
in
this
country
as
a
whole
and
it
has
developed
to
the
point
where
not
only
the
local
government
but
also
the
state
and
the
federal
government
are
pouring
immense
amounts
of
money
into
the
school
systems
primarily
to
help
the
educationally
disadvantaged.
the
private
schools
children
who
are
involved
in
this
case
are
not
simply
children
or
parents
who
can
afford
to
send
them
to
tuition
paying
schools.
there
are
among
them
also
the
educationally
disadvantaged.
and
in
this
particular
instance,
new
york
in
deciding
that
it
was
important
that
students
in
the
schools
--
the
school
children
of
the
state
have
available
to
them
up-to-date
textbooks,
consider
the
question
of
not
only
to
provide
them
but
to
whom.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
in
some
cases,
yes.
prior
to
the
enactment
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it's
local
option.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
had
three
options
to
purchase
the
textbooks
and
then
rent
them
to
the
students,
to
sell
them
to
the
students,
to
require
students
to
purchase
their
own
textbooks
or
if
the
voters
of
the
school
district
approved,
the
school
district
could
provide
free
textbooks.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
and
requires
them
to
do
so.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it
should
be
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
before
the
law,
there
were
free
textbooks
in
some
cases
and
not
all.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
say
in
most,
they
probably
were.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
in
new
york
city
they
were.
although
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
we
list
12
of
the
school
districts
which
range
from
small
rural
school
districts
to
those
involving
cities
as
large
as
the
city
of
syracuse
in
which
free
textbooks
were
not
provided
prior
to
this
time
and
in
many
of
those
districts.
there
were
areas
especially
in
the
new
--
area
where
there
have
been
large
packets
of
unemployment
--
large
unemployment
problems.
the
syracuse
area
which
has
been
subjected
to
considerable
in
flow
of
migrants
from
not
only
from
the
south
but
also
from
mining
areas
in
pennsylvania
in
the
appellation
area.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
were
not
provided
and
even
in
public
schools.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
there
was
if
the
voters
of
the
district
would
approve
and
this
was
one
in
which
the
school
board
itself
have
no
control.
this
was
one
solely
within
the
control
of
the
voters
in
the
district.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
let
me
put
it
this
way.
that
certainly
--
any
of
the
school,
the
parochial
school
could
tell
any
students
what
textbooks
it
wanted
them
to
get.
in
other
words,
for
this
particular
course,
you're
going
to
want
x
textbook.
and
the
school
child
then
can
fill
in
a
form
which
he
request
this
of
a
public
school
district.
now,
the
public
school
district
then
has
two
options.
one,
if
this
is
a
book
which
has
been
designated
for
use
â€“
ms.
jean
m.
coon
designated
for
use
in
the
public
schools
by
the
public
school
board
and
then
there's
no
problem
about
the
student
getting
the
book.
if
it
is
not
then
the
public
school
district,
the
board
of
education
district
has
under
this
law
the
option
to
approve
or
not
to
approve
that
book.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
but
they
could
approve
it
and
then
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
they
could
in
those
courses
which
would
be
not
religion
course.
it's
not
teaching
religion.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
in
those
courses
which
did
not
teach
religion,
yes.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
assuming
also
this
would
be
only
for
grade
7
through
12,
in
other
words
junior
and
senior
high
schools.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
yes
sir.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
our
statutory
definition
is
while
the
statutory
definition
if
you
take
the
preamble
of
the
statute,
it
refers
to
nonsectarian
textbooks
but
i
think
this
has
been
interpreted
in
the
court
of
appeals
has
interpreted
all
of
these
to
require
secular
textbooks
in
that
regard.
so
that
to
the
extent
that
over
a
course
of
time,
it's
been
highly
possible
that
within
the
range
of
a
statute
be
--
with
the
exception
of
courses
teaching
religion
that
the
parochial
school
children
could
get
all
of
their
textbooks
in
grade
7
through
12.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that
maybe.
what
raises
problems
is
of
course
is
to
what
they
would
use
these
books
for.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it
might
have
some
problem
else,
along
the
same
lines
of
course
is
the
question
of
a
tuition
allowance
which
was
raised
in
vermont
i
believe
which
the
students
were
--
people
are
using
this
to
attend
the
religious
schools.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
that
if
this
is
--
if
this
we're
going
to
go
in
that
matter.
now,
of
course
one
of
the
things
with
g.i.
bill
the
same
thing
with
new
york
scholar
and
set
a
program,
these
are
open
to
all
students
unlike
without
regard
to
where
they
go.
the
same
situation
here,
the
textbooks
are
available
to
all
children
regardless
of
the
school
they
attend
and
in
that
regard,
it
is
not
a
--
it
is
a
law
which
does
not
discriminate
between
the
religion
and
not
religion
between
the
sectarian
and
nonsectarian
schools.
it
is
neutral
as
between
--
not
only
as
between
religions
but
it
is
between
religion
and
non-religion.
how
we
think
to
that
extent,
it
means
to
test
them
and
lay
down
by
this
court
in
cases
like
everson
and
some
of
the
others.
and
also
of
course
is
i
would
bring
out
the
secular
purpose
of
providing
this
means
of
educating
a
child,
excess
of
the
child
through
education
material
in
the
sense
of
a
textbook.
to
children
regardless
of
their
--
the
school
they
attend
that
this
is
a
purpose
within
--
what
was
in
the
sunday
closing
cases
for
example
is
a
purpose
which
is
secular
in
origin
and
it
is
a
primary
purpose
of
aide
to
the
school
child
in
this
particular
case
of
helping
him
to
get
a
better
secular
education
and
not
an
education
sectarian
or
religious
subjects
but
in
those
subjects
which
he
needs
to
enjoy
and
to
further
his
competitive
advantage
economically
as
he
gets
older
and
gets
out
of
school.
the
problem
has
been
pointed
out
and
we've
pointed
out
in
our
brief.
the
problem
of
a
child
from
an
economically
disadvantage
family
with
several
children
in
school
and
maybe
required
to
spend
$15.00
to
$20.00
per
child
in
purchasing
textbook
but
they
don't
have
a
their
set
money
for
their
necessities
of
life.
they
certainly
don't
have
the
money
to
spend
on
textbook
and
this
maybe
a
cause
of
a
child
dropping
out
of
school.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
refers
to
nonsectarian
subjects
in
schools.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
it's
quoted
on
page
20
of
our
brief
at
one
point
anyway.
and
it
refers
to
the
--
the
term
by
the
correcting
of
education
on
balances
which
have
read
to
an
insufficient
portion
of
our
population
educating
the
field
of
science,
mathematics,
foreign
language
and
other
nonsectarian
subjects.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
now,
i
think
this
is
--
we
have
to
read
the
preamble
in
line
with
what
has
been
--
what
was
said
in
the
statute
itself
about
the
approval
of
the
books
and
so
forth
and
this
has
been
interpreted.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
the
statute
talks
--
ms.
jean
m.
coon
well,
the
statute
refers
to
textbooks.
it's
cited
at
page
--
let's
see,
1(a)
of
the
appellant's
brief.
ms.
jean
m.
coon
i
would
say
this
justice
fortas
that
if
in
a
relation
here
that
the
use
of
the
words
here
textbooks
which
are
designated
for
use
in
any
public
elementary
or
secondary
schools
of
the
state
are
approve
by
any
boards
of
education
trustees
or
the
school
authorities,
meaning
public
school
authorities
that
this
has
been
interpreted
by
the
administrative
agencies
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
--
new
york
court
of
appeals,
to
mean
only
secular
textbooks,
in
other
words,
nonreligious
textbooks.
i
think
on
this
basis,
i
think
will
leave
the
rest
of
the
area
to
mr.
chandler.
