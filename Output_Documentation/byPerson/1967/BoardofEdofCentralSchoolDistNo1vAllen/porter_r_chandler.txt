mr.
porter
r.
chandler
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
picking
up
for
a
moment
what
mrs.
coon
has
just
said,
the
question
that
mr.
justice
fortas
has
been
concerned
about.
the
statute
does
not
say
specifically
what
kind
of
books
they
are
to
be
but
the
statute
has
been
conclusively
construed
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
as
requiring
secular
textbooks
and
that
interpretation
arises
out
of
the
long
history
of
new
york
under
which
public
schools
are
not
supposed
to
teach
religion
and
are
supposed
to
confine
themselves
to
secular
education.
i
must
remind
the
court
also
that
this
case
comes
here
on
an
attack
on
the
whole
statute
without
regard
to
its
administration,
without
regard
to
particular
books,
the
position
of
opposing
counsel
is
quite
flat
that
this
statute
is
bad
on
its
face.
it
is
so
bad
that
no
amount
of
good
administration
could
make
it
better
or
save
it.
it
is
so
bad
that
no
amount
of
maladministration
could
make
it
worse
and
there
is
no
distinction
raised
between
this
book
and
that
book
in
our
friend's
complaint.
the
attack
is
on
all
books
and
the
secular
definition
comes
out
of
the
long
experience
of
new
york
which
is
taken
for
granted
that
the
public
schools
should
not
teach
religion
and
should
not
buy
religious
books.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
that's
right
but
the
theme
of
this
law
is
that
the
book
that
are
to
be
provided
are
books
uphold
by
public
school
authorities
on
the
same
standard
that
the
public
schools
have
been
using
for
a
long
time.
take
the
illustration
that
one
of
the
other
judges
may
have
mentioned
a
particular
school
district,
let
us
suppose
somewhere,
goes
crazy
and
decides
they
want
to
put
a
course
of
religion.
in
the
public
schools
and
take
a
district
where
there
is
no
private
school
in
the
area.
the
public
school
district
decides,
we
will
have
religious
courses
in
the
public
schools
and
they
start
ordering
religious
books.
that
immediate
result
would
be
that
any
taxpayer
in
the
district
could
stop
it
by
a
court
proceeding.
if
you
didn't
like
a
court
proceeding,
you
could
stop
it
by
an
appeal
to
the
commissioner
of
education
and
the
commissioner
of
education
has
very
broad
powers
of
the
school
districts.
he
has
not
hesitated
to
use
them
in
the
field
of
religion.
let
me
give
you
a
couple
of
instances.
the
commissioner
of
education
of
new
york
on
his
own
authority
banned
the
on
premises
release
time,
religious
education
before
this
court
ever
had
the
mccollum
case
following
engel
versus
vitale,
the
commissioner
of
education
took
very
strong
action
on
so
called
religious
practices.
he
even
forbid
the
use
in
the
public
schools
of
the
last
stanza
of
the
stars
spangled
banner
when
it
was
being
sang
under
circumstances
that
gave
it
a
religious
rather
than
a
patriotic
connotation
so
that
the
idea
that
a
particular
school
district
is
to
act
as
a
rubber
stamp
for
parochial
school
and
order
all
kinds
of
religious
textbooks
is
an
idea
--
a
divorce
from
reality
and
divorce
from
the
practicality
of
the
situation
that
any
such
action
would
be
amount
claim
a
piece
of
maladministration
under
the
act
and
it
would
be
very
instantly
crack
down
upon
by
the
commissioner
or
by
the
new
york
courts.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yeah,
i'm
glad
your
honor
asked
that
question.
i
represent
the
group
of
parents
in
this
district.
there
are
joint
intervening
affidavit
which
is
in
the
record
that
states
without
contradiction
that
each
of
these
parents
was
paying
out
of
his
own
pocket
for
the
textbooks
that
were
used
in
the
school
where
this
child
is
attending.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
there's
no
evidence
or
claim
that
that
happens
anywhere
in
the
state.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
don't
think
it
would
--
i
think
it
would
be
a
matter
of
--
well,
first
of
speculations
of
facts
not
shown
on
this
record
and
i
suppose
that
if
a
public
school
--
i
would
say
that
if
a
public
school,
a
parochial
school
had
been
furnishing
textbooks
to
children
that
the
children
in
that
school
would
still
be
covered
by
this
law
and
would
be
entitled
to
get
it.
i
am
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
would
say
it
was
valid
but
i
add
that
in
this
particular
case
and
as
far
as
we
know
towards
the
general
practice
throughout
the
state
has
been
that
the
parent
individually
pays
the
bill
for
the
textbooks.
it's
un-contradicted
on
this
record
that
that
is
the
situation.
now,
questions
asked
earlier
in
the
argument,
i
think
had
been
laid
at
rest,
the
language
of
the
statute
about
other
approval
by
other
school
authorities.
i
emphasize
that
school
authorities
is
a
word
of
art.
it
has
been
specifically
defined
in
section
2
of
the
education
law
which
covers
all
succeeding
sections.
may
i
have
that
section?
i'll
read
it
again.
the
term
school
authorities
means
the
trustees
or
a
board
of
education
or
corresponding
officers
whether
one
or
more
and
by
whatever
name
known
of
a
city
school
district
or
other
school
district,
however,
created
plainly
a
reference
to
public
authorities
and
the
reason
they
have
that
catchall
phrase
is
because
in
new
york,
we
have
a
number
of
school
districts
with
a
vastly
varying
terminology.
we
have
urban
school
districts,
we
have
rural
school
districts,
we
have
united
school
districts,
we
have
common
school
districts,
we
have
high
school
districts
and
a
whole
series
of
districts
with
various
names
and
this
catchall
phrase
refers
to
authorities
of
a
school
district
however
created.
we
have
special
situations
for
example
a
reform
school.
in
a
reform
school,
the
superintendent
of
the
school
is
vested
by
law
with
the
powers
of
the
local
board
of
education.
he
is
the
board
of
education
for
a
reform
school,
the
same
thing
with
other
school
for
handicapped
and
so
on.
the
terminology
in
new
york
is
greatly
confused
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes
it
is.
i
think
yes
it
is.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
there's
a
school
district
with
widely
varying
terminology
covering
the
entire
state,
yes.
there
are
school
district,
there's
not
one
--
all
districts
under
the
supervision
of
the
board
of
regents.
sorry,
i
mislaid
one
piece
of
notes.
now,
as
to
the
question
--
as
to
the
list
of
books
as
mrs.
coon
pointed
out
the
basic
fact
to
new
york
state
is
that
there
is
not
a
statewide
approved
list.
the
list
of
books
depends
upon
the
particular
district.
perhaps,
the
most
all
embracing
one
is
the
official
list
that
has
been
got
out
by
the
city
of
new
york
that's
referred
to
in
our
brief
and
some
illustrations
are
given
and
it
would
be
of
any
concern
or
interest
to
the
court.
i
can
have
copies
of
the
new
york
list
furnished.
that
is
a
very
widespread
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
no
sir,
i
don't.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
your
honor,
this
is
the
public
school
list
--
what
percentage.
this
is
the
list
of
books
prescribed
by
the
new
york
public
school
board
for
use
in
the
public
schools
--
for
use
in
the
public
schools
of
new
york.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
the
parochial
schools
i
think
in
almost
every
instance
withdraw
from
that
list
unless
there
were
some
very
special
reason.
now,
the
reason,
among
the
reasons
by
the
way
for
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
this
is
the
list
from
which
any
local
school
board
of
new
york
can
order
and
from
which
by
the
same
token,
any
local
parochial
schools
stood
in
order
and
it
will
be
approved
automatically
without
checking
to
see
whether
the
book
is
on
the
list
and
a
mention
is
made
at
page
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
if
the
list.
if
the
book
--
there
is
no
special
parochial
school
list
that
the
parochial
school
felt
that
it
wanted
some
books
that
might
not
be
on
that
list.
it
could
ask
for
them.
the
local
school
board
would
then
decide
whether
to
approve
it
or
not
and
the
local
school
board
would
have
as
one
major
guideline
is
the
book
a
secular
book
or
does
it
have
any
religious
training
in
it.
illustrations
of
why
a
local
school
board
books
might
not
be
required
--
might
not
precisely
fit
on
parochial
school
with
this.
let's
suppose
the
only
local
public
high
school
in
the
district
has
classes
in
french
but
not
in
german.
the
parochial
high
school
would
like
to
get
german
textbooks.
the
next
school
district
up
the
line
where
the
public
high
school
does
teach
german
will
have
german
books.
what
would
be
more
natural
or
easier
than
for
the
public
school
book
--
private
school
pupils
to
say
that
we
like
the
german
books
that
are
used
up
to
the
line,
you
haven't
got
any
available
here.
the
obligation
to
furnish
the
books
is
on
the
--
another
reason.
the
obligation
to
furnish
books
is
on
the
district
in
which
the
child
resides
not
on
the
district
where
he
goes
to
school.
that
is
illustrated
in
the
cases
of
my
client's
children.
they
leave
in
east
greenbush.
there
is
no
catholic
high
school
in
east
greenbush.
those
are
my
clients
children
and
there
are
a
couple
of
them
who
are
going
to
catholic
high
schools,
consequently,
have
to
go
to
the
next
district
which
maybe
either
across
the
river
to
albany
or
to
the
town
of
rensselaer
and
they
go
--
they
will
want
high
school
books
corresponding
to
the
ones
that
are
used
in
the
public
schools
in
albany
and
rensselaer,
the
districts
which
they
attend
school
which
is
not
necessarily
the
same
district
in
which
they
reside
and
there's
the
district
in
which
they
reside
that
has
the
obligation
to
furnishing
the
books.
the
approval
of
other
school
authorities
by
the
way,
i
advice
one
reason
why
i've
got
into
that
statute
in
the
term
of
what
it
did
was
that
the
draftsman
of
the
new
york
statute
wanted
to
conform
the
language
to
the
contemporaneously
enacted
federal
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
which
presents
problems
quite
analogous
to
this
and
your
honors
will
find
them
that
rather
the
luminous
pile
of
briefs
before
you,
a
brief
fro
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
dealing
with
this
case
and
its
relation
to
some
extent
with
title
ii
of
the
federal
act
which
also
provides
textbook
of
service
for
children
in
all
schools.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes
sir.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
think
they
could
provide
it
and
certified
as
passing
the
test
of
not
being
a
religious
book
and
not
having
religious
connotations
in
it.
it
couldn't
be
a
so
called
catholic
edition
with
an
“imprimatur”
or
anything
of
that
sort
and
if
the
local
school
board
felt
that
it
was
not
within
the
secular
definition,
it
would
not
only
have
the
right
but
the
duty
to
refuse
to
buy
it.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
get
what
sir?
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
can
only
say
that
i
don't
know.
i
haven't
been
faced
with
that.among
my
responsibilities
is
not
that
of
the
member
of
board
of
education.
i
do
have
other
educational.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
don't
have
it
in
the
record
but
i
can
answer
the
question.
and
before
doing
that,
i
wanted
to
point
out
one
other
very
important
factor.
there
are
of
course
here
three
classes
of
schools
that
are
enrolled
and
we
mustn't
forget
the
three
classes.
they
are
the
public
schools,
there
are
the
private
schools
that
do
not
teach
religion
and
there
are
the
private
schools
that
do
teach
religion
and
the
attack
on
constitutionality
here
is
based
solely
on
the
furnishing
of
books
to
the
third
class
of
students.
there
is
no
objection
in
furnishing
them
free
in
the
public
schools.
there
is
no
objection
to
furnishing
them
free
to
children
in
the
private
schools
so
long
as
the
private
school
doesn't
teach
religion.
i
think
i
have
my
statistics
here.
i
can
answer
that.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
what's
that?
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
your
honors
have
that
case
on
the
docket
for
later
on
in
this
term
i
believe.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i'm
teaching
the
darwinian
theory?
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
think
the
board
of
regents
would
probably
provide
it.
again,
i
don't
speak
for
them.
they
could
order
the
darwinian
or
the
twine
b
theory
i
think
that
parochial
or
private
schools
can
get
buy
that
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
mrs.
coon.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
mrs.--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
no
sir.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
mrs.
coon
represents
the
commissioner
of
education
who
is
the
record
defendant
in
this
case.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
the
commissioner
of
education
is
the
administrative
arm
of
the
board
of
regents.
he
is
appointed
and
removable
by
the
regents.
the
regents
under
new
york
law
are
the
head
of
the
education
department.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
no
because
the
relief
could
be
obtain
fully
against
their
executive
official
by
the
commissioner.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
what's
that?
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
see.
i
was
trying
to
find
my
figures
on
--
there
are
as
i
recalled
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
there
are
about
1400
religious
schools
throughout
the
state
of
various
denominations.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
among
religions?
i
have
to
figure
here
somewhere
and
i
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
call
it
presbyterian
and
i
am
not--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
there
are
several
religious
--
find
that
somewhere
in
this
book.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes
sir.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
in
the
record
of
sir?
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes,
i
would
like
to
elaborate
on
that.
the
figures
that
i
have
is
of
schools,
roman
catholic
1445,
jewish
135
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
jewish
135,
lutheran
57,
episcopalian
48,
seventh-day
adventist
45,
other
religion
and
that
includes
quakers,
mennonites,
eastern
orthodox
and
methodist,
other
religions,
11
and
non-religiously
affiliated
246
of
which
204
have
children
who
are
getting
textbooks
under
this
program
that
is
of
the
non-religiously
affiliated
private
schools.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
204
out
of
246
non-religiously
affiliated
schools
are
having
their
children
get
books.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
1445
your
honor.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
have
gone
at
some
length
into
my
brief
on
the
extent
of
state
control
over
these
schools
and
i
think
that
might
answer
your
honor's
question.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
when
i
get
through
perhaps
because
i
haven't
done
something
further.
all
education,
public
and
private
in
new
york
state
is
under
the
very
broad
powers
of
the
regents.
their
basic
statute
describes
them
as
having
legislative
functions.
they
are
--
they
rule
over
institution
which
is
highly
misnamed
as
the
university
of
the
state
of
new
york.
now
the
university
of
the
state
of
new
york
has
been
in
existence
since
1784,
no
campus,
no
students,
nothing
that
an
ordinary
university
has.
it
is
by
definition
includes
all
the
educational
institutions
public
and
private
within
the
state
and
such
allied
institutions
is
libraries
and
so
forth.
the
schools
have
to
be
charted
by
the
board
of
regents.
there
are
subject
of
hesitation
by
the
regents.
catholic
schools
have
to
be
charted
by
the
regents.
they
are
subject
to
visitation
by
the
regents.
the
curriculum
as
described
in
great
detail.perhaps
the
most
startling
illustration
that
i
can
give
you
your
honor
is
this.
these
students
and
let
us
say
a
catholic
school.
they
draw
down
these
books
from
the
publics
--
of
the
public
school
tithe
and
they
use
them
to
study
courses
prescribed
by
the
regents.
when
they
get
through
--
i'm
referring
to
pupils
in
a
catholic
school.
they
take
an
examination.
who
sets
the
examination?
the
regents.
if
they
pass,
they
get
a
diploma.
whose
diploma
do
they
get?
the
diploma
signed
by
church
authorities?
no.
they
get
a
diploma
in
the
name
of
the
university
of
the
state
of
new
york
bearing
the
seal
of
the
education
department
signed
by
the
commissioner
of
education.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
except
theological
schools.
no,
i
was
talking
about
high
schools.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
was
talking
about
high
school
diplomas.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
a
catholic
high
school
board
if
it
passes
an
examination
set
by
the
regents
and
he
gets
a
regents
diploma
and
the
sample
of
it
is
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
well
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
the
minority
in
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
that
it
might
in
the
long
run
secularize
education
in
the
parochial
schools
by
getting
parochial
school
parents
accustomed
to
using
secular
books
instead
of
the
religiously
oriented
books
they
would
have
been
suppose
to
be
using
otherwise.
that
is
not
a
danger
of
which
we
are
conscious
and
that
it
doesn't
fit
very
well
with
the
theory
of
my
friend.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
my
brother
pollock
talks
about
the
parochial
school
being
practically
a
seminary
of
religion
and
nothing
else.
he
talks
about
permeation
and
all
that
and
that
doesn't
seem
to
fit
very
well
with
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
that
a
danger
as
they
view
it,
of
the
statute
will
be
that
it
will
be
un-permeated.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
either
the
danger
is
highly
speculating.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
what?
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes
and
the
business
which
my
friend
is
also
raised
in
his
brief
about
being
no
way
of
distinguishing
between
the
secular
and
the
religious
in
the
text
would
cast
out
on
the
whole
theory
of
education
even
in
the
public
school.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
no.
they
prescribed
and
brought
outlines
and
in
some
detail
it
has
been
form
with
the
instruction.
the
regulations
know
in
our
brief
and
for
that
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
what
did
you
say
sir?
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
would
not
think
they
were
anti-religious.
i
would
not
think
they
are
pro-religious.
but
the
examination
and
let
us
say
a
boy
in
the
methodist
high
school
would
take
the
regent's
examination.
it
would
be
the
same
examination
that
is
given
to
a
boy
in
a
public
school
and
to
a
boy
in
a
catholic.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
think
they
would
probably
say
that
the
book
must
be
highly
neutral
or
else
not
on
the
list
at
all.
that's
the
problem
they
have
to
confront
with
public
schools.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
you
got
--
well,
may
i
ask
your
honor
this
question
back.
what
kind
of
a
book
would
be
allowed
for
use
in
the
public
school
teaching
the
reformation?
and
the
answer
i
think
is
whatever
kind
of
book
they
find
as
sufficiently
neutral
on
that
subject
to
use
in
the
public
school
would
be
alright
to
use
in
the
private
schools
and
i
think
that's
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
no.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
if
i
haven't
answered
mr.
justice
black's
question.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
the
basic
purpose
of
religious
school
is
to
give
an
adequate
secular
education
plus
religious
instruction
and
the
fact
that
it
was
given
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
get
out
from
what
sir?
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
but
they
have
to
meet
the
secular
requirements
laid
down
to
the
state
or
they
can't
exist.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
it
doesn't
immediately
come
to
my
mind
just
what
there
is
but
i
will
look
and
see.
i
could
try.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
will
sir.
but
i
bear
in
mind
that
they
have
to
fill
this
--
the
private
--
the
secular
standards
of
the
state.
i
see
that
the
light
is
on
and
i
shall
not
discuss
our
cases
fully
discussed
in
our
brief.
we
think
this
case
is
completely
alright
under
the
everson
test
which
we
accept
fully
and
i
agree
with
the
chief
justice
in
all
submission
that
there's
no
difference
in
the
facts
between
everson
and
this
and
in
line
with
the
test
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
well,
i
beg
your
pardon.
he
asked
my
friend
whether
there
was
any
difference.
i
beg
your
pardon.
well,
i
submit
there
is
no
basic
difference.
everson
did
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
and
i
don't
think
there's
anything
ideological
about
a
book
called
hallet's
machine
shop
practice
which
is
one
of
the
books
that
is
approved
for
use
in
the
public
schools
of
new
york
and
which
probably
becomes
bad
the
minute
it
is
used
by
a
parochial
school
student.
i'd
like
to
take
just
two
minutes
remaining.
my
friends
have
talked
about
the
establishment
clause.
they
did
not
raise
the
free
exercise
clause
in
their
complaint
below
at
all.
they
have
raised
in
their
brief
here
and
in
closing,
i
simply
want
to
remind
the
court
of
the
fact
that
what
they
are
seeking
to
do
is
to
single
out
that
the
bar
from
the
benefits
of
this
one
--
of
this
broad
general
welfare
statute,
one
particular
class
of
children
and
to
bar
them
on
the
ground,
the
sole
ground
of
the
religious
nature
of
the
school
which
they
attend.
i
suggest
that
the
only
free
exercise
question
involved
in
this
case
is
the
free
exercise
question
which
they
have
raised
by
such
a
type
of
discrimination
and
which
runs
squarely
into
the
language
of
everson
that
the
court
in
regarding
against
the
establishment
clauses
must
see
to
it
that
it
does
not
prevent
a
state
from
extending
the
benefits
of
a
broad
general
welfare
statute
to
all
people
whether
they
be
mohammed,
lutherans,
jews
or
others.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
no
sir.
my
position
is
this
and
i
have
authority
for
this
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
no
sir.
i
think
--
i
must
clear
that
out.
i
take
the
line
that
the
court
took
in
everson,
the
state
can
if
it
wishes
confine
the
benefits
to
public
school
children.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
the
court
said
in
everson
that
that
could
be
done
but
then
i
say
that
if
the
court
goes
outside
there
as
it
did
here
and
extends
the
benefit
to
all
children
then
there's
always
carrying
it
to
all
children
that
cannot
exclude
one
particular
task,
the
religious
ones
and
while
still
going
on
to
give
the
same
books
to
show
the
attending
non-religious
private
schools.
the
new
jersey
statute
would
have
been
plainly
wrong
if
it
said,
buses
are
alright
for
children
going
to
public
schools
and
to
private
schools
as
long
as
they
don't
teach
religion.
the
statute
would
be
all
wrong
if
each
had
buses
maybe
descent,
buses
maybe
used
or
books
maybe
used
to
children
in
public
schools
and
parochial
schools
leaving
out
the
private
ones.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
rely
very
much
so
on
sherbet
v.
verner
and
i
cited
in
that
section
of
our
brief.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
wouldn't
--
by
providing
it
only
for
public
schools.
i
wasn't
taken
out
sir
under
the
everson
doctrine
and
i
don't
think
that
sherbet
would
affect
that.
i
think
new
york's
actions
quite
constitutional.
incidentally,
one
more
thing
that
i
forgot
to
mention,
to
correct
the
new
york
law
as
it
was
before
1935,
new
york
did
have
a
law
in
1934
which
provided
free
textbooks
for
everybody
along
with
transportation,
clothing
and
shoes,
provided
that
the
child's
parents
were
indigent
and
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
handed
down
an
opinion
that
that
applied
to
parochial
school
children.
so
if
my
friend
is
correct
and
if
he
wins
here,
he
will
stricken
out
the
provision
of
the
1965
act
but
left
the
1934
one
standing
so
that
according
to
that
construction,
a
child
who
goes
to
a
public
school
gets
free
books
whether
he
is
rich
or
poor.
a
child
who
goes
to
a
private
school
that
doesn't
teach
religion
gets
free
books
whether
he
is
rich
or
poor.
a
child
that
goes
to
a
religious
school
will
go
on
getting
free
books
provided
that
he
can
prove
that
his
family
is
on
relief.
in
that
i
submit
rather
serious
questions
of
equal
protection
and
free
exercise.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
your
honor,
i
don't
think
i
can
generalize
on
hypothetical
statute
that
against
the
background
of
necessities
or
judgments
that
i
cannot
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
it's
been
--
argument
about
mathematics.
they
may
well
be
a
distinction
but
my
only
answer
to
that
would
be
that
when
you're
faced
to
the
facts
in
that
situation,
the
thing
is
to
see
whether
it
squares
with
the
dual
test
that
this
court
laid
down
in
schemp.
a
primary
secular
purpose
that
in
effect
which
neither
advances
nor
inhibits
religion,
if
it
meets
that
test
as
we
think
this
program
does
then
it
would
be
alright.
i
would
find
it
difficult
--
i
would
find
it
difficult
to
express
an
opinion
your
honor
without
knowing
all
the
facts.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
if
they
say
all
the
church
schools
in
new
york,
i
would
think
that
that
would
raise
a
very
serious
question
it
would
have
to
be
a
program
as
this
one
is
for
all
children
in
all
schools
whether
they're
church
schools
or
public
schools
or
other.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
what
did
you
say
sir?
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
no
sir.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
all
schools
which
make
the
compulsory
education
law
--
if
that
includes
church
schools
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
sir,
the
statute
provides
free
book
to
all
children
and
all
schools
submit
the
compulsory
education
law.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
there
are
three
classes
of
such
schools.
there
are
the
public
schools,
there
are
the
private
schools
that
don't
teach
religion
and
it's
still
complying
with
the
compulsory
education
law,
and
there
are
the
private
schools
that
do
teach
religion.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
that
is
the
only
attack
that
is
being
made
here.
the
statute
--
my
friend
is
attacking
only
the
distribution
of
books
to
children
in
church
schools.
he
is
not
attacking
the
delivery
of
such
books
to
children
in
other
private
schools.
that
i
say
raises
a
very
serious
question
under
equal
protection
and
the
free
exercise
religion.
i
hope
i
made
myself
clear.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
picking
up
for
a
moment
what
mrs.
coon
has
just
said,
the
question
that
mr.
justice
fortas
has
been
concerned
about.
the
statute
does
not
say
specifically
what
kind
of
books
they
are
to
be
but
the
statute
has
been
conclusively
construed
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
as
requiring
secular
textbooks
and
that
interpretation
arises
out
of
the
long
history
of
new
york
under
which
public
schools
are
not
supposed
to
teach
religion
and
are
supposed
to
confine
themselves
to
secular
education.
i
must
remind
the
court
also
that
this
case
comes
here
on
an
attack
on
the
whole
statute
without
regard
to
its
administration,
without
regard
to
particular
books,
the
position
of
opposing
counsel
is
quite
flat
that
this
statute
is
bad
on
its
face.
it
is
so
bad
that
no
amount
of
good
administration
could
make
it
better
or
save
it.
it
is
so
bad
that
no
amount
of
maladministration
could
make
it
worse
and
there
is
no
distinction
raised
between
this
book
and
that
book
in
our
friend's
complaint.
the
attack
is
on
all
books
and
the
secular
definition
comes
out
of
the
long
experience
of
new
york
which
is
taken
for
granted
that
the
public
schools
should
not
teach
religion
and
should
not
buy
religious
books.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
that's
right
but
the
theme
of
this
law
is
that
the
book
that
are
to
be
provided
are
books
uphold
by
public
school
authorities
on
the
same
standard
that
the
public
schools
have
been
using
for
a
long
time.
take
the
illustration
that
one
of
the
other
judges
may
have
mentioned
a
particular
school
district,
let
us
suppose
somewhere,
goes
crazy
and
decides
they
want
to
put
a
course
of
religion.
in
the
public
schools
and
take
a
district
where
there
is
no
private
school
in
the
area.
the
public
school
district
decides,
we
will
have
religious
courses
in
the
public
schools
and
they
start
ordering
religious
books.
that
immediate
result
would
be
that
any
taxpayer
in
the
district
could
stop
it
by
a
court
proceeding.
if
you
didn't
like
a
court
proceeding,
you
could
stop
it
by
an
appeal
to
the
commissioner
of
education
and
the
commissioner
of
education
has
very
broad
powers
of
the
school
districts.
he
has
not
hesitated
to
use
them
in
the
field
of
religion.
let
me
give
you
a
couple
of
instances.
the
commissioner
of
education
of
new
york
on
his
own
authority
banned
the
on
premises
release
time,
religious
education
before
this
court
ever
had
the
mccollum
case
following
engel
versus
vitale,
the
commissioner
of
education
took
very
strong
action
on
so
called
religious
practices.
he
even
forbid
the
use
in
the
public
schools
of
the
last
stanza
of
the
stars
spangled
banner
when
it
was
being
sang
under
circumstances
that
gave
it
a
religious
rather
than
a
patriotic
connotation
so
that
the
idea
that
a
particular
school
district
is
to
act
as
a
rubber
stamp
for
parochial
school
and
order
all
kinds
of
religious
textbooks
is
an
idea
--
a
divorce
from
reality
and
divorce
from
the
practicality
of
the
situation
that
any
such
action
would
be
amount
claim
a
piece
of
maladministration
under
the
act
and
it
would
be
very
instantly
crack
down
upon
by
the
commissioner
or
by
the
new
york
courts.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yeah,
i'm
glad
your
honor
asked
that
question.
i
represent
the
group
of
parents
in
this
district.
there
are
joint
intervening
affidavit
which
is
in
the
record
that
states
without
contradiction
that
each
of
these
parents
was
paying
out
of
his
own
pocket
for
the
textbooks
that
were
used
in
the
school
where
this
child
is
attending.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
there's
no
evidence
or
claim
that
that
happens
anywhere
in
the
state.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
don't
think
it
would
--
i
think
it
would
be
a
matter
of
--
well,
first
of
speculations
of
facts
not
shown
on
this
record
and
i
suppose
that
if
a
public
school
--
i
would
say
that
if
a
public
school,
a
parochial
school
had
been
furnishing
textbooks
to
children
that
the
children
in
that
school
would
still
be
covered
by
this
law
and
would
be
entitled
to
get
it.
i
am
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
would
say
it
was
valid
but
i
add
that
in
this
particular
case
and
as
far
as
we
know
towards
the
general
practice
throughout
the
state
has
been
that
the
parent
individually
pays
the
bill
for
the
textbooks.
it's
un-contradicted
on
this
record
that
that
is
the
situation.
now,
questions
asked
earlier
in
the
argument,
i
think
had
been
laid
at
rest,
the
language
of
the
statute
about
other
approval
by
other
school
authorities.
i
emphasize
that
school
authorities
is
a
word
of
art.
it
has
been
specifically
defined
in
section
2
of
the
education
law
which
covers
all
succeeding
sections.
may
i
have
that
section?
i'll
read
it
again.
the
term
school
authorities
means
the
trustees
or
a
board
of
education
or
corresponding
officers
whether
one
or
more
and
by
whatever
name
known
of
a
city
school
district
or
other
school
district,
however,
created
plainly
a
reference
to
public
authorities
and
the
reason
they
have
that
catchall
phrase
is
because
in
new
york,
we
have
a
number
of
school
districts
with
a
vastly
varying
terminology.
we
have
urban
school
districts,
we
have
rural
school
districts,
we
have
united
school
districts,
we
have
common
school
districts,
we
have
high
school
districts
and
a
whole
series
of
districts
with
various
names
and
this
catchall
phrase
refers
to
authorities
of
a
school
district
however
created.
we
have
special
situations
for
example
a
reform
school.
in
a
reform
school,
the
superintendent
of
the
school
is
vested
by
law
with
the
powers
of
the
local
board
of
education.
he
is
the
board
of
education
for
a
reform
school,
the
same
thing
with
other
school
for
handicapped
and
so
on.
the
terminology
in
new
york
is
greatly
confused
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes
it
is.
i
think
yes
it
is.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
there's
a
school
district
with
widely
varying
terminology
covering
the
entire
state,
yes.
there
are
school
district,
there's
not
one
--
all
districts
under
the
supervision
of
the
board
of
regents.
sorry,
i
mislaid
one
piece
of
notes.
now,
as
to
the
question
--
as
to
the
list
of
books
as
mrs.
coon
pointed
out
the
basic
fact
to
new
york
state
is
that
there
is
not
a
statewide
approved
list.
the
list
of
books
depends
upon
the
particular
district.
perhaps,
the
most
all
embracing
one
is
the
official
list
that
has
been
got
out
by
the
city
of
new
york
that's
referred
to
in
our
brief
and
some
illustrations
are
given
and
it
would
be
of
any
concern
or
interest
to
the
court.
i
can
have
copies
of
the
new
york
list
furnished.
that
is
a
very
widespread
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
no
sir,
i
don't.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
your
honor,
this
is
the
public
school
list
--
what
percentage.
this
is
the
list
of
books
prescribed
by
the
new
york
public
school
board
for
use
in
the
public
schools
--
for
use
in
the
public
schools
of
new
york.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
the
parochial
schools
i
think
in
almost
every
instance
withdraw
from
that
list
unless
there
were
some
very
special
reason.
now,
the
reason,
among
the
reasons
by
the
way
for
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
this
is
the
list
from
which
any
local
school
board
of
new
york
can
order
and
from
which
by
the
same
token,
any
local
parochial
schools
stood
in
order
and
it
will
be
approved
automatically
without
checking
to
see
whether
the
book
is
on
the
list
and
a
mention
is
made
at
page
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
if
the
list.
if
the
book
--
there
is
no
special
parochial
school
list
that
the
parochial
school
felt
that
it
wanted
some
books
that
might
not
be
on
that
list.
it
could
ask
for
them.
the
local
school
board
would
then
decide
whether
to
approve
it
or
not
and
the
local
school
board
would
have
as
one
major
guideline
is
the
book
a
secular
book
or
does
it
have
any
religious
training
in
it.
illustrations
of
why
a
local
school
board
books
might
not
be
required
--
might
not
precisely
fit
on
parochial
school
with
this.
let's
suppose
the
only
local
public
high
school
in
the
district
has
classes
in
french
but
not
in
german.
the
parochial
high
school
would
like
to
get
german
textbooks.
the
next
school
district
up
the
line
where
the
public
high
school
does
teach
german
will
have
german
books.
what
would
be
more
natural
or
easier
than
for
the
public
school
book
--
private
school
pupils
to
say
that
we
like
the
german
books
that
are
used
up
to
the
line,
you
haven't
got
any
available
here.
the
obligation
to
furnish
the
books
is
on
the
--
another
reason.
the
obligation
to
furnish
books
is
on
the
district
in
which
the
child
resides
not
on
the
district
where
he
goes
to
school.
that
is
illustrated
in
the
cases
of
my
client's
children.
they
leave
in
east
greenbush.
there
is
no
catholic
high
school
in
east
greenbush.
those
are
my
clients
children
and
there
are
a
couple
of
them
who
are
going
to
catholic
high
schools,
consequently,
have
to
go
to
the
next
district
which
maybe
either
across
the
river
to
albany
or
to
the
town
of
rensselaer
and
they
go
--
they
will
want
high
school
books
corresponding
to
the
ones
that
are
used
in
the
public
schools
in
albany
and
rensselaer,
the
districts
which
they
attend
school
which
is
not
necessarily
the
same
district
in
which
they
reside
and
there's
the
district
in
which
they
reside
that
has
the
obligation
to
furnishing
the
books.
the
approval
of
other
school
authorities
by
the
way,
i
advice
one
reason
why
i've
got
into
that
statute
in
the
term
of
what
it
did
was
that
the
draftsman
of
the
new
york
statute
wanted
to
conform
the
language
to
the
contemporaneously
enacted
federal
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
which
presents
problems
quite
analogous
to
this
and
your
honors
will
find
them
that
rather
the
luminous
pile
of
briefs
before
you,
a
brief
fro
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
dealing
with
this
case
and
its
relation
to
some
extent
with
title
ii
of
the
federal
act
which
also
provides
textbook
of
service
for
children
in
all
schools.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes
sir.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
think
they
could
provide
it
and
certified
as
passing
the
test
of
not
being
a
religious
book
and
not
having
religious
connotations
in
it.
it
couldn't
be
a
so
called
catholic
edition
with
an
“imprimatur”
or
anything
of
that
sort
and
if
the
local
school
board
felt
that
it
was
not
within
the
secular
definition,
it
would
not
only
have
the
right
but
the
duty
to
refuse
to
buy
it.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
get
what
sir?
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
can
only
say
that
i
don't
know.
i
haven't
been
faced
with
that.among
my
responsibilities
is
not
that
of
the
member
of
board
of
education.
i
do
have
other
educational.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
don't
have
it
in
the
record
but
i
can
answer
the
question.
and
before
doing
that,
i
wanted
to
point
out
one
other
very
important
factor.
there
are
of
course
here
three
classes
of
schools
that
are
enrolled
and
we
mustn't
forget
the
three
classes.
they
are
the
public
schools,
there
are
the
private
schools
that
do
not
teach
religion
and
there
are
the
private
schools
that
do
teach
religion
and
the
attack
on
constitutionality
here
is
based
solely
on
the
furnishing
of
books
to
the
third
class
of
students.
there
is
no
objection
in
furnishing
them
free
in
the
public
schools.
there
is
no
objection
to
furnishing
them
free
to
children
in
the
private
schools
so
long
as
the
private
school
doesn't
teach
religion.
i
think
i
have
my
statistics
here.
i
can
answer
that.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
what's
that?
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
your
honors
have
that
case
on
the
docket
for
later
on
in
this
term
i
believe.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i'm
teaching
the
darwinian
theory?
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
think
the
board
of
regents
would
probably
provide
it.
again,
i
don't
speak
for
them.
they
could
order
the
darwinian
or
the
twine
b
theory
i
think
that
parochial
or
private
schools
can
get
buy
that
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
mrs.
coon.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
mrs.--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
no
sir.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
mrs.
coon
represents
the
commissioner
of
education
who
is
the
record
defendant
in
this
case.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
the
commissioner
of
education
is
the
administrative
arm
of
the
board
of
regents.
he
is
appointed
and
removable
by
the
regents.
the
regents
under
new
york
law
are
the
head
of
the
education
department.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
no
because
the
relief
could
be
obtain
fully
against
their
executive
official
by
the
commissioner.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
what's
that?
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
see.
i
was
trying
to
find
my
figures
on
--
there
are
as
i
recalled
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
there
are
about
1400
religious
schools
throughout
the
state
of
various
denominations.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
among
religions?
i
have
to
figure
here
somewhere
and
i
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
call
it
presbyterian
and
i
am
not--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
there
are
several
religious
--
find
that
somewhere
in
this
book.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes
sir.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
in
the
record
of
sir?
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes,
i
would
like
to
elaborate
on
that.
the
figures
that
i
have
is
of
schools,
roman
catholic
1445,
jewish
135
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
jewish
135,
lutheran
57,
episcopalian
48,
seventh-day
adventist
45,
other
religion
and
that
includes
quakers,
mennonites,
eastern
orthodox
and
methodist,
other
religions,
11
and
non-religiously
affiliated
246
of
which
204
have
children
who
are
getting
textbooks
under
this
program
that
is
of
the
non-religiously
affiliated
private
schools.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
204
out
of
246
non-religiously
affiliated
schools
are
having
their
children
get
books.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
1445
your
honor.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
have
gone
at
some
length
into
my
brief
on
the
extent
of
state
control
over
these
schools
and
i
think
that
might
answer
your
honor's
question.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
when
i
get
through
perhaps
because
i
haven't
done
something
further.
all
education,
public
and
private
in
new
york
state
is
under
the
very
broad
powers
of
the
regents.
their
basic
statute
describes
them
as
having
legislative
functions.
they
are
--
they
rule
over
institution
which
is
highly
misnamed
as
the
university
of
the
state
of
new
york.
now
the
university
of
the
state
of
new
york
has
been
in
existence
since
1784,
no
campus,
no
students,
nothing
that
an
ordinary
university
has.
it
is
by
definition
includes
all
the
educational
institutions
public
and
private
within
the
state
and
such
allied
institutions
is
libraries
and
so
forth.
the
schools
have
to
be
charted
by
the
board
of
regents.
there
are
subject
of
hesitation
by
the
regents.
catholic
schools
have
to
be
charted
by
the
regents.
they
are
subject
to
visitation
by
the
regents.
the
curriculum
as
described
in
great
detail.perhaps
the
most
startling
illustration
that
i
can
give
you
your
honor
is
this.
these
students
and
let
us
say
a
catholic
school.
they
draw
down
these
books
from
the
publics
--
of
the
public
school
tithe
and
they
use
them
to
study
courses
prescribed
by
the
regents.
when
they
get
through
--
i'm
referring
to
pupils
in
a
catholic
school.
they
take
an
examination.
who
sets
the
examination?
the
regents.
if
they
pass,
they
get
a
diploma.
whose
diploma
do
they
get?
the
diploma
signed
by
church
authorities?
no.
they
get
a
diploma
in
the
name
of
the
university
of
the
state
of
new
york
bearing
the
seal
of
the
education
department
signed
by
the
commissioner
of
education.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
except
theological
schools.
no,
i
was
talking
about
high
schools.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
was
talking
about
high
school
diplomas.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
a
catholic
high
school
board
if
it
passes
an
examination
set
by
the
regents
and
he
gets
a
regents
diploma
and
the
sample
of
it
is
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
well
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
the
minority
in
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
that
it
might
in
the
long
run
secularize
education
in
the
parochial
schools
by
getting
parochial
school
parents
accustomed
to
using
secular
books
instead
of
the
religiously
oriented
books
they
would
have
been
suppose
to
be
using
otherwise.
that
is
not
a
danger
of
which
we
are
conscious
and
that
it
doesn't
fit
very
well
with
the
theory
of
my
friend.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
my
brother
pollock
talks
about
the
parochial
school
being
practically
a
seminary
of
religion
and
nothing
else.
he
talks
about
permeation
and
all
that
and
that
doesn't
seem
to
fit
very
well
with
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
that
a
danger
as
they
view
it,
of
the
statute
will
be
that
it
will
be
un-permeated.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
either
the
danger
is
highly
speculating.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
what?
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes
and
the
business
which
my
friend
is
also
raised
in
his
brief
about
being
no
way
of
distinguishing
between
the
secular
and
the
religious
in
the
text
would
cast
out
on
the
whole
theory
of
education
even
in
the
public
school.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
no.
they
prescribed
and
brought
outlines
and
in
some
detail
it
has
been
form
with
the
instruction.
the
regulations
know
in
our
brief
and
for
that
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
what
did
you
say
sir?
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
would
not
think
they
were
anti-religious.
i
would
not
think
they
are
pro-religious.
but
the
examination
and
let
us
say
a
boy
in
the
methodist
high
school
would
take
the
regent's
examination.
it
would
be
the
same
examination
that
is
given
to
a
boy
in
a
public
school
and
to
a
boy
in
a
catholic.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
think
they
would
probably
say
that
the
book
must
be
highly
neutral
or
else
not
on
the
list
at
all.
that's
the
problem
they
have
to
confront
with
public
schools.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
you
got
--
well,
may
i
ask
your
honor
this
question
back.
what
kind
of
a
book
would
be
allowed
for
use
in
the
public
school
teaching
the
reformation?
and
the
answer
i
think
is
whatever
kind
of
book
they
find
as
sufficiently
neutral
on
that
subject
to
use
in
the
public
school
would
be
alright
to
use
in
the
private
schools
and
i
think
that's
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
no.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
if
i
haven't
answered
mr.
justice
black's
question.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
the
basic
purpose
of
religious
school
is
to
give
an
adequate
secular
education
plus
religious
instruction
and
the
fact
that
it
was
given
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
get
out
from
what
sir?
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
yes.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
but
they
have
to
meet
the
secular
requirements
laid
down
to
the
state
or
they
can't
exist.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
it
doesn't
immediately
come
to
my
mind
just
what
there
is
but
i
will
look
and
see.
i
could
try.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
will
sir.
but
i
bear
in
mind
that
they
have
to
fill
this
--
the
private
--
the
secular
standards
of
the
state.
i
see
that
the
light
is
on
and
i
shall
not
discuss
our
cases
fully
discussed
in
our
brief.
we
think
this
case
is
completely
alright
under
the
everson
test
which
we
accept
fully
and
i
agree
with
the
chief
justice
in
all
submission
that
there's
no
difference
in
the
facts
between
everson
and
this
and
in
line
with
the
test
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
well,
i
beg
your
pardon.
he
asked
my
friend
whether
there
was
any
difference.
i
beg
your
pardon.
well,
i
submit
there
is
no
basic
difference.
everson
did
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
and
i
don't
think
there's
anything
ideological
about
a
book
called
hallet's
machine
shop
practice
which
is
one
of
the
books
that
is
approved
for
use
in
the
public
schools
of
new
york
and
which
probably
becomes
bad
the
minute
it
is
used
by
a
parochial
school
student.
i'd
like
to
take
just
two
minutes
remaining.
my
friends
have
talked
about
the
establishment
clause.
they
did
not
raise
the
free
exercise
clause
in
their
complaint
below
at
all.
they
have
raised
in
their
brief
here
and
in
closing,
i
simply
want
to
remind
the
court
of
the
fact
that
what
they
are
seeking
to
do
is
to
single
out
that
the
bar
from
the
benefits
of
this
one
--
of
this
broad
general
welfare
statute,
one
particular
class
of
children
and
to
bar
them
on
the
ground,
the
sole
ground
of
the
religious
nature
of
the
school
which
they
attend.
i
suggest
that
the
only
free
exercise
question
involved
in
this
case
is
the
free
exercise
question
which
they
have
raised
by
such
a
type
of
discrimination
and
which
runs
squarely
into
the
language
of
everson
that
the
court
in
regarding
against
the
establishment
clauses
must
see
to
it
that
it
does
not
prevent
a
state
from
extending
the
benefits
of
a
broad
general
welfare
statute
to
all
people
whether
they
be
mohammed,
lutherans,
jews
or
others.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
no
sir.
my
position
is
this
and
i
have
authority
for
this
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
no
sir.
i
think
--
i
must
clear
that
out.
i
take
the
line
that
the
court
took
in
everson,
the
state
can
if
it
wishes
confine
the
benefits
to
public
school
children.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
the
court
said
in
everson
that
that
could
be
done
but
then
i
say
that
if
the
court
goes
outside
there
as
it
did
here
and
extends
the
benefit
to
all
children
then
there's
always
carrying
it
to
all
children
that
cannot
exclude
one
particular
task,
the
religious
ones
and
while
still
going
on
to
give
the
same
books
to
show
the
attending
non-religious
private
schools.
the
new
jersey
statute
would
have
been
plainly
wrong
if
it
said,
buses
are
alright
for
children
going
to
public
schools
and
to
private
schools
as
long
as
they
don't
teach
religion.
the
statute
would
be
all
wrong
if
each
had
buses
maybe
descent,
buses
maybe
used
or
books
maybe
used
to
children
in
public
schools
and
parochial
schools
leaving
out
the
private
ones.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
rely
very
much
so
on
sherbet
v.
verner
and
i
cited
in
that
section
of
our
brief.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
i
wouldn't
--
by
providing
it
only
for
public
schools.
i
wasn't
taken
out
sir
under
the
everson
doctrine
and
i
don't
think
that
sherbet
would
affect
that.
i
think
new
york's
actions
quite
constitutional.
incidentally,
one
more
thing
that
i
forgot
to
mention,
to
correct
the
new
york
law
as
it
was
before
1935,
new
york
did
have
a
law
in
1934
which
provided
free
textbooks
for
everybody
along
with
transportation,
clothing
and
shoes,
provided
that
the
child's
parents
were
indigent
and
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
handed
down
an
opinion
that
that
applied
to
parochial
school
children.
so
if
my
friend
is
correct
and
if
he
wins
here,
he
will
stricken
out
the
provision
of
the
1965
act
but
left
the
1934
one
standing
so
that
according
to
that
construction,
a
child
who
goes
to
a
public
school
gets
free
books
whether
he
is
rich
or
poor.
a
child
who
goes
to
a
private
school
that
doesn't
teach
religion
gets
free
books
whether
he
is
rich
or
poor.
a
child
that
goes
to
a
religious
school
will
go
on
getting
free
books
provided
that
he
can
prove
that
his
family
is
on
relief.
in
that
i
submit
rather
serious
questions
of
equal
protection
and
free
exercise.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
your
honor,
i
don't
think
i
can
generalize
on
hypothetical
statute
that
against
the
background
of
necessities
or
judgments
that
i
cannot
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
it's
been
--
argument
about
mathematics.
they
may
well
be
a
distinction
but
my
only
answer
to
that
would
be
that
when
you're
faced
to
the
facts
in
that
situation,
the
thing
is
to
see
whether
it
squares
with
the
dual
test
that
this
court
laid
down
in
schemp.
a
primary
secular
purpose
that
in
effect
which
neither
advances
nor
inhibits
religion,
if
it
meets
that
test
as
we
think
this
program
does
then
it
would
be
alright.
i
would
find
it
difficult
--
i
would
find
it
difficult
to
express
an
opinion
your
honor
without
knowing
all
the
facts.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
if
they
say
all
the
church
schools
in
new
york,
i
would
think
that
that
would
raise
a
very
serious
question
it
would
have
to
be
a
program
as
this
one
is
for
all
children
in
all
schools
whether
they're
church
schools
or
public
schools
or
other.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
what
did
you
say
sir?
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
no
sir.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
all
schools
which
make
the
compulsory
education
law
--
if
that
includes
church
schools
--
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
sir,
the
statute
provides
free
book
to
all
children
and
all
schools
submit
the
compulsory
education
law.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
there
are
three
classes
of
such
schools.
there
are
the
public
schools,
there
are
the
private
schools
that
don't
teach
religion
and
it's
still
complying
with
the
compulsory
education
law,
and
there
are
the
private
schools
that
do
teach
religion.
mr.
porter
r.
chandler
that
is
the
only
attack
that
is
being
made
here.
the
statute
--
my
friend
is
attacking
only
the
distribution
of
books
to
children
in
church
schools.
he
is
not
attacking
the
delivery
of
such
books
to
children
in
other
private
schools.
that
i
say
raises
a
very
serious
question
under
equal
protection
and
the
free
exercise
religion.
i
hope
i
made
myself
clear.
thank
you
sir.
