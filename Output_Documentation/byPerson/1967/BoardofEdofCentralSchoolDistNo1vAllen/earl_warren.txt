chief
justice
earl
warren
in
schools
what,
i
didn't
understand?
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
to
your
main
argument,
are
you
going
to
discuss
the
question
of
standing
to
sue
in
this
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
need
the
standing
to
sue
issue
would
be
the
same
in
this
court
as
it
was
in
new
york?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
in
the
same
posture
as
it
was
in
new
york?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
in
new
york
that
they
took
the
school
board
out
of
its
dilemma
by
saying
that
the
act
was
constitutional
and
they
were
no
longer
subject
then
to
any
sanctions
for
not
obeying
the
law
of
new
york,
which
was
the
reason
that
they
granted
the
standing
to
sue,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
you
come
to
this
court,
do
you
not?
and
asked
us
to
take
jurisdiction
because
your
board
of
education
is
faced
with
a
dilemma
that
it
cannot
out
of,
namely
that
if
it
obeys
the
law
of
new
york
--
i
mean
if
it
refuses
to
obey
the
law
of
new
york
that
it's
subject
to
sanctions.
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
has
now
availed
that
the
law
is
constitutional
and
they
can
go
forward
without
any
danger
of
sanctions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
might
for
some
people.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
is
it
for
this
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
mr.
justice.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
for
the
purposes
of
your
argument,
what
interpretation
of
the
statute
do
you
want
us
to
assume
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
not
by
the
religious
authorities.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
do
you
think
we're
entitled
to
take
that
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
position
do
you
want
us
to
think
we
ought
to
take?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
argued
this
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
assumed
in
your
argument
below
and
in
this
court
that
these
books
were
to
be
prescribed
by
a
public
authority?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
prescribed
by
whom?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
conclusions
does
that
lead
you
to
then
on
this
thing
that
we've
been
discussing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
your
position
is
that
if
the
school
board
in
buffalo,
new
york
prescribed
certain
books
that
the
children
in
new
york
would
demand
those
books
and
you
got
them
and
used
them
in
a
manner
that
the
statute
contemplates.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
your
concern
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
argued
below?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
argued
here
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
state
board
of
education
in
new
york
have
anything
to
do
with
the
textbooks
in
the
various
districts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
to
what
books
are
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they're
the
ultimate
authority.
thanks.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
are
you
asking
us
to
take
the
opinion
of
everson
or
the
dissenting
opinion
mr.
justice
rutledge
that
you've
just
been
talking
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
stand
on
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
the
everson
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
if
you
would
mind
telling
us
just
what
difference
on
the
facts
there
is
between
the
everson
case
and
this
one.
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
getting
the
children
there
an
integral
part
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
would
you
say
of
the
health
programs
that
they?
or
take
--
let's
take
the
school
lunch
program
that
they
have
in
the
schools.
what
would
you
say
about
that
as
to
whether
that
is
in
accord
with
everson
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
supplying
non-religious
books,
is
there
any
proselytizing
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
that
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
to
what
extent
and
what
effect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
about
the
health
facilities
for
schools?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
about
if
they
did
--
how
about
if
they
gave
hearing
aids
to
the
youngsters
so
they
could
--
so
they
could
better
hear
in
school?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
that
be
contributing
to
it
because
of
the
idea
of
religion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
you'd
make
a
difference
between
a
posture
chair
for
the
children
on
the
one
hand
and
the
hearing
aid
on
the
other
because
one
chair
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
hearing
anything
or
seeing
anything
or
religion
--
religious,
but
the
other
would.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
use
them
in
schools.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
would
use
them
in
the
school
class,
of
course.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
without
pupils
getting
to
the
school.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
you
--
we
have
read
that
it
furthers
only
religion,
is
that
what
you
said?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
make
any
distinction
between
the
elementary
schools
and
the
higher
education?
chief
justice
earl
warren
collegiate
education.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
can
you
distinguish
the
exemption,
tax
exemptions
from
the
thing
of
this
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
if
you
are
to
prevail,
you
believe
that
we
would
also
be
required
to
take
away
the
exemption
of
all
church
taxation,
all
church
school
taxation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'm
speaking
about
your
principle.
i
ask
you
what
you
believed
and
you
said,
you
believe
that
if
you
were
right
here
that
they
had
--
or
not
entitle
to
any
taxation
or
any
exemption
of
taxation,
now,
that
being
true
wouldn't
the
principle
apply
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
narrowly
could
we
draw
so
as
to
take
your
position
on
textbooks
and
not
interfere
with
anything
else?
will
you
give
us
the
formula
that
we
could
use?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mrs.
coon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
i
did
see
your
motion
of
james
e.
allen,
jr.
to
dismiss
one
of
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
one
that
involved
the
merits?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
just
wondering.
in
the
statement
of
the
case
here
in
the
jurisdiction
--
statement
as
to
jurisdiction,
it's
contended
that
these
people
were
in
a
dilemma
and
that
they
were
obliged
either
to
obey
the
new
york
law
or
be
subject
to
sanctions
and
that's
what
got
them
into
and
still
they
have
the
duty
to
take
care
of
the
children
now.
your
court
of
appeals
held
that
they
were
no
longer
in
a
dilemma.
they
held
that
the
act
was
constitutional
and
how
was
that
give
them
standing
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
fact
is
that
they
state
in
their
statement
of
jurisdiction
that
they
are
in
a
legal
dilemma
that
they
cannot
act
without
subjecting
themselves
to
some
kind
of
sanctions
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
they
are
--
they
can
be
subject
to
no
sanction
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
law
in
which
they
are
obliged
to
act
under
the
court
of
appeals
order
is
constitutional.
so
doesn't
that
quite
bother
the
premise
upon
which
they
come
to
this
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
certainly,
they
don't
expect
us
to
say
that
the
new
york
statute
is
unconstitutional
according
to
new
york
constitution
do
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
asked
mr.
pollock
if
this
act
should
be
able
to
interpret
to
say
that
the
school
board
in
buffalo,
new
york
could
furnish
school
children
in
the
city
of
new
york.
the
books
that
they
chose
rather
than
the
books
that
were
chosen
by
the
--
and
approved
by
the
school
board
of
new
york
and
they
said,
yes.
do
you
subscribe
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
would
have
to
give
--
who
would
have
to
loan
them
the
books?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
have
to
buy
them
or
get
them
from
buffalo.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
i
should
know
by
now
but
i
like
to
ask
you
this
question
again.
under
this
act,
would
a
religious
school
have
the
right
to
prescribe
its
own
textbooks
as
long
as
they
were
not
religious
in
character
according
to
their
appraisal
and
submit
them
to
the
--
those
textbooks
to
the
board
and
then
could
the
board
spend
public
moneys
to
loan
those
books
to
the
parochial
school
children.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it
is
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
but
they
could
approve
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
entire
textbook
system
of
the
broken
schools
in
that
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
chandler.
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
what
extent
can
they
add
books
in
that
list
for
parochial
schools?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
that
the
religious
school
said,
you
don't
teach
german
in
the
schools
in
this
district,
we
want
to
teach
german.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we
don't
want
any
of
the
books
that
any
of
the
public
schools
use
for
german.
we
want
our
own.
we
want
our
own
german
book.
could
they
then
go
to
the
school
board
and
get
that
book
approved
and
distribute
it
to
them?

you

chief
justice
earl
warren
how
can
you
distinguish
the
exemption,
tax
exemptions
from
the
thing
of
this
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
if
you
are
to
prevail,
you
believe
that
we
would
also
be
required
to
take
away
the
exemption
of
all
church
taxation,
all
church
school
taxation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'm
speaking
about
your
principle.
i
ask
you
what
you
believed
and
you
said,
you
believe
that
if
you
were
right
here
that
they
had
--
or
not
entitle
to
any
taxation
or
any
exemption
of
taxation,
now,
that
being
true
wouldn't
the
principle
apply
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
narrowly
could
we
draw
so
as
to
take
your
position
on
textbooks
and
not
interfere
with
anything
else?
will
you
give
us
the
formula
that
we
could
use?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mrs.
coon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
i
did
see
your
motion
of
james
e.
allen,
jr.
to
dismiss
one
of
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
one
that
involved
the
merits?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
just
wondering.
in
the
statement
of
the
case
here
in
the
jurisdiction
--
statement
as
to
jurisdiction,
it's
contended
that
these
people
were
in
a
dilemma
and
that
they
were
obliged
either
to
obey
the
new
york
law
or
be
subject
to
sanctions
and
that's
what
got
them
into
and
still
they
have
the
duty
to
take
care
of
the
children
now.
your
court
of
appeals
held
that
they
were
no
longer
in
a
dilemma.
they
held
that
the
act
was
constitutional
and
how
was
that
give
them
standing
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
fact
is
that
they
state
in
their
statement
of
jurisdiction
that
they
are
in
a
legal
dilemma
that
they
cannot
act
without
subjecting
themselves
to
some
kind
of
sanctions
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
they
are
--
they
can
be
subject
to
no
sanction
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
law
in
which
they
are
obliged
to
act
under
the
court
of
appeals
order
is
constitutional.
so
doesn't
that
quite
bother
the
premise
upon
which
they
come
to
this
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
certainly,
they
don't
expect
us
to
say
that
the
new
york
statute
is
unconstitutional
according
to
new
york
constitution
do
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
asked
mr.
pollock
if
this
act
should
be
able
to
interpret
to
say
that
the
school
board
in
buffalo,
new
york
could
furnish
school
children
in
the
city
of
new
york.
the
books
that
they
chose
rather
than
the
books
that
were
chosen
by
the
--
and
approved
by
the
school
board
of
new
york
and
they
said,
yes.
do
you
subscribe
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
would
have
to
give
--
who
would
have
to
loan
them
the
books?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
have
to
buy
them
or
get
them
from
buffalo.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
i
should
know
by
now
but
i
like
to
ask
you
this
question
again.
under
this
act,
would
a
religious
school
have
the
right
to
prescribe
its
own
textbooks
as
long
as
they
were
not
religious
in
character
according
to
their
appraisal
and
submit
them
to
the
--
those
textbooks
to
the
board
and
then
could
the
board
spend
public
moneys
to
loan
those
books
to
the
parochial
school
children.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it
is
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
but
they
could
approve
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
entire
textbook
system
of
the
broken
schools
in
that
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
chandler.
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
what
extent
can
they
add
books
in
that
list
for
parochial
schools?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
that
the
religious
school
said,
you
don't
teach
german
in
the
schools
in
this
district,
we
want
to
teach
german.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we
don't
want
any
of
the
books
that
any
of
the
public
schools
use
for
german.
we
want
our
own.
we
want
our
own
german
book.
could
they
then
go
to
the
school
board
and
get
that
book
approved
and
distribute
it
to
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
pollock.
