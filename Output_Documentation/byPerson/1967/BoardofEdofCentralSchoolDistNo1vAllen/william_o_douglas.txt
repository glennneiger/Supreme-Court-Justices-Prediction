justice
william
o.
douglas
i
suppose
that
you're
answer
to
justice
stewart's
question
would
be
that
if
that
happened,
if
this
was
a
school
board,
a
public
school
board
funneling
religious
tracks
with
public
money
to
protect
your
school,
that
could
be
on
the
constitution.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
might
suggest
we
might
do
a
better
job
with
that
than
we've
been
doing
in
the
senate.

justice
william
o.
douglas
i
suppose
the
darwinian
theory
would
shock
some
religious
groups
isn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don't
ask
you
to
decide
it
but
i'm
saying,
what
is
the
policy
of
the
board
of
regents
on
that
kind
of
issue?
justice
william
o.
douglas
or
some
competing
theory.
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
there
anybody
here
speaking
for
the
board
of
regents
by
the
way?
justice
william

douglas
you
do.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
thought
you
were
trying
to
distinguish
yourself
from
the
board.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood.
justice
william

douglas
i
understand.
justice

they're
not
a

206?
206
you
say?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
theories
expressed
by
the
centers
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
this
old
system
perhaps
in
the
long
run
to
secularize
the
education
in
the
parochial
schools.
justice
william

douglas
did
i
misread
that
opinion?
justice
william

douglas
well,
he
was
talking
about
the
future
and
not
the
--
justice
william

douglas
well,
there
is
that
danger
and
maybe
the
danger
that
mr.
pollock
spoke
of
would
be
more
realized.
justice
william

douglas
how
does
the
board
of
regent

thus
the

of
regents
differentiate
the
curriculum
it
prescribes
for
say
a
methodist
parochial
school

school?

when

the

of
regents
make?

then
it
would
be
anti-religious.

by
definition
is
not
