justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it's
satisfactory
how
that
the
books
to
be
improved
happen
to
be
secular
books?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
record
does
--
does
this
record
show
how
secular
books
are
actually
used
in
a
parochial
school
to
further
the
school's
religious
aims?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
evidence
of
the
record
in
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
an
algebra
book?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
a
geometry
book,
is
that
--
is
that
book
when
it's
being
used
by
a
teacher
in
a
parochial
school
so
intimately
related
to
teaching
religion?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
sustain
this.
i
mean,
this
is
hard
--
this
is
your
toughest
case
isn't
it?
geometry
book
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me
about
that
book
as
to
how
it
furthers
the
religious
aim
of
the
school.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
accept
that
for
the
moment.
now,
tell
me
--
justice
byron
r.
white
nor
anything
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
statute
then
i
would
suppose
is
that
you
would
suggest
it's
just
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
now,
are
we
getting
to
any
questions
of
whether
the
books
are
secular
or
not
or
who
approves
them
or
anything
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
state's
detestation
that
the
goal
is
lost
to
--
to
further
a
secular
goal
of
education.
it's
just
false.
it
should
not
be
accepted
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
including
geometry?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
have
any
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
we
supposed
to
do,
take
the
judicial
notice
of
that
or?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
your
position
--
and
we
would
have
to
first
--
the
predicate
for
your
argument
is
that
this
is
--
that
these
are
religious
schools.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
if
--
i
suppose
some
schools
could
be
less
related
to
a
sect
vis-à-vis.
justice
byron
r.
white
chartered
as
a
religious
school?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
why
would
you
say
that
if
a
religious
school
was
furnishing
free
lunches
and
the
state
suddenly
came
along
and
furnished
the
free
lunches
for
the
children
in
this
religious
school,
why
wouldn't
that
be
bad?
because
they're
certainly
aide
to
the
school
and
the
school
is
totally
a
religious
institution.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean,
if
not
connected
with
the
functions
which
aide
religion.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
the
algebra
class
is
a
functionating
religion
although
the
lunch
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
was
authority
in
the
state
law
to
provide
school
books
in
public
schools
for
alston?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
your
argument
would
also
--
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
an
educational
allowance
or
a
book
allowance
in
cash
to
all
students
in
the
state
would
be
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
take
that
educational
allowance
by
having
some
question
of
the
child
was
free
to
buy
a
religious
book
with
a
big
amount.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
suggest
the
g.i.
bill
then
may
have
some
question
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
if
it
weren't
i
suppose
that
even
if
the
statute
were
sustained
that
specific
practice
could
be
attack
in
the
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
clear
in
this
record
that
parochial
schools
involved
here
were
not
previously
furnishing
the
textbook?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
law
covers
--
the
law
would
permit
this
furnishing
of
textbooks
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
toward
those
parochial
schools
which
were
themselves
buy
the
textbooks
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
did?
you
wouldn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
that
it
was
wholly
valid.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
entire
area
of
new
york
covered
by
at
least
one
school
district?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
school
district
covering
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
what
percent
of
the
books
on
that
list
are
actually
used
in
the
public
schools?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
small
percent
of
schools.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
doesn't
include
the
least
that
they
approve
for
parochial
schools
with
the
public
school
list.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
these
are
books
that
are
approved
for
use
in
public
schools,
but
maybe
not
that
any
of
them
were
used.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
they
could
get
approve
toward
this
history
approved.
justice
byron
r.
white
get
twine
b's
history
approved
as
a
textbook
in
a
parochial
school.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
sir,
i
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
true
of

justice
byron

white
yes.
justice
byron

were
you
also
–
justice
byron

either
danger
is

justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
to
suspend.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
first
amendment,
either
danger
might
have
validated
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
really
arguing
then
that
before
this
law
was
passed
in
new
york
providing
any
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
your
argument
be
the
same
if
new
york
is
going
to
give
free
school
books
to
public
children
--
public
school
children
have
to
give
it
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
can
they
enter
the
free
exercise?
justice
byron

white
yes
but
