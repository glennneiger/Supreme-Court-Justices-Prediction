justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
may
we
take
that
as
an
interpretation
for
the
new
york
statute
regulations?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
the
court
said,
what
the
majority
said.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
they
said,
as
i
gather
and
you
believe
they
did,
whether
they
assumed
to
however
they
did
it
in
effect
that
they
must
be
textbooks
designated
by
the
public
authority,
why
isn't
that
an
interpretation
upon
which
we
should
proceed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
we
can't
construe
the
new
york
statute
and
regulations
if
the
court
of
appeals
has
given
that
definitive
construction,
can
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
will
public
schools
are
in
addition
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
only
public
schools?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
would
include
school
lunches?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
that
theory,
would
the
action
of
the
zoning
board
in
zoning
an
area
to
permit
building
of
a
practical
school
be
an
aid
to
establish
into
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
suppose
we
have
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
we
have
to
consider
doubling
the
--
were
you
principle
if
we
agreed
with
you
to
carry
us.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
reconcile
the
agreements?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
reconcile
the
proposition
with
the
state
of
the
agreements
of
standing
as
foreclosing
this
court
by
reason
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
it
wasn't
the
(inaudible)
that
questions
standing
the
sue
in
new
jersey
which
new
jersey
sustained
what
this
court
said.
that's
a
problem
here
that
federal
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
suppose
--
i
don't
suppose
what
the
parties
considered
if
the
standing
question
is
considered
--
that
the
parties
don't
want
us
to
consider
which
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
happened
in
--
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
don't
suggest
that
the
books
that
are
maybe
designated
are
books
that
are
actually
used
in
the
public
school.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
maybe
any
kind
of
a
book
as
long
as
the
public
authority
will
approve
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
except
that
they
must
be
secular?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that's
what
the
court
says?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
what
the
attorney
general
said?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
before
the
law
of
either
was
for
free
textbooks,
the
rule
has
any
exception?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
mean
i
understood
you
say

at
all

in
most,
were
they?

william

new
york
city
they
were.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
mean
they
could
approve
only
books
which
came
within
the
statutory
definition?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
statutory
definition
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
rely
it
all
in
sherbet
and
verner
for
your

justice
william

well
then,
may
we
take
