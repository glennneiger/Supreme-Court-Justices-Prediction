mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
where
a
consonant
with
the
religious
clauses
of
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
state
of
new
york
may
furnish
textbooks
purchased
with
tax
raised
funds
for
use
in
religious
schools.
the
material
facts
in
the
case
are
not
in
dispute.
prior
to
1965,
section
701
of
the
new
york
education
law,
authorized
local
school
boards
to
purchase
textbooks
and
either
to
loan
or
sell
them
to
pupils
in
the
public
schools
in
the
state.
in
1965,
the
provisions
relating
to
textbooks
in
section
701
were
amended
effective
september
1,
1966.
the
effect
of
the
amendment
was
to
turn
a
permissive
practice
into
a
mandatory
one
and
to
extend
the
coverage
of
the
law
to
private
schools.
under
the
law
as
amended,
each
school
board
in
new
york
must
purchase
and
long
free
of
charge
to
all
children
residing
in
its
district
enrolled
in
a
grade
from
7
through
12
of
an
accredited
public
or
private
school
any
textbook
requested
by
the
child
so
long
as
the
textbook
was
one
designated
for
use
in
any
public
school
in
the
state
or
by
any
school
board
in
the
state.
as
originally
enacted,
the
law
contained
no
limit
on
the
number
of
books
required
to
be
purchased
and
no
limit
on
the
amount
of
money
that
had
to
be
spent
for
the
books
by
the
local
school
district.
it
did
however
provide
for
state
reimbursement
or
state
allocation
to
the
extent
of
$10.00
a
pupil.
in
the
view
of
the
east
greenbush
school
board
which
had
children
residing
in
its
district
who
were
enrolled
in
grade
7
through
12
accredited
private
religious
schools.
the
provisions
of
section
701
as
amended
violated
both
the
new
york
state
constitution
and
the
first
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
both
of
which
each
member
had
sworn
to
uphold.
failure
to
implement
the
law
on
a
part
of
this
board
would
have
subjected
the
members
a
removal
from
office
and
also
would
have
subjected
the
school
district
to
a
loss
of
state
funds.
to
resolve
this
conflict,
the
greenbush
school
board
filed
an
action
in
the
supreme
court
albany
county.
the
relief
sought
in
the
complaint
was
a
judgment
declaring
the
textbook
law
to
the
extent
that
related
to
church
schools
unconstitutional
and
in
violation
to
both
the
new
york
state
constitution
on
the
first
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution.
it
also
sought
an
order
in
joining
the
state
commissioner
of
education
from
implementing
the
provisions
of
the
law.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
these
boards
have
raised
no
constitutional
objection.
after
the
suit
was
filed
and
the
suit
incidentally
was
filed
april
29,
1966
which
is
about
four
month
before
the
law
was
to
go
into
effect,
after
the
suit
was
filed,
the
textbook
law
was
further
amended
in
two
respects.
the
first
respect
was
to
reduce
the
financial
book
on
the
local
school
boards.
the
second
respect
was
to
define
a
textbook
as
used
in
the
statute
to
mean
a
book
which
a
student
is
required
to
use
as
a
text
for
a
semester
or
more
in
a
school
he
legally
attends.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
in
a
school
he
legally
attends.
the
state
answered
the
complaint,
did
not
raise
any
material
issue
of
fact
but
did
deny
the
allegations
relating
to
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
law.
the
state
also
raised
a
number
of
affirmative
offenses,
principal
one
of
which
was
that
the
greenbush
school
board
lacks
standing
to
sue
on
the
ground
that
it
was
an
instrumentality
of
the
state
and
could
not
challenge
state
law.
after
issue
was
joined,
five
parents
of
children
who
resided
in
the
east
greenbush
school
board
were
permitted
to
intervene
in
the
action.
in
their
answer,
they
too
did
not
raise
any
material
issue
of
fact
but
did
deny
the
allegations
of
unconstitutionality
of
the
law.
and
in
addition,
they
raised
a
number
of
affirmative
defenses.
the
thrust
of
these
defenses
was
that
to
deny
the
books
to
them
and
their
children
while
permitting
the
furnishing
of
these
books
to
pupils
attending
private
nonsectarian
schools
constituted
an
interference
with
the
free
exercise
of
their
religion
and
a
denial
of
due
process
and
equal
protection.
all
parties
then
move
for
judgment.
in
substance,
judgment
on
the
pleading,
they
were
in
all
affidavits.
at
the
time
of
oral
argument,
the
board
of
education
of
union
free
school
district
no.
3
was
joined
as
a
party
plaintiff
and
was
deemed
to
have
adopted
all
the
pleadings
in
the
case.
the
supreme
court
albany
county
granted
the
plaintiff's
cross-motion
for
judgment.
it
ruled
that
the
greenbush
--
the
two
school
boards
had
standing
to
sue,
and
also
that
the
law
as
amended
in
1965
and
in
1966
violated
the
state
constitution
and
both
the
establishment
of
free
exercise
clauses
of
the
federal
constitution
and
a
judgment
was
entered
to
that
effect
which
among
other
things
enjoined
the
state
from
implementing
the
statute.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
appellant
division,
third
department.
three
of
the
justices
constituting
a
majority
of
that
court
voted
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
albany
county
and
dismiss
the
complaint
on
the
sole
ground
that
the
appellants
lack
standing
to
sue.
two
remaining
justices
would
have
found
that
the
appellants
had
standing
and
would
have
voted
to
reverse
on
the
merits.
they
would
have
found
a
law
constitutional
in
all
respects.
the
case
was
then
appealed
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
that
court
reached
the
merits
of
the
action.
it
ruled
that
the
appellants
had
standing
to
sue.
and
by
a
four-to-three
vote,
it
ruled
that
the
textbook
law
as
amended
did
not
violate
state
constitution,
did
not
violate
the
establishment
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.
approximately
20
years
ago,
this
court
for
the
first
time
defined
the
scope
of
the
establishment
clause's
coverage.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
as
far
as
i
know,
i
would
rest
on
the
record.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
said
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
since
the
standing
has
been
decided
and
no
issue
has
been
raised
by
the
appellees.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
no,
it
need
not,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
i
think
this
case
comes
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
well,
i
didn't
understand
it
that
way,
your
honor.
i
--
as
i
understood
it,
they
ruled
that
a
state
board
is
not
–
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
as
i
understand,
the
ruling
of
the
court
on
the
standing
question,
they
said
that
the
state
board
has
standing
to
sue
and
to
challenge
to
the
state
law.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
well,
as
far
as
i
can
say
here,
i
think
if
they
went
ahead
and
violated
the
federal
constitution,
it
is
quite
conceivable
that
they
might
be
subject
to
other
liabilities
which
have
not
so
far
been
asserted.
i
would
think
that
they
might
have
taxpayer
cases
exposure
if
they're
spending
federal
funds
in
violation
of
the
federal
constitution
or
spending
state
funds
in
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
so
i
don't
think
the
case
would
be
at
an
end
on
that
question.
i
think
that
they're
not
out
of
the
dilemma
yet
and
i
would
think
that
if
--
until
the
federal
question
was
decided,
this
would
be
an
open
question.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
would
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
there
are
people
in
these
school
districts
who
might
well
attack
the
active
spending
funds
in
violation
of
the
--
of
what
they
deem
to
be
in
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
and
that
might
raise
the
involved
issue
again
so
that
they
would
then
be
in
jeopardy.
they
would
have
the
same
dilemma
that
is
to
risk
the
violation
and
to
spend
the
funds
or
not
to
risk
the
violation.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
--
i'm
not
saying
that
it's
clear
on
the
law.
i
think
justice
van
voorhis
pointed
this
out
in
his
dissent
on
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
the
regulations
are
attached
as
an
appendix
to
the
appellant's
brief
beginning
at
page
4a.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
in
part
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
in
part,
it
is.
the
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
don't
think
that
they
raised
the
question.
they
assumed
that
the
books
would
be
secular.
i
think
that
they're
saying
that
the
statute
--
construing
the
statute
to
require
the
giving
of
secular
books
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
--
as
designated
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
understand,
your
honor.
i
think
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
as
i
understand
it,
did
not
get
into
that
question.
they
just
said
that
the
books
would
be
prescribed
by
public
authorities
without
--
i
don't
think
that
they
found
any
problem
with
the
language
of
the
statutes
in
majority
of
places.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
that
would
raise
a
definite
problem,
your
honor.
and
as
i
said,
justice
van
voorhis
was
bothered
with
that
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
majority
i
think
this
one
had
on
the
basis
that
the
statute
meant
to
them
that
it
was
the
public
authorities
who
designated
the
book.
they
did
not
do
anything
more
than
quote
the
language
of
the
statute
as
i
read
the
opinion
and
said
that
this
is
what
it
is,
that
the
public
authorities
are
the
ones
that
designate
the
books.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
what
--
i
don't
know
why.
i
think
that
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
for
federal
questions
involved
in
this
case,
i
don't
know
why
we
should
bound
here
by
the
construction
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
did
and
i've
read
that
opinion
and
i
don't
know
that
it
did.
i
think
it
cited
the
statute
and
then
said
that
they
went
into
the
secularity
of
the
books
but
didn't
do
anything
more
than
that.
as
i
understand
it
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
that's
what
it
said.
that's
what
it
said
the
statue
has.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
again,
if
i
may
read
from
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
they
say
that
only
textbooks
designated
for
use
by
the
public
schools
are
approved
by
boards
of
education,
trustees
or
school
authorities
may
be
lent
and
inside
the
statute.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct.
they
do
not
go
on
to
say
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
they
do
not
define
that
in
this
opinion.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct.
i
don't
think
the
court
did
define
that
in
the
opinion.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
well,
i
would
say
that
we
could
assume
here
that
the
books
are
designated
by
the
public
authorities
and
not
the
parochial
schools
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
religious
authorities
of
the
parochial
schools.
we
could
assume
that
and
still
find
the
statute
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
don't
think
so
but
i
think
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
you
ought
to
take
the
position
that
the
statute
is
vague
and
is
susceptible
of
the
construction
of
the
parochial
schools
may
actually
designate
the
books.
i
think
in
implementation,
this
is
probably
how
in
part
it
could
work
out
anyhow.
but
i
think
that
even
if
the
statute
is
not
construed
that
way,
i
think
that
the
law
is
still
bad
so
that
i
would
be
satisfied
if
this
court
were
to
construe
the
statute
to
mean
that
the
public
authorities
designate
the
books.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
have
not.
i
have
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
have
maybe
--
i
have
assumed
that's
the
case,
but
i
have
also
argued
that
religious
schools
may
play
a
role
in
the
selection
–
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
may
play
--
the
religious
schools
may
play
a
role
in
the
selection
of
books.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
in
the
selection
of
books.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
well,
prescribed
by
the
public
authorities,
but
i
have
argued
that
the
public
authorities
in
many
cases
consist
of
a
board
of
education
elected
by
the
residence
of
the
particular
school
district
and
in
some
cases,
i
think
where
--
particularly
where
some
religious
group
has
let's
say
an
ethnic
majority,
they
do
have
power
to
elect
the
people
to
the
board
who
are
more
prone
to
follow
their
views.
and
once
this
board
is
elected
and
does
have
the
power
to
designate
books,
it
would
not
be
unusual
to
have
these
books.
these
boards
designate
books
which
are
not
contrary
to
the
face
which
they
hold.
i
think
to
that
extent,
you
have
some
involvement
or
some
possibility
of
involvement.
so
whether
the
books
are
designated
by
a
public
authority,
the
public
authority
itself
is
made
up
of
people.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
i
quarrel
with
the
statement
that
it
makes
it
plain.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
trustees
of
a
board
of
education
or
corresponding
officers,
whether
one
or
more
and
by
whatever
name
known
of
a
city
school
district
or
other
school
districts
however
created.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
yes,
there
is.
the
term
school
authorities
means
that
trustees
or
board
of
education
or
corresponding
officers,
whether
one
or
more
and
by
whatever
name
known
of
a
city
school
district
or
other
school
districts
however
created.
now
that
that
might
--
that
would
define,
presumably
define
school
authorities.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
yes,
it
would.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct.
that
would
define
the
term
“school
authorities”.
but
not
define
the
term
boards
of
education
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
take
it
that
there
is
a
question
in
my
mind,
and
i
don't
know
that
anybody
can
solve
it
by
even
going
to
the
construction
laws
to
whether
or
not
the
books
must
be
designated
by
a
public
authority.
i
think
there's
some
question
in
the
statute
and
i
think
even
if
there
is
no
question,
that
there
is
--
the
books
must
be
designated
for
use
by
a
public
authority,
i
think
you
still
have
the
problem
that
the
public
authority
could
consist
of
eight
board
of
education
anywhere
in
the
state
who
has
the
right
to
designate
books.
and
i
think
i
have
suggested
in
my
brief
that
this
does
make
the
act
susceptible
to
parochial
interference.
if
a
school
board
is
dominated
by
a
faith,
it
can
designate
books
for
use.
then,
school
boards
anywhere
else
in
the
state
or
children
anywhere
else
in
the
state
can
order
that
book.
and
once
the
book
is
on
the
list
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that
is
my
construction
of
the
statute.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
yes.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
yes,
it
is.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
yes,
it
is.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
it
could
happen.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
but
i
think
in
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
it
could
well
happen.
i
think
what's
happened
in
a
good
many
of
the
school
districts
in
new
york,
textbooks
are
not
supplied
by
the
schools.
and
i
think
where
you
have
tax
funds
raised
to
be
spent
for
books
you
might
have
more
action
in
this
area
if
you
do
at
present.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct.
the
same
problem
would
exist
and
that
would
be
the
one
step.
i
have
posed
the
two
step
situation,
but
that
would
be
an
infirmity
in
spending
in
that
instance,
too.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
no,
i
think
that
would
--
we
would
have
to
--
we
would
have
to
find
out
what
the
--
where
the
public
funds
are
being
used.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
they
have
a
right
of
oversee
generally.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
they
have
a
right
of
supervision
of
all
the
local
board
and
boards
of
education.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
take
it
that
they
would
decide
questions
of
as
to
whether
a
particular
book
ought
to
be
used
or
should
not
be
used.
they
would
be
the
ultimate
authority
on
it
i
see
on
that
connection.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
it
is.
i
think
the
counsel
is
charged
with
the
implementation
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
yes,
there
is.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
these
have
the
--
these
have
binding
force
on
the
school
boards
throughout
the
state,
the
opinion
of
counsel,
i
understand.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
it
was
issued
after
the
case
was
argued
about
it.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
in
the
everson
case,
which
was
decided
by
this
court
20
years
ago,
the
court
defined
the
scope
of
the
establishment
clause
as
coverage.
the
definition
consisted
of
seven
sentences
that
appears
at
330
us
15
and
is
quoted
at
page
10
of
appellant's
brief.
one
of
the
sentences
reads
that
no
tax
in
any
amount,
large
or
small,
can
be
levied
to
support
any
religious
activities
or
institutions
whatever
they
may
be
called
or
whatever
form
they
may
adopt
to
teach
or
practice
religion.
while
four
justices
in
that
case
disagreed
with
the
application
of
that
definition
to
the
facts
of
everson,
all
of
the
justices
agreed
with
the
definition,
and
the
definition
has
been
repeated
and
reaffirmed
at
least
three
times,
once
unanimously
until
a
castle
against
watkins
in
1961.
in
applying
the
everson
definition
to
the
facts
of
the
case,
the
majority
started
out
by
saying
that
state
legislation
should
not
be
overturned
if
it
was
within
the
state's
constitutional
power
even
though
it
approached
the
verge
of
that
power.
said
on
the
one
hand
new
jersey
could
not,
consistent
with
the
establishment
clause,
contribute
tax
funds
for
the
support
of
any
religious
institution
which
teaches
the
tenants
in
faiths
of
any
church.
presumably
here,
it
had
in
mind
church
schools.
on
the
other
hand,
new
jersey
could
not
interfere
with
the
free
exercise
of
religion
by
their
citizens
such
as
by
excluding
believers
or
non-believers
because
of
their
faith
or
lack
of
it
from
the
benefits
of
any
welfare
legislation.
but
the
issue
does
pose
it
remained
only
for
the
majority
there
to
determine
the
nature
of
the
benefit,
which
was
bus
transportation,
of
where
and
how
it
was
used.
and
it
determined
that
bus
transportation
was
like
certain
other
government
services
such
as
police
and
fire
protection,
sewage
disposal,
streets
and
highways.
the
reason
that
it
was
no
different
than
these
other
services
the
court
suggested
was
that
it
was
separate
and
indisputably
marked
off
from
the
primary
function
of
the
school,
which
was
the
teaching
of
religion.
in
other
words,
funds,
tax
funds
were
not
being
used
by
or
within
the
confines
of
a
religious
institution
in
connection
with
functions
associated
with
religion.
having
determined
that
the
funds
--
that
the
benefit
was
marked
off
from
the
religious
function,
the
court
concluded
new
jersey
did
not
support
religion,
although
justice
rutledge
agreed
to
the
definition
of
the
scope
of
the
establishment
clause,
he
disagreed
with
the
majority's
conclusion
that
the
busing
law
did
not
support
religion.
for
him,
the
primary
reason
children
was
sent
to
a
church
school
was
to
obtain
a
religious
education.
the
payment
of
transportation
not
only
helped
them
get
there
and
their
parents
to
send
them,
but
it
aided
them
in
this
objective.
and
any
aid
to
religion
was
outlawed
and
was
intended
to
be
outlawed.
the
dual
prohibitions
for
justice
rutledge
to
the
first
amendment
made
religion
a
private
matter
and
it
could
not
be
made
public
by
legislation.
the
question
of
whether
the
tax
funds
or
funds
were
raised
for
a
public
purpose
was
for
him
a
false
issue,
clouding
a
real
issue
of
the
first
amendment
span.
in
summary,
everson
said
as
i
read
the
case
that
busing
or
the
providing
of
bus
transportation
approached
the
verge
of
new
jersey's
constitutional
power
but
that
it
was
permissible
because
it
was
separate
and
marked
off
from
the
religious
function
of
the
church
school.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
that
the
--
if
the
majority
opinion
were
accepted
in
everson,
it
would
require
that
textbooks
--
textbook
aids
would
be
prohibited.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
would
stand
on
the
majority
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct,
your
honor,
i
would.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
in
this
case,
a
textbook,
unlike
bus
transportation,
is
not
separate
and
marked
off
from
the
primary
function
of
a
church
school,
which
is
the
teaching
of
religion.
the
very
opposite
is
true
that
transportation
takes
children
to
the
door
of
a
school
but
textbook
aid
spills
over
to
the
classroom.
a
textbook
is
an
integral
part
of
the
educational
process
which
takes
place
in
a
church
school.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor.
i
do
not
think
it
has
--
relates
at
all
to
the
educational
process
which
takes
place
in
the
school.
and
i
think
that's
the
difference
between
giving
textbooks
and
giving
bus
transportation.
textbooks
are
an
essential
element
of
education.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
would
think
assuming
there
was
no
proselytizing
in
connection
with
him
--
with
these
benefits
i
would
say
that
the
benefits
were
not
impermissible
because
while
they
might
be
used
in
a
religious
institution,
the
benefits,
they
are
not
used
in
connection
with
the
teaching
of
religion,
which
is
the
primary
function
of
these
schools.
they
are
not
connected
to
the
teaching
of
the
tenants
of
that
church
which
is
the
primary
mission
of
that
school.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
a
textbook,
unlike
a
reference
book
or
a
book
in
general
is
not
intended
to
be
used
by
a
student
alone
as
a
rule.
its
contents
cannot
be
fully
utilized
until
subjected
to
the
interpretation
and
analysis
of
a
teacher.
the
book
is
used
in
a
place
where
the
syllabus
that
teacher,
the
curriculum
and
the
whole
atmosphere
is
oriented
toward
a
religious
objective.
the
fact
that
it's
secular
makes
no
difference.
it
makes
no
difference
because
if
the
states
supply
desks,
blackboards,
chairs,
or
other
so-called
secular
items
of
education,
it
would
still
be
aiding
in
the
educational
process
which
takes
place
in
the
school.
these
are
other
items
which
are
directly
related
to
the
educational
process
taking
place
in
the
school.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
it
would
not
include
school
lunches.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
do
not
think
it
would
include
health
facilities.
again,
if
the
aid
is
not
used
in
connection
with
functions
associated
with
religion,
it
does
not
necessarily
fall
--
it
would
depend
i
assume
on
whether
--
well,
if
it
doesn't,
if
it's
not
used
in
connection
with
functions
associated
with
religion,
it
would
not
be
impermissible.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
it
would
be,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
one
is
related
to
a
health
matter
and
i
think
it
is
more
like
health
than
like
a
tool
in
the
educational
process.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
again
that
our
position
has
been
that
certain
kinds
of
benefits
which
are
not
directly
related
to
the
teaching
process
which
goes
on
in
that
school
are
permissible.
these
would
include
some
health
measures
--
i
think
the
in-school
dental
treatment,
in-school
medical
treatment,
those
programs
are
usually
not
susceptible
to
the
kind
of
proselytizing
that
goes
on
in
connection
with
what
goes
on
in
the
classroom.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
if
it
had
to
do
with
the
teaching
process
and
forwarded
that
and
it
was
connected
with
the
teaching
process,
whatever
the
item
is
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
the
posture
chairs
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
with
the
textbooks,
we
have
no
problem.
i
think
textbooks
are
quite
different
than
a
chair.
and
i
think
again,
you
can
get
into
many
categories.
one,
you
can
talk
about
medical
items.
you
can
talk
about
physical
items
that
is
--
such
as
a
posture
chair,
but
i
think
here,
we're
talking
about
one
of
the
three
essentials
of
a
school.
a
school
cannot
do
without
pupils,
teachers,
and
textbooks.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
no,
it
can't
do
without
pupils
in
the
school,
your
honor.
i
think
too,
the
one
thing
that's
important
to
observe
is
that
a
church
school
--
that
if
books
are
an
integral
part
of
the
educational
process
and
a
church
school
is
a
religious
institution,
then
the
furnishing
of
books
constituted
--
constitutes
a
use
of
tax
raised
funds
for
the
support
of
religion.
i
think
that
textbooks
are
indeed
an
integral
part
of
what
takes
place
inside
of
a
church
school.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
no
evidence
in
the
record
at
all.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
i
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
--
the
basic
purpose
of
a
church
school
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
don't
know
that
it
is.
i
--
i
think
it's
less
--
less
tough
that
idea
of
giving
a
religious
missile
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
well,
i
think
the
religious
--
as
i
understand
it,
the
basic
purpose
of
a
church
school
is
to
teach
religion.
for
example,
in
justice
jackson's
dissenting
opinion
in
everson,
he
referred
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
are
we
going
to
accept
the
moment
that
a
church
school
is
a
religious
institution
and
that
it's
dedicated
to
furthering
only
religious
objectives?
because
if
we
accept
that
i
think,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
textbooks
cannot
be
given
to
a
church
school.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
nor
anything
else
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
--
that's
related
to
the
educational
process
of
the
school.
that's
all
we're
asking
here.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
as
i
understand
it,
the
basic
purpose
of
a
school,
of
a
religious
school
is
the
teaching
of
the
tenants
and
faith
of
the
church
in
all
courses
and
in
everything.
and
i
think
that
any
educational
aid
that's
given
to
them
is
used
to
further
that
mission.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
--
as
i
understand
it,
no
one
has
denied
that
a
church
school
is
a
religious
institution,
that
it's
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
understand
that
there
are
--
there
are
people
of
other
faiths
sometimes
in
a
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
understand
they
do
survive.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
that
the
orientation
in
these
schools
--
the
basic
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
not
a
course
called
religion
but
i
think
that
the
concepts
of
the
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
don't
know
that
they're
required
to
maintain.
they
are
required
to
meet,
as
i
understand
it,
certain
minimum
standards.
i
don't
know
the
amount
of
oversee
and
supervision
in
this
connection,
so
i
can't
say.
they
are
required
to
meet
certain
minimum
requirements,
but
they
can
do
so.
as
i
understand
it,
the
law
is
liberally
applied
to
permit
them
to
do
so.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
primarily
they
do.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
that
the
effect
of
the
law
is
to
(a)
that
the
teaching
process
which
goes
on
in
this
school,
and
i
think
that
the
principal
teaching
process
is
the
teaching
of
religion.
i
do
not
think
--
i
think
that
religion
permeates
at
a
religious
school
and
everything
that's
taught
there.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
including
geometry,
and
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
that
if
you
--
the
kind
is
for
example,
with
respect
to
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
so.
i
don't
know
whether
this
court
has
taken
judicial
notice.
i
think
the
courts
thus
far
have.
i
think
for
example,
the
kind
of
law
the
church
--
relating
to
church
schools
for
the
catholic
church
will,
one
example,
provide
--
which
i
understand
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
religious
institution,
that's
correct.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
don't
know.
i
would
not
--
i
would
say
that
any
school
chartered
as
a
religious
school
would
fall
within
the
ban.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct.
i
think
there
are
special
laws
that
cover
these.
i
think
that
any
--
i
think
it's
clear
where
a
school
is
connected
with
a
sect
and
there
may
be
some
cases
where
it
might
be
difficult
to
determine
whether
there
is
some
formal
sect
in
action.
but
i
think
in
most
cases,
it
isn't,
that
it's
clear
that
this
school
is
operated
as
a
part
of
the
church.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
because
i
would
say
that
does
not
further
the
education
--
that's
not
connected
with
the
educational
process
of
the
school
and
i'd
say
that
that
is
the
difference
but
it
does
in
further
religion.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that
is
correct.
and
i
would
say
functions
that
aide
religion
teaching
out
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
yes
i
do.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
no
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
no
your
honor.
this
statute
applies
to
--
as
i
understand
it
to
junior
high
school
students
alone
--
so
of
course
--
this
would
cover
children
in
12-year-old
to
16-year-old.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
can't
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
tax
exemptions
is
something
that
had
been
imbedded
in
our
history
and
perhaps
due
to
lack
of
taxpayer
standing
or
litigants
in
some
cases,
they
haven't
been
raised
in
other
cases
of
--
they
have
existed
and
i
don't
distinguish.
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
except
of
course
an
exemption
is
not
a
direct
grant
of
money,
so
negative,
yes.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
no,
i
don't
your
honor.
i
think
you
could
limit
yourself
in
this
case
by
giving
of
textbooks.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
your
honor,
i
haven't
gone.
i
haven't
explored
the
question
of
tax
exemption
in
this
case.
it's
not
been
an
issue
and
i
don't
pretend
to
be
an
authority
on
it.
the
--
what
we're
asserting
here
is
that
textbooks
which
are
given
for
use
in
a
church
school
violate
the
constitution.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
in
this
case
--
i
would
argue
only
in
this
case.
the
issue
here
is
whether
a
textbook
should
be
given
to
parochial
schools.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
the
definition
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
the
principle
could
be
i
think
narrowly
drawn
if
necessary
in
this
case
to
outlaw
textbooks
only.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
suggest
that
the
rule
that
the
text
--
that
giving
of
textbooks
for
use
in
church
schools
violates
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment
on
a
ground
that
it
constitutes
a
use
of
tax
funds
for
the
support
of
religion.
now,
that
is
the
rule
i'm
suggesting
that
this
court
adopt.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct.
i
have
reserved
ten
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
although
that's
not
involved
in
this
case,
i
would
say
that
if
it
were
given
for
use
in
connection
with
the
teaching
functions
in
the
school,
the
further
the
mission
of
the
school,
teaching
the
tenants
in
the
face
of
its
religion,
it
would
not
be
permitted.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
yes
your
honor
that
would
go
for
blackboard--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct
your
honor
to
church
schools.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
your
honor.
in
this
dissenting
opinion
in
everson,
justice
jackson
set
forth
the
cannonball
of
the
church
relating
to
catholic
schools
by
which
all
catholics
were
bound
so
far
as
i
know,
these
are
still
the
cannonball
of
the
church
relating
to
church
schools.
one
of
those
cannons
reads
as
follows.
catholic
children
are
to
be
educated
at
schools
where
not
only
nothing
contrary
to
catholic
faith
and
morals
is
thought
but
rather
in
schools
where
religious
and
world
training
occupy
the
first
place.
i
like
to
comment
too
on
something
that
mrs.
coon
said
having
to
do
with
the
pupil
request
under
the
statute
of
the
pupil
that
requested
the
books.
the
way
the
statute
is
first
written.
it
did
not
contain
the
definition
of
textbooks
and
requested
one
would
have
to
ask
is
what
role
can
a
12-year-old
play
the
selection
of
books
which
he's
going
to
use
it
in
school.
the
way
the
statute
read
then,
it
would
have
to
be
argued
that
the
student
could
go
to
the
school
board
and
ask
for
any
book
and
any
number
of
books
so
long
as
they
were
books
designated
for
use.
but
the
statute
was
amended
to
make
clear
that
the
only
book
as
student
could
request
is
one
which
is
legally
required
to
use
as
a
text
for
a
semester
more
in
a
school
he
legally
attends
making
it
absolutely
clear
that
it
is
this
school
that
is
ordering
the
books.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
say
briefly
that
there
are
many
advocates
of
aide
to
parochial
school
who
seek
to
further
purely
the
religious
objectives
by
masking
their
appeal
for
funds
in
the
rectory
for
public
purpose.
thus,
their
appeals
many
times
are
wrapped
in
the
mantle
of
the
educational
problem
or
poverty
problem.
while
no
one
would
dispute
the
need
for
these
programs,
we
must
be
careful
not
to
sacrifice
constitutional
principles
in
the
process.
the
principle
in
church
and
state
separate
has
served
this
nation
well
attesting
to
the
wisdom
of
those
who
fought
hardest
for
its
acceptance
in
our
constitution.
it
is
part
of
our
fabric
not
because
we
paid
the
lip
service
but
because
we
continue
to
give
it
vitality.
we
should
not
permit
the
principle
to
be
eroded
by
mouthing
its
words
while
stripping
it
of
all
significance.
i
submit
that
this
court
should
rule
that
the
furnishing
of
textbooks
by
the
state
of
new
york
with
funds
raised
by
taxation
constitutes
a
use
of
state
funds
to
a
religion
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
thank
you.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
where
a
consonant
with
the
religious
clauses
of
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
state
of
new
york
may
furnish
textbooks
purchased
with
tax
raised
funds
for
use
in
religious
schools.
the
material
facts
in
the
case
are
not
in
dispute.
prior
to
1965,
section
701
of
the
new
york
education
law,
authorized
local
school
boards
to
purchase
textbooks
and
either
to
loan
or
sell
them
to
pupils
in
the
public
schools
in
the
state.
in
1965,
the
provisions
relating
to
textbooks
in
section
701
were
amended
effective
september
1,
1966.
the
effect
of
the
amendment
was
to
turn
a
permissive
practice
into
a
mandatory
one
and
to
extend
the
coverage
of
the
law
to
private
schools.
under
the
law
as
amended,
each
school
board
in
new
york
must
purchase
and
long
free
of
charge
to
all
children
residing
in
its
district
enrolled
in
a
grade
from
7
through
12
of
an
accredited
public
or
private
school
any
textbook
requested
by
the
child
so
long
as
the
textbook
was
one
designated
for
use
in
any
public
school
in
the
state
or
by
any
school
board
in
the
state.
as
originally
enacted,
the
law
contained
no
limit
on
the
number
of
books
required
to
be
purchased
and
no
limit
on
the
amount
of
money
that
had
to
be
spent
for
the
books
by
the
local
school
district.
it
did
however
provide
for
state
reimbursement
or
state
allocation
to
the
extent
of
$10.00
a
pupil.
in
the
view
of
the
east
greenbush
school
board
which
had
children
residing
in
its
district
who
were
enrolled
in
grade
7
through
12
accredited
private
religious
schools.
the
provisions
of
section
701
as
amended
violated
both
the
new
york
state
constitution
and
the
first
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
both
of
which
each
member
had
sworn
to
uphold.
failure
to
implement
the
law
on
a
part
of
this
board
would
have
subjected
the
members
a
removal
from
office
and
also
would
have
subjected
the
school
district
to
a
loss
of
state
funds.
to
resolve
this
conflict,
the
greenbush
school
board
filed
an
action
in
the
supreme
court
albany
county.
the
relief
sought
in
the
complaint
was
a
judgment
declaring
the
textbook
law
to
the
extent
that
related
to
church
schools
unconstitutional
and
in
violation
to
both
the
new
york
state
constitution
on
the
first
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution.
it
also
sought
an
order
in
joining
the
state
commissioner
of
education
from
implementing
the
provisions
of
the
law.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
these
boards
have
raised
no
constitutional
objection.
after
the
suit
was
filed
and
the
suit
incidentally
was
filed
april
29,
1966
which
is
about
four
month
before
the
law
was
to
go
into
effect,
after
the
suit
was
filed,
the
textbook
law
was
further
amended
in
two
respects.
the
first
respect
was
to
reduce
the
financial
book
on
the
local
school
boards.
the
second
respect
was
to
define
a
textbook
as
used
in
the
statute
to
mean
a
book
which
a
student
is
required
to
use
as
a
text
for
a
semester
or
more
in
a
school
he
legally
attends.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
in
a
school
he
legally
attends.
the
state
answered
the
complaint,
did
not
raise
any
material
issue
of
fact
but
did
deny
the
allegations
relating
to
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
law.
the
state
also
raised
a
number
of
affirmative
offenses,
principal
one
of
which
was
that
the
greenbush
school
board
lacks
standing
to
sue
on
the
ground
that
it
was
an
instrumentality
of
the
state
and
could
not
challenge
state
law.
after
issue
was
joined,
five
parents
of
children
who
resided
in
the
east
greenbush
school
board
were
permitted
to
intervene
in
the
action.
in
their
answer,
they
too
did
not
raise
any
material
issue
of
fact
but
did
deny
the
allegations
of
unconstitutionality
of
the
law.
and
in
addition,
they
raised
a
number
of
affirmative
defenses.
the
thrust
of
these
defenses
was
that
to
deny
the
books
to
them
and
their
children
while
permitting
the
furnishing
of
these
books
to
pupils
attending
private
nonsectarian
schools
constituted
an
interference
with
the
free
exercise
of
their
religion
and
a
denial
of
due
process
and
equal
protection.
all
parties
then
move
for
judgment.
in
substance,
judgment
on
the
pleading,
they
were
in
all
affidavits.
at
the
time
of
oral
argument,
the
board
of
education
of
union
free
school
district
no.
3
was
joined
as
a
party
plaintiff
and
was
deemed
to
have
adopted
all
the
pleadings
in
the
case.
the
supreme
court
albany
county
granted
the
plaintiff's
cross-motion
for
judgment.
it
ruled
that
the
greenbush
--
the
two
school
boards
had
standing
to
sue,
and
also
that
the
law
as
amended
in
1965
and
in
1966
violated
the
state
constitution
and
both
the
establishment
of
free
exercise
clauses
of
the
federal
constitution
and
a
judgment
was
entered
to
that
effect
which
among
other
things
enjoined
the
state
from
implementing
the
statute.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
appellant
division,
third
department.
three
of
the
justices
constituting
a
majority
of
that
court
voted
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
albany
county
and
dismiss
the
complaint
on
the
sole
ground
that
the
appellants
lack
standing
to
sue.
two
remaining
justices
would
have
found
that
the
appellants
had
standing
and
would
have
voted
to
reverse
on
the
merits.
they
would
have
found
a
law
constitutional
in
all
respects.
the
case
was
then
appealed
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
that
court
reached
the
merits
of
the
action.
it
ruled
that
the
appellants
had
standing
to
sue.
and
by
a
four-to-three
vote,
it
ruled
that
the
textbook
law
as
amended
did
not
violate
state
constitution,
did
not
violate
the
establishment
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.
approximately
20
years
ago,
this
court
for
the
first
time
defined
the
scope
of
the
establishment
clause's
coverage.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
as
far
as
i
know,
i
would
rest
on
the
record.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
said
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
since
the
standing
has
been
decided
and
no
issue
has
been
raised
by
the
appellees.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
no,
it
need
not,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
i
think
this
case
comes
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
well,
i
didn't
understand
it
that
way,
your
honor.
i
--
as
i
understood
it,
they
ruled
that
a
state
board
is
not
–
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
as
i
understand,
the
ruling
of
the
court
on
the
standing
question,
they
said
that
the
state
board
has
standing
to
sue
and
to
challenge
to
the
state
law.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
well,
as
far
as
i
can
say
here,
i
think
if
they
went
ahead
and
violated
the
federal
constitution,
it
is
quite
conceivable
that
they
might
be
subject
to
other
liabilities
which
have
not
so
far
been
asserted.
i
would
think
that
they
might
have
taxpayer
cases
exposure
if
they're
spending
federal
funds
in
violation
of
the
federal
constitution
or
spending
state
funds
in
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
so
i
don't
think
the
case
would
be
at
an
end
on
that
question.
i
think
that
they're
not
out
of
the
dilemma
yet
and
i
would
think
that
if
--
until
the
federal
question
was
decided,
this
would
be
an
open
question.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
would
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
there
are
people
in
these
school
districts
who
might
well
attack
the
active
spending
funds
in
violation
of
the
--
of
what
they
deem
to
be
in
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
and
that
might
raise
the
involved
issue
again
so
that
they
would
then
be
in
jeopardy.
they
would
have
the
same
dilemma
that
is
to
risk
the
violation
and
to
spend
the
funds
or
not
to
risk
the
violation.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
--
i'm
not
saying
that
it's
clear
on
the
law.
i
think
justice
van
voorhis
pointed
this
out
in
his
dissent
on
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
the
regulations
are
attached
as
an
appendix
to
the
appellant's
brief
beginning
at
page
4a.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
in
part
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
in
part,
it
is.
the
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
don't
think
that
they
raised
the
question.
they
assumed
that
the
books
would
be
secular.
i
think
that
they're
saying
that
the
statute
--
construing
the
statute
to
require
the
giving
of
secular
books
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
--
as
designated
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
understand,
your
honor.
i
think
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
as
i
understand
it,
did
not
get
into
that
question.
they
just
said
that
the
books
would
be
prescribed
by
public
authorities
without
--
i
don't
think
that
they
found
any
problem
with
the
language
of
the
statutes
in
majority
of
places.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
that
would
raise
a
definite
problem,
your
honor.
and
as
i
said,
justice
van
voorhis
was
bothered
with
that
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
majority
i
think
this
one
had
on
the
basis
that
the
statute
meant
to
them
that
it
was
the
public
authorities
who
designated
the
book.
they
did
not
do
anything
more
than
quote
the
language
of
the
statute
as
i
read
the
opinion
and
said
that
this
is
what
it
is,
that
the
public
authorities
are
the
ones
that
designate
the
books.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
what
--
i
don't
know
why.
i
think
that
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
for
federal
questions
involved
in
this
case,
i
don't
know
why
we
should
bound
here
by
the
construction
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
did
and
i've
read
that
opinion
and
i
don't
know
that
it
did.
i
think
it
cited
the
statute
and
then
said
that
they
went
into
the
secularity
of
the
books
but
didn't
do
anything
more
than
that.
as
i
understand
it
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
that's
what
it
said.
that's
what
it
said
the
statue
has.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
again,
if
i
may
read
from
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
they
say
that
only
textbooks
designated
for
use
by
the
public
schools
are
approved
by
boards
of
education,
trustees
or
school
authorities
may
be
lent
and
inside
the
statute.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct.
they
do
not
go
on
to
say
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
they
do
not
define
that
in
this
opinion.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct.
i
don't
think
the
court
did
define
that
in
the
opinion.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
well,
i
would
say
that
we
could
assume
here
that
the
books
are
designated
by
the
public
authorities
and
not
the
parochial
schools
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
religious
authorities
of
the
parochial
schools.
we
could
assume
that
and
still
find
the
statute
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
don't
think
so
but
i
think
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
you
ought
to
take
the
position
that
the
statute
is
vague
and
is
susceptible
of
the
construction
of
the
parochial
schools
may
actually
designate
the
books.
i
think
in
implementation,
this
is
probably
how
in
part
it
could
work
out
anyhow.
but
i
think
that
even
if
the
statute
is
not
construed
that
way,
i
think
that
the
law
is
still
bad
so
that
i
would
be
satisfied
if
this
court
were
to
construe
the
statute
to
mean
that
the
public
authorities
designate
the
books.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
have
not.
i
have
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
have
maybe
--
i
have
assumed
that's
the
case,
but
i
have
also
argued
that
religious
schools
may
play
a
role
in
the
selection
–
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
may
play
--
the
religious
schools
may
play
a
role
in
the
selection
of
books.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
in
the
selection
of
books.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
well,
prescribed
by
the
public
authorities,
but
i
have
argued
that
the
public
authorities
in
many
cases
consist
of
a
board
of
education
elected
by
the
residence
of
the
particular
school
district
and
in
some
cases,
i
think
where
--
particularly
where
some
religious
group
has
let's
say
an
ethnic
majority,
they
do
have
power
to
elect
the
people
to
the
board
who
are
more
prone
to
follow
their
views.
and
once
this
board
is
elected
and
does
have
the
power
to
designate
books,
it
would
not
be
unusual
to
have
these
books.
these
boards
designate
books
which
are
not
contrary
to
the
face
which
they
hold.
i
think
to
that
extent,
you
have
some
involvement
or
some
possibility
of
involvement.
so
whether
the
books
are
designated
by
a
public
authority,
the
public
authority
itself
is
made
up
of
people.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
i
quarrel
with
the
statement
that
it
makes
it
plain.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
trustees
of
a
board
of
education
or
corresponding
officers,
whether
one
or
more
and
by
whatever
name
known
of
a
city
school
district
or
other
school
districts
however
created.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
yes,
there
is.
the
term
school
authorities
means
that
trustees
or
board
of
education
or
corresponding
officers,
whether
one
or
more
and
by
whatever
name
known
of
a
city
school
district
or
other
school
districts
however
created.
now
that
that
might
--
that
would
define,
presumably
define
school
authorities.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
yes,
it
would.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct.
that
would
define
the
term
“school
authorities”.
but
not
define
the
term
boards
of
education
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
take
it
that
there
is
a
question
in
my
mind,
and
i
don't
know
that
anybody
can
solve
it
by
even
going
to
the
construction
laws
to
whether
or
not
the
books
must
be
designated
by
a
public
authority.
i
think
there's
some
question
in
the
statute
and
i
think
even
if
there
is
no
question,
that
there
is
--
the
books
must
be
designated
for
use
by
a
public
authority,
i
think
you
still
have
the
problem
that
the
public
authority
could
consist
of
eight
board
of
education
anywhere
in
the
state
who
has
the
right
to
designate
books.
and
i
think
i
have
suggested
in
my
brief
that
this
does
make
the
act
susceptible
to
parochial
interference.
if
a
school
board
is
dominated
by
a
faith,
it
can
designate
books
for
use.
then,
school
boards
anywhere
else
in
the
state
or
children
anywhere
else
in
the
state
can
order
that
book.
and
once
the
book
is
on
the
list
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that
is
my
construction
of
the
statute.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
yes.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
yes,
it
is.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
yes,
it
is.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
it
could
happen.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
but
i
think
in
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
it
could
well
happen.
i
think
what's
happened
in
a
good
many
of
the
school
districts
in
new
york,
textbooks
are
not
supplied
by
the
schools.
and
i
think
where
you
have
tax
funds
raised
to
be
spent
for
books
you
might
have
more
action
in
this
area
if
you
do
at
present.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct.
the
same
problem
would
exist
and
that
would
be
the
one
step.
i
have
posed
the
two
step
situation,
but
that
would
be
an
infirmity
in
spending
in
that
instance,
too.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
no,
i
think
that
would
--
we
would
have
to
--
we
would
have
to
find
out
what
the
--
where
the
public
funds
are
being
used.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
they
have
a
right
of
oversee
generally.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
they
have
a
right
of
supervision
of
all
the
local
board
and
boards
of
education.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
take
it
that
they
would
decide
questions
of
as
to
whether
a
particular
book
ought
to
be
used
or
should
not
be
used.
they
would
be
the
ultimate
authority
on
it
i
see
on
that
connection.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
it
is.
i
think
the
counsel
is
charged
with
the
implementation
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
yes,
there
is.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
these
have
the
--
these
have
binding
force
on
the
school
boards
throughout
the
state,
the
opinion
of
counsel,
i
understand.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
it
was
issued
after
the
case
was
argued
about
it.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
in
the
everson
case,
which
was
decided
by
this
court
20
years
ago,
the
court
defined
the
scope
of
the
establishment
clause
as
coverage.
the
definition
consisted
of
seven
sentences
that
appears
at
330
us
15
and
is
quoted
at
page
10
of
appellant's
brief.
one
of
the
sentences
reads
that
no
tax
in
any
amount,
large
or
small,
can
be
levied
to
support
any
religious
activities
or
institutions
whatever
they
may
be
called
or
whatever
form
they
may
adopt
to
teach
or
practice
religion.
while
four
justices
in
that
case
disagreed
with
the
application
of
that
definition
to
the
facts
of
everson,
all
of
the
justices
agreed
with
the
definition,
and
the
definition
has
been
repeated
and
reaffirmed
at
least
three
times,
once
unanimously
until
a
castle
against
watkins
in
1961.
in
applying
the
everson
definition
to
the
facts
of
the
case,
the
majority
started
out
by
saying
that
state
legislation
should
not
be
overturned
if
it
was
within
the
state's
constitutional
power
even
though
it
approached
the
verge
of
that
power.
said
on
the
one
hand
new
jersey
could
not,
consistent
with
the
establishment
clause,
contribute
tax
funds
for
the
support
of
any
religious
institution
which
teaches
the
tenants
in
faiths
of
any
church.
presumably
here,
it
had
in
mind
church
schools.
on
the
other
hand,
new
jersey
could
not
interfere
with
the
free
exercise
of
religion
by
their
citizens
such
as
by
excluding
believers
or
non-believers
because
of
their
faith
or
lack
of
it
from
the
benefits
of
any
welfare
legislation.
but
the
issue
does
pose
it
remained
only
for
the
majority
there
to
determine
the
nature
of
the
benefit,
which
was
bus
transportation,
of
where
and
how
it
was
used.
and
it
determined
that
bus
transportation
was
like
certain
other
government
services
such
as
police
and
fire
protection,
sewage
disposal,
streets
and
highways.
the
reason
that
it
was
no
different
than
these
other
services
the
court
suggested
was
that
it
was
separate
and
indisputably
marked
off
from
the
primary
function
of
the
school,
which
was
the
teaching
of
religion.
in
other
words,
funds,
tax
funds
were
not
being
used
by
or
within
the
confines
of
a
religious
institution
in
connection
with
functions
associated
with
religion.
having
determined
that
the
funds
--
that
the
benefit
was
marked
off
from
the
religious
function,
the
court
concluded
new
jersey
did
not
support
religion,
although
justice
rutledge
agreed
to
the
definition
of
the
scope
of
the
establishment
clause,
he
disagreed
with
the
majority's
conclusion
that
the
busing
law
did
not
support
religion.
for
him,
the
primary
reason
children
was
sent
to
a
church
school
was
to
obtain
a
religious
education.
the
payment
of
transportation
not
only
helped
them
get
there
and
their
parents
to
send
them,
but
it
aided
them
in
this
objective.
and
any
aid
to
religion
was
outlawed
and
was
intended
to
be
outlawed.
the
dual
prohibitions
for
justice
rutledge
to
the
first
amendment
made
religion
a
private
matter
and
it
could
not
be
made
public
by
legislation.
the
question
of
whether
the
tax
funds
or
funds
were
raised
for
a
public
purpose
was
for
him
a
false
issue,
clouding
a
real
issue
of
the
first
amendment
span.
in
summary,
everson
said
as
i
read
the
case
that
busing
or
the
providing
of
bus
transportation
approached
the
verge
of
new
jersey's
constitutional
power
but
that
it
was
permissible
because
it
was
separate
and
marked
off
from
the
religious
function
of
the
church
school.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
that
the
--
if
the
majority
opinion
were
accepted
in
everson,
it
would
require
that
textbooks
--
textbook
aids
would
be
prohibited.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
would
stand
on
the
majority
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct,
your
honor,
i
would.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
in
this
case,
a
textbook,
unlike
bus
transportation,
is
not
separate
and
marked
off
from
the
primary
function
of
a
church
school,
which
is
the
teaching
of
religion.
the
very
opposite
is
true
that
transportation
takes
children
to
the
door
of
a
school
but
textbook
aid
spills
over
to
the
classroom.
a
textbook
is
an
integral
part
of
the
educational
process
which
takes
place
in
a
church
school.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor.
i
do
not
think
it
has
--
relates
at
all
to
the
educational
process
which
takes
place
in
the
school.
and
i
think
that's
the
difference
between
giving
textbooks
and
giving
bus
transportation.
textbooks
are
an
essential
element
of
education.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
would
think
assuming
there
was
no
proselytizing
in
connection
with
him
--
with
these
benefits
i
would
say
that
the
benefits
were
not
impermissible
because
while
they
might
be
used
in
a
religious
institution,
the
benefits,
they
are
not
used
in
connection
with
the
teaching
of
religion,
which
is
the
primary
function
of
these
schools.
they
are
not
connected
to
the
teaching
of
the
tenants
of
that
church
which
is
the
primary
mission
of
that
school.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
a
textbook,
unlike
a
reference
book
or
a
book
in
general
is
not
intended
to
be
used
by
a
student
alone
as
a
rule.
its
contents
cannot
be
fully
utilized
until
subjected
to
the
interpretation
and
analysis
of
a
teacher.
the
book
is
used
in
a
place
where
the
syllabus
that
teacher,
the
curriculum
and
the
whole
atmosphere
is
oriented
toward
a
religious
objective.
the
fact
that
it's
secular
makes
no
difference.
it
makes
no
difference
because
if
the
states
supply
desks,
blackboards,
chairs,
or
other
so-called
secular
items
of
education,
it
would
still
be
aiding
in
the
educational
process
which
takes
place
in
the
school.
these
are
other
items
which
are
directly
related
to
the
educational
process
taking
place
in
the
school.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
it
would
not
include
school
lunches.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
do
not
think
it
would
include
health
facilities.
again,
if
the
aid
is
not
used
in
connection
with
functions
associated
with
religion,
it
does
not
necessarily
fall
--
it
would
depend
i
assume
on
whether
--
well,
if
it
doesn't,
if
it's
not
used
in
connection
with
functions
associated
with
religion,
it
would
not
be
impermissible.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
it
would
be,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
one
is
related
to
a
health
matter
and
i
think
it
is
more
like
health
than
like
a
tool
in
the
educational
process.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
again
that
our
position
has
been
that
certain
kinds
of
benefits
which
are
not
directly
related
to
the
teaching
process
which
goes
on
in
that
school
are
permissible.
these
would
include
some
health
measures
--
i
think
the
in-school
dental
treatment,
in-school
medical
treatment,
those
programs
are
usually
not
susceptible
to
the
kind
of
proselytizing
that
goes
on
in
connection
with
what
goes
on
in
the
classroom.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
if
it
had
to
do
with
the
teaching
process
and
forwarded
that
and
it
was
connected
with
the
teaching
process,
whatever
the
item
is
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
the
posture
chairs
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
with
the
textbooks,
we
have
no
problem.
i
think
textbooks
are
quite
different
than
a
chair.
and
i
think
again,
you
can
get
into
many
categories.
one,
you
can
talk
about
medical
items.
you
can
talk
about
physical
items
that
is
--
such
as
a
posture
chair,
but
i
think
here,
we're
talking
about
one
of
the
three
essentials
of
a
school.
a
school
cannot
do
without
pupils,
teachers,
and
textbooks.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
no,
it
can't
do
without
pupils
in
the
school,
your
honor.
i
think
too,
the
one
thing
that's
important
to
observe
is
that
a
church
school
--
that
if
books
are
an
integral
part
of
the
educational
process
and
a
church
school
is
a
religious
institution,
then
the
furnishing
of
books
constituted
--
constitutes
a
use
of
tax
raised
funds
for
the
support
of
religion.
i
think
that
textbooks
are
indeed
an
integral
part
of
what
takes
place
inside
of
a
church
school.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
no
evidence
in
the
record
at
all.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
i
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
--
the
basic
purpose
of
a
church
school
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
don't
know
that
it
is.
i
--
i
think
it's
less
--
less
tough
that
idea
of
giving
a
religious
missile
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
well,
i
think
the
religious
--
as
i
understand
it,
the
basic
purpose
of
a
church
school
is
to
teach
religion.
for
example,
in
justice
jackson's
dissenting
opinion
in
everson,
he
referred
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
are
we
going
to
accept
the
moment
that
a
church
school
is
a
religious
institution
and
that
it's
dedicated
to
furthering
only
religious
objectives?
because
if
we
accept
that
i
think,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
textbooks
cannot
be
given
to
a
church
school.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
nor
anything
else
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
--
that's
related
to
the
educational
process
of
the
school.
that's
all
we're
asking
here.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
as
i
understand
it,
the
basic
purpose
of
a
school,
of
a
religious
school
is
the
teaching
of
the
tenants
and
faith
of
the
church
in
all
courses
and
in
everything.
and
i
think
that
any
educational
aid
that's
given
to
them
is
used
to
further
that
mission.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
--
as
i
understand
it,
no
one
has
denied
that
a
church
school
is
a
religious
institution,
that
it's
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
understand
that
there
are
--
there
are
people
of
other
faiths
sometimes
in
a
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
understand
they
do
survive.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
that
the
orientation
in
these
schools
--
the
basic
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
not
a
course
called
religion
but
i
think
that
the
concepts
of
the
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
don't
know
that
they're
required
to
maintain.
they
are
required
to
meet,
as
i
understand
it,
certain
minimum
standards.
i
don't
know
the
amount
of
oversee
and
supervision
in
this
connection,
so
i
can't
say.
they
are
required
to
meet
certain
minimum
requirements,
but
they
can
do
so.
as
i
understand
it,
the
law
is
liberally
applied
to
permit
them
to
do
so.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
primarily
they
do.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
that
the
effect
of
the
law
is
to
(a)
that
the
teaching
process
which
goes
on
in
this
school,
and
i
think
that
the
principal
teaching
process
is
the
teaching
of
religion.
i
do
not
think
--
i
think
that
religion
permeates
at
a
religious
school
and
everything
that's
taught
there.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
including
geometry,
and
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
that
if
you
--
the
kind
is
for
example,
with
respect
to
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
think
so.
i
don't
know
whether
this
court
has
taken
judicial
notice.
i
think
the
courts
thus
far
have.
i
think
for
example,
the
kind
of
law
the
church
--
relating
to
church
schools
for
the
catholic
church
will,
one
example,
provide
--
which
i
understand
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
religious
institution,
that's
correct.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
don't
know.
i
would
not
--
i
would
say
that
any
school
chartered
as
a
religious
school
would
fall
within
the
ban.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct.
i
think
there
are
special
laws
that
cover
these.
i
think
that
any
--
i
think
it's
clear
where
a
school
is
connected
with
a
sect
and
there
may
be
some
cases
where
it
might
be
difficult
to
determine
whether
there
is
some
formal
sect
in
action.
but
i
think
in
most
cases,
it
isn't,
that
it's
clear
that
this
school
is
operated
as
a
part
of
the
church.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
because
i
would
say
that
does
not
further
the
education
--
that's
not
connected
with
the
educational
process
of
the
school
and
i'd
say
that
that
is
the
difference
but
it
does
in
further
religion.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that
is
correct.
and
i
would
say
functions
that
aide
religion
teaching
out
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
yes
i
do.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
no
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
no
your
honor.
this
statute
applies
to
--
as
i
understand
it
to
junior
high
school
students
alone
--
so
of
course
--
this
would
cover
children
in
12-year-old
to
16-year-old.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
can't
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
tax
exemptions
is
something
that
had
been
imbedded
in
our
history
and
perhaps
due
to
lack
of
taxpayer
standing
or
litigants
in
some
cases,
they
haven't
been
raised
in
other
cases
of
--
they
have
existed
and
i
don't
distinguish.
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
except
of
course
an
exemption
is
not
a
direct
grant
of
money,
so
negative,
yes.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
no,
i
don't
your
honor.
i
think
you
could
limit
yourself
in
this
case
by
giving
of
textbooks.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
your
honor,
i
haven't
gone.
i
haven't
explored
the
question
of
tax
exemption
in
this
case.
it's
not
been
an
issue
and
i
don't
pretend
to
be
an
authority
on
it.
the
--
what
we're
asserting
here
is
that
textbooks
which
are
given
for
use
in
a
church
school
violate
the
constitution.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
in
this
case
--
i
would
argue
only
in
this
case.
the
issue
here
is
whether
a
textbook
should
be
given
to
parochial
schools.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
the
definition
--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
the
principle
could
be
i
think
narrowly
drawn
if
necessary
in
this
case
to
outlaw
textbooks
only.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
i
suggest
that
the
rule
that
the
text
--
that
giving
of
textbooks
for
use
in
church
schools
violates
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment
on
a
ground
that
it
constitutes
a
use
of
tax
funds
for
the
support
of
religion.
now,
that
is
the
rule
i'm
suggesting
that
this
court
adopt.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct.
i
have
reserved
ten
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
although
that's
not
involved
in
this
case,
i
would
say
that
if
it
were
given
for
use
in
connection
with
the
teaching
functions
in
the
school,
the
further
the
mission
of
the
school,
teaching
the
tenants
in
the
face
of
its
religion,
it
would
not
be
permitted.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
yes
your
honor
that
would
go
for
blackboard--
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
that's
correct
your
honor
to
church
schools.
mr.
marvin
e.
pollock
your
honor.
in
this
dissenting
opinion
in
everson,
justice
jackson
set
forth
the
cannonball
of
the
church
relating
to
catholic
schools
by
which
all
catholics
were
bound
so
far
as
i
know,
these
are
still
the
cannonball
of
the
church
relating
to
church
schools.
one
of
those
cannons
reads
as
follows.
catholic
children
are
to
be
educated
at
schools
where
not
only
nothing
contrary
to
catholic
faith
and
morals
is
thought
but
rather
in
schools
where
religious
and
world
training
occupy
the
first
place.
i
like
to
comment
too
on
something
that
mrs.
coon
said
having
to
do
with
the
pupil
request
under
the
statute
of
the
pupil
that
requested
the
books.
the
way
the
statute
is
first
written.
it
did
not
contain
the
definition
of
textbooks
and
requested
one
would
have
to
ask
is
what
role
can
a
12-year-old
play
the
selection
of
books
which
he's
going
to
use
it
in
school.
the
way
the
statute
read
then,
it
would
have
to
be
argued
that
the
student
could
go
to
the
school
board
and
ask
for
any
book
and
any
number
of
books
so
long
as
they
were
books
designated
for
use.
but
the
statute
was
amended
to
make
clear
that
the
only
book
as
student
could
request
is
one
which
is
legally
required
to
use
as
a
text
for
a
semester
more
in
a
school
he
legally
attends
making
it
absolutely
clear
that
it
is
this
school
that
is
ordering
the
books.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
say
briefly
that
there
are
many
advocates
of
aide
to
parochial
school
who
seek
to
further
purely
the
religious
objectives
by
masking
their
appeal
for
funds
in
the
rectory
for
public
purpose.
thus,
their
appeals
many
times
are
wrapped
in
the
mantle
of
the
educational
problem
or
poverty
problem.
while
no
one
would
dispute
the
need
for
these
programs,
we
must
be
careful
not
to
sacrifice
constitutional
principles
in
the
process.
the
principle
in
church
and
state
separate
has
served
this
nation
well
attesting
to
the
wisdom
of
those
who
fought
hardest
for
its
acceptance
in
our
constitution.
it
is
part
of
our
fabric
not
because
we
paid
the
lip
service
but
because
we
continue
to
give
it
vitality.
we
should
not
permit
the
principle
to
be
eroded
by
mouthing
its
words
while
stripping
it
of
all
significance.
i
submit
that
this
court
should
rule
that
the
furnishing
of
textbooks
by
the
state
of
new
york
with
funds
raised
by
taxation
constitutes
a
use
of
state
funds
to
a
religion
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
thank
you.
