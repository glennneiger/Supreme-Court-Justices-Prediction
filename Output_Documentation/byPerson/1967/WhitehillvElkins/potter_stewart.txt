justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
maybe
true
but
the
highest
judicial
--
not
that
the
--
the
highest
law
enforcement
officer
of
your
state
as
i
understand
it
has
said
that,
"yes,
that's
true
but
it's
not
for
you
or
for
us
to
read
the
statute".
and
it's
not
that
we
--
what
we
think
it
might
mean,
he
has
told
us
that
it
means
and
requires
no
more
than
this
oath
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
not
for
us
to
decide,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
a
matter
of
maryland
law.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
a
question
of
maryland
law,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
whether
he
has
authority
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
do
that.
that's
certainly
not
a
matter
of
federal
law.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
rosen,
you've
just
referred
to
this,
its
(inaudible)
on
the
bench,
as
an
oath.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
read
it,
it
technically
at
least
is
a
certification
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
rather
than
an
oath.
is
there
any
claim
in
this
case
that
the
petitioner
was
required
to
make
an
oath
contrary
to
his
religious
scruples
against
taking
an
oath
as
contrasted
with
an
affirmation?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
the
equivalent
of
an
affirmation,
i
see,
i
should
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
religious,
conscientious
scruples,
they
are
constitutional
or
they
--
or
you
think
this
violates
his
constitutional
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
rights
as
a
citizen.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
see
that
in
your
brief
and
that's
the
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
because
i
--
because
its
my
understanding
that
some
--
the
disciples
of
certain
religions
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
fine
but
it
violates
their
religious
teachings
to
take
any
kind
of
an
oath
even
though
on
the
witness
stand
to
tell
the
truth.
isn't
that
true,
they'd
rather
affirm
than
take
an
oath?
justice
potter
stewart
affirmation?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
hawes,
supposed
an
employee
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states,
but
he
was
a
completely
passive,
nominal
--
their
having
been
a
determination
that
the
communist
party
of
united
states,
is
an
organization
engaged
to
overthrow
by
force
or
violence.
but
he
safely
say,
“i
am
not
engaged
in
any
one
way
--
in
one
way
or
another
in
an
attempt
to
overthrow
and
so
forth
the
(inaudible)?”
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
giving
you
the
--
i'm
giving
you
the
basis.
the
hypothetical
is
he's
a
purely
nominal
passive
member
of
an
organization
which
is
engaged.
justice
potter
stewart
would
he
be
sure
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
he's
engaged
in
one
way
or
another
in
the
event.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
or
whether
or
not
the
reference
to
section
13
is
on
a
piece
of
paper
that
he
is
required
to
sign,
is
there
any
other
authority
in
maryland's
state
law
except
13
for
anybody
to
require
any
certification
like
this
one.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
the
statement
under
section
11
is
only
an
aid
of
the
termination
whether
that
he
was
a
subversive
person.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
we
--
only
further
along
under
11
on
the
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
that's
--
that
the
only
authority
for
the
statement
at
all
is
in
aid
of
a
determination
whether
he's
a
subversive
person,
is
that
right?
that's
the
only
authority
you
have
to
ask
any
certificate.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
might
not
be
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
ultimately
rather
than
your
state
attorney
general
to
decide
whether
or
not
this
certification
is
sufficient
in
compliance
with
the
maryland
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
never
been
before
the
court,
has
it,
the
maryland
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
your
attorney
general
has
advised
that
it
is
sufficient
in
compliance
but
as
to
what
you've
just
told
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
chief
justice
that
there's
no
way
binding
upon
the
maryland
court
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
a
separate
question.
justice
potter

the
question
that
i
thought

the

is
directed

in
any

require

my
