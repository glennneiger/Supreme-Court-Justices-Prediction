justice

but
suppose
this
oath
stood
alone.
suppose
the
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
--
if
we
would
go
along
with
respect
to
its
relationship
to
the
statute,
the
implications
in
that
relationship,
suppose
the
teachers
just
declined
to
take
this
particular
oath.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
all?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
it
also
got
the
phrase,
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
justice
abe
fortas
and
it
didn't
relate
to
overthrowing
the
government
in
any
other
way,
does
it?
justice
abe
fortas
by
force
or
violence.
justice
abe
fortas
but
of
course,
hasn't
been
so
read?
justice
abe
fortas
well
is
that
your
argument
that
the
oath
as
construed
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
it
means
something
more
than
it
seems
to
say?
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
believe
the
statute
out
as
it
--
would
you
perhaps
--
what
is
your
presentation
to
us?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
justice
abe
fortas
so
it
come
back
to
reliance
on
that
phrase
for
all
of
them
on
the
construction
of
the
act
on
the
shub
case.
justice
abe
fortas
i
wasn't
trying
to
insist
that;
i
was
trying
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
relied
on
your
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
say
that
if
you
required
a
teacher
to
swear
that
if
he
would
uphold
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
all
federal
employees
have
to
take
an
oath
to
have
effect?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
suggesting
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional
for
federal
employees
or
in
the
group
of
federal
employees?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
this
is
all
raised
in
the
present
tense
to
with
me.
i
am
not
indeed
--
he's
got
to
say
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
i'm
not
indeed
in
an
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force
and
violence.
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
this
is
quite
immaterial
direct
test
but
it's
rather
a
resilient
thing
to
require
a
grown
man
to
say
as
(inaudible).
but
that's
not
our
problem.
we
asked
him
to
say
whether
--
as
of
this
moment
of
time,
is
he
engaged
in
attempting
to
overthrow
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force
and
violence?
well,
that's
very
different
from
asking
are
you
engaged
or
have
you
engaged
or
do
you
intend
to
engage
in
subversive
activities.
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
also
have
said
that
he
is
being
required
to
say
that
he
is
--
won't
engage
in
a
subversive
activity
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that's
not
this
one.
justice
abe
fortas
but
all
of
that
is
modified,
there's
a
comma
and
it's
modified
by
the
phrase
by
the
course
of
violence.
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
you
can
--
the
idea
of
the
question
as
this
with
literary
product
if
it
overthrow
the
government
by
poison,
by
dum-dum
bullets,
by
machine
guns,
by
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
possession
of
whisky.
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
i
don't
see
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
see
that
those
are
before
us.are
you
arguing
that
they're
before
us
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
as
i
understand
the
argument
of
your
opponent,
perhaps
it
runs
this
way
that
this
statement
is
made
pursuant
to
section
13
of
the
subversiveness,
subversive
activities
act
of
1949,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
made
pursuant
to
that
section
of
the
law.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
well,
whoever
left
it
on,
its
there.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
--
there
you
are
in
section
13,
now
your
opponent
asks
--
so
says
that
the
--
if
mr.
whitehill
is
charged
with
knowledge
of
what's
in
section
13.
and
that
section
13
says
that
the
mr.
whitehill
and
many
state
employees
has
to
make
a
written
statement
which
shall
contain
notice
subject
to
the
penalties
of
perjury,
that
he
is
not
a
subversive
person
as
defined
in
this
article
and
then
it
goes
on
and
that
he
is
not
a
member
of
a
subversive
organization
or
a
foreign
subversive
organization
that
is
more
fully
defined
in
this
article.
now
i
suppose
if
the
argument
of
your
opponent
is
that
no
matter
what
this
statement
says
that
since
it's
made,
since
the
statement
is
made
pursuant
to
section
13
of
the
act
with
which
professor
whitehill
noticed
--
what
professor
whitehill
is
charged,
that
professor
whitehill
is
saying
that
he
is
not
a
subversive
person
as
defined
in
the
article
and
not
a
member
of
a
subversive
organization
or
a
foreign
subversive
organization
as
defined
in
the
act.
our
key
to
that
i
assume
on
your
--
attorney
general
has
(inaudible)
in
the
--
has
effectively
rewritten
section
13.
isn't
that
right
--
isn't
that
what
(inaudible)?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know,
but
i
don't
--
we
have
before
us
is
this
case.
that's
the
one
presumably
that
the
(inaudible).
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
does
have
the
reference
to
section
13.
justice
abe
