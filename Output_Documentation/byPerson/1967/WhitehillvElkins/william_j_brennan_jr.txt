would
it
be
any

do
you
ask

court
in
maryland
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
three
judge
court
of
maryland
has
found
this
enough
in
it,
hasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

you
mean,
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
they
accepted
the
oath
which
was
construed
by
the
attorney
general.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

containing
this
is
11
said.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
know
what
it
says
--
what's
this
mean,
in
securing
any
facts
necessary,
the
applicant
shall
be
required
to
sign
a
written
statement.
is
that
what
we're
talking
about?
containing
answers
to
such
inquiries
is
maybe
immaterial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
at
least
there's
no
statutory
requirement
that
the
broader
--
that
is
being
modified
here
by
the
attorney
general
because
the
form
was
not
specified
by
the
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
there
any
written
regulations
that
you
know
of,
of
any
department
in
the
state
of
maryland
with
respect
to
this
matter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
it's
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
struck
out
the
knowing
membership
provision.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you're
confident
that
he
could
sign
this
without
this
conformity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
take
it
that
the
advice
of
the
attorney
general
was
never
binding
in
any
agencies.
it's
only
a
guide,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
i
have
reference
that
apparently
it's
a
decision
of
your
court
of
appeals,
the
(inaudible)
case,
you're
familiar
with
i'm
sure
where
it
says
the
opinions
of
the
attorney
general
are
not
binding,
but
are
entitled
to
careful
consideration
of
service
guides
to
those
charge
of
the
administration
of

that
the
