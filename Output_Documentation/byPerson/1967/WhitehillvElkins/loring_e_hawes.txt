mr.
loring
e.
hawes
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
first
like
to
distinguish
this
interpretation
of
elfbrandt
that
was
presented
here
with
respect
to
the
legislative
gloss.
now
in
elfbrandt,
the
reason
that
legislative
gloss
became
important
was
that
the
perjury
portion
of
the
statute
incorporated
within
it
that
the
person
who
is
taking
the
oath
shall
not
knowingly
and
willfully
become
or
remain
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
etcetera.
this
is
not
the
case
in
the
maryland
certification
situation
because
the
maryland
perjury
statute
is
simply
a
criminal
statute
for
making
a
false
statement.
now,
the
words
“in
one
way
or
another,”
we
fail
to
see
how
these
words
could
possibly
give
anyone
any
trouble.
i
mean,
in
any
way.
its
mere
surplusage,
its
additional
language
was
neither
adds
to
nor
takes
away
from
the
words
or
meaning
of
the
oath
itself.
the
court
on
a
number
of
occasions
has
found
no
constitutional
difficulty
from
the
vagueness
standpoint
in
construing
the
words
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
these
words
have
been
used
in
federal
statutes
such
as
the
smith
act
and
the
vices
of
vagueness
which
has
been
found
in
other
oaths
and
other
laws
and
not
been
found
in
those
words.
the
oath
in
baggett
versus
bullitt
which
was
referable
to
a
washington
statute
which
is
identical
to
that
in
maryland
is
distinguishable
also.
in
that
case,
the
oath
said
that,
i
certify
that
i'm
not
a
subversive
person
as
defined
by
the
act
and
there
was
no
limitation
upon
the
definition
of
subversive
person
in
that
case,
in
the
oath
that
was
taken
in
the
state
of
washington.
and
so
the
case
of
baggett
versus
bullitt
does
not
constitute
a
precedent
for
overruling
gerende
or
making
the
maryland
oath
as
presently
stated
invalid.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
mr.
justice
white,
the
form
of
oath
is
not
prescribed
in
the
statute.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
i
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
i
believe
it
was.
i'm
not
certain
of
that.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
yes
there
is.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
well
11
contains
the
authorization
for
a
state
agency
to
make
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
-
rules
and
regulations
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
--
and
procedures.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
the
--
they
can
set
up
a
procedure
and
the
procedure
involved
here
as
i
see
it
would
be
a
written
statement
intending
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
containing
a
notice
that
it
is
subject
to
the
penalties
of
perjury.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
yes.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
that
would
be
true
under
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
well
he
did
in
this
case.
and
--
but
whether
he
did
in
the
initial
case,
i
can't
answer
it
right
now
because
i
don't
know.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
no,
he
would
have
the
authority
to
do
that
under
his
general
authority
as
attorney
general
to
--
as
a
legal
adviser
to
the
various
agencies
of
state
government.
and
this
would
be
a
function
of
his
rendering
legal
advice
to
write
or
create
a
--
an
oath
which
would
pass
the
constitutional
standards
and
would
also
conform
with
the
intent
of
the
act.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
that's
right,
yes
sir.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
with
respect
to
university
of
maryland,
it's
not
by
written
regulation.
it's
by
form
which
was
adopted
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
--
form
of
the
oath.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
i'd
--
possibly
in
baltimore
city,
the
school
board
has
affirmed.
this
isn't
part
of
this
case
--
it
is
not
in
the
record
and
i
couldn't
say
for
certain.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
no
sir.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
it
applies
to
all
employees
except
the
laborers.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
except
laborers.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
laborers.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
that's
right.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
i
would
think
it
would
be
--
the
question
there
as
to
whether
his
involvement
in
the
communist
party
was
more
than
just
as
you
stated.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
that
would
not
be
enough
under
this
court.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
i
think
so
because
this
court
said
so.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
well,
this
court
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
--
has
said
that
this
is
not
in
the
elfbrandt
case.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
we
struck
out
the
evidence
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
yes.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
with
that
clause
stricken,
yes.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
the
particular
oath
involved
in
this
case
does
say
that.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
yes.
no,
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
--
the
form
has
on
there
--
apparently
what
happened
was
that
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
--
when
it
went
to
the
printer,
the
printer
left
on
that
at
a
reference
to
section
13.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
in
this
particular
case,
yes.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
i
would
answer
that
question
in
two
ways.
one,
we
could
say
very
recently
that
section
13
has
been
rewritten
and
modified
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
yes
sir.
that
section
13
has
been
modified
by
the
oath
prescribed
by
the
attorney
general
which
was
presented
to
this
individual.
now,
this
gets
into
the
question
of
severability
and
so
forth
which
i
will
reach
later.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
but
secondly
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
yes.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
if
all
the
words
of
section
13
were
in
the
oath,
that
is
correct.
but,
secondly
i
would
say
this,
that
if
this
reference
to
section
13
becomes
a
basis
for
this
court's
decision
that
this
would
involve
only
this
one
individual
and
it
would
not
preclude
maryland's
requiring
him
to
execute
a
certification
which
did
not
have
a
reference
to
section
13
as
a
precondition
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
yes.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
that's
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
oh,
we
say
that
there's
authority
under
section
11
and
there's
one
under
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
under
15.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
yes,
it
is
in
the
appendix,
section
10a.
now,
in
section
15,
there
is
a
requirement
for
an
oath
of
candidates
for
office.
that's
not
the
question
--
the
oath
involved
here.
and
section
13
only
involves
those
persons
who
are
in
employment
on
june
1,
1949
and
that's
not
the
case
here
because
this
man
is
an
applicant
and
not
an
employee.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
that's
correct,
but
a
subversive
person
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
because,
first
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
that's
right,
for
an
applicant.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
no.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
at
that
time
it
was
brought
up
in
this
case.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
it
would
have
been
at
the
time
of
the
argument.
i
believe
it
was
february
last
year.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
the
question
of
the
authority
of
the
attorney
general
is
apparently
still
bothering
the
court.
and
i
should
once
again
try
to
establish
where
this
authority
comes
from
and
how
it
affects
this
interpretation
of
the
law
here.
now,
this
may
not
be
in
the
brief,
but
in
article
5,
section
3
of
the
maryland
constitution,
it
is
stated
that
the
attorney
general
shall
give
his
opinion
in
writing
on
any
legal
matter
or
subject.
and
in
code
article
32a
of
the
maryland
annotated
code
section
3,
the
attorney
general
shall
have
general
charge
supervision
and
direction
of
a
legal
business
of
the
other
state
and
shall
be
legal
adviser
and
representative
of
and
perform
all
legal
work
for
boards,
institutions,
departments,
etcetera
of
the
state.
now
the
university
of
maryland
of
course
is
a
department,
an
institution
or
an
agency
of
the
state.
the
applicable
part
of
section
11
of
the
overact
is
that
every
board
in
this
case
would
be
the
board
of
regents
or
other
agency
of
the
state
which
employs
--and
so
forth
employee
shall
establish
by
rules,
regulations
or
otherwise
procedures
designed
to
ascertain
before
any
person
is
appointed
or
employed
that
he
or
she
as
the
case
maybe
is
not
a
subversive
person
and
that
there
are
no
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
such
persons
are
subversive
persons.
now,
this
is
quite
similar
to
the
charge
in
section
15
which
was
construed
by
this
court
in
gerende
where
an
affidavit
was
required
for
a
person
who
is
a
candidate
for
election.
that
he
is
--
he
or
she
is
not
a
subversive
person
as
defined
in
this
article.
and
our
argument
here
is
that
if
the
oath
prescribed
here
which
was
the
one
that
this
court
said
was
sufficient
under
gerende
can
be
given
under
section
15
that
certainly
the
same
oath
should
be
able
to
be
given
under
section
11
of
the
act.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
well,
the
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
the
oath
here
is
not
prescribed
in
that
manner
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
the
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
no
sir.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
well,
in
the
letter
that
is
in
the
appendix
to
appellant's
brief
on
page
18a,
which
is
a
second
page
to
the
letter
from
attorney
general
finan
to
governor
tawes
dated
may
13,
1966.
in
that
letter,
the
attorney
general
suggested
--
and
this
is
giving
his
legal
advice
to
the
agency
--
to
all
of
state
agencies.
in
this
case,
to
the
governor,
to
the
secretary
of
state,
commissioner-personnel,
and
a
copy
of
course
went
to
the
university
of
maryland.
and
on
the
basis
of
this
letter,
it
is
up
to
the
state
agency
involved
to
prescribe
the
oath
and
to
give
it
to
its
employees.
now,
there
is
one
distinction
here
with
respect
to
commissioner-personnel
--
he
does
not
prescribe
the
personnel
procedures
for
the
university
of
maryland
because
of
the
autonomy
act
of
1952.
and
this
clause
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
as
to
the
body
of
the
oath,
it
did.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
except
--
they
made
it
apparently
an
error
in
having
it
printed
with
the
reference
to
section
13
which
shouldn't
have
been
in
there.
and
this
is
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
it
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
that
is
correct
because
only
a
court
can
bind
the
department
to
a
particular
interpretation
of
law.
however,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
department
do
follow
the
attorneys
general
--
attorney
general's
advice.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
this
is
not
in
the
record
and
i
have
no
personal
knowledge
of
this.
if
it's
true,
it's
something
that's
outside
of
the
record.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
well,
the
attorney
general
did
here.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
yes
sir.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
well,
the
oath
isn't
prescribed
in
that
form
by
law.
so
he
is
modifying
a
procedure
which
a
department
is
using
under
section
11
of
the
act.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
i
--
probably
commissioner-personnel
or
the
--
for
the
regions
in
the
case
of
the
university
of
maryland
on
the
advice
of
the
attorney
general.
they
actually
do
the
printing
of
--
at
the
university
with
respect
to
their
oaths.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
yes,
they
did.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
oh,
in
other
words
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
well,
the
--
let's
look
at
this
way.
the
--
we're
talking
about
two
o's
here.
first,
the
one
prior
to
1966
which
is
in
identical
words
of
what
this
court
said
in
gerende,
the
attorney
general
could
advise
the
state
agencies
as
conforming
with
i
guess
the
maryland
law
and
satisfying
its
requirements
completely.
now,
what
the
attorney
general
has
done
here
is
to
limit
that
further.
now
if
the
department
had
not
taken
his
advice
and
used
the
old
pledge,
we
might
be
up
here
on
a
different
case.
but
in
this
case,
he
did
not,
the
department
--
of
the
board
of
regents
took
the
attorney
general's
advice
and
use
this
to
take
the
form.
now
with
respect
to
the
negative
nature
of
the
oath
which
was
brought
up,
we
would
say
this
is
--
in
the
very
fact
that
you
could
have
an
oath,
this
doesn't
differ
too
much
from
the
certifications
that
the
facts
are
true
and
correct
and
so
forth
that
one
makes
on
your
income
tax
forms,
employment
applications,
auto
registration,
auto
licenses
and
so
forth.
and
on
those
--
on
certain
types
of
applications,
an
applicant
maybe
asked
whether
he
is
taking
narcotics
or
his
--
a
consumer
of
a
certain
amount
of
alcohol
or
certain
other
very
personnel
type
of
questions
which
don't
reach
first
amendment
freedoms,
beliefs
or
speech
and
so
forth
but
nevertheless
or
in
the
same
type
of
form
that
this
particular
certification
is.
now,
with
respect
to
the
--
the
extent
of
the
oath
in
reaching
the
innocent
person
who
is
a
mere
member
of
an
organization
or
something
of
this
sort,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
oath
itself
--
the
title
to
the
other
law
itself
--
the
act
itself
states
that
this
is
an
act
to
add
a
new
article
making
it
a
crime
to
commit
acts
or
advocate
acts
intended
to
affect
the
overthrow
of
the
government
and
so
forth
by
an
--
violence
and
so
forth
or
to
attempt
or
conspire
to
do
so.
now,
this
title
and
the
act
itself
which
construed
by
the
maryland
court
as
set
forth
in
our
brief,
as
its
intention
is
to
prevent
infiltration
into
our
state,
county
and
municipal
governments
of
person
who
are
engaged
in
one
way
or
another
in
the
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
and
this
interpretation
of
the
intent
of
the
act
was
taken
in
by
this
court
in
gerende
to
be
the
full
meaning
of
it.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
a
certification
in
this
language
therefore
is
sufficient
under
all
the
cases
involving
loyalty
oaths
to
this
time.
and
that
this
court
would
have
to
overrule
gerende
and
possibly
garner
or
cramp
and
at
least
distinguish
these
cases
if
it
were
to
make
an
adverse
ruling
with
respect
to
this
oath
on
the
grounds
of
vagueness.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
yes.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
yes,
it
passed
upon
a
form
which
was
larger
than
this
one.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
eliminating
the
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
--
words
in
1966.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
that
is
correct.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
it
is
not
bound
to
follow
it
but
it
would
certain
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
no,
because
the
portion
of
the
oath
which
is
now
being
used
was
approved
by
the
court.
there
were
just
some
additional
words
which
were
thrown
out
in
1966,
which
may
or
may
not
be
valid
or
invalid
that
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
the
maryland
court?
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
if
they
were
still
being
used.
but
if
it
isn't
being
used,
it
doesn't
seem
to
make
any
difference.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
well,
if
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
that's
correct,
it
has
not.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
that's
right.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
what
the
--
this
court
can
be
assured
that
the
maryland
court
will
find
the
law
to
be
constitutional.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
(inaudible)
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
yes.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
that's
correct.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
first
like
to
distinguish
this
interpretation
of
elfbrandt
that
was
presented
here
with
respect
to
the
legislative
gloss.
now
in
elfbrandt,
the
reason
that
legislative
gloss
became
important
was
that
the
perjury
portion
of
the
statute
incorporated
within
it
that
the
person
who
is
taking
the
oath
shall
not
knowingly
and
willfully
become
or
remain
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
etcetera.
this
is
not
the
case
in
the
maryland
certification
situation
because
the
maryland
perjury
statute
is
simply
a
criminal
statute
for
making
a
false
statement.
now,
the
words
“in
one
way
or
another,”
we
fail
to
see
how
these
words
could
possibly
give
anyone
any
trouble.
i
mean,
in
any
way.
its
mere
surplusage,
its
additional
language
was
neither
adds
to
nor
takes
away
from
the
words
or
meaning
of
the
oath
itself.
the
court
on
a
number
of
occasions
has
found
no
constitutional
difficulty
from
the
vagueness
standpoint
in
construing
the
words
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
these
words
have
been
used
in
federal
statutes
such
as
the
smith
act
and
the
vices
of
vagueness
which
has
been
found
in
other
oaths
and
other
laws
and
not
been
found
in
those
words.
the
oath
in
baggett
versus
bullitt
which
was
referable
to
a
washington
statute
which
is
identical
to
that
in
maryland
is
distinguishable
also.
in
that
case,
the
oath
said
that,
i
certify
that
i'm
not
a
subversive
person
as
defined
by
the
act
and
there
was
no
limitation
upon
the
definition
of
subversive
person
in
that
case,
in
the
oath
that
was
taken
in
the
state
of
washington.
and
so
the
case
of
baggett
versus
bullitt
does
not
constitute
a
precedent
for
overruling
gerende
or
making
the
maryland
oath
as
presently
stated
invalid.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
mr.
justice
white,
the
form
of
oath
is
not
prescribed
in
the
statute.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
i
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
i
believe
it
was.
i'm
not
certain
of
that.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
yes
there
is.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
well
11
contains
the
authorization
for
a
state
agency
to
make
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
-
rules
and
regulations
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
--
and
procedures.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
the
--
they
can
set
up
a
procedure
and
the
procedure
involved
here
as
i
see
it
would
be
a
written
statement
intending
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
containing
a
notice
that
it
is
subject
to
the
penalties
of
perjury.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
yes.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
that
would
be
true
under
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
well
he
did
in
this
case.
and
--
but
whether
he
did
in
the
initial
case,
i
can't
answer
it
right
now
because
i
don't
know.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
no,
he
would
have
the
authority
to
do
that
under
his
general
authority
as
attorney
general
to
--
as
a
legal
adviser
to
the
various
agencies
of
state
government.
and
this
would
be
a
function
of
his
rendering
legal
advice
to
write
or
create
a
--
an
oath
which
would
pass
the
constitutional
standards
and
would
also
conform
with
the
intent
of
the
act.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
that's
right,
yes
sir.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
with
respect
to
university
of
maryland,
it's
not
by
written
regulation.
it's
by
form
which
was
adopted
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
--
form
of
the
oath.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
i'd
--
possibly
in
baltimore
city,
the
school
board
has
affirmed.
this
isn't
part
of
this
case
--
it
is
not
in
the
record
and
i
couldn't
say
for
certain.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
no
sir.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
it
applies
to
all
employees
except
the
laborers.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
except
laborers.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
laborers.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
that's
right.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
i
would
think
it
would
be
--
the
question
there
as
to
whether
his
involvement
in
the
communist
party
was
more
than
just
as
you
stated.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
that
would
not
be
enough
under
this
court.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
i
think
so
because
this
court
said
so.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
well,
this
court
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
--
has
said
that
this
is
not
in
the
elfbrandt
case.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
we
struck
out
the
evidence
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
yes.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
with
that
clause
stricken,
yes.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
the
particular
oath
involved
in
this
case
does
say
that.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
yes.
no,
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
--
the
form
has
on
there
--
apparently
what
happened
was
that
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
--
when
it
went
to
the
printer,
the
printer
left
on
that
at
a
reference
to
section
13.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
in
this
particular
case,
yes.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
i
would
answer
that
question
in
two
ways.
one,
we
could
say
very
recently
that
section
13
has
been
rewritten
and
modified
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
yes
sir.
that
section
13
has
been
modified
by
the
oath
prescribed
by
the
attorney
general
which
was
presented
to
this
individual.
now,
this
gets
into
the
question
of
severability
and
so
forth
which
i
will
reach
later.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
but
secondly
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
yes.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
if
all
the
words
of
section
13
were
in
the
oath,
that
is
correct.
but,
secondly
i
would
say
this,
that
if
this
reference
to
section
13
becomes
a
basis
for
this
court's
decision
that
this
would
involve
only
this
one
individual
and
it
would
not
preclude
maryland's
requiring
him
to
execute
a
certification
which
did
not
have
a
reference
to
section
13
as
a
precondition
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
yes.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
that's
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
oh,
we
say
that
there's
authority
under
section
11
and
there's
one
under
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
under
15.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
yes,
it
is
in
the
appendix,
section
10a.
now,
in
section
15,
there
is
a
requirement
for
an
oath
of
candidates
for
office.
that's
not
the
question
--
the
oath
involved
here.
and
section
13
only
involves
those
persons
who
are
in
employment
on
june
1,
1949
and
that's
not
the
case
here
because
this
man
is
an
applicant
and
not
an
employee.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
that's
correct,
but
a
subversive
person
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
because,
first
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
that's
right,
for
an
applicant.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
no.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
at
that
time
it
was
brought
up
in
this
case.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
it
would
have
been
at
the
time
of
the
argument.
i
believe
it
was
february
last
year.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
the
question
of
the
authority
of
the
attorney
general
is
apparently
still
bothering
the
court.
and
i
should
once
again
try
to
establish
where
this
authority
comes
from
and
how
it
affects
this
interpretation
of
the
law
here.
now,
this
may
not
be
in
the
brief,
but
in
article
5,
section
3
of
the
maryland
constitution,
it
is
stated
that
the
attorney
general
shall
give
his
opinion
in
writing
on
any
legal
matter
or
subject.
and
in
code
article
32a
of
the
maryland
annotated
code
section
3,
the
attorney
general
shall
have
general
charge
supervision
and
direction
of
a
legal
business
of
the
other
state
and
shall
be
legal
adviser
and
representative
of
and
perform
all
legal
work
for
boards,
institutions,
departments,
etcetera
of
the
state.
now
the
university
of
maryland
of
course
is
a
department,
an
institution
or
an
agency
of
the
state.
the
applicable
part
of
section
11
of
the
overact
is
that
every
board
in
this
case
would
be
the
board
of
regents
or
other
agency
of
the
state
which
employs
--and
so
forth
employee
shall
establish
by
rules,
regulations
or
otherwise
procedures
designed
to
ascertain
before
any
person
is
appointed
or
employed
that
he
or
she
as
the
case
maybe
is
not
a
subversive
person
and
that
there
are
no
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
such
persons
are
subversive
persons.
now,
this
is
quite
similar
to
the
charge
in
section
15
which
was
construed
by
this
court
in
gerende
where
an
affidavit
was
required
for
a
person
who
is
a
candidate
for
election.
that
he
is
--
he
or
she
is
not
a
subversive
person
as
defined
in
this
article.
and
our
argument
here
is
that
if
the
oath
prescribed
here
which
was
the
one
that
this
court
said
was
sufficient
under
gerende
can
be
given
under
section
15
that
certainly
the
same
oath
should
be
able
to
be
given
under
section
11
of
the
act.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
well,
the
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
the
oath
here
is
not
prescribed
in
that
manner
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
the
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
no
sir.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
well,
in
the
letter
that
is
in
the
appendix
to
appellant's
brief
on
page
18a,
which
is
a
second
page
to
the
letter
from
attorney
general
finan
to
governor
tawes
dated
may
13,
1966.
in
that
letter,
the
attorney
general
suggested
--
and
this
is
giving
his
legal
advice
to
the
agency
--
to
all
of
state
agencies.
in
this
case,
to
the
governor,
to
the
secretary
of
state,
commissioner-personnel,
and
a
copy
of
course
went
to
the
university
of
maryland.
and
on
the
basis
of
this
letter,
it
is
up
to
the
state
agency
involved
to
prescribe
the
oath
and
to
give
it
to
its
employees.
now,
there
is
one
distinction
here
with
respect
to
commissioner-personnel
--
he
does
not
prescribe
the
personnel
procedures
for
the
university
of
maryland
because
of
the
autonomy
act
of
1952.
and
this
clause
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
as
to
the
body
of
the
oath,
it
did.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
except
--
they
made
it
apparently
an
error
in
having
it
printed
with
the
reference
to
section
13
which
shouldn't
have
been
in
there.
and
this
is
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
it
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
that
is
correct
because
only
a
court
can
bind
the
department
to
a
particular
interpretation
of
law.
however,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
department
do
follow
the
attorneys
general
--
attorney
general's
advice.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
this
is
not
in
the
record
and
i
have
no
personal
knowledge
of
this.
if
it's
true,
it's
something
that's
outside
of
the
record.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
well,
the
attorney
general
did
here.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
yes
sir.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
well,
the
oath
isn't
prescribed
in
that
form
by
law.
so
he
is
modifying
a
procedure
which
a
department
is
using
under
section
11
of
the
act.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
i
--
probably
commissioner-personnel
or
the
--
for
the
regions
in
the
case
of
the
university
of
maryland
on
the
advice
of
the
attorney
general.
they
actually
do
the
printing
of
--
at
the
university
with
respect
to
their
oaths.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
yes,
they
did.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
oh,
in
other
words
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
well,
the
--
let's
look
at
this
way.
the
--
we're
talking
about
two
o's
here.
first,
the
one
prior
to
1966
which
is
in
identical
words
of
what
this
court
said
in
gerende,
the
attorney
general
could
advise
the
state
agencies
as
conforming
with
i
guess
the
maryland
law
and
satisfying
its
requirements
completely.
now,
what
the
attorney
general
has
done
here
is
to
limit
that
further.
now
if
the
department
had
not
taken
his
advice
and
used
the
old
pledge,
we
might
be
up
here
on
a
different
case.
but
in
this
case,
he
did
not,
the
department
--
of
the
board
of
regents
took
the
attorney
general's
advice
and
use
this
to
take
the
form.
now
with
respect
to
the
negative
nature
of
the
oath
which
was
brought
up,
we
would
say
this
is
--
in
the
very
fact
that
you
could
have
an
oath,
this
doesn't
differ
too
much
from
the
certifications
that
the
facts
are
true
and
correct
and
so
forth
that
one
makes
on
your
income
tax
forms,
employment
applications,
auto
registration,
auto
licenses
and
so
forth.
and
on
those
--
on
certain
types
of
applications,
an
applicant
maybe
asked
whether
he
is
taking
narcotics
or
his
--
a
consumer
of
a
certain
amount
of
alcohol
or
certain
other
very
personnel
type
of
questions
which
don't
reach
first
amendment
freedoms,
beliefs
or
speech
and
so
forth
but
nevertheless
or
in
the
same
type
of
form
that
this
particular
certification
is.
now,
with
respect
to
the
--
the
extent
of
the
oath
in
reaching
the
innocent
person
who
is
a
mere
member
of
an
organization
or
something
of
this
sort,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
oath
itself
--
the
title
to
the
other
law
itself
--
the
act
itself
states
that
this
is
an
act
to
add
a
new
article
making
it
a
crime
to
commit
acts
or
advocate
acts
intended
to
affect
the
overthrow
of
the
government
and
so
forth
by
an
--
violence
and
so
forth
or
to
attempt
or
conspire
to
do
so.
now,
this
title
and
the
act
itself
which
construed
by
the
maryland
court
as
set
forth
in
our
brief,
as
its
intention
is
to
prevent
infiltration
into
our
state,
county
and
municipal
governments
of
person
who
are
engaged
in
one
way
or
another
in
the
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
and
this
interpretation
of
the
intent
of
the
act
was
taken
in
by
this
court
in
gerende
to
be
the
full
meaning
of
it.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
a
certification
in
this
language
therefore
is
sufficient
under
all
the
cases
involving
loyalty
oaths
to
this
time.
and
that
this
court
would
have
to
overrule
gerende
and
possibly
garner
or
cramp
and
at
least
distinguish
these
cases
if
it
were
to
make
an
adverse
ruling
with
respect
to
this
oath
on
the
grounds
of
vagueness.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
yes.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
yes,
it
passed
upon
a
form
which
was
larger
than
this
one.
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
eliminating
the
--
mr.
loring
e.
hawes
--
words
in
1966.
mr.
loring
e.
