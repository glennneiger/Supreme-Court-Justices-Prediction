mr.
sanford

--
from
the
statute,
the
definitional
provisions
of
which
were
identical
to
those
voided
in
the
baggett
and
dombrowski
cases
are
unconstitutionally
fraud,
vague
and
indefinite.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
comparatively
simple.
it's
a
direct
appeal
from
a
final
order
and
judgment
of
a
statutory
three-judge
court
sitting
in
maryland,
dismissing
the
appellant's
complaint
on
the
grounds
of
a
prior
precedent
to
this
court.
the
appellant,
a
quaker,
is
an
author
of
works
of
fiction
and
nonfiction,
and
a
teacher
of
creative
writing
at
the
johns
hopkins
university.
he
was
invited
in
the
summer
of
1966
to
teach
creative
writing
at
the
university
of
maryland
for
the
academic
year
of
1966-1967.
he
was
to
be
paid
$7,000
over
10
months.
in
july,
he
received
by
mail
a
copy
of
the
contract
to
be
signed
and
certain
other
documents
including
the
certification
of
applicant
for
public
employment
which
if
i
may
i'd
like
to
read
to
the
court.
it's
captioned
required
by
law,
article
85a,
paragraph
13
annotated
code
of
maryland
1957.
it
appears
by
the
way
in
the
transcript
at
page
11
in
the
appendix
of
the
appellant's
brief
at
page
16a.
it
states,
“i,
--
leaving
space
for
the
name
--,
do
hereby
certify
that
i
am
not
engaged
in
one
way
or
another
in
an
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states,
or
the
state
of
maryland,
or
any
political
subdivision
of
either
of
them,
by
force
or
violence.
i
further
certify
that
i
understand
the
aforegoing
statement
is
made
subject
to
the
penalties
of
perjury
prescribed
in
article
27,
section
439
of
the
annotated
code
of
maryland,”
--
and
there's
a
space
for
the
date
and
the
signature.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
the
appellant
signed
the
contract,
executed
the
other
papers
with
the
exception
of
the
loyalty
of.
he
returned
these
documents
and
advised
his
correspondent
in
a
separate
letter
that
on
conscientious
grounds
he
would
not
sign
the
required
oath.
he
offered
to
teach
by
the
way
without
compensation
pending
adjudication
of
the
constitutional
issues.
he
received
a
reply
informing
him
that
the
university
could
not
accept
his
services
until
he
had
executed
and
filed
the
oath.
on
august
19,
1966,
he
filed
a
class
action.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
more
or
less
specific?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
would
say
in
the
context
to
the
statute
which
is
the
only
way
that
the
oath
can
be
read,
it's
much
less
specific.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
it's
the
appellant's
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
at
this
time,
yes
justice
harlan.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
however,
he
has
to
take
this
oath
as
authorized
under
a
specific
statute
and
it's
our
contention
that
the
gerende
case,
if
that's
what
you're
referring
to
justice
harlan,
does
not
really
hold
for
the
proposition
that
the
oath
can
be
read
without
the
statute.
and
if
it
does,
the
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court
will
make
it
quite
clear
that
an
oath
cannot
be
considered
outside
of
the
context
of
its
statute.
and
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
we
believe
that
that's
what
the
elfbrandt
case
indicates.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
the
oath
itself
is
quite
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
it
has
two
references.
it
has
a
caption
and
it
also
provides
that
it's
subject
to
the
penalties
of
perjury
and
the
only
way
in
which
this
could
be
subject
to
the
penalties
of
perjuries
on
a
statutory
basis
which
is
also
a
reference
to
the
statute
ultimately.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes,
but
this
would
be
statutory
perjury
and
the
only
statute
it
provides
for
the
oath
happens
to
be
the
overact
itself.
in
addition,
the
phrase
in
one
way
or
another
we
contend
is
unduly
broad
and
vague.
but
your
honor
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
if
it
stood
alone
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
and
that's
all
the
statute
said
justice
fortas.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well
this
particular
oath
to
me
would
still
suggest
is
unduly
vague
to
the
extent
that
it
has
the
phrase
in
one
way
or
another
in
it
which
defies
the
definition
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
certainly.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
but
it
says
in
one
way
or
another.
that
could
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
by
force
or
violence.
that
could
be
read
to
mean
the
“in
one
way
or
another”
phrase
that
mere
adherence
to
an
organization
that's
engaged
in
an
attempt
or
about
to
be
engaged
in
an
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
it
--
it's
not
clear.
the
only
judicial
determination
of
the
statute
and
oath
other
than
the
gerende
case
is
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland's
decision
in
the
shub
case
in
1950.
and
while
--
one
could
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
attempted
to
narrow
the
construction
of
the
actual
statute,
it
certainly
isn't
clear
and
it's
our
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
reading
of
the
statute
would
contemplate
mere
advocacy
of
abstract
ideas
within
the
ambit
of
the
statute
and
therefore
the
oath.
and
also
mere
membership,
mere
knowing
membership
in
an
organization,
not
even
necessarily
qualified
to
active
membership
and
certainly
not
qualified
to
membership
with
specific
intent
to
support
the
goals,
the
unlawful
goals
of
the
organization.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
our
argument
is
that
the
oath
as
read
with
the
statute
as
construed
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
clearly
contemplates
that
which
this
court
declared
unconstitutionally
broad
and
vague
in
keyishian
and
elfbrandt
and
baggett.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
if
the
statute
is
just
left
out
entirely,
well
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--
we
have
great
deal
of
difficulty
leaving
the
statute
out.
there's
no
other
authority
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--
in
the
oath.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
but
leaving
the
statute
out,
it's
our
position
that
the
phrase
“in
one
way
or
another"
which
is
a
phrase
admitted
--
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
and
by
this
court
in
the
gerende
case
has
no
definite
meaning.
and
if
it
does
have
a
definite
meaning,
it's
too
broad.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
if
you
insist
justice
fortas
that
we
have
to
leave
the
statute
out,
i
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
do
rely
upon
that
phrase
but
we
also
make
an
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
we
also
make
another
substantive
argument
with
respect
to
the
oath
if
it's
read
by
itself
and
that
is
we
believe
that
these
negative
disclaimers
by
themselves,
by
their
very
nature,
violations
of
the
first
amendment
that
--
just
is
across
the
board
requirement
that
one
say,
“i
am
not
disloyal”,
whatever
that
means.
but
that's
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
in
addition,
we
suggest
as
the
brief
amicus
curiae
of
the
aaup
did
that
this
kind
of
an
oath,
not
giving
anybody
an
opportunity
to
explain
or
get
clarification
of
the
oath
or
explain
his
reasons
for
not
stating
he
is
not
disloyal
that
by
not
giving
any
opportunity
for
a
hearing
or
an
explanation
that
the
oath
violates
procedural
due
process
in
the
first
amendment
context.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that's
a
harder
case
justice
fortas
of
course.
i
think
we
might
be
willing
to
argue
that
there's
no
warrant
for
an
across
the
board
declaration
by
all
persons
but
i
think
we
might
fall
back
to
an
intermediate
position
and
suggest
that
if
teachers
were
singled
out
as
the
only
group
to
swear,
only
group
among
public
employees
that
that
would
raise
people
protection
problems
for
us
if
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
right.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no.
in
this
case,
we
don't
think
we
have
to
reach
the
question
whether
an
affirmative
declaration
of
allegiance
is
unconstitutional.
we
certainly
see
that
there's
a
basis
in
the
text
of
the
constitution
itself
for
this
kind
of
a
declaration.
so
i
can't
answer
that
question
so
far
as
my
client
is
concerned.
definitively,
we're
faced
with
a
negative
disclaimer
and
it's
not
an
affirmative
declaration.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
we'd
have
a
lot
more
trouble,
i
must
admit
with
that
affirming
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
we
do
go
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
a
loyalty
oath
that
requires
a
negative
disclaimer,
i
am
not
disloyal,
i
am
not
a
subversive
person,
i
am
not
engaged
in,
that
this
carries
such
encored
connotations
that
it
is
itself
an
undue
burden
on
the
first
amendment.
so
far
as
an
affirmative
statement
of
allegiance
is
concerned,
we
don't
go
so
far
in
this
case
as
to
argue
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
we'd
like
to
see
that
case
before
we
had
to
address
ourselves
to
the
particular
issue
of
course.
if
i
may
proceed
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
it
could
be
taken
to
mean
other
than
by
force
or
violence
and
certainly
even
if
read
to
be
modified
by
force
or
violence,
it
could
be
taken
to
mean
adherence
to
an
organization
engaged
or
about
to
be
engaged
and
overthrow
without
any
specific
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that's
right.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
that's
not
quite
accurate
justice
harlan.
maryland
didn't
do
that
and
attorney
general
of
maryland
made
a
recommendation.
just
as
an
attorney
general
in
gerende
stated
that
he
would
advise
various
officials
in
the
state
to
give
the
oath
that
was
approved
or
apparently
approved
in
gerende.
as
a
matter
of
fact
justice
harlan,
that
oath
was
never
consistently
given,
there
are
subdivisions
in
this
--
in
the
state
of
maryland
they're
still
giving
the
oath
in
terms
of
the
definitional
phrase
in
section
1
of
the
act.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
right.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that's
right.
so
far
as
the
oath
that
mr.
whitehill
was
requested
or
required
to
sign,
it
did
not
include
the
membership
provision.
i
will
argue
further
along
that
the
attorney
general
probably
has
no
authority
or
not
adequate
authority,
or
power
to
rewrite
the
oath
and
you
certainly
has
adequate
authority
or
power
to
rewrite
the
statute
which
was
judicially
construed
albeit
not
as
clearly
as
we
would
like
in
the
shub
case.
basically,
appellant
agrees
that
the
first
issue
before
the
court
is
the
current
status
of
the
gerende
decision.
however,
before
addressing
or
readdressing
myself
as
the
case
maybe
to
gerende,
it
might
be
appropriate
for
me
to
just
outline
briefly
the
four
substantive
or
meritorious
grounds
on
which
appellant
contends
that
the
oath
and
the
statute
are
unconstitutional.
first,
i
suggest
that
it's
our
position
that
the
oath
and
the
statute
were
unconstitutionally
broad,
vague
and
uncertain
in
degradation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause.
second,
we
contend
that
this
indiscriminate
loyalty
of
or
non-disloyalty
disclaimer,
otherwise
unconstitutionally
infringes
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
freedoms
of
belief,
association
and
academic
freedom.
third,
in
violation
of
procedural
due
process,
the
oath
and
the
statute
further
infringe
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
interests
by
denying
public
employment
without
affording
any
hearing
on
questions
of
loyalty
or
subversiveness
and
by
shifting
burdens
of
proof
with
respect
to
these
questions
to
the
applicant.
and
fourth,
together
the
statute
and
the
oath
constitute
an
unlawful
bill
of
attainder.
now
this
court's
decision
in
gerende,
the
1951
very
brief
per
curiam
decision
in
gerende
involved
section
15
of
the
act,
so-called
candidate's
oath.
in
gerende,
the
court
relied
upon
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland's
construction
of
that
provision
in
shub
versus
simpson.
perhaps
if
i
could
refresh
your
honor's
memories
with
respect
to
gerende,
in
that
case
you
said,
“the
scope
of
the
state
law
was
passed
on
--
in
shub".
we
read
this
decision
to
hold
that
to
obtain
a
place
on
a
maryland
ballot
for
candidate
need
only
make
oath
that
he
is
not
a
person
who
is
engaged
"in
one
way
or
another
in
the
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violation,”
and
that
he
is
not
knowingly
a
member
of
an
organization
engaged
in
such
an
attempt.
at
the
bar
of
this
court,
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
maryland
declared
that
he
would
advise
the
proper
authorities
to
and
accept
an
affidavit
in
these
terms
to
satisfying
in
full
the
statutory
requirement.
under
these
circumstances
and
with
this
understanding,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
now
appellees
insist
that
the
decision
in
gerende
in
effect
severs
the
certification
or
oath
from
the
statute
and
insulates
it,
claimed
innocuous
on
its
face
as
we've
just
discussed
from
constitutional
attack.
appellant
respectfully
disagrees.
first,
the
certification
is
not
innocuous
on
its
phase.
both
the
supreme
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
professor
whitehill
is
still
teaching
at
the
johns
hopkins
university,
he
recently
published
a
novel
as
a
matter
of
fact.
but
he
lives
in
maryland.
he
was
ready,
willing
and
able
to
fulfill
the
contract
at
any
time
during
his
term.
he
is
currently
a
lecturer
in
english,
teaching
creative
writing
at
johns
hopkins.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
the
university
of
maryland,
the
college
of
art.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
for
the
academic
year
1966-1967,
an
academic
year
which
would
have
ended
in
june
of
1967th.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
no
more
than
there
was
in
bond
versus
floyd
last
term.
professor
whitehill
would
have
claimed
on
back
wages
at
very
least.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
$7,000.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well
this
would
have
been
an
addition
to
his
job
at
hopkins.
there
is
no
real
question
of
mitigation.
this
was
a
one-day
or
two-day
a
week
operation
and
it's
not
the
sort
of
thing
that
a
man
could
go
out
and
mitigate.
he
was
filling
in
for
a
specific
post,
you
don't
have
too
many
instructors
of
creative
writing
around
nor
do
you
in
--
in
a
given
state
have
too
many
opportunities
to
teach
creative
writing.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
the
question
of
mootness
has
not
been
raised
and
as
i
suggested,
the
bond
case
indicates
that
it
would
not
appropriately
be
raised
and
there's
johnson
versus
branch,
the
fourth
circuit
decision
dealing
with
dismissal
of
certain
school
teachers.
it
indicate
that
the
damages
themselves
would
be
adequate
--
of
course
further
there
--
this
is
a
continuing
situation
maybe
not
directly
with
respect
to
professor
whitehill.
but
we
have
a
file
of
additional
people
and
could
be
--
we
could
come
in
to
court
tomorrow
and
file
a
new
suit
in
the
district
of
maryland
and
if
need
to
be
there,
or
continually
cases
coming
up
in
maryland
at
this
time.
now
as
we
suggested,
the
certification
is
not
innocuous
on
its
face.
first,
the
supreme
court
and
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
authorized
a
prohibition
of
knowing
membership
in
an
organization
engaged
in
an
attempt
to
violently
overthrow
the
government
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well
if
you
struck
in
one
way
or
another
justice
marshall,
i
supposed
that
the
oath
would
become
comparatively
unvague.
however,
we
would
still
rely
upon
our
two
or
three
other
arguments
that
first
this
kind
of
a
negative
oath,
a
negative
disclaimer
itself
violates
the
first
amendment.
it's
taken
up
on
point
too
in
our
brief
in
effect.
and
second,
that
by
not
affording
any
procedural
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that
might
be
what
we've
been
forced
to
ask
justice
marshall.
we
--
we're
not
saying
that
you
can't
in
all
circumstances
certainly
ask
somebody
whether
he
will
adhere
to
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
the
implications
of
asking
the
negative
as
dr.
glass
--
eventually
glass
suggested,
it's
like
asking
a
man
whether
he's
being
unfaithful.
the
implication
carries
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
did
i
mind
taking
the
oath
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--
when
i
became
a
member
of
the
bar?
it
was
an
affirmative
oath
as
i
recall.
i
might
say,
i
didn't
mind
taking
the
oath
for
my
employment
with
the
university
of
maryland.
i
found
that
it
exceedingly
offensive.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no,
i
did
not
mind
taking
the
oath
which
as
i
recall,
in
connecticut
it
was
an
oath
or
affirmation
to
support
the
laws
and
constitution.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that's
true.
and
of
course,
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
konigsberg
and
staff
locations
indicated
that
this
kind
of
inquiry
might
be
appropriate.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well
we
have
suggest
--
we
have
suggested
in
our
oath
that
--
i
mean,
in
our
brief
that
the
--
that
particularly
with
respect
to
the
question
of
subversiveness
which
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that's
a
different
area.
it
doesn't
involve
the
first
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
supposed
one
can
be
asked
that
it's
germane
to
whether
or
not
you're
--
you
should
be
admitted
to
practice.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
it's
just
a
negative
oath,
justice
white.
it's
not
in
the
first
amendment
area.
what's
you're
asking
mr.
whitehill
is
to
say
is
i
am
not
subversive.
that
is,
i
do
not
hold
or
act
upon
certain
political
ideals
which
is
purely
first
amendment
matter.
if
you
ask
a
man
who
is
to
be
admitted
to
the
practice
of
law,
have
you
ever
been
convicted
of
a
felony?
that
doesn't
to
me
raise
very
many
first
amendment
implications.
we're
in
the
area
of
the
first
amendment
and
this
as
the
court
will
notice
is
a
very
special
area
and
distinguishable
at
least
on
that
basis.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well
that
raises
precisely
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--
one
of
the
grounds
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that's
right.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well
that's
what
the
oath
says
and
i
agree
with
justice
fortas,
it
is
rather
silly.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
we
say
of
course
that
the
phrase
“in
one
way
or
another”
means
subversive
activities
of
course
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
the
court
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
of
course
we
don't
read
that
phrase
as
you
do.
at
this
moment
justice
fortas,
further,
we
suggest
that
the
very
narrowness
of
the
oath
if
that's
the
way
you
read
it
which
speaks
and
as
you
suggested
foolishly
of,
“are
you
at
present,
this
moment,
this
instant
in
history,
engaged
in
an
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government?"
the
very
narrowness
of
that
inquiry
only
highlights
section
14
of
the
statute
and
section
10
of
the
statute.
section
10
says
that
no
subversive
person
shall
be
employed
by
the
state.
section
14
provides
for
continual
surveillance
of
persons
in
the
employee
of
the
state,
including
teachers,
including
mr.
whitehill
had
he
been
employed
by
the
state.
continual
surveillance
of
these
people
to
determine
whether
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--
in
the
future
they
become
subversive
persons.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes
we
are.
we
are
arguing
--
our
basic
argument
justice
fortas
is
that
you
cannot
in
the
light
of
the
elfbrandt
decision
in
particular
read
this
oath
without
its
statute.
in
elfbrandt,
you'll
recall
justice
fortas
that
the
oath
on
its
face
was
apparently
innocuous.
it
was
even
an
affirmative
declaration
of
allegiance.
one
didn't
find
out
what
the
defect
in
the
oath
was
until
he
read
the
statute
and
discovered
the
legislature
had
put
a
specific
gloss
upon
the
oath
and
a
gloss
that
this
court
found
was
unduly
broad.
the
same
thing
is
true
in
this
case.
we
can't
conceive
of
how
the
oath
can
be
read
without
the
statute,
where
the
attorney
general
himself,
in
his
brief
suggests
that
the
authority
for
requiring
the
appellant
to
execute
the
certification
is
found
in
section
11
of
the
statute.
that's
the
only
authority
that
the
attorney
general
that
any
state
agent
has
for
giving
this
oath.
as
justice
sobeloff
suggested
in
his
special
concurrence
in
whitehill,
i
am
inclined
to
agree
that
the
prescribed
oath
or
statement
is
not
to
be
judged
in
isolation
but
in
conjunction
with
the
statute.
for
in
the
absence
of
a
statute,
there
would
be
no
authority
for
demanding
any
statement
under
the
penalty
of
perjury.
there
is
no
other
basis
for
this
statement
to
be
requested
or
rather
demanded
of
these
people.
that's
the
only
authority
the
state
has
to
ask
the
--
it's
not
possible,
we
submit
to
therefore
read
the
oath
without
its
underlying
statutory
authority.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
we
submit
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--
that
he
has
no
authority
to
say
that.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
certainly
it
is.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
just
as
in
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
just
as
in
the
sweezy
case,
this
court
decided
that
it
could
not
really
tell
whether
the
attorney
general
had
authority
to
ask
the
questions
he
was
asking
because
he
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
whether
he
has
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--
authority
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
it
certainly
is
in
the
first
amendment
area,
that's
the
sweezy
case
indicates.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
on
the
sweezy
case
justice
stewart,
the
attorney
general
was
authorized
somehow,
by
the
legislature
of
new
hampshire
to
make
inquiry
to
investigate
subversive
activities
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
the
supreme
court,
this
court
overturned
i
believe
a
contempt
citation
of
one
called
sweezy
basically
on
the
grounds
that
it
didn't
know
what
the
authority,
the
scope
of
authority
of
the
attorney
general
was
in
the
--
in
this
first
amendment
area
without
some
clear
--
very
clear
statement
to
the
authority
of
the
attorney
general.
his
activities
would
therefore
abridge
first
amendment
rights
which
--
including
academic
freedom.
now
in
this
case,
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--
the
attorney
general
is
performing
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--
exigent
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
oh,
i
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
first,
we
believe
that
the
three-judge
court
was
in
error
and
their
examination
of
the
issue
was
certainly
a
very
limited
one
at
the
time.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
they
did
accept
the
oath
as
construed
by
the
attorney
general
but
only
because
of
the
decision
in
gerende.
they
felt
incumbent
upon
them
to
accept
it
on
the
basis
of
gerende.
however,
as
we've
suggested
gerende
is
dubious
authority
today.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
what?
the
attorney
general
is
without
authority?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
oh,
we
can't
say
for
sure
that
he's
utterly
without
authority.
what
we're
suggesting
is
that
his
basis
for
authority
is
this
court's
decision
in
gerende
and
the
court's
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
maryland's
decision
in
shub.
now
both
of
those
decisions
presumably
upheld
an
oath
in
specific
terms.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
justice
frankfurter
in
the
garner
case
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--
the
same
term
as
the
gerende.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that's
right.
he
does
not
have
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that's
right.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that
is
in
effect
correct.
but
we
would
like
to
buttress
this
by
suggesting
in
the
garner
case,
justice
frankfurter
suggested,
and
that
was
in
the
same
term
as
gerende.
the
attorney
general
of
maryland
did
not
give
this
assurance,
the
assurance
he
gave
in
the
gerende
case.
as
a
matter
of
personal
relaxation,
i
believe
a
requirement.
he
was
able
to
give
it
on
the
basis
of
the
interpretation
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland,
the
highest
court
of
that
state
had
placed
upon
the
legislation.
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
has
not
pass
upon
this
legislation
since
that
statement
was
made.
all
he
has
to
go
on
is
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
the
oath
that
was
made
in
the
shub
case
back
in
1950,
and
the
operative
legal
rules
with
respect
to
first
amendment
interest
in
the
oath
area,
particularly
with
respect
to
vagueness,
breadth,
and
indefiniteness,
have
been
significantly
changed.
as
he
himself
recognized
by
attempting
to
delete
from
the
oath
--
the
phrase
i
--
and
i
am
not
a
member
of
--
knowingly
a
member
of
an
organization
engaged
in
such
an
attempt.
now
he
can
try
to
do
that,
he
can
delete
it
from
the
oath.
but
of
course
if
we're
right
in
our
view
that
the
oath
can't
be
read
without
the
statute,
that
won't
get
him
anywhere.
and
we
suggest
further
that
it's
entirely
possible
if
he
has
no
authority
to
act.
so,
in
particularly
in
this
first
amendment
area,
it's
incumbent
upon
the
court
to
closely
examine
whether
or
not
he
has
such
authority
to
act.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes
sir.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes
sir.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no.
there
was
a
claim
that
as
a
quaker
he
had
conscientious
scruples
against
making
this
kind
of
a
declaration
but
it
wasn't
necessarily
the
difference
between
an
oath
and
affirmation
or
a
certification.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes,
i
believe
it
is
the
equivalent
of
an
affirmation
but
he
has
conscientious
scruples
against
making
this
a
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--affirmation.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
he
thinks
that
it's
a
viable
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
because
he'd
--
can't
understand
what
the
oath
means
particularly
when
read
with
the
statute.
he
thinks
it
may
be
in
violation
of
his
first
amendment
free
speech
rights
but
also
there
are
some
questions
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well
we
didn't
make
much
of
a
point
of
it
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that's
right.
we're
not
pressing
this
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes.
but
this
--
we
agree
with
the
equivalent
of
an
affirmation.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes.
well,
i
see
that
my
time
is
up
your
honors.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--
from
the
statute,
the
definitional
provisions
of
which
were
identical
to
those
voided
in
the
baggett
and
dombrowski
cases
are
unconstitutionally
fraud,
vague
and
indefinite.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
comparatively
simple.
it's
a
direct
appeal
from
a
final
order
and
judgment
of
a
statutory
three-judge
court
sitting
in
maryland,
dismissing
the
appellant's
complaint
on
the
grounds
of
a
prior
precedent
to
this
court.
the
appellant,
a
quaker,
is
an
author
of
works
of
fiction
and
nonfiction,
and
a
teacher
of
creative
writing
at
the
johns
hopkins
university.
he
was
invited
in
the
summer
of
1966
to
teach
creative
writing
at
the
university
of
maryland
for
the
academic
year
of
1966-1967.
he
was
to
be
paid
$7,000
over
10
months.
in
july,
he
received
by
mail
a
copy
of
the
contract
to
be
signed
and
certain
other
documents
including
the
certification
of
applicant
for
public
employment
which
if
i
may
i'd
like
to
read
to
the
court.
it's
captioned
required
by
law,
article
85a,
paragraph
13
annotated
code
of
maryland
1957.
it
appears
by
the
way
in
the
transcript
at
page
11
in
the
appendix
of
the
appellant's
brief
at
page
16a.
it
states,
“i,
--
leaving
space
for
the
name
--,
do
hereby
certify
that
i
am
not
engaged
in
one
way
or
another
in
an
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states,
or
the
state
of
maryland,
or
any
political
subdivision
of
either
of
them,
by
force
or
violence.
i
further
certify
that
i
understand
the
aforegoing
statement
is
made
subject
to
the
penalties
of
perjury
prescribed
in
article
27,
section
439
of
the
annotated
code
of
maryland,”
--
and
there's
a
space
for
the
date
and
the
signature.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
the
appellant
signed
the
contract,
executed
the
other
papers
with
the
exception
of
the
loyalty
of.
he
returned
these
documents
and
advised
his
correspondent
in
a
separate
letter
that
on
conscientious
grounds
he
would
not
sign
the
required
oath.
he
offered
to
teach
by
the
way
without
compensation
pending
adjudication
of
the
constitutional
issues.
he
received
a
reply
informing
him
that
the
university
could
not
accept
his
services
until
he
had
executed
and
filed
the
oath.
on
august
19,
1966,
he
filed
a
class
action.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
more
or
less
specific?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
would
say
in
the
context
to
the
statute
which
is
the
only
way
that
the
oath
can
be
read,
it's
much
less
specific.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
it's
the
appellant's
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
at
this
time,
yes
justice
harlan.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
however,
he
has
to
take
this
oath
as
authorized
under
a
specific
statute
and
it's
our
contention
that
the
gerende
case,
if
that's
what
you're
referring
to
justice
harlan,
does
not
really
hold
for
the
proposition
that
the
oath
can
be
read
without
the
statute.
and
if
it
does,
the
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court
will
make
it
quite
clear
that
an
oath
cannot
be
considered
outside
of
the
context
of
its
statute.
and
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
we
believe
that
that's
what
the
elfbrandt
case
indicates.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
the
oath
itself
is
quite
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
it
has
two
references.
it
has
a
caption
and
it
also
provides
that
it's
subject
to
the
penalties
of
perjury
and
the
only
way
in
which
this
could
be
subject
to
the
penalties
of
perjuries
on
a
statutory
basis
which
is
also
a
reference
to
the
statute
ultimately.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes,
but
this
would
be
statutory
perjury
and
the
only
statute
it
provides
for
the
oath
happens
to
be
the
overact
itself.
in
addition,
the
phrase
in
one
way
or
another
we
contend
is
unduly
broad
and
vague.
but
your
honor
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
if
it
stood
alone
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
and
that's
all
the
statute
said
justice
fortas.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well
this
particular
oath
to
me
would
still
suggest
is
unduly
vague
to
the
extent
that
it
has
the
phrase
in
one
way
or
another
in
it
which
defies
the
definition
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
certainly.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
but
it
says
in
one
way
or
another.
that
could
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
by
force
or
violence.
that
could
be
read
to
mean
the
“in
one
way
or
another”
phrase
that
mere
adherence
to
an
organization
that's
engaged
in
an
attempt
or
about
to
be
engaged
in
an
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
it
--
it's
not
clear.
the
only
judicial
determination
of
the
statute
and
oath
other
than
the
gerende
case
is
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland's
decision
in
the
shub
case
in
1950.
and
while
--
one
could
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
attempted
to
narrow
the
construction
of
the
actual
statute,
it
certainly
isn't
clear
and
it's
our
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
reading
of
the
statute
would
contemplate
mere
advocacy
of
abstract
ideas
within
the
ambit
of
the
statute
and
therefore
the
oath.
and
also
mere
membership,
mere
knowing
membership
in
an
organization,
not
even
necessarily
qualified
to
active
membership
and
certainly
not
qualified
to
membership
with
specific
intent
to
support
the
goals,
the
unlawful
goals
of
the
organization.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
our
argument
is
that
the
oath
as
read
with
the
statute
as
construed
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
clearly
contemplates
that
which
this
court
declared
unconstitutionally
broad
and
vague
in
keyishian
and
elfbrandt
and
baggett.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
if
the
statute
is
just
left
out
entirely,
well
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--
we
have
great
deal
of
difficulty
leaving
the
statute
out.
there's
no
other
authority
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--
in
the
oath.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
but
leaving
the
statute
out,
it's
our
position
that
the
phrase
“in
one
way
or
another"
which
is
a
phrase
admitted
--
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
and
by
this
court
in
the
gerende
case
has
no
definite
meaning.
and
if
it
does
have
a
definite
meaning,
it's
too
broad.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
if
you
insist
justice
fortas
that
we
have
to
leave
the
statute
out,
i
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
do
rely
upon
that
phrase
but
we
also
make
an
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
we
also
make
another
substantive
argument
with
respect
to
the
oath
if
it's
read
by
itself
and
that
is
we
believe
that
these
negative
disclaimers
by
themselves,
by
their
very
nature,
violations
of
the
first
amendment
that
--
just
is
across
the
board
requirement
that
one
say,
“i
am
not
disloyal”,
whatever
that
means.
but
that's
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
in
addition,
we
suggest
as
the
brief
amicus
curiae
of
the
aaup
did
that
this
kind
of
an
oath,
not
giving
anybody
an
opportunity
to
explain
or
get
clarification
of
the
oath
or
explain
his
reasons
for
not
stating
he
is
not
disloyal
that
by
not
giving
any
opportunity
for
a
hearing
or
an
explanation
that
the
oath
violates
procedural
due
process
in
the
first
amendment
context.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that's
a
harder
case
justice
fortas
of
course.
i
think
we
might
be
willing
to
argue
that
there's
no
warrant
for
an
across
the
board
declaration
by
all
persons
but
i
think
we
might
fall
back
to
an
intermediate
position
and
suggest
that
if
teachers
were
singled
out
as
the
only
group
to
swear,
only
group
among
public
employees
that
that
would
raise
people
protection
problems
for
us
if
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
right.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no.
in
this
case,
we
don't
think
we
have
to
reach
the
question
whether
an
affirmative
declaration
of
allegiance
is
unconstitutional.
we
certainly
see
that
there's
a
basis
in
the
text
of
the
constitution
itself
for
this
kind
of
a
declaration.
so
i
can't
answer
that
question
so
far
as
my
client
is
concerned.
definitively,
we're
faced
with
a
negative
disclaimer
and
it's
not
an
affirmative
declaration.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
we'd
have
a
lot
more
trouble,
i
must
admit
with
that
affirming
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
we
do
go
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
a
loyalty
oath
that
requires
a
negative
disclaimer,
i
am
not
disloyal,
i
am
not
a
subversive
person,
i
am
not
engaged
in,
that
this
carries
such
encored
connotations
that
it
is
itself
an
undue
burden
on
the
first
amendment.
so
far
as
an
affirmative
statement
of
allegiance
is
concerned,
we
don't
go
so
far
in
this
case
as
to
argue
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
we'd
like
to
see
that
case
before
we
had
to
address
ourselves
to
the
particular
issue
of
course.
if
i
may
proceed
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
it
could
be
taken
to
mean
other
than
by
force
or
violence
and
certainly
even
if
read
to
be
modified
by
force
or
violence,
it
could
be
taken
to
mean
adherence
to
an
organization
engaged
or
about
to
be
engaged
and
overthrow
without
any
specific
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that's
right.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
that's
not
quite
accurate
justice
harlan.
maryland
didn't
do
that
and
attorney
general
of
maryland
made
a
recommendation.
just
as
an
attorney
general
in
gerende
stated
that
he
would
advise
various
officials
in
the
state
to
give
the
oath
that
was
approved
or
apparently
approved
in
gerende.
as
a
matter
of
fact
justice
harlan,
that
oath
was
never
consistently
given,
there
are
subdivisions
in
this
--
in
the
state
of
maryland
they're
still
giving
the
oath
in
terms
of
the
definitional
phrase
in
section
1
of
the
act.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
right.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that's
right.
so
far
as
the
oath
that
mr.
whitehill
was
requested
or
required
to
sign,
it
did
not
include
the
membership
provision.
i
will
argue
further
along
that
the
attorney
general
probably
has
no
authority
or
not
adequate
authority,
or
power
to
rewrite
the
oath
and
you
certainly
has
adequate
authority
or
power
to
rewrite
the
statute
which
was
judicially
construed
albeit
not
as
clearly
as
we
would
like
in
the
shub
case.
basically,
appellant
agrees
that
the
first
issue
before
the
court
is
the
current
status
of
the
gerende
decision.
however,
before
addressing
or
readdressing
myself
as
the
case
maybe
to
gerende,
it
might
be
appropriate
for
me
to
just
outline
briefly
the
four
substantive
or
meritorious
grounds
on
which
appellant
contends
that
the
oath
and
the
statute
are
unconstitutional.
first,
i
suggest
that
it's
our
position
that
the
oath
and
the
statute
were
unconstitutionally
broad,
vague
and
uncertain
in
degradation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
clause.
second,
we
contend
that
this
indiscriminate
loyalty
of
or
non-disloyalty
disclaimer,
otherwise
unconstitutionally
infringes
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
freedoms
of
belief,
association
and
academic
freedom.
third,
in
violation
of
procedural
due
process,
the
oath
and
the
statute
further
infringe
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
interests
by
denying
public
employment
without
affording
any
hearing
on
questions
of
loyalty
or
subversiveness
and
by
shifting
burdens
of
proof
with
respect
to
these
questions
to
the
applicant.
and
fourth,
together
the
statute
and
the
oath
constitute
an
unlawful
bill
of
attainder.
now
this
court's
decision
in
gerende,
the
1951
very
brief
per
curiam
decision
in
gerende
involved
section
15
of
the
act,
so-called
candidate's
oath.
in
gerende,
the
court
relied
upon
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland's
construction
of
that
provision
in
shub
versus
simpson.
perhaps
if
i
could
refresh
your
honor's
memories
with
respect
to
gerende,
in
that
case
you
said,
“the
scope
of
the
state
law
was
passed
on
--
in
shub".
we
read
this
decision
to
hold
that
to
obtain
a
place
on
a
maryland
ballot
for
candidate
need
only
make
oath
that
he
is
not
a
person
who
is
engaged
"in
one
way
or
another
in
the
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
or
violation,”
and
that
he
is
not
knowingly
a
member
of
an
organization
engaged
in
such
an
attempt.
at
the
bar
of
this
court,
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
maryland
declared
that
he
would
advise
the
proper
authorities
to
and
accept
an
affidavit
in
these
terms
to
satisfying
in
full
the
statutory
requirement.
under
these
circumstances
and
with
this
understanding,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
now
appellees
insist
that
the
decision
in
gerende
in
effect
severs
the
certification
or
oath
from
the
statute
and
insulates
it,
claimed
innocuous
on
its
face
as
we've
just
discussed
from
constitutional
attack.
appellant
respectfully
disagrees.
first,
the
certification
is
not
innocuous
on
its
phase.
both
the
supreme
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
professor
whitehill
is
still
teaching
at
the
johns
hopkins
university,
he
recently
published
a
novel
as
a
matter
of
fact.
but
he
lives
in
maryland.
he
was
ready,
willing
and
able
to
fulfill
the
contract
at
any
time
during
his
term.
he
is
currently
a
lecturer
in
english,
teaching
creative
writing
at
johns
hopkins.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
the
university
of
maryland,
the
college
of
art.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
for
the
academic
year
1966-1967,
an
academic
year
which
would
have
ended
in
june
of
1967th.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
no
more
than
there
was
in
bond
versus
floyd
last
term.
professor
whitehill
would
have
claimed
on
back
wages
at
very
least.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
$7,000.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well
this
would
have
been
an
addition
to
his
job
at
hopkins.
there
is
no
real
question
of
mitigation.
this
was
a
one-day
or
two-day
a
week
operation
and
it's
not
the
sort
of
thing
that
a
man
could
go
out
and
mitigate.
he
was
filling
in
for
a
specific
post,
you
don't
have
too
many
instructors
of
creative
writing
around
nor
do
you
in
--
in
a
given
state
have
too
many
opportunities
to
teach
creative
writing.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
the
question
of
mootness
has
not
been
raised
and
as
i
suggested,
the
bond
case
indicates
that
it
would
not
appropriately
be
raised
and
there's
johnson
versus
branch,
the
fourth
circuit
decision
dealing
with
dismissal
of
certain
school
teachers.
it
indicate
that
the
damages
themselves
would
be
adequate
--
of
course
further
there
--
this
is
a
continuing
situation
maybe
not
directly
with
respect
to
professor
whitehill.
but
we
have
a
file
of
additional
people
and
could
be
--
we
could
come
in
to
court
tomorrow
and
file
a
new
suit
in
the
district
of
maryland
and
if
need
to
be
there,
or
continually
cases
coming
up
in
maryland
at
this
time.
now
as
we
suggested,
the
certification
is
not
innocuous
on
its
face.
first,
the
supreme
court
and
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
authorized
a
prohibition
of
knowing
membership
in
an
organization
engaged
in
an
attempt
to
violently
overthrow
the
government
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well
if
you
struck
in
one
way
or
another
justice
marshall,
i
supposed
that
the
oath
would
become
comparatively
unvague.
however,
we
would
still
rely
upon
our
two
or
three
other
arguments
that
first
this
kind
of
a
negative
oath,
a
negative
disclaimer
itself
violates
the
first
amendment.
it's
taken
up
on
point
too
in
our
brief
in
effect.
and
second,
that
by
not
affording
any
procedural
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that
might
be
what
we've
been
forced
to
ask
justice
marshall.
we
--
we're
not
saying
that
you
can't
in
all
circumstances
certainly
ask
somebody
whether
he
will
adhere
to
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
the
implications
of
asking
the
negative
as
dr.
glass
--
eventually
glass
suggested,
it's
like
asking
a
man
whether
he's
being
unfaithful.
the
implication
carries
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
did
i
mind
taking
the
oath
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--
when
i
became
a
member
of
the
bar?
it
was
an
affirmative
oath
as
i
recall.
i
might
say,
i
didn't
mind
taking
the
oath
for
my
employment
with
the
university
of
maryland.
i
found
that
it
exceedingly
offensive.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no,
i
did
not
mind
taking
the
oath
which
as
i
recall,
in
connecticut
it
was
an
oath
or
affirmation
to
support
the
laws
and
constitution.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that's
true.
and
of
course,
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
konigsberg
and
staff
locations
indicated
that
this
kind
of
inquiry
might
be
appropriate.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well
we
have
suggest
--
we
have
suggested
in
our
oath
that
--
i
mean,
in
our
brief
that
the
--
that
particularly
with
respect
to
the
question
of
subversiveness
which
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that's
a
different
area.
it
doesn't
involve
the
first
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
supposed
one
can
be
asked
that
it's
germane
to
whether
or
not
you're
--
you
should
be
admitted
to
practice.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
it's
just
a
negative
oath,
justice
white.
it's
not
in
the
first
amendment
area.
what's
you're
asking
mr.
whitehill
is
to
say
is
i
am
not
subversive.
that
is,
i
do
not
hold
or
act
upon
certain
political
ideals
which
is
purely
first
amendment
matter.
if
you
ask
a
man
who
is
to
be
admitted
to
the
practice
of
law,
have
you
ever
been
convicted
of
a
felony?
that
doesn't
to
me
raise
very
many
first
amendment
implications.
we're
in
the
area
of
the
first
amendment
and
this
as
the
court
will
notice
is
a
very
special
area
and
distinguishable
at
least
on
that
basis.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well
that
raises
precisely
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--
one
of
the
grounds
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that's
right.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well
that's
what
the
oath
says
and
i
agree
with
justice
fortas,
it
is
rather
silly.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
we
say
of
course
that
the
phrase
“in
one
way
or
another”
means
subversive
activities
of
course
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
the
court
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
of
course
we
don't
read
that
phrase
as
you
do.
at
this
moment
justice
fortas,
further,
we
suggest
that
the
very
narrowness
of
the
oath
if
that's
the
way
you
read
it
which
speaks
and
as
you
suggested
foolishly
of,
“are
you
at
present,
this
moment,
this
instant
in
history,
engaged
in
an
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government?"
the
very
narrowness
of
that
inquiry
only
highlights
section
14
of
the
statute
and
section
10
of
the
statute.
section
10
says
that
no
subversive
person
shall
be
employed
by
the
state.
section
14
provides
for
continual
surveillance
of
persons
in
the
employee
of
the
state,
including
teachers,
including
mr.
whitehill
had
he
been
employed
by
the
state.
continual
surveillance
of
these
people
to
determine
whether
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--
in
the
future
they
become
subversive
persons.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes
we
are.
we
are
arguing
--
our
basic
argument
justice
fortas
is
that
you
cannot
in
the
light
of
the
elfbrandt
decision
in
particular
read
this
oath
without
its
statute.
in
elfbrandt,
you'll
recall
justice
fortas
that
the
oath
on
its
face
was
apparently
innocuous.
it
was
even
an
affirmative
declaration
of
allegiance.
one
didn't
find
out
what
the
defect
in
the
oath
was
until
he
read
the
statute
and
discovered
the
legislature
had
put
a
specific
gloss
upon
the
oath
and
a
gloss
that
this
court
found
was
unduly
broad.
the
same
thing
is
true
in
this
case.
we
can't
conceive
of
how
the
oath
can
be
read
without
the
statute,
where
the
attorney
general
himself,
in
his
brief
suggests
that
the
authority
for
requiring
the
appellant
to
execute
the
certification
is
found
in
section
11
of
the
statute.
that's
the
only
authority
that
the
attorney
general
that
any
state
agent
has
for
giving
this
oath.
as
justice
sobeloff
suggested
in
his
special
concurrence
in
whitehill,
i
am
inclined
to
agree
that
the
prescribed
oath
or
statement
is
not
to
be
judged
in
isolation
but
in
conjunction
with
the
statute.
for
in
the
absence
of
a
statute,
there
would
be
no
authority
for
demanding
any
statement
under
the
penalty
of
perjury.
there
is
no
other
basis
for
this
statement
to
be
requested
or
rather
demanded
of
these
people.
that's
the
only
authority
the
state
has
to
ask
the
--
it's
not
possible,
we
submit
to
therefore
read
the
oath
without
its
underlying
statutory
authority.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
we
submit
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--
that
he
has
no
authority
to
say
that.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
certainly
it
is.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
just
as
in
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
just
as
in
the
sweezy
case,
this
court
decided
that
it
could
not
really
tell
whether
the
attorney
general
had
authority
to
ask
the
questions
he
was
asking
because
he
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
whether
he
has
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--
authority
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
it
certainly
is
in
the
first
amendment
area,
that's
the
sweezy
case
indicates.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
on
the
sweezy
case
justice
stewart,
the
attorney
general
was
authorized
somehow,
by
the
legislature
of
new
hampshire
to
make
inquiry
to
investigate
subversive
activities
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
the
supreme
court,
this
court
overturned
i
believe
a
contempt
citation
of
one
called
sweezy
basically
on
the
grounds
that
it
didn't
know
what
the
authority,
the
scope
of
authority
of
the
attorney
general
was
in
the
--
in
this
first
amendment
area
without
some
clear
--
very
clear
statement
to
the
authority
of
the
attorney
general.
his
activities
would
therefore
abridge
first
amendment
rights
which
--
including
academic
freedom.
now
in
this
case,
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--
the
attorney
general
is
performing
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--
exigent
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
oh,
i
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
first,
we
believe
that
the
three-judge
court
was
in
error
and
their
examination
of
the
issue
was
certainly
a
very
limited
one
at
the
time.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well,
they
did
accept
the
oath
as
construed
by
the
attorney
general
but
only
because
of
the
decision
in
gerende.
they
felt
incumbent
upon
them
to
accept
it
on
the
basis
of
gerende.
however,
as
we've
suggested
gerende
is
dubious
authority
today.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
what?
the
attorney
general
is
without
authority?
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
oh,
we
can't
say
for
sure
that
he's
utterly
without
authority.
what
we're
suggesting
is
that
his
basis
for
authority
is
this
court's
decision
in
gerende
and
the
court's
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
maryland's
decision
in
shub.
now
both
of
those
decisions
presumably
upheld
an
oath
in
specific
terms.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
justice
frankfurter
in
the
garner
case
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--
the
same
term
as
the
gerende.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that's
right.
he
does
not
have
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that's
right.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that
is
in
effect
correct.
but
we
would
like
to
buttress
this
by
suggesting
in
the
garner
case,
justice
frankfurter
suggested,
and
that
was
in
the
same
term
as
gerende.
the
attorney
general
of
maryland
did
not
give
this
assurance,
the
assurance
he
gave
in
the
gerende
case.
as
a
matter
of
personal
relaxation,
i
believe
a
requirement.
he
was
able
to
give
it
on
the
basis
of
the
interpretation
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland,
the
highest
court
of
that
state
had
placed
upon
the
legislation.
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
has
not
pass
upon
this
legislation
since
that
statement
was
made.
all
he
has
to
go
on
is
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
the
oath
that
was
made
in
the
shub
case
back
in
1950,
and
the
operative
legal
rules
with
respect
to
first
amendment
interest
in
the
oath
area,
particularly
with
respect
to
vagueness,
breadth,
and
indefiniteness,
have
been
significantly
changed.
as
he
himself
recognized
by
attempting
to
delete
from
the
oath
--
the
phrase
i
--
and
i
am
not
a
member
of
--
knowingly
a
member
of
an
organization
engaged
in
such
an
attempt.
now
he
can
try
to
do
that,
he
can
delete
it
from
the
oath.
but
of
course
if
we're
right
in
our
view
that
the
oath
can't
be
read
without
the
statute,
that
won't
get
him
anywhere.
and
we
suggest
further
that
it's
entirely
possible
if
he
has
no
authority
to
act.
so,
in
particularly
in
this
first
amendment
area,
it's
incumbent
upon
the
court
to
closely
examine
whether
or
not
he
has
such
authority
to
act.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes
sir.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes
sir.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
no.
there
was
a
claim
that
as
a
quaker
he
had
conscientious
scruples
against
making
this
kind
of
a
declaration
but
it
wasn't
necessarily
the
difference
between
an
oath
and
affirmation
or
a
certification.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes,
i
believe
it
is
the
equivalent
of
an
affirmation
but
he
has
conscientious
scruples
against
making
this
a
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
--affirmation.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
he
thinks
that
it's
a
viable
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
because
he'd
--
can't
understand
what
the
oath
means
particularly
when
read
with
the
statute.
he
thinks
it
may
be
in
violation
of
his
first
amendment
free
speech
rights
but
also
there
are
some
questions
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
well
we
didn't
make
much
of
a
point
of
it
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
that's
right.
we're
not
pressing
this
--
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes.
but
this
--
we
agree
with
the
equivalent
of
an
affirmation.
mr.
sanford
jay
rosen
yes.
well,
i
see
that
my
time
is
up
your
honors.
thank
you
very
much.
