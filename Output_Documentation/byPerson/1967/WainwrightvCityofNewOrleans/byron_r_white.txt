let's
assume
the
arrest
was
for
resisting
an
officer.
what
about
that?
justice

yes.
justice
byron

yes,
but
he
refused

he
refused

why
do
you

why
do
you
shy
away

i
mean
what
if
he
did
say
i
refuse
to
take
my
hat
off
and
the
officers
try
to
make
him
take
his

now
what's
that

i
would
assume
under

the
argument
in

brief
that
he
had
a
perfectly
right
to
do
that.
and
the

had
no

do
you
know

for
effusing
to
take
his

and
he
could
be
reasonable
forced

in
your
argue

in
your

you
could
use
reasonable
force
to
resist
it.

you
don't

you
don't

that's
a
--
you
don't
think
there
that
you
could
make
an
offense
of
resisting
the
officer,
resisting
an
officer
out
of
an
official
request
to
take
off
his
hat
and
refusing
to
do
so.
