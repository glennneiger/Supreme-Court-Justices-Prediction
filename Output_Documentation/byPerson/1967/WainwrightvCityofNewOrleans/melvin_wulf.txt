mr.
melvin
wulf
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
conviction
from
the
state
courts
of
louisiana
finding
petitioner
guilty
of
two
counts
of
breach
of
the
peace
for
assaulting
a
police
officer.
the
central
issue
revolves
around
questions
of
alleged
illegal
arrest,
alleged
illegal
search
and
in
all
such
cases
the
facts
of
paramount
and
i
would
like
to
review
those
to
begin.
the
petitioner
just
about
three
years
ago
today
on
october
12,
1964
was
then
a
law
student
of
tulane
university
law
school
in
new
orleans.
he
lived
in
the
french
quarter
in
that
city.
he
left
his
apartment
one
night
at
about
midnight
to
get
something
to
eat.
about
four
blocks
from
his
apartment,
he
was
stopped
by
two
police
officers
of
the
new
orleans
police
department
who
said
they
wanted
to
question
him
because,
he
used
their
words,
he
“resembled”
the
composite
picture
of
a
man
who
was
somehow
rather
involved
in
a
murder
which
have
taken
place
a
few
days
or
week
ago
in
the
city
of
new
orleans.
when
the
petitioner
was
stopped
by
the
police
and
asked
his
name,
he
freely
gave
his
name
and
he
gave
his
correct
name.
when
asked
where
he
lived,
he
gave
his
correct
address.
he
first
said
he
lives
in
the
french
quarter.
he
was
questioned
again.
he
gave
his
précised
street
and
number
address.
when
the
police
then
asked
whether
he
carried
any
identification
he
began
to
walk
away.
the
police
stopped
him,
they
again
asked
for
identification,
and
he
said,
“the
law
says
i
must
only
give
you
my
name
and
address
that's
all
i'm
required
to
do.”
the
police
again
prevented
him
from
walking
away.
one
of
the
police
officers
at
that
point
went
back
to
the
patrol
car
and
got
a
copy
of
the
composite
picture
which
was
the
basis
for
their
suspicion
that
the
petitioner
was
the
man
that
they
were
looking
for.
they
also
knew
in
addition
to
the
composite
picture
that
the
man
they
were
looking
for
car
--
have
a
tattoo
on
his
left
arm
which
read,
born
to
raise
hell.
they
asked
the
petitioner
to
remove
his
jacket
so
that
they
could
examine
his
arm.
before
they
did
that,
however,
they
did
search
the
petitioner.
it's
unclear
whether
they
actually
searched
him
for
identification
or
just
frisked
him.
i
think
the
preponderance
of
the
record
at
least
made
me
conclude
they
just
frisked
rather
they
didn't
put
their
hands
in
his
pocket
as
far
as
i
can
tell.
but
they
did
ask
for
identification,
he
didn't
have
any
on
him
and
they
did
search
him
for
weapons.
they
then
asked
him
to
take
off
his
jacket
so
that
they
could
see
whether
or
not
he
was
tattooed
and
he
refused
to
do
so
saying
among
other
things
that
he
didn't
want
to
be
humiliated
by
the
police.
at
that
point,
he
was
put
under
arrest
and
there
is
no
debate
that
the
grounds
upon
which
he
was
arrested
at
that
moment
were
vagrancy
and
resisting
arrest.
and
the
charge
of
vagrancy
by
loitering
was
based
on
the
fact,
on
three
facts
that
the
police
officer
described
at
the
trial
below.
one,
that
the
petitioner
was
standing
still
for
five
seconds.
two,
that
he
couldn't
show
the
police
officer
any
identification
and
three,
he
had
very
little
money
not
no
money,
just
very
little
money.
and
the
charge
of
resisting
--
mr.
melvin
wulf
because
that
was
--
the
police
officer
at
the
trial
said
that
that
was
the
ground
upon
which
he
took
him
into
custody.
that
was
the
ground
for
which
he
was
put
on
hold.
mr.
melvin
wulf
i
think
my
answer
to
that
is
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
--
mr.
melvin
wulf
yes,
sir.
because
that
is
the
only
justification
seems
to
me.
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
crime
for
which
the
police
have
to
justify
taking
the
individual
into
custody.
mr.
melvin
wulf
i
think
that's
true.
i
think
as
a
matter
of
--
as
a
matter
of
actual
fact
that's
why
they
took
him
in.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that.
they
wanted
to
find
out
whether
he
was
johnny
mctaylor.
but
i
think
the
record
is
clear
that
the
arresting
officer
said
that
not
--
not
only
did
they
charged
him
of
vagrancy
when
they
brought
him
to
the
station
but
i
think
the
record
is
clear
that
at
that
moment
he
determined
to
arrest
him
not
on
the
murder
charge
which
he
couldn't
but
on
the
vagrancy
charge.
mr.
melvin
wulf
yes,
that
there
are
other
alternatives.
mr.
melvin
wulf
we
suggest
several
of
them
in
our
brief.
one,
they
could
have
kept
the
man
under
surveillance,
they
could
have
kept
the
petitioner
under
surveillance
while
the
other
police
officer
checked
with
the
police
station
to
see
whether
they
could
get
any
other
identifying
characteristics
of
the
man
they
were
looking
for.
two,
the
way
that
they
had
--
mr.
melvin
wulf
well,
they
could
have
just
followed
him,
your
honor,
they
could
have
just
followed
him.
wherever
he
might
have
been
going
they
could
have
followed
him
and
this
is
the
standard
police
technique
--
mr.
melvin
wulf
they
could
have
--
true.
or
stood
outside
and
watched
them
eat
the
hamburger.
perhaps
--
perhaps
more
simply,
wainwright
gave
the
police
officers
what
turned
out
to
be
his
correct
name
and
address.
they
could
have
gone
look
in
a
phone
--
new
orleans
phonebook
to
see
whether
that
man's
name
and
address
was
there.
i
think
those
practically
what
they
could
have
done
and
what
petitioner
himself
suggested
to
them
afterwards
when
he
was
taken
to
the
police
station
before
--
before
he
was
taken
into
the
police
station
was
that
he
go
back
to
where
he
said
he
lived
and
produce
whatever
identification
he
had.
he
presumably
had
ample
of
identification
back
home.
the
police
said
that
they
didn't
--
they
didn't
ask
petitioner
to
do
that
during
the
street
corner
confrontation.
the
petitioner
suggested
to
them
just
before
they
got
to
the
station
house
while
they
are
in
the
patrol
car
and
the
police
officer
said,
“no,
we
didn't
do
it
then
because
he
was
then
under
arrest,”
which
is
no
justification
as
far
as
i
can
see
that
--
it
would
not
have
been
too
late
at
that
moment
it
seems
to
me
for
them
to
correct
whatever
errors
they
have
made
and
to
return
to
the
man's
home
in
order
to
find
--
in
order
to
secure
the
identification
they
were
looking
for.
mr.
melvin
wulf
we
must,
yes.
mr.
melvin
wulf
in
the
constitutional
manner
we
say
there
was
no
probable
cause
to
arrest
him.
we
have
a
tangential
argument
that
if
they
did
have
a
cause
to
arrest
him
that
under
the
circumstances
they
could
--
should
not
have
forcibly
removed
his
jacket
on
the
police
station
without
a
search
warrant,
but
i
come
to
that
later
on.
but
i
think
basically
or
perhaps
most
simply
--
most
simply,
it
turns
on
the
validity
of
the
arrest.
after
wainwright
was
taken
to
the
police
station
he
was
put
in
the
interrogation
room,
twice
asked
for
the
right
to
call
his
lawyer.
he
was
denied
the
right
to
call
his
lawyer.
he
was
questioned
for
some
period
of
time,
10
or
15
minutes
before
he
was
taken
out
into
the
main
police
station
to
be
booked.
when
he
was
taken
out
to
be
booked,
he
again
asked
to
call
his
lawyer,
and
the
lieutenant
in
charge
in
the
station
said
you
have
to
be
booked
first.
he
was
booked
and
then
the
lieutenant
said
take
off
your
jacket,
wainwright
refused
to
take
off
his
jacket
and
either
four
or
five
police
officers
and
what
developed
into
a
scuffle
forcibly
removed
wainwright's
jacket
and
saw
then
that
he
had
no
tattoo.
the
facts
of
the
scuffle
are
relevant
too
to
a
later
part
of
the
argument,
i'll
return
to
when
i
reach
it.
finally,
after
his
jacket
was
forcibly
removed
he
was
allowed
to
call
his
lawyer
but
before
his
lawyer
arrived,
wainwright
himself
was
taken
off
to
another
building
to
--
for
further
processing
and
didn't
see
his
lawyer
until
after
he
was
released.
it's
a
matter
of
record,
it's
--
it's
in
the
city's
brief
and
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
that
the
lawyer
himself
was
arrested
because
of
the
disagreement
he
got
into
when
he
got
to
the
police
station
but
that
is
interesting
if
not
relevant
to
the
case
at
bar.
they
were
finally
both
released
about
quarter
to
five
in
the
morning.
in
december
of
that
year,
the
charges
of
vagrancy,
resisting
arrest
and
reviling
the
police,
which
was
an
envisional
charge
because
of
something
that
wainwright
had
said
to
the
police
when
he
was
first
picked
up
and
put
into
the
police
car,
but
it's
rather
minor,
were
brought
to
prosecution
and
at
the
close
of
the
state's
case,
there
were
several
adjournments
and
it
went
on
until
may.
in
may
at
the
close
of
the
state's
case,
those
original
three
charges
were
discontinued
and
in
the
words
of
the
respondents
they
have
been
“long
abandoned.”
the
same
day
that
they
were
discontinued,
three
new
charges
were
lodged
against
the
petitioner,
two
charges
of
disturbing
the
peace
by
assault
on
the
police
officer
and
one
charge
of
resisting
an
officer.
it's
the
former
two
charges
which
are
here
now.
the
third
charge
was
reversed
on
appeal
in
the
criminal
district
court
in
louisiana.
i
just
want
to
briefly
dispose
of
the
suggestion,
i
think
it's
my
own
perhaps
that
this
case
has
anything
to
do
with
the
stop
and
frisk
cases
which
are
going
to
be
argued
here
later
on,
i
don't
think
they
do,
i
think
they're
clearly
distinguishable
at
the
point
where
what
might
be
characterized
as
the
stop
and
frisk
of
which
wainwright
was
a
victim,
nothing
had
happened.
it
was
a
fruitless
stop
and
frisk
that
was
when
they
first
asked
him
to
remove
his
jacket
and
didn't,
and
also
frisked
him
and
found
that
he
didn't
had
any
weapons.
at
that
point,
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
it
normally.
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
an
ordinary
stop
and
frisk,
but
the
police
here
and
i
said
it
would
not
have
been
the
end
of
it,
nothing
more
would
have
been
heard
of
it.
except
of
the
--
because
of
the
persistence
of
the
police
here
in
trying
to
determine
who
this
man
was
by
learning
whether
or
not
he
had
a
tattoo
on
his
arm.
this
goes
well
beyond
stop
and
frisk
and
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
case
of
detention
for
investigation
without
probable
cause.
now,
we
begin
by
asserting
that
there
was
no
probable
cause.
in
my
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
fortas
he
suggested
that
the
arrest
--
the
validity
of
the
arrest
could
be
--
should
be
tested
by
the
real
reason
for
wainwright's
arrest.
i
disagree.
i
think
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
arrest
is
valid
must
turn
on
the
reason
given
by
the
police
and
justification
at
trial
of
taking
this
man
into
custody
and
i
think
it
bears
little
argument
that
to
charge
a
man
with
vagrancy
by
loitering
because
he
was
seen
standing
still
on
the
street
for
five
seconds
must
fall
as
a
matter
of
due
process
under
louisville
v.
thompson
and
garner
v.
--
versus
louisiana,
and
i
will
not
belabor
that
point.
if
the
court
feels
that
it
must
assess
the
question
of
the
arrest
in
terms
of
the
murder,
in
terms
of
the
wainwright
being
taken
into
custody
as
a
murder
suspect,
i
think
there
are
two,
the
arrest
must
fall
because
it
doesn't
have
--
because
of
the
absence
of
probable
cause.
what
the
police
had
--
the
information
that
they
had
was
a
composite
picture
and
a
photograph
of
a
man
who
–
by
their
own
admission
wasn't
known
to
them
to
be
a
murder
but
only
was
somehow
or
other
involved
in
a
murder
that
had
taken
place
some
time
before.
when
they
stopped,
the
composite
picture
apparently
also
had
some
identification
about
the
man
they
were
looking
for
in
terms
of
his
height,
weight
and
approximate
age
and
the
fact
that
he
had
a
tattoo.
well,
the
petitioner
was
stopped
simply
because
of
the
bare
resemblance,
we,
we,
we
don't
--
the
record
--
we
can't
learn
from
the
record
how
close
the
--
a
resemblance
there
was
between
the
composite
and
wainwright
because
although
the
composite
is
in
the
record
there
isn't
a
photograph
of
wainwright
in
the
record,
so
we
don't
know.
mr.
melvin
wulf
because
of
the
events
that
occurred
on
the
street,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
wulf
i
think
that
would
have
to
fall
as
a
matter
of
due
process
also.
it
seems
just
turning
away
from
an
officer
before
he
was
under
arrest.
it's
debatable
exactly
--
mr.
melvin
wulf
ah,
if
--
if
you
would
say
that
--
if
--
if
you
would
make
the
arrest
in
effect
retroactive
that's
the
time
he
was
first
stopped,
i
would
think
that
the
resisting
arrest
under
the
circumstances
of
that
case
--
mr.
melvin
wulf
and
if
he
refused
to
do
so?
mr.
melvin
wulf
i
would
hope
that
if
wainwright
had
been
my
client
that
he
had
taken
his
hat
off.
mr.
melvin
wulf
i
think
it
turns
very
intimately
--
mr.
melvin
wulf
i
think
it
turns
very
intimately
your
honor
in
about
the
sensibility
of
an
individual's
right
to
privacy.
i
think
there's
--
mr.
melvin
wulf
no,
sir.
mr.
melvin
wulf
no,
sir.
you're
quite
right,
i
should
not
have
shied
away
from
that.
the
answer
should
have
been
--
my
argument
would
have
been
precisely
the
same
that
any
order
of
that
sort
by
a
police
officer
could
under
the
circumstances
have
been
legally
refused
by
the
petitioner.
mr.
melvin
wulf
precisely.
yes,
sir.
in
the
ab
--
in
the
absence
of
probable
cause
to
arrest
--
the
absence
of
probable
cause.
mr.
melvin
wulf
no,
i
think
the
police
have
a
perfect
right
to
ask.
i
think
the
victim
or
however
you
might
want
to
characterize,
there
is
a
perfect
right
to
refuse,
yes.
mr.
melvin
wulf
no
ques
--
no
question
at
all
under
the
decisions
of
this
case
your
honor,
yes.
i
think
the
most
telling
--
i
think
the
most
telling
point
in
establishing
that
the
police
did
not
have
a
probable
cause
to
arrest
for
the
crime
of
murder
was
the
fact
that
they
justified
the
arrest
themselves
on
the
ground
of
vagrancy
not
on
the
ground
of
murder.
and
whether
or
not
they
actually
took
the
man
in
at
the
initial
stages
because
of
the
murder,
because
of
the
vagrancy,
the
fact
that
they
put
charge
of
the
prosecute
him
for
vagrancy.
it
seems
to
me
requires
that
the
standard
for
determining
whether
or
not
there
was
just
a
probable
cause
in
the
first
place
taking
him
for
murder
must
be
measured
against
the
city's
own
statement
that
they
arrested
him
then
and
there
for
vagrancy.
mr.
melvin
wulf
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
conviction
from
the
state
courts
of
louisiana
finding
petitioner
guilty
of
two
counts
of
breach
of
the
peace
for
assaulting
a
police
officer.
the
central
issue
revolves
around
questions
of
alleged
illegal
arrest,
alleged
illegal
search
and
in
all
such
cases
the
facts
of
paramount
and
i
would
like
to
review
those
to
begin.
the
petitioner
just
about
three
years
ago
today
on
october
12,
1964
was
then
a
law
student
of
tulane
university
law
school
in
new
orleans.
he
lived
in
the
french
quarter
in
that
city.
he
left
his
apartment
one
night
at
about
midnight
to
get
something
to
eat.
about
four
blocks
from
his
apartment,
he
was
stopped
by
two
police
officers
of
the
new
orleans
police
department
who
said
they
wanted
to
question
him
because,
he
used
their
words,
he
“resembled”
the
composite
picture
of
a
man
who
was
somehow
rather
involved
in
a
murder
which
have
taken
place
a
few
days
or
week
ago
in
the
city
of
new
orleans.
when
the
petitioner
was
stopped
by
the
police
and
asked
his
name,
he
freely
gave
his
name
and
he
gave
his
correct
name.
when
asked
where
he
lived,
he
gave
his
correct
address.
he
first
said
he
lives
in
the
french
quarter.
he
was
questioned
again.
he
gave
his
précised
street
and
number
address.
when
the
police
then
asked
whether
he
carried
any
identification
he
began
to
walk
away.
the
police
stopped
him,
they
again
asked
for
identification,
and
he
said,
“the
law
says
i
must
only
give
you
my
name
and
address
that's
all
i'm
required
to
do.”
the
police
again
prevented
him
from
walking
away.
one
of
the
police
officers
at
that
point
went
back
to
the
patrol
car
and
got
a
copy
of
the
composite
picture
which
was
the
basis
for
their
suspicion
that
the
petitioner
was
the
man
that
they
were
looking
for.
they
also
knew
in
addition
to
the
composite
picture
that
the
man
they
were
looking
for
car
--
have
a
tattoo
on
his
left
arm
which
read,
born
to
raise
hell.
they
asked
the
petitioner
to
remove
his
jacket
so
that
they
could
examine
his
arm.
before
they
did
that,
however,
they
did
search
the
petitioner.
it's
unclear
whether
they
actually
searched
him
for
identification
or
just
frisked
him.
i
think
the
preponderance
of
the
record
at
least
made
me
conclude
they
just
frisked
rather
they
didn't
put
their
hands
in
his
pocket
as
far
as
i
can
tell.
but
they
did
ask
for
identification,
he
didn't
have
any
on
him
and
they
did
search
him
for
weapons.
they
then
asked
him
to
take
off
his
jacket
so
that
they
could
see
whether
or
not
he
was
tattooed
and
he
refused
to
do
so
saying
among
other
things
that
he
didn't
want
to
be
humiliated
by
the
police.
at
that
point,
he
was
put
under
arrest
and
there
is
no
debate
that
the
grounds
upon
which
he
was
arrested
at
that
moment
were
vagrancy
and
resisting
arrest.
and
the
charge
of
vagrancy
by
loitering
was
based
on
the
fact,
on
three
facts
that
the
police
officer
described
at
the
trial
below.
one,
that
the
petitioner
was
standing
still
for
five
seconds.
two,
that
he
couldn't
show
the
police
officer
any
identification
and
three,
he
had
very
little
money
not
no
money,
just
very
little
money.
and
the
charge
of
resisting
--
mr.
melvin
wulf
because
that
was
--
the
police
officer
at
the
trial
said
that
that
was
the
ground
upon
which
he
took
him
into
custody.
that
was
the
ground
for
which
he
was
put
on
hold.
mr.
melvin
wulf
i
think
my
answer
to
that
is
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
--
mr.
melvin
wulf
yes,
sir.
because
that
is
the
only
justification
seems
to
me.
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
crime
for
which
the
police
have
to
justify
taking
the
individual
into
custody.
mr.
melvin
wulf
i
think
that's
true.
i
think
as
a
matter
of
--
as
a
matter
of
actual
fact
that's
why
they
took
him
in.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that.
they
wanted
to
find
out
whether
he
was
johnny
mctaylor.
but
i
think
the
record
is
clear
that
the
arresting
officer
said
that
not
--
not
only
did
they
charged
him
of
vagrancy
when
they
brought
him
to
the
station
but
i
think
the
record
is
clear
that
at
that
moment
he
determined
to
arrest
him
not
on
the
murder
charge
which
he
couldn't
but
on
the
vagrancy
charge.
mr.
melvin
wulf
yes,
that
there
are
other
alternatives.
mr.
melvin
wulf
we
suggest
several
of
them
in
our
brief.
one,
they
could
have
kept
the
man
under
surveillance,
they
could
have
kept
the
petitioner
under
surveillance
while
the
other
police
officer
checked
with
the
police
station
to
see
whether
they
could
get
any
other
identifying
characteristics
of
the
man
they
were
looking
for.
two,
the
way
that
they
had
--
mr.
melvin
wulf
well,
they
could
have
just
followed
him,
your
honor,
they
could
have
just
followed
him.
wherever
he
might
have
been
going
they
could
have
followed
him
and
this
is
the
standard
police
technique
--
mr.
melvin
wulf
they
could
have
--
true.
or
stood
outside
and
watched
them
eat
the
hamburger.
perhaps
--
perhaps
more
simply,
wainwright
gave
the
police
officers
what
turned
out
to
be
his
correct
name
and
address.
they
could
have
gone
look
in
a
phone
--
new
orleans
phonebook
to
see
whether
that
man's
name
and
address
was
there.
i
think
those
practically
what
they
could
have
done
and
what
petitioner
himself
suggested
to
them
afterwards
when
he
was
taken
to
the
police
station
before
--
before
he
was
taken
into
the
police
station
was
that
he
go
back
to
where
he
said
he
lived
and
produce
whatever
identification
he
had.
he
presumably
had
ample
of
identification
back
home.
the
police
said
that
they
didn't
--
they
didn't
ask
petitioner
to
do
that
during
the
street
corner
confrontation.
the
petitioner
suggested
to
them
just
before
they
got
to
the
station
house
while
they
are
in
the
patrol
car
and
the
police
officer
said,
“no,
we
didn't
do
it
then
because
he
was
then
under
arrest,”
which
is
no
justification
as
far
as
i
can
see
that
--
it
would
not
have
been
too
late
at
that
moment
it
seems
to
me
for
them
to
correct
whatever
errors
they
have
made
and
to
return
to
the
man's
home
in
order
to
find
--
in
order
to
secure
the
identification
they
were
looking
for.
mr.
melvin
wulf
we
must,
yes.
mr.
melvin
wulf
in
the
constitutional
manner
we
say
there
was
no
probable
cause
to
arrest
him.
we
have
a
tangential
argument
that
if
they
did
have
a
cause
to
arrest
him
that
under
the
circumstances
they
could
--
should
not
have
forcibly
removed
his
jacket
on
the
police
station
without
a
search
warrant,
but
i
come
to
that
later
on.
but
i
think
basically
or
perhaps
most
simply
--
most
simply,
it
turns
on
the
validity
of
the
arrest.
after
wainwright
was
taken
to
the
police
station
he
was
put
in
the
interrogation
room,
twice
asked
for
the
right
to
call
his
lawyer.
he
was
denied
the
right
to
call
his
lawyer.
he
was
questioned
for
some
period
of
time,
10
or
15
minutes
before
he
was
taken
out
into
the
main
police
station
to
be
booked.
when
he
was
taken
out
to
be
booked,
he
again
asked
to
call
his
lawyer,
and
the
lieutenant
in
charge
in
the
station
said
you
have
to
be
booked
first.
he
was
booked
and
then
the
lieutenant
said
take
off
your
jacket,
wainwright
refused
to
take
off
his
jacket
and
either
four
or
five
police
officers
and
what
developed
into
a
scuffle
forcibly
removed
wainwright's
jacket
and
saw
then
that
he
had
no
tattoo.
the
facts
of
the
scuffle
are
relevant
too
to
a
later
part
of
the
argument,
i'll
return
to
when
i
reach
it.
finally,
after
his
jacket
was
forcibly
removed
he
was
allowed
to
call
his
lawyer
but
before
his
lawyer
arrived,
wainwright
himself
was
taken
off
to
another
building
to
--
for
further
processing
and
didn't
see
his
lawyer
until
after
he
was
released.
it's
a
matter
of
record,
it's
--
it's
in
the
city's
brief
and
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
that
the
lawyer
himself
was
arrested
because
of
the
disagreement
he
got
into
when
he
got
to
the
police
station
but
that
is
interesting
if
not
relevant
to
the
case
at
bar.
they
were
finally
both
released
about
quarter
to
five
in
the
morning.
in
december
of
that
year,
the
charges
of
vagrancy,
resisting
arrest
and
reviling
the
police,
which
was
an
envisional
charge
because
of
something
that
wainwright
had
said
to
the
police
when
he
was
first
picked
up
and
put
into
the
police
car,
but
it's
rather
minor,
were
brought
to
prosecution
and
at
the
close
of
the
state's
case,
there
were
several
adjournments
and
it
went
on
until
may.
in
may
at
the
close
of
the
state's
case,
those
original
three
charges
were
discontinued
and
in
the
words
of
the
respondents
they
have
been
“long
abandoned.”
the
same
day
that
they
were
discontinued,
three
new
charges
were
lodged
against
the
petitioner,
two
charges
of
disturbing
the
peace
by
assault
on
the
police
officer
and
one
charge
of
resisting
an
officer.
it's
the
former
two
charges
which
are
here
now.
the
third
charge
was
reversed
on
appeal
in
the
criminal
district
court
in
louisiana.
i
just
want
to
briefly
dispose
of
the
suggestion,
i
think
it's
my
own
perhaps
that
this
case
has
anything
to
do
with
the
stop
and
frisk
cases
which
are
going
to
be
argued
here
later
on,
i
don't
think
they
do,
i
think
they're
clearly
distinguishable
at
the
point
where
what
might
be
characterized
as
the
stop
and
frisk
of
which
wainwright
was
a
victim,
nothing
had
happened.
it
was
a
fruitless
stop
and
frisk
that
was
when
they
first
asked
him
to
remove
his
jacket
and
didn't,
and
also
frisked
him
and
found
that
he
didn't
had
any
weapons.
at
that
point,
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
it
normally.
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
an
ordinary
stop
and
frisk,
but
the
police
here
and
i
said
it
would
not
have
been
the
end
of
it,
nothing
more
would
have
been
heard
of
it.
except
of
the
--
because
of
the
persistence
of
the
police
here
in
trying
to
determine
who
this
man
was
by
learning
whether
or
not
he
had
a
tattoo
on
his
arm.
this
goes
well
beyond
stop
and
frisk
and
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
case
of
detention
for
investigation
without
probable
cause.
now,
we
begin
by
asserting
that
there
was
no
probable
cause.
in
my
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
fortas
he
suggested
that
the
arrest
--
the
validity
of
the
arrest
could
be
--
should
be
tested
by
the
real
reason
for
wainwright's
arrest.
i
disagree.
i
think
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
arrest
is
valid
must
turn
on
the
reason
given
by
the
police
and
justification
at
trial
of
taking
this
man
into
custody
and
i
think
it
bears
little
argument
that
to
charge
a
man
with
vagrancy
by
loitering
because
he
was
seen
standing
still
on
the
street
for
five
seconds
must
fall
as
a
matter
of
due
process
under
louisville
v.
thompson
and
garner
v.
--
versus
louisiana,
and
i
will
not
belabor
that
point.
if
the
court
feels
that
it
must
assess
the
question
of
the
arrest
in
terms
of
the
murder,
in
terms
of
the
wainwright
being
taken
into
custody
as
a
murder
suspect,
i
think
there
are
two,
the
arrest
must
fall
because
it
doesn't
have
--
because
of
the
absence
of
probable
cause.
what
the
police
had
--
the
information
that
they
had
was
a
composite
picture
and
a
photograph
of
a
man
who
–
by
their
own
admission
wasn't
known
to
them
to
be
a
murder
but
only
was
somehow
or
other
involved
in
a
murder
that
had
taken
place
some
time
before.
when
they
stopped,
the
composite
picture
apparently
also
had
some
identification
about
the
man
they
were
looking
for
in
terms
of
his
height,
weight
and
approximate
age
and
the
fact
that
he
had
a
tattoo.
well,
the
petitioner
was
stopped
simply
because
of
the
bare
resemblance,
we,
we,
we
don't
--
the
record
--
we
can't
learn
from
the
record
how
close
the
--
a
resemblance
there
was
between
the
composite
and
wainwright
because
although
the
composite
is
in
the
record
there
isn't
a
photograph
of
wainwright
in
the
record,
so
we
don't
know.
mr.
melvin
wulf
because
of
the
events
that
occurred
on
the
street,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
wulf
i
think
that
would
have
to
fall
as
a
matter
of
due
process
also.
it
seems
just
turning
away
from
an
officer
before
he
was
under
arrest.
it's
debatable
exactly
--
mr.
melvin
wulf
ah,
if
--
if
you
would
say
that
--
if
--
if
you
would
make
the
arrest
in
effect
retroactive
that's
the
time
he
was
first
stopped,
i
would
think
that
the
resisting
arrest
under
the
circumstances
of
that
case
--
mr.
melvin
wulf
and
if
he
refused
to
do
so?
mr.
melvin
wulf
i
would
hope
that
if
wainwright
had
been
my
client
that
he
had
taken
his
hat
off.
mr.
melvin
wulf
i
think
it
turns
very
intimately
--
mr.
melvin
wulf
i
think
it
turns
very
intimately
your
honor
in
about
the
sensibility
of
an
individual's
right
to
privacy.
i
think
there's
--
mr.
melvin
wulf
no,
sir.
mr.
melvin
wulf
no,
sir.
you're
quite
right,
i
should
not
have
shied
away
from
that.
the
answer
should
have
been
--
my
argument
would
have
been
precisely
the
same
that
any
order
of
that
sort
by
a
police
officer
could
under
the
circumstances
have
been
legally
refused
by
the
petitioner.
mr.
melvin
wulf
precisely.
yes,
sir.
in
the
ab
--
in
the
absence
of
probable
cause
to
arrest
--
the
absence
of
probable
cause.
mr.
melvin
wulf
no,
i
think
the
police
have
a
perfect
right
to
ask.
i
think
the
victim
or
however
you
might
want
to
characterize,
there
is
a
perfect
right
to
refuse,
yes.
mr.
melvin
wulf
no
ques
--
no
question
at
all
under
the
decisions
of
this
case
your
honor,
yes.
i
think
the
most
telling
--
i
think
the
most
telling
point
in
establishing
that
the
police
did
not
have
a
probable
cause
to
arrest
for
the
crime
of
murder
was
the
fact
that
they
justified
the
arrest
themselves
on
the
ground
of
vagrancy
not
on
the
ground
of
murder.
and
whether
or
not
they
actually
took
the
man
in
at
the
initial
stages
because
of
the
murder,
because
of
the
vagrancy,
the
fact
that
they
put
charge
of
the
prosecute
him
for
vagrancy.
it
seems
to
me
requires
that
the
standard
for
determining
whether
or
not
there
was
just
a
probable
cause
in
the
first
place
taking
him
for
murder
must
be
measured
against
the
city's
own
statement
that
they
arrested
him
then
and
there
for
vagrancy.
