mr.

suppose
the

was
that
the

the
police

ask
him
to
take
his

off.
justice

yes.
justice
thurgood

what's
the

between
that

in

justice
thurgood

what's
the
difference
between
asking
a
man
to
raise
his
jacket
or
take
his
hat
off?
justice
thurgood

mr.

is
it
true
that
the
bounce
“bounced
the
policeman
after
all?"
justice
thurgood

is
it
disputed?
justice
thurgood

in
the

justice
thurgood

you
said
he
didn’t
see
it?
justice
thurgood

don’t
we
have
two
court
findings
that
he
did
bounce
them
off
the
wall?
justice
thurgood

what
do
we
do
with
that?
justice
thurgood

justice
thurgood

mr.
seither,
what’s
the
difference
between
two
police
officers
asking
a
citizen
to
do
something
and
ordering
him
to
do
something?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
why
i
like
to
know
what
it
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
take
possession
of
the
policemen
doing
him
a
favor?
justice
thurgood

does
the
favor
go
up
to
the
point
of
arrest
and
then
take
him
to
the
precinct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
want
to
know
when
we
pass
from
the
police
doing
him
a
favor.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
that
when
he
walked
away,
he
was
already
under
arrest.
justice
thurgood
marshall
wasn’t
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
there
was
testimony
in
the
record
by
the
officer
that
he
was
arrested
for
vagrancy.
(voice

--
justice
thurgood

where
is
that
in

record?
i
thought
mr.
wulf
has
said
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
mr.
wulf
gave
us
a
citation
to
the
record.
i
didn’t
make
a
note
of
it
or
what
page.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
go
a
little
deeper
than
that
with
officer
b-o-e-p-p-l-e
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
says
here,
have
you
discussed
this
case
with
any
officers
involved
since
may
7th?
no
sir.
you
didn’t
discuss
it
with
the
same
attorney?
you
haven’t
advised
mr.
marbelo
or
adison
as
to
what
your
testimony
was?
i
believe
you
stated
that
you
put
defendant
under
arrest.
he
started
to
walk
away
and
that
is
why
you
charged
him
with
a
resisting
arrest.
answer,
as
he
attempted
to
walk
off
from
us,
yes.
question,
you
had
already
informed
him
he
was
under
arrest?
yes.
did
you
inform
him
as
to
what
he
was
under
arrest
for?
answer,
vagrancy
by
loitering.
question,
what
was
it
he
did
that
constituted
loitering
in
your
opinion?
we
observed
him
standing
in
a
600
block
of
bourbon
street.
the
subject
had
no
identification
on
this
person.
he
couldn’t
show
us
anything.
what
was
it
that
constituted
loitering?
observed
him
standing
in
the
600

of
bourbon
street.
i
tried
to
get
some
identification.
he
would
not
show
us
any.
he
said
he
didn’t
have
any
to
show.
we
questioned
him
about
what
he
was
doing
there.
after
some
reluctance,
he
said
he
was
going
to
a
restaurant
to
get
something
to
eat.
was
there
anything
else
that
led
you
to
believe
he
was
guilty
of
loitering?
and
the
court
said
that
objective
now.
that
would
indicate.
it
seems
to
me
that
he
was
arrested
for
vagrancy.
and
when
after
that
he
was
arrested
for
vagrancy,
he
started
to
walk
away.
now,
how
can
you
reconcile
this
testimony
to
what
you
have
just
said
that
he
was
arrested
for
all
of
these
things
at
the
police
station?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
he
entitled
to
put
words
in
his
mouth
of
the
opposition
witness?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
had
asked
him
some
leading
questions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you’ve
had
asked
him
leading
questions
on
cross-examination?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn’t
that
what
he
was
doing
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
he
didn’t
say
that
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
159,
he
doesn’t
say
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don’t
want
to
argue.
i
just
want
to
ask
you
the
question
about
--
.
justice
thurgood
marshall
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
after
doing
all
of
this
and
demonstrating
that
he
was
a
vagrant
and
everything
else
in
your
book,
if
he
to
pull
up
his
sleeve,
would
he
have
been
arrested
for
vagrancy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
it
vagrancy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he’d
showed
his
arm
he
wouldn’t
have
been
arrested
for
vagrancy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
suppose
before
they
took
in
into
car,
he
had
shown
his
arm.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what,
he
was
a
vagrant
wasn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
did
violate
the
argument
by
being
vagrant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
that
with
all
these
things
he
did,
he
was
sufficient
to
justify
his
arrest
for
vagrancy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
resisting
an
officer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
is,
if
it’s
a
bitter
end
before
he
was
put
in
the
car,
he
had
shown
his
forearm,
he
would
not
have
been
arrested?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
have
taken
him
into
the
precinct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what’s
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i’m
saying,
you
still
say
that
if
he
showed
his
arm
at
the
very
end,
you
would
have
let
him
go?
justice
thurgood
marshall
before
he
was
put
into
the
car.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
the
purpose
in
stopping
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
they
found
out
that
he
was
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’m
trying
to
get
the
timing
on
this.
at
what
time
would
he
had
been
caught
free?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
know
bourbon
street
pretty
well
(voice
overlap).
about
how
many
people
are
there
at
a
time
on
bourbon
street
dressed
just
like
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
see
him
with
the
same
clothes
on
before
you
stopped
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can’t
you
say
his
clothes
are
part
of
his
vagrancy
charge?
that’s
my
problem.
justice
thurgood
marshall
may
i
ask
you
this?
do
you
take
the
position
that
everything
that
happened
on
the
street
is
irrelevant
in
this
case
(voice

justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that
it
is
relevant?
you
put
on
the
testimony,
did
you
not,
in

to
convict
him
with
that?
