i
was
wondering
you
keep
saying
that
if
they
just
raised
his
jacket,
it
would
have
been
all
right,
but
the
police
ordered
him
to
take
it
off.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
the
police
requested
to
take
it
off.
now
suppose
that
tattoo
had
been
in
the
place
that
was
covered
by
his
trousers,
could
they
have
requested
him
there
to
take
his
trousers
off
to
see
if
he
had
one
and
have
that
mark
and
if
he
didn't,
could
they
have
arrested
him
for
vagrancy?
chief

for

of
it.
