do
you
think
that
comes
within

conventional
contour
to
the

in
the
constitutional

of
the
word,
do
you?

hardly

before
the

can

that
they

what
apart
from

justice
potter
stewart
quite
apart
from
any
questions
of
an
arrest,
legal
or

do
you
think
a
policeman
needs
to
get
a
search
warrant
to
look
at
a
man
to
see
if
he
has
a

or

this

not,
was

was
it
not?
justice

you’ll
have
a
little
difficulty
saying
that
this
is
a
search
in
the
constitutional
meaning
of
that
word,
the
fourth
amendment
meaning.
do
you
have
any
cases
outside
of
schmerber?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
wulf,
as
the
large
underlying
issue
in
this
case,
in
your
opinion,
whether
or
not
a
person
has
a
right
to
use
self-help
against
agents
of
the
government
when
those
agents
violated
constitutional
right?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
the
police
should
take
me
into
custody
and
take
me
down
the
station
house
and
begin
asking
me
questions
in
violation
of
my
rights
under
the
miranda
case?
do
you
think
i
would
have
a
right
to
punch
the
policeman
on
the
nose?
justice
potter
stewart
but
by
hypothesis,
they’re
violating
my
constitutional
rights
let’s
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
as
laid
out
in
miranda
case.
justice
potter
stewart
let’s
assume
he
has
a
right
to
say,
“no,
don’t
search
me.”
and
then
let’s
assume
the
police
continue
the
searching.
at
that
point,
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
bust
him
in
the
face,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
i’d
thought
that
the
various
legal
devices
which
we
as
lawyers
know
about,
the
exclusionary
rule,
right
of
action
under
the
federal
civil
rights
of
legislation
and
so
on
where
--
a
civilized
society
had
substituted
for
physical
force.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
by
way
of
fact,
isn't
it?
we
have
two
convictions
here
and
only
two
before
this
court,
therefore
disturbing
the
peace
in
the
police
station
by
assaulting
police
officers.
justice
potter
stewart
i
must
say,
i've
not
understand
the
relevance
of
any
of
these.
i
don't
see
what
the
vagrancy
has
to
do
with
it
because
we
don't
have
a
vagrancy
conviction
in
front
of
us.
and
let's
just
assume,
assume
without
deciding
that
his
constitutional
rights
were
violated
as
a
result
of
which
he
found
himself
in
custody
in
a
police
station.
isn't
the
basic
issue
in
this
case,
whether
or
not
he
had
the
right
of
self-help
as
against
that
violation?
did
he
have
a
right
to
assault
those
police
officers?
those
were
the
only
convictions
we
have
before.
justice

you
