mr.
richard
c.
seither
seither,
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
the
view
of
the
city
of
new
orleans
that
the
matters,
enlarged
matters
that
the
court
has
asked
the
city
here
today
on
the
fourth,
fifth
and
sixth
amendments.
and
we
will
try
to
eliminate
any
consideration
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
summarily.
now,
it
is
significant
in
the
city’s
view
that
enlisting
authorities,
the
american
civil
liberties
union
which
submitted
an
outstanding
brief,
professional
brief
obviously
written
by
professional
lawyers
in
a
professional
manner,
listed
the
fourth
and
sixth
amendment
and
did
not
cite
in
its
list
of
authorities
of
fifth
amendment.
i
am
asking
this
court
to
consider
the
fifth
amendment
in
this
case
only
bring
it
into
the
case
only
for
consideration.
it
is
important
because
the
wainwright
forces
cite
miranda,
escobedo,
gideon
versus
wainwright.
i’ll
take
those
three
cases.
first,
gideon
versus
wainwright,
the
sixth
amendment,
this
is
not
that
type
of
sixth
amendment
case.
there
is
no
question
that
mr.
wainwright
was
represented
at
all
times
by
counsel
in
the
court
room.
so
let’s
look
at
escobedo
and
miranda.
there
is
no
question,
there
are
no
confessions
here
to
suppress,
no
admissions,
no
statements
of
anytime.
so
if
then
we
cite
escobedo
and
miranda
just
in
reference
to
the
sixth
amendment,
leave
out
the
fifth
amendment
considerations
of
escobedo
and
miranda,
we’re
only
citing
half
of
the
case.
escobedo
and
miranda
primarily
stands
we
submit
for
the
introduction
of
confessions
unlawfully
obtained
and
this
court
has
held.
correctly
we
think
that
a
denial
of
counsel
at
the
time
when
statements
are
made,
would
then
rule
out
on
the
miranda
and
on
the
escobedo
any
incriminatory
statements.
we
bring
the
fifth
amendment
into
this
case
to
say
there
are
no
incriminatory
statements.
there
never
were
any
statements.
there
never
were
any
confessions
entered
into
this
case.
so
gideon
versus
wainwright,
escobedo
and
miranda
go
out
of
the
case.
and
we’ve
met
this
issue
head
on.
we
don’t
want
to
cite
the
effective
date
of
escobedo
and
miranda.
we
wanted
to
meet
the
issues
of
escobedo
and
miranda,
if
your
honors
please.
now
let’s
go
to
the
fourth
amendment.
the
fourth
amendment,
all
cases
cited
have
to
do
with
the
suppression
of
illegally
obtained
evidence.
there
is
no
illegally
obtained
evidence.
there
is
no
evidence,
physical,
real,
and
any
other
kind
of
evidence
in
this
case
for
the
court
to
suppress.
there
was
never
any
offered
that
could
not
have
been
any
offered.
there
was
never
any
sought.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
that
a
man
was
found
murdered
on
october
3,
1963
or
rather
he
was
--
the
date
of
the
murder
was
fixed
at
october
3rd,
but
his
body
was
not
found
until
october
6,
1963.
mr.
wainwright
was
not
arrested
until
october
13,
1963.
mr.
wainwright
was
arrested
because
he
thrice
walked
away
from
investigating
officers
who
told
him
not
to
do
it
after
he
tried
to
do
it
the
first
time.
they
told
him
specifically.
they
were
in
the
course
of
investigating
a
murder.
they
told
him.
they
showed
him.
came
out
a
composite
picture
from
the
murder,
they
said,
“you
resemble
this
man.
all
we
want
to
do
is
question
you
in
relation
to
this
case.
and
when
we
ask,
we
don’t
want
to
arrest
you.”
they
even
told
them
that.
“we
have
a
perfect
out
for
you.
the
man
we
are
seeking
has
a
tattoo
on
his
left
forearm,
on
to
raise
hell.
bare
your
left
forearm
and
go
on
about
your
business
if
you
don’t
have
this
tattoo
on
your
left
forearm.”
now,
there
is
no
doubt
when
i
say
bare
your
left
forearm,
they
didn’t
just
ask
him
to
do
this,
although
there
were
some
people
who
believe,
the
testimony
has
a
little
shake
on
it.
there’s
no
question.
they
did
ask
him
to
remove
his
jacket,
for
all
purposes
of
observing
this
left
forearm.
at
no
time
was
he
ordered
to
remove
his
jacket.
i
say
this
especially
in
answer
to
your
question
yesterday,
mr.
justice
white.
if
this
man
was
charged
with
resisting
arrest
and
he
was,
under
no
time,
i
mean
resisting
an
officer,
never
was
he
charged
with
resisting
arrest.
and
it
is
a
very
important
distinction
here
that
we
must
draw.
but
at
no
time
was
he
arrested
for
resisting
an
officer
in
a
sense
that
he
resisted
an
order
of
the
officers
to
take
off
his
jacket.
he
was
never
ordered
to
take
off
his
jacket
at
the
bourbon
street
scene,
the
arrest
scene.
he
was
requested
to
remove
his
jacket
so
they
could
look
at
his
left
forearm
to
see
if
he
had
a
tattoo.
and
if
he
didn’t
have
a
tattoo,
he
could
go
on
abide
his
business.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
think
it’s
crucial,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
in
the
sense
that
had
he
been
ordered
to
remove
his
jacket
and
refused,
then
he
could
have
conceivably
been
arrested
for
resisting
an
officer.
by
resisting
an
officer’s
order
which
i
believe
is
a
point
mr.
white
raised
yesterday.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
the
police
were
trying
to.
the
whole
testimony
reads
to
that.
the
police,
i
have
the
actual
testimony
if
you
want
me
to
read.
it’s
in
the
record.
it’s
in
the
transcript
of
the
case
and
at
this
point
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
not
because
he
failed
to
bare
his
jacket.
that
is
a
crucial
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
we
passed
from
a
point
of
doing
him
a
favor
when
he
deliberately
walked
away
thrice,
three
times
from
the
officers
when
they
were
investigating.
it
is
most
important
to
this
case.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir
that
is
precisely
the
point,
mr.
justice
marshall
that
i
want
to
stress
in
this
case.
i
believe
that
the
wainwright
forces
have
been
trying
to
establish
and
i
don’t
blame
them.
if
i
were
on
the
defense
side,
i’d
be
doing
it
too.
that
he
was
first
arrested
fro
vagrancy.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir.
no
mr.
justice
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
mr.
justice
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
he
has
said
it
but
it’s
not
so.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
well
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
even
the
civil
liberty
speech
is
in
this
document.
there
is
no
question
in
the
blue
book,
it’s
here,
b168,
169.
your
honors,
please
i
direct
your
attention
to
page
148
in
this
blue
book
which
is
the
response
brief
of
the
city
of
new
orleans.
at
page
148,
defense
counsel
mr.
spencer
asked
the
officer,
the
first
charge
against
him
was
what?
all
three
were
put
on
at
the
same
time.
what
did
you
arrest
him
for
first?
answer,
vagrancy
violating,
and
resisting
an
officer.
those
are
together.
at
what
point
did
you
charge
him
with
resisting
an
officer?
the
charges
were
all
brought
at
the
station.
you
arrested
him
on
bourbon
street?
what
did
you
arrest
him
for?
answer,
resisting
an
officer
and
vagrancy
by
loitering.
how
did
he
resist
you
on
bourbon
street?
by
attempting
to
walk
off.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
boepple?
i
believe
it
was
boepple
that
i
was
saying.
that
is
officer
boepple.
your
honor,
please
what
i
was
citing.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
can
reconcile,
your
honor
please
by
reading
what
i
just
read
from
the
same
officer
under
different
circumstances.
i
believe
a
close
reading
of
that
will
reveal
a
tremendous
amount
of
testifying
by
the
defense
attorney
who
is
putting
words
in
his
mouth.
when
this
man
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir,
i
don’t
think
so.
that’s
my
objection
to
it.
i
do
know
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
sir?
mr.
richard
c.
seither
certainly.
certainly
we’d
do
that
everyday.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
he’s
asking
leading
questions
but
he’s
putting
into
his
mouth
words
that
he
arrested
him
first
for
vagrancy,
because
here,
he
said
which
charge?
the
first
charge
against
him
was
what?
he
said
all
three
were
put
on
at
the
same
time.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
at
148
he
says,
your
honor,
that
it’s
the
same
man.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir,
your
honor,
please
it’s
the
same
man
testifying
under
different
conditions
of
the
same
set
of
facts.
and
all
the
way
through,
all
the
way
through,
the
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
didn’t
mean
to
argue,
your
honor
please
i’m
just
citing
(voice
overlap)
even
the
civil
liberties,
you
need
in
there
splendid
brief
said
that
the
matter,
it’s
undetermined
as
to
which
he
was
arrested
for
first.
now,
that’s
in
the
brief
that
was
submitted
by
civil
liberties
union.
now
it
is
my
position
that
there
is
no
question
that
the
trial
lawyer
was
trying
to
make
out
a
case
of
--
you
mean
you’ve
had
an
arrest
to
this
man
for
vagrancy
first
and
now
you
charge
him
with
resisting
an
arrest
that
had
not
been
made
yet?
and
when
the
police
officer
said
that
it
was
close,
we
don’t
know
which
came
first.
we
arrest
him
all
three
simultaneously,
it
looked
at
that
point
as
a
very
strong
position
for
mr.
wainwright
because
throughout
this
the
early
proceedings
of
this
case,
they
persisted
in
calling
this
a
charge
of
resisting
arrest.
and
the
city
has
shown,
and
will
show
and
that
record
shows,
and
the
exact
transcript
for
this,
the
man
was
charged
with
resisting
an
officer.
he
was
arraigned
for
resisting
an
officer.
the
original
affidavit
which
is
in
the
record
is
on
resisting
an
officer.
he
was
tried
for
resisting
an
officer
mr.
justice.
so
it
is
(inaudible)
to
the
case.
there
is
one
other
thing
why
this
is
so
important
to
me.
to
me,
it’s
the
most
important
part
of
the
case,
sir.
i
direct
this
especially
to
mr.
justice
douglas.
there
is
not
a
man
in
this
court
room,
mr.
justice
douglas,
who
is
more
concerned
personally
or
more
in
agreement
with
you
when
you
said
in
that
1951,
i
think
it’s
a
carignan
case,
that
is
the
time
audit
system
of
the
police
to
arrest
a
man
for
vagrancy,
or
for
a
lesser
charge,
so
they
could
investigate
a
greater
charge.
there
is
no
community
in
the
nation
who
agrees
more
with
that,
that
it’s
a
wrong
practice.
with
me
personally,
it’s
a
very
important
matter
because
there’s
a
lot
of
guilt
that
attaches.
i
was
running
the
--
well
the
complaint
desk
for
mr.
leon
hubert
between
1954
and
1956.
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
prior
to
1957,
we
charged
everybody
with
107
vagrancy
pending
investigation
of
everything
from
murder
to
rape,
to
incest,
to
petty
larceny
but
the
difference,
it
has
not
been
done
since
1957.
i
have
made
part
of
my
response
brief,
an
actual
copy
of
the
order
put
out
by
the
police
in
1957.
mr.
hubert
and
i
were
instrumental
in
doing
this.
we
searched
it
out.
we
realized
we
were
wrong.
we
saw
the
error
of
our
ways.
and
so
we
came
in
with
this
order,
police
order,
which
says
effective
in
august
of
1957.
there
will
be
no
more
arrests
on
vagrancy
pending
investigation
of
anything.
and
when
you
take
the
charge
of
vagrancy,
it
must
stand
on
its
own
feet.
and
what
did
we
do
in
this
case?
the
thing
that
might
be
overlooked
in
this
matter,
since
i
was
part
and
parcel
of
this
bad
system,
if
we
charge
a
man
with
107,
pending
investigation
of
murder,
armed
robbery,
burglary,
what
not,
if
he
were
cleared
on
the
burglary
charge,
the
armed
robbery,
the
107
went
out
the
window,
we
threw
out
the
vagrancy
charge.
that
did
not
happen
in
this
case.
mr.
wainwright
was
cleared
as
a
suspect
in
this
murder
the
very
morning
of
his
arrest.
and
yet
the
city
persisted
in
prosecuting
him
on
vagrancy.
the
city
persisted
in
going
to
that
one
resisting
an
arrest
--
resisting
an
officer?
these
were
not
holding
charges.
as
long
as
i
am
in
the
city
of
new
orleans,
nobody
will
ever
again
take
a
lesser
charge
for
purposes
of
pending
investigation
of
a
greater
charge
without
running
into
a
fight
with
me.
as
mr.
hubert
and
i,
jim
garrison
he
was
part
of
that
office,
just
beginning.
we
all
knew
this
was
wrong.
and
when
we
realize
the
error
of
our
ways,
we
did
away
with
it.
it
was
not
done
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
and
i
want
to
assure
you
that
it
was
not
done
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
alright
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
well,
one
thing
when
the
police
passed
by
and
saw
him
resemble
a
suspect
in
murder
of
johnny
mctailor
whom
we
were
looking
for,
they
stopped
their
car,
backed
up
and
went
to
talk
to
him.
civil
liberties
people
make
a
lot
out
of
the
fact
that
he
was
only
observed
for
five
seconds.
there
is
no
controversy
on
that
evidence.
the
police
said
we
were
passing
by.
we
saw
this
man
he
was
standing
there.
they
don’t
know
whether
he
was
standing
there
for
an
hour
or
five
seconds.
they
saw
him
for
five
seconds
before
they
went
over
to
talk
to
him.
now,
when
they
went
to
talk
to
him,
they
told
him
about
the
tattoo,
etcetera.
and
even
then,
this
is
important.
had
he
had
a
tattoo
on
his
arm,
it
would
not
have
been
incriminating.
murders
are
not
committed
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
all
right,
sir
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
all
right,
the
act
of
vagrancy
was
he’d
looked
like
a
vagrant.
he
acted
like
a
vagrant.
his
demeanor
was
that
of
a
vagrant.
he
had
no
identification
on
him.
he
said
he
was
going
to
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
well,
shabby
clothes.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes
sir,
he
look
like
a
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
this
was
not
around
a
university,
mr.
justice.
this
was
down
the
french
quarter
mr.
richard
c.
seither
well
mr.
justice,
we’re
not
pegging
this
vagrancy
charge
strictly
on
shabby
clothes.
it’s
the
overall
picture.
(voice
overlap)
shabby
clothes,
he
had
no
identification
on
him.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
that’s
important
too.
it
was
contended
yesterday
that
he
freely
gave
his
name.
he
very
reluctantly
gave
his
name
from
the
minute
they
approached
him.
he
was
very
belligerent
and
uncooperative.
they
asked
him
three
times.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
it
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
would
think
so,
your
honor.
it
contributes
to
all
part
of
the
picture.
he
was
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
don’t
know
if
it
applies
of
vagrancy,
i
know
we
cited
the
3141
case
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
he
had
no
identification
on
it.
he
had
no

mr.
richard
c.
seither
your
honor,
please,
every
fellow
that
have
arrested
without
identification
and
most
of
them
don’t
carry
it
around.
they
were
deliberately
say,
“if
you
take
me
somewhere,
i
can
get
my
identification.”
and
the
police
refused
to
do
it.
they
have
orders
not
to
do
it.
their
expression
is,
“if
i
take
them
there,
we
might
be
walking
into
the
mouth
of
a
cannon.”
further,
he
had
no
draft
card
on
him.
the
man
we
were
looking
for
was
8wol
from
the
armed
services
mr.
johnny
mctailor,
the
man
whom
he
would
show
on
the
composite
picture
of
him,
said
you
resemble.
he
said
he
was
going
to
eat
yet
he
had
scarce
funds
on
him.
the
police
told
me
he
didn’t
have
enough
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
don’t
know
your
honor.
i’m
only
saying
what
the
police
told
me
that
he
didn’t
have
enough
to
eat
on.
he
had
no
identification,
no
draft
card
there
was
of
draft
age.
his
attitude,
all
this
put
together
would
make
out
of
good
case
of
vagrancy.
and
again,
though
you
say
this
is
digressing
from
vagrancy,
i
mean
to
say
put
the
whole
the
picture
together
and
the
actions
of
mr.
wainwright
will
precisely
the
actions
that
you
would
have
expected
of
a
man
who
was
wanted
for
something.
now
as
regards
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir.
because
at
that
stage,
he
hadn’t
been
investigated.
he
hadn’t
--
it
hadn’t
gone
that
far
yet.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes?
i
make
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
if
he
had
shown
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
well
your
honor,
i’m
trying
to
answer,
if
he
had
shown
his
arm,
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
arresting
officers,
the
matter
would
have
ended
summarily.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes,
but
dropped
everything,
it
would
drop
all
the
(voice
overlap).
sir?
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
misunderstood
your
question.
the
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
and
for
resisting
an
officer.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
oh
no.
he
had
already
been
arrested
for
those
and
approved
it.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
positively
and
we
would
have
take
him
into
court
and
approve
it.
that’s
precisely
what
we
did,
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
he
was
cleared
that
very
morning
of
any
link
with
the
murder
case
and
yet
we
persisted.
we
took
him
to
trial
on
vagrancy
and
resisting
an
officer.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
for
what?
we
would
have
let
him
go
--
and
when
you
say
at
the
very
end,
at
the
very
end
of
what?
before
he
was
placed
under
arrest?
mr.
richard
c.
seither
oh
no.
once
he
was
placed
under
arrest
for
resisting
an
officer
and
for
vagrancy,
the
city
had
every
intention
of
persisting
in
that
and
they
did
persist
in
it.
that
is
my
point,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
purpose
in
stopping
him
was
to
see
if
he
were
the
johnny
mctailor
who
was
wanted
for
murder.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
as
the
judge
found
in
the
criminal
district
court,
if
at
that
point
he
had
just
said,
“this
is
my
left
forearm
(voice
overlap)”,
go
on
about
your
business.
but
once
they
had
--
sir?
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
think
this
is
the
answer
that
you
seek,
mr.
justice.
had
he
shown
his
right
arm?
as
soon
as
they
said,
“look
man,
we
don’t
want
to
arrest
you.
we
got
a
picture
here,
you
are
--
we
got
to
out,
perfect
out.
the
man
we
are
searching
for
has
a
tattoo
upon
the
(inaudible)
on
his
left
arm.
would
you
remove
your
jacket
and
let
us
see
your
left
arm?”
he
didn’t
remove
his
jacket.
he
refused
to
do
it.
so
they
went
on
investigating
for
another
four
minutes.
it
was
not
as
he
said,
“our
stop
is
a
suspect
for
murder
and
put
vagrancy
at
you.”
it
was
then
after
four
or
five-minute
interrogation
that
he
was
charged
with
resisting
an
officer
and
with
vagrancy.
now
if
at
any
time
before
he
was
booked,
i
mean
charged,
arrested
for
vagrancy
or
for
resisting
an
officer,
he
had
shown
his
arm,
the
matter
is
over.
once
he
was
arrested
for
resisting
an
officer
and
for
vagrancy,
the
matter
wouldn’t
have
ended
no
matter
what
he
did
because
we
did
find
out
(voice
overlap)
–
mr.
richard
c.
seither
not
too
many.
this
was
1963.
this
was
before
the
hippies
had
invaded
new
orleans
or
(inaudible)
or
whatever
the
mold
of
the
moment
is,
long
before
that.
he
was
not
stopped
because
of
his
attire,
primarily
he
was
stopped
because
he
resembled
this
man
wanted
in
murder.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i’m
saying
putting
the
whole
thing
together,
mr.
justice
made
out
of
case
of
vagrancy.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
they
positively
would
not
have
charged
him
with
vagrancy.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
on
that
particular
set
of
facts
alone
mr.
justice,
i
submit
he
would
not
under
any
circumstances
have
been
charged
of
vagrancy
because
he
had
identification
and
it
was
his
action
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
the
next
thing
they
do,
if
he
walked
away
from
the
investigation
and
booked
him
as
they
did
resisting
an
officer.
and
thirdly
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
all
right.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
then
squarely
right
down
at
the
point
about
the
murder,
they
could
have
arrested
him
as
a
suspect
in
murder.
i
say.
now
this
is
not
arrest
on
suspicion.
it
is
not
suspicion
alone
if
they
wanted
to
arrest
this
man
on
suspicion
alone.
as
soon
as
they
saw
it,
they
got
out
of
the
car
and
say,
“hey,
you
look
like
this
murderer.
we
arrest
you
for
murder.”
but
they
didn’t
do
that.
(voice
overlap)
--and
when
he
refused
mr.
fortas,
nothing
happened.
it’s
not
just
a
hypothetical
case.
this
is
precisely
what
happened
here.
when
this
man
refused
to
bare
his
left
forearm,
they
did
not
summarily
arrest
him
and
put
him
in
jail.
they
then
continued
to
interrogate
him.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i’m
sorry.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
how
much
what
--
i
didn’t
hear
to
how
much
and
made
him
what
sir?
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir.
that
is
what
i
want
to
stress
your
honor
please.
we
don’t
do
that
in
new
orleans
because
that
would
amount
to
vagrancy
pending
investigation.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
appreciate
the
question,
your
honor.
and
we
say
that
was
not
done.
we
say
it
was
done
because
he
was
charged
of
resisting
an
officer,
for
walking
away
three
times.
we
tried
to
make
out
a
guess
at
the
composite
picture
made
out
of
case
of
vagrancy.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
not,
this
is
the
one
thing
that's
most
important
to
us.
if
we
charge
him
with
vagrancy
under
the
circumstances
that
presented
here
today,
then
i
couldn't
face
you
and
say
it,
we
are
not
charging
people
with
vagrancy
pending
investigation
or
something
because
that's
precisely
what
would
have
had
happened.
but
in
this
case,
we
persisted
in
the
charge.
now
the
one
important
thing
in
the
old
days
when
we
did
this
wrongly,
as
soon
as
the
man
was
cleared
as
a
murder
suspect,
the
vagrancy
went
out
the
window.
that
didn't
happen
here.
we
thought
we
had
a
good
concrete
charge
of
vagrancy.
we
took
it
to
court.
we
tried
it.
we
also
did
the
same
with
resisting
arrest,
of
resisting
an
officer
and
he
was
convicted.
and
the
judge
of
the
criminal
district
court,
our
appellate
court
even
reversed
this
on
resisting
an
officer
but
does
he
fell
for
the
argument
that
it
was
resisting
arrest,
and
had
he
been
not
placed
under
arrest
first
for
vagrancy.
then
how
could
you
resist
an
arrest
that
wasn't
first
made.
and
so
it
looked
very
strong
for
american
civil
liberties
union
when
they
brought
out
in
the
testimony,
in
this
court
i'm
talking
about,
your
honor
please.
the
second
time,
the
second
go
around
of
officer
beopple,
when
they
said,
“which
did
you
do
first?”
he
said,
“i
did
all
three
simultaneously.”
so
this
is
very
strong
to
defeat
the
resisting
arrest
article
because
if
he
had
not
been
arrested
first
for
vagrancy,
then
how
can
he
resist
an
arrest
that
had
not
been
made
yet.
and
so
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
it's
general
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i've
cited
that,
mr.
justice,
the
astriago
(ph)
case,
new
york
case
which
is
in
the
brief
from
which
the
judge
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
and
i
don't
think
that
happened
here.
he
was
not
arrested
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
for
refusing
to
reveal
his
arms.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
it's
resisting
an
officer
if
the
first
time
he
walks
off,
they
step
in
front
of
him
and
stop
him
and
say,
“we're
investigating
you.
we
want
to
inquire
in
to
this
matter.
don't
walk
off
anymore.”
and
he
walked
off
twice
subsequently.
if
he
can
do
this,
then
police
power
in
the
nation
is
gone.
the
person
being
interrogated
can
decide,
as
this
man
did
unilaterally
--
what
the
police
can
investigate,
what
they
can't,
what
they
can
do,
and
i
believe
that
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
believe
your
honor
preference
for
all
this
by
saying
hypothetical
case
that
there
was
no
probable
cause.
we
think
there
was
a
probable
cause.
but
that
i
suggest
your
honor
that
the
astriago
(ph)
case
in
new
york
held
that
suspicious
and
(inaudible)
conduct
is
sufficient
grounds
for
making
an
arrest
and
that
is
besides
--
sir?
mr.
richard
c.
seither
that
said
to
arrest
the
felon
and
the
man
we
were
seeking
out
was
a
man
suspected
of
committing
murder
in
the
community.
incidentally
your
honor,
this
is
significant
i
believe,
we've
since
arrested
and
cleared
everybody
in
this
case.
we've
arrested
15,
20
people
perhaps.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir.
none
of
them
were
put
to
vagrancy
for
pending
investigation
of
anything.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir.
the
police
requested
him
to
take
it
off
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes,
not
for
vagrancy.
your
honor,
we
keep
bringing
back
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
mr.
justice,
he
wasn't
arrested.
he
wasn't
arrested
for
a
straight
charge
of
vagrancy.
that
man
was
arrested
simultaneously
just
as
much
for
walking
away
from
the
scene.
that
is
what
he
was
arrested
for.
we
thought
we
had
a
good
vagrancy
charge.
there
is
no
conflict
between
being
a
murderer
and
a
vagrant
because
vagrancy
had
been
known
to
commit
murder
and
murders
had
been
known
to
be
vagrancy.
the
only
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
it
was
good.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir.
he
was
convicted
originally
for
resisting
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
present
conviction
is
for
butting
people
around
the
wall.
and
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
that's
what
i
think,
except
that
they've
got
the
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
because
i
was
asking
the
questions
your
honor.
i
didn't
want
to
even
go
into
that.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir.
i
have
--
i
was
forced
into
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
why
don't
they
work?
mr.
richard
c.
seither
that's
precisely
our
case.
that
all
the
other
things
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact
that
he
stands
convicted
up
here.
i
wrote
in
brief
but
i
say
here,
the
only
thing
properly
before
the
court
in
the
city's
view
is
the
uncontroverted
evidence
that
this
man
butted
these
police
officers
from
wall
to
wall
and
say,
put
himself
down
like
a
full
bag
running
through
a
line
and
butted
these
men
from
wall
to
wall.
that
went
uncontroverted.
this
was
said
in
front
of
mr.
wainwright
in
the
court
of
law.
and
when
he
had
a
chance
to
controvert,
he
took
the
stand.
i
know
if
it
would
be
fairly
defective
for
me
to
comment
on
his
refusal
to
take
the
stand
but
he
took
the
stand.
in
his
total
testimony,
it's
less
than
a
page,
with
them
making
all
these
statements
but
he
didn't
deny
anything.
that's
what
i
mean
when
i
say
it
went
un-controverted.
i
agree
mr.
justice
white
and
i
have
two
cases
that
i
wanted
to
cite
when
you
ask
me
too.
that
i
think
this
case
goes
off
on
the
whole
case
of
1910.
mr.
justice
marshall
raised
a
question
yesterday,
the
whole
case
which
was
reasserted
in
schmerber
as
being
the
leading
case
in
the
considerations
in
schmerber.
they
had
made
this
man
model
of
glass.
and
since
then,
i
think
it
has
been
held
repeatedly
through
the
years.
i'd
like
to
jeopardize
the
whole
cases
where
an
exploratory
search
of
the
body
--
if
you
want
to
use
the
word
search,
is
permissible.
certainly,
if
we
could
have
a
bloodletting,
mr.
justice
douglas
or
an
intrusion
into
the
bloodstream
to
get
evidence
against
a
person,
we
can
certainly
ask
him
to
remove
his
jacket
for
all
purpose
of
search.
but
the
city
contends
there
was
never
any
search
made
here.
when
this
man
refused
to
take
off
his
jacket,
we
did
not
arrest
him.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
don't
know,
put
on
the
testimony
and
convict
him
at
what
happened
in
the
street?
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
when
i
said
it
was
irrelevant
to
the
case,
i've
got
to
mr.
justice
white's
position
that
the
only
thing
properly
before
this
court
now
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
thought
you'd
ask
me
if
that
wasn't
the
main
point
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
alright.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
the
city
said
in
brief
that
it's
irrelevant
but
the
city
is
willing
to
meet
the
issues
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
alright,
and
i
say
it
is
not.
and
i
say
for
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
it
is
not
relevant
for
these
reasons.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
it
was
raised
by
civil
liberties
and
my
position
in
the
case
was
to
answer.
i
didn't
bring
it
up
here
first
today.
i
was
asked
these
questions,
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
because
he
was
tried
in
these
matters
on
the
street
for
what
happened
on
the
street.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
but
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
he
was
convicted
only
at
the
street
level
of
resisting
an
officer.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
at
the
request
of
the
justices
up
here.
(voice

mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
don't
quite
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes,
as
i
have.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes,
your
honor.
and
that's
strong
(voice

--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
where
i
said
it
was
irrelevant,
your
honor
please.
i
thought
we
were
in
the
area
of
search.
in
my
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
question.
no
question,
the
arrest
was
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes
sir.
i
have
here
a
complete
pbi
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir.
there's
one,
it
was
--
yes,
there
was
a
picture
of
the
same
one
that's
here
that
was
introduced
as
exhibit
a.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
don't
know
sir.
i
do
know
that
it
was
offered
in
evidence
as
exhibit
a.
i
do
have
it
here
if
you
want
me
to
put
it
into
the
record.
and
you
see
it
originally
mr.
justice,
i
didn't
--
i'll
put
the
whole
thing
if
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir,
it
is
not
my
position
in
that.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we've
just
adopted
mr.
(inaudible)
has
just
drawn
up
a
stop
and
frisk
law
which
we
say,
we
have
a
right
to
stop
a
man
and
ask
him
questions
but
his
refusal
to
answer
question
does
not
justify
his
arrest.
we
are
saying
that
he
was
not
arrested
for
his
refusal
to
answer
questions
or
his
refusal
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
that's
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
when
he
walked
away
from
the
interrogation
three
times
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
well,
and
i
answer
that
question
affirmatively,
your
honor.
i
believe
if
we
don't
have
--
that
we
do
have
the
right
to
question,
but
otherwise,
if
a
police
officer
wanted
to
stop
anybody
for
anything,
if
he
can
unilaterally
decide
what
he
can
away
from,
what
inquiries
he
see
can
stay
then
and
that
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
think
so.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
well
then
we're
back
perhaps
to
henry.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
think
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
well
i
don't
know
either,
mr.
justice.
i
realized
that
i'm
not
speaking
up
here
adamantly;
i
realized
that
law
is
something
in
which
the
longer
we're
in
it,
the
lesser
we
speak
positively.
i
know,
i
don't
know.
i'm
only
trying
to
answer
the
question.
i
think
the
henry
case
could
be
invoked
that
he
was
under
arrest
at
the
moment
he
was
deprived
of
his
freedom
of
action.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
think
you
have
to
do
something
before
you
put
him
in
custody.
you
have
to
at
least
keep
him
from
walking
away.
otherwise,
he
could
never
be
put
onto
custody.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
then
he
doesn't
have
to.
if
we
ask
him
questions
and
he
doesn't
answer
them
satisfactorily,
then
under
the
law
of
stop
and
frisk
ordinance
which
we
just
passed,
that
is
no
basis
for
arresting
him
and
it
wasn't
done
in
this
case
alone.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
that's
right
sir.
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes,
we
could
have
arrested
him.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
we
can
arrest
the
man
for
things
other
than
the
answers
he
gives.
we
could
arrest
him
because
he
looked
just
like
the
man
we
wanted
in
murder
which
is
the
reason
we
did
it.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir.
and
there
was
nothing
done
with
him
until
he
was
put
in
the
custody
of
the
law.
when
he
refused
to
remove
his
jacket,
nothing
was
done.
it
was
at
the
station
house
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir.
and
we
didn't
do
it.
we
requested
him
to
remove
his
jacket.
when
he
refused,
nothing
happened.
that
is
our
point
and
when
he
got
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
sir?
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no,
but
even
after
he
was
placed
in
custody
on
the
street,
when
we
charged
him
with
resisting
an
officer
and
vagrancy,
we
still
didn't
make
him
do
it.
we
never
did
order
him
to
do
anything
until
we've
got
to
the
precinct
station.
and
there,
nothing
was
done
for
some
15
minutes.
they
called
the
lieutenant.
they
said,
“we
know
how
to
handle
this.”
lieutenant
explained
to
him
before
we
can
--
of
course
we
think
legally
the
whole
case,
would
say
if
you
can
examine
a
person
in
exploratory
search
of
the
body
for
identifying
marks.
the
whole
case
says
this,
astriago
(ph)
says
it
but
to
answer
your
question
mr.
justice,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
was
not
ordered
to
take
off
anything
at
the
bourbon
street
scene.
he
was
requested
and
when
it
refused,
nothing
happened.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
because
it
was
reversed
at
the
district
court
level.
but
the
butting
of
the
police
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i'd
say
that
by
way
of
argument.
however,
when
(voice

--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
precisely
mr,
justice.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
see
the
case
precisely
as
you
stated,
your
honor
and
i'd
say
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
was
asked
to
answer
about
vagrancy
and
arrest.
i
just
said
it
wasn't
as
a
holding
charge
but
i
would
say
this,
the
only
two
matters
before
this
court
are
the
convictions
on
assaulting
an
officer,
two
officers.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i've
said
that
repeatedly
mr.
justice,
throughout
the
brief.
and
today
i
would
have
said
it
but
i
was
interrupted
to
go
into
the
vagrancy
by
means
of
pending
investigation.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
resisting
an
officer,
he
was
convicted
of
it
in
the
municipal
court
--
when
it
went
to
the
criminal
district
court,
i
meant
judge
thomas
brahney
reversed
resisting
an
officer
because
he
said
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
that
is
out.
and
so
the
only
matters
probably
before
this
court
in
the
view
of
the
city
are
the
convictions,
two
convictions
of
assaulting
two
police
officers
in
the
station.
and
that
testimony
went
un-controverted.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
one
charge
of
resisting
an
officer,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
that's
been
reversed,
that's
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir,
no
sir,
resisting
an
officer
has
been
reversed.
vagrancy
has
never
been
--
we
put
on
the
trial
but
the
judge
has
never
decided.
he
took
an
under
advisement.
that
isn't
as
funny
as
it
may
appear.
mr.
wainwright
had
left
to
go
to
europe
for
a
year
and
we
certainly
are
not
going
--
once
the
case
came
up,
we
realized
that
this
man
was
a
responsible
citizen.
i
mean
he
got
a
25
appellate
suspended
sentence.
we
weren't
going
to
extradite
him
from
europe
to
try
him
for
a
vagrancy
charge.
but
the
whole
thing
is
in
there
if
we
did
take
him
to
bat
on
it,
the
matter
was
interrupted
and
continued
and
the
judge
never
did
depend
on
a
file
and
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
did
i
say
that?
mr.
richard
c.
seither
sir,
i
didn't
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
it's
precisely
right.
it
happens
--
it
happens
everyday
and
we
have
cases
where
--
we
have
cases
where
we
find
people
dead
on
a
dump
that
leave
on
it
in
25,000
in
the
garbage
can
but
their
life,
their
mode
of
living
was
out
of
for
vagrancy.
so
the
amount
of
money

mr.
richard

and
that
states
it
is
relative
to
the
statement
of
peace
and
assault,
and
then
the
vagrancy
matter
is
--
mr.

your

mr.
richard

seither
that's
one
of
the
matters.

vagrancy
is
printed

mr.

well
by
complaint,
do
you
mean
the
original
police
report?
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes,
that's
all.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes
sir.
mr.
richard

seither
i
have
the
original
here
of
those
records
if
your
honor
wants
them
and
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes,
he
was
tried
on
an
affidavit
and
the
affidavit
stated
--
disturbing
the
peace
by
assault
on
officer
frank
o'rourke
and
such
and
such
of
place
and
time.
and
the
other
affidavit
reads,
disturbing
a
peace
by
assault
on
officer,
i
think
addison.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes,
your
honor
please,
that's
the
city's
position.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
thank
you.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
seither,
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
the
view
of
the
city
of
new
orleans
that
the
matters,
enlarged
matters
that
the
court
has
asked
the
city
here
today
on
the
fourth,
fifth
and
sixth
amendments.
and
we
will
try
to
eliminate
any
consideration
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
summarily.
now,
it
is
significant
in
the
city’s
view
that
enlisting
authorities,
the
american
civil
liberties
union
which
submitted
an
outstanding
brief,
professional
brief
obviously
written
by
professional
lawyers
in
a
professional
manner,
listed
the
fourth
and
sixth
amendment
and
did
not
cite
in
its
list
of
authorities
of
fifth
amendment.
i
am
asking
this
court
to
consider
the
fifth
amendment
in
this
case
only
bring
it
into
the
case
only
for
consideration.
it
is
important
because
the
wainwright
forces
cite
miranda,
escobedo,
gideon
versus
wainwright.
i’ll
take
those
three
cases.
first,
gideon
versus
wainwright,
the
sixth
amendment,
this
is
not
that
type
of
sixth
amendment
case.
there
is
no
question
that
mr.
wainwright
was
represented
at
all
times
by
counsel
in
the
court
room.
so
let’s
look
at
escobedo
and
miranda.
there
is
no
question,
there
are
no
confessions
here
to
suppress,
no
admissions,
no
statements
of
anytime.
so
if
then
we
cite
escobedo
and
miranda
just
in
reference
to
the
sixth
amendment,
leave
out
the
fifth
amendment
considerations
of
escobedo
and
miranda,
we’re
only
citing
half
of
the
case.
escobedo
and
miranda
primarily
stands
we
submit
for
the
introduction
of
confessions
unlawfully
obtained
and
this
court
has
held.
correctly
we
think
that
a
denial
of
counsel
at
the
time
when
statements
are
made,
would
then
rule
out
on
the
miranda
and
on
the
escobedo
any
incriminatory
statements.
we
bring
the
fifth
amendment
into
this
case
to
say
there
are
no
incriminatory
statements.
there
never
were
any
statements.
there
never
were
any
confessions
entered
into
this
case.
so
gideon
versus
wainwright,
escobedo
and
miranda
go
out
of
the
case.
and
we’ve
met
this
issue
head
on.
we
don’t
want
to
cite
the
effective
date
of
escobedo
and
miranda.
we
wanted
to
meet
the
issues
of
escobedo
and
miranda,
if
your
honors
please.
now
let’s
go
to
the
fourth
amendment.
the
fourth
amendment,
all
cases
cited
have
to
do
with
the
suppression
of
illegally
obtained
evidence.
there
is
no
illegally
obtained
evidence.
there
is
no
evidence,
physical,
real,
and
any
other
kind
of
evidence
in
this
case
for
the
court
to
suppress.
there
was
never
any
offered
that
could
not
have
been
any
offered.
there
was
never
any
sought.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
that
a
man
was
found
murdered
on
october
3,
1963
or
rather
he
was
--
the
date
of
the
murder
was
fixed
at
october
3rd,
but
his
body
was
not
found
until
october
6,
1963.
mr.
wainwright
was
not
arrested
until
october
13,
1963.
mr.
wainwright
was
arrested
because
he
thrice
walked
away
from
investigating
officers
who
told
him
not
to
do
it
after
he
tried
to
do
it
the
first
time.
they
told
him
specifically.
they
were
in
the
course
of
investigating
a
murder.
they
told
him.
they
showed
him.
came
out
a
composite
picture
from
the
murder,
they
said,
“you
resemble
this
man.
all
we
want
to
do
is
question
you
in
relation
to
this
case.
and
when
we
ask,
we
don’t
want
to
arrest
you.”
they
even
told
them
that.
“we
have
a
perfect
out
for
you.
the
man
we
are
seeking
has
a
tattoo
on
his
left
forearm,
on
to
raise
hell.
bare
your
left
forearm
and
go
on
about
your
business
if
you
don’t
have
this
tattoo
on
your
left
forearm.”
now,
there
is
no
doubt
when
i
say
bare
your
left
forearm,
they
didn’t
just
ask
him
to
do
this,
although
there
were
some
people
who
believe,
the
testimony
has
a
little
shake
on
it.
there’s
no
question.
they
did
ask
him
to
remove
his
jacket,
for
all
purposes
of
observing
this
left
forearm.
at
no
time
was
he
ordered
to
remove
his
jacket.
i
say
this
especially
in
answer
to
your
question
yesterday,
mr.
justice
white.
if
this
man
was
charged
with
resisting
arrest
and
he
was,
under
no
time,
i
mean
resisting
an
officer,
never
was
he
charged
with
resisting
arrest.
and
it
is
a
very
important
distinction
here
that
we
must
draw.
but
at
no
time
was
he
arrested
for
resisting
an
officer
in
a
sense
that
he
resisted
an
order
of
the
officers
to
take
off
his
jacket.
he
was
never
ordered
to
take
off
his
jacket
at
the
bourbon
street
scene,
the
arrest
scene.
he
was
requested
to
remove
his
jacket
so
they
could
look
at
his
left
forearm
to
see
if
he
had
a
tattoo.
and
if
he
didn’t
have
a
tattoo,
he
could
go
on
abide
his
business.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
think
it’s
crucial,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
in
the
sense
that
had
he
been
ordered
to
remove
his
jacket
and
refused,
then
he
could
have
conceivably
been
arrested
for
resisting
an
officer.
by
resisting
an
officer’s
order
which
i
believe
is
a
point
mr.
white
raised
yesterday.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
the
police
were
trying
to.
the
whole
testimony
reads
to
that.
the
police,
i
have
the
actual
testimony
if
you
want
me
to
read.
it’s
in
the
record.
it’s
in
the
transcript
of
the
case
and
at
this
point
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
not
because
he
failed
to
bare
his
jacket.
that
is
a
crucial
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
we
passed
from
a
point
of
doing
him
a
favor
when
he
deliberately
walked
away
thrice,
three
times
from
the
officers
when
they
were
investigating.
it
is
most
important
to
this
case.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir
that
is
precisely
the
point,
mr.
justice
marshall
that
i
want
to
stress
in
this
case.
i
believe
that
the
wainwright
forces
have
been
trying
to
establish
and
i
don’t
blame
them.
if
i
were
on
the
defense
side,
i’d
be
doing
it
too.
that
he
was
first
arrested
fro
vagrancy.
mr.

no

no
mr.
justice
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
mr.
justice
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
he
has
said
it
but
it’s
not
so.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
well
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
even
the
civil
liberty
speech
is
in
this
document.
there
is
no
question
in
the
blue
book,
it’s
here,
b168,

your
honors,
please
i
direct
your
attention
to
page
148
in
this
blue
book
which
is
the
response
brief
of
the
city
of
new
orleans.
at
page
148,
defense
counsel
mr.
spencer
asked
the
officer,
the
first
charge
against
him
was
what?
all
three
were
put
on
at
the
same
time.
what
did
you
arrest
him
for
first?
answer,
vagrancy
violating,
and
resisting
an
officer.
those
are
together.
at
what
point
did
you
charge
him
with
resisting
an
officer?
the
charges
were
all
brought
at
the
station.
you
arrested
him
on
bourbon
street?
what
did
you
arrest
him
for?
answer,
resisting
an
officer
and
vagrancy
by
loitering.
how
did
he
resist
you
on
bourbon
street?
by
attempting
to
walk
off.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
boepple?
i
believe
it
was
boepple
that
i
was
saying.
that
is
officer
boepple.
your
honor,
please
what
i
was
citing.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
can
reconcile,
your
honor
please
by
reading
what
i
just
read
from
the
same
officer
under
different
circumstances.
i
believe
a
close
reading
of
that
will
reveal
a
tremendous
amount
of
testifying
by
the
defense
attorney
who
is
putting
words
in
his
mouth.
when
this
man
was
(voice

--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir,
i
don’t
think
so.
that’s
my
objection
to
it.
i
do
know
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
sir?
mr.
richard
c.
seither
certainly.
certainly
we’d
do
that
everyday.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
he’s
asking
leading
questions
but
he’s
putting
into
his
mouth
words
that
he
arrested
him
first
for
vagrancy,
because
here,
he
said
which
charge?
the
first
charge
against
him
was
what?
he
said
all
three
were
put
on
at
the
same
time.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
at
148
he
says,
your
honor,
that
it’s
the
same
man.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir,
your
honor,
please
it’s
the
same
man
testifying
under
different
conditions
of
the
same
set
of
facts.
and
all
the
way
through,
all
the
way
through,
the
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
didn’t
mean
to
argue,
your
honor
please
i’m
just
citing
(voice
overlap)
even
the
civil
liberties,
you
need
in
there
splendid
brief
said
that
the
matter,
it’s
undetermined
as
to
which
he
was
arrested
for
first.
now,
that’s
in
the
brief
that
was
submitted
by
civil
liberties
union.
now
it
is
my
position
that
there
is
no
question
that
the
trial
lawyer
was
trying
to
make
out
a
case
of
--
you
mean
you’ve
had
an
arrest
to
this
man
for
vagrancy
first
and
now
you
charge
him
with
resisting
an
arrest
that
had
not
been
made
yet?
and
when
the
police
officer
said
that
it
was
close,
we
don’t
know
which
came
first.
we
arrest
him
all
three
simultaneously,
it
looked
at
that
point
as
a
very
strong
position
for
mr.
wainwright
because
throughout
this
the
early
proceedings
of
this
case,
they
persisted
in
calling
this
a
charge
of
resisting
arrest.
and
the
city
has
shown,
and
will
show
and
that
record
shows,
and
the
exact
transcript
for
this,
the
man
was
charged
with
resisting
an
officer.
he
was
arraigned
for
resisting
an
officer.
the
original
affidavit
which
is
in
the
record
is
on
resisting
an
officer.
he
was
tried
for
resisting
an
officer
mr.
justice.
so
it
is
(inaudible)
to
the
case.
there
is
one
other
thing
why
this
is
so
important
to
me.
to
me,
it’s
the
most
important
part
of
the
case,
sir.
i
direct
this
especially
to
mr.
justice
douglas.
there
is
not
a
man
in
this
court
room,
mr.
justice
douglas,
who
is
more
concerned
personally
or
more
in
agreement
with
you
when
you
said
in
that
1951,
i
think
it’s
a
carignan
case,
that
is
the
time
audit
system
of
the
police
to
arrest
a
man
for
vagrancy,
or
for
a
lesser
charge,
so
they
could
investigate
a
greater
charge.
there
is
no
community
in
the
nation
who
agrees
more
with
that,
that
it’s
a
wrong
practice.
with
me
personally,
it’s
a
very
important
matter
because
there’s
a
lot
of
guilt
that
attaches.
i
was
running
the
--
well
the
complaint
desk
for
mr.
leon
hubert
between
1954
and
1956.
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
prior
to
1957,
we
charged
everybody
with
107
vagrancy
pending
investigation
of
everything
from
murder
to
rape,
to
incest,
to
petty
larceny
but
the
difference,
it
has
not
been
done
since
1957.
i
have
made
part
of
my
response
brief,
an
actual
copy
of
the
order
put
out
by
the
police
in
1957.
mr.
hubert
and
i
were
instrumental
in
doing
this.
we
searched
it
out.
we
realized
we
were
wrong.
we
saw
the
error
of
our
ways.
and
so
we
came
in
with
this
order,
police
order,
which
says
effective
in
august
of
1957.
there
will
be
no
more
arrests
on
vagrancy
pending
investigation
of
anything.
and
when
you
take
the
charge
of
vagrancy,
it
must
stand
on
its
own
feet.
and
what
did
we
do
in
this
case?
the
thing
that
might
be
overlooked
in
this
matter,
since
i
was
part
and
parcel
of
this
bad
system,
if
we
charge
a
man
with
107,
pending
investigation
of
murder,
armed
robbery,
burglary,
what
not,
if
he
were
cleared
on
the
burglary
charge,
the
armed
robbery,
the
107
went
out
the
window,
we
threw
out
the
vagrancy
charge.
that
did
not
happen
in
this
case.
mr.
wainwright
was
cleared
as
a
suspect
in
this
murder
the
very
morning
of
his
arrest.
and
yet
the
city
persisted
in
prosecuting
him
on
vagrancy.
the
city
persisted
in
going
to
that
one
resisting
an
arrest
--
resisting
an
officer?
these
were
not
holding
charges.
as
long
as
i
am
in
the
city
of
new
orleans,
nobody
will
ever
again
take
a
lesser
charge
for
purposes
of
pending
investigation
of
a
greater
charge
without
running
into
a
fight
with
me.
as
mr.
hubert
and
i,
jim
garrison
he
was
part
of
that
office,
just
beginning.
we
all
knew
this
was
wrong.
and
when
we
realize
the
error
of
our
ways,
we
did
away
with
it.
it
was
not
done
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
and
i
want
to
assure
you
that
it
was
not
done
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
alright
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
well,
one
thing
when
the
police
passed
by
and
saw
him
resemble
a
suspect
in
murder
of
johnny
mctailor
whom
we
were
looking
for,
they
stopped
their
car,
backed
up
and
went
to
talk
to
him.
civil
liberties
people
make
a
lot
out
of
the
fact
that
he
was
only
observed
for
five
seconds.
there
is
no
controversy
on
that
evidence.
the
police
said
we
were
passing
by.
we
saw
this
man
he
was
standing
there.
they
don’t
know
whether
he
was
standing
there
for
an
hour
or
five
seconds.
they
saw
him
for
five
seconds
before
they
went
over
to
talk
to
him.
now,
when
they
went
to
talk
to
him,
they
told
him
about
the
tattoo,
etcetera.
and
even
then,
this
is
important.
had
he
had
a
tattoo
on
his
arm,
it
would
not
have
been
incriminating.
murders
are
not
committed
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
all
right,
sir
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
all
right,
the
act
of
vagrancy
was
he’d
looked
like
a
vagrant.
he
acted
like
a
vagrant.
his
demeanor
was
that
of
a
vagrant.
he
had
no
identification
on
him.
he
said
he
was
going
to
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
well,
shabby
clothes.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes
sir,
he
look
like
a
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
this
was
not
around
a
university,
mr.
justice.
this
was
down
the
french
quarter
mr.
richard
c.
seither
well
mr.
justice,
we’re
not
pegging
this
vagrancy
charge
strictly
on
shabby
clothes.
it’s
the
overall
picture.
(voice
overlap)
shabby
clothes,
he
had
no
identification
on
him.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
that’s
important
too.
it
was
contended
yesterday
that
he
freely
gave
his
name.
he
very
reluctantly
gave
his
name
from
the
minute
they
approached
him.
he
was
very
belligerent
and
uncooperative.
they
asked
him
three
times.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
it
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
would
think
so,
your
honor.
it
contributes
to
all
part
of
the
picture.
he
was
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
don’t
know
if
it
applies
of
vagrancy,
i
know
we
cited
the
3141
case
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
he
had
no
identification
on
it.
he
had
no
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
your
honor,
please,
every
fellow
that
have
arrested
without
identification
and
most
of
them
don’t
carry
it
around.
they
were
deliberately
say,
“if
you
take
me
somewhere,
i
can
get
my
identification.”
and
the
police
refused
to
do
it.
they
have
orders
not
to
do
it.
their
expression
is,
“if
i
take
them
there,
we
might
be
walking
into
the
mouth
of
a
cannon.”
further,
he
had
no
draft
card
on
him.
the
man
we
were
looking
for
was
8wol
from
the
armed
services
mr.
johnny
mctailor,
the
man
whom
he
would
show
on
the
composite
picture
of
him,
said
you
resemble.
he
said
he
was
going
to
eat
yet
he
had
scarce
funds
on
him.
the
police
told
me
he
didn’t
have
enough
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
don’t
know
your
honor.
i’m
only
saying
what
the
police
told
me
that
he
didn’t
have
enough
to
eat
on.
he
had
no
identification,
no
draft
card
there
was
of
draft
age.
his
attitude,
all
this
put
together
would
make
out
of
good
case
of
vagrancy.
and
again,
though
you
say
this
is
digressing
from
vagrancy,
i
mean
to
say
put
the
whole
the
picture
together
and
the
actions
of
mr.
wainwright
will
precisely
the
actions
that
you
would
have
expected
of
a
man
who
was
wanted
for
something.
now
as
regards
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir.
because
at
that
stage,
he
hadn’t
been
investigated.
he
hadn’t
--
it
hadn’t
gone
that
far
yet.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes?
i
make
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
if
he
had
shown
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
well
your
honor,
i’m
trying
to
answer,
if
he
had
shown
his
arm,
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
arresting
officers,
the
matter
would
have
ended
summarily.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes,
but
dropped
everything,
it
would
drop
all
the
(voice
overlap).
sir?
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
misunderstood
your
question.
the
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
and
for
resisting
an
officer.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
oh
no.
he
had
already
been
arrested
for
those
and
approved
it.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
positively
and
we
would
have
take
him
into
court
and
approve
it.
that’s
precisely
what
we
did,
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
he
was
cleared
that
very
morning
of
any
link
with
the
murder
case
and
yet
we
persisted.
we
took
him
to
trial
on
vagrancy
and
resisting
an
officer.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
for
what?
we
would
have
let
him
go
--
and
when
you
say
at
the
very
end,
at
the
very
end
of
what?
before
he
was
placed
under
arrest?
mr.
richard
c.
seither
oh
no.
once
he
was
placed
under
arrest
for
resisting
an
officer
and
for
vagrancy,
the
city
had
every
intention
of
persisting
in
that
and
they
did
persist
in
it.
that
is
my
point,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
purpose
in
stopping
him
was
to
see
if
he
were
the
johnny
mctailor
who
was
wanted
for
murder.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
as
the
judge
found
in
the
criminal
district
court,
if
at
that
point
he
had
just
said,
“this
is
my
left
forearm
(voice
overlap)”,
go
on
about
your
business.
but
once
they
had
--
sir?
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
think
this
is
the
answer
that
you
seek,
mr.
justice.
had
he
shown
his
right
arm?
as
soon
as
they
said,
“look
man,
we
don’t
want
to
arrest
you.
we
got
a
picture
here,
you
are
--
we
got
to
out,
perfect
out.
the
man
we
are
searching
for
has
a
tattoo
upon
the
(inaudible)
on
his
left
arm.
would
you
remove
your
jacket
and
let
us
see
your
left
arm?”
he
didn’t
remove
his
jacket.
he
refused
to
do
it.
so
they
went
on
investigating
for
another
four
minutes.
it
was
not
as
he
said,
“our
stop
is
a
suspect
for
murder
and
put
vagrancy
at
you.”
it
was
then
after
four
or
five-minute
interrogation
that
he
was
charged
with
resisting
an
officer
and
with
vagrancy.
now
if
at
any
time
before
he
was
booked,
i
mean
charged,
arrested
for
vagrancy
or
for
resisting
an
officer,
he
had
shown
his
arm,
the
matter
is
over.
once
he
was
arrested
for
resisting
an
officer
and
for
vagrancy,
the
matter
wouldn’t
have
ended
no
matter
what
he
did
because
we
did
find
out
(voice

–
mr.
richard
c.
seither
not
too
many.
this
was
1963.
this
was
before
the
hippies
had
invaded
new
orleans
or
(inaudible)
or
whatever
the
mold
of
the
moment
is,
long
before
that.
he
was
not
stopped
because
of
his
attire,
primarily
he
was
stopped
because
he
resembled
this
man
wanted
in
murder.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i’m
saying
putting
the
whole
thing
together,
mr.
justice
made
out
of
case
of
vagrancy.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
they
positively
would
not
have
charged
him
with
vagrancy.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
on
that
particular
set
of
facts
alone
mr.
justice,
i
submit
he
would
not
under
any
circumstances
have
been
charged
of
vagrancy
because
he
had
identification
and
it
was
his
action
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
the
next
thing
they
do,
if
he
walked
away
from
the
investigation
and
booked
him
as
they
did
resisting
an
officer.
and
thirdly
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
all
right.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
then
squarely
right
down
at
the
point
about
the
murder,
they
could
have
arrested
him
as
a
suspect
in
murder.
i
say.
now
this
is
not
arrest
on
suspicion.
it
is
not
suspicion
alone
if
they
wanted
to
arrest
this
man
on
suspicion
alone.
as
soon
as
they
saw
it,
they
got
out
of
the
car
and
say,
“hey,
you
look
like
this
murderer.
we
arrest
you
for
murder.”
but
they
didn’t
do
that.
(voice
overlap)
--and
when
he
refused
mr.
fortas,
nothing
happened.
it’s
not
just
a
hypothetical
case.
this
is
precisely
what
happened
here.
when
this
man
refused
to
bare
his
left
forearm,
they
did
not
summarily
arrest
him
and
put
him
in
jail.
they
then
continued
to
interrogate
him.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i’m
sorry.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
how
much
what
--
i
didn’t
hear
to
how
much
and
made
him
what
sir?
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir.
that
is
what
i
want
to
stress
your
honor
please.
we
don’t
do
that
in
new
orleans
because
that
would
amount
to
vagrancy
pending
investigation.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
appreciate
the
question,
your
honor.
and
we
say
that
was
not
done.
we
say
it
was
done
because
he
was
charged
of
resisting
an
officer,
for
walking
away
three
times.
we
tried
to
make
out
a
guess
at
the
composite
picture
made
out
of
case
of
vagrancy.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
not,
this
is
the
one
thing
that's
most
important
to
us.
if
we
charge
him
with
vagrancy
under
the
circumstances
that
presented
here
today,
then
i
couldn't
face
you
and
say
it,
we
are
not
charging
people
with
vagrancy
pending
investigation
or
something
because
that's
precisely
what
would
have
had
happened.
but
in
this
case,
we
persisted
in
the
charge.
now
the
one
important
thing
in
the
old
days
when
we
did
this
wrongly,
as
soon
as
the
man
was
cleared
as
a
murder
suspect,
the
vagrancy
went
out
the
window.
that
didn't
happen
here.
we
thought
we
had
a
good
concrete
charge
of
vagrancy.
we
took
it
to
court.
we
tried
it.
we
also
did
the
same
with
resisting
arrest,
of
resisting
an
officer
and
he
was
convicted.
and
the
judge
of
the
criminal
district
court,
our
appellate
court
even
reversed
this
on
resisting
an
officer
but
does
he
fell
for
the
argument
that
it
was
resisting
arrest,
and
had
he
been
not
placed
under
arrest
first
for
vagrancy.
then
how
could
you
resist
an
arrest
that
wasn't
first
made.
and
so
it
looked
very
strong
for
american
civil
liberties
union
when
they
brought
out
in
the
testimony,
in
this
court
i'm
talking
about,
your
honor
please.
the
second
time,
the
second
go
around
of
officer
beopple,
when
they
said,
“which
did
you
do
first?”
he
said,
“i
did
all
three
simultaneously.”
so
this
is
very
strong
to
defeat
the
resisting
arrest
article
because
if
he
had
not
been
arrested
first
for
vagrancy,
then
how
can
he
resist
an
arrest
that
had
not
been
made
yet.
and
so
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
it's
general
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i've
cited
that,
mr.
justice,
the
astriago
(ph)
case,
new
york
case
which
is
in
the
brief
from
which
the
judge
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
and
i
don't
think
that
happened
here.
he
was
not
arrested
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
for
refusing
to
reveal
his
arms.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
it's
resisting
an
officer
if
the
first
time
he
walks
off,
they
step
in
front
of
him
and
stop
him
and
say,
“we're
investigating
you.
we
want
to
inquire
in
to
this
matter.
don't
walk
off
anymore.”
and
he
walked
off
twice
subsequently.
if
he
can
do
this,
then
police
power
in
the
nation
is
gone.
the
person
being
interrogated
can
decide,
as
this
man
did
unilaterally
--
what
the
police
can
investigate,
what
they
can't,
what
they
can
do,
and
i
believe
that
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
believe
your
honor
preference
for
all
this
by
saying
hypothetical
case
that
there
was
no
probable
cause.
we
think
there
was
a
probable
cause.
but
that
i
suggest
your
honor
that
the
astriago
(ph)
case
in
new
york
held
that
suspicious
and
(inaudible)
conduct
is
sufficient
grounds
for
making
an
arrest
and
that
is
besides
--
sir?
mr.
richard
c.
seither
that
said
to
arrest
the
felon
and
the
man
we
were
seeking
out
was
a
man
suspected
of
committing
murder
in
the
community.
incidentally
your
honor,
this
is
significant
i
believe,
we've
since
arrested
and
cleared
everybody
in
this
case.
we've
arrested
15,
20
people
perhaps.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir.
none
of
them
were
put
to
vagrancy
for
pending
investigation
of
anything.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir.
the
police
requested
him
to
take
it
off
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes,
not
for
vagrancy.
your
honor,
we
keep
bringing
back
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
mr.
justice,
he
wasn't
arrested.
he
wasn't
arrested
for
a
straight
charge
of
vagrancy.
that
man
was
arrested
simultaneously
just
as
much
for
walking
away
from
the
scene.
that
is
what
he
was
arrested
for.
we
thought
we
had
a
good
vagrancy
charge.
there
is
no
conflict
between
being
a
murderer
and
a
vagrant
because
vagrancy
had
been
known
to
commit
murder
and
murders
had
been
known
to
be
vagrancy.
the
only
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
it
was
good.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir.
he
was
convicted
originally
for
resisting
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
present
conviction
is
for
butting
people
around
the
wall.
and
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
that's
what
i
think,
except
that
they've
got
the
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
because
i
was
asking
the
questions
your
honor.
i
didn't
want
to
even
go
into
that.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir.
i
have
--
i
was
forced
into
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
why
don't
they
work?
mr.
richard
c.
seither
that's
precisely
our
case.
that
all
the
other
things
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact
that
he
stands
convicted
up
here.
i
wrote
in
brief
but
i
say
here,
the
only
thing
properly
before
the
court
in
the
city's
view
is
the
uncontroverted
evidence
that
this
man
butted
these
police
officers
from
wall
to
wall
and
say,
put
himself
down
like
a
full
bag
running
through
a
line
and
butted
these
men
from
wall
to
wall.
that
went
uncontroverted.
this
was
said
in
front
of
mr.
wainwright
in
the
court
of
law.
and
when
he
had
a
chance
to
controvert,
he
took
the
stand.
i
know
if
it
would
be
fairly
defective
for
me
to
comment
on
his
refusal
to
take
the
stand
but
he
took
the
stand.
in
his
total
testimony,
it's
less
than
a
page,
with
them
making
all
these
statements
but
he
didn't
deny
anything.
that's
what
i
mean
when
i
say
it
went
un-controverted.
i
agree
mr.
justice
white
and
i
have
two
cases
that
i
wanted
to
cite
when
you
ask
me
too.
that
i
think
this
case
goes
off
on
the
whole
case
of
1910.
mr.
justice
marshall
raised
a
question
yesterday,
the
whole
case
which
was
reasserted
in
schmerber
as
being
the
leading
case
in
the
considerations
in
schmerber.
they
had
made
this
man
model
of
glass.
and
since
then,
i
think
it
has
been
held
repeatedly
through
the
years.
i'd
like
to
jeopardize
the
whole
cases
where
an
exploratory
search
of
the
body
--
if
you
want
to
use
the
word
search,
is
permissible.
certainly,
if
we
could
have
a
bloodletting,
mr.
justice
douglas
or
an
intrusion
into
the
bloodstream
to
get
evidence
against
a
person,
we
can
certainly
ask
him
to
remove
his
jacket
for
all
purpose
of
search.
but
the
city
contends
there
was
never
any
search
made
here.
when
this
man
refused
to
take
off
his
jacket,
we
did
not
arrest
him.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
don't
know,
put
on
the
testimony
and
convict
him
at
what
happened
in
the
street?
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
when
i
said
it
was
irrelevant
to
the
case,
i've
got
to
mr.
justice
white's
position
that
the
only
thing
properly
before
this
court
now
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
thought
you'd
ask
me
if
that
wasn't
the
main
point
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
alright.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
the
city
said
in
brief
that
it's
irrelevant
but
the
city
is
willing
to
meet
the
issues
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
alright,
and
i
say
it
is
not.
and
i
say
for
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
it
is
not
relevant
for
these
reasons.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
it
was
raised
by
civil
liberties
and
my
position
in
the
case
was
to
answer.
i
didn't
bring
it
up
here
first
today.
i
was
asked
these
questions,
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
because
he
was
tried
in
these
matters
on
the
street
for
what
happened
on
the
street.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
but
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
he
was
convicted
only
at
the
street
level
of
resisting
an
officer.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
at
the
request
of
the
justices
up
here.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
don't
quite
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes,
as
i
have.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes,
your
honor.
and
that's
strong
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
where
i
said
it
was
irrelevant,
your
honor
please.
i
thought
we
were
in
the
area
of
search.
in
my
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
question.
no
question,
the
arrest
was
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes
sir.
i
have
here
a
complete
pbi
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir.
there's
one,
it
was
--
yes,
there
was
a
picture
of
the
same
one
that's
here
that
was
introduced
as
exhibit
a.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
don't
know
sir.
i
do
know
that
it
was
offered
in
evidence
as
exhibit
a.
i
do
have
it
here
if
you
want
me
to
put
it
into
the
record.
and
you
see
it
originally
mr.
justice,
i
didn't
--
i'll
put
the
whole
thing
if
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir,
it
is
not
my
position
in
that.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we've
just
adopted
mr.
(inaudible)
has
just
drawn
up
a
stop
and
frisk
law
which
we
say,
we
have
a
right
to
stop
a
man
and
ask
him
questions
but
his
refusal
to
answer
question
does
not
justify
his
arrest.
we
are
saying
that
he
was
not
arrested
for
his
refusal
to
answer
questions
or
his
refusal
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
that's
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
when
he
walked
away
from
the
interrogation
three
times
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
well,
and
i
answer
that
question
affirmatively,
your
honor.
i
believe
if
we
don't
have
--
that
we
do
have
the
right
to
question,
but
otherwise,
if
a
police
officer
wanted
to
stop
anybody
for
anything,
if
he
can
unilaterally
decide
what
he
can
away
from,
what
inquiries
he
see
can
stay
then
and
that
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
think
so.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
well
then
we're
back
perhaps
to
henry.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
think
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
well
i
don't
know
either,
mr.
justice.
i
realized
that
i'm
not
speaking
up
here
adamantly;
i
realized
that
law
is
something
in
which
the
longer
we're
in
it,
the
lesser
we
speak
positively.
i
know,
i
don't
know.
i'm
only
trying
to
answer
the
question.
i
think
the
henry
case
could
be
invoked
that
he
was
under
arrest
at
the
moment
he
was
deprived
of
his
freedom
of
action.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
think
you
have
to
do
something
before
you
put
him
in
custody.
you
have
to
at
least
keep
him
from
walking
away.
otherwise,
he
could
never
be
put
onto
custody.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
then
he
doesn't
have
to.
if
we
ask
him
questions
and
he
doesn't
answer
them
satisfactorily,
then
under
the
law
of
stop
and
frisk
ordinance
which
we
just
passed,
that
is
no
basis
for
arresting
him
and
it
wasn't
done
in
this
case
alone.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
that's
right
sir.
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
yes,
we
could
have
arrested
him.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
we
can
arrest
the
man
for
things
other
than
the
answers
he
gives.
we
could
arrest
him
because
he
looked
just
like
the
man
we
wanted
in
murder
which
is
the
reason
we
did
it.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir.
and
there
was
nothing
done
with
him
until
he
was
put
in
the
custody
of
the
law.
when
he
refused
to
remove
his
jacket,
nothing
was
done.
it
was
at
the
station
house
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no
sir.
and
we
didn't
do
it.
we
requested
him
to
remove
his
jacket.
when
he
refused,
nothing
happened.
that
is
our
point
and
when
he
got
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
sir?
mr.
richard
c.
seither
no,
but
even
after
he
was
placed
in
custody
on
the
street,
when
we
charged
him
with
resisting
an
officer
and
vagrancy,
we
still
didn't
make
him
do
it.
we
never
did
order
him
to
do
anything
until
we've
got
to
the
precinct
station.
and
there,
nothing
was
done
for
some
15
minutes.
they
called
the
lieutenant.
they
said,
“we
know
how
to
handle
this.”
lieutenant
explained
to
him
before
we
can
--
of
course
we
think
legally
the
whole
case,
would
say
if
you
can
examine
a
person
in
exploratory
search
of
the
body
for
identifying
marks.
the
whole
case
says
this,
astriago
(ph)
says
it
but
to
answer
your
question
mr.
justice,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
was
not
ordered
to
take
off
anything
at
the
bourbon
street
scene.
he
was
requested
and
when
it
refused,
nothing
happened.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
because
it
was
reversed
at
the
district
court
level.
but
the
butting
of
the
police
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i'd
say
that
by
way
of
argument.
however,
when
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
precisely
mr,
justice.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
see
the
case
precisely
as
you
stated,
your
honor
and
i'd
say
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i
was
asked
to
answer
about
vagrancy
and
arrest.
i
just
said
it
wasn't
as
a
holding
charge
but
i
would
say
this,
the
only
two
matters
before
this
court
are
the
convictions
on
assaulting
an
officer,
two
officers.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
i've
said
that
repeatedly
mr.
justice,
throughout
the
brief.
and
today
i
would
have
said
it
but
i
was
interrupted
to
go
into
the
vagrancy
by
means
of
pending
investigation.
mr.
richard
c.
seither
resisting
an
officer,
he
was
convicted
of
it
in
the
municipal
court
--
when
it
went
to
the
criminal
district
court,
i
meant
judge
thomas
brahney
reversed
resisting
an
officer
because
he
said
--
mr.
richard
c.
seither
that
is
out.
and
so
the
only
matters
probably
before
this
court
in
the
view
of
the
city
are
the
convictions,
two
convictions
of
assaulting
two
police
officers
in
the
station.
and
that
testimony
went
un-controverted.
mr.
richard
c.

did
take
him
to
bat
on

the
matter
was
interrupted
and
continued

a
dump
that
leave
on
it
in
25,000
in
the
garbage
can
but
their
life,
their
mode
of
living
was
out
of
for
vagrancy.
