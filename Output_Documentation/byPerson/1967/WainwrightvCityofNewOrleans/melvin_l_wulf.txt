mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
fortas
raised
the
issue
yesterday
which
i
want
to
clarify,
reexamine
the
record
or
the
question
exactly
when
the
arrest
for
vagrancy
took
place.
it
appears
without
any
dispute
in
the
record,
that
the
arresting
officer
made
the
arrest
of
vagrancy
on
the
street
and
specifically,
explicitly
told
the
petitioner
on
the
street
that
he
was
arresting
him
for
vagrancy.
that
appears
on
the
record
at
the
be
168-169
and
again
at
be
148.
i
argued
yesterday
that
the
arrest
was
unlawful,
if
that
so
caused
the
search
itself
consequently
unlawful.
even
if
the
arrest
is
found
by
this
court
to
be
lawful,
though
we
don’t
concede
that
it
was,
we
still
contend
that
the
search
was
nonetheless
unlawful
for
several
reasons.
first,
it
doesn’t
satisfy
the
requirements
for
a
search
incidental
to
an
arrest
and
that’s
so
whether
or
not
the
arrest
is
found
to
be
either
for
vagrancy
or
for
murder.
search
is
incident
to
arrest
of
unjustified
on
only
two
grounds.
one,
to
prevent
destruction
of
evidence
that
might
be
in
the
possession
of
the
suspect
and
in
this
case
the
only
evidence
they’re
looking
for
was
a
tattoo
which
is
not
susceptible
to
destruction.
and
the
second
reason
is
to
seize
any
weapons
which
the
defendant
might
have
in
his
possession
which
could
endanger
the
arresting
officers.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i’m
talking
about
the
attempted
search
on
the
street
and
the
actual
search
in
the
police
station,
your
honor,
the
forcible
search
in
which
they
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
attempted
search
of
wainwright’s
body
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
to
take
off
his
jacket
and
to
see
whether
his
arm
has
tattoo.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
it
does
and
i
think
that
the
--
we
have
support
for
that
in
schmerber,
where
schmerber
spoke
about
two
--
they
spoke
of
invasions
of
the
body
but
it
seems
to
be
a
matter
of
degree
of
the
right
to
privacy
that’s
being
invaded.
but
i
think
drawing
upon
schmerber
that
the
search
--
the
identification
of
an
individual
on
the
circumstance
of
this
case
is
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
i
can
draw
upon
schmerber
for
support
the
proposition
that
the
police
here
before
they
search
wainwright
should
have
gotten
a
search
warrant.
schmerber
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
proceeding
on
the
substantive
search
is,
that
the
arrest
is
valid
in
the
first
place.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
would
think
that
if
there
is
time
and
if
there
is
no
danger
as
there
was
in
schmerber
of
the
evidence
anticipating
or
disappearing
that
the
--
in
the
interest
of
the
right
to
privacy
that
the
police
officer
should
be
required
to
get
a
search.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
not
to
make
an
observation
of
that
sort
which
appears
right
on
the
visible
surface
of
the
body.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
shows,
except
that
it
was
covered
up
by
clothing.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no
sir,
i
don’t.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that’s
so
vague
--
i
don’t
think
i
can
--
i
don’t
think
i
can
argue
that,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well
i
make
a
different
argument
in
the
premise
non-vague
having
to
do
with
the
denial
of
right
to
counsel
to
wainwright
in
this
case.
that
underway
he
should
have
been
entitled
to
counsel.
i
move
away
in
that
argument
from
the
search
argument.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
with
some
difficulty,
your
honor,
i
confess
except
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
i
do
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
the
arrest
itself
was
illegal
and
absent
that
i
confess,
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
make
the
search
warrant
argument
but
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
i
would
think
that
it
would
have
been
better
and
more
constant
with
the
fourth
amendment
for
the
police
officers
to
secure
a
search
warrant
to
effect
the
search
which
he
had
to
be
done
forcibly.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
in
a
practical
sense,
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
they
would
have
--
if
that
was
standard
practice
in
the
police
station.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
suppose
in
the
course
of
his
changing
of
clothes
that
they
would
have
made
the
--
they
would
have
been
able
to
see
whether
the
tattoo
was
on
in
his
arm.
but
that
apparently
was
not
a
standard
practice
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
don’t
think
that’s
so
--
i
don’t
know
but
i
don’t
think
it
so
in
city
jails.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
as
testimony
in
the
record
to
that
effect
your
honor,
except.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it’s
disputed
by
the
police
lieutenant
in
charge
of
the
police
station.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
he
said
he
didn’t
see
wainwright
kick
anyone.
he
said,
he
didn’t
do
--
this
is
the
police
lieutenant
speaking.
he
said
the
question.
he
didn’t
do
anything
but
tried
to
hold
the
jacket
on.
and
so
they
tried
to
take
it
off
and
he
was
trying
to
keep
the
jacket
on.
question,
he
held
very
still?
answer,
no,
it
was
a
struggle.
did
he
strike
out
of
the
officers?
answer,
no.
did
he
kick
the
officers?
the
lieutenant
then
said,
he
didn’t
see
he
could
have,
it
wasn’t
visible
to
him.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well
we
have
two
court
findings
that
the
officers
were
bounced
off
the
wall.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
what
we
do
at
that
is
that
the
next
argument
of
course
is
that
wainwright,
if
the
arrest
and
search
was
unlawful,
that
wainwright
had
a
right
to
resist
the
search.
if
that
right
is
recognized
then
he
also
had
the
right
to
use
the
necessary
amount
of
force
to
resist
the
search
or
and
i’m
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
pardon
sir?
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well
that
would
require
determination
of
whether
under
the
circumstances
the
kind
of
resistance
that
wainwright
put
up
was
or
was
not
reasonable.
but
he
did
have
five
officers
on
him
trying
to
remove
his
--
trying
to
remove
his
jacket.
under
the
circumstances,
i
suppose
inevidently
there
was
going
to
be
some
motion
between
the
five
officers
and
wainwright
himself
in
trying
to
resist
the
--
their
taking
his
jacket
off.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes
sir.
that
is
one
of
the
principle
issues.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
sir
under
those
circumstances,
i
don’t
think
that
would
be
a
reasonable
amount
of
force
to
think
they
have
a
right
to
refuse
to
speak.
i
don’t
think
you
have
a
right
to
assault
the
police
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
under
the
circumstance
of
the
--
in
your
interrogation
hypothetical,
no,
no,
because
that
wasn’t
the
question
of
the
police
applying
any
physical
force
to
him.
if
it’s
a
questions
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
but
that
doesn’t
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
make
no
argument
at
all
that
the
mere
violation
of
constitutional
rights
gives
the
victim
the
right
to
use
any
kind
of
physical
force
at
all.
that’s
no
part
of
my
argument
or
whatsoever.
my
argument
is
where
there
are
physical
hands
laid
on
the
accused
or
defendant
whatever
he
may
be.
and
the
police
are
trying
to
make
an
arrest
or
a
search
which
requires
their
physical
--
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
if
it’s
necessary
to
resist
the
assault
by
the
police,
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
don’t
disagree,
your
honor.
i
think
that
in
some
circumstances,
i
think
it’s
going
to
be
in
a
very
small
number
of
circumstances.
the
kind
of
invasion
against
a
particular
sensibilities
of
the
individual
are
inevitably
going
to
result
in
his
resentment
and
use
of
physical
force
to
resist
what
he
believes,
and
he
does
at
his
risk
for
it,
where
he
believes
to
be
an
unlawful
arrest
or
seizure.
and
i
think
it’s
inevitable
that
this
is
going
to
occur
from
time
to
time.
i
don’t
recommend
it,
sir.
i
do
defend
it.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that
lies
at
the
bottom
of
the
argument,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
let
me
just
clarify
what
the
situation
is
about
this
trial.
that's
all
i
want
to
say.
he
was
first
tried
on
vagrancy
reviling
and
resisting.
the
statement
on
this
case,
at
the
end
of
the
state's
case,
they
discontinued
that
case
and
filed
the
three
new
charges
against
him
which
were
two
charges
of
disturbing
the
peace
for
assaulting
the
police
officers
and
the
resistance.
it's
the
latter
three
which
are
actually
before
this
court
to
review.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
resisting
in
the
second
set
was
reversed
on
the
appeal
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
actual
judge
is
on
the
two
charges
of
breach
of
the
peace
for
assaulting
a
policeman.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that's
right
sir.
but
of
course,
but
our
theory
is
that
these
cannot
be
examined
without
examining
the
prior
arrest
on
the
street.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
because
we
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
we're
saying
that
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that's
what
we're
saying,
your
honor.
we're
saying
that
because
he
was
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution
that
the
search
of
his
--
the
attempted
search
was
unlawful
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
not
mistreated,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
but
you've
further
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
said,
yes.
we
say
he
has
the
constitutional
right
to
resist
an
unconstitutional
search.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
but
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
but
that's
current
in
the
course
of
the
police
officers'
attempting
to
take
off
his
jacket
in
order
to
see
whether
he
had
the
tattoo.
that
was
the
scuffle.
it
was
intimately,
directly
related
to
the
attempted
search.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
absolutely.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that
is
precisely
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
fortas
raised
the
issue
yesterday
which
i
want
to
clarify,
reexamine
the
record
or
the
question
exactly
when
the
arrest
for
vagrancy
took
place.
it
appears
without
any
dispute
in
the
record,
that
the
arresting
officer
made
the
arrest
of
vagrancy
on
the
street
and
specifically,
explicitly
told
the
petitioner
on
the
street
that
he
was
arresting
him
for
vagrancy.
that
appears
on
the
record
at
the
be
168-169
and
again
at
be
148.
i
argued
yesterday
that
the
arrest
was
unlawful,
if
that
so
caused
the
search
itself
consequently
unlawful.
even
if
the
arrest
is
found
by
this
court
to
be
lawful,
though
we
don’t
concede
that
it
was,
we
still
contend
that
the
search
was
nonetheless
unlawful
for
several
reasons.
first,
it
doesn’t
satisfy
the
requirements
for
a
search
incidental
to
an
arrest
and
that’s
so
whether
or
not
the
arrest
is
found
to
be
either
for
vagrancy
or
for
murder.
search
is
incident
to
arrest
of
unjustified
on
only
two
grounds.
one,
to
prevent
destruction
of
evidence
that
might
be
in
the
possession
of
the
suspect
and
in
this
case
the
only
evidence
they’re
looking
for
was
a
tattoo
which
is
not
susceptible
to
destruction.
and
the
second
reason
is
to
seize
any
weapons
which
the
defendant
might
have
in
his
possession
which
could
endanger
the
arresting
officers.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i’m
talking
about
the
attempted
search
on
the
street
and
the
actual
search
in
the
police
station,
your
honor,
the
forcible
search
in
which
they
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
attempted
search
of
wainwright’s
body
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
to
take
off
his
jacket
and
to
see
whether
his
arm
has
tattoo.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
it
does
and
i
think
that
the
--
we
have
support
for
that
in
schmerber,
where
schmerber
spoke
about
two
--
they
spoke
of
invasions
of
the
body
but
it
seems
to
be
a
matter
of
degree
of
the
right
to
privacy
that’s
being
invaded.
but
i
think
drawing
upon
schmerber
that
the
search
--
the
identification
of
an
individual
on
the
circumstance
of
this
case
is
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
i
can
draw
upon
schmerber
for
support
the
proposition
that
the
police
here
before
they
search
wainwright
should
have
gotten
a
search
warrant.
schmerber
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
proceeding
on
the
substantive
search
is,
that
the
arrest
is
valid
in
the
first
place.
mr.
melvin

i
would
think
that

as
there
was
in

of
the

that
the

in
the
interest
of
the
right
to
privacy
that
the
police
officer
should
be
required
to
get
a
search.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
not
to
make
an
observation
of
that
sort
which
appears
right
on

of

mr.
melvin

it

except
that
it
was
covered
up
by
clothing.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no
sir,
i
don’t.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that’s
so
vague
--
i
don’t
think
i
can
--
i
don’t
think
i
can
argue
that,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well
i
make
a
different
argument
in
the
premise
non-vague
having
to
do
with
the
denial
of
right
to
counsel
to
wainwright

this
case.
that
underway

i
move
away
in
that
argument
from
the
search
argument.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
with
some
difficulty,
your
honor,
i
confess
except
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
i
do
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
the

illegal

mr.

mr.

it’s
disputed
by
the
police
lieutenant
in
charge
of
the

mr.

he
said
he
didn’t
see
wainwright
kick
anyone.
he
said,
he
didn’t
do
--
this
is
the
police
lieutenant
speaking.
he
said
the
question.
he
didn’t
do
anything
but
tried
to
hold
the
jacket
on.
and
so
they
tried
to
take
it
off
and
he
was
trying
to
keep
the
jacket
on.
question,
he
held
very
still?
answer,
no,
it
was
a
struggle.
did
he
strike
out
of
the
officers?
answer,
no.
did
he
kick
the
officers?
the
lieutenant
then
said,
he
didn’t
see
he
could
have,
it
wasn’t
visible
to
him.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well
we
have
two
court
findings
that
the
officers
were
bounced
off
the
wall.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
what
we
do
at
that
is
that
the
next
argument
of
course
is
that
wainwright,
if
the
arrest
and
search
was
unlawful,
that
wainwright
had
a
right
to
resist
the
search.
if
that
right
is
recognized
then
he
also
had
the
right
to
use
the
necessary
amount
of
force
to
resist
the
search
or
and
i’m
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
pardon
sir?
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well
that
would
require
determination
of
whether
under
the
circumstances
the
kind
of
resistance
that
wainwright
put
up
was
or
was
not
reasonable.
but
he
did
have
five
officers
on
him
trying
to
remove
his
--
trying
to
remove
his
jacket.
under
the
circumstances,
i
suppose
inevidently
there
was
going
to
be
some
motion
between
the
five
officers
and
wainwright
himself
in
trying
to
resist
the
--
their
taking
his
jacket
off.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes
sir.
that
is
one
of
the
principle
issues.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
sir
under
those
circumstances,
i
don’t
think
that
would
be
a
reasonable
amount
of
force
to
think
they
have
a
right
to
refuse
to
speak.
i
don’t
think
you
have
a
right
to
assault
the
police
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
under
the
circumstance
of
the
--
in
your
interrogation
hypothetical,
no,
no,
because
that
wasn’t
the
question
of
the
police
applying
any
physical
force
to
him.
if
it’s
a
questions
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
but
that
doesn’t
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
make
no
argument
at
all
that
the
mere
violation
of
constitutional
rights
gives
the
victim
the
right
to
use
any
kind
of
physical
force
at
all.
that’s
no
part
of
my
argument
or
whatsoever.
my
argument
is
where
there
are
physical
hands
laid
on
the
accused
or
defendant
whatever
he
may
be.
and
the
police
are
trying
to
make
an
arrest
or
a
search
which
requires
their
physical
--
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
if
it’s
necessary
to
resist
the
assault
by
the
police,
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
don’t
disagree,
your
honor.
i
think
that
in
some
circumstances,
i
think
it’s
going
to
be
in
a
very
small
number
of
circumstances.
the
kind
of
invasion
against
a
particular
sensibilities
of
the
individual
are
inevitably
going
to
result
in
his
resentment
and
use
of
physical
force
to
resist
what
he
believes,
and
he
does
at
his
risk
for
it,
where
he
believes
to
be
an
unlawful
arrest
or
seizure.
and
i
think
it’s
inevitable
that
this
is
going
to
occur
from
time
to
time.
i
don’t
recommend
it,
sir.
i
do
defend
it.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that
lies
at
the
bottom
of
the
argument,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
let
me
just
clarify
what
the
situation
is
about
this
trial.
that's
all
i
want
to
say.
he
was
first
tried
on
vagrancy
reviling
and
resisting.
the
statement
on
this
case,
at
the
end
of
the
state's
case,
they
discontinued
that
case
and
filed
the
three
new
charges
against
him
which
were
two
charges
of
disturbing
the
peace
for
assaulting
the
police
officers
and
the
resistance.
it's
the
latter
three
which
are
actually
before
this
court
to
review.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
resisting
in
the
second
set
was
reversed
on
the
appeal
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
actual
judge
is
on
the
two
charges
of
breach
of
the
peace
for
assaulting
a
policeman.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that's
right
sir.
but
of
course,
but
our
theory
is
that
these
cannot
be
examined
without
examining
the
prior
arrest
on
the
street.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
because
we
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
we're
saying
that
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that's
what
we're
saying,
your
honor.
we're
saying
that
because
he
was
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution
that
the
search
of
his
--
the
attempted
search
was
unlawful
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
not
mistreated,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
but
you've
further
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
said,
yes.
we
say
he
has
the
constitutional
right
to
resist
an
unconstitutional
search.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
but
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
but
that's
current
in
the
course
of
the
police
officers'
attempting
to
take
off
his
jacket
in
order
to
see
whether
he
had
the
tattoo.
that
was
the
scuffle.
it
was
intimately,
directly
related
to
the
attempted
search.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
absolutely.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that
is
precisely
our
position,
your
honor.
