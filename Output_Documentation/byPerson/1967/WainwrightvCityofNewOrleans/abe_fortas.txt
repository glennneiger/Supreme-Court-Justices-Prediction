justice
abe
fortas
what's
the
basis
of
--
mr.
wulf,
why
do
you
say
he
was
arrested
for
vagrancy?
justice
abe
fortas
what
proof?
but
when
they
picked
him
out
and
brought
him
in,
i
thought
that
they
brought
him
in
because
he
looked
like
johnny
mctaylor
and
he
refused
to
take
out
his
jacket
so
they
could
see
whether
he
did
--
the
man
have
identification
marks
and
then
when
they
got
him
in
there
they
put
him
on
--
they
got
to
charge
him.
well,
isn't
there
a
difference
between
the
basis
on
which
the
police
caused
a
person
on
the
sidewalk
and
take
him
in
hence
--
and
whether
or
not
there
are
difference
between
the
reason
why
they
do
that
and
based
on
the
charged
with
which
he
is
booked,
the
charge
for
he
is
booked?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
the
charge
for
which
he's
booked
to
this
government
for
all
legal
purposes.
justice
abe
fortas
well
here
isn't
that
a
matter
of
fact
that
they
took
him
into
custody
because
they
thought
he
looked
like
johnny
mctaylor,
whatever
they
call
his
name
is
and
they
had
no
way
of
identifying
him
and
he
refused
to
take
out
his
jacket.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
think
this
testimony
is
very
self-sufficient
in
both
ways
on
the
record,
as
i
remember.
but
in
any
event
the
police
officers
have
the
following
choices
and
they
wanted
him
to
just
take
out
his
jacket.
either
to
let
him
go
or
assuming
that
he
was
not
mctaylor
or
to
--
may
then
take
his
jacket
right
then
and
there
by
physical
force
or
take
him
into
the
police
station,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
in
what
way
they
have
the
man
in
surveillance?
justice
abe
fortas
right,
in
order
to
tell
him
or
his
family.
just
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question,
and
you're
challenging
the
arrest?
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
to
say
that
do
you
think
that
even
though
the
police
thought
that
he
looked
like
mctaylor
and
even
though
he
refused
to
take
out
his
jacket
so
that
he
could
satisfy
themselves,
that
they
had
no
authority
to
arrest
in
a
constitutional
manner.
justice
abe
fortas
what’s
the
implication
of
your
argument
with
respect
to
the
lineup?
would
you
take
the
position
that
requiring
a
prisoner
in
a
lineup
or
persons
in
a
lineup
to
take
off
their
jacket
or
put
on
their
jacket
or
take
on
--
taking
off
their
hat
or
put
on
a
hat,
that
that’s
an
unlawful
action
by
the
police
in
the
lineup?
justice
abe
fortas
i
shouldn’t
either
and
i
wonder
how
you
distinguish
the
present
case
from
it.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
understand
that
but
unhappily
that
perhaps
for
it
for
your
present
argument
that
not
all
that
way
it
says.
if
the
police
may
require
a
prisoner,
a
person
who
has
been
arrested
to
remove
his
jacket
for
purposes
of
a
lineup
without
getting
a
search
warrant,
how
do
you
defend
your
position
in
the
present
case
in
that
respect?
justice
abe
fortas
what
acts
of
vagrancy
did
he
commit?
justice
abe
fortas
he
was
admitted.
he
was
arrested
for
vagrancy.
what
acts
of
vagrancy
did
he
commit?
justice
abe
fortas
that’s
getting
off
of
vagrancy.
justice
abe
fortas
what
i’m
interested
in,
what
acts
of
vagrancy
did
he
commit?
justice
abe
fortas
how
would
you
address
like
a
vagrant?
justice
abe
fortas
shabby
clothes?
justice
abe
fortas
have
you
ever
been
around
the
university
or
college?
justice
abe
fortas
but
it’s
a
quarter
condemned
by
the
public
where
it’s
made
by
the
public
authorities
where
anyone
can
go.
justice
abe
fortas
didn’t
he
tell
you
to
offer
he
lived
and
what
his
business
was?
justice
abe
fortas
three
times
for
vagrancy?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
an
element
of
vagrancy?
justice
abe
fortas
have
you
any
cases
on
that
to
show
that
the
fact
that
a
man
is
not
cooperative
with
the
police
for
vagrancy?
justice
abe
fortas
we’re
talking
now
about
vagrancy,
not
anything
else.
not
into
resisting
an
officer,
we’re
talking
about
vagrancy.
what
acts
of
his
were
acts
of
vagrancy?
justice
abe
fortas
he
told
you
he
gave
you
identification.
he
told
you
he
lived
four
blocks
from
there
and
he
told
you
to
go
there.
justice
abe
fortas
how
much
did
he
have
on
him?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
mr.
wainwright
had
been
extremely
well-dressed
and
a
$156
in
his
pocket.
and
the
identification
card
showed
and
demonstrated
that
instead
of
going
to
the
law
school,
notorious
behavior,
lots
of
vagrants
do
that.
instead
of
going
to
the
law
school,
he
was
honestly
employed
somewhere.
but
suppose
that
he
looked
exactly
like
johnny
mctailor,
the
police
had
a
picture
of
johnny
mctailor,
when
they
saw
this
well-dressed
fellow
walking
down
the
street.
they
went
up
to
him
and
they
said,
“will
you
remove
your
jacket
so
we
could
see
if
there
is
a
tattoo
on
your
arm?”
and
he
said,
“no.”
now
what
could
the
police
have
done
other
than
--
let’s
assume
that
i
wasn’t
wrong
but
just
for
this
question
let’s
assume
he
is
wrong
for
the
charging
with
vagrancy.
justice
abe
fortas
that’s
right
because
he
look
behind.
but
let’s
suppose
that
--
well
what
could
they
have
done
then?
now
he
says,
“i’m
not
going
to
remove
my
jacket.”
it’s
an
impolitely
kind
of
a
exposure
that
i
being
an
employed
gentleman
and
not
employed
law
student
don’t
believe
him.
what
could
he
have
done?
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
--
it
looks
like
johnny
mctailor,
what
do
they
do
next?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
he
didn’t
and
just
stayed
there?
justice
abe
fortas
just
state
that.m
justice
abe
fortas
you
just
stay
with
me
for
a
while.
justice
abe
fortas
they
might
have
arrested
him
and
booked
him
for
murder.
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
he
would
have
had
a
chance
to
say,
well
i’m
not
--
sometimes,
you’ll
let
the
man
have
a
chance
to
demonstrate
that
he
is
not
johnny
mctailor
by
taking
off
his
jacket
and
no
matter
how
much
made
him
shudder
exposing
his
left
forearm.
justice
abe
fortas
shudder,
shudder,
how
much
you
examine
that,
i
mean
to
engage
the
man
in
a
decent
act
of
exposing
his
left
forearm
instead
of
exonerating
himself
by
doing
it,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
so
then
what
you
come
down
to
here
perhaps
is
the
question
of
whether
in
those
circumstances
the
police
can
arrest
a
man
on
what
he’s
arguably
opposing
charge
of
vagrancy.
justice
abe
fortas
i
heard
what
you
said.
you
don’t
do
that
in
new
orleans.
but
here,
they
arrested
him
for
vagrancy.
let's
suppose
that
it
isn't
for
(inaudible)
charge
and
what
i'm
suggesting
is
perhaps
at
issue
here
is
that
it
changed
the
facts
as
i've
indicated
or
elucidate
facts
the
way
i've
tried
to
do
it.
the
question
is
not
whether
that
was
the
cause
of
his
arrest
but
whether
he
was
arrested
on
a
charge
that
was
not
justified
in
the
circumstances.
justice
abe
fortas
for
vagrancy?
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you,
do
we
have
the
picture
or
(inaudible)
and
the
other
man
in
the
street.
justice
abe
fortas
it
was
in
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
where
can
we
look
at
it
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
your
position
that
the
city
has
a
right
to
stop
him
on
the
street
that
he
was
suspected
of
a
crime,
and
asked
him
questions,
and
if
they
don't
answer,
then
he
can
be
arrested
for
resisting
an
officer?
justice
abe
fortas
the
day
he
was
not
investigated.
justice
abe
fortas
when
did
you
get
in
custody?
justice
abe
fortas
that
gets
back
to
the
question.
do
you
have
a
right
to
stop
him
and
interrogate
him?
justice
abe
fortas
he
could
until
he
was
arrested
--
.
justice
abe
fortas
you
can't
just
stop
a
man
on
the
street
without
putting
him
on
custody
and
proceed
to
examine
this,
didn't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
know.
justice
abe
fortas
can
you
do
anything
with
the
citizen
until
he's
put
on
custody
and
forcing
him
to
do
so?
justice
abe
fortas
you
might
be
question
but
he
might
choose
not
to
answer?
justice
abe
fortas
could
you
stop
and
ask
him
briefly
and
you
say
you
can't
make
him
answer
for
that?
justice
abe
fortas
then
you
can't
do
anything
to
him
if
he
leaves
them
while
you're
doing
this
to
him.
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
--
if
you
can't
arrest
him.
(voice
overlap)
i
mean
you
don't
have
a
right
to
make
him
answer
you.
justice
abe
fortas
can
you
do
anything
with
him
as
a
citizen
until
you
put
him
in
the
custody
of
the
law?
justice
abe
fortas
could
you
stop
a
man
on
the
street
to
make
him
remove
his
jacket?
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
he
wasn't
in
custody
then,
was
he?
justice
abe
fortas
why
are
you
saying
that
i
didn't
quite
get
it?
how
do
you
say
that
he
is
not
now
convicted
and
there
is
no
conviction
before
except
for
butting
his
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
you
say
that
all
we
have
before
us
and
all
we
have
the
right
to
consider
is
his
conviction
for
butting
his
head
into
the
officer's
stomach?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it's
a
little
more
than
that,
isn't
it
mr.
wulf?
if
i
understand
the
position
and
perhaps
i
don't.
you're
also
relying
on
the
allegedly
unconstitutional
arrest.
justice
abe
fortas
if
i
understand
your
position
that's
in
two
frights.
number
one
that
he
was
brought
in
to
the
police
station
in
violation
of
the
constitutional
rights
that
being
no
probable
cause
for
his
arrest.
number
two,
that
in
the
police
station,
the
officers
attempted
to
do
what
you
call
a
search
and
that
is
to
remove
his
jacket,
in
violation
of
these
constitutional
rights.
but
in
those
circumstances,
is
that
your
position
as
i
understand
it,
that
he
was
at
liberty
to
physically
to
resist
what
he
proceeded
to
do
and
he
had
a
right
to
resist
the
search
because
of
those
two
violations
to
which
i'm
referring.
and
he
could
not
be
convicted
for
disorderly
conduct
that
is
resisting
a
police
officer.
justice
abe
fortas
what's
the
basis
of
--
mr.
wulf,
why
do
you
say
he
was
arrested
for
vagrancy?
justice
abe
fortas
what
proof?
but
when
they
picked
him
out
and
brought
him
in,
i
thought
that
they
brought
him
in
because
he
looked
like
johnny
mctaylor
and
he
refused
to
take
out
his
jacket
so
they
could
see
whether
he
did
--
the
man
have
identification
marks
and
then
when
they
got
him
in
there
they
put
him
on
--
they
got
to
charge
him.
well,
isn't
there
a
difference
between
the
basis
on
which
the
police
caused
a
person
on
the
sidewalk
and
take
him
in
hence
--
and
whether
or
not
there
are
difference
between
the
reason
why
they
do
that
and
based
on
the
charged
with
which
he
is
booked,
the
charge
for
he
is
booked?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
the
charge
for
which
he's
booked
to
this
government
for
all
legal
purposes.
justice
abe
fortas
well
here
isn't
that
a
matter
of
fact
that
they
took
him
into
custody
because
they
thought
he
looked
like
johnny
mctaylor,
whatever
they
call
his
name
is
and
they
had
no
way
of
identifying
him
and
he
refused
to
take
out
his
jacket.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
think
this
testimony
is
very
self-sufficient
in
both
ways
on
the
record,
as
i
remember.
but
in
any
event
the
police
officers
have
the
following
choices
and
they
wanted
him
to
just
take
out
his
jacket.
either
to
let
him
go
or
assuming
that
he
was
not
mctaylor
or
to
--
may
then
take
his
jacket
right
then
and
there
by
physical
force
or
take
him
into
the
police
station,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
in
what
way
they
have
the
man
in
surveillance?
justice
abe
fortas
right,
in
order
to
tell
him
or
his
family.
just
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question,
and
you're
challenging
the
arrest?
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
to
say
that
do
you
think
that
even
though
the
police

justice

what’s
the
implication
of
your
argument
with
respect
to
the
lineup?
would
you
take
the
position
that
requiring
a
prisoner
in
a
lineup
or
persons
in
a
lineup
to
take
off
their
jacket
or
put
on
their
jacket
or
take
on
--
taking
off
their
hat
or
put
on
a
hat,
that
that’s
an
unlawful
action
by
the
police
in
the
lineup?
justice
abe
fortas
i
shouldn’t
either
and
i
wonder
how
you
distinguish

i

we’re

what
acts
of

were
acts
of

justice

he
told
you
he
gave

identification.
he
told

he
lived
four
blocks

to
go

justice

how

this
well-dressed
fellow
walking
down
the
street.
they
went
up
to
him
and
they
said,
“will
you
remove
your
jacket
so
we
could
see
if
there
is
a
tattoo
on
your
arm?”
and
he
said,
“no.”
now
what
could
the
police
have
done
other
than
--
let’s
assume
that
i
wasn’t
wrong
but
just
for
this
question
let’s
assume
he
is
wrong
for
the
charging
with
vagrancy.
justice
abe
fortas
that’s
right
because
he
look
behind.
but
let’s
suppose
that
--
well
what
could
they
have
done
then?
now
he
says,
“i’m
not
going
to
remove
my
jacket.”
it’s
an
impolitely
kind
of
a
exposure
that
i
being
an
employed
gentleman
and
not
employed
law
student
don’t
believe
him.
what
could
he
have
done?
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
--
it
looks
like
johnny
mctailor,
what
do
they
do
next?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
he
didn’t
and
just
stayed
there?
justice
abe
fortas
just
state
that.m
justice
abe
fortas
you
just
stay
with
me
for
a
while.
justice
abe
fortas
they
might
have
arrested
him
and
booked
him
for
murder.
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
he
would
have
had
a
chance
to
say,
well
i’m
not
--
sometimes,
you’ll
let
the
man
have
a
chance
to
demonstrate
that
he
is
not
johnny
mctailor
by
taking
off
his
jacket
and
no
matter
how
much
made
him
shudder
exposing
his
left
forearm.
justice
abe
fortas
shudder,
shudder,
how
much
you
examine
that,
i
mean
to
engage
the
man
in
a
decent
act
of
exposing
his
left
forearm
instead
of
exonerating
himself
by
doing
it,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
so
then
what
you
come
down
to
here
perhaps
is
the
question
of
whether
in
those
circumstances
the
police
can
arrest
a
man
on
what
he’s
arguably
opposing
charge
of
vagrancy.
justice
abe
fortas
i
heard
what
you
said.
you
don’t
do
that
in
new
orleans.
but
here,
they
arrested
him
for
vagrancy.
let's
suppose
that
it
isn't
for
(inaudible)
charge
and
what
i'm
suggesting
is
perhaps
at
issue
here
is
that
it
changed
the
facts
as
i've
indicated
or
elucidate
facts
the
way
i've
tried
to
do
it.
the
question
is
not
whether
that
was
the
cause
of
his
arrest
but
whether
he
was
arrested
on
a
charge
that
was
not
justified
in
the
circumstances.
justice
abe
fortas
for
vagrancy?
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you,
do
we
have
the
picture
or
(inaudible)
and
the
other
man
in
the
street.
justice
abe
fortas
it
was
in
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
where
can
we
look
at
it
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
your
position
that
the
city
has
a
right
to
stop
him
on
the
street
that
he
was
suspected
of
a
crime,
and
asked
him
questions,
and
if
they
don't
answer,
then
he
can
be
arrested
for
resisting
an
officer?
justice
abe
fortas
the
day
he
was
not
investigated.
justice
abe
fortas
when
did
you
get
in
custody?
justice
abe
fortas
that
gets
back
to
the
question.
do
you
have
a
right
to
stop
him
and
interrogate
him?
justice
abe
fortas
he
could
until
he
was
arrested
--
.
justice
abe
fortas
you
can't
just
stop
a
man
on
the
street
without
putting
him
on
custody
and
proceed
to
examine
this,
didn't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
know.
justice
abe
fortas
can
you
do
anything
with
the
citizen
until
he's
put
on
custody
and
forcing
him
to
do
so?
justice
abe
fortas
you
might
be
question
but
he
might
choose
not
to
answer?
justice
abe
fortas
could
you
stop
and
ask
him
briefly
and
you
say
you
can't
make
him
answer
for
that?
justice
abe
fortas
then
you
can't
do
anything
to
him
if
he
leaves
them
while
you're
doing
this
to
him.
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
--
if
you
can't
arrest
him.
(voice
overlap)
i
mean
you
don't
have
a
right
to
make
him
answer
you.
justice
abe
fortas
can
you
do
anything
with
him
as
a
citizen
until
you
put
him
in
the
custody
of
the
law?
justice
abe
fortas
could
you
stop
a
man
on
the
street
to
make
him
remove
his
jacket?
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
he
wasn't
in
custody
then,
was
he?
justice
abe
fortas
why
are
you
saying
that
i
didn't
quite
get
it?
how
do
you
say
that
he
is
not
now
convicted
and
there
is
no
conviction
before
except
for
butting
his
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
you
say
that
all
we
have
before
us
and
all
we
have
the
right
to
consider
is
his
conviction
for
butting
his
head
into
the
officer's
stomach?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it's
a
little
more
than
that,
isn't
it
mr.
wulf?
if
i
understand
the
position
and
perhaps
i
don't.
you're
also
relying
on
the
allegedly
unconstitutional
arrest.
justice
abe
fortas
if
i
understand
your
position
that's
in
two
frights.
number
one
that
he
was
brought
in
to
the
police
station
in
violation
of
the
constitutional
rights
that
being
no
probable
cause
for
his
arrest.
number
two,
that
in
the
police
station,
the
officers
attempted
to
do
what
you
call
a
search
and
that
is
to
remove
his
jacket,
in
violation
of
these
constitutional
rights.
but
in
those
circumstances,
is
that
your
position
as
i
understand
it,
that
he
was
at
liberty
to
physically
to
resist
what
he
proceeded
to
do
and
he
had
a
right
to
resist
the
search
because
of
those
two
violations
to
which
i'm
referring.
and
he
could
not
be
convicted
for
disorderly
conduct
that
is
resisting
a
police
officer.
