mr.
merritt
w.
green
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
actually
the
turn
of
events
here
today
is
somewhat
different
that
i
had
anticipated
and
i
had
intended
i
believe
to
pursue
the
line
that
i
pursued
when
i
was
here
in
the
gault
case
just
to
talk
about
the
--
whether
or
not
constitutionally,
you
can
reasonably
classify
within
the
area
of
adults
and
minors.
and
it's
indicated
to
me
by
the
court's
interest
in
this
other
factors
that
the
philosophical
problems
that
might
be
involved
and
the
difference
between
children
and
adults
may
not
be
the
thing
that's
foremost
in
your
mind
this
time.
aside
from
the
particular
facts
in
this
case,
i
suppose
that
there
is
this
overlaying
questions
as
to
--
role
of
the
state
the
life
of
a
child.
how
much
authority
must
or
can
the
state
have
in
the
--
over
the
child's
life.
in
other
words
i
have
differences
between
children
and
adults
such
as
to
permit
the
procedures
which
are
substantially
different.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
well,
we
would
have
to
assume
at
the
outset
because
of
the
wide
latitude
given
to
the
statute.
and
almost
universally
followed
that
the
judge
is
admonished
almost
the
statute
to
release
the
child
from
custody
to
his
parents
or
anybody
else.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that's
right
but
i
would
say
that
we
would
have
to
assume
i
believe
that
because
of
either
of
the
climate
in
the
area
or
the
nature
of
the
crime
with
which
he
was
charged,
the
court
in
its
wisdom
whether
it
was
right
or
not,
felt
that
it
would
be
better
for
buddy
whittington
to
be
retained
in
the
custody
of
the
court
or
one
of
its
officers.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
there's
no
question
about
that
under
our
law.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
this
particular
boy,
i
presume
you
could
say,
because
of
the
entanglements
of
legal
procedures
that
followed,
nothing
accrued
to
his
benefit
but
that
doesn't
make
the
statue
in
it
of
itself
unconstitutional.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
we'll
have
to
make
an
assumption
too
that
he
came
from
a
home
that
obviously
to
the
court
indicated
that
to
go
back
in
that
home
it
maybe
the
wrong
thing
for
him.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that's
right.
i
said
it
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
this
particular
boy
had
nothing
accrued
to
him
that
i
can
see
on
this
record.
actually,
one
of
the
things
and
i
must
say
this,
that's
happened
and
this
case
has
spent
too
much
lowing
in
the
case.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
the
first
part,
i
would
say
it
was
true.
now
i
don't
believe
the
basic
structure
in
it
of
itself
is
the
fault
of
any
mishandling
or
any
injustices
done
to
buddy
lynn
whittington.
because
you
would
almost
have
to
assume
that
this
is
a
routine
matter
of
denying
release
from
the
custody
of
the
court
to
any
juvenile
who
comes
before
the
court.
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
justification.
all
the
statistics
available
to
the
court
or
this
record
to
say
that
this
was
a
routine
handling
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
no,
by
all
means,
i
do
not
of
course
the
constitutional
principle
is
i
believe
stated
in
that.
it's
about
that
no
person
shall
be
required
to
give
excessive
bail.
but
i
say
and
i
only
say
this
that
i'm
not
contending
that
there
should
be
two
set
of
rules
on
the
constitution,
one
for
youngsters
and
one
for
adults,
or
that
the
constitution
doesn't
apply
to
everybody.
but
i
am
suggesting
that
you
can't
properly
create
classifications
taking
into
consideration
the
people
for
whom
you're
established
in
the
classification.
it's
not
on
--
to
all
of
those
children
in
the
law
have
always
been
considered
in
a
different
like
in
adults.
contracts
for
instance.
like
if
you
could
just
go
on
and
name
all
of
those
things
where
children
for
reasons
emotionally,
biologically,
mentally
or
whatever
the
reason
maybe
are
distinguished
from
the
adults
and
the
different
--
the
law
applies
differently
to
them.
after
all,
the
theory
of
the
juvenile
court's
law
--
the
juvenile
court's
trying
to
do.
i
think
the
philosophy
is
there.
they're
trying
to
find
out
when
somebody
or
some
youngster
becomes
entangled
in
the
law
what
caused
them
to
be
entangled
with
the
law?
and
what
can
we
do
to
either
prevent
him
from
going
on
to
life
occurring
or
what
can
we
do
to
rehabilitate
him
as
if
he
started?
mr.
merritt
w.
green
you
mean
as
to
this
boy?
no.
because
he
was
prevented
--
mr.
merritt
w.
green
sir?
mr.
merritt
w.
green
no,
i
don't
think
that's
true
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
well,
his
finding
at
the
start,
saying
that
there
has
been
a
murder
committed.
there
has
been
a
killing.
the
court
made
these
findings
and
said
that
it
maybe
that
buddy
whittington
may
have
done.
and
then
along
came
--
in
that
same
finding,
he
ordered
the
boy
to
be
sent
to
the
youth
commission
in
columbus
for
the
various
tests.
now,
it
wasn't
until
after
that
on
the
basis
of
all
these
tests
and
a
complete
investigation
the
statute
says.
that
then
he
makes
his
determination
whether
he
wants
to
keep
him
in
giving
this
treatment
that
i'm
talking
about,
or
whether
he
wants
to
having
found
that
the
boy
committed
that
backwards
committed
by
an
adult
would
have
been
a
felony.
not
necessarily
it's
a
felony.
but
then
he
makes
a
determination
whether
he
should
make
the
boy
available
to
--
the
resources
of
community
or
whether
or
not
he
should
be
tried
as
an
adult.
so
you
see
this
part
of
it
was
cut
off
really
by
the
state
of
this
record.
i
should
point
out
that
one
statement
of
fact
that
it's
apparently
little
different.
and
that
is
that
the
time
between
the
hearing
in
september
and
he
was
bound
over
because
i
really
truly
believe
that
this
was
a
preliminary
matter.
it
was
only
about
seven
months.
i
think
it
was
from
september.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
i
believe
shameful
treatment.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
that's
right.
the
point
was
that
--
i
don't
believe
that
he
followed
the
system.
you
see
because
from
the
time
this
boy
had
a
hearing
one
month
after
he
was
arrested.
and
i
think
the
record
would
show
that
that
delay
even,
some
of
it
is
on
at
the
request
of
the
boy's
lawyer.
and
from
that
time
on,
the
court
was
stopped,
prevented
from
acting.
until
after
this
court
in
preparation
for
filing
a
petition
refused
to
stay
any
longer
than
the
grand
jury.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
at
that
time,
yes.
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
right.
mr.
merritt
w.
green
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
