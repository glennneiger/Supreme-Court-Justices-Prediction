mr.
jack
supman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
juvenile
court
of
fairfield
county,
ohio,
finding
the
petitioner
to
be
a
delinquent
child.
i
will
describe
pertinent
facts
and
my
co-counsel,
mr.
rezneck,
will
present
the
legal
arguments.
petitioner,
buddy
lynn
whittington,
was
charged
with
juvenile
delinquency
on
the
basis
of
a
single
act,
the
murder
of
a
neighbor
and
family
friend,
63-year-old
mrs.
gladys
willard
on
july
29,
1966
in
the
small
village
in
baltimore,
ohio
in
violation
of
the
second
degree
murder
statute
of
ohio.
he
was
one
week
past
his
14th
birthday
when
the
case
arose.
this
boy
has
consistently
denied
this
crime.
he
had
never
been
in
trouble
with
the
law.
the
district
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
was
an
abundance
of
evidence
as
to
buddy
lynn
whittington's
good
character
and
reputation
prior
to
july
29.
he
was
regular
in
attendance
at
school,
church,
sunday
school,
and
youth
groups.
he
had
been
obedient
at
home
and
at
school,
and
subjected
himself
to
the
reasonable
control
of
both
his
parents
and
teachers.
mrs.
willard
was
reported
missing
on
july
29th.
many
persons
in
the
village,
including
the
petitioner,
engaged
in
a
search
for
her
lasting
many
hours.
her
body
was
discovered
that
evening
by
the
petitioner
and
his
father
under
the
bed
in
petitioner's
bedroom.
he
was
interrogated
that
night
by
the
principal
of
law
enforcement
officials
of
the
village
and
county,
including
the
juvenile
probation
officer.
the
defendant
was
interrogated
in
his
home,
which
was
under
the
exclusive
control
of
the
law
enforcement
officials
from
approximately
8:20
p.m.
at
home.
although
the
total
duration
of
the
questioning
is
not
established
precisely
by
the
record,
probation
officer
rutherford
was
specifically
called
after
10
p.m.
to
participate
in
an
interrogation
of
this
boy.
buddy
was
given
no
warning
as
to
his
right
to
remain
silent
or
to
have
the
advice
of
an
attorney.
while
denying
the
crime,
certain
of
his
statements
under
the
interrogation
were
used
against
him
by
the
state
in
his
trial
to
try
to
support
his
guilt.
he
was
formally
arrested
under
a
juvenile
court
warrant
issued
on
the
basis
of
a
complaint
charging
him
with
being
a
delinquent.
the
juvenile
court
judge
issued
this
warrant
after
consulting
with
the
juvenile
court
probation
officer
about
the
case.
the
probation
officer
who
is
appointed
by
the
juvenile
court
judge
and
works
under
the
direction
of
the
judge
had
interrogated
the
petitioner
on
the
night
of
the
crime,
had
accused
petitioner
of
committing
it,
had
participated
with
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
the
police
chief
in
the
decision
to
bring
the
charge,
executed
the
arrest
warrant,
and
appeared
as
a
witness
against
the
petitioner
at
the
trial.
there
is
no
doubt
from
the
record
that
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint
and
the
issuance
of
the
arrest
warrant,
probation
officer
rutherford
consulted
ex
parte
with
judge
hastings
about
the
case.
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
because
of
the
fact
that
the
judge
had
discussed
the
case
with
rutherford,
the
court
called
rutherford
as
a
witness
and
rutherford
said
he
had
reported
on
his
investigation
to
the
judge.
the
judge
himself
not
only
did
not
explain
or
testify
as
to
the
extent
of
the
consultations
but
foreclosed
further
inquiry
by
us
into
what
rutherford
reported
about
the
case
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint
and
subsequently.
after
the
arrest,
petitioner
was
put
into
solitary
confinement
in
a
cell
in
the
fairfield
county
jail
at
adult
penal
institution.
fairfield
county
does
not
have
a
juvenile
detention
facility.
the
small
cage-like
cell
had
no
light
bulb
and
it
merely
contained
a
bed
and
a
toilet.
everyone
agreed,
including
the
judge
that
this
jail
was
not
a
proper
place
of
confinement
for
a
juvenile,
but
the
state
took
the
position
that
it
was
the
only
place
they
had.
mr.
kistler
and
i
as
his
attorneys
tried
on
several
occasions
by
several
motions
to
have
him
released
on
bond
or
in
his
parents'
custody,
or
at
least
transferred
to
a
detention
home
in
an
adjoining
county
pending
the
trial.
mr.
jack
supman
yes
sir,
he's
been
in
jail
for
20
months.
mr.
rezneck
will
go
into
more
detail
with
that
at
a
later
time,
or
i
could
at
this
time,
sir.
mr.
jack
supman
yes,
sir.
after
the
adjudication
of
the
delinquency
and
the
judgement
of
delinquency,
and
after
we
filed
our
appeals
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
state
supreme
court
and
after
we
filed
our
petition
for
certiorari,
we
attempted
to
obtain
a
stay
of
proceedings
until
this
court
would
have
an
opportunity
to
see
if
it
would
take
the
case.
not
having
received
it,
the
case
then
was
remanded
by
the
state
supreme
court
down
to
the
juvenile
court,
and
it
then
did
not
retain
the
jurisdiction
but
bound
him
over
to
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
him
for
murder.
this
time
first
degree
and
the
case
is
being
held
up
subject
to
further
order
of
this
court.
mr.
jack
supman
yes,
sir.
subject
only
to
however
that
in
order
for
the
first
degree
murder
or
the
indictment
to
stand,
there
must
be
adjudication
and
a
file
of
judgment
of
delinquency.
and
of
course,
mr.
rezneck
will
explain
why
we're
asking
to
have
this
judgment
set
aside.
and
if
it
is,
then
this
other
indictment
cannot
stand
because
it
is
an
absolute
prerequisite
in
ohio
that
for
there
to
be
a
binding
over
and
an
indictment
that
there
must
be
a
valid
judgment
of
delinquency.
mr.
jack
supman
he
was
bound
over
and
he
is
still
in
jail.
and
--
mr.
jack
supman
same
jail.
mr.
jack
supman
no
sir,
it
was
the
same
jail
that
he
was
returned
to.
and
after
being
there
for
78
days,
the
court
of
appeals
found
this
was
an
improper
place.
but
after
--
and
then,
he
was
removed
to
the
detention
home
in
columbus
that
we've
been
asking
for
previously.
then
after
he
was
bound
over,
they've
brought
him
back
from
the
--
from
the
detention
home
and
putting
back
in
the
same
jail
at
solitary
confinement.
however,
in
the
last
two
or
three
months,
the
old
jail
which
we
maintained
was
in
the
records
we
show
was
improper
has
been
torn
down
and
there,
he
is
in
a
--
again,
in
adult
jail
in
fairfield
county
but
it's
a
newer
jail,
it's
a
different
jail.
mr.
jack
supman
from
august
5th
until
now,
sir.
mr.
jack
supman
in
1966,
that's
about
20
months.
mr.
jack
supman
the
original
order
was
his
arrest
in
the
juvenile
court.
mr.
jack
supman
and
subsequent
to
that
sir,
after
the
finding
of
the
delinquency
and
the
binding
over,
then
it
would
be
--
he
was
then
rearrested
and
this
would
be
under
the
order
of
the
common
pleas
court
of
fairfield
county,
ohio
from
which
we
have
appealed
the
binding
over
--
mr.
jack
supman
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
supman
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
supman
yes,
sir.
the
juvenile
--
mr.
jack
supman
yes
sir,
they
did.
they
did,
sir.
mr.
jack
supman
well,
there
were
only
two
things
the
court
could
have
done.
they
could
have
retained
jurisdiction
and
for
which
he
would
have
been
subjected
to
imprisonment
until
he
was
21
or
within
the
sole
discretion
of
the
juvenile
court,
and
this
they
did
exercise.
they
bound
him
over
to
the
grand
jury.
does
that
answer
your
question,
sir?
mr.
jack
supman
disposition?
mr.
jack
supman
he
did
not
retain
the
jurisdiction
but
then
he
bound
him
over
to
the
grand
jury.
now,
this
was
--
mr.
jack
supman
this
does
not
appear
in
the
record
because
we
appealed
from
the
determination
of
delinquency,
from
the
judgment
of
delinquency
for
the
sole
act
of
having
committed
this
murder,
we
appealed
--
mr.
jack
supman
we
appealed
immediately
from
the
finding
or
from
the
judgment
of
the
delinquency.
and
then
the
court
stated
that
he
would
be
turned
over
to
the
juvenile
center
for
examination,
which
the
statute
calls
for
in
ohio.
mr.
jack
supman
the
binding
over?
mr.
jack
supman
over
a
year,
sir,
until
the
supreme
court
--
until
--
they
did
not
take
him
for
custody
--
mr.
jack
supman
yes,
sir.
he
was
at
the
diagnostic
center
for
about
six
weeks,
then
he
was
returned
to
the
same
adult
jail
pending
these
appeals
that
we
have
had
in
the
various
courts.
mr.
jack
supman
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
supman
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
supman
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
supman
the
court
had
ordered
to
--
mr.
jack
supman
the
juvenile
court
in
this
case
as
the
record
will
show
upon
his
being
arrested,
they
retained
jurisdiction
and
they
kept
him
incarcerated,
although
we
filed
many,
many
motions
asking
for
his
release.
and
we
filed
--
mr.
jack
supman
we
asked
for
a
transcript
of
the
entire
proceedings
--
mr.
jack
supman
at
page
54
and
there's
no
subsequent
order
which
was
filed
on
september
7th.
the
cause
has
continued
pending
the
investigation
which
justice
fortas
had
referred
to.
there's
no
subsequent
order
except
that
he
is
in
jail,
and
i'm
sure
that
there's
no
question
as
far
as
the
prosecution
is
concerned.
mr.
jack
supman
yes,
sir.
they
maintained
that
even
though
he
would
--
if
he
had
been
18
years
old
instead
of
14,
this
is
not
a
capital
offense.
this
would
be
second
degree
murder
and
if
he
had
been
18,
he
would
have
been
automatically
entitled
to
bail.
but
because
he
was
under
the
age
of
18
that
it
was
completely
discretionary
with
the
judge.
he
did
not
see
fit
to
exercise
it,
and
mr.
rezneck
again
will
go
into
the
legal
arguments
as
we
have
presented
in
our
briefs.
mr.
jack
supman
after
he
had
been
incarcerated
for
about
15
months
without
bond
or
bail
when
it
was
in
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
juvenile
court,
all
during
that
time
--
mr.
jack
supman
not
as
of
right,
no
sir,
but
about
the
first
14
or
15
months,
we
were
trying
to
get
him
out
and
we
had
a
hearing,
there
were
10
witnesses.
there
was
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
without
contradiction,
these
10
witnesses
consisting
of
the
neighbors,
the
preacher,
the
superintendent
of
the
sunday
school
all
stated
that
there
was
no
fear,
there
was
no
danger
in
his
being
released.
and
without
any
evidence
to
the
contrary,
the
judge
without
any
specific
finding
as
to
the
reason
for
not
putting
him
out
on
bail
--
mr.
jack
supman
the
statute
specifically
says
in
violation
–
as
if
he
had
--
that
he
is
alleged
to
have
been
delinquent
in
that
he
committed
the
defensive
murder
which
is
in
violation
of
the
second
degree
murder
statute.
it's
very
specific
in
the
briefs
and
the
complaints
and
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
jack
supman
well,
they
just
--
if
he
had
been
an
adult,
he
would
have
been
under
a
second
degree
murder
but
as
a
juvenile
--
mr.
jack
supman
because
it
was
not
premeditated
and
i
think
that's
our
distinction
in
ohio
between
premeditated
--
between
first
and
second.
mr.
jack
supman
we
denied
it
and
the
defendant
has
denied
it
completely.
we
say
he
did
not
murder
this
woman,
sir,
and
he
is
always
so
maintained.
mr.
jack
supman
in
order
to
determine
--
no,
sir.
in
order
to
--
the
state
is
the
one
who
initiates
the
indictment
or
the
charge
and
it
was
they
who
charged
him
with
second
degree,
if
he
had
been
an
adult.
mr.
jack
supman
we
have
about
seven
points
in
the
right
to
pre-hearing
release
is
definitely
one
of
the
issues
in
this
case
because
he
was
denied
this.
mr.
jack
supman
yes,
sir.
we
--
at
this
point
--
mr.
jack
supman
this
is
the
general
inquiry.
i
think
since
we're
getting
--
since
we
have
basically
covered
the
facts
at
this
time,
if
it
may
please
the
court,
mr.
rezneck,
would
you
like
to
get
into
the
legal
argument
at
this
time?
mr.
jack
supman
excuse
me
sir,
with
the
finding
of
the
court
that
appears
in
the
record
that
the
court
in
effect
stated
that
at
the
conclusion
of
the
evidence,
we
move
to
dismiss
this
case
because
there
was
no
evidence.
and
the
court
stated
in
the
record
that
it
finds
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
defendant
may
have
committed
this
act.
and
then,
the
court
in
its
entry
of
judgment
found
him
to
be
a
delinquent,
it
did
not
say
murder,
but
the
charge
--
originally
charged
which
appears
states
specifically
that
he
is
charged
with
having
many
delinquent
and
that
he
did
kill
gladys
willard.
prior
to
the
trial,
we
made
various
motions
on
various
constitutional
grounds
and
these
all
will
appear
in
the
record.
so
these
were
all
overruled.
the
case
proceeded
to
trial.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case,
even
though
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
overruled,
the
court
of
appeals
in
their
finding,
they
applied
the
civil
standard
of
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
they
stated
the
evidence
contained
in
the
record
fails
to
disclose
any
thorough
investigation
by
officials
toward
eliminating
the
possibility
that
mrs.
gladys
willard
may
have
been
killed
by
some
other
person.
mr.
rezneck.
mr.
jack
supman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
juvenile
court
of
fairfield
county,
ohio,
finding
the
petitioner
to
be
a
delinquent
child.
i
will
describe
pertinent
facts
and
my
co-counsel,
mr.
rezneck,
will
present
the
legal
arguments.
petitioner,
buddy
lynn
whittington,
was
charged
with
juvenile
delinquency
on
the
basis
of
a
single
act,
the
murder
of
a
neighbor
and
family
friend,
63-year-old
mrs.
gladys
willard
on
july
29,
1966
in
the
small
village
in
baltimore,
ohio
in
violation
of
the
second
degree
murder
statute
of
ohio.
he
was
one
week
past
his
14th
birthday
when
the
case
arose.
this
boy
has
consistently
denied
this
crime.
he
had
never
been
in
trouble
with
the
law.
the
district
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
was
an
abundance
of
evidence
as
to
buddy
lynn
whittington's
good
character
and
reputation
prior
to
july
29.
he
was
regular
in
attendance
at
school,
church,
sunday
school,
and
youth
groups.
he
had
been
obedient
at
home
and
at
school,
and
subjected
himself
to
the
reasonable
control
of
both
his
parents
and
teachers.
mrs.
willard
was
reported
missing
on
july
29th.
many
persons
in
the
village,
including
the
petitioner,
engaged
in
a
search
for
her
lasting
many
hours.
her
body
was
discovered
that
evening
by
the
petitioner
and
his
father
under
the
bed
in
petitioner's
bedroom.
he
was
interrogated
that
night
by
the
principal
of
law
enforcement
officials
of
the
village
and
county,
including
the
juvenile
probation
officer.
the
defendant
was
interrogated
in
his
home,
which
was
under
the
exclusive
control
of
the
law
enforcement
officials
from
approximately
8:20
p.m.
at
home.
although
the
total
duration
of
the
questioning
is
not
established
precisely
by
the
record,
probation
officer
rutherford
was
specifically
called
after
10
p.m.
to
participate
in
an
interrogation
of
this
boy.
buddy
was
given
no
warning
as
to
his
right
to
remain
silent
or
to
have
the
advice
of
an
attorney.
while
denying
the
crime,
certain
of
his
statements
under
the
interrogation
were
used
against
him
by
the
state
in
his
trial
to
try
to
support
his
guilt.
he
was
formally
arrested
under
a
juvenile
court
warrant
issued
on
the
basis
of
a
complaint
charging
him
with
being
a
delinquent.
the
juvenile
court
judge
issued
this
warrant
after
consulting
with
the
juvenile
court
probation
officer
about
the
case.
the
probation
officer
who
is
appointed
by
the
juvenile
court
judge
and
works
under
the
direction
of
the
judge
had
interrogated
the
petitioner
on
the
night
of
the
crime,
had
accused
petitioner
of
committing
it,
had
participated
with
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
the
police
chief
in
the
decision
to
bring
the
charge,
executed
the
arrest
warrant,
and
appeared
as
a
witness
against
the
petitioner
at
the
trial.
there
is
no
doubt
from
the
record
that
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint
and
the
issuance
of
the
arrest
warrant,
probation
officer
rutherford
consulted
ex
parte
with
judge
hastings
about
the
case.
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
because
of
the
fact
that
the
judge
had
discussed
the
case
with
rutherford,
the
court
called
rutherford
as
a
witness
and
rutherford
said
he
had
reported
on
his
investigation
to
the
judge.
the
judge
himself
not
only
did
not
explain
or
testify
as
to
the
extent
of
the
consultations
but
foreclosed
further
inquiry
by
us
into
what
rutherford
reported
about
the
case
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint
and
subsequently.
after
the
arrest,
petitioner
was
put
into
solitary
confinement
in
a
cell
in
the
fairfield
county
jail
at
adult
penal
institution.
fairfield
county
does
not
have
a
juvenile
detention
facility.
the
small
cage-like
cell
had
no
light
bulb
and
it
merely
contained
a
bed
and
a
toilet.
everyone
agreed,
including
the
judge
that
this
jail
was
not
a
proper
place
of
confinement
for
a
juvenile,
but
the
state
took
the
position
that
it
was
the
only
place
they
had.
mr.
kistler
and
i
as
his
attorneys
tried
on
several
occasions
by
several
motions
to
have
him
released
on
bond
or
in
his
parents'
custody,
or
at
least
transferred
to
a
detention
home
in
an
adjoining
county
pending
the
trial.
mr.
jack
supman
yes
sir,
he's
been
in
jail
for
20
months.
mr.
rezneck
will
go
into
more
detail
with
that
at
a
later
time,
or
i
could
at
this
time,
sir.
mr.
jack
supman
yes,
sir.
after
the
adjudication
of
the
delinquency
and
the
judgement
of
delinquency,
and
after
we
filed
our
appeals
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
state
supreme
court
and
after
we
filed
our
petition
for
certiorari,
we
attempted
to
obtain
a
stay
of
proceedings
until
this
court
would
have
an
opportunity
to
see
if
it
would
take
the
case.
not
having
received
it,
the
case
then
was
remanded
by
the
state
supreme
court
down
to
the
juvenile
court,
and
it
then
did
not
retain
the
jurisdiction
but
bound
him
over
to
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
him
for
murder.
this
time
first
degree
and
the
case
is
being
held
up
subject
to
further
order
of
this
court.
mr.
jack
supman
yes,
sir.
subject
only
to
however
that
in
order
for
the
first
degree
murder
or
the
indictment
to
stand,
there
must
be
adjudication
and
a
file
of
judgment
of
delinquency.
and
of
course,
mr.
rezneck
will
explain
why
we're
asking
to
have
this
judgment
set
aside.
and
if
it
is,
then
this
other
indictment
cannot
stand
because
it
is
an
absolute
prerequisite
in
ohio
that
for
there
to
be
a
binding
over
and
an
indictment
that
there
must
be
a
valid
judgment
of
delinquency.
mr.
jack
supman
he
was
bound
over
and
he
is
still
in
jail.
and
--
mr.
jack
supman
same
jail.
mr.
jack
supman
no
sir,
it
was
the
same
jail
that
he
was
returned
to.
and
after
being
there
for
78
days,
the
court
of
appeals
found
this
was
an
improper
place.
but
after
--
and
then,
he
was
removed
to
the
detention
home
in
columbus
that
we've
been
asking
for
previously.
then
after
he
was
bound
over,
they've
brought
him
back
from
the
--
from
the
detention
home
and
putting
back
in
the
same
jail
at
solitary
confinement.
however,
in
the
last
two
or
three
months,
the
old
jail
which
we
maintained
was
in
the
records
we
show
was
improper
has
been
torn
down
and
there,
he
is
in
a
--
again,
in
adult
jail
in
fairfield
county
but
it's
a
newer
jail,
it's
a
different
jail.
mr.
jack
supman
from
august
5th
until
now,
sir.
mr.
jack
supman
in
1966,
that's
about
20
months.
mr.
jack
supman
the
original
order
was
his
arrest
in
the
juvenile
court.
mr.
jack
supman
and
subsequent
to
that
sir,
after
the
finding
of
the
delinquency
and
the
binding
over,
then
it
would
be
--
he
was
then
rearrested
and
this
would
be
under
the
order
of
the
common
pleas
court
of
fairfield
county,
ohio
from
which
we
have
appealed
the
binding
over
--
mr.
jack
supman
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
supman
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
supman
yes,
sir.
the
juvenile
--
mr.
jack
supman
yes
sir,
they
did.
they
did,
sir.
mr.
jack
supman
well,
there
were
only
two
things
the
court
could
have
done.
they
could
have
retained
jurisdiction
and
for
which
he
would
have
been
subjected
to
imprisonment
until
he
was
21
or
within
the
sole
discretion
of
the
juvenile
court,
and
this
they
did
exercise.
they
bound
him
over
to
the
grand
jury.
does
that
answer
your
question,
sir?
mr.
jack
supman
disposition?
mr.
jack
supman
he
did
not
retain
the
jurisdiction
but
then
he
bound
him
over
to
the
grand
jury.
now,
this
was
--
mr.
jack
supman
this
does
not
appear
in
the
record
because
we
appealed
from
the
determination
of
delinquency,
from
the
judgment
of
delinquency
for
the
sole
act
of
having
committed
this
murder,
we
appealed
--
mr.
jack
supman
we
appealed
immediately
from
the
finding
or
from
the
judgment
of
the
delinquency.
and
then
the
court
stated
that
he
would
be
turned
over
to
the
juvenile
center
for
examination,
which
the
statute
calls
for
in
ohio.
mr.
jack
supman
the
binding
over?
mr.
jack
supman
over
a
year,
sir,
until
the
supreme
court
--
until
--
they
did
not
take
him
for
custody
--
mr.
jack
supman
yes,
sir.
he
was
at
the
diagnostic
center
for
about
six
weeks,
then
he
was
returned
to
the
same
adult
jail
pending
these
appeals
that
we
have
had
in
the
various
courts.
mr.
jack
supman
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
supman
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
supman
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
supman
the
court
had
ordered
to
--
mr.
jack
supman
the
juvenile
court
in
this
case
as
the
record
will
show
upon
his
being
arrested,
they
retained
jurisdiction
and
they
kept
him
incarcerated,
although
we
filed
many,
many
motions
asking
for
his
release.
and
we
filed
--
mr.
jack
supman
we
asked
for
a
transcript
of
the
entire
proceedings
--
mr.
jack
supman
at
page
54
and
there's
no
subsequent
order
which
was
filed
on
september
7th.
the
cause
has
continued
pending
the
investigation
which
justice
fortas
had
referred
to.
there's
no
subsequent
order
except
that
he
is
in
jail,
and
i'm
sure
that
there's
no
question
as
far
as
the
prosecution
is
concerned.
mr.
jack
supman
yes,
sir.
they
maintained
that
even
though
he
would
--
if
he
had
been
18
years
old
instead
of
14,
this
is
not
a
capital
offense.
this
would
be
second
degree
murder
and
if
he
had
been
18,
he
would
have
been
automatically
entitled
to
bail.
but
because
he
was
under
the
age
of
18
that
it
was
completely
discretionary
with
the
judge.
he
did
not
see
fit
to
exercise
it,
and
mr.
rezneck
again
will
go
into
the
legal
arguments
as
we
have
presented
in
our
briefs.
mr.
jack
supman
after
he
had
been
incarcerated
for
about
15
months
without
bond
or
bail
when
it
was
in
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
juvenile
court,
all
during
that
time
--
mr.
jack
supman
not
as
of
right,
no
sir,
but
about
the
first
14
or
15
months,
we
were
trying
to
get
him
out
and
we
had
a
hearing,
there
were
10
witnesses.
there
was
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
without
contradiction,
these
10
witnesses
consisting
of
the
neighbors,
the
preacher,
the
superintendent
of
the
sunday
school
all
stated
that
there
was
no
fear,
there
was
no
danger
in
his
being
released.
and
without
any
evidence
to
the
contrary,
the
judge
without
any
specific
finding
as
to
the
reason
for
not
putting
him
out
on
bail
--
mr.
jack
supman
the
statute
specifically
says
in
violation
–
as
if
he
had
--
that
he
is
alleged
to
have
been
delinquent
in
that
he
committed
the
defensive
murder
which
is
in
violation
of
the
second
degree
murder
statute.
it's
very
specific
in
the
briefs
and
the
complaints
and
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
jack
supman
well,
they
just
--
if
he
had
been
an
adult,
he
would
have
been
under
a
second
degree
murder
but
as
a
juvenile
--
mr.
jack
supman
because
it
was
not
premeditated
and
i
think
that's
our
distinction
in
ohio
between
premeditated
--
between
first
and
second.
mr.
jack
supman
we
denied
it
and
the
defendant
has
denied
it
completely.
we
say
he
did
not
murder
this
woman,
sir,
and
he
is
always
so
maintained.
mr.
jack
supman
in
order
to
determine
--
no,
sir.
in
order
to
--
the
state
is
the
one
who
initiates
the
indictment
or
the
charge
and
it
was
they
who
charged
him
with
second
degree,
if
he
had
been
an
adult.
mr.
jack
supman
we
have
about
seven
points
in
the
right
to
pre-hearing
release
is
definitely
one
of
the
issues
in
this
case
because
he
was
denied
this.
mr.
jack
supman
yes,
sir.
we
--
at
this
point
--
mr.
jack
supman
this
is
the
general
inquiry.
i
think
since
we're
getting
--
since
we
have
basically
covered
the
facts
at
this
time,
if
it
may
please
the
court,
mr.
rezneck,
would
you
like
to
get
into
the
legal
argument
at
this
time?
mr.
jack
supman
excuse
me
sir,
with
the
finding
of
the
court
that
appears
in
the
record
that
the
court
in
effect
stated
that
at
the
conclusion
of
the
evidence,
we
move
to
dismiss
this
case
because
there
was
no
evidence.
and
the
court
stated
in
the
record
that
it
finds
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
defendant
may
have
committed
this
act.
and
then,
the
court
in
its
entry
of
judgment
found
him
to
be
a
delinquent,
it
did
not
say
murder,
but
the
charge
--
originally
charged
which
appears
states
specifically
that
he
is
charged
with
having
many
delinquent
and
that
he
did
kill
gladys
willard.
prior
to
the
trial,
we
made
various
motions
on
various
constitutional
grounds
and
these
all
will
appear
in
the
record.
so
these
were
all
overruled.
the
case
proceeded
to
trial.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case,
even
though
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
overruled,
the
court
of
appeals
in
their
finding,
they
applied
the
civil
standard
of
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
they
stated
the
evidence
contained
in
the
record
fails
to
disclose
any
thorough
investigation
by
officials
toward
eliminating
the
possibility
that
mrs.
gladys
willard
may
have
been
killed
by
some
other
person.
mr.
rezneck.
