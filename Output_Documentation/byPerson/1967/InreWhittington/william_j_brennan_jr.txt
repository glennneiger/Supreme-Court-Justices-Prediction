and
the
juvenile
court,
when
it
commits
--
say
it
decided
the
constitutional
right
of
this
young
man,
because
he's
delinquent,
what
would
the
order
be?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
without
any
flexibility
in
the
youth
commission
at

they
just
have
to
hold
him
until
he's
an
adult.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

where
would
the
town
be,
lancaster?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
let's
see,
you
say
that
the
appeal
from
the
bind
over
order
pending
in
what
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
that
has
not
been
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

you
may
now
recite
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
are
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
one
more
question
about
those
two
pieces
of
evidence?
suppose
they
are
both
truth
or
suppose
he
was
kept
in
solitary
confinement
–-
suppose
he
was
kept
in
a
place
that
had
--
what
effect
should
that
have
on
our
view
of
the
finding
that
he
was
a
delinquent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
that
authorize
us
or
justify
us
by
setting
aside
the
judgment
finding
that
he
is
a
delinquent.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
a
denial
of
the
fundamental
constitution
right
you
would
say.
that's
the
way
he's
kept
in
jail.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
that
should
set
aside
the
finding
that
he
is
a
delinquent.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
we
should
order
him
completely
released
at
all
time
because
he
was
kept
in
a
solitary
confinement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
what
is
the
efficiency
of
the

had
to
do
with
where
he
is
kept
in
jail.
