justice
william
o.
douglas
may
i
ask
you
what
you
have
brought
up
--
you
brought
up
the
question
of
bail.
is
that
in
our
view?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
you
brought
that
up?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
no
probation?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
mr.
rezneck,
if
there
had
not
been
a
turnover
here,
the
maximum
penalty
would
have
been
the
seven
years,
would
it
not?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i
know.
if
the
juvenile
court
have
not
turned
him
over,
could
he
been
prosecuted
as
he's
now
being
prosecuted?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
right.
so
seven
years
was
the
maximum,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
whereas
if
this
indictment
is
still
good
and
it's
a
first
degree
murder
charge,
if
he's
convicted,
what's
the
penalty?
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
every
indictment
for
first
degree
murder
appealable?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
is
more
than
happening
in
the
indictment
and
the
arrest?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
how
could
that
be
possible
to
be
a
final
judgment
with
the
meaning
of
our
statute?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
you
said
that
that
would
be
a
final
judgment.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
am
sorry.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
bind
over
be
it
more
than
just
an
--
the
result
of
an
arraignment
of
the
preliminary
hearing
holding
it
--
i
don't
understand
how
you
distinguish
between
those
two,
between
the
arrest
under
the
indictment
and
the
bind
over
order.
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
finally
sees
a
federal
question
--
final
judgment
in
the
federal
sense?
justice
william
o.
douglas
we're
concerned
with
a
federal
meaning
of
the
word
final.
justice
william
o.
douglas
otherwise
we
don't
have
jurisdiction.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
i'm
talking
about
that
why
you
think
there
would
be
a
final
judgment
in
case
of
the
bind
over
because
nothing
has
happened
there
except
an
indictment
and
the
under
arrest.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
there's
nothing
more
that
the
juvenile
court
can
do
now
in
this
case.
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
you
understand
it
under
which
the
judge
decided
that
the
man
is
a
delinquent
man.
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
must
they
prove
about
it
to
prove
that
he
a
delinquent?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what's
the
standard
to
bind
over
an
adult
to
a
grand
jury
for
a
trial?
justice
william

douglas
