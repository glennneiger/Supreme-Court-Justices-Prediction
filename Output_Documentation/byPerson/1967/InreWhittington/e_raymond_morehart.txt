mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
the
prosecuting
attorney
of
fairfield
county,
ohio
and
such
represent
the
county
and
the
state
in
this
matter.
first,
i
would
like
to
elaborate
little
on
the
facts
of
this
case
as
i
believe
them
to
be.
it
was
on
the
29th
of
july
of
1966
that
gladys
willard
disappeared.
she
was,
i
think,
63
years
of
age
at
that
time.
she
was
last
seen
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
by
the
petitioner
here,
buddy
lynn
whittington.
and
from
that
time
on,
we
have
not
been
able
to
find
anyone
who
saw
gladys
willard
alive
after
that
time.
at
approximately
sometime
between
7:30
and
8:30
of
that
evening,
she
was
found
dead
in
the
whittington
home
under
the
bed
of
buddy
lynn
whittington
in
his
room.
and
she
was
under
that
part
of
the
bed
which
was
nearest
a
window
and
away
from
the
door.
now,
this
was
a
small
room
and
there
was
not
much
space
between
the
head
of
the
bed
and
the
foot
of
the
bed.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
mr.
whittington,
the
father
of
the
defendant.
that's
true.
his
son
was
with
him
at
that
time
in
the
house.
he
went
in
the
house
to
look
under
the
beds
for
her.
he
had
made
a
search
of
the
house
before
and
now
he
went
back
to
look
under
the
beds
for
this
woman
and
he
found
her
under
the
bed
of
the
defendant
buddy
lynn
whittington.
she
was
lying
on
her
back
under
the
bed.
her
dress
was
pulled
up
around
her
waist
and
her
pantie
was
pulled
down
part
way
over
her
body.
her
teeth
--
her
false
teeth
was
lying
beside
her
and
her
eyeglasses
was
lying
beside
of
her.
her
hairnet
was
lying
beside
of
her
and
her
shoes
were
off.
the
coroner
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
the
cause
of
death
was
due
to
asphyxiation
from
strangulation.
and
in
addition
to
that,
she
suffered,
i
think,
four
or
five
broken
ribs.
she
had
hematoma
of
the
scalp
indicating
that
she
had
been
hit
over
the
head,
and
the
coroner
estimated
later
that
she
had
been
dead
approximately
12
hours.
he
also
said
that
she
had
been
in
this
position
for
a
length
of
time
due
to
the
livor
mortis
of
the
body
that
was
apparent
then.
an
autopsy
was
made
of
this
woman,
and
they
gave
us
the
cause
of
death
as
i
have
previously
stated
here.
in
addition
to
that,
the
contents
of
her
stomach
revealed,
according
to
the
pathologist
who
performed
the
autopsy
that
she
had
died
within
one
and
a
half
to
three
hours
after
she
had
consumed
the
food
that
was
then
in
her
stomach.
now
prior
to
this
time,
we
had
ascertained
the
time
when
she
had
eaten
this
food.
so
i
mean
this
was
learned
later
as
to
what
the
contents
of
the
stomach
disclosed.
we
had
learned
that
she
had
eaten
breakfast
at
a
quarter
to
six
and
that
she
had
a
dry
wheat
cereal
for
breakfast.
and
that
this
food
was
consistent
with
what
the
pathologist
found
to
have
been
nearly
digested.
and
that
it
was
he
said
from
one
and
a
half
to
three
hours
after
she
had
ingested
this
food
--
after
she
had
taken
this
food
which
would
then
place
the
cause
of
death
or
the
time
of
death
some
place
between
probably
8:00
or
8:30
or
a
little
after
8:30
within
those
limits
--
this
would
also
be
in
line
with
what
the
coroner
found
to
have
been
the
time
of
death.
now,
when
she
was
--
of
course
the
authorities
recall.
and
the
chief
of
the
police
of
the
village
of
baltimore
which
is
a
small
village
of
approximately
2500
population,
and
there's
only
one
policeman
there
and
he
is
called
the
chief
of
police.
the
sheriff's
office
was
called
and
i
was
called
as
prosecuting
attorney.
and
later
then
the
juvenile
court
officer
was
called
a
photographer
was
called
to
make
pictures
which
is
our
usual
procedure.
a
number
of
questions
were
asked
--
i
think
everybody
around
there
was
questioned
including
the
neighbors
who
were
there
and
there
were
a
lot
of
people.
the
folks
were
probably
in
a
small
town
something
like
this
happens
you
have
quite
a
bit
of
difficulty
keeping
people
out.
the
neighbors
were
questioned.
mr.
whittington
and
his
--
not
mr.
whittington,
but
mr.
willard
and
his
son
who
was
living
with
them
were
questioned.
their
families
which
lived
next
door
to
them
were
questioned.
mr.
and
mrs.
whittington
and
whittington
boy
were
questioned.
this
is
a
question
he
was
referred
to
here.
they
were
questioned
that
night
concerning
what
had
happened.
no
one
was
accused
of
anything.
no
one
was
arrested.
no
one
was
taken
into
custody.
and
the
statement
i
think
is
in
air
when
they
said
that
the
premises
of
the
whittington's
were
under
control
of
the
police.
they
were
in
control
again
so
far
as
they
would
not
permit
anyone
else
in
the
premises.
that's
true.
but
at
no
time
mr.
whittington
was
told
they
had
to
stay
there
or
that
they
could
not
leave.
so
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
either
any
of
the
whittington's
or
buddy
whittington,
the
petitioner
here,
was
not
in
custody.
he
was
not
taken
into
custody
and
he
was
not
taken
into
custody
until
almost
a
week
later
which
would
have
been
the
5th
of
august
when
a
warrant
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
as
near
as
i
can
tell
you,
the
defendant
said
that
--
you
see,
he
was
at
home
this
day
and
his
parents
left
to
go
to
canton
to
visit
some
relatives.
my
understanding
is,
this
was
the
first
time
he'd
ever
been
left
alone.
and
he
was
left
there
because
he
was
going
to
summer
school.
and
he
was
supposed
to
be
at
school
at
8:30.
now,
he
did
not
go
to
school
that
day.
and
the
reason
he
gave
for
not
going
to
school
was
that
he
had
contracted
a
stomach
ache
of
some
kind.
and
he
said
that
he
spent
the
time
in
on
his
bed
playing
the
record
player.
i
believe
the
statement
was
that
he
made.
he
said
that
he
was
around
the
house
all
morning
until
sometime
after
12
o'clock,
when
a
lady
who
was
mrs.
willard's
sister
came
to
look
for
her
because
they
had
an
appointment
to
go
to
town
that
day,
and
when
she
didn't
show
up
after
so
long
a
time
she
came
to
look
for
her.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
true,
yes.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
true.
that
is
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that
is
what
the
chief
of
police
testified
to
the
day
â€“
i
believe
on
the
table
or
a
chair.
i
don't
recall
--
at
the
present
time.
and
after
this
time
that
when
mrs.
goodrich
who
was
the
sister,
came
to
the
home
and
she
fixed
the
time
at
somewhat
after
12
o'clock
that
day,
she
came
to
the
home
to
inquire
about
her
sister
because
she
thought
this
is
where
the
people
lived
that
her
sister
frequently
went
berry
picking
with.
this
was
the
time
when
blackberries
arrived.
and
she
came
there
to
inquire.
and
after
that,
she
went
to
another
place,
another
neighbor
of
mrs.
willard.
and
mrs.
goodrich
and
her
husband
and
this
neighbor
went
out
the
place
to
where
they
were
known
to
have
picked
blackberries
and
they
searched
for
mrs.
willard.
in
fact,
the
defendant
here
joined
in
that
search
later
in
the
afternoon,
through
the
brambles
and
places
where
they
were
known
to
pick
blackberries
in
search
of
her.
and
they
kept
up
the
search
including
some
people
from
the
boy
scouts
and
so
forth
of
the
community
there
who
came
in
to
look
for
her,
and
they
kept
up
the
search
until
dusk.
and
being
at
that
time
here
that
it
was,
of
course,
the
days
were
raw.
and
it
was
shortly
after
this
that
the
whittingtons'
came
home
i
think
about
7:30
if
my
memory
serves
me
correct.
and
it
was
sometime
after
this
that
the
search
was
made
at
the
house
and
she
was
found.
now,
as
i
said
before
on
the
--
about
seven
days
afterwards,
this
was
the
29th
of
july.
and
about
seven
days
afterwards
on
the
5th
of
august,
a
warrant
was
issued
for
the
arrest
of
buddy
lynn
whittington.
this
complaint,
what
we
call
a
complaint
in
the
state
of
ohio
where
it
involves
a
juvenile,
was
sworn
to
by
the
chief
of
police
of
the
village
baltimore
and
was
filed
with
the
juvenile
court
of
our
county.
on
the
basis
of
that
complaint,
a
warrant
was
issued
and
he
was
taken
into
custody.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
the
juvenile
judge
is
a
separate
court
but
it
has
--
he
is
also
the
probate
judge.
but
our
statute
provides
that
he
must
have
a
separate
court
to
hear
cases
of
juveniles
which
our
court
does
have.
i
mean
separate
apart
from
the
probate
court.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that
is
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that
is
true.
now,
on
the
same
date,
the
5th
of
august,
buddy
lynn
whittington
was
brought
into
custody,
and
was
taken
into
custody,
and
was
brought
before
the
probate
judge.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
oh
yes.
yes
indeed.
when
i
say
a
probate
judge,
i
should
say
juvenile
judge
in
this
case.
he
is
the
same
person
but
he
is
the
juvenile
judge.
yes
indeed
sir.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
they
are
at
the
present
time,
although
i
think
there
is
a
grandfather
clause
and
i
am
not
sure
whether
there
is
any
left
of
not
anymore
who
may
not
be
lawyers.
there
was
a
day
when
it
was
not
necessary
but
as
of
the
present
time,
that
is
true.
they
are
required
to
be.
on
the
same
date,
he
had
counsel
who
registered
in
that
juvenile
court
as
representing
buddy
lynn
whittington.
that
was
mr.
supman
and
mr.
kistler
here
who
have
represented
mr.
whittington
since
that
time,
and
they
went
on
record
as
being
his
counsel
as
of
that
day.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
when
the
juvenile
judge
finally
had
a
hearing
in
which
he
was
bound
over
to
the
common
pleas
court.
our
statute
provides
that
the
judge
shall
if
he
binds
him
over,
he
shall
fix
bond
for
his
reconnaissance
at
the
next
term
of
the
common
pleas
court.
the
bond
was
fixed.
he
was
released
until
such
--
until
the
time
when
he
indicted
by
the
grand
jury.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
it
was
about
not
right
on.
i
think
that
he
was
--
the
actual
order
of
transfer
i
think
went
on
april
the
24th
of
1967.
the
grand
jury
met
in
may
of
the
next
term
of
the
common
pleas
court
grand
jury
met
in
may.
he
was
indicted
and
after
he
was
served
with
the
indictment,
he
was
taken
into
custody
because
he
was
indicted
for
the
crime
of
murder
in
a
first
degree.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
yes
sir.
now
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that
is
true.
now
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no
sir.
our
law
gives
the
juvenile
judge
all
kind
of
authority.
the
law
says
--
our
statute
says
that
the
juvenile
judge
when
the
person
is
arrested
on
a
complaint,
he
shall
be
brought
before
the
court.
and
the
law
says
that
the
juvenile
judge
may
release
into
the
parents.
he
may
place
him
in
the
foster
home.
he
may
place
him
in
the
hands
of
a
probation
officer
or
he
may
detain
them.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
because
the
only
thing
i
know
is
that
that's
what
our
statute
serves,
to
judge.
the
only
thing
i
know
is
that
that's
what
the
statute
says
that
our
judge
shall
do.
now,
if
it
was
to
be
argued
that
the
court
maybe
abused
its
discretion
and
not
releasing
him
to
his
parents
or
somebody
else.
that's
what's
on
the
record
but
the
judge
you
said
that
at
the
time
and
on
these
motions
for
bails,
the
judge
said
that
this
was
not
a
popularity
contest,
and
he
had
a
duty
to
protect
the
people
of
the
state
of
ohio
and
he
owed
a
duty
to
this
boy.
that's
what
the
judge
said.
that
was
what
the
judge
said
at
that
time.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
could
he
have?
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
he
was
released
but
the
bond
was
fixed
by
the
juvenile
court.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
by
the
juvenile
court.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
well,
our
statute
says
that
if
he
transfers
him
to
the
common
pleas
court
that
he
must
fix
bond.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
he
had
no
discretion
then.
i
don't
think
he
had
any
discretion
at
all
because
the
statute
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
well,
you'll
understand.
it
is
true
that
the
specific
act
that
he
was
charged
within
a
juvenile
court
if
it
were
not
the
adult,
would
constitute
second
degree
murder.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
right.
and
of
course
under
the
indictment
for
first
degree
murder,
he
is
not
subject
to
bail
in
the
state
of
ohio.
now,
let
me
say
one
thing
further
here,
that
this
boy
â€“
a
hearing
after
this
boy
being
a
delinquent,
was
held
on
september
the
2nd
of
1966.
this
was
a
very
short
period
of
time
after
the
warrant
had
been
issued
for
his
arrest
and
of
course
there
were
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that
is
true.
we
knew
some
things
at
the
time
the
grand
jury
witness
had
did,
that
was
not
known
at
that
time
that
this
affidavit
was
filed
--
complaint
was
filed
in
the
juvenile
court.
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
a
petition
to
do
so?
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no
sir.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
this
came
about
because
the
discretion
given
to
the
juvenile
court.
the
juvenile
court
under
2151.26
which
you
quote
earlier
of
the
juvenile
court
act
says,
that
if
the
court
finds
that
he
has
committed
in
that
which
would
be
a
felony
that's
committed
by
an
adult.
after
he
makes
a
thorough
investigation
and
after
he
causes
a
mental
and
physical
examination
to
be
made,
he
shall
then
transfer
at
the
common
pleas
court
or
he
may
retain
it
and
dispose
of
it
as
a
juvenile.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no
sir.
i'll
tell
you
that
that's
true.
i
don't
know
of
anyone.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
he
couldn't
do
so.
he
was
restrained
from
doing
so
by
the
courts
of
appeal.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
right.
that's
true.
you
see
this
from
the
time
that
this
was
heard
on
september
2nd
until
april,
this
had
been
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
also
been
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
ohio.
and
after
the
supreme
court
refuse
then
to
take
jurisdiction
and
hear
it
on
its
merit
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
ohio,
they
granted
a
further
extension
of
20
days
time
and
which
tied
the
hands
of
the
juvenile
judge
as
far
as
binding
was
concerned.
and
it
was
only
when
this
court
refused
to
issue
a
further
stay
of
execution
that
the
juvenile
judge
was
permitted
to
act
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
true.
that
is
true.
the
juvenile
judges
finding
--
it
cannot
be
considered
in
any
other
court
under
our
law.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
juvenile
diagnostic
research
center.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that
is
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
right.
the
appeal
before
this
court
right
now.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
he
would
have
ruled
on
it
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
yes
it
is.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
i
think
that
it
is
and
i
maintain.
and
i
have
maintained
in
my
brief
that
the
order
appeal
from
here
is
not
a
final
order.
and
i
argue
that
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
right.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
right.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
true.
i
think
the
finding
of
under
our
statute
it
makes
the
finding
of
the
juvenile
judge
that
a
person
is
delinquent.
it
is
an
appealable
order.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
all
right.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
yes
sir.
that
is
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
i
think
that
is
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
true.
but
it
is
not
before
this
court
because
the
appeal
was
taken
before,
you
see.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that
is
true
that's
why
i
say
--
it
was
not
fine
order
from
the
court
of
appeals
but
the
court
of
appeals
wouldn't
listen.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
after
the
review
was
sought
here?
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
just
as
soon
as
this
court
refused
to
issue
a
state
of
execution
further,
the
juvenile
court
then
had
a
hearing
and
bound
him
over.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
i
don't
know
where
to
--
i
forget
what
was
said
there
that
--
i
don't
remember.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
yes
they
did.
it's
still
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
our
county.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that
is
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
in
my
opinion,
that
is
a
final
order.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
i
think
that
is
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
our
county,
the
fifth
district
court
of
appeals,
fairfield
county.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that
has
been
stayed
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
in
fact,
there
are
three
appeals
in
this
case
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
fairfield
county.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
sir?
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
one
is
an
appeal
from
the
bind
over.
the
second
one
is
an
appeal
for
the
failure
of
the
county's
court
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
and
the
third
one
is
the
refusal
of
the
common
pleas
court
to
fix
bond
on
the
first
degree
murder
charge.
those
three
appeals
are
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
at
the
present
time.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
yes
he
is.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
right.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
his
bail
was
cancelled
because
he
was
indicted
for
first
degree
murder.
and
that
is
not
bailable
under
the
laws
of
our
state
at
the
present
time.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no,
an
indictment
is
not.
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
nothing.
in
fact,
he
has
not
even
fled
to
the
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
i
don't
think
that
it
is.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
there
is
a
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
yes,
a
question
--
that's
the
final
order
but
the
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no,
no,
i
do
not
think
so
sir.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
right.
i
consider
the
bind
over
under
our
statutes
of
being
the
final
order
--
an
appeal.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
right.
that's
in
the
court
of
the
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
i
distinguish
it
on
this
basis,
sir.
as
you
know
or
may
not
know
but
in
our
state
you
cannot
appeal
in
a
criminal
case
from
a
jury
verdict.
the
appeal
is
from
the
judgment
and
sentence
of
the
court.
now,
you
may
have
several
intermediate
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
yes,
i
think
that
is
true
and
i
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
well,
i
think
that
this
is
what
we're
arguing
here
that
there
is
in
that
jurisdiction.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
there's
nothing
more
after
the
bind
over
for
the
juvenile
court
to
do.
you
see,
he
is
disposed
off
the
manner.
he
is
bounded
over
to
common
pleas
court
or
he
has
made
other
disposition.
suppose
for
instance
that
he
had
not
bounded
over
to
the
common
pleas
court
which
he
did
not
have
to
do,
he
could
then
do
number
of
other
things.
he
could
place
him
on
probation
under
our
law
or
he
could
sentence
him
to
the
youth
commission.
now
if
he
is
sentencing
to
the
youth
commission,
he
loses
jurisdiction.
our
juvenile
court
does
under
our
law.
he
loses
jurisdiction.
the
youth
commission,
the
ohio
youth
commission
can
turn
him
absolutely
scratch
free
within
30
days
if
they
want
to
do
that.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
true
when
he
binds
him
over,
to
my
opinion,
that's
a
final
order.
he
is
through
but
he
was
not
through
when
he
made
--
when
this
entry
went
on
because
he
ordered
him
to
the
--
which
he
was
required
to
do
for
physical
and
mental
examination
and
for
investigation
and
the
causes
continue
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
yes.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
they
didn't
entertain
the
appeal.
they
dismissed
it
because
of
a
no
constitutional
question
at
all
so
they
did
not
hear
it.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
they
overruled
my
motion
to
dismiss
because
there's
not
being
a
final
order.
that
is
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
and
that
i
think
they
were
wrong.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
our
contention.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
oh
yes,
it
had
to.
this
court
does.
sure
it
did.
this
is
--
that's
when
the
court
makes
his
decision
as
to
whether
the
bind
over
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no,
it
didn't
find
anything
more
in
that
regard.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
well,
the
court
--
the
court
found
based
upon
the
investigation
of
the
juvenile
diagnostic
center
that
this
boy
was
not
mentally
ill.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no,
it
won't
be
because
this
was
afterwards
you
see
--
this
was
afterwards.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
sir?
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
yes,
we
do
sir.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
it
would
be
a
final
order
but
it
would
not
be
an
appeal
of
an
order
in
our
state.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
with
that,
i
think
there's
nothing
--
there's
no
difference.
i
quite
agree
with
you
that
that
would
be
a
final
order
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
i
didn't
follow
you
sir.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
yes,
he
does
have.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
under
our
statute,
the
juvenile
court
has
original,
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
all
juveniles.
and
a
juvenile
in
our
state
is
defined
as
the
person
being
under
the
age
of
18
years.
our
statute
also
says
that
a
child
cannot
be
found
guilty
of
a
crime
in
the
juvenile
court
because
he
can
only
be
charged
with
being
a
delinquent
child
in
the
juvenile
court.
that's
all.
the
statute
also
gives
our
juvenile
court
exclusive,
original
jurisdiction
over
neglected,
crippled
or
dependent
children
as
well
as
delinquent
children.
it's
all
covered
under
the
same
statute.
so
that
if
a
person
is
charged
with
a
crime
--
for
instance,
suppose
a
17-year-old
child
would
be
charge
with
a
crime
like
in
a
municipal
court
or
police
court
and
if
you
brought
it
to
the
attention
of
the
authorities
that
he
was
under
18
years
of
age,
that
would
have
to
be
immediately
transferred
to
the
juvenile
court
of
the
residence
of
the
dependent.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no,
no,
it
doesn't
deprive
the
child
of
that
right
because
the
child
or
no
one
else
has
any
as
you
say
so
except
the
juvenile
court
in
cases
of
a
felony.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
right.
that
is
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
my
opinion
is
that
it
would
vacate
the
indictment
unless
of
course,
the
ruling
of
this
court
will
be
such
as
to
say
that
the
juvenile
court
out
of
the
state
of
ohio
were
unconstitutional.
if
that
we're
true
then
i
suppose
it
would
be
the
juvenile
where
he
was
before
that
time,
which
would
be
the
same
as
any
other
individual.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
right.
i
assume
that
to
be
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
apart
from
that.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
i
assume
that
to
be
true.
now,
that
is
my
understanding
of
the
law
at
this
time.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
well,
only
in
the
common
pleas
court
from
the
indictment
and
not
in
the
juvenile
court.
that
is
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
i
know
of
no
case
in
where
they've
held
that
if
you
have
a
right
to
bail
on
a
first
degree
murder
charge.
that's
true.
that's
my
opinion
of
the
law.
yes
sir.
i
at
this
time
--
now,
we
have
said
in
our
brief
and
we
have
argued
here
that
the
juvenile
court
--
that
a
person
charged
in
a
juvenile
court
that
is
a
--
a
juvenile
is
not
entitled
into
a
trial
by
jury.
our
statute
in
the
state
of
ohio
provides
that
the
juvenile
judge
shall
hear
the
case
informally
against
any
child,
not
only
delinquent
but
any
neglected
or
crippled
child.
he
shall
hear
this
informally
as
possible
giving
of
course
the
defendant
the
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel.
the
right
to
summon
witnesses
of
course
and
the
right
to
cross-examination,
and
that
statute
now
provides
that
an
appeal
shall
be
made.
and
we
have
always
assumed
that
that
would
include
the
right
to
make
a
transcript
or
a
record
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
well,
if
he
would
have
been
in
the
adult
court
until
such
time
as
he
was
indicted
by
the
grand
jury
for
first
degree
murder.
he
would
have
been
eligible
for
a
bond
because
he
hadn't
been
an
adult.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that
is
true
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
he
could
have
been.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no,
i
don't
think
the
discretion
would
have
been
the
same
to
be
fair
with
you
and
honest
with
you,
because
i
think
a
person
charged
with
only
a
second
degree
murder
and
our
state
courts
as
an
adult
is
entitled
to
bail.
now,
it's
a
question
then
whether
or
not
he
would
be
a
lot
better
off
as
a
juvenile
because
the
court
could
release
him
without
bond
if
he
wanted
to.
he
could
release
him
to
his
parents.
he
could
release
him
to
another
custodian.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that
is
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
right.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
the
fact
that
he
was
now
--
in
this
individual
case,
i
suppose
that
you
would
have
to
say
that
it
was
disadvantage
if
he
was
being
held
when
he
could
have
been
released
to
parents
or
probation
officer
or
to
someone
else.
that's
true
and
i
suppose
each
individual
case
would
have
to
depend
entirely
upon
the
merits
and
upon
the
judge
as
he
saw
fit.
now,
if
the
judge
abused
the
discretion,
there
is
always
an
appeal
from
that.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
well
from
a
practical
standpoint,
he
was
not
held
like
an
adult
would
be.
he
was
not
confined
in
an
adult
jail.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
well,
he
was
not
confined
in
a
--
he
was
confined
in
the
jail
but
not
where
they
keep
other
adults.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
and
he
was
not
held
in
solitary
confinement
at
no
time.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
and
they
will
find
that
the
record
is
close.
his
mother
testified
in
one
of
this
hearing
that
she
was
permitted
to
see
the
child
at
anytime
or
she
and
her
husband
that
he
had
a
television
set
in
the
room
where
he
was.
and
that
he
had
magazines
to
read
if
he
wanted
to
read
that.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
i
know
of
no
such
thing
and
i
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that
does
appear
and
there
is
no
basis
for
it
that
he
was
ever
sentenced
or
kept
in
solitary
confinement.
if
ever
he
was
alone
is
because
there
was
no
other
juveniles
to
be
confined
with
him
and
of
course
you
can't
go
out
on
the
street
and
arrest
juveniles
just
to
have
company
for
someone
that's
there.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
it
was
a
juvenile
facility
session
we
had
at
that
time
which
is
in
upstairs
over
what
our
county
jail
is.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no
sir,
this
is
the
second
floor.
we
only
had
two
floors.
now
since
that
time,
our
commissioners
have
built
a
new
jail
and
i
assure
you
that
it's
been
necessary
for
years
and
years
and
he
is
confined
in
different
quarters
now
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no
sir.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no
sir.
not
under
our
law.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
right.
that
is
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no.
i
assume
not
any
procedure
right
that
an
adult
would
not
receive.
i
think
if
that
is
true.
but
now
of
course
since
that
he
has
been
transferred
by
the
juvenile
court
to
the
common
pleas
court
then
of
course
he
is
immediately
closed
with
all
the
rights
that
an
adult
would
have.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
sir?
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
because
he
has
been
transferred
to
the
common
pleas
court
and
there
he
will
be
treated
as
an
adult.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
he
is
the
exact
same
person
but
he
is
not
charged
with
a
crime
before
he
was
caught.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no,
i
don't
think
that
it
makes
it
better.
i
don't
think
so
at
all.
i
think
that
he
had
a
lot
of
rights.
now
you
may
say
that
the
juvenile
court
abused
the
discretion
in
this
case,
and
maybe
that
is
true.
maybe
he
should
have
been
released.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
well,
after
the
body
was
discovered,
then
the
police
who
had
been
there
and
had
gone
home
for
dinner
was
recalled
back
of
course.
and
some
of
the
emergency
squad
were
there.
and
the
sheriff's
office
was
called.
and
they
came
there
and
i
suppose
at
some
place,
they
got
there
maybe
around
nine
o'clock
or
a
little
after
that
time
and
they
proceeded
to
make
an
investigation
to
call.
the
coroner
was
called
of
course.
pictures
were
made
of
the
body
and
of
the
room
where
the
body
was
found.
questions
were
asked,
both
of
mr.
and
mrs.
whittington
in
their
own
home
and
of
the
boy
with
the
parents
there
at
that
time.
in
fact
another
stranger
was
there.
i
happened
to
be
there
at
the
time,
and
another
person
whom
i
do
not
know.
i
assume
that
it
might
have
been
a
relative.
i
do
not
know
up
to
this
day.
i
don't
know.
the
boy
was
never
to
my
knowledge,
has
never
been
talked
to
by
an
official
since
that
time
by
an
officer.
but
it
is
our
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
sir?
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
i
don't
think
that
he
has
ever
talked
to
him
since
that
time
sir,
at
least
not
about
the
experience.
i
have
no
knowledge
sir.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
the
basis
for
the
arrest
warrant
was
the
fact
that
this
boy
was
here
and
he
admitted
that
he
had
been
here
all
the
time.
and
when
we
find
out
the
cause
of
death
from
the
pathologist
and
learned
some
more
information
about
that
fact,
we
assume
that
it
had
to
be
this
boy
that
committed
this
crime.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
i
say
that
we
assume
that
it
had
to
be
the
boy
who
committed
this
crime.
that
was
the
basis
for
a
warrant
issue
or
complaint
being
filed
in
the
juvenile
court
by
the
chief
of
police.
could
i
reserve
--
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
to
mr.
green.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
thank
you.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
the
prosecuting
attorney
of
fairfield
county,
ohio
and
such
represent
the
county
and
the
state
in
this
matter.
first,
i
would
like
to
elaborate
little
on
the
facts
of
this
case
as
i
believe
them
to
be.
it
was
on
the
29th
of
july
of
1966
that
gladys
willard
disappeared.
she
was,
i
think,
63
years
of
age
at
that
time.
she
was
last
seen
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
by
the
petitioner
here,
buddy
lynn
whittington.
and
from
that
time
on,
we
have
not
been
able
to
find
anyone
who
saw
gladys
willard
alive
after
that
time.
at
approximately
sometime
between
7:30
and
8:30
of
that
evening,
she
was
found
dead
in
the
whittington
home
under
the
bed
of
buddy
lynn
whittington
in
his
room.
and
she
was
under
that
part
of
the
bed
which
was
nearest
a
window
and
away
from
the
door.
now,
this
was
a
small
room
and
there
was
not
much
space
between
the
head
of
the
bed
and
the
foot
of
the
bed.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
mr.
whittington,
the
father
of
the
defendant.
that's
true.
his
son
was
with
him
at
that
time
in
the
house.
he
went
in
the
house
to
look
under
the
beds
for
her.
he
had
made
a
search
of
the
house
before
and
now
he
went
back
to
look
under
the
beds
for
this
woman
and
he
found
her
under
the
bed
of
the
defendant
buddy
lynn
whittington.
she
was
lying
on
her
back
under
the
bed.
her
dress
was
pulled
up
around
her
waist
and
her
pantie
was
pulled
down
part
way
over
her
body.
her
teeth
--
her
false
teeth
was
lying
beside
her
and
her
eyeglasses
was
lying
beside
of
her.
her
hairnet
was
lying
beside
of
her
and
her
shoes
were
off.
the
coroner
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
the
cause
of
death
was
due
to
asphyxiation
from
strangulation.
and
in
addition
to
that,
she
suffered,
i
think,
four
or
five
broken
ribs.
she
had
hematoma
of
the
scalp
indicating
that
she
had
been
hit
over
the
head,
and
the
coroner
estimated
later
that
she
had
been
dead
approximately
12
hours.
he
also
said
that
she
had
been
in
this
position
for
a
length
of
time
due
to
the
livor
mortis
of
the
body
that
was
apparent
then.
an
autopsy
was
made
of
this
woman,
and
they
gave
us
the
cause
of
death
as
i
have
previously
stated
here.
in
addition
to
that,
the
contents
of
her
stomach
revealed,
according
to
the
pathologist
who
performed
the
autopsy
that
she
had
died
within
one
and
a
half
to
three
hours
after
she
had
consumed
the
food
that
was
then
in
her
stomach.
now
prior
to
this
time,
we
had
ascertained
the
time
when
she
had
eaten
this
food.
so
i
mean
this
was
learned
later
as
to
what
the
contents
of
the
stomach
disclosed.
we
had
learned
that
she
had
eaten
breakfast
at
a
quarter
to
six
and
that
she
had
a
dry
wheat
cereal
for
breakfast.
and
that
this
food
was
consistent
with
what
the
pathologist
found
to
have
been
nearly
digested.
and
that
it
was
he
said
from
one
and
a
half
to
three
hours
after
she
had
ingested
this
food
--
after
she
had
taken
this
food
which
would
then
place
the
cause
of
death
or
the
time
of
death
some
place
between
probably
8:00
or
8:30
or
a
little
after
8:30
within
those
limits
--
this
would
also
be
in
line
with
what
the
coroner
found
to
have
been
the
time
of
death.
now,
when
she
was
--
of
course
the
authorities
recall.
and
the
chief
of
the
police
of
the
village
of
baltimore
which
is
a
small
village
of
approximately
2500
population,
and
there's
only
one
policeman
there
and
he
is
called
the
chief
of
police.
the
sheriff's
office
was
called
and
i
was
called
as
prosecuting
attorney.
and
later
then
the
juvenile
court
officer
was
called
a
photographer
was
called
to
make
pictures
which
is
our
usual
procedure.
a
number
of
questions
were
asked
--
i
think
everybody
around
there
was
questioned
including
the
neighbors
who
were
there
and
there
were
a
lot
of
people.
the
folks
were
probably
in
a
small
town
something
like
this
happens
you
have
quite
a
bit
of
difficulty
keeping
people
out.
the
neighbors
were
questioned.
mr.
whittington
and
his
--
not
mr.
whittington,
but
mr.
willard
and
his
son
who
was
living
with
them
were
questioned.
their
families
which
lived
next
door
to
them
were
questioned.
mr.
and
mrs.
whittington
and
whittington
boy
were
questioned.
this
is
a
question
he
was
referred
to
here.
they
were
questioned
that
night
concerning
what
had
happened.
no
one
was
accused
of
anything.
no
one
was
arrested.
no
one
was
taken
into
custody.
and
the
statement
i
think
is
in
air
when
they
said
that
the
premises
of
the
whittington's
were
under
control
of
the
police.
they
were
in
control
again
so
far
as
they
would
not
permit
anyone
else
in
the
premises.
that's
true.
but
at
no
time
mr.
whittington
was
told
they
had
to
stay
there
or
that
they
could
not
leave.
so
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
either
any
of
the
whittington's
or
buddy
whittington,
the
petitioner
here,
was
not
in
custody.
he
was
not
taken
into
custody
and
he
was
not
taken
into
custody
until
almost
a
week
later
which
would
have
been
the
5th
of
august
when
a
warrant
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
as
near
as
i
can
tell
you,
the
defendant
said
that
--
you
see,
he
was
at
home
this
day
and
his
parents
left
to
go
to
canton
to
visit
some
relatives.
my
understanding
is,
this
was
the
first
time
he'd
ever
been
left
alone.
and
he
was
left
there
because
he
was
going
to
summer
school.
and
he
was
supposed
to
be
at
school
at
8:30.
now,
he
did
not
go
to
school
that
day.
and
the
reason
he
gave
for
not
going
to
school
was
that
he
had
contracted
a
stomach
ache
of
some
kind.
and
he
said
that
he
spent
the
time
in
on
his
bed
playing
the
record
player.
i
believe
the
statement
was
that
he
made.
he
said
that
he
was
around
the
house
all
morning
until
sometime
after
12
o'clock,
when
a
lady
who
was
mrs.
willard's
sister
came
to
look
for
her
because
they
had
an
appointment
to
go
to
town
that
day,
and
when
she
didn't
show
up
after
so
long
a
time
she
came
to
look
for
her.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
true,
yes.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
true.
that
is
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that
is
what
the
chief
of
police
testified
to
the
day
â€“
i
believe
on
the
table
or
a
chair.
i
don't
recall
--
at
the
present
time.
and
after
this
time
that
when
mrs.
goodrich
who
was
the
sister,
came
to
the
home
and
she
fixed
the
time
at
somewhat
after
12
o'clock
that
day,
she
came
to
the
home
to
inquire
about
her
sister
because
she
thought
this
is
where
the
people
lived
that
her
sister
frequently
went
berry
picking
with.
this
was
the
time
when
blackberries
arrived.
and
she
came
there
to
inquire.
and
after
that,
she
went
to
another
place,
another
neighbor
of
mrs.
willard.
and
mrs.
goodrich
and
her
husband
and
this
neighbor
went
out
the
place
to
where
they
were
known
to
have
picked
blackberries
and
they
searched
for
mrs.
willard.
in
fact,
the
defendant
here
joined
in
that
search
later
in
the
afternoon,
through
the
brambles
and
places
where
they
were
known
to
pick
blackberries
in
search
of
her.
and
they
kept
up
the
search
including
some
people
from
the
boy
scouts
and
so
forth
of
the
community
there
who
came
in
to
look
for
her,
and
they
kept
up
the
search
until
dusk.
and
being
at
that
time
here
that
it
was,
of
course,
the
days
were
raw.
and
it
was
shortly
after
this
that
the
whittingtons'
came
home
i
think
about
7:30
if
my
memory
serves
me
correct.
and
it
was
sometime
after
this
that
the
search
was
made
at
the
house
and
she
was
found.
now,
as
i
said
before
on
the
--
about
seven
days
afterwards,
this
was
the
29th
of
july.
and
about
seven
days
afterwards
on
the
5th
of
august,
a
warrant
was
issued
for
the
arrest
of
buddy
lynn
whittington.
this
complaint,
what
we
call
a
complaint
in
the
state
of
ohio
where
it
involves
a
juvenile,
was
sworn
to
by
the
chief
of
police
of
the
village
baltimore
and
was
filed
with
the
juvenile
court
of
our
county.
on
the
basis
of
that
complaint,
a
warrant
was
issued
and
he
was
taken
into
custody.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
the
juvenile
judge
is
a
separate
court
but
it
has
--
he
is
also
the
probate
judge.
but
our
statute
provides
that
he
must
have
a
separate
court
to
hear
cases
of
juveniles
which
our
court
does
have.
i
mean
separate
apart
from
the
probate
court.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that
is
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that
is
true.
now,
on
the
same
date,
the
5th
of
august,
buddy
lynn
whittington
was
brought
into
custody,
and
was
taken
into
custody,
and
was
brought
before
the
probate
judge.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
oh
yes.
yes
indeed.
when
i
say
a
probate
judge,
i
should
say
juvenile
judge
in
this
case.
he
is
the
same
person
but
he
is
the
juvenile
judge.
yes
indeed
sir.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
they
are
at
the
present
time,
although
i
think
there
is
a
grandfather
clause
and
i
am
not
sure
whether
there
is
any
left
of
not
anymore
who
may
not
be
lawyers.
there
was
a
day
when
it
was
not
necessary
but
as
of
the
present
time,
that
is
true.
they
are
required
to
be.
on
the
same
date,
he
had
counsel
who
registered
in
that
juvenile
court
as
representing
buddy
lynn
whittington.
that
was
mr.
supman
and
mr.
kistler
here
who
have
represented
mr.
whittington
since
that
time,
and
they
went
on
record
as
being
his
counsel
as
of
that
day.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
when
the
juvenile
judge
finally
had
a
hearing
in
which
he
was
bound
over
to
the
common
pleas
court.
our
statute
provides
that
the
judge
shall
if
he
binds
him
over,
he
shall
fix
bond
for
his
reconnaissance
at
the
next
term
of
the
common
pleas
court.
the
bond
was
fixed.
he
was
released
until
such
--
until
the
time
when
he
indicted
by
the
grand
jury.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
it
was
about
not
right
on.
i
think
that
he
was
--
the
actual
order
of
transfer
i
think
went
on
april
the
24th
of
1967.
the
grand
jury
met
in
may
of
the
next
term
of
the
common
pleas
court
grand
jury
met
in
may.
he
was
indicted
and
after
he
was
served
with
the
indictment,
he
was
taken
into
custody
because
he
was
indicted
for
the
crime
of
murder
in
a
first
degree.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
yes
sir.
now
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that
is
true.
now
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no
sir.
our
law
gives
the
juvenile
judge
all
kind
of
authority.
the
law
says
--
our
statute
says
that
the
juvenile
judge
when
the
person
is
arrested
on
a
complaint,
he
shall
be
brought
before
the
court.
and
the
law
says
that
the
juvenile
judge
may
release
into
the
parents.
he
may
place
him
in
the
foster
home.
he
may
place
him
in
the
hands
of
a
probation
officer
or
he
may
detain
them.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
because
the
only
thing
i
know
is
that
that's
what
our
statute
serves,
to
judge.
the
only
thing
i
know
is
that
that's
what
the
statute
says
that
our
judge
shall
do.
now,
if
it
was
to
be
argued
that
the
court
maybe
abused
its
discretion
and
not
releasing
him
to
his
parents
or
somebody
else.
that's
what's
on
the
record
but
the
judge
you
said
that
at
the
time
and
on
these
motions
for
bails,
the
judge
said
that
this
was
not
a
popularity
contest,
and
he
had
a
duty
to
protect
the
people
of
the
state
of
ohio
and
he
owed
a
duty
to
this
boy.
that's
what
the
judge
said.
that
was
what
the
judge
said
at
that
time.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
could
he
have?
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
he
was
released
but
the
bond
was
fixed
by
the
juvenile
court.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
by
the
juvenile
court.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
well,
our
statute
says
that
if
he
transfers
him
to
the
common
pleas
court
that
he
must
fix
bond.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
he
had
no
discretion
then.
i
don't
think
he
had
any
discretion
at
all
because
the
statute
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
well,
you'll
understand.
it
is
true
that
the
specific
act
that
he
was
charged
within
a
juvenile
court
if
it
were
not
the
adult,
would
constitute
second
degree
murder.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
right.
and
of
course
under
the
indictment
for
first
degree
murder,
he
is
not
subject
to
bail
in
the
state
of
ohio.
now,
let
me
say
one
thing
further
here,
that
this
boy
â€“
a
hearing
after
this
boy
being
a
delinquent,
was
held
on
september
the
2nd
of
1966.
this
was
a
very
short
period
of
time
after
the
warrant
had
been
issued
for
his
arrest
and
of
course
there
were
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that
is
true.
we
knew
some
things
at
the
time
the
grand
jury
witness
had
did,
that
was
not
known
at
that
time
that
this
affidavit
was
filed
--
complaint
was
filed
in
the
juvenile
court.
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
a
petition
to
do
so?
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no
sir.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
this
came
about
because
the
discretion
given
to
the
juvenile
court.
the
juvenile
court
under
2151.26
which
you
quote
earlier
of
the
juvenile
court
act
says,
that
if
the
court
finds
that
he
has
committed
in
that
which
would
be
a
felony
that's
committed
by
an
adult.
after
he
makes
a
thorough
investigation
and
after
he
causes
a
mental
and
physical
examination
to
be
made,
he
shall
then
transfer
at
the
common
pleas
court
or
he
may
retain
it
and
dispose
of
it
as
a
juvenile.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no
sir.
i'll
tell
you
that
that's
true.
i
don't
know
of
anyone.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
he
couldn't
do
so.
he
was
restrained
from
doing
so
by
the
courts
of
appeal.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
right.
that's
true.
you
see
this
from
the
time
that
this
was
heard
on
september
2nd
until
april,
this
had
been
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
also
been
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
ohio.
and
after
the
supreme
court
refuse
then
to
take
jurisdiction
and
hear
it
on
its
merit
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
ohio,
they
granted
a
further
extension
of
20
days
time
and
which
tied
the
hands
of
the
juvenile
judge
as
far
as
binding
was
concerned.
and
it
was
only
when
this
court
refused
to
issue
a
further
stay
of
execution
that
the
juvenile
judge
was
permitted
to
act
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
true.
that
is
true.
the
juvenile
judges
finding
--
it
cannot
be
considered
in
any
other
court
under
our
law.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
juvenile
diagnostic
research
center.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that
is
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
right.
the
appeal
before
this
court
right
now.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
he
would
have
ruled
on
it
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
yes
it
is.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
i
think
that
it
is
and
i
maintain.
and
i
have
maintained
in
my
brief
that
the
order
appeal
from
here
is
not
a
final
order.
and
i
argue
that
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
right.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
right.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
true.
i
think
the
finding
of
under
our
statute
it
makes
the
finding
of
the
juvenile
judge
that
a
person
is
delinquent.
it
is
an
appealable
order.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
all
right.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
yes
sir.
that
is
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
i
think
that
is
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
true.
but
it
is
not
before
this
court
because
the
appeal
was
taken
before,
you
see.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that
is
true
that's
why
i
say
--
it
was
not
fine
order
from
the
court
of
appeals
but
the
court
of
appeals
wouldn't
listen.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
after
the
review
was
sought
here?
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
just
as
soon
as
this
court
refused
to
issue
a
state
of
execution
further,
the
juvenile
court
then
had
a
hearing
and
bound
him
over.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
i
don't
know
where
to
--
i
forget
what
was
said
there
that
--
i
don't
remember.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
yes
they
did.
it's
still
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
our
county.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that
is
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
in
my
opinion,
that
is
a
final
order.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
i
think
that
is
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
our
county,
the
fifth
district
court
of
appeals,
fairfield
county.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that
has
been
stayed
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
in
fact,
there
are
three
appeals
in
this
case
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
fairfield
county.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
sir?
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
one
is
an
appeal
from
the
bind
over.
the
second
one
is
an
appeal
for
the
failure
of
the
county's
court
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
and
the
third
one
is
the
refusal
of
the
common
pleas
court
to
fix
bond
on
the
first
degree
murder
charge.
those
three
appeals
are
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
at
the
present
time.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
yes
he
is.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
right.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
his
bail
was
cancelled
because
he
was
indicted
for
first
degree
murder.
and
that
is
not
bailable
under
the
laws
of
our
state
at
the
present
time.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no,
an
indictment
is
not.
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
nothing.
in
fact,
he
has
not
even
fled
to
the
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
i
don't
think
that
it
is.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
there
is
a
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
yes,
a
question
--
that's
the
final
order
but
the
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no,
no,
i
do
not
think
so
sir.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
right.
i
consider
the
bind
over
under
our
statutes
of
being
the
final
order
--
an
appeal.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
right.
that's
in
the
court
of
the
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
i
distinguish
it
on
this
basis,
sir.
as
you
know
or
may
not
know
but
in
our
state
you
cannot
appeal
in
a
criminal
case
from
a
jury
verdict.
the
appeal
is
from
the
judgment
and
sentence
of
the
court.
now,
you
may
have
several
intermediate
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
yes,
i
think
that
is
true
and
i
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
well,
i
think
that
this
is
what
we're
arguing
here
that
there
is
in
that
jurisdiction.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
there's
nothing
more
after
the
bind
over
for
the
juvenile
court
to
do.
you
see,
he
is
disposed
off
the
manner.
he
is
bounded
over
to
common
pleas
court
or
he
has
made
other
disposition.
suppose
for
instance
that
he
had
not
bounded
over
to
the
common
pleas
court
which
he
did
not
have
to
do,
he
could
then
do
number
of
other
things.
he
could
place
him
on
probation
under
our
law
or
he
could
sentence
him
to
the
youth
commission.
now
if
he
is
sentencing
to
the
youth
commission,
he
loses
jurisdiction.
our
juvenile
court
does
under
our
law.
he
loses
jurisdiction.
the
youth
commission,
the
ohio
youth
commission
can
turn
him
absolutely
scratch
free
within
30
days
if
they
want
to
do
that.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
true
when
he
binds
him
over,
to
my
opinion,
that's
a
final
order.
he
is
through
but
he
was
not
through
when
he
made
--
when
this
entry
went
on
because
he
ordered
him
to
the
--
which
he
was
required
to
do
for
physical
and
mental
examination
and
for
investigation
and
the
causes
continue
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
yes.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
they
didn't
entertain
the
appeal.
they
dismissed
it
because
of
a
no
constitutional
question
at
all
so
they
did
not
hear
it.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
they
overruled
my
motion
to
dismiss
because
there's
not
being
a
final
order.
that
is
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
and
that
i
think
they
were
wrong.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
our
contention.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
oh
yes,
it
had
to.
this
court
does.
sure
it
did.
this
is
--
that's
when
the
court
makes
his
decision
as
to
whether
the
bind
over
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no,
it
didn't
find
anything
more
in
that
regard.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
well,
the
court
--
the
court
found
based
upon
the
investigation
of
the
juvenile
diagnostic
center
that
this
boy
was
not
mentally
ill.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no,
it
won't
be
because
this
was
afterwards
you
see
--
this
was
afterwards.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
sir?
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
yes,
we
do
sir.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
it
would
be
a
final
order
but
it
would
not
be
an
appeal
of
an
order
in
our
state.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
with
that,
i
think
there's
nothing
--
there's
no
difference.
i
quite
agree
with
you
that
that
would
be
a
final
order
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
i
didn't
follow
you
sir.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
yes,
he
does
have.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
under
our
statute,
the
juvenile
court
has
original,
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
all
juveniles.
and
a
juvenile
in
our
state
is
defined
as
the
person
being
under
the
age
of
18
years.
our
statute
also
says
that
a
child
cannot
be
found
guilty
of
a
crime
in
the
juvenile
court
because
he
can
only
be
charged
with
being
a
delinquent
child
in
the
juvenile
court.
that's
all.
the
statute
also
gives
our
juvenile
court
exclusive,
original
jurisdiction
over
neglected,
crippled
or
dependent
children
as
well
as
delinquent
children.
it's
all
covered
under
the
same
statute.
so
that
if
a
person
is
charged
with
a
crime
--
for
instance,
suppose
a
17-year-old
child
would
be
charge
with
a
crime
like
in
a
municipal
court
or
police
court
and
if
you
brought
it
to
the
attention
of
the
authorities
that
he
was
under
18
years
of
age,
that
would
have
to
be
immediately
transferred
to
the
juvenile
court
of
the
residence
of
the
dependent.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no,
no,
it
doesn't
deprive
the
child
of
that
right
because
the
child
or
no
one
else
has
any
as
you
say
so
except
the
juvenile
court
in
cases
of
a
felony.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
right.
that
is
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
my
opinion
is
that
it
would
vacate
the
indictment
unless
of
course,
the
ruling
of
this
court
will
be
such
as
to
say
that
the
juvenile
court
out
of
the
state
of
ohio
were
unconstitutional.
if
that
we're
true
then
i
suppose
it
would
be
the
juvenile
where
he
was
before
that
time,
which
would
be
the
same
as
any
other
individual.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
right.
i
assume
that
to
be
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
apart
from
that.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
i
assume
that
to
be
true.
now,
that
is
my
understanding
of
the
law
at
this
time.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
well,
only
in
the
common
pleas
court
from
the
indictment
and
not
in
the
juvenile
court.
that
is
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
i
know
of
no
case
in
where
they've
held
that
if
you
have
a
right
to
bail
on
a
first
degree
murder
charge.
that's
true.
that's
my
opinion
of
the
law.
yes
sir.
i
at
this
time
--
now,
we
have
said
in
our
brief
and
we
have
argued
here
that
the
juvenile
court
--
that
a
person
charged
in
a
juvenile
court
that
is
a
--
a
juvenile
is
not
entitled
into
a
trial
by
jury.
our
statute
in
the
state
of
ohio
provides
that
the
juvenile
judge
shall
hear
the
case
informally
against
any
child,
not
only
delinquent
but
any
neglected
or
crippled
child.
he
shall
hear
this
informally
as
possible
giving
of
course
the
defendant
the
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel.
the
right
to
summon
witnesses
of
course
and
the
right
to
cross-examination,
and
that
statute
now
provides
that
an
appeal
shall
be
made.
and
we
have
always
assumed
that
that
would
include
the
right
to
make
a
transcript
or
a
record
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
well,
if
he
would
have
been
in
the
adult
court
until
such
time
as
he
was
indicted
by
the
grand
jury
for
first
degree
murder.
he
would
have
been
eligible
for
a
bond
because
he
hadn't
been
an
adult.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that
is
true
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
he
could
have
been.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no,
i
don't
think
the
discretion
would
have
been
the
same
to
be
fair
with
you
and
honest
with
you,
because
i
think
a
person
charged
with
only
a
second
degree
murder
and
our
state
courts
as
an
adult
is
entitled
to
bail.
now,
it's
a
question
then
whether
or
not
he
would
be
a
lot
better
off
as
a
juvenile
because
the
court
could
release
him
without
bond
if
he
wanted
to.
he
could
release
him
to
his
parents.
he
could
release
him
to
another
custodian.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that
is
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
right.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
the
fact
that
he
was
now
--
in
this
individual
case,
i
suppose
that
you
would
have
to
say
that
it
was
disadvantage
if
he
was
being
held
when
he
could
have
been
released
to
parents
or
probation
officer
or
to
someone
else.
that's
true
and
i
suppose
each
individual
case
would
have
to
depend
entirely
upon
the
merits
and
upon
the
judge
as
he
saw
fit.
now,
if
the
judge
abused
the
discretion,
there
is
always
an
appeal
from
that.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
well
from
a
practical
standpoint,
he
was
not
held
like
an
adult
would
be.
he
was
not
confined
in
an
adult
jail.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
well,
he
was
not
confined
in
a
--
he
was
confined
in
the
jail
but
not
where
they
keep
other
adults.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
and
he
was
not
held
in
solitary
confinement
at
no
time.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
and
they
will
find
that
the
record
is
close.
his
mother
testified
in
one
of
this
hearing
that
she
was
permitted
to
see
the
child
at
anytime
or
she
and
her
husband
that
he
had
a
television
set
in
the
room
where
he
was.
and
that
he
had
magazines
to
read
if
he
wanted
to
read
that.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
i
know
of
no
such
thing
and
i
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that
does
appear
and
there
is
no
basis
for
it
that
he
was
ever
sentenced
or
kept
in
solitary
confinement.
if
ever
he
was
alone
is
because
there
was
no
other
juveniles
to
be
confined
with
him
and
of
course
you
can't
go
out
on
the
street
and
arrest
juveniles
just
to
have
company
for
someone
that's
there.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
it
was
a
juvenile
facility
session
we
had
at
that
time
which
is
in
upstairs
over
what
our
county
jail
is.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no
sir,
this
is
the
second
floor.
we
only
had
two
floors.
now
since
that
time,
our
commissioners
have
built
a
new
jail
and
i
assure
you
that
it's
been
necessary
for
years
and
years
and
he
is
confined
in
different
quarters
now
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no
sir.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no
sir.
not
under
our
law.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
that's
right.
that
is
true.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no.
i
assume
not
any
procedure
right
that
an
adult
would
not
receive.
i
think
if
that
is
true.
but
now
of
course
since
that
he
has
been
transferred
by
the
juvenile
court
to
the
common
pleas
court
then
of
course
he
is
immediately
closed
with
all
the
rights
that
an
adult
would
have.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
sir?
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
because
he
has
been
transferred
to
the
common
pleas
court
and
there
he
will
be
treated
as
an
adult.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
he
is
the
exact
same
person
but
he
is
not
charged
with
a
crime
before
he
was
caught.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
no,
i
don't
think
that
it
makes
it
better.
i
don't
think
so
at
all.
i
think
that
he
had
a
lot
of
rights.
now
you
may
say
that
the
juvenile
court
abused
the
discretion
in
this
case,
and
maybe
that
is
true.
maybe
he
should
have
been
released.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
well,
after
the
body
was
discovered,
then
the
police
who
had
been
there
and
had
gone
home
for
dinner
was
recalled
back
of
course.
and
some
of
the
emergency
squad
were
there.
and
the
sheriff's
office
was
called.
and
they
came
there
and
i
suppose
at
some
place,
they
got
there
maybe
around
nine
o'clock
or
a
little
after
that
time
and
they
proceeded
to
make
an
investigation
to
call.
the
coroner
was
called
of
course.
pictures
were
made
of
the
body
and
of
the
room
where
the
body
was
found.
questions
were
asked,
both
of
mr.
and
mrs.
whittington
in
their
own
home
and
of
the
boy
with
the
parents
there
at
that
time.
in
fact
another
stranger
was
there.
i
happened
to
be
there
at
the
time,
and
another
person
whom
i
do
not
know.
i
assume
that
it
might
have
been
a
relative.
i
do
not
know
up
to
this
day.
i
don't
know.
the
boy
was
never
to
my
knowledge,
has
never
been
talked
to
by
an
official
since
that
time
by
an
officer.
but
it
is
our
--
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
sir?
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
i
don't
think
that
he
has
ever
talked
to
him
since
that
time
sir,
at
least
not
about
the
experience.
i
have
no
knowledge
sir.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
the
basis
for
the
arrest
warrant
was
the
fact
that
this
boy
was
here
and
he
admitted
that
he
had
been
here
all
the
time.
and
when
we
find
out
the
cause
of
death
from
the
pathologist
and
learned
some
more
information
about
that
fact,
we
assume
that
it
had
to
be
this
boy
that
committed
this
crime.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
i
say
that
we
assume
that
it
had
to
be
the
boy
who
committed
this
crime.
that
was
the
basis
for
a
warrant
issue
or
complaint
being
filed
in
the
juvenile
court
by
the
chief
of
police.
could
i
reserve
--
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
to
mr.
green.
mr.
e.
raymond
morehart
thank
you.
