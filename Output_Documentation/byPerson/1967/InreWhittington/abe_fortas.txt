justice
abe
fortas
how
long
did
you
say
that
this
14-year-old
boy
has
been
incarcerated?
justice
abe
fortas
oh
--
justice
abe
fortas
about
20
months.
now,
under
pursuant
to
what
sort
of
an
order,
which
court
has
he
been
confined?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
now,
let's
try
to
get
this
thing
straightened
out
and
for
my
benefit,
if
you
will.
justice
abe
fortas
the
juvenile
court
found
that
he
was
--
concluded
that
he
was
delinquent,
right?
justice
abe
fortas
the
juvenile
court
did
not
ever
pass
sentence,
did
it?
or
whatever
they
--
justice
abe
fortas
they
can
order
with
respect
to
his
disposition
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
was
that
order?
justice
abe
fortas
before
that
time,
before
the
grand
jury
proceeding,
what
did
the
juvenile
court
--
what
was
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
disposition?
justice
abe
fortas
when
was
that?
what
date
was
that?
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
thought
the
court
ordered
him
to
report
to
some
diagnostic
facility
and
it
was
while
that
order
was
in
effect
that
you
appealed,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
what
i
want
to
know
is
for
how
long
was
he
in
that
state
and
subject
to
that
order
before
the
grand
jury
indictments?
how
long
was
this
boy
incarcerated
prior
to
the
time
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
the
grand
jury
indictments,
yes.
by
the
binding
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
over
a
year.
now,
at
that
time,
there
was
no
order
of
disposition
directed
to
this
boy
by
the
juvenile
court,
except
an
order
saying
that
he
should
go
to
the
diagnostic
center,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
under
what
order
of
the
juvenile
court
was
he
held
after
he
was
returned
by
the
diagnostic
center.
that's
what
i
want
to
know
because
as
i
read
this
record,
the
only
thing
that
happened
here
was
that
the
juvenile
court
entered
an
order
saying
the
boy
was
a
delinquent,
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then,
the
juvenile
court
ordered
that
he
go
to
the
diagnostic
center,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
then
the
diagnostic
center
returned.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
court
continued
to
hold
on
to
the
boy.
now,
pursuant
to
what
order
of
the
juvenile
court,
or
can
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
juvenile
procedure?
can
the
boy
be
incarcerated
on
nothing
more
than
a
finding
of
delinquency
without
any
after
trial
or
finding
of
delinquency
without
any
order
for
his
disposition?
justice
abe
fortas
when
do
you
say
this
was
second
degree,
this
would
have
been
second
degree
murder?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
because
he
was
a
juvenile?
justice
abe
fortas
why?
if
he
was
an
adult,
if
this
crime
had
been
committed
by
an
adult,
why
would
that
have
been
second
degree
murder?
justice
abe
fortas
i
wish
you
would
address
yourself
to
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case.
i
must
confess
that
it's
quite
troublesome
because
whereas
the
character
of
view
action
by
the
juvenile
court,
juvenile
court
no
longer
has
jurisdiction
of
this
boy,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
the
boy
has
been
bound
over
to
the
adult
court.
there
had
been
an
indictment
and
first
degree
murder
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
by
the
grand
jury,
is
awaiting
trial
in
the
adult
court.
now,
how
does
that
affect
the
procedural
--
how
does
that
procedurally
affect
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
and
if
anything
we
can
do
about
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
was
the
judgment
of
those,
just
an
adjudication
of
the
boy
as
delinquent?
there
was
no
order
of
disposition
entered,
was
there?
justice
abe
fortas
for
diagnostic
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
work,
and
that's
over,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
suppose
we
agree
with
you
entirely
and
i
agree
with
you
on
everything
you've
asked
us
to
do
here.
what
happens
to
the
boy?
justice
abe
fortas
how
does
that
happen?
did
the
grand
jury
have
an
ordinary,
customary
use
of
a
grand
jury
proceeding?
justice
abe
fortas
--
indictment?
justice
abe
fortas
have
you
briefed
that?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
rezneck,
when
was
the
transfer
from
juvenile
to
adult
court
made
in
connection
with
the
proceedings
before
this
court?
was
the
transfer
made
before
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
here?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
maybe.
but
on
the
other
hand,
maybe
somewhat
like
the
verdict
of
guilty
and
no
sentence
being
imposed.
and
i'm
considering
a
case
at
that
juncture
you
see.
justice
abe
fortas
that
gault
was
specifically
limited,
wasn't
he,
mr.
rezneck,
the
situations
where
the
charge
was
something
that
in
the
case
of
an
adult
would
amount
to
the
violation
of
law.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
he
said
he
saw
mrs.
willard
came
at
the
back
door
to
return
some
curlers.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
was
about
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
curlers
were
found
in
the
kitchen
by
the
police.
justice
abe
fortas
the
common
pleas
judge
who
released
him
on
bail
after
the
transfer
--
justice
abe
fortas
did
he?
justice
abe
fortas
after
the
transfer
of
buddy
lynn
whittington
from
the
juvenile
court
to
the
adult
court
and
the
common
pleas
judge
acquired
jurisdiction
over
him,
didn't
he?
justice
abe
fortas
and
he
was
released
on
bail?
justice
abe
fortas
by
the
juvenile
court.
justice
abe
fortas
what
i
want
to
know
is
the
juvenile
court
judge
didn't
have
anymore
authority
under
the
--
after
the
boy
became
an
adult
as
a
technical
matter,
did
he?
and
he
had
when
the
boy
was
a
juvenile.
justice
abe
fortas
he
must
--
justice
abe
fortas
even
though
he
is
transferred
on
what
turned
out
to
be
a
first
degree
murder
charge.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
that's
the
way
the
complaint
read.
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
he
got
the
benefit
of
the
juvenile
court
procedure
as
transferred
to
the
adult
court,
released
on
bail
which
had
been
denied
to
him
as
--
when
he
was
getting
the
benefit
of
being
treated
as
a
juvenile
and
then
he
was
indicted
for
first
degree
murder.
justice
abe
fortas
was
the
petition
of
the
juvenile
court
to
transfer
buddy
lynn
whittington
to
the
adult
court?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
did
that
come
about?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
are
you
now
telling
us
that
nobody,
no
state
official
requested
the
judge
to
transfer
buddy
lynn
whittington
from
a
status
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
juvenile
court
to
the
adult
court?
justice
abe
fortas
why
didn't
the
judge
transfer
him
before?
justice
abe
fortas
during
that
entire
period?
justice
abe
fortas
was
the
juvenile
judge's
finding
of
delinquency
presented
to
the
grand
jury?
justice
abe
fortas
you
went
before
the
grand
jury
made
an
independent
case.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me.
i
beg
your
pardon.
your
ohio
supreme
court
entertained
an
appeal
i
suppose.
they
have
some
requirement
of
finality.
justice
abe
fortas
your
ohio
supreme
court
entertained
on
appeal
from
the
precise
judgment
or
order
or
whatever
it
is
that
we
have
for
us,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
but
your
intermediate
court
or
whatever
--
justice
abe
fortas
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
abe
fortas
and
they
have
decided
that
for
state
purposes
at
any
rate,
this
is
a
final
order.
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
you're
saying
thus
is
that,
they
were
wrong
and
we
ought
to
overrule
them
on
that
question
of
state
law
or
i
suppose
you'd
have
to
say
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
this
is
not
a
final
order.
justice
abe
fortas
even
though
the
transfer
order,
the
binding
over
order
was
self
--it
didn't
involve
any
additional
findings,
did
it?
justice
abe
fortas
what
if
the
juvenile
court
fined
that
it
hadn't
found
in
connection
with
the
delinquency.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
i'm
saying
what
makes
you
with
the
binding
over
order
where
any
findings
made
by
the
juvenile
court
in
addition
to
the
findings
that
are
before
us
right
now.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
don't
your
statute
to
provide
that
a
juvenile
has
a
right
to
proceedings
in
the
juvenile
court?
does
your
statute
say
that
or
doesn't?
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
ohio
statute
provide
that
a
juvenile
has
--
who
is
charged
with
an
offense
or
whatever
magic
language
you
use
that
he
has
a
right
to
be
proceeded
against
in
the
juvenile
court
in
the
first
instance?
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
that
here
what's
happened
is
a
necessary
and
an
adjudication
of
delinquency
that
according
to
your
adversary
anyway
was
necessary
before
the
child
could
be
deprived
of
his
right
to
be
preceded
against
in
the
juvenile
and
not
the
adult
court.
justice
abe
fortas
as
my
understanding,
what
we're
dealing
with
here
maybe
a
finding
and
an
order
by
the
juvenile
court
which
in
effect
deprives
the
child
of
a
right
given
to
him
under
ohio
law
namely,
the
right
to
be
tried
in
the
juvenile
and
not
in
the
adult
court.
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
i
understand
you
but
the
point
is,
there
has
to
be
a
juvenile
court
proceeding
first
before
the
child
can
be
tried
in
the
adult
court.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
morehart,
apart
from
the
question
of
ultimate
penalty,
what
are
the
benefits
apart
from
the
question
of
ultimate
penalty,
what
are
the
benefits
that
buddy
lynn
whittington
received
by
reason
of
being
tried
in
the
juvenile
court
as
against
what
would
have
happened
to
him
in
the
adult
court?
justice
abe
fortas
i
would
have
been
an
advantage
of
his
being
as
an
adult.
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
that's
one
thing
on
the
deficit
side
is
so
far
as
the
ohio
juvenile
court
system
is
concerned.
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
telling
us
and
we
can
pass
to
the
next
one
is
that
if
he
had
been
an
adult
and
he
had
been
charged
with
exactly
the
same
thing
under
ohio
and
had
been
charged
with
second
degree
murder.
under
ohio
law,
he
would
have
had
a
right
to
bail.
justice
abe
fortas
whereas
being
a
juvenile,
he
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
judge.
justice
abe
fortas
and
he
did
not
get
bailed.
what
submits
the
advantage
of
the
juvenile
court
procedure
for
this
boy?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
you
can
say
that
this
boy
got
--
any
benefit
he
got,
any
protection
he
got
as
a
result
of
being
processed
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
in
the
juvenile
court
as
against
being
given
the
rights
under
our
constitution
in
an
adult
court.
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
not
what
the
record
--
what
the
opinion
below
says.
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
contrary
to
what
i've
seen
somewhere
in
this
record.
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
say
that
that
isn't
true?
that
statement
is
made
here.
justice
abe
fortas
where
did
this
curious
misapprehension
that
i
can't
spot
it
at
the
moment.
what's
the
basis
of
these
curious
statements
in
the
papers
before
us?
number
one
that
the
boy
was
kept
along
with
adult
prisoners,
number
two,
that
for
a
prolonged
period
of
time,
he
was
kept
in
solitary
confinement.
justice
abe
fortas
you
know
that
does
appear.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
this
boy
was
not
put
in
a
special
juvenile
facility
was
he?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
the
eighth
floor
facility?
justice
abe
fortas
are
there
any
other
benefits
that
this
boy
received
by
reason
of
the
ohio
juvenile
court
procedures?
justice
abe
fortas
well
apart
from
words
what
actually
happened
to
the
boy
here,
was
he
given
any
procedural
rights
that
he
would
not
get
as
an
adult?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
was
the
basis
then
for
the
arrest
warrant?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
now
that
the
boy
had
been
an
adult
or
instead
of
being
permitted
to
the
discretion
of
the
juvenile
court
judge,
he
had
been
an
adult
charged
with
second
degree
murder.
he
would
then
have
had
a
right
to
bail
regardless
of
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
is
there
anything
else
that
--
this
boy.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
tell
me
what
could
have
accrued
to
his
benefit
once
we
pass
this
debate
about
what
the
judge
might
have
done
that
he
didn't
do
with
respect
to
the
release.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
nothing
in
this
record.
justice
abe
fortas
let's
don't
assume
that.
let's
talk
about
this
boy.
justice
abe
fortas
maybe
too
much
lowing
at
the
wrong
time
and
maybe
not
enough
lowing
in
terms
of
basic
structure.
what
would
you
say
to
that
mr.
green?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
disagree
with
the
constitutional
principle
that
provides
for
a
right
to
bail?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
like
that
happened
here
so
far
as
this
record
shows?
justice
abe
fortas
what
happened
here?
justice
abe
fortas
what
happened
here
in
effect
was
an
effort
by
the
juvenile
court
to
find
out
whether
this
boy
committed
the
offense.
this
terrible
crime
with
what
he
was
charged
in
substance
if
not
in
words.
and
when
it
had
for
that
purpose
and
without
any
of
these
attempts
that
we
all
talk
about
in
connection
with
the
juvenile
court,
to
find
out
what
kind
of
boy
he
is,
what
makes
him
take
and
what's
the
best
thing
to
do
with
him,
isn't
that
so?
justice
abe
fortas
where
do
you
find
that
in
--
where
do
you
find
anything
else
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
in
your
brief,
you
referred
to
that
as
shameful
incarceration
of
this
boy.
justice
abe
fortas
shameful
treatment.
justice
abe
fortas
on
the
presence
of
substantial
--
justice
abe
fortas
without
weighing
it.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
rezneck,
mr.
morehart
challenged
the
statement
that's
been
made
about
a
boy
being
confined
and
along
with
adult
and
being
in
solitary
confinement.
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
abe
fortas
that
was
after
a
personal
viewing
by
the
court.
justice
abe
fortas
well
mr.
rezneck,
it
has
been
urged
before
us
in
this
case
and
it's
been
otherwise
urged
that
the
state
has
a
burden
of
showing
that
the
classification
of
children
for
purposes
of
various
applications
of
its
laws
is
a
reasonable
one
and
in
terms
of
justification
of
denial
of
certain
rights,
certain
constitutional
rights.
and
it's
been
urged
that
for
the
state
to
bear
that
first,
it's
got
to
show
a
wide
range
of
factors
to
indicate
that
the
classification
is
reasonable.
and
among
those
factors
is
the
question
of
what
the
state
does
with
respect
to
the
child.
it
makes
it
reasonable
for
the
state
to
classify
the
child
separately
and
differently
with
respect
to
the
administration
of
its
law
of
offenses
including
their
things
of
which
juveniles
are
charged.
and
from
that
point
of
view,
it's
urged
that
the
question
of
facilities
or
no
facilities
available
for
special
treatment
of
juveniles
is
relevant
to
the
constitutional
question.
the
state
that
to
you
not
to
reflect
my
own
view
on
it
because
i
don't
at
the
moment
have
a
view
on
that
but
as
making
quite
relevant,
as
an
argument,
that
would
if
valid
to
make
quite
relevant
to
the
question
of
what
does
the
state
do
with
respect
to
juveniles
to
justify
the
separate
classification
in
this
separate
system
of
jurisprudence,
that
it
can
be
so
called.
justice
abe
fortas
how
long
did
you
say
that
this
14-year-old
boy
has
been
incarcerated?
justice
abe
fortas
oh
--
justice
abe
fortas
about
20
months.
now,
under
pursuant
to
what
sort
of
an
order,
which
court
has
he
been
confined?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
now,
let's
try
to
get
this
thing
straightened
out
and
for
my
benefit,
if
you
will.
justice
abe
fortas
the
juvenile
court
found
that
he
was
--
concluded
that
he
was
delinquent,
right?
justice
abe
fortas
the
juvenile
court
did
not
ever
pass
sentence,
did
it?
or
whatever
they
--
justice
abe
fortas
they
can
order
with
respect
to
his
disposition
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
was
that
order?
justice
abe
fortas
before
that
time,
before
the
grand
jury
proceeding,
what
did
the
juvenile
court
--
what
was
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
disposition?
justice
abe
fortas
when
was
that?
what
date
was
that?
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
thought
the
court
ordered
him
to
report
to
some
diagnostic
facility
and
it
was
while
that
order
was
in
effect
that
you
appealed,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
what
i
want
to
know
is
for
how
long
was
he
in
that
state
and
subject
to
that
order
before
the
grand
jury
indictments?
how
long
was
this
boy
incarcerated
prior
to
the
time
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
the
grand
jury
indictments,
yes.
by
the
binding
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
over
a
year.
now,
at
that
time,
there
was
no
order
of
disposition
directed
to
this
boy
by
the
juvenile
court,
except
an
order
saying
that
he
should
go
to
the
diagnostic
center,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
under
what
order
of
the
juvenile
court
was
he
held
after
he
was
returned
by
the
diagnostic
center.
that's
what
i
want
to
know
because
as
i
read
this
record,
the
only
thing
that
happened
here
was
that
the
juvenile
court
entered
an
order
saying
the
boy
was
a
delinquent,
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then,
the
juvenile
court
ordered
that
he
go
to
the
diagnostic
center,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
then
the
diagnostic
center
returned.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
court
continued
to
hold
on
to
the
boy.
now,
pursuant
to
what
order
of
the
juvenile
court,
or
can
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
juvenile
procedure?
can
the
boy
be
incarcerated
on
nothing
more
than
a
finding
of
delinquency
without
any
after
trial
or
finding
of
delinquency
without
any
order
for
his
disposition?
justice
abe
fortas
when
do
you
say
this
was
second
degree,
this
would
have
been
second
degree
murder?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
because
he
was
a
juvenile?
justice
abe
fortas
why?
if
he
was
an
adult,
if
this
crime
had
been
committed
by
an
adult,
why
would
that
have
been
second
degree
murder?
justice
abe
fortas
i
wish
you
would
address
yourself
to
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case.
i
must
confess
that
it's
quite
troublesome
because
whereas
the
character
of
view
action
by
the
juvenile
court,
juvenile
court
no
longer
has
jurisdiction
of
this
boy,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
the
boy
has
been
bound
over
to
the
adult
court.
there
had
been
an
indictment
and
first
degree
murder
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
by
the
grand
jury,
is
awaiting
trial
in
the
adult
court.
now,
how
does
that
affect
the
procedural
--
how
does
that
procedurally
affect
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
and
if
anything
we
can
do
about
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
was
the
judgment
of
those,
just
an
adjudication
of
the
boy
as
delinquent?
there
was
no
order
of
disposition
entered,
was
there?
justice
abe
fortas
for
diagnostic
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
work,
and
that's
over,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
suppose
we
agree
with
you
entirely
and
i
agree
with
you
on
everything
you've
asked
us
to
do
here.
what
happens
to
the
boy?
justice
abe
fortas
how
does
that
happen?
did
the
grand
jury
have
an
ordinary,
customary
use
of
a
grand
jury
proceeding?
justice
abe
fortas
--
indictment?
justice
abe
fortas
have
you
briefed
that?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
rezneck,
when
was
the
transfer
from
juvenile
to
adult
court
made
in
connection
with
the
proceedings
before
this
court?
was
the
transfer
made
before
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
here?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
maybe.
but
on
the
other
hand,
maybe
somewhat
like
the
verdict
of
guilty
and
no
sentence
being
imposed.
and
i'm
considering
a
case
at
that
juncture
you
see.
justice
abe
fortas
that
gault
was
specifically
limited,
wasn't
he,
mr.
rezneck,
the
situations
where
the
charge
was
something
that
in
the
case
of
an
adult
would
amount
to
the
violation
of
law.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
he
said
he
saw
mrs.
willard
came
at
the
back
door
to
return
some
curlers.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
was
about
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
curlers
were
found
in
the
kitchen
by
the
police.
justice
abe
fortas
the
common
pleas
judge
who
released
him
on
bail
after
the
transfer
--
justice
abe
fortas
did
he?
justice
abe
fortas
after
the
transfer
of
buddy
lynn
whittington
from
the
juvenile
court
to
the
adult
court
and
the
common
pleas
judge
acquired
jurisdiction
over
him,
didn't
he?
justice
abe
fortas
and
he
was
released
on
bail?
justice
abe
fortas
by
the
juvenile
court.
justice
abe
fortas
what
i
want
to
know
is
the
juvenile
court
judge
didn't
have
anymore
authority
under
the
--
after
the
boy
became
an
adult
as
a
technical
matter,
did
he?
and
he
had
when
the
boy
was
a
juvenile.
justice
abe
fortas
he
must
--
justice
abe
fortas
even
though
he
is
transferred
on
what
turned
out
to
be
a
first
degree
murder
charge.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
that's
the
way
the
complaint
read.
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
he
got
the
benefit
of
the
juvenile
court
procedure
as
transferred
to
the
adult
court,
released
on
bail
which
had
been
denied
to
him
as
--
when
he
was
getting
the
benefit
of
being
treated
as
a
juvenile
and
then
he
was
indicted
for
first
degree
murder.
justice
abe
fortas
was
the
petition
of
the
juvenile
court
to
transfer
buddy
lynn
whittington
to
the
adult
court?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
did
that
come
about?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
are
you
now
telling
us
that
nobody,
no
state
official
requested
the
judge
to
transfer
buddy
lynn
whittington
from
a
status
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
juvenile
court
to
the
adult
court?
justice
abe
fortas
why
didn't
the
judge
transfer
him
before?
justice
abe
fortas
during
that
entire
period?
justice
abe
fortas
was
the
juvenile
judge's
finding
of
delinquency
presented
to
the
grand
jury?
justice
abe
fortas
you
went
before
the
grand
jury
made
an
independent
case.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me.
i
beg
your
pardon.
your
ohio
supreme
court
entertained
an
appeal
i
suppose.
they
have
some
requirement
of
finality.
justice
abe
fortas
your
ohio
supreme
court
entertained
on
appeal
from
the
precise
judgment
or
order
or
whatever
it
is
that
we
have
for
us,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
but
your
intermediate
court
or
whatever
--
justice
abe
fortas
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
abe
fortas
and
they
have
decided
that
for
state
purposes
at
any
rate,
this
is
a
final
order.
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
you're
saying
thus
is
that,
they
were
wrong
and
we
ought
to
overrule
them
on
that
question
of
state
law
or
i
suppose
you'd
have
to
say
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
this
is
not
a
final
order.
justice
abe
fortas
even
though
the
transfer
order,
the
binding
over
order
was
self
--it
didn't
involve
any
additional
findings,
did
it?
justice
abe
fortas
what
if
the
juvenile
court
fined
that
it
hadn't
found
in
connection
with
the
delinquency.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
i'm
saying
what
makes
you
with
the
binding
over
order
where
any
findings
made
by
the
juvenile
court
in
addition
to
the
findings
that
are
before
us
right
now.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
don't
your
statute
to
provide
that
a
juvenile
has
a
right
to
proceedings
in
the
juvenile
court?
does
your
statute
say
that
or
doesn't?
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
ohio
statute
provide
that
a
juvenile
has
--
who
is
charged
with
an
offense
or
whatever
magic
language
you
use
that
he
has
a
right
to
be
proceeded
against
in
the
juvenile
court
in
the
first
instance?
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
that
here
what's
happened
is
a
necessary
and
an
adjudication
of
delinquency
that
according
to
your
adversary
anyway
was
necessary
before
the
child
could
be
deprived
of
his
right
to
be
preceded
against
in
the
juvenile
and
not
the
adult
court.
justice
abe
fortas
as
my
understanding,
what
we're
dealing
with
here
maybe
a
finding
and
an
order
by
the
juvenile
court
which
in
effect
deprives
the
child
of
a
right
given
to
him
under
ohio
law
namely,
the
right
to
be
tried
in
the
juvenile
and
not
in
the
adult
court.
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
i
understand
you
but
the
point
is,
there
has
to
be
a
juvenile
court
proceeding
first
before
the
child
can
be
tried
in
the
adult
court.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
morehart,
apart
from
the
question
of
ultimate
penalty,
what
are
the
benefits
apart
from
the
question
of
ultimate
penalty,
what
are
the
benefits
that
buddy
lynn
whittington
received
by
reason
of
being
tried
in
the
juvenile
court
as
against
what
would
have
happened
to
him
in
the
adult
court?
justice
abe
fortas
i
would
have
been
an
advantage
of
his
being
as
an
adult.
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
that's
one
thing
on
the
deficit
side
is
so
far
as
the
ohio
juvenile
court
system
is
concerned.
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
telling
us
and
we
can
pass
to
the
next
one
is
that
if
he
had
been
an
adult
and
he
had
been
charged
with
exactly
the
same
thing
under
ohio
and
had
been
charged
with
second
degree
murder.
under
ohio
law,
he
would
have
had
a
right
to
bail.
justice
abe
fortas
whereas
being
a
juvenile,
he
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
judge.
justice
abe
fortas
and
he
did
not
get
bailed.
what
submits
the
advantage
of
the
juvenile
court
procedure
for
this
boy?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
you
can
say
that
this
boy
got
--
any
benefit
he
got,
any
protection
he
got
as
a
result
of
being
processed
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
in
the
juvenile
court
as
against
being
given
the
rights
under
our
constitution
in
an
adult
court.
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
not
what
the
record
--
what
the
opinion
below
says.
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
contrary
to
what
i've
seen
somewhere
in
this
record.
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
say
that
that
isn't
true?
that
statement
is
made
here.
justice
abe
fortas
where
did
this
curious
misapprehension
that
i
can't
spot
it
at
the
moment.
what's
the
basis
of
these
curious
statements
in
the
papers
before
us?
number
one
that
the
boy
was
kept
along
with
adult
prisoners,
number
two,
that
for
a
prolonged
period
of
time,
he
was
kept
in
solitary
confinement.
justice
abe
fortas
you
know
that
does
appear.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
this
boy
was
not
put
in
a
special
juvenile
facility
was
he?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
the
eighth
floor
facility?
justice
abe
fortas
are
there
any
other
benefits
that
this
boy
received
by
reason
of
the
ohio
juvenile
court
procedures?
justice
abe
fortas
well
apart
from
words
what
actually
happened
to
the
boy
here,
was
he
given
any
procedural
rights
that
he
would
not
get
as
an
adult?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
was
the
basis
then
for
the
arrest
warrant?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
now
that
the
boy
had
been
an
adult
or
instead
of
being
permitted
to
the
discretion
of
the
juvenile
court
judge,
he
had
been
an
adult
charged
with
second
degree
murder.
he
would
then
have
had
a
right
to
bail
regardless
of
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
is
there
anything
else
that
--
this
boy.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
tell
me
what
could
have
accrued
to
his
benefit
once
we
pass
this
debate
about
what
the
judge
might
have
done
that
he
didn't
do
with
respect
to
the
release.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
nothing
in
this
record.
justice
abe
fortas
let's
don't
assume
that.
let's
talk
about
this
boy.
justice
abe
fortas
maybe
too
much
lowing
at
the
wrong
time
and
maybe
not
enough
lowing
in
terms
of
basic
structure.
what
would
you
say
to
that
mr.
green?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
disagree
with
the
constitutional
principle
that
provides
for
a
right
to
bail?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
like
that
happened
here
so
far
as
this
record
shows?
justice
abe
fortas
what
happened
here?
justice
abe
fortas
what
happened
here
in
effect
was
an
effort
by
the
juvenile
court
to
find
out
whether
this
boy
committed
the
offense.
this
terrible
crime
with
what
he
was
charged
in
substance
if
not
in
words.
and
when
it
had
for
that
purpose
and
without
any
of
these
attempts
that
we
all
talk
about
in
connection
with
the
juvenile
court,
to
find
out
what
kind
of
boy
he
is,
what
makes
him
take
and
what's
the
best
thing
to
do
with
him,
isn't
that
so?
justice
abe
fortas
where
do
you
find
that
in
--
where
do
you
find
anything
else
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
in
your
brief,
you
referred
to
that
as
shameful
incarceration
of
this
boy.
justice
abe
fortas
shameful
treatment.
justice
abe
fortas
on
the
presence
of
substantial
--
justice
abe
fortas
without
weighing
it.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
rezneck,
mr.
morehart
challenged
the
statement
that's
been
made
about
a
boy
being
confined
and
along
with
adult
and
being
in
solitary
confinement.
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
abe
fortas
that
was
after
a
personal
viewing
by
the
court.
justice
abe
fortas
well
mr.
rezneck,
it
has
been
urged
before
us
in
this
case
and
it's
been
otherwise
urged
that
the
state
has
a
burden
of
showing
that
the
classification
of
children
for
purposes
of
various
applications
of
its
laws
is
a
reasonable
one
and
in
terms
of
justification
of
denial
of
certain
rights,
certain
constitutional
rights.
and
it's
been
urged
that
for
the
state
to
bear
that
first,
it's
got
to
show
a
wide
range
of
factors
to
indicate
that
the
classification
is
reasonable.
and
among
those
factors
is
the
question
of
what
the
state
does
with
respect
to
the
child.
it
makes
it
reasonable
for
the
state
to
classify
the
child
separately
and
differently
with
respect
to
the
administration
of
its
law
of
offenses
including
their
things
of
which
juveniles
are
charged.
and
from
that
point
of
view,
it's
urged
that
the
question
of
facilities
or
no
facilities
available
for
special
treatment
of
juveniles
is
relevant
to
the
constitutional
question.
the
state
that
to
you
not
to
reflect
my
own
view
on
it
because
i
don't
at
the
moment
have
a
view
on
that
but
as
making
