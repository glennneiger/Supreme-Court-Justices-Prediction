what's
the
status
of
this?
has
he
been
in
jail?
justice

black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
some
certification
procedure
in
the
ohio
statutes
from
this
court
to
the
ohio
courts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
rezneck,
is
there
anything
that
this
boy
--
any
benefit
that
this
boy
got
as
a
result
of
his
classification
as
juvenile?
is
there
anything
that
you
can
think
of?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
he
was
sent
to
a
place
for
a
diagnosis,
mental
examination.
i
suppose
that
in
ohio,
an
adult
is
--
there's
that
sort
of
a
procedure
for
adults,
isn't
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
so
far
as
you
know,
this
boy
by
reason
of
being
a
juvenile,
14
years
old,
received
not
more
but
less
protection
and
less
consideration
in
the
state
of
ohio
than
it
would
have
if
he
were
an
adult,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
probate
judge
a
lawyer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
are
all
lawyers
in
ohio?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
he
had
no
discretion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
i
understand
you
to
say
a
while
ago
that
the
question
of
vagueness
is
upon
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
right
to
be.
