justice
byron
r.
white
has
the
grand
jury
taken
any
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
he
bound
over
as
an
adult?
is
he
imprisoned
as
an
adult?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
assessment
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
but
what
is
the
jail?
is
it
one
where
they
house
adult
prisoners
or
is
it
a
special
kind
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
state
takes
the
position
that
in
these
circumstances,
in
these
procedural
circumstances,
the
boy
was
not
entitled
to
bail,
am
i
correct
in
that
understanding?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
i
understand
it
though,
mr.
rezneck,
it's
not
that
clear
that
if
you
prevailed
here
and
this
juvenile
court
judgment
were
reversed
that
it
follows
that
the
indictment
would
be
dismissed
in
state
proceedings,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
still
remains
to
be
tested
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
this
came
about
and
you
could
not
get
it
dismissed,
would
you
have
any
basis
to
come
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
my
question
is,
if
you
try
to
get
the
indictment
dismissed
and
failed
in
the
state
proceeding,
can
you
conceive
of
any
basis
on
which
you
could
come
here
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
order
exactly
over
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
is
it
that
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
an
order
entered
by
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
was
involved
between
the
finding
of
delinquency
and
the
order
of
transfer,
about
15
months?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
just
approximately.
i
don't
want
to
take
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
sure
that
it
was
quite
that
long,
your
honor.
i
think
it
was
on
the
order
of
approximately
a
year
before
the
indictment
--
justice
byron
r.
white
about
a
year,
alright.
now,
was
the
juvenile
court
inhibited
by
a
stay
during
all
of
that
period
from
entering
the
order
of
transfer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
question
really
in
my
mind,
one
of
the
many
procedural
questions
here
to
my
mind
is
whether
the
juvenile
court
intended
initially
that
this
finding
of
delinquency
to
be
the
prelude
to
a
transfer
to
the
adult
court.
i
suppose
there's
nothing
from
which
we
can
get
any
light
on
that
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
rezneck,
why
is
it
the
final
order
--
why
do
you
say
their
final
order
is
the
delinquency
finding?
you
don't
need
to
rest
on
that.
why
is
the
final
order,
the
order
of
binding
him
over?
once
that's
done,
once
that
order
is
entered,
the
juvenile
court
loses
its
jurisdiction
--
that's
a
disposition.
that
is
one
of
the
dispositions
possible
in
the
juvenile
court.
are
you
suggesting
that
there's
any
problem
with
our
reviewing?
it
may
be
reviewing
an
order
of
a
juvenile
court
binding
over
to
the
adult
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
this
doesn't
have
to
be
on
the
record,
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
the
standard
in
ohio
for
binding
over
from
the
juvenile
court
to
the
adult
court
was
--
it's
certain
that
he's
alleged
to
have
committed
a
certain
kind
of
crime
and
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
committed
it.
and
orally
in
his
oral
announcement,
it
sounded
like
that's
the
way
the
judge
was
going
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
that
particular
moment
--
it
says
delinquent.
but
if
that
were
the
standard
and
the
juvenile
court
had
this
hearing,
which
might
be
called
a
preliminary
hearing
of
some
kind
â€“
then
bound
him
over,
do
you
think
you
would
have
the
same
constitutional
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
that
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
have
all
these
other
questions?
it
wouldn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
hardly
be
relevant
at
that
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
was
just
a
proceeding
to
determine
where
they
should
be
bound
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
state
law
does
provide
for
--
you
yourself
conceded
that
it
provides
for
some
preliminary
consideration
before
being
--
before
binding
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
goes
on
and
says
that
there
must
be
a
full
scale
delinquency
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
rezneck,
incidentally,
if
really
what's
before
us
is
this
turnover
of
judgment,
if
that's
really
the
--
and
we
would
agree
with
you
on
any
of
our
arguments.
that's
the
order
that
has
to
be
reversed.
what
then
would
be
the
impact
of
that
kind
of
reversal
upon
indictment?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
still
have
to
go
to
the
ohio
courts
then
to
have
the
indictment
dismissed?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
still
would
be
open
to
the
ohio
courts
to
say
notwithstanding
the
judgment
turning
him
over
to
the
adult
courts
has
been
reversed
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
the
indictment
is
nevertheless
a
good
indictment.
would
that
be
open
to
this
court
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
said
also
that
even
if
reversing
the
order
turning
over
necessarily
involves
our
crossing
the
bridge
of
deciding
what
the
ohio
statutes
really
mean
in
terms
of
what's
necessary
for
a
turnover.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
if
we
give
it
a
--
if
we
read
it
differently
than
the
way
you
read
it,
then
the
order
might
be
valid.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
i
know,
but
if
all
that
had
to
happen
--
if
the
order
in
the
review
is
the
turnover
order
and
if
all
that
had
to
happen
under
the
ohio
statutes
was
x
but
they
happen
to
do
x
plus
y,
and
did
x
plus
y
wrongly
but
did
x
correctly,
i'm
not
so
sure
we
should
reverse
the
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
actually,
that's
kind
of
a
modest
statement,
isn't
it?
if
i
correctly
understand
your
argument,
that
is
to
say
that
an
adult
--
it
is
argued
and
it's
submitted
here
that
an
adult
would
have
been
entitled
to
bail
and
that
was
denied
to
this
boy,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
regard
this
as
a
preliminary
hearing
prior
to
grand
jury
proceedings,
for
some
reason
there
may
have
been
the
fault
of
the
various
stays
that
were
obtained
that
this
boy
was
incarcerated
for
15
months
before
the
matter
was
in
and
submitted
on
the
grand
jury,
maybe
12
months,
whatever
it
was,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
finding
here
was
the
finding
of
probable
cause,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
judging
of
delinquency
based
upon
a
recital
that
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
boy
was
delinquent,
is
that
correctly
recalled?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
wouldn't
you
extend
it
certainly
to
any
charge
of
committing
conduct
which
would
expose
him
to
loss
of
liberty.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
won't
argue
that,
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
juvenile
court
has
a
separate
court
with
a
separate
judge
in
fairfield
county.
justice
byron
r.
white
separate
court
room.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
is
the
same
judge
as
the
probate
judge.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
there's
a
different
judge
as
common
pleas
judge,
there
are
two
judges.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
was
out
less
than
a
month
after
the
proceedings
had
been
transferred
to
the
adult
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
when
he
was
an
adult,
he
could
get
out.
but
when
he
was
treated
as
a
juvenile,
he
couldn't
get
out,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
your
law
provides?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
explain
that
seeming
anomaly?
it's
the
same
boy
isn't
it,
14-year-old
boy.
the
offense
is
the
same
regardless
of
its
technical
designation
under
the
--
as
a
juvenile
offense
or
an
adult
offense,
the
act
he
is
charged
with
is
the
same
act
namely
the
murder
of
mrs.
willard.
now,
how
do
you
count
for
the
fact
that
as
a
juvenile,
he
was
kept
in
children's
file
and
immediately,
he
is
given
the
status
of
an
adult
and
he
is
out
on
bail?
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me
mr.
morehart
but
may
i
ask,
we
don't
understand
that
you're
able
to
present
more
evidence
to
the
grand
jury
than
you're
able
to
produce
before
the
juvenile
judge.
is
this
what
explains
the
indictment
for
first
degree?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
he
found
the
buddy
lynn
whittington
committed
this
act
and
then
he
ordered
it
instead
of
--
he
ordered
him
to
go
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
which
is
an
additional
proceeding
to
finding
him
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
while
he
was
there,
the
appeal
was
taken.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
suggesting
that
if
there
hadn't
been
an
appeal
at
that
moment
and
then
he
had
come
back
to
--
he
had
come
back
to
diagnostic
center,
the
judge
would
have
found
him
over
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
is
your
order
to
bind
over
appealable
in
your
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
a
final
order
in
your
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
an
appeal
had
not
been
taken
until
buddy
can
get
back
to
the
diagnostic
center
and
he
had
been
bound
over.
and
then
there
was
an
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
appeal
was
to
challenge
the
order
to
bind
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
would
you
suggest
that
what
questions
then
would
have
been
relevant
or
what
questions
could
have
been
opened?
wouldn't
the
same
questions
that
had
been
opened
that
are
now
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
even
though
the
finding
that
he
committed
this
act
and
the
finding
that
he
is
delinquent
are
made
only
as
a
preliminary
to
binding
over?
could
it
be
that
--
let's
assume
that
some
--
let's
assume
that
he
was
not
permitted
cross-examination
for
example
at
that
theory.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
there
was
an
appeal
of
the
order
to
bind
over
after
it
was
entered
and
it
was
challenged
in
the
ohio
of
course
on
the
basis
that
they
then
proceed
--
that
the
denial
of
procedure
of
due
process
in
those
proceedings.
would
that
kind
of
a
point
be
open
in
your
ohio
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
open
here
if
they
brought
it
up
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
--
is
that
really
quite
--
the
order
now
has
been
entered,
has
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
taken
before
the
entry
of
that
binding?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
long
after
the
review
was
sought
here
was
a
bind
of
order
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
before
we
agreed
to
review
this
case,
i
forgot
what
date
that
was.
could
anyone
tell
us
about
this
bind
over
order?
could
you
tell
us
the
opposition
for
the
petition
for
review?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
event,
no
one
sought
to
appeal
the
binding
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
order
has
been
appealed.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
the
one
you
say
that
if
it
were
brought
on
that,
we
can
review
and
get
to
the
same
questions
that
the
petitioner
now
reads.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
--
perhaps
--
maybe
some
of
those
questions
might
come
up
but
at
least
we
would
have
jurisdiction
to
review
that
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
is
presently
incarcerated?
justice
byron
r.
white
after
indictment
he
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
his
bail
was
cancelled.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
used
the
bind
over
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mthat
isn't
here.
it's
still
in
the
ohio
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
could
have
been
released
in
the
juvenile
court
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
the
discretion
have
been
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
what?
i
didn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
another
question
that
i
will
--
thank
you
for
your
attention.
thank
you
very
much.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
before
we
acted
on
the
petition,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
any
reason
why
we
weren't
asked
to
act
down
the
petition
in
respect
to
the
turnover.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
after
it
was
and
before
we
acted
on
the
petition,
it
was
a
long
interval
before
we
acted
on
the
petition.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
said
that
and
i've
looked
for
it
with
no
success.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
denied
a
stay?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
a
separate
question
for
finality
with
its
final
progress.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
have
happened
in
the
juvenile
court
if
the
court
had
decided
when
the
--
when
it
was
permitted
to
go
forward
that
it
wouldn't
--
that
the
court
would
not
turnover.
what
order
would
have
been
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
still
a
disposition
order
to
be
entered.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
are
still
in
this
case
necessarily
--
at
least
another
order
had
to
be
entered
one
way
or
another.
justice
byron
r.
white
once
the
diagnostic
center
send
it
back
-â€“
is
that
the
statute
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
common
sense
would
indicate
that
perhaps
there
was
another
order
coming.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it's
relevant
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
this
delinquency
judgment
--
to
base
it
in
that
finding
in
anyway
on
whether
this
fellow
was
brought
and
was
kept
in
jail.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
the
grand
jury
taken
any
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
he
bound
over
as
an
adult?
is
he
imprisoned
as
an
adult?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
assessment
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
but
what
is
the
jail?
is
it
one
where
they
house
adult
prisoners
or
is
it
a
special
kind
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
state
takes
the
position
that
in
these
circumstances,
in
these
procedural
circumstances,
the
boy
was
not
entitled
to
bail,
am
i
correct
in
that
understanding?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
i
understand
it
though,
mr.
rezneck,
it's
not
that
clear
that
if
you
prevailed
here
and
this
juvenile
court
judgment
were
reversed
that
it
follows
that
the
indictment
would
be
dismissed
in
state
proceedings,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
still
remains
to
be
tested
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
this
came
about
and
you
could
not
get
it
dismissed,
would
you
have
any
basis
to
come
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
my
question
is,
if
you
try
to
get
the
indictment
dismissed
and
failed
in
the
state
proceeding,
can
you
conceive
of
any
basis
on
which
you
could
come
here
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
order
exactly
over
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
is
it
that
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
an
order
entered
by
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
was
involved
between
the
finding
of
delinquency
and
the
order
of
transfer,
about
15
months?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
just
approximately.
i
don't
want
to
take
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
sure
that
it
was
quite
that
long,
your
honor.
i
think
it
was
on
the
order
of
approximately
a
year
before
the
indictment
--
justice
byron
r.
white
about
a
year,
alright.
now,
was
the
juvenile
court
inhibited
by
a
stay
during
all
of
that
period
from
entering
the
order
of
transfer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
question
really
in
my
mind,
one
of
the
many
procedural
questions
here
to
my
mind
is
whether
the
juvenile
court
intended
initially
that
this
finding
of
delinquency
to
be
the
prelude
to
a
transfer
to
the
adult
court.
i
suppose
there's
nothing
from
which
we
can
get
any
light
on
that
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
rezneck,
why
is
it
the
final
order
--
why
do
you
say
their
final
order
is
the
delinquency
finding?
you
don't
need
to
rest
on
that.
why
is
the
final
order,
the
order
of
binding
him
over?
once
that's
done,
once
that
order
is
entered,
the
juvenile
court
loses
its
jurisdiction
--
that's
a
disposition.
that
is
one
of
the
dispositions
possible
in
the
juvenile
court.
are
you
suggesting
that
there's
any
problem
with
our
reviewing?
it
may
be
reviewing
an
order
of
a
juvenile
court
binding
over
to
the
adult
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
this
doesn't
have
to
be
on
the
record,
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
the
standard
in
ohio
for
binding
over
from
the
juvenile
court
to
the
adult
court
was
--
it's
certain
that
he's
alleged
to
have
committed
a
certain
kind
of
crime
and
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
committed
it.
and
orally
in
his
oral
announcement,
it
sounded
like
that's
the
way
the
judge
was
going
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
that
particular
moment
--
it
says
delinquent.
but
if
that
were
the
standard
and
the
juvenile
court
had
this
hearing,
which
might
be
called
a
preliminary
hearing
of
some
kind
â€“
then
bound
him
over,
do
you
think
you
would
have
the
same
constitutional
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
that
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
have
all
these
other
questions?
it
wouldn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
hardly
be
relevant
at
that
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
was
just
a
proceeding
to
determine
where
they
should
be
bound
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
state
law
does
provide
for
--
you
yourself
conceded
that
it
provides
for
some
preliminary
consideration
before
being
--
before
binding
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
goes
on
and
says
that
there
must
be
a
full
scale
delinquency
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
rezneck,
incidentally,
if
really
what's
before
us
is
this
turnover
of
judgment,
if
that's
really
the
--
and
we
would
agree
with
you
on
any
of
our
arguments.
that's
the
order
that
has
to
be
reversed.
what
then
would
be
the
impact
of
that
kind
of
reversal
upon
indictment?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
still
have
to
go
to
the
ohio
courts
then
to
have
the
indictment
dismissed?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
still
would
be
open
to
the
ohio
courts
to
say
notwithstanding
the
judgment
turning
him
over
to
the
adult
courts
has
been
reversed
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
the
indictment
is
nevertheless
a
good
indictment.
would
that
be
open
to
this
court
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
said
also
that
even
if
reversing
the
order
turning
over
necessarily
involves
our
crossing
the
bridge
of
deciding
what
the
ohio
statutes
really
mean
in
terms
of
what's
necessary
for
a
turnover.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
if
we
give
it
a
--
if
we
read
it
differently
than
the
way
you
read
it,
then
the
order
might
be
valid.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
i
know,
but
if
all
that
had
to
happen
--
if
the
order
in
the
review
is
the
turnover
order
and
if
all
that
had
to
happen
under
the
ohio
statutes
was
x
but
they
happen
to
do
x
plus
y,
and
did
x
plus
y
wrongly
but
did
x
correctly,
i'm
not
so
sure
we
should
reverse
the
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
actually,
that's
kind
of
a
modest
statement,
isn't
it?
if
i
correctly
understand
your
argument,
that
is
to
say
that
an
adult
--
it
is
argued
and
it's
submitted
here
that
an
adult
would
have
been
entitled
to
bail
and
that
was
denied
to
this
boy,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
regard
this
as
a
preliminary
hearing
prior
to
grand
jury
proceedings,
for
some
reason
there
may
have
been
the
fault
of
the
various
stays
that
were
obtained
that
this
boy
was
incarcerated
for
15
months
before
the
matter
was
in
and
submitted
on
the
grand
jury,
maybe
12
months,
whatever
it
was,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
finding
here
was
the
finding
of
probable
cause,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
judging
of
delinquency
based
upon
a
recital
that
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
boy
was
delinquent,
is
that
correctly
recalled?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
wouldn't
you
extend
it
certainly
to
any
charge
of
committing
conduct
which
would
expose
him
to
loss
of
liberty.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
won't
argue
that,
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
juvenile
court
has
a
separate
court
with
a
separate
judge
in
fairfield
county.
justice
byron
r.
white
separate
court
room.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
is
the
same
judge
as
the
probate
judge.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
there's
a
different
judge
as
common
pleas
judge,
there
are
two
judges.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
was
out
less
than
a
month
after
the
proceedings
had
been
transferred
to
the
adult
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
when
he
was
an
adult,
he
could
get
out.
but
when
he
was
treated
as
a
juvenile,
he
couldn't
get
out,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
your
law
provides?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
explain
that
seeming
anomaly?
it's
the
same
boy
isn't
it,
14-year-old
boy.
the
offense
is
the
same
regardless
of
its
technical
designation
under
the
--
as
a
juvenile
offense
or
an
adult
offense,
the
act
he
is
charged
with
is
the
same
act
namely
the
murder
of
mrs.
willard.
now,
how
do
you
count
for
the
fact
that
as
a
juvenile,
he
was
kept
in
children's
file
and
immediately,
he
is
given
the
status
of
an
adult
and
he
is
out
on
bail?
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me
mr.
morehart
but
may
i
ask,
we
don't
understand
that
you're
able
to
present
more
evidence
to
the
grand
jury
than
you're
able
to
produce
before
the
juvenile
judge.
is
this
what
explains
the
indictment
for
first
degree?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
he
found
the
buddy
lynn
whittington
committed
this
act
and
then
he
ordered
it
instead
of
--
he
ordered
him
to
go
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
which
is
an
additional
proceeding
to
finding
him
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
while
he
was
there,
the
appeal
was
taken.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
suggesting
that
if
there
hadn't
been
an
appeal
at
that
moment
and
then
he
had
come
back
to
--
he
had
come
back
to
diagnostic
center,
the
judge
would
have
found
him
over
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
is
your
order
to
bind
over
appealable
in
your
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
a
final
order
in
your
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
an
appeal
had
not
been
taken
until
buddy
can
get
back
to
the
diagnostic
center
and
he
had
been
bound
over.
and
then
there
was
an
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
appeal
was
to
challenge
the
order
to
bind
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
would
you
suggest
that
what
questions
then
would
have
been
relevant
or
what
questions
could
have
been
opened?
wouldn't
the
same
questions
that
had
been
opened
that
are
now
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
even
though
the
finding
that
he
committed
this
act
and
the
finding
that
he
is
delinquent
are
made
only
as
a
preliminary
to
binding
over?
could
it
be
that
--
let's
assume
that
some
--
let's
assume
that
he
was
not
permitted
cross-examination
for
example
at
that
theory.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
there
was
an
appeal
of
the
order
to
bind
over
after
it
was
entered
and
it
was
challenged
in
the
ohio
of
course
on
the
basis
that
they
then
proceed
--
that
the
denial
of
procedure
of
due
process
in
those
proceedings.
would
that
kind
of
a
point
be
open
in
your
ohio
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
open
here
if
they
brought
it
up
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
--
is
that
really
quite
--
the
order
now
has
been
entered,
has
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
taken
before
the
entry
of
that
binding?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
long
after
the
review
was
sought
here
was
a
bind
of
order
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
before
we
agreed
to
review
this
case,
i
forgot
what
date
that
was.
could
anyone
tell
us
about
this
bind
over
order?
could
you
tell
us
the
opposition
for
the
petition
for
review?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
event,
no
one
sought
to
appeal
the
binding
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
order
has
been
appealed.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
the
one
you
say
that
if
it
were
brought
on
that,
we
can
review
and
get
to
the
same
questions
that
the
petitioner
now
reads.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
--
perhaps
--
maybe
some
of
those
questions
might
come
up
but
at
least
we
would
have
jurisdiction
to
review
that
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
is
presently
incarcerated?
justice
byron
r.
white
after
indictment
he
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
his
bail
was
cancelled.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
used
the
bind
over
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mthat
isn't
here.
it's
still
in
the
ohio
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
could
have
been
released
in
the
juvenile
court
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
the
discretion
have
been
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
what?
i
didn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
another
question
that
i
will
--
thank
you
for
your
attention.
thank
you
very
much.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
before
we
acted
on
the
petition,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
any
reason
why
we
weren't
asked
to
act
down
the
petition
in
respect
to
the
turnover.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
after
it
was
and
before
we
acted
on
the
petition,
it
was
a
long
interval
before
we
acted
on
the
petition.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
said
that
and
i've
looked
for
it
with
no
success.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
denied
a
stay?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
a
separate
question
for
finality
with
its
final
progress.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
have
happened
in
the
juvenile
court
if
the
court
had
decided
when
the
--
when
it
was
permitted
to
go
forward
that
it
wouldn't
--
that
the
court
would
not
turnover.
what
order
would
have
been
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
still
a
disposition
order
to
be
entered.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
are
still
in
this
case
necessarily
--
at
least
another
order
had
to
be
entered
one
way
or
another.
justice
byron
r.
white
once
the
diagnostic
center
send
it
back
-â€“
is
that
the
statute
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
common
sense
would
indicate
that
perhaps
there
was
another
order
coming.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it's
relevant
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
this
delinquency
judgment
--
to
base
it
in
that
finding
in
anyway
on
whether
this
fellow
was
brought
and
was
kept
in
jail.
