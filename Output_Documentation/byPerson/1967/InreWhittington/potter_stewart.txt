justice
potter
stewart
i
misunderstood
you
there.
i
thought
it
never
dawned
over
to
the
grand
jury
on
the
charge
of
first
degree
murder.
justice
potter
stewart
first
degree
murder
is
not
bailable,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
problem
is
the
worrying
i
think
of
the
ohio
statute,
isn't
it?
the
2151.26
of
the
ohio
revised
code.
i'll
read
it
all,
that
any
case
involving
a
delinquent
child
in
the
--
and
in
certain
circumstances
that
gives
the
juvenile
court
the
power
to
bind
them
over
for
trial
on
adult
court
or
to
treat
him
as
a
juvenile.
but
some
of
the
juvenile
judges
in
ohio
think
that
they
are
required
to
make
a
finding
of
delinquency
before
they
can
bind
them
over
to
the
grand
jury.
and
in
other
counties,
they
don't
feel
obliged
to
make
a
finding
of
delinquency
before
they
can
bind
them
over
to
grand
jury
that
juvenile
court
did.
and
he
made
a
finding
of
delinquency,
and
then
he
bound
him
over
to
the
grand
jury
on
the
charge
of
first
degree
murder,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
ambiguous
and
there's
a
bill
now,
i
think
as
i
understand
it
in
the
ohio
legislature
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
some
of
the
juvenile
courts
in
ohio,
i
must
say
changed
their
practice,
to
not
feel
obligated
to
make
a
formal
finding
of
delinquency
before
they
bind
them
over
for
adult.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
he
hasn't
been
tried
on
the
crime
of
murder
yet.
i
think
he's
under
indictment
awaiting
trial
on
the
charge
of
murder
in
an
adult
court.
justice
potter
stewart
and
has
been
bound
over
to
grand
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case,
as
you
tell
us,
as
you
read
the
ohio
statute
in
this
case,
the
finding
of
delinquency
was
a
necessary
condition
precedent
to
binding
them
over
to
the
grand
jury
for
trial
on
a
charge
of
first
degree
murder.
and
that's
what
the
result
of
the
delinquency
finding
was
in
this
case,
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know
you
think
it
is,
but
what
if
you're
wrong?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
you're
wrong?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
they
told
you
that
you
were
wrong?
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
well
the
limit
is,
mr.
rezneck
of
the
situation
where
the
charge
of
delinquency
depended
upon
evidence
of
conduct
which
committed
by
an
adult
would
be
a
felony?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you
said
there's
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
but
it
was
denied.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there's
an
appeal
from
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
dismiss.
justice
potter
stewart
why
is
there
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
denial
of
that
motion?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
morehart
may
i
ask,
if
the
turnover
order
were
before
us
and
if
we
were
to
set
it
aside,
what
would
be
the
effect
upon
the
indictment?
justice
potter
stewart
subject
to
indictment.
justice
potter
stewart
but
apart
from
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
hypothesis
i
gave
you,
the
indictment
would
be
invalidated
and
i
gather
this
time
would
require
a
brand
new
juvenile
court
proceeding
under
whatever
standard
we
set
or
to
govern
such
procedures
which
might
stand
in
up
again
i
take
it
in
a
disposition
which
was
a
turnover
order.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
pretty
well
settled
in
ohio?
it
used
to
be
at
my
understanding
was
at
least
there
used
to
be
that
the
area
of
the
first
degree
murder
actually
indicted
the
first
degree
murder
that
don't
have
any
right
to
bail.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
wasn't
arrested
for
a
crime
in
the
first
place,
was
he?
justice
potter
stewart
he
wasn't
charged
for
the
crime.
justice
potter
stewart
he
got
no
criminal
record
