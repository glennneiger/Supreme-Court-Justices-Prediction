mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
answer
to
the
question
that's
been
raised
here
with
respect
to
the
specific
charge
against
this
boy,
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
page
12
of
the
record
which
contains
the
complaint
that
was
filed
in
the
juvenile
court
and
it
alleges
that
he
is
a
delinquent
child
and
that
he
unlawfully
killed
mrs.
willard
in
violation
of
section
2901.05
of
the
code
of
ohio,
which
is
the
ohio
second
degree
murder
statute.
so
that
was
the
allegation
upon
which
this
case
was
tried
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
understand
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
we
think
that
you
do
have
a
final
judgment
here
under
the
test
that
this
court
has
laid
down
for
finality
that
the
juvenile
proceeding
and
the
adult
criminal
preceding
are
separate
proceedings
under
the
law
of
ohio.
that
you
had
a
juvenile
delinquency
proceeding
which
was
a
trial
on
the
merits
of
the
delinquency
charge
and
it
has
resulted
in
a
final
judgment
adjudicating
the
boy
to
be
a
delinquent.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
there
was
not
a
final
order
of
disposition,
your
honor.
there
was
what
is
called
--
and
the
order
recites
a
temporary
commitment
to
the
ohio
youth
commission
so
that
there
was
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
for
examination.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
he
was
returned
following
that.
but
the
adjudication
of
delinquency
gave
the
juvenile
court
power
to
act
coarsely
on
his
person,
power
to
commit
him,
legal
custody,
physical
custody
of
the
boy
under
ohio
law
passed
thereby
from
his
parents
to
the
state.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
the
judgment
of
the
juvenile
court
is
reversed
here,
your
honor
we
believe
that
the
indictment
falls
with
it
and
that
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
under
the
ohio
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
under
the
ohio
statute,
there
is
no
criminal
jurisdiction
until
there
has
been
a
valid
certification
of
the
boy
by
the
juvenile
court.
in
other
words,
the
juvenile
court
has
exclusive
criminal
jurisdiction
until
it
makes
a
transfer
to
the
adult
court.
and
we
believe
that
if
the
judgment
of
delinquency,
which
is
a
prerequisite
under
ohio
law
to
a
valid
transfer
falls
that
the
indictment
falls
with
it
and
it
will
be
subject
to
a
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
court
of
common
pleas.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
we
have
directed
ourselves
in
the
reply
brief
to
the
issue
both
of
finality
and
to
whether
the
possibility
of
certification
should
have
any
effect
on
the
finality
of
the
judgment.
and
that
we
think
we've
demonstrated
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
consequences
which
state
law
attaches
to
this
judgment
of
delinquency
--
that
you
do
have
a
final
judgment
and
that
the
court
is
not
being
asked
to
do
a
useless
thing
here.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
don't
know
what
the
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
we
don't
admit
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
your
honor
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
the
national
council
so
states,
your
honor.
but
we
think
that
statute
is
clear
that
he
must
be
adjudicated
a
delinquent
and
that
certification
or
binding
over
is
simply
another
form
of
disposition,
which
is
available
to
the
juvenile
court
judge.
once
he's
made
a
finding
of
delinquency
so
that
this
was
in
substance
and
to
all
intents
and
purposes
a
delinquency
proceeding,
which
could
have
resulted
in
a
variety
of
possible
orders,
among
them
certification,
but
there
can
be
no
question
as
to
the
finality
of
the
judgment
which
was
entered.
it
had
the
immediate
effect
of
adjudicating
this
boy
a
juvenile
delinquent
with
all
the
attendant's
stigma
and
it
labeled
him
a
murderer,
had
found
that
he
had
committed
the
crime
of
murder.
will
you
call
it
delinquency
or
anything
else?
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
as
an
adult,
he
has
not
been
found
to
be
guilty
of
the
crime
of
murder.
he
has
been
found
by
the
juvenile
court
and
the
decision
is
to
be
confirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--
to
be
a
delinquent
by
reason
of
having
committed
the
act
of
murder.
so
to
all
intents
and
purposes,
he
has
been
labeled
with
the
stigma
of
a
murderer.
we
would
point
out
that
the
certification
of
whatever
happens
to
him
now
isn't
going
to
undo
that.
you
have
a
separate
proceeding
here;
a
juvenile
proceeding
which
has
resulted
in
a
final
judgment
of
delinquency.
and
whatever
happens
to
him
in
the
subsequent
adult
proceeding,
you
were
still
going
to
have
this
judgment
of
delinquency.
you
had
incarceration
pursuant
to
the
judgment
which
lasted
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
before
the
binding
over
took
place.
so
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
judgment
acted
coercively
on
this
boy,
not
the
parents.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
they've
lost
jurisdiction
by
transferring
the
case
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
whether
they
would
be
able
to
reassert
jurisdiction
by
a
new
proceeding
is
another
matter,
but
we
do
assert
that
we
can
get
the
indictment
and
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
would
say
you
have
two
things;
you
have
a
judgment
of
delinquency,
and
you
have
what
is
called
a
temporary
order
of
commitment.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
those
are
the
results
of
the
juvenile
court
judgment.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
in
this
particular
case,
that
is
right.
we
are
not
raising
questions
as
to
the
validity
of
the
adult
proceeding
at
this
time.
that
proceeding
and
any
issues
that
may
be
raised
therein
are
not
now
before
this
court.
we're
asking
you
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
delinquency
which
was
entered
in
the
firm
below.
and
we
believe
that
we
are
then
entitled
to
take
the
appropriate
procedural
steps
in
the
state
courts
to
have
the
adult
proceeding
dismissed.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
we
believe
that
under
a
fair
reading
of
the
state
statute
since
a
valid
finding
of
delinquency
is
a
prerequisite
to
transfer
that
the
adult
courts
would
not
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes
it
does,
your
honor.
i
cannot
say
any
authority
to
you
one
way
or
another
on
that
proposition,
but
i
think
that
the
statute
is
clear
here.
that
the
whole
framework
requires
that
the
adult
court
receives
jurisdiction
only
when
the
juvenile
court
has
validly
adjudicated
someone
as
delinquent,
and
has
validly
transferred
the
case
so
as
to
enable
the
adult
court
to
act.
and
we
do
submit
that
we
can
take
a
judgment
of
reversal
on
this
court
and
can
get
the
adult
proceeding
dismissed.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
since
these
questions
have
been
raised
and
decided
by
the
state
courts,
we
submit
that
they
are
properly
here
now
and
of
course
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
on
a
double
jeopardy
basis
perhaps,
your
honor.
this
is
an
argument
that
we
have
raised
in
the
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
because
you
have
a
state
system
here
that
seems
to
operate
by
adjudicating
someone
a
delinquent
after
a
trial,
that
provides
for
subsequent
trial
as
an
adult.
and
we
would
think
that
this
raises
substantial
double
jeopardy
problems,
although
they're
not
before
the
court
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
and
the
procedures
by
which
that
finding
was
arrived
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
believe
that
it
was,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
after
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
dismissed
the
appeal
for
one
of
a
substantial
question,
substantial
constitutional
question
that
during
that
interim
period
before
relief
was
sought
in
this
court
that
the
juvenile
court
exercised
authority
to
bind
this
boy
over.
there
was
no
stay
at
that
point.
there
had
been
a
stay
at
juvenile
court
proceedings
up
until
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
acted
in
it.
it
was
during
that
interim
period
that
these
further
proceedings
were
able
to
take
place.
we
of
course
do
take
the
position
and
we
think
it's
clear
on
the
record
below
that
what
you
had
here
was
a
delinquency
trial
on
the
merits.
what
took
place
here
was
agreed
by
everyone
--
the
lawyers,
the
judges,
the
reviewing
courts,
everyone
up
to
this
point
via
delinquency
trial
on
the
merits.
it
was
not
in
the
nature
of
a
binding
over
proceeding
or
a
preliminary
hearing
and
this
again
was
in
accord
with
our
view
of
the
clear
and
unambiguous
language
of
the
ohio
statute
as
requiring
an
adjudication
of
delinquency
after
a
trial
on
the
merits
before
any
further
dispositional
order
can
be
entered.
and
i
would
therefore
like
to
address
myself
to
the
procedural
issues
than
which
we
contend
to
arise
with
respect
to
a
court's
power
to
adjudicate
someone,
a
delinquent
face
on
a
charge
of
a
law
violation.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
yes
we
do,
your
honor.
this
has
been
held
to
be
a
final
unappealable
judgment
by
the
state
courts
of
ohio.
and
furthermore,
the
consequences
that
attach
to
the
judgment
of
delinquency
under
the
law
of
the
state
meet
to
test
for
finality
which
this
court
has
laid
down
in
determining
its
own
jurisdiction
under
the
jurisdictional
statute.
in
other
words,
you
had
immediate
and
enormous
consequences
on
this
boy
from
the
delinquency
adjudication
itself,
namely
an
order
of
commitment
and
the
delinquency
adjudication,
which
banned
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
believe
it's
contained
in
the
state's
opposition
to
certiorari.
i
believe
that
they
bring
it
to
the
court's
attention,
so
that
it
was
before
this
court
at
the
time
that
the
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
assume
that
there
was
but
it's
not
part
of
the
record
and
it
is
not
in
the
record
before
this
court.
in
other
words,
it
was
not
brought
up
in
the
record,
which
we
have
here
from
the
juvenile
court.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
believe
that
the
--
would
you
indulge
me
for
just
--
just
one
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
only
until
the
ohio
supreme
court
acted.
the
juvenile
court
proceedings
were
stayed
but
after
the
ohio
supreme
court
dismissed
the
appeal,
at
that
point,
there
was
no
further
stay
against
juvenile
court
proceedings.
and
it
was
thereafter
that
the
transfer
and
the
binding
over
ensued.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
the
record
is
certainly
ambiguous
about
that
and
due
to
the
fact
that
the
juvenile
court
in
effect
made
conflicting
statements
on
the
point.
but
we
don't
think
that
the
subjective
intent
of
the
juvenile
court,
whatever
that
may
have
been,
would
be
relevant
because
the
point
is,
that
this
was
a
delinquency
trial.
it
was
treated
as
a
delinquency
trial
by
everyone
involved.
it
resulted
as
it
must
in
the
ohio
law
in
our
view
in
a
judgment
of
delinquency.
and
therefore,
for
review
purposes,
it
should
be
treated
just
as
if
he
had
made
some
other
order
of
disposition
such
as
sending
the
boy
to
the
industrial
school
until
he
was
21,
or
entering
a
temporary
order
of
commitment,
which
can
be
indefinitely
renewed
until
21,
which
is
another
power
of
the
court.
in
other
words,
the
juvenile
court
has
a
whole
panoply
of
disposition
orders.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
we
think
that
the
adult
criminal
cases
that
are
dealt
with
sentencing
are
distinguishable
for
several
reasons.
one
being
that,
it's
simply
as
a
matter
of
form,
you
don't
have
a
judgment
in
a
criminal
case
until
you
have
the
sentence
entered
and
here
we
do
have
what
is
called
the
judgment
which
was
reviewed
as
a
judgment
and
healthier
judgment
by
the
ohio
court
of
appeals.
furthermore,
you
have
a
difference
in
the
way
juvenile
and
adult
courts
operate
in
the
sense
that
a
juvenile
court,
once
it
adjudicates
someone
a
delinquent,
it
has
a
continuing
supervisory
jurisdiction
over
a
juvenile
and
can
make
dispositional
orders
of
a
temporary
nature
and
it
may
modify
them
from
time
to
time.
in
other
words,
it
has
a
kind
of
continuing
authority
that
an
adult
criminal
court
does
not
have.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no,
i
think
certainly
not
and
i
think
the
question
is
precisely
the
same.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
that
is
true.
the
questions,
the
constitutional
issues
raised
would
be
precisely
the
same
in
our
view.
and
we
think
furthermore
that
there
is
an
advantage,
a
distinct
advantage
from
the
standpoint
of
judicial
administration.
in
reviewing
the
case
at
this
point
because
as
this
court
will
recall
in
kent
versus
united
states,
where
you
did
not
have
a
review
of
the
transfer
letter
until
after
the
adult
criminal
trial
had
taken
place.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
at
that
particular
moment
in
time
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
if
this
were
in
fact
a
preliminary
hearing
and
if
the
ohio
statutes
provided
for
a
proceeding
in
the
nature
of
a
preliminary
hearing,
which
they
do
not,
then
i
think
we
would
have
a
different
constitutional
question.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
that
would
be
whether
there
was
fair
notice
of
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
if
it
were
not
in
delinquency
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
that
is,
if
it
were
a
delinquency
trial,
if
it
were
not
a
delinquency
trial
on
the
merits
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
if
the
state
law
provided
for
such
a
proceeding,
yes,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
we
think
it
provides
to
a
more
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
we
think
that
that's
a
necessary
reading
of
the
statute.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
if
we're
wrong
on
that,
we
haven't
been
told
so
by
the
state
courts
because
we
think
that
the
state
court
in
this
case
reviewed
this
as
a
delinquency
judgment
and
i've
held
up
that
he
was
charged
with
delinquency
and
he
was
adjudicated
to
be
a
delinquent,
and
we
would
take
that
to
be
conclusive
of
what
the
nature
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
think
that
the
only
persons
who
could
tell
us
that
would
be
the
state
courts
and
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
then
we
would
have
a
different
constitutional
issue
raised
than
the
ones
that
we
are
raising
here.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
if
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
think
as
a
matter
of
form,
we
would
have
to
make
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
and
profit
the
judgment
of
this
court,
to
give
the
courts
below
a
basis
for
doing
that.
but
we
think
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
getting
that
done.
once
you
notice
--
once
you
knock
out
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
still
open
to
the
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
we
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
want
to
say
your
honor
it
isn't
just
my
reading
of
it.
it's
the
reading
of
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
in
this
very
case,
which
said
this
boy
is
alleged
to
be
a
juvenile
delinquent.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
juvenile
delinquency.
we
uphold
it
under
preponderance
of
the
evidence
test.
we
reject
other
constitutional
claims
because
this
is
in
the
nature
of
a
juvenile
delinquency
proceeding
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
think
we
should
still
have
notice
that
they
were
proposing
to
do
x.
and
what
we
had
noticed
was
--
what
we
had
notice
of
it
was
this
was
a
delinquency
trial
on
the
merits.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
to
get
a
ruling
on
--
from
the
state
court
on
the
matter
of
state
law,
i'm
not
aware
that
there
is
a
statute
of
ohio
that
enables
you
to
do
that.
but
again,
we
do
submit
that
this
particular
question
is
really
foreclosed
by
the
decision
of
the
ohio
court
in
this
very
case,
holding
that
this
is
a
final
judgment
of
delinquency.
i
don't
have
very
much
time
left
to
argue
the
merits
here,
but
i
would
like
to
indicate
what
our
views
are
on
the
assumption
which
we
think
is
undeniable
on
the
record
and
under
the
statutory
framework
here,
that
this
was
a
trial
of
delinquency,
no
different
from
any
other
trial
on
the
merits
of
a
charge
of
delinquency.
and
here,
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
first,
this
was
a
proceeding
in
which
the
charge
of
delinquency
was
based
solely
upon
the
violation
of
a
state
criminal
statute
and
a
serious
state
criminal
statute
at
that
of
murder.
this
was
not
a
case
in
the
court
below
so
held
in
which
an
adjudication
of
delinquency
could
have
been
upheld
on
any
other
ground.
and
this
was
a
proceeding
which
as
i've
already
outlined
carried
various
serious
consequences
for
the
juvenile,
a
possibility
of
seven
years
incarceration
in
a
state
institution,
the
stigma
of
being
labeled
a
murderer
and
a
juvenile
delinquent,
and
the
possibility
of
certification
as
an
adult,
which
in
fact
came
to
pass
here.
and
we
would
submit
that
if
you
look
at
what
happened
below
that
you
will
see
that
this
was
a
court
which
although
it
purported
to
be
a
juvenile
court
was
functioning
with
all
the
harshness
and
all
the
stringency
of
a
criminal
court.
that
this
is
a
court
for
example
which
has
the
power
to
commit
juvenile
delinquents
in
certain
instances
directly
to
the
state
reformatory,
which
is
an
adult
penal
institution.
and
the
whole
pattern
of
the
proceeding
below
is
like
a
criminal
trial
that
charge
arraignment
of
plea,
and
a
trial
there
is
absolutely
no
indication
on
this
record,
that
the
juvenile
court
here
was
functioning
as
juvenile
courts
under
their
theory
are
intended
to
function,
namely
with
therapeutic
concern
for
the
individual,
with
a
view
to
his
treatability,
to
his
possible
rehabilitation.
in
other
words,
this
court
acted
upon
this
boy
with
all
the
harshness
that
a
criminal
court
would
have
acted
but
without
some
of
the
most
important
safeguards
that
any
criminal
defendant
would
have
had,
and
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes.
he
still
should
have
had
bail
during
that
period.
he
would
be
entitled
to
it.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
would
hesitate
to
call
that
a
finding,
your
honor.
the
original
statement
by
the
juvenile
court
judge
which
is
indicative
of
the
standard
of
proof
he
was
applying
was
probable
cause,
but
his
finding
is
one
of
delinquency.
and
the
case
was
reviewed
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
basis
that
this
was
a
finding
in
a
judgment
of
delinquency
applying
civil
standard.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
that's
not
in
the
journal
entry.
the
journal
entry
simply
recites
that
the
court
finds
him
a
delinquent.
the
probable
cause
language
came
at
the
conclusion
of
the
adjudicative
hearing,
and
it
was
adverted
to
by
the
trial
judge
at
that
point.
but
the
journal
entry
when
it
actually
came
out
and
that
is
the
judgment,
stated
that
the
court
finds
him
to
be
a
delinquent
and
the
court
of
appeals
below
reviewed
it
specifically
on
that
basis
that
you
had
a
judgment
of
delinquency
and
they
upheld
it
on
the
civil
standard.
we
would
point
out
that
if
this
boy
had
been
one
week
over
18
instead
of
one
week
over
14
at
the
time
when
this
case
arose,
he
would
have
had
the
rights
if
he
had
been
charged
with
the
same
offense,
second
degree
murder,
to
a
standard
of
proof
beyond
reasonable
doubt,
to
an
impartial
triar
of
fact,
including
trial
by
jury
if
he
desired
it
to
the
protections
of
miranda
versus
arizona,
to
right
to
bail
in
advance
of
trial,
and
freedom
from
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
but
because
he
was
a
juvenile
and
he
was
charged
with
what
the
state
chose
to
label
juvenile
delinquency
in
the
juvenile
court,
he
received
none
of
these
protections
which
have
been
deemed
fundamental
for
persons
accused
of
criminal
offenses.
and
we
submit
that
as
this
court
made
very
clear
in
gault
case,
when
you
have
that
kind
of
gap
between
the
procedures,
particularly
procedures
which
go
to
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process,
that
wide
a
gap
between
juvenile
and
adult
proceedings
that
requires
more
than
mere
verbiage
to
bridge
the
gap.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
if
it
certainly
does
not
appear
on
this
record
and
i
don't
know
of
any,
your
honor.
he
was
treated
worse
than
an
adult
criminal
would
have
been
treated
because
of
the
method
of
his
confinement.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
assume
there's
a
pre-sentence
investigation
in
cases
and
that
you
could
receive
the
same
kind
of
examination
by
the
appropriate
officers
concerned
with
sentencing.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
and
we
think
that's
absolutely
clear
on
the
record,
that
no
adult
defendant
would
have
been
treated
in
the
fashion
that
this
boy
was.
the
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
he
was
exposed
here
to
a
potentiality
as
a
juvenile
of
incarceration
for
up
to
seven
years.
under
the
ohio
criminal
statutes,
a
second
degree
murder,
the
crime
of
which
he
was
charged,
carries
a
life
sentence
but
there's
eligibility
for
parole
after
a
period
of
ten
years
under
the
state's
statute.
so
in
either
case,
you're
dealing
with
a
very
substantial
period
of
incarceration
which
lay
ahead
of
this
boy
as
a
result
of
the
juvenile
proceeding.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
as
i
read
the
statute,
it's
ten
years
before
you're
eligible
for
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no,
i
don't
believe
the
statutes
forbid
--
i'm
not
sure
on
that
point,
your
honor
but
they
provide
for
life
sentence
and
then
say
there
shall
be
eligibility
for
parole
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
the
maximum
penalty
that
the
juvenile
court
could
impose
on
him,
that's
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
death,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
the
order
could
be
a
permanent
commitment
to
the
youth
commission
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
they
can
come
back
to
the
juvenile
court
if
they
think
he's
rehabilitated
for
example
and
asked
that
he
be
released.
there
are
other
types
of
temporary
commitment
orders
which
could
be
entered
under
the
ohio
statute.
to
address
myself
to
the
point
justice
brennan
just
raised
--
well,
i
see
that
my
time's
up,
but
seven
years
incarceration
on
unfair
fact
finding
procedures,
it
seems
that
would
be
a
clear
denial
of
due
process
even
though
he
might
have
received
a
more
substantial
sentence
as
an
adult.
we
have
raised
here
the
--
as
our
first
question
for
review
by
this
court,
the
standard
of
proof
in
juvenile
delinquency
proceedings,
which
we
think
clearly
does
raise
an
issue
of
constitutional
magnitude
because
it
goes
to
the
very
reliability
of
the
guilt
determining
process
to
the
prerequisite
on
which
any
further
action
rest,
mainly
an
adjudication
that
the
boy
has
committed
the
act
charged
and
is
in
fact
in
law
a
delinquent.
and
we
maintain
that
the
standard
which
was
applied
below
both
in
the
juvenile
court
and
by
the
reviewing
court
is
unconstitutional,
and
attested
by
a
proper
permissible
constitutional
standard
that
this
judgment
of
delinquency
cannot
stand.
we
submit
that
the
civil
standard
is
not
a
tolerable
constitutional
standard
where
personal
interests
involve
a
possible
loss
of
liberty
and
reputation
are
involved
as
they
were
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
that
is
all
there
is
before
the
court
in
this
case.
certainly,
we
would
differentiate
proceedings
such
as
neglected
dependency
which
don't
involve
any
misconduct
by
the
child
with
respect
to
the
standard
of
proof.
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
just
recently
wanted
to
invalidate
the
preponderance
test
on
constitutional
grounds
and
law
violation
cases,
sharply
differentiated
neglected
dependency
cases,
so
that
particular
was
not
here.
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
law
violation
case
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
the
implications
of
gault
is
that
it
would
apply
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
if
i
were
in
this
case,
i
would,
but
it's
not
in
this
case
now.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
the
particular
basis
for
the
delinquency
adjudication
there
was
an
act
which
would
be
criminal
and
it
is
argued
that
we're
dealing
with
a
law
violation
case
in
that
sense.
an
act
which
would
be
criminal
and
commitment
by
an
adult,
that
is
entirely
appropriate
to
look
to
the
safeguards
for
persons
accused
of
crime
in
determining
the
constitutional
procedures
in
the
juvenile
courts.
i
think
when
you
get
to
this
area
of
conduct
which
is
unlawful
only
for
juveniles
such
as
truancy
or
incorrigibility.
you
earn
something
of
a
gray
area
there.
and
as
i
said,
that
particular
issue
is
not
presented
by
this
case
because
this
is
a
pure
criminal
law
violation
case
and
the
court
below
so
found.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may
say
just
one
further
word
on
the
finality
question,
i
would
just
like
to
specify
the
dates
here
for
the
court
that
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
on
april
11,
1967.
and
the
binding
over
order
of
the
juvenile
court
was
on
april
24,
1967.
and
it
occurred
during
this
period
of
time
when
there
was
no
longer
a
stay
in
effect
as
to
further
juvenile
court
proceedings.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
you
granted.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
at
that
time,
the
turnover
--
when
certiorari
was
filed
for
the
turnover,
the
transfer
order
had
not
been
entered.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
believe
that
the
record
will
show
that
there
was
a
request
for
a
state
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
it's
not
in
the
current
record
that
i
have
here
but
it
maybe
in
the
file.
my
understanding
is
that
there
was
an
order
by
this
court
which
denied
the
stay
of
further
proceedings.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes
you
did.
so
you
have
this
in
the
regular
period
when
these
proceedings
were
unable
to
go
forth
below.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
finality,
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
a
decision
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
new
york
ex
rel
bryant
v.
zimmerman,
which
we've
decided
on
page
5
of
our
reply
brief
which
involved
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
advance
with
trial
by
someone
who
was
under
indictment.
and
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
was
denied
at
the
state
courts
and
review
was
sought
in
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
while
they
were
still
depending
indictment
in
the
state
courts.
and
this
court
held
that
that
was
a
final
judgment.
that
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
is
independent,
adversary
and
both
adapted,
and
directed
to
the
enforcement
of
a
most
important
personal
right
and
to
entertain
that
appeal.
and
we
think
that
the
same
situation
prevails
here
with
the
juvenile
proceeding
which
was
an
independent
proceeding
and
which
did
end
in
the
adjudication
of
delinquency
with
very
serious
consequences
for
the
juvenile.
we
think
mr.
morehart
is
simply
asking
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
courts
of
ohio
as
to
the
appealability
of
this
order
under
state
law.
with
respect
to
the
evidence
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes
and
i
believe
in
that
question,
you
look
at
the
incidents
of
the
judge
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
it
would
have
had
a
variety
of
dispositional
orders
open
to
it.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
there
was
a
disposition
order
here,
there
would
have
been
a
further
order
which
could
have
been
still
temporary
in
nature
or
which
could
have
been
a
permanent
commitment,
which
could
have
been
probation,
which
could
have
been
a
fine.
they
have
this
continuing
jurisdiction
and
they
could
modify
their
orders
even
from
time
to
time
so
that
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
there's
no
specific
provision
of
course
requiring
the
court
to
do
that
or
even
setting
a
time
limit
within
which
the
court
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well
a
statute
doesn't
say
to
the
contrary
that
there
is
no
provision
in
the
statute
which
is
comparable
to
the
provision
of
the
federal
criminal
rule.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
would
have
thought
that
the
judge
would
have
to
do
something
or
else
it
would
be
susceptible
to
habeas
corpus.
on
the
evidentiary
point
which
mr.
morehart
had
talked
about,
i
would
like
to
just
direct
the
court's
attention
to
page
271
of
the
record
which
is
a
critical
passage
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
the
court
below
affirm
this
judgment
by
the
use
of
the
civil
standard
but
they
also
had
at
the
statement
which
we
submit
must
have
been
considered
with
great
care
that
the
evidence
contained
in
the
record
fails
to
disclose
any
thorough
investigation
by
officials
toward
eliminating
the
possibility
that
mrs.
gladys
willard
may
have
been
killed
by
some
other
person.
mr.
morehart
says
that
he
assumes
that
the
boy
did
it
and
i
submit
that
that
is
all
you
have
here
in
assumption
and
not
based
on
any
tolerable
standard
of
guilt
when
liberty
and
reputation
are
at
stake.
and
that
is
not
a
sufficient
basis
to
impose
the
kind
of
sanctions
that
are
available
here.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
as
i
understand
in
ohio,
he
is
entitled
to
do
on
a
basis
of
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
as
if
it
were
an
ordinary
garden
variety
negligence
of
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
in
this
case
where
the
violation
of
a
criminal
statute
was
involved,
they
must
simply
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
he
violated
the
criminal
statute.
and
that's
sufficient
to
adjudicate
in
the
delinquent.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
the
state
statute
i
believe
refers
to
substantial
and
credible
evidence.
2937.13
says
that
the
court
while
weighing
the
credibility
witness
shall
not
be
required
to
pass
on
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
any
finding
requiring
the
accused
to
stand
trial
on
any
charge
shall
be
based
solely
under
presence
of
substantial
credible
evidence
thereof.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes
which
is
even
a
lower
standard
than
the
preponderance
standard?
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i'd
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
on
the
first
point
on
the
adult
confinement
to
page
253
of
the
record
which
is
the
journal
entry
of
the
district
court
of
appeals,
which
ordered
buddy
released
from
the
confinement,
and
in
which
he
was
then
held
in
the
adult
jail.
after
a
personal
view
and
i
said
from
our
view,
we
find
that
buddy
is
confined
in
a
portion
of
the
jail
used
for
adults
and
that
an
adult
is
now
in
fact
confined
in
an
adjoining
cell
in
the
same
room.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
that
was
personal
viewing
by
the
court
of
appeals.
with
respect
to
the
solitary,
it
was
repeatedly
asserted
and
never
denied
in
motions
for
release
to
the
court
that
he
was
being
held
in
solitary.
there's
no
evidence
that
anyone
else
was
confined
with
him
and
any
other
juvenile
and
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
testimony
of
his
mother
that's
up
here.
it's
at
page
99
of
the
record
in
which
she
was
asked
to
have
an
opinion
as
to
what
continued
and
enforced
incarceration
in
that
cell
as
to
whether
it
would
affect
buddy's
mental
well
being.
and
she
answered,
“yes
sir.
i
think
anybody
being
penned
up
like
that
by
themselves
for
as
long
as
he
has
been
–
or
as
long
as
he
might
have
to
be.
i
think
even
myself
or
even
an
adult
that
would
work
on
your
mind
it
couldn't
help
but
do
that
just
penned
up
there
all
day
long.”
and
then
she
said
in
response
to
a
further
question.
well,
when
he
sits
there
all
day
long,
sometimes
he
doesn't
say
much
when
we
go
in.
i
think
his
mind
might
be
dulled
by
being
there.
there's
nothing
for
him
to
do,
just
sit
there.
it
would
affect
your
mind
to
or
anybody's.
so
we
think
that
there's
an
ample
predicate.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
realized
that
this
creates
a
problem
as
to
what
remedy
would
be
affected
at
this
time
after
he
has
been
found
to
be
a
delinquent.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
we
think
that
it
would,
your
honor
but
for
the
denial
of
a
fundamental
constitutional
right
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
you're
right.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
the
right
to
be
from
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
such
as
this
boy
was
projected
to
as
a
fundamental
constitutional
right.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
we
think
it
should
invalidate
the
proceedings
against
him
with
respect
to
whether
he
can
be
retried.
we
think
that
question
turns
on
the
resolution
of
the
standard
of
proof
and
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
under
a
constitutional
standard.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
those
two
questions
are
not
related
your
honor.
i'm
not
saying
that
because
he
was
subjected
to
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
that
he
cannot
be
retried.
i
think
that
he
could
be
retried
if
that
were
the
only
ground
that
we
had.
i
am
saying
that
i
think
the
procedures
carried
on
below
are
sufficiently
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
it's
our
last
argument,
your
honor.
i
hesitate
to
call
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
would
certainly
say
that
the
state
is
going
to
try
juvenile's
criminals,
confine
them
as
criminals,
and
punish
them
as
criminals
that
it
cannot
obey
constitutional
obligations
by
--
pardon
me?
confine
them
as
criminals,
punish
them,
impose
punishment
on
them
as
criminals
that
it
can't.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
we
think
our
arguments
that
go
to
the
invalid
fact
finding
procedure
will
amply
dispose
off
this
point
and
will
show
the
invalidity
of
the
juvenile
delinquency
adjudication,
your
honor.
we're
not
relying
on
the
punishment
factor
solely
to
invalidate
the
delinquency
of
finding.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no
it
does
not
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
the
record
is
silent
on
that.
for
these
reasons,
we
pray
that
the
judgment
below
be
reversed.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
answer
to
the
question
that's
been
raised
here
with
respect
to
the
specific
charge
against
this
boy,
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
page
12
of
the
record
which
contains
the
complaint
that
was
filed
in
the
juvenile
court
and
it
alleges
that
he
is
a
delinquent
child
and
that
he
unlawfully
killed
mrs.
willard
in
violation
of
section
2901.05
of
the
code
of
ohio,
which
is
the
ohio
second
degree
murder
statute.
so
that
was
the
allegation
upon
which
this
case
was
tried
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
understand
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
we
think
that
you
do
have
a
final
judgment
here
under
the
test
that
this
court
has
laid
down
for
finality
that
the
juvenile
proceeding
and
the
adult
criminal
preceding
are
separate
proceedings
under
the
law
of
ohio.
that
you
had
a
juvenile
delinquency
proceeding
which
was
a
trial
on
the
merits
of
the
delinquency
charge
and
it
has
resulted
in
a
final
judgment
adjudicating
the
boy
to
be
a
delinquent.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
there
was
not
a
final
order
of
disposition,
your
honor.
there
was
what
is
called
--
and
the
order
recites
a
temporary
commitment
to
the
ohio
youth
commission
so
that
there
was
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
for
examination.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
he
was
returned
following
that.
but
the
adjudication
of
delinquency
gave
the
juvenile
court
power
to
act
coarsely
on
his
person,
power
to
commit
him,
legal
custody,
physical
custody
of
the
boy
under
ohio
law
passed
thereby
from
his
parents
to
the
state.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
the
judgment
of
the
juvenile
court
is
reversed
here,
your
honor
we
believe
that
the
indictment
falls
with
it
and
that
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
under
the
ohio
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
under
the
ohio
statute,
there
is
no
criminal
jurisdiction
until
there
has
been
a
valid
certification
of
the
boy
by
the
juvenile
court.
in
other
words,
the
juvenile
court
has
exclusive
criminal
jurisdiction
until
it
makes
a
transfer
to
the
adult
court.
and
we
believe
that
if
the
judgment
of
delinquency,
which
is
a
prerequisite
under
ohio
law
to
a
valid
transfer
falls
that
the
indictment
falls
with
it
and
it
will
be
subject
to
a
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
court
of
common
pleas.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
we
have
directed
ourselves
in
the
reply
brief
to
the
issue
both
of
finality
and
to
whether
the
possibility
of
certification
should
have
any
effect
on
the
finality
of
the
judgment.
and
that
we
think
we've
demonstrated
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
consequences
which
state
law
attaches
to
this
judgment
of
delinquency
--
that
you
do
have
a
final
judgment
and
that
the
court
is
not
being
asked
to
do
a
useless
thing
here.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
don't
know
what
the
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
we
don't
admit
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
your
honor
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
the
national
council
so
states,
your
honor.
but
we
think
that
statute
is
clear
that
he
must
be
adjudicated
a
delinquent
and
that
certification
or
binding
over
is
simply
another
form
of
disposition,
which
is
available
to
the
juvenile
court
judge.
once
he's
made
a
finding
of
delinquency
so
that
this
was
in
substance
and
to
all
intents
and
purposes
a
delinquency
proceeding,
which
could
have
resulted
in
a
variety
of
possible
orders,
among
them
certification,
but
there
can
be
no
question
as
to
the
finality
of
the
judgment
which
was
entered.
it
had
the
immediate
effect
of
adjudicating
this
boy
a
juvenile
delinquent
with
all
the
attendant's
stigma
and
it
labeled
him
a
murderer,
had
found
that
he
had
committed
the
crime
of
murder.
will
you
call
it
delinquency
or
anything
else?
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
as
an
adult,
he
has
not
been
found
to
be
guilty
of
the
crime
of
murder.
he
has
been
found
by
the
juvenile
court
and
the
decision
is
to
be
confirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--
to
be
a
delinquent
by
reason
of
having
committed
the
act
of
murder.
so
to
all
intents
and
purposes,
he
has
been
labeled
with
the
stigma
of
a
murderer.
we
would
point
out
that
the
certification
of
whatever
happens
to
him
now
isn't
going
to
undo
that.
you
have
a
separate
proceeding
here;
a
juvenile
proceeding
which
has
resulted
in
a
final
judgment
of
delinquency.
and
whatever
happens
to
him
in
the
subsequent
adult
proceeding,
you
were
still
going
to
have
this
judgment
of
delinquency.
you
had
incarceration
pursuant
to
the
judgment
which
lasted
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
before
the
binding
over
took
place.
so
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
judgment
acted
coercively
on
this
boy,
not
the
parents.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
they've
lost
jurisdiction
by
transferring
the
case
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
whether
they
would
be
able
to
reassert
jurisdiction
by
a
new
proceeding
is
another
matter,
but
we
do
assert
that
we
can
get
the
indictment
and
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
would
say
you
have
two
things;
you
have
a
judgment
of
delinquency,
and
you
have
what
is
called
a
temporary
order
of
commitment.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
those
are
the
results
of
the
juvenile
court
judgment.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
in
this
particular
case,
that
is
right.
we
are
not
raising
questions
as
to
the
validity
of
the
adult
proceeding
at
this
time.
that
proceeding
and
any
issues
that
may
be
raised
therein
are
not
now
before
this
court.
we're
asking
you
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
delinquency
which
was
entered
in
the
firm
below.
and
we
believe
that
we
are
then
entitled
to
take
the
appropriate
procedural
steps
in
the
state
courts
to
have
the
adult
proceeding
dismissed.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
we
believe
that
under
a
fair
reading
of
the
state
statute
since
a
valid
finding
of
delinquency
is
a
prerequisite
to
transfer
that
the
adult
courts
would
not
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes
it
does,
your
honor.
i
cannot
say
any
authority
to
you
one
way
or
another
on
that
proposition,
but
i
think
that
the
statute
is
clear
here.
that
the
whole
framework
requires
that
the
adult
court
receives
jurisdiction
only
when
the
juvenile
court
has
validly
adjudicated
someone
as
delinquent,
and
has
validly
transferred
the
case
so
as
to
enable
the
adult
court
to
act.
and
we
do
submit
that
we
can
take
a
judgment
of
reversal
on
this
court
and
can
get
the
adult
proceeding
dismissed.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
since
these
questions
have
been
raised
and
decided
by
the
state
courts,
we
submit
that
they
are
properly
here
now
and
of
course
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
on
a
double
jeopardy
basis
perhaps,
your
honor.
this
is
an
argument
that
we
have
raised
in
the
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
because
you
have
a
state
system
here
that
seems
to
operate
by
adjudicating
someone
a
delinquent
after
a
trial,
that
provides
for
subsequent
trial
as
an
adult.
and
we
would
think
that
this
raises
substantial
double
jeopardy
problems,
although
they're
not
before
the
court
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
and
the
procedures
by
which
that
finding
was
arrived
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
believe
that
it
was,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
after
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
dismissed
the
appeal
for
one
of
a
substantial
question,
substantial
constitutional
question
that
during
that
interim
period
before
relief
was
sought
in
this
court
that
the
juvenile
court
exercised
authority
to
bind
this
boy
over.
there
was
no
stay
at
that
point.
there
had
been
a
stay
at
juvenile
court
proceedings
up
until
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
acted
in
it.
it
was
during
that
interim
period
that
these
further
proceedings
were
able
to
take
place.
we
of
course
do
take
the
position
and
we
think
it's
clear
on
the
record
below
that
what
you
had
here
was
a
delinquency
trial
on
the
merits.
what
took
place
here
was
agreed
by
everyone
--
the
lawyers,
the
judges,
the
reviewing
courts,
everyone
up
to
this
point
via
delinquency
trial
on
the
merits.
it
was
not
in
the
nature
of
a
binding
over
proceeding
or
a
preliminary
hearing
and
this
again
was
in
accord
with
our
view
of
the
clear
and
unambiguous
language
of
the
ohio
statute
as
requiring
an
adjudication
of
delinquency
after
a
trial
on
the
merits
before
any
further
dispositional
order
can
be
entered.
and
i
would
therefore
like
to
address
myself
to
the
procedural
issues
than
which
we
contend
to
arise
with
respect
to
a
court's
power
to
adjudicate
someone,
a
delinquent
face
on
a
charge
of
a
law
violation.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
yes
we
do,
your
honor.
this
has
been
held
to
be
a
final
unappealable
judgment
by
the
state
courts
of
ohio.
and
furthermore,
the
consequences
that
attach
to
the
judgment
of
delinquency
under
the
law
of
the
state
meet
to
test
for
finality
which
this
court
has
laid
down
in
determining
its
own
jurisdiction
under
the
jurisdictional
statute.
in
other
words,
you
had
immediate
and
enormous
consequences
on
this
boy
from
the
delinquency
adjudication
itself,
namely
an
order
of
commitment
and
the
delinquency
adjudication,
which
banned
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
believe
it's
contained
in
the
state's
opposition
to
certiorari.
i
believe
that
they
bring
it
to
the
court's
attention,
so
that
it
was
before
this
court
at
the
time
that
the
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
assume
that
there
was
but
it's
not
part
of
the
record
and
it
is
not
in
the
record
before
this
court.
in
other
words,
it
was
not
brought
up
in
the
record,
which
we
have
here
from
the
juvenile
court.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
believe
that
the
--
would
you
indulge
me
for
just
--
just
one
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
only
until
the
ohio
supreme
court
acted.
the
juvenile
court
proceedings
were
stayed
but
after
the
ohio
supreme
court
dismissed
the
appeal,
at
that
point,
there
was
no
further
stay
against
juvenile
court
proceedings.
and
it
was
thereafter
that
the
transfer
and
the
binding
over
ensued.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
the
record
is
certainly
ambiguous
about
that
and
due
to
the
fact
that
the
juvenile
court
in
effect
made
conflicting
statements
on
the
point.
but
we
don't
think
that
the
subjective
intent
of
the
juvenile
court,
whatever
that
may
have
been,
would
be
relevant
because
the
point
is,
that
this
was
a
delinquency
trial.
it
was
treated
as
a
delinquency
trial
by
everyone
involved.
it
resulted
as
it
must
in
the
ohio
law
in
our
view
in
a
judgment
of
delinquency.
and
therefore,
for
review
purposes,
it
should
be
treated
just
as
if
he
had
made
some
other
order
of
disposition
such
as
sending
the
boy
to
the
industrial
school
until
he
was
21,
or
entering
a
temporary
order
of
commitment,
which
can
be
indefinitely
renewed
until
21,
which
is
another
power
of
the
court.
in
other
words,
the
juvenile
court
has
a
whole
panoply
of
disposition
orders.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
we
think
that
the
adult
criminal
cases
that
are
dealt
with
sentencing
are
distinguishable
for
several
reasons.
one
being
that,
it's
simply
as
a
matter
of
form,
you
don't
have
a
judgment
in
a
criminal
case
until
you
have
the
sentence
entered
and
here
we
do
have
what
is
called
the
judgment
which
was
reviewed
as
a
judgment
and
healthier
judgment
by
the
ohio
court
of
appeals.
furthermore,
you
have
a
difference
in
the
way
juvenile
and
adult
courts
operate
in
the
sense
that
a
juvenile
court,
once
it
adjudicates
someone
a
delinquent,
it
has
a
continuing
supervisory
jurisdiction
over
a
juvenile
and
can
make
dispositional
orders
of
a
temporary
nature
and
it
may
modify
them
from
time
to
time.
in
other
words,
it
has
a
kind
of
continuing
authority
that
an
adult
criminal
court
does
not
have.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no,
i
think
certainly
not
and
i
think
the
question
is
precisely
the
same.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
that
is
true.
the
questions,
the
constitutional
issues
raised
would
be
precisely
the
same
in
our
view.
and
we
think
furthermore
that
there
is
an
advantage,
a
distinct
advantage
from
the
standpoint
of
judicial
administration.
in
reviewing
the
case
at
this
point
because
as
this
court
will
recall
in
kent
versus
united
states,
where
you
did
not
have
a
review
of
the
transfer
letter
until
after
the
adult
criminal
trial
had
taken
place.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
at
that
particular
moment
in
time
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
if
this
were
in
fact
a
preliminary
hearing
and
if
the
ohio
statutes
provided
for
a
proceeding
in
the
nature
of
a
preliminary
hearing,
which
they
do
not,
then
i
think
we
would
have
a
different
constitutional
question.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
that
would
be
whether
there
was
fair
notice
of
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
if
it
were
not
in
delinquency
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
that
is,
if
it
were
a
delinquency
trial,
if
it
were
not
a
delinquency
trial
on
the
merits
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
if
the
state
law
provided
for
such
a
proceeding,
yes,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
we
think
it
provides
to
a
more
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
we
think
that
that's
a
necessary
reading
of
the
statute.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
if
we're
wrong
on
that,
we
haven't
been
told
so
by
the
state
courts
because
we
think
that
the
state
court
in
this
case
reviewed
this
as
a
delinquency
judgment
and
i've
held
up
that
he
was
charged
with
delinquency
and
he
was
adjudicated
to
be
a
delinquent,
and
we
would
take
that
to
be
conclusive
of
what
the
nature
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
think
that
the
only
persons
who
could
tell
us
that
would
be
the
state
courts
and
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
then
we
would
have
a
different
constitutional
issue
raised
than
the
ones
that
we
are
raising
here.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
if
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
think
as
a
matter
of
form,
we
would
have
to
make
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
and
profit
the
judgment
of
this
court,
to
give
the
courts
below
a
basis
for
doing
that.
but
we
think
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
getting
that
done.
once
you
notice
--
once
you
knock
out
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
still
open
to
the
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
we
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
want
to
say
your
honor
it
isn't
just
my
reading
of
it.
it's
the
reading
of
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
in
this
very
case,
which
said
this
boy
is
alleged
to
be
a
juvenile
delinquent.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
juvenile
delinquency.
we
uphold
it
under
preponderance
of
the
evidence
test.
we
reject
other
constitutional
claims
because
this
is
in
the
nature
of
a
juvenile
delinquency
proceeding
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
think
we
should
still
have
notice
that
they
were
proposing
to
do
x.
and
what
we
had
noticed
was
--
what
we
had
notice
of
it
was
this
was
a
delinquency
trial
on
the
merits.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
to
get
a
ruling
on
--
from
the
state
court
on
the
matter
of
state
law,
i'm
not
aware
that
there
is
a
statute
of
ohio
that
enables
you
to
do
that.
but
again,
we
do
submit
that
this
particular
question
is
really
foreclosed
by
the
decision
of
the
ohio
court
in
this
very
case,
holding
that
this
is
a
final
judgment
of
delinquency.
i
don't
have
very
much
time
left
to
argue
the
merits
here,
but
i
would
like
to
indicate
what
our
views
are
on
the
assumption
which
we
think
is
undeniable
on
the
record
and
under
the
statutory
framework
here,
that
this
was
a
trial
of
delinquency,
no
different
from
any
other
trial
on
the
merits
of
a
charge
of
delinquency.
and
here,
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
first,
this
was
a
proceeding
in
which
the
charge
of
delinquency
was
based
solely
upon
the
violation
of
a
state
criminal
statute
and
a
serious
state
criminal
statute
at
that
of
murder.
this
was
not
a
case
in
the
court
below
so
held
in
which
an
adjudication
of
delinquency
could
have
been
upheld
on
any
other
ground.
and
this
was
a
proceeding
which
as
i've
already
outlined
carried
various
serious
consequences
for
the
juvenile,
a
possibility
of
seven
years
incarceration
in
a
state
institution,
the
stigma
of
being
labeled
a
murderer
and
a
juvenile
delinquent,
and
the
possibility
of
certification
as
an
adult,
which
in
fact
came
to
pass
here.
and
we
would
submit
that
if
you
look
at
what
happened
below
that
you
will
see
that
this
was
a
court
which
although
it
purported
to
be
a
juvenile
court
was
functioning
with
all
the
harshness
and
all
the
stringency
of
a
criminal
court.
that
this
is
a
court
for
example
which
has
the
power
to
commit
juvenile
delinquents
in
certain
instances
directly
to
the
state
reformatory,
which
is
an
adult
penal
institution.
and
the
whole
pattern
of
the
proceeding
below
is
like
a
criminal
trial
that
charge
arraignment
of
plea,
and
a
trial
there
is
absolutely
no
indication
on
this
record,
that
the
juvenile
court
here
was
functioning
as
juvenile
courts
under
their
theory
are
intended
to
function,
namely
with
therapeutic
concern
for
the
individual,
with
a
view
to
his
treatability,
to
his
possible
rehabilitation.
in
other
words,
this
court
acted
upon
this
boy
with
all
the
harshness
that
a
criminal
court
would
have
acted
but
without
some
of
the
most
important
safeguards
that
any
criminal
defendant
would
have
had,
and
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes.
he
still
should
have
had
bail
during
that
period.
he
would
be
entitled
to
it.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
would
hesitate
to
call
that
a
finding,
your
honor.
the
original
statement
by
the
juvenile
court
judge
which
is
indicative
of
the
standard
of
proof
he
was
applying
was
probable
cause,
but
his
finding
is
one
of
delinquency.
and
the
case
was
reviewed
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
basis
that
this
was
a
finding
in
a
judgment
of
delinquency
applying
civil
standard.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
that's
not
in
the
journal
entry.
the
journal
entry
simply
recites
that
the
court
finds
him
a
delinquent.
the
probable
cause
language
came
at
the
conclusion
of
the
adjudicative
hearing,
and
it
was
adverted
to
by
the
trial
judge
at
that
point.
but
the
journal
entry
when
it
actually
came
out
and
that
is
the
judgment,
stated
that
the
court
finds
him
to
be
a
delinquent
and
the
court
of
appeals
below
reviewed
it
specifically
on
that
basis
that
you
had
a
judgment
of
delinquency
and
they
upheld
it
on
the
civil
standard.
we
would
point
out
that
if
this
boy
had
been
one
week
over
18
instead
of
one
week
over
14
at
the
time
when
this
case
arose,
he
would
have
had
the
rights
if
he
had
been
charged
with
the
same
offense,
second
degree
murder,
to
a
standard
of
proof
beyond
reasonable
doubt,
to
an
impartial
triar
of
fact,
including
trial
by
jury
if
he
desired
it
to
the
protections
of
miranda
versus
arizona,
to
right
to
bail
in
advance
of
trial,
and
freedom
from
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
but
because
he
was
a
juvenile
and
he
was
charged
with
what
the
state
chose
to
label
juvenile
delinquency
in
the
juvenile
court,
he
received
none
of
these
protections
which
have
been
deemed
fundamental
for
persons
accused
of
criminal
offenses.
and
we
submit
that
as
this
court
made
very
clear
in
gault
case,
when
you
have
that
kind
of
gap
between
the
procedures,
particularly
procedures
which
go
to
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process,
that
wide
a
gap
between
juvenile
and
adult
proceedings
that
requires
more
than
mere
verbiage
to
bridge
the
gap.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
if
it
certainly
does
not
appear
on
this
record
and
i
don't
know
of
any,
your
honor.
he
was
treated
worse
than
an
adult
criminal
would
have
been
treated
because
of
the
method
of
his
confinement.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
assume
there's
a
pre-sentence
investigation
in
cases
and
that
you
could
receive
the
same
kind
of
examination
by
the
appropriate
officers
concerned
with
sentencing.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
and
we
think
that's
absolutely
clear
on
the
record,
that
no
adult
defendant
would
have
been
treated
in
the
fashion
that
this
boy
was.
the
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
he
was
exposed
here
to
a
potentiality
as
a
juvenile
of
incarceration
for
up
to
seven
years.
under
the
ohio
criminal
statutes,
a
second
degree
murder,
the
crime
of
which
he
was
charged,
carries
a
life
sentence
but
there's
eligibility
for
parole
after
a
period
of
ten
years
under
the
state's
statute.
so
in
either
case,
you're
dealing
with
a
very
substantial
period
of
incarceration
which
lay
ahead
of
this
boy
as
a
result
of
the
juvenile
proceeding.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
as
i
read
the
statute,
it's
ten
years
before
you're
eligible
for
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no,
i
don't
believe
the
statutes
forbid
--
i'm
not
sure
on
that
point,
your
honor
but
they
provide
for
life
sentence
and
then
say
there
shall
be
eligibility
for
parole
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
the
maximum
penalty
that
the
juvenile
court
could
impose
on
him,
that's
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
death,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
the
order
could
be
a
permanent
commitment
to
the
youth
commission
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
they
can
come
back
to
the
juvenile
court
if
they
think
he's
rehabilitated
for
example
and
asked
that
he
be
released.
there
are
other
types
of
temporary
commitment
orders
which
could
be
entered
under
the
ohio
statute.
to
address
myself
to
the
point
justice
brennan
just
raised
--
well,
i
see
that
my
time's
up,
but
seven
years
incarceration
on
unfair
fact
finding
procedures,
it
seems
that
would
be
a
clear
denial
of
due
process
even
though
he
might
have
received
a
more
substantial
sentence
as
an
adult.
we
have
raised
here
the
--
as
our
first
question
for
review
by
this
court,
the
standard
of
proof
in
juvenile
delinquency
proceedings,
which
we
think
clearly
does
raise
an
issue
of
constitutional
magnitude
because
it
goes
to
the
very
reliability
of
the
guilt
determining
process
to
the
prerequisite
on
which
any
further
action
rest,
mainly
an
adjudication
that
the
boy
has
committed
the
act
charged
and
is
in
fact
in
law
a
delinquent.
and
we
maintain
that
the
standard
which
was
applied
below
both
in
the
juvenile
court
and
by
the
reviewing
court
is
unconstitutional,
and
attested
by
a
proper
permissible
constitutional
standard
that
this
judgment
of
delinquency
cannot
stand.
we
submit
that
the
civil
standard
is
not
a
tolerable
constitutional
standard
where
personal
interests
involve
a
possible
loss
of
liberty
and
reputation
are
involved
as
they
were
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
that
is
all
there
is
before
the
court
in
this
case.
certainly,
we
would
differentiate
proceedings
such
as
neglected
dependency
which
don't
involve
any
misconduct
by
the
child
with
respect
to
the
standard
of
proof.
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
just
recently
wanted
to
invalidate
the
preponderance
test
on
constitutional
grounds
and
law
violation
cases,
sharply
differentiated
neglected
dependency
cases,
so
that
particular
was
not
here.
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
law
violation
case
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
the
implications
of
gault
is
that
it
would
apply
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
if
i
were
in
this
case,
i
would,
but
it's
not
in
this
case
now.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
the
particular
basis
for
the
delinquency
adjudication
there
was
an
act
which
would
be
criminal
and
it
is
argued
that
we're
dealing
with
a
law
violation
case
in
that
sense.
an
act
which
would
be
criminal
and
commitment
by
an
adult,
that
is
entirely
appropriate
to
look
to
the
safeguards
for
persons
accused
of
crime
in
determining
the
constitutional
procedures
in
the
juvenile
courts.
i
think
when
you
get
to
this
area
of
conduct
which
is
unlawful
only
for
juveniles
such
as
truancy
or
incorrigibility.
you
earn
something
of
a
gray
area
there.
and
as
i
said,
that
particular
issue
is
not
presented
by
this
case
because
this
is
a
pure
criminal
law
violation
case
and
the
court
below
so
found.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may
say
just
one
further
word
on
the
finality
question,
i
would
just
like
to
specify
the
dates
here
for
the
court
that
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
on
april
11,
1967.
and
the
binding
over
order
of
the
juvenile
court
was
on
april
24,
1967.
and
it
occurred
during
this
period
of
time
when
there
was
no
longer
a
stay
in
effect
as
to
further
juvenile
court
proceedings.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
you
granted.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
at
that
time,
the
turnover
--
when
certiorari
was
filed
for
the
turnover,
the
transfer
order
had
not
been
entered.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
believe
that
the
record
will
show
that
there
was
a
request
for
a
state
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
it's
not
in
the
current
record
that
i
have
here
but
it
maybe
in
the
file.
my
understanding
is
that
there
was
an
order
by
this
court
which
denied
the
stay
of
further
proceedings.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes
you
did.
so
you
have
this
in
the
regular
period
when
these
proceedings
were
unable
to
go
forth
below.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
finality,
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
a
decision
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
new
york
ex
rel
bryant
v.
zimmerman,
which
we've
decided
on
page
5
of
our
reply
brief
which
involved
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
advance
with
trial
by
someone
who
was
under
indictment.
and
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
was
denied
at
the
state
courts
and
review
was
sought
in
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
while
they
were
still
depending
indictment
in
the
state
courts.
and
this
court
held
that
that
was
a
final
judgment.
that
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
is
independent,
adversary
and
both
adapted,
and
directed
to
the
enforcement
of
a
most
important
personal
right
and
to
entertain
that
appeal.
and
we
think
that
the
same
situation
prevails
here
with
the
juvenile
proceeding
which
was
an
independent
proceeding
and
which
did
end
in
the
adjudication
of
delinquency
with
very
serious
consequences
for
the
juvenile.
we
think
mr.
morehart
is
simply
asking
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
courts
of
ohio
as
to
the
appealability
of
this
order
under
state
law.
with
respect
to
the
evidence
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes
and
i
believe
in
that
question,
you
look
at
the
incidents
of
the
judge
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
it
would
have
had
a
variety
of
dispositional
orders
open
to
it.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
there
was
a
disposition
order
here,
there
would
have
been
a
further
order
which
could
have
been
still
temporary
in
nature
or
which
could
have
been
a
permanent
commitment,
which
could
have
been
probation,
which
could
have
been
a
fine.
they
have
this
continuing
jurisdiction
and
they
could
modify
their
orders
even
from
time
to
time
so
that
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
there's
no
specific
provision
of
course
requiring
the
court
to
do
that
or
even
setting
a
time
limit
within
which
the
court
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well
a
statute
doesn't
say
to
the
contrary
that
there
is
no
provision
in
the
statute
which
is
comparable
to
the
provision
of
the
federal
criminal
rule.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
would
have
thought
that
the
judge
would
have
to
do
something
or
else
it
would
be
susceptible
to
habeas
corpus.
on
the
evidentiary
point
which
mr.
morehart
had
talked
about,
i
would
like
to
just
direct
the
court's
attention
to
page
271
of
the
record
which
is
a
critical
passage
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
the
court
below
affirm
this
judgment
by
the
use
of
the
civil
standard
but
they
also
had
at
the
statement
which
we
submit
must
have
been
considered
with
great
care
that
the
evidence
contained
in
the
record
fails
to
disclose
any
thorough
investigation
by
officials
toward
eliminating
the
possibility
that
mrs.
gladys
willard
may
have
been
killed
by
some
other
person.
mr.
morehart
says
that
he
assumes
that
the
boy
did
it
and
i
submit
that
that
is
all
you
have
here
in
assumption
and
not
based
on
any
tolerable
standard
of
guilt
when
liberty
and
reputation
are
at
stake.
and
that
is
not
a
sufficient
basis
to
impose
the
kind
of
sanctions
that
are
available
here.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
as
i
understand
in
ohio,
he
is
entitled
to
do
on
a
basis
of
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
as
if
it
were
an
ordinary
garden
variety
negligence
of
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
in
this
case
where
the
violation
of
a
criminal
statute
was
involved,
they
must
simply
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
he
violated
the
criminal
statute.
and
that's
sufficient
to
adjudicate
in
the
delinquent.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
the
state
statute
i
believe
refers
to
substantial
and
credible
evidence.
2937.13
says
that
the
court
while
weighing
the
credibility
witness
shall
not
be
required
to
pass
on
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
any
finding
requiring
the
accused
to
stand
trial
on
any
charge
shall
be
based
solely
under
presence
of
substantial
credible
evidence
thereof.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes
which
is
even
a
lower
standard
than
the
preponderance
standard?
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i'd
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
on
the
first
point
on
the
adult
confinement
to
page
253
of
the
record
which
is
the
journal
entry
of
the
district
court
of
appeals,
which
ordered
buddy
released
from
the
confinement,
and
in
which
he
was
then
held
in
the
adult
jail.
after
a
personal
view
and
i
said
from
our
view,
we
find
that
buddy
is
confined
in
a
portion
of
the
jail
used
for
adults
and
that
an
adult
is
now
in
fact
confined
in
an
adjoining
cell
in
the
same
room.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
that
was
personal
viewing
by
the
court
of
appeals.
with
respect
to
the
solitary,
it
was
repeatedly
asserted
and
never
denied
in
motions
for
release
to
the
court
that
he
was
being
held
in
solitary.
there's
no
evidence
that
anyone
else
was
confined
with
him
and
any
other
juvenile
and
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
testimony
of
his
mother
that's
up
here.
it's
at
page
99
of
the
record
in
which
she
was
asked
to
have
an
opinion
as
to
what
continued
and
enforced
incarceration
in
that
cell
as
to
whether
it
would
affect
buddy's
mental
well
being.
and
she
answered,
“yes
sir.
i
think
anybody
being
penned
up
like
that
by
themselves
for
as
long
as
he
has
been
–
or
as
long
as
he
might
have
to
be.
i
think
even
myself
or
even
an
adult
that
would
work
on
your
mind
it
couldn't
help
but
do
that
just
penned
up
there
all
day
long.”
and
then
she
said
in
response
to
a
further
question.
well,
when
he
sits
there
all
day
long,
sometimes
he
doesn't
say
much
when
we
go
in.
i
think
his
mind
might
be
dulled
by
being
there.
there's
nothing
for
him
to
do,
just
sit
there.
it
would
affect
your
mind
to
or
anybody's.
so
we
think
that
there's
an
ample
predicate.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
realized
that
this
creates
a
problem
as
to
what
remedy
would
be
affected
at
this
time
after
he
has
been
found
to
be
a
delinquent.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
we
think
that
it
would,
your
honor
but
for
the
denial
of
a
fundamental
constitutional
right
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
you're
right.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
the
right
to
be
from
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
such
as
this
boy
was
projected
to
as
a
fundamental
constitutional
right.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
we
think
it
should
invalidate
the
proceedings
against
him
with
respect
to
whether
he
can
be
retried.
we
think
that
question
turns
on
the
resolution
of
the
standard
of
proof
and
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
under
a
constitutional
standard.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
those
two
questions
are
not
related
your
honor.
i'm
not
saying
that
because
he
was
subjected
to
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
that
he
cannot
be
retried.
i
think
that
he
could
be
retried
if
that
were
the
only
ground
that
we
had.
i
am
saying
that
i
think
the
procedures
carried
on
below
are
sufficiently
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
it's
our
last
argument,
your
honor.
i
hesitate
to
call
--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
would
certainly
say
that
the
state
is
going
to
try
juvenile's
criminals,
confine
them
as
criminals,
and
punish
them
as
criminals
that
it
cannot
obey
constitutional
obligations
by
--
pardon
me?
confine
them
as
criminals,
punish
them,
impose
punishment
on
them
as
criminals
that
it
can't.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
we
think
our
arguments
that
go
to
the
invalid
fact
finding
procedure
will
amply
dispose
off
this
point
and
will
show
the
invalidity
of
the
juvenile
delinquency
adjudication,
your
honor.
we're
not
relying
on
the
punishment
factor
solely
to
invalidate
the
delinquency
of
finding.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no
it
does
not
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
the
record
is
silent
on
that.
for
these
reasons,
we
pray
that
the
judgment
below
be
reversed.
thank
you
very
much.
