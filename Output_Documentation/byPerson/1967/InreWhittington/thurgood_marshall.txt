justice

where
do
we
find
the
only
order
under
which
this
boy
was
held
in
jail
between
the
time
that
he
got
back
from
the
mental
observation
period
and
the
time
he
was
indicted?
now,
where
in
the
record
or
in
the
briefs
do
we
find
the
order
under
which
he
was
held?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
it
in
there
or
resonant
in
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
you
know
it?
how
do
you
know
it
wasn't
premeditated?
justice
thurgood
marshall
will
that
prove
second
degree?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
see
anything
in
this
order
that
mentions
murder.
the
order
under
which
he
was
held
says
is
a
minor
under
the
age
of
18
years,
14
years
of
age,
and
is
a
delinquent
child,
is
set
for
the
complaint?
and
it
said
buddy
lynn
whittington
has
committed
an
act
which
would
be
a
felony
committed
by
an
adult.
that's
the
order
of
the
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
real
matter
of
fact
in
(voice
overlap)
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
i
understand
you
that
with
the
indictment
of
the
grand
jury,
if
we
reverse
this
case,
the
juvenile
court
takes
over
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
had
lost
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
we
have
before
us
is
the
holding
of
the
juvenile
judge
sending
him
to
the
school
or
wherever
it
was
to
be
examined.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
all
we
have.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
all
we
can
deal
with.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
best
i
can
gather
from
your
petition
for
certiorari
is
that
this
may
leave
me
in
some
doubt.
your
questions
presented
revolving
entirely
around
the
finding
of
the
court
that
he
was
delinquent.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
it
revolved
entirely
around
that
and
that's
the
only
thing
you
brought
up
to
us
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
you
have
a
right
to
have
a
delinquency
judgment
review
in
this
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
morehart,
is
whittington
been
release
or
has
been
out
of
custody
at
anytime
that
date
until
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
was
he
out
of
custody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
long
is
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
is
that
less
than
a

you

in
ohio.
justice
thurgood

justice
thurgood

well,
suppose
the
magistrate
binds
the
man
over
grand
jury
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that
be
a
final
order?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what's
the
different
between
that
when
the
juvenile
court
binds
him
over?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
because
he
was
trying
to
refer
it
from
court
to
the
other
that
he
is
the
exact
same
person
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
makes
it
better.
he
gets
more
rights
having
been
charged
with
crime.
justice
thurgood

how
about
a
probation
officer?
