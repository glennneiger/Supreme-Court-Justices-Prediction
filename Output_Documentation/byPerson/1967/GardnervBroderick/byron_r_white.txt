justice

white
he
never
answered
in
that
hearing
anything
about
his
--
the
conduct
of
his
official
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
should
the
state
if
it
--
all
it
was
to
do
is
to
find
out
how
the
employee
has
been
performing
his
job?
why
should
they
be
entitled
to
rely
on
a
grand
jury
proceeding
which
is
aimed
at
criminal
prosecution?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
don't'
they
just
have
an
ordinary
hearing
in
the
civil
context
and
ask
him
the
questions.
if
he
refuses
to
answer,
he
claimed
you
could
fire
if
he
answered.
you
would
know
what
you
wanted
to
know
and
what
he
said
since
it's
obtained
under
a
job
threat.
wouldn't
be
admissible
in
the
criminal
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
there
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
didn't
--
wasn't
there
a
testimony
that
he
was
a
--
what
a
--
possible
or
probable
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
defendant
in
a
criminal
prosecution?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
in
--
does
the
new
york
law
require
that
an
employee
be
asked
to
waive
immunity
if
he
is
interrogated
by
his
superior
rather
than
by
the
grand
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
he's
answered
the
questions,
he
might
been
fired
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
might
have
been.
justice
byron
r.
white
might
have
been.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
i
gather,
mr.
rankin,
if
your
position
is
that
under
that
under
the
constitution
of
new
york,
had
he
talked,
what
he
said
could
not
have
been
used
as
the
basis
for
evidence
in
a
criminal
prosecution?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
what
he
said
involved
him
in
something
for
which
he
might
be
disciplined
or
discharged.
he
then
would
have
to
be
the
subject
of
a
separate
disciplinary
proceeding,
would
he
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
in
other
words,
he'd
have
an
administrative
hearing
on
all
that
what
he
said
would
do
would
we
provide
the
basis
for
the
administrative
proceedings,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
subject
to
judicial
review,
i
gather,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think,
mr.
rankin
that
if
before
the
grand
jury
he
refused
to
waive
his
immunity
and
then
some
questions
were
put
to
him
and
he
took
the
fifth
amendment
and
said,
i
don't
need
to
answer
on
grounds
that
it'll
incriminate
me
and
the
--
and
that
--
and
the
--
he
was
taken
before
a
judge
and
refused
again
that
he
could’ve
been
held
in
contempt?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
--
do
you
think
--
do
you
--
is
it
your
position
that
garrity
in
effect
provides
an
immunity
in
those
circumstances
which
really
sends
in
place
of
the
privilege?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
you're
not
--
you
would
think
that
he
could
take
this
--
take
the
fifth
amendment
before
the
grand
jury
in
this
case
and
refuse
to
talk
and
that
only
--
and
your
only
contention
is
that
if
he
does,
he
can
be
discharged?
justice
byron
r.

he
never
answered
in

about
his
