mr.
rankin,
am
i
correct
that
this
man
was
suspended
first
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
by
the
police
commissioner.
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
charges
of
being
involved
in
gambling?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
next
day,
he
went
for
the
grand
jury.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
criminal.
one
is,
he's
got
a
chance
of
losing
his
job
permanently.
the
grand
jury
if
he
had
a
chance
to
go
into
the
penitentiary.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
while
he's
suspended
officer,
he
still
obliged
to
testify?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
you
rationalize
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you're
not
--
the
grand
jury
at
that
stage
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
fitness
as
a
police
officer.
you
have
already
started
that
machinery
by
suspending
him.
these
are
two
different
items.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
submit
that
if
he'd
been
suspended
after
you'd
had
a
different
case
from
which
you
have
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
the
only
problem
is
that
he
didn't
sign
the
waiver?
it
has
no
legal
significance?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
then
it
narrows
down
to
bad
legal
advice,
he
loses
his
job.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
that
what
it
is.
he's
operating
on
the
advice
of
counsel.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
say
counsel
was
wrong.
