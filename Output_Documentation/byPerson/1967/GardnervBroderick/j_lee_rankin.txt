mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
that
is
of
great
importance
to
all
municipal
governments,
state
governments
and
federal
governments,
federal
government
in
this
country.
the
problem
is
whether
or
not
a
person
occupying
official
position,
one
of
the
most
important
of
which
is
a
policeman
in
any
city.
law
enforcing
officer
can
be
asked
in
regard
to
the
performance
of
his
duties.
mr.
justice
black
--
stewart
brought
out
properly
the
issue
in
this
case
which
did
not
involve
the
questioning
in
regard
to
the
performance
of
those
duties
because
the
appellant
refused
to
sign
any
waiver.
but
he
gave
as
his
reason
even
more
than
that
in
that
he
said
that,
“under
the
law,
it
was
not
legal
for
him
to
be
subpoenaed
before
a
grand
jury
where
he
was
a
target
of
the
investigation”.
so
that
he
made
it
plain
that
he
would
not
answer
any
questions
regardless
because
he
said,
"he
could
not
legally
be
brought
before
the
jury".
now,
he
was
in
error
in
regard
to
the
law
in
so
asserting
although
he
did
it
under
the
advice
of
counsel.
the
law
as
set
out
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
in
tomasello,
and
goldman,
also
in
stude
make
it
plain
that
there
is
a
right
and
legal
power
to
subpoena
him
before
the
grand
jury.
but
there
are
certain
instance
under
the
constitution
of
new
york
that
result
from
that
if
he
testifies.
and
if
he
proceeds
to
testify,
he
gets
protection
regarding
that
testimony.
that
is
automatically
giving
him
whether
he
claims
the
privilege
or
not
in
regard
to
any
testimony
that
he
gives.
and
that
protection
concerning
that
testimony
is
less
than
the
protection
or
the
immunity
he
would
get
under
section
2447
of
the
penal
code.
in
that,
it
protects
him
concerning
the
use
of
that
testimony
and
any
of
its
fruits
but
not
--
does
not
extend
to
the
coverage
of
matter,
thing
or
transaction
involved
in
2447.
or
is
the
same
kind
of
protection
that
the
court
described
and
provided
in
murphy
against
waterfront.
this
case,
we
think
is
controlled
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
nelson,
beilan
and
lerner
against
casey.
except
that
since
those
cases,
this
court
has
moved
on
and
included
murphy
against
waterfront
and
garrity
so
that
a
person
called
before
the
grand
jury
has
protections
that
were
not
present
in
any
of
the
three
cases
that
i've
named.
beyond
that,
this
inquiry
by
definition
in
the
constitution
and
also
in
the
charter
provision
is
a
limited
inquiry.
it
does
not
relate
to
security
risk
and
loyalty
and
other
elements
that
are
involved
in
those
cases
but
to
--
is
in
precisely
the
question
of
the
performance
by
the
party
involved
of
his
official
duties
in
that
job.
now,
this
case
dramatically
presents
that
problem.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
think
that's
involved
here
at
all.
these
provisions
are
explicit
in
regard
to
official
duties
and
performance.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
wouldn't
think
it
was
possible
under
these
provisions.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
this
is
a
very
limited
inquiry
and
it's
a
question
of
whether
a
policeman
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
if
you
take
all
public
officials
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
has
extended
it
perlas
to
public
officials.
that's
a
class
and
as
a
reasonable
classification
and
this
constitutional
provision
and
the
charter
provision
were
in
response
to
the
reaction
of
the
people
in
the
state
of
new
york
in
connection
with
the
see
berry
investigations,
to
the
idea
that
people
who
admittedly
had
done
all
kinds
of
criminal
acts
showed
in
those
investigations
could
continue
to
occupy
their
public
positions
because
there
is
nothing
the
people
could
do
about
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
the
case
of
dismissal
just
for
a
refusal
to
sign
a
waiver
is
the
most
difficult
case
because
the
heart,
the
essence
of
this
right,
the
people
of
new
york
wish
to
assert
is
to
find
out
how
this
man
was
conducting
his
work
on
behalf
of
the
people.
now,
this
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
a
contention
of
the
city
in
this
case
that
he
does
have
that
immunity
by
reason
of
garrity.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
has
no
effect
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
because
there
you
are
going
getting
to
the
question
of
the
particular
conduct.
on
the
other
hand
that
if
he
will
not
--
if
he
just
refuse
to
answer
which
is
the
effect,
a
refusal
to
sign
a
waiver,
certainly,
when
he
has
--
gets
the
immunity,
it
does
under
murphy
and
garrity.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
we
have
a
further
gloss
on
this
case
and
that
he
refused
to
answer
or
sign
the
waiver
and
to
answer
on
the
ground
that
he
could
not
even
be
subpoenaed
before
the
grand
jury.
so
it
would
be
a
futile
act
for
us
to
try
to
follow
up
and
compel
him
to
answer
under
the
decisions
of
the
court
because
he
took
the
position
that
he
couldn't
be
sworn
and
he
couldn't
be
compelled
to
answer.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
it
treated
that
as
insubordination
and
the
failure
to
--
it
did
treat
it
as
a
failure
to
respond
and
tell
how
he
had
discharged
his
duties.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
court
went
beyond
that
in
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
treated
it
as
a
refusal
to
answer
the
questions.
now,
there
is
no
slochower
point
in
the
case
as
we
visualize
it
because
of
the
hearing
in
which
he
was
given
opportunity
to
explain
his
reasons
for
refusing
to
waive
and
answer
questions.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
we
did
not.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
grand
jury
in
new
york
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
a
grand
jury
inquiry
is
a
broader
inquiry
under
the
law
of
new
york,
then
just
a
proceeding
which
needs
to
end
in
indictment.
i
know
one,
a
misunderstanding
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
in
this
case,
he
was
a
target
of
the
investigation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
he
was
a
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
but
the
grand
jury
in
new
york
has
a
power
to
make
presentments
which
involved
the
recommendations
about
the
conduct
of
the
laws,
enforcement,
and
other
matters
of
that
kind.
so
if
they
have
this
broader
right,
broader
interest,
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
grand
jury
should
properly
be
able
to
inquire
into
the
manner
in
which
public
officials
are
performing
their
duty.
and
then
they
correct
commendations
to
the
legislature
or
the
governor,
other
officials
as
to
how
these
laws
should
be
changed
or
improved
to
carry
out
the
purposes
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
it
--
the
constitution
does
not,
the
charter
does.
there
is
that
distinction
between
the
two.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
i
say
that
in
light
of
garrity,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
may
i
hear
the
question
again,
your
honor?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
you
told
him
that
the
waiver
had
no
effect
as
far
as
waiving
his
rights
were
concerned
and
that
he
had
all
of
the
rights
that
he
has
under
garrity
and
murphy
against
waterfront
that
he
would
have
no
excuse
for
not
proceeding
to
testify.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
he
was
not.
but
in
the
book
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
but
then
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
grand
jury
has
a
legitimate
right
of
inquiry
in
regard
to
the
performance
of
his
duties
in
law
enforcement
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
fact
that
it
makes
an
inquiry.
if
it's
the
target
--
if
he's
the
target
of
the
investigation,
he
gets
the
protection
of
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
new
york
anyway
as
to
the
use
of
that
testimony
and
the
fruits
of
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
further
problem
that
he
asserted
that
he
could
not
be
compelled
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
at
all
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
because
he
was
the
target.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
he
refuses
to
answer
the
question
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
you
can
assume
that
he
had
good
grounds
for
thinking
that
he
might
be
incriminated
and
those
grounds
included
he
himself
being
involved
in
some
way
as
his
reasons,
then
if
they'd
--
if
it
disclose
that
he
was
involved
in
a
bribery,
he
certainly
would
have
been
discharged
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
the
law
in
new
york,
yes
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
there
is
a
contention
here,
however,
that
he
cannot
be
--
even
though
he
is
given
all
of
those
protections
under
garrity
and
murphy
and
so
forth,
and
also
those
under
stude
under
new
york
law
nevertheless,
he
could
not
be
asked
about
the
performance
of
his
duties
in
connection
with
any
disciplinary
hearing.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
don't
think
so
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
court
at
least
--
court
of
appeals
has
not
yet
decided
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i've
been
told
by
your
decisions
you
haven't
cited
that
question
yet
to
counsel
--
regard
to
counselman.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
have
difficulty
with
answering
that
categorically
in
light
of
your
decision
in
murphy
against
waterfront
and
in
garrity
and
trying
to
arrive
at
the
question
of
whether
or
not
how
much
immunity
you
did
give
in
those
cases
which
clearly
say
that
there
is
--
that
the
testimony
could
not
be
used
and
the
fruits
cannot
be
used
but
does
not
go
as
far
as
counselman's
dictum.
that
i
think
is
the
issue
of
the
question
that
you're
asking.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
before
the
grand
jury,
no
it
did
not
involve
his
shooting.
it
involved
the
question
of
the
bribery
of
police
officials
regarding
--
to
keep
them
from
interfering
with
gambling
activities
in
the
city.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
was
an
investigation
of
bribery
transactions
that
were
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
this
particular
appellant
was
thought
to
be
one
of
those
involved
in
the
bribery
at
the
time
of
the
investigation
for
the
grand
jury.
and
when
he
was
given
the
hearing
and
took
the
position
that
he
would
not
sign
the
waiver
and
the
reason
--
and
that
he
would
not
--
could
not
be
required
to
testify
before
the
grand
jury
because
he
could
not
be
called
and
sworn
before
the
jury.
there
was
no
purpose
in
trying
to
do
anything
more
about
asking
about
what
he'd
done
because
he
was
indicating
that
he
was
taking
illegal
position
but
he
didn't
--
could
not
be
compelled
to
testify
from
that
point
on.
the
importance
of
this
issue
is
obvious
and
i'm
sure
that
the
court
has
recognized
in
connection
with
the
footnote
that
was
referred
to
and
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
fortas
and
the
very
structure
of
our
government
and
it’s
various
parts
in
the
federal
system
and
the
right
to
try
to
find
out
what
any
official
has
been
doing
and
his
doing
in
the
performance
of
his
duties.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
know
of
anything
of
that
kind,
mr.
justice.
i
offhand
had
thought
that
that
would
not
add
anything
because
he
would
be
presumed
to
know
what
the
constitution
provides
and
what
the
charter
provided.
and
if
that
would
make
a
part
of
his
contractual
relationship
with
the
community
that
once
he
took
upon
himself
the
job
of
enforcing
the
laws
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
that
is
of
great
importance
to
all
municipal
governments,
state
governments
and
federal
governments,
federal
government
in
this
country.
the
problem
is
whether
or
not
a
person
occupying
official
position,
one
of
the
most
important
of
which
is
a
policeman
in
any
city.
law
enforcing
officer
can
be
asked
in
regard
to
the
performance
of
his
duties.
mr.
justice
black
--
stewart
brought
out
properly
the
issue
in
this
case
which
did
not
involve
the
questioning
in
regard
to
the
performance
of
those
duties
because
the
appellant
refused
to
sign
any
waiver.
but
he
gave
as
his
reason
even
more
than
that
in
that
he
said
that,
“under
the
law,
it
was
not
legal
for
him
to
be
subpoenaed
before
a
grand
jury
where
he
was
a
target
of
the
investigation”.
so
that
he
made
it
plain
that
he
would
not
answer
any
questions
regardless
because
he
said,
"he
could
not
legally
be
brought
before
the
jury".
now,
he
was
in
error
in
regard
to
the
law
in
so
asserting
although
he
did
it
under
the
advice
of
counsel.
the
law
as
set
out
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
in
tomasello,
and
goldman,
also
in
stude
make
it
plain
that
there
is
a
right
and
legal
power
to
subpoena
him
before
the
grand
jury.
but
there
are
certain
instance
under
the
constitution
of
new
york
that
result
from
that
if
he
testifies.
and
if
he
proceeds
to
testify,
he
gets
protection
regarding
that
testimony.
that
is
automatically
giving
him
whether
he
claims
the
privilege
or
not
in
regard
to
any
testimony
that
he
gives.
and
that
protection
concerning
that
testimony
is
less
than
the
protection
or
the
immunity
he
would
get
under
section
2447
of
the
penal
code.
in
that,
it
protects
him
concerning
the
use
of
that
testimony
and
any
of
its
fruits
but
not
--
does
not
extend
to
the
coverage
of
matter,
thing
or
transaction
involved
in
2447.
or
is
the
same
kind
of
protection
that
the
court
described
and
provided
in
murphy
against
waterfront.
this
case,
we
think
is
controlled
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
nelson,
beilan
and
lerner
against
casey.
except
that
since
those
cases,
this
court
has
moved
on
and
included
murphy
against
waterfront
and
garrity
so
that
a
person
called
before
the
grand
jury
has
protections
that
were
not
present
in
any
of
the
three
cases
that
i've
named.
beyond
that,
this
inquiry
by
definition
in
the
constitution
and
also
in
the
charter
provision
is
a
limited
inquiry.
it
does
not
relate
to
security
risk
and
loyalty
and
other
elements
that
are
involved
in
those
cases
but
to
--
is
in
precisely
the
question
of
the
performance
by
the
party
involved
of
his
official
duties
in
that
job.
now,
this
case
dramatically
presents
that
problem.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
think
that's
involved
here
at
all.
these
provisions
are
explicit
in
regard
to
official
duties
and
performance.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
wouldn't
think
it
was
possible
under
these
provisions.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
this
is
a
very
limited
inquiry
and
it's
a
question
of
whether
a
policeman
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
if
you
take
all
public
officials
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
has
extended
it
perlas
to
public
officials.
that's
a
class
and
as
a
reasonable
classification
and
this
constitutional
provision
and
the
charter
provision
were
in
response
to
the
reaction
of
the
people
in
the
state
of
new
york
in
connection
with
the
see
berry
investigations,
to
the
idea
that
people
who
admittedly
had
done
all
kinds
of
criminal
acts
showed
in
those
investigations
could
continue
to
occupy
their
public
positions
because
there
is
nothing
the
people
could
do
about
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
the
case
of
dismissal
just
for
a
refusal
to
sign
a
waiver
is
the
most
difficult
case
because
the
heart,
the
essence
of
this
right,
the
people
of
new
york
wish
to
assert
is
to
find
out
how
this
man
was
conducting
his
work
on
behalf
of
the
people.
now,
this
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
a
contention
of
the
city
in
this
case
that
he
does
have
that
immunity
by
reason
of
garrity.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
has
no
effect
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
because
there
you
are
going
getting
to
the
question
of
the
particular
conduct.
on
the
other
hand
that
if
he
will
not
--
if
he
just
refuse
to
answer
which
is
the
effect,
a
refusal
to
sign
a
waiver,
certainly,
when
he
has
--
gets
the
immunity,
it
does
under
murphy
and
garrity.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
but
we
have
a
further
gloss
on
this
case
and
that
he
refused
to
answer
or
sign
the
waiver
and
to
answer
on
the
ground
that
he
could
not
even
be
subpoenaed
before
the
grand
jury.
so
it
would
be
a
futile
act
for
us
to
try
to
follow
up
and
compel
him
to
answer
under
the
decisions
of
the
court
because
he
took
the
position
that
he
couldn't
be
sworn
and
he
couldn't
be
compelled
to
answer.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
it
treated
that
as
insubordination
and
the
failure
to
--
it
did
treat
it
as
a
failure
to
respond
and
tell
how
he
had
discharged
his
duties.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
court
went
beyond
that
in
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
treated
it
as
a
refusal
to
answer
the
questions.
now,
there
is
no
slochower
point
in
the
case
as
we
visualize
it
because
of
the
hearing
in
which
he
was
given
opportunity
to
explain
his
reasons
for
refusing
to
waive
and
answer
questions.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
we
did
not.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
grand
jury
in
new
york
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
a
grand
jury
inquiry
is
a
broader
inquiry
under
the
law
of
new
york,
then
just
a
proceeding
which
needs
to
end
in
indictment.
i
know
one,
a
misunderstanding
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
in
this
case,
he
was
a
target
of
the
investigation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
he
was
a
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
but
the
grand
jury
in
new
york
has
a
power
to
make
presentments
which
involved
the
recommendations
about
the
conduct
of
the
laws,
enforcement,
and
other
matters
of
that
kind.
so
if
they
have
this
broader
right,
broader
interest,
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
grand
jury
should
properly
be
able
to
inquire
into
the
manner
in
which
public
officials
are
performing
their
duty.
and
then
they
correct
commendations
to
the
legislature
or
the
governor,
other
officials
as
to
how
these
laws
should
be
changed
or
improved
to
carry
out
the
purposes
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
it
--
the
constitution
does
not,
the
charter
does.
there
is
that
distinction
between
the
two.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
i
say
that
in
light
of
garrity,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
may
i
hear
the
question
again,
your
honor?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
you
told
him
that
the
waiver
had
no
effect
as
far
as
waiving
his
rights
were
concerned
and
that
he
had
all
of
the
rights
that
he
has
under
garrity
and
murphy
against
waterfront
that
he
would
have
no
excuse
for
not
proceeding
to
testify.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
he
was
not.
but
in
the
book
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
but
then
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
grand
jury
has
a
legitimate
right
of
inquiry
in
regard
to
the
performance
of
his
duties
in
law
enforcement
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
fact
that
it
makes
an
inquiry.
if
it's
the
target
--
if
he's
the
target
of
the
investigation,
he
gets
the
protection
of
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
new
york
anyway
as
to
the
use
of
that
testimony
and
the
fruits
of
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
further
problem
that
he
asserted
that
he
could
not
be
compelled
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
at
all
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
because
he
was
the
target.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
he
refuses
to
answer
the
question
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
if
you
can
assume
that
he
had
good
grounds
for
thinking
that
he
might
be
incriminated
and
those
grounds
included
he
himself
being
involved
in
some
way
as
his
reasons,
then
if
they'd
--
if
it
disclose
that
he
was
involved
in
a
bribery,
he
certainly
would
have
been
discharged
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
the
law
in
new
york,
yes
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
there
is
a
contention
here,
however,
that
he
cannot
be
--
even
though
he
is
given
all
of
those
protections
under
garrity
and
murphy
and
so
forth,
and
also
those
under
stude
under
new
york
law
nevertheless,
he
could
not
be
asked
about
the
performance
of
his
duties
in
connection
with
any
disciplinary
hearing.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
don't
think
so
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
court
at
least
--
court
of
appeals
has
not
yet
decided
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i've
been
told
by
your
decisions
you
haven't
cited
that
question
yet
to
counsel
--
regard
to
counselman.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
have
difficulty
with
answering
that
categorically
in
light
of
your
decision
in
murphy
against
waterfront
and
in
garrity
and
trying
to
arrive
at
the
question
of
whether
or
not
how
much
immunity
you
did
give
in
those
cases
which
clearly
say
that
there
is
--
that
the
testimony
could
not
be
used
and
the
fruits
cannot
be
used
but
does
not
go
as
far
as
counselman's
dictum.
that
i
think
is
the
issue
of
the
question
that
you're
asking.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
before
the
grand
jury,
no
it
did
not
involve
his
shooting.
it
involved
the
question
of
the
bribery
of
police
officials
regarding
--
to
keep
them
from
interfering
with
gambling
activities
in
the
city.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
was
an
investigation
of
bribery
transactions
that
were
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
this
particular
appellant
was
thought
to
be
one
of
those
involved
in
the
bribery
at
the
time
of
the
investigation
for
the
grand
jury.
and
when
he
was
given
the
hearing
and
took
the
position
that
he
would
not
sign
the
waiver
and
the
reason
--
and
that
he
would
not
--
could
not
be
required
to
testify
before
the
grand
jury
because
he
could
not
be
called
and
sworn
before
the
jury.
there
was
no
purpose
in
trying
to
do
anything
more
about
asking
about
what
he'd
done
because
he
was
indicating
that
he
was
taking
illegal
position
but
he
didn't
--
could
not
be
compelled
to
testify
from
that
point
on.
the
importance
of
this
issue
is
obvious
and
i'm
sure
that
the
court
has
recognized
in
connection
with
the
footnote
that
was
referred
to
and
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
fortas
and
the
very
structure
of
our
government
and
it’s
various
parts
in
the
federal
system
and
the
right
to
try
to
find
out
what
any
official
has
been
doing
and
his
doing
in
the
performance
of
his
duties.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
know
of
anything
of
that
kind,
mr.
justice.
i
offhand
had
thought
that
that
would
not
add
anything
because
he
would
be
presumed
to
know
what
the
constitution
provides
and
what
the
charter
provided.
and
if
that
would
make
a
part
of
his
contractual
relationship
with
the
community
that
once
he
took
upon
himself
the
job
of
enforcing
the
laws
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
