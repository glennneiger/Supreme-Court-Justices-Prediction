mr.
ronald
podolsky
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
court.
in
this
case
probable
jurisdiction
has
already
been
noted.
it's
a
--
an
appeal
by
a
former
policeman
who
was
dismissed
by
the
appellees.
this
policeman
was
served
with
departmental
charges
involving
conspiracy
to
violate
gambling
laws
--
the
next
--
and
suspended.
the
next
day,
he
was
subpoenaed
before
the
grand
jury
of
new
york
county
and
asked
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
from
prosecution.
it
was
announced
at
that
hearing
that
it
was
a
criminal
investigation
into
conspiracy
to
violate
gambling
laws.
the
appellant
refused
to
sign
such
a
waiver
on
advice
of
counsel
stating
that
since
he
was
a
target
of
the
investigation,
the
grand
jury
had
no
authority
to
subpoena
and
question
him.
he
was
not
questioned.
he
was
not
granted
immunity
but
rather
excused
and
thereupon
was
served
with
an
additional
departmental
charge,
refusal
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
before
the
grand
jury
as
required
by
article
i,
section
6
of
the
new
york
state
constitution
and
section
1123
of
the
new
york
city
charter.
and
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
it
is
my
position,
your
honor.
the
appellant's
position
that
since
he
was
under
subpoena.
any
testimony
that
he
gave
at
that
hearing
would
cause
immunity
to
attach
to
the
substantive
area
of
the
inquiry.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
as
a
matter
of
new
york
and
i
believe
federal
law
as
well.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
yes,
sir.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
under
these
circumstances
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
yes.
there
is
a
more
formal
procedure
under
244
--
2447
at
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
which
was
not
followed
in
this
case.
but
it
is
my
position
that
he
would
have
been
granted
immunity
had
he
testified
under
the
compelled
compulsion
of
the
subpoena.
yes,
your
honor.
now
the
appellant
was
served
with
an
additional
charge,
refusal
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
by
the
police
commissioner
and
directed
to
report
for
a
hearing
on
that
charge.
upon
appearing,
the
appellant
requested
that
all
three
charges;
the
substantive
charges
as
well
as
the
procedural
charge
of
refusal
to
sign
a
waiver
be
tried
at
once.
this
request
was
denied
and
the
hearing
proceeded
under
objection
on
the
one
charge
of
refusal
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity.
and
the
grand
jury
minutes
and
the
district
attorney
testified
at
that
hearing
and
resulted
in
the
dismissal
complained
of
in
this
action.
no
disposition
of
the
substantive
charges
of
misconduct
was
made.
it
is
the
appellant's
contention
that
the
requirement
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
before
the
grand
jury
imposed
by
state
law
is
an
unconstitutional
limitation
on
the
federal
constitutional
provisions
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
therefore
must
fall
under
the
federal
supremacy
of
laws
section.
i
think
it's
very
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
he
was
under
substantive
charges
involving
the
same
area
of
grand
jury
inquiry
at
the
time
he
was
asked
to
sign
a
waiver.
he
was
not
someone
against
to
whom
charges
were
not
then
and
there
pending.
appeals
through
the
courts
to
this
court
subsequently
followed.
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
said
that
the
garrity
case
undoubtedly
partially
invalidated
these
sections,
these
sections
of
law
requiring
the
waiver.
may
i
inquire
whether
we
break
for
lunch
now,
your
honor?
mr.
ronald
podolsky
thank
you.
a
portion
of
the
subpoena
would
be
inadmissible
but
absolute
immunity
i
don't
think
would
apply
unless
the
formal
procedures
under
the
new
york
penal
law
were
followed.
and
there
was
a
definite
intention
on
the
part
of
the
grand
jury
to
confer
that
immunity.
there
was
no
legal
residuum
here
respecting
the
substantive
acts
of
misconduct.
no
finding
whatever.
the
only
act
of
misconduct
here
was
an
invocation
of
a
federally
protected
right
against
self-incrimination.
under
malloy
against
hogan,
the
protection
of
fourteenth
amendment
is
coextensive
with
that
of
the
fifth
and
it
applies
to
the
states.
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
in
new
york
in
this
case
has
held
that
a
refusal
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
is
equivalent
to
and
an
act
of
invoking
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
and
that
being
the
highest
court
in
the
state,
i
think
that
their
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
binding
for
all
purposes
in
this
case.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
state
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
he
was
never
asked
any
questions.
he
was
excused
upon
his
refusal
to
sign
a
waiver,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
in
new
york
by
mr.--
by
judge
fuld,
chief
judge
fuld,
has
said
in
its
opinion
in
this
particular
case,
“definitely
that
a
refusal
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
under
this
circumstance
is
in
fact
an
invocation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
in
the
opinion
itself”.
and
therefore,
taking
this
interpretation
as
being
binding
by
the
highest
court
in
the
state
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
it
says
construction
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
your
honor
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
your
honor,
it
was
a
construction
of
a
new
york
state
constitutional
provision.
article
i,
section
6
required
the
appellant
according
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
waive
his
immunity
--
waive
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
testify.
that
is
directly
from
the
opinion
in
this
case.
now
the
new
york
state
constitutional
proviso,
accepting
public
officers
from
its
own
protection
contained
against
self-incrimination
under
article
i,
section
6
at
the
same
time
seeks
to
add
a
proviso
to
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
a
proviso
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
when
no
such
proviso
exists
in
the
federal
constitution.
therefore,
it
is
the
appellant's
position
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
that
the
requirements
are
unconstitutional
for
continued
public
office.
now,
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
have
applied
not
only
to
criminal
sanctions
but
also
to
administrative
sanctions
citing
for
example
(inaudible)
case,
lovett,
and
a
few
other
cases
in
my
brief
so
that
we
have
a
situation
where
there
is
a
penalty
visited
upon
this
appellant
strictly
by
virtue
of
his
invocation
of
a
federally
protected
right.
the
right
--
the
invocation
of
that
right
has
proved
costly
and
it
is
a
federally
protected
right.
the
action
of
the
state
in
new
york
in
requiring
its
public
officers
to
waive
a
federally
protective
requirement
is
not,
i
believe,
a
constitutional
one.
now
this
--
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
has
said
that
garrity
undoubtedly
partially
invalidated
article
i,
section
6
of
the
new
york
state
constitution
but
they
don't
say
what
part
of
that
is
invalid
nor
is
there
any
saving
clause
that
i
could
find
in
the
new
york
state
constitution
saying
that
a
part
of
a
section
is
declared
unconstitutional.
the
rest
survives.
at
any
rate,
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
that
the
question
when
gardner
was
before
the
grand
jury
and
all
the
way
up
to
the
time
of
the
court
of
appeals
decided
its
case
and
including
today,
they
have
said
that
this
is
an
open
question
that
this
court
has
left
the
question
open.
yet,
they
have
countenance
by
their
affirmation.
the
full
penalty
against
this
appellant
for
a
cause
of
action
which
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
very
openness
of
the
question
so
we
feel
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
there
is
no
doubt
in
that
in
respect.
however,
it
also
inquired
into
an
area
under
which
he
was
charged
by
the
department
existing
charges
which
to
this
day
have
never
been
disposed
off.
so
that
it
is
--
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
in
new
york
has
said
that
the
appellant
herein
committed
an
act
of
misconduct.
yet,
they
recognized
that
the
very
question
is
an
open
one.
is
the
appellant
held
to
a
higher
degree
of
knowledge
of
the
law
than
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
here
or
his
actions
or
were
his
actions
perfectly
consistent
with
the
very
openness
of
the
question,
which
we
hoped
to
close
today.
the
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
yes,
your
honor.
the
sole
question
at
that
hearing
was
did
he
or
did
he
not
refuse
to
sign
a
waiver?
there
was
a
motion
at
that
hearing
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
there
was
no
automatic
dismissal.
we
have
a
(inaudible)
point
in
that
that
the
mere
invocation
of
the
constitutional
privilege
is
not
an
act
of
misconduct
as
far
as
we're
--
as
far
as
the
appellant
is
concern.
we
have
a
situation
also
where
to
apply
this
statute
as
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
has
applied
it.
we
would
have
a
shift
of
burden
of
proof
of
misconduct
when
the
precepts
of
due
process
of
law
and
the
statutes
involved
in
the
state
of
new
york
placed
that
burden
upon
the
prosecution.
the
prosecuting
authority
of
the
state
in
new
york
by
an
extrinsic
independent
evidence
must
come
up
--
prove
acts
of
misconduct,
substantive
acts
of
misconduct.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
yes,
your
honor.
if
it
appears
that
there
was
a
disciplinary
reason
for
asking
it
rather
than
a
supervisory
one.
for
example,
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
yes.
if
it
appears
that
his
answers
will
tend
to
incriminate
him,
either
disciplinary
action
for
example.
i
feel
that
he
would
have
a
right
to
maintain
silence.
if
it
is
used
to
investigate
for
supervisory
reasons,
for
example
strengthening
patrols
in
the
certain
area
or
even
suspending
him
pending
investigation
of
extrinsic
evidence,
then
for
that
limited
purpose,
i
would
say
that
he
could
answer
it.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
if
it
is
limited
strictly
to
supervisory
will
not
be
used
against
him
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
--
in
a
disciplinary
sense,
then
i
would
say
that
his
refusal
to
answer,
in
addition
to
the
extrinsic
evidence
of
the
fact
of
the
killing
and
the
gunshot
and
the
ballistics
test,
it
would
be
illegal
residuum
there
to
support
a
dismissal
if
the
request
were
for
a
supervisory
rather
than
a
disciplinary
reason.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
you
have,
you
have.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
my
answer
is
that
if
--
if
the
--
it
goes
back
again,
your
honor
to
the
purpose
of
the
questioning.
if
he
is
assured,
if
he's
granted
in
effect
immunity
from
prosecution,
administrative
or
otherwise,
then
that's
another
ins
--
another
situation
as
not
being
used
against
him.
it's
being
used
either
to
strengthen
patrols
or
get
him
off
a
sensitive
post
or
whatever
it
is.
but
if
it's
going
to
be
used
against
him
in
a
disciplinary
sense,
then
the
state
would
just
have
to
unfortunately
content
itself
with
gathering
extrinsic
evidence
independently
gathered
to
discharge
this
officer.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
especially
--
yes,
especially,
if
he's
under
departmental
charges,
which
he
was
in
this
case
and
if
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
i
don't
think
his
answers
there
can
be
used
against
him,
your
honor.
there
can
be
--
they
--
at
that
point,
he
is
the
focus
of
an
investigation
and
once
that
comes,
we
have
constitutional
--
the
questions
arising,
a
constitutional
objections
to
his
response.
if
he
is
being
accused,
he
has
a
right
to
be
confronted
by
his
accusers
and
cross-examine
him
before
he
has
a
duty
particularly
to
go
ahead
with
the
evidence
to
counter
it.
so
state
must
have
a
extrinsic
evidence
which
would
result
in
a
legal
residuum.
under
those
instances
if
they
have
enough
to
dismiss
him,
his
silence
would
advance
no
tenable
reason
in
mitigation,
extenuation
or
explanation
for
his
continued
service
but
his
silence
again
cannot
be
used
as
a
confession
of
guilt
under
any
circumstances.
we
have
a
situation
where
the
state
is
attempting
to
add
a
state
proviso
to
a
federal
constitutional
provision.
under
malloy
against
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
your
honor,
the
refusal
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
under
this
section
mandates
dismissal.
it's
not
discretionary.
they
say,
"well,
we'll
give
him
a
hearing".
what's
the
hearing
have
to
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
well,
in
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
the
legislative
determination
at
that
instance
runs
contrary
to
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
therefore
must
fall
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
yes,
your
honor.
well,
that
is
the
position
that
the
appellant
takes
in
this
case.
there
are
no
--
now
the
reservations
in
spevack
against
klein,
footnote
3
and
also
mr.
justice
fortas'
reservation
in
that
case,
spoke
about
a
silence
at
a
disciplinary
hearing.
the
appellant's
silence
in
this
instance
was
not
at
the
disciplinary
hearing.
it
was
a
grand
jury
hearing
without
disciplinary
powers
with
powers
to
indict.
it
was
a
criminal
investigation
so
i
think
that
the
reservations
there
--
i
don't
agree
with
them
but
i
don't
think
they
apply
in
this
case.
i
think
that
the
reservations
are
not
appropriate
either
because
there
would
be
a
violation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
which
applies
to
states
here.
again,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
there's
no
--
at
this
hearing
that
they
give,
the
hearing.
the
dismissal
is
mandatory.
the
hearing,
in
my
opinion
in
this
case
where
he
gave
adequate
and
good
reason
for
his
failure
to
answer
questions
and
that
being
that
he
was
a
target
of
the
investigation
and
was
illegally
subpoenaed.
now
it
was
a
reason,
the
reason
was
before
the
commissioner
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
he
had
an
adequate
and
good
reason,
explanation
at
this
hearing.
you
see
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
he
had
an
adequate
and
good
reason
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
he
was
an
--
he
had
an
adequate
and
good
reason
for
objecting
to
his
very
presence
in
the
grand
jury
room
that
a
subpoena
was
illegal
on
the
ground
that
he
was
a
target
of
the
investigation
and
under
bernoff
against
amoroso
cited
in
my
brief,
this
subpoena
probably
was
illegal
and
--
thank
you.
thank
you.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
your
honor
the
appellant
waives
rebuttal.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
court.
in
this
case
probable
jurisdiction
has
already
been
noted.
it's
a
--
an
appeal
by
a
former
policeman
who
was
dismissed
by
the
appellees.
this
policeman
was
served
with
departmental
charges
involving
conspiracy
to
violate
gambling
laws
--
the
next
--
and
suspended.
the
next
day,
he
was
subpoenaed
before
the
grand
jury
of
new
york
county
and
asked
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
from
prosecution.
it
was
announced
at
that
hearing
that
it
was
a
criminal
investigation
into
conspiracy
to
violate
gambling
laws.
the
appellant
refused
to
sign
such
a
waiver
on
advice
of
counsel
stating
that
since
he
was
a
target
of
the
investigation,
the
grand
jury
had
no
authority
to
subpoena
and
question
him.
he
was
not
questioned.
he
was
not
granted
immunity
but
rather
excused
and
thereupon
was
served
with
an
additional
departmental
charge,
refusal
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
before
the
grand
jury
as
required
by
article
i,
section
6
of
the
new
york
state
constitution
and
section
1123
of
the
new
york
city
charter.
and
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
it
is
my
position,
your
honor.
the
appellant's
position
that
since
he
was
under
subpoena.
any
testimony
that
he
gave
at
that
hearing
would
cause
immunity
to
attach
to
the
substantive
area
of
the
inquiry.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
as
a
matter
of
new
york
and
i
believe
federal
law
as
well.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
yes,
sir.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
under
these
circumstances
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
yes.
there
is
a
more
formal
procedure
under
244
--
2447
at
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
which
was
not
followed
in
this
case.
but
it
is
my
position
that
he
would
have
been
granted
immunity
had
he
testified
under
the
compelled
compulsion
of
the
subpoena.
yes,
your
honor.
now
the
appellant
was
served
with
an
additional
charge,
refusal
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
by
the
police
commissioner
and
directed
to
report
for
a
hearing
on
that
charge.
upon
appearing,
the
appellant
requested
that
all
three
charges;
the
substantive
charges
as
well
as
the
procedural
charge
of
refusal
to
sign
a
waiver
be
tried
at
once.
this
request
was
denied
and
the
hearing
proceeded
under
objection
on
the
one
charge
of
refusal
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity.
and
the
grand
jury
minutes
and
the
district
attorney
testified
at
that
hearing
and
resulted
in
the
dismissal
complained
of
in
this
action.
no
disposition
of
the
substantive
charges
of
misconduct
was
made.
it
is
the
appellant's
contention
that
the
requirement
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
before
the
grand
jury
imposed
by
state
law
is
an
unconstitutional
limitation
on
the
federal
constitutional
provisions
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
therefore
must
fall
under
the
federal
supremacy
of
laws
section.
i
think
it's
very
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
he
was
under
substantive
charges
involving
the
same
area
of
grand
jury
inquiry
at
the
time
he
was
asked
to
sign
a
waiver.
he
was
not
someone
against
to
whom
charges
were
not
then
and
there
pending.
appeals
through
the
courts
to
this
court
subsequently
followed.
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
said
that
the
garrity
case
undoubtedly
partially
invalidated
these
sections,
these
sections
of
law
requiring
the
waiver.
may
i
inquire
whether
we
break
for
lunch
now,
your
honor?
mr.
ronald
podolsky
thank
you.
a
portion
of
the
subpoena
would
be
inadmissible
but
absolute
immunity
i
don't
think
would
apply
unless
the
formal
procedures
under
the
new
york
penal
law
were
followed.
and
there
was
a
definite
intention
on
the
part
of
the
grand
jury
to
confer
that
immunity.
there
was
no
legal
residuum
here
respecting
the
substantive
acts
of
misconduct.
no
finding
whatever.
the
only
act
of
misconduct
here
was
an
invocation
of
a
federally
protected
right
against
self-incrimination.
under
malloy
against
hogan,
the
protection
of
fourteenth
amendment
is
coextensive
with
that
of
the
fifth
and
it
applies
to
the
states.
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
in
new
york
in
this
case
has
held
that
a
refusal
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
is
equivalent
to
and
an
act
of
invoking
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
and
that
being
the
highest
court
in
the
state,
i
think
that
their
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
binding
for
all
purposes
in
this
case.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
state
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
he
was
never
asked
any
questions.
he
was
excused
upon
his
refusal
to
sign
a
waiver,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
in
new
york
by
mr.--
by
judge
fuld,
chief
judge
fuld,
has
said
in
its
opinion
in
this
particular
case,
“definitely
that
a
refusal
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
under
this
circumstance
is
in
fact
an
invocation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
in
the
opinion
itself”.
and
therefore,
taking
this
interpretation
as
being
binding
by
the
highest
court
in
the
state
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
it
says
construction
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
your
honor
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
your
honor,
it
was
a
construction
of
a
new
york
state
constitutional
provision.
article
i,
section
6
required
the
appellant
according
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
waive
his
immunity
--
waive
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
testify.
that
is
directly
from
the
opinion
in
this
case.
now
the
new
york
state
constitutional
proviso,
accepting
public
officers
from
its
own
protection
contained
against
self-incrimination
under
article
i,
section
6
at
the
same
time
seeks
to
add
a
proviso
to
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
a
proviso
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
when
no
such
proviso
exists
in
the
federal
constitution.
therefore,
it
is
the
appellant's
position
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
that
the
requirements
are
unconstitutional
for
continued
public
office.
now,
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
have
applied
not
only
to
criminal
sanctions
but
also
to
administrative
sanctions
citing
for
example
(inaudible)
case,
lovett,
and
a
few
other
cases
in
my
brief
so
that
we
have
a
situation
where
there
is
a
penalty
visited
upon
this
appellant
strictly
by
virtue
of
his
invocation
of
a
federally
protected
right.
the
right
--
the
invocation
of
that
right
has
proved
costly
and
it
is
a
federally
protected
right.
the
action
of
the
state
in
new
york
in
requiring
its
public
officers
to
waive
a
federally
protective
requirement
is
not,
i
believe,
a
constitutional
one.
now
this
--
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
has
said
that
garrity
undoubtedly
partially
invalidated
article
i,
section
6
of
the
new
york
state
constitution
but
they
don't
say
what
part
of
that
is
invalid
nor
is
there
any
saving
clause
that
i
could
find
in
the
new
york
state
constitution
saying
that
a
part
of
a
section
is
declared
unconstitutional.
the
rest
survives.
at
any
rate,
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
that
the
question
when
gardner
was
before
the
grand
jury
and
all
the
way
up
to
the
time
of
the
court
of
appeals
decided
its
case
and
including
today,
they
have
said
that
this
is
an
open
question
that
this
court
has
left
the
question
open.
yet,
they
have
countenance
by
their
affirmation.
the
full
penalty
against
this
appellant
for
a
cause
of
action
which
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
very
openness
of
the
question
so
we
feel
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
there
is
no
doubt
in
that
in
respect.
however,
it
also
inquired
into
an
area
under
which
he
was
charged
by
the
department
existing
charges
which
to
this
day
have
never
been
disposed
off.
so
that
it
is
--
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
in
new
york
has
said
that
the
appellant
herein
committed
an
act
of
misconduct.
yet,
they
recognized
that
the
very
question
is
an
open
one.
is
the
appellant
held
to
a
higher
degree
of
knowledge
of
the
law
than
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
here
or
his
actions
or
were
his
actions
perfectly
consistent
with
the
very
openness
of
the
question,
which
we
hoped
to
close
today.
the
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
yes,
your
honor.
the
sole
question
at
that
hearing
was
did
he
or
did
he
not
refuse
to
sign
a
waiver?
there
was
a
motion
at
that
hearing
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
there
was
no
automatic
dismissal.
we
have
a
(inaudible)
point
in
that
that
the
mere
invocation
of
the
constitutional
privilege
is
not
an
act
of
misconduct
as
far
as
we're
--
as
far
as
the
appellant
is
concern.
we
have
a
situation
also
where
to
apply
this
statute
as
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
has
applied
it.
we
would
have
a
shift
of
burden
of
proof
of
misconduct
when
the
precepts
of
due
process
of
law
and
the
statutes
involved
in
the
state
of
new
york
placed
that
burden
upon
the
prosecution.
the
prosecuting
authority
of
the
state
in
new
york
by
an
extrinsic
independent
evidence
must
come
up
--
prove
acts
of
misconduct,
substantive
acts
of
misconduct.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
yes,
your
honor.
if
it
appears
that
there
was
a
disciplinary
reason
for
asking
it
rather
than
a
supervisory
one.
for
example,
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
yes.
if
it
appears
that
his
answers
will
tend
to
incriminate
him,
either
disciplinary
action
for
example.
i
feel
that
he
would
have
a
right
to
maintain
silence.
if
it
is
used
to
investigate
for
supervisory
reasons,
for
example
strengthening
patrols
in
the
certain
area
or
even
suspending
him
pending
investigation
of
extrinsic
evidence,
then
for
that
limited
purpose,
i
would
say
that
he
could
answer
it.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
if
it
is
limited
strictly
to
supervisory
will
not
be
used
against
him
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
--
in
a
disciplinary
sense,
then
i
would
say
that
his
refusal
to
answer,
in
addition
to
the
extrinsic
evidence
of
the
fact
of
the
killing
and
the
gunshot
and
the
ballistics
test,
it
would
be
illegal
residuum
there
to
support
a
dismissal
if
the
request
were
for
a
supervisory
rather
than
a
disciplinary
reason.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
you
have,
you
have.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
my
answer
is
that
if
--
if
the
--
it
goes
back
again,
your
honor
to
the
purpose
of
the
questioning.
if
he
is
assured,
if
he's
granted
in
effect
immunity
from
prosecution,
administrative
or
otherwise,
then
that's
another
ins
--
another
situation
as
not
being
used
against
him.
it's
being
used
either
to
strengthen
patrols
or
get
him
off
a
sensitive
post
or
whatever
it
is.
but
if
it's
going
to
be
used
against
him
in
a
disciplinary
sense,
then
the
state
would
just
have
to
unfortunately
content
itself
with
gathering
extrinsic
evidence
independently
gathered
to
discharge
this
officer.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
especially
--
yes,
especially,
if
he's
under
departmental
charges,
which
he
was
in
this
case
and
if
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
i
don't
think
his
answers
there
can
be
used
against
him,
your
honor.
there
can
be
--
they
--
at
that
point,
he
is
the
focus
of
an
investigation
and
once
that
comes,
we
have
constitutional
--
the
questions
arising,
a
constitutional
objections
to
his
response.
if
he
is
being
accused,
he
has
a
right
to
be
confronted
by
his
accusers
and
cross-examine
him
before
he
has
a
duty
particularly
to
go
ahead
with
the
evidence
to
counter
it.
so
state
must
have
a
extrinsic
evidence
which
would
result
in
a
legal
residuum.
under
those
instances
if
they
have
enough
to
dismiss
him,
his
silence
would
advance
no
tenable
reason
in
mitigation,
extenuation
or
explanation
for
his
continued
service
but
his
silence
again
cannot
be
used
as
a
confession
of
guilt
under
any
circumstances.
we
have
a
situation
where
the
state
is
attempting
to
add
a
state
proviso
to
a
federal
constitutional
provision.
under
malloy
against
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
your
honor,
the
refusal
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
under
this
section
mandates
dismissal.
it's
not
discretionary.
they
say,
"well,
we'll
give
him
a
hearing".
what's
the
hearing
have
to
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
well,
in
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
the
legislative
determination
at
that
instance
runs
contrary
to
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
therefore
must
fall
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
yes,
your
honor.
well,
that
is
the
position
that
the
appellant
takes
in
this
case.
there
are
no
--
now
the
reservations
in
spevack
against
klein,
footnote
3
and
also
mr.
justice
fortas'
reservation
in
that
case,
spoke
about
a
silence
at
a
disciplinary
hearing.
the
appellant's
silence
in
this
instance
was
not
at
the
disciplinary
hearing.
it
was
a
grand
jury
hearing
without
disciplinary
powers
with
powers
to
indict.
it
was
a
criminal
investigation
so
i
think
that
the
reservations
there
--
i
don't
agree
with
them
but
i
don't
think
they
apply
in
this
case.
i
think
that
the
reservations
are
not
appropriate
either
because
there
would
be
a
violation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
which
applies
to
states
here.
again,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
there's
no
--
at
this
hearing
that
they
give,
the
hearing.
the
dismissal
is
mandatory.
the
hearing,
in
my
opinion
in
this
case
where
he
gave
adequate
and
good
reason
for
his
failure
to
answer
questions
and
that
being
that
he
was
a
target
of
the
investigation
and
was
illegally
subpoenaed.
now
it
was
a
reason,
the
reason
was
before
the
commissioner
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
he
had
an
adequate
and
good
reason,
explanation
at
this
hearing.
you
see
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
he
had
an
adequate
and
good
reason
--
mr.
ronald
podolsky
he
was
an
--
he
had
an
adequate
and
good
reason
for
objecting
to
his
very
presence
in
the
grand
jury
room
that
a
subpoena
was
illegal
on
the
ground
that
he
was
a
target
of
the
investigation
and
under
bernoff
against
amoroso
cited
in
my
brief,
this
subpoena
probably
was
illegal
and
--
thank
you.
thank
you.
mr.
ronald
podolsky
your
honor
the
appellant
waives
rebuttal.
