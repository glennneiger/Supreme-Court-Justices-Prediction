justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
question
as
to
whether
the
issues
before
the
grand
jury
matters
upon
which
petitioner
was
going
to
be
questioned?
is
there
any
doubt
that
those
questions
were
related
to
the
scope
of
his
duty
as
a
policeman?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
this
policeman
were
brought
up
on
charges
that
--
suppose
there's
a
grand
jury
investigation
and
it
was
known
that
the
focus
of
that
grand
jury
investigation
was
a
charge
that
he
had
shot
and
killed
a
man
while
he,
the
policeman
was
on
duty?
and
he
was
called
to
testify.
let's
assume
he
refused
to
testify
and
he
refused
to
sign
a
waiver
of
immunity
on
the
--
both
on
the
fifth
amendment
grounds.
would
the
--
could
be
a
constitutional
principle
in
your
opinion
that
would
prevent
the
state
from
discharging
him
as
a
policeman?
justice
abe
fortas
tell
me,
what's
--
would
you
say
that
again?
justice
abe
fortas
oh!
the
case
i
have
put
to
you
they
say
1429.
it's
not
a
good
idea
to
have
policeman
on
our
force
who
go
around
shooting
people
instead
of
arresting
them
and
so
we
want
to
look
into
this
and
this
is
purely
supervising.
that's
what
they
say
and
then
can
--
then
is
the
state
justified
in
dismissing
him?
justice
abe
fortas
he
told
me
if
that
ruling
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
so
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
the
bar
is
not
absolute.
i
beg
your
pardon,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
abe
fortas
the
bar
is
not
an
absolute
one.
that
is
to
say,
it
is
not
in
every
case
where
the
policeman
claims
a
fifth
amendment
protection
that
the
state
is
disenabled
by
a
reason
of
the
federal
constitution
from
dismissing
the
man
from
public
service.
have
i
stated
that
clearly
enough?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what's
your
answer?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
the
issue?
justice
abe
fortas
but
general,
suppose
this
man
had
been
dismissed
from
service
for
a
refusal
to
sign
a
waiver
and
period,
nothing
more.
is
that
different
in
your
submission
from
the
result
that
they
would've
obtained
if
you
knew
this
case
has
a
dismissal
for
refusal
to
answer
questions
with
respect
to
his
official
duties?
and
if
there
is
a
difference,
what
consequences
would
you
attach
to
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
also
it's
very
arguable
that
he
has
an
immunity
by
reason
of
federal
law,
federal
constitutional
law
against
being
prosecuted
in
the
event
that
he
makes
such
disclosures.
justice
abe
fortas
an
immunity
which
the
waiver
seeks
to
defeat.
justice
abe
fortas
but
suppose
if
he
signs
a
waiver?
the
waiver
is
pro
tanto
inoperative
by
reason
of
garrity,
is
that
your
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
statement?
justice
abe
fortas
but
they've
done
it
--
but
if
on
the
other
hand,
your
view
of
this
particular
case
as
a
refusal
by
the
officer
to
answer
questions
with
respect
to
his
--
whether
he
did
or
did
not
take
bribes
or
shot
a
fellow
on
the
street
or
whatnot,
of
course,
from
his
official
duties.
then
you
said
it's
an
easier
case?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
didn't
know
it
is
different
because
you're
charging
him
now
with
the
knowledge
that
he
wouldn't
--
that
the
signing
of
the
waiver
would
be
ineffective.
justice
abe
fortas
but
he
has,
i
suppose
--
he
could
say
well
if
it's
going
to
be
ineffective
whether
these
fellows
want
me
to
sign
it
or
whether
they'd
fire
me
for
signing
it.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
may
be
a
very
different
case
and
if
a
man
--
a
public
official
or
policeman
were
fired
because
of
his
refusal
to
answer
questions
within
the
narrowly
defined
scope
of
his
official
responsibility.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
did
your
court
of
appeals
treat
it
as
your
brother
said,
as
i
understand
him,
did
the
court
of
appeals
treat
this
as
the
case
in
which
he
refused
to
answer
the
questions
as
well
as
case
of
refusal
to
sign
a
waiver?
justice
abe
fortas
because
--
if
i
were
just
to
waive
a
case
as
i
read
with
great
difficulty
of
the
concurrence
that
i
wrote
in
spevack
against
klein
this
would
not
be
covered.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
that
would
be
different
kind
of
a
situation.
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
--
would
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
defending
--
are
you
saying
that
despite
the
fifth
amendment
in
garrity,
a
public
official
may
be
forced
to
sign
a
waiver
from
payment
being
discharged?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
but
you're
not
defending
that
were
clear
then,
we're
in
agreement
that
the
--
you
cannot
dismiss
a
public
employee
because
of
his
refusal
to
sign
a
waiver
of
criminal
prosecution
and
if
that
is
the
thrust
of
garrity.
that's
what
i'd
like
to
get
cleared
general?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
a
public
employee
is
required
to
sign
a
waiver
for
a
criminal
--
a
waiver
of
immunity
against
criminal
prosecution.he
refuses
to
do
so
and
that's
all.
that's
all
it's
present
in
the
case.
can
he
be
dismissed
for
his
refusal
to
sign
that
waiver?
that's
as
distinguished
from
a
dismissal
for
refusal
to
answer
questions
as
to
his
performance
of
his
duty.
justice
abe
fortas
then
he
would
say
--
what
--
why
do
you
want
me
to
sign
this.
is
this
some
exercise
in
penmanship?
but
he
weren't
told
that
here
anyway,
was
he?
