any

waive
a

that
if
the

has
two
shots
at

one,
without
a
jury

then
he
can
present
his
case
for
the
question

guilty

not

and
i'm
assuming

if
there's
problem
before
the
judge
handling
the
way
of
the
jury
and
then
refer
to
the
jury,
separately
in

the
question

penalty,
he
can
bring
the
changes
on
the

as
if
he
went
to
have
a
trial
before
a
jury
in
the
first
instance

after
you
produce
everything
right
then
to
take
his
chances
about

facts
of
mitigation
on
the

i
know
the
words
and
i
should
think
that
the
conclusion
from
the
consideration
that
you
just
have
mentioned,
they're
just
opposite.
justice
abe
fortas
we
are
assuming
that
the
government
--
we
are
assuming
the
government's
argument
here.
that
is
to
say
that
the
judge
couldn't
impanel
a
jury
where
the
judge
wanted
to
have
a
consideration
given
to
the
question
of
the
death
sentence.
justice
abe
fortas
the
point
of
my
brother
from
what
you've
said
is
not
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute
but
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
under
the
statute.
now,
if
that
were
the
holding,
that
would
eliminate
a
possible
prejudice
to
the
request
for
a
jury,
would
it
not?
suppose
in
effect
by
decision
of
this
court
or
otherwise,
a
possibility
of
imposing
the
death
penalty
under
this
statute
where
eliminated
because
of
its
chilling
effect
on
jury
trial,
then
there'd
be
no
more
discrimination
under
the
statute.
the
statute
itself
would
be
constitutional
but
it
would
not
be
possible
to
impose
a
death
penalty
under
it.
justice
abe
fortas
but
why
is
that
perfectly
permissible
result
here.
i
know
it
didn't
get
your
client
out
of
it

out
of
the
jury's
file

why
is
it
illogical
for

here.
