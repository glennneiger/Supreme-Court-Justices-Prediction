mr.
steven
b.
duke
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
first
like
to
make
it
clear
in
connection
with
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
brennan
that
our
position
quite
adequately
and
quite
positively
is
that
even
if
all
the
positions
of
statutory
construction
urged
upon
the
court
by
the
government
are
accepted,
the
statute
can
still
plainly
invalid
and
i
will
attempt
to
develop
that
at
some
length.
preliminarily
on
some
of
the
statutory
interpretation
points,
we
first
would
like
to
urge
the
language
of
the
statute
which
says
that
the
death
penalty
shall
be
imposed
--
shall
be
imposed
--
the
words
are
the
defendant
shall
be
punished
by
death
if
the
kidnapped
person
has
not
been
liberated
unharmed
and
if
the
verdict
of
the
jury
shall
so
recommend.
now,
we
think
the
words
if
the
verdict
of
the
jury
refers
in
their
plainness
sense
when
viewed
in
context
to
a
body
of
man
to
decide
guilt
or
innocence.
the
word
verdict
itself
was
defined
by
webster
as
the
decision
of
a
jury
on
the
matter
submitted
on
trial.
and
the
statute
itself
refers
to
the
jury,
not
a
jury,
the
jury,
do
you
think
congress
pretty
clearly
had
in
mind
the
12
people
that
decide
guilt
or
innocence.
that
is
where
the
statute
puts
the
sole
authority
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
thus,
it's
our
point
that
the
statute
forbids
any
death
penalty
imposed
by
anybody
other
than
the
12
men
who
decide
guilt
or
innocence.
in
other
words,
no
one
can
receive
the
death
penalty
without
claiming
jury
trial.
he
does
claim
a
jury
trial
or
he
doesn't
perceive
a
jury
trial,
he
cannot
perceive
the
death
penalty.
now
surely,
the
contrary
argument
can
be
made.
the
government
makes
it.
they
make
the
argument
in
the
interest
of
humane
construction
but
if
the
government's
argument
is
an
intention
--
an
effort
to
extend
and
broaden
the
scope
of
the
death
penalty.
the
plain
words
of
the
statute
authorize
the
death
penalty
only
in
a
very
limited
number
of
cases
namely
those
of
which
there's
a
trial
by
jury.
the
government
ask
this
court
to
do
is
to
decide
that
notwithstanding
that
there
is
no
clear
expression
in
the
statute,
a
death
penalty
should
be
permissible
even
when
a
man
pleads
guilty
whether
or
not,
he
gets
the
jury
trial.
now,
we
think
there
is
a
sound
principle
that
competes
against
the
contention
that
vagueness
should
be
construed
in
favor
of
constitutionality.
that
principle
is
the
one
applied
in
kent
against
dulles
namely
that
when
constitutionally
protected
rights
are
involved,
these
rights
are
not
curved
by
vague
language.
if
the
congress
is
going
to
curve
constitutionally
protected
rights,
they
must
do
so
clearly
and
explicitly.
in
kent
against
dulles,
the
constitutionally
protected
rights
were
the
right
to
travel.
here,
the
right
cannot
be
over
emphasized.
the
right
involved
here
is
the
right
to
live.
and
surely,
the
right
to
life,
this
is
entitled
to
application
of
kent
against
dulles
as
the
right
to
travel.
in
short,
the
humane
construction
of
this
statute
is
to
take
it
no
further
than
these
words
require
to
limit
the
death
penalty
only
to
cases
in
which
there
has
been
trial
by
jury.
given
that
interpretation,
there's
no
issue
as
i
understand
that
above
the
invalidity
of
the
statute.
that
is
the
way
where
the
statute
means
is
plainly
invalid.
now,
on
the
issue
of
the
mandatoriness
of
the
death
penalty
when
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
whether
there
could
be
a
penalty
determination?
mr.
steven
b.
duke
oh!
i
said
there
could
only
be
a
death
penalty
imposed
if
there
is
a
jury
trial.
i
based
that
on
the
language
of
the
statute.
now,
as
so
far
as
the
legislative
history
is
concerned,
there
is
no
record
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history
to
a
penalty
jury.
that
is
a
jury
which
decides
penalty
other
than
in
the
context
and
at
the
same
time,
of
deciding
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
that
he
cannot
waive
the
jury
trial?
no,
we
think
he
can
waive
the
jury
trial.
we
don't
think
he
can
validly
do
it.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
he
cannot
enter
a
valid
waiver
of
the
jury
trial,
that's
correct
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
yes.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
oh!
not
at
all.
and
the
reason
he
couldn't
validly
waive
the
jury
trial
under
this
statute,
is
that
he
would
do
so
under
strong
coercion.
he
does
it
because
he
is
attempting
to
avoid
the
death
penalty
and
that's
what
would
invalidate
the
waiver.
now,
i
wouldn't
belabor
the
question
of
whether
the
jury
verdict
of
death
is
or
is
not
mandatory.
i
think
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
makes
it
mandatory.
it
says
that
the
defendant
shall
be
punished
if
the
jury,
by
death,
if
the
jury
so
recommends.
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be
any
plainer.
i
don't
agree
with
the
government
that
the
legislative
history
sheds
no
light
on
the
matter.
i
refer
to
appellees
brief
on
page
19
in
which
it
was
the
congressional
record,
75
congressional
record
13297
in
which
the
provision
was
explained
as
taking
the
onus
of
inflicting
death
from
the
jury.
now,
the
onus
of
inflicting
death
will
not
be
taken
from
the
jury
if
in
fact
it
was
the
judge's
decision
in
the
final
analysis.
the
house
report
on
this
amendment
to
the
act
says
that
the
amendment
permits
the
jury
to
designated
death
penalty
for
the
kidnapper.
well,
that
sounds
as
if
the
jury
is
the
body
that
makes
the
decision.
i
would
also
refer
the
court
to
winston
against
the
united
states
decided
by
this
court
in
1899
in
which
the
court
said
in
connection
with
the
murder
statute,
that
the
decision
of
life
or
death
is
put
by
congress
solely
and
exclusively
in
the
lap
of
the
jury.
indeed,
that
decision
indicated
that
it
would
be
improper
for
the
trial
judge
even
to
instruct
on
the
criteria
which
the
jury
should
employ
in
deciding
the
penalty
question.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
that
the
penalty
be
fixed
by
the
court
including
the
death
penalty.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
i
don't
believe
under
this
statute,
he
could
enter
such
a
valid
waiver
because
he
could
not
avoid
the
coercion.
that
is
until
the
statute
is
--
until
a
threat
of
the
death
penalty
in
connection
with
the
jury
trial
is
somehow
removed
as
long
as
it
hangs
over
the
defendant
who's
attempting
to
waive
the
jury,
he
cannot
enter
a
voluntary
waiver.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
yes,
it
is,
mr.
justice.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
well,
i'm
glad
you
ask
the
question.
that
is
an
alternative
argument
made
in
the
government's
reply
brief
namely
that
if
there
is
an
infirmity
in
the
statute,
the
remedy
is
really
to
invalidate
the
guilty
pleas
and
the
jury
waivers
like
what
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
no,
if
the
statute
imposes
an
undue
burden
on
right
to
jury
trial
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
no.
mr.
justice
white,
the
reason
why
it
is
no
answer
to
suggest
that
a
valid
guilty
plea
or
a
valid
jury
waiver
cannot
be
entered
is
that
the
defendant
is
not
in
the
position
to
raise
that
question.
he
is
threatened
with
the
death
penalty.
he
sees
enough
penalty
to
avoid
the
death
penalty
by
pleading
guilty.
he
pleads
guilty.
is
he
go
and
turn
around
and
say
the
next
day,
your
honor,
that
was
invalid?
mr.
steven
b.
duke
had
that
been
the
case,
no
pleas
of
guilty
and
no
waiver
of
jury
trials?
mr.
steven
b.
duke
yes.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
if
the
statute
clearly
forbad
a
waiver
of
jury
trial
in
the
kidnapping
case
and
the
guilty
plea,
all
i
would
say
is
we'll
have
a
much
different
case
than
we
have
here.
but
i
would
simply
point
out
that
even
that
is
very
bothersome
because
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
in
1913
attempted
to
solve
the
similar
difficulty
under
the
dc
rape
statute.
and
the
court
said
in
green
against
the
united
states,
if
this
rape
statute
permitted
a
guilty
plea
it
would
be
plainly
beyond
unconstitutional,
therefore
we
hold
it
no
guilty
plea
is
permitted.
what
happened?
people
continued
to
plea
guilty.
people
can
--
their
guilty
pleas
continued
to
be
accepted.
so
that's
the
way
that
kind
of
a
remedy
worked
out
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
that
is
my
position,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
well
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
i'll
turn
to
that,
mr.
justice
black.
that
is
the
alternative
construction
that
the
government
offers
in
order
to
save
the
statute.
namely,
the
one
of
that
several
attorneys,
namely
give
the
judge
the
power
to
impanel
a
penalty
jury
in
all
cases;
guilty
plea
cases,
jury
waive
cases,
in
other
words,
to
eliminate
any
absolute
waive
whereby
the
defendant
might
avoid
the
jury
trial
on
the
penalty
issue.
now,
our
contention
is
and
the
decision
--
the
judge
below
decided
that
even
that,
that
that
is
a
reasonable
construction
of
the
statute
it
doesn't
say
it
because
the
judge
has
complete
discretion
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
impanel
a
jury.
he
doesn't
have
that
discretion
when
there's
a
trial
by
jury,
trial
of
guilt
or
innocence
at
least
under
our
reading
of
the
statute
or
under
such
case
where
there
is
he
must
submit
it
to
the
jury.
but
even
if
we're
wrong
on
that,
that
is
even
if
he
has
--
the
judge,
has
complete
discretion
in
all
cases
to
submit
it
to
the
jury
or
not
to
submit
to
the
jury,
then
we
get
down
to
the
point
that
i
began
with,
and
that
mr.
justice
brennan
raised,
namely,
is
there
any
constitutional
question
left?
and
i
submit
there
still
is.
the
statute
is
still
unconstitutional.
and
if
i
can
state
it
very
simply,
the
reason
is,
the
two
very
different
procedures
are
set
up
to
determine
the
death
penalty,
to
determine
whether
the
man
lives
or
dies,
and
whether
one
procedure
or
the
other
procedure
applies
to
the
defendant
turns
on
whether
or
not
he
waives
or
claims
a
jury
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence.
and
i
submit
that
that's
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
what
should
be
a
free
choice.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
yes,
that's
precisely
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
absolutely,
mr.
justice
brennan.
if
i
can
explain
--
let's
assume
that
again,
the
judge
in
both
cases,
guilty
plea
or
any
kind
of
case,
can
refuse
to
submit
the
issue
of
death
penalty
to
the
jury.
then
once
having
submitted
to
the
jury
and
getting
the
affirmative
recommendation,
he
can
reject
it.
in
any
case,
still
if
anything
is
clear
in
the
statute
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
as
long
as
he
has
the
authority,
the
discretion
to
accept
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
yes,
yes,
if
he
can
neither
accept
nor
reject.
if
in
fact
a
jury
verdict
is
wholly
meaningless,
then
there's
no
problem.
but
the
point
is
that
in
the
--where
the
jury
is
deciding
guilt
or
innocence,
and
the
question
of
death
penalty
is
to
be
put
to
that
jury,
that
question
is
put
to
the
jury
in
a
very
different
context,
then
it
would
be
put
if
there
were
not
a
trial
of
guilt.
in
the
first
place,
the
defendant
is
in
the
quandary.
if
he
really
wants
a
jury
trial
on
the
issue
of
guilt,
he
doesn't
want
to
mockery
with
the
jury
trial
on
the
issue
of
guilt.
he
has
to
contest
the
government's
evidence
of
guilt.
he
has
to
underplay
the
issue
of
mitigating
circumstances.
he
can't
at
the
same
time
effectively
say
to
the
jury,
“i
didn't
do
it
but
if
you
think
i
did
it,
here's
the
reason
i
did
it.
i'm
not
really
such
a
bad
guy.”
but
where
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
is
not
in
the
case,
the
only
question
the
jury
is
deciding
is,
does
this
man
live
or
die,
that
the
procedural
posture
is
much
different.
then
one
objecting
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
well,
if
i
understand
your
question
mr.
justice
fortas,
your
point
if
i
understand
it
is
it
would
be
better
off
trying
guilt
waiving
the
jury
before
the
judge,
getting
his
guilt
determined
and
then
getting
the
jury
determination
of
sentence.
it
would
be
better
off
in
terms
of
the
death
penalty
than
having
both
determine
at
the
same
time,
possibly
so
but
does
he
have
any
right
to
do
that
if
this
court's
decision
in
singer
applies
in
this
context,
he
has
no
right
to
make
that
choice.
he
has
no
right
to
tell
the
judge,
“i'll
have
a
non-jury
trial
on
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence.
i
object
to
any
jury
being
in
the
case
on
that
question.
i
want
a
fresh
jury
after
the
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence.”
mr.
steven
b.
duke
well,
yes,
the
judge
could
impanel
a
jury
but
there's
no
contention
made
that
the
defendant
has
a
right
again
to
insist
on
a
penalty
jury
alone
quite
separate
from
his
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
he
wants
a
jury
trial.
in
any
event,
when
he
pleads
guilty,
that's
the
easiest
case
of
the
non-jury
trial
as
awfully
complicated
because
in
my
view,
singer
doesn't
clearly
apply
here
because
singer
left
open
the
situation
where
the
government
has
an
ignoble
purpose
in
insisting
on
the
right
to
--
its
own
right
to
a
jury
trial.
and
indeed,
it's
hard
to
think
of
a
more
ignoble
purpose
than
what
might
exist
in
the
prosecutor's
mind.
i
insist
on
a
jury
trial
because
i'm
going
to
insist
that
the
death
penalty
issue
be
put
before
a
jury
if
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
prosecutor
and
certainly,
that's
a
possible
purpose.
indeed
one
might
say
that
singer
doesn't
apply
here
and
the
defendant
does
in
terms
of
singer
have
a
right
to
waive
a
jury.
but
if
i
can
simply
compare
the
guilty
plea
situation,
the
man,
the
defendant
pleads
guilty.
now,
the
judge
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
ignoble
i
suppose
one
can
argue
about,
if
his
purpose
in
demanding
it
was
to
induce
the
defendant
out
of
fear
of
his
own
life
to
plead
guilty.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
but
if
i
can
simply
direct
your
attention
to
the
guilty
plea
situation,
there
the
defendant
pleads
guilty.
the
question
is
put
to
the
judge;
do
i
impanel
a
jury
assuming
again
that
he
has
the
power
to
do
so?
do
i
impanel
a
jury
or
do
i
not?
first
of
all,
the
pressure
is
against
that
question.
first
of
all,
it's
a
virtually
non-existing
procedure.
there
was
nothing
so
far
as
we've
been
able
to
uncover
in
1934
regarding
a
penalty
jury
in
federal
criminal
cases.
and
it's
--
even
today,
it's
a
very
seldom
used
procedure.
what
criteria
does
the
judge
used
to
determine
qualifications
of
the
jurors?
what
kind
of
procedure
does
he
use
to
determine
penalty?
all
these
uncertainties
weigh
against
his
affirmative
calling
in
of
the
jury.
secondly,
he
offsets
the
expectations
of
the
defendant.
the
defendant
presumably
expects
the
judge
will
accept
the
guilty
plea
and
not
invoke
a
penalty
jury.
he
will
upset
those
expectations
and
produce
possibly
a
motion
for
withdrawal
if
he
does
call
in
a
penalty
jury.
another
factor
against
the
probability
that
a
penalty
jury
will
be
impaneled
is
that
the
judge
makes
his
decision
without
any
benefit,
of
any
gruesome
facts,
or
any
tearful
witnesses,
he
does
it
on
the
cold
record.
in
short,
it
would
be
a
very
strong
and
determined
and
unusual
judge
who
would
impanel
a
death
penalty
jury
after
a
guilty
plea
if
it
was
in
his
discretion
to
do
otherwise.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
a
very
--
a
judge
very
determined
to
pave
the
way
to
the
defendant's
being
killed.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
now,
where
the
defendant
demands
a
jury
trial
of
his
guilt,
all
the
judge
does
again
assuming
that
he
has
a
discretion
which
we
deny
he
does
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
the
discretion
to
submit
the
death
penalty
of
the
jury
or
not
to
submit
it.
we
contend
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
once
the
defendant
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
no,
mr.
justice
black,
i
mean
--
i'm
saying
that
assuming
that
the
defendant
claims
and
gets
trial
by
jury
on
the
issue
of
guilt,
then
at
the
end
of
the
case,
the
question
is
to
the
judge,
“do
i
submit
the
death
penalty
of
the
jury
or
not?”
now,
i
say
that
the
judge
must
submit
it,
at
least
if
requested
by
the
prosecution.
but
the
point
is
that
even
if
it's
wholly
discretionary,
all
he
has
to
do
to
submit
it
is
to
insert
that
in
this
charge.
there's
no
big
issue,
no
spotlight.
he's
not
upsetting
anybody's
expectation
so
it
seems
to
me
the
chances
are
far
greater
when
the
guilt
or
innocence
is
determined
by
jury
trial
that
in
fact
the
death
penalty
issue
will
be
submitted
to
a
jury.
and
i
repeat
a
jury
that
is
decided
and
is
contaminated
in
the
sense
by
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence.
if
it
seems
to
me
utterly
preposterous
to
suppose
except
in
a
most
unusual
circumstance
that
the
defendant's
chances
of
avoiding
a
death
penalty
are
not
much
better
by
waiving
a
jury
trial
and/or
by
pleading
guilty
than
the
reverse.
now,
even
if
i'm
wrong
and
this
is
my
final
argument
on
this
point,
even
if
i'm
completely
wrong
on
everything
i've
said,
i
could
be
right
or
at
least
an
attorney,
a
defendant,
could
agree
with
my
evaluation
of
the
probabilities.
after
all,
we're
dealing
here
with
a
--
and
to
some
extent
with
a
totally
uncharted
sea.
this
provision
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
well
that's
--
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
perfectly
proper.
and
indeed
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
this
is
part
of
it.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
well,
i
think
many
of
the
framers
of
the
--
or
the
people
that
put
together
this
amendment
had
in
mind
the
notion
that
they
were
going
to
keep
the
death
penalty
issue
in
the
laps
of
12
men.
and
i
don't
deny
that.
i
don't
object
to
it
but
i
--
on
my
point
is
that
the
way
in
which
they
did
it,
and
there
are
other
ways
to
do
it
--
the
way
in
which
they
did
it,
they
link
to
the
death
--
to
the
determination
of
the
defendant,
“shall
i
waive
the
jury
or
not?”
they
link
to
that
a
very
grizzly
outlook
so
far
as
the
death
penalty
is
concerned.
they
create
two
procedures.
one
much
less
like
they
produce
the
death
penalty
than
the
other.
and
they
make
the
choice
of
those
procedures
turn
on
whether
he
decides
he
wants
guilt
or
innocence
determined
by
a
jury.
in
other
words,
they
made
a
mistake.
they
should
have
done
it
another
way
and
there
are
other
ways
to
do
it
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
if
in
fact,
that
is
the
way
the
law
works
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
well,
i'm
familiar
with
the
new
jersey
statute,
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
the
distinction
there
is
made
between
a
guilty
plea
and
something
called
a
non
volt.
you
can't
enter
a
non
volt
if
the
judge
accepts
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
my
final
point
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
that
--
the
statute
would
be
unconstitutional
--
would
be
perfectly
valid
as
far
as
the
point
raised
here
if
the
possibility
of
the
death
penalty
were
removed
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
i'm
happy
that
you
gave
me
the
time
to
answer
the
question.
the
point
is
that
the
severability
issue
doesn't
arise
properly
until
you
determine,
until
you
locate
the
offensive
provision.
and
in
this
case,
you
simply
can't
locate
the
offending
provision
because
if
you
look
at
the
statute,
you
can
take
the
words
after
by
death,
take
them
out
of
the
statute
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
first
like
to
make
it
clear
in
connection
with
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
brennan
that
our
position
quite
adequately
and
quite
positively
is
that
even
if
all
the
positions
of
statutory
construction
urged
upon
the
court
by
the
government
are
accepted,
the
statute
can
still
plainly
invalid
and
i
will
attempt
to
develop
that
at
some
length.
preliminarily
on
some
of
the
statutory
interpretation
points,
we
first
would
like
to
urge
the
language
of
the
statute
which
says
that
the
death
penalty
shall
be
imposed
--
shall
be
imposed
--
the
words
are
the
defendant
shall
be
punished
by
death
if
the
kidnapped
person
has
not
been
liberated
unharmed
and
if
the
verdict
of
the
jury
shall
so
recommend.
now,
we
think
the
words
if
the
verdict
of
the
jury
refers
in
their
plainness
sense
when
viewed
in
context
to
a
body
of
man
to
decide
guilt
or
innocence.
the
word
verdict
itself
was
defined
by
webster
as
the
decision
of
a
jury
on
the
matter
submitted
on
trial.
and
the
statute
itself
refers
to
the
jury,
not
a
jury,
the
jury,
do
you
think
congress
pretty
clearly
had
in
mind
the
12
people
that
decide
guilt
or
innocence.
that
is
where
the
statute
puts
the
sole
authority
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
thus,
it's
our
point
that
the
statute
forbids
any
death
penalty
imposed
by
anybody
other
than
the
12
men
who
decide
guilt
or
innocence.
in
other
words,
no
one
can
receive
the
death
penalty
without
claiming
jury
trial.
he
does
claim
a
jury
trial
or
he
doesn't
perceive
a
jury
trial,
he
cannot
perceive
the
death
penalty.
now
surely,
the
contrary
argument
can
be
made.
the
government
makes
it.
they
make
the
argument
in
the
interest
of
humane
construction
but
if
the
government's
argument
is
an
intention
--
an
effort
to
extend
and
broaden
the
scope
of
the
death
penalty.
the
plain
words
of
the
statute
authorize
the
death
penalty
only
in
a
very
limited
number
of
cases
namely
those
of
which
there's
a
trial
by
jury.
the
government
ask
this
court
to
do
is
to
decide
that
notwithstanding
that
there
is
no
clear
expression
in
the
statute,
a
death
penalty
should
be
permissible
even
when
a
man
pleads
guilty
whether
or
not,
he
gets
the
jury
trial.
now,
we
think
there
is
a
sound
principle
that
competes
against
the
contention
that
vagueness
should
be
construed
in
favor
of
constitutionality.
that
principle
is
the
one
applied
in
kent
against
dulles
namely
that
when
constitutionally
protected
rights
are
involved,
these
rights
are
not
curved
by
vague
language.
if
the
congress
is
going
to
curve
constitutionally
protected
rights,
they
must
do
so
clearly
and
explicitly.
in
kent
against
dulles,
the
constitutionally
protected
rights
were
the
right
to
travel.
here,
the
right
cannot
be
over
emphasized.
the
right
involved
here
is
the
right
to
live.
and
surely,
the
right
to
life,
this
is
entitled
to
application
of
kent
against
dulles
as
the
right
to
travel.
in
short,
the
humane
construction
of
this
statute
is
to
take
it
no
further
than
these
words
require
to
limit
the
death
penalty
only
to
cases
in
which
there
has
been
trial
by
jury.
given
that
interpretation,
there's
no
issue
as
i
understand
that
above
the
invalidity
of
the
statute.
that
is
the
way
where
the
statute
means
is
plainly
invalid.
now,
on
the
issue
of
the
mandatoriness
of
the
death
penalty
when
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
whether
there
could
be
a
penalty
determination?
mr.
steven
b.
duke
oh!
i
said
there
could
only
be
a
death
penalty
imposed
if
there
is
a
jury
trial.
i
based
that
on
the
language
of
the
statute.
now,
as
so
far
as
the
legislative
history
is
concerned,
there
is
no
record
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history
to
a
penalty
jury.
that
is
a
jury
which
decides
penalty
other
than
in
the
context
and
at
the
same
time,
of
deciding
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
that
he
cannot
waive
the
jury
trial?
no,
we
think
he
can
waive
the
jury
trial.
we
don't
think
he
can
validly
do
it.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
he
cannot
enter
a
valid
waiver
of
the
jury
trial,
that's
correct
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
yes.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
oh!
not
at
all.
and
the
reason
he
couldn't
validly
waive
the
jury
trial
under
this
statute,
is
that
he
would
do
so
under
strong
coercion.
he
does
it
because
he
is
attempting
to
avoid
the
death
penalty
and
that's
what
would
invalidate
the
waiver.
now,
i
wouldn't
belabor
the
question
of
whether
the
jury
verdict
of
death
is
or
is
not
mandatory.
i
think
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
makes
it
mandatory.
it
says
that
the
defendant
shall
be
punished
if
the
jury,
by
death,
if
the
jury
so
recommends.
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be
any
plainer.
i
don't
agree
with
the
government
that
the
legislative
history
sheds
no
light
on
the
matter.
i
refer
to
appellees
brief
on
page
19
in
which
it
was
the
congressional
record,
75
congressional
record
13297
in
which
the
provision
was
explained
as
taking
the
onus
of
inflicting
death
from
the
jury.
now,
the
onus
of
inflicting
death
will
not
be
taken
from
the
jury
if
in
fact
it
was
the
judge's
decision
in
the
final
analysis.
the
house
report
on
this
amendment
to
the
act
says
that
the
amendment
permits
the
jury
to
designated
death
penalty
for
the
kidnapper.
well,
that
sounds
as
if
the
jury
is
the
body
that
makes
the
decision.
i
would
also
refer
the
court
to
winston
against
the
united
states
decided
by
this
court
in
1899
in
which
the
court
said
in
connection
with
the
murder
statute,
that
the
decision
of
life
or
death
is
put
by
congress
solely
and
exclusively
in
the
lap
of
the
jury.
indeed,
that
decision
indicated
that
it
would
be
improper
for
the
trial
judge
even
to
instruct
on
the
criteria
which
the
jury
should
employ
in
deciding
the
penalty
question.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
that
the
penalty
be
fixed
by
the
court
including
the
death
penalty.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
i
don't
believe
under
this
statute,
he
could
enter
such
a
valid
waiver
because
he
could
not
avoid
the
coercion.
that
is
until
the
statute
is
--
until
a
threat
of
the
death
penalty
in
connection
with
the
jury
trial
is
somehow
removed
as
long
as
it
hangs
over
the
defendant
who's
attempting
to
waive
the
jury,
he
cannot
enter
a
voluntary
waiver.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
yes,
it
is,
mr.
justice.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
well,
i'm
glad
you
ask
the
question.
that
is
an
alternative
argument
made
in
the
government's
reply
brief
namely
that
if
there
is
an
infirmity
in
the
statute,
the
remedy
is
really
to
invalidate
the
guilty
pleas
and
the
jury
waivers
like
what
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
no,
if
the
statute
imposes
an
undue
burden
on
right
to
jury
trial
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
no.
mr.
justice
white,
the
reason
why
it
is
no
answer
to
suggest
that
a
valid
guilty
plea
or
a
valid
jury
waiver
cannot
be
entered
is
that
the
defendant
is
not
in
the
position
to
raise
that
question.
he
is
threatened
with
the
death
penalty.
he
sees
enough
penalty
to
avoid
the
death
penalty
by
pleading
guilty.
he
pleads
guilty.
is
he
go
and
turn
around
and
say
the
next
day,
your
honor,
that
was
invalid?
mr.
steven
b.
duke
had
that
been
the
case,
no
pleas
of
guilty
and
no
waiver
of
jury
trials?
mr.
steven
b.
duke
yes.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
if
the
statute
clearly
forbad
a
waiver
of
jury
trial
in
the
kidnapping
case
and
the
guilty
plea,
all
i
would
say
is
we'll
have
a
much
different
case
than
we
have
here.
but
i
would
simply
point
out
that
even
that
is
very
bothersome
because
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
in
1913
attempted
to
solve
the
similar
difficulty
under
the
dc
rape
statute.
and
the
court
said
in
green
against
the
united
states,
if
this
rape
statute
permitted
a
guilty
plea
it
would
be
plainly
beyond
unconstitutional,
therefore
we
hold
it
no
guilty
plea
is
permitted.
what
happened?
people
continued
to
plea
guilty.
people
can
--
their
guilty
pleas
continued
to
be
accepted.
so
that's
the
way
that
kind
of
a
remedy
worked
out
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
that
is
my
position,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
well
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
i'll
turn
to
that,
mr.
justice
black.
that
is
the
alternative
construction
that
the
government
offers
in
order
to
save
the
statute.
namely,
the
one
of
that
several
attorneys,
namely
give
the
judge
the
power
to
impanel
a
penalty
jury
in
all
cases;
guilty
plea
cases,
jury
waive
cases,
in
other
words,
to
eliminate
any
absolute
waive
whereby
the
defendant
might
avoid
the
jury
trial
on
the
penalty
issue.
now,
our
contention
is
and
the
decision
--
the
judge
below
decided
that
even
that,
that
that
is
a
reasonable
construction
of
the
statute
it
doesn't
say
it
because
the
judge
has
complete
discretion
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
impanel
a
jury.
he
doesn't
have
that
discretion
when
there's
a
trial
by
jury,
trial
of
guilt
or
innocence
at
least
under
our
reading
of
the
statute
or
under
such
case
where
there
is
he
must
submit
it
to
the
jury.
but
even
if
we're
wrong
on
that,
that
is
even
if
he
has
--
the
judge,
has
complete
discretion
in
all
cases
to
submit
it
to
the
jury
or
not
to
submit
to
the
jury,
then
we
get
down
to
the
point
that
i
began
with,
and
that
mr.
justice
brennan
raised,
namely,
is
there
any
constitutional
question
left?
and
i
submit
there
still
is.
the
statute
is
still
unconstitutional.
and
if
i
can
state
it
very
simply,
the
reason
is,
the
two
very
different
procedures
are
set
up
to
determine
the
death
penalty,
to
determine
whether
the
man
lives
or
dies,
and
whether
one
procedure
or
the
other
procedure
applies
to
the
defendant
turns
on
whether
or
not
he
waives
or
claims
a
jury
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence.
and
i
submit
that
that's
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
what
should
be
a
free
choice.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
yes,
that's
precisely
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
absolutely,
mr.
justice
brennan.
if
i
can
explain
--
let's
assume
that
again,
the
judge
in
both
cases,
guilty
plea
or
any
kind
of
case,
can
refuse
to
submit
the
issue
of
death
penalty
to
the
jury.
then
once
having
submitted
to
the
jury
and
getting
the
affirmative
recommendation,
he
can
reject
it.
in
any
case,
still
if
anything
is
clear
in
the
statute
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
as
long
as
he
has
the
authority,
the
discretion
to
accept
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
yes,
yes,
if
he
can
neither
accept
nor
reject.
if
in
fact
a
jury
verdict
is
wholly
meaningless,
then
there's
no
problem.
but
the
point
is
that
in
the
--where
the
jury
is
deciding
guilt
or
innocence,
and
the
question
of
death
penalty
is
to
be
put
to
that
jury,
that
question
is
put
to
the
jury
in
a
very
different
context,
then
it
would
be
put
if
there
were
not
a
trial
of
guilt.
in
the
first
place,
the
defendant
is
in
the
quandary.
if
he
really
wants
a
jury
trial
on
the
issue
of
guilt,
he
doesn't
want
to
mockery
with
the
jury
trial
on
the
issue
of
guilt.
he
has
to
contest
the
government's
evidence
of
guilt.
he
has
to
underplay
the
issue
of
mitigating
circumstances.
he
can't
at
the
same
time
effectively
say
to
the
jury,
“i
didn't
do
it
but
if
you
think
i
did
it,
here's
the
reason
i
did
it.
i'm
not
really
such
a
bad
guy.”
but
where
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
is
not
in
the
case,
the
only
question
the
jury
is
deciding
is,
does
this
man
live
or
die,
that
the
procedural
posture
is
much
different.
then
one
objecting
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
well,
if
i
understand
your
question
mr.
justice
fortas,
your
point
if
i
understand
it
is
it
would
be
better
off
trying
guilt
waiving
the
jury
before
the
judge,
getting
his
guilt
determined
and
then
getting
the
jury
determination
of
sentence.
it
would
be
better
off
in
terms
of
the
death
penalty
than
having
both
determine
at
the
same
time,
possibly
so
but
does
he
have
any
right
to
do
that
if
this
court's
decision
in
singer
applies
in
this
context,
he
has
no
right
to
make
that
choice.
he
has
no
right
to
tell
the
judge,
“i'll
have
a
non-jury
trial
on
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence.
i
object
to
any
jury
being
in
the
case
on
that
question.
i
want
a
fresh
jury
after
the
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence.”
mr.
steven
b.
duke
well,
yes,
the
judge
could
impanel
a
jury
but
there's
no
contention
made
that
the
defendant
has
a
right
again
to
insist
on
a
penalty
jury
alone
quite
separate
from
his
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
he
wants
a
jury
trial.
in
any
event,
when
he
pleads
guilty,
that's
the
easiest
case
of
the
non-jury
trial
as
awfully
complicated
because
in
my
view,
singer
doesn't
clearly
apply
here
because
singer
left
open
the
situation
where
the
government
has
an
ignoble
purpose
in
insisting
on
the
right
to
--
its
own
right
to
a
jury
trial.
and
indeed,
it's
hard
to
think
of
a
more
ignoble
purpose
than
what
might
exist
in
the
prosecutor's
mind.
i
insist
on
a
jury
trial
because
i'm
going
to
insist
that
the
death
penalty
issue
be
put
before
a
jury
if
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
prosecutor
and
certainly,
that's
a
possible
purpose.
indeed
one
might
say
that
singer
doesn't
apply
here
and
the
defendant
does
in
terms
of
singer
have
a
right
to
waive
a
jury.
but
if
i
can
simply
compare
the
guilty
plea
situation,
the
man,
the
defendant
pleads
guilty.
now,
the
judge
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
ignoble
i
suppose
one
can
argue
about,
if
his
purpose
in
demanding
it
was
to
induce
the
defendant
out
of
fear
of
his
own
life
to
plead
guilty.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
but
if
i
can
simply
direct
your
attention
to
the
guilty
plea
situation,
there
the
defendant
pleads
guilty.
the
question
is
put
to
the
judge;
do
i
impanel
a
jury
assuming
again
that
he
has
the
power
to
do
so?
do
i
impanel
a
jury
or
do
i
not?
first
of
all,
the
pressure
is
against
that
question.
first
of
all,
it's
a
virtually
non-existing
procedure.
there
was
nothing
so
far
as
we've
been
able
to
uncover
in
1934
regarding
a
penalty
jury
in
federal
criminal
cases.
and
it's
--
even
today,
it's
a
very
seldom
used
procedure.
what
criteria
does
the
judge
used
to
determine
qualifications
of
the
jurors?
what
kind
of
procedure
does
he
use
to
determine
penalty?
all
these
uncertainties
weigh
against
his
affirmative
calling
in
of
the
jury.
secondly,
he
offsets
the
expectations
of
the
defendant.
the
defendant
presumably
expects
the
judge
will
accept
the
guilty
plea
and
not
invoke
a
penalty
jury.
he
will
upset
those
expectations
and
produce
possibly
a
motion
for
withdrawal
if
he
does
call
in
a
penalty
jury.
another
factor
against
the
probability
that
a
penalty
jury
will
be
impaneled
is
that
the
judge
makes
his
decision
without
any
benefit,
of
any
gruesome
facts,
or
any
tearful
witnesses,
he
does
it
on
the
cold
record.
in
short,
it
would
be
a
very
strong
and
determined
and
unusual
judge
who
would
impanel
a
death
penalty
jury
after
a
guilty
plea
if
it
was
in
his
discretion
to
do
otherwise.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
a
very
--
a
judge
very
determined
to
pave
the
way
to
the
defendant's
being
killed.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
now,
where
the
defendant
demands
a
jury
trial
of
his
guilt,
all
the
judge
does
again
assuming
that
he
has
a
discretion
which
we
deny
he
does
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
the
discretion
to
submit
the
death
penalty
of
the
jury
or
not
to
submit
it.
we
contend
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
once
the
defendant
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
no,
mr.
justice
black,
i
mean
--
i'm
saying
that
assuming
that
the
defendant
claims
and
gets
trial
by
jury
on
the
issue
of
guilt,
then
at
the
end
of
the
case,
the
question
is
to
the
judge,
“do
i
submit
the
death
penalty
of
the
jury
or
not?”
now,
i
say
that
the
judge
must
submit
it,
at
least
if
requested
by
the
prosecution.
but
the
point
is
that
even
if
it's
wholly
discretionary,
all
he
has
to
do
to
submit
it
is
to
insert
that
in
this
charge.
there's
no
big
issue,
no
spotlight.
he's
not
upsetting
anybody's
expectation
so
it
seems
to
me
the
chances
are
far
greater
when
the
guilt
or
innocence
is
determined
by
jury
trial
that
in
fact
the
death
penalty
issue
will
be
submitted
to
a
jury.
and
i
repeat
a
jury
that
is
decided
and
is
contaminated
in
the
sense
by
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence.
if
it
seems
to
me
utterly
preposterous
to
suppose
except
in
a
most
unusual
circumstance
that
the
defendant's
chances
of
avoiding
a
death
penalty
are
not
much
better
by
waiving
a
jury
trial
and/or
by
pleading
guilty
than
the
reverse.
now,
even
if
i'm
wrong
and
this
is
my
final
argument
on
this
point,
even
if
i'm
completely
wrong
on
everything
i've
said,
i
could
be
right
or
at
least
an
attorney,
a
defendant,
could
agree
with
my
evaluation
of
the
probabilities.
after
all,
we're
dealing
here
with
a
--
and
to
some
extent
with
a
totally
uncharted
sea.
this
provision
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
well
that's
--
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
perfectly
proper.
and
indeed
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
this
is
part
of
it.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
well,
i
think
many
of
the
framers
of
the
--
or
the
people
that
put
together
this
amendment
had
in
mind
the
notion
that
they
were
going
to
keep
the
death
penalty
issue
in
the
laps
of
12
men.
and
i
don't
deny
that.
i
don't
object
to
it
but
i
--
on
my
point
is
that
the
way
in
which
they
did
it,
and
there
are
other
ways
to
do
it
--
the
way
in
which
they
did
it,
they
link
to
the
death
--
to
the
determination
of
the
defendant,
“shall
i
waive
the
jury
or
not?”
they
link
to
that
a
very
grizzly
outlook
so
far
as
the
death
penalty
is
concerned.
they
create
two
procedures.
one
much
less
like
they
produce
the
death
penalty
than
the
other.
and
they
make
the
choice
of
those
procedures
turn
on
whether
he
decides
he
wants
guilt
or
innocence
determined
by
a
jury.
in
other
words,
they
made
a
mistake.
they
should
have
done
it
another
way
and
there
are
other
ways
to
do
it
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
if
in
fact,
that
is
the
way
the
law
works
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
well,
i'm
familiar
with
the
new
jersey
statute,
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
the
distinction
there
is
made
between
a
guilty
plea
and
something
called
a
non
volt.
you
can't
enter
a
non
volt
if
the
judge
accepts
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
my
final
point
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
that
--
the
statute
would
be
unconstitutional
--
would
be
perfectly
valid
as
far
as
the
point
raised
here
if
the
possibility
of
the
death
penalty
were
removed
--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
i'm
happy
that
you
gave
me
the
time
to
answer
the
question.
the
point
is
that
the
severability
issue
doesn't
arise
properly
until
you
determine,
until
you
locate
the
offensive
provision.
and
in
this
case,
you
simply
can't
locate
the
offending
provision
because
if
you
look
at
the
statute,
you
can
take
the
words
after
by
death,
take
them
out
of
the
statute
--
