mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice
and
your
honors.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
taken
by
the
united
states
from
the
district
court
in
connecticut,
dismissing
a
kidnapping
indictment
returned
against
the
three
appellees
here.
an
indictment
which
alleged
among
other
things
that
the
victim
had
not
been
liberated
unharmed.
the
ground
of
the
court's
dismissal
is
that
the
penalty
provisions
of
the
kidnapping
act
operate
in
a
way
that
creates
an
inducement
to
waive
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
jury
trial.
the
district
court
analogized
this
case
to
griffin
against
california,
stating
that
the
scheme
made
the
assertion
of
the
constitutional
right
foster.
now,
the
penalty
provisions
of
the
kidnapping
act
appear
at
page
2
of
the
government's
brief.
and
you
will
note
that
they
provide
for
a
punishment,
one
by
that,
if
the
kidnapped
person
has
not
been
liberated
unharmed
and
if
the
jury
shall
so
recommend.
or
two,
by
imprisonment
for
any
term
of
years
or
for
life
if
the
death
penalty
is
not
enclosed,
after
corresponding
from
that,
that
a
jury
recommendation
is
a
precondition
to
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
the
district
judge
was
of
the
further
view
that
a
jury
recommendation
of
the
death
penalty
would
be
binding
upon
him.
now,
in
that,
we
do
not
agree
with
his
conclusion
for
our
reasons
which
i
shall
develop
later.
but
first
i
propose
to
go
on,
if
i
may,
and
to
indicate
the
reasoning
to
which
this
conclusion
led
him.
his
next
step
was
to
conclude
that
the
hazard,
the
hazard
that
the
jury
might
make
such
a
binding
determination
would
tend
or
might
tend
to
induce
the
defendant
to
avoid
the
jury
trial,
either
by
seeking
to
waive
that
right
or
by
pleading
guilty
to
the
indictment.
now,
judge
timbers,
the
district
judge,
of
course
recognized
that
a
waiver
of
jury
trial
depends
upon
the
consent
of
the
government
and
the
approval
of
the
court,
and
also,
that
the
court
may
refuse
to
accept
a
guilty
plea.
he
also
recognized
that
a
number
of
federal
judges
in
cases
arising
under
this
act
and
also
in
cases
arising
under
the
somewhat
similar
provisions
feeling
with
aggravated
bank
robbery
have
in
fact
convened
a
jury
to
consider
the
circumstances
of
the
offense
and
to
make
a
recommendation
as
to
punishment
in
circumstances
where
the
court
has
allowed
a
waiver
of
jury
trial
or
accepted
the
plea
of
guilty,
in
other
words,
they
have
convened
the
jury
solely
on
the
issue
of
punishment.
and
parenthetically,
i
might
note
that
we
made
a
check
of
records
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
and
the
relevant
case
files
of
the
department
of
justice
as
to
the
number
of
death
sentences
which
were
finally
imposed
in
cases
arising
under
the
kidnapping
statute
and
under
the
similar
provisions
of
the
bank
robbery
act,
both
statutes
which
have
been
on
--
both
statutes
are
on
the
books
for
approximately
30
odd
years.
and
there
were
10
such
cases
that
we
found.
in
five
of
these
10
cases,
the
judge
had
accepted
a
guilty
plea
and
then
had
convened
a
jury
on
the
issue
of
punishment
alone.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
there
would
be
no
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
that's
a
very
limited
number
insofar
as
the
federal
scheme
is
concerned,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
is
a
somewhat
similar
statute
in
the
district
on
rape,
yes,
on
rape
(voice
overlap).
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
pardon
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i'm
adverting
to
the
case
where
there
is
no
jury
trial.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
on
the
issue
of
guilt,
whether
the
judge
in
that
circumstance,
and
that's
from
being
the
jury
(voice
overlap).
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
no.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
think
where
its
common
ground
that
there
is
no
recommendation,
the
maximum
penalty
is
imprisonment.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
then
we
have
a
question
as
to
which
there
is
a
difference
of
views
between
the
parties
as
to
whether
the
judge
is
bound
to
follow
that
recommendation.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
he
is
not.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
because
the
statute
itself
doesn't
make
it
binding
to
begin
with
that
and
that's
how
we
interpret
the
statute.
and
i
am
going
to
develop
several
reasons
why
we
think
where
the
statute
itself
is
not
compelled
either
reading
why
the
reading
which
we
urge
should
be
adopted.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
that,
if
we
are
right
in
the
way
we
read
it,
that
the
claim
that
there
is
a
substantial
disparity
of
risk
whether
you
demand
the
jury
trial
or
whether
you
seek
to
waive
it,
drops
out.
now,
before
i
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
it
does
not
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
--
one
court
that
specifically
analyzed
that
question
started
with
the
proposition
that
congress
certainly
could
not
have
intended
that
the
man
who
acknowledges
his
guilt
by
pleading
guilty
should
be
in
a
better
position
than
the
man
who
contests
his
guilt.
and
the
court
concluded
that
consistently
with
a
rational
statutory
scheme,
if
it
granted
the
request
for
a
waiver
of
jury
trial,
it
would
have
the
power
inherently
to
convene
a
jury
on
the
issue
of
punishment.
now,
the
state
courts
have
done
that
in
a
number
of
states
in
under
similar
statutes
which
make
provision
for
a
jury
recommendation
as
to
the
penalty.
there
is
no
expressed
provision
in
this
statute
for
the
convening
of
a
jury
on
the
issue
of
punishment
as
i've
indicated,
the
courts
of
appeals
which
have
considered
whether
they
have
power
to
do
that,
if
concluded
that
they
do.
the
two
cases
that
allude
to
this
and
discuss
it
to
some
extent
are
cases
called
seadlund
and
dalhover
both
of
which
of
are
cited
in
the
government's
brief.
but
there
is,
your
honor
is
quite
right,
there
is
no
explicit
statutory
provision
for
convening
a
jury
on
the
issue
of
punishment.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
where
a
jury
was
convened
on
the
issue
of
punishment?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
is
a
case
in
kentucky,
the
robinson
case
which
we
have
also
cited,
which
expresses
the
opinion
contrary
to
that
adopted
by
judge
timbers
that
a
court
would
not
be
bound
by
such
a
recommendation.
however,
that
case
arose
on
a
collateral
attack
proceeding
upon
the
theory
that
as
judge
timbers
had
said
this
whole
statute
was
unconstitutional.
so
it
was
not
a
case
in
which
the
judge
who
was
expressing
the
opinion
that
he
would
not
be
bound
was
actually
passing
upon
a
jury
recommendation.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
those
are
in
at
least
five
cases
where
a
court
accepted
a
guilty
plea.
it's
subsequently
convened
a
jury
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
did
in
five
cases
and
the
judge
acted
on
the
recommendation.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
there
were
10
cases
in
all
of
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
think
the
judge
has
accepted
it.
there
are
only
10
cases
in
all,
all
of
which
death
sentences
were
imposed.
as
i've
indicated
earlier,
in
five
of
those
cases,
a
jury
was
especially
convened
on
the
punishment
issues.
now,
i
do
not
know
of
any
case
in
which
the
jury
recommended
death
and
in
which
the
judge
did
not
follow
the
recommendation.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
in
the
federal
system?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
these
are
the
only
two
statutes
under
which
we've
had
experienced
with
under
a
provision
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
though
in
that
case,
i
don't
think
there'd
been
any
death
sentences
executed
for
something
like
20
years.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
do
--
there
are
only
three
cases
as
i
understand
it
in
the
district
of
columbia
statute
where
death
was
imposed.
and
in
all
of
three
cases
that
would
correspond
the
jury's
recommendation.
i
don't
know
that
there
was
any
other
--
at
least
i'm
not
familiar
with
any
other
instance.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
--
no,
we
make
the
same
argument
that
the
judge
accepted
in
the
robinson
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
under
this
statute,
a
fair
reading
would
permit
the
court
to
hold
and
we
think
it's
the
desirable
as
well
as
the
permissible
interpretation
that
the
judge
is
not
bound
by
the
jury
recommendation.
and
perhaps,
i
should
go
immediately
to
the
reasoning
on
which
we
suggest
that
you're
not
bound.
getting
back
to
the
statute
itself,
the
appellees
rely
upon
the
fact
that
it
uses
the
language
“shall
be
punished”.
we
think
that
that's
a
very
limited
force
because
you
will
note
that
the
language
shall
be
punished,
precedes
both
alternatives:
one,
by
death
if
the
jury
so
recommends
or;
two,
by
imprisonment
if
the
death
penalty
is
not
imposed.
and
so
it
seems
to
us
that
the
language
standing
alone
seems
only
to
compel
the
conclusion
that
he
shall
be
punished
by
one
of
the
two
alternatives.
and
of
course,
this
statute,
in
the
first
numbered
clause
is
as
if
the
verdict
of
the
jury
shall
so
recommend
and
the
normal
connotation
of
recommend
is
that
it
is
a
recommendation
and
not
a
mandate.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
its'
the
judge
who
imposes
a
sentence.
that's
certainly
true.
now,
there
are
three
additional
considerations.
i
assume
that
the
statue
is
equivocal
here
and
both
sides,
i
think
are
agreed
that
the
legislative
history
does
not
in
likeness.
there
had
been
a
variety
of
proposals
made
as
to
provisions
for
sentencing
under
this
statute.
some
have
favored
a
mandatory
death
sentence.
some
had
favored
a
provision
not
on
like
that
in
the
federal
murder
statute
that
the
penalty
shall
be
death
unless
the
jury
qualifies
its
verdict
by
recommending
otherwise.
some
have
been
opposed
to
the
death
penalty
altogether.
this
provision
of
the
penalty
might
only
be
imposed
if
recommended
by
the
jury
was
the
ultimate
compromise.
and
there
is
no
indication
that
we've
been
able
to
find
on
either
side
of
this
case
that
judge
from
the
briefs,
that
any
of
the
congressmen
focused
on
the
question,
what
if
the
judge
doesn't
agree
with
the
jury.
now,
we
rely
upon
three
considerations,
i
say,
in
support
of
our
reading.
the
first
of
these
is
that
in
the
federal
system,
it's
certainly
has
been
a
tradition,
i
think
a
well
unbroken
tradition
that
the
judge
is
the
final
arbiter
of
the
sentence.
as
justice
brennan
indicated
a
moment
ago
in
the
federal
system,
it's
the
judge
who
imposes
the
sentence.
under
the
federal
rules
it
is
the
judge
who
passes
on
any
motion
to
reduce
sentence
and
who
has
considerable
discretion
subject
only
to
the
situation
where
congress
has
explicitly
provided
some
mandatory
minimum.
and
i
think
the
congress
was
presumably
aware
of
this
tradition.
secondly,
we
refer
to
what
this
court
has
called
the
principle
or
rule
of
lenity.
namely
that
where
a
criminal
statute
is
equivocal,
the
court
will
adopt
the
less
harsh
of
two
alternatives,
and
certainly,
a
rule
which
permits
the
judge
to
mitigate
the
penalty
is
the
less
harsh
rule.
third,
we
say
that
if
the
concept
that
the
jury's
recommendation
is
mandatory
as
judge
timbers
has
concluded
creates
serious
constitutional
doubts,
then
it
would
seem
to
us
further
that
the
precept
of
the
statute
should
be
read
where
possible
to
avoid
those
doubts
comes
into
play.
now,
under
our
view
of
the
statute,
as
i
think
i
indicated
earlier,
there
is
no
significant
disparity
of
risk
or
as
we
view
it
a
serious
basis
any
longer
for
a
constitutional
claim.
if
the
defendant
goes
to
trial
before
a
jury
on
the
issue
of
guilt,
then
under
our
view,
the
concurrence
of
both
judge
and
jury
is
required
before
a
capital
penalty
can
be
imposed.
if
on
the
other
hand,
he
seeks
to
waive
jury
trial
or
plead
guilty,
the
judge
may
reject
that
proposed
waiver
or
plea,
or
if
he
accepts
it,
he
may
convene
a
jury
on
the
issue
of
punishment
as
both
federal
and
state
judges
have
in
the
past
done
in
these
or
comparable
circumstances.
so
again,
the
capital
penalty
may
be
imposed
if,
but
only
if,
jury
and
judge
concur
in
that
conclusion.
now,
it
may
be
argued
that
a
judge,
who
would
perhaps
be
inclined
to
follow
a
jury's
recommendation
of
a
death
penalty,
if
one
were
made
by
a
jury
which
heard
the
issue
of
guilt,
might
not
be
inclined
to
convene
a
jury
if
there
were
no
jury
trial
on
the
issue
of
guilt.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
judge
who
would
be
inclined
to
concur
in
a
death
verdict,
if
one
were
recommended
to
him,
would
certainly
regarded
as
his
duty
to
have
the
matter
go
to
a
jury
and
to
obtain
a
recommendation
of
which
of
course,
he
could
readily
accomplish
either
by
insisting
that
the
jury
provide
the
question
of
guilt
or
by
convening
a
jury
on
the
issue
of
punishment.
now,
let
me
also
suggest
that
if
judge
timbers
were
thought
to
be
correct
in
holding
if
he
did,
first,
that
the
jury's
recommendation
is
more
than
a
recommendation
that
it's
binding.
and
second,
that
this
creates
a
serious
disparity
of
risk.
it
still
would
not
follow
that
the
statute
must
be
struck
down
either
in
whole
or
in
part.
or
if
one
does
make
the
assumption
that
congress
intended
the
jury
to
be
the
sole
determinant
of
the
question
of
punishment
without
any
role
for
the
judge
whatever,
then
it
would
seem
to
follow
in
our
view
that
the
trial
judge
in
order
to
implement
congress'
purpose
should
either
refuse
a
plea
or
refuse
to
accept
a
proposed
waiver
of
jury
trial.
or
in
every
instance
where
he
does
accept
it,
convene
a
jury
on
the
issue
of
punishment.
that
incidentally
is
accomplished
by
statute
or
by
decision
in
some
states
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
the
rules
of
course
provide
that
you
can
only
waive
on
consent
of
the
government
and
approval
by
the
court
that
was
challenged
on
grounds
of
constitutionality.
the
challenge
was
rejected,
that
was
singer
against
united
states.
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
us
that
if
you
read
the
statute
rigorously
as
the
appellees
do
and
give
the
judge
no
power
to
mitigate,
it
doesn't
then
follow
from
that
of
the
statutes
unconstitutional
but
rather
seem
to
follow
that
the
jury
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
make
a
recommendation.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
of
course,
there
still
remains
the
question
of
a
plea
of
guilty
which
is
discretionary
with
the
judge
but
in
which
the
prosecution
does
not
play
a
role.
now,
in
making
this
point,
i
am
not
retreating
from
our
suggestion
that
the
statute
should
not
be
read
as
making
the
jury
recommendation
binding.
we
think
that
the
plausible
and
the
preferable
interpretation
to
regard
their
verdict
as
a
recommendation.
then
merely
seeking
to
point
out
that
the
appellees'
effort
to
read
these
penalty
provisions
rigorously
in
order
to
condemn
the
statute
don't
necessarily
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
statute
has
to
be
condemned
because
the
premise
that
congress
intended
the
jury
to
be
the
sole
determinant,
the
premise
of
their
argument
seems
to
point
to
the
conclusion
that
the
judge
should
have
a
jury
to
make
the
determination
as
he
can
quite
consistently
do
under
the
federal
criminal
rules.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
not
--
we
do
not
urge
that
argument
(voice
overlap)
i
would
have
difficulty
with
that
argument
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
congressional
scheme
contemplates
that
the
death
penalty
may
be
imposed
only
if
a
jury
immediately
reaches
that
conclusion.
i
don't
want
to
convey
either
that
this
is
the
case
in
which
there's
the
slightest
likelihood
that
the
united
states
attorney
would
be
seeking
the
death
penalty.
it's
quite
clear
to
me
that
he
would
not
be
and
that
he
would
not
be
making
any
plea
for
it.
it's
quite
unlikely
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
that
any
jury
would
impose
such
penalty
because
as
the
badillo
particularly
shows
the
harm
which
was
known
to
the
dictum
in
this
kidnapping
case
is
very
minor.
what
we're
dealing
here
--
we're
dealing
with
here
is
not
what
is
apt
in
fact
to
occur
in
this
particular
case
but
rather
of
course
with
a
holding
by
a
district
judge
that
the
entire
statutory
scheme
breaks
down
and
the
statutes
unconstitutional
because
of
the
penalty
provisions
which
are
written
into
the
act.
now,
there's
just
one
final
respect
in
which
i
think
the
district
judge's
decision
is
unquestionably
involved.
if
everything
i
have
said
thus
far
should
be
rejected,
and
if
you
should
conclude
that
the
provision
authorizing
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
on
recommendation
of
the
jury
is
unconstitutional
on
any
view
of
the
matter,
it
still
would
not
follow
that
the
entire
statute
should
be
held
unconstitutional
in
the
indictment
there
under
dismissed.
it
would
follow
i
think
only
that
the
clause
authorizing
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
would
go.
i
think
that
it's
hard
to
imagine
a
clearer
case
for
severability
than
this
one.
congress,
as
your
honors,
well
know
passed
the
lindbergh
law
in
1932
because
if
in
the
contrary,
we're
greatly
concerned
by
the
shocking
incidents
which
had
occurred
and
there
had
been
a
general
recognition
that
there
were
strong
if
not
imperative
reasons
for
making
interstate
kidnappings
a
federal
offense.
the
state
lines,
it
was
believed
that
it
proved
a
serious
obstacle
to
effective
investigation
and
prosecution
of
kidnappings.
now,
as
originally
enacted
in
1932,
the
maximum
penalty
under
this
statute
was
life
imprisonment.
then
two
years
later,
in
1934
there
were
some
minor
amendments
to
the
statute.
its
basic
thrust
remained
entirely
unchanged
and
that's
graphically
shown
to
the
court
i
think
by
merely
examining
the
provisions
as
they
stood
in
1932.
and
in
1934,
we've
set
them
out
in
our
reply
brief.
now,
one
of
these
changes
was
the
change
which
authorized
on
jury
recommendation,
the
imposition
of
the
capital
penalty
in
the
aggravated
kidnapping
case
that
in
which
the
victim
was
liberated
harmed.
as
i
say,
the
thrust
of
the
act
remained
quite
unchanged.
and
it
seems
to
us
almost
inconceivable
that
one
could
seriously
argue
that
this
1934
congress
had
it
in
face
with
the
choice
of
not
adding
the
provision
authorizing
the
death
penalty
in
aggravated
cases
or
of
abandoning
the
entire
act
would
have
chosen
the
latter
course.
and
as
i
say,
this
is
a
classic
case
for
severability,
the
act
stands
as
a
complete
and
an
operative
whole
with
or
without
this
authorization
of
the
death
penalty
in
the
aggravated
case.
consequently,
the
infirmity,
if
there'd
be
any,
which
we
dispute
in
the
capital
penalty
clause,
obviously
does
not
require
the
frustration
of
congress'
very
plain
and
very
resolute
purpose
to
make
interstate
kidnapping
a
federal
crime.
thank
you.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice
and
your
honors.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
taken
by
the
united
states
from
the
district
court
in
connecticut,
dismissing
a
kidnapping
indictment
returned
against
the
three
appellees
here.
an
indictment
which
alleged
among
other
things
that
the
victim
had
not
been
liberated
unharmed.
the
ground
of
the
court's
dismissal
is
that
the
penalty
provisions
of
the
kidnapping
act
operate
in
a
way
that
creates
an
inducement
to
waive
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
jury
trial.
the
district
court
analogized
this
case
to
griffin
against
california,
stating
that
the
scheme
made
the
assertion
of
the
constitutional
right
foster.
now,
the
penalty
provisions
of
the
kidnapping
act
appear
at
page
2
of
the
government's
brief.
and
you
will
note
that
they
provide
for
a
punishment,
one
by
that,
if
the
kidnapped
person
has
not
been
liberated
unharmed
and
if
the
jury
shall
so
recommend.
or
two,
by
imprisonment
for
any
term
of
years
or
for
life
if
the
death
penalty
is
not
enclosed,
after
corresponding
from
that,
that
a
jury
recommendation
is
a
precondition
to
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
the
district
judge
was
of
the
further
view
that
a
jury
recommendation
of
the
death
penalty
would
be
binding
upon
him.
now,
in
that,
we
do
not
agree
with
his
conclusion
for
our
reasons
which
i
shall
develop
later.
but
first
i
propose
to
go
on,
if
i
may,
and
to
indicate
the
reasoning
to
which
this
conclusion
led
him.
his
next
step
was
to
conclude
that
the
hazard,
the
hazard
that
the
jury
might
make
such
a
binding
determination
would
tend
or
might
tend
to
induce
the
defendant
to
avoid
the
jury
trial,
either
by
seeking
to
waive
that
right
or
by
pleading
guilty
to
the
indictment.
now,
judge
timbers,
the
district
judge,
of
course
recognized
that
a
waiver
of
jury
trial
depends
upon
the
consent
of
the
government
and
the
approval
of
the
court,
and
also,
that
the
court
may
refuse
to
accept
a
guilty
plea.
he
also
recognized
that
a
number
of
federal
judges
in
cases
arising
under
this
act
and
also
in
cases
arising
under
the
somewhat
similar
provisions
feeling
with
aggravated
bank
robbery
have
in
fact
convened
a
jury
to
consider
the
circumstances
of
the
offense
and
to
make
a
recommendation
as
to
punishment
in
circumstances
where
the
court
has
allowed
a
waiver
of
jury
trial
or
accepted
the
plea
of
guilty,
in
other
words,
they
have
convened
the
jury
solely
on
the
issue
of
punishment.
and
parenthetically,
i
might
note
that
we
made
a
check
of
records
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
and
the
relevant
case
files
of
the
department
of
justice
as
to
the
number
of
death
sentences
which
were
finally
imposed
in
cases
arising
under
the
kidnapping
statute
and
under
the
similar
provisions
of
the
bank
robbery
act,
both
statutes
which
have
been
on
--
both
statutes
are
on
the
books
for
approximately
30
odd
years.
and
there
were
10
such
cases
that
we
found.
in
five
of
these
10
cases,
the
judge
had
accepted
a
guilty
plea
and
then
had
convened
a
jury
on
the
issue
of
punishment
alone.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
there
would
be
no
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
that's
a
very
limited
number
insofar
as
the
federal
scheme
is
concerned,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
is
a
somewhat
similar
statute
in
the
district
on
rape,
yes,
on
rape
(voice
overlap).
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
pardon
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i'm
adverting
to
the
case
where
there
is
no
jury
trial.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
on
the
issue
of
guilt,
whether
the
judge
in
that
circumstance,
and
that's
from
being
the
jury
(voice
overlap).
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
no.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
think
where
its
common
ground
that
there
is
no
recommendation,
the
maximum
penalty
is
imprisonment.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
then
we
have
a
question
as
to
which
there
is
a
difference
of
views
between
the
parties
as
to
whether
the
judge
is
bound
to
follow
that
recommendation.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
he
is
not.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
because
the
statute
itself
doesn't
make
it
binding
to
begin
with
that
and
that's
how
we
interpret
the
statute.
and
i
am
going
to
develop
several
reasons
why
we
think
where
the
statute
itself
is
not
compelled
either
reading
why
the
reading
which
we
urge
should
be
adopted.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
that,
if
we
are
right
in
the
way
we
read
it,
that
the
claim
that
there
is
a
substantial
disparity
of
risk
whether
you
demand
the
jury
trial
or
whether
you
seek
to
waive
it,
drops
out.
now,
before
i
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
it
does
not
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
--
one
court
that
specifically
analyzed
that
question
started
with
the
proposition
that
congress
certainly
could
not
have
intended
that
the
man
who
acknowledges
his
guilt
by
pleading
guilty
should
be
in
a
better
position
than
the
man
who
contests
his
guilt.
and
the
court
concluded
that
consistently
with
a
rational
statutory
scheme,
if
it
granted
the
request
for
a
waiver
of
jury
trial,
it
would
have
the
power
inherently
to
convene
a
jury
on
the
issue
of
punishment.
now,
the
state
courts
have
done
that
in
a
number
of
states
in
under
similar
statutes
which
make
provision
for
a
jury
recommendation
as
to
the
penalty.
there
is
no
expressed
provision
in
this
statute
for
the
convening
of
a
jury
on
the
issue
of
punishment
as
i've
indicated,
the
courts
of
appeals
which
have
considered
whether
they
have
power
to
do
that,
if
concluded
that
they
do.
the
two
cases
that
allude
to
this
and
discuss
it
to
some
extent
are
cases
called
seadlund
and
dalhover
both
of
which
of
are
cited
in
the
government's
brief.
but
there
is,
your
honor
is
quite
right,
there
is
no
explicit
statutory
provision
for
convening
a
jury
on
the
issue
of
punishment.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
where
a
jury
was
convened
on
the
issue
of
punishment?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
is
a
case
in
kentucky,
the
robinson
case
which
we
have
also
cited,
which
expresses
the
opinion
contrary
to
that
adopted
by
judge
timbers
that
a
court
would
not
be
bound
by
such
a
recommendation.
however,
that
case
arose
on
a
collateral
attack
proceeding
upon
the
theory
that
as
judge
timbers
had
said
this
whole
statute
was
unconstitutional.
so
it
was
not
a
case
in
which
the
judge
who
was
expressing
the
opinion
that
he
would
not
be
bound
was
actually
passing
upon
a
jury
recommendation.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
those
are
in
at
least
five
cases
where
a
court
accepted
a
guilty
plea.
it's
subsequently
convened
a
jury
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
did
in
five
cases
and
the
judge
acted
on
the
recommendation.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
there
were
10
cases
in
all
of
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
think
the
judge
has
accepted
it.
there
are
only
10
cases
in
all,
all
of
which
death
sentences
were
imposed.
as
i've
indicated
earlier,
in
five
of
those
cases,
a
jury
was
especially
convened
on
the
punishment
issues.
now,
i
do
not
know
of
any
case
in
which
the
jury
recommended
death
and
in
which
the
judge
did
not
follow
the
recommendation.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
in
the
federal
system?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
these
are
the
only
two
statutes
under
which
we've
had
experienced
with
under
a
provision
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
though
in
that
case,
i
don't
think
there'd
been
any
death
sentences
executed
for
something
like
20
years.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
do
--
there
are
only
three
cases
as
i
understand
it
in
the
district
of
columbia
statute
where
death
was
imposed.
and
in
all
of
three
cases
that
would
correspond
the
jury's
recommendation.
i
don't
know
that
there
was
any
other
--
at
least
i'm
not
familiar
with
any
other
instance.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
--
no,
we
make
the
same
argument
that
the
judge
accepted
in
the
robinson
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
under
this
statute,
a
fair
reading
would
permit
the
court
to
hold
and
we
think
it's
the
desirable
as
well
as
the
permissible
interpretation
that
the
judge
is
not
bound
by
the
jury
recommendation.
and
perhaps,
i
should
go
immediately
to
the
reasoning
on
which
we
suggest
that
you're
not
bound.
getting
back
to
the
statute
itself,
the
appellees
rely
upon
the
fact
that
it
uses
the
language
“shall
be
punished”.
we
think
that
that's
a
very
limited
force
because
you
will
note
that
the
language
shall
be
punished,
precedes
both
alternatives:
one,
by
death
if
the
jury
so
recommends
or;
two,
by
imprisonment
if
the
death
penalty
is
not
imposed.
and
so
it
seems
to
us
that
the
language
standing
alone
seems
only
to
compel
the
conclusion
that
he
shall
be
punished
by
one
of
the
two
alternatives.
and
of
course,
this
statute,
in
the
first
numbered
clause
is
as
if
the
verdict
of
the
jury
shall
so
recommend
and
the
normal
connotation
of
recommend
is
that
it
is
a
recommendation
and
not
a
mandate.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
its'
the
judge
who
imposes
a
sentence.
that's
certainly
true.
now,
there
are
three
additional
considerations.
i
assume
that
the
statue
is
equivocal
here
and
both
sides,
i
think
are
agreed
that
the
legislative
history
does
not
in
likeness.
there
had
been
a
variety
of
proposals
made
as
to
provisions
for
sentencing
under
this
statute.
some
have
favored
a
mandatory
death
sentence.
some
had
favored
a
provision
not
on
like
that
in
the
federal
murder
statute
that
the
penalty
shall
be
death
unless
the
jury
qualifies
its
verdict
by
recommending
otherwise.
some
have
been
opposed
to
the
death
penalty
altogether.
this
provision
of
the
penalty
might
only
be
imposed
if
recommended
by
the
jury
was
the
ultimate
compromise.
and
there
is
no
indication
that
we've
been
able
to
find
on
either
side
of
this
case
that
judge
from
the
briefs,
that
any
of
the
congressmen
focused
on
the
question,
what
if
the
judge
doesn't
agree
with
the
jury.
now,
we
rely
upon
three
considerations,
i
say,
in
support
of
our
reading.
the
first
of
these
is
that
in
the
federal
system,
it's
certainly
has
been
a
tradition,
i
think
a
well
unbroken
tradition
that
the
judge
is
the
final
arbiter
of
the
sentence.
as
justice
brennan
indicated
a
moment
ago
in
the
federal
system,
it's
the
judge
who
imposes
the
sentence.
under
the
federal
rules
it
is
the
judge
who
passes
on
any
motion
to
reduce
sentence
and
who
has
considerable
discretion
subject
only
to
the
situation
where
congress
has
explicitly
provided
some
mandatory
minimum.
and
i
think
the
congress
was
presumably
aware
of
this
tradition.
secondly,
we
refer
to
what
this
court
has
called
the
principle
or
rule
of
lenity.
namely
that
where
a
criminal
statute
is
equivocal,
the
court
will
adopt
the
less
harsh
of
two
alternatives,
and
certainly,
a
rule
which
permits
the
judge
to
mitigate
the
penalty
is
the
less
harsh
rule.
third,
we
say
that
if
the
concept
that
the
jury's
recommendation
is
mandatory
as
judge
timbers
has
concluded
creates
serious
constitutional
doubts,
then
it
would
seem
to
us
further
that
the
precept
of
the
statute
should
be
read
where
possible
to
avoid
those
doubts
comes
into
play.
now,
under
our
view
of
the
statute,
as
i
think
i
indicated
earlier,
there
is
no
significant
disparity
of
risk
or
as
we
view
it
a
serious
basis
any
longer
for
a
constitutional
claim.
if
the
defendant
goes
to
trial
before
a
jury
on
the
issue
of
guilt,
then
under
our
view,
the
concurrence
of
both
judge
and
jury
is
required
before
a
capital
penalty
can
be
imposed.
if
on
the
other
hand,
he
seeks
to
waive
jury
trial
or
plead
guilty,
the
judge
may
reject
that
proposed
waiver
or
plea,
or
if
he
accepts
it,
he
may
convene
a
jury
on
the
issue
of
punishment
as
both
federal
and
state
judges
have
in
the
past
done
in
these
or
comparable
circumstances.
so
again,
the
capital
penalty
may
be
imposed
if,
but
only
if,
jury
and
judge
concur
in
that
conclusion.
now,
it
may
be
argued
that
a
judge,
who
would
perhaps
be
inclined
to
follow
a
jury's
recommendation
of
a
death
penalty,
if
one
were
made
by
a
jury
which
heard
the
issue
of
guilt,
might
not
be
inclined
to
convene
a
jury
if
there
were
no
jury
trial
on
the
issue
of
guilt.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
judge
who
would
be
inclined
to
concur
in
a
death
verdict,
if
one
were
recommended
to
him,
would
certainly
regarded
as
his
duty
to
have
the
matter
go
to
a
jury
and
to
obtain
a
recommendation
of
which
of
course,
he
could
readily
accomplish
either
by
insisting
that
the
jury
provide
the
question
of
guilt
or
by
convening
a
jury
on
the
issue
of
punishment.
now,
let
me
also
suggest
that
if
judge
timbers
were
thought
to
be
correct
in
holding
if
he
did,
first,
that
the
jury's
recommendation
is
more
than
a
recommendation
that
it's
binding.
and
second,
that
this
creates
a
serious
disparity
of
risk.
it
still
would
not
follow
that
the
statute
must
be
struck
down
either
in
whole
or
in
part.
or
if
one
does
make
the
assumption
that
congress
intended
the
jury
to
be
the
sole
determinant
of
the
question
of
punishment
without
any
role
for
the
judge
whatever,
then
it
would
seem
to
follow
in
our
view
that
the
trial
judge
in
order
to
implement
congress'
purpose
should
either
refuse
a
plea
or
refuse
to
accept
a
proposed
waiver
of
jury
trial.
or
in
every
instance
where
he
does
accept
it,
convene
a
jury
on
the
issue
of
punishment.
that
incidentally
is
accomplished
by
statute
or
by
decision
in
some
states
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
the
rules
of
course
provide
that
you
can
only
waive
on
consent
of
the
government
and
approval
by
the
court
that
was
challenged
on
grounds
of
constitutionality.
the
challenge
was
rejected,
that
was
singer
against
united
states.
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
us
that
if
you
read
the
statute
rigorously
as
the
appellees
do
and
give
the
judge
no
power
to
mitigate,
it
doesn't
then
follow
from
that
of
the
statutes
unconstitutional
but
rather
seem
to
follow
that
the
jury
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
make
a
recommendation.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
of
course,
there
still
remains
the
question
of
a
plea
of
guilty
which
is
discretionary
with
the
judge
but
in
which
the
prosecution
does
not
play
a
role.
now,
in
making
this
point,
i
am
not
retreating
from
our
suggestion
that
the
statute
should
not
be
read
as
making
the
jury
recommendation
binding.
we
think
that
the
plausible
and
the
preferable
interpretation
to
regard
their
verdict
as
a
recommendation.
then
merely
seeking
to
point
out
that
the
appellees'
effort
to
read
these
penalty
provisions
rigorously
in
order
to
condemn
the
statute
don't
necessarily
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
statute
has
to
be
condemned
because
the
premise
that
congress
intended
the
jury
to
be
the
sole
determinant,
the
premise
of
their
argument
seems
to
point
to
the
conclusion
that
the
judge
should
have
a
jury
to
make
the
determination
as
he
can
quite
consistently
do
under
the
federal
criminal
rules.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
not
--
we
do
not
urge
that
argument
(voice
overlap)
i
would
have
difficulty
with
that
argument
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
congressional
scheme
contemplates
that
the
death
penalty
may
be
imposed
only
if
a
jury
immediately
reaches
that
conclusion.
i
don't
want
to
convey
either
that
this
is
the
case
in
which
there's
the
slightest
likelihood
that
the
united
states
attorney
would
be
seeking
the
death
penalty.
it's
quite
clear
to
me
that
he
would
not
be
and
that
he
would
not
be
making
any
plea
for
it.
it's
quite
unlikely
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
that
any
jury
would
impose
such
penalty
because
as
the
badillo
particularly
shows
the
harm
which
was
known
to
the
dictum
in
this
kidnapping
case
is
very
minor.
what
we're
dealing
here
--
we're
dealing
with
here
is
not
what
is
apt
in
fact
to
occur
in
this
particular
case
but
rather
of
course
with
a
holding
by
a
district
judge
that
the
entire
statutory
scheme
breaks
down
and
the
statutes
unconstitutional
because
of
the
penalty
provisions
which
are
written
into
the
act.
now,
there's
just
one
final
respect
in
which
i
think
the
district
judge's
decision
is
unquestionably
involved.
if
everything
i
have
said
thus
far
should
be
rejected,
and
if
you
should
conclude
that
the
provision
authorizing
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
on
recommendation
of
the
jury
is
unconstitutional
on
any
view
of
the
matter,
it
still
would
not
follow
that
the
entire
statute
should
be
held
unconstitutional
in
the
indictment
there
under
dismissed.
it
would
follow
i
think
only
that
the
clause
authorizing
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
would
go.
i
think
that
it's
hard
to
imagine
a
clearer
case
for
severability
than
this
one.
congress,
as
your
honors,
well
know
passed
the
lindbergh
law
in
1932
because
if
in
the
contrary,
we're
greatly
concerned
by
the
shocking
incidents
which
had
occurred
and
there
had
been
a
general
recognition
that
there
were
strong
if
not
imperative
reasons
for
making
interstate
kidnappings
a
federal
offense.
the
state
lines,
it
was
believed
that
it
proved
a
serious
obstacle
to
effective
investigation
and
prosecution
of
kidnappings.
now,
as
originally
enacted
in
1932,
the
maximum
penalty
under
this
statute
was
life
imprisonment.
then
two
years
later,
in
1934
there
were
some
minor
amendments
to
the
statute.
its
basic
thrust
remained
entirely
unchanged
and
that's
graphically
shown
to
the
court
i
think
by
merely
examining
the
provisions
as
they
stood
in
1932.
and
in
1934,
we've
set
them
out
in
our
reply
brief.
now,
one
of
these
changes
was
the
change
which
authorized
on
jury
recommendation,
the
imposition
of
the
capital
penalty
in
the
aggravated
kidnapping
case
that
in
which
the
victim
was
liberated
harmed.
as
i
say,
the
thrust
of
the
act
remained
quite
unchanged.
and
it
seems
to
us
almost
inconceivable
that
one
could
seriously
argue
that
this
1934
congress
had
it
in
face
with
the
choice
of
not
adding
the
provision
authorizing
the
death
penalty
in
aggravated
cases
or
of
abandoning
the
entire
act
would
have
chosen
the
latter
course.
and
as
i
say,
this
is
a
classic
case
for
severability,
the
act
stands
as
a
complete
and
an
operative
whole
with
or
without
this
authorization
of
the
death
penalty
in
the
aggravated
case.
consequently,
the
infirmity,
if
there'd
be
any,
which
we
dispute
in
the
capital
penalty
clause,
obviously
does
not
require
the
frustration
of
congress'
very
plain
and
very
resolute
purpose
to
make
interstate
kidnapping
a
federal
crime.
thank
you.
