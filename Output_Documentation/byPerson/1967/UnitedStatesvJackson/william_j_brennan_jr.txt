justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
in
the
district
though,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
this
true
of
some
statutes
in
the
district?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
also
true
do
you
think
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
true
in
the
district
that
even
if
a
jury
on
a
rape
conviction
was
not
to
make
a
recommendation
and
therefore
death
ordinarily
will
follow
but
the
judge
nevertheless
may
impose
life.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
none
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i'm
anticipating
you.
the
other
question
hereto
is,
the
district
of
columbia
rape
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
there
also
a
question
here
of
what
happens
in
the
circumstance
where
the
jury
does
in
fact
make
no
recommendations?
is
there
a
question
whether
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right
and
suppose
it
does
make
a
recommendation
of
death
because
that's
what
i'm
going
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
and
the
government's
position
that
he
is
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
take
it
as
--
if
you're
right
in
the
way
you
read
it,
there's
not
a
constitutional
question
here
at
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
going
beyond
that
mr.
spritzer,
any
of
those
cases
where
there's
been
a
plea
and
then
a
jury
has
been
convened
on
the
issue
of
punishment,
had
there
been
death
sentences
recommended
which
recommendations
have
been
rejected
by
sentencing
judges?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
your
footnote
to
that
court,
supposed
convening
of
juries
after
guilty
pleas.
and
at
least
five
cases,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
in
any
of
those
--
in
any
of
those
cases,
do
we
know
whether
the
jury
recommended
death
and
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
instance
of
a
rejection
on
the
jury
recommendation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
have
you
have
any
experience
either
statistically
or
considered
by
any
federal
court
of
a
jury
recommendation
of
death
in
any
case
where
the
judge
rejected
the
jury
recommendation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
have
any
experience
of
that
of
any
kind
in
the
federal
system?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
have
we
ever
had
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
has
been
experienced
under
the
district
rape
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
do
we
know
of
any
experience
of
--
when
there
was
a
recommendation
of
the
death
sentence
that
the
judge
rejected
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
supposed,
it's
not
imposed
the
last
words
of
this
section
suggest
imposition
by
the
judge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
am
i
right
mr.
spritzer
on
waiver
of
jury
trial?
didn't
we
have
a
case
(inaudible)
which
indicates
that
over
the
opposition
of
the
government,
it
may
not
be
accepted
of
guilty
plea
anyway?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
in
the
hands
of
the
prosecution
if
i
guess
it
would
be.
they
compel
him
to
go
to
a
jury
trial,
that's
the
role
of
it,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
duke,
i
suppose
the
government
is
correct
or
in
any
event,
suppose
it
is
the
fact,
that
notwithstanding
a
jury
recommendation
of
death,
the
judge
has
discretion
to
reject
the
recommendation.
would
you
still
make
this
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you'll
still
raise
the
constitutional
question
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
as
long
as
he
has
discretion
to
accept
the
recommendation,
the
constitutional
question
doesn't
get
here,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
follow
the
recommendation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
that
one
--
i
notice
the
word
ignoble.
suppose
that's
what
the
prosecutor
does
--
do
because
he
thinks
this
is
the
kind
of
the
case
where
indeed
the
death
penalty
authorized
by
law
is
appropriate.
what
makes
it
ignoble
because
he
insists
on
a
jury
trial
if
that's
the
only
way
he
can
get
death
penalty?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh!
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
exactly
the
way
it
works
in
new
jersey.
the
only
plea
of
guilty
in
a
capital
case
is
one
in
which
the
judge
accepts
the
plea
with
a
lesser
offense
which
carries
a
maximum
of
life
or
30
years
and
there
may
be
no
waiver
and
there's
maybe
no
trial
by
the
judge
to
capital
cases.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
may
not
enter
a
non
volt
to
a
capital
offense.
you
can
get
a
lesser
plea
which
carries
--
which
then
carry
with
it
30
and
in
certain
instances
life.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
