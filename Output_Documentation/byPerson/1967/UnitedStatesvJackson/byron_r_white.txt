is
this
what
had
happened
just
in
any
criminal
case
or
is
this
under
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
under
all
of
the
statutes
that
provides
for
jury
provision
in
the
sense.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
can
take
it,
you
would
say
the
same
thing
about
a
plea
of
guilty,
do
you
think
i
will
go
to
the
judge
and
i'm
the
defendant,
i
say
to
the
judge,
i
want
to
plead
guilty.
and
the
reason
i
want
to
plead
guilty
is
i
don't
want
to
face
that
jury.
you
would
think
just
like
the
waiver,
the
jury
trial,
the
plea
of
guilty
is
tainted.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
the
remedy
then
on
every
case,
just
like
we
do
in
a
lot
of
other
cases
where
there
had
been
an
invalid
plea
of
guilty
say
the
you
haven't
been
properly
instructed
or
something.
we
did
reverse
the
conviction
and
say
that
the
plea
of
guilty
was
invalid.
you're
saying
that
he
has
that
--
well,
i'm
not
saying,
i'm
suggesting
that
the
plea
of
guilty
is
invalid
and
it
doesn't
invalidate
the
statute
at
all
(voice
overlap)
plea
of
guilty.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
infirmity
of
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
infirmity
is
and
the
only
infirmity
is
that
apparently,
is
that
it
enforces
people
to
go
to
the
trial.
and
your
argument
must
be
you
have
a
constitutional
right
to
plead
guilty.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
congress
here
have
said
and
added
another
paragraph
and
said
that
there
shall
--
no
pleas
of
guilty
shall
be
accepted
in
kidnapping
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
know
that
we've
already
know
that
you
may
not
waive
a
jury
trial
over
the
objections
of
the
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
answer
on
the
latter
part
of
that
is,
yes,
the
government
could
provide
for
the
waivers
of
jury
trial.
and
i
would
think
it
could
provide
also
for
no
pleas
of
guilty.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
there
are
some
statements
that
have
--
let's
say
that
in
capital
cases
where
the
death
penalty
may
be
imposed,
only
the
jury
may
hear
it
and
there
shall
be
no
pleas
of
guilty
accepted
and
no
waivers
of
jury
trial.
