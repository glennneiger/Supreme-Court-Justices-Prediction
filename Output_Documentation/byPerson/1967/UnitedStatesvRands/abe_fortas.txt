justice

fortas
aren't
there
two
possible
constructions
in
the
term
port
site
on
that
it's
a
port
site
without
reference
to
what
the
united
states
did
to
the
stream
and
two,
that
it's
a
port
site
in
terms
of
the
u.s.
development
of
the
stream
and
which
you
are
talking
about
here.
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
understand
that
but
the
value
that
it
had
as
a
historic
landing
might
be
considerably
less
than
its
value
as
a
port
site
after
the
u.s.
development.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
what
is
it
theoretically
and
conceptually?
let
us
say
if
you
assume
that
the
respondent
is
entitled
to
compensation
for
the
port
site
value,
are
we
talking
about
the
port
site
value
before
or
after
the
improvement?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
that?
i
thought
--
if
that
is
so,
why
wouldn't
it
be
after
the
john
dam
improvement
period,
bonneville
and
the
others
were
improvements
by
the
united
states.
justice
abe
fortas
was
that
the
rule
of
law?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
abe
fortas
that
you
do
pay
thinking
of
counting
the
incremental
value
from
government
projects
except
for
the
one
that
led
to
the
taking?
justice
abe
fortas
but
i'm
not
sure
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
have
wharves
and
docks
at
this
port
site
before
flooding?
justice
abe
fortas
was
it
developed
at
all?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
was
it
developed
at
all
as
a
port?
were
there
any
structures
which
were
used
as
port
facilities?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
had
there
been
historically?
justice
abe
fortas
and
how
long
ago
had
they
existed?
justice
abe
fortas
but
suppose
that
the
--
beginning
of
a
century,
you'd
have
--
or
assume
we
have
assumed
that
after
this
technology
permitted,
it
had
on
this
land
a
wheel
that
forgives
the
electric
power.
and
suppose
the
government
took
that
for
this
purpose,
would
the
government
have
to
pay
me
for
the
value
as
a
site
for
water
power?
justice
abe
fortas
but
for
--
what's
the
difference?
i
think
that's
a
problem
here.
what
is
the
difference
between
that
and
the
--
this
parti
--
in
this
case
that
we
haven't
before
us
now?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
can
be
argued
both
ways.
justice
abe
fortas
unfortunately.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
that
your
answer
to
me
that
you
distinguish
between
the
established
doctrines
to
distinguish
where
the
established
doctrine
about
non-compensability
of
power
sites,
hydroelectric
power
sites.
and
your
claim
here
on
the
grounds
that
one
is
that
there
has
been
a
departure
from
historic
doctrine
in
the
case
of
power
sites.
is
that
your
total
answer
to
me?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
--
it
seem
to
be
a
fortiori
but
where
a
riparian
right
such
as
the
port
site
where
riparian
right
such
as
port
site
is
taken
over.
since
it
does
have
an
intimate
relation
to
the
navigability
of
the
stream
it
seems
largely
that
the
federal
government
could
take
it
without
compensation.
what's
your
answer
to
that?
justice
abe
fortas
aren't
