mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involving
the
condemnation
of
respondent's
land
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
raises
an
aspect
of
the
recurring
problem
of
the
relationship
of
the
property
rights
of
riparian
landowners
to
the
power
of
the
federal
government
over
navigation
and
navigable
waters.
in
particular,
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
when
the
united
states
condemns
riparian
land
for
use
in
a
river
improvement
project
it
must
pay
the
owner
not
only
for
the
land's
value
as
upland,
but
also
for
such
incremental
value
as
the
land
may
have
as
a
site
for
a
port.
respondents
owned
two
tracks
of
undeveloped
land
containing
a
total
of
approximately
260
acres
lying
along
the
oregon
shore
of
the
columbia
river
some
250
miles
up
from
the
pacific.
it
was
taken
in
connection
with
the
john
day
lock
and
dam;
a
project
authorized
by
congress
in
1950
as
part
of
a
comprehensive
program
for
the
development
of
the
columbia
river
and
distributaries.
the
john
day
dam
is
a
multipurpose
project
designed
for
flood
control,
hydroelectric
power,
and
navigation.
and
i
think
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
here
that
the
project
serves
a
bona
fide
navigational
purpose.
when
completed,
the
dam
will
create
a
lake
of
some
75
miles
which
will
fill
an
important
missing
link
between
the
lakes
created
downstream
and
upstream
by
prior
dam
projects.
it
does
complete
a
slack
water
navigational
passage
running
hundreds
of
miles
from
the
pacific
coast
into
the
interiors,
all
the
way
to
idaho.
it
was
estimated
in
1950
that
the
gain
to
the
economy
from
the
dam's
navigational
function
alone
exceeded
in
$1,948
dollars,
a
million
and
three
quarter
--
one
and
three
quarter
million
dollars
per
year.
the
creation
of
the
lake
which
will
be
approximately
100
feet
deep
at
the
dam
site
inevitably
involves
a
degree
of
flooding
of
uplands
because
respondent's
tracks
are
within
the
area
to
be
flooded.
the
united
states
commence
this
condemnation
proceeding
in
1963.
the
sole
question
litigated
below
was
the
amount
that
the
united
states
must
pay
for
the
property
taken.
although
respondents
sought
to
raise
other
issues
both
courts
below
held
that
they
had
not
done
so
in
a
timely
fashion.
and
that
aspect
of
the
case
has
not
been
brought
before
this
court.
we
do
not
have
here
therefore
any
challenge
to
the
validity
of
the
taking
as
it
proper
exercise
of
the
government's
powers
of
eminent
domain,
nor
any
question
as
to
the
use
that
may
subsequently
be
made
of
the
land
taken.
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
compensation,
respondents
indicated
before
trial,
they
would
seek
to
prove
that
most
of
the
land
was
useful
for
agriculture
and
for
the
extraction
of
gravel
and
sand.
but
that
a
small
portion
of
the
land
had
a
higher
value
because
of
its
utility
as
a
port
site.
the
reasons
which
i
will
return
to
in
a
moment,
the
district
court
excluded
all
evidence
of
port
site
value.
a
jury
awarded
some
$7,000
for
one
fact
on
the
basis
of
agricultural
and
mineral
uses.
and
the
party
stipulated
that
$2,400
was
appropriate
compensation
for
the
other
track.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
there
was
an
offer
of
proof
after
the
district
judge's
ruling.
and
there
is
an
affidavit
of
a
sea
captain,
river
captain
who
says
i
think
that
a
--
not
less
than
$50,000
would
be
appropriate
for
the
port
site.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it's
a
--
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
it's
not
entirely
clear
but
both
facts
weren't
litigated
but
i
think
it's
something
like
30
acres.
there
is
evidence
or
there
is
an
offer
of
evidence
that
historically
there
was
a
landing
of
a
sort
not
developed
but
simply
a
place
where
a
boat
could
pull
up
alongside
the
shoreline.
and
the
water
was
deep
there.
the
district
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
combined
judgment
covering
both
tracks
of
260
acres
is
$9,000.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
$9,000
somewhat.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it
has
subsequently
been
sold
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it
has
subsequently
been
sold
together
with
several
thousand
other
acres
to
the
state
of
oregon
by
the
united
states,
the
united
states
reserving
an
easement
to
flow
so
that
this
land
can
be
underwater
as
far
as
the
federal
government
is
concerned.
the
state
of
oregon
has
some
interest
in
developing
the
whole
area
as
an
industrial
park,
i
believe
for
the
boeing
corporation.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
there
is
this
evidence
--
this
offer
would
have
to
be
tested
and
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
an
offer
made
in
light
of
the
government's
project
already
underfoot.
but
there
was
a
negotiation
between
the
state
of
oregon
and
respondents
and
an
agreement
between
them
which
was
--
for
an
option
to
purchase
this
land.
at
which
time,
the
state
of
oregon
i
believe,
agreed
to
an
option
price
for
purchase
of
$400
per
acre
for
the
port
site
part
of
the
land.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
something
like
30
maybe
50
acres,
something
like
that.
i'm
sorry
i
can't
be
more
precise
about
what
is
actually
the
port
site
but
the
evidence
is
quite
incomplete.
the
district
court's
decision
that
the
respondents
are
not
entitled
to
compensation
for
the
land's
utility
as
a
port
site
was
based
on
the
premise
that
such
utility
was
entirely
dependent
of
the
land's
location
on
and
access
to
a
navigable
river.
and
that
such
use
was
therefore
subject
to
the
historic
servitude
or
power
of
the
federal
government
over
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
in
this
respect,
the
district
court
believed
correctly
we
submit
that
it
was
bound
by
this
court's
decisions
in
united
states
v.
twin
city
and
united
states
v.
virginia
electric
power.
those
cases
both
held
that
when
the
united
states
takes
land
--
riparian
to
a
navigable
stream,
it
need
not
pay
compensation
for
so
much
of
the
value
of
that
land
as
may
be
attributable
to
power
site
value.
the
district
court
found
that
it
could
not
distinguish
between
power
site
value
and
port
site
value.
it
pointed
out
that
both
involved
the
exploitation
of
the
navigable
stream
and
both
can't
be
operated
without
the
navigable
stream.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
we
were
willing
to
--
we
were
willing
and
more
or
less
to
agree
that
anything
they
said
was
a
port
site.
we
just
said
we
didn't
have
to
pay
for
the
port
site
value
in
anything.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
let
me
be
--do
you
think
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
i'm
not
clear.
it
--
i'd
like
to
make
it
clear
that
my
respondent's
land
is
completely
underwater
or
will
be
very
shortly
so
that
it
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
potentially
--
yes
sir.
potentially
it's
a
port
site
only
in
the
sense
that
the
state
of
oregon
may
sink
piles
in
the
mud.
if
there's
going
to
be
a
port
in
the
future
there,
it
isn't
the
port
that
the
rands
owned
or
thought
they
owned.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
this
and
the
several
thousands
or
2,000
other
acres
were
to
be
developed
for
industrial
and
port
purposes.
i
don't
know
exactly
what
that
means
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
land
is
underwater.
i
assume
it
means
that
oregon
ought
to
dredge
it
and
put
up
buoys
or
put
up
down
piles
for
piers.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
it
had
so
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
right,
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
suppose
what
the
united
states
is
stating
to
oregon
is,
that
you
use
this
entire
track
on
the
portion
of
which
is
going
to
be
underwater,
as
a
port
site
to
the
extent
that
it
can
be
utilized
as
a
port
site.
the
portion
that's
underwater
is
utilized
as
a
port
site
only
to
the
extent
that
it
supports
piles.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
absolutely,
i
gather
that's
a
very
--
the
substantial
reason
for
having.
we're
here
concerned
with
two
constitutional
provisions,
the
commerce
clause
which
has
long
been
held
to
include
the
power
in
the
united
states
to
control
navigation,
and
the
waters
on
which
navigation
is
conducted.
and
the
fifth
amendments
command
that
private
property
not
be
taken
without
just
compensation.
i
think
i
might
mention
first
the
perfectly
familiar
proposition
that
while
the
fifth
amendment
undertakes
to
redistribute
to
the
public,
certain
economic
losses
inflicted
by
public
improvements,
it
surely
does
not
redistribute
all
such
losses.
it
redistributes
only
those
which
result
from
uptaking
of
private
property.
and
not
all
economic
interests
have
been
regarded
traditionally
as
private
property
or
indeed
it's
a
property.
and
not
all
loses
of
value
result
from
takings.
the
respondents
undeniably
had
a
valuable
economic
interest
in
the
utility
of
their
land
as
a
port
site.
we
don't
deny
that
in
transactions
between
private
individuals,
they
might
or
might
not
have
realized
some
value
for
that
utility.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
i
take
it
and
there
i
think
in
fairness
their
offer
of
proof
indicates
that
it
had
historically
been
used
as
a
landing
before
any
(voice
overlap)
acts
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that's
right.
no
one
ever
reached
the
point
of
determining
how
much
of
the
port
site
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
by
traditional
rules
they
were
--
it
was
the
port
site
value
before
the
john
day
project.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
but
after
sec
--
projects
that
could
be
regarded
as
separate
by
bonneville,
grand
coulee,
whatever
else
we
might
bear
on.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
my
understanding
is
that
to
take
it
out
of
the
navigational
context,
the
government
doesn't
pay
enhancement
resulting
from
the
very
project
of
these
--
for
the
taking.
but
it
does
pay
such
enhancement
as
it
results
from
other
activities
the
federal
government
has
engaged
in.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--
this
court
has
decided
that.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
this
court
has
so
held
in
a
fair
number
of
cases.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
it
would
--
it
lead
to
impossibility
if
you
didn't
say
that
because
you'd
think
--
begin
to
worry
about
the
value
of
having
the
military.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
don't
think
that's
the
question
that
any
court
here
has
reached
nor
that
this
court
has
to
reach
now.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
don't
think
it
shows
anything
in
very
mathematical
terms.
the
affidavit
submitted
is
an
offer
of
proofs
by
the
captain,
indicated
that
he
had
been
bringing
grain
and
lumber
back
and
forth.
and
undoubtedly,
we
would
certainly
concede
that
at
least
since
the
federal
government
started
working
on
the
columbia
river,
the
amount
of
commerce
has
increased
very
substantially.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it
is
at
some
points
how
busy
it
is
at
this
particular
juncture
where
navigation
has
been
so
much
more
difficult
than
lower
down.
i
don't
know.
perhaps
you
know
better
than
i.
now
we
submit
that
a
port
site
in
the
sense
that
respondents
use
it
in
the
sense
that
it's
just
not
the
water
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
stepping
stone
into
the
water,
the
inter-navigable
water.
its
value
is
precisely
the
value
of
access
to
and
the
use
of
an
artery
of
commerce.
that
right
of
access
and
use
as
we
recognize
among
the
bundle
of
rights
that
have
been
traditionally
protected
under
state
law
as
riparian
rights.
but
like
all
other
riparian
rights
access
and
use
is
a
qualified
right,
qualified
traditionally
by
the
compatible
interest
of
other
riparian
owners.
and
it
is
also
clear
that
on
a
navigable
stream,
riparian
rights
are
subject
to
the
paramount
qualification
that
has
been
termed
the
federal
government's
navigational
servitude.
that
is
to
say
that
the
exercise
of
its
powers
under
the
commerce
clause,
congress
may
authorize
projects
which
will
impair
or
utterly
destroy
riparian
rights
as
recognized
by
the
state
law
on
navigable
waters
without
compensation.
that
proposition
is
established
by
decisions
of
this
court
going
back
more
than
a
century.
and
i
don't
think
it
is
seriously
open
to
dispute
today
where
that
respondent's
dispute
it.
it
is
based,
we
believe,
on
the
very
wise
perception.
but
the
great
navigable
waterways
of
a
nation,
waterways
down
which
flow
the
commerce
of
the
nation.
waterways
which
were
of
critical
importance
to
opening
up
the
continent
and
waterways
on
which
we
just
currently
spend
something
like
a
billion
dollars
a
year
to
perfect
and
improve
that
those
waterways
are
national
assets.
as
the
court
said
in
gilman
v.
philadelphia
and
3
wall,
for
purposes
of
commerce,
the
navigable
waters
are
the
public
property
of
the
nation.
under
these
circumstances
to
require
the
united
states
to
pay
for
riparian
rights
destroyed
through
river
harbor
improvements
would
be
to
create
private
planes
in
the
public
domain
as
this
court
said
in
twin
city.
in
some,
vis-à-vis
the
united
states,
riparian
owners
enjoy
no
private
right
to
exploit
navigable
waters
for
which
they
must
be
compensated
under
the
fifth
amendment.
now
to
be
sure
in
the
present
case,
there's
a
taking
of
fast
land.
that
is
land
above
the
high
water
mark
of
the
river.
for
the
val
--
land's
value
as
upland,
we
concededly
must
pay
just
compensation
but
we
deny
that
the
united
states
must
pay
for
the
privilege
previously
enjoyed,
the
special
advantage
previously
enjoyed
by
respondents
abusing
a
public
waterway.
i
think
there
is
an
analogy
here
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
united
states
v.
powelson,
where
the
court
rejected
the
contention
that
the
landowner's
privilege
to
use
the
power
of
eminent
domain
under
a
state
grand
enhance
the
value
of
the
condemned
property
because
it
created
a
possibility
of
uniting
it
with
other
tracks.
the
court
said
that
the
landowner's
privileged
there
was
not
private
property
as
contemplated
by
the
fifth
amendment.
and
that
an
award
based
on
that
privilege,
on
that
advantage,
would
be
an
appropriation
of
public
authority
to
a
holy
private
end.
precisely
here,
we
think
that
the
advantage
of
using
that
water,
water
which
is
--
belongs
to
the
public
is
not
the
sort
of
economic
interest
for
which
the
public
has
to
pay
when
it
wants
to
improve
that
waterway.
now
even
more
in
point
of
course,
other
courts
relatively
recent
positions
in
twin
city
and
virginia
electric.
in
both
cases,
the
court
held
that
the
landowners
were
not
entitled
to
compensation
with
the
power
site
value
of
their
lands.
mr.
justice
stewart
wrote
for
the
court
in
virginia
electric,
“just
as
the
navigational
privilege
permits
the
government
to
reduce
the
value
of
riparian
lands
by
denying
the
riparian
owner
access
to
the
stream
without
compensation.
it
also
permits
the
government
to
disregard
the
value
arising
from
the
same
fact
of
riparian
location
in
compensating
the
owner
when
fast
lands
are
taken”.
that
i
believe
is
precisely
our
case.
now
to
distinguish
the
power
site
cases,
respondents
urge
the
congress
has
established
a
much
more
rigorous
system
of
regulation
of
power
sites
under
the
federal
power
act
than
--
over
port
sites
under
the
rivers
and
harbors
act.
but
the
type
of
regulation
that
has
been
found
desirable
on
either
subject
can
tell
us
nothing
about
what
is
permissible
under
the
commerce
clause
or
required
under
the
fifth
amendment.
the
fact
that
congress
has
found
a
more
relaxed
mode
of
regulation
but
not
a
missing
mode
of
regulation
appropriate
for
ports
and
harbors,
doesn't
tell
you
that
that
exhaust
their
authority.
and
it
certainly
doesn't
tell
you
the
full
scope
of
the
government's
navigational
servitude.
there's
also
a
suggestion
which
may
have
been
shared
by
the
court
below
that
because
this
court
has
always
spoken
of
the
flow
of
the
stream
as
that
in
which
there
is
no
private
interest,
it
referred
only
to
moving
water
and
ports
don't
require
moving
water
although
power
sites
do.
but
i
think
that
that
must
be
fanciful.
i
just
can't
see
--
no
one
has
been
able
to
explain
how
any
constitutional
doctrine
can
depend
on
the
rapidity
with
which
the
water
moves.
there
has
never
been
a
suggestion
by
this
court
that
the
federal
government's
interest
is
limited
to
the
motion
of
the
water
as
opposed
to
the
water
itself
in
whatever
state
it
may
be.
there
is
also
a
suggestion
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
and
i
would
suppose
there
has
to
be
a
navigational
purpose
or
at
least
some
purpose
within
the
ambit
of
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
rules
as
i
understand
it
are
that
until
the
corps
of
engineers
establishes
a
harbor
line,
you
have
to
get
permission
to
build
anything.
now,
i
suspect
that
small
scale
that's
honored
in
the
bridge
but
in
theory
at
least
until
a
harbor
line
is
drawn,
you've
got
to
get
approval
from
the
corp
of
engineers.
once
a
harbor
line
is
drawn,
you
can
build
up
to
the
harbor
line
and
not
beyond
and
you
have
to
get
permission
to
do
anything
other
than
that.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
unquestionably.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
tomorrow
the
corps
of
engineers
could
decide
with
the
interest
of
navigation
required
making
the
oregon
side
of
the
stream
the
navigable
channel
and
that
all
appears
must
be
on
the
washington
side
of
the
stream.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
absolutely
not.
indeed
as
justice
black
wrote
for
the
court,
there
is
no
right
to
fish
in
the
stream
if
the
federal
government
has
a
valid
basis
for
excluding
you
from
the
stream.
indeed,
not
withstanding
the
attempts
to
distinguish
the
power
site
cases,
we
think
that
if
any
distinction
between
the
two
situations
is
to
be
recognized,
it
surely
must
be
that
historically
and
logically,
port
sites
are
more
obviously
embraced
by
a
navigational
servitude
than
power
sites.
river
and
postal
traffic
was
one
of
the
original
and
principal
concerns
of
the
commerce
clause.
until
this
century,
waterpower
was
at
most
a
relatively
peripheral
matter.
indeed
federal
hydroelectric
projects
have
generally
been
justified
as
ancillary
to
some
navigational
purpose.
and
while
power
projects
can
utilize
both
navigation
--
navigable
and
non-navigable
waters,
of
course,
navigability
and
navigable
waters
is
the
very
essence
of
a
port's
utility.
we
submit
that
that
government's
position
here
is
not
to
be
distinguished
from
the
power
site
cases
but
rather
follows
a
fortiori
from
them.
and
in
conclusion,
we
urge
that
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
require
the
public
to
pay
for
terminating
the
special
advantage
previously
enjoyed
by
respondents
in
this
artery
of
commerce.
we
urge
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
be
reversed
and
that
of
the
district
court
reinstated.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
mr.
chief
justice,
please
the
court.
perhaps
i
might
start
with
the
two
statutory
questions
that
have
come
up.
mr.
justice
white
was
concerned
and
probably
so
about
the
statutory
authority
under
which
the
condemnation
preceding
--
proceeded
section
591
of
title
33
says
that
the
secretary
of
the
army
may
proceed
to
condemn
land
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
condemnation.
it
says
nothing
about
any
particular
standard
evaluation
and
it
as
far
as
i
know,
always
been
assumed
that
that
was
a
reference
to
the
constitutional
standard
of
just
compensation.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
law
of
condemnation.
it
doesn't
refer
you
to
title
such
and
such.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
there
are
provisions
for
expediting
the
taking
and
so
on.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
as
far
as
i
know
at
the
moment,
they
all
simply
referred
to
the
constitutional
standard
or
have
always
been
assumed
to
refer
to
that
standard.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
there's
nothing
like
that
as
far
as
i
know
just
compensation.
in
that
respect,
it
differs
somewhat
from
the
federal
power
act
which
does
provide
a
standard
for
recapture
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
all
i
can
say.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
all
the
twin
city
dealt
with.
it's
all
that
the
court
of
appeals
dealt
with
as
far
as
i
can
say.
the
other
statutory
aspect
is
the
submerged
lands
act.
and
i
think
that
can
be
dealt
with
briefly.
not
only
did
the
submerged
lands
act
reserve
were
not
include
in
its
grant
to
the
states
or
its
confirmation
to
the
states
waterpower,
it
expressly
reserve
to
the
united
states
all
its
navigable
servitude.
that
is
the
only
thing
i
think
of
the
whole
legislative
history
that
tells
you
anything
about
it.
and
so
i
assume
that
that
language
brings
with
it
all
the
traditional
language
about
what
that
navigable
servitude
includes.
i
think
it
confuses
things
to
suggest
that
there's
some
inconsistency
because
the
submerged
lands
act
was
after
all
concerned
with
fee
titles
to
subsoil
underwater.
we're
not
concerned
with
the
fee
title
to
anything.
we
don't
claim
that
the
united
states
owns
the
title
of
the
lands
underwater,
never
have.
not
since
pollard
and
hagan
at
least.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
states
owned
that
title
and
--
or
that
they
are
grantees
on
it.
but
that
has
always
been
thought
consistent
with
the
servitude
of
the
united
states
for
purposes
of
navigation.
finally,
let
me
turn
briefly
to
the
chandler-dunbar
case.
undoubtedly
that
is
one
of
the
cases
on
which
the
two
power
site
cases
depend.
it
is
true
that
in
that
case,
a
grant
--
a
compensation
was
allowed
for
a
piece
of
land
that
had
utility
as
the
potential
site
for
a
canal.
i
think
three
things
can
be
said
about
that
aspect
of
chandler-dunbar
because
after
all
the
principal
thrust
of
that
case
is
that
the
united
states
doesn't
have
to
pay
for
power
site
value.
the
three
things
are
all
said
in
twin
city
in
a
footnote.
they
are
--
perhaps
the
court
there
thought
that
that
was
consistent
with
the
navigable
uses
of
the
government.
perhaps
the
case
ought
to
be
limited
to
its
facts.
and
in
any
event,
these
were
uses
of
the
water
--
only
the
indirect
sense
that
they
provided
a
place
where
you
could
take
boats
away
from
the
river,
and
away
from
the
rapids.
in
that
sense,
it
wasn't
a
use
of
the
river.
in
the
sense
of
a
port
site
or
a
power
site,
it
was
a
substitute
for
the
river.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involving
the
condemnation
of
respondent's
land
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
raises
an
aspect
of
the
recurring
problem
of
the
relationship
of
the
property
rights
of
riparian
landowners
to
the
power
of
the
federal
government
over
navigation
and
navigable
waters.
in
particular,
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
when
the
united
states
condemns
riparian
land
for
use
in
a
river
improvement
project
it
must
pay
the
owner
not
only
for
the
land's
value
as
upland,
but
also
for
such
incremental
value
as
the
land
may
have
as
a
site
for
a
port.
respondents
owned
two
tracks
of
undeveloped
land
containing
a
total
of
approximately
260
acres
lying
along
the
oregon
shore
of
the
columbia
river
some
250
miles
up
from
the
pacific.
it
was
taken
in
connection
with
the
john
day
lock
and
dam;
a
project
authorized
by
congress
in
1950
as
part
of
a
comprehensive
program
for
the
development
of
the
columbia
river
and
distributaries.
the
john
day
dam
is
a
multipurpose
project
designed
for
flood
control,
hydroelectric
power,
and
navigation.
and
i
think
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
here
that
the
project
serves
a
bona
fide
navigational
purpose.
when
completed,
the
dam
will
create
a
lake
of
some
75
miles
which
will
fill
an
important
missing
link
between
the
lakes
created
downstream
and
upstream
by
prior
dam
projects.
it
does
complete
a
slack
water
navigational
passage
running
hundreds
of
miles
from
the
pacific
coast
into
the
interiors,
all
the
way
to
idaho.
it
was
estimated
in
1950
that
the
gain
to
the
economy
from
the
dam's
navigational
function
alone
exceeded
in
$1,948
dollars,
a
million
and
three
quarter
--
one
and
three
quarter
million
dollars
per
year.
the
creation
of
the
lake
which
will
be
approximately
100
feet
deep
at
the
dam
site
inevitably
involves
a
degree
of
flooding
of
uplands
because
respondent's
tracks
are
within
the
area
to
be
flooded.
the
united
states
commence
this
condemnation
proceeding
in
1963.
the
sole
question
litigated
below
was
the
amount
that
the
united
states
must
pay
for
the
property
taken.
although
respondents
sought
to
raise
other
issues
both
courts
below
held
that
they
had
not
done
so
in
a
timely
fashion.
and
that
aspect
of
the
case
has
not
been
brought
before
this
court.
we
do
not
have
here
therefore
any
challenge
to
the
validity
of
the
taking
as
it
proper
exercise
of
the
government's
powers
of
eminent
domain,
nor
any
question
as
to
the
use
that
may
subsequently
be
made
of
the
land
taken.
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
compensation,
respondents
indicated
before
trial,
they
would
seek
to
prove
that
most
of
the
land
was
useful
for
agriculture
and
for
the
extraction
of
gravel
and
sand.
but
that
a
small
portion
of
the
land
had
a
higher
value
because
of
its
utility
as
a
port
site.
the
reasons
which
i
will
return
to
in
a
moment,
the
district
court
excluded
all
evidence
of
port
site
value.
a
jury
awarded
some
$7,000
for
one
fact
on
the
basis
of
agricultural
and
mineral
uses.
and
the
party
stipulated
that
$2,400
was
appropriate
compensation
for
the
other
track.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
there
was
an
offer
of
proof
after
the
district
judge's
ruling.
and
there
is
an
affidavit
of
a
sea
captain,
river
captain
who
says
i
think
that
a
--
not
less
than
$50,000
would
be
appropriate
for
the
port
site.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it's
a
--
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
it's
not
entirely
clear
but
both
facts
weren't
litigated
but
i
think
it's
something
like
30
acres.
there
is
evidence
or
there
is
an
offer
of
evidence
that
historically
there
was
a
landing
of
a
sort
not
developed
but
simply
a
place
where
a
boat
could
pull
up
alongside
the
shoreline.
and
the
water
was
deep
there.
the
district
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
combined
judgment
covering
both
tracks
of
260
acres
is
$9,000.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
$9,000
somewhat.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it
has
subsequently
been
sold
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it
has
subsequently
been
sold
together
with
several
thousand
other
acres
to
the
state
of
oregon
by
the
united
states,
the
united
states
reserving
an
easement
to
flow
so
that
this
land
can
be
underwater
as
far
as
the
federal
government
is
concerned.
the
state
of
oregon
has
some
interest
in
developing
the
whole
area
as
an
industrial
park,
i
believe
for
the
boeing
corporation.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
there
is
this
evidence
--
this
offer
would
have
to
be
tested
and
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
an
offer
made
in
light
of
the
government's
project
already
underfoot.
but
there
was
a
negotiation
between
the
state
of
oregon
and
respondents
and
an
agreement
between
them
which
was
--
for
an
option
to
purchase
this
land.
at
which
time,
the
state
of
oregon
i
believe,
agreed
to
an
option
price
for
purchase
of
$400
per
acre
for
the
port
site
part
of
the
land.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
something
like
30
maybe
50
acres,
something
like
that.
i'm
sorry
i
can't
be
more
precise
about
what
is
actually
the
port
site
but
the
evidence
is
quite
incomplete.
the
district
court's
decision
that
the
respondents
are
not
entitled
to
compensation
for
the
land's
utility
as
a
port
site
was
based
on
the
premise
that
such
utility
was
entirely
dependent
of
the
land's
location
on
and
access
to
a
navigable
river.
and
that
such
use
was
therefore
subject
to
the
historic
servitude
or
power
of
the
federal
government
over
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
in
this
respect,
the
district
court
believed
correctly
we
submit
that
it
was
bound
by
this
court's
decisions
in
united
states
v.
twin
city
and
united
states
v.
virginia
electric
power.
those
cases
both
held
that
when
the
united
states
takes
land
--
riparian
to
a
navigable
stream,
it
need
not
pay
compensation
for
so
much
of
the
value
of
that
land
as
may
be
attributable
to
power
site
value.
the
district
court
found
that
it
could
not
distinguish
between
power
site
value
and
port
site
value.
it
pointed
out
that
both
involved
the
exploitation
of
the
navigable
stream
and
both
can't
be
operated
without
the
navigable
stream.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
we
were
willing
to
--
we
were
willing
and
more
or
less
to
agree
that
anything
they
said
was
a
port
site.
we
just
said
we
didn't
have
to
pay
for
the
port
site
value
in
anything.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
let
me
be
--do
you
think
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
i'm
not
clear.
it
--
i'd
like
to
make
it
clear
that
my
respondent's
land
is
completely
underwater
or
will
be
very
shortly
so
that
it
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
potentially
--
yes
sir.
potentially
it's
a
port
site
only
in
the
sense
that
the
state
of
oregon
may
sink
piles
in
the
mud.
if
there's
going
to
be
a
port
in
the
future
there,
it
isn't
the
port
that
the
rands
owned
or
thought
they
owned.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
this
and
the
several
thousands
or
2,000
other
acres
were
to
be
developed
for
industrial
and
port
purposes.
i
don't
know
exactly
what
that
means
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
land
is
underwater.
i
assume
it
means
that
oregon
ought
to
dredge
it
and
put
up
buoys
or
put
up
down
piles
for
piers.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
it
had
so
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
right,
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
suppose
what
the
united
states
is
stating
to
oregon
is,
that
you
use
this
entire
track
on
the
portion
of
which
is
going
to
be
underwater,
as
a
port
site
to
the
extent
that
it
can
be
utilized
as
a
port
site.
the
portion
that's
underwater
is
utilized
as
a
port
site
only
to
the
extent
that
it
supports
piles.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
absolutely,
i
gather
that's
a
very
--
the
substantial
reason
for
having.
we're
here
concerned
with
two
constitutional
provisions,
the
commerce
clause
which
has
long
been
held
to
include
the
power
in
the
united
states
to
control
navigation,
and
the
waters
on
which
navigation
is
conducted.
and
the
fifth
amendments
command
that
private
property
not
be
taken
without
just
compensation.
i
think
i
might
mention
first
the
perfectly
familiar
proposition
that
while
the
fifth
amendment
undertakes
to
redistribute
to
the
public,
certain
economic
losses
inflicted
by
public
improvements,
it
surely
does
not
redistribute
all
such
losses.
it
redistributes
only
those
which
result
from
uptaking
of
private
property.
and
not
all
economic
interests
have
been
regarded
traditionally
as
private
property
or
indeed
it's
a
property.
and
not
all
loses
of
value
result
from
takings.
the
respondents
undeniably
had
a
valuable
economic
interest
in
the
utility
of
their
land
as
a
port
site.
we
don't
deny
that
in
transactions
between
private
individuals,
they
might
or
might
not
have
realized
some
value
for
that
utility.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
i
take
it
and
there
i
think
in
fairness
their
offer
of
proof
indicates
that
it
had
historically
been
used
as
a
landing
before
any
(voice
overlap)
acts
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that's
right.
no
one
ever
reached
the
point
of
determining
how
much
of
the
port
site
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
by
traditional
rules
they
were
--
it
was
the
port
site
value
before
the
john
day
project.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
but
after
sec
--
projects
that
could
be
regarded
as
separate
by
bonneville,
grand
coulee,
whatever
else
we
might
bear
on.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
my
understanding
is
that
to
take
it
out
of
the
navigational
context,
the
government
doesn't
pay
enhancement
resulting
from
the
very
project
of
these
--
for
the
taking.
but
it
does
pay
such
enhancement
as
it
results
from
other
activities
the
federal
government
has
engaged
in.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--
this
court
has
decided
that.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
this
court
has
so
held
in
a
fair
number
of
cases.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
it
would
--
it
lead
to
impossibility
if
you
didn't
say
that
because
you'd
think
--
begin
to
worry
about
the
value
of
having
the
military.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
don't
think
that's
the
question
that
any
court
here
has
reached
nor
that
this
court
has
to
reach
now.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
don't
think
it
shows
anything
in
very
mathematical
terms.
the
affidavit
submitted
is
an
offer
of
proofs
by
the
captain,
indicated
that
he
had
been
bringing
grain
and
lumber
back
and
forth.
and
undoubtedly,
we
would
certainly
concede
that
at
least
since
the
federal
government
started
working
on
the
columbia
river,
the
amount
of
commerce
has
increased
very
substantially.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it
is
at
some
points
how
busy
it
is
at
this
particular
juncture
where
navigation
has
been
so
much
more
difficult
than
lower
down.
i
don't
know.
perhaps
you
know
better
than
i.
now
we
submit
that
a
port
site
in
the
sense
that
respondents
use
it
in
the
sense
that
it's
just
not
the
water
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
stepping
stone
into
the
water,
the
inter-navigable
water.
its
value
is
precisely
the
value
of
access
to
and
the
use
of
an
artery
of
commerce.
that
right
of
access
and
use
as
we
recognize
among
the
bundle
of
rights
that
have
been
traditionally
protected
under
state
law
as
riparian
rights.
but
like
all
other
riparian
rights
access
and
use
is
a
qualified
right,
qualified
traditionally
by
the
compatible
interest
of
other
riparian
owners.
and
it
is
also
clear
that
on
a
navigable
stream,
riparian
rights
are
subject
to
the
paramount
qualification
that
has
been
termed
the
federal
government's
navigational
servitude.
that
is
to
say
that
the
exercise
of
its
powers
under
the
commerce
clause,
congress
may
authorize
projects
which
will
impair
or
utterly
destroy
riparian
rights
as
recognized
by
the
state
law
on
navigable
waters
without
compensation.
that
proposition
is
established
by
decisions
of
this
court
going
back
more
than
a
century.
and
i
don't
think
it
is
seriously
open
to
dispute
today
where
that
respondent's
dispute
it.
it
is
based,
we
believe,
on
the
very
wise
perception.
but
the
great
navigable
waterways
of
a
nation,
waterways
down
which
flow
the
commerce
of
the
nation.
waterways
which
were
of
critical
importance
to
opening
up
the
continent
and
waterways
on
which
we
just
currently
spend
something
like
a
billion
dollars
a
year
to
perfect
and
improve
that
those
waterways
are
national
assets.
as
the
court
said
in
gilman
v.
philadelphia
and
3
wall,
for
purposes
of
commerce,
the
navigable
waters
are
the
public
property
of
the
nation.
under
these
circumstances
to
require
the
united
states
to
pay
for
riparian
rights
destroyed
through
river
harbor
improvements
would
be
to
create
private
planes
in
the
public
domain
as
this
court
said
in
twin
city.
in
some,
vis-à-vis
the
united
states,
riparian
owners
enjoy
no
private
right
to
exploit
navigable
waters
for
which
they
must
be
compensated
under
the
fifth
amendment.
now
to
be
sure
in
the
present
case,
there's
a
taking
of
fast
land.
that
is
land
above
the
high
water
mark
of
the
river.
for
the
val
--
land's
value
as
upland,
we
concededly
must
pay
just
compensation
but
we
deny
that
the
united
states
must
pay
for
the
privilege
previously
enjoyed,
the
special
advantage
previously
enjoyed
by
respondents
abusing
a
public
waterway.
i
think
there
is
an
analogy
here
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
united
states
v.
powelson,
where
the
court
rejected
the
contention
that
the
landowner's
privilege
to
use
the
power
of
eminent
domain
under
a
state
grand
enhance
the
value
of
the
condemned
property
because
it
created
a
possibility
of
uniting
it
with
other
tracks.
the
court
said
that
the
landowner's
privileged
there
was
not
private
property
as
contemplated
by
the
fifth
amendment.
and
that
an
award
based
on
that
privilege,
on
that
advantage,
would
be
an
appropriation
of
public
authority
to
a
holy
private
end.
precisely
here,
we
think
that
the
advantage
of
using
that
water,
water
which
is
--
belongs
to
the
public
is
not
the
sort
of
economic
interest
for
which
the
public
has
to
pay
when
it
wants
to
improve
that
waterway.
now
even
more
in
point
of
course,
other
courts
relatively
recent
positions
in
twin
city
and
virginia
electric.
in
both
cases,
the
court
held
that
the
landowners
were
not
entitled
to
compensation
with
the
power
site
value
of
their
lands.
mr.
justice
stewart
wrote
for
the
court
in
virginia
electric,
“just
as
the
navigational
privilege
permits
the
government
to
reduce
the
value
of
riparian
lands
by
denying
the
riparian
owner
access
to
the
stream
without
compensation.
it
also
permits
the
government
to
disregard
the
value
arising
from
the
same
fact
of
riparian
location
in
compensating
the
owner
when
fast
lands
are
taken”.
that
i
believe
is
precisely
our
case.
now
to
distinguish
the
power
site
cases,
respondents
urge
the
congress
has
established
a
much
more
rigorous
system
of
regulation
of
power
sites
under
the
federal
power
act
than
--
over
port
sites
under
the
rivers
and
harbors
act.
but
the
type
of
regulation
that
has
been
found
desirable
on
either
subject
can
tell
us
nothing
about
what
is
permissible
under
the
commerce
clause
or
required
under
the
fifth
amendment.
the
fact
that
congress
has
found
a
more
relaxed
mode
of
regulation
but
not
a
missing
mode
of
regulation
appropriate
for
ports
and
harbors,
doesn't
tell
you
that
that
exhaust
their
authority.
and
it
certainly
doesn't
tell
you
the
full
scope
of
the
government's
navigational
servitude.
there's
also
a
suggestion
which
may
have
been
shared
by
the
court
below
that
because
this
court
has
always
spoken
of
the
flow
of
the
stream
as
that
in
which
there
is
no
private
interest,
it
referred
only
to
moving
water
and
ports
don't
require
moving
water
although
power
sites
do.
but
i
think
that
that
must
be
fanciful.
i
just
can't
see
--
no
one
has
been
able
to
explain
how
any
constitutional
doctrine
can
depend
on
the
rapidity
with
which
the
water
moves.
there
has
never
been
a
suggestion
by
this
court
that
the
federal
government's
interest
is
limited
to
the
motion
of
the
water
as
opposed
to
the
water
itself
in
whatever
state
it
may
be.
there
is
also
a
suggestion
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
and
i
would
suppose
there
has
to
be
a
navigational
purpose
or
at
least
some
purpose
within
the
ambit
of
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
rules
as
i
understand
it
are
that
until
the
corps
of
engineers
establishes
a
harbor
line,
you
have
to
get
permission
to
build
anything.
now,
i
suspect
that
small
scale
that's
honored
in
the
bridge
but
in
theory
at
least
until
a
harbor
line
is
drawn,
you've
got
to
get
approval
from
the
corp
of
engineers.
once
a
harbor
line
is
drawn,
you
can
build
up
to
the
harbor
line
and
not
beyond
and
you
have
to
get
permission
to
do
anything
other
than
that.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
unquestionably.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
tomorrow
the
corps
of
engineers
could
decide
with
the
interest
of
navigation
required
making
the
oregon
side
of
the
stream
the
navigable
channel
and
that
all
appears
must
be
on
the
washington
side
of
the
stream.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
absolutely
not.
indeed
as
justice
black
wrote
for
the
court,
there
is
no
right
to
fish
in
the
stream
if
the
federal
government
has
a
valid
basis
for
excluding
you
from
the
stream.
indeed,
not
withstanding
the
attempts
to
distinguish
the
power
site
cases,
we
think
that
if
any
distinction
between
the
two
situations
is
to
be
recognized,
it
surely
must
be
that
historically
and
logically,
port
sites
are
more
obviously
embraced
by
a
navigational
servitude
than
power
sites.
river
and
postal
traffic
was
one
of
the
original
and
principal
concerns
of
the
commerce
clause.
until
this
century,
waterpower
was
at
most
a
relatively
peripheral
matter.
indeed
federal
hydroelectric
projects
have
generally
been
justified
as
ancillary
to
some
navigational
purpose.
and
while
power
projects
can
utilize
both
navigation
--
navigable
and
non-navigable
waters,
of
course,
navigability
and
navigable
waters
is
the
very
essence
of
a
port's
utility.
we
submit
that
that
government's
position
here
is
not
to
be
distinguished
from
the
power
site
cases
but
rather
follows
a
fortiori
from
them.
and
in
conclusion,
we
urge
that
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
require
the
public
to
pay
for
terminating
the
special
advantage
previously
enjoyed
by
respondents
in
this
artery
of
commerce.
we
urge
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
be
reversed
and
that
of
the
district
court
reinstated.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
mr.
chief
justice,
please
the
court.
perhaps
i
might
start
with
the
two
statutory
questions
that
have
come
up.
mr.
justice
white
was
concerned
and
probably
so
about
the
statutory
authority
under
which
the
condemnation
preceding
--
proceeded
section
591
of
title
33
says
that
the
secretary
of
the
army
may
proceed
to
condemn
land
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
condemnation.
it
says
nothing
about
any
particular
standard
evaluation
and
it
as
far
as
i
know,
always
been
assumed
that
that
was
a
reference
to
the
constitutional
standard
of
just
compensation.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
law
of
condemnation.
it
doesn't
refer
you
to
title
such
and
such.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
there
are
provisions
for
expediting
the
taking
and
so
on.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
as
far
as
i
know
at
the
moment,
they
all
simply
referred
to
the
constitutional
standard
or
have
always
been
assumed
to
refer
to
that
standard.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
there's
nothing
like
that
as
far
as
i
know
just
compensation.
in
that
respect,
it
differs
somewhat
from
the
federal
power
act
which
does
provide
a
standard
for
recapture
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
all
i
can
say.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
all
the
twin
city
dealt
with.
it's
all
that
the
court
of
appeals
dealt
with
as
far
as
i
can
say.
the
other
statutory
aspect
is
the
submerged
lands
act.
and
i
think
that
can
be
dealt
with
briefly.
not
only
did
the
submerged
lands
act
reserve
were
not
include
in
its
grant
to
the
states
or
its
confirmation
to
the
states
waterpower,
it
expressly
reserve
to
the
united
states
all
its
navigable
servitude.
that
is
the
only
thing
i
think
of
the
whole
legislative
history
that
tells
you
anything
about
it.
and
so
i
assume
that
that
language
brings
with
it
all
the
traditional
language
about
what
that
navigable
servitude
includes.
i
think
it
confuses
things
to
suggest
that
there's
some
inconsistency
because
the
submerged
lands
act
was
after
all
concerned
with
fee
titles
to
subsoil
underwater.
we're
not
concerned
with
the
fee
title
to
anything.
we
don't
claim
that
the
united
states
owns
the
title
of
the
lands
underwater,
never
have.
not
since
pollard
and
hagan
at
least.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
states
owned
that
title
and
--
or
that
they
are
grantees
on
it.
but
that
has
always
been
thought
consistent
with
the
servitude
of
the
united
states
for
purposes
of
navigation.
finally,
let
me
turn
briefly
to
the
chandler-dunbar
case.
undoubtedly
that
is
one
of
the
cases
on
which
the
two
power
site
cases
depend.
it
is
true
that
in
that
case,
a
grant
--
a
compensation
was
allowed
for
a
piece
of
land
that
had
utility
as
the
potential
site
for
a
canal.
i
think
three
things
can
be
said
about
that
aspect
of
chandler-dunbar
because
after
all
the
principal
thrust
of
that
case
is
that
the
united
states
doesn't
have
to
pay
for
power
site
value.
the
three
things
are
all
said
in
twin
city
in
a
footnote.
they
are
--
perhaps
the
court
there
thought
that
that
was
consistent
with
the
navigable
uses
of
the
government.
perhaps
the
case
ought
to
be
limited
to
its
facts.
and
in
any
event,
these
were
uses
of
the
water
--
only
the
indirect
sense
that
they
provided
a
place
where
you
could
take
boats
away
from
the
river,
and
away
from
the
rapids.
in
that
sense,
it
wasn't
a
use
of
the
river.
in
the
sense
of
a
port
site
or
a
power
site,
it
was
a
substitute
for
the
river.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
