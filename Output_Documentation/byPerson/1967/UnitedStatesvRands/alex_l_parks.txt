mr.
alex
l.
parks
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
submit
that
in
this
particular
case
the
government
position
--
government's
position
ignores
the
basic
distinction
between
ownership
on
the
one
hand
and
control
on
the
other.
we
freely
concede
the
government's
undoubted
power
of
absolute
control
over
navigation
and
all
the
incidents
of
navigation.
we're
not
therefore
concerned
with
such
situations
as
occasion
which
the
build
--
the
government
itself
may
build
docks
and
wharves
in
front
of
the
riparian
owner's
property
and
thereby
cutoff
his
access.
this
was
the
situation
in
gibson
versus
united
states
and
scranton
versus
wheeler.
we're
not
concerned
about
the
government
moving
back
the
harbor
line
as
it
is
done
in
one
instance
in
the
past,
and
sustained
by
this
court
in
greenleaf
versus
--
greenleaf
johnson
lumber
company.
we're
not
concerned
about
the
government
dredging
up
materials
into
passing
them
in
front
of
our
lands.
this
is
the
commodore
(inaudible).
we're
not
concerned
about
the
value
of
the
uplands
because
of
the
value
in
the
flow
a
stream.
that
is
in
the
movement
of
the
water
passed
the
riparian
owner's
properties.
this
was
a
situation
in
chandler-dunbar,
in
twin
city,
and
also
in
virginia
power.
what
we
really
are
concerned
about
is,
can
the
value
of
land
taken
under
the
power
of
eminent
domain
and
that's
how
the
government
proceeded
in
this
case.
can
it
be
ignored
because
of
its
riparian
location
rather
than
perhaps
increased
in
value
as
one
would
logically
assume
would
be
the
case.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
oh,
yes
of
course
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
i
think
this
necessarily
follows,
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
--mr.
justice
white.
and
in
connection
with
your
question
of
counsel
a
moment
ago,
i
think
i
should
clarify
that
the
value
of
this
land
is
depended
upon
its
value
at
the
time
of
taking.
and
the
time
of
taking
of
course
is
prior
to
the
completion
of
john
day
dam.
and
therefore
its
value
and
its
natural
state
prior
to
the
elevation
of
the
pool
level.we
of
course
could
claim
no
incremental
value
nor
would
we
in
the
event
the
land
were
valued
after
the
dam
had
been
built
if
this
is
conceivable.
this
in
essence
was
a
situation
in
the
river
rouge
improvement
case.
there,
the
court
sent
back
the
case
to
the
lower
court
because
of
improper
constructions
by
the
lower
court
relative
to
the
value
to
be
deducted
because
of
the
existence
of
the
government's
improvement.
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
rely
very
heavily
on
river
rouge
as
well
as
chandler-dunbar
in
connection
with
our
claim
that
we're
entitled
to
compensation
as
a
port
site.
our
lands
were
for
practical
purposes
of
little
value
except
as
a
port
site.
it's
what
is
commonly
known
in
oregon
as
jackrabbit
land.
it
was
certainly
with
very
little
as
grazing
land.
historically
this
particular
location,
this
site
was
the
old
castle
rock
landing
at
which
turn
wheelers
and
barges
landed
and
discharged
various
cargos,
wool,
oil
and
wheat.
now
clearly
the
state
of
oregon
regarded
these
lands
as
being
of
considerable
value
as
a
port
site
because
they
sought
an
auction
from
the
owner
for
$400
an
acre
for
use
as
a
port
site.
keep
in
mind
that
at
this
time
the
state
of
oregon
desperately
had
to
have
this
waterfront
land
in
order
to
complete
its
boeing
space
age
park,
is
what
they
called
it.
this
was
a
concept
by
the
state
of
oregon
in
which
they
exchanged
and
purchased
lands
for
the
united
states
to
create
a
large
missile
testing
site
which
then
they
in
turn
at
least
devoid.
by
contrast
of
course
under
the
award,
the
value
received
by
the
owner
was
approximately
according
to
the
government's
brief
of
$36
and
not
calculated
at
20.
nonetheless,
as
if
to
add
insult
to
injury,
the
government
condemned.
they
refused
to
pay
1
cent
for
the
port
site
value.
they
immediately
turned
around
and
conveyed
the
lands
to
the
state
of
oregon.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
it
was
condemned
on
the
rivers
and
harbors
act.
there's
no
question
about
it
being
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
its
fair
market
value,
yes
sir.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
substantial.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
no
question
about
it
your
honor.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
it's
arguing
that
it
can
take
it
in
not
pay
one
cent
for
the
value
as
a
port
site.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
apparently
not
if
they
give
it
away.
only
if
they
take
it.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
that
is
correct.
and
generally
speaking
in
term
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
we
contend
it
did
not.
fair
market
value
has
been
construed
by
enumerable
cases
both
by
these
courts
--
by
this
court
and
all
the
courts
in
this
country
as
being
its
highest
and
best
use.
unquestionably
the
highest
and
best
use
of
this
particular
land
was
as
a
port
site.
it
certainly
was
worth
very
little,
it
was
grazing
land.
now
and
the
government
condemned,
refused
to
pay
a
cent,
conveyed
the
lands
to
the
state
of
oregon
for
the
express
purpose
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
i'm
very
sorry.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
after
having
received
the
conveyance,
the
state
of
oregon
then
in
turn
lease
the
lands
to
the
boeing
company.
and
both
conveyance
is
subject
to
port
site
was
discussed.
and
the
government's
quitclaim
deed,
they
recognized
that
these
lands
were
valuable
as
port
site
and
industrial
lands.
and
obviously,
the
only
ones
who
have
--
which
were
of
any
considerable
value
as
a
port
site
would
be
those
in
front
of
the
water
after
the
elevation
of
the
pool.
i
might
also
comment
on
--
for
whatever
bearing
it
may
have
on
the
facts
that
not
all
of
the
respondent's
lands
are
being
emendated.
it's
true
that
the
pool
elevation
does
bring
the
water
level
up
and
cover
part
of
the
lands
but
not
all
of
the
lands.
most
important
is
we
view
the
matter,
it
doesn't
require
the
completion
of
john
day
dam
to
render
these
particular
port
site
lands
valuable
as
port
sites.
the
water
depth
in
the
columbia
river
even
before
john
day
was
authorized
were
some
15
feet
directly
in
front
of
these
properties,
and
was
thus
more
than,
equipped
with
barge
transportation
with
or
without
john
day
dam.
i
might
say
that
hadn't
this
had
not
been
the
case.
and
i
think
it
rather
doubtful
that
we
would
have
been
entitled
to
any
compensation
at
all
these
port
site
lands.
it
has
to
be
the
state
of
the
lands
prior
to
the
governmental
improvement
not
afterwards.
and
it
also
has
to
be
whether
or
not
they
were
valuable
as
a
port
site
at
the
time
of
taking.
we
rely
of
course
most
heavily
on
the
chandler-dunbar,
which
of
course
was
the
case
that
was
primarily
the
basis
for
the
united
states
versus
twin
city.
and
twin
city
and
virginia
power
of
course,
are
the
two
cases
upon
which
the
government
most
heavily
relies.
it
will
be
noted
that
in
chandler-dunbar
which
primarily
concerned
hydroelectric
site
development,
there
was
no
award
given
for
lack
in
canal
purposes.
there
was
also
an
award
given
without
any
argument,
any
contention
on
the
part
of
the
government
for
wharves
and
docks.
and
that's
the
same
situation
we
have
here,
we
call
it
a
port
site.
it's
valuable
as
a
port
site
only
because
of
the
right
to
wharf
out.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
we
did
not
at
the
time
of
taking,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
it
had
been
used
historically
and
there
was
a
whole
landing
there
at
one
time.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
not
at
the
time
of
taking.
no
sir.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
yes
sir.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
around
the
turn
of
a
century,
as
near
as
we
can
tell.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
yes,
they
--
they've
secured
an
option
from
us
only
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
sir?
mr.
alex
l.
parks
well,
it
--
roughly
around
that
figure.
it
was
$400
an
acre
for
a
certain
number
of
acres.
interestingly
enough,
the
state's
option
was
on
a
lease
which
they
got
from
us
for
$1
a
year.
and
then
after
they
found
that
they
were
going
to
have
the
federal
government
condemn
them
instead
of
pay
for
it,
they
turned
around
and
held
the
land
under
the
terms
of
the
tenure
leased.
it's
a
very
interesting
proposition.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
sir?
mr.
alex
l.
parks
approximately
for
this
section,
$20
an
acre,
essentially
what
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
somewhere
around
there
sir.
but
you
see
there
was
a
lot
more
land
involved
in
the
conveyance
so
it's
a
little
difficult
to
segregate
the
two
transfers.
now,
in
this
connection
that
is
with
respect
to
wharves
and
docks
and
the
chandler-dunbar
cases,
this
court
said,
these
two
parcels
seemed
to
have
been
connected
by
a
costly
fill.
they
front
it
upon
deep
water
above
the
head
of
the
rapids.
they
have
therefore
a
special
value
for
wharves
and
docks
and
so
forth,
and
have
been
so
used.
the
gross
sum
awarded
included
the
following
elements.
(a)
for
general
wharfage,
dock
and
warehouse
purposes
disconnecting
with
the
development
of
power
in
the
rapids.
subsequently,
this
court
have
self-noted
in
twin
city
that
chandler-dunbar
gave
compensation
for
canals
and
locks.
the
court
stated
in
part
in
a
footnote,
it
may
be
that
the
court
was
influenced
by
the
fact
that
on
a
special
fact
of
the
case,
the
use
of
the
land
for
canals
and
locks
was
only
consistent
for
the
dominant
navigational
servitude
of
the
united
states
and
indeed
they
aided
navigation.
the
court
could
just
as
easily
have
used
the
term
wharves
and
docks
as
these
two
usually
were
held
compensable
in
chandler
versus
dunbar.
and
of
course,
chandler-dunbar
was
expressly
stated
in
the
twin
city
case
as
the
case
which
controls
twin
city.
it's
never
been
overruled,
nor
until
this
case
arose,
has
the
correctness
for
the
payment
of
compensation
for
wharves
and
docks
ever
been
questioned.
this
is
the
first
time
the
question
has
ever
risen.
as
a
collateral
matter,
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
we
think
that
river
rouge
is
also
directly
applicable
because
this
is
the
case
that
arose
under
33
u.s.c.
(a)
--
595,
which
provides
that
in
ascertaining
the
value
of
properties,
you
shall
not
take
into
consideration
any
increment
of
value
by
reason
of
the
government's
improvement.
in
that
particular
case,
they
--
there
were
some
confusion
over
what
are
riparian
rights?
what
do
they
mean?
are
they
rights
of
substantial
value?
this
court
held
that
the
instructions
of
the
trial
court
to
the
jury
on
this
question
did
not
sufficiently
emphasize
the
historical
value
of
riparian
rights
and
therefore
that
the
jury
undoubtedly
did
not
deduct
enough
from
the
award
relative
to
the
increment
in
value
by
reason
of
the
improvement.
now
it
seems
impossible
to
us
to
acquaint
the
result
in
river
rouge
with
the
contention
now
being
made
by
the
government.
if
any
increment
in
value
due
to
the
waterway
improvement
must
be
deducted,
how
can
it
logically
be
argued
that
it's
fair
and
proper
to
disregard
the
initial
value
which
existed
long
prior
to
the
development?
in
fact,
it's
rather
interesting
that
the
lower
court's
instruction
in
the
river
rouge
case
is
essentially
what
the
government
is
contending
today.
when
river
rouge
was
being
argued
before
this
court,
i
would
--
the
government
took
just
the
opposite
position.
now
it's
true
as
the
counsel
pointed
out
that
we
contend
that
there's
no
dependency
here
on
the
floor
of
the
stream.
mr.
justice
white,
you
pointed
out
correctly
so
sir
that
the
presence
of
water
is
absolutely
necessary,
or
else
you
don't
have
a
port
site.
however,
hydroelectric
site
that
is
a
wholly
dependent
upon
the
flow
of
the
stream,
in
this
case
no
such
dependency
exists.
as
results
have
pointed
out
in
twin
city
was
respect
to
the
court's
reasoning
in
chandler-dunbar,
the
use
of
respondent's
port
site
lands
is
wholly
consistent
with
the
dominant
navigational
servitude
of
the
government
and
in
fact
would
actually
aid
navigation.
a
hydroelectric
power
site
to
be
of
value
requires
the
dam
across
the
entire
reach
of
the
stream.
and
thus,
in
a
sense,
is
inimical
to
navigation
unless
locks
are
installed
in
the
dam.
port
site
value
exist
however
particularly
in
this
case
whether
or
not
a
dam
has
ever
constructed.
hydroelectric
power
site
value
is
relatively
new
in
concept,
it
having
come
into
existence
chiefly
in
the
last
50
to
75
years.
on
the
other
hand,
port
site
values
date
back
to
the
inception
of
english
jurisprudence
and
have
always
been
recognized
as
valuable
riparian
rights.
we
further
contend
the
congress
has
in
the
submerged
lands
act
indicated
a
national
policy
to
protect
and
preserve
the
property
rights
of
the
states
and
their
grantees
in
submerged
imminent
waters.
it
will
indeed
be
anomalous
to
preserve
such
rights
in
submerged
lands
and
deny
those
same
rights
with
respect
to
upland
properties.our
stating
at
another
fashion,
the
submerged
lands
act
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
ownership
of
riparian
lands
is
vested
in
the
states
and
their
grantees,
control
of
the
navigation
remains
in
the
federal
government.
in
this
case
having
elected
to
proceed
by
the
condemnation
route,
the
government
is
obliged
to
pay
just
compensation.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
no
sir.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
i
think
the
essential
difference
is
--
differences
i
should
say,
plural
or
two.
one
is
that
historically,
riparian
property
rights
have
always
been
recognized
as
valuable
property
rights;
the
right
of
access,
the
right
of
fishery,
the
right
of
--
in
and
over
the
land
between
high
and
low
watermark.
this
concept
has
never
changed
at
least
until
this
case
arose.
but
more
important,
the
development
of
hydroelectric
power
is
not
an
aid
of
navigation.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
navigability
of
the
stream.
it's
a
by-product
as
it
were
of
the
flow
of
the
stream.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
unfortunately
i
can't.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
at
first
blush,
it
might
seem
rather
unusual
that
the
submerged
lands
act
would
deem
to
apply
to
this
case
at
all.
it's
true
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
no
sir,
i
would
hope
not.
its
--
may
i
phrase
it
in
the
converse?
that
again
to
reiterate
hydroelectric
power
is
a
byproduct
of
the
flow
of
the
stream
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
navigation
or
the
navigational
servitude.
moreover
it
--
in
a
sense
is
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
oh,
i
have
this
answer,
sir.
i
think
we're
again
confusing
perhaps
control
versus
for
proprietorship.
no
one
disputes
the
right
of
the
federal
government
to
build
a
dike
in
front
of
our
property
and
cut
off
access.
they
could
do
it
under
the
navigational
servitude
and
we
have
no
complaint.
they
could
dredge.
and
pile
all
of
their
spoils
directly
in
front
of
the
property
and
render
it
absolutely
valueless
as
a
port
site.
again,
we're
talking
about
control
over
navigation
--
in
the
navigational
servitude.
but
when
they
come
to
taking
actual
fee
ownership
of
the
property,
this
is
a
different
story.
they
are
then
taking
from
the
owner
some
compensable
property
interest
which
either
before
had.
this
i
think
is
the
basic
distinction
in
this
case.
the
government
elected
itself
to
proceed
on
the
principles
of
eminent
domain
and
not
by
way
of
control
where
the
streams
flow.
this
was
of
course
one
of
the
things
that
was
involved
in
the
submerged
lands
act.
the
court
will
recall
that
the
primary
controversy
over
the
submerged
lands
act
was
the
impact
of
the
famous
decisions
of
this
court
with
respect
to
ownership
with
the
titled
lands
and
the
oil
lands
just
offshore.
however,
contained
in
the
submerged
lands
act
was
also
another
clause
and
another
provision
which
in
order
as
senator
holland
said
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure,
they
wish
to
confirm
title,
actual
proprietorship,
confirm
title
to
all
riparian
owners
and
to
the
states
primarily
into
their
grantees.
but
they
made
one
express
exclusion
in
this
little
section.
they
excluded
waterpower
or
the
use
of
water
for
the
protection
of
power.
they
granted
all
other
proprietary
rights
to
the
states
and
to
their
grantees.
and
as
senator
holland
pointed
out
and
i
quote,
and
he
said
this
is
his
direct
statements
on
the
floor
of
the
senate.
“taking
the
nation
as
a
whole
there
are
undoubtedly
several
billion
dollars
worth
of
port
facilities
alone
located
on
inland
waters
are
on
built
uplands
which
were
once
inland
waters".
so
it's
easy
to
understand
why
the
attorneys
general,
municipal
officers,
port
authorities,
and
other
similar
officials,
are
deeply
concerned
in
this
fight.
and
they're
insistent
that
the
congress
show
effectually
--
released
to
the
state
and
to
their
grantees
all
property
rights
in
the
inland
waters
and
their
beds
saving
only
to
the
federal
government
those
rights
which
will
enable
it
to
perform
its
constitutional
functions.
senator
holland
also
continued,
he
was
the
principal
proponent
of
the
senate
joint
resolution
13
which
later
became
known
as
the
submerged
lands
act.
that
such
developed
lands
belonging
to
private
grantees
greatly
exceeded
the
value
of
public
developments
because
there
are
only
tens
of
thousands
of
such
developments
in
the
inland
waters
of
our
nation.
a
review
of
the
entire
congressional
record
in
the
debates
on
the
submerged
lands
act
indicates
it
practically,
every
decision
of
this
court
for
the
last
hundred
years
resided.
it's
quite
clear
that
the
rationale
of
the
chandler-dunbar
case
was
clearly
understood
and
for
that
reason
a
specific
exclusion
of
waterpower,
and
the
usual
water
for
the
production
of
power
was
put
into
the
act
and
no
proprietary
rights
therein
were
granted
to
the
states
where
their
successors
where
it
signed.
but
i
think
that
clearly
the
converse
appears
except
for
water
power
and
the
usual
water
to
produce
the
power.
the
federal
government
in
the
submerged
lands
act
expressly
disclaimed
any
interest
in
and
in
effect
quitclaimed
all
of
the
proprietary
rights
in
a
pertinent
to
submerge
lands
lying
under
navigable
waters.
now
interestingly
enough
the
submerged
lands
act
was
not
cited
in
either
twin
city
or
virginia
power
company.
but
i
think
this
submission
is
not
at
all
surprising.
in
the
first
place,
the
issue
in
both
cases
involved
only
waterpower
of
the
use
of
water
to
produce
power.
there
were
no
other
fast
land
value
such
as
we
find
in
chandler-dunbar,
those
were
not
involved
in
twin
city
and
virginia
power.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
they
were
fast
land
values,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
yes
sir.
those
were
the
value
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
and
of
course
the
court
disallowed
any
fast
land
values
attributable
to
the
waterpower
or
production
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
i
should
have
stated
that
no
other
fast
land
values
of
a
riparian
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
--
of
riparian
nature
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
i
beg
your
pardon.
now
attached
to
senate
report
number
30
--
133,
a
supporting
authority
to
the
majority
report
on
the
submerged
lands
act
was
a
brief
submitted
to
the
committee
by
the
national
association
of
attorneys
general.
after
deciding
several
decisions
relating
to
the
state
proprietorship
of
submerged
lands,
the
following
language
appears.
the
states
submit
that
the
federal
government
has
paramount
powers
over
navigable
waters
to
improve
and
keep
them
open
for
public
use.
and
that
the
government
has
paramount
constitutional
powers
of
government
over
these
lands
for
national
defense,
commerce
and
international
affairs.
they
asked
merely
that
governmental
powers
be
maintained
separate
and
distinct
from
proprietorship.
and
that
no
exercise
of
governmental
powers
be
allowed
to
acquire
without
compensation
resources
that
have
here
--
before
have
been
considered
as
part
of
unattached
to
ownership
with
the
soil.
the
debates
in
the
senate
alone
on
the
submerged
lands
act
occupy
some
3,000
pages
in
the
congressional
record.
the
measure
being
discussed
while
technically
labeled,
senate
joint
resolution
13
was
merely
the
successor
to
a
host
of
prior
measures
to
which
were
passed
and
then
vetoed
by
the
president.
the
precise
legal
issue
now
before
this
court
was
not
specifically
discussed
as
such
in
those
3,000
pages
or
at
least
if
it
was,
i've
not
been
able
to
find
it.
but
the
intent
of
congress
in
passing
the
submerged
lands
act
to
protect
all
property
rights
in
hearing
in
waterfront
ownership,
on
inland
and
coastal
waters
with
the
sole
exception
of
waterpower
or
the
usual
water
for
the
production
of
power
shows
through
with
complete
clarity.
the
importance
of
the
decision
in
this
court
on
a
national
level
cannot
be
overemphasized.
billions
of
dollars
have
been
spent
in
this
country
to
acquire
waterfront
sites
not
for
the
production
of
power
but
to
enable
its
owners
to
have
access
to
navigable
water
for
commercial
and
recreational
purposes.
the
economic
impact
upon
waterfront
owners
throughout
the
nation
with
the
government's
position
is
sustained
in
this
case
would
be
catastrophic
and
would
throw
in
serious
doubt
the
ownership
and
the
use
of
the
riparian
lands.
for
example,
since
1952
more
than
6,500
plants
have
been
constructed
on
the
nation's
25,000
odd
miles
of
commercially
navigable
stream.
the
value
of
these
plants
all
of
whom
--
all
of
which
are
water
oriented,
that
is
with
docks,
and
wharves,
and
facilities,
exceed
$115
billion.
over
$1
billion
was
spent
last
year
--
in
the
last
5
years
on
one
stretch
of
the
mississippi
river
between
new
orleans
and
baton
rouge
representing
472
individual
plants
and
terminals.
the
public
investment
and
public
port
facilities
on
our
inland
waters
and
harbors
is
of
an
excessive
$7
billion
today.
let's
take
this
quick
illustration.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
he
could
be
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
no
sir,
i'm
not
saying
that.
the
government
could
deny
him
the
right
to
have
a
port
there
by
virtue.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
no.
it's
a
difference
again
between
ownership
and
control.
it
confirmed
ownership
in
those
upland
owners
and
in
the
riparian
owners.
it
left
control
in
the
federal
government.
the
federal
government
could
by
placing
a
harbor
line
right
in
front
of
this
land
and
putting
it
actually
up
on
the
dry
land.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
they
could
even
do
that.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
they
could
even
do
that.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
yes
sir.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
yes
sir.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
it
could
control
the
use
of
the
water.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
i
don't
see
it
that
way
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
i
--
like
i
said
so,
i
could
mean
to.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
we
do
however
have
uplands
involved
in
this
case
which
are
suitable
for
port
sites.
that's
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
it's
a
site
located
next
to
navigable
waters.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
undoubtedly
correct,
sir.
we
have
to
use
the
water,
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
well
if
we
are
to
believe
what
the
attorney
general's
brief
says,
they're
interested
in
seeing
that
the
federal
government
retains
its
control
over
navigable
waterways.
but
if
they
take
it
under
the
power
of
eminent
domain,
they
wish
to
be
compensated
for
it.
i
think
that's
the
intent
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
i
have
said
--
i
have
agreed
that
they
--
under
their
power
of
control,
they
could
do
that.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
may
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
gerlach
livestock
case.
in
this
case
a
congressional
declaration
of
policy
had
declared
that
the
prior
appropriation
of
irrigational
water.
now
there
again
is
a
use
of
water.
but
if
they
attempt
to
take
that
water
or
take
the
uplands
which
are
being
irrigated,
they
cannot
do
so
without
paying
compensation.
and
this
is
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
as
irrigation
water.
now
here
again,
that
requires
the
use
of
water.
i
can't
--
it's
inescapable.
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
congress
intended
in
the
submerged
lands
act
to
expand
the
doctrine
to
include
not
only
irrigable
water
and
irrigable
lands
but
whether
they
also
intended
to
cover
riparian
lands
for
use
as
a
port.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
yes
sir,
considerably.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
submit
that
in
this
particular
case
the
government
position
--
government's
position
ignores
the
basic
distinction
between
ownership
on
the
one
hand
and
control
on
the
other.
we
freely
concede
the
government's
undoubted
power
of
absolute
control
over
navigation
and
all
the
incidents
of
navigation.
we're
not
therefore
concerned
with
such
situations
as
occasion
which
the
build
--
the
government
itself
may
build
docks
and
wharves
in
front
of
the
riparian
owner's
property
and
thereby
cutoff
his
access.
this
was
the
situation
in
gibson
versus
united
states
and
scranton
versus
wheeler.
we're
not
concerned
about
the
government
moving
back
the
harbor
line
as
it
is
done
in
one
instance
in
the
past,
and
sustained
by
this
court
in
greenleaf
versus
--
greenleaf
johnson
lumber
company.
we're
not
concerned
about
the
government
dredging
up
materials
into
passing
them
in
front
of
our
lands.
this
is
the
commodore
(inaudible).
we're
not
concerned
about
the
value
of
the
uplands
because
of
the
value
in
the
flow
a
stream.
that
is
in
the
movement
of
the
water
passed
the
riparian
owner's
properties.
this
was
a
situation
in
chandler-dunbar,
in
twin
city,
and
also
in
virginia
power.
what
we
really
are
concerned
about
is,
can
the
value
of
land
taken
under
the
power
of
eminent
domain
and
that's
how
the
government
proceeded
in
this
case.
can
it
be
ignored
because
of
its
riparian
location
rather
than
perhaps
increased
in
value
as
one
would
logically
assume
would
be
the
case.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
oh,
yes
of
course
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
i
think
this
necessarily
follows,
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
--mr.
justice
white.
and
in
connection
with
your
question
of
counsel
a
moment
ago,
i
think
i
should
clarify
that
the
value
of
this
land
is
depended
upon
its
value
at
the
time
of
taking.
and
the
time
of
taking
of
course
is
prior
to
the
completion
of
john
day
dam.
and
therefore
its
value
and
its
natural
state
prior
to
the
elevation
of
the
pool
level.we
of
course
could
claim
no
incremental
value
nor
would
we
in
the
event
the
land
were
valued
after
the
dam
had
been
built
if
this
is
conceivable.
this
in
essence
was
a
situation
in
the
river
rouge
improvement
case.
there,
the
court
sent
back
the
case
to
the
lower
court
because
of
improper
constructions
by
the
lower
court
relative
to
the
value
to
be
deducted
because
of
the
existence
of
the
government's
improvement.
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
rely
very
heavily
on
river
rouge
as
well
as
chandler-dunbar
in
connection
with
our
claim
that
we're
entitled
to
compensation
as
a
port
site.
our
lands
were
for
practical
purposes
of
little
value
except
as
a
port
site.
it's
what
is
commonly
known
in
oregon
as
jackrabbit
land.
it
was
certainly
with
very
little
as
grazing
land.
historically
this
particular
location,
this
site
was
the
old
castle
rock
landing
at
which
turn
wheelers
and
barges
landed
and
discharged
various
cargos,
wool,
oil
and
wheat.
now
clearly
the
state
of
oregon
regarded
these
lands
as
being
of
considerable
value
as
a
port
site
because
they
sought
an
auction
from
the
owner
for
$400
an
acre
for
use
as
a
port
site.
keep
in
mind
that
at
this
time
the
state
of
oregon
desperately
had
to
have
this
waterfront
land
in
order
to
complete
its
boeing
space
age
park,
is
what
they
called
it.
this
was
a
concept
by
the
state
of
oregon
in
which
they
exchanged
and
purchased
lands
for
the
united
states
to
create
a
large
missile
testing
site
which
then
they
in
turn
at
least
devoid.
by
contrast
of
course
under
the
award,
the
value
received
by
the
owner
was
approximately
according
to
the
government's
brief
of
$36
and
not
calculated
at
20.
nonetheless,
as
if
to
add
insult
to
injury,
the
government
condemned.
they
refused
to
pay
1
cent
for
the
port
site
value.
they
immediately
turned
around
and
conveyed
the
lands
to
the
state
of
oregon.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
it
was
condemned
on
the
rivers
and
harbors
act.
there's
no
question
about
it
being
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
its
fair
market
value,
yes
sir.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
substantial.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
no
question
about
it
your
honor.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
it's
arguing
that
it
can
take
it
in
not
pay
one
cent
for
the
value
as
a
port
site.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
apparently
not
if
they
give
it
away.
only
if
they
take
it.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
that
is
correct.
and
generally
speaking
in
term
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
we
contend
it
did
not.
fair
market
value
has
been
construed
by
enumerable
cases
both
by
these
courts
--
by
this
court
and
all
the
courts
in
this
country
as
being
its
highest
and
best
use.
unquestionably
the
highest
and
best
use
of
this
particular
land
was
as
a
port
site.
it
certainly
was
worth
very
little,
it
was
grazing
land.
now
and
the
government
condemned,
refused
to
pay
a
cent,
conveyed
the
lands
to
the
state
of
oregon
for
the
express
purpose
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
i'm
very
sorry.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
after
having
received
the
conveyance,
the
state
of
oregon
then
in
turn
lease
the
lands
to
the
boeing
company.
and
both
conveyance
is
subject
to
port
site
was
discussed.
and
the
government's
quitclaim
deed,
they
recognized
that
these
lands
were
valuable
as
port
site
and
industrial
lands.
and
obviously,
the
only
ones
who
have
--
which
were
of
any
considerable
value
as
a
port
site
would
be
those
in
front
of
the
water
after
the
elevation
of
the
pool.
i
might
also
comment
on
--
for
whatever
bearing
it
may
have
on
the
facts
that
not
all
of
the
respondent's
lands
are
being
emendated.
it's
true
that
the
pool
elevation
does
bring
the
water
level
up
and
cover
part
of
the
lands
but
not
all
of
the
lands.
most
important
is
we
view
the
matter,
it
doesn't
require
the
completion
of
john
day
dam
to
render
these
particular
port
site
lands
valuable
as
port
sites.
the
water
depth
in
the
columbia
river
even
before
john
day
was
authorized
were
some
15
feet
directly
in
front
of
these
properties,
and
was
thus
more
than,
equipped
with
barge
transportation
with
or
without
john
day
dam.
i
might
say
that
hadn't
this
had
not
been
the
case.
and
i
think
it
rather
doubtful
that
we
would
have
been
entitled
to
any
compensation
at
all
these
port
site
lands.
it
has
to
be
the
state
of
the
lands
prior
to
the
governmental
improvement
not
afterwards.
and
it
also
has
to
be
whether
or
not
they
were
valuable
as
a
port
site
at
the
time
of
taking.
we
rely
of
course
most
heavily
on
the
chandler-dunbar,
which
of
course
was
the
case
that
was
primarily
the
basis
for
the
united
states
versus
twin
city.
and
twin
city
and
virginia
power
of
course,
are
the
two
cases
upon
which
the
government
most
heavily
relies.
it
will
be
noted
that
in
chandler-dunbar
which
primarily
concerned
hydroelectric
site
development,
there
was
no
award
given
for
lack
in
canal
purposes.
there
was
also
an
award
given
without
any
argument,
any
contention
on
the
part
of
the
government
for
wharves
and
docks.
and
that's
the
same
situation
we
have
here,
we
call
it
a
port
site.
it's
valuable
as
a
port
site
only
because
of
the
right
to
wharf
out.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
we
did
not
at
the
time
of
taking,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
it
had
been
used
historically
and
there
was
a
whole
landing
there
at
one
time.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
not
at
the
time
of
taking.
no
sir.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
yes
sir.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
around
the
turn
of
a
century,
as
near
as
we
can
tell.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
yes,
they
--
they've
secured
an
option
from
us
only
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
sir?
mr.
alex
l.
parks
well,
it
--
roughly
around
that
figure.
it
was
$400
an
acre
for
a
certain
number
of
acres.
interestingly
enough,
the
state's
option
was
on
a
lease
which
they
got
from
us
for
$1
a
year.
and
then
after
they
found
that
they
were
going
to
have
the
federal
government
condemn
them
instead
of
pay
for
it,
they
turned
around
and
held
the
land
under
the
terms
of
the
tenure
leased.
it's
a
very
interesting
proposition.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
sir?
mr.
alex
l.
parks
approximately
for
this
section,
$20
an
acre,
essentially
what
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
somewhere
around
there
sir.
but
you
see
there
was
a
lot
more
land
involved
in
the
conveyance
so
it's
a
little
difficult
to
segregate
the
two
transfers.
now,
in
this
connection
that
is
with
respect
to
wharves
and
docks
and
the
chandler-dunbar
cases,
this
court
said,
these
two
parcels
seemed
to
have
been
connected
by
a
costly
fill.
they
front
it
upon
deep
water
above
the
head
of
the
rapids.
they
have
therefore
a
special
value
for
wharves
and
docks
and
so
forth,
and
have
been
so
used.
the
gross
sum
awarded
included
the
following
elements.
(a)
for
general
wharfage,
dock
and
warehouse
purposes
disconnecting
with
the
development
of
power
in
the
rapids.
subsequently,
this
court
have
self-noted
in
twin
city
that
chandler-dunbar
gave
compensation
for
canals
and
locks.
the
court
stated
in
part
in
a
footnote,
it
may
be
that
the
court
was
influenced
by
the
fact
that
on
a
special
fact
of
the
case,
the
use
of
the
land
for
canals
and
locks
was
only
consistent
for
the
dominant
navigational
servitude
of
the
united
states
and
indeed
they
aided
navigation.
the
court
could
just
as
easily
have
used
the
term
wharves
and
docks
as
these
two
usually
were
held
compensable
in
chandler
versus
dunbar.
and
of
course,
chandler-dunbar
was
expressly
stated
in
the
twin
city
case
as
the
case
which
controls
twin
city.
it's
never
been
overruled,
nor
until
this
case
arose,
has
the
correctness
for
the
payment
of
compensation
for
wharves
and
docks
ever
been
questioned.
this
is
the
first
time
the
question
has
ever
risen.
as
a
collateral
matter,
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
we
think
that
river
rouge
is
also
directly
applicable
because
this
is
the
case
that
arose
under
33
u.s.c.
(a)
--
595,
which
provides
that
in
ascertaining
the
value
of
properties,
you
shall
not
take
into
consideration
any
increment
of
value
by
reason
of
the
government's
improvement.
in
that
particular
case,
they
--
there
were
some
confusion
over
what
are
riparian
rights?
what
do
they
mean?
are
they
rights
of
substantial
value?
this
court
held
that
the
instructions
of
the
trial
court
to
the
jury
on
this
question
did
not
sufficiently
emphasize
the
historical
value
of
riparian
rights
and
therefore
that
the
jury
undoubtedly
did
not
deduct
enough
from
the
award
relative
to
the
increment
in
value
by
reason
of
the
improvement.
now
it
seems
impossible
to
us
to
acquaint
the
result
in
river
rouge
with
the
contention
now
being
made
by
the
government.
if
any
increment
in
value
due
to
the
waterway
improvement
must
be
deducted,
how
can
it
logically
be
argued
that
it's
fair
and
proper
to
disregard
the
initial
value
which
existed
long
prior
to
the
development?
in
fact,
it's
rather
interesting
that
the
lower
court's
instruction
in
the
river
rouge
case
is
essentially
what
the
government
is
contending
today.
when
river
rouge
was
being
argued
before
this
court,
i
would
--
the
government
took
just
the
opposite
position.
now
it's
true
as
the
counsel
pointed
out
that
we
contend
that
there's
no
dependency
here
on
the
floor
of
the
stream.
mr.
justice
white,
you
pointed
out
correctly
so
sir
that
the
presence
of
water
is
absolutely
necessary,
or
else
you
don't
have
a
port
site.
however,
hydroelectric
site
that
is
a
wholly
dependent
upon
the
flow
of
the
stream,
in
this
case
no
such
dependency
exists.
as
results
have
pointed
out
in
twin
city
was
respect
to
the
court's
reasoning
in
chandler-dunbar,
the
use
of
respondent's
port
site
lands
is
wholly
consistent
with
the
dominant
navigational
servitude
of
the
government
and
in
fact
would
actually
aid
navigation.
a
hydroelectric
power
site
to
be
of
value
requires
the
dam
across
the
entire
reach
of
the
stream.
and
thus,
in
a
sense,
is
inimical
to
navigation
unless
locks
are
installed
in
the
dam.
port
site
value
exist
however
particularly
in
this
case
whether
or
not
a
dam
has
ever
constructed.
hydroelectric
power
site
value
is
relatively
new
in
concept,
it
having
come
into
existence
chiefly
in
the
last
50
to
75
years.
on
the
other
hand,
port
site
values
date
back
to
the
inception
of
english
jurisprudence
and
have
always
been
recognized
as
valuable
riparian
rights.
we
further
contend
the
congress
has
in
the
submerged
lands
act
indicated
a
national
policy
to
protect
and
preserve
the
property
rights
of
the
states
and
their
grantees
in
submerged
imminent
waters.
it
will
indeed
be
anomalous
to
preserve
such
rights
in
submerged
lands
and
deny
those
same
rights
with
respect
to
upland
properties.our
stating
at
another
fashion,
the
submerged
lands
act
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
ownership
of
riparian
lands
is
vested
in
the
states
and
their
grantees,
control
of
the
navigation
remains
in
the
federal
government.
in
this
case
having
elected
to
proceed
by
the
condemnation
route,
the
government
is
obliged
to
pay
just
compensation.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
no
sir.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
i
think
the
essential
difference
is
--
differences
i
should
say,
plural
or
two.
one
is
that
historically,
riparian
property
rights
have
always
been
recognized
as
valuable
property
rights;
the
right
of
access,
the
right
of
fishery,
the
right
of
--
in
and
over
the
land
between
high
and
low
watermark.
this
concept
has
never
changed
at
least
until
this
case
arose.
but
more
important,
the
development
of
hydroelectric
power
is
not
an
aid
of
navigation.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
navigability
of
the
stream.
it's
a
by-product
as
it
were
of
the
flow
of
the
stream.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
unfortunately
i
can't.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
at
first
blush,
it
might
seem
rather
unusual
that
the
submerged
lands
act
would
deem
to
apply
to
this
case
at
all.
it's
true
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
no
sir,
i
would
hope
not.
its
--
may
i
phrase
it
in
the
converse?
that
again
to
reiterate
hydroelectric
power
is
a
byproduct
of
the
flow
of
the
stream
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
navigation
or
the
navigational
servitude.
moreover
it
--
in
a
sense
is
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
oh,
i
have
this
answer,
sir.
i
think
we're
again
confusing
perhaps
control
versus
for
proprietorship.
no
one
disputes
the
right
of
the
federal
government
to
build
a
dike
in
front
of
our
property
and
cut
off
access.
they
could
do
it
under
the
navigational
servitude
and
we
have
no
complaint.
they
could
dredge.
and
pile
all
of
their
spoils
directly
in
front
of
the
property
and
render
it
absolutely
valueless
as
a
port
site.
again,
we're
talking
about
control
over
navigation
--
in
the
navigational
servitude.
but
when
they
come
to
taking
actual
fee
ownership
of
the
property,
this
is
a
different
story.
they
are
then
taking
from
the
owner
some
compensable
property
interest
which
either
before
had.
this
i
think
is
the
basic
distinction
in
this
case.
the
government
elected
itself
to
proceed
on
the
principles
of
eminent
domain
and
not
by
way
of
control
where
the
streams
flow.
this
was
of
course
one
of
the
things
that
was
involved
in
the
submerged
lands
act.
the
court
will
recall
that
the
primary
controversy
over
the
submerged
lands
act
was
the
impact
of
the
famous
decisions
of
this
court
with
respect
to
ownership
with
the
titled
lands
and
the
oil
lands
just
offshore.
however,
contained
in
the
submerged
lands
act
was
also
another
clause
and
another
provision
which
in
order
as
senator
holland
said
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure,
they
wish
to
confirm
title,
actual
proprietorship,
confirm
title
to
all
riparian
owners
and
to
the
states
primarily
into
their
grantees.
but
they
made
one
express
exclusion
in
this
little
section.
they
excluded
waterpower
or
the
use
of
water
for
the
protection
of
power.
they
granted
all
other
proprietary
rights
to
the
states
and
to
their
grantees.
and
as
senator
holland
pointed
out
and
i
quote,
and
he
said
this
is
his
direct
statements
on
the
floor
of
the
senate.
“taking
the
nation
as
a
whole
there
are
undoubtedly
several
billion
dollars
worth
of
port
facilities
alone
located
on
inland
waters
are
on
built
uplands
which
were
once
inland
waters".
so
it's
easy
to
understand
why
the
attorneys
general,
municipal
officers,
port
authorities,
and
other
similar
officials,
are
deeply
concerned
in
this
fight.
and
they're
insistent
that
the
congress
show
effectually
--
released
to
the
state
and
to
their
grantees
all
property
rights
in
the
inland
waters
and
their
beds
saving
only
to
the
federal
government
those
rights
which
will
enable
it
to
perform
its
constitutional
functions.
senator
holland
also
continued,
he
was
the
principal
proponent
of
the
senate
joint
resolution
13
which
later
became
known
as
the
submerged
lands
act.
that
such
developed
lands
belonging
to
private
grantees
greatly
exceeded
the
value
of
public
developments
because
there
are
only
tens
of
thousands
of
such
developments
in
the
inland
waters
of
our
nation.
a
review
of
the
entire
congressional
record
in
the
debates
on
the
submerged
lands
act
indicates
it
practically,
every
decision
of
this
court
for
the
last
hundred
years
resided.
it's
quite
clear
that
the
rationale
of
the
chandler-dunbar
case
was
clearly
understood
and
for
that
reason
a
specific
exclusion
of
waterpower,
and
the
usual
water
for
the
production
of
power
was
put
into
the
act
and
no
proprietary
rights
therein
were
granted
to
the
states
where
their
successors
where
it
signed.
but
i
think
that
clearly
the
converse
appears
except
for
water
power
and
the
usual
water
to
produce
the
power.
the
federal
government
in
the
submerged
lands
act
expressly
disclaimed
any
interest
in
and
in
effect
quitclaimed
all
of
the
proprietary
rights
in
a
pertinent
to
submerge
lands
lying
under
navigable
waters.
now
interestingly
enough
the
submerged
lands
act
was
not
cited
in
either
twin
city
or
virginia
power
company.
but
i
think
this
submission
is
not
at
all
surprising.
in
the
first
place,
the
issue
in
both
cases
involved
only
waterpower
of
the
use
of
water
to
produce
power.
there
were
no
other
fast
land
value
such
as
we
find
in
chandler-dunbar,
those
were
not
involved
in
twin
city
and
virginia
power.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
they
were
fast
land
values,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
yes
sir.
those
were
the
value
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
and
of
course
the
court
disallowed
any
fast
land
values
attributable
to
the
waterpower
or
production
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
i
should
have
stated
that
no
other
fast
land
values
of
a
riparian
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
--
of
riparian
nature
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
i
beg
your
pardon.
now
attached
to
senate
report
number
30
--
133,
a
supporting
authority
to
the
majority
report
on
the
submerged
lands
act
was
a
brief
submitted
to
the
committee
by
the
national
association
of
attorneys
general.
after
deciding
several
decisions
relating
to
the
state
proprietorship
of
submerged
lands,
the
following
language
appears.
the
states
submit
that
the
federal
government
has
paramount
powers
over
navigable
waters
to
improve
and
keep
them
open
for
public
use.
and
that
the
government
has
paramount
constitutional
powers
of
government
over
these
lands
for
national
defense,
commerce
and
international
affairs.
they
asked
merely
that
governmental
powers
be
maintained
separate
and
distinct
from
proprietorship.
and
that
no
exercise
of
governmental
powers
be
allowed
to
acquire
without
compensation
resources
that
have
here
--
before
have
been
considered
as
part
of
unattached
to
ownership
with
the
soil.
the
debates
in
the
senate
alone
on
the
submerged
lands
act
occupy
some
3,000
pages
in
the
congressional
record.
the
measure
being
discussed
while
technically
labeled,
senate
joint
resolution
13
was
merely
the
successor
to
a
host
of
prior
measures
to
which
were
passed
and
then
vetoed
by
the
president.
the
precise
legal
issue
now
before
this
court
was
not
specifically
discussed
as
such
in
those
3,000
pages
or
at
least
if
it
was,
i've
not
been
able
to
find
it.
but
the
intent
of
congress
in
passing
the
submerged
lands
act
to
protect
all
property
rights
in
hearing
in
waterfront
ownership,
on
inland
and
coastal
waters
with
the
sole
exception
of
waterpower
or
the
usual
water
for
the
production
of
power
shows
through
with
complete
clarity.
the
importance
of
the
decision
in
this
court
on
a
national
level
cannot
be
overemphasized.
billions
of
dollars
have
been
spent
in
this
country
to
acquire
waterfront
sites
not
for
the
production
of
power
but
to
enable
its
owners
to
have
access
to
navigable
water
for
commercial
and
recreational
purposes.
the
economic
impact
upon
waterfront
owners
throughout
the
nation
with
the
government's
position
is
sustained
in
this
case
would
be
catastrophic
and
would
throw
in
serious
doubt
the
ownership
and
the
use
of
the
riparian
lands.
for
example,
since
1952
more
than
6,500
plants
have
been
constructed
on
the
nation's
25,000
odd
miles
of
commercially
navigable
stream.
the
value
of
these
plants
all
of
whom
--
all
of
which
are
water
oriented,
that
is
with
docks,
and
wharves,
and
facilities,
exceed
$115
billion.
over
$1
billion
was
spent
last
year
--
in
the
last
5
years
on
one
stretch
of
the
mississippi
river
between
new
orleans
and
baton
rouge
representing

individual
plants
and
terminals.
the
public
investment
and
public
port
facilities
on
our
inland
waters
and
harbors
is
of
an
excessive
$7
billion
today.
let's
take
this
quick
illustration.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
he
could
be
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
no
sir,
i'm
not
saying
that.
the
government
could
deny
him
the
right
to
have
a
port
there
by
virtue.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
no.
it's
a
difference
again
between
ownership
and
control.
it
confirmed
ownership
in
those
upland
owners
and
in
the
riparian
owners.
it
left
control
in
the
federal
government.
the
federal
government
could
by
placing
a
harbor
line
right
in
front
of
this
land
and
putting
it
actually
up
on
the
dry
land.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
they
could
even
do
that.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
they
could
even
do
that.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
yes
sir.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
yes
sir.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
it
could
control
the
use
of
the
water.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
i
don't
see
it
that
way
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
i
--
like
i
said
so,
i
could
mean
to.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
we
do
however
have
uplands
involved
in
this
case
which
are
suitable
for
port
sites.
that's
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
it's
a
site
located
next
to
navigable
waters.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
undoubtedly
correct,
sir.
we
have
to
use
the
water,
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
well
if
we
are
to
believe
what
the
attorney
general's
brief
says,
they're
interested
in
seeing
that
the
federal
government
retains
its
control
over
navigable
waterways.
but
if
they
take
it
under
the
power
of
eminent
domain,
they
wish
to
be
compensated
for
it.
i
think
that's
the
intent
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
i
have
said
--
i
have
agreed
that
they
--
under
their
power
of
control,
they
could
do
that.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
may
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
gerlach
livestock
case.
in
this
case
a
congressional
declaration
of
policy
had
declared
that
the
prior
appropriation
of
irrigational
water.
now
there
again
is
a
use
of
water.
but
if
they
attempt
to
take
that
water
or
take
the
uplands
which
are
being
irrigated,
they
cannot
do
so
without
paying
compensation.
and
this
is
--
mr.
alex
l.
parks
as
irrigation
water.
now
here
again,
that
requires
the
use
of
water.
i
can't
--
it's
inescapable.
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
congress
intended
in
the
submerged
lands
act
to
expand
the
doctrine
to
include
not
only
irrigable
water
and
irrigable
lands
but
whether
they
also
intended
to
cover
riparian
lands
for
use
as
a
port.
mr.
alex
l.
parks
yes
sir,
considerably.
