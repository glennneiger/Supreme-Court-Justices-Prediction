justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
the
federal
government
would
have
transferred
the
land
to
oregon
for
the
condition
on
it
that
this
land
would
be
used
as
a
port
site
or
it
can
revert
for
united
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
are
going
to
cover
this
land
so
that
it
would
have
no
value
as
a
port
site,
wouldn't
have
any
value
as
of
--
as
in
a
--
as
land
on
which
you
operate
a
port.if
you're
going
to
cover
it
up
well
that's
the
easy
answer
to
the
united
states
against
the
--
this
case.
this
didn't
have
any
value
for
the
port
sites.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me
with
the
united
states
so
as
the
state
of
oregon
you
either
use
it
for
a
port
or
you
got
to
give
it
back
to
us.
they
--
you
do
say
that
it
doesn't
have
a
port
site
value.
it
doesn't
answer
whether
you
have
to
pay
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
another
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
someone
who
wants
to
develop
a
port
on
a
stream
like
this
have
to
have
a
permit
from
the
federal
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
the
united
states
within
its
navigational
servitude
have
the
right
to
say
of
a
port
should
not
be
located
at
this
point,
at
point
a
but
rather
at
point
b?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
the
united
states
decided
that
there
should
be
a
port
on
this
area
but
at
point
b,
there
will
not
be
one
at
point
a,
this
land
would've
had
no
value
as
a
port
site.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there's
no
riparian
right
to
use
the
water
for
a
port
--
leaving
and
coming
to
land.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
value
that
you're
talking
about
is
a
value
as
an
enhancement
which
flows
from
the
use
of
water
in
some
way
maybe
not
in
the
flow
but
in
the
use
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
we're
not
just
talking
about
enhancement
from
location.
you're
talking
--
it's
got
to
be
used
of
the
water.
i
suppose
if
the
government
were
condemning
lands
which
have
been
used
as
houses
is
the
--
there
--
if
the
property
has
more
value
because
if
--
had
a
pretty
view
and
was
alongside
the
river,
you
might
recognize
that
value
because
of
its
location.
this
value
you're
talking
about
is
involves
the
--
flows
from
the
use
of
water,
participated
in
use
--
in
the
use
of
the
water
at
the
port
site.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
statute
was
it
condemnable?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
standard
of
value
in
the
rivers
and
harbors
act?
does
it
say
fair
market
value
or
what
does
it
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
no
doubt
that
between
private
parties,
this
land
could've
been
bought
and
sold
at
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
considerably
enhanced
price
because
of
its
value
as
a
port.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
a
--
but
you
aren't
arguing
but
--
and
but
united
states
--
even
if
it
has
a
fair
market
value
in
the
private
market
as
a
port
site,
the
government
is
arguing
what,
that
a
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it's
constitutionally
entitled
to
do
that?
well,
what
if
congress
intended
to
give
you
the
value
of
the
port
site?
i
guess
there's
--
it's
not
against
that
--
that
doesn't
make
them
unconstitutionally?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
if
they
say,
"we
will
pay
the
fair
market
value
of
the
land",
then
the
issue
becomes
what
is
fair
marketing
--
what
its
fair
market
value
mean
in
the
intent
of
congress.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
constitutionally
been
able
to
exclude
the
port
site
value
but
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
also
the
state
(inaudible)
on
this
land
for
port
development
purposes?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
$50,000?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
$50,000?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
they
paid
the
government
17
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
had
they
--
had
the
--
how
much
did
oregon
pay
the
united
states
for
the
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
$17,000?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
here
--
i
guess
--
suppose
your
argument
would
be
to
the
conclusion
wholly
commentary
to
what
the
counsel
for
the
government
should
involve
(inaudible).
you
would
say
the
riparian
owner
(inaudible)
submerged
lands
act
does
have
the
power
which
the
government
(inaudible)
to
have
the
port,
that's
point
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
riparian
owner,
he
should
develop
a
port
there.
that's
how
we
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
--
how
could
you
say
that
the
submerged
lands
act
(inaudible)
riparian
owners,
that
is
port
facilities
or
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
i
am
trying
to
say
is
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
by
someone
else,
suppose
to
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
that
really
means
there
is,
the
government
still
owns
the
water,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
they
could
control
the
use
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
value
--
you're
talking
about
perhaps
on
the
use
of
the
water.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
without
the
use
of
the
water,
the
value
you're
talking
about
is
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
what's
a
port
site?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
well,
it's
not
a
port
site
though
except
from
the
assumption
that
you
can
use
the
water.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
really
comes
to
the
submerged
land
act
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
know,
if
they
take
it
that
all
the
united
states
(inaudible)
you
don't
have
a
water
and
we
can
control
the
--
and
then
the
value
you're
talking
about
rest
on
the
use
of
the
water
but
you
don't
own
the
right
to
use
the
water.
you
just
don't
know
that
fact
at
all
so
why
is
it
(inaudible).
you
can
suggest
that
the
government
could've,
to
say
without
compensating
you
at
all,
that
you
may
not
use
this
site
as
a
port.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
it
then
that
you
and
the
(inaudible)
but
that
wouldn't
give
you
a
right
for
compensation.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
what
other
statutes
--
does
that
make
any
reference
to
another
statute
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
generally
applicable,
the
condemnation
statute
which
--
under
which
the
government
concedes
the
declaration
of
(inaudible)
etcetera?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
it
expressed
that
there's
no
such
--
that
they
shall
be
paid
the
fair
market
value
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
anything
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
--
why
would
they
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
the
twin
city
dealt
with.
justice
byron

white
well,
i

the

it

that

that

that's
the

this

it
doesn't
answer
whether

justice

it's
another

justice

does
someone

so

there
will

there's
no

leaving

justice

but
the

justice

we're
not
just
talking
about

from

you're
talking
--
it's
got
to
be

of
the

i
suppose
if
the

so

even
