petitioner
versus
r.

rands
et
al.
gentlemen,
before
mr.
gooch
and
mr.
douglas,
i'd
just
like
to
say
that
this
is
another
case
where
counsel
is
representing
an
indigent
defendant.
and
i
want
to
tell
you
what
a
comfort
it
is
to
the
court
to
know
that
lawyers
and
various
communities
are
willing
to
give
their
services
to
a
cause
of
this
kind
because
every
man,
rich
or
poor
should
have
a
defense
through
counsel.
so,
i
appreciate
very
much
and
in
behalf
of
the
court,
i
express
it
to
you,
mr.
gooch,
for
having
accepted
this
responsibility.
and
mr.
douglas,
of
course,
we
appreciate
the
manner
in
which
you
represent
the
state
of
texas
in
this
manner.
