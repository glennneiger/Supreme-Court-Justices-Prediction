justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
posner,
do
you
think
it's
contrary
to
the
present
criminal
rules
for
a
judge
to
say
that
i'm
going
to
do
this
every
time
unless
the
government
shows
some
special
reason
why
it
shouldn't
be
done?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
--
are
you
going
to
talk
about
what
the
--
what
the
case
is
around
the
court
of
appeals,
the
district
courts
--
what
those
cases
hold
in
regard
to
the
function
of
the
bill
of
particulars
with
respect
to
the
names
of
witnesses?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
function
of
a
bill
of
particular
in
the
government's
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
prepare
a
defense
by
talking
to
the
fellow?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
the
government
is
going
to
use
a
witness
to
whom
the
defendant
has
spoken
at
some
time
before
the
trial,
why
wouldn't
the
same
reason
apply
in
terms
of
the
function
of
bill
of
particulars
as
applies
in
the
roviaro
versus
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
one
suggested,
if
the
government
came
in
and
said
that
that
isn't
involved
in
this
case,
but
if
the
government
came
in
and
said,
there
is
a
special
reason
why
we
don't
want
to
give
the
name
of
this
person,
why
--
i
suppose
the
judge
could
not
make
you
give
his
name
and
of
course
if
you
are
going
to
use
him
as
a
witness,
you
are
going
to
surface
him
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
again
going
back
to
the
bill
of
particulars
mr.
postner,
isn't
it,
rather
easy
to
articulate
this
kind
of
a
rule
that
judge
will
has
in
terms
of
the
function
of
the
bill
of
particulars?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
it's
rather
important
for
him
to
know,
in
preparing
his
defense
what
the
critical
testimony
will
be
against
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
maybe
one
thing
to
say
that
we
are
only
going
to
have
depositions,
compulsory
depositions
in
limited
--
in
some
circumstances,
but
another
thing
is
they
would
--
that
the
defendant
should
have
the
opportunity
at
least
to
talk
to
them,
witnesses
don't
need
to
talk
to
defendants,
they
don't
want
to,
do
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
agree
that
bill
of
particulars
has
a
different
function
in
criminal
cases
and
in
civil?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
it's
not
just
to
clarify
what
the
charge
is,
what
the
indictment
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
concede
--
the
government
concedes
this
function
of
the
bill
of
particulars
in
our
system
under
our
rules
under
our
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
prepare
a
defense?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
judge
will's
order
go
beyond
those
people
whom
you
were
going
to
use
as
witnesses,
it
did,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
required
you
to
name
people
whom
you
didn't
intend
to
use
as
witnesses
perhaps
for
some
other
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
–
do
you
make
some
special
objection
to
that,
that
would
cover
your
any
kind
of
an
informant
whether
he
wanted
to
keep
them
secret
or
not?
justice
