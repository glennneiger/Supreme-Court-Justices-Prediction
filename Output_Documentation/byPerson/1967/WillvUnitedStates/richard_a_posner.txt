mr.
richard
a.
posner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
few
moments
that
remain,
i’d
like
to
address
myself
briefly
to
the
jurisdictional
issue
here,
which
has
to
do
with
the
scope
of
the
power
of
court
of
appeals
to
issue
writs
of
mandamus
in
federal,
criminal
cases
at
the
behest
of
the
government.
we
sense
some
ambiguity,
some
contradiction
in
the
argument
that
petitioner
has
made
here.
on
the
one
hand,
he
suggests
that
because
the
government
ordinarily
cannot
appeal
an
adverse
judgment
in
a
criminal
case,
therefore
for
the
government
to
seek
mandamus
is
not
a
--
not
properly
to
invoke
the
appellate
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals.
now
just
two
terms
ago
on
the
dean
foods
case,
in
384
u.s,
the
court
made
quite
clear
that
even
in
a
situation
where
the
only
right
of
appeal
is
that
of
a
private
individual
that
was
a
case
of
a
respondent
before
the
federal
trade
commission,
the
government
may
still
in
an
appropriate
case
ask
for
mandamus.
so
the
test
of
whether
a
writ
is
appropriately
in
aid
of
appellate
jurisdiction
is
whether
some
party
to
the
proceeding
at
some
point
has
a
right
of
appeal.
now
while
making
this
argument,
petitioner
at
the
same
time
appears
to
concede
the
validity
of
a
series
of
cases
in
this
court,
the
ex
parte
united
states
cases
and
two
others,
in
which
the
government
in
criminal
cases
was
allowed
to
obtain
a
writ
of
mandamus.
the
test
petitioner
suggests
is
that,
that
is
perhaps
proper
where
it
is
necessary
to
enable
the
government
to
place
the
man
on
trial
or
to
impose
a
sentence,
but
were
denied
the
power
in
every
other
case.
this
seems
to
us
to
lead
to
highly
anomalous
results
and
an
example
may
make
this
clear.
suppose
that
judge
will
adopted
the
practice
in
his
courtroom
of
permitting
the
defendant
to
subpoena
and
depose
all
government
witnesses
routinely
just
as
in
a
civil
case,
it’s
quite
clear
that
the
federal
criminal
rules
do
not
afford
the
same
discovery
powers
as
the
federal
civil
rules,
and
that
indeed
this
court
in
revising
these
criminal
rules
from
time
to
time
has
declined
to
assimilate
the
civil
and
criminal
proceeding
in
this
respect.
though
--
now
the
logic
of
petitioner’s
position
is
that
however
patent
and
extreme
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
pardon?
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
think
when
the
court
is
urged
as
it
has
been
urged
to
broaden
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
it
is
the
court
that
promulgates
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
the
rules
and
i
assume
approves
the
work
of
the
committee
when
it
adopts
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
agree,
perhaps
i
should
not
say
it
was
the
court
that
declined,
but
whoever
should
take
responsibility
for
the
federal
criminal
rules,
they
do
impose,
they
do
define
federal
district
judge’s
power
in
criminal
cases.
it
seems
to
us
that
in
cases
where
federal
district
judges
persistently
or
blatantly
ignore
these
rules
there
must
be
a
remedy
for
assuring
compliance.
the
rules
are
promulgated
to
have
uniform
application
throughout
the
federal
court
systems
and
it
seems
to
us
intolerable
that
every
federal
judge
could
be
a
law
unto
himself
in
these
procedural
questions.
again,
i
sense
an
element
of
contradiction
here
in
petitioner’s
argument
because
he
recognizes
that
there
are
cases
where
the
u.s.
attorney
might
simply
refuse
to
comply
with
the
district
court’s
order
and
the
district
judge
would
adjudge
him
in
contempt
and
an
appeal
would
then
lie.
so
he
does
recognize
the
contempt
proceedings
at
least
as
an
escape
valve
by
which
the
courts
of
appeals
can
review
district
judge’s
procedural
rulings.
it
seems
to
us
furthermore
orderly
procedure
to
recognize
a
mandamus
remedy
in
this
class
of
cases.
we
don’t
suggest
that
this
is
all
cases
or
most
cases
where
the
government
feels
there
is
error
in
a
district
court
ruling,
but
only
those
unusual
cases,
which
either
present
a
novel
issue
or
show
a
clear
case
of
persistent
refusal
to
comply
by
the
district
court
with
these
requirements.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well
the
district
judge
as
he
stated
in
one
of
the
colloquies
in
this
case
at
page,
i
believe
at
page
95
--
page
75
of
the
record,
admits
that
it
is
his
consistent
practice
in
all
criminal
cases
to
require
this
list
of
witnesses.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well
i
would
say
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
i
don’t,
i
can't
agree
with
that.
i
think
it
is
certainly
relevant
if
a
judge
has
not
once
but
persistently
adopted
a
practice
which
appears
to
be
in
conflict
with
the
rules.
mandamus
is
an
extraordinary
remedy.
it
is
far
more
appropriately
employed,
it
seems
to
us,
where
there
is
a
consistent
pattern
applying
to
many
cases
and
not
simply
what
could
be
viewed
as
isolated
error.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
mandamus
has
been
viewed,
i
don’t
know
that
i
would
use
the
word
discipline,
but
in
a
private
case
like
the
la
buy
case,
when
this
court
said
that
judge
la
buy
--
issued
a
writ
of
mandamus
against
judge
la
buy
because
he
was
referring
cases
to
masters
in
circumstances
which
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
no,
but
the
court
stated
that
judge,
that
in
the
district
in
question,
this
had
been
a
frequent
practice
and
the
court
viewed
this
as
distinctly
relevant
to
the
propriety
of
the
--
of
intervening
in
district
court
procedures.
the
fact
that
there
has
been
a
consistent
non-compliance
with
the
rules.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
don’t
suggest
that
the
sole
reason
why
the
government
declined
to
comply
with
the
judge’s
order
was
that
he
had
issued
similar
orders
in
the
past.
i
think
it’s
also
felt
that
there
is
an
important
principle
here
as
to
the
scope
of
discovery
a
criminal
case,
which
is
appropriately
decided
by
the
appellate
courts
rather
than
by
judge
will’s
and
when
i
resume
tomorrow
i
will
consider
what
it
is
about
this
practice
that
in
our
view
requires
correction.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
afternoon
the
discussion
centered
on
the
jurisdictional
issue
relating
to
the
powers
of
the
courts
of
appeals
to
issue
writs
of
mandamus
at
the
behest
of
the
government
in
criminal
cases.
and
unless
there
are
further
questions
on
that
phase
of
the
case,
i'd
like
to
turn
my
attention
to
the
issue
on
the
merits,
and
that
is
the
propriety
of
judge
will's
ruling
in
this
case
that
the
government
must
turn
over
to
the
defense,
a
list
of
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
individuals
to
whom
the
defendant
had
made
statements
relating
to
the
crime.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
address
myself
to
that
question.
petitioner's
counsel
mentioned
the
apex
case,
which
does
--
a
ninth
circuit
case
i
believe,
which
holds
that
the
only,
the
government
may
only
appeal
the
dismissal
of
an
indictment
when
the
reason
for
the
dismissal
has
to
do
with
the
validity
of
the
indictment.
while
the
issue
has
not
been
authoritatively
resolved
by,
has
not
been
addressed
by
this
court,
i
think
the
government
at
least
tacitly
accepts
the
apex
principle
and
would
not
attempt
to
appeal
a
dismissal
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
judge's
order.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
correct,
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
you
mean
in
terms
of
direct
appeal
to
this
court?
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
that
would
only
be
where
the
issues
are
of
statutory
construction.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
but
even
there
the,
there
is
this
view
that
no
appeal
lies
unless
the
validity
of
the
indictment
itself
is
questioned.
now,
to
us
the
essential
point
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
judge
will's
ruling
is
that
the
federal
criminal
rule
simply
do
not
contain
any
authority
for
this
kind
of
disclosure
of
the
government's
case.
now,
two
years
ago
when
the
federal
rules
were
extensively
revised
in
this
area
of
discovery,
it
was
urged
upon
the
revisers
that
many
of
the
principles
of
civil
discovery
be
carried
into
the
criminal
sphere,
and
specifically
that
a
list
of
witnesses
that
the
government
intended
to
call
be
furnished
to
the
defense
in
advance
of
trial
and
the
revisers
declined
to
make
that
change
and
you
will
find
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
think
i
believe
that's
how
it
read,
but
i
think
that
judge
will
has
adopted
a
policy
of
routinely
making
this
information
available
to
the
defense
rather
than
requiring
any
showing
of
particular
need
on
the
part
of
the
defense.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
we
contend
that
the
order
is
erroneous
insofar
as
it
does
reflect
a
practice
of
routinely
making
--
ordering
these
disclosures
without
regard
to
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
case.
had
judge
will
found
something
special
in
the
facts
here,
had
the
defense
argued
that
there
was
something
special
in
the
facts
here,
which
required
disclosure
of
this
information
that
would
be
a
different
case.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
without
reopening
that
issue
completely,
i
note
that
in
the
la
buy
case
in
352
united
states,
a
major
statement
of
this
court
as
to
the
function
of
mandamus,
the
court
in
noting
that
mandamus
should
be
resorted
to
only
in
extreme
cases
went
on
to
say,
and
i'm
quoting
the
supreme
court,
“there
is
an
end
of
patience
and
it
clearly
appears
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
for
years
admonished
the
trial
judges
of
the
seventh
circuit
that
the
practice
of
making
references
does
not
commend
itself.
and
the
court
goes
on
to
point
out
that
in
1942
and
subsequent
occasions
the
court
had
rebuked,
court
of
appeals
had
rebuked
the
district
court.
it
emphasizes
the
fact
that
the
particular
judge
involved
in
that
case
had
referred
11
cases
to
masters
in
the
past
six
years.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well
judge
will
himself
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
judge
will
states
in
one
of
the
colloquies
in
this
case,
and
this
is
in
the
record
that
is,
this
is
perhaps
the
50th
time
in
which
he
has
had
occasion
to
make
this
kind
of
order
of
disclosure,
which
the
government
views
as
unauthorized
and
we
think
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
but
i
think
the
essential
point
is
that
in
judge
will's
view
of
this
area,
he
does
not
require
that
any
special
reason
to
be
shown
for
this
kind
disclosure.
he
regards
this
as
a
routine
matter
that
anyone
who
has
been
present
either
at
the
commission
of
the
crime
or
when
the
defendant
was
talking
about
the
crime
has
a
right
to
--
that
all
those
names
must
be
disclosed
and
as
i
say
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
i
believe
it
is
contrary.
the
only
basis
in
the
federal
rules
for
disclosure
of
a
witness'
name
is
if
it
is
necessary
to
comply
with
a
proper
request
for
a
bill
of
particular.
there's
no
discovery
mechanism
as
such
by
which
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
the
cases
which
petitioner
cites,
number
of
cases
for
the
proposition
that
this
a
common
practice
almost
invariably
concern
the
situation
that
was
presented
in
the
roviaro
case
where
the
crime
itself
has,
the
--
an
essential
participant
in
the
crime
has
been
a
government
informant.
government
informant
has
purchased
the
narcotics
or
has
furnished
the
stolen
property
to
the
defendant.
in
those
circumstances
where
the
informant,
the
government
witnesses
at
the
very
center
of
the
crime
itself,
many
courts
have
made
that
name
available
to
the
defense.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
we
view
it
as,
apart
from
any
function
it
may
have
with
relation
to
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
its
purpose
is
to
enable
the
defense,
to
the
defendant
to
prepare
defense
and
present
a
defense
without
unfair
surprise.
that
has
been
held
to
require
that
if,
for
example,
as
in
the
roviaro
case,
the
indictment
states
that
the
crime
is
the
sale
of
narcotics
to
john
doe,
not
otherwise
identified
the
name
of
that
witness,
of
that
not
necessarily
witness,
the
name
of
that
participant
in
the
crime
should
be
available
to
the
defendant
at
least
in
some
cases,
so
that
he
can
prepare
a
defense.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
talking
to
him
or
interviewing
him,
or
perhaps
to
find
out
what
actual
circumstances
there
were.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
i
think
the
roviaro
rule
and
other
decisions,
which
have
authorized
disclosure,
strike
a
balance
between
two
significant
interests.
one
is
the
defendant's
interest
in
preparing
his
case
and
the
other,
a
very
important
interest
in
the
government's
view,
is
that
of
the
confidentially
of
informants.
now
in
this
--
in
a
case
like
this
the
issue
arises
in
this
fashion,
in
intern--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
this
is
not,
the
problem
here
is
not
that
of
the
informant
that
the
government
wants
to
keep
confidential
for
use
in
subsequent
cases
nor
is
the
problem
a,
the
kind
of
problem
which
the
government
can
ordinarily
furnish
special
reason.
the
problem
is
this
in
internal
revenue
case,
that
very
often
the
government
learns
violations
of
the
income
tax
laws
through
friends,
or
acquaintances,
or
former
employees,
or
other
associates
of
the
defendant,
who
come
forward
with
this
information
either
out
of
public
sense
of
public
duty
or
because
there
is
a
bounty
for
this
kind
of
information.
now
these
people
then
will
often
furnish
not
only
lease,
but
very
important
evidence
of
admissions
at
the
trial,
evidence
which
is
highly
material
on
the
issue
of
willfulness.
if
a
person
has
been
bragging
to
his
friend
or
acquaintance
that
his
skill
in
outwitting
the
internal
revenue
service,
that
individual's
testimony
of
this
admission
will
be
highly
material
in
adjudging
the
willfulness
of
the
violation.
now
if
the
names
of
those
individuals
are
available
to
the
defendant,
there
is
a
danger
which
the
service
believes
is
a
substantial
one,
that
the
defendant
will
appeal
directly
or
indirectly
to
the
friendship
or
sympathy
of
these
individuals
or
in
some
cases
there
maybe
elements
of
bribery
involved
to
shade
the
testimony
or
to
develop
a
lapse
of
memory
when
it
comes
to
the
trial
or
otherwise
change
their
testimony.
this
is
a
--
dangers
of
this
sort
are
the
historical
reason
why
discovery
in
criminal
cases
has
been
very
limited,
the
fear
that--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
this
is
a
tax
fraud
case.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
danger
of
which
i
am
speaking
here
is
not
the
danger
of
rubbing
out
witnesses,
that
is
a
danger
in
another
areas,
the
narcotics
area,
it
is
a
danger
of
distortion
and
fabrication
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
i
am
talking
rubbing
out
in
–
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--the
tax
context
i
am
talking
of--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
they
are
not
likely
to
be
aware
of
what
--
assuming
that
the
defendant
has
made
statements,
admissions
to
a
number
of
people,
he
will
not
know
whether
they
are
going
to
testify
against
him,
whether
they
turned
state's
evidence
or
anything
of
that
sort.
now
the
distinction
has
been
urged,
continues
to
be
urged
between
civil
and
criminal
cases
in
this
regard
on
the
basis
of
the
greater
stakes
from
the
defendant
standpoint
in
a
criminal
case.
but
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
this
is
a
correct
view,
that
it
should
be
paramount
to
the
defendant's
right
to
prepare
a
defense.
but
all
these
issues
were
laid
before
the
revisers
of
the
criminal
rules
two
years
ago,
the
same
argument
i
am
suggesting
here
was
made
and
the
court
or
the
advisory
committee
in
congress
declined
to
establish
any
broad
rule
of
discovery.
and
to
us
that
suggests
that
if
a
defendant
is
to
obtain
the
names
of
perspective
witnesses,
he
must
make
some
special
showing
that
that
is
necessary
to
help
him
prepare
his
defense.
he
is
not
routinely
entitled
to
that
information
because
it
does
expose
the
witnesses
to
potential
harassment
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
since
the
function
of
bill
of
particulars
is
to
enable
the
defendant
to
prepare
his
defense
without
fear
of
undue
surprise.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
rationale
would
permit
the
courts,
permit
a
district
court
under
the
rubric
of
bill
of
particular
to
compel
complete
discovery,
the
purpose
of
discovery.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no.
well,
i
think
it
could
be
defended
as
a
legitimate
extension
of
the
existing
rules,
but
i
think
the
court
has
declined
to
make
those
--
i
note
in
this
respect
--
i
should
point
out
that
the
advisory
committee's
note
to
the
revised
rule
7
(f),
the
bill
of
particulars
note,
mentions
what
it
calls
a
wise
use
of
the
district
judge's
discretion
in
granting
bills
of
particulars
by
mr.
justice
whittaker
then
a
district
judge
in
the
smith
case
and
there
judge
whittaker
while
disclosing
--
while
directing
government
to
disclose
various
facets
of
its
case,
declined
to
direct
the
furnishing
of
a
list
of
witnesses.
and
again
the
champions
of
liberalized
criminal
discovery
during
the
period
of
this
rule's
revision
urged
the
revisers
to
make
avail
--
to
require
or
authorize
a
witness
list,
again
to
allow
the
defendant
to
talk
to
the
witnesses
even
if
not
perhaps
to
depose
again
it
was
rejected.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
i
think
the
bill
of
particular,
in
a
system
in
which
you
have
no
discovery
or
a
very
limited
discovery,
a
bill
of
particulars
is
necessary
to--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
right
it
is
to
furnish
some
additional
information
to
enable
them
to
--
here
i
mention--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
to
furnish
necessary
information
beyond
the
indictment
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
to
prepare
a
defense,
correct.
i
mentioned
that
in
this
case
the
government
did
disclose
in
answer
to
the
request
for
particulars,
a
very
large
amount
of
information,
including
for
example
the
specific
items
of
receipt,
which
the
government
contends
were
fraudulently
not
reported
on
the
income
tax
return
and
the
names
of
customers
who
will
testify
that
their
payments
to
the
defendant
were
not
reported.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
any
individual.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
that
the
breadth
of
that
is
certainly
an
additional
distressing
factor.
i
don't
know
whether
in
this
particular
case,
there's
such
an
individual,
an
informant
we
would
want
to
be
using
in
the
future.
again
our
position
mean
that
the
burden
of
showing
the
special
circumstances
is
the
defendant's
rather
than
the
government's.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
in
the
civil
sphere
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
right,
yes
i
was
going
to
suggest
that
in
both
areas,
mandamus
has
been
regarded
as
proper
only
in
exceptional
circumstances,
and
the
circumstances
here
that
we
view
as
exceptional
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
think
the
judge's
order
was
in
march,
the
actual
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
initial
order
to
grant
particulars
was
in
october
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
then
proceedings
in
the
district
court
concerning
this
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yeah.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
i'm
just
suggesting
after
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
i
assume
that
if
the
government
brought
a
mandamus
proceeding
that
had
no
reasonable
foundation
and
that
it
was
a
tactic
of
delay
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
trial
court
would
prevent
the
government
from
thereafter
going
forward
with
the
trial.
there
are
i
think
ample
protective
devices
to
prevent
tactics
of
delay.
in
the
government's
view,
these
mandamus
proceedings
are
appropriate
only
in
very
unusual
cases.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
but
mr.
chief
justice
if
we
alleged,
if
we
made
such
an
--
if
we
brought
a
frivolous
mandamus
proceeding,
i
should
think
it
would
be
fully
appropriate
for
the
district
court
to
dismiss
the
indictment
for
failure
to
prosecute
or
for
denial
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
i
don't
think
there's,
i
don't
think
there
is
a
danger
that
the
government
were
still
minded
would
be
permitted
to
abuse
this
device
in
order
to
delay
criminal
trials.
the
number
of
cases
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
of
course
there
are
ways
that
that
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan
i
suggested
that
probably
there
is
no
appeal
from
a
dismissal
of
an
indictment
that
does
not,
is
not,
does
not
rest
on
the
invalidity
of
the
indictment.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
few
moments
that
remain,
i’d
like
to
address
myself
briefly
to
the
jurisdictional
issue
here,
which
has
to
do
with
the
scope
of
the
power
of
court
of
appeals
to
issue
writs
of
mandamus
in
federal,
criminal
cases
at
the
behest
of
the
government.
we
sense
some
ambiguity,
some
contradiction
in
the
argument
that
petitioner
has
made
here.
on
the
one
hand,
he
suggests
that
because
the
government
ordinarily
cannot
appeal
an
adverse
judgment
in
a
criminal
case,
therefore
for
the
government
to
seek
mandamus
is
not
a
--
not
properly
to
invoke
the
appellate
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals.
now
just
two
terms
ago
on
the
dean
foods
case,
in
384
u.s,
the
court
made
quite
clear
that
even
in
a
situation
where
the
only
right
of
appeal
is
that
of
a
private
individual
that
was
a
case
of
a
respondent
before
the
federal
trade
commission,
the
government
may
still
in
an
appropriate
case
ask
for
mandamus.
so
the
test
of
whether
a
writ
is
appropriately
in
aid
of
appellate
jurisdiction
is
whether
some
party
to
the
proceeding
at
some
point
has
a
right
of
appeal.
now
while
making
this
argument,
petitioner
at
the
same
time
appears
to
concede
the
validity
of
a
series
of
cases
in
this
court,
the
ex
parte
united
states
cases
and
two
others,
in
which
the
government
in
criminal
cases
was
allowed
to
obtain
a
writ
of
mandamus.
the
test
petitioner
suggests
is
that,
that
is
perhaps
proper
where
it
is
necessary
to
enable
the
government
to
place
the
man
on
trial
or
to
impose
a
sentence,
but
were
denied
the
power
in
every
other
case.
this
seems
to
us
to
lead
to
highly
anomalous
results
and
an
example
may
make
this
clear.
suppose
that
judge
will
adopted
the
practice
in
his
courtroom
of
permitting
the
defendant
to
subpoena
and
depose
all
government
witnesses
routinely
just
as
in
a
civil
case,
it’s
quite
clear
that
the
federal
criminal
rules
do
not
afford
the
same
discovery
powers
as
the
federal
civil
rules,
and
that
indeed
this
court
in
revising
these
criminal
rules
from
time
to
time
has
declined
to
assimilate
the
civil
and
criminal
proceeding
in
this
respect.
though
--
now
the
logic
of
petitioner’s
position
is
that
however
patent
and
extreme
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
pardon?
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
think
when
the
court
is
urged
as
it
has
been
urged
to
broaden
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
it
is
the
court
that
promulgates
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
the
rules
and
i
assume
approves
the
work
of
the
committee
when
it
adopts
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
agree,
perhaps
i
should
not
say
it
was
the
court
that
declined,
but
whoever
should
take
responsibility
for
the
federal
criminal
rules,
they
do
impose,
they
do
define
federal
district
judge’s
power
in
criminal
cases.
it
seems
to
us
that
in
cases
where
federal
district
judges
persistently
or
blatantly
ignore
these
rules
there
must
be
a
remedy
for
assuring
compliance.
the
rules
are
promulgated
to
have
uniform
application
throughout
the
federal
court
systems
and
it
seems
to
us
intolerable
that
every
federal
judge
could
be
a
law
unto
himself
in
these
procedural
questions.
again,
i
sense
an
element
of
contradiction
here
in
petitioner’s
argument
because
he
recognizes
that
there
are
cases
where
the
u.s.
attorney
might
simply
refuse
to
comply
with
the
district
court’s
order
and
the
district
judge
would
adjudge
him
in
contempt
and
an
appeal
would
then
lie.
so
he
does
recognize
the
contempt
proceedings
at
least
as
an
escape
valve
by
which
the
courts
of
appeals
can
review
district
judge’s
procedural
rulings.
it
seems
to
us
furthermore
orderly
procedure
to
recognize
a
mandamus
remedy
in
this
class
of
cases.
we
don’t
suggest
that
this
is
all
cases
or
most
cases
where
the
government
feels
there
is
error
in
a
district
court
ruling,
but
only
those
unusual
cases,
which
either
present
a
novel
issue
or
show
a
clear
case
of
persistent
refusal
to
comply
by
the
district
court
with
these
requirements.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well
the
district
judge
as
he
stated
in
one
of
the
colloquies
in
this
case
at
page,
i
believe
at
page
95
--
page
75
of
the
record,
admits
that
it
is
his
consistent
practice
in
all
criminal
cases
to
require
this
list
of
witnesses.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well
i
would
say
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
i
don’t,
i
can't
agree
with
that.
i
think
it
is
certainly
relevant
if
a
judge
has
not
once
but
persistently
adopted
a
practice
which
appears
to
be
in
conflict
with
the
rules.
mandamus
is
an
extraordinary
remedy.
it
is
far
more
appropriately
employed,
it
seems
to
us,
where
there
is
a
consistent
pattern
applying
to
many
cases
and
not
simply
what
could
be
viewed
as
isolated
error.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
mandamus
has
been
viewed,
i
don’t
know
that
i
would
use
the
word
discipline,
but
in
a
private
case
like
the
la
buy
case,
when
this
court
said
that
judge
la
buy
--
issued
a
writ
of
mandamus
against
judge
la
buy
because
he
was
referring
cases
to
masters
in
circumstances
which
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
no,
but
the
court
stated
that
judge,
that
in
the
district
in
question,
this
had
been
a
frequent
practice
and
the
court
viewed
this
as
distinctly
relevant
to
the
propriety
of
the
--
of
intervening
in
district
court
procedures.
the
fact
that
there
has
been
a
consistent
non-compliance
with
the
rules.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
don’t
suggest
that
the
sole
reason
why
the
government
declined
to
comply
with
the
judge’s
order
was
that
he
had
issued
similar
orders
in
the
past.
i
think
it’s
also
felt
that
there
is
an
important
principle
here
as
to
the
scope
of
discovery
a
criminal
case,
which
is
appropriately
decided
by
the
appellate
courts
rather
than
by
judge
will’s
and
when
i
resume
tomorrow
i
will
consider
what
it
is
about
this
practice
that
in
our
view
requires
correction.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
afternoon
the
discussion
centered
on
the
jurisdictional
issue
relating
to
the
powers
of
the
courts
of
appeals
to
issue
writs
of
mandamus
at
the
behest
of
the
government
in
criminal
cases.
and
unless
there
are
further
questions
on
that
phase
of
the
case,
i'd
like
to
turn
my
attention
to
the
issue
on
the
merits,
and
that
is
the
propriety
of
judge
will's
ruling
in
this
case
that
the
government
must
turn
over
to
the
defense,
a
list
of
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
individuals
to
whom
the
defendant
had
made
statements
relating
to
the
crime.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
address
myself
to
that
question.
petitioner's
counsel
mentioned
the
apex
case,
which
does
--
a
ninth
circuit
case
i
believe,
which
holds
that
the
only,
the
government
may
only
appeal
the
dismissal
of
an
indictment
when
the
reason
for
the
dismissal
has
to
do
with
the
validity
of
the
indictment.
while
the
issue
has
not
been
authoritatively
resolved
by,
has
not
been
addressed
by
this
court,
i
think
the
government
at
least
tacitly
accepts
the
apex
principle
and
would
not
attempt
to
appeal
a
dismissal
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
judge's
order.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
correct,
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
you
mean
in
terms
of
direct
appeal
to
this
court?
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
that
would
only
be
where
the
issues
are
of
statutory
construction.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
but
even
there
the,
there
is
this
view
that
no
appeal
lies
unless
the
validity
of
the
indictment
itself
is
questioned.
now,
to
us
the
essential
point
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
judge
will's
ruling
is
that
the
federal
criminal
rule
simply
do
not
contain
any
authority
for
this
kind
of
disclosure
of
the
government's
case.
now,
two
years
ago
when
the
federal
rules
were
extensively
revised
in
this
area
of
discovery,
it
was
urged
upon
the
revisers
that
many
of
the
principles
of
civil
discovery
be
carried
into
the
criminal
sphere,
and
specifically
that
a
list
of
witnesses
that
the
government
intended
to
call
be
furnished
to
the
defense
in
advance
of
trial
and
the
revisers
declined
to
make
that
change
and
you
will
find
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
think
i
believe
that's
how
it
read,
but
i
think
that
judge
will
has
adopted
a
policy
of
routinely
making
this
information
available
to
the
defense
rather
than
requiring
any
showing
of
particular
need
on
the
part
of
the
defense.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
we
contend
that
the
order
is
erroneous
insofar
as
it
does
reflect
a
practice
of
routinely
making
--
ordering
these
disclosures
without
regard
to
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
case.
had
judge
will
found
something
special
in
the
facts
here,
had
the
defense
argued
that
there
was
something
special
in
the
facts
here,
which
required
disclosure
of
this
information
that
would
be
a
different
case.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
without
reopening
that
issue
completely,
i
note
that
in
the
la
buy
case
in
352
united
states,
a
major
statement
of
this
court
as
to
the
function
of
mandamus,
the
court
in
noting
that
mandamus
should
be
resorted
to
only
in
extreme
cases
went
on
to
say,
and
i'm
quoting
the
supreme
court,
“there
is
an
end
of
patience
and
it
clearly
appears
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
for
years
admonished
the
trial
judges
of
the
seventh
circuit
that
the
practice
of
making
references
does
not
commend
itself.
and
the
court
goes
on
to
point
out
that
in
1942
and
subsequent
occasions
the
court
had
rebuked,
court
of
appeals
had
rebuked
the
district
court.
it
emphasizes
the
fact
that
the
particular
judge
involved
in
that
case
had
referred
11
cases
to
masters
in
the
past
six
years.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well
judge
will
himself
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
judge
will
states
in
one
of
the
colloquies
in
this
case,
and
this
is
in
the
record
that
is,
this
is
perhaps
the
50th
time
in
which
he
has
had
occasion
to
make
this
kind
of
order
of
disclosure,
which
the
government
views
as
unauthorized
and
we
think
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
but
i
think
the
essential
point
is
that
in
judge
will's
view
of
this
area,
he
does
not
require
that
any
special
reason
to
be
shown
for
this
kind
disclosure.
he
regards
this
as
a
routine
matter
that
anyone
who
has
been
present
either
at
the
commission
of
the
crime
or
when
the
defendant
was
talking
about
the
crime
has
a
right
to
--
that
all
those
names
must
be
disclosed
and
as
i
say
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
i
believe
it
is
contrary.
the
only
basis
in
the
federal
rules
for
disclosure
of
a
witness'
name
is
if
it
is
necessary
to
comply
with
a
proper
request
for
a
bill
of
particular.
there's
no
discovery
mechanism
as
such
by
which
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
the
cases
which
petitioner
cites,
number
of
cases
for
the
proposition
that
this
a
common
practice
almost
invariably
concern
the
situation
that
was
presented
in
the
roviaro
case
where
the
crime
itself
has,
the
--
an
essential
participant
in
the
crime
has
been
a
government
informant.
government
informant
has
purchased
the
narcotics
or
has
furnished
the
stolen
property
to
the
defendant.
in
those
circumstances
where
the
informant,
the
government
witnesses
at
the
very
center
of
the
crime
itself,
many
courts
have
made
that
name
available
to
the
defense.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
we
view
it
as,
apart
from
any
function
it
may
have
with
relation
to
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
its
purpose
is
to
enable
the
defense,
to
the
defendant
to
prepare
defense
and
present
a
defense
without
unfair
surprise.
that
has
been
held
to
require
that
if,
for
example,
as
in
the
roviaro
case,
the
indictment
states
that
the
crime
is
the
sale
of
narcotics
to
john
doe,
not
otherwise
identified
the
name
of
that
witness,
of
that
not
necessarily
witness,
the
name
of
that
participant
in
the
crime
should
be
available
to
the
defendant
at
least
in
some
cases,
so
that
he
can
prepare
a
defense.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
talking
to
him
or
interviewing
him,
or
perhaps
to
find
out
what
actual
circumstances
there
were.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
i
think
the
roviaro
rule
and
other
decisions,
which
have
authorized
disclosure,
strike
a
balance
between
two
significant
interests.
one
is
the
defendant's
interest
in
preparing
his
case
and
the
other,
a
very
important
interest
in
the
government's
view,
is
that
of
the
confidentially
of
informants.
now
in
this
--
in
a
case
like
this
the
issue
arises
in
this
fashion,
in
intern--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
this
is
not,
the
problem
here
is
not
that
of
the
informant
that
the
government
wants
to
keep
confidential
for
use
in
subsequent
cases
nor
is
the
problem
a,
the
kind
of
problem
which
the
government
can
ordinarily
furnish
special
reason.
the
problem
is
this
in
internal
revenue
case,
that
very
often
the
government
learns
violations
of
the
income
tax
laws
through
friends,
or
acquaintances,
or
former
employees,
or
other
associates
of
the
defendant,
who
come
forward
with
this
information
either
out
of
public
sense
of
public
duty
or
because
there
is
a
bounty
for
this
kind
of
information.
now
these
people
then
will
often
furnish
not
only
lease,
but
very
important
evidence
of
admissions
at
the
trial,
evidence
which
is
highly
material
on
the
issue
of
willfulness.
if
a
person
has
been
bragging
to
his
friend
or
acquaintance
that
his
skill
in
outwitting
the
internal
revenue
service,
that
individual's
testimony
of
this
admission
will
be
highly
material
in
adjudging
the
willfulness
of
the
violation.
now
if
the
names
of
those
individuals
are
available
to
the
defendant,
there
is
a
danger
which
the
service
believes
is
a
substantial
one,
that
the
defendant
will
appeal
directly
or
indirectly
to
the
friendship
or
sympathy
of
these
individuals
or
in
some
cases
there
maybe
elements
of
bribery
involved
to
shade
the
testimony
or
to
develop
a
lapse
of
memory
when
it
comes
to
the
trial
or
otherwise
change
their
testimony.
this
is
a
--
dangers
of
this
sort
are
the
historical
reason
why
discovery
in
criminal
cases
has
been
very
limited,
the
fear
that--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
this
is
a
tax
fraud
case.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
danger
of
which
i
am
speaking
here
is
not
the
danger
of
rubbing
out
witnesses,
that
is
a
danger
in
another
areas,
the
narcotics
area,
it
is
a
danger
of
distortion
and
fabrication
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
i
am
talking
rubbing
out
in
–
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--the
tax
context
i
am
talking
of--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
they
are
not
likely
to
be
aware
of
what
--
assuming
that
the
defendant
has
made
statements,
admissions
to
a
number
of
people,
he
will
not
know
whether
they
are
going
to
testify
against
him,
whether
they
turned
state's
evidence
or
anything
of
that
sort.
now
the
distinction
has
been
urged,
continues
to
be
urged
between
civil
and
criminal
cases
in
this
regard
on
the
basis
of
the
greater
stakes
from
the
defendant
standpoint
in
a
criminal
case.
but
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
this
is
a
correct
view,
that
it
should
be
paramount
to
the
defendant's
right
to
prepare
a
defense.
but
all
these
issues
were
laid
before
the
revisers
of
the
criminal
rules
two
years
ago,
the
same
argument
i
am
suggesting
here
was
made
and
the
court
or
the
advisory
committee
in
congress
declined
to
establish
any
broad
rule
of
discovery.
and
to
us
that
suggests
that
if
a
defendant
is
to
obtain
the
names
of
perspective
witnesses,
he
must
make
some
special
showing
that
that
is
necessary
to
help
him
prepare
his
defense.
he
is
not
routinely
entitled
to
that
information
because
it
does
expose
the
witnesses
to
potential
harassment
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
since
the
function
of
bill
of
particulars
is
to
enable
the
defendant
to
prepare
his
defense
without
fear
of
undue
surprise.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
rationale
would
permit
the
courts,
permit
a
district
court
under
the
rubric
of
bill
of
particular
to
compel
complete
discovery,
the
purpose
of
discovery.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no.
well,
i
think
it
could
be
defended
as
a
legitimate
extension
of
the
existing
rules,
but
i
think
the
court
has
declined
to
make
those
--
i
note
in
this
respect
--
i
should
point
out
that
the
advisory
committee's
note
to
the
revised
rule
7
(f),
the
bill
of
particulars
note,
mentions
what
it
calls
a
wise
use
of
the
district
judge's
discretion
in
granting
bills
of
particulars
by
mr.
justice
whittaker
then
a
district
judge
in
the
smith
case
and
there
judge
whittaker
while
disclosing
--
while
directing
government
to
disclose
various
facets
of
its
case,
declined
to
direct
the
furnishing
of
a
list
of
witnesses.
and
again
the
champions
of
liberalized
criminal
discovery
during
the
period
of
this
rule's
revision
urged
the
revisers
to
make
avail
--
to
require
or
authorize
a
witness
list,
again
to
allow
the
defendant
to
talk
to
the
witnesses
even
if
not
perhaps
to
depose
again
it
was
rejected.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
i
think
the
bill
of
particular,
in
a
system
in
which
you
have
no
discovery
or
a
very
limited
discovery,
a
bill
of
particulars
is
necessary
to--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
right
it
is
to
furnish
some
additional
information
to
enable
them
to
--
here
i
mention--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
to
furnish
necessary
information
beyond
the
indictment
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
to
prepare
a
defense,
correct.
i
mentioned
that
in
this
case
the
government
did
disclose
in
answer
to
the
request
for
particulars,
a
very
large
amount
of
information,
including
for
example
the
specific
items
of
receipt,
which
the
government
contends
were
fraudulently
not
reported
on
the
income
tax
return
and
the
names
of
customers
who
will
testify
that
their
payments
to
the
defendant
were
not
reported.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
any
individual.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
that
the
breadth
of
that
is
certainly
an
additional
distressing
factor.
i
don't
know
whether
in
this
particular
case,
there's
such
an
individual,
an
informant
we
would
want
to
be
using
in
the
future.
again
our
position
mean
that
the
burden
of
showing
the
special
circumstances
is
the
defendant's
rather
than
the
government's.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
in
the
civil
sphere
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
right,
yes
i
was
going
to
suggest
that
in
both
areas,
mandamus
has
been
regarded
as
proper
only
in
exceptional
circumstances,
and
the
circumstances
here
that
we
view
as
exceptional
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
think
the
judge's
order
was
in
march,
the
actual
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
initial
order
to
grant
particulars
was
in
october
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
then
proceedings
in
the
district
court
concerning
this
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yeah.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
i'm
just
suggesting
after
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
i
assume
that
if
the
government
brought
a
mandamus
proceeding
that
had
no
reasonable
foundation
and
that
it
was
a
tactic
of
delay
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
trial
court
would
prevent
the
government
from
thereafter
going
forward
with
the
trial.
there
are
i
think
ample
protective
devices
to
prevent
tactics
of
delay.
in
the
government's
view,
these
mandamus
proceedings
are
appropriate
only
in
very
unusual
cases.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
but
mr.
chief
justice
if
we
alleged,
if
we
made
such
an
--
if
we
brought
a
frivolous
mandamus
proceeding,
i
should
think
it
would
be
fully
appropriate
for
the
district
court
to
dismiss
the
indictment
for
failure
to
prosecute
or
for
denial
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
i
don't
think
there's,
i
don't
think
there
is
a
danger
that
the
government
were
still
minded
would
be
permitted
to
abuse
this
device
in
order
to
delay
criminal
trials.
the
number
of
cases
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
of
course
there
are
ways
that
that
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan
i
suggested
that
probably
there
is
no
appeal
from
a
dismissal
of
an
indictment
that
does
not,
is
not,
does
not
rest
on
the
invalidity
of
the
indictment.
