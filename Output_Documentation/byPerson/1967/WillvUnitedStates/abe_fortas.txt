justice
abe
fortas
well
isn’t
there
another
theory
and
that
is
that
the
appellate
court
has
jurisdiction
by
way
of
mandamus,
as
jurisdiction
a
way
of
mandamus
to
review
decisions
of
the
lower
court
as
an
interlocutory
matter
provided
that
those
decisions
would
be
ultimately
reviewable,
would
be
ultimately
reviewable
by
the
appellate
court
and
that
unless
review
on
an
interlocutory
basis,
reviewability,
the
exercise
of
the
reviewed
jurisdiction
might
be
destroyed.
justice
abe
fortas
because
i
–
it’s
little
surprising
for
me
to
hear
you
say
that
the
theory
to
advance,
the
theory
or
argument
purposes
that
your
adversaries’
position
would
mean
that
every
interlocutory
decision
could
be
reviewed
because
there
are
some
decisions
that
just
aren’t
reviewable
at
any
time.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
it’s
much
simpler
theory,
i
haven’t
you
heard
mention
it
and
that’s
why
i
take
the
liberty
to
interrupting
you.
the
theory
that
i
believe
is
advanced
and
some
of
the
literature
anyway,
is
that
if
a
decision
would
be
ultimately
reviewable
by
the
appellate
court,
if
it’s
--
and
if
the
failure
to
review
it
on
an
interlocutory
basis
would
destroy
the
possibility
of
effective
review,
then
the
appellate
court
has
jurisdiction
to
review
it
by
means
of
mandamus.
justice
abe
fortas
i’m
not
suggesting
that’s
the
right
principle,
but
it’s
in
your
very
careful
statement
to
this
point
that’s
the
principle
that
you’ve
not
mentioned?
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
know
that
district
judges
never
make
very
extreme
errors
but
just
suppose
one
did,
suppose
for
example,
one
ordered
the
secretary
of
defense
to
produce
all
of
the
secret
information
relating
to
the
conduct
of
a
war
or
something
like
that.
now,
what
you’re
saying
is
then
the
only
possibilities
are
the
government
produces
the
information
or
the
government
dismisses
the
indictment
and
doesn't
prosecute.
we
would
exclude
even
in
case
of
a
plain,
extreme
abuse
by
the
district
court
the
possibility
of
mandamus,
is
that
right?
that
is
your
position.
justice
abe
fortas
the
decision
to
dismiss
or
to
hold
for
contempt
is
entirely
up
to
a
district
judge,
is
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
well
we
haven’t
done
it.
justice
abe
fortas
we
haven’t
done
it.
that’s
different
from
saying
we
have
declined
to
do
it,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
when
the
committees
have
been
urged.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it's
alright.
i
do
think
there
is
an
important
shade
of
difference
between
what
the
situation
is
on
the
standing
and
what
is
reflected
by
your
word,
“decline.”
justice
abe
fortas
well
what's
--
does
that
have
any
role
in
this
case?
is
this
case
brought
by
the
government,
over
and
part
because
the
district
judge
has
a
bad
record?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand,
but
when
you
get
around
your
argument
i'd
like
to
know
why
the
government
in
this
particular
case
deemed
that,
sufficiently
consequential
to
decline
to
obey
the
order
of
the
judge
and
turn
over
this
information
that
the
judge
ordered
them
to
turn
over
to
the
defendant
and
that
to
me
is
a
material
fact.
justice
abe
fortas
i
doubt
very
much
that
even
the
judge’s
statement
or
matters
that
are
not
in
this
case
or
in
this
record
with
respect
to
this
judge’s
practice
or
what
wasn’t
his
practice,
play,
play
or
maybe
allowed
to
play
a
part
here?
justice
abe
fortas
does
that
also
go
for
private
litigant?
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
department
of
justice
has
available
to
it,
mandamus
as
a
measure
for
disciplining
judges,
are
you?
justice
abe
fortas
well
that
was
based
on
that
particular
case?
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
i
think
i
understand
your
position
now
and
i'm
not
sure
at
all
i
that
i
agree
with
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
posner
wasn't
that
proposal
in
terms
of
mandatory
provision
that
the
judge
shouldn't
make
that
available
unless
the
witness
is
available
with
some
exceptions
for
security
reasons
or
accepting
--
excluding
instances
where
the
judge
had
some
affirmative
reason
for
not
turning
over
particular
names
that
is
to
say
the
proposal
was
not
in
terms
of
granting
or
denying
the
judge's
discretion,
am
i
--
is
my
recollection
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
suggesting
that
the
issue
before
us
is
not
whether
it
was
ever
to
order
a
disclosure
in
this
case,
but
whether
judge
will
is
wrong
in
what
is
alleged
to
be
a
routine
practice
of
disclosing
names?
can
we
pass
on
anything
other
than
the
order
of
disclosure
in
this
particular
case?
justice
abe
fortas
well
may
i
suggest
that
your
argument
maybe
that
the
record
here
fails
to
disclose
an
adequate
reason
for
the
order
of
disclosure
in
this
particular
case.
i
must
say
to
you,
as
i
indicated
yesterday,
that
i
have
the
greatest
difficulty
in
considering
statements
to
the
effect
that
judge
ought
to
be
--
we
ought
to
use
mandamus
really
to
discipline
a
judge
with
respect
to
a
general
practice,
the
details
and
the
circumstances
of
which
we
don't
have
before
us
in
the
sense
that
they're
not
in
this
record
and
i
think
it's
a
very
serious
thing,
it's
a
very
drastic
thing
that
you're
asking
us
to
do
in
the
absence
of
what
i
would
regard
as
adequate
information?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
suggesting
that
we
have
a
comparable
basis
here?
justice
abe
fortas
that
the
court
of
appeals
--
has
the
court
of
appeals
rebuked
judge
will
in
other
cases?
has
judge
will
refused
to
comply
with
a
directive
or
an
indicated
position
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
government
views
that
but
we
don't
have
the
circumstance
before
us,
maybe
in
every
one
of
those
50
cases,
if
we
pass
the
jurisdictional
point,
beside
that
he
has
jurisdiction
into
this
so
far
as
we
know
maybe,
in
every
one
of
those
50
cases
he
had
an
adequate
and
indeed
compelling
reason
to
do
that?
justice
abe
fortas
but
then
there
is
also
the
reason
advanced
against
discovery
in
civil
cases
for
years
and
years
and
over
the
years
mr.
posner--
justice
abe
fortas
would
your
argument
apply
equally
to
a
criminal
prosecution
of
somebody
for
a
tax
fraud
or
for
securities
act
violation
or
that
sort
of
thing?
there
too
the
government
takes
the
same
position,
doesn't
it,
against
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
this
is
a
tax
fraud
case,
that's
right.
well
is
this
–
you'd
make
no
distinction
between
this
and
an
organized
crime
case?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
isn't
it
true
that
in
criminal
cases,
the
defendant
and
his
counsel
generally
know
some
of
the
witnesses
anyway
or
have
a
pretty
good
idea
as
to
who
some
of
the
witnesses
will
be.
now
has
the
department
reason
to
suspect
if
there
is
a
widespread
subordination
of
perjury
in
this
country
or
widespread
rubbing
out
of
witnesses
or
whatever--?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
whatever
you
are
talking
about—
justice
abe
fortas
okay,
now
the
other
reason
to
believe
that
presently
anything
of
that
sort
is
going
on
despite
the
obvious
fact
that
defendants
and
their
counsel
will
be
aware
of
most
of
the
witnesses
and
most
of
the
probable
witnesses
without
any
disclosure
on
your
part?
justice
abe
fortas
if
the
government
did
voluntarily
give
you
the
names
of
some
persons
who
have
knowledge
of
the
facts,
is
that
--?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
suppose
then
i'd
have
to
take
the
position
that
they
did
it
voluntarily,
they
did
it
because
they
wanted
to,
not
because
they
thought
they
were
under
legal
compulsion?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
so
what
it
come,
what
it
may
come
down
to
is
that
the
government
says
the
government
as
prosecutor
can
decide
which
names
it
will
give
you,
but
that
the
trial
judge
as
judge
does
not
have
that
power?
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
or
that,
the
second
line
is
that
in
this
particular
case
that
was
wrongly
exercised,
so
i
understand
they're
arguing
both.
justice

justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
suppose
then
i'd
have
to
take
the
position
that
they
did
it
voluntarily,
they
did
it
because
they
wanted
to,
not
because
they
thought
they
were
under
legal
compulsion?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
so
what
it
come,
what
it
may
come
down
to
is
that
the
government
says
the
government
as
prosecutor
can
decide
which
names
it
will
give
you,
but
that
the
trial
judge
as
judge
does
not
have
that
power?
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
or
that,
the
second
line
is
that
in
this
particular
case
that
was
wrongly
exercised,
so
i
understand
they're
arguing
both.
