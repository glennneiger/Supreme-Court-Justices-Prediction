mr.
posner,
you
may
continue
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
posner,
if
we
decide
with
the
government
in
this
case,
would
it
be
a
question
for
the
government
that
having
an
authority
to
have
an
appeal
whenever
it
disagrees
with
an
order
of
discovery
or
an
order
for
a
bill
of
particulars.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
tell
me
why
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
criminal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
you
would
claim,
you
could
claim
it
was
exceptional
and
cause
the
delay
to
a
trial
that
was
caused
in
this
one.
i
notice
in
this
case
that
the
court
--
the
trial
court
made
its
order
on
the
october
3
and
this
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
mandamus
came
on
october
4,
1966,
10
months
later
and
the
trial,
there
were
no
action
in
the
trial
between
those
dates.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
initial
order
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
initial
order
that
the
government
objected
to
as
i
read
the
briefs
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
is
in
--
was
in
october
1965,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
no
action
in
the
trial
after
that
and
here
the
order
of
mandamus
was
october
4,
1966
and
now
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
is
that
if
we
decide
with
the
government
in
this
case,
is
that
procedure
open
to
the
government
anytime
the
government
wants
to
allege
that
the
order
of
the
trial
court
in
discovery
or
for
a
bill
of
particulars
were
beyond
his
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yeah,
but
you'd
allege
it
was
unusual
in
the
case
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'd
have
to
review
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
in
dismissing
it,
would
we
or
do
you
say
--?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
do
you
say
that
there's
no
appeal
from
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
silets?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
nor
did
i.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i've
intended
to
ask
mr.
posner,
but
i
forgot
it,
i'll
ask
you.
what
is
there
in
this
case
that
enables
us
to
say
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
was
an
extraordinary
case
that
would
invoke
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
wondering
if
in
view
of
the
facts
of
this
case
where
on
the
original
hearing
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
same
panel
decided
in
favor
of
the
trial
judge
and
then
on
a
motion
for
rehearing
without
any
hearing
of
any
kind
reversed
itself
and
granted
the
writ
of
mandamus
without
any
opinion
if
we
have
any
fair
opportunity
here
to
appraise
the
facts
that
lead
to
that
and
i'm
wondering
if
the
proper
thing
in
this
case
wouldn't
be
to
vacate
the
judgment,
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
ask
them
to
make
the
necessary
findings
and
set
the
standards
or
what
would
constitute
proper
action
in
mandamus.
chief
justice
earl
warren
