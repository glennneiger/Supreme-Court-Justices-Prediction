may

please
court.
simmie
horwitz
is
druggist
in
chicago
and
he
was
indicted
in
two
separate
indictments
charging
him
with
an
offense
of
violation
of
section
72061
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954.
that
offense
charged
him
with
willfully
making
and
subscribing
false
corporate
tax
returns
under
the
penalty
of
perjury,
which
he
did
not
believe
to
be
true
as
to
every
material
matter.
the
petitioner
here
is
the
judge
of
the
united
states
district
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
to
whom
these
cases
were
assigned.
the
defendant
mr.
horwitz
filed
a
request
for
bill
of
particulars
to
which
the
government
objected
in
part,
claiming
it
would
constitute
a
disclosure
of
a
list
of
its
witnesses.
some
of
the
contested
particulars
were
ultimately
answered
while
another
was
ultimately
refused
by
judge
will.
remaining
particular
is
the
one
that
is
at
issue
here
and
that
was
the
court
ordering
the
government
to
furnish
to
the
defendant
the
names
and
addresses
of
non-government
persons
to
whom
or
in
whose
presence
the
defendant
made
statements
material
to
the
proceedings,
the
date
and
place
that
the
statements
were
made,
whether
written
memoranda
or
verbatim
transcripts
were
made
of
the
statements
and
if
so
whether
the
government
had
possession
of
it.
the
government
refused
to
furnish
the
particulars
persisting
in
a
claim
that
would
be
giving
a
list
of
witnesses.
judge
will
specifically
found
that
some
of
the
persons
to
be
disclosed
might
be
witnesses,
it
was
clear
that
not
all
that
remained
would
be
witnesses
nor
that
other
persons
would
not
also
be
called
to
testify.
furthermore
since
the
requests
for
the
names
of
third
persons
on
whose
oral
statements
the
government
relied
was
refused
by
judge
will,
then
the
only
disclosure
in
this
case
was
the
names
of
some
potential
witnesses.
the
government
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
a
rule
of
show
cause
was
issued
and
the
seventh
circuit
initially
held
as
follows
that
the
order
was
non-appealable
and
would
offend
the
policy
against
piecemeal
appeals
in
criminal
cases,
that
mandamus
may
not
be
used
as
a
means
of
reviewing
the
non-appealable
order,
that
federal
courts
use
mandamus
for
the
traditional
purpose
of
confining
a
district
court
to
a
lawful
exercise
of
its
jurisdiction
or
to
compel
it
to
exercise
its
proper
jurisdiction.
and
that
finally
that
judge
will’s
order,
they
said,
might
have
been
erroneous,
a
question
which
they
were
not
willing
to
undertake
at
the
moment,
but
the
ruling
was
within
the
court’s
jurisdiction.
on
a
petition
for
rehearing
filed
by
the
government,
the
court,
seventh
circuit
undertook
to
reconsider
its
holding,
saying
that
they
would
consider
the
merits
rather
than
to
remit
the
government
to
a
radical
alternative
judgment
available
to
the
trial
judge
upon
the
government’s
persistent
refusal
to
comply.
this
court
has
granted
certiorari
as
to
whether
the
court
of
appeals
has
jurisdiction
to
issue
a
writ
of
mandamus
to
prohibit
a
district
court
from
directing
the
government
to
furnish
request
for
bill
of
particulars
where
there
is
no
statutory
authority
for
an
appeal
by
the
government
from
such
an
order
and
where
the
district
court
has
lawfully
exercised
its
prescribed
jurisdiction.
secondly,
whether
a
court
of
appeals
can
substitute
its
discretion
for
that
of
a
district
court
by
the
issuance
of
a
writ
of
mandamus
preventing
the
district
court
from
requiring
the
government
to
furnish
a
bill
of
particulars,
which
may
disclose
in
part
the
names
of
some
perspective
witnesses.
while
the
right
of
the
government
to
appeal
in
criminal
cases
has
been
sharply
limited,
there
is
no
clear-cut
dichotomy
as
yet
drawn
to
the
government’s
right
of
review
by
mandamus
in
a
criminal
case.
the
concept
of
finality
of
judgment
is
controlling
we
say
as
a
characteristic
of
federal
procedure.
as
a
result,
piecemeal
appeals
have
been
frowned
upon
and
where
there
are
statutory
exceptions
they
are
either
by
the
language
of
the
statue
or
by
their
operation
addressed
to
civil
actions.
though
governmental
review
in
a
criminal
case
has
said
--
been
said
to
be
something
unusual
or
exceptional
or
not
favored,
still
congress
can
and
to
a
limited
extent
has
granted
review
to
the
government.
for
example,
the
criminal
appeals
act
when
there
is
actually
a
termination
prosecution;
or
the
narcotic
control
act,
where
there
is
an
appeal
from
an
order
suppressing
the
use
of
seized
narcotics,
but
this
court
has
strictly
construed
all
such
statutes.
furthermore,
this
restrictive
attitude
has
not
been
ameliorated
in
any
way
by
the
fact
that
the
government
has
no
later
right
to
appeal.
this
reluctance,
to
grant
review
to
the
government
in
a
criminal
case
is
even
more
compelling
when
mandamus
is
the
vehicle
sought
to
be
used
to
gain
the
review,
especially
so
where
the
only
affect
of
the
use
of
the
writ
would
be
to
avoid
the
congressional
policy
against
piecemeal
appeals
in
criminal
cases.
thus
we
submit
is
there
or
should
there
be
a
sharply
defined
dichotomy
between
civil
and
criminal
cases
when
considering
the
use
by
the
government
of
the
writ
of
mandamus?
we
answer
yes.
first,
the
same
factors
which
limits
the
government’s
appeals
right
in
criminal
cases
apply
to
its
right
to
use
of
mandamus.
secondly,
the
concept
inherent
in
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
speedy
trial
is
a
corollary
to
the
restrictive
view
to
governmental
use
of
mandamus
in
a
criminal
case.
we
submit
a
non-restricted
application
of
the
remedy
by
the
government
could
prolong
the
trial
at
the
pleasure
of
the
government.
now
in
this
case
it
will
be
perhaps
two
years
from
the
date
that
judge
will
entered
his
order
by
the
time
that
this
court
concludes
the
correctness
of
the
entry
of
that
order.
we
submit
as
food
for
thought
to
the
court
what
if
mr.
horwitz
had
been
in
jail
for
failure
to
make
a
bond
for
two
years.
the
third
point
in
support
of
our
position
that
there
should
be
a
sharp
dichotomy
is
that
the
government
should
be
restricted
for
the
same
reasons,
which
are
applicable
to
the
fifth
amendment
prohibition
against
double
jeopardy.
thus,
the
unlimited
resources
of
the
government
to
press
repeatedly
for
successive
reviews
of
interlocutory
orders
could
debilitate
the
defendant
both
financially
and
mentally.
finally,
in
the
last
analysis
we
suggest
that
it
becomes
a
balancing
of
the
inherent
protections
afforded
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
proceeding
against
the
rights
of
the
sovereign.
in
balance
then,
when
should
the
sovereign
have
available
the
use
of
the
extraordinary
writ
as
a
method
of
review
of
an
order
in
a
criminal
case.
we
say
clearly
not
in
a
situation
where
there
is
an
interlocutory
order,
that
is
where
there
not
been
a
termination
of
the
prosecution.
analysis
of
the
cases
that
have
come
to
this
court
in
determining
whether
mandamus
is
applicable
in
a
criminal
situation
can
be
categorized
in
two
ways.
this
court
has
permitted
the
use
the
mandamus
on
a
request
by
the
government
in
a
criminal
case
in
two
situations
where
either
the
order
effectively
deprived
the
prosecution
of
its
trial,
right
to
trial
as
permitted
by
law
or
the
order
deprived
the
prosecution
of
the
results
of
a
proper
conviction.
these
are
the
two
situations
that
we
suggest
that
should
be
the
only
instance
where
the
government
should
have
available
to
it
the
right
of
mandamus
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
refer
to
the
two
ex
parte
u.s.
cases
at
287,
241
which
is
a
1932
case.
the
242
u.s.
27
i
think
that
was
1916,
united
states
versus
mayer
235
u.s.
and
united
states
versus
smith
331
u.s.
those
are
the
four
cases,
which
if
any
rule
were
to
be
drawn
from
them,
in
terms
of
a
split
between
civil
and
criminal
cases,
are
the
ones
that
are
applicable.
in
all
of
those
cases
that
is
where
the
case
has
been
terminated,
that
is
the
government
is
kept
from
its
right
to
trial
as
permitted
by
law
or
where
the
result
of
a
conviction
is
prevented
from
the
government,
in
both
of
those
situations,
mandamus
would
not
delay
or
affect
the
conduct
of
the
criminal
case
in
the
trial
court,
either
at
trial
or
at
pretrial.
we
submit
further
that
even
if
this
court
does
not
desire
at
this
time
to
draw
this
rule
out
as
a
sharp
dichotomy
between
civil
and
criminal
cases
that
we
could
suggest
to
the
court
that
a
reading
of
the
all
writs
act
would
prevent
the
government
from
obtaining
the
use
of
mandamus
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
thus
under
the
all
writs
act,
the
title
xxviii,
section
1651,
a
court
of
appeals
may
issue
all
writs
necessary
or
appropriate
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction
and
agreeable
to
the
usages
and
principles
of
law.
this
court
has
said
that
the
use
of
the
writ
has
been
applied
to
confine
an
inferior
court
to
a
lawful
exercise
of
its
prescribed
jurisdiction
or
to
compel
it
to
exercise
its
authority
when
it’s
its
duty
to
do
so.
now,
if
you’ll
read
the
all
writs
act
as
conferring
the
right
of
a
court
of
appeals
to
issue
the
writ
of
mandamus
where
it’s
appropriate,
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction,
where
it
thus
confronted
with
this
proposition.
how
it
could
that
be
in
aid
of
its
appellate
jurisdiction
when
the
person,
the
participant,
the
litigant
seeking
the
use
of
it
is
the
government
in
a
criminal
case,
and
since
the
government
has
a
limited
right
to
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
would
not
have
an
appellate
jurisdiction.
this
kind
of
reasoning
we
submit
was
the
reasoning
that
was
followed
by
the
second
circuit
in
the
united
states
versus
bondy
where
the
second
circuit
refused
to
issue
the
writ
to
the
government
to
grant
a
bill
of
particulars,
to
review
a
grant
of
bill
of
particulars
holding
that
it
had
no
actual
or
potential
jurisdiction
to
review
the
order
and
since
the
writ
was
in
aid
of
appellate
jurisdiction,
it
should
not
be
granted.
now,
a
different
viewpoint
has
been
followed
for
example
by
the
first
circuit
in
in
re
u.s.,
348
f.2d
624.
that
circuit
said
we
will
interpret
the
all
writs
section
that
is
in
aid
of
appellate
jurisdiction
and
what
i
have
suggested
in
our
brief
on
a
what
could
happen
philosophy
or
perhaps
a
chamber
of
horrors’
idea
if
the
government
refused
to
furnish
the
bill
of
particulars,
this
philosophy
would
hold
the
--
assistant
united
states
attorney
could
be
held
in
contempt
of
court
and
from
that
holding
of
contempt
could
go
up
on
appeal.
therefore,
theoretically
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
appellate
jurisdiction
and
therefore
the
writ
would
issue
in
aid
of
it.
or
in
the
alternative,
the
government
in
its
persistent
refusal
would
find
itself
with
a
dismissed
indictment
and
from
that
dismissal
of
the
indictment
perhaps
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
a
right
to
review
and
therefore
it
has
appellate
jurisdiction
and
therefore
the
writ
is
an
aid
of
the
appellate
jurisdiction.
apparently
it
is
this,
what
could
happen
philosophy,
which
prompted
the
seventh
circuit
to
reconsider
its
original
holding
when
it
said
it
would
reconsider
rather
than
remit
the
government
to
a
radical
alternative
appealable
judgment
available
to
the
trial
judge
upon
the
government’s
persistent
refusal
to
comply.
that
is
apparently
what
they
were
saying
that
this
is
the
only
--
we
don’t
want
to
submit
the
government
to
being
held
in
contempt
or
possible
dismissal
of
the
indictment
and
therefore
on
the
theory
that
what
could
happen,
we
would
have
appellate
jurisdiction
let’s
review
it.
but
to
accept
this
philosophy,
this
theory
would
also
ensure
the
proposition
that
appellate
jurisdiction
could
issue
on,
would
exist
on
the
issuance
of
any
order
and
the
writ
could
issue
as
a
result
of
any
order.
this
we
submit
is
contrary
to
the
ordered
judicial
process,
which
the
prohibition
against
piecemeal
appeals
is
meant
to
protect.
this
court
said
in
bankers
life
and
casualty
versus
holland,
if
we
applied
the
reasoning
advance
then
every
interlocutory
order,
which
is
wrong,
might
be
reviewed
under
the
all
writs
act.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
don’t
--
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
but
if
you
accept
the
philosophy
that
what
could
happen
as
a
result
of
a
persistent
refusal
to
comply
with
the
court’s
order
as
a
basis
for
ascertaining
whether
there
is
appellate
jurisdiction
then
you
could,
then
the
appeals
court
could
always
sit
back
and
say
well
they
could
always
be
held
in
contempt.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
yes.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
that
is
a
proposition
that
has
been
advanced
but
there’s
also
a
proposition
that
has
been
advanced
that
the
fact
that
the
action
may
--
for
failure
to
grant
the
writ
may
result
in
a
delay
by
virtue
of
causing
the
case
to
go
to
trial
and
causing
a
great
deal
of
expense
itself
is
not
enough
to
warrant
the
issuance
of
the
writ.
we
suggest
that
there’s
enough
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
determine
whether
the
writ
should
issue,
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
it
has
jurisdiction
but
we
suggest
that
this
court
should
now
assimilate
all
of
these
cases
and
say
clearly
in
a
criminal
situation
that
there’s
this
dichotomy.
so
that
the
government
would
be
restricted
in
approaching
a
court
of
appeals
in
a
--
from
an
order
of
--
an
interlocutory
order
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
our
first
position
is
that
there
should
be
a
clear
rule
between
criminal
and
civil
cases
and
that
if
the
government
felt
strongly
enough
in
the
situation
that
you
have
advanced
mr.
justice
fortas,
they
could
do
probably
what
was
done
in
bowman
dairy
and
that
was
refuse
to
comply
with
the
order
and
hold
itself
available
for
contempt
citation
and
that’s
what
happened
there,
and
gained
the
review.
but
we
don’t,
in
the
ultimate
we
don’t
go
that
far
for
purposes
of
decision
in
this
case
because
in
the
ultimate
even
if
this
court
does
not
wish
to
accept
a
dichotomy
between
civil
and
criminal
cases
and
you
accept
and
persist
in
a
view
of
the
rule
in
civil
cases
that
is
whether
there’s
a
clear
abuse
of
discretion,
which
might
be
the
proposition
that
you
have
advanced
that
there’s
certainly
a
clear
abuse
of
discretion
that
that
test
in
these
circumstances
would
not
warrant
the
issuance
of
the
writ.
now
the
--
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
yes.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
we
say
no
–
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
--
that
the
united
states
versus
apex
distributing
would
prevent
–
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
no
appeal,
no.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
that’s
right
but
that
is
not
of
a
significant
factor
because
in
dibella
versus
united
states
on
a
pre-indictment
motion
to
suppress
this
court
said
the
fact
that
the
government
can’t
appeal
does
not
change
the
circumstances
at
all.
the
fact
that
government
may
not
have
a
right
of
appeal
to
review
this
order
is
not
a
criterion
to
judge
whether
the
writ
should
issue
because
i
submit
this
mr.
justice
stewart
if
the
philosophy
of
the
government
here
is
accepted
then
in
the
dibella
situation
they
could
go
up
on
a
writ
of
mandamus.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
yes
it
is.
i
see
that
i
have
just
a
few
moments
remaining.
i
would
like
to
say
this
that
the
government
seems
to
urge
that
they
would
accept
the
philosophy
that
in
a
routine
ruling
the
writ
should
not
issue,
they
have
not
advised
the
court
what
they
consider
to
be
a
routine
ruling.
they
have
suggested
that
what
should
be
accepted
is
this
civil
case
test
citing
schlagenhauf
versus
holder,
and
la
buy
versus
howes
leather
company,
if
the
court
overlooks
the
dichotomy
between
civil
and
criminal
cases
and
if
the
court
does
not
feel
that
the
all
writs
act
is
restrictive
by
virtue
of
appellate
jurisdiction
philosophy,
then
we
submit
that
even
under
the
civil
test
of
schlagenhauf
and
la
buy
which
when
reduced
to
their
ultimate
is
not
–
are
nothing
more
than
a
question
of
whether
there
was
a
clear
abuse
of
discretion
that
under
that
test,
this
court,
judge
will
did
not
clearly
abuse
his
discretion.
he
had
the
jurisdiction
and
it’s
not
contested
that
he
has
jurisdiction
to
enter
an
order
requiring
a
disclosure
of
bill
of
particulars.
in
this
particular
case,
the
court
should
remember
that
the
nature
of
the
offense,
that
is
a
violation
of
72061
is
in
effect
a
written
perjury,
making
and
subscribing
a
false
tax
return
under
penalties
of
perjury
where
he
did
not
believe
everything
to
be
true.
the
nature
of
the
bill
of
particulars
was
statements
made
that
the
government
is
going
to
rely
upon
made
to
third
persons
and
who
are
those
third
persons?
now
it
would
appear
from
judge
will’s
finding
and
his
specific
ruling
here
that
in
the
nature
of
this
case,
in
the
nature
of
these
circumstances
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
and
was
required
to
receive
this
information
to
prevent
undue
surprise
and
prepare
his
defense.
therefore
we
suggest
under
any
of
these
tests,
the
dichotomy,
the
use
of
the
all
writ,
writ
section
or
finally
under
the
civil
case
test
that
judge
will
exercised
his
discretion
clearly
within
this
jurisdiction
and
properly.

to

and
addresses
of

to
whom
or

which
would
be

wasn’t

which
would
imply
that
they
had
to
be
witnesses
or
that
there
would
not
be
other
persons
who
might
be
witnesses
but
--
mr.
harvey

we
submit
none,
no
damage
to
the
government
at
all.
mr.
harvey
m.

that’s
all
it
was
to
it.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
in
response
to
the
inquiry
by
the
--
mr.
chief
justice,
the
petitioner
would
agree
that
in
every
instance
where
the
government
in
good
faith
felt
that
the
order
of
the
district
court,
an
interlocutory
order
was
improper
that
they
could
effectively
cause
a
delay
by
seeking
the
extraordinary
writ
of
mandamus.
we
don't
suggest
that
in
this
case
that
the
government
was
acting
in
bad
faith.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
no,
but
the
net
effect
what
has
happened
is
that
is
going
to
be
at
least
two
years
before
the
case
can
go
to
the
merits.
now
i
suggested
yesterday
what
would
happen
in
the
situation
if
the
defendant
were
imprisoned
or
waiting
in
his
trial.
the
government
has
acted
in
good
faith
here.
we
don't
suggest
to
the
contrary,
but
we
believe
that
if
this
court
fails
to
set
forth
some
standards
that
in
a
criminal
case
what
would
happen
would
be
the
opening
of
the
floodgates
as
was
stated
last
term
in
the
switzerland
cheese
case.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
first,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
was
no
opinion.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
we
don't
know
what
prompted
the
court
of
appeals
to
act
as
it
did.
secondly,
we
suggest
that
this
was
not
extraordinary
at
all.
this
court
has
consistently
said
that
the
extraordinary
writ
should
be
reserved
for
really
extraordinary
situations.
one
can
hardly
think
of
a
more
common
place
situation
than
the
granting
of
the
bill
of
particulars.
and
moreover
the
type
of
particulars
that
were
granted
here
that
is
the
disclosure
of
the
names
of
some
potential
witnesses
is
also
a
commonplace
situation.
this
court
in
at
least
two
cases
has
indicated
that
the
bill
of
particulars
was
a
method
by
which
potential
witnesses
could
be
disclosed.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
roviaro
case,
this
court
said
that
the
name
of
the
informant
could
be
obtained
by
the
use
of
the
bill
of
particulars
and
if
the
government
didn't
want
to
furnish
it,
the
recourse
of
the
court
would
be
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
not,
voluntarily
mr.
justice
fortas,
but
by
order
of
the
court
under
the
bill
of
particulars
but
it's
--
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
well,
in
light
of
this
proceeding
where
they
feel
that
they
don't
have
to
take
the
--
and
i
would
agree.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
precisely.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
i
would
agree
that
what
they're
suggesting
here
is
that
the
ultimate
decision
of
whether
the
particulars
will
be
answered
lies
with
the
government
and
not
with
the
court.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
that
is
a
possibility
mr.
chief
justice,
but
we
suggest
that
even
in
the
framework
of
the
record
as
it
stands
now,
the
nature
of
the
particular
offense
charged
that
is
that
this
is
not
a
charge
of
income
tax
evasion,
this
is
a
charge
of
willfully
making
a
false
return
under
the
penalties
of
perjury,
not
believing
the
contents
of
that
return
to
be
true.
it's
in
the
nature
of
a
written
perjury.
the
government
is
frank
to
admit
now
that
here
are
admissions
by
the
defendant
concerning
this
willfulness
reflecting
upon
the
proposition
of
whether
in
fact
he
had
perjured
himself.
we
can't
think
of
any
clear
situation
where
a
court
would
say
that
this
–
the
names
of
people
to
whom
he's
made
those
statements
in
the
framework
of
this
kind
of
case
is
not
appropriate.
this
is
the
most
appropriate
situation
in
terms
of
this
bill
of
particulars,
if
i
may
have
one
more
minute
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
in
response
to
the
inquiry
by
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
suggest
that
he's
correct
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
is
what
the
government
suggests
a
routine
here,
which
we
don't
concede,
by
mr.
–
by
judge
will
to
furnish
these
of
kind
or
particulars
is
not
the
basis
for
this
court
to
rule
in
this
case.
this
court
must
rule
within
the
framework
of
these
facts
in
this
case.
this
is
precisely
what
the
court
took
some
pains
to
do
in
la
buy
case.
in
la
buy,
this
court
went
in
precise
details
about
the
exceptional
circumstances
in
the
case
that
came
before
this
court.
we
suggest
in
the
ultimate,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
if
the
government
is
permitted
to
use
the
extraordinary
writ
in
the
situation
that
the
floodgates
would
open,
that
the
entire
trial
of
cases
and
criminal
cases
would
be
open
to
speculation,
the
defendants
would
be
hard-put
to
proceed,
that
the
government
would
have
it
within
its
power
whether
the
grant
of
--
to
answer
a
bill
of
particulars
or
not.
and
then
finally
on
the
merits
of
this
particular
case
that
judge
will
was
within
his
discretion,
within
his
jurisdiction
to
grant
the
particulars
in
question.
thank

simmie
horwitz
is
druggist
in
chicago
and
he
was
indicted
in
two
separate
indictments
charging
him
with
an
offense
of
violation
of
section
72061
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954.
that
offense
charged
him
with
willfully
making
and
subscribing
false
corporate
tax
returns
under
the
penalty
of
perjury,
which
he
did
not
believe
to
be
true
as
to
every
material
matter.
the
petitioner
here
is
the
judge
of
the
united
states
district
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
to
whom
these
cases
were
assigned.
the
defendant
mr.
horwitz
filed
a
request
for
bill
of
particulars
to
which
the
government
objected
in
part,
claiming
it
would
constitute
a
disclosure
of
a
list
of
its
witnesses.
some
of
the
contested
particulars
were
ultimately
answered
while
another
was
ultimately
refused
by
judge
will.
remaining
particular
is
the
one
that
is
at
issue
here
and
that
was
the
court
ordering
the
government
to
furnish
to
the
defendant
the
names
and
addresses
of
non-government
persons
to
whom
or
in
whose
presence
the
defendant
made
statements
material
to
the
proceedings,
the
date
and
place
that
the
statements
were
made,
whether
written
memoranda
or
verbatim
transcripts
were
made
of
the
statements
and
if
so
whether
the
government
had
possession
of
it.
the
government
refused
to
furnish
the
particulars
persisting
in
a
claim
that
would
be
giving
a
list
of
witnesses.
judge
will
specifically
found
that
some
of
the
persons
to
be
disclosed
might
be
witnesses,
it
was
clear
that
not
all
that
remained
would
be
witnesses
nor
that
other
persons
would
not
also
be
called
to
testify.
furthermore
since
the
requests
for
the
names
of
third
persons
on
whose
oral
statements
the
government
relied
was
refused
by
judge
will,
then
the
only
disclosure
in
this
case
was
the
names
of
some
potential
witnesses.
the
government
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
a
rule
of
show
cause
was
issued
and
the
seventh
circuit
initially
held
as
follows
that
the
order
was
non-appealable
and
would
offend
the
policy
against
piecemeal
appeals
in
criminal
cases,
that
mandamus
may
not
be
used
as
a
means
of
reviewing
the
non-appealable
order,
that
federal
courts
use
mandamus
for
the
traditional
purpose
of
confining
a
district
court
to
a
lawful
exercise
of
its
jurisdiction
or
to
compel
it
to
exercise
its
proper
jurisdiction.
and
that
finally
that
judge
will’s
order,
they
said,
might
have
been
erroneous,
a
question
which
they
were
not
willing
to
undertake
at
the
moment,
but
the
ruling
was
within
the
court’s
jurisdiction.
on
a
petition
for
rehearing
filed
by
the
government,
the
court,
seventh
circuit
undertook
to
reconsider
its
holding,
saying
that
they
would
consider
the
merits
rather
than
to
remit
the
government
to
a
radical
alternative
judgment
available
to
the
trial
judge
upon
the
government’s
persistent
refusal
to
comply.
this
court
has
granted
certiorari
as
to
whether
the
court
of
appeals
has
jurisdiction
to
issue
a
writ
of
mandamus
to
prohibit
a
district
court
from
directing
the
government
to
furnish
request
for
bill
of
particulars
where
there
is
no
statutory
authority
for
an
appeal
by
the
government
from
such
an
order
and
where
the
district
court
has
lawfully
exercised
its
prescribed
jurisdiction.
secondly,
whether
a
court
of
appeals
can
substitute
its
discretion
for
that
of
a
district
court
by
the
issuance
of
a
writ
of
mandamus
preventing
the
district
court
from
requiring
the
government
to
furnish
a
bill
of
particulars,
which
may
disclose
in
part
the
names
of
some
perspective
witnesses.
while
the
right
of
the
government
to
appeal
in
criminal
cases
has
been
sharply
limited,
there
is
no
clear-cut
dichotomy
as
yet
drawn
to
the
government’s
right
of
review
by
mandamus
in
a
criminal
case.
the
concept
of
finality
of
judgment
is
controlling
we
say
as
a
characteristic
of
federal
procedure.
as
a
result,
piecemeal
appeals
have
been
frowned
upon
and
where
there
are
statutory
exceptions
they
are
either
by
the
language
of
the
statue
or
by
their
operation
addressed
to
civil
actions.
though
governmental
review
in
a
criminal
case
has
said
--
been
said
to
be
something
unusual
or
exceptional
or
not
favored,
still
congress
can
and
to
a
limited
extent
has
granted
review
to
the
government.
for
example,
the
criminal
appeals
act
when
there
is
actually
a
termination
prosecution;
or
the
narcotic
control
act,
where
there
is
an
appeal
from
an
order
suppressing
the
use
of
seized
narcotics,
but
this
court
has
strictly
construed
all
such
statutes.
furthermore,
this
restrictive
attitude
has
not
been
ameliorated
in
any
way
by
the
fact
that
the
government
has
no
later
right
to
appeal.
this
reluctance,
to
grant
review
to
the
government
in
a
criminal
case
is
even
more
compelling
when
mandamus
is
the
vehicle
sought
to
be
used
to
gain
the
review,
especially
so
where
the
only
affect
of
the
use
of
the
writ
would
be
to
avoid
the
congressional
policy
against
piecemeal
appeals
in
criminal
cases.
thus
we
submit
is
there
or
should
there
be
a
sharply
defined
dichotomy
between
civil
and
criminal
cases
when
considering
the
use
by
the
government
of
the
writ
of
mandamus?
we
answer
yes.
first,
the
same
factors
which
limits
the
government’s
appeals
right
in
criminal
cases
apply
to
its
right
to
use
of
mandamus.
secondly,
the
concept
inherent
in
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
speedy
trial
is
a
corollary
to
the
restrictive
view
to
governmental
use
of
mandamus
in
a
criminal
case.
we
submit
a
non-restricted
application
of
the
remedy
by
the
government
could
prolong
the
trial
at
the
pleasure
of
the
government.
now
in
this
case
it
will
be
perhaps
two
years
from
the
date
that
judge
will
entered
his
order
by
the
time
that
this
court
concludes
the
correctness
of
the
entry
of
that
order.
we
submit
as
food
for
thought
to
the
court
what
if
mr.
horwitz
had
been
in
jail
for
failure
to
make
a
bond
for
two
years.
the
third
point
in
support
of
our
position
that
there
should
be
a
sharp
dichotomy
is
that
the
government
should
be
restricted
for
the
same
reasons,
which
are
applicable
to
the
fifth
amendment
prohibition
against
double
jeopardy.
thus,
the
unlimited
resources
of
the
government
to
press
repeatedly
for
successive
reviews
of
interlocutory
orders
could
debilitate
the
defendant
both
financially
and
mentally.
finally,
in
the
last
analysis
we
suggest
that
it
becomes
a
balancing
of
the
inherent
protections
afforded
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
proceeding
against
the
rights
of
the
sovereign.
in
balance
then,
when
should
the
sovereign
have
available
the
use
of
the
extraordinary
writ
as
a
method
of
review
of
an
order
in
a
criminal
case.
we
say
clearly
not
in
a
situation
where
there
is
an
interlocutory
order,
that
is
where
there
not
been
a
termination
of
the
prosecution.
analysis
of
the
cases
that
have
come
to
this
court
in
determining
whether
mandamus
is
applicable
in
a
criminal
situation
can
be
categorized
in
two
ways.
this
court
has
permitted
the
use
the
mandamus
on
a
request
by
the
government
in
a
criminal
case
in
two
situations
where
either
the
order
effectively
deprived
the
prosecution
of
its
trial,
right
to
trial
as
permitted
by
law
or
the
order
deprived
the
prosecution
of
the
results
of
a
proper
conviction.
these
are
the
two
situations
that
we
suggest
that
should
be
the
only
instance
where
the
government
should
have
available
to
it
the
right
of
mandamus
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
refer
to
the
two
ex
parte
u.s.
cases
at
287,
241
which
is
a
1932
case.
the
242
u.s.
27
i
think
that
was
1916,
united
states
versus
mayer
235
u.s.
and
united
states
versus
smith
331
u.s.
those
are
the
four
cases,
which
if
any
rule
were
to
be
drawn
from
them,
in
terms
of
a
split
between
civil
and
criminal
cases,
are
the
ones
that
are
applicable.
in
all
of
those
cases
that
is
where
the
case
has
been
terminated,
that
is
the
government
is
kept
from
its
right
to
trial
as
permitted
by
law
or
where
the
result
of
a
conviction
is
prevented
from
the
government,
in
both
of
those
situations,
mandamus
would
not
delay
or
affect
the
conduct
of
the
criminal
case
in
the
trial
court,
either
at
trial
or
at
pretrial.
we
submit
further
that
even
if
this
court
does
not
desire
at
this
time
to
draw
this
rule
out
as
a
sharp
dichotomy
between
civil
and
criminal
cases
that
we
could
suggest
to
the
court
that
a
reading
of
the
all
writs
act
would
prevent
the
government
from
obtaining
the
use
of
mandamus
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
thus
under
the
all
writs
act,
the
title
xxviii,
section
1651,
a
court
of
appeals
may
issue
all
writs
necessary
or
appropriate
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction
and
agreeable
to
the
usages
and
principles
of
law.
this
court
has
said
that
the
use
of
the
writ
has
been
applied
to
confine
an
inferior
court
to
a
lawful
exercise
of
its
prescribed
jurisdiction
or
to
compel
it
to
exercise
its
authority
when
it’s
its
duty
to
do
so.
now,
if
you’ll
read
the
all
writs
act
as
conferring
the
right
of
a
court
of
appeals
to
issue
the
writ
of
mandamus
where
it’s
appropriate,
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction,
where
it
thus
confronted
with
this
proposition.
how
it
could
that
be
in
aid
of
its
appellate
jurisdiction
when
the
person,
the
participant,
the
litigant
seeking
the
use
of
it
is
the
government
in
a
criminal
case,
and
since
the
government
has
a
limited
right
to
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
would
not
have
an
appellate
jurisdiction.
this
kind
of
reasoning
we
submit
was
the
reasoning
that
was
followed
by
the
second
circuit
in
the
united
states
versus
bondy
where
the
second
circuit
refused
to
issue
the
writ
to
the
government
to
grant
a
bill
of
particulars,
to
review
a
grant
of
bill
of
particulars
holding
that
it
had
no
actual
or
potential
jurisdiction
to
review
the
order
and
since
the
writ
was
in
aid
of
appellate
jurisdiction,
it
should
not
be
granted.
now,
a
different
viewpoint
has
been
followed
for
example
by
the
first
circuit
in
in
re
u.s.,
348
f.2d
624.
that
circuit
said
we
will
interpret
the
all
writs
section
that
is
in
aid
of
appellate
jurisdiction
and
what
i
have
suggested
in
our
brief
on
a
what
could
happen
philosophy
or
perhaps
a
chamber
of
horrors’
idea
if
the
government
refused
to
furnish
the
bill
of
particulars,
this
philosophy
would
hold
the
--
assistant
united
states
attorney
could
be
held
in
contempt
of
court
and
from
that
holding
of
contempt
could
go
up
on
appeal.
therefore,
theoretically
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
appellate
jurisdiction
and
therefore
the
writ
would
issue
in
aid
of
it.
or
in
the
alternative,
the
government
in
its
persistent
refusal
would
find
itself
with
a
dismissed
indictment
and
from
that
dismissal
of
the
indictment
perhaps
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
a
right
to
review
and
therefore
it
has
appellate
jurisdiction
and
therefore
the
writ
is
an
aid
of
the
appellate
jurisdiction.
apparently
it
is
this,
what
could
happen
philosophy,
which
prompted
the
seventh
circuit
to
reconsider
its
original
holding
when
it
said
it
would
reconsider
rather
than
remit
the
government
to
a
radical
alternative
appealable
judgment
available
to
the
trial
judge
upon
the
government’s
persistent
refusal
to
comply.
that
is
apparently
what
they
were
saying
that
this
is
the
only
--
we
don’t
want
to
submit
the
government
to
being
held
in
contempt
or
possible
dismissal
of
the
indictment
and
therefore
on
the
theory
that
what
could
happen,
we
would
have
appellate
jurisdiction
let’s
review
it.
but
to
accept
this
philosophy,
this
theory
would
also
ensure
the
proposition
that
appellate
jurisdiction
could
issue
on,
would
exist
on
the
issuance
of
any
order
and
the
writ
could
issue
as
a
result
of
any
order.
this
we
submit
is
contrary
to
the
ordered
judicial
process,
which
the
prohibition
against
piecemeal
appeals
is
meant
to
protect.
this
court
said
in
bankers
life
and
casualty
versus
holland,
if
we
applied
the
reasoning
advance
then
every
interlocutory
order,
which
is
wrong,
might
be
reviewed
under
the
all
writs
act.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
don’t
--
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
but
if
you
accept
the
philosophy
that
what
could
happen
as
a
result
of
a
persistent
refusal
to
comply
with
the
court’s
order
as
a
basis
for
ascertaining
whether
there
is
appellate
jurisdiction
then
you
could,
then
the
appeals
court
could
always
sit
back
and
say
well
they
could
always
be
held
in
contempt.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
yes.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
that
is
a
proposition
that
has
been
advanced
but
there’s
also
a
proposition
that
has
been
advanced
that
the
fact
that
the
action
may
--
for
failure
to
grant
the
writ
may
result
in
a
delay
by
virtue
of
causing
the
case
to
go
to
trial
and
causing
a
great
deal
of
expense
itself
is
not
enough
to
warrant
the
issuance
of
the
writ.
we
suggest
that
there’s
enough
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
determine
whether
the
writ
should
issue,
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
it
has
jurisdiction
but
we
suggest
that
this
court
should
now
assimilate
all
of
these
cases
and
say
clearly
in
a
criminal
situation
that
there’s
this
dichotomy.
so
that
the
government
would
be
restricted
in
approaching
a
court
of
appeals
in
a
--
from
an
order
of
--
an
interlocutory
order
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
our
first
position
is
that
there
should
be
a
clear
rule
between
criminal
and
civil
cases
and
that
if
the
government
felt
strongly
enough
in
the
situation
that
you
have
advanced
mr.
justice
fortas,
they
could
do
probably
what
was
done
in
bowman
dairy
and
that
was
refuse
to
comply
with
the
order
and
hold
itself
available
for
contempt
citation
and
that’s
what
happened
there,
and
gained
the
review.
but
we
don’t,
in
the
ultimate
we
don’t
go
that
far
for
purposes
of
decision
in
this
case
because
in
the
ultimate
even
if
this
court
does
not
wish
to
accept
a
dichotomy
between
civil
and
criminal
cases
and
you
accept
and
persist
in
a
view
of
the
rule
in
civil
cases
that
is
whether
there’s
a
clear
abuse
of
discretion,
which
might
be
the
proposition
that
you
have
advanced
that
there’s
certainly
a
clear
abuse
of
discretion
that
that
test
in
these
circumstances
would
not
warrant
the
issuance
of
the
writ.
now
the
--
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
yes.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
we
say
no
–
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
--
that
the
united
states
versus
apex
distributing
would
prevent
–
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
no
appeal,
no.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
that’s
right
but
that
is
not
of
a
significant
factor
because
in
dibella
versus
united
states
on
a
pre-indictment
motion
to
suppress
this
court
said
the
fact
that
the
government
can’t
appeal
does
not
change
the
circumstances
at
all.
the
fact
that
government
may
not
have
a
right
of
appeal
to
review
this
order
is
not
a
criterion
to
judge
whether
the
writ
should
issue
because
i
submit
this
mr.
justice
stewart
if
the
philosophy
of
the
government
here
is
accepted
then
in
the
dibella
situation
they
could
go
up
on
a
writ
of
mandamus.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
yes
it
is.
i
see
that
i
have
just
a
few
moments
remaining.
i
would
like
to
say
this
that
the
government
seems
to
urge
that
they
would
accept
the
philosophy
that
in
a
routine
ruling
the
writ
should
not
issue,
they
have
not
advised
the
court
what
they
consider
to
be
a
routine
ruling.
they
have
suggested
that
what
should
be
accepted
is
this
civil
case
test
citing
schlagenhauf
versus
holder,
and
la
buy
versus
howes
leather
company,
if
the
court
overlooks
the
dichotomy
between
civil
and
criminal
cases
and
if
the
court
does
not
feel
that
the
all
writs
act
is
restrictive
by
virtue
of
appellate
jurisdiction
philosophy,
then
we
submit
that
even
under
the
civil
test
of
schlagenhauf
and
la
buy
which
when
reduced
to
their
ultimate
is
not
–
are
nothing
more
than
a
question
of
whether
there
was
a
clear
abuse
of
discretion
that
under
that
test,
this
court,
judge
will
did
not
clearly
abuse
his
discretion.
he
had
the
jurisdiction
and
it’s
not
contested
that
he
has
jurisdiction
to
enter
an
order
requiring
a
disclosure
of
bill
of
particulars.
in
this
particular
case,
the
court
should
remember
that
the
nature
of
the
offense,
that
is
a
violation
of
72061
is
in
effect
a
written
perjury,
making
and
subscribing
a
false
tax
return
under
penalties
of
perjury
where
he
did
not
believe
everything
to
be
true.
the
nature
of
the
bill
of
particulars
was
statements
made
that
the
government
is
going
to
rely
upon
made
to
third
persons
and
who
are
those
third
persons?
now
it
would
appear
from
judge
will’s
finding
and
his
specific
ruling
here
that
in
the
nature
of
this
case,
in
the
nature
of
these
circumstances
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
and
was
required
to
receive
this
information
to
prevent
undue
surprise
and
prepare
his
defense.
therefore
we
suggest
under
any
of
these
tests,
the
dichotomy,
the
use
of
the
all
writ,
writ
section
or
finally
under
the
civil
case
test
that
judge
will
exercised
his
discretion
clearly
within
this
jurisdiction
and
properly.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
the
government
declined
to
furnish
the
names
and
addresses
of
persons
to
whom
or
in
whose
presence
the
defendant
made
statements,
which
would
be
relied
upon
by
the
government
in
its
case.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
--
not
the
substance
but
just
their
names.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
not
all
witnesses
justice
black
just
some
potential
witnesses.
there
wasn’t
nothing
which
would
imply
that
they
had
to
be
witnesses
or
that
there
would
not
be
other
persons
who
might
be
witnesses
but
--
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
we
submit
none,
no
damage
to
the
government
at
all.
mr.
harvey
m.

that’s
all
it
was
to
it.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
in
response
to
the
inquiry
by
the
--
mr.
chief
justice,
the
petitioner
would
agree
that
in
every
instance
where
the
government
in
good
faith
felt
that
the
order
of
the
district
court,
an
interlocutory
order
was
improper
that
they
could
effectively
cause
a
delay
by
seeking
the
extraordinary
writ
of
mandamus.
we
don't
suggest
that
in
this
case
that
the
government
was
acting
in
bad
faith.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
no,
but
the
net
effect
what
has
happened
is
that
is
going
to
be
at
least
two
years
before
the
case
can
go
to
the
merits.
now
i
suggested
yesterday
what
would
happen
in
the
situation
if
the
defendant
were
imprisoned
or
waiting
in
his
trial.
the
government
has
acted
in
good
faith
here.
we
don't
suggest
to
the
contrary,
but
we
believe
that
if
this
court
fails
to
set
forth
some
standards
that
in
a
criminal
case
what
would
happen
would
be
the
opening
of
the
floodgates
as
was
stated
last
term
in
the
switzerland
cheese
case.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
first,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
was
no
opinion.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
we
don't
know
what
prompted
the
court
of
appeals
to
act
as
it
did.
secondly,
we
suggest
that
this
was
not
extraordinary
at
all.
this
court
has
consistently
said
that
the
extraordinary
writ
should
be
reserved
for
really
extraordinary
situations.
one
can
hardly
think
of
a
more
common
place
situation
than
the
granting
of
the
bill
of
particulars.
and
moreover
the
type
of
particulars
that
were
granted
here
that
is
the
disclosure
of
the
names
of
some
potential
witnesses
is
also
a
commonplace
situation.
this
court
in
at
least
two
cases
has
indicated
that
the
bill
of
particulars
was
a
method
by
which
potential
witnesses
could
be
disclosed.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
roviaro
case,
this
court
said
that
the
name
of
the
informant
could
be
obtained
by
the
use
of
the
bill
of
particulars
and
if
the
government
didn't
want
to
furnish
it,
the
recourse
of
the
court
would
be
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
not,
voluntarily
mr.
justice
fortas,
but
by
order
of
the
court
under
the
bill
of
particulars
but
it's
--
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
well,
in
light
of
this
proceeding
where
they
feel
that
they
don't
have
to
take
the
--
and
i
would
agree.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
precisely.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
i
would
agree
that
what
they're
suggesting
here
is
that
the
ultimate
decision
of
whether
the
particulars
will
be
answered
lies
with
the
government
and
not
with
the
court.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
that
is
a
possibility
mr.
chief
justice,
but
we
suggest
that
even
in
the
framework
of
the
record
as
it
stands
now,
the
nature
of
the
particular
offense
charged
that
is
that
this
is
not
a
charge
of
income
tax
evasion,
this
is
a
charge
of
willfully
making
a
false
return
under
the
penalties
of
perjury,
not
believing
the
contents
of
that
return
to
be
true.
it's
in
the
nature
of
a
written
perjury.
the
government
is
frank
to
admit
now
that
here
are
admissions
by
the
defendant
concerning
this
willfulness
reflecting
upon
the
proposition
of
whether
in
fact
he
had
perjured
himself.
we
can't
think
of
any
clear
situation
where
a
court
would
say
that
this
–
the
names
of
people
to
whom
he's
made
those
statements
in
the
framework
of
this
kind
of
case
is
not
appropriate.
this
is
the
most
appropriate
situation
in
terms
of
this
bill
of
particulars,
if
i
may
have
one
more
minute
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
harvey
m.
silets
in
response
to
the
inquiry
by
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
suggest
that
he's
correct
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
is
what
the
government
suggests
a
routine
here,
which
we
don't
concede,
by
mr.
–
by
judge
will
to
furnish
these
of
kind
or
particulars
is
not
the
basis
for
this
court
to
rule
in
this
case.
this
court
must
rule
within
the
framework
of
these
facts
in
this
case.
this
is
precisely
what
the
court
took
some
pains
to
do
in
la
buy
case.
in
la
buy,
this
court
went
in
precise
details
about
the
exceptional
circumstances
in
the
case
that
came
before
this
court.
we
suggest
in
the
ultimate,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
if
the
government
is
permitted
to
use
the
extraordinary
writ
in
the
situation
that
the
floodgates
would
open,
that
the
entire
trial
of
cases
and
criminal
cases
would
be
open
to
speculation,
the
defendants
would
be
hard-put
to
proceed,
that
the
government
would
have
it
within
its
power
whether
the
grant
of
--
to
answer
a
bill
of
particulars
or
not.
and
then
finally
on
the
merits
of
this
particular
case
that
judge
will
was
within
his
discretion,
within
his
jurisdiction
to
grant
the
particulars
in
question.
thank
you.
