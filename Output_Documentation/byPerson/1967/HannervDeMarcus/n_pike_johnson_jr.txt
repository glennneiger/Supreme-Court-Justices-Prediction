mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
afraid
i
must
begin
in
our
speciously
no
doubt
by
disagreeing
with
mr.
justice
stewart's
position
relative
to
the
context
--
contextual
validity
of
the
constitutional
issue
before
the
court
and
whether
or
not
it
has
any
real
bearing
but
since
mr.
justice
stewart
has
left
i
believe
i
shall
wait
until
his
return,
perhaps
it
would
be
only
fair.
indeed,
it
is
the
respondent's
position
that
the
context
within
which
this
constitutional
issue
of
notice
has
been
raised
is
such
as
to
deny
the
existence
of
the
issue
entirely
insofar
as
this
court
is
concerned.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
pointed
out
a
dilemma
in
which
petitioner
now
finds
herself.
petitioner
contended
and
has
contended
throughout
these
proceedings
no
notice
was
given
to
her
the
execution
which
this
factual
situation
we
have
no
quarrel.
she
has
contended
that
she
should
have
been
given
some
notice
of
these
proceedings
and
with
that
we
have
no
quarrel
despite
the
fact
that
in
1924,
this
court
held
in
the
encyclopedia
press
case
and
that
no
such
notice
of
post-judgment
execution
was
constitutionally
required.
we
believe
and
we
believe
that
this
law
is
ought
to
be
altered
and
that
the
inequities
potential
under
that
theory
are
manifested.
but
let
us
examine,
if
the
court
please,
the
context
in
which
this
issue
has
been
raised.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
according
to
the
encyclopedia
press
case,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
again,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
issue
has
been
raised
in
a
context
in
which
i
believe
i
can
demonstrate
to
the
court
that
it
does
not
exist.
the
context
is
all
important.
the
reason
for
it
would
be
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
but,
if
your
honor
please,
the
reason
it
wasn't
sufficient
according
to
the
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
it
was
not
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
no
your
honor
i
would
agree
with
the
court.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
i
would
agree
with
your
honor
that
it
is
not
sufficient,
no.
but
let
us
examine
the
context
in
which
the
issue
was
raised.
petitioner
contends
that
the
statutes
of
arizona
provide
actual
notice
within
the
purview
of
the
schroeder
decision
and
within
the
purview
of
the
constitution
of
united
states
and
i
flatly
argue
this
according
to
their
reply
brief
at
page
six.
we
wish
to
reiterate
that
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
declare
any
statutes
or
rule
of
state
of
arizona
invalid.
we
believe
that
these
statutes
properly
applied
would
provide
sufficient
notice.
the
point
is,
however,
that
no
notice
was
in
fact
provided.
now,
in
what
way
do
the
petitioners
alleged
that
the
notice
is
required
to
that
we
go
to
the
opening
brief,
on
page
13,
if
the
court
please.
and
when
is
the
notice
--
when
is
the
requirement
of
notice
arise,
i'm
quoting
now
on
page
13
of
the
opening
brief.
we
believe
it
arises
from
the
statutory
requirement
that
a
debtor
be
allowed
to
point
out
to
the
sheriff
property
he
desires
to
be
levied
upon.
we
can
well
imagine
how
a
legislature
after
enacting
such
a
statute
would
go
home
well
satisfied
and
the
belief
that
no
real
property
could
be
seized
without
the
judgment
debtor
is
being
aware
of
the
levy
and
execution.
petitioner
is
contending
that
the
statutes
of
arizona
are
constitutional
provide
actual
notice
within
the
schroeder
--
within
the
purview
of
the
schroeder
case.
their
chief
argument
is
that
this
statute
was
not
followed
by
the
sheriff
in
his
levy
upon
the
property.
that
argument,
that
precise
argument,
that
constitutionality
was
denied
due
process
was
denied
by
the
failure
of
the
sheriff
to
comply
with
the
admittedly
constitutional
statutes
of
arizona
was
never,
never
once
raised
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona
until
the
motion
for
rehearing.
this
was
the
first
time
that
the
petitioner
contended
that
no
notice
was
given
before
that
reason.
initially
before
the
supreme
court
of
arizona,
they
contended
that
that
rule
53
(a)
which
allows
execution
in
the
particular
case
of
the
master
ought
to
require
notice
and
that
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
indeed,
i
do
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
there
is
no
record
i
submit
your
honor
upon
which
it
might
be
suggested
that
it
did
not
happen
in
the
following
sense.
first
of
all,
that
particular
argument
was
never
raised
--
blasingame
versus
wallace
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
precisely,
your
honor.
and
that
constitutional
deprivation
which
now
petitioner
seeks
to
argue
before
this
court
was
never
raised
nor
decided
upon
in
the
supreme
court
in
the
state
of
arizona.
it
was
raised
by
a
motion
for
rehearing
which
was
summarily
denied.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
no
your
honor.
rule
53
(a)
and
the
notice
of
which
we
are
here
involved
are
two
entirely
different
issues.
the
notice
with
which
we
are
here
involved
is
the
notice
required
by
execution
statutes,
that
petitioner
refers
to
and
which
the
sheriff
must
present
to
the
judgment
debtor
the
opportunity
to
point
out
his
personal
property.
the
notice
referred
to
in
the
supreme
court's
opinion
was
that
within
the
context
of
rule
53
(a)
which
states
that
if
the
stat
--
if
the
money
is
not
paid
to
the
master
--
master's
fee
is
not
paid
within
the
time
set
by
the
court
then
execution
--
without,
pardon
me,
after
proper
notice,
it's
what
it
says
then
execution
may
issue.
now,
in
the
supreme
court,
the
constitutional
argument
presented
by
petitioner
was
that
this
"notice"
in
that
statute
meant
notice
of
the
execution
rather
than
notice
of
the
judgment.
and
further
that
if
the
state
court
did
no
so
construe
the
statute
it
would
violate
constitution
of
the
united
states.
that
is
the
only
constitutional
question
that
was
presented
to
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
and
the
only
constitutional
question
upon
which
they
decided.
they
flatly
stated
that
a
clear
reading
of
the
statute
immediately
reveals
that
notice
means
notice
of
the
judgment
which
was
certainly
given
in
this
case
and
not
notice
of
the
execution.
petitioner's
argument
in
that
regard
it
seems
to
me
to
be
wholly
frivolous
in
the
sense
that
it
would
be
somewhat
illogical.
petitioner
having
already
conceded
that
the
execution
statutes
do
demand
actual
notice,
it
would
be
if
somewhat
illogical
now
to
argue
that
the
master's
statutes
ought
to
provide
an
additional
notice
and
indeed
in
their
reply
brief
they
don't
--
not
so
much
has
mentioned
this
argument
that
is
the
context
of
53
(a)
as
demanding
notice
seems
to
have
been
dropped
from
the
reply
brief.
now,
they
seem
to
say
that
somehow
despite
the
fact
that
the
proper
context
was
not
presented
to
this
court,
despite
the
fact
that
they
never
argue
to
the
supreme
court
that
its
statute
relative
to
the
sheriff's
presenting
of
this
opportunity
to
the
judgment
debtor.
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
never
mentioned
until
the
motion
for
rehearing
and
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
never
passed
upon
or
decided
by
the
supreme
court,
petitioner
wants
this
court
to
find
that
there
was
something
unconstitutional
about
this
with
the
complete
lack
of
context.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
climate
control
versus
hill.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
that
is
my
interpretation
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
indeed.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
well,
i
am
indeed
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
motion
for
rehearing
according
to
the
supreme
court
of
arizona,
the
motion
for
rehearing
where
there
is
a
statutory
matter
to
which
they
would
not
be
entitled
to
rehear
matters
but
for
rule
9
(a)
of
the
rule
of
the
supreme
court
which
have
been
provided
the
leading
case
in
arizona
controlling
this
climate
control
versus
hill,
the
nature
of
a
rehearing.
it
is
a
somewhat
anomalous
case
and
that
it
states
that
the
rehearing
--
in
rehearing
nothing
new
can
be
presented
because
it
has
not
been
heard
and
therefore
it
was
not
a
subject
to
rehearing
nor
can
anything
old
be
presented
because
rehearing
is
not
to
include
the
same
grounds
over
which
the
court
has
already
been
led.
therefore,
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
precisely.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
precisely
mr.
justice
fortas.
indeed,
blasingame
versus
wallace
says
everything
that
the
petitioner
suggests
that
it
says.
it
says
that
if
a
sheriff
does
not
comply
with
his
duty,
if
he
does
not
give
to
the
judgment
debtor
the
opportunity
to
point
out
his
property
then
the
execution
is
defective
and
it
will
be
set
aside.
therefore,
petitioner
is
correct
when
he
alleges
--
when
she
alleges
that
this
particular
portion
of
the
arizona
statutes
do
require
actual
notice
and
do
provide
the
debtor
with
an
opportunity
to
know
what's
happening
to
his
property.
so
blasingame
versus
wallace
is
right
on
point.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
had
blasingame
versus
wallace
been
raised
at
the
superior
court
level
in
this
case,
in
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
there
might
then
have
been
a
question
of
fact
relative
to
whether
or
not
sheriff
performed
his
duty
and
a
record
thereon
and
that
the
supreme
court
at
that
time
might
have
denied
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
tried
this
case
precisely
on
that
issue.
it
never
was
presented
to
the
superior
court.
blasingame
versus
wallace
was
never
cited
to
the
superior
court
and
the
superior
court
therefore
have
no
record
nor
opportunity
to
factually
investigate
this
or
to
make
a
record
upon
this
issue
and
precisely
the
same
thing
occurred
in
the
supreme
court
of
arizona.
blasingame
versus
wallace
was
never
cited.
the
execution
statutes
were
never
cited.
the
argument
was
never
made
and
the
sheriff
did
not
comply
his
duty
and
that
is
the
precise
argument
that
petitioner
today
in
this
court
relies
upon
to
provide
the
constitutional
deprivation
which
he
seeks
this
court
to
a
judge
existed.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
mrs.
hanner's
affidavit
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
from
the
sheriff
either
indeed.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
i
agree
with
that
mr.
justice
marshall
however
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
well,
my
point
if
the
court
please
is
that
an
affidavit
of
fact
has
no
legal
context
in
the
absence
of
its
being
considered
by
the
court.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
yes,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
to
controvert
that
particular
point,
i
would
say
no,
your
honor.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
the
factual
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
indeed
it
was,
your
honor.
it
was
no,
your
honor
that
particular
affidavit
was
before
the
superior
court
and
in
the
sense
that
it
was
in
the
record.
it
was
before
the
supreme
court.
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor,
however,
that
even
that
particular
factual
situation
has
to
be
placed
in
some
legal
context
and
at
least
not
only
in
a
legal
context
state
--
in
a
state
court
before
both
the
superior
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
it
was
indeed
your
honor
but
it
was
never
placed
in
to
a
legal
context
by
counsel.
it
was
never
argued,
it
was
never
placed
in
a
brief
to
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
and
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
right,
your
honor.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
my
point.
the
blasingame
versus
wallace
therefore
was
never
cited
nor
argued
particularly
in
a
constitutional
context,
if
the
court
please,
even
if
the
court
might
say
that
the
factual
issue
and
therefore
the
legal
issue
should
somehow
have
been
absorbed
by
the
court,
superior
court
and
that
the
superior
court
should
somehow
have
rule
in
accordance
with
blasingame
despite
the
fact
that
the
argument
was
never
made
to
them
relative
to
blasingame.
then
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
this
is
considerably
beyond
the
court's
perhaps
proper
providence
but
i
would
suggest
certainly
that
in
the
total
absence
of
this
issue
being
raised
in
a
constitutional
context
before
the
supreme
court
of
arizona,
this
court
would
be
denying
where
it
to
suddenly
go
back
to
that
affidavit
and
state,
this
court's
ought
to
have
picked
it
up
and
ought
to
have
realized
some
constitutional
deprivation
occurred
by
virtue
of
not
having
applied
with
the
state
statute.
supreme
court
of
arizona
there's
a
factual
determination
which
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
is
entitled
to
rule
upon
did
they
comply
with
our
statutes?
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
absolutely,
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
exactly,
your
honor.
however,
i
relied
precisely
upon
the
encyclopedia
press
case
in
my
response
to
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari
and
since
this
court
saw
fit
to
hear
the
case,
i
am
somewhat
weary
of
arguing
the
validity
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
i
have
that
feeling
if
the
court
please.
i
think
the
viability
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
that
is
precisely
correct
if
the
court
please.
i
think
if
i
have
to
rely
upon
the
present
situation
upon
encyclopedia
press
i
would
raise
my
hands
and
surrender
because
i
do
agree
that
there
are
potential
inequities
in
that
case.
there
are
things
to
be
set
forth,
of
course,
an
individual
does
not
pays
his
indebtedness.
perhaps
he
ought
to
suffer
the
risk
of
losing
at
least
somewhat
more
not
inconsiderably
more
but
at
least
some
what
more.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
if
notice
under
schroeder
is
required
and
will
be
required
under
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
--
post
judgment
execution
upon
real
property
than
the
actual
notice
given
in
this
case,
i
would
suppose
is
not
adequate.
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
i
am
suggesting
to
the
court
that
in
the
context
in
which
this
lack
of
notice
is
raised
in
this
case,
this
case
and
this
state
even
that
the
state
law
within
which
this
issue
is
raised,
this
is
not
the
case
neither
the
case
nor
the
state
within
which
to
accomplish
this
result.
perhaps
another
case
tomorrow
will
arrive
at
this
court
perhaps
yesterday,
we
don't
know,
in
which
petitioner
will
argue
that
the
state
laws
do
no
provide
actual
notice
of
any
kind
and
do
not
protect
the
judgment
debtor
in
anyway
and
that
therefore
under
schroeder
this
court
should
apply
them
--
the
mullane,
hanover
bank
case
and
rule
that
in
post
judgment
execution
on
real
property
this
sending
of
a
simple
letter
syndrome
should
apply.
but
this,
i
submit,
is
not
a
case
in
which
this
court
should
decide
that
particular
issue
because
counsel
is
not
contending
that
the
sending
of
a
simple
letter
should
be
required.
petitioner
is
contending
the
philosopher
is
on
a
due
to
provide
actual
notice
and
that
do
provide
constitutional
protection
but
simply
that
they
were
not
complied
with
and
this
is
the
first
time
other
than
in
a
motion
for
rehearing
which
this
court
has
consistently
held
is
not
record
upon
which
or
rather
it
has
no
part
of
the
record
upon
which
the
judgment
is
based
in
the
lower
court,
therefore,
which
is
not
properly
before
this
court.
in
the
motion
for
rehearing,
this
was
raised
and
now
it
is
being
raised
in
this
court
when
it
should
have
been
raised
in
the
superior
court
of
maricopa
county
state
of
arizona
a
long
time
ago
and
i
submit
that
this
court
does
not
set
as
an
ad
hoc,
ad
hominem
investigator
of
constitutionality
and
at
the
same
time
as
a
reviewer
of
the
actions
of
the
previous
counsel
before
petitioner
is
far
back
as
the
superior
court
for
the
state
of
arizona.
i
should
like
to
make
a
few
remarks
relative
to
the
equities
in
this
matter.
the
portrayal
of
my
client
as
a
dastardly
fellow,
an
ambulatory
sociological
imbalance
who
has
prevailed
in
such
a
fashion
upon
this
poor
woman
carries
with
it
the
assumption
that
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
doesn't
know
inequity
when
it's
staring
them
in
the
face.
and
i
assure
this
court
that
such
is
not
true
for
the
gentlemen
who
sit
upon
that
court.
they
have
never
failed
to
strike
down
an
inequitable
execution
upon
real
property.
they
did
it
in
blasingame
versus
wallace,
they
did
it
in
young
versus
serving
house,
they
did
in
the
celebrated
case
of
clarence
o'
jackson
versus
montgomery
ward
or
sears
and
roebuck.
sears
and
roebuck.
they
have
done
it
consistently,
they
will
continue
to
do
it
and
there
is
no
suggest
--
what
is
suppose
did
impress
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
concerning
the
equities
of
this
case.
why
did
they
think
that
the
equities
were
on
the
side
of
my
client
because
mrs.
hanner
and
i'm
searching
for
euphemism
which
might
be
appropriate
to
these
hollowed
halls
but
i
can't
find
any.
mrs.
hanner
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
well,
perhaps
your
honor
i
apologize.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
but
what
adjective
--
to
what
adjective
does
your
honor
refer?
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
well,
it
was
the
feeling,
if
the
court
please,
of
the
supreme
court
of
arizona.
i
think
the
rightfully
some
that
mrs.
hanner
would've
beaten
mr.
demarcus
out
of
his
fee,
out
of
every
last
penny
of
it
were
if
not
for
the
availability
of
the
precise
remedy
which
he
prevail
himself
in
this
case.
not
through
this
entire
period
of
years
from
1959
to
the
present
as
mrs.
hanner
offered
to
pay
mr.
demarcus
one
single
penny
of
the
fee
to
which
he
admits
that
he
is
entitled
and
this
i
submit
was
the
equitable
factor
of
which
impelled,
which
it
pressed
to
these.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
to
state
for
example
of
that
mr.
demarcus
was
proceeding
fairly,
that
the
execution
was
reasonable
under
the
circumstances
that
he
was
exercising
the
precise
right
which
was
granted
him
by
statute
that
he
executed
upon
the
only
property,
only
property
reasonable
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
i
believe
these
are
the
only
separate
property
upon
which
it
was
reasonable
execute.
the
equities
of
the
case
according
to
the
supreme
court
were
on
the
side
of
mr.
demarcus
and
i
would
suggest
that
to
this
court
that
they
were
perhaps
closer
to
the
facts
in
this
situation
than
we
are
today.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
the
court
was
never
mr.
chief
justice
never
faced
with
the
allegation
that
real
property
existed.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
they
were
talking
about
the
value
of
the
property,
if
the
court
please,
in
that
context.
they
were
talking
about
whether
or
not
there
was
an
inequity
between
the
value
of
the
property
and
the
fee.
that
is
my
recollection,
i
stand
corrected
if
anybody
--
if
that
is
not
so.
it
is
my
feeling
that
they
never
mentioned
the
existence
of
any
personal
property
because
again
the
issue
of
personal
property
and
the
issue
of
the
sheriff's
duty
never
raised,
never
raised
before
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona
or
did
they
decide
upon
that
issue.
the
taxes,
if
the
court
please,
one
reference
to
that
matter
in
the
record
on
page
18.
josephine
hanner's
affidavit
states
that
she
paid
the
taxes
from
1948
until
1960.
this
indeed
is
i
believe
the
correct
state
of
facts.
i
have
the
canceled
checks.
of
course
they
were
never
made
a
part
of
the
record
but
they
are
in
my
hand
at
the
moment,
canceled
checks
representing
the
payment
of
the
taxes
in
1961
and
1962
by
mr.
demarcus,
our
client,
not
by
mrs.
hanner.
the
--
i
have
always
thought
i
may
--
if
i
may
state
if
i
have
more
time
that
mr.
demarcus'
position
as
a
special
master
and
as
an
officer
the
court
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
this
case.
he
was
at
that
time
enforcing
his
rights
as
a
creditor
and
indeed
enforcing
his
rights
in
that
capacity
in
precisely
the
manner
provided,
proscribed
by
statute
and
this
again
in
this
connection
of
the
supreme
court
for
the
state
of
arizona
was
correct.
i
am,
i
suppose,
requesting
that
the
inevitable
extension
of
the
hanover
doctrine
to
post
judgment
execution
statutes
which
i
believe
will
occur
in
this
court,
which
i
believe
ought
to
occur
in
this
court.
i
should
like
once
more
to
request
the
court
not
to
accomplish
that
result
in
this
case
because
in
this
case
problem
does
not
present
itself
in
a
manner
in
which
that
result
could
be
accomplished
without
first
violating
the
precedents
of
this
court,
and
second
establishing
a
result
which
is
not
anticipated
nor
prayed
for
by
either
party.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
that's
a
difficult
case
to
answer
mr.
chief
justice
because
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
if
the
case
is
properly
here
and
if
in
the
context
in
which
it
is
here
this
court
can
extend
hanover
and
state
that
my
client
should
have
sent
a
simple
letter
within
the
context
in
which
this
constitutional
issue
is
presented
and
considering
but
that
is
not
petitioner's
argument
even
remotely
that
his
argument
is
that
the
state
laws
which
provide
actual
notice
were
not
complied
with
it
if
within
this
context
the
court
can
imply
--
can
apply
hanover
then
i
should
lose
the
case,
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
would.
but
again,
i
find
it
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
if
i
thought
mr.
justice
harlan
that
this
result
could
have
been
contemplated
and
anticipated
under
this
presentation
and
in
the
posture
in
which
this
case
now
stand,
i
have
no
doubt
that
there
will
be
amicus
briefs
filed
to
this
house
from
these
various
states
whose
statutes
would
be
struck
down
with
such
a
decision.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
again,
mr.
justice
harlan,
they
state
flatly
that
they're
not
trying
to
strike
down
any
state
statute.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
even
then
this
court
would
have
to
go
against
petitioner's
expressed
prayer
and
strike
down
at
least
by
implication
and
indeed
explicitly
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
arizona
in
the
sense
that
they
do
not
provide
for
actual
notice
which
is
not
petitioner's
argument
which
indeed
is
precisely
that
which
petitioner
does
not
argue.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
i
did
not
rest
on
encyclopedia,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
it
covers
it
precisely,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
indeed,
mr.
justice
white.
i
of
course
rest
on
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
indeed,
that's
what
i
will
do,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
afraid
i
must
begin
in
our
speciously
no
doubt
by
disagreeing
with
mr.
justice
stewart's
position
relative
to
the
context
--
contextual
validity
of
the
constitutional
issue
before
the
court
and
whether
or
not
it
has
any
real
bearing
but
since
mr.
justice
stewart
has
left
i
believe
i
shall
wait
until
his
return,
perhaps
it
would
be
only
fair.
indeed,
it
is
the
respondent's
position
that
the
context
within
which
this
constitutional
issue
of
notice
has
been
raised
is
such
as
to
deny
the
existence
of
the
issue
entirely
insofar
as
this
court
is
concerned.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
pointed
out
a
dilemma
in
which
petitioner
now
finds
herself.
petitioner
contended
and
has
contended
throughout
these
proceedings
no
notice
was
given
to
her
the
execution
which
this
factual
situation
we
have
no
quarrel.
she
has
contended
that
she
should
have
been
given
some
notice
of
these
proceedings
and
with
that
we
have
no
quarrel
despite
the
fact
that
in
1924,
this
court
held
in
the
encyclopedia
press
case
and
that
no
such
notice
of
post-judgment
execution
was
constitutionally
required.
we
believe
and
we
believe
that
this
law
is
ought
to
be
altered
and
that
the
inequities
potential
under
that
theory
are
manifested.
but
let
us
examine,
if
the
court
please,
the
context
in
which
this
issue
has
been
raised.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
according
to
the
encyclopedia
press
case,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
again,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
issue
has
been
raised
in
a
context
in
which
i
believe
i
can
demonstrate
to
the
court
that
it
does
not
exist.
the
context
is
all
important.
the
reason
for
it
would
be
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
but,
if
your
honor
please,
the
reason
it
wasn't
sufficient
according
to
the
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
it
was
not
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
no
your
honor
i
would
agree
with
the
court.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
i
would
agree
with
your
honor
that
it
is
not
sufficient,
no.
but
let
us
examine
the
context
in
which
the
issue
was
raised.
petitioner
contends
that
the
statutes
of
arizona
provide
actual
notice
within
the
purview
of
the
schroeder
decision
and
within
the
purview
of
the
constitution
of
united
states
and
i
flatly
argue
this
according
to
their
reply
brief
at
page
six.
we
wish
to
reiterate
that
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
declare
any
statutes
or
rule
of
state
of
arizona
invalid.
we
believe
that
these
statutes
properly
applied
would
provide
sufficient
notice.
the
point
is,
however,
that
no
notice
was
in
fact
provided.
now,
in
what
way
do
the
petitioners
alleged
that
the
notice
is
required
to
that
we
go
to
the
opening
brief,
on
page
13,
if
the
court
please.
and
when
is
the
notice
--
when
is
the
requirement
of
notice
arise,
i'm
quoting
now
on
page
13
of
the
opening
brief.
we
believe
it
arises
from
the
statutory
requirement
that
a
debtor
be
allowed
to
point
out
to
the
sheriff
property
he
desires
to
be
levied
upon.
we
can
well
imagine
how
a
legislature
after
enacting
such
a
statute
would
go
home
well
satisfied
and
the
belief
that
no
real
property
could
be
seized
without
the
judgment
debtor
is
being
aware
of
the
levy
and
execution.
petitioner
is
contending
that
the
statutes
of
arizona
are
constitutional
provide
actual
notice
within
the
schroeder
--
within
the
purview
of
the
schroeder
case.
their
chief
argument
is
that
this
statute
was
not
followed
by
the
sheriff
in
his
levy
upon
the
property.
that
argument,
that
precise
argument,
that
constitutionality
was
denied
due
process
was
denied
by
the
failure
of
the
sheriff
to
comply
with
the
admittedly
constitutional
statutes
of
arizona
was
never,
never
once
raised
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona
until
the
motion
for
rehearing.
this
was
the
first
time
that
the
petitioner
contended
that
no
notice
was
given
before
that
reason.
initially
before
the
supreme
court
of
arizona,
they
contended
that
that
rule
53
(a)
which
allows
execution
in
the
particular
case
of
the
master
ought
to
require
notice
and
that
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
indeed,
i
do
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
there
is
no
record
i
submit
your
honor
upon
which
it
might
be
suggested
that
it
did
not
happen
in
the
following
sense.
first
of
all,
that
particular
argument
was
never
raised
--
blasingame
versus
wallace
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
precisely,
your
honor.
and
that
constitutional
deprivation
which
now
petitioner
seeks
to
argue
before
this
court
was
never
raised
nor
decided
upon
in
the
supreme
court
in
the
state
of
arizona.
it
was
raised
by
a
motion
for
rehearing
which
was
summarily
denied.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
no
your
honor.
rule
53
(a)
and
the
notice
of
which
we
are
here
involved
are
two
entirely
different
issues.
the
notice
with
which
we
are
here
involved
is
the
notice
required
by
execution
statutes,
that
petitioner
refers
to
and
which
the
sheriff
must
present
to
the
judgment
debtor
the
opportunity
to
point
out
his
personal
property.
the
notice
referred
to
in
the
supreme
court's
opinion
was
that
within
the
context
of
rule
53
(a)
which
states
that
if
the
stat
--
if
the
money
is
not
paid
to
the
master
--
master's
fee
is
not
paid
within
the
time
set
by
the
court
then
execution
--
without,
pardon
me,
after
proper
notice,
it's
what
it
says
then
execution
may
issue.
now,
in
the
supreme
court,
the
constitutional
argument
presented
by
petitioner
was
that
this
"notice"
in
that
statute
meant
notice
of
the
execution
rather
than
notice
of
the
judgment.
and
further
that
if
the
state
court
did
no
so
construe
the
statute
it
would
violate
constitution
of
the
united
states.
that
is
the
only
constitutional
question
that
was
presented
to
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
and
the
only
constitutional
question
upon
which
they
decided.
they
flatly
stated
that
a
clear
reading
of
the
statute
immediately
reveals
that
notice
means
notice
of
the
judgment
which
was
certainly
given
in
this
case
and
not
notice
of
the
execution.
petitioner's
argument
in
that
regard
it
seems
to
me
to
be
wholly
frivolous
in
the
sense
that
it
would
be
somewhat
illogical.
petitioner
having
already
conceded
that
the
execution
statutes
do
demand
actual
notice,
it
would
be
if
somewhat
illogical
now
to
argue
that
the
master's
statutes
ought
to
provide
an
additional
notice
and
indeed
in
their
reply
brief
they
don't
--
not
so
much
has
mentioned
this
argument
that
is
the
context
of
53
(a)
as
demanding
notice
seems
to
have
been
dropped
from
the
reply
brief.
now,
they
seem
to
say
that
somehow
despite
the
fact
that
the
proper
context
was
not
presented
to
this
court,
despite
the
fact
that
they
never
argue
to
the
supreme
court
that
its
statute
relative
to
the
sheriff's
presenting
of
this
opportunity
to
the
judgment
debtor.
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
never
mentioned
until
the
motion
for
rehearing
and
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
never
passed
upon
or
decided
by
the
supreme
court,
petitioner
wants
this
court
to
find
that
there
was
something
unconstitutional
about
this
with
the
complete
lack
of
context.
mr.

climate
control
versus
hill.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
that
is
my
interpretation
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
indeed.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
well,
i
am
indeed
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
motion
for
rehearing
according
to
the
supreme
court
of
arizona,
the
motion
for
rehearing
where
there
is
a
statutory
matter
to
which
they
would
not
be
entitled
to
rehear
matters
but
for
rule
9
(a)
of
the
rule
of
the
supreme
court
which
have
been
provided
the
leading
case
in
arizona
controlling
this
climate
control
versus
hill,
the
nature
of
a
rehearing.
it
is
a
somewhat
anomalous
case
and
that
it
states
that
the
rehearing
--
in
rehearing
nothing
new
can
be
presented
because
it
has
not
been
heard
and
therefore
it
was
not
a
subject
to
rehearing
nor
can
anything
old
be
presented
because
rehearing
is
not
to
include
the
same
grounds
over
which
the
court
has
already
been
led.
therefore,
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
precisely.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
precisely
mr.
justice
fortas.
indeed,
blasingame
versus
wallace
says
everything
that
the
petitioner
suggests
that
it
says.
it
says
that
if
a
sheriff
does
not
comply
with
his
duty,
if
he
does
not
give
to
the
judgment
debtor
the
opportunity
to
point
out
his
property
then
the
execution
is
defective
and
it
will
be
set
aside.
therefore,
petitioner
is
correct
when
he
alleges
--
when
she
alleges
that
this
particular
portion
of
the
arizona
statutes
do
require
actual
notice
and
do
provide
the
debtor
with
an
opportunity
to
know
what's
happening
to
his
property.
so
blasingame
versus
wallace
is
right
on
point.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
had
blasingame
versus
wallace
been
raised
at
the
superior
court
level
in
this
case,
in
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
there
might
then
have
been
a
question
of
fact
relative
to
whether
or
not
sheriff
performed
his
duty
and
a
record
thereon
and
that
the
supreme
court
at
that
time
might
have
denied
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
tried
this
case
precisely
on
that
issue.
it
never
was
presented
to
the
superior
court.
blasingame
versus
wallace
was
never
cited
to
the
superior
court
and
the
superior
court
therefore
have
no
record
nor
opportunity
to
factually
investigate
this
or
to
make
a
record
upon
this
issue
and
precisely
the
same
thing
occurred
in
the
supreme
court
of
arizona.
blasingame
versus
wallace
was
never
cited.
the
execution
statutes
were
never
cited.
the
argument
was
never
made
and
the
sheriff
did
not
comply
his
duty
and
that
is
the
precise
argument
that
petitioner
today
in
this
court
relies
upon
to
provide
the
constitutional
deprivation
which
he
seeks
this
court
to
a
judge
existed.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
mrs.
hanner's
affidavit
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
from
the
sheriff
either
indeed.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
i
agree
with
that
mr.
justice
marshall
however
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
well,
my
point
if
the
court
please
is
that
an
affidavit
of
fact
has
no
legal
context
in
the
absence
of
its
being
considered
by
the
court.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
yes,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
to
controvert
that
particular
point,
i
would
say
no,
your
honor.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
the
factual
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
indeed
it
was,
your
honor.
it
was
no,
your
honor
that
particular
affidavit
was
before
the
superior
court
and
in
the
sense
that
it
was
in
the
record.
it
was
before
the
supreme
court.
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor,
however,
that
even
that
particular
factual
situation
has
to
be
placed
in
some
legal
context
and
at
least
not
only
in
a
legal
context
state
--
in
a
state
court
before
both
the
superior
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
it
was
indeed
your
honor
but
it
was
never
placed
in
to
a
legal
context
by
counsel.
it
was
never
argued,
it
was
never
placed
in
a
brief
to
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
and
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
right,
your
honor.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
my
point.
the
blasingame
versus
wallace
therefore
was
never
cited
nor
argued
particularly
in
a
constitutional
context,
if
the
court
please,
even
if
the
court
might
say
that
the
factual
issue
and
therefore
the
legal
issue
should
somehow
have
been
absorbed
by
the
court,
superior
court
and
that
the
superior
court
should
somehow
have
rule
in
accordance
with
blasingame
despite
the
fact
that
the
argument
was
never
made
to
them
relative
to
blasingame.
then
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
this
is
considerably
beyond
the
court's
perhaps
proper
providence
but
i
would
suggest
certainly
that
in
the
total
absence
of
this
issue
being
raised
in
a
constitutional
context
before
the
supreme
court
of
arizona,
this
court
would
be
denying
where
it
to
suddenly
go
back
to
that
affidavit
and
state,
this
court's
ought
to
have
picked
it
up
and
ought
to
have
realized
some
constitutional
deprivation
occurred
by
virtue
of
not
having
applied
with
the
state
statute.
supreme
court
of
arizona
there's
a
factual
determination
which
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
is
entitled
to
rule
upon
did
they
comply
with
our
statutes?
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
absolutely,
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
exactly,
your
honor.
however,
i
relied
precisely
upon
the
encyclopedia
press
case
in
my
response
to
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari
and
since
this
court
saw
fit
to
hear
the
case,
i
am
somewhat
weary
of
arguing
the
validity
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
i
have
that
feeling
if
the
court
please.
i
think
the
viability
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
that
is
precisely
correct
if
the
court
please.
i
think
if
i
have
to
rely
upon
the
present
situation
upon
encyclopedia
press
i
would
raise
my
hands
and
surrender
because
i
do
agree
that
there
are
potential
inequities
in
that
case.
there
are
things
to
be
set
forth,
of
course,
an
individual
does
not
pays
his
indebtedness.
perhaps
he
ought
to
suffer
the
risk
of
losing
at
least
somewhat
more
not
inconsiderably
more
but
at
least
some
what
more.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
if
notice
under
schroeder
is
required
and
will
be
required
under
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
--
post
judgment
execution
upon
real
property
than
the
actual
notice
given
in
this
case,
i
would
suppose
is
not
adequate.
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
i
am
suggesting
to
the
court
that
in
the
context
in
which
this
lack
of
notice
is
raised
in
this
case,
this
case
and
this
state
even
that
the
state
law
within
which
this
issue
is
raised,
this
is
not
the
case
neither
the
case
nor
the
state
within
which
to
accomplish
this
result.
perhaps
another
case
tomorrow
will
arrive
at
this
court
perhaps
yesterday,
we
don't
know,
in
which
petitioner
will
argue
that
the
state
laws
do
no
provide
actual
notice
of
any
kind
and
do
not
protect
the
judgment
debtor
in
anyway
and
that
therefore
under
schroeder
this
court
should
apply
them
--
the
mullane,
hanover
bank
case
and
rule
that
in
post
judgment
execution
on
real
property
this
sending
of
a
simple
letter
syndrome
should
apply.
but
this,
i
submit,
is
not
a
case
in
which
this
court
should
decide
that
particular
issue
because
counsel
is
not
contending
that
the
sending
of
a
simple
letter
should
be
required.
petitioner
is
contending
the
philosopher
is
on
a
due
to
provide
actual
notice
and
that
do
provide
constitutional
protection
but
simply
that
they
were
not
complied
with
and
this
is
the
first
time
other
than
in
a
motion
for
rehearing
which
this
court
has
consistently
held
is
not
record
upon
which
or
rather
it
has
no
part
of
the
record
upon
which
the
judgment
is
based
in
the
lower
court,
therefore,
which
is
not
properly
before
this
court.
in
the
motion
for
rehearing,
this
was
raised
and
now
it
is
being
raised
in
this
court
when
it
should
have
been
raised
in
the
superior
court
of
maricopa
county
state
of
arizona
a
long
time
ago
and
i
submit
that
this
court
does
not
set
as
an
ad
hoc,
ad
hominem
investigator
of
constitutionality
and
at
the
same
time
as
a
reviewer
of
the
actions
of
the
previous
counsel
before
petitioner
is
far
back
as
the
superior
court
for
the
state
of
arizona.
i
should
like
to
make
a
few
remarks
relative
to
the
equities
in
this
matter.
the
portrayal
of
my
client
as
a
dastardly
fellow,
an
ambulatory
sociological
imbalance
who
has
prevailed
in
such
a
fashion
upon
this
poor
woman
carries
with
it
the
assumption
that
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
doesn't
know
inequity
when
it's
staring
them
in
the
face.
and
i
assure
this
court
that
such
is
not
true
for
the
gentlemen
who
sit
upon
that
court.
they
have
never
failed
to
strike
down
an
inequitable
execution
upon
real
property.
they
did
it
in
blasingame
versus
wallace,
they
did
it
in
young
versus
serving
house,
they
did
in
the
celebrated
case
of
clarence
o'
jackson
versus
montgomery
ward
or
sears
and
roebuck.
sears
and
roebuck.
they
have
done
it
consistently,
they
will
continue
to
do
it
and
there
is
no
suggest
--
what
is
suppose
did
impress
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
concerning
the
equities
of
this
case.
why
did
they
think
that
the
equities
were
on
the
side
of
my
client
because
mrs.
hanner
and
i'm
searching
for
euphemism
which
might
be
appropriate
to
these
hollowed
halls
but
i
can't
find
any.
mrs.
hanner
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
well,
perhaps
your
honor
i
apologize.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
but
what
adjective
--
to
what
adjective
does
your
honor
refer?
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
well,
it
was
the
feeling,
if
the
court
please,
of
the
supreme
court
of
arizona.
i
think
the
rightfully
some
that
mrs.
hanner
would've
beaten
mr.
demarcus
out
of
his
fee,
out
of
every
last
penny
of
it
were
if
not
for
the
availability
of
the
precise
remedy
which
he
prevail
himself
in
this
case.
not
through
this
entire
period
of
years
from
1959
to
the
present
as
mrs.
hanner
offered
to
pay
mr.
demarcus
one
single
penny
of
the
fee
to
which
he
admits
that
he
is
entitled
and
this
i
submit
was
the
equitable
factor
of
which
impelled,
which
it
pressed
to
these.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
to
state
for
example
of
that
mr.
demarcus
was
proceeding
fairly,
that
the
execution
was
reasonable
under
the
circumstances
that
he
was
exercising
the
precise
right
which
was
granted
him
by
statute
that
he
executed
upon
the
only
property,
only
property
reasonable
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
i
believe
these
are
the
only
separate
property
upon
which
it
was
reasonable
execute.
the
equities
of
the
case
according
to
the
supreme
court
were
on
the
side
of
mr.
demarcus
and
i
would
suggest
that
to
this
court
that
they
were
perhaps
closer
to
the
facts
in
this
situation
than
we
are
today.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
the
court
was
never
mr.
chief
justice
never
faced
with
the
allegation
that
real
property
existed.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
they
were
talking
about
the
value
of
the
property,
if
the
court
please,
in
that
context.
they
were
talking
about
whether
or
not
there
was
an
inequity
between
the
value
of
the
property
and
the
fee.
that
is
my
recollection,
i
stand
corrected
if
anybody
--
if
that
is
not
so.
it
is
my
feeling
that
they
never
mentioned
the
existence
of
any
personal
property
because
again
the
issue
of
personal
property
and
the
issue
of
the
sheriff's
duty
never
raised,
never
raised
before
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona
or
did
they
decide
upon
that
issue.
the
taxes,
if
the
court
please,
one
reference
to
that
matter
in
the
record
on
page
18.
josephine
hanner's
affidavit
states
that
she
paid
the
taxes
from
1948
until
1960.
this
indeed
is
i
believe
the
correct
state
of
facts.
i
have
the
canceled
checks.
of
course
they
were
never
made
a
part
of
the
record
but
they
are
in
my
hand
at
the
moment,
canceled
checks
representing
the
payment
of
the
taxes
in
1961
and
1962
by
mr.
demarcus,
our
client,
not
by
mrs.
hanner.
the
--
i
have
always
thought
i
may
--
if
i
may
state
if
i
have
more
time
that
mr.
demarcus'
position
as
a
special
master
and
as
an
officer
the
court
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
this
case.
he
was
at
that
time
enforcing
his
rights
as
a
creditor
and
indeed
enforcing
his
rights
in
that
capacity
in
precisely
the
manner
provided,
proscribed
by
statute
and
this
again
in
this
connection
of
the
supreme
court
for
the
state
of
arizona
was
correct.
i
am,
i
suppose,
requesting
that
the
inevitable
extension
of
the
hanover
doctrine
to
post
judgment
execution
statutes
which
i
believe
will
occur
in
this
court,
which
i
believe
ought
to
occur
in
this
court.
i
should
like
once
more
to
request
the
court
not
to
accomplish
that
result
in
this
case
because
in
this
case
problem
does
not
present
itself
in
a
manner
in
which
that
result
could
be
accomplished
without
first
violating
the
precedents
of
this
court,
and
second
establishing
a
result
which
is
not
anticipated
nor
prayed
for
by
either
party.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
that's
a
difficult
case
to
answer
mr.
chief
justice
because
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
if
the
case
is
properly
here
and
if
in
the
context
in
which
it
is
here
this
court
can
extend
hanover
and
state
that
my
client
should
have
sent
a
simple
letter
within
the
context
in
which
this
constitutional
issue
is
presented
and
considering
but
that
is
not
petitioner's
argument
even
remotely
that
his
argument
is
that
the
state
laws
which
provide
actual
notice
were
not
complied
with
it
if
within
this
context
the
court
can
imply
--
can
apply
hanover
then
i
should
lose
the
case,
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
would.
but
again,
i
find
it
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
if
i
thought
mr.
justice
harlan
that
this
result
could
have
been
contemplated
and
anticipated
under
this
presentation
and
in
the
posture
in
which
this
case
now
stand,
i
have
no
doubt
that
there
will
be
amicus
briefs
filed
to
this
house
from
these
various
states
whose
statutes
would
be
struck
down
with
such
a
decision.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
again,
mr.
justice
harlan,
they
state
flatly
that
they're
not
trying
to
strike
down
any
state
statute.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
even
then
this
court
would
have
to
go
against
petitioner's
expressed
prayer
and
strike
down
at
least
by
implication
and
indeed
explicitly
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
arizona
in
the
sense
that
they
do
not
provide
for
actual
notice
which
is
not
petitioner's
argument
which
indeed
is
precisely
that
which
petitioner
does
not
argue.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
i
did
not
rest
on
encyclopedia,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
it
covers
it
precisely,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
indeed,
mr.
justice
white.
i
of
course
rest
on
--
mr.
n.
pike
johnson,
jr.
indeed,
that's
what
i
will
do,
mr.
justice
brennan.
