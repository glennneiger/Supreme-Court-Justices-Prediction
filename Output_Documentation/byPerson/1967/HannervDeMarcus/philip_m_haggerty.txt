mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
may
it
please
the
court.
honorable
chief
justice
i
regret
that
my
talents
of
narrative
and
description
are
probably
not
quite
equal
to
the
teller
mrs.
hanner
and
i
think
would've
been
more
appropriate
if
her
pleadings
have
perhaps
been
written
by
charles
dickens.
mrs.
hanner
attempted
to
secure
divorce
in
maricopa
county,
phoenix,
arizona
and
the
1959,
these
proceedings
were
held
as
a
result
of
the
somewhat
complicated
property
situation,
the
trial
court
evidently
felt
that
it
was
not
equal
to
the
accounting
practices
required
and
appointed
a
special
master.
the
respondent
herein
cecil
demarcus
to
assist
the
court
in
determining
what
her
property
was,
how
she
had
acquired
it
and
therefore
what
property
might
be
considered
her
property
and
what
the
community
property
of
herself
and
her
husband.
the
court
decided
in
the
spring
of
1959
that
the
special
master's
report
would
be
accepted
and
there's
this
customarily
and
accordance
with
rule
53
(a)
of
our
rules
which
is
of
course
the
duplicate
of
the
federal
rules
to
award
him
a
fee
in
the
amount
of
approximately
$5500.00.
it's
stated
at
that
time
that
if
this
fee
were
not
paid
by
mrs.
hanner
and
they
charged
entirely
to
her
within
60
days
that
he
could
have
execution
therefore
in
accordance
with
the
statute.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
she
was
a
party
to
the
case,
it
was
part
of
a
judgment
of
which
she
was
a
party
to
the
case
she
obviously
had
notice
of
it.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
60
days
was
time
that
set
by
the
trial
court.
60
days
is
also
the
time
limit
for
an
appeal
in
arizona
and
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona.
the
record
as
we
play
with
some
facts
to
the
effect
that
mrs.
hanner's
counsel
and
this
particular
cba
were
practicing
in
the
same
small
law
building
or
small
office
building
in
phoenix,
arizona
that
they
saw
each
of
the
constantly
that
no
reference
was
made
by
him
to
the
fact
that
he
might
be
proceeding
by
way
of
execution
and
by
one
affidavit
in
the
record
by
mrs.
hanner
herself
to
the
effect
that
she
was
affirmatively
advised
by
him
that
he
would
wait
the
results
of
the
appeal
of
the
divorce
action
before
any
steps
would
be
taken.
this
is
not
particularly
a
natural
in
view
of
the
fact
that
she
did
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
arizona,
the
court's
decision
that
she
had
to
pay
the
entire
amount
of
the
fee.
she
did
not
object
to
the
actual
dollars
and
cents
just
to
the
fact
that
her
husband
was
not
required
to
pay
any
of
it
at
all.
in
september
of
1959,
mr.
demarcus
without
any
notice
caused
the
writ
of
execution
to
be
issued
out
of
the
clerk's
office
delivered
to
the
sheriff
in
maricopa
county
and
levied
upon
her
real
properties
certain
portions
of
it
four
lots
located
in
a
commercial
street
in
phoenix,
arizona.
the
method
of
levy
is
set
forth
in
our
statute
and
noticed
in
our
brief
that
is
simply
by
filing
a
copy
of
the
writ
of
execution
with
the
county
recorder,
this
was
done.
there
is
a
requirement
that
execution
sales
be
advertised.
this
was
done.
three
copies
were
pointed
on
the
bulletin
boards
of
the
courthouse
at
maricopa
county.
i
assume
the
members
of
the
court
have
seen
courthouse
bulletin
boards
and
are
aware
the
general
condition
this
is
no
better
or
worst
than
any
other,
they're
hundreds
of
notices
posted
on
the
board.
notice
was
published
in
a
weekly
paper
which
is
devoted
almost
exclusively
and
entirely
to
legal
notices,
reprints
of
exact
articles
have
been
corporation
probate
proceedings
about
a
hundred
page
is
about
85
must
be
solid
legal
advertising.
mr.
demarcus
brought
the
property,
entered
execution
sale
for
the
amount
of
his
judgment
plus
some
dollars
which
apparently
were
cost
in
connection
with
the
execution
and
perhaps
interest
from
the
time
of
the
judgment.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
not
on
the
property
itself.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
it
is
not
required.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
this
is
the
system,
statutory
system.
it
is
what
is
the
law
requires
and
what
is
followed.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
pardon
me?
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no.
i
am
sure
there
are
many
other
states
that
have
similar
systems.
some
older
states
i
think
do
notice
the
property
itself.
this
is
an
older
requirement
but
it
is
not
followed
in
the
state
of
arizona.
we
do
have
a
requirement
of
statute
which
of
some
interest.
a
law
state
that
a
sheriff
on
an
execution
must
levy
upon
personal
property
before
he
levies
upon
real
property
and
a
writ
of
general
execution
and
that
was
the
writ
that
was
issued
in
this
case.
mr.
hanner
as
special
master
knew
that
his
now
judgment
credit
better
had
personal
property
the
value
maybe
in
dispute
but
it
was
certainly
there
and
may
very
well
have
been
an
excess
his
judgment
as
a
cpa
with
knowledge
of
all
her
books
and
records
to
a
greater
extent
than
even
a
lawyer
would
know.
he
knew
how
much
property
she
had
and
what
it
was
worth.
the
law
requires
also
that
a
judgment
better
may
point
out
to
the
levying
officer
the
property
he
desires
to
be
levied
on
it
and
if
the
officer
then
deems
it's
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
execution,
you
shall
make
levy
on
no
other
property.
mr.
demarcus
also
knew
by
reason
of
his
position
as
special
master
that
she
had
other
lots
of
real
property
available
in
the
county
maybe
worth
more
maybe
less,
some
incumbent
some
not
incumbent.
actually,
on
this
particular
piece
of
property,
two
other
parties
showed
up
as
having
an
interest
in
it
or
it
was,
we
don't
know
they
never
defend
the
quiet
title
action
so
evidently
they
didn't
think
it
was
much.
after
bidding
this
in
at
the
execution
sale,
he
waited
for
something
like
two
years
before
any
further
proceedings
were
taken.
during
all
this
time,
the
original
divorce
action
was
still
pending
in
the
arizona
supreme
court
and
the
question
of
whether
or
not
she
should
pay
the
entire
fee
or
whether
it
should
be
divided
between
her
and
her
husband
entire
fee
for
mr.
demarcus
and
still
been
ultimately
unresolved.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
it
is
probable
that
a
supersedeas
bond
could
have
been
issued
and
a
stay
issue.
it
is
not
particularly
common
to
issue
a
stay
of
execution
and
a
divorce
because
nothing
was
done
between
the
hanners
themselves.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
there
could've
been
stay,
a
stay
of
execution
could've
been
issued.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
there
are
two
reasons,
i
believe.one
is
that
she
states
she
was
advised
by
mr.
demarcus
and
he
wasn't
going
to
do
anything,
that
her
lawyer
was
seeing
him
daily.
they
just
plan
out
did
not
think
it
was
necessary.
they
did
not
believe
he
would
take
this
route.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
they
are
in
the
same
building
and
as
the
affidavit
submitted
and
even
the
deposition
note
they
saw
each
other
quite
often,
that's
about
a
six-story
office
building
there
are
maybe
40
offices
in
it
and
quite
a
fact
mr.
demarcus
was
the
choice
of
mrs.
hanner's
former
counsel
to
be
the
special
master,
they
knew
each
other.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
the
evidence
says
on
the
affidavit
of
mr.
levy
is
that
he
did
not
in
fact
know
that
he
was
as
surprised
as
mrs.
hanner.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
there
are
no
affidavits
of
that,
no
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
not
that
neither
mrs.
hanner
nor
her
counsel
were
ever
advised
and
that
there
was
certainly
opportunity
to
advise
them
that
these
steps
were
being
taken.
the
affidavits
which
sets
this
forth
and
was
submitted
to
the
superior
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
had
never
been
rebutted
on
this
or
never
challenged
factually.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
at
that
time
of
course
our
appeals
were
going
very
slow
and
slowly
in
civil
cases.
in
january
of
1964,
a
year
and
a
half
after
the
supply
of
title
action
was
brought.
the
case
was
decided
and
the
supreme
court
did
decide
that
since
she
actually
own
the
most
of
the
property,
she
should
pay
the
fee,
the
entire
fee.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
so
we
do
not
challenge
now
that
the
entire
fee
is
doomed.
mr.
demarcus,
there
was
one
dissent
on
that
issue
alone
but
that
merely
to
show
we
pointed
out
merely
to
show
that
the
supreme
court
did
consider
this
and
then
it
was
before
them,
the
division
of
the
fee.
we
believe
that
basically
her
rights
have
been
seriously
violated
for
several
reasons.
one
is
actually
peculiar
to
the
case.
the
fact
that
this
man
is
a
special
master
of
the
court,
he
sits
in
the
place
of
the
court
to
decide
contested
issues
before
him.
he
has
by
virtue
of
his
position
the
right
to
demand
and
did
in
fact
demand
and
investigate
all
of
the
books
and
records
and
belongings
of
mrs.
hanner.
they
were
apparently
extensive
and
judging
from
the
report
probably
in
pretty
bad
shape
that
he
knew
everything
about
her
property
more
than
almost
anybody
would,
and
that
although
technically
speaking,
he
was
advised
or
she
was
advised
that
a
writ
of
execution
could
issue
the
relationships
of
the
parties
were
such
that
this
was
a
totally
unexpected
result
and
that
he
affirmatively
misled.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
up
to
the
time
of
the
filing
of
a
quiet
title
action,
1962
she
did,
mr.
hanner
so
far
as
we
know.
the
tax
receipts
were
introduced
in
evidence.
thereafter,
i'm
not
sure
who
has
paid
them.
i
think
right
now
just
put
in.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
up
until
the
initiation
of
a
quiet
title
action
which
in
effect
to
deprived
her
with
the
property.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
in
theory,
that
should've
happen
that
way
but
in
practice
it
did
not
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
six
months
had
applied
and
that
expires
to
bring
him
up
until
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
if
they
took
notice
of
the
change
of
property
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
we
believe
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
directed
to
the
preservation
of
property
rights
as
well
as
individual
rights
and
that
this
question
was
raised
all
the
way
through
the
proceedings
that
this
court
has
previously
held
that
property
may
not
be
taken
without
due
process
and
that
notice
is
essential.
that
some
sort
of
notice
is
necessary.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
of
course
we
believe
it
can.
now,
if
the
state
law
had
been
properly
filed
--
followed
she
might
not
have
lost
her
property.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question
but
in
other
words
(voice
overlap)
state
court
fails
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes,
essentially
that
is
our
major
position.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no,
it
did
not
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
the
position
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
for
failure
to
provide
notice.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
that
is
apparently
what
justice
bronstein
said.
frankly
i
have
--
that
is
what
he
said,
frankly
i
have
some
difficulty
in
following
his
logic
(voice
overlap).
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
you
said
that
this
method
is
either
--
he
denied
that
this
method
is
either
vague
or
lacking
in
the
protections
guarantee
by
the
due
process.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
we
are
not
taking
the
position
that
rule
53
(a)
requires
any
particular
special
notice.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
instead
that
notice
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
i
think
we
have
a
problem
in
that.
53
(a)
just
refers
generally
to
execution
and
that
we
are
concerned
that
the
statutes
(voice
overlap)
relates
to
execution.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
that
is
what
we
are
holding.
that's
what
we're
saying
the
arizona
supreme
court
did
not
in
fact
really
go
in
to
the
arizona
cases
that
they
did
not
consider
the
procedure
that
happened.
we
believe
that
the
procedure
requires
notice
and
that
this
was
not
followed
and
that
this
is
what
is
in
error
that
the
supreme
court
was
procedurally
compounding
a
difficulty
that
never
should've
existed
if
the
statutes
have
been
followed
that
their
treatment
of
it
is
so
cursory
we
can't
even
say
that
they
held
that
no
notice
supplementary
notice
at
all
has
not
required.
they
merely
said
that,
no
notice
under
rule
53
is
not
required
but
that
they
did
not
consider
the
question
that
the
general
statutes
on
execution
do
not
require
notice.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
that
is
our
case.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
not
essentially
in
other
words,
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
if
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
in
saying
that
no
notice
is
required
meant
to
include
everything,
every
form
of
execution
not
just
an
execution
under
rule
53
(a)
then
we
think
that
they
are
clearly
wrong
and
that
their
position
is
just
not
only
in
contravention
of
our
own
statutes
but
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
we
do
not
believe
that
this
has
been
seriously
disputed
by
the
respondent
in
this
case.
he
disputes
the
method
or
the
fact
that
we
brought
up
to
these
issues
sufficiently
in
the
lower
court
not
as
to
win
on
myself
unfortunately
we're
connected
with
the
case
at
that
time.
we
believe
we
did
preserve
it
but
essentially
apparently
they
agreed
that
some
notice
after
judgment
at
least
in
this
type
of
case
is
required.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
takes
a
piece
of
paper
from
his
office
and
goes
to
the
county
recorder's
office
and
that's
it.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
that
would
be
general
procedure
under
any
writ
of
special
execution
in
any
case.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
the
sheriff
is
required
to
notice
the
property
for
sale.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
posting
at
the
county
court
house
and
a
publication
in
a
newspaper.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
anybody
(inaudible).
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
generally
six
months,
there
are
exceptions
in
our
cases.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
there
is
none.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes,
if
they
happen
to
see
him.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
not
essentially.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
in
many
states
except
some
require
posting
on
the
property
and
some
may
have
special
notice
provisions
but
generally
this
is
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
obviously,
the
sheriff
has
to
come
in
contact
with
him
somehow
or
other
before
the
writ
of
execution
and
the
levy
is
filed
with
the
county
recorder's
office.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no,
it
does
not
say
how
or
why
or
when
but
it
says
he
has
the
right
to
point
out
to
the
sheriff
the
property
that
he
desires
to
be
levied
upon.
and
as
i've
said
this
is
a
backhanded
way
providing
notice
but
we
do
not
believe
how
a
legislature
could
say
the
sheriff
has
to
have
this
property
pointed
out
and
then
say,
the
debtor
would
have
no
notice.
before
he
can
point
it
out
he
has
to
know
there
was
something
there.
a
debtor
may
have
50
pieces
of
property
may
have
property
worth
500
times,
he
may
have
one
piece
of
property.
but
the
law
gives
him
the
right
to
point
out
to
the
sheriff
the
property
he
desires
to
be
levied
on
and
the
law
also
requires
execution
on
personal
property
and
there's
a
great
deal
of
personal
property
which
would
never
be
carried
on
the
personal
property
tax
rules.
presumably,
he
can
tell
the
sheriff
that
he
has
personal
property
too.
our
supreme
court
in
the
earlier
case
the
blasinggame
case
said
this
must
be
done
that
the
statutes
mean
what
they
say
that
personal
property
has
to
be
levied
upon
first
it
was
not
a
case
of
between
choosing
lots
among
whatever
real
property
she
might
own
or
the
judgment
that
it
might
own.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
there
was
personal
property.
it
was
not
seized
first
until
the
supreme
court
said
that
sale
can
be
set
aside
between
the
two
parties.
obviously,
the
judgment
that
are
in
that
case
found
out
about
the
sale
fairly
shortly
after
it's
in
our
case
she
has
not
find
out
until
a
year
and
a
half
afterwards
and
with
the
inception
of
the
quiet
title
action.
any
liability
sought
against
the
sheriff
would
be
gone
by
then.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
that
they
are
just
completely
wrong.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
they
did
not
analyzed
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
basically,
it
ignored
it
and
the
wealth
of
other
matters
were
brought
up
they
just
never
considered
and
that
if
they
say
--
if
a
statute
provides
x,
y
and
z
and
if
the
court
says,
they
did
that
and
they
took
care
of
that
but
the
record
shows
in
fact
they
did
not.
i
don't
think
the
arizona
supreme
court
can
completely
foreclose
this
court
from
considering
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
by
merely
saying,
oh,
well,
it's
all
right
completely.
we
hold
that
everything
was
done
properly
even
though
the
record
shows
that
it
was
not
and
foreclose
this
court
from
reaching
any
decision
in
the
same
area
that
the
doctrine
of
judicial
restraint
does
not
go
that
far
and
we
do
not
believe.
i
see
i
have
five
minutes
left.
if
the
court
has
no
questions
i
would
like
to
reserve
that
time
if
i
may.
you
may
johnson.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
i
have
a
few
moments
left.
as
far
as
the
encyclopedia
press
case
is
concerned,
we
can
draw
at
least
one
distinction
in
that
case
the
parties
were
the
ones
directly
involved
and
i
think
there
is
a
slight
difference
that
if
john
jones
sues
bill
smith
and
wins,
smith
be
pretty
sure
that
jones
is
going
to
do
everything
in
site
to
collect.
we
believe
that
mr.
demarcus
in
this
case
is
not
a
party
to
the
action
and
that
there
is
at
least
some
reasonable
distinction
to
be
made
on
those
grants.
we
are
not
quite
so
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes,
but
he
is
not
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
it
holds
that
there
is
no
further
notice
required.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no.
their
fourteenth
amendment
would
not
require
sitting
by
itself
in
the
absence
of
any
other
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
well,
i
mean
no
state
statute.
it
was
not
addition.
we
believe
his
probably
he's
still
good
lawyer,
it
could
be.
we're
not
really
attacking
that
decision.
we
don't
necessarily
agree
that
it's
going
to
go
down
to
the
drain.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
they
are
saying
that
we
have
a
state
procedure
which
has
added
to
the
rights
which
a
litigant
in
an
arizona
court
may
expect
to
achieve.
and
when
it
has
added
to
these
rights,
they
become
part
of
the
rights
which
are
entitled
to
fourteenth
amendment
protection
and
that
they
may
not
be
disregarded
even
though
the
state
went
further
than
perhaps
the
fourteenth
amendment
might
have
initially
proceeded
as
being
a
fair
minimum.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
we
have
a
higher
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes
and
when
we
have
a
higher
we
(voice
overlap)
everyone
must
follow
at
least
within
the
state
of
arizona
that
we
have
established
a
procedure
to
which
all
must
adhere
and
with
this
it's
been
violated,
her
rights
have
been
violated
and
this
court
may
take
notice
of
it.
we
do
not
agree
with
the
respondent's
contention
that
a
motion
for
rehearing
is
outside
the
record,
this
case
just
simply
do
not
support
that.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
in
the
event
a
new
theory,
then
perhaps
you
are
too
late.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
in
the
superior
court,
it
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
superior
court
that
no
notice
was
ever
given.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
and
they
tried
to
argue
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
not
in
those
precise
words.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
principally
by
the
answer
itself
which
was
filed
in
the
action,
it's
part
of
the
answer,
it's
part
of
the
affidavit
and
reply
to
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
it's
part
of
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
in
the
superior
court,
it's
a
very
brief
record.
they
tried.
they
just
never
got
it
resolved.
the
emphasis
perhaps
was
not
as
clear
as
might
have
been.
unfortunately,
i
think
it's
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
sufficiently
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
they
should
have
realized
that
this
is
a
question
of
notice
and
loss
of
property,
three
times.
pardon
me?
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
not
entirely,
the
fact
that
he
was
an
officer
of
the
court
and
acting
under
the
court's
seal
as
a
special
state
action.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no,
basically
those
are
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes,
we
are
attacking
the
levy
without
notice.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes,
we
believe
anything
under
53
(a)
can
be
adequate
state
grounds,
it's
not
that
basic.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
that
is
the
heart
of
our
case.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
this,
we
feel
as
an
added
much
more
narrow
grounds
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
that
is
basically
our
case.t
thank
you.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
pardon
me?
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
well,
it
comes
a
point
i
suppose
when
the
violation
of
a
particular
state
is
sufficient
gravity
to
say
that
due
process
has
been
violated
but
basically
yes
that
when
the
state
establishes
a
denominator
it
must
adhere
to
it
however
low
or
high
the
common
denominator
maybe
and
that
the
violation
of
that
is
for
that
citizen
the
violation
the
due
process
and
which
this
court
may
take
notice
and
may
not
because
the
grounds
may
not
be
serious
but
it
is
a
possibility
and
it
can
so
act.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no,
not
in
those
terms.
not
as
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
black
went
through
it.
we
said
that
he
has
taken
--
we
are
still
basically
without
due
process.
we're
more
concerned
with
that
rather
than
equal
protection
although
the
two
so
intertwined
is
difficult
to
say
that
we're
standing
on
one
and
falling
on
the
other.
thank
you.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
may
it
please
the
court.
honorable
chief
justice
i
regret
that
my
talents
of
narrative
and
description
are
probably
not
quite
equal
to
the
teller
mrs.
hanner
and
i
think
would've
been
more
appropriate
if
her
pleadings
have
perhaps
been
written
by
charles
dickens.
mrs.
hanner
attempted
to
secure
divorce
in
maricopa
county,
phoenix,
arizona
and
the
1959,
these
proceedings
were
held
as
a
result
of
the
somewhat
complicated
property
situation,
the
trial
court
evidently
felt
that
it
was
not
equal
to
the
accounting
practices
required
and
appointed
a
special
master.
the
respondent
herein
cecil
demarcus
to
assist
the
court
in
determining
what
her
property
was,
how
she
had
acquired
it
and
therefore
what
property
might
be
considered
her
property
and
what
the
community
property
of
herself
and
her
husband.
the
court
decided
in
the
spring
of
1959
that
the
special
master's
report
would
be
accepted
and
there's
this
customarily
and
accordance
with
rule
53
(a)
of
our
rules
which
is
of
course
the
duplicate
of
the
federal
rules
to
award
him
a
fee
in
the
amount
of
approximately
$5500.00.
it's
stated
at
that
time
that
if
this
fee
were
not
paid
by
mrs.
hanner
and
they
charged
entirely
to
her
within
60
days
that
he
could
have
execution
therefore
in
accordance
with
the
statute.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
she
was
a
party
to
the
case,
it
was
part
of
a
judgment
of
which
she
was
a
party
to
the
case
she
obviously
had
notice
of
it.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
60
days
was
time
that
set
by
the
trial
court.
60
days
is
also
the
time
limit
for
an
appeal
in
arizona
and
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona.
the
record
as
we
play
with
some
facts
to
the
effect
that
mrs.
hanner's
counsel
and
this
particular
cba
were
practicing
in
the
same
small
law
building
or
small
office
building
in
phoenix,
arizona
that
they
saw
each
of
the
constantly
that
no
reference
was
made
by
him
to
the
fact
that
he
might
be
proceeding
by
way
of
execution
and
by
one
affidavit
in
the
record
by
mrs.
hanner
herself
to
the
effect
that
she
was
affirmatively
advised
by
him
that
he
would
wait
the
results
of
the
appeal
of
the
divorce
action
before
any
steps
would
be
taken.
this
is
not
particularly
a
natural
in
view
of
the
fact
that
she
did
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
arizona,
the
court's
decision
that
she
had
to
pay
the
entire
amount
of
the
fee.
she
did
not
object
to
the
actual
dollars
and
cents
just
to
the
fact
that
her
husband
was
not
required
to
pay
any
of
it
at
all.
in
september
of
1959,
mr.
demarcus
without
any
notice
caused
the
writ
of
execution
to
be
issued
out
of
the
clerk's
office
delivered
to
the
sheriff
in
maricopa
county
and
levied
upon
her
real
properties
certain
portions
of
it
four
lots
located
in
a
commercial
street
in
phoenix,
arizona.
the
method
of
levy
is
set
forth
in
our
statute
and
noticed
in
our
brief
that
is
simply
by
filing
a
copy
of
the
writ
of
execution
with
the
county
recorder,
this
was
done.
there
is
a
requirement
that
execution
sales
be
advertised.
this
was
done.
three
copies
were
pointed
on
the
bulletin
boards
of
the
courthouse
at
maricopa
county.
i
assume
the
members
of
the
court
have
seen
courthouse
bulletin
boards
and
are
aware
the
general
condition
this
is
no
better
or
worst
than
any
other,
they're
hundreds
of
notices
posted
on
the
board.
notice
was
published
in
a
weekly
paper
which
is
devoted
almost
exclusively
and
entirely
to
legal
notices,
reprints
of
exact
articles
have
been
corporation
probate
proceedings
about
a
hundred
page
is
about
85
must
be
solid
legal
advertising.
mr.
demarcus
brought
the
property,
entered
execution
sale
for
the
amount
of
his
judgment
plus
some
dollars
which
apparently
were
cost
in
connection
with
the
execution
and
perhaps
interest
from
the
time
of
the
judgment.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
not
on
the
property
itself.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
it
is
not
required.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
this
is
the
system,
statutory
system.
it
is
what
is
the
law
requires
and
what
is
followed.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
pardon
me?
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no.
i
am
sure
there
are
many
other
states
that
have
similar
systems.
some
older
states
i
think
do
notice
the
property
itself.
this
is
an
older
requirement
but
it
is
not
followed
in
the
state
of
arizona.
we
do
have
a
requirement
of
statute
which
of
some
interest.
a
law
state
that
a
sheriff
on
an
execution
must
levy
upon
personal
property
before
he
levies
upon
real
property
and
a
writ
of
general
execution
and
that
was
the
writ
that
was
issued
in
this
case.
mr.
hanner
as
special
master
knew
that
his
now
judgment
credit
better
had
personal
property
the
value
maybe
in
dispute
but
it
was
certainly
there
and
may
very
well
have
been
an
excess
his
judgment
as
a
cpa
with
knowledge
of
all
her
books
and
records
to
a
greater
extent
than
even
a
lawyer
would
know.
he
knew
how
much
property
she
had
and
what
it
was
worth.
the
law
requires
also
that
a
judgment
better
may
point
out
to
the
levying
officer
the
property
he
desires
to
be
levied
on
it
and
if
the
officer
then
deems
it's
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
execution,
you
shall
make
levy
on
no
other
property.
mr.
demarcus
also
knew
by
reason
of
his
position
as
special
master
that
she
had
other
lots
of
real
property
available
in
the
county
maybe
worth
more
maybe
less,
some
incumbent
some
not
incumbent.
actually,
on
this
particular
piece
of
property,
two
other
parties
showed
up
as
having
an
interest
in
it
or
it
was,
we
don't
know
they
never
defend
the
quiet
title
action
so
evidently
they
didn't
think
it
was
much.
after
bidding
this
in
at
the
execution
sale,
he
waited
for
something
like
two
years
before
any
further
proceedings
were
taken.
during
all
this
time,
the
original
divorce
action
was
still
pending
in
the
arizona
supreme
court
and
the
question
of
whether
or
not
she
should
pay
the
entire
fee
or
whether
it
should
be
divided
between
her
and
her
husband
entire
fee
for
mr.
demarcus
and
still
been
ultimately
unresolved.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
it
is
probable
that
a
supersedeas
bond
could
have
been
issued
and
a
stay
issue.
it
is
not
particularly
common
to
issue
a
stay
of
execution
and
a
divorce
because
nothing
was
done
between
the
hanners
themselves.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
there
could've
been
stay,
a
stay
of
execution
could've
been
issued.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
there
are
two
reasons,
i
believe.one
is
that
she
states
she
was
advised
by
mr.
demarcus
and
he
wasn't
going
to
do
anything,
that
her
lawyer
was
seeing
him
daily.
they
just
plan
out
did
not
think
it
was
necessary.
they
did
not
believe
he
would
take
this
route.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
they
are
in
the
same
building
and
as
the
affidavit
submitted
and
even
the
deposition
note
they
saw
each
other
quite
often,
that's
about
a
six-story
office
building
there
are
maybe
40
offices
in
it
and
quite
a
fact
mr.
demarcus
was
the
choice
of
mrs.
hanner's
former
counsel
to
be
the
special
master,
they
knew
each
other.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
the
evidence
says
on
the
affidavit
of
mr.
levy
is
that
he
did
not
in
fact
know
that
he
was
as
surprised
as
mrs.
hanner.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
there
are
no
affidavits
of
that,
no
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
not
that
neither
mrs.
hanner
nor
her
counsel
were
ever
advised
and
that
there
was
certainly
opportunity
to
advise
them
that
these
steps
were
being
taken.
the
affidavits
which
sets
this
forth
and
was
submitted
to
the
superior
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
had
never
been
rebutted
on
this
or
never
challenged
factually.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
at
that
time
of
course
our
appeals
were
going
very
slow
and
slowly
in
civil
cases.
in
january
of
1964,
a
year
and
a
half
after
the
supply
of
title
action
was
brought.
the
case
was
decided
and
the
supreme
court
did
decide
that
since
she
actually
own
the
most
of
the
property,
she
should
pay
the
fee,
the
entire
fee.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
so
we
do
not
challenge
now
that
the
entire
fee
is
doomed.
mr.
demarcus,
there
was
one
dissent
on
that
issue
alone
but
that
merely
to
show
we
pointed
out
merely
to
show
that
the
supreme
court
did
consider
this
and
then
it
was
before
them,
the
division
of
the
fee.
we
believe
that
basically
her
rights
have
been
seriously
violated
for
several
reasons.
one
is
actually
peculiar
to
the
case.
the
fact
that
this
man
is
a
special
master
of
the
court,
he
sits
in
the
place
of
the
court
to
decide
contested
issues
before
him.
he
has
by
virtue
of
his
position
the
right
to
demand
and
did
in
fact
demand
and
investigate
all
of
the
books
and
records
and
belongings
of
mrs.
hanner.
they
were
apparently
extensive
and
judging
from
the
report
probably
in
pretty
bad
shape
that
he
knew
everything
about
her
property
more
than
almost
anybody
would,
and
that
although
technically
speaking,
he
was
advised
or
she
was
advised
that
a
writ
of
execution
could
issue
the
relationships
of
the
parties
were
such
that
this
was
a
totally
unexpected
result
and
that
he
affirmatively
misled.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
up
to
the
time
of
the
filing
of
a
quiet
title
action,
1962
she
did,
mr.
hanner
so
far
as
we
know.
the
tax
receipts
were
introduced
in
evidence.
thereafter,
i'm
not
sure
who
has
paid
them.
i
think
right
now
just
put
in.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
up
until
the
initiation
of
a
quiet
title
action
which
in
effect
to
deprived
her
with
the
property.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
in
theory,
that
should've
happen
that
way
but
in
practice
it
did
not
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
six
months
had
applied
and
that
expires
to
bring
him
up
until
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
if
they
took
notice
of
the
change
of
property
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
we
believe
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
directed
to
the
preservation
of
property
rights
as
well
as
individual
rights
and
that
this
question
was
raised
all
the
way
through
the
proceedings
that
this
court
has
previously
held
that
property
may
not
be
taken
without
due
process
and
that
notice
is
essential.
that
some
sort
of
notice
is
necessary.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
of
course
we
believe
it
can.
now,
if
the
state
law
had
been
properly
filed
--
followed
she
might
not
have
lost
her
property.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question
but
in
other
words
(voice
overlap)
state
court
fails
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes,
essentially
that
is
our
major
position.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no,
it
did
not
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
the
position
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
for
failure
to
provide
notice.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
that
is
apparently
what
justice
bronstein
said.
frankly
i
have
--
that
is
what
he
said,
frankly
i
have
some
difficulty
in
following
his
logic
(voice
overlap).
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
you
said
that
this
method
is
either
--
he
denied
that
this
method
is
either
vague
or
lacking
in
the
protections
guarantee
by
the
due
process.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
we
are
not
taking
the
position
that
rule
53
(a)
requires
any
particular
special
notice.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
instead
that
notice
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
i
think
we
have
a
problem
in
that.
53
(a)
just
refers
generally
to
execution
and
that
we
are
concerned
that
the
statutes
(voice
overlap)
relates
to
execution.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
that
is
what
we
are
holding.
that's
what
we're
saying
the
arizona
supreme
court
did
not
in
fact
really
go
in
to
the
arizona
cases
that
they
did
not
consider
the
procedure
that
happened.
we
believe
that
the
procedure
requires
notice
and
that
this
was
not
followed
and
that
this
is
what
is
in
error
that
the
supreme
court
was
procedurally
compounding
a
difficulty
that
never
should've
existed
if
the
statutes
have
been
followed
that
their
treatment
of
it
is
so
cursory
we
can't
even
say
that
they
held
that
no
notice
supplementary
notice
at
all
has
not
required.
they
merely
said
that,
no
notice
under
rule
53
is
not
required
but
that
they
did
not
consider
the
question
that
the
general
statutes
on
execution
do
not
require
notice.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
that
is
our
case.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
not
essentially
in
other
words,
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
if
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
in
saying
that
no
notice
is
required
meant
to
include
everything,
every
form
of
execution
not
just
an
execution
under
rule
53
(a)
then
we
think
that
they
are
clearly
wrong
and
that
their
position
is
just
not
only
in
contravention
of
our
own
statutes
but
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
we
do
not
believe
that
this
has
been
seriously
disputed
by
the
respondent
in
this
case.
he
disputes
the
method
or
the
fact
that
we
brought
up
to
these
issues
sufficiently
in
the
lower
court
not
as
to
win
on
myself
unfortunately
we're
connected
with
the
case
at
that
time.
we
believe
we
did
preserve
it
but
essentially
apparently
they
agreed
that
some
notice
after
judgment
at
least
in
this
type
of
case
is
required.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
takes
a
piece
of
paper
from
his
office
and
goes
to
the
county
recorder's
office
and
that's
it.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
that
would
be
general
procedure
under
any
writ
of
special
execution
in
any
case.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
the
sheriff
is
required
to
notice
the
property
for
sale.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
posting
at
the
county
court
house
and
a
publication
in
a
newspaper.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
anybody
(inaudible).
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
generally
six
months,
there
are
exceptions
in
our
cases.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
there
is
none.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes,
if
they
happen
to
see
him.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
not
essentially.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
in
many
states
except
some
require
posting
on
the
property
and
some
may
have
special
notice
provisions
but
generally
this
is
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
obviously,
the
sheriff
has
to
come
in
contact
with
him
somehow
or
other
before
the
writ
of
execution
and
the
levy
is
filed
with
the
county
recorder's
office.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no,
it
does
not
say
how
or
why
or
when
but
it
says
he
has
the
right
to
point
out
to
the
sheriff
the
property
that
he
desires
to
be
levied
upon.
and
as
i've
said
this
is
a
backhanded
way
providing
notice
but
we
do
not
believe
how
a
legislature
could
say
the
sheriff
has
to
have
this
property
pointed
out
and
then
say,
the
debtor
would
have
no
notice.
before
he
can
point
it
out
he
has
to
know
there
was
something
there.
a
debtor
may
have
50
pieces
of
property
may
have
property
worth
500
times,
he
may
have
one
piece
of
property.
but
the
law
gives
him
the
right
to
point
out
to
the
sheriff
the
property
he
desires
to
be
levied
on
and
the
law
also
requires
execution
on
personal
property
and
there's
a
great
deal
of
personal
property
which
would
never
be
carried
on
the
personal
property
tax
rules.
presumably,
he
can
tell
the
sheriff
that
he
has
personal
property
too.
our
supreme
court
in
the
earlier
case
the
blasinggame
case
said
this
must
be
done
that
the
statutes
mean
what
they
say
that
personal
property
has
to
be
levied
upon
first
it
was
not
a
case
of
between
choosing
lots
among
whatever
real
property
she
might
own
or
the
judgment
that
it
might
own.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
there
was
personal
property.
it
was
not
seized
first
until
the
supreme
court
said
that
sale
can
be
set
aside
between
the
two
parties.
obviously,
the
judgment
that
are
in
that
case
found
out
about
the
sale
fairly
shortly
after
it's
in
our
case
she
has
not
find
out
until
a
year
and
a
half
afterwards
and
with
the
inception
of
the
quiet
title
action.
any
liability
sought
against
the
sheriff
would
be
gone
by
then.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
that
they
are
just
completely
wrong.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
they
did
not
analyzed
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
basically,
it
ignored
it
and
the
wealth
of
other
matters
were
brought
up
they
just
never
considered
and
that
if
they
say
--
if
a
statute
provides
x,
y
and
z
and
if
the
court
says,
they
did
that
and
they
took
care
of
that
but
the
record
shows
in
fact
they
did
not.
i
don't
think
the
arizona
supreme
court
can
completely
foreclose
this
court
from
considering
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
by
merely
saying,
oh,
well,
it's
all
right
completely.
we
hold
that
everything
was
done
properly
even
though
the
record
shows
that
it
was
not
and
foreclose
this
court
from
reaching
any
decision
in
the
same
area
that
the
doctrine
of
judicial
restraint
does
not
go
that
far
and
we
do
not
believe.
i
see
i
have
five
minutes
left.
if
the
court
has
no
questions
i
would
like
to
reserve
that
time
if
i
may.
you
may
johnson.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
i
have
a
few
moments
left.
as
far
as
the
encyclopedia
press
case
is
concerned,
we
can
draw
at
least
one
distinction
in
that
case
the
parties
were
the
ones
directly
involved
and
i
think
there
is
a
slight
difference
that
if
john
jones
sues
bill
smith
and
wins,
smith
be
pretty
sure
that
jones
is
going
to
do
everything
in
site
to
collect.
we
believe
that
mr.
demarcus
in
this
case
is
not
a
party
to
the
action
and
that
there
is
at
least
some
reasonable
distinction
to
be
made
on
those
grants.
we
are
not
quite
so
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes,
but
he
is
not
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
it
holds
that
there
is
no
further
notice
required.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no.
their
fourteenth
amendment
would
not
require
sitting
by
itself
in
the
absence
of
any
other
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
well,
i
mean
no
state
statute.
it
was
not
addition.
we
believe
his
probably
he's
still
good
lawyer,
it
could
be.
we're
not
really
attacking
that
decision.
we
don't
necessarily
agree
that
it's
going
to
go
down
to
the
drain.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
they
are
saying
that
we
have
a
state
procedure
which
has
added
to
the
rights
which
a
litigant
in
an
arizona
court
may
expect
to
achieve.
and
when
it
has
added
to
these
rights,
they
become
part
of
the
rights
which
are
entitled
to
fourteenth
amendment
protection
and
that
they
may
not
be
disregarded
even
though
the
state
went
further
than
perhaps
the
fourteenth
amendment
might
have
initially
proceeded
as
being
a
fair
minimum.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
we
have
a
higher
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes
and
when
we
have
a
higher
we
(voice
overlap)
everyone
must
follow
at
least
within
the
state
of
arizona
that
we
have
established
a
procedure
to
which
all
must
adhere
and
with
this
it's
been
violated,
her
rights
have
been
violated
and
this
court
may
take
notice
of
it.
we
do
not
agree
with
the
respondent's
contention
that
a
motion
for
rehearing
is
outside
the
record,
this
case
just
simply
do
not
support
that.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
in
the
event
a
new
theory,
then
perhaps
you
are
too
late.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
in
the
superior
court,
it
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
superior
court
that
no
notice
was
ever
given.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
and
they
tried
to
argue
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
not
in
those
precise
words.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
principally
by
the
answer
itself
which
was
filed
in
the
action,
it's
part
of
the
answer,
it's
part
of
the
affidavit
and
reply
to
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
it's
part
of
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
in
the
superior
court,
it's
a
very
brief
record.
they
tried.
they
just
never
got
it
resolved.
the
emphasis
perhaps
was
not
as
clear
as
might
have
been.
unfortunately,
i
think
it's
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
sufficiently
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
they
should
have
realized
that
this
is
a
question
of
notice
and
loss
of
property,
three
times.
pardon
me?
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
not
entirely,
the
fact
that
he
was
an
officer
of
the
court
and
acting
under
the
court's
seal
as
a
special
state
action.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no,
basically
those
are
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes,
we
are
attacking
the
levy
without
notice.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes,
we
believe
anything
under
53
(a)
can
be
adequate
state
grounds,
it's
not
that
basic.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
that
is
the
heart
of
our
case.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
this,
we
feel
as
an
added
much
more
narrow
grounds
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
that
is
basically
our
case.t
thank
you.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
pardon
me?
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
well,
it
comes
a
point
i
suppose
when
the
violation
of
a
particular
state
is
sufficient
gravity
to
say
that
due
process
has
been
violated
but
basically
yes
that
when
the
state
establishes
a
denominator
it
must
adhere
to
it
however
low
or
