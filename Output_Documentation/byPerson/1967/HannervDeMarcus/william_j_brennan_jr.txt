justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
there
been
a
stay
of
this
execution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean
in
so
far
as
is
this
word,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
a
reason
why
one
wasn't
sought?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
say
that
her
lawyer
and
mr.
demarcus
shared
an
office
together?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
anything
to
indicate
whether
the
lawyer
knew
that
he
was
about
to
levy
this
execution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
contested
by
counsel
to
the
other
side?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
that
appeal
ever
been
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
arizona?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
i
don't
understand
that.
if
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
accurately,
i'm
looking
at
page
25
of
the
appendix,
the
argument
dealt
with
by
that
court
was
whether
your
law
required
any
notice
that
is
where
the
rule
53
(a)
and
the
holding
was
that
your
law
did
not
require
any
notice
as
i
read
it,
am
i
wrong
in
this
25
and
26
and
that
therefore
the
failure
to
give
notice
did
not
stand
in
the
way
of
a
summary
judgment.
i
thought
your
question
here
was
whether
a
statute
which
did
not
quite
require
the
giving
of
notice
in
these
circumstances
is
unconstitutional.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
your
position
on
that
on
the
federal
issue?
first
of
all,
do
i
read
this
opinion
correctly?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
maybe
so
but
so
far
as
we're
concerned
we
have
to
accept
it
that
under
arizona
law
and
no
notice
was
required,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
does
this
mean?
they,
i
gather
you
argue
that
rule
53
(a)
imposes
such
a
notice
requirement,
we
disagree.
a
careful
reading
of
rule
makes
it
evident
that
the
word
"notice"
refers
to
a
notice
to
the
debtor
whose
obligation
that
the
rule
does
not
then
further
require
a
notice
of
an
intent
to
execute
what's
notification
the
judgment
has
probably
given,
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
i
don't
suppose
if
notice
is
required
that
be
a
quite
an
argument
that
this
wasn't
whatever
done
here
was
notice.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
we
can't
--
we
can't
be
concerned.
can
we
here
with
the
rightness
or
wrongness
as
a
matte
of
state
law
of
what
your
supreme
court
held?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
concluded
by,
aren't
we
and
don't
you
have
to
argue
this
case
on
the
premise
that
the
holding
of
the
supreme
court
that
no
notice
was
required
at
all
under
any
circumstances,
did
or
did
not
violate
the
requirements
of
due
process.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
do
you
do
with
this
holding
of
your
supreme
court?
we
conclude
that
the
plaintiff
acted
entirely
within
his
right
as
prescribed
by
a
statute.
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
maybe
but
they
just
didn't
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
the
point
is
mr.
haggerty,
how
--
you've
been
arguing
that
they
didn't
execute
properly,
they
should've
executed
against
personal
property
but
your
supreme
court
tells
us
and
that's
why
a
holding
that
i
suggest
concludes
us
that
this
plaintiff
did
everything
that
the
statutes
of
arizona
require
them
to
do
and
affirm
to
summary
judgment
and
among
the
other
things
they
said
was,
he
did
not
have
to
give
a
notice
before
he
execute.
and
i
don't
know
why
your
case
doesn't
come
down
to
whether
or
not
that
holding
failed
you
to
give
notice.
does
it
or
does
not
violates
the
due
process
clause
of
the
constitution
and
that's
all
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
did
you
--
i
gather
looking
at
your
objection
of
the
motion
for
rehearing
what
did
you
mean
--
what
does
this
mean?
the
motion
is
that
the
notice
requirement
of
rule
53
(a)
was
not
complied
with
and
you
go
on
to
your
argument,
is
this
matter
has
been
met
squarely
by
the
supreme
court
in
its
original
decision
that
is
therefore
not
a
proper
subject
of
rehearing.
is
this
--
does
it
suggests
that
the
supreme
court
in
fact
found
that
rule
--
the
notice
to
criminal
rule
53
(a)
was
complied
with?
is
that
what
you
meant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
see.
i
notice
now
the
second
ground
on
your
opposition
to
the
motion
for
rehearing
states
that
the
plaintiff
ask
for
the
rehearing
in
the
ground
that
there
were
defects
on
the
levy
or
an
action
is
taken
by
the
sheriff
and
you
go
on
and
argue
against
that
that
these
matters
were
not
included
in
appellant's
presentation
the
supreme
court
on
its
original
decision
and
therefore
have
no
proper
place
and
a
motion
for
rehearing
and
you
cite
an
arizona
decision.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
climate
control.
now,
is
that
to
say
that
you
read
the
denial
of
a
rehearing
as
on
the
ground
not
because
this
issue
was
not
raised
initially
they
were
under
climate
control
they
were
not
entitled
to
be
heard
by
the
supreme
court,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
them
it's
an
adequate
state
ground
here
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
disposes
of
under
your
authority
we
have
to
deal
with
this
constitutional
levy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
why
your
answer
isn't
--
i
rest
then
on
encyclopedia.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
not?
that's
been
overruled,
it's
still
in
the
books
and
i
certainly
reading
it,
it
seems
to
cover
your
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
at
least
don't
you
rest
on
it
what
its
worth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there
was
a
judgment
in
his
favor,
wasn't
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
doesn't
encyclopedia
hold
that
constitutionally
there's
no
notice
of
execution
required
if
he
have
notice
for
judgment,
isn't
that
what
it
holds?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right,
if
you
--
the
constitution
doesn't
require
further
notice
if
he
have
notice
to
the
judgment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
what's
a
fair
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
you're
not
that
i
must
say
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

--
more
than
what
the
constitution
or
otherwise
require
but

justice
william
j.

you
in
this
case
has
denied

equal

of

is
that
your
