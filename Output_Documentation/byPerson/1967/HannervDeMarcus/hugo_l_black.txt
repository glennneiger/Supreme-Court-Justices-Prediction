justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
what
is
your
standard
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
your
chief
objection
up
to
date
have
been
--
have
failed
to
follow
state
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
way
they
executed
this
levy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
arguing
that
failure
to
follow
state
law
constitutes
the
violation
of
due
process?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
she
wouldn't
have
lost
the
property
as
i
understand
you
if
they
had
evaded
state
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
--
if
you
present
the
case
here
it
presents
a
question
that
i
think
it's
not
been
here
before
whether
it's
a
violation
of
due
process
for
litigants
to
fail
of
a
court
--
state
court
to
fail
to
follow
a
state
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
basic
argument
is
statute
of
arizona
required
certain
things
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
order
or
to
be
illegal,
these
things
were
not
done
as
required
by
state
law.
is
the
only
question
you
present
whether
this
violation
of
state
law
amounts
in
itself
the
violation
of
due
process?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
few?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
that
when
the
state
passes
law
which
gives
certain
protection
to
the
party,
the
due
process
clause
requires
that
if
we
decide
this
case,
we
decide
it
according
the
law,
so
that
means
that
they
should
observe
state
law
on
all
cases
and
not
just
on
some,
is
that
it?
