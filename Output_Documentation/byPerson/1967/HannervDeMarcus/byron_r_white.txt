was
this

did
you
say
there
was
posting
on
the
property?
justice
byron

white
is
that
required?
justice
byron

white
and
is
this
--
this
system
you
described
is
not
in
characteristic
in
state
execution
and
in
foresales,
does
it?
justice
byron

white
and
not
only
in
arizona?
justice
byron

white
this
isn't
just
peculiar
to
arizona,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
the
trade
--
a
deed
does
an
issue
immediately
after
the
sale
i
would
suppose
that
a
period
to
redemption
as
to
around
that
--
justice

white
as
soon
as
the
deed
issued
and
was
recorded
then
the
tax
collected
--
to
be
collected
from
another
person.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
they
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
--
the
question
when
you
present
here
however
in
your
paper,
in
your
petition
for
certiorari,
in
your
brief
is
whether
or
not
it's
the
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
permit
execution
without
notice
and
i
thought
that
was
a
question
we
have
whether
the
state
procedure
doesn't
require
a
separate
notice
when
you
execute
after
judgment
and
addition
to
notice
the
suit
itself
whether
that's
constitutional
because
state
court
didn't
decide
that
notice
was
required
and
that
this
was
just
have
to
make
that
notice
just
said
notice
wasn't
required
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
maybe
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me
get
this
--
let
me
get
this
straight.
you're
saying
that
constitutionally
post-judgment
notice
execution
is
not
required.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
was
constitutionally
required
you
don't
contend,
do
you,
that
the
notice
given
in
this
case
was
sufficient?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
constitution
required
notice
of
sale
as
well
as
of
the
original
suit,
the
notice
was
given
here
wasn't
sufficient,
was
it
under
schroeder
cases
and
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
saying
yes
but
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
no
but?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
all
i'm
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
they
didn't
though,
don't
you
still
if
that
encyclopedia
case
is
good
law
about
whether
or
not
--
no
notice
is
required
for
execution?
that
case,
seems
to
have
held
that
you
don't
need
a
separate
notice
for
execution
after
judgment
as
long
as
you
had
notice
of
the
judgment,
if
that's
a
good
law,
isn't
the
case
over
whether
or
not
state
law
was
complied
with
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
the
state
law
required
actual
notice
and
it
was
ignored?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
maybe
it
was
on
his
way
to
being
overruled,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
why
you're
spending
so
much
time
on
the
argument
that
anyway
the
issue
wasn't
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
take
it
you
also
agree,
and
i'll
go
back
to
the
question
awhile
ago
that
if
notice
is
required
here
what
was
given
was
insufficient?
justice
byron

white
executions.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
for
all
you
know
there
were
only
four
people
granted.
