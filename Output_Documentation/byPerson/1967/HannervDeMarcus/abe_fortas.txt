justice
abe
fortas
precisely,
what
happens
under
your
arizona
procedures?
the
sheriff
levies
execution
on
real
property.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
is
general
procedure
not
only
under
53
(a).
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
the
county
recorder
or
whatever
it
is
records
that
execution
has
been
levied
on
such
and
such
a
property.
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
happens
next
to
what
are
the
rights?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
--
how
does
he
notice
of
this?
he
give
notice
to
the
former
owner
or
he
just
notice
by
publication
or
posting?
justice
abe
fortas
but
nothing
is
served
on
the
owner?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
the
sheriff
sale
takes
place
and
then
somebody
buys
in
the
property.
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
there's
a
period
of
redemption,
is
there?
justice
abe
fortas
and
is
there
any
provision
for
notification
to
the
owner
or
former
owner
at
that
time?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
he
is
just
supposed
to
get
notice
from
the
publication.
justice
abe
fortas
is
this
procedure
different
from
the
procedure
prevailing
another
states?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
where
it
works
all
over,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
you
agree
with
that
--
with
the
contention
that's
the
way
the
statute
properly
construe
works
that
is
to
say
sheriff
is
advised
to
levy
execution
and
then
that
statute
means
that
the
sheriff
has
to
go
to
the
debtor
and
sell
on
which
property
should
i
levy
execution.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
way
it
should
work
and
then
it
didn't
happen
in
this
case.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
interested
in
that
at
the
moment
but
as
i
understand
it
then
what
you're
saying
is
that
petitioner
has
not
presented
to
this
court
a
constitutional
issue
that
petitioner
has
urged
upon
this
court
that
petitioner's
rights
were
violated
because
petitioner
did
not
received
notice.
the
notice
of
petitioner
was
entitled
to,
was
notice
provided
by
arizona
statutory
scheme,
namely
that
the
sheriff
upon
being
told
to
levy
execution
should
go
to
the
debtor
and
ascertain
the
debtor's
preferences
as
to
the
property
upon
which
execution
should
be
levied.
is
that
the
submission?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
i
understand
your
point
cuts
a
little
deeper
than
that,
you're
saying
that
this
is
an
objection
that
should've
been
made,
point
that
should've
made
at
the
trial
stage
and
the
action
of
quiet
title
so
that
you
can
then
make
a
record,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you're
saying
that
it
wasn't
made
until
the
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
appellate
court
and
there
is
no
record
of
what
actually
happened
whether
the
sheriff
did
or
did
not
notified
the
debtor,
is
that
your
point?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
you're
really
saying
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
counsel
never
said
that
the
--
has
a
defense
to
the
action
of
quiet
title
that
the
levy
of
execution
was
unlawful
because
as
shown
by
this
affidavit
the
sheriff
failed
to
notify
the
judgment
debtor,
is
that
your
point?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
first
time
you
may
--
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
agree
that
the
first
time
that
the
point
was
made
below
was
on
the
motion
for
rehearing,
that
is
the
point
to
which
i'm
referring
being
that
the
execution
should
be
set
aside
for
failure
of
the
sheriff
to
discuss
with
the
judgment
debtor
or
as
the
judgment
debtor
about
which
prompt
should
be
levied
on
first.
justice
abe
fortas
but
did
--
where
is
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
was
a
legal
argument
made
or
was
not?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
when
you
say
it
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
superior
court,
do
you
mean
otherwise
and
by
the
narration
and
the
affidavit?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
you
are
contending
(voice
overlap)
before
it
was
made
the
trial.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
know
what
that
means
when
you
put
that
way
without
looking
at
the
record
myself
again
and
satisfy
myself.
now,
let
me
ask
you
one
further
question.
your
adversary
says
that
your
contention
is
that
because
of
the
failure
of
the
sheriff
to
follow
the
proscribed
procedure
with
respect
to
the
designation
of
the
property
upon
which
execution
is
to
be
levied,
it
is
your
contention
that
the
--
your
fourteenth
amendment
rights
were
violated.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
your
whole
submission
that
that
was
the
vice
in
this
proceeding?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
first
then
next
that
he
was
an
officer
of
the
court
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
there
anything
else?
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
is
the
statute
providing
before
the
levy
of
execution
without
notice.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
not
attacking
that?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
you're
not
--
are
you
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
53
(a)?
justice
abe
fortas
or
what
you're
attacking
is
the
failure
of
the
sheriff
to
follow
the
procedure
specified
in
arizona's
execution
statute,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
you're
not
attacking
53
(a),
it's
a
failure
to
give
notice
or
to
notify
the
judgment
debtor
as
provided
in
arizona's
execution
statutes?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
second
point
is
that
that
was
unconstitutional
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
the
judgment
creditor
was
an
officer
of
the
court.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
your
case?
justice
abe
fortas
precisely,
what
happens
under
your
arizona
procedures?
the
sheriff
levies
execution
on
real
property.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
is
general
procedure
not
only
under

justice
abe
fortas
and
then
the
county

or
whatever
it
is

that
execution
has
been
levied
on
such
and
such
a
property.
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
happens
next
to
what
are
the
rights?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
--
how
does
he
notice
of
this?
he
give
notice
to
the
former
owner
or
he
just
notice
by
publication
or

justice
abe
fortas
but
nothing

justice
abe
fortas
and
then

abe

and

there?
justice
abe
fortas
and
is
there
any
provision
for
notification
to
the
owner
or
former
owner
at
that
time?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
he
is

from
the
publication.
justice
abe
fortas
is
this
