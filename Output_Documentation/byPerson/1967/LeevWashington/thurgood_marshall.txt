you
draw
a
line
between
“racial

and
“racial

justice
thurgood
marshall
at
this
late
date?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.

what
was
reason
for
the
statute
which
is
before
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
reason,
“did
the
legislature
have
to
pass
had
statute
other
than
a
firm
belief
in
segregation.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
the
statute
in
form.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
didn't
have
muslims
then,
did
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
will
these
prisons
be
in
effect?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so
alabama

abolished
old
segregation
in

justice
thurgood
marshall
and
why

justice
thurgood

it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn't

justice
thurgood

my
point
is
if

good
why

go

the
district
court
ask
them
to
give
you
another
year
on
your
proven
word
that
you
will
desegregate
by
1969?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i
mean
is
you
are
sure
that
segregation
will
be
abolished
in
all
prisons
in
alabama
by
1969?
