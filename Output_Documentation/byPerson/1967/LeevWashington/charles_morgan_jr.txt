mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
of
course
arises
from
the
district
court
in
the
middle
district
of
alabama.
i
know
of
no
case
where
the
district
court
has
exercised
its
discretion
more
soundly
and
has
relied
more
upon
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
before
it,
who
were
the
defendants
in
the
case.
in
fact,
the
defendants
in
this
case
wrote
their
own
order.
the
district
court
participated
in
questioning
at
some
length
to
a
great
extent
of
the
witnesses
in
the
case
bu
both
judge
reeves
and
judge
johnson.
the
witnesses
in
the
case
responded
that
there
would
be
no
problem.
as
a
matter
of
fact
robert
austin
testified
in
birmingham,
he
said
that
the
warden
of
the
birmingham
jail
said,
his
only
problem
with
the
drunk
tank.
it
was
only
his
word,
the
court
gave
him
the
drunk
tank.
the
court
went
down
the
line
and
established
a
pattern
and
a
time
table
for
desegregation.
they
answered
if
they're
not
be
placed
under
injunction
the
court
issued
no
injunction.
the
court
simply
issued
an
order
and
sent
to
the
commissioner
of
correction.
it
said,
would
you
please
report
to
the
court
every
three
months
and
tell
us
what
progress
you're
making.
of
course,
the
commissioner
of
correction's
can
do
this,
in
all
towns
of
over
10,000
but
he
cannot
do
it
in
towns
of
other
10,000,
he
says,
unless
ordered
by
the
government.
the
government
of
alabama
appoints
the
board
of
corrections.
mr.
lee
is
the
responsible
state
official,
responsible
for
administering
state
law
that
over
100
years
have
discriminated
these
negroes.
and
what
this
case
is,
is
simply
one
more
case
in
a
long
series
of
cases
to
abolish
a
dual
system
of
justice
in
the
south
and
to
a
degree
in
the
nation.
this
is
the
end
of
the
system
of
justice.
for
those
who
live
instead
of
die
in
alabama
be
segregated
instrumentality
of
justice
which
is
of
electric
chair.
prior
to
this
time,
negroes
to
a
greater
and
greater
degree
are
becoming
able
to
participate
in
a
color
blind
system
of
justice
and
a
color
blind
court
house.
that
day
has
not
yet
come.
now,
may
i
refer
the
court
to
page
183
and
184
of
the
record?
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i'm
--
that's
exactly
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
now
from
the
record
itself.
page
183
and
184,
judge
reeves
said,
who
would
look
–
who
would
we
look
to
for
reports
from
the
county
in
city
jails?
could
your
department
make
these
reports?
this
is
to
commissioner
lee.
witness:
yes,
sir.
judge
reeves:
who
would
we
--
then
he
goes
on.
this
is
some
of
the
planning
that
we
have
been
doing
in
anticipation
of
something
like
this.
i
see,
says
judge
reeves.
witness:
we
can
do
that
sir.
now,
we
can
move
over
now
in
the
record
to
page
1
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
--
what
is
say
is
judge
reeves
and
judge
johnson
in
recognition
of
the
discretion
that
must
be
vested
in
prison
officials.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
have
–
yes,
has
relied
upon
their
discretion.
they
exercise
the
discretion,
the
suggestion
that
they
made
to
the
court,
more
explicitly
on
page
166
to
160
of
the
record.
question:
judge
reeves,
mr.
madison
will
you
bring
out
from
mr.
lee
to
what
extent
his
conduct
this
commissioner
brief
is
influenced
by
statutes
waiting
segregation
of
prevalence.
and
followed
down
there
and
a
question
comes
up
and
he
says,
in
that
event,
how
long
in
your
judgment
would
you
need
to
follow
the
direction
of
the
court
in
that
respect?
answer:
this
would
be
most
difficult
for
me
to
answer
but
i
would.
we
--
we
might
do
it
a
month.
we
might
do
it
in
two
months.
it
could,
it
might
take
a
year.
it
all
depends
on
when.
i
don't
know
just
how
this
will
be
received.
i
will
be
quite
frankly,
you
got
some
who
will
like,
some
will
dislike.
we
would
make
every
effort
to
make
it
--
make
it
function,
but
i
would
hate
to
think
that
we
--
we
would
have
to
do
it
for
less
than
a
years
time
even
though
if
we
would
get
such
an
order
where
we
would
start
tomorrow.
they
asked
for
a
year
and
the
court
gave
them
a
year
as
far
as
its
maximum
security
institution
was
concerned.
the
court
gave
six
months
as
far
as
minimum
and
medium
security
institutions
were
concerned.
the
court
said,
in
your
honor
forms
and
honor
camps
and
your
educational
institutions
immediate
desegregation.
the
court
said
for
the
county
jails
and
the
party
who
were
sued
as
representative
of
the
class
of
sheriffs,
eldon
bailey
is
not
the
appellant
in
this
case.
these
are
67
county
jails.
commissioner
lee
has
no
jail
and
his
county
had
seven
county
jails.
there
are
some
as
we
say
one
room
calabooses
in
--
in
some
of
these
towns.
we
don't
know
the
number
because
we've
attempt
ascertain
that
for
purpose
of
argument.
we
have
some
figures
but
i
doubt
if
they
are
accurate.
but
what's
happened
here
is
in
the
country
jails?
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
mr.
bailey
had
a
month
consider
the
--
rather
six
months
as
to
the
other
county
sheriffs.
and
the
jobs
in
county
jail,
we'll
turn
to
page
196
of
the
record,
you'll
find
judge
reeves
asking
a
question
of
the
following
questions.
mr.
austin,
the
warden
of
the
birmingham
city
jail,
he
says,
mr.
austin,
as
i
understand
your
whole
chief
concerned
about
integrating
is
this
to
your
drunk
tank.
witness:
yes,
sir,
definitely
sir.
judge
reeves:
and
you,
you
don't
have
much
problem
except
as
to
that?
witness:
any
foreseeable
problem,
i
think
i
could
work
the
other
out
at
a
given
time.
now,
the
posed
problem
is
a
problem
of
riots
in
prisons.
we've
had
far
fewer
riots
in
prisons
than
we've
had
out
of
prisons.
one
of
the
reasons
perhaps
that
we
do
have
riots
maybe
the
negroes
do
not
feel
that
they
can
take
their
struggle
out
to
the
streets
and
into
the
courts.
and
one
of
the
reasons
that's
wrong
predicament
is
because
that
court
house
in
the
deep
south
is
always
represented
to
them
and
an
instrumentality
of
regression.
all
we're
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
affirm
the
lower
court
decision
and
this
is
the
lower
court,
the
middle
district
of
alabama
about
which
this
court
said
in
reynolds
versus
sims
that
they
had
exercised
an
appropriate
well-considered
exercise
of
judicial
power.
this
court
has
been
as
flexible
as
any
court
has
been.
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
the
wardens
of
these
jails
come
back
to
the
court
and
they
say
we
have
this
particular
problem,
the
court
would
say,
fine,
we'll
work
it
out.
commissioner
lee
had
done
it
so.
this
case
was
tried
in
1966,
and
some
of
the
problems
that
didn't
exist
in
the
record
in
1966
when
the
record
was
made
apparently
exist
now.
i
don't
know
where
they
come
from.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
it
has.
application
for
the
state
of
the
district
of
court
was
made.
the
district
court
gave
20
days
in
order
for
this
court
to
grant
stay
with
this
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
sir.
not
to
my
knowledge.
it
has
not
gone
into
the
effect
if
didn't
strike
court
jury.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge
but
i
could
represent
either
way
on
that
your
honor.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
you
did.
you
state
–
the
district
court
denied
the
state
in
giving
20
days,
mr.
justice
black
referred
to
the
full
court
as
i
recall
it.
the
court
stayed
that
and
again
except
that
fourth
petition
here.
i
want
to
point
out
this,
when
you
talked
about
conditions
in
jail
and
it
represented
the
state
so
too.
i
have
no
doubt
that
what
was
stated
in
--
in
brown
v.
board
about
separate
being
inherently
only
applies
to
a
consummately
greater
degree
in
a
prison
system.
in
a
prison
system
there
may
well
be
packed
and
overcrowded
than
it's
high
time
in
the
state
of
alabama
provided
a
--
provided
a
prison
system
that
is
not
over
packed
and
overcrowded
and
provided
one
that
is
fair
and
equal
across
the
board.
well
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
--
i
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
made
a
little
study
of
that
as
best
we
could.
it's
sort
of
a
telephone
survey
over
a
couple
of
places
there
and
one
of
them
was
walker
county
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
walker
county,
yes.
in
walker
county,
you
don't
have
a
municipal
jail
as
i
understand
they
have
over
two
rooms,
most
of
them
with
one
room.
the
--
most
of
the
prisoners
of
course
go
to
the
county
jail
in
jasper.
you
have
municipal
jails
of
walker
county
in
carbon
hill,
cordova,
dora,
nauvoo,
oakland,
parish
and
simpson.
each
of
those
jails
almost
all
of
those
towns,
they
have
one
room.
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
segregate
when
you
have
only
one
cell.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
they
are
the
ones
they
call
calabooses,
yes,
sir.
i
i
want
to
make
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
he
could
put
this
way
but
i
record
to
those
–
in
those
small
town
but
i
guess
they
just
haven't
had
a
negro
and
white
man
dropped
on
the
same
time,
but
that
i
don't
know.[laughter]
we
--
we
make
no
contention
here
if
the
prison
officials
should
be
in
that
discretion
to
protect
prisoners.
as
dr.
king
went
back
to
the
[inaudible]
jail
with
which
mr.
justice
black
is
probably
more
familiar
with
many
men
at
least
historically.
there's
no
question
in
my
mind,
there
are
certain
kinds
of
prisoners
that
you
wouldn't
want
dr.
king
to
be
confined
with
and
there's
not
a
thing
in
this
decree
of
this
court
that
prevents
the
exercise
of
responsible
discretion
by
responsible
officials
in
a
nondiscriminatory
manner.
i
want
to
point
out
the
same
discretion
that
prison
officials
want
today
was
the
discretion
denied
to
them
by
law
and
made
a
misdemeanor
for
almost
a
hundred
years.
we
ask
this
court
to
strike
down
self-fulfilling
prophecy.
we
ask
this
court
to
strike
down
racial
discrimination
in
the
prisons
of
the
united
states
and
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
below.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
so
the
principle
difference
we
have
i
think
is
this
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
not
really
because
i
think
my
--
the
opposition
adapts
a
position
and
since
the
opposition
used
the
word
i
think
just
playing
common
sense
judge.
now,
the
plain
common
sense
judgment
says
this
case
could
not
arise
[inaudible]
out
of
alabama.
the
prison
commissioner
is
appointed
by
the
governor
of
alabama.
the
governor
of
alabama
has
stood
in
school
house
doors
but
not
yet
jail
house
doors.
and
the
fact
remains
that
i
don't
believe
that
a
man
in
alabama
in
public
office
subject
to
appointees
of
the
government,
can
in
fact
exercise
his
discretion
and
his
duty
without
an
order
of
the
court.
i
think
we
get
to
that
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
oh,
yes,
if
--
if
the
order
stated
that.
i
--
i
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
it's
rather
conceivable
that
it
does
but
we
referred
--
very
open
to
me
and
this
district
court
is
you
know
it's
in
the
same
city
with
commissioner
lee.
they're
not
far
away.
they
know
the
condition
and
the
circumstances
there,
it's
totally
reasonable
court.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
in
the
record
i
think
i
can
find
that
commissioner
lee
is
not
to
be
put
under
an
injunction.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
and
i
think
the
court
just
put
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i'm
--
i
think
it's
a
declaratory
judgment
of
course
to
begin
with.
i
think
it's
an
explicitly
stated
declaratory
judgment
with
an
order.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
an
order
for
him
to
segregate,
yes,
i
think
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it
orders
him
to
file
in
courts,
and
if
they
did
not
desegregated
or
if
a
city
jail
or
city
prison
did
not
file
reports
with
mr.
lee,
i
think
we
go
back
in
the
court
to
seek
more
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
think
we
go
back
to
place
him
under
an
injunction
first.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
might,
i
haven't
gone
that
far
yet,
but
i
might
try
to
but
i
think
that
probably
have
to
go
back
to
injunction.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
--
i
think
that's
exactly.
and
i
think
courts
are
of
course
worried
about
exercise
the
discretion
of
the
prison
officials.
i
think
all
the
courts
are
and
i
think
this
court
felt
that
this
was
the
proper
way
to
first
write
down
a
statute.
number
two;
order
the
erasure
of
the
vestiges
of
the
statutes
and
then
move
forward
affirmatively
to
eliminate
the
segregation
which
is
vested
under
louisiana
versus
united
states.
i
think
it
was
an
admirable
exercise
of
traditional
discretion.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
of
course
arises
from
the
district
court
in
the
middle
district
of
alabama.
i
know
of
no
case
where
the
district
court
has
exercised
its
discretion
more
soundly
and
has
relied
more
upon
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
before
it,
who
were
the
defendants
in
the
case.
in
fact,
the
defendants
in
this
case
wrote
their
own
order.
the
district
court
participated
in
questioning
at
some
length
to
a
great
extent
of
the
witnesses
in
the
case
bu
both
judge
reeves
and
judge
johnson.
the
witnesses
in
the
case
responded
that
there
would
be
no
problem.
as
a
matter
of
fact
robert
austin
testified
in
birmingham,
he
said
that
the
warden
of
the
birmingham
jail
said,
his
only
problem
with
the
drunk
tank.
it
was
only
his
word,
the
court
gave
him
the
drunk
tank.
the
court
went
down
the
line
and
established
a
pattern
and
a
time
table
for
desegregation.
they
answered
if
they're
not
be
placed
under
injunction
the
court
issued
no
injunction.
the
court
simply
issued
an
order
and
sent
to
the
commissioner
of
correction.
it
said,
would
you
please
report
to
the
court
every
three
months
and
tell
us
what
progress
you're
making.
of
course,
the
commissioner
of
correction's
can
do
this,
in
all
towns
of
over
10,000
but
he
cannot
do
it
in
towns
of
other
10,000,
he
says,
unless
ordered
by
the
government.
the
government
of
alabama
appoints
the
board
of
corrections.
mr.
lee
is
the
responsible
state
official,
responsible
for
administering
state
law
that
over
100
years
have
discriminated
these
negroes.
and
what
this
case
is,
is
simply
one
more
case
in
a
long
series
of
cases
to
abolish
a
dual
system
of
justice
in
the
south
and
to
a
degree
in
the
nation.
this
is
the
end
of
the
system
of
justice.
for
those
who
live
instead
of
die
in
alabama
be
segregated
instrumentality
of
justice
which
is
of
electric
chair.
prior
to
this
time,
negroes
to
a
greater
and
greater
degree
are
becoming
able
to
participate
in
a
color
blind

of

and

house.
that
day
has
not
yet
come.
now,
may
i
refer
the
court
to
page
183
and
184
of
the
record?
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i'm
--
that's
exactly
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
now
from
the
record
itself.
page
183
and
184,
judge
reeves
said,
who
would
look
–
who
would
we
look
to
for
reports
from
the
county
in
city
jails?
could
your
department
make
these
reports?
this
is
to
commissioner
lee.
witness:
yes,
sir.
judge
reeves:
who
would
we
--
then
he
goes
on.
this
is
some
of
the
planning
that
we
have
been
doing
in
anticipation
of
something
like
this.
i
see,
says
judge
reeves.
witness:
we
can
do
that
sir.
now,
we
can
move
over
now
in
the
record
to
page
1
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
--
what
is
say
is
judge
reeves
and
judge
johnson
in
recognition
of
the
discretion
that
must
be
vested
in
prison
officials.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
have
–
yes,
has
relied
upon
their
discretion.
they
exercise
the
discretion,
the
suggestion
that
they
made
to
the
court,
more
explicitly
on
page
166
to
160
of
the
record.
question:
judge
reeves,
mr.
madison
will
you
bring
out
from
mr.
lee
to
what
extent
his
conduct
this
commissioner
brief
is
influenced
by
statutes
waiting
segregation
of
prevalence.
and
followed
down
there
and
a
question
comes
up
and
he
says,
in
that
event,
how
long
in
your
judgment
would
you
need
to
follow
the
direction
of
the
court
in
that
respect?
answer:
this
would
be
most
difficult
for
me
to
answer
but
i
would.
we
--
we
might
do
it
a
month.
we
might
do
it
in
two
months.
it
could,
it
might
take
a
year.
it
all
depends
on
when.
i
don't
know
just
how
this
will
be
received.
i
will
be
quite
frankly,
you
got
some
who
will
like,
some
will
dislike.
we
would
make
every
effort
to
make
it
--
make
it
function,
but
i
would
hate
to
think
that
we
--
we
would
have
to
do
it
for
less
than
a
years
time
even
though
if
we
would
get
such
an
order
where
we
would
start
tomorrow.
they
asked
for
a
year
and
the
court
gave
them
a
year
as
far
as
its
maximum
security
institution
was
concerned.
the
court
gave
six
months
as
far
as
minimum
and
medium
security
institutions
were
concerned.
the
court
said,
in
your
honor
forms
and
honor
camps
and
your
educational
institutions
immediate
desegregation.
the
court
said
for
the
county
jails
and
the
party
who
were
sued
as
representative
of
the
class
of
sheriffs,
eldon
bailey
is
not
the
appellant
in
this
case.
these
are
67
county
jails.
commissioner
lee
has
no
jail
and
his
county
had
seven
county
jails.
there
are
some
as
we
say
one
room
calabooses
in
--
in
some
of
these
towns.
we
don't
know
the
number
because
we've
attempt
ascertain
that
for
purpose
of
argument.
we
have
some
figures
but
i
doubt
if
they
are
accurate.
but
what's
happened
here
is
in
the
country
jails?
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
mr.
bailey
had
a
month
consider
the
--
rather
six
months
as
to
the
other
county
sheriffs.
and
the
jobs
in
county
jail,
we'll
turn
to
page
196
of
the
record,
you'll
find
judge
reeves
asking
a
question
of
the
following
questions.
mr.
austin,
the
warden
of
the
birmingham
city
jail,
he
says,
mr.
austin,
as
i
understand
your
whole
chief
concerned
about
integrating
is
this
to
your
drunk
tank.
witness:
yes,
sir,
definitely
sir.
judge
reeves:
and
you,
you
don't
have
much
problem
except
as
to
that?
witness:
any
foreseeable
problem,
i
think
i
could
work
the
other
out
at
a
given
time.
now,
the
posed
problem
is
a
problem
of
riots
in
prisons.
we've
had
far
fewer
riots
in
prisons
than
we've
had
out
of
prisons.
one
of
the
reasons
perhaps
that
we
do
have
riots
maybe
the
negroes
do
not
feel
that
they
can
take
their
struggle
out
to
the
streets
and
into
the
courts.
and
one
of
the
reasons
that's
wrong
predicament
is
because
that
court
house
in
the
deep
south
is
always
represented
to
them
and
an
instrumentality
of
regression.
all
we're
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
affirm
the
lower
court
decision
and
this
is
the
lower
court,
the
middle
district
of
alabama
about
which
this
court
said
in
reynolds
versus
sims
that
they
had
exercised
an
appropriate
well-considered
exercise
of
judicial
power.
this
court
has
been
as
flexible
as
any
court
has
been.
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
the
wardens
of
these
jails
come
back
to
the
court
and
they
say
we
have
this
particular
problem,
the
court
would
say,
fine,
we'll
work
it
out.
commissioner
lee
had
done
it
so.
this
case
was
tried
in
1966,
and
some
of
the
problems
that
didn't
exist
in
the
record
in
1966
when
the
record
was
made
apparently
exist
now.
i
don't
know
where
they
come
from.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
it
has.
application
for
the
state
of
the
district
of
court
was
made.
the
district
court
gave
20
days
in
order
for
this
court
to
grant
stay
with
this
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
sir.
not
to
my
knowledge.
it
has
not
gone
into
the
effect
if
didn't
strike
court
jury.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge
but
i
could
represent
either
way
on
that
your
honor.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
you
did.
you
state
–
the
district
court
denied
the
state
in
giving
20
days,
mr.
justice
black
referred
to
the
full
court
as
i
recall
it.
the
court
stayed
that
and
again
except
that
fourth
petition
here.
i
want
to
point
out
this,
when
you
talked
about
conditions
in
jail
and
it
represented
the
state
so
too.
i
have
no
doubt
that
what
was
stated
in
--
in
brown
v.
board
about
separate
being
inherently
only
applies
to
a
consummately
greater
degree
in
a
prison
system.
in
a
prison
system
there
may
well
be
packed
and
overcrowded
than
it's
high
time
in
the
state
of
alabama
provided
a
--
provided
a
prison
system
that
is
not
over
packed
and
overcrowded
and
provided
one
that
is
fair
and
equal
across
the
board.
well
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
--
i
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
made
a
little
study
of
that
as
best
we
could.
it's
sort
of
a
telephone
survey
over
a
couple
of
places
there
and
one
of
them
was
walker
county
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
walker
county,
yes.
in
walker
county,
you
don't
have
a
municipal
jail
as
i
understand
they
have
over
two
rooms,
most
of
them
with
one
room.
the
--
most
of
the
prisoners
of
course
go
to
the
county
jail
in
jasper.
you
have
municipal
jails
of
walker
county
in
carbon
hill,
cordova,
dora,
nauvoo,
oakland,
parish
and
simpson.
each
of
those
jails
almost
all
of
those
towns,
they
have
one
room.
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
segregate
when
you
have
only
one
cell.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
they
are
the
ones
they
call
calabooses,
yes,
sir.
i
i
want
to
make
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
he
could
put
this
way
but
i
record
to
those
–
in
those
small
town
but
i
guess
they
just
haven't
had
a
negro
and
white
man
dropped
on
the
same
time,
but
that
i
don't
know.[laughter]
we
--
we
make
no
contention
here
if
the
prison
officials
should
be
in
that
discretion
to
protect
prisoners.
as
dr.
king
went
back
to
the
[inaudible]
jail
with
which
mr.
justice
black
is
probably
more
familiar
with
many
men
at
least
historically.
there's
no
question
in
my
mind,
there
are
certain
kinds
of
prisoners
that
you
wouldn't
want
dr.
king
to
be
confined
with
and
there's
not
a
thing
in
this
decree
of
this
court
that
prevents
the
exercise
of
responsible
discretion
by
responsible
officials
in
a
nondiscriminatory
manner.
i
want
to
point
out
the
same
discretion
that
prison
officials
want
today
was
the
discretion
denied
to
them
by
law
and
made
a
misdemeanor
for
almost
a
hundred
years.
we
ask
this
court
to
strike
down
self-fulfilling
prophecy.
we
ask
this
court
to
strike
down
racial
discrimination
in
the
prisons
of
the
united
states
and
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
below.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
so
the
principle
difference
we
have
i
think
is
this
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
not
really
because
i
think
my
--
the
opposition
adapts
a
position
and
since
the
opposition
used
the
word
i
think
just
playing
common
sense
judge.
now,
the
plain
common
sense
judgment
says
this
case
could
not
arise
[inaudible]
out
of
alabama.
the
prison
commissioner
is
appointed
by
the
governor
of
alabama.
the
governor
of
alabama
has
stood
in
school
house
doors
but
not
yet
jail
house
doors.
and
the
fact
remains
that
i
don't
believe
that
a
man
in
alabama
in
public
office
subject
to
appointees
of
the
government,
can
in
fact
exercise
his
discretion
and
his
duty
without
an
order
of
the
court.
i
think
we
get
to
that
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
oh,
yes,
if
--
if
the
order
stated
that.
i
--
i
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
it's
rather
conceivable
that
it
does
but
we
referred
--
very
open
to
me
and
this
district
court
is
you
know
it's
in
the
same
city
with
commissioner
lee.
they're
not
far
away.
they
know
the
condition
and
the
circumstances
there,
it's
totally
reasonable
court.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
in
the
record
i
think
i
can
find
that
commissioner
lee
is
not
to
be
put
under
an
injunction.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
and
i
think
the
court
just
put
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i'm
--
i
think
it's
a
declaratory
judgment
of
course
to
begin
with.
i
think
it's
an
explicitly
stated
declaratory
judgment
with
an
order.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
an
order
for
him
to
segregate,
yes,
i
think
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it
orders
him
to
file
in
courts,
and
if
they
did
not
desegregated
or
if
a
city
jail
or
city
prison
did
not
file
reports
with
mr.
lee,
i
think
we
go
back
in
the
court
to
seek
more
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
think
we
go
back
to
place
him
under
an
injunction
first.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
might,
i
haven't
gone
that
far
yet,
but
i
might
try
to
but
i
think
that
probably
have
to
go
back
to
injunction.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
--
i
think
that's
exactly.
and
i
think
courts
are
of
course
worried
about
exercise
the
discretion
of
the
prison
officials.
i
think
all
the
courts
are
and
i
think
this
court
felt
that
this
was
the
proper
way
to
first
write
down
a
statute.
number
two;
order
the
erasure
of
the
vestiges
of
the
statutes
and
then
move
forward
affirmatively
to
eliminate
the
segregation
which
is
vested
under
louisiana
versus
united
states.
i
think
it
was
an
admirable
exercise
of
traditional
discretion.
