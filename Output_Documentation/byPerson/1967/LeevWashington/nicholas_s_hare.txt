mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
to
you
on
direct
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
and
it
involves
alleged
racial
discrimination
in
prisons.
the
plaintiffs
below
brought
this
action
alleging
racial
discrimination
in
the
alabama
prisons
and
state
prisons
in
the
alabama
jails.
and
they
alleged
that
the
statutes
requiring
separation
of
the
races
were
unconstitutional.
now,
i
do
not
concede
that
those
statutes
are
unconstitutional,
but
my
argument
before
you
gentlemen
today
is
to
show
that
even
if
you
hold
those
statutes
as
unconstitutional,
the
case
requires
modification,
the
decree
should
be
modified.
it's
too
rigid.
it
destroys
unnecessarily
reasonable
administrative
discretion.
now,
the
courts
traditionally
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
no,
sir.
i
make
no
contentions
to
that,
but
i'm
not
in
a
position
to
concede
that
that
they
are
unconstitutional.
i
take
the
position
that
if
you
gentlemen
do
declare
them
unconstitutional,
the
case
should
be
revised
or
that
portion
of
the
case
should
be
reversed
which
destroys
reasonable
discretion
on
the
part
of
prison
officials.
and
of
course,
this
case
is
one
of
overriding
importance,
much
more
important
than
just
the
state
of
alabama.
this
is
–
this
was
set
the
pattern
for
prison
administration
throughout
the
country.
now,
there
are
two
aspects
of
this
appeal.
one
is
procedural
and
i'll
try
to
dispose
of
that
first.
the
appellant
frank
lee
is
the
commissioner
of
the
state
prisons.
the
appellant,
robert
austin
is
warden
of
the
city
jail
of
birmingham.
now,
this
was
begun
in
handle
as
the
class
action
as
to
all
of
the
jails
in
the
state,
and
all
of
the
jailers
and
the
appellees
when
they
brought
this
case,
they
alleged
that
austin
as
the
warden
of
the
city
jail
was
a
representative
of
that
class
of
jailers
and
we
say
that
that
is
not
correct,
that
cannot
be
correct.
that
a
class
action
the
necessary
elements
for
class
action
are
missing.
alabama
is
a
rural
state.
we've
got
67
counties
and
many
small
communities
that
have
their
jails,
some
of
them
just
have
one
cell
caboose.
this
--
this
order
which
is
directed
towards
af
–
afro
appellant,
austin,
seeks
to
bind
without
these
people
ever
been
in
the
court
at
all
with
ever
--
without
having
any
opportunity
to
show
that
peculiar
and
unusual
circumstances
in
that
particular
jails,
tries
to
bind
all
of
the
jailers
in
alabama.
we
say
that
this
is
not
truly
a
representative
class.
that
the
defendant
there
could
not
represent
all
of
the
others
and
did
not,
and
they
were
not
before
the
court
and
this
order
should
not
be
binding
on
them.
they
ought
to
have
that
day
in
court.
it's
just
elemental
justice.
it's
--
is
that
due
process.
well,
so
much
for
that
aspect
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
yes,
sir.
the
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
now,
here
are
the
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
no,
sir.
the
record
doesn't
show
that
they
are
the
same.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
well,
the
city
of
birmingham
is
a
metropolitan
city.
it's
the
biggest
city
in
the
state.
it's
all
between
three
and
four
hundred
thousand
and
it's
got
a
modern,
up
to
date
jail
and
it's
a
prison,
practically
a
prison.
it's
like
a
well-run
prison.
whereas
our
rural
jails
just
one
man
--
just
one
man
operated
and
frequently
not
anybody
there
at
all.
frequently,
there
is
no
jailer
around.
if
there
is
any
--
should
be
any
trouble
or
any
strike
that
would
break
out
racial
or
otherwise
it
--
they
have
to
anticipate
it
as
best
they
can
and
separate
the
prisons
as
the
judgment
requires
as
best
as
they
can.
now,
that's
true
though
of
the
entire
system,
but
what
i'm
--
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
the
rural
communities,
their
problems
are
not
just
saying
as
the
problems
in
the
well-run,
well-organized,
well-financed
birmingham
city
jail.
so,
i
don't
want
to
take
too
much
time
on
that
procedural
aspect
because
the
heart
of
this
matter
is
the
merits,
not
that
just
procedural
problem.
now,
there
is
one
other
procedural
problem
and
i'll
raise
these
though
primarily
because
there's
been
no
intervening
hearing
of
this
between
the
trial
court
and
you
gentlemen
because
it
came
on
direct
appeal.
now,
it
had
just
been
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
is
another
appellate
court,
that
issue
would
have
been
resolved
there
and
we
could
just
get
to
the
merits.
but
there
is
one
further
procedural
thing
that
i
want
to
point
out
and
that
is
commissioner
frank
lee,
the
head
of
the
state
prison
system,
under
the
court's
order
is
required
to
supervise
not
only
his
prisoners,
but
the
jails
of
alabama,
supervise
the
desegregation.
now
he
has
been
given
responsibility
while
he
has
no
authority.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
only
on
those
jails
in
cities
above
10,000
and
most
of
our
--
well,
i
wouldn't
say
most
of
our
jails,
yes,
i
guess
most
of
our
jails
though
in
cities
under
10,000
a
great
number
are
anyway.
so,
we
seek
to
have
the
commissioner
of
prisons
relieved
from
that
part
of
the
order
which
requires
him
to
supervise
something
that
he's
got
no
authority,
they
just
ignore
it.
now,
the
importance
of
that
though
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
i
concede
that
he
can
supervise
those
or
that
he
can
make
reports
as
to
those
above
10,000,
yes,
sir.
but
i
do
not
concede
that
he
should
because
i
think
as
we
get
to
that
both
to
the
merits.
now,
when
we
get
to
the
merits
we
would
see
that
but
the
two
points
i
want
to
make
of
procedural
–
procedure,
are
these.
number
one,
the
warden
of
the
city
jail
of
birmingham
is
not
representative
sufficiently
of
that
class
for
you
--
for
that
court
to
make
an
injunction
so
to
speak,
where
that
you
could
move
directly
against
these
other
jailers
without
giving
them
their
day
in
court
just
doing
the
ordinary
due
process.
that's
the
first
point
of
procedure.
the
second
part
of
procedure
is
we
seek
to
have
commissioner
lee,
who
is
the
appellant
in
this
case;
we
seek
to
have
him
relieved
from
this
responsibility
of
seeing
that
all
the
jails
are
desegregated
and
we
seek
to
have
him
relieved
of
the
responsibility
of
making
90-day
reports
periodic.
now,
there
are
two
aspects
of
the
merits.
one
relates
to
the
statutes.
the
alabama
statutes
like
many
other
southern
states
require
racial
separation
of
prisoners,
just
blank
it
arbitrarily
racial
segregation
in
prison.
now
that
may
or
may
not
be
constitutional,
i
make
no
point
of
it.
i'll
say
this
that
the
point
is
if
you
void
those
statutes
then
alabama
--
the
alabama
prison
systems
and
alabama
jails
are
like
those
of
all
the
other
states
and
like
the
federal
prisons.
they
are
--
that
they
are
not
hobbled,
the
prison
officials
are
not
hobbled
by
any
arbitrary
requirement
of
separations
but
now
here
is
the
real
problem,
the
second
aspect
of
this
case.
the
court
in
its
effort
to
ensure
desegregation
went
too
far.
they
destroyed
reasonable,
sensible,
common
sense
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
prison
officials.
now,
traditionally
the
courts
have
never
interfered
with
reasonable
prison
management.
that's
just
very,
very
sensitive
area.
you're
not
talking
about
school
children
now.
you're
talking
about
the
most
violent,
the
most
vicious
element
of
our
society,
the
most
dangerous.
many
of
them
are
wanton
killers.
many
of
them
are
troublemakers.
many
of
them
are
just
looking
for
fight
and
trouble.
and
then
--
and
most
of
them
are
extremely
excitable
in
emotional.
now,
the
weight
of
my
argument
to
you
gentlemen
is
this,
not
all
is
common
sense.
you
must
at
least
imagine
and
argue.
you
must
leave
reasonable
discretion
to
the
prison
officials
because
we
are
talking
about
the
safety
of
the
prisoners
themselves,
the
safety
of
the
prison
officials
and
the
integrity
of
the
system.
we're
talking
about
it
--
we
--
all
of
us
want
the
prisons
run
humanely.
now,
when
i
--
when
i
make
this
argument
please
don't
think
that
i
am
urging
that
the
court
cannot
take
a
case
of
racial
discrimination,
invidious
racial
discrimination.
of
course,
that's
justiciable
issue.
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
is,
this
court
must
revise
the
lower
court's
opinion
so
that
it
is
in
line
with
the
great
body
of
law
which
allows
reasonable,
sensible,
discretion
in
prison
officials.
we
separate
that
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
no,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
oh,
no,
sir.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
to
the
contrary
the
record
shows
that
the
prison
--
the
chief
prison
official
stated
that
he
would
make
every
attempt
to
comply
with
whatever
order
was
decided.
and
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
oh!
we
see
that
he
can't,
but
if
you
will
make
a
clear
determination
of
the
law,
a
clear
statement
of
the
law,
we
say
that
that's
enough
because
then
each
instance
of
invidious
racial
discrimination
after
that
will
have
an
opportunity
for
fair
review
and
--
and
the
case
can
be
handled
by
itself
and
that
you
will
not
be
taking
a
precipitous
step
which
will
destroy
the
prison
security.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
yes,
sir.
i
think
there
can
be.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
that
can
be.
now,
i'll
show
you
why.
racial
now
this
--
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned,
for
the
statutes
there
can
be
no
such
–
just
you
recently
decided
this
miscegenation
case
that
the
one
last
cases
i
think
that
you
all
decided.
there
are
some
--
there
is
no
such
thing
as
statutory
distinction
as
to
race.
the
only
thing
i'm
saying
is
if
you
get
a
20
black
muslims
and
20
violent
ku
klux
klan
members
in
the
same
cell,
you're
going
to
have
problems.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
you
need
[attempt
to
laughter]
a
large
cell
with
a
lot
--
a
lot
of
room.
and
along
that
point,
there's
as
many
as
50
--
ours
prison
system
is
so
crowded
right
now,
there
are
as
many
as
15
prisoners
herded
together
at
night
in
one
cell,
many
as
--
many
as
a
150
in
one
barracks.
now,
we
ask
for
time
as
much
as
anything
else.
we
have
let
the
contract
where
our
prison
system
is
being
modified
or
being
stricken.
the
old
one
is
the
old
prison,
the
main
prison
being
destroyed
and
we
are
--
in
july
1969,
we
will
have
a
completely
new
prison
system
which
would
--
which
there's
no
distinction.
there's
no
--
there's
no
distinction
in
areas
or
parts
whether
different
prisoners
will
be
--
they've
already
done
as
much
as
they
can
towards
making
it
fair
for
individuals
whether
it'd
be
white
or
black.
it
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
make
bit
different
job
presentations.
what
we
say
is
just
the
same
as
the
courts
have
repeated
like
hell.
now,
i
circulated
to
you
gentlemen
a
case
which
was
just
decided
and
it
came
to
my
attention
after
the
brief
was
printed,
and
i've
given
opposing
in
counsel
copies.
it
appeared
in
36
law
week
on
page
2235
and
the
case
is
toles
(ph)
versus
katzenbach,
a
federal
prisoner
and
it's
very,
very
important,
toles
(ph)
versus
katzenbach,
and
it
was
decided
in
the
ninth
circuit,
september
27th.
i'll
read
the
head
note
in
the
law,
this
law
week.
federal
prison
officials
acquiescence
in
white
prisoners'
desire
to
exclude
negro
from
all
white
cell.
this
perpetuating
previous
policy
of
racial
segregated
cells
is
not
forbidden
by
the
constitution.
and
the
first
paragraph
reads
this
way,
“the
practice
is
founded
on
interest
of
harmony,
security
and
the
compatibility
of
prisoners
confined
for
long
terms,
all
matters
of
vital
concern
in
prison
operation.
the
practice
in
our
judgment
is
a
reasonable
means
of
furthering
these
interests.
under
this
practice
the
fact
that
the
interests
are
directly
involved
in
a
particular
case
is
not
left
to
assumption
based
upon
experienced
gained
in
other
cases,
but
it's
assured
by
inquiry
in
each
individual
case.
”
now
there
was
a
decision
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
no,
sir.
because
they're
not
quite
the
same,
the
reasoning
though
is
the
same.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
because
--
now
here
--
now
this
--
read
the
one
paragraph
in
the
dissent
that
was
a
dissent,
but
he
did
not
--
this
judge
did
not
dissent
on
the
merits
but
dissented
the
--
because
the
case
was
summarily
handled
and
he
said
that,
“they
should
have
had
a
full
hearing.
”the
majority
quite
properly
states,
the
question
“is
not
whether
segregation
results,
but
whether
there's
an
acceptable
reason
for
the
practice.
”
now,
that
--
that's
what
i'm
saying
is
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
oh
the
statute,
sir?
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
you're
100%
right.
i
know
–
there's
no
question.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
the
statute
is
about
100
years
old.
the
statute
is
about
100
years
old
and
i
have
very
little
doubt
but
that
if
the
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
no,
sir,
[attempt
to
laughter]
they
didn't.
the
statute
is
very
old
and
i
have
very
little
doubt,
but
that
it
will
be
that
part
of
the
lower
court's
decision
will
be
affirmed.
but
i
urge
the
court
to
revise
that
part
of
the
lower
court's
opinion
which
is
just
an
arbitrary
as
that
legislative
pronouncement.
it
says
that
there
shall
be
immediate
and
total.
well,
i
don't
mean
to
use
the
word
immediate.
they
gave
us
six
months
in
certain
fields
and
one
year
in
the
other,
but
the
effect
of
it
is
total
desegregation.
now,
all
that
we
say
is
please
rewrite
that
aspect
of
the
decree
in
line
with
the
--
the
general
body
of
law
which
commits
reasonable,
reasonable
discretion
and
we
separate
prisoners
now
by
age.
we
separate
them
by
sex.
we
separate
them
by
violence,
tendency,
tendency
to
violence,
the
nature
of
the
crimes,
and
there
will
be
occasions
when
we'll
have
to
separate
them
by
race.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
yes,
sir.
they
did
take
affirmed.
practically
every
--
practically
everybody
now,
the
--
they
–
for
it's
physically
possible,
there
is
no
distinction
told
and
everybody
eats
together,
find
a
place
together,
there
are
exercise
period
that
sort
of
thing.
there's
no
--
there's
no
--
there's
really
no
distinction
made
between
the
white
and
the
black
except
that
in
most
areas
still
because
of
the
state
which
permitted
it,
most
area
still
in
the
smaller
places
they
house
them
separately,
if
they
want
to
be
housed
separately.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
now
--
they
–
but
if
you
read
the
rest
of
it,
they
just
limit
to
what
we
call
the
drunk
tank
in
the
birmingham
jail.
now,
if
–-
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
we
think
it
ought
to
be
--
we
think
it
should
be
spelled
out
a
little
bit
more
positively
by
the
court.
now,
we
think
this
that
the
court
can
achieve
what
it
is
after
by
a
strong
statement
of
the
law.
then
with
an
explanation
similar
to
this,
now
i
found
this
wording
yesterday
in
a
–
and
it's
not
in
the
brief,
it's
--
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
in
the
other
side
because
i
would
–
i
--
it's
just
my
argument,
really.
it's
a
federal
supp
263
page
630
particularly
page
631
and
its
ray
versus
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
now
that
was
a
voting
case,
but
it
--
the
law
is
what
--
the
principle
of
what
i'm
arguing.
lawful
incarceration
brings
about
the
necessary
withdrawal
or
limitation
of
many
privileges
and
rights.
a
withdrawal
which
is
justified
by
the
consideration
underlying
our
penal
system.
to
argue
that
incarcerated
--
that
the
incarcerated
person
can
only
be
incarcerated
and
not
be
deprived
of
the
average
person's
ordinary
rights
as
he
would
have
them
if
the
prisoner
was
not
convicted
and
sentenced
and
confined
is
a
matter
of
ordinary
common
logic
absurd.
it
is
only
where
fundamental
humane
and
necessary
rights
are
breached
that
the
constitutional
protections
become
involved.
now
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
that's
263
federal
supplement
630.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
it
is
ray
versus
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
nicholas

hare
yes,
sir.
now
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
there
are
--
we
don't
have
any
longer
--
mr.
nicholas

--
under
our
new
system.
under
our
new
prison
system
they
won't
be

mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
yes,
sir.
there
has
been.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
that's
right.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
i
think
--
and
i
don't
think
that
never
--
i've
never
heard
that
race
before,
never
thought
of
it.
i
don't
(voice

--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
yes,
it
is.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
no,
sir.
but
really
all
that
we
seek
to
maintain,
if
all
the
prison
officials
in
alabama
and
throughout
the
nation
the
reasonable
discretion
to
run
that
prisons
for
the
safety
of
the
inmates,
safety
of
the
officials,
and
protection
of
the
public,
that
really
holds
it
and
i
--
and
i
say
that
each
one
--
each
situation
must
be
viewed
in
it's
own
light
at
the
time
and
if
there's
any
invidious
racial
discrimination
that
should
be
corrected
and
can
be
corrected.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
it
is
--
that
is
--
you
can
read
that
in
to
the
case,
but
the
order,
the
order
itself
requires
that
more
is
an
opinion
but
the
order
require
total
desegregation.
now,
if
that
--
if
at
the
end
of
that
it
had
said,
except
in
such
instances
where
in
the
reasonable
discretion
of
the
--
of
the
prison
officials
the
safety
of
the
prisoner
and
the
prison
officials
is
impaired
or
in
danger.
they
would
have
the
authority.
we
--
what
we
really
up
to
is
modifying
that
part
of
the
case,
modifying
that
part
of
the
order
so
that
it'd
be,
everybody
will
understand
that
they
do
have
reasonable
discretion,
but
that
is
all
they
have.
they
do
not
have
any
arbitrary
right
to
separate
this.
the
stat
--
if
the
statute
is
gone
then
alabama
would
be
just
like
--
like
the
federal
prisons.
mr.
nicholas

your
honor,
if
you
--
if
you

you'll
find
it
in
the
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
it's
132
of
the
record.
yes,
that
in
the
last
paragraph.
it
is
further
ordered
that

commissioner
of

board
of

for

his
successors

and

mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
that
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
that
we
feel
that
that
would
unnecessarily
robs
prison
officials
of
their
right
to
separate
when
race
is
involved
just
like
they
have
the
right
to
do
to
separate
as
to
sex,
age,
and
that
sort
of
thing
whenever
in
that
judgment
it
is
necessary
to
call
the
prison
security.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
yes.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
right.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
that's
correct.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
that
is
correct.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
no
sir,
i
wouldn't
think
that
would
be
necessary
to
go
that
far.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
no,
sir.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
i
couldn't
in
–
on
a
state
request
that
they
go
that
far.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
without
conceding
the
unconstitutionally
statute
of
the
criticizing
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
i
would
say
that
that
part
of
the
order
should
be
or
could
be
conceivably
affirmed.
the
rest
of
the
decision
should
be
reversed
and
rewritten
by
this
court,
so
that
there's
a
strong
and
clear
pronouncement
of
what
the
law
of
the
nation
is
about
the
separation
of
the
races
merely
hold
that
purpose.
but
leave
it
with
sufficient
discretion
so
that
you
do
not
handcuff
prison
officials,
jailers,
all
of
the
country.
but
if
they
don't
do
what
the
law
--
what
as
you
pronounce
it,
if
they
don't
follow
that
law,
that
rule,
well
then
each
one
of
those
cases
can
be
immediately
taken
care
off.
you
can
see
that
our
district
courts
in
alabama
have
certainly
have
forced
the
law
as
you
pronounced
it.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
in
a
strong
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
that
would
--
no
order
like
this.
yes
sir.
no
order
like
this.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
well,
we
would
prefer
to
be
relieved
from
that
and
let
--
if
--
then
any
if
they
do
practice
any
discrimination,
it
can
be
stopped.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
that's
right.
because
the
condition
is
maybe
different.
mr.
nicholas

hare
well

mr.
nicholas

except
in
order
of
(voice

mr.
nicholas

hare
except

except
in
their
order
they
go
so
much
further
than
that
and
we
feel
too
that
we've
got
here
more
time
because
our
--
our
prison
facilities
are
not
adequate
for
this,
but
we
have
let
the
contracts
and
the
new
plans
for
the
prisons
make
no
--
no
distinction
as
to
race
whatsoever.
it
--
it
--they're
completely
in
a
agreed
prisons.
mr.
nicholas

1969.
mr.
nicholas

and
it
all
--
yes
sir,
except
in
the
--
mr.
nicholas

because
we
feel
that
the

that
the
order

that
the
order

mr.

i
beg
you
sir?
mr.
nicholas

hare
one
year
from
december
1966.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
quite
frankly,
we've
never
--
we've
never
considered
that
and
if
we
don't
get
relief
here
we'll
have
to
but
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
well,
that
is
--
that
is
the
program.
yes,
sir.
all
we
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
no,
sir.
except
that
we
feel
that
from
the
tenure
of
the
--
of
the
order
itself
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
yes,
sir.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
oh,
i
don't
think
of
that
but
we
have
the
right
to
go
back
to
that.
but
i
think
that
it's
very
clear
that
this
particular
order
needs
some
modification
so
that
those
judges
will
see
that
reasonable
discretion
must
be
left
and
i
think
more
emphasis
needs
to
be
made
in
that
except
in
unusual
circumstances
because
that's
not
carried
over
to
that
order.
that's
just
a
part
of
the
opinion.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
it
would
be
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
–
really
all
we
want
is
that
we
want
the
administrative
officials
in
charge
of
jails
or
prisons
when
they
are
of
the
opinion
that
separation
at
a
time
will
aid
and
maintain
discipline
in
prison
security
that
they're
not
violating
any
judicial
order.
then,
we
can't
wait
until
a
trouble
happens
or
you
can't
--
the
prison
officials
must
the
best
as
he
can
–
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
it
happened
in
california.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
yes,
sir.
it
happened
in
california.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
yes,
sir.
if
he's
one
the
--
if
this
is
not
explained
he
might
really
take
the
chance
then
killing
one
another
and
him
getting
in
trouble
with
the
judge.
he'd
be
in
no
trouble
then,
but
that
certainly
is
not
a
humane
thing.
i
do
want
to
point
out
one
thing
in
the
--
my
reply
brief,
i
have
cited
a
number
of
illustrations
of
just
newspaper
articles
that
have
common
knowledge
so
that
the
court
will
have
before
it
the
recollection
of
how
violent
these
people
are
and
the
prison
officials
must
anticipate
these
things
and
stop
them
before
they
occur.
that's
really
--
that's
really
what
is
the
focus
of
my
argument.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
justice
stewart
asked
the
question
i
found
the
answer.
with
reference
to
class
representation
of
the
defendant,
the
warden
of
the
birmingham
city
jail
on
page
179,
the
testimony
is,
“in
your
opinion
would
you
say
in
your
opinion
there's
a
substantial
difference
between
the
smaller
town
jails
in
alabama
and
the
city
jails
and
the
birmingham
city
jail
in
facility
supervision
and
the
type
of
control
between
these?
”
answer:
yes,
sir.
so,
i
say
that
the
record
itself
shows
that
there's
not
a
proper
class
action.
and
i
just
want
to
--
want
to
in
passing
just
remember
–
remind
of
the
court
of
the
tragedy
in
florida
when
37
prisoners
burned
to
death
this
last
july
that
it
followed
the
fight
between
colored
men
and
white
men.
it
just
seems
that
–-
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
to
you
on
direct
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
and
it
involves
alleged
racial
discrimination
in
prisons.
the
plaintiffs
below
brought
this
action
alleging
racial
discrimination
in
the
alabama
prisons
and
state
prisons
in
the
alabama
jails.
and
they
alleged
that
the
statutes
requiring
separation
of
the
races
were
unconstitutional.
now,
i
do
not
concede
that
those
statutes
are
unconstitutional,
but
my
argument
before
you
gentlemen
today
is
to
show
that
even
if
you
hold
those
statutes
as
unconstitutional,
the
case
requires
modification,
the
decree
should
be
modified.
it's
too
rigid.
it
destroys
unnecessarily
reasonable
administrative
discretion.
now,
the
courts
traditionally
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
no,
sir.
i
make
no
contentions
to
that,
but
i'm
not
in
a
position
to
concede
that
that
they
are
unconstitutional.
i
take
the
position
that
if
you
gentlemen
do
declare
them
unconstitutional,
the
case
should
be
revised
or
that
portion
of
the
case
should
be
reversed
which
destroys
reasonable
discretion
on
the
part
of
prison
officials.
and
of
course,
this
case
is
one
of
overriding
importance,
much
more
important
than
just
the
state
of
alabama.
this
is
–
this
was
set
the
pattern
for
prison
administration
throughout
the
country.
now,
there
are
two
aspects
of
this
appeal.
one
is
procedural
and
i'll
try
to
dispose
of
that
first.
the
appellant
frank
lee
is
the
commissioner
of
the
state
prisons.
the
appellant,
robert
austin
is
warden
of
the
city
jail
of
birmingham.
now,
this
was
begun
in
handle
as
the
class
action
as
to
all
of
the
jails
in
the
state,
and
all
of
the
jailers
and
the
appellees
when
they
brought
this
case,
they
alleged
that
austin
as
the
warden
of
the
city
jail
was
a
representative
of
that
class
of
jailers
and
we
say
that
that
is
not
correct,
that
cannot
be
correct.
that
a
class
action
the
necessary
elements
for
class
action
are
missing.
alabama
is
a
rural
state.
we've
got
67
counties
and
many
small
communities
that
have
their
jails,
some
of
them
just
have
one
cell
caboose.
this
--
this
order
which
is
directed
towards
af
–
afro
appellant,
austin,
seeks
to
bind
without
these
people
ever
been
in
the
court
at
all
with
ever
--
without
having
any
opportunity
to
show
that
peculiar
and
unusual
circumstances
in
that
particular
jails,
tries
to
bind
all
of
the
jailers
in
alabama.
we
say
that
this
is
not
truly
a
representative
class.
that
the
defendant
there
could
not
represent
all
of
the
others
and
did
not,
and
they
were
not
before
the
court
and
this
order
should
not
be
binding
on
them.
they
ought
to
have
that
day
in
court.
it's
just
elemental
justice.
it's
--
is
that
due
process.
well,
so
much
for
that
aspect
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
yes,
sir.
the
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
now,
here
are
the
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
no,
sir.
the
record
doesn't
show
that
they
are
the
same.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
well,
the
city
of
birmingham
is
a
metropolitan
city.
it's
the
biggest
city
in
the
state.
it's
all
between
three
and
four
hundred
thousand
and
it's
got
a
modern,
up
to
date
jail
and
it's
a
prison,
practically
a
prison.
it's
like
a
well-run
prison.
whereas
our
rural
jails
just
one
man
--
just
one
man
operated
and
frequently
not
anybody
there
at
all.
frequently,
there
is
no
jailer
around.
if
there
is
any
--
should
be
any
trouble
or
any
strike
that
would
break
out
racial
or
otherwise
it
--
they
have
to
anticipate
it
as
best
they
can
and
separate
the
prisons
as
the
judgment
requires
as
best
as
they
can.
now,
that's
true
though
of
the
entire
system,
but
what
i'm
--
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
the
rural
communities,
their
problems
are
not
just
saying
as
the
problems
in
the
well-run,
well-organized,
well-financed
birmingham
city
jail.
so,
i
don't
want
to
take
too
much
time
on
that
procedural
aspect
because
the
heart
of
this
matter
is
the
merits,
not
that
just
procedural
problem.
now,
there
is
one
other
procedural
problem
and
i'll
raise
these
though
primarily
because
there's
been
no
intervening
hearing
of
this
between
the
trial
court
and
you
gentlemen
because
it
came
on
direct
appeal.
now,
it
had
just
been
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
is
another
appellate
court,
that
issue
would
have
been
resolved
there
and
we
could
just
get
to
the
merits.
but
there
is
one
further
procedural
thing
that
i
want
to
point
out
and
that
is
commissioner
frank
lee,
the
head
of
the
state
prison
system,
under
the
court's
order
is
required
to
supervise
not
only
his
prisoners,
but
the
jails
of
alabama,
supervise
the
desegregation.
now
he
has
been
given
responsibility
while
he
has
no
authority.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
only
on
those
jails
in
cities
above
10,000
and
most
of
our
--
well,
i
wouldn't
say
most
of
our
jails,
yes,
i
guess
most
of
our
jails
though
in
cities
under
10,000
a
great
number
are
anyway.
so,
we
seek
to
have
the
commissioner
of
prisons
relieved
from
that
part
of
the
order
which
requires
him
to
supervise
something
that
he's
got
no
authority,
they
just
ignore
it.
now,
the
importance
of
that
though
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
i
concede
that
he
can
supervise
those
or
that
he
can
make
reports
as
to
those
above
10,000,
yes,
sir.
but
i
do
not
concede
that
he
should
because
i
think
as
we
get
to
that
both
to
the
merits.
now,
when
we
get
to
the
merits
we
would
see
that
but
the
two
points
i
want
to
make
of
procedural
–
procedure,
are
these.
number
one,
the
warden
of
the
city
jail
of
birmingham
is
not
representative
sufficiently
of
that
class
for
you
--
for
that
court
to
make
an
injunction
so
to
speak,
where
that
you
could
move
directly
against
these
other
jailers
without
giving
them
their
day
in
court
just
doing
the
ordinary
due
process.
that's
the
first
point
of
procedure.
the
second
part
of
procedure
is
we
seek
to
have
commissioner
lee,
who
is
the
appellant
in
this
case;
we
seek
to
have
him
relieved
from
this
responsibility
of
seeing
that
all
the
jails
are
desegregated
and
we
seek
to
have
him
relieved
of
the
responsibility
of
making
90-day
reports
periodic.
now,
there
are
two
aspects
of
the
merits.
one
relates
to
the
statutes.
the
alabama
statutes
like
many
other
southern
states
require
racial
separation
of
prisoners,
just
blank
it
arbitrarily
racial
segregation
in
prison.
now
that
may
or
may
not
be
constitutional,
i
make
no
point
of
it.
i'll
say
this
that
the
point
is
if
you
void
those
statutes
then
alabama
--
the
alabama
prison
systems
and
alabama
jails
are
like
those
of
all
the
other
states
and
like
the
federal
prisons.
they
are
--
that
they
are
not
hobbled,
the
prison
officials
are
not
hobbled
by
any
arbitrary
requirement
of
separations
but
now
here
is
the
real
problem,
the
second
aspect
of
this
case.
the
court
in
its
effort
to
ensure
desegregation
went
too
far.
they
destroyed
reasonable,
sensible,
common
sense
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
prison
officials.
now,
traditionally
the
courts
have
never
interfered
with
reasonable
prison
management.
that's
just
very,
very
sensitive
area.
you're
not
talking
about
school
children
now.
you're
talking
about
the
most
violent,
the
most
vicious
element
of
our
society,
the
most
dangerous.
many
of
them
are
wanton
killers.
many
of
them
are
troublemakers.
many
of
them
are
just
looking
for
fight
and
trouble.
and
then
--
and
most
of
them
are
extremely
excitable
in
emotional.
now,
the
weight
of
my
argument
to
you
gentlemen
is
this,
not
all
is
common
sense.
you
must
at
least
imagine
and
argue.
you
must
leave
reasonable
discretion
to
the
prison
officials
because
we
are
talking
about
the
safety
of
the
prisoners
themselves,
the
safety
of
the
prison
officials
and
the
integrity
of
the
system.
we're
talking
about
it
--
we
--
all
of
us
want
the
prisons
run
humanely.
now,
when
i
--
when
i
make
this
argument
please
don't
think
that
i
am
urging
that
the
court
cannot
take
a
case
of
racial
discrimination,
invidious
racial
discrimination.
of
course,
that's
justiciable
issue.
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
is,
this
court
must
revise
the
lower
court's
opinion
so
that
it
is
in
line
with
the
great
body
of
law
which
allows
reasonable,
sensible,
discretion
in
prison
officials.
we
separate
that
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
no,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
oh,
no,
sir.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
to
the
contrary
the
record
shows
that
the
prison
--
the
chief
prison
official
stated
that
he
would
make
every
attempt
to
comply
with
whatever
order
was
decided.
and
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
oh!
we
see
that
he
can't,
but
if
you
will
make
a
clear
determination
of
the
law,
a
clear
statement
of
the
law,
we
say
that
that's
enough
because
then
each
instance
of
invidious
racial
discrimination
after
that
will
have
an
opportunity
for
fair
review
and
--
and
the
case
can
be
handled
by
itself
and
that
you
will
not
be
taking
a
precipitous
step
which
will
destroy
the
prison
security.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
yes,
sir.
i
think
there
can
be.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
that
can
be.
now,
i'll
show
you
why.
racial
now
this
--
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned,
for
the
statutes
there
can
be
no
such
–
just
you
recently
decided
this
miscegenation
case
that
the
one
last
cases
i
think
that
you
all
decided.
there
are
some
--
there
is
no
such
thing
as
statutory
distinction
as
to
race.
the
only
thing
i'm
saying
is
if
you
get
a
20
black
muslims
and
20
violent
ku
klux
klan
members
in
the
same
cell,
you're
going
to
have
problems.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
you
need
[attempt
to
laughter]
a
large
cell
with
a
lot
--
a
lot
of
room.
and
along
that
point,
there's
as
many
as
50
--
ours
prison
system
is
so
crowded
right
now,
there
are
as
many
as
15
prisoners
herded
together
at
night
in
one
cell,
many
as
--
many
as
a
150
in
one
barracks.
now,
we
ask
for
time
as
much
as
anything
else.
we
have
let
the
contract
where
our
prison
system
is
being
modified
or
being
stricken.
the
old
one
is
the
old
prison,
the
main
prison
being
destroyed
and
we
are
--
in
july
1969,
we
will
have
a
completely
new
prison
system
which
would
--
which
there's
no
distinction.
there's
no
--
there's
no
distinction
in
areas
or
parts
whether
different
prisoners
will
be
--
they've
already
done
as
much
as
they
can
towards
making
it
fair
for
individuals
whether
it'd
be
white
or
black.
it
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
make
bit
different
job
presentations.
what
we
say
is
just
the
same
as
the
courts
have
repeated
like
hell.
now,
i
circulated
to
you
gentlemen
a
case
which
was
just
decided
and
it
came
to
my
attention
after
the
brief
was
printed,
and
i've
given
opposing
in
counsel
copies.
it
appeared
in
36
law
week
on
page
2235
and
the
case
is
toles
(ph)
versus
katzenbach,
a
federal
prisoner
and
it's
very,
very
important,
toles
(ph)
versus
katzenbach,
and
it
was
decided
in
the
ninth
circuit,
september
27th.
i'll
read
the
head
note
in
the
law,
this
law
week.
federal
prison
officials
acquiescence
in
white
prisoners'
desire
to
exclude
negro
from
all
white
cell.
this
perpetuating
previous
policy
of
racial
segregated
cells
is
not
forbidden
by
the
constitution.
and
the
first
paragraph
reads
this
way,
“the
practice
is
founded
on
interest
of
harmony,
security
and
the
compatibility
of
prisoners
confined
for
long
terms,
all
matters
of
vital
concern
in
prison
operation.
the
practice
in
our
judgment
is
a
reasonable
means
of
furthering
these
interests.
under
this
practice
the
fact
that
the
interests
are
directly
involved
in
a
particular
case
is
not
left
to
assumption
based
upon
experienced
gained
in
other
cases,
but
it's
assured
by
inquiry
in
each
individual
case.
”
now
there
was
a
decision
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
no,
sir.
because
they're
not
quite
the
same,
the
reasoning
though
is
the
same.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
because
--
now
here
--
now
this
--
read
the
one
paragraph
in
the
dissent
that
was
a
dissent,
but
he
did
not
--
this
judge
did
not
dissent
on
the
merits
but
dissented
the
--
because
the
case
was
summarily
handled
and
he
said
that,
“they
should
have
had
a
full
hearing.
”the
majority
quite
properly
states,
the
question
“is
not
whether
segregation
results,
but
whether
there's
an
acceptable
reason
for
the
practice.
”
now,
that
--
that's
what
i'm
saying
is
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
oh
the
statute,
sir?
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
you're
100%
right.
i
know
–
there's
no
question.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
the
statute
is
about
100
years
old.
the
statute
is
about
100
years
old
and
i
have
very
little
doubt
but
that
if
the
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
no,
sir,
[attempt
to
laughter]
they
didn't.
the
statute
is
very
old
and
i
have
very
little
doubt,
but
that
it
will
be
that
part
of
the
lower
court's
decision
will
be
affirmed.
but
i
urge
the
court
to
revise
that
part
of
the
lower
court's
opinion
which
is
just
an
arbitrary
as
that
legislative
pronouncement.
it
says
that
there
shall
be
immediate
and
total.
well,
i
don't
mean
to
use
the
word
immediate.
they
gave
us
six
months
in
certain
fields
and
one
year
in
the
other,
but
the
effect
of
it
is
total
desegregation.
now,
all
that
we
say
is
please
rewrite
that
aspect
of
the
decree
in
line
with
the
--
the
general
body
of
law
which
commits
reasonable,
reasonable
discretion
and
we
separate
prisoners
now
by
age.
we
separate
them
by
sex.
we
separate
them
by
violence,
tendency,
tendency
to
violence,
the
nature
of
the
crimes,
and
there
will
be
occasions
when
we'll
have
to
separate
them
by
race.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
yes,
sir.
they
did
take
affirmed.
practically
every
--
practically
everybody
now,
the
--
they
–
for
it's
physically
possible,
there
is
no
distinction
told
and
everybody
eats
together,
find
a
place
together,
there
are
exercise
period
that
sort
of
thing.
there's
no
--
there's
no
--
there's
really
no
distinction
made
between
the
white
and
the
black
except
that
in
most
areas
still
because
of
the
state
which
permitted
it,
most
area
still
in
the
smaller
places
they
house
them
separately,
if
they
want
to
be
housed
separately.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
now
--
they
–
but
if
you
read
the
rest
of
it,
they
just
limit
to
what
we
call
the
drunk
tank
in
the
birmingham
jail.
now,
if
–-
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
we
think
it
ought
to
be
--
we
think
it
should
be
spelled
out
a
little
bit
more
positively
by
the
court.
now,
we
think
this
that
the
court
can
achieve
what
it
is
after
by
a
strong
statement
of
the
law.
then
with
an
explanation
similar
to
this,
now
i
found
this
wording
yesterday
in
a
–
and
it's
not
in
the
brief,
it's
--
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
in
the
other
side
because
i
would
–
i
--
it's
just
my
argument,
really.
it's
a
federal
supp
263
page
630
particularly
page
631
and
its
ray
versus
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
now
that
was
a
voting
case,
but
it
--
the
law
is
what
--
the
principle
of
what
i'm
arguing.
lawful
incarceration
brings
about
the
necessary
withdrawal
or
limitation
of
many
privileges
and
rights.
a
withdrawal
which
is
justified
by
the
consideration
underlying
our
penal
system.
to
argue
that
incarcerated
--
that
the
incarcerated
person
can
only
be
incarcerated
and
not
be
deprived
of
the
average
person's
ordinary
rights
as
he
would
have
them
if
the
prisoner
was
not
convicted
and
sentenced
and
confined
is
a
matter
of
ordinary
common
logic
absurd.
it
is
only
where
fundamental
humane
and
necessary
rights
are
breached
that
the
constitutional
protections
become
involved.
now
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
that's
263
federal
supplement
630.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
it
is
ray
versus
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
yes,
sir.
now
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
there
are
--
we
don't
have
any
longer
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
--
under
our
new
system.
under
our
new
prison
system
they
won't
be
–-
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
yes,
sir.
there
has
been.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
that's
right.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
i
think
--
and
i
don't
think
that
never
--
i've
never
heard
that
race
before,
never
thought
of
it.
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
yes,
it
is.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
no,
sir.
but
really
all
that
we
seek
to
maintain,
if
all
the
prison
officials
in
alabama
and
throughout
the
nation
the
reasonable
discretion
to
run
that
prisons
for
the
safety
of
the
inmates,
safety
of
the
officials,
and
protection
of
the
public,
that
really
holds
it
and
i
--
and
i
say
that
each
one
--
each
situation
must
be
viewed
in
it's
own
light
at
the
time
and
if
there's
any
invidious
racial
discrimination
that
should
be
corrected
and
can
be
corrected.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
it
is
--
that
is
--
you
can
read
that
in
to
the
case,
but
the
order,
the
order
itself
requires
that
more
is
an
opinion
but
the
order
require
total
desegregation.
now,
if
that
--
if
at
the
end
of
that
it
had
said,
except
in
such
instances
where
in
the
reasonable
discretion
of
the
--
of
the
prison
officials
the
safety
of
the
prisoner
and
the
prison
officials
is
impaired
or
in
danger.
they
would
have
the
authority.
we
--
what
we
really
up
to
is
modifying
that
part
of
the
case,
modifying
that
part
of
the
order
so
that
it'd
be,
everybody
will
understand
that
they
do
have
reasonable
discretion,
but
that
is
all
they
have.
they
do
not
have
any
arbitrary
right
to
separate
this.
the
stat
--
if
the
statute
is
gone
then
alabama
would
be
just
like
--
like
the
federal
prisons.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
your
honor,
if
you
--
if
you
--
you'll
find
it
in
the
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
it's
132
of
the
record.
yes,
that
in
the
last
paragraph.
it
is
further
ordered

of

board
of

for

centers,
and
hospitals
in

to

mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
that
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
that
we
feel
that
that
would
unnecessarily
robs
prison
officials
of
their
right
to
separate
when
race
is
involved
just
like
they
have
the
right
to
do
to
separate
as
to
sex,
age,
and
that
sort
of
thing
whenever
in
that
judgment
it
is
necessary
to
call
the
prison
security.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
yes.
mr.
nicholas

hare
right.
mr.
nicholas

hare
that's
correct.
mr.
nicholas

hare
that
is
correct.
mr.
nicholas

no
sir,
i
wouldn't
think
that
would
be
necessary
to
go
that
far.
mr.
nicholas

no,
sir.
mr.

i
couldn't
in
–
on
a
state
request
that
they
go
that
far.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
without
conceding
the
unconstitutionally
statute
of
the
criticizing
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
i
would
say
that
that
part
of
the
order
should
be
or
could
be
conceivably
affirmed.
the
rest
of
the
decision
should
be
reversed
and
rewritten
by
this
court,
so
that
there's
a
strong
and
clear
pronouncement
of
what
the
law
of
the
nation
is
about
the
separation
of
the
races
merely
hold
that
purpose.
but
leave
it
with
sufficient
discretion
so
that
you
do
not
handcuff
prison
officials,
jailers,
all
of
the
country.
but
if
they
don't
do
what
the
law
--
what
as
you
pronounce
it,
if
they
don't
follow
that
law,
that
rule,
well
then
each
one
of
those
cases
can
be
immediately
taken
care
off.
you
can
see
that
our
district
courts
in
alabama
have
certainly
have
forced
the
law
as
you
pronounced
it.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
in
a
strong
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
that
would
--
no
order
like
this.
yes
sir.
no
order
like
this.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
well,
we
would
prefer
to
be
relieved
from
that
and
let
--
if
--
then
any
if
they
do
practice
any
discrimination,
it
can
be
stopped.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
that's
right.
because
the
condition
is
maybe
different.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
well
–-
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
except
in
order
of
(voice
overlap)
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
except
--
except
in
their
order
they
go
so
much
further
than
that
and
we
feel
too
that
we've
got
here
more
time
because
our
--
our
prison
facilities
are
not
adequate
for
this,
but
we
have
let
the
contracts
and
the
new
plans
for
the
prisons
make
no
--
no
distinction
as
to
race
whatsoever.
it
--
it
--they're
completely
in
a
agreed
prisons.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
june
1969.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
and
it
all
--
yes
sir,
except
in
the
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
because
we
feel
that
the
--
that
the
order
--
that
the
order
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
i
beg
you
sir?
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
one
year
from
december
1966.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
quite
frankly,
we've
never
--
we've
never
considered
that
and
if
we
don't
get
relief
here
we'll
have
to
but
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
well,
that
is
--
that
is
the
program.
yes,
sir.
all
we
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
no,
sir.
except
that
we
feel
that
from
the
tenure
of
the
--
of
the
order
itself
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
yes,
sir.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
oh,
i
don't
think
of
that
but
we
have
the
right
to
go
back
to
that.
but
i
think
that
it's
very
clear
that
this
particular
order
needs
some
modification
so
that
those
judges
will
see
that
reasonable
discretion
must
be
left
and
i
think
more
emphasis
needs
to
be
made
in
that
except
in
unusual
circumstances
because
that's
not
carried
over
to
that
order.
that's
just
a
part
of
the
opinion.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
it
would
be
--
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
–
really
all
we
want
is
that
we
want
the
administrative
officials
in
charge
of
jails
or
prisons
when
they
are
of
the
opinion
that
separation
at
a
time
will
aid
and
maintain
discipline
in
prison
security
that
they're
not
violating
any
judicial
order.
then,
we
can't
wait
until
a
trouble
happens
or
you
can't
--
the
prison
officials
must
the
best
as
he
can
–
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
it
happened
in
california.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
yes,
sir.
it
happened
in
california.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
yes,
sir.
if
he's
one
the
--
if
this
is
not
explained
he
might
really
take
the
chance
then
killing
one
another
and
him
getting
in
trouble
with
the
judge.
he'd
be
in
no
trouble
then,
but
that
certainly
is
not
a
humane
thing.
i
do
want
to
point
out
one
thing
in
the
--
my
reply
brief,
i
have
cited
a
number
of
illustrations
of
just
newspaper
articles
that
have
common
knowledge
so
that
the
court
will
have
before
it
the
recollection
of
how
violent
these
people
are
and
the
prison
officials
must
anticipate
these
things
and
stop
them
before
they
occur.
that's
really
--
that's
really
what
is
the
focus
of
my
argument.
mr.
nicholas
s.
hare
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
justice
stewart
asked
the
question
i
found
the
answer.
with
reference
to
class
representation
of
the
defendant,
the
warden
of
the
birmingham
city
jail
on
page
179,
the
testimony
is,
“in
your
opinion
would
you
say
in
your
opinion
there's
a
substantial
difference
between
the
smaller
town
jails
in
alabama
and
the
city
jails
and
the
birmingham
city
jail
in
facility
supervision
and
the
type
of
control
between
these?
”
answer:
yes,
sir.
so,
i
say
that
the
record
itself
shows
that
there's
not
a
proper
class
action.
and
i
just
want
to
--
want
to
in
passing
just
remember
–
remind
of
the
court
of
the
tragedy
in
florida
when
37
prisoners
burned
to
death
this
last
july
that
it
followed
the
fight
between
colored
men
and
white
men.
it
just
seems
that
