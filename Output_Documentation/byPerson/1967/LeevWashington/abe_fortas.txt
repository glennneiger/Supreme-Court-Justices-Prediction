when

must

your

is

you're
telling

you're
not

that

on

of
the
record
as
i
read
it
the
court
record
said
–
that
if
the
court
said
as
we
recognize
that
there's
merit
in
the
contention
in
some
isolated
instances,
prison
security
and
discipline
necessitates
segregation
on
the
race
for
a
limited
period.
now,
i
think
you're
asked
about
and
i
thought
you
limited
it
to
just
the
growth
thing
but
as
i
look
at
the
footnote
to
that
statement
it
says
for
example,
the
term
used,
you
see
that's
the
bottom,
page

justice
abe
fortas
my
point
here
is
that
the
court
recognized,
it
seems
to
me,
in
this
passage
the
court
recognize
in
general
terms
than
maybe
some
isolated
instances
where
segregation
is
required
and
then
it
cited
the
growth
bank
as
an
example
of
certain
situation
that
as
the
sole
brief
here?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
morgan,
why
did
the
court
put
its
mandate
in
the
form
of
order
rather
than
an
injunction
to
the
various
member
of
the
record,
of
course,
you
made
something
in
the
point
of
that,
that
it
is
not
issuing
an
injunction.
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
implication
to
your
mind
there
is
apparently
drawn
an
inference
that
the
court
wanted
to
obtain
a
little
more
flexibility
before
issuing
sort
of
definitive
mandate
and
they
use
this
form,
this
technique
for
doing
it.
