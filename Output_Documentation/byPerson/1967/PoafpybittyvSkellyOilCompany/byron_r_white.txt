justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
what
if
the
contract
tells
us
that
the
lessee
shall
not
commit
waste
which
this
one
indicates,
it's
still
an
action
on
the
contract,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
just
the
venue
problem.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
state
of
the
question
doesn't
concern
us
up
here,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
all
that
you
want
to
get
across
is
that
this
is
an
action
on
a
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
--
that's
your
real
point
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
--
you
want
to
get
across
the
point
is
an
action
on
this
contract
with
the
secretary
you
claim
has
control
off.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
company
refuses
to
pay
royalty
and
the
indians
who
actually
--
the
indians
signed
this
lease,
didn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
the
lessors.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
indians
are
the
lessor.
if
the
lessees
refuse
to
pay
royalty
and
wrongfully
the
indians
claim
and
they
asked
the
secretary
to
bring
an
action.
he
said
no.
and
the
indians
and
the
secretary
are
in
a
dispute
as
to
what
--
so
there
has
been
compliance.
you
say
that,
the
indians
have
no
remedy
whatsoever
against
the
lessees?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
in
the
departmental?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
what
if
the
secretary
said
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
indians
go
to
the
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
who
do
they
sue?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
with
whom
do
they
sue
if
the
secretary
turns
them
down?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
but
whom
do
they
--
whom
do
they
sue?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
is
bound
that
the
lessee
--
could
the
lessee
can
review
his
orders
too
in
the
same
manner?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
apparently
the
--
apparently
the
secretary
doesn't
believe
that
this
particular
administrative
scheme
was
ever
intended
to
be
--
have
this
kind
of
a
consequence
to
be
this
exclusive.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
he
gave
permission
for
this
suit
to
be
brought,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
just
the
question
of
whether
--
where
they
would
be
doing
their
doubling
back.
you
can
see
that
if
they
make
a
claim,
if
the
secretary
hasn't
adequately
discharged
his
duty
to
his
guardian
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
them,
that
they
can
go
to
the
secretary
--
go
through
an
administrative
procedure
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
i
would
assume
that
the
--
in
that
preceding
you
would
be
right
there.
your
plant
would
be
right
there
at
every
step
of
the
way.
and
then
when
the
secretary
makes
his
own
decision,
if
the
indians
are
dissatisfied,
they
can
take
both
you
and
him
to
the
court.
justice
byron

white
so
after
the
lease
is
over
with
while
the
lease
is
being
administered.
so
it's
just
really
a
question
of,
where
they
are
going
to
be
questioning
the
application
of
this
lease,
isn't
it?
